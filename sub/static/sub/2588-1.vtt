Oh, shot. Ding dong!

05:59.985 --> 06:05.030
Hey, one more week, old son, and you'll
be doing this all day every day.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.408
This is going to be our new office.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.910

- Yeah.

old son. Living the dream.

- Ah, that's not bad.
- Nice one.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.305
- Whoo-hoo!
- Sure we won't be bored now?

06:29.306 --> 06:34.518
Bored? Bored?
What, with all this? Bored!

06:34.519 --> 06:36.136
As if.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.231
- Oh!
- Oh, no. It's not gone again, has it?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.602
- Oh, yeah. Shit!
- Anything I can do?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.946
Yeah, just... just put your...
put your thumb right there, mate.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.450
Oh, I'd better not stand
there. People will talk.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.578
Now, don't forget: always
wash your jeans inside out,

06:52.579 --> 06:54.705
if it looks swollen,
it probably is, and...

06:54.706 --> 06:57.499
and never put anything into your
mouth that hasn't been boiled first.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.502
- Oh, it's Dad.
- Oh.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.462
Hi, Dad.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.213
Hello, my darling.
Have you left yet?

07:03.214 --> 07:04.632
I'm just setting off. I'm with Mum.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.050
'Lucky girl, going to Edinburgh.'

07:06.051 --> 07:09.678
Your Mum and I were quite the
dynamic pair on campus in our day.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.514
Maybe I'll buy a flat near you
and relive my student days.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.726
- Er... no, thanks, Dad. It's my turn.
- 'Yes, it is indeed.'

07:15.727 --> 07:17.853
Don't know where Jerry's going.
No, Jerry's getting lost.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.563
'So what are you gonna
do now you're retired?'

07:19.564 --> 07:21.273
'Oh, I don't know.'

07:21.274 --> 07:24.401
Maybe I'll finally buy that boat and
sail around the world, you know.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.683
- You were gonna do that with Mum.
- 'That's true, I was.'

07:28.156 --> 07:29.531
Dad, I have to go. I've got
a big drive ahead of me.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.160
OK. Call me when you get in, now.
I love you, Sophie.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.528
'Love you too, Dad.'

07:34.829 --> 07:37.998
- He's threatening to relive his student days.
- Mmm.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.043
- What were you two like at college?
- Naive, unrealistic, ill-prepared.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.295
So, everything that I am right now.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.755
Not you, not you, never you.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.883
Not at all. Come on, off you go.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.804
Don't forget to call me when you
get there. Always go out in groups.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.516
If you get homesick, come home.
And try and find a good taxi service.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.309
Because some of them
have women-only drivers.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.805
Women-only drivers, got it.
Anything else?

08:02.232 --> 08:05.431
Be yourself, you're lovely.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.619

08:40.227 --> 08:42.895
Hello, Rumps. Come here.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.775

08:46.776 --> 08:49.153
What shall we do
this afternoon, eh?

08:49.154 --> 08:52.307
Let's get drunk.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.279
Hi, honey, I'm home.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.350
You can hide all you like.

09:20.351 --> 09:24.480
I've spotted you and we should
get a start on your last week.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.398
Yes, of course.
Good morning, Doreen.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.027
It has always been our good
fortune to share the same train.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.738
No rest for the wicked, Mr Jones.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.282
Doreen, after all these years, after
everything we've been through,

09:35.283 --> 09:36.992
are you still refusing
to call me Richard?

09:36.993 --> 09:41.288
Yes! Now, you have a ten o'clock
meeting with the new owners.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.415
- Yeah.
- Any idea who they are?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.692
Hmm...

09:45.668 --> 09:48.128
Young is all I know, Doreen.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.464
I took your advice on their
pension share offer.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.591
- I took them up on it.
- What? The whole lot?

09:52.592 --> 09:56.929
Yes, lots of us did. Janice in
Accounts, Marcus in Payroll.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.181
Well, it's a solid offer.

09:59.182 --> 10:03.132
Now, you have a prostate
check at 2:15 today.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.346
I'm gonna miss these
little chats, Doreen.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.614
I thought my leaving
party was on Friday.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.242
I don't think this is
a party, Mr Jones.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.442
- It's all gone, Richard. The lot!
- What?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.116
Morning, everyone.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.591
Richard, what's going on?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.426
I don't know, Janice.
I have no idea.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.428
- Did you know about this?
- No, of course not, Marcus.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.056
- Is this legal? Can they just do this?
- Yes, of course they can.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.058
Now, wait a minute.
We don't know that.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.227
Just... just give me
some time here, please.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.020
- Will we get paid this month?
- Yes, of course you will.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.523
- Did you know this was coming?
- Of course he didn't!

10:49.524 --> 10:51.942
Someone said the shares are
worthless. Is that true?

10:51.943 --> 10:53.720
- No.
- Yes.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.284
Jesus!

11:00.285 --> 11:05.581
I suppose they'll let us in at some point.
To collect our things, I mean.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.282
Doreen, I promise you,
I will sort this out.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.509
Everyone, listen up! I promise you
I'll get to the bottom of this.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.429
I will find out what's going on
but I just need some time, OK?

11:20.430 --> 11:21.972
What are we supposed to do now?

11:21.973 --> 11:24.933
- How?
- But, Richard, what can you do?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.811
I... I don't know,
but I promise you,

11:27.812 --> 11:31.648
I will make sure that every one
of you gets what they're due.

11:31.649 --> 11:36.270
I will not, will not, let you down.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.366
OK, Jean-Baptiste, here I come.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.754

13:06.744 --> 13:09.037
- Hello, Ken.
- Look, no flowers!

13:09.038 --> 13:10.735
Well done!

13:11.165 --> 13:14.835
- Oh, it's you again.
- Ken. Again, hi.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.462
Kate, I need to speak to you.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.922
- I'll see you...
- Yes...

13:19.924 --> 13:23.248
OK, great. Looking forward.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.431
- Have you been drinking?
- No... Yes.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.808
- Look, what difference does it make?
- A lot of difference.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.853
You're prone to exaggeration
and wild statements of intent.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.855
Look, there are big
problems at the office.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.358
Please, tell it to Anastasia or
Michaela or whoever the latest is...

13:38.359 --> 13:40.652
Culco has gone into receivership.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.780
The new owners have stripped us of any
value and run us into the ground.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.906
The shares are worthless.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.576
My pension, your pension,
was all tied up in those shares.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.662
The mortgage payments on my place,
this place, the kids' university fees,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.987
everything we'd saved up for
them afterwards, it's all gone.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.669
Kate, I virtually had the
whole company on board.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.199
Marcus, Janice, I even
got Doreen involved.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.053
Come on.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.387
What do we know about these guys?

14:07.388 --> 14:10.640
Lavco. They came in hard
and fast out of nowhere.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.018
The holding company traded
by the name of Lexon.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.772
We were persuaded to integrate
our pension fund into theirs.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.316
Turns out Lexon was hollow, toxic.

14:19.317 --> 14:23.236
So when they turned to
dust, so did our pension.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.073
There's always someone
bigger behind these things,

14:26.074 --> 14:29.284
someone who manages to wipe
their hands clean and move on.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.582
- Still allergic to cat hair?
- Worse than ever.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.156
Go on, Rumpy, sit on him.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.295
- I see you got your PhD.
- Yeah.

14:40.296 --> 14:44.716
- So, how's life as a lecturer?
- Under-paid.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.636
- What are the students like?
- Under-motivated.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.764
Could you just stop
fidgeting and sit down?

14:50.765 --> 14:54.893
I'm on the site but I can't get any
real info. I'm being blocked.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.229
We need a password.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.606
- We need...
- Matt.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.816
We need Matt.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.776
'Mum, you do know
hacking is illegal.'

15:02.777 --> 15:05.320
'I know, Matt and I would never
want you to do anything illegal.

15:05.321 --> 15:10.033
'But I wondered if you could just...
accidentally stumble into it.'

15:10.034 --> 15:11.936
Accidentally stumble into it?

15:12.245 --> 15:15.288
- 'Son, do as your mother asks.'
- Dad?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.083
- What are you doing there?
- 'It's a long story, Matty boy.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.128
'But right now it's payback time
on that misspent youth I funded.'

15:21.129 --> 15:22.504
- 'We funded.'
- OK, hold on.

15:22.505 --> 15:26.284
I'll have to use my other
computer. Wait here.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.723
- Is that his roommate, Tyler?
- I think it is.

15:33.724 --> 15:34.975
Oh, Tyler!

15:34.976 --> 15:39.271
- 'Close the door.'
- 'Come on, son. Close it now.'

15:39.272 --> 15:40.897
Mr and Mrs J?

15:40.898 --> 15:43.567
'Yes, we're here on Skype.'

15:43.568 --> 15:45.561
'Sorry.'

15:46.821 --> 15:50.065
'OK, I've emailed you the password.
That will get you in.'

15:50.741 --> 15:52.576
- 'Good man!'
- 'Well done, Matt.'

15:52.577 --> 15:55.446
Oh, and guys... it's really
good to see you together again.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.751
- Oh!
- Hey!

16:01.752 --> 16:03.128
- We're in.
- Good.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.657
I've always wanted to say that.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.467
There we go. Lexon.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.886
Owned by one Vincent
Mathias Kruger,

16:10.887 --> 16:14.264
international hedge fund
manager, born in Budapest,

16:14.265 --> 16:19.060
currently resides in Paris, horribly young,
keen sportsman, patron of the arts.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.854
Oh! Mentor to the young.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.816
Could he look any more like a money
grabbing, cheating, immoral little shit?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.402
But you're not gonna get away with
it, my friend, not on my watch.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.279
- He can't hear you.
- I know he can't hear me.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.573
But he's certainly
gonna feel my wrath.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.243
- OK, Guevara, what's your plan?
- I'm gonna go to Paris.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.496
I'm gonna go to Paris with
what little money I have left

16:37.497 --> 16:40.457
and bang on that man's door so loudly
he's gonna pay for me to go away.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.125
I'm gonna get back
what's rightfully mine.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.251
- Ours.
- Ours.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.880
I didn't work for 25 years in that
God-forsaken job to have some little...

16:46.881 --> 16:48.006
Prick?

16:48.007 --> 16:52.802
prick like him stroll in and
spirit away my, our, retirement.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.640
I'm gonna do it for all the little people
who've done nothing but play by the rules.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.726
For Marcus and Janice,
for Doreen, for you.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.770
No, do not do it for me.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.969
For the kids.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.102
- How's your French?
- Rusty. Why?

17:09.237 --> 17:10.604
<i>Non.</i>

17:11.071 --> 17:15.352
<i>Non, non, non, non, non, non.</i>
Absolutely not. No way!

17:32.218 --> 17:35.136
You missed it again!
I said the second exit.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.346
I couldn't get across.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.473
What do you mean, you couldn't
get across? Just indicate!

17:38.474 --> 17:41.434
I am indicating, darling, but they're
not paying any bloody attention.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.061
How can your driving
not have improved?

17:43.062 --> 17:46.940
You've had years to practise.
Be assertive, man!

17:46.941 --> 17:48.650
Be assertive? Right.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.830
- This is very unlike her.
- She might have got a better offer.

18:01.831 --> 18:06.167
- A better offer than Ken?
- Our dog's a better offer than Ken.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.345
- Let's just get something straight, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.848
- We go, we sort this mess out.
- Uh-huh.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.392
And then we go on with the
rest of our lives, separately.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.591
Sounds good to me.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.149
Come on then, Trotsky.
Let's get this over with.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.450
<i>Merci.</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:54.416
- Hmm... no dice.
- No.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.261
Do you remember that time
at Soph's PTA meeting

18:58.262 --> 19:00.664
when we couldn't get in
to see the headmaster?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.421
- And you...?
- Yeah.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.837
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.401
Oh, sweetheart... Oh, damn!
Oh, dear, dear.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.021
A glass of water, please.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.150
- Which floor?
- Top floor.

19:25.081 --> 19:28.708
- Not bad, Miss Jones. Not bad.
- You never lose skills like that.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.950
- Can you still do that thing with your...
- No, Richard.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.510
- Mr Kruger's office?
- <i>Oui.</i>

19:38.511 --> 19:40.834
<i>- Très bon.
- Quoi?</i>

19:44.684 --> 19:46.309
Mr Kruger, I'm sorry...

19:46.310 --> 19:48.728
It's OK. Can I help you?

19:48.729 --> 19:50.730
You bought the company
I work for last week.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.900
- Pardon?
- And ran it into the ground.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.527
I don't understand, sir.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.680
Vous <i>êtes un</i> money grabbing pig!

19:58.739 --> 20:01.616
- Your company...
<i>- Votre... votre</i> company.

20:01.617 --> 20:06.162
- ...bought my company...
- Hang on... <i>acheté ma</i>... company.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.540
And ran it into the ground.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.409
<i>Et le...</i>

20:10.835 --> 20:14.239
Steady, Kate.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.131
- Steady, Kate. Steady.
- Sorry.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.509
I run a lot of companies into
the ground. Which one?

20:19.510 --> 20:23.304
- Culco.
- Culco, er...

20:23.305 --> 20:27.517
See, that was last week. I very much
live in the now, the <i>maintenant.</i>

20:27.518 --> 20:31.354
Well, maybe this is <i>maintenant</i> enough for you.
You stole all our money and we want it back.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.106
- And you are?
- This is my wife.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.232
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.192
- Ex-wife?
- Yeah, we've established that now.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.236
- So you're not denying it.
- No, I don't think so.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.155
Listen, you, there are
people whose lives

20:40.156 --> 20:42.031
depend on the pension
they were gonna receive.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.026
You can't just throw them away
like that. It's just not fair.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.862
OK, OK, you got me.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.916
What I did was wrong,
reprehensible, evil even.

20:51.917 --> 20:56.671
In a normal world, illegal. But that's
the beauty of it: it's completely legal.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.715
Now, listen to me, you
little sack of shit.

20:58.716 --> 21:02.093
You are messing with people's lives.
Proper, good, hardworking people

21:02.094 --> 21:03.511
who have done absolutely nothing

21:03.512 --> 21:05.555
but play by the bloody rules
laid out in front of them.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.390
Oh, she definitely wears
the trousers, no?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.642
I'm not even gonna rise to that.
Of course she does.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.187
- We're the older generation. We're enlightened.
- We're divorced.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.730
And we're done.

21:13.731 --> 21:17.484
Put me down. Put me down!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

21:17.485 --> 21:21.488
Put me down. Put my wife down!
Put my wife down!

21:21.489 --> 21:22.947
- There you go.
- Ex-wife.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.324
Ex-wife.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.700
- Could have had 'em.
- Shit!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.911
We are totally taking
him down. Totally!

21:27.912 --> 21:29.985
Now what, huh?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.343
Whoo!

21:43.344 --> 21:46.095
Close your mouth. Who do
you think she belongs to?

21:46.096 --> 21:50.546
If I were a betting man,
I'd say... Here you go.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.338
Bingo!

21:57.066 --> 21:58.733
- Quick, let's follow.
- Good idea.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.736
- Let me drive. I'm the better driver.
- No way, José. You forgot your license.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.988
- Come on, Richard. I'm a much better driver.
- You forgot your license.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.365
You're not a better driver.
You just think you are.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.407
You'll regret it.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.202
- Remember Hammersmith bridge?
- That's unfair.

22:09.203 --> 22:13.081
You forgot to put oil in the tank.
You forgot to put oil in it.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.792
- Go fast. Go fast.
- I'm not gonna go fast.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.116
Quickly, they're getting away.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.049
- You've gotta keep up, Richard.
- It's called tailing, Kate.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.623
If we get too close, they'll
know they're being followed.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.972
Well, that was the world's
shortest car chase.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.516
What? It's a red light! You want
me to start running reds now?

22:31.517 --> 22:33.669
No, God forbid, Richard.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.300
Well, that was intense.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.190
Thank you. Could have killed a nun.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.140
Many nuns, possibly.
A whole load of dead nuns.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.697
- Oh, that's them, Richard!
- What?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.657
I've just seen them, Richard!
Please, let me drive.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.701
- Please! Please, let me drive.
- Fine.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.830
OK, OK. It's been a while.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.832
What did you have for lunch?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.359
What?

22:58.961 --> 23:00.962
Buckle up.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.131
Which way are we going?
Kate, we're going backwards.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.883
- Yep.
- Backwards, Kate!

23:04.884 --> 23:06.926
Putting my seat belt on.
Putting my seat belt on right now.

23:06.927 --> 23:11.173
Kate, no, no, no, no!
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

23:12.141 --> 23:14.183
- Argh!
- Hold tight.

23:14.184 --> 23:18.646
I'm holding tight! We can't even
afford the basic insurance.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.024
Oh, fuck the insurance.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.528
Whoo-hoo!

23:25.529 --> 23:28.489
Ha! We did it! There they are.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.366
- All right, now stick it on.
- What?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.244
Track 3, "All Right Now".
It helps me drive.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.832
Where did you learn
to drive like this?

23:37.833 --> 23:40.043
- School run.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.870
- OK. Just walk away. Act natural.
- We can't just leave it here!

24:57.871 --> 25:00.164
- Yeah? OK, all right.
- No, no, no, no, no!

25:00.165 --> 25:02.000
No, you're right. When
you're right, you're right.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.334
Get back in.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.005
- Jesus Christ, Are you mad?
- Sorry, I just panicked there.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.925
- I understand but we've just got to...
- Let's have a cup of tea.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.500
No, it's all right. Stop talking
about tea. We're in France.

25:23.897 --> 25:27.066
- You kept your bag.
- Yeah. So did you.

25:27.067 --> 25:31.988
- Yeah, they've lasted quite well, actually.
- Better than us.

25:31.989 --> 25:36.019
Yeah, well, they came
with a guarantee.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.328
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:42.403
- We'd like two rooms.
- Passports, please.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.668
Here.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.321
- There you go.
- Thank you.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.007
Mrs Jones.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.427
- Well, Ms.
- And Mr Jones.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.763
- Yes.
- And you want two rooms?

25:56.764 --> 25:58.139
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.807
You are brother and sister?

25:59.808 --> 26:00.767
- No.
- No.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.351
A suite, perhaps?

26:02.352 --> 26:04.270
- No.
- Next to each other?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.898
Not necessary, really.
We're divorced. I kept his name.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.441
- Ah, but you kept his name.
- Yes.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.567
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.278
Yes, because it's been mine for some
time. And my kids have it. It's no biggy.

26:12.279 --> 26:18.534
And you are holidaying together to
see if perhaps the flame still burns?

26:18.535 --> 26:21.370
- Yeah, why not? I mean...
- No, so not. The flame is out.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.623
- Oh, no.
- Snuffed, gone.

26:23.624 --> 26:27.335
We are in Paris. You never know...

26:27.336 --> 26:29.454
We do know.

26:30.255 --> 26:35.218
Ah, I'm afraid the only two rooms
I have left are adjoining.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.429
- What about those?
- Oh, no, they are all taken.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.252
We are very, very busy.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.261
- Really?
- We'll take them. Thank you. Bonsoir.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.555
Bonsoir.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.983
Bloody hell. What floor?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.728
- Haven't a clue.
- Christ!

26:55.781 --> 26:58.699
You don't fancy rubbing some Deep
Heat into my coccyx, do you?

26:58.700 --> 27:02.354
- No.
- Just a thought.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.790
Ooh!

27:15.634 --> 27:22.838
You'll never guess
where I find myself.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.769
<i>Pourquoi pas?</i>

27:40.409 --> 27:43.786
There's two bowls down for Rumpus
and the kitchen light is on.

27:43.787 --> 27:47.165
Sophie, darling! Hey,
got your leg over yet?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.958
Hello. Sophie, darling?

27:48.959 --> 27:51.419
You haven't heard from
you mother, have you?

27:51.420 --> 27:55.870
No, it's nothing to worry about. It's just
we were supposed to see her yesterday.

28:13.275 --> 28:18.681
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns,
in all the world, she walks into mine."

28:19.990 --> 28:23.189
What are the chances, eh?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.000
Steak-frites.
That's what you'll have.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.044
Nope. Turned veggie two years ago.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.921
But you love meat.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.049
People change, Richard. But you're
gonna have the cheese soufflé.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.676
- Nope.
- But you love cheese.

28:40.677 --> 28:43.888
- Cholesterol levels change, Kate.
- How's your prostate?

28:43.889 --> 28:46.015
Fully functioning, thank you.
How are your bunions?

28:46.016 --> 28:48.809
Oh, how sweet of you to remember.
Actually, they're awful.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.896
High heels are no longer
an option. See?

28:51.897 --> 28:54.800
Here's to our aging, ailing bodies.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.972
- May I?
- Yes, go on.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.537
Ooh, ooh!

29:08.538 --> 29:10.690
Hey! Hey, sweetie!

29:11.708 --> 29:13.668
How's it going?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.628
Oh, I'm so glad.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.463
And you like the
people in your halls?

29:18.507 --> 29:20.424
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.180
All right, yes, you've got to go.
Of course you've got to go.

29:26.181 --> 29:31.560
Call me... call me later.
Yes, I love you... Bye... bye.

29:31.561 --> 29:37.024
- Rich, what could I say to her?
- It's all right. It's fine.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.804
Oh!

29:42.197 --> 29:44.190
Hey, honey, how's it going?

29:44.658 --> 29:47.561
Yeah? For every party
write an essay.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.401
All right, for every three
parties write an essay.

29:51.915 --> 29:56.460
No. No, no, no. I'm so
proud of you, sweetheart.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.462
Is that what Mum said?

29:58.463 --> 30:01.424
Ah, well, great minds and all that.

30:01.425 --> 30:04.999
Listen, do me a favour, next time
you speak to your Mum, tell her...

30:06.179 --> 30:08.431
Tell her I miss her.

30:08.432 --> 30:09.724
OK.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.377
I love you.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.186
Bye, darling.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.772
- What's got into you?
- I don't know.

30:16.773 --> 30:20.985
Paris, retirement,
spending time with you,

30:20.986 --> 30:23.029
having our money stolen.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.353
That'll do it.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.495
This is nice, right?

30:31.496 --> 30:33.193
Yeah.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.919
Michaela, er...

30:38.920 --> 30:42.173
Just a sec... just one second.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.828
Listen, Michaela, I can't talk
right now. Please understand.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.309
It's OK, I'm just tired.
I'm gonna eat in my room.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.711
Shit.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.689
Guess who's getting married?

31:13.747 --> 31:17.041
Ah! "Vincent Kruger and
fiancée Manon Fontaine.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.419
"Spotted off the coast of Cannes
as they prepare for their big day.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.546
"The upcoming nuptials are
rumoured to be taking place...

31:22.547 --> 31:24.715
"at the Krugers'
19th-century château

31:24.716 --> 31:28.260
"located within the exclusive
enclave of Cap d'Antibes."

31:28.261 --> 31:30.179
We've got to get ourselves
invited to that wedding.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.890
Why? We hate weddings.
It's the only thing we agree on.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.543
Look at her neck.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.228
- Pretty.
- Mm-hmm. What's round it?

31:37.229 --> 31:41.148
- Nice.
- Mmm, nice in the region of 10 million.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.359
Oh, very nice.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.403
I'm pretty sure...
in fact, I'm positive

31:45.404 --> 31:47.113
that's the Eye of the Rainbow.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.990
- I thought I recognised it on her yesterday.
- Ah, the Eye of the Rainbow.

31:49.991 --> 31:53.786
Yes, that sold at Sotheby's recently,
fetching a record price for a single stone.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.955
When did you become such
a diamond aficionado?

31:55.956 --> 31:58.791
Since the kids left home.
Daytime TV.

31:58.792 --> 32:01.536
It's a mine of useless information.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.922
- And, in this case, life-changing information.
- Indeed.

32:04.923 --> 32:09.051
I bet she's gonna be wearing
that rock at the wedding.

32:09.052 --> 32:14.674
That rock is our pension.
That rock is Doreen's pension.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.885
We should nick it.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.279
What?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.990
It's just taking back what he's
taken from us and all the others.

32:30.991 --> 32:31.991
You want to steal a diamond?

32:31.992 --> 32:33.576
Richard, he's not gonna
give us our money back.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.453
Well, that doesn't mean we
suddenly become the Pink Panther.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.706
Why not? Richard, we are screwed.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.541
We have nothing, literally nothing.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.918
Nothing to give the kids. It's
time to take back what's ours.

32:42.919 --> 32:48.883
I'm sick of these fat, greedy, fucker billionaires
taking all our money, just ruining this country.

32:48.884 --> 32:52.636
Well, not this country, actually, because
France has got great social services

32:52.637 --> 32:54.263
and, my word, do they
run a good protest.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.057
It's a stupid idea, Kate.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.393
- Crazy, daft...
- All right, all right.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.842
stupid but brilliant.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.816
- Brilliant idea.
- Yeah?

33:05.817 --> 33:09.141
Why the hell not? If not now,
when? What have we got to lose?

33:09.613 --> 33:13.824
- Apart from our dignity and our freedom.
- Exactly.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.953
- Either way, it's worth investigating.
- Definitely. Let's investigate.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.331
Well, it looks like we're
heading to the south of France.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.236
Ah, together! What a good idea.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.088
Delightful. Isn't she beautiful?

33:28.089 --> 33:31.288
- She is.
- Shut up.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.774
Yes, yes. Yes, I understand.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.735
What do you mean,
they won't take it?

33:49.736 --> 33:51.888
Cut it up?

33:53.031 --> 33:58.232
Well, that's end of the credit
cards. Gone, kaput.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.990
- Who are you texting? You're like a teenager.
- No one.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.751
- She's gorgeous.
- Not my type.

34:05.752 --> 34:09.295
Oh, right, yeah. Legs up to the
ceiling and arse as tight as a plum.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.672
Of course she isn't.

34:10.674 --> 34:17.012
Once maybe, but not anymore.
I like things a bit more... homely.

34:17.013 --> 34:21.759
If that was an attempt to flatter
me, you can piss right off.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.478
Look, the legs aren't nearly
as good in real life.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.565
They've clearly been airbrushed.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.442
- Steady. Handbrake off.
- I've got it.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.652
It's off.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.862
You've got it now.
OK. Where's she going?

34:34.864 --> 34:36.891
Just try and look like a tourist.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.002
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.593
Blimey!

35:12.110 --> 35:13.569
You should go in there.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.404
- Go and check the place out.
- I can't go in there.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.977
Go on, go on.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.423

as a business meeting.

Love is easy to fall into.
Liking is much harder.

as a driving test.

38:06.618 --> 38:10.864

and tell me what you found out?

39:16.020 --> 39:18.856
I found out that I
chafe very easily.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.275
- Oh, my poor girl. I'm so sorry.
- Get off.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.902
And the Wedding's
obviously invite only.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.029
But she is definitely gonna
be wearing the diamond.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.365
She's gonna change halfway
through the evening.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.200
That sounds good. Anything else?

39:30.201 --> 39:33.120
Not really, just that she's
pissed off with the evil one

39:33.121 --> 39:35.664
for inviting a couple of Texan
businessmen they've never met before.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.916
Of course she's pissed off. She'll
end up looking after their wives.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.751
And she's right, it's
bang out of order.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.122
She didn't happen to mention
where they might be staying?

39:43.298 --> 39:45.007
'So what are we
stumbling into today?'

39:45.008 --> 39:47.801
The Carlton Hotel, Cannes.
Their guest list.

39:47.802 --> 39:51.179
We're looking for four guests
with home addresses in Texas.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.389
'Dad, that is so illegal.'

39:52.390 --> 39:55.893
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, son.
I wouldn't ask unless it was really...

39:55.894 --> 39:58.812
'Dad, I'm only kidding. We do
that sort of shit all the time,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.857
'messing with people's reservations,
putting people in the same room.'

40:01.858 --> 40:03.859
- Not good, Matt.
- No, no.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.728
'Hold on.'

40:06.279 --> 40:10.980
- Do you think his eyes looked a bit red-rimmed?
- Just a little.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.200
- Oh, he's not, is he?
- Yep.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.835
- Tyler!
- Tyer! Oi!

40:21.836 --> 40:24.004
Tyler! Tyler! Hello!

40:24.005 --> 40:25.380
- 'Hello.'
- 'Hello.'

40:25.381 --> 40:28.467
You've got to be kidding me!
You guys, again.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.246
Nice to see you, Tyler.

40:31.429 --> 40:36.391
'OK, we've got one Mr and Mrs
Hicks of Houston, Texas.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.352
'They're assigned
to the Monet suite.

40:38.353 --> 40:41.848
'And one Mr and Mrs Baxter. They're
across the hall in the Manet suite.

40:42.106 --> 40:46.234
'Anyway, guys, I've got to go.
But the south of France?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.487
'I am loving my new glam parents.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.014
'See you later.'

40:53.451 --> 40:56.161
- OK, so let me just get this straight.
- Hmm.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.623
We are going to kidnap four
Texans, pretend to be them,

40:59.624 --> 41:01.583
go to a wedding in a château,

41:01.584 --> 41:04.795
somehow swap out the necklace,
and make our escape?

41:04.796 --> 41:07.172
I know, it sounds absurd.

41:07.173 --> 41:12.135
- Absurd, yes. Crazy, daft, stupid.
- All right, all right.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.721
But brilliant.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.348
- Yeah?
- One small problem.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.142
There are four Texans
and we are but two.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.011

I cannot tell you how happy we
are to see you back together.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.829
- Well, Pen...
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

42:20.830 --> 42:23.290
And I don't mind telling you, it's
been an absolute nightmare for us,

42:23.291 --> 42:24.708
having to choose between you.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.334
Damn shame, the whole
bloody business.

42:26.335 --> 42:29.158
Anyway, thrilled to be here,
glad to help. What are we doing?

42:29.172 --> 42:30.297
Well...

42:35.970 --> 42:40.170
- Kidnap? Stealing a diamond?
- Gatecrashing a wedding?

42:40.892 --> 42:43.351
- Can we have... a moment?
- It's a lot to take in.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.722
Talk about it. Go ahead.
I've got your bag.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.430
What do you think?

42:50.526 --> 42:52.974
- He's in. She's not.
- Probably.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.741
Well... all right, we're in.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.816
- Spot of lunch first?
- Yes!

43:13.716 --> 43:16.843
Right. Everyone clear on the plan?

43:16.844 --> 43:20.055
I tell you, I haven't been
this pumped since Shanghai.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.014
Shanghai?

43:21.015 --> 43:22.766
Yeah, you know, when I was
in the Merchant Navy?

43:22.767 --> 43:24.768
- Merchant Navy?
- Woman in every port, eh, Jerry?

43:24.769 --> 43:28.396
That sort of thing, yeah. It's
only a bit of boys' banter, Pen.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.398
Pen, are you sure
these are gonna work?

43:30.399 --> 43:32.192
Yes, three of those and
they'll be out like a baby.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.985
- Five minutes tops.
- I can vouch for that.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.905
- Who prescribes them for you?
- That lovely young Dr Jenkins.

43:36.906 --> 43:38.532
Oh, yes. I've heard he's lovely.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.868
Yes, terribly helpful.
And the warmest hands.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.662
Excuse me?

43:43.663 --> 43:45.539
How will we know who they are?

43:46.666 --> 43:48.125
Well, I think we'll know.

Actually, I might go as well.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.158
You know what?
I need one too, actually.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.937
Well, it's never good to ignore it.

Oh, God, I hope we didn't
tie their hands too tightly.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.691
Oh, do you think?

45:36.692 --> 45:41.196
That was insane. I haven't had
this much fun since I was in Guam.

45:41.197 --> 45:42.155
Guam?

45:42.156 --> 45:44.324
I was stationed there
during my military service.

45:44.325 --> 45:46.243
Oh, God!

45:46.244 --> 45:47.744
Jerry! That's stealing!

45:47.745 --> 45:51.081
Pen, Pen, Pen. This is real.
This is happening.

45:51.082 --> 45:54.656
We either step up
or we get crushed.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.836
- Silly man. Stop showing off.
- Right.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.548
Let's pick up the replica necklace, back
to the hotel, cocktails and supper.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.748
Yee-ha! Ride 'em, cowboy.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.098
Jerry, how on earth did you
know where to find someone

46:08.099 --> 46:10.058
who could make a replica necklace?

46:10.059 --> 46:12.394
Well, you know...
I have my contacts.

46:12.395 --> 46:14.688
Contacts? No, Jerry we don't.

46:14.689 --> 46:19.150
Well, if you must know, I once had
a brief, er... affair of the heart

46:19.151 --> 46:20.777
with a young jewellery designer.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.823
Affair of the heart with a
young jewellery designer!

46:24.824 --> 46:26.283
Calm down, Pen. It's all right.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.965
Yeah, don't worry, Pen. It's all
in the past, all forgotten.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.871
This is the basic
layout of the château.

46:31.872 --> 46:33.999
Do you know where all
the guards might be?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.584
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yes.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.712
- No Jerry?
- No.

46:38.713 --> 46:40.297
Rushed off while I
was having a bath.

46:40.298 --> 46:44.301
Said he had to meet a man about
something. Very odd, the whole thing.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.636
Anyway, don't let him spoil this.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.306
This is lovely, seeing the two
of you being back together.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.961
Sorry, everyone. Got held up.
Quick little mission.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.855
I was just saying this is lovely and it's
lovely to see our friends back together.

46:56.856 --> 46:59.691
- Pen, can we get back to the plan?
<i>- Absolument. Pardon.</i>

46:59.692 --> 47:02.485
Now, this is where the guests
will be making their entrance.

47:02.486 --> 47:04.696
And we will be required to
show our invitations here.

47:04.697 --> 47:07.324
Now, you are going to be the
Baxters and we will be the Hicks.

47:07.325 --> 47:10.285
- And actually, Matt... Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

47:10.286 --> 47:12.537
Matt has done some
research into each couple.

47:12.538 --> 47:14.164
- Hey! Your Matt?
- Our Matt.

47:14.165 --> 47:16.249
- Such a bright boy.
- Thank you.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.126
Not like our Tim, is he?

47:18.127 --> 47:20.086
- That's disloyal, Jerry.
- Well, I was just being honest.

47:20.087 --> 47:23.214
He's an academic disaster zone,
isn't he? Police tape all around him.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.549
Jerry!

47:24.550 --> 47:27.761
Now, we know that the bride will retire to
her bedroom at some point during the night

47:27.762 --> 47:30.513
to change her frock and the new frock
will be accompanied by the diamond.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.892
Now, hopefully, Richard and I will
have gained access through here.

47:33.893 --> 47:37.520
We'll attempt to swap out the diamond,
delivering the real one into your arms, Jerry.

47:37.521 --> 47:40.482
Now, you two will leave the party
early and if anything happens to us,

47:40.483 --> 47:42.567
if we get caught, we're
just a disgruntled employee

47:42.568 --> 47:43.860
and his pushy ex-wife

47:43.861 --> 47:45.904
who've had their pensions
stolen and won't go away.

47:45.905 --> 47:49.616
They'll find nothing on
us and they'll let us go.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.326
- Right.
- Or they'll kill us.

47:51.327 --> 47:53.161
Chop us up and throw us in the Med.

47:53.162 --> 47:54.871
- Oh, God.
- Richard!

47:54.872 --> 47:58.116
It's out there. It's a possibility.

48:00.461 --> 48:04.130
Jerry, why do you keep winking at
Richard and patting your pocket?

48:04.131 --> 48:06.716
What? What are you talking about?
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.259
I know when you're lying.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.470
Get off me, woman. Whey-hey!
What are you doing, woman?

48:10.471 --> 48:13.465
- Hey! Ho-ho!
- God, he's got a gun!

48:14.058 --> 48:15.183
What?

48:15.184 --> 48:17.394
Don't advertise it to the
whole flipping restaurant!

48:17.395 --> 48:19.771
Why have you got a gun and why
have you brought it to dinner?

48:19.772 --> 48:21.481
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy? Me?

48:21.482 --> 48:25.485
- Kate, Richard, talk to him.
- Jerry, actually, why have you got a gun?

48:25.486 --> 48:29.531
It's a replica. Calm down. We just
thought it was a good idea, that's all.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.408
It's a real one, actually. They
didn't have any replicas left.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.744
- Bloody hell.
- We? So you're behind this brilliant plan?

48:34.745 --> 48:36.955
Richard, have you led Jerry astray?

48:36.956 --> 48:40.083
- What? No! It was his idea.
- Led me astray? I'm not a flipping child.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.501
They were my contacts.

48:41.502 --> 48:44.838
Jerry, where did you get this?
I demand to know!

48:44.839 --> 48:49.092
Well, it's someone I
knew a long time ago.

48:49.093 --> 48:51.928
I was passing through
France on my way to Guam.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.889
How come I don't know anything about this?
I've been married to you for 35 years, Jerry.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.350
- You've completely spoiled the whole evening.
- All right, love.

48:57.351 --> 48:59.594
- Have some more wine.
- Just have a bit more wine.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.730
Let's at least see it, then.

49:02.731 --> 49:04.607
- Yeah, let's have a look.
- See what?

49:04.608 --> 49:07.235
- The gun, Jerry.
- What? You want to see it?

49:07.236 --> 49:09.696
- I do, actually.
- Let's have a look. Come on.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.698
- Come on, then.
- All right.

49:11.699 --> 49:14.701
- All right.
- Nobody's watching.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.855
Hey-hey! Have a look at that.
All right, all right. One at a time!

49:19.832 --> 49:22.030
Whoops, sorry.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.237
Oh!

49:29.425 --> 49:31.801
Freeze, you melon farmers.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.636
- Steady, Pen.
- Oh, sorry.

49:33.637 --> 49:34.762
Put it down.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.082
Jesus Christ!

49:38.851 --> 49:40.393
All right, er...

49:40.394 --> 49:42.437
- Out the door. Shall we?
- Yeah. Drink up.

49:42.438 --> 49:44.063
The bill, please.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.024
Well, that was
something, wasn't it?

49:46.025 --> 49:48.151
- Do you'll think we'll get arrested?
- No.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.777
Oi, chaps, chaps. Good news.

49:49.778 --> 49:52.822
I've just been talking to the owner.
Turns out we were in the Legion together.

49:52.823 --> 49:55.408
He says if we, er... pay for
the wine, everything's OK.

49:55.409 --> 49:57.452
- Fantastic.
- Oh, fabulous.

49:57.453 --> 50:01.581
- I feel a bit giddy, Jerry.
- Oh, I say! You all right there, Pen?

50:01.582 --> 50:03.875
- Bedtime for us all.
- Right-o.

50:03.876 --> 50:05.653
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

50:07.713 --> 50:11.966
- What are you doing?
- Well... they seem so happy.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.969
You know, with the idea of us.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.639
I don't want to spoil it
for them, that's all.

50:17.640 --> 50:21.059
Just... oh... just...

50:21.060 --> 50:22.727
Just...

50:22.728 --> 50:25.688
Oh... Oh!

50:25.689 --> 50:28.137
Oh, that feels good.

50:30.110 --> 50:33.309
Do you think we're
doing the right thing?

50:33.948 --> 50:38.243
You know, diamond
stealing and kidnapping.

50:38.244 --> 50:41.193
Without a shadow of a doubt.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.408
Sit down for a minute.

50:54.426 --> 50:56.794
I said sit.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.967
Lying down is fine too.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.395
Pen and I had a gin, doubles.

51:05.396 --> 51:08.815
I just can't take it. I can't take my
booze anymore. That's the thing.

51:08.816 --> 51:13.062
Well... it just whips my arse.

51:13.195 --> 51:16.072
You're much more likeable
these days, you know?

51:16.073 --> 51:18.942
That's nice. Thanks.

51:20.244 --> 51:22.442
So are you.

51:23.247 --> 51:26.446
We were much too young when we met.

51:28.127 --> 51:31.326
We should have met now instead.

51:33.757 --> 51:36.956
I don't think it works like that.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.881
Why not?

51:45.394 --> 51:49.844
Why did the latest one leave you?

51:53.611 --> 51:55.638
She didn't, actually.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.273
I left her.

52:02.911 --> 52:04.654
Hmm.

52:06.582 --> 52:08.875
- How's your back?
- Terrible.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.404
How's your bunions?

52:11.754 --> 52:14.282
Oh, excruciating.

52:15.924 --> 52:18.452
Sweet dreams.

52:19.094 --> 52:21.292
Night-night.

52:23.599 --> 52:25.467
Oh.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.521
- Oh, God! We didn't, did we?
- No.

52:30.522 --> 52:33.721
Oh! Thank God.

52:34.234 --> 52:36.361
You don't have to sound
so relieved about it.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.117
Oh.

52:44.745 --> 52:48.399
I haven't had sex for two years.
I'd like to have remembered it.

52:52.461 --> 52:56.297
Jerry, try this. Please,
cos it's so juicy. Go on.

52:56.298 --> 52:58.424
See what I mean? Gorgeous.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.385
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Here he is.

53:00.386 --> 53:01.594
- Hello.
- The stallion.

53:01.595 --> 53:04.180
Didn't get much sleep last
night, old son, did you?

53:04.181 --> 53:07.225
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, the old bed did shake, eh?

53:07.226 --> 53:10.019
- Only my snoring, Jerry. That's all it was.
- Right you are.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.064
Looks like we've got a bit of a problem.
Matt did some digging around last night.

53:13.065 --> 53:15.566
Apparently there are going
to be fingerprint sensors

53:15.567 --> 53:16.776
at the entrance to the party.

53:16.777 --> 53:19.320
Everyone's going to be scanned
before they're allowed in.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.906
- It's worse than Fort Knox.
- Mm-hmm.

53:21.907 --> 53:25.652
We could shave off their fingertips
and stick them onto ours.

53:26.286 --> 53:28.788
The Texans, I mean.
I saw it in a film once.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.915
- Pen...
- Oh, sorry.

53:30.916 --> 53:33.543
- I do get carried away.
- Good to think outside the box.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.712
We should go with something a
bit more mainstream, though.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.338
- Can everyone swim?
- Yes.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.716
- How about climbing?
- Have you ever climbed, Jerry?

53:39.717 --> 53:41.092
- He has not.
- Yeah, I have.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.593
- I have.
- Jerry! When?

53:42.594 --> 53:46.097
- When?
- I was in the Australian Parachute Regiment.

53:51.145 --> 53:52.603
7:28.

53:52.604 --> 53:54.313
- 7:32.
- 7:32.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.523
6:30.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.151
- Jerry, you're still on English time.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

53:58.152 --> 54:00.236

55:39.753 --> 55:41.450

55:42.005 --> 55:44.874
- Jerry!
- It's OK.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.562
- All right?
- Yeah.

56:07.865 --> 56:11.367
Oh... Oh, Jesus.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.396
You're scared of heights. How
could I forget? Are you all right?

56:14.872 --> 56:17.123
I'm fine, thank you.

56:17.124 --> 56:19.417
- Pen, you're squashing my head!
- Ssh, ssh!

56:19.418 --> 56:21.616
I'm sorry, darling.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.973
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!
- I've got you. I'm here.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.893
Well done, Jerry.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.762
Right.

56:38.854 --> 56:41.814
- Have you got the gun?
- No, sorry, Richard.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.358
I put my foot down. I just
decided it was too dangerous.

56:44.359 --> 56:46.694
- Quite right.
- I simply don't trust myself around it.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.238
But I made sandwiches, egg mayo.
Anyone hungry?

56:49.239 --> 56:51.824
- Oh, great, I'm starving.
- Pen, I think we should get on.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.784
Yeah, come on, this way.

56:53.785 --> 56:55.812
Stay close to me, Jerry.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.775
You look fine in that hat.

57:25.776 --> 57:28.152
Mr and Mrs Chambord, from Qatar.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.528
<i>- Bonsoir.

Thanks for coming.

Mr and Mrs Hicks and Mr and Mrs
Baxter from Houston, Texas.

57:44.419 --> 57:46.671
- Ah, that's us!
- Hey! <i>Bonsoir.</i>

57:46.672 --> 57:49.215
- So glad you made it. Long way to come.
- Howdy partner!

57:49.216 --> 57:52.343
- Real great to be here.
- We'll find time to talk later. Welcome.

57:52.344 --> 57:54.637
Of course, this is not
really a wedding.

57:54.638 --> 57:56.806
- It's a chance to do some business.
- Sweetheart.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.934
Well, you're not to bore us with all that
oil talk. I'm here to have some fun.

57:59.935 --> 58:03.646
Oh, we like fun, don't we?
Come along, missy.

58:03.647 --> 58:06.846
Thank you. It's a
mighty fine château.

58:07.734 --> 58:10.387
Mr and Mrs Beltrami, from Rome.

58:14.950 --> 58:18.945
- I think that went quite well.
- For now.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.622
Let's blend in.

58:21.623 --> 58:25.167
Darling, I need to powder my nose. Would
you be so kind as to accompany me?

58:25.168 --> 58:27.294
- It would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

58:27.295 --> 58:29.255
- Ey-up.
- Jerry!

58:29.256 --> 58:33.509
Merci. Well, Kate said
to blend in, didn't she?

58:33.510 --> 58:36.254
- Here's to us.
- Yeah.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.394
- Which floor?
- Second floor.

58:43.395 --> 58:45.263
Right.

58:46.773 --> 58:48.641
Right.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.226
Back in a tick.

59:20.348 --> 59:26.380
That's it, that's her room.
OK, Jerry. 30 seconds.

59:27.522 --> 59:30.357
Howdy, partner! How ya doin' there?

59:30.358 --> 59:33.527
- Come on.
- I'm looking for the old John Wayne.

59:33.528 --> 59:39.325
The, er... pissoir, the,
er... bog crapper? Any idea?

59:39.326 --> 59:42.195
Sorry, sir, downstairs.
This floor is private.

59:47.918 --> 59:50.920
Her window's open and there's
a ledge running to it.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.546
A ledge? Ledge?

59:52.547 --> 59:55.746
More like a balcony. Hold those.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.842
- Slow, slow, slow.
- I am going slow.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.736
- Don't look down.
- I'm not bloody looking down.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.185
Oh... Oh!

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.450
Turn around, turn around.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:26.497
See? Turn around. There you go.
That's it. You're all right now.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:29.993
This is good. I got it.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.879
Well done. Well done.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.750
You're being very brave.
You're being very, very brave.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:40.791
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.305
Oh, fuck!

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.515
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.964
I've got you. I've got you.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:52.637
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.659
- Cats.
- And flowers.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.053
The 19th century.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.565
I'm gonna get changed.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.343
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.848
Go with her.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:13.804
Ssh...

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.534
I'm coming.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:32.907
Come in! <i>Entrez!</i>

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.020
What?

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.564
- You want to watch me get dressed now?
- Eh?

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:59.933
Get out! Get out!

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:12.647
She just... OK.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.653
Ssh!

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.049
Oh, sorry. You're probably
wondering what I am doing.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.261
- It's not...
- I'm so glad you're here.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.595
Oh, there, there.

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:33.684
Now, just sit down and tell Auntie...
Miriam all your worries.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.311
What's the matter?

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:38.480
I've made a terrible mistake.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:42.234
He does not love me.
He never has and he never will.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.903
I've sold myself to the devil.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:49.158
- I'm a whore. I'm a devil's whore.
- No, no, you're not.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.161
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.621
No, no, no, you're not.
Of course you're not.

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:59.918
Yes, I am. I'm a terrible,
horrible, shallow person.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:02.546
I am a fake. I am a fake.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:06.008
I am a fake. I am a fake.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.509
No, don't say that about yourself.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:13.182
From what I can tell, you're a highly original,
slightly highly strung, bright, imaginative girl.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.641
- Really?
- Yes.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:17.102
- You really think so?
- I do. I do. Really.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.356
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:24.651
Oh, no! Oh, thank you.
Thank you, you're so nice.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.474
No, I'm not, really.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:36.038
Please excuse me.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.362
There, there, Manon.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.043
Why are you crying?

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:45.047
- Me? Oh, it's the flowers. I'm, er... allergic.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.091
- It's all right.
- Oh.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.385
No, no, no, Manon.
It's fine, really.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:54.917
- No, don't do that.
- Bloody things! I don't like them anyway.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.363
- What would you do?
- Me?

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:13.784
Yes. You're clearly a woman of the
world. What do you think of him?

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:15.411
- Your husband?
- Yes.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:20.040
- Well, I mean, he's fine. He's...
- Fine?

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.709
Actually, I think
he's a bit callous.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:26.213
I'm sorry, I think
you could do better.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:28.006
I think he probably...

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:31.552
I think he probably treats you
like a piece of jewellery.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.220
I think he probably
treats you badly.

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:37.224
That's not to say he can't change.
I mean, they can change. People do change.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:42.729
But it's easy to say I love you while
you're rolling around on expensive sheets.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.600
It's so much harder
when they need washing.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:54.533
Look, I'm not who you think I am. I'm
sorry, I'm not Miriam from Weymouth.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:58.078
I'm not even Katie from Texas.
I'm just Kate from Surrey.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.873
And my ex-husband is lying on the
floor next to your bed, I'm afraid.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.708
- He is?
- Yep.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.612
Oh! Hello.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.672
- Hi.
- And why are you crying?

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:11.300
The cats. But don't throw
them out the window.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:17.139
- Oh, he's really handsome.
- I know. It's irritating.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.850
- Not sure about the moustache.
- I agree.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.728
The thing is, you see, your
husband stole something from us

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.438
and from a lot of other
very good people.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:27.733
Something very valuable
to us: our future.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:34.364
And so we came here tonight to take
back what we feel is rightfully ours.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.366
Oh. The diamond.

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:39.870
- It's not very imaginative, I grant you.
- Sorry, my back was killing me.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:45.876
- Manon, open up. It's Vincent.
- Take it. I don't like it anyway.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.746
Great. Here's the fake.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:52.382
Manon!

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.704
What?

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.808
Why are you throwing
flowers out the window?

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:06.009
I'm allergic. Don't you
know anything about me?

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:12.767
You must take good care of this.
It's not a toy, it's very valuable.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.364
More valuable than me?

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:21.537
Darling, there is nothing on earth that is
more valuable to me than me... than you!

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.940
You should know that.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:32.707
And will you still love me even
when we are washing the sheets?

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.208
Ssh!

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.062
What are you doing?

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.981
I don't know. I thought
you were about to sneeze.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:52.226
- Causing a distraction's supposed to stop it.
- That's hiccups.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.850
Ah... yes.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:58.441
I might sneeze again.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.039
What are we doing?
We've got to get out of here.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.958
Oh, OK.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.236
- What, back the way we came?
- Yes!

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:33.024
- Oh! Sorry, old partner.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:34.551
Yeah, howdy.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.537
Although not on the official schedule, my
new wife would like to say a few words.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:54.171
A wise woman once told me that
you can love your husband

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.465
but you must also like him.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:02.179
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.301
And I finally realised that...

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:13.054
I don't love Vincent
or even like him.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.938
So Vincent, darling...

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:22.316
I want a divorce.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:37.791
Stop! Stop! There's been
a travesty of justice.

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.551
Catch them!

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:42.919
Catch them!

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:48.042
Hey! <i>Vive la révolution!</i>

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.676
<i>Vive la révolution!</i>

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:53.089
Oh!

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.643
- Oh, my God, no!
- No, no.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.272
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.039
Ooh! Ow!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.569
I knew there was something
familiar about you.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.461
Ooh!

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.796
Ow!

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.574
Oh, no! They're real.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:25.595
OK, let's make this simple.
Where is the real diamond?

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.434
Bloody hell.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:40.277
- Oh!
- Oh, that's a whole other level of pain.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:45.240
Look, we're just a disgruntled employee and
his pushy wife who want back what's theirs.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.367
- You didn't say ex-wife.
- No, I didn't, did I?

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:49.244
- Mmm...
- We should focus.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.898
- Right.
- Have you ever heard of karma?

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.625
Perhaps you're being punished
for all the bad things

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:58.779
that you might have
done in your life.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.534
It's just a thought.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:07.846
Oh, no! That's just mean!
You're just being a bully now!

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.170
Be grateful, I don't hit women.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:15.050
Now, tell me where my diamond is!

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.988
I swallowed it.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.874
I sold the diamond.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.209
What?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:40.284
I swapped it and sold the real one.

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:45.967
Gave the money to charity,
an orphanage in Calcutta.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.636
What? Why?

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.347
A test, to see if you
really loved me.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.266
You're crazy. I'll
deal with you later.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.920
Get rid of them.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.437
Oh, no.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.940
OK, er...

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:02.526
If I'd known, I'd have
worn better underwear.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:05.111
I don't think it's your underwear
you should be worrying about, Pen.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.072
- These things reveal everything.
- What do you mean?

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:10.101
- Yeah, every nook and cranny.
- Oh, God!

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.400
What are you looking at?

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:18.655
Damn cheek!

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.802
Oh, yes, that's, er... Saigon,

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:32.305
Vietnam, 1964.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.850
Took a bit of shrapnel, yeah.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:38.596
Bloody hell, they left some forceps
in there. Look, the clamp's in there.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.438
- I didn't know that.
- You can go.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:41.965
Bloody Vietnam.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.945
- Take them to the cliff.
- Huh? The cliff?

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.656
Whisky? A last drink?

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:52.158
Not my tipple.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.667
- I do hope they'll be all right, Jerry.
- I'm sure they'll be fine, love.

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.445
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.725
Stop whistling, Richard.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.853
- Please, stop whistling. It drives me mad.
- Helps me relax, Kate.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:22.564
Well, it doesn't help me relax.
It's driving me bloody mad.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.842
OK, I'll stop. I've stopped
whistling now, OK?

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.208
We've stopped.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:44.031
Yes.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.749
- We're moving.
- Yes.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.731
- Kate.
- What?

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.733
- I just wanted to say...
- What?

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:08.944
I just wanted to say, Kate,
that whatever happens...

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:13.521
- You're not trying to do a final speech, are you?
- No, not at all. Well, maybe a little.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.787
It's just that...

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.413
- Shut up!
- All right, I will.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.321
Oh!

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.949
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.204
Don't... move.

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:48.066
- Oh.
- Ohh!

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.276
- What's going on?
- We're going back. We're going back!

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.988
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:55.391
No, no, no, no.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.160
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, Kate.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.537
What for?

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.282
For not being a good husband.

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.084
I'm sorry too, then.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.128
For what?

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.879
For not letting you be one.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.673
What do you mean?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.508
- We were too young.
- Uh-huh.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:18.164
It takes two, you know, to totally ruin
a marriage, and I played my part.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.681
Oh, God!

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.308
Anyway, what does it
matter now? We're...

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:26.213
We're going to die!

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:33.767
- Richard!
- It's OK. I've got you. Hold on.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:38.358
Kate, I think we should try again.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:42.120
- Try what again?
- Me and you.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.205
What are you talking
about, Richard?

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.750
I think we should finally sail round the
world, like we've always talked about.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:48.877
I've had such a great
time these past few days.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.464
Could you just concentrate?
Concentrate on holding on!

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:55.425
- Well, don't you feel anything, Kate?
- Yes, fear!

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:57.874
All right. OK.
Well, just think about it.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:02.849
I like you, I really like you.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.674
Come on, you fucker!

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.556
Come on!

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.080
- Are you OK?
- Manon!

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:29.084
- Manon!
- Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you!

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:33.004
Oh, no, it is I who should be thanking
you for making me see things clearly.

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:34.422
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.415
We must go. Help me.

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:40.970
Here we go.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.406
- Nice girl, passionate.
- Oh, I do hope she'll be all right.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:02.980
Oh, a headstrong girl
like her, she'll be fine.

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:04.911
We're gonna have to swim
out of here. You know that?

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:08.414
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Yeah, well, do you have a better idea?

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:09.916
I know a man with a boat.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.239
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:20.969
- Online?
- Yes, Richard, online.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:26.432
You chat, you get to know each other, and you
agree to meet up, if you like each other.

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.726
- But you've never met him?
- No, not yet.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.436
So you don't even know
if you'll like him.

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:32.147
Well, he's 57. He lives in Paris

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.566
and has house and a boat in the
south of France. What's not to like?

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:37.891
Good heavens, Kate!
How shallow you've become.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:43.650
That must be the captain.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:50.150
Bonjour, Kate.
It's me, Jean-Baptiste.

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.034
Bloody hell!

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.012
You know, I'm twice your age.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:07.098
What can I say? I like older women.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.559
Why lie on your profile?

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.606
I want women to see me as a mature man.
Otherwise, I feel like a total cliché, you know?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:20.480
Young, rich, handsome, with a
speedboat... So terribly predictable.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.325
He's your lover?

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.202
Ex-lover.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:29.571
But you still have
some feelings for him?

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:36.453
I don't know.

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.365
It's not good to look back.

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:41.799
No, you're right.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.419
- It can make you feel a bit sick.
- Oh.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:50.850
Shall we head back?

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:53.478
- Well, actually...
- We are going out.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:56.314
- Oh, really? Out?
- Yes, on a date.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:59.025
- Well, not a date. Not...
- Yes, a date.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:01.527
But what about the, er...

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.154
...diamond?

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.398
You can handle that, can't you?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.035
Are you telling me you don't
want to see this through now?

01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:13.414
No, I... Well, I think so. I mean,
can't you deal with it on your own?

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.613
I'll meet you at the
rendezvous in Paris.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.253
Right.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.838
Right, I see. Well...

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:24.884
I suppose I did start all this for a
reason and the reason was for the...

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:27.663
for the people, for...
for Doreen, for...

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.642
Right, I'll be off, then.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:35.762
- You take good care of her.
- I will.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:47.282
So, first of all, we have
some champagne at my villa.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.493
OK. It's a bit early,
isn't it, for champagne?

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.864
It's never too early for champagne.
It's always too late.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.001
Ah!

01:19:58.002 --> 01:20:00.753
Oh, thank goodness. You made it.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.005
Where's Kate?

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:04.590
Ah, she's not here.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.368
Where is she?

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.594
- She's with a Frenchman.
- Oh!

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:12.015
- What Frenchman?
- Jean-Baptiste.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.725
You knew about him?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.102
Oh! Oh, right. Jean-Baptiste, yeah.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.438
Did everybody know about the
Frenchman apart from me?

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:21.024
But why is she meeting him?
You're back together now.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.401
No, Pen, we're not back together.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:26.237
You seemed so happy so we
just went along with it.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:28.573
I suppose it was a bit
of a long shot anyway.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:31.909
Probably wouldn't have
worked second time around.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.995
Exactly.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:37.665
Anyway, the diamond. Where is it?

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.043
- Ah, yeah.
- There's been a slight delay.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:43.539
Yeah, but... Pen's got me
on the old prune juice.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:45.840
Should get the bomb doors open.

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:50.178
Maybe? No, false alarm.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.790
- Where are you going?
- Ah, good morning.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:20.659
There is a robe on the chair.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:31.094
- I'm so sorry about last night.
- Oh, Jean-Baptiste, it was lovely.

01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:34.749
- Yeah, but I drunk too much and...
- It happens. You're young.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:38.017
You've got much more experience
than me. That thing that you did...

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.353
Oh, thank you.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.355
So, what would you
like to do today?

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:44.607
We can have some
breakfast outside or...

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.568
We can take my boat somewhere.
You can practise your French.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:50.976
Ooh.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.741
- You like this song?
- I love this song.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.577
- Who is it?
- Free. You know...

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.955
♪ All right now ♪

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.154
No, I don't know this band.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:05.154
No... of course you don't.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:13.261
It was the linseeds that ultimately
did it, such a smooth transition.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.804
- Well done, Jerry.
- Darling.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:18.141
Amazing. Look at it.
It's beautiful. Touch it.

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.294
No, I think I'll pass, Jerry.

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:22.311
Thank you.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:25.773
Where is this man, Diamond Dave?

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.302
Patience, my dear, patience.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.195
- I'm sure she's coming, Richard.
- Mmm.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.439
I don't think so, Pen.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:36.151
Thanks, anyway.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:40.830
I don't understand. What
is the Eye of the Rainbow?

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:43.666
It's a diamond that we stole.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:49.213
But first we had to kidnap the Texans, scuba
to the chateau and break into a wedding.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:52.163
- You stole a diamond?
- Yes.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.596
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Yes, you will.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:10.568
It's Diamond Dave.
He hasn't changed a bit.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:13.893
- Don't take less than ten.
- Right you are.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.710
- I just don't get it.
- What, my love?

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.921
How you know all these people?

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:32.507
- Who?
- Well, Diamond bloody Dave.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.343
- Oh, you know, way back.
- No, I don't know, Jerry.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.930
I don't know about Saigon or
Guam or the Foreign Legion.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:42.600
- Or even Diamond bloody Dave. I really don't.
- It's all right. Calm down.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.686
No, I won't calm down.
Who are these people, Jerry?

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:50.316
These contacts? All that metal
in your body? This past life?

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:52.818
I thought I knew you.
I thought we were the same.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.313
Oh, Pen.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:01.312
I'm more than the sum of my parts.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:06.366
- What does that mean?
- I've got no idea.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.711
But what I do know
is that I love you.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:15.788
Always have, always will. OK?

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:19.428
- OK.
- Yeah!

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.799
- Got 15.
- Bloody hell.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.320
You can literally go anywhere
from here, can't you?

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:39.190
Well, we've got a
briefcase full of cash.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:41.867
Penelope!

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:44.316
There's one back to
London in 50 minutes.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:49.333
No, I don't think we
should get that one.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:51.532
- Kate!
- Hey-hey!

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.965
Listen, what do you think about...

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:59.745
I don't know, maybe doing a bit of
travelling before we head home?

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.004
Travelling?

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:06.851
- Well...
- Stupid idea, right?

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.720
Yes.

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:14.810
A crazy... daft... stupid...

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:18.029
but brilliant idea.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:19.697
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why the hell not?

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.575
- What have we got to lose?
- Apart from our dignity?

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:24.944
Either way, it's
worth investigating.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:28.357
Definitely. Let's investigate.

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.792
Would you see that the
relevant people get this?

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.044
It would be an honour, my friend.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:36.255
I've, er... taken a bit out. You can
stash the rest under the mattress.

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:39.717
Don't worry, old pal. We've got a
safe house built under the stairs.

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:42.496
- We do?
- Yeah.

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:46.379
<i>Bon voyage</i>, my old friends.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:48.934
- I'll feed the cat.
- Oh, thank you.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.436
- Look after yourselves.
- We will.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:51.646
Thank you.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:54.273
- Come along, Jerry.
- Be very, very naughty.

01:25:54.274 --> 01:25:57.177
- It's is very heavy, Jerry.
- Hey-hey!

01:25:57.736 --> 01:26:00.264
- Come on, my love.
- I say...

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:03.392
Oh... yes.
