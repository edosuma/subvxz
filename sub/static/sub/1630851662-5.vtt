WEBVTT

00:24.774 --> 00:28.069
Big girls need
a healthy breakfast
before kindergarten.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.029
So here's
everybody's favorite...

00:30.113 --> 00:32.824
[chuckles]
A Man-in-the-Moon-Cake!

00:32.907 --> 00:34.909
Down, Brucely.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.119
-[Brucely whines]
-Whoops.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.124
-[Artemis] Who said it?
-[student 1] Victor Hugo,
Professor Crock!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.460
-[student 2] Oh, the bishop!
-[student 3] Myriel said it
to Jean Valjean!

00:43.543 --> 00:45.879
[laughing]

00:47.046 --> 00:48.089
-[grunts]
-[man] Ooh!

00:55.972 --> 01:00.059
[gasps] Dick? Kaldur?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.060
What is it?

01:04.814 --> 01:06.316
Who?

01:06.399 --> 01:07.484
It's Conner...

01:14.491 --> 01:16.576
[theme music playing]

01:55.240 --> 01:57.283
-[clinking]
-[Lian] Whoops.

02:01.454 --> 02:06.209
[students murmuring]

02:11.923 --> 02:12.924
[Tigress grunts]

02:14.384 --> 02:15.343
[man groans]

02:40.994 --> 02:43.288
[hammering]

02:46.958 --> 02:47.917
[Will] There.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.006
It's great.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.888
Sorry. It is great.

03:00.805 --> 03:01.931
But?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.308
But I alternate
between being numb

03:03.391 --> 03:05.476
and barely managing
to hold it together.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.937
I miss Conner.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.230
He was like a brother to me.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.357
And M'gann...

03:11.441 --> 03:14.319
[inhales] I know exactly...

03:14.402 --> 03:16.946
exactly what she's
going through. [sniffles]

03:17.030 --> 03:19.991
And there are some things
you can just never prepare for

03:20.074 --> 03:22.577
and some things
you can never get over.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.953
[breathes deeply]

03:24.037 --> 03:25.830
I better leave
before I start sobbing.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.208
Hey. Nothing wrong
with sobbing.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.419
Yeah.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.338
Ah, well, it upsets Brucely.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.173
[snoring]

03:43.640 --> 03:45.433
[groans]

03:46.225 --> 03:47.560
[gasps]

03:47.644 --> 03:50.313
[Lawrence] Now that's how
you do it, little girl.

03:50.396 --> 03:54.442
Your opponent makes a mistake,
you take full advantage.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.693
No mercy.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.029
But you,

03:58.112 --> 04:01.658
In the field, a mistake
like that'll get you killed.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.117
Learn or die, baby girl.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.162
[exhales] It's hard to see
out of this mask.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.790
You need that mask,
the way you fight.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.792
It's too damn big
for her, Crusher.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.753
How's she supposed to succeed
wearing your hand-me-downs?

04:13.836 --> 04:16.965
You wouldn't go out
in gear that didn't fit,
so why force her to--

04:17.048 --> 04:18.716
[groans]

04:18.800 --> 04:21.052
Worry about your own ass, Jade.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.439
[Artemis] I know
the formula, Mom.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
I know what works for me,

04:35.483 --> 04:36.901
what helps me
through the grief.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.612
Hitting criminals over the head
with a bo staff?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.031
[sighs] Helping other people.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.992
That's how I survived
losing Wally,

04:44.075 --> 04:46.452
and-and that's how
I will survive this.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.789
Okay, whatever gets you
out of bed.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.457
But helping strangers

04:51.541 --> 04:54.210
also gave me the excuse
to take a pass

04:54.293 --> 04:57.714
on helping the one person
I thought was beyond my help.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.549
-Wally?
-No! Jade!

05:00.341 --> 05:02.301
[sighs] Artemis.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.637
Jade is beyond your help.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.848
Beyond all our help.

05:06.931 --> 05:10.310
She had everything here
and threw it all away.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.602
Maybe.

05:11.686 --> 05:15.273
I don't care.
All I know is I need to try.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.567
There's only one problem.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.653
[inhales] Finding her.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.822
That won't be
your only problem.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.491
Mom...

05:26.743 --> 05:28.494
<i>Do you know where Jade is?</i>

05:54.896 --> 05:56.064
When Will gets home,

05:56.147 --> 05:57.565
tell him I'll be
at University Library

05:57.648 --> 05:58.608
[Paula] Okay.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.870
[engine starting]

06:24.634 --> 06:26.844
[sobbing]

06:57.834 --> 06:59.210
-Evening, Professor!
-Hey Ms. Crock!

06:59.293 --> 07:00.419
Mm, 'night.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.613
[grunting]

07:29.282 --> 07:31.367
-[sword swishes]
-[Onyx] Big mistake.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.369
[Arrowette] Well,
someone made one.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.329
Drop your weapons.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.248
[Onyx] You're not
taking me back.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.208
Uh, not sure where "back" is,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.669
but I'm not opposed
to taking you there.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.254
You're sure not wanted here.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.839
[Onyx] No one asked you.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.759
Watch it!

07:53.139 --> 07:54.807
[creaking]

07:54.891 --> 07:57.727
-[grunts] We may need
to take her more seriously.
-Noted.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.811
[swishing]

07:58.895 --> 08:00.605
[Onyx grunting]

08:06.152 --> 08:09.822
-[electricity crackling]
-[groaning]

08:13.159 --> 08:15.453
[Onyx groans]

08:15.536 --> 08:19.081
You followed me from my home.
My home!

08:19.165 --> 08:20.833
You broke the rules.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.460
[groans]

08:22.543 --> 08:25.004
Makes me want
to break some rules, too.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.511
Cheshire...

08:32.595 --> 08:33.930
[Cheshire yells]

08:34.013 --> 08:36.349
[swishing]

08:36.432 --> 08:39.018
[groans]

08:39.101 --> 08:39.936
[grunts]

08:48.194 --> 08:49.153
[groans]

08:53.282 --> 08:54.742
What are you waiting for?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.745
If you're going to finish it,
finish it.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.706
Spill.

09:00.790 --> 09:05.002
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to,
um, frighten you?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.421
-Oh, like you could ever--
-Let her talk.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.382
I-I wasn't following you
to attack,

09:09.465 --> 09:12.760
and I thought these two
were working for the Shadows.

09:12.843 --> 09:16.138
My name is Onyx. Onyx Adams.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.390
And I need your help.

09:17.473 --> 09:20.017
Plus, I have help
to offer in exchange.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.352
What kind of help?

09:21.435 --> 09:23.688
I've defected from
the League of Shadows.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.356
Specifically to warn you.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.483
-Look, can I stand up?
-No.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.360
But I'm listening.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.445
Okay, fine.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.989
[exhales]

09:33.072 --> 09:34.907
Cassandra Savage
is on her way here.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.200
She'll claim she defected

09:36.284 --> 09:37.994
and she'll pretend
to need your help,

09:38.077 --> 09:40.871
but her true intent
is to become a mole
on your team.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.331
I think I've heard
this one already.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.250
[scoffs] About Red Arrow?
Or Terra?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.419
About Onyx,
like two seconds ago.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.087
So you want us to believe

09:48.170 --> 09:50.631
that Vandal Savage's daughter
would believe

09:50.715 --> 09:52.174
that we would believe

09:52.258 --> 09:55.303
that she'd ever in 50,000 years
betray her father?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.346
[scoffs] Hell would have
to freeze over.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.265
[Cassandra] Well,
as a matter of fact...

09:59.348 --> 10:00.558
[whirring]

10:00.641 --> 10:03.185
...you might want
to break out your mittens.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.980
I'll only need the one, thanks.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.194
Why have you come, girl?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.155
I know the Shadows have had
a contract on me

10:14.238 --> 10:16.532
ever since I betrayed them
to save Red Arrow.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.951
That is a truth, certainly,

10:19.035 --> 10:21.412
but hardly one
that answers my question.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.749
I've come to end the conflict
once and for all...

10:24.832 --> 10:27.209
by ending you-- [gasps]

10:27.293 --> 10:30.963
Please. You must be aware
that we are no longer

10:31.047 --> 10:33.549
in the business
of Shadows here.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.302
Or Light, for that matter.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.678
The Master has declared

10:37.762 --> 10:41.057
that the world is full
of shades of grey.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.726
Once a Shadow, always a Shadow.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.644
You taught me that, Sensei.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.065
I taught you many things,
Jade Nguyen.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.900
Foolishness is not one of them.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.277
This isn't the act of a fool.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.905
Something quite different
is at play.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.156
Cheshire may pretend

10:57.239 --> 10:59.325
she is here to brave us
in our home,

10:59.408 --> 11:03.996
but truthfully, she came
because she is afraid.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.958
So this is true?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.418
You've "defected"?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.796
Yes. And I'm asking
for your protection.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.632
[groans] I told you
that's what she'd say!

11:14.715 --> 11:16.008
But I swear she's lying.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.094
I overheard her
plotting with Lady Shiva.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.261
That is why I came!

11:19.345 --> 11:20.721
That's the lie.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.099
After I escaped, the Shadows
must have sent Onyx

11:23.182 --> 11:25.309
to sabotage
my reception with you.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.270
But if you turn me away,
you're signing
my death warrant.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.358
Our intel is that you're loyal
to your father, fiercely loyal.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.651
I was.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.112
Until my father
killed my sister Olympia

11:36.195 --> 11:38.364
right in front of my eyes.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.533
It's been eating me up inside.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.576
Eventually, I-I realized
I couldn't stay.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.372
Oh, tell me
you're not buying this.

11:46.455 --> 11:50.709
I tried to escape
once before and failed.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.294
I thought he'd kill me,

11:52.378 --> 11:54.630
but Vandal Savage
doesn't believe

11:54.713 --> 11:57.133
in wasting a potential asset.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.678
So instead, he did this
to teach me a lesson.

12:00.761 --> 12:04.473
He gave me a choice between
the Shadows and death.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.142
So I went back to Santa Prisca

12:06.225 --> 12:09.478
where Deathstroke and Shiva
watched my every move.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
I had to bide my time
before I could escape again.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.816
There was no
"first escape attempt"!

12:13.899 --> 12:16.986
She lost that arm
on a failed mission
to recruit Killer Croc.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.654
-You witnessed that?
-No, but--

12:18.737 --> 12:21.615
Once a Shadow, always a Shadow.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.451
Or so I've heard.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.495
Neither of your stories
is particularly convincing.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.456
But shouldn't we give them
the benefit of the doubt?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.082
I mean, how can we be sure?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.292
I dunno.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.961
We may some need help
working this out.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.174
I assume you have
a good therapist

12:38.257 --> 12:40.301
lined up for your son.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.844
He will not need one.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.429
Unlike your daughter,

12:43.512 --> 12:45.264
he will have grown up
with his mother.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.600
I did what was best
for my girl.

12:47.683 --> 12:51.353
What is best for my boy
is to be by my side.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.522
I will never give Damian up.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.108
Then you're a selfish fool.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.402
And you are a coward.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.154
[phone vibrating]

13:05.951 --> 13:07.036
Cheshire...

13:07.119 --> 13:09.288
-[grunts]
-...you came here to die.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.373
Come back
when you are ready to live.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.757
Please, please don't go!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.091
Sorry, sis,

13:21.175 --> 13:22.718
mom's not getting out
of prison any time soon,

13:22.801 --> 13:25.554
and I refuse to live
in this house with just Dad.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.015
Dad and you and me!

13:28.098 --> 13:30.935
We have to keep this family
from falling apart.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.399
Toothbrush, duh!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.984
Knew I was
forgetting something.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.031
Dad'll come after you...

13:46.075 --> 13:49.578
Let him. I'll disappear,
like the Cheshire Cat.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.710
You should get out, too.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.047
I'd let ya come with me,
but you'd slow me down.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.425
Someone has to be here
when Mom gets out.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.970
Haven't you learned anything?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.806
In this family,
it's every girl for herself.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.739
Is this really the best place
to bring these two?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.741
We don't have a lot of options.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.118
Can't take 'em
to the Watchtower

14:29.201 --> 14:30.619
or the Premiere Building.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.122
I checked with Ollie,
and he gave his blessing.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.832
If the Vault
winds up compromised,

14:34.915 --> 14:36.792
it's no huge loss.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.795
He did say to keep you away
from the rocket launchers.

-[Will] No, honest, he did.
-[Roy] Okay!

14:45.217 --> 14:47.177
[Cassandra] I know
you're Sportsmaster's daughter.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.221
You should understand
my position.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.199
Thank you.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.289
I go through more SUVs
with you people--

17:20.372 --> 17:21.623
Ignoring you now.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.587
[choking, groans]

17:30.758 --> 17:34.803
So, basically, both of you
could have freed yourselves
at any time.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.263
-Basically.
-Of course.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.473
And escaped, too.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.932
-Basically.
-Of course.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.731
[sirens approaching]

17:45.814 --> 17:48.192
Those Shadows were after me,
not Onyx.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.110
It should be obvious now
she's lying.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.071
They attacked Savage
to make her story
seem truthful.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.073
But she's obviously lying.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.366
[door buzzes]

17:58.035 --> 18:01.205
[computer]<i> Temporary Cells</i>
<i>A and B secured.</i>

18:01.288 --> 18:04.541
Terra, you knew them both
when you were a Shadow.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.126
What do you think?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.669
Onyx had talent.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.006
But she wasn't bloodthirsty
enough for Slade's tastes.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.008
He never thought
she'd make the cut.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.844
Which would explain
why she might run.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.680
But Cassandra was always
a true believer.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.641
She worshipped her father.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.768
Hard to believe she'd ever
betray him,

18:22.851 --> 18:24.520
the Light or the Shadows.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.356
In that world,
she'd be quite the scandal.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.066
Um, yeah, no.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.026
[Spoiler] If I learned
anything from Cluemaster,

18:31.109 --> 18:32.986
it's that no matter
how hard it is to admit

18:33.070 --> 18:35.364
your dear-old-dad's
one of the bad guys,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.699
sooner or later,
you have to walk away.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.117
You know
what I'm talking about.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.702
[Will] Some walk away.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.121
But some definitely follow
in dear-old-dad's footsteps.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.456
Icicle, Jr.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.416
Cheshire.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.460
Yes, what is that expression?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.213
The falling apple
does not bounce far
from one's head.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.590
I think you're conflating
genetics with gravity.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.883
But, yeah.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.636
As the tree is bent,
so grows the twig.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.429
Sometimes the apple
doesn't even fall.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.515
It just sits on the branch
and turns rotten.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.642
Are we still talking about
Cassandra and Onyx?

19:03.725 --> 19:07.020
Cause all this apple stuff
has made me very confused
and kinda hungry.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.189
Orphan, you were a Shadow, too.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.566
Should we trust Cassandra?

19:14.486 --> 19:15.654
Onyx?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
[Will sighs]
They could both be moles.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.368
And he's a former mole,
so he'd know. Ow!

19:21.451 --> 19:23.412
It's an old Cold War strategy:

19:23.495 --> 19:25.080
the bad guys
send us two options,

19:25.163 --> 19:26.999
and don't really care
which one we trust.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.418
But wait, if they're both
equally untrustworthy,

19:29.501 --> 19:31.795
doesn't that make them both
equally trustworthy?

19:31.879 --> 19:34.423
[Spoiler] True.
Both could be legit,

19:34.506 --> 19:36.592
but the Shadows got them
to mistrust each other.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.843
Geez, kick 'em both loose

19:37.926 --> 19:39.469
and let the Shadows
sort 'em out.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.430
No. If there's even a chance

19:41.513 --> 19:44.182
one of them or both
is telling the truth,

19:44.266 --> 19:46.935
we have to protect her or them.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.271
[sighs] You get the idea.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.357
Everyone deserves a chance
at redemption.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.870
Where's your sister?

20:04.953 --> 20:07.247
Gone. For real.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.624
You'll never find her.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.250
Why would I look for her?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.502
She'll be lucky
if she survives a week.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.798
But if she thinks she's ready
to be out on her own, fine.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.635
Now, let's get you ready.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.054
Ditch the books, baby girl.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.972
Time to train.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.654
[swishing]

20:38.737 --> 20:41.823
I suggest you find
another seat, yeah?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.116
[exclaims]

21:02.427 --> 21:03.929
[breathes deeply]

21:07.891 --> 21:09.643
-What's wrong with Lian?
-Jade?

21:09.726 --> 21:11.853
You signaled me.
What's wrong with Lian?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.689
N-N-Nothing.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.651
I mean, sh-she asks about you
all the time,

21:17.734 --> 21:19.486
but Lian's fine.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.279
She's upstairs, asleep.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.198
Then why did you call me?

21:23.281 --> 21:24.324
I didn't.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.118
