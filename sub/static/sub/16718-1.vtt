WEBVTT

00:17.280 --> 00:20.440
Dr.  Leighton, the lifeguard
is on the radio for you.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.000
Put me through.
What do we have here?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.520
The shark shot up like a rocket.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.280
There are three victims,
one of whom is already dead.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.400
These are teenagers, man.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.040
-How far are you?
-Three minutes.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.440
Better hurry up, the whole
beach is covered in blood.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.560
Breaking news.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.360
A shark attack is reported
in Malibu earlier this morning.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.480
You are watching an amateur video...

00:35.600 --> 00:36.560
SHARK ATTACK IN MALIBU

00:36.680 --> 00:38.200
... from the dramatic
scenes on the beach.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.480
One of our reporters
will be on site shortly

00:40.600 --> 00:42.400
and bring you up to
date during the day.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.760
Hello, interns.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.720
I'm Jesse Sallander, the
emergency room chief nurse.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.160
And for the next three
years I'll be your mom.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.880
I can promise you,
nothing is going on

00:58.040 --> 00:59.440
here that your mom
doesn't know about.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.480
You think you are
smarter than your mom

01:01.600 --> 01:03.880
because you are
doctors, but you are not.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.200
Your mama can
tell when you're lying

01:06.400 --> 01:07.640
cries or dies.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.320
Hey, watch out, dude.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.560
It can't stand around here.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.440
Transport couches come in

01:12.560 --> 01:13.520
and out here, every two minutes.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.320
Storage room.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.640
CCCRP?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.240
Combat Casualty Care
Research Program.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.360
Ministry of Defense.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.200
Every year they send us

01:22.320 --> 01:23.440
doctors to show
us new techniques

01:23.560 --> 01:26.040
new technologies
they learned in combat.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.000
That was only a year ago for us.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.080
It feels like a thousand

01:32.120 --> 01:35.440
Every year, thousands
want new doctors like you

01:35.560 --> 01:37.440
Learn emergency
medicine, here in the parish

01:37.560 --> 01:41.080
cathedral, which you
are about to enter.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.960
That is her.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.560
This is Jessamine.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.800
I thought that
was Charlotte Piel.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.920
Jessamine was the
character she played.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.000
Why don't you know something like that?

01:49.160 --> 01:50.120
I don't know any of their films.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.200
You haven't seen
The Artemis Stone?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.960
That was the most influential
movie of my childhood.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.320
The Artemis Fire was the best.
I read the book twice.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.640
The Artemis Thief
was much better.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.920
-You are crazy.
-You're nerds.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.600
Angels Memorial.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.640
Okay, look closely guys.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.400
This is what you will
look like in 12 months.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.400
Tired and insecure.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.480
You sophomores say hello to
those in your sophomore year.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.280
Hi, Miss Piel.
I am Angus Leighton.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.880
I'm a huge fan.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Just call me Charlotte.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.440
No, it's called Dr.  Piel.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.160
I am Malaya Pineda.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.160
-Hi.
-And this is Mario Savetti.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.600
He hasn't seen
any of your films.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.120
It's enough.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.760
Dr.  Leighton, did you come
with your brother today?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.640
-He's got new interns.
-Yes.  I haven't seen him since.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.960
Dr.  Leighton is in the helicopter.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.440
What, is he in the helicopter?

02:34.560 --> 02:36.800
Him and that guy from the Army.
There wasn't enough space because...

02:36.920 --> 02:38.280
Does Dr.  Rorish of it?

02:38.400 --> 02:39.360
What kind of army guy?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.560
Man, I hate helicopters.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.040
It's a miracle that if you
think about it, you even fly.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.160
I do not have it yet...

02:46.560 --> 02:47.520
thought about it.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.280
Yes.  They crash 35%
more often than planes.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.200
9.84 crashes every
100,000 hours.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.720
I did not know that.  Now.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.040
If you're so scared, why
did you hop on board?

03:01.160 --> 03:03.040
I wasn't talking about
fear, I just don't like it.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.400
I don't like bad
tequila either, but

03:05.520 --> 03:06.920
that didn't stop me
yesterday either.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.480
A strong wind is
blowing from the west.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.040
I'll have to land
against the wind.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.680
Well, that's going to be bad now!
Just the rest.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.760
Or?  It's a miracle that it doesn't
fall from the sky like a stone.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.440
Ground contact in eight seconds.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.840
This beach has been closed
by order of the county sheriff.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.560
Take over the girl.
I take the other one.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.640
Understood.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.240
What's your name?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.320
Kaya.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.200
The shark came out of nowhere!
We didn't see him until...

03:52.480 --> 03:53.440
Well what is your name

03:53.560 --> 03:55.000
My name is jaydin.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.840
Jaydin, please calm down now.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.240
OK.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.840
He's losing too much blood.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.440
He won't make it unless
we stabilize him here.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.840
You have to hold still.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.840
She has to get on the stretcher
and then in the helicopter.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.280
-What about Tucker?
-No idea...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.920
Good!  I go!

04:18.360 --> 04:19.800
Stay behind the police line.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.880
Take them away, have
someone take them away.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.200
-What do we have here?
-The guy's goulash.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.640
I need to transfuse
blood while I plug this in.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.200
Connect what?  So what is that?

04:29.320 --> 04:32.080
Bandaging does not work, but
the bleeding must be stopped.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.560
That is why this foam is
injected into the peritoneum.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.400
-Foam?
-He covers everything

04:36.560 --> 04:38.160
the organs, vessels, to everything...

04:38.320 --> 04:39.840
It expands and
tampons the bleeding.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.840
This is called the
intraperitoneal foam system.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.040
With best regards
from the US military.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.920
Are you serious?
Have you done that before?

04:45.720 --> 04:46.680
With a pig.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.200
-A pig?
-It works.

04:50.000 --> 04:50.960
Should work.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.960
Here.  It's like injecting
cream into an eclair.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.960
The blood circulation gets
better, the pulse stronger.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.200
Let's get her out of here.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.240
As you know, the
Army sends one...

05:09.360 --> 05:12.720
To teach, not to send
my teaching doctor out

05:12.840 --> 05:14.440
into the field on the
day his interns start.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.800
This is hardly a home visit.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.400
-You don't have authority...
-I do.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.800
I was told you were
informed on Friday.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.960
What are we talking about now?

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
The board decided to combine

05:28.200 --> 05:29.960
emergency room
management and trauma 1.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.480
-I beg your pardon?
-Yes.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.120
I am now in charge of both areas.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.040
You can't be serious.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.240
I'm sorry you found out.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.360
I know you are disappointed.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.960
Losing a job that I didn't want?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.040
No, I'm pissed off about the

05:43.200 --> 05:45.080
merger of Trauma
1 with another area

05:45.200 --> 05:47.080
sets the emergency
room back by 40 years.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.120
Just that it's more effective.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.840
More effective for you.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.560
What is happening with me?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.400
You will be a doctor again.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.840
I've always been a doctor.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.840
Grab the door.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.000
Close the door.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.680
Man overboard!

06:17.880 --> 06:19.320
Put on!  We lost a man!

06:24.920 --> 06:26.520
You have to turn around and back.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.880
I have a ramp in the back.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.640
I can't sit up.
Not with the wind!

06:32.200 --> 06:33.440
Fly right over the water.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.360
-What are you doing?
-Something stupid.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.720
Make them an angel!

06:52.920 --> 06:54.200
All right, watch out, guys.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.560
They are doctors.
You are here to learn.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.160
You're out of the
way, you're not a guest.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.800
You are part of the
trauma team, don't be shy.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.840
Well, let's get started,
heads down, careful.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.200
Lady, open the door.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.600
-What do you have here?
-Two shark victims.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.400
A thirteen year
old with multiple

07:16.520 --> 07:18.040
deep wounds on
her right leg and arm.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.040
- A seventeen year old...
- One, two, three.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.640
... with multiple stab
wounds in the abdomen,

07:21.760 --> 07:23.840
he had low blood
pressure, now he's stable.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.600
Well, just a moment.  Pinkney, get
him to the operating room right now.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.360
Moment.
Where are the two doctors?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.440
There was an accident.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.520
Which accident?

07:32.960 --> 07:34.160
Dr.  Leighton fell.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.680
- Fell from where?
- From the helicopter.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.760
From a height of six meters.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.160
-Where are you now?
-No idea.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.160
Army guy Willis is with
him, that's all I know.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.320
Angus, stay here.
Go to the control center.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.040
Find out what
about your brother.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.000
Transport stretcher, watch out.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.560
Michelle, a blood count,
blood group and cross test.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.640
Take over.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.920
Good, get her over here.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.440
Come here.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.080
On three.  One two Three.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.200
I have it.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.320
-What's your name?
-Kaya.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.760
Kaya, all right.  We'll roll you
around once, everything will be fine.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.160
Ready?  One two...

08:04.280 --> 08:05.240
All right.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.680
-Step away.
-All right.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.880
The airways are clear.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.600
Who can tell me the best
place for IV for trauma patients?

08:11.840 --> 08:12.920
Behind you, behind you.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.000
Anybody?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.840
I need a cart with 5-0
vicryl sewing material.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.200
Breathing sounds
evenly on both sides.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.360
Femoral vein?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.600
No.  Hurry, your patient
can't wait for google.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.400
Blood pressure is at 82 over 40.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.240
The belly is soft
and insensitive.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.040
Jesse, Epi with lidocaine, please.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.440
-Right away.
-Thank you.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.080
Tweezers, please.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.840
Tweezers, thank you.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.960
Dr.  Kean, where
is the access going?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.280
Come.  Now please.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.640
-The inner jugular vein?
-No.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.320
The pupils are uniform
and sensitive to light.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.480
The elbow veins allow great

08:41.600 --> 08:42.960
access for immediate
resuscitation.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.600
Well done.  Look here.
Come on and look down.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.600
Here is a 2 cm tear
in the tibial artery.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.360
Come on, Dr.  Piel.
Help me fix it, please.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.080
A sixteen in the
crook of the elbow?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.160
Yes, please.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.240
Jesse.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.960
Mike Leighton fell 6
meters from the helicopter.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.160
Call Dr.  Campbell,
I'm doing a trial

09:03.320 --> 09:04.600
laparotomy, add 2
more units of 0 negative.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.440
Incredible that
this boy is still alive.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.520
What the hell is that stuff?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.720
All right, call Colonel Willis.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.040
It looks like an eclair.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.720
Did you want to
tell me what that

09:20.880 --> 09:21.840
stuff is that oozes
out of the patient?

09:21.960 --> 09:23.520
I've been a bit busy here.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.960
GCS is 6, I'll intubate.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
It adapts to the anatomy.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.360
That's what it's about.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.200
I need a 10cc syringe

09:29.400 --> 09:32.320
a 7.5 endotracheal tube,
and is there a CO2 detector?

09:32.960 --> 09:34.680
How am I supposed
to get that out of him?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It is designed to
deviate from the organs

09:37.120 --> 09:38.400
without leaving any
surface damage.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.080
You become famous.  It has
never been tried on humans.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.800
Does anyone know where the bleeding is?

09:44.640 --> 09:45.600
Well, we're in.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.200
Probably a mesenteric

09:47.320 --> 09:48.560
root injury, hard to tell.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.520
Is there a status
report on Dr.  Leighton?

09:51.680 --> 09:52.640
Who's there?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.160
Angus, you shouldn't
be on the line.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.520
I go out when I know
how my brother is doing.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.640
Is he conscious?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.360
No, and that doesn't help.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.040
When are you around here?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.120
Angus, get out of there.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.640
Dr.  Leighton, get away
from the microphone.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.440
Boy, let them do their job.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.360
An ambulance
just arrived, help me

10:10.080 --> 10:11.400
or do you need a break?

10:12.960 --> 10:13.920
I'm good.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.840
Okay what's up

10:21.000 --> 10:22.680
Sixty-five year old
Henry Underwood found

10:22.800 --> 10:24.720
unconscious on the
sidewalk after being robbed.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.800
GCS is at 4, he only
responds to pain.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.000
Multiple bruises.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.880
Blood pressure is at 118 to 64,
pulse is at 132, saturation is 87.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.840
Get out of the way, bed number two.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.520
If we take blood from him,
give him 1 liter of saline solution.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.200
On three.  One two Three.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.360
What do you have, Guthrie?

10:42.520 --> 10:45.040
Ambush victim.  Blunt trauma
to the head, back and chest.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.840
-Get the ultrasound machine.
-I?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.040
-Where is it?
-I have it.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.200
You.  What's your name boy

10:52.320 --> 10:53.280
Elliot.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.640
Here you are Dr.  Dixon.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.960
Breathe, Dr.  Dixon.  Breathe.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.640
Interns,

10:59.720 --> 11:00.680
i am dr  Campbell.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.480
Since your teaching
doctor is currently

11:04.600 --> 11:07.160
incapacitated, Dr.
Rorish looks after.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.400
I have to go up to the operating room.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.840
We don't know if he's out of
action.  We don't know anything.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.640
Dr.  Leighton, sorry.
I have not seen her.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.880
Since when has he been
giving instructions to the interns?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.640
-Dr.  Leighton.
-He runs the operating room.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.320
Dr.  Campbell is the new
emergency room manager.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.480
We all hope Mike is fine.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.440
LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPARTMENT

11:33.360 --> 11:34.320
Oh God.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.360
I'm new here.  I am willis.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.040
-Where are we taking him?
-To the Center Stage!

11:40.280 --> 11:41.480
There they come.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.160
-All right.
-Angus, this is Mike.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.880
Was he even conscious?

11:50.520 --> 11:51.760
-Malaya?
-I dont know.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.280
Unfortunately not.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.880
No gag reflex, no reaction.
I had to intubate him.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.160
He has increased intracranial
pressure, he is bleeding.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.360
-I call neurosurgery.
-There is no time for that.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.720
He cramps.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.800
He has a brain prolapse.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.080
I know what cramp means.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.120
Then you know your
brother will die in the

12:08.240 --> 12:09.400
next 60 seconds
without drilling his head.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.120
No, we are waiting
for neurosurgery.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.160
-Risa, the trephine wagon.
-I can use some help.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.360
Malaya, swap with me.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.880
Dr.  Rorish, this is my brother!

12:18.000 --> 12:19.560
Therefore, you shouldn't
make the decision.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.560
-I don't even know him!
-You need to know one thing.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.960
I did about 300 of them
and you probably didn't.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.200
I am the best hope for
your brother.  Now you go.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.000
Angus, let him do
what he has to do.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.960
-You shouldn't see this.
-I can not go.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.760
I'm not forcing you
to go, but stay back.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.840
I drill.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.240
Mike will succeed.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.280
That guy, Colonel Willis...

13:02.640 --> 13:04.320
drills a hole in his skull

13:04.600 --> 13:06.920
on the center stage and
he didn't care what I thought.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.320
It didn't matter to anyone.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.880
Even Rorish.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.960
I know you don't wanna hear this

13:15.520 --> 13:18.320
but to me it looked like
he had saved his life.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.720
I have no news
except that he is alive.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.480
OK.  When does he wake up?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.040
We'll leave it sedated
and open for at least

13:31.160 --> 13:32.120
a few days until the
swelling goes away.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.840
We should have brought
him up here immediately.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.120
Mike would be dead if it
wasn't for Willis.  It is a fact.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.560
I already said that.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.640
Where's tucker

13:47.920 --> 13:48.880
He's in the operating room.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.560
His parents are on the
plane, we couldn't reach them.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.880
I know.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.480
Our parents are
in Paris together.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.920
Nice.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.800
Is my sister here yet?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.200
It's a long drive from Malibu.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.600
What I also had to
experience today.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.120
-First, he and I were a couple.
-OK.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.000
He's older, but we've
got something going.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.160
What kind of...

14:10.560 --> 14:12.240
Oh, just don't answer.
I do not want to know.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.440
It's real, and Jaydin
wants to break us apart.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.280
She is a whore.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.760
- Can't you stun that?
-All right.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.920
That will poke a bit now.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.200
She even let him
reach under the shirt.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.640
How am I supposed to keep up?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.440
-My breasts are...
-OK.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.920
That's a strange
topic right now.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.360
You should have this
conversation with your parents.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.440
Did you talk to them

14:35.760 --> 14:36.880
Before their departure.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.160
You are very upset.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.920
Wait till you tell
about you and Tucker.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.800
Every hospital has
a different system.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.920
Code Green is
relatively calm in Angels.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.080
At Code Yellow it is
full, but still manageable.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.440
Dr.  Dixon, are you lost?

14:50.800 --> 14:51.760
Yes.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.200
At Code Red, we're
overburdened and things get tricky.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.800
But if the board
says Code Black,

14:56.920 --> 14:58.640
then things really
get down to business.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.680
What does that mean?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
It is an internal
disaster in which we

15:02.360 --> 15:05.160
have so many critical
patients that we do

15:05.280 --> 15:06.520
There is a lack of
treatment resources.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.920
How often does this happen?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.120
Almost every night.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.120
If you know you always have

15:12.240 --> 15:13.320
Code Black, why don't you mind?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.240
Because it costs money
and we're a county hospital

15:15.360 --> 15:17.800
in the second largest
city in the United States.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.880
What do you do as a doctor
when there is no capacity?

15:22.400 --> 15:23.360
One transcends one's own.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.600
Troubled enough for today.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.880
Is there a lounge or something
where we can take a break?

15:30.120 --> 15:31.680
Are you tired, Sugar Bear?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.600
No, but that's been
six hours now...

15:33.720 --> 15:35.240
-Age...
-No, I...

15:35.960 --> 15:37.640
-I thought...
-Dr.  Savetti.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.000
Dr.  Kean and Dr.  Piel
should make themselves useful.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.800
I bring Dr.  Dixon
to the lounge, okay?

15:44.880 --> 15:45.840
To the lounge?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.880
Colonel Willis, may I
speak to you for a moment?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.760
Please don't say "Colonel".

15:54.040 --> 15:56.160
It sounds like you're talking to
an old man in a nursing home.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.920
All right, Dr.  Willis.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.760
The way it works here is
that the doctor who treats

15:59.880 --> 16:01.480
the patient first also
becomes the treating doctor.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.600
Or we do it like this,
whoever finds it keeps it.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.280
I scraped her off the beach.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.640
Sorry my mistake.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.560
But the peeling with a
multi-layer seam is missing.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.080
I know that, that's why
she's waiting for her surgery.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.880
In doing so, she can lose
the mobility of her hand.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.840
-Have a look.
-Thank you.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.120
What's happening?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.080
You have a small tear
in your brachioradialis.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.640
Sounds like a dinosaur.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.840
I've never thought of that before.
I find it good.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.640
This is the tendon
that is in control of...

16:37.160 --> 16:38.640
She's passed out.  Kaya?

16:39.640 --> 16:41.160
Blood loss.
Give a couple of units.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.720
The pulse is still strong.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.080
We have to do it here.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.720
Do you want to do it here?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.960
I did this in the back of
the Humvee.  Will you help?

16:48.920 --> 16:49.880
It starts.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.880
You both can do this together.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.960
This is easy.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.800
The patient is in
pain everywhere.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.960
And should that be easy?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.560
Pain everywhere does
not mean pain anywhere.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.640
Examine first, then report.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.760
I am dr  Piel.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.760
I am dr  Kean.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.119
Are you researching for a role?

17:08.240 --> 17:09.960
No, I don't play anymore.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.520
This is... really strange.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.200
They sure are very good, but...

17:14.400 --> 17:15.599
When did the pain start?

17:16.040 --> 17:18.520
I had a hysterectomy six weeks

17:18.680 --> 17:20.280
ago and just got
back to having sex.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.640
-There was one in Runyon Canyon.
- Take a breathe.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.000
And I decided he was the one

17:29.840 --> 17:31.360
and shortly thereafter
the pain started.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.040
Did you have a
fever or bleeding?

17:34.040 --> 17:35.000
No.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.840
Feel that.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.400
That's crepitation, isn't it?

17:40.480 --> 17:42.080
I don't know, I...

17:42.240 --> 17:43.200
What's this?

17:43.360 --> 17:45.560
Crepitations are free
air under the skin.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.200
What does that mean?

17:48.480 --> 17:51.560
If that's what I don't
know, it can mean a lot.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.840
Sorry, but now I want
to see a real doctor.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.960
We are doctors.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.280
Real doctors.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.720
Ms. Kobling, possibly
premature sex after the operation

18:02.000 --> 18:03.400
-Air enters your body.
-What?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.920
Stop... no.
Can we talk for a minute?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.600
Maybe there is a
tear in the vagina.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.160
A crack?  So a hole?

18:10.560 --> 18:11.840
Really, can we talk outside?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.560
I'll be right back.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.720
Oh my God.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.960
Jessamine just told me
there was a hole in my vagina.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.400
Are you suddenly a gynecologist?

18:21.640 --> 18:24.200
Heavy sex can definitely
get air under your

18:24.320 --> 18:26.400
skin, especially soon
after a hysterectomy.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.760
Only sex with a toilet
bowl would do that.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.840
And it's not crepitation.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.720
-If you have a lung puncture...
-That’s different.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.880
There is a lot of
real air in a lung.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.160
In a vagina even if
the sex was violent...

18:36.280 --> 18:37.920
Have you ever had heavy sex?
Me, yes.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.000
I'm sure.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.520
Ouch.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.800
A penis, no matter how
impressive, never pumps so

18:42.960 --> 18:45.200
much air in that it
causes breast crepitations.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.800
What the hell is going on in here?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.760
She thinks Debbie's pain is from

18:48.880 --> 18:50.040
subcutaneous air
from vaginal puncture...

18:50.920 --> 18:52.600
A vaginal puncture?
What is that about?

18:52.840 --> 18:53.800
Hard sex.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.880
It doesn't affect me like that.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.440
Is that the official diagnosis?

18:56.600 --> 18:57.720
I've already examined them.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.960
I did not feel crepitation.
Sex doesn't create that much air.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.600
A CT will bring us clarity.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.560
The newcomers are not allowed to
request expensive tests on suspicion.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.800
What she needs
is a psychologist.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.000
Psychologist?

19:09.120 --> 19:11.880
Yes, she lost her womb.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.960
It's traumatic for a woman.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.240
She is exhausted,
anxious, she has body pain.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.480
It's a depression.
I've seen that many times.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.800
Call a therapist.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.600
Can I help you?

19:34.720 --> 19:37.480
I was called about my
father, Henry Underwood.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.400
I don't have to see him.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.200
I just need to know he's fine.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.480
Don't you want to see him?

19:42.760 --> 19:44.320
Yes, we would like to see him.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.680
I call the doctor.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.160
-Congratulate.
-Thank you.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.160
Your father is right over there.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.200
Henry.  How do you feel?

20:00.320 --> 20:03.080
You should have seen
the other.  No scratch.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.520
I'm sorry, Randall.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.520
You didn't want to
spend this day like that.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.680
I don't want to spend
other days like this, Dad.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.480
Randall, you promised.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.480
I'm sorry.  I can only
give you a few minutes.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.760
He really needs to rest.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.360
It's not what you think

20:17.280 --> 20:18.240
I was robbed.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.560
Two guys came out of nowhere.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.840
I wanted to go to your wedding.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.520
You didn't appear
on a single thing.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.640
Now am I supposed to think you
wanted to come to the wedding?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.840
You were more likely to have
lost a bet and had no money for it.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.200
No.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.560
No, it wasn't like that.
There was no bet.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.000
There was no game either.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.160
When do you finally realize

20:38.280 --> 20:39.920
-that there is no new chance...
-Randall.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.720
-That's it.
-Good, let's go.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.960
-OK?
-Yes she is right.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.040
It's time to leave.  Come on.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.160
-I am sorry.
-Let's go.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.840
-I am so sorry.
-You always feel sorry for everything.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.240
Stop doing that.
You worry your wife.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.440
She is not my wife.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.120
That's what it's about for me.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.760
He did this to me
on my wedding day.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.320
No no.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.760
-On my wedding day.
-Randall.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.840
Take it easy.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.160
You sad old man!

21:02.920 --> 21:03.920
Jesse, get him out of here.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.920
All good, all right.
Calm down again.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.520
Take it easy.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.680
She is the sister
of the shark victim

21:15.800 --> 21:18.760
Jaydin, and her boyfriend, Tucker, is the
one who's still going to be operated on.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.520
Dr.  Rorish, this is Jaydin.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.640
I am Kaya's sister.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.480
I tried to call, but
my battery was dead.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.840
Is she OK?  Is Tucker...

21:26.000 --> 21:27.960
Take a deep breath.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.760
I... I drove as fast as I
could, but the traffic...

21:31.800 --> 21:33.200
She hyperventilates.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.960
Let's bring her
in, let her sit down.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.800
Dr.  Kean, can we hook
it up to a pulse oximeter?

21:39.280 --> 21:40.480
Could you sit down
here for a minute?

21:43.120 --> 21:44.480
Jaydin, Jaydin...

21:44.680 --> 21:46.800
Please breathe more slowly.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.640
Can I have this?  OK?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.840
Just take a deep breath.
I put that in your nose.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.280
This will help you
breathe a little.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.400
Well here please.  Kaya...

21:56.280 --> 21:57.520
...I'm fine.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.480
And Tucker has an operation.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.920
You have to be very strong
for both of them, right?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.000
OK.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.080
Sit down and catch your breath.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.920
And then I'll take you to Kaya.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.760
How are you in
there, Dr.  Dixon?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.240
How do you like our lounge?

22:32.480 --> 22:34.120
-Oh, good heavens.
-Dad...

22:34.800 --> 22:35.760
I want to know everything.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.160
He is in an artificial coma.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.120
-He came with...
-I asked Dr.  Campbell.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.480
I was even there.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.800
It fell about six meters.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.120
I treated him on the spot
and took him to the ambulance.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.920
When we got to the Angels, he
was already bleeding from his brain.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.840
Pressure had to be relieved...

22:57.800 --> 22:59.360
Dr.  Campbell explains
the operation to you.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.720
Forgiveness.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.480
Hey...

23:11.200 --> 23:12.160
I wanted to talk to you.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.240
It was incredibly
windy up there.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.960
The helicopter suddenly
got caught in a weather vane,

23:19.080 --> 23:20.360
Her brother wasn't
buckled up yet...

23:20.480 --> 23:22.280
He should never have
been in the helicopter.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.880
We thought it would save lives.
That was also the case.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.560
I'm so sorry.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.360
I feel responsible for it.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.080
You are responsible.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.120
There is nothing like
champagne on our wedding night.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.680
He's your father, Randy.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.560
My father ruined
us when I was little.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.640
My mother and I lived in
shelters for the homeless.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.560
You never told me that.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.200
Let's just go

24:14.560 --> 24:16.160
Let's get married as planned.

24:22.000 --> 24:22.960
Can I help you?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.520
Sounds like you had
a failure as a father.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.640
Excuse me?

24:29.000 --> 24:29.960
I had one too.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
I haven't spoken to
my father in 20 years.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.760
Now he's dead and it's too late.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.840
I'm sorry i don't even know you

24:40.960 --> 24:43.840
but you want to give me lessons
about forgiveness and repentance?

24:46.280 --> 24:47.640
I just want to give you this.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.680
-What's this?
-From your father.  Open it up.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.320
It's a suit.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.040
He wanted to come to the wedding.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.400
It fell out of his pocket.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.040
That was probably his toast for you.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.880
Not that I have read
it, you don't do that.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.960
But if I had read it

25:23.560 --> 25:26.520
I would say that your
father regrets a lot

25:27.800 --> 25:29.840
but one thing he
doesn't regret is you.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.840
But I haven't read
it, so what do I know?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.720
They must have misplaced it.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.080
Risa?  Where's Mr. Underwood?

25:57.160 --> 25:58.520
-Henry?
-Yes.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.720
In the operating room.  He was
bleeding, breathless and low on oxygen.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.800
What's happening?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.320
You had to take him
to the operating room.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.760
Will he get well again?

26:09.040 --> 26:10.560
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.480
Are you crazy?

26:25.600 --> 26:26.560
Why don't you like me

26:26.680 --> 26:29.240
How so?  Do you see where
you are  You were forbidden

26:29.360 --> 26:31.080
to do a CT, but you're
still here doing a CT.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.160
And?

26:32.280 --> 26:33.720
You think you can
do anything because

26:33.840 --> 26:35.320
everyone has kissed
your ass for years.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.960
You do not even know me.
And I don't you.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.440
If I am right about the
crepitation, you will still be happy.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.600
And if you're wrong...

26:41.120 --> 26:42.080
Then we both fly out.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.160
That sounds tempting.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.480
There is something with me.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.920
The air is in her throat now.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.080
Something is to blame.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.880
Help us find it
before it's too late.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.000
The truth, Debbie!

26:52.120 --> 26:54.280
I was stupid.  I
let him use a toy.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.680
-What kind of toy?
-Really now?

26:56.040 --> 26:57.040
-That's a toy.
-Yes.

26:57.480 --> 26:58.880
There was an air pump on it.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.560
You could have
mentioned that earlier.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.840
An air pump?  What do
you do with an air pump?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.440
No, don't do that.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.000
-We need Savetti.
-It's collapsing.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.680
-There is no time for that.
-We have to do something.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.960
I do not know what.
The air is everywhere.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.520
Stop, a decompression chamber!

27:15.000 --> 27:17.880
Yes!  The pressure forces the
air back into the vascular space.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.760
Take over here and
I'll get Mario, okay?

27:19.960 --> 27:20.920
Hold on, Debbie!

27:22.120 --> 27:24.480
I said I hate her.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.800
I don't want to see them.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.320
You wanna get mad at
your sister about a guy?

27:28.440 --> 27:32.000
Because I'm a guy too.
We are nothing special.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.360
Tucker is special.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.560
Kaya...

27:36.000 --> 27:37.200
Are you all right?  Is she OK?

27:37.320 --> 27:38.520
She is strong, she will do it.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.800
It's not thanks to her.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.400
Really now?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.680
All of this is your fault!

27:42.880 --> 27:43.840
My fault?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.960
You begged Tucker to go surfing.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.120
I didn't beg him.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.720
He wanted to go.

27:49.840 --> 27:50.800
Nobody invited you!

27:50.960 --> 27:51.920
You just came.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.600
-Like now.
-Now everyone takes a deep breath.

27:53.720 --> 27:54.680
Nobody wants you here.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.640
Tucker only went to the beach
because I wanted to go too.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.520
And you don't understand
that because you're still little.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.720
-I'm 13!
-Right!

28:00.880 --> 28:01.840
I'm finishing this round now.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.600
You want your sister
to take a rest, okay?

28:05.320 --> 28:06.280
Nice.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.600
Maybe you can deal
with her cheek right away.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.440
That went well.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.880
His values ​​are stable.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.120
How often do you check

28:27.440 --> 28:28.400
Not often.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.840
The truth.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.920
Every 30 seconds.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.920
He may stay like
that for a few days.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.360
Maybe longer.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.080
Dr.  Rorish said you
can take your time.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.320
Mario!  She cramps...

28:40.560 --> 28:41.680
-Who?
-The punctured vagina.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.240
We made her to the
decompression chamber.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.320
To the decompression chamber?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.640
What are you talking about?

28:45.760 --> 28:46.720
Come quickly!

28:49.680 --> 28:50.760
How is my shark victim?

28:51.040 --> 28:52.360
Stable.
I have the post-op values.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.520
Good.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.000
I do another blood count
and order 1 g of cefotetan.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.320
Oh my God.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.600
Page Campbell.
It's back to the operating room!

29:17.360 --> 29:18.320
Come on, Debbie.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.600
Charlotte, talk to me.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.880
It's not going fast enough.
I can barely intubate them.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.000
I come in.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.320
Not possible, they are
already under pressure.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.400
What do I do now?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.480
She has to get rid of the air.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.400
I need a scalpel
and some betadine.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.760
And now?

29:46.880 --> 29:49.760
An incision in the
subcutaneous tissue of the neck.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.000
It's not working.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.720
Not so timid, Charlotte.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.160
Cut deeper, through the dermis.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.160
You can do it.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.960
It was horrible today
on the beach in Malibu.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.240
A great white shark
about four and a

30:36.400 --> 30:39.280
half meters in size
attacked three surfers.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.680
One of them was immediately
pronounced dead, and two

30:41.800 --> 30:44.960
more were flown to the
Angels Memorial by helicopter.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.800
We have just received
the report that a survivor

30:48.960 --> 30:51.200
unfortunately
succumbed to his injuries.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.600
The hospital does not
publish the victim's name yet,

30:54.760 --> 30:57.160
but we were told that he
died during the operation,

30:57.320 --> 30:58.800
which should close
his great wounds.

30:58.920 --> 30:59.880
Is that correct?

31:01.200 --> 31:02.160
Is he dead?

31:23.480 --> 31:24.440
I'm sorry Jaydin.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.760
And I'm sorry you
found out that way.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.600
He was all alone.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.040
I should have been with him.
I should have been there.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.480
I want to see him.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.920
Will you take me to him?

31:39.120 --> 31:40.080
I can not do that.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.880
First his parents
have to be there.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.320
They're on the plane!

31:48.640 --> 31:50.480
What should i do?
Just sit around?

31:52.960 --> 31:53.920
Does Kaya know?

31:54.080 --> 31:55.040
No.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.320
She mustn't do that either.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.520
Not yet.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.560
She lost 120 stitches
and a lot of blood.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.720
She has to stay calm now.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.400
This will break your heart.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.280
With the pain you're
feeling right now Jaydin

32:18.120 --> 32:19.280
you mustn't tell her.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.120
Not yet.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.760
You have to be strong for her.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.480
Who is strong for me?

32:51.680 --> 32:52.640
I do not apologize.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.120
If that's why you're here,
you can go right away.

32:58.680 --> 32:59.640
Oh yes?

33:00.800 --> 33:01.840
You do not talk to me anymore?

33:03.560 --> 33:05.120
And you want to be the
more mature of the two of us?

33:07.680 --> 33:08.640
Well, Jaydin,

33:10.240 --> 33:11.200
be a baby

33:13.560 --> 33:14.840
I'll let you rest a little.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.680
Stop!

33:21.280 --> 33:22.560
He's dead, right?

33:32.360 --> 33:33.320
Kaya...

33:33.680 --> 33:35.200
-Just go!
-Kaya, I'm so sorry...

33:35.360 --> 33:36.320
Just leave me alone

33:36.760 --> 33:38.120
You're welcome.  I'm so sorry.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.520
Please just go.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.000
Will he die?

33:53.280 --> 33:56.080
He lost a lot of blood.
He's in bad shape.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.880
Doc,

33:59.040 --> 34:00.600
will my father die?

34:02.840 --> 34:03.800
I am an optimist.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.320
Me too.

34:21.000 --> 34:21.960
Hey pop

34:24.639 --> 34:25.600
It's a nice suit.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.600
I saw him.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.560
I saw that too.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.639
You wrote a toast?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.000
You hate having to
talk in front of others.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.080
Good thing you were
spared that, wasn't it?

34:56.679 --> 34:57.640
"Randall,

35:00.120 --> 35:01.800
I remember when
you were a little boy

35:02.240 --> 35:04.200
You followed me everywhere.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.720
You needed me for everything

35:06.200 --> 35:08.560
It drove me
crazy, but I loved it.

35:10.800 --> 35:11.760
You were my boy

35:13.600 --> 35:14.920
and i loved being your dad.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.440
But it's been a long time
since you needed me

35:21.080 --> 35:24.360
It's long since you said
you wanted to be like me.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.240
Now I want to be like
you when I grow up. "

35:40.640 --> 35:42.200
I still need you.

35:43.000 --> 35:43.960
Do you hear me?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.840
I am your boy
And I still need you

36:02.440 --> 36:03.400
Kaya.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.240
Kaya.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.040
I know it is impossible
for you to understand...

36:14.320 --> 36:15.640
They think i'm still little

36:17.880 --> 36:19.240
and that I can't
understand anything.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.880
I think you are grieving

36:24.680 --> 36:27.000
Nobody understands
grief at any age.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.920
I don't want him to be gone.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.120
-He should come back.
-I know.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.280
And as bad as that is

36:38.560 --> 36:40.480
you're not the only one
who has to endure this.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.360
Jaydin doesn't understand
any better than you

36:44.520 --> 36:46.440
do, and her heart is
broken just like yours.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.240
But she thinks
it's all about her.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.480
She doesn't understand
what I'm feeling.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.800
She is your sister

36:54.600 --> 36:56.320
She's the only one who
understands what you're feeling.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.600
Talk to her.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.040
OK?

37:06.680 --> 37:08.480
This is the only way
you can both manage it.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.520
And I wouldn't
tell you any of this

37:13.120 --> 37:14.440
if i think you're too small

38:02.600 --> 38:03.560
Jaydin...

38:28.480 --> 38:29.440
I love you.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.240
I also you.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.920
The crepitation is gone.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.520
Subcutaneous emphysema?

38:51.080 --> 38:52.040
Who found out?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.160
Noa.  With Dr.  Savetti's help.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.920
Good work.

39:03.000 --> 39:03.960
From all of you.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.920
Savetti, we document that

39:07.240 --> 39:09.280
and they both get a
well-deserved break.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.280
What was that supposed to mean?

39:16.600 --> 39:17.560
I need a girlfriend.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.600
And I think you do too.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.080
Or?

39:23.200 --> 39:24.320
You didn't realize
that, did you?

39:24.880 --> 39:25.840
I was distracted.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.240
I left her alone.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.600
Sorry

39:28.880 --> 39:30.200
The second year is difficult.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.920
You are no longer solely
responsible for yourself.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.960
If you look after new ones,

39:35.120 --> 39:36.640
you are responsible for them.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.840
This is not your fault.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.560
-Sorry I said that.
-You had every right.

40:05.920 --> 40:06.880
No I did not.

40:07.800 --> 40:08.760
You did the right thing.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.720
Sometimes that doesn't
excuse us from the result.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.240
We haven't officially
introduced ourselves yet.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.040
I am angus.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.200
Ethane.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.600
We get one from
your unit every year.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.560
Either they come here as
punishment for making mistakes

40:33.120 --> 40:35.120
or because they did something good.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.840
What applies to you?

40:41.080 --> 40:42.040
Both.
