WEBVTT

00:03.586 --> 00:06.889
This is packed with stones.
Isn't it the flood tunnels?

00:06.924 --> 00:08.157
It's the box drains.

00:08.192 --> 00:09.525
This was what was done

00:09.560 --> 00:11.038
to protect the treasure
in the Money Pit.

00:11.062 --> 00:13.028
That's beginning
to look interesting.

00:13.064 --> 00:16.331
There's a chamber or tunnel
system going from Oak Island

00:16.400 --> 00:18.233
to Little Mash island.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.035
And in that chamber
there are several

00:20.071 --> 00:22.404
hundred tons of gold bullion.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.373
That is a big piece of wood.

00:24.408 --> 00:25.841
That's hand chopped.

00:25.876 --> 00:28.444
This is part of the original
Money Pit.

00:31.182 --> 00:34.650
<i>There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:34.685 --> 00:38.020
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:38.055 --> 00:41.023
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.058 --> 00:44.693
<i>So far they have found bits
of gold chain,</i>

00:44.729 --> 00:48.931
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:52.468
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.503 --> 00:57.740
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:57.775 --> 01:00.409
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

01:00.444 --> 01:03.078
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:03.114 --> 01:05.948
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:21.632 --> 01:25.601
<i>It is the start
of another day on Oak Island.</i>

01:25.636 --> 01:28.237
<i>A day that,
like the one before it,</i>

01:28.272 --> 01:30.606
<i>offers renewed optimism,</i>

01:30.641 --> 01:34.109
<i>and the possibility
that an exciting new discovery</i>

01:34.145 --> 01:36.712
<i>could happen at any moment.</i>

01:36.747 --> 01:40.449
Looks like they've got
the can about 80-feet to me.

01:40.484 --> 01:43.285
It'll be interesting to see
what their rate of advance is.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.053
Yeah.

01:45.089 --> 01:47.956
<i>In an effort
to pinpoint the exact location</i>

01:47.992 --> 01:51.293
<i>of the Oak Island Money Pit,
the fabled treasure shaft</i>

01:51.328 --> 01:54.763
<i>first discovered by Daniel
McGinnis and two friends</i>

01:54.799 --> 01:57.733
<i>back in 1795,</i>

01:57.768 --> 01:59.968
<i>brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,</i>

02:00.004 --> 02:03.739
<i>along with their partners,
agreed to dig two large,</i>

02:03.774 --> 02:09.443
<i>40-inch wide holes at the two
most promising locations.</i>

02:09.479 --> 02:13.415
<i>The first of these was
at the site known as V-3</i>

02:13.450 --> 02:15.117
<i>or "Valley Three,"</i>

02:15.152 --> 02:17.753
<i>where Rick
and Craig Tester discovered</i>

02:17.788 --> 02:19.521
<i>what they thought was evidence</i>

02:19.557 --> 02:22.791
<i>of a seven foot tall
wooden vault first discovered</i>

02:22.827 --> 02:24.860
<i>by treasure hunters
Frederick Blair</i>

02:24.895 --> 02:28.330
<i>and William Chappell
back in 1897.</i>

02:28.365 --> 02:30.299
Concrete and then wood.

02:30.334 --> 02:33.101
That's what they found
in the top of the vault.

02:33.137 --> 02:36.638
<i>The second location,
known as C-1...</i>

02:36.674 --> 02:38.273
Here we go.

02:38.309 --> 02:40.175
<i>Was the site where one year ago,</i>

02:40.211 --> 02:43.712
<i>Rick and Oak Island historian
Charles Barkhouse</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:47.783
<i>discovered what appeared to be
a mysterious metallic object...</i>

02:47.818 --> 02:49.384
What's that?

02:49.420 --> 02:51.220
<i>Embedded in
the walls of a cavern</i>

02:51.255 --> 02:55.791
<i>some 170 feet deep beneath
the surface of the island.</i>

02:55.826 --> 02:57.526
Look how yellow that is.

02:57.561 --> 02:58.827
It's your gold color, David.

02:58.863 --> 03:00.562
Yeah, there it is, David.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.131
<i>But after investing
hundreds of hours</i>

03:03.167 --> 03:06.735
<i>and millions of dollars
exploring the two sites,</i>

03:06.770 --> 03:09.571
<i>the results, though somewhat
disappointing...</i>

03:09.607 --> 03:11.173
We seeing saw marks on there?

03:11.208 --> 03:12.708
<i>Convinced the team that</i>

03:12.743 --> 03:15.310
<i>the location of
the original Money Pit lay</i>

03:15.346 --> 03:18.146
<i>within yards of where
they had been digging.</i>

03:18.182 --> 03:21.250
<i>The question is...
in which direction?</i>

03:21.285 --> 03:25.654
There is no proper reference
material that can say

03:25.689 --> 03:28.190
here is X, dig here.

03:28.225 --> 03:31.560
<i>We have areas unexplored
in the Money Pit where</i>

03:31.595 --> 03:34.196
<i>that vault might have ended up.</i>

03:34.231 --> 03:35.931
<i>We only have one shot left.</i>

03:35.966 --> 03:37.532
<i>So it's gonna have to be</i>

03:37.568 --> 03:41.103
partially data and
partially intuition.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.772
<i>Working from old
maps and charts,</i>

03:43.807 --> 03:47.242
<i>recently discovered in
Dan Blankenship's basement,</i>

03:47.278 --> 03:50.679
<i>Craig Tester was invited to
pick the location for what</i>

03:50.714 --> 03:53.749
<i>is now the team's third
major excavation.</i>

03:53.784 --> 03:55.183
<i>Where do you want to dig?</i>

03:55.219 --> 03:57.119
Well I don't know.
I guess I'm pushing them

03:57.154 --> 03:59.454
towards this corner in here.

04:01.425 --> 04:04.126
<i>Nevertheless, the
decision to continue operations</i>

04:04.161 --> 04:08.096
<i>at the Money Pit site
was not an easy one.</i>

04:08.132 --> 04:11.266
<i>In addition to this year's
planned efforts in the swamp,</i>

04:11.302 --> 04:15.070
<i>at Smith's Cove,
and at borehole 10-X,</i>

04:15.105 --> 04:18.707
<i>the Oak Island team began this
year with only enough money to</i>

04:18.742 --> 04:21.310
<i>dig two holes at the Money Pit.</i>

04:21.345 --> 04:24.880
<i>Only through careful management
of their resources was</i>

04:24.915 --> 04:28.317
<i>the digging of this third
hole even possible.</i>

04:28.352 --> 04:31.753
<i>The stakes, both personally
and financially,</i>

04:31.789 --> 04:34.222
<i>could not be higher.</i>

04:34.258 --> 04:35.490
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.092
- How's it going?
- How are you?

04:37.127 --> 04:38.905
- So, what's the word?
- Right now the word is,

04:38.929 --> 04:42.664
we're 82 feet in the
ground with the casing and

04:42.700 --> 04:45.434
- 75 feet with the excavation.
- Okay.

04:45.469 --> 04:48.804
Going a little slower
right now than you thought or...

04:48.839 --> 04:50.839
No, overall I think
we're a little bit

04:50.874 --> 04:54.242
ahead of the game, but right
now we had to add water 'cause

04:54.278 --> 04:56.244
we had a significant water drop.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.248
The water went down
to 65 feet below...

05:00.284 --> 05:01.650
- Wow.
- This, this grade.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.752
- Wow.
- So there's no water coming in.

05:03.787 --> 05:06.355
You're four feet away from V-3.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.789
- Yeah.
- And there was tons

05:07.825 --> 05:09.358
- of water there.
- Yeah.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.427
That's significant, but what it
means, I don't know.

05:12.463 --> 05:14.096
<i>The absence of water in</i>

05:14.131 --> 05:17.532
<i>the T-1 shaft is indeed unusual.</i>

05:17.568 --> 05:21.136
<i>Excavations at the Money Pit
site usually strike water</i>

05:21.171 --> 05:25.707
<i>at a depth of 40-feet and are
thought to the be consequence</i>

05:25.743 --> 05:28.176
<i>of hitting one of the
booby-trapped flood tunnels</i>

05:28.212 --> 05:30.345
<i>that have plagued Oak
Island treasure hunters</i>

05:30.381 --> 05:33.648
<i>for more than two centuries.</i>

05:33.684 --> 05:35.350
<i>Is it possible that Rick,</i>

05:35.386 --> 05:37.686
<i>Craig and the team have
been successful</i>

05:37.721 --> 05:39.955
<i>at avoiding the flood tunnels?</i>

05:39.990 --> 05:44.860
<i>And, if so, how long might
their luck hold out?</i>

05:44.895 --> 05:46.995
We're going to start
carting the spoils offsite,

05:47.031 --> 05:48.196
that's still the plan?

05:48.232 --> 05:49.197
- Yep.
- Okay.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.866
So by the end of today,

05:50.901 --> 05:53.368
you're hoping to get to
the hundred-foot level?

05:53.404 --> 05:54.836
By end of day today

05:54.872 --> 05:56.182
I absolutely want to get
to the 100-foot mark.

05:56.206 --> 05:57.873
Stuff like this is so hard
to predict

05:57.908 --> 05:59.019
'cause you don't
know what's in the ground.

05:59.043 --> 06:00.976
Sure, sure.

06:01.011 --> 06:04.246
I, I wish you could predict
what's in the ground.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.348
I really wish you could.

06:06.383 --> 06:09.484
'Cause if we're
at the 100-foot level then

06:09.520 --> 06:12.587
it'd start being interesting
what's coming out.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.223
I want to say
at the end of this season

06:15.259 --> 06:17.692
that we either found
the treasure in the Money Pit

06:17.728 --> 06:19.561
or we're done
with the Money Pit.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.264
So I'm, I'm on board with going
for broke

06:22.299 --> 06:24.066
and digging one more well.

06:24.101 --> 06:26.601
<i>We feel we're zeroed in,
if you will,</i>

06:26.637 --> 06:29.604
<i>on this specific area,
so considering</i>

06:29.640 --> 06:32.340
the costs
associated of doing it at

06:32.376 --> 06:35.277
a different moment in time
doesn't make sense.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.878
- Right.
- Do it now.

06:36.914 --> 06:39.247
<i>Could all the years of research,</i>

06:39.283 --> 06:43.785
<i>planning and hard work really
be on the verge of paying off?</i>

06:43.821 --> 06:45.420
- Well, thank you.
- Yes.

06:45.456 --> 06:46.766
We're going to work
over here for a bit.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.557
Okay.

06:48.592 --> 06:51.059
<i>Are Rick, Craig and
the team just a few</i>

06:51.095 --> 06:54.463
<i>feet away from finding
the ultimate target:</i>

06:54.498 --> 06:57.632
<i>The original Money Pit
treasure shaft?</i>

06:57.668 --> 07:00.202
I can't wait until you
get to that 100-foot level.

07:00.237 --> 07:01.903
- Thank you.
- All right, take care.

07:01.939 --> 07:03.071
See you guys.

07:07.486 --> 07:10.754
<i>Continues at
the Money Pit, Rick Lagina,</i>

07:10.789 --> 07:13.723
<i>along with other members
of the Oak Island team,</i>

07:13.759 --> 07:15.959
<i>have gathered in the War Room.</i>

07:15.994 --> 07:17.627
So, guys, I think today,

07:17.663 --> 07:19.663
all of us will find this very
interesting.

07:19.698 --> 07:22.399
<i>Joining them is
researcher Doug Crowell,</i>

07:22.434 --> 07:25.602
<i>who has offered to shed new
light on a piece of evidence</i>

07:25.637 --> 07:27.804
<i>that further connects
the activities of</i>

07:27.839 --> 07:31.174
<i>the Knights Templar to
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

07:31.209 --> 07:32.942
Craig has reached out to

07:32.978 --> 07:35.111
a University of Southern
California professor

07:35.147 --> 07:36.346
by the name of Kevin Knight,

07:36.381 --> 07:38.682
and he and his grad
assistant Nada,

07:38.717 --> 07:41.317
they've done some work
with the La Formule page.

07:41.353 --> 07:43.153
Yep.

07:43.188 --> 07:45.355
Well, let's dial 'em up
and see what they have to say.

07:48.527 --> 07:50.660
Hey Kevin, it's Craig.
How you doing?

07:50.696 --> 07:52.262
Hey Craig, how's it going?

07:52.297 --> 07:54.130
<i>Dr. Kevin Knight is a Fellow</i>

07:54.166 --> 07:56.499
<i>at the Information Sciences

07:56.535 --> 07:59.703
<i>and professor of
computer sciences at</i>

07:59.738 --> 08:02.505
<i>the University of
Southern California.</i>

08:02.541 --> 08:05.375
You sent us, basically
this drawing here,

08:05.410 --> 08:07.343
the Formule cipher.

08:07.379 --> 08:10.046
<i>He, along with his
graduate student,</i>

08:10.082 --> 08:12.682
<i>Nada Aldarrab, have been
working to decode</i>

08:12.718 --> 08:15.618
<i>the mysterious La Formule
cipher,</i>

08:15.654 --> 08:19.055
<i>the same one that New York-
based writer and historian,</i>

08:19.091 --> 08:23.059
<i>Zena Halpern believes is proof
that members of</i>

08:23.095 --> 08:24.728
<i>the Knights Templar visited.</i>

08:24.763 --> 08:28.865
<i>Oak Island
as early as the 12th century.</i>

08:28.900 --> 08:32.335
You know, we've been very
curious on this La Formule,

08:32.370 --> 08:33.970
you know, I've got some
information

08:34.005 --> 08:35.337
that you've already sent me.

08:35.373 --> 08:36.905
- Yeah.
- Can you give the people here

08:36.942 --> 08:38.808
a review of what you do?

08:38.844 --> 08:42.979
We do research in historical
cryptography and we have some

08:43.014 --> 08:45.815
computer programs that
we can apply to ciphers.

08:45.851 --> 08:48.351
So, we've been working together
on this kind of stuff.

08:48.386 --> 08:52.422
Well then, we're talking to the
right people, that's for sure.

08:52.457 --> 08:54.891
<i>The so-called La Formule cipher</i>

08:54.926 --> 08:57.193
<i>is composed
of a number of symbols</i>

08:57.229 --> 08:59.429
<i>which curiously
match those reported</i>

08:59.464 --> 09:01.297
<i>to have been on the so-called,</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:06.870
<i>"90 foot stone" which was found
in the Money Pit in 1804.</i>

09:06.905 --> 09:10.673
<i>When the stone was first
translated in 1862,</i>

09:10.709 --> 09:14.277
<i>"Forty feet below,</i>

09:14.312 --> 09:17.380
<i>two million pounds are buried."</i>

09:17.415 --> 09:20.583
<i>But the translation was based
on the assumption</i>

09:20.619 --> 09:24.854
<i>that the cypher was meant
to be translated into English,</i>

09:24.890 --> 09:27.257
<i>and has opened the door
to speculation</i>

09:27.292 --> 09:30.460
<i>that the actual
code was more complex,</i>

09:30.495 --> 09:34.030
<i>and the translation
even more profound.</i>

09:36.001 --> 09:37.534
Okay you want to go over

09:37.569 --> 09:39.147
how you deciphered this
and what you came up with?

09:39.171 --> 09:40.870
Yeah, sure.

09:40.906 --> 09:43.740
What we have to do is type
into a computer readable format

09:43.775 --> 09:46.442
these cipher letters.
So, we did this and then Nada

09:46.478 --> 09:49.045
ran it through her computer
algorithm.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.382
And the computer said,
"I searched through lots"

09:52.417 --> 09:55.585
and lots of potential languages
that this might be a code for

09:55.620 --> 09:58.621
"and French came out at the top."

09:58.657 --> 10:01.224
And so French is the language
behind the cipher,

10:01.259 --> 10:03.493
at least that's the computer's
initial opinion.

10:03.528 --> 10:05.428
<i>French?</i>

10:05.463 --> 10:09.399
<i>Could this be an important
clue, indicating the identity</i>

10:09.434 --> 10:11.267
<i>of the persons responsible for</i>

10:11.303 --> 10:13.937
<i>creating the Oak Island mystery?</i>

10:13.972 --> 10:17.674
<i>And, if so, does it mean
that the 90 foot stone</i>

10:17.709 --> 10:22.679
<i>was incorrectly translated
more than a century ago?</i>

10:22.714 --> 10:25.181
And so then, what happens next?

10:25.217 --> 10:27.917
Then we proceed to do full
decipherment of the text

10:27.953 --> 10:29.652
against French.

10:29.688 --> 10:31.120
And it looks like there's a lot

10:31.156 --> 10:34.858
of words in there like "five,"
or "forty feet,"

10:34.893 --> 10:36.693
there's some kind of angle.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.639
Those seem like the right kind
of words that you want to see,

10:38.663 --> 10:40.363
so that's a good sign.

10:40.398 --> 10:43.266
Okay.
I did take what you had done

10:43.301 --> 10:47.337
and to me it looks like we're
missing quite a few words.

10:47.372 --> 10:50.540
I've got, "Halt,
do not hold up, dig at,"

10:50.575 --> 10:55.912
then "40 feet with an angle 40
'N-R' degree."

10:55.947 --> 11:01.284
The shaft is 500, 22 feet
to enter the."

11:01.319 --> 11:06.356
Then after that,
there's gaps in the sentence.

11:06.391 --> 11:09.292
There's a word "reid or a,"

11:09.327 --> 11:11.694
and then a word that doesn't
make any sense.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.529
I thought we had come
to the conclusion

11:13.565 --> 11:16.866
that it was one thousand,
'Un Mil.'

11:16.902 --> 11:18.701
Right.

11:18.737 --> 11:22.071
Then, "five feet," and then at
the bottom, "reach the field."

11:22.107 --> 11:26.542
So, it is a good interpretation,
but it sounds to me like

11:26.578 --> 11:29.679
we're missing a lot of
words at the ends or

11:29.714 --> 11:31.481
the beginnings of these
sentences.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.417
Yeah, especially at the
end of the right part.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.753
It says "Enter the"
something and so,

11:36.788 --> 11:38.755
some word that starts with
a "C," so I don't know,

11:38.790 --> 11:41.491
in French, what would you enter
that would start with a "C,"

11:41.526 --> 11:43.426
like a cave or something
like that?

11:43.461 --> 11:48.097
Professor, could that
also be "chamber?"

11:49.935 --> 11:52.435
That's a good connection,
'cause in French,

11:52.470 --> 11:54.337
it's "chambre?"

11:54.372 --> 11:56.172
And then there was
some hint that

11:56.207 --> 11:59.909
where you have
"reid" and "gold",

11:59.945 --> 12:01.744
that may have been a
spelling mistake and

12:01.780 --> 12:04.614
it actually says "corridor."

12:04.649 --> 12:07.717
Yeah, I wanted it so
say "gold" so bad...

12:10.822 --> 12:13.356
Yeah, that part is
going to require guessing.

12:13.391 --> 12:15.758
Your guess sounds reasonable.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.471
You know, this is always
the case with these

12:17.495 --> 12:21.064
historical ciphers,
they often include misspellings,

12:21.099 --> 12:23.232
often included are
archaic usages.

12:23.268 --> 12:24.801
Okay.

12:24.836 --> 12:26.703
<i>It does lead one to wonder</i>

12:26.738 --> 12:28.204
<i>what was supposed to happen</i>

12:28.239 --> 12:30.740
when that 90 foot stone
was encountered,

12:30.775 --> 12:33.276
you were supposed to not dig
deeper; It was a warning.

12:33.311 --> 12:36.813
You were supposed to dig off
to the side somewhere.

12:36.848 --> 12:40.383
<i>The singular
reference of 522 feet,</i>

12:40.418 --> 12:45.989
it's 520 feet from Smith's
Cove to the Money Pit.

12:46.024 --> 12:50.660
If the actual treasure was
buried much nearer the surface,

12:50.695 --> 12:53.062
from a shaft going out
from the Money Pit,

12:53.098 --> 12:55.598
that has always made
sense to me.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.967
<i>Could the La Formule cipher</i>

12:58.003 --> 13:02.472
<i>actually contain a message
connecting Smith's Cove,</i>

13:02.507 --> 13:04.574
<i>where an elaborate
flood tunnel system</i>

13:04.609 --> 13:06.642
is believed to originate,

13:06.678 --> 13:10.646
<i>and a golden treasure buried
some 520 feet away</i>

13:10.682 --> 13:13.149
<i>in the Money Pit?</i>

13:13.184 --> 13:15.618
Zena, some of your
research suggested

13:15.653 --> 13:17.754
that this is
part of a larger document?

13:19.958 --> 13:22.191
<i>When writer and
historian Zena Halpern</i>

13:22.227 --> 13:24.460
<i>first shared
the La Formule cipher</i>

13:24.496 --> 13:27.930
<i>with the team several weeks
ago, she indicated</i>

13:27.966 --> 13:31.768
<i>that it was only one piece
of a much larger document.</i>

13:43.815 --> 13:44.881
Right.

13:58.163 --> 14:01.197
It does fit like a puzzle,
it's ripped into

14:01.232 --> 14:02.732
a puzzle piece, basically.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.412
It seems to suggest seven
pieces of the document.

14:04.436 --> 14:07.036
Seven pieces, exactly.

14:07.072 --> 14:09.038
<i>Seven pieces?</i>

14:09.074 --> 14:11.741
<i>Could the number seven
be a critical clue</i>

14:11.776 --> 14:15.845
<i>to understanding how to solve
the Oak Island mystery?</i>

14:15.880 --> 14:19.082
<i>Throughout history and
mythology, the number seven</i>

14:19.117 --> 14:21.517
<i>has played a significant role.</i>

14:21.553 --> 14:25.321
<i>It not only corresponds to
the number of days of the week,</i>

14:25.356 --> 14:27.590
<i>but also the number of days God</i>

14:27.625 --> 14:30.893
<i>reportedly took
to create the universe.</i>

14:30.929 --> 14:33.396
<i>Seven is the number
of candelabrum</i>

14:33.431 --> 14:35.565
<i>in the Hebrew menorah.</i>

14:35.600 --> 14:38.234
<i>And seven is the number of men</i>

14:38.269 --> 14:41.337
<i>who must die while actively
looking for treasure</i>

14:41.372 --> 14:44.440
<i>in the so-called
"Oak Island Curse."</i>

14:44.476 --> 14:46.709
As we push this agenda forward,

14:46.744 --> 14:49.745
it's very necessary
that we marshal forces

14:49.781 --> 14:53.749
to try to find the other
six pieces of this puzzle.

14:53.785 --> 14:57.653
I think that once all the seven
puzzle pieces are put together,

14:57.689 --> 15:02.558
then it will become a,
a true message, if you will.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.627
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:04.662 --> 15:05.895
Yeah.

15:12.027 --> 15:13.694
<i>Of the Tester-One shaft</i>

15:13.729 --> 15:16.730
<i>continues at the Money Pit,
Rick Lagina,</i>

15:16.765 --> 15:19.466
<i>along with Jack Begley
and Dan Henskee,</i>

15:19.501 --> 15:22.202
<i>have returned to Smith's Cove.</i>

15:22.237 --> 15:25.806
Well, it's much changed.
There's no question of that.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.008
Yeah, a lot was done, yesterday.

15:28.043 --> 15:30.344
<i>They are hoping to
find the remains of</i>

15:30.379 --> 15:32.312
<i>the five stone box drains</i>

15:32.348 --> 15:36.249
<i>that were reportedly
discovered back in 1850.</i>

15:36.318 --> 15:38.552
<i>If they can find evidence
of even</i>

15:38.587 --> 15:40.854
<i>one of the finger-like drains,</i>

15:40.889 --> 15:43.724
<i>they may be able to locate
the master flood tunnel</i>

15:43.759 --> 15:49.429
<i>it is connected to and trace it
back to the original Money Pit.</i>

15:49.465 --> 15:51.198
- Hi, Laird.
- Hi, Rick.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.933
- How are you doing?
- Great. How are you?

15:52.968 --> 15:54.334
- Good.
- Good to see you.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.602
<i>Joining the team is area</i>

15:55.638 --> 15:57.904
<i>archeologist Laird Niven.</i>

15:57.940 --> 16:00.440
<i>He has been hired in order to
insure that any</i>

16:00.476 --> 16:02.442
<i>ancient workings</i>
that may be discovered

16:02.478 --> 16:04.578
<i>at Smith's Cove are excavated</i>

16:04.613 --> 16:07.114
<i>in the most careful
way possible.</i>

16:07.149 --> 16:09.182
So, I think, Dan,

16:09.218 --> 16:10.917
it's a very simple question
that I'll pose:

16:10.953 --> 16:14.421
What do you want to do,
as far as a dig?

16:14.456 --> 16:16.723
Okay, I'm thinking about the,

16:16.759 --> 16:19.226
behind the machine
from this angle,

16:19.261 --> 16:21.795
where the cofferdam takes
a turn.

16:21.830 --> 16:23.463
How deep do you think?

16:23.499 --> 16:26.700
I think it's gotta be
found by experimentation.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.935
So, when you start,

16:28.971 --> 16:31.571
you dig down several feet,
maybe even five feet.

16:31.607 --> 16:33.140
Dan, why don't we walk down,

16:33.175 --> 16:35.942
talk to Billy and get him up
to speed about the dig.

16:35.978 --> 16:38.111
Yes, it'll be dark before too
many more hours.

16:38.147 --> 16:39.946
Yup, yup, exactly.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.916
<i>If one of the original
box drains is uncovered,</i>

16:42.951 --> 16:44.618
<i>it is imperative</i>

16:44.653 --> 16:48.088
<i>that it be done without
causing it further damage.</i>

16:48.123 --> 16:51.158
So, part of what I'm
going to enjoy about this,

16:51.193 --> 16:52.826
not only the hope that we
find something

16:52.861 --> 16:55.228
but my brother thinks he's
a skilled operator,

16:55.264 --> 16:57.998
but I suspect that you're
skilled and he's a novice,

16:58.033 --> 17:00.634
so I want to see what a skilled
operator can do.

17:00.669 --> 17:01.846
Well, let's see
what we can find, yup.

17:01.870 --> 17:04.471
Yup, we're getting
out of your way.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.749
<i>Today in Smith's
Cove, it's going to be</i>

17:15.784 --> 17:18.417
<i>another attempt
to find the box drains.</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:20.753
<i>My hope is that we will find
something,</i>

17:20.789 --> 17:22.521
something legitimate,

17:22.558 --> 17:26.526
something that pointedly says
there was an artificial creation

17:26.561 --> 17:30.464
in Smith's Cove
and that that's how the seawater

17:30.499 --> 17:32.299
was introduced into
the Money Pit.

17:32.334 --> 17:34.668
Water coming up.

17:34.703 --> 17:37.204
What do you mean,
the water's coming up?

17:37.239 --> 17:39.606
That.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.975
Like it's bubbling up
from the bottom?

17:42.010 --> 17:44.711
Well, not bubbling but flowing.

17:44.747 --> 17:46.279
What does that mean, Dan?

17:46.315 --> 17:49.116
It just means we're not
getting seepage from the ocean.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.220
<i>Could the water that has begun</i>

17:53.255 --> 17:55.689
<i>to pool inside the pit be coming</i>

17:55.724 --> 17:58.325
<i>from the outside
of the cofferdam?</i>

17:58.360 --> 18:02.963
<i>Or could it be coming from
somewhere inside the enclosure,</i>

18:02.998 --> 18:06.800
<i>perhaps from some kind
of man-made drainage system?</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:10.003
You can see it. It is coming up.

18:10.038 --> 18:12.639
<i>In order to remove
the rising water</i>

18:12.674 --> 18:14.641
<i>so that the team can continue
digging in search</i>

18:14.676 --> 18:18.245
<i>of the box drains, Rick
and the team hurry to lay out</i>

18:18.280 --> 18:22.082
<i>hoses connected
to a four-inch pump.</i>

18:22.117 --> 18:23.683
Heads up.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.059
All I can say is it
looks like virgin ground.

18:33.095 --> 18:36.496
That that's the right color,
and you know...

18:36.532 --> 18:40.100
Is that, is that a layer of
clay and then it goes to rocks?

18:44.072 --> 18:46.006
That's beginning
to look interesting.

18:49.244 --> 18:52.445
<i>The team has suddenly
uncovered a mysterious pattern</i>

18:52.481 --> 18:54.581
<i>of rocks beneath Smith's Cove.</i>

18:54.616 --> 18:59.286
<i>But is it natural?
Or, could it be man-made?</i>

18:59.321 --> 19:04.191
Jack, do you see stones with
space between them down there?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.426
Those are the ones
I'm looking at.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.895
Yeah.
I'm wondering if there's...

19:08.931 --> 19:10.597
Yeah, that!

19:10.632 --> 19:14.768
That... Isn't that stones,
three, four stones touching?

19:14.803 --> 19:16.036
Yeah.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.448
Careful.
Don't be digging that away.

19:17.472 --> 19:19.306
That's a big rock there,
isn't it?

19:19.341 --> 19:20.351
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

19:20.375 --> 19:21.408
Yeah...

19:25.347 --> 19:26.491
What do you make of it, Laird?

19:26.515 --> 19:27.948
I don't know what to make of it.

19:27.983 --> 19:29.015
No, neither do I.

19:31.987 --> 19:34.154
How about if you dig
that out right there,

19:34.189 --> 19:36.489
see if we can't get a cleaner
look at it.

19:36.525 --> 19:37.691
Everybody clear?

19:37.726 --> 19:38.825
Yep.

19:42.698 --> 19:45.498
Based upon other
diggings around here,

19:45.534 --> 19:46.967
this is an anomaly.

19:47.002 --> 19:48.668
It is an anomaly, yeah.

19:48.704 --> 19:50.837
Yeah, based on what we've
seen so far.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.411
This is packed
with stones right here

19:58.447 --> 20:02.249
and just next to it was,
you know, virgin soil.

20:04.653 --> 20:07.487
Isn't this the description
of what happens right

20:07.522 --> 20:09.589
before they find
the flood tunnels?

20:09.625 --> 20:13.326
Isn't it, like, layer
of coconut fiber, layer of peat,

20:13.362 --> 20:17.497
a bunch of gravel
and this stuff right above,

20:17.532 --> 20:19.699
like, the actual flood tunnels,
right?

20:19.735 --> 20:22.135
Exactly, you're right,

20:22.170 --> 20:26.006
'cause that seems to be,
a layer.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.643
It's unusual looking,
I'll say that.

20:29.678 --> 20:32.012
You think you think you
could gently go deeper there,

20:32.047 --> 20:34.381
like right here,
and just pull that away?

20:34.416 --> 20:36.060
That big rock is there
and I think we'd undermine

20:36.084 --> 20:37.617
the cofferdam if we go
any further.

20:37.653 --> 20:43.056
Yup. Yeah, I'm afraid that's
gonna collapse.

20:43.091 --> 20:44.891
The way she's bleeding through,

20:44.927 --> 20:46.893
all it would take is that thing
to collapse.

20:49.064 --> 20:52.465
I just feel like we
might've gone into, you know,

20:52.501 --> 20:53.867
a "V" of these round stones.

20:53.902 --> 20:57.037
Yeah, but at some point
we have to be safe, too.

20:57.072 --> 21:00.140
'Cause what if the flood
tunnel drain is right here?

21:00.175 --> 21:03.009
And what if, what if that comes
in on you and buries you?

21:05.514 --> 21:07.013
You're right.

21:07.049 --> 21:08.581
If we lose this,

21:08.617 --> 21:11.017
then we lose the opportunity
to continue the search,

21:11.053 --> 21:15.722
if we lose this...
and we're dangerously close.

21:15.757 --> 21:17.490
<i>Although the team has made</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:20.560
<i>what could be a major discovery,</i>

21:20.595 --> 21:24.331
<i>it lies precariously
close to the cofferdam.</i>

21:24.366 --> 21:26.499
<i>If the dam is compromised,</i>

21:26.535 --> 21:30.370
<i>millions of gallons of water
could rush into the cove.</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:35.408
If you undermine that big rock,

21:35.444 --> 21:37.711
we don't even
know how big it is, right?

21:37.746 --> 21:39.546
And if you weaken that,

21:39.581 --> 21:41.859
the water will breach through
underneath it and, you know...

21:41.883 --> 21:43.783
- Then we've lost it.
- We've lost it, yeah.

21:43.819 --> 21:46.019
<i>The team will
have to wait until the area</i>

21:46.054 --> 21:49.456
<i>inside the cofferdam is dryer
and more stable</i>

21:49.491 --> 21:52.292
<i>before they can return
and continue digging.</i>

21:59.484 --> 22:02.285
At Smith's Cove, Rick Lagina

22:02.321 --> 22:05.889
and island historian Charles
Barkhouse have arranged

22:05.924 --> 22:07.891
to meet with local
property owner

22:07.926 --> 22:11.094
and fellow treasure hunter
Gary Clayton.

22:11.129 --> 22:12.429
Well Gary, first of all,

22:12.464 --> 22:14.264
I want to say
thank you for coming.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.565
It's my honor to meet you.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.134
No, no, my honor to meet you.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.438
<i>Having traveled from
his home in Arizona,</i>

22:21.473 --> 22:25.041
<i>Gary is the owner of
Little Mash Island</i>

22:25.077 --> 22:26.910
<i>a small, one-acre landmass</i>

22:26.945 --> 22:30.146
<i>just a few hundred yards
from Oak Island,</i>

22:30.182 --> 22:33.383
<i>and which Gary believes
is directly connected to</i>

22:33.418 --> 22:36.453
<i>the Oak Island mystery.</i>

22:36.488 --> 22:38.655
So what have, what have
you brought us here today?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.724
Well, friend,
I brought you the key

22:40.759 --> 22:42.559
that unlocks the door
to your dreams.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.930
Well, I'm not being
disrespectful here but many

22:46.965 --> 22:49.566
people have said that and
truly believed that.

22:49.601 --> 22:53.236
That's fine, but
mine's not based on belief.

22:53.271 --> 22:57.741
Mine's based upon an assessment
of facts and a record.

22:57.776 --> 23:02.445
<i>After purchasing
the tiny island in 1988,</i>

23:02.481 --> 23:06.583
<i>Gary spent the next ten years
conducting a series of surveys,</i>

23:06.618 --> 23:09.986
<i>drilling operations
and excavations in an effort</i>

23:10.022 --> 23:12.422
<i>to prove a connection
between Little Mash</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:14.424
<i>and the Oak Island mystery.</i>

23:14.459 --> 23:17.260
<i>Like fellow treasure hunter
Fred Nolan,</i>

23:17.295 --> 23:20.263
<i>he became convinced
that answers could be found</i>

23:20.298 --> 23:25.168
<i>not only below ground,
but also above it.</i>

23:25.203 --> 23:28.038
I thought we'd take the time
to look at some targets

23:28.073 --> 23:30.206
under Little Mash.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.809
- Now this is Little Mash?
- That's Little Mash.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.478
It's basically a fish-shaped
island.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.380
They did an assessment
or a test trench

23:37.416 --> 23:40.016
across this area here.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.186
At three feet, they ran
into a solid strip of clay,

23:43.221 --> 23:49.025
12 inches high, running 15 feet
and squared off at the ends.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.694
As they went down at four feet,

23:50.729 --> 23:53.463
they discovered a secondary
topsoil

23:53.498 --> 23:56.299
underneath the first topsoil.

23:56.334 --> 23:59.569
So that suggests to me this
island was completely man-made.

24:01.807 --> 24:07.177
<i>A man-made island?
Some 400 yards from Oak Island?</i>

24:07.212 --> 24:09.646
<i>But if so, who made it,</i>

24:09.681 --> 24:12.482
<i>and for what purpose?</i>

24:12.517 --> 24:17.654
Oak Island, the whole thing,
is covered with a labyrinth.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.723
Fred... both Fred
and Dan believe that.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.758
- Yes.
- That's true.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.160
There's a seal, a chamber
or tunnel system,

24:24.196 --> 24:26.429
going from Oak Island
to my island.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.399
There are certain access points

24:29.434 --> 24:31.367
on both sides of the island.

24:31.403 --> 24:35.371
And, they can be found
by simple equipment

24:35.407 --> 24:38.742
and simple excursion time.
Low cost.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.543
The only difference is,

24:40.579 --> 24:43.580
you have to understand what
the surface is saying to you.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.115
I can read the surface,

24:45.150 --> 24:46.850
and I can understand what's
below it.

24:49.855 --> 24:55.258
This is a stone foot.
It was dug up about 1993

24:55.293 --> 24:57.193
and it was dug up right here.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.462
It's about nine inches long.

24:59.498 --> 25:04.067
There's an obvious
arch underneath, as you'll see.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.569
Now you're looking at the bottom
of the foot.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.905
Here, you can compare
that to this.

25:08.940 --> 25:12.208
You'll notice it's
the same as this.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.043
So the information
on the surface

25:14.079 --> 25:17.380
was telling us
exactly what was below.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.949
What is above, is...

25:19.985 --> 25:21.818
- Down below...
- is below.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.120
So what are,
what are these targets?

25:24.156 --> 25:28.625
This is a foot-shaped void.
That one is 63 feet across.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.895
We drilled four holes,
very close together,

25:31.930 --> 25:33.997
over in this area right here.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.901
And we went down 231 feet.

25:37.936 --> 25:42.138
<i>A 63 foot-wide foot-shaped void?</i>

25:42.174 --> 25:46.676
<i>Located some 231 feet
below ground?</i>

25:46.711 --> 25:50.880
<i>But, if so, how does it connect
to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

25:50.916 --> 25:55.618
<i>And what,
if anything, could it contain?</i>

25:55.654 --> 25:57.954
As far as the story,

25:57.989 --> 26:00.456
the background, the history
of this place,

26:00.492 --> 26:02.325
who might have done it?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.928
I think Lord Anson was
involved in,

26:04.963 --> 26:09.032
in the structure.
He's an English admiral.

26:09.067 --> 26:12.435
<i>Lord George Anson was
a decorated 18th century.</i>

26:12.470 --> 26:14.470
<i>British naval commander.</i>

26:14.506 --> 26:17.640
<i>He was reported to have
been entrusted with a vast,</i>

26:17.676 --> 26:21.711
<i>priceless treasure by members
the English Royal Society,</i>

26:21.746 --> 26:26.149
<i>a select group of Freemasons
with ties to the Rosicruscians,</i>

26:26.184 --> 26:29.118
<i>as well
as to the Knights Templar.</i>

26:29.154 --> 26:31.154
<i>It is believed that members</i>

26:31.189 --> 26:34.991
<i>of the secret order revealed
a coded map to Lord Anson</i>

26:35.026 --> 26:37.227
<i>that relied on constellations,</i>

26:37.262 --> 26:41.331
<i>and which was based on
navigation calculations made</i>

26:41.366 --> 26:43.533
<i>at the Royal Greenwich
Observatory,</i>

26:43.568 --> 26:49.339
<i>under a commission
by King Charles II in 1675.</i>

26:49.374 --> 26:51.774
<i>According to Gary
Clayton's theory,</i>

26:51.810 --> 26:56.713
<i>Lord Anson used this map to
set sail from England in 1740</i>

26:56.748 --> 26:59.249
<i>and with orders
to hide the treasure</i>

26:59.284 --> 27:01.851
<i>somewhere in the New World.</i>

27:01.887 --> 27:03.386
- Ho ho!
- Is that a coin?

27:03.421 --> 27:04.888
That's a King George!

27:04.923 --> 27:07.023
<i>Just a few weeks ago,</i>

27:07.058 --> 27:09.425
<i>metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:12.428
<i>found a number of 18th
century British coins</i>

27:12.464 --> 27:14.530
<i>on the eastern end
of the island.</i>

27:14.566 --> 27:16.900
We've got a button,
we've got coins.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.768
Maybe this is some kind of camp.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.770
1700's, that changes a lot.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.105
They're not supposed to be here.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.840
No.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.375
<i>Could the coins
Gary Drayton found</i>

27:25.410 --> 27:27.710
<i>on Oak Island
offer important evidence</i>

27:27.746 --> 27:32.215
<i>that Gary Clayton's
incredible theory is true?</i>

27:32.250 --> 27:34.183
I think the tunnel system

27:34.219 --> 27:35.852
takes me to several different
chambers,

27:35.887 --> 27:38.354
and some of these chambers
have things,

27:38.390 --> 27:42.191
which are not even
on the archeological scope.

27:42.227 --> 27:48.031
In one chamber, there's a table
and on it is a very shallow cup,

27:48.066 --> 27:51.367
and beside it there's
a golden altar of incense.

27:51.403 --> 27:52.869
That's in one.

27:52.904 --> 27:56.940
In the other one
are two calendars,

27:56.975 --> 27:59.042
the books of Mayans

27:59.077 --> 28:03.112
and some relics which we
cannot identify yet.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.783
On another one we have a tomb.

28:06.818 --> 28:10.253
Then, on the bottom floor
of the same chamber,

28:10.288 --> 28:12.622
we have a sealed door.

28:12.657 --> 28:15.658
And that sealed door goes
to a second level.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.293
And in that chamber...

28:21.366 --> 28:23.967
several hundred tons
of gold bouillon.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.473
- You have any questions?
- I have a question. Wh...

28:30.508 --> 28:33.643
- Ask away.
- Why are you here?

28:33.678 --> 28:39.415
I'm here to give you an offer
for-for a consultant contract.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.117
15% of anything

28:41.152 --> 28:44.420
we find using my information
for one year,

28:44.456 --> 28:46.622
and you get to keep the rest.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.292
Secondly, I know
how much is involved,

28:49.327 --> 28:51.728
and by the information here,

28:51.763 --> 28:55.198
I think that I have a pretty
good chance at being correct.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.935
You sit across the table
from a person who,

28:58.970 --> 29:01.671
who adamantly and fervently

29:01.706 --> 29:03.439
believes in what
they're telling you,

29:03.475 --> 29:05.441
that they've done all their
homework, they've,

29:05.477 --> 29:08.544
they've created this database
of information and...

29:08.580 --> 29:10.646
- It's catchy.
- Yeah, it migrates across

29:10.682 --> 29:12.782
the table, you wanna reach out,
you wanna grab

29:12.817 --> 29:14.717
onto it and latch
onto it and say,

29:14.753 --> 29:18.454
yes, yes, I do, I, too, believe.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.723
You know, Gary, this is a lot...

29:20.759 --> 29:22.503
- It certainly is.
- This is a lot to take in.

29:22.527 --> 29:25.661
I need to talk to my brother
and Craig and Dan and have a...

29:25.697 --> 29:26.974
- That's fine.
- And have a proper discussion

29:26.998 --> 29:29.165
- about your generous offer.
- Good.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.735
And I will relay
the information as best I can.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.737
- All right.
- Appreciate it.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.339
Appreciate it, and
I'm glad to meet you.

29:36.374 --> 29:37.823
Okay.

29:42.130 --> 29:46.299
<i>Continues at the exploration
shaft known as T-1...</i>

29:46.335 --> 29:47.968
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Jack.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.203
<i>Brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,</i>

29:50.239 --> 29:52.639
<i>along with members
of their team,</i>

29:52.674 --> 29:55.108
<i>return to their search
for the man-made box</i>

29:55.143 --> 29:57.510
<i>drains at Smith's Cove.</i>

29:57.546 --> 30:00.847
So, talk to us.
What do you got here?

30:00.882 --> 30:03.450
That feature right there.

30:03.485 --> 30:06.019
Those are big! I mean
that's a big rock right there.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.356
But the rest aren't. It's more
like, you know, human sized...

30:09.391 --> 30:12.459
You know, I built many a rock
wall as you well know and that,

30:12.494 --> 30:15.996
that looks somewhat fitted.

30:16.031 --> 30:19.199
In the late 1980's I dug around,

30:19.234 --> 30:25.005
and I exposed what
looked to me like a wall,

30:25.040 --> 30:27.374
and-and something cut
at an angle,

30:27.409 --> 30:31.144
which reminded me of the
diagram showing the flooding...

30:31.179 --> 30:33.024
That's what I see here.
That's the remnants of that?

30:33.048 --> 30:34.748
Yes.

30:34.783 --> 30:36.427
You ought to come down
and take a look. You can see...

30:36.451 --> 30:37.751
Yeah, I will. I'd like to.

30:42.157 --> 30:43.423
Bring me the elevator, buddy.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.400
<i>What I'm looking at,
I think it's legit.</i>

30:53.435 --> 30:55.001
Going down!

30:55.037 --> 30:57.070
You know, Marty and Craig
may look at it and go,

30:57.105 --> 30:59.606
"bunch of rocks." I don't know.

30:59.641 --> 31:01.274
<i>But I do know this:</i>

31:01.310 --> 31:04.678
<i>That Dan Henskee believes
this is something real</i>

31:04.713 --> 31:06.613
and I'm hoping that
Marty and Craig will, too.

31:06.648 --> 31:09.182
It is interesting,
the gradation, right?

31:09.217 --> 31:11.129
You know, you got the smallest
rocks at the bottom,

31:11.153 --> 31:13.186
then bigger, then big
walloping great ones

31:13.221 --> 31:14.766
that seem to be holding it
all in place.

31:14.790 --> 31:18.124
Now, I don't know,
is that natural or is it not?

31:18.160 --> 31:20.527
I mean, Rick, you think those
look set, inset?

31:20.562 --> 31:24.597
I do.
I think that humans built that.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.199
To what end, for what purpose,

31:26.234 --> 31:28.535
I don't know, but this
face here in particular...

31:28.570 --> 31:30.970
Continues. It's this
wide at least.

31:31.006 --> 31:33.873
- There's still stone there.
- Yep.

31:33.909 --> 31:37.444
Some of these stones
are very much square.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.413
You know, cut. Is that a wall?

31:40.449 --> 31:42.482
What else could it be?

31:42.517 --> 31:44.484
<i>When I first saw the rock wall,</i>

31:44.519 --> 31:46.286
<i>I immediately thought, well,</i>

31:46.321 --> 31:47.887
searchers wouldn't have
been out there

31:47.923 --> 31:50.323
in the cove jumbling
piles of rocks around.

31:50.359 --> 31:52.592
I mean, it would have been
pointless to do that.

31:52.627 --> 31:55.328
I can't, I can't conger
up a reason for that.

31:55.364 --> 31:59.466
So if it is in fact man-made,
it's probably the most likely

31:59.501 --> 32:02.435
thing we've seen with our
own eyes that was original.

32:02.471 --> 32:04.337
Well, let's dig it some more.

32:04.373 --> 32:05.939
- Okay.
- I'm fine with that.

32:05.974 --> 32:07.607
<i>The Smith's
Cove work is actually</i>

32:07.642 --> 32:09.976
<i>at least as exciting
as the Money Pit work.</i>

32:10.011 --> 32:13.646
<i>It's the box drains.
You reveal the box drains</i>

32:13.682 --> 32:15.749
or a remnant of it,

32:15.784 --> 32:18.518
there's a lot of information
that can come of that.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.755
Yeah, Dan's here!

32:23.959 --> 32:25.525
Hi, Marty.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.971
- Hey, Daniel, how you doing?
- Don't fall in though.

32:26.995 --> 32:30.597
No I won't. What do you
make of that, anything?

32:30.632 --> 32:33.833
The fact that there appears
to be stone in there,

32:33.869 --> 32:36.770
and if that has a wall there
and a wall here,

32:36.805 --> 32:39.205
I think they call it
a French Drain.

32:39.241 --> 32:40.306
Yup.

32:41.910 --> 32:44.310
<i>A French Drain is a
type of trench,</i>

32:44.346 --> 32:47.013
<i>which has been filled
in with rocks for the purpose</i>

32:47.048 --> 32:50.383
<i>of redirecting
and controlling water flow.</i>

32:50.419 --> 32:53.153
<i>Although named after
Henry Flagg French,</i>

32:53.188 --> 32:55.021
<i>a 19th century lawyer</i>

32:55.056 --> 32:58.024
<i>and Assistant US Treasury
Secretary,</i>

32:58.059 --> 33:00.126
<i>their design and use is believed</i>

33:00.162 --> 33:03.129
<i>to date back many centuries.</i>

33:03.165 --> 33:05.832
<i>Could the team have finally
found a part</i>

33:05.867 --> 33:08.168
<i>of the original
flood tunnel system,</i>

33:08.203 --> 33:11.805
<i>the one that featured the five
box drains that were first</i>

33:11.840 --> 33:15.875
<i>discovered at Smith's
Cove in 1850?</i>

33:15.911 --> 33:18.178
I think it's continuing, Craig.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.879
I mean, it keeps taking
scoops out

33:19.915 --> 33:21.981
that are pretty much all rocks.

33:22.017 --> 33:24.384
So it's headed back this way?

33:24.419 --> 33:26.920
That would mean
that under the cofferdam

33:26.955 --> 33:30.123
would be the other part of it.

33:34.629 --> 33:35.695
Billy!

33:38.600 --> 33:40.533
I would love to keep
digging this way,

33:40.569 --> 33:42.735
but you can't dig
outside the bladder, right?

33:42.771 --> 33:43.837
Can't. No.

33:43.872 --> 33:45.572
<i>The rock structure,</i>

33:45.607 --> 33:49.042
<i>its close proximity
to the bladder is disturbing</i>

33:49.077 --> 33:52.612
because we cannot carry
that discovery process

33:52.647 --> 33:54.681
in that area.

33:54.716 --> 33:56.382
<i>It's just not safe.</i>

33:56.418 --> 33:59.118
<i>I mean, if we destabilize the
bladder system,</i>

33:59.154 --> 34:00.753
all is lost.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.689
<i>Although the team</i>

34:02.724 --> 34:05.692
<i>must end their search
for the stone box drains,</i>

34:05.727 --> 34:08.628
<i>at least for the time
being, they have made</i>

34:08.663 --> 34:12.065
<i>what they believe
is an incredible discovery:</i>

34:12.100 --> 34:14.601
<i>An ancient man-made
stone structure</i>

34:14.636 --> 34:16.969
<i>beneath Smith's Cove.</i>

34:17.005 --> 34:19.973
Laird, I'm going
to put you on the spot now.

34:20.007 --> 34:21.875
Man-made?

34:21.909 --> 34:24.043
It's definitely
what we'd call "cultural", yeah.

34:24.079 --> 34:25.812
Okay.

34:25.847 --> 34:28.313
You mean you're saying based on
your expertise with certainty,

34:28.350 --> 34:30.949
this is placed here?
It's a man-made, something?

34:30.985 --> 34:32.051
I believe so, yeah.

34:32.087 --> 34:33.418
- Wow.
- Yeah.

34:33.455 --> 34:35.121
Um, because it's relatively
localized.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.056
- Yeah...
- Right, so that kind of rules

34:37.092 --> 34:39.458
out anything geological,
and the sorting

34:39.494 --> 34:41.060
of the rocks is unusual.

34:41.096 --> 34:42.896
<i>We've found something
that we need</i>

34:42.931 --> 34:44.731
<i>to continue to look at.</i>

34:44.766 --> 34:46.331
It's truly a unique structure.

34:46.368 --> 34:48.234
<i>I believe it's original.</i>

34:48.270 --> 34:50.837
<i>But I think we have to
terminate at this point.</i>

34:50.871 --> 34:53.606
<i>There is a closure date
for the permit,</i>

34:53.641 --> 34:56.943
<i>when that bladder system has
to be removed, and it's</i>

34:56.978 --> 34:59.078
very, very near,
so we have to arrange

34:59.114 --> 35:00.580
to get that bladder system

35:00.615 --> 35:02.982
out of Smith's Cove
and stored properly

35:03.018 --> 35:04.651
for perhaps a dig next year.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.097
- We're done here...
- We're done here.

35:06.121 --> 35:07.465
But we're not
done with the search.

35:07.489 --> 35:08.833
Billy, you wanna
fill this in then?

35:08.857 --> 35:10.167
- I will, for sure, yep.
- Okay, thank you.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.457
Thanks, Billy.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.964
<i>Later
that afternoon, Rick Lagina</i>

35:17.999 --> 35:21.768
<i>and Craig Tester arrive
at the T-1 excavation site</i>

35:21.803 --> 35:25.438
<i>for a final update
on the day's progress.</i>

35:25.473 --> 35:27.040
Suddenly...

35:28.643 --> 35:31.044
There's a chunk of wood!

35:31.079 --> 35:32.779
That's vertical!

35:32.814 --> 35:34.647
That's hand chopped.

35:34.683 --> 35:36.115
- Yep.
- Look at the ang...

35:36.151 --> 35:37.295
Do you want
that down here, guys?

35:37.319 --> 35:38.484
- Yeah.
- Yeah

35:38.520 --> 35:40.453
Michel?

35:40.488 --> 35:42.322
Well, what the hell
else could it be?

35:45.060 --> 35:46.693
Thank you.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.496
- Definitely hand cut.
- That is a big piece of wood.

35:50.532 --> 35:53.533
Yeah. So the,
the ends were sawed but the,

35:53.568 --> 35:55.234
this is definitely...

35:55.270 --> 35:58.471
That's, that's an axe there.

35:58.506 --> 36:00.640
That's hand-hewn.

36:00.675 --> 36:02.308
<i>When the vertical
timbers come up</i>

36:02.344 --> 36:04.544
<i>we were all excited immediately.</i>

36:04.579 --> 36:06.479
<i>Now the curious thing is
they're hand-hewn.</i>

36:06.514 --> 36:09.749
That is the first piece
of wood from underground

36:09.784 --> 36:11.417
in the Money Pit

36:11.453 --> 36:14.921
<i>that has been
hand-hewn under our auspices,</i>

36:14.956 --> 36:17.023
First time ever!

36:17.058 --> 36:19.592
<i>A hand-cut wooden timber?</i>

36:19.628 --> 36:24.030
<i>Retrieved from the T-1 shaft
in the Money Pit area?</i>

36:24.065 --> 36:25.665
<i>Has the Oak Island team</i>

36:25.700 --> 36:29.002
<i>finally located
their elusive target?</i>

36:39.681 --> 36:42.448
<i>While the team
from Irving Equipment, Ltd.</i>

36:42.484 --> 36:44.951
<i>Continues digging
a third massive hole</i>

36:44.986 --> 36:47.854
<i>at the Money Pit site known
as T-1...</i>

36:47.889 --> 36:49.522
That's hand chopped.

36:49.558 --> 36:51.658
<i>Rick Lagina and Craig Tester</i>

36:51.693 --> 36:53.459
<i>have arrived just in time</i>

36:53.495 --> 36:56.930
<i>to witness a potentially
momentous discovery.</i>

36:56.965 --> 36:58.631
I'm gonna look at
that bucket drop.

37:05.073 --> 37:06.739
Different type of wood now.

37:09.110 --> 37:11.444
That almost looks like
it was a vertical timber

37:11.479 --> 37:13.179
by the way it came up.

37:13.214 --> 37:15.848
What depth do you have us at?

37:15.884 --> 37:17.550
102 Feet.

37:17.586 --> 37:19.886
102, it could be a tunnel.

37:19.921 --> 37:22.855
A lot of people when they
went down

37:22.891 --> 37:24.490
next to the original Money Pit,

37:24.526 --> 37:26.659
the Money Pit's here, they came
down next to it then

37:26.695 --> 37:27.994
they tunneled over to it.

37:28.029 --> 37:29.395
I see. Yep.

37:29.431 --> 37:32.465
Maybe we're hitting
parts of that tunnel.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
<i>Nearly five decades before</i>

37:34.536 --> 37:36.869
<i>the reported discovery of
the Chappell vault</i>

37:36.905 --> 37:42.075
<i>in 1897, members
of the Truro Company drilled</i>

37:42.110 --> 37:45.478
<i>through what they believed to
be two stacked wooden chests</i>

37:45.513 --> 37:49.749
<i>at a depth of 96 feet.
According to reports,</i>

37:49.784 --> 37:53.586
<i>each were full of what
was described as 22 inches</i>

37:53.622 --> 37:58.057
<i>of "metal pieces,"
or possibly gold coins.</i>

37:58.093 --> 38:00.727
<i>In an attempt to retrieve
the chests,</i>

38:00.762 --> 38:03.496
<i>and avoid the booby-trapped
flood tunnels,</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:07.000
<i>the searchers dug an adjacent
shaft ten feet from</i>

38:07.035 --> 38:09.402
<i>the Money Pit,
and began constructing</i>

38:09.437 --> 38:11.938
<i>a lateral tunnel toward it.</i>

38:11.973 --> 38:14.874
<i>Their hopes of solving
the Oak Island mystery</i>

38:14.909 --> 38:18.611
<i>were quickly dashed however,
as the tunnel collapsed from</i>

38:18.647 --> 38:23.282
<i>flooding just before they
reached the mysterious chests.</i>

38:23.318 --> 38:26.386
We're hoping at this point
in time maybe we'll find

38:26.421 --> 38:29.188
the shallow supposed
treasure from this,

38:29.224 --> 38:30.590
this vault area.

38:30.625 --> 38:31.625
Wow.

38:33.995 --> 38:36.195
- There you go.
- Wow.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.297
We just brought up a
whole bunch more wood.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.799
I'm gonna go look.

38:53.815 --> 38:55.648
What the hell is that?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.119
I don't know what that is.

39:00.155 --> 39:02.422
That is odd.

39:02.457 --> 39:04.757
What if this is part of
the Money Pit,

39:04.793 --> 39:06.426
the original Money Pit?

39:06.461 --> 39:08.327
<i>A round piece of wood?</i>

39:08.363 --> 39:12.465
<i>Located at a depth of
approximately 105 feet</i>

39:12.500 --> 39:16.602
<i>beneath the surface
of the Money Pit site?</i>

39:16.638 --> 39:19.138
<i>When the Money Pit was first
excavated</i>

39:19.174 --> 39:21.340
<i>more than two centuries ago,</i>

39:21.376 --> 39:24.744
<i>searchers reported
finding nine wooden platforms</i>

39:24.779 --> 39:29.115
<i>made of rounded oak timbers
located at ten foot intervals,</i>

39:29.150 --> 39:31.818
<i>at which point
massive flooding halted</i>

39:31.853 --> 39:34.353
<i>further exploration.</i>

39:34.389 --> 39:38.491
<i>Could the Oak Island team
have just discovered evidence</i>

39:38.526 --> 39:41.127
<i>not only of
the original Money Pit,</i>

39:41.162 --> 39:45.198
<i>but of a previously
unknown tenth platform,</i>

39:45.233 --> 39:48.434
<i>ten feet deeper than where
the 90 foot stone was</i>

39:48.470 --> 39:51.704
<i>discovered in 1804?</i>

39:51.740 --> 39:53.306
If you read the records of

39:53.341 --> 39:55.374
them originally finding
the Money Pit,

39:55.410 --> 39:59.145
you know, every ten feet or
so they'd hit a platform.

39:59.180 --> 40:02.014
They thought the vault was
sitting on a platform and this,

40:02.050 --> 40:04.851
you know, three-inch
diameter piece of wood

40:04.886 --> 40:06.819
to me could definitely have been

40:06.855 --> 40:08.788
one of those pieces of
wood from the platform.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.356
You know, can we date this?

40:10.391 --> 40:13.392
I mean, it seems much
blacker to me than this.

40:13.428 --> 40:16.896
This is a very dark gray
but this seems black

40:16.931 --> 40:18.664
and if this comes back,

40:18.700 --> 40:21.400
you know, in the 1500s
or something then...

40:21.436 --> 40:24.070
- It's heavy.
- Yeah, it is heavy.

40:24.105 --> 40:26.038
You wanna just
take a section of it?

40:26.074 --> 40:28.841
Yeah, we'll cut a little piece
off and it'll tell you what time

40:28.877 --> 40:30.543
did this log get cut down.

40:30.578 --> 40:34.814
All right, let's get this
off, see what it comes back.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.816
I don't know what to hope for,
more wood,

40:36.851 --> 40:39.051
less wood, no wood?

40:39.087 --> 40:41.154
Wood that's in
the form of a chest?

40:43.591 --> 40:46.425
<i>Rick, Marty, Craig and the team</i>

40:46.461 --> 40:48.327
<i>appear to be on the verge</i>

40:48.363 --> 40:51.397
<i>of one of the most significant
breakthroughs in their quest to</i>

40:51.432 --> 40:53.766
<i>solve the Oak Island mystery.</i>

40:53.802 --> 40:58.905
<i>But as they continue to dig
deeper, what will they find?</i>

40:58.940 --> 41:01.440
<i>Precious religious artifacts,</i>

41:01.476 --> 41:05.044
<i>wooden chests filled
with gold coins,</i>

41:05.079 --> 41:08.214
<i>the priceless treasures
of the ancient Maya,</i>

41:08.249 --> 41:12.985
<i>or will they come face to
face with an ancient curse,</i>

41:13.021 --> 41:17.190
<i>one that threatens a deadly
fate to those who dare try</i>

41:17.225 --> 41:19.659
<i>and solve the mystery?</i>

41:19.694 --> 41:25.631
<i>Perhaps the answer is now only
a few precious inches away.</i>

41:28.102 --> 41:31.270
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:31.306 --> 41:34.307
<i>The point of interest is
the stones on Oak Island.</i>

41:34.342 --> 41:36.776
<i>I believe these stones
were transported.</i>

41:36.811 --> 41:39.412
My! I've never seen
anything quite like this.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.448
Come on, baby!

41:42.483 --> 41:44.383
Another round
piece of wood there.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.953
This might be part
of the original dig.

41:46.988 --> 41:51.657
This one tested
from 1655 to 1695.

41:51.693 --> 41:53.392
Right there, original Money Pit.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.827
That's what this
is implying, yes.
