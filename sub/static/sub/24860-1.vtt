00:29.834 --> 00:32.125
- Hello.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.625
Hello?

00:37.333 --> 00:39.583
Patrick?
Hello, Patrick, is that you?

00:39.667 --> 00:41.709
Nicholas?

00:42.875 --> 00:46.375
Patrick, I'm afraid
I have rather bad news.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.375
Hello, Patrick?
Can you hear me?

00:50.458 --> 00:51.917
I'm in New York.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.417
There appears to be a delay.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.291
- Yes.

00:58.375 --> 01:01.500
- It concerns your father.
- I can hear you.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.792
I'm here.

01:02.875 --> 01:07.333
Your father died the night
before last, in his hotel room.

01:13.792 --> 01:16.166
It must come as
an awful shock to you.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.500
Something like that, yes.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.917
I hardly need to tell you
how I feel.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.417
I adored your father.
Everybody liked him.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.417
I know he wasn't
always the easiest of men.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.583
Are you there, Patrick?

01:36.333 --> 01:39.834
Yes, I'm here.
Where is he now?

01:41.709 --> 01:45.291
He's at Frank E. Macdonalds,
the funeral people on Madison.

01:45.375 --> 01:46.709
Everyone goes there.

01:46.792 --> 01:51.166
"Only the best or go without,"
as your father would have said.

01:51.250 --> 01:54.208
If you want to see him
and collect the ashes...

01:55.625 --> 01:59.458
- Not at this exact moment, no.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.333
Then we must meet up.

02:02.417 --> 02:05.000
Why don't we meet at the Key
Club? George Watford's here.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.417
We'll raise a glass to your
father's extraordinary life.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.375
Well, until then,

02:10.458 --> 02:13.959
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of such sad tidings.

02:14.041 --> 02:17.542
Yes, it's...a great blow.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.959
Goodbye.

I forgot to ask,
I was too dizzy with glee.

03:57.208 --> 04:00.166
I'm sorry,
I mean, dazed with grief.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.583
Mm-hm.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.667
I wonder - could you please
stop fiddling with my hair?

04:07.709 --> 04:10.500
I need a drink,
a serious drink.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.625
Let's celebrate.

04:13.709 --> 04:15.917
We could go out
for a glass of wine.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.834
Or...you're
probably not interested,

04:17.917 --> 04:18.750
but we have been invited

04:18.834 --> 04:20.959
to Gregory
and Rebecca's for dinner.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.166
"Suffering's what takes place
while other people are eating."

04:22.250 --> 04:25.041
Who said that?
I'm sorry.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.834
I'm feeling a bit mad
at the moment.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.792
It was a complicated
relationship.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.166
There's a lot to think about.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.083
Yes, I'm not sure
the heroin's helping either.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.667
Do you think
that was a good idea?

04:33.750 --> 04:34.333
Of course it wasn't a good idea!

04:34.417 --> 04:35.333
I merely meant that perhaps

04:35.417 --> 04:39.166
this might be a good time
to make a change.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.083
Start afresh!

04:41.166 --> 04:42.959
I'd better leave before you tell
me to seize the fucking day.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.166
Do you think, now he's dead,

04:45.250 --> 04:47.333
that you could be
a little less like him?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.959
Unlikely. I'll merely
have to do the work of two.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.333
Debbie, I'm sorry,
I'm not fit for human company.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.959
Don't go. Stay.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.041
- Come back to bed.
- I can't.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.792
You know,
I heard it said somewhere

05:09.875 --> 05:13.291
that grief was meant
to be an aphrodisiac.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.667
Do you think that might be true?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.917
Ha! You wish.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.709
How's your mother taking it?

05:23.792 --> 05:26.709
She's working with
Save The Children in Chad.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.709
No-one can break the news.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.625
- Always thinking of others.
- Indeed.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.667
- Valium.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.291
That's more like it.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.083
By the way, I think
I'm going to give up drugs.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.417
- You don't think I can.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.417
- I'm a little skeptical.
- I've done it before.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.250
Exactly!
What's so different this time?

05:47.333 --> 05:52.583
You're hardly the Rehab-type and
besides, you like it too much.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.333
Addicts don't give up
until they hit rock bottom,

05:55.417 --> 05:58.041
and you never will.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.250
- You're too upholstered.
- Well, you're wrong.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.166
I'm gonna get it right
this time.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.166
Well, good for you, Patrick!

06:03.250 --> 06:05.250
Cocaine and heroin at least.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.208
Don't want to run
before I can walk.

06:08.375 --> 06:09.500
To which end,
have you got any more Valium?

06:09.583 --> 06:12.917
- Help me wean myself off.
- Sorry, last one.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.625
Please don't take this
the wrong way:

06:17.709 --> 06:19.458
does this mean
you're now fantastically rich?

06:19.542 --> 06:22.959
No, my mummy's the one
with all the money,

06:23.041 --> 06:24.375
and she's very healthy.

06:30.792 --> 06:34.291
"And the sun shone,
having no alternative."

06:34.375 --> 06:36.709
Well, it's time to seize
the fucking day!

06:36.792 --> 06:38.792
♪

06:41.166 --> 06:43.792
Goodbye.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.291
And goodbye.

06:45.375 --> 06:49.041
And goodbye, heroin,
my old friend.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.917
People make far too big a deal
about getting clean.

06:53.583 --> 06:58.375
On the other hand... air travel
can be very stressful.

07:41.291 --> 07:42.250
- Well, good luck.
- Hm.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.542
Don't score off the streets.

07:43.625 --> 07:47.166
I'm not going to score off
anywhere.

07:47.250 --> 07:50.500
Seriously, Johnny.
You must do whatever you want,

07:50.583 --> 07:52.542
but if I'm to take control
of my life, it has to be now.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.125
This is one of the
most important things

07:55.208 --> 07:56.041
to have happened to me

07:56.125 --> 07:58.417
and I want to get
it absolutely right.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.625
I wish I had your determination.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.375
- Thank you for the lift.

08:02.458 --> 08:05.041
As in so many other occasions,

08:05.125 --> 08:06.500
I wouldn't have made it
without you.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.166
It's a pleasure. I'll see you
back here in two days' time:

08:09.250 --> 08:11.291
- a new man.
- An entirely new man.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.166
Will all
passengers recently arrived

08:23.250 --> 08:25.083
from London Heathrow,

08:25.166 --> 08:27.250
please make your way
to the baggage claim...

08:34.375 --> 08:35.709
"Dead, long dead.

08:35.792 --> 08:39.417
Long dead! And my heart
is a handful of dust."

08:39.500 --> 08:42.291
And...something...
something else.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.250
Oh, for Christ's sake, cheer up.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.208
Think happy thoughts.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.959
Remember why you're here.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.667
You're here to collect
your father's corpse!

08:54.333 --> 08:58.458
Valium's wearing off, feeling
just a little twitchy now.

08:58.542 --> 09:02.000
Hold on. Just...hold on.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.458
Queasy, nervous,
maggots under the skin,

09:07.542 --> 09:09.083
litter of drowning kittens
in my stomach.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.250
Fuck off!

09:10.333 --> 09:11.583
Can you take another route?

09:11.667 --> 09:14.792
I really, really need
to get to my hotel.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.917
Here.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.792
Mr. Melrose!
Good to see you again.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.458
Your usual suite is ready.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.417
And a message for you.

09:34.959 --> 09:37.000
Always eloquent.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.959
Could you please send up
a bottle of whiskey

09:39.041 --> 09:41.208
- and a very great deal of ice--

09:41.291 --> 09:43.166
Of course.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.542
♪ classical music ♪

09:45.625 --> 09:46.875
This is the lift.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.625
33!

09:50.709 --> 09:54.000
- Christ, talk about temptation.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.000
Oh, nothing.
Just talking to myself.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.166
This is the hallway.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.333
Here is your room.
3318.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.417
This is your key.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.208
It works!

10:12.125 --> 10:13.875
Here we go, you know the drill.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.083
Another withdrawal
in a foreign hotel room.

10:16.166 --> 10:18.083
Bathroom light.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.041
Here's your TV, turn it on here.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.417
And this is how
you change channels.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.542
Yes, I have used
a television before.

10:23.625 --> 10:26.166
Paranoia, cramps,
suicidal thoughts...

10:26.250 --> 10:28.291
Thank you.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.208
Still, at least
it's the last time.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.709
Or among the last times.

10:38.792 --> 10:42.667
Not this time.
This time it's different.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.291
No prisoners. Concentration
like a flame-thrower.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.709
New day, new beginning.

10:47.792 --> 10:50.583
The trick is
not to think about it.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.375
How can you not think about it?

10:53.458 --> 10:55.375
It's like not wanting
to get out of a wheelchair

10:55.458 --> 10:57.291
when the room's on fire.

11:05.250 --> 11:08.041
Oh, God.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.250
For the best heroin in town,

11:14.333 --> 11:17.291
simple call Pierre, 555-1726.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.709
That's Pierre, 555-1726.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.375
Don't think about it.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.208
Patrick!

11:24.291 --> 11:25.709
Yes, Nanny?

11:25.792 --> 11:29.041
What you need, young man,
is a nice walk in the park.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.250
♪ rock music ♪

11:33.333 --> 11:35.333
No smack, though!

11:35.417 --> 11:36.750
I want to make that
absolutely clear!

11:36.834 --> 11:38.417
No, Nanny.
No smack, I swear.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.917
Got any Quaaludes?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.166
Sure, I got Quaaludes.
Lemmon 714s, five dollars each.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.750
I can hardly be expected to
give up everything at once.

11:44.834 --> 11:49.375
I'll take five, no, six.
What about speed?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.291
Why the hell are you buying
speed

11:51.375 --> 11:54.291
Yo. I got some Black Beauties,
man. They're pharmaceutical.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.417
Meaning you made them yourself?

11:55.500 --> 11:57.458
- Meaning they're good.
- Do not buy any speed.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.000
Give me three.
Impulse buy.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.333
- That's right.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.291
Ain't you hot in that coat?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.125
I hear they give you
free heroin there?

12:05.208 --> 12:07.500
- Don't bother the man.
- Well, not exactly free.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.375
Take your coat off, man,
you sweating.

12:09.458 --> 12:10.250
Wanna buy some smack,
British guy?

12:10.333 --> 12:12.291
I got cocaine too,
real good shit.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.000
- I said don't bother him.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.709
I don't doubt it,
but I've given that up!

12:15.792 --> 12:18.333
Yo, man,
you need some water, man.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.250
I'm not an amateur.
- Uh-huh.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.417
Yo, you come back here tomorrow!

12:33.917 --> 12:35.250
Can I help you, sir?

12:35.333 --> 12:38.500
Yes, I've come to see
the corpse.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.500
Sorry, can I have a glass
of water

12:43.625 --> 12:45.583
I have a large pill
stuck in my--

12:47.583 --> 12:47.875
Not enough saliva...

12:57.542 --> 13:00.333
Ahhhhh!

13:02.583 --> 13:04.458
Now.

13:04.542 --> 13:07.333
I've come to see the corpse
of David Melrose.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.583
You'll find Mr. Melrose
at the end of the corridor.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.250
Patrick! Come here!
Right now!

13:45.709 --> 13:49.750
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars...

13:51.250 --> 13:53.750
..Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

14:11.125 --> 14:14.625
Er... No, thank you.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.667
Mojito
Old

14:24.500 --> 14:26.667
Oh, how did you know Hermann?

14:27.792 --> 14:31.500
- I can't fucking believe it!
- Oh!

14:31.583 --> 14:33.625
Whoa, there!

14:34.208 --> 14:36.917
Wrong fucking corpse!

14:37.000 --> 14:40.291
- Death transforms us all,

14:40.375 --> 14:43.417
but it's not so powerful as to
turn my father into a small Jew.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.458
Try again.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.542
Uh... But we don't have
another party in the building.

14:48.625 --> 14:53.792
I don't want to go to a party,
I want to see David Melrose!

14:55.041 --> 14:58.625
- This is the correct room.
- Thank you.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.792
- And please apologize to--
- No, no, no.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.792
It's an emotional time.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.583
Yes, that's why
I took a Quaalude

15:04.667 --> 15:06.625
but it must have been a dud.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.291
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.208
I would like to get away from
New York if at all possible.

15:12.291 --> 15:15.625
Your father's ashes will be
available tomorrow afternoon.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.959
I see.
No chance of a rush job?

15:20.375 --> 15:22.750
I'll leave you alone with him.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.125
Come on. Come on. Come on.

15:42.792 --> 15:44.792
Get this right.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.834
Is it...Is it Dad?

16:06.959 --> 16:09.583
It is!
It's just what I wanted!

16:09.667 --> 16:12.500
You shouldn't have!

16:17.458 --> 16:19.125
Fucking hell, Dad.
What are you doing in a coffin?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.125
What happened here?

17:01.625 --> 17:03.500
You didn't want to go, did you?

17:07.041 --> 17:10.041
You knew you were going to die
and you were right.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.041
What did that feel like?

17:15.750 --> 17:19.083
Pain or rage?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.750
Were you scared?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.083
Christ, I hope so.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.333
No. No.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.792
No, no, no!

17:47.208 --> 17:49.834
Aargh! Aargh! Fuck.

17:59.041 --> 18:02.542
Aw,
you're so fucking sad, Dad, man,

18:02.625 --> 18:05.500
and now you're trying to
make me sad too. Boo-hoo.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.458
Well, bad luck.

18:25.834 --> 18:30.083
Hello, Patrick.
What's up?

18:34.959 --> 18:36.458
You're shaking.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.875
What is it, Patrick?

18:39.959 --> 18:42.875
What about your mother?
Do you want to tell your mother?

18:44.500 --> 18:48.166
Okay, I'll be right back.
I promise.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.500
Well, that looks fun.

18:58.583 --> 19:00.875
Uh... Antibiotics.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.083
- Patrick. I am so sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.041
Punctuality is one
of the smaller vices

19:05.125 --> 19:07.625
I've inherited from my father.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.375
I think you know
that's not what I meant.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.166
- Oh, tea, please, Earl Grey.
- Uh-huh.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.834
- Certainly.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.083
For me, it's nine o'clock.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.208
For you,
it's always nine o'clock.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.041
Oh, what the hell -
a martini for me too, please.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.917
- So, have you been to...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.458
Yes, yes,
the best I've ever seen him.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.625
Well, I don't wanna
disillusion you,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.500
but when
they give you the ashes,

19:30.583 --> 19:32.417
they're really just
the communal rakings

19:32.500 --> 19:34.583
- from the bottom of the oven.
- That's good news!

19:34.667 --> 19:37.208
Ideally they'd all belong
to someone else. Hm.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.583
When I was young, he used
to take us to restaurants -

19:41.667 --> 19:43.041
I say restaurants in the plural,

19:43.125 --> 19:45.542
because we never stormed
in and out of less than three.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.291
I remember one occasion he held
a bottle of claret upside down

19:48.375 --> 19:52.500
as the contents gurgle out
onto the carpet.

19:52.583 --> 19:56.250
"How dare you
bring me this filth?"

19:56.333 --> 19:59.250
Well, at least he's somewhere
he can't complain about.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.625
I half expected him to sit
upright in the coffin

20:01.709 --> 20:04.083
like a vampire at sunset.

20:04.166 --> 20:07.709
"Call this a coffin? The service
here is intolerable!"

20:09.834 --> 20:12.125
Mind you, the service
was intolerable.

20:12.208 --> 20:12.959
They sent me
to the wrong corpse.

20:13.041 --> 20:15.792
- Yes.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.458
Ironic that my father's remains
were so hard to find,

20:17.542 --> 20:20.959
when I have no trouble
discovering them in myself.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.500
It's good to see you, Anne.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.291
I did need to see
a friendly face.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.750
Well...he was a complicated man.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.041

20:37.125 --> 20:39.291
..so keen to talk to you today.

30:38.542 --> 30:41.458
To have tried and actually
achieved something

No. Not just that.

I've got a hunting story for
you, Ballantine, from my father.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.834
- Nicholas, you know the one.
- Steady on, Patrick.

41:52.917 --> 41:54.375
- Enough now.
- Father was a cavalry officer

41:54.458 --> 41:56.417
stationed in India in the 1920s,

41:56.500 --> 41:58.250
and he used to go pig-sticking,
galloping through the high grass

41:58.333 --> 42:01.083
with a lance, hunting wild boar.

42:01.166 --> 42:03.875
Very dangerous, these wild boar.
They could take down a horse,

42:03.959 --> 42:06.083
and gore a rider to death -
but thrilling too.

42:06.166 --> 42:08.750
Anyway, the only blemish
on this particular trip...

42:08.834 --> 42:11.417
I think I heard this story
when I was, what, eight?

42:11.500 --> 42:14.250
..was that one of the hunting
party was bitten by a wild dog

42:14.333 --> 42:15.875
and developed
the symptoms of rabies.

42:15.959 --> 42:17.834
Three days from the nearest
hospital and this hunting party

42:17.917 --> 42:20.083

decided to truss up

42:20.166 --> 42:22.875

thrashing friend in a net

42:22.959 --> 42:25.166

Dinner was served...

42:27.709 --> 42:30.291

gleam of silver,

42:30.375 --> 42:32.959
well-trained servants.

42:33.041 --> 42:36.834
But none of us could quite enjoy
dinner with all that screaming.

42:36.917 --> 42:38.583
So I got up from the table,

42:38.667 --> 42:42.792
fetched my pistol,
went over to the rabid man

42:42.875 --> 42:44.750
and shot him in the head.

42:50.709 --> 42:53.291
Much the kindest thing to do.

42:53.375 --> 42:54.125
Everyone agreed.

42:54.208 --> 42:56.333
Eventually.

42:57.166 --> 42:59.375

44:39.041 --> 44:41.208
I have half a gram of coke,
a fifth of heroin,

44:41.291 --> 44:42.250
one Quaalude,
one Black Beauty.

44:42.333 --> 44:44.583
A few lines to get
the conversation flowing,

44:44.667 --> 44:46.333
a Quaalude for Marianne
to get her in the mood.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.959
Perhaps pity is the way,

44:48.041 --> 44:49.875
in which case use it for the
comedown, sleep on the plane.

44:49.959 --> 44:50.959
My God, you're good.

44:51.041 --> 44:52.917
Then you're home,
thank Christ for Concorde.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.083
Johnny will be waiting and...

44:55.166 --> 44:56.792
Well, let's see.

44:58.709 --> 45:02.458
Hello, I'm Patrick,
Marianne's friend.

45:02.542 --> 45:05.041
Nancy, Nancy Banks.
We have met.

45:05.125 --> 45:08.291
- Yes, of course. Oh!

45:08.375 --> 45:10.917
Sorry, bit distracted.
It's just erm...

45:11.000 --> 45:13.959
Yes, Marianne told us.
Is that him?

45:14.041 --> 45:16.000
I'll tell Consuela there'll
be one more for dinner!

45:16.083 --> 45:18.291
- Marianne!

45:18.375 --> 45:20.500
- She is dying to see you!
- Awww!

45:20.583 --> 45:23.667
Jerry, you remember Patrick,
lovely Debbie's boyfriend.

45:23.750 --> 45:24.750
I turned blue in your bathroom.

45:24.834 --> 45:27.625
- We had to take the door off!
- Yes!

45:27.709 --> 45:29.208
- Come in, come in!
- 'Tis I.

45:32.208 --> 45:34.458
Marianne says he was
a remarkable man.

45:34.542 --> 45:37.083
Hm! You should
have heard the remarks.

45:37.166 --> 45:39.458
Was it a difficult relationship,
Patrick?

45:39.542 --> 45:42.667
Yes, Nancy. Yes, it was.

45:42.750 --> 45:44.291
- 9th June, 1906.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.792
The day he was born.

45:45.875 --> 45:49.709
Well, fatherhood was very
different in those days.

45:49.792 --> 45:50.875
Mm-hmm.

45:50.959 --> 45:54.166
Yes, perhaps he just didn't know
how to express his love?

45:54.250 --> 45:56.041
Cruelty is the opposite of love,

45:56.125 --> 45:57.500
not some inarticulate
expression of it.

45:57.583 --> 46:00.500
That sounds about right to me.

46:01.458 --> 46:04.834
Oh, Marianne...

46:04.917 --> 46:07.500
Although, that's not something
I've ever had to worry about.

46:07.583 --> 46:10.667
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hello.

46:10.750 --> 46:12.625
I'm so, so sorry for your loss.

46:12.709 --> 46:14.458
You're the answer. You're the
one to save me, can't you tell?

46:14.542 --> 46:16.667
I want to be buried here.

46:16.750 --> 46:17.333
If I could have you,
I'd give up drugs forever.

46:17.417 --> 46:19.542
Goodness!

46:19.625 --> 46:21.667
Or at least have someone
attractive to take them with.

46:21.750 --> 46:23.959
Can we go out to dinner?
Please say yes!

46:25.417 --> 46:29.375
- Absolutely. I love Armenian.

46:31.834 --> 46:34.291
Are you gonna be hot
in your coat?

46:34.375 --> 46:35.709
Oh. If it makes you feel
uncomfortable, then...

46:35.792 --> 46:38.542
- A little.
- Well, off it comes.

46:39.709 --> 46:42.041
Perhaps I should take
my eye-patch off too...

46:42.125 --> 46:44.625
I'll leave it on.
Two martinis, please.

46:44.709 --> 46:47.750
- One. I don't drink.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.500
Bad sign. Very, very bad.

46:49.583 --> 46:52.208
I find it blurs the edges
and dulls the senses.

46:52.291 --> 46:52.792
Your point being?

46:52.875 --> 46:53.875
I absolutely agree.

46:53.959 --> 46:57.250
I don't usually either
but, you know - grief.

47:00.458 --> 47:02.291
Say something,
remember how this is done,

47:02.375 --> 47:03.542
Something other than lies
or ridicule or contempt.

47:03.625 --> 47:05.792
Debbie sends her love.

47:05.875 --> 47:08.125
- Not that, you fucking idiot!
-  Sweet Debbie.

47:09.542 --> 47:12.333
- Oh, she's a great girl.

47:13.417 --> 47:15.750
Very, very supportive.

47:15.834 --> 47:16.792
Change the subject.

47:16.875 --> 47:19.750
She tells me
you're studying law.

47:19.834 --> 47:22.083
That's right! At Columbia.

47:22.166 --> 47:25.083
It's really tough,
but I love it.

47:25.166 --> 47:26.542
I once thought about
studying law.

47:26.625 --> 47:29.250
Imagined myself in Twelve Angry
Men  , terrifically articulate,

47:29.333 --> 47:30.375
righting wrongs--

47:30.458 --> 47:31.792
You'd have been
a wonderful lawyer.

47:31.875 --> 47:33.667
- Thank you.
- You absolutely should do it!

47:33.750 --> 47:34.792
- 'Cause hard work

47:34.875 --> 47:36.625
- and ambition are vulgar.
- Oh, my God,

47:36.709 --> 47:38.208
you don't believe that, do you?

47:38.291 --> 47:40.333
Me? No, no, no, no,
That's what he said.

47:41.583 --> 47:42.959
Well, you have
an education and...

47:46.917 --> 47:48.458
Thank you. I mean...

47:49.667 --> 47:54.417
And besides,
you're not your father.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.917
You are absolutely right.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.458
Do you know what?
I feel inspired!

47:58.542 --> 48:02.041
I'm gonna do something about it
the minute I get off the plane.

48:02.125 --> 48:04.583
A new man! Do you hear that,
Dad? I'm gonna be a lawyer!

48:04.667 --> 48:06.333
Patrick, I'm concerned
about the box.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.417
Don't be, I think
it counts as hand luggage.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.458
No, I meant:
could you put it on the floor?

48:10.542 --> 48:12.125
Yes!

48:12.208 --> 48:16.041
Let the waiters kick him about.
Revenge at last!

48:18.250 --> 48:21.792
Why should he get away with it,
just because he's dead?

48:22.542 --> 48:23.917
Get away with what?

48:27.667 --> 48:29.542
I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?

48:38.458 --> 48:40.542
I thought you liked
Armenian food?

48:40.625 --> 48:42.834
The martinis are excellent.

48:44.583 --> 48:46.333
"They fuck you up,
your mum and dad.

48:46.417 --> 48:47.917
They may not mean to,
but they do."

48:48.000 --> 48:52.250
Who says they don't mean to?

48:52.333 --> 48:54.583
Tell me, did you ever tell your
dad how you felt about him?

48:54.667 --> 48:57.834
Not while he was alive.

48:57.917 --> 48:59.667
- Probably for the best.

48:59.750 --> 49:01.583
I mean,
what would you have said to him?

49:03.792 --> 49:06.792
I... I would have said...

49:09.792 --> 49:10.917
I would have told him...

49:11.000 --> 49:13.709
"Nobody should do that
to anybody else."

49:13.792 --> 49:15.250
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, sorry.

49:15.333 --> 49:16.792
I took the question seriously.

49:16.875 --> 49:18.041
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
you were saying?

49:19.458 --> 49:22.834
Oh. Just that...

49:27.625 --> 49:29.125
Never mind.

49:33.667 --> 49:35.959
Patrick, I erm...
I should be getting back.

49:36.041 --> 49:38.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Marianne...

49:41.959 --> 49:43.041
We've always had a connection,
haven't we?

49:43.125 --> 49:46.375
I mean,
I'm not just imagining it.

49:46.458 --> 49:49.250
Well, no, I've always been
very fond of you and Debbie.

49:53.792 --> 49:56.625
I don't suppose you
want to do a Quaalude, do you?

49:56.709 --> 49:57.834
I'm sorry
for being a bit screwy.

49:57.917 --> 50:00.959
No. It's an emotional time.

50:01.625 --> 50:02.542
Taxi!
Good night, Patrick.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.625

Good night.

I was to meet the right woman,

afraid to challenge me,

50:17.709 --> 50:19.250
I might actually be able
to get my life back in order.

50:19.333 --> 50:23.208
Please, stop. You are
making a fool of yourself.

50:23.291 --> 50:24.417
