NASIM ALSO TOLD US

29:13.833 --> 29:16.375
THAT YOU BROKERED THE DEAL
WITH NAVILET,

29:16.375 --> 29:19.638
THAT YOU MET WITH GORDON SLOANE
A HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

29:19.638 --> 29:22.051
YOU COOKED UP THIS SCAM
TOGETHER, DIDN'T YOU?

29:22.051 --> 29:23.843
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
IT WAS A WIN-WIN.

29:23.843 --> 29:26.645
SLOANE SELLS A WAREHOUSE
FULL OF DRUGS THAT NOBODY WANTS,

29:26.645 --> 29:28.057
AND YOU GET A BIG KICKBACK.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.768
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE WE FIND

29:29.768 --> 29:32.731
THAT OFFSHORE ACCOUNT
AND LINK IT BACK TO YOU.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.274
I SAW THAT SILVER MERCEDES
PARKED IN YOUR SPOT.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.156
THAT DOES SEEM
A LITTLE BIT OBVIOUS, THOUGH,

29:37.156 --> 29:38.157
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:39.568 --> 29:41.110
AFTER THE REPORTER

29:41.110 --> 29:43.032
THREATENED TO BLOW THE LID
OFF YOUR LITTLE SCHEME,

29:43.032 --> 29:45.074
YOU REALIZED THAT YOU HAD TO
KILL HIM AND THE CONSUL.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.665
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

29:46.665 --> 29:49.168
IF YOU'VE GOT EVIDENCE,
THEN YOU CHARGE ME. OTHERWISE --

29:49.168 --> 29:50.749
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT CHARGING YOU.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.962
THE STATE DEPARTMENT
WILL HAVE YOU EXPELLED.

29:52.962 --> 29:54.753
I'M SURE
THE BANGLADESHI GOVERNMENT

29:54.753 --> 29:56.545
WILL BE THRILLED
TO HAVE YOU BACK

29:56.545 --> 29:59.798
WHEN THEY LEARN ABOUT YOUR PLAN
AND ALL THE LIVES IT COST.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.800
OH, AND DON'T THINK
GORDON SLOANE IS GONNA HELP YOU.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.013
HE'S GOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO SPEND ON LAWYERS,

30:04.013 --> 30:06.725
AND THEY ARE ALL TELLING HIM TO
LET YOU TAKE THE FALL FOR THIS.

30:10.980 --> 30:13.312
[ SIGHS ]

30:13.312 --> 30:15.144
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

30:15.144 --> 30:16.525
TESTIFY AGAINST SLOANE.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.317
THE U.S. ATTORNEY
HAS ASSURED ME

30:18.317 --> 30:19.939
THAT IF YOU COOPERATE,

30:19.939 --> 30:22.491
YOU'LL SERVE A REDUCED SENTENCE
IN A U.S. PRISON.

30:22.491 --> 30:24.533
[ SIGHS ]

30:26.535 --> 30:29.038
LOOK...

30:29.038 --> 30:31.040
I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS NEW STRAIN OF CHOLERA

30:31.040 --> 30:33.542
WAS GOING TO SPREAD
TO MY COUNTRY --

30:33.542 --> 30:35.414
CERTAINLY NOT THIS FAST.

30:35.414 --> 30:38.507
EVENTUALLY, THE NEW STRAIN
MAY FIND ITS WAY TO SOUTH ASIA,

30:38.507 --> 30:40.759
BUT IN MY OPINION,
IT'S NOT SOMETHING

30:40.759 --> 30:43.342
YOUR GOVERNMENT
SHOULD WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.425
THE NUMORAL VACCINE WILL
MEET YOUR NEEDS. I ASSURE YOU.

30:46.425 --> 30:47.887
BUT BACTRA-VOX
IS EFFECTIVE

30:47.887 --> 30:49.848
AGAINST THE NEWER
CHOLERA STRAINS.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.931
HOW CAN I JUSTIFY
BUYING ONE THAT ISN'T,

30:51.931 --> 30:53.772
ESPECIALLY
IF THE PRICE IS THE SAME?

30:53.772 --> 30:55.684
DON'T YOU WANT TO SELL ME
YOUR BEST PRODUCT?

30:55.684 --> 30:58.067
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,

30:58.067 --> 31:00.940
WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS
PRODUCING THE NEW VACCINE.

31:00.940 --> 31:02.531
THERE'S A BACKLOG.

31:02.531 --> 31:04.403
IT'LL BE MONTHS
BEFORE IT'S AVAILABLE

31:04.403 --> 31:06.445
IN THE QUANTITIES
THAT YOU NEED.

31:06.445 --> 31:08.287
THEN I GUESS
I'LL HAVE TO SEE

31:08.287 --> 31:10.449
WHAT YOUR COMPETITORS
ARE OFFERING.

31:10.449 --> 31:13.122
HOLD ON.

31:13.122 --> 31:16.625
IF YOU WERE WILLING
TO CONSIDER THE OLDER DRUG,

31:16.625 --> 31:21.590
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO OFFER YOU...AN INCENTIVE.

31:25.764 --> 31:26.635
HOW MUCH?

31:29.268 --> 31:34.013
$100,000 TO MAKE SURE
THE CONTRACT WENT THROUGH.

31:34.013 --> 31:36.725
BUT I KNEW THE CONSUL
WOULDN'T SIGN THE CONTRACT.

31:36.725 --> 31:38.897
HE HAD ALL OF MY RESEARCH
ON THE VACCINES.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.519
SO YOU AND SLOANE
MADE THE CONSUL THINK

31:40.519 --> 31:42.191
HE WAS BUYING
THE NEW VACCINE.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.193
THEN YOU SWITCHED OUT THE
PAPERWORK TO COVER YOUR ASSES,

31:44.193 --> 31:46.735
SO IT LOOKED LIKE HE KNOWINGLY
BOUGHT THE OLDER DRUG.

31:46.735 --> 31:48.657
YOU AND NASIM WERE ALREADY
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.239
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

31:50.239 --> 31:51.740
YOU KNEW THAT SHE'D FORGE
THE CONSUL'S SIGNATURE

31:51.740 --> 31:52.741
WHEN YOU ASKED.

31:52.741 --> 31:54.033
THEN THE DEAL WAS DONE.

31:54.033 --> 31:55.374
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN THE CLEAR,

31:55.374 --> 31:56.915
UNTIL THE REPORTER
SHOWED UP.

31:59.538 --> 32:01.500
YES.

32:01.500 --> 32:05.714
WHEN I OVERHEARD HIM
TALKING TO OUR SECURITY CHIEF,

32:05.714 --> 32:07.756
I KNEW WE HAD A PROBLEM.

32:07.756 --> 32:09.598
Mehta: I'M SORRY.

32:09.598 --> 32:12.471
Scott: YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET ME
TALK TO THE CONSUL? FINE.

32:12.471 --> 32:14.974
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOUR BOSS HAS DONE.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.646
HE TOOK A PAYOFF
TO SHIP A WORTHLESS VACCINE,

32:17.646 --> 32:19.728
AND NOW THOUSANDS
OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

32:19.728 --> 32:21.610
HE WAS ONTO THE SCHEME.

32:21.610 --> 32:24.733
SO I CALLED GORDON SLOANE.

32:24.733 --> 32:26.986
HE TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY,

32:26.986 --> 32:29.828
THAT HE HAD A GUY
WHO COULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

32:29.828 --> 32:32.161
BUT I THOUGHT THAT MEANT HE WAS
GOING TO BRIBE THE REPORTER.

32:32.161 --> 32:35.494
I NEVER THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
HE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM.

32:39.748 --> 32:42.001
Brooks:
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.962
YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN CHARGE
MY CLIENT WITH TWO MURDERS

32:43.962 --> 32:45.844
BECAUSE OF
A COFFEE-STAINED CONTRACT

32:45.844 --> 32:47.676
THAT WAS REPLACED
WITH A CLEAN COPY?

32:47.676 --> 32:49.048
IT WASN'T A CLEAN COPY.

32:49.048 --> 32:51.220
IT WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT CONTRACT --

32:51.220 --> 32:52.891
ONE THE CONSUL
NEVER WOULD'VE SIGNED.

32:52.891 --> 32:54.973
REALLY?
THE CONSUL TELL YOU THAT?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.685
NO, YOUR CLIENT MADE SURE
THAT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE

32:56.685 --> 32:58.437
WHEN HE HAD
THE CONSUL KILLED.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.768
THIS IS ABSURD.

32:59.768 --> 33:01.100

AT A SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

33:01.100 --> 33:02.651
WHEN THE CONSUL WAS KILLED.

33:02.651 --> 33:04.563
THERE WAS AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE
WHO SAW HIM THERE.

33:04.563 --> 33:05.694
IT'S A MEANINGLESS ALIBI.

33:05.694 --> 33:07.106
YOU TOLD RASHID

33:07.106 --> 33:09.108
THAT YOU HAD A GUY
WHO COULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

33:09.108 --> 33:10.699
YOU HIRED A PROFESSIONAL.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.281
WE DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO THIS.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.662

WE'RE GONNA TURN YOU OVER
TO THE BANGLADESHIS.

33:19.538 --> 33:21.460

TO STAND IN THEIR WAY.

FOR YOUR CASE TO COME TO TRIAL.

AND ALL THAT TIME, YOU'LL BE
SITTING IN A BANGLADESHI PRISON.

33:41.140 --> 33:44.233
MUST BE ALL KINDS OF DISEASES
YOU COULD CATCH IN THERE.

33:44.233 --> 33:47.066

VACCINATIONS ARE UP TO DATE.

33:49.148 --> 33:50.739
CAN THEY DO THAT?

33:51.820 --> 33:53.242

YOUR CLIENT GIVES US THE NAME
OF THE KILLER HE HIRED

34:00.789 --> 34:03.162
AND PLEADS GUILTY
TO SOLICITATION FOR MURDER.

TAKE A FEW MINUTES?

A PRETTY DECENT SHOT.

ADD UP.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.604

THE CONSUL HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE SCHEME.

WHY DID SLOANE KILL HIM?

34:30.779 --> 34:33.492

MY PLACE TO SAY, BUT...

39:38.587 --> 39:40.959
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TELL HER
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.462
W--

39:47.265 --> 39:49.267
[ SCOFFS ] I --

39:49.267 --> 39:52.350
Daniel: THE POETS TELL US
TO LISTEN TO OUR HEART.

39:52.350 --> 39:53.391
WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.063
[ LAUGHTER ]
SERIOUSLY.

39:55.063 --> 39:57.395
HAVE YOU EVER LISTENED TO ONE
THROUGH A STETHOSCOPE?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.107
IT'S JUST VALVES
OPENING AND CLOSING

39:59.107 --> 40:00.228
AND OPENING AND CLOSING.

40:00.228 --> 40:01.900
IT SOUNDS LIKE A SUMP PUMP.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.693
IT MAY FEEL LIKE
OUR EMOTIONS ARE DOWN HERE,

40:04.693 --> 40:06.404
BUT THEY'RE REALLY UP HERE,

40:06.404 --> 40:08.867
KNOCKING AROUND
OUR LIMBIC SYSTEMS.

40:08.867 --> 40:12.330
WHEN WE FACE THE HARD DECISIONS,
WE OFTEN HAVE TO CHOOSE

40:12.330 --> 40:16.665
BETWEEN THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
AND THE RATIONAL ONE.

40:16.665 --> 40:21.039
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
IT SEEMS EMOTION WINS THE DAY.

40:21.039 --> 40:24.092
SOME OF US ACT OUT OF GREED.

40:27.255 --> 40:31.850
OTHERS ARE MOTIVATED
BY RAGE OR REVENGE.

40:35.013 --> 40:37.936
SO, IF OUR FEELINGS
ARE THAT DESTRUCTIVE,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.438
MAYBE IT'S BETTER
IF WE HIDE THEM --

40:40.438 --> 40:45.113
TAMP THEM DOWN,
KEEP THEM FROM BOILING OVER.

40:45.113 --> 40:46.485
MAYBE.

40:47.826 --> 40:52.240
BUT CAN WE REALLY
DENY OUR EMOTIONS FOREVER?

41:19.558 --> 41:21.650
SOONER OR LATER,

41:21.650 --> 41:24.482
WILL THEY BUBBLE
TO THE SURFACE...

41:24.482 --> 41:26.695
AND FORCE US TO ACT?
