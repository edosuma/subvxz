People, people!
Paratis loved the pitch.

01:57.052 --> 01:59.719
Sydney, your patter
was perfection. Lauren,

01:59.721 --> 02:01.671
killer smile, killer
dance moves. Andrew,

02:01.673 --> 02:03.890
way to not take focus

If HR wasn't such a buzz kill,

I'd sleep with you. But
that'd be sleeping with me,

which I already do. Whoa,
where am I going with this?

02:12.401 --> 02:13.349
This is a little weird.

02:13.351 --> 02:15.035
We never know. But...
I know.

02:15.037 --> 02:17.654
Guess what. You were nominated
for an Advertising Impact Award,

02:17.656 --> 02:20.373
Creative of the Year. ANDREW:
Wow, you haven't been

02:20.375 --> 02:21.858
nominated for that since 2010.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.493
Creative of the Year.
That's so exciting.

02:23.495 --> 02:24.461
Who am I gonna wear?

02:24.463 --> 02:26.212
Who else is nominated?

02:26.214 --> 02:30.917
Uh, let me see. Uh, Gary Stein,
Josh Hayes, Susan Rogers,

02:30.919 --> 02:34.804
Josh Hayes.
You said him twice.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.257
Josh and I went
to high school together.

02:37.259 --> 02:38.675
Oh... Oh... Oh...

02:38.677 --> 02:40.977
It wasn't like that.
We barely knew each other.

02:40.979 --> 02:42.378
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay, sure.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.598
Nothing happened.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.434
Okay, maybe I had
a little crush on him.

02:47.436 --> 02:48.818
Yeah. Yeah. <i>Only</i>

02:48.820 --> 02:49.736
from afar.

02:49.738 --> 02:51.972
So, you never...
No.

02:51.974 --> 02:54.441
But you would've. If you had the
chance Oh, yeah. In a second.

02:54.443 --> 02:57.164
So you're a dirty little girl. Yes.
Wait. What did I just say yes to?

02:58.029 --> 02:59.729
My father was nominated
for an award!

02:59.731 --> 03:01.448
Oh, thank God. No one's
talked about me for a minute.

03:01.450 --> 03:04.567
I forgot I was here. You know, we should
throw a cocktail party in his honor.

03:04.569 --> 03:06.369
Oh, no, no, please. I
don't want to make a fuss.

03:06.371 --> 03:07.921
Come on. It'll be fun.
And, you know,

03:07.923 --> 03:10.006
it might be a nice gesture
to the other nominees,

03:10.008 --> 03:11.424
who we should invite.

03:11.426 --> 03:12.509
Ah...
Ah...

03:17.765 --> 03:21.434
Paratis, little green pill
for erectile dysfunction. Go.

03:21.436 --> 03:23.436
How 'bout this? Just
because Grandma's retired,

03:23.438 --> 03:27.107
doesn't mean Grandpa gets to. Let
the only organ failure you have

03:27.109 --> 03:28.391
be your heart.

03:28.393 --> 03:30.360
Put a little pep-pep
in your pepaw's pee-pee.

03:30.362 --> 03:32.195
Paratis, finally something
old people will like

03:32.197 --> 03:34.564
as much as voting.
Hey, who rigged the erection?

03:34.566 --> 03:36.783
This old bag of bones
just grew one more.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.435
You may have forgotten where you're going,
but your penis knows which way is up.

03:39.437 --> 03:40.820
You may be 40 years' sober,
but tonight

03:40.822 --> 03:43.439
you're gonna end the night
with a stiff one. Yes.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.774
Just 'cause you guys high-five
at the end of a bad pitch

03:44.776 --> 03:45.992
doesn't make it a winner.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.877
- Are you sure?
- Ohh, you know what might help us?

03:47.879 --> 03:49.879
Someone with working knowledge
of this product.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.465
Hmm, you're right.
So, what's it like?

03:52.467 --> 03:54.300
Seriously.
What's it like?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.302
(chuckles)
I don't take Paratis.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.304
Regularly? On an empty stomach?
No, no,

03:58.306 --> 03:59.389
no, no, I've never
taken Paratis.

03:59.391 --> 04:00.557
I've never had a need to.

04:00.559 --> 04:02.291
Boss, we know.
We're just messing with you.

04:02.293 --> 04:03.893
I have a friend who does.
Maybe he can help us.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.345
Ah, a friend.
Yeah.

04:05.347 --> 04:06.179
My friend Simon.

04:06.181 --> 04:07.263
Simon.
Simon.

04:07.265 --> 04:08.431
You own it, boss.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.266
No, no, he's my friend
Simon Lancaster,

04:10.268 --> 04:12.268
completely different Simon.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.603
I'll prove to you
I'm not talking about myself.

04:13.605 --> 04:14.771
I'm a partner in this firm.
I have to prove to you

04:14.773 --> 04:15.739
I can still get an erection...

04:15.741 --> 04:17.072
No, no, no!
No, we believe you...

04:17.075 --> 04:18.858
Ah! Ah, ha-ha, wonderful,

04:18.860 --> 04:20.276
a phone.

04:20.278 --> 04:22.779
Simon Lancaster.

04:22.781 --> 04:24.147
It's going to voice mail.

04:24.149 --> 04:25.782
(clears throat)
Simon, it's Simon.

04:25.784 --> 04:29.202
Not you, me. (Chuckles)
Does that ever get old?

04:29.204 --> 04:31.504
(whispers): It's an inside joke. If you
got a second, could you call me back

04:31.506 --> 04:33.022
and tell my coworkers
about your troubles

04:33.024 --> 04:34.157
with erectile dysfunction?

04:34.159 --> 04:36.292
Thanks. See you
at group next week.

04:36.294 --> 04:40.180
Did that prove anything? Only that he doesn't
understand the rules of group therapy.

04:40.182 --> 04:42.015
I'm not an old man, and I don't
need a pill to prove it.

04:42.017 --> 04:43.433
Or an award, for that matter.

04:43.435 --> 04:45.268
What? Who said anything about an award?
Someone brought it up.

04:45.270 --> 04:47.587
I heard it. And I don't care
about awards. I never have.

04:47.589 --> 04:50.890
Awards. Don't need that
to prove my manhood.

04:50.892 --> 04:53.676
<i>C'est un honneur pour moi</i>
<i>d'être nominé.</i>

04:53.678 --> 04:57.647
(chuckles) And the winner is...
Simon Roberts.

04:57.649 --> 04:59.566
Whoa, whoa. Thank you, Charlize.

04:59.568 --> 05:01.901
Thank you. Wow.
Creative of the Year.

05:01.903 --> 05:03.853
Well, I'd like to dedicate
this award

05:03.855 --> 05:06.289
to my daughter Sydney,
who's up way past her bedtime.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.024
Honey, you can go to bed now.
Daddy's a winner!

05:08.026 --> 05:10.076
(whoops) No, come on, now.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.411
Wait a minute.
Who have I forgotten?

05:11.413 --> 05:13.463
Um, uh...
(mimics orchestra) Please.

05:13.465 --> 05:16.382
I'd like to thank my daughter,
my secret daughter,

05:16.384 --> 05:19.335
the Chilean miners, Hilary
Swank's husband, my ex-wives

05:19.337 --> 05:21.221
'cause without them I
could've retired years ago.

05:21.223 --> 05:22.422
Thank you!
Go, Chicago!

05:22.424 --> 05:25.725
(whoops) You're so good
at accepting awards.

05:25.727 --> 05:27.477
You must really want this.

05:27.479 --> 05:28.812
It's not just an award.
It's something else I can pawn

05:28.814 --> 05:29.746
if I relapse.

05:29.748 --> 05:31.014
Besides, what else
am I gonna put

05:31.016 --> 05:32.982
on my shelves?
Pictures of my grandkids?

05:32.984 --> 05:34.517
Like that's ever gonna happen.

05:34.519 --> 05:36.886
I won the Junior Miss Orlando
Pageant, but only because

05:36.888 --> 05:38.888
I put eyedrops
in Becky Johnston's Diet Coke

05:38.890 --> 05:40.073
before the swimsuit round.

05:40.075 --> 05:41.741
(chuckles) So you get it.

05:41.743 --> 05:43.109
(sighs) Well,

05:43.111 --> 05:44.778
you know, every day
when I come here,

05:44.780 --> 05:47.363
I see that likeness of me
on the wall and...

05:47.365 --> 05:49.565
I come face-to-face
with somebody I used to be.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.835
Every now and then
I want something, you know,

05:51.837 --> 05:54.420
that's a "now moment,"
something from me, you know?

05:54.422 --> 05:56.206
Something special,
you know what I mean?

05:56.208 --> 05:58.574
Not really but I'm using
context clues to figure it out.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.044
You want to feel like
you're still relevant. Mmm.

06:01.046 --> 06:04.297
Like you're not just part
of the past but also the now.

06:04.299 --> 06:06.266
Exactly.

06:06.268 --> 06:08.601
Don't you wish
there was a green pill for that?

06:08.603 --> 06:09.853
But you just landed
a big account.

06:09.855 --> 06:11.271
Yeah, but awards are what
reminds people of that,

06:11.273 --> 06:13.723
you know? That's how you get
your next big account.

06:13.725 --> 06:17.143
Can I pitch an idea? I mean,
I know I'm just an assistant...

06:17.145 --> 06:19.145
You're not just an assistant.
You're a smart, powerful woman

06:19.147 --> 06:21.231
who made a teenage girl
crap her bikini. Go on.

06:21.233 --> 06:23.149
Well, we all know
how good you are.

06:23.151 --> 06:25.451
Oh, please. Maybe you need
to remind the judges.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.271
So if you want to win
this award, campaign for it.

06:28.273 --> 06:30.573
What do you mean?
Like, take out an ad?

06:30.575 --> 06:33.126
Or a billboard placed in
key locations around the city

06:33.128 --> 06:34.794
so the judges have to see it?

06:34.796 --> 06:36.546
That seems unseemly.

06:36.548 --> 06:37.580
You love unseemly.

06:37.582 --> 06:39.132
I do. What have you got?

06:39.134 --> 06:40.166
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

06:40.168 --> 06:40.967
Mm-hmm.

06:40.969 --> 06:42.118
You as a superhero...

06:42.120 --> 06:43.052
Oh, like Ad Man.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.838
...literally making an impact

06:44.840 --> 06:46.606
and all the brands you've
worked on over the years

06:46.608 --> 06:49.409
are scattered outside the
crater you've made. Wow.

06:49.411 --> 06:51.094
It's amazing, Lauren.
You've been holding out on us.

06:51.096 --> 06:54.264
If I'm not careful, you're gonna
be taking over this company.

06:54.266 --> 06:56.132
How would I do that? Poison you?

06:56.134 --> 06:59.302
Stage a coup on Sydney, who'd be
too emotionally distraught

06:59.304 --> 07:00.937
to see it coming?

07:00.939 --> 07:03.773
(chuckling)

07:07.278 --> 07:08.778
(sniffs)

07:09.613 --> 07:11.915
Keeping an eye on her.

07:16.453 --> 07:20.340
Hey, Syd, the DJ needs to know
where to set up for the... Wow.

07:20.342 --> 07:22.792
You look great.

07:22.794 --> 07:24.427
You know,

07:24.429 --> 07:26.546
if you were a woman, I'd be
very attracted to you.

07:26.548 --> 07:29.132
First of all,
you're talking to a partner.

07:29.134 --> 07:30.800
And secondly,

07:30.802 --> 07:32.218
sure it's okay?

07:32.220 --> 07:33.052
It's perfect.

07:33.054 --> 07:35.221
Andrew!
Get in here!

07:35.223 --> 07:37.840
You are not gonna believe this.
Hey, Syd...

07:37.842 --> 07:40.226
Whoa, something is different
here. Don't tell me.

07:40.228 --> 07:42.645
Don't tell me.
Is that a new lamp?

07:42.647 --> 07:45.398
Why is it so hard for you freaks
to tell me I look nice?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.816
I'm sorry. That was meant
to be a compliment.

07:46.818 --> 07:48.952
Just my... mouth
wouldn't let me say it.

07:48.954 --> 07:50.954
(sighs)
Fine, I know this is ridiculous.

07:50.956 --> 07:52.705
Josh probably won't even
remember me.

07:52.707 --> 07:55.024
ZACH: No, it's not ridiculous.
We all had that special person.

07:55.026 --> 07:58.127
("Eternal Flame" playing) in high school, right?
The one who got away.

07:58.129 --> 08:02.081
Even you? No, I got them
all, but I feel cheated.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.500
Well, mine was Josh Hayes,

08:04.502 --> 08:07.420
and I was so in love with him
I couldn't even look at him.

08:07.422 --> 08:09.339
He was a total package,

08:09.341 --> 08:12.225
track star, class president,
mathlete.

08:12.227 --> 08:14.727
Oh, so you bought a snow globe
that plays "Eternal Flame"

08:14.729 --> 08:16.980
to remind you of a guy
you were too afraid to talk to?

08:16.982 --> 08:20.400
When I hear it out loud,
it almost sounds irrational.

08:20.402 --> 08:21.484
No, it sounds completely...

08:21.486 --> 08:23.486
She's having a moment.
...sweet.

08:23.488 --> 08:26.072
In my fantasy,
I'm standing at my locker

08:26.074 --> 08:27.907
and then I hear
someone say my name,

08:27.909 --> 08:30.243
and when I turn around,
it's Josh.

08:30.245 --> 08:32.445
And before I can think
of something witty

08:32.447 --> 08:35.865
and perfect to say,
he kisses me,

08:35.866 --> 08:38.201
right there front of everyone.

08:38.203 --> 08:40.370
And then...

08:40.371 --> 08:42.371
it starts to snow,

08:42.374 --> 08:44.540
and then we start dancing

08:44.542 --> 08:46.926
just like this.

08:46.928 --> 08:48.962
It's snowing inside
your high school?

08:48.964 --> 08:50.413
It was probably asbestos.

08:50.415 --> 08:52.415
(music stops) Seriously,
Syd, we're kidding.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.717
You look awesome. Yeah,
you're gonna knock him dead.

08:54.719 --> 08:56.853
It looks cold in there. You'd
think that snow globe guy

08:56.855 --> 08:58.054
would've given you his scarf.

08:58.056 --> 08:59.072
ANDREW: Scarf? If she
doesn't put out,

08:59.074 --> 09:02.258
she'll be lucky
to get a ride home.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.760
Hey-o!

09:04.762 --> 09:07.196
Why do I even share?

09:08.477 --> 09:12.012
♪

09:15.000 --> 09:17.268
♪

09:21.456 --> 09:23.691
♪

09:26.828 --> 09:29.480
So I'm down to one testicle.
But you know what they say,

09:29.482 --> 09:31.615
anything more
than a handful's a waste!

09:31.617 --> 09:33.334
Oh, Bud, I could hear you talk
about your ball all night.

09:33.336 --> 09:35.002
Sydney, do you need me
for anything?

09:35.004 --> 09:37.088
What? And take you away
from Bud? Never.

09:37.090 --> 09:38.289
How are you, Syd?

09:38.291 --> 09:39.590
Here's one for
the record books,

09:39.592 --> 09:43.677
my replacement knee
got cancer. (Laughs)

09:43.679 --> 09:45.963
(laughing): I'm just laughing
'cause I'm really uncomfortable.

09:45.965 --> 09:47.381
This is fun!

09:47.383 --> 09:49.884
I haven't been invited to
a nominee party in years.

09:49.886 --> 09:51.385
Well, you weren't invited
to this one.

09:51.387 --> 09:52.436
'Cause I wasn't nominated!

09:52.438 --> 09:53.471
(laughs)

09:53.473 --> 09:55.389
Now I'm uncomfortable.
Ooh,

09:55.391 --> 09:57.475
those sliders are
calling my name.

09:57.477 --> 09:58.976
Side effect of the meds!

09:58.978 --> 10:00.561
(laughs)

10:00.563 --> 10:02.346
Bang... still got it.

10:02.348 --> 10:04.281
(laughs)

10:04.283 --> 10:06.233
No, you don't.
(sighs)

10:06.235 --> 10:07.368
Boy, he's got ball.

10:07.370 --> 10:08.536
Whew.

10:08.538 --> 10:10.821
Not the most uplifting
guy but a great kisser.

10:10.823 --> 10:13.157
Your mother and I made
out with him and his wife

10:13.159 --> 10:14.658
at a key party in the '70s.

10:14.660 --> 10:16.710
Oh, she was a trooper, boy.

10:16.712 --> 10:19.130
Out of curiosity, have you
ever left anything unsaid?

10:19.132 --> 10:21.165
No.

10:21.167 --> 10:22.633
What are you staring at?

10:22.635 --> 10:23.667
Do you think that's me

10:23.669 --> 10:25.636
in a couple of years?

10:25.638 --> 10:27.004
Is Bud my Ghost of
Christmas Future?

10:27.006 --> 10:29.706
SYDNEY: Dad, this whole
party is for you.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.041
You're nominated for an Impact.

10:31.043 --> 10:33.260
Yeah, 'cause I'm at the
top of my game today,

10:33.262 --> 10:34.478
but what about tomorrow?

10:34.480 --> 10:35.546
We have a staff meeting.

10:35.548 --> 10:37.264
At least I have
that to live for.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.733
You know, maybe I am the old
man in the Paratis pitch.

10:39.735 --> 10:41.652
You know, maybe I should
step aside and make way

10:41.654 --> 10:43.604
for all the Zachs
and the Joshes.

10:43.606 --> 10:45.322
Is that why you're campaigning
for this award?

10:45.324 --> 10:46.524
Yeah, it's stupid, right?

10:46.526 --> 10:47.491
Yes.

10:47.493 --> 10:48.526
Yeah.

10:48.528 --> 10:49.910
But I guess it's no more stupid

10:49.912 --> 10:51.529
than getting all dressed up

10:51.531 --> 10:54.165
for some guy who barely knew
I existed in high school.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.083
Come on, now, you look pretty.

10:56.085 --> 10:57.234
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

10:57.236 --> 10:58.419
You know what?
Let's just give ourselves

10:58.421 --> 11:00.671
permission to be stupid and go for it.
I'm glad

11:00.673 --> 11:02.506
you said that 'cause the bus
ads have all been paid for.

11:02.508 --> 11:04.258
A few billboards but
that's as far as I've gone.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.459
Simon, the blimp's
not available.

11:05.461 --> 11:06.927
Because the blimp
wasn't available.

11:06.929 --> 11:08.345
JOSH:
Sydney.

11:08.347 --> 11:10.414
SYDNEY:
Josh.

11:10.416 --> 11:13.100
ALL:
Oh...

11:13.102 --> 11:14.435
Go for it, just don't
get pregnant... or do.

11:14.437 --> 11:16.187
My grandfather
clock is ticking.

11:16.189 --> 11:17.521
Hi.

11:17.523 --> 11:19.773
Wow, you look amazing.

11:19.775 --> 11:21.758
It's been a long time.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.594
Yeah, how long has it been?

11:23.596 --> 11:26.197
You want the answer in years,
months, days, or minutes?

11:26.199 --> 11:27.364
(laughs, snorts)

11:27.366 --> 11:29.116
Was that a harbor seal?
I heard horse.

11:29.118 --> 11:30.534
So, I know you're
up against my dad,

11:30.536 --> 11:32.653
but congratulations
on your nomination.

11:32.655 --> 11:34.488
Oh, thank you.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.123
Okay, uh, don't be offended,

11:36.125 --> 11:38.292
but, uh, I need
to keep a promise

11:38.294 --> 11:40.494
I made to myself 18 years ago.

11:40.496 --> 11:42.830
Okay.

11:46.051 --> 11:47.067
Whoa.

11:47.069 --> 11:48.319
We can just do that now?

11:48.321 --> 11:50.821
Oh, he can.

11:50.823 --> 11:52.172
I'm sorry.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.725
That was the defining moment I
meant to have in high school.

11:54.727 --> 11:56.644
Yeah, that moment
has actually been redefined

11:56.646 --> 11:58.295
as sexual assault.
Bye.

11:58.297 --> 11:59.847
Would you like to dance?
Yes.

11:59.849 --> 12:03.017
I-I mean, sure, I mean,
we're, we're both here,

12:03.019 --> 12:04.602
so we might as well.

12:04.604 --> 12:06.987
Okay.

12:06.989 --> 12:09.773
There's something about
that guy I do not like.

12:09.775 --> 12:11.808
Is it his full lips
or his dreamy eyes?

12:11.810 --> 12:14.811
Okay, be honest,
was that kiss weird?

12:14.813 --> 12:16.580
Because the cabdriver said
it would work.

12:16.582 --> 12:18.165
(chuckles)

12:18.167 --> 12:21.952
I-I have to say, this is all
kind of blowing my mind.

12:21.954 --> 12:23.370
You wanted to kiss me?

12:23.372 --> 12:26.707
I had a crush on you; you
didn't even notice me.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.792
Are you kidding me? Every time
I tried to get your attention,

12:28.794 --> 12:30.494
you would run the other way...

12:30.496 --> 12:32.212
one time
even into a trophy case.

12:32.214 --> 12:34.181
Yeah, that was emotionally
and physically scarring.

12:34.183 --> 12:35.165
I just thought

12:35.167 --> 12:37.468
you were a little stuck-up
or something.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.686
Me, stuck-up?

12:38.688 --> 12:40.170
I was a dork.

12:40.172 --> 12:43.440
You, you were voted "most
likely to stay awesome."

12:43.442 --> 12:45.342
Two years running.
(chuckles)

12:45.344 --> 12:47.945
Yeah, I pretty much had it all.

12:48.813 --> 12:50.981
Except for one thing.

12:55.287 --> 12:57.538
♪

13:02.827 --> 13:04.461
So, you've been spending
a lot of time with this guy.

13:04.463 --> 13:05.546
Two amazing dates

13:05.548 --> 13:08.048
and then all weekend
we binge-watched <i>Bones.</i>

13:08.050 --> 13:10.634
Sweetheart, I'm your father,
that's TMI.

13:10.636 --> 13:12.419
I really like Josh.
Mm.

13:12.421 --> 13:13.837
He's smart and he's funny

13:13.839 --> 13:15.889
and a thief.

13:15.891 --> 13:17.341
I get it, he stole your heart,

13:17.343 --> 13:19.059
but that's a little corny
even for you.

13:19.061 --> 13:20.144
The...

13:20.146 --> 13:21.895
That's my...

13:21.897 --> 13:23.397
How did...?

13:23.399 --> 13:24.648
Oh, God.
What?

13:24.650 --> 13:27.184
I might have mentioned
your ad to Josh.

13:27.186 --> 13:28.769
There was wine
and, I don't know,

13:28.771 --> 13:31.021
something about eight hours
of <i>Bones</i> that loosens you up.

13:31.023 --> 13:33.357
Geez, Sydney,
don't make this worse.

13:33.359 --> 13:34.391
You know what?
What?

13:34.393 --> 13:36.076
I-I bet it's
just a joke.

13:36.078 --> 13:37.778
Uh-huh. I mean, he knows
we walk this way to work.

13:37.780 --> 13:39.029
He probably bribed
the bus driver

13:39.031 --> 13:40.397
to play a practical joke.

13:40.399 --> 13:42.566
Right?
Yeah.

13:42.568 --> 13:43.784
That's what he did, he just...

13:49.341 --> 13:52.543
Or not.

13:52.545 --> 13:54.345
(elevator bell dings)

13:54.347 --> 13:56.797
Excuse me,
you're here to see...

13:56.799 --> 13:58.749
A bastard named Josh
Hayes. Out of my way.

14:02.053 --> 14:03.187
Why isn't this working?

14:03.189 --> 14:04.755
I ballroom danced in college.

14:06.775 --> 14:07.808
(grunts)

14:07.810 --> 14:08.809
Aah!

14:08.811 --> 14:11.478
Oh, co...

14:11.480 --> 14:13.897
These were new shoes.

14:16.534 --> 14:17.934
You betrayed me.

14:17.936 --> 14:19.286
You stole my father's idea.

14:19.288 --> 14:20.404
You are not at all

14:20.406 --> 14:22.105
the person that I make-believe
fell in love with.

14:22.107 --> 14:23.957
You do not deserve to be the
father of Taylor and Jayden,

14:23.959 --> 14:25.409
our fictitious children
who are high achievers

14:25.411 --> 14:27.110
with the ability to sleep
at night without medication.

14:27.112 --> 14:30.881
Sydney... have you met
the gang from Charmin?

14:33.785 --> 14:36.837
Not yet, but I believe
we're pitching you next week.

14:36.839 --> 14:39.590
We have some bold ideas,
so stay tuned.

14:44.012 --> 14:45.429
Sydney.

14:45.431 --> 14:48.632
Just tell me one thing...
was any of it real?

14:48.634 --> 14:50.517
Was <i>Bones</i> just a lie? I
mean, do you even like

14:50.519 --> 14:52.135
David Boreanaz, or
was it all just a con

14:52.137 --> 14:53.303
to steal my father's idea?

14:53.305 --> 14:55.806
JOSH: It was all real...
this week, high school.

14:55.808 --> 14:57.274
Come on, you said
an assistant came up with it.

14:57.276 --> 14:58.742
I didn't think
you were going to use it.

14:58.744 --> 15:00.077
That doesn't give you
permission to steal.

15:00.079 --> 15:01.829
Even if I did,
it's advertising.

15:01.831 --> 15:05.082
We steal all the time
and call it inspiration.

15:05.084 --> 15:06.784
This is kind of who we are.

15:06.786 --> 15:09.002
It's not who I am.

15:09.004 --> 15:10.454
Syd, I am so sorry.

15:10.456 --> 15:13.624
I actually thought
you might be impressed.

15:13.626 --> 15:15.793
There are a lot of ways
to impress me, Josh.

15:15.795 --> 15:18.128
Screwing over my father is
not one of the better ones.

15:18.130 --> 15:20.330
See you soon!

15:20.332 --> 15:22.132
See you never.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:32.158 --> 15:35.577
Hey, kiddo, sorry about
Josh stealing your idea.

15:35.579 --> 15:37.412
The worst part is,
he got the blimp.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.581
Not the blimp.
How does she look?

15:39.583 --> 15:42.384
Not good... she really phoned
in the eye shadow today.

15:42.386 --> 15:44.219
What? Oh, you meant emotionally.

15:44.221 --> 15:46.388
Yeah. I think she feels
as bad as her makeup.

15:46.390 --> 15:48.306
Really? I always told
her, "Make a choice..."

15:48.308 --> 15:50.041
"either smoky eyes
and a natural lip

15:50.043 --> 15:51.542
"or red lips and simple eyes.

15:51.544 --> 15:53.562
You can't do both."

15:53.564 --> 15:55.063
Poor girl.

15:55.065 --> 15:57.432
(breathing heavily)

15:57.434 --> 15:58.650
Whoa, hey.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.769
This isn't over.

16:00.771 --> 16:03.104
Ah?
I called our attorneys.

16:03.106 --> 16:06.074
We're gonna sue Josh and
the agency and the bus company.

16:06.076 --> 16:07.725
You called our attorneys?
That's 75 bucks.

16:07.727 --> 16:09.361
MAN (over phone):
$150.

16:09.363 --> 16:10.312
I've been on for 15 minutes.

16:10.314 --> 16:11.363
Hey, Marty, bill us.

16:11.365 --> 16:12.447
Love to the wife and girlfriend.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.915
(clicks) Hey,

16:13.917 --> 16:17.085
I'm sorry about Josh.

16:17.087 --> 16:19.004
(sighs)

16:19.006 --> 16:21.172
I just feel so silly.

16:21.174 --> 16:22.674
At least the bag covered
the bright lips, huh?

16:22.676 --> 16:23.676
I don't care what you say.

16:23.677 --> 16:25.293
I think you can do both.

16:25.295 --> 16:27.012
Hmm.

16:27.014 --> 16:29.180
Dad, I really liked him.

16:29.182 --> 16:31.132
I know, hey, hey, come on now,

16:31.134 --> 16:33.268
and it sucks when things don't
turn out the way we imagined.

16:33.270 --> 16:35.136
It's like seeing
the Easter Bunny

16:35.138 --> 16:36.938
on a smoke break with
his in head in one hand

16:36.940 --> 16:39.524
and a menthol in the other,
going, "Happy Easter",

16:39.526 --> 16:40.758
you know."
(chuckles)

16:40.760 --> 16:43.395
But... okay,

16:43.397 --> 16:46.031
("Eternal Flame" playing)
so maybe he's not this guy,

16:46.033 --> 16:50.601
but this guy... he's
still out there.

16:51.954 --> 16:54.205
Yeah, you know what else
is still out there for you?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.490
What?
An Impact award.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.741
No.
I can feel it.

16:56.743 --> 16:58.376
You're gonna win.

16:58.378 --> 16:59.661
(chuckles)

17:00.830 --> 17:03.948
SIMON: <i>Well, it would have been</i>
<i>nice to have won, but...</i>

17:03.950 --> 17:06.635
(à la Jack Nicholson): ...it was
an honor just to be nominated.

17:06.637 --> 17:09.637
Take that Impact award
and put it between your knees.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.805
(all laugh)

17:10.807 --> 17:13.308
Okay, guys, how about
a toast to Lauren

17:13.310 --> 17:14.791
and her award-winning idea?

17:14.794 --> 17:17.646
Thank you, I just wish
it didn't help Josh win.

17:17.647 --> 17:19.431
It's just more proof
that it was a good idea.

17:19.433 --> 17:20.482
Wait, and to my dad,

17:20.483 --> 17:22.317
who may not have won
an Impact today

17:22.319 --> 17:24.602
but who makes an impact
on all of us every day.

17:24.604 --> 17:26.488
Bless you, piglet,
when you say it like that,

17:26.490 --> 17:27.821
I don't feel like such a loser.

17:27.824 --> 17:29.741
Loser? We got gift bags.

17:29.743 --> 17:30.992
I don't know,
they're pretty lame.

17:30.994 --> 17:33.695
We got, uh, stickers
and a sample size

17:33.697 --> 17:35.146
of Nivea hand cream.

17:35.148 --> 17:36.781
Yeah, that's stupid. Here, let
me throw that out for you.

17:36.783 --> 17:37.866
SIMON:
And I have a DVD

17:37.868 --> 17:39.868
of the first season
of <i>Tabatha Takes Over.</i>

17:39.870 --> 17:41.453
Here, I'll throw that out, too.
(whistles)

17:41.455 --> 17:42.454
Now?

17:42.456 --> 17:45.423
Now is the perfect time.

17:45.425 --> 17:46.458
Wait, what-what's
happening?

17:46.460 --> 17:47.492
LAUREN AND SIMON:
Nothing.

17:47.494 --> 17:48.626
Nothing's happening.

17:48.628 --> 17:50.178
Zach's just cold.

17:50.180 --> 17:53.098
(playing "Eternal Flame"
on piano)

17:53.100 --> 17:55.433
I love this song.

17:55.435 --> 17:56.384
This is my song.

17:56.386 --> 17:58.970
What are you doing?

17:58.972 --> 18:01.506
May I have this dance?

18:01.508 --> 18:03.191
