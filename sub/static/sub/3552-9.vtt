WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:03.674
RENEE CONFRONTED LYNETTE.

00:03.674 --> 00:08.079
LOOK, YOU AND TOM TRIED TO MAKE
IT WORK, AND YOU COULDN'T.

00:08.079 --> 00:09.310
NOW HE'S MOVED ON.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.542
CARLOS AGREED TO GO INTO REHAB.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.145
I KNOW A GREAT PLACE.
I CAN CALL TOMORROW.

00:14.145 --> 00:17.088
SUSAN'S SECRET WORK OF ART...

00:17.088 --> 00:18.619
NO ONE CAN SEE THESE!

00:18.619 --> 00:21.052
FUELED
THE DETECTIVE'S SUSPICIONS...

00:21.052 --> 00:23.654
ALL I SEE IS FOUR WOMEN
THAT KILLED A GUY

00:23.654 --> 00:25.156
WITH A CANDLESTICK

00:25.156 --> 00:27.058
AND DUMPED HIS BODY
IN THE WOODS.

00:27.058 --> 00:30.201
AND DROVE A WEDGE
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

00:30.201 --> 00:32.162
MORESECRETS? (scoffs)

00:32.162 --> 00:34.505
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE DOING?
 I WAS PROTECTING YOU!

00:34.505 --> 00:36.607
YEAH, WELL, GREAT JOB.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.469
(sighs)

00:43.314 --> 00:45.076
(Mary Alice)
WHENEVER BREE VAN DE KAMP

00:45.076 --> 00:47.648
WAS FEELING LOW...

00:47.648 --> 00:51.522
SHE FOUND SOLACE
IN THE ACT OF BAKING.

00:53.224 --> 00:57.128
WHEN HER FIRST HUSBAND
PASSED AWAY,

00:57.128 --> 00:59.730
SHE MADE COFFEE CAKE.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.063
WHEN HER SECOND HUSBAND
WENT TO JAIL,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.237
SHE MADE SUGAR COOKIES.

01:06.237 --> 01:10.341
AND WHEN HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER
GOT PREGNANT,

01:10.341 --> 01:13.104
SHE MADE CREME BRULEE.

01:13.104 --> 01:17.148
SO WHEN BREE'S BEST FRIENDS
STOPPED SPEAKING TO HER,

01:17.148 --> 01:20.651
SHE HOPED THAT
HER WARM CHERRY SCONES

01:20.651 --> 01:24.255
MIGHT THAW
THEIR CHILLY RELATIONSHIP.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.089
SUSAN.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.604
HEY, SWEETIE.
IS YOUR MOM HOME?

01:43.604 --> 01:46.507
UH, NO. SHE'S AT... CHURCH.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.280
ON A THURSDAY?

01:49.280 --> 01:51.442
SHE TOLD YOU TO SAY THAT,
DIDN'T SHE?

01:51.442 --> 01:53.584
ONLY IF IT WAS YOU.
IF IT WAS THE PRIEST,

01:53.584 --> 01:56.217
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY
SHE'S READING TO THE BLIND.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.797
(lowered voice)
WILL YOU STOP POUNDING?

02:06.797 --> 02:08.899
I JUST PUT PAIGE DOWN.

02:08.899 --> 02:11.862
I'M SORRY,
BUT NO ONE WILL TALK TO ME.

02:11.862 --> 02:14.235
REALLY?
I WONDER WHY THAT IS.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.706
LOOK, I HAVE MADE
A MESS OF THINGS,

02:15.706 --> 02:18.309
BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU ALL.

02:18.309 --> 02:21.612
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN BAKE
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE?

02:21.612 --> 02:23.274
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S JUST A PEACE OFFERING,

02:23.274 --> 02:25.316
A WAY
TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION.

02:25.316 --> 02:26.717
I HAVE NOTHING TO DISCUSS
WITH YOU,

02:26.717 --> 02:29.180
NOT AFTER THE WAY
YOU AND GABY LIED TO ME.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.481
LYNETTE, PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

02:30.481 --> 02:32.753
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, ALL OF YOU.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.526
NO! YOU WERE TRYING
TO CONTROL US

02:35.526 --> 02:38.759
THE WAY YOU TRY AND CONTROL
 EVERYTHING.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.160
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.233
YOU TOLD US THAT AS LONG
AS WE TRUSTED EACH OTHER

02:42.233 --> 02:45.296
AND STUCK TOGETHER,
EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.

02:45.296 --> 02:47.498
IT WILL BE. AS LONG
AS WE HAVE OUR FRIENDSHIP,

02:47.498 --> 02:49.770
THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO US.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.273
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THERE IS NO US.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.175
THERE IS NO FRIENDSHIP.
NOT ANYMORE.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.778
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.610
WE ALL ARE.

03:04.315 --> 03:09.820
YES, BREE HAD ALWAYS
TAKEN COMFORT IN BAKING.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.494
BUT WHEN BAKING FAILED HER,

03:13.494 --> 03:17.368
SHE TOOK COMFORT
IN SOMETHING ELSE.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.743
IN A PLACE AS PEACEFUL
AS WISTERIA LANE,

03:32.743 --> 03:37.388
THE SMALLEST CRIME CAN PROMPT
A CALL TO THE POLICE...

03:37.388 --> 03:41.221
WHEN A NEIGHBORHOOD KID MAKES
A RECKLESS MISTAKE...

03:41.221 --> 03:43.394
(beeps)

03:43.394 --> 03:46.827
WHEN CHILDREN NEED
TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON...

03:46.827 --> 03:48.359
(beeps)

03:49.360 --> 03:51.332
(drum playing)

03:51.332 --> 03:54.405
WHEN THE TEENAGERS NEXT DOOR
START A BAND.

03:54.405 --> 03:55.636
(beeps)

03:55.636 --> 03:58.339
YES, THE WOMEN OF WISTERIA LANE

03:58.339 --> 04:00.471
WERE USED TO
CALLING THE POLICE.

04:00.471 --> 04:06.377
WHAT THEY WEREN'T USED TO WAS
HAVING THE POLICE...CALL THEM.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.619
SO... WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:08.619 --> 04:10.020
NOT SURE.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.682
NO ONE'S TALKED TO US YET.

04:11.682 --> 04:14.254
DO YOU THINK WE NEED A LAWYER?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.257
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SUSAN
CAN PAINT ONE FOR US.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.990
LAWYERS WON'T BE NECESSARY,
LADIES.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.393
THIS IS NOT
AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION.

04:22.393 --> 04:25.396
IT'S JUST A--IT'S JUST A CASUAL
CONVERSATION AMONG FRIENDS.

04:25.396 --> 04:26.797
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BRING LAWYERS
INTO IT,

04:26.797 --> 04:29.870
I CAN OPEN A CASE FILE,
TAKE YOUR FINGERPRINTS.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.803
NO. NO.
WE LIKE THE FRIEND THING.

04:32.803 --> 04:37.308
GREAT. SO THE FIRST FRIEND
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO IS... SUSAN.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.783
TRY MY COFFEE.

04:44.855 --> 04:47.518
THE GUYS ARE ALWAYS
COMPLIMENTING ME ON IT.

04:47.518 --> 04:50.691
THANKS. I'M TRYING TO CUT DOWN
ON CAFFEINE.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.464
GETS YOU ALL JITTERY
AND NERVOUS?

04:53.464 --> 04:54.525
YEAH. I HATE THAT.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.567
SO YOU FEELING JITTERY
AND NERVOUS RIGHT NOW?

04:56.567 --> 04:57.928
WHAT?

04:57.928 --> 04:59.370
N-NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
(chuckles)

05:03.474 --> 05:05.476
(slurps)

05:05.476 --> 05:07.438
UH, YUM.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.879
MY COMPLIMENTS.

05:12.843 --> 05:16.417
WHY'D YOU PAINT THIS?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.590
UH, WHY?

05:19.590 --> 05:22.022
IT'S... HARD TO SAY

05:22.022 --> 05:26.357
WHY ARTISTS...
PAINT WHAT THEY DO.

05:26.357 --> 05:30.531
GOSH, THAT PROBABLY SOUNDED
SO... ARTSY. (chuckles)

05:30.531 --> 05:32.403
NO, NOT REALLY.

05:32.403 --> 05:34.465
I WOULD IMAGINE
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE

05:34.465 --> 05:38.709
THAT THE ARTIST HERSELF DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW WHY SHE DID IT.

05:38.709 --> 05:43.674
SOMETIMES
YOU SAY TO YOURSELF...

05:43.674 --> 05:45.946
"WHERE THE HECK
DID THAT COME FROM?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.948
"MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN

05:47.948 --> 05:50.451
THAT PEPPERONI PIZZA
BEFORE BED."

05:50.451 --> 05:52.352
(chuckles)

05:52.352 --> 05:54.054
OR MAYBE YOU SAY TO YOURSELF,

05:54.054 --> 05:57.428
"I FEEL SO GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT I DID."

05:59.730 --> 06:02.393
I-I-I DON'T...

06:02.393 --> 06:04.565
I MEAN, WHO...
WHO IS THAT?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.397
THE GUY IN YOUR PAINTING.

06:06.397 --> 06:07.898
THE ONE IN THE GRAVE.

06:07.898 --> 06:09.600
NO.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.502
UH, UH, NO.

06:11.502 --> 06:14.004
THAT CAME
FROM MY IMAGINATION.

06:14.004 --> 06:15.706
BULL. IT'S HIM.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.648
RAMON SANCHEZ.

06:17.648 --> 06:20.110
A MISSING PERSON
FROM OKLAHOMA.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.414
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

06:23.414 --> 06:26.016
THAT ISN'T A PAINTING, SUSAN.

06:26.016 --> 06:28.759
IT'S A GUILTY CONSCIENCE
TRYING TO FIND PEACE,

06:28.759 --> 06:30.591
BUT IT NEVER WILL, EVER...

06:30.591 --> 06:33.393
UNTIL YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

06:35.766 --> 06:38.398
(Chuck) SO YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS GUY BEFORE?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.100
YOU ALREADY ASKED ME THAT,

06:40.100 --> 06:41.732
AND I TOLD YOU. NO.

06:41.732 --> 06:44.675
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, LYNETTE?
YOU'D HAVE MADE A GOOD COP.

06:44.675 --> 06:49.009
YOU KNOW HOW TO STAY COOL,
KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.813
LISTEN TO ME.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.945
YOU WOMEN ARE GOOD PEOPLE.
I KNOW THAT.

06:54.945 --> 06:57.988
BUT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
COVERING SOMETHING UP.

06:57.988 --> 07:00.190
NOW FORGET ABOUT
ME BEING A COP, OKAY?

07:00.190 --> 07:01.792
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
AS A FRIEND.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.524
A JURY WILL FORGIVE A LOT
WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND

07:03.524 --> 07:04.695
WHYSOMETHING HAPPENED.

07:04.695 --> 07:08.098
BUT FIRST,
YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING.

07:08.098 --> 07:09.600
I'M NOT LYING.

07:11.161 --> 07:13.504
(pen clatters)
 HOW MUCH MORE OF A TOLL

07:13.504 --> 07:15.165
ARE YOU GONNA LET
THIS THING TAKE ON YOU?

07:15.165 --> 07:16.667
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:16.667 --> 07:19.470
IT MEANS THAT WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'VE DONE,

07:19.470 --> 07:22.012
IT'S CLEARLY THE REASON
YOUR HUSBAND WALKED OUT ON YOU.

07:25.015 --> 07:26.446
SORRY.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.849
BUT YOU SAID TO FORGET
YOU WERE A COP.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.053
HUH. LOOK AT THAT.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.527
WHAT HAPPENED
TO KEEPING YOUR COOL?

07:40.631 --> 07:41.932
RECOGNIZE HIM?

07:41.932 --> 07:44.034
SORRY.

07:44.034 --> 07:47.137
YOU WANNA LOOK AT IT FOR
TWO SECONDS BEFORE YOU ANSWER?

07:47.137 --> 07:48.468
(sighs)

07:48.468 --> 07:50.140
I GOT NOTHING.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.572
CAN I GO?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.504
HE'S A PERSON, GABY.

07:53.504 --> 07:54.575
HE HAS TWO KIDS,

07:54.575 --> 07:55.976
NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOURS.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.579
TWO GIRLS, WHO MAY NEVER SEE
THEIR DADDY AGAIN.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.615
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.757
NOW MAY I LEAVE?
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.661
OH, YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

08:10.661 --> 08:12.492
VISITING YOUR HUSBAND IN REHAB?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.825
I HEARD ABOUT HIS DRINKING.

08:14.825 --> 08:16.627
I'M SORRY.

08:16.627 --> 08:18.999
YEAH. WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

08:18.999 --> 08:21.231
IT LOOKS LIKE WE NIPPED IT
IN THE BUD.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.534
OH, IT'S A NEW PROBLEM?

08:23.534 --> 08:24.575
YEAH. WHY?

08:24.575 --> 08:26.006
USUALLY THERE'S A TRIGGER

08:26.006 --> 08:29.139
WHEN SOMEBODY STARTS ABUSING
ALCOHOL OUT OF THE BLUE.

08:29.139 --> 08:32.111
ANYTHING COME TO MIND?
ANYTHING STRESSFUL?

08:34.544 --> 08:36.616
HE...

08:36.616 --> 08:38.087
HE HAD AN AFFAIR.

08:38.087 --> 08:40.551
CARLOS?

08:40.551 --> 08:41.922
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.695
I KNOW, RIGHT? I MEAN, WHO WOULD
CHEAT ON THIS? (chuckles)

08:44.695 --> 08:47.758
I MEANT BECAUSE HE SEEMS
LIKE SUCH A GOOD MAN.

08:47.758 --> 08:51.632
WELL, HE'S NOT. HE'S A CAD,
A PHILANDERING S.O.B.,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.263
BUT I LOVE HIM. (chuckles)

08:53.263 --> 08:55.535
SO IF I GO THERE TOMORROW

08:55.535 --> 08:59.870
AND ASK CARLOS
THAT SAME QUESTION...

08:59.870 --> 09:02.773
HE'D GIVE ME THE SAME ANSWER?

09:02.773 --> 09:04.214
YOU BET.

09:04.214 --> 09:05.816
GREAT.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.948
I MIGHT JUST DO THAT.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.323
(indistinct conversations)

09:13.323 --> 09:15.325
AH.

09:15.325 --> 09:18.128
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER, PLEASE.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.960
OKAY. (sighs)

09:22.092 --> 09:23.694
YOU GOT A FRIEND
WHO CAN DRIVE YOU HOME?

09:23.694 --> 09:24.564
(sets bottle down)

09:24.564 --> 09:26.336
(chuckles) NO.

09:26.336 --> 09:28.999
TURNS OUT I'M FRIENDLESS
AT THE MOMENT.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.971
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE A TAXI.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.344
(women laughing)

09:34.344 --> 09:36.647
(laughs)

09:38.178 --> 09:39.650
(woman speaks indistinctly)

09:41.682 --> 09:44.755
YOU LADIES SOUND LIKE
YOU'RE HAVING FUN!

09:44.755 --> 09:46.016
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

09:46.016 --> 09:47.888
JUST, YOU KNOW,
GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.790
LEFT THE KIDS AND HUSBANDS
AT HOME.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.091
WHOO-HOO!
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.192
(both) YEAH.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.624
AMEN TO THAT, SISTER.
 (clinks)

09:53.624 --> 09:55.626
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS FAMILIES
WHEN WE'VE GOT GIRLFRIENDS?

09:55.626 --> 09:56.997
AM I RIGHT?

09:58.368 --> 10:00.801
I'M SORRY. WHO ARE YOU?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.873
OH, WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

10:02.873 --> 10:04.334
BREE VAN DE KAMP.

10:04.334 --> 10:07.237
I HEARD YOU ALL CARRYING ON,
AND, WELL,

10:07.237 --> 10:09.609
REALLY, I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE DISCONNECTED LATELY,

10:09.609 --> 10:12.643
AND I THOUGHT, "BREE,
A LITTLE HUMAN CONTACT IS

10:12.643 --> 10:14.144
JUST WHAT YOU NEED."

10:14.144 --> 10:16.917
UH, YEAH,
KELLY JUST HAD A BABY,

10:16.917 --> 10:20.220
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER
FOR A WHILE, SO WE WERE HOPING--

10:20.220 --> 10:24.154
A BABY! OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
WELL, WE NEED TO CELEBRATE.

10:24.154 --> 10:26.226
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE!

10:26.226 --> 10:27.728
IT'S ON ME.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.731
SO HOW DO WE ALL KNOW
EACH OTHER?

10:30.731 --> 10:33.934
WELL, THESE TWO I KNOW
FROM COLLEGE,

10:33.934 --> 10:38.739
AND YOU I KNOW FROM RANDOMLY
SITTING DOWN AT OUR TABLE.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.812
(laughs)

10:41.812 --> 10:43.173
GOD, I MISS THIS.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.118
AND THEN ONE DAY,

10:48.118 --> 10:51.281
YOU WAKE UP AND YOU REALIZE
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.183
NOTHING.

10:53.183 --> 10:54.955
YOUR CHILDREN ABANDON YOU.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.326
EVEN THE GAY ONE.

10:56.326 --> 10:57.858
I MEAN, AREN'T GAY MEN

10:57.858 --> 11:00.360
SUPPOSED TO BE OBSESSED
WITH THEIR MOTHERS?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.163
AS FAR AS RELATIONSHIPS GO,
FORGET IT.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.735
TWO OF THEM LEFT ME.

11:04.735 --> 11:06.096
THREE OF THEM ARE DEAD.

11:06.096 --> 11:09.940
AND ALL OF THIS I COULD BEAR
AS LONG AS I HAD MY GIRLFRIENDS.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.373
BUT NOW
THEY'VE ABANDONED ME, TOO.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.306
EVERYTHING I TOUCH...

11:16.306 --> 11:17.878
(whispers)
EVERYTHING I LOVE...

11:20.711 --> 11:23.113
WELL, ON THAT NOTE,
I THINK I'LL CALL IT A NIGHT.

11:23.113 --> 11:24.354
SAME HERE.

11:24.354 --> 11:25.986
WAIT. IT'S BARELY MIDNIGHT--

11:25.986 --> 11:29.219
AWFULLY EARLY
FOR FOUR SINGLE GALS LIKE US.

11:29.219 --> 11:30.961
WE'RE ALL MARRIED.

11:30.961 --> 11:32.763
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN,
LYNETTE.

11:32.763 --> 11:35.395
STOP CALLING ME LYNETTE.
IT'S REALLY CREEPING ME OUT.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.227
WAIT. I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

11:37.227 --> 11:39.029
(slurring) WHY DON'T YOU ALL
COME BACK TO MY PLACE

11:39.029 --> 11:41.201
AND WE CAN HAVE A SLEEPOVER?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.773
GOOD NIGHT.

11:42.773 --> 11:44.875
NO. NO, PLEASE--
PLEASE COME HOME WITH ME.

11:44.875 --> 11:48.408
I-I HAVE A REALLY BIG HOUSE
WITH LOTS OF EMPTY ROOMS AND--

11:52.783 --> 11:54.885
OKAY, LADY. YOU WANT ME
TO CALL YOU YOUR CAB YET?

11:54.885 --> 11:57.087
NO.

11:57.087 --> 11:59.419
I'M JUST GONNA FINISH
LYNETTE'S CHAMPAGNE.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.834
BEN.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.135
HELLO.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.937
HOW YOU FEELING?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.339
FINE. WHY DO YOU ASK?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.311
YOU DON'T REMEMBER LAST NIGHT,
DO YOU?

12:21.311 --> 12:23.774
OF COURSE I DO.

12:23.774 --> 12:25.315
REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?

12:25.315 --> 12:28.819
I WENT OUT TO DINNER
WITH A FEW GIRLFRIENDS,

12:28.819 --> 12:30.350
CAME HOME, AND WENT TO BED.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.422
UH, CLOSE.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.825
YOU KNOCKED ON MY DOOR
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING

12:34.825 --> 12:36.226
TO BORROW MONEY,

12:36.226 --> 12:38.058
'CAUSE THE CAB DRIVER
WOULDN'T TAKE

12:38.058 --> 12:40.260
THE FRIED ZUCCHINI
YOU HAD IN YOUR PURSE.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.833
THEN YOU CURSED AT ME
FOR NOT MAKING YOU PANCAKES

12:42.833 --> 12:45.936
BEFORE YOU STUMBLED BACK
TO YOUR HOUSE.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.944
(sighs)

12:53.944 --> 12:55.475
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
OFF THE WAGON?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.177
A FEW DAYS.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.210
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.312
IT'S JUST A TEMPORARY RELAPSE.

13:02.312 --> 13:04.014
I'LL GET IT UNDER CONTROL.

13:04.014 --> 13:06.056
LOOK...

13:06.056 --> 13:10.090
ISOLATING YOURSELF IS
ONLY GONNA MAKE MATTERS WORSE.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.522
YOU GOT A GREAT GROUP
OF FRIENDS.

13:12.522 --> 13:14.194
REACH OUT TO THEM.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.395
I CAN'T.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.527
WE'RE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS
RIGHT NOW.

13:17.527 --> 13:19.429
WELL,
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIX THAT.

13:19.429 --> 13:21.431
I TRIED.

13:21.431 --> 13:24.034
BUT THEY ALL SEEM TO HATE ME.

13:24.034 --> 13:27.107
WELL, MY RECOMMENDATION?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.309
START WITH THE ONE
WHO HATES YOU THE LEAST.

13:35.946 --> 13:38.218
OH. NOT READY FOR THAT.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.920
(chuckles)

13:39.920 --> 13:41.421
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.554
I'D HATE FOR YOU TO WASTE
ANOTHER ONE WITH A HANGOVER.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.997
THANK YOU, BEN.

13:48.358 --> 13:50.230
AH.

13:53.163 --> 13:54.334
SEE YA.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.342
(revs engine)

14:02.342 --> 14:03.413
OHH.

14:03.413 --> 14:05.615
I KNOW CHUCK COULD TELL
I WAS LYING.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.378
I ALWAYS DO THAT THING
WHEN I LIE.

14:08.378 --> 14:10.250
WH-WHAT THING?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.381
OH, LIKE I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

14:11.381 --> 14:13.323
(sighs)

14:13.323 --> 14:15.855
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TERRIFYING IT WAS.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.858
LOOK, HAVE A DRINK.
IT'LL CALM YOU DOWN.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.930
I DON'T WANT A DRINK.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.261
REALLY?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.492
OF COURSE I WANT A DRINK.

14:22.492 --> 14:24.434
SEE? I'M A TERRIBLE LIAR.

14:24.434 --> 14:28.638
LOOK, IF CHUCK HAD
SOMETHING CONCRETE, WE'D KNOW.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.470
I'M SURE HE'S JUST FISHING.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.003
HE IS NOT GONNA LET UP.

14:33.003 --> 14:35.405
HE IS JUST WAITING
TILL I CRACK.

14:35.405 --> 14:38.508
HONEY, YOU'RE PANICKING
OVER NOTHING. THE BODY'S GONE.

14:38.508 --> 14:40.650
CHUCK DOESN'T HAVE A CASE
WITHOUT IT.

14:40.650 --> 14:43.883
NO, THE ONLY WAY THIS THING
BLOWS UP IS IF SOMEBODY TALKS.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.056
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING TO ME?

14:46.056 --> 14:47.417
ITALK. ME.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.560
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S GONNA SEND US AWAY.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.062
(glass rattles)

14:52.062 --> 14:53.523
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN,

14:53.523 --> 14:55.065
JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS,

14:55.065 --> 14:58.328
UNTIL CHUCK FINDS SOMEONE ELSE
TO FOCUS ON.

14:58.328 --> 15:01.271
NOT ONLY WOULD THAT LOOK
INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS,

15:01.271 --> 15:04.004
WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF MONEY
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.405
OKAY. MONEY.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.077
WE NEED MONEY.

15:07.077 --> 15:08.908
WE CAN HAVE A GARAGE SALE.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.580
GRAB SOME CHAIRS.
I'LL PUT UP SOME FLYERS.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.382
TRUST ME.

15:12.382 --> 15:14.114
WE'RE GONNA STAY HERE,

15:14.114 --> 15:17.517
AND EVERYTHING IS
GONNA BE FINE.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.489
WOW.

15:19.489 --> 15:21.521
YOU'RE AN EVEN WORSE LIAR
THAN I AM.

15:28.198 --> 15:29.659
OH. HELLO.

15:29.659 --> 15:31.962
EXCUSE ME. HELLO?

15:31.962 --> 15:34.164
SOMEONE IS NEVER GONNA FINISH
"THE HELP."

15:34.164 --> 15:35.565
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

15:35.565 --> 15:37.707
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY HUSBAND,
CARLOS SOLIS.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.509
IS IT AN EMERGENCY?

15:39.509 --> 15:42.342
NO. I JUST NEED
TO TELL HIM SOMETHING.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.943
THEN I CAN'T ALLOW YOU.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.546
MR. SOLIS IS STILL
ON RESTRICTED ACCESS.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.677
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:47.677 --> 15:49.479
UH, FIRST WEEK AFTER ADMISSION,
NO VISITORS,

15:49.479 --> 15:51.351
CELL PHONES, OR E-MAILS.
NO DISTRACTIONS.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.653
WE ONLY WANT OUR PATIENTS
TO FOCUS ON GETTING BETTER.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.725
OKAY, BUT I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.287
I'M SORRY.

15:57.287 --> 15:58.989
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

16:00.430 --> 16:04.594
WELL, RULES ARE MADE
TO BE BROKEN.

16:04.594 --> 16:08.738
I'M SURE THERE'S A "NO BOOBS
ON THE COUNTER" RULE, TOO.

16:08.738 --> 16:10.470
SERIOUSLY?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.743
MALE NURSE.

16:15.245 --> 16:16.506
RIGHT.

16:16.506 --> 16:17.507
(sighs)

16:17.507 --> 16:19.109
YOU CAN COME BACK
ON TUESDAY.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.751
(man speaks indistinctly)

16:21.751 --> 16:25.185
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!
I SHOULD'VE SEEN THE SIGNS.
 IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
IT WAS MINE. I WAS NEVER AROUND.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.986
KID DIDN'T HAVE A ROLE MODEL.
 WE'RE GETTING YOU HELP,
JIMMY.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.588
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOU HERE.
 I DON'T NEED THIS PLACE.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.491
I TOLD YOU.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
 (woman) MANZANI. WE CALLED.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.662
ADMISSIONS IS
RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR.

16:32.662 --> 16:35.295
THANK YOU. COME ON.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.168
(woman sobs)

16:38.168 --> 16:40.430
WE SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS
COMING.

16:42.132 --> 16:45.735
JIMMY, WE'RE ONLY DOING THIS
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

16:45.735 --> 16:49.739
SUCH A TRAGEDY.
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

16:49.739 --> 16:51.041
ALL RIGHT, GOTTA GO.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.514
EXCUSE ME.

16:55.745 --> 16:57.217
WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

16:57.217 --> 17:00.250
OH, UH, I'M WITH THEM--
THE MANZINIS.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.551
IF YOU'RE WITH THE FAMILY,

17:01.551 --> 17:02.752
YOU NEED TO STAY
FOR GROUP COUNSELING.

17:02.752 --> 17:05.355
OH, I DON'T THINK I HAVE
MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE.

17:05.355 --> 17:06.496
IT'S VITAL.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.198
THIS WAY.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.531
(button clicks)

17:11.531 --> 17:13.563
COME ON, TOM.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.565
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.637
(clicks)

17:17.637 --> 17:19.638
FINE. I'LL GET IN ANOTHER WAY

17:19.638 --> 17:21.570
AND POUND ON YOUR DOOR
UNTIL YOU OPEN UP.
 (clicks)

17:21.570 --> 17:23.213
(woman) Yes?

17:23.213 --> 17:24.614
(imitates Spanish accent)
 HOLA.

17:24.614 --> 17:26.076
MY NAME IS MARIA.

17:26.076 --> 17:29.279
I FORGOT THE KEYS
TO MR. TOM'SCASA.

17:29.279 --> 17:31.050
COULD YOU LET ME IN,
 POR FAVOR?

17:31.050 --> 17:34.354
There's no Mr. Tom here.
You have the wrong apartment.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.525
NO.

17:35.525 --> 17:39.559
I AM DOING THE CLEANING
FOR MR. TOM.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.163
WOW. IMPERSONATING
A MAID STEREOTYPE.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.494
PATHETIC MUCH?

17:44.494 --> 17:46.166
(normal voice) OH, CHLOE, LOOK,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.468
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER AND MY
HUSBAND ARE LEAVING FOR PARIS.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.300
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO TOM
FOR FIVE MINUTES

17:50.300 --> 17:51.771
BEFORE THEY HEAD
TO THE AIRPORT.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.403
THEY LEFT AN HOUR AGO.

17:53.403 --> 17:54.604
Who's there?

17:54.604 --> 17:56.646
I GOT IT, MS. SCHOENFIELD.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.348
This is Ms. Schoenfield.

17:58.348 --> 17:59.649
DO YOU KNOW WHAT FLIGHT
THEY'RE TAKING?

17:59.649 --> 18:01.281
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
I TALK WITH TOM.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.652
HE'S NOT PICKING UP
HIS PHONE.

18:02.652 --> 18:04.314
JEEZ, STALK MUCH?

18:04.314 --> 18:07.317
COME ON. COME ON.
I'M NOT A STALKER.

18:07.317 --> 18:10.390
SERIOUSLY? MY MOM TOLD ME
YOU WERE HIDING UNDER HIS BED

18:10.390 --> 18:11.721
WHILETHEY WERE IN IT.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.593
SO I'M CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO HELP YOU

18:13.593 --> 18:15.395
SABOTAGE HER TRIP TO PARIS.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.527
LISTEN TO ME.
SOMETHING HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

18:17.527 --> 18:20.800
AND I CAN'T GO INTO IT,
BUT TOM NEEDS TO BE HERE--

18:20.800 --> 18:22.732
NOT FOR ME, FOR THE KIDS.

18:22.732 --> 18:25.475
PLEASE. PLEASE.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.638
FINE.

18:28.638 --> 18:30.710
I'VE GOT THEIR FLIGHT
INFORMATION UPSTAIRS.
 (beep)

18:30.710 --> 18:32.682
THANK YOU.

18:32.682 --> 18:34.614
(crying)
 IT'S CLEAR
JIMMY FEELS CONFLICTED

18:34.614 --> 18:36.886
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
HE BELONGS IN REHAB,

18:36.886 --> 18:38.348
BUT HIS LOVED ONES--

18:38.348 --> 18:39.749
ALL OF YOU IN THIS ROOM--

18:39.749 --> 18:42.522
ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU CARE DEEPLY
ABOUT HELPING HIM.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.394
SO LET'S START
BY SHARING WITH JIMMY

18:44.394 --> 18:48.298
THE WAYS HIS DRINKING
HAS IMPACTED YOUR LIVES.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.129
MRS. MANZANI, GO AHEAD.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.262
WELL, ACTUALLY,
CAN I GO FIRST?

18:52.262 --> 18:53.833
I HAVE SOMEWHERE
I NEED TO BE.

18:56.906 --> 18:59.369
WHO ARE YOU?

18:59.369 --> 19:00.910
I THOUGHT YOU WORKED HERE.

19:00.910 --> 19:02.912
NO. NO. NO. I AM...

19:02.912 --> 19:04.574
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

19:04.574 --> 19:07.447
EX-GIRLFRIEND, YOU KNOW,
SINCE ALL THE PROBLEMS STARTED.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.579
GIRLFRIEND?

19:09.579 --> 19:11.681
ANOTHER THING
YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT.

19:11.681 --> 19:12.922
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:12.922 --> 19:14.754
I NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

19:17.827 --> 19:19.289
(scoffs)

19:19.289 --> 19:21.291
YEAH. THAT'S THE PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.662
YOU KNOW,
HOW CAN YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

19:22.662 --> 19:25.565
WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND DRINKS
AND DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER YOU?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.237
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
A WEDDING RING?

19:28.338 --> 19:29.869
OH...

19:29.869 --> 19:31.571
'CAUSE I MOVED ON.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.172
THAT'S RIGHT, JIMMY.
YOU HAD TO HEAR IT.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.805
I SERIOUSLY HAD YOU
FOR A GIRLFRIEND?

19:35.805 --> 19:37.677
YOU ARE SMOKING HOT.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.609
YEAH, I AM.

19:39.609 --> 19:41.911
OH, MY GOD.
I DO HAVE A PROBLEM.

19:41.911 --> 19:44.814
I WAS WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IT.

19:44.814 --> 19:47.317
MOM, POP,

19:47.317 --> 19:48.488
I WANT TO GET BETTER.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.489
OH!

19:49.489 --> 19:50.490
OH, JIMMY!

19:50.490 --> 19:52.422
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, JIMMY!

19:52.422 --> 19:54.694
NOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN HERE JUST LIKE YOU

19:54.694 --> 19:56.526
WHO CAN HELP YOU,

19:56.526 --> 19:58.828
LIKE, UH, LIKE JASON HURWITZ

19:58.828 --> 20:01.931
AND PETER MORTON
AND CARLOS SOLIS, ROOM 247.

20:01.931 --> 20:03.673
OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.813
(whispers) HEY!

20:13.813 --> 20:14.914
(turns off vacuum cleaner)

20:14.914 --> 20:17.247
GABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:17.247 --> 20:18.548
ARE THE KIDS OKAY?

20:18.548 --> 20:20.850
YEAH, THE KIDS ARE FINE.
I JUST NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.752
WHAT'S THIS? YOU DON'T
LIFT A FINGER AT HOME,

20:22.752 --> 20:24.394
BUT HERE YOU VACUUM?

20:24.394 --> 20:25.825
THIS IS MY GROUP TASK.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.258
RECOVERY HERE IS BASED
ON TWO CORE PRINCIPLES--

20:28.258 --> 20:30.900
RESPONSIBILITY
AND TOTAL HONESTY.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.302
OKAY. GREAT.

20:32.302 --> 20:35.505
COME IN HERE. I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A LIE.

20:35.505 --> 20:38.438
SO WHEN CHUCK ASKS
WHAT MADE YOU START DRINKING--

20:38.438 --> 20:39.839
AND I'M GUESSING HE WILL--

20:39.839 --> 20:41.611
SAY YOU CHEATED ON ME.

20:41.611 --> 20:42.812
WITH WHO?

20:42.812 --> 20:44.374
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:44.374 --> 20:45.915
SOMEONE UGLY.
DON'T GO OVERBOARD.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.377
SO... (sighs)

20:47.377 --> 20:49.749
CHUCK SAW SUSAN'S PAINTINGS,
HE'S QUESTIONED EACH OF YOU,

20:49.749 --> 20:52.922
AND YOU THINK THIS ONE LIE
IS GOING TO THROW HIM OFF?

20:52.922 --> 20:53.923
HE'S GOT NOTHING ELSE.

20:53.923 --> 20:55.925
GABY, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT COPS.

20:55.925 --> 20:59.789
WHAT YOU THINK HE KNOWS IS ABOUT
ONE-TENTH OF WHAT HE DOES KNOW.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.463
WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THIS GUY.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.396
GOD, THIS IS A HELL OF A TIME
FOR ME TO BE STUCK IN HERE.

21:06.396 --> 21:08.898
NO, HONEY. HEY, HEY,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

21:08.898 --> 21:10.600
YOU JUST FOCUS
ON GETTING BETTER.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.743
I'LL TRY.

21:13.743 --> 21:16.806
OKAY, WELL, I SHOULD GET OUT
OF HERE BEFORE THEY FIND ME.

21:16.806 --> 21:18.908
TELL THE GIRLS I MISS 'EM?

21:18.908 --> 21:20.680
THEY MISS YOU, TOO.

21:27.717 --> 21:28.958
MR. BERGMAN, HI.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.560
UH, REMEMBER ME?

21:30.560 --> 21:34.424
REMEMBER YOU? SUSAN DELFINO,
YOU SOLD FIVE PAINTINGS

21:34.424 --> 21:36.796
20 MINUTES
INTO YOUR FIRST ART SHOW.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.928
YOU ARE MY PRODIGY.

21:38.928 --> 21:41.801
ARE YOU HERE TO REVEL
IN YOUR GLORY?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.974
ACTUALLY, NO, UH, SEE, I'M...

21:44.974 --> 21:47.377
UH, KIND OF
IN A ROUGH SPOT RIGHT NOW.

21:47.377 --> 21:48.538
OH, DEAR.

21:48.538 --> 21:50.940
YOU SEEM A BIT AGITATED.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.983
YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING
JUMPING OFF A BRIDGE, ARE YOU?

21:53.983 --> 21:55.345
BUT IF YOU ARE,

21:55.345 --> 21:56.946
COULD YOU PLEASE
LEAVE BEHIND

21:56.946 --> 21:59.849
A LARGE BODY OF WORK
FOR ME TO SELL?

21:59.849 --> 22:03.993
NO. UH, IT'S JUST, UM...

22:03.993 --> 22:07.957
I NEED THE MONEY
FROM MY PAINTINGS, PLEASE.

22:07.957 --> 22:10.730
OH. I JUST STARTED
ON THE PAPERWORK.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.903
YOU SHOULD RECEIVE A CHECK
IN UH, FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

22:13.903 --> 22:17.407
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I-I NEED IT NOW.

22:17.407 --> 22:19.839
I, UM...

22:19.839 --> 22:21.871
HAVE TO GET OUT OF TOWN
FOR A WHILE.

22:21.871 --> 22:23.473
OHH.

22:23.473 --> 22:26.516
MY HOUSEWIFE JUST GOT
EVEN MORE INTERESTING.

22:26.516 --> 22:28.017
ARE YOU A JUNKIE?

22:28.017 --> 22:28.948
GAMBLER?

22:28.948 --> 22:31.481
ARE YOU ON THE RUN
FROM THE MOB?

22:31.481 --> 22:34.484
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.

22:34.484 --> 22:35.655
I JUST REALLY NEED
THAT MONEY.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.986
WELL, HERE'S THE THING--

22:36.986 --> 22:41.891
UM, I AM HAVING A TEENSY BIT OF
A CASH-FLOW PROBLEM. (chuckles)

22:41.891 --> 22:43.863
BUT I ASSURE YOU,

22:43.863 --> 22:45.034
EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS--

22:45.034 --> 22:46.736
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
FOUR TO SIX.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.738
OKAY, NOT SO TEENSY.

22:48.738 --> 22:51.901
MR. BERGMAN, I WOULDN'T ASK
IF IT WASN'TREALLYIMPORTANT.

22:51.901 --> 22:54.404
NO, I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO,

22:54.404 --> 22:56.876
BUT NO PROMISES...

22:56.876 --> 23:00.149
MY MYSTERIOUS LITTLE HOUSEWIFE.

23:03.913 --> 23:04.914
(chuckles)

23:04.914 --> 23:06.115
MM. (laughs)

23:06.115 --> 23:08.558
THAT'S NICE.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
 (hose shuts off)

23:08.558 --> 23:11.661
OH, YOU WERE RIGHT.
A HUG SHOULD BE FOR SOMETHING,

23:11.661 --> 23:14.063
LIKE THE ONE I SAW YOU
GIVING BREE THIS MORNING.

23:14.063 --> 23:15.525
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

23:15.525 --> 23:16.626
OH, RENEE.

23:16.626 --> 23:18.067
THAT WAS NOTHING.

23:18.067 --> 23:20.800
OH, SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
DOOR-TO-DOOR GIVING HUGS?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.032
WHAT, IS THAT
AN AUSTRALIAN THING?

23:23.032 --> 23:26.606
LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING
BETWEEN ME AND BREE.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.178
SHE'S JUST GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

23:29.178 --> 23:31.481
I WAS A SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

23:31.481 --> 23:32.982
(car door opens)

23:32.982 --> 23:36.686
OH, AS LONG AS THAT SHOULDER
ISN'T A GATEWAY BODY PART.

23:36.686 --> 23:38.147
(car door closes)

23:38.147 --> 23:39.719
(footsteps approach)

23:39.719 --> 23:42.452
OH, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I ONLY NEED A MINUTE.

23:42.452 --> 23:44.053
I JUST HAVE TO ASK YOU

23:44.053 --> 23:46.155
A COUPLE QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

23:46.155 --> 23:47.827
SO ASK ME.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.198
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

23:49.198 --> 23:51.000
NOT YOU. BREE.

23:52.802 --> 23:54.133
FUNNY.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.537
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND BREE.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.908
GOOD-BYE.

23:58.908 --> 24:00.109
RENEE...

24:02.472 --> 24:04.474
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR?

24:04.474 --> 24:05.845
I DON'T KNOW.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.777
JUST TRYING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE
MISERABLE.

24:07.777 --> 24:08.948
OH, AND I GOT MORE.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.780
I'M TRACKING DOWN
A MISSING PERSON.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.922
IT TURNS OUT
HIS LAST PHONE SIGNAL

24:12.922 --> 24:15.655
CAME FROM SOMEWHERE
ON YOUR CONSTRUCTION SITE.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.657
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.059
DOESN'T MATTER. STILL A GREAT
REASON TO SHUT YOU DOWN.

24:21.130 --> 24:22.632
HOW LONG?

24:22.632 --> 24:24.634
TWO WEEKS. MAYBE A MONTH.
I DON'T KNOW.

24:24.634 --> 24:26.235
OH, LET ME GUESS--

24:26.235 --> 24:29.639
AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR ME
TO LOSE MY INVESTMENT, YEAH?

24:29.639 --> 24:33.042
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.975
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ON THAT
PROPERTY WITHOUT A WARRANT.

24:38.107 --> 24:39.979
OH, JEEZ.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.612
WHERE WOULD A DETECTIVE GET
ONE OF THOSE?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.156
SEE YOU MONDAY.

24:55.825 --> 24:58.768
OH, MY GOD.
THIS TASTES SO GOOD.

24:58.768 --> 25:00.900
I KNOW. IT REMINDS ME
OF THE FIRST TIME

25:00.900 --> 25:03.172
LYNETTE AND I EVER FLEW
FIRST CLASS.

25:03.172 --> 25:04.874
WE HAD BEEN SO USED TO
TRAVELING COACH--

25:04.874 --> 25:05.905
TOM?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.206
YEAH?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.980
PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

25:10.980 --> 25:13.843
YOU'RE ON A ROMANTIC TRIP
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

25:13.843 --> 25:16.916
DO YOU THINK IT COULD
JUST STAY THE TWO OF US?

25:16.916 --> 25:19.118
I'M SORRY.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.791
(chuckles) OLD HABITS.

25:21.791 --> 25:25.625
THAT IS THE LAST TIME
YOU'LL HEAR OF LYNETTE.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.159
TO PARIS...

25:30.159 --> 25:31.631
(clink)
 MA CHERI.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.803
MMM.
 (chuckles)

25:33.803 --> 25:35.164
OH.

25:35.164 --> 25:37.967
GOOD.
STAY CLOSE WITH THAT MOP.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.569
(woman over P.A.)
FLIGHT 502 TO PARIS

25:39.569 --> 25:41.170
WILL BE BOARDING
IN FIVE MINUTES.

25:41.170 --> 25:43.312
I'M GONNA RUN TO THE MEN'S ROOM.
IT'S A LONG FLIGHT,

25:43.312 --> 25:46.145
AND AIRPLANE BATHROOMS
FREAK ME OUT.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.077
WELL, THERE GOES ONE FANTASY.

25:48.077 --> 25:49.879
OH. (chuckles)

25:58.057 --> 25:59.859
HEY, LYNETTE.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.891
(turns off faucet)
 WHAT THE HELL
AREYOUDOING HERE?

26:01.891 --> 26:03.062
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.293
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

26:04.293 --> 26:06.195
YOU THINK I WANT TO CHASE YOU
DOWN IN AN AIRPORT MEN'S ROOM?

26:06.195 --> 26:07.266
NOW LISTEN TO ME.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.669
I CAN ONLY BREATHE THROUGH
MY MOUTH FOR A FEW MINUTES.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.141
WELL,
YOU CAN SAVE YOUR BREATH,

26:12.141 --> 26:14.203
'CAUSE I AM GOING--

26:15.875 --> 26:18.107
I AM GOING TO PARIS WITH JANE,

26:18.107 --> 26:20.650
AND I'M SORRY IF YOU'RE HAVING
A HARD TIME WITH IT.

26:20.650 --> 26:23.352
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND JANE.
LOOK. SEE? GOOD WITH IT. OKAY?

26:23.352 --> 26:26.215
OKAY, GOOD.
THEN--THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

26:26.215 --> 26:30.860
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO
TO PARIS, NOT NOW.

26:30.860 --> 26:32.161
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED.

26:32.161 --> 26:34.163
YOU DON'T CARE IF
I GO TO PARIS WITH JANE,

26:34.163 --> 26:35.865
BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME
I CAN'T GO TO PARIS WITH JANE.

26:35.865 --> 26:37.196
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

26:37.196 --> 26:38.868
BUT IT'S JUST REALLY HARD
TO SAY--

26:38.868 --> 26:40.900
I'M SORRY, BUT MY PLANE
IS BOARDING. I HAVE TO GO.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.002
I'M AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER.

26:55.284 --> 26:57.086
HERE.
LET ME HELP YOU WITH THIS.

26:57.086 --> 27:00.049
I THINK YOU'VE HELPED ENOUGH.

27:00.049 --> 27:02.121
GABY, PLEASE.
I CAN'T STAND THIS ANYMORE.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.793
CAN'T WE TALK FOR A MINUTE?

27:03.793 --> 27:05.024
(sighs) TO BE HONEST,

27:05.024 --> 27:07.226
AFTER WHAT CHUCK PUT ME THROUGH,
I'M KIND OF TALKED OUT.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.198
WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:09.198 --> 27:11.861
HE INTERROGATED US--
ME, LYNETTE, AND SUSAN.

27:11.861 --> 27:14.664
HE CALLED US DOWN TO THE STATION
AND GRILLED US ONE BY ONE.

27:14.664 --> 27:16.205
WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME
DOWN THERE?

27:16.205 --> 27:18.337
GOOD QUESTION, GIVEN
THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT YOU.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.209
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:20.209 --> 27:22.772
BREE, HE WANTS REVENGE.
HE WANTS TO BRINGYOUDOWN,

27:22.772 --> 27:24.343
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA GO DOWN
WITH YOU.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.115
GABY, PLEASE.

27:26.115 --> 27:28.918
I WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

27:28.918 --> 27:30.079
NO, YOU WON'T.

27:30.079 --> 27:33.382
THIS ISN'T GONNA STOP
UNTIL CHUCK IS STOPPED.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.985
(sighs)

27:41.330 --> 27:43.032
SAY SOMETHING.

27:43.032 --> 27:44.934
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

27:44.934 --> 27:48.097
I WANTED TO, A HUNDRED TIMES,
BUT WE WEREN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE,

27:48.097 --> 27:50.770
AND IT SEEMED WRONG
TO DRAG YOU INTO IT.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.772
TOM?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.073
PLANE'S BOARDING.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.078
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.351
JANE, I'M SORRY. I KNOW
WHAT THIS MUST LOOK LIKE.

28:02.351 --> 28:04.113
REALLY?

28:04.113 --> 28:07.156
YOU KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
TO WALK INTO A MEN'S ROOM

28:07.156 --> 28:09.188
AND FIND YOUR BOYFRIEND'S EX
CHATTING HIM UP

28:09.188 --> 28:11.060
BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT TO PARIS?

28:11.060 --> 28:12.461
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

28:12.461 --> 28:15.194
OH. OF COURSE NOT.
I'M THE CRAZY ONE.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.767
YOU TWO RENDEZVOUSING
IN AN AIRPORT TOILET?

28:17.767 --> 28:20.229
I'M THE NUT JOB.
SHE'S HIDING UNDER YOUR BED?

28:20.229 --> 28:22.171
JANE'S THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO BE SEDATED.

28:22.171 --> 28:25.905
TOM, I REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH
THIS RIGHT NOW. CAN WE JUST GO?

28:34.243 --> 28:39.088
YOU ARENOTDOING THIS TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

28:40.149 --> 28:44.123
WE WILL GO
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.324
I PROMISE.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.933
(door opens)

28:53.933 --> 28:55.304
JANE.

28:55.304 --> 28:57.466
JANE, IT'S REALLY NOT
TOM'S FAULT.

29:02.111 --> 29:03.873
TOM...

29:03.873 --> 29:05.144
HONEY...

29:05.144 --> 29:07.316
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING,
RIGHT?

29:07.316 --> 29:09.919
YOU GIVE IN HERE, NOW,

29:09.919 --> 29:11.851
IT'LL NEVER STOP.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.983
I AM SO SORRY.

29:13.983 --> 29:16.025
IT--BUT...

29:16.025 --> 29:18.427
THERE ARE
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

29:18.427 --> 29:19.789
OKAY.

29:19.789 --> 29:21.230
THEN TELL ME.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.292
TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE.

29:23.292 --> 29:25.795
I THINK I AT LEAST
DESERVE THAT.

29:33.843 --> 29:35.945
UH...

29:35.945 --> 29:37.877
OKAY.

29:42.411 --> 29:45.184
I'M GOING TO PARIS,

29:45.184 --> 29:48.818
AND IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN MEET ME THERE.

29:56.065 --> 29:57.426
I'M SO SORRY.

29:57.426 --> 30:00.169
LYNETTE, DON'T.

30:00.169 --> 30:01.430
JUST...

30:01.430 --> 30:03.402
DON'T TALK.

30:10.539 --> 30:14.313
(doorbell rings)

30:14.313 --> 30:16.886
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
YOU BROUGHT IT.

30:16.886 --> 30:19.919
NOW BEFORE I GIVE IT TO YOU--
OH, WELL, THAT NEVER WORKS.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.250
(squeals)

30:21.250 --> 30:22.521
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY...

30:22.521 --> 30:25.895
I HAVE A LITTLE PROPOSITION
FOR YOU.

30:25.895 --> 30:28.327
OH, CALM DOWN. IT'S NOT SEX.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.329
DANG IT.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.202
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING

30:33.202 --> 30:36.035
THAT MAKES A GREAT ARTIST.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.436
MAYBE IT'S TALENT.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.408
MAYBE IT'S MENTAL ILLNESS.

30:39.408 --> 30:41.971
ALL I HEARD WAS "GREAT ARTIST."
KEEP GOING.

30:41.971 --> 30:44.413
FAIRVIEW IS NOT
THE FERTILE GROUND

30:44.413 --> 30:47.516
REQUIRED FOR YOU TO GROW.

30:47.516 --> 30:49.979
I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE
YOUR SKINNY LITTLE TUSH

30:49.979 --> 30:51.380
TO NEW YORK CITY.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.883
MOVE? UH, NO.

30:53.883 --> 30:56.055
I JUST NEED TO GET AWAY
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.856
I'LL SET YOU UP
IN AN APARTMENT.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.988
YOU PAINT.

30:58.988 --> 31:01.390
I'LL TAKE 50%
OF WHATEVER I SELL,

31:01.390 --> 31:05.234
BUT LET'S NOT GET BOGGED DOWN IN
HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE.

31:05.234 --> 31:06.565
WHAT ABOUT MY FAMILY?

31:06.565 --> 31:09.368
MY SON IS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIRD GRADE.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.041
NEW YORK HAS THE BEST
PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE WORLD.

31:12.041 --> 31:15.404
HE CAN WEAR A LITTLE BLAZER
TO SCHOOL.

31:15.404 --> 31:17.907
HECK, IF HE CAN FIT
INTO A CHILD'S MEDIUM,

31:17.907 --> 31:19.608
I CAN LOAN HIM ONE OF MINE.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.182
OH.

31:23.182 --> 31:26.115
(clicks tongue) I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING BEFORE.

31:26.115 --> 31:28.587
WELL,
WHAT IS KEEPING YOU HERE?

31:34.123 --> 31:36.065
YEAH, NOT MUCH.

31:36.065 --> 31:37.166
OKAY.

31:37.166 --> 31:38.627
THINK IT OVER.

31:38.627 --> 31:42.171
BUT IF YOU TURN ME DOWN,
THEN I'LL KNOW...

31:42.171 --> 31:44.333
(whispers)
IT'S MENTAL ILLNESS.

31:47.236 --> 31:50.309
(door opens and closes)

31:50.309 --> 31:51.680
(indistinct conversations)

31:51.680 --> 31:54.483
(footsteps approach)

31:54.483 --> 31:57.086
I WANT TO OFFER YOU A DEAL.

31:57.086 --> 31:58.517
A DEAL?

31:58.517 --> 32:00.149
REALLY?

32:00.149 --> 32:01.991
TERMS?

32:01.991 --> 32:03.192
WHATEVER I'VE DONE--

32:03.192 --> 32:05.924
OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU THINK I'VE DONE--

32:05.924 --> 32:09.198
YOU... WRITE IT UP,
AND I'LL SIGN A CONFESSION.

32:10.499 --> 32:12.431
IN EXCHANGE FOR...

32:12.431 --> 32:14.163
YOU LEAVE MY FRIENDS
OUT OF IT.

32:14.163 --> 32:15.364
OH, DARN.

32:15.364 --> 32:17.967
I WAS ACTUALLY INTERESTED THERE
FOR A MINUTE.

32:17.967 --> 32:19.668
WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN
BY HARASSING MY FRIENDS?

32:19.668 --> 32:21.070
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:21.070 --> 32:23.212
THIS.

32:23.212 --> 32:25.014
YOU IN PAIN.

32:25.014 --> 32:27.176
YOU SEE,

32:27.176 --> 32:30.479
I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO HURT YOU THE WAY YOU HURT ME.

32:30.479 --> 32:33.952
IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH I'M HURTING ALREADY--

32:33.952 --> 32:36.125
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU KNOW WHY?

32:36.125 --> 32:37.326
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO RESILIENT.

32:37.326 --> 32:39.658
HUSBANDS DIE, KIDS LEAVE,
BUSINESSES COLLAPSE,

32:39.658 --> 32:42.231
AND BREE ALWAYS BOUNCES BACK.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.333
BUT THREATEN HER FRIENDS?

32:44.333 --> 32:45.434
OUCH.

32:45.434 --> 32:47.636
PLEASE.

32:47.636 --> 32:50.169
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE I LOVE.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.201
THEY'RE MY WHOLE WORLD.

32:52.201 --> 32:54.243
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE.

32:54.243 --> 32:56.705
YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.449
THAT'S A BAD POSITION
TO MAKE A DEAL FROM.

33:04.613 --> 33:06.055
SORRY.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.460
HEY, YOU REMEMBER THAT DEAL
I WANTED TO MAKE WITH YOU?

33:13.392 --> 33:16.195
YOU MARRY ME AND I TAKE CARE
OF YOU THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

33:18.467 --> 33:21.230
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN IT.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.151
HEY. YOU'RE OLD
AND PRETTY MUCH HOUSEBOUND.

33:42.151 --> 33:47.396
HAVE YOU NOTICED IF BEN'S BEEN
"ENTERTAINING" A LOT LATELY?

33:47.396 --> 33:49.598
THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR NOT HAVING A PIT BULL.

33:49.598 --> 33:50.659
(sighs)

33:50.659 --> 33:52.331
I THINK HE'S CHEATING ON ME.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.534
BEN? NO, HE--HE SEEMS
LIKE A GREAT GUY.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.268
MY EX WAS A GREAT GUY, TOO. ASK
ANY STRIPPER IN NEW YORK CITY.

33:59.268 --> 34:02.111
OH, MY GOD!
I CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

34:02.111 --> 34:03.672
I-I JUST CAN'T.

34:03.672 --> 34:06.115
RENEE, I MAY NOT BE
YOUR BIGGEST FAN

34:06.115 --> 34:08.417
OR... EVEN LIKE YOU,

34:08.417 --> 34:11.049
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
NO ONE CAN ARGUE WITH--

34:11.049 --> 34:13.051
YOU ARE HOT.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.224
PARDON?

34:15.224 --> 34:16.554
LOOK AT YOU.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.157
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT--

34:18.157 --> 34:21.489
THOSE GAMS, THOSE CURVES,
THAT KILLER SMILE.

34:21.489 --> 34:24.433
BASICALLY YOU'RE ME
35 YEARS AGO.

34:24.433 --> 34:27.295
SO THIS IS MY FUTURE?

34:27.295 --> 34:29.498
THE POINT IS,

34:29.498 --> 34:32.101
WHOEVER THIS WOMAN IS,
SHE CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO YOU.

34:32.101 --> 34:35.143
OH, THANK YOU, KAREN.

34:35.143 --> 34:36.804
NOW GO OUT THERE
AND FIGHT FOR YOUR MAN.

34:36.804 --> 34:41.079
YOU'RE RIGHT. TONIGHT I WILL
THROW ON A LITTLE NOTHING

34:41.079 --> 34:42.451
AND MAKE A HOUSE CALL.

34:42.451 --> 34:43.812
THATTAGIRL.

34:47.516 --> 34:49.087
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.420
I WISH I HAD KNOWN YOU
35 YEARS AGO.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.262
WE WOULD'VE MADE
A HELL OF A TEAM.

34:53.262 --> 34:55.824
HEY, WE STILL CAN
IF THE AUSSIE'S INTO IT.

34:59.868 --> 35:02.371
STOP PACKING.
WE'RE NOT MOVING.

35:02.371 --> 35:04.333
DON'T YOU SEE
HOW GREAT THIS IS?

35:04.333 --> 35:06.435
LIVING IN NEW YORK,
GETTING PAID TO PAINT--

35:06.435 --> 35:08.277
IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

35:08.277 --> 35:09.538
TO UPROOT OUR FAMILY

35:09.538 --> 35:11.340
AND MOVE SOMEWHERE
WE'VE NEVER LIVED BEFORE?

35:11.340 --> 35:13.682
SO WE'LL GO FOR A FEW WEEKS
AND SEE HOW WE LIKE IT.

35:13.682 --> 35:16.415
SUSAN, YOU DO KNOW THAT IF
CHUCK WANTS TO TAKE YOU DOWN,

35:16.415 --> 35:18.417
MOVING TO NEW YORK'S
NOT GONNA STOP HIM.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.189
I KNOW THAT.

35:20.189 --> 35:22.851
WELL, THEN WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
GIVE UP THE LIFE WE HAVE HERE,

35:22.851 --> 35:24.553
AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

35:24.553 --> 35:27.626
BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.599
BEFORE, ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS LOOK OUT THAT WINDOW

35:30.599 --> 35:32.461
AND I'D SEE A TRUE FRIEND--

35:32.461 --> 35:35.133
SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR ME OR MY FAMILY,

35:35.133 --> 35:37.336
BUT NOW...

35:37.336 --> 35:38.537
IT'S ALL GONE.

35:38.537 --> 35:42.311
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND THAT
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

35:42.311 --> 35:43.672
YOU'RE JUST RUNNING.

35:43.672 --> 35:46.545
OKAY. SO I'M RUNNING.

35:46.545 --> 35:50.849
MIKE, IF I GET CAUGHT, I COULD
GO AWAY FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.522
SO IN THE MEANTIME,

35:53.522 --> 35:56.625
WHY NOT TRY TO LIVE
THE LIFE I'VE DREAMED OF?

35:56.625 --> 35:58.627
IT'S NOT MY DREAM.

35:58.627 --> 36:00.629
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEED TO DO,

36:00.629 --> 36:02.261
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.542
HELLO, GABY.
 (Juanita) CELIA, GET BACK HERE!

36:13.542 --> 36:15.744
IS THIS A BAD TIME?
 GIVE ME THAT NOW! CELIA!

36:15.744 --> 36:18.507
UH, CHUCK, I HAVE
2 DAUGHTERS UNDER 13.

36:18.507 --> 36:19.878
IT'S ALWAYS A BAD TIME.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.751
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST STEP
OUTSIDE HERE FOR A SECOND?

36:28.557 --> 36:30.559
SO DID YOU TALK TO CARLOS?

36:30.559 --> 36:32.921
HE'S OBVIOUSLY ASHAMED
OF HIS AFFAIR. THE WHOREMONGER.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.964
BUT AT LEAST HE'S HONEST
ABOUT IT.

36:35.964 --> 36:38.497
NO. I WOUND UP
TAKING A DIFFERENT ANGLE

36:38.497 --> 36:39.728
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

36:39.728 --> 36:42.200
ACTUALLY, YOU WERE
THE REASON FOR THAT.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.733
ME? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:44.733 --> 36:49.238
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY?

36:49.238 --> 36:50.739
VAGUELY.

36:50.739 --> 36:52.581
I REMEMBER IT VIVIDLY,

36:52.581 --> 36:54.443
'CAUSE IT WAS
THE ODDEST THING--

36:54.443 --> 36:57.546
YOU SEE, WHEN SUSAN SAW THIS
PICTURE, SHE NEARLY PASSED OUT.

36:57.546 --> 36:59.518
AND WHEN LYNETTE SAW IT,

36:59.518 --> 37:03.221
SHE WILLED HERSELF
INTO NOT REACTING.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.424
BUT YOU...

37:05.424 --> 37:06.755
YOU SMIRKED.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.001
THAT'S CRAZY.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

37:13.001 --> 37:15.404
SAME QUESTION I ASKED MYSELF.

37:15.404 --> 37:19.738
SO I STARTED DOING SOME DIGGING
INTO YOUR BACKGROUND.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.009
TURNS OUT,

37:21.009 --> 37:25.013
RAMON SANCHEZ,
FORMERLY OF OKLAHOMA,

37:25.013 --> 37:28.677
IS ACTUALLY...

37:28.677 --> 37:30.579
ALEJANDRO PEREZ...

37:32.451 --> 37:34.252
YOUR STEPFATHER.

37:35.484 --> 37:37.526
AND YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT.

37:37.526 --> 37:41.590
OH, COME ON, CHUCK.
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE WHO--

37:41.590 --> 37:43.862
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD SAY ANYTHING

37:43.862 --> 37:45.594
WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT.

37:45.594 --> 37:47.866
WAIT. AM I UNDER ARREST?

37:47.866 --> 37:49.338
NOT YET.

37:49.338 --> 37:51.940
BUT BASED ON THIS, I HAVE TO
START AN OFFICIAL CASE FILE.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.872
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO COME DOWN TO HEADQUARTERS

37:53.872 --> 37:57.576
FOR AN INTERVIEW.
BE THERE TOMORROW AT 10:00.

38:00.549 --> 38:03.512
AND, GABY, IF YOU DON'T...

38:03.512 --> 38:05.884
I'LL SEND A SQUAD CAR
TO GET YOU.

38:22.431 --> 38:24.002
HI. I NEED TO SPEAK WITH
CARLOS SOLIS IMMEDIATELY.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.774
I'M SORRY, BUT MR. SOLIS--
 Yeah, I know.

38:25.774 --> 38:27.406
I KNOW YOU HAVE THAT
ANNOYING NO-CONTACT POLICY,

38:27.406 --> 38:28.937
BUT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

38:28.937 --> 38:31.480
MR. SOLIS ISN'T HERE. HE CHECKED
HIMSELF OUT TWO HOURS AGO.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.782
WHAT?
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

38:33.782 --> 38:36.545
He was not in a mood
to be stopped.

38:37.746 --> 38:40.018
(beep)

38:41.790 --> 38:44.793
BEN, ARE YOU IN THERE?

38:44.793 --> 38:48.427
I'M WEARING LEATHER
AND I'M GETTING COLD.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.100
BEN?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.638
(door closes,
footsteps approach)

39:06.945 --> 39:11.680
(car door closes, engine starts)

39:26.635 --> 39:29.638
(beeping)

39:31.600 --> 39:33.872
BREE, NO NEED TO CALL ME BACK.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.874
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

39:35.874 --> 39:38.477
MY UNOFFICIAL INVESTIGATION'S
ABOUT TO GO OFFICIAL.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.909
BE AT THE STATION
TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00.

39:40.909 --> 39:42.080
BRING A LAWYER.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.782
(beep)

39:43.782 --> 39:45.013
AAH!

39:54.863 --> 39:58.497
JUST WHEN MY FRIENDS
NEEDED EACH OTHER MOST,

39:58.497 --> 40:01.830
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES
UTTERLY ALONE--

40:01.830 --> 40:07.706
ONE WITH THE FRANTIC NEED
TO FIND HER HUSBAND...

40:09.638 --> 40:15.814
ONE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF
REVEALING A PAINFUL SECRET...

40:15.814 --> 40:21.950
AND ONE WITH THE FEELING THAT
SHE SIMPLY NO LONGER BELONGED.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.656
BUT FOR ONE OF MY FRIENDS,

40:27.656 --> 40:30.799
THE SENSE OF ISOLATION
WAS SO COMPLETE...

40:30.799 --> 40:32.501
HERE YOU GO.

40:32.501 --> 40:35.063
THERE MIGHT BE NO ESCAPING IT.

40:35.063 --> 40:36.805
CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST
RUNS TILL 10:30,

40:36.805 --> 40:39.568
BUT THE GOOD STUFF'S GONE
BY 8:00.

40:39.568 --> 40:41.169
OH, I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE HAVING BREAKFAST.

40:41.169 --> 40:43.742
THANK YOU.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.514
SUIT YOURSELF.

41:15.574 --> 41:20.148
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WONDERFUL
THINGS USED TO BE ON THE LANE?

41:23.111 --> 41:24.713
(chuckles)

41:24.713 --> 41:28.787
I HAD THE PERFECT LIFE.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.960
DOCTOR HUSBAND...

41:31.960 --> 41:35.163
TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN...

41:35.163 --> 41:37.896
OH, AND SUCH DEAR FRIENDS.

41:40.268 --> 41:41.630
(sniffles)

41:41.630 --> 41:43.532
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:43.532 --> 41:46.575
HOW DID I LOSE IT ALL?

41:47.976 --> 41:50.508
THINGS CHANGE, BREE.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.142
I'M SO UNHAPPY.

42:02.050 --> 42:03.952
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

42:08.627 --> 42:10.929
I'M NOT UNHAPPY.
