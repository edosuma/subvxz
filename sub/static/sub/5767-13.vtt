*

00:10.810 --> 00:13.005
(sighs)

00:18.680 --> 00:21.012
(elevator bell clings)

00:25.820 --> 00:27.811
May I?

00:27.860 --> 00:30.055
Oh. Uh, no, sorry.

00:30.090 --> 00:33.696
I'm, uh, saving them.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.591
This isn't a game,
Mr. Stack.

00:36.630 --> 00:37.722
I didn't say it was.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.725
You're treating it
like it is.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.795
I'm treating it with all
the respect it deserves.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.159
ALICIA:
Mr. Stack?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.166
Mr. Dylan Stack?
Yes.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.837
Present.
Hi, I'm Alicia Florrick.

00:45.870 --> 00:48.179
We spoke on the phone.
Yes. Nice to meet you.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.178
This is a mistake,
Mr. Stack.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.519
You walk through that door,
we can't help you.

00:52.550 --> 00:55.212
Well, what if
I walk through that door?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.846
What was that about?

00:58.890 --> 01:01.154
Posturing. Heh.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.682
ALICIA:
Before we begin, Mr. Stack,

01:04.730 --> 01:06.652
I just want to warn you

01:06.700 --> 01:08.622
that we are a full-service firm.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.766
We don't really take walk-ins.
Oh, well, I'm...

01:11.800 --> 01:13.734
I'm not technically a walk-in.

01:13.770 --> 01:14.691
I called you.
Yes,

01:14.740 --> 01:16.867
ten minutes ago,
saying you were walking in.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.107
Sorry. I don't like
reservations.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.244
I can pay.
For. . .?

01:22.280 --> 01:23.440
Keeping me out of jail.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.448
Are you in danger
of going to jail?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.471
Yes. The two men out there

01:28.520 --> 01:30.784
are federal agents
from the Treasury.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.118
They've been following me
for the last two days.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.411
ALICIA:
Why?

01:34.460 --> 01:35.882
I won't reveal_the name
of my client.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.558
Okay.
Oh, no, 1-1 mean...

01:37.590 --> 01:39.194
that's why they're following me.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.136
Hello.

01:46.170 --> 01:48.263
If you're agents
from the US. Treasury

01:48.300 --> 01:49.699
and I ask to see your badges,

01:49.740 --> 01:51.162
you have to show me them,
correct?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.631
May I see your badges,
gentlemen?

02:00.280 --> 02:02.145
Actually, could you
hold them higher?

02:04.190 --> 02:07.284
STACK:
I practice digital information
law in New York.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.788
The U.S. Treasury wants to
arrest one of my clients,

02:09.830 --> 02:14.654
a client who asked that
I maintain his anonymity.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.395
This is a subpoena

02:16.430 --> 02:17.590
to submit to questioning,

02:17.630 --> 02:20.690
or be imprisoned for 18 months.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.435
Why have you come to us?

02:23.470 --> 02:25.404
To you, actually.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.737
The rumor is

02:26.780 --> 02:28.930
you've had your own dealings
with the Treasury.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.198
Dealings in which
you came out the victor.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.219
Well, I think that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.582
And as I was saying, we do

02:36.620 --> 02:37.780
have a pretty stable client...

02:41.420 --> 02:44.218
I don't like credit cards
or checks.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.490
That's a lot of money.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.895
It is.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.262
Is it counterfeit?
No, why?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.927
Well, the involvement
of the U.S. Treasury

02:51.970 --> 02:54.768
would suggest some
reason for... concern.
No.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.837
They're after my client for...
something else.

02:57.870 --> 02:58.962
DIANE:
And what is that?

02:59.010 --> 03:00.739
He invented a new currency.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.876
Really?

03:03.910 --> 03:05.207
How did he do that?

03:05.250 --> 03:07.718
He invented Bitcoin.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.218
It's a... digital currency.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.354
It's traded_ and
spent onllne.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.608
Yes. I've read about it.
Well, according to the FBI,

03:14.660 --> 03:17.879
it is a violation of
federal law for individuals

03:17.930 --> 03:21.252
to create private coin
or currency systems.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.497
I think the Treasury feels...
threatened.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.566
WILL:
Bitcoin?

03:26.600 --> 03:28.261
DIANE:
Yes. It's an online currency.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.336
But he's not going to
pay us in Bitcoin, is he?

03:30.370 --> 03:32.509
No, he's got cash.
Lots of it, in fact.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.576
I don't know, Diane.
It's the U.S. Government.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.999
We swore off these Charge-
of-the-Light-Brigade suits.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.268
We swore off the ones
based on Idealism.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.242
This one has cash.
And I know how that sounds.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.486
Okay.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.647
But let's not stick
our necks out too far.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.317
When we poke the bear?

03:46.360 --> 03:50.023
I'm tired. I mix metaphors
when I'm tired.

03:50.060 --> 03:51.357
How's it going?

03:51.390 --> 03:53.358
Well, she sure is different.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.651
You can always get
Kurt Leventhal.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.327
I have his number right here.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.598
No. I rolled the dice.

03:57.630 --> 03:58.927
ELSBETH:
Hey, what time are they...

03:58.970 --> 04:01.393
Oh. Here they are. Hello.
WILL:
Here I go.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.907
DIANE:
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.032
ELSBETH: This way.
You visit me in prison?

04:04.070 --> 04:06.277
Every Friday.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.843
I'm putting on a good face.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.017
I'm actually kind of terrified.

04:13.050 --> 04:14.779
That makes sense.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.287
Ooh. (laughs)

04:16.320 --> 04:18.015
I thought you were gonna
say something comforting,

04:18.050 --> 04:19.278
like, "Don't be."

04:19.320 --> 04:20.787
Sorry.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.788
Well, I guess the truth
is comforting, too.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.582
DIANE:
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Stack.

04:24.630 --> 04:27.292
We have agreed
to take your case.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.991
Oh. That's great.
Thank you.

04:29.030 --> 04:30.361
But we can't
receive the cash.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.539
We need a cashier's check.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.299
Yep.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.333
Only in America is greater
abstraction more desirable.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.338
ELSBETH:
I am so sorry.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.974
They found asbestos
in my office.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.602
This is fine, thank you.

04:44.650 --> 04:47.312
Mr. Gardner, this is
a proffer session.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.409
It's completely...
Would you like something

04:49.450 --> 04:50.940
to drink?

04:50.990 --> 04:53.311
No, thank you.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.782
It's completely off the record.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.651
If you give me...
ELSBETH:
How about you two?

04:56.690 --> 04:57.782
Oh, I'm fine.
No, thank you.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.627
Well, do you mind
ifI have something?

04:59.660 --> 05:01.059
I didn't have breakfast.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.523
Oh, and, um...
we have blankets,

05:03.570 --> 05:04.628
you know, if anybody's cold.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.433
(chuckles) Hi.

05:06.470 --> 05:09.462
Just one morning
shake, please.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.534
Thanks.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.401
Sorry. Go ahead.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.374
If you supply us
with truthful information

05:16.410 --> 05:17.570
as to your knowledge

05:17.610 --> 05:20.477
about judicial
criminal conduct,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.340
we'll close this investigation
against you.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.618
No grand jury.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.538
Does that make sense?
It does.

05:25.590 --> 05:29.378
The... the name
of your bookie was...

05:29.430 --> 05:31.057
Give me a hand
with this.

05:31.090 --> 05:33.354
...was Jonathan Meade,
is that correct?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.049
Jonathan Meade was the name
of a friend of mine

05:35.100 --> 05:36.499
who I invited to one of my

05:36.530 --> 05:37.667
Wednesday night
basketball games.

05:37.700 --> 05:38.962
But he acted as a bookie?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.991
He acted in a lot of capacities.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.565
At one point,
he was even an actor.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.464
Really? In what?

05:45.510 --> 05:46.977
I... I don't know,

05:47.010 --> 05:48.500
but I think it was
a low-budget movie.

05:48.540 --> 05:51.100
A horror movie?
And you Witnessed

05:51.150 --> 05:53.448
several judges placing
bets with Jonathan Meade?

05:53.480 --> 05:55.516
Could you be more specific?
Regarding?

05:55.550 --> 05:57.108
Which three judges?
Excuse me, Ms. Tascioni,

05:57.150 --> 05:58.742
this is Mr. Gardner's proffer,
not ours.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.018
Oh, yes, I know, but

06:00.060 --> 06:02.426
Mr. Gardner needs to know
what you're after

06:02.460 --> 06:03.984
in order to help you.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.554
There were a
lot of judges

06:05.590 --> 06:07.148
at this basketball game
over the years,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.553
and how many of them
talked to your actor friend?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.397
Quite a few.
You see?

06:10.430 --> 06:13.558
How can we help you if you won't
give us any direction

06:13.600 --> 06:15.591
on how to help you?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.169
Judge Winter,

06:22.210 --> 06:23.541
Judge Dunaway,

06:23.580 --> 06:24.877
and Judge Parks.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.413
WE_NDY:
Okay, now It's your turn,
Mr. Gardner.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.179
Did you see Mr. Meade
placing any bets

06:29.220 --> 06:31.541
or otherwise conferring
with these three judges?

06:35.790 --> 06:37.951
I'm sorry.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.992
I wish I could remember.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.422
That was a sham.

06:44.470 --> 06:47.064
She played you.
Yes, thank you, Cary.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.206
This investigator that you're
cultivating at Lockhart/Gardner?

06:50.240 --> 06:51.798
KaHnda?
Mm-hmm.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.104
It's time to stop cultivating,
and start planting.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.232
Okay.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.909
We need to have a conversation
about vulnerabilities.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.212
Here's the difficulty:

07:00.250 --> 07:02.218
I don't know
where I'm vulnerable.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.808
Well, I'd start looking,

07:03.850 --> 07:06.853
because... oh, look,
there's my earring!

07:08.560 --> 07:12.553
NARRATOR:
Dollar bills can be lost,
stolen, burned.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.091
Bitcoin is here forever,
on the Internet.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.064
While dollar bills are traded
through a bank,

07:17.100 --> 07:19.159
Bitcoin is traded
peer-to-peer.
Yay!

07:19.200 --> 07:21.031
See, Mom? Pretty colors.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.196
Fun, right?

07:22.240 --> 07:23.764
Thanks, Zach.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.936
So...

07:24.970 --> 07:26.574
you don't buy Bitcoin.

07:26.610 --> 07:27.736
NISA:
No, you can.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.179
There are currency traders
online.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.246
Yeah, one Bitcoin's worth
three dollars.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.578
It used to be $33.
People were hoarding.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.509
ZACH:
But that's not how it gets
into circulation. You mine it.

07:36.550 --> 07:39.246
Like gold. The guy who invented
it created this program

07:39.290 --> 07:41.554
that releases blocks
of Bitcoin over time.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.581
See?
NARRATOR:
That means running software

07:43.630 --> 07:45.222
on your computer
that works to solve

07:45.260 --> 07:47.524
complicated mathematical
problems.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.824
You receive a Bitcoin
when your computer succeeds.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.622
The more computer power
you have,

07:51.670 --> 07:52.989
the more mining you can do.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.530
Once you have Bitcoins...

07:54.570 --> 07:56.538
So you're representing
the inventor, Mrs. Florrick.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.606
That's really cool.
Just his lawyer, Nisa.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.629
Bit less cool.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.738
ZACH:
It's like this big mystery.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.647
The guy who invented Bitcoin.
Nobody knows who he is.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.875
He's supposed to be this
genius cryptographer,

08:05.910 --> 08:07.810
because no one's been able
to break the Bitcoin code yet.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.010
Yeah, my father thinks
he's a Japanese programmer.

08:09.050 --> 08:11.610
ZACH:
I heard Irish.
Okay. Well.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.517
Thanks for your help.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.154
This stuff makes me
feel so... dated.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.888
NISA:
I have to go.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.158
I love you.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.667
ZACH :
Love you, too.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.588
(kissing sounds)

08:25.630 --> 08:27.791
Good morning, Your Honor.
Good morning, Mr. Higgs.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.933
You're representing the U.S.
Treasury today, correct?

08:29.970 --> 08:31.164
Yes, Your Honor.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.132
Good. 'Caus_e I have
some complaints about

08:33.180 --> 08:34.977
my Susan B. Anthony
silver dollars.

08:36.010 --> 08:38.308
Oh. Well...

08:38.350 --> 08:39.942
That-that was before my time.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.641
No, seriously.
What were they thinking?

08:41.680 --> 08:42.817
They feel like quarters.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.317
HIGGS:
Well, again, I wasn't here,

08:44.350 --> 08:45.681
but I can ask around.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.153
Oh, please. Please do.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.317
Ah. Mrs. Florrick. Hello.
Good morning, Your Honor.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.681
So, uh... money--
that's why we're here today?

08:51.730 --> 08:52.651
HIGGS:
Oh, yes, Your Honor.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.894
Mrs. Florrick's client

08:53.930 --> 08:55.818
represents a criminal,
Mr. Bitcoin.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.566
Excuse me.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.567
Mr. Bitcoin?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.591
HIGGS:
Yes. That's what we've
come to designate

09:00.640 --> 09:03.768
the mysterious creator
of this new Internet currency.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.607
Ah.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.699
Do you guys at Treasury
get a lot of dates?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.604
Yes, we do.
Um... thank you for asking.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.709
And why is this so important?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.968
We believe this unregulated
currency is being used

09:16.020 --> 09:17.146
in a digital black market,

09:17.190 --> 09:21.650
guaranteeing anonymity to money
launderers, drug dealers,

09:21.690 --> 09:23.157
and child pornographers.
And Mr. Bitcoin

09:23.190 --> 09:26.353
is attempting to guarantee
his own anonymity

09:26.390 --> 09:29.666
through the smokescreen
of attorney-client privilege.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.292
I don't think I would call
attorney-client prIVIlege

09:31.330 --> 09:32.262
a smokescreen, Your Honor.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.938
This privilege protects
communications between

09:33.970 --> 09:36.097
a lawyer and his client,
not the client's identity.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.903
ALICIA:
Unless his identity

09:37.940 --> 09:40.238
is the subject
of these communications.
With one exception.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.602
The "crime fraud exception,"
which requires that

09:43.650 --> 09:44.605
Mr. Stack
reveal Mr. Bitcoin

09:44.650 --> 09:46.675
if he's in the process
of committing a crime.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.119
Which has not been established.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.788
(wry laugh)

09:49.820 --> 09:51.219
You know, folks,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.115
I always wait in
court patiently

09:53.160 --> 09:55.355
for these little
conundrums.

09:55.390 --> 09:56.482
That is why God made me a judge.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.829
So that I could decide on
motions exactly like this.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.794
So... eeny, meeny,

10:00.830 --> 10:02.695
miny, moe.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.464
That's a joke, folks.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.764
Government's
motion is denied.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.028
(bangs gavel)

10:08.070 --> 10:10.209
STACK:
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.403
Now I have to go meet with
some Occupy Wall Streeters.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.930
New clients?

10:14.980 --> 10:16.402
Yes, but...

10:16.440 --> 10:17.839
these don't pay as well.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.869
Hello again.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.741
You're under arrest,
Mr. Stack.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.645
You heard the judge's ruling.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.840
Yes, that attorney-client
Privilege applies.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.812
I don't agree, but
I respect the law.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.884
Then we're done.
No, we're not.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.718
I'm arresting Mr. Stack
for being

10:30.760 --> 10:31.988
Mr. Bitcoin.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.691
Oh, come on!
I am coming on.

10:33.730 --> 10:35.698
Mr. Stack presents
himself as a lawyer

10:35.730 --> 10:37.823
representing the
mysterious Mr. Bitcoin,

10:37.870 --> 10:40.737
but we've come to _realize
he is Mr. Bitc0in,

10:40.770 --> 10:42.704
and the penalty for
creating a currency

10:42.740 --> 10:45.231
is ten to 30 years.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.238
You're under arrest,
Mr. Stack.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.168
(handcuffs clicking)

11:04.430 --> 11:05.727
Your Honor, Mr. Higgs
does not believe

11:05.760 --> 11:06.920
that my client
is Mr. Bitcoin.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.450
He is using this arrest
to apply pressure

11:08.500 --> 11:09.455
in counteraction
to your ruling.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.660
SOBEL_:
Yes, Mr. Higgs,

11:10.700 --> 11:13.794
the timing of the arrest does
seem strangely coincidental.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.432
Bitcoin has incorporated,
Your Honor.

11:15.470 --> 11:16.698
_ Here are
the incorporation papers.

11:16.740 --> 11:17.707
As you can see,

11:17.740 --> 11:21.335
the only signature evident
is that of Mr. Stack.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.302
Because he's Bitcoin's lawyer,
not its creator.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.339
Bitcoin has
subcontractors:

11:24.380 --> 11:26.143
computer entrepreneurs
who supply

11:26.180 --> 11:28.171
animation or random coding.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.485
As you can see from these
affidavits, their only contact

11:31.520 --> 11:32.987
was with Mr. Stack.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.851
Because M_r. Bitcoin
wanted to remain anonymous.

11:34.890 --> 11:35.914
Really, Mrs. Florrick,

11:35.960 --> 11:38.485
must_we_all use
"Mr. Bitcom" now?

11:38.530 --> 11:39.679
Occam's razor,
Your Honor.

11:39.730 --> 11:43.427
The person signing the checks,
incorporating and becoming

11:43.470 --> 11:45.859
the public face of a company
is the company.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.733
Your Honor, those documents
don't prove anything.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.431
But they are evocative.

11:50.470 --> 11:53.507
And I must say, I am a
sucker for Occam's razor.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.202
So I will grant
Mr. Stack bail

11:56.240 --> 11:59.869
and,uh,hear
arguments tomorrow.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.979
(bangs gavel)

12:02.020 --> 12:03.885
Good to see
you again.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.740
Always a pleasure.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.882
DIANE:
The difficulty here

12:06.920 --> 12:08.217
is proving a negative.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.125
How do we prove
Dylan isn't his client

12:10.160 --> 12:11.752
if we can't prove someone
else is his client?

12:11.790 --> 12:14.020
Does he know you're in trouble,
Dylan, your client?

12:14.060 --> 12:15.197
Can he help us?

12:15.230 --> 12:16.766
I'm sorry,
but I can't say anything

12:16.800 --> 12:19.018
without breaking
attorney-client privilege.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.469
(sighs)

12:20.500 --> 12:22.058
DIANE: Okay, so hit the
incorporation papers--

12:22.100 --> 12:23.806
that's not proof
of ownership.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.398
No, play offense, not defense.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.407
How?

12:26.440 --> 12:28.078
_ Bitcoin
isn't a currency.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.772
_ _ There's no crime _
if Bitcom is a commodity--

12:30.810 --> 12:32.914
just something to be traded
like a bushel of fruit.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.872
DIANE:
Mr. Gardner taps

12:34.920 --> 12:36.410
his inner rebel.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.213
Good, we have
our strategy in court.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.309
And outside court?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.954
Was there anything said by your
client that would prevent us

12:42.990 --> 12:45.254
from hunting him down
independenﬂy?

12:45.290 --> 12:46.951
I cannot help you

12:47.000 --> 12:49.298
without breaking
attorney-client privilege.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.922
But we can do it on our own?

12:50.970 --> 12:53.837
Again, I cannot help you.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.838
KALIN DA:
Well, the inventor has left

12:55.870 --> 12:57.007
a few fingerprints.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.304
He wrote a manifesto
when Bitcom came out.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.570
I could use linguistic
analysis to run him down.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.146
WILL: Good. And look for
contact points with Stack.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.306
When did they meet?

13:04.350 --> 13:05.476
Where?

13:05.510 --> 13:07.512
DIANE: You might
try Decode-a-Con.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.587
What, it's not on
your social calendar?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.417
Stack is here
for Decode-a-Con,

13:12.450 --> 13:14.452
the conference of
cryptographers.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.412
Good. Maybe they were
meeting there.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.586
Okay, I'm on it.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.257
Uh, one thing we
might consider.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.121
What?

13:21.160 --> 13:22.252
It could be him.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.359
(elevator bell dings)

13:36.610 --> 13:38.305
I am vulnerable.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.113
It's innocent, but it looks bad.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.139
Okay.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.841
Are you sure you
want to tell me?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.517
Subpoenas
could go out.

13:44.550 --> 13:48.486
When I stopped gambling,
this friend--

13:48.520 --> 13:51.421
my bookie--
Jonathan Meade,

13:51.460 --> 13:53.098
he forgave my debt.

13:53.130 --> 13:54.324
How much?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.123
$8,000.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.993
It's not much,
but it could look like

13:59.030 --> 14:01.169
a payoff for setting him up
with these judges.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.337
But it wasn't?

14:02.370 --> 14:03.632
I didn't
take it that way.

14:03.670 --> 14:04.762
This guy was a friend.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.871
My guess is Wendy is trying
to tie it to a case we won.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.138
They're looking
at three judges:

14:10.180 --> 14:12.148
Winter, Dunaway, Parks.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.977
Could you look at
our cases before them?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.942
I want to anticipate
which one they'll hit.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.947
Sure.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.648
How are you holding up?

14:20.690 --> 14:23.352
I don't want to go to jail.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.298
Up until this week,
I never thought I would.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.662
It's making you more human.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.362
(laughs)

14:36.400 --> 14:38.231
That's not much of a trade-off.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.259
(both chuckle)

14:39.310 --> 14:40.937
Jim Cramer. I am a former
hedge fund manager,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.504
author and current
host of Mad Money.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.974
HIGGS:
Your Honor, we take
this case very seriously.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.671
Obviously, Mrs. Florrick
does not.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.678
Is there an objection
in there somewhere, Mr. Higgs?

14:48.720 --> 14:51.018
We object to the defense
questioning this TV personality

14:51.050 --> 14:52.312
as an expert in currency.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.988
SOBEL:
Hmm, well, let me
think about that.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.988
Overruled.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.159
ALICIA:
Mr. Cramer, do you consider
Bitcoin a currency?

14:58.190 --> 14:59.623
No, I don't.

14:59.660 --> 15:00.490
It has none of
the characteristics

15:00.530 --> 15:01.929
_ associated with
c0inage and currency.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.496
In what way?

15:03.530 --> 15:04.565
There's no central
bank to regulate it,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.420
it's digital and functions
completely peer-to-peer.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.391
Thank you, Mr. Cramer.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.498
You're welcome, ma'am.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.433
Mr. Cramer,
are you the TV personality

15:12.470 --> 15:14.631
who regularly shouts
and badgers on Mad Money?

15:14.680 --> 15:17.979
Well, I think "badger"
is debatable,

15:18.010 --> 15:19.944
but, yes, I have a
very, dare I say,

15:19.980 --> 15:21.618
flamboyant personality
on my TV program.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.288
And you use various beeps

15:23.320 --> 15:25.641
and honking sounds
on your program,

15:25.690 --> 15:27.715
and sometimes clench a knife
between your teeth?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.955
I would call it a scimitar
more than a knife.

15:29.990 --> 15:31.685
And, yes, I do employ beeps.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.254
Why aren't you
objecting?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.597
Because the judge is.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.962
HIGGS:
So why on earth should this
court take you seriously?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.024
For the reason

15:38.070 --> 15:40.095
you would any man:
the solidity of my arguments.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.493
So you would
ask this court to ignore

15:41.540 --> 15:43.269
the ass you make of yourself
on TV?

15:43.310 --> 15:44.959
SOBEL: _
Excuse me, Mr. Higgs.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.934
May I ask you please to be more
cordial in your questioning?

15:49.710 --> 15:51.439
Uh...

15:51.480 --> 15:52.742
Thank you.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.714
My apologies,
Mr. Cramer.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.980
I'm a great fan of your show,
by the way.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.317
Thank you.
No apologies.

15:58.350 --> 15:59.510
Was it Montaigne who said,

15:59.550 --> 16:03.281
"How many valiant men can
survive their own reputation"?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.558
No further questions.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.363
(overlapping talking)

16:19.370 --> 16:21.474
MAN:
Our software blocks
both schemes,

16:21.510 --> 16:24.070
creating pre-image resistance

16:24.110 --> 16:26.749
and creating a secondary
pre-image resistance...

16:26.780 --> 16:28.771

by The Bangles playing)

16:28.820 --> 16:33.553
* Ay, 0h, ay, oh,
ay, oh, ay, oh... *

16:33.590 --> 16:35.387
So, hieroglyphics were
the first cryptograms.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.321
The Egyptians, like companies
and governments today,

16:38.360 --> 16:39.679
strove to protect their
sensitive information...

16:39.730 --> 16:41.391
MAN:

the 2009 abstract

16:41.430 --> 16:43.227
that speaks directly

WOMAN:
Of course I'm familiar
with the study,

16:44.530 --> 16:46.760
but the methodology
is completely flawed.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.199
MAN: _
Is leakage ineVItable?

16:48.240 --> 16:50.105
Leakage is never inevitable.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.131
C++ allows for some restrictions

16:52.170 --> 16:53.808
based on the complexity
of the leakage.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.102
Okay?

16:55.140 --> 16:56.630
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

Hey.

17:13.130 --> 17:16.429
Sorry. This is the only place
I can get some peace and quiet.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.427
Oh, no problem.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.664
It's quite a scene, isn't it?

17:18.700 --> 17:21.669
Oh, just wait
till the Crypto-Bash.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.429
There's nothing like a bunch
of drunk cryptographers.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.716
St. Mary's High.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.217
(laughs)

17:40.260 --> 17:42.785
I did a linguistic match
on the Bitcoin manifesto,

17:42.820 --> 17:45.084
and guess what popped up?

17:45.130 --> 17:48.190
A patent application by one
of the Ten Hottest Geek Women.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.356
Oh, God.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.220
That'll be on my tombstone.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.489
No Nobel, no MHV,
just Third-Hottest Geek Woman.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.496
Everybody's looking
for Mr. Bitcoin,

17:56.540 --> 17:59.703
when in fact, they don't realize
it's Mrs. Bitcoin.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.776
(chuckles)

18:01.810 --> 18:03.846
You have a linguistic tic,
Ms. Middleton.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.269
"Theoretically established
combinatorial properties."

18:06.310 --> 18:10.883
It's an odd little phrase
that you've used exactly twice.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.481
Once in a patent application
and once in the manifesto.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.853
Actually, you'll find that odd
phrasing used three times.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.291
Once by me,
once in the manifesto,

18:21.330 --> 18:24.561
and once by
a Chinese econophysicist

18:24.600 --> 18:29.663
from Nankai University who goes
by the code name: NewMint91.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.906
Really?

18:30.940 --> 18:33.170
And why does NewMint91
use that phrasing?

18:33.210 --> 18:35.678
He has a crush on me.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.200
And he steals things.

18:37.250 --> 18:37.841
"Hell?

18:37.880 --> 18:39.507
So, you've met him?

18:39.550 --> 18:40.744
Yeah, actually, just today

18:40.780 --> 18:42.418
for the first time
at the conference.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.519
Bao Shuwei.

18:43.550 --> 18:46.212
(phone buzzing)

18:46.250 --> 18:47.182
Thanks.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.448
Hello there.

18:48.490 --> 18:49.616
DANA:
Hello there, yourself.

18:49.660 --> 18:50.820
What are you doing?

18:50.860 --> 18:52.179
Attending Decode-a-Con.

18:52.230 --> 18:53.356
What about you?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.925
I am staring at a document
you might be interested in.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.394
I thought we could
get together and talk.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.330
Sure. Whenever you want.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.894
How's tomorrow?

19:01.940 --> 19:05.603
Yeah, tomorrow's good.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.902
My name is Mitchell Tambor.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.602
And I stayed at
the Crestview Priority Inn

19:09.640 --> 19:12.347
on the night of
November 18, 2011.

19:12.380 --> 19:13.847
HIGGS:
Thank you, Mr. Tambor.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.247
This room at the Crestview
Priority Inn, tell us about it.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.246
Well, uh, it was nice.

19:19.290 --> 19:21.383
Mr. Higgs, as
much as I cherish

19:21.420 --> 19:24.753
all this time we spend together,

19:24.790 --> 19:26.781
is there some driving point
you want to make?

19:26.830 --> 19:28.559
Yes, Your Honor.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.898
Uh... sorry.

19:30.930 --> 19:34.195
Uh, Mr. Tambor, how did you
purchase this room?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.195
With Bitcoin.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.765
And how much Bitcoin
did one night set you back?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.232
Well, the exchange rate

19:39.270 --> 19:40.806
at the time was approximately

19:40.840 --> 19:45.573
$25 for one Bitcoin,
so I spent 4.32 Bitcoin.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.475
And did you purchase other goods
with this Bitcoin?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.249
An in-room movie, yes.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.383
Good. And what movie was that?

19:51.990 --> 19:53.981
That's okay.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.988
Uh, any other incidentals?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.284
Uh, a Snickers bar
and some peanuts

19:58.330 --> 19:59.285
from the minibar.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.797
And you paid
for all this with

20:00.830 --> 20:01.956
Bitcoin that you mined?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.399
You used it as money?

20:03.430 --> 20:04.567
As currency?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.669
Yes.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.395
No further questions.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.965
No, sir, we just need
a rebuttal witness.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.706
You're not in trouble.

20:11.740 --> 20:12.900
ZACH:
Get home safe, okay?

20:12.940 --> 20:14.100
NISA:
I will.

20:14.140 --> 20:15.971
ZACH:
All right, I'll call you later.
No, I'll hold.

20:16.010 --> 20:18.308
NISA:
Bye.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.949
So, you and Nisa
are getting close.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.483
I guess so.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.841
This was her fourth night
over here.

20:26.890 --> 20:27.982
I thought you liked Nisa.

20:28.020 --> 20:28.782
I do.

20:28.820 --> 20:32.426
But, um, are you
getting too serious?

20:32.460 --> 20:34.496
Mom, we go to
different schools now.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.997
We don't see each other
at school,

20:36.030 --> 20:37.759
so we see each other here.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.360
I know, but maybe you should
slow it down a little.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.799
Why?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.536
Because... you're young.

20:44.570 --> 20:45.969
Because she's young.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.331
You'll meet a lot of people.
She will, too.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.972
Did I do something wrong?

20:50.010 --> 20:53.571
No, no, it's just...

20:53.620 --> 20:55.315
She's over here a lot.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.284
Is this 'cause she's black?

20:58.320 --> 20:59.446
Oh, my God, no.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.650
Zach!

21:00.690 --> 21:02.055
No, you don't
believe that.

21:02.090 --> 21:02.988
I don't know
what to believe, Mom.

21:03.020 --> 21:03.987
You don't want her over here.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.385
Okay, wait a
minute, stop.

21:06.430 --> 21:10.867
You know it's not that,
so don't try to pretend.

21:10.900 --> 21:13.437
I heard you two
saying "I love you."

21:13.470 --> 21:17.668
I'm just worried that it's
moving too fast, that's all.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.702
I'll ask her over here less.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.847
MAN: Hello?
(sighs)

21:25.880 --> 21:26.847
Uh, yes.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.440
Hello, sir.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.549
Great.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.319
Uh, can you meet us at court?

21:32.350 --> 21:33.886
Alex Krakowski.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.388
I'm the manager
of the Crestview Priority Inn.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.250
And you rented Mr. Tambor

21:37.290 --> 21:38.951
the room in question?
That's correct.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.322
This hotel room is taking on
legendary status, isn't it?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.850
And you accepted his Bitcoin?

21:42.900 --> 21:44.026
Yeah.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.061
It's a promotion, so yeah.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.636
And you would also have accepted

21:47.670 --> 21:49.695
his frequent travel miles
in trade for the room?

21:49.740 --> 21:50.707
Yeah.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.059
We have a promotion going.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.429
Priority Inn
frequent travel miles.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.606
But you don't consider

21:54.640 --> 21:56.335
frequent travel miles cash?

21:56.380 --> 21:57.540
ALEX:
What do you mean?

21:57.580 --> 21:59.070
ALICIA:
I mean, you have
a cash register

21:59.110 --> 22:00.338
with a drawer for cash.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.472
Oh, yeah, no.
(chuckles)

22:01.520 --> 22:03.112
We don't have a drawer
for Bitcoin

22:03.150 --> 22:04.617
or frequent travel miles.

22:04.650 --> 22:05.878
So it's more like a trade?

22:05.920 --> 22:09.583
Trading frequent travel miles
for the room?

22:09.620 --> 22:10.518
Uh, yeah.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.549
In other words,

22:11.590 --> 22:14.058
it's a commodity,
not a currency?

22:14.100 --> 22:16.455
Yeah. And we're not gonna do it
much more with Bitcoin.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.889
I thought it would be cool,
but it's a bit of a hassle.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.433
Thank you.
No further questions.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.869
Good morning, Mr. Krakowski.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.764
If you wanted to purchase a book
on Amazon,

22:26.810 --> 22:29.131
could you do it using
the frequent travel miles

22:29.180 --> 22:30.738
you accept at your hotel?

22:30.780 --> 22:33.101
Could I do it?
No, I don't think so.

22:33.150 --> 22:34.617
Because they're
non-transferrable?

22:34.650 --> 22:36.641
Yeah, that's right.
It says right on it.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.113
But you could buy
a book on Amazon

22:38.150 --> 22:39.742
with the cash
from your cash drawer?

22:39.790 --> 22:41.781
Well, no.
You'd have to do it

22:41.820 --> 22:43.651
mmaammam
or something.

22:43.690 --> 22:46.079
But you could also buy the book
with Bitcoin, could you not?

22:46.130 --> 22:48.655
Yeah, I think that's right.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.689
Because Bitcoin
is transferrable,

22:49.730 --> 22:50.765
and therefore a currency?

22:50.800 --> 22:52.097
Okay, okay, I get it.

22:52.130 --> 22:56.499
You know, I'd love to hear more
about this saga

22:56.540 --> 22:59.168
of the Priority Inn
in Crestview,

22:59.210 --> 23:00.472
but I'm ready to rule.

23:00.510 --> 23:03.399
Bitcoin is a currency. There.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.010
Your Honor, Mr. Higgs still
hasn't proved

23:06.050 --> 23:07.142
my client created Bitcoin.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.148
We'll be ready with witnesses
tomorrow, Your Honor.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.978
Good. See the two
of you tomorrow.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.715
(bangs gavel)

23:19.130 --> 23:21.098
(sighs)

23:21.130 --> 23:22.859
I need help on Will Gardner.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.891
I'm getting pressure,

23:24.930 --> 23:27.569
and_ I've been asked
to give you pressure.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.898
And that's what
that's about?

23:29.940 --> 23:31.100
Yes.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.062
You have a choice to make.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.403
People always say "choice" when
I think they mean "ultimatum."

23:40.680 --> 23:42.216
This was slipped
to us last week.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.639
It's highly actionable.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.783
Unless?

23:46.820 --> 23:50.654
Unless you get me something
on Will Gardner.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.727
We need to find which case
makes him most vulnerable.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.990
I like Will.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.863
I go back and
forth on you.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.993
Then don't do it for me.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.741
That is Alicia Florrick's
Signature

24:15.780 --> 24:18.544
_on what we believe
is a forged document

24:18.590 --> 24:21.115
recently sent to us
by an opposing attorney

24:21.160 --> 24:25.256
in a divorce case
against your firm.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.520
That's a felony.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.222
Forging a document
and perjury,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.127
we prove this,
Alicia gets disbarred.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.262
But we don't want her.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.508
We want Will Gardner.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.501
I'm on your side,
Kalinda.

25:04.700 --> 25:05.962
(typing)

25:06.000 --> 25:09.595
KALIN DA:
NewMint91?

25:10.640 --> 25:12.130
Who are you?

25:12.170 --> 25:13.307
Kalinda Sharma.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.103
Your friend, Elaine,
suggested we meet.

25:17.610 --> 25:18.941
Where is she?

25:18.980 --> 25:20.618
I don't know.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.618
It's Bao, right?

25:22.650 --> 25:23.275
Yeah.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.912
Don't you ever just want

25:24.950 --> 25:26.281
to let the secret out?

25:26.320 --> 25:29.289
Scream at the top of your lungs,
"I did it"?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.856
Did what?

25:30.890 --> 25:33.654
Invented Bitcoin.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.825
Okay. Oh, God,

25:39.870 --> 25:41.269
she's getting back at me,
isn't she?

25:41.300 --> 25:44.565
So she sent you?

25:44.610 --> 25:46.009
Getting back at
you for what?

25:46.040 --> 25:47.905
I said I would
leave her alone.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.771
I found out
she invented Bitcoin,

25:49.810 --> 25:53.712
and she threatened me,
so I said I would drop it.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.342
Now she sends you.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.348
No, no, she didn't send me.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.348
I'm not Mr. Bitcoin.

25:59.390 --> 26:00.812
She is.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.351
Anyway, you should check out
the new embedding.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.789
That isn't me.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.183
What isn't you?

26:06.230 --> 26:08.050
(typing)

26:08.100 --> 26:09.590
The newest block of Bitcoin

26:09.630 --> 26:12.667
has a statement
embedded in the code.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.589
A statement?
Mm-hmm.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.834
When did that happen?

26:16.870 --> 26:18.201
Last night.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.935
See?

26:21.640 --> 26:23.301
What does it say?

26:23.340 --> 26:25.240
"Stack is innocent."

26:27.010 --> 26:29.615
ALICIA:
Your Honor, the time code
of the embedding

26:29.650 --> 26:30.912
on this new block
of Bitcoins--

26:30.950 --> 26:33.180
embedding that only
could be put there

26:33.220 --> 26:35.381
by Bitcoin's inventor--

26:35.420 --> 26:36.910
was at exactly the same moment

26:36.960 --> 26:38.257
Mr. Stack was in court
yesterday.

26:38.290 --> 26:39.382
Which means nothing,
Your Honor.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.295
It's the easiest thing
in the world

26:41.330 --> 26:43.298
to arrange
for a delayed embedding.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.321
And in fact, if you were
trying to establish

26:45.370 --> 26:47.691
an alibi, wouldn't you delay
the embedding

26:47.740 --> 26:49.367
for exactly the moment
you were in court?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.209
Or if you were trying
to set Mr. Stack up,

26:51.240 --> 26:52.366
wouldn't you do the same?

26:52.410 --> 26:53.729
So we're back to zero.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.372
What a familiar place.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.139
Not exactly, Your Honor.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.000
Yes, I was one
of the subcontractors hired

26:59.050 --> 27:00.301
to do computation work.

27:00.350 --> 27:03.148
I didn't know it was Bitcoin
at the time.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.886
And all your dealings
were with...?

27:04.920 --> 27:06.114
Mr. Stack there, yes. Hi.

27:06.150 --> 27:07.879
She's gonna set us up.
Why?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.751
Jealousy.

27:09.790 --> 27:10.757
Cryptographer jealousy.

27:10.790 --> 27:11.859
The ugliest kind.

27:11.890 --> 27:13.221
Do you have
an opinion

27:13.260 --> 27:14.989
as to whether Mr. Stack had

27:15.030 --> 27:17.294
the technological capacity
to be Mr. Bitcoin?

27:17.330 --> 27:19.662
Objection. The witness is not
qualified to answer.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.361
Well, she seems
qualified enough to me.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.731
Overruled.

27:22.770 --> 27:23.839
Yes.

27:23.870 --> 27:26.338
Mr. Stack definitely
is qualified to be Mr. Bitcoin.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.031
(door opens)

27:28.080 --> 27:29.775
ZACH:
My dad just keeps this apartment

27:29.810 --> 27:31.243
for when he's working late
in court.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.169
And you're sure it's
all right to work here?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.278
Yeah, he won't mind.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.742
It's better than home.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.385
JACKIE:
Well, look who's here.

27:39.420 --> 27:40.682
Zach.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.951
Hi, Grandma.
How's it going?

27:43.990 --> 27:46.356
And, Nisa, right?

27:46.390 --> 27:48.324
Yes. How are you,
Mrs. Florrick?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.021
Very well, thank you.

27:50.060 --> 27:52.221
I thought you two were
in different schools now.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.398
We are. We're just working
on some homework together.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.396
We're gonna use Dad's study.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.432
And how is public school, Nisa?

28:00.470 --> 28:01.801
It's good, ma'am.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.446
We all miss Zach there.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.916
Well, perhaps he can return
sometimes and say hello.

28:08.950 --> 28:11.748
We hope so.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.417
Bye, ma'am.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.714
We're gonna go listen
to some music,

28:15.760 --> 28:17.978
so it might get a bit loud.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.258
Zach,

28:19.290 --> 28:21.997
I'm surprised you two
are still friends.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.419
I thought you were seeing
Eli Gold's daughter.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.495
What? No.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.930
I mean, she came over
to the apartment once.

28:28.970 --> 28:30.369
She's nice, but
she's in college.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.958
I see.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.376
But she's very young, Zach.

28:34.410 --> 28:37.299
Marissa?
No, Nisa.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.308
She's only a year younger
than me.

28:39.350 --> 28:44.743
Yes, but you have such
different experiences now

28:44.790 --> 28:46.781
that you're in Capstone.

28:46.820 --> 28:50.278
And you don't want to always
be driving across town.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.821
It's not that far.

28:51.860 --> 28:56.092
I just don't want you
to get too serious.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.065
Maybe you should slow it down
a bit.

28:59.100 --> 29:02.490
You'll meet a lot
of different people.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.963
She will, too.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.807
What?

29:06.840 --> 29:07.738
Did I say something?

29:07.780 --> 29:11.272
No, that's just what
my mom said earlier.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.948
Really?

29:14.580 --> 29:17.981
Well, your mother
is probably right.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.788
She just testified against
our client in court.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.254
Yeah, she's trying to deflect
attention from herself.

29:25.290 --> 29:28.919
Can't you help trace the source
of her embedding?

29:28.960 --> 29:32.123
Mmm-mm. She would
have covered her tracks.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.035
Yeah, but if this recent
embedding was done remotely,

29:34.070 --> 29:36.095
can't you trace the IP address?

29:38.870 --> 29:40.167
I probably can.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.575
It won't matter.

29:43.610 --> 29:44.577
She'll have moved on from there.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.272
Yeah, but it will help me
get closer to her.

29:47.310 --> 29:51.280
1270901.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.919
What, do you know it?

29:56.960 --> 29:58.450
It's our IP address.

29:58.490 --> 29:59.457
Ours?

29:59.490 --> 30:00.889
Lockhart/Gardner?

30:00.930 --> 30:02.158
It was embedded
from here?

30:02.200 --> 30:03.258
Yeah.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.597
So we think it's him, and not
this woman who testified?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.460
Yeah.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.162
Well, he's still our client.
We need to represent him.

30:13.210 --> 30:15.906
Yeah, but I'm gonna stop looking
for Mr. Bitcoin.

30:15.940 --> 30:16.770
Oh, I agree.

30:16.810 --> 30:20.371
Um, so you're helping Will
on his issue?

30:20.410 --> 30:22.378
Yeah.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.843
I know Will tries to stay
brave about these things,

30:24.890 --> 30:27.245
but I don't want
to be behind the curve.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.850
You want to know when
to cut your losses?

30:29.890 --> 30:32.484
No. I want to know
when to help.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.927
Okay.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.496
I'll keep you in the loop.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.521
Thank you.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.365
ELSBETH:
$8,000?

30:43.400 --> 30:45.163
That's how much
this actor paid you?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.529
Well, no, he excused my
debt for that amount.

30:46.570 --> 30:49.573
Okay. What else?

30:49.610 --> 30:51.475
Well, we think she'll try to go
after a case, too.

30:51.510 --> 30:52.602
Mmm, I think you're right.

30:52.650 --> 30:53.446
So we reviewed all

30:53.480 --> 30:55.345
_ of our cases
With those three judges.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.644
And we're in good shape
on almost all of them.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.011
Who does
the design in here?

30:59.050 --> 31:00.984
It's very attractive.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.284
I don't know.
I can find out.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.379
That would be great.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.624
The worst is the McDermott case.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.059
Product tampering.
It resulted in

31:08.100 --> 31:10.250
an $8-million judgment
in our favor.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.565
The evidence wasn't with us,
but it went our way anyway.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.464
Why is that?

31:14.500 --> 31:16.593
Sometimes the ball
just bounces funny.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.562
(chuckles)
I like that.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.329
So, was it a jury trial?

31:21.380 --> 31:22.472
No, bench.

31:22.510 --> 31:24.649
Which judge?

31:24.680 --> 31:26.648
Parks.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.649
Okay, I'm gonna ask this

31:29.680 --> 31:31.648
in the most friendly
and objective way possible,

31:31.690 --> 31:34.181
and just understand,
this is not a prod

31:34.220 --> 31:35.187
to do anything,

31:35.220 --> 31:39.350
um, but is there anything
in that file there

31:39.390 --> 31:42.291
any notes or receipts

31:42.330 --> 31:43.968
or nasty little memos
that could

31:44.000 --> 31:45.524
make you look bad?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.663
Yeah. It could make
Will look bad.

31:47.700 --> 31:51.204
Okay.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.504
Good to know.
I'm gonna go now.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.208
(door opens)

31:58.250 --> 32:00.206
(door closes)

32:00.250 --> 32:01.615
What do you want me to do?

32:03.720 --> 32:05.642
I can't ask you to do anything.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.681
I know.

32:20.770 --> 32:23.238
(door opening)

32:36.080 --> 32:38.048
(phone buzzing)

32:38.090 --> 32:38.715
Yeah?

32:38.750 --> 32:40.411
Yeah, it's Bao.

32:40.450 --> 32:42.418
You told me to stay in touch.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.484
Yeah. Bao I'm

32:43.520 --> 32:44.726
a little bit busy right now.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.058
I did a deeper analysis
of the IP address,

32:47.090 --> 32:48.250
where the recent embedding
came from?

32:48.300 --> 32:49.494
Yeah?

32:49.530 --> 32:52.658
Okay, I had to use a large data
set because it was stored on

32:52.700 --> 32:54.099
an untrusted server,
and if I amortized

32:54.140 --> 32:55.539
the verifiable computation...

32:55.570 --> 32:57.265
Yeah, yeah, that's real
interesting, Boa, but no.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.437
The thing is, there was

32:58.470 --> 32:59.732
no protection on
the source computer.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.078
There wasn't?

33:01.110 --> 33:03.101
No, so I could trace it
to the computer

33:03.140 --> 33:04.505
where the embedding was done.

33:04.550 --> 33:05.676
Great. What was it?

33:05.710 --> 33:07.678
It's your computer.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.610
You did not embed
the "Stack is innocent" code

33:15.660 --> 33:18.356
on the new Bitcoins,
Ms. Sharma?

33:18.390 --> 33:20.187
ALICIA:
I'll be answering for her.

33:20.230 --> 33:20.980
No.

33:21.030 --> 33:22.452
And yet we traced
the embedding

33:22.500 --> 33:23.626
to your computer.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.423
Ms. Sharma has nothing
to do with it.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.665
And I would like to bring
the Treasury's attention

33:27.700 --> 33:29.634
to a common computer hacking
practice called ghosting,

33:29.670 --> 33:31.035
in which the hacker
only needs

33:31.070 --> 33:32.105
access to a
paraSIte computer

33:32.140 --> 33:34.779
to get it to do
his or her will.
In other words,

33:34.810 --> 33:36.801
Mr. Stack had access
to Ms. Sharma's computer.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.808
No. To deny
that Ms. Sharma did it

33:38.850 --> 33:40.602
is not to say
that Mr. Stack did.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.211
And yet, as Judge Sobel
might say, it is evocative.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.683
Ms. Sharma has been

33:46.720 --> 33:48.711
independently searching
for Mr. Bitcoin,

33:48.760 --> 33:50.318
and in the process,
she has been

33:50.360 --> 33:53.625
in close proximity
to several key Bitcoin suspects.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.254
Any one of those
could have ghosted her computer.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.621
And would Ms. Sharma like
to share those names?

33:59.670 --> 34:00.796
No.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.263
But thank you.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.066
This is one thing
you might want to consider.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.361
You're representing
a client

34:07.410 --> 34:08.638
who is willing
to set you up

34:08.680 --> 34:10.375
for a federal crime.

34:10.410 --> 34:13.379
That, to me, is not a healthy
attorney-client relationship.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.281
Do you know who did it?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.550
I have a suspicion.

34:23.590 --> 34:26.354
That leaves us with an LR-ZK

34:26.390 --> 34:27.652
interactive proof system
construction

34:27.690 --> 34:29.658
based on standard
general assumptions.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.197
And we'll have to
leave it at that,

34:33.230 --> 34:36.438
because I have someone here
who wants to question me.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.800
ELAINE:
Yep.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.512
Someone ghosted your laptop
a few days ago.

34:50.550 --> 34:52.142
Here's the aftereffect.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.181
Good. Can you
tell who did it?

34:54.220 --> 34:57.314
No, but I can tell you
where it was done.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.588
Would you like that?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.222
I would.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.251
This isn't one of those
Columbo-like things

35:02.300 --> 35:05.326
where you keep me doing things
for you, hoping I'll slip up?

35:05.370 --> 35:07.326
Because I'd rather just confess.

35:07.370 --> 35:08.496
I would rather that, too.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.361
Tell me what I should
be confessing to.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.536
Ghosting my
computer.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.572
Embedding the Bitcoin remotely.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.771
Ah.

35:17.810 --> 35:19.846
Here's something
you should find interesting.

35:19.880 --> 35:23.213
Whoever ghosted your computer
wanted to be found out.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.182
Really?

35:24.220 --> 35:26.415
It's easy to cover
your tracks when you ghost.

35:26.450 --> 35:28.350
They didn't.

35:28.390 --> 35:30.210
It's like they're taunting you.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.387
VVho?
I don't know.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.352
But whoever did it
recently did a search

35:34.400 --> 35:36.152
of the IP addresses
you accessed.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.328
You know who it is?

35:40.370 --> 35:42.395
I know who it is.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.862
So we're back to proving
Stack is innocent?

35:43.900 --> 35:45.538
DIANE:
Maybe there's another way
of proving it.

35:45.570 --> 35:46.639
What?

35:46.670 --> 35:48.171
Treasury doesn't really believe

35:48.210 --> 35:50.804
that our client
is Mr. Bitcoin, do they?

35:50.840 --> 35:52.944
They're just using Stack
to get to him.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.345
Yes.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.574
So prove that.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.747
Prove Higgs is still looking.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.748
That he doesn't think
Stack is the one.

35:59.790 --> 36:00.882
Right.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.150
Good. I'm on it.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.219
See? No Nisa.

36:07.260 --> 36:08.397
I see.

36:10.260 --> 36:12.467
Everything okay with you two?

36:12.500 --> 36:15.435
Mom, you said that we should
be seeing less of each other.

36:15.470 --> 36:16.562
No.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.659
I said maybe you were moving
too fast.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.429
Yeah, that's what Grandma said.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.538
She did?

36:23.580 --> 36:25.548
Uh-huh.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.878
She said that we
should slow down

36:27.910 --> 36:30.310
'cause we're too different.

36:31.350 --> 36:32.544
That's what she said?

36:33.620 --> 36:35.713
She said that it wasn't
a matter of race.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.388
Just that...

36:38.430 --> 36:42.594
I'm in private school
and Nisa's in public school.

36:47.470 --> 36:49.563
Hey, Nisa.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.864
Yeah, come on over.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.629
No, my mom says it's fine.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.249
Bao.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.271
Hey.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.810
So you did it.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.340
Did what?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.243
Come on, Bao.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.588
You're the one
who traced my IP addresses.

37:07.620 --> 37:08.552
You ghosted my computer,

37:08.590 --> 37:10.251
and you wanted me
to find you.

37:10.290 --> 37:11.621
No.
If people knew

37:11.660 --> 37:13.025
you created Bitcoin,

37:13.060 --> 37:14.857
you'd get a lot
of attention.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.891
People would
talk to you.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.899
In fact, you would be the hero
of the Occupy Wall Street crowd.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.569
Have you seen the
Occupy Wall Street women?

37:22.600 --> 37:23.464
They're beautiful.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.935
Are those guys
with you?

37:29.510 --> 37:30.670
No.

37:30.710 --> 37:31.847
I have to go.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.507
Wait, Bao.

37:33.550 --> 37:34.710
Talk to me.
Come on.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.911
Not... not here.
Not with them around.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.986
Okay. Then... let me
get rid of them.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.454
M-my room.

37:42.490 --> 37:45.857
Upstairs-- 2545.

37:47.860 --> 37:51.023
ANNOUNCER:
Please join us
for advanced algorithms

37:51.060 --> 37:52.869
for fast quadrupling
of an elliptic curve point.

37:52.900 --> 37:56.631
Today at 4:00 pm. in room 311.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.399
Do you want something?

37:58.440 --> 38:00.362
Actually, it's what
Mr. Higgs wants.

38:00.410 --> 38:03.607
Tell him to come on down,
and I will give him Mr. Bitcoin.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.540
No.

38:05.580 --> 38:07.343
Bye.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.313
You know, I'm really good
at losing people,

38:10.350 --> 38:11.942
so after I lose you two,

38:11.990 --> 38:14.379
call Mr. Higgs
and tell him to meet me

38:14.420 --> 38:16.980
on the 25th floor
of this hotel.

38:20.530 --> 38:22.521
(elevator bell dings)

38:23.960 --> 38:25.621
Hello.

38:25.670 --> 38:27.626
Hi.
You didn't need to dress up.

38:27.670 --> 38:28.659
Ha-ha.

38:28.700 --> 38:29.598
What do you need?

38:31.540 --> 38:34.634
Mr. Bitcoin is
through that door.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.102
Mm-hmm.
Bao Shuwei.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.869
An econophysicist.
Yeah?

38:37.910 --> 38:39.502
From Nankai University.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.040
What's an
econophySICIst?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.344
Uh, I have no idea,

38:43.380 --> 38:45.484
but they're very impressed
with themselves.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.714
Is-is it all right
if a, uh...

38:46.750 --> 38:48.559
Treasury official
accompanies us?

38:48.590 --> 38:49.989
Sure.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.829
I have a key.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.828
Very resourceful of you.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.555
Great.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.749
(beeping)

39:07.610 --> 39:08.599
Looks like your friend
checked out.

39:13.650 --> 39:14.844
It's for you. Do you mind?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.745
Sure.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.813
"Dear Kalinda,
I wish I could stay and talk,

39:20.850 --> 39:23.159
"but I don't like attention,
and creating Bitcoin

39:23.190 --> 39:25.579
"would probably bring me
the wrong kind.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.586
"But now I have a new obsession.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.120
I love you."

39:40.870 --> 39:42.098
I have one more witness,
Your Honor.

39:42.140 --> 39:44.677
Goody, goody.
I can't wait, Mrs. Florrick.

39:44.710 --> 39:45.802
Kalinda Sharma.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.616
ALICIA:
And Mr. Higgs followed you

39:50.650 --> 39:52.140
into the hotel room?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.658
Yes.
And he stated
that he was looking

39:54.690 --> 39:55.679
for the real inventor
of Bitcoin?

39:55.720 --> 39:57.119
Objection, Your Honor.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.957
No, Mr. Higgs.
You may answer.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.595
Mr. Higgs stated
that he believed

40:01.630 --> 40:03.825
I was on the right track
to finding Mr. Bitcoin.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.997
And what was that right track?

40:05.030 --> 40:06.520
Bao Shuwei,

40:06.570 --> 40:08.629
an econophysicist
from Nankai University.

40:08.670 --> 40:10.467
Objection. This is all
hearsay, Your Honor.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.808
KALINDA:
No. No.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.637
Uh, I recorded it.

40:13.670 --> 40:14.705
By accident.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.071
I just got a new phone,

40:16.110 --> 40:18.476
and I didn't know
how to turn it off.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.711
Thank you.

40:25.750 --> 40:26.819
Feeling less terrified?

40:26.850 --> 40:28.681
Oh, much less.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.779
Here's your
cashier's check.

40:30.820 --> 40:34.153
It only took 20 minutes
standing in line at a bank

40:34.190 --> 40:37.057
to change dollar bills
into another piece of paper.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.727
Thank you.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.762
I went online, and I bought
one Bitcoin last night.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.097
Really?

40:43.140 --> 40:44.732
It's the future.

40:44.770 --> 40:45.737
I don't know.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.067
It didn't feel real.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.533
Well, real's going to change.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.878
Just watch.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.685
Thank you.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.914
For what?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.257
Testifying.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.087
I just followed
the path you set.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.121
The path I set?
Yeah.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.663
There is no Mr. Bitcoin.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.759
There's three.
(elevator bell dings)

41:16.740 --> 41:18.560
Really?
Yeah.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.828
It's not one person;
it's three.

41:20.870 --> 41:25.273
I looked up the Decode-a-Con
logs for the last three years.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.107
You met each other in 2009,

41:27.150 --> 41:29.141
and that's where you came up
with the idea.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.670
(elevator doors close)

41:30.720 --> 41:32.688
Elaine wrote
the manifesto,

41:32.720 --> 41:35.086
and Bao wrote the code.

41:37.260 --> 41:40.684
And you got all that from...
what, a log?

41:40.730 --> 41:44.860
Oh, from a log and a lot
of pointed fingers.

41:44.900 --> 41:48.631
You were hoping to lose
the Treasury in a round-robin.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.170
I think you are overestimating
my intelligence.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.030
No.
(elevator bell dings)

41:57.080 --> 41:58.945
I don't think I am.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.141
(elevator doors opening)

42:01.180 --> 42:04.581
Well, then, thank you.

42:04.620 --> 42:06.815
I'm honored.

42:17.100 --> 42:21.799
* Mystic palm, gem and tarot

42:21.840 --> 42:23.660
Hey.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.860
There you are.

42:24.910 --> 42:27.003
* A few escape
your magic arrow *

42:27.040 --> 42:29.235
What do you have?

42:30.810 --> 42:34.814
* I saw you reel them in
for miles *

42:36.850 --> 42:41.287
* Each captivated
crooked smile *

42:41.320 --> 42:42.981
What's this?

42:43.020 --> 42:44.749
You'll see.

42:44.790 --> 42:48.829
* And you know you
can heal them all *

42:48.860 --> 42:50.054
Thank you.

42:50.100 --> 42:53.092
* And even in
your ghastly Vi5ions... *
