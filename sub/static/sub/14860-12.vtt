WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:02.867
Ding!

00:03.170 --> 00:04.877
Mmm.
(MAKES CHOMPING SOUNDS)

00:05.172 --> 00:06.253
Ding.
What are we?

00:06.548 --> 00:08.539
A typewriter.
Unsanitary.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.752
Brad is correct.
Jane is a bitch.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.463
YES! (LAUGHS)
Mmm.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.968
I'm always right
about Cornplay.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.253
Was wrong about Coldplay,
though. They're still huge.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.172
Mmm.
Yes, they are.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.591
Speaking of things we never
thought would last, look at you two.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.680
Still going strong.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.097
Yeah, best of all, we've got the
original foursome back together.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.639
Roll call!
Onh!

00:25.943 --> 00:27.684
Brad. Jane. Dave. Alex.
JANE: Mmm.

00:27.986 --> 00:28.976
We must protect
this house!

00:29.279 --> 00:30.064
(WHOOPS)
JANE: Yeah!

00:30.364 --> 00:32.025
And, Max!
BRAD: Yeah.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.860
Hello?
This is not a foursome.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.695
You guys are totally
fifth-wheeling me.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.452
Come on, man. We're not
fifth-wheeling you, Joey Fatone.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.237
Yeah, you're still part
of the group, Sporty Spice.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.077
You're our favorite character,
Roz from "Frasier."

00:42.376 --> 00:44.538
Watch it. Oh, Roz.
She was the Rozziest.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.248
Whatever. I don't need
the four of you anyway,

00:47.548 --> 00:49.004
because here comes Penny,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.381
and she no doubt
has a tall tale to tell

00:51.677 --> 00:54.044
about how she ruined her
10-day-old relationship with Pete.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.178
| live for these stories.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.680
Hey, guys. MAX: Hey.
Pen. Let me guess.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.887
Pete broke up with you because
he was shaving at your house

01:01.186 --> 01:03.894
and caught you whipping
the whiskers into a little vial

01:04.188 --> 01:05.474
that you would thus
wear around your neck

01:05.774 --> 01:06.935
so you would always have
a piece of him on you.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.395
No.

01:08.694 --> 01:09.684
Max, that is rude.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.022
| am sure that
he broke up with her

01:11.321 --> 01:12.527
because she showed him
a video of her birth

01:12.823 --> 01:14.234
because she thought it would
"bring 'em closer"?

01:14.533 --> 01:15.773
BRAD: I know.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.157
She came up with
a nickname for his junk,

01:17.452 --> 01:18.908
"then got confused and
called it "dad."” Could be.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.571
No. You guys! S.T.D.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.580
| was gonna guess that!
You to him or him to you?

01:23.875 --> 01:26.287
No, S.T.D...
Sorry to disappoint,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.123
also, still together,
dummies.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.004
Double S.T.D.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.916
That's right, friends, Pete
and I are a-doing a-great.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.299
Oh, yeah.
Well, where is this Pete?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.175
He's parking the car.
Yeah?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.006
The getaway car?

01:37.306 --> 01:38.387
He's about to come in here and
break up with you right in front of us?

01:38.682 --> 01:39.763
Hey, everyone.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.048
Ah, do it, Pete.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.557
Missed you, babe.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.515
Aw!
Okay, scooch, guys.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.226
BRAD: Man on end. There's
a man coming through.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.765
(ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)

01:50.068 --> 01:51.229
Uh!

01:51.528 --> 01:52.609
(THUD)
ALL: Oh!

01:52.904 --> 01:54.360
ALEX: Seriously?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.272
PENNY: Idiot.
Max, you're the Rozziest.

01:56.575 --> 01:57.610
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:10.339 --> 02:12.751
JANE: So we are all set
for Dad's party.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.711
Traditional Serbian
restaurant...check.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.126
Traditional Serbian menu...
a-check.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.294
Traditional Serbian music...

02:18.597 --> 02:22.010
Czech... Oslovakian.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.891
It is tough to find
a Serbian band.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.927
By the way, Jane,
| took care of the apps.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.765
We're gonna have
head cheese dumplings

02:28.065 --> 02:29.100
with blood sausage
dipping sauce.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.855
(GAGS)

02:31.151 --> 02:33.267
Okay, now I just
have to figure out

02:33.570 --> 02:34.605
what I'm gonna say
in my toast to Dad.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.066
Just say something
nice and heartfelt.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.400
You're good at that.
Boring.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.158
This year, I'm a-gonna
do some a-comedy.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.161
That's a a-terrible a-idea.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.367
Yeah, especially for Dad.
He doesn't laugh at anything.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.577
| mean,
except for Gallagher.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.957
But who doesn't find
Gallagher hilarious?

02:49.252 --> 02:50.492
| don't.
(LAUGHS)

02:50.796 --> 02:53.379
With the watermelons
and the smashing?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.711
It's funny because
it's wasteful.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.545
It's just not funny. Well, I
am gonna make him laugh

02:57.844 --> 02:59.334
by constructing
the perfect joke

02:59.638 --> 03:00.378
appealing to his
specific interests,

03:00.681 --> 03:01.591
crafted by his
loving daughter,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.346
who's done
exhaustive research.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.303
Comedy's all about
research, babe.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.388
It's why Dave Chappelle has
two LexisNexis accounts.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.053
You'll see.
| don't know.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.391
| mean, your dad's
kind of a tough room.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.398
So... Parties, right?

03:15.070 --> 03:16.151
Why would you say that?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.483
Well, at least this year
I've got Dave.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.648
Actually, I told Dave
that he didn't have to go.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.237
What? | know, but
these family events

03:22.536 --> 03:24.197
are so long and boring.
Got that right.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.907
Plus Dave's steak truck

03:26.206 --> 03:28.072
just got hired for a
quinceanera. Mmm.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.493
Yeah. 15-year-old
Mexican girls love Dave.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.752
They call him
vaquero blanca de fuego.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.378
Que?
The fiery white cowgirl.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.542
He is not fiery.
No.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.836
So you're really not going
to Mr. Ks party?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.129
Yeah. Alex said
she was cool with it.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.673
Oh, Dave,
you scruffy dummy.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.558
I'm glad you came to me.
You came here.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.685
Going to family events
IS a major part

03:49.980 --> 03:51.345
of being
in a serious relationship.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.264
You have to be there.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.275
This is the 20th anniversary
of a man's mattress store.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.777
It's two decades of pillow
tops and memory foam.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.437
Memory foam, Dave...

04:00.741 --> 04:03.028
It doesn't forget,
and neither will Alex.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.566
So even though Alex said
| don't have to go,

04:04.870 --> 04:05.735
she really wants me there.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.449
And bingo was his name-o.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.239
David, I have been
in a thriving relaysh

04:10.542 --> 04:11.498
for... I can't even
remember how long.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.783
10 days.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.576
11 nights.
You have to trust me.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.120
| don't want to
overstate it, but I think

04:16.423 --> 04:18.584
I've sort of mastered
relationships completely,

04:18.884 --> 04:20.545
like forever,
into perpa-tutu.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.209
Well, I do think
you want to overstate it,

04:22.512 --> 04:23.673
but I'm happy that
you and Pete are happy.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.215
It is going so great!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.178
| haven't even made that list of
faults that I make for every guy

04:29.478 --> 04:30.809
so that if we break up,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.436
| can console myself with
his many weaknesses and such.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.314
You do that?
Oh, yeah.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.144
Name any guy
I've ever dated.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.267
Simon.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.811
Micro junk, played the
recorder, addicted to angel dust.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.029
Oh. Now I feel better.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.565
Simon was addicted
to angel dust?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.693
That's why he was
always punching cars.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.987
| just thought he was cool.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.578
Max, you are gonna help me
build the perfect joke for my dad,

04:53.877 --> 04:56.244
you are my less fit,
less handsome Bruce Vilanch.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.207
Ooh. Low blow.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.623
Okay, these are
my Dad's chief interests.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.508
Pay attention.

Neither. Talk show host.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.812
My dad was a big fan
of "The Chevy Chase Show."

05:15.106 --> 05:16.688
He always bet on the wrong
horse when it came to late night...

05:16.983 --> 05:19.270
Rivers, Thicke, Johnson.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.684
Loved "The Magic Hour."

05:20.987 --> 05:22.603
Magic's a national hero.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.988
He really raised awareness
about how a person

05:25.283 --> 05:27.149
could successfully live
with not having a talk show.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.443
Mmm.
Next interest.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.953
No, that's it. I mean, except
for old-timey slide projectors.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.747
It's freaking me out.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.283

hit on all of these areas.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.075

from Nazis.

"Saturday Nacht Live" place?

the middle of the road.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.466
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.760
I'm a little
off my game, okay?

05:55.063 --> 05:55.598
It's just... Penny's been
hanging out so much with Pete.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.683
| really miss her.
Mmm.

05:57.983 --> 06:01.021
| mean, her crazy
train-wreck break-up stories

06:01.319 --> 06:02.980
that make me feel SO
much better about my life.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.441
Max, Penny's happy,

06:04.739 --> 06:05.695
so as her friend,
you should be...

06:05.991 --> 06:07.152
probably be trying
to break her and Pete up.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.531
Yeah, I just don't know
if that seems like me,

06:10.161 --> 06:11.617
but I do like
your other idea.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.496
What other idea? Find someone
who's as big a mess as Penny,

06:14.791 --> 06:16.452
start hanging out with her
to make Penny jealous,

06:16.751 --> 06:19.083

crawling back to me.

credit, girl. You are that good.

Look at your plate.

What are you eating?

Salad?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.613
What did I teach you
about buffet strategy?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.741
Always start with
your high-end meats.

fill you up with nonsense.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.269
No. Just don't...

08:04.567 --> 08:06.183
I Stay with me J

08:08.488 --> 08:09.603
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

08:09.906 --> 08:10.816
Skinny margarita,
please.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.528
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:13.827 --> 08:14.692
(CONTINUES CLEARING THROAT)

08:16.663 --> 08:17.403
So...

08:19.207 --> 08:20.163
Parties, right?
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

08:22.919 --> 08:24.751
Really?
You're still on that?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.623
Um...

08:30.093 --> 08:30.878
Wanna hear a joke?

08:32.761 --> 08:33.592
Try me.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.004
Open.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.758
Now there's a little
pocket of meat in there.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.015
Now bite down on it.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.510
And...
Mmm!

08:42.813 --> 08:44.555
Uh-huh. What do you taste?
(MOUTH FULL) More meat.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.440
(LAUGHS) Now you're
getting the hang of it.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.850
Mmm!
DAVE: Hey, everybody.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.643
Surprise!
Dave.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.529
Alex. Mrs. K.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.440
Oh.
You look beautiful tonight.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.029
Oh, Dave, what are you doing
here? What are you doing here?

08:56.327 --> 08:57.488
Well, Al, | know you
said | didn't have to come,

08:57.787 --> 08:59.403
but I thought about it,
and I should be here.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.537
We're getting
serious again.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.414
Serious?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.497
(LAUGHS) Yeah. He means like
how we're all getting serious again,

09:05.795 --> 09:07.957
you know, 'cause of all
the wars and the flash mobs

09:08.256 --> 09:09.587
and that floating
garbage island.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.716
Okay, we are
post-Katrina, guys.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.752
In conclusion, let me walk
you out, my solemn chum.

09:15.055 --> 09:15.635
Let's go.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.138
What was that
all about?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.391
Well...

09:21.686 --> 09:23.017
| may not have told my
parents that we're back together.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.394
What? Maybe I did.
No, I definitely didn't.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.641
BRAD: So Mike Ditka rolls
up on his Sherman tank, right?

09:29.944 --> 09:31.480
And then Ditka says,

09:31.780 --> 09:33.566
"Next slide, please.”

09:37.660 --> 09:38.991
(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

09:41.790 --> 09:42.700
(LAUGHS)

09:44.501 --> 09:45.457
Boom!

09:45.752 --> 09:46.708
(LAUGHING)

09:50.799 --> 09:52.255
No boom?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.711
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

09:58.681 --> 10:00.843
That was hilarious!

10:01.142 --> 10:02.883
Usually, I'm not much
of a joke joke guy.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.551
| like physical comedy...
something where

10:04.854 --> 10:06.344
a big piece of fruit
makes the ultimate sacrifice.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.433
You know what I'm
talking about? Yes.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.814
But I am seeing you now
in a whole new light, Brad.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.726
Well, I hope it's a light from
Ditka's old-timey slide projector.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.393
Uh! (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

10:15.281 --> 10:16.271
It's great joke.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.316
It was masterfully crafted.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.610
Look, I'm sorry. You left me
alone with him, and I panicked.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.950
I'm seeing you
in a whole new light, too...

10:24.249 --> 10:26.365
the kind of light they use
when you try on a bathing suit,

10:26.668 --> 10:29.126
which is a very
unflattering light, sir.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.000
Not good!

10:32.549 --> 10:34.586
How could you not have told your
parents that we're back together?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.466
It's not the easiest
conversation to have.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.001
| mean, my father
just now forgave me

10:38.304 --> 10:39.419
for the whole
wedding fiasco.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.134
| mean, that was a hugely
embarrassing event for our whole family.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.798
Really?
Yeah.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.184
'Cause my family thought
it was a rocking good time.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.641
Look, if I can get over this,
so can your folks.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.106
All right,
let's tell them right now.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.187
I'll do it. Come on.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.601
Okay. Yeah. You're
right. Let's do it. Okay.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.112
Dave Rose
and my daughter Alex.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.773
Hey.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.362
You know, when I see
you two nitwits,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.117
I'm reminded
of that fateful day

11:03.413 --> 11:04.528
when you didn't get married,
and I spent tons of money.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.037
Remember that day?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.824
You didn't get married.
| spent tons of money.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.117
You didn't spend
tons of money. I did.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.662
You know, I won't be
able to retire on time.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.840
Anyway, great to see you.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.043
(STRAINED VOICE) Uh...

11:20.346 --> 11:20.801
(CLENCHED TEETH) Not
as easy as you thought, huh?

11:22.432 --> 11:23.763
MAX: Hey, you.

11:24.058 --> 11:24.923
This is my new Penny.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.591
Uh, friend. Sorry.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.353
Penny, this is Nickel.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.137
It's pronounced Nicole.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.727
A nickel's worth five
times as much as Penny.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.232
(LAUGHS)

11:34.527 --> 11:35.733
This trick got some crazy
stories. Tell her, Nickel.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.110
Well, I was
dating this guy

11:37.405 --> 11:38.987
from my overdaters
anonymous group.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.444
His name is Kevin. Crap. I'm
not supposed to say his name.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.825
It's Kevin Murphy.
Why am I telling you that?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.737
His mother's maiden name
is Andleman. Can't stop!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.781
(CHUCKLES) Then don't.
Anyway, I go to the trouble

11:49.083 --> 11:50.699
to create a Yelp page
about myself,

11:51.002 --> 11:52.913
and he doesn't
even review me. No.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.956
But his mother does,
and her review is scathing.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.794
(UNDER BREATH) Unh-unh.
Pronounce it like I taught you.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.583
(SINGSONG) Scah-thing!
Ooh. Nice.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.093
Oh, Max.
Oh, Penny.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.219
| know what you're doing.
Oh, do you?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.720
Because I'm finally in, like,

12:05.016 --> 12:07.178
a really healthy relationship
with a great guy...

12:07.477 --> 12:09.559
Mmm-hmm. And it's
just making you feel

12:09.854 --> 12:11.970
like I'm the perfect
relationship guru,

12:12.273 --> 12:13.388
and you want me
to help your friend.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.682
| will do it. Nicole, yay.
Let's talk.

12:15.985 --> 12:16.975
Come here, baby girl.
Unh-unh-unh, baby girl.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.110
We BFF's. What kind of
lady tamps you usin'?

12:19.405 --> 12:20.065
Uh... Okay, Nicole,
do you mind if I ask you

12:20.365 --> 12:21.947
what sign you are?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.824
Taurus. Okay. You're gonna
need a really stable man,

12:24.118 --> 12:25.574
like someone
who deserves you.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.702
(GASPS) Oh, my gosh!
You need someone like Jimmy.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.908
Jimmy is Pete's brother,
and he is almost

12:30.208 --> 12:31.243
as awesome as Pete.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.533
Almost.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.998
Nah, he's better. He's
Jimmy. PENNY: Aw!

12:36.297 --> 12:37.128
Are we in the
same spin class?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.005
Oh. Yeah.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.711
Spin class
or chemistry class?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.842
It's like "Breaking Bad" in
here. Sit down. Let's cook.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.219
My plan is failing.
Max, please scooch.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.131
Scooch, scooch, scooch.
Ah.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.470
Ah. There we go.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.099
| could do this all day.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.268
Hmm... Hmm.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.974
(THUD)

12:54.274 --> 12:55.435
The deejay wouldn't
give us our money back...

12:55.733 --> 12:57.269
only a credit
on a future event.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.729
Thank God for us,
your grandma died.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.564
Now her favorite song
was "Brick House,"

13:00.863 --> 13:02.729
so it all worked out.
(CHUCKLES)

13:03.032 --> 13:04.989
Look, Dave, isn't there
something that you'd like to say

13:05.285 --> 13:06.616
about people
and their situation?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.198
Yes. Mmm.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.704
Yes. Alex and I are...

13:12.000 --> 13:14.537
Look, I'm sorry. | know I've
been beating up on you guys,

13:14.836 --> 13:17.043
but, Dave,
| always really liked you.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.453
Actually, I have a lot of
respect for you. Really?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.042
Yeah.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.797
It takes a big man
to stay friends

13:22.093 --> 13:24.050
with a woman who
humiliated him like that.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.380
Well, I don't think
"humiliated" is the right word.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.136
Emasculated.
That's good.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.014
Oh, uh, embarrassed.
Uh-huh.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.595
Uh, castrated.
Ooh.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.258
Could the word "eunuch”
be a verb?

13:32.562 --> 13:34.473
No.
It's a place, Mom.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.388
Oh. I'm sorry.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.934
Well, Dave,
what's new with you?

13:40.236 --> 13:40.816
| mean, have you
been dating anyone?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.360
Dating? Yes.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.609
Lots.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.774
Yards and yards of ladies.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.661
In fact, meters, even,
'cause of the Canadians.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.493
(IMITATES CANADIAN ACCENT) Yeah,
I'm all aboot that Canadian strange, eh?

13:56.461 --> 13:57.121
Gotta go.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.791
| think Jimmy
really liked Nicole.

14:04.093 --> 14:04.878
PENNY: Oh, what can I say?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.668
| have the hot hand.

14:06.971 --> 14:07.836
(LAUGHS)

14:08.139 --> 14:09.220
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

14:09.515 --> 14:11.256
Hello.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.891
(IMITATES OPRAH WINFREY)
How do you do it, Penny Hartz?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.475
Where does it come from,
this uncanny knack

14:17.774 --> 14:19.310
for giving lovers
their road maps to happiness?

14:20.902 --> 14:22.142
(NORMAL VOICE)
| don't know.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.981
| think it comes from always
making the right moves

14:24.280 --> 14:25.941
in my own relationship.
But you tell me.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.071
You're the expert. (LAUGHS)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.732
Penny, what is this?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.241
A list of "Pete's faults"?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.322
Oh. That.

14:32.622 --> 14:36.581
That list in particular...
That's about Pete Rose.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.116
He...he bet on baseball.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.329
He's a bad man.
Let me just...

14:39.629 --> 14:41.586
"Nipples a quarter inch
too low,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.872
"too much of a gentleman
in the boudoir,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.132
"repeated mispronunciation
of kwy-noa?"

14:47.595 --> 14:48.551
It's quinoa.

14:49.931 --> 14:50.841
You made a list
of my flaws?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.381
No. Yes.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.845
It's this thing that I do.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.350
| think I gotta go.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.679
Wait.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.938
No!

15:01.234 --> 15:02.941
Pete! I'm pregnant!

15:03.236 --> 15:04.317
I'm not!
But I could be!

15:04.612 --> 15:05.647
We could sell it
and live off the money!

15:12.578 --> 15:13.568
There he is.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.741
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:16.040 --> 15:16.905
Why the long face,
Michael Phelps?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.540
| don't know, man.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.951
| guess I didn't really think
about what it would mean

15:21.254 --> 15:22.289
to get back together
with Alex,

15:22.588 --> 15:24.329
and now, you know,
everyone in there

15:24.632 --> 15:26.373
is gonna want to
put in their 2 cents, and...

15:26.676 --> 15:28.087
Buddy, you don't think
Jane and |

15:28.386 --> 15:29.968
have to deal with that
every day?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.845
Especially with family.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.426
For years, my aunt
Margaret's nickname for Jane

15:33.724 --> 15:35.089
has been "cocaine."”
What?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.475
Yeah. Skinny, white,

15:37.770 --> 15:39.306
and a scourge
to the black community.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.187
That's a special
kind of racism. Yeah.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.392
You know what?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.478
Jane and I get through it.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.312
We don't care
what people think.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.278
You're right.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.984
Wait. Aren't you stealing
your wife's jokes

15:50.283 --> 15:51.318
because you do care
what Mr. K thinks?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.281
Do as I say, bruh,
not as I duh.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.499
(LAUGHS)

16:03.379 --> 16:04.710
You made the list?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.212
Of course
| made the fault list.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.168
I'm me,
and that is not all.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.550
Oh, thank God
that's not all. Hit me.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.882
So after Pete left, |
followed him down the street

16:13.181 --> 16:14.763
into the convenience store
where I hid in the magazine section.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.639
Uh-huh.
But then he saw me,

16:16.934 --> 16:17.969
so I tried to duck down...
Uh-huh.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.010
But my shirt got torn
by the salty snack rack!

16:20.313 --> 16:21.724
Uh-oh! And then
my boob popped out.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.184
Yes! Which one?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.188
The bad one. The right.

Keep going. Keep going.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.195
Okay, so then I tried to pull off
a magazine to cover my boob,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.197

But you shouldn't look
at me as a victim. No. No.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.224
You should only look at

while Alex and I were
broken up as victims...
