>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:39.139 --> 00:39.806
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:39.873 --> 00:40.940
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.142
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:42.208 --> 00:42.642
US.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.010
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:44.077 --> 00:44.644
THE WEEK, WHICH SAW WORLD

00:44.711 --> 00:45.311
LEADERS GATHER FOR THE U.N.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.479
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, MAJOR

00:46.546 --> 00:48.648
ELECTIONS IN GERMANY AND CANADA,

00:48.715 --> 00:50.817
AND "THE VIEW" THROWN INTO CHAOS

00:50.884 --> 00:52.185
AFTER TWO OF ITS HOSTS TESTED

00:52.252 --> 00:56.990
POSITIVE FOR COVID MID-SHOW,

00:57.056 --> 00:58.324
LEADING TO THIS INCREDIBLE

00:58.391 --> 00:58.558
MOMENT.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.492
>> I NEED THE TWO OF YOU TO STEP

00:59.559 --> 01:02.896
OFF FOR A SECOND.

01:02.962 --> 01:03.596
>> OKAY.

01:03.663 --> 01:04.798
>> ANA AND SUNNY HAVE TO LEAVE.

01:04.864 --> 01:05.432
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU

01:05.498 --> 01:05.865
BACK LATER.

01:05.932 --> 01:06.566
>> AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHY --

01:06.633 --> 01:08.635
>> MORE INFORMATION LATER --

01:08.701 --> 01:08.968
IT'S A TEASE.

01:09.035 --> 01:09.502
>> WE'LL TELL YOU WHY IN A

01:09.569 --> 01:11.037
COUPLE MINUTES.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.238
SO SHOULD I INTRODUCE THE

01:12.305 --> 01:12.605
VICE PRESIDENT?

01:12.672 --> 01:13.406
>> YES.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.041
>> OKAY, SO, VICE PRESIDENT.

01:15.108 --> 01:15.575
>> NO!

01:15.642 --> 01:16.743
>> NO?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.077
>> NO.

01:18.144 --> 01:18.311
>> OKAY.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.814
>> John: WOW.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.347
THAT DOES NOT LOOK GREAT.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.482
FILMING A TELEVISION SHOW IS

01:22.549 --> 01:23.016
BASICALLY LIKE RAISING A

01:23.082 --> 01:24.417
TODDLER: IT'S UNPREDICTABLE,

01:24.484 --> 01:25.785
OCCASIONALLY FRUSTRATING, AND IF

01:25.852 --> 01:27.287
YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF HAVING TO

01:27.353 --> 01:28.388
SCREAM "NO," SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO

01:28.455 --> 01:33.226
WALK INTO A DEADLY SITUATION.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.094
BUT THE WEEK'S BEEN DOMINATED BY

01:35.161 --> 01:36.062
THE EVENTS IN DEL RIO, TEXAS,

01:36.129 --> 01:37.297
WHERE THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS --

01:37.363 --> 01:38.198
MOSTLY HAITIANS -- ATTEMPTING TO

01:38.264 --> 01:38.898
CROSS THE BORDER WERE MET WITH

01:38.965 --> 01:39.732
THIS RESPONSE.

01:39.799 --> 01:40.567
>> IMAGES SURFACE OF

01:40.633 --> 01:42.869
BORDER PATROL AGENTS ON

01:42.936 --> 01:45.772
HORSEBACK APPEARING TO USE THEIR

01:45.839 --> 01:51.911
HORSE'S REINS LIKE WHIPS TO

01:51.978 --> 01:52.679
--

01:52.745 --> 01:53.413
AS ONE GROUP TRIED TO PASS, AN

01:53.480 --> 01:54.180
AGENT SAID THIS.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.315
>> HEY, YOU USE YOUR WOMEN?

01:55.381 --> 01:56.049
THIS IS WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS

01:56.115 --> 01:56.649
SHIT!

01:56.716 --> 01:57.116
>> John: REALLY?

01:57.183 --> 01:58.251
YOU'RE GONNA CALL "THEIR"

01:58.318 --> 01:58.685
COUNTRY SHIT?

01:58.751 --> 01:59.319
BECAUSE THEY JUST GOT HERE, AND

01:59.385 --> 02:00.253
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A GREAT CASE

02:00.320 --> 02:00.987
FOR THIS ONE.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.555
SO FAR, 100% OF THEIR EXPERIENCE

02:02.622 --> 02:04.624
IN AMERICA HAS INVOLVED A

02:04.691 --> 02:05.425
BELLIGERENT MAN DRESSED AS A

02:05.492 --> 02:06.359
PARTY CITY PARK RANGER SCREAMING

02:06.426 --> 02:15.401
AT THEM ON HORSEBACK.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.236
AND WHEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO

02:16.302 --> 02:17.136
THOSE IMAGES, THE BIDEN

02:17.203 --> 02:18.004
ADMINISTRATION FELL BACK ON ONE

02:18.071 --> 02:18.505
OF THEIR GREATEST HITS.

02:18.571 --> 02:19.105
>> WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY?

02:19.172 --> 02:19.672
HOW DID HE FEEL WHEN HE SAW

02:19.739 --> 02:20.106
THEM?

02:20.173 --> 02:20.974
>> HE ALSO FELT THEY WERE

02:21.040 --> 02:21.474
HORRIFIC AND HORRIBLE.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.742
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD

02:22.809 --> 02:24.677
WATCH THAT VIDEO AND NOT HAVE

02:24.744 --> 02:25.011
THAT EMOTION.

02:25.078 --> 02:25.545
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:25.612 --> 02:26.179
PEOPLE TO KNOW, THIS IS NOT WHO

02:26.246 --> 02:27.280
WE ARE.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.515
THAT'S NOT WHO THE BIDEN-HARRIS

02:28.581 --> 02:29.983
ADMINISTRATION IS.

02:30.049 --> 02:33.219
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.654
'CAUSE SAYING "THIS IS NOT WHO

02:34.721 --> 02:36.189
WE ARE" ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE

02:36.256 --> 02:37.757
CHASING BLACK PEOPLE ON HORSES

02:37.824 --> 02:38.958
IS A BIT OF A STRETCH.

02:39.025 --> 02:39.492
HISTORICALLY, WE'VE BEEN

02:39.559 --> 02:40.760
YES-AND-ING THAT IDEA SINCE

02:40.827 --> 02:42.228
1619.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.329
IF YOU LISTED THE TOP THREE

02:43.396 --> 02:44.597
THINGS THAT MAKE AMERICA

02:44.664 --> 02:45.899
AMERICA, IT'D BE REGIONAL

02:45.965 --> 02:48.368
SANDWICH DIFFERENCES, FLYOVERS

02:48.434 --> 02:49.135
AT HALFTIME, AND WHITE PEOPLE

02:49.202 --> 02:50.770
CHASING BLACK PEOPLE WHILE ON

02:50.837 --> 02:54.440
HORSEBACK.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.542
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT MADE

02:55.608 --> 02:55.875
AMERICA GREAT.

02:55.942 --> 02:56.976
JUST WHAT MADE AMERICA AMERICA.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.077
AS FOR "THIS IS NOT WHO

02:58.144 --> 02:59.445
THE BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION

02:59.512 --> 03:00.046
IS" -- ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE

03:00.113 --> 03:01.314
ABOUT THAT?

03:01.381 --> 03:03.550
'CAUSE FROM AN IMMIGRATION

03:03.616 --> 03:04.250
STANDPOINT, THERE'S NOT A TON OF

03:04.317 --> 03:04.951
EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE ANYTHING

03:05.018 --> 03:09.856
ELSE YET.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.090
THIS ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD ON

03:11.157 --> 03:11.791
IMMIGRATION, PARTICULARLY ON THE

03:11.858 --> 03:12.458
SOUTHERN BORDER, HAS BEEN DEEPLY

03:12.525 --> 03:12.859
UNDERWHELMING.

03:12.926 --> 03:13.560
AND THIS WEEK, THEY'VE BEEN ALL

03:13.626 --> 03:19.232
OVER THE MAP.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.333
'CAUSE WHILE MANY HAITIANS WERE

03:20.400 --> 03:21.067
RELEASED INTO THE U.S., WE ALSO

03:21.134 --> 03:21.701
SENT THOUSANDS BACK TO A NATION

03:21.768 --> 03:22.435
THAT'S RECENTLY SUFFERED AN

03:22.502 --> 03:23.269
EARTHQUAKE AND A PRESIDENTIAL

03:23.336 --> 03:24.203
ASSASSINATION WITH NO CLEAR

03:24.270 --> 03:24.871
RATIONALE FOR HOW THOSE

03:24.938 --> 03:30.143
DECISIONS WERE MADE.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.678
AND IT'S NOT GREAT WHEN OUR

03:31.744 --> 03:32.278
PROCESS FOR DECIDING WHO GETS

03:32.345 --> 03:32.879
RELEASED AND WHO GETS EXPELLED

03:32.946 --> 03:33.513
IS AS HAPHAZARD AS THE PROCESS

03:33.580 --> 03:35.982
FOR FINDING THE NEW HOST OF

03:36.049 --> 03:42.956
"JEOPARDY!"

03:43.022 --> 03:44.958
AND BY THE WAY, GREAT JOB SO

03:45.024 --> 03:45.224
FAR, GUYS.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.125
YOU DODGED GIVING THAT DUDE THE

03:46.192 --> 03:46.726
JOB PERMANENTLY, AND RIGHT NOW

03:46.793 --> 03:47.293
WE'VE GOT SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY

03:47.360 --> 03:47.727
FREE OF CONTROVERSY,

03:47.794 --> 03:48.628
MAYIM BIALIK, A PERSON I THINK

03:48.695 --> 03:49.228
IS GREAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

03:49.295 --> 03:51.497
GOOGLE.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.999
AND THE REASON WE'VE BEEN ABLE

03:53.066 --> 03:53.900
TO EXPEL OVER 2,000 HAITIANS SO

03:53.967 --> 03:54.968
QUICKLY IS THE BIDEN

03:55.034 --> 03:56.603
ADMINISTRATION IS USING ONE OF

03:56.669 --> 03:58.071
TRUMP'S MOST INFAMOUS

03:58.137 --> 04:00.239
IMMIGRATION POLICIES, TITLE 42,

04:00.306 --> 04:02.976
A BULLSHIT MOVE THAT LETS YOU

04:03.042 --> 04:03.576
TURN AWAY ASYLUM SEEKERS UNDER

04:03.643 --> 04:05.878
THE GUISE OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.313
IT IS SUCH BULLSHIT, A FEDERAL

04:07.380 --> 04:08.881
JUDGE IN WASHINGTON SAID ITS USE

04:08.948 --> 04:11.150
IN THIS MANNER IS LIKELY

04:11.217 --> 04:12.185
ILLEGAL.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.953
SO IT IS NO WONDER THE SPECIAL

04:14.020 --> 04:16.589
ENVOY FOR HAITI, DANIEL FOOTE,

04:16.656 --> 04:17.223
RESIGNED THIS WEEK, REFUSING TO

04:17.290 --> 04:18.291
BE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT THE

04:18.358 --> 04:19.125
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS DOING.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.827
AND IT IS HARD TO BLAME HIM WHEN

04:20.893 --> 04:21.494
YOU CONSIDER WHAT SOME OF THESE

04:21.561 --> 04:22.762
PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH --

04:22.829 --> 04:23.663
NOT JUST IN ORDER TO GET HERE,

04:23.730 --> 04:24.764
BUT IN THE PROCESS OF BEING

04:24.831 --> 04:26.499
EXPELLED.

04:26.566 --> 04:27.467
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MAN, WHO WAS

04:27.533 --> 04:28.901
PUT ON A PLANE BACK TO HAITI,

04:28.968 --> 04:32.171
DESCRIBING HOW HE WAS TREATED.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.374
>> THEY CHAINED US LIKE ANIMALS.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.074
THEY CHAINED OUR HANDS, FEET,

04:35.141 --> 04:36.843
AND WAIST.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.177
ONCE WE ARRIVED, THEY MADE US

04:38.244 --> 04:39.312
STAY INSIDE THE PLANE UNTIL THEY

04:39.379 --> 04:40.046
UNCHAINED US SO THE JOURNALISTS

04:40.113 --> 04:43.316
WOULDN'T SEE WHAT THEY DID.

04:43.383 --> 04:49.288
>> John: THAT IS DESPICABLE.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.823
AND JUST AS AN ASIDE, I WOULD

04:50.890 --> 04:52.558
LOVE TO KNOW WHO MADE THE PR

04:52.625 --> 04:53.926
JUDGMENT THAT SHOWING HAITIANS

04:53.993 --> 04:55.395
IN CHAINS WAS UNACCEPTABLE BUT

04:55.461 --> 04:56.295
CHARGING THEM ON HORSEBACK WAS

04:56.362 --> 04:58.297
A-OK.

04:58.364 --> 04:58.998
'CAUSE THAT PERSON CLEARLY

04:59.065 --> 05:00.199
KNOWSTHEY'RE GOING TO HELL, BUT

05:00.266 --> 05:00.833
I'M NOT SURE THEY GRASP JUST HOW

05:00.900 --> 05:02.502
DEEP.

05:02.568 --> 05:03.369
IT FEELS THAT THE BIDEN

05:03.436 --> 05:05.138
ADMINISTRATION IS FAR MORE

05:05.204 --> 05:07.373
FOCUSED ON "SEEMING" BETTER WHEN

05:07.440 --> 05:08.474
IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION THAN

05:08.541 --> 05:08.975
ACTUALLY "BEING" BETTER.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.443
SOMETHING DRIVEN FURTHER HOME

05:10.510 --> 05:13.279
WHEN, JUST DAYS AFTER HER "THIS

05:13.346 --> 05:13.846
IS NOT WHO WE ARE" COMMENT,

05:13.913 --> 05:15.148
JEN PSAKI ONCE AGAIN SAID THE

05:15.214 --> 05:18.251
IMAGES FROM DEL RIO WERE DEEPLY

05:18.317 --> 05:18.851
TROUBLING TO THE PRESIDENT AND

05:18.918 --> 05:21.421
UNVEILED THIS BIG POLICY MOVE.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.289
>> THE SECRETARY ALSO CONVEYED

05:23.356 --> 05:24.490
TO CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS EARLIER

05:24.557 --> 05:25.491
THIS MORNING THAT WE WOULD NO

05:25.558 --> 05:26.592
LONGER BE USING HORSES IN

05:26.659 --> 05:28.027
DEL RIO.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.962
SO THAT IS SOMETHING, A POLICY

05:30.029 --> 05:30.530
CHANGE THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN

05:30.596 --> 05:31.364
RESPONSE.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.566
>> John: HOLD ON.

05:33.633 --> 05:34.834
ARE YOU IMPLYING IT WAS ALL THE

05:34.901 --> 05:37.437
HORSIES' FAULT?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.838
BECAUSE, IF I MAY QUOTE MYSELF

05:38.905 --> 05:40.606
AFTER WATCHING BURBERRY'S RECENT

05:40.673 --> 05:42.642
AD: IF YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON

05:42.709 --> 05:44.644
THE HORSES, YOU'RE MISSING A

05:44.711 --> 05:45.411
LOT.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.679
I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

05:46.746 --> 05:49.515
IT.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.717
I PROMISED HIM THAT THIS JOKE

05:50.783 --> 05:51.651
WAS FINISHED.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.518
BUT I CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND ASK

05:52.585 --> 05:53.252
YOU TO LOOK RIGHT IN MY EYES

05:53.319 --> 05:56.889
WHILE I DO THAT.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.292
LOOK, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

05:59.358 --> 06:00.426
PROMISED A BIG SHIFT WHEN IT

06:00.493 --> 06:01.427
COMES TO HOW WE TREAT MIGRANTS

06:01.494 --> 06:02.495
AT THE BORDER, BUT EIGHT MONTHS

06:02.562 --> 06:07.467
IN, WHERE IS IT?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.769
ALL OF THIS IS EMBLEMATIC OF A

06:09.836 --> 06:11.771
LARGER CONFUSION, WITH ONE

06:11.838 --> 06:12.305
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL EVEN

06:12.371 --> 06:12.672
SAYING, "I DON'T

06:12.739 --> 06:15.241
KNOW WHAT OUR IMMIGRATION

06:15.308 --> 06:17.643
STRATEGY IS AT ALL."

06:17.710 --> 06:18.911
BUT WE BADLY NEED ONE, AND SOON.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.012
BECAUSE WE'RE CURRENTLY SENDING

06:20.079 --> 06:20.646
VULNERABLE PEOPLE BACK INTO

06:20.713 --> 06:20.947
HARM'S WAY.

06:21.013 --> 06:21.981
AND IT'S PAST TIME FOR THIS

06:22.048 --> 06:24.050
ADMINISTRATION TO STOP SIMPLY

06:24.117 --> 06:25.384
TELLING PEOPLE WHO WE ARE, AND

06:25.451 --> 06:25.952
START FUCKING SHOWING THEM.

06:26.018 --> 06:31.390
AND NOW THIS.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.059
>> Announcer: AND NOW, LOCAL

06:33.126 --> 06:34.827
NEWS ANCHORS ANNOUNCE THE

06:34.894 --> 06:35.862
CHANGING OF THE SEASONS THE ONLY

06:35.928 --> 06:37.263
WAY THEY KNOW HOW.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.166
>> WELL, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY

06:40.233 --> 06:40.399
OF FALL.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.668
>> I'M SORRY, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU

06:42.735 --> 06:44.670
ARE USUALLY SET AT.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.606
>> IT'S FALL.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.976
>> IT IS FALL, Y'ALL.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.110
>> HAPPY FALL.

IS, THERE IS A SURPRISE AT THE

10:41.574 --> 10:42.908
OF COURSE NO ONE IS GOING TO

10:42.975 --> 10:44.877
FIND A BILL THAT LITERALLY SAYS

10:44.944 --> 10:45.678
"THIS SPECIFIC PERSON SHOULDN'T

10:45.745 --> 10:48.014
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE."

10:48.080 --> 10:48.614
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL KNOW THERE

10:48.681 --> 10:49.181
IS SOMEONE WHO SHOULDN'T BE

10:49.248 --> 10:49.815
ALLOWED TO VOTE, AND IT'S THIS

10:49.882 --> 10:50.182
GUY.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.350
HIS NAME IS BRANDON CARUSO.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.551
HIS FAVORITE PIZZA TOPPING IS

10:52.618 --> 10:53.219
"NO SAUCE," HIS FAVORITE SEASON

10:53.285 --> 10:54.653
OF "THE WIRE" IS "I HAVEN'T

10:54.720 --> 10:56.022
WATCHED IT YET," AND HIS LIST OF

10:56.088 --> 10:57.023
CELEBRITIES HE'D HAVE SEX WITH

10:57.089 --> 10:58.157
OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE IS,

10:58.224 --> 10:59.025
EXCLUSIVELY, FIVE TIMES,

10:59.091 --> 10:59.759
THE WHEEL FROM

10:59.825 --> 11:00.860
"WHEEL OF FORTUNE."

11:00.926 --> 11:02.328
NOT VANNA.

11:02.395 --> 11:02.561
NOT PAT.

11:02.628 --> 11:03.329
THE WHEEL.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.964
FIVE TIMES.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.265
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.701
BRANDON.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.536
BUT THE THING IS, IF YOU DO

11:10.603 --> 11:12.905
ACTUALLY READ THESE BILLS, YOU

11:12.972 --> 11:15.141
QUICKLY FIND THEY ABSOLUTELY

11:15.207 --> 11:16.776
MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE -- AND

11:16.842 --> 11:17.810
PARTICULARLY FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.780
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE

11:20.846 --> 11:22.081
A LOOK AT THE ATTACK ON VOTING

11:22.148 --> 11:25.518
RIGHTS AND HOW BEST TO FIGHT IT.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.019
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT'S IN

11:27.086 --> 11:28.621
THESE BILLS, BECAUSE IT'S A LOT.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.555
FOR INSTANCE, IN TEXAS -- WHERE,

11:29.622 --> 11:30.589
REMEMBER, THAT GUY CLAIMED YOU

11:30.656 --> 11:32.024
CAN'T FIND A SINGLE INSTANCE OF

11:32.091 --> 11:33.459
VOTER SUPPRESSION -- ONE THING

11:33.526 --> 11:34.727
THEIR BILL DOES IS ROLL BACK A

11:34.794 --> 11:36.562
LOT OF THE INNOVATIVE MEASURES

11:36.629 --> 11:37.430
PUT IN PLACE DURING THE PANDEMIC

11:37.496 --> 11:38.898
THAT MADE VOTING MORE

11:38.964 --> 11:39.965
ACCESSIBLE.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.133
AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT GETS RID

11:41.200 --> 11:42.735
OF 24-HOUR AND DRIVE-THROUGH

11:42.802 --> 11:44.670
VOTING, BOTH METHODS HARRIS

11:44.737 --> 11:47.106
COUNTY IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.274
AND AS THE COUNTY CLERK WHO

11:48.340 --> 11:49.408
OVERSAW THAT ELECTION POINTS

11:49.475 --> 11:50.776
OUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

11:50.843 --> 11:52.545
PRECINCTS WHERE THOSE METHODS

11:52.611 --> 11:53.145
WERE MOST POPULAR, IT'S CLEAR

11:53.212 --> 11:56.082
THE HARM IS PRETTY TARGETED.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.383
>> WHY ARE WE TAKING 24-HOUR

11:57.450 --> 11:58.417
VOTING AWAY?

11:58.484 --> 12:00.753
BECAUSE 56% OF VOTERS IN

12:00.820 --> 12:02.655
NOVEMBER WHO USED 24-HOUR VOTING

12:02.721 --> 12:04.657
WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.825
AND THEY KNOW THAT.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.792
WHY ARE WE TAKING DRIVE-THROUGH

12:06.859 --> 12:07.960
VOTING AWAY?

12:08.027 --> 12:10.262
BECAUSE 53% OF THOSE VOTERS IN

12:10.329 --> 12:13.165
2020 WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.767
>> John: YEAH, IT'S PRETTY

12:14.834 --> 12:16.869
OBVIOUS WHO YOU'RE TARGETING

12:16.936 --> 12:17.636
THERE.

12:17.703 --> 12:18.737
THEY MIGHT AS WELL SAY,

12:18.804 --> 12:20.172
"YOU CAN'T ARRIVE AT A POLLING

12:20.239 --> 12:21.140
PLACE EXHIBITING A FACE IN THE

12:21.207 --> 12:23.442
FENTY 300s OR HIGHER."

12:23.509 --> 12:25.211
SURE, YOU'RE NOT "SAYING" PEOPLE

12:25.277 --> 12:26.946
OF COLOR, BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT

12:27.012 --> 12:28.981
THE FUCK IS HAPPENING.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.916
AND IT'S NOT JUST DRIVE-THROUGH

12:30.983 --> 12:33.486
VOTING -- TEXAS, AND ALL THESE

12:33.552 --> 12:34.854
OTHER STATES, HAVE ADDED NEW

12:34.920 --> 12:36.088
BARRIERS TO VOTING BY MAIL,

12:36.155 --> 12:36.722
COINCIDENTALLY, JUST A YEAR

12:36.789 --> 12:38.390
AFTER ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE

12:38.457 --> 12:40.326
PERCENTAGE OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO

12:40.392 --> 12:41.961
VOTED BY MAIL SURGED PAST

12:42.027 --> 12:43.262
WHITE VOTERS.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.030
MEANWHILE, ALL THESE STATES HAVE

12:45.097 --> 12:46.532
PUT HARSHER VOTER I.D.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.933
REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE, EVEN

12:48.000 --> 12:50.536
THOUGH FEDERAL COURT CASES FOUND

12:50.603 --> 12:51.237
BLACK AND LATINO VOTERS IN

12:51.303 --> 12:52.571
STATES WITH HARSH LAWS

12:52.638 --> 12:53.272
DISPROPORTIONATELY LACKED ACCESS

12:53.339 --> 12:54.673
TO THE TYPE OF PHOTO IDS

12:54.740 --> 12:56.775
REQUIRED TO VOTE.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.411
SO ALREADY, WHEN YOU DO READ

12:59.478 --> 13:02.214
THESE BILLS, YOU FIND SOME SHIT

13:02.281 --> 13:04.250
IN PLAIN VIEW.

13:04.316 --> 13:04.984
IT'S LIKE A SECOND GRADER

13:05.050 --> 13:06.418
PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.786
YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THE COFFEE

13:07.853 --> 13:10.756
TABLE, BUD.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.291
I CAN SEE YOUR FEET, HANDS,

13:12.358 --> 13:13.392
FULL FACE, AND YOU'RE GIGGLING

13:13.459 --> 13:14.426
VERY LOUDLY.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.595
YOU DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB AT

13:16.662 --> 13:16.996
HIDING.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.430
AND SOME OF THOSE PUSHING THESE

13:18.497 --> 13:19.498
BILLS -- LIKE THIS STATE

13:19.565 --> 13:21.100
REPRESENTATIVE FROM GEORGIA --

13:21.167 --> 13:22.568
EVEN ARGUE THAT, IF A LAW DOES

13:22.635 --> 13:24.637
MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE, THAT'S

13:24.703 --> 13:28.440
NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING.

13:28.507 --> 13:29.642
>> I DO BELIEVE THAT VOTING IN

13:29.708 --> 13:31.076
THIS COUNTRY IS A PRIVILEGE

13:31.143 --> 13:31.810
AND --

13:31.877 --> 13:32.711
>> IT'S A RIGHT.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.247
>> AND IT'S A RIGHT AS WELL.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.216
BUT IT OUGHT TO MEAN ENOUGH

13:37.283 --> 13:38.717
WHERE YOU CAN PUT FORTH A LITTLE

13:38.784 --> 13:41.120
BIT OF EFFORT IN TRYING TO CAST

13:41.187 --> 13:41.420
YOUR BALLOT.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.655
>> John: OKAY, EXCEPT SOMETHING

13:42.721 --> 13:45.224
CAN'T BE A RIGHT AND A PRIVILEGE

13:45.291 --> 13:51.597
THAT YOU NEED TO WORK FOR.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.432
BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO COMPLETELY

13:53.499 --> 13:54.266
DIFFERENT THINGS -- FOR

13:54.333 --> 13:54.633
INSTANCE, IT'S A

13:54.700 --> 13:55.768
RIGHT FOR BRANDON CARUSO TO

13:55.834 --> 13:56.635
IMAGINE WHAT HOT, TAWDRY SEX

13:56.702 --> 13:57.469
WITH THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE WOULD

13:57.536 --> 13:57.703
BE LIKE.

13:57.770 --> 13:58.637
TO IMAGINE CLIMBING ON TOP OF IT

13:58.704 --> 13:59.104
AND TAKING HER ALL IN.

13:59.171 --> 13:59.738
TO THINK ABOUT THE CROWD

13:59.805 --> 14:00.706
WATCHING HIM -- YEAH, THAT'S

14:00.773 --> 14:01.440
RIGHT, THE STUDIO AUDIENCE IS

14:01.507 --> 14:02.741
THERE, AND THEY'RE ROOTING FOR

14:02.808 --> 14:03.342
HIM.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.577
BECAUSE HE DID IT.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.745
BRANDON FINALLY DID IT.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.348
HE'S FINALLY FUCKING THE WHEEL.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.116
IMAGINING HOW GOOD THAT'D FEEL

14:11.183 --> 14:12.551
IS BRANDON'S RIGHT.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.652
BUT ACTUALLY GETTING TO GRAB

14:13.719 --> 14:14.653
THOSE PEGS AND GIVE THE WHEEL A

14:14.720 --> 14:17.790
SPIN?

14:17.856 --> 14:18.857
THAT IS A PRIVILEGE THAT SHOULD

14:18.924 --> 14:20.292
TAKE YEARS OF EFFORT.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.160
AND LOOK, NONE OF THIS IS

14:21.227 --> 14:22.661
ANYTHING NEW.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.163
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING

14:24.230 --> 14:24.730
RESTRICTIVE VOTING LAWS FOR

14:24.797 --> 14:26.632
YEARS.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.133
BACK IN 2013, NORTH CAROLINA

14:28.200 --> 14:29.501
CRAFTED A LAW THAT MADE IT SO

14:29.568 --> 14:30.970
THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF

14:31.036 --> 14:32.404
VOTER I.D. WERE THE ONES

14:32.471 --> 14:34.206
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED BY WHITE

14:34.273 --> 14:35.407
PEOPLE, IN A BILL A FEDERAL

14:35.474 --> 14:36.909
APPEALS COURT LATER SAID

14:36.976 --> 14:37.977
TARGETED "AFRICAN-AMERICAN

14:38.043 --> 14:39.245
VOTERS WITH ALMOST SURGICAL

14:39.311 --> 14:42.514
PRECISION."

14:42.581 --> 14:43.749
WHICH HAS TO BE THE SECOND-WORST

14:43.816 --> 14:45.084
CONTEXT IN WHICH TO HEAR THAT

14:45.150 --> 14:46.919
PHRASE, TOPPED ONLY BY

14:46.986 --> 14:53.325
"SURGERY."

14:53.392 --> 14:54.727
"LOOK, MA'AM, YOUR HUSBAND'S

14:54.793 --> 14:55.661
SURGERY WAS...

14:55.728 --> 14:56.762
WE GOT IN THERE WITH 'ALMOST'

14:56.829 --> 14:57.196
SURGICAL PRECISION.

14:57.263 --> 14:57.830
MY TEAM'S NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT

14:57.896 --> 14:59.598
YET, BUT WE WERE REALLY CLOSE ON

14:59.665 --> 14:59.865
THIS ONE."

14:59.932 --> 15:00.699
AND FREQUENTLY, THESE LAWS HAVE

15:00.766 --> 15:01.567
BEEN HELPED ALONG BY WELL-FUNDED

15:01.634 --> 15:02.935
GROUPS LIKE THE HERITAGE

15:03.002 --> 15:04.003
FOUNDATION, WHOSE CO-FOUNDER,

15:04.069 --> 15:05.504
PAUL WEYRICH, FAMOUSLY ADMITTED,

15:05.571 --> 15:07.539
"I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO

15:07.606 --> 15:08.907
VOTE," AND WHOSE FORMER

15:08.974 --> 15:09.875
PRESIDENT, JIM DeMINT, ONCE

15:09.942 --> 15:11.677
APPROVINGLY SAID, "IN THE STATES

15:11.744 --> 15:12.678
WHERE THEY DO HAVE VOTER I.D.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.379
LAWS, YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN

15:13.445 --> 15:14.680
ELECTIONS BEGIN TO CHANGE

15:14.747 --> 15:15.981
TOWARDS MORE CONSERVATIVE

15:16.048 --> 15:16.582
CANDIDATES."

15:16.649 --> 15:17.349
PRETTY MUCH GIVING THE GAME

15:17.416 --> 15:22.855
AWAY.

15:22.921 --> 15:26.258
AND HERITAGE IS VERY MUCH STILL

15:26.325 --> 15:26.692
AT IT.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.793
JUST THIS YEAR, THE EXECUTIVE

15:27.860 --> 15:28.294
DIRECTOR OF THEIR SISTER

15:28.360 --> 15:28.894
ORGANIZATION, HERITAGE ACTION,

15:28.961 --> 15:29.461
ACTUALLY BRAGGED ABOUT THEIR

15:29.528 --> 15:30.729
ROLE IN PUSHING THIS YEAR'S NEW

15:30.796 --> 15:34.166
BILLS.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.768
>> WE ARE WORKING WITH STATE

15:35.834 --> 15:37.336
LEGISLATORS TO MAKE SURE THEY

15:37.403 --> 15:38.237
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY

15:38.304 --> 15:39.538
NEED TO DRAFT THE BILLS.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.840
IN SOME CASES WE DRAFT THEM FOR

15:41.907 --> 15:42.841
THEM.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.476
THEY HAVE BEEN HUGE VICTORIES

15:44.543 --> 15:46.011
SENDING BILLS ON MARCH 8TH.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.447
LITTLE FANFARE, HONESTLY, NOBODY

15:48.514 --> 15:49.415
EVEN NOTICED.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.582
MY TEAM LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND

15:50.649 --> 15:53.018
WE WERE LIKE, IT CAN'T BE THAT

15:53.085 --> 15:53.719
EASY.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.589
IT CAN'T BE THAT EASY.

15:57.656 --> 15:58.924
>> John: HOLD ON THERE,

15:58.991 --> 16:00.125
TJ MAXX IVANKA TRUMP.

16:00.192 --> 16:00.759
BECAUSE ANYONE SAYING "IT CAN'T

16:00.826 --> 16:01.927
BE THAT EASY" TO DO ANYTHING

16:01.994 --> 16:02.928
OTHER THAN SNEAKING THEIR OWN

16:02.995 --> 16:04.730
SNACKS INTO THE MOVIES

16:04.797 --> 16:06.832
ABSOLUTELY MUST BE STOPPED.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.634
THE POINT HERE IS, THIS HAS BEEN

16:08.701 --> 16:09.301
A CONCERTED, ORGANIZED EFFORT

16:09.368 --> 16:10.602
OVER MANY YEARS.

16:10.669 --> 16:11.270
BUT THE REASON IT NOW HAS A MUCH

16:11.337 --> 16:12.204
HIGHER CHANCE OF WORKING HAS TO

16:12.271 --> 16:12.838
DO WITH A PAIR OF SUPREME COURT

16:12.905 --> 16:13.972
DECISIONS THAT GUTTED THE

16:14.039 --> 16:16.842
LANDMARK 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT,

16:16.909 --> 16:17.343
WHICH PROHIBITED RACIAL

16:17.409 --> 16:18.911
DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.979
THE FIRST DECISION --

16:21.046 --> 16:23.549
SHELBY COUNTY VS. HOLDER --

16:23.615 --> 16:24.717
BASICALLY RELEASED THESE AREAS,

16:24.783 --> 16:26.051
WHICH HAD A PRIOR HISTORY OF

16:26.118 --> 16:27.653
DISCRIMINATORY VOTING LAWS, FROM

16:27.720 --> 16:29.021
HAVING TO RUN ANY NEW ONES PAST

16:29.088 --> 16:29.955
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FIRST

16:30.022 --> 16:30.689
BEFORE THEY TOOK EFFECT.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.726
AND THE SECOND --

16:33.792 --> 16:35.361
BRNOVICH VS. DNC -- ESSENTIALLY

16:35.427 --> 16:38.564
FOUND THAT EVEN IF A VOTING

16:38.630 --> 16:39.365
RESTRICTION HAS A DISCRIMINATORY

16:39.431 --> 16:41.100
IMPACT, THAT IN ITSELF DOESN'T

16:41.166 --> 16:42.634
NECESSARILY VIOLATE THE VOTING

16:42.701 --> 16:44.036
RIGHTS ACT.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.571
THOSE TWO DECISIONS BASICALLY

16:45.637 --> 16:46.805
MADE IT EASIER FOR SOME STATES

16:46.872 --> 16:48.841
TO PASS DISCRIMINATORY LAWS,

16:48.907 --> 16:50.042
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, MAKING

16:50.109 --> 16:51.977
IT MUCH HARDER FOR ANYONE TO

16:52.044 --> 16:53.545
CHALLENGE THEM.

16:53.612 --> 16:54.713
AND GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE

16:54.780 --> 16:56.248
DWINDLING WAYS YOU CAN STILL

16:56.315 --> 16:57.983
SUCCESSFULLY SUE UNDER THE VRA

16:58.050 --> 16:59.418
IS BY DEMONSTRATING A BILL IS

16:59.485 --> 17:02.121
RACIALLY MOTIVATED, IT'S HARDLY

17:02.187 --> 17:03.455
SURPRISING THAT THOSE PASSING

17:03.522 --> 17:05.324
THESE NEW LAWS HAVE BEEN QUICK

17:05.391 --> 17:07.626
TO SHUT DOWN ANY DISCUSSION OF

17:07.693 --> 17:10.629
THEIR RACIAL IMPACT.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.598
IN FACT, IN TEXAS, IN THE MIDST

17:12.664 --> 17:13.899
OF DEBATING THEIR NEW BILL,

17:13.966 --> 17:14.867
THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE

17:14.933 --> 17:16.535
MOMENT:

17:16.602 --> 17:18.537
>> MEMBERS, THIS IS A REMINDER

17:18.604 --> 17:19.571
TO EVERYONE TO BE CIVIL AND

17:19.638 --> 17:21.907
RESPECTFUL TO OUR COLLEAGUES AS

17:21.974 --> 17:24.576
WE DEBATE SB-1.

17:24.643 --> 17:25.944
THE CHAIR WOULD APPRECIATE

17:26.011 --> 17:27.980
MEMBERS NOT USING THE WORD

17:28.046 --> 17:35.921
"RACISM" THIS AFTERNOON.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.389
>> John: LOOK, LOOK, IF THE WORD

17:37.456 --> 17:38.791
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO USE IS

17:38.857 --> 17:41.794
"RACISM," I HATE TO BREAK IT TO

17:41.860 --> 17:42.428
YOU, BUT YOU'RE DOING A RACISM.

17:42.494 --> 17:43.729
SOMEONE MIGHT'VE TOLD YOU THAT

17:43.796 --> 17:44.930
SOONER, BUT IN FAIRNESS, YOU

17:44.997 --> 17:47.099
TOLD THEM THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.835
A CONSTANT THEME IN DEBATES OVER

17:49.902 --> 17:50.702
THESE BILLS IS BLACK-ELECTED

17:50.769 --> 17:51.537
OFFICIALS POINTING OUT THEIR

17:51.603 --> 17:52.905
IMPACT AND THEIR WHITE

17:52.971 --> 17:54.373
COLLEAGUES TELLING THEM TO BE

17:54.440 --> 17:55.707
QUIET.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.242
IN ARIZONA, BACK IN APRIL, THEY

17:57.309 --> 18:04.850
WERE DEBATING A BILL THAT MAKES

18:04.917 --> 18:06.385
IT HARD FOR MANY VOTERS TO

18:06.452 --> 18:06.985
RECEIVE AN EARLY BALLOT IN THE

18:07.052 --> 18:07.186
MAIL.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.253
BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ONE

18:08.320 --> 18:08.854
LAWMAKER STARTED POINTING OUT

18:08.921 --> 18:09.421
THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS

18:09.488 --> 18:10.656
THAT WOULD HAVE.

18:10.722 --> 18:14.726
>> THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL WILL

18:14.793 --> 18:15.327
MAKE IT HARDER FOR INDEPENDENT

18:15.394 --> 18:16.562
VOTERS, SENIORS, NATIVE

18:16.628 --> 18:17.830
AMERICANS, BLACK, BROWN, AND

18:17.896 --> 18:20.332
LOW-INCOME PEOPLE TO VOTE.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.400
TO EACH OF YOU --

18:21.467 --> 18:23.802
>> POINT OF ORDER.

18:23.869 --> 18:24.336
>> IN 2022 --

18:24.403 --> 18:25.237
>> POINT OF ORDER.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.839
>> I HAVE 12 WORDS FOR YOU.

18:26.905 --> 18:27.473
>> POINT OF ORDER.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.373
>> SHOW UP --

18:28.440 --> 18:29.408
>> POINT OF ORDER.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.342
>> SHOW OUT --

18:30.409 --> 18:31.510
>> POINT OF ORDER.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.812
>> AND VOTE.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.715
>> John: OKAY, YOU SHOULD NEVER

18:36.782 --> 18:38.283
SHOUT SOMEONE DOWN WHEN THEY

18:38.350 --> 18:39.117
ONLY WANT TO SAY 12 WORDS,

18:39.184 --> 18:40.686
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THOSE 12

18:40.752 --> 18:41.487
WORDS ARE, "HIS TESTICLES BECAME

18:41.553 --> 18:42.054
SWOLLEN.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.055
HIS FRIEND WAS WEEKS AWAY FROM

18:43.121 --> 18:48.961
GETTING MARRIED."

18:49.027 --> 18:50.596
AND LOOK, AND LOOK, I KNOW, THAT

18:50.662 --> 18:51.196
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

18:51.263 --> 18:51.763
BUT WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT

18:51.830 --> 18:53.866
MAN'S COLLEAGUE READ FROM THE

18:53.932 --> 18:55.400
RULE BOOK TO EXPLAIN HIS

18:55.467 --> 18:56.201
"POINT OF ORDER."

18:56.268 --> 18:57.135
>> IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 19A,

18:57.202 --> 18:59.137
NO MEMBER SHALL BE PERMITTED TO

18:59.204 --> 19:00.305
INDULGE IN PERSONALITIES, USE

19:00.372 --> 19:01.206
LANGUAGE PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE,

19:01.273 --> 19:03.008
ARRAIGN MOTIVES OF MEMBERS,

19:03.075 --> 19:03.876
CHARGE DELIBERATE

19:03.942 --> 19:04.676
MISREPRESENTATION, OR USE

19:04.743 --> 19:05.444
LANGUAGE TENDING TO HOLD A

19:05.511 --> 19:07.079
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OR SENATE UP

19:07.145 --> 19:08.714
TO CONTEMPT.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.982
AND I FEEL PERSONALLY THAT

19:10.048 --> 19:11.350
MOTIVES WERE ARRAIGNED OF

19:11.416 --> 19:14.620
MEMBERS, INCLUDING MYSELF, WITH

19:14.686 --> 19:16.622
REGARDS TO COLORED PEOPLE, BLACK

19:16.688 --> 19:17.356
PEOPLE, WHATEVER PEOPLE THIS

19:17.422 --> 19:18.357
INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO SINGLE OUT

19:18.423 --> 19:20.859
IN THEIR ABILITY TO VOTE.

19:20.926 --> 19:21.827
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S CORRECT

19:21.894 --> 19:23.095
AND I THINK HE SHOULD BE SAT

19:23.161 --> 19:24.296
DOWN AND HE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

19:24.363 --> 19:32.838
TO SPEAK.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.072
>> John: OH, FUCK ALL THE WAY

19:34.139 --> 19:34.239
OFF.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.040
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SITUATION

19:35.107 --> 19:35.541
IS.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.575
THE SECOND SOMEONE STARTS

19:36.642 --> 19:37.142
READING YOU THE RULES FROM A

19:37.209 --> 19:38.710
WEIRD, TINY BOOK, THEY CAN JUST

19:38.777 --> 19:39.978
FUCK RIGHT OFF INTO THE SUN.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.179
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, IF YOU SAY

19:41.246 --> 19:42.848
THE WORDS "COLORED PEOPLE" AND

19:42.915 --> 19:44.116
IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY

19:44.182 --> 19:45.317
"NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE

19:45.384 --> 19:50.556
ADVANCEMENT OF," YOU ARE

19:50.622 --> 19:53.592
OFFICIALLY IN TIME-OUT.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.993
BUT REPUBLICANS CANNOT JUST

19:55.060 --> 19:56.562
CLAIM THEY'RE NOT BEING RACIST

19:56.628 --> 19:57.663
IN PUSHING THESE BILLS -- THEY

19:57.729 --> 19:58.864
DO STILL NEED A REASON FOR THEM.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.165
SO WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THAT

20:00.232 --> 20:00.399
REASON?

20:00.465 --> 20:01.833
WELL, FOR YEARS, THEY CLAIMED

20:01.900 --> 20:03.335
THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF VOTER

20:03.402 --> 20:04.903
FRAUD, DESPITE THE FACT ACTUAL

20:04.970 --> 20:06.138
INSTANCES OF THAT ARE INCREDIBLY

20:06.204 --> 20:07.472
RARE.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.074
SO THEY'VE NOW SHIFTED THEIR

20:09.141 --> 20:10.242
JUSTIFICATION FROM SOMETHING

20:10.309 --> 20:12.110
MEASURABLE -- WHAT PEOPLE ARE

20:12.177 --> 20:13.145
DOING -- TO SOMETHING MUCH LESS

20:13.211 --> 20:14.580
TANGIBLE -- WHAT THEY'RE

20:14.646 --> 20:16.114
FEELING.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.550
JUST LISTEN TO THE LIEUTENANT

20:18.617 --> 20:19.117
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS MAKING THAT

20:19.184 --> 20:19.918
EXACT PITCH.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.019
>> I'VE BEEN ASKED WHY THIS BILL

20:21.086 --> 20:22.354
IS NEEDED.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.357
VERY SIMPLE.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.458
THE BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE

20:26.525 --> 20:27.426
AMERICANS NO LONGER TRUST THE

20:27.492 --> 20:31.129
SYSTEM.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.598
AND A COUNTRY WHERE VOTERS DO

20:32.664 --> 20:35.200
NOT TRUST THE SYSTEM IS A

20:35.267 --> 20:39.805
COUNTRY IN PERIL.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.908
>> John: YEAH, OKAY, BUT YOU

20:42.975 --> 20:44.576
STILL NEED A REASON TO LEGISLATE

20:44.643 --> 20:45.010
AGAINST SOMETHING.

20:45.077 --> 20:45.644
YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT BASED ON A

20:45.711 --> 20:45.944
FEELING.

20:46.011 --> 20:46.545
IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I'D

20:46.612 --> 20:47.212
PROPOSE A BILL TO OUTLAW

20:47.279 --> 20:49.147
TILDA SWINTON.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.315
WHY?

20:50.382 --> 20:51.016
TOO CREEPY.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.184
SHE LOOKS LIKE A GHOST WHO KNOWS

20:52.250 --> 20:53.151
EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN YOU'LL DIE

20:53.218 --> 20:54.052
BUT WON'T TELL YOU BECAUSE IT'S

20:54.119 --> 20:56.455
MORE FUN FOR HER THAT WAY.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.156
BUT I WILL SAY, DESPITE THE FACT

20:58.223 --> 21:00.025
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FOUND

21:00.092 --> 21:01.193
THE LAST ELECTION TO BE

21:01.259 --> 21:02.527
"THE MOST SECURE IN AMERICAN

21:02.594 --> 21:03.895
HISTORY," THE TRUTH IS, MANY

21:03.962 --> 21:05.197
REPUBLICANS DON'T TRUST THE

21:05.263 --> 21:06.665
SYSTEM.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.533
BUT THE REASON FOR THAT MIGHT BE

21:08.600 --> 21:09.901
THAT PEOPLE LIKE DAN PATRICK

21:09.968 --> 21:13.238
SPENT ALL LAST YEAR CALLING

21:13.305 --> 21:14.673
VOTING BY MAIL A SCAM BY

21:14.740 --> 21:16.141
DEMOCRATS TO STEAL THE ELECTION,

21:16.208 --> 21:18.243
AND SAYING SHIT LIKE THIS:

21:18.310 --> 21:20.245
>> LOOK, WHEN YOU HAVE AN

21:20.312 --> 21:21.613
OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL A VOTE, THE

21:21.680 --> 21:24.182
DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

21:24.249 --> 21:26.284
IT.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.152
AND YOU CAN SWING THE BALLOTS

21:27.219 --> 21:27.552
EASILY, ED.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.620
I COULD GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS,

21:28.687 --> 21:29.421
BUT I WON'T, BECAUSE I DON'T

21:29.488 --> 21:30.155
WANT TO GIVE ANYONE IDEAS HOW

21:30.222 --> 21:30.989
YOU CAN EASILY STEAL THOUSANDS

21:31.056 --> 21:31.857
OF VOTES.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.092
>> John: OH, COME ON, DAN.

21:34.159 --> 21:34.993
"I CAN GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS,

21:35.060 --> 21:37.329
BUT I WON'T" IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS

21:37.396 --> 21:41.099
LIE.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.736
IT'S UP THERE WITH

21:44.803 --> 21:46.038
"I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, SHE GOES

21:46.104 --> 21:48.740
TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, YOU

21:48.807 --> 21:54.046
WOULDN'T KNOW HER",

21:54.112 --> 21:55.147
OR "I'M FIVE

21:55.213 --> 21:57.883
MINUTES AWAY!" OR

21:57.949 --> 21:58.417
"I'VE NEVER

21:58.483 --> 21:59.117
SEXUALLY FANTASIZED ABOUT

21:59.184 --> 21:59.751
LOBSTERS."

21:59.818 --> 22:00.185
WE'VE ALL DONE THAT.

22:00.252 --> 22:00.819
IT'S NATURAL.

22:00.886 --> 22:01.520
THEY'RE STOIC AND TERRIFYING,

22:01.586 --> 22:02.254
THE PERFECT SEXUAL COMBINATION.

22:02.320 --> 22:02.954
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR IF NOT

22:03.021 --> 22:04.222
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT

22:04.289 --> 22:04.656
AND ALSO HATES YOU?

22:04.723 --> 22:05.157
THAT'S LOBSTERS, BUDDY!

22:05.223 --> 22:06.291
WE WANT THEIR CLAWS PINCHING OUR

22:06.358 --> 22:06.558
EARLOBES.

22:06.625 --> 22:07.659
NOT TOO HARD, BUT HONESTLY?

22:07.726 --> 22:08.060
HARD.

22:08.126 --> 22:08.660
LIKE WHEN THE DENTIST SAYS

22:08.727 --> 22:09.394
"DOES THIS HURT?" AND YOU SAY

22:09.461 --> 22:10.462
"NO" BUT YOU MEAN "YES" BECAUSE

22:10.529 --> 22:11.363
YOU'RE KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT THIS

22:11.430 --> 22:12.064
DENTIST CAN DO WHEN PUSHED.

22:12.130 --> 22:12.731
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LEGS A

22:12.798 --> 22:13.031
LOBSTER HAS?

22:13.098 --> 22:14.032
I'LL TELL YOU:

22:14.099 --> 22:15.367
A SEX AMOUNT.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.269
BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK.

22:17.335 --> 22:18.804
BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK.

22:18.870 --> 22:19.738
THAT MANY.

22:19.805 --> 22:20.639
FUCK ME STUPID,

22:20.706 --> 22:24.209
YOU WEAPONIZED OCEAN BITCH.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.711
HERE IS FOUR HIT REASONS WHY IT

22:25.777 --> 22:26.311
WOULD BE COOL TO FUCK AN

22:26.378 --> 22:27.612
ADULT-SIZED LOBSTER ON HOLIDAY:

22:27.679 --> 22:28.213
THEY LIVE A LONG TIME, MEANING

22:28.280 --> 22:29.715
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING;

22:29.781 --> 22:30.682
THEIR BACKS ARE INCREDIBLY

22:30.749 --> 22:32.617
STRONG AND RESPONSIVE --

22:32.684 --> 22:33.218
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY

22:33.285 --> 22:34.519
THAT'S GOOD SEXUALLY;

22:34.586 --> 22:35.721
THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF RACISM;

22:35.787 --> 22:36.221
AND THEY CAN'T TALK AND

22:36.288 --> 22:37.723
RUIN THE MOOD.

22:37.789 --> 22:38.990
WE ASK "IS THIS GOOD?"

22:39.057 --> 22:40.025
AND THEY JUST SORT OF WOBBLE

22:40.092 --> 22:41.193
THEIR HORRIBLE BLACK EYES

22:41.259 --> 22:43.295
AROUND.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.963
MY POINT HERE IS, WE ALL THINK

22:45.030 --> 22:45.697
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH BURDENED,

22:45.764 --> 22:47.232
UNHAPPY LOBSTERS ALL THE TIME,

22:47.299 --> 22:48.967
EVEN IN WINTER, AND THAT'S

22:49.034 --> 22:50.135
WHY WE SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO

22:50.202 --> 22:51.470
DAN PATRICK OR, HONESTLY,

22:51.536 --> 22:52.037
WHOEVER IT WAS I WAS TALKING

22:52.104 --> 22:57.209
ABOUT EARLIER.

22:57.275 --> 22:57.609
I DON'T REMEMBER.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.076
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

22:58.143 --> 22:59.077
THERE'S A REASON PATRICK CAN

22:59.144 --> 23:00.378
GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS FOR

23:00.445 --> 23:01.279
DEMOCRATS STEALING ELECTIONS,

23:01.346 --> 23:02.514
BUT NO EVIDENCE, AND THAT'S

23:02.581 --> 23:03.782
BECAUSE -- DESPITE SAYING HE'D

23:03.849 --> 23:05.250
PAY UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS FOR

23:05.317 --> 23:06.818
EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD --

23:06.885 --> 23:08.053
HE HAS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, NOT

23:08.120 --> 23:10.422
PAID OUT.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.390
AND LOCAL ELECTION SUPERVISORS

23:12.457 --> 23:13.425
THEMSELVES WILL TELL YOU THESE

23:13.492 --> 23:14.960
BILLS MAKE NO SENSE.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.895
THE FLORIDA SUPERVISORS OF

23:16.962 --> 23:18.163
ELECTIONS STRONGLY OPPOSED THEIR

23:18.230 --> 23:19.030
STATE'S NEW BILL, WITH ONE

23:19.097 --> 23:21.433
REPUBLICAN SUPERVISOR TELLING A

23:21.500 --> 23:22.501
REPORTER, "IT'S STUPID, OKAY?

23:22.567 --> 23:23.635
IT WAS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A

23:23.702 --> 23:26.505
PROBLEM."

23:26.571 --> 23:27.239
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE STEP WORSE

23:27.305 --> 23:29.574
THAN THAT.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.209
BECAUSE THESE ARE SOLUTIONS TO

23:31.276 --> 23:33.779
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN

23:33.845 --> 23:35.113
DELIBERATELY AND STRATEGICALLY

23:35.180 --> 23:37.749
MANUFACTURED.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.084
THE GAME'S PRETTY OBVIOUS:

23:39.151 --> 23:39.918
USE BULLSHIT CLAIMS TO STIR UP

23:39.985 --> 23:41.019
BASELESS FEAR TO PASS

23:41.086 --> 23:42.087
UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS

23:42.154 --> 23:42.754
TARGETING PARTICULAR GROUPS.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.122
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THIS

23:44.189 --> 23:46.057
WEEK.

23:46.124 --> 23:52.197
THE NONSENSE "AUDIT" IN ARIZONA

23:52.264 --> 23:53.265
COME TO A HUMILIATING CONCLUSION

23:53.331 --> 23:54.132
THAT FAILED TO SHOW, YET AGAIN,

23:54.199 --> 23:54.733
THAT TRUMP WAS CHEATED OF

23:54.800 --> 23:56.635
VICTORY -- BUT ITS ORGANIZERS

23:56.701 --> 23:57.102
STILL RECOMMENDED THE

23:57.169 --> 23:57.803
LEGISLATURE TIGHTEN UP THE

23:57.869 --> 23:58.603
ELECTION PROCESS TO PROVIDE

23:58.670 --> 23:59.571
ADDITIONAL CERTAINTY GOING

23:59.638 --> 24:03.508
FORWARD.

24:03.575 --> 24:04.376
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY FUCKING

24:04.442 --> 24:04.543
DID.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.011
IT'S ALL A SHAMELESS ATTEMPT TO

24:06.077 --> 24:06.812
GET TO THE SAME PLACE.

24:06.878 --> 24:10.115
SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT ALL

24:10.182 --> 24:12.117
THIS?

24:12.184 --> 24:14.553
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE'S

24:14.619 --> 24:17.389
PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT

24:17.455 --> 24:18.423
ADDRESSES MANY OF THE PROBLEMS

24:18.490 --> 24:19.591
YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

24:19.658 --> 24:20.759
THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS

24:20.826 --> 24:21.359
ADVANCEMENT ACT WOULD RESTORE

24:21.426 --> 24:22.060
PARTS OF THE VRA THE SUPREME

24:22.127 --> 24:22.928
COURT GUTTED.

24:22.994 --> 24:23.662
AND MORE SUBSTANTIALLY, THERE'S

24:23.728 --> 24:24.529
THE FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT, WHICH

24:24.596 --> 24:25.163
WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE

24:25.230 --> 24:26.531
VOTING BY MAIL AVAILABLE FOR

24:26.598 --> 24:27.332
EVERY VOTER, MAKE ELECTION DAY A

24:27.399 --> 24:28.033
PUBLIC HOLIDAY, AND MAKE

24:28.099 --> 24:29.301
AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION A

24:29.367 --> 24:30.335
NATIONAL STANDARD.

24:30.402 --> 24:33.438
UNFORTUNATELY, MITCH

24:33.505 --> 24:37.309
McCONNELL'S ANNOUNCED HE'LL

24:37.375 --> 24:38.910
FILIBUSTER ANY ATTEMPTS TO GET

24:38.977 --> 24:44.583
EITHER OF THOSE ACTS PASSED.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.150
SO IF WE WANT TO PROTECT THE

24:45.217 --> 24:46.384
BALLOT -- WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY

24:46.451 --> 24:47.018
SHOULD -- WE NEED TO END THE

24:47.085 --> 24:49.654
FILIBUSTER.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.456
AND YOU'D HOPE EVERY NATIONAL

24:51.523 --> 24:53.158
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN WOULD BE

24:53.225 --> 24:54.893
SCREAMING ABOUT THIS, BUT SOME

24:54.960 --> 24:57.596
ARE DOING THE OPPOSITE.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.129
JOE MANCHIN'S CONSISTENTLY

24:58.196 --> 24:58.630
DEFENDED THE FILIBUSTER.

24:58.697 --> 24:59.397
AND WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF

24:59.464 --> 25:03.101
HE SUPPORTS DOING AWAY WITH IT

25:03.168 --> 25:04.236
TO SPECIFICALLY PROTECT

25:04.302 --> 25:04.836
VOTING RIGHTS, THIS

25:04.903 --> 25:05.804
WAS HIS MADDENING ANSWER.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.941
>> WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS

25:10.008 --> 25:10.876
GET WRAPPED UP, RIGHT NOW, IN

25:10.942 --> 25:11.877
THE ARGUMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT

25:11.943 --> 25:12.744
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE FILIBUSTER

25:12.811 --> 25:15.547
OR -- LOOK, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,

25:15.614 --> 25:17.782
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM FROM VOTING.

25:17.849 --> 25:18.783
YOU TRIED LAST TIME.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.986
MORE PEOPLE VOTED LAST TIME THAN

25:21.052 --> 25:22.921
ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

25:22.988 --> 25:23.688
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST

25:23.755 --> 25:24.456
PANDEMIC IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.759
MORE PEOPLE DID.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.561
AND THEY SHOWED UP.

25:29.628 --> 25:30.829
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW UP AGAIN.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.664
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.566
>> John: SURE, JOE.

25:34.633 --> 25:35.400
MAYBE.

25:35.467 --> 25:36.434
OR MAYBE THEY'LL SHOW UP AND GET

25:36.501 --> 25:36.935
TURNED AWAY, BECAUSE OF

25:37.002 --> 25:39.104
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING

25:39.170 --> 25:39.971
ABOUT.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.072
BIDEN'S WHITE HOUSE EVEN

25:41.139 --> 25:42.774
REPORTEDLY TOLD VOTING RIGHTS

25:42.841 --> 25:45.944
GROUPS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO

25:46.011 --> 25:47.012
OUTORGANIZE VOTER SUPPRESSION.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.113
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT ISN'T.

25:48.179 --> 25:48.446
IT JUST ISN'T.

25:48.513 --> 25:49.648
THAT'S WHAT VOTER SUPPRESSION

25:49.714 --> 25:51.549
IS, AS ACTIVISTS AND ACTUAL

25:51.616 --> 25:55.420
ORGANIZERS WILL TELL YOU:

25:55.487 --> 25:56.855
>> I'M VERY UPSET WITH

25:56.922 --> 25:58.924
PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE I FEEL

25:58.990 --> 26:00.992
LIKE HE'S NOT ADVOCATING FOR US

26:01.059 --> 26:01.459
IN THIS MOMENT.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.328
WHAT I WANT HIM TO SEE IS --

26:03.395 --> 26:04.863
IS TO STOP SAYING TO OUTORGANIZE

26:04.930 --> 26:05.997
VOTER SUPPRESSION.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.799
I WANT HIM TO SUPPORT THE

26:07.866 --> 26:09.634
ELIMINATION OF THE FILIBUSTER.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.303
I WANT HIM TO SUPPORT AND

26:11.369 --> 26:12.170
ENDORSE THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT

26:12.237 --> 26:12.804
BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO STEP UP --

26:12.871 --> 26:13.271
STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.839
WE ARE AT A -- AT A CROSSROADS.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.074
WE NEED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

26:16.141 --> 26:16.374
IMMEDIATELY.

26:16.441 --> 26:17.175
IF HE'S INCAPABLE OF THAT, HE

26:17.242 --> 26:21.813
NEEDS TO BE QUIET AND GO.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.714
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

26:22.781 --> 26:23.415
THE SOLUTION TO BEING BLOCKED

26:23.481 --> 26:23.915
FROM VOTING CAN'T BE TO

26:23.982 --> 26:25.717
"JUST VOTE" FOR THE SAME REASON

26:25.784 --> 26:27.452
THAT THE SOLUTION TO BEING

26:27.519 --> 26:28.186
LOCKED OUT OF YOUR HOME CAN'T BE

26:28.253 --> 26:29.187
TO TELL SOMEONE "JUST GO INSIDE

26:29.254 --> 26:32.090
AND GET THE KEYS."

26:32.157 --> 26:33.158
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING

26:33.224 --> 26:33.358
ABOUT?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.125
I'M LOCKED OUT.

26:34.192 --> 26:37.862
HOW ARE YOU NOT UNDERSTANDING

26:37.929 --> 26:39.130
THIS SITUATION?

26:39.197 --> 26:39.764
ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY TO JOES

26:39.831 --> 26:40.532
BIDEN, MANCHIN, AND ANY OTHER

26:40.598 --> 26:43.068
JOE WHO WANTS TO SKIP DOING

26:43.134 --> 26:44.602
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT AND INSTEAD

26:44.669 --> 26:46.838
RELY ON THE PERSEVERANCE OF THE

26:46.905 --> 26:48.606
AMERICAN SPIRIT: STOP FUCKING

26:48.673 --> 26:49.674
AROUND AND FIX THIS.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.010
I KNOW IT'S TEMPTING TO BANG THE

26:52.077 --> 26:52.911
OPTIMISTIC DRUM THAT MORE

26:52.978 --> 26:54.713
AMERICANS SHOWED UP LAST YEAR

26:54.779 --> 26:57.983
THAN EVER BEFORE, AND BY GUM,

26:58.049 --> 27:00.318
THEY'LL DO IT AGAIN, BUT HERE'S

27:00.385 --> 27:01.753
THE THING: THE REPUBLICANS KNOW

27:01.820 --> 27:04.055
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN -- THAT'S WHY

27:04.122 --> 27:04.789
THEY'RE DOING THIS.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.057
AND ANYONE UNWILLING TO DO WHAT

27:06.124 --> 27:07.025
IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THIS

27:07.092 --> 27:09.094
PROBLEM SHOULD -- AND I CAN'T

27:09.160 --> 27:10.295
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO BORROW THIS

27:10.362 --> 27:12.430
QUOTE -- REALLY BE SAT DOWN AND

27:12.497 --> 27:14.799
NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

27:14.866 --> 27:20.305
AND NOW THIS.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.608
>> Announcer: AND NOW, THE

27:23.675 --> 27:25.777
UTTERLY SPECTACULAR DRAMATIC

27:25.844 --> 27:27.078
PAUSES OF ESPN'S

27:27.145 --> 27:27.479
STEPHEN A. SMITH.

27:27.545 --> 27:28.346
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE

27:28.413 --> 27:31.883
WINNERS AND LOSERS...

27:31.950 --> 27:35.153
FOR THIS SUMMER ALREADY...

27:35.220 --> 27:42.627
HOUSTON, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

27:42.694 --> 27:45.230
SPEAKING OF PROBLEMS...

27:45.296 --> 27:51.069
I'M PRETTY TICKED OFF!

27:51.136 --> 27:55.106
OH, AND MY TICKED!

27:55.173 --> 27:56.708
PUT IT MILDLY, I AM HAVING A

27:56.775 --> 28:04.783
VERY BAD DAY!

28:04.849 --> 28:10.789
I AM IN NO MOOD!

28:10.855 --> 28:18.463
SO WHAT HAPPENS?

28:18.530 --> 28:26.171
NOT ONE, NOT ONE, NOT ONE!

28:26.237 --> 28:30.775
IT'S NOT BAD.

28:30.842 --> 28:31.009
NOT BAD.

28:31.076 --> 28:59.737
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING...

28:59.804 --> 29:04.109
MELO IS GONE!

29:04.175 --> 29:05.009
>> John: MOVING ON.

29:05.076 --> 29:05.877
BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, A QUICK

29:05.944 --> 29:06.778
WORD ABOUT THE OUTDOORS.

29:06.845 --> 29:07.378
IT'S HOME TO LAKES, TREES, AND

29:07.445 --> 29:08.246
THE CANDY WITCH WHO LURES

29:08.313 --> 29:11.049
CHILDREN TO THEIR DOOM.

29:11.116 --> 29:11.649
IT'S GREAT!

29:11.716 --> 29:12.550
SPECIFICALLY, I WANT TO TALK

29:12.617 --> 29:13.118
ABOUT ONE WAY TO CONSERVE THE

29:13.184 --> 29:16.955
PRECIOUS NATURE THE OUTDOORS

29:17.021 --> 29:17.622
CONTAINS, AND THAT IS

29:17.689 --> 29:18.089
DUCK STAMPS.

29:18.156 --> 29:18.823
IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM,

29:18.890 --> 29:21.526
I'LL LET THIS CHARMINGLY STILTED

29:21.593 --> 29:22.694
1990s VIDEO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.295
>> THE MAJORITY OF STAMPS ARE

29:24.362 --> 29:24.896
SOLD TO WATERFOWL HUNTERS WHO,

29:24.963 --> 29:25.763
BY LAW, MUST HAVE A FEDERAL

29:25.830 --> 29:27.232
DUCK STAMP IN THEIR POSSESSION

29:27.298 --> 29:30.335
WHILE HUNTING.

29:30.401 --> 29:31.302
INCREASINGLY OTHERS, YOUNG

29:31.369 --> 29:32.871
AND OLD, ARE VOLUNTARILY BUYING

29:32.937 --> 29:34.339
FEDERAL DUCK STAMPS AS AN

29:34.405 --> 29:36.474
EFFECTIVE, DIRECT WAY TO HELP

29:36.541 --> 29:38.076
CONSERVE OUR NATION'S WATERFOWL

29:38.143 --> 29:43.314
AND OTHER WILDLIFE.

29:43.381 --> 29:44.115
>> John: NOW, I KNOW THAT LOOKS

29:44.182 --> 29:45.049
SWEET, BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE

29:45.116 --> 29:45.717
THERE IS THE SCREAMING THAT

29:45.783 --> 29:46.584
HAPPENED AS SOON AS THOSE TWO

29:46.651 --> 29:46.918
KIDS GOT HOME.

29:46.985 --> 29:47.952
"WHAT ARE THESE?

29:48.019 --> 29:49.120
DUCK STAMPS?

29:49.187 --> 29:50.221
I SENT YOU TO THE STORE FOR

29:50.288 --> 29:51.189
MEDICINE!

29:51.256 --> 29:52.390
LISTEN TO ME, YOUR SISTER IS

29:52.457 --> 29:54.092
ABOUT TO DIE BECAUSE YOU KEEP

29:54.159 --> 29:56.227
SPENDING ALL HER INSULIN MONEY

29:56.294 --> 29:59.864
ON BIRD STICKERS!"

29:59.931 --> 30:01.466
BUT IT'S TRUE: EVERY YEAR, THE

30:01.533 --> 30:04.235
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES A

30:04.302 --> 30:05.036
DUCK STAMP, WHICH ISN'T A

30:05.103 --> 30:05.637
POSTAGE STAMP, BUT IS

30:05.703 --> 30:06.404
EFFECTIVELY A KIND OF PERMIT FOR

30:06.471 --> 30:07.138
HUNTERS.

30:07.205 --> 30:08.306
THEY CURRENTLY COST $25, AND

30:08.373 --> 30:09.807
THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN A HUGE

30:09.874 --> 30:12.210
SUCCESS STORY FOR CONSERVATION,

30:12.277 --> 30:14.879
WITH 98 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR

30:14.946 --> 30:16.314
THAT THEY MAKE GOING TO

30:16.381 --> 30:16.848
PRESERVING WETLANDS.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.116
SINCE 1934, THE STAMPS HAVE

30:18.183 --> 30:18.816
RAISED MORE THAN A BILLION

30:18.883 --> 30:19.951
DOLLARS TO PROTECT OVER

30:20.018 --> 30:21.519
6 MILLION ACRES OF WETLANDS

30:21.586 --> 30:23.588
HABITAT.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.789
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE

30:24.856 --> 30:25.590
NON-HUNTERS LIKE TO COLLECT THEM

30:25.657 --> 30:29.294
TOO.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.328
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.596
THERE'VE BEEN SOME BEAUTIES IN

30:31.663 --> 30:33.097
THE PAST, LIKE THIS 1960s STAMP

30:33.164 --> 30:34.632
FEATURING A FAMILY OF REDHEAD

30:34.699 --> 30:35.567
DUCKS, THIS 1980s ONE

30:35.633 --> 30:37.902
SHOWCASING A MAJESTIC

30:37.969 --> 30:38.570
SNOW GOOSE, AND THIS MOTTLED

30:38.636 --> 30:39.971
DUCK FROM THE 2000s WHO IS

30:40.038 --> 30:41.706
ABSOLUTELY RIPPED.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.074
CHECK OUT THE DEFINITION ON THAT

30:43.141 --> 30:44.275
BACK.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.376
QUICK QUESTION, DOES THIS STAMP

30:45.443 --> 30:48.813
COME WITH MOO SHU PANCAKES?

30:48.880 --> 30:52.317
'CAUSE THAT DUCK IS SHREDDED.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.219
BUT THE BEST THING ABOUT THE

30:54.285 --> 30:55.153
DUCK STAMP IS HOW EACH YEAR'S IS

30:55.220 --> 30:56.621
CHOSEN -- BECAUSE IT'S AN

30:56.688 --> 30:57.155
ANNUAL, NATIONWIDE ART

30:57.222 --> 30:58.189
COMPETITION.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.757
AND THE JUDGING OF IT IS NO

30:59.824 --> 31:02.994
JOKE.

31:03.061 --> 31:04.963
>> THE JUDGES INDEPENDENTLY VOTE

31:05.029 --> 31:06.431
ON EACH ENTRY.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.966
THEY CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE

31:08.032 --> 31:10.835
VISUAL IMPACT OF THE ART AND HOW

31:10.902 --> 31:14.772
IT MIGHT LOOK AS A STAMP BUT

31:14.839 --> 31:15.673
ALSO WHETHER IT IS ANATOMICALLY

31:15.740 --> 31:16.474
ACCURATE.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.208
>> John: IT'S TRUE: DUCKS MUST

31:17.275 --> 31:18.276
NOT ONLY BE BEAUTIFUL, BUT

31:18.343 --> 31:19.978
ANATOMICALLY ACCURATE.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.679
AN ESPECIALLY FUN REQUIREMENT,

31:21.746 --> 31:25.883
GIVEN THAT YOU'RE PAINTING AN

31:25.950 --> 31:26.751
ANIMAL THAT HAS -- AS WE'VE

31:26.818 --> 31:27.485
MENTIONED ON THIS SHOW BEFORE --

31:27.552 --> 31:28.686
A LONG, CORKSCREW-SHAPED PENIS.

31:28.753 --> 31:29.854
IT'S A FACT THAT DROVE US TO

31:29.921 --> 31:30.989
CREATE THIS IMAGE OF DONALD DUCK

31:31.055 --> 31:32.490
THAT -- AS OF TAPING -- DISNEY

31:32.557 --> 31:33.825
HAD NOT YET SUED US OVER.

31:33.891 --> 31:34.826
AND ONCE YOU START LOOKING INTO

31:34.892 --> 31:36.361
THE DUCK STAMP CONTEST, IT'S NOT

31:36.427 --> 31:37.629
LONG BEFORE YOU FIND SOME DRAMA.

31:37.695 --> 31:39.330
THERE ARE BIG NAMES, LIKE THE

31:39.397 --> 31:40.598
HAUTMAN BROTHERS, AN ACTUAL

31:40.665 --> 31:41.833
DUCK DYNASTY WHO, GOING INTO

31:41.899 --> 31:43.534
THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION, HAD

31:43.601 --> 31:46.871
COLLECTIVELY WON IT 13 TIMES.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.773
THEY ARE TRULY THE DUCK

31:48.840 --> 31:50.708
G.O.A.T.s.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.543
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A HEATED

31:52.610 --> 31:55.113
RIVALRY BETWEEN ONE OF THE

31:55.179 --> 31:56.214
REGULAR, TRADITIONAL DUCK

31:56.281 --> 31:57.048
ARTISTS, TIM TAYLOR, AND HIS

31:57.115 --> 31:58.116
MORE AVANT-GARDE RIVAL,

31:58.182 --> 31:59.550
ROB McBROOM, WHO TIM TAYLOR HAS

31:59.617 --> 32:01.786
NO TIME FOR.

32:01.853 --> 32:05.290
>> ROB McBROOM IS A GUY WHO

32:05.356 --> 32:07.258
ENTERS THE DUCK STAMP EVERY

32:07.325 --> 32:08.092
YEAR.

32:08.159 --> 32:08.960
AND EVERY YEAR, HE VIOLATES THE

32:09.027 --> 32:10.295
RULES, HE BREAKS EVERY RULE OF

32:10.361 --> 32:11.863
THE CONTEST, AND HE'S REALLY

32:11.929 --> 32:13.398
JUST AN ATTENTION SEEKER.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.466
>> HE'S FOUND THIS CONTEST THAT

32:15.533 --> 32:17.135
PEOPLE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND

32:17.201 --> 32:19.203
THE CONTESTANTS WORK REALLY HARD

32:19.270 --> 32:20.738
ON THE ENTRIES AND HE MOCKS IT.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.841
HE DOES PAINTINGS THAT MOCK IT.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.978
>> John: YEAH, TO BE FAIR,

32:27.045 --> 32:28.012
HE DOES KIND OF DO THAT.

32:28.079 --> 32:28.846
HE'S SUBMITTED PAINTINGS TO

32:28.913 --> 32:29.681
FEDERAL AND STATE CONTESTS THAT

32:29.747 --> 32:31.049
CLEARLY GO AGAINST THE DESIRED

32:31.115 --> 32:32.083
AESTHETIC, LIKE THIS ONE OF TWO

32:32.150 --> 32:32.950
CARTOONISH DUCKS, AND WHATEVER

32:33.017 --> 32:34.686
THE FUCK THIS IS.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.654
ALSO, ROB McBROOM IS VERY MUCH

32:36.721 --> 32:38.756
AWARE OF TIM TAYLOR'S CRITICISM

32:38.823 --> 32:40.892
AND TROLLED HIM FOR YEARS, EVEN

32:40.958 --> 32:42.527
TAKING PREVIOUS TAYLOR PAINTINGS

32:42.593 --> 32:45.763
AND PARODYING THEM.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.231
>> THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU

32:47.298 --> 32:48.499
CAN GET TO TIM'S ORIGINAL

32:48.566 --> 32:50.101
WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING THE

32:50.168 --> 32:51.569
SIZE, AND IT'S COMPLETELY BUILT

32:51.636 --> 32:52.537
FROM SCRATCH.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.539
>> THIS IS THE PIECE OF WORK

32:54.605 --> 32:57.108
THAT ROB McBROOM TOOK OFF OF THE

32:57.175 --> 32:58.976
INTERNET TO "ABSTRACT."

32:59.043 --> 33:00.945
>> THE LITTLE BITS I'VE LEARNED

33:01.012 --> 33:04.115
ABOUT HIM, I'M LIKE, OKAY, HE

33:04.182 --> 33:04.949
OBVIOUSLY HATES BARACK OBAMA,

33:05.016 --> 33:05.917
AND HE HATES COMMUNISM.

33:05.983 --> 33:06.951
SO I DECIDED TO LOAD IT UP WITH

33:07.018 --> 33:10.121
IMAGERY WITH THAT.

33:10.188 --> 33:11.589
>> HERE IS BARACK OBAMA'S BIRTH

33:11.656 --> 33:15.059
CERTIFICATE THAT HE RELEASED.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.395
HERE'S THE EYE OF THE DUCK,

33:17.462 --> 33:23.801
WHICH IS THE COMMUNIST SYMBOL.

33:23.868 --> 33:24.535
>> THERE'S OTHER THINGS IN HERE,

33:24.602 --> 33:25.603
LIKE HE WAS HOLDING A BABY AT A

33:25.670 --> 33:27.038
CHRISTENING.

33:27.105 --> 33:27.839
AND THEN I PUT LENIN'S HEAD ON

33:27.905 --> 33:28.940
TOP OF IT.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.308
>> John: WOW, THAT IS PETTY.

33:30.375 --> 33:35.213
HONESTLY, IF I WERE TIM, I'D

33:35.279 --> 33:36.447
BACK OFF AT THIS POINT.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.548
BECAUSE IF THIS MAN MADE A

33:37.615 --> 33:38.216
COMMUNIST DUCK OUT OF YOUR

33:38.282 --> 33:38.950
PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHS, JUST THINK

33:39.016 --> 33:39.484
WHAT ELSE HE'S CAPABLE OF.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.052
"HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, TIM!

33:41.119 --> 33:42.120
THE FEATHERS ARE MADE OUT OF

33:42.186 --> 33:43.521
BANK STATEMENTS I FISHED FROM

33:43.588 --> 33:44.622
YOUR TRASH, AND THE BEAK IS FROM

33:44.689 --> 33:45.556
A PHOTO OF YOU I TOOK WHILE YOU

33:45.623 --> 33:46.424
WERE SLEEPING.

33:46.491 --> 33:50.695
BUT BY ALL MEANS, KEEP TALKING

33:50.762 --> 33:52.130
SHIT."

33:52.196 --> 33:53.598
THE POINT HERE IS, THE DUCK

33:53.664 --> 33:54.465
STAMP COMPETITION IS INTENSE.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.867
LAST YEAR, THERE WERE SOME

33:55.933 --> 33:56.567
INCREDIBLE ENTRIES, LIKE THIS

33:56.634 --> 33:57.635
ONE OF A DUCK SOMEHOW TRIPPING

33:57.702 --> 34:02.807
IN MIDAIR, AND THIS ONE, WHICH

34:02.874 --> 34:05.309
I WOULD ARGUE IS ACTUALLY

34:05.376 --> 34:05.610
A DOG STAMP.

34:05.676 --> 34:06.344
A DOG ON HIS WAY TO

34:06.411 --> 34:06.878
A LEATHER BAR WHILE A DUCK

34:06.944 --> 34:07.378
HAPPENED TO BE PASSING.

34:07.445 --> 34:07.879
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS A

34:07.945 --> 34:08.746
CRITICISM.

34:08.813 --> 34:09.547
I'M JUST SAYING, THAT'S WHAT IT

34:09.614 --> 34:12.417
IS.

34:12.483 --> 34:13.751
BUT THE OVERALL WINNER WAS THIS

34:13.818 --> 34:14.285
OBJECTIVELY WONDERFUL, VERY

34:14.352 --> 34:15.086
ANATOMICALLY ACCURATE PAINTING

34:15.153 --> 34:16.154
OF A LESSER SCAUP DRAKE BY

34:16.220 --> 34:17.822
ARTIST RICHARD CLIFTON.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.623
AND HIDING THE DUCK'S COIL-Y

34:18.689 --> 34:19.424
DICK UNDERWATER WAS A VERY SMART

34:19.490 --> 34:20.858
MOVIE, RICHIE.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.527
YOU CAN'T SEE IT, BUT YOU KNOW

34:22.593 --> 34:29.534
IT'S DOWN THERE SWIRLING AWAY.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.635
QUICK FUN SIDE NOTE: THAT

34:30.701 --> 34:31.869
DUCK CALL IN THE CORNER IS ONLY

34:31.936 --> 34:32.804
THERE BECAUSE, UNDER THE TRUMP

34:32.870 --> 34:33.471
ADMINISTRATION, THERE WAS

34:33.538 --> 34:34.605
SUDDENLY A RULE THAT ALL ENTRIES

34:34.672 --> 34:35.940
HAD TO FEATURE HUNTING IMAGERY,

34:36.007 --> 34:42.613
WHICH MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.917
THANKFULLY, THAT RULE WILL BE

34:45.983 --> 34:46.751
GONE NEXT YEAR, WHICH IS GOOD,

34:46.818 --> 34:47.652
BECAUSE POTENTIALLY DRIVING

34:47.718 --> 34:48.920
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DUCK STAMP

34:48.986 --> 34:49.654
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.388
STAMP SALES ARE ALREADY DOWN,

34:50.455 --> 34:51.155
AND AS YOU NOW KNOW, THAT MEANS

34:51.222 --> 34:52.457
LESS MONEY FOR CONSERVATION.

34:52.523 --> 34:53.624
WHAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS

34:53.691 --> 34:54.892
FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE DRIVEN TO

34:54.959 --> 34:57.695
COLLECTING THESE THINGS.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.597
AND FOR THAT TO WORK, YOU REALLY

34:59.664 --> 35:00.231
NEED THIS YEAR'S WINNER TO BE AN

35:00.298 --> 35:04.001
ABSOLUTE DOOZY.

35:04.068 --> 35:04.936
AND THAT IS WHERE WE COME IN.

35:05.002 --> 35:05.570
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, ANYONE CAN

35:05.636 --> 35:07.104
ENTER THIS CONTEST.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.307
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT,

35:09.373 --> 35:13.878
THIS YEAR, THIS ANYONE DID.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.713
WE COMMISSIONED A PAINTER TO

35:15.780 --> 35:18.282
CREATE THIS GORGEOUS OIL

35:18.349 --> 35:19.484
PAINTING OF A BLUE-WINGED TEAL

35:19.550 --> 35:21.886
FLYING IN THE NINTENDO GAME

35:21.953 --> 35:28.059
"DUCK HUNT," MEETING THEIR

35:28.125 --> 35:30.928
RIDICULOUS HUNTING REQUIREMENT.

35:30.995 --> 35:31.496
THIS IS A REAL PAINTING THAT

35:31.562 --> 35:32.964
TOOK MONTHS OF WORK.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.599
BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY, IT WAS

35:34.665 --> 35:35.633
DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE OF, AND I

35:35.700 --> 35:36.601
QUOTE, "THE RULE AGAINST HAVING

35:36.667 --> 35:37.268
ANY NUMBERS OR LETTERING ON THE

35:37.335 --> 35:37.635
ENTRY."

35:37.702 --> 35:39.003
WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS

35:39.070 --> 35:40.505
REQUIREMENT.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.839
IT'S LIKE IF THEY SAID, "NO DUCK

35:41.906 --> 35:46.644
STAMP IS ALLOWED TO FEATURE CANS

35:46.711 --> 35:48.913
OF SPAGHETTIOS OR PAUL SORVINO."

35:48.980 --> 35:50.281
WHAT HAPPENED IN PAST CONTESTS

35:50.348 --> 35:53.718
THAT PROMPTED THAT REGULATION?

35:53.784 --> 35:54.752
SO THAT IS THE BAD NEWS.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.353
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE ACTUALLY

35:55.419 --> 35:57.054
HAD A SECOND ENTRY.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.891
SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAINTING OF

35:59.957 --> 36:00.525
DUCKS JUDGING THE DUCK STAMP ART

36:00.591 --> 36:01.959
CONTEST.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.594
UNFORTUNATELY, WE FELL VICTIM TO

36:03.661 --> 36:06.430
THE SAME BULLSHIT NUMBER RULE,

36:06.497 --> 36:10.535
AND THIS WAS DISQUALIFIED TOO.

36:10.601 --> 36:13.104
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE JUST

36:13.170 --> 36:13.738
HOW RELIEVED WE WERE TO SUDDENLY

36:13.804 --> 36:15.239
REMEMBER THAT WE'D ACTUALLY

36:15.306 --> 36:16.474
ENTERED THREE OTHER PAINTINGS,

36:16.541 --> 36:18.543
ALL OF WHICH, I'M HAPPY TO SAY,

36:18.609 --> 36:19.176
DID QUALIFY FOR THIS WEEKEND'S

36:19.243 --> 36:23.180
CONTEST.

36:23.247 --> 36:24.315
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.

36:24.382 --> 36:24.882
FIRST, THERE'S THIS ONE OF A

36:24.949 --> 36:25.950
REDHEAD DUCK HUNTING A HUNTER

36:26.017 --> 36:27.852
HUNTING ANOTHER DUCK.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.320
HOLD THE OMINOUS, QUIETLY

36:29.387 --> 36:30.788
MANIACAL LOOK IN THAT DUCK'S EYE

36:30.855 --> 36:32.623
AS HE'S ABOUT TO PULL THE

36:32.690 --> 36:32.990
TRIGGER.

36:33.057 --> 36:34.292
IT'S A HAUNTING YET TRIUMPHANT

36:34.358 --> 36:36.594
IMAGE.

36:36.661 --> 36:37.662
SO LET'S SEE IF THE DUCK STAMP

36:37.728 --> 36:38.162
JUDGES LIKED IT:

36:38.229 --> 36:41.699
>> PLEASE VOTE.

36:41.766 --> 36:42.967
>> IT'S OUT.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.403
>> John: ARE YOU FUCKING

36:45.469 --> 36:46.404
KIDDING ME?

36:46.470 --> 36:47.138
NOT ONE OF YOU JUDGES VOTED FOR

36:47.204 --> 36:53.844
THAT?

36:53.911 --> 36:54.445
RIDICULOUS.

36:54.512 --> 36:55.513
JUST RIDICULOUS.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.447
ALL FIVE OF YOU SHOULD BE

36:56.514 --> 36:56.914
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

36:56.981 --> 36:57.315
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.317
FINE.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.418
BECAUSE REMEMBER, WE STILL HAD

37:00.484 --> 37:00.718
TWO OTHERS.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.253
NEXT UP WAS THIS ENTRY,

37:02.320 --> 37:05.122
"DUCK WITH A PEARL EARRING."

37:05.189 --> 37:05.723
WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS

37:05.790 --> 37:06.057
EXQUISITE.

37:06.123 --> 37:12.096
IT MAKES THE ORIGINAL VERMEER

37:12.163 --> 37:13.297
LOOK LIKE A COMPLETE PILE OF

37:13.364 --> 37:13.598
SHIT.

37:13.664 --> 37:14.899
THAT GIRL DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY

37:14.966 --> 37:16.767
FEATHERS.

37:16.834 --> 37:18.402
OR A BEAK FOR THAT MATTER.

37:18.469 --> 37:18.869
WHAT A WASTE OF PAINT.

37:18.936 --> 37:19.470
SO SURELY, SURELY, THE JUDGES

37:19.537 --> 37:20.638
LOVED THIS ONE.

37:20.705 --> 37:22.607
>> PLEASE VOTE.

37:22.673 --> 37:26.944
IT'S OUT.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.879
>> John: OH, COME ON!

37:28.946 --> 37:29.513
THESE JUDGES ARE FUCKING CLOWNS.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.781
THEY DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT ART,

37:30.848 --> 37:31.315
THEY DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT

37:31.382 --> 37:32.283
DUCKS, AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T

37:32.350 --> 37:35.553
KNOW SHIT ABOUT DUCK ART.

37:35.620 --> 37:39.390
AND, LOOK, I'M NOT ALONE IN

37:39.457 --> 37:40.324
BEING SHOCKED BY THIS.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.694
THE PEOPLE WATCHING THE

37:43.761 --> 37:44.295
CONTEST'S LIVESTREAM WERE VERY

37:44.362 --> 37:45.129
INTO THIS ENTRY, WRITING

37:45.196 --> 37:45.663
"GORGEOUS.

37:45.730 --> 37:46.430
PERFECT.

37:46.497 --> 37:47.231

37:47.298 --> 37:48.466

37:48.532 --> 37:49.100
AND "I WANT THAT ON MY WALL."

37:49.166 --> 37:50.101
AND OF COURSE THEY DO.

37:50.167 --> 37:55.606
WHAT CULTURED DUCK ART LOVER

37:55.673 --> 37:56.407
WOULD NOT WANT THAT?

37:56.474 --> 37:57.208
SO AT THIS POINT, WE WERE

37:57.274 --> 37:57.708
GETTING A BIT NERVOUS.

37:57.775 --> 37:58.442
LUCKILY, OUR FINAL PAINTING WAS

37:58.509 --> 37:59.243
GUARANTEED TO BLOW EVERYONE

37:59.310 --> 38:01.779

38:03.381 --> 38:03.948
