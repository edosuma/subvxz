WEBVTT

00:02.253 --> 00:04.547
that Feathered Serpent 2
will launch tomorrow.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.590
The world will be better because of it.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.760
[Alex] I first saw Yassen at school
and now he's following me.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.804
What happened to your uncle
was unfortunate.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.848
[Alex] Who killed him?
Is it Yassen Gregorovitch?

00:14.598 --> 00:16.517
Tell me about Yassen.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.394
They call themselves SCORPIA.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.187
Blunt thinks they're planning
an assassination.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.772
Of the president?

00:21.856 --> 00:24.442
-May we have access to your roof?
-What are you worried about? Sniper?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.778
Between the president leaving the car
and entering the building,

00:27.862 --> 00:29.572
that could be maybe five or six seconds.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.908
It's an awkward shot but you could do it.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.662
Hello, Alex.
You have something that's mine.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.998
-You mean this?
-[Cray] Exactly.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.416
I'd like it back, please.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.168
That's not gonna happen.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.337
I took something
that I think is important to you.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.923
Follow the instructions
and bring me what's mine,

00:48.007 --> 00:50.718
and you and Sabina here...

00:50.801 --> 00:53.012
will live to see tomorrow.

00:53.095 --> 00:56.098
-[ominous music playing]
-[alarm blares]

01:14.909 --> 01:16.702
Give me your phone, please.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.705
Thank you.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.711
Arms. Legs.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.633
-Let's go inside.
-No.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.806
Did you kill my uncle?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.184
Yes. I killed him.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.145
Why?

01:43.229 --> 01:44.647
He made a mistake.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.067
He trusted the people he worked with.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.405
Come on. Inside.

02:00.830 --> 02:04.208
[alarm blaring]

02:04.291 --> 02:07.503
[indistinct chatter]

02:07.586 --> 02:09.547
[Yassen] You, take him. Over there.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.007
-[soldier] Yes, sir.
-[Alex] Sabina.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.810
Got what you wanted?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.020
Yes, I have.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.898
What is it?

02:28.691 --> 02:30.609
[Cray] President Walker's thumbprint.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.282
[ominous music playing]

02:36.365 --> 02:38.576
I got everything I need.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.286
[Alex] It's gonna be okay.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.996
So we can go?

02:43.455 --> 02:44.874
Of course not.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.625
Kill them both.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.504
[theme music playing]

02:50.588 --> 02:53.048
[singer]

03:33.631 --> 03:34.715
No.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.723
What?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.310
It's a mistake.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.229
They are hostages.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.398
Ideal hostages.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.733
They're just kids.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.109
They're not relevant.

03:55.778 --> 03:56.946
This one...

03:57.780 --> 03:59.406
works for the British government.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.284
In fact, he works for Alan Blunt.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.915
You've hired your mercenaries.
You've made your plans.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.251
But things don't always go as you expect.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.713
And then hostages can be very useful.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.107
If Blunt knew that you were here,

04:33.190 --> 04:36.193
this place would be crawling
with CIA and MI6.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.904
You're on your own.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.825
Lock them up.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.870
[grunts]

04:49.456 --> 04:51.125
Look at this subroutine.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.545
Look how the call-backs are structured.
Why is it like that?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.213
Actually, I think we start
with who the hell are you

04:56.296 --> 04:57.881
and what the hell
are you doing in my chair?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.009
Kyra. Code.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.555
Kyra Vichenko-Chao?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.433
Didn't you escape
from a Department safe house?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.810
The food was very bad.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.687
-And you're here why?
-[Jones] I brought her here.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.608
Alex discovered Cray's game code
at the facility in Amsterdam.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.403
He said there's something dangerous in it.
I need to find out what.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.864
Are we saying Damian Cray is a threat?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.033
The president is about
to arrive at his house.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.451
I know. I'm on it.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.377
What the hell is this?

05:36.045 --> 05:37.463
Yeah.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.714
Exactly.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.343
I thought you'd want me dead.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.636
Like I said.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.096
You're more use this way.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.431
For the moment.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.099
You work for Cray now?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.310
Do what he tells you?

05:54.855 --> 05:55.981
Like a dog.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.235
Is that all SCORPIA are? Dogs for hire?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.738
You're trying to create an opportunity.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.073
Make me angry.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.949
Make me careless.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.827
Those things don't happen with me.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.621
Then how did you get the scar?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.459
Be quiet now.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.673
[door opens, then closes]

06:21.757 --> 06:23.759
[chains rattle, then lock clicks]

06:23.842 --> 06:25.969
[Sabina] Cray is right, isn't he?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.139
No one's coming.
We're on our own.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.519
Alex, what is this all about?
What is he gonna do?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.687
I don't know.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.942
But I heard him say
a million people are gonna die.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.154
A million people
to save a hundred million.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.825
What? Tell me you have a plan.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.495
I'm working on it.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.502
[ominous music playing]

06:59.795 --> 07:01.713
-[Byrne] How are we?
-Perimeter's secure.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.591
Airspace is cleared.
Building and grounds have been swept.

07:04.675 --> 07:05.926
We're good to go.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.719
The president's about to arrive.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.263
What about Mr. Cray?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.682
We've had a message.
He's been unavoidably detained.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.350
Something to do with the game launch.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.060
[Byrne] I have two agents guarding him.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.437
He may be late but he will be safe.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.608
[Crawley] Sniper units, stay alert.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.402
The president is arriving now.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.030
[agent] Echo 1, we are in position.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.241
Perimeter is secure.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.827
This is Overwatch, we are clear.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.246
Eagle is secure.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.876
President's inside. Front access is clear.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.294
Secure the gates.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.755
Come on, let's move.
I'm on a schedule here.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.132
Bring the girl.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.176
-Thought you had a party to go to.
-[Cray] I do.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.595
In fact, President Walker
should be arriving right now.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.221
What are you doing with her?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.057
In case you try anything stupid.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.767
[door locks]

07:57.477 --> 07:59.730
-[Jones] Where's Cray?
-Running late, apparently.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.190
Do we have agents on him?

08:01.273 --> 08:03.483
Yeah. Two.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.819
-Checking in every hour.
-Call them.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.199
Get me Cray's detail.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.121
[agent] Comm check negative.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.291
We've lost touch with them.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.336
[suspenseful music playing]

08:26.298 --> 08:28.133
[indistinct chatter]

08:33.931 --> 08:35.807
[grunting]

08:51.073 --> 08:53.033
[Cray] Let's move, people.
Come on, let's go!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.499
[soldier] Go, go, go. Move!

09:01.541 --> 09:02.793
Let's go, get your bags!

09:13.053 --> 09:14.471
You updated the drone's firmware?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.139
It will appear to air traffic control

09:16.223 --> 09:18.100
as a military plane
with a valid flight plan.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.269
[Cray] And they'll believe
whatever we tell them.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.939
Let's move out.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.447
[suspenseful music playing]

09:40.789 --> 09:43.792
[engine revving]

10:17.534 --> 10:18.577
[grunts]

10:44.519 --> 10:46.355
Cray's gone missing en route.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.148
His security detail's unresponsive.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.733
It's worse than that.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.235
I believe Cray was behind
Smoking Mirror's attempt

10:52.319 --> 10:53.320
to hack the Pentagon.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.323
I also have a report
that he killed a man in cold blood.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.075
Where did you get this information?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.494
Excuse us.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.580
[tense music playing]

11:08.752 --> 11:10.003
[Jones sighs]

11:10.087 --> 11:11.254
Alex Rider?

11:12.214 --> 11:13.882
Yes. The intel is good.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.301
-What's your proof?
-Smithers is working on it.

11:16.385 --> 11:17.803
Working on it's not enough.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.847
-Well, he was right about Gregorovitch.
-Who he led to Smoking Mirror.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.392
He destroyed our lead.
He destroyed the entire operation.

11:23.475 --> 11:27.062
Just for a moment, let's consider
the possibility that Cray is a murderer

11:27.145 --> 11:29.356
and his game is some kind of Trojan horse.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.400
What if the danger isn't to Cray,

11:31.483 --> 11:32.943
it's from Cray?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.903
Trust your agent.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.072
The agent is psychologically unsound.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.158
-Why do you keep saying this?
-Because of his psych evaluation.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.077
Yes, with Dr. Lambert, who I recommended.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.453
As I hoped you would.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.997
-How dare you.
-You really think

11:46.081 --> 11:48.875
I was gonna let Alex Rider
walk away from this without oversight?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.752
Alex Rider does not run this department.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.003
[Jones] No, he does not.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.172
But it's not just Alex
you don't trust, is it?

11:54.256 --> 11:57.551
You don't trust me.
You don't trust anyone. Yourself.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.094
Drop this. Now.

11:59.177 --> 12:02.389
[footsteps approaching]

12:03.473 --> 12:05.851
-Are we good?
-Yes, we're fine.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.520
[Jones] No. We're not.
Cray is the threat, not SCORPIA.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.480
Get the president out of here right now.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.484
[cell phone beeping]

12:15.652 --> 12:17.946
Security black. Crash, crash, crash.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.408
The agents we put on Cray are dead.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.784
Cray's vanished.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.704
[agent 1] Code black.
Evacuate the president immediately.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.205
[indistinct radio chatter]

12:27.289 --> 12:28.540
[dramatic music playing]

12:28.623 --> 12:30.000
[agent 2] Go, go, go.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.293
Copy that.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.598
[ominous music playing]

12:46.558 --> 12:47.601
Alex?

12:55.317 --> 12:56.693
Anybody home?

13:05.327 --> 13:08.330
[cell phone buzzing]

13:32.979 --> 13:34.397
[door opens]

13:34.481 --> 13:36.149
[Jack] Alex?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.776
Hey, Tom.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.153
Where's Alex?

13:40.237 --> 13:41.655
Not here.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.534
Jack, I think he might be in trouble.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.620
[dramatic music playing]

14:13.019 --> 14:14.020
Deploy the drone.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.230
[soldier] Yes, sir.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.363
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:40.547 --> 14:41.631
We're set.

14:42.424 --> 14:45.844
[Cray] Set transponder
to emergency code 7700.

14:47.262 --> 14:51.016
Drone will appear
as aircraft Lockheed-Martin C130.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.103
Unit control, deploy.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.689
[beeping]

15:03.653 --> 15:06.156
[man] Tango Seven Delta,
this is Calfield tower.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.074
You are squawking 7700.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.119
-What is your emergency?
-[Cray] Mayday, mayday, Calfield tower.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.455
We have an engine fire
and suppression has failed.

15:13.538 --> 15:17.584
I repeat, we have an engine fire
and we are losing altitude.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.085
Roger, Tango Seven Delta.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.796
The runway is clear for emergency landing.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.633
[Cray] Be advised, Calfield,
we are carrying hazardous cargo.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.843
Say again, Tango Seven Delta?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.553
[Cray] We are carrying nerve gas.

15:28.637 --> 15:32.599
I repeat, we are carrying
thiophosphonate nerve gas, 15 liters.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.226
You need to evacuate the area now.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.063
I repeat,
evacuate the airbase of all personnel.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.065
How much time do we have
until game launch?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.943
Uh, six minutes.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.657
This is all I/O protocols. All of it.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.200
I know.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.826
Mine, too.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.620
Why does it need so much?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.580
What eats so much throughput?

15:55.664 --> 15:59.209
Data transfer? Shared processing?
Like node processors?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.378
Yes. Clever.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.879
You should come work for us one day.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.340
-You don't pay enough to hire me.
-You're telling me.

16:06.424 --> 16:10.220
So millions of computers,
all in parallel, all in sync,

16:10.303 --> 16:13.264
-which basically gives us a...
-Supercomputer.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.850
When the game launches,
all the players' machines will link up

16:15.934 --> 16:17.602
and create a supercomputer.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.272
-What the hell do they need that for?
-[cell phone ringing]

16:22.649 --> 16:23.983
Kind of busy here.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.276
Alex is missing.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.820
What? You lost him?

16:26.903 --> 16:28.279
[Tom] No. Something's wrong.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.989
I think Cray got to him somehow.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.200
Listen, he's taken one of Blunt's bugs.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.077
Like this time, he wants them to find him.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.037
Okay. I got it. Trust me.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.622
Yeah, I do.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.418
Problem.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.880
Chemical Response Unit, go ahead.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.007
[officer]
Chemical Response, this is Calfield.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.301
We have an inbound plane
with hazmat cargo.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.178
Potential nerve gas spill.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.889
Scramble your team.
Say again, scramble.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.100
Understood, Calfield. On our way.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.731
Okay, visors on.

17:03.815 --> 17:04.941
The airbase is ours.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.777
By the time they realize
there's no crash, it'll be over.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.864
[ominous music playing]

17:20.790 --> 17:24.210
One million people
to save a hundred million.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.087
That's the plan, right?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.800
It's 1.14 million projected

17:30.884 --> 17:34.888
across Colombia, Peru,
Afghanistan, the Golden Triangle.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.182
Most in the rural areas, of course.

17:37.265 --> 17:41.561
So based on our current estimates
of dispersal of the fallout,

17:41.644 --> 17:43.938
-it's only 1.14.
-[Sabina] Fallout?

17:44.647 --> 17:46.566
Like nuclear fallout?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.736
You're gonna start a war?

17:49.819 --> 17:50.820
No.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.781
We're gonna end one.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.325
Let's go.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.831
[beeping]

18:06.419 --> 18:09.047
[alarm blaring]

18:12.926 --> 18:14.677
[guard] It's Chemical Response.
Open the gate.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.965
[Cray] I need the whole airbase emptied!

18:52.048 --> 18:54.634
Is everyone off the plane?
Has it been evacuated?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.177
-Yes, sir.
-[Cray] Good.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.683
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:07.814 --> 19:10.149
You two, guard the entrance.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.318
-No one else gets onboard.
-[soldier] Yes, sir.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.237
[Cray] You, check the perimeter.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.989
Make sure we're alone.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.955
[suspenseful music playing]

19:31.546 --> 19:32.797
Keep her out of the way.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.041
-Come on. Come on.
-[scanner beeping]

20:12.295 --> 20:13.504
Let's go.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.264
Let's get going.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.103
Get ready.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.817
[suspenseful music playing]

20:34.901 --> 20:37.904
[indistinct radio chatter]

21:01.469 --> 21:02.971
[Kyra] Have you found him?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.931
[Smithers] It's taking a while
to get the tracers back online.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.225
-Give me a moment here.
-We may not have a moment.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.310
[computer beeping]

21:09.394 --> 21:11.437
Is there no way to stop
this game from launching?

21:11.521 --> 21:15.024
Maybe if I could breach the servers.
But I've never seen firewalls this good.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.997
[beeping]

21:30.999 --> 21:32.291
We're out of time.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.483

-Ramping up.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.360
One hundred million players connected.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.696
[computer beeping]

22:02.363 --> 22:05.450
They're linking up. 200 million players.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.285
And there it is. Critical coverage.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.372
We're stable. We did it.
The world's largest supercomputer.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.166
Good. Well done.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.918
Start the hack.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.462
Wait. Say again.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.505
Look, the game is not a game.
It's a supercomputer.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.759
It links up millions of machines,
anyone playing becomes a node.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.011
Cray can hack any system on the planet.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.637
To do what?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.723
Find Alex
and I'm betting we find our answer.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.100
Luckily, he took
one of our tracers with him.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.978
I'm gonna relay his location to you
the moment I have it.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.106
-Hey.
-Got something.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.483
Stand by.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.193
Which one is Alex?

22:43.237 --> 22:45.865
Crash the Internet.
Crash telecom satellites.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.409
Let's get some fear
and uncertainty going, shall we?

22:53.081 --> 22:54.290
The system's glitching.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.795
Internet's crashing.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.256
-Which site?
-All of it.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.553
Hello? Hello?

23:08.346 --> 23:09.347
[computer beeps]

23:09.430 --> 23:11.265
I have Pentagon access.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.393
-Did they see it?
-No. We were too fast.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.188
Good. Get me those nuclear codes.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.108
Phones are dead.

23:20.191 --> 23:21.984
So is e-mail, so is text.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.947
Cray cut us off.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.824
Where is Alex?

23:27.907 --> 23:31.244
The tracers are on a closed system.
Proprietary GPS.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.995
[computer chiming]

23:33.079 --> 23:35.248
They're all in Central London except...

23:36.999 --> 23:39.252
-...that one.
-Then that's him. Where is he?

23:40.253 --> 23:42.130
[Smithers] 25 miles away.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.589
Calfield Airbase.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.467
Air Force One.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.391
[suspenseful music playing]

24:23.296 --> 24:25.423
You need to get out of here.
There's a way out. I can show you.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.800
-Don't be stupid.
-It's not safe.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.802
-No way.
-I am not letting you get hurt.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.804
And I am not leaving you. Understand?

24:32.513 --> 24:35.016
What did Cray mean by ending a war?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.645
The war on drugs.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.190
Cray's brother died of drugs overdose.

24:42.273 --> 24:46.402
Afghanistan, the Golden Triangle,
they're all drug-growing areas.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.989
This is Air Force One,
it's a mobile military war room.

24:50.072 --> 24:53.826
Once Cray's got the nuclear codes,
he can launch America's missiles

24:53.910 --> 24:57.622
and just... burn the problem
off the face of the earth.

24:59.081 --> 25:03.044
[Evelyn] I have them. NSA daily issue
nuclear launch, onetime pad.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.379

Uh, number four.

25:07.548 --> 25:08.549

25:17.391 --> 25:18.476

26:10.861 --> 26:14.031
Uh, Cray, that woman that works for him.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.450
Guards, I think.
And the man with the scar.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.535
Gregorovitch.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.621
I'm not getting past him.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.417
Maybe not on your own.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.817
What exactly is...?

26:50.484 --> 26:52.153
Shortwave radio.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.407
Analog just sounds better,
don't you think?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.701
Hello?

27:17.345 --> 27:20.306
That's the old War Department

27:20.389 --> 27:22.516
Shortwave. Change frequency.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.478
Got it.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.855
[Smithers] This is Department Ops
transmitting in the blind.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.691
Make your location Charlie, Lima, Foxtrot.

27:30.775 --> 27:33.694
I repeat, Charlie, Lima, Foxtrot.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.446
Be advised.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.073
Agent in the field.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.991
CLF? What's that?

27:39.075 --> 27:41.202
It's the identifier code
for Calfield Airbase.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.828
It's the plane.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.289
-It's Air Force One.
-What?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.458
That's why Cray needs the supercomputer.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.752
Hack the Pentagon, get the launch codes.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.506
Take Air Force One,
you have the platform to use them.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.716
[Jones]
The president was never the target.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.760
The assassination was a diversion.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.679
Cray wants the nuclear codes.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.015
He wants the missiles.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.854
[Evelyn] We're ready.

Madam President, this is General Lomis
at the Pentagon, I read you.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.266
General, we are under attack

28:45.349 --> 28:48.602
and that attack includes
our communications satellites.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.815
I am authorizing a nuclear response.

Why would I kill you?

Your father...

32:49.551 --> 32:50.678
Your father was...

32:51.887 --> 32:53.347
He was my friend.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.446
Listen to me.

If you want to know the truth...

We're too late.

-Hello?
-Launch order confirmed.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.787
No. You have got to cancel it.
It's not true.

Who is this?

34:02.583 --> 34:03.625
Clear this channel.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.252
The president is not here.

That's the code, right?

34:17.097 --> 34:19.850
I've got it right here.
And if I've got it, anyone can have it.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.811
You got hacked.
Damian Cray stole the codes.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.647
This isn't a war.
It's a personal vendetta.

Check your targets.

A million innocent people are gonna die.
Please. You have to believe me.

34:31.695 --> 34:34.490
The president gave me that order.
Not Damian Cray.

I saw her with my own eyes.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.367

34:41.038 --> 34:43.791
I'm the president of the United States
and I'm telling you,

34:43.874 --> 34:46.126
you're making a mistake.

34:47.961 --> 34:50.589
All stations, this is General Lomis, NMCC.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.634
On my authority, abort, abort, abort!

35:03.727 --> 35:05.395
Stand down and await further instructions.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.773
[guard] General, I have MI6 on the line.

35:19.701 --> 35:20.744
[agent] Hands!

35:22.996 --> 35:25.624
Hands! Put your hands
where I can see them!

35:25.707 --> 35:27.626
We're the good guys.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.710
You want...

35:58.824 --> 36:00.117
What happened?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.911
Cray tried to launch a nuclear strike.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.580
Gregorovitch shot him.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.832
Gregorovitch? Where is he now?

36:08.709 --> 36:10.085
[Alex] He escaped, but...

36:10.961 --> 36:12.379
He saved my life.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.215
Why would he do that?

36:16.258 --> 36:17.259
I don't know.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.845
Did he say anything to you?

36:24.474 --> 36:26.935
-Nothing.
-Nothing at all?

36:28.937 --> 36:30.147
Nothing at all.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.783
[Byrne] We're blaming Cray's death
on a cartel hit.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.077
The president's issuing a statement.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.330
Personal friend, deeply regrets.

36:46.413 --> 36:49.791
A legacy that will continue to do good
around the world, so on and so on.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.544
Privately, of course
she's asking questions

36:52.628 --> 36:56.048
and honestly,
I'm at a loss as to what to say to her.

36:56.131 --> 37:00.344
Oh, tell her it was a valuable
learning experience.

37:00.427 --> 37:05.390
And now you know your weaknesses
and you can fix them and...

37:06.141 --> 37:07.476
...turn them into strengths.

37:08.769 --> 37:09.937
And which were you?

37:11.939 --> 37:13.482
A weakness, or a strength?

37:15.275 --> 37:16.985
You lied to me, Alan.

37:18.195 --> 37:22.074
About SCORPIA, about your agent.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.626
We won, didn't we?

37:40.467 --> 37:42.344
Americans are happy.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.929
I very much doubt that.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.515
We prevented a nuclear war,
and more importantly,

37:46.598 --> 37:49.643
we prevented a catastrophic loss of face
for the U.S. government.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.728
We did that, or Alex did that?

37:54.106 --> 37:57.818
-Listen!
-I know we lie, I know we use people.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.362
But the way you treated Alex
crosses the line.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.448
Now, you may be able to spin this
with the CIA and the Ministry,

38:03.532 --> 38:06.076
but right here, right now,
we both know it.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.293
Sabina.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.629
Alex.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.714
Hey.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.801
How's your dad?

38:23.593 --> 38:25.679
They say he's gonna be okay.

38:25.762 --> 38:29.099
That's great. That's amazing.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.477
Um, they said he needs to stay calm.

38:32.561 --> 38:35.063
You know, no shocks or surprises.

38:36.690 --> 38:37.691
Ah.

38:38.775 --> 38:41.945
Maybe best if I don't
come around for a while then.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.951
I like you, Alex.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.328
I really do.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.081
It's okay.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.418
I get it.

39:09.473 --> 39:10.474
See you around.

39:11.558 --> 39:12.559
Yeah.

39:13.643 --> 39:14.644
You, too.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.660
[Alex whispering indistinctly]

39:35.040 --> 39:36.166
[cell phone buzzes]

39:40.128 --> 39:43.131
[pensive music playing]

39:49.137 --> 39:50.138
We're on.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.977
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.021
The day is hot; the Capulets, abroad.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.565
And if we meet
we shall not escape a brawl.

40:00.649 --> 40:04.111
For now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.788
Thou art like one of those fellows that,

40:14.871 --> 40:19.167
when he enters the confines of a tavern,
claps me on the head with a sword...

40:23.171 --> 40:24.631
[dramatic music playing]

40:33.890 --> 40:36.226
-Jack?
-[Jack] How did it go?

40:36.977 --> 40:38.562
May have scraped a pass.

40:38.645 --> 40:42.315
Bollocks, he stole the show.
Funniest Mercutio ever.

40:42.399 --> 40:43.650
You have a visitor.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.822
I have something for you.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.577
It's not really the thank you
you deserve, but...

40:55.954 --> 40:56.955
What's it for?

40:58.039 --> 41:00.333
Some friends at the CIA helped us out.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.216
No more visas.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.094
No more threats to deport you.

41:12.888 --> 41:14.181
No strings attached.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.185
Jack.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.524
These are guardianship papers,

41:24.608 --> 41:26.776
in my name.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.528
And citizenship.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.616
Dual citizenship.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.411
We let you down, Alex.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.040
I let you down.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.168
And I'm sorry.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.463
And Blunt?

41:48.798 --> 41:51.051
Blunt doesn't really do apologies.

41:53.845 --> 41:54.971
I'll see you around.

41:57.432 --> 41:58.516
Tom.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.601
Mrs. Jones.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.356
[Jack] I can't believe this.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.359
I'm your legal guardian.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.319
It's official.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.031
We're family.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.033
Well, we have to celebrate.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.409
Uh...

42:16.493 --> 42:17.577
Pizza?

42:17.661 --> 42:20.956
Oh! Think bigger than pizza, man.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.207
[Jack] Tom's right.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.418
You know, I was thinking,
we tried that holiday in Cornwall,

42:25.502 --> 42:26.795
and it was an epic fail.

42:26.878 --> 42:30.215
Oh, I'm down to try again,
but no tents this time, okay?

42:30.298 --> 42:31.967
No tents. Promise.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.594
You know what? It's your call.

42:34.678 --> 42:36.888
Where do you guys wanna go?

42:40.225 --> 42:43.728
If you want to know the truth...

42:44.813 --> 42:47.023
go to find the widow...

42:49.234 --> 42:50.527
Find SCORPIA.

42:51.569 --> 42:56.366
If you want to know who you really are.

42:56.449 --> 42:57.450
I have an idea.

42:58.952 --> 43:01.246
[theme music playing]

43:01.329 --> 43:03.832
[singer]
