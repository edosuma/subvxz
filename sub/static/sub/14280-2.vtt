11:17.412 --> 11:20.415
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Now, that was scary,

11:20.449 --> 11:24.019
Good thing it wasn't real,
Or was it?!

11:24.053 --> 11:26.756
Nah, it wasn't,
But maybe it was!

11:26.789 --> 11:29.925
Nah, nah, just kidding around,
It wasn't!

11:29.959 --> 11:31.426
[exhales sharply]

11:31.460 --> 11:33.663
How do I get these teeth out?

11:47.409 --> 11:50.713
[mid‐tempo music plays]

11:50.746 --> 11:53.649
[thunder crashes]

11:58.187 --> 12:01.657
[teeth chattering]
No, Chowder, Wait!

12:01.691 --> 12:05.828
You don't know what you're
doing! No!

12:05.861 --> 12:10.800
[Chowder laughs maniacally]

12:12.134 --> 12:14.303
[splurt]

12:14.336 --> 12:17.306
‐ Uh‐oh,
‐ Chowder, what did I say?

12:17.339 --> 12:19.274
You don't know
what you're doing,

12:19.308 --> 12:21.443
You got squish‐squash all over
the place,

12:21.476 --> 12:27.116
The squish‐squash needs
to be squished like so,

12:27.149 --> 12:30.085
[squeaking]

12:30.119 --> 12:34.123
Whoa, Mung!
How do you do that?!

12:34.156 --> 12:35.925
I don't know,
but if you behave yourself,

12:35.958 --> 12:38.427
like a good apprentice,
I will teach it to you, ,,

12:38.460 --> 12:40.095
like I taught it to Shnitzel,

12:40.129 --> 12:43.699
‐ [grunting] ‐ [splurt]

12:45.134 --> 12:47.703
‐ [thunder crashes] ‐ [dinging]

12:47.737 --> 12:50.540
Uh, ,, radda,

12:50.573 --> 12:54.109
And then you
squish the squash‐‐ ohh! Hey!

12:54.143 --> 12:58.347
Shnitzel, we'll play
spatula wars later!
Now get back to work,

12:58.380 --> 13:01.316
Radda! Radda radda radda!

13:01.350 --> 13:04.620
Uh, uh, ,, radda,

13:04.654 --> 13:07.156
‐ So, then you
squash the squishy‐‐

What the‐‐ ohh!

13:10.392 --> 13:13.195
[groggily] Pretty colors, Ohh!

13:13.228 --> 13:16.465
‐ [clang] ‐ [creaking]

13:16.498 --> 13:20.002
Did somebody get the license
plate of that fruit bowl?

13:20.035 --> 13:23.305
Mung? I think you're going to
want to see this,

13:23.338 --> 13:27.476
Sweet thundering cow pies!
What is going on here?!

13:27.510 --> 13:31.046
‐ Mung, I'm scared!
‐ Me too!

13:31.080 --> 13:32.748
Everybody, take cover!

13:32.782 --> 13:35.417
‐ [zip] ‐ Aaaaah!

13:35.450 --> 13:38.721
We'll be safe here until we
figure out what's
causing this,

13:38.754 --> 13:40.723
Whatever it is, I bet it
has nothing to do

13:40.756 --> 13:43.693
with that old, spooky, glowing
thing over there,

13:43.726 --> 13:47.096
That looks like a
dish I cooked years ago,

13:47.129 --> 13:51.433
‐ How did it get back here?
‐ Rad‐radda!
Radda radda radda!

13:51.466 --> 13:53.368
What do you mean, "haunted"?

13:53.402 --> 13:55.938
Ra‐radda radda,
Radda radda radda,

The Snackro‐nomicon?

13:58.373 --> 14:05.114
[surfer voice] Let's make
nachos, buddy!

14:05.147 --> 14:06.882
Oh, Shnitzel!

14:06.916 --> 14:09.251
You and your crazy obsession
with the supernatural,

14:09.284 --> 14:11.687
‐ Radda,
‐ [Mung] A poultrygeist?

14:11.721 --> 14:17.192
You're saying that since this
flurkey dish was never eaten,

14:17.226 --> 14:23.098
left to rot here
behind the radiator,

14:23.132 --> 14:25.968
that it went bad?

14:26.001 --> 14:31.273
So bad that it became, ,, evil?!

14:31.306 --> 14:33.042
‐ [Shnitzel shrieks]
‐ [thunder crashes]

14:33.075 --> 14:35.545
R‐r‐r‐radda?

14:35.578 --> 14:37.379
We must dispose of
this dish at once,

14:37.412 --> 14:40.716
‐ [Chowder grunting]
‐ Chowder! Where's the dish?!

14:40.750 --> 14:45.788
‐ I dunno,
‐ Chowder! What have you done?!

14:45.821 --> 14:48.791
Mung, you said get
rid of the dish, so I ate it!

14:48.824 --> 14:52.394
And now in three days, it'll
return a beautiful butterfly,

14:52.427 --> 14:55.898
‐ And everyone will be happy,
‐ Radda radda,

14:55.931 --> 14:58.601
You're right, Shnitzel,
I guess it was nothing,

14:58.634 --> 15:02.171
So now we can turn our attention
away from Chowder

15:02.204 --> 15:04.574
and blah blah
blah blah blah blah,

15:04.607 --> 15:09.244
‐ [clucking]
‐ Chowder? Are you okay?

15:09.278 --> 15:12.414
‐ [babbling] ‐ [creaking]

15:12.447 --> 15:14.817
[dreamy voice]
I feel fine, Mung,

15:14.850 --> 15:19.021
‐ [thunder crashes]
‐ Oh! R‐radda!

15:19.054 --> 15:20.923
Aaaaah!

15:20.956 --> 15:24.259
Look, I have a tail!
[chuckles] Aaaah!

His head is spinning!
Now his arms!

15:27.563 --> 15:31.934
‐ Ra‐radda!
‐ His feet!
He's doing the bootsie roll!

15:31.967 --> 15:34.937
I haven't seen
that dance in years!

15:34.970 --> 15:38.608
Oh, no! W‐what's that?

15:38.641 --> 15:41.677
‐ Blarga‐flarga,
‐ Now his finger!

15:41.711 --> 15:44.947
Twirling!
This is madness!

15:44.980 --> 15:46.048
Chowder, snap out of it!

15:46.081 --> 15:48.518
[demonic voice]
The Chowder of whom you speak

15:48.551 --> 15:50.820
is no longer here,

15:50.853 --> 15:54.724
‐ Then who are you?
‐ Who am I?

15:54.757 --> 15:58.460
[grunts]
I am known by many names,

15:58.493 --> 16:00.963
I am the foulest
of the barnyard fowl,

16:00.996 --> 16:06.135
roasting in the most
infernal of, ,, uh, um, ,,

16:06.168 --> 16:08.638
most infernal of, ,, infernos!

16:08.671 --> 16:13.475
Blarga‐flarga!
Blarga‐flarga! Ack!

16:13.509 --> 16:17.179
But you can call me Florentine,

16:17.212 --> 16:19.448
Booga booga booga!

16:22.852 --> 16:26.321
Florentine, I know you're upset,
but leave Chowder alone!

16:26.355 --> 16:30.593
‐ [grunting]
‐ He's innocent!
Innocent, I tells ya!

16:30.626 --> 16:34.096
This host body is perfect‐‐ yes,

16:34.129 --> 16:37.066
So round, so fully packed,

16:37.099 --> 16:41.537
It's as though I'm a plump,
juicy flurkey again! Ha ha!

16:41.571 --> 16:43.673
Oh, I could get used to this,

16:43.706 --> 16:46.008
‐ Shnitzel, do something,

16:46.041 --> 16:49.945
‐ Radda radda radda radda!

17:13.302 --> 17:17.206
Mung Daal, long have
I waited for revenge

17:17.239 --> 17:22.144
because you left me to rot
behind the fridge!

17:22.177 --> 17:25.915
Now bear witness to me doing
evil and, ,,

Oh, I'm sorry, Shnitzel,
As I was saying, ,,

17:43.933 --> 17:45.735
we‐‐ we have to stop Florentine,

or we'll lose Chowder forever!

Radda radda radda radda,

No! My cookbooks!

Mung Daal, first I drink your
gravy, then I drink your soul!

18:21.504 --> 18:23.539
Now, Shnitzel, use the book!

18:23.573 --> 18:26.509
Uh, ra‐radda, Uh, ,,

18:30.813 --> 18:34.116
Ohh, [babbling] Huh?

What is the meaning of this?
[grunts]

18:36.919 --> 18:40.690
you think this rope can hold me?
[grunting]

18:40.723 --> 18:43.225
Well [grunts] you [grunts]

18:43.258 --> 18:47.029
are [grunts, exhales deeply]
right,

18:47.062 --> 18:51.133
Hey, Shnitzel, how do you
suppose we get this
poultrygeist out of Chowder?

18:51.166 --> 18:55.805
‐ Wait! No!
‐ [splurt]

18:55.838 --> 18:57.472
This is not the time
for squish‐squash!

18:57.507 --> 18:59.975
Now, according to the
Snackro‐nomicon,

19:00.009 --> 19:02.044
to remove the evil spirit,

19:02.077 --> 19:06.148
we must take
Chowder to the Gravy Yard,

19:06.181 --> 19:08.818
But first,
we must open a portal,

19:08.851 --> 19:10.686
Chant with me, Shnitzel,

19:10.720 --> 19:12.888
‐ Ongawa, ,, ‐ Ra‐radda,

19:24.099 --> 19:26.702
You'll never take me, Mung Daal!

19:26.736 --> 19:28.904
You'll never take me!

19:28.938 --> 19:30.506
Where are you taking me,
Mung Daal?

19:30.540 --> 19:34.243
‐ Where are you taking me?!
‐ Hey! Where are we?!

19:34.276 --> 19:37.079
Is everyone here?
Good,

19:37.112 --> 19:39.414
Why, hello, my name
is Pretzelface,

19:39.448 --> 19:42.084
I'll be your guide
to the Gravy Yard here

19:42.117 --> 19:44.854
on the beautiful river
Pretzelsticks today,

19:44.887 --> 19:48.858
Any questions,
don't bother asking, Heyo!

19:48.891 --> 19:52.461
‐ [Mung Daal laughs] ‐ [grunts]

19:52.494 --> 19:54.029
Now, folks, on the left,

19:54.063 --> 19:56.365
you'll see the purple‐headed
yellaphant,

19:56.398 --> 19:59.702
Some people say the yellaphant
squirts gravy from its nose,

19:59.735 --> 20:02.371
but I say it's snot, Heyo!

20:02.404 --> 20:05.374
[Mung Daal laughs]
This guy is good!

20:05.407 --> 20:07.877
[grunting]

20:07.910 --> 20:10.045
Whoa, watch out
on the right, folks,

20:10.079 --> 20:13.883
We got a flock
of asparagus spirahna,

20:13.916 --> 20:16.986
‐ Oh, my,
‐ Stay inside the boat, folks,

20:17.019 --> 20:20.823
These fish are looking
for a "handout," Heyo!

20:20.856 --> 20:25.394
[laughs] A handout!
So clever,

20:25.427 --> 20:28.898
[both sigh]

20:28.931 --> 20:31.734
We finally made it
to the Hall of Aerobics,

20:31.767 --> 20:35.470
Okay, why is there aerobics
equipment in the Gravy Yard?

20:35.505 --> 20:41.343
Woman, don't you know,
it's to "exercise" demons!

20:41.376 --> 20:43.278
Wah wah,

20:43.312 --> 20:44.980
Hurry, we haven't much time!

20:45.014 --> 20:48.083
Mung Daal, your mother
was a polar bear!

20:48.117 --> 20:52.021
Your father was a figure skater!
Blarga‐flarga‐larga!

20:52.054 --> 20:54.624
Shnitzel, start
the workout music!

Radda!

20:56.291 --> 20:58.260
[mid‐tempo dance music plays]

20:58.293 --> 20:59.862
We know you're
in there, Chowder!

20:59.895 --> 21:02.497
Run towards the flurkey!

21:02.532 --> 21:05.134
This will never work,
Mung Daal, [gasps]

21:05.167 --> 21:07.436
You smell of flowers and cheese!

21:07.469 --> 21:11.206
‐ We're losing him!
‐ Faster, Chowder! Run faster!

21:11.240 --> 21:16.345
This cannot be! Mung Daal, I'll
eat your ears with a spoon!

21:16.378 --> 21:20.282
[gasps] Then I'll sing you songs
of pain and‐‐ oh, wait,

21:20.315 --> 21:22.718
You won't have ears, Darn it!

21:22.752 --> 21:24.119
[Mung Daal] It's working!

21:24.153 --> 21:26.155
He's sweating out the juices!

21:26.188 --> 21:28.624
No, my juices!

Body becoming skinny

21:30.926 --> 21:32.562
and really unattractive!

21:32.595 --> 21:35.831
Must leave this withering husk
of a body!

‐ We did it!
‐ [normal voice] Mung?

21:46.108 --> 21:48.978
Can we go back
to the kitchen now?

21:49.011 --> 21:52.715
I'm, ,, so hungry!

21:52.748 --> 21:56.485
‐ [laughter]
‐ He's back! My boy is back!

21:56.519 --> 22:01.056
Hey, look! I'm a plump,

22:01.090 --> 22:04.059
‐ Hooray!
‐ [all] Hooray!

22:04.093 --> 22:06.696
I'm the happiest bird
in the world,

22:06.729 --> 22:11.066
And from now on, I'm gonna
make people happy!

22:11.100 --> 22:14.670
[Truffles burps]
Ah, that was delicious!

22:14.704 --> 22:17.740
Yes, Florentine did
end up making people happy,

22:17.773 --> 22:21.076
[laughter]

22:21.110 --> 22:23.513
Now let us never
speak of it again,

‐ Radda radda, ‐ The end!

22:26.315 --> 22:29.118
[demonic voice] Blarga‐flarga!

22:30.553 --> 22:33.723
Now, the best way
is to swing downward, like so,

22:33.756 --> 22:36.025
‐ Koo‐ka!
‐ Oh, I see,

22:36.058 --> 22:38.460
You'd be amazed how
effective this is,

22:38.493 --> 22:41.864
‐ I can imagine,
‐ It's all in the wrist,
sweetie,

22:41.897 --> 22:45.367
Up and down,
Be one with the rolling pin,

22:45.400 --> 22:47.202
‐ Now you try!
‐ Koo‐ka!

22:47.236 --> 22:51.040
Very good, Pretty soon you'll be
able to control your man, too,

22:51.073 --> 22:52.808
Really?

22:52.842 --> 22:56.111
