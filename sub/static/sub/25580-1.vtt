Yeah, sure.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.690
OK. Yeah, I love you too.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.810
I am so sorry.
Ah, it's not a problem.

03:15.010 --> 03:18.930

fell asleep in my kitchen chair.

03:19.090 --> 03:20.250

03:20.450 --> 03:23.370
No, I can't do sleeping pills.
They zonk me out for the next day.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.130
No, no, no - these are herbal.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.330
No, you're absolutely normal
by 11 the next day, easy.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.850
Right. Although they do stink

03:31.010 --> 03:32.410
Well, they sound marvellous!

03:32.610 --> 03:35.370

Hey, Jake!

03:38.290 --> 03:40.130
Morning, boss.
What we got?

03:40.330 --> 03:42.170
They're laying new
drainage channels down here,

03:42.290 --> 03:43.730
been doing it the last three months,

03:43.810 --> 03:46.410
and then last night,
one of the workmen,

03:46.610 --> 03:49.490
who happens to have trained
as a doctor in Basra, dug up this...

03:49.690 --> 03:52.770
which he suspected was a section
of a human hip bone.

03:52.970 --> 03:56.090
Dr Balcombe came out early doors,
confirmed it was human,

03:56.250 --> 03:57.570
which is when they called for us.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.170
SHE SIGHS
Oké, let's have a look.

04:16.209 --> 04:18.450
I'm sure you think I'm being daft.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.130
There's absolutely nothing
to be embarrassed about, Harry.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.130
Nothing at all.

04:23.290 --> 04:24.490
As you might imagine,

04:24.690 --> 04:27.570
death is a pretty constant part
of my daily life,

04:27.770 --> 04:31.450
and if I've learned anything
in the last 35 years,

04:31.650 --> 04:34.130
it's that grief takes
every form imaginable.

04:34.330 --> 04:37.170
Hm. For some,
it passes quite quickly.

04:37.330 --> 04:39.850
For others, it can last many years.

04:40.050 --> 04:45.810
Neither is right or wrong,
they're both just... how it is.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.730
You were with Wendy for 63 years.

04:48.890 --> 04:50.890
She was a part of you.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.010
So, to still miss her
after just two...

04:53.170 --> 04:56.010
Well, it's the... blink of an eye.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.130
So, please, never be embarrassed

05:00.330 --> 05:02.330
about wanting to talk about her
with me.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.690
In fact,
I want you to talk about her.

05:04.730 --> 05:07.010
I miss her, too.

05:08.730 --> 05:09.890
Is the position significant?

05:10.090 --> 05:12.530
What, that it's archaeological,
you mean? Yeah.

05:12.690 --> 05:14.410
Not really, no.

05:14.570 --> 05:16.370
Most cultures buried their dead

05:16.570 --> 05:19.130
in a variety of positions -
Romans, Saxons, early medieval...

05:19.290 --> 05:20.730
It could be any of those.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.210
But your instinct is
that it is archaeological?

05:24.410 --> 05:26.410
Well, I have no evidence of that,
it's just...

05:26.610 --> 05:29.370
on balance, for obvious reasons,
I think it's more likely than not.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.930
Why?

05:31.090 --> 05:33.210
Well, because of where it is.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.410
Who buries a body in the
central reservation of the M1?

05:35.450 --> 05:37.770
Someone who doesn't want it found?

05:39.010 --> 05:41.170
I guess, I just...
So how much is remaining?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.530
About 60%, I think.

05:43.690 --> 05:45.170
I'll know more when I get her back.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.890
Right, so you think it's female?
I think, from the pelvis shape.

05:48.050 --> 05:50.650
Again, I can confirm that
when I get everything out.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.210
No clothing fragments?

05:52.370 --> 05:54.290
Not found any yet, no.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.330
It would appear we just have bones.

what the land was used for

06:33.170 --> 06:35.010
before construction of the motorway.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.730
Did you know that Edgware Road
was built on Watling Street?

06:37.930 --> 06:39.626
Old Roman road, did you know that?
I didn't.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.290
I didn't know that.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.290
I didn't know that.
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

Er, yeah, why?

07:02.290 --> 07:04.130
No, no, just...

07:04.290 --> 07:07.010
'you weren't home last night.'

07:07.170 --> 07:08.650
I-I'm at Jen's.

07:08.850 --> 07:10.770
'I told you.'
Did you?

07:10.970 --> 07:13.810
I told you yesterday at breakfast
I was staying at hers.

07:13.970 --> 07:16.090
Sorry, my mistake.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.730
'Anyway, it's... it's no problem.'

07:18.890 --> 07:19.890
I'll see you tonight?

07:20.050 --> 07:21.930
Yeah, I'll see you later. Yeah.
'OK, great.'

07:22.130 --> 07:25.690
Or, you know, stay out,
it's not a problem.

07:25.850 --> 07:27.530
Oh... Thanks!

07:27.690 --> 07:29.610
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

07:29.770 --> 07:31.930
I gotta go. Lots of love, bye!

07:36.770 --> 07:39.410
Actually would be quite smart,
don't you think?

07:39.570 --> 07:40.730
What would?

07:40.930 --> 07:44.410
If you killed someone, burying
them in a central reservation.

07:44.610 --> 07:47.410
Smart? Yeah, if you were
a construction worker,

07:47.610 --> 07:49.770
lanes were already closed
for repairs...

07:49.810 --> 07:53.170
Even if you weren't
a construction worker, just...

07:53.370 --> 07:55.170
hiring a van,
getting a hi-vis jacket,

07:55.370 --> 07:57.850
three in the morning,
put up some bollards...

07:59.370 --> 08:01.930
Then start digging a grave
in the middle of a motorway?

08:02.130 --> 08:05.250
I mean, it'd take balls, give you
that, but... who's gonna stop you?

08:05.450 --> 08:08.250
Who's gonna think, "Oh, I bet
he's not a construction worker.

08:08.410 --> 08:11.130
"I bet he's... burying a body."

08:12.650 --> 08:14.810
You know, the fishy smell's
really not that bad -

08:14.850 --> 08:17.810
I think you should try them.
Yeah, all right!

08:57.170 --> 08:59.490
Oh, we're up, are we, young man?

08:59.650 --> 09:03.210
Oh, super dog! Super, super dog!

09:03.370 --> 09:05.490
You've decided to get up, have you?

09:05.650 --> 09:07.090
Here's breakfast.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.930
Today's the day big day, super dog,

09:11.090 --> 09:12.410
when everything changes.

09:12.570 --> 09:15.050
Yes, my Frankie,

09:15.210 --> 09:16.770
today's the big day!

09:20.010 --> 09:23.250
So it is female, and from the teeth,
I can tell you she's young -

09:23.410 --> 09:25.090
early 20s, oldest. OK.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.130
Most importantly,
you were right, DCI Stuart -

09:27.330 --> 09:30.170
these remains
are not archaeological.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.610
Do you see that? The bone suffered
a compound fracture at some point

09:33.770 --> 09:35.210
and was fixed with a surgical plate.

09:35.250 --> 09:39.290
So, plates have been used commonly
for about a hundred years,

09:39.450 --> 09:40.570
but if it's titanium -

09:40.770 --> 09:43.730
given the lack of corrosion,
my guess is that it is - then...

09:43.930 --> 09:47.090
this is no more than 50,
60 years old, tops.

10:22.130 --> 10:24.610
HE SIGHS

10:24.770 --> 10:30.970
Find the need, sell the want.

10:34.170 --> 10:35.610
Sell the want.

10:51.450 --> 10:55.130
I'm not sure if I'm going to
sign anything today, Mr Carr.

10:55.330 --> 10:58.530
And I completely understand that,
Mr Salthouse.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.890
And tell me, is it the amount
that's worrying you?

11:01.050 --> 11:02.690
Well...

11:02.850 --> 11:03.930
Is it too much?

11:04.090 --> 11:05.530
Well, possibly, but also...

11:05.730 --> 11:07.690
So, what do you think
you could afford?

11:07.850 --> 11:09.490
Well, as I say, it's not just the...

11:09.690 --> 11:12.610
8,000? If you feel ten's too much,
how about eight?

11:13.730 --> 11:15.530
You see, eight is still...

11:15.690 --> 11:16.690
Seven, then?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.090
I suppose...

11:21.290 --> 11:23.970
I suppose I might be prepared
to invest... three.

11:24.130 --> 11:25.770
Three.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.450
Perhaps. Perhaps three.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.290
Three's not enough.
I'm sorry?

11:30.450 --> 11:31.930
Three's fine,

11:32.130 --> 11:34.970
and I can do you the same terms
for three, so we're all set.

11:35.130 --> 11:37.130
Right, well...

11:37.290 --> 11:38.930
I'll get my cheque book, then.

11:40.690 --> 11:43.370
It's here somewhere...

11:43.530 --> 11:46.650
Just sign and date it, Mr Salthouse.

11:46.810 --> 11:48.370
I've got a stamp.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.290
So, first up, yes, it's titanium.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.410
So, 60 years old, oldest?

12:25.610 --> 12:28.010
Give or take.
And then, there's this...

12:28.210 --> 12:31.490
which I'm guessing is some sort of
manufacturer's mark?

12:31.650 --> 12:32.690
You ever seen that before?

12:32.850 --> 12:34.330
Nope, and I've seen hundreds
of these.

12:34.450 --> 12:38.410
But plates do usually have
a manufacturer's mark on them?

12:38.610 --> 12:41.730
No, usually,
they have serial numbers indented.

12:41.890 --> 12:42.970
For all of them? Yes.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.130
So...?

12:44.170 --> 12:46.170
So, I'm guessing this is foreign.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.930
So she could've come from anywhere.

12:49.130 --> 12:52.130
Do EU ones have serial numbers?
I think so.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.810
At least from when the country
joined, but you'd have to check.

12:54.890 --> 12:57.490
She could be British, gone abroad
and had the plate fitted there.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.770
That's also a possibility. OK.

12:59.970 --> 13:04.450
Can't you determine...
race or ethnicity from a skull?

13:04.650 --> 13:07.050
To a degree.
It's not an exact science.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.970
I mean, there are certainly
general characteristics

13:10.170 --> 13:13.130
of Asian skulls versus African
versus European, etcetera,

13:13.330 --> 13:15.850
but they suggest a likelihood
of origin, no more than that.

13:16.010 --> 13:17.090
OK, can you do that for us?

13:17.290 --> 13:20.290
Mm. And age-wise,
you said early 20s...

13:20.490 --> 13:22.626
Would you be able to narrow it down
any more than that?

13:22.650 --> 13:24.370
We'll be doing an
ossification test -

13:24.570 --> 13:26.730
cartilage turns to bone
at a very specific age.

13:26.930 --> 13:28.770
That should narrow it down
considerably.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.810
Who might be best-placed to
recognise who the manufacturer is?

13:32.010 --> 13:35.050
I'd start with the orthopaedics
departments of large city hospitals.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.810
Given the amount of foreign-born
NHS employees we have, there's...

13:39.010 --> 13:41.650
got to be a good chance you'll
come across a surgeon who's inserted

13:41.770 --> 13:43.970
a plate with that mark on it.
Mm-hm.

13:48.570 --> 13:50.010
Well, that's it for this week.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.530
Join us same time next week
for the first of the semis.

13:52.730 --> 13:55.010
It's goodbye from our teams...
- Goodbye!

13:55.170 --> 13:56.970

14:33.770 --> 14:36.490
Oh, of course, yeah!
They're so lovely...

14:36.690 --> 14:38.650
So, couple of messages
from the production office.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.650
Your friend Pete rang,
something about a dinner?

14:40.730 --> 14:41.730
OK, thank you.

14:41.810 --> 14:44.186
And then your wife has rung twice,
needs you to call her. Amy?

14:44.210 --> 14:45.570
Yeah. Right, thanks, Kelly.

14:45.770 --> 14:47.730
Recording again in 20 minutes.
All right.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.410
Start with the hospitals...

14:49.610 --> 14:52.130
OK. I might stick a photo
of that mark on Twitter as well.

14:52.330 --> 14:55.370
Yeah, good, cos if we can identify
the origin of the plate,

14:55.570 --> 14:58.650
possibly narrow down a time window,
that's gonna be key.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.530
You want to look at
missing persons yet? Er...

15:01.690 --> 15:02.850
SHE SIGHS

15:03.050 --> 15:05.930
Well, until we know
what country it was made in

15:06.130 --> 15:08.850
and the likely ethnicity of the
victim, no, I can't see the point.

15:14.490 --> 15:15.770
Hiya.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.970
Where've you been?
I've left half a dozen messages.

15:18.130 --> 15:19.490
In recording. What's up?

15:19.650 --> 15:21.410
It's Eliot...

15:21.610 --> 15:23.530
'I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, '

15:23.730 --> 15:26.410
but apparently his flatmate hasn't
seen him for a couple of days.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.130
Who rang you?

15:28.290 --> 15:29.650
Melissa.

15:29.850 --> 15:32.090
Oh, so she rings you before
she rings me now, does she?

15:32.290 --> 15:34.250
Only because you'd end up
screaming at each other.

15:34.370 --> 15:37.890
I'm still his dad, Amy.
She should ring me.

15:38.050 --> 15:39.610
Has she spoken to him, the flatmate?

15:39.770 --> 15:41.010
Ed. Yes, briefly.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.850
She said she's going to finish work
early and get there about four.

15:43.890 --> 15:47.610
What work? She's been writing
the same shit novel for ten years!

15:47.810 --> 15:50.210
Erm... can you call her?
I'm about to start again.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.250
'Tell her I'll meet her there.'
Sure.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.090
And, Jamie, it'll be fine.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.570
'He'll be fine.' Yeah.

15:56.770 --> 15:59.610
'Call me when you've seen Mel,
yeah?'

15:59.770 --> 16:00.850
Sure.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.810
Hey, Chris. Hiya.

16:20.970 --> 16:23.250
Nice to see you. How are you?

16:23.410 --> 16:25.810
Oh, I'm good. I'm good, thanks.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.170
How are you?
Ah, you know, not too shabby.

16:28.210 --> 16:30.890
Glad you dropped in, actually -
sold two more pieces at the weekend.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.570
Oh! Oh, OK!

16:33.770 --> 16:36.010
Got a bit of space for
a couple more, if you have any?

16:36.170 --> 16:38.490
Yeah, I'm working on something...

16:38.650 --> 16:41.170
maybe beginning of next week?

16:41.330 --> 16:42.450
Perfect.

16:45.490 --> 16:47.490
Rob, I-I need some of my money.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.810
Er, yes, not a problem.
Erm, how much?

16:50.970 --> 16:52.370
4,000, please.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.370
OK, fine.

16:54.530 --> 16:56.090
Sorry, you mean now?

16:56.250 --> 16:58.410
Yeah. Right!

16:58.610 --> 17:02.810
Well, I have to go to the bank,
obviously. Can you wait ten minutes?

17:02.970 --> 17:04.609
Uh-huh, yeah.

17:05.730 --> 17:06.849
So...

17:09.450 --> 17:11.609
..that's quite a lot of money,
Chris,

17:11.650 --> 17:15.170
and I'm very happy to get it
for you, of course,

17:15.369 --> 17:17.250
but you're absolutely sure
you need all of this?

17:18.650 --> 17:19.890
I am, yeah.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.810
Have you got somewhere safe
to keep it?

17:22.970 --> 17:24.050
Yeah.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.089
Erm, well...

17:26.290 --> 17:29.650
do you wanna wait outside,
or maybe you could hold the fort...?

17:29.810 --> 17:32.490
No, no, I'll wait out there.

17:32.650 --> 17:33.930
No problem.

17:42.730 --> 17:45.650
You're over-thinking it, love.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.450
So you read it as him hiding,

17:47.650 --> 17:49.930
I read it as he was just busy,
you know,

17:50.130 --> 17:53.570
preparing his dad's lunch,
changing his bed sheets or whatever.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.546
So why didn't he come out
when I said goodbye?

17:55.570 --> 17:56.890
He probably just didn't hear you.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.170
Mm.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.850
Tim, sweetheart...

18:03.290 --> 18:04.450
..I promise you,

18:04.650 --> 18:08.170
no-one in this town believes a word
of these allegations.

18:08.370 --> 18:11.890
They know you,
and they know Alison Pinion.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.810
They certainly know Alison has
a grudge against this practice.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.930
As your rep says, the case won't
even get to the next stage.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.570
So, please,
just try and forget about it, hm?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.210
Let's just have a lovely evening
tonight with your girls.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.370
Come on.

18:33.890 --> 18:37.690
DRAMATIC MUSIC
SWELLS OVER SPEECH

19:20.650 --> 19:22.410
INAUDIBLE

19:22.610 --> 19:26.970
Ah, these are Greek letters...
erm, intertwined.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.170
You see that...

19:28.370 --> 19:31.490
You see there,
that is an A and the X is a C.

19:31.650 --> 19:33.770
Stands for "Angelis and Christos".

19:33.810 --> 19:37.170
They're a Cypriot firm,
based in Nicosia. Right.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.570
They do all sorts of surgical stuff.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.530
Do you know if they're
still in operation?

19:41.730 --> 19:45.970
Er, I think so. I think
they only started in the '80s.

19:47.090 --> 19:49.810
And certainly, they were still
in operation when I worked there...

19:49.970 --> 19:51.730
couple of years ago?

19:54.210 --> 19:57.010
DCI Stuart, it's Leanne Balcombe.

19:58.090 --> 20:01.330
So, I just spoke to Dr Balcombe...

20:01.530 --> 20:05.730
and her tests suggest
that the skull is European,

20:05.770 --> 20:08.210
which narrows things down a bit.

20:08.410 --> 20:11.810
So we now know that the plate
is made by a Greek company,

20:12.010 --> 20:14.690
Angelis and Christos,
based in Cyprus.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.770
Now, they didn't start
operating until 1984,

20:17.970 --> 20:20.250
so that's as old
as the plate can be.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.290
But I've sent them some photos
and the MD's gonna come back to me,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.386
see if he can help us
narrow the dates down a bit.

20:25.410 --> 20:28.210
But, er, in the meantime,

20:28.370 --> 20:30.250
we can now also tell you...

20:31.770 --> 20:36.610
..Dr Balcombe did various tests
on the major bones and teeth.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.690
And she was able to determine,

20:38.890 --> 20:42.650
with, actually,
a pretty good deal of certainty,

20:42.850 --> 20:46.850
that these remains are actually
those of a young female...

20:50.490 --> 20:56.090
..between the ages of 13 and 15.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.290
So, this is not an adult,
it's not even a young adult.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.370
This is the body of a child.

21:06.370 --> 21:08.970
So, as of now,
we have a window of 34 years,

21:09.170 --> 21:11.170
and as soon as we hear back
from A&C,

21:11.370 --> 21:14.490
we start searching for all
missing children of that age.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.530
We're gonna start with the UK,
but if we have to,

21:17.730 --> 21:21.330
we'll liaise with Interpol
and roll this out across Europe,

21:21.530 --> 21:26.570
because not many children
of that age go missing

21:26.730 --> 21:28.530
without leaving people behind.

21:28.690 --> 21:29.690
And...

21:31.130 --> 21:34.410
..somewhere,
there surely must be parents...

21:34.610 --> 21:38.970
who have lived in a world
of almost unimaginable pain...

21:41.050 --> 21:42.450
..for many, many years.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.330
Let's give them their child back.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.040
Don't apologise - your English
is better than my Greek.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.240
'Anyway, what we can tell you
is that in 2004,

22:08.440 --> 22:11.880
'when we joined the EU,
in line with EU regulations,

22:12.080 --> 22:15.000
'we started using serial numbers
on all our plates,

22:15.160 --> 22:16.600
'so it has to predate that.'

22:16.800 --> 22:18.680
Well, that is already
extremely useful.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.320
'And the logo, we didn't start
using that until '95.'

22:22.480 --> 22:24.680
'95?

22:24.880 --> 22:29.080
Right, so... that has to have been
made in this nine-year period?

22:29.240 --> 22:30.800
'Oh, absolutely.'

22:31.920 --> 22:34.320
Right. Thank you.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.240
'So, what time
do you think you'll be back?'

22:36.280 --> 22:37.520
Not late, six-ish.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.120
Thought I might take the boys
to the beach if it stays dry.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.840
Yeah, they'd love that.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.080
'No problem.'

22:43.280 --> 22:46.840
Oh, and by the way, the boiler's
turned itself off again.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.880
Right, remember,
just press the reset button, then...

22:50.040 --> 22:51.120
Yeah, I know.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.960
I did it eight times
before it fired up.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.720
'It's broken, Pete.'

22:54.880 --> 22:57.480
I'll look at it later. Back at six.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.120
Yeah, OK.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.400
Mum!

23:00.560 --> 23:01.560
Oh, OK!

23:14.520 --> 23:19.160
When a man goes into a shop, Pete,
to ask for a quarter-inch drill bit,

23:19.360 --> 23:22.280
he doesn't really want
a quarter-inch drill bit, does he?

23:22.440 --> 23:23.760
Doesn't he?

23:23.920 --> 23:26.040
What he actually wants...

23:26.200 --> 23:27.720
is a quarter-inch hole.

23:27.920 --> 23:32.360
I'm sorry, Mark, I've got absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.200
You've asked me for new leads,
but what you actually want

23:36.360 --> 23:38.320
is to be making more money, right?

23:38.520 --> 23:41.560
Of course.
Which I can't give you.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.240
I couldn't give you
a quarter-inch hole...

23:45.920 --> 23:48.080
..and I can't make you
a better salesman.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.840
So she was found in the UK,

23:54.040 --> 23:58.000
and I think it's fair to assume
she's more likely to be British.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.200
Yeah.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.560
And if she is British...

24:02.080 --> 24:06.040
..why might she have had
an operation in Cyprus?

24:06.240 --> 24:08.200
Cos she was on holiday?
With her family.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.560
And according to the insurance rep
I just spoke to,

24:10.760 --> 24:14.680
most families on holiday in Cyprus,
they go to Paphos.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.280
So we make contact
with this hospital,

24:17.480 --> 24:20.120
see what records
they have from then.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.680
Meanwhile, get the team
to start an outstanding review

24:22.880 --> 24:25.920
of UK miss pers of, say,
12 to 16-year-old girls

24:26.080 --> 24:29.000
between '95 and 2004.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.720
Yeah, I'll get them onto it. Mm.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.760
Hey, Pete, I got your message.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.240
Sorry I'm being rubbish,
but work's mad now.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.240
So, yeah, let's put in a date
for a meet-up.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.640
Why don't I call Tim
and you do Chris?

24:47.680 --> 24:50.000
I miss you, big man.
Lots of love.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.960
How's he been the last few weeks?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.400
How's his... mood been,
would you say?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.160
I dunno, he's just seemed...

24:59.320 --> 25:00.560
really stressed.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.320
Stressed? Yeah.
Stressed by what?

25:02.480 --> 25:03.600
Dunno.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.520
Stressed by watching back-to-back
Family Guy all day long? James...

25:06.720 --> 25:09.600
Stressed by having to choose exactly
how he'll fuck my life up this week?

25:09.640 --> 25:11.520
What d'you think?
I'm just trying to help, mate.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.040
To be honest, it's not my problem.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.280
For what it's worth,

25:18.440 --> 25:20.840
having a father like you...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
would stress the fuck out of anyone.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.360
Does it ever get tiring,
being so angry all the time?

25:29.400 --> 25:32.440
Does it get tiring
being such a smug tit?

25:37.600 --> 25:39.160
Sorry.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.360
HE SIGHS

25:42.520 --> 25:45.520
You'd think 20 years of this,

25:45.720 --> 25:47.560
of wondering every time
he goes off on one

25:47.760 --> 25:49.960
if this is the time
he'll wind up in a canal,

25:50.160 --> 25:53.080
would inure you to the fear,
but it just seems to make it worse.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.240
For us both.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.840
I'll do the pubs,
you do the dealers.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.760
SIGHS

26:08.760 --> 26:10.440
OFFICE CHATTER

26:22.240 --> 26:26.800
Hello, um, do you speak English?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.360
Brilliant, brilliant.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.920
Yeah, wonder if you can
help me with something...

26:39.720 --> 26:41.440
Eight.
- Eight.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.760
Friday. Friday.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.600
Saturday. Saturday.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.760
Sunday...

26:46.880 --> 26:49.480
Can I use the phone in the office?
I can never get signal in here.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.120
Yeah, yeah, no problem. Thanks.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.200
But he's, he's OK now?

27:01.400 --> 27:04.800
Yeah. I got him back to sleep
at about five,

27:04.960 --> 27:07.360
and then he slept in till midday.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.800
Oh, and... was it about his dad?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.840
'No, he rarely dreams about
his dad.'

27:14.040 --> 27:18.240
He was too little to remember,
really. No, it's...

27:18.400 --> 27:20.640
pretty much always the gas.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.920
'I'm so sorry.'

27:22.960 --> 27:26.160
Listen, it's much better
than it used to be.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.200
'This was the first time in months.'

27:28.400 --> 27:32.160
Would you like me to come round?
I could do some painting with him?

27:32.320 --> 27:34.000
I think he'd love that.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.360
How about... tomorrow, after school?

27:37.520 --> 27:41.360
Yeah, well, OK. Four-ish?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.840
'Perfect.'

27:43.000 --> 27:46.800
Oh, OK. Er, well, you...

27:46.960 --> 27:48.640
'..send him my love.'

27:48.840 --> 27:50.680
I will.
'And I'll, I'll see you tomorrow.'

27:50.840 --> 27:51.840
Bye.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.800
GULLS CALL

27:57.000 --> 27:59.560
Come on,
see if you can tackle me!

27:59.760 --> 28:01.520
You're just running away,
miles away...

28:02.840 --> 28:04.160
Here we go!

28:05.800 --> 28:07.400
Oh, looking dangerous now.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.760
It's looking dangerous.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.080
Can we save...? Oh!

28:10.240 --> 28:11.240
Ohh!

28:11.320 --> 28:13.080
Here we go.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.080
Go and get that!

28:21.240 --> 28:24.280
And have you started pronouncing
your words stupidly yet?

28:24.480 --> 28:26.720
'Only when I eat...
- ...oreg-ano.'

28:26.880 --> 28:28.320
On your ris-o-tto?

28:30.240 --> 28:32.960
'New York's actually pretty like
London. It's just... cooler.'

28:33.160 --> 28:35.760
Yeah, well, don't get too attached,
cos you're not moving there.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.360
'Oh, am I not?'

28:37.520 --> 28:39.680
Sorry, needed here, I'm afraid.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.240
'Right, you see, I didn't realise
I had no say in this decision.'

28:43.400 --> 28:44.600
THEY LAUGH

28:44.760 --> 28:45.880
'How's Grandad?'

28:46.040 --> 28:48.320
Yeah, all good.

28:48.480 --> 28:49.520
'He there?'

28:49.680 --> 28:51.960
Er... no, no,

28:52.120 --> 28:56.120
because he's out with Jenny tonight.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.280
'Wo-o-ow! Wow!
That's quite a thing, isn't it?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.640
'How long have they been goin' out?'

29:01.800 --> 29:04.120
Er, well, dunno. A while.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.640
'Adam! Adam!'

29:06.840 --> 29:09.520
'Yeah, I'm coming.'
Six months, maybe?

29:09.680 --> 29:11.240
'Just gimme a sec.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.520
'Mum, look, I gotta go.'

29:12.680 --> 29:14.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you go.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.120
'I'll call you next week, yeah?
I love you.'

29:16.240 --> 29:19.240
And do some bloody work, cos
that is why you're there, remem...?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.840
PHONE RINGS

29:33.960 --> 29:35.800
Hiya. 'Er, boss...'

29:36.000 --> 29:38.240
Yeah, yeah, sorry to disturb you.
LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND

29:38.400 --> 29:39.680
'No, no problem.'

29:39.840 --> 29:41.720
The Paphos hospital just emailed me.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.080
'They lost all of their
pre-2008 records in a fire

29:44.120 --> 29:45.240
'a couple of years ago.'

29:45.400 --> 29:46.520
Shit.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.440
'Yeah, irritating.'

29:48.640 --> 29:52.200
Obviously, I'll try the other
hospitals in the morning, but...

29:52.400 --> 29:54.160
'for now,
we're back to a nine-year window.'

29:54.360 --> 29:58.040
OK, well,
thanks for letting me know.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.560
SIGHS

30:01.360 --> 30:03.080
'Sounds like it's going well...'

30:03.240 --> 30:04.440
You're doing great.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.760
'Sunny?'

30:05.920 --> 30:07.200
Yes, boss - sorry.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.240
Er, it is, very. I'll let you go.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.920
'Have a great evening.'
And you. Night.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.440
'Night.'

30:18.560 --> 30:20.520
MICROWAVE DINGS

30:28.480 --> 30:32.400
I know you feel she can be tricky,
but... can't you just reach out?

30:32.560 --> 30:33.720
She's your mum.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.120
And there were very good reasons
you got divorced, Dad.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.496
Can we not turn this into another
Mum slag fest, please?

30:38.520 --> 30:39.880
I completely agree.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.840
She's a lovely lady who did
extremely well to put up with me

30:43.000 --> 30:44.200
for as long as she did.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.640
Maybe we can do a trip up there
for her birthday?

30:46.840 --> 30:49.480
Not a chance. I'm driving 300 miles
to the middle of nowhere to...

30:49.680 --> 30:52.040
OK, fine, forget about it.
Let's talk about something else.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.440
Let's talk about why we're here...
Here's to you both.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.080
Happy anniversary!

30:56.240 --> 30:57.616
And a huge well done to you, Carol,

30:57.640 --> 31:00.720
for tolerating the old bastard
for ten years. To Dad and Carol.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.600
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.200
Excuse me...

31:06.400 --> 31:09.600
Just wanted to say, Dr Finch,
for what it's worth,

31:09.760 --> 31:11.880
nobody I know believes a word of it.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.160
This is corked.
Is it?

31:25.360 --> 31:27.360
Right, sorry about that,
let me just...

31:27.520 --> 31:29.120
No, no. You don't need to smell it.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.120
I smelt it. It's corked.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.360
I'll bring you another bottle.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.480
Anything?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.120
No.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.200
Looked everywhere, no sign.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.640
HE SIGHS

32:07.400 --> 32:12.280
So, we very much hoped the Cyprus
hospitals could've given us a name

32:12.480 --> 32:15.000
that we would find here,
but they haven't.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.600
Which means now
we have two options -

32:19.800 --> 32:22.720
checking each file
against dental records,

32:22.880 --> 32:24.760
which will be very, very slow...

32:24.960 --> 32:30.080
or we make contact with each of
the families of these missing girls

32:30.280 --> 32:34.960
and ask them if their daughter
ever broke her arm on holiday.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.680
Now, if we find one who did,
and it was in Cyprus,

32:38.840 --> 32:40.520
chances are we've found her.

32:40.720 --> 32:45.200
In the end, I think this is
the least worst option.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.680
But it's gonna be hard.

32:49.880 --> 32:54.520
The best most of these families
will have hoped for, for many years,

32:54.720 --> 32:56.880
will simply have been
finding a body to bury.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.320
And for all but one of them -
that's if we're lucky -

33:00.520 --> 33:03.800
we're gonna offer them
that little glimmer of hope,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
only to snatch it away
seconds later.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.600
So we tread gently, please.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.680
We tread very gently.

33:20.379 --> 33:23.357
I'm so sorry to trouble you -
my name is DC Fran Lingley,

33:23.427 --> 33:26.275
I'm calling from Bishop Street
Police Station in London.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.580
...And I'm part of a team
investigating the discovery

33:28.780 --> 33:31.420
of human remains in Hendon,
North London.

33:31.620 --> 33:37.540
And I wanted, if I may, to ask you
a question in connection with the

33:37.740 --> 33:40.340
disappearance of your daughter,
Annabelle.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.420
Yeah, I'm very sorry to hear that,
Mr Mason.

33:44.620 --> 33:48.580
So, who might still be alive
that I could talk to,

33:48.780 --> 33:51.780
who would know if your sister
ever broke her wrist?

33:51.940 --> 33:53.500
I completely understand,

33:53.700 --> 33:56.580
and I really wish I could've
given you some answers.

33:56.780 --> 33:59.340
Is there someone who can be there
with you, Jackie?

33:59.540 --> 34:02.180
And I can tell you we can eliminate
Michaela from our list.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.100
OK, thank you. Take care. Goodbye.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.340
They're my oldest friends, Maria.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.620
It's one night.

34:19.659 --> 34:22.739
We stay in a Travelodge,
we eat in a pub!

34:22.940 --> 34:25.860
And I can't afford to buy the kids
new shoes.

34:26.020 --> 34:29.100
Josh, Will, downstairs now, please!

34:29.260 --> 34:32.100
CHILDREN GIGGLE UPSTAIRS

34:32.300 --> 34:34.540
But, fine.
Things will get easier, I promise.

34:34.739 --> 34:38.020
I've got some really good business
coming in in the next few weeks.

34:38.219 --> 34:40.275
What? When have you not had
some really good business

34:40.300 --> 34:42.020
about to come through, Pete?

34:42.179 --> 34:43.300
I think the day I met you,

34:43.500 --> 34:45.500
you were about to buy the club
we were drinking in.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.420
Yeah, then the world
went to hell in a handcart.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.420
I mean, I'll take the
blame for a lot of things,

34:49.460 --> 34:50.900
but not the global financial crash!

34:52.340 --> 34:53.860
We're gonna be late.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.659
Look...

34:55.860 --> 34:57.660
buy the kids whatever shoes
they need.

34:57.860 --> 35:00.060
There'll be money in the
joint account tomorrow.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.620
At the end of the day, Tim,
it's your word against hers.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.660
And given what we know about her...

35:34.060 --> 35:35.940
He saying he's at Smudge's,
apparently.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.580
Right, so...

35:37.780 --> 35:40.420
I don't know Smudge.
Where does he live?

35:50.420 --> 35:54.580
Panford House, number 22.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.660
I hope he's OK, Mr Hollis.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.380
Thank you.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.140
You look after yourself, Steven.

36:10.540 --> 36:15.060
No, I'm sorry, if Jasmine never
sustained an injury like that,

36:15.260 --> 36:17.860
then it really can't be her,
I'm afraid.

36:18.060 --> 36:21.420
No, you cry away, Robin,
and I'm so sorry

36:21.620 --> 36:25.140
we can't give you any more
positive news.

36:25.340 --> 36:27.340
And you're her sister, did you say?
'Yeah.'

36:27.540 --> 36:31.180
And how sure are you, Jessica,
that she broke her wrist?

36:31.380 --> 36:34.500
'100%. I remember the cast,
what I wrote on it.'

36:34.660 --> 36:37.380
OK, do you remember how she did it?

36:37.540 --> 36:39.460
She slipped by the swimming pool.

36:39.660 --> 36:43.860
By the swimming pool? So this was
a swimming pool at home, or...?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.860
We were on holiday.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.580
What year would this have been?

36:47.740 --> 36:52.500
Erm... mid-'90s, maybe?

36:52.700 --> 36:54.420
Do you remember where
you were on holiday?

36:54.620 --> 36:58.140
'We were only little, so I'd have to
check with my mum, but, erm...'

36:58.300 --> 36:59.740
I think it was Cyprus?

37:01.380 --> 37:03.661
OK, Jessica, I think we're gonna
have to come and see you,

37:03.780 --> 37:05.300
but in the meantime,
is your mother...?

37:05.340 --> 37:06.940
She lives five minutes away.

37:07.140 --> 37:11.540
Could you ask her about Cyprus for
me, and also ask if she remembers

37:11.740 --> 37:14.700
if Hayley had a surgical plate
fitted following a fracture?

37:14.900 --> 37:17.180
'No problem.' Can you do that now
and get back to us?

37:17.340 --> 37:20.060
Yeah, sure.

37:20.220 --> 37:21.820
'Do you really think it's her?'

37:23.140 --> 37:25.580
Jessica, I...

37:25.780 --> 37:27.980
Obviously, I can't say for sure,
but...

37:29.940 --> 37:31.740
..I think it's certainly
very possible, yes.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.900
I'll call you straight back.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.020
Anyone remember
the Hayley Reid case?

37:48.860 --> 37:51.540
She was on her way to a party,
wasn't she?

37:51.700 --> 37:53.380
Mm. From a shift at a pub.

37:53.540 --> 37:54.980
New Year's Eve.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.620
Millennium, 1999.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.980
Awful. She just... disappeared.

37:59.180 --> 38:01.500
What was the name of the guy
they thought did it?

38:01.660 --> 38:04.060
Mullins, was it? Mullery.

38:04.220 --> 38:06.580
Adrian Mullery was the boyfriend.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.020
We were exactly the same age.

38:10.700 --> 38:13.220
Yeah, I remember my mum
wouldn't let me get a Saturday job

38:13.380 --> 38:14.860
when that happened.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.900
Yeah, I remember her.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.340
Brown stripes,

38:22.500 --> 38:24.260
and there are the trees.

38:27.980 --> 38:29.780
I think you have a gifted child.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.700
He has a real talent.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.260
Well, you bring it out in him,
so thank you.

38:34.420 --> 38:36.340
It gives him such pleasure.

38:38.260 --> 38:40.420
Jamila, I wan...
I wanted to ask you something.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.660
I wanted to ask you...

38:43.860 --> 38:48.100
do you think that
you would ever consider...

38:49.260 --> 38:51.100
..marrying me?

38:54.780 --> 38:56.100
I'm sorry?

38:56.300 --> 38:59.980
I know, yeah, this has probably
come as a bit of a shock...

39:01.540 --> 39:06.100
And I know I'm not what people
would consider "a catch",

39:06.300 --> 39:08.820
but I'm earning good money now
with my paintings,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.140
and I've saved up enough

39:10.340 --> 39:13.700
to put down a deposit on a flat
to rent for us all.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.900
I just...
In the last couple of years,

39:16.100 --> 39:21.580
we've got to know each other
really well, and, erm, months ago...

39:23.860 --> 39:27.660
..I realised that
I was in love with you.

39:29.660 --> 39:34.940
Just... watching you do
ordinary things.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.900
And, yes,
I should've said something sooner,

39:41.100 --> 39:43.260
I should've mentioned it,
but I was so scared.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.580
I was so scared that you wouldn't...

39:45.740 --> 39:47.020
you know.

39:48.380 --> 39:52.300
And I just wanna make things better
for you, Jamila.

39:52.460 --> 39:54.100
For you and for Asif.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.220
And for me, for me, obviously,
for me, because the idea of me

39:58.420 --> 40:00.580
being with you both
and us being a family...

40:02.220 --> 40:03.660
..that'd make me happy.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.380
Wow!

40:07.940 --> 40:10.740
I'm a bit... shocked.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.500
I mean in a good way, but...

40:12.660 --> 40:14.220
You don't have to say anything.

40:14.420 --> 40:18.220
You know, h-have a think about it
and then we can talk soon.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.820
Maybe tomorrow, at the centre...?

40:20.980 --> 40:23.980
Yes, right. And, erm...

40:25.580 --> 40:26.660
..thank you.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.180
I nearly forgot...

40:30.340 --> 40:31.940
I bought you this.

40:42.260 --> 40:43.380
See you tomorrow.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.780
So the complaint against you,
Dr Finch,

41:00.940 --> 41:02.780
is that on the 27th of April 2017,

41:02.980 --> 41:07.180
while on a house call to
Maureen Anne Avery, since deceased,

41:07.220 --> 41:09.740
and seemingly unaware that
her daughter, the complainant,

41:09.900 --> 41:11.540
Alison Pinion, was in the house,

41:11.740 --> 41:14.340
you verbally abused
and threatened Mrs Avery.

41:14.540 --> 41:18.180
Specifically, that you called her
a "tiresome old bitch",

41:18.340 --> 41:19.980
and that you then told her you'd

41:20.180 --> 41:22.340
"half a mind to stick her
full of morphine,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.660
"and give us all a fucking break".

41:33.100 --> 41:39.260
DOORBELL RINGS

41:43.580 --> 41:45.020
CHATTER FROM RADIO
IN BACKGROUND

41:45.180 --> 41:46.220
Mum?!

41:48.140 --> 41:49.780
Mum?

41:51.620 --> 41:54.460
FOOTSTEPS THUD ON STAIRS

41:57.260 --> 41:59.180
Mum?

42:01.780 --> 42:03.740
Wake up, Mum.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.380
Jess...

42:08.700 --> 42:09.940
Jessie, what is it?

42:11.620 --> 42:14.540
When Hayley broke her arm that time
when we were on holiday,

42:14.700 --> 42:16.060
did she have a plate fitted?

42:16.220 --> 42:17.380
What?

42:17.580 --> 42:19.780
I think we were in Cyprus.
Did she have a plate fitted?

42:19.940 --> 42:21.380
Why?

42:21.540 --> 42:22.700
Did she?

42:24.380 --> 42:25.500
Yes.

42:27.180 --> 42:29.020
It was a compound fracture.

42:29.220 --> 42:31.700
She had it done
at the local hospital.

42:31.860 --> 42:32.940
Why?

42:33.100 --> 42:35.780
You're gonna have to get up, Mum.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.620
The police are gonna be
coming down from London.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.420
They think they've found her.

42:45.580 --> 42:47.020
They think they've found Hayley.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.900
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

43:08.020 --> 43:09.420
Eliot?

43:17.580 --> 43:18.900
Hey, Els, how you doing?

43:20.980 --> 43:22.220
Hi, Dad.

43:28.580 --> 43:31.420
GULLS CALL

43:59.340 --> 44:06.420
Eliot!

44:14.900 --> 44:17.540
My client's mother, Mrs Avery,

44:17.740 --> 44:20.420
was diagnosed with dementia
over seven years ago.

44:20.580 --> 44:22.300
As you can imagine...

44:22.460 --> 44:23.740
Oh, shit!

44:48.980 --> 44:52.140
BREATHES HEAVILY

44:59.940 --> 45:03.140
Yes, she had a plate fitted,

45:03.300 --> 45:05.660
and it was in Cyprus.

45:12.540 --> 45:13.780
It's her.

45:25.180 --> 45:28.340
SHE SOBS

45:33.740 --> 45:37.500
WAILS

45:59.860 --> 46:02.820
