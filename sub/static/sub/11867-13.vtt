WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:03.083
CARTER: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.170 --> 00:07.288
The artifact is capable
of human interface,
and you know who it is.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.330
Kevin.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.964
He controls
the field now, Allie.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.045
He '3 evolving.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.513
If they get a hold
of Kevin, he will never
have a normal life.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.466
Well, we have
to get that thing
out of him.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.882
Any structures made of metal
could deteriorate just...

00:17.976 --> 00:18.965
(RUMBLES)

00:19.228 --> 00:20.513
(EXCLAIMS)

00:22.022 --> 00:25.014
Definitely a mutation
on the original strain.

00:25.108 --> 00:30.193
It's like someone flipped
a switch and turned it into
a voracious metal-eating bug.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.365
What if the metal-eating
bacteria mutated again
before we caught it all?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.571
It started jumping
to people?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.911
It's a red-level
security breach.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.454
The bacteria,
it's airborne.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.285
Oh, my God.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.160
CARTER: Is that Beverly?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.537
(ALARM SOUNDING)

00:56.557 --> 00:58.673
MAN ON PA: Biohazard
detected in Section Four.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.137
All personnel,
move to emergency exits.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.217
What the hell
just happened?

01:02.271 --> 01:05.138
The Code Red
biohazard activates
the Panic Room Protocol.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.688
Director's office
becomes a bunker

01:06.733 --> 01:08.064
in case of biological attack.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.403
What about
an airborne bacteria?

01:10.445 --> 01:11.525
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.939
Henry said that the bacteria
mutated and consumed
a corpse in the morgue.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.819
He was afraid that
it had become airborne.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.411
(SIGHS) Looks like
he was right.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.411
Dr. Stark, we've had to
quarantine Section Four
and the people in it.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.663
We need everyone else
into decontamination.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.456
No! We have three adults
and a child...

01:25.544 --> 01:27.330
Carter! He's right.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.249
We can't help
if you and l
are on the menu.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.795
Now, they're in the safest
place in this building.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.294
They are sealed
a mile underneath.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.092
If we're going to help,
we need equipment
and a plan.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.636
And we're really not
giving you a choice, sir.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.771
(RUMBLING)

01:57.242 --> 01:58.573
Mom?
It's okay, baby.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.654
Something set off
the Panic Room.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.201
Well, I don't care
what set it off.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.153
We are getting
out of here.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.488
Well, I want to know
how you got out,

02:04.583 --> 02:06.369
and what the hell
you're doing here.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.242
Why don't you
ask Henry?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.462
We're here for Kevin.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.798
NATHAN: My lab has
a communications link.

02:18.889 --> 02:22.097
Once the Panic Room
is secure, a direct line
to the DOD. is activated.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.975
Allison should have been
in contact by now. Fargo?

02:25.812 --> 02:28.519
I'm on it.
This place would
collapse without me.

02:28.607 --> 02:29.972
It already has.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.391
FARGO: Connecting
General Mansfield now.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.810
Dr. Stark.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.229
General Mansfield,
have you spoken to Dr. Blake?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.531
We've been unable
to make contact.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.529
The Panic Room should have
hooked up automatically.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.407
Well, then I guess
we can assume that
the system's failed.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.616
Now, we are going to need
an acting director until
we can establish contact.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.331
In light of the evidence
you presented before
the review committee,

02:52.631 --> 02:54.997
Review...
What evidence? What?

02:55.509 --> 02:59.593
That Dr. Stark was in no way
responsible for the accident
that killed Kim Anderson.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.920
Who was?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.595
Beverly Bar/owe.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.686
She's in the Panic Room.
You know that, right?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.889
I thought you had her
under control, Dr. Stark.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.186
I'm working on it, General.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.439
We kind of have bigger issues
at the moment, though.
Don't you think?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.606
Yes, we do.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.525
The detection system
is showing us

03:15.612 --> 03:18.729
that the outbreak is spreading
beyond Section Four.

03:18.824 --> 03:22.362
The release of an airborne
pathogen like that
would be catastrophic.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.034
Now, if we cannot
keep it contained,

03:25.122 --> 03:27.579
I will order
a thermal cleaning
of that entire facility.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.500
General, a thermal cleaning
will wipe out all organic
material in Global Dynamics.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.663
It will set our research
back decades, not to mention
kill everyone in Section Four.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.832
Well, then, I guess we better
get it contained.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.216
You had proof
that Beverly killed Kim,
and you didn't say anything?

03:47.269 --> 03:48.258
I couldn't.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.854
You couldn't?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.060
lt's complicated, Carter.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.230
You knew she was
the subject of an
open investigation,

03:53.316 --> 03:54.567
and you brought her here
behind my back,

03:54.651 --> 03:57.563
and now she's locked
in a room with Allison,
Kevin and Henry.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.738
Now,

04:00.574 --> 04:02.656
does he know that
Beverly killed Kim?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.907
Who do you think
gave me the evidence?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.409
Call Taggart. Get him
to meet us at Global
and bring his gear.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.824
Okay. Why?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.747
'Cause we're going back in.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.876
I still can't believe
I let you talk me
into chaperoning.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.500
Hey, no one snapped off
your fingers.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.627
The ease with which
you say that is almost
as disturbing as it is hot.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.961
I know.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.714
Hey, Chia Pet,
wanna dance?

05:08.934 --> 05:10.845
Well, when you ask
like that...

05:10.936 --> 05:13.302
SARAH: A biohazard's
been detected at 6.0.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.596
All residents
must remain indoors.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.607
All bio-preservation
lockdowns are engaged.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.393
Jo, where's my dad?

05:26.701 --> 05:30.159
These suits should protect us
from the nasty
little buggers.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.820
What do you mean,
"should"?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.868
You guys ready?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.082
Rodger dodger, Fargo.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.034
All right,
once you exit the elevator,

05:38.129 --> 05:40.541
radio signals will be jammed
by the building's
security system

05:40.632 --> 05:41.997
and we'll lose contact.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.334
You have to reach the main
communications center
in Section Four.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.968
If it wasn't damaged
by the ceiling collapse,

05:47.013 --> 05:49.174
you should be able
to contact the Panic Room
from there.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.347
Good luck, guys.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.401
What do you want
with my son?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.445
I think you already know,
Allison.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.819
You certainly worked
hard enough
to keep it a secret.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.700
You even locked Henry
out of Kim's lab

06:10.787 --> 06:13.199
when you thought
he might figure it out.

06:13.248 --> 06:16.206
Is that why you've done this,
Henry, to get back at me?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.249
Hmm, you know me so well.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.328
Apparently,
I don't know you at all.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.715
He's doing this because
Kevin now embodies
the artifact.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.297
He's the conduit
to the Akashic Field,

06:28.388 --> 06:32.722
and you people are incapable
of handling this kind
of power responsibly.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.051
Spoken by the woman
who's responsible
for Kim's death.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.057
How can you trust her
after what she's done?

06:38.148 --> 06:40.810
Because this is
more important than me,
more important than Kim,

06:40.901 --> 06:42.437
more important
than any of us.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.065
Kevin is connected to
something that needs
to be protected.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.193
There have been only
a few others who could
access the field,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.278
people whose brains
were tuned just right.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.325
A da Vinci, Tesla, Einstein.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.998
Kevin may outshine them all.
We need time with him
to see if we're right.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.241
Well, you have
a lot of time now.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.958
This bunker is stocked
with enough supplies
to last a year.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.247
We're not going anywhere.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.256
Okay, your dad is with
Stark and Taggart.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.508
They had to go
back into G.D.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.964
Oh, my God.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.136
SARAH:
Dr. Fargo '3 at the door.

07:17.979 --> 07:18.968
Hey, Jo.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.430
I thought
you were staying
at Stark's lab?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.105
l was,
but it was kind of
creepy in there,

07:23.193 --> 07:27.402
and I realized I may have
a way to stay in contact with
the sheriff and Dr. Stark.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.359
SARAH's CPU is tied
to my computer at Global.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.198
Down periscope.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.204
That's been here
the whole time?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.407
Did I forget
to mention it?
Yeah.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.121
We use SARAH to slip in
through a back door

07:42.170 --> 07:43.706
to the brain
at G.D.
We?

07:43.797 --> 07:44.957
Once a backdoor
link's established,

07:45.048 --> 07:46.879
there's nothing
in that building
I won't have access to.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.128
I think you mean,
there's nothing
I won't have access to.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.632
Boys, there's plenty of
backdoor access for everyone!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.924
That didn't come out right.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.933
Okay, just make it happen.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.939
NATHAN:
You got anything yet?

08:10.448 --> 08:13.155
Not yet.
This sensor's designed

08:13.910 --> 08:15.650
to detect any known
strain of bacteria,

08:15.745 --> 08:17.997
but if it's a new one,
it may not pick it up.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.330
Very helpful.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.540
CARTER:
I think it's to the left.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.493
NATHAN: I'm pretty sure
it's to the right.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.328
TAGGART: Right ahead, mates.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.675
CARTER: lt's blocked.
We got to go left.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.181
NATHAN: You mean, right.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.682
TAGGART: Not helping.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.564
The bacteria did this?

08:43.648 --> 08:47.732
Well, that was before it found
the iron in our blood
tastier than metal.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.104
Looks like we'll have
to go up over the top.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.401
No, no, no.
We'll be electrocuted.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.603
No, just don't
touch the wires.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.029
Well, we'll have
better access
if we just go under.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.189
Yeah,
and more unstable.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.073
Unstable.
You're unstable, if you
want to go shooting over...

08:56.161 --> 08:57.992
Shut it! Both of you!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.904
You're like
a couple of old women!

09:00.999 --> 09:03.786
l've determined the path
of least resistance.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.882
We're going under.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.545
I love small spaces.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.922
I hate small spaces.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.128
Like returning to the womb.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.884
It's a disturbing thought.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.922
(STRAINING)

09:21.686 --> 09:22.926
We need a bigger womb.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.057
(CREAKING)
That's it.
I'm going up over the top.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.061
(GRUNTING)

09:33.823 --> 09:35.074
(GRUNTING)

09:44.501 --> 09:46.617
Well, that was exciting.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.580
Carter. Thanks.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.257
No problem.

10:02.644 --> 10:06.762
You say that we're not
responsible enough to handle
access to the Akashic Field.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.100
What makes you
any different?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.603
It's not me.
It's the group
I work with.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.767
Who are?

10:11.820 --> 10:15.984
A consortium of people
who have the world's
best interests in mind.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.113
We will give Kevin
all the care and
protection he needs.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.662
Like hell, you Will.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.953
And like I said,
there's no way out of here.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.374
HENRY: You and I both
know that's not true.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.825
There is one way out,
and your security code
can access it.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.547
One way or the other,
we are taking your son.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.469
Communication room's
down past the morgue.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.137
I hate the morgue.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.972
What's wrong, Carter?
You afraid they're
going to wake up?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.149
Yeah, I think they're
going to wake up.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.726
FARGO: Dr. Stark?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.231
NA THAN: Is that you, Fargo?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.983
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yes, sir,
I hacked into...

10:58.032 --> 10:59.283
We hacked into...

10:59.450 --> 11:01.031
The mainframe using SARAH.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.995
Good thinking, Fargo.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.745
Dad, going a bit far
to cancel my party,
don't you think?

11:05.832 --> 11:09.245
You know me.
Three feet, Lucas.
Get your hands off her.

11:09.961 --> 11:10.996
How did he know?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.331
I know everything. Jo?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.292
Hey, what's happening?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.582
We're not sure,
but Beverly's
locked down there,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.213
and she might
be involved.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.668
Hey, Jo.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.588
Hey, uh, Tag.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.681
Tag?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.009
All right, we can
monitor your vitals now,

11:28.104 --> 11:29.810
and help you
navigate the building.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.851
Can you patch us
into the Panic Room?

11:31.941 --> 11:36.230
No, it has an encrypted
protocol that only the D. 0.0.
has an outside access to.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.811
They haven 't been able
to reach them, either.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.149
(SENSOR BEEPING)
What is that?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.939
The sensor that
monitors the suits.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.733
I ’m picking up
the wireless
readings here.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.035
One of you
is loosing pressure.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.113
Better check your suits.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.209
(AIR HISSING SOFTLY)

11:54.339 --> 11:55.545
It's me.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.381
You've been exposed, mate.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.302
Dr. Stark, say something.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.554
I'm headed
to the right place.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.810
NATHAN: You got
the hypodermic laser?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.237
This should
stem the infection.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.360
And if it doesn't?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.566
I'll be a lot thinner.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.651
(LASER WHIRRING)

12:26.913 --> 12:27.902
Ow!

12:28.248 --> 12:29.408
Sorry.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.582
Keep going,
while I still can.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.838
Henry,
you don't want to do this.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.586
You don't want anything bad
to happen to your son,

12:40.677 --> 12:43.919
and you know how this ends,
if you don't cooperate.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.257
So, please.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.239
ALLISON:
I'll be right back, honey.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.455
BEVERLY: What is this place?

13:12.542 --> 13:13.952
HENRY: It's a last resort
escape unit

13:14.002 --> 13:16.084
for the head of G.D.
in case of a security breach.

13:16.129 --> 13:20.293
The S.R.T. Subatomic
Reconstructive Transport.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.134
Teleportation?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.139
But this is
a banned technology.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.965
All active research
was outlawed by
the Stockholm Treaty.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.141
After the prototype
was created.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.843
We never did human trials.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.974
Yet, here it is
at your disposal.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.023
It's interesting how
you can skirt the rules
when it benefits you.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.351
Well, it's not benefiting me
at the moment, is it?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.562
Does the technology
really work?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.238
The last primate trials
were successful.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.989
lt's DNA-specific.
Essentially, it reconstructs
you at a destination point,

13:50.079 --> 13:51.410
leaving your
former body behind

13:51.497 --> 13:53.158
like a snake
shedding its skin.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.489
Where is the destination?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.874
A fully stocked bunker,
one kilometer
outside of town.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.622
But that's
its maximum range.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.663
The greater the distance,
the greater the risk
of complications.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.503
And there were many more
complications after you
left the project.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.883
You want to do this,
be my guest.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.506
God knows how
you'll come out
on the other end.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.888
But there's no way that
I'm letting you put my son
through that thing.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.467
Then say goodbye
to your son now.
It's his only chance.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.187
NATHAN: All right, we're in.
What do we do, now?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.690
ZANE: You should see
a computer console
as you enter the room.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.074
Bring up the Panic Room
intercom link.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.648
That should put you
in direct contact.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.028
Allison, can you hear me?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.073
Allison, are you there?

14:37.168 --> 14:40.501
Hang on.
I'm trying to circumvent
the security wall.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.539
Try now?
Allison?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.507
Something's jamming
the signal.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.221
This is not working.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.421
(ALARM SOUNDING)

14:51.516 --> 14:53.302
Something's working.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.257
Uh-oh.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.222
What? What "uh-oh"?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.767
I think you made it mad.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.643
The security mainframe
is a learning system,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.941
and because of you
it's gone into defense mode.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.360
What? What kind
of defense mode?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.366
That kind.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.567
Move!

15:21.754 --> 15:25.417
That's a motion activated
photon defense ray.
They're screwed.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.089
ALL: We can hear you!

15:27.218 --> 15:28.298
Sorry.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.923
It looks like you can access
the weapon's power supply

15:30.972 --> 15:32.132
through the panel
on the east wall.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.885
And the west wall.
There are two panels.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.141
One mainframe
and a backup power supply.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.470
But you're on your own
with this one. We can't
get through the firewall.

15:40.565 --> 15:41.600
Damn it.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.935
Two panels, three of us.
How hard can that be?

15:44.026 --> 15:48.440
It's a nasty bugger.
lt'll cut us down long
before we reach the panels.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.775
Unless someone
draws its fire.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.485
Why do I always have
to be the someone?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.034
Any day, Carter.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.495
Yeah, you want to
change places?
You just be my guest.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.538
I can't watch this.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.124
Just remember, serpentine.

16:11.012 --> 16:15.130
Three, two,
don't die, one.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.798
(SHOUTING)

16:20.146 --> 16:21.386
NATHAN: I'm here!

16:21.481 --> 16:22.766
TAGGART: I'm halfway!

16:24.942 --> 16:26.682
I said serpentine!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.730
Shut up, Taggart!

16:32.700 --> 16:34.986
CARTER: Running out of
places to hide.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.905
I've got mine, Taggart!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.202
Trying!

16:39.415 --> 16:40.655
Taggart!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.285
I'm trying!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.161
(SCREAMS)

16:49.175 --> 16:50.164
Dad!

16:52.720 --> 16:54.506
I hate this building.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.882
Carter,
you all right?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.088
(GROANING) Yeah.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.557
(CLATTERING)

17:00.186 --> 17:01.346
What now?

17:02.688 --> 17:03.677
Listen.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.808
What is it?

17:06.150 --> 17:09.483
ZANE: Guys, we're picking up
heat signatures down the hall
from you.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.443
Where exactly?

17:11.864 --> 17:12.979
FARGO: In...

17:13.533 --> 17:14.693
In the morgue.

17:15.993 --> 17:20.362
I swear to God, ifthis thing
turns into a zombie attack,
lam quitting.

17:20.915 --> 17:21.904
(GRUNTS)

17:40.643 --> 17:41.758
You ready?

17:41.852 --> 17:45.094
You want every single second.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.727
Is that a yes?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.817
I told you I heard gunfire.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.031
What the hell are
you all doing here?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.072
Well, we were trying to
isolate ourselves from
exposure to the outbreak.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.286
Thanks for opening the door.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.080
You've isolated
yourself in the room

18:12.133 --> 18:14.840
where the flesh-eating
bacteria began.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.754
Flesh-eating?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.423
Flesh-eating.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.799
Is anyone suffering
any ill effects?

18:23.603 --> 18:27.016
No. Flesh seems to be right
where it's supposed to be.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.390
That doesn't make sense.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.937
They should all
look like this by now.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.693
Henry said this was
the first victim.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.284
No way
a bacteria did this.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.863
I'd say acid.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.407
So does this mean
we're good?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.786
No. This means Henry lied.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.372
NATHAN:
About a lot of things.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.382
There isn't a biohazard.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.132
This is a hoax.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.481
Why would Henry lie
about a deadly outbreak?

19:12.526 --> 19:13.652
Get everyone out
of the building.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.476
While he and Beverly
were coming in.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.611
Must have tricked
the computers to think
there was a biothreat.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.238
Fargo, are you still there?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.190
Yeah, we are now,
but the...

19:21.285 --> 19:23.526
The building's security
keeps shutting us out.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.785
What do you see now?

19:27.833 --> 19:31.291
The sensors still detect
the biohazard, and it's
spreading through Global.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.085
That's a problem.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.833
Why? It's not real.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.539
General Mansfield
doesn't know that.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.842
If the system tells him
there's a threat,
he has to trust it.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.090
He'll be forced to follow
all biohazard protocols,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.297
and he will order
a thermal cleaning.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.934
Fargo, try to get through
to him. We got to get
these people out of here.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.180
I can take them, Sheriff.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.306
By yourself?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.722
I think I can handle
a building.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.058
Taggart, this building's
in defense mode.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.813
It's not going to let you
just walk out of here.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.853
| welcome the challenge.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.694
All right, troops,

20:03.619 --> 20:05.200
let's move out!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.320
We are so dead.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.863
TAGGART: I heard that!

20:17.425 --> 20:20.542
I'd like to speak to Kevin,
alone, for a minute.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.712
I'd like you to go straight
to hell. Trade you favors.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.546
We're almost ready.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.137
Henry, what happened to you?
Why are you doing this?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.764
I lost the one person
I truly loved.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.938
Trust me.
That's not something
you want to feel.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.409
There's still one thing
I'm trying to understand.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.447
Just one thing?

20:51.542 --> 20:54.750
Well, you brought
Beverly here
in secret because...

20:55.504 --> 20:57.415
Because you're
a horrible human being.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.088
But why did Allison
go along with it?

21:00.718 --> 21:04.256
Did you ever think maybe
she was trying to protect me?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.303
No, that's not it.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.932
She was trying to
protect Kevin, though.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.936
She said he was changing
and it scared her.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.192
That's why you and she were
working on the dream scanner.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.856
Look, Carter,

21:24.116 --> 21:27.529
Kevin was in Section Five
when the artifact exploded.

21:29.163 --> 21:33.372
We hoped he didn't
get exposed, but he did.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.041
But he didn't
burst into flames...

21:37.588 --> 21:39.294
He's not wired
like anybody else.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.127
In fact, somehow,
he connected to it.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.296
He can control the energy.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.420
And I'm afraid
it's going to destroy him.

21:48.474 --> 21:52.092
That's why I've been doing
everything I can to
disconnect him from it.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.136
Disconnect?
All you ever wanted to do
was connect with it.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.439
Yeah, you're right,
but not at the risk of Kevin.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.934
There's nothing
lwouldn't do for him.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.394
Or Allie.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.105
(BEEPING)

22:10.329 --> 22:13.571
Then, uh, protect them.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.666
Oh, God. Please tell me
you have a plan
to get us out of here?

22:24.718 --> 22:27.175
Relax, mate.
I always have a plan.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.004
So, Fargo, still with us?

22:30.099 --> 22:32.181
Yeah, for the moment, but
the connection's intermittent.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.387
Fargo's your
brilliant plan?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.509
(EXCLAIMS)

22:35.604 --> 22:37.936
Hey, you're lucky
to have me, Larry.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.139
I'm gonna take my chances
flying solo.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.853
Adios, muchachos.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.355
FARGO'S VOICE:
Good, I'd rather let
the computer defenses

22:44.446 --> 22:45.777
take care of you, anyway.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.404
What?
What?

22:47.491 --> 22:49.322
What?
What?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.701
FARGO'S VOICE: Kidding.
We 've contacted Mansﬁeld to
call off the thermal cleaning

22:52.788 --> 22:56.155
and shut down the defenses
in Section Three.
That's your best way out.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.035
I didn't say that.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.207
Well, then, who did?

22:59.253 --> 23:01.915
Damn, this thing's good.

23:02.006 --> 23:06.545
The defense system captured
your voice to mislead them.
They can't hear us anymore.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.212
Don't listen to me!

23:08.304 --> 23:10.135
Fargo, you still there?

23:10.222 --> 23:13.510
Sure am.
You're doing just great.
Not far now, Tag.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.133
Only Jo calls me that.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.264
Fargo, that Zane seems
like a nice enough fella.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.892
He and Jo make a
handsome couple.
Don't you think?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.446
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.646
(SCOFFS TRIUMPHANTLY)
They're repulsive.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.690
The real Fargo
would know that.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.451
You'll never
ﬁnd your way out.
Resistance is futile.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.245
Oh, my God.
We're all gonna die!

23:38.042 --> 23:39.407
Relax, mate.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.744
He's fallen for one of
the classic blunders.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.203
What's that?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.841
Never go in against
an Australian,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.044
when death is on the line.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.252
Huh?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.515
What are you doing?

23:56.602 --> 24:00.470
l've tracked a polar bear
across the Arctic tundra
in a blizzard.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.598
It's all about
the intuition, mate.
This way!

24:05.527 --> 24:07.028
(BANGlNG)
(GROANS) Crikey!

24:07.112 --> 24:08.943
CARTER: | just didn't expect
something like this.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.271
NATHAN: You just
don't know Henry.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.401
Yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.565
He already
shut down Global.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.702
Why would he get himself
locked in a room with Beverly
when there's no way out?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.825
Because there is
a way out.

24:18.916 --> 24:19.905
(SIGHS)

24:20.000 --> 24:21.911
When I first brought Henry
to Eureka, l was working on

24:21.961 --> 24:24.202
a Subatomic Reconstruction
Transport Chamber.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.285
Do I really have to ask?

24:25.381 --> 24:29.465
Teleportation. Basically,
it rebuilds a body
to a new location

24:29.510 --> 24:31.842
using essential
DNA markers.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.470
And one of the byproducts
of the process

24:35.557 --> 24:39.425
is the ability to
filter out contaminants
or health hazards.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.844
What? So if I
go in when I'm sick,
I come out healthy?

24:41.939 --> 24:44.305
Exactly. Oh, no.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.607
Essentially, it could
separate Kevin
from the Akashic Field,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.190
but Kevin's DNA has been
fundamentally altered.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.195
Henry needs both profiles,

24:56.286 --> 24:59.278
but he doesn't have access to
Kevin's original DNA profile.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.243
So what happens if Kevin
goes through now?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.839
Is it me or is it
getting hot in here?

25:07.881 --> 25:09.496
It's the building.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.377
Microwave
antipersonnel defense.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.426
We got to get out of here
before our insides boil.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.221
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.975
Fargo! Fargo, open the door!

25:26.442 --> 25:28.273
How do we shut it off?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.692
I designed it.
I didn't install it.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.478
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

25:34.408 --> 25:35.614
Okay, you've got
to shut it down.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.783
We're trying.
lt's anticipating
every attack.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.610
Then change tactics.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.821
If you've got
a better idea,
I'm all ears.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.244
We have to provide
a DNA profile

25:44.334 --> 25:45.915
for the S.R.T. to build on.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.118
Okay.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.591
Just mine?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.382
No, I'll be doing this
for each of us.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.920
There we go.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.222
So that's me?
That's you.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.722
Yeah, you can hardly see
the cloven hoofs and horns.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.220
You know, I'm really not
the devil, Allison.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.310
If anything, I am trying to
protect Kevin from people
who might be.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.436
What people?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.518
The D.O.D., the C.I.A...

26:13.072 --> 26:16.314
Come on, once they find out
what he can do, and they will,
he will be a lab rat

26:16.408 --> 26:19.275
for the rest of his life.
Is that what you really want?

26:19.369 --> 26:21.860
Do you want to do this
orshaHl?

26:28.295 --> 26:30.377
COMPUTER: Attention!

26:34.093 --> 26:38.257
Attention! Attention!
Intruder alert!

26:45.395 --> 26:49.138
Kevin, honey, remember
the other night
when you read my mind?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.313
Yes.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.015
Can you do it to others?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.568
Can you feel if there are
others coming to help us?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.688
Yes. They're coming.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.195
The computer's
been lying to us.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.621
What if we lie to it?

27:06.667 --> 27:07.873
What do you mean?

27:07.960 --> 27:11.873
Well, its goal is
to eliminate the threat,
so let's do it first.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.953
You want us to kill them?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.879
Just make them appear dead.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.582
Those are their
vital signs, right?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.250
The security system's
picking them up?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.338
ZANE: Yeah, so?

27:19.429 --> 27:21.135
Can you change them?

27:21.181 --> 27:22.682
Maybe we can.

27:23.684 --> 27:28.144
ZOE: You mean, if you make it
think they're already dead,
it'll stop cooking them?

27:28.188 --> 27:29.598
Let's hope.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.398
I've got Dr. Stark's
vitals ready.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.601
And I've got the sheriff's.
So do it.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.738
FARGO: Numbers dropping,
reaching critical.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.820
That's it.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.907
As far as the computer
can tell, they're dead.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.622
It's not working.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.536
Give it a minute.
They don't have a minute!

27:54.631 --> 27:56.667
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

ZOE: (SIGHS lN RELIEF)
Thank you, Jo.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.851
This doesn't mean
we're friends, now,
does it?

28:09.897 --> 28:11.433
Hell, no.
Cool.

Yeah.

Nice invention.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.162
It's time.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.922
Henry, how can you ask me
to do this? He's my son.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.045
I'm asking you
because he's your son.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.671
It's the only way for him.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.898
Don't worry, Kevin.
Everything's going to be okay.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.600
Not for everyone.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.239
I know this is
unbelievably hard,

29:08.288 --> 29:10.244
but you're making
the right choice.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.163
I know I am.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.419
That was the wrong choice.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.430
Stay away from him,
you bitch!

29:31.436 --> 29:32.551

29:37.985 --> 29:39.976
You have no idea
what you are sacrificing.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.776
I know what
I'm not sacrificing.

My son!

29:44.533 --> 29:46.069
Allison, wait!

29:46.410 --> 29:48.776
Henry, you push that button
and I will kill you.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.451
Let me explain.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.950
Why would I trust anything
you have to say?

29:53.041 --> 29:56.033
Mom, wait.
Listen to him.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.335
Please.

of the way down.

Yeah, though, you should
probably let me go first.

I'm not working
with Beverly. There is no
flesh-eating bacteria.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.505
l reprogrammed G.D.'s
security sensor
into thinking there was.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.919
Why?
I knew that you and Nathan

30:49.014 --> 30:50.720
were trying to separate Kevin
from the Akashic Field.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.843
I realized when I saw
the alchemy formula

30:52.934 --> 30:54.799
that the S.R.T. Chamber
was the way to do it.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.263
Why didn't you
say something?

30:56.355 --> 30:59.347
I tried, but you and Nathan
froze me out.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.139
You didn't trust me.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.321
NATHAN: Almost there, Carter.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.327
Never thought
I'd be so relieved

31:18.377 --> 31:20.789
to get to the bottom
of an elevator shaft.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.335
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.214
But I'll feel better
when we get inside.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.631
Hey, Carter,
| just want you to know

31:30.722 --> 31:33.213
I appreciate everything
you've done.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.721
Let's do this.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.223
FARGO:
Only two more firewalls,

31:42.317 --> 31:45.059
and we're in control
of the whole system.

31:49.616 --> 31:53.234
For years, I've wondered what
goes on inside of his head.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.279
Is it what you hoped for?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.446
Better.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.910
I know that he's happy
and that's all
I've ever wanted.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.122
Henry, if this works,

32:08.343 --> 32:10.379
will he be like he is now

32:11.555 --> 32:13.011
or how he used to be?

32:13.098 --> 32:15.430
His autism
is likely to return.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.385
I'll be fine, Mom.
Don't be disappointed.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.063
Honey, it's okay.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.603
All I care about
is that you're safe.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.614
See you in a minute.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.076
BEVERLY: Don't do it, Henry.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.793
We have all the knowledge
of the universe
at our fingertips.

32:44.838 --> 32:48.877
It could be centuries
before someone else
connects to the field.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.630
Think about what this means,
Henry, what we could learn.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.170
It's like you said,
we're not ready.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.888
I can't let you do this.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.934
Or what? You'll do to me
what you did to Kim?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.269
If that's what it takes.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.852
Drop it!

(WEAPON DROPPING)

33:09.404 --> 33:10.905
Henry, not you!

33:13.492 --> 33:14.527
This could save him.

33:14.618 --> 33:17.109
It will kill him.
You don't have all the data!

33:17.162 --> 33:18.823
What are you talking about?
What data?

33:18.914 --> 33:20.450
His KB-201 file.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.741
It has his original DNA.
You need both profiles,

33:23.835 --> 33:25.541
which I would have told you
if you'd bother to come to me.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.085
I did
and you refused my help!

33:27.172 --> 33:28.207
So this is how you
decide to fix it,

33:28.298 --> 33:29.333
to put all these
innocent lives at risk?

33:29.382 --> 33:31.418
And she's how you
decide to fix it?

33:31.510 --> 33:33.501
All right,
this stops now!

33:34.012 --> 33:38.551
Everybody, just take
a breath. This is over.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.804
No, Carter, it's not.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.010
Kevin will die
if! don't do this now.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.390
I've been tracking
his mutations.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.473
The Akashic Field's
taking over his brain.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.858
The only thing Henry's
right about is the S.R.T.

33:49.903 --> 33:52.440
is the way to separate him
from it.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.071
This is your call.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.995
Allie, pull the file.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.547
You all are about
to make a mistake

34:12.634 --> 34:14.590
of biblical proportions.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.839
Wouldn't be the first time.

34:28.066 --> 34:31.558
l've recalibrated
the destination coordinates
right back to this room.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.397
The markers are set.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.688
Let's do this.

Three...

34:42.747 --> 34:44.612
I love you, baby.
...two...

34:44.708 --> 34:46.494
I love you, too, Mom.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.242
...one.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.224
He should be right here.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.760
Where is my son?

35:09.274 --> 35:12.562
Allie, his body might not
have been able to process.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.855
(SOBBING) Oh, no, baby. No!

35:26.833 --> 35:29.825

Mom, where are you?

35:38.928 --> 35:41.465
Oh, you're okay.
Get a blanket.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.298
Here.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.641
NATHAN: We've got to
shut this down,

35:54.736 --> 35:56.818
or there's gonna be
a thermal cleaning.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.146

overriding my control.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.484
(EXCLAIMS) Take that!

36:00.533 --> 36:03.616
General,
you have to believe me.
The virus is a fake,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.324
and there are people inside
who will die if you do this.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.988
You are asking me to trust you

36:08.083 --> 36:11.041
over the most sophisticated
computer system in the world?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.459
I'm asking you
to trust all of us.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.711
Only one firewall left.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.334
You know I want to, Deputy,

36:16.383 --> 36:18.465
but there are strict
protocols in place.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.922
As a soldier,
you should appreciate that.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.798
Great leaders know,
in combat

36:22.847 --> 36:25.259
you sometimes have
to break protocols.

36:25.350 --> 36:29.184
Sir. You of all people
should appreciate that.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.559
It just doesn't make sense.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.891
It's like someone
on the outside is...

all she's got, General.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.201
That's it.
Resetting the system now!

36:53.545 --> 36:54.705
Yes!

36:56.881 --> 36:59.258
Way to stick
to your guns, Deputy.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.382
Well done.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.137
Thank you, sir.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.883
You're amazing.

37:05.932 --> 37:06.921
Thank you.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.765
Ready to get back
to your party again?

37:09.853 --> 37:11.343
I really am.
Yeah.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.012
Not bad.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.805
Not bad, yourself.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.407
You did great.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.333
The system's reset.
Nice work, Fargo.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.581
COMPUTER: S.R. T. transport
sequence initialized.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.370
Beverly, no!
How?

37:40.467 --> 37:43.959
Damn it! Her DNA's already
programmed into the system.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.598
HENRY: She reprogrammed
the coordinates.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.603
She could be anywhere now.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.437
She'll be found.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.102
No, she won't.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.786
And it doesn't matter now.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.507
Holy crap! I did it!

39:09.556 --> 39:10.921
(LAUGHS) Thank you!

39:22.235 --> 39:26.399
Dr. Blake,
are you all right?

39:26.489 --> 39:29.196
Yes, sir.
With everyone's help here.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.653
Where's Beverly Barlowe?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.410
She's dead. Not much left.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.827
And we'll deal
with this internally.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.547
I would love to know who's
responsible for all this.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.337
lam.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.390
Hey.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.267
Hey.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.643
How's Kevin?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.688
Well, he slept till noon,

40:06.738 --> 40:08.979
but he's back
to his old self.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.062
Thanks to you.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.819
I promised you
I'd take care of him.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.242
I'll never be able to
thank you enough, Nathan.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.741
I don't want your thanks,
Allie.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.200
I want you.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.541
I almost lost you both,

40:23.922 --> 40:28.791
and I'm tired of pretending
that I'm okay with us
being apart. I'm not.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.422
Nathan.
You and Kevin
are my family,

40:35.808 --> 40:38.595
and I won't be happy
until we're together.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.180
Marry me, Allie.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.269
Again.

40:53.618 --> 40:54.607
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

40:54.702 --> 40:56.203
Henry?
Jack.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.038
Sergeant.
SERGEANT: Sir.

40:59.958 --> 41:00.947
You ready?

41:01.042 --> 41:03.954
HENRY: As you can see,
my escort's already here.

41:04.003 --> 41:07.666
Yeah, just putting
the last few things in order.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.919
Is there anything
I can do?

41:10.969 --> 41:13.460
No. I mean, they have to
do what they have to do,

41:13.554 --> 41:16.967
because I did what I did,
and I'm willing to pay
the price for it.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.047
Okay.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.550
You know that
you ended up
saving Kevin's life?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.181
I'm sure
they'll take that
into consideration.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.013
But that's not for us
to decide, remember?

41:25.608 --> 41:27.439
No. It's not.

41:29.445 --> 41:30.696
SERGEANT: Sir, it's time.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.026
Well, you're not alone.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.906
You have friends.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.319
Sir?

41:54.846 --> 41:56.382
Right this way.
