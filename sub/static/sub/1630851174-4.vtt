02:59.766 --> 03:01.100
JONATHAN: Everything okay?

03:01.166 --> 03:03.100
Yeah. It's just this fixation on her things.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.366
I mean, it's normal.

03:04.433 --> 03:05.633
Her therapist warned us about it.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.333
I just didn't realize it would be this intense.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.100
Yeah. You know, I'm sure she's gonna feel

03:09.166 --> 03:11.233
so much better once everything's unpacked, and...

03:11.300 --> 03:14.000
Mm-hmm. You don't think I could find an Advil by chance?

03:14.066 --> 03:15.466
I've got such a crazy headache.

03:15.533 --> 03:18.533

03:18.600 --> 03:20.300
MIRA: (SIGHING) Oh, God.

03:22.166 --> 03:23.433
Maybe in the bathroom?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.766
JONATHAN: Is Tylenol okay?

03:25.033 --> 03:26.766
Uh, it'll have to be.

03:27.033 --> 03:30.400
Okay. Here you go. Here.

03:30.466 --> 03:33.133
-Thanks. -You got a migraine?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.266
I don't know yet.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.500
It started in the middle of my meeting with Ackerman.

03:36.566 --> 03:37.566
JONATHAN: Hmm.

03:38.566 --> 03:42.566
Well, Ackerman's a migraine personified.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.466
I don't know about that, you know?

03:44.533 --> 03:46.633
I think it's the stress of having to leave in the middle.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.300
We weren't exactly finished.

03:48.366 --> 03:52.000
JONATHAN: Uh, yeah. Sorry. Couldn't cancel the movers.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.200
Okay. But I'm still just a little unclear

03:54.266 --> 03:55.466
why it had to be today.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.766
Why? Because we agreed to vacate on the 20th.

03:58.033 --> 03:59.533
But why did we agree to vacate on the 20th?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.733
Because I'm leaving on a flight the day after tomorrow.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.733
Yeah, but you're only gone for a week.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.266
Well, nine days, actually.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.600
Okay. So what's the big deal, honey?

04:06.666 --> 04:08.066
-What is it? -Okay, okay, okay.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.500
Let's just get through this, okay?

04:10.566 --> 04:12.633
Okay. Let's go downstairs.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.100
Well, shouldn't we just start here since we're already--

04:15.166 --> 04:16.400
MIRA: No, we can do it later.

04:17.766 --> 04:19.133
Okay.

04:20.466 --> 04:22.700
But wait, wasn't it just supposed to be a week?

04:22.766 --> 04:26.066
I mean, how many lectures are you doing? Just two, no?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.366
Um, well, two in Berlin,

04:27.433 --> 04:28.666
and then there's the panel in Vienna.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.266
-I showed you the itinerary. -Right. Yeah. I just--

04:31.333 --> 04:33.366
I better get used to you traveling so much.

04:33.433 --> 04:36.233
Well, it's not-- it's only my second trip this year.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.366
Yeah. Uh, where are the documents?

04:38.433 --> 04:40.166
-There. -Okay.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.633
It's just this last paper really took off, you know.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.766
-Yeah, it's great. -JONATHAN: Yeah, it's crazy.

04:45.033 --> 04:47.133
Yeah. Okay.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.533
JONATHAN: Okay, yeah, so...

04:49.566 --> 04:51.266
-(SIGHS) -JONATHAN: There you go.

04:53.100 --> 04:58.733
So here is the list of items right here.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.100
MIRA: Mm-hmm.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.033
And here's the settlement itself.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.166
MIRA: Right.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.433
Uh, which is exactly what we agreed to with Jason.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.100
Remember, he sent us the memo?

05:08.166 --> 05:11.100
He emailed it to us last week? Right? Okay?

05:11.166 --> 05:13.300
And the only difference is the amount we got

05:13.366 --> 05:15.266
for the house, split in two, minus the broker's fee.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.700
In the last draft, it was blank.

05:16.766 --> 05:17.766
Okay.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.700
Uh, what is-- What am I supposed to--

05:19.766 --> 05:21.666
JONATHAN: You'll sign by the stickers, and then

05:21.733 --> 05:23.066
-you'll initial each page. -Right.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.366
-JONATHAN: Wait, hold on, hold on. -No, I got it.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.133
Wait, wait. We have to look through all the items

05:26.200 --> 05:27.733
and make sure everything's okay. That's why we're doing it here.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.766
-I'm just not up for this right now, so... -We'll do it really quickly.

05:30.033 --> 05:32.333
We'll just go through it quickly, then you'll sign, and that's it. You'll be done.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.300
You don't even have to wait for the movers, okay?

05:34.366 --> 05:36.733
No, I do. I promised Ava I would be here to put--

05:37.000 --> 05:38.300
make sure her boxes got on the truck.

05:38.366 --> 05:40.266
Well, then you have to wait anyway, right?

05:40.333 --> 05:41.566
So come on. Let's get started.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.166
Okay. Okay. Fine.

05:48.066 --> 05:49.133
(SIGHS)

05:50.333 --> 05:53.266
-So what do the colors mean? -Yeah.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.566
Yellow's mine. Um, red is yours.

05:56.633 --> 05:59.266
-Okay. -Blue is storage.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.433
So they'll pack everything up, and, uh,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.700
then they'll unload at my place first,

06:04.766 --> 06:07.633
then you guys, then the storage facility.

06:08.633 --> 06:09.633
Okay?

06:10.366 --> 06:12.000
Will Poli be home?

06:12.066 --> 06:13.766
Will he be able to help you unpack?

06:14.033 --> 06:15.200
I'm not sure.

06:15.266 --> 06:19.100
Uh-- didn't we say said that I was gonna get the green couch?

06:19.166 --> 06:21.500
Uh, actually, no, we didn't.

06:21.566 --> 06:23.300
We didn't. You said that you didn't want

06:23.366 --> 06:24.533
any of the living room furniture

06:24.600 --> 06:26.100
because you got all new stuff at the tower.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.033
No, I'm pretty sure we talked about the green couch specifi--

06:28.100 --> 06:29.100
-We didn't. -Okay.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.500
Do you want to? You wanna talk about it?

06:30.566 --> 06:32.100
I mean, like formally in the settlement?

06:32.166 --> 06:33.733
MIRA: It's fine. It's just furniture.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
Okay.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.600
JONATHAN: All right. All right. All right.

06:47.133 --> 06:51.066
Okay. There you go.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.266
Happy to do it.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.066
Really. Okay?

06:57.466 --> 06:59.433
How's your headache?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.266
You need to lie down for a moment?

07:01.333 --> 07:02.633
-No. I'm fine. -Okay.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.566
You up for doing this?

07:08.633 --> 07:10.133
We'll just go through the house quickly

07:10.200 --> 07:11.166
-and just get it done? -No.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.600
I'm not up for it, Jonathan.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.300
JONATHAN: But you already wanted to make an adjustment to the thing.

07:14.366 --> 07:15.633
-I just think it's important... -I know. It's okay. I trust you.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
I really do. Just-- you do it. I trust you.

07:19.566 --> 07:20.566
(SIGHS)

07:21.666 --> 07:24.233
Is... is something wrong?

07:25.066 --> 07:27.033
No. It's just, um,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.066
it's been a shitty day, you know?

07:29.133 --> 07:30.200
-Yeah. -It's really--

07:30.266 --> 07:33.066
it's a horrible ending to just a terrible day.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.533
JONATHAN: What's horrible?

07:36.633 --> 07:39.433
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
No, I mean, it is-- it's a-- It is surprising

07:42.566 --> 07:46.366
how something so formal can have such an impact, right?

07:46.433 --> 07:48.300
I mean, it's just a piece of paper,

07:48.366 --> 07:51.100
-just a fucking gett. -MIRA: A "get"?

07:51.166 --> 07:55.033
Yeah. It's, uh, it's Hebrew for divorce papers.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.033
Oh, yeah. I think I remember that.

07:58.366 --> 08:00.300
Although "give" would be more like it.

08:00.366 --> 08:02.466
-(SCOFFS) Yeah. -Give up.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.333
It's Aramaic for deed.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.100
-MIRA: Mm. -It's basically papers

08:07.166 --> 08:09.700
that when I give them to you, we're divorced.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.266
-And that's it? -JONATHAN: Yeah.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.500
Yeah. But it's like-- it's a crazy,

08:15.566 --> 08:17.300
traumatic ceremony.

08:18.433 --> 08:20.600
-There's three judges. -MIRA: Mm-hmm.

08:20.666 --> 08:25.366
And, um, you have to have witnesses

08:25.433 --> 08:28.200
to testify that you are who you say you are

08:28.266 --> 08:31.466
and I am who I say I am. It's humiliating.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.533
-Is it gett with two Ts? -Yeah.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.700
And then you have to go into this little room,

08:35.766 --> 08:37.333
-and there's a guy in there... -MIRA: Uh-huh.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.266
...writing calligraphy on parchment.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.600
And he's writing out the text of the gett.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.300
-Yeah. -JONATHAN: And it's--

08:43.366 --> 08:46.000
it's like a thriller, because the tiniest mistake

08:46.066 --> 08:48.100
and you have to start all over again.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.500
And then, uh, and then you go back in to the judges...

08:50.566 --> 08:52.033
-MIRA: Mm-hmm. -...and the witnesses.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.633
And then I have to hand you the gett in front of everybody

08:54.700 --> 08:58.533
and yell a few sentences at you, and then you hold it up high,

08:58.600 --> 09:00.500
and you walk around the room with it.

09:00.566 --> 09:03.066
And then the judge rips it to pieces.

09:03.133 --> 09:04.366
-And there's more. -Jesus.

09:04.433 --> 09:05.700
JONATHAN: (LAUGHS) Yeah, totally.

09:05.766 --> 09:07.133
Why does it have to be like that?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.266
-Isn't it brutal enough? -Well, I think there's a--

09:09.333 --> 09:11.533
plenty of legal reasons, but I think it just has to be

09:11.600 --> 09:15.666
absolute and definitive. That's the... you know.

09:15.733 --> 09:18.266
-They don't like any gray areas. -Mm.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.600
JONATHAN: You're either in or you're out.

09:19.666 --> 09:23.000
And if you're out... there's no going back.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.700
-MIRA: Right. -There's some logic to that, no?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.100
then we'll just, you know, we'll cut her back down

22:01.166 --> 22:03.366
-to once a week. -Okay. That's fine. Go for it.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.066

24:08.333 --> 24:10.300
We don't even know what's going on.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.633
We just all grow up illiterate about it.

24:22.133 --> 24:24.600
Maybe we should've been more prepared for it.

24:24.666 --> 24:26.700
It's a fact that it doesn't always end up that way.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.700
I mean, it doesn't even usually end up that way.

24:28.766 --> 24:31.300

24:31.366 --> 24:32.500
I don't know.

24:35.500 --> 24:39.733
I think we should teach kids that, yeah, love ends.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.100
It's, uh...

24:42.000 --> 24:43.400
Yeah, relationships end and people leave

24:43.466 --> 24:45.500
and they break up and they divorce.

24:45.566 --> 24:48.366
-And that's just a part of life. -JONATHAN: Yeah.

24:48.433 --> 24:51.600

24:51.666 --> 24:54.533
and, uh, you know, all the suffering.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.366

25:04.433 --> 25:07.533
You know, the limbo, neither here nor there, just...

25:09.200 --> 25:11.766

25:12.033 --> 25:14.266

25:14.333 --> 25:16.500

26:00.233 --> 26:02.133
This isn't about the money, right?

26:03.300 --> 26:05.033
So what is...

26:09.400 --> 26:10.433
I got fired.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.333
JONATHAN: What?

26:13.400 --> 26:16.733
Or I was-- I was invited to resign.

26:18.666 --> 26:21.200
Anyway, it's-- it's over. (CLEARS THROAT)

26:21.266 --> 26:23.033
I don't understand. What do you mean?

26:23.100 --> 26:26.533
MIRA: That's what my meeting with Ackerman today was about.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.066
Oh.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.433
MIRA: Yeah.

26:33.366 --> 26:35.466
(SIGHS)

26:35.533 --> 26:38.766
I mean, it was kind of obvious something like this could happen

26:39.033 --> 26:42.000
ever since I didn't take the London job. I mean, I was...

26:42.066 --> 26:43.766
You were never gonna take the London job.

26:44.033 --> 26:45.633
MIRA: No, that's-- Okay, that's not accurate.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.333
-And there were various options to that. -Mira. No, there--

26:48.400 --> 26:49.733
There was no option, so...

26:50.000 --> 26:53.200
Come on. I'm not blaming you. That's not what this is about.

26:55.466 --> 26:56.766
It's just like, you know,

26:57.033 --> 26:58.766
when I didn't take the job, then...

27:00.700 --> 27:03.400
yeah, they didn't know what to do with me.

27:03.466 --> 27:06.233
Couldn't relocate. I couldn't travel because of Ava.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.100
And, you know, going, uh, back to running

27:09.166 --> 27:10.566
a product management team, it just--

27:10.633 --> 27:12.300
it seemed like a demotion.

27:12.366 --> 27:15.033
So they started shopping me around the company,

27:15.100 --> 27:16.433
to find me a position.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.200
-Nothing clicked. -Yeah.

27:21.433 --> 27:24.566
So this morning, uh, he asked me for a meeting,

27:24.633 --> 27:27.433
which he began by saying,

27:27.500 --> 27:31.200
"Mira, I would like to set you free for a new adventure."

27:31.266 --> 27:33.666
(LAUGHS) Asshole.

27:33.733 --> 27:36.100
I'm like, "I'm 43 and half years old.

27:36.166 --> 27:37.366
I'm one-half of a single parent.

27:37.433 --> 27:40.233
What kind of new adventure do you have in mind?

27:40.300 --> 27:42.400
I mean, tell me the truth. Tell me that you're firing me

27:42.466 --> 27:44.600
because I no longer live for this company,

27:44.666 --> 27:47.433
I'm not at your beck and call 120 percent of the time

27:47.500 --> 27:49.400
like I used to be. You can't ask me to,

27:49.466 --> 27:51.333
you know, go out, entertain the clients anymore

27:51.400 --> 27:54.066
because I'd rather be at home with my kid.

27:54.133 --> 27:56.233
And you know what, maybe the new, young,

27:56.300 --> 27:59.200
ambitious product manager should take them out anyway,

27:59.266 --> 28:01.066
because she's much more fun."

28:06.133 --> 28:08.600
I guess the weird-- I was, uh...

28:12.266 --> 28:15.400
You know, I was sitting across from him and, um,

28:17.233 --> 28:19.133
I could see in his eyes, they were just like

28:19.200 --> 28:20.600
switched off, you know?

28:21.633 --> 28:24.566
I was invisible to him.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.466
I used to have all this power over him.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.033
I could steer him in whatever direction

28:33.100 --> 28:37.333
I wanted him to go, and now I was nothing.

28:41.566 --> 28:44.333
And then I realized that I, um...

28:46.700 --> 28:49.233
I've lost that power over everything.

28:51.733 --> 28:57.433
You know, that power that comes from, um, being desirous.

29:04.433 --> 29:10.100
I sat at the table and I just-- I felt so disposable

29:10.166 --> 29:16.100
and, uh... yeah, so I really, I felt old.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.366
So, that's it.

29:26.433 --> 29:31.766
Yeah, I'm, uh... There's a hearing in two weeks.

29:32.033 --> 29:36.000
I have a severance, there'll be stock options, and...

29:37.600 --> 29:40.366
But that's it. That's-- You know, it's done.

29:50.766 --> 29:52.666
I'm really sorry that happened to you.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.033
(LAUGHS)

30:01.633 --> 30:04.033
You're sorry that happened to me?

30:06.566 --> 30:08.233
JONATHAN: Yeah. Yeah.

30:09.533 --> 30:11.333
Okay. You don't need to be polite.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.533
JONATHAN: No. No. I'm not. I, uh--

30:17.300 --> 30:21.333
But, uh, I, uh, it's...

30:22.233 --> 30:23.266
MIRA: What?

30:25.066 --> 30:26.166
You know, it's weird.

30:28.733 --> 30:30.000
What?

30:33.133 --> 30:35.200
JONATHAN: I'm just-- I'm--

30:37.000 --> 30:39.200
-I'm listening to everything that you're saying... -Uh-huh.

30:39.266 --> 30:40.766
...and it's just-- it's not, uh...

30:43.300 --> 30:44.400
You're right.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.566
If circumstances were different,

30:47.633 --> 30:50.033
I'd be fucking losing my mind right now.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.600
I'd be telling you I was gonna murder Ackerman

30:52.666 --> 30:53.700
-and... -MIRA: Mm-hmm.

30:53.766 --> 30:56.066
...be going crazy with revenge fantasies.

30:56.133 --> 30:57.533
-MIRA: Right. -Yeah.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.166
And I'm listening to you right now,

30:59.233 --> 31:02.266
and I don't... I don't feel...

31:05.066 --> 31:06.133
anything.

31:09.366 --> 31:10.366
Oh, wow.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.733
Well, congratulations.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.333
-I'm sorry. -MIRA: No.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.233
I don't-- I'm not trying to be callous. I'm not.

31:20.300 --> 31:23.033
I know that you're going through a really hard time right now,

31:23.100 --> 31:27.633
-but you asked, and that's... -Yeah.

31:29.166 --> 31:30.533
I'm sharing how I feel.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.433
Well, how you don't feel.

31:39.466 --> 31:40.733
(JONATHAN GROANS)

31:41.000 --> 31:43.133
Half an hour after you were inside me.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.100
-JONATHAN: Yeah. It's a-- -Yeah.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.466
JONATHAN: That was-- That's the weird part.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.600
(CHUCKLES) Uh-huh.

31:52.666 --> 31:56.466
But, honestly, even when we were having sex,

31:56.533 --> 31:59.366
-which was great. It was. -MIRA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.266
-It really was, right? -Yeah.

32:01.333 --> 32:05.500
JONATHAN: And-- there was a part of me that was observing myself

32:05.566 --> 32:08.433
from the outside, checking in to see like how I felt,

32:08.500 --> 32:11.233
how I was feeling. What if this was the last time?

32:11.300 --> 32:13.166
What if I never even see you again?

32:13.233 --> 32:14.700
-MIRA: Mm-hmm. -How do I feel?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.366
Would it be so unbearable? And no,

32:17.433 --> 32:20.233
I realized I could do without it.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.600
-You didn't feel that way? -Mm-mm. No.

32:26.433 --> 32:28.700
Okay, it's just like, I think about it a lot,

32:28.766 --> 32:30.166
-you know? -MIRA: Mm-hmm.

32:30.233 --> 32:33.233
Because I do-- I do think that my...

32:33.300 --> 32:36.366
extreme dependence on you, that that's really what ruined

32:36.433 --> 32:41.000
everything for us beyond repair because that paralyzed me.

32:41.066 --> 32:42.166
Hmm.

32:42.233 --> 32:44.033
The thought of losing you, the fear of losing you,

32:44.100 --> 32:45.500
because that would mean losing everything.

32:45.566 --> 32:48.033
So I'm just saying that, like when we were in the middle

32:48.100 --> 32:49.200
-of that... -Mm-hmm.

32:49.266 --> 32:51.133
...I realized that that fear wasn't there anymore.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.166
That I was free from you at last--

32:53.233 --> 32:54.633
Okay. I don't wanna-- I don't wanna hear anymore.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.166
I mean, it's not really the right time

32:56.233 --> 32:58.033
for a therapy session. You don't have to blurt out

32:58.100 --> 33:00.300
-whatever pops in your head. -Shut the fuck up.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.433
Just shut up.

33:07.066 --> 33:09.266
Like, what... what is this?

33:09.333 --> 33:13.000
What is this sarcasm and this fucking toxic shit?

33:13.066 --> 33:16.466
Who are you to say when the time is right and when the time is wrong?

33:16.533 --> 33:19.166
-Why do you get to decide that? -While you tell me you just fucked me

33:19.233 --> 33:21.366
in order to prove yourself that you don't love me anymore?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.666
I'm trying to talk to you. I'm trying to talk to you.

33:23.733 --> 33:25.366
I'm trying to tell you something about--

33:25.433 --> 33:28.066
No. You're a fucking narcissist. This isn't sharing.

33:28.133 --> 33:30.433
This is you vomiting your stream of consciousness all over me.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.633
You don't give a fuck how it makes me feel.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.166
That is such bullshit.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.400
I-- Mira, there--

33:36.466 --> 33:39.066
I have never had an inch of emotional space

33:39.133 --> 33:41.066
-to share about my feelings with you. -Oh, my God.

33:41.133 --> 33:42.600
If I hear one more word of this psychobabble,

33:42.666 --> 33:45.033
-I'm gonna scream. (LAUGHS) -Well, go ahead, scream.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.000
Scream. You've always been much better at that

33:47.066 --> 33:48.233
than actually communicating,

33:48.300 --> 33:50.100
-than actually having a conversation. -MIRA: Right.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.033
And you're surprised they fired you?

33:52.100 --> 33:53.666
It's a miracle they kept you this long

33:53.733 --> 33:55.200
-when you never learned... -Shut up!

33:55.266 --> 33:57.133
JONATHAN: ...how to actually communicate.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.533
I fucking hate you.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.533
Wow. Okay.

34:04.133 --> 34:06.500
I hate fucking you too, so everything you said just...

34:06.566 --> 34:08.366
Well, you know what, it didn't seem like that

34:08.433 --> 34:10.266
-a second ago, but... -Oh, my God, you moron.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.500
You think because you fucked me like that one time,

34:12.566 --> 34:15.000
-it suddenly makes you-- -Mira, just stop it.

34:15.066 --> 34:16.733
Oh, what? Oh, sorry. God, I said fucked.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.500
I forgot I'm not allowed to say that.

34:18.566 --> 34:21.366
-What are you talking about? -Oh, is it allowed now?

34:21.433 --> 34:24.766
Am I allowed to say cock, pussy, and cum,

34:25.033 --> 34:26.366
and all those bad words

34:26.433 --> 34:28.533
without you, you know, running out of the room?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.000
You are so out of touch with my life.

34:31.066 --> 34:32.266
It's actually really sad.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.533
-MIRA: Oh, really? -Yeah.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.500
MIRA: So all of your religious hang-ups are just like gone?

34:36.566 --> 34:38.133
-What? -'Cause a minute ago, you--

34:38.200 --> 34:40.466
you sprinted to the shower after 'cause, you know, bodily fluids

34:40.533 --> 34:41.766
gross you out. So what's different?

34:42.033 --> 34:43.500
It's actually none of your business.

34:43.566 --> 34:45.333
MIRA: But why? We're sharing, right?

34:45.400 --> 34:48.333
So now I'm gonna share with you how shitty it felt

34:48.400 --> 34:50.233
to pretend like I wasn't a sexual person,

34:50.300 --> 34:52.666
because for you, I knew it would turn you off.

34:52.733 --> 34:55.533
Feeling depraved every time I wanted to fuck you

34:55.600 --> 34:58.100
because for you it was "complicated."

34:59.300 --> 35:00.766
And I tried not to take it personally.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.000
I did. I said, "Okay. It's not about me.

35:03.066 --> 35:05.133
It's who you are. It has to do with you,

35:05.200 --> 35:06.533
-where you're from." -You know what amazes me,

35:06.600 --> 35:08.033
is that I actually really bought it.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.400
I believed you. I believed that I was hopelessly screwed up.

35:10.466 --> 35:11.500
MIRA: Right.

35:11.566 --> 35:13.766
And I could've lived my entire life not realizing

35:14.033 --> 35:16.333
that everything that you've despised me for...

35:16.400 --> 35:17.300
Mm-hmm.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.633
...everything that you hated about me,

35:18.700 --> 35:21.700
somebody else would love me for exactly the same thing.

35:21.766 --> 35:23.733
They would accept me for exactly who I am.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.566
Well, either they're lying or they're very inexperienced.

35:26.633 --> 35:28.766
(SCOFFS) You're so fucking twisted.

35:29.033 --> 35:31.466
You are the most twisted person that I have ever known.

35:31.533 --> 35:34.666
And not a day goes by that I don't thank God...

35:34.733 --> 35:35.733
-Sure. -...that I realized

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
-how amazing sex can be... -Oh, my God.

35:38.066 --> 35:39.366
...and I didn't have to waste my life.

35:39.433 --> 35:41.666
You are the most asexual person I ever met,

35:41.733 --> 35:43.433
and you made a thousand theories to justify it.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.733
JONATHAN: It's true! And you know what, it turns out

35:45.000 --> 35:47.100
all I needed was a woman who actually wanted me as I am.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.633
And I had to teach you everything about sex.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.633
That's exactly right! That's exactly the problem.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.600
You taught me, and you managed me,

35:52.666 --> 35:55.266
and you told me how we would do it and when would do it,

35:55.333 --> 35:56.566
-and everything about it. -MIRA: Oh, my God.

35:56.633 --> 35:58.000
-That's so unreal. -And you'd scold me.

35:58.066 --> 35:59.433
You would scold me like a fucking child.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.433
You know, I think of all the mistakes we've made in our life.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.566
The biggest, that we got together in the first place.

36:03.633 --> 36:06.033
JONATHAN: Okay. Well then, let's fix our mistake.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.600
Let's sign these papers so we can get the fuck out of here.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.600

37:36.200 --> 37:38.400
That's what this is about. What I'm trying to figure out

37:38.466 --> 37:40.500
is if you already knew that before you got here today.

37:40.566 --> 37:42.766
Jonathan, please. My head's pounding. Just...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.066
Will you just say it?

37:51.166 --> 37:54.266
Will you just say it, please? Say it. You don't want to.

37:54.333 --> 37:55.733
-Just say it. -I just can't.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.533
I wanna come home.

38:06.566 --> 38:08.700
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

38:13.166 --> 38:16.233
God, don't look at me like that. I know. I'm just--

38:20.500 --> 38:22.200
I know what this looks like.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.200
(SIGHS) Oh, man.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.333
I don't, like--

38:34.400 --> 38:36.766
MIRA: You can think whatever you want about me.

38:40.433 --> 38:42.233
I guess there's nothing more pathetic

38:42.300 --> 38:44.633
-than what I'm doing now. -Just-- like how do you--

38:46.066 --> 38:48.033
What-- wh-- wh-- what...

38:50.733 --> 38:52.433
How are you not ashamed?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.500
I've never been more ashamed in my whole life.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.533
JONATHAN: I don't-- like--

39:07.700 --> 39:08.766
So...

39:10.133 --> 39:11.466
I don't know. So should I be expecting

39:11.533 --> 39:13.633
another surprise call from Poli?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.300
Does he know that you're here?

39:19.366 --> 39:20.400
Just help me.

39:20.466 --> 39:22.033
Help me understand what your thinking is here.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.566
So if I said, "Okay. Yeah. Great. Let's forget it.

39:24.633 --> 39:26.200
Let's get back together."

39:27.633 --> 39:28.766
You-- what?

39:29.033 --> 39:31.100
You'll go back home to Poli and tell him what exactly?

39:31.166 --> 39:32.233
There's no Poli.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.566
We broke up two weeks ago. It's over. And he's in Tel Aviv.

39:40.766 --> 39:42.066
Okay.

39:45.200 --> 39:49.033
MIRA: I haven't told Ava yet, so please don't say anything to her.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.366
He's gonna come back next week to say goodbye.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.366
I'm gonna, um, pick her up on Wednesday

39:53.433 --> 39:55.266
and we'll tell her together.

39:56.700 --> 40:00.300
Please, please don't do that

40:00.366 --> 40:03.366
unless you're absolutely sure that it's over, okay?

40:04.333 --> 40:05.400
It's over.

40:10.433 --> 40:13.466
Um, you know, for a long time now,

40:13.533 --> 40:17.066
we've been having these really, uh, vicious fights.

40:17.133 --> 40:19.266
After the last time I was here,

40:20.400 --> 40:22.533
he gave me an ultimatum. He said, uh,

40:22.600 --> 40:26.533
either we're having a kid or, um, we're breaking up.

40:26.600 --> 40:30.066
Well, kids, plural. It was not-- it wasn't just one.

40:33.733 --> 40:36.033
And I guess I agreed.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.333
Eventually, I gave in

40:37.400 --> 40:40.533
and we tried for six months, and nothing happened.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.100
Then we went to Dr. Varona, and...

40:43.166 --> 40:48.300
she said that, uh, I should start IVF as soon as--

40:49.533 --> 40:52.366
sooner rather than later 'cause of my age.

40:52.433 --> 40:54.066
And, uh...

40:57.433 --> 41:01.133
somehow I just-- I kept delaying

41:01.200 --> 41:03.233
picking up the prescription.

41:04.700 --> 41:08.166
And, eventually, Poli, he was like, um...

41:10.433 --> 41:12.100
"You don't want this.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.600
It's not happening, and it isn't gonna happen

41:16.666 --> 41:20.700
because, um, you don't wanna have my kid...

41:23.000 --> 41:24.633
'cause you'll always see me as the guy

41:24.700 --> 41:26.166
who broke up your family."

41:31.500 --> 41:36.000
And we went to counseling and on the first session,

41:36.066 --> 41:38.233
the, um, therapist, she-- you know, she asked me

41:38.300 --> 41:40.066
if I thought that, um...

41:45.100 --> 41:47.366
I could ever give up on you.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.433
You know, if I could, um, accept that it was over.

42:02.333 --> 42:05.633
I didn't say anything. And, um, I just--

42:07.266 --> 42:08.733
was just silent.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.166
And in the second session, it was obvious

42:11.233 --> 42:12.500
that the relationship was done,

42:12.566 --> 42:15.433
but it took Poli another week to accept that.

42:21.366 --> 42:23.266
I don't know if you care.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.200
And, yeah, I'm sure you think this is probably

42:27.266 --> 42:28.600
another manipulation.

42:32.266 --> 42:35.533
I'm too tired to try to convince you otherwise, so just...

42:41.033 --> 42:43.666
-do with it what you want. -Do with it what I want?

42:43.733 --> 42:45.000
What-- what--

42:46.300 --> 42:47.666
What do you expect me to do with it?

42:54.166 --> 42:55.200
-JONATHAN: Uh-huh. -I'm not trying to--

42:55.266 --> 42:56.533
I'm not trying to talk you into it,

42:56.600 --> 42:59.266
'cause you've made yourself pretty clear.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.700
I'm just saying that, um...

43:05.633 --> 43:08.133

43:13.200 --> 43:15.766
that has to make a difference, don't you think?

No, I don't think.

43:19.366 --> 43:21.266
MIRA: Why not? Like how can you be so sure?

43:21.333 --> 43:23.766
Because, Mira, you don't want me.

43:24.033 --> 43:26.733
You got fired and you got dumped, and so you just...

43:27.000 --> 43:29.100
No, I didn't-- I didn't get dumped. I just--

43:29.166 --> 43:31.700
You're not listening to me. I just told you what happened.

43:31.766 --> 43:33.233
It doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.400
But why? Why doesn't it matter?

43:34.466 --> 43:36.733
I'm trying to tell you something about how I feel

43:37.000 --> 43:39.366
and about how I felt for you this whole time.

43:39.433 --> 43:41.766
-Mm-hmm. -Like, why doesn't that matter?

43:42.033 --> 43:43.766
And I know that you feel it too.

43:44.033 --> 43:45.533
-I know you do. -Okay.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.466
-And maybe the fact that we haven't been able to... -You don't-- you don't, like--

43:47.533 --> 43:49.566
...extricate ourselves from each other's lives all this time,

43:49.633 --> 43:51.466
I mean, that means-- it means something.

43:51.533 --> 43:55.200
You didn't absorb a single word that I said to you before,

43:55.266 --> 43:57.100
and I don't know how to get it through to you

43:57.166 --> 44:00.300
that I don't have feelings for you anymore.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.600
I don't. I'm sober.

44:03.666 --> 44:06.000
I'm inoculated. That's it.

44:18.333 --> 44:19.633

And, um...

44:21.666 --> 44:25.066
-JONATHAN: Oh, my God -I'm just like asking that,

44:25.133 --> 44:28.033
you know, you just take a second to think about it.

44:28.100 --> 44:31.133
-And I'm not saying it's immediately gonna... -Mira, what the fuck?

44:31.200 --> 44:32.666
But like maybe you-- when you're in Europe.

44:32.733 --> 44:34.100
JONATHAN: What do you think?

44:34.166 --> 44:36.166
You think I'm just gonna throw away all the progress

44:36.233 --> 44:38.033
that I made over the last two years

44:38.100 --> 44:40.533
just 'cause you-- I mean-- (SCOFFS)

44:40.600 --> 44:42.266
You know-- do you wanna something?

44:42.333 --> 44:45.100
You know that there was a period where I started praying?

44:45.166 --> 44:49.700
Like actually praying to God for you to come back?

44:49.766 --> 44:52.733
After you came over to the house that one time and you just--

44:53.000 --> 44:54.033
Yeah!

44:54.766 --> 44:57.133
I was laying right over there with Ava

44:57.200 --> 44:59.033
waiting for her go to sleep,

44:59.100 --> 45:02.533
so that I could talk to you, try to convince you.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.533
And I heard the door slam...

45:06.466 --> 45:08.500
and I wanted to kill you all over again.

45:10.633 --> 45:13.066
And somehow I found myself right here

45:13.133 --> 45:16.166
in the middle of this kitchen, just like with my eyes closed

45:16.233 --> 45:19.566
swaying, praying to God...

45:23.166 --> 45:25.000
that you would come back to me.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.700
(LAUGHS)

45:31.466 --> 45:33.133
So you got me to pray again.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.600
That was unexpected.

45:51.466 --> 45:52.633
Can I have some?

45:54.200 --> 45:56.533
It's pineapple vodka. It's revolting.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.266
I don't know who brought it here.

45:58.333 --> 45:59.400
I can take it.

46:02.333 --> 46:03.333
Thanks.

I have zero interest in my new life. I mean, zero.

47:43.633 --> 47:46.433

-We both have to fight it. -No, we don't.

52:04.166 --> 52:06.333
I've got everything under control here, okay?

52:08.566 --> 52:10.166
(SOBS)

52:14.433 --> 52:16.733
Calm down. Get going, okay?

52:23.733 --> 52:25.366
What about the settlement?

52:28.166 --> 52:30.533
JONATHAN: Forget about the settlement. Let's just toss it.

52:36.433 --> 52:38.666
-But wh-- -It's not important. I--

52:43.033 --> 52:44.666
It's not worth it.

52:44.733 --> 52:46.666
It was-- it was important, but--

52:46.733 --> 52:49.133
to get it done today, but, uh, not at this cost.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.033
But why was it so important to you?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.466
JONATHAN: Doesn't matter now.

53:01.533 --> 53:03.733
Just tell me. Please.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.100
Just say it. Why?

53:11.500 --> 53:18.000
Well, I thought that maybe I wanted to have another kid.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.566
(MIRA GRUNTS)

53:26.700 --> 53:28.500
JONATHAN: Suddenly I realized that it's the thing

53:28.566 --> 53:30.633
that brings me the most joy in my life.

53:33.466 --> 53:34.633
I'm good at it.

53:36.433 --> 53:38.400
I want Ava to have a sibling.

53:41.433 --> 53:44.466
And I'm not willing to wait for the love of my life

53:45.433 --> 53:46.600
or whatever.

53:51.166 --> 53:53.366
And in therapy, it came up, actually,

53:53.433 --> 53:56.100
that having another kid was more important to me

53:56.166 --> 53:58.300
than having another partner.

54:02.166 --> 54:06.533
And I was having lunch with, uh, Celia Patterson,

54:06.600 --> 54:08.133
-from my department? -MIRA: Mm.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.666
Her and her girlfriend just split up and, uh...

54:11.700 --> 54:14.466
Well, it came up that she was in the process

54:14.533 --> 54:16.133
of looking for a partner,

54:16.633 --> 54:19.233
a man, for, um...

54:21.200 --> 54:22.566
What's it called? Um...

54:24.600 --> 54:28.500
Elective co-parenting, which-- yeah.

54:28.566 --> 54:31.666
And kind of as a joke, she was like,

54:31.733 --> 54:34.000
"You'd be perfect. What about you?"

54:38.566 --> 54:41.333
So you're gonna have a kid with Celia Patterson?

54:41.400 --> 54:43.033
JONATHAN: I don't know. Maybe.

54:44.566 --> 54:46.266
I mean, not necessarily her.

54:46.333 --> 54:48.333
But it's a-- it's a cleaner situation

54:48.400 --> 54:54.133
to go into that arrangement officially divorced.

54:59.700 --> 55:02.700
But I'm not gonna put that stress on you right now.

55:02.766 --> 55:05.200
-No. -JONATHAN: No. I mean...

55:07.033 --> 55:08.433
it's not really...

55:11.733 --> 55:14.733
I'm just asking, you know?

55:18.000 --> 55:19.500
All this thinking, you know, you've been doing

55:19.566 --> 55:21.766
about having a kid with whoever...

55:23.133 --> 55:24.366
Um...

55:28.266 --> 55:30.333
Even occur to you to have it with me?

55:33.466 --> 55:34.466
With you?

55:37.100 --> 55:38.300
(CHUCKLES)

55:40.000 --> 55:44.033
Honestly, it never occurred to me that you would want to.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.033
MIRA: Why not?

55:48.666 --> 55:50.100
-Why not? -Yeah.

55:50.166 --> 55:52.200
Are you punishing me for the abortion?

55:52.266 --> 55:55.733
JONATHAN: Mira, what? No. What are you talking about? I--

55:57.433 --> 55:59.333
There's nothing that would make me believe

55:59.400 --> 56:01.733
-that you would want to. -But I would.

56:04.366 --> 56:05.466
I mean, I'm not gonna--

56:05.533 --> 56:08.066
I'm not gonna say that we made a mistake back then.

56:08.133 --> 56:10.033
I didn't think we could handle it,

56:10.100 --> 56:11.366
you know, back then.

56:13.300 --> 56:16.000
I didn't think our marriage could survive another kid.

56:16.066 --> 56:18.133
I know. Joke's on me. (CHUCKLES)

56:19.666 --> 56:21.633
But that's the truth, so...

56:22.700 --> 56:23.666
JONATHAN: I believe you.

56:23.733 --> 56:25.700
And we're in a different place now.

56:25.766 --> 56:27.033
-Yeah. -MIRA: Yeah.

56:27.100 --> 56:28.233
Yeah. We're in a different place.

56:28.300 --> 56:31.033
We're not the same people. You know, we're not, uh,

56:32.133 --> 56:33.600
young anymore. We're not...

56:33.666 --> 56:35.066
You mean, I'm not young anymore?

56:35.133 --> 56:37.266
-No. That's not what I said. -MIRA: That's what you meant.

56:37.333 --> 56:39.366
-JONATHAN: No. No. That's not... -Yeah.

56:39.433 --> 56:41.633
No, that's-- it's not about you at all, Mira.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.533
-MIRA: Okay. -What I'm trying to do is see

56:43.600 --> 56:46.066
if there's a way to undo this paradigm

56:46.133 --> 56:51.066
where having a kid is bound to having a romantic partner

56:51.133 --> 56:52.766
because then maybe I'd be free to think about...

56:53.033 --> 56:55.466
Free to keep fucking around and still get to have a kid?

56:55.533 --> 56:57.133
Is that the idea? No?

56:57.200 --> 56:59.333
'Cause it's wrapped up in so much psychological bullshit,

56:59.400 --> 57:01.066
I'm still trying-- I'm just trying to understand

57:01.133 --> 57:03.600
what you're actually saying. Is it that your successful therapy

57:03.666 --> 57:05.566
has turned you into an egocentric asshole

57:05.633 --> 57:07.600
who, you know, just does whatever the fuck he feels like...

57:07.666 --> 57:10.266
-Okay. We're done. -...and then doesn't even--

57:22.333 --> 57:23.300

57:23.366 --> 57:25.100
Otherwise, I'm sure you can handle it.

57:41.566 --> 57:43.200
I'm really strung out, okay?

57:43.266 --> 57:44.533
JONATHAN: It's okay. I understand.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.166
Okay. We can't end it like this.

57:46.233 --> 57:47.733
I mean, you can't just leave, okay?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.500
Jonathan, listen, you can't drop a bomb like that

57:50.566 --> 57:51.566
and just leave.

57:51.633 --> 57:53.466
-Okay, we'll do it another time. -No. No.

57:53.533 --> 57:55.633
-We're gonna talk about it right now. Right now. -Mira, you need to calm down.

57:55.700 --> 57:57.433
-Mira, let me go. -Because this affects all of our lives.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.566
-It affects Ava's life. -I'm done. I'm done, okay?

57:59.633 --> 58:01.700

58:01.766 --> 58:04.700
Just-- I'm not gonna let it end like this, okay?

58:06.766 --> 58:08.066
Please. I'm really sorry.

58:11.566 --> 58:12.733

58:13.000 --> 58:14.200
-All right. Let me go now. -Okay. Okay.

58:14.266 --> 58:16.133
