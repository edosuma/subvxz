another case of swamp ass.

00:24.205 --> 00:26.264
Another case?

00:26.265 --> 00:28.756
Yeah, it happens every year
around this time.

Apparently, I ran a red
light at 64 miles an hour.

02:30.673 --> 02:32.807
And I was in
the passenger seat.

02:34.009 --> 02:36.109
Yes, I was driving,

02:36.110 --> 02:38.144
therefore you were in
the passenger seat.

02:40.714 --> 02:41.880
Anyway, it turns out

02:41.881 --> 02:44.417
I had a couple of
unpaid parking tickets.

02:44.418 --> 02:46.819
Seventeen.

02:46.820 --> 02:47.987
Thank you.

02:47.988 --> 02:50.223
They arrested you
for unpaid parking tickets?

02:50.224 --> 02:52.326
Well, there was also
a bench warrant

02:52.327 --> 02:53.895
when I didn't show up in court.

02:53.896 --> 02:55.698
Well, how could you not
show up in court?

Don't they send
you a summons?

02:57.670 --> 03:00.205
Lots of them,
but I threw them away.

03:01.941 --> 03:04.676
I thought they were
for jury duty.

03:05.878 --> 03:07.578
Long story short,
when I didn't show up,

03:07.579 --> 03:09.046
they suspended my license.

03:09.047 --> 03:11.983
And I was in the passenger seat.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.886
So you were driving
with a suspended license?

03:14.887 --> 03:18.189
Only for a couple of years.

03:19.624 --> 03:20.824
Luckily though,
my license was fine,

03:20.825 --> 03:22.659
so when they took him
to the police station,

03:22.660 --> 03:23.693
I followed in the Mercedes.

03:23.694 --> 03:24.827
By the way,

03:24.828 --> 03:27.363
I reset all your radio stations
to good stuff.

03:27.364 --> 03:29.732

03:29.733 --> 03:30.866

03:30.867 --> 03:32.301
You've been through a lot.

03:32.302 --> 03:35.170
By the way, if you need anyone
to drive you to the movies

03:35.171 --> 03:37.472
or the mall or a strip club,
I'm available.

03:37.473 --> 03:39.274
Appreciate it.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.042
And you can just relax
in the passenger seat,

03:41.043 --> 03:42.944

03:42.945 --> 03:44.879

03:47.382 --> 03:50.518

that you lost your license,

03:50.519 --> 03:53.153

if I did not point out

03:53.154 --> 03:54.988

you're setting for Jake.

I brought the ice.

10:00.301 --> 10:01.301
Oh!

10:03.103 --> 10:05.538
I guess the bottom got wet.
You know how that is.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.808
I mean, because, you know,
it happens to everybody,

10:08.809 --> 10:09.909
not because you're gay.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.445
And I thought
you were exaggerating.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.548

A birthday present for Chelsea.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.427
But you guys broke up.

10:29.428 --> 10:32.263
Yeah, well, I bought it
a couple of months ago.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.164
Why?
'Cause I thought

10:34.165 --> 10:35.632
that's when her birthday was.

10:36.967 --> 10:40.336
Turns out, I confused it
with St. Patrick's Day.

10:40.337 --> 10:42.171
Are those real diamonds?

10:42.172 --> 10:43.572
Yep.

10:43.573 --> 10:44.739
Burn.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.608
What?

10:46.609 --> 10:50.177
You could've saved a lot of
money with Cuban zirconium.

10:52.046 --> 10:53.780
Cuban zirconium?

10:53.781 --> 10:55.981
Yeah.

10:55.982 --> 10:58.083
'cause it's just
as sparkly as a diamond,

10:58.084 --> 11:00.919
and it's cheap
'cause it's from Cuba.

11:03.289 --> 11:05.322
Good Lord, you're an idiot.

11:05.323 --> 11:07.657
Hey, I'm not the one
who wasted a bunch of money

11:07.658 --> 11:09.725
on a bralet for a girl
who dumped me.

11:09.726 --> 11:11.160
It's not a waste.

11:11.161 --> 11:12.995
I'm still going to give it
to her.

11:14.830 --> 11:16.898
In fact...

11:16.899 --> 11:19.067
comen, you're driving
me to Chelsea's.

11:19.068 --> 11:21.568
Did it occur to you
that I might have plans?

11:21.569 --> 11:22.969
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.637
Do you have plans?

11:24.638 --> 11:26.772
No, but there's
a principle involved.

11:28.239 --> 11:29.769
I'm just saying,
there's a right way,

Birthday card for Chelsea.

Oh. Good idea.

12:13.784 --> 12:15.284
Look at this one.

12:15.285 --> 12:16.786
Says, "I got you
a birthday package."

12:16.787 --> 12:18.487
And on the inside,
it's a naked fat guy

12:18.488 --> 12:20.456
with a hole for you
to pop your finger through.

12:20.457 --> 12:22.724
Mm, no.

12:22.725 --> 12:24.226
Are you sure?

12:24.227 --> 12:26.494
He really likes you.

12:32.866 --> 12:34.996
Here we go.

12:34.997 --> 12:37.398
"Wishing you all the
dreams of your heart,

in the world

12:38.834 --> 12:40.335

day you deserve

12:40.336 --> 12:41.737
for being so special."

12:41.738 --> 12:43.905
That's not funny.

12:43.906 --> 12:45.707
Not supposed to be funny.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.909
Yeah, well,
mission accomplished.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.578
Look at this one.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.180
It's an old lady
with long banana boobs

12:53.181 --> 12:54.481
and a dog looking at her.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.983
And on the inside, isays,
"How many were in your litter?"

12:56.984 --> 12:58.951
That's not a
birthday card.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.153
It could be.
Write "happy birthday" inside.

13:02.789 --> 13:04.789
I need a real
birthday card.

13:04.790 --> 13:06.724
Okay.

13:07.626 --> 13:10.661
Here's one
with a puppy on it.

13:10.662 --> 13:13.363
"For someone very special
on her birthday.

13:13.364 --> 13:15.998
Each day is a beautiful
gift to enjoy."

13:15.999 --> 13:17.299
That's pretty good.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.367
Yeah, and then you
could cut a hole

13:19.368 --> 13:22.836
and pop your pinky through
and give that dog a bone.

13:25.206 --> 13:28.540
I can't help you if you're not
going to work with me.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.679
I'm really glad
you came, Alan.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.048
How could I not?

13:37.049 --> 13:38.416
We're friends.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.052
I know, but I was afraid it
might be uncomfortable for you.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.753
No, no. Don't be silly.

13:43.754 --> 13:46.522
So, uh, that's it?

13:46.523 --> 13:48.156
No dinner? Just finger foods?

13:48.157 --> 13:49.658
Sorry.

13:49.659 --> 13:51.026
Oh, no, it's fine.

13:51.027 --> 13:53.228
I could never have enough
prosciutto and melon.

13:53.229 --> 13:56.663
Oh. Hey, that'd be a good
name for a singing act.

13:56.664 --> 13:58.565
Prosciutto and Melon.

13:58.566 --> 14:00.300
"Ladies and gentlemen,

14:00.301 --> 14:03.737
the song stylings of
Prosciutto and Melon."

14:05.873 --> 14:08.309
There's an open mic night
at the senior center.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.743
I'm going to use that.

14:09.744 --> 14:11.745
Terrific.

14:12.746 --> 14:13.646
So, how's he doing?

14:13.647 --> 14:15.715
Who?
Alan.

14:15.716 --> 14:17.184
Oh, oh, Charlie.

14:17.185 --> 14:19.218
Uh, uh, he's doing fine--
just fine.

14:19.219 --> 14:21.854
Good, good.

14:21.855 --> 14:24.825
In fact, he told me to
tell you happy birthday.

14:24.826 --> 14:26.926
Oh, that's nice.
Tell him I said thanks.

14:26.927 --> 14:28.361
I will.

14:28.362 --> 14:30.529
And I'm sure he'd say,
"You're welcome."

14:34.267 --> 14:36.501
So, um, how are
you doing?

14:36.502 --> 14:38.436
And it's me asking,
not Charlie.

14:38.437 --> 14:39.870
Although I'm sure he'd
be interested.

14:39.871 --> 14:42.005
Not that I'd tell him,
unless you want me to.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.339
Do you want me to? Wait.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.774
Tell me how you're doing first,
and then we can decide.

14:47.010 --> 14:48.710
I'm doing fine, Alan.

14:48.711 --> 14:50.812
Good, good. Oh, so is Charlie.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.047
Can we change the subject?

14:53.048 --> 14:55.783
You're the one
who brought it up, but sure.

15:00.321 --> 15:03.589
You ever think about your
dad and Ed having sex?

15:05.892 --> 15:08.160
"Happy birthday,
thinking of you."

15:09.495 --> 15:11.095
What's wrong with it?

15:11.096 --> 15:13.664
It's, what to you call it,
redumbnent.

15:13.665 --> 15:16.066
Redumbnent?

15:16.067 --> 15:19.936
Yeah. You got her a present
and you got her a birthday card.

15:19.937 --> 15:21.571
You're obviously
thinking of her.

15:21.572 --> 15:24.407
So <i>saying</i> you're thinking
of her is redumbnent.

15:24.408 --> 15:26.308
So if you act like a moron,

15:26.309 --> 15:29.578
<i>saying</i> you're a moron
would be redumbnent.

15:29.579 --> 15:30.879
Now you're getting it.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.614
Oh, buddy, you really
shouldn't be walking around

15:33.615 --> 15:35.349
without a helmet.

15:35.350 --> 15:37.351
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

15:37.352 --> 15:39.086
Why can't I
go with you?

15:39.087 --> 15:41.821
Because I'm just
gonna give Chelsea
the bracelet and leave.

15:41.822 --> 15:43.723
Bring me back
a piece of cake.

15:43.724 --> 15:47.125
Corner with a flower
would be nice.

say, "Happy birthday,
this is from Uncle Charlie,"

16:43.408 --> 16:45.175

16:53.516 --> 16:55.284

16:55.285 --> 16:57.219
Well, at the risk
of being redumbnent,

16:57.220 --> 16:59.554
I'm saying I'll
be having cake.

17:02.357 --> 17:05.858

blackmailed by Forrest Gump.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.394

waiting out here?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.496
No! Are you nuts?

17:10.497 --> 17:13.932
