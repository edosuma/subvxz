That way,

He does.

Then it's settled.

You take Squishy

19:54.917 --> 19:56.709
a little silly now, huh?

19:56.750 --> 19:58.375
- I'm feeling

19:56.750 --> 19:58.375
a little something.

19:58.417 --> 19:59.667
I'm going to get some tea.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.792
- [sighs]

20:05.834 --> 20:09.000
- So how was date night?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.834
- Why is there a dog

20:09.041 --> 20:12.834
in our cupboard?

20:12.875 --> 20:16.792
- Uh, there's a logical

20:12.875 --> 20:16.792
explanation for that.

20:16.834 --> 20:22.000
- Yeah, it's not like we had

20:16.834 --> 20:22.000
some big dog party in here.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.709
[nervous laughter]

20:28.417 --> 20:29.375
- What?

20:29.417 --> 20:32.417
[dogs barking]

20:32.458 --> 20:34.834
So you did have

20:32.458 --> 20:34.834
a big dog party.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.917
[barking]

20:37.959 --> 20:39.709
A very big dog party.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.375
- Okay, technically,

20:39.750 --> 20:42.375
it was Squishy's party.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.709
- After he ran out the doggy

20:42.417 --> 20:44.709
door, dug under the fence,

20:44.750 --> 20:47.333
and went to El Pepper Pot,

20:44.750 --> 20:47.333
they followed him back here.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.625
Ricky, Nicky, and Dawn: Dicky!

20:48.667 --> 20:50.709
- Squishy was in

20:48.667 --> 20:50.709
El Pepper Pot?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.792
- Just until

20:50.750 --> 20:51.792
we got him out.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.041
Ricky, Nicky, and Dawn: Dicky!

20:53.083 --> 20:54.750
- You were in

20:53.083 --> 20:54.750
El Pepper Pot?

20:54.792 --> 20:59.041
- Well, I guess I didn't do this

20:54.792 --> 20:59.041
to myself for no reason.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.125
Oh, who's my little

20:59.083 --> 21:01.125
cup of tea?

21:01.166 --> 21:03.959
Yes, you are.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.709
- So any chance

21:04.000 --> 21:06.709
this will affect

21:06.750 --> 21:08.375
you letting us stay

21:06.750 --> 21:08.375
home alone again?

21:08.417 --> 21:11.500
- Hmm, well, there is a dog

21:08.417 --> 21:11.500
licking guac off my shoe,

21:11.542 --> 21:14.083
so I'm thinking we're

21:11.542 --> 21:14.083
going back to the babysitter.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.291
all:<i> The babysitter.</i>

21:16.333 --> 21:18.166
- Ahh, the babysitter.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.250
- Please get the dogs

21:18.208 --> 21:20.250
out of the house.

21:20.291 --> 21:22.125
- Take care of Chamomile for me.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.875
- Don't worry.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.875
Captain Dicky has a plan.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.083
- No.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.500
Every time one of us

21:28.125 --> 21:29.500
tries to be the leader,

21:29.542 --> 21:30.959
it just makes things worse.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.417
- She's right.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.208
- Yeah, we always

21:32.458 --> 21:34.208
work best as a team.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.041
- So let's do this.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.333
Come on, pups.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.834
- Come on, boy.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.834
Come on.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.917
- Me first.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.917
- Ow.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.417
- Me.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.417
- No, me!

21:43.458 --> 21:44.542
[all yelling]

21:44.583 --> 21:46.083
- Guys, stop.

21:46.125 --> 21:51.083
I may not be the captain,

21:46.125 --> 21:51.083
but we know what we have to do.
