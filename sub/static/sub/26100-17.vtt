WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:01.709
Previously on "God Friended me"...

00:01.710 --> 00:02.719
I appreciate you not mentioning

00:02.719 --> 00:04.059
the whole God Account thing.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.240
Yeah, you know, it was
never my story to tell.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.609
Lester and the board requested

00:07.610 --> 00:09.800
that I come to Harlem
Episcopal to replace you.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.400
I'm being pushed out? Is that it?

00:11.410 --> 00:12.779
Arthur, they're nominating you

00:12.780 --> 00:14.660
to become Bishop of New York.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.920
I've been looking for
someone like you, Rakesh.

00:16.940 --> 00:18.740
Someone who could kind
of be my right hand.

00:18.770 --> 00:21.009
You said it from the beginning, Miles.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.560
You weren't chosen at random.

00:22.570 --> 00:23.799
You just need to find the connection

00:23.800 --> 00:25.960
between you and Simon Hayes.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.960
Come on, you have to
kiss her. It's bad luck.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.960 --> 00:45.259
So FreeVerse only hosts
11 shows, but 2 of them

00:45.260 --> 00:48.200
made iTunes top 100, so who knows?

00:48.210 --> 00:50.599
Maybe after this meeting
The Millennial Prophet

00:50.600 --> 00:52.420
will make that list, too.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.509
- What?
- Who are you?

00:54.510 --> 00:56.850
Bro, the Miles I know would
be worried about everything

00:56.860 --> 00:58.699
that could go wrong and
prepare himself for,

00:58.700 --> 00:59.780
like, disappointment.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.320
Okay, well, what can I say?

01:01.350 --> 01:03.239
I am in a positive state of mind.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.440
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.199
Even after your disaster
of a date with Cara?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said
it was ever a disaster?

01:08.350 --> 01:11.759
Uh, you did, unless I'm
missing something.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.769
Well, you know, my friend,

01:12.770 --> 01:15.859
a gentleman never kisses and tells.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.599
You kissed?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.620
Miles, this is huge!
Miles, that's great!

01:19.630 --> 01:21.940
Okay, yes, yes, we kissed, but we're...

01:21.960 --> 01:24.580
we're taking our time, okay?
Seeing what happens.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.939
Okay, you've been taking your
time for a couple months now.

01:26.940 --> 01:29.509
I suggest speeding things up a little.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.539
You know what? I know,
we should go, like,

01:31.540 --> 01:33.540
on a double date when Jaya comes back.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.879
One step at a time, Rakesh. I gotta go.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.480
I'm meeting the head of FreeVerse here.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.640
All right-y, good luck, man.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.820
I apologize for not getting
back to you sooner.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.300
We get hundreds of podcast
submissions every month,

01:46.310 --> 01:47.599
and I listen to all of them.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.400
Wow, that is dedication.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.740
I think FreeVerse can put

01:50.750 --> 01:52.359
The Millennial Prophet on the map.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.069
Just like Serial did for
This American Life.

01:55.070 --> 01:57.440
Well, that sounds great.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.160
But there's just one thing.

01:59.170 --> 02:01.939
Look, I've been down this road before,

02:01.940 --> 02:04.039
okay, and I know that at a certain point

02:04.040 --> 02:05.879
someone's gonna ask me
to change my message.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.349
I won't.

02:07.350 --> 02:10.400
You've got lightning in a bottle, Miles.

02:10.419 --> 02:13.149
We can't pay you much, and you'd
have to record from home.

02:13.150 --> 02:16.840
But the upside is, no one is
looking over your shoulder.

02:16.850 --> 02:19.459
The only thing we ask for in
return is that we maintain

02:19.460 --> 02:21.659
exclusive rights to our
shows and content.

02:21.660 --> 02:24.359
We wouldn't want anyone else
talking about The God Account.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.180
Other than that, you run your show.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.699
I, um...

02:30.700 --> 02:32.660
I... I don't know what to say.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.320
Say you'll think about it.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.479
"That's Amore." I love that song.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.279
Didn't know it was a make-out song.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.620
Okay, we didn't make out.
What are you, like, 12?

02:44.630 --> 02:46.779
In times like this I
tend to revert back.

02:46.780 --> 02:49.340
- I need details.
- Like, what?

02:49.350 --> 02:50.939
Like, how was the kiss?

02:50.940 --> 02:52.860
Are you going out again?
How was the kiss?

02:52.880 --> 02:55.200
Okay, all right. The kiss was...

02:56.240 --> 02:58.529
Pretty great.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.469
And, yes, we're going out again,

03:00.470 --> 03:04.179
but we both just feel like
this is something special

03:04.180 --> 03:07.419
and we don't see the upside
in rushing into anything.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.769
Okay...

03:08.770 --> 03:11.420
This is a nice office. Quaint.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.479
Mr. Hughes.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.479
- So nice to meet you. I'm...
- Cara Bloom. Yes, I know.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.820
Did you think I walked
in here by mistake?

03:17.850 --> 03:19.620
Well, I thought it was a possibility.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.189
It wasn't.

03:21.190 --> 03:23.169
I've been meaning to swing
by to meet the journalist

03:23.170 --> 03:25.700
who turned down the big job in features.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.880
Not a bad way to catch the boss' eye.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.099
Thank you?

03:30.100 --> 03:33.169
- We should talk.
- Y... yeah, do you wanna...

03:33.170 --> 03:35.080
No, I meant lunch.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.350
- Tomorrow.
- Sure.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.399
Do you mind telling me
what this is about?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.269
Ah, what fun would that be?

03:42.270 --> 03:43.799
My assistant, Lydia, will be in touch

03:43.800 --> 03:45.980
with the details. See you then.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.879
Uh, the editor-in-chief of "Catapult"

03:49.880 --> 03:51.060
just asked you to lunch.

03:51.070 --> 03:53.720
Yeah, question is why?

03:56.880 --> 03:59.199
They have an area for the Civil War

03:59.200 --> 04:00.429
and all the uniforms.

04:00.430 --> 04:03.110
- They have a planetarium.
- What?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.819
And they have a whole
wing just for dinosaurs.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.100
Wow.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.820
The only problem is, the
field trip costs $40.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.240
I... I don't need to go.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.180
Know what? You're gonna go.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.839
It's a lot of money.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.179
Well, it's a good thing that, uh,

04:23.180 --> 04:25.520
I got the job interview tomorrow.

04:28.140 --> 04:31.019
And once you get the job we
can move into our castle

04:31.020 --> 04:32.040
and raise our flag.

04:37.670 --> 04:40.899
Assuming we make it out
of here in one piece.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.440
Did you hear that?

04:43.460 --> 04:46.809
Dragons. Don't worry.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.060
The king must be protected!

04:50.070 --> 04:51.860
I am the dragon slayer!

04:54.880 --> 04:58.040
- Oh, man, that was close.
- Sorry about that.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.360
No, no, they don't
usually come down here.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.520
How do you know?

05:02.530 --> 05:04.120
I, too, am a dragon slayer.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.940
But shh. Don't tell anyone.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.740
I have to keep my identity a secret.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.259
Hey, this is our stop, buddy.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.329
How about you and I go to Metro Diner.

05:14.330 --> 05:15.639
Celebrate my interview.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.650
- Yes!
- Yeah?

05:16.660 --> 05:17.880
- All right.
- And don't worry.

05:17.890 --> 05:19.460
Your secret's safe with me.

05:19.470 --> 05:22.209
I appreciate it.

05:22.210 --> 05:24.339
Oh, hey. Good luck tomorrow.

05:24.340 --> 05:25.609
Thank you!

05:27.460 --> 05:30.220

05:43.720 --> 05:45.760
Congratulations again, Arthur.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.769
We couldn't be prouder of
your nomination for bishop.

05:48.770 --> 05:49.839
Thank you.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.570
Like any election, Arthur,

05:51.580 --> 05:53.620
there's a political side in all of this.

05:53.630 --> 05:56.239
Which is why Lester asked me
to come in and talk to you.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.779
You know, hoping my PR experience

05:57.780 --> 06:00.259
might help to avoid any pitfalls.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.949
I admit, this is all

06:01.950 --> 06:04.520
very new to me so any
advice is appreciated.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.199
During the walkabouts you'll be meeting

06:07.200 --> 06:08.849
and answering questions
with parishioners

06:08.850 --> 06:10.900
from every voting parish in the city.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.719
I look forward to the challenge.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.180
Good.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.829
But there are sensitive topics.

06:16.830 --> 06:18.899
Topics you want to, uh,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.500
pivot away from if they come up.

06:21.470 --> 06:23.439
Uh-huh.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.039
I see.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.270
You mean, uh,

06:27.280 --> 06:30.499
my son who is an atheist and
my daughter who is gay.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.820
Are these the pitfalls
we're talking about?

06:32.850 --> 06:34.439
We're talking about concentrating

06:34.440 --> 06:36.199
on all the wonderful
things you've done here

06:36.200 --> 06:37.800
at Harlem Episcopal.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.439
Making sure that's what people
take away from your candidacy.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.439
I understand, but a lot of
the work that I've done here

06:43.440 --> 06:45.039
is to make the church more inclusive

06:45.040 --> 06:46.359
to everyone.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.500
I assumed that that was a big part

06:48.520 --> 06:49.929
of why the diocese chose me.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.040
It is.

06:51.050 --> 06:53.529
And if you become bishop,

06:53.530 --> 06:55.680
think of how much more you can do.

06:55.690 --> 06:58.120
Mm-hmm.

07:00.630 --> 07:03.120
I mean, they seem really happy.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.180
Any idea why the God
Account sent you his name?

07:05.190 --> 07:07.299
Nope. All I know so far

07:07.300 --> 07:09.530
is that he has a job interview tomorrow

07:09.540 --> 07:11.160
that he seems pretty excited about.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.900
Okay, so maybe we're supposed
to help him with his interview?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.159
Maybe.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.930
Speaking of interviews,

07:16.940 --> 07:18.260
how did your meeting with FreeVerse go?

07:18.300 --> 07:22.039
They love my podcast and they
don't want to change a thing.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.479
That's great.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.249
See, I knew it was just a matter of time

07:25.250 --> 07:27.220
before someone realized
how amazing you are.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.760
Um...

07:32.770 --> 07:34.220
There is one thing.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.960
They want exclusivity.

07:38.230 --> 07:39.690
Well, I write about the people we help,

07:39.700 --> 07:40.999
not the God Account.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.280
That's the deal. Nothing's changed.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.080
- I just wanted to make sure.
- Okay.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.540
So did you say yes?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.920
Not yet, but I think I'm going to?

07:49.960 --> 07:53.400
All right, so dinner and
drinks to celebrate?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.140
Wait, you mean, like, a second date?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.460
Yeah, exactly.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.519
Oh, uh,

08:02.520 --> 08:04.460
I actually might have
some news of my own.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.830
Um, I got invited to lunch

08:07.840 --> 08:09.499
with the editor-in-chief of "Catapult."

08:09.500 --> 08:11.029
Way to bury the lead.

08:11.030 --> 08:15.040
Actually, the lead is, I have
no idea what it's about.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.399
- Hey, they're leaving.
- Yeah, let's go.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.000
Hey, it's only 7:30. We
still got a half hour.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.509
It's a temporary no parking zone.

08:27.510 --> 08:28.540
Hey, hey, hey.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.150
Why don't you just give the guy a break?

08:30.740 --> 08:32.578
Sorry, it's out of my hands.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.019
Hey, it's the dragon slayer!

08:34.020 --> 08:35.580
You can pick it up at the impound.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.448
No, please, listen.
You don't understand.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.318
You can't tow my car.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.900
Okay, so there's nothing we can do?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.259
- It's out of my hands.
- Come on, man.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.159
We can work something out!

08:46.160 --> 08:49.059
Hey, we can work something out!

08:51.130 --> 08:52.299
Hey, man, let us help.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.520
How about I call you a
Lyft to take you home?

08:56.400 --> 08:58.460
That is our home.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.760
It's $400.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.929
What am I gonna do? I can't afford this.

09:11.930 --> 09:14.780
Hey is... is there anyone you can call?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.080
Family, maybe?

09:17.340 --> 09:19.770
No, no.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.530
Since my wife died it's just,
uh, it's just Max and me.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.099
Where are we gonna sleep, Dad?

09:24.100 --> 09:25.650
We're gonna figure something out, buddy.

09:25.660 --> 09:26.740
Come on.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.499
You know what? I'm gonna call us a Lyft,

09:29.500 --> 09:30.899
we're gonna go down to the impound lot,

09:30.900 --> 09:32.420
and I'm gonna get the car out for you.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.100
You don't even know us.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.080
True, but, um,

09:38.100 --> 09:40.549
us dragon slayers

09:40.550 --> 09:42.060
have to stick together, right?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.549
Hey, look, I, uh, I
appreciate the offer,

09:44.550 --> 09:46.460
but I don't... I don't take handouts.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.390
On the train I overheard
you saying that you have

09:49.400 --> 09:50.859
- a job interview tomorrow.
- Yeah.

09:50.860 --> 09:53.729
After you get that job you pay me back.

09:53.730 --> 09:55.380
It's a loan. Don't worry about it.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.629
Look, it's gonna drop
below freezing tonight.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.359
All right, I'm gonna pay you back.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.359
I'm sure you will.

10:10.290 --> 10:13.580
Hey, are you ready? I am starving.

10:15.980 --> 10:19.800
Yeah, let me just, uh, grab my coat.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.180
Everything okay?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.339
I, uh, I met with Lester

10:25.340 --> 10:27.110
and one of the other board members

10:27.120 --> 10:28.879
to talk about election strategy.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.239
And it didn't go well?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.809
They suggested that it might be best

10:31.810 --> 10:34.050
if I pretended not to
have an atheist son

10:34.060 --> 10:35.549
and a gay daughter.

10:35.550 --> 10:36.980
- What?
- Mm.

10:36.990 --> 10:38.000
They said that?

10:38.020 --> 10:41.589
They used the word, "pivot," but...

10:41.590 --> 10:43.020
the message was clear.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.780
I'm just disappointed.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.439
Wait, are you thinking about
withdrawing your name?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.860
I told Lester that I needed
more time to think about it.

10:55.670 --> 10:57.640
Well, have you spoken
with Miles and Ali?

10:57.660 --> 11:00.439
- No.
- Well,

11:00.440 --> 11:03.219
this is a really big decision, Arthur.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.679
Now, don't you think the two people

11:04.680 --> 11:06.520
at the center of it should weigh in?

11:08.020 --> 11:09.440
Hm.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.279
Wait, excuse me! Come on, Max.

11:16.280 --> 11:20.260
Hey, listen. I'm here to pick up my car.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.320
We open at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.469
Happy to help you then.

11:23.470 --> 11:25.519
Wait, is there any
possible way we could just

11:25.520 --> 11:27.340
pay for it real quick?
It's very important.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.400
Sorry, I already shut down the office.

11:29.410 --> 11:31.560
Promised my kids that
I'd get home early.

11:31.570 --> 11:34.199
Listen, I got an interview tomorrow.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.320
Okay? So can I at least
grab my suit from the car?

11:36.340 --> 11:38.419
Hey, you said you have kids,

11:38.420 --> 11:41.119
right? Father to father.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.400
I need this job, man.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.359
You've got five minutes.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.839
- All right.
- Back lot.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.000
- I'm gonna help look.
- Okay, can you watch Max?

11:51.080 --> 11:53.499
- Yeah, no problem.
- Dad, don't forget the flag!

11:53.500 --> 11:55.199
All right, buddy!

11:55.200 --> 11:57.220
Hey, what flag?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.439
My mom and I made it before she died.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.069
It has our family crest sewn into it.

12:02.070 --> 12:03.440
You know what those are?

12:03.450 --> 12:06.610
I do, but I don't think
I've ever met anyone

12:06.620 --> 12:08.560
that had one. Very fancy.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.219
Every castle has one and so will ours

12:11.220 --> 12:12.960
once my dad gets that job.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.640
Max seems like an amazing kid.

12:16.650 --> 12:18.619
He is. You know, I don't think

12:18.620 --> 12:20.250
most kids could handle
what he's been through

12:20.260 --> 12:23.250
and still get excited
over dragons and flags.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.889
Well, that's because he has a great dad.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.729
- Ah, there we are.
- Oh.

12:27.730 --> 12:31.000
Well, thank you, but that's all his mom.

12:31.020 --> 12:34.069
You know, with Annie,

12:34.070 --> 12:36.700
a ride on the subway could
turn into a hunt for spies.

12:36.740 --> 12:40.279
Castle forts in the living
room on a rainy day.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.320
I miss that.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.540
How long has it been?

12:45.600 --> 12:48.319
A little over a year.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.580
It's cancer.

12:50.620 --> 12:54.200
Even with insurance the bills
started to pile up fast.

12:54.220 --> 12:58.770
After she passed, my
company was downsizing,

12:58.780 --> 13:00.629
so I was let go.

13:00.630 --> 13:01.999
Dominoes,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.299
boy, they started to fall fast, then.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.700
I am so sorry, man.

13:07.700 --> 13:11.240
I pick up any odd jobs I can.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.179
But with nobody to help me with Max,

13:15.180 --> 13:17.010
my hours are limited.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.860
That's why I need this job.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.540
Hey, does...

13:23.620 --> 13:26.139
does that flag have anything
to do with the game

13:26.140 --> 13:27.700
that you two were playing on the train?

13:29.340 --> 13:32.829
Yeah, my wife came up with it,

13:32.830 --> 13:34.220
when she first got sick.

13:34.930 --> 13:39.099
I just know that playing it helps Max to

13:39.100 --> 13:41.900
keep his mind off of our reality.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.500
That's all that really matters to me.

13:46.560 --> 13:51.779
My father is the Reverend
at Harlem Episcopal.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.249
Let me give him a call.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.180
Maybe you two can stay at the shelter.

13:55.220 --> 13:58.689
Thank you, but, so far

13:58.690 --> 14:01.259
I've been able to shield
Max from that, so

14:01.260 --> 14:03.220
I'm just gonna figure
something else out.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.400
- Well, how about my place?
- Like I said,

14:05.410 --> 14:07.699
- I don't accept charity.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.220
No, my friend, it is not charity.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.460
I am protecting my investment.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.440
If you want to pay me back

14:14.520 --> 14:16.480
you have to get that job.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.560
And for that, you need
a good night's sleep.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.400
Max was out before I even
turned off the light.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.980
He hasn't slept in a
real bed in months, so,

14:30.990 --> 14:32.080
thank you.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.160
Happy to help.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.360
I should get some rest.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.170
Good night.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.709
Good luck tomorrow.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.080
Thank you.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.320
You did a good thing, Miles.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.189
I hope so.

14:48.190 --> 14:52.019
You know, I think that
once he gets this job,

14:52.020 --> 14:53.820
things are gonna turn around for them.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.620
Yeah, me too.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.459
- I should take off.
- Okay.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.080
Good night.

15:07.110 --> 15:10.240
Good night.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.120
Miles?

15:17.620 --> 15:18.979
Miles?

15:18.980 --> 15:20.139
Hey, guys.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.980
Rakesh, what are you doing here?

15:23.990 --> 15:25.290
Dude, I just can't find

15:25.300 --> 15:27.180
a connection between you and Simon.

15:27.930 --> 15:30.940
So you came all the way down
here just to tell us that?

15:37.240 --> 15:39.739
Oh, oops, um.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.460
Um, my bad. I should have called.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.279
This is, uh...

15:44.280 --> 15:46.809
This is new territory for all of us.

15:46.810 --> 15:49.480
- Just saying.
- Rakesh, just continue,

15:49.490 --> 15:51.000
- please.
- Okay.

15:51.020 --> 15:54.079
Um, so I have been looking

15:54.080 --> 15:56.740
at your travel history,
social media footprint,

15:56.770 --> 15:59.290
- credit card charges...
- Wait, wait, you looking

15:59.300 --> 16:00.989
- at my credit card charges?
- Of course, yeah.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.020
Kudos on your credit score, by the way.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.350
Um, point is,

16:04.360 --> 16:06.499
there has to be someone out there

16:06.500 --> 16:08.840
who could connect Simon
and the God account.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.680
- Okay, like who?
- Like, your dad.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.039
No, Rakesh, trust me.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.760
My dad does not know Simon Hayes.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.450
Yeah, not personally.

16:17.460 --> 16:18.679
Doesn't mean there isn't something

16:18.680 --> 16:21.649
- that could connect them.
- I mean, you gotta admit,

16:21.650 --> 16:23.579
your dad and his church have played

16:23.580 --> 16:25.279
a pretty big role in all of this.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.589
I guess it's possible.

16:26.590 --> 16:28.149
A bunch of our Friend Suggestions

16:28.150 --> 16:29.589
have had ties at Harlem Episcopal.

16:29.590 --> 16:32.460
My Uncle T, Rachel, Aaron Booker, Heidi.

16:32.470 --> 16:33.479
Mm-hmm.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.729
So, think it's okay if I
talk to him about this?

16:35.730 --> 16:37.699
About finding a connection between him

16:37.700 --> 16:40.770
and the God Account? Yeah, good luck.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.819
I'm gonna pay you back, Miles.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.599
- Nah.
- No, no, no.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.899
I give you my word.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.880
I don't doubt that for a second.

16:47.890 --> 16:51.409
Hey, that suit screams
experienced office worker

16:51.410 --> 16:54.750
with attention to detail
and good people skills.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.919
Well, I do hope the HR
person agrees with you.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.489
Trust me, I'm sure they will.

17:00.490 --> 17:01.580
Thank you, Miles.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.459
Hello?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.098
Yes.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.868
He is. You sure?

17:17.240 --> 17:20.640
No, no, no, no, I'm just, uh...

17:21.869 --> 17:23.520
Okay. Okay, thank you.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.119
That was Max's school.

17:27.140 --> 17:28.959
He, uh... he's sick.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.360
So they need me to come and get him.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.279
Wait, you mean right now?

17:32.280 --> 17:34.079
I mean, your job interview
is across town.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.640
There's no way you're gonna
make it there in time.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.040
You know what?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.489
How about I pick him up. No problem.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.329
You're not on the pickup list.

17:41.330 --> 17:42.380
They'll only release him to me.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.860
Hey, but don't worry about it.

17:43.890 --> 17:46.399
Okay? I'll race down there, grab Max,

17:46.400 --> 17:49.060
and hopefully they'll see
me if I'm not too late.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.600
There must be something I can do.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.209
Appreciate you, Miles.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.040
You've done enough.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.300
Thanks again.

18:06.060 --> 18:09.220
Last call for Ben Evans.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.559
Ben Evans.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.430
Right here!

18:15.400 --> 18:17.099
I'm Ben Evans.

18:22.570 --> 18:25.140
- Thanks for coming in, Mr. Evans.
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.899
I have to admit, you're
younger than I expected.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.550
Yes, I get that a lot.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.349
I just mean, considering you
served two tours in Iraq.

18:34.350 --> 18:37.289
Did you join the army
right out of high school?

18:37.290 --> 18:39.389
Okay, yeah, um...

18:39.390 --> 18:43.629
I'm gonna have to be
completely honest with you.

18:43.630 --> 18:45.299
I'm not Ben.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.120
- Excuse me?
- I'm a friend of Ben's.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.750
Okay, he's running late, his
son got sick at school,

18:50.770 --> 18:51.999
and he had to go pick him up.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.300
And he asked you to come down
here and take his place?

18:57.080 --> 19:00.909
Well, actually, no, that
was more of my idea,

19:00.910 --> 19:03.120
which now I'm realizing

19:03.140 --> 19:05.160
I probably should have
given it more thought.

19:05.170 --> 19:07.540
Look, I appreciate you trying
to help your friend out,

19:07.560 --> 19:09.219
but I have a very busy
day, and have to move on

19:09.220 --> 19:11.589
- to the next interview.
- And I get that. I do.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.859
But you're not gonna find
a better candidate, okay?

19:13.860 --> 19:16.160
It's for a office manager, right?

19:16.170 --> 19:17.659
- That's correct.
- Okay, which means

19:17.660 --> 19:19.340
you're gonna need someone
who is a people person,

19:19.360 --> 19:21.770
Someone who is positive.
Someone who can find

19:21.780 --> 19:23.399
creative ways to keep people engaged

19:23.400 --> 19:26.169
no matter how bad the situation.

19:26.170 --> 19:29.139
And trust me, that's Ben.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.240
Miles, what are you doing here?

19:33.880 --> 19:37.119
Your friend just made a
very compelling argument

19:37.120 --> 19:38.820
for why I shouldn't move on.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.660
Have a seat. Let's talk.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.879
Hey, uh, Max is in the lobby.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.229
Would you mind sticking around?

19:51.230 --> 19:52.780
Not at all.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.860
So Cara,

20:01.880 --> 20:04.279
I'm excited to finally get the chance

20:04.280 --> 20:06.280
to sit down with one of my star writers.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.509
Thank you.

20:08.510 --> 20:09.899
I've read all your articles.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.449
They're incredibly engaging.

20:11.450 --> 20:15.119
It's like Humans of New
York meets Grand Design.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.540
Plus, they feel personal.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.780
Yeah, well, I've gotten to know

20:22.820 --> 20:25.130
everyone I've written about,
spent time with them.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.919
So yeah, it is personal.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.300
If you don't mind me asking,

20:29.320 --> 20:30.400
where are you finding them?

20:31.690 --> 20:35.389
What I mean is, these
people you're profiling,

20:35.390 --> 20:36.900
They don't seem random.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.580
Well, a good journalist
never reveals their source.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.240
Right.

20:44.140 --> 20:46.380
You remind me of myself 20 years ago.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.900
Always in search of
that next great story.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.469
You know, the thing is,

20:52.470 --> 20:55.009
the desire to find it,

20:55.010 --> 20:56.380
it never leaves you.

20:57.010 --> 20:58.320
For example,

20:58.350 --> 21:01.099
I recently came across
a fascinating podcast.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.419
It's called The Millennial Prophet.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.419
Have you heard about it?

21:08.420 --> 21:11.259
No. Is it any good?

21:11.260 --> 21:13.459
Oh, it's addictive.

21:13.460 --> 21:17.199
It's about an atheist who's
friended by somebody

21:17.200 --> 21:20.469
claiming to be God on Facebook.

21:20.470 --> 21:23.439
And they send him Friend Suggestions

21:23.440 --> 21:26.009
of people in need of help.

21:26.010 --> 21:29.909
People just like the ones
you're writing about.

21:34.450 --> 21:37.100
So that's what this lunch is about?

21:37.110 --> 21:38.790
Yeah.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.270
See, I figured out where you
were getting your stories,

21:41.280 --> 21:44.229
but what I can't figure out
is why you're not writing

21:44.230 --> 21:47.599
the most important one.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.819
I mean, who's behind the God Account.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.400
Well, it's not my story to tell.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.499
According to his podcast,

21:53.500 --> 21:56.869
you guys are close to
uncovering God's identity.

21:56.870 --> 21:57.879
Is that true?

21:57.880 --> 22:00.740
Well, we do have two
pretty strong suspects.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.579
Two? I've only heard of Henry Chase.

22:03.580 --> 22:04.799
Who's the other one?

22:08.620 --> 22:10.580
You'll have to keep
listening to find out.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.220
I'd rather read about it.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.680
A story like that

22:15.700 --> 22:17.780
could put you on the map.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.029
How are you feeling, Max?
You feeling better?

22:24.030 --> 22:25.180
A little bit.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.900
I just hope I didn't mess
up my dad's interview.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.960
No, no, no, no. You didn't.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.460
You know what? In fact,

22:31.570 --> 22:33.239
I have a good feeling about it.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.409
Like there's someone out there
who really wants your dad

22:36.410 --> 22:37.440
to get the job.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.280
- Thanks, Miles.
- And when that happens,

22:40.300 --> 22:42.732
you can finally move into your castle

22:42.733 --> 22:43.949
and hang your flag.

22:43.950 --> 22:46.140
That's the plan.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.760
Too bad there's no real
castles in New York.

22:48.820 --> 22:52.289
What? Who told you that?

22:52.290 --> 22:54.220
Nah.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.460
Look.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.100
You see that?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.100
That castle is in New York City.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.690
Snug Harbor.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.890
My mom, she used to take
me there when I was a kid.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.390
We would climb to the top of the castle

23:11.400 --> 23:13.900
and look over the whole city.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.030
You still go there with her?

23:19.550 --> 23:23.640
Actually, she died when
I was about your age.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.899
But the memories we made

23:29.900 --> 23:33.740
are still with me, and they never leave.

23:38.860 --> 23:40.600
So?

23:42.740 --> 23:44.379
I got it.

23:46.010 --> 23:47.579
Congratulations.

23:47.580 --> 23:50.119
Listen, I owe it all to you, Miles.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.119
When I get my first pay check,

23:52.120 --> 23:53.850
I'll pay you back for the impound.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.359
There is no rush, okay?

23:55.360 --> 23:56.820
Once you get settled,

23:56.850 --> 23:59.759
in your new castle with Max,

23:59.760 --> 24:00.980
you can pay me back.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.460
- That's a deal.
- Congratulations.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.239
Rakesh? Come on in.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.959
To what do I owe the honor?

24:13.960 --> 24:15.499
Uh, I was just hoping you had a minute

24:15.500 --> 24:16.930
to talk if that's all right?

24:16.940 --> 24:18.420
Absolutely. Please, sit down.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.019
So, what's on your mind?

24:25.020 --> 24:27.179
God.

24:27.180 --> 24:29.660
Well, not your God,

24:29.680 --> 24:33.120
or my God, or, anyone else's God.

24:33.130 --> 24:35.180
Uh, if there is a God.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.250
No, um, I'm... I'm here

24:37.260 --> 24:39.429
- about the God Account.
- Huh.

24:39.430 --> 24:41.819
I'm trying to find a connection
between Miles and the person

24:41.820 --> 24:43.550
we believe is behind the God Account.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.020
Oh, who's that?

24:45.080 --> 24:46.160
Simon Hayes.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.529
I thought maybe you two
were connected, or...

24:49.530 --> 24:51.439
at least your paths have crossed.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.329
Well, no, they haven't.

24:53.330 --> 24:54.469
I think I would remember

24:54.470 --> 24:57.939
a famous tech billionaire
at Sunday services.

24:57.940 --> 25:00.239
Yeah.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.969
Kind of a long shot, I know.

25:01.970 --> 25:04.410
You know, Rakesh, um...

25:05.760 --> 25:08.749
The bible is filled with stories of God

25:08.750 --> 25:10.879
choosing people to do his work,

25:10.880 --> 25:14.400
but why he chose them is not
the important question.

25:15.420 --> 25:19.400
But rather, the people
they're asked to help.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.389
You mean our Friend Suggestions?

25:21.390 --> 25:22.720
Mm.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.269
So do you really think Simon Hayes

25:27.270 --> 25:29.399
has a personal connection
to our Friend Suggestions?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.439
Uh, that's what I'm gonna find out.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.850
Trying to create an algorithm
to see if any of them

25:33.860 --> 25:35.760
- ever crossed paths with him.
- Hm.

25:35.770 --> 25:37.139
Speaking of, how's it going with Ben?

25:37.140 --> 25:39.009
Oh, great. He got the job.

25:39.010 --> 25:40.879
What? He did? Why didn't you tell me?

25:40.880 --> 25:42.950
I didn't want to
interrupt your big lunch

25:42.960 --> 25:44.449
with your editor-in-chief.

25:44.450 --> 25:46.219
Hey, how did that go by the way?

25:46.220 --> 25:47.630
Eh, fine. Good.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.919
He just wanted to talk about a story.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.539
- No big deal.
- Are you kidding?

25:51.540 --> 25:52.959
That's a huge deal.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.980
Yeah, he's right. What...
what's the story about?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.860
No, it doesn't matter.
It's not right for me.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.400
So tell me about Ben's job.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.379
Well, he starts work
on Monday which means

26:02.380 --> 26:03.399
he can finally afford a place

26:03.400 --> 26:05.540
which means our work here is done.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.640
- Almost done.
- Hm?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.150
Oh, Max's flag.

26:10.170 --> 26:11.939
He must have left it here by accident.

26:11.940 --> 26:14.480
Uh, Ben said that he was
going to park his minivan

26:14.500 --> 26:16.160
in Morningside Heights. Let's go.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.500
Max.

26:20.510 --> 26:22.840
Dad, I'm really proud of you.

26:26.690 --> 26:28.280
We'll be in our castle in no time.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.800
Can I help you, Officer?

26:48.760 --> 26:51.520
Sir, please step outside the van.

26:51.550 --> 26:53.950
We need to talk.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.199
Can I ask what the problem is, Officer?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.499
Yeah, I noticed you and your son

27:01.500 --> 27:03.449
get into that van a few hours ago.

27:03.450 --> 27:06.689
When I realized you hadn't
moved or left I got concerned.

27:06.690 --> 27:09.259
Now I can see why. You're living in it.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.680
- This is just temporary.
- Temporary or not,

27:11.700 --> 27:13.589
I've got to report this
to Social Services.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.259
Okay, wait, uh, please, just...

27:15.260 --> 27:17.829
Listen, if you report me,
they'll take my son away.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.799
All right, and I just got a job.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.799
We're only in this van
until I find a new place.

27:22.800 --> 27:27.320
Hey, um, excuse me. Ben,
is everything okay?

27:28.260 --> 27:29.680
Look, Officer.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.539
This is my friend, Miles.

27:31.540 --> 27:32.839
Okay? He can vouch for me

27:32.840 --> 27:34.299
about the job I was just talking about.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.539
Look, I appreciate the
situation you're in,

27:36.540 --> 27:37.819
but I got to report it.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.119
What if we can guarantee

27:39.120 --> 27:40.320
a roof over his head tonight?

27:40.340 --> 27:41.720
Yeah, they can stay with me.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.229
Okay, look, I... I get it, I get it.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.140
You're very skeptical of me,

27:47.160 --> 27:50.300
but my dad is the Reverend
at Harlem Episcopal,

27:50.320 --> 27:51.470
and he has a shelter there.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.279
He works with Social
Services all the time.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.279
Your father is Reverend Finer?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.620
Yeah, do you know him?

27:56.680 --> 27:58.249
Yeah, I saw him speak

27:58.250 --> 28:00.860
at the Widows and Children's
fundraiser last year.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.440
Yeah!

28:04.980 --> 28:06.899
I tell you what.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.340
You get your father on the phone

28:08.350 --> 28:09.680
to verify what you're saying,

28:09.700 --> 28:12.500
and I'll let them stay together.

28:12.510 --> 28:14.879
- Provided it's at the shelter.
- Absolutely.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.980
And you still have to
report to Social Services

28:17.000 --> 28:18.979
Monday morning to prove your employment,

28:18.980 --> 28:20.920
and that you have a
long-term housing situation.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.830
- Yes, sir.
- All right, now.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.219
I made arrangements for you and
Max to stay at the shelter

28:28.220 --> 28:29.599
until you find something permanent.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.740
I also made calls

28:30.750 --> 28:32.780
to some low income housing in the area

28:32.800 --> 28:34.320
that you can afford with your new job.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.699
Dad?

28:36.700 --> 28:39.980
Are we gonna sleep in here
with all these people?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.060
Yes we are, but it's okay

28:42.080 --> 28:44.500
because they're looking for
a castle just like us.

28:44.520 --> 28:48.380
There might even be some
dragon slayers among them.

28:51.940 --> 28:54.139
You know what? He's right.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.109
This church is over 100 years old,

28:56.110 --> 28:58.940
and it's always been a safe
haven for dragon slayers,

28:58.960 --> 29:00.660
so you have nothing to worry about.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.389
- 100 years old?
- Mm-hmm.

29:02.390 --> 29:03.640
Whoa.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.919
I bet you could even
pick out your own bed.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.589
Absolutely.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.729
I don't know what to say.

29:13.730 --> 29:16.240
You and your son's generosity,

29:16.260 --> 29:17.380
it's a godsend.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.450
Well, we certainly know that these days

29:20.460 --> 29:22.780
it's easier than ever
to fall on hard times.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.369
Yeah, when you have a run of bad luck

29:24.370 --> 29:26.250
you start to wonder if
it's ever gonna work out.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.320
But ever since meeting Miles and Cara,

29:30.640 --> 29:33.980
things finally seem to be
heading in the right direction.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.720
Miles got you working
on a Friend Suggestion?

29:37.740 --> 29:39.789
Not quite. I'm trying to connect

29:39.790 --> 29:41.889
all of our Friend
Suggestions to Simon Hayes

29:41.890 --> 29:43.000
so I can finally prove

29:43.010 --> 29:46.129
that his top secret project
is the God Account.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.060
Why not just wait until
he shows it to you.

29:48.070 --> 29:51.050
If you're running his
team, he can't keep you

29:51.060 --> 29:52.140
in the dark about it forever.

29:52.180 --> 29:54.200
The thing is, Ali,

29:54.250 --> 29:56.320
I don't know if I am running his team.

29:56.330 --> 29:57.399
What are you talking about?

29:57.400 --> 29:58.759
All right, so last week

29:58.760 --> 30:00.019
when you came to IdentitySeal,

30:00.020 --> 30:02.059
I discovered that Henry
Chase was trying to destroy

30:02.060 --> 30:03.799
the server that the top
secret project was on.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.740
I was able to stop him when I created

30:05.770 --> 30:07.829
this new security system that basically

30:07.830 --> 30:09.880
kept him out for good.

30:09.970 --> 30:11.899
Now I think that that's all

30:11.900 --> 30:14.019
Simon Hayes ever wanted from me.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.660
At least, that's how I've been feeling.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.360
What if you're wrong?

30:20.370 --> 30:23.299
What if everything he told you was true?

30:23.300 --> 30:24.360
Why risk it?

30:24.370 --> 30:27.280
Because I have to know.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.319
That he's behind the God Account?

30:29.320 --> 30:31.899
Or that you don't deserve
all of the good things

30:31.900 --> 30:33.100
that are happening to you?

30:33.120 --> 30:35.920
The promotion, Simon's respect.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.660
I think it's easier for you
to look into a conspiracy

30:38.680 --> 30:42.099
than it is for you to believe
that you actually deserve it.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
Hey, Max.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.720
Just wanted to say good-bye.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.260
Hey, what's wrong? Where's your dad?

30:52.300 --> 30:55.300
He got a phone call. He seemed upset.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.879
Okay, you stay here.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.240
We're gonna find out what's wrong.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.089
Ben. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

31:06.090 --> 31:07.859
Is everything okay?

31:07.860 --> 31:09.229
Uh, no.

31:09.230 --> 31:11.729
No. I, uh, just got a call

31:11.730 --> 31:14.300
from Kaplan Industrial Supply.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.040
They're taking back their job offer.

31:17.060 --> 31:18.640
What? What happened?

31:18.670 --> 31:20.419
The background check shows

31:20.420 --> 31:23.200
I don't live at the address
that I gave them anymore.

31:23.260 --> 31:26.150
They said I lied, so they can't hire me.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.760
Man, look, I am so sorry,

31:27.770 --> 31:29.719
but why didn't you just
tell them the truth?

31:29.720 --> 31:32.219
Because the last job I applied to,

31:32.220 --> 31:34.419
when I told them about
my living situation,

31:34.420 --> 31:35.779
they said they couldn't hire anybody

31:35.780 --> 31:37.200
without a permanent address.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.960
It's like a cruel joke, man.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.359
I can't get a home without a job.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.429
Without a home, no one will hire me.

31:46.430 --> 31:48.069
How the hell am I supposed to get myself

31:48.070 --> 31:49.160
out of this situation?

31:49.800 --> 31:52.780
Dad? Is everything okay?

31:52.860 --> 31:56.120
Just, uh, just go back to your bed, Max.

31:56.140 --> 31:58.079
Dad, you can't give up.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.209
You'll get a job and
we'll find our castle.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.280
There aren't no castles, Max!

32:05.550 --> 32:07.599
Just... just go back to the bed.

32:17.660 --> 32:20.050
I just play this game,
you know, with Max,

32:20.060 --> 32:21.070
trying to protect him.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.880
Guess I'm the one that
needs to face reality.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.690
Because Monday morning
I'm supposed to be

32:28.700 --> 32:31.980
at Social Services and
I am at square one.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.760
I am not losing that kid.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.699
Even if we have to leave town.

32:38.700 --> 32:39.880
I'm not losing that kid.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.719
No, look, you can't run now or
you will be running forever.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.900
It's better that than losing Max.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.900
Don't do anything until
you hear from us.

32:49.160 --> 32:53.220
- Why, Miles...
- Just trust me.

33:02.950 --> 33:07.140
Look, I appreciate you
wanting to help you friend

33:07.160 --> 33:08.879
get back on his feet,

33:08.880 --> 33:10.340
but he lied.

33:10.410 --> 33:13.079
Right, but he lied because he's homeless

33:13.080 --> 33:15.040
and every employer he has told that to

33:15.050 --> 33:16.200
has not given him a shot.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.140
Look, I right for "Catapult."

33:19.170 --> 33:22.620
I'd be happy to do a piece on
how amazing this company is

33:22.630 --> 33:25.800
to give a man like Ben a job
when no one else would.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.599
It's the kind of PR money can't buy.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.520
You're right, but unfortunately

33:30.540 --> 33:32.649
we've already given the
job to someone else.

33:32.650 --> 33:35.779
There must be something you can do.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.220
Have Ben call me in a few weeks

33:38.240 --> 33:40.360
and I'll see if we can
find him something.

33:40.370 --> 33:42.880
That's not gonna work. He
needs a job by Monday.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.920
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.720
Hey, Dad...

33:59.790 --> 34:02.789
Wait, what do you mean Max is gone?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.300
He took his flag?

34:06.010 --> 34:08.748
He went to go find a castle.
I know where he went.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.289
Max! Max!

34:14.290 --> 34:17.018
- I don't see him.
- Where could he be?

34:17.020 --> 34:19.219
Max! Max?

34:19.239 --> 34:20.599
Are you here! Max!

34:20.600 --> 34:22.998
Hey, hey, don't worry. We'll find him.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.869
- Max!
- Max!

34:24.870 --> 34:27.040
- Wait guys, look.
- Max!

34:28.560 --> 34:31.400
Max, hold on, okay! Your dad's coming!

34:33.199 --> 34:35.480
- Max, come down here!
- Max!

34:35.500 --> 34:37.560
Max, okay, just hold on, okay?

34:37.580 --> 34:40.040
- Just... just step back.
- No! I gotta hang up

34:40.050 --> 34:41.799
Mom's flag on the castle, first.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.260
- Just wait, Max!
- I need to do this!

34:44.280 --> 34:46.739
- No, you don't, Max!
- Yes, I do!

34:48.679 --> 34:51.000
- Dad!
- I got you, buddy.

34:55.330 --> 34:58.730
Oh, God.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.120
Max, what were you thinking?

35:03.200 --> 35:06.380
I wanted to show you
that castles were real.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.220
That you can't give up.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.169
We can still find ours.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.100
You just have to believe.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.010
I'm sorry, Max.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.440
You know, I've tried to be
brave for you, you know?

35:28.450 --> 35:29.780
To protect you.

35:29.810 --> 35:32.100
To make you feel like this
is just one big adventure.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.439
But maybe it's time for
you to see the world

35:36.440 --> 35:38.220
as it really is.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.200
For me to see it that way, too.

35:42.380 --> 35:46.020
Dad, I know there's no
such thing as dragons.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.080
I would never live in a real castle.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.779
Why do you keep playing along, then?

35:52.780 --> 35:55.539
Mom told me it was a
way I could remind you

35:55.540 --> 35:57.980
that everything was going to be okay.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.980
Yeah, she... she told
me the same thing, too.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.819
So all this time I thought
I was protecting you,

36:10.820 --> 36:12.740
turns out you were protecting me, huh?

36:18.340 --> 36:20.860
God, I love you, Max.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.899
Hey, you know what?

36:23.900 --> 36:26.239
I promise you

36:26.240 --> 36:28.740
that no matter what life may bring us

36:29.200 --> 36:32.080
I will never give up on us again.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.720
Ever.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.989
Hey, you guys okay?

36:40.990 --> 36:42.649
Yeah, yeah. Everyone's all right.

36:42.650 --> 36:45.789
Excuse me, we heard a
commotion out here.

36:45.790 --> 36:47.000
Is everything okay?

36:47.010 --> 36:49.079
Yeah, my son went up onto the roof.

36:49.080 --> 36:50.340
I had to go get him down.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.380
I'm sorry I wasn't here to stop him.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.439
We've been short staffed this past week.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.740
One of our guys just retired

36:55.750 --> 36:57.339
and we haven't found a replacement, so.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.080
So does that mean you're
looking for someone?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.599
Yeah, we just need somebody

37:03.600 --> 37:05.429
with the right experience
and background.

37:05.430 --> 37:07.900
Would military experience qualify?

37:07.940 --> 37:09.260
Absolutely.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.600
All right. Well, you hear that, Ben?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.639
- You serve?
- Two tours in Iraq.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.260
No kidding. I served in Iraq too.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.560
First Armored. You?

37:18.580 --> 37:20.480
Third Infantry.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.320
And I just so happen to
be looking for a job.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.060
Come by our office tomorrow.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.119
Maybe we can work something out.

37:30.850 --> 37:32.520
Thank you.

37:35.490 --> 37:38.059
Oh, and, um, thanks for coming by.

37:38.060 --> 37:41.329
Oh, and I'm glad everything
worked out with Ben and Max.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.399
Yeah, me too.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.820
So, Dad, what did you
want to talk to us about?

37:45.860 --> 37:47.999
Um...

37:51.640 --> 37:54.080
I've decided I'm not going to
accept the bid for bishop.

37:54.210 --> 37:55.700
- What?
- Why?

37:55.720 --> 37:57.680
Dad, this is what you've always wanted.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.019
As is often the case with things,

38:00.020 --> 38:02.380
the dream is far more
appealing than reality.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.920
Did something happen?

38:04.980 --> 38:08.059
Lester and the board believe
that in order to garner

38:08.060 --> 38:10.100
the support in the election,
I should shy away

38:10.110 --> 38:13.420
from talking about my personal life.

38:13.460 --> 38:16.929
But I will never

38:16.930 --> 38:19.299
shy away from you two.

38:19.300 --> 38:23.720
You are the greatest
achievement of my life.

38:25.780 --> 38:27.960
Yeah.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.440
But I get what Lester's saying.

38:31.010 --> 38:32.309
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.919
Absolutely.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.240
If you have to avoid talking

38:35.250 --> 38:37.360
about our family, who cares?

38:39.380 --> 38:40.619
I don't understand. I mean,

38:40.620 --> 38:42.520
how could both of you be okay with this?

38:42.530 --> 38:45.259
Because there is no other
reverend out there

38:45.260 --> 38:47.999
as experienced and open-minded

38:48.000 --> 38:50.560
and as good and decent as you.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.169
You've already reached so many
people from your pulpit here.

38:54.170 --> 38:57.209
Just think of what you can
do on a bigger stage.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.959
Yeah, play the political game, Dad.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.509
Okay, we know who you are
and what you stand for.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.320
And when you become bishop,

39:03.340 --> 39:05.200
everyone else will, too.

39:06.350 --> 39:08.079
Hm.

39:12.790 --> 39:17.229
Lately I have been thinking
about the meaning of home

39:17.230 --> 39:21.949
and I realize that home
can be so much more

39:21.950 --> 39:24.580
than just a roof over your head.

39:25.770 --> 39:28.720
Home can be that feeling you have

39:28.740 --> 39:32.199
when everything in life
finally comes together.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.939
Or a place

39:36.940 --> 39:39.579
that you can fill with
beautiful memories.

39:44.190 --> 39:45.889
Ahh.

39:45.890 --> 39:48.520
I can't thank you guys enough
for everything you've done.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.259
You're welcome.

39:50.260 --> 39:53.799
Hey, Max, I know this
tiny place is no castle,

39:53.800 --> 39:55.760
but it's a start.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.680
Dad, this is a castle.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.690
Well, let's plant that flag.

40:13.310 --> 40:16.680
Now, home isn't always guaranteed.

40:16.700 --> 40:19.500
It's something you might
have to fight hard for.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.159
Even sacrifice for.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.020
So, Arthur,

40:23.040 --> 40:24.580
have you made a decision?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.500
Let's proceed.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.540
You won't regret it.

40:32.580 --> 40:37.769
Something that needs to be
preserved and protected.

40:37.770 --> 40:39.109
Just read your piece

40:39.110 --> 40:41.209
on New York City's new park ranger.

40:41.210 --> 40:43.680
It's well crafted, heartwarming article.

40:44.210 --> 40:45.860
Glad you liked it.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.719
It's great.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.820
But it's not the story that's gonna take

40:49.840 --> 40:51.920
your career to the next level, Cara.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.439
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna write

40:55.440 --> 40:56.900
about Miles and the God Account.

40:58.830 --> 41:01.299
You know, you told me
that a good journalist

41:01.300 --> 41:03.299
doesn't reveal their source.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.120
They also don't let personal feelings

41:05.140 --> 41:07.360
get in the way of a great story.

41:09.580 --> 41:11.780
Because there is nothing better

41:11.800 --> 41:13.939
than having a place that you can share

41:13.940 --> 41:16.109
with the people you love.

41:16.110 --> 41:17.790
I mean, I still can't believe

41:17.800 --> 41:20.219
that we managed to find
Ben a home and he gets

41:20.220 --> 41:21.540
to guard and actual castle.

41:21.550 --> 41:23.249
Yeah, I'm excited for him.

41:23.250 --> 41:27.120
Just about as excited as
I am for our next date.

41:27.140 --> 41:30.200
I was thinking Thai food?

41:30.220 --> 41:31.540
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:34.020 --> 41:37.200
You know, I think we were
interrupted earlier.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.020
Yeah. Yeah, we were.

41:41.100 --> 41:43.860
Guys, guys! I got huge news!

41:44.670 --> 41:46.300
Oh, boy.

41:48.260 --> 41:49.779
Really got to work on your timing, dude.

41:49.780 --> 41:50.940
Yeah, I know.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.679
But I did it.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.419
My algorithm, it found a
link between Simon Hayes

41:57.420 --> 41:58.900
and one of our Friend Suggestions.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.200
- Who?
- So five years ago

42:02.220 --> 42:04.550
Simon Hayes goes to New
York Presbyterian Hospital

42:04.560 --> 42:06.460
for a bone marrow transplant, right?

42:06.480 --> 42:09.859
Turns out, the surgeon
who did the procedure:

42:09.860 --> 42:11.899
John Dove.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.099
My first Friend Suggestion?

42:14.100 --> 42:16.719
If John Dove saved Simon's life

42:16.720 --> 42:18.800
maybe that's why he sent
you his name first.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.240
His way of returning the favor.

42:21.300 --> 42:24.050
So that means Simon Hayes

42:24.060 --> 42:25.480
really could be behind the God Account?

42:25.500 --> 42:26.640
Not could be.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.420
Is.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.660
We got him.
