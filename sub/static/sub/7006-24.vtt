00:02.569 --> 00:04.799
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, honey.

00:04.871 --> 00:07.396
Well, congratulate me. I got my grades.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.136
4.0 average!

00:10.210 --> 00:13.043
- That's great, honey!
- Great. Alright.

00:13.113 --> 00:16.640
Do you have any idea how
satisfying it is to get straight A's?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.713
Sorry.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.048
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.686
This last month has been so horrible.

00:28.762 --> 00:33.426
But now, next week,
all I have to do is relax.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.025
That's it. You just
sit back and relax, honey.

00:36.102 --> 00:40.402
Would you get that for me?

00:42.442 --> 00:44.740
Well, heck! Why don't I get it?

00:46.613 --> 00:47.739
Hello?

00:47.814 --> 00:50.510
Yes, colonel, it's me. Yeah.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.916
I'm right here.
You don't have to yell at me.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.387
It's your dad. Uh-huh.
This weekend? Uh-huh.

00:58.491 --> 01:01.324
They have frequent flier mileage
that's gonna expire.

01:01.394 --> 01:06.161
They want to come this weekend.
You... I... What...?

01:06.266 --> 01:08.700
Why don't I let Jill
tell you the good news?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.971
You talk... He's your dad!

01:13.039 --> 01:15.098
Hi, Daddy.

01:15.175 --> 01:20.477
There's nothing that I would like more
than to have you visit, but I'm sick.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.277
Yeah.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.717
Yeah. A head cold.
You know, cough. Flu.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.482
I think I have an ear infection.

01:29.556 --> 01:33.117
Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.

01:33.193 --> 01:37.129
Oh, well, thank you.
I'm sure I'll feel better soon.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.358
OK. Bye.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.163
- What?
- You lied to Grandpa.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.404
- I didn't exactly lie.
- Well, then what exactly did you do?

01:51.511 --> 01:54.002
There's a very good
explanation for this.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.239
What is it?

01:57.350 --> 02:00.410
I'm really burned out from school.
I need time for myself.

02:00.487 --> 02:04.253
But if I told that to your grandpa,
it would have hurt his feelings.

02:04.357 --> 02:07.656
So when we get older and
we don't want you to visit, can we lie?

02:10.597 --> 02:13.088
Randy, when your father and I get older,

02:13.166 --> 02:16.135
you won't have to lie
because you'll want to be around us.

02:16.202 --> 02:19.365
We're gonna be just as cool
as we are right now. Right, Tim?

02:22.509 --> 02:24.443
I'm dyin' here, aren't I?

02:26.746 --> 02:29.010
All you're missing is the headstone.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.166 --> 03:23.624
- Well, hi-ho, good neighbor.
- Hi there, Wilson.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.331
Did Al and Heidi find something
at your garage sale?

03:26.406 --> 03:29.569
Oh, yes, indeed. I thought
you might be interested in this.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.270
This is a handmade wooden throne.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.311
It's nice,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.840
but if I'm sitting on a throne,
it's gonna be porcelain, my friend.

03:39.953 --> 03:43.320
Hey, Wilson. I would love to
have this antique cheese whipper.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.450
No fair. I saw it first.
I'll give you twice the asking price.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.791
- I'll double that.
- Well, that brings us up to 80 cents.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.564
I'm out.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.824
Grandma's on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.927
Thanks. Hi, Lillian.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.138
No, Jill's not here. She's...

04:01.207 --> 04:04.108
out, you know,
buying stuff to nurse her cold.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.943
What?

04:11.885 --> 04:15.514
Oh, my God! That's horrible, Lillian.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.680
How did it happen?

04:18.992 --> 04:21.825
Oh, you... How are you doing?

04:21.894 --> 04:26.389
Oh, boy!
This is horrible news, Lillian.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.026
What can I do? Just tell...

04:29.102 --> 04:33.869
Yeah. Go ahead and call all of them.
I'll have Jill call when she gets back.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.306
OK. Bye.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.611
- Tim, what happened?
- Jill's dad died.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.245
Oh, Tim. I'm so sorry.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.946
Oh, so am I. What... what happened?
Was the colonel sick?

04:48.021 --> 04:52.117
- No. It was a heart attack. Sudden.
- That's awful. Poor Jill.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.256
I'll have to take the family to Texas.
You'll have to take care of <i>Tool Time.</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.764
- Of course.
- See you, guys.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.965
Boy, this really puts things
in perspective!

05:05.038 --> 05:08.565
Yeah. Al, you take the cheese whipper.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.941
- Oh, no, no. I couldn't possibly.
- No, really. I insist.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.537
Wilson, we can't accept
this cheese whipper.

05:18.084 --> 05:23.545
OK. Um... put her on that 6:30 a.m.
flight to San Antonio, alright?

05:23.623 --> 05:26.683
Put it on my credit card and
she'll pick it up at the airport.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.489
Good. That'll be fine. Thank you.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.362
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.832
What an incredible day I had!

05:35.935 --> 05:38.062
I went to the modern art museum.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.901
Then I met Patty for lunch.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.942
We went shopping.
We got herbal wraps.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.569
You cannot imagine how good I feel.

05:45.678 --> 05:49.444
- Your mom called a little while ago.
- Oh, no. Let me guess.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.450
She's mad because I wouldn't
let her come this weekend.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.679
Honey...

05:54.587 --> 05:56.646
What? ls something wrong?

05:58.758 --> 06:00.521
It's about your dad.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.752
My dad what?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.257
He... he had a heart attack
this morning.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.361
He didn't make it, honey.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.904
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

06:18.011 --> 06:23.472
He fell asleep in that old recliner
in the den and he never woke up.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.609
He didn't suffer at all.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.210
Heart attack!

06:28.788 --> 06:32.121
I can't believe this,
I just talked to him, he sounded fine.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.161
- I know.
- What about Mom? I should...

06:35.228 --> 06:38.595
She's holding up real well.
She's holding up real well.

06:38.665 --> 06:42.101
I booked you on a morning flight, OK?

06:46.506 --> 06:48.974
I'll tie-up the loose ends
and bring the boys.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.170
- We'll head out tomorrow afternoon.
- OK. OK.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.741
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- It's OK. I'll pack. Don't worry.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.376
- I'll do...
- No. You don't understand.

06:59.485 --> 07:04.616
Dad called and asked if he could visit.
I made up that story about being sick.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.592
- How could I do that?
- You didn't know this would happen.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.619
- You needed time for yourself.
- Don't you understand?

07:11.731 --> 07:15.098
I could've seen him one more time.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.796
I could've told him that I loved him.

07:17.870 --> 07:22.967
The last thing that
I said to my father was a lie!

07:23.042 --> 07:25.567
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

07:30.950 --> 07:33.646
Guys, you gotta get packed.
How's the ironing going?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.756
Hey, you can wear a wide tie.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.496
I can't believe we're never
gonna see Grandpa again.

07:44.597 --> 07:48.431
Well, actually, we will get
a chance to see Grandpa one more time.

07:49.902 --> 07:53.668
An open casket? Geez, that's gross!

07:53.773 --> 07:56.606
Oh, just think of it like an open house.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.872
Some people think viewing the body

08:00.947 --> 08:04.110
gives them a chance to say
goodbye to the deceased once more.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.482
- What if I don't want to look?
- No one's gonna make you look.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.552
Nobody's gonna make me look.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.451
Whoa! You know,
I just thought of something.

08:16.529 --> 08:20.295
What if Mom had let Grandpa come here
for the weekend and it happened here?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.631
Yeah. He used to sleep in my room.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.069
He could've died in my bed!

08:31.411 --> 08:34.174
Then you'd still have to sleep in it.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.782
Of course, you know,
I'm sure Mom would flip the mattress.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.087
Just knock it off!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.788
You think this suit is too small?

08:50.697 --> 08:54.565
No. Besides, it's real fashionable
to show five inches of bare leg.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.531
I want to look good for the funeral.

08:57.637 --> 09:01.004
Well, I got news for you...
Grandpa's gonna look more lifelike.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.701
Grandpa just died.
Will you stop making jokes?

09:04.777 --> 09:06.472
Gentlemen, come on, come on!

09:06.546 --> 09:09.811
Take him upstairs. See if that
old brown suit of yours fits him.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.277
- Need help with that collar?
- No, Dad.

09:13.353 --> 09:17.687
I know how to iron for a funeral.
You just set the dial to "stiff."

09:21.294 --> 09:22.659
- Randy?
- Yeah, Dad.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.163
I don't know why
I'm making these stupid jokes.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.962
It's OK. Sometimes making jokes is
a way to deal with the loss of somebody.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.970
That's how you grieve.
I did it at my dad's funeral.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.038
Oh, yeah.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.439
I mean, now that you talk about it,
I remember Aunt Rita's funeral.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.670
You had some good jokes.
And you killed.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.281
The truth is, in these situations, be
careful who you make the jokes around.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.319
I know. I would never say
this kind of stuff around Grandma.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.878
And make no jokes around your mom,
or Mark, or anybody sensitive.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.925
Just do 'em around me.

09:57.029 --> 10:00.294
Sorry we're late. Jill's plane
couldn't get clearance to land.

10:00.366 --> 10:03.028
They kept circling the airport.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.935
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm OK.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.530
But you with your flu
and your ear infection.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.066
No, really. I feel much better.
Where's Mom?

10:12.145 --> 10:15.603
Oh, she's back at the house
helping Robin and Carrie with the food.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.473
This is Mr. Stillman,
the funeral director.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.382
- Hello.
- My sisters Jill and Tracy.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.013
Welcome to our newly remodeled chapel

10:23.089 --> 10:27.150
featured in the June issue
of <i>Mortuaries Illustrated.</i>

10:30.029 --> 10:32.554
Was that the swimsuit issue?

10:33.533 --> 10:37.902
It's gonna be a lovely service.
I know the colonel would have approved.

10:38.004 --> 10:42.304
- Oh, did you know our father?
- We feel we know our guests in spirit.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.833
Your guests? What is this?
The Bates Motel?

10:46.846 --> 10:49.007
Come in my office when you're ready.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.845
We'll talk about
what Dad will be wearing.

10:53.085 --> 10:57.920
Oh, Jill, before I forget,
I want to give you this herbal medicine.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.151
Now, you take two Echinacea,

11:00.226 --> 11:03.889
one Goldenseal,
and a garlic pill twice a day.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.461
Hi, girls. I... oh, Jill.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.193
Mom.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.925
How are you doing?

11:11.003 --> 11:13.699
Oh, I'm better now that
all my girls are here.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.834
You were staying home because you didn't
trust Robin and Carrie with the food.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.470
Well, I finished all that
and I came down here.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.140
You don't trust us
with the funeral arrangements?

11:23.249 --> 11:27.618
It's not that I don't trust you.
It's just that I trust myself more.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.954
How are you feeling, honey?
You look terrible.

11:31.057 --> 11:35.517
- Actually, I'm much better.
- Jill, you always were a terrible liar.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.292
If you're sick, you're sick.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.430
Would you girls mind if I
spend a moment with Jill?

11:42.502 --> 11:45.369
Oh, sure. Sure, Mom.
You spend your moment with Jill.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.805
We'll just go talk wardrobe
with Mr. Sunshine.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.677
- Mom, how are you holding up?
- Oh, I'm hanging in there.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.747
What about you? I hope all that
traveling wasn't too hard on you,

11:58.818 --> 12:01.514
what with that flu
and your ear infection.

12:01.587 --> 12:04.818
No, really, Mom.
I'm feeling much better now.

12:06.626 --> 12:10.187
You know, you always had
a special place in your dad's heart.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.457
I know. I know.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.990
He was really looking forward
to that trip to see you.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.628
- He was?
- Oh, yes.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.901
But you were sick.
And, of course, he understood.

12:22.008 --> 12:26.877
Now the irony is
that you made the trip to see him.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.120
OK. Everything's ready for dinner.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.350
I need someone to help
with the fruit salad.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.222
- I'll help.
- No, you might still be contagious.

12:42.328 --> 12:45.593
We don't want Mom to catch anything,
her resistance is low.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.828
Guys, there's something
I have to tell you.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.994
I'm not really sick.

12:51.370 --> 12:56.034
Yeah, right. You look like that and
you're gonna tell us you're not sick.

12:57.944 --> 13:02.005
Always the martyr.
Here. Go sit down and rest.

13:04.350 --> 13:08.650
- I can't believe this.
- Neither can I.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.281
I keep thinking I'm gonna
come down these stairs

13:11.390 --> 13:14.450
and see your father in front of the TV

13:14.527 --> 13:17.894
yelling at those
"liberal Yankee newscasters!"

13:18.864 --> 13:21.697
Mom, is there anything
that I can do for you?

13:21.767 --> 13:25.032
Don't worry about me. You're
the one that we have to take care of.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.471
You lie down right there and rest.
Why don't I make you some soup?

13:28.574 --> 13:30.940
You're supposed to drink
lots of liquids.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.908
Really, I'm feeling so much better.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.743
Now, Jill,
I can take care of my daughter.

13:35.848 --> 13:39.807
Now, you just stay right there.
And don't you lift a finger.

13:42.788 --> 13:46.246
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.056
Did you iron your shirts? I want you
to look good for the funeral tomorrow.

13:50.129 --> 13:53.895
Come on, Mom, you've been through
enough. Let's not talk about the shirts.

13:55.701 --> 13:59.159
Go into the kitchen and say hi
to your aunts and your grandma.

13:59.238 --> 14:03.004
Are they still gonna pinch us even
though we're here for a funeral?

14:03.109 --> 14:05.873
The sadder the occasion,
the harder the pinching.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.037
See this scar?
My dad's funeral. Aunt Winnie.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.447
She took a piece of my flesh
right off there.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.815
Oh, look how you've grown!

14:15.888 --> 14:17.355
Ow!

14:17.423 --> 14:20.392
- How are you doing?
- You won't believe what's going on.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.393
Well, let me guess.

14:22.461 --> 14:25.362
Your mom thinks you're sick,
so she's waiting on you.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.923
- Tim, I have to tell her the truth.
- Now is not a good time.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.764
Why?

14:30.836 --> 14:35.603
If she finds out you lied, it'll cast
a pall over the whole funeral.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.009
I'm so glad you're here.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.181
Did you fight in Korea with my grandpa?

14:43.282 --> 14:47.184
- I would've been two years old.
- You would have been in the infantry?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.649
"Infant-try."

14:50.723 --> 14:55.387
You know, I'll always cherish
Daddy's nickname for me.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.021
Nutcase?

14:59.999 --> 15:02.467
He said it with such love.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.972
Come on, everyone. Who has a story about
Colonel Patterson they'd like to share?

15:07.039 --> 15:09.007
- Tim.
- Oh...

15:09.108 --> 15:12.168
remember the first time that Jill
brought me to meet him?

15:12.244 --> 15:13.711
Oh, yeah. I remember that.

15:13.779 --> 15:17.408
When Jill finally left us alone,
the colonel turned to me and said,

15:17.483 --> 15:22.045
"How much will it take for
you to turn around and never come back?"

15:24.323 --> 15:27.053
Years later he gave
me the best compliment ever,

15:27.126 --> 15:30.857
"Son, ten grand!
That's my final offer!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.091
You can't handle the truth!"

15:34.400 --> 15:37.164
Dad was gruff,
but he always told it like it was.

15:37.236 --> 15:42.401
Yes. Honesty was very important to him,
he instilled that in all his children.

15:42.508 --> 15:46.274
Jill, would you
like to say a few words?

15:46.378 --> 15:48.471
Oh, sure.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.380
Yes, well, Dad was really...

15:51.450 --> 15:55.944
There was this one time that we, uh...

15:56.021 --> 15:58.717
I really don't want
to do this right now. Mom...

15:58.791 --> 16:02.227
can I talk to
you, privately, for a moment?

16:03.829 --> 16:06.923
Poor thing.
She's a little under the weather.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.601
Well... Then there
was the time the colonel

16:11.670 --> 16:15.504
introduced my butt
to the business end of a bayonet.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.574
Let me show you the puncture wound.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.608
- Mom...
- Honey, you look so pale.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.241
- This flu that's going around...
- Mom, it's not the flu.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.650
Now, look, there's something
that I have to tell you.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.155
I lied to Dad.

16:31.223 --> 16:35.319
Oh, Jill, relax. He found out a long
time ago that you vote democrat.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.630
No, Mom.

16:39.698 --> 16:44.135
When Dad called to ask if you all
could come up and visit,

16:44.203 --> 16:47.832
I said that I was sick.
I made that up.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.637
You didn't want us to visit you?

16:50.709 --> 16:53.678
No, Mom. It just...
It wasn't a good time.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.512
I thought you'd understand, but I
didn't have the guts to say no to Dad!

16:59.285 --> 17:03.346
Well, your father was not
an easy man to say no to.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.446
Well, maybe not.

17:05.523 --> 17:09.016
But now the last memory I have
of my father is lying to him.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.759
What do you suppose would've
happened if you'd told him the truth?

17:15.835 --> 17:18.667
I don't know! He probably
would've understood.

17:18.737 --> 17:22.638
I don't think we're talking
about the same colonel.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.769
Well, how do you think
he would've reacted?

17:27.279 --> 17:28.940
He would've said,

17:29.014 --> 17:32.541
"What do you mean you want time for
yourself? We'll be there at 0800

17:32.618 --> 17:36.748
- and we're bivouacking in Brad's room."
- That does sound like Dad.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.188
He always had to have
everything his own way.

17:39.258 --> 17:43.592
It could be 20 below zero and he'd
still want the window open at night.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.426
You remember when
he went in for his knee surgery?

17:46.498 --> 17:51.162
Oh, yeah. He yelled at that surgeon
because the scalpel wasn't shiny enough.

17:52.972 --> 17:57.705
Then he told the doctor to drop and give
him 20 on the operating room floor.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.976
I guess Dad could be
kinda pushy sometimes.

18:02.047 --> 18:06.609
He was pushy, he was stubborn,
he was hotheaded, and he drove me crazy.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.290
And I miss him so much...

18:12.992 --> 18:16.519
Oh, Mom.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.624
Now, Jill, you have always
been a wonderful daughter.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.931
And the last thing your father
would want would be for you to...

18:25.004 --> 18:28.303
torture yourself
over a silly little fib.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.643
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too, honey.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.179
I don't remember that picture of us.

18:40.252 --> 18:44.018
- Which base was that taken at?
- Oh, that was Fort Hood.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.058
That was the base
where Elvis was stationed.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.687
- Dad knew Elvis?
- He was his commanding officer.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.527
Who do you think <i>Hound Dog</i>
was written about?

18:56.869 --> 19:00.361
Wait. Is this Army mule the
same one I'm holding in the picture?

19:00.439 --> 19:02.930
Yes. That was your favorite, remember?

19:03.008 --> 19:06.535
But it's all ratty. Why would Dad
hold onto it all of these years?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.842
To remind him of you.

19:10.082 --> 19:13.643
He always hated it
that you had to live so far away.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.243
Oh, Mom...

19:15.321 --> 19:19.553
Five years ago, your father took that
mascot and put it on top of the TV set.

19:19.625 --> 19:24.153
And, ever since that time, Army has
beaten Navy every football game.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.163
So I guess I was
kind of a good luck charm.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.134
I guess you were.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.698
Can I keep him?

19:34.506 --> 19:36.872
I think your father would like that...

19:36.976 --> 19:39.945
provided you keep it
on top of the television set.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.572
Deal.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.649
- Mom?
- Huh?

19:45.884 --> 19:48.114
You know, if you moved to Michigan,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.348
you wouldn't have to be
so far away from us.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.849
But I'd be far away from Tracy,
and Linda, and Carrie and Robin.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.792
Exactly my point.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.896
Oh, Jill, I'd love to be near you,

20:00.966 --> 20:05.869
but I think it's too soon for me
to start making any changes.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.303
OK.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.308
Let's go in there and listen
to more happy memories of Dad.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.741
OK.

20:12.177 --> 20:16.238
So there I was getting strip-searched
by a colonel of the United States Army!

20:18.517 --> 20:21.850
At that point I knew I was
a family member, I'll tell you that.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.855
Boy, that guy had big hands! Woo!

20:31.030 --> 20:33.590
The boys are in bed.
What are you doing?

20:34.933 --> 20:37.959
I just finished my eulogy for tomorrow.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.495
My sisters and I are each
gonna give a little speech.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.734
Well, I'm sure yours'll be the best.

20:44.643 --> 20:48.602
It's not a contest, honey. We're just
gonna share our feelings about Dad.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.040
The colonel was a
real great man, you know?

20:53.118 --> 20:55.678
Yeah, he was.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.684
You know, I thought I would
feel so much better

20:58.757 --> 21:01.590
when I told Mom the truth, but...

21:01.660 --> 21:03.821
now I just feel sadder.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.530
It's understandable.
You're allowing yourself to grieve.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.760
Yeah, I guess.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.902
You've been so great.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.531
Oh, yeah.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.973
You took care of
all the travel arrangements.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.341
You took care of the boys.
You took care of me.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.313
I did what I had to.
I didn't think twice about it, honey.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.145
That's what makes it so wonderful.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.777
That I can count on you
when I need you the most.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.749
I'm just sorry you had to be reminded
of that fact on such a sad occasion.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.993
Listen to you.
You're saying all the right things.

21:40.899 --> 21:43.959
Enjoy it while you can.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.736
I don't know where it's coming from.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.207
But I'm sure it's not gonna last.
