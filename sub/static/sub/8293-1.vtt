CAB FARE, RICHARD?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.134
NO, I'VE GOT
TO PAY SOME BILLS.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.095
WELL, AT LEAST LEAVE ME
ENOUGH FOR BREAKFAST.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.513
WHY, TODDY,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.033
ONE WOULD SUSPECT YOU
THINK I'M MERCENARY.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.599
TRY UNSCRUPULOUS.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.018
YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.688
I'D SAY WE BOTH GET
MY MONEY'S WORTH.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.525
LOOK, TODDY, IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH THE ARRANGEMENT...

03:12.734 --> 03:15.111
AS A MATTER OF
RECORD, I'M NOT,

03:15.320 --> 03:17.530

03:17.739 --> 03:19.490
"LOVE LOOKS NOT

03:27.875 --> 03:29.709
HAVE A NICE DAY, TODDY.

YES. WELL,
YOU SEE, I'M LOOKING

05:07.474 --> 05:09.642
OH, I'M SURE THAT
WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE...

05:09.851 --> 05:11.644
LADY,
THAT IS LIKE A NUN

05:11.853 --> 05:13.646
SAYING WITH
A LITTLE PRACTICE,

05:13.855 --> 05:15.731
SHE COULD BECOME

05:15.941 --> 05:17.817
IT HAS TO COME NATURALLY.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.485
RIGHT.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.820
IN SOME PROFESSIONS,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.822
PRACTICE IS A MINOR
CONSIDERATION,

05:23.031 --> 05:24.824
SO TAKE MY ADVICE

05:25.033 --> 05:27.076
AND STICK TO CARMEN.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.995
I AM A COLORATURA,

ANDRE CASSELL SHOULD NEVER

I LIED.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.631

WHAT YOU THINK,

05:44.970 --> 05:46.012
MONSIEUR LABISSE,

05:46.221 --> 05:47.471
THERE ARE SOME

I COULD NOT REFUSE,

09:18.934 --> 09:20.476

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

TO LIE DOWN.

WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.002
THAT'S WHY I'M ONLY
CLOSING YOU FOR A WEEK.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.005
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I WILL LOSE IN ONE WEEK?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.133
A QUARTER OF WHAT
YOU'LL LOSE IN A MONTH

14:45.343 --> 14:47.511
IF THERE IS
ANY MORE TROUBLE.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.524
YOU'RE FIRED!

15:02.151 --> 15:03.777
I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.195
YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.989
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.198
MORE ICE.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.075
YOU TAKE IT OUT
OF MY SALARY.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.494
TODDY, GET OUT!

15:12.704 --> 15:14.329
ALL RIGHT.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.415
AND DON'T COME BACK!

15:16.624 --> 15:19.001
IF YOU EVER SET FOOT
IN THIS PLACE AGAIN,

15:19.210 --> 15:20.836
I WILL HAVE YOU THROWN OUT!

15:21.045 --> 15:22.671
DON'T MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE SUCH A THREAT.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.256
BEING THROWN OUT
OF THIS PLACE

15:24.465 --> 15:26.383
IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
THAN BEING THROWN OUT

15:26.593 --> 15:27.593
OF A LEPER COLONY.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.052
OUT!

15:37.186 --> 15:38.896
THANK YOU.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.024
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.067
AH, COULD I SEE
YOUR WINE LIST?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.028
WE HAVE
A WHITE 1934,

15:46.237 --> 15:47.571
WE HAVE A RED 1934.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.865
LAST WEEK WE
HAD SOME ROSE,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.034
BUT WE'RE USING IT
IN THE SALAD.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.744
WHICH DO YOU RECOMMEND?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.621
THE RED IS
6 CENTIMES CHEAPER.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.164
I'LL HAVE THE WHITE.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.084
I BET YOU ARE
A ROCKEFELLER.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.083
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.251
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU HAD A DOG.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.503
DOG?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.421
I'VE ONLY BEEN GONE
5 MINUTES.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.799
I FIGURED SOMETHING
HELPED YOU EAT IT.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.467
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.927
DO YOU WANT A SALAD?

16:52.136 --> 16:52.844
LATER.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.471
LATER.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.116
THE CHICKEN WAS SO GOOD,
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY THE PORK.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.516
DOES IT TAKE LONG?

16:57.725 --> 16:58.976
ABOUT, UH,
HALF AN HOUR.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.936
WHAT ABOUT
THE BOEUF BOURGUIGNONNE?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.521
THAT'S READY.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.147
I'LL HAVE THAT, AND I'LL
HAVE THE SALAD AFTERWARDS.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.858
YOU REALIZE,
OF COURSE,

17:07.068 --> 17:08.527
YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO TWO SALADS.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.862
COULD YOU PUT THEM
BOTH ON ONE PLATE?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.196
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.656
TERRIFIC.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.161
DELICIOUS WINE.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.499
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO
CHOOSE YOUR 2 DESSERTS.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.459
APPLE FLAN
AND COUPE JACQUES

17:24.669 --> 17:26.252
MIGHT GO WELL
TOGETHER.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.259
JUST A SMALL COFFEE.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.221
GOOD EVENING.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.723
I HAD THE PLEASURE

17:37.932 --> 17:39.641
OF HEARING YOU SING
THIS AFTERNOON.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.184
OH, YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.353
I... I HAVEN'T SUNG
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.980
YOUR AUDITION
AT CHEZ LUI.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.690
OH. THAT WAS NOT SINGING,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.234
AND I WOULD HARDLY
CALL IT AN AUDITION.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.236
HA HA HA. I USED
TO WORK THERE.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.863
MY CONDOLENCES.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.573
WELL, I HOPE I
HAVEN'T BOTHERED YOU.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.366
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

17:56.576 --> 17:58.493
THAT I THINK YOU
HAVE A LOVELY VOICE,

17:58.703 --> 17:59.745
AND TO SAY
HOW SORRY I AM

17:59.954 --> 18:01.371
THAT I CAN'T BUY
YOU DINNER.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.581
THANK YOU.
OOPS.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.749
PARDON ME,
MONSIEUR.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.083
OH, THANK YOU.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.773
COULD I HAVE A KNIFE
AND FORK, PLEASE?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.587
EXCUSE ME.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.048
WHY ARE YOU SORRY THAT
YOU CAN'T BUY ME DINNER?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.924
CASSE.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.426
BROKE?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.094
I'M ALSO
CARROLL TODD...

18:16.304 --> 18:19.097
TODDY TO NEARLY
EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS ME.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.891
VICTORIA...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
GRANT.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.770
I HOPE WE MEET AGAIN
WHEN I'M FLUSH.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.438
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.356
PLEASE?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.652
HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.406
THANK YOU.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.789
YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY STRANGE.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.415
AT THE CLUB,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

18:45.625 --> 18:47.626
JUST ABOUT AT THE END
OF YOUR ROPE.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.544
I WAS. I AM.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.964
THIS IS THE FIRST
DECENT MEAL I'VE HAD

18:53.174 --> 18:54.591
IN ALMOST FOUR DAYS.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.801
AND YOU CAN'T PAY FOR IT.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.761
CASSE.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.304
HA! HA! HA!

18:59.514 --> 19:02.224
AND YOU WANT ME TO
HAVE DINNER WITH YOU.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.642
I WANT YOU

19:03.851 --> 19:05.936
TO HAVE THE BEST DAMN
DINNER YOU EVER HAD.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.270
HAVE TWO.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.832
I STARTED OFF WITH
THE ROAST CHICKEN,

19:08.856 --> 19:10.167
AND I SEGUED TO
THE BOEUF BOURGUIGNONNE.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.316
IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS

19:11.526 --> 19:12.526
WHAT I COULD END UP
WITH.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.653
OH, I'D GUESS
ABOUT 30 DAYS.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.988
IF ALL GOES WELL,

19:17.198 --> 19:19.616
I EXPECT TO LEAVE
HERE POOR BUT SATED.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.536
I HAVE A...

19:22.745 --> 19:24.162
BUG IN MY PURSE.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.747
AT THE APPROPRIATE
MOMENT,

19:25.957 --> 19:27.457
IT GOES IN MY SALAD.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.959
IT'LL NEVER WORK.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.418
A BUG
IN MY SALAD?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.504
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,
IT WOULD BE AN EVENT

19:32.713 --> 19:35.590
IF THERE WASN'T
A BUG IN YOUR SALAD.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.676
WHAT ABOUT A...
COCKROACH?

19:37.885 --> 19:38.885
A COCKROACH?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.512
SHH!

19:40.721 --> 19:41.972
BIGGER THAN
YOUR THUMB.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.515
OH, GOD!

19:43.724 --> 19:44.724
WAITER.

19:44.809 --> 19:45.976
TRY THE CHICKEN.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.186
I REALLY
RECOMMEND IT.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.606
UM, THE BOURGUIGNONNE
WAS JUST A LITTLE TOUGH.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.608
MAYBE THE WAY
YOU'RE EATING,

19:53.818 --> 19:54.898
YOUR JAWS ARE
GETTING TIRED.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.361
SPEAKING OF
OVERWORKED JAWS,

19:56.571 --> 19:58.989
WHY DON'T YOU TREAT YOURS
TO A SABBATICAL

19:59.198 --> 20:01.366
AND FETCH ME
A WINE LIST?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.951
THIS IS ALL
THEY HAVE.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.370
THIS? LAST TIME I SAW
A SPECIMEN LIKE THIS,

20:05.580 --> 20:07.455
THEY HAD TO
SHOOT THE HORSE.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.624
HOW LUCKY
CAN YOU GET?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.002
IN ONE EVENING,
A ROCKEFELLER

20:12.211 --> 20:13.712
AND A GROUCHO MARX.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.047
THEY DIDN'T SHOOT
A REAL HORSE.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.383
JUST A COSTUME
WITH TWO WAITERS IN IT.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.052
I SHALL THINK
OF A SHARP RETORT

20:21.262 --> 20:23.054
WHILE I'M GETTING
YOUR ROAST CHICKEN.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.891
IT'S A WISE MAN WHO KNOWS
WHEN TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.476
AND IT IS A MORON
WHO GIVES ADVICE

20:28.686 --> 20:30.145
TO A HORSE'S ASS.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.775
HA HA HA HA!

20:42.825 --> 20:43.950
I MADE THE
DRESSING MYSELF

20:44.160 --> 20:46.411
WITH THE LAST
OF THE ROSE.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.038
I'LL BET IT'S DELICIOUS.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.414
I WOULDN'T BET
ON IT.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.082
GO ON, TRY IT.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.852
I THINK I'LL WAIT TILL
THE BOURGUIGNONNE

20:53.044 --> 20:54.044
SETTLE A BIT.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.921
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EAT IT.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.130
OH, I WANT TO.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.382
YOU WILL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.679
YOU'D BETTER GO NOW.

21:04.889 --> 21:05.931
I WANT TO LEND MY SUPPORT.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.599
OH, THAT'S LOVELY.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.935
BUT IT'S MY COCKROACH
IN MY PURSE,

21:10.144 --> 21:12.020
AND I HAVE TO GET IT
INTO MY SALAD.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.689
I'M PERFECTLY WILLING
TO TAKE OVER YOUR SALAD.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.275
YOU CAN JUST SLIP ME
THE PURSE UNDER THE TABLE.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.276
LISTEN, YOU
HATE COCKROACHES

21:18.486 --> 21:19.486
AS MUCH AS I DO,

21:19.654 --> 21:21.029
WHAT IF I MANAGE
AND YOU FAINT?

21:21.239 --> 21:23.240
THEN IT'S POSSIBLE
I SHALL WAKE UP IN PRISON.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.617
THEN I CAN'T TALK
YOU OUT OF IT?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.410
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.122
CAREFUL IT DOESN'T CRAWL OUT.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.999
ANYBODY LOOKING?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.585
NOPE.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.135
I DON'T SEE IT.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.136
HOW'S THE SALAD?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.137
AAH!

21:46.347 --> 21:47.472
HAVE YOU
TRIED IT YET?

21:47.682 --> 21:48.932
NO.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.934
NO. I WAS, UM,
JUST ABOUT TO.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.812
WE WOULD LIKE ANOTHER
BOTTLE OF WINE.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.397
WE'D LIKE TO TRY THE RED.

21:55.606 --> 21:56.940
AAH!

22:00.069 --> 22:02.320
CO-CO-COCKROACH.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.571
A COCKROACH?

22:03.781 --> 22:05.115
IN MY SA-SA-SALAD.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.658
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.118
I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.887
ARE YOU IMPUGNING
THIS LADY'S INTEGRITY?

22:09.996 --> 22:11.121
SHE'S IMPUGNING
MY SALAD.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.330
OH, NO, NO, NO.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.820
I-I-I'M SURE
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT

22:14.000 --> 22:15.917
YOUR SALAD HAD
A COCKROACH IN IT.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.335
IT DIDN'T,
AND IT WASN'T.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.004
I DEMAND TO SEE
THE MANAGER.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.505
YES, SIR.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.339
THIS LADY FOUND
A COCKROACH IN HER SALAD.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.008
SO I GATHER.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.801
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.761
I'M GOING TO
APOLOGIZE.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.680
MADAME, I REGRET
THAT YOU FOUND

22:28.889 --> 22:30.515
A COCKROACH
IN YOUR SALAD.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.976
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS

22:33.185 --> 22:34.519
I'VE BEEN RUNNING
THIS RESTAURANT,

22:34.729 --> 22:36.521
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN
TWO OTHER OCCASIONS

22:36.731 --> 22:37.939
WHEN CUSTOMERS
COMPLAINED

22:38.149 --> 22:40.525
OF HAVING FOUND INSECTS
IN THEIR FOOD.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.027
YOU SEE?
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.445
ON BOTH OCCASIONS,

22:43.654 --> 22:45.155
IT TURNED OUT
THAT THE CUSTOMERS

22:45.364 --> 22:48.325
HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE
INSECTS IN THEIR FOOD,

22:48.534 --> 22:50.160
HOPING TO BLACKMAIL
THE RESTAURANT

22:50.369 --> 22:53.163
AND THUS AVOID HAVING
TO PAY THEIR CHECKS.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.622
UH-HUH.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.708
SURELY YOU'RE
NOT SUGGESTING...

22:56.917 --> 22:57.917
THAT MADAME
IS TRYING

22:58.044 --> 22:58.710
TO AVOID
PAYING HER CHECK?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.045
WELL, OF COURSE NOT,

23:00.254 --> 23:02.297
AND AS A MANAGER
OF THIS RESTAURANT,

23:02.506 --> 23:04.132
I HOPE MADAME
ACCEPTS MY APOLOGY

23:04.342 --> 23:05.383
FOR ANY
INCONVENIENCE

23:05.593 --> 23:07.385
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
CAUSED.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.387
THANK YOU.
MA... MADAME DOES.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.223
NOW, THAT IS WHAT I
HAVE DONE ABOUT IT.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.393
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

23:15.603 --> 23:16.603
I?

23:16.729 --> 23:17.479
THERE IS STILL
THE MATTER

23:17.688 --> 23:18.688
OF YOUR CHECK.

23:18.773 --> 23:19.814
MY CHECK?

23:20.024 --> 23:21.066
THERE WAS
NO COCKROACH

23:21.275 --> 23:22.650
IN YOUR SALAD.

23:22.860 --> 23:23.651
NO, NO.
I INVITED THIS MAN

23:23.861 --> 23:24.569
TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

23:24.779 --> 23:25.779
OH, I SEE.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.238
AM I TO GATHER,
MADAME,

23:27.448 --> 23:30.033
THAT SINCE THIS
GENTLEMAN IS YOUR GUEST,

23:30.242 --> 23:31.993
YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT YOU SHOULD PAY

23:32.203 --> 23:33.578
FOR HIS DINNER, EITHER?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.348
I WOULD SAY THAT
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES

23:35.414 --> 23:37.174
THAT'S THE ONLY
LOGICAL CONCLUSION AVAILABLE.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.585
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT
I CONSIDER TO BE

23:40.795 --> 23:43.213
THE ONLY LOGICAL
CONCLUSION AVAILABLE.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.091
EITHER YOU OR MADAME
WILL PAY THE ENTIRE...

23:46.300 --> 23:47.425
AAH!

24:06.946 --> 24:07.946
THIS WAY!

24:08.114 --> 24:09.406
WHAT?!

24:09.615 --> 24:11.282
WHAT?!

24:11.492 --> 24:14.077
I WAS
THE LEADING SOPRANO

24:14.286 --> 24:16.037
OF THE BATH TOURING
LIGHT OPERA COMPANY.

24:16.247 --> 24:18.039
VERY ATHLETIC
FOR A SOPRANO.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.041
THAT'S BECAUSE I
HAVE THREE BROTHERS.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.292
HMM, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.782
I GREW UP WITH
TWO OLDER SISTERS.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.463
BLESS YOU.

24:25.673 --> 24:26.673
THANK YOU.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.758
I THINK
I'M CATCHING A COLD.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.638
DO YOU HAVE
ANY BICARBONATE?

24:33.848 --> 24:35.640
TOP SHELF.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.059
I HAVE THE WORST
HEARTBURN.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.063
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

24:42.273 --> 24:45.066
YOU WANT TO KNOW
IF I'M A HOMOSEXUAL?

24:45.276 --> 24:46.484
NO.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.820
I WANT TO KNOW IF
YOU'RE A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.071
HA HA HA!

24:50.281 --> 24:51.656
NOT NECESSARILY.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.199
OH.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.706
OH. WELL,
MY HUSBAND WAS.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.084
THE DAY WE GOT MARRIED,
HE GOT THE SHINGLES,

25:03.294 --> 25:04.669
AND WHEN WE GOT
DIVORCED,

25:04.879 --> 25:06.087
HIS ULCER PERFORATED.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.300
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A HOMOSEXUAL?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.011
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN A SOPRANO?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.471
SINCE I WAS 12.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.556
I WAS A LATE BLOOMER.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.852
WHAT HAPPENED

25:21.061 --> 25:23.563
TO THE BATH TOURING
LIGHT OPERA COMPANY?

25:25.608 --> 25:27.442
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY

25:27.651 --> 25:30.820
LOU CASSAVA TOOK FRENCH
LEAVE WITH THE BANKROLL.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.197
LOU CASSAVA?

25:32.406 --> 25:35.200
OUR STAGE MANAGER.
SAM PUT HIM UP TO IT.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.409
SAM?

25:36.577 --> 25:37.827
MY EX-HUSBAND.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.873
OH, GOD.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.875
YOU KNOW,

25:44.084 --> 25:47.045
YOU SHOULD STAY IN BED
AND FORCE LIQUIDS.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.047
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE
FOR A CAMEL.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.841
YOU HAVE ANYBODY
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.218
OH, IT'S ONLY A COLD.

25:53.427 --> 25:54.844
A COLD TONIGHT

25:55.054 --> 25:56.888
COULD BE PNEUMONIA
BY THE MORNING.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.890
ARE YOU SURE YOUR HUSBAND
WAS A HYPOCHONDRIAC

25:59.099 --> 26:00.683
BEFORE
HE MARRIED YOU?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.373
I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT I'M AN ALARMIST.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.229
ONLY BECAUSE
YOU SOUND LIKE ONE.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.897
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

26:06.106 --> 26:09.067
TO KNOW THAT WHEN IT
COMES TO YOUR HEALTH,

26:09.276 --> 26:11.486
IT DOES NOT PAY
TO TAKE CHANCES.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.196
THEN YOU CAN STOP
WORRYING.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.491
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
SAXOPHONE LESSONS AND THE METRO,

26:16.700 --> 26:18.618
I NEVER PAY
TO TAKE ANYTHING.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.248
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO?

26:23.457 --> 26:24.874
WHAT?

26:25.084 --> 26:26.604
I'M GOING TO SEE IF
MY CLOTHES ARE DRY,

26:26.752 --> 26:30.088
AND THEN I'M GOING TO TRY
TO SNEAK BACK INTO MY HOTEL.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.507
WHAT IF I WAKE UP
WITH PNEUMONIA?

26:32.716 --> 26:34.861
WELL, I'LL JUST HAVE TO COME
ROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING

26:34.885 --> 26:36.427
AND CHECK ON YOU.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.430
I COULD HAVE A RELAPSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.890
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.267
WHY COULDN'T I?

26:42.476 --> 26:43.768
BECAUSE THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

26:43.978 --> 26:45.228
WAS ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.731
♪♪ HIYUM ♪♪

26:48.941 --> 26:51.734

26:51.944 --> 26:53.695

26:53.904 --> 26:56.447

26:56.657 --> 26:57.907
OH, MY GOD!

26:58.117 --> 26:59.200
WHAT?

26:59.410 --> 27:00.451
OH!

27:00.661 --> 27:01.744
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.037
AWW...

27:03.247 --> 27:06.124
IT WAS GUARANTEED
NOT TO SHRINK!

27:06.333 --> 27:09.586
MY BEST DRESS. LOOK!

27:09.795 --> 27:10.878
LET'S SEE.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.549
OH, THERE'S
NOTHING TO LET DOWN.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.551
I CAN'T GO OUT
LIKE THIS!

27:16.760 --> 27:18.678
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE COAT?

27:22.099 --> 27:23.683
OH!

27:26.729 --> 27:28.938
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.441
SELL MATCHES.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.031
AW, POOR BABY.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.580
I'M SORRY.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.582
THIS HASN'T BEEN
MY DAY.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.584
GOD, THERE
HAVE BEEN TIMES

27:49.793 --> 27:51.961
I'D HAVE
GIVEN MY SOUL

27:52.171 --> 27:54.505
TO BE ABLE TO CRY
LIKE THAT.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.090
OH, I HATE IT.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.968
YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU
COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.511
WELL.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.597
NOW...

28:02.806 --> 28:05.975
TOMORROW, I'LL GO OVER
AND PICK UP YOUR CLOTHES.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.602
OH, THEY WON'T LET YOU.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.979
THEY WILL
IF I PAY YOUR BILL.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.189
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.608
WHY NOT? THIS
IS THAT RAINY DAY

28:13.817 --> 28:15.985
I'VE SAVED UP
A FEW FRANCS FOR.

28:16.195 --> 28:16.986
HERE.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.988
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.365
WHAT?

28:20.574 --> 28:23.034
"NEITHER A BORROWER
NOR A LENDER BE."

28:23.243 --> 28:26.537
"FOR A LOAN OFT LOSES
BOTH ITSELF AND FRIEND."

28:26.747 --> 28:27.830
EXACTLY.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.457
YOU WERE WILLING
TO COMPROMISE

28:29.667 --> 28:31.626
YOUR VIRTUE
FOR A MEATBALL.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.629
WELL, I WAS OUT OF MY MIND
AT THE TIME,

28:34.838 --> 28:36.839
AND AT LEAST IT WAS
SOMETHING FOR SOMETHING.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.383
ALL RIGHT.

28:38.592 --> 28:40.635
WE'LL MAKE THIS STRICTLY
A BUSINESS PROPOSITION.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.637
I'LL CHARGE YOU
A WEEKLY INTEREST

28:42.846 --> 28:45.181
EQUIVALENT TO THE GOING
RATE OF ONE MEATBALL.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.684
OH, DAMN.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.394
TODDY...

28:49.603 --> 28:51.145
YOU'RE SWEET
AND GENEROUS.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.730
EXHAUSTED.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.732
HOW WOULD I EVER
PAY YOU BACK?

28:54.942 --> 28:56.401
WELL, WE'LL SOLVE THAT
TOMORROW.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.861
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M GIVING THE ORDERS.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.989
YOU ARE GOING TO GET INTO
THOSE PAJAMAS AND COME TO BED.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.574
THERE?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.243
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO THE SOFA,

29:05.411 --> 29:07.662
BUT YOU HAVE
MY WORD OF HONOR

29:07.871 --> 29:09.831
THIS IS MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE

29:10.040 --> 29:11.290
AND INFINITELY SAFER.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.840
OH, GOD.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.426
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE INCONVENIENT

29:21.635 --> 29:24.846
THAN AN OLD QUEEN
WITH A HEAD COLD.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.023
I WON'T BE LONG.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.907
I RESENT BEING TREATED
LIKE A HELPLESS INVALID!

29:45.117 --> 29:47.535
OH, WILL YOU
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT?

29:47.745 --> 29:50.121
NOW, I'LL CASH THE CHECK,
PAY MY HOTEL BILL,

29:50.330 --> 29:52.749
AND BE BACK IN TIME
TO FIX LUNCH.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.543
I CAN BLOODY WELL
FIX MY OWN LUNCH.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.545
NOT WITH A FEVER,
YOU CAN'T.

29:57.755 --> 30:00.548
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
I'VE GOT A FEVER?

30:00.758 --> 30:02.550
BECAUSE YOU'RE BURNING UP,
THAT'S WHY.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.926
I'M NATURALLY
WARM-BLOODED.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.137
TO BE THAT NATURALLY
WARM-BLOODED,

30:06.346 --> 30:08.556
YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A SAINT BERNARD.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.559
YOU LOOK BETTER IN RICHARD'S
CLOTHES THAN HE DOES.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.311
OF COURSE, HE LOOKS
BETTER OUT OF THEM.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.771
WELL?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.416
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU DON'T HAVE A FEVER.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.959
IN FACT, YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A TEMPERATURE!

30:17.983 --> 30:19.567
NOW, LEAVE IT THERE.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.152
DOES RICHARD HAVE A HAT?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.862
IN THE CLOSET.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.951
TODDY?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.703
RICHARD!

30:34.833 --> 30:37.335
GOOD MORNING, RICHARD.
YOU LOOK LIKE A RACCOON.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.128
I CAME BY TO PICK UP
MY THINGS.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.922
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TO PAY ME THE MONEY

30:41.131 --> 30:42.507
YOU OWED ME.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.469
I DON'T OWE YOU A THING,
YOU PATHETIC OLD QUEER.

30:49.306 --> 30:51.307
UNH! AH!

30:51.517 --> 30:52.308
YOU BASTARD!

30:52.518 --> 30:54.519
GET UP!

30:54.728 --> 30:57.772
YOU GET BACK IN BED!

30:57.981 --> 30:59.649
NOW...

30:59.858 --> 31:00.983
NEXT TIME,

31:01.193 --> 31:04.612
PICK ON SOMEONE
YOUR OWN SIZE.

31:04.822 --> 31:05.822
OOH!

31:05.906 --> 31:07.782
AND DON'T COME BACK!

31:07.991 --> 31:09.242
GOOD.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.551
GOD, MY NOSE.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.010
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.805
THERE WAS A MAN
WEARING MY CLOTHES.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.890
I THINK
HE BROKE MY NOSE!

31:33.100 --> 31:35.017
TODDY, YOU'RE DELIRIOUS.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.018
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.019
TODDY...
LOWER.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.020
TODDY.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.397
CARUSO, NOT CHALIAPIN.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.084
IF YOU DON'T GET BACK
INTO THAT BED...

31:41.108 --> 31:41.816
GOOD! WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY,
IT DROPS NATURALLY.

31:42.025 --> 31:42.817
THINK ANGRY.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.026
OH, MY...

31:44.194 --> 31:45.255
OH, GOD!
WHAT AN INSPIRATION!

31:45.279 --> 31:46.279
I'M GOING TO
GET A DOCTOR.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.405
VICTORIA,
IT WILL WORK!

31:47.447 --> 31:48.739
OH, TODDY,
IT WILL NOT.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.593
IF YOU LISTEN TO ME
AND DO EXACTLY AS I SAY,

31:50.617 --> 31:52.410
IN SIX WEEKS YOU'LL BE
THE TOAST OF PARIS,

31:52.619 --> 31:53.870
AND WE WILL BOTH
BE VERY RICH.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.079
OH...
VERY, VERY,

31:55.205 --> 31:56.414
VERY RICH.
BUT, OH, MY GOD.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.017
THINK! NO MORE BATH
LIGHT OPERA COMPANY.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.166
WELL, OF COUR...

31:59.376 --> 32:00.562
NO MORE MIKADO
AND SEEDY TENORS.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.586
YES, BUT...

32:01.795 --> 32:02.587
CAVIAR
INSTEAD OF MEATBALLS!

32:02.796 --> 32:03.838
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.047
TO GET SOME SCISSORS!

32:05.215 --> 32:06.841
PEOPLE BELIEVE
WHAT THEY SEE,

32:07.050 --> 32:08.259
AND THIS AFTERNOON,

32:08.468 --> 32:09.886
ANDRE CASSELL
IS GOING TO MEET

32:10.095 --> 32:11.596
EUROPE'S GREATEST
FEMALE IMPERSONATOR.

32:11.805 --> 32:12.889
ANDRE CASSELL

32:13.098 --> 32:14.599
IS THE BIGGEST AGENT
IN PARIS.

32:14.808 --> 32:15.850
IF I'M THE GREATEST,

32:16.059 --> 32:17.268
WHY HASN'T
HE HEARD OF ME?

32:17.477 --> 32:19.037
YOU'RE THE GREATEST,
BUT YOU'RE UNKNOWN,

32:19.062 --> 32:19.854
EXCEPT IN POLAND.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.272
POLAND?

32:21.481 --> 32:22.792
YOU'RE COUNT GRAZINSKY,
POLISH ARISTOCRAT,

32:22.816 --> 32:24.136
AND YOU SPEAK
VERY LITTLE ENGLISH.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.443
YOUR FAMILY DISOWNED YOU

32:25.652 --> 32:26.972
WHEN THEY DISCOVERED
YOU WERE GAY.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.446
OH, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

32:28.655 --> 32:29.864
WE MET IN WARSAW,
FELL IN LOVE,

32:30.073 --> 32:31.449
AND I BROUGHT YOU TO PARIS.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.450
AH, HOLD IT!

32:32.659 --> 32:33.701
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:33.911 --> 32:34.951
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S RIGHT?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.454
A WOMAN
PRETENDING TO BE A MAN

32:36.663 --> 32:37.455
PRETENDING
TO BE A WOMAN?

32:37.664 --> 32:38.664
RIDICULOUS.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.790
IT'S PREPOSTEROUS!

32:40.000 --> 32:41.144
IN FACT,
IT'S SO PREPOSTEROUS,

32:41.168 --> 32:42.460
NO ONE WOULD EVER
BELIEVE IT.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.063
AND YET, YOU EXPECT THEM
TO BELIEVE COUNT...

32:44.087 --> 32:44.879
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

32:45.088 --> 32:45.880
GRAZINSKY.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.882
GRAZINSKY, A GAY POLISH

32:48.091 --> 32:49.926
FEMALE IMPERSONATOR?

32:50.135 --> 32:51.886
DARLING, ALL ANYONE
HAS TO BELIEVE

32:52.095 --> 32:53.471
IS THAT YOU'RE A MAN.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.932
TO CONVINCE AN AUDIENCE
THAT AN ILLUSION IS REAL,

32:56.141 --> 32:58.476
THE MAGICIAN CREATES
A PLAUSIBLE DIVERSION.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.103
COUNT GRAZINSKY IS
OUR PLAUSIBLE DIVERSION.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.813
TODDY, NO AUDIENCE
IS THAT GULLIBLE.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.649
THEY'LL KNOW
HE'S A PHONY.

33:04.858 --> 33:05.650
RIGHT.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.068
WELL?

33:07.277 --> 33:09.487
THEY'LL KNOW
HE'S A PHONY.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.573
TODDY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO ACT LIKE A MAN.

33:12.783 --> 33:13.843
CONTRARY TO
THE POPULAR CONCEPTION

33:13.867 --> 33:14.867
OF HOW A MAN ACTS,

33:14.993 --> 33:16.160
THERE ARE
ALL SORTS OF MEN

33:16.370 --> 33:18.162
WHO ACT
IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.164
I MEAN, AS OPPOSED
TO THE WAY WOMEN ACT.

33:20.374 --> 33:21.457
I AM PERSONALLY
ACQUAINTED

33:21.667 --> 33:22.667
WITH
AT LEAST A DOZEN MEN

33:22.793 --> 33:24.335
WHO ACT EXACTLY
LIKE WOMEN

33:24.544 --> 33:26.128
AND VICE VERSA.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.538
THERE ARE JUST SOME THINGS
THAT ARE NATURALLY MASCULINE!

33:28.715 --> 33:29.757
NAME ONE.

33:29.967 --> 33:30.758
UM... UM...

33:30.968 --> 33:32.426
PEEING STANDING UP.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.364
HA HA. ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RULE

33:34.388 --> 33:36.180
THAT SAYS A MAN
CAN'T SIT DOWN.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.515
MEN HAVE ADAM'S APPLES.

33:37.724 --> 33:38.849
SO DO SOME WOMEN.

33:39.017 --> 33:39.767
NAME ONE.

33:39.977 --> 33:40.768
NANA LANOUX.

33:40.978 --> 33:41.769
WHAT?

33:41.979 --> 33:42.979
TAXI!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.188
NANA LANOUX?
WHO'S SHE?

33:44.398 --> 33:45.523
THE LAST WOMAN
I SLEPT WITH.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.441
WHEN WAS THAT?

33:47.651 --> 33:49.963
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MORNING I
DECIDED TO BECOME A HOMOSEXUAL.

33:49.987 --> 33:51.195
VERY DASHING.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.364
I CAN'T WEAR THIS
ALL THE TIME.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.991
WHY NOT? IT MIGHT
SET A FASHION.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.535
DID MISS LANOUX
HAVE A BIG ADAM'S APPLE?

33:57.744 --> 34:00.037
LIKE A COCONUT!

34:14.969 --> 34:16.219
GOOD MORNING.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.556
WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL
MR. CASSELL

34:18.764 --> 34:20.181
THAT CARROLL TODD
IS HERE?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.559
WHY?

34:21.768 --> 34:22.851
WHY?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.812
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT

34:25.022 --> 34:26.397
WITH MR. CASSELL,

34:26.606 --> 34:28.815
WHY SHOULD I TELL HIM
YOU'RE HERE?

34:29.025 --> 34:31.819
BECAUSE MR. CASSELL AND I
ARE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS,

34:32.029 --> 34:33.571
AND IF YOU TELL HIM
I'M HERE,

34:33.780 --> 34:35.572
HE'LL WANT TO SEE ME.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.574
THAT'S NOT VERY
COMPLICATED, IS IT?

34:37.784 --> 34:39.409
BEING A VERY
CLOSE FRIEND,

34:39.619 --> 34:41.036
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DON'T KNOW

34:41.246 --> 34:43.039
THAT EVERY WEDNESDAY
AT THIS TIME,

34:43.248 --> 34:45.041

FOR EVERYTHING.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.110
I DON'T THINK SO.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.279
BUT YOU'RE NOT
100% SURE.

49:09.488 --> 49:10.780
PRACTICALLY.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.116
AH, BUT TO A MAN
LIKE YOU...

49:13.284 --> 49:14.743
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES

49:14.952 --> 49:17.120
HE COULD NEVER
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

49:17.330 --> 49:19.122
FIND ANOTHER MAN
ATTRACTIVE,

49:19.332 --> 49:21.541
THE MARGIN BETWEEN
PRACTICALLY AND FOR SURE

49:21.751 --> 49:24.794
MUST BE AS WIDE
AS THE GRAND CANYON.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.964
IF YOU WERE A MAN,
I'D KNOCK YOUR BLOCK OFF.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.091
AND PROVE
THAT YOU'RE A MAN.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.801
THAT'S A WOMAN'S ARGUMENT.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.762
YOUR PROBLEM,
MR. MARCHAND,

49:33.971 --> 49:35.263
IS THAT
YOU'RE PREOCCUPIED

49:35.473 --> 49:36.556
WITH STEREOTYPES.

49:36.766 --> 49:38.558
I THINK
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS...

49:38.768 --> 49:40.560
YOU'RE
ONE KIND OF MAN,

49:40.770 --> 49:42.228
I'M ANOTHER.

49:42.438 --> 49:43.730
AND WHAT KIND ARE YOU?

49:43.940 --> 49:46.149
ONE THAT DOESN'T
HAVE TO PROVE IT

49:46.359 --> 49:47.817
TO MYSELF...

49:48.027 --> 49:49.235
OR ANYONE.

49:49.445 --> 49:51.279
EXCUSE ME.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.701
THANK YOU.

49:58.120 --> 50:02.082
I... YOU'RE KIDDING!

50:02.291 --> 50:06.503
YOU... YOU REALLY
ARE QUEER?

50:06.671 --> 50:09.798
OH! WE PREFER GAY.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.635
OH, BUT YOU'RE SO...
ATTRACTIVE.

50:15.221 --> 50:17.639
WELL, I JUST THINK
IT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.017
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK?

50:21.227 --> 50:22.602
WHAT?

50:22.812 --> 50:27.023
I THINK THAT THE RIGHT WOMAN
COULD REFORM YOU.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.609
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THE RIGHT WOMAN

50:29.819 --> 50:30.860
COULD REFORM YOU, TOO.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.863
OH! ME GIVE UP MEN?
FORGET IT!

50:34.073 --> 50:37.158
YOU TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.201
NORMA?

50:38.369 --> 50:39.869
OH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

50:40.079 --> 50:42.872
I STILL THINK
IT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.708
WELL, IF IT'S
ANY CONSOLATION,

50:44.917 --> 50:47.043
I ASSURE YOU
IT IS NOT WASTED.

50:47.253 --> 50:48.712
OH!

50:48.921 --> 50:49.671
NORMA.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.423
WHAT? JEEZ...

50:56.721 --> 50:58.096
AU REVOIR.

50:58.305 --> 51:01.057
ME, TOO.

51:01.267 --> 51:04.644
COME ON. GET OUT
OF MY WAY. GO ON.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.482
SEE YOU IN CHURCH.

51:09.692 --> 51:11.026
OH...

51:16.907 --> 51:19.325
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME ALONE
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

51:19.535 --> 51:21.911
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF KING MARCHAND?

51:22.121 --> 51:23.913
KING MARCHAND IS
AN ARROGANT, OPINIONATED,

51:24.123 --> 51:25.540
CHAUVINISTIC PAIN
IN THE ASS.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.185
I THINK I COULD FALL
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.002
I THINK I COULD, TOO.

51:29.211 --> 51:32.088
I'M TELLIN' YA,
HE'S GAY.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.715
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.091
WE HAD A LONG TALK.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.093
THEY MET IN POLAND
OR SOMETHING,

51:37.303 --> 51:39.012
AND HE BROUGHT HIM
TO PARIS,

51:39.221 --> 51:41.556
AND HE'S MAKING HIM
A BIG STAR.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.224
THEY'RE LOVERS.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.894
AND I KNOW WHY YOU
DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.145
HA!

51:49.106 --> 51:50.899
CAN I GIVE YOU A LIFT
TO YOUR HOTEL?

51:51.108 --> 51:52.525
THAT'S KIND
OF YOU, BUT...

51:52.735 --> 51:54.110
WE'D BE DELIGHTED.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.111
HOTEL?

51:55.321 --> 51:56.321
WHY NOT?

52:04.121 --> 52:06.539
I HEARD YOU, NORMA.
I HEARD YOU.

52:06.749 --> 52:09.459
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SO BURNED UP ABOUT.

52:09.668 --> 52:10.960
THANK YOU.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.850
I MEAN, IT WAS A PERFECTLY
NATURAL MISTAKE.

52:12.922 --> 52:14.089
KNOCK IT OFF, NORMA.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.549
WELL, SQUASH THOUGHT
HE WAS A WOMAN.

52:16.759 --> 52:20.053
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT'S REALLY VERY FUNNY.

52:20.262 --> 52:21.971
HE ISN'T BAD-LOOKING,

52:22.181 --> 52:24.557
BUT I KNEW HE WAS
A MAN RIGHT AWAY.

52:24.767 --> 52:26.976
IT'S THE PADDING.

52:27.186 --> 52:29.979
I DON'T CARE HOW CLEVER
THOSE COSTUMES ARE.

52:30.147 --> 52:33.566
I MEAN, THERE ARE JUST
SOME THINGS YOU CANNOT FAKE.

52:33.776 --> 52:36.569
I MEAN EVEN WITH ALL
THOSE HORMONE SHOTS

52:36.779 --> 52:39.948
AND EVERYTHING, A REAL
WOMAN CAN ALWAYS TELL.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.574
CAN YOU IMAGINE

52:41.784 --> 52:43.576
WHAT SAL ANDRETTI
WOULD SAY

52:43.786 --> 52:45.995
IF HE KNEW
HIS PARTNER FELL

52:46.205 --> 52:48.957
FOR A FEMALE
IMPERSONATOR? HUH?

52:49.166 --> 52:50.959
CHECK UNDER THE BED?

52:51.168 --> 52:52.627
YES.

52:52.837 --> 52:54.587
NOW...

52:54.797 --> 52:57.173
I KNOW HE'S SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT YOU,

52:57.383 --> 53:01.177
BUT DOES HE HAVE TO STAY
IN THE SAME SUITE WITH US?

53:01.387 --> 53:04.597
I MEAN, I JUST KEEP
EXPECTING HIM TO BREAK IN

53:04.807 --> 53:07.600
WHILE WE'RE, UH,
WE'RE MAKING LOVE.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.603
HE'D ONLY DO THAT IF HE
HEARD SOMETHING UNUSUAL,

53:10.813 --> 53:12.814
LIKE IF I GOT EXCITED.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.817
WELL, YOU...
YOU BIG JERK...

53:16.026 --> 53:19.612
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU CREEP.

53:19.822 --> 53:22.532
YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS...

53:26.162 --> 53:27.620
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.497
GOOD EVENING.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.624
THANK YOU, ANDRE.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.042
GOOD NIGHT, TODDY.

53:33.252 --> 53:35.628
VICTOR, GET SOME SLEEP.

53:35.838 --> 53:37.380
TODDY, THIS IS
THE MARCEAU.

53:37.590 --> 53:38.381
HM-HMM.

53:38.591 --> 53:39.591
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

53:39.758 --> 53:40.758
UP.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.263
ENTREZ!

53:47.433 --> 53:49.058
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.852
TODDY, WHAT ARE
YOU UP TO?

53:51.061 --> 53:51.853
TODDY?

53:52.062 --> 53:52.854
TA-DA!

53:53.063 --> 53:54.147
AHH...

54:00.905 --> 54:03.489
HOLY MERDE.

54:06.911 --> 54:08.494
TODDY, WHEN DID
WE MOVE?

54:08.704 --> 54:10.038
DURING DRESS REHEARSAL.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.125
BUT WHAT IF
I'D FLOPPED?

54:14.335 --> 54:16.502
OOH, THEN, WE WOULD HAVE
ORDERED A SUMPTUOUS MEAL,

54:16.712 --> 54:19.547
CHARGED IT TO ROOM SERVICE,
DRUNK THE CHAMPAGNE...

54:19.757 --> 54:20.997
COMPLIMENTS OF
THE MANAGEMENT...

54:21.133 --> 54:22.717
AND JUMPED OUT
THE WINDOW.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.929
WHICH IS WHY I CHOSE
A THREE-STAR HOTEL

54:26.138 --> 54:27.532
AND SPECIFICALLY
REQUESTED ACCOMMODATIONS

54:27.556 --> 54:29.224
ABOVE THE THIRD FLOOR.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.433
MONSIEUR.

54:30.476 --> 54:31.935
OH, TODDY.

54:32.144 --> 54:35.104
OH, THE BATHROOM IS
A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.941
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.360
OHH... WHEN CAN WE AFFORD
ANOTHER BEDROOM?

54:40.569 --> 54:43.905
AS SOON AS WE'RE SURE YOU'RE
NOT JUST A FLASH IN THE PAN.

54:44.114 --> 54:45.281
MY GOD!

54:45.491 --> 54:48.534
BESIDES,
ONE BEDROOM, ONE BED,

54:48.744 --> 54:51.287
PROMOTES THE ILLUSION
THAT WE'RE LOVERS.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.081
IF FOR SOME REASON

54:53.290 --> 54:54.958
WE DECIDE WE'D
RATHER SLEEP APART,

54:55.167 --> 54:56.292
THERE'S MORE THAN
ENOUGH ROOM

54:56.502 --> 54:57.961
FOR ONE OF US
IN THE BATHTUB.

54:58.170 --> 55:00.129
YEAH. AND IF WE HAVE
AN OVERNIGHT GUEST,

55:00.339 --> 55:02.715
HE CAN ALWAYS STRETCH OUT
IN THE BIDET.

55:02.925 --> 55:04.092
RIGHT.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.346
I LOVE YOU.

55:08.555 --> 55:10.682
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, SIR.

55:12.101 --> 55:14.560
OHH... AHH!

57:12.971 --> 57:14.931
WELL, I WILL
IF YOU WILL.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.100
IF I COULD,
I WOULD BE THE STAR,

57:17.309 --> 57:19.352
AND YOU WOULD
STILL BE TRYING

57:19.561 --> 57:22.522
TO SWAP YOUR VIRTUE
FOR A MEATBALL.

57:22.731 --> 57:24.941
SPEAKING OF VIRTUE...

57:25.150 --> 57:26.275
YECCH.

57:26.485 --> 57:29.946
WERE YOU SERIOUS
ABOUT KING MARCHAND?

57:30.155 --> 57:31.948
WERE YOU?

57:32.116 --> 57:34.367
I ASKED YOU FIRST.

57:34.576 --> 57:36.494
THAT'S AN INFANTILE
EVASION.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.997
O.K.

57:40.207 --> 57:42.959
I FIND HIM
EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE.

57:43.168 --> 57:44.585
CHECK.

57:44.795 --> 57:48.131
IN FACT, I WOULDN'T MIND
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HIM.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.258
I'LL BUY THAT.

57:57.558 --> 57:59.434
YOU KNOW...

57:59.643 --> 58:04.981
PRETENDING TO BE A MAN
HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES.

58:05.190 --> 58:08.985
MY DEAR COUNT...
YOU JUST SAID

58:09.194 --> 58:11.779
A COTTONPICKIN'
MOUTHFUL.

58:18.912 --> 58:21.456
POOKIE...

58:29.423 --> 58:32.216
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

58:40.851 --> 58:45.354
IT HAPPENS
TO EVERYONE.

58:45.564 --> 58:47.356
MEN, I MEAN.

58:47.566 --> 58:49.358
WE'RE LUCKY.

58:49.568 --> 58:51.527
WOMEN, I MEAN.

58:51.737 --> 58:54.363
WE CAN FAKE IT
IF WE HAVE TO.

58:54.573 --> 59:00.286
OH! OH, DON'T
GET ME WRONG.

59:00.496 --> 59:04.373
I NEVER HAVE
WITH YOU.

59:04.583 --> 59:06.709
FAKED IT, I MEAN.

59:06.919 --> 59:09.128
WITH YOU,

59:09.338 --> 59:15.009
IT'S... IT'S LIKE
POW! POW! POW!

59:15.219 --> 59:17.386
LIKE THE FOURTH
OF JULY.

59:17.596 --> 59:18.804
EVERY TIME.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.556
JUST TONIGHT,

59:20.766 --> 59:23.017
BECAUSE YOU
COULDN'T GET IT...

59:23.227 --> 59:25.394
UP TILL NOW,
IT'S BEEN GRAND.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.397
POOKIE, REALLY,
REALLY GRAND.

59:28.607 --> 59:31.526
AND IF THERE'S
ONE THING

59:31.735 --> 59:34.195
I KNOW FOR SURE,

59:34.404 --> 59:36.405
YOU CAN'T LET IT
GET YOU...

59:36.615 --> 59:38.407
YOU SHOULD EXCUSE
THE EXPRESSION...

59:38.617 --> 59:39.617
DOWN.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.410
YOU CAN'T THINK
ABOUT IT.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.180
YOU JUST GOT TO
PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.747
I MEAN, THE MORE
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

59:44.957 --> 59:46.207
THE MORE YOU WORRY.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.668
THE MORE YOU WORRY,
THE MORE YOU THINK.

59:48.877 --> 59:51.379
THINK, WORRY...
UMM... IT'S SOFT.

59:51.588 --> 59:52.713
WORRY, THINK...

59:52.923 --> 59:57.093
IT'S... IT JUST GETS LIKE
A VICIOUS CYCLE.

59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.429
AND THEN,
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.016
YOU ARE IMPUDENT.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.352
WHAT'S WITH THE SOAP?

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.897
ARGHH!

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.858
AAH!

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:14.860
LOOK OUT!

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.280
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:18.573
NOW, NORMA...

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:21.909
NO! NOBODY PUTS SOAP
IN MY MOUTH!

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.954
NOT EVEN...
NOT EVEN MY MOTHER!

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.790
YOU'RE BEING
VERY CHILDISH.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.876
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, TOO.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:33.087
YOU BIG, MUSCLEBOUND...
OOH!

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.097
LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO CONTROL YOURSELF.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:38.050
AAH! OOH! GAHH!

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.260
OH, SHIT!

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.469
AAH!

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.389
THIS IS IT!
LET ME... AAH!

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.811
YOU AND YOUR IDEAS.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.148
"WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER
TO PARIS WITH YOU, BOSS?"

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:54.817
I JUST THOUGHT
SHE'D HELP YOU RELAX.

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:56.152
SHE'D NEVER
HELP ME RELAX.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.987
WELL, THEN,
SEND HER HOME.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.073

HI, SAL.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:22.502
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.879
NORMA,
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.465
IT-T-T-T'S...

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:28.675
IT-T-T-T'S...

01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:29.884
KING!

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:31.845
SHACKING UP
WITH ANOTHER DAME.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.221
NO. ANOTHER GUY.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.725
OH, IT'S SO TERRIBLE.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.018
I JUST...

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:41.688
RUN THAT
BY ME AGAIN.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.607
WELL, THERE'S THIS
POLISH FAIRY, YOU SEE?

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.208
EVEN WHEN I WAS
A SECOND-RATE SOPRANO,

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.418
I HAD A PROPER DRESSER.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.460
YOU HAD
A PROPER DRESSER

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:05.336
WHO COULD SWEAR
THAT YOU WERE

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:06.546
A SECOND-RATE
SOPRANO,

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.214
AND NOT A FIRST-CLASS
IMPOSTOR.

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:09.716
YOU TRUST
MY DRESSMAKER.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.685
AND HE TRUSTS ME NOT
TO REVEAL CERTAIN THINGS

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.002
THAT WOULD BE VERY
EMBARRASSING

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.387
TO HIS WIFE
AND SIX CHILDREN.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:16.347
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:18.349
SHAME IS
AN UNHAPPY EMOTION

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.767
INVENTED BY PIETISTS

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:21.769
IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT
THE HUMAN RACE.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.897
WHO SAID THAT?

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.273
I SAID THAT.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.275
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN SHAME?

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:28.902
I BELIEVE
IN HAPPINESS.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.071
COMRADES.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.660
KING MARCHAND HAS
JUST OFFERED ME A FORTUNE

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.621
FOR YOU TO APPEAR
AT HIS CLUB.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.914
WOULD YOU PLEASE

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:41.706
BE MORE SPECIFIC
WITH YOUR NOUNS?

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:43.082
$10,000 A WEEK.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.627
THAT'S NOT A NOUN.
THAT'S A FORTUNE.

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:48.046
HE WANTS TO HAVE DINNER
WITH YOU AFTER THE SHOW.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.631
YOU THINK YOU COULD
MAKE IT?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.049
OH, I THINK SO.

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:52.634
I'LL TELL HIM.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.636
$10,000 A WEEK,
10 WEEKS GUARANTEED.

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:56.596
WE ARE ON OUR WAY.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.774
♪♪ I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING ♪♪

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:12.111
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:30.046
TO THE COUNT'S OPENING
NIGHT IN CHICAGO.

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:32.757
TO THE CLOSING NIGHT,
MAY IT NEVER COME.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:37.679
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION,

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:38.972
MR. MARCHAND?

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.140
HE WILL WHETHER
YOU MIND OR NOT.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.685
I WORRY MORE ABOUT
ANSWERS THAN QUESTIONS.

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.687
IT'S RATHER OBVIOUS
THAT MR. BERNSTEIN

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:48.690
IS ON HAND TO ENSURE
YOUR CONTINUED GOOD HEALTH.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.108
THAT'S NOT
A QUESTION.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:51.693
UH-HUH.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:54.028
WHY IS HE SITTING
WAY OVER THERE?

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.321
STRATEGIC.

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.115
AH. BROADER
FIELD OF VISION,

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:58.700
CLEARER FIELD
OF FIRE.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.119
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
IN THE ARMY.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.704
ONCE OR TWICE.

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:04.872
DO YOU MIND IF I JOIN HIM?
HE LOOKS SO LONELY.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:06.708
NO, I DON'T MIND.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:09.127
I PROMISE NOT TO INHIBIT
HIS FIELD OF FIRE.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.087
INCORRIGIBLE.

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:15.967
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN MR. TODD?

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.177
OH, A LONG TIME.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.888
MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.057
A CLEVER MAN
ONCE SAID,

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:24.851
"IT'S NOT
THE QUESTIONS

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.728
I'M WORRIED ABOUT."

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.188
WHAT'S THE ATTRACTION?

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:32.275
WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.569
IF I TOLD YOU
WE WERE IN LOVE?

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:35.778
NO.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.488
BECAUSE
HOMOSEXUALITY

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.490
IS UNNATURAL
AND A SIN?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.534
ACCORDING TO WHOM?

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:44.495
OH, PIOUS CLERGYMEN

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:46.914
AND TERRIFIED
HETEROSEXUALS.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.875
OH, THEM.

01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:51.044
YOU'RE SMILING,

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.920
AND I DON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.506
AND YOU'RE NOT SMILING,
AND YOU SHOULD BE.

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.425
I THINK I'D BETTER
GO WASH MY HANDS.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.010
EXCUSE ME.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:03.723
DO YOU EVER GET
THE FEELING SOMETIMES

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.684
THAT YOU'RE
A SINKING SHIP?

01:25:06.894 --> 01:25:08.102
CONSTANTLY.

01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:10.104
AH, NOW, THERE.
YOU'RE SMILING.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:11.939
YOU LIGHT UP
WHEN YOU SMILE.

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:13.775
THAT'S A FUNNY
THING TO SAY.

01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:14.984
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:16.569
I MEAN,
ONE MAN TO ANOTHER.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.158
SEEMS TODDY
AND MR. BERNSTEIN

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.285
HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:26.245
YEAH, UH...

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.414
CASSELL WAS
TELLING ME THAT, UH...

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:31.626
MR. TODD WAS THE HEADLINER
AT CHEZ LUI.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:33.044
YOU KNOW CHEZ LUI?

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.046
NO, BUT I WAS THINKING

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:36.964
THAT, UH, WE MIGHT
DROP BY LATER,

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:39.258
AND YOU COULD
EDUCATE ME.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.260
I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT EDUCATING YOU

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.887
WOULD BE ABOUT
AS REDUNDANT

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:44.931
AS TEACHING A LION
TO LIKE RED MEAT.

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.060
CIGAR?

01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:03.241

HEY, SQUASH, LOOK,

01:35:57.127 --> 01:35:59.336
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

01:35:59.546 --> 01:36:01.046
NO, YOU DON'T.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.757
IN ONE FELL SWOOP,

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:05.092
YOU'VE CHANGED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:07.219
IT WASN'T
THAT KIND OF SWOOP.

01:36:08.722 --> 01:36:10.556
LISTEN, BOSS...

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:13.559
IF A GUY LIKE YOU
HAS GOT THE GUTS

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.060
TO ADMIT HE'S GAY...

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:20.065
SO CAN I.

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.656
YOU'VE MADE ME
SO HAPPY.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:45.090
HA! YOU KNOW, I...

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.397
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:02.274
OH, NOTHING,
NOTHING.

01:37:03.777 --> 01:37:05.986
I'M FINDING
THIS TRIP TO PARIS

01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:07.613
A LITTLE MORE...

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.990
BIZARRE THAN USUAL.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.992
OHH...

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:13.744
THANKS A LOT.

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:16.997
OH, OH, NOT YOU. NO.

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:19.124
IT'S NOT YOU.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:20.751
WHY NOT ME?

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.086
I MEAN, A WOMAN PRETENDING
TO BE A MAN PRETENDING...

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:25.005
YOU CAN STOP
PRETENDING.

01:37:25.215 --> 01:37:26.590
AND DO WHAT?

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.841
BE YOURSELF.

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:29.343
AND WHAT'S THAT?

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:30.761
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:32.281
YOU'RE A WOMAN
IN LOVE WITH A MAN.

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:34.181
YES.

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.183
ARE WE
COMMUNICATING?

01:37:36.392 --> 01:37:38.185
YOU SAID A WOMAN
IN LOVE WITH A MAN,

01:37:38.394 --> 01:37:39.853
BUT YOU DIDN'T FINISH.

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:42.189
O.K.,
WHAT'S THE FINISH?

01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:45.150
A WOMAN IN LOVE
WITH A MAN,

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.152
PRETENDING
TO BE A MAN...

01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:49.780
I SAID YOU CAN
STOP PRETENDING.

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:52.282
BUT YOU SEE,
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO.

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:56.578
I'M A BIG STAR NOW.
I'M A SUCCESS.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:58.163
OH, THAT.

01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:00.874
AND SOMETHING MORE.

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:04.753
I FIND IT ALL
REALLY FASCINATING.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:09.591
I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS
AVAILABLE TO ME AS A MAN

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:12.052
THAT I COULD
NEVER HAVE AS A WOMAN.

01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:13.345
I'M EMANCIPATED.

01:38:13.555 --> 01:38:15.180
EMANCIPATED?

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.225
WELL, I'M MY OWN MAN,
SO TO SPEAK.

01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:21.186
OH, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO RELATE TO THAT.

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:22.688
WELL, TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU,

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.690
RIGHT NOW, I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:27.818
RELATING TO ANYTHING.

01:38:28.027 --> 01:38:30.195
LOOK, IF WE'RE TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF FUTURE TOGETHER,

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:32.197
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

01:38:32.407 --> 01:38:33.824
I WANT
TO UNDERSTAND.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:36.201
WELL, YOU THINK IT WOULD BE
FAIR FOR ME TO ASK YOU

01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:37.995
TO GIVE UP YOUR JOB?

01:38:38.204 --> 01:38:39.246
IT WOULD BE
RIDICULOUS.

01:38:39.455 --> 01:38:41.832
BUT YOU EXPECT ME
TO GIVE UP MINE.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.834
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.836
RIGHT, BUT THERE
SHOULDN'T BE.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:47.212
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ONE

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:48.839
PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEONE ELSE.

01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:51.675
LET'S PUT THE SHOE
ON THE OTHER FOOT.

01:38:51.885 --> 01:38:53.760
LET'S SAY THAT
YOU'RE A MAN,

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:55.220
AND I'M A WOMAN

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.055
PRETENDING
TO BE A MAN.

01:38:57.265 --> 01:38:58.932
WELL, I THINK IT
WOULD DEPEND A WHOLE LOT

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:00.851
ON WHY YOU WERE PRETENDING.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.420
OH, COME ON NOW,
VICTORIA, YOU SAID

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:03.854
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I UNDERSTAND.

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:05.416
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU UNDERSTAND, TOO.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.440
CERTAINLY.

01:39:06.566 --> 01:39:07.858
LOVE IS
A TWO-WAY STREET.

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:09.276
WHY DID I SAY THAT?

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:11.862
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:14.239
UH, YOU SAID IF WE
WERE GOING TO HAVE

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:15.866
ANY KIND OF FUTURE,

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:17.784
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY FUTURE?

01:39:17.994 --> 01:39:19.036
LIVE TOGETHER?

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:20.245
POSSIBLY.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:21.246
SLEEP TOGETHER?

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:22.456
HOPEFULLY.

01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:24.458
WHILE YOU
KEEP ON WORKING?

01:39:24.626 --> 01:39:25.626
YES.

01:39:25.835 --> 01:39:27.878
PRETENDING
TO BE A MAN.

01:39:28.087 --> 01:39:30.255
IF I DIDN'T,
I WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.257
UH-HUH.
WHILE WE'RE LIVING

01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:33.634
AND SLEEPING
TOGETHER,

01:39:33.843 --> 01:39:35.302
WHAT'S EVERYBODY
GOING TO THINK?

01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:37.072
I GUESS THEY'RE GOING TO
THINK THAT YOU'RE LIVING

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:38.263
AND SLEEPING WITH A MAN.

01:39:38.473 --> 01:39:39.932
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:42.267
WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
THE SAME THING ABOUT ME.

01:39:42.477 --> 01:39:43.477
BUT YOU'RE A WOMAN!

01:39:43.686 --> 01:39:45.062
YEAH, BUT
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.271
YOU DO!

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:48.273
AND YOU KNOW
YOU'RE A MAN!

01:39:48.483 --> 01:39:49.942
I DON'T SEE
THE DIFFERENCE.

01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:52.277
WE'D BE LIVING
A DAMN LIE.

01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:53.654
I DON'T THINK

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.781
THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY
BOTHERING YOU.

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:57.491
IF YOU THINK
I'M WORRIED

01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.493
ABOUT EVERYBODY
THINKING I'M A FAG,

01:39:59.661 --> 01:40:00.744
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:04.164
SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:40:04.374 --> 01:40:05.791
I GUESS WE HAVE.

01:40:12.465 --> 01:40:14.508
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:16.510
THAT'S AS BAD

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:18.804
AS "LOVE IS
A TWO-WAY STREET."

01:40:19.973 --> 01:40:22.432
WHAT IT LACKS
IN ORIGINALITY,

01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:25.310
IT MAKES UP FOR
IN PROPHECY.

01:40:26.813 --> 01:40:29.064
SOONER OR LATER,
I'D PROBABLY ASK YOU

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:32.025
TO STOP BEING A GANGSTER
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.611
ABOUT EVERYONE THINKING
I WAS YOUR MOLL.

01:40:34.821 --> 01:40:36.446
I AM NOT A GANGSTER.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:38.490
JUST A BUSINESSMAN
WITH A BODYGUARD.

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.783
A BUSINESSMAN

01:40:39.993 --> 01:40:41.053
WHO DOES BUSINESS
WITH GANGSTERS

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:42.202
AND DOESN'T HAVE
A BODYGUARD

01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:43.787
IS SOON
OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:46.456
A BUSINESSMAN WHO DOES
BUSINESS WITH GANGSTERS

01:40:46.666 --> 01:40:48.458
AND PRETENDS
HE'S NOT A GANGSTER

01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:50.836
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE
THE KIND OF ACT I DO.

01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:54.840
I THINK WE'RE
BOTH PRETENDERS,

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:57.467
AND THAT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD BASIS

01:40:57.677 --> 01:40:58.969
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:10.605
OH, BUT IT WAS FUN
WHILE IT LASTED.

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:39.968
HAVE A NICE EVENING?

01:41:40.178 --> 01:41:41.887
UP TO A POINT.

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:43.513
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

01:41:43.723 --> 01:41:45.932
OH, NOTHING MUCH.
WE WERE ALL ARRESTED.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:49.019
ANDRE CALLED HIS LAWYER,
WHO BAILED US OUT.

01:41:53.066 --> 01:41:54.483
YOU REMEMBER
MR. BERNSTEIN.

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:55.901
COUNT GRAZINSKY.

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:00.405
MR. BERNSTEIN.

01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:05.327
HEY, SQUASH,
CAN I ASK YOU

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:06.703
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:08.038
GO AHEAD.

01:42:09.707 --> 01:42:10.957
HOW LONG... I MEAN...

01:42:11.167 --> 01:42:13.919
EXACTLY WHEN DID YOU
KNOW ABOUT, UH...

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.921
WHEN DID I KNOW
I WAS GAY?

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:17.255
YEAH.

01:42:17.465 --> 01:42:18.734
GOD, I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN I WASN'T.

01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:20.550
I'VE KNOWN YOU
FOR 15 YEARS.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.928
YOU KNEW A LOT
OF GUYS, BOSS.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.554
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:26.556
YOU WERE
AN ALL-AMERICAN.

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:28.975
I NEVER SAW
A MEANER, ROUGHER,

01:42:29.185 --> 01:42:30.936
TOUGHER, SON-OF-A-BITCH
FOOTBALL PLAYER

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.270
IN ALL MY LIFE.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.665
LISTEN, IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT THE GUYS

01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:34.940
TO CALL YOU QUEER,

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.942
YOU BECAME
A ROUGH, TOUGH,

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:39.694
SON-OF-A-BITCHIN'
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:44.950
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, HUH?

01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:50.997
HE SAYS IT
WAS YOUR FAULT

01:42:51.207 --> 01:42:52.647
AND, UH, SUGGESTS
THAT YOU APOLOGIZE.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:53.500
OH, HE DOES.

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:54.501
COME ON.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.002
NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:57.963
WELL, YOU TELL HIM
IF HE'D LIKE AN APOLOGY,

01:42:58.172 --> 01:42:59.589
HE CAN JUST
GET HIM SOME GLOVES,

01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:01.967

THIS WAY, WE GO TO BED
REASONABLY EARLY,

AND WE CAN SPEND A FEW
AFTERNOONS TOGETHER.

01:51:26.597 --> 01:51:28.139
WHAT?

01:51:28.349 --> 01:51:30.516
SKIP
A FEW AFTERNOONS

01:51:30.726 --> 01:51:32.018
AND GO DANCING.

01:51:32.227 --> 01:51:33.728

WANTED TO GO DANCING

01:53:02.443 --> 01:53:04.235
THAT'D BE
A LITTLE UNORTHODOX

01:53:04.445 --> 01:53:05.737

01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:08.948

THE PROBLEM IS,

01:53:09.158 --> 01:53:11.075
WE'RE NOT REALLY
TWO GUYS.

01:53:13.287 --> 01:53:15.371

01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:20.157

01:57:21.827 --> 01:57:23.160
VICTOR, DARLING,
DO YOU THINK

01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:25.788
YOU COULD POSSIBLY
MANAGE TO LOOK

01:57:25.998 --> 01:57:27.206
A LITTLE LESS...
FUNEREAL?

01:57:27.416 --> 01:57:28.666
RENE, DARLING?

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:29.875
YES?

01:57:30.043 --> 01:57:32.003
WHY DON'T YOU GO
SUCK AN EGG?

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.047
I DO WISH YOU'D
THINK ABOUT IT.

01:57:35.257 --> 01:57:36.632
I HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, TODDY.

01:57:36.842 --> 01:57:38.217
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS,
I'VE SPENT

01:57:38.427 --> 01:57:40.011
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME
THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:41.554
AND FOR
THE SEVEN HOURS

01:57:41.763 --> 01:57:43.639
I COULDN'T SLEEP
LAST NIGHT,

01:57:43.849 --> 01:57:45.683
I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY.

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.685
SO I'VE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.311
THAT IT'S JUST
NOT WORTH IT.

01:57:49.521 --> 01:57:51.230
I AM VERY UNHAPPY
IN THE EXTREME,

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.066

THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE.

01:57:54.276 --> 01:57:55.735

01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:32.146

01:58:32.355 --> 01:58:33.773

01:58:33.982 --> 01:58:35.232
WHAT'S WRONG,
MR. BERNSTEIN?

01:58:35.442 --> 01:58:36.776
KING'S PARTNER
SAL ANDRETTI

01:58:36.985 --> 01:58:39.737
SHOWED UP WITH A COUPLE
OF HIS TORPEDOES.

01:58:41.198 --> 01:58:43.074
SAL PUT UP THE MONEY
FOR THE CLUB,

01:58:43.283 --> 01:58:45.743
BUT, UH, THE MOB DOESN'T
CONSIDER HOMOSEXUALITY

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:47.119
AN ACCEPTABLE
LIFE STYLE.

01:58:47.329 --> 01:58:49.330

BUT MUSTN'T KISS HIM.

01:59:04.096 --> 01:59:05.179

01:59:30.497 --> 01:59:32.957
WHAT, DO YOU TAKE TURNS
BEING THE GIRL?

01:59:33.166 --> 01:59:35.835
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

01:59:36.044 --> 01:59:37.795
