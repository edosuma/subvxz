00:01.531 --> 00:04.611
You were lucky to have that
transgender person to help.

00:04.627 --> 00:06.907
Her name's Maxine.
Are you OK?

00:06.983 --> 00:09.783
Thanks for what you did. Bates's gear
is not all it's cracked up to be.

00:09.823 --> 00:13.643
There is a bad stash of gear coming
into the prison. It's called Pink Dragon.

00:13.713 --> 00:15.713
What do you want?
A hit.

00:15.753 --> 00:17.753
Junkies never change, do they?

00:17.793 --> 00:22.308
You talk about these women
being a family, then you pump
them full of crap gear.

00:22.308 --> 00:23.798
Aaaghh!

00:23.805 --> 00:26.805
How is this fair?
I'm the victim here.

00:27.102 --> 00:29.622
Who's that?
Vera's told me so much about you.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.862
Miss Ferguson
brought us some dinner.

00:31.902 --> 00:34.822
Damn sight better than
what you've been feeding me.

00:36.873 --> 00:38.573
You idiot.

00:38.619 --> 00:42.899
She'll be up for another seven years.
Is that how you look after your friends?

00:43.312 --> 00:45.312
Code black in H4.

00:45.592 --> 00:48.312
This is the same pink shit
I confiscated from H2.

00:48.353 --> 00:51.513
You obviously didn't find it all,
did you?

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.204 --> 02:06.204
They need to see this.

02:07.684 --> 02:10.804
I had a contract with these
prisoners and they broke it.

02:10.844 --> 02:14.164
You're punishing everyone
for the actions of one or two.

02:14.204 --> 02:16.204
Exactly.

02:21.204 --> 02:25.004
Look at them, Vera. It's the herd
mentality that drives those women.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.044
If we show an ounce of weakness...

02:28.684 --> 02:30.684
..the herd will sense it.

02:44.324 --> 02:47.844
I'm here as a peer worker, Franky,
to make sure you're all right.

02:48.724 --> 02:51.644
Fuck me.
I hope you're happy with yourself.

02:51.684 --> 02:53.684
Yeah, I'm pumped.

02:53.724 --> 02:55.724
Check it out.

02:56.724 --> 02:59.044
You hear what Ferguson did
to the garden?

02:59.084 --> 03:01.484
Took a Bobcat to it.
The shed, everything.

03:01.524 --> 03:03.924
It's all gone.
Nazi bitch.

03:03.964 --> 03:05.964
No, you're the bitch.

03:06.004 --> 03:08.004
You're responsible, Franky.

03:08.044 --> 03:10.804
Nash, the magpie.
You wrecked everything.

03:10.844 --> 03:13.044
Whoo! Not feeling loved up here,
Dors.

03:13.084 --> 03:15.084
You got to work on your peer shit.

03:15.124 --> 03:17.204
Fuck being a peer worker
and fuck you!

03:17.244 --> 03:20.964
You ruined everything for your own
selfish bloody purposes.

03:21.004 --> 03:23.844
Didn't hear you complain
when I got you time with loverboy.

03:23.884 --> 03:25.884
Everything OK, ladies?

03:27.364 --> 03:29.364
Sweet as pie, Mr J.

03:29.404 --> 03:31.404
Right, Dors?

03:31.444 --> 03:33.924
OK, then, Franky. Holiday's over.

03:42.204 --> 03:44.204
You'd love him, Bea.

03:44.244 --> 03:46.244
He's...

03:46.284 --> 03:48.644
Well, he's my saviour.

03:48.684 --> 03:51.484
This is the first time
he's visited though, yeah?

03:51.524 --> 03:54.684
He's busy. With work.
He travels a lot.

03:54.724 --> 03:57.724
I really wish you could meet him.
He'd like you.

03:57.764 --> 04:00.444
You never told me what happened
between you two.

04:01.924 --> 04:03.924
Nice do, Maxie.

04:03.964 --> 04:05.964
Word?

04:15.924 --> 04:18.404
I'm sorry about Simmo.
No, you're not.

04:18.444 --> 04:20.444
It was a shitty way to go.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.764
It was your crap gear that did it.
She did it to herself.

04:23.804 --> 04:25.804
Just want to make sure we're sweet.

04:27.244 --> 04:29.244
I found her, Franky.

04:29.284 --> 04:31.284
Needle was still -
Oh -

04:31.324 --> 04:33.524
..pink crap still in it.
The pink crap?

04:33.564 --> 04:36.364
She hadn't finished the hit
before it killed her.

04:36.404 --> 04:38.404
You sure it was pink?

04:42.804 --> 04:45.284
Boob cosies.
You can have them when I leave.

04:45.324 --> 04:47.324
Cool!
Make a bikini.

04:47.364 --> 04:49.364
I'd look good in a bikini.

04:49.404 --> 04:51.404
You're back!

04:52.804 --> 04:54.804
Did you sell some Pink Dragon?

04:54.844 --> 04:57.284
What? No, I never.

04:57.324 --> 05:00.404
Look at my face.
That shit hadn't been cut yet.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.964
I did what you told me to do.
I hid it in my cell.

05:03.004 --> 05:05.004
You gave some to Simmo.
Franky.

05:05.044 --> 05:07.564
Or you sold it to someone
who gave it to Simmo.

05:07.604 --> 05:10.124
I didn't!
Franky! She's telling the truth.

05:10.164 --> 05:12.164
How the fuck would you know?

05:12.204 --> 05:14.404
I was here
when Fletch tossed the cell.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.444
He found the gear
and she hadn't opened it.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.484
So how did Simmo
get her hands on it?

05:18.524 --> 05:20.924
How do you know she did?
Cos I fucking know.

05:20.964 --> 05:22.964
Maybe Fletcher sold it to her.

05:23.004 --> 05:24.004
What?

05:24.044 --> 05:26.764
He's been a bit grumpier
than normal, hasn't he?

05:28.204 --> 05:30.404
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was bent.

05:35.684 --> 05:37.684
Jesus wept!

05:39.044 --> 05:41.044
You clean it.
Stuff that.

05:41.084 --> 05:43.564
One of these delicate flowers here
can do it.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.604
Here we go. Goldilocks.

05:45.644 --> 05:47.964
Got a job for you.
I've got a visitor.

05:48.004 --> 05:50.004
Not for 20 minutes.

05:50.044 --> 05:52.044
Plenty of time to mop up this spew.

05:52.084 --> 05:55.204
I don't want to smell of vomit.
I don't give a flying fig.

05:55.244 --> 05:58.124
You'll mop it up
or I'll write you up a charge.

05:58.164 --> 06:00.244
Fletch!
I've got a visitor.

06:00.284 --> 06:03.884
I'll can your visit
unless you mop this up now.

06:03.924 --> 06:06.644
I'll do it afterwards.
You'll take the fuck off!

06:06.684 --> 06:08.684
Fletch!
Jesus Christ.

06:10.084 --> 06:13.484
Is that all you got? Get off the
fucking floor and take the mop!

06:13.524 --> 06:15.524
I will take care of this!

06:15.564 --> 06:17.564
Just go away! Go!

06:19.604 --> 06:21.604
Pussies!

06:25.924 --> 06:27.924
Can I help?

06:29.764 --> 06:31.764
Do you mind if I...

06:31.804 --> 06:34.284
You're not very good
at putting on make-up.

06:35.924 --> 06:37.924
Thank you.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.964
It was self-defence.

06:40.004 --> 06:42.484
You stuck a garden fork
in a man's genitals.

06:42.524 --> 06:44.924
That's the bit I was defending
myself from.

06:44.964 --> 06:48.684
This is an act that suggests a
certain level of intentional malice.

06:48.724 --> 06:50.724
Good.

06:50.764 --> 06:56.404
You said he was going to rape you
in the garden shed. Is that right?

06:56.444 --> 06:58.444
The fucking penthouse was taken.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.484
Mr Bates says you came on to him.

07:00.524 --> 07:03.044
I don't eat sausage.
I'm a vagitarian.

07:04.804 --> 07:06.804
And what does that mean?

07:06.844 --> 07:07.844
Fuck.

07:22.444 --> 07:24.804
Hi, Maxie. How are you going? You OK?

07:24.844 --> 07:26.844
You look great.

07:26.884 --> 07:28.884
It's really good to see you.

07:28.924 --> 07:31.644
What's wrong? Why are you here?

07:31.684 --> 07:33.684
Has something happened to Gary?

07:33.724 --> 07:35.724
No. Sit.

07:37.884 --> 07:39.884
They won't let Gary visit.

07:39.924 --> 07:41.924
Why?

07:41.964 --> 07:43.964
Hey, sis! How are you?

07:46.764 --> 07:49.364
Good to see you!
It's good to see you.

07:49.404 --> 07:52.244
Look at you. You're looking good.

07:52.284 --> 07:54.924
I'm feeling good too.
Yeah?

07:54.964 --> 07:57.444
NA is keeping me on the straight
and narrow.

07:57.484 --> 08:00.324
I'm so happy for you.

08:02.564 --> 08:04.564
I freaked when you called.

08:04.604 --> 08:06.604
I mean, shit, Dor.

08:06.644 --> 08:08.644
Yeah.

08:09.884 --> 08:11.884
I need to see him.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.924
They haven't let me call him.

08:13.964 --> 08:17.444
I need to explain to him
why it happened the way it did.

08:18.684 --> 08:20.684
I need to tell him.

08:22.164 --> 08:24.164
I need to tell him I love him.

08:25.644 --> 08:28.444
I can do that for you.
No! I need to tell him myself!

08:34.203 --> 08:37.284
Gary... has been headhunted.

08:37.323 --> 08:41.244
He's got a big project
starting in New Zealand.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.284
He won't be back for months.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.324
Not until the trial.

08:45.364 --> 08:47.364
I need to see him before he goes.

08:47.404 --> 08:50.244
Hey, he never deserved you.

08:50.284 --> 08:52.284
Maxie, the way he treated you!

08:52.324 --> 08:55.244
You're too bloody good for that,
brother of mine.

08:57.444 --> 09:02.084
No reasonable person is going to believe
you were justified in castrating a man.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.124
They don't have to believe it.

09:04.164 --> 09:08.484
The only question to be asked
is whether the accused believed,
on reasonable grounds,

09:08.524 --> 09:12.044
whether it was necessary in
self-defence to do what he or she did.

09:12.084 --> 09:14.084
Zecevic versus DPP, 1987.

09:14.124 --> 09:17.884
Thanks so much for doing this.
I'm sorry about all the crap.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.924
No, you're all right.

09:19.964 --> 09:23.484
No. You were really good
to me and Kaiya.

09:34.844 --> 09:37.044
Not everyone sees things
the same way.

09:37.084 --> 09:39.084
Aren't you the smart one?

09:40.724 --> 09:43.044
You know what? You're sacked.

09:47.124 --> 09:49.324
You'll regret this.
I'm scared!

09:53.764 --> 09:55.764
Hair.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.804
Give it a shake.

09:57.844 --> 09:59.844
Mouth.

10:01.364 --> 10:03.364
Wide.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.204
Bend over.

10:08.284 --> 10:10.284
Part your cheeks.

10:13.844 --> 10:15.844
That's it.

10:15.884 --> 10:17.884
Put your T-shirt on.

10:27.364 --> 10:29.364
What's in there, Dors?

10:29.404 --> 10:31.404
Nothing.

10:31.444 --> 10:33.444
I'll stand here all day
if I have to.

10:36.364 --> 10:38.364
We go fishing?

10:38.404 --> 10:40.404
It's not drugs!
Oi, Booms!

10:40.444 --> 10:42.804
All right! All right!

10:42.844 --> 10:44.844
What?
Get us a cuppa, will you?

10:44.884 --> 10:47.404
Get it yourself.
Can you at least turn around?

10:47.444 --> 10:50.124
It's not like I haven't seen
your janie before.

10:58.444 --> 11:00.444
Well?

11:00.484 --> 11:02.524
OK. I'm late.

11:02.564 --> 11:04.564
And I've been crook.

11:04.604 --> 11:07.004
Ha! Didn't you use protection?

11:07.044 --> 11:09.044
Piss off.

11:09.084 --> 11:12.604
How late are you?
I don't know. That's why I got it.

11:12.644 --> 11:15.724
Better hope
the Grim Reaper doesn't find out.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.544
Your hesitation cost you.

11:37.593 --> 11:40.553
You have the instinct
and the desire.

11:40.593 --> 11:43.273
What you lack is the ability
to follow through.

11:43.313 --> 11:45.393
My opponent lost his balance.

11:45.433 --> 11:48.713
That made him vulnerable.
Why did you stop?

11:50.113 --> 11:52.153
It was a sporting thing to do.

11:52.193 --> 11:55.513
It was the weak thing to do.

11:57.113 --> 11:59.593
The time to strike
is when he is on his knees.

11:59.633 --> 12:03.913
A lesser opponent will rise up
if you give him the slightest opportunity.

12:03.953 --> 12:05.993
You must be ruthless.

12:17.856 --> 12:19.856
You wanted to see me, Governor.

12:25.487 --> 12:27.487
Yes, Vera.

12:27.527 --> 12:32.367
We need to get to the bottom
of this garden contraband racket.

12:32.407 --> 12:34.407
And to be honest...

12:36.286 --> 12:38.286
..I am stuck.

12:38.326 --> 12:41.126
Why don't you take charge
of that investigation?

12:41.166 --> 12:46.486
I'm giving you a full mandate to do
whatever it takes to pin Doyle for
it. We know she was behind it.

12:46.526 --> 12:49.126
It's important that we make
an example of her.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.486
Get someone to talk.
The women won't lag.

12:51.526 --> 12:53.726
Then you will find another way.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.726
Just bring me proof.

12:59.366 --> 13:01.366
Is there a problem?

13:01.406 --> 13:05.006
Time to step up, Vera. I'm giving
you a chance to prove yourself.

13:05.046 --> 13:09.246
Come on, help me. I believe in you.
You just need to believe in yourself.

13:09.286 --> 13:11.286
Thank you, Governor.

13:35.766 --> 13:38.446
Come on. Open up.

13:38.486 --> 13:40.486
Open up.

13:40.526 --> 13:42.526
Mum, I...

13:45.166 --> 13:47.166
I had a good day at work today.

13:47.206 --> 13:50.006
I think Joan is starting
to trust me more.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.046
Joan.

13:52.086 --> 13:54.086
The governor.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.126
Remember? She brought us tea.

13:57.886 --> 13:59.886
She lets me call her that.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.126
She's given me a very important job.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.126
You'll fail. You always do.

14:09.126 --> 14:11.126
Come on, you've got to eat.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.166
I'm in terrible pain!

14:13.206 --> 14:16.206
You're not due another
morphine shot till midnight.

14:17.846 --> 14:20.646
You've always been
a disappointment to me, Vera.

14:20.686 --> 14:24.326
Even as a little girl,
you never had much spirit.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.366
I think that was because you were...

14:33.126 --> 14:35.246
What was it they used to call you,
Vera?

14:35.286 --> 14:37.286
The kids at school.

14:37.326 --> 14:39.966
Huh?
Can't remember, Mum.

14:42.726 --> 14:45.526
Stinky Pants. Was that it?

14:46.846 --> 14:49.646
After you wet yourself
at show and tell.

14:49.686 --> 14:52.806
I could still hear them when
I'd pick you up from school.

14:52.846 --> 14:56.006
Here comes Vera Stinky Pants!

15:00.246 --> 15:02.246
Oh, Mum!

15:02.286 --> 15:05.006
Mum! Sit up. Try and sit up.

15:05.046 --> 15:07.886
Why are you putting me
through this, Vera?!

15:07.926 --> 15:11.166
Why?
I am trying to take care of you.

15:11.206 --> 15:13.206
No, you're not! Stop the pain!

15:13.246 --> 15:15.766
I can't!
For God's sake, stop the...

15:15.806 --> 15:17.806
I don't know what to do, Mum!

15:17.846 --> 15:19.846
Do something!

15:51.766 --> 15:54.766
How's Goldilocks?
What is your problem with Maxine?

15:54.806 --> 15:58.286
I don't have a problem with him,
as long as he does as he's told.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.446
The doors have been closed
all morning.

16:29.726 --> 16:32.206
Heads up, the women
don't really like that.

16:35.606 --> 16:37.606
You want to talk about it?

16:39.126 --> 16:42.126
I'm going to be here
for the next... 12 years.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.166
So if you change your mind...

16:53.449 --> 16:56.169
Hey, might want to give that one
another wash.

16:56.399 --> 16:58.399
OK, that's lunch.

16:58.439 --> 17:00.719
Right on cue. You all right?

17:00.759 --> 17:03.279
Come on. Come on, Dor.

17:06.587 --> 17:08.587
Not you, Doyle.

17:13.186 --> 17:16.587
We both know you were behind
the drop-box in the garden shed.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.867
How's your mum, Miss Bennett?

17:19.906 --> 17:22.387
Boomer's looking at serious
drug charges.

17:22.426 --> 17:24.426
She's in a bad way.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.987
You're really going to let her
take the fall?

17:30.027 --> 17:32.307
Boomer's a scapegoat.
Your scapegoat.

17:32.347 --> 17:34.947
It wasn't me. It wasn't Booms.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.387
If you ask me,
it was one of the officers.

17:37.427 --> 17:39.547
Is that the best that you've got?!

17:39.587 --> 17:43.667
It's pretty good. That guard Steve,
he was smuggling shit in.

17:43.707 --> 17:46.227
Leaving it in the shed
for one of his mates to pick up.

17:46.267 --> 17:48.547
The contraband was found
in Boomer's cell.

17:48.587 --> 17:50.787
It was planted there
once the shit hit the fan.

17:50.827 --> 17:54.027
That's not going to wash.
The officer found it in no time.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.947
Practically went straight
to where it was stashed.

17:56.987 --> 17:58.987
Like he knew it was there.

18:00.387 --> 18:02.387
You see Mr Fletcher lately?

18:04.187 --> 18:06.187
Does he look like he's been using?

18:08.147 --> 18:11.547
Hm! You're no different to us.

18:11.587 --> 18:13.667
You just wear a fancy uniform.

18:13.707 --> 18:15.707
Go to lunch.

18:18.507 --> 18:20.787
I am sorry about your mum,
Miss Bennett.

19:09.947 --> 19:11.947
He cut my hair off, Bea.

19:11.987 --> 19:13.987
Gary?

19:14.027 --> 19:16.027
He paid for the surgery.

19:16.067 --> 19:19.747
He told me if that's what I wanted,
he'd support me 100%.

19:23.267 --> 19:28.067
My shrink warned me
Gary was more interested in me
as a cross-dressing gay man.

19:31.107 --> 19:33.107
I said I'm not gay.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.667
I'm a woman.

19:36.707 --> 19:38.707
And I always have been.

19:38.747 --> 19:43.267
Bea, I had this fantasy I was going to
emerge from the chrysalis like a butterfly.

19:44.547 --> 19:47.467
Turns out Gary preferred
his butterfly with a cock.

19:49.107 --> 19:51.107
One night, I woke up and...

19:54.587 --> 19:57.187
He was hacking my hair off
with some scissors.

19:58.387 --> 20:00.387
Before I knew it...

20:01.707 --> 20:03.707
I grabbed them and I...

20:03.747 --> 20:05.747
I stabbed him.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.987
My hair, I had to shave it off.

20:12.747 --> 20:14.747
That's why I wear this wig.

20:16.747 --> 20:20.827
If I could just see him for five
minutes. That's all I need
to make him understand.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.867
You -
Aaaaghh!

20:22.907 --> 20:24.907
My veins!

20:27.027 --> 20:29.027
It's my veins!

20:29.067 --> 20:31.347
Medical assistance
to the dining room!

20:31.387 --> 20:33.387
Aagh!

20:33.427 --> 20:35.427
We've got this.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.467
Let me look.

20:38.827 --> 20:41.427
Call Medical.
I'm bringing down Marge Novak.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.467
Marge, listen to me. Marge!

20:43.507 --> 20:45.507
Are you hep C positive?

20:46.627 --> 20:49.427
OK. You need to come down with me
and get cleaned up.

20:49.467 --> 20:51.467
Well done, Max.

20:51.507 --> 20:53.507
Don't let her bleed on the food!

20:53.547 --> 20:55.547
It's going to be all right.

20:59.401 --> 21:01.881
Here you go. That will do
until you get to the staff room.

21:01.926 --> 21:03.926
Thanks.
You're welcome.

21:07.774 --> 21:10.174
Any cuts on your hands?
Let me look.

21:18.150 --> 21:20.150
Rose.
Yeah?

21:20.190 --> 21:22.510
Where do I put
the contaminated clothes?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.829
Dump them in the basket. I'll put
them through the laundry.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.870
How's Novak?
Her varicose veins.

21:27.910 --> 21:29.910
She's also a haemophiliac.

21:33.430 --> 21:35.430
It's a bit on the small side.

21:35.470 --> 21:37.470
Looks good.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.550
Er... OK, your turn.

21:41.590 --> 21:44.710
Pop these on for me.
Throw your clothes in the basket.

21:44.750 --> 21:46.750
Thanks very much.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.390
Any cuts on your hands?

21:51.430 --> 21:53.430
Let me look. Yeah.

21:53.470 --> 21:56.270
Sorry, this is a little too small
for you.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.310
So you lied to me.

22:24.070 --> 22:26.070
It's Maxine.

22:28.230 --> 22:30.230
I really need to see you again.

22:32.550 --> 22:36.350
I've called in the SCSG to conduct
a formal search of all prison officers -

22:36.390 --> 22:40.070
A search of the officers? I asked
you about the garden shed drop-box.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.190
That's what I'm doing.
To get Franky Doyle.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.350
There's another line
of investigation.

22:44.390 --> 22:46.390
Not colleagues.
I do understand that.

22:46.430 --> 22:49.710
A security search reflects
poorly on my staff. Especially on me.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.750
It is not my intention
to embarrass you.

22:51.790 --> 22:53.790
Then explain
why you ignored my order.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.830
I'm doing exactly what you ordered.

22:59.590 --> 23:04.270
I have reason to suspect
Mr Fletcher of smuggling in
the contraband from Walford.

23:21.110 --> 23:23.110
What's going on?

23:23.150 --> 23:25.150
What are you doing in my locker?

23:25.190 --> 23:28.790
Miss Bennett has brought in the SCSG
to conduct a search of staff.

23:32.910 --> 23:34.910
They're amino acids.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.710
In daily portions.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.750
Miss Bennett?

23:56.950 --> 24:01.270
Mr Fletcher, the SCSG are going to
test that material for illicit substances.

24:01.310 --> 24:02.310
What?

24:02.350 --> 24:05.270
I ask you to leave the premises
until the matter is resolved.

24:05.310 --> 24:08.710
They're bloody amino acids!
You need to leave, Mr Fletcher.

24:16.630 --> 24:18.630
Dor?
Yeah?

24:18.670 --> 24:22.190
I missed you at lunch.
You must be crook.

24:22.230 --> 24:26.190
Heard about you spewing.
A gift for C block.

24:26.230 --> 24:28.430
We brought you some dry biscuits.
Oh...

24:29.430 --> 24:31.950
If you're crook,
why don't you see the nurse?

24:31.990 --> 24:33.990
I don't need to.

24:36.230 --> 24:38.470
Oh, my God, you're preggers!

24:38.510 --> 24:41.630
Dor!
Sneaky little bugger!

24:41.670 --> 24:44.030
With Nash, eh?
Yeah.

24:44.070 --> 24:46.630
Ssshh.
Are you OK with it?

24:46.670 --> 24:49.310
I want a baby more than anything.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.750
But I just don't want
to bring it up in here.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.390
Oh, Kaiya was all right, wasn't she?

24:54.430 --> 24:56.950
Did you tell anyone?
Franky.

24:56.990 --> 25:00.670
She made me tell. But keep it
a secret. We can't tell anyone.

25:00.710 --> 25:03.870
Dor, we can't keep it a secret.
You are going to get huge.

25:03.910 --> 25:06.670
Just for a couple of months.
Till Nash gets out.

25:06.710 --> 25:09.470
I don't want this to stuff up
his parole.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.510
Oh, love.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.550
Oh, my Dor!

25:15.230 --> 25:17.230
There you go, Mum.

25:18.430 --> 25:20.430
OK, that's it.

25:22.030 --> 25:25.150
Not enough.
It's the maximum dose.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.270
Any more is dangerous.
Pain!

25:27.310 --> 25:29.310
Give it a minute.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.950
Ohhh!

25:49.750 --> 25:51.750
Vera!

25:52.670 --> 25:54.670
Vera! The pain!

25:56.430 --> 25:58.430
Vera!

26:11.430 --> 26:13.430
Shut up.
Vera!

26:14.950 --> 26:16.950
Shut up. Shut up.

26:16.990 --> 26:18.990
Shut up.

26:19.030 --> 26:21.030
Shut up! Shut up!

26:21.070 --> 26:23.470
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

26:52.310 --> 26:54.310
It's Governor Ferguson.

26:54.350 --> 26:56.350
Governor. Yes?

26:56.390 --> 26:59.990
The lab results came back on the
package in Mr Fletcher's locker.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.030
Right.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.150
It's a common amino acid supplement.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.710
Biologically dubious
but perfectly legal.

27:08.430 --> 27:10.430
I am extremely disappointed, Vera.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.830
You have really let me down.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.870
I'm sorry.

27:15.910 --> 27:17.910
Yes.

27:19.310 --> 27:22.110
I'm not the only one
you should be apologising to.

27:22.150 --> 27:24.150
We'll speak tomorrow.

27:35.590 --> 27:37.590
I am so sorry.

27:37.630 --> 27:39.630
I don't know what I was thinking.

27:39.670 --> 27:44.270
Franky Doyle planted a seed about you
smuggling in the contraband from Walford.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.310
Matt.

27:46.350 --> 27:49.270
Vera? Not your mum, is it?

27:52.110 --> 27:54.110
Sorry.

27:58.278 --> 28:00.350
What was that about?
I don't care.

28:14.155 --> 28:16.155
Sorry, Marge.

28:17.956 --> 28:19.956
Are you feeling all right?

28:19.995 --> 28:21.995
It's my veins.

28:22.036 --> 28:25.916
Bloody hell, they go
and then they bleed and bleed.

28:25.956 --> 28:27.956
I die every time.

28:27.996 --> 28:29.996
They gave me a little pill.

28:31.996 --> 28:34.076
It's a miracle pill!

28:35.236 --> 28:37.236
It stops the blood.

28:37.276 --> 28:39.276
Makes it thicker.

28:39.316 --> 28:41.916
I tell you, it's a miracle drug.

28:43.292 --> 28:45.292
I die every time.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.332
But...

28:48.452 --> 28:50.452
What did you say?

28:50.492 --> 28:52.692
Haemo. Haemophiliac.
Yes, I know that.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.732
But what did you say before?

28:54.772 --> 28:56.772
They upped my dose.

28:56.812 --> 28:58.812
Might have bled to death, eh?

28:58.852 --> 29:00.852
So the drugs stop the bleeding.

29:00.892 --> 29:02.892
Yeah, yeah, stopped it.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.452
Bloody miracle.

29:27.812 --> 29:29.812
What are you after?

29:33.452 --> 29:35.452
I hope you feel better soon, Marge.

29:42.492 --> 29:44.572
The governor called me this morning.

29:44.612 --> 29:46.612
My suspension has been lifted.

29:46.652 --> 29:49.612
About last night. Are we OK?

29:51.052 --> 29:53.052
Sure.

30:05.892 --> 30:07.892
Fletch.

30:22.292 --> 30:24.292
Hey, I'm taking a... What?!

30:24.332 --> 30:26.332
Get the fuck out, mate!

30:26.372 --> 30:28.692
You think
you're pretty fucking clever.

30:28.732 --> 30:30.732
Can you open my door, please?
Why?

30:30.772 --> 30:33.852
Fearing for your personal safety?
I've got a fucking reputation.

30:33.892 --> 30:37.212
I don't give a fuck about your
reputation since you crapped all over mine.

30:37.252 --> 30:40.572
I don't know what you're talking -
Talk or I'll choke you out!

30:40.612 --> 30:42.612
You're a bent screw.
Bullshit.

30:42.652 --> 30:45.252
You sold that gear to Simmo.
You know fuck all.

30:45.292 --> 30:48.292
You idiot! I'm going to make
your pathetic life hell.

30:48.332 --> 30:51.052
It's already hell.
It's a fucking holiday camp.

30:51.092 --> 30:53.972
You must have been to some
fucked-up camps as a kid.

30:54.012 --> 30:56.012
Yap, yap, yap.

30:56.052 --> 30:58.052
Hey, what's going on in here?

30:59.972 --> 31:01.972
What is going on?

31:06.092 --> 31:08.092
Are you all right?
Yeah.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.132
What was that about?
Nothing.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.172
Fucking Fletch.

31:15.692 --> 31:17.692
I'm going to get that prick.

31:30.012 --> 31:32.012
You've got to eat something.
No!

31:48.452 --> 31:50.452
Oi. Fletch is coming.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.132
In there.

32:16.332 --> 32:18.332
What's going on?

32:22.172 --> 32:24.172
Panic alarm in the kitchen.

32:24.212 --> 32:26.212
Panic alarm in the kitchen.

32:27.252 --> 32:29.252
Copy that. I'm on my way.

33:06.732 --> 33:08.732
Aagh!

33:21.452 --> 33:24.092
Check it out!
She's got vinegar tits!

33:47.012 --> 33:49.012
Vinegar tits!

33:51.332 --> 33:53.332
Vinegar tits!

33:55.452 --> 33:57.452
Did you see them?!

33:58.652 --> 34:00.652
Vinegar tits!

34:00.692 --> 34:02.692
Relax!

34:20.092 --> 34:22.092
Stinky Pants.

34:22.132 --> 34:24.132
Stinky Pants. Stinky Pants.

34:24.172 --> 34:26.172
Stinky Pants.

34:26.212 --> 34:28.212
Stinky Pants. Stinky Pants.

34:29.572 --> 34:31.572
Vera!

34:34.331 --> 34:36.331
What's that smell?

34:38.891 --> 34:40.891
Vinegar.

34:40.931 --> 34:42.931
Oh, Vera.

34:44.972 --> 34:46.972
Vera, Vera, Vera.

34:48.732 --> 34:51.772
The prisoners -
No point looking to the prisoners.

34:51.812 --> 34:53.812
What do you expect from them?

34:53.851 --> 34:55.891
They smell weakness. They attack.

34:55.931 --> 34:57.932
It's as instinctive as breathing.

34:59.092 --> 35:02.412
It might be best
if you took some time off.

35:05.132 --> 35:07.132
You're too distracted.

35:07.172 --> 35:10.092
Your mother's illness,
it's taking all your focus.

35:10.132 --> 35:12.652
Ms Miles can assume
your responsibilities.

35:12.692 --> 35:14.692
I guess I was wrong about you.

35:16.612 --> 35:18.612
You're just not up to it, are you?

35:20.532 --> 35:22.532
Go home, Vera.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.492
Take care of your mother.

35:40.332 --> 35:44.612
I'm fixing up my place.
The water is back on now.

35:44.652 --> 35:46.652
The fishing's pretty good.

35:46.692 --> 35:49.932
A few trout. Carp.

35:49.972 --> 35:51.972
It sounds nice.

36:01.012 --> 36:04.532
White Wolf. I'll take you up there
if you like.

36:04.572 --> 36:06.732
I could teach you how to fly-fish.

36:16.092 --> 36:18.092
Are you OK, Vera?

36:18.132 --> 36:20.132
Fuck off.

36:26.932 --> 36:29.332
That drink machine
stole two bucks off me.

36:29.372 --> 36:33.332
I put it in and I pressed
the button and nothing came out.

36:48.892 --> 36:50.892
Visiting is now over.

36:54.932 --> 36:56.932
Thank you. Oi.

36:56.972 --> 36:58.972
Where's your pass?
Um...

36:59.012 --> 37:01.012
It's here somewhere.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.132
You're holding everyone up.
Sorry.

37:03.172 --> 37:05.172
Move over here. Find it.

37:12.172 --> 37:14.172
Sorry.

37:47.812 --> 37:49.812
Maxine?

37:54.252 --> 37:56.252
Maxine!

38:10.332 --> 38:12.892
Will! Will, it's Conway!

38:14.132 --> 38:16.132
It's Conway! Stop her!

38:16.172 --> 38:18.572
It's Conway! Stop her! It's Conway!

38:31.812 --> 38:33.972
Let me go! Let me go!

38:34.012 --> 38:36.012
Please!

38:49.084 --> 38:51.084
Miss Bennett.

38:54.724 --> 38:56.964
Can I have my wig back?
No.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.462
Please.

38:59.544 --> 39:02.195
If you want it your wig, then
you shouldn't have thrown it away.

39:24.644 --> 39:26.644
Didn't see you at lunch.

39:26.684 --> 39:28.684
Wasn't hungry.

39:28.724 --> 39:30.724
Not preggers, are you?

39:32.324 --> 39:34.324
Thinking about becoming a doctor?

39:34.364 --> 39:37.164
Why not? You're thinking about
becoming a lawyer.

39:37.204 --> 39:39.204
Good luck with that.

39:41.764 --> 39:43.924
Miss Miles, it's nice
to see you back.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.444
No thanks to you.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.684
You must have kissed
somebody's arse.

39:47.724 --> 39:49.724
No prizes for guessing whose.

39:51.564 --> 39:53.564
What do you want?
Bit of dirt.

39:53.604 --> 39:55.804
Plenty of that in the garden,
for free.

39:57.684 --> 39:59.684
Usual arrangement?
Mm-hm.

39:59.724 --> 40:02.004
Who do you want the dirt on?
Fletcher.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.804
He's as clean as they come.
Bullshit.

40:05.844 --> 40:07.844
The gear he found, he scored some.

40:07.884 --> 40:09.884
Says who?
Says me.

40:09.924 --> 40:11.924
Didn't happen.
How do you know?

40:11.964 --> 40:14.764
I saw what he found right after
he tossed the cell.

40:14.804 --> 40:17.204
He got it after that.
Didn't have a chance.

40:17.244 --> 40:19.764
He handed the whole package
to the Governor.

40:19.804 --> 40:21.804
To Ferguson?

40:21.844 --> 40:23.844
No fucking way!

40:23.884 --> 40:28.804
That's what I saw, Franky. Make
sure the money's in by Friday.
Want to make a night of it.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.084
Yes.
Governor, Franky Doyle.

40:45.604 --> 40:47.684
Thank you, Mr Jackson.
Thanks, Mr J.

40:47.724 --> 40:52.364
If this is about the lawyer you've
dismissed, you've burnt that bridge.

40:52.404 --> 40:55.324
Good. I'd rather rep myself.

40:55.364 --> 40:58.284
Because you're so much smarter
than everyone else?

40:58.324 --> 41:01.524
I hope you don't overestimate
your knowledge of the law.

41:03.204 --> 41:05.204
I don't claim to be an expert.

41:05.244 --> 41:08.404
But I do know an indictable offence
when I see one.

41:10.164 --> 41:12.164
Take Simmo's death, for instance.

41:14.084 --> 41:17.364
No, you've lost me. How is suicide
an indictable offence?

41:17.404 --> 41:22.924
Trafficking a drug of dependence.
15 years for a commercial quantity.

41:22.964 --> 41:26.244
No doubt that knowledge
will come in handy for you one day.

41:27.484 --> 41:29.484
Why did you want to see me?

41:31.524 --> 41:33.524
I know who sold Simmo the gear.

41:33.564 --> 41:35.564
Who?
You.

41:37.804 --> 41:39.804
How do you know that?

41:39.844 --> 41:41.844
Prima facie evidence.

41:41.884 --> 41:46.004
The gear that you had possession of
ended up in Simmo's veins.

41:46.044 --> 41:48.044
And you can prove this.
Maybe.

41:49.684 --> 41:55.604
Or... Maybe you could return
the gear to its rightful owner.

41:57.484 --> 41:59.484
I can forget it.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.404
You're very sure of yourself.

42:14.924 --> 42:16.924
I like that.

42:16.964 --> 42:18.964
But you have a tendency

42:19.004 --> 42:21.884
to overplay your hand.

42:23.444 --> 42:25.444
Could always ring the ombudsman.

42:25.484 --> 42:27.484
Make a shitload of noise.

42:40.164 --> 42:42.164
Are we done?

42:43.204 --> 42:45.204
I think we are done.

42:47.204 --> 42:49.204
How do you know it was suicide?

42:50.124 --> 42:52.124
You said it was suicide.

42:52.164 --> 42:54.524
Maybe it was an accidental OD.

42:54.564 --> 42:56.564
Slater had a history of drug abuse.

42:56.604 --> 42:59.124
I'm sure she knew exactly
what she was doing.

42:59.164 --> 43:01.844
Then why wasn't there any blood
in the syringe?

43:01.884 --> 43:05.764
She should have drawn blood into the
syringe to make sure it was in her vein.

43:05.804 --> 43:07.804
How do you know she didn't?

43:07.844 --> 43:10.764
Because the gear left in the needle
was pink, not red.

43:12.164 --> 43:14.164
So she didn't inject herself.

43:19.004 --> 43:21.004
Someone gave her a hot shot.

43:33.284 --> 43:36.604
If you really want to play detective,
Doyle,

43:36.644 --> 43:39.484
I have a far more interesting
mystery for you.

43:42.604 --> 43:46.084
How do you think we knew exactly
where the drugs were stashed?

43:46.124 --> 43:49.884
You should be less concerned
with how Simmo expired

43:49.924 --> 43:52.204
and more worried
about the fact that...

43:53.844 --> 43:55.924
..you have an informer in your ranks.
