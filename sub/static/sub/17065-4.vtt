WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:07.035
Well, I've officially quit
shopping for clothes in Westport.

00:07.104 --> 00:08.537
No one stocks my size.

00:08.605 --> 00:11.506
The only shirt that buttoned up
was a men's extra large,

00:11.575 --> 00:13.095
and I'm pretty sure it's a pajama top.

00:13.143 --> 00:17.412
So now I buy all my clothes
online from a store in Kansas,

00:17.481 --> 00:19.648
because in Kansas...

00:19.717 --> 00:20.649
I'm a medium.

00:20.718 --> 00:22.651
Ah, Kansas. Wonderful state.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.786
Their official bird is a western
meadowlark, I believe.

00:24.855 --> 00:27.889
Fun fact, babe...
You just killed my shirt buzz.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.157
So you working today?

00:29.226 --> 00:31.126
I'm writing an article
I am so excited about.

00:31.195 --> 00:32.259
I don't want to jinx anything,

00:32.329 --> 00:34.930
but I'm 100% sure
this will get me tenure.

00:34.998 --> 00:36.098
100% guaranteed.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.533
That is so exciting!
What's the article about?

00:38.602 --> 00:40.268
The title of the article is...

00:40.337 --> 00:43.038
"John Stuart Mill: Victorian Liberalism

00:43.107 --> 00:45.097
and the Fallacy of the Harm Principle."

00:45.209 --> 00:46.642
Sometimes when you say things,

00:46.710 --> 00:48.677
I just pretend
that your hair catches on fire.

00:48.746 --> 00:51.580
Make fun if you must,
but history is huge right now.

00:51.649 --> 00:53.081
JSM could be the new "Hamilton."

00:53.150 --> 00:55.083
♪ I'm Johnny Mills, I'm here to say ♪

00:55.152 --> 00:57.085
♪ Victorian era liberalism
is the only way ♪

01:00.357 --> 01:01.857
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

01:03.427 --> 01:05.894
Begin the ritual.

01:05.963 --> 01:08.397
<i>Before Greg can write,
he has to do this ritual.</i>

01:08.465 --> 01:10.332
<i>If we were rich, it'd be eccentric.</i>

01:10.401 --> 01:13.068
<i>We're not, so it's just weird.</i>

01:13.137 --> 01:15.447
<i>First he poses like
Wonder Woman for two minutes</i>

01:15.517 --> 01:16.638
<i>to raise his testosterone,</i>

01:16.707 --> 01:19.675
<i>then he listens to jazz
to activate his right brain.</i>

01:21.045 --> 01:25.013
<i>Next he eats six almonds for energy.</i>

01:25.082 --> 01:29.918
<i>And finally, he has
a glass of port to loosen up.</i>

01:37.261 --> 01:38.927
Now you're in the prose zone.

01:38.996 --> 01:41.196
<i>Sometimes I worry
Greg's too good for me,</i>

01:41.265 --> 01:43.632
<i>then I remember moments like this.</i>

01:48.906 --> 01:51.707
Oh, Katie!

01:51.775 --> 01:53.375
The hair, the rack, the shirt...

01:53.444 --> 01:55.377
I don't know which to compliment first.

01:55.446 --> 01:56.745
- The rack.
- Yes.

01:56.814 --> 01:57.979
Thank you.

01:58.048 --> 01:59.915
I'm feeling really good
about my purchase,

01:59.983 --> 02:01.850
but I still have
some residual Westport hate.

02:01.919 --> 02:04.019
I can sue those shops on Main Street

02:04.088 --> 02:05.220
for discrimination, right?

02:05.289 --> 02:06.521
Fat lives matter and whatnot?

02:06.590 --> 02:09.257
Okay, labeling tiny clothes
as large is evil,

02:09.326 --> 02:12.027
- but it isn't grounds for a lawsuit.
- Doris, what do you think?

02:12.096 --> 02:14.096
- Uh-huh. Sue all the lesbians.
- What?

02:14.164 --> 02:17.432
Katie, do you have any plans
for this expired turkey?

02:17.501 --> 02:20.435
Doris, you are rich.
You can afford new food.

02:20.504 --> 02:21.570
Yeah, but I hate waste.

02:21.638 --> 02:23.004
This is sealed,

02:23.073 --> 02:25.040
and sealed meat is good
for 11 years, like a Twinkie.

02:25.109 --> 02:26.708
You know what I love about you?

02:26.777 --> 02:28.577
You say nonsense with such authority.

02:28.645 --> 02:30.579
Good morning, ladies.

02:30.647 --> 02:31.446
Hey.

02:31.515 --> 02:33.415
Are you drinking scotch?

02:33.484 --> 02:36.384
Beside the fact that you're 12,
it's not even noon yet.

02:36.453 --> 02:37.619
It's just iced tea.

02:37.688 --> 02:38.854
I'm practicing my power swirl

02:38.922 --> 02:40.322
for when I'm a trader at Goldman.

02:40.390 --> 02:42.057
Of course.

02:44.561 --> 02:48.029
Maybe you're confused
on how a dishwasher works,

02:48.098 --> 02:49.965
because I get it. It's tricky.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.400
Step one... put the dishes
in the dishwasher.

02:52.469 --> 02:53.702
End of steps.

02:53.771 --> 02:55.137
Mom, I'll get around to it, all right?

02:55.162 --> 02:55.921
Unh-unh.

02:55.946 --> 02:58.907
When your mother tells you to do
something, you do it immediately.

02:58.976 --> 03:00.675
Ooh, if I was your mom...

03:00.744 --> 03:02.611
But you're not, though, okay?

03:02.679 --> 03:05.947
<i>Ah, the look. Every mom gets it.</i>

03:06.016 --> 03:07.315
<i>Doris is imagining</i>

03:07.384 --> 03:09.217
<i>choking Oliver to death
with her bare hands.</i>

03:09.286 --> 03:12.244
<i>Now she's remembering jail is a thing,</i>

03:12.354 --> 03:13.822
<i>so she shoves the rage down</i>

03:13.891 --> 03:16.558
<i>and saves it for when someone
thinks she's Japanese.</i>

03:16.627 --> 03:18.894
Let's just avoid any bloodshed.

03:18.962 --> 03:20.922
Hey, who put all these juices
in your meat drawer?

03:20.964 --> 03:21.797
I did.

03:21.865 --> 03:23.098
At soccer practice,

03:23.167 --> 03:25.233
Emily said she had
the best juice the other day.

03:25.302 --> 03:27.435
Em's the goalie, and her stories
are always super funny.

03:27.504 --> 03:29.838
So then Ashley...
Ash is the equipment manager...

03:29.907 --> 03:31.106
and she's awesome.

03:31.175 --> 03:32.711
Her clothes are so cool,
and her hair is like...

03:32.797 --> 03:34.553
You tell stories just like your dad.

03:34.578 --> 03:35.744
Get to the point.

03:35.813 --> 03:37.461
The soccer team is doing
a juice fast together.

03:37.571 --> 03:38.747
A juice what?!

03:38.816 --> 03:40.599
A juice fast is when
you don't eat for a couple...

03:40.677 --> 03:42.184
I know what a juice fast is.

03:42.252 --> 03:44.920
Put down the juice and pick up
an ice-cream sandwich now!

03:44.988 --> 03:46.521
Mom, you can't make me eat dessert.

03:46.590 --> 03:50.025
Keep this up and I will make you eat
a sleeve of Oreos for breakfast.

03:50.093 --> 03:51.459
That's legal! I've checked.

03:53.764 --> 03:55.497
Today's my art show!

03:55.566 --> 03:58.099
Sweetie, I'm excited for you,
but Daddy is working,

03:58.168 --> 03:59.334
and Daddy has this ritual,

03:59.403 --> 04:00.969
and whenever somebody interrupts it,

04:01.038 --> 04:03.104
well, then he just has to
start it all over again.

04:03.173 --> 04:05.207
I had my art teacher e-mail you
my drawing,

04:05.275 --> 04:07.175
so print it out.

04:07.244 --> 04:11.346
Okay, well, Daddy has to write
to get this thing called tenure.

04:11.415 --> 04:14.783
The saying goes,
"It's publish or perish."

04:14.852 --> 04:16.952
Perish is the word
in all my Titanic books.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.452
It means die.

04:18.522 --> 04:19.688
Are you gonna die?

04:19.755 --> 04:20.789
Never.

04:20.858 --> 04:23.158
Well, eventually,
but not for a long time.

04:23.227 --> 04:24.292
Am I gonna die?

04:25.829 --> 04:26.962
Let's just print it out.

04:27.030 --> 04:28.163
- Yay!
- Yeah.

04:28.232 --> 04:30.599
My assignment
was to draw a family portrait,

04:30.667 --> 04:34.636
and tonight it'll be on display
for everyone to see.

04:37.507 --> 04:39.107
Is that the way you drew Mommy?

04:39.176 --> 04:40.108
Mm-hmm.

04:40.177 --> 04:41.309
Um...

04:41.378 --> 04:42.878
It's just a juice fast.

04:42.946 --> 04:44.479
It's not like we made a pregnancy pact

04:44.548 --> 04:45.988
like the basketball team in Norwalk.

04:46.049 --> 04:47.195
- Whoa.
- First of all,

04:47.289 --> 04:48.684
you are never going to Norwalk again,

04:48.685 --> 04:51.253
and, yes, this juice fast
is a huge deal!

04:51.321 --> 04:54.022
When I was your age,
I wasn't juice-fasting.

04:54.091 --> 04:55.991
I was protesting Prince's name change

04:56.059 --> 04:57.592
- and smoking clove cigarettes.
- Yeah.

04:57.661 --> 04:59.794
Don't smoke. That's a horrible example.

04:59.819 --> 05:00.906
Katie, can I talk to you for a sec?

05:00.931 --> 05:02.999
Not now, Greg.
I'm about to say something important,

05:03.085 --> 05:05.100
and I'm glad that both
of my daughters can listen.

05:05.168 --> 05:10.205
Taylor, Anna-Kat,
look at Doris, Angela, and I.

05:10.274 --> 05:13.608
Notice we all have
very different body types.

05:13.677 --> 05:15.877
And all women's bodies are beautiful.

05:15.946 --> 05:18.123
Yes, we get it. You love the lady flesh.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.989
- Doris, children.
- Oh, please, they know.

05:20.091 --> 05:22.617
You do not need to do anything
to be beautiful except this.

05:22.686 --> 05:24.519
Be proud of your own body

05:24.588 --> 05:27.222
and never, ever care
what anybody else thinks.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.057
Don't give in
to the vanity of this town,

05:29.126 --> 05:31.593
and you, my lovely daughters,

05:31.662 --> 05:35.497
will always be perfect.

05:40.437 --> 05:41.903
I crushed that.

05:41.972 --> 05:43.492
I was like Winston Churchill in there.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.540
Better than Churchill.

05:44.574 --> 05:45.674
I'm better than Churchill.

05:45.742 --> 05:47.008
It was an excellent speech.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.715
Now, I want you to remember that
and don't overreact

05:49.817 --> 05:52.106
when you see Anna-Kat's drawing
for her art show.

05:53.684 --> 05:56.418
Oh, my God. Look at me.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.921
Remember, the crayon adds 10 pounds.

06:05.144 --> 06:06.893
"Because of his friendship
with Auguste Comte,

06:06.918 --> 06:09.130
John Stuart Mill's effect on positivism

06:09.225 --> 06:10.724
cannot be understated."

06:10.987 --> 06:12.614
I am on fire.

06:12.756 --> 06:15.190
My oldest daughter is juice-fasting,

06:15.258 --> 06:17.559
probably because she's afraid
she's going to be fat like me.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.867
- Meanwhile, my favorite child...
- Can't rank them like that.

06:19.896 --> 06:21.830
...draws me
like a beach ball with gloves.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.331
Is this how Anna-Kat sees me?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.465
It's really not that bad.

06:24.534 --> 06:25.600
Says the guy with broad shoulders

06:25.669 --> 06:26.801
and a full head of hair.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.303
Well, I've been taking the stairs more

06:28.371 --> 06:29.604
and experimenting with mousse.

06:29.673 --> 06:30.805
Maybe that's what she's picking up on?

06:30.874 --> 06:32.207
It's a drawing of a 7-year-old.

06:32.275 --> 06:33.641
You can't take it that seriously.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.477
I am not the problem.
The Westport mommies are.

06:36.546 --> 06:38.179
Tonight they're gonna whisper
about me and laugh

06:38.248 --> 06:39.814
and walk by me
and they'll be nothing but like,

06:39.883 --> 06:41.249
"Hi, Katie!"

06:41.318 --> 06:43.451
And their stupid fake smiles.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.186
I'm not sure I can handle it.

06:45.255 --> 06:46.387
But you just told our daughters

06:46.456 --> 06:47.655
not to care what other people say...

06:47.724 --> 06:49.357
I remember the speech, Greg!

06:49.426 --> 06:50.986
Why don't you go down to the art center?

06:51.027 --> 06:52.427
Ask Anna-Kat's teacher

06:52.495 --> 06:54.195
if she'd be willing to swap out
the drawing for another one.

06:54.264 --> 06:56.064
Can I do that?

06:56.132 --> 06:57.699
I can do that. Excellent idea.

06:57.767 --> 06:58.766
Why can't you think like this

06:58.835 --> 07:00.101
when you're deciding
what to write about?

07:06.943 --> 07:08.643
Taylor, I'm heading out.

07:08.712 --> 07:11.312
Dad's posing like Wonder Woman,
so you're in charge.

07:11.381 --> 07:13.915
Heat up some leftovers
for Oliver and Anna-Kat.

07:13.984 --> 07:15.783
Mom, uh, I-I'm not allowed to make lunch

07:15.852 --> 07:17.318
after the soup-can incident.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:31.334 --> 07:33.401
Oliver! What did you do?!

07:33.470 --> 07:36.271
You know, I could stay and make
the kids lunch if you want.

07:36.339 --> 07:37.705
You don't mind?

07:37.774 --> 07:38.907
Yeah, it'd be my pleasure.

07:38.975 --> 07:40.141
What about your kids?

07:40.210 --> 07:41.242
They're fine.

07:41.311 --> 07:43.244
They're overachieving as we speak.

07:47.117 --> 07:48.216
I'm watching you.

07:48.285 --> 07:50.018
Mom, don't be so naive.

07:50.086 --> 07:51.352
Can't you see what's happening?

07:51.421 --> 07:52.887
And what do you think is happening?

07:52.956 --> 07:54.355
Doris is playing you.

07:54.424 --> 07:56.791
She only wants to stay because
she wants to mess with me.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.226
Whoa, whoa. And Taylor.

07:58.295 --> 07:59.594
You see? She even admits it.

07:59.663 --> 08:02.530
Oh, Oliver, you're cute.
You think I'd take your side.

08:02.599 --> 08:05.767
Kids, Doris is in charge.
Teach them manners, Doris.

08:07.437 --> 08:09.470
All right, children.

08:09.539 --> 08:11.472
Welcome to Koreatown...

08:11.541 --> 08:13.007
the sketchy part.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.485
Mrs. Campbell.

08:24.554 --> 08:27.488
Mrs. Campbell is my transgender father.

08:27.557 --> 08:28.923
Please call me Maggie.

08:28.992 --> 08:30.825
Hi, Maggie.

08:30.894 --> 08:33.193
My name is Katie Otto.
I'm Anna-Kat's mom.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.964
I was wondering if I could talk
to you about her drawing.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.498
Of course.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.234
What seems to be the issue?

08:40.303 --> 08:42.736
Well...

08:42.806 --> 08:44.806
<i>Crap! She's a fellow fat.</i>

08:44.874 --> 08:47.108
<i>How am I supposed to tell her
I'm ashamed of my body</i>

08:47.177 --> 08:48.109
<i>without offending her?</i>

08:48.178 --> 08:49.978
The truth is

08:50.046 --> 08:53.147
Anna-Kat's dad doesn't like
how he's drawn in the picture.

08:53.216 --> 08:55.450
- Oh, my.
- There's kind of like a bald-spot issue,

08:55.518 --> 08:58.820
and he's very sensitive about what
the other parents are gonna think.

08:58.888 --> 09:01.089
People can see the bald patch
on his actual head, right?

09:01.157 --> 09:02.924
He wears a lot of hats.

09:02.993 --> 09:05.626
Oh. Well, this is
her only family portrait,

09:05.695 --> 09:07.895
but if you could get her
to draw a new one,

09:07.964 --> 09:09.630
I'd be willing to swap it out.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.332
Thanks for being so understanding.

09:11.401 --> 09:12.533
You're welcome.

09:12.602 --> 09:14.802
But tell your husband in my experience,

09:14.871 --> 09:16.604
children always draw the truth,

09:16.673 --> 09:19.140
so he should learn
to accept what he looks like.

09:19.209 --> 09:21.409
So...

09:21.478 --> 09:24.278
that kid has a dragon at home?

09:24.347 --> 09:25.813
I don't think so.

09:30.086 --> 09:33.087
Kids, lunchtime!

09:33.156 --> 09:34.522
Ugh! It smells like

09:34.591 --> 09:36.791
when our hamster committed
suicide in the vents.

09:36.860 --> 09:40.161
This is Auntie Doris' mixed meat stew.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.229
And none of you can leave the table

09:41.297 --> 09:43.064
until you finish your entire meal.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.399
But I'm on a juice fast.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.201
Stew is meat juice. Eat.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.496
Mom, I can't eat this.
I'm on a juice fast.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.939
Nope! Talk to Doris.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.775
- Anna-Kat, you're with me.
- What?

09:53.843 --> 09:57.278
That's fine. I didn't want
the little one anyway.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.579
Mom, can I be excused?

09:58.648 --> 10:00.314
Cooper Bradford is having a party

10:00.383 --> 10:02.750
and there's rumored to be
an Xbox One in a swag bag.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.652
Talk to Doris.

10:04.721 --> 10:07.188
You know what? Fine.
I'll play your game.

10:15.231 --> 10:17.465
Impressive stomach for a white child.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.067
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

10:19.135 --> 10:20.401
And where do you think you're going?

10:20.470 --> 10:21.769
Dude, I finished my stew.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.204
But your sister hasn't.

10:23.273 --> 10:25.139
And leaving the table
before your sister has finished

10:25.208 --> 10:26.808
is not what little gentlemen do.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.710
And I'm a grown-ass woman,
so don't call me "dude."

10:29.779 --> 10:32.513
- This is unfair. Mom!
- Shh.

10:32.582 --> 10:34.949
It's no use, Oliver.
I'm your mother now.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.421
Sweetie, Mommy loved
your family portrait so much

10:40.490 --> 10:42.290
that I want you to draw another one,

10:42.358 --> 10:44.759
preferably one where Mommy
is wearing her new shirt,

10:44.828 --> 10:46.494
which is a medium.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.629
I'm not sure I can make it
as good as the first one,

10:48.698 --> 10:49.964
but I can try.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.800
That's all I ask. Now start drawing.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.977
I love it, but I have some thoughts.

11:03.046 --> 11:04.779
You see how you drew Mommy as a circle?

11:04.804 --> 11:05.700
Mm-hmm.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.565
How about this time,
you try a different shape?

11:07.590 --> 11:08.649
Okay.

11:13.690 --> 11:17.325
Okay. This one's on me.

11:17.393 --> 11:20.072
You see how you drew Mommy
the same size as the house?

11:20.097 --> 11:21.005
Mm-hmm.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.931
Well, Mommy is in the house right now,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.634
so that's not right.

11:26.703 --> 11:29.604
Why don't you try to draw Mommy
inside the house?

11:29.672 --> 11:31.105
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.677
Oh, come on!

11:38.248 --> 11:39.647
We're playing hide-and-go-seek.

11:39.716 --> 11:42.750
You lost because everyone can
still see you behind the tree.

11:42.819 --> 11:46.220
<i>Obviously, I'm going to have to
take things into my own hands.</i>

11:46.289 --> 11:47.955
I have a fun idea.

11:48.024 --> 11:50.291
How about we do
this next drawing together?

11:50.360 --> 11:52.760
You draw everyone else
and I'll draw Mommy.

11:52.829 --> 11:54.295
Okay.

11:54.364 --> 11:57.398
<i>Let's draw my high-school body
with my now boobs.</i>

11:57.467 --> 12:00.334
<i>Heck, let's make them slightly
bigger, because why not?</i>

12:00.403 --> 12:02.136
Oh, my God. Hologram Tupac

12:02.205 --> 12:04.238
just started a second set
at Cooper Bradford's.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.367
Taylor, if you have any love for me,

12:06.453 --> 12:08.156
you will break your juice fast
right now.

12:08.273 --> 12:10.478
No! I'm doing this for the both of us.

12:10.547 --> 12:12.580
Remember when Mom
had trouble waking us up?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.148
Yeah, she tried everything

12:14.217 --> 12:16.951
until she invented throwing
that frozen washcloth at us.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.187
It is a beautiful day!

12:19.255 --> 12:21.455
Go outside and play!

12:21.524 --> 12:22.657
Exactly.

12:22.725 --> 12:25.059
If we cave, Doris will be
the new Señor Freezy.

12:25.128 --> 12:27.662
You know what? You're not as
dumb as everyone thinks you are.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.164
Thank you. Aah!

12:30.233 --> 12:31.666
- Mom, please!
- Mom, I fell again.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.935
I'm not your mom. Doris is.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.136
That's right.

12:36.639 --> 12:39.574
Just a heads-up... I'm going out
and Doris is in charge.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.430
Anna-Kat drew this?

13:07.937 --> 13:09.704
She drew it so much.

13:15.078 --> 13:16.310
What is that?

13:16.379 --> 13:18.212
It helps me see
the children's art more clearly.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.514
Mm-hmm.

13:26.689 --> 13:28.956
These are not Anna-Kat's crayon strokes.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.125
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

13:31.194 --> 13:32.693
Are you calling me a liar?

13:32.762 --> 13:34.795
I'm saying that you're lying right now,

13:34.864 --> 13:37.765
and you do it so naturally,
probably other times, too.

13:37.834 --> 13:40.468
Okay. I'm gonna level with you,
fatty to fatty.

13:40.536 --> 13:41.802
Fatty to fatty?

13:41.871 --> 13:44.138
My husband doesn't care
how he looks in the drawing.

13:44.207 --> 13:45.207
I do.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.674
You know how, here in Westport,

13:46.743 --> 13:49.010
people judge girls like us
for the way that we look?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.489
- No.
- Well, they do.

13:50.591 --> 13:53.414
I'm sorry. I cannot accept a forgery.

13:53.483 --> 13:54.803
What will my students think of me?

13:54.851 --> 13:56.851
They'll think nothing because they're 7!

13:56.919 --> 13:59.053
Look, I'd get this moral stance
if you were a real teacher.

13:59.122 --> 14:00.554
But aren't you taking this job

14:00.648 --> 14:03.591
at the community arts center
a little too seriously?

14:03.660 --> 14:06.527
I thought fat people
were supposed to be nice.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.797
You're fat! We are both two fat people!

14:09.866 --> 14:11.132
You know what? I'm taking this.

14:13.836 --> 14:15.469
No.

14:17.340 --> 14:18.639
I'm sorry, Mrs. Otto.

14:18.708 --> 14:21.175
But Anna-Kat's original drawing
will be displayed tonight.

14:21.244 --> 14:25.079
And for your information,
I don't think of myself as fat.

14:25.148 --> 14:28.149
Well, people who sit next to us
on airplanes do.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.472
<i>One of the strangest things
about being my size</i>

14:35.584 --> 14:37.404
<i>is you don't think about it
all that often.</i>

14:37.513 --> 14:38.770
See you at the art show, Katie!

14:38.795 --> 14:41.178
<i>But then life figures out
ways to remind you,</i>

14:41.373 --> 14:43.898
<i>like when joggers run around
you or kids draw you</i>

14:43.967 --> 14:46.534
<i>or you knock over a stranger's
drink with your hips.</i>

14:49.372 --> 14:51.172
Oh.

14:51.241 --> 14:53.040
There's nothing good
about this situation,

14:53.109 --> 14:55.409
so I am just gonna go.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.014
So, I'm trying to feed your kids

15:00.083 --> 15:01.516
and I was wondering
if it's okay to put them

15:01.584 --> 15:02.950
in some stress positions.

15:03.019 --> 15:06.087
Not Guantanamo, but Guantanamo-esque.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.522
Doris, no.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.190
Well, then I don't know
how to feed your kids.

15:09.259 --> 15:11.325
You know what? This is your fault. Yeah.

15:11.394 --> 15:13.194
For not crushing their spirit
when they were young.

15:13.263 --> 15:15.930
I don't think breaking your kids
down is the best thing for them.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.665
Of course it is.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.734
You tear them down
and then you build them back up

15:19.802 --> 15:22.737
into who you want them to be,
like Katie did with you.

15:22.805 --> 15:25.973
Working from home is impossible.

15:26.042 --> 15:27.241
What are you doing?

15:28.444 --> 15:30.077
Where are you looking?

15:30.146 --> 15:32.747
Oh, your crown moldings are filthy.

15:32.815 --> 15:35.082
I do this ritual.
It's the only way I can write.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.484
Well, then stop writing.

15:36.553 --> 15:38.319
It's not worth you losing
your dignity like this.

15:43.426 --> 15:46.494
Greg, I need you.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.135
Oh, my.

16:01.844 --> 16:04.312
Sweetie, I've got some bad news.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.416
Mama can't go to your art show tonight.
I'm not feeling well.

16:07.479 --> 16:10.229
- What's wrong?
- Well, do you know what a gallbladder is?

16:10.486 --> 16:11.719
- No.
- Great.

16:11.788 --> 16:14.255
Mine is broken,
but it'll be better tomorrow.

16:14.324 --> 16:15.423
Don't worry.

16:15.491 --> 16:17.225
Daddy's going to go to your art show.

16:19.295 --> 16:21.295
But I want you to go.

16:21.364 --> 16:24.298
Well, you'd think she'd be happy
I was going with her, but no.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.400
Her disappointment was very clear.

16:26.469 --> 16:28.052
Honey, come here.

16:28.169 --> 16:29.654
You got to snap out of this.

16:29.772 --> 16:32.373
I love you and you're beautiful
and I love you.

16:32.442 --> 16:34.575
Mostly, I love you for this body.

16:34.644 --> 16:37.878
I love all this. All this body.

16:37.947 --> 16:39.280
Are you drunk?

16:39.349 --> 16:41.215
- Quite.
- Right.

16:41.284 --> 16:44.285
Mama, this is for your girl bladder.

16:44.354 --> 16:46.454
Aww. Thanks, pumpkin.

16:51.995 --> 16:55.219
Actually, I'm already feeling
a little bit better.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.467
I have a feeling
you're gonna need this later.

16:59.492 --> 17:00.492
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:01.871 --> 17:03.804
Okay.

17:03.873 --> 17:05.439
Mm. Well.

17:05.508 --> 17:07.040
Oh, they're really rolling.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.209
Yeah.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.184
Look, Mama. My drawing's in the center.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.685
Isn't that neat?

17:18.755 --> 17:20.253
Let's go see it.

17:20.323 --> 17:22.290
Sure, honey. Just one sec.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.291
Can you help me gain the confidence

17:24.359 --> 17:27.328
to face an entire room
filled with women half my size?

17:27.396 --> 17:29.764
Mm. Mm.

17:29.832 --> 17:31.632
<i>He's a quiet drunk.</i>

17:41.544 --> 17:43.511
- Let's go see your drawing.
- Yay!

17:43.579 --> 17:44.912
<i>Suck it up, Katie.</i>

17:44.981 --> 17:46.314
<i>What's the worst thing
they could be saying?</i>

17:46.382 --> 17:48.416
<i>"That drawing looks exactly like her."</i>

17:48.484 --> 17:50.351
<i>"Maybe now she'll start exercising."</i>

17:50.420 --> 17:53.421
<i>"Katie Otto is so fat."</i>

17:53.489 --> 17:55.323
<i>Okay, I just hurt my own feelings.</i>

17:55.391 --> 17:56.924
I do not drink that much.

17:58.361 --> 18:00.461
Do I?

18:00.530 --> 18:02.263
At least you're in the drawing.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.964
That's my nanny.

18:04.033 --> 18:07.160
<i>Everyone in town is so self-obsessed</i>

18:07.371 --> 18:11.806
<i>that no one's even looking
at Anna-Kat's drawing.</i>

18:11.874 --> 18:14.775
<i>They're all focused on themselves,</i>

18:14.844 --> 18:18.012
<i>and everyone already knows
I'm overweight.</i>

18:18.081 --> 18:21.250
<i>All these moms
have serious issues to hide.</i>

18:22.452 --> 18:24.452
Westport is awesome!

18:31.361 --> 18:32.727
You guys having stew for dinner?

18:32.795 --> 18:35.062
No. This is still lunch.

18:35.131 --> 18:37.365
All right, this standoff ends now.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.539
Oh.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.511
Oh, God.

18:50.580 --> 18:51.580
That was pretty good.

18:52.749 --> 18:55.349
Meaty. And stewy.

18:55.418 --> 18:56.584
Go to bed.

18:56.653 --> 18:57.853
- That's a good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

18:59.856 --> 19:01.489
I just had another good idea.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.557
Mnh-mnh.

19:03.826 --> 19:04.826
All right.

19:05.662 --> 19:07.561
Katie, have a good night.

19:07.630 --> 19:10.064
Taylor and Oliver, see,
your mom and I are friends,

19:10.133 --> 19:13.067
so I'll be seeing you again and again...

19:13.136 --> 19:14.335
and again.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.870
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.173
Mnh-mnh.
I'm not done with either of you.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.309
Taylor, I need you to tell me the truth.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.010
What is this juice fast all about?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.553
Mom, I swear to you,

19:24.647 --> 19:26.013
it's just something fun to do
with the team.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.082
So you're not dieting?

19:27.116 --> 19:28.382
You're not doing this

19:28.451 --> 19:29.984
because you're scared you're
going to become fat like me?

19:30.053 --> 19:31.085
God no!

19:31.154 --> 19:33.554
Honestly, I don't think of you as fat.

19:33.623 --> 19:37.024
You're just... Mom.
You're really not even a person.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.127
This disturbs and pleases me
all at the same time.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.563
Now that you mention it,
you're not that big.

19:42.632 --> 19:44.131
It's mostly just boob.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.833
It is mostly boob, isn't it?

19:45.902 --> 19:48.438
Is that why you drew me big?
Because I'm mostly boob.

19:48.462 --> 19:49.382
No, Mama.

19:49.407 --> 19:52.239
I drew you big because you're
bigger than all the other mommies.

19:52.308 --> 19:54.342
Got greedy there. Felt it.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.977
Okay, as long as this juice fast

19:57.046 --> 19:59.580
is about having fun with your
friends and you being healthy,

19:59.649 --> 20:01.342
I'm okay with it.

20:02.585 --> 20:04.785
Do you even know why I'm mad at you?

20:04.854 --> 20:07.321
- Just a general overall thing?
- Exactly.

20:07.390 --> 20:09.990
Now go to your stupid friend's
house before I change my mind.

20:10.059 --> 20:11.225
Thanks, Mom.

20:13.162 --> 20:15.830
Oh, and I think Doris
might be a sociopath.

20:15.898 --> 20:17.031
Little bit.

20:34.710 --> 20:38.499
Now you're in the homework zone.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.592
Doesn't this concern you?

20:41.773 --> 20:43.573
Pretty sure it's a sign of genius.
