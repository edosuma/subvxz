What's up with her?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.120
Shh.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.800
She's sleeping.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.920
The water's
nice and warm.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.960
Let's stick her hand
in it and see if...

00:44.960 --> 00:46.880
Don't even
think about it.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.320
Hey, hi.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.640
When did you guys
get here?

00:52.640 --> 00:54.680
Just now. Why
are you so tired?

00:54.680 --> 00:57.800
I haven't gotten
any sleep in 3 days.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.960
Aunt Stephanie
is in town.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.040
Uh-oh.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.480
The snoring machine.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.640
It's unbelievable.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.240
The sound comes
right through the wall.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.040
It's like a lawnmower
in my head.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.640
There's a cure
for that.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.120
There is?

01:11.120 --> 01:13.520
Sure. Stick
cotton in her nose.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.240
It'll stop her
from snoring,

01:15.240 --> 01:16.760
or make her head
explode.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.240
A!

01:18.400 --> 01:19.840
Well, at least I got
a story out of it.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.800
You have a story
about a snoring au?

01:21.800 --> 01:23.760
No fool,
about house guests.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.240
It's fun havinvisitors,

01:26.240 --> 01:27.760
but when you invite
someone over,

01:27.760 --> 01:29.240
you'd better make sure

01:29.240 --> 01:30.840
you know what
you're getting into.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.240
'Cause even a cool visitor

01:32.240 --> 01:33.880
can overstay their welcome.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.240
But there's
another kind of guest.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.760
The kind that comes
by surprise.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.240
The kind
that comes uninvited,

01:42.240 --> 01:45.400
and totally unexpected.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.240
That's the worst kind.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.240
And in my story,

01:50.240 --> 01:51.960
there's a guest
who won't leave

01:51.960 --> 01:54.880
until it gets
what it wants.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.360

elevator tunes.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.920
Perch, you gotta
hear the music.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.680
No, man, you gotta
feel the music.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.680
How do you feel

03:15.000 --> 03:17.160
Upstairs in his room
playing a video game.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.320
I hope.

03:31.280 --> 03:35.160
Sherman,
this is awesome.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.320
Your dad must be
some kind of genius.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.640
Yeah, right.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.200
He's a research egghead.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.280
And don't call me Sherman.
I hate it.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.320
What kind
of research?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.160
Stuff with satellites.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.800
He doesn't
talk about it much.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.240
It's all top secret.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.680
Top secret?

03:53.680 --> 03:55.200
Un-pukin'-believable.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.680
Well, believe it.

it's gonna get us this.

it down for free.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.640
Yes!

04:15.880 --> 04:17.600
OK, we're online.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.120
Now all I gotta do is jump
a couple of security gates,

04:22.120 --> 04:23.840
and up into
the satellite.

04:23.840 --> 04:29.120
Man, my father could access
any satellite in the sky.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.120
He could probably dial
up the space shuttle.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.600
Yo, Sherman.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.880
What's
the peabody project?

04:35.880 --> 04:36.600
Don't!

will kill us

we're doing this.

looking at it.

What is it?

04:48.560 --> 04:51.600
It's dad's
big project.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.680
Something about deep
space communication.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.520
Deep space?

04:57.520 --> 05:01.600
You mean like, we could
dial up Captain Kirk?

snitches, we're dead.

You think, like...
I had a close encounter?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.919
No. It was probably
