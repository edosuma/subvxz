Hi, did you find him?

02:24.374 --> 02:25.474
No.

No, I, uh... I left pictures

02:27.344 --> 02:29.979
at 50 different places along
the road. Nobody's seen him.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.647
I called some hospitals,
too, and nothing.

Nothing?

What are we gonna do?

Mother, you have to stop trying

03:42.986 --> 03:45.321
to say that everything's fine, okay?

make? Fine, we'll take mine.

I need to go to Portland.

lay a lung transplant on you

I guess this is me telling you.

- Why?
- Ah, police brought you in.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.666

No, you were brought in alone.

No, I can't. Only the doctor can.

10:55.408 --> 10:57.509
This is a county facility.

10:57.510 --> 11:00.112
We're underfunded and overcrowded.

11:00.113 --> 11:01.146
If you want to complain to somebody,

11:01.147 --> 11:03.248
call your county commissioner.

Now, I've some questions
I'd like to ask you

11:04.784 --> 11:05.784
about your son.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.653
Yes, of course.

in a state of unconsciousness

11:09.823 --> 11:11.657

11:11.658 --> 11:14.927
He was extremely agitated and violent.

11:14.928 --> 11:17.329
The farmer was concerned
that your son was dangerous.

11:17.330 --> 11:18.764
Have you ever known him to be dangerous?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.365
No, not at all.

11:20.366 --> 11:21.934
He's one of the sweetest

He's very sensitive,

11:24.037 --> 11:27.005

these blackouts.

11:27.006 --> 11:28.674
Who is his doctor?

11:28.675 --> 11:31.343
He doesn't have one.

11:31.344 --> 11:35.347
He has blackouts, and you've
never taken him to see a doctor?

11:35.348 --> 11:37.382
He fainted at school. They
took him to a hospital.

11:37.383 --> 11:40.018
They ran some tests. They
didn't find anything.

11:40.019 --> 11:41.820
But he blacks out regularly.

11:41.821 --> 11:43.689
Well, I mean... it's just, it depends on

11:43.690 --> 11:44.923
what you mean by regularly.

11:44.924 --> 11:46.917

No, you cannot. He is under observation.

- Not until we've assessed him.

tell me that I can't see him?

Your son is 18.

12:32.338 --> 12:33.872
Legally, he is an adult.

12:33.873 --> 12:36.708
He is quite possibly
mentally ill and dangerous.

The time for you to take
care of him was before this.

- Emma Decody.

me she was having surgery.

Not so you'd come here.

I told you out of courtesy

conscience at her expense.

all that in the email.
