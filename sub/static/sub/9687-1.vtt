<i>Deborah?</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:09.325
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, T.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.335
- Are you cheating on me?
- No, no! I'm not cheating on you.

01:11.437 --> 01:13.928
- What...
- Stop it! What are you doing?

01:14.040 --> 01:16.031
- T! Stop it!
- You ain't leaving me!

01:16.142 --> 01:19.077
- Who is it?
- Nobody! It's you! I hate you!

01:19.178 --> 01:22.204
T. Ray, just let me go!

01:22.315 --> 01:25.341
No!

01:25.451 --> 01:28.007
<i>T. Ray, damn it!
Get off me!</i>

01:28.187 --> 01:29.714
Lily!

01:37.697 --> 01:41.064
<i>I killed my mother when I was four years old.</i>

01:41.167 --> 01:43.863
<i>That's what I knew about myself.</i>

01:43.970 --> 01:46.837
<i>She was all I wanted,</i>
<i>and I took her away.</i>

01:48.141 --> 01:50.041
<i>Nothin' else much mattered.</i>

02:38.457 --> 02:39.924
- T. Ray!
- What?

02:40.026 --> 02:42.187
There's bees in my room!
Hundreds of' em! You've gotta see!

02:42.295 --> 02:44.786
- What is it? Jesus Christ, Lily.
- They're in my room! Come see.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.865
What?

02:57.944 --> 02:59.844
Goddamn it, Lily.
This ain't funny.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.346
But they were here.
They were flyin' everywhere.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.814
You wake me again,
I'm gonna get out the grits.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.885
You hear me?

03:09.755 --> 03:11.723
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

03:24.203 --> 03:26.763
<i>The bees came the summer of'64...</i>

03:26.873 --> 03:31.742
<i>The summer I turned 14 and my whole life</i>
<i>went spinnin' off into a whole new orbit.</i>

03:31.844 --> 03:35.644
<i>Lookin' back on it,</i>
<i>I wanna say they were sent to me.</i>

03:35.748 --> 03:40.208
<i>I wanna say they showed up like</i>
<i>the Angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary.</i>

03:40.319 --> 03:42.583
<i>I know it's forward to compare</i>
<i>my small life to hers...</i>

03:44.024 --> 03:47.983
<i>but I have good reason</i>
<i>to believe she wouldn't mind.</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:19.582
So, um, my birthday is tomorrow.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.590
Most girls want...

04:24.698 --> 04:29.726
one of them little silver charm bracelets
they have down at the mercantile.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.432
Think I'm the only girl in junior high
doesn't have one.

04:37.111 --> 04:40.638
But I was just thinking you could tell me
about my mother instead.

04:40.748 --> 04:44.650
<i>All you ever said is she's from Virginia</i>
<i>and she's an only child like I am.</i>

04:44.752 --> 04:46.982
<i>I don't even know what</i>
<i>her favorite food was...</i>

04:47.087 --> 04:50.716
<i>and what she liked</i>
<i>to do and...nothin;</i>

04:58.666 --> 05:02.193
- You wanna know about your mama?
- Yeah.

05:03.304 --> 05:06.273
Mm-hmm.

05:06.373 --> 05:09.399
She used to spend hours
lurin' roaches and whatnot...

05:09.510 --> 05:12.206
out of the house with graham crackers
and marshmallows.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.909
Swear to God.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.013
She was a lunatic about savin' bugs.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.300
Here you go.

05:50.710 --> 05:54.669
<i>Hey, Lily! Nice ass!</i>

05:54.781 --> 05:56.749
Oh!

06:05.625 --> 06:07.593
Gotcha.

06:10.563 --> 06:14.294
Rosaleen.
Look at this thing fight.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.426
- What you doin' with that?
- Catching bees to show T. Ray.

06:17.537 --> 06:19.437
He thinks I'm making it up.

06:19.539 --> 06:22.201
Get yourself stung,
don't come cryin' to me.

06:22.308 --> 06:25.471
- Come fix this.
- For the future...

06:25.578 --> 06:27.159
What'd they do?
Drop the atom bomb or somethin'?

06:27.160 --> 06:28.741
Hush.

06:28.848 --> 06:33.046
It does say that there are those
who are equal before God...

06:33.152 --> 06:36.451
shall now also be equal
in the polling booths...

06:36.556 --> 06:38.888
in the classrooms,
in the factories...

06:38.992 --> 06:40.641
and in hotels and restaurants
and movie theaters...

06:40.642 --> 06:42.291
Holy shit.

06:42.395 --> 06:44.329
And other places that provide
service to the public.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.955
Today, July the 2nd, 1964...

06:47.066 --> 06:49.694
President Johnson signed
the Civil Rights bill into law.

07:09.322 --> 07:12.257
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18...

07:12.358 --> 07:15.486
19, 20, 21, 22.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.868
<i>When's my hair gonna</i>
<i>look like yours?</i>

08:35.642 --> 08:39.669
I bet mine used to drive you crazy the way
it goes off in 11 wrong directions.

08:41.414 --> 08:45.248
I bet you used to brush it a hundred times a day
just to get it to lay down.

08:47.387 --> 08:49.855
I bet you did.

08:50.923 --> 08:54.882
<i> Lily!</i>

08:54.994 --> 08:56.962
<i>Lily!</i>

08:58.631 --> 09:00.599
<i>Lily!</i>

09:05.705 --> 09:07.935
- Who you out here with?
- What?

09:08.041 --> 09:11.602
- Who's out there?
- Nobody. There's no one here but me. It's just me.

09:11.711 --> 09:13.645
Get up from there.

09:18.985 --> 09:21.351
Get in here.

09:21.454 --> 09:25.618
No! You think you're grown? Huh?

09:26.826 --> 09:29.818
Out there doing God knows what.

09:29.929 --> 09:33.160
You'll get yourself pregnant
and then what? Huh?

09:33.266 --> 09:35.291
Huh?

10:39.332 --> 10:41.300
You can go.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.879
Mornin'.

10:54.981 --> 10:57.609
How long your dad
keep you on these grits?

10:57.717 --> 10:59.685
Hour.

11:03.756 --> 11:05.747
Look at ya.

11:08.227 --> 11:10.354
Happy birthday.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.564
I didn't know you made me a cake.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.600
Of course I did.
It's your birthday.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.931
- How big a piece you want?
- Real big.

11:23.276 --> 11:25.676
You should be in the stand already.

11:25.778 --> 11:28.008
It's a big peach day.

11:32.185 --> 11:35.154
- Takin' her to town with me.
- What for?

11:35.254 --> 11:39.418
She needs a training bra.
She gots to get measured.

11:43.529 --> 11:45.520
How much something like that cost?

12:01.551 --> 12:03.815
Happy birthday.

12:10.927 --> 12:12.895
So what's in town anyway?

12:14.431 --> 12:17.025
I'm registerin' to vote.

12:17.134 --> 12:21.764
Rosaleen, news said a colored man in Mississippi
was killed for doing that.

12:22.906 --> 12:25.067
Good thing we ain't
in Mississippi then.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.474
I saw you scribblin' one of your stories
in the stand yesterday.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.776
Go on. Tell it.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.151
All right.

12:39.256 --> 12:41.315
So The Supremes,
they're heading down Highway 4...

12:41.424 --> 12:43.915
because they're going to Charleston
for a real big concert.

12:44.027 --> 12:45.927
But suddenly, their back tire blows up...

12:46.029 --> 12:48.259
and they go skiddin' across the road
and into a ditch.

12:48.365 --> 12:51.425
So then two are saying
that Diana's burnin' the peach cobbler.

12:51.535 --> 12:55.562
But she blocks the oven and she says, "I'm the
lead singer, and it's done when I say it's done."

12:55.672 --> 12:58.505
So I don't know what to do.
The Supremes are having a fight in my kitchen.

12:58.608 --> 13:01.509
- But then suddenly we hear...
- Hey.

13:01.611 --> 13:04.205
Ain't you Terence Ray's little girl?

13:04.314 --> 13:06.714
Yes, sir. Lily.

13:06.817 --> 13:09.718
<i>Daddy know you out here with her?</i>

13:09.820 --> 13:12.880
Rosaleen works for us.

13:12.989 --> 13:16.322
Whole lot of niggers been
coming through here today.

13:16.426 --> 13:18.986
You wouldn't be going to
that secret meetin', would ya?

13:19.095 --> 13:22.587
Well, hell, we ain't gotta
worry about this one.

13:22.699 --> 13:25.896
Can't register to vote
if you can't write your own name.

13:26.002 --> 13:30.371
Tell me, Lily. She a smart nigger
or a dumb nigger?

13:30.473 --> 13:32.168
- Please, mister, we really need...
- Answer me, girl.

13:39.115 --> 13:47.352
R-O-S-A-L-E-E-N.

13:49.092 --> 13:51.890
No!

13:53.163 --> 13:55.654
- Rosaleen! Stop!
- Put her there!

13:57.701 --> 14:00.329
Apologize!

14:00.437 --> 14:02.337
<i>Stop! No!</i>

14:02.439 --> 14:05.067
- Apologize!
- <i> Rosaleen, just apologize!</i>

14:06.309 --> 14:08.209
<i>Help! Somebody help!</i>

14:08.311 --> 14:10.211
Quiet.

14:10.313 --> 14:11.871
- Can somebody help?
- Apologize.

14:11.982 --> 14:13.745
Daddy!

14:17.320 --> 14:19.754
Your black ass gonna apologize
one way or the other.

14:24.661 --> 14:27.027
Rosaleen. Rosaleen.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.363
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- You have to help her.

14:34.471 --> 14:36.200
- <i> Get in the goddamn truck.</i>
- <i>I ain't restin;...</i>

14:36.306 --> 14:38.274
- till your nigger apologizes.
- I'm sorry, Frank!

14:38.375 --> 14:42.402
- I promised her!
- Get in the goddamn truck.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.449
She dumped snuff juice
on a white man...

14:46.549 --> 14:49.143
on Frank Posey, for Christ's sake.

14:49.252 --> 14:52.585
I wouldn't be surprised
if he flat-out kills her.

14:52.689 --> 14:57.456
You don't mean that.
He wouldn't really kill her.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.893
Sheriff s gonna take her to the hospital.
She'll be fine.

15:00.997 --> 15:03.488
Goddamn it. What the hell
were you thinkin'?

15:18.014 --> 15:20.312
Don't you leave this room, you hear?
I gotta settle payroll with...

15:20.417 --> 15:22.681
You don't scare me.

15:22.786 --> 15:25.254
- What'd you say?
- You're a coward.

15:27.254 --> 15:30.815
My mother would never let you touch me!

15:30.925 --> 15:33.519
That goddamn woman
give a shit about you.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.755
She loved me.

15:35.863 --> 15:38.161
I hate you!

15:47.608 --> 15:50.600
<i>Now you listen here.</i>

15:50.711 --> 15:55.546
Truth is, your sorry mama,
she ran off and left you.

15:57.385 --> 16:02.322
<i>On the day she died, she come back</i>
<i>for the rest of her things...not you.</i>

16:02.423 --> 16:04.288
That ain't true.

16:06.927 --> 16:09.327
It's not.

16:41.228 --> 16:43.628
<i>Dr. Cash, please call the page.</i>

16:43.731 --> 16:46.757
<i>Dr. Cash, please call</i>
<i>the page operator.</i>

16:57.178 --> 16:59.612
Rosaleen.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.511
They beat you again?

17:01.615 --> 17:04.948
We gotta get you out of here.

17:05.051 --> 17:08.419
- I can't get out of here. I'm in jail.
- You shouldn't be.

17:08.521 --> 17:10.990
That's gotta go.

17:17.263 --> 17:19.925
Rosaleen.

17:26.840 --> 17:30.208
- This is crazy.
- Oh, it'll be all right.

17:30.311 --> 17:32.108
It'll be all right.

17:38.052 --> 17:40.543
Shh.

17:55.836 --> 17:59.636
- A white girl come by here?
- Uh, no, sir. Nobody. I ain't moved from this spot.

18:22.096 --> 18:25.998
<i>When I was born</i>

18:26.100 --> 18:29.558
<i>My daddy said I was broken</i>

18:29.670 --> 18:32.639
<i>Beginning of the end</i>

18:32.740 --> 18:37.939
- You gals be careful now.
- <i>The life I hadn't chosen</i>

19:02.636 --> 19:04.797
Let me get this straight.

19:04.905 --> 19:07.135
You got us goin' to Tiburon...

19:07.241 --> 19:10.404
'cause your mama got a picture
with that town written on the back?

19:10.511 --> 19:12.536
That's it?

19:12.646 --> 19:14.910
T. Ray said my mother left me
way before she died.

19:19.687 --> 19:22.383
Well, it's not true.

19:22.489 --> 19:24.957
He only made it up to punish me.
I know he did.

19:25.059 --> 19:27.084
Knowing your daddy,
he could do a thing like that.

19:27.194 --> 19:29.856
And my mother could never do
what he said she did.

19:33.334 --> 19:35.234
Huh.

19:36.337 --> 19:38.396
I get it.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.530
You ran off 'cause of
what he said, didn't you?

19:41.976 --> 19:45.207
It ain't had nothin' to do
with me being in jail.

19:45.312 --> 19:50.375
And here you got me worrying myself sick
about you getting in trouble 'cause of me.

19:50.484 --> 19:54.750
So what you fixin' to do? Go door-to-door
askin' folks about your mama?

19:54.855 --> 19:57.346
- That's your bright idea?
- I don't exactly have a plan, all right?

19:57.458 --> 19:59.824
Well, you sure had one
back at the hospital.

19:59.927 --> 20:02.691
Comin' in there and sayin',
"We gonna do this, and we gonna do that."

20:02.796 --> 20:06.163
And I'm supposed to follow you
like some dumb nigger like they said.

20:06.267 --> 20:08.701
Well, you are dumb pouring your spit
on that man's shoe like that...

20:08.802 --> 20:11.600
and dumber not to say you're sorry
if sayin' it will save your life.

20:11.705 --> 20:13.798
That man was gonna come back
and kill you or worse.

20:13.908 --> 20:17.571
And I go and I get you out of there,
and this is how you thank me?

20:18.512 --> 20:21.003
Well, fine.

21:01.155 --> 21:03.055
Are you all right?

21:04.391 --> 21:06.484
I feel like I've been beaten
with a stick.

21:06.593 --> 21:08.857
You have been beaten, remember?

21:08.963 --> 21:11.761
But not with a stick.

21:20.541 --> 21:23.169
I know you can't understand.

21:23.277 --> 21:27.680
Apologizing to those men
would've just been a different way of dyin'...

21:27.781 --> 21:30.011
'cept I have to live with it.

21:33.954 --> 21:37.856
If I can find someplace open,
I'll buy us some food.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.119
What we gonna do for beds?

21:40.227 --> 21:42.559
Find a motel, I guess.

21:42.663 --> 21:45.757
Lily, there ain't gonna be a place
that'll take a colored woman.

21:45.866 --> 21:47.857
Well, what about
the Civil Rights Act?

21:50.004 --> 21:52.495
Ain't nothin' but a piece of paper.

22:02.616 --> 22:05.949
Excuse me, sir.
Are you serving food today?

22:06.053 --> 22:09.887
Oh, yes, ma'am. We have
a Sunday plate special: Barbecued pork.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.481
Um, we'll take two of those,
please, and two Cokes.

22:15.295 --> 22:16.887
I don't believe
I've seen you before.

22:16.997 --> 22:19.932
I'm not from here.
I'm... I'm just visiting my grandmother.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.366
<i>Your daddy's gonna be so proud of you.</i>

22:22.469 --> 22:24.266
- Afternoon, Carol.
- Hi.

22:24.371 --> 22:25.838
- Why, don't you two look smart.
- When we get home...

22:25.939 --> 22:29.272
You come on in, and I'll wrap
those up for you to go.

22:43.357 --> 22:45.985
Miss, you change your mind?

22:46.093 --> 22:49.426
- Where did you get those?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

22:49.530 --> 22:52.055
<i>Virgin Mary's pictured</i>
<i>as a colored woman.</i>

22:52.166 --> 22:55.135
<i>But, see, the woman that makes</i>
<i>the honey is colored herself.</i>

22:55.235 --> 22:57.533
Best honey in South Carolina.

22:57.638 --> 22:59.299
What is her name?

22:59.406 --> 23:02.204
August Boatwright.

23:02.309 --> 23:04.402
Do you know where she lives?

23:04.511 --> 23:09.107
Darnedest house you ever saw. Painted like
Pepto-Bismol. Your grandma's probably seen it.

23:15.122 --> 23:16.953
<i>What do you think's goin' on?</i>

23:17.057 --> 23:20.493
Look like they dressed for church.

23:20.594 --> 23:23.154
- Bye-bye!
- <i> You think one of them's August?</i>

23:23.263 --> 23:25.288
Whoever she is, I hope she make honey...

23:25.399 --> 23:27.560
better than she picks out paint.

23:28.602 --> 23:30.832
I like it.

23:50.390 --> 23:53.325
Now, don't go gettin'
your hopes up, all right?

23:53.427 --> 23:55.691
They got nowhere else to go.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.043
Yes?

24:15.149 --> 24:18.380
- Are you August Boatwright?
- <i>No.</i>

24:18.485 --> 24:22.444
I'm June Boatwright.
August is my sister.

24:23.657 --> 24:27.525
- You came to see her?
- Hi. I'm May Boatwright.

24:27.628 --> 24:31.086
I'm August's sister too.

24:31.198 --> 24:33.462
Is she expecting you?

24:33.567 --> 24:35.865
Um, I just saw some honey at the store,
and the man said that...

24:35.969 --> 24:37.960
You come for honey?

24:38.071 --> 24:42.371
Why didn't you say so?
Come into the parlor. I'll go get her.

24:42.476 --> 24:45.968
Then after that she gonna go get
September and October.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.520
<i>Who we got here?</i>

25:32.059 --> 25:34.687
I'm Lily and this is Rosaleen.

25:36.863 --> 25:39.423
We need a place to stay.

25:43.136 --> 25:46.469
You see, my mother died of tularemia when
I was little, and my daddy just got killed...

25:46.573 --> 25:49.633
in a tractor accident on our farm in
Spartanburg County, so me and Rosaleen...

25:49.743 --> 25:52.769
she's our housekeeper... we're on our way
to Virginia to stay with my Aunt Bernie.

25:52.879 --> 25:55.211
'Cept I don't have money
for a train ticket or a motel...

25:55.315 --> 25:57.340
and not that anyone
would take in a Negro woman...

25:57.451 --> 25:59.681
even though it's a violation
of the Civil Rights Act.

26:07.494 --> 26:11.555
- Looks like you've been beaten.
- She fell down some steps when we were leavin'.

26:11.665 --> 26:14.327
Must've been a lot of steps.

26:34.288 --> 26:37.655
May, honey, go on out to the wall
and finish your crying.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.425
Is she all right?

26:45.532 --> 26:47.864
I'm sorry.
We can't help you.

26:49.269 --> 26:52.500
We can't have 'em living
on the side of the road.

26:52.606 --> 26:56.042
Why don't you call your aunt,
see about her sending you some train fare?

26:56.143 --> 27:01.979
I would, but she just had a real big operation
and she's still stayin' in the hospital.

27:02.082 --> 27:06.451
<i>So maybe Rosaleen and I could just work</i>
<i>for the money, and then just be on our way.</i>

27:10.057 --> 27:12.525
Well...

27:12.626 --> 27:15.891
I guess Rosaleen can help
May in the kitchen...

27:15.996 --> 27:18.021
and you can help me and Zach
with the bees.

27:18.131 --> 27:20.463
August.

27:20.567 --> 27:22.899
We have the cots in the honey house.

27:26.239 --> 27:29.970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:32.946 --> 27:34.937
<i>I hope y'all like the smell of honey.</i>

27:35.048 --> 27:36.948
<i>It can be a bit overwhelming at first...</i>

27:37.050 --> 27:39.018
<i>but you'll get used to it.</i>

27:39.119 --> 27:43.749
Zach and I sleep out here come in December
when we harvestin' honey round the clock.

27:45.158 --> 27:48.855
It can get hot out here,
so you wanna keep that on.

27:48.962 --> 27:50.862
You'll have to use
the bathroom in the house.

27:50.964 --> 27:54.695
We never lock the door, so just come on in
whenever you need to.

27:54.801 --> 27:58.202
- There you go.
- This ain't charity. I'll pay you back for it.

27:58.305 --> 28:00.739
Oh, yeah, you can work it off.

28:00.841 --> 28:03.810
I imagine y'all two wanna rest up.

28:03.910 --> 28:09.678
If you get hungry, there's some sweet potato
biscuits on the stove. They're May's specialty.

28:09.783 --> 28:11.410
Thank you again, Miss August.

28:19.326 --> 28:23.353
I'm sure sorry to hear about T. Ray.
Aunt Bernie too.

28:23.463 --> 28:25.522
I know it wasn't right to lie,
but I didn't have a choice.

28:25.632 --> 28:28.226
How come you ain't say nothin'
about your mama or show that picture?

28:28.335 --> 28:30.235
Ain't that why we're here
in the first place?

28:30.337 --> 28:33.135
If they knew I ran away,
they'd have to call T. Ray to come get me.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.835
Then they'd find out you a fugitive
and they'd have to call the police.

28:36.943 --> 28:41.573
I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I really do.

28:41.681 --> 28:46.482
I just need some time to figure out why,
so don't say anything.

28:46.586 --> 28:49.646
Your secret.
You do what you want with it.

28:52.092 --> 28:54.322
They're so cultured.

28:56.229 --> 28:58.254
I never met Negro women
like them before.

28:58.365 --> 29:02.392
- Just us dumb ignorant ones.
- That's not what I'm sayin'.

29:06.206 --> 29:08.731
Guess I never met Negro women
like them neither.

29:08.842 --> 29:12.403
- How much land did she say they got?
- Twenty-eight acres.

29:12.512 --> 29:16.881
It's like it's got its own spot in the world,
where the outside don't come in.

29:16.983 --> 29:18.814
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i>

29:18.919 --> 29:21.285
We'll be safe here, right?

29:37.571 --> 29:39.471
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

29:39.573 --> 29:41.564
You know she in
some kind of trouble.

29:41.675 --> 29:44.337
Well, who's gonna
take 'em in if we don't?

29:44.444 --> 29:47.140
No one around here.

29:47.247 --> 29:49.477
So what if that trouble follow 'em?

29:53.286 --> 29:55.652
I need to do this, all right?

30:22.349 --> 30:27.446
<i>I went down to the water</i>

30:28.388 --> 30:30.879
<i>All night long</i>

30:33.827 --> 30:38.890
<i>I put my feet in</i>

30:39.699 --> 30:42.327
<i>All night long</i>

30:42.435 --> 30:46.269
<i>And I went down</i>

30:46.373 --> 30:51.003
<i>To the water</i>

30:51.111 --> 30:54.512
<i>All night long</i>

30:54.614 --> 31:01.315
<i>And I put my dreams in</i>

31:02.622 --> 31:07.059
<i>All night long</i>

31:08.461 --> 31:11.919
<i>And what you did to me</i>

31:14.034 --> 31:18.061
<i>I can't take no more</i>

31:20.407 --> 31:22.841
<i>I'll take these bad things</i>

31:22.943 --> 31:25.275
<i>And I'll</i>

31:25.378 --> 31:33.285
<i>Lay them at the shore</i>

31:57.210 --> 31:59.735
<i>You gonna break my car?</i>

31:59.846 --> 32:01.746
<i>No, I'm not gonna break your car.</i>

32:01.848 --> 32:03.213
<i>I'm just askin: 'cause you're</i>
<i>lookin' a little confused.</i>

32:04.684 --> 32:08.017
<i>It is hotter than a pot of rice, and you got nerve</i>
<i>to give me a hard time? Give me that wrench.</i>

32:08.121 --> 32:11.454
- No, you get it.
- Not gonna play, June Bug?

32:11.558 --> 32:13.583
You gonna play?

32:15.095 --> 32:17.120
- Come here.
- No. What?

32:17.230 --> 32:19.323
- Come here now.
- What are you doing?

32:19.432 --> 32:20.899
- You know what we doing.
- I don't dance.

32:21.001 --> 32:23.663
- Oh, you're dancin' now.
- No, I don't. I don't dance.

32:23.770 --> 32:27.103
- No, no. Get off.
- Come here.

32:28.608 --> 32:31.839
- <i>Come on, June.</i>
- Don't you pick me up.

32:31.945 --> 32:33.776
Stop it.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.348
Place a beehive on my grave

32:36.449 --> 32:40.010
<i>And let the honey</i>
<i>soak through</i>

32:40.120 --> 32:42.782
When I'm dead and gone

32:42.889 --> 32:45.824
- That's what I want from you
- Oh, thank you.

32:45.925 --> 32:48.792
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

32:48.895 --> 32:51.693
- <i>But I'll stick with my plot</i>
- <i> Mornin;</i>

32:51.798 --> 32:54.028
- Mornin'.
- You sleep all right?

32:54.134 --> 32:56.694
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>Come on. Grab yourself a chair.</i>

32:56.803 --> 32:59.897
- Okay.
- Hey.

33:00.006 --> 33:03.339
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

33:09.182 --> 33:12.515
- So, who's that man out there?
- <i> Oh, that's Neil.</i>

33:12.619 --> 33:15.019
He teaches at the school
where June teaches music.

33:15.121 --> 33:18.648
- He's sweet on her.
- It seems like she's sweet on him too.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.919
Yeah, but she won't say so.

33:21.027 --> 33:24.463
He tried every which way to get her
to marry him, but she won't.

33:24.564 --> 33:27.533
- How come?
- Too scared.

33:27.634 --> 33:30.535
<i>May, June might think that's a little personal.</i>

33:30.637 --> 33:33.697
<i>Hell, I'll tell any folk that'll listen</i>
<i>I threw my man out.</i>

33:33.807 --> 33:35.655
Put his brain in a bird
and the bird'll fly backwards.

33:42.549 --> 33:44.915
<i>Mmm.</i>

33:45.018 --> 33:48.181
How come y'all got names
from a calendar?

33:48.288 --> 33:50.017
Our mama loved spring and summer.

33:52.959 --> 33:56.895
We had an April too, but...

33:58.231 --> 34:00.699
she died when she was little.

34:10.844 --> 34:13.540
- You ain't gonna fix that car.
- I'm gonna fix it.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.219
- What set May off?

34:20.320 --> 34:22.947
She upset 'cause
you won't marry Neil.

34:24.858 --> 34:27.485
See that? You should go on and marry me
and quit upsettin' your sister.

34:27.594 --> 34:29.789
Get out of here.

34:29.896 --> 34:32.626
No, woman, you promised me pancakes,
and I ain't leavin' till I get 'em.

34:32.732 --> 34:36.259
You must be Rosaleen. Neil.

34:36.369 --> 34:37.835
- And you must be Lily.
- Yes, sir.

34:37.937 --> 34:40.963
What's burnin'?

34:46.880 --> 34:49.507
Don't worry.
We'll just make you another one.

34:49.616 --> 34:52.141
Or how about some grits?

34:52.252 --> 34:54.846
No. Thank you.
That's... That's all right.

34:54.954 --> 34:56.751
I'm just not really hungry.

34:56.856 --> 34:59.188
Then let's get to work.

34:59.292 --> 35:01.089
Check on May.

35:01.194 --> 35:04.527
I'm going to the N.A.A.C.P. Offices.
We're canvassing voters this morning.

35:04.631 --> 35:06.299
<i>Uh, wait.</i>
<i>What about my pancakes?</i>

35:06.299 --> 35:07.698
<i>Uh, wait.</i>
<i>What about my pancakes?</i>

35:07.801 --> 35:09.462
The batter's right there
by the griddle.

35:12.772 --> 35:15.036
Now how could beauty be so evil?

35:16.843 --> 35:21.507
I've been stung so many times,
I have immunity.

35:21.614 --> 35:23.809
They barely even hurt me.

35:23.917 --> 35:27.683
But since you don't, you need
to know beeyard etiquette.

35:27.787 --> 35:31.018
- Beeyard etiquette?
- You see...

35:31.124 --> 35:33.115
the world's really
just one big beeyard.

35:33.226 --> 35:35.990
The same rules work in both places.

35:37.430 --> 35:41.992
Don't be afraid, as no life-lovin' bee
wants to sting you.

35:42.101 --> 35:47.129
But don't be an idiot.
That's why we wear long sleeves and long pants.

35:47.240 --> 35:51.836
And don't swat.
Don't even think about swattin'.

35:51.945 --> 35:54.709
And above all, send the bees love.

35:54.814 --> 35:58.648
Every little thing wants to be loved.

36:01.087 --> 36:03.078
Let's go.

36:26.779 --> 36:30.306
Now, we'll constantly
be checking the hives.

36:30.416 --> 36:35.251
We have to make sure the queens have enough
room to lay their eggs, otherwise we get swarms.

36:36.956 --> 36:38.685
What do you mean, a swarm?

36:38.791 --> 36:43.023
When you get a queen and a group
of independent-minded bees...

36:43.129 --> 36:49.090
that split off and look for another place to live,
then you get swarms.

36:49.202 --> 36:51.170
And I lose my bees.

36:51.271 --> 36:54.536
So, what we have to do is...

36:56.009 --> 36:57.601
take out the frames
filled with honey...

36:59.245 --> 37:01.042
and put in empty ones.

37:09.255 --> 37:13.214
Now, the smoke, it calms the bees...

37:13.326 --> 37:17.126
and it masks the alarm scent
released by the guard bees.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.745
Why, you ain't scared a lick, huh?

37:39.852 --> 37:43.811
I love you. I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

37:43.923 --> 37:45.914
All right.

37:55.401 --> 37:57.301
Easy movement.

38:03.376 --> 38:04.934
See right there, Lily?

38:05.044 --> 38:09.140
That's the queen... the large one.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.784
<i>That wall behind the house...</i>

38:16.889 --> 38:19.483
Why does it have little pieces
of paper in it?

38:19.592 --> 38:22.254
Oh, well, that's May's wall.

38:22.362 --> 38:24.830
She made it herself.

38:24.931 --> 38:27.491
I guess you noticed
she a little different, huh?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.500
She sure gets upset easy.

38:32.205 --> 38:34.400
She had a twin sister, April.

38:34.507 --> 38:36.941
- The one who died.
- Mm-hmm.

38:37.043 --> 38:41.139
It's like the two of them were
one soul sharing two bodies.

38:41.247 --> 38:44.580
If April got a toothache,
May's gum would plump up red.

38:44.684 --> 38:47.676
One time my father used
a belt strap on April.

38:47.787 --> 38:51.188
I swear, welts rose up
on May's legs too.

38:53.693 --> 38:57.720
When April died, it was like the whole world
became May's twin sister.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.094
And we tried for years
to get her help...

39:00.199 --> 39:03.760
but the doctors just kept
telling us to put her away.

39:03.870 --> 39:07.397
So June and I come up with
this idea of the "wailing wall."

39:07.507 --> 39:12.001
- What kind of wall?
- The "wailing wall," like the one in Jerusalem.

39:12.111 --> 39:17.014
The Jewish people go there to mourn. See,
they write their prayers on tiny pieces of paper...

39:17.116 --> 39:19.050
and then they tuck 'em in the wall.

39:19.152 --> 39:22.417
And that's what Miss May does.

39:22.522 --> 39:28.119
Those bits of paper are
all the heavy feelings May carries around.

39:28.227 --> 39:30.821
Seems like the only thing
that helps her.

39:34.867 --> 39:37.461
Poor Miss May.

39:39.539 --> 39:42.303
Yeah. Poor Miss May.

39:53.286 --> 39:55.379
That's Zach's car.
He must be in the honey house.

39:55.488 --> 39:57.718
Why don't you go in and say hello.

40:02.862 --> 40:05.695
All right, this one's dedicated
to all my honeys.

40:05.798 --> 40:08.494
Oh... Don't worry.
You my honey too.

40:08.601 --> 40:13.129
<i>Baby, I need your lovin'</i>

40:13.239 --> 40:16.504
Got to have all of your lovin'

40:16.609 --> 40:20.978
Baby, I need your lovin'

40:21.080 --> 40:23.241
Got to have all of your lovin'

40:30.423 --> 40:33.119
I w... I was just singin'.

40:33.226 --> 40:35.524
I'm Lily.

40:35.628 --> 40:37.755
I'm staying with Miss August
and them for a while.

40:37.864 --> 40:41.766
Oh. Well, um, I'm-I'm Zachary Taylor,
her godson.

40:41.868 --> 40:43.665
Zachary Taylor was a president.

40:43.769 --> 40:47.637
Yeah, so I heard.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.436
Come here. Look.

40:50.543 --> 40:54.035
See? "Zachary Lincoln Taylor."

40:58.853 --> 41:03.916
Uh, Miss August told me about
you bein' here helpin' out.

41:04.025 --> 41:05.993
She didn't mention anything
about you being white.

41:07.462 --> 41:09.362
Maybe she didn't notice.

41:26.915 --> 41:28.815
Ooh.

41:35.457 --> 41:37.357
- Mmm, mmm.
- Just put it in.

41:37.459 --> 41:40.292
Miss August, you know
I got stung today, right?

41:40.395 --> 41:42.295
Did you? Where?

41:42.397 --> 41:44.831
Right there.
Probably can't see it much.

41:52.273 --> 41:54.298
No, I'm telling you that
they don't intend on voting.

41:54.409 --> 41:56.400
<i>But you gotta see it from the other side.</i>

41:56.511 --> 41:59.810
<i>The time is right</i>

41:59.914 --> 42:03.941
<i>I'm gonna pack my bags</i>

42:04.052 --> 42:09.888
<i>And take that journey</i>
<i>down the road</i>

42:11.092 --> 42:14.027
<i>'Cause over the mountain</i>

42:14.129 --> 42:17.098
- <i>I see the bright sunshine</i>
- Go. Let it go.

42:18.600 --> 42:23.003
<i>But I want to live inside the glow</i>

42:26.541 --> 42:29.009
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

42:29.110 --> 42:32.341
<i>I wanna go</i>
<i>to the place where</i>

42:32.447 --> 42:36.281
<i>I am nothing and everything</i>

42:36.384 --> 42:39.217
<i>That exists between</i>

42:39.320 --> 42:42.687
<i>Here and nowhere</i>

42:44.626 --> 42:47.959
<i>I wanna go the place where</i>

42:48.063 --> 42:50.429
<i>Time has no consequences</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

42:50.532 --> 42:52.432
- Hear the poppin'?
- Yeah.

42:52.534 --> 42:54.502
- <i>The sky opens to</i>
- It's from capping. Now you try.

42:54.602 --> 42:57.196
- Whoa. Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

42:57.305 --> 42:59.865
<i>I wanna go to beautiful</i>

42:59.974 --> 43:02.374
<i>Beautiful</i>

43:02.477 --> 43:06.140
- Put the uncapped frames in the spinner.
- <i>Beautiful, I wanna go to</i>

43:06.247 --> 43:09.683
- Pushes out all the honey.
- <i>Beautiful, beautiful</i>

43:09.784 --> 43:11.752
<i>Beautiful</i>

43:11.853 --> 43:15.084
<i>I wanna go to</i>
<i>beautiful, beautiful</i>

43:15.190 --> 43:18.284
Miss August says you can run like Wilma Rudolph.

43:18.393 --> 43:21.624
Yeah, in a championship game
I was running everywhere like...

43:21.729 --> 43:25.221
- Uh, hey, hey.
- Oh, no!

43:25.333 --> 43:28.268
<i>Beautiful</i>
<i>I wanna go to</i>

43:28.369 --> 43:31.566
<i>Beautiful, beautiful</i>

43:31.673 --> 43:34.767
<i>Beautiful</i>
<i>I wanna go to</i>

43:34.876 --> 43:37.106
<i>Beautiful</i>

43:38.346 --> 43:40.246
Hmm.

43:40.348 --> 43:43.010
- You want me to light your candle?
- Yes, ma'am.

43:49.724 --> 43:51.783
You all enjoy.

43:51.893 --> 43:54.020
Thank you, Miss May.

43:54.129 --> 43:57.860
She calls it a candlestick salad.

43:57.966 --> 44:00.799
She's been making 'em for me
since I was little.

44:00.902 --> 44:04.394
- It looks like...
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

44:04.506 --> 44:07.100
<i>May?</i>

44:07.208 --> 44:11.167
So, what's your favorite
subject in school?

44:11.279 --> 44:14.771
English. I was plannin' on
being a writer.

44:16.451 --> 44:20.854
I don't really think I got much of
a future now, being an orphan and all.

44:20.955 --> 44:26.086
Don't writers, like,
just imagine things you don't see?

44:27.996 --> 44:31.159
You should imagine yourself
having a future.

44:31.266 --> 44:33.791
That's what I do.

44:33.902 --> 44:37.360
Playing professional football?

44:37.472 --> 44:41.033
Why do white people always think sports
is the only way we could be successful?

44:41.142 --> 44:42.609
I wanna be a lawyer.

44:46.085 --> 44:49.418
I'm sorry. I just thought
'cause you were good at it.

44:49.522 --> 44:51.490
I've never heard of a Negro lawyer.

44:51.590 --> 44:54.024
You never heard of
Thurgood Marshall?

44:54.126 --> 44:56.788
- No.
- Forget it.

45:03.769 --> 45:07.865
All right. I'm picturing you
as a lawyer.

45:07.973 --> 45:12.103
Take the case of a girl who's wrongly accused
of hurtin' somebody.

45:12.211 --> 45:16.671
At the very last minute, you get the truth by
trickin' the real bad guy on the witness stand.

45:17.817 --> 45:20.980
You bust his ass with the truth.

45:23.956 --> 45:26.481
Yeah.

45:26.592 --> 45:29.857
Zach, the ass-bustin' lawyer.

45:33.666 --> 45:35.930
Oh. Thank you, May.

45:36.035 --> 45:38.003
- Here.
- No gravy.

45:38.103 --> 45:40.970
- Smells good.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

45:46.645 --> 45:49.170
So how are things coming
with you, Lily?

45:49.281 --> 45:53.308
Things are coming fine,
Miss June. Thank you.

45:53.419 --> 45:57.219
- I made banana daisy...
- You've been here almost a week now.

45:57.323 --> 46:00.656
Your aunt must be worried.

46:00.759 --> 46:04.024
If you want us to leave,
me and Rosaleen will be on our way.

46:04.129 --> 46:08.566
Oh, heavens to Betsy, Lily. Nobody wants you
to leave till you're good and ready.

46:13.942 --> 46:15.967
Why do you put a Negro Mary
on your honey?

46:16.077 --> 46:18.807
<i>You mean why is she black...</i>

46:20.115 --> 46:22.083
or why is she on the honey?

46:23.485 --> 46:26.579
- I guess both.
- <i> Tell her, August.</i>

46:30.992 --> 46:33.927
- I'm Sugar Girl.
- I'm Cressie.

46:35.763 --> 46:40.132
- I'm Doll.
- And I'm her daughter, Violet.

46:40.235 --> 46:43.170
And I'm Greta, Zachary's mama.

46:43.271 --> 46:45.364
Mmm, I love Sundays.

46:45.473 --> 46:47.441
What the hell kind
of church is this?

46:47.542 --> 46:50.557
It's been a while since
we told the story of our Mary.

46:50.558 --> 46:53.572
Mm-hmm.

46:53.681 --> 46:58.277
And since we have visitors here who've
never heard it, I thought we'd tell it again.

46:58.386 --> 47:01.287
- That's right. Tell the story.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

47:01.389 --> 47:03.380
<i>Back in the days of slavery...</i>

47:03.491 --> 47:07.018
our people would go
to the praise house on Sunday...

47:07.128 --> 47:09.619
and ask the Lord
to send them rescue.

47:09.731 --> 47:14.134
<i>One day a slave named Obadiah</i>
<i>was loading bricks onto a boat...</i>

47:14.235 --> 47:18.638
<i>and he saw somethin' that had</i>
<i>washed up on the shore.</i>

47:18.740 --> 47:21.004
<i>Movin'closer...</i>

47:21.109 --> 47:25.011
<i>he saw that it was the wooden figure of a woman.</i>

47:25.113 --> 47:28.571
<i>Her body was growin'</i>
<i>out of a block of wood.</i>

47:28.683 --> 47:31.379
<i>A black woman...</i>

47:31.486 --> 47:34.353
With her arm lifted up
and her fist balled out.

47:34.455 --> 47:36.184
<i>Mmm.</i>

47:36.291 --> 47:40.284
<i>Obadiah knelt down on</i>
<i>the wet sand before her...</i>

47:40.395 --> 47:45.355
- and to his shock he heard her voice clear as day.
- <i>Mm-hmm!</i>

47:45.466 --> 47:50.426
- She said, "It's all right."
- "It's all right."

47:50.538 --> 47:52.062
- <i>"I'm here."</i>
- "I'm here."

47:52.173 --> 47:54.073
"I'll be taking care of you now."

47:54.175 --> 47:58.509
<i>And Obadiah knew at that moment</i>
<i>that God had sent her.</i>

48:00.348 --> 48:04.546
Now, everyone knew the mother of Jesus' name
was Mary, and that she was strong...

48:04.652 --> 48:09.453
- <i>Come on.</i>
- And constant and had a mother's heart.

48:09.557 --> 48:12.253
<i>And here she was...</i>

48:12.360 --> 48:15.523
<i>sent to them across</i>
<i>the same waters...</i>

48:15.630 --> 48:18.793
<i>that had brought them</i>
<i>there in chains.</i>

48:18.900 --> 48:22.267
- Seemed like she knew everything they suffered.
- Everything!

48:22.370 --> 48:26.898
<i>And so the people went up</i>
<i>one at a time...</i>

48:28.243 --> 48:31.269
and touched their hand
to her chest...

48:31.379 --> 48:35.713
wantin' to grab on to
the solace in her heart.

48:35.817 --> 48:39.913
- Mary filled their hearts with fearlessness.
- She filled their hearts!

48:40.021 --> 48:42.888
And if they ever grew weak...

48:42.991 --> 48:44.891
they had only to touch
her heart again.

48:44.993 --> 48:46.927
Touch her heart!

48:47.028 --> 48:49.826
- Touch her heart.
- Touch her heart.

49:37.645 --> 49:39.704
<i>Touch her heart.</i>

49:41.316 --> 49:43.682
Lily.

49:43.785 --> 49:47.277
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

49:47.388 --> 49:49.288
No!

49:49.390 --> 49:51.153
- I'm your husband!
- Lily!

49:51.259 --> 49:53.159
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

49:53.261 --> 49:54.956
<i>Just let me go!</i>

49:55.063 --> 49:57.531
No!

49:57.632 --> 50:01.068
<i>... pray for us sinners now...</i>

50:01.169 --> 50:03.228
and at the hour of our death.

50:03.338 --> 50:06.000
- <i>Amen.</i>
- Lily!

50:08.509 --> 50:11.239
No!

50:11.346 --> 50:13.371
<i>June, what's gotten into you?</i>

50:14.248 --> 50:17.775
Oh!

50:17.885 --> 50:19.876
Lily.

50:23.791 --> 50:25.759
Girl, since when
you started faintin'?

50:29.263 --> 50:31.163
Could I get some water?

50:32.266 --> 50:35.531
- Of course.
- Wait. Um...

50:35.636 --> 50:37.729
Rosaleen, could you get it, please?

50:52.820 --> 50:54.788
This your room?

50:56.290 --> 51:00.727
- Blue is my favorite color.
- Mine too.

51:00.828 --> 51:03.388
Birds of a feather.

51:03.498 --> 51:07.298
- Sorry I messed up your church.
- Oh, that's all right.

51:07.402 --> 51:10.769
We go on all day if somebody
don't stop us.

51:10.872 --> 51:12.772
I just hope you all right.

51:18.379 --> 51:20.279
I think it was the heat.

51:21.449 --> 51:23.815
<i>Felt like it was</i>
<i>90 degrees in there.</i>

51:27.855 --> 51:30.483
Yes, the heat.

51:32.293 --> 51:35.751
Heat'll make a person
do strange things.

52:03.509 --> 52:07.946
I've made my reservation
I'm leaving town tomorrow

52:08.047 --> 52:10.248
I'll find somebody new
and there'll be no more sorrow

52:12.551 --> 52:15.019
That's what I do each time
but I can't follow through

52:15.120 --> 52:19.420
I can't break away
though you make me cry

52:19.525 --> 52:23.928
I can't break away
I can't say good-bye

52:24.029 --> 52:27.726
No, I'll never, ever
break away from you

52:27.833 --> 52:31.360
No, no
No, no, no, no

52:31.470 --> 52:33.665
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

52:33.772 --> 52:36.639
Who can think with all that?

52:36.742 --> 52:41.577
<i>Well, that's your problem...</i>
<i>You think too much.</i>

52:41.680 --> 52:45.343
Try going with your feelings
once in a blue moon.

52:45.451 --> 52:47.419
You won't believe what
people in town are sayin'.

52:47.519 --> 52:51.683
Sayin' Jack Palance is coming to Tiburon,
and he's bringing a Negro woman with him.

52:51.790 --> 52:53.451
<i>What in the world?</i>

52:53.559 --> 52:57.086
- Who's Jack Palance?
- He's a movie star... a white one.

52:57.196 --> 53:00.597
I ain't never heard...
l... I have never heard of him.

53:00.699 --> 53:02.894
<i>They say his sister lives here.</i>
<i>He's comin' to visit her...</i>

53:03.002 --> 53:05.368
and he intend to take this woman
to the theater on Friday.

53:05.471 --> 53:09.373
- <i>White folks talkin' about standin' guard outside.</i>
- <i> That's just talk.</i>

53:09.475 --> 53:11.272
<i>And these idiots are determined</i>
<i>to fight this law till they...</i>

53:11.377 --> 53:12.867
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

53:16.448 --> 53:17.915
- Miss May?
- Mm-hmm?

53:18.017 --> 53:21.077
I saw how nice you did
Rosaleen's hair...

53:21.186 --> 53:24.087
and I was wonderin' if maybe
you could help me with mine.

53:26.191 --> 53:27.806
That'll be easy.

53:29.374 --> 53:31.274
<i>Hmm.</i>

53:37.761 --> 53:40.821
It's ironic how white people
hate us so much...

53:40.931 --> 53:43.297
when so many of 'em
been raised by black women.

53:45.235 --> 53:47.897
- Place a beehive on my grave
- Ooh.

53:49.239 --> 53:52.970
June Bug! June, I know you hear me.

53:53.076 --> 53:55.840
If I make this shot, you'll give me your hand?
Watch this.

54:00.984 --> 54:02.975
<i>What you laughin' at?</i>

54:08.792 --> 54:12.023
You think somethin' bein' an impossibility
makes you think about it even more?

54:12.128 --> 54:14.596
- Like what?
- I don't know.

54:14.698 --> 54:17.223
Like... kissin'.

54:17.334 --> 54:19.962
That ain't impossible.

54:20.070 --> 54:24.063
When I was 15, I made
a 7 UP cake for this boy.

54:24.174 --> 54:26.904
After that,
he kissed me all the time.

54:27.010 --> 54:29.103
What'd it feel like?

54:29.212 --> 54:31.373
Like I was gonna burst.

54:36.186 --> 54:39.019
Miss May, I know you get
real sad sometimes.

54:40.056 --> 54:43.150
My daddy never feels.

54:43.260 --> 54:46.058
He never felt anything.

54:46.162 --> 54:48.596
I had rather be like you.

54:53.570 --> 54:56.232
A worker bee weigh less
than a flower petal...

54:56.339 --> 55:00.901
but she can fly with a load
heavier than her.

55:01.011 --> 55:04.572
But she only lives
four or five weeks.

55:06.283 --> 55:10.652
Sometimes not feelin' is
the only way you can survive.

55:19.829 --> 55:22.457
You want me to help you
make a 7 UP cake?

55:24.134 --> 55:27.126
Hold that.

55:40.717 --> 55:43.515
- It's purple.
- Yeah.

55:43.620 --> 55:47.351
When the weather turns hot,
the flowers, they start to dry up.

55:47.457 --> 55:49.925
The bees, they start sucking
on that elderberry.

55:50.961 --> 55:52.986
That makes purple honey.

55:54.130 --> 55:57.122
There. See?

55:57.233 --> 56:01.135
People'll pay two dollars a jar
for purple honey.

56:50.086 --> 56:51.986
- <i> I'm so lonely</i>
- You all right?

56:52.088 --> 56:54.147
<i> She'll be fine.</i>

56:56.359 --> 56:58.190
- <i> Because.</i>
- <i> No. Why?</i>

56:58.294 --> 57:00.990
- Why does it always have to come back to this?
- Because I love you and you me.

57:01.097 --> 57:02.797
Neil, I don't wanna get married.
I don't wanna get married.

57:02.798 --> 57:04.498
That's what people in love do.

57:04.601 --> 57:05.835
I don't wanna be married today
or tomorrow or ever.

57:05.836 --> 57:07.069
It's about that time!

57:07.170 --> 57:09.570
- What are you so scared of?
- I'm not scared of anything!

57:13.209 --> 57:15.575
Then you are the most
selfish bitch I ever met.

57:19.182 --> 57:21.082
What?

57:21.184 --> 57:23.084
What did you just say to me?

57:23.186 --> 57:25.450
- Oh, Lord.
- <i>What did you just call me?</i>

57:25.555 --> 57:28.251
<i>How dare you call me that, Neil.</i>
<i>Neil, I'm talkin' to you.</i>

57:28.358 --> 57:30.918
You better turn around
and listen to me right now.

57:31.027 --> 57:33.052
You better come back here
and apologize right now!

57:33.163 --> 57:36.599
<i>Don't you ever plan on comin' back then!</i>
<i>I don't even need you in my life!</i>

57:37.801 --> 57:40.861
How dare... Don't come back!

57:40.970 --> 57:43.962
- <i> Don't worry, May.</i>
- <i> Don't come back!</i>

57:49.045 --> 57:51.912
<i> I bet they'll be back holdin' hands</i>
<i>on the porch swing tomorrow.</i>

57:52.015 --> 57:56.714
I don't know, Lily.
Some people rather die than forgive.

57:56.820 --> 57:58.981
And June is one of 'em.

57:59.089 --> 58:03.355
She still hasn't forgiven me for paintin'
the house, and that was 10 years ago.

58:03.460 --> 58:06.952
Well, how come, if your favorite color is blue,
you painted the house so pink?

58:07.063 --> 58:09.395
That was May's doin'.

58:09.499 --> 58:11.899
She was with me the day
I went to the paint store...

58:12.001 --> 58:15.903
and she latched onto this sample
called Caribbean Pink.

58:16.005 --> 58:19.998
Said it made her wanna dance
a Spanish flamenco.

58:20.110 --> 58:23.705
I thought it was the tackiest color
I ever seen in my life.

58:23.813 --> 58:27.681
But if it could lift May's heart,
then I guess she ought to live in it.

58:27.784 --> 58:29.752
Well, that was sure nice of you.

58:29.853 --> 58:33.380
Well, some things
don't matter that much, Lily.

58:33.490 --> 58:36.357
Like the color
of a house and whatnot.

58:36.459 --> 58:39.087
But liftin' someone's heart...
now <i>that</i> matters.

58:40.597 --> 58:44.124
- Were you ever in love?
- Course I was.

58:44.234 --> 58:47.169
- But you didn't love him enough to marry him.
- Well, I loved him enough.

58:47.270 --> 58:50.433
I just loved my freedom more.

58:50.540 --> 58:55.136
I can't think of one thing I'd rather have
than somebody loving me.

58:59.315 --> 59:00.805
Where are all the bees?

59:05.800 --> 59:08.667
You hear that?

59:08.769 --> 59:10.964
They're coolin' the hive.

59:11.072 --> 59:15.008
That's the sound of 100,000
bee wings fannin' the air.

59:18.145 --> 59:22.605
People have no idea about the complicated life
goin' on inside a beehive.

59:22.717 --> 59:24.981
Here. Let me help you with that.

59:25.086 --> 59:29.955
See, bees have a secret life
we don't know anything about.

59:41.235 --> 59:43.169
<i>Yeah!</i>

59:44.505 --> 59:47.065
<i>Well, if this ain't the livin' end.</i>

59:47.174 --> 59:48.835
Now come over here. You gonna get wet.

59:48.943 --> 59:52.071
Oh, Lord, Lord!

59:54.949 --> 59:59.386
Would you keep it down?

59:59.487 --> 01:00:03.184
- Keep it down! I'm practicin'.
- You come over here, you gonna get wet.

01:00:05.026 --> 01:00:07.654
- Oh, damn it to hell!
- Run, Lily!

01:00:07.762 --> 01:00:09.730
Oh, damn it to hell!

01:00:12.099 --> 01:00:14.693
How dare you!

01:00:14.802 --> 01:00:17.327
- <i> You out of your mind?</i>
- All right now, June.

01:00:20.341 --> 01:00:22.502
<i>Come on, June.</i>

01:01:24.405 --> 01:01:26.669
- Where you goin', June?
- June?

01:01:26.774 --> 01:01:29.208
Come on back.

01:01:36.183 --> 01:01:38.913
<i>Oh. Miss May.</i>

01:01:39.019 --> 01:01:41.954
Got thirsty.

01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:02.167
I saw a roach.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.148
<i>The roaches will</i>
<i>follow this right out the door.</i>

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:27.522
Works every time.

01:02:30.764 --> 01:02:33.528
Miss May?

01:02:33.633 --> 01:02:35.897
Did you know a Deborah?

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.902
Deborah Owens?

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.405
<i>She's a white woman from Virginia.</i>

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:45.306
It would've been a long time ago.

01:02:45.412 --> 01:02:47.676
Oh, yes.

01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:50.147
Deborah Owens.

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:53.083
She stayed out in the honey house.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:56.417
She was the sweetest thing.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:15.170
Think I'll go out
to the wall for a while.

01:03:34.361 --> 01:03:37.262
Give it back!

01:03:42.936 --> 01:03:45.370
<i>Zach! Come back here.</i>

01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:53.111
Thank you.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.347
<i>Hey. Lily, come ride with me.</i>

01:03:59.452 --> 01:04:02.649
Uh, I gotta drop some honey off
to Mr. Forrest. I want you to meet him.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.156
Oh, I gotta talk to Miss August.
You know where she is?

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:09.251
Uh, she went to Columbia to go pick up
a new blade for the spinner.

01:04:09.362 --> 01:04:11.262
Oh.

01:04:22.675 --> 01:04:27.112
<i>Thought a new notebook might</i>
<i>help you start writin' again.</i>

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:31.816
Whoa.

01:04:39.526 --> 01:04:42.324
My mother stayed in
the honey house, just like me.

01:04:42.429 --> 01:04:45.626
What? When?

01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:48.929
I don't know.
I don't know anything about her.

01:04:49.035 --> 01:04:53.631
Maybe it was before I was born.
Or maybe she left me like my daddy said.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.640
So, wait.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:59.640
You mean to tell me...

01:04:59.746 --> 01:05:02.180
all that stuff about your aunt...

01:05:02.282 --> 01:05:04.876
and... and just passin' through...

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.282
You made that up?

01:05:09.022 --> 01:05:11.286
Why not just tell the truth?

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:15.192
'Cause I'm afraid the truth
is gonna wreck everything.

01:05:39.986 --> 01:05:41.886
<i>There he is.</i>

01:05:41.988 --> 01:05:43.819
And who might
this pretty young lady be?

01:05:43.923 --> 01:05:47.017
This is Lily.
She's stayin' with Miss August.

01:05:47.126 --> 01:05:50.323
- You stayin' in her house?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:54.730
Well, Miss August is a good friend of mine.
I hope you're enjoyin' yourself.

01:05:54.834 --> 01:05:57.667
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with the dentist.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.567
Okay.

01:05:59.672 --> 01:06:04.075
- <i> What you working on?</i>
- <i>Run-of-the-mill stuff.</i>

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:07.578
<i>Hey, I got somethin' for you.</i>
<i>Wanna head up to the office?</i>

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.410
Are you, uh, lookin' forward
to school gettin' started up?

01:06:10.411 --> 01:06:13.141
Yes, sir. And football season...

01:06:13.253 --> 01:06:15.483
Oh, yeah.
We're lookin' forward to that.

01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:51.456
Hello. Operator.

01:06:51.558 --> 01:06:54.925
I'd like to make a call
to Sylvan 7-1710.

01:06:55.028 --> 01:06:57.963
Hold while I connect
your call, please.

01:07:02.368 --> 01:07:05.394
Hello? Hello!

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:14.676
Look what he gave me.
I'm startin' my law library.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.942
That's nice.

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:18.950
Hey.

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:25.152
Lily, I know you're scared
the truth is gonna wreck things.

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:27.988
Findin' out the truth
is only half of it.

01:07:29.195 --> 01:07:32.028
It's what you do with it
that matters.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.031
Right?

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.806
When's the last time
you seen a movie?

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.810
I don't remember.

01:07:45.912 --> 01:07:48.039
Come on. We gonna go see <i>Surf Party.</i>

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:51.605
- But what...
- But nothin'. Come on. Let's go.

01:08:00.126 --> 01:08:01.923
- One adult, please.
- Here you go.

01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:04.863
It can't hurt, you know?

01:08:08.843 --> 01:08:10.834
<i>One adult and one child.</i>

01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:15.544
<i>Everybody waxed up?</i>

01:08:15.649 --> 01:08:19.415
- <i>This is a surfboard.</i>
- <i> You're kidding.</i>

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.978
<i>This is the nose.</i>
<i>The sides are called rails.</i>

01:08:24.692 --> 01:08:26.660
Thank you.

01:08:29.763 --> 01:08:32.129
- <i>The first step</i> is...
- <i> Come on!</i>

01:08:32.933 --> 01:08:35.367
Hey, boy!

01:08:35.469 --> 01:08:38.029
- We're gonna teach you a lesson, boy!
- Hey! It's not his fault!

01:08:38.139 --> 01:08:39.868
Let him go!

01:08:39.974 --> 01:08:42.738
Shut your mouth, nigger lover!

01:08:42.843 --> 01:08:46.870
- <i> Where are they takin' him?</i>
- Get him in the truck.

01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:49.745
- Just trying to gather up all the pieces.
- You're wastin' time!

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:51.750
- You know who took him.
- Is that right?

01:08:51.852 --> 01:08:54.319
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
- All right. Now hold on here, folks.

01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:56.854
<i>Soon as we know anything,</i>
<i>we'll get back to you.</i>

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:59.687
Neil, counselor, ladies.
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.066
I'm gonna get some men together.
We'll look ourselves.

01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:08.828
If you'll have me,
I'm willin' to help.

01:09:16.343 --> 01:09:18.368
May doesn't need to know about this.

01:09:23.184 --> 01:09:25.913
Nah, it'll be too much.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.620
<i>Black boys don't come back, August.</i>

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:39.130
<i> He's gonna be found,</i>
<i>and he's gonna be all right.</i>

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:41.929
- <i> How could you say that?</i>
- <i>I have to.</i>

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.985
Please let him be okay.

01:10:23.444 --> 01:10:25.435
Lily's gonna look so pretty in this.

01:10:31.252 --> 01:10:33.982
August, where are your scissors?

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:37.486
Uh, in my room.

01:10:50.337 --> 01:10:54.000
- <i>Hey, Greta.</i>
- Hey, May.

01:10:54.108 --> 01:10:56.008
You been to see Mary?

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.978
Zach is still missin'.

01:11:03.784 --> 01:11:06.981
We have to pray, May.
You understand?

01:11:07.087 --> 01:11:09.282
We got to pray, May.

01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:38.550
- <i> Who was at the door?</i>
- <i>May, was somebody at the door?</i>

01:11:41.722 --> 01:11:43.622
Greta.

01:11:44.892 --> 01:11:47.292
No news on Zach.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:58.905
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:00.741 --> 01:12:03.539
You all right?

01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:08.247
May?

01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:10.442
May!

01:12:11.552 --> 01:12:13.179
<i>Answer me, May.</i>
<i>You all right?</i>

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.755
What's happened to her?
I never seen her like this.

01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:19.656
- May?
- May?

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.660
May.

01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:25.788
I'm all right.

01:12:28.068 --> 01:12:30.195
Glad to see you can talk.

01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:34.071
Come on, Sister.

01:12:34.174 --> 01:12:36.506
We gonna run you a nice hot bath.

01:12:37.878 --> 01:12:40.438
I need to go to the wall.

01:12:51.291 --> 01:12:53.191
May?

01:12:53.293 --> 01:12:55.727
Where's May?
Her bath is ready.

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.990
She's still out there.

01:13:04.605 --> 01:13:06.664
May?

01:13:08.075 --> 01:13:09.975
May?

01:13:11.545 --> 01:13:13.445
May!

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:18.675
May?

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.015
<i>May!</i>

01:13:22.122 --> 01:13:24.420
- May?
- <i>May!</i>

01:13:26.293 --> 01:13:28.784
- May?
- <i>May!</i>

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.856
<i>Come on, May.</i>

01:13:40.774 --> 01:13:42.674
<i>May?</i>

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.380
<i>May?</i>

01:13:51.585 --> 01:13:53.485
June?

01:13:56.156 --> 01:13:58.454
<i>May!</i>

01:14:05.332 --> 01:14:10.031
<i>June! June!</i>

01:14:10.137 --> 01:14:12.799
May!

01:14:12.906 --> 01:14:16.239
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! August!

01:14:19.346 --> 01:14:21.541
August.

01:14:32.626 --> 01:14:37.063
No!
Oh, no!

01:14:37.164 --> 01:14:40.327
- Oh, no!
- Oh, May.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:46.671
<i> We gotta get her out.</i>
<i>We gotta get her out.</i>

01:14:54.147 --> 01:14:59.050
<i>May!</i>

01:14:59.152 --> 01:15:01.313
Why you do that?

01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:08.919
Sweet Mary.

01:16:16.496 --> 01:16:18.964
<i>Zach!</i>

01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:23.095
Zach.

01:16:27.074 --> 01:16:29.599
<i>Oh.</i>

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.610
I'm so sorry.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:33.771
Miss May did what she did
'cause of me.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.474
<i>Come on, now.</i>
<i>It was May who did it.</i>

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:39.984
It's all right.
She wouldn't want you blaming yourself.

01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:46.489
Oh. It's gonna be okay.

01:16:49.696 --> 01:16:51.755
It's good. It's good.

01:17:20.127 --> 01:17:23.619
<i>Dear August and June...</i>

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:26.858
<i>I'm sorry to leave you like this.</i>

01:17:26.967 --> 01:17:29.595
<i>But I know Zach is okay.</i>

01:17:29.703 --> 01:17:32.570
<i>My heart is telling me so.</i>

01:17:32.673 --> 01:17:34.573
<i>I hate you bein'sad...</i>

01:17:34.675 --> 01:17:38.736
<i>but think how happy I'll be</i>
<i>with April, Mama and Papa.</i>

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.947
<i>I'm tired of carrying around</i>
<i>the weight of the world.</i>

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.109
<i>I'm just gonna lay it down now.</i>

01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:48.653
<i>It's my time to die...</i>

01:17:48.755 --> 01:17:51.451
<i>and it's your time to live.</i>

01:17:51.558 --> 01:17:54.686
<i>Don't mess it up.</i>

01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:57.454
<i>Love, May.</i>

01:18:10.677 --> 01:18:12.577
<i>I saw Mary</i>

01:18:12.679 --> 01:18:15.842
<i>She was walkin' on the water</i>

01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:18.611
<i>Smilin' at me</i>

01:18:18.719 --> 01:18:22.917
<i>Hummin' her river song</i>

01:18:23.023 --> 01:18:24.923
<i>And I tried wavin'</i>

01:18:25.025 --> 01:18:27.755
<i>But she was walkin' away</i>

01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:31.524
<i>She said that</i>
<i>she'd been waitin' on me</i>

01:18:31.631 --> 01:18:35.294
<i>All day long</i>

01:18:46.913 --> 01:18:51.612
<i>I tried to call her and said</i>
<i>Please come back</i>

01:18:51.718 --> 01:18:57.088
<i>'Cause I didn't mean</i>
<i>to make you sad</i>

01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:59.090
<i>She said</i>

01:18:59.192 --> 01:19:03.526
<i>Well, don't you worry</i>
<i>'cause I'll see you again</i>

01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:06.656
<i>But I hear my mother call</i>

01:19:06.767 --> 01:19:09.736
<i>And I have to go</i>

01:20:04.191 --> 01:20:09.356
Place a beehive on my grave

01:20:09.462 --> 01:20:13.057
And let the honey
soak through

01:20:14.501 --> 01:20:18.369
When I'm dead and gone

01:20:18.471 --> 01:20:23.101
That's what I want from you

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:28.170
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:31.011
But I'll stick with my plot

01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:34.484
And a pot of honey

01:20:34.588 --> 01:20:39.150
Place a beehive on my grave

01:20:39.259 --> 01:20:43.252
And let the honey
soak through

01:20:46.533 --> 01:20:48.433
Hmm.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.640
<i>I see you liked yours.</i>

01:20:55.742 --> 01:20:57.573
- Mm-hmm. It's the last one.
- Mmm.

01:20:57.677 --> 01:20:59.736
Mmm, girl, you did all right.

01:20:59.846 --> 01:21:02.371
Aw. I'm the eldest.

01:21:02.482 --> 01:21:05.246
- And the slowest.
- I'll make some more.

01:21:05.352 --> 01:21:08.412
- You hear that, June?
- Hmm.

01:21:08.521 --> 01:21:12.252
Think we might need
to change your name, Rosaleen.

01:21:12.359 --> 01:21:16.056
From now on, we gonna call you July.

01:21:18.265 --> 01:21:21.428
<i>Hmm. I concur.</i>

01:21:23.203 --> 01:21:25.569
<i>Some more of these.</i>

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.134
<i>Mmm.</i>

01:21:35.115 --> 01:21:37.777
Sure you gonna be
all right in here by yourself?

01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:45.588
I don't mind sharing May's room.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.593
Just wanna be near her spirit.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.595
I'll be fine.

01:21:52.799 --> 01:21:54.699
See you in the mornin' then.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.798
Hey, Lily.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:30.199
This is my mother.

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.811
I know, honey.

01:22:41.214 --> 01:22:45.048
Your mama was
Deborah Fontanel Owens.

01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:47.051
You've known all this time?

01:22:47.153 --> 01:22:50.987
I knew she had a daughter.
But I thought it couldn't be you.

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:55.858
But one look at you,
all I could see is Deborah at your age.

01:22:55.962 --> 01:22:57.759
You knew her when she was little?

01:22:57.864 --> 01:23:00.833
I took care of her.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:03.596
Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:03.703 --> 01:23:07.036
Somethin' told me you wasn't
quite ready to know about her.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:12.043
I just wanted to give you a chance
to get on solid ground first.

01:23:14.647 --> 01:23:16.808
T. Ray...

01:23:16.916 --> 01:23:18.941
he told me that my mo...

01:23:20.253 --> 01:23:23.450
He told me my mother
left me and ran away.

01:23:26.259 --> 01:23:29.490
I don't have any memory of her, but...

01:23:29.596 --> 01:23:33.896
I know he's lyin'
'cause some things aren't possible.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.560
Children just don't have two parents
who refuse to love 'em.

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:40.127
Is that what made you leave?

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.438
I know what I did was wrong.
I just seem to do all the wrong things.

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:49.274
I don't mean to be a bad person,
but I just can't help it.

01:23:49.382 --> 01:23:53.580
So that's why I gotta go.
I brought the outside in here.

01:23:53.686 --> 01:23:56.814
And what happened
to Zach and Miss May...

01:23:56.923 --> 01:23:59.949
If I'd never come here,
it would've never happened.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.153
- Lily... Lily, that wasn't your fault.
- I wreck everything.

01:24:02.262 --> 01:24:04.321
Yes, it was.

01:24:04.431 --> 01:24:08.231
They were fightin' and screamin' and...

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:12.065
She grabbed a gun, and he took it away from her,
and I just wanted to help her.

01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:14.868
I just wanted to
give it back to her.

01:24:14.974 --> 01:24:17.238
- And I killed her.
- Who, Lily?

01:24:17.343 --> 01:24:20.642
My mother.
I killed my mother.

01:24:22.382 --> 01:24:25.010
I'm unlovable.

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:33.318
Oh, Lily.

01:24:34.594 --> 01:24:36.494
You listen to me now.

01:24:39.566 --> 01:24:42.467
That's a terrible,
terrible thing for you to live with.

01:24:44.003 --> 01:24:47.404
But you're not unlovable, child.

01:24:47.507 --> 01:24:49.805
There's love all around you.

01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:56.375
Gimme your hand.

01:25:03.253 --> 01:25:06.814
<i>I started takin' care of Deborah</i>
<i>when she was nine, back in Virginia.</i>

01:25:06.924 --> 01:25:08.915
<i>Over seven years.</i>

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:12.962
<i>Till my grandmama died</i>
<i>and left me this place.</i>

01:25:13.063 --> 01:25:16.521
That's why June
resented you at first.

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:20.364
She never got over me
workin' in your mama's house.

01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:22.371
How did my mother get down here?

01:25:24.475 --> 01:25:28.036
She had an old friend from high school,
moved to Sylvan.

01:25:28.145 --> 01:25:32.172
Told her there were jobs,
and men back from the war.

01:25:32.282 --> 01:25:34.250
So she moved.

01:25:34.351 --> 01:25:36.410
I think it was 'cause of me though.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.284
I just think she wanted me nearby.

01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:43.952
So my mother came to Sylvan,
met T. Ray and got married.

01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:45.961
That's right.

01:25:46.063 --> 01:25:48.122
But what I don't get
is why she married him.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.664
I think Deborah liked the fact
that he was decorated in the war.

01:25:54.772 --> 01:25:56.672
She thought he was brave.

01:25:56.774 --> 01:25:58.833
Said he treated her like a princess.

01:25:58.942 --> 01:26:01.536
It's not the same T. Ray.
I can tell you that right now.

01:26:03.747 --> 01:26:07.239
You know, Lily,
people can start out one way...

01:26:07.351 --> 01:26:12.516
<i>and by the time life get through with 'em,</i>
<i>end up completely different.</i>

01:26:12.623 --> 01:26:16.719
<i>I mean, I don't doubt that he started off</i>
<i>lovin' her. Fact, he worshipped her.</i>

01:26:16.827 --> 01:26:22.026
<i>But after about six months or so,</i>
<i>her love wore off.</i>

01:26:22.132 --> 01:26:24.396
But she married him?

01:26:24.501 --> 01:26:27.902
<i>But if the love had worn off,</i>
<i>why did she marry him?</i>

01:26:29.873 --> 01:26:33.365
Honey, Deborah was pregnant.

01:26:33.477 --> 01:26:35.377
That's why.

01:26:42.252 --> 01:26:44.220
She called me
soon after you were born.

01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:48.223
<i>I got letters and phone calls,</i>
<i>mostly about you.</i>

01:26:48.325 --> 01:26:52.921
How you were sittin' up
and takin' your first steps.

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:55.464
<i>Playin' patty-cake.</i>

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.134
<i>But then the letters</i>
<i>start comin' less and less.</i>

01:27:01.238 --> 01:27:03.798
And one day she called me up...

01:27:03.907 --> 01:27:06.774
and she said she was leavin' T. Ray.

01:27:06.877 --> 01:27:09.038
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:27:09.146 --> 01:27:12.309
<i> When I picked her up</i>
<i>from the bus station...</i>

01:27:12.416 --> 01:27:14.316
<i>she didn't even look like herself.</i>

01:27:15.586 --> 01:27:17.486
<i>She had gotten so thin.</i>

01:27:17.588 --> 01:27:20.682
I was with her when you picked her up
from the bus station, right?

01:27:23.093 --> 01:27:25.027
<i>She brought me along, didn't she?</i>

01:27:28.465 --> 01:27:30.831
<i>No. She came by herself, honey.</i>

01:27:34.605 --> 01:27:37.335
<i>Why?</i>

01:27:37.441 --> 01:27:39.341
Why didn't she bring me?

01:27:41.645 --> 01:27:45.342
All I know, Lily,
is she was fallin' apart.

01:27:45.449 --> 01:27:47.349
Depressed people do things
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

01:27:47.451 --> 01:27:50.818
It was easy for her to leave me
'cause she never wanted me in the first place.

01:27:50.921 --> 01:27:52.821
Lily.

01:27:54.892 --> 01:27:57.725
<i>After she was here</i>
<i>for a few months...</i>

01:27:57.828 --> 01:28:01.525
and started feelin' better, she...
she start talkin' about how much she missed you.

01:28:03.467 --> 01:28:05.697
Then she went back
to Sylvan to see you.

01:28:06.803 --> 01:28:09.397
She was just comin' for her things.

01:28:09.506 --> 01:28:13.306
- I believe she came back for you.
- I'm goin' to bed.

01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:14.900
<i>Lily!</i>

01:28:15.012 --> 01:28:18.140
Now your mama
made a terrible mistake.

01:28:18.248 --> 01:28:20.148
But I believe she tried to fix it.

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:22.150
Good night.

01:28:27.257 --> 01:28:30.055
Damn it, Deborah.

01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.898
I hate you!

01:28:45.008 --> 01:28:47.602
I hate your guts!

01:29:06.396 --> 01:29:08.864
Why didn't you love me?

01:30:19.403 --> 01:30:21.303
Tiburon.

01:30:25.075 --> 01:30:26.975
Lily.

01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:33.011
What in Mary's name happened here?

01:30:37.654 --> 01:30:39.554
Answer me.

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:49.521
T. Ray was right about my mother.

01:30:51.768 --> 01:30:53.668
She left me.

01:30:59.576 --> 01:31:02.238
<i>Hi.</i>

01:31:02.346 --> 01:31:04.246
Hi.

01:31:04.348 --> 01:31:07.283
I brought some
of your mama's belongings.

01:31:12.482 --> 01:31:16.680
It's just a handful of things your mama left
when she went back to get you.

01:31:19.522 --> 01:31:21.513
Been in this box...

01:31:22.992 --> 01:31:25.187
10 years, I guess.

01:31:27.564 --> 01:31:29.691
You really loved her.

01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:37.271
It was complicated.
But, yes, I did.

01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:41.275
How was it complicated?

01:31:41.377 --> 01:31:43.709
I was her nanny.

01:31:43.813 --> 01:31:47.044
Things were different
in her world than mine.

01:31:49.752 --> 01:31:53.210
We like to think
that love is pure and limitless.

01:31:53.323 --> 01:31:57.589
But love like that
can't exist in a hateful time.

01:32:00.163 --> 01:32:02.996
But she made me love her anyway.

01:32:05.835 --> 01:32:09.498
There is no perfect love, Lily.

01:32:26.856 --> 01:32:29.188
Your mama's pocket mirror.

01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:35.058
If you look in here,
you see your mama looking back at you.

01:32:56.886 --> 01:32:58.820
Well, I'll be.

01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:08.525
She was wearin' that pin
the day she got here.

01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:27.173
There's just one last thing.

01:34:09.025 --> 01:34:11.516
Hey.

01:34:11.627 --> 01:34:13.595
Hey.

01:34:23.673 --> 01:34:25.766
- What happened to you?
- What about it?

01:34:25.875 --> 01:34:28.241
It changed you, didn't it?

01:34:33.216 --> 01:34:37.585
Sometimes, Lily, l...

01:34:37.687 --> 01:34:39.587
I get so angry.

01:34:40.957 --> 01:34:43.187
I just want to kill somethin'.

01:34:43.292 --> 01:34:46.159
The men that took you...

01:34:46.262 --> 01:34:48.662
they're angry like that too.

01:34:48.765 --> 01:34:50.926
Makes 'em mean.

01:34:53.236 --> 01:34:55.761
You have to promise me, Zach,
that you won't be like them.

01:34:55.872 --> 01:34:58.136
I don't want to.

01:34:58.241 --> 01:35:00.766
Me either.

01:35:26.969 --> 01:35:29.802
No way I'm not
becomin' a lawyer now.

01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:34.769
I'm gonna be one of them drum majors
Dr. King talks about.

01:35:34.877 --> 01:35:37.004
I know you will.

01:35:37.113 --> 01:35:41.982
And... 10, maybe
15 years from now...

01:35:43.252 --> 01:35:45.152
we'll be at your book signin'.

01:36:03.372 --> 01:36:06.466
So don't forget our story, all right?

01:36:08.444 --> 01:36:10.309
I won't.

01:36:21.257 --> 01:36:25.023
<i>I have you know I am now a registered voter.</i>

01:36:25.127 --> 01:36:27.322
- Really?
- I'll be castin' my vote for...

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:29.364
Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey.

01:36:35.004 --> 01:36:37.165
I love you, Miss Rosaleen.

01:36:51.487 --> 01:36:54.217
- Neil.
- Hello, ladies.

01:37:12.508 --> 01:37:14.373
Hi.

01:37:14.477 --> 01:37:17.344
Hi.

01:37:17.446 --> 01:37:21.382
Didn't you call me here to talk?
I'm a little busy.

01:37:21.484 --> 01:37:23.401
You ain't the only one busy.

01:37:23.402 --> 01:37:25.318
I'm just supposed to stand
here and watch how busy you are?

01:37:25.421 --> 01:37:26.752
No.

01:37:34.397 --> 01:37:37.332
I was...

01:37:41.404 --> 01:37:44.271
I was wonderin' if you'd be
willin' to ask again.

01:37:44.373 --> 01:37:46.568
Ask what?

01:37:49.979 --> 01:37:52.072
This supposed to be funny?

01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:04.819
June Boatwright, will you marry me?

01:38:09.699 --> 01:38:11.599
Yes.

01:38:11.701 --> 01:38:13.794
Yes?

01:38:15.071 --> 01:38:16.971
Yes? Yes?

01:38:17.073 --> 01:38:19.701
Yes.

01:38:23.446 --> 01:38:26.540
She said yes.

01:38:26.649 --> 01:38:28.810
- Oh, my God.
- Good for you.

01:38:28.918 --> 01:38:30.909
Come on. We're goin' to
the jewelry store right now...

01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.181
pickin' out a ring before you
change your mind, all right?

01:38:33.289 --> 01:38:35.416
What? You don't already have one?

01:38:35.524 --> 01:38:37.424
Girl, come on.

01:38:37.526 --> 01:38:39.790
How come you don't have one?

01:39:08.224 --> 01:39:11.682
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:16.521
Won't you come in?

01:39:22.838 --> 01:39:25.068
<i>Well, all right, goddamn it.</i>

01:39:25.174 --> 01:39:28.940
<i>You wanna pretend</i>
<i>I'm making a social visit, we'll pretend.</i>

01:39:29.045 --> 01:39:31.843
I'm gonna take you out of here nice and quiet
or kickin' and screamin'.

01:39:31.947 --> 01:39:34.006
<i>Don't matter which one to me.</i>

01:39:34.116 --> 01:39:36.084
Have a seat if you want to.

01:39:49.765 --> 01:39:51.790
So you been here the whole time?

01:39:53.002 --> 01:39:54.902
With colored women?

01:39:55.004 --> 01:39:58.030
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>
- How'd you find me?

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:03.439
That map on your wall.

01:40:03.546 --> 01:40:05.707
Came here, started askin' around.

01:40:05.815 --> 01:40:10.081
Some old lady secretary at the law office
was more than happy to fill me in.

01:40:13.556 --> 01:40:16.889
- Where's Rosaleen?
- She took off a long time ago.

01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:38.710
Where'd you get that?

01:40:38.814 --> 01:40:41.112
- Miss August gave it to me.
- Don't you lie to me.

01:40:42.218 --> 01:40:44.118
I'm not lyin'.

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.654
She said it belonged to my...

01:40:49.892 --> 01:40:53.328
I gave that pin to your mama
on her 22nd birthday.

01:40:55.297 --> 01:40:58.095
Now you tell me right now.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.862
- How'd this August woman get it?
- You gave this to my mother?

01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.938
- Answer me.
- You did?

01:41:05.541 --> 01:41:08.533
This is where my mother came
when she ran away from us.

01:41:09.678 --> 01:41:11.873
She was wearin' it
the day she got here.

01:41:22.758 --> 01:41:25.852
Miss August used to take care of her
when she was a little girl.

01:41:36.105 --> 01:41:38.835
I looked for her
everywhere I could think.

01:41:40.943 --> 01:41:42.877
And she was right here.

01:41:44.413 --> 01:41:46.881
Jesus Christ, she was right here.

01:41:59.428 --> 01:42:02.261
Goddamn you, Deborah!

01:42:02.364 --> 01:42:04.229
You ain't leavin' me again!

01:42:04.333 --> 01:42:06.198
Get back here!

01:42:06.302 --> 01:42:08.497
T. Ray, it's me, Lily!

01:42:08.604 --> 01:42:10.595
Daddy!

01:42:26.088 --> 01:42:29.148
You... You look like her.

01:42:37.466 --> 01:42:40.731
My whole life's
been nothin' but a hole...

01:42:40.836 --> 01:42:43.669
where my mother should've been.

01:42:43.772 --> 01:42:45.967
It left me always achin'.

01:42:48.077 --> 01:42:50.272
But I never thought about
what it did to you.

01:42:59.355 --> 01:43:01.949
- We're goin' home.
- I'm stayin' here.

01:43:05.227 --> 01:43:07.991
<i>You think I'm gonna</i>
<i>walk out of here and leave you?</i>

01:43:08.097 --> 01:43:10.088
I don't even know these damn people.

01:43:10.199 --> 01:43:12.099
I know them.

01:43:13.269 --> 01:43:15.396
And August Boatwright
is a good person.

01:43:15.504 --> 01:43:18.234
<i>Now, what makes you think</i>
<i>she'd even want you here?</i>

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.571
Lily can have a home here
as long as she wants.

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:26.845
Lily said you'd run off.

01:43:26.949 --> 01:43:29.349
Well, I guess I'm back now.

01:43:29.451 --> 01:43:33.911
<i>Well, I don't really care</i>
<i>where you end up...</i>

01:43:35.124 --> 01:43:37.058
but Lily's comin' with me.

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.000
Everybody all right?

01:43:48.570 --> 01:43:50.538
We all right.

01:43:50.639 --> 01:43:52.664
This is Mr. Owens...

01:43:52.775 --> 01:43:54.675
Lily's father.

01:43:54.777 --> 01:43:57.268
He came here for a visit.

01:44:00.449 --> 01:44:02.849
<i>Mr. Owens...</i>

01:44:02.951 --> 01:44:07.888
you'd be doing Lily and us
a big favor by leavin' her here.

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:11.949
I made her my apprentice beekeeper.
She learnin' the whole business.

01:44:14.997 --> 01:44:16.862
We love Lily.

01:44:18.634 --> 01:44:21.535
<i>We'll get her started in school.</i>

01:44:21.637 --> 01:44:24.970
We'll take care of her.
I promise you that.

01:44:34.083 --> 01:44:36.142
Well...

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.420
good riddance.

01:45:09.218 --> 01:45:11.914
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

01:45:16.792 --> 01:45:20.728
The day my mother died, you said
she was only comin' back for her things.

01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:24.258
Is that true?

01:45:27.102 --> 01:45:29.002
No.

01:45:30.439 --> 01:45:32.964
No. She was comin' for you.

01:45:36.845 --> 01:45:38.938
Why did you lie?

01:45:42.317 --> 01:45:44.512
'Cause she didn't come for me.

01:46:20.389 --> 01:46:24.382
<i> I still tell myself</i>
<i>that when T. Ray drove away that day...</i>

01:46:24.493 --> 01:46:27.621
<i>he wasn't sayin: "Good riddance."</i>

01:46:27.729 --> 01:46:32.826
<i>He was sayin: "Lily, you are better off there</i>
<i>with all these mothers. "</i>

01:46:34.203 --> 01:46:38.469
<i>I have more mothers than</i>
<i>any three girls off the street.</i>

01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:41.970
<i>They are the moons</i>
<i>shinin' over me.</i>

01:46:48.016 --> 01:46:50.246
<i>I guess I have forgiven myself.</i>

01:46:50.352 --> 01:46:55.153
<i>Although sometimes in the night,</i>
<i>my dreams will take me back to sadness...</i>

01:46:55.257 --> 01:46:59.057
<i>and I have to wake up and forgive again.</i>

01:46:59.161 --> 01:47:02.187
<i>But Mary is always there.</i>

01:47:03.665 --> 01:47:06.133
<i>I feel her at unexpected moments.</i>

01:47:07.503 --> 01:47:09.698
<i>She will suddenly rise.</i>

01:47:09.805 --> 01:47:14.640
<i>And when she does,</i>
<i>she does not go up into the sky...</i>

01:47:14.743 --> 01:47:17.109
<i>but further inside of me.</i>

01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:19.930
<i>If you think</i>
<i>the sky is falling</i>

01:48:20.042 --> 01:48:23.136
<i>Comin' undone</i>

01:48:23.245 --> 01:48:24.803
<i>Hmm</i>

01:48:24.913 --> 01:48:29.373
<i>All the pieces crumble</i>

01:48:29.484 --> 01:48:32.120
<i>You're on the run</i>

01:48:34.356 --> 01:48:38.986
<i>All the wrong you've taken</i>

01:48:39.094 --> 01:48:43.656
<i>All the rules</i>
<i>you're breakin'</i>

01:48:43.765 --> 01:48:48.168
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the solid truth is</i>

01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:50.704
<i>It comes back to you</i>

01:48:50.806 --> 01:48:55.436
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:48:55.544 --> 01:49:00.174
<i>Can't you see the sun</i>
<i>is breakin' through</i>

01:49:00.282 --> 01:49:04.776
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

01:49:04.886 --> 01:49:10.324
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:49:10.425 --> 01:49:11.915
<i>Huh</i>

01:49:12.027 --> 01:49:16.589
<i>Every time you</i>
<i>walk out that door</i>

01:49:16.698 --> 01:49:19.895
<i>Cursin' the sky</i>

01:49:21.336 --> 01:49:25.966
<i>Feelin' like</i>
<i>you've been cheated</i>

01:49:26.074 --> 01:49:28.406
<i>Ripped from inside</i>

01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:33.106
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:49:33.215 --> 01:49:37.845
<i>Can't you see the sun</i>
<i>is breakin' through</i>

01:49:37.953 --> 01:49:42.583
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

01:49:42.691 --> 01:49:47.651
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:49:47.763 --> 01:49:49.958
<i>Come on</i>

01:49:50.065 --> 01:49:51.760
<i>Mmm</i>

01:49:51.867 --> 01:49:53.767
<i>Mmm</i>

01:49:56.505 --> 01:49:58.405
<i>Mmm, yeah</i>

01:50:00.976 --> 01:50:03.570
<i>Now you know</i>

01:50:03.679 --> 01:50:05.146
<i>Hmm</i>

01:50:12.854 --> 01:50:14.754
<i>Uh</i>

01:50:14.856 --> 01:50:18.189
<i>Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah</i>

<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:50:55.564 --> 01:50:59.864
<i>Don't you know the sky is blue</i>

01:50:59.968 --> 01:51:04.837
<i>Have</i> a...
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.138
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

01:51:09.244 --> 01:51:12.441
<i>Don't you know the sky is blue</i>

01:51:12.547 --> 01:51:14.014
<i>Hey</i>

01:51:14.116 --> 01:51:17.142
<i>Don't you know the sky</i>

01:51:17.252 --> 01:51:19.152
<i>Sky</i>

01:51:19.254 --> 01:51:21.552
<i>I'm telling you</i>

01:51:21.656 --> 01:51:23.783
<i>The sky is blue</i>

01:51:23.892 --> 01:51:27.760
<i>Believe it whoo-hoo</i>

01:51:27.863 --> 01:51:30.354
<i>Don't you know the sky</i>

01:51:30.465 --> 01:51:32.057
<i>Sky</i>

01:51:32.167 --> 01:51:33.725
<i>Sky</i>

01:51:33.835 --> 01:51:36.633
<i>Sky</i>

01:51:36.738 --> 01:51:38.638
<i>Hey</i>

01:51:47.215 --> 01:51:50.582
<i>Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah</i>

<i>Oh</i>

<i>Oh</i>

01:52:00.762 --> 01:52:03.458
<i>Oh</i>

01:52:03.565 --> 01:52:05.533
<i>Well, there's nothin'</i>
<i>you can do</i>

01:52:05.634 --> 01:52:08.068
<i>Well, there's nothin'</i>
<i>you can say</i>

01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:11.435
<i>'Cause everything just ain't</i>
<i>gonna go your way</i>

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.440
<i>If you're feeling</i>
<i>kind of strange</i>

01:52:13.542 --> 01:52:15.942
<i>And you want to lay it down</i>

01:52:16.044 --> 01:52:19.013
<i>And it's hard for you to keep</i>
<i>your feet on solid ground</i>

01:52:19.114 --> 01:52:22.572

<i>When a poor girl shine</i>

01:52:49.678 --> 01:52:52.044
<i>And a rich girl cries</i>

01:52:52.147 --> 01:52:55.378
<i>And the clown is</i>
<i>wearin'no makeup</i>

01:52:55.483 --> 01:52:57.417
