WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:06.238
Ok, listen up, people.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.806
Today in health class,

00:07.808 --> 00:09.575
we begin an important lesson...

00:09.577 --> 00:10.776
responsibility.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.044
A sack of flour?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.679
A bundle of joy.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.514
Right. Joy. What?!

00:15.516 --> 00:17.850
Yes! It's
a baby lesson.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.020
We have to treat the sack
like it's a newborn infant.

00:21.022 --> 00:24.957
Ok, what does schlepping a bag of
flour around have to do with health?

00:24.959 --> 00:27.026
Well, for starters, Stoppable,

00:27.028 --> 00:28.927
if anything happens
to your bag,

00:28.929 --> 00:32.264
it would be unhealthy
for your grade.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.833
For the next week,
you will be tasked

00:34.835 --> 00:38.103
with this 10-pound sack of
stone ground Minnesota wheat.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.539
Treat it like
your own flesh and blood.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.741
Yeah. Why don't they use,
like, you know, rump roast?

00:42.743 --> 00:44.777
Wouldn't that be more
authentically fleshy?

00:44.779 --> 00:49.681
Ew! Gross. Maybe you
need to visualize.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.085
Barkin: You will see to your
crushing parenting burden

00:53.087 --> 00:56.221
with patience, tenderness,
and love.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.892
Oh, yeah.
How do you love a...

01:02.095 --> 01:04.129
she has my eyes.

01:04.964 --> 01:09.868
Kim, I know I'm biased,
but isn't she beautiful?

01:09.870 --> 01:15.207
Aren't you a little old
for the flour assignment?

01:15.209 --> 01:16.909
Bonding time, Kim.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.044
Don't kiss me in front
of little sackie.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.245
Sackie?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.947
[Sniffs]

01:21.949 --> 01:23.282
Mm! Yum.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.783
Whoa. Hey.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.051
Hey. Did you disinfect?

01:26.053 --> 01:29.955
Ok, for the next 7 days,
sackie is

01:29.957 --> 01:31.323
my number-one priority.

01:31.325 --> 01:36.128
Ok, now you've seriously
taken the deep leap.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.197
You turned your bedroom
into a nursery?

01:38.199 --> 01:41.900
Wait. When did you turn
your bedroom into a nursery?

01:41.902 --> 01:44.903
I didn't. Wait. Why
is my room a nursery?

01:44.905 --> 01:50.042
Our family has adopted
a precious little girl.

01:51.077 --> 01:52.377
We... you... I...

01:52.379 --> 01:54.246
wait. Why didn't
you tell me?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.215
This is our way of telling you.

your new baby sister...

about being an only child.

fully over change.

his own sitch right now.

so little time.

do I have to say it?

You have to give me
another flour baby.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.126
You blew the assignment already?

04:21.128 --> 04:25.430
To be fair, it wasn't
entirely Ron's fault.

There were extenuating

always have to use monkey ninjas?

wisdom, and happiness.

to find the traps for me?

10:33.667 --> 10:37.135
I have no intention
of interrupting.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.839
Please do carry on.

Aah!

11:11.837 --> 11:14.239
[Imitating fanfare]

11:14.840 --> 11:17.642
Way to go, Rufus!

11:18.844 --> 11:21.713
Uh, a lot of help here.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.814
Be right there.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.784
If you would please
duck, Stoppable-San.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.653
Your head blocks the
creature's stress point.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.288
Sorry.

11:35.728 --> 11:39.497
Thanks, yori.
You're the best.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.569
Whoa!

11:46.906 --> 11:49.274
Only the red section
of the scroll remains.

11:49.276 --> 11:53.645
If monkey fist gains the final
key, the weapon is his.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.280
I'll have Wade start a search

11:55.282 --> 11:56.815
for the next stop
on the shrine tour.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.884
Meantime, Ron and I might
as well head home.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.986
Ha ha ha.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.421
[Baby talk]

12:03.423 --> 12:05.690
Kim, where are you going?

12:05.692 --> 12:10.395
Come on, Ron. Don't you want
a little peek at the cutie?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.565
And play right into
the intruder's plan?

12:13.567 --> 12:14.799
Thank you, no.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.936
I'm afraid Ron
isn't coming around.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.704
Oh, Ronnie just needs
a little time.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.674
Now, get over here for a
little fawning over Hana.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.542
It's good for
the soul, you know?

12:24.544 --> 12:25.944
Hee hee!

12:25.946 --> 12:27.412
Aw! Aw! Aw!

12:27.414 --> 12:30.615
Oh, sackie, you're such
a cutie baby.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.751
Yes, you know you are,
don't you?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.919
See, Ron, you'll make
a great big brother,

12:34.921 --> 12:38.289
but you'd get more out of it if
you were cooing over your sister

12:38.291 --> 12:39.991
instead of a bag of...
hold on.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.928
There's no way Barkin would ever
have given you sackie "V"...

12:43.930 --> 12:46.431
oh, well, actually,
this is sackie...

12:46.433 --> 12:48.032

12:48.034 --> 12:50.535
[Crash]

12:50.537 --> 12:53.905
Whoa!

12:54.940 --> 12:59.811
Sackie 8? Just how many
sackies are there?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.581
Well, but I won't need any of them.
Honest.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.818
Sackie viii is going to be
perfectly safe in these hands.

13:06.820 --> 13:11.322
Dad: Ronald, did you see the
new ceiling fan I put in?

13:13.492 --> 13:17.729
Sackie 8, we hardly knew ye.

13:21.801 --> 13:26.604
The second clue, loving the
weapon makes it unstoppable.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.007
Excellent.
I love it already.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.041
Look out!

13:30.043 --> 13:32.677
[Monkeys chattering]

13:35.648 --> 13:37.615
That's what I get for letting

13:37.617 --> 13:39.751
the monkey drive my new boat.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.786
Come to papa, sackie...

13:41.788 --> 13:44.055
Number 10? You know
you're gonna get

13:44.057 --> 13:48.993
no bustage. I made sure to get
the exact same brand of flour

13:48.995 --> 13:52.697
what Barkin doesn't know,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.867
Who knew my B.F. Had
such a nefarious streak?

13:55.869 --> 13:58.436
I think you meant
such the responsible streak,

13:58.438 --> 13:59.804
didn't you, Kimmy?

13:59.806 --> 14:01.606
[Nervously] Uh, yeah, sure.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.908
Great, because our
Ron "sponsible"

14:03.910 --> 14:06.344
is recruited
for baby-sitter duty.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.979
What? Wait. No!

14:07.981 --> 14:09.914
Don't worry, Ronnie.
If you get in a pickle,

14:09.916 --> 14:11.716
I left a parenting
book in the kitchen.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.984
"What to expect when
you're panicking."

14:12.986 --> 14:15.854
They cannot be leaving me
alone with the intruder!

14:15.856 --> 14:16.855
This is not cool!

14:16.857 --> 14:18.990
You're not alone.
I'm...

14:18.992 --> 14:19.958
[beeping]

14:19.960 --> 14:25.897
Oh, great. Ok, I'll meet yori
there, and Kim can baby-sit.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.465
You and yori?

14:27.467 --> 14:32.003
Well, Rufus, guess
it's just you and me

14:32.005 --> 14:34.505
and sackie "X," of course.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.875
[Rufus and baby giggling]

14:37.509 --> 14:40.912
I cannot believe I have
to miss the mission

because of you.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.481
[Baby talk]

14:43.483 --> 14:44.949
Yeah, yuk it up, intruder.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.517
But you won't be laughing

14:46.519 --> 14:47.886
after sackie proves
her superiority

14:47.888 --> 14:51.155
in the first annual ultimate
infant championship.

14:51.157 --> 14:56.628
Event number one...

most motionless baby.

least violent baby.

a giggler, aren't you?

Yeah, well, you know, even
evil can be cute sometimes.

baby-sitting his sister.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.080
Then it is... how you say...
girls' night out.

15:49.082 --> 15:53.885
This time, we must not become
a pawn of the monkey man.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.020
How disappointing.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.956
[Monkeys chattering]

15:59.158 --> 16:02.994
It's just no fun when the
good guys don't play along.

16:02.996 --> 16:08.499
So I suppose I'll simply
have to make you play.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.872
As the blue shrine was
guarded by stone,

16:14.874 --> 16:18.676
the red shrine
is guarded by lava.

Ooh, sounds dangerous.

Always the gentleman.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.987
You just worry about
springing the traps

16:28.989 --> 16:31.255
so I can safely
secure the red key

16:31.257 --> 16:34.892
and with it finally
reveal the true nature

16:34.894 --> 16:37.695
of the secret weapon.

Huh. Mock me at
your peril, intruder.

is not gonna change my mind.

always impressed

do anything useful with it.

but all I got was this.

Wade: Exactly. I know you're
on baby-sitter patrol, but...

found out

the sister of Ron Stoppable.

Who needs...

17:33.853 --> 17:35.720
Don't ask.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.923
Since we're stuck in here,

17:38.925 --> 17:41.926
we might as well try
to get the red key.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.797
The shrine's safeguard will
attempt to bar our way.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.565
Then we'll have to be smarter

17:47.567 --> 17:49.734
than both the shrine
and monkey boy.

Together, then.

they went in first.
