03:14.067 --> 03:15.652
<i>I have decided to keep a journal.</i>

03:16.361 --> 03:19.739
<i>Not in a word program or digital file
but in longhand,</i>

03:20.699 --> 03:23.910
<i>writing every word out
so that every inflection of penmanship,</i>

03:24.244 --> 03:27.914
<i>every word chosen, scratched out,
revised, is recorded.</i>

03:29.332 --> 03:31.542
<i>To set down all my thoughts
and the simple events</i>

03:31.625 --> 03:34.086
<i>of my day factually
and without hiding anything.</i>

03:36.255 --> 03:39.049
<i>When writing about oneself,
one should show no mercy.</i>

03:40.801 --> 03:44.179
<i>I will keep this diary
for one year, 12 months</i>

03:45.013 --> 03:47.641
<i>and at the end of that time,
it will be destroyed.</i>

03:48.183 --> 03:51.854
<i>Shredded, then burnt.
The experiment will be over.</i>

04:10.496 --> 04:11.581
Please rise.

04:16.961 --> 04:20.089
What is thy only comfort in life and death?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.258
That I, with body and soul

04:22.341 --> 04:25.595
both in life and death, am not my own

04:25.803 --> 04:29.849
but belong unto
my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.

04:29.932 --> 04:31.726
Who with his precious blood...

04:31.809 --> 04:34.728
<i>These thoughts and recollections are
not so different from those I confide</i>

04:34.811 --> 04:35.812
<i>to God every morning.</i>

04:38.315 --> 04:39.232
<i>When it is possible.</i>

04:40.108 --> 04:41.151
<i>When he is listening.</i>

04:46.490 --> 04:48.825
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.584
The bread of life. The cup of salvation.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.964
The bread of life. The cup of salvation.

05:03.048 --> 05:04.966
<i>This journal is a form of speaking...</i>

05:06.383 --> 05:09.303
<i>of communication from one to the other.</i>

05:10.179 --> 05:12.306
<i>A communication which can be achieved simply</i>

05:13.140 --> 05:15.726
<i>and in repose without
prostration or abnegation.</i>

05:18.604 --> 05:19.730
<i>It is a form of prayer.</i>

05:21.106 --> 05:23.692
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.

05:33.828 --> 05:36.330
There is a leak in the men's restroom.

05:36.413 --> 05:37.330
No, I fixed it.

05:37.413 --> 05:41.793
No. I was just there. It's still leaking.
Same place. Under the hot faucet.

05:41.876 --> 05:44.462
- What about the women's room?
- The women's is fine.

05:44.796 --> 05:46.506
Do you want me to call
the plumber from Abundant Life?

05:46.589 --> 05:47.966
No, let me have another crack at it.

05:48.049 --> 05:50.301
I hate always bugging them
for extra little costs.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.095
They don't mind.
That's what they're there for.

05:52.178 --> 05:54.806
- And you're totally within your budget.
- Still, I don't want to.

05:56.391 --> 05:57.433
Have you posted the sermon?

05:57.892 --> 05:59.644
Yes. I did it this morning.

06:01.437 --> 06:02.355
- Oh...
- Reverend?

06:02.438 --> 06:04.482
Yes, Mary, right?

06:04.566 --> 06:06.860
- Mary Mensana.
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

06:07.193 --> 06:09.111
I wanted to talk, if that's okay.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on in, Mary.

06:10.654 --> 06:13.365
- I'll be right back.
- Mary, how can I help you?

06:13.448 --> 06:14.533
I was wondering if you would talk

06:14.616 --> 06:16.368
- to my husband, Michael.
- Oh, sure. I...

06:16.451 --> 06:18.287
Actually, not now.
He has to... he has to go to work.

06:18.370 --> 06:19.705
He has to fill in at Home Depot.

06:22.541 --> 06:23.458
Mary?

06:25.085 --> 06:27.129
- What is it?
- I'm worried about him.

06:27.838 --> 06:29.673
He's involved in the Green Planet movement.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.425
- It's an activist group.
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.508 --> 06:33.260
And he was in jail in Canada.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.387
And he just got out two weeks ago.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.640
He just sits around at home.
He doesn't... he doesn't go out.

06:38.724 --> 06:42.476
I got him to fill out a temp form
for Home... for Home Depot.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.145
- Okay.
- So that's good.

06:44.228 --> 06:45.938
Are you sure you don't want
to go to Abundant Life?

06:46.022 --> 06:47.857
They have a whole team
of counselors over there,

06:47.940 --> 06:49.859
- who are trained and...
- I know, but he doesn't want to.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.777
He thinks it's more
of a company than a church.

06:52.153 --> 06:54.071
And so, he said he would talk to you.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.199
Uh, all right.

06:58.284 --> 06:59.201
Tomorrow?

07:00.077 --> 07:01.621
- After lunch?
- Great. Great.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.789
I'll just need the... I just need an address.

07:04.415 --> 07:05.666
And can you tell me a little more?

07:06.876 --> 07:09.879
Oh, he applied for compassionate release
when he found out.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.964
He was at Fort Providence.
They let him out early.

07:12.048 --> 07:14.966
- Wait, now, found out what?
- That I was pregnant.

07:15.050 --> 07:18.178
Oh. Hmm, congratulations.

07:18.887 --> 07:19.804
Thanks.

07:21.398 --> 07:24.734
He thinks it's wrong to bring
a child into this world.

07:28.196 --> 07:30.490
He wants to kill our baby.

07:35.787 --> 07:38.373
<i>I assisted Sunday the youth group
at Abundant Life.</i>

07:38.832 --> 07:41.501
<i>The young people were
so excited, so full of life.</i>

07:41.918 --> 07:43.878
<i>They were open. They welcomed communion.</i>

07:48.298 --> 07:50.592
<i>Maybe I shouldn't care about
whether people like me.</i>

07:52.651 --> 07:54.653
<i>Did Jesus worry about being liked?</i>

07:58.824 --> 08:01.201
<i>I look at the last lines
I wrote with disdain.</i>

08:05.038 --> 08:05.956
<i>Twelve months.</i>

08:07.249 --> 08:09.209
<i>Can I keep up an exercise that long?</i>

08:23.723 --> 08:26.517
<i>When I read these words,
I see not truth, but pride.</i>

08:32.732 --> 08:34.442
<i>I wish I had not used the word pride.</i>

08:35.735 --> 08:37.193
<i>But I cannot cross it out.</i>

08:42.658 --> 08:44.118
<i>If only I could pray.</i>

09:41.358 --> 09:42.275
Hi, Reverend.

09:42.359 --> 09:45.820
- Hi. Is Michael home?
- Yeah. Come on in.

09:45.904 --> 09:46.988
Okay. Yeah.

09:51.117 --> 09:53.243
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

09:53.786 --> 09:55.496
Um, would you like some coffee?

09:56.372 --> 09:59.375
- Yes, but, um...
- We're... I think we have some tea.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.584
Yes. That would be better.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.585
- Okay.
- Thanks.

10:04.588 --> 10:06.090
Let me take your coat?

10:06.924 --> 10:08.300
No, it's okay. I got it.

10:09.426 --> 10:10.344
Come on in.

10:15.766 --> 10:18.811
- Yeah, I don't know why Mary...
- There's no need to apologize.

10:19.144 --> 10:21.855
No, she told me
that you've been up in Canada.

10:22.898 --> 10:25.942
Yeah. Fort Providence.

10:26.943 --> 10:30.071
It's in the Mackenzie Delta.
It's way in the north.

10:30.154 --> 10:31.823
Yeah, beautiful country, I imagine.

10:31.906 --> 10:33.116
Yeah, it is.

10:37.328 --> 10:38.830
Mary said things have been getting you down?

10:41.624 --> 10:45.545
Uh, yeah, things.
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.339
Oh! Thank you very much.

10:49.007 --> 10:50.049
- It's hot.
- Perfect.

10:51.175 --> 10:52.093
Thank you.

11:01.810 --> 11:03.729
- So Mary is pregnant.
- Hmm.

11:04.479 --> 11:08.358
- Yeah. How far along is she?
- Twenty weeks.

11:08.692 --> 11:10.110
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

11:18.702 --> 11:21.329
Hey, how old are you, Reverend?

11:23.832 --> 11:24.750
I'm 46.

11:28.586 --> 11:29.879
Uh, 33.

11:31.797 --> 11:34.925
That's how old our child will be in 2050.

11:35.009 --> 11:36.594
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:36.677 --> 11:39.388
You know, that's
two years older than I am right now.

11:39.472 --> 11:40.514
Mm-hmm.

11:41.974 --> 11:44.351
- You'll be 81.
- Yeah!

11:45.269 --> 11:49.315
Hey, you know what the world
will be like in 2050?

11:49.398 --> 11:52.193
- Hmm. Hard to imagine.
- Yeah, you think?

11:53.778 --> 11:59.491
I mean, Reverend,
the world is changing so fast.

12:00.617 --> 12:01.701
And right in front of us.

12:01.785 --> 12:06.331
I mean, one-third of the natural world
has been destroyed in your lifetime.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.377
You know, the earth's temperature
will be three degrees centigrade higher.

12:12.378 --> 12:13.671
Four is the threshold.

12:15.048 --> 12:19.010
You know, "Severe, widespread,
and irreversible impacts."

12:19.094 --> 12:23.014
And when scientists say
stuff like that, you know?

12:23.098 --> 12:25.517
And National Center
for Atmospheric Research...

12:27.852 --> 12:31.063
Lawrence Livermore,
Potsdam Institute. Reverend...

12:31.146 --> 12:32.856
<i>He went on like that for some time.</i>

12:33.649 --> 12:36.902
<i>By 2050, sea levels two feet
higher on the East Coast.</i>

12:37.361 --> 12:40.030
<i>Low lying areas underwater across the world.</i>

12:40.280 --> 12:42.783
<i>Bangladesh, 20% loss of landmass.</i>

12:42.866 --> 12:46.036
<i>Central Africa, 50% reduction
in crops due to drought.</i>

12:46.411 --> 12:48.038
<i>The Western reservoirs dried up.</i>

12:48.122 --> 12:51.208
<i>Climate change. Refugees.
Epidemics. Extreme weather.</i>

12:51.667 --> 12:52.709
You know, the...

12:54.419 --> 12:56.338
the bad times, they will begin,

12:56.421 --> 12:58.549
and from that point,
everything moves very quickly.

13:00.467 --> 13:05.012
You know, this social structure
can't bear the stress of multiple crises.

13:06.430 --> 13:09.976
Opportunistic diseases, anarchy,
martial law, the tipping point.

13:10.059 --> 13:12.061
And this isn't in some, like, distant future.

13:12.145 --> 13:13.437
You will live to see this.

13:14.355 --> 13:18.526
You know, my children
will experience this un-livability.

13:18.609 --> 13:19.735
This, uh...

13:20.528 --> 13:22.321
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just... you know, I...

13:23.322 --> 13:25.241
I thought things could change, you know?

13:25.324 --> 13:27.118
I thought... I thought people would listen.

13:27.869 --> 13:29.245
Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?

13:31.914 --> 13:32.832
No.

13:34.082 --> 13:36.126
Why? Did Mary say something like that?

13:36.209 --> 13:37.127
No, no.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.296
No, I'm not worried for myself.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.758
I just... this world is gonna be what it is.

13:45.051 --> 13:46.970
- But can I ask you a question, Reverend?
- Mm-hmm.

13:49.139 --> 13:51.975
How do you sanction
bringing in a little girl...

13:52.684 --> 13:56.188
Uh, for argument's sake,
let's just say that, uh...

13:56.646 --> 13:59.733
Mary and I's child, it's a little girl.

14:05.030 --> 14:07.364
You know, a child that's so full of hope...

14:09.241 --> 14:13.829
and naive beliefs into a world
where that little girl, uh...

14:15.789 --> 14:19.668
she grows up to be a young woman
and she looks you in the eyes

14:19.752 --> 14:22.630
and she says that you knew
this all along, didn't you?

14:27.468 --> 14:28.385
You see, that...

14:30.638 --> 14:33.140
I mean, what are you supposed to say then?

14:36.602 --> 14:38.478
There's something growing inside Mary.

14:39.145 --> 14:43.691
Something as alive as a tree, surely.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.152
As an endangered species.

14:47.278 --> 14:51.491
Something full of the beauty
and mystery of nature.

14:54.077 --> 14:56.996
You said sanction, hmm?

14:58.539 --> 15:00.083
You think Mary should have an abortion?

15:00.792 --> 15:02.293
This birth, is that your right?

15:02.377 --> 15:03.419
Is that your decision?

15:03.878 --> 15:05.463
Have you asked Mary what she thinks?

15:11.760 --> 15:15.639
Look, this isn't... it's not about your baby.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.641
It's not about Mary.

15:19.893 --> 15:21.103
It's about you...

15:22.437 --> 15:24.648
and your despair. Your lack of hope.

15:26.275 --> 15:28.652
Look, people have throughout history

15:28.735 --> 15:32.739
have woken up in the dead of the night
confronted by blackness.

15:33.282 --> 15:35.409
The sense that our lives are without meaning.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.495
<i>The Sickness Unto Death.</i>

15:38.578 --> 15:40.247
Yeah, but this is something different.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.164
Yeah, no, man's great achievements

15:42.248 --> 15:45.918
have brought him to the place
where life as we know it

15:46.002 --> 15:47.753
may cease in the foreseeable future.

15:47.837 --> 15:48.879
Yes, that's new.

15:50.131 --> 15:51.090
But the blackness?

15:53.759 --> 15:54.677
That's not.

15:55.011 --> 15:57.013
We're scientific people.
We want to solve things.

15:57.096 --> 15:58.764
We want rational answers.

15:59.181 --> 16:03.394
Right? And if humankind can't overcome

16:03.477 --> 16:06.939
its immediate interests enough to ensure
its own survival, then you're right.

16:07.023 --> 16:09.442
The only rational response is despair.

16:11.068 --> 16:15.113
But do you think that
there's any existence apart from this?

16:15.947 --> 16:17.407
This here, right now?

16:17.490 --> 16:18.825
- Yes.
- Yeah, right, before us.

16:18.908 --> 16:19.826
- After us.
- Yeah.

16:19.909 --> 16:21.911
- Yeah,
- Wait, so you're talking about

16:21.995 --> 16:23.288
the next lifetime? Huh?

16:23.788 --> 16:24.831
You really... you just, uh...

16:24.914 --> 16:28.043
<i>I felt like I was Jacob wrestling
all night long with the angel.</i>

16:28.835 --> 16:30.045
<i>Fighting in the grasp.</i>

16:31.296 --> 16:34.883
<i>Every sentence, every question,
every response, a mortal struggle.</i>

16:35.967 --> 16:37.260
<i>It was exhilarating.</i>

16:38.011 --> 16:39.804
You believe in martyrdom, Reverend?

16:39.888 --> 16:41.222
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

16:41.306 --> 16:42.724
You know, the Saints of God?

16:43.141 --> 16:46.018
The early Christians
who wouldn't renounce their faith?

16:46.518 --> 16:49.313
The missionaries who were attacked
in the fields of the Lord.

16:49.396 --> 16:51.273
Do you believe that they died for a purpose?

16:51.357 --> 16:53.067
- I do.
- Well, every week,

16:53.150 --> 16:56.653
activists are killed
trying to protect the environment.

16:58.530 --> 17:01.700
A hundred and seventeen were
killed last year for their beliefs.

17:04.036 --> 17:05.162
I mean, right there.

17:05.244 --> 17:08.207
This is JosÃ© ClÃ¡udio Ribeiro da Silva.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.794
Huh? And that's his wife, Maria.

17:14.213 --> 17:19.800
Uh... they were... they were gunned down
in 2011 in the Amazon.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.880
You know, they were protesting
free cutting of the rain forest.

17:25.765 --> 17:29.852
Hey, this is Dorothy Stang, 2005.

17:29.936 --> 17:32.814
She was a nun from Ohio.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.610
And what was the purpose of their death?

17:45.201 --> 17:48.870
You know, in 2010, the IPCC predicted

17:48.954 --> 17:52.165
that if drastic action wasn't taken by 2015,

17:53.667 --> 17:55.836
environmental collapse would be irreversible.

17:57.045 --> 17:58.130
And nothing was done.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.385
And now it's 2017.

18:04.636 --> 18:07.389
You said you respected me.
What I've been through.

18:09.766 --> 18:14.604
- Yes.
- So you know my story, hmm?

18:15.188 --> 18:16.982
- Yeah, you were a chaplain.
- Uh-huh.

18:17.607 --> 18:21.444
My father taught at VMI.
I encouraged my son to enlist.

18:21.527 --> 18:22.945
It was the family tradition.

18:23.988 --> 18:28.325
Like his father, my father before me, hmm.

18:28.409 --> 18:29.910
A patriotic tradition.

18:33.664 --> 18:36.834
My wife... was very opposed.

18:37.877 --> 18:39.295
My son enlisted anyway.

18:39.795 --> 18:42.840
And six months later, he was dead in Iraq.

18:43.257 --> 18:49.555
Right? I talked my son into a war
that had no moral justification.

18:52.307 --> 18:53.975
My wife could no longer live with me.

18:55.018 --> 18:56.102
I left the military.

18:57.896 --> 18:58.813
I was lost.

19:01.691 --> 19:04.027
And Reverend Jeffers from Abundant Life,

19:04.110 --> 19:08.031
he gave me this position
at First Reformed and here I am.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.533
And Michael, I can promise you...

19:11.951 --> 19:16.956
that whatever despair you feel
about bringing a child into this world

19:17.540 --> 19:21.836
cannot equal the despair
of taking a child from it.

19:34.223 --> 19:36.058
Hey, what was his name?

19:37.267 --> 19:38.185
Your son?

19:40.729 --> 19:41.647
Joseph.

19:43.690 --> 19:44.650
The boy thrown down the well.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.652
- Yeah, I remember.
- Mm-hmm.

19:46.735 --> 19:49.363
- The dreamer.
- The dreamer, yeah. Yeah.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.993
And you were able to just go on?

19:57.161 --> 20:00.998
Courage... is the solution to despair.

20:01.332 --> 20:05.044
Reason... provides no answers.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.090
I can't know what the future will bring.

20:09.173 --> 20:11.926
We have to choose despite uncertainty.

20:13.177 --> 20:19.892
Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths
in our mind, simultaneously.

20:21.060 --> 20:22.895
Hope and despair.

20:22.979 --> 20:25.189
A life without despair
is a life without hope.

20:25.273 --> 20:28.942
Holding these two ideas
in our head is life itself.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.750
Are you a drinking man, Reverend?

20:47.002 --> 20:49.963
- It doesn't help.
- No, I suppose not.

20:57.887 --> 20:59.055
Can God forgive us?

21:04.018 --> 21:05.769
For what we've done to this world?

21:08.230 --> 21:09.231
I don't know.

21:11.942 --> 21:13.402
Who can know the mind of God?

21:15.904 --> 21:16.864
But we can choose...

21:19.700 --> 21:20.743
a righteous life.

21:22.077 --> 21:23.078
Belief.

21:24.163 --> 21:25.331
Forgiveness.

21:27.499 --> 21:29.877
Grace covers us all.

21:32.754 --> 21:33.838
I believe that.

21:42.805 --> 21:44.515
Let's meet again.

21:44.974 --> 21:45.892
Want to?

21:46.559 --> 21:48.436
Tomorrow after lunch, same time.

21:49.437 --> 21:51.356
Okay, yeah. It's a... it's a plan.

21:55.318 --> 21:58.446
<i>I went over everything that was said,
what should have been said,</i>

21:58.529 --> 22:00.323
<i>what could have been said differently,</i>

22:00.406 --> 22:01.783
<i>what could have been said better.</i>

22:03.784 --> 22:07.329
<i>"I know that nothing can change
and I know there is no hope."</i>

22:08.914 --> 22:10.207
<i>Thomas Merton wrote this.</i>

22:13.460 --> 22:16.338
<i>"Despair is a development of pride so great</i>

22:16.421 --> 22:18.465
<i>that it chooses one's certitude</i>

22:18.548 --> 22:22.010
<i>rather than admit God
is more creative than we are."</i>

22:23.553 --> 22:25.472
<i>Perhaps it's better I didn't say that to him.</i>

23:04.176 --> 23:05.970
<i>Who am I to talk about pride?</i>

23:26.156 --> 23:30.577
Well, to begin, the church
was constructed in 1767

23:30.660 --> 23:32.537
in a style we now call Dutch colonial.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.750
It was made by settlers... follow me...
using local timber.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.793
First Reformed took seven years to build.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.545
The Vei Plancks.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.923
Effie here, her tombstone dates back to 1787.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.595
The church was partially rebuilt
in 1837 following a fire.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.848
This section remains preserved.

23:53.474 --> 23:57.186
If you look closely behind
the Continental Army flag,

23:57.269 --> 23:59.438
you'll find two bullet holes

23:59.521 --> 24:03.025
from shots fired during
the Skirmish of Snowbridge.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.821
In two months we're celebrating
our 250th anniversary.

24:08.739 --> 24:11.365
Here is an example of some
of the church's chinaware

24:11.449 --> 24:12.867
brought over from the Netherlands.

24:13.159 --> 24:15.453
And the first chalice. It's beautiful.

24:15.828 --> 24:19.248
And here, this is the original key
from the front door before the fire.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.666
Isn't that neat? Yeah.

24:20.750 --> 24:24.295
And in that cabinet we have
souvenirs that are for sale.

24:24.378 --> 24:29.300
We have mugs, caps, postcards,
key chains, pens, t-shirts.

24:29.383 --> 24:30.343
What size are these?

24:30.426 --> 24:31.844
Unfortunately, they are all small.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.597
I have some more on order,
but I'm waiting for them to come in.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.890
The caps are great, though.

24:37.099 --> 24:38.392
It's a one-size-fits-all.

24:40.478 --> 24:44.940
The pulpit was donated in 1879
by William Mercer.

24:45.023 --> 24:47.234
And the church organ,

24:47.317 --> 24:50.028
which unfortunately
isn't working at this time,

24:51.404 --> 24:53.990
was manufactured in England by A.G. Hill.

24:55.325 --> 24:57.828
Did you hear the one about
the choir mistress and the minister?

24:59.579 --> 25:00.997
- No.
- She chased him

25:01.081 --> 25:02.916
around the church
and caught him by the organ.

25:05.043 --> 25:08.922
Huh. Oh, no, I hadn't heard that one.

25:09.381 --> 25:10.757
All right, come on. Follow me.

25:12.050 --> 25:14.093
All right, thank you all very much.

25:14.927 --> 25:16.011
- Be well.
- Thank you.

25:16.095 --> 25:18.054
Yeah, thanks a lot.

25:21.475 --> 25:22.601
Drive safe.

25:25.771 --> 25:26.689
Thanks.

25:33.254 --> 25:35.781
<i># Are you washed #</i>

25:35.865 --> 25:38.409
<i># In the blood? #</i>

25:38.492 --> 25:43.414

26:51.938 --> 26:58.945
<i># Are you washed
In the blood of the lamb? #</i>

27:00.196 --> 27:01.489
Okay, take five.

27:06.077 --> 27:10.247
- Penny for your thoughts?
- Oh, Joel wanted to talk to me.

27:10.873 --> 27:13.209
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- Oh, I assume not.

27:14.585 --> 27:15.795
You want to have lunch?

27:16.671 --> 27:20.383
Well, I have something after but yeah,
I could sit with you for a second.

27:23.927 --> 27:25.178
Oh, remember that?

27:25.679 --> 27:26.596
What?

27:27.430 --> 27:29.182
When everything was ahead of you.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.770
Yeah. But try telling them that.

27:34.646 --> 27:35.647
See you then.

27:57.084 --> 27:58.002
Hello.

27:58.627 --> 27:59.545
- Reverend Toller.
- Yes.

27:59.628 --> 28:00.546
- Oh, go right in.
- Okay.

28:00.629 --> 28:01.797
He's expecting you.

28:09.304 --> 28:12.391
Um, this is... that's my wife's stuff, so.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.328
Go ahead and deal with it.

28:16.603 --> 28:19.648
Oh, good! Reverend Toller. Come on in.

28:20.858 --> 28:23.610
Roger, make sure you get back to me
as soon as you can on that.

28:23.694 --> 28:24.902
- Hey, Reverend.
- Good seeing you.

28:24.986 --> 28:26.195
Why don't you have a seat there?

28:27.655 --> 28:29.615
Roger, okay to leave that door open.

28:29.699 --> 28:32.618
- Can I get you a water or anything?
- Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.

28:33.286 --> 28:36.497
- So how are things over at First Reformed?
- Oh, busy. You know how it is.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.959
You do one thing to the other,
next thing you know it's Sunday again.

28:40.209 --> 28:41.961
Yeah, tell me about it.

28:42.045 --> 28:45.923
Well, I brought you in, I wanted to ask you
about the 250th reconsecration.

28:46.007 --> 28:47.884
Now, that's just around the corner.

28:47.967 --> 28:50.428
Yeah, of course. It's only eight weeks away.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.138
And how's the planning going on that?

28:52.722 --> 28:55.058
Well, your office is handling the invitations

28:55.141 --> 28:56.641
and I'm a little worried about seating.

28:56.725 --> 28:59.519
I mean, because we have your staff,
we have the elders, we have the deacons.

28:59.603 --> 29:02.814
We have the governor, his people.
The mayor, his people.

29:02.898 --> 29:04.274
We don't have any room for spillover.

29:04.357 --> 29:05.984
You know, it's the sanctuary and that's it.

29:06.485 --> 29:10.155
You know what, I think we'll simulcast
the ceremony here, in the main room.

29:10.238 --> 29:11.615
- All right.
- So that's 5,000 seats.

29:11.698 --> 29:12.866
Yeah, okay. Well, then...

29:12.949 --> 29:14.993
We can do the reception in the rotunda.

29:15.619 --> 29:18.163
The organ at First Reformed.

29:18.246 --> 29:19.915
- Is that fixed?
- Yeah, no, it's not.

29:20.874 --> 29:23.543
We're waiting on some pieces.

29:23.627 --> 29:26.797
I don't... it was... it's just more
complicated than we thought at first.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.007
Well, we can't have a reconsecration
without an organ.

29:31.801 --> 29:33.886
"A Mighty Fortress is our God."

29:33.969 --> 29:35.763
That's all organ.

29:35.846 --> 29:39.308
Did you know that
Martin Luther wrote that in an outhouse?

29:39.391 --> 29:40.434
Oh, yeah.

29:40.518 --> 29:45.439
"A Mighty Fortress"...

29:47.066 --> 29:48.859
I think every seminarian knows that one.

29:48.943 --> 29:51.821
Oh, man, I cannot get
that image out of my mind.

29:51.904 --> 29:56.158
I mean, whenever I see that song going on,
and I can look around the congregation

29:56.242 --> 29:58.786
and know everybody's thinking the same thing.

29:58.869 --> 30:03.248
This man, oh, goodness. Oh, makes me laugh.

30:03.331 --> 30:06.126
Anyway, have you prepared your remarks?

30:06.209 --> 30:09.504
Oh, no. Not yet, but I will.

30:10.839 --> 30:12.924
- So how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

30:13.883 --> 30:14.801
No, really.

30:15.677 --> 30:18.138
I mean, it's been awhile since we've talked.

30:18.221 --> 30:20.306
And you know, even a pastor needs a pastor.

30:21.432 --> 30:22.433
We should do it, okay?

30:23.101 --> 30:24.185
I'd like that.

30:24.269 --> 30:26.271
Good. And come by here more often.

30:26.604 --> 30:29.607
You should get out.
Come on by and be a part of things.

30:29.691 --> 30:31.775
So many activities you can do, and...

30:31.859 --> 30:33.402
- And the kids like you a lot.
- Mmm.

30:33.485 --> 30:34.778
They always speak highly of you.

30:34.862 --> 30:37.156
So you can get out of that...
what is the play?

30:37.239 --> 30:38.866
What do they like to call it
over where you are?

30:38.949 --> 30:43.203
- The museum.
- The souvenir shop.

30:43.829 --> 30:45.122
They call it the souvenir shop.

30:45.205 --> 30:47.583
Well, good. Well, good.
You're doing a great job.

30:49.001 --> 30:50.669
I'm grateful for the opportunity.

31:21.365 --> 31:22.909
How was Jeffers?

31:22.992 --> 31:25.536
Oh, he wants me to meet Ed Balq.

31:26.078 --> 31:29.498
Balq Industries, Balq Energy,
Balq Paper, Balq Peanuts...

31:29.582 --> 31:30.499
Why?

31:31.125 --> 31:34.670
Well, it's all about the reconsecration.

31:34.754 --> 31:37.297
And apparently Mr. Balq wants
to make sure he gets

31:37.881 --> 31:40.008
proper credit for underwriting
the whole thing.

31:40.091 --> 31:41.092
Well, he should.

31:41.176 --> 31:43.511
First Reformed would be a parking lot
if it wasn't for him.

31:43.595 --> 31:44.512
I guess.

31:46.264 --> 31:47.515
Did you see the doctor?

31:49.351 --> 31:50.894
Yes, I made an appointment.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.480
There was a bit of a hang up
with the insurance company, but...

31:54.314 --> 31:55.690
God, they make it so difficult.

31:57.025 --> 31:59.986
- Yeah, well, that's what they do.
- Mm-hmm.

32:01.154 --> 32:02.906
You need someone to take care of you.

32:06.284 --> 32:10.287
Esther, we tried that. I'm not made for that.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.208
For what? Love?
You're not made for love?

32:16.168 --> 32:17.419
My marriage was a failure.

32:19.296 --> 32:21.882
No marriage can survive the loss of a child.

32:28.264 --> 32:29.181
It's not right.

32:33.769 --> 32:34.812
Is that what you think?

32:35.771 --> 32:37.356
That what we did together was a sin?

32:37.439 --> 32:40.942
- That we transgressed?
- No, that's not what I think.

32:41.901 --> 32:45.113
I've seen enough real sin
to know the difference. It's just...

32:46.990 --> 32:47.907
Okay?

32:48.324 --> 32:49.242
Okay.

32:50.159 --> 32:51.327
I understand, I...

32:52.662 --> 32:54.497
I care about you. I want you to be happy.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.584
Well, I am happy.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.862
<i>Some are called for their gregariousness.</i>

33:08.822 --> 33:10.489
<i>Some are called for their suffering.</i>

33:12.282 --> 33:14.284
<i>Others are called for their loneliness.</i>

33:15.661 --> 33:16.703
<i>They are called by God</i>

33:16.787 --> 33:18.664
<i>because through the vessel of communication,</i>

33:18.747 --> 33:19.873
<i>they can reach out</i>

33:19.957 --> 33:21.959
<i>and hold beating hearts in their hands.</i>

33:24.294 --> 33:26.713
<i>They are called because
of their all-consuming knowledge</i>

33:26.797 --> 33:28.757
<i>of the emptiness of all things</i>

33:29.258 --> 33:32.427
<i>that can only be filled
by the presence of our Savior.</i>

33:38.308 --> 33:40.060
- Yes?
- <i>Reverend Toller?</i>

33:40.144 --> 33:41.145
- Oh!
- <i>It's me.</i>

33:41.228 --> 33:42.146
Yes, Mary?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.523
I got your message about rescheduling.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.984
<i>You must come over. Now.</i>

33:49.193 --> 33:51.696
- Is Michael there?
- <i>No, he's at work.</i>

33:51.779 --> 33:55.283
- <i>You must come over now.</i>
- Okay. Okay.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.277
Thanks for coming.

34:25.447 --> 34:26.449
Follow me.

34:44.384 --> 34:48.262
I was looking for some batteries
'cause we were out.

34:48.344 --> 34:50.973
And I thought maybe
there'd be some in here, you know?

34:51.056 --> 34:54.143
And then something just didn't seem right.

34:56.270 --> 34:58.147
Okay, I put everything back
the way I found it,

34:58.230 --> 35:01.984
'cause I wanted you to see how it was.

35:18.585 --> 35:19.753
Explosives?

35:21.171 --> 35:22.505
It's a suicide vest.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.091
And there's other elements in there, too.

35:25.175 --> 35:30.055
There's batteries and detonators
and tubes of jelly.

35:32.807 --> 35:35.769
You know, he'd been working
in the garage lately,

35:35.852 --> 35:38.938
and he said he was fixing a motor.

35:39.814 --> 35:41.232
And I didn't question him.

35:41.316 --> 35:42.609
'Cause I was just happy

35:42.692 --> 35:44.903
that he was doing something
that made him happy.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.988
But you had no idea
that he was thinking of...

35:47.072 --> 35:50.199
No, no suspicions. Nothing like this.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.868
All right, well,
I'm gonna take this, all right?

35:52.951 --> 35:54.495
This cannot remain here.

35:54.578 --> 35:58.457
I'm gonna take it and dispose of it. And...

35:58.540 --> 36:00.209
You're not gonna go to the police?

36:00.793 --> 36:02.461
No, I won't... do you... do you want me to?

36:02.544 --> 36:05.422
- No! No, no, no.
- I don't think it'd help.

36:05.506 --> 36:07.299
I don't think anything good

36:07.383 --> 36:09.093
will come from him feeling threatened.

36:09.593 --> 36:12.638
I'm gonna come over tomorrow. Tomorrow.

36:13.681 --> 36:17.226
Somehow, through conversation,
I will address this.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.688
I'm so frightened.

36:20.771 --> 36:22.730
You don't mean
that he... you're afraid of him?

36:22.814 --> 36:24.273
- That he's gonna hurt you, right?
- No.

36:24.357 --> 36:26.234
- No, no, no. I'm afraid for him.
- No? Okay, all right.

36:26.317 --> 36:27.485
You know, are there other activists,

36:27.568 --> 36:29.821
- like, coming around, calling?
- No. There's nobody.

36:29.904 --> 36:32.824
He has no friends.
He's barely even sociable, so.

36:33.491 --> 36:34.575
All right, but he has you.

36:36.035 --> 36:36.994
- Yeah.
- You'll stand by him?

36:37.537 --> 36:40.123
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right. Well, so will I.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.514
<i>Discernment intersects
with Christian life at every moment.</i>

37:00.350 --> 37:01.268
<i>Discernment.</i>

37:04.396 --> 37:07.858
<i>Listening and waiting for God's wish
what action must be taken.</i>

37:23.707 --> 37:26.083
<i>My petty ailments have made me bad-tempered.</i>

37:27.334 --> 37:30.504
<i>I fight the urge not to write down
the thoughts which come to my mind.</i>

37:35.342 --> 37:38.228
<i>The desire to pray itself
is a type of prayer.</i>

37:39.388 --> 37:43.768
<i>How often we ask for genuine experience
when all we really want is emotion.</i>

37:48.814 --> 37:51.150
<i>My hands shake as I write these lines.</i>

38:11.753 --> 38:13.588
I wasn't expecting you
for another couple of weeks.

38:14.752 --> 38:16.295
We got a message from the boss.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.005
He said it was a top priority.

38:18.088 --> 38:19.673
You're having some kind of big event here?

38:20.174 --> 38:23.511
Yeah, the church is having
its 250th anniversary.

38:23.594 --> 38:26.597
Abundant Life is planning quite the ceremony.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.063
Hmm. "A Mighty Fortress."

40:31.287 --> 40:32.705
Jesus.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.483
My God.

41:01.608 --> 41:02.692
Yeah, see that?

41:03.610 --> 41:05.070
I mean, he had been fighting with depression.

41:05.153 --> 41:06.654
That's why I was supposed to meet him.

41:07.571 --> 41:09.365
I never imagined anything like this.

41:10.449 --> 41:12.368
Were you in touch with the immediate family?

41:12.451 --> 41:14.078
Well, his wife, Mary.

41:14.161 --> 41:16.413
She's the one who first
asked me to meet with him.

41:17.122 --> 41:18.457
Did she know about your text?

41:18.999 --> 41:21.752
No, but she was concerned. We both were.

41:22.378 --> 41:25.214
Hmm. Have you notified her?

41:27.257 --> 41:30.177
- No.
- I guess that's where I'm headed.

41:30.719 --> 41:32.054
All right. Okay.

41:32.471 --> 41:34.598
All right, do you mind
if I follow behind you?

41:34.890 --> 41:37.976
- All right.
- I knew his father.

41:38.852 --> 41:42.063
- Really? What's he like?
- A businessman.

41:42.772 --> 41:46.317
Morbid son of a bitch.
I guess it runs in the blood.

41:56.994 --> 41:58.162
Thank you, Reverend.

42:00.915 --> 42:03.334
Mrs. Mensana, hey again,
I'm sorry for your loss.

42:03.418 --> 42:05.253
If there's anything else that
we can do, please let us know.

42:05.336 --> 42:06.963
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Reverend.

42:07.046 --> 42:07.964
Thank you.

42:22.769 --> 42:24.187
You didn't tell the police, right?

42:25.730 --> 42:26.648
About?

42:27.399 --> 42:28.316
No.

42:29.526 --> 42:30.444
No.

42:32.112 --> 42:35.282
If you find anything else...

42:36.950 --> 42:39.953
like that, get rid of it.

42:41.163 --> 42:43.414
As long as it's safe, I mean.
Burn it, bury it.

42:44.832 --> 42:47.293
Michael was troubled but his cause was just.

42:47.376 --> 42:50.004
There's no reason to bring
disrepute on that cause.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.091
Are you an activist as well?

42:55.968 --> 42:57.595
I share Michael's beliefs.

43:00.222 --> 43:03.225
But not his despair. I mean, I wanna live.

43:03.309 --> 43:04.351
- I wanna be a mother.
- Right.

43:04.435 --> 43:06.520
I wanna have this child.

43:07.897 --> 43:09.565
Do you have family nearby?

43:09.648 --> 43:11.901
My... yeah, my sister. She's in Buffalo.

43:11.984 --> 43:13.944
- You might want to call her.
- I will.

43:24.162 --> 43:26.706
So he went into the garage?

43:29.501 --> 43:30.418
Yeah.

43:33.046 --> 43:33.963
What did he say?

43:35.798 --> 43:36.716
Nothing.

43:47.726 --> 43:49.269
Well, from a police point of view,

43:49.353 --> 43:53.607
I imagine this is
a pretty cut-and-dried case.

43:53.690 --> 43:58.779
Still, I'd probably clean up the office,
maybe get rid of his laptop.

44:04.701 --> 44:05.619
You...

44:31.227 --> 44:32.228
Open it.

45:05.468 --> 45:06.678
I'd sensed it.

45:08.013 --> 45:08.930
What?

45:10.932 --> 45:11.975
He was absent.

45:15.228 --> 45:17.272
He was becoming someone I didn't know.

45:21.151 --> 45:22.776
Like, before I was pregnant even.

45:25.529 --> 45:28.198
And he was just so full of anger, you know?

45:33.787 --> 45:35.664
Yeah, I should probably call my parents.

45:36.498 --> 45:37.416
My sister.

45:40.336 --> 45:42.713
They should... they should know.

45:45.424 --> 45:47.217
<i>I stayed while she called her sister.</i>

45:47.968 --> 45:49.720
<i>Her sister was going to drive down</i>

45:50.846 --> 45:52.973
<i>and her parents would come
for the final rights.</i>

45:58.311 --> 45:59.479
Hey, Bill. Chicken or beef?

46:00.063 --> 46:01.397
- Beef.
- Beef. Okay, great.

46:02.023 --> 46:02.940
How've you been?

46:03.316 --> 46:05.318
- I'm all right. Yeah.
- You okay?

46:08.112 --> 46:10.448
- Is that enough for you?
- Thanks a lot, Reverend.

46:11.824 --> 46:13.242
Did you want the chicken or the beef?

46:13.534 --> 46:16.120
- Uh, the beef, thank you.
- Beef? Yeah.

46:17.664 --> 46:20.291
There you are. Careful, it's hot.

46:21.626 --> 46:23.419
Reverend, I wanted to ask you...

46:23.503 --> 46:25.046
Oh, sh...

46:25.254 --> 46:27.881
Damn, I'm sorry, Joseph! I'm so sorry.

46:28.799 --> 46:29.716
<i>Terrible night.</i>

46:30.926 --> 46:34.012
<i>No sooner than I shut my eyes,
desolation came upon me.</i>

46:36.056 --> 46:38.475
<i>What is one's last thought
as you pull the trigger?</i>

46:40.519 --> 46:41.687
<i>"There goes my head."</i>

46:42.479 --> 46:45.023
<i>Or, "Jesus, watch over me."</i>

46:45.565 --> 46:46.483
<i>Or neither?</i>

46:48.193 --> 46:49.778
<i>I'm going to tear these pages out.</i>

46:50.862 --> 46:52.447
<i>This journal brings me no peace.</i>

46:53.407 --> 46:55.492
<i>It's self-pity. Nothing more.</i>

47:32.986 --> 47:34.904
<i>I awoke at 3:00 with a cry.</i>

47:36.072 --> 47:39.409
<i>It's been five months
since I sensed the first warning signs.</i>

47:43.872 --> 47:46.624
<i>I went into the church
and fell asleep on a bench.</i>

47:53.381 --> 47:55.425
<i>How easily they talk about prayer,</i>

47:56.134 --> 47:57.761
<i>those who have never really prayed.</i>

48:04.391 --> 48:05.476
Excuse me?

48:08.061 --> 48:09.271
Oh, my goodness!

48:11.231 --> 48:15.869
Well, since I made my commitment,
I have felt the Lord moving in my life.

48:16.252 --> 48:19.673
If happiness came in pill size,
it would have JC stamped on it.

48:21.617 --> 48:22.993
Continuous release size.

48:24.203 --> 48:26.997
I wake up feeling better.

48:27.080 --> 48:31.877
My relationships are better
and I got a raise last week.

48:32.585 --> 48:35.254
I find myself in prayer
without even thinking about it.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.510
Thank you, Jason. That is very inspiring.

48:41.385 --> 48:45.223
Praise Jesus. My every breath is a prayer.

48:46.224 --> 48:49.852
Thoughts? Reactions? Yes? Cynthia.

48:50.853 --> 48:52.897
Three months ago, my father got laid off.

48:54.273 --> 48:55.399
He can't find any work.

48:55.900 --> 48:58.069
Nobody loves the Lord more than my father.

48:58.152 --> 49:00.905
He is always testifying, he volunteers.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.241
Did he do something wrong?

49:07.234 --> 49:10.372
You all know Reverend Toller
from First Reformed.

49:11.456 --> 49:13.542
- Hello.
- Hey, yeah. Hi. Yeah.

49:14.459 --> 49:17.337
How do you answer this, Reverend?

49:18.338 --> 49:21.216
Well, Cynthia, I'm sorry
that happened to your father.

49:21.716 --> 49:26.304
There's a lot of church people,
good Christians, who see a connection

49:26.388 --> 49:29.391
between godliness and prosperity.

49:30.225 --> 49:31.935
But that's not what Jesus teaches.

49:32.519 --> 49:33.687
That's not what Jesus lived.

49:33.770 --> 49:35.605
There's no dollar sign on His pulpit.

49:36.188 --> 49:37.815
There's no American flag either.

49:38.732 --> 49:42.236
I think, Cynthia, what your father
is experiencing is...

49:42.319 --> 49:43.863
Christians shouldn't succeed.

49:44.655 --> 49:47.408
That's what he means.
Christianity is for losers?

49:47.867 --> 49:49.368
Jake, Jake!

49:49.451 --> 49:51.287
I just get tired of turn the other cheek.

49:51.787 --> 49:53.330
Jesus didn't turn the other cheek.

49:53.831 --> 49:54.832
Why stand for anything?

49:55.541 --> 49:56.876
Take prayer out of the schools.

49:57.418 --> 49:59.879
Give money to people too lazy to work for it.

49:59.962 --> 50:01.630
And whatever you do,
don't offend the Muslims.

50:03.090 --> 50:04.758
I mean, no sooner do I mention the poor,

50:04.842 --> 50:06.886
and this teenager jumps down my throat

50:06.969 --> 50:09.387
like I just took a shit on the American flag.

50:09.470 --> 50:12.891
Forgive my language. Oh, God!

50:12.974 --> 50:13.892
I know. Roger told me.

50:13.975 --> 50:16.769
He was great. He was terrific.
He's a good man.

50:16.853 --> 50:18.146
Well, he said you kept your cool

50:18.229 --> 50:19.272
and he admired you for that.

50:19.814 --> 50:21.482
There's just no middle ground
with these kids.

50:21.566 --> 50:23.359
Everything is so extreme.

50:23.735 --> 50:25.486
It's the times. These are frightening times.

50:25.570 --> 50:27.822
These kids, they grow up in a world

50:27.906 --> 50:30.158
that you and I, we wouldn't even recognize.

50:30.533 --> 50:34.370
Global warming, a sea of pornography,

50:34.454 --> 50:36.456
hyper violent video games.

50:36.539 --> 50:37.874
It's a world without privacy.

50:38.374 --> 50:41.585
Each kid isolated, communicating on media.

50:42.336 --> 50:43.545
It's a world without hope!

50:44.171 --> 50:45.714
You don't know what it's like
to raise a kid in this...

50:45.797 --> 50:46.965
No, I did raise a kid.

50:49.009 --> 50:51.303
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know you didn't.

50:53.055 --> 50:54.640
They're just frightened.

50:54.723 --> 50:56.642
- These kids, they want certainty.
- Mm-hmm.

50:56.725 --> 50:58.769
You know, don't think: follow.

51:01.146 --> 51:03.023
But they fall prey to extremism.

51:03.607 --> 51:06.109
Jihadism is everywhere.

51:06.610 --> 51:07.527
Even here.

51:07.611 --> 51:10.739
It's just... that's not
the church that called me.

51:10.822 --> 51:11.948
Nor me.

51:12.031 --> 51:15.076
It's up to us. We have to listen and guide

51:15.159 --> 51:19.497
and encourage our young members
to express themselves

51:19.580 --> 51:20.748
without judging them.

51:21.290 --> 51:22.333
We have to lead by example.

51:23.542 --> 51:24.710
We have to be patient.

51:35.348 --> 51:39.517
Oh, this sounds great. I'm gonna have to
sharpen my chops for the reconsecration.

51:40.009 --> 51:41.644
Do you know what they want to play?

51:41.727 --> 51:43.979
No, I have no idea.
Abundant Life is handling everything.

51:44.062 --> 51:45.271
Invites, the seating.

51:45.772 --> 51:47.357
Basically, I just introduce Joel.

51:47.857 --> 51:51.695
And then he does his spiel,
introduces the governor, maybe Ed Balq.

51:51.778 --> 51:55.323
- Oh, why him?
- It's sort of his whole deal.

51:55.407 --> 51:58.159
I mean, he's underwritten the whole thing,
paid to have the organ fixed.

51:58.910 --> 51:59.828
I do have another...

51:59.911 --> 52:02.755
- Oh, take it from the top.
- ...musical question for you.

52:16.301 --> 52:19.596
It's actually
a... kind of sad bit of business.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.640
- Hmm?
- The Michael Mensana memorial.

52:21.724 --> 52:25.310
The scattering of his ashes.
He's asked me to arrange it.

52:26.729 --> 52:27.730
He's asked you?

52:29.106 --> 52:32.401
Well, he wrote a letter.
He had some requests.

52:37.406 --> 52:39.033
Then the Lord spoke to Job,

52:39.700 --> 52:40.784
stepped from the storm.

52:42.077 --> 52:44.455
He said, "Where were you
when I laid the earth's foundations,

52:44.538 --> 52:48.166
marked out its dimensions,
laid its cornerstone?

52:51.669 --> 52:53.254
When the morning stars sang,

52:54.756 --> 52:58.342
and the angels
shouted with joy, where were you?"

53:02.055 --> 53:03.681
These surroundings were chosen by Michael

53:03.765 --> 53:06.100
as the repository for his physical remains.

53:06.768 --> 53:08.394
I say physical because his memories

53:08.478 --> 53:10.063
and spirit live on with us,

53:10.938 --> 53:12.106
as does his mission.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.859
Michael cared about this world.

53:16.277 --> 53:17.361
Perhaps too much.

53:19.071 --> 53:22.407
The Abundant Life youth choir
will now sing for us

53:23.075 --> 53:24.367
a song chosen by Michael.

53:36.973 --> 53:42.052
<i># Protect the wild, tomorrow's child #</i>

53:42.844 --> 53:47.516
<i># Protect the land from the greed of man #</i>

53:48.225 --> 53:53.062
<i># Take out the dams, stand up to oil #</i>

53:53.687 --> 53:58.150
<i># Protect the plants and renew the soil #</i>

53:58.943 --> 54:03.155
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

54:04.073 --> 54:08.285
<i># Who's gonna say that she's had enough? #</i>

54:08.953 --> 54:13.332
<i># Who's gonna take on the big machine? #</i>

54:13.833 --> 54:17.920
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

54:18.379 --> 54:22.590
<i># This all starts with you and me #</i>

54:26.427 --> 54:28.555
<i># End fossil fuels #</i>

54:29.055 --> 54:30.890
<i># Draw the line #</i>

54:31.307 --> 54:35.520
<i># Before we build one more pipeline #</i>

54:36.271 --> 54:38.064
<i># End fracking now #</i>

54:38.606 --> 54:40.525
<i># Let's save the water #</i>

54:41.109 --> 54:45.280
<i># And build a life
For our sons and daughters #</i>

54:46.030 --> 54:50.285
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

54:50.994 --> 54:54.955
<i># Who's gonna say that she's had enough? #</i>

54:55.831 --> 54:59.877
<i># Who's gonna take on the big machine? #</i>

55:00.669 --> 55:04.715
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

55:05.132 --> 55:10.012
<i># This all starts with you and me #</i>

55:33.117 --> 55:34.160
- I'm good.
- All right.

55:47.215 --> 55:48.507
- Mr. Balq!
- Hey!

55:48.591 --> 55:50.009
- Hello!
- How are you?

55:50.092 --> 55:51.594
- Very good, very good.
- Good, good, good.

55:53.471 --> 55:57.266
Hey. Sorry I'm late. I got... I got held up.

55:57.682 --> 55:59.351
Oh, good. You know Reverend Toller, right?

55:59.434 --> 56:00.977
Well, only by sight. Ed Balq.

56:01.061 --> 56:02.479
- Good to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

56:04.189 --> 56:05.106
Just bring me a coffee

56:05.190 --> 56:07.108
- and the apple pie, all right?
- Okay. Thank you.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.277
The apple pie.

56:09.361 --> 56:11.905
I know it's a clichÃ©
but they make it right here.

56:11.988 --> 56:13.740
It's organic. It's local.

56:14.532 --> 56:16.201
I have a surprise for you.

56:16.284 --> 56:21.039
I stopped by the printer on the way over.

56:23.875 --> 56:24.793
Oh.

56:25.627 --> 56:29.130
Oh, nice. Nice. They did a great job.

56:29.214 --> 56:32.299
Yeah, all the guests
at the reconsecration will get a copy.

56:32.383 --> 56:34.134
And then there will also be a mailing.

56:34.218 --> 56:36.512
And of course it will be
available at the bookstore.

56:36.929 --> 56:38.055
So how are the plans coming?

56:38.764 --> 56:40.015
Is the organ repaired?

56:40.099 --> 56:42.351
Oh, yeah. It sounds beautiful.
Better than ever.

56:43.060 --> 56:47.481
Okay. We drew up a little seating chart.

56:48.065 --> 56:49.817
Now, Mayor Wilson will be there,

56:50.234 --> 56:51.193
as well as the governor.

56:51.277 --> 56:52.319
Well, at least he's going to try...

56:52.403 --> 56:53.988
<i>All of those mighty men of God,</i>

56:54.905 --> 56:56.323
<i>servants of the cross.</i>

56:56.407 --> 57:00.786
<i>Years of service, baptisms,
confessions, funerals, sermons.</i>

57:00.869 --> 57:02.245
<i>The hours in prayer,</i>

57:02.704 --> 57:04.247
<i>the afflictions suffered.</i>

57:04.789 --> 57:06.165
<i>Did God give them strength?</i>

57:06.791 --> 57:08.418
Reverend Toller will introduce me.

57:08.668 --> 57:10.670
I'll go up, I'll introduce the governor.

57:11.004 --> 57:12.922
There'll be a song selection.
Now, the main...

57:13.006 --> 57:14.757
There won't be anything
political though, will there?

57:15.508 --> 57:17.593
No. No, why would there be?

57:18.386 --> 57:19.679
Well... oh, sorry. Do you mind?

57:19.762 --> 57:20.763
Here you are.

57:21.180 --> 57:22.390
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:22.473 --> 57:24.684
- Well, I ask...
- Enjoy.

57:24.767 --> 57:27.770
...only 'cause this came to my attention.

57:28.813 --> 57:31.107
It's a printout from a website.

57:31.858 --> 57:35.068
Well, both First Reformed
and Abundant Life are mentioned by name.

57:35.152 --> 57:39.072
It was a political event.
A Neil Young protest song?

57:40.073 --> 57:43.785
I was just respecting the wishes
of the deceased and his widow.

57:43.869 --> 57:46.371
It was their instructions
for the memorial service.

57:46.455 --> 57:49.666
At a toxic waste site
with the press in attendance?

57:49.750 --> 57:51.043
There was no press invited.

57:51.126 --> 57:52.961
No, this is just Mensana's friends.

57:53.045 --> 57:54.296
It was a political act.

57:54.379 --> 57:57.466
And you and the choir represented
the Abundant Life Church.

57:57.549 --> 58:00.260
And the Hanstown site,
by the way, isn't even polluted.

58:00.344 --> 58:02.054
It was cleaned up with EPA superfunds.

58:02.846 --> 58:04.514
- Well, Hanstown...
- No, no, of course not,

58:04.598 --> 58:06.807
but just give me some credit, all right?
I'm in the energy business.

58:06.891 --> 58:08.267
It's my business to stay informed.

58:09.435 --> 58:10.519
Look, sorry.

58:10.936 --> 58:13.898
Reverend Toller didn't understand
the implications here.

58:15.666 --> 58:17.334
- May I ask a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

58:17.668 --> 58:18.836
Will God forgive us?

58:22.506 --> 58:25.050
Will God forgive us for what
we're doing to his creation?

58:25.134 --> 58:27.845
That's what Mensana asked me
when I visited him.

58:29.138 --> 58:33.016
This... there's been a lot of loose talk
about environmental change.

58:33.100 --> 58:36.103
There is scientific consensus.
Ninety-seven percent...

58:36.186 --> 58:39.147
<i>The man who says nothing</i>
<i>always seems more intelligent.</i>

58:39.772 --> 58:41.732
<i>Why couldn't I just keep silent?</i>

58:43.317 --> 58:45.027
It's a complicated subject.

58:45.111 --> 58:46.028
Not really.

58:46.654 --> 58:48.239
I mean, who benefits?

58:49.031 --> 58:50.116
<i>Cui bono?</i> Who profits?

58:50.199 --> 58:51.450
That's what I keep asking myself.

58:51.534 --> 58:55.663
Besides the Biblical call to stewardship,
who profits when we soil our own nest?

58:55.746 --> 58:57.540
- What's to be gained...
- Can we just agree to keep politics

58:57.623 --> 58:59.000
out of the reconsecration service?

58:59.083 --> 59:01.711
- Yes.
- Yeah, but this isn't politics.

59:01.794 --> 59:05.631
- I mean, what God wants is for...
- Oh, you know the mind of God?

59:05.715 --> 59:07.300
You spoke to Him, personally?

59:07.842 --> 59:09.467
He told you His plans for Earth?

59:12.679 --> 59:15.849
Look, I understand, you're upset.

59:18.852 --> 59:20.812
I mean, you found the body, correct?

59:22.314 --> 59:23.231
Yes.

59:24.755 --> 59:25.672
How?

59:32.012 --> 59:34.514
I was supposed to meet him.

59:35.349 --> 59:40.603
And he texted me and... a change of location.

59:41.145 --> 59:42.063
And?

59:44.565 --> 59:45.983
And I went there and he was dead.

59:50.029 --> 59:51.614
So you counseled him, Reverend?

59:53.282 --> 59:54.200
Yes.

59:54.825 --> 59:57.870
You counseled him, then he shot himself?

59:58.662 --> 59:59.580
Ed?

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:02.583
Yes.

01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:07.880
Well, I think you need
to step back, Reverend,

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.842
and take a look at your own life
before you criticize others.

01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:13.968
Hmm?

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:36.327
<i>Mary and I rode the park trail.</i>

01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:41.707
<i>I had not ridden a bicycle,
I think, in 20 years.</i>

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:49.084
<i>I was afraid I would fall.</i>

01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:59.052
<i>It's amazing the simple,
curative power of exercise.</i>

01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:06.143
<i>It's God-given.</i>

01:01:14.484 --> 01:01:15.860
Thank you again.

01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:19.947
Michael and I used to cycle twice a week
and I've missed it so much.

01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:21.490
Oh, I enjoyed it.

01:01:22.283 --> 01:01:24.118
It's been a long time.

01:01:24.201 --> 01:01:25.536
But it was under protest.

01:01:26.704 --> 01:01:29.165
- I asked my doctor.
- Really? Still.

01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:33.377
- Can I ask you another favor?
- Sure.

01:01:34.128 --> 01:01:37.214
Could you box up Michael's things?
Or find somebody to do it?

01:01:39.717 --> 01:01:41.510
You sure you want to give them
away so quickly?

01:01:42.219 --> 01:01:44.597
Not, like, not give it away, just, you know.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.849
Just box them up.
It just, you know, I feel...

01:01:48.767 --> 01:01:53.730
it's just difficult to be around
so many smells and memories, you know?

01:01:54.105 --> 01:01:55.940
Yeah, I can... I can do it.

01:01:56.024 --> 01:01:56.941
Okay.

01:01:57.358 --> 01:01:58.693
Have you decided what's next?

01:01:58.777 --> 01:02:02.363
Um, the rent's paid for for two months,
so there's no hurry.

01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:05.325
But I'm gonna stay
with my sister and my brother-in-law.

01:02:05.408 --> 01:02:07.285
- Hmm, are you?
- Until the baby is born.

01:02:07.368 --> 01:02:08.828
So you'll relocate there?

01:02:08.912 --> 01:02:09.829
Yeah, I think so.

01:02:10.663 --> 01:02:12.707
She contacted an obstetrician.

01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.169
Are we talking pink or blue?

01:02:17.378 --> 01:02:18.463
- Blue.
- Blue.

01:02:18.546 --> 01:02:20.255
- Blue! Thanks.
- Ah, congratulations.

01:02:20.339 --> 01:02:21.465
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

01:02:23.675 --> 01:02:27.930
Oh, hey, I have a question
for you if it's not too painful.

01:02:31.934 --> 01:02:35.354
Do you think he really
would have harmed someone?

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:41.068
Um...

01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:46.532
He'd been a part of some...
nonviolent protests.

01:02:47.616 --> 01:02:50.327
We both had. He'd been put in jail.

01:02:51.577 --> 01:02:52.495
He had a temper.

01:02:53.454 --> 01:02:56.290
I mean, he'd start yelling at police,
but no, I don't think he was...

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.293
No. I don't think he was violent.

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.589
I just, um...

01:03:05.466 --> 01:03:09.137
I can't help but keep wondering
what I should have done differently.

01:03:13.391 --> 01:03:14.684
He didn't want to live.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.482
He was not a religious man, you know.

01:03:23.775 --> 01:03:26.236
He didn't care for the church. That was me.

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:27.988
I was the one who asked him to come.

01:03:28.655 --> 01:03:32.200
I was raised in the church
and I never could quite let it go.

01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:35.537
I'd be in a strange city and I would just go

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.497
to a church and sit down, you know?

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:39.249
I was the spiritual one.

01:03:45.172 --> 01:03:46.089
Thanks.

01:03:46.715 --> 01:03:50.177
Yeah, I'll... I'm gonna go get some boxes.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.595
- I'll come back for the clothes.
- Okay.

01:03:55.806 --> 01:03:57.308
Reverend? Um...

01:04:00.394 --> 01:04:02.980
would you... pray with me?

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.651
I just... I find it difficult to do it alone.

01:04:07.735 --> 01:04:10.487
Just, the words just don't come.

01:04:12.573 --> 01:04:14.074
Are you uncomfortable
with me asking you that?

01:04:14.158 --> 01:04:17.119
- No. No, no, no. Of course not, yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.708
Dear Heavenly Father...

01:04:24.752 --> 01:04:27.420
we invite you into this room,
into our heart...

01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:30.673
<i>I held her hand, I spoke,</i>

01:04:32.008 --> 01:04:33.593
<i>and the words came out of my mouth.</i>

01:04:34.552 --> 01:04:38.473
<i>"By thy words, you shall be justified
and by thy words, you shall be condemned."</i>

01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:45.124
<i>I can no longer ignore my health.</i>

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.544
<i>I have postponed my checkup too often.</i>

01:05:50.296 --> 01:05:52.631
<i>Yesterday, I could literally barely stand.</i>

01:06:51.021 --> 01:06:53.607
<i>No, I have not lost my faith.</i>

01:08:13.579 --> 01:08:16.540
"And the rich man said,
'I will pull down my barns

01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:17.950
and build greater.'

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.629
And I will say to my soul,

01:08:21.712 --> 01:08:25.215
'take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.'

01:08:25.716 --> 01:08:27.384
But God said unto his disciples,

01:08:27.468 --> 01:08:28.928
'take no thought for your life,

01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:30.804
what ye shall eat.'

01:08:33.265 --> 01:08:36.352
Neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:41.147
The life is more than meat,

01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:45.234
and the body is more than raiment."

01:08:46.152 --> 01:08:48.947
Thus ends the reading of the Lord.
Praise be God.

01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:51.282
When did he come back?

01:08:51.366 --> 01:08:53.618
Well, he was out most of Friday.

01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:55.870
So he went to Albany for his checkup?

01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:58.497
I asked him, but he didn't
give me any details.

01:08:58.915 --> 01:08:59.832
You know how he is.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.251
Perhaps I can check.

01:09:02.335 --> 01:09:04.545
- Esther.
- It's just...

01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:07.215
I know. I know.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.970
- Okay, all right. Bye.
- See you.

01:09:26.566 --> 01:09:29.152
We'd like to do a gastroscopic exam.

01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:32.531
We lower a fiber optic camera
down the throat and esophagus

01:09:32.613 --> 01:09:33.532
and take a look around.

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:35.575
It's an outpatient procedure,
local anesthetic.

01:09:35.658 --> 01:09:37.327
You should be able to leave by midafternoon.

01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:39.371
Still, that doesn't...
that doesn't sound too good.

01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:42.374
Well, we'd like to check
for evidence of malignancy.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:43.375
Cancer.

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:47.169
Cancer's not the fearsome
medical foe it once was.

01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:48.796
Mm-hmm.

01:09:51.549 --> 01:09:53.676
What's the treatment for that?

01:09:55.136 --> 01:09:57.847
It depends on how far advanced the tumor is.

01:09:58.931 --> 01:09:59.849
But?

01:10:00.099 --> 01:10:02.143
You stated you've been
experiencing discomfort.

01:10:02.852 --> 01:10:03.769
Uh-huh.

01:10:04.186 --> 01:10:05.604
- Yeah.
- Six months?

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.235
Well, diet, medication, chemo, even surgery.

01:10:11.318 --> 01:10:13.446
We have a variety of diagnostic tools.

01:10:14.113 --> 01:10:15.281
Have you had any bloody stools?

01:10:20.785 --> 01:10:21.703
Recently?

01:10:24.789 --> 01:10:28.251
Okay. I'd like to schedule
the gastroscopy as soon as possible.

01:10:28.334 --> 01:10:31.838
We have an open slot week after next.

01:10:32.881 --> 01:10:33.798
Okay.

01:10:34.174 --> 01:10:35.091
What's your diet?

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.093
My diet? Um...

01:10:38.136 --> 01:10:39.220
I'm hungry, I eat.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:40.680
- Smoke?
- No.

01:10:40.764 --> 01:10:41.681
Drink?

01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:44.934
Mmm, in moderation.

01:10:45.018 --> 01:10:45.935
That needs to end.

01:10:46.686 --> 01:10:49.146
I'm gonna call in a prescription to help
with the stomach pain.

01:10:49.229 --> 01:10:51.440
And I want you to take
nutritional supplements.

01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:53.358
Okay.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.527
Are you in pain now?

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:58.113
No, I feel good.

01:11:00.365 --> 01:11:04.286
<i>We tend to think that anxiety and worry</i>

01:11:04.369 --> 01:11:08.123
<i>are simply an indication of how wise we are,</i>

01:11:08.749 --> 01:11:10.626
<i>yet it is a much better indication</i>

01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:12.544
<i>of how wicked we are.</i>

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.675
<i>Fretting arises from our determination
to have our own way.</i>

01:11:19.717 --> 01:11:21.636
<i>Our Lord never worried</i>

01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:23.763
<i>and was never anxious.</i>

01:11:25.431 --> 01:11:27.100
- I'll be back in a bit.
- <i>Because His purpose</i>

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:31.062
<i>was to accomplish not His own plans...</i>

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.069
- Reverend?
- Hi, Esther.

01:11:38.152 --> 01:11:40.029
I didn't know you were coming.

01:11:40.113 --> 01:11:41.155
Well, Joel's office called.

01:11:41.239 --> 01:11:43.199
They want to talk to me about
the reconsecration program.

01:11:43.282 --> 01:11:44.283
Did they talk to you?

01:11:44.951 --> 01:11:46.494
I'll be at First Reformed.

01:11:46.577 --> 01:11:49.122
And Stanley will be with
the full choir here for the simulcast.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:50.331
Mm-hmm, nice.

01:11:50.414 --> 01:11:51.748
The acoustics will be wonderful.

01:11:51.832 --> 01:11:52.749
- I mean...
- Stop.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.000
Really wonderful.

01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:56.086
Did you hear from Albany?

01:11:56.169 --> 01:11:58.171
- Yeah, I did.
- Well, what did they say?

01:11:58.255 --> 01:12:00.966
- Nothing, just some more tests.
- A gastroscopy.

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.136
And you know this how?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.555
I called.

01:12:06.638 --> 01:12:09.432
- I'm worried about you.
- Leave me alone!

01:12:11.143 --> 01:12:13.645
- I just want to try...
- I know what you want!

01:12:13.728 --> 01:12:17.899
All right, and I cannot bear your concern,
your constant hovering, your neediness.

01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:20.443
You... you're a constant reminder

01:12:20.527 --> 01:12:23.445
of my own personal inadequacies and failings.

01:12:23.529 --> 01:12:27.199
You want something that never
was and never will be.

01:12:28.117 --> 01:12:30.286
- Don't make me do this, 'cause I...
- Esther, Esther, Esther.

01:12:30.619 --> 01:12:32.371
Pull yourself together, okay?

01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:34.206
- You don't take care of yourself.
- Look at yourself.

01:12:35.416 --> 01:12:36.333
I despise you.

01:12:37.877 --> 01:12:40.212
I despise what you bring out in me.

01:12:40.963 --> 01:12:42.423
Your concerns are petty.

01:12:43.424 --> 01:12:45.259
You are a stumbling block.

01:12:58.354 --> 01:12:59.814
<i>I suddenly feel much better.</i>

01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:05.403
<i>I awoke early, clearheaded,
and immediately set about my daily tasks.</i>

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.523
<i>"The nations raged"...</i>

01:16:28.525 --> 01:16:30.018
<i>"But your wrath came</i>

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.772
<i>and the time for the dead to be judged.</i>

01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:39.527
<i>And for rewarding your servants
and prophets and saints</i>

01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:42.655
<i>and for those who fear your name</i>

01:16:43.572 --> 01:16:44.824
<i>both small and great.</i>

01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:50.413
<i>And for destroying
the destroyers of the earth."</i>

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:57.420
<i>Revelations 11:18.</i>

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.362
<i>I have removed the previous pages.</i>

01:17:24.446 --> 01:17:25.905
<i>They were written in delirium.</i>

01:17:27.282 --> 01:17:29.367
<i>But I am determined to continue.</i>

01:17:31.578 --> 01:17:34.038
<i>It's hard to struggle against torpor.</i>

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.583
<i>I must set pen to paper.</i>

01:17:59.855 --> 01:18:00.772
Shit.

01:18:15.828 --> 01:18:18.289
- Oh, hey, Mary.
- Hi. Can I come in?

01:18:18.372 --> 01:18:20.249
Yeah, of course. Come on in.
Come on, come on.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.627
Come in. Do you need anything?

01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:24.504
Do you want... can I take your coat?

01:18:24.587 --> 01:18:26.797
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you all right?

01:18:27.632 --> 01:18:30.760
- Um...
- Let me get this.

01:18:30.843 --> 01:18:31.886
No.

01:18:35.264 --> 01:18:37.558
I'm just... I'm really frightened.

01:18:37.642 --> 01:18:39.227
I'm, like, I'm frightened of everything.

01:18:42.605 --> 01:18:45.982
I woke up and my heart was pounding
and I thought, like, the roof,

01:18:46.066 --> 01:18:47.984
the ceiling, was just gonna fall in.

01:18:49.402 --> 01:18:52.030
- So I had to get out.
- Yeah...

01:18:52.113 --> 01:18:54.074
And I just drove around and I...

01:18:54.908 --> 01:18:57.160
I didn't put any makeup on. Sorry.

01:18:57.244 --> 01:18:58.245
I'm glad you came.

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:01.998
Do you want some water or some tea...

01:19:02.082 --> 01:19:02.999
Without warning...

01:19:05.252 --> 01:19:07.170
this dark curtain just fell.

01:19:08.255 --> 01:19:11.049
I'm scared of everything.

01:19:11.132 --> 01:19:12.676
Well, you did the right thing coming here.

01:19:12.759 --> 01:19:14.094
I just can't stop my thoughts.

01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:16.221
They just keep going on and on.

01:19:16.304 --> 01:19:17.429
They repeat and repeat.

01:19:19.098 --> 01:19:21.016
Did this ever happen before Michael's death?

01:19:22.726 --> 01:19:23.644
A little.

01:19:24.853 --> 01:19:26.188
Yeah, not like this, though.

01:19:27.815 --> 01:19:30.109
I read online that they used to believe

01:19:30.192 --> 01:19:32.653
that pregnancy made you happy,
but now they feel like

01:19:32.736 --> 01:19:34.655
it just makes your feelings more extreme.

01:19:38.617 --> 01:19:39.535
Michael...

01:19:41.996 --> 01:19:44.039
he was just really strong.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.457
How so?

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:51.254
Um, he listened. He was kind.

01:19:53.965 --> 01:19:57.135
We used to do this thing
called the magical mystery tour.

01:19:58.303 --> 01:20:00.763
It sounds silly, but, um...

01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:03.600
we would share a joint

01:20:04.642 --> 01:20:07.103
and lay on top of each other fully clothed.

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:11.816
We would try to get as much
body to body contact as possible.

01:20:13.026 --> 01:20:14.402
We'd have our hands out and...

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:18.156
we would just look straight
into each other's eyes

01:20:19.198 --> 01:20:23.076
and move them in unison,
like, right, left, right, left.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.871
And then we would breathe in rhythm.

01:20:32.919 --> 01:20:34.171
You want me to do this?

01:20:37.007 --> 01:20:39.259
No. I didn't mean that.

01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:43.096
- All right.
- I mean, I...

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:49.519
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I guess,
I... yeah, I guess I did.

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:51.563
Okay.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.606
Uh, show me.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.860
Well... you lay on your back

01:20:57.943 --> 01:21:00.154
and with your arms
and your legs stretched out.

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.781
Do we need music?

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.367
No, we just listen to the breaths.

01:21:05.701 --> 01:21:08.162
Just... lie down?

01:21:09.205 --> 01:21:11.582
Yeah. And then, yeah.

01:25:25.786 --> 01:25:27.288
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on!

01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:29.498
- There you go, you got it.
- Come on, Benny. Come on, Benny.

01:25:29.582 --> 01:25:32.960
Okay, guys, let's all get seated
in the first pew right here.

01:25:33.044 --> 01:25:34.086
All the way down.

01:25:38.924 --> 01:25:40.008
All right, good job, guys.

01:25:40.091 --> 01:25:43.637
Okay, so last week,
we read <i>The Patchwork Path</i>

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.848
about the Underground Railroad,
which was not a railroad, but...

01:25:47.974 --> 01:25:50.310
- Rosa?
- It was a slave trail.

01:25:50.727 --> 01:25:53.396
It was an escape route
from the South to the North.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.651
And this church, First Reformed,
was one of the stops on that route.

01:25:57.734 --> 01:25:58.652
Reverend Toller?

01:25:58.735 --> 01:26:01.780
Yeah. Slaves fleeing north to Canada

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:05.575
were often helped, fed, hidden
by homes and churches

01:26:05.659 --> 01:26:06.743
along this route.

01:26:06.826 --> 01:26:10.496
Calvin Verlander was the dominee,
the minister here at First Reformed.

01:26:10.579 --> 01:26:12.706
And he was very active
in the Abolitionist Movement.

01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:14.208
He assisted in...

01:26:15.084 --> 01:26:17.169
No, Ms. Surya, let me try this.

01:26:17.252 --> 01:26:18.796
Why don't you all stand up for a second?

01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:19.880
Take a look right here.

01:26:19.964 --> 01:26:22.341
Do you see one part of wood
that seems different

01:26:22.424 --> 01:26:23.968
- than the other part of the wood?
- Yeah!

01:26:24.176 --> 01:26:25.803
You all see that, don't you?

01:26:25.886 --> 01:26:27.096
But does this seem a little bit

01:26:27.179 --> 01:26:29.515
- like a secret door, hmm?
- Yes.

01:26:29.598 --> 01:26:31.517
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Benny.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.643
Benny, will you give me a hand?

01:26:32.726 --> 01:26:33.936
- Come on over here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:34.019 --> 01:26:36.021
You see, there used to be a pew over this.

01:26:36.105 --> 01:26:38.232
And they would move it
and then they would lift this up.

01:26:38.315 --> 01:26:39.233
Can you do it? Help me.

01:26:41.193 --> 01:26:44.362
Yes! Oh! Come around, everybody.

01:26:44.445 --> 01:26:45.363
Can you hold this up?

01:26:45.446 --> 01:26:47.573
Slaves would hide in here.
Sometimes whole families.

01:26:47.657 --> 01:26:49.492
Be really careful. All right.

01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:51.369
Can you imagine that?

01:26:52.537 --> 01:26:53.454
In the dark.

01:26:54.205 --> 01:26:55.415
The air hot,

01:26:56.332 --> 01:26:57.208
shaking with fear.

01:26:57.291 --> 01:27:00.128
The sound of the slave hunter's
horses outside.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.006
On their knees, holding each other's hands,

01:27:03.089 --> 01:27:04.632
praying for God to save them?

01:27:11.431 --> 01:27:13.515
Do you want me to pack up
anything here in the kitchen?

01:27:13.598 --> 01:27:16.101
No, I can get it later. Thanks.

01:27:20.772 --> 01:27:22.274
I'd love to meet your sister sometime.

01:27:24.276 --> 01:27:26.278
- You wanna come to Buffalo?
- If I'm invited, I'd love to.

01:27:26.361 --> 01:27:28.238
- You gonna visit me?
- I would, yeah!

01:27:28.739 --> 01:27:29.948
I'd love to meet Michael, Jr.

01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:32.743
You've been such a help to me.

01:27:33.869 --> 01:27:37.205
My great-grandfather
was a pastor in Muskegon, Michigan.

01:27:37.289 --> 01:27:38.290
The Saint of God.

01:27:38.999 --> 01:27:41.710
And the bank in town
was a two-story building,

01:27:41.793 --> 01:27:43.378
the first building to have an elevator.

01:27:44.171 --> 01:27:45.172
And one Monday,

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.799
Granddad got the boys all together

01:27:48.883 --> 01:27:51.302
and they went into town
to deposit church funds,

01:27:51.927 --> 01:27:53.054
as they did every Monday.

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:54.889
And they needed to go talk to the managers.

01:27:54.972 --> 01:27:57.475
They got on the elevator
and he had a heart attack.

01:27:59.643 --> 01:28:01.812
And he took off his hat.

01:28:01.896 --> 01:28:03.189
Apparently, he always wore a hat.

01:28:03.272 --> 01:28:04.940
And he took off his hat and he said,

01:28:05.024 --> 01:28:09.862
"Boys, take off my shoes.
I'm standing on holy ground."

01:28:11.447 --> 01:28:12.364
And then he died.

01:28:13.783 --> 01:28:15.743
Somewhere between the first and second floor.

01:28:18.536 --> 01:28:21.998
Yeah, I think about that story
when I think about Michael.

01:28:24.793 --> 01:28:27.504
'Cause I believe he was standing
on holy ground when he died.

01:28:39.974 --> 01:28:40.892
Thank you.

01:28:42.435 --> 01:28:44.104
So I'll see you in Buffalo?

01:28:44.813 --> 01:28:47.023
I think I'm gonna go to the reconsecration.

01:28:48.525 --> 01:28:50.692
Oh. No, you don't need to do that.

01:28:51.235 --> 01:28:53.237
- But I want to.
- Yeah, but it's not necessary.

01:28:53.987 --> 01:28:56.365
Yeah, but you've been there for me
and I want to be there for you.

01:28:56.448 --> 01:28:58.700
It's very nice of you to offer,

01:28:58.784 --> 01:29:01.745
but it's just a bunch of rich guys
patting each other on the back.

01:29:01.829 --> 01:29:03.497
- But you're gonna be there.
- But I have to be there.

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.666
- So I'm gonna go.
- Please don't come.

01:29:06.834 --> 01:29:08.043
Okay? I don't want you to come.

01:29:08.919 --> 01:29:09.837
You understand?

01:29:12.548 --> 01:29:13.465
Okay.

01:29:15.968 --> 01:29:17.719
Right. Have a nice evening.

01:29:46.664 --> 01:29:49.625
<i>"Be strong in the Lord
and in His mighty power.</i>

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:54.212
<i>Put on the full armor of God</i>

01:29:54.296 --> 01:29:58.800
<i>so that you can take your stand
against the devil's schemes.</i>

01:29:58.884 --> 01:30:01.928
<i>For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood</i>

01:30:04.055 --> 01:30:07.934
<i>but against the rulers,
against the authorities,</i>

01:30:08.852 --> 01:30:11.813
<i>against the powers of this dark world."</i>

01:30:50.809 --> 01:30:56.147
Balq Home Products,
makers of paper goods, fertilizers,

01:30:57.232 --> 01:31:00.026
everyday items for the household,

01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:02.528
was among the first companies

01:31:02.612 --> 01:31:07.283
to realize the need
to address environmental concerns.

01:31:07.784 --> 01:31:10.119
Sir? Are you joining us?

01:31:11.412 --> 01:31:16.000
This unit makes recyclable plastic markers.

01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:20.588
Balq has facilities
or production arrangements

01:31:20.672 --> 01:31:24.509
with 18 countries around the world.

01:31:31.765 --> 01:31:34.559
<i>Today, I stopped. I had Miso and fish.</i>

01:31:38.855 --> 01:31:40.440
<i>Such simple pleasures.</i>

01:31:43.819 --> 01:31:45.445
<i>Why do we deny ourselves?</i>

01:32:40.206 --> 01:32:44.127
<i>Every act of preservation
is an act of creation.</i>

01:32:44.794 --> 01:32:47.255
<i>Everything preserved renews creation.</i>

01:32:48.381 --> 01:32:50.508
<i>It's how we participate in creation.</i>

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:42.433
<i>I have found another form of prayer.</i>

01:34:02.787 --> 01:34:04.038
- Reverend Toller, come on in.
- Hey.

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:05.998
Close the door.

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:08.708
Why don't you take a seat?

01:34:12.838 --> 01:34:14.214
We're concerned about you.

01:34:15.424 --> 01:34:16.341
Who is?

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.717
How's your health?

01:34:20.262 --> 01:34:21.596
Well, I'm having some tests.

01:34:22.639 --> 01:34:24.766
Hmm? Have you gotten your results?

01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:25.767
No. No.

01:34:26.893 --> 01:34:28.061
What about your diet?

01:34:28.645 --> 01:34:30.897
You know, I'm gonna be honest,
you just don't look so good.

01:34:32.232 --> 01:34:33.150
I've had some...

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.111
some stomach issues.

01:34:38.113 --> 01:34:39.905
And I understand you've been drinking.

01:34:41.782 --> 01:34:44.326
Hm. What?

01:34:45.244 --> 01:34:46.704
It's just a little wine with dinner.

01:34:46.787 --> 01:34:48.205
- Wine?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:34:49.915 --> 01:34:50.833
Well...

01:34:51.917 --> 01:34:55.504
that's not recommended
for someone who has stomach problems.

01:34:55.588 --> 01:34:56.839
I understand, all right?

01:34:56.922 --> 01:34:58.591
I'll start taking better care of myself.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.218
You're always in the Garden.

01:35:02.178 --> 01:35:05.598
Even Jesus wasn't always in the Garden

01:35:05.681 --> 01:35:07.349
on his knees, sweating blood.

01:35:08.267 --> 01:35:09.351
He was on the mount.

01:35:10.019 --> 01:35:13.521
He was in the marketplace.
He was in the temple.

01:35:13.605 --> 01:35:16.816
But you, you're always in the Garden.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.903
For you, every hour is the darkest hour.

01:35:20.612 --> 01:35:23.114
I wasn't aware that I had offended.

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.909
Jesus doesn't want our suffering.

01:35:25.992 --> 01:35:27.660
- He suffered for us.
- Mmm-mmm.

01:35:28.244 --> 01:35:31.664
He wants our commitment and our obedience.

01:35:31.748 --> 01:35:32.999
And what of His creation?

01:35:33.583 --> 01:35:35.418
The Heavens declare the glory of God.

01:35:35.502 --> 01:35:36.836
God is present everywhere,

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:41.257
in every plant, every river,
every tiny insect.

01:35:41.341 --> 01:35:45.385
The whole world is a manifestation
of his holy presence.

01:35:45.469 --> 01:35:48.805
I think this is an issue
where the church can lead.

01:35:48.889 --> 01:35:50.682
But they say nothing.

01:35:50.766 --> 01:35:51.767
The...

01:35:53.352 --> 01:35:55.812
the U.S. Congress
still denies climate change?

01:35:57.231 --> 01:35:59.650
Where were we when these people were elected?

01:36:00.275 --> 01:36:03.779
The... we know who spoke
for big business. Right?

01:36:03.862 --> 01:36:05.572
But who spoke for God?

01:36:08.325 --> 01:36:13.622
"The creation waits in eager expectation
of liberation from bondage."

01:36:15.957 --> 01:36:18.626
That's Romans 8:23. You understand?

01:36:20.002 --> 01:36:22.672
So we should pollute so God can restore?

01:36:23.089 --> 01:36:25.424
We should sin so God can forgive?

01:36:25.508 --> 01:36:27.718
I don't think that's what the apostle meant.

01:36:27.802 --> 01:36:29.303
I think we're supposed to look

01:36:29.387 --> 01:36:32.223
with the eyes of Jesus into every living...

01:36:32.306 --> 01:36:33.724
You don't live in the real world.

01:36:33.808 --> 01:36:35.226
- I...
- You don't.

01:36:35.309 --> 01:36:38.854
You are a minister
at a tourist church that no one attends.

01:36:38.938 --> 01:36:42.400
Do you have any idea what
it takes to do God's work?

01:36:42.483 --> 01:36:46.695
- I'm trying to...
- To maintain a mission of this size?

01:36:46.778 --> 01:36:49.155
The staffing, the outreach,

01:36:49.239 --> 01:36:51.491
the amount of people that we touch each day.

01:36:52.826 --> 01:36:54.828
Who's that priest that you like so much?

01:36:56.121 --> 01:36:57.831
- Thomas Merton?
- Thomas Merton.

01:36:57.914 --> 01:36:59.791
- He didn't live in the real world either.
- Yes, he did!

01:36:59.874 --> 01:37:01.293
- No. He was a monk who lived...
- He would...

01:37:01.376 --> 01:37:03.962
...in a monastery in Kentucky
and wrote books!

01:37:04.045 --> 01:37:06.047
Well, somebody has to do something!

01:37:06.464 --> 01:37:08.341
It's the earth that hangs in the balance.

01:37:08.425 --> 01:37:11.636
Well what if this is His plan?
What if we just can't see it?

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.097
You think God wants to destroy His creation?

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.350
He did once. For 40 days and 40 nights.

01:37:26.317 --> 01:37:30.154
Look, Abundant Life, we're with you.

01:37:30.237 --> 01:37:31.405
Okay, we care.

01:37:32.489 --> 01:37:33.490
We do.

01:37:33.574 --> 01:37:38.829
And I know this is a hard time for you,
but we're gonna help you with that.

01:37:39.997 --> 01:37:42.458
Once we get through
the reconsecration service,

01:37:42.541 --> 01:37:44.460
you need to go to rehab.

01:37:45.044 --> 01:37:48.005
You need to go check yourself
into a medical institution.

01:37:48.922 --> 01:37:53.760
All right, maybe go to Nicaragua
and preach the gospel or build houses

01:37:53.843 --> 01:37:56.304
but do something in the real world.

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:59.766
And if you can't do the ceremony,
I'll understand that.

01:37:59.849 --> 01:38:03.436
You're expected to be there, but look, we can
just say that you were sick, which is true.

01:38:03.519 --> 01:38:05.938
No, it's not... it's not about the ceremony.

01:38:06.022 --> 01:38:07.398
All right? I can... I will...

01:38:07.482 --> 01:38:09.484
I want to be there. I have to be there.

01:38:09.567 --> 01:38:12.153
It's my church. It's 250 years.

01:38:12.236 --> 01:38:15.031
I want to be there.
I want to introduce you. Please?

01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:21.662
Well, Ed Balq has decided
that he would like to make comments,

01:38:21.745 --> 01:38:23.372
so the governor will introduce him.

01:38:23.997 --> 01:38:25.624
- Will that be a problem?
- Not at all.

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:27.751
Not at all.

01:38:28.543 --> 01:38:30.128
Well, good. Good.

01:38:32.047 --> 01:38:34.466
Listen, we'll get
through this reconsecration.

01:38:34.549 --> 01:38:35.926
It'll be special.

01:38:36.718 --> 01:38:39.429
And then we'll deal with these other issues.

01:38:45.102 --> 01:38:46.144
Thank you.

01:39:42.866 --> 01:39:43.867
Thanks.

01:42:42.205 --> 01:42:45.542
- Where is Reverend Toller?
- I'm not sure, ma'am. Inside.

01:44:12.292 --> 01:44:13.419
- Have you seen him?
- No.

01:44:27.016 --> 01:44:28.517
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:44:41.697 --> 01:44:42.780
Toller!

01:44:46.124 --> 01:44:47.785
Toller, you in there?

01:45:13.644 --> 01:45:14.811
Begin the service.
