            of a change of diet,

17:12.198 --> 17:14.031
           and it did smell like
             roast lamb, and...

17:14.067 --> 17:15.566
   Oh. Okay.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.169
But promise me you won't eat
it unless there's absolutely

17:18.204 --> 17:19.236
nothing else around.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.405
And don't overcook it.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.441
             I'll check with you
              every three hours.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.041
I'll be here.
                 You'll be here.
                      Okay.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.683
Your friend is a good man.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.220
                    Yeah.
                 None better.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.622
It will be hot out there.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.790
      If you like,

17:39.825 --> 17:42.826
I could make a cooling shower
      of rain for him.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.296
          I'd like to put him
      in an air-conditioned car.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.930
                Now stop that.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.199

                 on his own,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.100
     otherwise the whole mission
           is for nothing.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.369
        No.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.905

          to suffer...

    you gained five pounds.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.998
Well, then why tell him?

21:42.034 --> 21:44.167

   poor kids out in that desert,

21:50.643 --> 21:52.409

           as well as I did.

Oh. Is it any wonder
    I love you?

Well, doc, he may be in better

but I'll bet
I'm in better mental shape.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.058
 Blisters this big.
That's what happened.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.460
Boy, you try walking
    on a desert,

22:09.495 --> 22:10.827
you'll have blisters too.

22:10.862 --> 22:13.130
Only come to think about it,
     you couldn't have,

22:13.165 --> 22:14.798
because you didn't
  have any shoes

22:14.833 --> 22:16.166

    them and...

 out a way of telling you, doc.

from the drop zone

and looking like the guest of
honor at the gourmet's club.

22:36.655 --> 22:37.921
              Explain that, pal.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.789
          How come you didn't
      let me in on the easy way?

22:39.825 --> 22:41.425
       I wanted to, Roge,
        but I couldn't.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.792
  I-- Well, what I mean is...

22:42.828 --> 22:44.428
                         What?
                         What?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.463
    Well, while you were out
       collecting cactus

22:46.499 --> 22:48.532
    and bones and feathers,
            I was...

22:48.567 --> 22:50.900
             I was having
      a big meal of chicken soup

22:50.936 --> 22:52.136
       and roast lamb and melon,

22:52.171 --> 22:54.671
       and there, I was lying
    in this beautiful silk tent.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.707
     No fair. No fair.
That's my mirage he's doing.

       No beautiful girl?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.212
There was in my mirage.

23:02.248 --> 23:03.880
    Well, after I ate the melon,
             you see...

23:03.915 --> 23:05.081
Doc, don't listen to him.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.950
Aside from what was
out there on the ground,

23:06.985 --> 23:08.619
the only thing he ate
was his left shoe.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.420
     It was my right shoe,
      and I didn't eat it.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.921
                Remarkable.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.590
               And the 75 miles?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.191
    I rode most of the way.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.192
On a camel?
              Yes.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.694
That was my mirage too.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.496
I must have told him
on the walkie-talkie.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.497
              Of course you did.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.866
  You saw it, but he rode it.

23:22.902 --> 23:23.867
       Very interesting.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.736
Wait a minute.
  Wait, doc.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.037
You don't believe him, do you?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.305
                  Of course not.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.307
         But the important thing
         is that he believes it.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.842
      A remarkable manifestation
         of mind over matter.

23:32.878 --> 23:35.945
   You see, Captain Nelson was
so convinced the food was there,

23:35.981 --> 23:38.415
      he not only put on weight,
           he got the gout.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.483
          And as for your camel,

23:39.518 --> 23:41.217
    he got the saddle sores.
