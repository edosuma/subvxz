01:26.962 --> 01:29.422
I believe in the Church of Baseball.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.925
I've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.345
I've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu,

01:36.388 --> 01:39.807
Siva, trees, mushrooms
and Isadora Duncan.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.934
I know things.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.188
For instance, there are 108 beads
in a Catholic rosary

01:45.272 --> 01:48.357
and there are 108 stitches in a baseball.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.902
When I learned that,
I gave Jesus a chance.

01:52.112 --> 01:56.866
But it just didn't work out between us.
The Lord laid too much guilt on me.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.286
I prefer metaphysics to theology.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.413
You see, there's no guilt in baseball

02:02.498 --> 02:06.250
and it's never boring,
which makes it like sex.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.377
There's never been a ballplayer
who slept with me

02:09.420 --> 02:11.964
who didn't have
the best year of his career.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.593
Making love is like hitting a baseball,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.012
you just gotta relax and concentrate.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.308
Besides, I'd never sleep
with a player hitting under .250

02:22.392 --> 02:26.395
unless he had a lot of RBI's or was
a great glove man up the middle.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.819
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom I give these boys.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.154
I can expand their minds.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.156
Sometimes when I've got
a ballplayer alone

02:37.241 --> 02:40.535
I'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.038
And the guys are so sweet,
they always stay and listen.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.792
Of course, a guy will listen
to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

02:48.961 --> 02:52.630
I make them feel confident,
and they make me feel safe

02:53.340 --> 02:54.757
and pretty.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.261
Of course, what I give them
lasts a lifetime.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.514
What they give me lasts 142 games.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.642
Sometimes it seems like a bad trade,

03:04.726 --> 03:06.936
but bad trades are part of baseball.

03:06.979 --> 03:11.148
Who can forget Frank Robinson
for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?

03:11.316 --> 03:14.402
It's a long season, and you gotta trust it.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.279
I've tried them all, I really have.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.031
And the only church
that truly feeds the soul

03:19.116 --> 03:22.660
day in, day out, is the Church of Baseball.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.532
Hey, Skip, that Max, hell of a guy.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.160
Where's Ebby?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.120
Ain't he warming up yet?

04:06.163 --> 04:09.707
No. His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.043
Better find our "bonus baby."

04:13.045 --> 04:15.796
- Have you seen Ebby?
- No.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.181
Ebby!

04:28.018 --> 04:30.144
Jesus.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.606
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.732
I am warm.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.902
Jesus, Ebby, this is your
professional debut tonight.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.030
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.200
You're leaving your fastball in
the locker room for some piece of ass.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.369
Skip, it is me.

04:46.453 --> 04:50.539
I am not some, quote,
"piece of ass," unquote.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.042
Oh, Millie.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.253
Jeez, sorry. Didn't recognize you.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.800
Don't take this personal, Millie,
but if I catch you in here again

05:00.884 --> 05:02.426
you're banned from the ballpark.

05:02.511 --> 05:06.639
You can't ban me from the ballpark
'cause my daddy donated that scoreboard.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.934
And if you ban me,
he just might take that scoreboard away.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.311
What do we need a scoreboard for?

05:12.396 --> 05:14.563
We ain't scored any runs all year.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.024
Now you get your ass out there!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.901
Hey, boss, I got a question.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.444
What?

05:20.529 --> 05:22.780
You think I need a nickname?
I think I need a nickname.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.157
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.535
Like "Oil Can," "Catfish."
What was the one you were...

05:27.577 --> 05:28.744
"Pokey."

05:28.787 --> 05:30.579
What do you think of "Pokey"?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.249
You got three minutes.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.210
Goddamn, son of a bitching,
motherfucking shithead!

05:36.837 --> 05:38.254
Time for another quickie.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.007
Jesus, you got a game to pitch.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.134
We got three minutes.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.606
Come on, folks.
Let's hear it for Max Patkin,

05:57.691 --> 05:59.775
the clown prince of baseball.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.902
You gonna sit there all day?

06:01.945 --> 06:04.113
And now, "The Greatest Show on Dirt,"

06:04.197 --> 06:07.158
your own Durham Bulls!

06:12.289 --> 06:15.124
I'm there. I'm ready.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.505
And now WRDU radio presents

06:21.590 --> 06:24.091
the voice of the Durham Bulls,
Teddy Garland.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.927
The Bulls off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.722
But hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut

06:29.806 --> 06:33.642
of heralded young pitcher,
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.481
Millie, you gotta stay
out of the clubhouse.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.899
You're gonna get everybody in trouble.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.817
I got lured.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.320
You did not get lured.
Women do not get lured.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.530
They are too strong and powerful for that.
Now say it,

06:46.615 --> 06:49.575
"I did not get lured. I accept full
responsibility for my actions."

06:49.659 --> 06:52.870
"I did not get lured. I accept full
responsibility for my actions."

06:52.954 --> 06:56.707
That's better. Okay. Now...
You got your radar ready?

06:56.792 --> 06:58.667
- Ready.
- Go to it.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.090
Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox
is leadoff hitter Willie Foster.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.258
Word on LaLoosh is that
the good-looking, young pitcher

07:06.343 --> 07:10.096
has a major-league fastball, but
sometimes has problems with his control.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.028
Oh, my. Damn.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.615
One ball, no strike to Willie Foster.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.789
No problem! No problem!

07:36.873 --> 07:39.792
Go get 'em, one, two, three, babe.
Get 'em, big guy.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.753
Ninety-five miles an hour.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.381
That's great. He looks just great.

07:53.807 --> 07:58.394
Stepping in for the Peninsula
White Sox, second baseman Allen Powley.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.812
What's it say?

07:59.896 --> 08:03.399
It says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.404
Scotty, baby, take this to Ebby Calvin.

08:09.906 --> 08:14.034
All right, honey, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.453
Well, he fucks like he pitches.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.206
Sort of all over the place.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.108
My!

08:55.493 --> 08:57.036
He walked 18.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.205
A new league record.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.417
- Struck out 18.
- Another new league record.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.794
In addition, he hit the sportswriter,

09:05.837 --> 09:08.964
the public address announcer,
the Bull mascot twice.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.800
Also, new league records.

09:13.220 --> 09:18.599
But, Joe, this guy's got some serious shit.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.519
- Yeah, serious shit. Yes.
- Yeah.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.237
Who are you? Who's he?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.822
I'm "the player to be named later."

09:34.115 --> 09:37.326
Crash Davis? I'm Joe Riggins.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.454
And you, Larry Hockett,
should recognize me

09:40.497 --> 09:43.666
'cause five years ago in the Texas League

09:43.750 --> 09:46.835
you were pitching for El Paso,
I was hitting clean-up for Shreveport.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.005
You hung a curveball
on an 0-2 pitch in a 3-2 game

09:50.090 --> 09:53.801
in the bottom of the eighth,
and I tattooed it

09:54.386 --> 09:56.887
over the Michelin tire sign, beat you 4-3.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.889
I remember. I should have thrown a slider.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.891
Damn, Crash, how you doing?

10:00.976 --> 10:03.269
I'm too old for this shit.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.355
Why the hell am I back in A ball?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.817
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.777
Big club's got 100 grand in him.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.738
He's got a million-dollar arm
with a five-cent head.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.116
Had a gun on him tonight.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.452
Last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.248
He's got the best young arm
I've seen in 30 years.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.041
You've been around.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.419
You're smart. You're a professional.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.630
We want you to mature the kid.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.383
We want you to room with him
on the road.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.469
Stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.598
Yeah? Where can I go?

10:41.850 --> 10:45.352
You can keep going to the ballpark
and keep getting paid to do it.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.105
Beats the hell out of working at Sears.

10:48.189 --> 10:52.401
Sears sucks, Crash.
I once worked there. Sold Lady Kenmores.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.403
Nasty... Nasty work.

10:55.238 --> 10:58.991
Even if it is the Carolina League
this is a chance to play every day.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.410
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.494
No.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.246
Well, my AAA contract gets bought out

11:04.331 --> 11:06.915
so I can hold the flavor-of-the-month's
dick in the bus leagues.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.835
Is that it? Fuck this fucking game!

11:19.262 --> 11:22.431
I fucking quit, all right? I quit.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.076
Who we play tomorrow?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.788
Winston-Salem. Batting practice, 11:30.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.294
So, how's it feel to get
your first professional win?

11:52.337 --> 11:55.589
It feels out there. It's a major rush.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.051
I mean, it doesn't just feel out there,
it feels out there.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.721
Kind of radical in a kind of tubular way,
you know.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.640
But most of all, it's out there.

12:04.724 --> 12:09.061
This is hopeless.
This is utterly, fucking hopeless.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.826
Hey, I'm Millie.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.830
- I'm Tony. I play second base.
- I know.

12:28.206 --> 12:32.000
Max, how do you just keep
coming back every year?

12:32.961 --> 12:36.171
'Cause I love the game, Annie. I love it.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.298
- Here you go.
- We didn't order these, honey.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.092
- He did.
- Who?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.010
The guy in the booth.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.099
Who's that?

12:47.892 --> 12:51.395
That's Crash Davis. Hey, Crash, come here.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.063
Come over here.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.900
He's kind of cute.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.403
He's played
in more ballparks than I have.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.821
Hell of a guy.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.698
He's really different.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.493
I actually saw him read a book
without pictures once.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.206
- Hi, Max.
- How you doing, Crash?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.876
Come over and sit down.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.336
I'm Crash.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.214
Annie Savoy. Wanna dance?

13:19.257 --> 13:20.716
I don't dance.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.676
How embarrassing.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.223
What is that?

13:41.362 --> 13:45.324
- Who's he dancing with?
- All of them, I think.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.923
You Annie Savoy?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.217
Thanks for your note. You're right.
I wasn't bending my back.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.803
- You got a live arm there.
- Thanks.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.306
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.099
You need a nickname, honey.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.268
You know, I've been
telling everybody that.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.605
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.941
She's dancing with me.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.151
Afraid not, pal.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.238
You boys gonna fight over little old me?

14:27.158 --> 14:28.951
- No.
- Let's go.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.161
Step outside and party, man.

14:34.249 --> 14:38.168
Don't be such guys. Max, let's dance.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.303
You coming or not, homeboy?

15:01.442 --> 15:04.486
Let's go, man. Come on. We're waiting.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.406
- Let's go, homeboy.
- Come on, Ebby. There he is.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.294
Look, I don't believe in fighting.
Let's just...

15:21.796 --> 15:25.507
That's really sweet. "I don't believe..."
Fuck you, you pussy.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.680
All right. Take the first shot at me.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.182
No way, man. I don't hit no man first.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.354
All right, then.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.567
Hit me in the chest with that.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.821
I'd kill you.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.449
Yeah? From what I hear,
you couldn't hit water

15:50.533 --> 15:52.534
if you fell out of a fucking boat.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.540
Throw it, man.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.418
Throw it, come on. Right in the chest.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.754
- No way.
- Come on, Meat.

16:03.838 --> 16:04.880
You're not gonna hit me

16:04.922 --> 16:07.716
'cause you're starting
to think about it already.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.260
Starting to think
how embarrassing it would be

16:10.345 --> 16:14.056
to miss in front of all these people,
how somebody might laugh.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.059
Come on, rook.
Show us that million-dollar arm

16:17.143 --> 16:21.813
'cause I got a good idea
about that five-cent head of yours.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.024
- Nail him, drop him.
- Hit him, man! Hit him!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.363
Fuck!

16:31.407 --> 16:32.574
Ball four.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.993
Who the fuck are you, man?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.084
Good punch.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.086
I'm Crash Davis. I'm your new catcher

16:44.170 --> 16:48.215
and you just got lesson number one,
don't think.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.842
It can only hurt the ball club.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.267
Come inside, I'll buy you a drink.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.943
He's my new catcher.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.582
We fight, she gets the clown.
How's that happen?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.127
God, I like this song.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.474
Did you boys stop fighting?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.643
Pals now?

17:41.686 --> 17:43.812
That's good.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.190
I love a little macho male bonding.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.234
I think it's sweet. I do.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.279
Even if it probably is latent
homosexuality being rechanneled.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.323
I'm all for rechanneling,
so who cares, right?

17:59.829 --> 18:02.080
Okay, shall we go to my place?

18:03.875 --> 18:07.961
- Which one of us?
- Both of you, of course.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.374
These are the ground rules.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.084
I hook up with one guy a season.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.545
Usually takes me a couple weeks
to pick the guy.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.964
It's kind of my own spring training.

18:53.049 --> 18:57.719
Well, you two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.598
So, I just thought we should kind of
get to know each other.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.683
Time-out. Why do you get to choose?

19:03.684 --> 19:05.227
Time-out. Why do you get to choose?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.063
- Why?
- Why do you get to choose?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.066
Why don't I get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

19:11.150 --> 19:15.070
Actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

19:15.363 --> 19:19.324
It's all a question of quantum physics,
molecular attraction and timing.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.245
There are laws we don't understand
that bring us together and tear us apart.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.831
It's like pheromones.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.708
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.379
You get 300 million of them,
they can build a cathedral.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.759
So is somebody gonna go to bed
with somebody or what?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.220
Honey, you are a regular
nuclear meltdown.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.097
You better cool off.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.560
Wait a minute. Where you going?

19:47.144 --> 19:50.230
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
I don't try out.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.023
Besides,

19:52.108 --> 19:56.069
I don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.697
What do you believe in, then?

19:59.198 --> 20:04.119
Well, I believe in the soul,
the cock, the pussy,

20:04.161 --> 20:06.246
the small of a woman's back,

20:06.289 --> 20:09.207
the hanging curveball,
high fiber, good Scotch,

20:09.292 --> 20:12.794
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.963
I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.299
I believe there ought to be
a constitutional amendment

20:17.341 --> 20:19.634
outlawing AstroTurf
and the designated hitter.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.010
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography,

20:20.011 --> 20:22.679
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography,

20:22.763 --> 20:25.390
opening your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve

20:25.474 --> 20:30.312
and I believe in long, slow, deep,
soft, wet kisses that last three days.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.065
Good night.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.442
Oh, my.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.694
Crash.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.363
Hey, Annie, what's all this molecule stuff?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.698
Crash.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.744
Crash, wait! All's I want is a date.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.079
I'm not gonna fall in love
with you or nothing.

20:48.164 --> 20:51.708
I'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in that boy.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.959
Good night.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.420
- I'm not interested yet.
- Who you calling a boy?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.130
See you at the yard, Meat.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.342
Damn, nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.636
He's crazy.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.262
I want you bad.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.148
Honey, hold on. Slow down.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.443
I wanna watch.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.698
Go ahead. Put it back on.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.577
Jesus, what kind of chick are you?

21:28.996 --> 21:32.374
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.210
I know how to pitch.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.587
Good.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.423
Now take it off slowly.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.271
That's nice.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.240
Oh, my, what a nice back.

22:06.909 --> 22:10.745
Honey. Sweetheart.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.456
Try taking off your shoes and socks first.

22:13.541 --> 22:16.084
My socks? It's cold in here.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.753
What?

22:18.796 --> 22:21.756
You think Dwight Gooden
leaves his socks on?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.081
Ebby, honey.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.128
Have you ever been tied up in bed?

23:30.785 --> 23:33.036
Bring it on, baby!

23:33.120 --> 23:34.996
I heard about shit like this.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.998
You ever heard about Walt Whitman?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.708
Who does he play for?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.835
He sort of pitches for
the Cosmic All-Stars.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.171
- Never heard of him.
- Oh, good.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.506
Listen to this.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.011
"I sing the body electric"

23:50.096 --> 23:53.973
"The armies of those I love engirth me
and I engirth them"

23:54.517 --> 23:57.852
"They will not let me off
till I go with them, respond to them"

23:57.937 --> 24:01.439
"And discorrupt them and charge them full
with the charge of the soul."

24:04.735 --> 24:09.572
"But the expression of a well-made man
appears not only in his face"

24:09.782 --> 24:12.450
"it is in his limbs and joints also."

24:12.535 --> 24:14.035
- Excuse me.
- "It is..."

24:15.538 --> 24:17.705
Are we gonna fuck or what?

24:20.042 --> 24:24.963
"It is curiously in the joints
of his hips and wrists"

24:25.214 --> 24:28.466
"love-flesh swelling and
deliciously aching."

24:28.551 --> 24:33.555
"Limitless limpid jets of love,
hot and enormous."

24:41.063 --> 24:44.399
Listen up, guys.
Can I have your attention a minute?

24:44.441 --> 24:46.776
I'm gonna be leading a daily chapel
service here in the locker room

24:46.861 --> 24:49.154
- at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- Amen, brother!

24:49.238 --> 24:52.407
Y'all are invited to stop on by
and worship before batting practice.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.285
Jimmy, God damn it.
Loosen up and get laid.

24:57.246 --> 25:02.959
I know y'all think I'm pretty square,
but I believe what I believe.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.424
Jesus, Ebby, you look like
a truck ran over you.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.636
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.931
Annie says it's my new nickname.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.601
Okay, Nuke. Go get 'em.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.895
Annie nailed you? Annie did?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.314
That's great. That means
you're gonna have a great year.

25:24.398 --> 25:28.776
Is she as good as they say?

25:30.487 --> 25:32.572
No, man, we didn't fuck.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.784
No, she read poetry to me all night.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.287
It's more tiring than fucking.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.711
"Limpid jets of love."

25:48.631 --> 25:52.675
Hey, Crash.
Does that mean what I think it means?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.302
"Limpid jets of love."

25:54.345 --> 25:56.971
Your shower shoes have fungus on them.

25:57.014 --> 26:01.267
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.937
Think classy, you'll be classy.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.688
If you win 20 in the Show

26:05.773 --> 26:08.316
you can let the fungus
grow back on your shower shoes

26:08.359 --> 26:10.610
and the press will think you're colorful.

26:10.653 --> 26:15.615
Until you win 20 in the Show,
however, it means you're a slob.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.829
Y'all don't forget

26:21.914 --> 26:25.041
Saturday is Bull Day
down at the Northgate Mall.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.794
Strike!

26:27.836 --> 26:30.880
Too bad, Butch. Too bad.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.341
Charge!

26:35.469 --> 26:38.137
Not getting that cheese by me, Meat.

26:38.389 --> 26:42.600
And now batting for the Bulls,
number eight, Crash Davis.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.028
Foul ball!

26:54.530 --> 26:56.698
God, stupid fuck, Crash.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.700
What'd you swing at a breaking ball for?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.076
Fuck me.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.166
You usually start me off with a hammer.

27:07.376 --> 27:11.337
You're thinking too much, Crash.
Get out of your fucking head.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.172
Don't let him in your kitchen.

27:13.215 --> 27:16.926
Come on, Crash. Just relax.
You got it, honey.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.637
All right, here we go. Stay back. Relax.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.556
Quick bat. Quick bat.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.766
Foul ball!

27:28.272 --> 27:32.066
Throw that shit again, Meat.
Throw that weak-ass shit again.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.902
Okay, he's got vision there.
Get close, baby, you got it.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.821
One more, baby, one more.
You got him.

27:37.448 --> 27:40.241
All right, he's gonna throw the deuce now.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.951
He's gotta waste one.

27:42.036 --> 27:45.621
Stay back and wipe
that silly grin off his face.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.333
Come on. Bring it. Bring it.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.168
Jesus Christ!

27:50.252 --> 27:52.253
What was that? What the hell was that?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.047
What goes around, comes around.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.965
Son of a bitch throws hard.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.928
It's okay, Crash. You take it easy, honey.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.056
Go, Crash!

28:03.307 --> 28:07.226
All right, one and two.
You can hit this shit. Relax.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.270
Annie. Annie.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.773
Annie. Who's this Annie?

28:11.982 --> 28:14.776
Jesus, get out of the box, you idiot.
Where's your head?

28:14.860 --> 28:16.611
Get the broad out of your head!

28:16.653 --> 28:18.279
- Time out!
- Time out!

28:21.283 --> 28:22.784
Give me a rag.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.330
Get a hit, Crash.

28:28.082 --> 28:29.248
Shut up.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.884
All right, you've seen all his pitches.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.803
You've seen them all.

28:41.887 --> 28:46.224
Shorten up, Crash. Bring me the gas, kid.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.767
Bring me the gas.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.227
Bring me the gas.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.147
Quick bat. Quick bat. Quick bat.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.816
Strike!

29:00.155 --> 29:03.032
Scotty, baby, take this to Crash.

29:04.076 --> 29:07.412
Folks,
we have a little lost girl up here.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.832
Says her name is Lana Ann Baker.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.501
- She'll be waiting...
- It's for Crash.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.378
At the ticket box
for her daddy, Cedar Baker.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.672
- Cedar, come on and get your little girl.
- Crash.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.216
- What?
- From Annie.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.634
Read it.

29:25.347 --> 29:30.643
"Dear Crash, you have a lovely swing but
you're pulling your hips out too early."

29:30.686 --> 29:34.605
"I'd be happy to meet with you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it."

29:34.690 --> 29:36.274
Signed, "Annie."

29:37.192 --> 29:39.861
If there's one chick who'd know
you were pulling your hips out early

29:39.945 --> 29:41.487
it'd be Annie.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.665
It's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.250
There you go.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.594
Here, Millie.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.179
What's it say?

30:07.389 --> 30:11.642
It says, "I wanna make love to you. Crash."

30:12.144 --> 30:13.436
Oh, my.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.822
- See my hips?
- Yep.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.785
And I think Susan Sontag is brilliant.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.789
Is this gonna happen? Us?

30:36.084 --> 30:38.711
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.

30:41.215 --> 30:43.799
You had your chance the other day.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.676
What is it you see in this guy?

30:45.802 --> 30:49.388
He's a young, wild,

30:49.932 --> 30:51.724
dim pretty boy.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.894
Young men are uncomplicated.

30:54.937 --> 30:58.940
And he's not dim. He's just inexperienced.

30:59.775 --> 31:04.904
It's my job to give him life wisdom
and help him get on to the major leagues.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.490
That's funny, that's my job, too.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.784
Damn!

31:11.662 --> 31:12.828
You're pulling your hips.

31:12.913 --> 31:16.832
I know.
I know, I know, but they're nice hips.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.502
- I looked up your records.
- You what?

31:19.586 --> 31:22.463
You hit 227 home runs in the minors.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.967
- That's not bad.
- Don't tell anybody.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.885
Why not? You hit 20 more this year

31:27.970 --> 31:29.929
you're gonna be the all-time
minor-league champ.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.556
The record's 246.

31:31.640 --> 31:37.770
Well, 247 home runs in the minor-leagues
would be a kind of dubious honor.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.481
I think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know about it.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.985
No. Just no. Please.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.487
Okay.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.951
Last chance, your place or mine?

31:52.244 --> 31:55.162
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics

31:55.205 --> 31:59.041
I am, within the framework
of the baseball season, monogamous.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.837
- Give me a break.
- It's true.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.088
Stop it.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.343
Jeez, the fact is

32:09.386 --> 32:11.887
you're afraid of meeting a guy like me,
'cause it might be real

32:11.972 --> 32:15.891
so you sabotage it with some,
what is it, bullshit

32:15.976 --> 32:18.894
about commitment to a young boy
you can boss around.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.689
- That's a great deal.
- Nice.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.524
I know women like you.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.152
I know women like you.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.779
You're a regular patron saint, you know.

32:28.864 --> 32:32.033
Stray cats, lost causes

32:32.117 --> 32:35.578
"or 6'3" homeless studs.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.873
Oh, Crash, you do make speeches.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.427
My!

32:54.514 --> 32:56.682
Crash, that was fabulous.

32:58.685 --> 32:59.894
Crash?

33:01.063 --> 33:03.898
You mean Nuke. You said, "Crash."

33:05.609 --> 33:10.196
No, honey, I said, "Nuke."

33:10.238 --> 33:12.782
- You said, "Crash."
- Oh, no.

33:13.283 --> 33:15.409
Listen, sweetheart,
you shouldn't listen to what a woman says

33:15.494 --> 33:18.621
when she's in the throes of passion.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.915
They say the darndest things.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.750
Yeah, you said, "Crash."

33:24.378 --> 33:25.753
Honey,

33:26.296 --> 33:28.756
would you rather I'd be making love
to him using your name

33:28.799 --> 33:32.426
or making love to you using his name?

33:37.808 --> 33:39.934
Yeah, maybe you're right.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.607
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers

33:46.692 --> 33:49.694
City Council Little League Cash Drop Day.

33:49.778 --> 33:54.073
These young fellas, young men,
I should say, over here to my left...

33:54.116 --> 33:57.118
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.661
Hey, Dino.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.959
Hey, Millie.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.132
Hey. I'm Millie.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.300
I'm married.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.643
- What is that?
- Chicken bone cross.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.313
Takes the curse off the bat
that brings me hits.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.192
What are you, a goddamn witch?

34:30.318 --> 34:33.320
Yes, a switch-hitting witch.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.699
Will that work for me?

34:36.783 --> 34:38.784
If you believe in voodoo.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.620
Jose, I am zero for 16.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.873
A big fucking donut hole for 16.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.500
I can't remember the last time
I had a base hit.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.377
Come on, man.
Let me have some of that stuff.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.005
Man, that is not belief.
That's desperation.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.341
Jose, come on. Just touch my bat once.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.179
Come on, just once.
I won't bother you the rest of the day.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.181
I swear to God. Just touch the bat once.

35:00.265 --> 35:04.435
Ladies and gentlemen,
five, four

35:04.519 --> 35:08.022
three, two, one.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.691
Let her go!

35:10.734 --> 35:13.819
One thousand big ones!

35:27.334 --> 35:29.794
That batter ain't nothing.
Come on, Nuke.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.555
Cut it!

35:44.059 --> 35:45.267
Time-out.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.520
Let's play ball! Let's go!

35:48.063 --> 35:50.397
Stay there. Give me the ball.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.525
Hey.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.820
Relax, all right?

35:55.904 --> 35:58.405
Don't try to strike everybody out.

35:58.448 --> 36:01.742
Strike-outs are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.911
Throw some ground balls.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.871
It's more democratic.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.707
What's this guy know, anyway?

36:08.750 --> 36:11.794
If he's so great, how come he's
been in the minors for 10 years?

36:11.878 --> 36:14.088
If he's so hot, how come
Annie wants me instead of him?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.214
Oh, hey.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.551
And another thing, Meat,
you don't know shit. All right?

36:18.593 --> 36:20.761
You wanna make it to the Show,
you'll listen to me.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.139
Annie only wants you
'cause she can boss you around. Got it?

36:25.267 --> 36:27.017
Relax. Let's have some fun out here.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.228
This game's fun, okay?

36:29.271 --> 36:31.355
Fun, God damn it.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.108
And don't hold the ball so hard, okay?

36:34.150 --> 36:37.111
It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.

36:40.699 --> 36:44.785
What's he know about fun?
I'm young. I know about fun.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.621
Old man, he don't know nothing about fun.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.957
All right. Nobody's gone out there.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.879
Why's he calling for a curveball?

36:55.797 --> 36:57.381
I wanna bring heat.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.802
Shake him off. Throw what you want.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.142
God damn it. Time-out.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.937
Hey, why you shaking me off?

37:12.939 --> 37:15.649
I wanna bring the heater.
Announce my presence with authority.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.152
- To announce your what?
- Announce my presence with authority.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.112
"To announce your fucking presence
with authority?"

37:20.155 --> 37:22.531
This guy's a first-ball fastball hitter,
he's looking for heat.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.075
Oh, yeah? So what. He ain't seen my heat.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.497
All right, Meat. Give him your heat.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.419
Why is he always calling me Meat?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.421
I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.549
Fastball.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.306
Come on, Nuke. Settle down.
Settle down, boy. Take your time.

37:58.026 --> 38:01.779
Home run for Burt Crook
of the Fayetteville Generals.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.782
What are you doing? What are you doing
standing here? I gave you a gift.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.868
You stand here showing up my pitcher?
Run, dummy!

38:10.789 --> 38:12.456
Give me the ball.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.795
Well, he really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.881
- I held it like an egg.
- And he scrambled the son of a bitch.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.633
Look at that. He hit the fucking bull.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.635
Guy gets a free steak.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.515
- You having fun yet?
- Oh, yeah, I'm having a blast, thanks.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.724
Good.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.728
Sucker teed off on that like he knew
I was gonna throw a fastball.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.398
- He did know.
- How?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.233
I told him.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.653
One down now!

38:42.904 --> 38:46.323
Come on, Nuke. You're the man.
No batter. Chuck hard, baby.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.784
Don't think, just throw.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.036
Don't think, just throw.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.922
Strike!

39:03.341 --> 39:06.093
God, that was beautiful. What did I do?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.853
Hang on, Millie. Here we go again.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.504
That's the first home run
of the year for Crash Davis.

39:42.589 --> 39:47.217
That brings the score up to
Fayetteville 14, Durham 2.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.971
Hell of a shot.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.807
Sorry it got wasted.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.936
I don't know what to do with these guys.

39:57.979 --> 40:01.732
I beg. I plead. I try to be a nice guy.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.859
- I'm a nice guy. But I don't...
- Scare 'em.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.987
They're kids. Scare 'em.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.741
That's what I'd do.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.744
Yeah.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.669
Everybody into the shower!

40:22.754 --> 40:26.381
Anybody ain't in this shower
in ten seconds gonna get fined $100.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.467
- Larry.
- One Mississippi,

40:28.510 --> 40:30.385
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,

40:30.470 --> 40:33.180
- four Mississippi...
- Get in there! Hurry it up!

40:33.264 --> 40:37.851
Seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi, ten Mississippi.

40:38.103 --> 40:43.273
You guys, you lollygag the ball
around the infield.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.901
You lollygag your way down to first.

40:46.194 --> 40:49.780
You lollygag in and out of the dugout.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.449
You know what that makes you? Larry.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.409
- Lollygaggers.
- Lollygaggers.

40:55.495 --> 40:58.122
- What's our record, Larry?
- Eight and 16.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.874
Eight and 16.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.211
- How'd we ever win eight?
- It's a miracle.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.754
It's a miracle.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.342
This is a simple game.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.679
You throw the ball.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.848
You hit the ball.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.892
You catch the ball.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.353
You got it?

41:22.438 --> 41:27.067
Now we have got a 12-day road trip
starting tomorrow.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.530
Bus leaves 6:00 in the morning.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.451
Goddamn, son of a bitching,
motherfucking shithead. God damn it!

41:40.415 --> 41:42.374
Yeah, Skipper, you wanted to see me?

41:42.417 --> 41:45.919
Yeah, Bobby. Shut the door.

41:55.722 --> 41:59.433
This is the toughest job a manager has.

42:00.268 --> 42:04.396
But the organization
has decided to make a change.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.481
They're releasing you from your contract.

42:06.566 --> 42:10.402
Skip, I know I'm in a goddamn slump,
but I hit the ball hard today.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.947
Couple flares drop in for me,
I'm right back in the groove.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.992
Sorry.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.212
Let's go. Come on.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.464
Nuke, honey.

42:31.216 --> 42:35.219
Let's go. Come on. We got five hours.
Hurry up. Five hour drive coming up.

42:38.306 --> 42:41.308
Honey, I want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.268
- What are they?
- They're garters.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.811
They're gonna hug your waist and snuggle

42:44.854 --> 42:47.564
and kind of dangle off your thighs
and buns in such a wonderful way.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.316
It'll help you see things differently.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.652
Plus, it'll remind you of me,
which is a lot nicer

42:51.694 --> 42:54.363
than thinking about all
those nasty hitters.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.907
Jesus, Annie, I don't know.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.992
You've been pitching
out of the wrong side of your brain.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.536
This will help put things
on the right side.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.997
Big-league pitchers don't use these.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.375
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

43:06.459 --> 43:09.795
Nuke. Nuke, excuse me.
Time to go to work.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.004
All right.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.806
Bye, y'all. Bye.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.224
Give me a break.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.560
Go get 'em, boys!
Hit them where they ain't.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.563
Stop it.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.732
Thank you.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.735
- What?
- It's not "woolly."

44:15.069 --> 44:17.279
Nobody gets "woolly."
Women get "weary."

44:17.363 --> 44:19.072
They don't get "woolly."

44:19.490 --> 44:21.825
Nobody's got "stress,"
they're wearing a "dress."

44:21.909 --> 44:24.870
God damn, I hate people
that get the words wrong.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.915
How come you don't like me?

44:29.042 --> 44:32.085
You don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

44:33.838 --> 44:36.882
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.760
- You got a gift.
- What do I got?

44:39.802 --> 44:42.262
You got a gift. When you were a baby,
the gods reached down

44:42.305 --> 44:44.514
and turned your right arm
into a thunderbolt.

44:44.599 --> 44:47.184
You got a Hall of Fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.895
I ain't pissing nothing away.
I got a Porsche already.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.397
I got a 911 with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.983
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

44:55.068 --> 44:56.985
What you need is a curveball.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.071
In the Show, everybody can hit a fastball.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.114
How would you know?

45:01.532 --> 45:03.617
You've been in the majors?

45:07.121 --> 45:08.955
Yeah, I've been in the majors.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.916
You were? Yeah?

45:10.958 --> 45:13.001
You've been in the Show, man?

45:13.795 --> 45:15.754
Yeah, I was in the Show.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.549
I was in the Show for 21 days once.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.429
Twenty-one greatest days of my life.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.391
You know, you never handle your luggage
in the Show.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.393
Somebody else carries your bags.

45:29.477 --> 45:31.186
It's great.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.814
You hit white balls for batting practice.

45:35.191 --> 45:36.983
Ballparks are like cathedrals.

45:39.654 --> 45:42.155
The hotels all have room service.

45:43.366 --> 45:46.576
The women all have long legs and brains.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.499
- They're really hot?
- Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

45:52.542 --> 45:55.085
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the Show.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.837
Exploding sliders.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.591
You could be one of those guys.

46:02.552 --> 46:05.720
Nuke could be one of those guys,
but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

46:05.805 --> 46:09.641
Listen, I am sick and fucking tired of you
calling me Meat.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.853
You wanna step outside?

46:12.895 --> 46:14.604
Yeah, I'll step outside.

46:14.689 --> 46:17.149
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, Crash!

46:17.191 --> 46:19.568
He was kidding. He was kidding.

46:21.863 --> 46:23.196
What's the problem?

46:23.239 --> 46:25.157
Crash, Crash. Nuke, what's happening?

46:25.199 --> 46:29.244
I was just gonna ask Crash to show me
how to throw a breaking ball.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.789
Good idea. Did anybody bring a ball?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.790
Good idea. Did anybody bring a ball?

47:10.244 --> 47:11.786
Double off the wall by Higgins.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.455
Once again,
the Durham pitchers are unable

47:13.539 --> 47:14.831
to get the first out of the inning.

47:36.646 --> 47:39.272
The Bulls will attempt to
end a six-game losing streak

47:39.357 --> 47:42.734
against the Greensboro Hornets
with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.121
Base hit to center field off LaLoosh.

48:01.754 --> 48:03.838
That closes the book on LaLoosh today.

48:03.923 --> 48:08.468
Five earned runs, five hits, five strikeouts,
five walks and five wild pitches.

48:09.345 --> 48:11.096
It's time to tell it
like it is, sports fans.

48:11.138 --> 48:14.641
And this is the most wretched
road trip I've seen in 20 years.

48:14.684 --> 48:17.477
And possibly the worst Durham team
in half a century.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.897
Is the modern-day athlete
a pale imitation of the great old warriors?

48:20.982 --> 48:23.149
Only Crash Davis stands out this year.

48:23.192 --> 48:25.360
Begging the question,
what are these boys thinking about?

48:25.444 --> 48:27.487
'Cause it sure ain't baseball.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.675
Hey, Mr. Hormone, check out this.

48:48.759 --> 48:52.012
Ice-skaters. God, look at them.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.180
Hey, fellas, that's what we need, man.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.017
One night with some of these skaters,
we can get right back on track.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.184
Yeah, right.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.687
Just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

49:00.730 --> 49:02.856
What we need is a rainout.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.524
I can get us a rainout.

49:04.567 --> 49:07.152
Man, there ain't been a cloud
in the sky in weeks.

49:08.946 --> 49:12.115
Hundred bucks says I can get us
a rainout for tomorrow.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.789
You're on.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.758
I ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

49:29.842 --> 49:32.135
Shut up. You're gonna wake everybody up.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.262
Let the bonus baby pay for it.

49:36.766 --> 49:38.308
Jesus, man.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.162
Crash, what are you doing?

50:08.422 --> 50:10.131
Oh, my goodness!

50:12.426 --> 50:15.136
We got ourselves a natural disaster.

51:57.990 --> 52:00.283
Hey, hey.

52:01.035 --> 52:02.660
- Wake up.
- Huh?

52:02.703 --> 52:04.704
You're awake.

52:04.747 --> 52:06.122
You're okay.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.209
You were dreaming.

52:11.504 --> 52:12.921
You're okay.

52:13.672 --> 52:16.049
I was playing damn near naked.

52:16.175 --> 52:19.010
- What?
- I was naked.

52:19.053 --> 52:20.678
Playing naked.

52:22.223 --> 52:23.515
I know.

52:24.391 --> 52:27.227
I know. I have that dream
all the time, too.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.438
We're almost home.

52:37.530 --> 52:39.614
Watch your head.

52:39.698 --> 52:42.200
Here you go. Let me get that black bag.

52:42.243 --> 52:45.411
- I'm not your slave.
- No, that one over there.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.463
Hi.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.279
God, I'm tired.

53:20.573 --> 53:22.115
What a trip.

53:23.033 --> 53:26.369
I was lousy. I was worse than lousy.

53:26.453 --> 53:30.999
I mean, every time I pitched,
it was like throwing gasoline on a fire.

53:35.754 --> 53:36.796
I mean, I...

53:36.881 --> 53:40.008
What is all this "I, I, I" stuff?
What about me?

53:40.092 --> 53:42.051
Aren't you glad to see me?

53:42.136 --> 53:44.178
Don't I look nice?

53:45.347 --> 53:47.682
You look great. I'm sorry.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.809
I'm just totally exhausted.

53:49.894 --> 53:53.146
Good. Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

53:54.023 --> 53:56.858
What you need is a good game of catch.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.318
Catch?

53:59.445 --> 54:02.155
Baby, come on. Fire one in here.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.657
This is ridiculous. I'm a professional.

54:04.742 --> 54:07.368
Will you just give it a try and lean in?

54:09.830 --> 54:10.997
Thank you.

54:12.166 --> 54:15.501
Now, I want you to breathe
through your eyelids.

54:15.544 --> 54:16.669
- My eyelids?
- Yeah.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.838
Like the lava lizards
of the Galápagos Islands.

54:18.881 --> 54:22.467
Some lizards have a parietal eye behind
their heads so they can see backwards.

54:22.509 --> 54:24.594
Haven't you ever noticed
how Fernando Valenzuela,

54:24.678 --> 54:27.555
he just doesn't even look when he pitches?

54:27.640 --> 54:29.682
He's a Mayan Indian.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.976
Or an Aztec. I forget which one.
I get them confused.

54:32.019 --> 54:34.062
- So do I.
- Stand up for a second.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.064
I want you to be aware
of the chakra connection

54:36.148 --> 54:37.982
between your feet and your testicles.

54:38.025 --> 54:41.152
- Chakra.
- Your right leg and left testicle

54:41.195 --> 54:43.029
and your left leg and your right testicle.

54:43.072 --> 54:45.698
- I like that.
- I bet you do.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.867
Give me the ball. Come on.
I'm tired of hearing this.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.869
Fire one in there. Come on.

54:50.704 --> 54:51.996
Okay.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.585
You're patronizing me,
and I will not be patronized.

54:57.670 --> 55:00.713
If I throw too hard, I'm
gonna hurt the girl.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.882
This girl has handled a lot of pitchers

55:02.967 --> 55:05.885
whose records are a lot better
than one and seven.

55:05.970 --> 55:09.389
- One and six. Give me the goddamn ball.
- Oh, sorry.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.232
- How do you like that?
- That was much better.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.567
Did you see that?
Because your delivery was fully integrated

55:21.652 --> 55:24.445
because you weren't thinking about it,
'cause you were pissed off at me.

55:24.530 --> 55:27.156
Now, that's progress. Come on up here.
Get your butt up here.

55:27.241 --> 55:29.033
Let's bend over, and I'm gonna show you...

55:29.076 --> 55:33.454
I give up. I give up. Let's go inside
and make love and fall asleep

55:33.539 --> 55:35.832
until it's time to go to the ballpark.

55:37.501 --> 55:41.587
Or we could just take
all that sexual energy

55:41.630 --> 55:44.757
and kind of hold onto it for a few hours

55:44.842 --> 55:48.261
and then rechannel it
into your pitching tonight.

55:50.764 --> 55:53.641
You're a powerful young thing,
Ebby Calvin.

55:56.645 --> 55:58.271
You want something
for that sore shoulder?

55:58.355 --> 56:00.940
Yeah, I want that shit
that don't smell bad.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.943
- It's on back order.
- Give him some of that shit.

56:17.124 --> 56:18.499
That's hot.

56:19.460 --> 56:21.753
No, I mean it, that's very hot.

56:23.505 --> 56:25.798
Annie says it'll keep one side of my brain

56:25.841 --> 56:29.093
occupied while I'm on the mound,
thus keeping my brain slightly off-center

56:29.136 --> 56:32.138
which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers.

56:33.348 --> 56:34.474
Okay.

56:36.602 --> 56:40.813
She also said I should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.275
Annie's a very smart lady.

56:47.654 --> 56:48.738
What?

56:51.950 --> 56:54.494
The rose goes in the front, big guy.

56:58.999 --> 57:03.461
Now batting for the Salem
Bucks, the center fielder, Joe McCorkle.

57:06.173 --> 57:08.424
This underwear feels kind of sexy.

57:09.635 --> 57:12.178
That don't make me queer, right? Right.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.018
Breaking ball.

57:23.565 --> 57:24.565
Yeah!

57:24.650 --> 57:27.110
All right! Good way to start, baby.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.989
I ain't queer. No, I ain't.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.746
Fastball.

57:42.334 --> 57:43.709
Strike!

57:44.670 --> 57:47.130
Ninety-six miles an hour. He looks good

57:47.214 --> 57:49.048
but why is he all twisting up like that?

57:49.133 --> 57:51.884
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

57:52.845 --> 57:54.387
Whoo, that was a humdinger.

57:55.597 --> 57:56.722
Yeah.

58:00.686 --> 58:02.395
Fastball again? Why's he want the heat?

58:02.437 --> 58:04.856
I just threw heat. Don't think, Meat.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.941
Just give them the gas.

58:10.779 --> 58:11.988
Strike!

58:13.407 --> 58:16.159
Jesus, what's got into Nuke?

58:16.243 --> 58:17.660
He's wearing garters

58:17.744 --> 58:20.997
and he's breathing out of his eyelids
like a lava lizard.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.623
It's an old Mayan deal.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.584
- Aztec.
- Aztec deal.

58:31.592 --> 58:33.885
Got it! I got it!

58:36.054 --> 58:38.139
Way to go. Hustle in!

58:41.101 --> 58:43.603
Have my mojo working.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.771
You know what a mojo is?

58:45.856 --> 58:47.440
- Sure.
- No, you don't.

58:48.192 --> 58:50.109
I was great, huh?

58:50.736 --> 58:53.446
Your fastball was up.
Your curveball's hanging.

58:53.488 --> 58:56.282
In the Show, they would have ripped you.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.493
Can't you even let me enjoy the moment?

58:59.578 --> 59:01.287
The moment's over.

59:04.625 --> 59:06.000
Come on, Crash.

59:06.084 --> 59:08.628
This guy starts me off with a breaking ball

59:09.880 --> 59:11.714
I'm taking him downtown.

59:18.096 --> 59:20.223
I dare you to throw me the hammer.

59:20.682 --> 59:22.141
You ain't that stupid.

59:22.184 --> 59:25.478
Stepping up to the plate
for Durham, our own Crash Davis.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.647
Come on.
Put your hands together for Crash.

59:27.731 --> 59:28.981
Let's hear it!

59:32.069 --> 59:33.236
Let's go.

59:33.320 --> 59:36.822
Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit.

59:36.865 --> 59:39.659
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

59:44.665 --> 59:46.749
Oh, my.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.717
Two-nothing Bulls in the second.

59:56.802 --> 59:59.887
First time the Bulls have been
ahead in weeks, eh, Whitey?

59:59.972 --> 01:00:02.682
Let's see if the real
Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.143
There you go! Dig in there!

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.446
Back! Back! Back!

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.448
Crash, you got room!

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.701
You got room!

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.123
All right, yeah!

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.585
What are you doing out here?
I'm cruising, man.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:34.171
I want you to throw
the next one at the mascot.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.424
Why? I'm finally throwing it
where I want to throw it.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.592
Just throw it at the bull, all right?

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.969
Trust me.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:44.807
He's the boss.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.564
A staggering start by LaLoosh.

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:54.900
He's thrown five outs on nine pitches,
all of them strikes.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:57.653
He's got pinpoint control
here tonight, Bull fans.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.071
Here's the pitch.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.207
This guy's crazy.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.294
Yep. I wouldn't dig in there if I was you.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.379
Next one might be at your head.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.966
I don't know where it's gonna go.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:20.551
I swear to God.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.612
You're the man! You're the man!
Easy game!

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.783
Top of the ninth. Two outs.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.411
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.415
Bring it on, Meat. Don't let up.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.292
You own these guys.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.629
Dad would love a shutout.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.260
No. No, no.

01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:08.599
No, no, he's looking for heat.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:10.476
Let me give him the deuce.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.978
Play ball!

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.148
Oh, no, he's shaking off the signs.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.566
Big mistake.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.027
This son of a bitch
is throwing a two-hit shutout.

01:02:20.112 --> 01:02:22.613
He's shaking me off. You believe that shit?

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.827
Charlie, here comes the deuce.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:30.496
And when you speak of me, speak well.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.838
- No, no. Serve it up.
- Yeah.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.515
Home run.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:51.851
Give me the ball.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.693
You told him I was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:01.944
Yep.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:06.115
Man, that ball got out of here in a hurry.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:10.244
Anything that travels that far ought
to have a damn stewardess on it.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.954
Don't you think?

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:52.244
When Nuke started listening to
Crash, everything fell into place.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:55.498
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:57.958
But Nuke was still confused.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.919
He was so encouraged by his victory

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.796
that he vowed not to have sex
until he lost.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.924
Unfortunately, however,
he kept on winning

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:07.218
and for one extraordinary June and July

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:13.015
the Durham Bulls began playing baseball
with joy and verve and poetry.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:17.478
The two sides of my own brain
were all jumbled up and cross-wired.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.522
While one side was being neglected

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:23.275
the other was in paradise watching
our Bulls play like big-leaguers.

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:27.279
We swept a four-game series at Kinston,
two games at Winston-Salem

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.616
and kicked the holy shit
out of Greensboro in a three-game set.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.660
And Crash, who kept hitting dingers

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:37.289
was approaching the minor-league record,
though I told nobody.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:43.629
After sweeping the July 4 doubleheader
the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:48.175
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
I was getting damn lonely.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.177
Something had to be done.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:52.054
I needed a man.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.189
Yeah!

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:04.441
I love winning, man.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.819
I fucking love winning.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:10.364
You hear what I'm saying?
It's like better than losing.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.618
Teach me something new. I need to learn.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.662
Teach me something.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.831
You got something to write with?

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.791
Good. It's time to work
on your interviews.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:23.252
My interviews? What do I gotta do?

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:25.379
You have to learn your clichés.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.882
You're gonna have to study them,
you're gonna have to know them.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.677
They're your friends. Write this down.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:35.598
We gotta play 'em one day at a time.

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:38.642
"Got to play..."

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.352
- It's pretty boring.
- Of course it's boring.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.729
That's the point. Write it down.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:45.357
"One day at a time."

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.193
I'm just happy to be here.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.696
Hope I can help the ball club.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.782
I know. Write it down.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:58.871
I just wanna give it my best shot.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:03.208
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:07.212
"Good Lord willing

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:10.007
- "things will work out."
- Things will work out.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.550
How's Annie?

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.931
She's getting pretty steamed, actually,

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:21.060
'cause I'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.148
I'm figuring I'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:28.734
You know, to calm her down.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.111
Are you out of your mind?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.572
- I'm just... Talking about one time.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:36.659
If you give in now, you might start losing.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:44.083
Never fuck with a winning streak.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.548
Hi, boys.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.927
Hi, darling. Get in here.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.804
Hey, Jimmy!

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.347
Want a ride?

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:03.686
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.312
No.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.107
Can I give you my testimony?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.318
You can do anything you want.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.449
Hop in.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.123
I am so proud of you guys.

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:32.297
- You want some more soup, honey?
- No, thanks. That was great.

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:39.513
How about a little back rub?

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.515
No, I'm okay.

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.809
I think I'll just take a little nap.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:45.811
You want me to tuck you in?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.230
Annie, you can't seduce me.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.943
Sweetie, I'm not gonna try to seduce you.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.741
- What's that?
- That's my leg.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.159
I know what it is.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.286
I thought maybe we could work
on some fundamentals

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:06.915
since we're not gonna make love,
and improve your hand-eye coordination.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.794
- My hand-eye coordination?
- Unsnap my stocking.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:17.384
The other day,
Crash called a woman's... pussy...

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:21.930
You know how the hair is kind of
in a V-shape?

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:23.932
Yes, I do.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.477
He called it the Bermuda Triangle.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.688
He said a man could get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:33.776
- What a nasty thing to say.
- He didn't mean it nasty.

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:39.156
He said that getting lost and disappearing
from the face of the earth

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:43.076
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:49.291
But he also said that there were times
for discipline and self-control.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.292
And I think this is one of those times.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.921
Crash is a very smart man.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.381
Now, honey, let's give it a try.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.555
Here, wait a minute. Watch. Watch.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.729
Now you try. Go ahead.

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.492
Yep.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.665
You're playing with my mind.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.291
I'm trying to play with your body.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.917
I knew it. You're trying to seduce me.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.962
Of course I'm trying to seduce you
for God's sake.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:38.090
I'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't I pretty?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.133
God, I think you're real cute.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:44.220
Cute? Baby ducks are cute. I hate cute!

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.640
I wanna be exotic and mysterious.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:51.728
You are.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.898
That's why I better leave.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.150
Nuke, you got it all wrong.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.570
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:01.280
- Ask Crash.
- I did.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.781
And what did he say?

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:05.784
He said, if I give into you,
I'll start losing again.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.829
- He did?
- Yeah.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.623
I'll be back when we lose.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.672
Damn it!

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.355
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.233
You are messing with my private life!

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.819
Knock-knock, you know? Come in.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.988
- Words like, thank you.
- You're confusing him.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.823
- You're bending his mind all out of shape.
- I'm what?

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.241
You're confusing him!

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:47.659
I'm confusing him?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:50.037
You got him breathing out
of the wrong goddamn eyelid.

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.331
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.375
That is a religious ritual
and it happens to be working,

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.501
if you don't mind my saying.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.338
Wait a second. Who dresses you?

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.839
- What?
- Who dresses you?

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:04.009
You think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.638
"The road of excess leads to
the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.681
- William Blake?
- William Blake.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.516
- William Blake?
- William Blake!

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.937
- What do you mean, "William Blake"?
- I mean, "William Blake."

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.400
Who are you? I mean, do you have a job?

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.612
I teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College,

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.448
English 101 and Beginning Composition.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.493
You know, having a conversation
with you is like...

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:33.163
Is like a Martian talking to a fungo.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.915
Oh, cute. That's really cute.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:37.042
Just because sometimes
you manage to be clever

01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.628
and have a nice smile,
does not mean you are not full of shit.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.630
- What, I'm full of shit?
- You are full of shit.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.423
- What, I'm full of shit?
- You are full of shit.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:46.051
- Nuke's chastity was your idea.
- I know! I'm telling you

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.886
- keep your hands out of this.
- I never told him

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.930
- to stay out of your bed.
- You most certainly did.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:51.848
- I never told him to stay out of your bed.
- Yes, you did.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:55.185
I told him that a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.561
- Fine.
- You know why?

01:11:56.604 --> 01:11:58.563
- 'Cause they don't happen very often.
- Right.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.899
If you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:04.528
or because you're not getting laid,
or because you wear women's underwear

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.572
then you are, and you should know that.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:15.872
Come on, Annie.
Think of something clever to say.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:21.586
Something full of magic,
religion, bullshit.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.589
Come on. Dazzle me.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.927
I want you.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.013
What?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.349
- I said, "I want you."
- Stop it.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.982
You're scared.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.780
Maybe I am.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.117
But I still think you should leave.

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.289
Okay. Well,

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.542
this is the damnedest season
I've ever seen.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:03.879
I mean, the Durham Bulls can't lose,
and I can't get laid.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.803
Come on.
Show them what you got, Super Nuke!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.473
Show them there, Super Nuke!
Super Nuke!

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:18.810
LaLoosh. L-A-Loosh! Come on, LaLoosh!
L-A-Loosh! L-A-Loosh!

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:22.647
Just relax out there. Don't aim the ball.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.195
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.447
Anything bothering him?

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:32.240
He says his chakras are jammed.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.701
He's having trouble breathing
out of his left eyelid.

01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:35.827
- Left eyelid?
- Right eyelid.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.120
Right eyelid.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.170
- Give me the ball.
- Fuck!

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.091
Time out!

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.510
Up to the plate,
Junior Chavley.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:52.969
What's wrong?

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:55.347
I'm a little nervous. My old man's here.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.724
Your dad's here? Where's he at?

01:13:57.809 --> 01:14:00.769
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look. Don't look.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.274
Look, he's waving.
Hey, he's just your old man.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.901
He's as full of shit as anybody.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.027
What's going on?

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.029
You breathing through
the wrong fucking eyelid again?

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.573
- Shut up.
- You guys hear about Jimmy and Millie?

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:16.701
They got engaged. Can you believe that?

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.746
Yeah? Wait till I tell him she's gone
down on half the Carolina League.

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:22.833
Anybody says anything bad about Millie,
I break his neck.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.377
Excuse me, guys.
I've got a game to pitch here.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.674
Hey, you guys. Don't throw me anything.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.300
My girlfriend put a curse on my glove.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.594
I'll take the hex off the fucking glove.
Give me the glove.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.972
You gotta cut the head off a live rooster.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.182
Guys! Play ball!

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:43.228
What the hell's going on out there?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:46.898
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they're gonna call the roll.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.819
- Get your ass out there and check it out.
- You bet.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:57.534
- Let's play some baseball!
- Hurry up!

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.705
Excuse me.
What the hell's going on out here?

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.415
Well, Nuke's scared

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.209
'cause his eyelids are jammed
and his old man's here.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.753
We need a live... Was it a live rooster?

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.256
We need a live rooster
to take the curse off Jose's glove

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.009
and nobody seems to know
what to get Millie or Jimmy

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.635
for their wedding present.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.180
That about right?
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.518
Okay, well,
candlesticks always make a nice gift.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.312
Maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.939
Maybe a place setting
or a silverware pattern's good.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:30.317
Okay, let's get to it. Go get 'em.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.612
Come on. Get your ass in gear.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.243
LaLoosh looks in
for the sign. Here's the pitch.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:43.079
Ball hit deep in the right
field, off the wall.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:45.081
You should be at the game, Annie.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.625
No, I'm fine.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.294
Beautiful night for baseball here
in Durham.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.629
And as the batter steps in...

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:54.883
How much time did you
and Jimmy spend together

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.135
before he proposed?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.304
About five hours, I guess.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.056
We both just knew.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.141
Once again, he goes to the rosin bag.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.434
Annie,

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:08.063
do you think I deserve to wear white?

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.649
Honey, we all deserve to wear white.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.942
Ball two, in the dirt.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.818
Come on, Nuke, go get them!

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:18.490
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:21.451
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:22.619
Come on!

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.287
He's coming. Go home! Home!

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.289
We got him! We got him!

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.585
- Safe!
- No, I got him!

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.587
- You missed him!
- I didn't miss him!

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:36.174
- Don't bump me!
- He still hasn't touched the plate!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.677
He still ain't touched the plate!

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:42.722
Fuck it! It's a cocksucking call!

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:45.225
- Did you call me a cocksucker?
- No, I...

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.852
I said it was a cocksucking call!
You can't throw me for that.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.063
- You can't run me for that.
- You missed the tag!

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:53.191
- You just spit on me!
- I did not spit on you!

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:56.361
You're in the wrong business!
You're Sears & Roebuck material!

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:58.905
You're pushing it, buddy!
You want me to run you out? I'll run you!

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:01.533
- You want me to call you a cocksucker?
- Go ahead. Try it.

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:04.995
Beg me! Pretty please, beg!
Pretty please, beg!

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.871
Call me a cocksucker,
and you're out of here!

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.373
You're a cocksucker.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.125
- You're a cocksucker.
- You're out of here!

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.418
Shit!

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:14.337
- What the fuck is that?
- Holy shit!

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:22.345
- He called me a cocksucker!
- He missed the tag!

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.681
I've never seen Crash so angry.

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:27.058
And frankly, sports fans,
he used a certain word

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.060
that's a no-no with umpires.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.606
Crash must have called
the guy a cocksucker.

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:36.735
Mmm. God, he's so romantic.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:42.532
When Crash got thrown out,
the game got out of hand.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:46.745
Jose made three errors
with his cursed mitt.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.165
Nuke never quite got in the groove,
though he didn't pitch bad

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:53.877
and the winning streak
came to an end with a 3-2 loss.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:57.672
The good news was that a man
was about to come calling.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:01.009
Bad news was it was the wrong guy.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.588
Annie.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.594
Annie.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.433
I know you're in there.
I can hear that crazy Mexican singer.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:57.816
We lost.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:18:59.818
It's okay.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:04.322
Oh, Annie, I'd like you to meet my father.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.698
Oh, my!

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:08.410
Ebby's told me a lot about you.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:12.789
Ebby tells me you taught him a lot
about discipline and self-control.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.458
We were worried that he might
get involved in the wrong crowd.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.669
We're so pleased
he met a Christian woman.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:19.170
Praise the Lord.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.674
Excuse me.

01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:24.134
Excuse me, Dad.

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:29.305
Hello? What?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.936
- We got a lot of catching up to do.
- Your father is right there.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.646
Crash tells me I gotta quit
worrying about him

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:39.399
so I think it's a good opportunity
to go for a quickie.

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.776
We gotta talk. We gotta...

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.361
Hello?

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:46.489
Yes, he most certainly is here.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.450
It's Skip for you.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:51.494
Hey, Skip, it's me.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.375
What?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.087
My God.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:05.258
Okay.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.386
Yeah. All right.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:10.263
What?

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.223
I'm going to the Show.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.606
Dad!

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.692
They're sending me up to the majors.
I leave first thing in the morning.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.402
Can you believe it?

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.031
Let's have
a quick word of prayer.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:29.741
Oh, let's not.

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:32.744
I gotta find Crash.
Come on. I'll dump you off.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:33.912
Wait.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:38.124
Not so fast. He'll be right with you.

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:41.669
Come on, sweetie.
I just want to have you alone for a second

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:44.214
so we can say goodbye.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:45.757
I'll be back.

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:48.301
When somebody leaves Durham,
they don't come back.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.969
I mean, later.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:54.432
Oh.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:01.814
Huh.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:08.530
Oh, God, Annie. Jeez.

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:14.702
- What do you have in there?
- Nothing.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.664
You're not going to
be needing these anymore.

01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:20.792
- I'd better take them.
- No, you're ready.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.545
You think so? You think I'm ready for this?

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:27.298
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh,

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:32.428
don't think too much.

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:36.391
I won't.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.146
You know something, Annie.

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:46.317
You can't breathe through your eyelids.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:49.153
Of course you can't breathe
through your eyelids.

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:52.323
Whoever told you such a ridiculous thing?

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.339
Now, get. Come on.

01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:14.220
Drive careful.

01:22:16.724 --> 01:22:18.308
Oh, my.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.367
Hey, there you are.

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:38.911
Crash.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:43.458
Hey, Crash, guess what.

01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:46.419
Guess what, man.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.048
I'm going to the Show.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.218
Big club's expanding its roster
to finish out the season.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:55.386
Nice shot.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.555
And I am going to the Show.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.767
So why don't you go then?

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:02.852
Let's celebrate!

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.064
Congratulations.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:09.692
Hope you end up on the cover
of Sports Illustrated

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.361
or maybe a cereal box.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.198
What's your problem, man?

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:17.617
I'm trying to thank you.
Come on. Let's get out of this dump.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.410
- I'll buy you a beer.
- Hey.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.247
- You calling my place a dump?
- No, he's not. No, he's not.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.250
- He's not. Are you?
- No.

01:23:26.293 --> 01:23:27.585
He's not.

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:29.420
All right?

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.214
Nuke, do you know who this is?

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.758
This is Sandy Grimes.

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:37.387
Sandy Grimes hit .371
in Louisville in 1967.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.597
.376.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.060
I'm sorry. He hit .376.
That's a career, man.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.981
- In any league.
- Got that right.

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:52.860
Did you hear what I said?
I'm going to the Show.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:57.198
You know what the difference
between hitting .250 and .300 is?

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.243
It's 25 hits.

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:05.289
Twenty-five hits
in 500 at-bats is 50 points. Okay?

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:08.084
There's six months in a season.
That's about 25 weeks.

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:11.462
That means if you get
just one extra flare a week. Just one.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.965
A gork. You get a ground ball.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:16.300
You get a ground ball with eyes.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:18.636
You get a dying quail.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:24.684
Just one more dying quail a week
and you're in Yankee Stadium.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.980
You still don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:30.982
Get the hell out of here.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.775
All right.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.861
Fuck.

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:37.071
Send you a postcard.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:39.157
Send me a postcard? Hey, I made it.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.658
You made it. You made shit.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.702
Hey! Hey!

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:46.998
You crazy?

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.916
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.961
- I'll be all right.
- I'm talking about my mirror.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.423
Shit, I'm sorry. Hey!

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.675
I'm not gonna fight you, man.
I'm not gonna fight you.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.761
What do you mean,
you're not gonna fight me, you fuck?

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:02.054
- Fuck. Why am I a fuck?
- Why are you a fuck?

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:03.723
Because you got talent.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.726
I got brains, but you got talent.

01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:11.314
See this right arm?
Worth a million bucks a year.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:14.108
All my limbs put together
aren't worth seven cents a pound.

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:16.027
What are you talking about?
You're a great catcher.

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:19.030
- I'm a great catcher?
- Yeah.

01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:20.656
- Forget it.
- Hey.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.700
- Fucking forget it.
- Hey, Meat.

01:25:25.913 --> 01:25:27.121
Damn!

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.917
I didn't mean to hit you, man.

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.463
You hurt my eye!

01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:39.133
Sorry.

01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:42.887
Did you hit me with your right hand,
did you hit me with your left?

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.642
Did you hit me with your right hand,
did you hit me with your left?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:50.269
- My left.
- Good. That's good.

01:25:50.354 --> 01:25:54.690
When you get in a fight with a drunk,
you don't hit him with your pitching hand.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.194
God, I can't keep giving you
these free lessons.

01:25:58.237 --> 01:26:00.738
So quit screwing around and help me up.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.205
You look great, man.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.218
Be careful with the bags.

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:25.221
We got a boy going to the Show.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.335
Sorry about last night.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.716
Forget it.

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:09.974
I have been known on occasion
to howl at the moon.

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.311
You understand?

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:19.817
No.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.028
Well, you will.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:25.781
Look, Nuke,

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:29.327
these big-league hitters are going
to light you up like a pinball machine

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.996
for a while, all right?

01:27:32.039 --> 01:27:33.956
Don't worry about it.

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.668
You be cocky and arrogant,
even when you're getting beat.

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.005
That's the secret.

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:47.219
You gotta play this game
with fear and arrogance.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:50.765
Fear and ignorance.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:56.729
No, fear and arrogance,
you hayseed, not ignorance.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.356
I know. I know.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:02.026
I just like seeing you get all worked up.

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:09.533
Listen.

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:14.580
Thanks.

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.224
Hey, Nuke.

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.395
Good luck.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:40.731
You too, Meat.

01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:03.212
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:05.256
You may kiss the bride.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:42.334
Jimmy, we all pitched in,
and we got you a little gift.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:43.502
Tony.

01:29:43.587 --> 01:29:46.756
Kind of a special wedding cake
from the Durham Bulls.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.303
Oh, my Lord!

01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:58.768
Yeah, Skip?

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:01.896
You wanted to see me?

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:06.108
Crash, shut the door.

01:30:11.073 --> 01:30:12.531
I wanna thank everyone!

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.366
Give me a piece of that!

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:29.507
This is the toughest job a manager has.

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.136
But...

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.642
The organization wants to make a change.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:45.731
Now that Nuke's gone,
they wanna bring up some young catcher.

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:48.192
Some kid hitting .300 in Bluefield.

01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:50.152
He's probably a bust.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:54.115
I put in a word for you
with the organization.

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:58.577
Told them I thought you might make
a fine minor-league manager someday.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:05.626
There might be an opening
at Visalia next year.

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:10.756
You had a hell of a year, Crash.

01:31:12.342 --> 01:31:13.551
But...

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:16.554
you know how it is.

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.847
I got released.

01:32:42.933 --> 01:32:44.475
I heard already.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:03.053
Oh, my.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:03.655
I think probably with my love
for four-legged creatures

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.617
and hooves and everything,
that in another lifetime

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:09.453
I was probably Catherine the Great
or Francis of Assisi.

01:35:09.496 --> 01:35:11.455
I'm not sure which one.

01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:14.458
What do you think, honey?

01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:21.006
How come in former lifetimes
everybody is somebody famous?

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.971
I mean...

01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:33.477
How come nobody ever says
they were "Joe Schmoe"?

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.855
Because it doesn't work that way,
you fool.

01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:47.449
God, you are gorgeous.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:51.870
You wanna dance?

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:08.262
Yes.

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.431
I guess you do.

01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:47.462
Crash took off at dawn.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:50.007
Said he heard there might be
an opening for a catcher in Asheville

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.092
in the South Atlantic League.

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:55.012
A woman should be
so strong and powerful

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:57.639
that she's not affected by such things.

01:38:57.974 --> 01:39:00.183
I mean, it wasn't the first time
I went to bed with a guy

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.311
and woke up with a note.

01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:05.355
At least the son of a bitch
left me breakfast.

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:12.195
You have to respect a ballplayer
who's just trying to finish the season.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.615
At least, that's what I told myself.

01:39:15.575 --> 01:39:18.827
Baseball may be a religion
full of magic, cosmic truth

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:21.997
and the fundamental ontological
riddles of our time,

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:24.207
but it's also a job.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:29.212
Come on, Meat.
Throw me that weak-ass shit.

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:32.591
Come on.
You ain't getting that cheese by me.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.720
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

01:39:37.764 --> 01:39:42.726
When Crash hit his 247th home run,
I knew the moment it happened.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.728
But I'm sure nobody else did.

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:48.565
And The Sporting News
didn't say anything about it.

01:39:49.942 --> 01:39:53.111
"Full many a flower is born
to blush unseen,

01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:57.324
"And waste its sweetness
on the desert air." Thomas Gray.

01:39:58.076 --> 01:40:01.411
Or William Cullen Bryant.
I don't know. I get 'em mixed up.

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:05.707
Anyway, my attempts at housekeeping
were feeble as usual.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.502
I sometimes get easily distracted.

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:12.172
Funny thing was
I stopped worrying about Nuke.

01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:14.800
Somehow I knew nothing would stop him.

01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:18.970
The world is made for people
who aren't cursed with self-awareness.

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:22.182
Crash was right, Nuke had a gift.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:26.228
I'm just happy to be here,
and I hope I can help the ball club.

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:28.313
You know, I just wanna
give it my best shot.

01:40:28.398 --> 01:40:30.524
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out.

01:40:30.608 --> 01:40:32.818
You know, you gotta play 'em
one day at a time, though.

01:40:32.902 --> 01:40:35.028
Raye Anne, right? That's a beautiful name.

01:40:35.113 --> 01:40:38.365
Is that Greek? Raye Anne.
It's a beautiful name.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.951
There's a great song by Motley Crue.
Do you know it?

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:43.370
"Raye Anne, she's a stay in." No?

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:45.539
Anyway, a good friend of mine
used to say,

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.499
"This is a very simple game."

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:50.127
"You throw the ball,
you catch the ball, you hit the ball."

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:53.380
"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.174
"Sometimes it rains."

01:40:56.592 --> 01:40:58.468
Think about that for a while.

01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:47.434
Oh, my.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.521
What happened?

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:35.398
I quit.

01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:40.529
Hit my dinger and I hung them up.

01:42:47.119 --> 01:42:49.079
I'm quitting too.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.331
I mean, boys, not baseball.

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:58.255
There might be an opening for a manager
in Visalia next spring.

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:05.387
Think I could make it
to the Show as a manager?

01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:09.432
You'd be great.

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:13.019
You'd be great.

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:19.109
I mean, because you understand
about nonlinear thinking.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:23.655
I mean, baseball seems like a linear game
with all those lines and box scores.

01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:26.283
But the fact is, it's a spacious
non-time kind of time to it.

01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:27.450
Annie.

01:43:28.578 --> 01:43:29.744
What?

01:43:30.329 --> 01:43:33.164
I got a lot of time to hear your theories.

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:36.459
And I wanna hear every damn one of them,

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:42.048
but now I'm tired and I don't want
to think about baseball.

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:44.426
And I don't wanna think
about quantum physics.

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:46.887
And I don't wanna think about nothing.

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:52.851
I just wanna be.

01:43:55.271 --> 01:43:57.188
I can do that, too.

01:43:59.609 --> 01:44:04.154
Walt Whitman once said,
"I see great things in baseball."

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:07.282
"It's our game. The American game."

01:44:07.325 --> 01:44:10.660
"It will repair our losses
and be a blessing to us."

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:12.829
You could look it up.

01:44:13.305 --> 01:44:19.637
