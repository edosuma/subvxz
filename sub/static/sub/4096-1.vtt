WEBVTT

01:33.460 --> 01:34.860
In the past 10 years,

01:34.862 --> 01:37.629
the pace of communication
and commerce

01:37.631 --> 01:39.531
accelerated astronomically,
didn't it?

01:41.334 --> 01:43.669
That lecture was interminable,
I need an espresso.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.206
<i> Duchess Carrie</i>
<i> likes espresso.</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:49.174
<i> Who's Duchess Carrie?</i>

01:49.176 --> 01:52.444
Duchess Carrie likes
certain things,
but not other things.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.580
<i> Can you figure out what</i>
<i> Duchess Carrie likes?</i>

01:56.483 --> 01:58.117
Caffeinated things?

01:58.119 --> 01:59.551
Caffeinated?

01:59.553 --> 02:00.752
- Tea?
<i>-  Nope.</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:06.792
With the Center's latest
technological innovation,

02:06.794 --> 02:10.329
we are working to empower
the average person
with a pragmatic response

02:10.331 --> 02:12.131
to today's unforgiving jun...

02:12.133 --> 02:12.798
Today's...

02:14.134 --> 02:15.400
Impenetrable job market.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.573
<i> Uh, does she eat?</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:24.710
<i> She eats croissants</i>
<i> and crabapples.</i>

02:26.813 --> 02:28.413
She likes things
that begin with "C"?

02:28.415 --> 02:29.748
No. She enjoys espresso.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.717
No collaborating.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.185
Croissants...

02:33.187 --> 02:34.486
She's French.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.522
You need to play
more games, Jules.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.557
Only one of you
can be the winner.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.192
If you cheat,
then nobody wins.

02:45.199 --> 02:48.600
- And as a result...
- Adenine...

02:48.602 --> 02:49.835
And due
to overpopulation...
<i> Cytosine.</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.470
Cytosine.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.671
- Today's job market...
<i>-  Guanine.</i>

02:52.673 --> 02:55.240
Guanine.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.476
There's no surprise that
anxiety and depression...
<i> Thiamine.</i>

02:57.478 --> 02:58.810
- ...have become the norm.
<i>-  Uracil.</i>

03:15.461 --> 03:17.829
<i> Duchess Carrie</i>
<i> likes looking at the moon.</i>

03:17.831 --> 03:19.798
Duchess Carrie loves
feeling cool.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.767
Moon, cool.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.968
Double letters...

03:22.970 --> 03:24.903
Duchess Carrie
likes double letters.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.338
Jules already got it.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.458
Not again.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.653
Where's your umbrella?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.520
<i> It's not raining.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:17.956
It is in Cherbourg.

04:17.958 --> 04:18.924
<i> Eternally?</i>

04:21.527 --> 04:25.397
<i> Dave, you're calling me.</i>

04:25.399 --> 04:28.033
Don't you think we should
give this a little more time?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.035
I need to talk to you
face to face.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.570
<i> I wasn't calling</i>
<i> about us.</i>

04:31.572 --> 04:33.038
Mom!

04:33.040 --> 04:33.872
<i> It's something much</i>
<i> more important.</i>

04:33.874 --> 04:35.641
End call.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.976
- Gwen?
<i>-  This conversation has ended.</i>

04:39.846 --> 04:40.979
That's your mother?

04:42.348 --> 04:43.682
Yup.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.817
She doesn't even look
like a mom.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.419
Holo me when
you hear from Arcadia?

04:47.421 --> 04:48.720
Tell her about
the Eastern Board luncheon.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.623
I'll make sure my mom
holds you a spot.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.013
I like it.
It's old looking.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.583
Who was that
with you guys?
Amanda Malthis.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.486
Oh, you decided
you like her?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.788
She has interesting moments.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.859
She wants me
to go with her to this
bonding camp for Eastern.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.616
So they're saying that
all this wacky hormonal stuff,

05:51.618 --> 05:54.619
that's coming from pressure
to be hyper productive.

05:54.621 --> 05:58.523
We have too many choices
and we're making the same ones
over and over again.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.125
And they're the wrong
choices actually.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.627
So it's like
natural deselection.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.364
Our DNA is opting out.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.968
Did you know that by the time
I'm 20, I may not have
any ova left?

06:11.604 --> 06:12.838
You know, for babies.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.043
You'd think awareness
would help things, but...

06:18.045 --> 06:19.444
Awareness influences things.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.746
It just takes time.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.680
How much time?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.057
Jules.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.129
Jules.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.832
I was going to tell you when
you were a little bit older.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.701
About the eggs.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.003
I can adopt from
other regions.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.005
There's always going
to be orphans who aren't
as lucky as us,

06:47.007 --> 06:48.140
who need families.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.810
Exactly.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.978
And I've always wanted
a big family.

07:08.828 --> 07:09.895
Oh, crud.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.097
What?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.565
It's an automated message
from Arcadia.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.734
Uh, I can't listen.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.543
<i> This is Melanie Matthews</i>
<i> from Arcadia Prep</i>
<i> Dean's Office.</i>

07:24.545 --> 07:26.845
<i> Although Jules' grades</i>
<i> were top-notch</i>

07:26.847 --> 07:29.648
<i> and her test scores</i>
<i> were excellent,</i>

07:29.650 --> 07:32.217
<i> there were a record number</i>
<i> of applications this year.</i>

07:32.219 --> 07:34.786
<i> And ultimately,</i>
<i> due to capacity issues,</i>

07:34.788 --> 07:36.688
<i> we could not make Jules</i>
<i> part of Arcadia Prep.</i>

07:40.159 --> 07:44.062
<i> And I see</i>
<i> the workers fill</i>
<i> those buildings.</i>

07:44.064 --> 07:47.632
<i> These guys are going</i>
<i> to get our economy</i>
<i> moving again</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:50.535
<i> with their innovation</i>
<i> and productivity.</i>

07:50.537 --> 07:52.003
<i> There is a bright</i>
<i> future ahead.</i>

07:53.774 --> 07:56.074
<i> Rebel group</i>
<i> Terra Mamoria</i>

07:56.076 --> 07:59.478
<i> is claiming responsibility</i>
<i> for two of the four nation's</i>
<i> explosions today.</i>

08:13.559 --> 08:14.826
That's a beautiful one.

08:40.753 --> 08:44.823
<i> Here at the Center for</i>
<i> Advanced Health and Living,</i>

08:44.825 --> 08:50.262
<i> our procedure provides</i>
<i> a solution for any long-term</i>
<i> health concerns.</i>

08:50.264 --> 08:54.766
<i> The experience is akin</i>
<i> to a seamless jump into</i>
<i> a disease-free body</i>

08:54.768 --> 08:56.868
<i> of your choosing.</i>

08:56.870 --> 08:59.538
<i> Through a lossless,</i>
<i> relatively painless process.</i>

09:01.908 --> 09:04.576
Would that this process
were more painless.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.211
Let's review Gwen's old test.

09:11.183 --> 09:14.152
It'll remind us of what
we're looking for.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.154
Do they know it could take
a year to find someone
as uniquely qualified?

09:17.924 --> 09:19.558
Gwen Koh's test, please.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.828
<i> Username, please.</i>

09:23.830 --> 09:26.831
Isa Cryer, damn it! We've been
here all afternoon.

09:26.833 --> 09:32.671
<i> In fact, the decisions</i>
<i> we make in life define us.</i>

09:32.673 --> 09:36.675
<i> So, shouldn't every woman</i>
<i> be defined by the totality</i>
<i> of her choices?</i>

09:36.677 --> 09:39.945
<i> Rather than her race,</i>
<i> height or health?</i>

09:39.947 --> 09:43.315
<i> These are things she often</i>
<i> cannot control.</i>

09:43.317 --> 09:46.851
<i> Here at the Center for</i>
<i> Advanced Health and Living,</i>

09:46.853 --> 09:52.090
<i> we are working to offer you</i>
<i> the safest alternatives</i>
<i> to invasive cosmetic surgery</i>

09:52.092 --> 09:55.160
<i> so you'll have every chance</i>
<i> to be the you</i>
<i> you were meant to be.</i>

10:09.709 --> 10:10.909
Thanks for taking
my call, Dave.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.212
I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.214
I know you're quite busy.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.682
<i> That's all right,</i>
<i> what's up?</i>

10:17.684 --> 10:20.018
I've been thinking about
my contract renewal.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.154
I've been working
below rate for a while.

10:23.156 --> 10:27.025
<i> Yes. You know, we've just</i>
<i> been talking about that.</i>

10:27.860 --> 10:30.662
You were?

10:30.664 --> 10:34.232
<i> Marketing just submitted</i>
<i> a report showing</i>
<i> pretty clearly that</i>

10:34.234 --> 10:38.770
<i> a younger demographic</i>
<i> would benefit from</i>
<i> awareness of our technology.</i>

10:38.772 --> 10:43.408
<i> and we simply can't</i>
<i> afford to alienate</i>
<i> any potential market.</i>

10:44.110 --> 10:46.344
Of course.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.948
<i> The board</i>
<i> just realized,</i>
<i> albeit on the late side,</i>

10:49.950 --> 10:55.220
<i> that we're obligated to</i>
<i> go a different direction</i>
<i> for the face of the Center.</i>

11:00.092 --> 11:02.961
Have... Have you already
found your younger candidate?

11:04.230 --> 11:07.065
<i> They've started to search.</i>

11:07.067 --> 11:09.267
<i> Isa Cryer is aggressively</i>
<i> reviewing candidates.</i>

11:10.336 --> 11:13.138
<i> Gwen, I did fight for you.</i>

11:13.140 --> 11:16.775
<i> There's no question that you</i>
<i> possess the highest level of</i>
<i> poise, talent and beauty.</i>

11:17.843 --> 11:18.743
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

11:23.215 --> 11:24.916
No. I'm sorry.

11:24.918 --> 11:25.984
I'm sorry.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.388
Jules didn't
get into Arcadia.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.727
And I don't know why.
She's brilliant.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.696
<i> Oh, you know, it's just</i>
<i> as likely you didn't know</i>
<i> the right people.</i>

11:39.331 --> 11:40.865
<i> Did she get in</i>
<i> anywhere else?</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:42.967
Eastern.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.069
<i> Oh, well, with Eastern</i>
<i> on her transcript,</i>
<i> she'll have options.</i>

11:44.071 --> 11:45.470
<i> My daughters went there.</i>

11:45.472 --> 11:48.473
I know, but tuition
has doubled since
your daughters.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.177
<i> Oh, okay.</i>

11:52.179 --> 11:54.112
<i> You're going to land</i>
<i> on your feet.</i>

11:54.114 --> 11:55.447
<i> You have to.</i>

12:31.784 --> 12:33.284
Upstairs woman
or downstairs woman?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.403
Both.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.522
Why aren't you
at school?

13:10.524 --> 13:12.490
Conservation day.
Are you going to Paris?

13:12.492 --> 13:15.527
Mmm-mmm. I have a short day
too, so I could meet
you after piano.

13:15.529 --> 13:16.528
Did you have your first
taste of the day?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.531
<i> Incoming call.</i>

13:19.533 --> 13:22.066
Hello, this is Gwen.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.135
<i> Hello, Gwen.</i>
<i> This is Drake with Dream No</i>
<i> More outplacement network.</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:25.403
Oh, hello, Drake.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.539
Uh, just one second,
please.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.874
<i> Sure.</i>
I have to go.
Are you set for today?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.476
Uh, what should we
tell Amanda's mom?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.444
About?
The Eastern luncheon.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.481
Tell her I'll be there.
Get more details.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.185
So I can go to Eastern?

13:40.187 --> 13:41.519
I got a call yesterday...
About the raise?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.090
Yes, about the raise.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.499
<i> Gwen, I called</i>
<i> to let you know,</i>
<i> that your information</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:56.534
<i> as of 3:30 a.m. this morning,</i>

13:56.536 --> 13:58.903
<i> is in our system and</i>
<i> you're good to go.</i>

13:58.905 --> 13:59.904
I'm actually
on my way in
to see you.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.941
<i> Why?</i>

14:02.943 --> 14:05.210
Well, don't you have
a speech to give me and
then we sit down together

14:05.212 --> 14:07.412
and focus on
the new days ahead?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.848
<i> Sounds good,</i>
<i> but you're already</i>
<i> a noted professional.</i>

14:09.850 --> 14:12.250
Thank you.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.618
<i> I'll be in touch the moment</i>
<i> we get a response.</i>

14:14.854 --> 14:15.920
Great.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.097
<i> There's one space you</i>
<i> could fill right away.</i>

14:26.099 --> 14:28.399
I'm sorry. Yes?

14:28.401 --> 14:31.502
<i> Your recent physical</i>
<i> pre-qualifies you to be</i>
<i> a paid egg donor.</i>

14:33.339 --> 14:36.040
An egg donor?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.376
<i> It could offset living costs</i>
<i> until we find you something</i>
<i> more permanent.</i>

14:40.312 --> 14:43.147
<i> Many women are not able</i>
<i> to have children anymore.</i>

14:43.149 --> 14:46.317
<i> And due to the great demand,</i>
<i> the donor age threshold</i>
<i> has risen.</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:53.491
<i> Miss Koh?</i>

14:53.493 --> 14:54.492
How long does
the process take?

14:55.461 --> 14:57.228
<i> Three months.</i>

14:57.230 --> 14:59.564
<i> You'll be paid</i>
<i> after the harvest.</i>

14:59.566 --> 15:03.334
That's not soon enough.
Can we just focus on the jobs
that I've outlined on my form?

15:03.336 --> 15:04.402
<i> Certainly.</i>

15:05.404 --> 15:06.337
Take what you can get.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.907
<i> Have a lovely day,</i>
<i> Miss Koh.</i>

15:17.383 --> 15:18.516
Are you okay?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.319
Are you?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.143
<i> Username, please.</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:20.578
Gwen Koh.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.046
<i> That entity does</i>
<i> not exist.</i>

16:22.048 --> 16:24.449
<i> Please try again.</i>
Gwen Koh.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.517
<i> That entity does not exist.</i>

16:26.519 --> 16:28.019
<i> Hello Gwen.</i>

16:28.021 --> 16:29.053
Evan, my ID's
not scanning.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.689
<i> What can I do for you?</i>

16:33.359 --> 16:34.659
Is Dave Fisher in?

16:35.527 --> 16:37.395
<i> He's offsite at the lab.</i>

16:37.397 --> 16:38.496
<i> Is that wardrobe?</i>

16:39.631 --> 16:40.698
Yes.

16:42.468 --> 16:43.735
<i> Please hold.</i>
Thank you.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.554
Closer.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.233
Closer.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.343
I found a solution
to our problem, Fisher.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.751
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit surprised.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.219
I've rarely seen you
over the years.

17:36.588 --> 17:37.755
The dungeon's
being renovated.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.227
Yours too?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.732
How's the job search?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.634
Well, there's been interest
in the past. So...

17:49.636 --> 17:51.069
I'm not worried.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.571
You've been pursued?

17:54.640 --> 17:55.673
By companies at our level?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.846
Well, I'm hardly surprised.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.148
People connect to you.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.250
The question that we have
to answer is in this current
job market,

18:06.252 --> 18:09.620
with shifting desirability
targets, can they get ahead
looking like you?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.757
And at your age?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.725
My position here wasn't only
about being a face.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.563
And the knowledge
I've acquired here,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.565
I can carry
into other positions.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.632
Teaching, for instance.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.767
You've taught before?

18:23.502 --> 18:24.635
In grad school.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.638
In grad school?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.507
Well, even in the real world,

18:29.509 --> 18:32.176
you won't make close to what
you were making here.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.178
The education profession has
gone pure tech.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.315
There is nothing in our
generation's skill pool
that can compete.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.819
Well, there must be something

18:41.821 --> 18:44.422
in a mere human existence
that has value.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.459
You and I, in our lifetimes,
will see progress

18:48.461 --> 18:51.796
1,000 times greater
than the previous century.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.297
But, because we're
mere humans,

18:53.299 --> 18:55.233
we won't be able
to comprehend it.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.568
Humans can only grasp
change at a rate they've
experienced it.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.406
<i> Which is why they</i>
<i> are being left behind.</i>

19:08.547 --> 19:09.714
How is your daughter?

19:12.451 --> 19:13.851
I understand she's quite
a talent.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.656
She keeps me alive.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.791
As do my girls.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.697
There is nothing fiercer
than a mother's love.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.909
Hello, Drake.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.277
<i> Hey, Claire.</i>

19:39.279 --> 19:41.879
Uh, no. This is Gwen Koh.

19:41.881 --> 19:42.947
<i> Hello, Gwen.</i>

19:42.949 --> 19:44.549
I see here
you just called me.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.818
Drake?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.520
<i> Yes, Gwen.</i>

19:49.522 --> 19:51.255
Have you heard something?
Do I have an interview?

19:53.225 --> 19:55.493
<i> There's been some activity</i>
<i> on your account.</i>

19:55.495 --> 19:57.428
<i> You've received</i>
<i> several inquiries.</i>

19:57.430 --> 20:00.431
<i> And one counter endorsement.</i>

20:00.433 --> 20:02.233
Counter endorsement?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.669
<i> A flag has been raised about</i>
<i> a detail on your resume.</i>

20:05.638 --> 20:10.575
<i> It is currently</i>
<i> under investigation.</i>

20:10.577 --> 20:12.843
It's a mistake.
I have verifications
for everything.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.419
Drake, can I ask who's filed
this counter endorsement?

20:21.421 --> 20:25.289
<i> Huh, would you like me to tell</i>
<i> you my astrological sign too?</i>

20:25.291 --> 20:26.524
I'm sorry?

20:27.826 --> 20:30.428
<i> Are you sorry?</i>

20:34.499 --> 20:37.301
Drake, are you
a human being?

20:37.303 --> 20:41.272
<i> That's a funny question.</i>
<i> How do you define</i>
<i> a human being?</i>

20:41.274 --> 20:43.007
Do you have blood running
through your veins?

20:46.578 --> 20:48.813
<i> That is a definition</i>
<i> of a human being?</i>

20:56.555 --> 20:58.022
I didn't know.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.857
<i> That sounds more like</i>
<i> a human being.</i>

20:59.859 --> 21:01.425
<i> Not to know.</i>

21:08.467 --> 21:09.700
Account information.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.702
<i> Gwen Koh.</i>
Balance, please.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.770
<i> Checking or saving...</i>
Combined.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.641
<i> 743 units.</i>

21:16.643 --> 21:19.977
<i> Automatic payment</i>
<i> will be made after...</i>
Cancel automatic payment.

21:19.979 --> 21:20.911
<i> Canceled.</i>

21:34.793 --> 21:36.027
How long will you
be staying today?

21:36.029 --> 21:36.894
How much is it again?

21:38.797 --> 21:39.864
Alone?

21:41.900 --> 21:42.967
Did you need company?

21:44.503 --> 21:45.569
No.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.953
Did you hear me?
I was terrible.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.020
No, you weren't,
where's Ginger?

23:10.022 --> 23:12.423
I told her
not to come over.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.126
Holoprof was trying to finish
the 20th and 21st centuries
in one class period.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.428
All I remember is
the 2033 bubble

23:17.430 --> 23:20.498
and the New York
traditionalist movement, which
he said is taking over now.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.966
Which I challenged.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.535
Are women really going
backwards going forward?

23:24.537 --> 23:25.403
You're not.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.039
Let's get you
something to eat.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.618
Uh, she's not open.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.067
I don't know why I'm alive.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.808
That's a bit extreme.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.942
What happened with Ginger?

24:04.944 --> 24:05.810
There's so much to do.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.114
I need to exercise more,
study more,

24:10.116 --> 24:12.750
I need to do more
volunteer work
in art.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.920
I need to be smarter, nicer,
prettier and classier.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.089
But what's the point?

24:20.725 --> 24:21.992
Many reasons.
Like?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.095
Music.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.169
Being loved by your
amazing mother.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.071
None of you know
what you're doing.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.507
You all pretend
to have a plan for us,

24:36.509 --> 24:40.010
but everyone's just
either greedy or desperate.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.149
Why did you have me?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.585
When you knew the world was
so bad and you had
to struggle so much.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.022
You're all alone
with no one to help you.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.894
There was a time when
I was also confused
why I was alive.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.932
And I guess something
in me thought that...

25:07.105 --> 25:08.172
I mean,
I thought having you

25:09.941 --> 25:11.809
might make my life more...

25:13.879 --> 25:14.979
Worthwhile?

25:19.117 --> 25:20.918
You make me very happy.

25:49.314 --> 25:50.915
<i> Archived message.</i>

25:50.917 --> 25:54.251
<i> Hi, this is Lily.</i>

25:54.253 --> 25:56.020
<i> Your one and only cousin?</i>

25:58.890 --> 26:00.090
<i> Happy birthday.</i>

26:03.628 --> 26:04.828
<i> I'm at the restaurant.</i>

26:08.266 --> 26:09.867
<i> I still worry about you.</i>

26:13.905 --> 26:16.607
<i> It must be really hard to be</i>
<i> on your own these days.</i>

26:20.313 --> 26:22.646
<i> Tomorrow's events.</i>

26:22.648 --> 26:25.015
<i> Eastern Board luncheon.</i>

26:25.017 --> 26:26.150
<i> I hope you</i>
<i> have somebody.</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:29.119
<i> Would you like</i>
<i> to send a response?</i>

26:32.691 --> 26:34.992
<i> For our next hour,</i>

26:34.994 --> 26:39.129
<i> we'll be discussing the recent</i>
<i> rise in child prostitution</i>
<i> in our country.</i>

26:39.131 --> 26:41.031
<i> Its causes, symptoms and...</i>

26:41.033 --> 26:43.233
One week of water left.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.735
<i> A report</i>
<i> last week from</i>
<i> the Department of...</i>

26:44.737 --> 26:47.137
I should get paid tomorrow.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.773
<i> ...found that 4% of girls</i>
<i> and boys between the ages</i>
<i> of 12 and 18,</i>

26:49.775 --> 26:51.875
<i> will have taken part</i>
<i> in a sex work activity...</i>

27:11.329 --> 27:12.396
Where did you
get this recipe?

27:16.334 --> 27:17.668
My cousin Lily.

27:19.671 --> 27:20.804
Lily from the picture?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.276
Yup. She taught me
when I had to work
at her restaurant.

27:52.704 --> 27:53.804
Gwen Koh.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.112
How wonderful you
could join us.

28:03.815 --> 28:04.848
Oh!

28:06.818 --> 28:10.187
My Amanda has told me so
much about you and Jules.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.025
Gwen is the head of the
Center for Advanced Health
and Living.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.729
One of the most forward
thinking companies
in our midst.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.198
About to reveal the biotech
bubble of the moment.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.067
You're a scientist?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.736
Oh, not exactly.

28:25.738 --> 28:29.273
Olivia's intrigued by any
woman making her way through
the job climate today.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.108
Especially with the backlash
we're experiencing.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.047
I'm sorry.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.259
We would have moved forward
a while ago,

28:49.261 --> 28:51.261
but her father has clout.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.966
We do what is best for
our children.

28:57.368 --> 28:58.435
We do.

28:59.938 --> 29:02.306
We studied Jules' CV,

29:02.308 --> 29:05.409
it's clear your agenda for
your daughter is
as your career, unstoppable.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.513
Gwen, the mission of our
bonding camp is hundreds
of years old

29:09.515 --> 29:12.249
and 100 years
into the future.

29:12.251 --> 29:17.054
We comingle the finest boys
and girls, in advance of their
prep school experience.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.357
Have them introduce their
innate talents and dreams
to one another.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.927
To create a culture that will
cohesify them through their
years together in school.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.163
In our world's history,
even when resources
were limited,

29:26.165 --> 29:28.432
there's always been room
for an elite.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.300
As there's less room now,

29:30.302 --> 29:33.837
we're putting our brains
and our pocketbooks
where it counts.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.942
This all sounds good.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.879
Good?

29:41.881 --> 29:42.980
Ideal.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.849
I'm just wondering...

29:45.851 --> 29:48.552
We've put in 30K each,
we would ask you for 10,

29:48.554 --> 29:50.154
to hold the waitlist spot
for Jules.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.991
I might need
a day or two.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.959
Loosen up
Jules' father.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.263
He's not a part
of our lives.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.334
And isn't going to be?

30:07.238 --> 30:08.939
Not even Jules' life?

30:18.249 --> 30:19.116
That is a wild card.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.457
Hello, dear.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.535
This is the only time
in your daughter's life

30:38.537 --> 30:40.470
when her choices
will make a difference.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.509
Take the help you can get.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.268
<i> Gwen, look at us.</i>

31:11.270 --> 31:13.503
<i> We're talking again</i>
<i> after all these years.</i>

31:13.505 --> 31:16.240
<i> What a blessing.</i>

31:16.242 --> 31:19.543
<i> So let's do this right, okay,</i>
<i> and learn from our mistakes?</i>

31:19.545 --> 31:21.979
<i> I'm truly sorry</i>
<i> for leaving you alone</i>
<i> with Jules</i>

31:21.981 --> 31:23.146
<i> and turning my back on you.</i>

31:25.950 --> 31:27.451
Mom, thank you
for saying that, but...

31:29.153 --> 31:31.955
I have to get something
together, now. Or else...

31:31.957 --> 31:34.124
<i> Or else you'll continue</i>
<i> to suffer, I know.</i>

31:34.126 --> 31:34.992
<i> And so will Jules.</i>

31:37.962 --> 31:38.896
<i> So, how much money</i>
<i> do you need?</i>

31:41.533 --> 31:43.500
$40,000 would get us
through the next month.

31:46.371 --> 31:48.205
<i> $40,000?</i>

31:48.207 --> 31:49.940
Access costs money, Mom.
You know that.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.944
<i> So, who does she</i>
<i> look like now?</i>

31:55.446 --> 31:56.313
She looks like herself.

31:58.616 --> 32:01.184
<i> Well, send me</i>
<i> some pictures, okay?</i>

32:01.186 --> 32:02.486
<i> You know, it doesn't matter</i>
<i> who she looks like.</i>

32:10.061 --> 32:13.697
<i> Your father thinks</i>
<i> about you, you know?</i>

32:13.699 --> 32:15.265
<i> He talked about you</i>
<i> in his sermon today.</i>

32:15.267 --> 32:16.333
Mom, don't.

32:27.078 --> 32:29.179
<i> Okay, uh,</i>
<i> let me call Dad.</i>

32:29.181 --> 32:30.347
No!

32:33.251 --> 32:34.584
<i> If I don't ask your father...</i>

32:34.586 --> 32:35.652
He's not ever going to meet
my daughter, Mom.

32:37.322 --> 32:38.555
I will die
before that happens.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.391
<i> Gwen.</i>

32:46.331 --> 32:47.464
<i> He's changed.</i>

32:48.700 --> 32:49.566
<i> God has forgiven him.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:54.471
<i> Your father says</i>
<i> I can't help you.</i>

32:54.473 --> 32:56.440
Aren't you still working?

32:56.442 --> 32:58.608
<i> Let's pray</i>
<i> for your forgiveness.</i>

32:58.610 --> 33:00.510
<i> Remember,</i>
<i> you used to love to pray?</i>

33:00.512 --> 33:01.378
I...
<i> Dear Lord,</i>

33:02.513 --> 33:05.482
<i> please listen to us.</i>

33:05.484 --> 33:08.185
<i> At this time, we're ready for</i>
<i> you to take away...</i>
I'm hanging up now.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.187
<i> ...this sin that</i>
<i> Gwen has committed.</i>

33:10.189 --> 33:12.055
Goodbye.
<i> Thank you for your infinite</i>
<i> patience, dear Lord.</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:14.324
I love you, Mama.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.292
<i> And your infinite mercy</i>
<i> that you have shown Gwen.</i>
Goodbye. End call.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.764
<i> Please look down</i>
<i> on her now with love</i>

33:20.766 --> 33:22.165
<i> and heal her of this sin.</i>

33:25.303 --> 33:27.637
<i> Help her to start</i>
<i> a brand new life.</i>

33:27.639 --> 33:29.539
<i> A brand new life with you</i>
<i> at the center of her heart.</i>

33:31.676 --> 33:33.610
<i> And please...</i>

33:33.612 --> 33:36.046
<i> Please watch out for Jules</i>

33:36.048 --> 33:37.647
<i> and wrap her</i>
<i> in your loving care,</i>
<i> dear Lord.</i>

33:56.100 --> 33:57.501
<i> Sorry, how've you been?</i>

34:00.438 --> 34:01.505
Am I too old?

34:02.373 --> 34:03.440
To be of use?

34:06.644 --> 34:07.511
<i> What're you talking about,</i>
<i> Gwen?</i>

34:09.714 --> 34:10.747
<i> So many women</i>
<i> are out of work.</i>

34:12.583 --> 34:14.818
<i> Some are in real trouble.</i>

34:14.820 --> 34:17.421
<i> To be frank, there is talk</i>
<i> among recruiters about</i>

34:18.790 --> 34:20.323
<i> letting women</i>
<i> stay unemployed and,</i>

34:21.559 --> 34:24.628
<i> well, return to the home.</i>

34:24.630 --> 34:27.697
<i> The perception is it's safer</i>
<i> than putting millions of</i>
<i> desperate men on the street.</i>

34:29.734 --> 34:31.735
Safer? For whom?

34:33.204 --> 34:34.071
<i> Everyone.</i>

34:37.141 --> 34:38.141
Make me
the younger candidate.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.344
<i> I'm sorry?</i>

34:41.346 --> 34:42.212
The procedure
you're launching...

34:43.381 --> 34:45.449
Use it on me.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.316
Put me into
a younger body.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.521
<i> We haven't had any civilian</i>
<i> test subjects yet.</i>

34:51.523 --> 34:53.557
I want to be the face
of the Center again.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.658
I've done all
the prep work already.

34:56.194 --> 34:57.761
I'd be both
an expert and a user.

34:58.596 --> 34:59.729
Your ideal spokesperson.

35:03.401 --> 35:04.668
I'm the best there is
at this job.

35:10.708 --> 35:11.775
Can I talk
about this later?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.310
I really need
to do this later.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.778
I can't get an interview,
Dave, not one.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.645
<i> I really have to go.</i>

35:17.515 --> 35:20.684
I have to
position Jules now.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.420
<i> If I can get her</i>
<i> into a good school,</i>
<i> she'll have a chance.</i>

35:23.422 --> 35:24.855
I can't let her become
one of these women,

35:24.857 --> 35:26.356
so desperate
that they would do anything.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.194
Dave,

35:31.196 --> 35:32.829
you would do the same
for your own girls,

35:34.265 --> 35:35.332
if you were in my place.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.244
<i> Marketing has a specific</i>
<i> physical type in mind.</i>

35:47.246 --> 35:49.846
<i> They're looking at candidates</i>
<i> that come off</i>
<i> as a touch more universal.</i>

35:51.682 --> 35:54.718
<i> So if I could tell them</i>
<i> that you'd be willing to</i>

35:54.720 --> 35:57.621
<i> give them full control</i>
<i> over the creation</i>
<i> of your host body,</i>

35:57.623 --> 35:58.822
that might show them
how much you care about

36:00.625 --> 36:01.691
the product's success.

36:11.802 --> 36:12.869
<i> Okay.</i>

36:15.406 --> 36:16.373
You'd be willing
to do that?

36:20.845 --> 36:21.778
The point is to push
the product, right?

36:23.648 --> 36:24.681
<i> When isn't it?</i>

36:27.251 --> 36:27.918
I'll talk to them.

36:29.420 --> 36:30.487
<i> Thank you.</i>

36:34.392 --> 36:35.625
Evan?

36:35.627 --> 36:36.960
<i> Yes, Miss Cryer.</i>

36:36.962 --> 36:39.196
Make replications
of Fisher's last call.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.664
CC the Board.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.531
<i> Working on it.</i>

36:51.409 --> 36:52.976
Couldn't say this
on the record,

36:52.978 --> 36:55.512
but most of our test subjects
develop breathing issues.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.749
They have to get a shot
every two hours for a year.

37:01.686 --> 37:02.719
There's recurring pain.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.223
I'll deal with it.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.995
Evan, what's wrong
with our filters?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.863
I can barely
understand them.

37:13.865 --> 37:14.764
<i> There's an error.</i>

37:15.700 --> 37:16.566
<i> Working on it.</i>

37:21.439 --> 37:23.273
The board was expecting
you'd offer yourself up.

37:25.910 --> 37:26.743
You're the
logical next step.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.715
After this, the board'll wanna
protect their show piece,

37:35.286 --> 37:35.952
Jules'll get what she needs.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.258
Are you ready to
explain all this to her?

37:41.260 --> 37:42.759
I've been trying
not to think about it.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.827
Well, think about it.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.406
This might be
a bigger sacrifice
than you imagine.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.310
Gwen, it's not like
you're a consciousness
in a jar

38:00.312 --> 38:02.746
that we're dumping
into another jar.

38:02.748 --> 38:03.813
The technology
is not there yet.

38:05.816 --> 38:06.683
What's the reality then?

38:14.925 --> 38:16.626
<i> It's the location.</i>
<i> I don't think there is a fix.</i>

38:18.529 --> 38:20.764
What're you trying
to hide from me, Fisher?

38:25.803 --> 38:26.870
Please don't do this.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.644
But this is still Jules'
only chance though, isn't it?

38:40.751 --> 38:42.052
You know it is.
You just won't say it.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.023
I'm not going to get
another job.

38:48.726 --> 38:49.959
They'll make sure of it.

38:55.733 --> 38:56.800
I want

39:00.338 --> 39:01.371
Christmas with her first.

40:35.533 --> 40:36.199
What's wrong?

40:38.669 --> 40:40.003
Nothing.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.671
I was thinking about dinner.

42:31.315 --> 42:33.783
If I had to go away,

42:33.785 --> 42:36.219
you'd be able to take care
of things here, right?

42:36.221 --> 42:37.086
You'd do okay without me.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.658
I guess so.
How long?

42:44.028 --> 42:46.729
I don't know.
A while.

42:46.731 --> 42:47.931
A while sounds too long.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.149
I hope you think
you're pretty.

43:09.119 --> 43:11.788
Sometimes.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.057
If someone asked you
to change something
about the way you look,

43:15.292 --> 43:16.159
what would it be?

43:20.698 --> 43:23.333
My nose skinnier,
my shins longer,
my jumps higher.

43:23.335 --> 43:24.200
We did this in class.

43:28.706 --> 43:31.040
And what would you change
about me?

43:32.610 --> 43:33.276
Nothing.

43:37.081 --> 43:40.650
We're going through
a shift at work.

43:40.652 --> 43:41.317
It comes along
with my raise.

43:43.754 --> 43:44.621
What kind of shift?

43:46.023 --> 43:47.757
In my appearance.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.292
They want to appeal
to younger audiences.

43:53.897 --> 43:54.831
I guess that makes sense.

43:56.166 --> 43:57.166
It's good that
they'll pay for it.

44:15.753 --> 44:16.419
They're here.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.746
Goodbye, Miss Koh.

44:57.294 --> 45:00.129
<i> Hi, Mom.</i>

45:00.131 --> 45:04.167
<i> Everyone's calling</i>
<i> their families before</i>
<i> we go tech-free.</i>

45:04.169 --> 45:06.469
<i> But you can still reach me</i>
<i> through the camp office</i>
<i> if you need me.</i>

45:09.373 --> 45:10.473
<i> It's super beautiful out here.</i>

45:11.475 --> 45:12.341
<i> Really quiet.</i>

45:14.011 --> 45:15.278
<i> I think I just heard</i>
<i> myself blink.</i>

45:17.114 --> 45:17.947
<i> I love you.</i>

45:20.884 --> 45:22.051
<i> I hope you're not</i>
<i> working too hard.</i>

45:23.854 --> 45:26.055
<i> You should go out</i>
<i> and celebrate your big raise.</i>

45:32.963 --> 45:33.830
<i> New message.</i>

45:35.399 --> 45:37.066
<i> Hi.</i>

45:37.068 --> 45:38.101
<i> It's Lily, again.</i>

45:41.839 --> 45:44.807
<i> I hope you got</i>
<i> my last message.</i>

45:44.809 --> 45:46.008
<i> I wanted to wish you</i>
<i> a happy birthday.</i>

45:49.246 --> 45:50.313
<i> You know where to find us.</i>

47:26.977 --> 47:28.311
I remembered the code.

47:29.246 --> 47:30.112
All three of our birthdays.

47:34.618 --> 47:35.484
We never changed it.

47:41.091 --> 47:41.958
Just one minute.

47:52.970 --> 47:55.037
Is Lily out there?

47:55.039 --> 47:57.273
You need to call us
first and say exactly
why you wanna see us.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.143
Han!

48:01.145 --> 48:02.578
Okay, we're not putting her
through this. Please.

48:04.882 --> 48:05.548
Hey.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.417
I'm sorry, okay?

48:08.419 --> 48:09.418
I didn't know that.
Okay, I'm coming.

48:13.523 --> 48:15.191
Okay, she's had a long day.

48:15.193 --> 48:16.058
It's not
a good time for this.

48:17.127 --> 48:18.895
I need to...
Please.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.463
Go. Please don't do this.

48:23.667 --> 48:24.533
I am begging you.

48:49.626 --> 48:51.260
You need to stop watching
those crime shows.

48:53.196 --> 48:55.031
What's the matter?
Nothing.

48:55.033 --> 48:57.333
Where are the boys?
They're waiting for you
in the car.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.702
You're taking them
to practice, right?
Yeah.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.504
Thank you, honey.

49:01.506 --> 49:02.638
I'll go pick up menus
for dinner.

49:09.212 --> 49:10.546
I have to see her now.

49:10.548 --> 49:12.581
Lily! Lily!

49:19.589 --> 49:21.524
Well, this is
a nice surprise.

49:21.526 --> 49:22.692
But we're about
to open for dinner.

49:24.394 --> 49:25.461
No.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.663
We have time.

49:28.732 --> 49:29.565
It's fine.

49:31.735 --> 49:32.601
Go get the boys.

49:33.603 --> 49:34.670
You should meet.

49:37.074 --> 49:38.207
Lily, do you remember...

49:38.209 --> 49:39.108
Gwen, we're
really busy today.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.247
You know, don't you?

49:50.120 --> 49:50.987
Yes.

49:52.356 --> 49:53.222
Han told me.

49:56.693 --> 49:57.560
It was a long time ago.

50:00.263 --> 50:01.297
I had a child.

50:04.167 --> 50:05.034
When?

50:08.472 --> 50:09.572
We...

50:11.308 --> 50:12.375
Had a child.

50:15.045 --> 50:16.178
That's not possible.

50:17.381 --> 50:18.614
She was seeing other guys.

50:18.616 --> 50:19.682
I lied about that.

50:26.590 --> 50:27.456
Well, then you're lying
about this.

50:28.759 --> 50:30.493
- No. Her name is Jules.
- No.

50:30.495 --> 50:31.360
- She just turned 13.
- No. No.

50:34.564 --> 50:35.731
You can't do it this way.

50:39.803 --> 50:41.270
And so I stayed away
as long as I could,

50:41.272 --> 50:42.805
because I didn't want to do
any more damage.

50:45.175 --> 50:47.576
The only reason I'm here
is to ask that you consider
helping me,

50:47.578 --> 50:49.612
helping your daughter,
and then we'll be gone.

50:54.051 --> 50:54.717
The boys are
still in the car.

50:56.119 --> 50:57.453
Han!
Am I taking them or not?

51:11.234 --> 51:13.102
You know, you never believed
I was there for you.

51:14.204 --> 51:15.071
Even when we were little.

51:16.473 --> 51:17.573
Why would you
be there for me?

51:18.675 --> 51:20.176
I slept with your husband.

51:20.178 --> 51:21.210
And he slept with you.

51:27.150 --> 51:28.350
You must feel so lonely.

51:36.626 --> 51:38.527
I just need help for a year

51:38.529 --> 51:40.463
or six months,
and I can even
pay you interest.

51:44.768 --> 51:45.701
You won't even
have to see us.

51:47.737 --> 51:50.739
You can move on
and be the same
as you were before.

51:56.346 --> 51:57.213
Why do you do this?

52:00.817 --> 52:03.719
Why do you continually
go into things
that will be a disaster?

52:07.724 --> 52:11.160
I've been trying to get you
to help me heal this family.

52:11.162 --> 52:14.230
And when you finally
show up, you just bring
more pain.

52:19.603 --> 52:20.836
That's what I do.

52:25.543 --> 52:27.710
The parking lot's filling up.
We need to open now.
Okay.

52:28.411 --> 52:29.478
Hey, you.

52:34.918 --> 52:36.218
I can't talk about this
anymore right now.

52:41.391 --> 52:44.426
I wish I had time.
But I don't.

52:44.428 --> 52:45.494
We need time.

52:46.329 --> 52:47.630
This is a lot.

52:47.632 --> 52:48.697
Shh, it's okay.

52:51.535 --> 52:53.169
Aren't we going to practice?

52:53.171 --> 52:54.170
As soon as we open
the restaurant, sweetie.

53:00.210 --> 53:00.876
Please.

53:02.646 --> 53:03.712
We have kids too.

53:15.525 --> 53:16.892
I know you've always
been there for me.

53:19.396 --> 53:20.262
I know.

54:46.850 --> 54:48.317
<i> We did sitting</i>
<i> meditation too.</i>

54:49.719 --> 54:50.786
<i> But it wasn't as fun.</i>

54:53.323 --> 54:56.992
<i> Sometimes</i>
<i> if things got loud or...</i>

54:56.994 --> 54:58.894
<i> I couldn't go to my room</i>
<i> I would do the spinning.</i>

55:01.464 --> 55:02.898
<i> I felt energetic afterwards.</i>

55:04.534 --> 55:05.401
<i> Like I could do anything.</i>

55:10.006 --> 55:11.573
<i> I met a ton</i>
<i> of fun people.</i>

55:12.742 --> 55:13.809
People.

55:15.812 --> 55:16.879
A boy?

55:19.449 --> 55:20.316
Both.

55:22.852 --> 55:23.919
But I miss Ginger.

55:26.589 --> 55:27.656
Jules?

55:29.025 --> 55:30.059
Do you remember
what I said about

55:31.494 --> 55:32.695
having to make a change
at work?

55:48.611 --> 55:50.012
It'll be hard for me
to take in oxygen at first,

55:52.449 --> 55:54.049
which will affect
the blood flow to my brain.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.721
You may have to
remind me of things.

56:00.757 --> 56:02.391
Especially
what's important to you.

56:06.563 --> 56:07.429
This is a big change.

56:10.433 --> 56:11.533
No one will recognize you.

56:13.136 --> 56:14.470
I'll have a special ID.

56:15.839 --> 56:17.539
And as more people
get the procedure done,

56:20.043 --> 56:21.844
it'll feel easier
to explain.

56:25.682 --> 56:26.548
She's pretty.

56:31.554 --> 56:32.421
Don't you think so?

56:40.663 --> 56:42.131
Would you feel okay
around her

56:43.099 --> 56:43.966
first thing
in the morning?

56:46.503 --> 56:47.169
If you were sick?

56:48.838 --> 56:50.606
Imagine if she
got frustrated

56:50.608 --> 56:51.673
or even mad.

56:52.776 --> 56:53.842
You keep saying "she."

56:55.845 --> 56:56.912
It's still you, right?

57:00.683 --> 57:02.551
I'm sorry.
This whole thing is
kind of weird for me too.

57:54.471 --> 57:55.137
What is this?

58:05.014 --> 58:06.081
This is me?

58:16.693 --> 58:17.759
You're amazing.

58:20.063 --> 58:22.164
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

58:29.038 --> 58:30.105
Listen to me.

58:32.041 --> 58:34.042
It's good to be humble,

58:34.044 --> 58:35.077
but you need
to know your value.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.781
The ideas, the wisdom,

58:41.184 --> 58:42.851
and the kindness
in you.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.987
That's the secret
beauty everyone wants.

58:52.929 --> 58:53.996
Are you okay?

1:00:59.656 --> 1:01:01.323
...live emotionally.

1:02:13.096 --> 1:02:15.163
The Center's procedure

1:02:16.866 --> 1:02:19.034
provides a
painless alternative

1:02:20.269 --> 1:02:23.071
to invasive cosmetic surgery.

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:27.442
We move you
into another body
and the lossless...

1:02:36.452 --> 1:02:38.353
The Center's procedure

1:02:38.355 --> 1:02:43.358
provides a
painless alternative to
invasive cosmetic surgery.

1:02:53.870 --> 1:02:59.074
<i> The experience is</i>
<i> akin to a seamless jump into</i>
<i> a brand new body,</i>

1:02:59.076 --> 1:03:04.146
circumventing the extensive
recovery period of invasive
cosmetic surgery.

1:03:04.148 --> 1:03:07.883
I can attest to
the seamlessness
of this experience,

1:03:07.885 --> 1:03:11.086
not only as the head
of the Center for
Advanced Health and Living,

1:03:11.088 --> 1:03:14.156
but also a very
satisfied test subject.

1:03:26.536 --> 1:03:29.471
Okay. So who
out there thinks
they have an imagination?

1:03:33.042 --> 1:03:34.276
Everyone?

1:03:37.180 --> 1:03:41.082
<i> Okay, everyone.</i>
<i> Close your eyes.</i>

1:03:41.084 --> 1:03:44.386
<i> Imagine a world where you</i>
<i> were diagnosed with</i>
<i> a terminal illness,</i>

1:03:44.388 --> 1:03:47.389
<i> but you live to see your</i>
<i> great-grandkids go to college.</i>

1:03:50.293 --> 1:03:54.162
<i> Now let's imagine</i>
<i> living 48 years</i>
<i> with a clubfoot.</i>

1:03:55.398 --> 1:03:58.366
<i> But on your 50th birthday,</i>

1:03:58.368 --> 1:04:00.001
<i> you're a professional</i>
<i> ballet dancer.</i>

1:04:04.207 --> 1:04:05.207
Now open your eyes.

1:04:10.213 --> 1:04:12.514
<i> You don't have to dream</i>
<i> up that world anymore.</i>

1:04:19.155 --> 1:04:20.388
That world is here,

1:04:21.224 --> 1:04:22.591
and it's yours.

1:04:27.330 --> 1:04:29.397
<i> New recorded</i>
<i> hologram message.</i>

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:33.935
<i> I was in shock.</i>

1:04:36.005 --> 1:04:37.405
<i> I hope you understand.</i>

1:04:37.407 --> 1:04:39.975
<i> The day you visited us</i>

1:04:39.977 --> 1:04:42.310
<i> reminded me how much</i>
<i> I hated who I used to be.</i>

1:04:45.214 --> 1:04:46.314
<i> We wanna help.</i>

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:00.929
<i> I miss you.</i>

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:40.135
Did you forget your shot?

1:05:43.139 --> 1:05:44.005
Yeah.

1:05:45.374 --> 1:05:46.308
I forgot my shot.

1:05:48.411 --> 1:05:49.477
Sorry.

1:06:42.365 --> 1:06:43.698
Don't come
to meet me anymore.

1:06:45.267 --> 1:06:46.267
Not until you feel better.

1:06:48.204 --> 1:06:49.037
You think I'm an idiot.

1:06:51.574 --> 1:06:52.640
It doesn't matter
what I think of you.

1:07:39.688 --> 1:07:40.755
Did the operation
make you weird?

1:07:44.393 --> 1:07:47.195
You seem weird.

1:07:47.197 --> 1:07:49.397
<i> The majority of</i>
<i> people who are down</i>
<i> on their luck</i>

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:52.434
<i> are peaceful,</i>
<i> law-abiding citizens.</i>

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:54.803
<i> But you know, there are</i>
<i> these people out there,</i>

1:07:54.805 --> 1:07:58.807
<i> that think the way</i>
<i> to solve it is</i>
<i> violence and destruction,</i>

1:07:58.809 --> 1:08:00.108
<i> bombing and terror.</i>

1:08:01.444 --> 1:08:03.711
<i> Look at the success</i>
<i> of our city.</i>

1:08:07.517 --> 1:08:09.184
<i> New skyscrapers going up</i>
<i> all the time,</i>
<i> bigger and better.</i>

1:08:09.186 --> 1:08:11.186
<i> These are</i>

1:08:11.188 --> 1:08:13.655
<i> majestic, gorgeous</i>
<i> works of art</i>

1:08:13.657 --> 1:08:18.193
<i> designed by some</i>
<i> of the top internationally</i>
<i> renowned architects.</i>

1:08:18.195 --> 1:08:22.630
<i> We live in a great, great</i>
<i> city and we are fortunate</i>
<i> to be alive in these times.</i>

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:41.716
<i> Don't get distracted.</i>

1:09:07.510 --> 1:09:08.376
Can you turn that off?

1:09:10.579 --> 1:09:11.646
I thought you liked it.

1:09:12.581 --> 1:09:13.648
Not right now.

1:09:28.531 --> 1:09:29.797
Can you cheer up?

1:09:29.799 --> 1:09:32.500
What for?
How about for your mother?

1:09:32.502 --> 1:09:35.436
Because of me, you might
actually get somewhere instead
of dreaming your life away.

1:09:35.438 --> 1:09:36.304
I'm not dreaming.

1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:39.207
I'm thinking.

1:09:47.449 --> 1:09:48.516
Where's my mother?

1:09:51.820 --> 1:09:52.954
Get back to work.
You're not her.

1:09:59.595 --> 1:10:00.795
Where is she?

1:10:03.199 --> 1:10:05.266
What happened?

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:15.510
Get away.

1:10:38.467 --> 1:10:39.334
Well, you were right.

1:10:40.302 --> 1:10:41.502
About the pain not going away.

1:10:46.875 --> 1:10:47.909
I feel this anger...

1:10:51.847 --> 1:10:52.914
Like

1:10:56.619 --> 1:10:58.620
something is sitting next to
me screaming all the time.

1:11:03.792 --> 1:11:05.960
<i> It's what we're calling</i>
<i> mnemonic dissonance.</i>

1:11:05.962 --> 1:11:08.963
<i> It's your new body's</i>
<i> instincts clashing</i>
<i> with your old memories.</i>

1:11:08.965 --> 1:11:10.398
<i> It might help you to</i>
<i> concentrate your thoughts</i>

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:12.367
<i> on what's good</i>
<i> for your daughter.</i>

1:11:12.369 --> 1:11:13.568
For some reason I don't
want to focus on her.

1:11:15.771 --> 1:11:18.039
<i> Your animal connection</i>
<i> with her may not feel</i>
<i> like it's there,</i>

1:11:18.041 --> 1:11:19.307
<i> but it will come back.</i>

1:11:20.843 --> 1:11:21.909
I think

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:29.584
she and I need a break
from each other.

1:11:29.586 --> 1:11:31.586
<i> Jules needs your help</i>
<i> with her transition</i>
<i> into prep school.</i>

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:32.420
She hates me.

1:11:39.695 --> 1:11:41.896
She'll probably be relieved
to get away from me.

1:11:46.001 --> 1:11:46.868
But I don't mind.

1:11:51.674 --> 1:11:53.074
<i> Then what was the point</i>
<i> of any of this?</i>

1:11:55.511 --> 1:11:56.377
Do you
remember this place?

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:59.414
Yeah. We met here
before Christmas.

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:00.081
Well, we didn't.

1:12:07.423 --> 1:12:08.756
Someone's got to straighten
out your priorities

1:12:08.758 --> 1:12:10.425
before you squander
everything for Jules.

1:12:20.035 --> 1:12:21.903
This might be a bigger
sacrifice than you imagine.

1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:26.374
Gwen, it's not like you're a
consciousness in a jar

1:12:26.376 --> 1:12:27.108
that we're dumping
into another jar.

1:12:28.610 --> 1:12:30.645
The technology is
not there yet.

1:12:30.647 --> 1:12:33.414
What do you mean? My marketing
characterizes the procedure.

1:12:33.416 --> 1:12:35.616
It's just that,
a consciousness transplant.

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:36.751
That's marketing.

1:12:38.053 --> 1:12:39.821
What's the reality then?

1:12:39.823 --> 1:12:41.422
In order to reproduce
your memories,

1:12:41.424 --> 1:12:44.125
we have to plant
electrodes in your brain.

1:12:44.127 --> 1:12:46.961
And in the brain
of the new host.

1:12:46.963 --> 1:12:49.464
We use a semi-separable
feedback loop between
the two of you,

1:12:49.466 --> 1:12:51.933
to generate a
psycho-physiological twin.

1:12:51.935 --> 1:12:53.735
New neurons, cloned matter.

1:12:54.436 --> 1:12:55.503
Wait.

1:12:56.605 --> 1:12:57.472
Twin?

1:12:59.508 --> 1:13:01.142
She'll be a copy of you.

1:13:01.144 --> 1:13:03.544
Same skills,
same likes and dislikes,
same personality,

1:13:03.546 --> 1:13:05.947
but an entirely
separate awareness.

1:13:07.750 --> 1:13:09.016
So there'll be
two of me then?

1:13:14.156 --> 1:13:17.024
Once the electrodes
are removed,

1:13:17.026 --> 1:13:19.527
the host brain
can repair itself
because it's still young.

1:13:21.430 --> 1:13:22.764
But your older brain can't.

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:26.734
Your particular awareness
will cease to exist.

1:13:30.739 --> 1:13:32.106
You mean, I'm gonna die?

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.989
Your cloned brain will wake up
in the new body
with all your memories,

1:13:47.991 --> 1:13:51.025
and since she knows
nothing else, she'll
believe she's you.

1:14:01.136 --> 1:14:04.005
But this is still Jules' only
chance, though, isn't it?

1:14:07.743 --> 1:14:08.609
Please don't do this.

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:10.678
I want

1:14:11.747 --> 1:14:12.613
Christmas with her first.

1:14:19.621 --> 1:14:20.488
And, Dave,

1:14:24.026 --> 1:14:26.160
Jules can never know.

1:14:36.538 --> 1:14:38.139
Gwen needed you to perform
without misgivings.

1:14:39.875 --> 1:14:41.742
So I excluded this memory
from the transfer.

1:14:52.054 --> 1:14:54.889
She gave away her life
with her daughter.

1:14:54.891 --> 1:14:56.591
There's nothing inside of you
that knows what that meant.

1:15:00.195 --> 1:15:01.229
There's nothing left.

1:15:47.776 --> 1:15:49.076
Sales are
through the roof.

1:15:49.078 --> 1:15:50.111
Was I someone else before?

1:15:52.848 --> 1:15:53.714
Body donor.

1:15:55.817 --> 1:15:58.819
Do you remember my last
conversation with Gwen
in the holding room?

1:16:03.625 --> 1:16:07.695
Can you feel that part of her
reaching through you
towards her little girl?

1:16:15.203 --> 1:16:16.170
That part is lost.

1:16:21.310 --> 1:16:23.911
Just inform me if you need
any additional changes.

1:17:14.896 --> 1:17:16.230
Did you kill her?

1:17:19.735 --> 1:17:20.868
She did this.

1:17:27.109 --> 1:17:28.743
She's gone, Jules.

1:17:28.745 --> 1:17:28.976
I'm sorry.

1:17:33.215 --> 1:17:34.215
I don't believe you.

1:17:38.387 --> 1:17:39.253
She wouldn't do that.

1:18:09.051 --> 1:18:11.118
I can't seem to find my...

1:18:13.288 --> 1:18:14.288
Medicine.

1:18:20.896 --> 1:18:22.797
I'm not gonna be here
for anyone else.

1:18:29.237 --> 1:18:31.772
I'm not gonna be here
for any other reason.

1:20:50.946 --> 1:20:51.612
What's wrong?

1:20:55.584 --> 1:20:56.951
I don't really know
why I'm alive.

1:21:05.293 --> 1:21:06.160
Doesn't matter.

1:21:08.063 --> 1:21:09.463
Whatever you do will be
wonderful and worthwhile.

1:21:12.334 --> 1:21:13.400
How do you know?

1:21:16.137 --> 1:21:17.004
I know because you're kind.

1:21:22.944 --> 1:21:24.445
People say being kind
is being weak.

1:21:31.219 --> 1:21:32.419
You're alive because
of energy

1:21:34.089 --> 1:21:35.155
and empathy.

1:21:37.626 --> 1:21:40.427
Your mother had
so much of it inside of her,
she needed to get it out.

1:21:41.663 --> 1:21:42.997
So she made you.

1:21:44.366 --> 1:21:45.499
You're starting to
sound like her.

1:23:25.567 --> 1:23:26.767
I'm sweating.

1:23:26.769 --> 1:23:27.634
I hate sweating.

1:23:29.437 --> 1:23:30.537
Are they late?

1:23:30.539 --> 1:23:33.307
Relax.

1:23:33.309 --> 1:23:35.009
Let's do the meditation thing
you learned at camp.

1:23:36.211 --> 1:23:37.044
That was fun.
