WEBVTT

00:36.494 --> 00:38.705
-Be careful!

01:03.313 --> 01:04.147


01:04.230 --> 01:06.107
-What do you think?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.525
I love it!

01:07.609 --> 01:09.277
I even stuffed a sock down one side.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.739
Wow. You're really covering
all your bases, and then some.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.284
If you could rustle up some people to come
to the club tonight, that'd be amazing.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.286
I need to prove
that I can bring in customers,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.997
especially ones that order drinks.
Lots of drinks.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.415
-

01:36.638 --> 01:39.724
Are you okay?
You look like you just lost a follower.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.018
No, but maybe a friend.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.353
Camille.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.523
I haven't spoken to her since
Gabriel told me he was staying in Paris,

01:46.606 --> 01:47.857
and now I have to go to Savoir

01:47.941 --> 01:50.068
to meet with her
about her family champagne.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.737
What's the problem?
Her boyfriend's staying in Paris.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.573
Yeah… Um, here's the thing.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.284
When I went to say goodbye to Gabriel,

01:58.368 --> 02:02.330
it somehow turned into
the most incredible night of sex

02:02.413 --> 02:04.582
that I have ever had in my entire life!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.543
Emily! Get it, girl!

02:06.626 --> 02:07.877
-No!
-No.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.588
I thought that
I was never gonna see him again.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.633
It's like I came to Paris,
and suddenly I'm Pam Spicer.

02:13.716 --> 02:14.801
Who's Pam Spicer?

02:14.884 --> 02:16.970
Just this girl from Chicago
who'd get really drunk

02:17.053 --> 02:19.013
-and then hit on everyone's boyfriends.
-Oh.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.933
Yeah, it was like
kind of a joke, until it wasn't.

02:22.016 --> 02:25.436
Aren't you planning a romantic weekend
in St Tropez with Mathieu?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.147
After the other night, I'm not so sure.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.232
No, that's the perfect alibi.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.025
Yeah…

02:40.410 --> 02:41.244
Wow.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.246
You're taking the name down already.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.415
Out with the old, in with the new.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.917
What are you gonna call it?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.211
Antoine wants to call it "Chez Lavaux."

02:50.295 --> 02:54.132
I was more thinking about "Chez Gabriel."
Unless you have a better idea.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.052
Gabriel, I'm meeting
with Camille at Savoir today.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.430
-Oh.
-What have you told her?

03:00.513 --> 03:03.099
That I'm staying in Paris,
thanks to Antoine's investment.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.227
And I'm staying in Paris, thanks to a job.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.273
For a year. Then I'm going
back to Chicago, to my real life.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.568
I certainly never meant
to interfere in anyone's relationship.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.154
It's like I violated
the Prime Directive.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.530
The Prime Directive?

03:17.614 --> 03:18.698
It's from <i>Star Trek.</i>

03:18.781 --> 03:20.950
-Oh.
-My dad was a huge Trekkie,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.119
and made me watch
all the original episodes.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.080
The Prime Directive prohibits
any members of the Starfleet

03:26.164 --> 03:29.334
from interfering with the lives
of alien civilizations.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.586
But in this case, you're the alien.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.091
You're not supposed to be in Paris.
And I can't do this to Camille.

03:37.175 --> 03:40.637
You didn't do anything to Camille.
You did do a lot of things to me.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.556
Emily, good morning.
Welcome to Maison Lavaux.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.642
The name is still under discussion.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.229
But it's a good one,
don't you think? And a brand extension.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.064
I'm sure Emily can appreciate that.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.274
I actually don't have
an opinion.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.443
Come to our tasting dinner
tomorrow night.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.320
Maybe you'll have an opinion by then.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.405
Unfortunately, I can't make it.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.492
I will be in St Tropez
with Mathieu Cadault.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.285
Seriously?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.120
Lucky man.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.373
Uh…

04:09.040 --> 04:09.874
<i>Au revoir.</i>

04:23.471 --> 04:25.265
Good morning,
I was thinking of…

04:26.933 --> 04:28.059
Is that for Champère?

04:28.142 --> 04:30.812
Yes. Just a few ideas
I had to the campaign.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.064
Yes, that Luc prepared at my request.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.025
-I thought Champère was my account.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.568
Champagne is a French product.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.529
I thought it'd be better
if Luc handled things.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.741
Maybe that is a good idea. For now.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.119
Maybe I don't even need
to be in the meeting. Um,

04:46.202 --> 04:49.372
why don't I disappear for a few hours?
You can tell her I went home sick.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.958
-Why would we do that?
-What is your malady?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.461
Camille has arrived.
She is asking for you, Emily.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.088
She does not look happy.

04:57.171 --> 04:58.881
Actually, you do look pale.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.515
Camille!

05:08.308 --> 05:10.560
-I'm so happy to see you.
<i>-Ma chérie.</i>

05:13.479 --> 05:14.939
Is everything okay?

05:15.023 --> 05:17.900
Yeah, I just don't know
what to do about Gabriel.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.363
But it's a great thing for you guys.
He's staying in Paris. Yay!

05:22.447 --> 05:24.240
He's not staying for me.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.200
I know something else is behind this.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.244
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Camille.
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Sylvie.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.457
Thank you so much for coming.
And I believe you've met Luc.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.417
Oh, yes, I did, at the gallery. Yeah.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.587
Ah! Nice to see you again.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.214
-Shall we begin?
-Yep.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.215
Sure.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.399
We want to make Champère playful and sexy.

05:58.983 --> 06:02.695
An aperitif that becomes an aphrodisiac.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.159
Spray it, don't say it! Champère.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.832
Also, there is a trendy club in St Tropez
that Sylvie has connections to.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.542
They will also promote the champagne.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.962
L'oranger. Right, Sylvie?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.715
Well, I suppose if it'll help.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.845
Right now, what would really help
is having lunch with you.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.432
Lunch? Yes. To discuss the account.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.227
Uh, Sylvie? Would you like to join?

06:34.811 --> 06:35.812
Please.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.940
I'd love to.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.531
So Gabriel has decided
to stay in Paris,

06:46.614 --> 06:50.952
and it was a very sudden decision,
and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.703
Are we talking about the chef?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.621
Mmm-hmm.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.832
Yes, Camille's boyfriend.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.708
And after almost five years together,

06:57.792 --> 07:00.545
he decides he wants
to move back home to Normandy

07:00.628 --> 07:02.338
to open his own restaurant.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.675
Normandy? <i>Oh, la, la.</i>
My least favorite place in France.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.802
Damp beaches and apple cider.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.097
I can't imagine you there.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.474
-I mean, even love has limits.
-Exactly.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.726
But now he's staying in Paris.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.604
-And I know why.
-You do?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.440
Mmm-hmm.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.024
It involves a man.

07:23.025 --> 07:23.901
Oh.

07:23.985 --> 07:24.986
So he's gay.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.031
No. I'm talking about
the man who's investing

07:29.115 --> 07:30.992
in Gabriel's restaurant, Antoine Lambert.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.869
Antoine is backing the chef?

07:32.952 --> 07:37.206
Yeah. I mean, when my family
offered him money to follow his dreams,

07:37.290 --> 07:41.377
he refused and decided
to leave Paris and leave me.

07:41.461 --> 07:46.424
And now this stranger comes along,
and he decides he wants to stay.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.301
And that's a good thing.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.387
-No?
-No.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.932
I mean, how can I go back
to a man whose ego is so fragile

07:55.016 --> 07:59.020
that he'd rather move away
than accept my family's support?

07:59.103 --> 08:02.523
Oh, men and their egos.
Yeah, I understand completely.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.402
It's not just about the money.
He's acting weird.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.237
Like, he's staying here,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.615
and he didn't call me
to say what's really going on.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.992
I'm sure he's just busy
with the new restaurant.

08:13.075 --> 08:13.910
No.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.747
There is something else behind this.
I just don't know yet what it is.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.042
Anyway, I'm going to <i>les toilettes.</i>

08:21.125 --> 08:23.794
Does anyone have a euro for <i>la dame pipi?</i>

08:23.878 --> 08:25.171
<i>La dame</i> who?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.174
Uh, the woman who sits outside the loo.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.426
Thanks, honey.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.057
So you're having an affair
with the chef, aren't you?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.352
-No.
-He sent you lingerie. I remember.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.187
That was a misunderstanding.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.232
Yeah, now we know
where he got his good taste from.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.191
Antoine.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.694
This is starting to make sense.

08:48.778 --> 08:53.115
Gabriel is not staying in Paris for me.
Okay? Camille is my friend.

08:53.199 --> 08:57.078
Oh, those are two
totally unrelated statements.

08:57.161 --> 09:00.248
Oh, Emily, you're getting
more French by the day.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.583
I'm not having an affair with Gabriel.

09:03.251 --> 09:07.338
You know, I'm actually going
to St Tropez this weekend with Mathieu.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.758
Oh, I see.
Focus on having sex with a client

09:10.841 --> 09:13.219
to get your mind off
your friend's boyfriend.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.304
Are those the new rules?

09:16.305 --> 09:18.057
Oh, my God.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.684
<i>Garçon!</i>

09:19.767 --> 09:21.852
Waiter,
may I have an ashtray, please?

09:36.200 --> 09:39.787
Guys, can you come see my roommate
and incredibly talented friend

09:39.870 --> 09:41.330
perform in a drag club tonight?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.666
-Oh, I hate drag.
-No, she's really talented.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.751
-She?
-It's complicated.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.630
You're distracting me while I'm preparing
for one of my first presentations.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.340
For Rimowa luggage.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.718
-Can I see?
-You'll hear it in the meeting.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.637
Ah…

09:56.721 --> 09:59.682
I love drag shows.
Let me know, I'll be there.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.434
Great. I'll text you the details.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.476
-Great.
-Okay.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.567
For Rimowa, which is such an iconic brand,

10:09.650 --> 10:11.652
we wanted to create a playful campaign

10:11.736 --> 10:14.697
while showcasing the line's
fresh but classic styling.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.282
Our tagline?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.035
"Keep your baggage to yourself."

10:19.118 --> 10:20.119
Take notes, Emily.

10:20.202 --> 10:24.248
We want to lean into the idea of luggage
as personal and intimate.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.876
And, of course,
Rimowa is built securely enough

10:26.959 --> 10:28.461
to carry your secrets safely.

10:30.129 --> 10:34.342
The things people pack in their
luggage, I'm sure you can imagine…

10:34.967 --> 10:39.180
It's also a metaphor
for our personal baggage…

10:39.263 --> 10:41.766
Yes. We understand.

10:41.849 --> 10:46.312
We were hoping
to do something a little noisier.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.731
Like what you did with Pierre Cadault.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.905
Maybe we can do a collab with Pierre.

10:55.988 --> 11:00.951
Uh, a <i>ringarde</i> piece of luggage.
Something really tacky.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.080
That would be amusing.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.006
What do you think?
A collab with Pierre and Rimowa.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.218
-I think it's a win-win.
-<i>I'll talk to Pierre about it.</i>

11:17.301 --> 11:19.720
Collabs are his thing now, thanks to you.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.099
What do you think about his face
covering a gigantic suitcase?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.936
You certainly know
how to play into his ego, don't you?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.939
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>I booked a night train tomorrow.</i>

11:30.022 --> 11:31.607
We'll have our own couchettes.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.067
Oh!

11:33.150 --> 11:35.444
Like a <i>couchette coucher?</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:37.780
Exactly. You do know a little French.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.657
Well, it's that phrase. Everyone knows it.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.575
Do you want to sleep with me?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.036
Well, if you insist.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.124
See you tomorrow.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.208
Can't wait.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.969
I just spoke to Mathieu.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.346
He's gonna ask Pierre
about the collab with Rimowa.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.806
Fingers crossed.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.476
I didn't ask for your help, Emily.
It's my account.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.937
I know. And you'll get the credit.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.663
I looked at your paperwork.
You left a lot blank.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.331
I need to see your work permit.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.209
Oh… the work permit. I have it at home.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.502
Yeah, right.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.213
Until I see it,
you'll be working for tips.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.506
Outside the toilets.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.183
-Hi, let me grab my coat.
-Hi. Sure.

12:48.017 --> 12:52.062
Oh, my God! Your apartment is so cute.
I've never been here before.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.524
Oh, thank you.
It's a little tight for two people.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.151
I love the location.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.904
Ugh!

12:59.987 --> 13:03.073
I can't even see an omelet pan
without thinking of Gabriel.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.242
He had one just like that.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.077
All French pans look alike.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.538
He actually had his initials on it and--

13:09.622 --> 13:11.457
-We're gonna be late. Come on.
-Oh, sure.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.851
Please give it up
for Claudette Monette.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.358
You know, it's been a while.
When do we get to see Mindy?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.276
I don't know,
but I wanna go to the bathroom.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.195
-I don't want to miss her.
-Wait.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.365
Here is the euro I owe you.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.575
For <i>la dame pipi.</i>

13:47.952 --> 13:49.703
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.546
Mindy!

13:58.629 --> 14:00.256
Emily, I told you not to come!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.258
You're <i>la dame pipi?</i>

14:02.341 --> 14:05.719
I… Without papers,
this is the best they could offer me.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.096
Is it worth it?

14:07.888 --> 14:09.473
Well, they promised me a song.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.684
Oh.

14:12.601 --> 14:16.021
I'm also <i>la dame</i> poo-poo.
It comes with the territory.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.316
And now,
straight from the toilettes…

14:19.400 --> 14:21.610
<i>Merde.</i> That's me. Pee fast!

14:21.694 --> 14:25.197
Please welcome and give
a round of applause to our very own

14:25.281 --> 14:26.657
Dame Pipi!

16:25.567 --> 16:29.154
Please show your love
for <i>la dame pipi!</i> Wasn't that amazing?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.364
I'm Mindy,

16:30.447 --> 16:34.451
I'll be in <i>le</i> room <i>pipi</i> all night,
so find me!

16:38.414 --> 16:40.499
-You were incredible!

16:41.166 --> 16:42.167
Oh, careful.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.836
I'm sorry.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.299
Oh, €20. Thank you, bye.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.137
-She's a woman, right?
-Definitely.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.348
Either way, it doesn't matter.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.309
-You go, all right!

17:04.815 --> 17:07.234
Do you have to sit outside
the toilets every night?

17:07.317 --> 17:09.403
As long as they let me sing, I'm good.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.239
By the way, someone tipped me
with a tab of ecstasy.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.116
Or a French Tic Tac, I'm not sure.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.118
-Whoop.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.829
Well, thank you guys for tonight.
I needed this.

17:19.955 --> 17:23.959
The lights are on. He's still there.
Why don't you go talk to him?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.504
If he wants me back,
he's gonna have to work for it.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.339
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hmm.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.340
Okay.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.385
Good evening.
-Goodnight<i>.</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:34.762
-Bye!
-Bye!

17:39.016 --> 17:41.018
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

17:42.352 --> 17:43.562
I do.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.330
<i>Bonjour.</i>

18:01.413 --> 18:03.207
Delivery for Emily Cooper.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.292
-I'll take it, thank you.
-From Rimowa.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.392
Emily!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.021
Oh, my--

18:26.105 --> 18:28.148
After all the support I have shown you.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.193
Now you come in here
and steal the one account I have?

18:31.276 --> 18:32.486
It's still your account.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.571
Then why was the suitcase
delivered to you?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.283
<i>Oh, la, la.</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:43.497
Now you really
do need Mathieu's approval, huh?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.792
No, I think you already have that. No?

18:48.669 --> 18:53.715
That's it. From now,
we are competitors. Not friends.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.350
We are doing
a total renovation.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.979
Much more of a bar scene,
but still refined cuisine.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.523
And we are calling it "Chez Lavaux."

19:10.190 --> 19:12.234
The Costes brothers better watch out.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.945
Excuse me, I'm going to check
with the chef about dinner.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.411
We've got some hungry people out there.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.121
I hope they'll like it.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.664
Tripe?

19:25.747 --> 19:28.000
With apple cider.
It's a local dish from Normandy.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.253
I thought we agreed.
We aren't doing cuisine from Normandy.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.422
It's one dish. An homage to my roots.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.883
No tripe. I beg you.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.102
Wow! That's a statement.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.188
It's <i>ringarde.</i> That's the point.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.983
Ooh. Tacky, got it. Cool. Here.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.153
-Are you okay?
-Yeah! I'm great.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.906
I'm going to have a wonderful,
romantic weekend

19:58.989 --> 20:02.659
with a nice, handsome,
single man who I like a lot.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.036
He's booked us a couchette,

20:04.119 --> 20:07.623
which, by the way,
is a sleeper car with bunk beds, so.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.833
-Don't judge me.
-I'm not judging you.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.252
Okay, good. I'll text you from St Tropez.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.795
Ooh! Sexy!

20:14.796 --> 20:17.090
-Do you need help? Okay.
-No, I got it.

20:19.009 --> 20:19.885
Wow!

20:20.469 --> 20:21.386
All right.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.473
We're good.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.650
Hey.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.026
-Hello.
-Oh!

20:36.568 --> 20:37.402
Hi.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.739
You're never gonna have a problem
finding your luggage at the airport.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.658
I know! It's a lot.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.203
I think Pierre's gonna love it. So tacky.

20:47.871 --> 20:48.914
All right, just here.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.290
Oh, okay.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.501
Hold on, let me help you.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.295
Oh!

21:11.561 --> 21:13.689
I don't think there's room here
for the three of us.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.441
-I'm gonna check this with the porter.
-Thank you.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.359
Top or bottom?

21:20.153 --> 21:21.822
Okay.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.615
<i>Et voilà.</i>

21:23.699 --> 21:25.742
Tripe <i>à la</i> Normandy.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.537
For those that haven't tried it,
you're in for a treat.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.466
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

21:45.804 --> 21:47.264
Gabriel, that tripe…

21:48.724 --> 21:49.558
Antoine,

21:50.350 --> 21:53.103
with all due respect,
if you can't trust me in the kitchen,

21:53.186 --> 21:54.271
then what am I doing here?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.149
I was just going to say it is delicious.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.109
You were right.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.361
You're a man
who fights for his convictions.

22:01.945 --> 22:02.779
I like that.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.380
Emily, where are you?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.008
I'm on a train.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.427
On the way to St Tropez with Mathieu.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.388
I can't believe
the girl I stayed in Paris for

22:28.472 --> 22:29.639
doesn't want to be with me.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.350
Please stop saying that.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.643
Stop saying that you stayed for me.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.979
Tell me that night wasn't amazing.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.690
You said that you were leaving.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.859
Tell me you didn't feel
everything that I felt.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.111
I can't do this to Camille.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.238
I don't want to hurt Camille either.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.157
But I can't stop thinking about you.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.409
About us.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.207
And I can't stop thinking about you.
Okay? But I have to.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.085
<i>I have to stop thinking about you,</i>
<i>which isn't easy.</i>

22:58.168 --> 23:00.921
I don't think that I've ever
felt things like that with anyone.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.381
Then don't go.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.426
Gabriel, it was a night
that I will never forget, okay?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.178
-But it was a mista--

23:10.097 --> 23:11.640
I have to go.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.392
<i>Emily?</i>

23:14.059 --> 23:15.060
Emily.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.693
Was that the chef?

23:25.946 --> 23:29.699
You slept with him after you agreed
to come with me to St Tropez?

23:30.200 --> 23:32.244
Mathieu, it's really complicated.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.871
Let me make it simple then.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.873
Are you in love with him?

23:41.628 --> 23:44.214
Sorry. I can't do this.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.175
Wait, where are you going?

23:48.552 --> 23:51.763
I won't go to St Tropez with a girl
who's in love with someone else.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.183
The hotel room is yours.
Have fun with your boyfriend.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.062
Ah…

24:00.272 --> 24:01.273
Wait!

24:03.233 --> 24:04.484
No, it's too late.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.320
Uh…

24:08.488 --> 24:09.489
Wait!

24:10.115 --> 24:12.117
Mathieu, he's not my boyfriend!

24:12.200 --> 24:13.785
He's not my boyfriend!
