00:29.321 --> 00:32.073
Come to me, Kali.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.285
I conjure thee, Kali.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.454
Come to me, Kali.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.332
I conjure thee, Kali.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.208
<i>I'm here, Aviva.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:48.882
<i>- It's been over a week.
- I know. Be patient, Aviva.</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:50.884
But I've done everything
that you've asked.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.887
I've followed the Halliwell sisters.
I know their every move.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.557
<i>Which will all become valuable
in good time.</i>

00:57.724 --> 00:59.350
<i>You must trust me.</i>

00:59.517 --> 01:02.854
<i>You must make them want you
as badly as you want them.</i>

01:06.524 --> 01:09.527
<i>- I talked to my mom today.
- How is she?</i>

01:09.694 --> 01:11.112
I don't know.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.198
She's better, I think.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.159
I miss her.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.580
<i>- She's going to be so proud of you.
- Yeah?</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:22.081
I hope so.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.459
<i>Are you ready
to receive your power?</i>

01:26.252 --> 01:29.922
<i>- You know I am.
- Remember, it's a sacred power.</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:34.802
<i>If I give it to you,
you must use it only as I say.</i>

01:35.136 --> 01:37.764
I will. I promise.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.432
<i>Very well.</i>

01:39.599 --> 01:42.393
<i>Reach for the mirror,
put out your hands,</i>

01:42.560 --> 01:44.353
<i>feel the power.</i>

02:04.498 --> 02:06.250
<i>You know what to do.</i>

02:06.417 --> 02:09.377
<i>Go to Phoebe, Piper and Prue.</i>

02:42.619 --> 02:47.291
Well, I think I see... Yeah,
there's definitely something here.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.667
Definitely.

02:50.794 --> 02:53.714
My, Santa, you've changed.

02:53.881 --> 02:56.675
- He's looking for Kit.
- The cat. Right.

02:56.842 --> 02:59.595
Four legs, fur. I remember.

03:05.642 --> 03:08.478
Sorry. You know,
have you tried the shelter?

03:08.645 --> 03:11.106
- Yeah, nothing.
- Well, she had her collar on, right?

03:11.273 --> 03:12.524
With your number on it?

03:12.691 --> 03:17.321
- A very distinctive collar, actually.
- Anyway, thanks for looking.

03:17.487 --> 03:19.406
I'm sure you must be hungry
after all that work.

03:19.573 --> 03:20.949
All what work?

03:22.909 --> 03:26.038
Oh, that's just Piper.
She's gotta be everyone's mom.

03:26.204 --> 03:29.082
Think of her as your mom.
I know I do.

03:31.293 --> 03:33.170
Isn't she a scream?

03:33.670 --> 03:35.589
Well, thanks.

03:36.047 --> 03:40.051
Let me go put these fliers up first,
and I'll be right back, okay?

03:40.218 --> 03:44.097
- Oh, careful. You all right? Careful.
- Yeah, I'll just...

03:44.264 --> 03:45.849
- Antique.
- Thanks.

03:46.057 --> 03:48.059
Grandma's, yeah.

03:49.644 --> 03:52.689
Quite possibly the finest glutes
in the city.

03:52.856 --> 03:54.774
- In the state.
- In all the land.

03:54.941 --> 03:57.027
I saw him first.

06:34.391 --> 06:36.852
Here you go, Leo.
Non-fat milk, right?

06:37.018 --> 06:40.105
- Thanks.
- Just don't call me "Mom."

06:40.772 --> 06:44.067
Trust me, one hot night is all
you guys need to get back on track.

06:44.234 --> 06:48.071
- Yeah, I hope you're right.
- Andy's a cop, you're a witch.

06:48.238 --> 06:49.823
Expect complications.

06:49.990 --> 06:52.951
- Hey, Leo. How's it going?
- Good.

06:53.118 --> 06:57.372
This wall only needs two coats, then
I gotta do the moulding, and I'm done.

06:58.999 --> 07:01.042
Are you sure
it doesn't need three coats?

07:02.294 --> 07:05.797
Nice outfit for 9:00 in the morning
with no place to go.

07:06.923 --> 07:08.091
I'm glad you like it.

07:10.552 --> 07:12.971
Leo, come here.

07:15.056 --> 07:16.099
Got milk?

07:18.977 --> 07:20.103
Phoebe, come here.

07:22.897 --> 07:24.524
Phoebe!

07:28.778 --> 07:31.864
I think that Piper likes Leo.

07:32.031 --> 07:34.575
What's not to like?
He's a great guy.

07:34.909 --> 07:39.122
- I mean, really likes him.
- Your point being?

07:40.623 --> 07:44.210
- Never mind. Classic Phoebe.
- Wait, define that.

07:44.377 --> 07:45.461
I think you know.

07:46.796 --> 07:49.841
Okay, look, Prue, I think we need to
put some major closure on this,

07:50.007 --> 07:53.344
or we're gonna be in rocking chairs,
slurping oatmeal out of rubber spoons,

07:53.511 --> 07:56.097
and I'm still gonna hear
about Roger.

07:56.264 --> 07:58.808
Piper, am I a boyfriend thief?

07:58.975 --> 08:00.101
Totally.

08:00.268 --> 08:03.521
Besides Roger, whom again, Prue,
I never touched.

08:03.688 --> 08:05.898
My boyfriend, Billy Wilson.

08:08.025 --> 08:13.739
- Billy Wil... Eighth grade Billy Wilson?
- You kissed him at homecoming.

08:13.906 --> 08:18.369
No, I did not kiss him at homecoming.
I was helping him find a contact lens.

08:18.536 --> 08:23.332
Oh, please. You were all over him,
with your breasts all... Whatever.

08:23.499 --> 08:27.461
- I didn't even have breasts back then.
- Phoebe, you've always had breasts.

08:29.088 --> 08:32.424
So I think I'll just let you two
work this out on your own,

08:32.591 --> 08:35.385
but just remember, I get the house
tonight. Just Andy and me.

08:35.553 --> 08:38.681
No warlocks, no innocents to protect
and especially no sisters.

08:43.602 --> 08:45.104
So you know...

08:45.271 --> 08:48.691
...it's not like either one of us
has a problem finding guys.

08:49.984 --> 08:51.110
Please.

08:51.277 --> 08:55.447
So if one of us got Leo,
it'd be okay with the other one.

08:55.864 --> 08:56.907
Absolutely.

08:57.074 --> 09:00.536
So we can just consider this
a friendly competition.

09:01.161 --> 09:02.871
- Sibling rivalry.
- War.

09:03.038 --> 09:05.541
Exactly.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.010
Dear Diary...

09:17.594 --> 09:19.429
Aviva, open the door.

09:19.596 --> 09:21.807
...life sucks here.

09:21.974 --> 09:24.643
I'm gonna be late for work.

09:26.103 --> 09:29.856
So that part about this being my room,
that was a lie?

09:30.023 --> 09:31.692
It's my apartment, Aviva.

09:31.858 --> 09:34.945
So you keep reminding me,
Aunt Jackie.

09:36.738 --> 09:38.281
Why don't you get light
and air in here?

09:38.448 --> 09:41.410
Because I like it dark and stale.

09:42.369 --> 09:44.788
Why are you so antagonistic to me?

09:45.247 --> 09:47.082
How come you haven't called
my mom yet?

09:47.249 --> 09:49.626
- What?
- To see how she's doing.

09:49.793 --> 09:52.295
Or just to say hello.
It would help her, you know.

09:52.462 --> 09:54.881
I mean, it's not like
she's got a lot of family.

09:55.048 --> 09:57.092
She has to take responsibility
for her own actions.

09:57.259 --> 09:59.344
She's not in jail.
She's in rehab.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.806
She didn't do anything wrong
to take responsibility for.

10:02.973 --> 10:06.434
She's sick, and that's it.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

10:06.601 --> 10:08.186
Whatever.

10:17.362 --> 10:19.030
<i>Have you seen
Lethal Weapon 3?</i>

10:19.197 --> 10:21.324
Not very romantic.

10:21.825 --> 10:23.451
Right.

10:23.618 --> 10:26.871
<i>Hey, how about Double Indemnity?</i>

10:30.458 --> 10:31.751
It's black and white.

10:33.086 --> 10:36.381
- Right.
- Video paralysis.

10:36.631 --> 10:37.799
Excuse me?

10:37.966 --> 10:41.135
You're probably two minutes away
from leaving without a rental.

10:41.302 --> 10:45.348
You mind if I help?
After all, I am a pro.

10:45.556 --> 10:47.058
Sure.

10:51.479 --> 10:53.481
Doesn't really matter
what we pick anyway.

10:53.981 --> 10:55.900
Probably never get around
to watching it.

10:57.151 --> 10:58.945
Oh, yeah?

10:59.112 --> 11:01.072
Pretty cocky.

11:02.365 --> 11:05.201
Actually, what I meant was
something always seems to come up,

11:05.368 --> 11:07.453
- get in our way.
- That's not true.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.541
Okay, well, maybe
sometimes it's true,

11:11.707 --> 11:13.417
but there's always
a perfectly good reason.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.711
Prue, there's never
a perfectly good reason.

11:15.878 --> 11:18.256
As a matter of fact, there's never
usually a reason at all.

11:18.422 --> 11:20.508
Good, bad or otherwise.

11:20.675 --> 11:22.301
All right.

11:22.718 --> 11:26.931
You, me, alone tonight.

11:27.098 --> 11:31.685
Nothing, and I mean nothing,
will get in our way. Guaranteed.

11:31.852 --> 11:33.187
I'll hold you to that.

11:33.854 --> 11:35.606
Okay.

11:37.108 --> 11:38.651
I got it.

11:38.818 --> 11:40.611
<i>Body Heat.</i>

11:40.778 --> 11:42.780
We'll take it.

11:43.614 --> 11:46.075
I conjure thee, Kali.

11:47.409 --> 11:48.911
<i>I'm here, Aviva.</i>

11:49.370 --> 11:52.164
I'm going crazy here, Kali.
I can't wait any longer.

11:52.331 --> 11:54.792
<i>The Halliwells don't understand
our way.</i>

11:54.959 --> 11:58.253
<i>They don't yet know the full uses
and joys of their powers.</i>

11:58.420 --> 12:01.548
<i>- I'll show them.
- You must gain their trust first.</i>

12:01.715 --> 12:04.385
<i>You must let them welcome you
into their coven.</i>

12:04.677 --> 12:06.887
I won't disappoint you.
I swear.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.515
<i>Then it's time.</i>

12:19.566 --> 12:22.194
<i>Take the cat
back to the Halliwells.</i>

12:38.168 --> 12:40.212
About done for the day?

12:40.379 --> 12:42.422
Just about.

12:42.839 --> 12:45.342
Well, Prue has a date tonight,
so we kind of gotta clear out.

12:45.509 --> 12:47.844
I was thinking about catching
a movie. Wanna go?

12:48.011 --> 12:49.930
I can't do it.

12:50.388 --> 12:53.475
- Okay.
- You know...

12:55.018 --> 12:56.686
...these are original to the house.

12:57.229 --> 13:00.357
I mean, they really should be sanded
down, finished off with steel wool

13:01.066 --> 13:04.027
and restained, not covered in paint.

13:04.194 --> 13:06.029
Oh, right.

13:06.196 --> 13:08.615
Kind of like making risotto
with Minute Rice.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.118
It's a cooking analogy.

13:12.285 --> 13:13.328
Yeah.

13:15.038 --> 13:16.873
Anyway...

13:17.290 --> 13:19.501
...I have stain samples at home
if you're interested.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.670
I could bring them by tomorrow and
show them to you and your sisters.

13:22.837 --> 13:25.256
Better yet, why don't you just
bring them by the restaurant?

13:25.423 --> 13:29.177
Say about lunchtime? Prue's so busy,
and Phoebe doesn't really care.

13:29.344 --> 13:30.970
She's more into stucco.

13:31.346 --> 13:33.598
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:33.807 --> 13:35.099
So, what time is that movie?

13:35.600 --> 13:36.643
I got it.

13:39.103 --> 13:42.941
Kit! Oh, my God! Where did you
find her? We were worried sick.

13:43.107 --> 13:45.526
I was just walking by,
and I saw one of your fliers,

13:45.693 --> 13:48.696
and poof, there she was.
Like magic.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.202
I can't even believe
she let you hold her.

13:54.702 --> 13:57.747
Welcome home, kitty.

13:58.498 --> 14:01.751
- You must be starving.
- I fed her.

14:01.918 --> 14:03.836
I thought you said
you just found her.

14:04.003 --> 14:06.339
I did. Well, a couple of hours ago,
I mean.

14:06.506 --> 14:08.007
And she didn't try to scratch you?

14:08.591 --> 14:10.426
You know, I'll take
the fliers down tomorrow.

14:10.593 --> 14:13.804
- Let me clean up before the movie.
- Movie? What movie?

14:13.971 --> 14:16.599
- A war movie.
- I love war movies.

14:16.766 --> 14:19.310
- Mind if I tag along?
- Sure.

14:19.810 --> 14:22.647
Why not? I'll be right back.

14:23.481 --> 14:26.567
You guys aren't going out, are you?
You just got your cat back.

14:26.734 --> 14:29.528
Oh, she'll be fine.
Let me get my purse.

14:29.737 --> 14:33.074
- What's your name?
- Oh, no, no, I don't want your money.

14:33.866 --> 14:35.451
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey, Andy.

14:35.618 --> 14:36.660
Hey.

14:36.827 --> 14:39.246
Hey, I thought we all
had plans tonight.

14:39.413 --> 14:41.415
- This girl just found our cat for us.
- Aviva.

14:41.582 --> 14:43.709
Well, that's great.
Is 50 bucks enough?

14:45.336 --> 14:47.796
I don't want a reward.
We need to talk.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.174
- About what?
- About Wicca.

14:54.678 --> 14:59.099
Andy Trudeau, this is Leo Wyatt.
You guys chat. We'll be right back.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.392
- Okay.
- Hey.

15:00.559 --> 15:03.354
- Thanks again.
- Yeah, I'm sorry you can't stay.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.397
I'm not leaving.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.025
Don't you understand?
I'm one of you.

15:13.697 --> 15:15.282
No!

15:16.825 --> 15:18.452
Very cool.

15:22.748 --> 15:25.167
She didn't... She didn't...
You didn't freeze.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.337
- It's because I'm a witch too.
- A what?

15:29.630 --> 15:30.839
Look, I just wanna be friends.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.759
Guys, we have about 20 seconds
until they unfreeze.

15:33.926 --> 15:35.302
How did you find out about us?

15:35.469 --> 15:37.596
I'm gonna need
more than 20 seconds for that.

15:37.763 --> 15:39.514
We need to move things
along here, Prue.

15:39.681 --> 15:41.224
Okay, you need
to get out of here now.

15:41.391 --> 15:42.434
What? Why?

15:42.601 --> 15:44.519
We don't know who
you really are, so just leave.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.813
- Okay, go, go, go.
- No, I'm not leaving.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.649
- I just saved your cat.
- Leave now or else.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.151
Or else what?

16:03.914 --> 16:05.832
What the hell?

16:10.045 --> 16:12.422
Hey, where did that girl go?

16:12.589 --> 16:13.715
She just...

16:14.382 --> 16:15.926
Left.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.103
Why wouldn't they accept me?

16:27.270 --> 16:29.189
You said if I brought them back
their cat...

16:29.355 --> 16:32.358
<i>Was it the oldest?
Was it Prue who sent you away?</i>

16:32.901 --> 16:34.944
<i>- Yes.
- Avoid her.</i>

16:35.111 --> 16:37.822
<i>She's the strongest.
You must separate them.</i>

16:37.989 --> 16:40.200
<i>Together they're charmed,
impenetrable.</i>

16:40.617 --> 16:43.453
<i>- But what if they don't want me?
- Phoebe will.</i>

16:43.620 --> 16:46.623
<i>In her own way, she's searching
for someone to relate to.</i>

16:46.789 --> 16:50.126
<i>Someone to share
her witchcraft with.</i>

16:50.543 --> 16:52.045
<i>What's the problem?</i>

16:52.629 --> 16:54.714
I... I don't know.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.841
<i>You're the one who came to me,
remember?</i>

16:57.008 --> 16:59.552
<i>You're the one who wanted sisters.</i>

16:59.719 --> 17:02.221
I know I want a family.
I don't have anybody.

17:04.432 --> 17:08.770
What do you get out of it? I mean,
you know, you never really said...

17:08.935 --> 17:13.566
<i>Halliwell magic is old and powerful,
and I want it.</i>

17:13.733 --> 17:16.986
<i>And since they're new to the craft,
if I'm ever going to get it,</i>

17:17.153 --> 17:20.114
<i>it has to be now.
Through you.</i>

17:21.949 --> 17:23.326
<i>Just do as I say, Aviva.</i>

17:24.242 --> 17:29.582
<i>Make Phoebe covet your power,
then we'll both get what we want.</i>

17:35.713 --> 17:39.050
It's not what you think, Andy.
It's hard to explain. It just...

17:39.216 --> 17:41.093
Another one of those things
you can't explain.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.553
It's a broken record, Prue.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.055
Look, I wanted you to stay.
You have to believe me.

17:45.222 --> 17:47.016
What happened? Why'd you
want me to leave?

17:47.183 --> 17:49.018
I told you, something came up.
Sister stuff.

17:49.185 --> 17:52.563
I can't really go into detail
without betraying someone's secret.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.858
- Prue...
- Look, Andy, I'm unpredictable, okay?

17:56.025 --> 17:58.652
That is just part of who I am,
and you have to accept that,

17:58.819 --> 18:00.237
because I can't change it.

18:00.404 --> 18:03.490
I don't want you to change, Prue.
I just...

18:05.826 --> 18:09.038
I just wanna have a normal date,
that's all. Is that too much to ask for?

18:10.831 --> 18:16.003
All right, let's just try again tonight.
Same time, same place?

18:16.170 --> 18:17.212
Same movie?

18:20.466 --> 18:21.842
Yeah.

18:22.009 --> 18:24.219
Okay. So, what, 8:00?

18:24.678 --> 18:26.513
I'll be there. Bye.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.390
All right, bye.

18:30.267 --> 18:33.061
If I ever see that little arsonist again...

18:34.688 --> 18:38.233
Just got done dodging Leo's questions
about her. That was close.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.277
Too close.
The question is, who is she?

18:40.444 --> 18:43.697
- And what does she want?
- Let us not forget Aviva found Kit.

18:43.864 --> 18:46.533
Yeah, she's probably the one
who stole the cat in the first place.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.453
Hello, paranoia chick.

18:49.619 --> 18:51.663
Phoebe, for all we know,
she's a warlock.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.542
- She can't be. She didn't freeze.
- Besides, she said she was a witch.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.379
- Okay, a bad witch maybe.
- A bad witch with a really cool power.

18:59.546 --> 19:02.591
- Better than mine, that's for sure.
- Why are you so quick to defend her?

19:02.758 --> 19:04.843
Why are you so quick
to condemn her?

19:05.427 --> 19:08.889
If she is a witch, a good witch,
then it might be kind of cool,

19:09.055 --> 19:10.849
considering she's the first
we've run across.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.267
- Exactly.
- Guys,

19:12.434 --> 19:13.518
we don't know about her.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.896
How she got her powers,
how she found out about us.

19:16.062 --> 19:18.773
She tried to tell us,
but you kicked her out.

19:18.940 --> 19:22.110
Yeah, she would've exposed us
if I hadn't.

19:22.277 --> 19:23.737
Prue, she's just a kid.

19:24.362 --> 19:29.200
Besides, if she's a witch, she probably
feels just as alone as we do.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.994
Maybe she just needs some friends.

19:31.161 --> 19:33.872
Or maybe she's out to destroy us.
It wouldn't be the first time.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.832
- Okay.
- All right,

19:35.999 --> 19:40.253
until we know who she really is,
let's just steer clear, okay?

19:41.171 --> 19:42.922
I'm late for work.

19:43.590 --> 19:44.632
Me too.

19:51.389 --> 19:53.099
Hello.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.143
Aviva?

19:59.439 --> 20:01.983
I'm so glad that you came.

20:02.150 --> 20:04.068
I'm glad that you called, actually.

20:04.235 --> 20:07.280
- Bet you got a few questions, huh?
- A few.

20:07.447 --> 20:10.825
- What time does school let out?
- Now.

20:11.659 --> 20:13.828
Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, what are you doing?

20:13.995 --> 20:17.415
Oh, the same thing I'm sure you did
a thousand times.

20:17.582 --> 20:20.001
- Am I right?
- Well...

20:20.585 --> 20:22.587
I am right.

20:22.879 --> 20:25.047
You didn't tell your bitch sister
about this, did you?

20:25.214 --> 20:26.799
Hey, watch your mouth.

20:26.966 --> 20:29.719
Prue had every right to be upset
with what you did.

20:29.886 --> 20:32.680
It's funny how you knew that I was
talking about Prue and not Piper.

20:33.848 --> 20:36.934
Hey, come on, let's go for a ride.

20:37.101 --> 20:41.439
I'll tell you everything
that you want to know.

20:57.663 --> 20:59.290
Table for one, sir?

20:59.665 --> 21:04.211
- You own this place?
- No, I just run it.

21:06.297 --> 21:09.883
Actually, I used to be the chef here.

21:18.976 --> 21:20.853
I'm impressed.

21:21.020 --> 21:24.690
Good. I mean,
good that you came here.

21:24.857 --> 21:27.776
As opposed to the house
and Phoebe.

21:30.779 --> 21:32.239
How about those stain samples?

21:32.865 --> 21:36.243
I only brought the ones authentic to
the era in which the manor was built.

21:36.410 --> 21:37.995
Great.

21:38.579 --> 21:39.621
Hungry?

21:41.748 --> 21:43.041
Oh, it's on the house.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.295
You're big on food, aren't you?

21:46.587 --> 21:49.673
You know, and that's good. You know,
actually, in the Mayan culture,

21:49.840 --> 21:52.509
the cook was second in the hierarchy
only to the medicine man.

21:52.676 --> 21:55.804
Mayans? You know about Mayans.

21:56.263 --> 21:58.640
Well, you certainly are a handyman,
aren't you?

22:00.017 --> 22:02.728
So does Phoebe work here too?

22:02.894 --> 22:06.022
Phoebe, work? No, no, no.

22:06.189 --> 22:09.109
She's probably at her gay and lesbian
group right about now.

22:10.402 --> 22:11.695
So, what will it be?

22:17.284 --> 22:19.160
This is the dining room.

22:19.327 --> 22:21.830
This is the parlour.
That's the conservatory,

22:21.997 --> 22:24.332
which is really just a fancy name
for family room.

22:24.499 --> 22:27.919
This is so totally cool.
Oh, I love it here.

22:28.086 --> 22:30.880
And welcome to planet Leo.

22:31.631 --> 22:35.093
- You are lucky Miss Leo?
- Maybe.

22:35.260 --> 22:39.264
Doesn't he like you? I mean, how
could he not? You are so gorgeous.

22:39.431 --> 22:44.394
Well, you see, Piper and I sort of have
this little competition going over him.

22:44.561 --> 22:49.023
So just use your powers.
Cast a spell on him or something.

22:49.190 --> 22:51.985
- You do have powers, don't you?
- What makes you think I do?

22:52.152 --> 22:54.362
Please. You're a witch.

22:54.529 --> 22:58.032
Yeah, which brings us back
to how do you know that?

22:59.492 --> 23:01.411
You promised.

23:05.081 --> 23:07.709
I have this teacher.

23:07.875 --> 23:11.170
She's great. She's like my mom.
She told me.

23:11.337 --> 23:12.380
- Who is she?
- Another witch.

23:12.547 --> 23:14.507
Like a high priestess or something.

23:14.841 --> 23:17.760
She said you were the coolest,
that I would like you the best.

23:17.927 --> 23:21.055
- She was right.
- Well, I'd like to meet her sometime.

23:21.222 --> 23:22.682
Yeah?

23:23.433 --> 23:24.600
Is your room up there?

23:26.769 --> 23:30.857
Come on, I wanna share something
with you.

23:31.023 --> 23:32.984
You're gonna love it.
I promise.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.819
Come on.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.202
I like mirrors.
They never lie to you.

23:43.369 --> 23:46.330
They always tell the truth
whether you like it or not.

23:46.497 --> 23:49.291
It's basic black.
The colour of my soul.

23:49.458 --> 23:52.878
- Do you wanna try it?
- Your soul's not black.

23:53.045 --> 23:55.714
You know the feeling that I mean.
You're different.

23:55.881 --> 23:58.050
You know, you'll never want
what they want.

23:58.217 --> 24:02.930
You belong on the edge.
We aren't pink people, Phoebe.

24:05.599 --> 24:08.853
You wanna see something incredible?
Better yet, do you wanna try it?

24:09.019 --> 24:10.062
Try what?

24:10.229 --> 24:12.523
I'll show you my power
if you show me yours.

24:14.525 --> 24:16.568
Anybody home?

24:17.820 --> 24:19.780
Better not be.

24:20.739 --> 24:22.700
Don't be afraid.

24:27.621 --> 24:29.915
- Okay, now what?
- Watch.

24:36.088 --> 24:38.507
- She's giving it to you too.
- Who is?

24:38.674 --> 24:40.717
- Giving me what?
- The power.

24:41.260 --> 24:42.553
Here.

24:43.428 --> 24:44.471
Touch this.

24:49.685 --> 24:53.188
It's the power of heat.
Your hand is like the sun.

24:53.355 --> 24:54.564
Whoa.

24:55.274 --> 24:56.984
That's pretty cool, huh?

24:57.442 --> 24:58.944
Phoebe, are you...?

24:59.945 --> 25:02.114
- Prue.
- What are you doing?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.157
- Get out. This is her room.
- Aviva...

25:04.324 --> 25:06.785
No. She treats you worse
than my aunt treats me.

25:06.952 --> 25:09.830
- It's not right.
- It's okay. Relax.

25:20.882 --> 25:22.551
<i>Chianti, Body Heat.
What do you think?</i>

25:22.801 --> 25:27.180
- Prue, I can explain. Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

25:27.347 --> 25:28.848
Let me guess, rain check?

25:29.015 --> 25:30.642
- Andy...
- Prue, this is...

25:31.518 --> 25:33.561
- It's getting ridiculous.
- I know.

25:33.728 --> 25:35.939
Believe me, you have every right
to be upset,

25:36.106 --> 25:40.235
and I can't talk about it right now,
but I will. I promise.

25:40.402 --> 25:43.279
Tomorrow, Quake, 1:00, please?

25:44.239 --> 25:46.741
Okay. Tomorrow, 1:00.

25:51.621 --> 25:54.541
I am so sorry. I totally forgot.

25:54.707 --> 25:56.584
What is she doing here?
What's the matter with you?

25:56.751 --> 25:59.295
This is her house too, okay?
She can do whatever she wants.

25:59.462 --> 26:01.172
Aviva.

26:01.339 --> 26:04.092
- She's not what you think she is.
- She doesn't understand, Phoebe.

26:04.259 --> 26:06.719
She'll never understand.

26:16.562 --> 26:19.732
<i>If there were no Prue,
Phoebe would be with us now.</i>

26:19.899 --> 26:22.318
I hate her,
and I wish that she were dead.

26:22.485 --> 26:25.071
Aviva, what's going on?
Who's in there with you?

26:27.323 --> 26:29.492
You skipped school today,
and I wanna know why.

26:29.659 --> 26:30.952
Get out of my room!

26:31.119 --> 26:33.287
How dare you speak to me
in that tone!

26:33.454 --> 26:35.456
What's going on in here?

26:35.623 --> 26:39.502
I said, get out of my room!
Leave me alone, or I'll...

26:45.883 --> 26:47.218
Aunt Jackie!

26:49.971 --> 26:51.764
Oh, my God!

26:52.473 --> 26:54.058
Aunt Jackie!

27:13.702 --> 27:15.120
<i>What did you tell the police?</i>

27:15.287 --> 27:18.624
That the candle caught her dress
on fire, and she fell down the stairs.

27:18.791 --> 27:23.087
Oh, my God. What have I done?
I didn't mean to hurt her.

27:23.254 --> 27:25.172
<i>Your powers are growing.</i>

27:25.339 --> 27:27.132
I know, but as soon as
Aunt Jackie wakes up,

27:27.299 --> 27:29.301
she'll tell them
what really happened.

27:29.468 --> 27:31.011
<i>- I gotta get out of here.
- No!</i>

27:31.178 --> 27:32.680
Why not?

27:32.846 --> 27:35.265
<i>You must go back to the Halliwells.</i>

27:35.432 --> 27:37.851
<i>You must complete what you started.</i>

27:38.018 --> 27:41.063
<i>- But how?
- Piper won't stop you,</i>

27:41.230 --> 27:45.609
<i>and Phoebe's already an ally.
Only Prue stands in our way.</i>

27:46.235 --> 27:48.278
<i>You must use your powers.</i>

27:48.445 --> 27:51.782
<i>You must take Prue's place
in the power of three.</i>

27:54.785 --> 27:57.704
<i>Don't disappoint me, Aviva.</i>

27:57.871 --> 28:00.540
<i>You said you wanted a family.</i>

28:00.707 --> 28:03.043
<i>And now you'll have one.</i>

28:10.467 --> 28:11.635
Thanks.

28:11.802 --> 28:14.513
- You poor thing, you're shivering.
- I'm okay.

28:15.305 --> 28:16.765
I know that you don't like me,

28:16.932 --> 28:19.392
and I know the last thing
you wanna do is help me,

28:19.559 --> 28:22.896
but I don't know where else to turn.
I don't have anybody else.

28:23.271 --> 28:27.567
She's telling the truth.
Her aunt was admitted to the hospital.

28:27.734 --> 28:29.027
How is she? Is she okay?

28:29.194 --> 28:31.279
She has a broken arm
and a concussion.

28:31.655 --> 28:35.325
- How did she fall again?
- I don't know. I...

28:35.492 --> 28:37.077
I heard her scream,

28:37.244 --> 28:40.580
and then I found her on the floor,
and I called 911.

28:40.997 --> 28:44.292
I promise, if you just let me spend
the night and get some sleep,

28:44.459 --> 28:47.837
I'll tell you everything you wanna know
about me tomorrow.

28:48.004 --> 28:51.925
- She can't stay alone.
- She can sleep in my room.

28:52.342 --> 28:55.053
- No magic.
- I swear.

29:07.273 --> 29:11.236
<i>Now is the time.</i>

29:41.182 --> 29:42.725
What are you doing?

29:44.852 --> 29:47.730
- I was just looking for the bathroom.
- Down the hall, to the right.

29:47.897 --> 29:50.816
Great. Thanks. Good night.

30:10.920 --> 30:14.882
I'm going to the hospital to see
her aunt. In an hour, I'll be back, okay?

30:16.383 --> 30:19.094
- Sorry, didn't know you were there.
- That's okay.

30:19.261 --> 30:21.555
I'm gonna see your aunt
and let her know where you are.

30:21.722 --> 30:24.558
- We'll talk when I get back?
- Yeah. Sure.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.852
- Tell her I love her.
- Okay.

30:27.019 --> 30:29.605
Come on, let's get something to eat.

30:34.526 --> 30:36.779
I don't understand.
Why is Aviva staying with you?

30:36.945 --> 30:39.365
I don't even know who you are.

30:39.531 --> 30:41.867
Well, actually,
we just met your niece.

30:42.034 --> 30:44.244
We lost our cat,
and she found it for us.

30:44.411 --> 30:47.539
- Oh, that's what she was hiding.
- Hiding?

30:47.706 --> 30:50.375
In the closet. She wouldn't let me
go anywhere near it.

30:50.542 --> 30:53.795
You're lucky she didn't sacrifice
the poor thing.

30:53.962 --> 30:55.255
I'm sorry?

30:57.508 --> 31:00.093
She's a strange kid.

31:00.260 --> 31:03.305
Very troubled.
Into all sorts of weird stuff.

31:03.472 --> 31:07.100
Black magic, voodoo,
God knows what else.

31:07.267 --> 31:09.603
No wonder she doesn't have
any friends.

31:09.770 --> 31:12.773
What makes you think
she's into black magic?

31:13.815 --> 31:15.817
You should see her room.

31:16.318 --> 31:21.698
It seems like every time I walk past,
she's in there chanting or something.

31:21.865 --> 31:25.160
Sometimes, I swear,
I even hear other voices.

31:26.203 --> 31:28.288
I know she's not happy there.

31:28.455 --> 31:32.959
I'm only taking care of her
until her mom gets out of rehab.

31:33.668 --> 31:38.048
Do you mind if I stop by your place
and pick up some things for Aviva?

31:38.215 --> 31:39.257
No.

31:40.050 --> 31:41.927
Great. Thanks.

31:42.093 --> 31:43.136
Feel better.

31:50.894 --> 31:52.562
Andy, I can't seem
to get ahold of Prue.

31:52.729 --> 31:54.230
I know she was going to the hospital.

31:54.397 --> 31:56.441
That's all right, Piper.
Thanks for trying.

31:56.608 --> 31:59.778
- I'm sure there's a perfectly good...
- Explanation.

31:59.944 --> 32:01.821
Wanna bet?

32:47.867 --> 32:50.745
"Kali says we're close to taking over
the Halliwell coven.

32:50.912 --> 32:53.247
I hate lying to them."

33:01.005 --> 33:03.090
<i>- Hello.
- Phoebe, it's me.</i>

33:03.257 --> 33:04.425
Prue, where are you?

33:04.592 --> 33:07.053
Piper called, said you were
supposed to meet Andy at Quake.

33:07.845 --> 33:10.014
Listen, we have a bigger problem
to deal with.

33:10.181 --> 33:12.558
<i>Call her back and tell her
to come home right away.</i>

33:12.725 --> 33:14.185
I'll explain it to you guys later.

33:14.351 --> 33:18.063
And Phoebe, whatever you do,
don't let Aviva out of your sight, okay?

33:18.355 --> 33:21.442
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Bye.

33:25.529 --> 33:26.614
Prue's on her way home.

33:26.780 --> 33:29.158
We can have our little chat
when she gets here.

33:29.325 --> 33:31.243
Yeah, okay.

33:32.536 --> 33:36.165
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and lie down? I'm not feeling real well.

33:36.457 --> 33:40.044
- Sure, go ahead.
- Okay.

34:10.197 --> 34:12.576
This last coat of stain's gotta dry.

34:12.868 --> 34:15.621
I'm headed over to Fillmore
in a few minutes to do an estimate.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.371
Wait, you're finished already?

34:17.539 --> 34:21.418
Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow to make
sure everybody's happy with my work.

34:26.922 --> 34:28.592
What?

34:29.885 --> 34:32.387
Just out of curiosity...

34:34.097 --> 34:35.891
...are you and Aviva...?

34:37.309 --> 34:40.437
- I mean, Piper said that...
- Piper said what?

34:43.565 --> 34:46.525
Nothing. I think I need some water.

34:58.246 --> 35:01.624
Wait. Leo, what did Piper
say to you?

35:01.791 --> 35:04.627
It doesn't matter really.
Forget it.

35:05.962 --> 35:09.966
Well, whatever she said, you should
probably take it with a grain of salt.

35:10.133 --> 35:14.679
Sometimes her medication
makes her say the strangest things.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.639
But not to worry,
her shrinks are on it.

35:16.806 --> 35:18.474
Shrinks?

35:32.405 --> 35:33.990
Oh, my God, Aviva.

35:35.658 --> 35:37.452
Prue's home.

35:37.618 --> 35:38.870
Oh, no.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.628
Aviva? Aviva?!

35:50.506 --> 35:52.800
What the hell are you doing?

35:55.636 --> 35:57.430
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

36:09.317 --> 36:11.319
Maybe we should take you
to the hospital.

36:11.485 --> 36:13.154
No, it's not that bad.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.406
Well, how did it happen anyway?

36:15.573 --> 36:20.995
Candles. Aviva had some candles lit,
and I guess the sweater got too close.

36:21.162 --> 36:25.207
- And then she ran out of the house.
- Sure caught fire fast.

36:25.499 --> 36:28.752
Leo, we got this. We wouldn't
want you to be late for that estimate.

36:29.086 --> 36:30.546
Are you sure? I don't mind.

36:30.713 --> 36:33.090
No, Prue's right. I'm fine.
You go ahead.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.301
Okay. I'll stop by later
to see how you're doing.

36:35.467 --> 36:37.219
- Great.
- Great.

36:40.723 --> 36:42.641
Okay, so how did this happen?

36:43.309 --> 36:47.604
I had a premonition
that Aviva was going to hurt you,

36:47.771 --> 36:51.608
so I tried to stop her.
I should've listened to you, Prue.

36:51.775 --> 36:54.111
You were right about Aviva.
She's evil.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.656
No, actually, she's not,
but she is being used by an evil spirit.

36:57.823 --> 37:01.243
And I think I know which one,
so come on.

37:11.753 --> 37:14.172
<i>- Where are you going, Aviva?
- Go away!</i>

37:14.339 --> 37:18.176
I don't want anything to do with you.
I don't wanna be a witch anymore.

37:18.343 --> 37:20.554
<i>But you haven't finished
what we started.</i>

37:20.721 --> 37:23.265
But I'm hurting people!
Don't you understand?

37:23.432 --> 37:27.602
First Aunt Jackie, now Phoebe.
I have to leave.

37:27.769 --> 37:30.188
<i>Aren't you going
to say goodbye first?</i>

37:31.189 --> 37:33.024
<i>Touch the mirror, Aviva.</i>

37:33.608 --> 37:36.862
<i>It's okay. I'm not upset.</i>

37:37.028 --> 37:40.532
<i>Touch the mirror,
and I'll go away too.</i>

37:53.461 --> 37:55.839
Hello, Aviva.

37:57.048 --> 37:59.509
Kali, Kali, Kali...

37:59.676 --> 38:00.885
There, there.

38:01.052 --> 38:03.346
"An evil sorceress cursed
into her own dimension,

38:03.513 --> 38:06.141
she appears in reflections and has
the power to possess..."

38:06.307 --> 38:08.768
"Innocents and uses them as pawns
to steal a witch's power."

38:08.935 --> 38:10.395
Wait, I don't understand.

38:10.562 --> 38:13.565
So she was using Aviva
to try and turn us into bad witches?

38:13.731 --> 38:15.733
Does it say anything
about how to get rid of her?

38:15.900 --> 38:17.944
Yeah, to get rid of her,
shatter her reflection.

38:18.111 --> 38:20.572
However the hell we do that. Here.

38:22.031 --> 38:24.409
- Aviva.
- Hello, Phoebe.

38:24.576 --> 38:27.203
- How's the arm?
- You're not Aviva.

38:27.495 --> 38:29.205
You're not kidding.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.920
- Phoebe, help me!
- Never mind.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.803
My powers are greater
than yours, Prue.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.722
It's only a matter of time.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.558
- Time. Piper, that's it. Freeze her.
- Aviva doesn't freeze.

38:48.724 --> 38:49.767
Yeah, but Kali will.

38:52.478 --> 38:53.980
No!

39:02.613 --> 39:05.241
Prue, the mirror.
Get her to the mirror.

39:08.494 --> 39:10.079
<i>No, no!</i>

39:21.841 --> 39:23.467
<i>No, no!</i>

39:29.849 --> 39:31.642
Thanks for the dress.

39:31.809 --> 39:33.978
No problem. It's Prue's.

39:34.937 --> 39:39.024
- All set?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

39:40.234 --> 39:42.027
You okay?

39:43.070 --> 39:47.199
I don't think looking into a mirror
is ever gonna be the same.

39:47.366 --> 39:50.703
Yeah, well, the demon's gone,
Aviva. Forever.

39:50.869 --> 39:54.790
Yeah, well, unfortunately
all the other ones remain.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.545
- It's so hard.
- Oh, I know.

40:00.170 --> 40:02.506
It was hard for me too
when I was your age.

40:03.590 --> 40:05.968
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?

40:06.135 --> 40:09.513
These are the hardest years
of your life.

40:09.680 --> 40:14.518
The one thing I learned
is you just gotta be yourself.

40:14.852 --> 40:17.980
It's easy for you to say.
What if yourself sucks?

40:18.480 --> 40:20.357
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

40:21.775 --> 40:25.112
No, Aviva, I'm serious.
You are a great kid.

40:25.279 --> 40:28.323
I could totally see us hanging out
together in school.

40:28.490 --> 40:31.076
A couple of troublemakers.

40:31.410 --> 40:35.247
I'm really gonna miss being a witch
and having powers

40:35.414 --> 40:38.667
- and having sisters.
- Yeah, well, you've got your mom.

40:38.834 --> 40:41.837
And your aunt will be home
from the hospital tomorrow.

40:43.213 --> 40:45.048
Okay, now remember,

40:45.215 --> 40:48.677
do not tell anyone
about us Halliwell sisters, all right?

40:48.844 --> 40:50.053
It's just our little secret.

40:50.220 --> 40:53.014
- I promise.
- Okay.

41:08.029 --> 41:10.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:11.408 --> 41:13.702
- Can we talk?
- Is there really anything to talk about?

41:13.868 --> 41:15.495
Andy.

41:16.413 --> 41:18.540
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

41:19.207 --> 41:20.416
What do you mean by that?

41:20.583 --> 41:22.836
Oh, come on, who are we
kidding? I mean, let's face it.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.797
One of us is more interested
in this relationship than the other.

41:25.964 --> 41:27.131
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

41:27.298 --> 41:29.759
How come I'm always the one
left standing there like a jerk?

41:29.926 --> 41:32.053
- I can explain.
- No, you can't.

41:32.637 --> 41:34.597
Or you won't.

41:39.269 --> 41:42.021
Damn it, Prue, I still love you.

41:42.188 --> 41:46.234
I'm not saying you have to explain it all
to me, Prue. That's your prerogative.

41:46.401 --> 41:48.528
All I'm saying is...

41:51.155 --> 41:53.116
...it hurts that you don't
trust me enough.

41:53.324 --> 41:54.784
I do trust you, Andy.

41:56.327 --> 41:59.539
It has nothing to do with you.
It's just...

42:01.666 --> 42:05.127
It's just something that I don't know
if I can ever share with anybody.

42:05.628 --> 42:08.381
Well, I hope that's not true
for your sake.

42:09.590 --> 42:12.635
All I know is there's nothing more
I can say or do to reassure you

42:12.927 --> 42:15.304
that I'm there for you.

42:19.934 --> 42:20.977
Andy.

42:24.772 --> 42:26.899
Are you saying that you don't
wanna see me anymore?

42:27.066 --> 42:29.735
I don't know what I want anymore.
