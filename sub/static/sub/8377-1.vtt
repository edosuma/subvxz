44:00.888 --> 44:02.556
Help!

44:02.932 --> 44:06.643
- Do you yield?
- I can't bloody swim!

44:08.771 --> 44:10.564
- Do you yield?
- Yes!

44:10.940 --> 44:14.359
Good. Now put your feet down.

44:19.407 --> 44:20.866
I'll be buggered.

44:22.243 --> 44:26.413
ROBIN: The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.665
Robin of Locksley.

44:29.083 --> 44:32.294
JOHN:
Well, Robin of Locksley...

44:32.462 --> 44:35.339
...you got balls of solid rock.
Come on.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.596
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell.

44:42.930 --> 44:48.018
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads all calls him Bull.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.979
- Because you're short?
- Nope.

44:51.439 --> 44:53.899
It's because I'm so long!

44:56.903 --> 45:01.615
- They ought to have a look.
- No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.618
Give the man some mead.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.623
Now, I made that myself.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.961
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

45:15.129 --> 45:17.798
...that a friend of mine's not welcome
at this table?

45:17.965 --> 45:20.342
But he's a savage, sire!

45:21.469 --> 45:23.303
That he is.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.432
But no more than you or I.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.853
And don't call me sire.

45:33.481 --> 45:37.192
With regret, I must decline.

45:38.319 --> 45:41.279
- Allah forbids it.
- Your bloody loss, mate.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.366
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

45:44.534 --> 45:48.328
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

45:48.496 --> 45:49.996
Even the young lad there.

45:50.164 --> 45:54.376
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

45:54.544 --> 45:58.755
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.883
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

46:08.141 --> 46:10.142
We can always fight back.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.602
[MEN LAUGHING]

46:13.104 --> 46:16.189
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.692
These are all good lads here.

46:18.860 --> 46:21.361
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.824
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

46:25.992 --> 46:28.743
MAN: They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

46:28.911 --> 46:31.246
- A witch?
WULF: She knows every man's thoughts.

46:31.414 --> 46:35.417
- You can see through her. And she flies.
- That's a load of codswallop.

46:35.585 --> 46:39.212
What does the rich son of a devil worshipper
care what happens to outlaw peasants?

46:39.380 --> 46:41.923
DUNCAN:
My lord was a kind and generous man!

46:42.091 --> 46:45.177
Who among you dares
believe him capable...?

46:45.344 --> 46:47.929
My father was no devil worshipper.

46:49.182 --> 46:52.309
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.022
But he's right.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.401
I was a rich man's son.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.573
But when I killed the sheriff's men...

47:07.742 --> 47:10.702
...I became an outlaw like you.
- You are nothing like us.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.957
JOHN:
That there's Will Scarlett.

47:16.125 --> 47:19.544
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.422
Come on, lads, drink up.

47:22.590 --> 47:25.175
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

47:25.343 --> 47:28.970
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

47:29.138 --> 47:31.306
Here we're safe.

47:31.933 --> 47:35.060
Here we are kings.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.296
- Too much mead, old friend?
- Forgive me, I oversleep.

48:03.464 --> 48:06.174
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

48:15.309 --> 48:19.187
- What day is it, Duncan?
- Sunday, I think.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.233
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

48:23.401 --> 48:24.776
That they do.

48:24.944 --> 48:28.947
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

48:44.547 --> 48:47.132
Well, my other god calls.

48:48.259 --> 48:51.261
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

48:51.429 --> 48:55.348
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

48:55.516 --> 48:59.936
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

49:01.731 --> 49:03.690
Although...

49:03.858 --> 49:06.943
...frankly, sometimes...

49:08.529 --> 49:11.031
...I can't see much difference.

49:13.701 --> 49:18.496
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

49:19.457 --> 49:21.791
Their dying wish.

50:01.791 --> 50:04.751
MAN:
We beseech thy blessing, Lord...

50:04.919 --> 50:09.756
...on all your people,
but most especially...

50:09.924 --> 50:13.259
...on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

50:13.928 --> 50:17.597
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

50:17.765 --> 50:20.266
...our glorious city.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.769
Grant him also the strength...

50:22.937 --> 50:26.606
...to bring to justice
the lawless men...

50:26.774 --> 50:31.152
...who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

50:31.320 --> 50:34.030
And the judgment
to punish them...

50:34.198 --> 50:37.492
...in your name. Amen.

50:38.411 --> 50:40.245
MEN:
Amen.

50:40.413 --> 50:42.205
PRIEST:
Go in peace.

50:50.798 --> 50:52.424
- Sarah?
- Yes.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.596
- That's all I have.
WOMAN: God bless you, ma'am.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.534
ROBIN:
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

51:20.327 --> 51:23.246
For one who cannot see your beauty?

51:26.333 --> 51:29.544
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

51:29.712 --> 51:32.172
Searching my soul.

51:32.506 --> 51:35.508
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.178
ROBIN:
Do you prefer the company of Nottingham?

51:38.345 --> 51:40.054
There's a price on your head.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.724
- How much?
- One hundred gold pieces.

51:42.892 --> 51:44.684
Is that all?

51:44.852 --> 51:48.730
I shall have to annoy the good sheriff more.
Soon it will be 1000.

51:48.898 --> 51:51.483
For 1000, I would turn you in myself.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.027
Nottingham is mounting an army.

51:54.278 --> 51:58.531
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and armor.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.950
- What is he planning?
- I don't know.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.995
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.750
- Go. Quickly, go!
- Thank you.

52:09.877 --> 52:11.336
Robin, do something for me.

52:11.504 --> 52:13.713
- What?
- Take a bath.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.882
Take a bath?

52:34.902 --> 52:38.279
These are my private chambers, my son.

52:39.073 --> 52:42.158
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.202
- Ah!
- Shh.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.836
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

52:54.255 --> 52:56.422
Welcome home, Robin.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.135
You shine like the sun, my lady.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.097
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

53:04.265 --> 53:08.393
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

53:08.561 --> 53:11.521
- Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
- Yes, I know.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.690
And for inflicting that upon you...

53:13.858 --> 53:16.734
...l'm going to hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

53:16.902 --> 53:17.944
I'd like to see that.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.697
If you'd bring your household
within the city...

53:20.865 --> 53:23.199
...I could give your needs
personal attention.

53:23.367 --> 53:27.871
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

53:29.623 --> 53:31.916
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

53:32.084 --> 53:36.796
...of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

53:40.009 --> 53:44.804
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.681
Yes. Um...

53:46.849 --> 53:50.393
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.645
I fear for his safe return.

53:52.813 --> 53:55.607
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

53:55.774 --> 54:00.361
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

54:04.408 --> 54:09.495
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one...

54:09.663 --> 54:14.125
...because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

54:14.877 --> 54:16.669
He said...

54:16.837 --> 54:22.091
...he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.728
You lie.

54:40.027 --> 54:43.279
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

54:51.121 --> 54:54.415
NOTTINGHAM:
You bastard! In there!

54:54.667 --> 54:55.959
Get him!

55:01.674 --> 55:03.383
Locksley!

55:03.550 --> 55:07.387
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

55:08.055 --> 55:09.973
Then it begins.

55:25.531 --> 55:29.826
WOMAN: He's taking the sheriff's horse!
MAN 1: He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

55:32.079 --> 55:33.955
Close that gate!

55:34.623 --> 55:39.043
MAN 2: The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

55:56.979 --> 55:59.397
NOTTINGHAM:
What are you looking at?!

56:19.626 --> 56:21.002
Water!

56:21.170 --> 56:23.838
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

56:24.006 --> 56:27.925
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

56:28.093 --> 56:31.387
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know...

56:31.555 --> 56:33.347
...great one.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.433
I prefer to have the choice.

56:35.601 --> 56:37.852
WILL: Wonderful! You've stolen
the sheriff's horse?

56:38.020 --> 56:40.980
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

56:41.148 --> 56:43.816
- Are you afraid, John?
- Yeah, a little.

56:43.984 --> 56:48.321
So is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

56:48.489 --> 56:52.533
- You fool! You've started a war!
ROBIN: We're already at war.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.996
Bread.

56:58.499 --> 57:01.667
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

57:01.835 --> 57:04.212
...and would hunt our children.
- We?

57:05.005 --> 57:07.673
You planning to join us then, matey?

57:08.717 --> 57:10.676
No, to lead you.

57:15.015 --> 57:16.599
Christian.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.851
These are simple people.

57:19.019 --> 57:21.145
They are not warriors.

57:21.313 --> 57:24.357
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

57:24.525 --> 57:28.861
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

57:31.406 --> 57:34.534
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an ax?

57:34.701 --> 57:38.996
NOTTINGHAM: Because it's dull, you twit!
Lt'll hurt more!

57:39.164 --> 57:42.542
I want this brigand found.

57:42.709 --> 57:44.293
Starve them out!

57:44.461 --> 57:47.380
Slaughter their...
No, take their livestock.

57:47.548 --> 57:50.800
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

57:50.968 --> 57:54.053
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

57:54.221 --> 57:57.014
Something to drive fear into the hearts
of the populace.

57:57.182 --> 58:00.393
- "Locksley the Lethal" or "Wreaking Robin."
- Whatever.

58:00.561 --> 58:04.397
I want him dead by the next full moon,
before the barons come back.

58:04.565 --> 58:06.691
Now sew!

58:08.068 --> 58:11.445
And keep the stitches small.

58:17.286 --> 58:18.995
[YELLS]

58:30.048 --> 58:32.175
He's not here, sir.

58:33.051 --> 58:35.595
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

58:35.762 --> 58:39.599
- He died last winter.
- Burn it down!

58:46.231 --> 58:49.358
Leave us the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

58:49.526 --> 58:53.446
- You heard of the Sherwood bandit?
- Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.

58:53.614 --> 58:56.782
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.749
Over here!

59:07.628 --> 59:10.588
MAN:
Alfred! What's happened to you?

59:15.260 --> 59:18.137
- Oh, John!
JOHN: Fanny!

59:18.305 --> 59:21.349
- Will, they burned it, all of it.
WILL: Are you all right?

59:22.851 --> 59:24.852
Where is this Robin Hood?

59:25.354 --> 59:26.729
He's there.

59:28.106 --> 59:31.234
Look! Look what they've done!

59:35.072 --> 59:37.823
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

59:37.991 --> 59:40.868
...I think you have it.

59:42.871 --> 59:45.665
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

59:45.832 --> 59:50.044
ROBIN: It's Nottingham trying to divide us.
- We are divided, rich boy.

59:50.212 --> 59:52.255
I'm not blind as that old man
over there.

59:52.422 --> 59:55.508
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.

59:55.676 --> 01:00:00.972
I heard today that the sheriff
now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:04.600
I say we take him in.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:10.856
Will, do you think the sheriff will give
everything back after I'm gone?

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:14.318
- He'll give us the reward and our pardons.
ROBIN: Wrong!

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.323
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.742
What would you have us do?

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:26.247
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and our bare hands?

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:28.291
If needs be.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:32.753
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you, Will.

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:35.214
Courage.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.640
Look out!

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.073
Thank you, Wulf.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.118
- You wish to end this?
MEN: Yeah.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.162
- You wish to go home?
MEN: Aye.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.082
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.127
...and face that the price for it
may be dear.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:15.588
I, for one, would rather die...

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:18.215
...than spend my life in hiding.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:20.760
The sheriff calls us outlaws.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.637
But I say we are free.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.390
And one free man defending his home...

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:30.144
...is more powerful than 10 hired soldiers.

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.774
The Crusades taught me that.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:40.404
I will make you no promises save one.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:46.160
That if you truly believe
in your hearts that you are free...

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:49.038
...then I say we can win.

- The king is not here to be challenged.

We have a rule here, you know.

Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

There's too many lives at stake.

That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

...Allah loves wondrous variety.

How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:57.031
...has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:01.452
I've seen knights in armor panic
at the first hint of battle.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:06.582
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body...

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.584
...to defend a dying horse.

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.630
Nobility's not a birthright.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.758
It's defined by one's actions.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.888
It's interesting to hear you say that.

Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.609
I don't know.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:40.742
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:44.036
I was lost after my mother died.

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:48.166
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:51.836
...in the arms of another woman.
A peasant woman.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.758
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

01:24:57.176 --> 01:24:59.010
So he gave her up?

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:04.807
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.440
Anyway, who...?

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.067

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:33.920
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

'tis a burden to them.

02:24:06.138 --> 02:24:08.139
I'll do the only taking today.

02:24:20.152 --> 02:24:23.321
You sold your soul to Satan, your grace.

02:24:24.781 --> 02:24:29.618
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

02:24:29.786 --> 02:24:35.541
Brother friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

02:24:35.709 --> 02:24:38.711
No. No, I wouldn't.

02:24:38.879 --> 02:24:42.214
In fact, I'll help you pack
for your journey.

02:24:42.382 --> 02:24:45.593
You're going to need lots of gold
to help you on your way.

02:24:45.761 --> 02:24:49.430
You're a very rich man.
This too.

02:24:49.598 --> 02:24:51.390
Enough!

02:24:51.558 --> 02:24:54.101
Here's 30 pieces of silver...

02:24:54.269 --> 02:24:57.271
...to pay the devil on your way to hell!

02:25:50.992 --> 02:25:52.660
Robin!

02:26:05.632 --> 02:26:07.716
Get ready.

I have fulfilled my vow, sadiq.

02:27:58.328 --> 02:28:00.538
You came for me.

02:28:01.456 --> 02:28:03.707
You're alive.

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:06.293
I would die for you.

02:28:14.219 --> 02:28:18.013
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church...

02:28:18.181 --> 02:28:22.893
...I say any man who has reason
why these two should not be joined...

02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:25.271
...let him speak now...

02:28:25.438 --> 02:28:28.065
...or forever hold his peace.

02:28:31.570 --> 02:28:34.154
- Then I now pronounce you...
MAN 1: Hold!

02:28:34.322 --> 02:28:35.990
I speak.

02:28:45.625 --> 02:28:48.794
- Richard!
MAN 2: It's the king.

02:28:57.721 --> 02:29:00.472
- I will not allow this wedding to proceed.
- My lord...

02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.349
Unless...

02:29:02.934 --> 02:29:05.185
...l'm allowed to give the bride away.

02:29:05.353 --> 02:29:07.771
You look radiant, cousin.

02:29:10.650 --> 02:29:12.985
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

02:29:13.153 --> 02:29:16.488
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

02:29:16.656 --> 02:29:19.366
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

02:29:19.826 --> 02:29:21.660
Friar, proceed.

02:29:29.169 --> 02:29:32.004
Husband and wife.

02:29:33.173 --> 02:29:34.715
You may kiss the bride.

02:29:34.883 --> 02:29:36.634
I know that.

02:30:02.243 --> 02:30:03.994
Now, get out of it.

02:30:04.162 --> 02:30:06.914
