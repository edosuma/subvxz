WEBVTT

01:23.751 --> 01:25.462
Run! Run!

01:27.088 --> 01:28.089
Run!

01:40.351 --> 01:41.394
Faster!

02:49.629 --> 02:51.422
Steady the lines
to the bow!

02:51.506 --> 02:52.882
Cross the sails!

02:56.761 --> 02:58.012
We're almost there!

03:00.557 --> 03:02.559
That's it!
A little closer!

03:09.941 --> 03:10.942
Ivar.

03:30.545 --> 03:33.214
Ivar and Hvitserk Lothbrok.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.259
Why did you not
return to Kattegat?

03:37.135 --> 03:41.264
You don't need the seer
to know that Ubbe
and I fell out.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.350
We disagreed
about many things.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.853
But, in the end,

03:47.520 --> 03:51.482
Hvitserk agreed with me,
and Ubbe sailed alone
to Kattegat.

03:51.566 --> 03:52.567
And

03:52.817 --> 03:53.985
that is why we're here.

03:54.611 --> 03:56.571
A good choice,
a good choice.

04:01.451 --> 04:03.411
Surely you both
remember Astrid?

04:04.120 --> 04:05.246
She is my Queen now.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.126
I am happy for both of you.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.754
Oh, thank you, Ivar.

04:17.467 --> 04:20.219
So, do I understand
that you and your warriors

04:20.303 --> 04:22.472
will support me
when I attack Kattegat?

04:22.889 --> 04:24.098
Straight to it. I like it.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.516
Yes, we will.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.268
But only if Ivar
is made King.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.819
You know that I have
my own plans for that kingdom.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.863
Of course, of course.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.740
And that is why we are here.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.826
What I think my dear brother
is trying to say is that,

04:44.869 --> 04:45.870
in the long term,

04:45.953 --> 04:49.916
what is to stop you
from ruling Kattegat
when I am dead and gone?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.460
How long can that be?

04:53.002 --> 04:54.462
I'm not a healthy person.

04:55.505 --> 04:56.506
I'm a cripple.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.800
But your brother Hvitserk?

04:59.133 --> 05:03.304
All that matters
to the both of us
is to reclaim the kingdom

05:03.388 --> 05:07.392
that was torn from us
by that murderess bitch,
Lagertha.

05:08.101 --> 05:09.852
We want to be
in an alliance with you,

05:10.520 --> 05:12.063
to make that happen.

05:13.106 --> 05:14.107
And soon.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.027
You have a prisoner.

05:19.195 --> 05:20.279
I have heard of this man.

05:20.613 --> 05:21.614
Where is he?

05:23.449 --> 05:24.534
Bring the Christian!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.088
On his knees.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.510
Bishop Heahmund.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.153
What is the point of him?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.029
Why don't you just kill him?

06:03.030 --> 06:06.576
Because he is
a great warrior.

06:06.993 --> 06:09.120
I have seen how he fights
with my own eyes.

06:09.954 --> 06:13.291
And I admire
great warriors.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.543
He will fight for us?

06:17.253 --> 06:18.254
Maybe.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.048
If he doesn't want
to get crucified.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.521
No, no, no.

06:36.689 --> 06:37.774
Let him continue.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.269
What did he say?
He is praying to his god.

07:16.062 --> 07:18.105
A fat lot of good
that will do him.

07:38.835 --> 07:39.836
Father,

07:41.337 --> 07:42.755
we can't stay here.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.382
The Northmen will come.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.342
And where should we go?

07:46.884 --> 07:48.386
Back to the swamps,
of course.

07:50.263 --> 07:51.264
We'll be safe there.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.767
I don't want
to run anymore.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.270
But we've...
No.

07:57.728 --> 07:58.729
No, your father
is right.

07:58.813 --> 08:00.147
We cannot run
and hide.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.691
And we won't.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.401
Why not?

08:04.068 --> 08:05.695
Because Father is King.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.118
In line!

08:14.120 --> 08:17.498
- We need more water!
- Fetch it while you can!

08:20.543 --> 08:22.837
You men! Head down
the right flank!

08:26.674 --> 08:27.675
Grandfather...

08:28.926 --> 08:31.470
I don't want
to disturb your sleep,
but I need to talk to you.

08:34.348 --> 08:39.395
We have suffered
a most grievous defeat

08:40.187 --> 08:42.607
at the hands of the Northmen
and the sons of Ragnar.

08:46.068 --> 08:49.739
No words can explain
the misery and desolation
of our people.

08:51.157 --> 08:54.118
For now, it seems
we are at their mercy.

09:04.754 --> 09:07.715
Everything you dreamed of
and worked for,

09:08.591 --> 09:11.510
this great kingdom
you carved out of England,

09:12.094 --> 09:13.095
could be lost.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.355
But I want to make you
this promise.

09:23.981 --> 09:28.819
If our Lord
should ever see fit
to choose me as King,

09:29.153 --> 09:30.947
even over this wasteland,

09:31.113 --> 09:34.492
then I swear to you,
as if you were sitting
next to me now,

09:34.575 --> 09:36.077
that I will fight and struggle

09:36.160 --> 09:38.579
to restore your kingdom
to its former glories.

09:39.205 --> 09:42.667
To realize your dream
of becoming King
of all England...

09:44.627 --> 09:46.504
Or perish in the trying.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.016
That's a fine sword.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.437
It is the bishop's sword.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.149
He must have paid the dwarves
a great deal to make it,

10:48.399 --> 10:50.151
because it is a magical sword.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.611
The metal is much stronger
than ours.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.781
I saw him kill
many men with it.

10:56.157 --> 10:57.825
And the edge never blunted,

10:58.576 --> 11:00.035
but continued to bite.

11:01.787 --> 11:02.788
And now...

11:04.582 --> 11:05.750
It is mine.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.169
To have such a sword

11:08.919 --> 11:10.296
gives you a great advantage.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.091
Think of Odin's spear.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.804
And now think
of Ivar's sword.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.480
What is it you really want,
Ivar Lothbrok?

11:29.190 --> 11:30.191
Hmm?

11:31.692 --> 11:32.693
Revenge.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.907
I dream of the many ways

11:37.990 --> 11:40.493
that I can make Lagertha
suffer before I kill her.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.247
I want revenge because...

11:47.291 --> 11:49.126
Because she killed
my beautiful mother.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.838
What of the kingdom?

11:53.214 --> 11:54.215
What of Kattegat?

11:54.298 --> 11:55.591
It is not
so important to me.

11:56.675 --> 11:57.927
But surely
your brother will...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.887
I said it is not
so important to me.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.889
What is it
about the word "King"

12:01.972 --> 12:05.100
that makes
even reasonable people
behave like idiots, huh?

12:13.526 --> 12:14.693
Ah!

12:15.653 --> 12:16.946
How is married life?

12:19.323 --> 12:22.326
You are married to Astrid,
Lagertha's lover.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.329
I hope she's worth it.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.117
I warned you.

13:04.118 --> 13:05.119
Who was it?

13:07.913 --> 13:09.039
Who gave us away?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.041
Who betrayed us?

13:15.421 --> 13:16.505
You, Guthrum.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.058
Why?

13:28.267 --> 13:29.768
I thought hard
about what you said.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.188
That in this place
there would be no war.

13:34.023 --> 13:36.317
But then I remembered
my father in Valhalla,

13:37.109 --> 13:39.737
and I realized that
if I did not die well
in battle

13:41.488 --> 13:42.865
that I would never
see him again.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.495
I don't want to be
imprisoned again,
Lagertha.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.791
Spare me that, at least.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.170
A swift blow
with ax or sword
is all I ask.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.257
You deserve to be punished.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.346
I have done nothing
to justify your betrayal.

14:09.475 --> 14:10.476
Eyvind.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.271
And you,
Ketill Flatnose.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.149
Why were you going
to leave us?

14:18.108 --> 14:21.820
Both of you
are renowned warriors
from prominent families.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.364
Kattegat is your home.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.115
Floki persuaded us.

14:25.491 --> 14:28.369
Who, if he was honest,
would not want to live
among the gods?

14:28.452 --> 14:31.246
Kattegat is in danger,
and you thought
only of yourself.

14:32.498 --> 14:33.499
And you...

14:33.999 --> 14:35.000
Aud.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.419
I have always been
true to you, Lagertha.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.506
But you know yourself,
we are the gods' playthings.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.384
I realized that
it wasn't Floki
the boatbuilder

14:43.467 --> 14:44.843
who was calling me away,

14:45.427 --> 14:47.179
but the god
who inhabits him.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.224
Therefore, I had
to accept my fate.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.642
And I still have to.

14:52.101 --> 14:53.143
Whatever it is.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.235
I have been betrayed
very often in my life,

15:01.318 --> 15:02.778
but I've never got used to it.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.867
But I will allow you to go.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.711
I will allow
all of you to go.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.006
What point is served
by keeping you all here
against your will?

15:23.757 --> 15:27.136
Especially if Aud is right,
and your leaving is the will
of the gods.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.391
I only hope Floki has found
what he says he has found.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.437
I have known him a long time.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.105
He is a good man

15:38.939 --> 15:40.441
and a great shipbuilder.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.318
But he is also the trickster.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.696
No, Lagertha.

15:46.822 --> 15:47.823
Not now.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.199
Not this time.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.956
Did you really think
I could have you killed,
Floki?

15:59.543 --> 16:01.920
You've done worse things
than that, Lagertha.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.263
Shield-maiden,
blessed by the gods.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.891
Farewell.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.701
You see how weak she is?

16:33.202 --> 16:35.621
She makes it look like
she's controlling everything,

16:35.996 --> 16:39.041
but of course
she has no real power,
she just proved it.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.429
I cannot believe
she spared us.

16:52.805 --> 16:54.348
She is truly
a great woman.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.476
She spared us
because she is a woman.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.187
No man in her position
would have done so.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.189
Are you sure?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.107
Yes.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.776
Men are impatient.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.861
They cannot wait
for anything.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.615
If they have power,
they need to exercise it.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.451
Otherwise, it seems to them
that they have no power.

17:15.244 --> 17:17.996
But a woman must wait
almost a year to give birth.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.459
Therefore, she lives life
more slowly, and more deeply.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.504
But what is it
she is waiting for?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.343
She is waiting to see
if Floki is right.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.231
There is going to be a war.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.610
A war that will make me
the King of Kattegat,

17:49.111 --> 17:50.445
my father's kingdom.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.534
A war against the usurper,

17:55.951 --> 17:58.328
Ragnar's first wife, Lagertha,

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
who killed my mother
in order to be Queen.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.085
And, of course,

18:06.169 --> 18:08.380
a war between brothers.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.509
Bishop, you have a choice.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.013
Fight alongside me,

18:17.097 --> 18:18.557
or I will kill you.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.060
What are your wars to me?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.021
A way of staying alive.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.815
I'm not afraid to die
for my faith.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.526
But you are not being asked
to do that.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.613
I'm not asking you
to renounce your faith

18:33.405 --> 18:36.241
or to fight
against Christians.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.621
All I'm asking you
is to kill more of those
you call heathens.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.713
Why do you offer me
this choice?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.593
Because I am jealous of you.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.722
I would like to be like you.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.058
Strong

19:03.560 --> 19:04.645
and whole.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.814
A great warrior.

19:10.943 --> 19:12.486
That is why I saved you.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.451
And that is why I want you
to fight alongside me.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.668
Turn the sails!

19:28.710 --> 19:29.920
All together!

19:31.922 --> 19:33.298
They're backing!

19:33.632 --> 19:35.717
The wind... Come around!

19:36.927 --> 19:38.929
Row closer!

19:41.473 --> 19:42.641
I see land!

19:54.778 --> 19:56.238
Ketill!

19:56.989 --> 19:58.448
Eyvind!

20:02.619 --> 20:03.829
Look over there.

20:18.593 --> 20:19.928
Do not worry, Aud.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.223
It cannot be
as bad as it looks.

20:47.664 --> 20:48.665
Will he fight with us?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.459
I have really no idea.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.380
You didn't discuss with me
the arrangement you made
with King Harald.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.215
What arrangement?

20:57.299 --> 20:58.759
That you would be King,

20:59.634 --> 21:02.220
but that afterwards,
the crown would pass down
to him first,

21:02.304 --> 21:03.597
and not to me.

21:04.598 --> 21:07.934
That is because, Hvitserk,
it is not really
an arrangement.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.312
It is just words.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.064
Hmm?

21:19.571 --> 21:20.864
Who is to say

21:21.782 --> 21:23.158
that he will not try
to kill me?

21:24.159 --> 21:26.078
Or that I might try
to kill him?

21:26.828 --> 21:29.706
Or that you might try
to kill the both of us,
for that matter?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.626
Then why even pretend
there is an arrangement?

21:35.253 --> 21:36.421
It suits everyone.

21:37.631 --> 21:38.757
For the moment.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.347
But then again,
everything can also change
in a moment, right?

21:47.140 --> 21:48.475
I don't know, Ivar.

21:49.601 --> 21:50.894
I wish I could believe you.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.480
I wish I knew
who you really were.

21:55.107 --> 21:58.568
Ah, you know
who I really am,
Hvitserk.

21:58.652 --> 21:59.820
I'm your crippled brother.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.241
You used to pull me on
a sledge through the streets
of Kattegat, remember?

22:04.741 --> 22:08.453
Nothing has really changed
except those were
only childish games.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.955
What is it
you really want, Ivar?

22:11.790 --> 22:14.209
I want to be
the most famous man
who ever lived.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.503
Even greater than Father?

22:18.505 --> 22:19.798
Much greater than Father.

22:21.133 --> 22:24.845
In time, the name
of Ragnar Lothbrok will fade
and be forgotten.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.598
No one will ever forget
Ivar the Boneless.

22:41.820 --> 22:45.991
Lord, deliver me
in Thy righteousness,

22:46.616 --> 22:48.451
and cause me to escape.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.206
Incline Thine ear unto me,
and save me.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.210
Deliver me, O Lord,

22:58.295 --> 22:59.796
out of the hands
of the wicked,

23:01.464 --> 23:03.717
out of the hands
of the unrighteous

23:04.718 --> 23:05.969
and cruel man.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.016
For Thou art...

23:12.559 --> 23:13.727
For Thou art...

23:16.062 --> 23:19.232
For Thou art my hope, O Lord.

23:35.749 --> 23:39.044
To the overthrow
of the witch, Lagertha,

23:39.502 --> 23:41.671
and to the liberation
of Kattegat!

23:43.465 --> 23:44.549
Skol.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.931
So, when do we attack?

23:53.391 --> 23:54.976
I will summon my jarls.

23:56.436 --> 24:00.106
And my ships still need
to be repaired and made ready,
as do yours.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.150
But when all this is done,

24:02.692 --> 24:05.070
we should have a fleet
of at least 70 ships.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.615
There is a full moon tonight.

24:09.532 --> 24:13.245
Let us say that we will attack
in two moons' time.

24:13.703 --> 24:14.704
I agree.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.665
Skol.
Skol.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.717
It will be strange
for you to return to Kattegat

24:28.426 --> 24:29.511
as a Queen.

24:32.847 --> 24:33.890
Skol.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.731
And here is to
our sacred agreement.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.609
Which if any man breaks,

24:46.236 --> 24:48.196
he will deserve to die.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.080
- Skol.
- Skol.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.874
<i>My mother told me</i>

25:00.333 --> 25:02.585
<i>Someday I would buy</i>

25:02.919 --> 25:05.380
<i>Galley with good oars</i>

25:05.630 --> 25:07.507
<i>Sail to distant shores!</i>

25:18.018 --> 25:19.185
Amen.

25:19.811 --> 25:20.895
Amen.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.209
Amen.

25:57.724 --> 25:58.850
Amen.

26:16.785 --> 26:17.827
Alfred!

26:18.328 --> 26:19.537
Help him.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.122
- Alfred?
- Alfred!

26:21.331 --> 26:22.665
Help him.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.501
Son.
Alfred?

26:24.918 --> 26:25.919
Help him.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.254
Take him to his chamber.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.219
One, two, three.

26:45.939 --> 26:48.900
It's as if
the slaughter of our army
was God's punishment

26:48.983 --> 26:52.153
for the sins and evils
of our people.

26:56.366 --> 26:59.285
Naked came I
out of my mother's womb,

27:00.286 --> 27:01.371
and naked

27:02.038 --> 27:03.164
shall I return.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.209
The Lord gives

27:06.376 --> 27:08.503
and the Lord takes away.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.297
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.550
I don't believe you.

27:14.050 --> 27:18.429
I don't believe
that we are being punished.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.476
After all, God is merciful.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.186
Is he not?

27:26.646 --> 27:29.607
He loves us like a father.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.780
If you have lost hope
that Alfred will survive,

27:35.864 --> 27:37.365
then you need
to leave me alone.

27:38.616 --> 27:42.495
You leave me alone
to pray for his soul.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.414
All of you!

28:00.847 --> 28:02.348
What is your name?

28:03.558 --> 28:04.684
Hakon.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.061
You're going whaling?

28:09.063 --> 28:10.190
Leave tomorrow.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.027
Who's your captain?

28:17.530 --> 28:18.698
You're looking at him.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.325
How long will you be away for?

28:21.034 --> 28:22.035
Depends.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.495
Ten days, maybe.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.209
Do you sail close
to Kattegat?

28:30.460 --> 28:31.461
No.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.921
Not often.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.672
How long would it take you
to sail there?

28:35.465 --> 28:37.342
If I had any reason
to sail there,

28:38.051 --> 28:39.427
only two days.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.013
How loyal is your crew?

28:45.558 --> 28:47.227
They are all members
of my family.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.688
Is that
a good enough answer?

28:53.816 --> 28:54.859
Queen Astrid,

28:55.610 --> 28:57.362
why are you asking me
these questions?

29:16.089 --> 29:19.509
I want you
to deliver a message
to someone in Kattegat.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.178
A message?
Yes.

29:22.345 --> 29:23.680
What kind of message?

29:24.722 --> 29:25.723
Just...

29:25.807 --> 29:28.101
Just tell me that you might
consider my request.

29:30.395 --> 29:33.022
I take it that this
is dangerous?

29:33.731 --> 29:34.732
Yes.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.651
Well,

29:37.068 --> 29:39.946
if it's dangerous,
can you make it
worth my while?

29:40.905 --> 29:41.990
Yes.

29:46.703 --> 29:47.704
Look.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.541
That is generous.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.045
But...

29:57.755 --> 29:58.756
There is more.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.466
Much more.

30:01.092 --> 30:04.929
Enough for you and your crew
never to go whaling again,
if you choose.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.436
I agree.
And you won't betray me?

30:12.979 --> 30:13.980
No.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.773
Good.

30:16.941 --> 30:17.942
I will return.

30:20.611 --> 30:21.612
Wait.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.741
There is something else
I want.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.077
What?

30:32.707 --> 30:33.708
You.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.626
I want you.

30:38.129 --> 30:41.799
For what man doesn't want
to have sex with the Queen?

31:36.104 --> 31:37.146
Floki!

31:37.730 --> 31:39.857
Where is this good land
you promised us?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.609
Here is only rock.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.778
We can't plant
anything here.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.365
No doubt Floki has found
a better place than here.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.826
It is the same
in our country,
is it not?

31:49.909 --> 31:51.494
Lots of barren places.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.539
But this was supposed
to be different.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.083
That's what Floki told us.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.877
A land of milk and honey.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.256
How much further
do we have to walk?

32:05.133 --> 32:06.551
Just a few more days.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.263
We have to keep walking.
We will get there.

32:19.814 --> 32:20.815
Floki,

32:21.649 --> 32:22.692
why go inland?

32:23.151 --> 32:24.819
Why didn't we settle
on the coast?

32:31.617 --> 32:32.618
In the beginning,

32:33.870 --> 32:35.872
this will be very hard work.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.586
So hard that you will
curse this land

32:43.087 --> 32:45.381
and you will curse the man
who brought you here.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.134
But in the end,

32:50.344 --> 32:51.429
I swear,

32:52.889 --> 32:55.224
you will thank him
for bringing you here,

32:56.434 --> 32:57.810
to the land of the gods.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.103
Do you have the treasure?

34:48.838 --> 34:50.047
What is the message?

34:50.715 --> 34:54.760
Tell Queen Lagertha
that the attack will come
in two moons' time.

34:57.513 --> 34:58.514
Is that all?

34:58.973 --> 34:59.974
Yes.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.810
But you have to swear
on the gods to deliver it.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.522
I'll swear
on whoever you like.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.066
I'll deliver it.

35:15.656 --> 35:16.657
Now,

35:17.366 --> 35:18.534
the sex.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.203
Do you have to?

35:21.829 --> 35:22.997
What do you mean?

35:26.042 --> 35:28.753
An agreement is an agreement.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.805
What are you doing?

36:24.225 --> 36:25.393
Who are these men?

36:30.106 --> 36:31.107
My crew.

36:36.153 --> 36:42.410
I told you, what man
doesn't want to have sex
with the Queen?

36:44.370 --> 36:45.371
No.

36:47.415 --> 36:48.416
No!

37:10.813 --> 37:12.189
Ah!

37:20.072 --> 37:21.407
If you don't submit,

37:21.490 --> 37:23.576
I'll tell King Harald
how you plan to betray him.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.633
Alfred.

37:42.344 --> 37:43.596
What are you doing?

37:43.679 --> 37:44.847
Leaving.

37:45.139 --> 37:48.642
I have decided to go on
a pilgrimage to the monastery
at Lindisfarne.

37:49.852 --> 37:53.439
That's where your father
was trained for the church.

37:57.735 --> 37:59.987
Are you certain
you're well enough
to travel?

38:00.571 --> 38:02.114
Yes.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.079
So, why do you want to go?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.832
It might help me
to understand things.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.793
Surely...

38:15.753 --> 38:17.463
Don't do
what you always do.

38:18.047 --> 38:20.049
Don't pretend
that it was just something
that happened.

38:21.634 --> 38:23.177
It didn't just happen.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.638
You had sex.
You got pregnant.
I was the result.

38:25.721 --> 38:29.350
But now, it's as though
we can all agree
that it never really happened.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.062
But I need to follow
in my father's footsteps.

38:34.939 --> 38:37.816
I need to find out
who he really was
and where he came from.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.320
Surely you wouldn't deny me
that journey?

38:42.071 --> 38:43.280
No.

38:43.781 --> 38:45.407
No, of course not.

38:59.505 --> 39:00.714
Son.

39:02.132 --> 39:05.636
Use your shield,
or lose your head.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.179
Again.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.401
Enough.

39:20.818 --> 39:22.361
Good.

39:22.611 --> 39:23.862
Good.

39:23.946 --> 39:25.656
Well fought, my Lord.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.242
You have the makings
of a great warrior.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.745
And a great King.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.474
In two full moons?

39:52.891 --> 39:53.892
Did she say any more?

39:54.393 --> 39:56.312
How many ships
they may have?
How many warriors?

39:56.478 --> 39:57.479
No.

39:59.023 --> 40:00.649
But I can tell you something.

40:01.609 --> 40:04.862
Ivar, the Boneless
has joined with King Harald.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.363
Ivar?

40:06.530 --> 40:08.157
He appeared one day
with his ships.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.326
He and Harald
have feasted together.

40:18.876 --> 40:20.002
And, tell me...

40:21.211 --> 40:22.630
How is Queen Astrid?

40:24.214 --> 40:25.424
She is well enough.

40:26.175 --> 40:27.676
I did not see her
very long.

40:28.385 --> 40:31.055
After all, what am I
but a simple fisherman?

40:31.889 --> 40:35.142
I think now
she must regard you
as a friend and ally.

40:36.352 --> 40:40.064
Perhaps.
I have enjoyed serving her.

40:43.525 --> 40:46.070
See that this man
and his crew
are well cared for.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.411
We don't have much time.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.665
We must decide what to do,

40:58.374 --> 41:00.209
whether to wait here
for the attack,

41:01.001 --> 41:03.045
or choose another place
to do battle.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.631
Ubbe,

41:07.174 --> 41:08.842
you will lead our army.

41:09.635 --> 41:10.636
Yes.

41:11.345 --> 41:12.805
Against my two brothers.

41:14.473 --> 41:15.933
Who could ever imagine
such a thing?

41:17.226 --> 41:19.812
This is going to rip
my father's legacy apart.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.398
More even than that, Ubbe.

41:22.856 --> 41:26.443
As the Seer foretold,
it will tear our world apart.

41:29.196 --> 41:30.656
Now we must all
prepare for it.

41:31.365 --> 41:32.533
The days will pass
like the wind.

41:34.118 --> 41:35.828
I will see
to our business,

41:36.453 --> 41:38.372
and I will send word
to the jarls.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.542
Margrethe. A moment.

41:45.963 --> 41:48.841
You continue
to give counsel
against me,

41:49.633 --> 41:52.094
to question my judgment,
authority, and competence...

41:52.177 --> 41:53.637
I...
Don't argue!

41:55.556 --> 41:57.933
But now it stops.
You will cease to do it.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.184
The stakes are too high.

42:02.396 --> 42:06.567
But if I hear that
you have spoken against me
one more time,

42:09.695 --> 42:14.116
I will cut out your tongue
and enslave you once more.

42:15.451 --> 42:17.494
Ubbe would have something
to say about that.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.080
Ubbe does not rule Kattegat.

42:20.998 --> 42:23.041
And as long as I rule here,

42:23.667 --> 42:25.711
you will do as I say.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.179
It's Kattegat!

42:37.514 --> 42:38.932
Kattegat!

42:53.697 --> 42:55.741
Why is he here,
the Christian dog?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.201
The heathen!

43:02.581 --> 43:03.749
Kill him!

43:29.274 --> 43:30.275
Kill him!

43:30.692 --> 43:32.361
Christian, die!

43:38.742 --> 43:40.118
Christian dog!

43:50.921 --> 43:54.132
Now we decide
whether you'll fight with us,

43:57.344 --> 43:58.637
or whether I kill you.

44:07.646 --> 44:11.608
Nothing is keeping
you alive but me.

44:19.783 --> 44:21.577
Why don't you
give me the knife?

45:00.365 --> 45:02.534
Die!

45:02.618 --> 45:04.036
Are you afraid?

45:10.375 --> 45:11.376
Do it.

45:13.503 --> 45:15.547
Coward! Do...

45:42.491 --> 45:44.076
I think he will fight with us!

45:50.916 --> 45:53.377
Heahmund! Heahmund!
