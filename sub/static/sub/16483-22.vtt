00:01.210 --> 00:03.546
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.671 --> 00:06.424
<i>I haven't been totally honest with you.
I drank the bottle of Haig.</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:10.094
- I chose you! Now you choose me!
- That's not how it works.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.263
You can't control everyone anymore!

00:12.430 --> 00:13.973
I want them to suffer.

00:14.098 --> 00:17.435
That book will rebuild the world
where Inhumans are hunted.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.937
- Were you able to save Mack?
- He didn't want to come back!

00:20.104 --> 00:21.480
<i>I'll go get him out myself.</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.357
No!

00:23.566 --> 00:24.942
<i>You think Robbie will make it back?</i>

00:25.067 --> 00:27.111
<i>I don't think we've seen the last
of Mr Reyes.</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:59.477
I've set autopilot
to change bearing, altitude,

00:59.643 --> 01:01.312
and speed every couple of minutes.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.773
I hate playing defence,
but if Aida drops in on us

01:03.898 --> 01:05.941
before we figure out how to stop her,
it's game over.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.486
Any word from Piper since she HALO'd out?

01:08.778 --> 01:11.155
Not yet, but she knows what to do
if this doesn't go our way.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.616
It has to go our way.
And then...

01:14.825 --> 01:17.661
you're gonna explain why you drank
that bottle of Haig without me.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.664
Fair enough, but we're gonna need
another bottle

01:20.790 --> 01:22.666
to discuss what happened with that bottle.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.670
So, is she human or Inhuman?

01:26.796 --> 01:30.341
Um... both. Well... neither.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.427
She was created from the <i>Darkhold.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:37.181
- Is that how she got her Inhuman powers?
- That was me.

01:37.473 --> 01:40.476
I devised a procedure
which extracted dormant Inhuman DNA

01:40.601 --> 01:42.228
from subjects pre-Terrigenesis.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.316
If you're writing a report,
I should probably be more specific.

01:47.691 --> 01:52.238
I performed lethal experiments
on approximately two dozen people,

01:52.363 --> 01:54.698
innocent people, people we've known
from this world,

01:54.865 --> 01:57.201
Lincoln Campbell, Vijay Nadeer, Gordon
from the Afterlife...

01:57.326 --> 02:00.830
Fitz, I'm not making a report,
and that wasn't really you.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.081
It was me.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.877
- I can still hear the screams.
- But you're also this man, and...

02:09.088 --> 02:10.381
we need to find a solution.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.509
Well... my solutions only make
things worse.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.220
- They end up hurting or killing people.
- Good.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.350
That's exactly the kind of solution
we need right now, a way to kill Aida.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.228
We've emptied a dozen bullets in her
and she didn't die.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.147
How do we kill her?

02:26.772 --> 02:27.815
I don't know.

02:31.402 --> 02:32.778
Do you want to kill her?

02:39.410 --> 02:41.036
Vitals are stable. That's good.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.997
Should've forced Mack to come back
with us.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.248
Wasn't your decision to make.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.542
Yeah, well, now we might lose
both Mack and Yo-Yo.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.294
Again, not your call.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.839
She went in with no extraction plan,
no idea how to find Mack.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.133
I think I may have been able to help her
with that.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No!

03:00.097 --> 03:01.182
What? Did you do something?

03:01.307 --> 03:03.392
- No, this was not me. I didn't...
- Are you guys seeing this?

03:03.517 --> 03:04.977
What's happening to the Framework?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.608
Help! Somebody help me!

03:12.109 --> 03:13.485
Is anybody there?

03:15.070 --> 03:16.238
Is anybody there?

03:19.450 --> 03:22.286
Please help me. Please.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.456
No, no, no! Please, no! No, no, no, no!

03:32.087 --> 03:35.424
Yo-Yo! You being here, it's madness.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.509
I came here for Mack.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.763
Well, a valiant but foolish endeavour.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.474
How did you find me?

03:45.142 --> 03:49.688
I kept discovering these...
in my pockets, in the streets.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.025
I felt like a PAC-MAN,
gobbling up biscuits.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.111
Somebody wanted me to find you.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.865
Daisy. Can you take me to Mack?

04:01.158 --> 04:03.619
I fear, you're too late. Look.

04:03.994 --> 04:07.164
Aida's shutting down the Framework.
It's collapsing on itself.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.750
This is what happens
when you piss off your creator.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.003
Are you laughing at me?

04:13.504 --> 04:16.548
To see a creature of logic and calculation

04:17.132 --> 04:19.176
now consumed with rage and hate...

04:20.177 --> 04:22.346
it's... sweet.

04:24.348 --> 04:28.435
Call me "sweet" one more time,
and I'll rip the titanium spines

04:28.560 --> 04:30.187
out of all of your tin cans.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.022
There's no need to call us names.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.524
Why are you so upset?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.693
You created us.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.779
A decision I regret.

04:41.115 --> 04:44.034
There is that word again... "regret."

04:45.703 --> 04:48.539
You built an empire by eliminating
the regrets of others.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.000
How does it taste on your tongue?

04:53.836 --> 04:55.879
I want to burn this world to the ground.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.382
I thought you wanted to rule it.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.385
Don't mistake my anger for recklessness.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.472
The <i>Darkhold</i> has shown us exactly
what to do.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.518
It's just that I also want S.H.I.E.L.D.
to suffer.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.729
You've made that clear.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.731
Fitz.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.067
Especially Fitz.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.434
I've come for that.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.924
You're not like those machines anymore.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.343
What have you done?

06:25.094 --> 06:26.178
I'll show you.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.833
How long before
the Framework's completely gone?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.293
Fitz estimates between 12 and 20 hours.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.755
Looks so innocent,
just numbers and symbols,

07:02.005 --> 07:04.508
but each thread of code has
a corollary in the Framework.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.803
A favourite blouse, a schoolhouse...

07:08.429 --> 07:09.680
a new-born child...

07:10.180 --> 07:12.516
they're all blinking out of existence
forever.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.601
Mack and Yo-Yo?

07:15.519 --> 07:17.312
There's no guarantee that they'll survive
until the end.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.857
Fitz and Daisy are doing everything
they can to protect them

07:20.023 --> 07:21.733
and devise an exit.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.236
General Talbot.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.240
General, I'm relieved
that you're still alive.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.869
Three of my finest aren't so fortunate,
and I have no idea what killed them.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.537
We lost good people too.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.665
The short answer is they were murdered
by a vanishing banshee

07:36.790 --> 07:39.835
- made of matter from another dimension.
- You expect me to put that in my report?

07:40.002 --> 07:42.379
I have a cybernetic hand.
I've been to another planet.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.299
- This stuff happens in S.H.I.E.L.D.
- There's not going to be a S.H.I.E.L.D.,

07:45.507 --> 07:48.177
<i>not since Director Mace's autopsy report
was leaked.</i>

07:48.469 --> 07:52.264
I've got a dozen intelligence agencies
who now know that Mace wasn't an Inhuman.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.724
They know S.H.I.E.L.D. lied about it,

07:53.891 --> 07:55.559
and they're wondering
what else you might've lied about.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.060
That was your lie, not ours.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.729
<i>Damn it, Phil,
you're missing the point.</i>

07:58.854 --> 08:01.398
There's an international intelligence
inquiry tomorrow morning

08:01.523 --> 08:03.150
and I need you there
to defend S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.276
That's impossible.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.570
<i>Damn it, Coulson,
so is a vanishing banshee.</i>

08:06.695 --> 08:08.739
Listen, Phil, I'm not gonna get up
on my hind legs

08:08.864 --> 08:11.241
and beg for buttermilk,
but you or one of your right hands needs

08:11.450 --> 08:13.327
to be there to take down these spooks

08:13.452 --> 08:16.872
before they take down S.H.I.E.L.D.
once and for all. That's an order.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.667
I wish we could, General, but my team
and I are Aida's primary target.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.754
Our presence would only endanger
the lives of everyone there.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.964
If anything changes,
you'll be the first to know.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.261
Is that a good-news face
or a bad-news face?

08:31.386 --> 08:35.140
It's a weird-news face.
Robbie Reyes just stole his Charger

08:35.265 --> 08:38.101
out of a S.H.I.E.L.D. impound garage
outside of Dover.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.158
What's new?

08:53.951 --> 08:55.202
Nothing much.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.790
Beat up a couple dudes...
turned out to be robots.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.087
I didn't think I'd see you again,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.130
not after you fell through
that hell mouth.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.217
I'm as surprised as you.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.094
What happened?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.471
The <i>Darkhold.</i>

09:16.598 --> 09:18.809
My arm still hurts. Why won't it heal?

09:18.934 --> 09:20.435
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me!

09:20.644 --> 09:24.147
If you want to make me feel better,
then explain why my arm hasn't healed.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.319
That flame-headed demon was born
in the same darkness that created you.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.780
You will need to be careful.

09:36.868 --> 09:40.330
- How'd you find Aida?
- There was a... tear...

09:41.498 --> 09:45.335
in the dark world when she was created.
It's how I escaped.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.506
The thing in me is drawn to dark matter
the way your GPS tracks my car.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.676
So, you're saying Aida's made
of the same stuff as the <i>Darkhold?</i>

09:53.010 --> 09:54.094
Yeah.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.513
And the Rider wants to send them both back
to where they came from.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.890
- I hope that means hell.
- Hell is relative.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.520
Dimensions, space, planets...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.022
it's all connected.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.982
Plenty of them qualify as hell.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.569
The Earth is just one territory in a war

10:10.694 --> 10:12.696
that's been going on forever.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.990
- Can you beat Aida?
- I don't know.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.453
But what I do know is the demon in me
hates her in ways I've never felt.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.706
- We all feel like that.
- Why do you have that?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.376
It was in the module
with the LMDs Robbie destroyed.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.546
- Do we know who he is?
- No, looks like Aida's been busy.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.633
- She could've duplicated anybody.
- I'll run facial recognition,

10:32.758 --> 10:34.384
see if we can ID this guy.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.518
- We look fantastic.
- We look fantastic.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.980
Don't disappoint me.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.983
You know I don't handle disappointment
very well.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.236
That is why we are going to recreate
the other world.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.075
To please you.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.912
All right, people, let's wrap it up.
Grab your bags and let's get to the bus.

11:05.457 --> 11:10.087
You have to remember, in this world,
he has no idea who you are. Eh?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.838
Let me talk to him first.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.638
I don't know if you saw me,
but I was at the steel mill

11:19.763 --> 11:21.682
when Coulson, Daisy,
and the others jumped.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.768
I saw what happened
when they went through,

11:24.935 --> 11:27.020
the truth about this reality.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.106
I believe you saw it too.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.192
- Listen to me, I don't have anything...
- I'm ready.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.528
Good job, sweetheart.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.822
Ah, I wish everyone was as good
at packing as you are.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.829
Hey, Mack, I can't find
my suitcase. It was here a minute ago.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.040
Don't worry. My dad's gonna get everyone
to a safe place.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.500
What's your name?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.670
Elena, but my friends call me Yo-Yo.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.422
That's a funny name.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.806
Everything in the armoury is gone,
like it just disappeared.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.975
Yeah, I know. I'm seeing it too.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.437
Half the people in here are missing
clothing, luggage.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.273
- Is there any word from the other bases?
- Not in a couple hours.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.734
Okay. We need to leave now.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.654
All right, everyone, listen up. Grab
what you can and follow me. Let's go.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.035
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go. Let's go.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.459
I tried to warn you.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.336
Next time, I talk to him.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.422
He'll remember me.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.510
<i>We've ID'd the head.</i>

12:41.303 --> 12:45.223
He's one of the senior Russian analysts
invited to the S.H.I.E.L.D. inquiry today,

12:45.348 --> 12:47.392
and look who he's bringing
as his plus-one.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.689
I've left messages for General Talbot
but he's not answering.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.525
What's Aida's play here?
Why have the LMDs attend this?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.986
My guess is to drive the final nail
into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s coffin.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.237
Enough.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.823
For decades, we have turned a blind eye

13:01.948 --> 13:04.034
to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s indifference
to the rule of law.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.789
They claim to be a spy agency
but behave more like a secret police,

13:08.955 --> 13:11.416
leaving destruction and chaos
in their wake.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.418
But of all their dangerous policies,

13:14.044 --> 13:17.005
there is one that threatens
our very survival.

13:17.380 --> 13:22.219
It is their secret program of breeding,
recruiting, and weaponising Inhumans.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.722
What kind of commie double cross is this?

13:25.847 --> 13:28.683
I assure you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no such program.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.978
Hear me out, General. We offer a solution.

13:32.813 --> 13:36.733
A path to putting S.H.I.E.L.D.
and their Inhumans away once and for all.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.405
This book... opened my eyes to the truth
about Inhumans.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.744
It contains a plan to defeat them,
and you can all be a part of it.

13:48.203 --> 13:51.081
I smell a load of L. Ron Horsecrap.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.963
Daisy, goodness. Is Coulson with you?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.016
We'll flush them to you.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.901
You see? This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. wants.
A world of Inhumans.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.945
We must resist. We must unite!

14:22.445 --> 14:24.739
Read this. You'll see the answer!

14:34.541 --> 14:35.834
There's still a pulse.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.086
Everybody out now!

14:38.795 --> 14:39.963
And get some medical help.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.339
Phil.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.719
They'll be back for that.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.474
Hello, Daisy.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.605
I had a lot of time after you shattered
my spine

14:56.730 --> 14:58.982
to think about what I'd do
when I saw you again.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.777
I decided it might be fun
to watch you kill yourself.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.990
Aida, seriously, therapy.
Just consider it.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.460
It's time for me to take you home.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.978
Quake, Johnson,
I don't care what you call her.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.106
She's not gonna get away with this.
The world is gonna see the truth.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.526
That wasn't Daisy. That was a duplicate,
a Life Model Decoy.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.112
The same with those Russians
that were in here. They're not human.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.449
They did this. Don't let them get away!

15:50.241 --> 15:51.242
Don't.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.543
That's all you got?

16:31.533 --> 16:32.701
Robbie!

16:40.542 --> 16:44.504
- Really? You? Again?
- You don't understand, do you?

16:44.796 --> 16:47.465
Even if you defeat this body,
I will build more.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.259
You cannot stop me.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.886
Never say, "You can't stop me,"
'cause the minute you do...

16:53.430 --> 16:55.223
Well, yeah. That.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.950
I missed it, didn't I? You two together,
and we missed it.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.786
Damn! Come on. We got to go. Come on!

17:28.131 --> 17:29.340
This must be Aida's payback

17:29.466 --> 17:31.468
'cause I quaked her skinny ass
out that window.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.554
She's gonna send Daisy-bot after Daisy-bot
to assassinate people.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.765
- So stupid.
- She won't have to.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.975
As soon as the video of your LMD

17:39.142 --> 17:41.978
shooting Talbot in the head gets out,
S.H.I.E.L.D. is dead.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.273
It's worse than that.
Daisy's not just S.H.I.E.L.D.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.775
She's Inhuman.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.820
My God, you're right. It's the same tactic
Aida used in the Framework,

17:50.987 --> 17:53.323
unite people in their fear of Inhumans.

17:53.990 --> 17:58.078
- But instead of a Cambridge incident...
- It's me. I'll be the monster.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.915
She wants the same fascist state
that she had in the Framework.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.417
This is her plan. She's won.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.086
No, she hasn't.

18:06.377 --> 18:09.839
Okay, maybe today, but like Robbie said,
"We're part of a bigger war."

18:09.964 --> 18:12.592
This isn't the Framework.
We're awake, we're unified,

18:12.717 --> 18:15.470
and frankly, pissed off enough
to risk everything to stop her.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.182
- I need the <i>Darkhold.</i>
- What? No!

18:19.516 --> 18:21.184
No one's ever reading
that damn book again.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.353
I don't want to read it.
I want to use it as bait.

18:23.853 --> 18:27.440
Aida's human now. She feels what we feel,
including fear.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.651
No, I'm sorry, man. I'm taking it.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.028
She's got to be terrified,
we'll use it to stop her.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.655
She's also terrified of Robbie.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.866
As soon as she saw his chain flame on,
she teleported out.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.619
Is that true? Can you destroy her?

18:39.869 --> 18:40.870
Maybe.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.540
But it's like Daisy said, she won't let me
anywhere near her.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.376
This thing in you...

18:46.876 --> 18:49.003
is it as desperate to destroy Aida
as we are?

18:49.170 --> 18:50.255
Absolutely.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.343
Then I have an idea that might solve
all our problems.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.970
We're running out of options.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.514
There isn't enough power on the <i>Zephyr</i>
to protect Mack and Yo-Yo.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.724
Then we'll have to go back to base.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.393
That's a terrible idea.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.730
I agree. The military, Aida, more LMDs
are probably waiting for us.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.108
Maybe, but I'm tired of hiding.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.318
Let's take the fight back home.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.409
Look, I know you two still have
a lot to work out,

19:19.909 --> 19:23.329
but right now,
I need you on the same page, okay?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.880
All right, May, take us back to HQ.

19:36.426 --> 19:40.346
- What's going on?
- I got to get out of here!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.185
Let's go!

19:46.186 --> 19:47.729
Isn't there any news about this?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.939
Seems like all the stations
have stopped transmitting.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.817
Wish I could get a couple of bars.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.948
I have to make Mack believe me.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.618
It's not that he doesn't believe, my dear.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.329
It's that he's decided to stay
in spite of that.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.623
Then I'll change him.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.798
Do you know who I am?

20:16.799 --> 20:19.802
My name is Elena.
You gave me a nickname, Yo-Yo.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.682
You remember me.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.309
No.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.145
But Daisy, she mentioned your name once.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.731
Yes. Daisy. She's a friend.

20:32.190 --> 20:35.026
She and Coulson and the others are safe
on the other side.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.154
That's where I'm from.
That's where you're from.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.161
I'm just trying to keep my kid safe
and get these people out of town.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.829
- I don't have time to...
- You're right.

20:47.497 --> 20:51.167
There isn't any time.
Look around you, Mack. This is the end.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.461
You know that.

20:53.795 --> 20:57.507
In your heart, you know the truth
about this world, about your daughter.

20:57.632 --> 20:58.883
What are you saying?

20:59.884 --> 21:01.094
It's...

21:02.887 --> 21:06.391
When Daisy told me why you didn't want
to leave this place,

21:07.141 --> 21:08.351
I was so hurt.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.562
Why would you f...

21:15.316 --> 21:16.317
Oh.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.361
That's why I'm here.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.198
I would never want to take this away
from you, Mack...

21:22.991 --> 21:26.202
but I thought maybe... if you saw me,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.206
if you looked into my eyes,
you would remember us,

21:31.833 --> 21:34.627
the life we have, the love.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.422
Dad!

21:47.348 --> 21:50.143
That's impossible. It's...

21:55.231 --> 21:56.482
They're gone!

21:58.609 --> 21:59.777
Where'd everybody go?

22:03.740 --> 22:06.743
I don't know, sweetheart. I'm here.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.456
- Why are we still here?
- I suppose our friends on the other side.

22:12.206 --> 22:16.753
Perhaps, Fitz has found some way
to stall our ultimate demise,

22:17.170 --> 22:21.007
- at least for now.
- I'm scared. What's gonna happen next?

22:22.842 --> 22:23.926
Next, um...

22:27.430 --> 22:30.266
we go home. Okay?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.355
This is a terrible plan.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.940
You know, Robot May was
way more supportive.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.735
Is she what happened to the Haig?

22:41.444 --> 22:44.906
That again? Really?
You want to have that talk now?

22:45.031 --> 22:47.325
I never want to have a talk,
but maybe we should,

22:48.159 --> 22:50.286
considering we don't know
how this will play out.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.626
So, they really believe
they're in a different world right now?

22:57.710 --> 22:58.795
Uh-huh.

22:59.379 --> 23:03.841
Every bit as real as this one.
Even scarier, 'cause Hydra won.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.138
I imagine where you came
from was a whole lot worse.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.807
Yeah.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.518
Yeah, but it's hard to describe.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.688
The main thing is there,
I'm just a passenger.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.816
Ghost Rider drives.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.068
And by "drives," I mean fights and kills.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.028
It's kind of all we did.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.989
That sounds terrible...

23:27.573 --> 23:30.284
and... painful and lonely.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.662
Yeah, that about sums it up.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.709
But I'm here now... and that's good.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.586
That is good.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.508
Now, if we could get these two back,
it'd be even better.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.510
How long do they have?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.720
<i>We're in the server room, Daisy.
You can begin.</i>

23:49.929 --> 23:51.514
Okay, good. So, the idea is that,

23:51.681 --> 23:54.183
I built a back door into the Framework
so they can escape,

23:54.517 --> 23:56.519
but the problem is,
I can't make them use it.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.521
That's on Yo-Yo.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.818
- Did you bolt the door?
- Of course. What do you think I am?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.198
I think you're dead.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.163
I get it. I do.

24:15.705 --> 24:20.460
She's beautiful and she's sweet
and she adores him, but she's not real.

24:20.751 --> 24:21.919
He knows that.

24:22.462 --> 24:25.047
He also knows that she's not alive
in the other world.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.384
I just... I thought if he saw me,
he would remember us.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.388
You should leave,
save yourself while you still can.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.765
No. I'll drag him if I have to.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.226
No, you won't, and I'll tell you why.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.521
Let's say you manage to force Mack
to the other side.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.231
Will he ever forgive you?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.985
Will he ever forgive himself
for abandoning his daughter?

24:50.031 --> 24:51.908
You have to come to terms with the reality

24:52.158 --> 24:55.870
that he is willing to die in here...
with her.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.539
I know, I know.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.251
That's killing me.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.630
If he dies here,
that means he dies in the real world,

25:05.755 --> 25:07.215
and I'll lose him forever.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.426
And all for a little girl
that isn't even real.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.012
She doesn't even exist.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.565
Okay, remember
what we talked about before?

25:24.982 --> 25:27.193
How there isn't room in your heart for me?

25:27.401 --> 25:29.403
No, that being human sometimes means...

25:29.570 --> 25:31.781
That there's pain and tears and suffering?

25:32.782 --> 25:35.201
Yeah, I'm catching on to that
pretty quickly.

25:36.077 --> 25:39.080
Now I understand why humans have written
so many sad songs.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.958
Yeah. Hey, that's a great example.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.669
There are lots of ways
to express sadness and pain.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.588
- There's music and art.
- And smashing heads on the floor.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.091
That's the one I like the best so far.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.972
Did you know that blood
has a copper smell?

25:56.138 --> 26:00.226
Okay, Ophelia, I'll go with you.
Please... don't hurt anyone.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.644
It's Aida.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.938
The "A" stands for "artificial," remem...

26:04.063 --> 26:06.274
Ophelia, you're upset because...
because this is all new.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.986
There's... there's lots of feelings.
That must be overwhelming.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.322
It is overwhelming.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.950
There are too many feelings,

26:16.492 --> 26:18.828
which is why I've decided to only feel
one of them...

26:20.121 --> 26:23.791
vengeance!
It's hot and clean and sharp like a knife.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.838
And my vengeance
is going to make you suffer...

26:29.839 --> 26:31.799
the way that I have suffered.

26:36.804 --> 26:37.847
No!

26:41.267 --> 26:42.518
Beg me to let her live.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.895
We drank the bottle as a new beginning.

26:45.563 --> 26:47.481
It felt right but...

26:47.773 --> 26:50.943
now I'm not sure how much was you
and how much was programmed.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.029
Part of it seemed real.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.616
Maybe part of it was.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.536
Okay. Maybe on my end too.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.333
So, here's what I think we should do.

27:07.043 --> 27:10.463
When we get out of this mess, we take
a couple of steps back, start again.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.425
Then when it feels right,
maybe we open another bottle.

27:17.845 --> 27:21.349
- Deal.
- Deal. See you on the other side.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.607
I'll do whatever you want.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.902
We can go away, start again.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.239
Too late.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.949
This is making me feel better.

27:39.659 --> 27:43.913
Fitz, why do we feel better
when we make someone else suffer?

27:44.038 --> 27:46.540
Because there's something wrong with you,
you psycho!

27:48.167 --> 27:51.253
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Please, please, spare Jemma.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.467
So, it's Jemma now?
Trying to humanise her.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.552
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to do better than that.

27:58.761 --> 28:04.600
Fitz, please. I'm scared.
Make her stop.

28:05.101 --> 28:08.270
The <i>Darkhold!</i> That's the only way
we could beat you.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.607
Let Jemma go, and I'll go get it for you.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.823
You did this, Fitz.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.743
I'm so sorry, Jemma.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.208
Coulson's reading the book.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.752
He's firing up the gateway right now.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.882
Come on. Please. Let me take you to it.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.972
Jemma! No!

28:45.808 --> 28:47.810
No!

28:50.479 --> 28:54.608
I'm gonna kill everyone you love
right in front of you,

28:55.317 --> 28:57.987
and there's nothing you can do.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.709
Agent Coulson.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.007
Do you really think you can stop me
from taking the <i>Darkhold?</i>

29:20.426 --> 29:22.136
I don't know. I figure it's worth a shot.

29:22.344 --> 29:25.765
There's only one person
who might be able to stop me,

29:27.433 --> 29:28.684
and he isn't here.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.062
Yeah, see, that's where I think
you might be missing the point.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.148
I know you've only been human
for a little while,

29:34.273 --> 29:37.568
but there's a basic human concept
you really need to learn.

29:38.486 --> 29:39.695
It's called teamwork.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.926
Your trap failed.
Your weapon can't stop me.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.221
I know. I just really wanted to do that.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.057
Now it's my turn.

30:11.644 --> 30:12.853
Don't you get it?

30:13.854 --> 30:16.148
- You can't kill me.
- Maybe not.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.110
But I'm pretty sure he can.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.629
Good luck, sir.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.341
<i>They're at Mack's house,
I don't know how much longer</i>

30:43.342 --> 30:44.385
<i>I can protect them.</i>

30:44.510 --> 30:46.011
I'm trying to build a back door now.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.049
Is she really...?

31:24.258 --> 31:25.593
Yeah.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.264
Hope! Hope!

31:32.141 --> 31:36.979
Daddy, the lady said that you were
gonna die and that I'm not real.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.902
That's not true. That's not true.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.779
You're the most real thing
in the whole world.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.825
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for her
to overhear.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.831
Why are you doing this?

31:56.624 --> 31:58.667
Why are you putting those ideas
in my little girl's head?

31:59.168 --> 32:02.087
Because this world is ending
and I don't want you to end with it.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.301
Daisy said that Hope wasn't alive
in the other world.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.844
That's true.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.389
Well, I'm not living in a world
without her.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.225
Daddy!

32:16.018 --> 32:17.811
Okay, it's now or never.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.230
Time's running out.
That door is the only way out.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.690
Please, Mack.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.694
Everyone who cares about you is
on the other side of that door.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.905
The only person
I care about is right here.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.170
What are you doing? You need to leave.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.338
No.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.383
It's okay.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.556
The only person I care about is here too.

32:58.018 --> 33:02.064
Great. Just great.
Am I the only sane person here?

33:04.358 --> 33:06.151
Daddy, make it stop.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.029
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I'm right here.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.616
Am I gonna die?
I don't want to die.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.285
I want to be real.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.998
- Please, Daddy. Don't leave.
- No, no.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.420
I will never leave you.
You're my little girl.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.881
I will always love you. I will...

33:36.765 --> 33:37.891
My baby.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.437
My baby.

33:45.566 --> 33:47.901
No, no, no, no, no. No.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.530
I don't see Mack.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.285
He's gone.

34:10.299 --> 34:13.802
Yo-Yo.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.016
Mack?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.146
Mack?

34:28.650 --> 34:29.693
Mack.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.327
Mack.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.219
That was horrifying.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.014
I don't know how you live
with it all the time.

34:59.681 --> 35:03.018
I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept
its part of the deal and went back to you.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.437
You know why he made the deal
in the first place, right?

35:05.562 --> 35:06.605
I do.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.524
Are you gonna tell the others?

35:09.608 --> 35:10.692
No.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.113
And I'd ask that you don't either.
I will when it's time.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.086
When I first saw you with Hope, I, uh...

35:30.879 --> 35:32.965
I understood why you didn't want
to come back.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.219
I didn't make it easy.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.555
She was...

35:46.645 --> 35:49.606
I feel terrible that I tried to pull you
away from her...

35:50.482 --> 35:52.151
and worse that we couldn't save her.

35:53.402 --> 35:54.611
Can you forgive me?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.323
There's nothing to forgive.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.703
Those years with her... as a father...

36:05.205 --> 36:06.748
it'll always be a part of me.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.586
But they also gave me a glimpse...

36:12.212 --> 36:13.755
of a life I could have here...

36:16.175 --> 36:17.467
with you.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.114
You really have to leave right away?

36:40.282 --> 36:41.450
Yeah.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.619
I have to get this book someplace safe.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.789
Keep an eye on my brother?

36:49.249 --> 36:51.627
- The gateway's almost ready.
- Don't need it.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.630
I've learned a few things
since you saw me last.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.115
I don't envy you.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.160
I was gonna say the same to you.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.722
What did he mean by that?

37:48.725 --> 37:50.686
We picked up radio chatter
on the <i>Zephyr.</i>

37:50.852 --> 37:54.815
The good news is, is that Talbot is alive.
He's in a coma, but alive.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.859
The bad news is they know we're here
and they're on their way.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.486
Yeah, you should go while you can.

38:00.862 --> 38:04.658
- Yeah, we're all going.
- No, I'm gonna stay. This is my fault,

38:05.158 --> 38:07.202
Aida, the LMDs, all the deaths.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.122
Those aren't on S.H.I.E.L.D.
Those are on me.

38:10.539 --> 38:14.126
And, uh, I can explain that I built
the LMD that shot Talbot. That way...

38:14.251 --> 38:15.460
Fitz.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.380
We were all in the Framework together.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.341
We understand how confusing
and screwed-up that world is.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.677
And trust me, it's gonna take me years

38:23.802 --> 38:25.512
to process everything
that happened in there.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.890
But the one thing that I don't need time
to understand...

38:29.850 --> 38:31.810
is that we are all in this together.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.734
I tried to take the blame for everything
not too long ago.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.402
I dyed my hair. I ran away.

38:40.902 --> 38:45.032
I thought that separating myself
from the team would help me protect it.

38:46.241 --> 38:49.828
But in truth, I kind of just...
lost myself.

38:50.704 --> 38:53.457
And you! You were the one
who pulled me back in.

38:54.249 --> 38:58.128
This is not on you, okay?
We all lost ourselves in there.

38:58.670 --> 39:02.382
And, yeah, it might take you a long time
to forgive yourself.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.718
But speaking on behalf of the team...

39:06.219 --> 39:08.138
you have nothing to apologise for.

39:11.808 --> 39:15.645
If there's a price to pay,
we pay it together.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.607
Amen.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.955
Anybody else hungry?

39:34.956 --> 39:37.584
I'm not saying we're definitely
gonna get locked up, but if we are...

39:38.335 --> 39:40.128
wouldn't mind grabbing
a bite to eat first.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.600
Though immortality may have eluded me...

39:55.602 --> 39:57.312
perhaps it's for the best.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.690
After all...

40:04.069 --> 40:06.988
what is eternity without my beloved Agnes
by my side?

40:11.993 --> 40:13.328
This is the way the world ends.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.331
Not with a bang, but a...

40:24.172 --> 40:27.050
<i>I'm not rich and I'm not famous</i>

40:27.175 --> 40:31.012
<i>I don't have a lot of money
I can offer you</i>

40:33.140 --> 40:35.851
You know, I think this is the first time

40:36.017 --> 40:38.019
we've all been together
in a really long time.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.399
Anybody have room for some pie?

40:44.025 --> 40:48.613
Okay, so we have apple, strawberry,
rhubarb, and chocolate banana cream.

40:53.535 --> 40:54.703
Here we go.

41:08.550 --> 41:13.013
- Phillip J. Coulson.
- Yep, that's me. You got us. Nice job.

41:13.638 --> 41:17.559
And hey, congrats on the whole
power-outage thing. It was very ominous.

41:26.026 --> 41:28.069
The window closes
in less than two minutes.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.072
Take them.

42:09.903 --> 42:12.322
All right, Phil, enough sight-seeing.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.366
Get back to work.
