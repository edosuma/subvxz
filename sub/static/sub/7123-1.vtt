He's heading
for that cupe!

00:43.777 --> 00:44.709
Come on, Jake.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.972
Oh, yeah.

00:52.452 --> 00:58.677
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.488
What?! He's gone.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.084
What? What happened?

01:02.162 --> 01:03.186
Hey, hey!

01:03.263 --> 01:04.890
Did you guys see that?

01:04.964 --> 01:06.795
You know that was a ghost
wearing a dead guy?

01:06.866 --> 01:08.697
That might be the nastiest
thing I've ever seen.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.635
N-n-n-n-nasty, nasty Jazz.

01:11.704 --> 01:12.796
Nast...

01:12.872 --> 01:14.237
Hey, hey! Easy, buddy.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.535
That's our friend Billy.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.371
He got possessed
by the Lich!

01:17.444 --> 01:18.570
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.805
I didn't mean nothin' by it.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.471
I mean, I have a
lot of nasty friends.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.981
My uncle was nasty.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.040
I'm basically
honorary nasty.

01:25.118 --> 01:26.380
Do you know
where he went?

01:26.453 --> 01:27.784
We have to find our friend.

01:27.854 --> 01:28.912
Who knows.

01:28.988 --> 01:30.615
Uh... oh.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.591
Actually, it depends on
the wish I granted him.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.592
Wish?

01:34.661 --> 01:35.821
Yeah, he wished for the
extinction of all life,

01:35.895 --> 01:37.021
and I did it.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.462
I guess it changed his
timeline or something.

01:38.531 --> 01:39.964
What?! Oh, glob!!

01:40.033 --> 01:41.933
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.764
How can that be if
I'm still here kickin'

01:43.837 --> 01:45.668
it with my main man,
Finn?

01:45.738 --> 01:47.501
Oh, that's because you're
safe in my time room

01:47.574 --> 01:49.303
until you make <i>your</i> wish.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.445
Oh-h-h-h.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.413
I wish that life
wasn't anymore exti...

01:55.482 --> 01:56.779
Whoa! Wait, Jake.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.044
Don't mess this up.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.107
Think about it.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.652
If we wish everything
back to normal,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.153
the Lich could just
jazz it up again.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.314
Oh, yeah.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.381
Jazz.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.948
Hmm.

02:07.026 --> 02:08.755
Hmm.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.058
Hm-m-m-m.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.189
I got it!

02:12.265 --> 02:14.631
I wish...

02:14.701 --> 02:16.828
The Lich...

02:16.903 --> 02:18.700
never...

02:18.771 --> 02:20.432
even ever existed.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.241
Mom?

02:25.311 --> 02:26.539
Mom, what's wrong?

02:26.613 --> 02:28.478
Finn, I need you to
do something for me.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.480
It's very important.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.642
I need you to take
the mule into

02:31.718 --> 02:34.152
town today and sell him
for as much as you can.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.050
What?

02:35.121 --> 02:36.179
Sell Bartram?

02:36.256 --> 02:38.349
But I love Bartram.
What the heck, mom?!

02:38.424 --> 02:39.356
Shh!

02:39.425 --> 02:41.757
Finn, please.
Just do as I say.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.520
- Got it?
- Dad?

02:44.597 --> 02:46.326
I push you.
You fall down.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.794
The Destiny Gang?

02:48.868 --> 02:49.766
Finn, please.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.497
Everything will be fine,
I promise.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.004
Now, just do as I say.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.533
I'm sorry, Bartram.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.204
I guess dad must be in real
trouble to be doing this.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.613
But I bet there's a lot of fine
folk lookin' to buy a good mule.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.345
Why, I bet I could even
come visit sometimes.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.614
Won't that be swell,
Bartram?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.121
Bartram?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.623
Dang it, Bartram.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.885
Bar-bar?

03:12.959 --> 03:14.290
What the...

03:14.360 --> 03:16.021
Bar-bar, how'd you
get up there?

03:22.268 --> 03:23.826
Jake, look!

03:23.903 --> 03:25.427
A golden crown!

03:25.505 --> 03:26.802
Unbelievable!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.602
We can sell it
<i>and</i> keep Bartram!

03:28.675 --> 03:29.642
Bong bong!

03:29.709 --> 03:31.142
Hold it right there!

03:31.211 --> 03:32.644
Who are you?

03:32.712 --> 03:37.081
I'm a thousand years old,
and this is <i>my</i> crown.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.208
Okay, okay.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.876
But, um...

03:39.953 --> 03:42.683
maybe I could just...
borrow it for a little while?

03:42.755 --> 03:43.585
No!

03:43.656 --> 03:45.647
No! No!

03:45.725 --> 03:47.784
This crown is magic.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.760
Bad, terrible magic.

03:49.829 --> 03:54.357
Too dangerous for mortal
fingies like yours!

03:54.434 --> 03:59.497
One thousand years ago, my
beloved friend, Simon Petrikov,

03:59.572 --> 04:02.132
gave his life to
save this foolish,

04:02.208 --> 04:05.666
unworthy planet
from annihilation.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.873
A frightful bomb
was poised to

04:08.948 --> 04:12.042
bathe the land
in mutogenic horror.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.746
But using his mastery
of ice and snow,

04:14.821 --> 04:19.190
Simon froze the bomb in
mid-flight only inches

04:19.259 --> 04:21.317
from the ground,

04:21.394 --> 04:24.124
where it remains to
this very day,

04:24.197 --> 04:25.255
today,

04:25.331 --> 04:28.027
ever-ripe and
ready to blow.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.535
But he alone
was not saved.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.300
Trapped under the giant weight
of the enormous bomb,

04:34.374 --> 04:37.343
poor Simon perished.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.604
Little help?

04:38.678 --> 04:42.808
And the horrible crown,
grieving its lost master,

04:42.882 --> 04:46.409
loosed a spasm of magic
so wild and crazy,

04:46.486 --> 04:53.289
the entire Earth was buried
in ice for 400 boring years.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.754
Uh...

04:55.828 --> 04:58.194
None of that is true,
'cause magic is fake.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.664
Daddy says the false prophets
of old used cheap parlor tricks

05:00.733 --> 05:02.928
to control the people,
and to get babes,

05:03.002 --> 05:04.970
like 10 or 12
hot babes each.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.563
No! Magic is real!

05:07.640 --> 05:09.471
Lady, you been
down here too long.

05:09.542 --> 05:14.206
- Why don't you just let...
- Step off, or I will use this!

05:14.280 --> 05:15.770
Lady, quit it
with that thing!

05:15.848 --> 05:17.440
I'm sorry.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.179
You must die!

05:22.088 --> 05:23.282
Aah?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.246
Ooh.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.883
Um...

05:26.959 --> 05:28.722
Oh, man!

05:28.795 --> 05:30.558
This thing...
dang it!

05:30.630 --> 05:31.562
Go, Jake!

05:32.632 --> 05:33.621
Aah!

05:33.700 --> 05:36.863
Go back to the underworld, you beast!

05:38.271 --> 05:39.101
Sorry!

05:39.172 --> 05:40.196
I got to save my dad.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.265
Destroy the world,
more like!

05:44.243 --> 05:45.107
Dummy!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.372
I give up.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.845
<i>The crown...</i>

05:47.914 --> 05:49.347
<i>Go get it.</i>

05:49.415 --> 05:51.940
I know you're not
really talking to me.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.542
I'm not crazy!

05:53.619 --> 05:55.314
<i>Get the crown!</i>

05:55.388 --> 05:56.514
<i>Go get it!</i>

05:57.490 --> 05:59.151
<i>Get the crown, Marceline!</i>

05:59.225 --> 06:00.214
<i>Go get it!</i>

06:00.293 --> 06:02.625
I can't...
my knees!

06:02.695 --> 06:04.925
<i>Well, that's real</i> ly
<i>disappointing, I must say.</i>

06:04.997 --> 06:05.929
<i>I'm just...</i>

06:05.998 --> 06:07.124
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:08.827
<i>You're really letting</i>
<i>me down right now.</i>

06:08.901 --> 06:10.664
Okay. All right.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.163
Cool crown!

06:14.240 --> 06:15.502
Who wants a cool crown?!

06:15.575 --> 06:17.304
I found it on a
dead magician dude!

06:17.377 --> 06:18.344
I'll take it.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.241
Awesome!

06:19.312 --> 06:20.301
How much cash you got?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.007
Oh, I'm poor.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.311
Uh, but what about I trade
you for a personal concert

06:24.384 --> 06:25.612
at your house?

06:25.685 --> 06:27.949
I'll come over later and
sing you like four songs.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.682
I mostly do covers,
but I have originals, too.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.850
Do you own any spoons?

06:32.925 --> 06:34.051
No.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.253
Let me see that!

06:35.328 --> 06:36.352
Hey!

06:36.429 --> 06:37.293
Heh.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.824
Wait. Destiny Gang.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.664
I got to sell that
to pay you guys!

06:43.736 --> 06:45.601
Trami, what you think?

06:45.671 --> 06:47.298
Is it my style?

06:47.373 --> 06:48.704
Big Destiny will know.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.902
Yo, boss!

06:50.977 --> 06:52.035
Snap!

06:52.111 --> 06:53.806
Huh? What is this?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.848
Are you telling me
what to wear, Trami?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.076
No, boss!
You look good!

06:58.151 --> 06:59.880
You think I should
re-invent my style

06:59.952 --> 07:02.250
and put a stupid thing
on my head?!

07:02.321 --> 07:03.481
No, man!

07:03.556 --> 07:05.217
You tell <i>us</i> what to wear!

07:05.291 --> 07:07.316
Otherwise, you would
dress like an idiot!

07:07.393 --> 07:09.452
Bam! Crown shorts.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.019
Amazing!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.894
Yeah-ha-hah.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.062
Clap harder, trash bag.

07:19.672 --> 07:20.866
Okay, you guys.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.931
Give me my money or
leave my parents alone.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.910
Property of old dead person
go to Big Destiny.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.007
One arm needs to
learn the rules,

07:29.081 --> 07:31.276
unless you want your
butt handed to you.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.375
I guess it wasn't
really mine.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.013
It's mine!
I'm a demon.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.146
Half demon.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.282
Tromo, jack up crazy lady.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.054
Trami, take mule back
to crib for din-din.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.186
What?!

07:46.232 --> 07:47.164
Bar-bar!

07:47.233 --> 07:48.461
Tough luck, one-arm!

07:53.739 --> 07:56.367
See you soon,
bad style junk town!

07:58.144 --> 07:59.168
Bar-bar.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.110
End of the road, bat lady.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.442
Oww, my bones!

08:03.749 --> 08:04.613
Aah!

08:06.919 --> 08:08.011
My eye!

08:08.087 --> 08:09.384
I will junk your face!

08:09.455 --> 08:10.979
What the...

08:11.057 --> 08:13.116
Destiny Gang,
get out of town!

08:13.192 --> 08:15.592
We're sick of
being bullied around!

08:15.661 --> 08:16.787
Yeah!

08:16.863 --> 08:19.627
You make big mistake!

08:19.699 --> 08:21.496
Especially you, one-arm.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.229
My name is Finn Mertens!

08:24.303 --> 08:26.271
And tell Big "D"
I'm coming for my stuff!

08:26.339 --> 08:28.330
Oh, you come and try!

08:28.407 --> 08:29.635
Are you okay, lady?

08:29.709 --> 08:31.176
You must promise to...

08:31.244 --> 08:35.044
promise to return the crown
to its hide-hole.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.308
I promise.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.782
You'll need this, Finn,
if you want to win.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.010
Choose Bruce.

08:40.086 --> 08:40.984
What is it?

08:41.053 --> 08:42.850
It's a weapon for your arm.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.688
With this,
you will defend from harm!

08:46.759 --> 08:47.726
Hmm.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.557
Feels natural,
like peeing outside.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.892
Sort of.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.194
Best not to take the lift,
my friend,

08:54.267 --> 08:57.293
else the D-Gang
will see you coming in!

08:57.370 --> 08:58.359
No.

08:58.437 --> 09:00.098
I want them to see me.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.437
I'm-a go up there and
show them my face!!

09:08.180 --> 09:10.842
Aah?

09:10.917 --> 09:12.350
Hello?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.716
Bar-bar? I'm coming!

09:15.788 --> 09:17.415
Bar-bar!

09:18.591 --> 09:20.354
I want my stuff, you big dump.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.088
You want Big D's crown, huh?

09:27.166 --> 09:28.258
Yeah!

09:28.334 --> 09:29.301
And Bar-bar!

09:29.368 --> 09:30.232
Here you go, then.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.235
Wha...?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.169
That is your
final possession,

09:33.239 --> 09:35.503
the last thing you
will ever own.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.475
What do you... mean?

09:38.511 --> 09:40.240
Look down there, stupid.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.440
Town is on fire, see?

09:44.517 --> 09:46.075
I made it on fire.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.483
Fix up junk town.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.884
Look at old man cry!

09:50.656 --> 09:52.851
That's what happens
when you mess with Big D!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.290
You get crush!

09:54.360 --> 09:55.918

10:07.139 --> 10:09.539
All my stuff is "goan!"

10:09.609 --> 10:11.839
Now they're going after your...

10:11.911 --> 10:13.378
Home!

10:15.381 --> 10:16.973
Bar-bar, come on!

10:17.049 --> 10:18.914
Hurry, Finn!

10:18.985 --> 10:22.045
You can win!

10:23.923 --> 10:24.753
Finn!

10:24.824 --> 10:25.688
Return...

10:25.758 --> 10:26.747
I will.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.259
But we got to stop
the D-Gang first.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.294
Come on, Jake!

10:30.296 --> 10:31.456
Good boy!

10:32.965 --> 10:34.296

10:34.367 --> 10:35.299

10:35.368 --> 10:36.232

10:38.537 --> 10:40.334

10:40.406 --> 10:42.772

10:45.511 --> 10:47.035
Mom! Dad!

10:47.113 --> 10:48.637

10:50.549 --> 10:51.811
You said this
thing is magic?

10:51.884 --> 10:54.944
Yes, powerful and dangerous.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.421
But you lost your
mind in a cave.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.548
Whatever.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.387
You just got to
believe me, okay?

11:00.459 --> 11:02.086
