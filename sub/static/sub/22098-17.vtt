WEBVTT

00:22.147 --> 00:24.440
NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.150
(GUN FIRING)

00:33.117 --> 00:36.577
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.621
You have to really stay.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.625
GINA: You must betray Roslin and run
for President in the upcoming election.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.461
I know it's hard,
but it's the only way.

00:45.671 --> 00:48.673
Word of Fisk's murder has spread
out through the entire fleet.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.800
TIGH: A crew can fall apart
when their commander's killed.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.219
Pegasus lost two
in a matter of weeks.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.054
I'm putting Garner in command.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.390
But he's an engineer,
not a command officer.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.808
He's the best they got.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.869
Pegasus, Buster.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.580
Dradis intercept
training birds are away.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.291
HOSHI: Buster, Pegasus. Roger
that. Take station as briefed.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.209
Be advised communications
will suffer

01:25.294 --> 01:28.796
sporadic interruptions due to
stellar EMI activity, acknowledge.

01:28.881 --> 01:32.341
BUSTER: Pegasus, Buster.
Acknowledge. Our communications suck.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.926
It's gonna be like this
all day?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.094
Big time.

01:35.179 --> 01:38.556
Those binaries are putting out so much
EMI, even the dradis is barely working.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.768
Well, I'm gonna put a little
distance between us and the fleet.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.688
Get us out of this soup, see if we
can get a cleaner dradis picture.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.322
Hey!

01:54.406 --> 01:56.949
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go! Come on!

01:57.201 --> 01:59.619
Got a couple of tired Viper
jockeys out here who want to sleep.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.496
Go hit the showers, Duck.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.123
We'll be gone by the time
you get back.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.333
(GROANING)

02:09.046 --> 02:10.046
How you feel?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.048
Oh, not great.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.635
But Cottle's given me
the thumbs-up,

02:15.719 --> 02:18.304
and it's been almost a month,
so I guess it's back to work.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.349
So you ready to go
into the belly of The Beast?

02:21.433 --> 02:22.934
The Beast?
Yeah.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.061
That's what they call
the Pegasus now.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.437
Galactica's The Bucket.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.688
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:27.773 --> 02:29.816
The Bucket and The Beast.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.192
Huh.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.529
Don't we make a pair?

02:35.781 --> 02:36.781
Come on.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.990
No, you come on.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.075
Come on, come on, go.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.037
Anyway, it's only
a temporary assignment.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.958
I should be back again
in a couple of weeks.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.752
Why'd the old man pick you?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.879
One word, Starbuck.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.172
Is she in hack again?

02:53.257 --> 02:54.465
(CHUCKLING)

02:54.842 --> 02:56.133
Not yet.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.678
But apparently she's been
driving Commander Garner

02:58.762 --> 03:02.431
up one bulkhead and down the other ever
since she took over flight training on,

03:02.641 --> 03:04.934
what did you call it?
The Beast.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.188
And since I won't be flying
combat for a while, I...

03:09.606 --> 03:10.690
APOLLO: Oh.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.071
Were you gonna mention these?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.824
Oh, yeah.
I got promoted to Major.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.536
Well, don't sound so happy.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.037
Doesn't mean much.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.581
I think it means a lot.

03:26.832 --> 03:30.293
Oh, well, if you say so,
then it must be true.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.339
(MOANING)

03:36.383 --> 03:37.508
TYROL: So what's going on?

03:37.593 --> 03:40.761
We were unloading one of the containers
and then one of the crates shifted.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.432
So we looked inside and we
saw that something was moving.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.766
Did you call it in?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.603
Yeah. We shut the door and
the Marines are on their way.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.730
Give me a light.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.237
Chief, we don't know what
we're dealing with here.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.488
Don't you think
we should wait?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.450
Just wait out here.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.659
Chief?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.624
Is this the Galactica?

04:53.377 --> 04:54.543
Yeah.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.381
Are you Doctor Cottle?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.100
(DISTORTED CHATTERING
OVER RADIO)

05:10.894 --> 05:12.645
What the hell was that?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.522
I don't know.
We should call it in.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.399
I'm gonna spin up
the FTL drive just in case.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.442
LYLA: Pegasus,
this is Raptor 718.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.112
(DISTORTED CHATTERING
OVER RADIO)

05:21.196 --> 05:22.780
Say again, Shark.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.079
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.124
Buster, Shark, do you read?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.419
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.504
OFFICER:
Commander Garner on deck.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.256
Buster, Shark, do you read?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.383
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?

05:42.467 --> 05:43.592
Not sure, sir.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.596
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an
emergency, but their transmission's garbled.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.855
We've lost them, sir.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.745
OFFICER 1:
I want us to recheck that.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.664
OFFICER 2: Okay, I need to check if we're
getting some readouts on the problem.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.458
Yeah? All right,
I'll check again.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.879
Welcome aboard, Major.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.800
I didn't expect
a welcoming committee.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.886
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.429
Major Adama, sir.

07:10.514 --> 07:11.514
Major Adama.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.307
Commander Garner.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.727
Glad to see you, Major, although I
wish it was under better circumstances.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.523
We have just lost contact with two of
our Raptors out on a training mission.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.149
What? When did that happen?

07:22.234 --> 07:25.319
Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were
actually down on the flight deck

07:25.403 --> 07:28.989
and monitoring your Raptors, the way any
training officer worth a damn would have done,

07:29.074 --> 07:31.408
you would know that four
of our pilots were missing.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.244
Major.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.206
You with me, Major?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.332
Yes, sir.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.002
They disappeared from the dradis
about an hour ago. They're gone.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.050
Shut the hell up!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.805
We lose two Raptors
in a training mission,

07:52.889 --> 07:56.058
and I only find out when the
Commander throws it in my face?

08:00.856 --> 08:01.897
Don't all speak at once.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.860
Sir, it's been made clear that
discussing flight deck situations

08:05.944 --> 08:09.196
with anyone outside
Pegasus crew is not allowed.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.531
Sorry, sir.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.410
And whose frakking
bright idea was that?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.417
It was Garner, wasn't it?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.087
STARBUCK: Of course it was.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.215
So barely competent
and paranoid.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.925
Huh.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.178
There's
a hell of a combination.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.180
I've a problem.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.432
That problem's name
is Kara Thrace.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.852
I know how to handle her, sir.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.981
And for the record, she is
one hell of a Viper pilot.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.318
What, I should cut her some slack
because she's good in the cockpit,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.069
is that what you're saying?

08:49.988 --> 08:53.407
Because nobody ever cut us
any slack in the engine room.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.826
I can tell you that right now.

08:56.703 --> 09:01.415
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe
is different than being a Viper jockey.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.876
No flashy stunts for us.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.378
No flying by the seat
of our pants down there.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.798
The engine room is like
a finely-tuned watch,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.593
and everything in it needs
to be monitored and maintained

09:12.677 --> 09:15.095
in a very precise fashion.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.473
Nobody freelances.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.018
Everything is done in the
proper way, at the proper time,

09:21.102 --> 09:22.895
in the proper order.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.856
Or there'd be no power,
no lights,

09:26.483 --> 09:28.817
no hot showers
for your flyboys.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.948
You know, Major, I think some
of the people around here

09:35.492 --> 09:38.118
could learn a thing or two
from the snipes.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.671
I'm sorry, Madam President,
but it's that time.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.297
Oh.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.299
The campaign meeting.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.593
Mmm-hmm. You've been
putting it off for weeks.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.429
And we do have a presidential
election coming up,

09:57.806 --> 09:59.640
unless you've decided
not to run.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.600
I'm gonna be perfectly
honest with you, Tory.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.227
I've thought about it
a few times,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.145
but, no, I'm still here.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.981
There's so much to do, so

10:09.526 --> 10:11.318
let's talk politics.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.528
Great.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.782
Here are the results from
our first fleet-wide poll.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.827
How did you manage this?

10:19.911 --> 10:23.080
I was precinct captain
for the Federalist Party

10:23.164 --> 10:25.374
in Delphi for five years.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.044
We did polls to see what the
mayor should have for lunch.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.381
For what it's worth, you've
managed to walk a very fine line.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.135
Your presidential bid has the support of
both the military and the civilian fleet,

10:36.219 --> 10:38.178
and you've received
enthusiastic endorsements

10:38.263 --> 10:39.888
from the Gemenese
religious leaders.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.518
Well, it helps when your only real
rival is a convicted terrorist.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.482
Am I capable
of leading this fleet?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.485
Absolutely.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.281
And for a time,
I almost had a chance,

10:58.450 --> 11:02.911
until Laura Roslin ascended
from politician to prophet.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.458
The truth is, I can't win.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.502
But you could.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.006
You flatter me,
Mr. Zarek, really,

11:14.215 --> 11:16.258
but I'm not sure I'm cut out
for a life in politics,

11:16.343 --> 11:19.970
as I find the vice-presidency and
everything to do with it very tedious.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.142
I would imagine carrying water for
Roslin would get old after a time,

11:25.226 --> 11:28.937
but it's the office that makes
you the perfect candidate, Doctor.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.689
You're pre-sold.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.817
Really?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.111
To whom?

11:37.614 --> 11:41.492
You'd be surprised how many people
crave the assurances of cold science

11:41.785 --> 11:46.246
as opposed to the superstitious
ravings of the Gemenese.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.875
As a scientist,
you offer hope.

11:51.628 --> 11:52.711
Think about it.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.298
And you, Tom?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.594
You'll just step aside,
will you?

12:02.013 --> 12:05.432
I'm just happy to back
a man of true conviction.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.020
A man who remembers
his friends.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.153
CASE: Attention on deck.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.989
APOLLO: At ease.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.785
Where's Stinger?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.287
He's in hack
for mouthing off to Garner.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.248
Stepped on his
precious little toes.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.457
Frakking Garner.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.084
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:32.168 --> 12:33.669
STARBUCK: He's such an idiot.
He's just...

12:33.837 --> 12:35.504
All right, lock that up!

12:35.964 --> 12:37.840
Get something straight.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.885
We got two missing Raptor crews who
are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.971
That's all that matters.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.517
So everyone knock off the schoolyard
crap and start doing your frakking jobs.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.647
Now, we need to start
thinking outside the box.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.525
Which is supposed to be
what you do best.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.363
Sorry, Major.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.614
All right.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.907
I wanna know everything
there is to know

13:03.992 --> 13:05.617
about these missing Raptors
and their crews.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.829
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft
squawks, wireless transmissions,

13:09.330 --> 13:11.373
anything that might help.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.751
Good. Get to it.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.054
How is she?

13:26.181 --> 13:28.891
Rya's four months pregnant
and doesn't wanna be.

13:28.975 --> 13:33.145
I understand the Gemenese have a problem
with women terminating their pregnancies.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.356
Tyrol said that she asked
for you by name.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.736
Do you want to tell me
what that's really all about?

13:40.904 --> 13:43.906
Pretty straightforward, really. I
get a note that a girl is on the way,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.742
she arrives, I do my work,
and she leaves.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.952
I don't ask
a lot of questions.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.412
You're gonna start.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.582
I wanna talk to her.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.132
I'm Admiral Adama.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.719
Don't worry,
I've just come to talk.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.765
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.730
Your parents are a little
worried about you.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.943
They've contacted me through
the Gemenon representative.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.237
My parents?

14:24.113 --> 14:25.280
Oh, gods.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.993
Do you have any idea
what they would do to me?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.082
Please, do not send me back.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.922
You're a stowaway
aboard a military ship.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.968
COTTLE: Some people might say she
was a victim of political persecution.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.637
Hell, she could
apply for asylum.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.693
Asylum.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.030
That's it. I want asylum.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.002
Under Gemenon law, the girl is
still the property of her parents,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.921
and they can deal with her once
she's safely back on her ship.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.132
To be honest,
I'm more concerned

15:25.216 --> 15:27.092
with the broader implications
of this matter.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.176
Sarah.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.178
I know you don't
wanna hear this,

15:30.263 --> 15:33.265
but my people, my voters, are
demanding action on this issue.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.392
We have been through this.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.437
Abortion was legal under
Colonial law before the attacks,

15:38.521 --> 15:40.689
and so it is still
legal today.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.316
It's obscene.

15:42.859 --> 15:46.778
The scriptures view abortion as an
abomination in the eyes of the gods.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.280
You cannot equivocate
on this point

15:48.364 --> 15:50.866
if you want our support
in the coming election.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.415
Rya Kibby's petition
for asylum is under review.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.543
Thank you, Sarah,
very much, for coming in.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.849
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.476
TORY: Then don't.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.937
But we have to move
aggressively on this thing.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.565
I'm gonna arrange a conference
call with you and the Quorum,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.692
or this is gonna get
out of hand, fast.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.907
She's not Billy.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.117
No, she's not.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.248
(ADAMA SIGHS)

16:48.424 --> 16:49.591
What?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.260
I hate to say this

16:55.765 --> 16:58.266
because I know that
this is a political issue.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.980
The fact is, that number
doesn't go up very often.

17:19.163 --> 17:23.542
I have fought for a woman's right
to control her body my entire career.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.293
No.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.504
No.

17:27.630 --> 17:31.800
I'm just remembering what you
said right after the Cylon attack.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.222
That if we really wanna
save the human race,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.308
we better start having babies.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.652
Nothing, nothing,
and more nothing.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.452
Where is Shark's
last transmission?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.413
Well, there's not much there.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.464
"Eve, distress,
bearing, wreck,

18:10.548 --> 18:12.591
"shuns, emerge, read. "

18:13.760 --> 18:15.510
They're in distress.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.847
They give a bearing
requesting instructions,

18:19.015 --> 18:21.266
"It's an emergency.
Can you read?"

18:21.851 --> 18:24.603
Maybe. But what's this
"eve" fragment here?

18:24.687 --> 18:28.231
"Eve, distress. "
"Eve, distress. "

18:33.863 --> 18:35.697
(WHISPERING) Distress call.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.993
Eve. Receive... Received.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.207
Received distress call.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.044
Okay. From who?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.379
I don't know.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.508
But maybe that's where
they went, to go find out.

18:56.052 --> 19:00.055
APOLLO: Commander, Captain Thrace has
a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.641
That's good,
considering she lost them.

19:02.725 --> 19:03.934
Excuse me?

19:04.018 --> 19:06.186
Well, they were out on one of
your so-called training missions,

19:06.270 --> 19:07.312
weren't they, Captain?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.147
My "so-called"
training missions.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.482
Okay, let's just
take this easy.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.109
That's when you're not boozing
or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.277
Mutiny.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.029
Commander, we should take this
to a private place.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.990
Don't you think I know what's
happening on my own ship?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.036
"Barely competent
and paranoid. "

19:24.914 --> 19:27.749
That was off the record.
I was just venting.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.835
Accurately.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.878
I'll have you court-martialed.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.090
Commander, I'm not defending
Captain Thrace's behavior...

19:35.174 --> 19:36.216
Thanks, Major.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.261
Captain Thrace,
you're restricted to quarters

19:39.428 --> 19:41.721
until I can ship you back
to Galactica.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.891
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.689
Major?

19:50.773 --> 19:51.773
Sir.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.873
You've been onboard less than four
days and you're already facing charges.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.374
You don't waste any time,
do you?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.042
Neither do you, Lee.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.253
How's it feel being
Garner's new playmate?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.838
I'm here to do a job.

20:14.922 --> 20:19.217
Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient,
frak-up Kara Thrace in line.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.053
Not doing such a good job,
are you?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.638
Evidently not.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.142
We don't have much time, those
guys are running out of air.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.185
Yeah, well, I tried,
all right?

20:29.687 --> 20:32.647
All I have done since I got
to The Beast is try and help,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.816
and all I've gotten is
Garner's foot in my ass.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.902
Well, maybe you need
a kick in the ass!

20:39.655 --> 20:40.947
All right.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.451
Here we go, finally.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.912
What is your problem, anyway?

20:46.996 --> 20:50.248
What's my problem?
What's my problem?

20:50.791 --> 20:54.085
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up,

20:54.170 --> 20:55.712
and I keep having
to clean it up,

20:55.796 --> 20:57.756
and I am officially
sick of it.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.259
Poor Lee, your life
is so hard, isn't it?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.011
You mean since I got shot?

21:33.876 --> 21:36.544
You wanna hear what I think
happened to Buster or not?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.719
Pegasus, Red Devil. I'm
nearing the last coordinates

21:44.804 --> 21:46.471
where our Raptors
went missing.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.682
SHARK: (ON RADIO)
Repeat, emer...

21:49.225 --> 21:50.475
There are...

21:50.559 --> 21:52.560
RED DEVIL:
Buster, is that you?

21:52.645 --> 21:56.064
This is Red Devil, man. Is that
you, buddy? Come back to me.

21:56.649 --> 22:00.151
SHARK: (ON RADIO) Out of
power. Oxygen almost out.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.904
By the gods, help!

22:05.658 --> 22:09.744
Sir, one of our search Raptors just
picked a possible distress signal

22:09.829 --> 22:12.831
from near where Pegasus lost
communications with Buster's ship.

22:12.915 --> 22:13.915
Finally.

22:16.877 --> 22:21.256
A possible distress signal. There's a theory
that Buster himself might have jumped away

22:21.549 --> 22:24.634
to run down a phony distress
call. It could be a trap.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.929
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.390
This is Captain Thrace's
theory, is it not?

22:33.185 --> 22:36.563
Mr. Thornton, can you give us a fix on
where this distress signal is coming from?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.940
Yes, sir, it's long range,
over 40 SU away.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.359
Then spin up the FTL drive
and prepare to jump the ship.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.652
Yes, sir.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.950
Sir, this isn't just
Captain Thrace's theory.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.369
I think this is a Cylon trap,
and...

22:51.454 --> 22:53.121
And I disagree.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.666
Now get Admiral Adama
on the line.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.127
I'm going to get our men.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.347
Admiral, we've finally got the
break we've been looking for,

23:11.432 --> 23:12.849
a bearing on
the distress signal.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.559
I can jump there
inside of two minutes.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.145
Commander, believe me,
I understand how you feel.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.565
The Cylons have been known
to lure our ships into traps

23:20.649 --> 23:22.734
using fake distress calls.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.069
Have you considered that?

23:24.153 --> 23:27.197
We have, sir. It's a scenario
we don't think likely.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.406
We?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.494
Major Adama, do you concur?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.373
Sir,

23:38.334 --> 23:41.920
Captain Thrace and I are of the
opinion that the first two Raptors

23:42.004 --> 23:44.422
may very well have been lured
away by just such a trick.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.466
An opinion
I do not share, sir.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.805
We'll send a recon mission
in full force.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.556
Five Raptors.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.017
Three escort, two rescue.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.937
You have your orders,
Commander.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.730
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.693
Thank you, Major.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.155
I'm sure your expertise
is needed elsewhere.

24:10.825 --> 24:11.908
Yes, sir.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.544
Yes, I am curious.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.924
Why the sudden interest in the
fleet's demographic projections?

24:28.008 --> 24:31.636
An issue has emerged that may prove
divisive to our administration.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.140
I would like all the facts in
hand before making my decision.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.892
So now it's
our administration.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.436
She must be desperate.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.360
Well, I'm a very busy man.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.822
Luckily, I made an initial calculation
on these figures over seven months ago

24:50.906 --> 24:52.782
when nobody seemed interested
or concerned.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.285
All I had to do was factor in
the numbers from the Pegasus crew.

24:55.411 --> 24:58.037
It took me hardly any time
at all and I didn't mind.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.082
Look, I'll save you the bother.
You needn't read the report.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.752
If we continue
on our present course,

25:05.337 --> 25:09.924
within the next 18 years, the
human race will simply be extinct.

25:14.597 --> 25:17.849
ROSLIN: (ON PA) Since assuming the
Presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain

25:17.933 --> 25:21.603
the rights and freedoms we so
enjoyed prior to the attack.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.732
One of these rights has now
come into direct conflict

25:26.358 --> 25:28.693
with the survival
of the species.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.989
And I find myself forced to
make a very difficult decision.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.950
The issue is stark.

25:37.745 --> 25:42.040
The fact is that if this
civilization is to survive, we must,

25:42.458 --> 25:44.792
must repopulate this fleet.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.796
Therefore, I am issuing
an executive order.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.549
From this day forward,

25:51.634 --> 25:54.761
anyone seeking to interfere
with the birth of a child,

25:55.512 --> 25:57.555
whether it be the mother

26:00.684 --> 26:02.727
or a medical practitioner,

26:04.939 --> 26:07.190
shall be subject
to criminal penalty.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.151
Thank you.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.325
OFFICER: (ON PA SYSTEM) All flight deck
personnel, please report to stations.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.619
CASE: All right, come on.
Let's go! Let's go!

26:19.703 --> 26:21.579
Captain Case, what's going on?

26:21.664 --> 26:23.456
We've been ordered
to scramble, condition one.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.376
Ship's getting ready to jump, we're
gonna launch on the other side.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.502
Get down to the hangar deck.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.586
What?

26:28.879 --> 26:32.131
Look, you're the best pilot we've got,
so get down there, and find a Viper.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.925
It's about time you
admit that!

26:36.679 --> 26:37.887
Commander, what's our sitrep?

26:37.972 --> 26:39.430
This is a rescue mission,
Major.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.556
On whose authority?

26:40.641 --> 26:42.517
Mine. I'm bringing
my pilots home.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.521
All due respect, sir,
but if this is a Cylon trap,

26:46.605 --> 26:49.315
then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...

26:49.400 --> 26:53.444
My pilots are dying down there, Major.
I'm going in. I'm not waiting on recon.

26:53.529 --> 26:56.114
Commander, this is in direct
violation of the Admiral's orders.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.949
Major, leave combat...

26:58.033 --> 26:59.534
Making this an illegal action
on your part, sir.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.202
You are relieved, Major.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.453
Sergeant of the Guard.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.830
I am forced to take command
of this vessel...

27:03.914 --> 27:05.623
This man is in direct
disobedience of an order...

27:05.708 --> 27:07.709
...under federal regulations
and place you under arrest.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.298
Sergeant, take him below.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.302
Sergeant, the Commander has been properly
relieved. Escort him to his quarters.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.887
This man is not a member of
this crew, and you will obey

27:19.972 --> 27:23.391
a direct order that you have been
given by me, and you will do it now.

27:33.527 --> 27:36.321
Major, if you'll come with me.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.581
Admiral, the Pegasus
has jumped. They're gone.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.136
Dradis signal's clean. Jump put
us clear of any interference.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.388
Sir, I show two Raptors.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.307
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.519
Mr. Hoshi, tell the CAG to launch our
recovery team, and let's bring our people home.

28:08.604 --> 28:09.604
Aye, sir.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.536
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.539
I can't quite see inside yet.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.376
Commander, we're unable to
raise the Raptors on wireless.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.268
Pegasus, both Raptor crews
are dead.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.146
I repeat, they're all dead.

28:56.693 --> 28:57.985
(BEEPING)

28:58.487 --> 29:01.447
Sir, three Cylon Baseships
just jumped into weapons range.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.990
Oh, my gods.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.204
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact!

29:10.499 --> 29:11.916
(GROANING)

29:12.835 --> 29:14.127
(ALARM BLARING)

29:20.134 --> 29:21.509
(GLASS SHATTERING)

29:23.429 --> 29:24.971
(CREW SHOUTING)

29:27.182 --> 29:28.307
Damage report.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.227

would've been sufficient.

what you always did.

one of our freedoms,

or curtail one of our rights,
