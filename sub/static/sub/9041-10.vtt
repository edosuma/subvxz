WEBVTT

00:02.267 --> 00:04.667
- I HAD AN AMAZING NIGHT
LAST NIGHT.

00:04.667 --> 00:05.800
I WAS AT THE SPORTS BAR,

00:05.800 --> 00:08.267
AND I MET THIS REALLY,
REALLY HOT WOMAN.

00:08.267 --> 00:09.267
- HOT WOMAN, YEAH?

00:09.267 --> 00:10.500
SO GET TO THE PART

00:10.500 --> 00:13.633
WHERE YOU NOTICE
HER ADAM'S APPLE.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.833
- BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S ALL WOMAN, OKAY?

00:15.833 --> 00:17.367
HER NAME'S NATASHA.

00:17.367 --> 00:19.367
SHE'S PRETTY.
SHE'S GOT A GREAT PERSONALITY.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.333
I'M TELLING YOU, RAYMOND,
WE REALLY HIT IT OFF.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.700
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.100
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED,
YOU RAN OUT OF SINGLES?

00:32.567 --> 00:35.033
- WILL YOU STOP?
WILL YOU JUST STOP ALREADY?

00:35.033 --> 00:37.033
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE REALLY LIKED ME.

00:37.033 --> 00:38.533
THERE WAS JUST
ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.

00:38.533 --> 00:39.633
- WHAT?

00:39.633 --> 00:41.267
- WELL, IT--IT'S REALLY
NOT A PROBLEM,

00:41.267 --> 00:42.733
SHOULDN'T EVEN
USE THE WORD "PROBLEM."

00:42.733 --> 00:44.400
IT'S JUST A MINOR,
MINOR, MINOR THING.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
- ALL RIGHT!
WHAT?

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

00:46.400 --> 00:49.833
- SHE THINKS I'M YOU.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.000
[laughs]

00:55.933 --> 00:57.300
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.700
YOU MET A WOMAN
WHO THINKS THAT YOU'RE ME?

00:59.700 --> 01:01.200
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M AT THE BAR, RIGHT?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.700
AND SHE SPILLS
HER DRINK ON ME,

01:02.700 --> 01:03.900
AND WE START TALKING,

01:03.900 --> 01:06.233
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
WE REALLY CONNECTED.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.767
I WAS ACTUALLY
QUITE CHARMING.

01:10.767 --> 01:13.300
AND THE BARTENDER
PASSES ME A TOWEL, RIGHT?

01:13.300 --> 01:15.100
AND HE GOES,
"UH, HERE YOU GO, MR. BARONE."

01:15.100 --> 01:16.100
AND WE'RE IN A SPORTS BAR,

01:16.100 --> 01:17.600
SO SHE JUST ASSUMES

01:17.600 --> 01:19.933
THAT I'M RAY BARONE
FROM "NEW YORK NEWSDAY!"

01:19.933 --> 01:22.600
[laughs]

01:24.333 --> 01:26.067
- AND YOU DIDN'T CORRECT HER?

01:26.067 --> 01:29.167
- SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.333
SHE'S A BIG FAN OF YOURS.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.433
- YEAH, BUT LISTEN,
YOU CAN'T--

01:33.433 --> 01:36.133
WHOA, A HOT WOMAN
IS A BIG FAN OF MINE?

01:38.533 --> 01:41.800
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.900
- DID SHE MENTION
ANY PARTICULAR COLUMN?

01:45.900 --> 01:49.333
- WELL, SHE DID SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT A CAL RIPKEN PROFILE

01:49.333 --> 01:52.100
JUST BEFORE WE...

01:52.100 --> 01:53.667
[singing]
BAH-BAH BAH-BAH BAH-BAH!

01:53.667 --> 01:55.867
- NO!
NO!

01:55.867 --> 01:57.533
COME ON, FIRST NIGHT?

01:57.533 --> 02:01.533
- BIG FAN.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.700
- HA!

02:02.700 --> 02:07.067
I DID GET A LOT OF GOOD FEEDBACK
ON THAT PIECE.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.267
- YOU CERTAINLY DID.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.800
- HEY, WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.000
IF SHE KNOWS MY WRITING,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.467
THEN SHE MUST KNOW
I HAVE A WIFE.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.967
- HAD.
HAD A WIFE.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.867
- YOU SAID I WAS DIVORCED?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.633
- WIDOWER.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.933
- YOU KILLED DEBRA?

02:28.933 --> 02:31.033
- HAD TO BE DONE.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.367
BUT DON'T WORRY.

02:32.367 --> 02:35.100
YOU STUCK BY HER
THROUGH A VERY LONG ILLNESS.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.667
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.967
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER HAD ANY CHILDREN.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.367
- WHAT?

02:40.367 --> 02:42.433
- I COULDN'T LEAVE
ANY LOOSE ENDS.

02:42.433 --> 02:44.833
- HEY, LOOK, MAN, YOU GOT
TO SET HER STRAIGHT.

02:44.833 --> 02:47.333
THIS IS NOT RIGHT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.267
- I KNOW,
BUT I REALLY LIKE HER,

02:49.267 --> 02:50.767
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BLOW THIS, YOU KNOW?

02:50.767 --> 02:53.733
I JUST HAVE TO PICK
THE RIGHT TIME TO TELL HER.

02:53.733 --> 02:55.067
GOT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.867
- ALL RIGHT, BUT JUST MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DO IT,

02:56.867 --> 02:58.067
BECAUSE IT'S WRONG, MAN.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.200
IT'S WRONG WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.200
- I KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.367
SO HOW HOT WAS SHE?

03:06.367 --> 03:10.067
- OH, RAYMOND,
SO OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.500
- OH.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.800
OH, I LOVE WHEN THEY'RE OUT
OF MY LEAGUE.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.833
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,

03:16.833 --> 03:18.900
LET ME ASK YOU,

03:18.900 --> 03:20.567
WHILE YOU WERE--

03:20.567 --> 03:22.767
DID SHE SAY MY NAME
OR ANYTHING?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.867
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY!

03:24.867 --> 03:26.100
- OH.
OH, I'M SORRY.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.400
DID I CROSS OVER
SOME MORAL LINE, RAY?

03:31.567 --> 03:32.700
- ALL RIGHT.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.000
JUST SUFFICE TO SAY
SHE WAS REALLY INTO YOU.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.867
- OH.
GREAT.

03:37.867 --> 03:41.300
I FINALLY HAVE SEX.
I'M NOT EVEN THERE.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.433
- SHE WAS A DYNAMO!

03:47.433 --> 03:50.000
- OH, REALLY?
- OH, YEAH.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
- HOW WAS I?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.267
- SO-SO.

03:57.567 --> 03:58.733
[doorbell rings]

04:01.667 --> 04:03.433
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO ME?

04:03.433 --> 04:04.867
THIS WAS SENT TO MY OFFICE.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.167
COME ON.

04:06.167 --> 04:07.900
"TO THE BEGINNING
OF A WONDERFUL ROMANCE.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.567
LOVE, NATASHA."

04:09.567 --> 04:12.067
OH, I CAN'T HAVE THIS THERE.
IT'S LIKE A TIME BOMB.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.767
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT OVER.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.167
BYE-BYE.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.733
- WELL, I GET AT LEAST
TWO OF THESE BROWNIES.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.400
- NO, THE BROWNIES
ARE FOR ME, THANK YOU.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.900
- WELL, COME ON.
I BROUGHT THE THING OVER.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.767
- I'M HEADING FOR WORK NOW,
SO I'LL SEE--

04:21.767 --> 04:24.133
OH, HI.
- HI.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.400
- NATASHA,

04:25.400 --> 04:28.433
THIS IS MY BROTHER, ROBERT.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.500
BROTHER ROBERT,
THIS IS MY FRIEND NATASHA.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.167
- WELL, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU, ROBERT.

04:35.167 --> 04:38.033
RAY HAS SAID
SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.167
- HE HAS, HAS HE?

04:42.167 --> 04:43.767
- OH, YOU SHOULD HEAR
HOW HE BRAGS ABOUT YOU.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.200
"WHAT A GREAT COP ROBERT IS."
YOU'RE LIKE HIS HERO.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.700
- AW.
HA.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.500
RAY.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.267
- HE'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT
YOUR COMMENDATIONS

04:54.267 --> 04:55.767
AND YOUR PROMOTIONS.

04:55.767 --> 04:56.800
- REALLY?
YEAH.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.133
YEAH, THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.800
THEY GIVE YOU THOSE
JUST FOR SHOWING UP.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.433
YEAH.

05:01.433 --> 05:04.100
- YEAH, BUT RAY SAID YOU WERE
WOUNDED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.033
- OH, OH, OH, YEAH.
HE TOLD YOU THAT?

05:06.033 --> 05:08.900
YEAH, THAT WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF STUPID.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.200
I, UH--I ALLOWED MYSELF

05:11.200 --> 05:15.600
TO GET GORED IN THE ASS
BY A BULL.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.633
- [sighs]
DON'T BE SO MODEST.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.067
FIRST OF ALL,
HE WAS SAVING PEOPLE.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.500
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
THE UPPER THIGH.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.933
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
RIGHT IN THE ASS.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.800
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.467
REALLY, REALLY STUPID.

05:28.467 --> 05:30.800
AND I STILL COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.267
- OH, WILL YOU STOP IT?

05:33.267 --> 05:34.500
STOP BEING SO FUNNY.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.033
EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M THE FUNNY ONE.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.500
HE'S THE FUNNY ONE.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.100
THIS GUY IS A CRACK-UP.
YOU'RE A GREAT COP.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.667
GET OUT OF HERE.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.700
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU KNOW, I'M AN OKAY COP,

05:45.700 --> 05:47.400
BUT I WOULD RATHER BE
A GREAT WRITER

05:47.400 --> 05:48.500
LIKE MY BROTHER, RAYMOND.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.400
I MEAN, HE'S A CULTURAL HERO.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.800
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
I'M JUST A SCRIBBLER.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.333
- A SCRIBBLER, YEAH.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.333
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
THE PROFILE OF CAL RIPKEN, JR?

05:56.333 --> 05:57.400
- OH, I LOVED THAT PIECE.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.433
- REALLY?
YEAH, ME, TOO.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.200
ME TOO.
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.733
ROBERT'S PLANNING
A CLOTHING DRIVE

06:01.733 --> 06:03.700
FOR THE POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.400
HE JUST CAN'T STOP
WITH THE GIVING.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.667
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU TWO.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.633
- NO?

06:17.633 --> 06:20.100
- I'VE NEVER MET TWO BROTHERS
WHO GET ALONG SO WELL

06:20.100 --> 06:22.567
AND ADMIRE EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

06:22.567 --> 06:24.200
IT'S UNREAL.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.067
- IT IS UNREAL.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.367
- WELL, SOMEBODY
RAISED YOU RIGHT.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.133
YOU MUST HAVE AMAZING PARENTS.

06:34.367 --> 06:35.733
- YEAH.
[clears throat]

06:35.733 --> 06:38.633
THEY WOULD AMAZE YOU.

06:38.633 --> 06:39.733
- I GOT TO GO.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.333
I HOPE TO BE
SEEING YOU AGAIN, ROBERT.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.433
- OH, YEAH!
YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.333
- OH, HOW DID THIS GET HERE?

06:46.333 --> 06:48.400
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
ROBERT BROUGHT THIS OVER.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.067
HE STOPPED BY MY OFFICE
THIS MORNING

06:50.067 --> 06:51.667
AND DELIVERED IT HERE.

06:51.667 --> 06:52.833
ALWAYS THINKING OF ME.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.233
- MM.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.533
HEY, RAY, COULD I GET
ONE OF THOSE BROWNIES?

07:00.133 --> 07:02.967
- CERTAINLY.
- OH.

07:02.967 --> 07:04.700
THANKS, RAY.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.767
- [laughs]

07:06.767 --> 07:09.100
THAT'S FUNNY.
RAY DOES THAT CHIN THING TOO.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.700
- HMM, YEAH, WE'RE BOTH IDIOTS,
'CAUSE WE DO THAT.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.933
- THAT'S CUTE.
THAT'S CUTE.

07:17.933 --> 07:18.933
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, RAY.

07:18.933 --> 07:19.933
- MM.

07:19.933 --> 07:21.267
[chuckles]

07:28.633 --> 07:30.300
I SWEAR TO GOD

07:30.300 --> 07:32.000
I WAS GONNA TELL HER
LAST NIGHT.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.067
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE KNOWS

07:34.067 --> 07:35.767
WHAT A GREAT GUY
ROBERT IS, SEE?

07:35.767 --> 07:38.400
I'M TRYING TO GET HER
TO FALL FOR ME.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.700
- YEAH, LIKE SHE'S GONNA
DUMP ME FOR YOU?

07:42.700 --> 07:46.467
- YOU WATCH.
I'M SLOWLY MAKING THE TRANSFER.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.667
I BUILD UP WHO ROBERT IS,

07:47.667 --> 07:49.933
THE KIND, COMPASSIONATE
POLICE OFFICER,

07:49.933 --> 07:52.700
AND I DOWNPLAY THE SHALLOW,
HEARTLESS SPORTSWRITER

07:52.700 --> 07:54.367
UNTIL SHE SAYS, "GEE, RAY,

07:54.367 --> 07:56.100
I WISH YOU WERE
MORE LIKE YOUR BROTHER,"

07:56.100 --> 08:00.633
AND THEN, TA-DA!

08:00.633 --> 08:05.800
- TA-DA?
YOU'RE A PSYCHOTIC LIAR.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.067
COME ON.
JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.367
- I'M GONNA.
- TONIGHT.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.433
- BUT THERE'S GROUNDWORK.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.333
- PSYCHOTIC!
- ALL RIGHT!

08:17.800 --> 08:20.100
I'LL TELL HER TONIGHT.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.200
- ALL RIGHT.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.667
SHE IS PRETTY, THOUGH.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.967
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
- MM.

08:29.967 --> 08:33.200
WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.533
- MINE TOO.
- YEAH.

08:35.533 --> 08:37.167
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE
NEITHER ONE OF US

08:37.167 --> 08:40.100
COULD'VE GOTTEN HER
ON OUR OWN, BUT--

08:43.933 --> 08:45.167
- BUT MELDED TOGETHER,

08:45.167 --> 08:49.233
WE WERE LIKE
A WHOLE OTHER ENTITY,

08:49.233 --> 08:52.233
LIKE A SUPERHERO.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.800
WE WERE BETTER
THAN JUST RAY.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.133
- BETTER THAN JUST ROBERT.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.033
- WE WERE

08:59.033 --> 09:01.400
RAYBERT.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.367
COME ON.
YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY OUT ANYWAY.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.433
YOU CAN'T HELP YOUR BROTHER

09:14.433 --> 09:16.033
WITH HIS LAUNDRY
DOWN THE STAIRS?

09:16.033 --> 09:17.133
WE'RE RAYBERT.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.667
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, RAYBERT.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.500
WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT
IN HERE ANYWAY?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.700
- JUST SOME SOCKS
AND UNMENTIONABLES.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.033
- YEAH.

09:25.033 --> 09:27.533
TOO BAD
THEY'RE NOT UNSMELLABLES.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.000
- HEY.
- HEY.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.667
- YOU KNOW HER?
- YEAH, RIGHT.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.600
- HEY, LET ME HELP YOU SORT
SOME OF THIS STUFF OUT, RAY.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.267

11:02.200 --> 11:06.700
- OH, YOU CAN'T
TIE RAYBERT DOWN LIKE THAT.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.867

BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

12:20.433 --> 12:23.500
WE MAY HAVE UNLEASHED
AN AWESOME POWER HERE.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.367
BUT WITH THAT POWER
COMES RESPONSIBILITY.

12:27.367 --> 12:31.000
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.600
YOU GOT TO START WORKING
ON MY WARDROBE.

13:01.467 --> 13:02.833
I'M HIS MOTHER.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.200

13:04.200 --> 13:07.100
I'M INTERESTED
IN MY SON'S FRIENDS.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.567
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME, NATASHA?

13:09.567 --> 13:10.667
- LEONETTI.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.467

ITALIAN!

13:12.467 --> 13:14.033
- WELL, ON MY FATHER'S SIDE.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.333
- GOOD ENOUGH!
COME ON IN, DEAR.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.233
- I JUST WANTED TO DROP OFF
SOME THINGS

13:18.233 --> 13:20.100
FOR THE POLICE CLOTHING DRIVE.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.633
- OKAY.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.667
I MEAN, YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO LEAVE THEM HERE,

13:23.667 --> 13:25.733
BUT YOU MIGHT DO BETTER
TAKING THEM TO HIS PLACE.

13:25.733 --> 13:28.067
- OH, I'M SORRY.
THIS ISN'T ROBERT'S HOUSE.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.467
I SAW "R. BARONE"
IN THE PHONE BOOK.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.200
I JUST ASSUMED--
- IT'S OKAY.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.000
WE'LL MAKE SURE
THAT HE GETS THEM.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.267
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

13:34.267 --> 13:37.267
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.167
WELL, ANY GORGEOUS FRIEND

13:51.167 --> 13:53.633

13:55.800 --> 13:57.567
WHERE IS RAY?
I WANT TO SEE HIS DEAD TOENAIL.

13:57.567 --> 14:02.100
I THINK I GOT

14:02.100 --> 14:04.367

14:04.367 --> 14:08.633

PUTTING THE KIDS TO BED.

14:08.633 --> 14:12.667
- KIDS?
WHAT KIDS?

14:12.667 --> 14:14.067
- HOW DO YOU--

14:14.067 --> 14:16.067
WAIT, HOW DO YOU KNOW RAY?

14:16.067 --> 14:20.567
- WE MET AT A BAR.

14:20.567 --> 14:23.100
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THROUGH ROBERT?

14:23.100 --> 14:25.033
- NO, NO, NO,
I MET ROBERT THROUGH RAY,

14:25.033 --> 14:27.733
'CAUSE RAY AND I
ARE KIND OF DATING.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.600
- [gasps]

14:35.967 --> 14:39.167
- HOLY CRAP!

14:43.067 --> 14:44.833
- WAIT A MINUTE.

14:46.567 --> 14:49.133
- UM, NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.300
I'M JUST SURPRISED

14:50.300 --> 14:55.000

WAIT A MINUTE!

15:28.533 --> 15:30.267
- DIDN'T I TEACH YOU ANYTHING?

15:30.267 --> 15:31.633
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR WOMAN,

15:31.633 --> 15:34.300
YOU DON'T GO OUT
AND GET ANOTHER WOMAN!

15:34.300 --> 15:38.100
NOW ALL YOU GOT
IS TWO PROBLEMS!

15:38.100 --> 15:41.500
- JUST WAIT A MINUTE!

15:41.500 --> 15:45.033
- OKAY, JUST BACK IT UP,
EVERYBODY.

15:45.033 --> 15:46.667

15:46.667 --> 15:48.900
- THAT'S NOT ROBERT.
THAT'S RAYMOND.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.200

15:50.200 --> 15:51.733

15:51.733 --> 15:53.600
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

16:04.900 --> 16:08.533

FORGET IT.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.700
[clears throat forcefully]

17:10.700 --> 17:15.067
I AM ROBERT BARONE,
LIEUTENANT, NYPD,

17:15.067 --> 17:16.900
AND THIS IS MY BROTHER,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.200
RAYMOND,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.800
SPORTSWRITER, "NEWSDAY."

17:20.800 --> 17:23.500
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

17:25.633 --> 17:27.300
- WHEN YOU FIRST MISTOOK ME
FOR RAYMOND,

17:27.300 --> 17:29.233
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET YOU DOWN.

17:29.233 --> 17:32.033
- SO YOU LIED TO ME?

17:32.033 --> 17:33.167
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

17:33.167 --> 17:36.100
- NO, NO, WAIT, NATASHA,

17:36.100 --> 17:37.333
LISTEN.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.267
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
SO MANY TIMES.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.733
IT'S JUST
THAT I REALLY LIKED YOU,

17:40.733 --> 17:44.167
AND I DIDN'T WANT--

17:44.167 --> 17:46.767
YOU SEE, PEOPLE SEEM
TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY

17:46.767 --> 17:48.367
TO RAYMOND.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.567
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE FUNNY ONE,

17:50.567 --> 17:51.933
THE SMART ONE,

17:51.933 --> 17:53.500
THE FAVORED ONE.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.600
- WE'VE NEVER SHOWN
ANY FAVORITISM.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.033
- SEE, YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND

18:07.033 --> 18:08.300
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED

18:08.300 --> 18:11.200
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
TO BE RAYMOND.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.133
AND IT WAS EVEN BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

18:14.133 --> 18:16.967
BECAUSE I MET YOU.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.100
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.400
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.633
I LIKED YOU.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.367
- REALLY?

18:31.967 --> 18:33.833
- NOT ANYMORE.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.700
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.700
- I HEAR YOU.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.667
- AND WHAT DID YOU THINK,

18:38.667 --> 18:40.800
I WAS SOME
RAY BARONE GROUPIE?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.967
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:42.967 --> 18:46.300
GOOD-BYE, WHOEVER YOU ARE!

18:54.467 --> 18:57.400
- [laughs]

18:58.600 --> 18:59.900
IT'S NOT YOU.

18:59.900 --> 19:05.000
IT'S THAT SHE SAID,
"RAY BARONE GROUPIE."

19:05.000 --> 19:06.433
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

19:06.433 --> 19:09.267
- THAT'S GOT TO BE
A PRETTY SMALL GROUP.

19:09.267 --> 19:13.333
ALL YOU GOT LEFT IS HER.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.700
I'LL SAY THIS, ROBERT.

19:14.700 --> 19:18.867
YOU'RE SCARING OFF
A BETTER CLASS OF BROAD.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.167
- ALWAYS THERE FOR ME, DAD.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.467
- HE'S RIGHT.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.933
WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME HELP YOU, ROBBIE?

19:24.933 --> 19:27.100
- HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HELP HIMSELF.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.700
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

19:30.700 --> 19:32.367
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE?

19:32.367 --> 19:34.633
I MEAN, PLEASE,
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

19:34.633 --> 19:40.000
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE
A LITTLE MORE SELF-ESTEEM!

19:41.667 --> 19:44.067
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M AN IDIOT.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.700
- YES--NO!
THAT'S--NO!

19:45.700 --> 19:49.067
THAT--THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.367
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA SEE

19:50.367 --> 19:54.233
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
SEE IN YOU, ROBERT?

19:55.900 --> 19:58.367
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.200
IT'S JUST IT STARTED
AS A MIX-UP,

20:00.200 --> 20:01.767
AND THEN RAYMOND AND I

20:01.767 --> 20:04.600
JUST STARTED
HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH IT.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.633
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:05.633 --> 20:09.667
RAY AND YOU?

20:09.667 --> 20:12.633
- BY "RAY," HE MEANS HIM
'CAUSE OF THAT THING HE DID.

20:12.633 --> 20:14.167
YEAH.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.600
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU, RAY.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.000
I MEAN, IT'S MY FAULT.
I ENJOYED BEING RAYBERT TOO.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.500
- RAYBERT?

20:25.500 --> 20:27.600
- YEAH.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.267
THAT'S WHAT WE CALLED US.
IT WAS FUN.

20:30.267 --> 20:31.333
AND IT WORKED.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.633
THERE WAS NATASHA

20:32.633 --> 20:34.200
AND THEN THE GIRL
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.200
- THE GIRL IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM?

20:47.167 --> 20:50.167
- [changes voice]
I GO FIX SPRINKLER NOW.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.200
- OH, GOOD, HE'S HERE.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.567
DAD, THIS IS RAY BARONE.

21:01.567 --> 21:02.433
- UM--

21:02.433 --> 21:03.767
- THAT'S NOT RAY BARONE.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.200
- WHAT?
- I'VE SEEN HIM IN INTERVIEWS.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.500
- LISTEN--

21:07.500 --> 21:09.033
- THIS GUY TOLD YOU
HE WAS RAY BARONE?

21:09.033 --> 21:12.067
- YEAH.

21:12.067 --> 21:15.200
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?

21:15.200 --> 21:17.433
- YOU'RE NOT RAY BARONE?

21:17.433 --> 21:21.133
- I HAVE SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.600
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

21:23.600 --> 21:28.133
- NO ONE KNOWS.

21:28.133 --> 21:31.067
- STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER,
UNDERSTAND ME?

21:31.067 --> 21:32.333
OR I'LL CALL THE COPS.

21:32.333 --> 21:37.300
- ACTUALLY, I AM A COP.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.700
- YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME NOW?

21:43.967 --> 21:45.300
LET'S GO.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.967
FROM NOW ON,
YOU DO YOUR LAUNDRY AT HOME.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.767
- WEIRDO.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.333
- THAT DOESN'T HELP
MY SELF-ESTEEM!
