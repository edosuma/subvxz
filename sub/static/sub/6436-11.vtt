00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
(theme music playing )

00:26.736 --> 00:29.523
( footsteps )

00:41.000 --> 00:43.286
( footsteps )

00:45.671 --> 00:47.536
Doctore: It is never
an easy thing

00:47.715 --> 00:51.833
to see a friend once loved
now absent breath.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.720
He should yet walk--

00:58.726 --> 01:01.092
that foolish grin

01:01.270 --> 01:04.603
and dreams of a life
beyond these walls.

01:09.028 --> 01:12.065
Every night breaks

01:12.240 --> 01:14.652
and we must all wake.

01:23.209 --> 01:26.793
Why won't the gods
turn back the sun

01:26.963 --> 01:29.329
and set me in his place?

01:29.507 --> 01:31.873
He fought with honor,

01:32.051 --> 01:33.757
as did you both.

01:33.928 --> 01:38.046
His heart was stilled
for a boy's amusement.

01:39.475 --> 01:42.512
Where is the honor in that?

01:44.981 --> 01:47.723
Varro left this world
a gladiator

01:47.900 --> 01:49.982
and shall be remembered
as such.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.143
No.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.735
He will be remembered

01:56.909 --> 02:01.369
as a husband,

02:01.539 --> 02:05.657
a father

02:05.835 --> 02:08.747
and a friend
amongst enemies.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.094
Aurelia.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.804
Is it true

03:05.978 --> 03:08.264
that he perished
by your sword?

03:14.153 --> 03:17.145
He loved you as a brother.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.660
Lucretia: He's not going to
take this loss well.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.329
And who can fucking
blame him?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.466
Calavius slaughters
my stock

03:43.641 --> 03:45.506
at the whim of his maggot,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.766
shits upon my ambitions,
mocking me in my own house--

03:47.937 --> 03:51.850
no, not a loss to be taken
fucking well

03:52.024 --> 03:55.516
but one that will be
answered in kind.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.559
Out.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.196
He is a magistrate.
To move against him--

04:01.367 --> 04:02.732
He is but a man.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.775
And all men fall
beneath the heel of their hubris.

04:04.954 --> 04:06.160
Quintus.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.787
Turn thoughts to other matters.
What of ||ithyia?

04:08.958 --> 04:11.119
Does she move to secure us
her husband's patronage?

04:11.293 --> 04:13.625
She has departed for Rome
to meet Glaber.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.162
Welcome news.
The support of a legatus

04:16.340 --> 04:18.752
should be more than enough
to gain political office.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.962
| only regret
Calavius will not live

04:21.137 --> 04:25.597
to see the unworthy
name of Batiatus so elevated.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.725
The very thought of discovery
turns the stomach.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.682
Make it a thing of iron
and see it settled.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.142
What news?

04:40.406 --> 04:43.068
Speak.
Caress my ear with words.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.234
You will find them
soft and pleasing.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.825
We set upon the magistrate
on the road leaving the city.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.411
- The guards and the wagon?
- Attended to as instructed,

04:52.585 --> 04:56.169
the man himself
removed to the appointed place.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.169
- Ashur?
- Standing watch.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.002
I will relieve him
by cover of night.

05:01.177 --> 05:04.135
I shall accompany.
I would gaze into the man's eyes

05:04.305 --> 05:06.637
and see the power
of my reflection in them.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.549
Until such time avail yourself
of my hospitality-- wine, women.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.934
- Both would suit me.
- And so deserved.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.389
Dominus.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.062
It's done then?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.101
No.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.238
It's only just begun.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.885
Behold the glorious
champion of Capua.

05:50.059 --> 05:53.802
A heavy heart
weighs a man's sword.

05:53.979 --> 05:57.813
The loss of a brother is heartfelt
by every gladiator.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.816
We honor him
not with tears,

06:00.986 --> 06:02.647
but with blood
spilled in the arena.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.107
Spoken as a true champion.

06:06.951 --> 06:09.408
The games against Pompeii
approach.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.990
Years l have been robbed
of the primus

06:12.164 --> 06:14.155
by Solonius and his bribes.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.745
Finally it is secured
by our dominus.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.160
And who fights?

06:19.338 --> 06:21.249
Spartacus,

06:21.423 --> 06:23.334
the woman who grieves.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.592
Spartacus,

06:30.766 --> 06:32.176
you are summoned.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.358
Is this truly my likeness?

06:50.536 --> 06:52.367
Have so many
years passed

06:52.538 --> 06:54.699
that marble must be etched
with such lines?

06:54.873 --> 06:59.412
Would that every man lived
to see his face so marred.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.249
And the wretched pass
smooth of skin.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.045
Varro's death has been foremost
in my thoughts.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.212
lt seizes the breast
to lose a gladiator of such standing.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.006
The comparison is false

07:14.184 --> 07:17.017
to a son losing his father,

07:17.187 --> 07:18.893
a wife-- her husband.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.850
A burden, to be sure.
Yet he was aware of the risks

07:21.025 --> 07:25.064
- and took them of his free will.
- As a gladiator,

07:25.237 --> 07:27.944
not a child's plaything.

07:29.742 --> 07:33.326
The magistrate and his whelp
have caused us both pain.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.702
It will not go unanswered,
I promise you.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.873
I would be of service
toward the deed.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.581
Take comfort
from knowing its intent.

07:43.756 --> 07:47.123
I would have your focus turned
towards the games of Pompeii.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.634
That perfumed shit Solonius

07:50.804 --> 07:54.012
always secured the primus
by inserting tongue in ass,

07:54.183 --> 07:56.094
only to be crushed

07:56.268 --> 07:58.725
by our city's hated rival.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.512
But this year
he falls out of favor.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.726
This year
the House of Batiatus

08:03.901 --> 08:06.142
secures the honor.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.936
Spartacus, bringer of rain,

08:09.114 --> 08:11.730
to face Pericles,
titan of Pompeii.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.025
It is to be sine missione?

08:14.203 --> 08:16.910
No quarter given,
no mercy shown.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.867
And the purse?

08:19.041 --> 08:21.248
To be on a footing
with the match itself.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.455
I would see it paid
to Varro's wife.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.044
A substantial sum. You would see it all
pass from your fingers?

08:29.218 --> 08:32.085
Along with future winnings
that I claim in the arena.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.423
A noble gesture,

08:37.601 --> 08:39.466
one I shall see matched.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.519
You would do this?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.022
For Varro?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.479
I would do it for you, Spartacus,
that you have peace of mind

08:48.654 --> 08:50.485
knowing his family
is attended to.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.156
(sighs)

08:55.327 --> 08:58.660
These sad events
have obviously taken their toll.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.537
Rest,

09:00.708 --> 09:04.496
and be reassured
that those responsible for our pain

09:04.670 --> 09:07.082
will soon drink deep
of their own.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.301
It is regretful
what happened to Varro.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.434
I saw in your eyes
how you craved

09:22.604 --> 09:25.220
to defy order of his death.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.015
A shame
you did not attempt it.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.220
Goat-fuck.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.225
I knew it.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.729
Why do you fucking bleat?
You fight by my side, brother.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.391
Like a suckling babe?
I would prove myself alone.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.608
And die the same.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.037
Our champion
does not look to form.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.166
Mm, the gods punish him.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.076
Agron: For what offense?

10:29.254 --> 10:32.246
Duro: You fucking jest.
Varro's blood, still wet upon his hands.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.506
Agron: His hands were removed
from choice.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.758
I would die before I would kill
my own brother.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.921
And who would see
to your brother's family?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.888
What answer
do you give, Duro?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.313
With both of you dead,
who would see to his wife,

10:54.488 --> 10:55.694
his child?

10:55.864 --> 10:58.480
My brother has
no wife or child.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.740
Wait.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.745
Fucking Thracians.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.104
Apologies.
I called your name.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.614
I did not hear.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.992
You do not appear yourself.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.198
Did Dominus send you?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.455
He would see
your spirits raised.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.037
They do not deserve it.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.167
Spartacus.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.078
Your wound.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.669
It's a scratch.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.333
Varro suffered worse.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.547
I will help you to your cell.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.713
You are not needed.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.635
Apologies.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.805
Mira.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.810
The man I saw you with.

12:18.989 --> 12:22.072
l was ordered
to tend to his needs.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.903
He means nothing to me.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.784
Such is not my concern.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.032
The man was wounded
trying to protect my wife.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.582
Next you lay with him,

12:35.756 --> 12:38.042
lwould have you offer
my gratitude.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.608
Batiatus.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.519
Apologies for the accommodation,
Magistrate.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.404
Take comfort knowing that you
will not have to endure for long.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.736
What is this madness?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.492
Madness?

13:07.663 --> 13:10.325
No. It's only reason

13:10.499 --> 13:13.081
born of a clear mind
and a wounded heart.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.082
Wounded?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.834
l have done you no injury.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.998
The man's crimes escape
his lofty notice.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.837
Release me.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.969
from this fucking world.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.431
Whatever your disagreement,

13:33.605 --> 13:37.598
let us discuss it
as civilized men.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.609
No, you mistake me.
lam but a base animal,

13:40.779 --> 13:43.646
a beast to be ridden
and disregarded.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.280
Batiatus!

13:45.450 --> 13:49.193
You accept my hospitality,
enter my home,

13:49.371 --> 13:51.862
break bread,
drink my wine,

13:52.040 --> 13:55.248
only to spit in my face.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.001
"Leave politics to the men

13:58.171 --> 14:00.287
who have the breeding for it."

14:04.094 --> 14:07.712
Offense was not my intent.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.674
I sought only to spare you
further humiliation.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.059
Spare me?

14:14.229 --> 14:16.470
You don't have the power
to spare shit,

14:16.648 --> 14:18.479
you pathetic cunt!

14:22.362 --> 14:24.068
Now speak the words!

14:24.239 --> 14:25.649
Tell me my heritage.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.314
Tell me my family name
bears no weight

14:27.492 --> 14:29.869
among you
and your noble cock-eaters.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.824
Huh? Speak!

14:32.998 --> 14:34.784
Apologies, Dominus.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.825
Perhaps if you move
your foot...

14:44.509 --> 14:46.215
Lift him up.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.342
Dominus.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.348
( Calavius grunts, coughs)

14:56.855 --> 14:58.937
You wish words from me?

15:00.776 --> 15:02.937
May you listen
to them well.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.693
You are a jest,

15:05.864 --> 15:07.855
a man tolerated

15:08.033 --> 15:09.944
because of his ownership
of Spartacus,

15:10.118 --> 15:13.610
the savior of Capua.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.622
When he falls,

15:16.792 --> 15:18.999
you will quickly follow.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.205
Tied to a fucking chair
in the filth and mire,

15:21.379 --> 15:24.792
and yet the man provokes.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.798
You still do not see it,
do you,

15:27.969 --> 15:31.052
good Batiatus?

15:31.223 --> 15:33.088
You are beneath me

15:33.266 --> 15:35.518
and you always will be,

15:35.685 --> 15:38.062
in this life or the next.

15:38.230 --> 15:42.269
Do what you must
to balm your wounded pride.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.649
lwill not beg.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.602
Beg? No.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.944
The time for begging
is long past.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.985
Plans have been
set in motion

15:55.163 --> 15:56.664
for you

15:56.832 --> 15:59.323
and young Numerius.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.492
What has my boy
to do with it?

16:01.670 --> 16:03.877
He is a man now.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.005
He too has a part to play
in our little drama.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.924
Batiatus, you--

16:15.892 --> 16:18.008
Attend he does not
injure himself.

16:18.186 --> 16:22.270
I would see him fresh
for the appointed time.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.058
Is this wise, Dominus?
Perhaps if we--

16:27.070 --> 16:31.780
Take hold of your cock
and follow the plan, eh?

16:34.911 --> 16:38.074
We are committed.
We are committed.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.909
Dominus.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.124
The games approach.

16:50.302 --> 16:52.133
Prove yourselves
against Pompeii.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.465
Honor the House of Batiatus.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.309
My brother meant nothing
by his remarks.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.394
He spoke his mind.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.402
Thoughts shared by many.

17:10.572 --> 17:13.063
You wish to rest?

17:13.241 --> 17:16.654
If I do, I shall tell you.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.832
Did I hurt you,

17:25.003 --> 17:26.834
Champion?

17:42.437 --> 17:44.473
Tend to the wound.

17:44.648 --> 17:45.979
Spartacus.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.518
Spartacus.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.456
The man is half dead.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.374
You didn't notice
he needed fucking attention?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.053
I thought him only distracted
by Varro's death.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.212
Will he be able to fight
against Pompeii?

18:18.390 --> 18:23.054
He burns with fever.
A miracle if he lives to the games.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.843
Provide a list
of all that is needed.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.602
Ashur heads to market.
He will see it filled.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.139
Let not a moment pass
with him unattended.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.229
Fetch Mira from the villa
if you need assistance.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.065
He has some feelings
towards the girl.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.355
Her touch
may aid recovery.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.899
Our champion cannot fail.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.238
Medicus: Dominus.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.536
The primus against Pompeii
finally mine,

18:47.711 --> 18:50.327
and the gods
jam cock in ass.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.247
The crowd will turn upon me when
they learn Spartacus does not fight.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.541
Perhaps they will be appeased
with suitable replacement.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.085
Who but Spartacus could best
their fucking champion?

18:58.263 --> 18:59.753
There is but one.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.426
The primus?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.931
Mine.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.093
At last Batiatus remembers
my worth

19:06.271 --> 19:07.761
and I shall
take the sand again

19:07.939 --> 19:11.727
and see it turn red
with the blood of Pericles.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.358
Soften your words.
We'll be discovered.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.190
Well, let them hear us.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.276
Tonight I am a god.

19:20.285 --> 19:24.028
And lwill reclaim my title--
champion of Capua.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.412
The news
does not please you.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.953
lt fills my heart with joy
to see you so alive...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.585
and would have you
remain so.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.296
Naevia.

19:38.470 --> 19:42.463
The primus is a fight
to the death, Crixus.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.383
You have been absent the arena
many months.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.142
- lf Pericles were--
- Shh.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.644
He will not.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.601
How can you be certain?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.817
Because I will never
leave your side.

19:56.988 --> 20:00.572
Death itself will tremble
if it tries to part us.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.912
Tomorrow when I take victory,

20:05.080 --> 20:09.494
I will look to you
in the pulvinus.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.455
We will share
the moment alone.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.592
( distant dogs barking )

20:35.693 --> 20:38.560
Your hand is weighted.
Now float your tongue.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.776
You are safe.

20:42.951 --> 20:46.535
My master has greater concerns
requiring his attentions.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.366
What plagues good Batiatus
to such distraction?

20:49.541 --> 20:51.782
Matters beyond your worries.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.451
Yet they clearly trouble you.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.462
Conﬁde.
Lift your burden.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.543
He has grown reckless.

20:59.717 --> 21:03.335
His thirst for power and vengeance
clouds judgment.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.720
How so?

21:05.890 --> 21:09.553
l have taken too great a risk
meeting with you this night.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.389
I must to the apothecary
before I'm overdue.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.600
One day very soon

21:14.774 --> 21:17.356
the House of Batiatus
will come crashing down.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.189
Do not find yourself
buried in the rubble.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.485
(shivering )

21:34.586 --> 21:37.077
- ( coughing)
- Hold him down.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.758
That's right.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.927
Easy.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.196
(grunts)

22:02.363 --> 22:04.445
Crixus:
Well, lick my hole.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.902
The pig fucker's still alive.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.034
(laughing)

22:14.292 --> 22:16.704
( exclaims )

22:35.813 --> 22:38.680
This is what you are to him--

22:38.858 --> 22:43.318
gold, mined from
blood and meat.

23:05.343 --> 23:08.835
Woman:
All hail Spartacus...

23:15.019 --> 23:17.510
slayer of the Shadow...

23:21.901 --> 23:25.268
bringer of the rain...

23:26.406 --> 23:29.318
champion of the Romans.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.470
(screaming )

24:09.198 --> 24:09.277
( crowd cheering )

24:09.282 --> 24:11.568
( crowd cheering )

24:27.216 --> 24:29.172
( chuckles )

24:29.344 --> 24:31.084
( Duro screaming )

24:34.098 --> 24:35.929
Die!

24:45.068 --> 24:46.433
Fuck.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.647
( Batiatus guffaws )

24:50.156 --> 24:52.613
Is that the best
the great Pompeii has to offer?

24:52.784 --> 24:56.652
I fear the games will be
a disappointment this year.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.115
These early skirmishes
count for nothing.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.451
It is the primus
that decides the victor.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.912
Absent your man Spartacus,

25:04.087 --> 25:07.079
Capua shall once again find itself
in Pompeii's shadow.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.123
Perhaps Crixus will bring light
to the matter.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.793
Pompeii man: Crixus, yes.
The crowd will be amazed

25:13.971 --> 25:15.962
that the Gaul is still alive.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.927
Batiatus assures us
he's recovered from his injuries.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.764
Numerius: That he survived at all
is impressive.

25:21.938 --> 25:25.430
No gladiator from Pompeii
ever lived against Theokoles.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.815
Young Numerius
cuts to the truth.

25:27.985 --> 25:31.148
A talent he learned
from his father.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.813
Does good Calavius intend to grace us
with his presence?

25:33.991 --> 25:35.777
The day grows short.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.943
Critical matters of trade
in Picentia.

25:38.121 --> 25:40.954
He must have been delayed
upon his return.

25:41.124 --> 25:44.116
I am certain
he will join us presently.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.055
Aulus.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.350
Up, you fucking goat.

26:10.528 --> 26:14.146
Dominus does not pay you
to dream of tits and cunts.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.190
Place foot on me again
and find yourself once more a cripple.

26:17.368 --> 26:20.986
You know the stakes we deal.
If Calavius were to escape--

26:21.164 --> 26:22.700
Fuck your mouth shut.

26:22.874 --> 26:25.206
The man has not stirred.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.300
Nor does he breathe.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.046
Batiatus commanded

26:40.224 --> 26:43.512
he not expire
until the appointed hour.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.768
He's still alive,
you fucking woman.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.849
Raise yourself, peacock.

26:51.903 --> 26:53.564
Shit.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.150
This is on you.
I will share no--

26:56.324 --> 26:57.860
Quiet.

27:00.411 --> 27:03.528
He breathes.
The man is still alive.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.742
(screaming )

27:05.917 --> 27:07.908
Aulus.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.080
lwill have you both crucified,
and your master.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.459
Aulus, enough.

27:19.514 --> 27:21.004
Aulus.

27:21.182 --> 27:24.424
Let me see.
Let me see.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.229
Ugly as a whore's gash,
but you will live.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.982
Return to the ludus
and have Medicus attend to it.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.108
Do you have the balls
to see this through alone?

27:38.282 --> 27:40.568
Two of them, very large.

27:40.743 --> 27:41.949
Go.

27:55.967 --> 27:58.800
Man:
How long must we wait?

27:58.970 --> 28:00.585
Yeah!

28:00.763 --> 28:03.254
Woman:
Bring on Pompeii!

28:04.725 --> 28:07.137
We wait an eternity.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.393
Why don't I begin
the primus?

28:19.073 --> 28:23.066
The crowd threatens riot.
We can await Calavius no longer.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.111
Good Batiatus,

28:26.289 --> 28:29.281
would you present the primus
on my husband's behalf?

28:29.458 --> 28:32.165
- Well, if you think it proper.
- Please.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.917
( crowd booing )

28:34.088 --> 28:35.828
Man: Where is the fucking
magistrate?

28:36.007 --> 28:38.089
Woman:
We want some action!

28:39.093 --> 28:41.334
Capua!

28:46.392 --> 28:49.475
In honor of
Magistrate Calavius,

28:49.645 --> 28:51.476
who is absent

28:51.647 --> 28:54.354
attending vital business
on your behalf,

28:54.525 --> 28:57.562
I present the primus
against Pompeii.

28:57.737 --> 29:01.525
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

29:05.411 --> 29:07.276
Yes.

29:07.455 --> 29:11.949
Yes, we all desire
to see Spartacus take to the sands.

29:12.126 --> 29:14.333
But sadly

29:14.503 --> 29:17.666
this day shall not see him
with sword in hand.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.673
( booing )

29:20.843 --> 29:25.177
Yet there is cause to rejoice.

29:25.348 --> 29:28.465
This is a glorious moment,

29:28.643 --> 29:30.929
much anticipated,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.810
for it marks the return
to the arena

29:33.981 --> 29:36.643
of one of Capua's
favored sons--

29:38.653 --> 29:42.191
Crixus murmillo!

29:42.365 --> 29:44.356
( crowd booing )

29:54.001 --> 29:58.836
They have forgotten the honor
that l have brought them.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.122
Then it is time
you reminded them

30:01.300 --> 30:03.916
who their true champion is.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.521
It appears Capua does not care
for your selection.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.691
(giggles)

30:27.868 --> 30:31.110
Batiatus: He faces
a most vile opponent

30:31.288 --> 30:35.452
belched from the bowels
of Pompeii.

30:38.129 --> 30:40.996
I give you Pericles

30:41.173 --> 30:42.629
Th raex!

30:52.727 --> 30:55.810
Yes! Pericles!

31:08.492 --> 31:11.984
I pray the match is
overly brief.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.582
I would see
his fat smirk removed.

31:18.753 --> 31:21.165
Give the command.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.340
Begin!

32:22.441 --> 32:23.897
Oh.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.772
What was
the fucking cause?

32:27.947 --> 32:31.110
A dog,
soon to be put down.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.906
Drink.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.413
Smells like piss.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.869
lt's henbane.
It's to make you rest.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.499
I need food
and a few hours' sleep.

32:50.678 --> 32:53.169
Come for me
if his condition changes.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.362
( chuckles )

33:20.541 --> 33:23.374
Pompeii!

33:26.172 --> 33:29.005
Another year,
another favored son of Capua

33:29.175 --> 33:30.881
gone to grass.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.632
Batiatus: The match
is not yet concluded.

33:32.803 --> 33:36.341
Man: Formalities of blood.
Your man is finished.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.006
Crixus has
the heart of a lion.

33:39.185 --> 33:42.598
Man in crowd:
Fuck you, Crixus.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.308
Oh, he wants some more.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.394
Look, he yet rises.

33:48.569 --> 33:49.775
Oh.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.901
Lucretia.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.779
- Domina.
- Give her water.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.157
Your wife does not fare well
at the sight of your man

33:57.328 --> 34:00.491
about to be slaughtered.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.827
Apologies.
It's the heat.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.162
See her back to the villa.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.168
It will pass.

34:08.339 --> 34:12.173
No arguments.
I will join you afterwards.

34:12.343 --> 34:14.129
Dominus.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.855
Pericles: Crixus!

34:30.361 --> 34:31.942
(yells)

35:40.764 --> 35:43.426
( crowd cheering )

35:44.518 --> 35:48.227
( crowd chanting )
Kill! Kill! Kill!

35:48.397 --> 35:52.015
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

36:21.722 --> 36:24.589
Crixus! Crixus! Crixus! Crixus!

36:26.060 --> 36:29.473
(yells)

36:29.646 --> 36:31.307
Crixus,

36:31.482 --> 36:35.600
returned to form
as promised.

36:35.778 --> 36:38.645
Your prayers have been answered.
The match was overly brief.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.938
(laughing)

36:41.950 --> 36:43.906
Good fortune to Capua

36:44.078 --> 36:46.034
- and all its deserving citizens.
- Crixus: Capua!

36:46.205 --> 36:48.867
- Oh, linger a moment.
- Crixus: Have your blood!

36:49.041 --> 36:53.159
Let us have a drink
and relive this glorious day.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.669
Dominus.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.957
What news so important
it interrupts

37:00.135 --> 37:01.671
the gloating
of good Batiatus?

37:01.845 --> 37:05.429
The magistrate's caravan has been
discovered on the edge of town,

37:05.599 --> 37:07.510
his guards murdered.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.595
What of my father?

37:09.770 --> 37:11.476
He was not among them,
but there are tracks

37:11.647 --> 37:14.013
- leading back to the city.
- Back to Capua?

37:14.191 --> 37:16.147
Why would anyone commit
such treachery?

37:16.318 --> 37:17.933
Ransom.

37:18.112 --> 37:20.194
This burden saddens me.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.150
lfl may be
of any assistance...

37:22.324 --> 37:24.030
Gratitude.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.737
We can handle it.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.410
I will gather my men
to aid in the search.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.120
Numerius, your presence
is welcome.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.706
- No, I will have him by my side.
- Mother.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.043
I will never let him out of my sight.
You have my oath on it.

37:40.217 --> 37:43.129
- Okay.
- Come, let us to your father.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.769
You send message,
yet I wait as a common slave?

38:01.947 --> 38:04.188
Apologies. It was difficult
to move without notice.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.778
The alarm is up across the city.
Speak quickly.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.910
ljoin the search for good Calavius.
He's gone missing.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.786
I am aware
of his absence--

38:11.957 --> 38:15.040
the very matter
I wish to broach.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.176
- Calavius's ring.
- Shh. Softly. Softly.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.834
How did you come by this?

38:26.013 --> 38:28.846
Through means
pressing upon your desires.

38:29.016 --> 38:33.100
Batiatus holds him captive
with intent of murder.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.761
Madness, even for Batiatus.

38:35.939 --> 38:39.056
Magistrate Calavius insults him,
obstructs his ambitions.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.976
I've never seen Batiatus
so unhinged.

38:42.154 --> 38:45.612
I would sever bonds lest | find myself
upon the cross beside him.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.444
Calavius yet lives?

38:48.619 --> 38:50.610
For the briefest of moments.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.573
Where is he held?

38:52.748 --> 38:56.206
Oh, you speak of severing bonds
but remain firmly tethered.

38:56.376 --> 39:00.119
I hold no love for old loyalties,
yet Calavius has seen my face.

39:00.297 --> 39:04.791
I must flee the city
and would have proper means to do so.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.345
Take it,
and more when Batiatus

39:07.513 --> 39:10.050
and his treachery are laid to rest.
Come, we must gather men.

39:10.224 --> 39:12.306
Calavius would be dead
before you do.

39:12.476 --> 39:15.593
Batiatus already moves
towards his plan.

39:15.771 --> 39:18.513
- Are you armed?
- A simple dagger.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.976
Enough to cut ropes.

39:21.151 --> 39:23.608
Quickly,
or see opportunity fade.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.788
( gasps )

39:54.851 --> 39:56.842
( groans )

40:00.566 --> 40:02.557
Medicus.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.646
Mira.

40:37.728 --> 40:40.515
( deep breathing )

41:20.687 --> 41:23.099
Sura:
Why did you kill him?

41:28.153 --> 41:30.940
I had no choice.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.116
A man must accept
his fate.

41:47.381 --> 41:50.123
Or be destroyed by it.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.677
Is this my path--

41:52.844 --> 41:54.709
blood and death?

41:54.888 --> 41:57.345
You have always been destined

41:57.516 --> 41:59.848
for unfortunate things.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.816
Please.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.117
Don't leave me again.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.366
It was you.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.153
It was you who left.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.456
(thunder crashing )

42:25.627 --> 42:29.040
You must tend
to the wound.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.180
(groaning)

42:54.781 --> 42:58.069
Attacked...

42:59.536 --> 43:01.618
on the road.

43:03.373 --> 43:06.035
Came out of nowhere.

43:23.351 --> 43:26.514
Tend to the wound.

43:36.907 --> 43:40.365
I'm here. I'm here.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.368
Be still.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.699
Shh.

43:47.918 --> 43:50.250
Your fever's broken.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.126
The gods
have blessed you.

43:59.262 --> 44:02.254
Yes.

44:02.432 --> 44:04.093
They have.

44:12.192 --> 44:13.932
I will fetch Medicus.

44:14.110 --> 44:15.941
Wait.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.979
Release the straps.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.773
I would speak
to this man alone.

44:21.952 --> 44:23.658
Towards what purpose?

44:23.829 --> 44:27.742
Wait in the corridor.
Sound warning if anyone approaches.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.456
Do this for me, Mira.

44:37.259 --> 44:39.625
And I will be in your debt.

44:46.768 --> 44:50.306
There is no sign of him.
My father could be held anywhere.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.688
He is a man of much esteem
and easily recognized.

44:53.859 --> 44:56.601
How could he be moved
through the streets without notice?

44:56.778 --> 44:59.269
I do not know.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.654
Think.
There must be a way.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.321
The cisterns--

45:09.499 --> 45:11.455
they run beneath the city
and beyond.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.241
The gates. Torches.

45:13.420 --> 45:15.331
You will be with your father
soon enough, Numerius.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.211
You have my word.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.498
Your part in this
shall not be forgotten.

45:19.676 --> 45:21.837
No, it shall not.

45:27.976 --> 45:29.591
- ( men shouting in distance)
- Calavius.

45:29.769 --> 45:31.305
Wait. They approach.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.686
- We must hurry.
- No, it is too late.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.188
Steel your fucking nerve.

45:35.358 --> 45:37.974
lwill not end murdered
by you or any man.

45:38.153 --> 45:41.645
Consider Ashur a spirit
and Capua the world he left behind.

45:41.823 --> 45:43.529
Ashur.

45:46.620 --> 45:49.532
They're upon us.
We must get you free.

46:12.562 --> 46:14.974
Numerius: Solonius.

46:17.359 --> 46:19.691
Solonius: No. No.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.529
Seize him.

46:34.751 --> 46:37.914
Your father
shall be avenged.

46:38.088 --> 46:41.376
Solonius will suffer
for what he has done.

46:44.094 --> 46:46.130
(screaming )

46:47.555 --> 46:52.140
And all of Capua will know you
for the shit you are.

46:57.691 --> 47:00.433
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

47:03.238 --> 47:06.355
Tell me what happened. Tell!

47:06.533 --> 47:09.491
Take your hands off me.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.994
My wife Sura,

47:13.164 --> 47:15.906
the slave you were transporting
from Neapolis--

47:16.084 --> 47:18.951
tell me what happened
to her.

47:20.005 --> 47:22.838
We were attacked
on the road.

47:24.884 --> 47:27.796
Theytﬁed
to get to her but--

47:29.139 --> 47:30.629
Where is your wound?

47:30.807 --> 47:34.720
Where is the wound you earned
trying to save my wife?

47:36.062 --> 47:37.723
Guard!

47:39.315 --> 47:41.772
Tell me. Tell me.

47:44.279 --> 47:48.067
| only did
as commanded.

47:49.325 --> 47:51.941
Who spoke the words
that took her life?

47:55.915 --> 47:58.531
Who?

48:00.170 --> 48:02.081
Batiatus.

48:21.191 --> 48:22.852
What have you done?

48:24.527 --> 48:26.734
Help me restore him.

48:28.531 --> 48:33.525
You will secure my straps

48:33.703 --> 48:37.867
and never speak of this.

48:42.962 --> 48:44.748
Ashur: The wound
did not appear fatal.

48:47.383 --> 48:50.045
The damage was deeper
than the eye could perceive.

48:50.220 --> 48:52.506
Medicus tells
he drowned in his own blood.

48:52.680 --> 48:57.174
A loose end
no longer needing to be tied.

48:59.354 --> 49:01.891
( laughs ) You've played
your part well, Ashur.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.021
It was a greater hand than mine
that conceived it.

49:04.192 --> 49:06.478
Solonius was easily deceived into
believing you would betray me,

49:06.653 --> 49:07.859
as I knew he would.

49:08.029 --> 49:10.145
He never suspected
my loyalty always lay with you.

49:10.323 --> 49:12.905
A man who has no honor cannot
imagine that trait in anyone else.

49:13.076 --> 49:15.818
And you-- you have that quality
above all others

49:15.995 --> 49:17.735
and shall be rewarded
in kind.

49:17.914 --> 49:19.620
Your will, Dominus.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.622
( laughs)

49:21.793 --> 49:23.499
The gods truly favor
the House of Batiatus.

49:23.670 --> 49:27.208
Behold Spartacus
risen from the dead.

49:27.382 --> 49:28.838
Spartacus!

49:32.595 --> 49:34.927
You are well?

49:37.559 --> 49:39.891
Yes, Dominus.

49:40.061 --> 49:42.393
I am myself again.

49:47.485 --> 49:47.519
(theme music playing )

49:47.527 --> 49:49.813
(theme music playing )
