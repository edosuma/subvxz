00:03.140 --> 00:05.020
I don't want to go!

00:07.020 --> 00:09.100
Just go home. You know the way.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.940
I don't want to go!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.420
You'll be fine. Trust me, just go.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.060
You're too young to come, Jesse.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.980
You won't even like it.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.580
Mark!

00:22.380 --> 00:23.820
Just go!

00:29.620 --> 00:31.380
We'll see you later!

00:50.340 --> 00:52.340
Come on, Mark.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.060
Dad, my pocket money!

01:43.220 --> 01:45.540
Money, money, money.
That's all you think about.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.220
I thought you might like this.

01:48.180 --> 01:51.140
Thanks. I'm good, but thanks.
Sit down.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.660
Stop it!

01:55.180 --> 01:57.380
Move your head!

01:57.580 --> 01:58.420
Yes.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.820
Come on!

03:15.780 --> 03:18.140
- Morning.
- What have we got?

03:18.900 --> 03:21.180
The dead woman's bag was found
in the hotel room.

03:21.340 --> 03:23.860
But no wallet and no phone, so no ID.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.900
Didn't she check in?

03:26.060 --> 03:28.660
It was checked in under
the name of Ben Jackinov.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.700
I think it's fair to say
that's a pseudonym.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.300
- Jesus.
- Potential murder weapon?

03:33.460 --> 03:35.340
All right, I'll check that in a bit.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.380
Got a description of the man?

03:37.540 --> 03:38.940
Fairly general.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.380
How was it paid for? Didn't the
hotel take a credit card swipe?

03:42.540 --> 03:45.740
Cash, and there's only CCTV
on the outside of the building.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.500
But the manager did offer us
something useful.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.300
He recalls the woman going outside
to take a mobile phone call.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.380
It's timecoded so we can trace it.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.460
Without knowing what network
she's on, how long will it take?

03:58.620 --> 04:00.620
Right now, it's all I've got.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.020
All right, put in a comms request
to all the main providers.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.740
I want a name and address
as soon as possible.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.100
If you want my opinion,
from the blood on the back of the door,

04:11.260 --> 04:14.060
the attack started when
she came out of the bathroom.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.100
Ally, you be the victim.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.820
- Why me?
- Because you're...

04:18.980 --> 04:20.820
All right, you be the victim.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.700
Get in touch with your female side.

04:23.580 --> 04:26.140
So she was probably
having a leak in the bathroom.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.420
You don't have to do that part.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.740
When she comes out...

04:37.180 --> 04:38.940
She gets a blow
to the back of the head.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.420
- <i>Wallop!</i>
- Agh!

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
Now, it's bad
but it doesn't kill her.

04:44.060 --> 04:45.300
She goes down on the bed.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.340
She's probably out cold when
the attacker comes at her again.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.020
Wallop!

04:52.180 --> 04:53.540
Wallop!

04:53.700 --> 04:55.220
Are you enjoying this?

04:56.620 --> 04:58.860
The attacker's covered in blood.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.140
From the traces
we found in the bathroom,

05:01.300 --> 05:05.020
I reckon he took time to wash before
making his, or her - equality -

05:05.180 --> 05:06.140
exit.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.260
Where are you going? I've just
bludgeoned you to death.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.220
Mark!

05:52.500 --> 05:53.900
Happy birthday.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.260
I was just out for a run
so I thought I'd...

05:56.420 --> 05:58.420
I thought I'd come and surprise you.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.540
- Right.
- Life lesson there, isn't there?

06:01.700 --> 06:03.820
You should never turn up
unannounced.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.060
I saw him leave.

06:16.180 --> 06:18.820
So what was Kenton doing here?
Did he stay the night?

06:24.060 --> 06:26.060
Laura, can you talk to me, please?

06:27.660 --> 06:29.500
Is there any point lying?

06:33.500 --> 06:34.980
Why would you do that? That's...

06:35.140 --> 06:36.900
He's my husband.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.580
You said it was over.

06:38.740 --> 06:40.780
- Yeah, it was.
- Was?

06:41.620 --> 06:43.460
Past tense. Wow!

06:43.620 --> 06:44.860
Oh, my God.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.980
Who cheats on their lover
with their husband?

06:50.140 --> 06:51.500
I have to go to work.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.460
Is that all you've got to say?

06:54.620 --> 06:57.220
- Do you want me to lose my job?
- No, I don't.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.060
I just want you to tell me the last
few months meant something to you.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.980
You said it was over between
you two, that it had finished.

07:04.140 --> 07:06.900
You told me you wanted
something different.

07:11.820 --> 07:13.180
OK.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.180
- Nice arse, Britney.
- Britnay.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.700
"Nice arse, Britnay."

08:05.020 --> 08:06.060
Hey, Brit!

08:20.220 --> 08:22.220
Psychopath, then, is it?

08:23.300 --> 08:27.140
Bludgeoned to death with a hammer -
we can rule out manslaughter.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.100
Shame, really. She was quite hot.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.659
Yeah, that makes it so much worse.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.020
Forensics report from Ken.

08:36.179 --> 08:39.299
With the DNA results from
the plaster found at the scene.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.419
The ones I asked for
half an hour ago?

08:41.580 --> 08:43.940
We were training, Danny.
That shit's sacrosanct.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.420
Yeah, well, as long as
your abs are ripped.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.620
Don't wish for it, my friend -
work for it.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.420
- Whoa!
- You all right?

09:58.580 --> 10:00.460
- All right, mate.
- You all right?

10:00.620 --> 10:02.620
Happy birthday, bud.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.580
I got you a gift.
But it's still in the shop.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.140
Man, that's perfect,
cause I can just collect it

10:08.300 --> 10:09.900
when I don't get yours next month.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.700
Thank you very much. No Laura?

10:14.300 --> 10:17.660
No, she had a work's dinner,
couldn't shift things around.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.940
Couldn't shift things around?

10:20.100 --> 10:23.580
I'm not six, Slade.
We only do this for my mum.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.300
Have you heard from Danny?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.380
- No, has he not called?
- Mm-mn.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.580
Maybe he couldn't
shift things around.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.340
Hello, I'd just like to say a few
words.

10:38.500 --> 10:42.500
You know, it's a sobering moment for
a father when you look at your son -

10:43.220 --> 10:44.740
your baby - and you realise...

10:44.900 --> 10:48.260
that he's reached the age where he
can no longer call himself young.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.940
If he's becoming an old fart,
what does that make me?

10:52.100 --> 10:53.940
- A grave dodger!
- Oi!

10:54.580 --> 10:57.660
So I'd like you all, please,
to raise a glass.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.540
Ignore his crow's feet
and his receding hairline.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.060
- Thanks, mate.
- And wish a happy birthday...

11:03.220 --> 11:04.500
to my little boy.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.460
To Mark.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.940
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!

11:11.100 --> 11:12.900
Sorry, sorry. Um...

11:13.060 --> 11:15.060
I wanted to say something too.

11:15.740 --> 11:19.060
As you all know, we've had
some difficult times in the past.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.420
I have two sons...

11:23.100 --> 11:24.380
Mark...

11:26.460 --> 11:28.420
- And Jesse.
- Hey, Mum.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.220
But only one of them who's here
every year on his birthday.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.900
All right, Julie.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.460
Happy birthday, son.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.460
Happy birthday! Come on!

11:46.620 --> 11:47.900
- Happy birthday.
- Cheers.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.980
Sorry.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.980
Don't be sorry.

11:53.140 --> 11:53.980
You OK?

11:55.180 --> 11:57.700
- I love you.
- I love you too.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.380
I'm just gonna go and see Danny.
Two secs.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.980
Hiya, mate, you OK?

12:11.140 --> 12:13.420
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right, mate.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.060
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.260
All right, pal. What is it?

12:20.300 --> 12:21.900
There's a...

12:22.860 --> 12:25.500
There's a case that I'm working on,
it's a murder.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.460
We found something at the scene.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.900
What?

12:32.060 --> 12:34.580
Blood, but it's not the victim's.
We um...

12:36.020 --> 12:38.780
We ran some DNA tests
and there's a match.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.100
Mark, it's Jesse.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.260
The DNA, it's Jesse.

12:53.580 --> 12:55.060
He's alive.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.580
So you're saying he's a murderer?

12:59.740 --> 13:01.660
No, nobody's saying anything.

13:01.820 --> 13:04.260
20 years. 20 years! What the hell?

13:04.420 --> 13:05.780
I don't know. Nobody knows.

13:05.940 --> 13:09.140
What... So his DNA's
at a murder scene and...

13:10.540 --> 13:13.220
he's not the victim,
so what does that leave?

13:13.380 --> 13:15.860
He's a witness or just someone
that happens to be there?

13:16.020 --> 13:19.020
I'm gonna double-check the results,
triple-check them, OK?

13:19.180 --> 13:21.180
There's a possibility the DNA's old.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.580
20 years.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.620
I'm saying it's possible.
He may not have been there.

13:25.780 --> 13:28.100
Mark, think about this. Jesse.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.700
- I know.
- It means he's alive.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.700
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I know, I know.

13:34.860 --> 13:38.340
Is what we've always wanted, right?

13:39.300 --> 13:41.500
Oh, man, it doesn't make
any sense to me.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.740
What am I gonna tell my mum, my dad?

13:45.900 --> 13:47.780
Nothing. Not yet, OK?

13:47.940 --> 13:51.060
I shouldn't even be talking
to you guys. I could get fired.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.140
- Yeah.
- OK?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.180
Sorry.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.540
This thing could end up going public.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.020
It's the sort of thing
the papers'll be all over.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.940
If it comes to that,
we'll let them know.

14:08.100 --> 14:11.140
Don't you think there's
someone else we should tell?

14:12.740 --> 14:14.940
Someone who was with us that day.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.780
- Pru?
- Yeah, Pru.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.300
Come on.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.580
Dad, I want to ask you something.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.340
Do you remember him?

14:51.860 --> 14:53.620
This is Jesse, Dad.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.220
You remember he went missing
as a young boy?

15:00.420 --> 15:03.100
It's a case you worked on
when you were a copper.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.780
Jesse, Alan's boy.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.740
He's back, Dad.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.060
Jesse's come back.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.660
Leave her alone!

15:37.740 --> 15:39.100
Dad?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.140
Look at him.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.300
- Take his face away, please.
- He didn't do it.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.820
- He admitted to it.
- And you believed that?

16:15.380 --> 16:17.420
Dad, I know he wrote you letters.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.700
I destroyed them.
They gave me the creeps.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.180
- All of them?
- Yes.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.100
What about Mum? Did she keep any?

16:23.260 --> 16:25.220
You'll have to ask her.
What is all this, Mark?

16:25.380 --> 16:28.140
It was 20 years ago. Why are you
churning all this up again?

16:28.300 --> 16:32.460
Here we are. One chicken curry
and one lamb tagine, sir.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.220
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy your meals.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.300
Disgusted or not,
you must've read them.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.660
- Yes, of course I read them.
- And?

16:39.820 --> 16:42.260
- Well, he wanted us to meet him.
- Uh-huh.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.940
He wanted us to talk.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.620
But of course,
we wouldn't entertain the idea.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.300
- Why not?
- Because he killed your brother.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.300
He admitted it but
there was never any evidence.

16:51.460 --> 16:54.620
Come on, he was seen in the area
the night Jesse went missing.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.700
He killed four other children.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.980
His other victims were older,
a different MO.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.100
He admitted it.

17:00.260 --> 17:02.780
Why does everyone keep talking
like he'll turn up one day?

17:02.940 --> 17:05.339
Your mother - why do you think
we don't live together anymore?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.140
Because she can't move on.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.740
He is dead, Mark. Jesse is dead.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.060
And this is?

17:22.220 --> 17:25.380
We have to do 100,
every hour on the hour.

17:26.859 --> 17:29.100
I need you to double-check
these forensic results.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.860
Why, what's the problem?

17:31.020 --> 17:32.860
The problem is
they don't make any sense.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.620
Can you stop that?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.860
We've had a DNA hit
from the MISPER database,

17:38.020 --> 17:40.180
from a kid that went missing
in 1995.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.700
- What?
- Yeah.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.740
How about you stop impressing your
boyfriend and check them again?

17:49.980 --> 17:53.180
- Is that Pru?
- Yep, under her married name.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.740
- Ooh, Pru Carew.
- Yeah, that's unfortunate.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.420
To think she could have been
Mrs Mark Wells,

17:59.580 --> 18:01.980
married to a hotshot lawyer.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.060
And we're back in the playground.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.340
No, look, now, see she is back.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.740
She's working at
the Windsor Lockwood Clinic.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.820
Why would she come back
without telling us?

18:10.980 --> 18:12.740
To unravel
the mysteries of female logic,

18:12.900 --> 18:14.780
we're gonna need stronger drinks.

18:14.940 --> 18:16.260
The question is,

18:16.420 --> 18:18.380
knowing what we know about Jesse...

18:19.620 --> 18:21.100
do you want to see her?

18:22.700 --> 18:24.580
- Yeah, I guess.
- Good.

18:24.740 --> 18:27.420
I messaged her.
She said tomorrow's fine.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.860
Danny!

18:50.700 --> 18:52.940
- Slade.
- Hi, darling.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.940
- Hey, Pru.
- Mark.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.500
Hi.

18:57.660 --> 18:58.980
Pru.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.980
So amazing to see you all again.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.860
God, how long's it been?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.780
- 16 years.
- It can't be.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.540
You're looking great, really.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.740
So are you.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.500
- I know I am.
- Not a day older.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.580
Apart from your greys.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.860
What?

19:21.900 --> 19:23.020
Wow.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.300
That's big news.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.740
Are you OK?

19:31.460 --> 19:33.580
Oh, I'm fine, yeah.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.780
You know, it's a shock.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.140
A hell of a shock.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.180
We're working to find out more.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.220
Danny felt... We all felt...

19:42.380 --> 19:46.500
that seeing as you were there
that day, you had a right to know.

19:47.860 --> 19:50.020
I've thought about him a lot.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.620
Every year on that day.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.780
I always remember the date,
every year.

19:57.980 --> 20:00.980
So... when did you get back
from the States?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.340
Two years ago.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.980
Two years?

20:09.140 --> 20:11.580
I know, I know,
I should've contacted you all.

20:11.740 --> 20:15.020
But... you know how it is,
it's just work and...

20:15.380 --> 20:18.180
I married an American.
Stuart's a workaholic.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.420
And, well,
I've got a little girl now.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.900
Nico, she's nearly six.

20:24.060 --> 20:26.700
She's cute. I've got three myself,
which is at least one too many.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.980
I kept meaning to,
I kept putting it off.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.860
Then one month turned into six.

20:32.020 --> 20:34.500
- I don't know.
- You don't need to explain to us.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.980
We're big boys, aren't we?

20:37.140 --> 20:38.660
But here we are.

20:39.700 --> 20:40.980
What's happened?

20:41.140 --> 20:43.420
The four of us... grown up!

20:43.580 --> 20:44.420
Yeah.

20:44.580 --> 20:47.300
And Slade running a shelter.
How did that happen?

20:47.460 --> 20:48.820
Says the doctor!

20:48.980 --> 20:51.100
Private doctor, actually, so...

20:51.260 --> 20:53.180
My socialism's gone out the window.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.220
Blame the Americans.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.220
Well, assuage your conscience.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.300
Come and visit.

20:59.460 --> 21:02.900
See how we do things.
I might enlist your services.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.220
I'd like that.

21:05.620 --> 21:06.460
Good.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.180
- We should all keep in touch.
- Definitely.

21:10.340 --> 21:11.580
Yeah?

21:19.140 --> 21:21.580
Mark, give me more attention!

21:22.620 --> 21:24.260
Mark!

21:35.420 --> 21:36.660
Mark!

22:06.580 --> 22:07.700
Hey, Mark.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.380
I want to go and see Marosi.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.020
Are you out of your mind?

22:11.180 --> 22:13.100
I want to look him in the eye

22:13.260 --> 22:15.780
and I just want to ask him
some questions.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.820
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.820
He said that he killed Jesse.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.980
<i>So I just want to meet him.</i>

22:23.660 --> 22:25.580
Danny,
are you gonna help me out?

22:25.740 --> 22:27.700
Or am I gonna have to
sort this myself?

23:20.340 --> 23:22.340
Hello, Mr Wells.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.660
I want you to talk about my brother.

23:25.820 --> 23:26.980
I killed him.

23:28.380 --> 23:31.140
I chose him,
I took him and I killed him.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.220
Three acts. Simple.

23:33.380 --> 23:34.820
I don't believe you.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.540
They found the bodies of
the other four boys you killed,

23:37.700 --> 23:38.860
but not my brother.

23:39.020 --> 23:40.580
Why not?

23:40.740 --> 23:42.260
I burnt it.

23:46.140 --> 23:48.340
And why would you do that?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.460
Because he was younger.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.660
And what I did to him...

23:54.060 --> 23:55.620
was disgusting.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.500
I like young boys.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.300
And I liked Jesse...

24:05.820 --> 24:07.340
A lot.

24:13.140 --> 24:16.140
You're already facing life
for the other four boys you killed.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.580
So you took the rap for Jesse

24:20.740 --> 24:24.100
in order to secure yourself
privileges in prison.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.860
Didn't you?

24:29.460 --> 24:32.140
Get yourself back
on the front pages.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.500
He was crying.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.540
Very, very upset.

24:43.060 --> 24:46.300
He wanted to go home to his mummy.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.940
And I wanted to send him home.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.700
But I knew I couldn't.

24:55.220 --> 24:58.020
Then I told him I would take him.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.500
I put him in my car, started driving.

25:06.060 --> 25:07.940
He kind of cheered up.

25:15.260 --> 25:18.900
But of course,
I wasn't taking him home.

25:19.340 --> 25:22.500
I was taking him... somewhere else.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.220
You're lying.

25:24.380 --> 25:25.340
Am I?

25:28.020 --> 25:30.500
Who else is lying about that day,
Mark?

25:30.660 --> 25:32.540
Are you, are your friends?

25:40.100 --> 25:43.060
Jesse was crying when I found him.

25:45.820 --> 25:48.660
Who made him cry, huh?

25:51.500 --> 25:56.180
The DNA tie-in with the missing kid
is potentially huge.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.260
For now, this cannot get out.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.700
We dig away until we know exactly
what we're dealing with, OK?

26:01.860 --> 26:04.260
I don't want journalists
banging on my door.

26:04.420 --> 26:05.340
Danny.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.180
Thanks.

26:08.460 --> 26:10.980
The murder victim is yet to be ID'd,

26:11.140 --> 26:13.420
but we are tracing her mobile
as whoever killed her

26:13.580 --> 26:15.740
might have taken it with him.

26:15.900 --> 26:16.860
Next.

26:17.020 --> 26:19.740
Now, given the reputation
of the murder location

26:19.900 --> 26:21.780
and the manner of her dress,

26:21.940 --> 26:26.020
we're working on the possibility
she was accepting payment for sex.

26:26.180 --> 26:30.100
So it could be a disgruntled client,
a partner of someone.

26:30.260 --> 26:33.380
Or drug related. Every hooker
I've encountered was an addict.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.620
We all know how many hookers
Mickey's encountered.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.940
OK, yeah, very funny.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.420
As to the DNA findings...

26:43.580 --> 26:45.500
Didn't you know this kid?

26:46.780 --> 26:48.580
Weren't you there that day?

26:51.300 --> 26:53.420
He was the brother
of a friend of mine.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.940
I don't intend to let that
cloud my judgment.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.380
I'm gonna deal with this case
like I deal with any other -

26:58.540 --> 26:59.500
professionally.

27:02.660 --> 27:03.860
All right.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.620
The murder weapon.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.500
Daddy!

27:50.860 --> 27:53.060
- Mark.
- Hi. I need to tell you something.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.460
Right now?

27:55.620 --> 27:58.660
No, Mum, tomorrow night.
Now, of course now.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.300
And this is?

28:04.940 --> 28:07.020
We were married for 23 years, Mark.

28:08.860 --> 28:10.900
You both need to hear this.

28:12.620 --> 28:14.500
I told you, didn't I?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.540
I told you I knew he was alive.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.980
It's a mistake. It's a mistake.

28:19.140 --> 28:20.540
It's been checked. It's DNA.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.620
- It's a mistake!
- Alan.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.300
Accept it.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.300
What, accept that he's alive?

28:26.460 --> 28:28.620
Give myself that hope
only to have it dragged away?

28:28.780 --> 28:30.700
We're gonna get our boy back.

28:30.860 --> 28:35.660
I would give anything... anything
to put my arms around my son again.

28:37.060 --> 28:38.980
But what is this?
Where does this leave us?

28:39.140 --> 28:42.420
Just like when he went, with a
million questions and no answers.

28:42.580 --> 28:44.700
- No.
- Alan, don't walk away.

28:44.860 --> 28:46.620
- We can't do this again.
- Don't do this to me.

28:46.780 --> 28:49.220
Don't walk out when I need you
the most, please.

28:49.380 --> 28:50.620
Don't do it again.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.220
Like what you see?

29:24.820 --> 29:26.100
Ohh!

29:27.500 --> 29:29.660
<i>She's just the greatest kid.</i>

29:29.820 --> 29:33.540
And I know it's a terrible
parent cliché, but...

29:34.980 --> 29:37.460
she just makes me laugh
more than anyone else I know.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.460
- She sounds great.
- You should meet her.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.500
- I'd love to.
- So what about you?

29:41.660 --> 29:44.340
Nothing like that on the horizon?

29:44.500 --> 29:46.420
Fatherhood, responsibility?

29:46.580 --> 29:49.060
Oh, me? Nah, no chance!

29:49.780 --> 29:51.340
Slade said you were seeing someone.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.780
Er... yeah, I am.

29:54.940 --> 29:55.940
Laura.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.020
Yes... No, she's great.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.180
But, you know, early days.

30:01.940 --> 30:04.660
- Are you serious about her?
- I'm crazy about her.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.300
- And is she about you?
- Of course she is. Look at me.

30:07.460 --> 30:08.780
I'm a hell of a catch.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.580
No, I mean, she's just...

30:13.740 --> 30:16.300
Honestly, she's just a bit scared
of taking it to the next level.

30:17.780 --> 30:21.260
Anyway, tell me about... Stuart.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.820
Erm...

30:22.980 --> 30:25.100
We met in the States.

30:25.260 --> 30:28.260
He worked in the building next to
the hospital I was working in.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.300
I used to see him the whole time.

30:30.460 --> 30:33.940
I mean, I never thought I'd end up
with someone in finance.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.980
But he's just one of those people.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.940
He gets what he wants.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.340
You know.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.380
And I guess he wanted me.

30:50.060 --> 30:51.740
God!

30:54.180 --> 30:57.060
Know what? I've really missed you
over the years.

30:58.060 --> 30:59.580
Me too.

31:00.140 --> 31:03.820
You know, you're the only person
that I was ever able to talk to,

31:04.380 --> 31:06.340
after Jesse...

31:19.660 --> 31:24.020
Why didn't you contact me...
when you came back?

31:25.020 --> 31:27.060
You know, no bullshit, Pru.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.220
The real reason.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.140
I don't know. I just...

31:38.100 --> 31:40.260
I just thought...

31:40.860 --> 31:42.900
the past was better left alone.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.620
It's Slade. Hey, Slade.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.060
Just checking in to see you're OK.
Where are you?

31:55.220 --> 31:57.180
- I'm just out.
- Out where?

31:57.340 --> 31:59.300
<i>Just out with a friend.</i>

31:59.660 --> 32:01.660
<i>With a friend?</i>

32:01.820 --> 32:03.700
Yes, Slade, a friend.
I do have them.

32:04.580 --> 32:05.740
Put her on.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.420
Sorry?

32:08.580 --> 32:10.780
Pru. Put her on.

32:10.940 --> 32:13.260
<i>Hello?</i>

32:13.420 --> 32:15.020
Hi, Pru.

32:15.180 --> 32:18.380
<i>How's he doing? He didn't seem
too good the other night.</i>

32:18.540 --> 32:21.220
Yeah, you know, he's fine,
considering.

32:21.380 --> 32:24.140
- Did he speak much about Jesse?
- <i>Not really.</i>

32:24.300 --> 32:26.700
<i>Did he tell you he went
to see Marosi?</i>

32:26.860 --> 32:28.140
No.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.820
He's bottling it up. He's dealing
with this all on his own.

32:31.980 --> 32:33.020
Come on!

32:33.180 --> 32:36.500
<i>I bet he didn't tell you
his girlfriend dumped him.</i>

32:36.660 --> 32:38.260
Hold on one second.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.060
All right, you horrible lot.
Leave him alone.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.740
What's going on, Stevie?
Talk to me.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.540
I don't want to take it.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.620
I think you should kick that ball
as hard as you can.

32:52.260 --> 32:53.860
Go for it.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.940
Listen to me, Pru.
He's going through a lot right now.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.940
<i>Promise me you'll be there
if he needs you.</i>

33:01.100 --> 33:02.380
I promise.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.100
<i>OK, great. Bye.</i>

33:36.380 --> 33:37.900
I think I have one for you.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.220
Please.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.659
- Please, no.
- It's all right.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.500
I'm here to help you.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.739
Mark, it's me.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.300
Listen.

34:38.060 --> 34:39.900
I need Pru's number.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.820
She should be in hospital.

34:47.980 --> 34:49.860
No. Sorry, no can do.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.900
Hospitals require all kinds of
information. No, you're doing great.

34:54.380 --> 34:55.699
She needs an internal scan.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.820
Did she have anything on her
like a phone or ID?

34:57.980 --> 34:59.020
No.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.180
Nothing. She's yet to speak.

35:01.340 --> 35:03.580
Slade, you've dragged me
into this, yeah?

35:03.740 --> 35:05.740
- And I want things done properly.
- Pru.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.700
This girl has been attacked,
and that requires the police.

35:08.860 --> 35:11.340
Listen, if we call the police,
we lose their trust.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.060
If we lost their trust
then we have nothing, OK?

35:14.220 --> 35:15.780
No police.

35:17.980 --> 35:20.740
So what are you going
to do about it?

35:26.020 --> 35:28.940
Hey. How did the meeting
with Marosi go?

35:29.100 --> 35:31.940
Yeah, it was wonderful.
Listen, mate, can you get into work?

35:32.100 --> 35:33.620
I'm still here. Why?

35:33.780 --> 35:36.300
<i>Good, cause I'm gonna send you
a photo of a girl.</i>

35:36.460 --> 35:39.100
Theoretically, have you had a girl
reported missing recently,

35:39.260 --> 35:40.420
looks like this?

35:40.580 --> 35:43.780
<i>She's got a really distinctive
birthmark below her eye.</i>

35:43.940 --> 35:45.260
What's this about?

35:45.420 --> 35:48.500
- I can't tell you that yet, mate.
- <i>Let me get this straight.</i>

35:48.660 --> 35:52.020
I'm in the middle of a murder
investigation and dead on my feet.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.660
<i>You want me to trawl through
missing persons for God knows what,</i>

35:55.820 --> 35:57.260
<i>risking my career for God knows why,</i>

35:57.420 --> 35:59.220
and you expect this
just cause we're friends?

36:00.540 --> 36:01.980
Yeah, pretty much mate, yeah.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.820
I'll call you if I find anything.

36:12.340 --> 36:15.420
Hey, any luck tracing the dead
woman through the phone networks?

36:15.580 --> 36:17.740
Nada. Zip. Nix.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.020
Yeah, a simple "no" is fine.

36:21.620 --> 36:22.980
No.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.060
Hey, Danny.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.580
Any news, mate?

36:54.740 --> 36:57.260
Yep, her name's Gemma Morgan.

36:57.420 --> 36:58.700
She's on here.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.580
She's officially a missing person.

37:00.740 --> 37:01.900
<i>Since when?</i>

37:02.060 --> 37:04.100
Well, here's the kicker.

37:04.780 --> 37:06.820
<i>She disappeared five years ago.</i>

37:08.100 --> 37:09.780
<i>Five years?</i>

37:09.940 --> 37:11.980
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

37:22.380 --> 37:24.740
My brother went missing too.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.300
When he was five years old.

37:33.220 --> 37:35.100
I've never seen him again.

37:39.140 --> 37:41.420
It's hard on those
that are left behind.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.500
You know.

37:46.100 --> 37:49.340
You've been missing
for a really long time, Gemma.

37:52.140 --> 37:54.140
Where have you been?

37:56.020 --> 37:58.300
Were you with someone?

37:58.820 --> 38:00.860
Did someone take you?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.980
Were you held against your will?

38:06.500 --> 38:08.420
Gemma...

38:08.580 --> 38:10.460
you can tell me.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.900
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.620
We'll do everything we can
to help you.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.540
Were you held?

38:24.980 --> 38:27.220
Can you tell me where you've been?

38:32.340 --> 38:33.620
Not just me.

38:39.420 --> 38:41.300
I'm not the only one.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.460
There are more.

38:49.420 --> 38:53.060
<i>More? I mean, how many?
What are we supposed to do about that?</i>

38:53.220 --> 38:56.700
Tread carefully. The last thing we
want to do is to freak her out.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.220
One piece of information at a time.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.100
No, this is massive.

39:02.260 --> 39:05.620
You know, maybe Pru's right. Maybe
we need to get the cops in on this.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.780
- Danny, at least.
- No, no, no. Not yet.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.700
All right? Hey.

39:09.860 --> 39:11.900
Don't you just love the city
at night?

39:12.060 --> 39:14.260
I wish I was one of
those insomniacs.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.820
I could live my whole life at night.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.580
Except I'd probably get rickets
or something.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.620
- Right.
- Jammy doughnut?

39:20.780 --> 39:23.220
- No, I'm all right, thanks.
- Where is she?

39:23.380 --> 39:24.660
In there.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.500
So what's the story, then?

39:26.660 --> 39:28.740
Just look after her,
make sure she's OK.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.780
Help her settle in. Be kind.

39:30.940 --> 39:32.500
Yeah, got you.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.940
- Right?
- Mm-hm.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.340
Hey, Br...

39:48.500 --> 39:49.820
Brit?

39:53.980 --> 39:55.420
Brit?

40:13.100 --> 40:15.140
- No, I should check it.
- Ohh!

40:15.300 --> 40:17.220
- Let me guess. Work?
- What?

40:17.380 --> 40:20.620
<i>We've finally traced the mobile
of the victim from the scene</i>

40:20.780 --> 40:22.660
<i>where we found your friend's DNA.</i>

40:22.820 --> 40:25.140
Her name's Annie Green.
Know the best bit?

40:25.300 --> 40:27.620
- It's turned on.
- So we can track it?

40:27.780 --> 40:30.180
- I'm already on it.
- <i>All right.</i>

40:33.100 --> 40:34.980
I have to go.

40:35.140 --> 40:37.740
Momma, my sister... I have to go.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.460
I will see you later.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.980
- I will come back.
- Go!

40:43.540 --> 40:46.060
Chop's on the way there now.

40:46.220 --> 40:48.220
Listen up, I'm gonna take the front.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.540
I want two cars out the back.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.740
Come with me.
Ally, round the back!

40:58.100 --> 40:59.340
Hold the door.

41:03.580 --> 41:04.460
He's gone upstairs.

41:15.820 --> 41:16.660
Police!

41:33.620 --> 41:36.340
<i>South on Craig Street.
Moving south on Craig Street.</i>

41:44.620 --> 41:46.740
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. Get him.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.260
<i>He's heading into the building.</i>

41:55.660 --> 41:57.900
Mickey? I've lost him.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.420
He's headed towards
the east of the building!

42:08.860 --> 42:11.580
<i>Got him?</i>

42:51.260 --> 42:54.620
Are you Jesse? Are you Jesse?
Tell me if you're Jesse!

42:56.460 --> 42:58.860
Just tell me if you're Jesse!

43:00.620 --> 43:02.700
Are you Jesse?

43:24.700 --> 43:25.780
Jesse!
