WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:09.509
Hello, Roz.
Hey.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.577
So, what are
you up to?

00:10.577 --> 00:13.079
Oh, they put in phone jacks
so you can go on line.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.348
I was just talking to this guy
who sounds really great.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.616
(sighs)

00:16.616 --> 00:17.617
What?

00:17.617 --> 00:19.119
I'm a very busy person.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.954
How else am I going
to meet people?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.322
Just seems so
impersonal, Roz.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.325
I mean, my God, what ever
happened to human contact?

00:25.325 --> 00:27.327
Engaging people
face-to-face, eye-to-eye.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.828
There's your Dad.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.830
Oh, don't let
him see me.

00:31.331 --> 00:31.831
Hey, Martin.

00:32.332 --> 00:32.832
Hey, Roz.
Hi.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.334
What you been up to?

00:34.334 --> 00:35.835
Oh, just
surfing the Net.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.604
Hi, Dad. You know,
I never got

00:37.604 --> 00:38.872
into that Net stuff.

00:38.872 --> 00:39.773
ROZ:
Really?

00:39.773 --> 00:41.207
You really ought
to give it a try.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.208
It's a great way
to keep in touch

00:42.208 --> 00:43.543
with your friends
and your family.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.811
Family?

00:44.811 --> 00:46.880
Gosh, you know,
that's nice to know

00:46.880 --> 00:49.749
that some people still
care about their family.

00:49.749 --> 00:50.550
Dad, please?

00:50.550 --> 00:51.951
Well, I got to go.

00:51.951 --> 00:54.521
I'm going night fishing
with Duke and Eddie, of course.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.022
You know,
I wouldn't leave Eddie.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.926
You don't turn
your back on your family.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.128
What is that all about?

01:02.128 --> 01:03.963
Oh, our Cousin Dodie's
wedding was last week.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.733
Oh, excuse me--
Cousin Dodie's weddin'.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.969
It's a Western theme.

01:09.969 --> 01:13.473
On the response card, it asked
for our chili preference--

01:13.473 --> 01:15.308
mild or kick-ass-- oh.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.379
Anyway, Niles and I told her
that we had a conference

01:19.379 --> 01:21.748
to attend
at the Therapists' Guild.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.550
There is no
Therapists' Guild, is there?

01:23.550 --> 01:25.051
No.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.019
Dad found us out.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.487
Wait.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.556
Didn't you have
a "Therapist's Guild" conference

01:29.556 --> 01:31.558
on Alice's last birthday?

01:31.558 --> 01:34.427
The point is,
it struck a nerve with Dad.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.296
Sorry, Roz, it's
just that, you know.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.298
he thinks we're ashamed
of his family.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.300
It's been an issue
with him for years.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.668
Now he hasn't spoken
to me for days.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.571
Oh, thank God, I don't have
to deal with this tonight.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.907
I've already earmarked a fine
bottle of Chateau Beychevelle.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.609
Ah, hot date?
(chuckling)

01:49.609 --> 01:51.010
No, no. Niles is coming over

01:51.010 --> 01:53.279
to watch
The Antiques Roadshow with me.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.515
I guess you'll be coming in
late tomorrow.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.016
It's our favorite
show, Roz.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.017
Party. Whee!

01:58.017 --> 02:00.019
All right, stop it.
That's enough.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.456
Oh, I think
the Roadshow

02:03.456 --> 02:05.525
is from Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, tonight--

02:05.525 --> 02:07.527
Amish country.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.429
Ooh, quilts.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.297
I'll uncork
the wine, Niles.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.066
You set out
the cheesecake.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.168
Dad.
Dad.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.904
Uh, I thought you were
going night fishing with Duke.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.842
You can't keep this
up forever, Dad.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.844
Well, all right, fine;
I hope you don't mind

02:24.844 --> 02:26.846
but Niles and I are
planning on watching

02:26.846 --> 02:28.581
a television show.
Oh, really?

02:28.581 --> 02:29.949
Well, I'm surprised
you don't have

02:29.949 --> 02:31.818
a conference to go to.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.219
Dad, we said
we were sorry

02:33.219 --> 02:34.220
about Dodie's wedding.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.055
Yes, and we did send her
a baby gift.

02:39.225 --> 02:40.593
Well, Duke canceled out on me.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.095
You can have the TV
in an hour.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.097
I just want to watch
my game show.

02:44.097 --> 02:44.998
(groans)

02:44.998 --> 02:47.667
Dad, please, not a game show.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.002
I happen to like it, all right?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.503
People bring in all their junk
from their attics,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.805
and these experts
tell them what it's worth.

02:55.508 --> 03:00.246
Are you talking
about The Antiques Roadshow?

03:00.246 --> 03:00.980
Yeah.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.415
Well, that's
the program

03:02.415 --> 03:04.751
Niles and I are
going to watch.

03:09.489 --> 03:10.990
I'll just check outside

03:10.990 --> 03:12.492
and see if the world
has ended.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.462
Well, if you want to watch it,
no one's stopping you.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.932
Oh. Wonderful.
(chuckles)

03:18.932 --> 03:20.433
APPRAISER:
And you have no idea

03:20.433 --> 03:21.935
what this writing desk
might be worth?

03:21.935 --> 03:23.937
WOMAN: No. My husband
bought it at a garage sale.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.438
Ooh, that's a lovely piece.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.906
I'd say it's Sheraton.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.842
APPRAISER: At auction,
this would bring in more than $8,000.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.278
Whoa! Ka-ching!

03:32.278 --> 03:34.214
WOMAN:
What about this chair?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.216
Is it an original, too?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.717
Oh, it certainly
looks it.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.219
Nah, nah, they
always do this--

03:39.219 --> 03:40.720
set them up on the first one

03:40.720 --> 03:42.589
and then lower the boom
on the second one.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.391
I think that carving looks
authentic. So does the inlay.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.793
No, no, no.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.294
APPRAISER:
I'm sorry to say

03:48.294 --> 03:51.497
this chair is a reproduction
worth at best $150.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.733
WOMAN:
Oh, what a shame.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.935
Keep watching, boys;
you'll get the hang of it.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.705
WOMAN: Well, I guess
we still have the desk.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.207
APPRAISER: The real clue here
is the veneer.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.711
Veneer. Veneer!
Veneer.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.713
HOST: And now for some
background information

04:06.713 --> 04:08.715
on the beautiful city
of Harrisburg.

04:08.715 --> 04:09.716
Mute!

04:09.716 --> 04:12.485
(laughing)

04:12.485 --> 04:14.153
Evening, all.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.188
Oh, hi, Daphne.
Hi. Hi, Daphne.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.156
Wow. Don't see
the three of you

04:17.156 --> 04:19.125
watching the same
show very often.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.493
What's going on?

04:20.493 --> 04:22.862
Pavarotti
jumping the Grand Canyon?

04:22.862 --> 04:24.197
It's The Antiques
Roadshow.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.199
So what you
got in the box?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.067
Oh, it's Donny's mother's
wedding gown.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.969
He wants me to wear it
at our wedding.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.337
What if I don't like it?

04:31.337 --> 04:33.506
Daphne, if you try it on,
we'd be glad to have a look.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.707
Just go put it on.

04:34.707 --> 04:35.942
Oh, Dad!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.277
Dad, turn it up.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.078
SARA BRIGGS:
But the real masterwork

04:39.078 --> 04:40.913
is this unique
art deco headboard.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.915
It features a variety
of veneers.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.917
Veneer. Veneer!
Veneer.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.387
Mahogany veneer...

04:47.387 --> 04:49.122
Veneer! Veneer.
Veneer.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.257
...burled walnut veneer...

04:51.257 --> 04:52.892
Veneer. Veneer!
Veneer.

04:52.892 --> 04:55.128
...and zebrawood veneer.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.629
Veneer. Veneer!
Veneer.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.333
Oh, God.

05:00.833 --> 05:04.337
Next week we got to pick
a different word.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.705
You know what?

05:05.705 --> 05:08.074
I need another
bottle of wine.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.075
Yeah, me, too.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.577
I love these educational shows.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.848
You know, I can't
get over Dad.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.850
It seems that
this little rift

05:17.850 --> 05:19.852
between us
has been mended.

05:19.852 --> 05:20.853
Oh, can you believe

05:20.853 --> 05:21.854
he used the word
"craftsman,"

05:21.854 --> 05:23.356
and he meant the
architectural style

05:23.356 --> 05:26.826
and not the
rotary sander?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.728
You know, that's uncanny.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.096
Well, you heard him.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.030
No, no, not that.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.932
You just said
"rotary sander."

05:34.667 --> 05:36.002
Dad, did we miss anything?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.503
Nah, just some bozo
with a credenza

05:37.503 --> 05:38.971
who doesn't know a Biedermeier

05:38.971 --> 05:40.907
from an Oscar Meyer.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.775
ANNOUNCER:
That's it for this week.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.677
See you next time
on The Antiques Roadshow.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.947
Next Saturday, the Roadshow
will be here in Seattle.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.583
Whoa! Viewers can bring
their treasures

05:50.583 --> 05:52.318
to the Convention Center
for a free appraisal.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.753
We ought to go.

05:53.753 --> 05:54.620
That'd be great.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.422
Well, sure, Dad.
Does sounds like fun.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.391
Yeah. You know, I'm going to go

05:58.391 --> 06:00.393
have a little root around
in my closet.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.395
I'll bet I can find a nice
little objet d'art

06:02.395 --> 06:03.763
they'll be interested in.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.667
It's as if that panhandler
I gave money to

06:07.667 --> 06:11.037
was a genie granting
all my wishes.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.741
Would you marry me in this?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.679
(whispering):
How much did you give him?

06:21.180 --> 06:22.682
It-it's attractive,
Daphne.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.183
It's a bit unorthodox.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.486
Yeah, that's
what I think.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.789
Donny, I've just put
your mum's wedding dress on.

06:29.789 --> 06:30.790
A miniskirt?!

06:30.790 --> 06:32.792
It's obscene. You can see...

06:32.792 --> 06:33.793
What?

06:33.793 --> 06:37.063
No, I took
the green box.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.364
(laughing):
Oh...

06:38.364 --> 06:39.866
No problem, then. Bye.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.367
I took the wrong dress.

06:41.367 --> 06:46.139
This is from his mother's third
marriage in 1968 in Las Vegas.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.742
(laughing heartily)

06:49.742 --> 06:51.677
Oh, can you believe
people actually

06:51.677 --> 06:53.179
used to dress like this?

06:53.179 --> 06:55.181
I wish I had
a picture of it

06:55.181 --> 06:56.682
for whenever
I needed a laugh.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.050
Niles.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.993
MARTIN: This bear clock's been
in the family for generations.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.928
I can't wait to
see what it's worth.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.497
Do you think they'll put
a dollar figure on it?

07:11.497 --> 07:12.999
That sounds about right.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.500
Very funny.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.969
But you know your grandpa
passed this down to me,

07:16.969 --> 07:19.439
and someday when I'm gone,
it'll be passed on to you.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.774
Dad, please, I don't even want
to think about that day.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.242
You know, I
got to go see

07:23.242 --> 07:25.678
if I can get this baby appraised.
All right.

07:25.678 --> 07:28.581
Oh, I am so sorry,
but on the way in,

07:28.581 --> 07:31.083
I had the most amazing
celebrity sighting.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.084
Hans Dietrich.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.085
The love seat expert.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.353
The very same.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.022
Oh! You know, he's
much smaller

07:36.022 --> 07:37.757
in person than on television.

07:37.757 --> 07:38.591
He's that big.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.859
Get out.
Yes.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.127
Hey, boys, come over here.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.662
They want to put me
and the clock on TV.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.664
Good Lord,
we can't appear on TV

07:44.664 --> 07:45.665
with that hideous thing.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.167
Everyone we know
watches this program.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.169
Well, thank God,
he didn't bring along

07:50.169 --> 07:52.171
that dreadful mounted
jackrabbit's head

07:52.171 --> 07:53.606
with the antelope horns.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.609
Oh, yes, the jackalope--

07:56.609 --> 07:59.512
Texas's answer to the Minotaur.
(groans)

07:59.512 --> 08:00.813
So, what do you think
about that, boys?

08:00.813 --> 08:02.815
They said they've never seen
anything like it.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.317
Well, Dad, you know,

08:04.317 --> 08:05.685
this could go either way.
Oh, I know.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.053
Don't worry about it.
I'm not going to act

08:07.053 --> 08:08.554
like one of those saps
I always make fun of.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.557
Doesn't matter if it's worth
two dollars or $2,000.

08:11.557 --> 08:12.558
I'm just going to say,

08:12.558 --> 08:13.993
"That's pretty much
what I figured."

08:13.993 --> 08:14.894
Tape's rolling.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.395
Oh.
Oh, Lord.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.396
Oh, okay, okay.

08:17.396 --> 08:20.399
Uh, guys, uh, which one of you
wants to come and hold it?

08:20.399 --> 08:22.668
No, no, Dad, we
wouldn't dream of it.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.470
This is your moment.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.972
WOMAN:
Everybody ready?

08:25.972 --> 08:26.973
Action.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.474
So, Martin,
what can you tell us

08:28.474 --> 08:29.976
about this pewter clock?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.477
Well, it is a clock
set in the stomach

08:32.477 --> 08:35.414
of what appears
to be a bear.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.317
APPRAISER: Actually, it's
much more than that.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.785
It's Russian, made
in the mid-19th century.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.690
That's pretty much
what I figured.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.659
Actually,
it's a stunning piece.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.661
It was made
by Andrei Kuragin

08:48.661 --> 08:50.663
who worked
for Tsar Alexander II.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.665
That is pretty much
what I figured.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.166
I don't know
if you're descended

08:54.166 --> 08:55.535
from the Romanoffs,
Martin,

08:55.535 --> 08:57.870
but all of Kuragin's
known bear clocks

08:57.870 --> 09:00.339
were done exclusively
for the Romanoff family

09:00.339 --> 09:02.842
and are now
in the Hermitage Museum

09:02.842 --> 09:04.343
in St. Petersburg.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.481
Martin,

09:08.481 --> 09:10.950
you may be surprised to learn
that this clock, at auction,

09:10.950 --> 09:14.387
would easily bring $25,000.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.821
Ka-ching!

09:15.821 --> 09:18.190
(laughing)

09:18.190 --> 09:19.191
Oh.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.726
What he means is

09:20.726 --> 09:23.229
that's pretty much
what we figured.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.168
FRASIER:
After you, Dad.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.736
Thank you.
(chuckles)

09:30.736 --> 09:32.738
Gosh, Dad, you know,
I've been thinking.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.740
Maybe we'll have to find
an appropriate place

09:34.740 --> 09:36.242
for the clock.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.012
How about right here
on this console, hmm?

09:40.012 --> 09:40.813
Oh, yes. I get it.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.316
Doesn't look quite
so bad to you guys

09:43.316 --> 09:45.818
now that you know it's
worth 25 grand, huh?

09:45.818 --> 09:47.253
Oh, I could kick myself

09:47.253 --> 09:50.590
for not bringing
that jackalope.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.461
Quite an amazing day, eh?

09:55.962 --> 09:56.963
(chuckling):
It certainly was.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.464
You know, Niles,
I've been meaning

09:58.464 --> 09:59.966
to ask you about something,
actually.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.467
You remember that appraiser

10:01.467 --> 10:04.470
said something about
the bear being from Russia

10:04.470 --> 10:06.973
and Dad being part of
the Romanoff family?

10:06.973 --> 10:08.975
Yeah, yeah. You know,
that struck my ear, too.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.209
Yes, yes.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.544
Course, I don't
seriously believe

10:11.544 --> 10:12.545
there's any real
chance of that.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.546
No, no, of course not.
No, no.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.047
It's a long shot, at best.
It's impossible.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.049
Although we do
have the bear.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.351
I know.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.619
Oh, Dad.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.654
Niles just reminded me
of something

10:21.654 --> 10:23.656
I'd completely forgotten.
Um...

10:23.656 --> 10:27.159
When the appraiser mentioned
that the bear was from Russia...

10:27.159 --> 10:28.628
Oh, yeah, well,
it probably got passed down

10:29.161 --> 10:30.162
through your
great-great-grandmother.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.564
She was from Russia.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.065
Aha!

10:33.065 --> 10:37.470
And he said something about
the, um, Romanoff family?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.306
Oh, yeah, that, huh?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.141
Sure you want
to hear about this?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.043
Yes, Dad.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.346
Well, I guess you would've
found out anyway

10:47.346 --> 10:48.848
after I died.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.283
We're royalty.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:01.560 --> 11:03.396
But I didn't want you
to grow up spoiled,

11:03.396 --> 11:08.701
so I abdicated and took a job
in Seattle on the police force.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.970
It was kind of
hard giving up

11:10.970 --> 11:12.938
that royal
way of life,

11:12.938 --> 11:14.907
but I think
maybe it's the swans

11:14.907 --> 11:16.275
that I miss most.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.246
Very funny, Dad.
Point taken.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.247
Sherry, Niles?
Please.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.748
Sorry to disappoint you.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.251
I know you'd rather be
anything in the world

11:25.251 --> 11:26.185
except Cranes.
Oh, Dad!

11:26.185 --> 11:28.654
Now, that is just not true.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.923
We are proud to be Cranes.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.058
It was just...

11:32.058 --> 11:33.826
innocent curiosity.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.695
Well, I got to go call Duke.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.196
But don't get excited.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.564
He's not a real duke.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.867
Well...

11:41.867 --> 11:43.269
we stepped in it that time.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.637
Yes.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.472
What the hell
is wrong with us?

11:46.972 --> 11:48.941
Asking whether or not
we're related to the Romanoffs

11:48.941 --> 11:50.476
and we'd just
gotten past

11:50.476 --> 11:51.977
this whole "Crane
shame" thing.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.480
We should've known
it would just upset him.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.482
Yes, and for what?

11:56.482 --> 11:59.485
Trying to find some
distant connection

11:59.485 --> 12:00.986
to royalty.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.423
Even if we could prove it,
what do we have?

12:04.423 --> 12:06.258
Story to tell at parties.

12:06.258 --> 12:07.626
Occasional seat
at a state dinner.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.095
Some meaningless title.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.463
(chuckles)
It's insane.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.797
Ridiculous.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.299
Destructive.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.301
Still, there is
this grandmother.

12:15.301 --> 12:16.802
I'm right behind you.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.304
You know, Niles,

12:18.304 --> 12:21.574
given our new pride
in the Crane name,

12:21.574 --> 12:25.144
perhaps it would behoove us
to research our family tree.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.946
Uh-huh. Actually, in a way,
we'd be honoring Dad.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.281
Yes. Of course,
we wouldn't need to tell him.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.583
No, no.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.417
Just a few hours

12:31.417 --> 12:34.253
on the Internet,
a trip to the library

12:34.253 --> 12:36.589
we could sketch in
the entire family tree.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.458
Sure, and if there should
happen to be a connection

12:39.458 --> 12:40.359
to the Romanoffs...

12:40.359 --> 12:43.195
Well, what harm is there
in that?

12:43.195 --> 12:45.231
Oh, God, it is amusing
to contemplate,

12:45.231 --> 12:46.732
isn't it, Niles?

12:46.732 --> 12:48.634
You, me, Dad...

12:48.634 --> 12:50.903
all part of

12:50.903 --> 12:54.507
an ancient and noble family.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.842
Okay, Eddie, the jackalope's
gonna get you!

12:56.842 --> 12:58.844
The jackalope is gonna get you!

12:58.844 --> 13:01.747
The jackalope...

13:08.687 --> 13:10.122
Hey, Frasier?
Huh?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.690
How's the
research going?

13:11.690 --> 13:13.125
Oh, well, sit down, Roz,
I'll bring you up to speed.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.093
No, thank you.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.394
I'm meeting someone.

13:15.394 --> 13:19.098
Dear God!

13:19.098 --> 13:21.000
Not one of your
Internet dalliances?!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.335
Oh, it's just
coffee, okay?

13:23.335 --> 13:24.670
Besides,
this guy's totally legit.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.604
He e-mailed me a picture.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.039
A picture. Oh, for
God's sake, Roz,

13:27.039 --> 13:28.541
what can you learn
from a picture?

13:28.541 --> 13:30.042
The man's probably a
lunatic, a psychopath...

13:30.042 --> 13:31.877
Oh, he's a pretty boy.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.679
Yeah.

13:33.679 --> 13:34.947
Wait a minute.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.715
I know this photo.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.118
It's the cover of this month's
Bidwell's catalog.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.753
Are you sure?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.087
I'm positive!

13:42.087 --> 13:45.457
I ordered those socks
and driving shoes.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.760
Why would someone do this?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.762
Well, he's probably some
insecure, would-be Romeo

13:49.762 --> 13:51.263
trying to lure you
into a meeting.

13:51.263 --> 13:54.266
Hello, Frasier.

13:54.266 --> 13:55.768
Noel.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.636
NOEL:
What have we here?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.004
An empty seat
next to yours.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.406
May I?
No!

14:00.406 --> 14:02.341
Of all the dumb-ass things
you've done

14:02.341 --> 14:03.809
to try to get me
to go out with you,

14:03.809 --> 14:05.845
e-mailing me this picture
is just

14:05.845 --> 14:07.813
the most moronic!
But, Roz!

14:07.813 --> 14:08.714
Forget it, buddy.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.950
I ought to take
your mouse cord and wrap it

14:10.950 --> 14:11.817
around your nerdy
little neck,

14:11.817 --> 14:15.321
until your eyes pop out
like champagne corks.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.823
But I didn't
send you this.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.825
Yeah, right.
Then who did?

14:19.825 --> 14:23.162
My guess would be,
that guy.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.964
(gasps)

14:24.964 --> 14:27.233
Oh, my God.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.368
Noel, Noel,
I'm so sorry.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.769
How sorry?

14:30.769 --> 14:32.705
Not that sorry.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.777
I just saw
the Bidwell's guy.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.212
So, Niles...

14:40.212 --> 14:41.780
how goes
the research?

14:41.780 --> 14:44.617
Oh, I think you're
going to be very pleased.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.418
According to this catalog
of Russian antiquities,

14:46.418 --> 14:50.823
the bear clock was last seen
in Moscow in 1879.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.992
Well, hold on
to your fur hat, Niles.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.962
I've just discovered that
our great-great-grandmother

14:56.962 --> 15:00.266
emigrated from Russia in 1879.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.035
Oh, my God,
it's all coming together.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.838
I can practically
picture the scene. Yes.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.608
Our great-great-grandmother,
smelling revolution in the wind,

15:09.608 --> 15:13.512
secretly slips away
in the black Russian night.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.448
Taking the bear clock with her
to remind her of richer days.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.750
Yes.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.620
The ticking hands of time
counting down her return--

15:21.620 --> 15:26.125
her royal power
merely hibernating.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.829
(phone rings)

15:32.331 --> 15:33.832
Yes?

15:33.832 --> 15:35.234
Yes, yes, I'll hold.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.602
Who is it?

15:36.602 --> 15:37.903
It's Dr. Myshkin.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.238
He's an attach￩
at the Russian Embassy.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.040
Also an expert
on the Romanoffs.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.775
Oh.
Yes, Dr. Myshkin.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.144
This evening...
would be fine.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.146
Uh, about 7:00?

15:47.646 --> 15:49.581
Yes, I live at the
Elliot Bay Towers.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.951
We'll see you then.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.353
He has some important
information for us.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.588
Oh, my God, Niles,
this is it.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.892
The final link
to our royal past.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.761
I'm going to issue
a press release.

16:02.761 --> 16:05.364
Not before I shout it
from the rooftops.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.131
Here's Dad.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.599
Hide everything.

16:07.599 --> 16:10.102
Hey, guys, I thought
I'd find you here.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.137
You know, you just missed
seeing yourself

16:12.137 --> 16:13.906
on The Antiques Roadshow.
Oh. Oh.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.075
Yeah. And you know, the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.444
Everybody wants
to buy that bear clock.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.913
You're not thinking of
selling it, are you?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.348
You're damn right I am.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.350
Some guy just offered me
$26,000 for it.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.353
I'm going to buy me a big
honkin' fishing boat--

16:27.353 --> 16:29.855
a Wave-Pounder 450
with a fun deck.

16:29.855 --> 16:33.625
Good for fishin', cruisin'
or just plain tubin'.

16:33.625 --> 16:34.893
Did you hear that, Frasier?

16:34.893 --> 16:37.396
We can go tubin'.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.365
(sotto voce):
Do something.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.866
You know, Dad,
perhaps Niles and I

16:40.866 --> 16:42.301
could sell the clock for you.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.770
Oh. I mean, we do know
the antiques world

16:44.770 --> 16:47.106
and, you know, we could
get you more than $26,000.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.741
I should think

16:48.741 --> 16:50.509
at least $30,000.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.511
Wow. You know, maybe I will
let you boys handle this.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.445
FRASIER:
It's a wise move, Dad.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.681
Yeah, we'd hate to see you
get manipulated. Oh.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.420
(doorbell rings)

17:01.420 --> 17:02.488
(footsteps)

17:02.488 --> 17:04.490
(door opening)

17:04.490 --> 17:05.424
Dr. Crane.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.893
Dr. Myshkin,
please come in.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.128
This is my brother,

17:10.128 --> 17:11.930
Dr. Niles Crane.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.232
(clicks heels together)

17:15.401 --> 17:16.835
Oh, there it is.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.771
Yes. Yes, please,
have a look.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.609
Is it authentic?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.310
Without a doubt.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.179
Frasier.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.513
I know.

17:28.513 --> 17:29.815
Daphne,
if you don't mind,

17:29.815 --> 17:31.250
you know,
there is some,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.152
uh, caviar on the ice
in the kitchen.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.120
Uh, now would be
the appropriate time.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.555
If you would,
please?

17:36.555 --> 17:39.491
Oh, I am so sorry.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.493
Here I am
dawdling with the laundry

17:41.493 --> 17:44.863
when it's ten minutes
into caviar time.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.167
As I mentioned,

17:48.167 --> 17:49.401
I have some information

17:49.401 --> 17:50.936
which should be interesting
to your family.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.871
Yes, yes, please,
make yourself comfortable.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.373
Uh, do tell.
Do tell.

17:54.373 --> 17:58.444
This is a copy of the diary
of Princess Sonya Romanoff,

17:58.444 --> 18:00.946
daughter to Tsar Alexander II.

18:00.946 --> 18:04.383
At 18, she fell in love
with a commoner, an American.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.651
(mouthing)

18:05.651 --> 18:07.886
Such a union would, of
course, be forbidden,

18:07.886 --> 18:10.756
but Sonya decided to give
everything up for love.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.191
(gasps)

18:12.191 --> 18:14.093
Quelle elegance.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.495
She enlisted the aid
of a scullery maid,

18:16.495 --> 18:18.997
who smuggled money, clothing,
and this bear clock

18:18.997 --> 18:19.998
out of the palace.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.000
She would elope
to America.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.836
Yes, that was her plan.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.571
But when Sonya

18:25.571 --> 18:27.873
found her way to the train
station under cover of night,

18:27.873 --> 18:30.175
the scullery maid
had absconded with everything,

18:30.175 --> 18:31.510
including the clock.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.778
Servants!

18:32.778 --> 18:35.581
There's a back
aching for the lash!

18:35.581 --> 18:38.450
I'm moving as fast as I can.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.594
But tell us,
how did we get our clock back?

18:48.594 --> 18:49.461
Yes, yes, yes,
tell us,

18:49.962 --> 18:52.464
how did great-great-
grandmama retrieve it?

18:52.464 --> 18:54.967
Uh, Drs. Crane, your ancestor
is not the princess.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.436
Your ancestor
is the scullery maid.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.176
Well, on behalf
of the Russian people,

19:04.176 --> 19:07.446
I thank you for
retrieving this for us.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.214
You mean, you're just going
to take it?!

19:09.214 --> 19:11.116
Well, its rightful place
is in the Hermitage Museum.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.852
But this-this clock has been
in our family for generations.

19:13.852 --> 19:14.653
Niles!
But...

19:14.653 --> 19:16.655
Dr. Crane, we could settle this
in the courts,

19:16.655 --> 19:17.656
but you wouldn't win.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.459
Do you really want this
to come out in the press?

19:20.459 --> 19:22.261
Well, do you really expect us
to just let you

19:22.261 --> 19:24.029
walk out of here
with a precious family heirloom?

19:24.029 --> 19:25.330
Did I mention
that your ancestor,

19:25.330 --> 19:27.332
before she married
a Noah Crane in 1882,

19:27.332 --> 19:31.270
worked as a prostitute
in New York?

19:31.270 --> 19:33.205
Enjoy your bear.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.708
Oh, hello.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.677
Dr. Profiry Myshkin.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.145
Oh, Marty Crane.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.146
Well, I see you
got the clock.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.015
That's right.
Good evening, all.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.383
MARTIN:
Bye.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.884
You sold it.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.853
Hope you
got a good price.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.355
Gee, Dad, I hope
you didn't buy a boat.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.224
No, you know,
I was thinking of it,

19:52.224 --> 19:54.092
and then I thought,
oh, hell, you know,

19:54.092 --> 19:55.394
we've been
getting along so well.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.729
You don't like fishing,
and you get seasick.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.132
Why buy something that
we can't all enjoy, you know?

20:00.132 --> 20:02.367
So I bought this!

20:02.367 --> 20:04.736
A Winnebago.
Yes.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.541
A big one.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.977
33-footer with air suspension
and power jacks.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.247
30,000 used, but you got
that much for the clock, right?

20:15.247 --> 20:16.648
Of course.

20:16.648 --> 20:17.649
(laughing):
Oh, that's great.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.084
We can go anywhere.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.620
You know,
the first place I want to go

20:21.620 --> 20:22.621
is Elmo, Nebraska.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.390
We got a whole mess of cousins
down there.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.971
Well...

20:38.971 --> 20:41.473
we're out $15,000 each.

20:41.473 --> 20:45.477
And we have to take
long trips in a Winnebago.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.989
And we're not Romanoffs.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.992
We're descended
from thieves and whores.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.000
You know,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.002
I remember reading
that Henry James

21:10.002 --> 21:13.005
once had a liaison with
a Russian prostitute

21:13.005 --> 21:14.973
in New York.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.509
I'm right behind you.
