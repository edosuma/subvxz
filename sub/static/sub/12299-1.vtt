01:07.434 --> 01:09.953
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Evening.

01:11.554 --> 01:13.556
Get your hair cut, Mctaggart.

01:22.816 --> 01:26.186
Ah, now, there's a message, Sergeant.
A message for us all.

01:27.470 --> 01:30.757
However, there is a time
and place for everything.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.542
Get it removed.

01:53.663 --> 01:56.866
Any serious problems while i've been away?

01:56.901 --> 01:58.868
No, Sergeant, nothing serious.

01:58.903 --> 02:00.852
Just the usual.

02:00.887 --> 02:04.708
Rape, sodomy, sacrilege.

02:04.743 --> 02:06.843
You know.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.965
The lord is my shepherd

02:12.000 --> 02:13.531
I'll not want

02:13.566 --> 02:19.456
He makes me down to lie

02:19.956 --> 02:22.692
In pastures green

02:22.727 --> 02:25.393
He leadeth me

02:25.428 --> 02:30.850
The quiet waters by

02:30.885 --> 02:36.771
He leadeth me

02:36.806 --> 02:43.213
The quiet waters by

02:45.665 --> 02:47.934
"I have received of the Lord...

02:48.368 --> 02:50.769
"that which also i delivered unto you.

02:50.804 --> 02:54.808
"And the Lord Jesus, the same night
in which he was betrayed,

02:55.208 --> 02:56.810
"took bread.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.629
"And when He had given thanks,

02:59.664 --> 03:03.633
"He broke it and said,

03:03.733 --> 03:06.186
"take, eat.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.270
"'This is my body,

03:09.305 --> 03:11.291
"'which is broken for you.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.694
"This do in remembrance of me. '

03:15.128 --> 03:20.567
"And after the same manner, He also took
the cup when he had eaten, saying,

03:20.867 --> 03:24.853
"'this cup is the new covenant in my blood.

03:24.888 --> 03:29.142
"'This do you, as oft as you drink it,
in remembrance of me.

03:29.177 --> 03:31.644
"'For as often as you eat this bread...

03:32.078 --> 03:34.913
"'and drink this wine,

03:34.948 --> 03:37.750
"'you do show the Lord's death...

03:37.785 --> 03:39.752
till He comes again. '"

03:53.883 --> 03:55.885
That's for his nibs.

03:56.186 --> 03:58.536
Postmarked Summerisle.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.041
- He's got a bit of skirt over there, I bet.
- What, him?

04:02.442 --> 04:05.326
The only woman he's interested in
is the Virgin Mary.

04:05.361 --> 04:08.164
- I thought he was going steady with Mary Bannorg.
- Steady's the word.

04:08.565 --> 04:12.018
Two years, he hasn't so
much as tickled her fancy.

04:12.053 --> 04:15.471
He's keepin' himself pure
for the wedding day.

04:18.308 --> 04:20.158
Ah, poor old Mary.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.779
I don't know what she sees in him.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.462
When those two are married,

04:24.497 --> 04:28.835
she'll spend more time on her knees
in church than on her back in bed.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.480
All right.

04:32.515 --> 04:34.524
Mornin', all.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.779
- Morning, Hugh.
- Good morning, Sergeant.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.812
Um, there's an anonymous
letter for you, Sergeant.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.047
Read it.

05:00.516 --> 05:02.534
"Dear Sergeant Howie,

05:02.569 --> 05:06.372
"none of us have seen May Morrison's
daughter Rowan since last year.

05:06.407 --> 05:10.176
"She's only 12 and has been missing...
from her home for many months.

05:10.211 --> 05:12.896
"She couldn't have left
the island by herself.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.783
"She's too young, and her mother
won't say anything about it,

05:17.183 --> 05:18.785
"just to mind
my own business.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.100
"Well, I reckon it's all our business
when a kid disappears,

05:21.135 --> 05:22.980
that's why i'm writing you this letter.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.841
"A child lover.
Summerisle.

05:26.876 --> 05:31.848
P.S. I enclose a picture
of Rowan Morrison. "

05:40.506 --> 05:43.309
- Gonna go, Sergeant?
- Aye, aye, of course.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.112
- Have you ever been there?
- Eh, no.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.849
I've tasted the famous apples,
of course, but, uh -

05:49.884 --> 05:52.344
it's odd, isn't it, all that fruit?

05:52.379 --> 05:54.769
Well, the whole
principality is odd.

05:54.804 --> 05:57.857
To start with,
they have no licensing laws.

05:57.892 --> 06:00.693
Singing and dancing
on a Sunday.

06:01.094 --> 06:05.131
Oh, aye, doubtless that would appeal to
a heathen brute like yourself, Mctaggart.

06:05.166 --> 06:09.435
However, this is still, in theory,
a law-abiding christian country,

06:09.936 --> 06:11.804
however unfashionable
that may seem.

06:13.489 --> 06:15.873
Well, I'll call in on this patrol.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.770
Will you call in at Mary's house,
tell her I'll be away overnight.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.309
Oh, I am come

06:42.344 --> 06:45.905
To the north country

06:46.480 --> 06:50.900
Ochon, ochon,

06:50.935 --> 06:55.680
Ochrie!

06:55.715 --> 06:59.319
Without a penny

06:59.419 --> 07:03.423
In my purse

07:03.823 --> 07:08.111
To buy a meal

07:08.211 --> 07:14.000
For me

07:14.301 --> 07:17.504
One time I had

07:17.804 --> 07:21.124
A hundred sheep

07:22.025 --> 07:26.529
Ochon, ochon,

07:26.564 --> 07:32.000
Ochrie!

07:32.035 --> 07:34.502
Skipping o'er

07:34.537 --> 07:39.425
Yon (that) narrow creek

07:39.460 --> 07:43.830
And growing wool

07:43.865 --> 07:48.334
For me

07:55.691 --> 07:58.694
It was upon a lammas night

07:59.195 --> 08:02.698
When corn rigs
are bonnie

08:03.199 --> 08:06.702
Beneath the moon's
unclouded light

08:06.737 --> 08:10.189
I held a while to Annie

08:10.289 --> 08:13.292
The time went by
with careless heed

08:13.543 --> 08:18.798
Till 'tween
the late and early

08:19.298 --> 08:24.428
With small persuasion
she agreed

08:24.463 --> 08:27.962
To see me
through the barley

08:27.997 --> 08:31.461
Corn rigs and barley rigs and

08:31.944 --> 08:37.414
Corn rigs are bonnie

08:37.450 --> 08:41.453
I'll not forget
that happy night

08:41.489 --> 08:48.227
Among the rigs with Annie

09:12.285 --> 09:14.420
Will you send a dinghy, please?

09:19.292 --> 09:24.430
Did you hear me?
I'd like a dinghy, if you please.

09:24.465 --> 09:28.935
Hello, sir! Have you lost
your bearings?

09:28.970 --> 09:31.402
No, sir, I don't think so.

09:31.437 --> 09:34.941
- This is Summerisle, is it not?
- It is, sir!

09:35.191 --> 09:37.693
Well, I'm right then. Now, would
you send a dinghy, please?

09:38.194 --> 09:42.698
I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
This is private property!

09:43.166 --> 09:46.669
You can't land here
without written permission!

09:47.036 --> 09:50.888
I, as you can see,
am a police officer.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.429
A complaint has been
registered by a resident

09:53.464 --> 09:56.511
of this island about a missing child.

09:56.546 --> 10:00.550
Now, that makes it a police matter,
private property or not.

10:00.683 --> 10:05.304
Now, will you send a dinghy, please?

10:14.447 --> 10:18.701
Corn rigs and barley rigs

10:18.736 --> 10:22.920
And corn rigs are bonnie

10:22.955 --> 10:26.959
I'll not forget
that happy night

10:26.994 --> 10:32.965
Among the rigs with Annie

10:46.696 --> 10:49.198
Good day to you, sir.
I'm the harbour master.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.718
Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.

10:51.753 --> 10:54.203
A missing child
is always trouble.

10:54.238 --> 10:57.171
Aye, aye, aye,
for everybody.

10:57.206 --> 11:00.209
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain matters to his lordship.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.177
He's most particular
who lands here.

11:03.212 --> 11:06.716
All in good time.
We, too, have our own particularities.

11:06.751 --> 11:10.720
You know her?
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

11:14.724 --> 11:17.692
No, no, never seen her before.

11:17.727 --> 11:20.479
I don't know the face either.
Do you know her, Kenny?

11:20.514 --> 11:23.232
She doesn't belong to this island.

11:23.733 --> 11:26.200
No, I never saw her before.

11:26.235 --> 11:29.739
No, she doesn't belong here
at all. Johnnie?

11:34.744 --> 11:37.211
No, can't say I know her.

11:37.246 --> 11:41.250
Now, now, what are you saying?
You're saying that she is not from the island.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.217
Aye, that's right.
She's not from here.

11:43.252 --> 11:46.722
Oh, you get Morrisons on Lewis and a
few on Mull. I would try there.

11:47.223 --> 11:49.190
Thanks.

11:49.225 --> 11:53.229
"None of us have seen May Morrison's
daughter Rowan since last year.

11:53.264 --> 11:57.233
She's only 12, and she's been missing
from her home for many months. "

11:58.234 --> 12:01.202
The mother's name
is May Morrison.

12:01.237 --> 12:04.205
Oh, May! She quite slipped my memory.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.743
Of course we've got May.
She keeps the post office in the high street.

12:07.778 --> 12:10.746
- May Morrison? You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

12:10.781 --> 12:13.749
Well, thank you
for your help.

12:15.751 --> 12:18.754
That's not May's daughter,
though!

12:20.756 --> 12:23.258
No, she's not May's.

12:23.293 --> 12:25.761
Then who is she?

12:35.271 --> 12:38.274
The sky was blue
the wind was still

12:38.774 --> 12:42.278
The moon was shining clearly

12:42.778 --> 12:45.648
I set her down
with right good will

12:46.148 --> 12:49.617
Among the rigs of barley

12:49.652 --> 12:53.289
I kenned her heart
with all my own

12:53.789 --> 12:58.544
I loved her most sincerely

12:59.045 --> 13:02.298
I kissed her o'er
and o'er again

13:02.333 --> 13:05.801
Among the rigs of barley

13:27.189 --> 13:29.692
- Good afternoon!
- I like your rabbits.

13:30.192 --> 13:35.197
Those are hares, not silly old rabbits.
Lovely march hares.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.648
Can I help you?

13:37.683 --> 13:39.650
- Mrs. Morrison- mrs. May Morrison?
- Yes.

13:39.685 --> 13:43.654
- Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
- Oh, my!

13:43.689 --> 13:47.193
Did you come over in that aeroplane
that I saw flying round?

13:47.228 --> 13:50.696
- Aye, that's right.
- What, just to see me?

13:50.731 --> 13:52.698
Well, no, not exactly.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.666
I'm making inquiries
about your daughter.

13:55.701 --> 14:01.207
- We understand that she's missing.
- Missing? My daughter?

14:01.242 --> 14:05.045
- Aye. You do have a daughter.
- Yes.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.848
- And that's her?
- Oh, never.

14:09.064 --> 14:11.567
I tell you no.

14:15.070 --> 14:17.573
I think you'd better
come with me.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.292
This is our Myrtle.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.294
She was nine last thursday.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.831
She's not a bit like the girl
in your photograph.

14:26.081 --> 14:28.584
She must be at least
13 or 14, surely.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.419
Myrtle, say hello.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.956
This is Sergeant- oh!
- Howie.

14:33.991 --> 14:35.958
- Oh.
- Hello, Myrtle.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.463
How do you do? Look, mummy, I'm drawing a hare.
- Ah.

14:40.498 --> 14:43.349
Excuse me, Sergeant.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.980
Hello.

15:00.483 --> 15:05.221
- Here you are. You can fill in the
ears in gray. Oh, sorry.

15:06.722 --> 15:08.724
Thank you, Myrtle.

15:13.229 --> 15:17.233
Myrtle, do you-
do you know Rowan?

15:17.733 --> 15:19.235
Of course I do.

15:20.736 --> 15:24.740
- You do?
- 'Course I do, silly.

15:27.743 --> 15:30.746
- Uh, do you know where she is now?
- In the fields.

15:31.113 --> 15:33.080
She runs and plays there all day.

15:33.115 --> 15:36.619
Does she?
Do you think she'll be coming back for tea?

15:36.886 --> 15:40.389
Tea? Hares don't
have tea, silly.

15:41.390 --> 15:44.358
- Hares?
- She's a hare.

15:44.393 --> 15:47.646
Rowan's a hare.
She has a lovely time.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.865
- Well, tell me-
- Well, now, Sergeant.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.903
You will stay and have
a cup of tea, won't you?

15:53.938 --> 15:56.370
- Oh, well, yes, yes, please.
- Good.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.372
- That's very kind of you.
- Um, not at all.

15:58.407 --> 16:01.911
It must be thirsty work, asking all those questions, eh?
- Ah, aye.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.113
- Hello.
- Good evening. Good evening.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.616
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

16:23.651 --> 16:25.583
Hello again.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.585
- Are you the landlord here?
- Aye.

16:27.620 --> 16:32.124
I'm Alder Macgreagor. And you must be
the policeman from the mainland.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.144
Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie,
West Highland constabulary.

16:35.179 --> 16:37.655
I'm quite obviously not going
to get back to the mainland tonight

16:37.690 --> 16:40.132
so I wondered if you had a room and
a bite of supper I could have.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.636
- Could you manage that?
- Aye, I think that can be arranged.

16:43.671 --> 16:47.640
My daughter Willow will show you to your room.
Willow!

16:47.675 --> 16:49.607
Father?

16:49.642 --> 16:54.146
This is Sergeant Howie,
a policeman from the mainland,

16:54.647 --> 16:56.649
who will be spending
the night with us.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.152
- This is my daughter, Willow.
- Good evening.

17:00.402 --> 17:03.155
Show the Sergeant
to his room, would you?

17:03.656 --> 17:07.410
Much has been said
of the strumpets of yore

17:07.444 --> 17:11.164
Of wenches and bawdy
house queens by the score

17:11.199 --> 17:14.867
But I sing of a baggage
that we all adore

17:14.903 --> 17:18.538
The landlord's daughter

17:18.921 --> 17:21.924
You'll never love another

17:22.391 --> 17:26.395
Although she's not the kind of girl

17:26.430 --> 17:29.398
To take home to your mother

17:33.903 --> 17:37.715
Her ale, it is lively
and strong to the taste

17:37.750 --> 17:41.527
It is brewed with discretion
never with haste

17:41.777 --> 17:45.665
You can have all you like
if you swear not to waste

17:45.700 --> 17:49.535
The landlord's daughter

17:50.036 --> 17:52.538
And when her name is mentioned

17:53.039 --> 17:58.544
The parts of every
gentleman do stand up

17:58.579 --> 18:00.046
At attention

18:03.432 --> 18:07.919
Now they say of the blossom
in all of the town

18:07.954 --> 18:12.458
That she takes off her garter
and starts on the tug

18:12.493 --> 18:15.520
That dolly who keeps her
ain't horrible now

18:15.555 --> 18:18.548
While I'll take
the landlord's daughter

18:18.948 --> 18:22.952
Oh, nothing can delight so

18:23.452 --> 18:28.406
- As does the part that lies between
- Her left toe

18:28.407 --> 18:31.527
And her right toe

18:49.411 --> 18:53.647
- I'd like my supper now, please.
- It won't be long, Sergeant.

18:53.682 --> 18:58.187
Oh, you don't want to let them worry you.
Why don't you have a wee drink?

18:58.222 --> 19:00.939
No, thank you, not just now.

19:09.915 --> 19:14.415
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.

19:15.150 --> 19:19.600
I am here to investigate the
disappearance of a young girl,

19:20.600 --> 19:23.429
as doubtless, the harbour master
has already told you by now.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.683
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.

19:27.718 --> 19:31.402
Would you pass that among
your customers, please?

19:31.437 --> 19:34.440
Now, if any of you can give me
any idea as to her whereabouts,

19:34.475 --> 19:36.442
I'd be most grateful
if you'd let me know.

19:51.073 --> 19:55.961
No, I'm afraid nobody's seen her, Sergeant.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.969
Thank you. These Harvest
Festival photographs?

20:04.004 --> 20:07.490
Aye. We have one taken at
the end of every summer.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.976
- What happened to last year's?
- Mm, it got broke.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.943
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.

20:12.978 --> 20:16.982
Willow, show the Sergeant
to the dining room.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.984
Thank you.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.682
It's disgusting.

20:35.184 --> 20:37.686
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?

20:37.721 --> 20:39.688
Aye, it's just that most
of the food I've had-

20:40.189 --> 20:45.677
the farmhouse soup, the potatoes,
broad beans- all come out of a can.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.664
Broad beans, in their natural state,
aren't usually turquoise,

20:49.164 --> 20:50.666
are they?
- Hmm.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.670
Some things in their natural state
have the most vivid colors.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.640
I just wanted to know why, that's all.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.178
Now, I wonder what you'll be
wanting for afters?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.930
- Hmm, I'll have an apple.
- No apples.

21:07.432 --> 21:11.385
No apples? On Summerisle?

21:11.420 --> 21:13.387
I expect they've all been exported.

21:13.422 --> 21:15.924
You can have peaches and cream,
if you like.

21:15.959 --> 21:18.427
Aye, from a can, I suppose.

21:18.462 --> 21:20.395
All right.

21:22.397 --> 21:26.018
Cheer up. Food isn't
everything in life, you know.

22:37.306 --> 22:39.273
Up, up, up, up!

22:39.308 --> 22:42.811
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

22:54.690 --> 22:58.694
- Where?
You'll find it at the top of the stair on your right.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.780
I put my hand

23:12.815 --> 23:15.661
On her knee

23:16.078 --> 23:18.446
And she says

23:18.481 --> 23:20.933
Do you want to see

23:21.833 --> 23:24.236
I put my hand
- Willow Macgreagor.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.555
On her breast

23:27.590 --> 23:30.475
And she says

23:30.876 --> 23:33.410
Do you want a kiss

23:33.445 --> 23:37.599
Willow Macgreagor, I have the honor
to present to you Ash Buchanan.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.802
Gently, Johnny
- Come up, Ash Buchanan.

23:41.103 --> 23:43.754
Gently, Johnny
my jingaloe

23:43.789 --> 23:45.672
another sacrifice
for Aphrodite, Willow.

23:45.707 --> 23:49.711
You flatter me, your lordship.
Surely you mean,"to aphrodite."

23:50.112 --> 23:51.713
I make no such distinction.

23:52.114 --> 23:56.234
You are the goddess of love in human form,
and I am merely your humble acolyte.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.772
Enjoy yourself, and him.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.992
Only make sure you are ready,
for tomorrow is tomorrow.

24:04.426 --> 24:07.829
The day of death
and rebirth.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.446
Yes.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.334
And of a somewhat
more serious offering...

24:12.734 --> 24:14.386
than tonight.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.694
I put my hand

24:38.729 --> 24:41.564
On her thigh

24:41.599 --> 24:44.365
And she says

24:44.400 --> 24:47.219
Do you want to try

24:47.720 --> 24:50.330
I put my hand

24:50.365 --> 24:52.941
On her belly

24:53.342 --> 24:55.010
And she says

24:55.911 --> 24:59.865
Do you want to fill me

24:59.900 --> 25:02.367
Gently, gently

25:02.868 --> 25:07.155
Gently, Johnny

25:07.190 --> 25:10.843
My jingaloe

25:10.878 --> 25:13.846
Gently, gently

25:13.881 --> 25:18.960
Gently, Johnny

25:18.995 --> 25:24.039
My jingaloe

25:31.713 --> 25:35.317
I think I could turn
and live with animals.

25:35.717 --> 25:39.002
They are so placid
and self-contained.

25:39.037 --> 25:43.708
They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins.

25:44.126 --> 25:48.630
They do not make me sick
discussing their duty to God.

25:48.930 --> 25:52.534
Not one of them kneels to another

25:52.634 --> 25:56.605
or to his own kind that lived thousands of years ago.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.389
Not one of them is... respectable

25:59.424 --> 26:02.010
Gently, gently
- or unhappy

26:02.494 --> 26:04.060
Gently, Johnny

26:04.095 --> 26:06.581
all over the earth.

26:07.082 --> 26:11.102
Gently, Johnny
my jingaloe

26:11.137 --> 26:14.106
Gently, gently

26:14.141 --> 26:18.594
Gently, Johnny

26:18.629 --> 26:23.048
My jingaloe

27:14.115 --> 27:15.717
Good morning,
Sergeant.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.637
- Morning.
- Isn't it glorious?

27:19.137 --> 27:21.139
Aye, aye,
it's very nice.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.926
I expect you'll be
going home tonight.

27:24.961 --> 27:26.945
Well, that depends.

27:29.464 --> 27:32.834
- Where's the school, please?
- On the far side of the green.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.971
Thank you.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.573
In the woods
there grew a tree

27:54.608 --> 27:57.826
And a fine, fine tree
was he

27:58.193 --> 27:59.945
And on that tree there was a limb

28:00.446 --> 28:01.947
And on that limb
there was a branch

28:02.448 --> 28:03.949
And on that branch
there was a nest

28:04.450 --> 28:05.951
And in that nest
there was an egg

28:06.452 --> 28:07.953
And in that egg
there was a bird

28:08.454 --> 28:09.955
And from that bird
a feather came

28:10.456 --> 28:13.959
And of that feather was

28:13.994 --> 28:20.716
A bed

28:23.685 --> 28:25.187
And on that bed
there was a girl

28:25.687 --> 28:27.439
And on that girl
there was a man

28:27.474 --> 28:29.191
And from that man
there was a seed

28:29.575 --> 28:31.076
And from that seed
there was a boy

28:31.577 --> 28:33.078
And from that boy
there was a man

28:33.579 --> 28:35.581
And for that man
there was a grave

28:35.831 --> 28:38.834
And from that grave
there grew

28:38.869 --> 28:44.957
A tree

28:48.577 --> 28:50.570
And on that bed
there was a girl

28:50.605 --> 28:52.564
And on that girl
there was a man

28:53.065 --> 28:55.567
And from that man there was a seed,
and from that seed there was a boy

28:55.818 --> 28:57.820
And from that boy
there was a man

28:58.320 --> 28:59.822
And for that man
there was a grave

29:00.322 --> 29:03.826
And from that grave
there grew

29:03.861 --> 29:10.449
A tree

29:13.452 --> 29:16.104
And on that tree there was a limb
and on that limb

29:16.139 --> 29:18.757
There was a branch and on that
branch there was a nest

29:18.792 --> 29:20.724
And in that nest
there was an egg

29:20.759 --> 29:24.263
And in that egg there was a bird,
and from that bird, a feather came

29:24.763 --> 29:27.766
And of that feather was

29:28.133 --> 29:31.019
A bed

29:33.021 --> 29:37.525
Very well, girls. That's enough.
Now it's time to pay attention to me.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.993
Now, uh, Daisy,

29:40.028 --> 29:44.532
will you tell us what it is, please,
that the maypole represents?

29:48.536 --> 29:52.540
Really, Daisy.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.044
- You've been told often enough.
- Miss Rose, I know!

29:56.411 --> 29:59.798
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.

29:59.833 --> 30:03.802
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.

30:03.837 --> 30:06.304
It is the image
of the penis,

30:06.805 --> 30:09.808
which is venerated
in religions such as ours,

30:09.809 --> 30:12.900
as simbolising the generative
force in nature.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.782
Oh, can I help you?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.785
C- could-could I have a word
with you, please, miss?

30:21.820 --> 30:26.324
Certainly. Girls, open your desks
and take out your exercise books.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.698
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall
report this to the proper authorities.

30:33.733 --> 30:35.800
Everywhere I go on this island,
it seems to me I find degeneracy.

30:36.301 --> 30:40.805
and there is brawling in bars,
there is indecency in public places,

30:41.306 --> 30:43.808
and there is corruption of the young,
and now I see it all stems from here-

30:43.843 --> 30:46.276
it stems from the filth taught
here in this very schoolroom.

30:46.311 --> 30:51.433
I was unaware that the police had
any authority in matters of education.

30:51.468 --> 30:54.401
Aye, aye, well,
we'll see about that.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.939
Girls, could I have
your attention, please?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.444
Now, I am a police officer.

31:02.911 --> 31:06.379
Well, as you can see.

31:06.414 --> 31:08.882
I have come here
from the mainland...

31:08.917 --> 31:12.420
to investigate the disappearance
of a young girl.

31:12.455 --> 31:15.388
I have a photograph here-
excuse me-

31:15.423 --> 31:19.677
which I would like you to pass
around amongst yourselves.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.932
Meanwhile, I'll write her name
over there on the blackboard.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.699
Rowan Morrison.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.202
That's her name.

31:46.204 --> 31:49.707
Now, do any of you recognize either
the name or the photograph?

31:50.208 --> 31:53.179
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.

31:53.180 --> 31:56.432
If she existed, we would know.

31:56.467 --> 31:59.684
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.190
Thank you.

32:13.448 --> 32:17.452
The little old beetle goes round and round,
always the same way, you see,

32:17.836 --> 32:22.841
till he ends up right up tight
to the nail, poor old thing.

32:23.091 --> 32:26.094
"Poor old thing"?

32:26.594 --> 32:30.223
Then why in God's name
do you do it, girl?

32:30.258 --> 32:33.817
I'd like to see the
school register, please.

32:33.852 --> 32:36.356
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.

32:36.357 --> 32:37.900
This is a police matter.

32:38.356 --> 32:41.856
I'm afraid you'll have to have
a search warrant or permission

32:41.857 --> 32:43.326
from Lord Summerisle himself.

32:43.361 --> 32:46.364
I'm afraid you'll just have to
bear with me, won't you?

33:06.017 --> 33:09.485
You're liars. You are
despicable little liars.

33:09.520 --> 33:15.526
Rowan Morrison is a schoolmate
of yours, isn't she?

33:15.561 --> 33:18.494
And that is her desk, isn't it?

33:18.529 --> 33:20.498
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know-

33:20.533 --> 33:24.269
And you are the biggest liar of all.

33:24.304 --> 33:27.156
I warn you,
one more lie out of you,

33:27.191 --> 33:29.973
and I will charge you
with obstruction,

33:30.008 --> 33:34.012
and, believe me, Miss Rose,
that is a promise.

33:36.514 --> 33:40.017
Now, for the last time,

33:40.052 --> 33:43.486
where is Rowan Morrison?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.490
I would like to speak
to you outside, Sergeant.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.957
Girls, get on
with your reading.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.996
It's the Rites and Rituals of May Day,
chapter five. I won't be long.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.968
Well?

33:59.003 --> 34:04.008
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.

34:04.258 --> 34:07.261
If Rowan Morrison existed,
we would know of her.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.013
You mean,
she doesn't exist?

34:09.514 --> 34:11.014
She's dead?

34:13.016 --> 34:15.503
You would say so.
Oh, come on, come on.

34:15.538 --> 34:17.989
She's either dead,
or she's not dead.

34:18.024 --> 34:22.610
Here, we do not use
the word-

34:24.112 --> 34:26.079
We believe...

34:26.114 --> 34:29.367
that when the human life
is over,

34:29.402 --> 34:33.263
the soul returns
to trees, to air,

34:33.297 --> 34:37.090
to fire, to water,
to animals,

34:37.125 --> 34:40.128
so that Rowan Morrison
has simply returned...

34:40.163 --> 34:42.630
to the life forces
in another form.

34:43.130 --> 34:47.135
Do you mean to say you teach
the children this stuff?

34:47.170 --> 34:51.156
Yes. I told you,
it is what we believe.

34:51.190 --> 34:55.143
They never learn anything
of christianity?

34:55.178 --> 34:57.610
Only as
a comparative religion.

34:57.645 --> 35:00.648
The children find it
far easier to picture...

35:00.683 --> 35:05.118
reincarnation
than resurrection.

35:05.153 --> 35:10.658
Those rotting bodies are a great stumbling
block for the childish imagination.

35:11.659 --> 35:14.610
Why, of course.
And may I ask,

35:14.645 --> 35:17.613
where is the rotting body
of Rowan Morrison?

35:17.648 --> 35:22.153
Right where you'd expect it to be-
in the earth.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.155
You mean,
in the churchyard?

35:24.655 --> 35:26.657
- In a manner of speaking.
- No.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.625
In plain speaking.

35:29.660 --> 35:33.664
The building attached to the
ground in which the body lies...

35:33.699 --> 35:36.632
is no longer used
for christian worship,

35:36.667 --> 35:41.039
so whether it is still
a churchyard is debatable.

35:41.506 --> 35:46.177
But forgive me. I must get back to my girls.
Good morning to you.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.629
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan,

36:23.664 --> 36:28.169
protected by the ejaculation
of serpents. "

37:34.952 --> 37:38.421
- Morning.
- Morning.

37:38.456 --> 37:41.459
I see you plant trees
on most of the graves here.

37:41.494 --> 37:44.962
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?

37:44.997 --> 37:47.296
That's a rowan.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.318
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.

37:54.822 --> 37:57.825
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.

37:57.860 --> 38:01.794
They're just a wee bit late
with the headstone.

38:01.829 --> 38:03.331
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.

38:03.831 --> 38:06.799
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?

38:06.834 --> 38:11.304
The poor wee lassie's
navel string, of course.

38:11.339 --> 38:17.094
Where else should it be but hung
on her own little tree?

38:17.129 --> 38:19.347
Where does your minister live?

38:19.382 --> 38:22.850
Minister?

38:25.820 --> 38:29.457
Minister.

38:44.972 --> 38:46.974
Oh, what a silly girl you are
to make all this fuss.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.542
It's just a little frog.

38:49.577 --> 38:53.045
It'll do that poor
sore throat good.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.199
Now, anyone would think
you didn't want to get better.

38:55.234 --> 38:58.452
Now, in he goes.

39:02.089 --> 39:06.711
And out he comes. There. Now,
that didn't hurt much, did it?

39:07.094 --> 39:10.179
- It tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.

39:10.214 --> 39:14.718
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Come on. Which one would you like?

39:14.753 --> 39:19.223
There. He's got your horrid old sore
throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?

39:19.258 --> 39:21.290
Can't you
hear him croaking?

39:21.325 --> 39:24.794
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?

39:24.829 --> 39:29.700
I doubt it,
seeing you're all raving mad.

39:33.638 --> 39:38.643
Doctor, tell me, did you sign Rowan
Morrison's death certificate?

39:38.678 --> 39:41.445
Uh, Rowan Morrison.
Yes, I did. Why?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.412
Could I see it,
please?

39:43.447 --> 39:45.969
You, of all people, should
know that death certificates

39:46.004 --> 39:47.969
are kept in the public
records office.

39:48.004 --> 39:49.971
Now, if you
will excuse me.

39:50.006 --> 39:51.973
Doctor.

39:52.373 --> 39:54.825
Tell me,
how did Rowan Morrison die?

39:55.259 --> 39:58.027
She was burnt to death,

39:58.062 --> 40:01.465
as my lunch will be
if I continue talking to you.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.147
- Good day.
- Good day.

40:18.182 --> 40:24.188
- I'd like to see your index of deaths, please.
- Do you have authority?

40:27.191 --> 40:30.660
- No, I meant from his lordship.
- I don't need it.

40:30.695 --> 40:35.700
I'm afraid you have to get
permission from Lord Summerisle.

40:35.735 --> 40:41.671
Miss, if you don't cooperate
with me here and now,

40:41.706 --> 40:46.210
you may well find yourself inside a police
cell on the mainland tonight.

40:46.327 --> 40:49.830
Have I made myself
quite clear?

40:49.865 --> 40:51.832
Please.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.308
Thank you.

41:02.343 --> 41:04.829
"M."
"m," "m," "m," "m. "

41:05.813 --> 41:08.781
"Benjamin and Rachel
Morrison. "

41:08.816 --> 41:14.321
- Rachel and Benjamin- names from the Bible.
- Yes.

41:14.356 --> 41:17.790
They were very old.

41:17.825 --> 41:21.293
But, there's no record
of Rowan Morrison's death,

41:21.328 --> 41:25.833
which means, of course,
there is no death certificate.

41:27.835 --> 41:30.838
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.

41:34.842 --> 41:37.344
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.

41:39.313 --> 41:41.315
How did she die?

41:43.317 --> 41:48.956
- I don't know.
- I don't know anything about her. Nothing.

41:55.463 --> 41:57.965
Thank you.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.589
Are you mr. Lennox,
the photographer?

42:06.090 --> 42:09.977
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist,
secondly a photographer.

42:10.478 --> 42:12.480
I understand that you take the harvest
festival photographs every year-

42:12.980 --> 42:14.482
the ones I saw
in The Green Man.

42:14.982 --> 42:18.951
Yes, it's rather humdrum work,
I'm afraid.

42:18.986 --> 42:21.490
Do you know what happened
to last year's photograph?

42:21.525 --> 42:22.455
Isn't it with the others?

42:22.490 --> 42:25.993
No, no, it's not. No, apparently it's been
broken or damaged in some way.

42:26.028 --> 42:29.997
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?

42:30.498 --> 42:33.000
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.

42:33.501 --> 42:37.004
Mr. Lennox, you were among the people
to whom I showed the photograph

42:37.505 --> 42:39.757
in the Green Man.

42:39.792 --> 42:41.974
Is that the girl?

42:42.009 --> 42:45.513
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!

42:45.996 --> 42:51.001
It was only eight months ago. Surely
you remember if it was that girl or not.

42:53.003 --> 42:55.005
Thank you.

42:56.006 --> 42:59.985
Corn rigs and barley rigs

43:00.020 --> 43:03.964
And corn rigs are bonnie

43:04.465 --> 43:07.968
I'll not forget
that happy night

43:08.003 --> 43:13.974
Among the rigs with Annie

43:51.645 --> 43:57.084
Take the flame inside
you burn and burn below

43:57.119 --> 44:02.523
Fire seed and fire feed
and make the baby grow

44:02.558 --> 44:04.525
Take the flame inside you

44:04.560 --> 44:06.527
Burn and burn belay

44:07.027 --> 44:14.034
Fire seed and fire feed
and make the baby stay

44:14.385 --> 44:17.888
Take the flame inside you
burn and burn belong

44:18.138 --> 44:25.029
Fire seed and fire feed
and make the baby strong

44:25.396 --> 44:29.400
Take the flame inside you
burn and burn belie

44:29.783 --> 44:34.805
Fire seed and fire feed
and make the baby cry

44:34.840 --> 44:38.584
Take the flame inside you
burn and burn begin

44:38.619 --> 44:42.329
Fire seed and fire feed
and make the baby king

44:42.813 --> 44:44.763
- His lordship is expecting you, sir.
- Expecting me?

44:44.798 --> 44:48.302
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?

44:50.304 --> 44:52.306
In there, sir.

45:35.082 --> 45:38.550
Good afternoon,
Sergeant Howie.

45:38.585 --> 45:41.588
I trust the sight of the young
people refreshes you.

45:41.623 --> 45:45.092
No, sir,
it does not refresh me.

45:45.127 --> 45:47.059
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:47.094 --> 45:50.097
One should always be open
to the regenerative influences.

45:52.099 --> 45:55.102
- I understand you're looking for a missing girl.
- I've found her.

45:55.602 --> 45:58.070
- Splendid.
- In her grave.

45:58.105 --> 46:00.107
Your lordship is
a justice of the peace.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.226
I need your permission to exhume
her body, have it transported

46:02.261 --> 46:04.228
to the mainland
for a pathologist's report.

46:04.478 --> 46:07.329
You suspect... foul play?

46:07.364 --> 46:10.367
I suspect murder
and conspiracy to murder.

46:10.402 --> 46:13.585
In that case,
you must go ahead.

46:13.620 --> 46:17.089
Your lordship seems
strangely unconcerned.

46:17.124 --> 46:19.626
I'm confident your suspicions
are wrong, Sergeant.

46:19.877 --> 46:24.381
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.

46:24.416 --> 46:25.883
Religious!

46:26.383 --> 46:30.387
With ruined churches,
no ministers, no priests...

46:30.422 --> 46:32.890
and children dancing naked.

46:40.030 --> 46:42.032
They do love
their divinity lessons.

46:42.067 --> 46:45.968
But they-they
are-are naked.

46:46.003 --> 46:47.473
Naturally. It's much too dangerous

46:47.508 --> 46:50.508
to jump through the fire
with your clothes on.

46:51.508 --> 46:55.512
What-what religion can-can-can
they possibly be learning...

46:55.547 --> 46:58.015
j- jumping over bonfires?

46:58.050 --> 47:00.535
Parthenogenesis.

47:00.570 --> 47:02.985
What?

47:03.020 --> 47:07.524
Literally, as Miss Rose would doubtless
say in her assiduous way,

47:07.559 --> 47:11.028
reproduction
without sexual union.

47:11.063 --> 47:13.495
Oh, what is all this?

47:13.530 --> 47:18.035
I mean, you-you-you've got
fake-fake-fake biology, fake religion.

47:18.070 --> 47:22.504
Sir, have these children
never heard of Jesus?

47:22.539 --> 47:28.545
Himself the son of a virgin, impregnated,
I believe, by a ghost.

47:29.546 --> 47:31.513
Do sit down, Sergeant.

47:31.548 --> 47:36.053
Shocks are so much better
absorbed with the knees bent.

47:36.088 --> 47:38.055
Please.

47:41.558 --> 47:43.810
Now, those children
out there,

47:43.845 --> 47:46.063
they're jumping
through the flames

47:46.563 --> 47:49.066
in the hope that the god of fire
will make them fruitful.

47:49.566 --> 47:51.068
Really, you can hardly
blame them.

47:51.568 --> 47:54.071
After all, what girl would not
prefer the child of a god

47:54.106 --> 47:57.074
to that of some
acne-scarred artisan?

47:57.574 --> 48:00.042
- And you, you encourage them in this?
- Actively.

48:00.077 --> 48:02.563
It's most important that each new
generation born on Summerisle

48:02.598 --> 48:06.066
be made aware that here
the old gods aren't dead.

48:06.316 --> 48:08.318
But what of the true god...

48:08.819 --> 48:10.821
to whose glory churches and
monasteries have been built

48:10.856 --> 48:13.323
on these islands
for generations past?

48:13.358 --> 48:15.541
Now sir, what of him?

48:15.576 --> 48:18.544
He's dead.
He can't complain.

48:18.579 --> 48:23.567
He had his chance, and in the
modern parlance, he blew it.

48:28.672 --> 48:30.674
- What?
- It's very simple.

48:30.924 --> 48:32.891
Let me show you.

48:32.926 --> 48:36.395
In the last century,
the islanders were starving.

48:36.430 --> 48:40.934
Like our neighbors today, they were
scratching a bare subsistence from sheep

48:41.068 --> 48:43.535
and sea.

48:43.570 --> 48:48.075
Then in 1868, my grandfather
bought this barren island

48:48.192 --> 48:50.159
and began to change things.

48:50.194 --> 48:54.665
A distinguished victorian scientist,
agronomist, free thinker.

48:56.166 --> 48:59.169
How formidably benevolent
he seems.

48:59.670 --> 49:03.674
Essentially the face of a man
incredulous of all human good.

49:03.709 --> 49:07.142
You are very cynical,
my lord.

49:07.177 --> 49:09.144
What attracted my
grandfather to the island,

49:09.179 --> 49:13.183
apart from the profuse source
of wiry labor that it promised,

49:13.684 --> 49:16.687
was the unique combination
of volcanic soil

49:16.937 --> 49:19.172
and the warm gulf stream
that surrounded it.

49:19.207 --> 49:21.373
You see, his experiments
had led him to believe

49:21.408 --> 49:23.410
that it was possible to induce
here the successful growth

49:23.911 --> 49:27.664
of certain new strains of fruit
that he had developed.

49:27.699 --> 49:30.810
So, with typical mid-victorian zeal,
he set to work.

49:30.845 --> 49:33.921
The best way of accomplishing
this, so it seemed to him,

49:34.421 --> 49:37.174
was to rouse the people
from their apathy...

49:37.209 --> 49:39.927
by giving them back
their joyous old gods,

49:39.962 --> 49:41.894
and as a result of
this worship,

49:41.929 --> 49:46.433
the barren island would burgeon and
bring forth fruit in great abundance.

49:46.468 --> 49:49.933
What he did, of course, was to develop
new cultivars of hardy fruits

49:49.968 --> 49:51.433
suited to local conditions.

49:51.439 --> 49:52.407
But, of course, to begin with,

49:52.442 --> 49:55.442
they worked for him because
he fed them and clothed them,

49:55.477 --> 49:57.442
but then later when the trees
starting fruiting,

49:57.477 --> 49:58.946
it became
a very different matter,

49:59.446 --> 50:02.353
and the ministers fled the island,
never to return.

50:02.388 --> 50:05.260
What my grandfather
had started out of expediency,

50:05.460 --> 50:08.260
My father continued out of... Love.

50:09.556 --> 50:11.523
He brought me up the same way -

50:11.558 --> 50:17.564
to reverence the music and the drama
and rituals of the old gods.

50:17.599 --> 50:22.034
To love nature and to fear it,

50:22.069 --> 50:24.571
and to rely on it and to
appease it where necessary.

50:25.072 --> 50:27.074
- He brought me up -
- He brought you up to be a pagan!

50:30.043 --> 50:34.047
A heathen, conceivably, but not,
I hope, an unenlightened one.

50:36.049 --> 50:39.419
Lord Summerisle, I am interested
in one thing: the law.

50:41.421 --> 50:44.925
But I must remind you, sir,
that despite everything you've said,

50:44.960 --> 50:48.428
you are the subject of a christian country.

50:50.430 --> 50:54.684
Now, sir, if I may have your permission
to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.

50:54.719 --> 50:58.939
I was under the impression I'd already given it to you.

50:59.439 --> 51:01.441
Ah, there's your transport.

51:01.942 --> 51:04.945
It's been a great pleasure
meeting a christian copper.

51:44.151 --> 51:47.763
There was a tinker lived of late

51:47.798 --> 51:51.204
Who walked the streets of Rhine.

51:51.239 --> 51:54.611
He bore his pack, upon his back

51:55.012 --> 51:57.779
Watches and plugs did cry

51:57.814 --> 52:00.817
Oh, I have brass within my bag

52:01.318 --> 52:04.286
My hammer's full of metal,

52:04.321 --> 52:07.591
And as to skill I work in clouts

52:07.991 --> 52:10.861
And mend a broken kettle.

52:12.646 --> 52:15.982
A maiden did this tinker meet

52:16.017 --> 52:19.319
And to him boldly say: "Oh, sure

52:19.720 --> 52:22.681
My kettle hath much need

52:22.716 --> 52:25.607
If you will pass my way. "

52:25.642 --> 52:29.913
She took the tinker by the hand

52:29.948 --> 52:32.848
And led him to her door.

52:32.883 --> 52:35.886
Says she "My kettle I will show,

52:35.921 --> 52:39.354
And you can clout it sure.

52:39.389 --> 52:45.278
For patching and plugging is his delight

52:48.398 --> 52:53.403
I found that in Rowan Morrison's grave.

52:57.908 --> 53:02.629
- Little Rowan loved the march hares.
- Hmm.

53:02.763 --> 53:04.765
It's sacrilege.

53:05.132 --> 53:10.387
Only if the ground is consecrated
to the christian belief.

53:10.422 --> 53:15.642
Personally, I think it makes
a very lovely transmutation.

53:16.143 --> 53:19.146
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?

53:19.646 --> 53:23.150
Miss, I hope you don't think that I can
be made a fool of indefinitely.

53:23.400 --> 53:26.403
Where is Rowan Morrison?

53:29.539 --> 53:32.425
Why, here she is - what
remains of her physically.

53:33.426 --> 53:35.894
Her soul, of course, may even now -

53:35.929 --> 53:39.432
Lord Summerisle, where is Rowan Morrison?

53:42.936 --> 53:45.904
Sergeant Howie, I think that...

53:45.939 --> 53:49.442
you are supposed to be the detective here.

53:56.449 --> 54:01.922
A child is reported missing on your island.

54:02.923 --> 54:06.892
At first I'm told there is no such child.

54:06.927 --> 54:10.931
I- I then - I then find that there is,
in fact, but that she has been killed.

54:10.966 --> 54:14.434
I subsequently discover that
there is no death certificate.

54:15.936 --> 54:18.939
and now I find that there is a grave.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.442
There's no body.

54:24.945 --> 54:27.447
Very perplexing for you.

54:29.950 --> 54:32.452
What do you think could have happened?

54:34.454 --> 54:39.083
I think Rowan Morrison was murdered...

54:39.118 --> 54:43.678
under circumstances of pagan barbarity,

54:43.713 --> 54:45.715
which I can scarcely bring myself to believe...

54:45.750 --> 54:48.218
as taking place in the 20th century.

54:50.220 --> 54:53.220
Now, it is my intention tomorrow
to return to the mainland...

54:53.255 --> 54:56.220
and report my suspicions
to the Chief Constable

54:56.255 --> 54:58.720
of the West Highland Constabulary.

54:59.029 --> 55:02.032
And I will demand a full inquiry takes place

55:02.067 --> 55:05.035
into the affairs of this heathen island.

55:07.237 --> 55:10.240
You must, of course, do as you see fit, Sergeant.

55:12.742 --> 55:16.245
Perhaps it's just as well that
you won't be here tomorrow,

55:16.280 --> 55:19.749
to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations here.

55:24.254 --> 55:27.757
Broome, would you kindly
show the Sergeant out?

55:27.792 --> 55:29.759
- This way, sir.
- Good-bye.

55:31.261 --> 55:34.764
Fair maid, says he, your kettle's cracked

55:34.799 --> 55:37.232
the cause is plainly told

55:37.267 --> 55:40.470
There hath so many nails been drove

55:40.505 --> 55:43.673
mine own could not take hold...

56:50.940 --> 56:53.443
There's hardly any produce.

56:55.445 --> 56:58.915
Well, that's it - the crops failed.

56:59.032 --> 57:04.037
And it's Rowan! Rowan and the crops failed!

57:08.325 --> 57:10.327
Now,

57:11.528 --> 57:14.731
what does the old religion say about crop failure?

57:16.416 --> 57:22.038
...to reverence the music,
the drama, the rituals of the old gods,

57:22.238 --> 57:25.206
to love nature and to fear it,

57:25.241 --> 57:28.728
to rely upon it and to
appease it when necessary.

57:29.729 --> 57:31.062
Sacrifice.

57:31.097 --> 57:33.882
Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here...

57:33.917 --> 57:38.421
to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations tomorrow.

57:42.909 --> 57:45.562
What if she's not dead?

57:50.233 --> 57:52.502
What if Rowan's not dead?

57:59.876 --> 58:01.845
Sergeant.

58:37.964 --> 58:42.702
Heigh ho

58:42.737 --> 58:47.440
Who is there

58:50.126 --> 58:52.128
No one but me

58:52.228 --> 58:55.231
My dear

58:55.266 --> 58:58.234
Please

58:58.735 --> 59:01.202
Come

59:01.237 --> 59:07.243
Say how do

59:07.744 --> 59:09.746
The things

59:09.863 --> 59:14.367
I'll give to you

59:14.868 --> 59:17.370
A stroke as gentle

59:17.405 --> 59:22.876
As a feather

59:23.259 --> 59:25.645
I'll catch a rainbow from the sky

59:26.045 --> 59:30.316
And tie the ends

59:30.351 --> 59:34.304
Together

59:38.741 --> 59:44.581
Heigh ho

59:44.681 --> 59:49.185
I am here

59:51.187 --> 59:54.190
Am I not young

59:54.225 --> 59:57.694
And fair

59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.696
Please

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:03.164
Come

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:07.386
Say how do

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:11.539
The things

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:15.595
I'll show to you

01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:21.317
Would you have

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:24.713
A wondrous sight

01:00:24.748 --> 01:00:28.163
Mmm hmm-hmm-mmm

01:00:28.198 --> 01:00:31.578
The midday Sun

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.084
At midnight

01:00:41.688 --> 01:00:46.734
Fair maid

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:51.781
White and red

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.935
Comb you smooth

01:00:56.336 --> 01:01:01.274
And stroke your head

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:07.372
Mmm mmm

01:01:07.407 --> 01:01:13.436
Mmm mmm-mmm

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:26.749
How a maid can milk a bull

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:32.772
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm

01:01:32.807 --> 01:01:36.768
And every stroke

01:01:36.803 --> 01:01:40.730
A bucket full

01:02:54.937 --> 01:03:06.983
We carry death out of the village!

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.869
We carry death out of the village!

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.373
"May Day festivals.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:18.878
"Primitive man lived and died by his harvest.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:23.383
"The purpose of his spring ceremonies
was to ensure a plentiful autumn.

01:03:23.418 --> 01:03:27.387
"Relics of these fertility dramas
are to be found all over Europe.

01:03:27.422 --> 01:03:29.389
"In Great Britain, for example, one can still see...

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:33.860
"harmless versions of them danced
in obscure villages on May Day.

01:03:33.895 --> 01:03:36.863
"Their cast includes many alarming characters:

01:03:36.898 --> 01:03:38.830
"A man-animal, or hobbyhorse,

01:03:38.865 --> 01:03:42.368
"who canters at the head of the
procession charging at the girls;

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:44.719
"A man-woman, the sinister teaser,

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.256
"played by the community leader or priest;

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.876
"And a man-fool, Punch,

01:03:50.376 --> 01:03:53.821
"most complex of all the symbolic figures -

01:03:53.856 --> 01:03:57.266
"the privileged simpleton and king for a day.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.268
"Six swordsmen follow these figures...

01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:02.021
"and at the climax of the ceremony
lock their swords together...

01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:03.988
"In a clear symbol of the Sun.

01:04:04.023 --> 01:04:08.528
"In pagan times, however, these dances
were not simply picturesque jigs.

01:04:09.028 --> 01:04:10.995
"They were frenzied rites ending in a sacrifice

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:15.535
"by which the dancers hoped desperately
to win over the goddess of the fields.

01:04:15.835 --> 01:04:19.038
"In good times, they offered produce
to the gods and slaughtered animals,

01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:23.209
"but in bad years, when the harvest had been poor,

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:27.228
"the sacrifice was a human being.

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:29.949
"In some cultures, it would be the king himself.

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:32.717
"In others, the most beloved virgin.

01:04:32.752 --> 01:04:37.173
"Very often he or she would be kept hidden
for months preceding the ceremony,

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.676
"just as the Sun is hidden
from the Earth in winter.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.465
Rowan's not dead!

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.517
"Methods of sacrifice differed.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:50.720
"Sometimes the victim would
be drowned in the sea...

01:04:50.755 --> 01:04:53.523
"or burnt to death in a huge sacrificial bonfire.

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:58.528
Sometimes the six swordsmen
ritually beheaded the virgin. "

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:01.030
Dear God in Heaven, even
these people can't be that mad.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:08.037
"The chief priest then skinned the child,

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:11.290
"and wearing the still-warmed skin like a mantle,

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:14.043
"led the rejoicing crowds through the streets.

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:19.013
"The priest thus represented the goddess reborn

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:23.052
and guaranteed another
successful harvest next year. "

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.676
Good morning, Sergeant!

01:05:30.711 --> 01:05:33.144
I need to get to my plane.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.298
Oh, well, on May Day,

01:05:35.548 --> 01:05:38.050
I'd better take you out myself.

01:05:43.556 --> 01:05:46.058
That's it.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.811
Here, right.

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.950
I shall be back shortly with
some more police officers.

01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:27.733
Have a good flight then!

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.618
Hey, you come back here!

01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:50.623
I said, come back here!

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:02.885
What's the matter? Won't she go?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.354
No. Has anyone been here?

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.391
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:12.495
If any of the children had been interfering
with it, I'm sure I would have seen-

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:15.498
I warn you: you're obstructing a police officer.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:20.334
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:23.122
You could maybe get old Sam there
to row you to the mainland.

01:07:23.157 --> 01:07:25.508
You'd be back in a week.

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:33.983
Well, I'll just have to find Rowan Morrison myself.

01:08:45.404 --> 01:08:47.406
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.

01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:55.413
Mr. Macgreagor, I trust we aren't going to

01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:57.381
have to let out your costume again this year.

01:08:57.416 --> 01:09:01.420
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does
seem to shrink a little each year.

01:09:01.455 --> 01:09:04.040
I know.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.518
My friends, enough now.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:22.524
We shall all reassemble outside
the town hall at 3:00 sharp...

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.028
and then process through the
village and the countryside,

01:09:26.063 --> 01:09:28.496
down to the beach below the stones,

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:31.499
by the route which has
become sacred to our rite.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:35.537
This year at the procession's end,
as has already been proclaimed,

01:09:35.573 --> 01:09:39.542
a holy sacrifice will be offered up jointly to Nuada,

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.642
our most sacred god of the Sun,

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:45.680
and to Avellenau, the beloved
goddess of our orchards,

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:49.685
in order that we may furnish
them with renewed power...

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.153
to quicken the growth of our crops.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.158
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!

01:09:56.193 --> 01:10:01.664
Hail the Queen of the May!

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:07.752
Why, Sergeant, I thought you'd gone back.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:11.791
Mrs. Morrison, I don't know if you know it or not,

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.793
But Rowan is not dead.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.796
- They've got her hidden somewhere.
- They?

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.800
Now, if you know where she is, I beg you
to tell me now before it's too late.

01:10:20.835 --> 01:10:23.302
- Sergeant, I've already told you -
- In the name of God, woman,

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.304
what kind of mother are you,

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.306
that can stand by and
see your own child slaughtered?

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:30.442
Sergeant, if I were you, I would
go back to the mainland.

01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:33.195
Stop interfering in things
that are no concern of yours.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:37.700
I am going to search every house in
this place during the next few hours.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.703
and if anybody, including you, stands in my way,

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:43.671
they'll be arrested as accomplices to murder.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:47.710
You'll simply never understand
the true nature of sacrifice.

01:10:50.462 --> 01:10:52.414
Heathens! Bloody heathens!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.467
Yes?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.505
- Take those masks off.
- No.

01:10:59.638 --> 01:11:01.640
Take them off!

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:05.978
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house...

01:11:06.478 --> 01:11:08.981
for a missing child.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:41.413
Baa baa black sheep,
Have you any wool

01:11:41.448 --> 01:11:46.735
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full

01:11:52.491 --> 01:11:54.493
I- I'm sorry.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.493
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.862
John Barleycorn.

01:13:19.897 --> 01:13:21.864
What's in here?

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:28.871
- What's that?
- That's my costume - the salmon of knowledge.

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:14.266
Hello. You're back early.

01:14:14.301 --> 01:14:17.234
Where are the other coppers?

01:14:17.269 --> 01:14:20.773
There aren't any. The plane wouldn't start.

01:14:24.777 --> 01:14:26.744
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.

01:14:26.779 --> 01:14:30.783
So he spent his time instead turning
the whole village upside down.

01:14:30.818 --> 01:14:35.287
- Just give me a glass of whiskey.
- No wonder he's worn out.

01:14:35.322 --> 01:14:38.290
Did you find the girl?

01:14:38.791 --> 01:14:42.760
No, well, I can't say I'm very surprised.

01:14:42.795 --> 01:14:45.297
I'm going to rest in my bed
for half an hour.

01:14:45.332 --> 01:14:47.765
I do not wish to be disturbed.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.053
I'd stay there until tonight, if I was you.

01:14:51.088 --> 01:14:54.306
We don't much relish strangers around today.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.114
He's asleep.

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:06.368
I don't like to use it on him, really.

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.371
The laird said we're to take no chances, didn't he?

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:13.375
I know, but with the Hand of Glory there's
no telling when you wake.

01:15:13.410 --> 01:15:15.843
He might sleep for days.
- All the better.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:21.383
- Shh!
- We don't want him butting in. Go on, light it up.

01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:47.292
That will make you sleep, my pretty Sergeant.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:56.301
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:00.272
You best get on ahead.

01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:02.307
They've given you girls five
minutes start, haven't they?

01:16:02.342 --> 01:16:04.309
Good-bye.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:25.974
What's the matter with you, Macgreagor?
Do you call that dancing?

01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:29.361
Cut some capers, man. Use your bladder.

01:17:29.861 --> 01:17:32.481
Play the fool. That's what you're here for.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.985
I suppose you've been getting
drunk at your own bar.

01:18:34.893 --> 01:18:36.895
That's more like it!

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:40.282
Good, good!

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:16.945
Here comes the job, that you chop off your head!

01:20:17.195 --> 01:20:20.198
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:25.570
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

01:20:53.031 --> 01:20:57.536
Everyone must go through, Macgreagor.
It's a game of chance, remember.

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:35.674
It's Holly. Well done.

01:21:41.179 --> 01:21:45.183
Now, my friends, to the beach.

01:22:01.867 --> 01:22:04.870
O god of the sea,

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:07.873
I offer you this ale as a libation,

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:12.936
that you may bestow upon us
in the year to come

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:17.749
the rich and diverse fruits of your kingdom.

01:22:22.254 --> 01:22:25.757
Hail, god of the seas!

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.760
Accept our offering!

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:40.030
And now, for our more dreadful sacrifice...

01:22:40.065 --> 01:22:43.909
yo those who command the fruit of the Earth.

01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:55.787
It's Rowan.

01:23:00.792 --> 01:23:03.295
What's the matter, Mr. Macgreagor?

01:23:04.296 --> 01:23:06.263
Now, don't be frightened. I'm a police officer.

01:23:06.298 --> 01:23:09.184
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, mister, please.

01:23:09.301 --> 01:23:12.804
- I don't like it here. They're coming.
Do you know what they're gonna do?

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:15.056
- They're going to -
- Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!

01:23:19.311 --> 01:23:21.813
We can escape through the cave. I know the way.

01:23:26.818 --> 01:23:28.820
Quickly.

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:45.470
That's the way out up there.

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:57.432
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.290
We seem to have lost our torch-bearing friends.

01:24:14.325 --> 01:24:16.751
I'm sorry.
It was worse than I remembered it.

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:34.152
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.

01:24:34.187 --> 01:24:38.023
Dear little Rowan.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.417
Rowan, darling. Come on, now.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.310
Welcome, fool.

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:20.815
You have come of your own
free will to the appointed place.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:23.835
The game is over.

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.786
Game? What game?

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.324
The game of the hunted leading the hunter.

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:33.293
You came here to find Rowan Morrison,

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:36.796
but it is we who have found you
and brought you here

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:40.835
and controlled your every thought
and action since you arrived.

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:44.839
Principally, we persuaded you to think

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:48.095
that Rowan Morrison was
being held as a sacrifice

01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.060
because our crops failed last year.

01:25:50.095 --> 01:25:52.597
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:56.985
Oh, yes. They failed, all right, disastrously so...

01:25:57.102 --> 01:26:01.106
for the first time since my grandfather came here.

01:26:01.606 --> 01:26:05.110
The blossom came but the fruit
withered and died on the bough.

01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:09.579
That must not happen again this year.

01:26:09.614 --> 01:26:13.359
It is our most earnest belief that the
best way of preventing this

01:26:13.394 --> 01:26:17.105
is to offer to our god of the Sun and
to the goddess of our orchards

01:26:17.222 --> 01:26:21.726
the most acceptable sacrifice
that lies in our power.

01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:26.196
Animals are fine, but their acceptability is limited.

01:26:26.231 --> 01:26:30.235
A little child is even better,
but not nearly as effective

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:34.105
as the right kind of adult.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:36.573
What do you mean,

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:39.110
"right kind of adult"?

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:46.251
You, Sergeant, are the right kind of adult,

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:49.621
as our painstaking researches have revealed.

01:26:49.656 --> 01:26:54.375
You, uniquely, were the one we needed.

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.511
A man who would come
here of his own free will.

01:26:56.895 --> 01:27:01.649
A man who has come here with the power
of a king by representing the law.

01:27:01.766 --> 01:27:03.768
A man who would come here as a virgin.

01:27:04.269 --> 01:27:06.271
A man who has come here as a fool.

01:27:09.274 --> 01:27:12.277
Get out of my way.

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:40.737
You are the fool, Mr. Howie -

01:27:40.772 --> 01:27:46.277
Punch, one of the great fool-victims of history,

01:27:46.778 --> 01:27:51.766
for you have accepted the role of king for a day,

01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:55.735
and who but a fool would do that?

01:27:55.770 --> 01:28:00.642
But you will be revered and anointed as a king.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:11.903
You will undergo death and rebirth -

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:14.504
resurrection, if you like.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:17.041
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours,

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:19.544
but that of our crops.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:23.513
I am a christian,

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:27.552
and as a Christian, I hope for resurrection.

01:28:27.587 --> 01:28:30.322
And even if you kill me now,

01:28:30.357 --> 01:28:33.057
it is I who will live again,

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.060
not your damned apples.

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:40.940
Sleep

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:46.981
Close and fast

01:29:52.203 --> 01:29:54.956
No matter what you do,

01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:57.709
you can't change the fact

01:29:58.209 --> 01:30:00.176
that I believe in the life eternal,

01:30:00.211 --> 01:30:02.714
as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.

01:30:03.214 --> 01:30:07.183
I believe in the life eternal

01:30:07.218 --> 01:30:11.222
as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.

01:30:11.257 --> 01:30:13.224
That is good.

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.942
For believing what you do,

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:20.481
we confer upon you
a rare gift these days -

01:30:20.516 --> 01:30:22.483
a martyr's death.

01:30:22.867 --> 01:30:26.669
You will not only have life eternal,

01:30:26.704 --> 01:30:30.208
but you will sit with
the saints among the elect.

01:30:31.209 --> 01:30:33.711
Come.

01:30:34.212 --> 01:30:37.715
It is time to keep your appointment
with The Wicker Man.

01:30:38.716 --> 01:30:41.684
Now, wait!

01:30:41.719 --> 01:30:44.472
Now, all of you, just wait and listen to me.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.974
And you can wrap it up any way you like.

01:30:47.009 --> 01:30:49.977
You are about to commit murder.

01:30:50.228 --> 01:30:54.232
Can you not see? There is no Sun god.

01:30:54.732 --> 01:30:58.736
There is no goddess of the fields.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.210
Your crops failed because your strains failed.

01:31:07.245 --> 01:31:10.748
Fruit is not meant to be grown on these islands.
It's against nature.

01:31:11.249 --> 01:31:16.003
Don't you see that killing me is not
going to bring back your apples?

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:20.758
Summerisle, you know it won't.
Go on, man. Tell them. Tell them it won't.

01:31:20.793 --> 01:31:24.228
I know it will.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:29.483
Well, don't you understand that
if your crops fail this year,

01:31:29.518 --> 01:31:33.202
next year you're going to have to
have another blood sacrifice?

01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:37.125
And next year, no one less than the
king of Summerisle himself will do.

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:39.575
If the crops fail, Summerisle,

01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:44.599
next year your people
will kill you on May Day.

01:31:44.634 --> 01:31:47.066
They will not fail.

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:50.104
The sacrifice of the willing king,

01:31:50.139 --> 01:31:53.107
like virgin fool, will be accepted.

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.610
But don't you see I'll be missed?

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.614
- They'll come looking for me.
- There will be no traces. Bring him up, Oak.

01:31:59.649 --> 01:32:01.616
- Go on.
- No!

01:32:01.866 --> 01:32:05.620
Think! Just think what you're doing!

01:32:05.655 --> 01:32:08.623
Think what you're doing! Think!

01:32:08.873 --> 01:32:12.376
In the name of God, think what you're doing!

01:32:33.097 --> 01:32:36.100
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:32:40.605 --> 01:32:44.457
Oh, my God! Christ!

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:48.996
No, no, dear God!
No, Christ!

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:49.307
No, no!

01:33:56.931 --> 01:34:02.320
Mighty god of the Sun,
bountiful goddess of our orchards,

01:34:02.687 --> 01:34:07.575
accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:10.077
Mighty god of the Sun,

01:34:10.328 --> 01:34:14.832
bountiful goddess of our orchards...
- Hear ye the words of the lord!

01:34:14.867 --> 01:34:18.338
...accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.

01:34:18.339 --> 01:34:20.339
Awake, ye heathens, and hold!

01:34:21.839 --> 01:34:26.309
It is the Lord who hath laid waste your orchards!

01:34:26.344 --> 01:34:29.597
It is he who hath made them bare!
- Reverence the sacrifice.

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.498
Hold, ye husbandmen,

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:35.469
because the harvest of
your field hath perished

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.406
and the vine is dried up

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:41.457
and the apple tree languisheth!

01:34:41.492 --> 01:34:44.695
Even all the trees of the field are withered

01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:48.165
because the truth is withered away

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.312
from the sons of men.

01:34:52.347 --> 01:34:56.424
Desire shall fail

01:34:56.791 --> 01:35:00.294
and ye shall all die

01:35:00.329 --> 01:35:02.797
accursed!

01:35:34.245 --> 01:35:38.249
Summer is a-comin' in

01:35:38.382 --> 01:35:42.351
Loudly sing cuckoo

01:35:42.386 --> 01:35:46.007
Grows the seed and blows the mead

01:35:46.257 --> 01:35:51.612
And springs the wood anew

01:35:51.647 --> 01:35:57.234
Sing cuckoo

01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:00.429
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb

01:36:00.464 --> 01:36:03.374
Cows after calves make moo

01:36:11.382 --> 01:36:14.885
The lord's my shepherd

01:36:15.386 --> 01:36:18.572
I'll not want

01:36:18.607 --> 01:36:21.759
He takes me down

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:25.012
to lie

01:36:25.262 --> 01:36:27.765
in pastures -

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.900
Oh, God.

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:36.157
Grows the seed and blows the mead

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:41.779
And springs the wood anew

01:36:44.281 --> 01:36:47.635
- Sing cuckoo
- Oh, God.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:54.141
I humbly entreat you for the soul
of this, thy servant, Neil Howie...

01:36:56.143 --> 01:37:00.613
who will today depart from this world.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:05.152
Do not deliver me into the enemy's hands...

01:37:05.653 --> 01:37:11.158
or put me out of mind forever.

01:37:14.745 --> 01:37:20.251
Let me not undergo the real pains of hell,
dear God, because I die unshriven

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:23.637
- Cuckoo, cuckoo
- and establish me

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:26.605
in that bliss

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.642
which knows no ending,

01:37:28.893 --> 01:37:32.146
- Cuckoo
- through Christ,

01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:34.980
our lord.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:38.903
Grows the seed and blows the mead

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:42.273
Failure! Failure!

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:51.782
Sing cuckoo

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:56.161
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb

01:37:56.196 --> 01:37:59.686
Cows after calves make moo

01:37:59.721 --> 01:38:03.177
Bullock stamps and deer champs

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:07.181
Now shrilly sing cuckoo

01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:10.985
Cuckoo, cuckoo

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:14.720
Wild bird are you

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:18.876
Be never still, cuckoo

01:38:19.305 --> 01:38:25.718
