Michele!

02:15.552 --> 02:16.678
[sighs]

02:19.473 --> 02:20.849
[Ezequiel] That room is empty.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.977
Hello. Please...

02:25.020 --> 02:27.689
Good morning. Ezequiel, right?

02:27.773 --> 02:30.817
-Michele used to sleep here--
-She has been eliminated.

02:30.901 --> 02:35.238
What? There must be a misunderstanding.
She passed the individual test.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.783
-She was at the feast--
-The candidate was eliminated.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.619
We found inconsistencies
with her registration.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.455
She was taken to the gates
a few minutes ago.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.377
None of you noticed any odd behavior?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.547
You didn't find anything off about her?

02:52.631 --> 02:54.549
-No.
-No.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.222
Let's not worry about it, Fernando.
You're almost to the Offshore.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.858
Ezequiel!

03:16.530 --> 03:17.739
[Fernando exhales]

03:19.241 --> 03:20.367
I'd like to quit.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.495
What did you say?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.249
I'd like to quit.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.461
Have you lost your mind?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.133
You made it this far. Very few do.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.803
Why do you want to quit?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.513
I'm sorry, but I want to leave now.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.559
Then come with me.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.153
[groans]

03:59.948 --> 04:02.576
CONGRATULATIONS, JOANA!

[laughing]

04:26.057 --> 04:28.727
-Fernando, are you sure about this?
-Yes.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.986
[panting]

04:40.530 --> 04:41.448
Michele.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.702
Michele.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.664
Michele.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.759
Michele? Michele?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.719
Michele! Michele!

05:02.803 --> 05:04.387
-Hi, Fernando.
-Hey.

05:05.013 --> 05:09.017
Congratulations. The test you created
was very interesting.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.187
-It's a pity you've been eliminated.
-Yes, because I quit.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.900
You've shown resistance to the Process
since the Survival stage.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.613
-But it was your own test that got you.
-Look, I'm quitting because I want to.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.865
Because Michele was eliminated.
Wasn't she?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.953
It's a shame that your motivation
to pass wasn't strong enough.

05:28.036 --> 05:28.870
What?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.832
-Instructions for your recovery...
-Where's Michele?

05:31.915 --> 05:34.543
-I wanna talk to her. Wait!
-Try not to reminisce

05:34.626 --> 05:37.671
-or talk about what happened here.
-Where is she? Where's Michele?

05:37.754 --> 05:42.217
Where is she? Open up! Michele!

05:42.884 --> 05:44.261
Michele!

05:46.930 --> 05:48.348
Michele!

06:06.533 --> 06:07.701
[grunting]

06:11.997 --> 06:13.456
[Ezequiel]
Get her out of there!

06:14.291 --> 06:16.209
[gasps, coughs]

06:17.627 --> 06:19.045
Get her out, right now!

06:19.546 --> 06:21.590
[Michele coughing, gasping]

06:25.594 --> 06:28.054
[Ezequiel]
What have they done to you?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.224
You're dismissed.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.893
No, please. No.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.334
Cássia and I have suspected you
from the start.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.251
[coughs]

06:58.335 --> 07:01.254
Your friend Bruna
didn't really fit the profile.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.716
[groaning]

07:06.760 --> 07:08.720
Why do you want to kill me?

07:11.765 --> 07:12.807
Hm?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.687
-Why so much anger?
-[gasps]

07:19.397 --> 07:21.274
Why so much anger, Michele?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.160
I'm here to protect you.
I just want to talk to you.

07:34.788 --> 07:39.167
You try to kill me,
murder one of my agents...

07:42.003 --> 07:46.424
César was very dear to us, Michele.
If the other agents find out,

07:46.508 --> 07:49.302
-they'll want your head.
-[sobbing]

07:51.888 --> 07:55.141
And me? What do you think
I might want from you, Michele?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.144
In exchange for not
eliminating you right now?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.688
[sobs]

08:04.234 --> 08:05.360
[sighs]

08:05.443 --> 08:06.736
Help me out, please.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.614
Tell me...

08:10.949 --> 08:12.659
why do you want to kill me?

08:21.084 --> 08:24.963
Look, Michele, I'm not leaving
until you give me an answer.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.216
[shouts] Tell me!

08:33.179 --> 08:36.057
You... killed my brother.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.852
You killed... my brother.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.523
-I killed your brother?
-[sobs]

08:44.149 --> 08:47.152
And you're seeking revenge? Is that it?

09:05.962 --> 09:06.963
Go on.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.387
[man]
<i>I... I'd like to apologize.</i>

09:17.140 --> 09:20.435
<i>I came very close. I did my best,</i>
<i>but on my individual test--</i>

09:20.518 --> 09:23.021
[Ivana]
<i>Don't worry about it. You did your best.</i>

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
<i>And the Cause acknowledges that.</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:29.360
<i>But the fight must go on</i>
<i>and that's why you're here now.</i>

09:35.200 --> 09:39.537
[older man]
Can you tell us if any of these agents...

09:40.413 --> 09:42.290
made it to the last stage?

09:52.926 --> 09:56.638
-Her?
-I saw her going into an individual room.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.931
Near the end.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.474
I think she's still in.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.227
Anyone else?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.275
Yes... but I never would've guessed
he was one of us, too.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.490
Thank you, comrade.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.159
[Ivana] We'll find you soon
for your next mission.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.538
For now, the fight goes on.
For the Cause.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.455
For the Cause.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.254
Two! Can you believe it?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.714
Yes. Finally, we did it!

10:36.386 --> 10:38.763
Her... I recruited her.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.017
She was a lot of trouble. A lot.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.228
Jorge didn't trust her...

10:46.312 --> 10:48.064
but it all worked out in the end.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.650
She was confident.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.573
Now, this boy, he wasn't in my group.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.367
I don't know what to expect from him.

11:02.829 --> 11:07.750

11:34.944 --> 11:36.696
[birds calling]

11:43.494 --> 11:44.746
I'm sorry about César.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.832
It's time to get on with your new lives.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.418
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

[all chattering excitedly]

12:08.186 --> 12:11.064
Come on, Joana!
What are you waiting for?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.084
-Mm!
-[chuckles]

12:32.752 --> 12:33.628
Copycat.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.587
Joana.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.090
Have you seen Fernando?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.594
He and Michele haven't shown up,
so I don't know.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.181
Is there a problem?

12:45.807 --> 12:47.642
I don't know what you said to Fernando,

12:47.725 --> 12:49.560
but if it were up to me
you wouldn't be here.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.356
Ha. Yeah, but I am still here.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.566
In fact, I'm in the Purification with you.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.403
So, if we're gonna live in the same place,

12:58.486 --> 13:02.782
if our families are gonna be neighbors,
if my kids are gonna play with yours...

13:03.366 --> 13:06.369
maybe you should start looking at me
in a different light.

13:13.167 --> 13:17.213
-Joana. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.967
There's a lot to purify,
but it's just a matter of time.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.680
Ezequiel would like to have a word
with you. Come with me?

13:26.556 --> 13:27.640
Only me?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.351
It's a routine chat.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.293
Hello! Is anybody there?

13:56.502 --> 13:59.922
[man] You have to stay in your room
until the transportation to Offshore!

14:00.673 --> 14:01.507
Please!

14:01.591 --> 14:05.511
Please, open the door! Please!
I know I was wrong! I do!

14:05.595 --> 14:08.598
-Calm down. You need to stay here.
-Listen, listen, listen.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.768
I need to ask the widow's forgiveness.
You know her name? Luciana.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.062
Ask her to come here.
I need her forgiveness.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.856
-Calm down.
-Please! I know I was wrong!

14:24.864 --> 14:25.740
Why?

14:26.783 --> 14:29.160
Why do you think I killed your brother?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.167
[soft gasp]
He was with the Cause.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.922
Your brother, André Santana,
was with the Cause?

14:43.174 --> 14:44.384
That's unlikely.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.638
But even more unlikely is that someone
who was tortured and killed by me...

14:50.431 --> 14:53.976
could pose for a photo on the Offshore
in such a lively manner.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.480
André Santana.

15:02.985 --> 15:03.820
No.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.823
Doesn't he look a little older to you?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.700
-I'd say...
-That's not real.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.413
-...about five years after his "death."
-No.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.708
Your brother was never with the Cause.

15:17.792 --> 15:21.337
He went to the Offshore after
the first Process I led five years ago.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.464
-That's a lie.
-That's the truth.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.508
[sobs] No!

15:29.095 --> 15:31.222
That's how they recruited you, right?

15:32.974 --> 15:38.896
"Join the Cause to avenge the death
of innocents and end segregation."

15:39.981 --> 15:43.484
-They trained you hard for five years.
-[sobbing]

15:43.568 --> 15:45.987
They indoctrinated you,
made you see things...

15:51.617 --> 15:53.411
all in the name of a lie.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.039
Who recruited you?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.332
[groans]

16:02.295 --> 16:03.171
Tell me.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.132
[spits, groans]

16:07.467 --> 16:11.512
Was it the person who told you exactly
how I tortured your brother?

16:11.596 --> 16:12.763
How I killed him?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.352
Because that is a recruitment technique
made up by an old man.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.314
-[coughing]
-A resentful and hateful old man...

16:22.273 --> 16:26.277
who seeks everyone's pity
from behind a wooden mask.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.113
I know him well.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.076
When we used to meet,
he didn't always wear the hood.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.133
I was with the Cause, Michele.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.934
But, thankfully,
I left that childish ideology...

16:58.726 --> 16:59.977
a long time ago.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.319
You believe you're fighting against
the world's injustices

17:09.403 --> 17:12.406
and that by destroying the Process,
you will find equality.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.494
But the truth is that
there are no heroes or villains.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.707
No inequality or injustice.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.337
Because we know there is
only one difference between people:

17:28.422 --> 17:33.344
those who have merit
and those who do not. Period.

17:38.933 --> 17:39.934
Look.

17:41.352 --> 17:45.356
This old man who destroyed your life...
it's him I want.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.609
Tell me where to find him...

17:49.944 --> 17:51.487
and I'll consider letting you go.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.200
-I won't talk.
-Michele.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.286
I won't... talk.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.456
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.960
I'll leave you and your brother
alone for a while.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.503

<i>Can't I do that in peace? Stop, seriously.</i>

18:25.980 --> 18:29.859

<i>Especially now!</i>

<i>Corruption is all people worry about.</i>

19:36.092 --> 19:39.011
-Nair...
<i>-And those who think that you--</i>

19:39.095 --> 19:43.432
Calm down. I appreciate what you're doing,
but I ask you to remain calm and trust me.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.975
<i>Trust you?</i>

19:45.059 --> 19:48.020
<i>How, Ezequiel,</i>
<i>when you leave during the Process</i>

19:48.104 --> 19:50.981
<i>only to be seen with a child</i>
<i>in the Inland?</i>

19:52.024 --> 19:54.735
-So, you know.
<i>-Of course I know.</i>

19:54.819 --> 20:00.741
<i>You ask me to switch Aline's report</i>
<i>and you think I won't look at it first?</i>

20:00.825 --> 20:02.451
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

20:03.160 --> 20:06.330
<i>It's insane, Ezequiel.</i>
<i>Helping Julia's son?</i>

20:07.373 --> 20:11.919
[stammers] It...
It was a moment of weakness.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.714
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>because of our friendship.</i>

20:14.797 --> 20:17.675
<i>But that stops now.</i>
<i>I'm not supporting you anymore.</i>

20:17.758 --> 20:20.010
-Nair...
<i>-Our communication ceases here.</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:22.888
Nair, you're the only one I trust.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.891
-The only one!
<i>-Too bad I can't say the same.</i>

20:44.535 --> 20:46.412
They said you wanted to ask forgiveness.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.125
Not exactly,
but I need you to listen to me.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.586
It wasn't me.

20:55.171 --> 20:59.467
-I can't deal with you right now.
-No, please. Why would I kill César?

20:59.550 --> 21:00.593
Why?

21:02.553 --> 21:09.393
Ezequiel... had to get rid of me.
He fabricated this lie.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.481
I swear. I swear!

21:13.564 --> 21:15.316
I swear, it wasn't me! It wasn't me!

21:15.399 --> 21:18.778
Aline, if you're going to keep lying,
why did you call me here?

21:18.861 --> 21:23.199
Because I know it's just as important
to you as it is to me

21:23.282 --> 21:26.243
to find out what really happened
last night.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.040
For Ezequiel and the Council,
this was just a political issue.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.459
They already dealt with it. By using me.

21:34.335 --> 21:38.756
But you and I need to find out
what really happened.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.430
Close the door, please.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.600
[door closes]

21:52.269 --> 21:55.022
I'm sorry for my tardiness,
my dear chosen ones.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.732
Please, come closer.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.363
You are here for the Purification ritual.

22:02.446 --> 22:07.660
Purification serves to cleanse you
of a great evil of society.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.331
The vaccine will sterilize you.

22:12.915 --> 22:17.294
-What?
-I'm sure you must be wondering why.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.588
So was I, over 20 years ago,

22:19.672 --> 22:23.259
before I learned to look at the world
the right way.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.512
I'll never have children?

22:26.595 --> 22:32.101
Not me. Not you. No one. None of us.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.145
No way.
There are no kids on the Offshore?

22:35.229 --> 22:40.568
We don't have kids on the Offshore
precisely because heredity...

22:41.569 --> 22:47.032
was the biggest injustice that sustained
the outrageous world we lived in.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.288
That was the Founding Couple's
biggest accomplishment.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.998
Their greatest lesson.

22:55.916 --> 23:00.546
They were the first to not bear children.
And they taught us...

23:01.422 --> 23:06.218
that the true path
to building a superior society...

23:08.387 --> 23:09.221
is merit.

23:14.643 --> 23:18.022
And the only way to evaluate true merit...

23:19.106 --> 23:20.733
is through the Process.

23:23.110 --> 23:27.573
Because you will know for certain
that you've earned these privileges.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.035
You fought for them and deserve them.

23:31.994 --> 23:38.375
So, there is no room for doubt,
guilt, melancholy.

23:38.792 --> 23:39.752
No.

23:43.339 --> 23:48.677
And now... it is my pleasure
to be among you.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.056
Among the future.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.821
You... are the real children
of the Offshore.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.871
If anyone would like to quit now...

24:17.456 --> 24:18.749
please inform Bernardo.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.836
If you'd like to continue on...

24:26.006 --> 24:30.803
simply follow this path...
where you will undergo your Purification.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.692
I hope you make the right decision.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.910
-What the fuck?
-He's right.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.828
Right?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.663
-Yes, he's right.
-You don't care?

24:57.746 --> 25:00.541
About not having kids?
Being sterilized? What the hell?

25:00.624 --> 25:02.918
I never wanted to have kids. Fuck it.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.630
We can still have sex.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.258
And not have to worry about it.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.763
Later, guys.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.284
[device whirring]

25:35.617 --> 25:38.287

Welcome to the three percent!

[applause]

25:49.131 --> 25:50.090
[Cássia] Joana?

25:51.133 --> 25:54.470
Ezequiel is dealing with some things
and he'll be with you in a minute.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.765
Am I the only one
going through this confirmation?

25:57.848 --> 26:02.436
I would look at it more like a privilege
than an actual test.

26:03.604 --> 26:07.357
I also had to go through this confirmation
when I became head of security.

26:08.984 --> 26:12.613
Ezequiel must have seen
some special quality in you.

26:13.947 --> 26:17.159
As he saw in me, at the time.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.789
Trust him. He has his reasons.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.804
<i>Stop filming me, I'm using the restroom.</i>
<i>Can I do this in peace?</i>

26:36.887 --> 26:38.889
<i>Stop it. Stop. I'm serious.</i>

26:40.182 --> 26:42.309
-[recording continues looping]
-[door opens]

26:47.481 --> 26:50.025
-I want to see my brother.
-I can make that happen.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.904
-I wanna see my brother, right now!
-But first you have to do your part.

26:54.738 --> 27:00.202
Think about it. That old son of a bitch
put you in this situation.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.123
Between you and me, who's the real killer?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.501
I didn't kill your brother.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.336
But you...

27:10.879 --> 27:12.840
you must be feeling pretty guilty.

27:13.924 --> 27:17.928
First Bruna, a totally innocent girl.
Then, César.

27:19.388 --> 27:24.017
Truth be told, Michele, those deaths
weren't your fault. You were manipulated.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.897
And I'm offering a chance for redemption.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.233
Forgiveness for your murders.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.151
Think carefully, Michele.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.573
All you need to do is tell me
how you'd meet with him...

27:38.949 --> 27:42.244
if you were eliminated
and had to return to the Inland.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.787
That's all.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.083

[applause]

28:22.451 --> 28:26.705
You came here to get revenge,
which will never be a form of justice.

28:27.456 --> 28:31.251
What I'm giving you right now
is the opportunity to bring to justice

28:31.335 --> 28:33.503
the real villain in this story.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.137
Easy. Calm down, relax.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.514
You made it this far,
you can't give up now.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.726
You have the chance
for a better life on the Offshore.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.311
Trust us. Go on.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.317
You're going, too?

28:55.984 --> 28:57.236
Yes.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.740
[Ezequiel]
<i>Free yourself. Come on, Michele.</i>

29:01.823 --> 29:04.117
Take advantage of this and free yourself.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.667
Rafael, you can't just think of yourself.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.298
-I want a better life for my children.
-You know nothing about children.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.221
<i>Come on, come on, Michele!</i>

29:24.304 --> 29:27.557
Free yourself from this guilt!
Free yourself, Michele.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.436
It's about everyone's children,
not just yours.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.315
Come on, Michele,
take this opportunity and free yourself!

29:38.151 --> 29:41.822
If I was eliminated,
I was supposed to meet him...

29:59.673 --> 30:03.927
-If the four caps are grouped together...
-If the four caps are grouped together...

30:07.723 --> 30:08.849
...you'll find him.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.647
Where?

30:16.982 --> 30:17.899
Tell me where.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.156
-[woman] Rafael!

[cheering]

31:29.596 --> 31:31.681
Welcome to the three percent, Michele.

31:37.646 --> 31:41.191
Anyone else in my place
would have killed you.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.279
Why didn't you?

31:46.363 --> 31:49.658
Michele, I've been in your shoes,
exactly where you are.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.494
And I only came this far

31:52.577 --> 31:56.498
because I've been on both sides
and chose the right one.

31:57.624 --> 32:01.670
Only someone who's been through that
can be certain of their convictions.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.006
Someone like me. And like you.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.429
I'm taking you to the Offshore.

32:10.512 --> 32:13.932
I'll admit you into
the Recovery and Treatment Center

32:14.015 --> 32:17.310
and I will personally supervise
your progress.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.816
And every once in a while,
I'll bring your brother.

32:24.901 --> 32:28.613
Now, tell me... who else do you know?

32:29.448 --> 32:32.451
-Just the old man.
-And inside the Process?

32:33.160 --> 32:36.538
Apart from you, is there any other
infiltrator from the Cause?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.877
-No.
-I know there's someone else.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.007
-Michele, you better tell me now.
-There's no one else.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.635
-You will regret this later.
-There is no one else.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.397
I wanted to leave a better world
for my kids.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.941
But Ezequiel's words made sense,

33:05.025 --> 33:08.403
and I'll leave a better world
for the children of the Offshore.

33:08.904 --> 33:09.738
All right.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.387
Hello, Joana.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.433
-Hi. Is everything okay?
-Yes.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.521
Relax. Have a seat, please.

33:47.651 --> 33:50.195
I just want to confirm
your full abilities.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.907
It's a test.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.371
But it's only because I think
you can be more than

33:59.454 --> 34:01.957
just an ordinary citizen on the Offshore.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.460
You've followed the path of a warrior,

34:05.544 --> 34:08.045
and I see tremendous potential in you.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.592
I resorted to this strategy
because the Offshore is in great danger.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.219
Danger?

34:15.679 --> 34:19.266
Our citizens must understand
the difference between us...

34:20.766 --> 34:21.976
and them.

34:57.637 --> 35:01.433
When he came to the Process,
he was eliminated on the first interview.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.271
A model citizen from the Offshore...

35:08.523 --> 35:11.735
cannot have inappropriate feelings
toward them.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.974
for all that you suffered
in this filthy and corrupt world.

I was wrong, then.
I'm ashamed to have bet on you.

but you can't.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.866
Sometimes it may seem like it, but no.

-Trash.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.587
-I'm trash?
-Yes.

38:59.671 --> 39:04.551
Look at you. Telling me the Offshore
was made for people like me.

39:04.634 --> 39:08.137
No. It was made for people like you!

than everyone else.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.938

A piece of shit!

to play king with.

-Get out.

There isn't an ounce of humanity
left in you.

-Get out.
-You are trash.

Get out!
Before I put you in that chair! Go!

39:46.843 --> 39:48.011
I don't think so.

39:49.554 --> 39:53.558
Joana? You know very well that
candidates aren't allowed in here.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.643
I'm not a candidate.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.229
Nine-six-one.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.782
[panting] Michele?

40:11.284 --> 40:13.369
Michele. Michele.

40:20.543 --> 40:24.255
Joana, have you seen Michele?
Do you know where she is? Did she pass?

40:24.339 --> 40:28.134
She must have passed.
The Process just wants the worst ones.

40:28.217 --> 40:31.387
I thought you had passed, too,
that everything had gone well.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.348
-What happened?
-No one on the Offshore

40:33.431 --> 40:35.725
cares about anyone in the Inland.

40:35.808 --> 40:38.645
That's how it's always been
and that's how it will always be.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.563
Until someone does something about it.

40:41.147 --> 40:41.981
Yeah.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.859
Let's go, Fernando. It'll be dark soon.

40:44.943 --> 40:48.237
No, I'm staying. I have to wait
for Michele. I won't leave without her.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.824
That's not going to happen.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.829
Let's go.

40:56.913 --> 40:57.830
Come on.

41:04.796 --> 41:09.008
[Daniel] This is for my aunt.
She didn't believe in me, but I'm here.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.720
I'm alive, right here.
People don't seem excited, huh?

41:12.804 --> 41:14.347
Let's party. Have a drink.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.131
Is everyone there?

42:07.525 --> 42:08.735
[sighs]

42:16.284 --> 42:17.910
[giggling]

42:19.579 --> 42:21.497
[laughing]

42:33.551 --> 42:35.553
[both continue laughing]

42:52.737 --> 42:57.658
Zé! Zé! Look who's heading down.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.454
Wheels and that other girl.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.373
They already made it back!

43:05.500 --> 43:08.544
Hello! Welcome!

43:08.628 --> 43:10.421
[cackling]

43:17.887 --> 43:21.224
Just letting you know
we're closing up for next year,

43:21.307 --> 43:23.893
and the selected candidates
are ready for transport.

43:23.976 --> 43:24.977
Okay.

43:25.603 --> 43:29.982
And also, to ask you about Joana...
I'm curious.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.449
Excuse me.

43:53.714 --> 43:57.176
-The Founding Couple is coming!
-[all] Amen!

43:57.260 --> 44:03.724
They will return. Yes, they will return
to show that the Process is the only way!

44:03.808 --> 44:06.853
-Amen!
-That justice rules in the world!

44:06.936 --> 44:08.104
Amen!

44:08.187 --> 44:11.732
That the best is reserved
only for the best!

44:11.816 --> 44:13.192
Amen!

44:13.985 --> 44:18.156
<i>And that our duty is to raise</i>
<i>and send them to the Process!</i>

44:18.239 --> 44:19.657
<i>Amen!</i>

44:19.740 --> 44:23.828
<i>-We must accept their superiority!</i>
<i>-Amen!</i>

44:24.495 --> 44:27.957
<i>Because only the Process</i>
<i>can save our world!</i>

44:28.040 --> 44:29.041
<i>Amen!</i>

44:30.168 --> 44:34.922
<i>And those who stand against it</i>
<i>will perish in the cruelest of hells!</i>

44:35.006 --> 44:35.882
<i>Amen!</i>

44:35.965 --> 44:36.966
FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE

44:37.049 --> 44:38.509
[Fernando's father]
<i>Amen.</i>

44:52.899 --> 44:55.860
You think you can change everyone's mind!

44:56.652 --> 44:58.279
But you can't.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.937
[Ezequiel] <i>Only three percent of you</i>

45:31.020 --> 45:34.398
<i>will be part of a select group of heroes</i>
<i>heading to the Offshore.</i>

45:35.942 --> 45:39.570
<i>Only the deserving three percent.</i>

45:42.114 --> 45:46.577
Remember, you create your own merit.

45:49.664 --> 45:51.499
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

45:53.000 --> 45:54.502
you deserve this.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.879
[sobbing]

46:40.089 --> 46:43.301
[upbeat instrumental music playing]

47:47.198 --> 47:49.200
