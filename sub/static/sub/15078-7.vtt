I APPRECIATE YOUR INITIATIVE,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.885
BUT JUDGE TRENT
WAS BRUTALLY STABBED TO DEATH

09:44.918 --> 09:46.119
IN HER OWN HOME.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.121
IT HARDLY LOOKS LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL HIT.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.590
WHAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE
IS THE WORK OF A DISTURBED MAN

09:50.624 --> 09:52.559
WHOM DR. PIERCE
CLAIMED WAS NOT A THREAT.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.328
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT BRADY'S NOT THE KILLER.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.897
YOUR PET EXPERT
SCREWED THE POOCH.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.999
BECAUSE OF HIM,
JUDGE TRENT IS DEAD!

09:59.032 --> 10:00.367
BECAUSE OF THAT,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.502
I JUST GOT AN EARFUL
FROM THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.905
AFTER HE GOT AN EARFUL
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.340
NOT EXACTLY
THE IMPRESSION I WANTED TO MAKE

10:07.374 --> 10:09.142
IN MY FIRST WEEK
IN THIS JOB.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.579
NOT EXACTLY THE IMPRESSION
I WANTED TO MAKE ON YOU, EITHER.

10:13.647 --> 10:17.284
[ CHUCKLES ]

10:17.317 --> 10:18.852
THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

10:18.886 --> 10:20.721
WHY I'M GOING TO MUDDLE THROUGH
THIS INVESTIGATION

10:20.754 --> 10:22.923
WITHOUT
YOUR INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.393
YES, MA'AM.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.529
CRAZY CRIME --
MUST BE A CRAZY KILLER.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.165
NO WAY A SANE PERSON
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

10:32.199 --> 10:34.167
SO IT'S GOT TO BE
A SCHIZOPHRENIC.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.602
YOU'RE OVER-IDENTIFYING
WITH BRADY.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.170
YEAH, THAT'S
'CAUSE HE'S WRONGLY ACCUSED.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.906
DANIEL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN VIOLENT

10:38.939 --> 10:40.908
DOESN'T MEAN THE SAME IS TRUE
OF ALL SCHIZOPHRENICS.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.745
WELL, ALL OF BRADY'S DELUSIONS
ABOUT THE JUDGE WERE POSITIVE.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.047
HE VENERATED THE WOMAN.
HE HAD NO REASON TO HURT HER.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.682
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT HE DID.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.650
WELL, IF YOU'RE SO SURE
THAT HE'S INNOCENT,

10:50.684 --> 10:52.452
WOULDN'T FINDING HIM
AND EXONERATING HIM

10:52.485 --> 10:54.822
BE BETTER THAN RANTING TO ME
ABOUT THE INJUSTICE OF IT ALL?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.289
YES.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.591
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT I'M PERSONA NON GRATA

10:58.625 --> 11:00.060
AT THE FBI
AT THE MOMENT.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.628
BESIDES,
HOW WOULD I FIND HIM

11:01.661 --> 11:04.965
WHEN 100 FEDERAL AGENTS
AND THE CHICAGO P.D. CAN'T?

11:04.998 --> 11:10.637
BECAUSE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HIM
IN A WAY THAT NO COP CAN.

11:10.670 --> 11:16.143
WHERE DO YOU FIND ANSWERS
TO PROBLEMS YOU CAN'T SOLVE?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.145
You are not
supposed to be here.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.479
I think I know
how to find Brady.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.148
DANIEL, WE WERE
KICKED OFF THE CASE.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.950
THE KEY IS UNDERSTANDING
HIS DELUSIONS.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.617
REMEMBER "THE HEALER"?

11:24.651 --> 11:26.353
HE TRUSTED HER.
HE CONFIDED IN HER.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.222
IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS,
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP US FIND HIM.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.424
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE IS FROM THE PLANET ELLEBRA.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.927
SO, WAIT? YOU WANT ME
TO TRACK DOWN AN ALIEN?

11:33.961 --> 11:37.164
NO, IN BRADY'S MIND, JUDGE TRENT
WAS AN ALIEN, BUT SHE'S REAL.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.531
THE HEALER MUST BE, TOO.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.433
SO, WHERE SHOULD START?
THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.469
THE JUDGE ORDERED HIM
INTO PSYCHIATRIC CARE.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.371
"THE HEALER"
MAY BE ONE OF HIS DOCTORS.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.373
AGENTS TALKED TO BRADY'S
SHRINK AT CEDAR HEIGHTS.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.041
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.011
OKAY, SO, THERE'S LOTS
OF CAREGIVERS IN A HOSPITAL --

11:51.044 --> 11:53.046
ORDERLIES, NURSES,
SOCIAL WORKERS.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.714
WE CAN'T
JUST MARCH INTO THE HOSPITAL

11:54.748 --> 11:57.017
AND START INTERVIEWING
500 EMPLOYEES.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.651
WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM,

11:58.685 --> 12:00.187
AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH THE REAL KATE MORETTI?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.758
Ellen: WHAT DOES THE FBI WANT
WITH BRADY?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.159
WELL, WE'RE TRYING TO
LOCATE HIM.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.460
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.029
THEY THINK HE STABBED
A FEDERAL JUDGE.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.530
OH, THERE'S NO WAY.
BRADY'S GENTLE.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.265
AND HE'S FREAKED OUT
BY THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.967
YOU CAN'T EVEN
GET NEAR HIM WITH A SYRINGE

12:14.001 --> 12:15.268
UNLESS HE HAS
A VALIUM IN HIM.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.637
HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN LIKE THAT.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.672
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU KNOW HIM PRETTY WELL.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.975
HE'S KIND OF
A FREQUENT FLYER AROUND HERE.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.877
HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT
OF TREATMENT A DOZEN TIMES

12:23.911 --> 12:25.178
SINCE HE WAS 17.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.980
HE'S A SWEET KID
WHEN HE'S ON HIS MEDS.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.482
WELL, APPARENTLY,
HE'S NOT ON THEM NOW.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.218
I KNOW.
I SPOKE WITH HIM LAST WEEK.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.752
YOU KEPT IN TOUCH
AFTER HE WAS DISCHARGED.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.654
HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANYONE ELSE.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.289
BOTH HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD,

12:36.323 --> 12:38.892
AND HE SCARES NEW PEOPLE OFF
WITH HIS DELUSIONS ABOUT ALIENS.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.660
HE'S LUCKY
TO HAVE A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.595
SOME FRIEND I WAS.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.164
I KNEW HE WAS DECOMPENSATING,
AND I COULDN'T CONVINCE HIM

12:44.197 --> 12:46.666
TO GET BACK ON HIS MEDS
OR ADMIT HIMSELF.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.936
I WISH
I COULD HAVE HELPED.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.270
YOU CAN HELP HIM NOW.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.771
[ SIGHS ]

12:51.805 --> 12:55.075
YOU MEAN I CAN HELP YOU.
YOU WANT ME TO TURN HIM IN.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.409
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.911
IF I DID,
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T TELL YOU.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.513
I'VE SEEN HOW COPS
TREAT THE MENTALLY ILL.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
ONE TIME BRADY
WAS BROUGHT IN BY CPD,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.251
THEY PEPPER-SPRAYED HIM
FOR NO REASON.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.819
ELLEN, I'M NOT A COP.
I'M A PHYSICIAN.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.255
I KNOW HOW TO
BRING BRADY IN SAFELY.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.023
AND ONCE WE DO THAT,
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE

13:10.057 --> 13:11.825
TO GET HIM MANDATED
BACK INTO TREATMENT.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.094
NO JAIL?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.162
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.935
THERE'S AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE
OFF TORRENCE AVENUE.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.204
I PICKED HIM UP THERE ONCE
WHEN HE CALLED ME FOR HELP.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.606
HE SAID
IT'S A PORTAL TO ELLEBRA.

13:29.843 --> 13:33.613
WHEN WE GET THERE, YOU HAVE TO
LET ME TAKE THE LEAD.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.148
DANIEL, WE CAN'T
GO PICK HIM UP ON OUR OWN.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.149
WHY NOT?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.717
BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING

13:37.750 --> 13:39.052
FOR ME TO INTERVIEW
A BUNCH OF HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.153
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A FUGITIVE HERE,

13:40.187 --> 13:41.488
MAYBE ARMED,
MAYBE DANGEROUS.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.556
HE'S NOT DANGEROUS.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.125
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT,

13:45.158 --> 13:46.726

AND I HAVEN'T FOLLOW PROCEDURE,

HI KNOW, I KNOW.--

13:48.328 --> 13:50.463

TROUBLE WITH YOUR NEW BOSS.

HE WON'T TALK TO THEM.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.398

HE'S TALKING A GREAT DEAL.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.467

HE'S MADE A FULL CONFESSION.

LOCATING BRADY.

IS FINISHED.

ACTUALLY DID IT.

MATCH BRADY McGRAW'S.

YOU CAN'T BE SURE.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.724

WHERE THE KNIFE WAS HIDDEN.

I STABBED HER, OVER AND OVER,

16:34.961 --> 16:38.398
AND I DIDN'T STOP
UNTIL SHE WAS DEAD.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.400
OF COURSE HE CONFESSED.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.968
IT'S CALLED
IMAGINATION INFLATION.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.104
YOU TELL A SCHIZOPHRENIC
THE SAME STORY ENOUGH TIMES

16:44.137 --> 16:45.472
AND HE STARTS
TO BELIEVE IT.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.040
THOSE AGENTS
TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN

16:47.074 --> 16:48.441
THAT THEY KNOW
HE DID IT.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.443
DANIEL, IT WAS
A BY-THE-BOOK INTERROGATION,

16:50.477 --> 16:52.445
BRADY WAS OFFERED FOOD,
WATER.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.447
HE WAS NEVER YELLED AT
OR THREATENED.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.116
HE SHOULD HAVE
HAD AN ATTORNEY PRESENT.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.418
THEY MIRANDIZED HIM TWICE.
HE DENIED REPRESENTATION.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.153
WELL, OF COURSE,
BECAUSE HE SAID,

17:00.187 --> 17:02.122
"THE ONLY LAW
IS THE LAW OF ELLEBRA."

AT ARRAIGNMENT.

WAS ON HIS CLOTHES.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.832
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.033
JUST NEED TO BE CREATIVE.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.034
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:23.068 --> 38:24.836
ALL JUDGES MAKE ENEMIES.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.938
I'M SURE YOUR WIFE
HAS MORE THAN JUST A FEW.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.340
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

38:28.374 --> 38:30.609
I'M SAYING
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.145
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER SHE
GOES ALONE OR YOU GO WITH HER.

38:39.585 --> 38:43.622
SO YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT BRADY McGRAW.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.058
YOU KNEW HIS DELUSIONS WOULD
MAKE HIM THE PERFECT FALL GUY.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.961
I WANTED YOU
TO ARREST BRADY.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.963
THAT WAY, LONERGAN'S PLAN
WOULDN'T WORK,

38:51.997 --> 38:57.135
AND I'D HAVE HAD MORE TIME
TO CHANGE KAREN'S MIND.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.303
Kate: AND THEN
WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,

38:58.336 --> 39:00.472
YOU REALIZED
YOU NEEDED AN ALIBI,

39:00.506 --> 39:01.940
AND LONERGAN
GOT HIS STOOGE

39:01.973 --> 39:03.575
TO LURE BRADY TO THE HOUSE
WITH THE CALLS.

39:03.609 --> 39:06.378
IT WAS A GREAT PLAN.

39:06.412 --> 39:09.014
AND IT WORKED OUT EVEN BETTER
THAN YOU COULD HAVE IMAGINED

39:09.047 --> 39:11.417
WHEN THE POOR GUY ACTUALLY
CONFESSED TO THE MURDER.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.387
IT WAS ALMOST
THE PERFECT CRIME.

39:20.225 --> 39:22.193
Daniel:
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

39:22.227 --> 39:23.595
I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.096
TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.365
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN MAKE IT.

39:27.399 --> 39:28.900
YOU WILL.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.903
THANKS.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.805
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.242
ACTUALLY, I DO.

39:38.810 --> 39:42.247
I WAS DIAGNOSED
WHEN I WAS 22.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.817
SO YOU'RE ON MEDS, TOO?

39:48.186 --> 39:51.156
THERE'S NO
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL TREATMENT.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.325
BUT WORK HELPS.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.529
AND, UH, FRIENDS.

40:00.265 --> 40:04.870
THE PERSON I CARED ABOUT MOST
WASN'T EVEN REAL.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.072
BUT I STILL MISS HER.

40:15.113 --> 40:18.083
Max: HEY, DOC.
DEAN HALEY CALLED.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.652
WANTED TO KNOW HOW
THE STOMACH FLU'S TREATING YOU.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.754
TELL HIM
I'VE MADE A FULL RECOVERY.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.389
I ALREADY DID.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.459
YOU'VE GOT BACK-TO-BACK MAKE-UP
CLASSES STARTING AT 10:00

40:27.493 --> 40:29.461
AND A FACULTY MEETING
OVER LUNCH.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.597
OH, AND I PICKED UP
YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.064
IT'S RIGHT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.835
GOOD FOR YOU, DOC.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.704
GOOD NIGHT, MAX.

WHEN SHE'S GONE ♪
