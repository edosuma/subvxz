WEBVTT

00:16.117 --> 00:17.751
( knocking on door )

00:25.626 --> 00:28.262
Hi, hi.
Welcome to California.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.164
- Friendly state.
- Yeah.

00:32.533 --> 00:36.770
Hey...
we're married.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.372
Hmm.
All right.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.241
No, no, no, no.
No, wait.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.509
I want to do this
right, okay?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.511
- So--
- Oh, no!

00:43.544 --> 00:46.247
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Yes, yes!

00:46.280 --> 00:47.848
- Okay.
- Don't. Put me down.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.384
Okay. I'm trying
to be romantic, okay?

00:50.418 --> 00:52.520
Just-- just
for the record,

00:52.553 --> 00:54.388
this is my house,
you're unemployed,

00:54.422 --> 00:56.390
and this is an absurd,
sexist tradition.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.126
- Ouch.
- What?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.660
I was just kidding
about that employed thing.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.861
I know, I know.
I think I--

01:00.894 --> 01:02.163
I think I pulled
something.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.199
( sighs )

01:05.233 --> 01:09.203
Can we cross
the threshold together
like not crazy people?

01:09.237 --> 01:10.504
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.343
- That was easier.
- Mmm.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.478
Good call...

01:17.511 --> 01:19.880
Mrs. Rendon.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.250
You're welcome,
Mr. Howe.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.819
( keys clicking )

01:31.459 --> 01:33.327
( key beeps )

01:37.165 --> 01:38.699
( phone rings )

01:41.202 --> 01:43.237
- Man: It's me.
- Hey, Joe, I got
the login set up.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.638
It just leads
to a blank directory,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.208
but our network
is officially live.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.777
- Ryan, I'm out.
- Wait, out? Out of what?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.179
MacMillan Utility.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.515
which means NSFNET
is paused.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.185
How-- how-- how is that
even possible? It's--

01:57.218 --> 01:59.220
I'll explain later.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.889
What I need is for you
to go in tomorrow
like nothing happened

02:01.922 --> 02:04.225
because you're
gonna be fired.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.494
The less you know,
the better,

02:06.527 --> 02:09.897
and if anyone asks,
we never talked.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.338
Ah, Mr. Ray. Let's chat.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.775
Hey, Bruce.
It's Gordon.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.245
What is this?
Bootleg "Top Gun"?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.380
Better. Just watch.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.316
I want to hear you
watch it.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.586
( whirrs )

02:35.823 --> 02:37.791
...founding CEO
of MacMillan...

02:37.825 --> 02:39.660
Oh, jeez.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.396
These things
are bad enough
when I'm there.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.831
What am I watchin'
this for?

02:43.864 --> 02:44.965
Bruce:
I don't wanna spoil it.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.669
- Watch.
- No. Never.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.670
- Man: What?
- Man #2: Turn it off.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.306
Don't.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.674
I, Joe MacMillan,
stole the code

02:53.707 --> 02:56.544
to the security software
from Gordon Clark.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.879
Everything this company
is built on is his.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.282
Holy shit.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.883
Bruce:
That's what
I wanted to hear.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.585
I talked
to the partners,

03:04.618 --> 03:08.489
and we think
this is worth
at least 25 mil.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.224
You hear me?
Gordon?

03:10.258 --> 03:11.625
Y-yeah. Yeah.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.761
( footsteps approaching )

03:13.794 --> 03:16.497
Donna:
Gordon, we're gonna
be late.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.371
Is everything okay?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.773
Yeah, everything's
great.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.514
( "People Going Nowhere"
playing )

03:42.290 --> 03:45.259
* Above the highway
and below the sky *

03:48.562 --> 03:51.999
* A young child
sees cars go by *

03:55.035 --> 03:58.739
* On any bridge
he can be found *

04:01.775 --> 04:04.345
* On any street
in any town *

04:04.378 --> 04:06.414
( phone ringing )

04:08.516 --> 04:11.352
* He don't complain
and he doesn't shift... *

04:11.385 --> 04:12.920
- ( music fades )
- ( ringing continues )

04:24.932 --> 04:26.634
Donna:
I was thinking
of adding

04:26.667 --> 04:29.036
a wedding ring
customization.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.639
Heard your avatar
could maybe use one.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.507
Hmm.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.909
Well, that took Gordon
longer than I thought.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.280
Is it okay for me
to say I'm happy for you?

04:42.550 --> 04:43.951
You can say that.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
This is silly.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.891
We should celebrate.
When does Tom get here?

04:50.924 --> 04:54.528
Uh, um...

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
he got here
this morning.

04:56.464 --> 05:00.434
Well, then...
what are you doin'
tonight?

05:04.438 --> 05:08.041
( theme music playing )

05:35.769 --> 05:36.203
( door closes )

05:43.411 --> 05:44.412
So, how bad is it?

05:50.418 --> 05:51.919
"Mr. MacMillan
knew from the start

05:51.952 --> 05:55.055
the Citadel software
would never remain free.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.924
He wanted to reap
the PR benefits

05:56.957 --> 06:00.394
and worry
about the fallout
from the lie later."

06:00.428 --> 06:01.795
- Jesus.
- It's the first shot

06:01.829 --> 06:04.598
in what's gonna be
a very ugly war.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.401
I just have to
return volley.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.870
What happened with Ken
when you went in?

06:09.903 --> 06:12.072
I want
the blow-by-blow.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.874
- I did what you
told me...
- Mm-hmm.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.576
which was
to say nothing,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.978
which was easy
because I know nothing.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.681
Good. Now that you're
out of there, we can--

06:20.714 --> 06:22.583
But Ken
didn't fire me.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.552
What? Why not?

06:24.585 --> 06:25.919
What did he offer you?

06:25.953 --> 06:27.187
He didn't
offer me anything.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.990
Not yet.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.859
It's probably best
if we don't talk

06:31.892 --> 06:33.561
or see each other
until this is over.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.967
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.835
Look, Ryan,
you're the weak link
in all this.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.772
He knows the only way
to get to me
is through you.

06:50.043 --> 06:54.482
Tom:
So, I'm 10 minutes away
from going bowling--

06:54.515 --> 06:56.817
and I don't
even like bowling--

06:56.850 --> 07:00.120
but, anyway,
there's a knock
at the door.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.989
And I-- I open it.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.824
I'm thinking it's
that weird neighbor

07:03.857 --> 07:05.859
asking if his Burmese python
is loose in my yard again.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.129
But, no, it's Cameron,

07:09.162 --> 07:14.234
and she has this
look on her face.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.504
I'll never forget it.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.507
What happened next?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.544
( laughs )

07:23.577 --> 07:26.880
Okay, so you had
the honeymoon
before the wedding.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.616
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha!

07:28.649 --> 07:30.751
( coughs )

07:30.784 --> 07:32.720
And, uh,
how did you propose?

07:32.753 --> 07:36.490
- Technically, I didn't.
- Yeah, I proposed to him.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.758
- Mmm, no.
- Donna: Mm-hmm?

07:37.791 --> 07:38.792
Technically,
you didn't either.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.595
- Yes, I did.
- No.

07:41.629 --> 07:45.032
Yeah, at some point,
Cam said...

07:47.067 --> 07:48.536
"I wish it could be
like this forever."

07:48.569 --> 07:52.906
And I said,
"Uh, it could be."

07:52.940 --> 07:56.644
And she said,
"But you won't move
to California."

07:56.677 --> 07:59.112
And, um, yeah.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.916
And then he said,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.985
"I won't move
to California
for a girlfriend,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.254
but I would move
there for my wife."

08:07.287 --> 08:09.590
And the next day we found
a Justice of the Peace.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.693
Oh, my God.
Gordon, isn't that
romantic?

08:14.227 --> 08:15.228
What?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.631
Tom and Cameron's story.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.269
Right.
Um, congratulations.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.906
- Okay.
- Thanks. Cheers.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.616
So, um,
you gonna come
work at Mutiny?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.150
Uh, actually, no.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.219
We decided
that's what killed things
last time, so--

08:39.252 --> 08:41.789
you know, mixing
a relationship with work.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.293
Really?

08:46.326 --> 08:49.963
And by that,
I mean that lots
of couples do that,

08:49.997 --> 08:52.566
and it's great.
It's just-- it's just
really not for us.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.568
But I'm gonna
swing by on Wednesday

08:54.602 --> 08:57.104
to say hi to the guys.
I cannot wait to see

08:57.137 --> 08:58.706
the looks on their faces
when they hear.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.040
- They're gonna be shocked.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.009
You know, Bos has really
kept this under his hat.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.177
Hmm.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.289
Ahem.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.560
( faint barking )

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
Bos.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.973
Look, I know full well
I should've come in
last night.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.244
I'm listening.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.347
Have you heard
of the Midas Touch?

09:40.380 --> 09:44.051
Well, I got the...
opposite of that.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.988
I'm on the outs
with my ex-wife
and my son--

09:48.021 --> 09:50.357
hell, practically
everybody I did business
with back in Texas.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.359
And to top it all off,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.628
I did 14 months
in a federal prison.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.834
I thought
you should know that...

10:00.868 --> 10:03.170
before I cross
this threshold.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.042
La Tuna, right?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.945
Outside El Paso,
medium security?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.981
You really think
I'd go into business
with a company

10:14.014 --> 10:16.383
and not do background checks
on all of its key players?

10:28.428 --> 10:31.732
So, you think of me
as a "key player"?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.867
( chuckles )

10:33.901 --> 10:35.268
Just give me
the damn flowers

10:35.302 --> 10:39.139
and stop making problems
where there aren't any.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.074
( water splashes,
stops )

10:57.057 --> 10:59.026
Look, I just--
I wanted to--

10:59.059 --> 11:01.461
Donna, look,

11:01.494 --> 11:04.397
we weren't keeping it
just from you, okay?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.133
Tom's mom
only found out
last Friday.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.135
Oh. No, I get it.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.737
It must have been fun

11:09.770 --> 11:13.306
having a secret
nobody knew about.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.743
Yeah, a little.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.044
Would have been nice
to get a heads up

11:17.077 --> 11:18.746
you were moving out,
though.

11:18.779 --> 11:23.416
- The girls really miss you.
- Yeah, I regret that.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.759
Look, it's just,
I...

11:31.792 --> 11:34.161
haven't had
the easiest time
trusting you lately.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
No, I know.

11:38.465 --> 11:42.302
I think
that's probably

11:42.335 --> 11:44.805
because I lied
to you.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.008
I hate it.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.045
It's been uncomfortable
and awful,

11:52.079 --> 11:54.147
and I just--
I hate it.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.052
Yeah.
( exhales )

11:59.086 --> 12:01.421
I wanna trust you
again.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.857
I do. I-- I-- I want
things to go back

12:03.891 --> 12:06.426
the way
they used to be
between us.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.898
I miss it.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.901
I miss it, too.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.471
So, where does that
leave us?

12:18.505 --> 12:21.809
Can we just
start over?

12:26.179 --> 12:28.448
( sighs )

12:28.481 --> 12:29.817
Yeah.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.422
Yeah, let's just...
have a fresh start.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
- A fresh start.
- Yeah.

12:39.893 --> 12:44.297
So, in the spirit
of complete honesty,

12:44.331 --> 12:45.799
I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

12:45.833 --> 12:49.536
and I really think
we should go public.

12:53.206 --> 12:58.378
Okay. Well, I'm not
completely opposed to it.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.980
- You're not?
- No.

13:00.013 --> 13:04.017
I mean, we're in
the land of the IPO.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.419
If I wasn't open to it,
I would've just stayed
in Texas.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.988
Imagine having
the resources

13:08.021 --> 13:10.357
to take the company
wherever we wanna go.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.361
Yeah, I have
a pretty big
imagination.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.830
I'm counting on it.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.302
Donna, you're here.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.371
So, after last night,

13:24.404 --> 13:25.605
I haven't been able
to stop thinking

13:25.638 --> 13:27.274
about all the things
we can do

13:27.307 --> 13:28.942
to upgrade Mutiny
before the IPO.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.377
I wrote down
some ideas,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.379
and I think we should
get started right away.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.317
- Oh, wow.
There's a lot here.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.053
It's like once I started,
the floodgates opened.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.190
Well, you've obviously
put a lot of thought
and effort into this.

13:43.223 --> 13:47.594
I did, yeah.
It totally reconfigures
Mutiny and SwapMeet

13:47.627 --> 13:49.562
while returning them
to their roots,

13:49.596 --> 13:52.599
excising everything that's bad
and keeping what's good.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.468
Oh, and, yeah,
it takes us beyond
the Commodore

13:55.502 --> 13:57.337
onto other platforms
which we have to do.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.339
That became obvious
around 5:00 a.m.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.942
Other platforms, right.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.276
How long do you
see that taking?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.513
A year.
Maybe two.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.848
But the goal is
to do it right.
Right?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.353
I'm sure everything that
you've outlined here is great.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.088
I am.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.190
But we can't afford
to wait two years.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.491
Sure we can.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.261
The timeframe for the IPO
is three months.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.563
Three months?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.298
No one ever
said anything
about three months.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.134
Why is that suddenly
the magic number?

14:27.167 --> 14:29.569
Because we have
an acquisition offer
in hand.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.404
People are paying
attention to us right now.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.640
But what we have
right now is broken.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.544
What we have right now,
CompuServe thinks is worth
$20 million.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.914
Yes, but if we make
the improvements
the way I know we can,

14:40.948 --> 14:43.183
we'll be worth
$100 million.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.584
I thought we were
in agreement on this.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.319
We still can be.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.589
Okay, look,
I really hate
to play this card,

14:49.622 --> 14:52.525
but as head
of the company,
I'm saying

14:52.559 --> 14:54.627
that we'll need
to put the brakes
on any IPO

14:54.661 --> 14:57.064
until we get
our house in order.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.368
Okay, how about this?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.236
I will read this
more closely

15:03.270 --> 15:05.405
to get a better
understanding of what
you have in mind--

15:05.438 --> 15:07.307
Great. Okay.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.042
And if there's anything
you don't understand,
just ask me.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.611
Um, I promise,
this is the way to go.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.519
( sighs )

15:19.552 --> 15:21.321
I just got off
the phone with "Forbes"

15:21.354 --> 15:22.990
and it doesn't sound
like a generous piece.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.324
They're asking me
questions about WestGroup,

15:24.357 --> 15:27.427
questions about Cardiff,
questions about IBM.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.962
( knocking on door )

15:28.996 --> 15:31.198
Listen,
they've clearly
got an angle

15:31.231 --> 15:34.467
and it is not one
that is favorable to me.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.204
- I'm calling you back.
- ( phone beeps )

15:37.237 --> 15:38.471
I guess you talked
to your lawyers.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.112
Wow. This is...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.216
not what I expected.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.119
I sure do love
that couch.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.222
I take it
you used a designer?

15:55.255 --> 15:58.758
And, hey, me and Donna
have this same vase.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
- Pier 1, right?
- It's not a vase.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.197
I commissioned that
from Kayako Sakaniwa,
a Tokyo artist.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.767
- Hmm.
- She calls it
"Serenity."

16:07.800 --> 16:11.038
Gordon,
I imagine you have
some questions...

16:11.071 --> 16:13.573
- beyond the decor.
- Not really.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.076
You obviously wanted
to get fired.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.744
I've seen
that move before.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.647
It's, uh-- it's
more complicated
than that.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.083
Yeah?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.618
Shocker.

16:25.652 --> 16:30.490
Man, this is one
kick-ass view.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.625
You can see
the bridge from here.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.728
I'll bet you
get back every dollar
you put into this place.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.698
Hell, I might even
buy it from you--

16:40.100 --> 16:43.603
the furniture,
the Serenity vase--

16:43.636 --> 16:44.737
the whole
kit and caboodle.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.306
I never wanted you
not to profit.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.376
"I, Joe MacMillan,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.511
stole the code
to our security software

16:51.544 --> 16:53.680
from Gordon Clark
of Clark Computers.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.816
Everything
I've earned is his."

16:56.849 --> 17:00.120
It's the most truthful thing
you've ever said.

17:00.153 --> 17:04.491
Honestly, I was moved.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.493
I never figured you
for a sore winner.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.628
Me, either,
but it's nice to know

17:08.661 --> 17:10.297
we can still
surprise ourselves.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.365
So, what do you say
we cut through the bullshit

17:12.399 --> 17:14.101
and you just tell me
what your angle is
in all this?

17:19.806 --> 17:23.110
The truth is--

17:23.143 --> 17:25.812
and this is
the truth--

17:25.845 --> 17:28.648
I have come
across something
that I am convinced is--

17:28.681 --> 17:32.252
well, it's something
that I really believe in,

17:32.285 --> 17:33.653
and we'll leave it
at that.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.788
But I couldn't convince
my board of its value,

17:35.822 --> 17:38.391
so I ignored them,
I moved forward,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.693
and just like that,
I lost my company.

17:40.727 --> 17:45.398
I was out of moves,
and then it occurred to me,

17:45.432 --> 17:47.167
what if it wasn't
my company?

17:48.701 --> 17:53.273
So, you screw over
your evil corporate overlord

17:53.306 --> 17:55.675
by parachuting
your stake out to me.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.680
Okay, I get that...
sort of.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.649
How do you come out on top
in this scenario?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.617
I don't.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.353
Everything I had
is yours.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.355
If you feel like
I deserve a percentage,

18:08.388 --> 18:10.290
well, that is
entirely up to you.

18:10.323 --> 18:14.861
So, your plan was for me
to just give you the money?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.596
After you stole
everything from me?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.131
You wrote the code,
agreed,

18:18.165 --> 18:21.601
but I offered you
partnership twice,

18:21.634 --> 18:24.471
and you turned me down
twice.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.739
I have to think
that you're not so myopic

18:26.773 --> 18:29.409
that you can't see
that I might be entitled
to a little return

18:29.442 --> 18:32.245
for turning it into
what I've turned it into.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.214
This is
an interesting piece.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.452
And whose work
is this?

18:41.788 --> 18:42.822
Joe:
Mine.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.760
Gordon, to be clear,
you don't have to
give me anything.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.896
Thanks for making
that clear.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.298
But I built
an entire company

18:51.331 --> 18:52.699
and I've just
handed you everything.

18:52.732 --> 18:56.769
All I am asking for
is basically a finder's fee.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.310
Joe, I really do
like this piece.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.744
What do you call it?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.849
It's an abstract.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.451
Yeah?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.454
'Cause it seems to me

19:14.487 --> 19:16.323
like one of
those paintings

19:16.356 --> 19:19.459
that the more
you look at it,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.728
the more it seems
to come into focus.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.731
Gordon, I know
this is a leap of
faith on my part,

19:24.764 --> 19:28.601
but faith is somethin'
I'm workin' on.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.737
Faith is a--

19:30.770 --> 19:34.874
faith is
a valuable thing.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.909
I'd just look
for somewhere else
to place it.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.747
Thanks for
the company, Joe.

19:43.416 --> 19:47.220
- ( doorbell rings )
- Donna.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.222
Is everything okay?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.490
Cameron's gone off
the deep end

19:50.523 --> 19:52.225
and I don't know
what to do.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.761
She came in
today with this
Mutiny manifesto

19:54.794 --> 19:56.629
that will kill
the IPO.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.265
And she's
committed to it.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.434
She did everything
but nail it to my forehead.

20:01.468 --> 20:05.238
Maybe I should
take the night
to read this over.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.907
Why wait?
Why not read it now?
I can wait.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.509
Because I think
she's tryin' to stop you

20:09.542 --> 20:12.379
from figurin' out
I'm here.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.781
Oh! Bos!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.849
I-- hi.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.552
- Oh, hi.
- ( chuckles )

20:19.586 --> 20:22.755
It's a relatively
recent development.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.261
But if you're
worried about
Cameron finding out,

20:28.295 --> 20:29.662
I haven't
talked to her
in over a month.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.298
So, say what
you came to say.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.833
- This is a lot.
- Yeah.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.503
- How long to implement?
- A year. Maybe two.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.472
That's a long time
to wait.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.408
Why is she
against the IPO?

20:41.441 --> 20:44.344
She's not, and
that's what makes it
so frustrating,

20:44.377 --> 20:46.613
but it's what happens
with Cameron--

20:46.646 --> 20:48.348
and, Bos,
you can back me up--

20:48.381 --> 20:49.749
she gets
in her own way.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.351
It's a little more
complicated than that,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.886
but I suppose
that's part of it.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.388
So, what do you
want to do?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.524
I don't know.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.360
Cameron acts like
she's majority shareholder,
but she's not.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.028
She's got more votes
than anyone,

21:02.061 --> 21:04.364
but not more votes
than everyone.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.766
I'd prefer you
to find common ground.
Are you sure you can't?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.835
Just this morning
you were telling me

21:08.868 --> 21:11.438
what a wonderful time
you had celebrating
her marriage,

21:11.471 --> 21:13.440
how you were excited
to start a new chapter.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.543
Right, and then
she comes in and
dumps this on me.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.312
Back up a beat.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.447
Cameron got married?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.851
Oh, Bos,
I assumed you knew.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.854
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.056
Wasn't your news
to tell.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.080
Love what you've done
with the place.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.483
Drinks with Diane?

21:56.516 --> 21:59.586
Diane, no drinks.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.689
( sighs )

22:02.722 --> 22:07.360
It's Cameron.
She changed her mind
about the IPO.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.496
What?
She wants to kill it?

22:09.529 --> 22:11.030
That is not
her intent,

22:11.063 --> 22:14.501
but if she has her way,
it will be the result.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.769
Well, sorry
to hear that.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.038
Nothing's settled yet,
but moving forward

22:19.071 --> 22:22.775
means getting
all the equity owners
to overrule her.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.778
We've got 35%,
and then there's
Diane and Bos

22:25.812 --> 22:27.447
and Doug and Craig.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.517
And Cameron has no idea
this is happening?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.785
Nothing is happening.
It's all talk at the moment,

22:32.819 --> 22:36.789
but I have to explore
every option.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.725
We don't own 35%
of the company.

22:38.758 --> 22:42.395
- Yeah, sure we do.
- No, you own 25%

22:42.429 --> 22:45.164
and Clark Computers owns 10%
for buying the mainframe.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.734
And Clark Computers,
i.e., me,

22:47.767 --> 22:50.403
doesn't like the idea
of blindsiding Cameron

22:50.437 --> 22:52.138
and shoving this IPO
down her throat.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.407
( stammers )
That's-- that is--

22:54.441 --> 22:59.546
just a gross
mischaracterization. I--

22:59.579 --> 23:02.415
Donna, if you
pull this move,

23:02.449 --> 23:05.885
I guarantee you
she'll see it
as an act of war.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.756
and you will cross a line
that you cannot uncross.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.090
So, don't kid yourself.

23:15.662 --> 23:20.733
It's been a long day.
I'm going to bed.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.974
Did you ever
witness Mr. MacMillan

23:28.007 --> 23:30.543
talking
to Gordon Clark?

23:30.577 --> 23:33.813
Nope.

23:33.846 --> 23:39.218
Did Mr. MacMillan ever
confide any plans he had
with Gordon Clark?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.020
No.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.989
( sniffs )

23:47.259 --> 23:51.831
Don't you find it odd,
the day we eighty-sixed
NSFNET

23:51.864 --> 23:53.666
and we shit-canned Joe

23:53.700 --> 23:57.537
he finds religion
and says Gordon invented

23:57.570 --> 23:59.071
the software
this company's built on,

23:59.105 --> 24:00.239
giving his
ex-partner,

24:00.272 --> 24:05.111
the one suing him,
everything?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.583
Or maybe
you didn't know.

24:10.617 --> 24:14.153
Maybe Joe didn't
tell you that part.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.023
And I always assumed
that you were involved.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.626
They didn't cut you
out of the deal, did they?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.160
Ah, no need to answer.

24:21.193 --> 24:24.497
Look, I'm sorry, kid.
It's bigger than you.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.633
You're just a pawn
that Joe sacrificed
in the end game,

24:26.666 --> 24:27.967
which means that
you're useless to us.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.902
You're probably
useless to him, too.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.271
So...

24:32.304 --> 24:34.907
that's it.

24:34.941 --> 24:35.942
It's time
for you to go.

24:35.975 --> 24:40.046
- So, I'm fired?
- Uh, yes.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.681
Good.

24:58.965 --> 25:02.068
Mr. Clark?
They're ready
for you.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.037
Gordon, what are you
doing here?

25:05.071 --> 25:09.909
Hey, Ryan.
You were right.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.645
That thing that you
and Joe were working on?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.013
It's gonna be huge.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.550
( door opens )

25:19.351 --> 25:20.987
( door closes )

25:21.020 --> 25:23.790
So, Mr. Clark, regardless
of what Mr. MacMillan

25:23.823 --> 25:25.658
thinks he got
away with,

25:25.692 --> 25:29.295
we plan to fully
challenge the veracity
of his confession.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.999
Hey, listen, I think
we can speed things up
without the lawyers.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.601
I mean,
I don't have mine.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.168
What do we say
you lose yours?

25:47.179 --> 25:49.015
You're not really
gonna try to convince me

25:49.048 --> 25:52.619
that you
and Joe didn't talk
about this, right?

25:52.652 --> 25:56.155
I'm not gonna
try and convince you
of anything.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.824
I'm here
to offer you a deal

25:57.857 --> 25:59.826
that will
make that question
irrelevant.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.294
Now, my lawyers say
I'm looking at a floor
of 25 million.

26:02.328 --> 26:05.598
- Your lawyers are dreaming.
- I'm willing to take
10% of that,

26:05.632 --> 26:07.033
along with the equipment
that Joe bought

26:07.066 --> 26:09.101
and the deals
that he made for NSFNET.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.304
Even if I wanted
to make that deal,

26:12.338 --> 26:14.774
I can't just hand you
a government contract.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.175
I mean, I could trade you
the infrastructure,

26:16.208 --> 26:17.644
but you would have to
chase that bid.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.779
No, I think
for 20 million,

26:19.812 --> 26:21.180
you can make a call
to the sector chief

26:21.213 --> 26:22.715
and make that happen.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.150
Or I could just sue you
and keep it all.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.619
Yeah, you could,
but you'll lose,

26:26.653 --> 26:28.821
and I think
you know that.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.057
We do it my way,
I'm giving you
everything that you want

26:31.090 --> 26:32.925
in exchange for
nothing you care about.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.328
Hmm. One thing
sticks in my craw.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.932
We make this deal,
you turn around and give
Joe everything he wants

26:39.966 --> 26:42.334
and that son of a bitch
wins again.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.936
And what
makes you think

26:43.970 --> 26:45.137
you're the only
one in this room

26:45.171 --> 26:47.073
that wants to stick it
to Joe MacMillan?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.945
Okay, let's
get this over with.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.814
Remember to detach
Arki from me

26:54.847 --> 26:56.683
when he uses this
as an excuse

26:56.716 --> 26:58.217
to hug me past
a socially acceptable
amount of time.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.352
I got it,
all right?

27:00.386 --> 27:03.289
Let's go fry
some coders' circuits,
Mrs. Howe-Rendon.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.759
- No.
- Rendon-Howe?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.828
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.432
Ahem.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.302
( "Sound Salvation"
playing )

27:16.335 --> 27:18.437
- Tom?
- Rendon!

27:18.470 --> 27:20.740
- Dude!
- What are you doin' here?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.742
- Man: Whoa!
- Hey, man!

27:22.775 --> 27:24.877
The prodigal son
returns.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.747
Tom the Bomb!

27:27.780 --> 27:29.215
Arki:
Finally, a real
coding lead.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.316
How long
you here for, Rendon?

27:30.349 --> 27:32.919
Uh, kind of
indefinitely.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.320
- No.
- Wait a minute. What?

27:34.353 --> 27:36.789
- Yeah, we got married!
- When did this happen?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.858
A couple weeks ago
in Texas.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.027
- You're not
pregnant, are you?
- Do I look pregnant?

27:41.060 --> 27:42.428
Bodie:
Why wasn't I invited?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.330
- Come here, you.
- Oh, God.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.865
Come on.

27:45.898 --> 27:50.770
- So happy for you.
- Okay, all right.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.805
- Thank you.
- You're a very lucky man.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.206
( men cheering )

27:54.240 --> 27:57.143
Here's to Mutiny's
first official marriage!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.245
May it a be long
and happy one.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.381
( applause )

28:04.817 --> 28:06.185
Cameron:
Okay, who wants some of that?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.787
Arki:
Oh, yeah.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.922
Man:
This looks great.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.458
Carl: Bodie,
would you stop drinking
out of the bottle, dude?

28:12.491 --> 28:14.794
Just stop drinking
out of the bottle.
Come on, man.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.863
- I bet I can finish it.
- You have to leave
room for cake.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.197
- No--
- Look it.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.799
- ( crowd groans )
- What, dude?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.934
( whistling )

28:21.968 --> 28:23.235
CQ! CQ!

28:23.269 --> 28:25.337
Hey.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.107
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.976
Have some cake.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.778
It's supermarket bought,
but that's the best kind.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.780
Chemical goodness.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.382
( chattering )

28:36.415 --> 28:39.351
Hey, uh...

28:39.385 --> 28:40.920
I need to talk
to you.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.324
- Okay.
- Not here.

28:45.357 --> 28:48.027
Yeah.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.864
( music fades )

29:01.107 --> 29:04.243
Donna wants to move
forward with the IPO...

29:04.276 --> 29:05.978
with or without you.

29:06.012 --> 29:09.381
Oh.
( sighs )

29:09.415 --> 29:13.519
Okay.
Tough titties.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.121
I don't want to,
and it's my company.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.523
You're the plurality
shareholder.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.291
You own the most.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.993
But if she gets
everyone else

29:21.027 --> 29:23.262
with a stake
in this company
to side with her,

29:23.295 --> 29:24.797
she can overrule you.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.870
Okay.

29:30.903 --> 29:34.874
Um, Doug and Craig
will obviously

29:34.907 --> 29:36.308
jump at the chance
to screw me.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.011
But even if she manages
to convince Diane,

29:39.045 --> 29:41.313
that's still
leaves you and Bos.
Game over.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.019
It leaves Bos.

29:50.189 --> 29:53.259
My vote's
gotta be with her...

29:53.292 --> 29:55.561
even if I'm against it.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.298
I'm sorry.

29:59.331 --> 30:03.302
She's out there
throwing me a party.

30:03.335 --> 30:07.039
and you're
gonna side with that
lying, two-faced, bi--

30:07.073 --> 30:11.443
Careful, okay?
That's my wife.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.545
Lucky you.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.185
Cam.

30:19.218 --> 30:23.189
( "Quiet Place" playing )

30:23.222 --> 30:27.326
- ( music continues )
- ( crowd chattering )

30:28.494 --> 30:31.597
* Follow me down to

30:31.630 --> 30:33.900
* A quiet place...

30:33.933 --> 30:37.069
( laughing )

30:37.103 --> 30:39.471
- Yeah, there's just--
- Cameron!

30:39.505 --> 30:42.341
Congratulations.
I'm so happy
for the two of you.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.144
Yeah, thanks.
Can I borrow you?

31:01.393 --> 31:04.964
( keypad beeping )

31:04.997 --> 31:09.035
( line ringing )

31:11.103 --> 31:13.339
Joe:
Hello?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.640
I have to ask you
something,

31:14.673 --> 31:16.175
and I need you to be
completely honest with me,

31:16.208 --> 31:19.078
because I don't know
what to believe anymore.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.379
So, don't lie
to me, okay?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.915
What do you want
to ask me?

31:22.949 --> 31:25.317
Did you plan
this whole thing
with Gordon?

31:25.351 --> 31:27.619
Are you moving forward
with NSFNET

31:27.653 --> 31:30.289
- and cutting me out?
- No, of course not.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.458
Where did you get
an idea like this?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.298
( sighs )

31:51.277 --> 31:55.214
- ( keys clicking )
- ( phone ringing )

31:57.616 --> 31:59.318
( ringing stops )

31:59.351 --> 32:01.920
( keys clicking )

32:04.056 --> 32:07.026
I need something
from you,

32:07.059 --> 32:08.694
and I know things
have been super awkward
between us

32:08.727 --> 32:12.164
since we got back
from Texas.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.033
I should
have said something,
but I didn't.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.501
I mean,
you didn't either,

32:15.534 --> 32:17.669
but that's not
the point right now.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.438
The point is,
I know it's not cool
to ask for something

32:19.471 --> 32:21.607
when there's this
other thing between us,

32:21.640 --> 32:24.476
but I really, really
need your help right now.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.114
When were you
gonna tell me?

32:28.147 --> 32:30.116
Bos, I just
found out myself.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.985
I didn't know
Donna was gonna try
an end run around me.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.556
About your marriage.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.626
- Oh.
- Look, Cam,

32:40.659 --> 32:42.761
I know you don't think
of me as a father.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.496
You made that clear.
That's okay.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.666
You're gonna feel
the way you wanna feel.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.603
But it won't stop me
thinkin' of you
as a daughter.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.243
So, tell me
what to do.

32:57.276 --> 33:01.747
First off, don't make
this thing with Donna
any bigger than it is.

33:01.780 --> 33:05.484
You two have a difference
of opinion, that's all.

33:07.786 --> 33:12.624
The only reason
I'm here in the first place
is because of you.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.393
I love you
and I owe you.

33:16.362 --> 33:20.266
But it's not
just your company.
Not anymore.

33:22.368 --> 33:26.238
You got-- you got
a special kind of talent,
sweetheart.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.507
But when you march to
the beat of your own drum,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.176
you risk
losin' the band.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.114
Lay out your vision.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.383
Find a way
to work with her.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.451
You two need each other.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.524
( sighs )

33:53.165 --> 33:55.734
- Hey, Bos?
- Hmm?

33:58.704 --> 34:00.339
I got married.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.210
( chuckles )

34:04.243 --> 34:05.544
Congratulations.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.549
( keys clicking )

34:18.424 --> 34:20.326
( sighs )

34:37.176 --> 34:39.077
Whew.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.366
( whirrs )

35:07.806 --> 35:09.808
( crackles )

35:14.746 --> 35:17.416
You do realize
you have a party going on?
This can't wait?

35:17.449 --> 35:19.851
No. Please sit down.

35:19.885 --> 35:23.155
( music playing )

35:31.497 --> 35:33.532
Ahem.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.841
I've had some concerns

35:42.874 --> 35:45.744
about Mutiny's
direction,

35:45.777 --> 35:49.215
concerns I haven't
effectively expressed.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.351
That's on me.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.486
Things
are moving fast,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.888
faster than I ever
imagined they would.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.325
It's an exciting time.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.361
But we are
at a crossroads

36:02.394 --> 36:05.864
and we have a decision
to make... together.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.667
I know you all want
to move forward on the IPO.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.969
I do, too.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.939
But I don't think
rushing into it is in
our best interests.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.708
- Can I say a quick word?
- Mm-hmm.

36:16.742 --> 36:20.879
The company is valued
for what it is
and does right now.

36:20.912 --> 36:25.717
The market likes Mutiny,
but in a year or two,

36:25.751 --> 36:28.320
or however long it takes
to implement the changes

36:28.354 --> 36:31.590
you have in mind,
who knows?

36:31.623 --> 36:35.227
We can't count
on tomorrow's landscape
looking like today's.

36:35.261 --> 36:39.331
Mutiny isn't sustainable
as it exists now.

36:39.365 --> 36:42.301
Our whole user base
is tied to the Commodore 64.

36:42.334 --> 36:45.371
We need to diversify
to other platforms
in order to grow.

36:45.404 --> 36:48.340
And isn't that
what Wall Street likes?
Growth?

36:48.374 --> 36:50.876
The kind of investment
that I'm talking about

36:50.909 --> 36:53.345
in time and money
will pay off

36:53.379 --> 36:54.880
and smart investors
will see that.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.882
Your ideas are good,
Cameron,

36:56.915 --> 36:58.484
and some of them
are even great.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.852
And I want to
explore them with you,
all of them.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.522
- Mm-hmm.
- But why can't
we do that

37:03.555 --> 37:05.991
after we've gone
public?

37:06.024 --> 37:09.595
We don't have to wait
to try and make
something perfect.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.997
Perfect is
the enemy of good,

37:12.030 --> 37:15.434
and Mutiny is very,
very good right now
as it is.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.736
Donna, have you been
on SwapMeet lately?

37:17.769 --> 37:20.739
It's like
an 8-bit mall.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.009
It's lost what made it
a community.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.744
We need to make it
feel alive again

37:25.777 --> 37:27.579
or people
are going to leave

37:27.613 --> 37:29.615
and we'll just be hosting
a bunch of tacky businesses

37:29.648 --> 37:32.718
- selling junk
to nobody.
- But--

37:32.751 --> 37:34.486
Please.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.488
We can't afford
to be naive here.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.823
If we put off
these changes,

37:37.856 --> 37:39.825
we won't be able to
make them the right way.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.460
You mean your way.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.029
I mean, we'll be
so focused on PE ratios

37:44.062 --> 37:45.797
and shareholder value,

37:45.831 --> 37:48.434
that we won't
be able to innovate
and respond quickly.

37:48.467 --> 37:52.371
Mutiny won't be
Mutiny anymore.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.673
We'll lose
the company's soul.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.310
Donna:
Say we do it your way.

37:58.344 --> 38:01.447
What happens if your ideas,
good as they are,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.715
don't work
or backfire?

38:03.749 --> 38:06.918
We risk losing
our current valuation.

38:06.952 --> 38:10.055
Going public doesn't mean
we stop innovating.

38:10.088 --> 38:14.059
We can continue
to experiment and
improve as we go,

38:14.092 --> 38:17.062
especially with someone
as brilliant as you
leading the way.

38:17.095 --> 38:20.432
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not patronizing you.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.969
You're handling me
like you always do,
and I'm sick of it.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.072
Listen,
I'm trying to explain
some very real risks

38:27.105 --> 38:28.807
that you're not willing
to acknowledge

38:28.840 --> 38:31.543
to actual stakeholders
in the company.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.545
We can't afford
to be impulsive here.

38:33.579 --> 38:36.014
You're calling me
impulsive? Wow.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.749
What's that
supposed to mean?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.551
I think people
are out there celebrating
what that means.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.687
Oh, you mean
that bullshit little
party you threw

38:41.720 --> 38:43.689
to distract me
from getting stabbed
in the back?

38:43.722 --> 38:44.723
- Bos: Hey.
- Diane: Okay, ladies,

38:44.756 --> 38:46.525
we are getting
off track here.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.560
Diane, it's mostly
your thoughts coming
out of her mouth,

38:48.594 --> 38:50.962
so I can't imagine
what you have to add
to the discussion.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.098
Jesus! I don't know
who should be more
insulted.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.434
Trust me,
if I'm expressing
an opinion,

38:55.467 --> 38:56.735
it's because
I believe it.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.570
I should trust you.
Yes, of course!

38:58.604 --> 38:59.838
I mean, unless
you're lying now,

38:59.871 --> 39:01.873
like you lied
about Doug and Craig.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.609
Did you know
about that?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.944
That when you told her
it was fine if I fired them,

39:05.977 --> 39:07.846
she told me that
I had to keep them on?

39:07.879 --> 39:09.715
Is that
the sort of person

39:09.748 --> 39:11.617
that you wanna trust
with this business
going forward?

39:11.650 --> 39:12.784
You mean
the kind of person

39:12.818 --> 39:14.753
who actually tries
to make things work

39:14.786 --> 39:18.023
instead of fighting
with anybody who threatens
her "savior complex"?

39:18.056 --> 39:19.458
I get along fine
with people.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.026
You alienate
everybody.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.094
Says the woman
that will take any excuse

39:23.128 --> 39:24.496
not to go home
to her husband.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.097
- Hey.
- Why don't we see

39:26.131 --> 39:27.833
if your marriage
lasts the year

39:27.866 --> 39:30.135
before you start doling out
relationship advice?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.870
- Donna?
- Enough. Enough!

39:31.903 --> 39:34.506
Hey, this meeting
is over, all right?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.409
My God!
You two go to
your corners,

39:37.443 --> 39:39.077
wipe the blood
off your mouths,

39:39.110 --> 39:41.647
- and we will revisit--
- ( slams )

39:41.680 --> 39:43.381
( men murmuring )

39:44.683 --> 39:46.418
This gets decided tonight.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.922
I want a vote,
and I want it clean.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.993
If you all decide
with Donna,

39:55.026 --> 39:57.529
then you can go ahead
and do the IPO without me.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.498
- I quit.
- Cameron, come on.

39:59.531 --> 40:04.002
No!
I'm sick of this!

40:04.035 --> 40:06.137
Go! Take a hard look
at this company

40:06.171 --> 40:08.740
and ask yourself
who made it what it is

40:08.774 --> 40:10.776
and who's just been
along for the ride!

40:10.809 --> 40:13.645
Cameron,
please don't do this.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.781
You want it?
You got it.

40:15.814 --> 40:19.751
But I will not sit by
and watch this company die

40:19.785 --> 40:22.454
because it's
being held hostage
by a petulant child.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.890
If we don't move forward
with the IPO,

40:24.923 --> 40:27.158
then you can steer this ship
into the rocks yourself,

40:27.192 --> 40:28.994
because I am
outta here.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.963
Okay, Bos is right.
Let's take a beat,
cool off--

40:31.997 --> 40:35.534
Show of hands.
Who's in favor of doing
the IPO now

40:35.567 --> 40:38.670
with all that
that entails?

41:08.033 --> 41:10.101
You're breaking
my goddamn heart.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.147
( sobs )
Oh.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.650
( gasps )

42:33.051 --> 42:33.318
( sighs )

42:39.825 --> 42:41.660
Joe?

42:41.693 --> 42:43.194
What are you
doin' here?

42:44.696 --> 42:46.898
Someone had to
drop off the keys.

42:59.377 --> 43:02.013
Welcome
to your empire.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.787
And thus concludes
the grand tour.

43:11.657 --> 43:13.291
All right,
pay attention.

43:13.324 --> 43:17.896
This is--
this is complicated.

43:17.929 --> 43:22.033
Okay, this one--
this key's for
the building.

43:22.067 --> 43:26.638
This key is for
the ladies' room,
for the men's bathroom,

43:26.672 --> 43:28.373
and those two
are for the front door.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.945
Thanks.

43:33.979 --> 43:35.180
If it wasn't
gonna be me,

43:35.213 --> 43:37.315
I'm glad it was you.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.050
Write me
from the future.

43:41.219 --> 43:45.223
- 49 percent.
- What?

43:45.256 --> 43:47.926
Come run it with me...

43:47.959 --> 43:50.662
and 49 percent
of the company's yours.

43:50.696 --> 43:52.998
That's a cruel joke,

43:53.031 --> 43:54.966
and quite frankly,
beneath you.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.902
I'm serious.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.640
49 percent.

44:12.050 --> 44:16.121
With how this looks,
we need to be smart.

44:17.455 --> 44:19.424
I should be
a silent partner.

44:20.792 --> 44:23.161
Even better.

44:23.194 --> 44:25.196
( laughs )

44:33.071 --> 44:34.973
( knocks )

44:37.442 --> 44:40.311
( footsteps approaching,
bolt clicks )

44:40.345 --> 44:44.182
- Joe.
- Ryan, today is
a big day for us.

44:44.215 --> 44:45.917
So, you've seen it
already?

44:45.951 --> 44:48.920
- Seen what?
- So, then you don't know.

44:48.954 --> 44:50.455
I released the source code
for MacMillan Utility's

44:50.488 --> 44:53.058
security software
to the public.

44:53.091 --> 44:55.260
- What are you
talking about?
- It's free, Joe.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.062
Really free,
like we always wanted.

44:57.095 --> 44:58.730
People can tinker with it,
they can make it better--

44:58.764 --> 45:00.365
or worse,
that can happen, too.

45:00.398 --> 45:01.900
The point is
MacMillan Utility

45:01.933 --> 45:03.301
can no longer
profit off of it.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.103
Joe:
But that's illegal.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.105
And I released
documents to the media

45:07.138 --> 45:09.140
proving that
MacMillan Utility

45:09.174 --> 45:11.977
was totally on board
with charging the public
for 2.0 all along,

45:12.010 --> 45:14.245
and they only went after you
when you tried to stop them.

45:14.279 --> 45:16.848
Yeah, it shows
that they weren't trying
the protect people

45:16.882 --> 45:17.983
or-- or keep them safe.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.752
They were just
going to exploit them.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.855
And I laid out
for the media

45:23.889 --> 45:26.024
how you lost your job
defending your ideals.

45:28.426 --> 45:30.361
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

45:30.395 --> 45:34.132
Yes! I returned volley
just like you wanted.

45:34.165 --> 45:36.434
It's gonna
take those bastards
years to recover.

45:38.303 --> 45:39.838
They are gonna
come after you.

45:39.871 --> 45:42.273
( sighs )
I'm not stupid, Joe.

45:42.307 --> 45:45.143
I covered every
conceivable track.

45:45.176 --> 45:48.279
They will
never catch me.
I am that good.

45:48.313 --> 45:51.149
Yeah, nobody's
that good.

45:51.182 --> 45:52.784
I am.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.408
( instrumental music
playing )
