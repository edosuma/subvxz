00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.606
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:10.576
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.447 --> 00:49.515
Hi. I'm Will Tippin.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.516
David McNeil.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.317
So why are we sitting here?

00:52.318 --> 00:54.086
I'm researching something.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.754
It's called SD-6.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.023
I don't have anything
to say about that.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.686
Why don't you just tell me
what you know?

01:02.762 --> 01:04.495
It's been a mystery
within the agency

01:04.497 --> 01:05.697
for over two decades...

01:05.698 --> 01:08.133
who murdered
those CIA officers.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.634
We have our answer now.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.072
It was your father.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.307
And I'm gonna report him.

01:15.308 --> 01:19.074
Those cyrillic codes
you found in those books...

01:19.712 --> 01:22.545
Yes, they were orders
from the KGB.

01:22.615 --> 01:26.107
And, yes,
they were orders to kill.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.780
Including your father,
Mr. Vaughn.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.916
But, Sydney,
I was not that agent.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.593
Your mother was.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

01:44.471 --> 01:46.839
Sydney!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.707
Wait!

01:48.708 --> 01:50.809
You can't lose control
over this.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.911
This is not the best time
to start lecturing me.

01:52.912 --> 01:54.713
- I know how this feels.
- Not exactly.

01:54.714 --> 01:57.049
You've had a lot longer
to make sense of this.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.985
There was a time when this
was news to me, too.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.252
Your mother was sent
to the United States

02:04.324 --> 02:07.691
to steal secrets from
a ranking officer of the CIA.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.752
How she and I
happened to meet.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.330
How she supposedly
fell in love.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.368
I thought it was all true.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.604
But it was just a setup.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.799
Even her wanting
to have a family?

02:23.910 --> 02:26.879
Or was that just part
of the plan, too?

02:35.355 --> 02:39.121
<i># My life goes on #</i>

02:39.192 --> 02:43.458
<i># In endless song #</i>

02:43.530 --> 02:50.299
<i># Above earth's lamentation #</i>

02:50.403 --> 02:53.338
<i># I hear the real #</i>

02:53.406 --> 02:58.343
<i># Though far-off hymn #</i>

02:58.444 --> 03:05.748
<i># That hails a new creation #</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.755
There's something that happens

03:09.756 --> 03:12.256
when you discover the truth
about someone.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.026
I know a little about this.

03:14.027 --> 03:19.624
<i># I hear its music ringing #</i>

03:19.699 --> 03:22.429
The truth changes everything.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.374
There's this woman.

03:28.441 --> 03:32.207
Her personality like a collage
I've put together

03:32.278 --> 03:35.679
from the photographs,
and the few memories I have,

03:35.748 --> 03:38.217
the scraps of stories
I've heard,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.846
the clothes of hers I've got.

03:42.755 --> 03:45.255
Her books.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.328
And none of it's real.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.763
She wasn't that woman at all.

03:58.871 --> 04:01.431
She was a horrible person...

04:05.678 --> 04:08.178
...who killed your father.

04:12.452 --> 04:16.445
Vaughn, I just wanted
to say...

04:19.726 --> 04:22.226
...that I'm so sorry.

04:26.466 --> 04:33.395
<i># How can I keep
from singing? #</i>

05:12.612 --> 05:14.279
This is Unit 11.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.682
I've got Code 4.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.717
We've lost coverage
on the off-site garage.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.285
Any signs of forced entry?

05:20.286 --> 05:22.786
Negative from gate control.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.917
I'll check it out.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.492
Grab me a black coffee.
Two sugars.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.917
You know about any A.C. Repairs?

05:56.589 --> 05:59.089
Negative.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.338
I don't want this job anymore.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.507
Sydney, that's why
you're doing what you do.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.008
You're helping
bring an end to SD-6.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.773
- Not anymore.
- Sydney.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.347
I need someone in my life
to be real.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.784
This, right here, is real.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.386
Look where we are.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.388
This isn't real.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.847
This isn't
what we should be doing.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.894
- I want out.
- Out?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.701
You want to enter
the protection program?

06:42.702 --> 06:45.330
No.
I'm not going into hiding.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.032
If you don't,
Sloane will kill you.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.641
I don't think he will.

06:56.649 --> 06:59.017
You like hockey, right?
The Kings?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.420
- Yeah. How'd you...
- The pen in your briefcase.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.587
It's a Kings pen.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.622
Yeah, I got that at...

07:03.623 --> 07:06.421
They're playing
the Islanders next week.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.992
We should go.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.200
Sydney, you can't do this.

07:24.977 --> 07:27.912
Here's the appeal filed
by McNeil's lawyer last year.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.581
And I found out that SD-6

07:29.582 --> 07:31.950
is an ingredient
in artificial sweeteners.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.614
But that's probably not the SD-6
that you're talking about.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.316
- Does my voice annoy you?
- Your voice?

07:38.391 --> 07:41.326
Yeah, I was going over this
interview with Eloise Kurtz.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.662
I started thinking about McNeil
and this look in his eyes

07:43.663 --> 07:44.830
when I was interviewing him.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.098
His lawyer, the same thing.

07:47.099 --> 07:50.068
You're a journalist.
You get paid to be annoying.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.866
- So you say I'm annoying.
- Not to Danny or Eloise Kurtz.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.139
So I don't annoy dead people?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.507
You're their champion.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.676
What am I doing
if I'm hurting the people?

07:57.677 --> 08:00.011
If I could bring back
Danny Hecht and Eloise Kurtz,

08:00.012 --> 08:02.113
I would, but I can't.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.449
And if championing them
is gonna cause

08:04.450 --> 08:06.918
David McNeil's daughter
to be in danger,

08:06.919 --> 08:09.419
I can't live with that.

08:09.856 --> 08:13.587
I don't think I can do
this SD-6 story.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.561
I'm out.

08:31.544 --> 08:34.044
We're right on time.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.046
<i># Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches #</i>

08:44.123 --> 08:48.583
<i># I slam in the back
of my Dragula #</i>

08:48.661 --> 08:51.687
<i># Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches #</i>

09:03.175 --> 09:05.675
How do I look?

09:34.707 --> 09:37.699
Will you get me my wife's doctor
on the phone, please?

09:39.211 --> 09:41.711
Yeah.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.715
Dr. Mendelsohn
is on line one.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.526
Sir?

09:58.898 --> 10:01.398
Sir?

10:15.481 --> 10:16.681
Hey, beautiful.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.947
Why don't you turn
that frown upside down?

11:19.045 --> 11:21.545
Sydney.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.047
Sydney!

11:24.216 --> 11:26.418
- This is suicide.
- I don't think it is.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.919
What exactly is
your exit strategy here?

11:28.988 --> 11:31.718
Politely asking Sloane
to let you out of SD-6?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.758
Based on Sloane's behavior
toward me.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.127
Protecting me at Dinatti Park,
assaulting Russek.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.858
Sloane answers to people.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.899
People who don't know
or care about you.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.534
If he lets you go...

11:42.535 --> 11:45.368
those people will eliminate
him and you.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.211
Cole.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.918
Those people Sloane works for,
The Alliance,

11:59.919 --> 12:01.553
if they believe
you've abandoned them...

12:01.554 --> 12:03.755
they will kill anyone
they think you've talked to.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.023
Your roommate, Francie.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.524
That reporter friend
of yours. Anyone.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.896
Hello, this is Unit 11.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.333
On that Code 4...

12:15.401 --> 12:18.302
Let me guess.
You forgot the two sugars.

12:23.809 --> 12:27.210
We have a physical breach.
Start lockdown procedure now.

12:27.279 --> 12:30.146
Sure thing, Arvin.
Whatever you say.

12:31.817 --> 12:34.615
I felt this way before
I learned about my mother.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.354
This life has to stop.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.325
Dead.

13:14.326 --> 13:17.318
But a blackout wouldn't
shut down security.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.517
Tippin.

13:39.518 --> 13:42.018
Go to your desk.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.023
I'm off the story.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.391
Leave the
bathroom and go to your desk.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.278
Will Tippin's office.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.113
Um, yeah, he's right here.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.782
Some guy. Totally nasal.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.483
Clips on the housing story.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.578
Litvack wants 2,000 words
by noon tomorrow.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.625
Hello?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.794
Man: There is
something inside the envelope

14:22.795 --> 14:24.963
that will make McNeil talk.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.397
I don't want to make him talk.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.466
You said
you didn't scare easily.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.163
If you're so brave,
how about losing the voice box

14:31.270 --> 14:33.770
and telling me your name?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.373
Don't call me again.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.290
Five minutes ahead.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.865
Get 'em wrapped up, baby!

15:03.369 --> 15:04.936
Chopper.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.738
Secure the elevator.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.406
You got the scanning room
door codes?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.907
Got it.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.383
You've got to stay down.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.444
- You jammin'?
- I'm jammin'.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.362
Want to get a pizza?
That new place?

15:31.363 --> 15:33.863
No, thanks.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.677
Sydney wants to quit SD-6.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.274
Which she knows
she just can't do.

15:58.691 --> 16:04.095
It's a weird thing,
learning how your father died.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.024
It's always been
this intellectual idea I had.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.667
Knowing he died.

16:09.668 --> 16:13.126
Just not having any details.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.568
You really want some space
or are we gonna get drunk?

16:17.676 --> 16:18.843
There's this bar.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.645
You won't even
remember it tomorrow.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.146
Hey.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.951
What a day, huh?

16:26.952 --> 16:28.519
Why do you say that?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.955
Come on. Bristow's mom.
Your dad.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.457
It's not like a secret
around here.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.592
Vaughn. That really sucks.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.561
- Well put.
- You know what I think?

16:36.562 --> 16:38.463
Barnett's gonna be good
for you.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.797
I'm not seeing Barnett.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.632
Oh, yeah, you are.
She wants to see you.

16:41.633 --> 16:44.227
Come on.
You're Bristow's handler.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.337
You find out her mom
killed your dad.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.773
She's a shrink.
She lives for crisis management.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.274
I think she'll be good for you.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.672
I like thick crust,
in case you wanted me to come.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.248
Oh, hey, we don't.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.755
Did you know about Barnett?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.898
Still can't get a signal.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.460
Whoever's down there could be
jamming the frequencies.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.440
Emergency lockdown procedures.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.344
The elevator is returning
to SD-6.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.845
The doors
will automatically open.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.042
Elevator secure.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.858
The advantages
of high-level clearance.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.359
Let's go.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.101
How could K-Directorate
overpower 50 trained agents?

19:07.212 --> 19:09.313
If K-Directorate attacks SD-6,

19:09.314 --> 19:12.010
they know SD-6
will return the favor.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.218
This team that's invaded SD-6

19:14.219 --> 19:16.320
isn't working
with any organization we know.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.821
My guess is they're working
for a group

19:18.857 --> 19:21.357
clearly unpredictable
and dangerous.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.395
Hand me that cable.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.198
Now plug it in.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.649
There are 600 cameras
hidden throughout SD-6.

19:47.819 --> 19:50.319
Oh, my God.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.791
Look at that hardware.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.227
Latest military spec.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.958
Extended magazines,
compensators, laser sights.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.001
- I see four.
- There's a fifth.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.712
I want to talk to you.
That's the sick part.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.952
Catch up and stuff.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.683
So much has happened
these last five years.

20:23.755 --> 20:27.748
And this place hasn't changed.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.493
But you...

20:29.494 --> 20:32.054
you look...

20:32.130 --> 20:34.131
older?

20:34.132 --> 20:35.566
But that's good.

20:35.567 --> 20:39.230
Your hair looks good.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.474
Do you know
what the worst part is?

20:46.211 --> 20:50.011
Being left for dead
in Grozny, Arvin.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.983
Well, you're going to learn
the worst part.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.611
But another part that sucks

20:55.687 --> 20:57.421
is seeing
guys you worked with,

20:57.422 --> 21:00.789
guys you thought
were tougher than deer jerky,

21:00.859 --> 21:03.359
tortured to death.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.130
That's no good.

21:06.131 --> 21:11.467
The most ironical part for me
is we did the damn job.

21:12.804 --> 21:16.934
We blew that pipeline to hell
first night we landed.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.542
But you know me, Arvin.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.678
- Do you know this guy?
- I know the operation.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.204
Sloane in '96
sent a team to Chechnya

21:23.282 --> 21:24.782
to destroy
the Shelhemil pipeline.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.751
There were complications.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.312
The team was captured
by the Russians.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.555
And if that chopper
had have been

21:31.556 --> 21:34.389
where the hell
you know it should have been...

21:36.194 --> 21:40.631
...my whole life would have
taken a different direction.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.199
- What do you want?
- Well...

21:44.136 --> 21:48.038
I got this really kick-ass
new job.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.768
See, I'm working for this
gentleman they call "The Man. "

21:50.876 --> 21:54.175
You will learn about The Man.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.347
What The Man wants

21:56.348 --> 21:58.482
is a certain
little somethin'- somethin'

21:58.483 --> 22:01.247
you got in the SD-6 vault.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.321
Not only is the vault secure,

22:07.392 --> 22:10.418
the vault access room
is locked now, too.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.963
Oh, don't worry
about the vault access room.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.432
We're taking care of that.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.933
What I need is
the combination to the vault.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.808
Not a chance.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.946
That's cool.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.085
You still got that room
downstairs, right?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.253
The Conversation Room?

22:36.254 --> 22:38.754
That's what you used to
call it, right?

22:39.958 --> 22:42.193
The torture rooms.
Like you really got to admit

22:42.194 --> 22:45.061
what the hell it is
you're doing down there.

22:45.130 --> 22:50.227
So, Arvin, let's go
to the Conversation Room.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.139
Check this out.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.707
People victimized by a developer

22:56.708 --> 22:58.376
who's using
his political connections

22:58.377 --> 22:59.977
to have their homes
condemned by the city.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.478
Now, we go in, shed a little
light on the subject,

23:02.547 --> 23:05.015
protect the little guy,
and no one gets hurt.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.318
I'm gonna go interview
the developer right now.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.353
So no more McNeil?

23:09.354 --> 23:11.422
Nope.

23:11.423 --> 23:14.119
Hmm. Interesting.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.838
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.899
- Michael Vaughn. We've met.
- I remember. Judy Barnett.

23:31.009 --> 23:32.576
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

23:32.577 --> 23:35.808
- You got my voice mail?
- Yeah.

23:36.882 --> 23:40.443
I want you to know I've got
nothing against shrinks.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.453
Well, good.

23:42.454 --> 23:45.082
But I think this might
be a waste of time.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.557
You wanted to see me because

23:46.558 --> 23:49.026
Sydney Bristow's mother
was a KGB operative

23:49.027 --> 23:50.928
who killed my father,
among others.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.523
- Yes.
- Which is not ideal news.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.332
Obviously.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.901
And, yes, it's emotional,

23:56.902 --> 23:58.936
but I already knew
he was killed.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.735
It happened almost
20 years ago, you know?

24:01.807 --> 24:05.265
So I really don't think
I require crisis management.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.844
There's no crisis.

24:06.845 --> 24:10.872
Everything you say to me,
I will keep confidential.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.185
Okay.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.886
I wanted to talk to you

24:15.887 --> 24:19.721
about your relationship
with Ms. Bristow.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.385
How often do you meet
with Sydney?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.862
Uh, a couple times a week.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.363
Three or four, sometimes.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.864
Only about operations.

24:28.867 --> 24:30.501
Uh...

24:30.502 --> 24:32.169
We have met on occasion

24:32.170 --> 24:34.238
when Sydney wanted
to talk to me

24:34.239 --> 24:35.606
about what was happening
within SD-6

24:35.607 --> 24:36.941
or regarding her father

24:36.942 --> 24:38.609
when she believed
he was a KGB agent

24:38.610 --> 24:39.743
and not her mother.

24:39.744 --> 24:42.440
You and Sydney
have a friendship.

24:43.882 --> 24:45.382
She needs someone to talk to.

24:45.383 --> 24:47.117
I'd think
you'd appreciate that.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.453
I'm the only person
she can confide in.

24:49.454 --> 24:51.856
So you feel
that your relationship

24:51.857 --> 24:54.417
with Ms. Bristow
is fully appropriate,

24:54.493 --> 24:56.861
that it falls
within the guidelines

24:56.862 --> 24:58.496
of agent and handler?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.931
What are you asking me?

25:00.932 --> 25:03.901
I have gotten some reports
about your behavior.

25:03.969 --> 25:04.835
From who?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.670
After the incident in Tuscany,

25:06.671 --> 25:09.731
when you sent in an extraction
team to protect Sydney,

25:09.841 --> 25:11.509
I've been following your work.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.543
Mostly very good.

25:12.544 --> 25:14.645
Thank you.
That's very nice.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.809
Did you purchase a Christmas
present for Agent Bristow?

25:27.759 --> 25:30.489
I'm not familiar,
uh, Dr. Barnett,

25:30.562 --> 25:34.396
with the regulations, uh,
preventing officers

25:34.466 --> 25:36.033
from observing,
with their co-workers,

25:36.034 --> 25:39.003
a fairly widely recognized
holiday such as Christmas.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.839
May I ask you
what the gift was?

25:41.840 --> 25:43.541
I'd like you to tell me
who's been reporting me.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.608
I can't do that.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.109
Then I'm just gonna
have to guess.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.713
Endo, what's up?
Where are we? I need status.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.283
Almost done drilling.

25:54.352 --> 25:57.048
Then we'll start
packing explosives.

26:02.193 --> 26:05.094
Those other two,
where the hell did they go?

26:12.537 --> 26:15.199
We should be in the vault room
in 10 minutes.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.807
10 minutes. What are they
going for in the vault?

26:17.809 --> 26:19.476
Could be anything.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.779
Sloane was planning
on sending you to Taiwan.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.247
FTL acquired
some Scud launchers.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.049
He wants me to scramble
their launch codes.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.884
Marshall was working
on a scrambling device.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.786
- Have you seen it?
- He showed it to me last week.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.387
- What does it look like?
- Why?

26:30.388 --> 26:32.756
Sloane must have activated
the emergency failsafe.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.726
There are 500 pounds of C-4
strategically placed

26:35.794 --> 26:37.528
within the substructure
of this building.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.157
Opening the vault
will trigger that C-4.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.466
All underground levels
will collapse,

26:42.467 --> 26:43.801
burying any evidence

26:43.802 --> 26:46.532
that the Los Angeles cell
of SD-6 ever existed.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.138
You want to scramble
the vault codes.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.379
Can you see the scrambler
in Marshall's office?

27:02.053 --> 27:04.288
There. It's that compact
on his desk.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.956
It's not far
from the air vent.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.858
Getting into his office
is too much of a risk.

27:11.596 --> 27:14.096
So, then...

27:15.834 --> 27:18.334
We fish for it.

27:19.070 --> 27:23.097
They took us
to their base in Hankala.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.507
After 38 straight days
of beatings,

27:26.578 --> 27:28.812
they finally got around
to interrogating me.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.281
They took me into a room.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.684
They tied me to a chair.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.711
They asked me questions
about Islamic rebels.

27:36.788 --> 27:39.156
They wanted to know where they
were keeping Russian P.O.W.s.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.388
I told them, "I'm just
a kid from Redondo Beach

27:42.460 --> 27:44.828
running black ops for Uncle Sam.

27:44.829 --> 27:48.094
Get it?
I'm an American citizen. "

27:48.166 --> 27:50.234
Well, that senior
Russian officer

27:50.235 --> 27:52.965
didn't want any piece
of that kind of action.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.872
He had the KGB
contact Langley

27:54.873 --> 27:57.007
through both
front and back channels.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.602
CIA claimed
they never heard of me.

28:00.545 --> 28:02.813
They denied all knowledge

28:02.814 --> 28:06.250
of any operative
by the name of McKenas Cole.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.821
So when that Russian
got off the phone,

28:10.822 --> 28:12.690
he was so pissed.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.650
He was so insane with rage.

28:18.730 --> 28:21.098
That was when
he showed me this.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.599
Baby?

28:34.345 --> 28:35.946
Watch the security feeds.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.447
If I'm caught, get out
through the elevator shaft.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.751
Dad, wait.
You're not doing this.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.052
- Of course I am.
- No.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.021
You're gonna have to crawl
through a maze of air shafts,

28:44.022 --> 28:45.622
get to Marshall's office,
get the scrambler,

28:45.623 --> 28:47.291
get to the vault room,
and scramble the code

28:47.292 --> 28:48.292
all in under 10 minutes.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.793
No offense,
but I am doing this.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.393
You'll have to find
your way to the vault.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.467
Use the scrambler.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.001
I know how to use a scrambler.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.597
I can't believe, of all things,
we're saving SD-6.

29:23.828 --> 29:26.558
Want to see what's inside?

29:26.631 --> 29:29.131
I know you do.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.767
I'll open it.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.937
You want me to?

29:39.043 --> 29:41.345
You're gonna give me

29:41.346 --> 29:44.440
the combination
to the SD-6 vault.

29:44.516 --> 29:48.384
If you don't,
I'm going to open this box.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.887
And, Arvin...

29:52.090 --> 29:54.718
Trust me when I tell you...

29:54.793 --> 29:56.860
you do not want me...

29:56.861 --> 30:00.297
to open this box.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.549
- Will Tippin?
- Yeah.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.783
Oh, thank God.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.119
You're the third guy
I've introduced myself to.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.054
Ma√Ætre d's starting
to give me an evil look.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.756
Uh, I'm sorry.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.351
Are you with
Carla D'Angelo's office?

30:29.761 --> 30:32.162
- Who?
- The developer.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.031
The woman I'm supposed to
meet here.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.132
On my voice mail,

30:35.133 --> 30:37.134
you said you were working
on a story about my dad.

30:37.135 --> 30:39.236
About your dad?

30:39.237 --> 30:41.737
Yeah. David McNeil?

30:49.414 --> 30:51.048
I, uh...

30:51.049 --> 30:53.549
I never called you.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.518
Now, I don't know
what you know.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.889
What happened with my father?
I know everything.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.324
Well, we never talked.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.526
Okay, maybe,
but we're talking now.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.027
No. This right here,
this never happened.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.930
Your dad, I don't know him.
He seems like a good guy.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.233
He is.
He's the best.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.968
I think he knows what's best.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.303
He does not want
you and I talking.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.739
Well, then, who does?

31:15.740 --> 31:18.240
Goodbye.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.609
What the hell is your problem?
Reporting me?

31:27.685 --> 31:29.786
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.

31:29.787 --> 31:32.022
My business
is not your business.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.624
I'm looking out for
the good of the agency.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.859
- Then you should quit.
- Stay out of my way.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.060
Did it make you feel better

31:37.061 --> 31:38.795
telling Barnett that I got
Sydney a Christmas gift?

31:38.796 --> 31:40.397
You're too emotionally
attached to that woman.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.026
Like you would know about being
emotionally attached to a woman.

31:43.101 --> 31:45.601
- Your judgment's impaired.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.271
- You're out of line.
- You're out of line.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.772
You stay the hell out
of my operations.

31:49.774 --> 31:52.274
Who's out of control,
Vaughn? Me?

31:52.277 --> 31:54.611
Did you see that?
Did everyone see that?

31:54.612 --> 31:57.112
That's what I'm talking about.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.873
No, come on.

33:42.086 --> 33:45.544
Explosives in place.
Activating detonator.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.576
- We're in.
- Excellent!

34:40.678 --> 34:43.178
All right, Arvin,
here's the deal.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.315
We are in the vault room.

34:45.315 --> 34:46.449
Two things.

34:46.451 --> 34:50.114
One. You don't give us
the codes...

34:50.188 --> 34:51.420
we got the tech to get in.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.690
It'll just take a while.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.158
And two.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.821
You give us the codes,
I won't have to open the box.

34:57.895 --> 35:00.625
Which would be
really excellent for you.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.835
I can't be the first person
to have difficulty

35:04.836 --> 35:07.336
taking you seriously, can I?

35:08.539 --> 35:13.306
Well, while that was
a moderately clever retort...

35:15.012 --> 35:17.512
I'm the man holding the box.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.690
Have you ever
regretted being born?

35:36.334 --> 35:40.202
That's a pretty
heavy thing to experience.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.807
The regret...

35:43.808 --> 35:46.572
of having emerged
from your mother's womb.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.374
I mean, I've had
some dark days, but...

35:49.447 --> 35:53.008
nothing close to regretting
the day I was born.

35:53.084 --> 35:55.584
Until I met...

36:01.726 --> 36:04.226
"Needles of fire. "

36:22.480 --> 36:24.980
No, Sydney, don't.
Don't.

36:37.995 --> 36:40.495
Come on.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.923
Good. Good.

37:30.448 --> 37:33.679
We need some help!
This guy's having a seizure!

37:33.751 --> 37:36.618
Ice, where the hell are you?

37:47.598 --> 37:49.466
I heard something back there.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.967
I'm gonna go
and check it out.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.304
Um, excuse me.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.508
As luck would have it,
I'm feeling kind of

37:58.509 --> 38:01.009
a Stockholm-syndrome thing
happening.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.295
There's this little
cajun food place

38:18.296 --> 38:20.363
in Abita Springs, Louisiana.

38:20.364 --> 38:21.831
It's called Rockamore's.

38:21.832 --> 38:23.833
You know what
they're famous for?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.869
For making people cry.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.904
You know what makes them cry?

38:27.905 --> 38:29.205
The hot sauce.

38:29.206 --> 38:31.834
And no one knows how
they get that crap so hot.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.105
Legend has it that the Devil
comes by once a month

38:35.179 --> 38:36.880
and spits in their frying pan.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.475
Point being...

38:39.550 --> 38:42.050
the hot sauce at Rockamore's

38:42.086 --> 38:44.884
is like a fluffy
vanilla ice-cream cone

38:44.955 --> 38:48.550
when compared
to what's in these.

38:49.327 --> 38:53.093
Each one is like you took
a bag of red jalape√±os,

38:53.164 --> 38:55.962
threw 'em in a blender...

38:56.033 --> 38:58.533
and used them for an enema.

38:59.403 --> 39:01.903
And, Arvin...

39:01.939 --> 39:04.439
you're about to get to know 'em.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.548
These needles...

39:13.551 --> 39:16.051
They're a whole lot of no fun.

39:29.767 --> 39:32.267
Wait.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.204
You have to have a pen.

39:44.615 --> 39:47.115
Hey. I know you said
you don't want to talk...

39:47.184 --> 39:49.018
I don't think that we should.

39:49.019 --> 39:51.852
Fine. Whatever.
Then just listen, please.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.949
What I said before
about knowing everything...

39:56.026 --> 39:58.194
that's not true, okay?

39:58.195 --> 40:00.063
I don't know what SD-6 is.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.132
I don't know why
the people who are a part of it

40:02.133 --> 40:04.534
destroyed my life.

40:04.535 --> 40:07.402
All I do know is that
they killed my mother

40:07.505 --> 40:10.406
and framed my father.

40:10.474 --> 40:12.709
Every time I say that,
it's like,

40:12.710 --> 40:15.078
do people really exist
who do things like that?

40:15.079 --> 40:17.013
And if they do, isn't it

40:17.014 --> 40:19.149
our obligation
to do something about it?

40:19.150 --> 40:22.347
Not if doing it's gonna make
more innocent people get hurt.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.721
Which is why I'm here.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.222
See, I know my dad
won't talk

40:27.291 --> 40:28.425
because he's afraid

40:28.426 --> 40:30.760
that something bad
will happen to me if he does.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.362
Yeah.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.957
Robert Stoller,
my godfather,

40:35.032 --> 40:36.833
knows some people
who can send me away.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.496
Somewhere where they're
never gonna find me.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.570
I'll be safe,

40:40.571 --> 40:43.071
so my dad won't have to
be afraid anymore.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.342
I'm gonna go away.
Now, tomorrow.

40:46.343 --> 40:50.211
Whenever I know that someone
is fighting for my father.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.781
So please...

40:52.850 --> 40:55.051
if you can...

40:55.052 --> 40:57.552
...just help my father.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.691
Please.

41:40.030 --> 41:42.298
8... 5...

41:42.299 --> 41:44.067
9...

41:44.068 --> 41:46.135
and 3.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.636
And 3.

41:52.142 --> 41:55.305
Now, it takes the powder
a few minutes to kick in.

41:55.379 --> 41:57.879
I can always take it out.

41:57.948 --> 42:01.315
So, Arvin, why don't you
give us the real combination?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.192
<i># You #</i>

42:09.193 --> 42:11.160
<i># Bad girls #</i>

42:11.161 --> 42:12.629
<i># Go to it #</i>

42:12.630 --> 42:14.364
<i># Hell #</i>

42:14.365 --> 42:16.099
<i># Do you go? #</i>

42:16.100 --> 42:17.967
<i># Bad girls #</i>

42:17.968 --> 42:19.369
<i># Go to it #</i>

42:19.370 --> 42:21.870
<i># Hell #</i>

42:23.207 --> 42:25.707
Where are you?

43:29.373 --> 43:30.373
3.

43:31.875 --> 43:34.143
Access denied.

43:34.144 --> 43:34.844
Sloane!

43:57.301 --> 43:59.801
Target out of range.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.637
Go get 'em.
