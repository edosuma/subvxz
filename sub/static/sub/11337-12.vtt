WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:07.573
You're gonna show me
that you're still a guy
that I can trust.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.141
I told you, when
the time's right,

00:09.143 --> 00:10.642
I'll do...
The time
is right now!

00:10.644 --> 00:12.311
There needs to be retribution.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.381
They're gonna die anyway;
might as well be by you.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.249
Bravo Team,
what's your ETA on B Ward?

00:17.251 --> 00:18.250
Minutes, boss.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.284
We've got seconds.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.619
We've got to get
to the hostages

00:20.621 --> 00:22.187
before they do.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.189
She is gonna keep you in here
as long as she lives.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.758
You do this now. Finish it.
No one knows it's you.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.294
She doesn't show up at
your parole board hearings.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.397
It's your shot
to get out.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.765
No.
No.

00:32.767 --> 00:36.268
Let me put it another way:
You kill her,

00:36.270 --> 00:38.303
or I kill you. Your choice.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.405
(screaming)

00:39.407 --> 00:43.709

  CBS

00:50.317 --> 00:53.218
So, Anton Burrows,

00:53.220 --> 00:55.220
you've been incarcerated now
for 15 years,

00:55.222 --> 00:58.290
and this is your fourth appeal
for parole, is that right?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.292
Yes, ma'am.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.827
And you feel you've
been rehabilitated?

01:01.829 --> 01:03.128
I've tried.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.196
Tried?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.531
What, Mr. Burrows?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.332
To understand, ma'am,

01:07.334 --> 01:09.468
what I did.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.403
So I can l-learn from it,

01:11.405 --> 01:13.472
be a better person.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.441
(scoffs)

01:15.443 --> 01:18.243
It says here that you have
become something of an artist.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.511
Participation
in therapeutic activities--

01:19.513 --> 01:20.779
that's very positive.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.614
Yes, it is.

01:22.616 --> 01:26.251
Do you have something
you could show us?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.554
I-I'd rather not.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.689
All right.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.157
I-I brought something, uh...

01:32.159 --> 01:33.392
A statement.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.294
Go ahead.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.498
"To the Amiri family.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.368
"There are no words that
can express how sorry I am

01:43.370 --> 01:45.704
"for what I did
to your family

01:45.706 --> 01:47.539
"and to Mr. Amiri.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.741
"I know and you
know that...

01:49.743 --> 01:54.246
"there's nothing I can say or do

01:54.248 --> 01:56.381
that will bring Mr. Amiri back."

01:56.383 --> 01:59.451
I want you to know
that I-I'd do anything

01:59.453 --> 02:03.388
if I could go back and change
what happened that day.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.557
Miss Amiri,
this parole board has

02:05.559 --> 02:08.127
all of your letters on record
describing the pain

02:08.129 --> 02:10.362
that your family has suffered
since Mr. Burrows's crime.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.114
Is there any further statement

02:12.115 --> 02:13.865
that you would like to make
at this time regarding

02:13.868 --> 02:16.635
Mr. Burrows's request
for parole?

02:23.444 --> 02:27.312
What I would like to say...

02:27.314 --> 02:29.448
I can't.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.151
Not in front of my mother.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.354
I congratulate
Mr. Burrows

02:35.356 --> 02:37.823
on his success
in the visual arts,

02:37.825 --> 02:41.760
and on his performance
for us today.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.164
He says he's changed?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.933
That's nice.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.302
We haven't.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.572
In 15 years, it's
been the same life,

02:53.574 --> 02:57.209
the same feeling day after day.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.312
I had so little time
with my father,
I can barely remember

03:00.314 --> 03:01.580
what he looks like.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.949
But I know he
was a kind man,

03:03.951 --> 03:07.286
a gentle man, and he
was slaughtered by this...

03:07.288 --> 03:08.587
animal.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.857
I want him
to die, alone,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.226
like my father did.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.594
Y-You don't know what happened.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.980
You don't know me.
I know he
meant nothing

03:17.981 --> 03:20.365
to you, nothing,
and he was the only father...
What do you want me to say?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.234
(several shouting)
Stop!

03:22.236 --> 03:23.635
What do you need me
to tell you?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.571
What do you
want from me?!

03:25.573 --> 03:26.939
What do you need
to hear me say?

03:26.941 --> 03:30.209
GUARD:
Anton, calm down.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.348
And I'll be at your
next parole hearing

03:36.350 --> 03:38.250
and the next one.
Get him out
to the yard,

03:38.252 --> 03:38.951
cool him off.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.552
Until you're dead,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.704
do you understand me?

03:42.705 --> 03:44.855
I'll escort these
folks out of here.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.586
They're transferring Warshaw
to maximum lockdown tomorrow.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.721
I know.
We're going today.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.356
Today? You sure?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.658
We've got everything we need.
Crew's up to speed.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.792
Word's out already.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.628
Get it started.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.932
All right, boys,
put your cards down.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.034
Let's get this
started right now.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.003
Follow my lead.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.614
(indistinct shouting)

04:42.616 --> 04:43.548
(grunting)

04:43.550 --> 04:44.783
(yells)

04:54.461 --> 04:56.895
You two doing okay?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.563
We're fine, thank you.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.599
I don't buy that crap,
either.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.435
You know they got a book out
on how to write

05:03.437 --> 05:04.770
these boo-hoo statements
to the victims?

05:04.772 --> 05:07.539
(alarm blaring)
What's that?

05:08.575 --> 05:11.343
This is Potter.
What's the alarm?

05:11.345 --> 05:12.511
Follow me.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.479
What's going on?
Just follow me now.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.548
Come on. We got to go.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.719
(alarm continues blaring)

05:34.501 --> 05:37.869
(excited chattering in distance,
alarm continues blaring)

05:54.521 --> 05:56.521
(door opens,
bell over door rings)

05:57.791 --> 05:59.624
Give me your money!

05:59.626 --> 06:00.859
Give me the money!

06:03.731 --> 06:05.130
Get out of my store!

06:05.132 --> 06:06.431
(gunshot)

06:06.433 --> 06:07.632
(groans)

06:08.769 --> 06:11.903
(excited chattering)

06:11.905 --> 06:14.005
Open the door! Open the door!

06:14.007 --> 06:16.708
For God's sakes,
open the door!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.544
(indistinct shouting)

06:19.546 --> 06:20.812
Everybody knows

06:20.814 --> 06:21.980
what to do!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.782
Break into the box!
Gear up!

06:23.784 --> 06:25.650
Find me some phones!

06:28.088 --> 06:29.488
Carter!

06:29.490 --> 06:30.989
Carter!

06:30.991 --> 06:32.624
We got visitors hallway eight.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.659
Grab them.
They may come in handy.

06:34.661 --> 06:37.596
Anything you can!
Find me a phone!

06:48.442 --> 06:51.510
¶ ¶
(sirens blaring)

07:02.823 --> 07:05.824
Okay, we've got
multiple hostages

07:05.826 --> 07:08.527
and 75 to a hundred inmates
involved.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.696
We're looking for knives, shivs,
shanks, improvised maces.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.498
Everything is a weapon,

07:13.500 --> 07:16.568
so we're strictly less lethal:
gas, rubber bullets, Tasers.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.570
A prison riot,
and we're<i> less</i> lethal?
Yes.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.672
No firearms in the prison.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.773
You think it's bad now?
Throw a loaded gun into the mix.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.710
And us up against a hundred cons
with shanks and shivs isn't?
Come on,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.512
you ever get hit
by a rubber bullet?

07:27.514 --> 07:28.947
Take anybody down.
That's good
'cause it's not

07:28.949 --> 07:30.449
like we're running into a place

07:30.451 --> 07:32.851
with a dozen guys
we've put away or anything.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.925
All we know is, it appears
to have started in the yard.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.493
One inmate attacked another
unprovoked;

07:41.495 --> 07:45.163
the guards intervened;
and things escalated from there.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.967
We'll set up
command post here.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.969
Any casualties
reported so far?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.737
So far only the inmate
and a guard

07:52.739 --> 07:54.105
who was attacked in the yard,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.874
but I've got three guards
unaccounted for.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.042
They've blacked out
CCTV cameras,

07:57.044 --> 07:58.777
so we've got a lot
of blind spots.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.779
We've been trying
to lock down the wings,

08:00.781 --> 08:02.013
but they've disabled
the main control.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.149
So all the prisoners
are out of their cells.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.117
Except for the ones
in maximum lockdown.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.953
Okay, folks, priority here
is containment.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.921
Let's look at the floor plans.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.757
There's a guard station
on each wing.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.593
Can we do a manual lockdown
from those stations?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.727
Yeah, it's the only way.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.862
They've taken
the inner control room.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.063
It overrides us here.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.764
Taking over four
guard stations,

08:19.766 --> 08:21.199
letting everyone loose;
this is looking

08:21.201 --> 08:23.702
a little more planned
than spontaneous to me.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.804
Warden, how many guards
can you give us?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.022
We got 20 already inside.

08:27.023 --> 08:28.239
There's more coming in.
Okay, good.

08:28.242 --> 08:31.076
Sam, head up Alpha Team
with Jules and Spike.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.044
Leah, Wordy, you're
with me. Bravo.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.813
We clear and contain,

08:34.815 --> 08:36.548
wing by wing, A through D.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.583
Warden, we're gonna use
your guards as backup.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.218
Maximum caution.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.852
These gentlemen have
already lost their freedom.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.890
They won't win friends by being
cooperative with us here today.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.192
We're gonna need you
on comm, Warden.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.860
This your P.A.?
Mm-hmm.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.795
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker

08:50.797 --> 08:53.265
with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.966
PARKER:
Attention, all inmates.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.836
Tactical teams
and reinforcements to the guards

08:57.838 --> 08:59.838
are being deployed
throughout the facility.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.542
We have been instructed
to take all necessary steps

09:03.544 --> 09:05.243
to resolve this disturbance.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.812
If you return immediately
to your cells,

09:07.814 --> 09:10.115
there will be
no further repercussions.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.917
Sergeant, problem.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.519
Who are they, Warden?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.120
WARDEN:
There was
a parole hearing today.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.989
That looks like
the victim's family.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.325
They didn't make it
out in time.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.562
Okay, team, we've
got civilians inside,

09:23.564 --> 09:24.963
A Wing hallway.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.331
Sam, new priority.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.967
Alpha Team to A Wing;
civilians at risk.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.602
We're gonna stay
less lethal?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.237
Till you hear otherwise.
Let's go.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.043
All right, Warden,
you run the show here.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.211
Any idea what
triggered this thing?

09:40.213 --> 09:43.014
They've got good services here.
We're pretty progressive.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.983
We're not overcrowded.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.951
Yeah, but how about:
who might be behind it?
Well,

09:46.954 --> 09:49.321
I haven't any prison grievances
in the last two months.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.956
They take all
their grievances to you?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.091
No, of course not.
Then how about
telling me

09:53.093 --> 09:57.195
about some of the power players
you got in here.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.173
Multiple stab wounds.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.041
We have to move him.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.943
Boss, we got the injured inmate.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.978
Multiple
stab wounds

10:12.980 --> 10:14.880
to the chest.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.781
Any identifying marks
or tattoos?

10:16.783 --> 10:17.949
Picture coming your way.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.018
Boss, we got to get him
out of here fast.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.920
(man whistles)
I'm gonna send him
to the EMTs.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.189
Hey, you got to come here.
Stay where you are!
Do not move!

10:24.191 --> 10:25.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.157
Do not move!

10:26.159 --> 10:27.292
Okay, okay, okay.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.893
They got the guards.

10:28.895 --> 10:29.928
Where?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.263
They took three guards
to C Wing.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.099
Who took them?
I didn't see their faces.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.266
You sure about that?

10:35.268 --> 10:38.637
Look, I don't need
that kind of trouble.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.271
Boss, we may
have a location

10:40.273 --> 10:42.040
on the missing guards.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.811
I'm taking an alternate route
to get the Amiris out.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.781
(inmates clamoring in distance)

10:50.717 --> 10:52.317
Back off, Carter.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.152
Really want to do this, Frank?

11:03.196 --> 11:04.362
SLOAN:
<i> Where's Carter?</i>

11:04.364 --> 11:06.698
He's still running
down civilians.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.932
We don't have time.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.802
Come on, Carter.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.137
(woman screaming)

11:12.139 --> 11:14.205
No, no! Please!

11:14.207 --> 11:16.041
(screaming)

11:16.043 --> 11:17.942
Hey! Let me
get you going!

11:19.846 --> 11:21.379
WOMAN:
No!

11:21.381 --> 11:23.682
Back off.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.457
No one touches them.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.028
They're mine.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.901
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

12:16.737 --> 12:18.737
Boss, we've got
a second victim:

12:18.739 --> 12:20.322
male, 30 to 35,

12:20.323 --> 12:21.906
looks like he was thrown down
a flight of stairs.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.508
Thanks, Mike.
I'm uploading
a photo.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.110
Team, any sign of the civilians?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.111
Not yet,

12:26.113 --> 12:27.746
but we've got A Wing contained.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.047
Prisoners are in their cell.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.949
Manual override's
in the guard room, 300 feet

12:30.951 --> 12:32.784
to the north of you.
Lock it down

12:32.786 --> 12:33.818
and move out.
Copy that.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.019
What do we do with the body?

12:35.021 --> 12:36.788
We'll have to deal
with him later.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.990
The priority one
is to locate those civilians.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.228
Warden, help me see if there's
a bigger picture here.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.896
The first victim
from the yard attack,

12:44.898 --> 12:46.965
the, um, guy
with the bandana?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.399
He's Satan's Blood.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.301
He's an untouchable.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.036
Satan's Blood's
the top gang in this place.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.505
He's one of their captains.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.473
They pretty much control
all the drugs, everything.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.475
Yeah, well, riot's a good
time to settle scores.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.977
No, this was
a mistake though.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.562
Why's that?

13:00.563 --> 13:02.146
You hit the Blood,
they hit you twice as hard.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.850
That's why they stay on top.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.552
Boss, I need Alpha Team to run
down this lead on the guards.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.454
Eddie, we still have
two civilians out here.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.289
I hear you.
They could be anywhere.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.057
The guard's position we know.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.894
Get in there.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.128
(grunts)

13:17.130 --> 13:19.230
So this is you, the changed man?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.099
Shut it!
Animal!

13:21.101 --> 13:22.167
What'd you call me?

13:23.236 --> 13:24.335
You want to say that again?

13:24.337 --> 13:25.336
PARKER:
<i> Sam, I need you</i>

13:25.338 --> 13:27.238
to hook up with
Ed at C Wing.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.307
SAM:
Copy that.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.308
Hey, Winnie.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.309
WINNIE:
Yeah, boss?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.977
Tell Team Four to step on it.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.045
We're under the gun here.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.980
I'm on it.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.932
Warden.
Hmm?

13:37.933 --> 13:39.883
Can you ID the, uh, the victim
from the hallway?

13:39.886 --> 13:42.020
Yeah, that's Keenan Carter,
one of the NTLs.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.555
What's NTL?

13:43.557 --> 13:45.190
Nothing to Lose--
they're a collection of lifers.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.125
They've had a beef
with the Blood for years.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.359
Carter's the leader?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.261
No, their leader's name
is Sloan Keller.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.163
Sloan Keller--
that name's familiar.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.165
Can I see his file?
Mm-hmm.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.534
He's a hired killer,
in for life.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.536
The Panetta killings--
that Sloan Keller?

13:58.538 --> 14:01.005
The Benares killings,
the Mitchinson killings--

14:01.007 --> 14:04.108
<i> that Sloan Keller.</i>

14:05.178 --> 14:06.411
SLOAN:
You kill Carter?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.979
I didn't think
you had that in you.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.181
Did you know he was
one of my boys?!

14:10.183 --> 14:11.883
Your boy was about to kill them.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.184
I mean, that's not smart.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.119
I mean, two
civilians?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.120
This here's gold.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.188
We can get whatever we want.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.990
He's up for parole,
no crew, no rep.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.525
What, are we supposed
to trust you?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.360
Parole? I just
lost my shot.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.095
I got nothing else
to lose today.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.047
What are they to you?

14:26.048 --> 14:27.998
This one's the reason
I lost my shot.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.434
We finish this,

14:29.436 --> 14:32.303
I want to get mine.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.304
I can appreciate that.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.823
Carter was a good man.

14:34.824 --> 14:36.341
He was a good soldier.
He was a friend.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.009
I got a mind
to settle this!

14:38.011 --> 14:40.011
Hey, hey!
Keep your head in the game!

14:40.013 --> 14:41.079
Hey!

14:42.649 --> 14:45.083
Keeping them alive right now
was a smart play.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.185
When we're done here,
you want them?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.453
Yeah.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.555
Then you're gonna do it
exactly the way I say.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.891
Say, "Yes, boss!"

14:52.893 --> 14:54.392
Yes, boss.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.062
One: you're gonna
take the hostages,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.530
you're gonna put them
where I tell you to.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.166
And two: I need someone to talk
to the cops about our demands.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.368
It was gonna be Carter,

15:03.370 --> 15:05.103
but maybe it'll be
a little bit better

15:05.105 --> 15:06.971
if it was coming
from the warden's little buddy.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.640
What are we asking for?

15:08.642 --> 15:11.142
It doesn't matter.
You just keep them busy.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.012
We're breaking out of D Wing,
going through a wall.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.314
But no one's going anywhere
unless you buy us a little time.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.350
All right.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.652
But they're still mine.

15:20.654 --> 15:24.522
No one touches
Burrows' little pets.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.095
Boss, we've reached C Wing.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.830
Bravo Team, what's your 20?

15:32.831 --> 15:34.564
Bravo approaching
from east hall.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.302
PARKER:
Copy that.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.406
There's a common room
to your left.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.075
Might be where they're
holding the guards.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.152
WORDY (whispers):
Three guards,

15:54.154 --> 15:55.153
immediate left.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.289
They look hurt.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.424
Two inmates-- one on
the hostages, one to the right.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.391
Weapons?

16:00.393 --> 16:01.592
Looks like a knife,

16:01.594 --> 16:04.662
two guard batons,
a lot of bad attitude.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.498
Barricades?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.267
Access is clear.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.339
ED:
Okay, Leah,

16:14.341 --> 16:15.440
cover the door.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.741
Spike and Jules,
take the guards.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.443
Sam, Wordy and I
will take the inmates.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.345
On three.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.715
One, two, three.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.683
Hands in the air!
SRU!

16:25.685 --> 16:27.285
Police! Drop your weapons!

16:27.287 --> 16:29.020
Everybody down!
Drop your weapons!

16:29.022 --> 16:30.121
Show me your hands!

16:30.123 --> 16:33.191
Drop your weapon!

16:37.630 --> 16:39.263
Hostages secured.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.198
Heading to Command.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.183
PARKER:
Okay.

16:42.184 --> 16:44.167
Got guards on the way
to deal with the inmates.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.336
Thank you.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.404
You good?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.211
Nice work, Eddie.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.013
Sergeant Parker,
got something.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.180
This is Anton Burrows.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.182
We have a list of demands.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.217
Send us someone out here

16:59.219 --> 17:00.618
who can make some decisions.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.253
I know him.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.340
Boss, I know him.

17:05.341 --> 17:07.458
Back in the day, when I was in
41 Division patrolling gangland.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.028
Who'd he run with?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.095
Wasn't a gangbanger.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.296
He was more like a hang-around.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.032
There's something
you should know.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.167
Anton Burrows was up for parole
this morning.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.568
And?
He was denied

17:17.570 --> 17:18.803
for the fourth time.

17:18.805 --> 17:19.804
Four times-- why?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.339
Because every time,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.508
the victim's family--
the Amiris-- they attend.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.411
And they make sure
he doesn't get out.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.180
So you're telling me they are
the civilian hostages in there.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.214
Yeah.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.550
Okay, boss,
I can do this.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.584
You sure?

17:33.586 --> 17:35.219
I know him. Let me do it.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.822
Okay, go.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.269
Sam, I got to
do this alone.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.851
Been a long time, Anton.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.854
Yeah, long time.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.323
Not the place I was
hoping to find you.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.625
You knew I was in here.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.428
I mean, right now,
standing there...

18:17.430 --> 18:18.830
running this whole mess.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.332
Got to do what I got to do.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.301
Hostages safe?

18:23.303 --> 18:24.335
They're safe.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.306
Anton, I trusted your word once.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.309
They're safe.
I swear to you.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.512
ED:
I hope so.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.682
Anton, I know
who they are.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.427
We demand the following.

18:50.530 --> 18:55.266
One: increase to two the number
of conjugal visits per month.

18:55.268 --> 18:59.904
Two: larger number of spaces
available for work detail.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.141
Three: creation of
a prisoners' advocacy board

19:03.143 --> 19:05.176
to address inmate concerns.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.511
All this for conjugal visits?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.614
There's got to be
something more going on.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.615
That's it?

19:10.617 --> 19:11.916
For now.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.285
But this thing's not over
until we say it is.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.304
Don't forget that.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.322
Anton, if anything happens
to those hostages...

19:18.324 --> 19:19.323
Only way something happens

19:19.325 --> 19:20.591
to those hostages

19:20.593 --> 19:23.327
is if you come in here
looking for them.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.795
Now, get us what we want.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.230
You don't have much time.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.299
Remember
the Ridgestone Towers

19:28.301 --> 19:30.168
back in the days?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.236
That's exactly what
you're looking at here

19:32.238 --> 19:34.672
unless we get some satisfaction.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.907
You understand?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.309
Do you understand me?
I understand.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.278
I understand.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.913
I'll start working
on the demands.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.685
Not adding up, Eddie.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.887
Boss, we need to regroup,
set up for immediate action.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.622
Eddie, we just agreed
to negotiate.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.658
No time, not if we're gonna
stop a breakout.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.808
Where ae
you taking u?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.877
Where the boss
wants us to go.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.380
MAN:
Hey.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.216
(whistling)

20:18.218 --> 20:19.383
(whooping, laughter)

20:19.385 --> 20:22.486
Here we go, guys.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.555
Move.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.527
Come on.
(kissing noises, whistles)

20:32.232 --> 20:35.366
ED:
The guy right there.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.801
He was trying hard
to look like Anton's sidekick.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.336
Okay, it's the other way around.
Warden?

20:38.338 --> 20:39.837
WARDEN:
If Sloan Keller's
behind the riot,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.406
then this isn't just about
a list of minor grievances.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.408
Well, does a breakout
make sense?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.710
Sloan thinks big.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.511
Eddie, what's making you
feel so sure?

20:47.513 --> 20:48.879
He brought up the
Ridgestone Towers.
And?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.615
And it was a big gang bust.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.416
Boss, it was the West End Crew.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.352
We-we had them holed up
in a standoff.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.887
When we finally went in,
they were gone.

20:56.889 --> 21:00.424
They'd cut through the walls
in all the other apartments.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.393
So Sloan wants to break out,
but first he triggers a riot

21:02.395 --> 21:04.462
so that the place is surrounded
by cops? Smart.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.696
The fact that they're here

21:05.698 --> 21:06.964
kind of suggests
they're not master criminals.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.366
PARKER:
Well, maybe he didn't
trigger the riot.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.900
Maybe he's just
capitalizing on it.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.969
Nah, feels like
it was part of the plan.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.337
You sure Anton's not
playing you?

21:13.339 --> 21:15.306
I know how it sounds.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.508
I got a feeling
he's on the level.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.010
JULES:
Where do you figure

21:19.012 --> 21:21.579
they're staging this?
Well, A and C is locked down.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.814
So it's gonna be B or D.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.449
D has the most exposed wall
leading to the outside.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.752
I've got Team Four
positioned along the perimeter,

21:27.754 --> 21:29.287
so no one's going anywhere.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.421
All right, what kind of eyes

21:30.423 --> 21:31.989
we got in there?
Couple cameras is all.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.357
They've knocked the others out.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.026
All right,
let's take a look at D Wing.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.927
Entrances?
There's a hallway
runs to it from here.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.496
Comes out right
in the back

21:38.498 --> 21:39.597
of D Wing.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.633
So we got the element
of surprise.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.934
Wordy, Spike,
you're with me.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.337
Sam?
We'll grill for intel.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.438
Yeah, we're gonna start
with the inmates.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.873
Let's go.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.408
Eddie.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.542
Hold on one second.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.682
I took a look at Anton's file.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.718
It says that Anton's lawyer
contacted you at his sentencing

22:00.720 --> 22:02.753
as a character witness.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.888
Anything I need to know?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.523
You checking up on me or...?

22:07.460 --> 22:08.726
Just doing a background.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.561
We grew up
in the same neighborhood.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.063
Malvern, right?

22:12.065 --> 22:13.064
Yeah.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.637
Tough crowd.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.471
My folks and his folks
were friends.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.407
He was a little bit
younger than me.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.777
And when his dad died, he got
mixed up with the wrong crowd.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.880
My old man asked me
to look out for him.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.615
He was a good kid
going off the rails.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.535
He was a good kid.

22:34.536 --> 22:37.454
He was a great kid.
He had a big heart.

22:37.457 --> 22:41.492
I was a rookie uniform
trying to save the world,

22:41.494 --> 22:43.894
so I went to his mother
and I went to his teachers,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.697
and I said, "I'll look out
for him. I'll look out for him."

22:48.668 --> 22:51.602
And then one night,

22:51.604 --> 22:56.040
then one night I get a call from
a buddy of mine in Homicide.

22:56.042 --> 23:00.811
There was a shooting
down at Kingston Road.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.546
Convenience store.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.814
That's not your fault.
It doesn't matter.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.483
It doesn't matter.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.851
I thought he could beat
the odds.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.820
Eddie... Eddie,

23:09.822 --> 23:13.023
do you believe
what Anton's telling you now?

23:13.025 --> 23:15.559
I don't know if he's telling
the truth or not,

23:15.561 --> 23:17.495
but I do know

23:17.497 --> 23:21.465
that he could have killed those
hostages by now if he wanted to.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.440
When they meet those demands,
I mean,

23:29.442 --> 23:30.541
what are we
gonna do then?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.076
Well, we'll make
more demands and more

23:32.078 --> 23:33.110
until our work here
is done.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.178
I thought we were busting out.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.413
Who asked you to think?

23:35.415 --> 23:36.447
Get back to your pets.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.515
There's no breakout?

23:37.517 --> 23:39.683
Sure there is.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.118
For anyone who wants to run

23:41.120 --> 23:43.687
straight into the arms
of a SWAT team.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.755
Bomb's good to go.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.590
How we doing with the Bloods?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.626
We've taken care
of all four captains.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.127
Warshaw's the last one.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.897
SLOAN:
Good.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.929
¶ ¶

24:54.160 --> 24:56.060
(men scream)

24:56.062 --> 24:57.628
Let's go! Right
there! Right there!

24:57.630 --> 24:59.597
Up against the wall!
(officers shouting)

24:59.599 --> 25:00.965
Hands on the wall!

25:00.967 --> 25:01.966
Up against the wall!

25:01.968 --> 25:03.734
Do not move!

25:03.736 --> 25:04.768
Don't move!
Don't move!

25:04.770 --> 25:06.670
All right, let's go.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.272
Get them out of here.

25:08.274 --> 25:12.009
Get them out of here,
out of here now.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.616
This doesn't make any sense.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.617
Why?

25:19.619 --> 25:21.285
The bomb-- it's good to go.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.686
It's set up really smart.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.755
It's a solid piece of work,
but it's lame.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.624
What do you mean?
I mean it's just propane.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.192
The kind of explosion
you're going to get from this--

25:28.194 --> 25:29.994
you'll get a big flash,
a big boom,

25:29.996 --> 25:31.662
but a flash isn't going
to take out a wall.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.763
You need something
with actual force,

25:32.765 --> 25:34.899
and this just
doesn't have any.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.034
Spike, those guys looked
like they were good to go.
Well, everything about this

25:37.036 --> 25:40.671
looks good to go,
but to go nowhere unless...

25:40.673 --> 25:43.807
Unless the big boom
was the whole point.

25:43.809 --> 25:44.975
A distraction?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.885
Eddie, we've got a situation
in the commissary.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.020
Alpha is on their way.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.288
You'd better move fast.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.623
Bomb is defused, boss.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.858
We're on our way.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.800
What happens now?

26:09.802 --> 26:10.901
You've made
your demands.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.169
Now what?

26:12.171 --> 26:14.338
I don't know.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.074
I'm sorry.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.842
(whispers in Persian)

26:18.844 --> 26:20.578
My daughter--

26:20.580 --> 26:22.580
what she said
about you today--

26:22.582 --> 26:24.748
you have to
understand.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.153
I know.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.187
You know what?

26:30.189 --> 26:31.322
(both whispering
in Persian)

26:34.727 --> 26:38.629
You don't want to hurt us,
do you?

26:38.631 --> 26:40.064
Why did you have to come here?

26:40.066 --> 26:41.131
Because
you killed

26:41.133 --> 26:43.968
my father,
left him to die alone.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.235
You belong here.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.672
If I belonged here,
you'd already be dead.

26:49.642 --> 26:52.109
Why did you kill
my husband?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.645
We know why: for money, for...

26:54.647 --> 26:55.846
Tell me.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.316
Tell me.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.820
Not what you tell them
to get out.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.688
The truth.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.826
Why?

27:08.828 --> 27:12.162
The place I grew up...

27:12.164 --> 27:17.034
either you get with a gang
or the gang gets you.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.902
My ma,

27:18.904 --> 27:23.340
this... this cop--

27:23.342 --> 27:27.311
they tried to keep me out.

27:27.313 --> 27:31.849
I tried, too...

27:31.851 --> 27:35.819
but I just got tired...

27:35.821 --> 27:39.757
of trying...

27:39.759 --> 27:41.925
of being scared all the time.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.998
So these guys said to me,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.933
"You want to get with something,
something good,

27:49.935 --> 27:53.337
"something strong?

27:53.339 --> 27:57.675
"Get with us.

27:57.677 --> 28:01.412
"See that corner store
over on Kingston Road?

28:01.414 --> 28:03.681
"You got to rob it.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.184
The guy there--
he's used to it."

28:08.120 --> 28:10.254
(door opening, bell jingling)

28:10.256 --> 28:11.722
Give me the money.

28:11.724 --> 28:12.723
Give me the money!

28:12.725 --> 28:13.791
<i> It was just a way in.</i>

28:15.761 --> 28:18.362
To show they could trust me.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.734
<i> I wanted that so bad.</i>

28:26.472 --> 28:29.206
Just to be with something.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.477
So I went in.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.414
I had the gun they gave me.

28:37.416 --> 28:41.485
I mean, that store had been hit
ten, 12 times already that year.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.720
Give me the money!

28:44.457 --> 28:46.790
Get out of my store!

28:46.792 --> 28:47.925
(gunshot)

28:47.927 --> 28:49.093
(groans)

28:52.264 --> 28:56.500
All I wanted... was the money.

29:00.272 --> 29:03.474
But I guess he was just...

29:03.476 --> 29:08.178
sick of being robbed,
of being afraid all the time.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.249
But...

29:13.185 --> 29:15.519
I did it.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.191
I shot and killed him.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.829
Because I was afraid.

29:26.799 --> 29:30.801
That's the only "why"
I can think of.

29:30.803 --> 29:34.538
I-I killed your father

29:34.540 --> 29:37.808
and there's, and there's nothing
I can do to take it back.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.915
<i> But he didn't die alone.</i>

29:44.917 --> 29:47.518
Please don't die.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.890
(sobbing)

30:00.099 --> 30:04.468
ED:
Boss, we got three more victims,
all prisoners.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.506
This was never about a breakout.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.575
They all have the same tattoo.
Yeah, these victims

30:11.577 --> 30:13.143
are all Satan's Blood--
leaders, enforcers.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.578
PARKER:
The ones you want to hit

30:14.580 --> 30:16.146
when you're attempting
a takeover.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.348
So he triggered a riot
to keep the guards busy.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.417
Take advantage of the chaos
to get to his enemies.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.921
Tries to distract us with
bogus bombs and bogus demands.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.473
Makes sense--
king of the empire.

30:25.474 --> 30:27.024
It's a whole lot more power
than Sloan would have

30:27.026 --> 30:28.859
in the outside world.
And it's a day

30:28.861 --> 30:30.327
on the inside
no one will forget.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.428
Warden, how
many other

30:31.430 --> 30:32.763
Satan's Blood untouchables?

30:32.764 --> 30:34.097
WARDEN:
After those guys,
just the top man--

30:34.099 --> 30:35.566
Terry Warshaw.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.835
We got him in custody?
No, he's in B Wing.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.986
All right, we're on the move.

30:38.987 --> 30:40.136
Boss, upload us a photo
on the fly.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.840
PARKER:
Copy.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.275
(typing)

30:45.277 --> 30:46.944
That's your man.

30:46.946 --> 30:47.945
Boss, we split up

30:47.947 --> 30:49.580
into Alpha and Bravo.

30:49.582 --> 30:51.315
We need to get
those hostages secure

30:51.317 --> 30:53.851
before they get
a hold of Warshaw.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.886
Bravo Team,
what's your ETA on B Ward?

30:55.888 --> 30:58.222
Minutes, boss.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.290
You got seconds; we got
to get to him before they do.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.558
He's the grand prize.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.559
With Warshaw gone,

31:02.561 --> 31:03.594
<i> Sloan's got what he wants.</i>

31:03.596 --> 31:05.863
<i> When he's got what he wants,</i>

31:05.864 --> 31:08.131
<i> he's got no reason</i>
<i> to let the hostages live.</i>

31:10.069 --> 31:13.036
MAN:
We got you, dead man.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.441
You're dead meat,
Warshaw.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.410
Make a move, man.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.619
(footsteps approaching)

31:28.621 --> 31:30.888
SLOAN:
What the hell did you say
to that cop, Burrows?

31:30.890 --> 31:32.256
You were there. You heard me.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.924
What I heard now was

31:33.925 --> 31:35.591
the sound of a bomb
not going off.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.994
Cops must have got
to it before.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.128
Means they found out.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.162
Means we have a rat.

31:39.164 --> 31:40.163
Yeah, well, let's
go find him.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.298
Oh, I think
we already have.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.499
Oh, yeah, it
couldn't be

31:42.501 --> 31:44.534
the 20 other goofs
you got working for you.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.570
But if that's what you feel,
make your move.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.571
This won't take
but a minute.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.972
Oh, come on!
Hey, Sloan,

31:48.974 --> 31:50.941
I'm telling you I...
In a few moments,

31:50.943 --> 31:54.244
it's either going to be all good
or it's not.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.980
Then I'll hear
what you have to say.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.415
PARKER:
<i> So the bomb wasn't</i>

31:58.417 --> 31:59.950
about a breakout.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.919
It was saved
as their biggest distraction

32:01.921 --> 32:04.121
for their biggest target:
Warshaw.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.689
ED:
Boss, it looks
like Anton played me...

32:05.691 --> 32:08.592
again.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.528
Freeze!
SRU!

32:11.530 --> 32:13.664
Drop the weapon!
(overlapping yelling, gunshot)

32:13.666 --> 32:15.165
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon now!

32:15.167 --> 32:16.400
Hands in the air!
Get down!

32:16.402 --> 32:18.068
Right now!
(gunshot)
Get on your knees!

32:19.271 --> 32:21.338
Hands on your head!

32:21.340 --> 32:24.241
Rubber bullets
take down anyone, huh?

32:24.243 --> 32:26.944
Yeah, so I thought.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.319
CLEAN:
No, you stay there.
You keep me posted.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.722
Well, word's out.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.124
Cops got 'em before
they could finish Warshaw.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.159
He's in protective custody now.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.226
That's it.

32:47.499 --> 32:51.234
So... things didn't go
all our way today.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.569
Close.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.538
So my question is:

32:54.540 --> 32:56.473
which side are you
going to be on?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.508
Same as always, man:

32:58.510 --> 33:00.177
My own.
No.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.678
You're gonna need protection,

33:01.680 --> 33:03.380
especially now that
Satan's Blood knows

33:03.382 --> 33:05.682
how close you and me are, so...

33:05.684 --> 33:08.719
you are gonna show me
that you're still a guy
that I can trust.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.687
Yeah, man, I told you,
when the time's right

33:10.689 --> 33:12.689
I'll take 'em out.
Time's right now!

33:12.691 --> 33:14.658
They're gonna die anyway.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.760
Might as well be by you.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.768
Wordy?

33:32.244 --> 33:34.244
(beep)

33:34.246 --> 33:35.746
Yeah.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.381
Two seated.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.715
Not moving, small.
It's got to be them.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.551
Boss, we've located
the hostages.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.753
That door is pretty heavy.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.738
If there are obstacles...

33:44.739 --> 33:46.722
Yeah, the hostages will be dead
before we get the door open.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.725
There's got to be another way.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.027
Doesn't look like it, Eddie.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.462
Warden, what is this room?

33:52.464 --> 33:53.764
That's an old weight room.

33:53.766 --> 33:56.299
But it's been closed
over a year for renos.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.368
It's the only part of the prison
that's just brick.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.437
Posed an escape risk, even
though it's four stories up.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.539
Well, if they can break out,
we can break in.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.408
Hey, Spike, how do you feel
about explosive entry?

34:04.410 --> 34:07.044
She is gonna keep you in here
as long as she lives.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.613
You do this now. Finish it.
No one knows it's you.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.782
She doesn't shows up
to your parole board hearing.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.817
It's your only shot
to get out.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.786
No.

34:15.788 --> 34:18.221
Let me put it another way:

34:18.223 --> 34:21.391
You kill her, or I kill you.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.460
Your choice.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.800
(panting)

34:29.802 --> 34:31.168
You called me an animal.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.303
Why are you thinking about this?

34:36.742 --> 34:39.342
But I'm not.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.645
(phone rings)

34:41.647 --> 34:43.080
Cops are on the move.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.247
They're coming in.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.382
(knife clatters on floor)

34:45.384 --> 34:46.750
Sloan, let 'em live.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.351
I'll say whatever you want;
I'll take the heat

34:48.353 --> 34:49.820
for this whole thing.
Just let them live...

34:49.822 --> 34:52.589
I told the cops, they come in,

34:52.591 --> 34:55.692
the hostages die.

34:55.694 --> 34:56.493
No!

34:56.495 --> 34:57.794
(screaming)

34:57.796 --> 34:59.763
Let me go.
Let me go.

34:59.765 --> 35:00.797
Kill him!

35:00.799 --> 35:02.199
No! No! Get off me!

35:02.201 --> 35:03.733
Yes.
No, get...

35:03.735 --> 35:05.368
Yes.
Get off me.
Get off me.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.538
Let me go.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.773
(mumbling)

35:09.775 --> 35:11.141
Now, get out!

35:11.143 --> 35:12.209
He's mine.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.577
(Anton crying)

35:13.579 --> 35:16.446
Oh, I've been waiting
for this all day.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.280
Yeah.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.583
(grunting)

35:27.326 --> 35:29.392
(panting)

35:37.569 --> 35:39.870
(touch tones beeping)

35:39.872 --> 35:41.238
(phone ringing)

35:41.240 --> 35:42.806
Warden.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.142
It's 911.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.144
They've got Anton on the phone.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.913
It's Parker.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.214
It-It... It's Anton.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.416
Listen to me.
You got to get in here.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.684
They're gonna kill the hostages.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.852
Anton, it's okay.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.821
We're working on it.
Just sit tight.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.189
No. You don't have any time.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.390
You got to get in here now.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.491
Okay, we're already
at the door.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.592
No.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.710
They're expecting that.

36:03.711 --> 36:04.827
All right,
just stay on the line.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.530
Eddie, I got Anton.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.398
I'm gonna patch
him through.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.566
ED:
Go ahead.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.867
You can't go through the door.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.552
They're expecting it.

36:12.553 --> 36:14.236
Anton, you told me
there was gonna be a breakout.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.405
Why should I trust you now?

36:15.407 --> 36:17.274
I was told
there was gonna be a breakout.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.209
That's what I was told.

36:19.211 --> 36:21.278
I'm just trying
to keep them alive, that's it.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.579
If I can just...

36:22.581 --> 36:24.948
You don't believe
anyone can change, do you?

36:24.950 --> 36:26.283
Seeing is believing, Anton.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.517
Yeah.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.853
Well, if you don't
get in here soon,

36:29.855 --> 36:31.555
you're not gonna like
what you see.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.859
ED:
All right.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.761
Get everybody away
from that west wall,

36:37.763 --> 36:40.297
try to buy us
as much time as possible.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.932
Can you do that for me, Anton?

36:41.934 --> 36:43.967
I'm gonna try.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.670
No! No!

36:56.281 --> 36:57.614
PARKER:
<i> Yeah, I need</i>

36:57.616 --> 36:59.316
everyone's status now!

36:59.318 --> 37:00.483
Waiting on Spike.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.919
Need more time.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.223
It's up to you, Anton.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.358
No! No!

37:08.360 --> 37:09.526
No!

37:09.528 --> 37:11.328
(grunts)

37:11.330 --> 37:14.331
(screaming)

37:14.333 --> 37:16.533
No! No! No!

37:16.535 --> 37:17.634
(screaming)

37:17.636 --> 37:19.469
(crying)
No.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.537
No.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.506
(grunting)

37:23.508 --> 37:25.008
(indistinct chatter)

37:25.010 --> 37:26.476
Ah. Get up!

37:27.446 --> 37:29.346
Charge is in.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.652
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

37:35.654 --> 37:38.288
(groans)

37:40.592 --> 37:42.692
Hands on you.
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.994
Right now!
Right now!

37:43.996 --> 37:46.463
Everybody on the
floor! Get down!

37:46.465 --> 37:47.831
Get down now!
Stay where you are!

37:47.833 --> 37:48.865
Down. Down. Get down.
You stay down.

37:48.866 --> 37:49.898
Stay where you are.
Drop your weapon.

37:49.901 --> 37:50.900
Turn around.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.336
It's all right, okay?

37:53.338 --> 37:55.272
It's gonna be all right. All
right, come with me. Come on.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.607
Come on.
Let's go. Move.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.842
Come on, this way.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.443
It's okay.
You're safe now.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.478
Against the wall!

38:01.480 --> 38:04.514
(panting)

38:04.516 --> 38:05.849
They okay?

38:05.851 --> 38:07.317
They're safe.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.451
You did good.
(laughs)

38:08.453 --> 38:10.320
I'm keeping it true.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.522
You're going to be okay.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.357
You did good. I'm proud of you.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.925
You all right?

38:15.927 --> 38:17.727
Can you do something for me?

38:17.729 --> 38:19.329
Anything you need.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.866
Anything you need, buddy.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.371
PARKER:
<i> Nice job.</i>

38:28.373 --> 38:30.440
Team job.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.642
He survives 15 years
in this place,

38:32.644 --> 38:35.478
he still manages to
hang on to his soul.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.480
Yeah. Something
to be said for that.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.616
And when you figure out
what that is,

38:39.618 --> 38:41.451
I'm sure you'll say it.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.054
Excuse me.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.856
How you doing?
Is your mom okay?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.858
She will be.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.960
Can you get a message to Anton

38:50.962 --> 38:52.362
for me?

38:52.364 --> 38:55.098
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure we can do that.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.068
Tell him...
at his next parole hearing,

38:58.070 --> 38:59.602
I'll be there.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.939
I'll speak for him.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.608
Do you think people can change?

39:05.610 --> 39:09.946
I think some people
always had it in them.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.751
Anton wanted me
to give you something.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.757
¶ It's not a game ¶

39:20.759 --> 39:24.361
¶ I take lightly
for nothing is gained ¶

39:24.363 --> 39:29.065

39:39.911 --> 39:45.081
¶ So fast

39:45.083 --> 39:47.751
¶ Can't double back
on the truth ¶

39:50.422 --> 39:52.555
¶ It's not a game ¶

39:52.557 --> 39:56.726
