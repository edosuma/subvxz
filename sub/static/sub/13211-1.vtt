01:19.000 --> 01:21.625
Mr Winch. Good evening.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.416
What do you want?

01:26.374 --> 01:29.500
Don't worry, I'm not after your money anymore.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.708
I've met someone who has offered me much more...

01:31.958 --> 01:33.583
What do you want?

01:34.458 --> 01:35.792
To say goodbye.

01:36.541 --> 01:38.249
Goodbye for good, in fact.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.791
Exactly,

01:40.708 --> 01:43.749
- go to hell! - After you, Nerio...

02:26.164 --> 02:27.998
Good evening, Mr Winch!

04:46.201 --> 04:47.201
This is him.

04:51.326 --> 04:55.867
Largo!

04:59.117 --> 05:05.825
What are you doing, son?

05:06.076 --> 05:07.575
And him?

05:46.908 --> 05:49.699
Josip!

05:52.783 --> 05:54.407
What are you doing here?

05:54.865 --> 05:55.865
You're not happy to see me?

05:57.115 --> 05:58.740
- Hello, Freddy. - Hello

05:58.990 --> 06:01.366
Why didn't you say you were coming?

06:04.074 --> 06:05.615
I've always liked surprises.

06:07.115 --> 06:08.698
I'd like you to do something for me.

06:11.198 --> 06:12.365
Something important.

06:17.657 --> 06:24.490
(Mato Grosso State Brazil)

06:47.113 --> 06:48.489
When did you arrive?

06:49.322 --> 06:50.280
Today.

06:51.364 --> 06:52.696
When are you leaving again?

06:53.905 --> 06:55.030
Tomorrow.

06:56.531 --> 06:57.780
Where are you going?

06:58.530 --> 06:59.947
I'm heading up the river.

07:00.322 --> 07:01.446
How far up?

07:05.363 --> 07:07.072
It's a long river...

07:08.030 --> 07:09.696
I have plenty of time.

07:14.321 --> 07:15.613
What's your name?

07:16.696 --> 07:17.946
Largo.

07:19.196 --> 07:20.696
Largo what?

07:22.488 --> 07:23.987
Largo.

07:31.821 --> 07:33.570
I don't do my invincibility tattoo

07:33.821 --> 07:35.570
for just anyone.

07:36.570 --> 07:40.821
The last man I did it for got shot at
as soon as he stepped out of here.

07:41.737 --> 07:43.404
Some business over a girl...

07:45.404 --> 07:47.654
He stopped the bullet with his teeth!

07:49.320 --> 07:51.736
I have another one who stepped on a land-mine.

07:52.861 --> 07:54.653
Not a scratch on him...

07:56.195 --> 07:59.569
Just an eye to do and you'll be invincible...

08:04.528 --> 08:06.236
Let go of me!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.361
Hey! I haven't finished!

08:08.945 --> 08:11.569
Let go of me!

08:12.486 --> 08:13.528
Let go!

08:13.819 --> 08:15.528
Give her a kiss!

08:15.777 --> 08:18.111
She's a tough one.

08:19.611 --> 08:21.319
Let go, you fat pig!

08:21.568 --> 08:22.735
Let go of me!

08:22.985 --> 08:25.319
- Let go! - Hi.

08:25.819 --> 08:28.402
Don't take it personally
but I don't think you're her type.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.776
Invincible...

08:48.110 --> 08:49.276
There's an eye missing!

08:53.318 --> 08:54.442
Hey, fat pig!

09:18.150 --> 09:19.608
I could've managed alone.

09:22.984 --> 09:24.317
You want to manage alone?

09:31.566 --> 09:33.942
- You know these guys? - A private militia.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.525
They must know I work for an NGO. They hate us.

09:52.899 --> 09:54.899
Back up!

10:17.648 --> 10:18.690
Is it fine here?

10:19.439 --> 10:20.690
Perfect.

10:23.314 --> 10:25.148
I couldn't have managed alone.

10:28.273 --> 10:29.439
Largo.

10:31.856 --> 10:33.273
Lea.

11:19.563 --> 11:20.896
I really like it.

11:22.604 --> 11:24.396
What?

11:27.145 --> 11:28.604
Your name.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.145
I really like your name.

11:35.812 --> 11:38.312
The militia are paid by multinationals.

11:39.396 --> 11:41.437
They watch over the workers,

11:41.854 --> 11:44.145
poor guys, dragged from their villages.

11:44.562 --> 11:46.311
They're treated like slaves.

11:48.395 --> 11:49.395
And the police?

11:51.603 --> 11:52.979
They're all corrupt.

11:54.395 --> 11:55.812
To the very core.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.936
Well,

12:01.436 --> 12:07.353
as my communist granddad always said,
money buys everything.

12:15.811 --> 12:18.061
And what are you doing in this backwater?

12:22.644 --> 12:23.853
Wandering around.

12:26.352 --> 12:27.727
Where are you from?

12:30.477 --> 12:32.935
Where are you from with that odd name?

12:35.977 --> 12:37.477
It's a long story.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.976
This is Alexandre Meyer!
I must speak with him immediatly...

12:59.226 --> 13:00.809
Do you know what time it is?

13:01.059 --> 13:02.934
Yes, I know what time it is! It's urgent!

13:03.351 --> 13:04.435
Mister Kosrsky...

13:05.517 --> 13:06.475
What's wrong?

13:06.725 --> 13:08.851
Nerio Winch died last night...

13:09.892 --> 13:13.059
I think they're waiting for Tokyo
to close before announcing it.

13:14.143 --> 13:16.726
In that case there is no time to lose.

14:17.515 --> 14:20.931
You've travelled a lot, Mr Winczlav.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.098
Where's this from?

14:26.348 --> 14:27.639
It's not mine...

14:27.973 --> 14:29.432
It's not yours.

14:31.432 --> 14:33.889
Fifty years in prison! Fifty!

14:47.139 --> 14:50.639
The W Group remains the largest conglomerate
of multinational companies

14:50.847 --> 14:52.722
...ever held by one man.

14:53.097 --> 14:57.805
Originally from the Balkans, Nerio Winch
was the perfect image of the self-made man.

14:58.055 --> 15:00.763
The businessman with
Swiss, American dual nationality

15:01.014 --> 15:04.722
had recently established the headquarters
of his group in Hong Kong,

15:05.014 --> 15:08.805
convinced that China
was capitalism's new Promised Land.

15:09.055 --> 15:13.805
The preliminary clinical exams indicate
that Mr Winch had a dizzy spell

15:14.054 --> 15:16.597
and fell into the water as a result of it...

15:16.971 --> 15:21.430
... The announcement of Nerio Winch's death
has thrown stock markets into confusion.

15:21.679 --> 15:25.887
A delicate situation for Ann Ferguson
who has been Nerio Winch's right-hand

15:26.138 --> 15:27.263
for several years now...

15:27.846 --> 15:31.512
... As number two in the group, I shall
of course be acting temporarily as manager.

15:31.762 --> 15:33.804
There will be a general meeting
of the shareholders next Monday

15:34.054 --> 15:35.804
to designate a new chairman.

15:38.429 --> 15:42.345
Mr Winch's passing is an immeasurable
loss for the 392,000 employees.

15:42.554 --> 15:43.596
Use the underground car park.

15:43.846 --> 15:44.596
Nevertheless, I can guarantee that

15:44.596 --> 15:49.637
this group that he founded
and that bears his name shall live on.

15:50.387 --> 15:51.970
I shall fight for that myself.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.636
This is war!

15:55.886 --> 15:58.553
There you go, exaggerating as usual.

15:58.928 --> 16:00.928
IMX, does anyone know that name?

16:02.095 --> 16:03.095
For the last three weeks,

16:03.344 --> 16:06.887
that investment fund has discreetly
been buying up shares in the Group.

16:07.303 --> 16:09.761
Two hours before
the announcement of Nerio's death,

16:10.011 --> 16:12.469
they'd snapped up everything
available on the markets.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.802
It can't just be a coincidence.

16:15.386 --> 16:16.428
Who's behind it?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.927
The IMX head office is in the Cayman Islands...

16:19.136 --> 16:20.219
The perfect front...

16:20.469 --> 16:23.552
Buying up shares in the group,
whatever for? It's a waste of time.

16:24.261 --> 16:28.677
Everyone knows that
Nerio has a majority 65%. share in the group.

16:28.927 --> 16:31.594
Had. Do I need to remind you he's dead?

16:31.927 --> 16:35.719
We're defenceless. If we don't come up
with a riposte by the end of the day,

16:35.969 --> 16:37.844
the group is heading for disaster.

16:38.218 --> 16:40.302
What does the temporary manager think?

16:42.677 --> 16:45.177
Hum, my dear William,

16:45.718 --> 16:49.093
I think that Nerio had come up
with an excellent riposte.

16:50.926 --> 16:51.843
A son.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.467
Nerio never had children!

16:54.801 --> 16:56.177
An adopted son.

17:03.010 --> 17:05.384
Run, Largo! Run!

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
Largo!

17:09.718 --> 17:10.675
Largo!

17:10.925 --> 17:11.967
Goran!

17:12.217 --> 17:13.342
Stop it, Dad!

17:13.593 --> 17:14.884
Goran, open the door!

17:16.800 --> 17:18.259
Where's Largo vanished to?

17:35.258 --> 17:37.633
This old dog knows all the tricks.

17:44.799 --> 17:45.924
I don't know him.

17:46.591 --> 17:48.799
Hannah and I never lied to you.

17:49.049 --> 17:52.883
We just wanted this to happen later.
As late as possible.

17:53.924 --> 17:55.175
You don't love me.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.257
Never say that again!

17:58.008 --> 18:01.048
We've raised you as our own son.

18:01.299 --> 18:06.382
As long as there's breath in this body,
you can count on me.

18:25.007 --> 18:28.882
Largo, your real father is him.

18:48.173 --> 18:49.505
Hello, Largo.

19:22.546 --> 19:26.296
You understand why I wanted you
to grow up here far from the city.

19:27.129 --> 19:30.129
I'm the one who introduced Hannah to Josip.

19:30.379 --> 19:32.296
He came to see me in Switzerland.

19:32.837 --> 19:35.504
She was a waitress in the bar downstairs.

19:36.212 --> 19:37.588
I know all that.

19:38.546 --> 19:39.879
You know all that...

19:40.962 --> 19:43.879
It's time to prepare for the role that awaits you.

19:45.503 --> 19:46.628
What role?

19:48.212 --> 19:50.378
Later, my boy, later...

19:51.628 --> 19:53.046
What if I refuse?

19:54.879 --> 19:59.170
I remember that one
of my old teachers used to say,

19:59.462 --> 20:02.794
"The road to excellence is gruelling

20:03.337 --> 20:05.669
but, Lord, it's so exhilarating!"

20:06.128 --> 20:08.295
Gentlemen, be excellent!

20:08.711 --> 20:11.128
Your parents have chosen Valmont to make you...

20:11.378 --> 20:13.128
A real fairy tale.

20:13.377 --> 20:14.794
Nobody knew about it?

20:15.128 --> 20:16.252
Not even you?

20:16.586 --> 20:19.045
Nerio's caution was legendary, as you know.

20:19.502 --> 20:22.169
I found out last night,
when Jacques Wallenberg called me,

20:22.419 --> 20:23.377
the swiss lawer.

20:23.628 --> 20:24.919
He is Nerio's executor.

20:26.586 --> 20:28.669
I'm sure you'll agree that
an inheritance of twenty billion dollars...

20:28.918 --> 20:31.127
is enougn to insight envy.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.169
In fact, the young man isn't even called Winch

20:33.419 --> 20:36.085
but Winczlav, Nerio's real name.

20:36.793 --> 20:38.585
So can we meet this heir?

20:40.501 --> 20:45.085
(Sao Jose Prison Mato Grosso State Brazil)

21:40.875 --> 21:42.374
Freeze!

21:42.875 --> 21:44.125
My passport! Quick!

21:44.583 --> 21:46.583
- Mr Winczlav! You are... - Passport!

21:47.124 --> 21:48.249
Freeze, I said!

21:48.833 --> 21:49.625
Largo?

21:52.666 --> 21:53.666
Freddy?

21:54.666 --> 21:57.208
Hello, Largo.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.374
You are free, Mr Winczlav!

22:01.124 --> 22:02.749
I didn't ask for your help.

22:03.124 --> 22:05.790
- How would you manage? - I have my own way.

22:22.789 --> 22:24.040
They went that way!

22:24.290 --> 22:25.706
Move it!

22:34.165 --> 22:37.289
Find them!

22:38.040 --> 22:40.247
Find them!

22:54.206 --> 22:55.247
It's my car.

22:56.539 --> 22:57.539
I have my own way.

23:01.331 --> 23:02.413
Drive!

23:04.997 --> 23:05.955
What are you doing?

23:06.206 --> 23:07.538
I have my own way, ok!

23:38.204 --> 23:39.913
I don't like your own way.

23:41.412 --> 23:43.079
It's a while since I saw you.

23:43.912 --> 23:44.870
Three years.

23:45.579 --> 23:47.953
I've changed. I've learned stuff.

23:48.204 --> 23:48.912
Such as?

23:49.162 --> 23:51.162
Stuff Swiss schools don't teach.

23:58.245 --> 24:00.037
I really don't like your own way.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.620
- Well, you haven't changed.
- I consider that a compliment.

24:40.702 --> 24:41.827
Never happy, huh?

24:42.035 --> 24:43.118
Look out!

25:12.368 --> 25:13.701
My foot's trapped!

25:16.950 --> 25:18.493
Don't stay here, Largo!

25:21.368 --> 25:22.909
Get out!

25:23.159 --> 25:24.326
Shut up!

25:45.033 --> 25:46.116
Thanks.

25:51.699 --> 25:54.200
Tell Nerio, I'm too old to be brought home.

25:54.741 --> 25:56.200
Your father's dead, Largo.

26:01.574 --> 26:02.574
The Group's spokesman has admitted that

26:02.824 --> 26:06.949
Nerio Winch had been suffering from
a brain tumor for the last few months

26:44.739 --> 26:46.073
Mister Winch...

26:50.073 --> 26:51.240
Come in.

26:57.364 --> 26:59.864
In the name of this hospital and as its director,

27:00.530 --> 27:03.030
I would like to express my sincere condolences.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.155
Before you father's cremation.

27:10.072 --> 27:14.780
I took the liberty of conducting a second,
more detailed post mortem.

27:15.863 --> 27:17.947
Being that you are the only member of his family,

27:18.863 --> 27:21.738
I'll give you the sole copy of the report.

27:23.404 --> 27:24.571
It's up to you,

27:24.821 --> 27:27.446
if you choose to make it public or not.

27:33.279 --> 27:34.737
I had the honour of knowing your father,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.530
he was an exceptional man and... a generous donor.

27:38.446 --> 27:39.987
You expect people to pity you?

27:40.987 --> 27:42.612
Not when you inherit 20 billion!

27:42.862 --> 27:44.279
Don't you get it?

27:44.779 --> 27:46.279
I don't want the inheritance.

27:47.112 --> 27:50.904
Get this straight, Largo.
The destiny that awaits you

27:51.153 --> 27:53.071
takes precedence.

27:53.904 --> 27:55.487
I don't want to become like you.

27:57.153 --> 28:02.195
You scare people. They hate you.
That's why you're alone.

28:03.529 --> 28:05.653
Loneliness is the price of power.

28:07.529 --> 28:10.986
And I'm not entirely alone.
I have you: you're my son.

28:12.070 --> 28:14.278
I can pass things on. That matters.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.736
Money. Always money...

28:18.986 --> 28:20.569
That's not what I meant.

28:23.528 --> 28:25.027
You see this knife?

28:25.528 --> 28:27.402
It's worth just a few dollars...

28:27.653 --> 28:30.653
Yet it's my most precious belonging.

28:32.528 --> 28:34.277
My father drank like a fish.

28:35.194 --> 28:37.402
He used to beat my mother and me.

28:37.652 --> 28:39.111
Nearly every evening.

28:39.527 --> 28:43.777
When I was 13,
I worked in secret for the village grocer.

28:44.360 --> 28:48.318
After a few months,
I could buy the thing I dreamed of.

28:48.819 --> 28:50.110
When he tried again,

28:50.360 --> 28:52.777
I threatened to kill him
if he didn't let us leave.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.610
For the first time, he was scared of me.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.693
He could see I was serious,

28:58.943 --> 29:00.443
that I'd do as I said.

29:07.901 --> 29:09.401
There's what life gives you...

29:10.526 --> 29:12.110
...and what you do with it!

29:13.275 --> 29:14.776
Those are the two forces

29:16.442 --> 29:17.901
that make you what you are.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.067
Here.

29:30.817 --> 29:31.900
It's yours.

30:12.941 --> 30:13.899
Hello, sir.

30:14.148 --> 30:18.065
Forgive this informal awakening.
You were deaf to my verbal endeavours.

30:25.148 --> 30:25.981
And you are?

30:26.232 --> 30:28.815
Gauthier, sir. Your late father's butler.

30:29.107 --> 30:31.564
Please accept my condolences, sir.

30:34.273 --> 30:35.606
Mr Freddy dropped you off.

30:35.856 --> 30:37.648
You seemed very tired indeed.

30:38.272 --> 30:39.815
The journey, no doubt.

30:42.606 --> 30:44.231
The alcohol, Gauthier.

30:45.272 --> 30:46.439
The alcohol.

30:52.106 --> 30:54.939
I took the liberty to clean your clothes.

30:55.189 --> 30:58.563
Yet I'm afraid your undershirt
is beyond redemption.

31:02.314 --> 31:03.605
I should have warned you.

31:03.855 --> 31:05.730
There's a slight swell today.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.313
When he moved to Hong Kong,
your father settled on this yacht.

31:12.563 --> 31:14.730
I think he liked the view.

31:15.105 --> 31:16.355
I'm not surprised.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.063
Already an invitation for you, sir.

31:21.397 --> 31:25.188
Mr Korsky requests your presence
for lunch at "Amber".

31:25.813 --> 31:26.562
Korsky?

31:26.938 --> 31:29.521
Mikhail Korsky, 42, from Georgia,

31:29.771 --> 31:33.521
head of the Korsk Corporation.
Rich from gunrunning.

31:33.771 --> 31:38.354
However, for some years now,
he has moved into more worthy fields.

31:38.604 --> 31:39.938
Real estate, banking...

31:40.187 --> 31:44.104
No one knows his exact worth
but everyone agrees it's colossal.

31:44.354 --> 31:48.937
Three years ago,
someone attempted to poison Mr Korsky...

31:49.187 --> 31:50.562
Gauthier...

31:50.812 --> 31:52.562
...and left him marked for life.

31:54.020 --> 31:55.562
Are you always so precise?

31:55.812 --> 31:58.937
I trained at the
Regent Street Gentlemen's School, sir.

32:00.895 --> 32:04.979
No one knows his face or his name, but there
have been rumors of a mysterious heir.

32:05.228 --> 32:08.020
The heir is...
the famous billionaire's adopted son...

32:08.270 --> 32:09.895
No... No, no, no, no, no... I swear!

32:10.144 --> 32:11.103
No! I didn't know!

32:12.645 --> 32:14.478
Look... Look... I'll call him...

32:14.728 --> 32:16.186
I'll find out and I'll call you back...

32:17.395 --> 32:20.103
Yes... I know... I know...

32:21.311 --> 32:25.186
Look, I promise you I... Hello?

32:29.978 --> 32:31.477
Damn!

32:35.185 --> 32:37.102
- Good morning, Mr Meyer. - Good morning,

32:37.394 --> 32:39.018
Have you heard about this heir business?

32:39.269 --> 32:41.435
Don't pay too much attention
to these rumours Rebecca...

32:41.893 --> 32:43.686
But he's here! He's with the board now!

32:43.977 --> 32:46.185
As executor, I can tell you that

32:46.394 --> 32:51.060
Mr Winch's desire was always very clear.

32:51.310 --> 32:56.768
The one and only heir to his fortune
has to be his adopted son.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.601
But there's no rhyme or reason to it!

33:00.060 --> 33:01.226
I mean here's a boy

33:01.852 --> 33:03.060
from Lord knows where

33:03.434 --> 33:07.101
and who claims to be the heir of the world's
fifth largest fortune...

33:07.393 --> 33:08.726
It's outrageous.

33:09.351 --> 33:13.059
Mr Wallenberg, have you previously met
or even glimpsed this young man?

33:13.309 --> 33:15.434
Nerio's always liked to keep his secrets secret...

33:15.684 --> 33:17.892
Have you, yes or no, met this man before today?

33:20.226 --> 33:21.309
No.

33:22.934 --> 33:26.184
So, in short, nobody knows you.

33:26.433 --> 33:27.892
Where is the proof?

33:28.101 --> 33:30.350
You must think we're stupid, young man.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.767
You don't know whom you're dealing with here!

33:32.017 --> 33:34.600
With good lawyers,
we could drag this out for years!

33:34.851 --> 33:36.809
And that is exactly what we're going to do!

33:39.225 --> 33:40.808
Mister Kwan, is that right?

33:41.058 --> 33:42.058
That's right, yes.

33:42.766 --> 33:46.267
William Kwan. Nerio admired
your university career. Princeton,

33:46.517 --> 33:49.683
Harvard. Your mother must be very proud
of you after raising you on her own.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.516
Do you still check the knot of
your tie everytime you feel awkward?

33:55.391 --> 33:59.474
Nerio told me about you.
Nerio told me about everyone of you.

33:59.724 --> 34:02.891
So believe me,
I know exactly whom I'm dealing with.

34:03.433 --> 34:05.683
Nerio anticipated your reactions.

34:06.015 --> 34:08.141
Shortly after I was adopted, he transferred all...

34:08.391 --> 34:11.391
his majority holdings to the Anstalt,
based in Liechtenstein.

34:11.641 --> 34:14.974
Now Mr Wallenberg,
could you explain to our friends here

34:15.224 --> 34:17.514
the specific workings of that company?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.556
The shares are "bearer" shares...

34:21.514 --> 34:26.764
In other words, the person who physically has
those shares is the owner of the company...

34:27.764 --> 34:29.931
In this way, the company can be passed on

34:30.181 --> 34:33.139
without paying any inheritance tax

34:33.514 --> 34:38.723
and to become the new owner,
the heir has only to recover the shares...

34:39.348 --> 34:41.723
Ten shares, to be precise!

34:42.139 --> 34:46.431
Ten shares hidden in a location that
I am the only one to know about.

34:46.681 --> 34:48.597
And that's all the proof that I need!

34:50.014 --> 34:51.056
Now, of course

34:51.304 --> 34:54.139
if you still feel like contacting
your lawyers, please go ahead.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.597
I just spoke to Miss Pennywinkle...

34:59.848 --> 35:01.889
There is no way you'll be able
to have an appointment...

35:02.139 --> 35:04.013
with the heir before next week...

35:04.264 --> 35:05.431
Next week?

35:08.472 --> 35:11.180
Surely you don't intend to... run the Group?

35:11.638 --> 35:13.264
I have only one attention.

35:14.763 --> 35:16.722
Find out who killed Nerio Winch.

35:18.596 --> 35:23.014
Until someone proves otherwise,
his death was accidental.

35:23.263 --> 35:24.388
You believe so?

35:25.763 --> 35:29.221
I believe someone has decided to take over
the group by any means possible.

35:29.638 --> 35:30.887
Where do you think you are?

35:31.805 --> 35:33.096
- Mister Winch? - Meyer?

35:33.346 --> 35:36.013
I am sorry but I really must talk to you.

35:36.929 --> 35:41.762
My god! He got shot!

36:28.344 --> 36:30.011
Please forgive me, Mister Winch.

36:31.052 --> 36:33.136
Stephan Marcus... Head of security for the group.

36:39.510 --> 36:40.552
Mister Marcus!

36:40.802 --> 36:42.635
Do you mind explaining what is going on?

36:43.552 --> 36:45.260
Sorry Miss Pennywinkle...

36:46.719 --> 36:48.218
The famous Miss Pennywinkle...

36:49.094 --> 36:50.802
Pleased to meet you, Mister Winch.

36:55.051 --> 36:57.468
Alexandre Meyer...
He works in the finance department.

36:57.719 --> 36:58.468
Worked.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.801
He left me a message this morning.
Extremely tense.

37:01.051 --> 37:03.218
He wanted to know
if the story about the heir was true...

37:04.801 --> 37:05.676
What are you doing?

37:05.926 --> 37:07.634
I don't think the police would like this,
Mr Winch...

37:08.676 --> 37:09.718
Mr Meyer?

37:10.676 --> 37:12.801
I have Mr Korsky for you.

37:16.175 --> 37:18.259
- Korsky - Korsky?

37:18.509 --> 37:20.217
What does Meyer have to do with that crook?

37:20.801 --> 37:24.050
- Korsky's invited me to lunch today.
- Absolutly out of the question!

37:29.134 --> 37:30.884
I have an appointment with Mister Korsky...

37:31.134 --> 37:32.175
Please follow me, sir.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.050
Icham

37:40.300 --> 37:41.134
Let him go

37:51.091 --> 37:52.258
Forgive him...

37:54.633 --> 37:56.716
Icham always likes to do his job properly.

37:57.466 --> 37:59.258
Such a rare quality these days...

38:00.049 --> 38:01.049
That's right.

38:01.716 --> 38:03.341
I'm going down to the spa...

38:09.549 --> 38:10.549
Naomi,

38:11.008 --> 38:12.340
divine, isn't she?

38:14.382 --> 38:15.424
Surprising.

38:17.132 --> 38:19.090
I'm going to buy out the W Group.

38:22.591 --> 38:23.549
You think so?

38:23.798 --> 38:24.965
IMX

38:26.673 --> 38:27.840
Does that sound familiar?

38:28.090 --> 38:30.340
- I've heard of it.
- Of course you've heard of it!

38:30.673 --> 38:32.631
It's an investment fund that,

38:32.965 --> 38:35.090
as we speak, owns...

38:37.923 --> 38:39.673
Six percent of the W Group...

38:39.923 --> 38:42.007
And do you know who this fund belongs to?

38:42.548 --> 38:43.631
To you.

38:44.756 --> 38:49.464
For the last few weeks, I've been buying out
all the available shares of the W Group.

38:49.756 --> 38:52.590
And I know exactly who to buy them from.

38:53.506 --> 38:54.839
Thanks to a certain Meyer...

38:55.256 --> 38:56.797
I'm the story's bad guy.

38:57.381 --> 38:58.339
You're perfect.

39:00.797 --> 39:04.922
Nerio's death has upset the market.
So today, I'm shifting into higher gear...

39:07.297 --> 39:10.338
In exactly twenty minutes,
I'll be announcing my takeover bid.

39:11.755 --> 39:13.464
I preferred to tell you in person.

39:14.213 --> 39:17.005
I find it more... more elegant.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.088
I didn't know gun running brought in so much...

39:22.422 --> 39:28.338
They... They always say
the first billion is suspect.

39:28.921 --> 39:30.088
Two weeks from now,

39:30.338 --> 39:32.421
I'll be at the head of the W Group

39:32.671 --> 39:35.504
and believe me, everyone will forget

39:35.755 --> 39:37.254
the errors of my youth...

39:38.129 --> 39:41.421
If it's respectability you're after,
there are more effective ways...

39:42.254 --> 39:44.254
Give your 13 billion to UNICEF...

39:44.504 --> 39:48.837
And, believe me... Everyone will forget
the errors of your youth as you say...

39:49.546 --> 39:52.421
With a little bit of luck, you might
even receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

39:54.546 --> 39:55.712
Why not?

39:56.879 --> 40:00.545
But everything in its time.
First I'm going to buy you out.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.378
You know you're wasting your time.

40:02.628 --> 40:05.920
The group's capital is blocked.
I hold a 65%. majority share...

40:06.170 --> 40:09.004
From what I hear... that has yet to be proved.

40:09.253 --> 40:10.670
You don't have to worry about that.

40:20.086 --> 40:21.128
Come in!

40:32.003 --> 40:33.753
Be gentle please.

40:39.085 --> 40:40.210
Very good, madam.

40:47.835 --> 40:49.419
That was a quick lunch.

40:50.918 --> 40:53.501
Ever since I was in jail, I've lost my appetite.

40:54.585 --> 40:55.877
You were in jail?

41:00.668 --> 41:03.293
A very pretty girl put me there.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.376
She vanished after a very pleasant night.

41:11.168 --> 41:13.293
But left a souvenir in my pocket.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.543
What do you know about her?

41:20.084 --> 41:21.084
Nothing.

41:22.584 --> 41:25.043
Well, I remember one particular thing.

41:25.834 --> 41:28.834
A beauty mark on her buttock,
the left one I think.

41:30.043 --> 41:31.625
Or the right. I'm not sure.

41:34.667 --> 41:36.083
I'll get another masseur.

41:43.542 --> 41:46.500
Take your clothes off. Lie down.
I'll be back in two minutes.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.374
Your car is ready.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.875
Find out all you can about her, Freddy.

42:02.249 --> 42:03.541
After she got me arrested,

42:03.791 --> 42:06.957
this girl told a friend where to find me.

42:07.207 --> 42:09.249
Perhaps she fell madly in love with you.

42:09.915 --> 42:12.625
Or letting your friend know was part of the trap.

42:13.207 --> 42:14.374
What trap?

42:14.790 --> 42:16.540
You'll find out sooner or later.

42:17.832 --> 42:19.665
(Republic of Croatia)

42:19.916 --> 42:26.624
(3 years earlier)

42:58.497 --> 43:00.623
See, they haven't changed a thing.

43:01.789 --> 43:03.997
Not defending yourself, soldier?

43:09.914 --> 43:12.247
- When do you finish? - In six months.

43:14.830 --> 43:16.247
But I'll sign on for longer.

43:19.705 --> 43:21.496
That was my last year here.

43:24.205 --> 43:27.538
And... the photos at Vlatko's party?

43:29.538 --> 43:33.705
- In the green album, I think. - I'll get it.

44:09.703 --> 44:11.995
He won't say where he adopted me.

44:13.370 --> 44:14.536
Was this the place?

44:20.286 --> 44:21.786
I have the right to know, Hannah.

44:35.453 --> 44:39.869
I'm categorical. Adopted children
have no legal access to their files.

44:40.452 --> 44:41.410
Listen,

44:41.744 --> 44:43.368
I've come a long way.

44:44.535 --> 44:47.327
Do me a favour, let me take a look.

44:48.202 --> 44:50.036
It's important for me.

44:50.577 --> 44:53.285
The law is the law. I didn't make it.

45:20.826 --> 45:22.743
Hands up, bastard!

45:25.159 --> 45:26.451
What are you doing here?

45:37.825 --> 45:40.617
I hesitated about posting bail for you.

45:40.909 --> 45:42.159
I think I pitied you.

45:42.408 --> 45:43.575
Thanks for everything.

45:46.076 --> 45:46.784
Well?

45:47.034 --> 45:48.825
I have good news and bad news.

45:49.075 --> 45:50.909
- The bad? - The good first.

45:52.116 --> 45:56.283
I spent the night there and got into the archives.

45:57.116 --> 45:58.492
I looked everywhere.

45:59.241 --> 46:00.575
I searched the whole place.

46:01.657 --> 46:03.450
But your file wasn't there.

46:04.824 --> 46:05.991
It must be someplace else.

46:06.866 --> 46:09.783
I asked. All the files are there.

46:12.908 --> 46:14.115
I'm sorry, Largo.

46:18.824 --> 46:22.074
Mister Korsky, what are your comments
today on the Winch Corporation takeover?

46:22.741 --> 46:24.657
I had a great admiration for Nerio Winch.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.657
But, today, I think my takeover bid

46:27.115 --> 46:30.698
is the best possible thing that could happen
to the group which bears his name.

46:31.032 --> 46:32.366
And what is your next move?

46:33.366 --> 46:35.157
I'm going to buy some sweets.

46:35.823 --> 46:36.865
Thank you!

46:37.115 --> 46:39.239
Korsky's takeover bid is warmly
welcomed on the markets...

46:39.490 --> 46:42.198
This smells bad... Very bad.

46:42.823 --> 46:45.156
With the blocking minorities called into play,

46:45.406 --> 46:47.782
Korsky is going to be like poison.

46:48.323 --> 46:50.031
Let's work out an agreement.

46:50.698 --> 46:52.490
It's the most sensible thing to do.

46:53.281 --> 46:54.365
No!

46:55.406 --> 46:56.864
What do you suggest?

46:58.073 --> 46:59.822
A counter takeover bid on Korsky.

47:00.073 --> 47:01.530
You don't do things by halves.

47:01.781 --> 47:05.447
Nerio knew that Korsky was plotting something.

47:06.739 --> 47:09.073
We had a defence plan. Just in case...

47:09.781 --> 47:13.572
And as you all know,
Nerio's best defence was attack.

47:13.822 --> 47:16.238
Except that you're going to be
attacking a ghost company...

47:16.530 --> 47:19.781
The Korsk shareholder base is spread out
over a host of companies

47:20.030 --> 47:21.821
based in various tax heavens.

47:22.072 --> 47:23.696
Korsky probably bought out Meyer,

47:23.905 --> 47:26.905
but I've got one better...
I've got someone in his personnal entourage.

47:27.155 --> 47:29.529
- Who's your spy? - That doesn't matter.

47:29.947 --> 47:32.322
Only the result matters. Take a look.

47:34.238 --> 47:36.279
Korsky's best kept secret...

47:38.571 --> 47:39.905
You see, my dear Mister Kwan,

47:40.446 --> 47:43.321
the Korsk's shareholder base isn't so mysterious.

47:43.696 --> 47:45.904
We have options on 19% of the shares...

47:46.613 --> 47:48.987
Our takeover bid will be a complete surprise.

47:49.655 --> 47:50.946
And a crushing victory.

47:51.238 --> 47:52.862
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

47:53.112 --> 47:54.279
The law obliges us

47:54.529 --> 47:57.528
to inform the other company that
it is the object of a takeover bid.

47:57.779 --> 47:59.862
Korsky will have time to find a riposte.

48:00.112 --> 48:02.946
If a takeover bid is made by a private individual,

48:03.196 --> 48:06.362
acting in his own name,
there is no need to announce it.

48:07.071 --> 48:08.320
They won't see it coming.

48:09.695 --> 48:12.695
My rough guess is that such an operation
could cost three billion...

48:13.195 --> 48:14.654
Do you have that much in your account?

48:15.028 --> 48:15.986
No, I don't...

48:19.654 --> 48:21.861
Well, I don't have it on me...

48:22.195 --> 48:24.237
And that's what bankers are for, Largo...

48:25.694 --> 48:28.569
- William, you have to lend him the money.
- You can't be serious?

48:28.819 --> 48:30.569
You want Korsky to eat us alive?

48:30.819 --> 48:32.653
You're asking me to lend three billion

48:32.945 --> 48:34.361
to some kid from God knows where?

48:34.653 --> 48:36.070
You must be dreaming!

48:36.361 --> 48:38.653
At least wait until Monday's general meeting!

48:38.903 --> 48:40.319
No, we don't have the time.

48:40.569 --> 48:43.110
I refuse to take that risk without any guarantees.

48:49.152 --> 48:52.568
What if I give you t he shares
in the Anstalt as a guarantee, Ms Kwan.

48:56.527 --> 48:57.735
Would that suit you?

49:04.151 --> 49:06.109
I'll be back with the shares in 24 hours.

49:07.652 --> 49:10.068
You'll appreciate the irony of this, Largo.

49:10.527 --> 49:14.151
The impostor is suddenly our saviour.

49:16.692 --> 49:17.901
A little too simple.

49:18.568 --> 49:21.318
Show me the telephone Miss Pennywinckle gave you

49:22.692 --> 49:26.651
A GPS will be enough to track you

49:27.400 --> 49:28.442
Alright

49:31.734 --> 49:33.818
You won't say where you're going?

49:37.651 --> 49:39.858
You like secrets. Like your father.

49:42.567 --> 49:46.608
I spent 20 years at his side
without even suspecting your existence.

49:48.775 --> 49:53.983
(3 years earlier)

49:54.234 --> 49:56.358
For how long?

49:57.025 --> 49:58.817
Two years minimum. Renewable.

50:04.441 --> 50:05.149
Let me through.

50:05.608 --> 50:07.024
Excuse me a second.

50:07.399 --> 50:08.441
Carry on.

50:15.982 --> 50:16.982
I'm listening.

50:20.941 --> 50:23.857
My orphanage file. I want it.

50:24.108 --> 50:25.607
I don't know what you mean.

50:25.899 --> 50:28.398
I went there. I went to the orphanage.

50:29.524 --> 50:31.899
- Who told you? - Forget that. I went there.

50:32.607 --> 50:34.190
My file's the only one missing.

50:36.856 --> 50:38.190
You should have told me.

50:40.565 --> 50:42.107
You don't go behind my back.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.940
You never told me anything!

50:44.981 --> 50:46.689
You're a Winch, Largo.

50:47.399 --> 50:48.481
You're my son.

50:49.273 --> 50:50.981
Nothing else matters.

50:51.898 --> 50:54.648
The past belongs to the past. What matters...

50:55.731 --> 50:56.856
is your future!

50:59.106 --> 51:02.689
That file is the only thing
that really belongs to me.

51:04.773 --> 51:06.106
It's mine.

51:06.689 --> 51:07.939
It's my history.

51:09.147 --> 51:10.772
So you'll give it back to me.

51:11.564 --> 51:12.939
Who do you think you are?

51:14.189 --> 51:15.563
I want my file.

51:18.939 --> 51:20.689
- I don't have it. - Liar!

51:23.106 --> 51:24.772
Don't insult your father.

51:29.647 --> 51:30.855
You're not my father.

51:31.105 --> 51:34.063
That's not for you to decide.

51:41.397 --> 51:43.021
Give me that file back.

51:43.771 --> 51:44.938
I burned it.

51:48.396 --> 51:49.771
Find yourself another heir.

52:08.728 --> 52:15.770
(Republic of Croatia)

52:42.019 --> 52:44.727
Josip would never let you listen to that.

52:50.185 --> 52:52.394
- You got my message?
- How long can you stay?

52:53.227 --> 52:55.519
That's Freddy. He called 15 minutes ago.

53:02.519 --> 53:03.560
Freddy?

53:03.893 --> 53:06.352
I have stuff on Naomi, Korsky's girl.

53:06.601 --> 53:07.810
She's a sort of escort girl,

53:08.060 --> 53:11.227
often involved in shady business deals.

53:11.643 --> 53:14.726
- Who does she work for? - Money.

53:15.268 --> 53:16.226
And for Korsky.

53:16.476 --> 53:18.601
She's been with him a month.

53:19.434 --> 53:22.934
But she vanished this morning.
Korsky's going frantic.

53:23.226 --> 53:24.518
How do you know that?

53:25.017 --> 53:27.685
I've always had good informers. Nerio loved that.

53:29.685 --> 53:30.767
Take care, Largo.

53:31.017 --> 53:32.226
Give Gauthier my love.

53:37.725 --> 53:40.059
You know, I think I'll do the same as Nerio.

53:41.350 --> 53:42.475
Get cremated.

53:43.308 --> 53:46.183
It's silly but I imagine the wind
carrying my ashes off.

53:47.392 --> 53:49.100
I feel as if I'll be free then.

53:50.809 --> 53:53.767
Whereas being cramped in a tiny box...

53:58.058 --> 54:01.100
And do you think I'll still be free?

54:03.808 --> 54:05.308
That depends on you, Largo.

54:08.141 --> 54:10.058
He had it all worked out.

54:11.058 --> 54:13.016
Even dead, he still decides.

54:18.933 --> 54:21.641
Go to bed. Your room's ready for you.

55:27.888 --> 55:29.055
Where's Largo?

55:33.013 --> 55:35.346
You're going to have to be very cooperative.

55:37.805 --> 55:39.388
Where's Largo?

55:43.680 --> 55:47.388
"I've gone to Sarjevane. See you later."

57:46.675 --> 57:49.175
The last monks left the island in 1908.

57:51.217 --> 57:53.342
The perfect escape from the rat race.

58:02.466 --> 58:04.883
We'll come here every year for a month.

58:08.633 --> 58:10.799
I'll teach you your future business.

58:59.172 --> 59:00.631
Thank you, Mister Winch.

59:02.922 --> 59:04.715
You've done just what we expected of you.

59:06.506 --> 59:09.006
Take the shares out of the safe
and slide them over to me.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.089
No sudden moves.

59:17.006 --> 59:20.380
- Who are you working for?
- For you, Mister Winch...

59:21.547 --> 59:22.672
Drop the knife.

59:22.922 --> 59:24.964
- I asked you a question.
- And I gave you an order.

59:30.171 --> 59:32.171
I suppose these people work for me too...

59:32.589 --> 59:34.130
Model employees.

59:34.380 --> 59:35.422
I can see that.

59:35.714 --> 59:37.171
I hope you get a risk bonus...

59:42.671 --> 59:44.005
Don't shoot!

59:51.421 --> 59:52.963
Don't shoot him!

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.337
Now we can shoot him!

01:02:17.624 --> 01:02:19.624
You should have heeded your instinct.

01:02:21.957 --> 01:02:24.750
You knew someone was pulling the strings.

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:28.541
Someone who wanted you to fetch the shares

01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:33.623
since you alone knew where they were hidden.

01:02:38.832 --> 01:02:40.124
And now...

01:02:45.582 --> 01:02:47.081
What do you plan to do?

01:02:47.332 --> 01:02:48.623
Largo!

01:03:21.913 --> 01:03:23.205
Hannah?

01:03:26.414 --> 01:03:30.247
Hannah...

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.663
Hannah...

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.080
Hannah...

01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:13.866
What do you mean, vanished?

01:06:14.116 --> 01:06:15.741
He was supposed to be here last night.

01:06:16.033 --> 01:06:17.991
I can't reach him... No one knows where he is.

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.908
- Is this some kind of a joke? - I knew it.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.491
We have to cancel the general meeting!

01:06:21.741 --> 01:06:23.991
We'll prepare a press release...
We have to find an excuse...

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:27.991
To panic the shareholders...
And pave the way for Korsky, certainly not!

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.991
You're out of your depth. I won't let you
lead this group to its ruin.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.115
I am acting in the sole interest of the group!

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:36.532
Unlike you, for I have no personal ambition.

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:38.032
You don't have the stature for it.

01:06:38.282 --> 01:06:40.365
And you're losing your cool.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.615
Largo Winch is our only chance of survival.

01:06:44.115 --> 01:06:45.573
The general meeting is maintained.

01:06:45.823 --> 01:06:48.407
And you'll better not stop praying
that Nerio's heir appears.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.240
I don't think that's the best thing
that could happen to us.

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:54.531
Your Largo Winczlav escaped from
a prison in South America

01:06:54.782 --> 01:06:56.865
where he was being held for drug trafficking.

01:06:57.115 --> 01:06:59.907
An international warrant for his arrest
was issued out this morning...

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.281
Good news. We'll end up finding him now.

01:07:03.531 --> 01:07:06.198
You still think that this heir
is the best way to save the Group?

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:09.573
The general meeting will go ahead
as planned, tomorrow.

01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:12.572
We have 24 hours to come up with a solution...

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.739
Hi, Largo.

01:07:43.072 --> 01:07:44.988
Don't worry, I didn't recognize you either.

01:07:53.905 --> 01:07:56.863
You see, I didn't set off to see the world.

01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:01.237
I took over as doctor from my father.

01:08:01.488 --> 01:08:02.655
Melina...

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:04.613
But I haven't ruled it out.

01:08:07.321 --> 01:08:08.404
Turn over.

01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:16.071
My cousin found you by the roadside.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.319
It's a miracle you're alive
with a wound like this.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:24.319
I'm invincible.

01:08:27.612 --> 01:08:28.986
There.

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.362
What happened?

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:41.903
I don't remember a thing.

01:08:47.527 --> 01:08:48.986
I'm sorry.

01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:03.652
He's going to call, I can tell.

01:09:08.902 --> 01:09:10.277
No, Mister Kwan.

01:09:10.526 --> 01:09:12.443
I have no idea where he can be.

01:09:20.443 --> 01:09:21.359
Largo...

01:09:21.652 --> 01:09:23.276
Thank you, Lord! Thank you!

01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:26.859
Where are you?

01:09:27.193 --> 01:09:28.234
In heaven.

01:09:29.526 --> 01:09:31.026
You have to get me back, Freddy.

01:09:31.817 --> 01:09:34.026
Aren't you too old to be brought home?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.484
Do I come with you?

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:46.317
Let me handle it, Gauthier.

01:10:03.442 --> 01:10:05.483
Odd place for a meeting.

01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:08.733
I'd rather avoid the group's HQ.

01:10:08.983 --> 01:10:10.441
I don't want to end up like Meyer.

01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:20.191
Largo is alive. You missed him.
But I can tell you where he is.

01:10:21.899 --> 01:10:23.274
I don't understand...

01:10:23.525 --> 01:10:25.982
Don't give me that! Largo told me everything.

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:33.690
What is it you want?

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:38.024
Nerio Winch is dead. His son is on the run.

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:40.982
My career prospects aren't looking good.

01:10:41.232 --> 01:10:45.565
So my contact with Largo is the last card
I have left. The very last.

01:10:45.899 --> 01:10:47.273
And I plan to use it.

01:10:47.524 --> 01:10:49.023
You're full of shit.

01:10:49.273 --> 01:10:52.482
Largo is dead. I know, I'm the one who killed him.

01:10:52.732 --> 01:10:53.898
I know.

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:57.315
One bullet. Fired from a helicopter.

01:10:58.065 --> 01:11:01.148
He fell into the sea. You thought he was dead.

01:11:01.564 --> 01:11:03.981
Now who on earth could have told me all that?

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.106
Wait!

01:11:09.773 --> 01:11:12.940
I'm not talking to you again.
I deal with your boss from now on.

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:38.271
You're expected. No funny business.

01:11:47.313 --> 01:11:49.522
Come in, Mr Kaplan.

01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:57.562
Just fine-tuning tomorrow's speech.
The surroundings help, don't you find?

01:11:59.188 --> 01:12:01.395
I'm no expert on long speeches.

01:12:07.063 --> 01:12:08.479
Don't judge me.

01:12:09.813 --> 01:12:11.896
Appearances can be misleading.

01:12:13.437 --> 01:12:16.646
I did it all for the group. Only for the group.

01:12:18.521 --> 01:12:21.145
And if Marcus is to be believed,

01:12:21.396 --> 01:12:23.603
you're in no position to preach at me.

01:12:24.104 --> 01:12:26.520
Was killing Nerio in the group's interests?

01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:30.520
He was sick and dying. You know that.

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.062
But you had him killed.

01:12:32.978 --> 01:12:34.937
I had to keep control of timing.

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:41.436
I'd never leave the group in the hands
of some wild adventurer like Largo.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.936
You use strange methods...

01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:50.520
The only person who can take over
from Nerio Winch is me.

01:12:51.311 --> 01:12:52.560
Maybe.

01:12:53.811 --> 01:12:56.019
But you need to convince the meeting.

01:12:56.936 --> 01:13:00.644
I have one last card to play
that will win me the game.

01:13:02.394 --> 01:13:04.185
So, Mr Kaplan,

01:13:06.769 --> 01:13:08.769
where is our friend Largo?

01:13:12.143 --> 01:13:14.893
He'll call me to say where to pick him up.

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:17.976
How much?

01:13:18.976 --> 01:13:22.060
Much more than what your spy
in Korsky's firm cost you.

01:13:23.518 --> 01:13:25.601
- A figure. - Not a cent.

01:13:29.518 --> 01:13:32.935
Mail me the plans for your attack on Korsk Inc.

01:13:33.768 --> 01:13:37.518
In two weeks, if I carefully invest my savings,

01:13:37.768 --> 01:13:40.768
you'll make me a rich man. A very rich man.

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.726
Insider trading...

01:13:44.184 --> 01:13:46.934
Nerio must have rubbed off on you too.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.184
This is what we'll do.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.433
Stay at the hotel with Marcus.

01:13:56.558 --> 01:13:58.976
In a few minutes, you'll receive

01:13:59.225 --> 01:14:01.392
the plan for the Korsk takeover bid.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:05.183
Then you'll just need to wait for Largo's call.

01:14:06.767 --> 01:14:08.891
In a few hours, it will all be over.

01:14:10.058 --> 01:14:11.725
Good night, Mr Kaplan.

01:14:17.016 --> 01:14:18.557
Don't miss him this time.

01:14:27.183 --> 01:14:29.307
Sure your friend will come?

01:14:35.808 --> 01:14:37.015
Look.

01:14:40.723 --> 01:14:41.932
I'll be back.

01:14:42.474 --> 01:14:43.599
What for?

01:14:45.307 --> 01:14:46.515
To see you.

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:50.182
Don't talk rubbish.

01:14:51.765 --> 01:14:54.015
Go on. Off you go.

01:15:37.013 --> 01:15:39.222
This is the asshole of the world, here!

01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:40.721
It's my home.

01:15:41.514 --> 01:15:43.638
I don't believe a word of
what you told me on the phone.

01:15:43.888 --> 01:15:44.888
But you came anyway.

01:15:45.138 --> 01:15:47.721
I can't help it, I'm a gambler.

01:15:48.638 --> 01:15:52.429
But I'm warning you, I hate to lose.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.012
Straight from Ferguson's office...

01:16:03.429 --> 01:16:06.929
Any minute now, your group will be
taken over by the W Group.

01:16:13.346 --> 01:16:14.804
Who gave them these informations?

01:16:16.012 --> 01:16:17.263
Naomi.

01:16:18.054 --> 01:16:19.428
Naomi...

01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:21.387
She works for Ferguson.

01:16:26.262 --> 01:16:27.303
Icham!

01:16:28.762 --> 01:16:30.470
Slit this bastard's throat!

01:16:33.178 --> 01:16:34.554
That's why she vanished.

01:16:37.512 --> 01:16:41.053
Ferguson organized everything.
She's the one who had Nerio killed...

01:16:41.303 --> 01:16:44.594
She's the one who manipulated Meyer to pass
on information to you about the Group.

01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:46.678
And she's the one who had him killed
when he panicked.

01:16:46.928 --> 01:16:49.302
- That's absurd! - No it's not, it's smart!

01:16:49.553 --> 01:16:51.636
You had to be persuaded to attack us!

01:16:52.386 --> 01:16:55.177
There had to be a threat to force me
to get my shares.

01:16:55.594 --> 01:16:57.553
You are the bad guy in the story!

01:16:58.261 --> 01:16:59.969
But Ferguson wrote that story!

01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:06.635
Let's have a drink!

01:17:07.802 --> 01:17:09.510
Let's see if you're a real gambler now...

01:17:10.052 --> 01:17:11.927
Withdraw your takeover bid.

01:17:13.094 --> 01:17:14.261
Without that threat,

01:17:14.552 --> 01:17:17.760
Ferguson won't be able to convince
the general meeting to give her full powers.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.093
And I'll take care of the rest.

01:17:24.427 --> 01:17:25.802
Over my dead body.

01:17:29.009 --> 01:17:30.385
You're going to lose everything.

01:17:34.968 --> 01:17:39.343
Yeah. Will that be all?

01:17:41.634 --> 01:17:42.759
Take me to Hong Kong.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:47.259
The general meeting starts tomorrow at 11 h.
I've got to be there.

01:17:48.551 --> 01:17:49.718
You and I are the same.

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.884
Two dirty foreigners.

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.217
People like Ferguson despise us.

01:17:54.676 --> 01:17:55.842
Cheers!

01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:25.924
In dollars... That's what you wanted?

01:18:26.174 --> 01:18:27.425
I prefer security...

01:18:28.508 --> 01:18:30.258
If you don't mind, I'll count it.

01:18:32.258 --> 01:18:34.841
It's a pleasure to work
with a professional like you.

01:18:37.799 --> 01:18:40.008
Don't get carried away, Marcus.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.298
You couldn't afford me.

01:18:57.257 --> 01:18:58.549
Good to hear you, Largo.

01:19:00.756 --> 01:19:03.090
I checked your mail. It was there.

01:19:03.548 --> 01:19:05.299
My new pals loved it.

01:19:06.048 --> 01:19:06.881
I'm coming back with them.

01:19:08.048 --> 01:19:09.132
Good.

01:19:10.381 --> 01:19:11.881
Where do I pick you up?

01:19:16.047 --> 01:19:17.715
Ok. See you later.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.131
He's waiting for me.

01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:41.964
I've had a wire on Korsky's phone
for months now...

01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:44.547
And Largo just called you from that very phone.

01:19:49.171 --> 01:19:52.005
The board of directors will hold
a general meeting at eleven o'clock...

01:19:58.546 --> 01:20:00.255
The Winch Group is now a fortress under siege.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:04.963
It will have to name a general or the enemy
Korsky will claim a crushing (victory)...

01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:15.629
The general meeting
must accept the mysterious heir

01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:19.753
or leave the door open to a takeover by Korsk Inc.

01:20:44.295 --> 01:20:46.128
Are you looking for someone?

01:20:48.336 --> 01:20:49.461
The trunk.

01:21:01.794 --> 01:21:02.961
He can't be far.

01:21:04.419 --> 01:21:07.294
Do you know a body international
warrant that's up on you?

01:21:08.085 --> 01:21:11.502
I'm sure that a man like can
help me bypass the formalities.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.252
You're going to have 25 minutes
to reach the meeting.

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:19.710
My driver will take you there. You'll be fine.

01:21:23.085 --> 01:21:25.252
I have to be at the Grand Hyatt by 11 o'clock.

01:21:29.793 --> 01:21:31.793
Not too tired from the flight, sir?

01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:33.918
It's kind of you to pick me up.

01:21:35.501 --> 01:21:38.585
The usual chauffeur took too many sleeping pills.

01:21:40.543 --> 01:21:42.585
Sign. At the bottom, on the right.

01:21:44.585 --> 01:21:45.585
A marriage contract?

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:47.209
An I.O. U.

01:21:47.459 --> 01:21:48.667
The fare's pretty high.

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.084
It's my rate.

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:54.876
I think I forgot the child lock.

01:21:56.126 --> 01:21:57.459
Marcus is here.

01:21:57.834 --> 01:21:59.417
He'll pay to find you.

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:02.333
You won't do that.

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:08.625
Marcus? I have something for you.

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.041
6 feet tall, dark hair, green eyes...

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:12.833
I'm on the Ku Lan road.

01:22:16.624 --> 01:22:18.083
You're really nothing but a...

01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:23.458
Only guys like you can afford to despise money.

01:22:25.749 --> 01:22:26.666
Pen?

01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:37.750
There's a guy in the presidential suite.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:40.790
Ferguson has planned everything.

01:22:43.665 --> 01:22:46.832
When this young man called me yesterday,
I was sceptical.

01:22:47.332 --> 01:22:51.540
But I have to admit that his story
seems perfectly credible.

01:22:54.082 --> 01:22:55.749
Here's his orphanage file.

01:22:57.749 --> 01:23:01.790
Largo's relationship with his adopted father

01:23:02.123 --> 01:23:04.331
had become strained in recent years.

01:23:05.998 --> 01:23:08.831
You know Largo is wanted for drug trafficking?

01:23:09.665 --> 01:23:11.956
Yes, I was informed of that.

01:23:13.498 --> 01:23:16.497
When he heard that Largo was on drugs and dealing,

01:23:16.873 --> 01:23:19.706
Mr Winch decided to change his heir.

01:23:22.248 --> 01:23:23.789
And he gave him these.

01:23:32.456 --> 01:23:36.330
The shares in the Zunkunft Anstalt.

01:25:08.286 --> 01:25:11.785
Sadness yes! But also joy!

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:15.036
The joy of continuing his work,

01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:17.327
of respecting his memory.

01:25:18.201 --> 01:25:22.118
Today, friends, partners, rivals,

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:25.619
we should take a moment to remember his life.

01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:35.993
It all started on the 13th of august 1933,

01:25:36.368 --> 01:25:39.492
in a little village in Bosnia-Herzegovnia.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.367
Born into a modest family,

01:25:41.618 --> 01:25:46.076
Nerio Winch's childhood was,
in his own words, difficult...

01:27:26.989 --> 01:27:28.572
Are you crazy?

01:27:32.739 --> 01:27:33.864
I want all the gates closed!

01:27:34.114 --> 01:27:35.781
Yes sir. All the gates are closed, sir.

01:28:22.571 --> 01:28:24.446
... Nerio Winch was one of those men,

01:28:24.695 --> 01:28:27.528
who were born to change the world they live in.

01:28:43.487 --> 01:28:44.944
... And a bottle of wine...

01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:50.195
I don't know. The best...

01:29:18.902 --> 01:29:20.860
Too late, Largo.

01:29:21.152 --> 01:29:22.568
No, not yet.

01:29:24.152 --> 01:29:25.485
Look at yourself.

01:29:26.818 --> 01:29:28.277
And look at me.

01:29:28.985 --> 01:29:31.943
Who's going to want you as the heir? Who?

01:29:35.526 --> 01:29:36.693
This group,

01:29:38.026 --> 01:29:39.318
this money,

01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:41.193
they're mine.

01:29:42.693 --> 01:29:44.151
As much as yours.

01:29:46.942 --> 01:29:49.151
Deep down, you started it all.

01:29:51.443 --> 01:29:54.817
You shouldn't have asked me
to go with you that night.

01:29:59.442 --> 01:30:01.817
I looked for your file for hours.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.609
I knew it mattered to you.

01:30:08.359 --> 01:30:09.858
I didn't find it.

01:30:11.484 --> 01:30:15.733
But I came across something
much more interesting for me.

01:30:18.733 --> 01:30:21.441
When he first went there, Nerio Winczlav

01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:24.816
left with two children.

01:30:26.358 --> 01:30:27.691
Me...

01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:29.524
And you, Largo.

01:30:33.024 --> 01:30:37.608
He knew he'd come back for you one day,
so he took two children.

01:30:39.191 --> 01:30:41.650
Hannah and Josip couldn't have kids.

01:30:42.483 --> 01:30:45.732
He gave them the gift of a child. Me.

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:49.857
And to you... he gave a destiny!

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:58.523
I don't believe in luck.
I don't believe in coincidence.

01:30:58.899 --> 01:31:03.065
I believe that each man
holds his destiny in his hands.

01:31:16.773 --> 01:31:18.106
He would have told me.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.190
He always wanted to make all the decisions.

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:28.522
Your life. Mine. Hannah's.

01:31:30.356 --> 01:31:32.397
I should never have found out.

01:31:33.439 --> 01:31:36.147
But unfortunately I did.

01:31:39.147 --> 01:31:42.939
I wanted Nerio to know
he didn't control everything.

01:31:44.272 --> 01:31:45.813
I went to see him.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.313
I threatened to go public with it.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.855
And he gave you money.

01:31:52.313 --> 01:31:54.022
But he made a mistake.

01:31:54.688 --> 01:31:56.980
He told Ferguson everything.

01:31:57.355 --> 01:31:59.063
Ferguson found me

01:31:59.313 --> 01:32:03.647
and she offered me
much, much more money than he did.

01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:06.271
On one condition.

01:32:07.438 --> 01:32:09.146
That I head the group

01:32:10.396 --> 01:32:13.021
and be content with the dividends.

01:32:17.562 --> 01:32:18.729
Put it inside!

01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:26.729
You can understand why I accepted.

01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:41.312
Did you accept Hannah's death too?

01:32:43.645 --> 01:32:45.062
What are you talking about?

01:33:00.977 --> 01:33:02.603
She'd dead, Goran.

01:33:07.186 --> 01:33:08.685
They killed her.

01:33:30.435 --> 01:33:31.560
Listen,

01:33:32.851 --> 01:33:36.268
I'll grab his gun while you smash his head in.

01:33:37.018 --> 01:33:37.893
What?

01:33:38.143 --> 01:33:40.601
You heard me right! Do it!

01:35:14.348 --> 01:35:16.431
Your father struggled too.

01:36:25.137 --> 01:36:26.595
It's nothing.

01:36:31.096 --> 01:36:38.136
Everything's fine. Just fine.

01:37:31.135 --> 01:37:34.635
Today we are at a turning point in our history.

01:37:36.134 --> 01:37:38.260
Our founder has passed away.

01:37:38.885 --> 01:37:43.593
A group with an appalling reputation has
made a hostile take-over bid against us.

01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:47.552
But we must stick together to fight it.

01:37:50.592 --> 01:37:51.926
What do you want?

01:37:52.592 --> 01:37:54.551
... Leaving a surprise in store for us

01:37:54.801 --> 01:37:58.884
which will ensure the continued
success of our group...

01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:01.051
My dear friends,

01:38:01.634 --> 01:38:05.008
twenty-seven years ago, Nerio Winch...

01:38:11.634 --> 01:38:14.883
I did it all for the group. Only for the group.

01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:17.925
Was killing Nerio in the group's interests?

01:38:18.175 --> 01:38:21.175
He was sick and dying. You know that.

01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:23.758
But you had him killed.

01:38:23.967 --> 01:38:26.675
I had to keep control of things.

01:38:28.175 --> 01:38:30.383
When Nerio told me he had cancer,

01:38:30.675 --> 01:38:32.716
he also told me about his heir. I asked about him.

01:38:32.967 --> 01:38:34.049
I'd never leave the group

01:38:34.299 --> 01:38:39.091
in the hands of some wild adventurer like Largo.

01:38:39.716 --> 01:38:42.633
It was madness on Nerio's part. A whim.

01:38:43.799 --> 01:38:48.466
In 6 months, Largo would have destroyed
everything Nerio had built up.

01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:50.133
This group that,

01:38:51.133 --> 01:38:52.632
with all due modesty,

01:38:52.882 --> 01:38:54.715
I consolidated with him.

01:38:55.674 --> 01:38:57.966
I have the shares, as agreed.

01:38:59.173 --> 01:39:01.132
Well done, Largo. You win.

01:39:03.132 --> 01:39:05.382
But how will you use this?

01:39:15.756 --> 01:39:18.298
Ladies and gentlemen, please!

01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:20.589
allow me to introduce...

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.297
Nerio Winch's heir.

01:39:24.132 --> 01:39:25.631
Mister Largo Winch!

01:40:14.462 --> 01:40:16.713
...Cleared of all accusations of drug trafficking,

01:40:16.963 --> 01:40:21.421
the new CEO's first decision was to reach
an agreement with Mikhail Korsky

01:40:21.671 --> 01:40:25.796
to put an end to hostilities
between Korsk and the W Group.

01:40:26.045 --> 01:40:28.129
The Group's spokesman has admitted that

01:40:28.379 --> 01:40:32.462
Nerio Winch had been suffering
from a brain tumor for the past few months.

01:40:33.045 --> 01:40:36.504
Even if the wildest rumors have been circulating,

01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:40.837
his death does, indeed,
seem to have been an accident...

01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:48.129
Ma'am, you can board now.

01:41:01.712 --> 01:41:02.919
Do you have a stamp?

01:41:03.503 --> 01:41:04.961
I can post it for you.

01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:10.086
You should write your name on the back...

01:41:40.501 --> 01:41:41.835
Hands up!

01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:48.710
- What's your name? - Danis Vlatkovic.

01:41:49.835 --> 01:41:51.293
Hello, Danis.

01:41:51.918 --> 01:41:53.585
You're on my territory!

01:41:55.710 --> 01:41:57.001
I'm leaving.

01:41:57.710 --> 01:41:59.084
Will you let me go?

01:42:03.959 --> 01:42:05.001
Thank you.

01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:12.667
How about you? What's your name?

01:42:16.667 --> 01:42:18.125
Largo Winch!

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:22.500
Take care, Largo Winch!
