I called you over and over.
‐ I‐‐I know.

18:51.281 --> 18:53.035
I'm sorry,
and I did get your messages.

18:53.035 --> 18:54.956
And I tried to call you.
‐ Well, not hard enough.

18:54.956 --> 18:57.377
Jesus Christ. You've scared
the shit out of me.

18:57.377 --> 18:58.588
‐ Okay, I'm sorry.

18:58.588 --> 19:00.926
So Mom went to Vancouver?
Did she say why?

19:00.926 --> 19:03.472
‐ No, she just‐‐
she just said she's gone.

19:03.472 --> 19:05.894
‐ That's insane. I don't‐‐

19:05.894 --> 19:07.313
And why is Ron here?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.152
‐ Well, Ron is here because
Ron answers his telephone.

19:10.152 --> 19:12.282
‐ Okay.
‐ Oh, my God.

19:12.282 --> 19:13.702
‐ Fran?
‐ Yeah, we got Fran

19:13.702 --> 19:15.496
hangin' with us.
‐ Oh, yeah, Fran's hanging

19:15.496 --> 19:17.500
because your dad called me
and didn't know where you were

19:17.500 --> 19:19.296
and we thought
you were murdered,

19:19.296 --> 19:21.466
but thank God you're alive
and just inconsiderate.

19:21.466 --> 19:24.974
‐ I'm sorry.
We didn't have any service.

19:24.974 --> 19:26.644
‐ We.
‐ Yeah‐‐

19:26.644 --> 19:28.857
‐ Who are you?
Am I completely out of the loop

19:28.857 --> 19:30.611
on every God damn thing
in this family?

19:30.611 --> 19:34.075
‐ Well, okay, this isn't
how I imagined this moment,

19:34.075 --> 19:36.748
but Dad, this is
my boyfriend, Ryan.

19:36.748 --> 19:39.127
BILL: Your boyfriend.

19:39.127 --> 19:40.296
Jeez, okay.

19:40.296 --> 19:42.467
‐ I know this isn't,
like, a good time,

19:42.467 --> 19:44.429
um, uh, but I just wanna say

19:44.429 --> 19:47.686
Annie is such a good woman.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.356
‐ Ryan, you're
a very, very lucky guy.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.651
‐ I can't believe
I didn't know this.

19:50.651 --> 19:51.945
‐ Very.
‐ Fran, do you know

19:51.945 --> 19:53.740
this Ryan?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.451
‐ No. Are you the guy

19:55.451 --> 19:58.290
who was cutting women's
pony tails off on the bus?

19:58.290 --> 20:00.086
‐ No.
‐ My God.

20:00.086 --> 20:01.589
[smoke alarm beeping]

20:01.589 --> 20:03.760
‐ Grub's on!
BILL: Oh, jeez.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.346
ANNIE: What?

20:05.346 --> 20:09.062
Did you put the boxes in
at 500 degrees?

20:09.062 --> 20:12.068
RON: I am not a chef.
[laughs]

20:12.068 --> 20:13.947
‐ Fine, but, Dad, no, no.

20:13.947 --> 20:14.991
You're gonna hurt yourself.
‐ Calm down.

20:14.991 --> 20:16.326
I'm not a hundred years old.

20:16.326 --> 20:18.372
‐ Yeah, okay,
but you've been sick, you know.

20:18.372 --> 20:20.001
‐ You're overreacting. It's‐‐
‐ Fine‐‐

20:20.001 --> 20:21.086
‐ Whoa!
‐ Oh!

20:21.086 --> 20:22.088
‐ Don't shoot, you fuck!
‐ All right,

20:22.088 --> 20:23.424
everybody take it slow.

20:23.424 --> 20:26.304
‐ [grunts]
‐ [Annie yelps]

20:26.304 --> 20:29.352
‐ Yeah, man!
That is what I'm talking about!

20:29.352 --> 20:31.106
Whoo!
‐ What the fuck?

20:31.106 --> 20:33.193
‐ I needed something metal
to bash the fucker.

20:33.193 --> 20:35.072
‐ Annie, your boyfriend
has a gun?

20:35.072 --> 20:37.410
‐ Only because we were camping.
It's fine.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.959
Everybody just calm down.
‐ Well, it doesn't seem fine!

20:40.959 --> 20:44.132
Fuck.
Is that blood on your dress?

20:44.132 --> 20:45.510
‐ Yes.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.096
But it's...

20:47.096 --> 20:49.685
Because I got my period.

20:49.685 --> 20:51.939
‐ Yes, and that's how
periods work.

20:51.939 --> 20:53.275
So we should get you changed.
‐ Yes.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.277
‐ And can I talk to you
for a sec?

20:54.277 --> 20:55.947
ANNIE: Yeah.

21:00.832 --> 21:02.001
‐ This is psychotic.
My mom just up and left?

21:02.001 --> 21:03.838
Truly,
is everyone off the rails?

21:03.838 --> 21:05.091
‐ What's going on?

21:05.091 --> 21:06.384
Why did you have blood
on yourself?

21:06.384 --> 21:08.055
‐ Well, I went last night

21:08.055 --> 21:10.142
to confront my troll
at his house.

21:10.142 --> 21:11.228
‐ When? Alone?

21:11.228 --> 21:13.650
That's fucking scary
and stupid.

21:13.650 --> 21:14.693
Honestly, it sounds like
you're the one

21:14.693 --> 21:16.196
who's off the rails.
‐ What?

21:16.196 --> 21:17.323
I'm not off the rails.

21:17.323 --> 21:20.204
I am the rails.
‐ Okay, slow down.

21:20.204 --> 21:21.541
You did something dangerous,

21:21.541 --> 21:24.087
and then you and Ryan
just ran away from it all.

21:24.087 --> 21:25.214
I had to come all the way here

21:25.214 --> 21:26.634
and miss a hair appointment
today.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.805
You couldn't even text me
or your dad.

21:28.805 --> 21:30.141
Think about that.
‐ Yeah, I mean,

21:30.141 --> 21:32.103
I went to Ryan
because he's my boyfriend

21:32.103 --> 21:34.190
and he actually supports me
about the stuff

21:34.190 --> 21:35.401
that I care about in my life.

21:35.401 --> 21:37.071
‐ Yeah, or you knew he was
the only person

21:37.071 --> 21:39.660
who wouldn't question you.

21:39.660 --> 21:42.708
‐ I mean...maybe. Yes.

21:42.708 --> 21:46.006
But Fran, I'm‐‐
I'm really sorry.

21:46.006 --> 21:48.970
Like, I know that I've been
a piece of shit

21:48.970 --> 21:50.347
and a really bad friend.

21:50.347 --> 21:51.601
‐ I don't wanna fight with you,
Annie,

21:51.601 --> 21:53.478
but you can't just disappear
and then leave me

21:53.478 --> 21:55.024
to clear up all your mess.

21:55.024 --> 21:56.903
You have to be my friend, too.

21:56.903 --> 21:59.909
‐ I know, I know.
I'm just‐‐

21:59.909 --> 22:04.042
I'm trying to be the person
that I actually wanna be.

22:04.042 --> 22:06.631
‐ And is this who you wanna be?
‐ [laughs]

22:06.631 --> 22:09.010
Absolutely not.
‐ [laughs]

22:09.010 --> 22:10.722
‐ This is a nightmare.

22:10.722 --> 22:12.809
Not at all.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.479
‐ Oh, you smell horrible.

22:14.479 --> 22:17.026
‐ Yeah, I really do.
‐ [laughs] Yeah.

22:17.026 --> 22:19.573
‐ Ryan went down on
my two‐day puss in the woods.

22:19.573 --> 22:22.245
‐ That's good, but call me
when he eats your ass.

22:22.245 --> 22:23.665
[both laugh]
[door opens]

22:23.665 --> 22:26.127
‐ Hey, your mom's on the phone.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.090
‐ Oh, shit.

22:28.090 --> 22:32.641
‐ Okay. Good.

22:32.641 --> 22:35.145
They actually let you pet them.
Well, wow.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.526
‐ Wh‐‐when's she coming back?
‐ Good.

22:37.526 --> 22:39.404
Okay.

22:39.404 --> 22:41.408
Yeah, we'll see you soon.

22:41.408 --> 22:43.579
I love you, too.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.669
Okay, well, I feel better.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.965
‐ What happened?

22:48.965 --> 22:51.136
‐ She's in Vancouver.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.725
She said she needed a break
from the stress

22:53.725 --> 22:56.814
She wanted
to recharge her batteries.

22:56.814 --> 22:58.400
‐ That's it?
You didn't get anything else?

22:58.400 --> 22:59.737
‐ I don't know.
That's all she said.

22:59.737 --> 23:01.239
It's fine.

23:01.239 --> 23:03.201
It's between her and me.

23:03.201 --> 23:04.830
The family drama's over, okay?

23:04.830 --> 23:06.124
Everybody can head on out.

23:06.124 --> 23:08.003
I'm gonna hang out with Ron,

23:08.003 --> 23:09.213
and you can go back to work.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.719
‐ Yeah, I'll stay awake
if you need me.

23:11.719 --> 23:16.102
‐ Um, actually, I quit my job.

23:16.102 --> 23:17.898
‐ Annie, you didn't.
‐ What?

23:17.898 --> 23:20.235
‐ Yes, I did.
‐ Cool, right?

23:20.235 --> 23:21.947
‐ Well, this is exactly
the kind of stress

23:21.947 --> 23:23.116
I don't need.

23:23.116 --> 23:25.496
I don't understand.
What happened?

23:25.496 --> 23:29.630
‐ Well, my boss‐‐
he‐‐he wasn't letting me do,

23:29.630 --> 23:31.592
you know, what I wanna do.

23:31.592 --> 23:33.971
‐ Which is every boss on earth

23:33.971 --> 23:35.474
in every job on earth.

23:35.474 --> 23:36.727
What is going on with you?

23:36.727 --> 23:39.232
‐ Look, Dad, you know,
this is a good thing.

23:39.232 --> 23:41.194
I'm shaking my shit up
a little bit.

23:41.194 --> 23:43.407
You know, taking a chance
on myself.

23:43.407 --> 23:45.578
I think I'm actually
figuring things out.

23:45.578 --> 23:48.333
‐ That was a great job, Annie.

23:48.333 --> 23:51.381
And you were doing so well.

23:51.381 --> 23:53.886
What are you gonna do now?

23:53.886 --> 23:55.765
‐ Listen, Bill,

23:55.765 --> 23:57.309
when you're young
you take risks

23:57.309 --> 23:59.439
and do crazy shit.

23:59.439 --> 24:03.781
Once, on a dare, I kissed
a dead dog on the road.

24:03.781 --> 24:05.618
And look at me now.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.037
I got this.

24:07.037 --> 24:10.795
Your daughter's got it, too.
Right, Annie?

24:10.795 --> 24:13.968
‐ Yeah. I got this.

24:13.968 --> 24:16.932
I got this.

24:16.932 --> 24:19.771
I‐‐I got this.
