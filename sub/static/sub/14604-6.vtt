00:00.051 --> 00:01.846
Before there was sex...

00:01.850 --> 00:04.320
before there was the
city, there was just me,

00:04.721 --> 00:07.489
Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw
from Castlebury, Connecticut.

00:07.491 --> 00:08.590
What do you think you're doing?

00:08.592 --> 00:10.125
I wanna be exclusive. Is that okay?

00:10.127 --> 00:12.093
Maggie, what are you doing here?

00:12.095 --> 00:14.395
- Didn't realize you were with somebody.
- Uh, neither did I.

00:14.397 --> 00:15.963
- Are you gonna tell Carrie?
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

00:15.965 --> 00:18.733
Having sex for the
first time is a big deal.

00:18.735 --> 00:21.635
Hopefully, it can... it
can be special with me.

00:21.637 --> 00:23.905
- Are you sure?
- Really sure. I'm ready.

00:23.907 --> 00:26.107
Nobody saw you, right?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.574
- 'Cause if your dad found out...
- He won't.

00:27.576 --> 00:30.510
I have been in close contact with my ex.

00:30.512 --> 00:32.779
- How close?
- Just as friends.

00:32.781 --> 00:35.481
This is where I wanna be, with you.

00:38.252 --> 00:39.986
Flopping your closet can be exhausting...

00:41.389 --> 00:42.655
But going from summer to fall...

00:42.657 --> 00:44.489
Is one of the best times of the year.

00:48.362 --> 00:50.295
because you get to do away with
your flimsy, sticky tube tops

00:50.297 --> 00:52.898
that offer no support or protection

00:52.900 --> 00:54.967
and snuggle into cozy sweaters

00:54.969 --> 00:57.870
and things that make
you feel warm and safe.

00:58.972 --> 00:59.637
And the added bonus...

00:59.639 --> 01:01.439
you never know what
you'll find from last year.

01:02.642 --> 01:04.108
A 20.

01:04.110 --> 01:05.910
Your favorite lip gloss.

01:05.912 --> 01:09.080
An unopened lollipop.

01:09.082 --> 01:10.882
Your ex-boyfriend's coat.

01:10.884 --> 01:12.750
There was nothing safe about that.

01:14.886 --> 01:16.486
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:22.061 --> 01:24.494
Oh, no. Fall cleaning?

01:24.496 --> 01:25.628
Is it already that time again?

01:25.630 --> 01:27.364
Yes. And you say that every year.

01:27.366 --> 01:30.167
Ohh. You and your mother with the closets.

01:30.169 --> 01:32.101
She loved doing this, too.

01:32.103 --> 01:33.502
I know.

01:33.504 --> 01:35.404
Well, do you also know that
you run out of steam every year

01:35.406 --> 01:37.139
and leave half your closet on the floor?

01:37.141 --> 01:39.075
Rome wasn't built in a day, dad.

01:39.077 --> 01:42.245
And I'll clean this all up soon, I promise.

01:42.247 --> 01:43.445
Just not right now.

01:43.447 --> 01:45.147
I gotta go or I'll be
late for my writing class.

01:45.149 --> 01:47.916
Ah, we're gonna be looking
at this for weeks, aren't we?

01:47.918 --> 01:49.217
Lucky for you,

01:49.219 --> 01:52.287
you don't have to be looking
at any of this at all.

01:56.426 --> 01:57.625
This class is so intense.

01:57.627 --> 01:58.726
Professor Tenley gave us

01:58.728 --> 02:00.095
an open-ended writing assignment.

02:00.097 --> 02:05.199
As in, no guidelines, no
parameters, no anything.

02:05.201 --> 02:08.301
And it's gonna count for, like,
half my grade, so it matters..

02:08.304 --> 02:10.704
How am I supposed to find
something to write about?

02:10.705 --> 02:13.073
Okay, take a breath.

02:13.075 --> 02:14.674
You... you have to exhale, too.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.844
Right. Some... sometimes
I forget that part.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.514
Hey, don't freak out.
This is assignment's cool.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.951
No rules means you can
really find you as a writer.

02:24.953 --> 02:27.453
Well, me as a writer
might be a crazy person

02:27.455 --> 02:28.821
because I have no idea

02:28.823 --> 02:31.690
how I'm even going to
begin to pick a topic.

02:31.692 --> 02:33.659
Nothing's coming to mind.

02:33.661 --> 02:35.127
Or everything's coming to mind.

02:36.330 --> 02:39.064
Like, the history of
trains popped into my head.

02:39.066 --> 02:41.099
Random but a start.

02:41.101 --> 02:44.102
I just... I can't seem to
get a single solid thought

02:44.104 --> 02:46.138
from my brain to the paper.

02:46.140 --> 02:48.006
That's called writer's block.

02:48.008 --> 02:50.975
Hey. Hey. Don't look so devastated.

02:50.977 --> 02:52.376
It's... it's an important
part of the process,

02:52.378 --> 02:56.080
like, uh, self-flagellation
and hating yourself.

02:56.082 --> 02:57.581
Putting your head in the oven.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.318
That's what I have to look forward to?

03:00.320 --> 03:01.685
Writer's block is a good thing. Okay?

03:01.687 --> 03:04.188
I've been through this a lot, so trust me.

03:04.190 --> 03:06.824
You just need to embrace it.

03:06.826 --> 03:09.225
And quit the class?

03:09.227 --> 03:11.394
All I want to do is go shoe shopping.

03:11.396 --> 03:12.929
Is that bad?

03:12.931 --> 03:15.932
Ah. You're in the procrastination phase.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.400
All good writers do that.

03:17.402 --> 03:18.468
They do?

03:18.470 --> 03:20.636
Yeah. It gives your mind time to settle.

03:20.638 --> 03:23.305
So what do you like to
do when you procrastinate?

03:23.307 --> 03:29.011
Oh, I like to take long
showers or, uh... have sex.

03:29.013 --> 03:30.312
Or have sex in the shower.

03:30.314 --> 03:32.348
What?

03:32.350 --> 03:34.683
Don't talk about sex on a crowded street!

03:34.685 --> 03:37.152
Really?

03:37.154 --> 03:39.553
I didn't realize you were such a prude.

03:39.555 --> 03:40.754
Excuse me?

03:40.756 --> 03:42.390
But after what we did last night,

03:42.392 --> 03:44.225
you cannot call me a prude.

03:45.395 --> 03:48.129
I'm just a lady in public.

03:48.131 --> 03:50.465
So does that mean you, uh...

03:50.467 --> 03:52.933
don't wanna procrastinate with me?

03:52.935 --> 03:56.003
I can't. I have to get focused.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.844
Feel better?

04:04.846 --> 04:06.413
I don't know.

04:06.415 --> 04:07.580
I definitely don't feel worse.

04:10.552 --> 04:12.284
Here's the thing.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.553
Whatever you least want to write about,

04:14.555 --> 04:15.754
whatever scares you the most,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.856
that's what you have to write about.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.459
That's the good stuff.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.729
Truly great writers can't
stay in a safe space.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.032
That was the scariest thought of all.

04:26.034 --> 04:29.501
I had no idea what made
me feel most unsafe...

04:30.669 --> 04:33.604
while West knew exactly
how to keep himself safe.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.273
How was the guidance counselor?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.408
Was it horrible in there?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.309
Not at all. I'm actually excited about

04:38.311 --> 04:40.211
some of the safety schools she recommended.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.612
Excited?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.380
Did you just say "excited"?

04:43.382 --> 04:46.183
How could you use the word
"excited" and "safety school"

04:46.185 --> 04:47.351
in the same sentence?

04:47.353 --> 04:49.653
Hey, it feels good to
have a solid backup plan.

04:49.655 --> 04:50.987
Are you sure you don't
want to meet with her?

04:50.989 --> 04:53.157
She came in on a Saturday just for this.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.624
No. I'm not meeting with her.

04:54.626 --> 04:57.461
Safety schools are for people
who aren't getting into Harvard,

04:57.463 --> 04:58.628
and I'm getting into Harvard.

04:58.630 --> 04:59.962
I really hope so.

04:59.964 --> 05:01.564
But the guidance
counselor highly recommends

05:01.566 --> 05:03.566
applying to at least one.

05:03.568 --> 05:05.268
Even the most skilled trapeze artists

05:05.270 --> 05:06.502
use safety nets.

05:06.504 --> 05:10.440
Ugh. Is that the lame analogy she used?

05:10.442 --> 05:13.609
Why would I take guidance from her, anyway?

05:13.611 --> 05:15.510
She went to UConn.

05:15.512 --> 05:18.213
How can you be so snobby,
stubborn, and seductive

05:18.215 --> 05:19.647
all at the same time?

05:19.649 --> 05:21.183
Lots of practice.

05:21.185 --> 05:23.085
Mouse, I respect your chutzpah,

05:23.087 --> 05:25.153
but I still think you're
making a bad decision.

05:25.155 --> 05:26.521
You know the word "chutzpah"?

05:26.523 --> 05:29.591
Yeah. The guidance
counselor taught it to me.

05:31.659 --> 05:35.262
In New York City, a true
sign of a serious relationship

05:35.264 --> 05:38.332
is helping your boyfriend
move into his new place...

05:38.334 --> 05:39.833
especially when that new apartment

05:39.835 --> 05:42.536
is in the most dangerous part of town,

05:42.538 --> 05:46.873
otherwise known as Alphabet City.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.674
Thank God you're back.

05:48.676 --> 05:50.410
This place is freaking me out.

05:50.412 --> 05:51.611
Please tell me that this is temporary

05:51.613 --> 05:52.778
and you're just making a documentary

05:52.780 --> 05:54.080
about the tenements or something.

05:54.082 --> 05:56.116
This neighborhood has character.

05:56.118 --> 05:57.317
Yeah, shady ones.

05:57.319 --> 05:58.518
Look, I know it's not
the safest neighborhood,

05:58.520 --> 06:00.820
but it's mostly just
harmless crack addicts.

06:00.822 --> 06:01.921
And it's all I can afford

06:01.923 --> 06:04.456
since Stanford moved to Ibiza for the year.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.325
Are you gonna be okay
out here with the boxes?

06:06.327 --> 06:07.659
Sure.

06:07.661 --> 06:08.793
I once stood between

06:08.795 --> 06:11.730
my great Uncle Kenneth and the
liquor cabinet on Christmas.

06:11.732 --> 06:13.098
I can manage this.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.768
Smoke? Smoke?

06:16.770 --> 06:18.237
No!

06:19.671 --> 06:21.506
Thank you.

06:22.608 --> 06:24.575
Weaver's words are haunting
my every waking moment.

06:24.577 --> 06:26.544
Actually, my every sleeping moment, too,

06:26.546 --> 06:28.712
since I keep having
perfectly delightful dreams

06:28.714 --> 06:31.482
with nothing scary going on at all.

06:31.484 --> 06:32.650
Well, I dreamt last night

06:32.652 --> 06:34.185
that the Harvard mascot, John the Pilgrim,

06:34.187 --> 06:35.318
was chasing me.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.254
Oh, a college admission anxiety dream?

06:37.256 --> 06:39.789
I would kill for an anxiety dream.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.791
Then at least I would know
what I should write about.

06:41.793 --> 06:44.861
I just... I can't think
of one significant thing

06:44.863 --> 06:47.063
that makes me feel unsafe.

06:51.302 --> 06:52.901
Um...

06:52.903 --> 06:54.102
what are you doing?

06:54.104 --> 06:55.604
I don't want to make eye
contact with the condoms.

06:55.606 --> 06:58.073
Carrie, condoms don't have eyes.

06:58.075 --> 06:59.875
Well, you know what I mean.

06:59.942 --> 07:01.609
No, I really don't.

07:01.611 --> 07:04.612
I don't want people to see
I'm staring at the condoms

07:04.614 --> 07:06.513
and think I'm a perv or something.

07:06.515 --> 07:09.815
Having safe sex probably
means you're not a perv.

07:09.817 --> 07:11.651
That's a good point.

07:11.653 --> 07:13.453
Carrie Bradshaw.

07:13.455 --> 07:15.622
Here to pick up, um...

07:15.624 --> 07:17.290
you know... things.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.160
Thanks.

07:21.162 --> 07:23.495
Why are you whispering?

07:23.497 --> 07:25.130
Well, I don't need the whole world knowing

07:25.132 --> 07:26.965
I'm going on the pill.

07:26.967 --> 07:30.502
I don't think the whole
world is in this pharmacy.

07:32.872 --> 07:34.873
But Maggie is.

07:36.242 --> 07:38.843
Hi.

07:38.845 --> 07:40.177
It's funny seeing you here.

07:40.179 --> 07:42.413
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hey, Mouse.

07:42.415 --> 07:44.615
I... I'm just here for some... toothpaste.

07:44.617 --> 07:46.817
I... I'm here because, um...

07:46.819 --> 07:48.919
I... I think I have a cough.

07:52.191 --> 07:53.424
So how are you?

07:53.426 --> 07:55.625
Okay. Good.

07:55.627 --> 07:56.760
You?

07:56.762 --> 07:59.095
Pretty good.

07:59.097 --> 08:01.364
You know, besides... besides the cough.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.199
Yeah.

08:04.868 --> 08:06.670
Well, it was nice seeing you.

08:06.672 --> 08:09.306
Yeah. You, too.

08:09.308 --> 08:13.241
Maybe we can get together
sometime and talk.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.678
Yeah. Def... definitely.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.946
- Um, sometime.
- Good.

08:17.948 --> 08:20.148
Well, then...

08:21.717 --> 08:23.050
Bye.

08:23.052 --> 08:24.218
Bye.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.453
Bye, Mags!

08:25.455 --> 08:27.455
Did you just make plans with her?

08:27.457 --> 08:31.826
I know. It's weird, seeing her.

08:31.828 --> 08:34.094
It's like we're strangers.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.331
It's sad.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.530
I miss her.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.499
She misses you, too.

08:41.302 --> 08:44.438
What is taking so long
with my you-know-what?

08:44.440 --> 08:45.672
Just say it.

08:45.674 --> 08:47.974
Birth control pills.

08:47.976 --> 08:49.576
Carrie, you have issues.

08:49.578 --> 08:52.078
Oh, wow.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.179
I really do!

08:54.181 --> 08:56.349
I do have issues!

08:56.351 --> 08:59.251
I'm afraid to talk about... sex?

09:02.323 --> 09:05.290
I guess now I know what
I'm gonna write about.

09:11.655 --> 09:13.389
I know you two don't exactly get along,

09:13.391 --> 09:15.458
but I want to thank you
both for meeting me here.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.159
This is my office.

09:17.161 --> 09:18.661
You're meeting me here.

09:18.663 --> 09:20.730
Don't get hung up on details.

09:20.732 --> 09:24.266
Anyway, I called this
meeting because you two are

09:24.268 --> 09:26.535
the most confident and
perverted women I know.

09:26.537 --> 09:29.370
You always know how to charm me.

09:29.372 --> 09:30.439
And I'm a little apprehensive

09:30.441 --> 09:32.307
when it comes to talking about sex.

09:32.309 --> 09:34.142
- I've noticed.
- We've all noticed.

09:34.144 --> 09:37.145
Well, I'm going to face that fear head-on

09:37.147 --> 09:38.513
and write an essay about it.

09:38.515 --> 09:40.582
- About sex.
- Hallelujah.

09:40.584 --> 09:41.916
Are you finally gonna give up the goods

09:41.918 --> 09:44.117
on that genius writer of yours?

09:44.119 --> 09:45.185
How's his stamina?

09:45.187 --> 09:47.287
Forget stamina. How's his recovery time?

09:47.289 --> 09:49.156
Uh, uh, good. Good. Yeah.

09:49.158 --> 09:50.958
They're... they're both... very good.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.959
Are you on the pill yet?

09:51.961 --> 09:53.494
Fantastic.

09:53.496 --> 09:55.395
You'll put on 10 pounds, but it
does wonders for the complexion.

09:55.397 --> 09:56.764
Are his man parts magical?

09:56.766 --> 09:59.699
Size? Shape? Maneuverability?

09:59.701 --> 10:01.701
Is he more of a brownstone or a high rise?

10:01.703 --> 10:02.969
What does that even mean?

10:02.971 --> 10:05.004
She needs a frame of reference. Here.

10:06.374 --> 10:08.174
How does Weaver compare to my foot?

10:08.176 --> 10:11.544
Mnh! My eyes! Put that thing away.

10:11.546 --> 10:14.446
Weaver is, uh, it... he's just right.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.647
What's your favorite position?

10:15.649 --> 10:16.949
Have you tried a Moroccan mustache?

10:16.951 --> 10:18.684
Oh, I don't think so. What is that?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.085
Oh. It's like a Moroccan cigar,

10:20.087 --> 10:21.720
except you don't use as
much upper body strength.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.622
A reverse bat cave is my favorite.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.724
- I love a King Henry.
- Yeah, you would.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.859
It's a very subjugated position.

10:26.861 --> 10:28.894
Hey, it takes real
power to give up control.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.629
Last night, Harlan and I...

10:31.631 --> 10:32.930
Wait. Harlan?

10:32.932 --> 10:35.366
Like, Harlan Harlan?
My dad's friend Harlan?

10:35.368 --> 10:37.234
Yes. We're still together.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.402
And like a fine wine,

10:38.404 --> 10:40.638
our sex life has matured
into rich, bold flavors

10:40.640 --> 10:43.007
with a strong plum finish.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.409
Okay, you know what? I
just... I can't. I... I can't.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.343
I... I tried. I did, really.

10:47.345 --> 10:50.246
But I... I think I need to
do a little less research

10:50.248 --> 10:55.318
and a little more, you
know... time thinkin' about it.

10:56.821 --> 11:00.524
Clearly, you're gonna keep coming
around here to visit Carrie.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.790
Are you gonna ban me from the place?

11:01.792 --> 11:04.994
I'm gonna ban those
shoes. They are ghastly.

11:04.996 --> 11:06.495
They're new!

11:06.497 --> 11:07.863
For me, at least.

11:07.865 --> 11:10.666
Did you get them from someone
called Candy, by chance?

11:10.668 --> 11:13.268
No. Her name was Sapphire.

11:13.270 --> 11:16.204
I'm not gonna spend $300 on
a pair of avant-garde shoes

11:16.206 --> 11:17.506
like you do.

11:17.508 --> 11:19.574
And by "avant-garde," I mean "ugly."

11:19.576 --> 11:23.110
I don't buy my shoes,
luv. I get them for free.

11:23.112 --> 11:26.014
Hello! I work at "Interview" magazine.

11:26.016 --> 11:27.381
We have a wardrobe closet.

11:27.383 --> 11:29.450
And if you're gonna
keep hanging around here,

11:29.452 --> 11:31.853
I at least need to look
at something beautiful.

11:37.825 --> 11:40.527
I don't like 'em. They're boring.

11:40.529 --> 11:42.729
They're not boring. They're
just not made of plastic.

11:42.731 --> 11:44.264
Or pleather.

11:50.404 --> 11:52.738
What do you think of these?

11:52.740 --> 11:55.474
The legs or the heels?

11:55.476 --> 11:57.043
Oh, I know the legs are spectacular.

11:57.045 --> 11:58.844
I don't have to ask about them.

11:58.846 --> 12:00.312
Well, the heels are sexy,

12:00.314 --> 12:03.449
- and you are trouble.
- I assume you like trouble.

12:03.451 --> 12:04.584
Samantha,

12:04.586 --> 12:06.851
I see you've already met my beau Harlan.

12:06.853 --> 12:08.659
I didn't know.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.989
I know you didn't. It's okay.

12:09.992 --> 12:11.077
I'm impressed you possess the good taste

12:11.078 --> 12:13.458
- to flirt with him. Hello, darling.
- Hello.

12:14.661 --> 12:15.827
These are for you.

12:17.197 --> 12:19.130
Oh, how sweet!

12:19.132 --> 12:21.165
Oh, my

12:21.167 --> 12:23.133
I thought Barbara delivered
everything for you.

12:23.135 --> 12:24.568
I am so smitten with you

12:24.570 --> 12:26.971
I wanted to go out of my way
to see your gorgeous face.

12:26.973 --> 12:29.607
Mmm. You are so good to me.

12:29.609 --> 12:31.274
But now I have a meeting,
so you'll have to run along.

12:31.276 --> 12:32.442
Oh, I love it when you push me around.

12:32.444 --> 12:33.711
Mm-hmm.

12:37.916 --> 12:40.316
He's so thoughtful. He's always
taking care of me, buying gifts.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.986
I really should do something
nice for him in return.

12:44.454 --> 12:47.223
I think it would be fun to
keep a man like that happy.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.359
You're adventurous, right?

12:50.361 --> 12:52.528
That's one word for it.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.029
I'll pretty much go anywhere with anyone.

12:54.031 --> 12:55.864
Well, how about with me and Harlan?

12:55.866 --> 12:57.165
My only rule would be

12:57.167 --> 12:59.234
you'd have to wear the shoes of my choice.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.936
But I thought you hated me.

13:00.938 --> 13:02.570
Oh, these things always
go much more smoothly

13:02.572 --> 13:04.906
with people you don't have an affinity for.

13:04.908 --> 13:05.908
Agreed.

13:05.945 --> 13:07.143
Some of the hottest sex of my life

13:07.145 --> 13:08.812
has been with people I can't stand.

13:08.814 --> 13:10.780
And I definitely can't stand you.

13:10.782 --> 13:13.082
Perfect. So you're in then?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.884
For a threesome with you and Harlan?

13:14.886 --> 13:16.018
Absolutely.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.754
A threesome? No, I don't have threesomes.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.925
I have ménage à trois.

13:27.463 --> 13:29.464
Hey. Wanna join me?

13:29.466 --> 13:30.599
Why?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.166
I've been wanting to tell you something.

13:32.168 --> 13:33.802
I broke it off with that Vicky chick.

13:33.804 --> 13:35.369
I think she's a little
old to be called a chick.

13:35.371 --> 13:37.405
She's, like... 35.

13:37.407 --> 13:38.907
All right, the point is, it's over.

13:38.909 --> 13:40.675
So if you were planning
on telling Carrie about it,

13:40.677 --> 13:42.076
there's really no reason to now.

13:42.078 --> 13:44.277
Of course this conversation
was leading to Carrie.

13:44.279 --> 13:45.846
It only took you 30 seconds to get there.

13:45.848 --> 13:47.948
Can we talk about something else for once?

13:47.950 --> 13:49.149
Other people exist, too.

13:49.151 --> 13:51.819
I know. So sit, and let's talk.

13:56.024 --> 13:57.457
Carrie has a boyfriend now anyway,

13:57.459 --> 14:00.793
so I doubt she'd even
care about you and grandma.

14:00.795 --> 14:02.261
I didn't know.

14:02.263 --> 14:04.897
Someone from Manhattan, of course.

14:04.899 --> 14:06.165
Makes sense.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.767
Mouse told me he's a writer.

14:07.769 --> 14:09.568
Well, that's cool.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.337
I guess they have a lot in common then.

14:11.339 --> 14:12.739
Probably.

14:12.741 --> 14:14.372
What are you doing out here?

14:14.374 --> 14:17.308
Avoiding the riveting
college prep senior assembly.

14:17.310 --> 14:19.511
Yeah. Me, too.

14:19.513 --> 14:20.812
You're not planning on going to college?

14:20.814 --> 14:23.214
Well, my parents will
just buy my way into one,

14:23.216 --> 14:25.117
so it really doesn't matter what I do.

14:25.119 --> 14:27.585
It's not that anyone notices.

14:28.988 --> 14:31.255
Our lives are so totally different,

14:31.257 --> 14:33.624
but it's like we're in
the exact same place.

14:33.626 --> 14:35.960
In the hall, skipping the assembly?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.394
Yes, but...

14:37.396 --> 14:40.164
more the fact that
everyone just ignores us.

14:40.166 --> 14:42.432
Except my parents can't
afford to buy me in anywhere.

14:42.434 --> 14:45.869
So I won't go to college,
and nobody will really care.

14:45.871 --> 14:47.137
You must care.

14:47.139 --> 14:50.439
Eh. It'll be fine.

14:50.441 --> 14:51.941
I'll probably just...

14:51.943 --> 14:56.146
follow in my mother's
footsteps and marry some cop.

14:56.148 --> 14:58.247
I thought your parents hated each other.

14:58.249 --> 14:59.615
Don't everyone's?

14:59.617 --> 15:02.918
Good point.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.722
Being a cop's wife, it's not, um...

15:06.724 --> 15:09.291
it's not so bad.

15:09.293 --> 15:12.294
Mm. It's much warmer today
than I thought it would be.

15:12.296 --> 15:14.296
Yeah. Indian summer.

15:16.266 --> 15:17.599
You okay?

15:17.601 --> 15:19.600
Mm-hmm. I think it's too hot in here.

15:20.970 --> 15:22.670
I'm not feeling the best.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.105
You need me to take you home or something?

15:24.107 --> 15:25.606
No.

15:25.608 --> 15:28.474
I just think I need to get out of here.

15:28.476 --> 15:30.711
Okay.

15:30.713 --> 15:32.079
Feel better.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:02.674 --> 16:03.842
Where you going?

16:03.844 --> 16:06.044
To write.

16:06.046 --> 16:08.012
Do you mind if I use your typewriter?

16:08.014 --> 16:10.448
Does this mean you found
your topic for your essay?

16:10.450 --> 16:12.217
It does.

16:12.219 --> 16:13.351
Bye-bye, writer's block.

16:13.353 --> 16:15.052
Thanks to your advice,

16:15.054 --> 16:19.089
I found the topic that pushes
me most out of my safety zone...

16:19.091 --> 16:20.423
sex.

16:23.061 --> 16:25.495
What? What are you thinking?

16:25.497 --> 16:27.798
Nothing.

16:29.467 --> 16:32.468
I know that face.

16:32.470 --> 16:35.604
Just tell me.

16:35.606 --> 16:37.439
It's just that...

16:40.411 --> 16:42.578
I mean, sex is such a base topic.

16:43.914 --> 16:46.114
But look, you're so smart and funny

16:46.116 --> 16:47.916
and you're such a good writer.

16:47.918 --> 16:49.317
You don't need to go for the cheap score.

16:49.319 --> 16:51.853
"Cheap"?  You didn't.

16:51.855 --> 16:53.554
Come on. Sex is on par

16:53.556 --> 16:56.524
with... with fart jokes
and "page six" gossip.

16:56.526 --> 16:59.127
Well, I think fart jokes can be funny.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.229
And you know I love "page six."

17:01.231 --> 17:05.464
But... but, Carrie, it's just... you're better
than this, babe. Your writing is better than this.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.803
Well, not all of us are gonna win a Tony.

17:10.305 --> 17:12.940
Listen, write about sex if you want,

17:12.942 --> 17:14.441
but... but put it in that journal of yours.

17:14.443 --> 17:16.410
I know you've put a lot
of thoughts in there.

17:16.412 --> 17:19.179
But for a prestigious class? No.

17:19.181 --> 17:22.015
You said I should trust my instincts,

17:22.017 --> 17:24.550
but now you're telling me
my instincts are... are bad?

17:24.551 --> 17:27.752
Look, writing is... it's a long
process. It takes hard work.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.488
You shouldn't just go with the first idea

17:29.490 --> 17:31.157
that pops into your head.

17:31.159 --> 17:33.826
The history of trains was my first idea.

17:33.828 --> 17:36.528
This is my second idea.

17:36.530 --> 17:40.598
I really put a lot of thought into this.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.934
Hey. Don't be mad.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.202
I'm not mad.

17:43.204 --> 17:45.037
I just need to take my pill.

17:45.039 --> 17:48.207
I have to take it at
the same time every day.

17:48.209 --> 17:49.607
Carrie...

17:51.010 --> 17:52.844
Hey, this class is a major deal.

17:52.846 --> 17:55.346
All right, Professor Tenley
knows everyone in this business.

17:55.348 --> 17:57.048
Editors, publishers.

17:57.050 --> 17:59.583
So I'm telling you, if you
can make this essay amazing,

17:59.585 --> 18:01.252
it'll go a long way.

18:01.254 --> 18:05.356
If you mess it up, you're kind of done.

18:05.358 --> 18:08.258
Well, that's really harsh.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.260
I'm not trying to scare you.

18:10.262 --> 18:11.561
Well, you are,

18:11.563 --> 18:12.729
so thanks a lot.

18:12.731 --> 18:14.097
Look, I just wanna remind you

18:14.099 --> 18:15.798
that this essay could
be make-or-break.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.235
So you sure you want it to be about sex?

18:21.705 --> 18:24.773
Don't worry. I will help you brainstorm.

18:25.909 --> 18:28.543
While Weaver was making me feel insecure

18:28.545 --> 18:30.612
about my topic of sex,

18:31.314 --> 18:35.184
Maggie was facing the
consequences of unsafe sex.

18:35.186 --> 18:38.253
No.

18:39.455 --> 18:42.991
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:47.684 --> 18:49.552
Think Allen Ginsberg,

18:49.554 --> 18:51.253
Ayn Rand, John Howard Griffin.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.523
Think... think demons, despair, desolation.

18:54.525 --> 18:56.624
I'm thinking I need to take a walk.

18:56.626 --> 18:58.993
- Nope.
- No?

18:58.995 --> 19:00.395
No breaks at writer's boot camp.

19:00.397 --> 19:02.864
I just need, like, five minutes to myself

19:02.866 --> 19:04.599
and get some air.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.933
No, there's plenty of air in here.

19:05.935 --> 19:08.803
Procrastination time is over.
Now it's digging in time.

19:08.805 --> 19:10.739
But all you're doing is paralyzing me.

19:10.741 --> 19:12.406
My mind is mush.

19:12.408 --> 19:13.774
Then we have to keep turning those screws

19:13.776 --> 19:17.711
until your soul hurts and
an idea appears on the page.

19:17.713 --> 19:19.413
Hmm?

19:21.383 --> 19:24.017
Okay, now picture yourself at Walden Pond,

19:24.019 --> 19:25.252
building your own cabin...

19:25.254 --> 19:27.087
Weaver and I were in this together,

19:27.089 --> 19:29.088
when all I wanted was to be alone.

19:31.692 --> 19:35.194
Simon, not now.

19:35.196 --> 19:36.896
Well, then when?

19:36.898 --> 19:39.031
I don't have a lot of time.

19:39.033 --> 19:42.735
I need to tell you something. Um...

19:42.737 --> 19:45.604
I'm just gonna say it. I'm pregnant.

19:46.972 --> 19:49.941
Well, is it mine?

19:49.943 --> 19:51.042
How do you know?

19:51.044 --> 19:52.444
I took a test.

19:52.446 --> 19:54.379
I mean, how do you know that it's mine?

19:54.381 --> 19:57.649
I know because I haven't
been with anybody else.

20:00.285 --> 20:02.219
This was not supposed to happen.

20:02.221 --> 20:04.321
Listen, I know that I'm young,

20:04.323 --> 20:06.356
but under the circumstances,
I'm sure that my parents would

20:06.358 --> 20:07.625
give us permission to be together.

20:07.627 --> 20:08.826
We can work it out.

20:08.828 --> 20:10.260
Maggie, I'm engaged.

20:10.262 --> 20:12.663
But you're always saying
how much you care about me.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.567
I do.

20:17.569 --> 20:21.137
So... break it off with
her so we can be together.

20:21.139 --> 20:23.673
She's not pregnant with
your... your baby. I am.

20:23.675 --> 20:27.744
She's also never seen
the back of my squad car.

20:30.581 --> 20:32.213
Well, I'm sure that my
father would love to know

20:32.215 --> 20:33.816
that you feel that way about me.

20:37.587 --> 20:42.357
What I meant was that
you... knew what this was.

20:43.693 --> 20:46.695
A fun, secret fling, that's all.

20:46.697 --> 20:51.432
I mean, I know that you don't
want to have a baby right now,

20:51.434 --> 20:53.534
ruin the rest of your life.

20:53.536 --> 20:54.969
So what are you saying, that
I should get an abortion?

20:54.971 --> 20:56.703
'Cause I don't have 700 bucks. Do you?

20:57.872 --> 21:01.408
I share a bank account with
my fiancée. It would be hard.

21:03.446 --> 21:06.413
Wow.

21:06.415 --> 21:07.614
So I'm just on my own.

21:07.616 --> 21:10.217
I don't know what else to tell you.

21:11.785 --> 21:13.619
Thanks for the support.

21:25.863 --> 21:27.196
So do you think you have a decent grasp

21:27.198 --> 21:28.831
on the deal points for the Banes merger?

21:28.833 --> 21:30.266
Absolutely.

21:30.268 --> 21:32.068
Good, because I'm gonna have to
duck out of our business dinner

21:32.070 --> 21:34.670
a little early tomorrow night,
so you'll need to take over.

21:34.672 --> 21:36.738
Really? Something more important come up?

21:36.740 --> 21:38.307
Yep.

21:38.309 --> 21:40.042
I'm having a threesome.

21:43.180 --> 21:44.946
Uh, not at all what I expected to hear.

21:44.948 --> 21:47.648
- Really?
- What does one say? Uh, congrats?

21:47.650 --> 21:50.585
I'll take "you're the man!" Because I am.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.887
Uh, does Barbara put this
sort of thing in your planner?

21:52.889 --> 21:55.756
Of course. It's listed
under "client relations."

21:55.758 --> 21:57.525
Oh, please tell me it's
not with an actual client.

21:57.527 --> 22:00.627
What do you think, I have no integrity?

22:04.099 --> 22:06.233
I'm terrified of going
back to Bennet's place.

22:06.235 --> 22:08.102
It's like the seventh level of hell.

22:08.104 --> 22:09.470
You can hear gunshots.

22:09.472 --> 22:11.905
I know that area. It's the worst.

22:11.907 --> 22:13.840
Larissa scouted there for a photo shoot,

22:13.842 --> 22:15.241
and before they even got test shots,

22:15.243 --> 22:16.509
the camera was stolen.

22:16.511 --> 22:17.977
Well...

22:17.979 --> 22:19.245
I made plans with Bennet to
have dinner there this weekend

22:19.247 --> 22:21.147
and help put up his herb ritts photos.

22:21.149 --> 22:24.317
But I think I'm too afraid to go back.

22:24.319 --> 22:28.587
You just need to arm yourself
with mace or brass knuckles

22:28.589 --> 22:30.323
or nunchakus or something.

22:30.325 --> 22:32.690
Safety is the most important thing.

22:32.692 --> 22:33.925
Really, lady?

22:33.927 --> 22:36.328
Because I don't see you
taking your own advice.

22:36.330 --> 22:39.031
You need a version of mace, too,
and it's called a safety school.

22:39.033 --> 22:41.199
We're not talking about
me. We're talking about you.

22:41.201 --> 22:42.800
Well, everyone needs to feel safe.

22:42.802 --> 22:44.602
Unless, of course, you're a writer,

22:44.604 --> 22:48.072
in which case you have to
walk around tormented 24/7.

22:48.074 --> 22:50.074
At least you have an essay topic now.

22:50.076 --> 22:51.975
Nope. Weaver hated my idea.

22:51.977 --> 22:55.046
Yikes. That must've made you feel terrible.

22:55.048 --> 22:57.114
Yeah, at first.

22:57.116 --> 22:59.483
But I think it's gonna
be good in the long run.

22:59.485 --> 23:02.953
I mean, I've learned a
lot from him. It's intense.

23:02.955 --> 23:05.088
We're both writers, in
our heads all the time,

23:05.090 --> 23:06.523
just over-thinking.

23:06.525 --> 23:09.259
But, uh, we really get each other.

23:09.261 --> 23:11.327
And I've never been so
focused on my writing before.

23:11.329 --> 23:12.595
You know, I... I think he's bringing out

23:12.597 --> 23:13.963
the best version of me.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.666
Really? Because you seem really tense.

23:16.668 --> 23:17.934
Well, that's because
this version has no idea

23:17.936 --> 23:18.968
what she's going to write about,

23:18.970 --> 23:20.902
so she kind of sucks
and is totally panicked.

23:20.904 --> 23:22.304
And needs to figure it out immediately

23:22.306 --> 23:24.573
or she's gonna get an "F" on her essay

23:24.575 --> 23:26.875
and then fail the class and
then never work as a writer

23:26.877 --> 23:28.210
and then fall into a shame spiral

23:28.212 --> 23:30.245
and then end up living
homeless on Bennet's block.

23:30.247 --> 23:32.481
This version makes me feel anxious.

23:32.483 --> 23:33.482
Anxious is good.

23:33.484 --> 23:35.683
Anxious will help me write...

23:35.685 --> 23:37.918
I hope.

24:06.914 --> 24:08.880
Whoa.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.916
Oh. Sorry.

24:10.918 --> 24:14.220
I'll survive.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.522
What exactly are you doing in here?

24:16.524 --> 24:19.658
Uh, you mean besides throwing
paper balls at people?

24:19.660 --> 24:23.995
Let me guess. You're writing a
paper for Mr. Bramble's class?

24:23.997 --> 24:26.931
Actually, it's an essay
for this class I'm taking

24:26.933 --> 24:28.099
at the new school.

24:28.101 --> 24:30.635
You got in there? That's big.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.638
Yeah. I guess it is.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.608
So why do you seem so miserable?

24:38.010 --> 24:40.744
Uh... because it's really stressful.

24:40.746 --> 24:43.514
And this essay is just killing me.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.048
Oh, yeah? What's it about?

24:45.050 --> 24:47.717
I don't know yet, and that's the problem.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.386
I'm no expert at writing, but I do know

24:49.388 --> 24:52.122
you have a way of looking
at life like nobody else.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.790
That's what makes you so special.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.292
I'm not special.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.960
We both know that's not true.

24:59.229 --> 25:02.632
So stop worrying and just
write. You'll find it.

25:03.467 --> 25:04.867
Oh, and, Bradshaw,

25:04.869 --> 25:07.069
write something that makes you smile.

25:30.182 --> 25:31.983
I turned in my essay.

25:31.985 --> 25:33.784
- Really?
- Yep.

25:33.786 --> 25:36.154
I decided to write about sex.

25:41.995 --> 25:44.461
Looks like fall has finally arrived.

25:44.463 --> 25:46.363
Here.

25:46.365 --> 25:47.731
Take this.

25:47.733 --> 25:49.133
Thanks.

25:49.135 --> 25:51.035
I respect your decision.

25:51.037 --> 25:53.037
- You do?
- Yeah.

25:53.039 --> 25:55.172
Lots of people told me not to
write about my brother's death,

25:55.174 --> 25:57.374
but I did it anyway.

25:57.376 --> 25:58.908
And now I'm the "it" guy.

26:00.111 --> 26:01.210
I just hope I'm not a part

26:01.212 --> 26:02.545
of what makes talking
about sex scary for you.

26:02.547 --> 26:03.812
No, not at all.

26:03.814 --> 26:06.015
It's not about you. It's about me

26:06.017 --> 26:09.585
and all the weird details
I can't help but notice.

26:09.587 --> 26:11.254
Like what?

26:11.256 --> 26:12.788
Like...

26:12.790 --> 26:15.424
When we're having sex at your place...

26:15.426 --> 26:16.591
If the window is open,

26:16.593 --> 26:18.893
then the guy across the way can hear us.

26:18.895 --> 26:21.829
Which... I think he wants to hear us,

26:21.831 --> 26:23.365
which makes me not want him to hear us.

26:23.367 --> 26:25.833
So then we close the
window, but it gets too hot.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.635
So then we turn on the air conditioning,

26:27.637 --> 26:29.337
and there's this weird draft over your bed

26:29.339 --> 26:32.005
that hits one of my legs, and I get cold.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.507
So we open the window again,

26:33.509 --> 26:35.543
and we're right back where we started.

26:35.545 --> 26:39.880
Well, I... I had no idea
any of that was going on.

26:39.882 --> 26:41.182
Welcome to my mind.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.417
Oh, it's... it's very funny stuff.

26:43.419 --> 26:45.119
Thanks.

26:45.121 --> 26:46.319
I mean, it's not like

26:46.321 --> 26:48.921
I'm gonna make a living
off of it or anything.

26:48.923 --> 26:52.024
But I find it satisfying to write about.

26:52.026 --> 26:54.994
Having sex in a city with so
many people crammed together,

26:54.996 --> 26:57.863
it makes for some pretty
odd situations, I think.

26:57.865 --> 27:00.200
Seems like you've found your voice.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.202
And it's extremely clever. I'm
happy you didn't listen to me.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.603
Me too.

27:04.605 --> 27:08.073
I just wish you hadn't filled me
with so many doubts for a week.

27:08.075 --> 27:09.941
Oh come on, a week is nothing.

27:09.943 --> 27:11.577
Try years. And self-doubt,

27:11.579 --> 27:13.579
is a part the writing process.

27:13.581 --> 27:16.014
It makes a writer more interesting.

27:16.016 --> 27:18.583
Yeah. No, I... I get it.

27:18.585 --> 27:21.381
Being tortured is part
of being a good writer.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.613
But if you knew how much
I doutb myself already,

27:25.615 --> 27:27.558
you wouldn't have felt
the need to chime in.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.960
Babe, you... you just
need to constantly dig.

27:29.962 --> 27:31.596
You can't go too deep.

27:31.598 --> 27:33.331
But maybe I don't want my boyfriend to be

27:33.333 --> 27:36.666
the guy cranking the
rack in my head dungeon.

27:36.668 --> 27:39.236
Maybe I want my boyfriend to be the one

27:39.238 --> 27:42.439
who makes me feel safe and cocooned.

27:42.441 --> 27:45.942
Well, do you want to be comfortable,

27:45.944 --> 27:47.744
or be good?

27:47.746 --> 27:50.912
Can't... can't I be both?

27:50.914 --> 27:53.582
Not if you want to write
stuff that really matters.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.685
Suddenly, I realized
this itchy coat and Weaver

27:56.687 --> 27:58.420
were the same thing...

27:58.422 --> 28:01.490
they made me feel
uncomfortable in my own skin.

28:05.695 --> 28:07.028
Hey, you.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.631
Everything okay, Mags?

28:17.239 --> 28:20.207
While Walt was worried about his safety...

28:20.209 --> 28:22.842
So was Larissa.

28:25.414 --> 28:27.147
Meow.

28:28.384 --> 28:29.616
And another couple was
heading towards danger.

28:59.712 --> 29:04.615
Somehow we both keep
ending up together and alone

29:04.617 --> 29:05.683
at the same time.

29:05.685 --> 29:08.419
Somehow? You showed up at my house again.

29:10.489 --> 29:14.157
Maybe it's us against the world.

29:16.261 --> 29:18.328
I like the sound of "us."

29:23.535 --> 29:25.268
Here.

29:25.270 --> 29:27.237
I'm... I'm fine.

29:27.239 --> 29:29.372
Why don't you wear it? You're freezing.

29:29.374 --> 29:32.442
Because I... I would rather be cold

29:32.444 --> 29:34.943
than be in something
that doesn't feel right,

29:34.945 --> 29:37.646
and... and this doesn't feel right.

29:37.648 --> 29:40.315
Is "this" us?

29:42.619 --> 29:44.253
I don't know.

29:46.922 --> 29:50.424
Maybe it's because we're so similar,

29:50.426 --> 29:52.025
because we're both writers,

29:52.027 --> 29:54.194
because we think too much,

29:54.196 --> 29:56.530
because we're always doubting.

29:56.532 --> 29:58.165
I... I just...

29:58.167 --> 30:01.935
I don't want everything
to be so... uncomfortable.

30:01.937 --> 30:03.904
You don't want to really look at yourself,

30:03.906 --> 30:05.673
but that's what makes a good writer.

30:05.675 --> 30:08.174
I hear you.

30:08.176 --> 30:09.942
And I'm grateful that you taught me

30:09.944 --> 30:13.546
being unsafe is part
of being a good writer.

30:13.548 --> 30:17.384
But I don't think it's part of
being in a good relationship.

30:19.453 --> 30:22.388
What is a good relationship?

30:22.390 --> 30:23.922
Being with a guy who doesn't challenge you?

30:23.924 --> 30:27.493
No, but it's not being with
someone who relishes doing that.

30:27.495 --> 30:29.861
Okay, you... you can try
to blame all this on me,

30:29.863 --> 30:31.163
but our relationship never stood a chance

30:31.165 --> 30:33.632
since you never stopped
comparing it to your old one.

30:33.634 --> 30:36.268
And I... and I know exactly who the "he" is

30:36.270 --> 30:38.836
who makes you feel all cozy.

30:38.838 --> 30:39.970
What do you mean?

30:39.972 --> 30:41.339
Sebastian?

30:42.775 --> 30:44.676
I... I may have read more of your journal

30:44.678 --> 30:46.877
than I originally let on,

30:46.879 --> 30:49.747
and I saw his name in there a lot.

30:49.749 --> 30:53.318
Even when you mentioned me,
it was in comparison to him.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.921
I... I remember one line you wrote

30:57.923 --> 31:00.457
about how we weren't gonna see
each other for a whole week...

31:00.459 --> 31:04.928
"it's nice to finally miss someone new."

31:04.930 --> 31:07.263
Very poetic.

31:08.399 --> 31:11.834
But you were still referencing him.

31:13.269 --> 31:16.972
It... it was always really about him.

31:16.974 --> 31:20.008
But isn't that what people do?

31:20.010 --> 31:22.745
Compare their new relationships
to their past ones?

31:22.747 --> 31:24.447
I guess,

31:24.449 --> 31:25.648
but you're supposed to feel like

31:25.650 --> 31:28.350
the new relationship you're in is better.

31:32.421 --> 31:34.389
You obviously don't.

31:50.633 --> 31:52.400
This shouldn't be happening.

31:52.402 --> 31:53.969
Why not?

31:53.971 --> 31:56.169
C... Carrie's with someone
else. What do you care?

31:56.171 --> 31:58.772
Carrie doesn't even care-rie about you.

31:58.774 --> 32:00.340
I mean, care.

32:00.342 --> 32:01.976
Carrie.

32:01.978 --> 32:03.611
This isn't about Carrie.

32:03.613 --> 32:05.946
So what's it about?

32:05.948 --> 32:08.015
You're a mess, Mags.

32:08.017 --> 32:10.150
And even forgetting about Carrie

32:10.152 --> 32:11.451
and all the screwed up history we have,

32:11.453 --> 32:12.752
I would never take advantage

32:12.754 --> 32:14.654
of any girl who is clearly this drunk.

32:14.656 --> 32:17.056
I'm not... I'm not that drunk.

32:17.058 --> 32:19.626
What's going on with you, Maggie?

32:19.628 --> 32:21.728
Nothing.

32:21.730 --> 32:23.462
What do you mean?

32:23.464 --> 32:25.464
You're obviously going through something.

32:25.466 --> 32:29.267
And you showed up here. So
just tell me. What is it?

32:33.039 --> 32:34.540
I'm...

32:36.108 --> 32:37.709
I'm pregnant.

32:39.078 --> 32:41.647
I didn't plan on jumping
you. I... I just couldn't...

32:41.649 --> 32:44.549
take another minute just
freaking out about myself.

32:44.551 --> 32:47.084
I have no one.

32:47.086 --> 32:51.989
I... I... I have no money,
and Simon won't help me.

32:51.991 --> 32:53.858
Well, how... how do you
know? Did you talk to him?

32:53.860 --> 32:55.993
Yes. He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

32:55.995 --> 32:58.696
How am I gonna... how am
I gonna tell my parents?

32:58.698 --> 33:00.597
My dad is gonna kill me.

33:02.299 --> 33:04.601
What am I gonna do?

33:05.770 --> 33:08.738
Uh, you're gonna stay here
tonight and sleep this off.

33:08.740 --> 33:12.508
When you wake up, we'll figure
out what your choices are...

33:12.510 --> 33:14.310
together.

33:22.053 --> 33:23.385
Look. I'm almost done.

33:23.387 --> 33:26.589
Wow. I'm impressed.

33:26.591 --> 33:28.057
But I...

33:28.059 --> 33:30.392
I thought you were gonna
be in the city tonight.

33:30.394 --> 33:32.560
Um, I was,

33:32.562 --> 33:35.529
but it got too cold, so
I decided to come home.

33:35.531 --> 33:37.699
All right. Well, it's nice
to see you here for a change.

33:37.701 --> 33:39.300
Mm.

33:39.302 --> 33:40.567
So what are the piles?

33:40.569 --> 33:42.335
Uh, these are Mouse's shirts,

33:42.337 --> 33:44.270
that's my donating pile, and that's

33:44.272 --> 33:46.573
my "burn because I'm
embarrassed I ever wore it" pile.

33:46.575 --> 33:49.042
What's this pile?

33:49.044 --> 33:52.345
Uh, that's my "I haven't decided yet" pile.

33:53.447 --> 33:54.815
Okay.

33:56.483 --> 33:58.383
Hey, um...

33:58.385 --> 34:01.020
don't throw everything
away. You might regret it.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.888
I once saw your mom actually buying back

34:02.890 --> 34:05.124
some of the stuff that she had donated.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.325
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:06.327 --> 34:07.727
You know what?

34:07.729 --> 34:09.061
It doesn't hurt to hang on
to some things from your past.

34:09.063 --> 34:10.795
You might not think much of 'em now,

34:10.797 --> 34:13.998
but maybe someday you might want them back.

34:16.368 --> 34:18.569
Sometimes you are very wise.

34:18.571 --> 34:20.804
Tell that to Dorrit.

34:20.806 --> 34:23.507
Hey, dad, do you mind if
I borrow your car tonight?

34:23.510 --> 34:26.476
Sure. Yeah. Um, keys are downstairs.

34:36.420 --> 34:39.690
It's scary putting on something
you never want to take off,

34:39.692 --> 34:43.793
but sometimes you have to
play with fire to stay warm.

34:45.094 --> 34:47.996
I still don't understand
how you did this to yourself.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.632
All right, since when do you carry mace?

34:49.634 --> 34:51.266
Since you moved here.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.601
Really?

34:53.603 --> 34:55.938
This neighborhood scares
the hell out of me.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.641
So I bought mace for protection.

34:58.643 --> 35:02.210
And then I was way too on
edge to even use it properly.

35:02.212 --> 35:04.980
Oh, my God. That is the
sweetest thing I've ever heard.

35:04.982 --> 35:06.214
You came back over here even though

35:06.216 --> 35:07.949
you were that scared for your life?

35:07.951 --> 35:09.651
Yeah.

35:09.653 --> 35:12.253
But turns out, I'm my own worst enemy.

35:12.255 --> 35:14.222
Well, I don't want you to be scared ever.

35:14.224 --> 35:15.657
You don't have to come back here.

35:15.659 --> 35:17.324
We'll figure something out.

35:19.061 --> 35:21.361
You know what? I'm not afraid anymore.

35:21.363 --> 35:23.030
You're not?

35:23.032 --> 35:25.365
I mean, out there is a horror show.

35:25.367 --> 35:27.702
But in here,

35:27.704 --> 35:30.537
I've never felt safer.

35:30.539 --> 35:32.371
And to feel this...

35:34.408 --> 35:37.410
I want to come back,

35:37.412 --> 35:39.045
again and again,

35:39.047 --> 35:40.914
because I love you.

35:40.916 --> 35:43.683
Walt.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.018
I love you, too.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.889
And I promise next time I'll get
you a gypsy cab to come here...

35:50.891 --> 35:52.591
if any of them even will.

35:52.593 --> 35:54.459
Yeah.

35:54.461 --> 35:56.995
Here. Let me get this right here.

36:01.268 --> 36:03.168
I can't believe it.

36:03.170 --> 36:05.669
Harlan is still, like, an hour away,

36:05.671 --> 36:07.105
stuck in traffic in the tunnel.

36:07.107 --> 36:08.806
Ah! And if you're gonna make a joke

36:08.808 --> 36:10.942
about him being stuck in a tunnel,

36:10.944 --> 36:13.144
don't.

36:13.146 --> 36:16.580
But what a waste of a perfectly
good pair of handcuffs.

36:16.582 --> 36:19.316
Ugh. Forget the handcuffs.
What about my rose petals?

36:20.552 --> 36:21.752
It's probably for the best.

36:23.088 --> 36:25.088
You wouldn't have been able to handle me.

36:25.090 --> 36:26.356
Excuse me?

36:26.358 --> 36:28.859
You think I can't handle you?

36:28.861 --> 36:30.360
I've done a green door special...

36:30.362 --> 36:31.527
twice.

36:31.529 --> 36:32.829
Big deal.

36:32.831 --> 36:35.998
Try it in a hot tub... with
a pro basketball player.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.600
You lowlife slag.

36:38.602 --> 36:40.269
Pretentious bitch.

36:41.639 --> 36:44.840
Larissa and Samantha tried
to outdo each other...

36:49.113 --> 36:51.147
While doing each other.

36:51.149 --> 36:52.346
Wait!

36:52.348 --> 36:54.149
Won't Harlan mind us
doing this without him?

36:54.151 --> 36:55.683
Yeah. Good point.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.625
Okay.

37:04.627 --> 37:05.994
Now this way,

37:05.996 --> 37:08.728
he'll get to keep the memories forever.

37:33.787 --> 37:36.923
Suddenly, I had no cocoon at all.

37:39.492 --> 37:42.027
And I had never felt less safe.

38:14.093 --> 38:16.927
I don't know how either of
them can live with themselves.

38:16.929 --> 38:19.895
Sebastian and Maggie
aren't doing anything wrong.

38:19.897 --> 38:22.531
I've practically been
ignoring them both for months.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.034
What did I think was gonna happen?

38:25.036 --> 38:30.106
They both moved on, and
I guess I should've, too,

38:30.108 --> 38:31.874
but I just couldn't.

38:31.876 --> 38:34.109
Are you regretting breaking up with Weaver?

38:34.111 --> 38:35.510
No.

38:35.512 --> 38:37.446
I mean, self-doubt might help my writing,

38:37.448 --> 38:39.014
but it doesn't help my living.

38:39.016 --> 38:42.317
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

38:42.319 --> 38:45.887
I'm happy I took the
leap towards Sebastian,

38:45.889 --> 38:48.756
even if my heart is in a million pieces.

38:48.758 --> 38:51.392
Just because you want something
doesn't mean you get it.

38:51.394 --> 38:53.627
That was directed at me, right?

38:53.629 --> 38:55.829
Because I won't choose a safety school.

38:55.831 --> 38:57.264
What?

38:57.266 --> 38:59.833
You're right.

38:59.835 --> 39:01.202
I'm an idiot.

39:01.204 --> 39:03.371
I didn't see that coming.

39:03.373 --> 39:05.605
That's because I'm never an idiot.

39:08.309 --> 39:11.511
I'm going to apply to a safety school.

39:11.513 --> 39:14.280
I'll get an application for N.Y.U.

39:14.282 --> 39:17.917
Hey! That's my first choice!

39:26.792 --> 39:29.128
Hey. How you feelin'?

39:29.130 --> 39:31.263
Awful.

39:32.765 --> 39:35.100
Embarrassed.

39:35.102 --> 39:36.468
Awful.

39:39.905 --> 39:41.772
Thanks.

39:44.743 --> 39:45.943
Listen to me.

39:45.945 --> 39:50.614
Whatever you decide to
do, I'll be here for you.

39:50.616 --> 39:52.350
I'll help however I can.

39:52.352 --> 39:53.816
Why?

39:53.818 --> 39:55.718
Because we're friends,

39:55.720 --> 39:57.987
and friends take care of each other.

39:57.989 --> 40:00.524
Thank you.

40:00.526 --> 40:02.426
Mm. So much.

40:04.328 --> 40:07.964
But won't helping me
possibly hurt your chances

40:07.966 --> 40:09.432
of getting Carrie back?

40:14.271 --> 40:17.039
I don't think it'll matter anymore.

40:21.379 --> 40:23.579
There's no way we're
gonna finish those bagels.

40:23.581 --> 40:25.480
They're enormous.

40:25.482 --> 40:27.048
I have an idea.

40:27.050 --> 40:29.016
Excuse me, sir?

40:29.018 --> 40:31.386
Would you like a bagel?

40:34.390 --> 40:36.191
I don't like cream cheese!

40:39.828 --> 40:40.962
Well, that happened.

40:42.998 --> 40:44.664
I can't bel... I don't even want to look.

40:44.666 --> 40:46.233
It's all over. Don't look. It... no.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.469
It's all over your...  sweater.

40:54.109 --> 40:58.244
As children, we are taught
not to talk to strangers,

40:58.246 --> 41:00.179
not to run into the street,

41:00.181 --> 41:02.047
not to play with fire.

41:02.049 --> 41:03.682
But as we get older,

41:03.684 --> 41:06.518
always staying safe can
prevent us from experiencing

41:06.520 --> 41:08.253
all of what life has to offer.

41:09.990 --> 41:11.256
If you never take risks,

41:11.258 --> 41:12.857
you don't really get a
chance to live at all.

41:14.595 --> 41:15.693
And what's the fun in that?

41:17.264 --> 41:19.431
In love, you want to feel safe.

41:19.433 --> 41:20.898
You should feel safe.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.065
But as a writer,

41:22.067 --> 41:23.934
you're supposed to run towards the danger

41:23.936 --> 41:25.035
instead of away from it.

41:30.075 --> 41:32.543
You're also supposed
to write what you know.

41:35.314 --> 41:37.780
and even though I'd gotten
a pretty good grade...

41:39.151 --> 41:42.118
I didn't know enough about
sex or love or this city

41:42.120 --> 41:44.920
to ever write about any of them...

41:44.922 --> 41:46.256
ever again.
