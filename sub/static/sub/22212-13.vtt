00:08.258 --> 00:09.426
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.509 --> 00:10.802
Isn't this what
the Serpents would do?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.887
-Cause some chaos.

00:12.971 --> 00:17.017
-Hiram Lodge asked you to start a mutiny.
-It's an eviction notice.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.604
My intuition told me Sheriff Keller was
having an affair with Mayor McCoy.

00:21.688 --> 00:26.151
I have some out-of-town guests coming in.
I'm hosting a poker game at Pop's.

00:26.234 --> 00:31.031
Poppa Poutine was found dead in his
hotel room, shot in the back of the head.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.199
Good night, Chic. You're safe here.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.619
-He has to go.
-I threw you out once, I'll do it again.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.288
I want all of you tonight.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.707
Is Chic home?

00:41.583 --> 00:42.542
Mom?

00:45.795 --> 00:48.673
-No, no, no. Don't come closer.

00:48.757 --> 00:53.386
Don't touch anything. He tried to hurt me,
and Chic, your brother...

00:55.346 --> 00:56.973
-I'm calling the police.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.268
-No. Don't do that.
-Mom, there's a man on our floor.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.980
The police will take Chic away.
I won't let that happen again.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.899
Well, if it was self-defense--

01:06.483 --> 01:09.027
-Yes, it was.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.572
-But it won't matter.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.283
-Go to your room. You didn't see anything.
-Mom, let me help you.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.285
No,
it's better if you're not involved.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.539
-It's Dad.
-Don't answer.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.958
-Yes, you're right. Answer.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.960
Just act like everything's normal.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.798
Hi, Dad, what's up?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.846
-Okay, see you in a bit.
-Please tell me he's not coming here.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.682
He needs toiletries,
but doesn't wanna get in a fight with you.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.852
-Betty--
-Mom, we don't know how much time we have.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.731
-Please, just let me help you.
<i>And in one reckless moment...</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:49.901
Bleach is under the sink.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.280
<i>...the lives of the Cooper women</i>
<i>were forever changed.</i>

01:54.364 --> 01:57.117
<i>They were a mother</i>
<i>wanting to protect her son,</i>

01:57.200 --> 02:00.078
<i>and a daughter</i>
<i>wanting to protect her mother.</i> <i>-While less than 50 yards away...</i>
-Once more,

02:03.123 --> 02:09.462
you didn't see or hear Hiram Lodge
say anything to or about Poppa Poutine?

02:09.546 --> 02:12.298
Honestly, it seemed like--

02:12.382 --> 02:15.927
-Like they were friends.
-A friend, Archie, doesn't force you

02:16.010 --> 02:19.305
down to your knees
and shoot you with a Glock 34.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.892
It wasn't Mr. Lodge.
I didn't see him leave The Pembrooke.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.312
-Hiram would've sent someone. His capo.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.404
-If you woke up my dad--
-A capo, Archie, does the boss's dirty work, the killing.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.869
Is there someone who's always hovering
around Hiram?

02:40.952 --> 02:43.788
Like a personal assistant or driver?

02:47.458 --> 02:49.168
Not that I can think of.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.171
<i>Hello</i>

03:07.604 --> 03:08.438
Betty.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.857
-Alice.
-Hal.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.610
-Dad.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.862
Upstairs in his room, resting.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.658
Bleach. I spilled tomato soup.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.535
I didn't want it to stain.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.080
It must've been a lot,
because it smells like a hospital here.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.458
Do you want me to get the toiletries?

03:52.732 --> 03:53.775
Jug, what's up?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.527
Nothing, I was just calling
to say good night.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.363
And, uh...

04:00.031 --> 04:00.865
I love you.

04:01.699 --> 04:06.120
Your dad's gone. Hurry up.
-Jug, uh, I gotta go. See you tomorrow.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.254
-People go missing every day.

04:14.337 --> 04:18.007
-He didn't strike me as the type.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.260
Who walks around without a wallet?

04:30.019 --> 04:32.647
They shut down these sewer pipes
decades ago.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.860
This used to be my secret place
as a little girl.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.738
Here, cover it up.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.994
<i>They were hiding something.</i>
-Oh, Harold,

04:46.077 --> 04:50.415
-everyone's always hiding something.
-The house smelled of bleach.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
And you didn't see Chic?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.461
Maybe he was up in his room.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.505
Entertaining.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.842
Tall Boy won't be coming back
any time soon.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.303
Good. He was a coward.

05:05.305 --> 05:10.351
I was thinking maybe I should take a page
from your book, sit-down with McCoy.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.646
Now that we know Hiram Lodge
is responsible the statue,

05:13.730 --> 05:17.483
I say we show her the head,
appeal to her sense of justice.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.862
What

05:26.159 --> 05:26.993
Wait a second.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.038
Boy, where the hell
is General Pickens' head?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.459
I don't think we can interpret
the delivery of that head

05:34.542 --> 05:36.836
as anything less
than a declaration of war.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.922
Well, we knew we would have to go
to war eventually.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.633
There is, of course, another option.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.513
At Spence, I was secretary-general
of the Model UN.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.933
Before declaring war,
we'd try to negotiate a settlement.

05:51.017 --> 05:56.230
Now, if I could broker a dÃ©tente
between the contras and the Sandinistas,

05:56.314 --> 05:59.108
you should be able to de-escalate
relations with a biker gang.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.485
This isn't high school.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.654
Said the man who just vandalized
a park statue.

06:06.574 --> 06:10.328
You're an excellent businessman, Daddy.
I'll get them to the table.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.580
All you have to do is play nice.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.881
We have work to do.
Clean anything he may have touched

06:21.964 --> 06:23.674
so there are no fingerprints.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.313
Mom, did he touch any of these?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.023
No.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.409
-Mom.
-Oh, good, you're up. Have a seat.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.872
I don't like chocolate chip pancakes.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.292
Well, at least have some cereal.
You must be starving.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.465
Thank you.
Oh, can I have the butter, please?

08:07.153 --> 08:07.987
Elizabeth.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.374
Ask who it is.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.001
Who is it?

08:32.678 --> 08:33.513
Good morning.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.851
Just thought I could walk you to school.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.533
Hey, can I talk to you about last night?

08:55.618 --> 08:59.914
-I thought we had a really nice night,

08:59.997 --> 09:03.125
and then you hung up on me,
so I kind of got nervous.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.753
Maybe you thought
we were moving too fast...
-Oh, my God.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.427
-No. No, not at all.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.639
Last night was amazing.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.102
There was just a lot of drama
when I got home.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.772
Let me guess, Chic

09:27.149 --> 09:28.192
It'll be fine.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.113
Just typical Cooper house lunacy.

09:32.196 --> 09:37.326
So, Archiekins, do you regret anything
we talked about at my confirmation?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.831
The revelation that my father's
more Al Capone than Eliot Ness?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.001
No. All good on my end.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.878
In that case...

09:47.962 --> 09:51.632
just to put it on your radar,
a low-key turf war might be brewing

09:51.716 --> 09:53.718
between the Joneses and the Lodges.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.471
-Define manage.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.348
People will lose their homes.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.810
Why don't you come with your dad
and sit down with my dad,

10:02.893 --> 10:05.313
and hash this out like civilized humans?

10:05.896 --> 10:06.731
Okay.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.818
One condition. Your dad comes
to Sunnyside Trailer Park.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.237
I want him to see the people
he'll displace.

10:13.321 --> 10:17.533
Fine. And trust me,
no one is being displaced.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.620
My God. Did you hear?
My dad's scanner's blowing up.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.248
The police found another dead body.
There's blood everywhere.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.627
Could the Black Hood have risen
from the grave?

10:29.795 --> 10:34.508
The investigation's ongoing, but it was
a gruesome execution at the motel.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.511
Blood and brains splattered
all over the duvet.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.971
Okay, Kev, we get it.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.390
I gotta go.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.992
Oh. Betty, are you okay?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.370
-I'm fine, Cheryl.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.039
-Let me grab you a towel.
-I said, I'm fine.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.918
You have puke on your collar.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.262
A bullet to the head?
That is clearly a mafioso's doing.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.057
No sooner do I feel
like I'm in a good place,

11:23.140 --> 11:26.352
some terrible thing happens,
and somebody dies,

11:26.435 --> 11:29.980
and I'm back in the place of,
"What if my father's behind this?"

11:30.064 --> 11:32.483
Making matters worse,
I've now dragged you

11:32.566 --> 11:37.196
-into this Martin Scorsese nightmare.
-I chose to be with you. To help you.

11:37.279 --> 11:41.409
-Archie, I can't handle the not knowing--
-Choose to believe in your dad.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.788
His business dealings might be shady,
but at heart, he's still a good guy.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.249
-I know that. You know that.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.254
Come here.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.846
Riddle me this.
What do Sunnyside Trailer Park,

12:01.929 --> 12:05.182
Twilight Drive-In and Southside High
all have in common?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.936
I'm sure I don't know.

12:09.019 --> 12:12.356
They all were or are town land.
You control them.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.443
The drive-in was shut down.

12:15.526 --> 12:19.155
As was Southside High.
Now the trailer park is in jeopardy?

12:19.238 --> 12:22.616
Can't you feel the invisible hand
of Hiram Lodge over this?

12:23.367 --> 12:28.205
What exactly are you insinuating?

12:28.789 --> 12:31.542
If you've been accepting donations
from the Lodges

12:31.625 --> 12:34.587
in exchange for favors,
such as land deals...

12:35.754 --> 12:38.757
now's your chance to come clean
to the public.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.056
A bribe?
-Payment.

12:47.057 --> 12:51.520
The FBI always compensates its informants.
Enclosed is three weeks' salary.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.107
Great. Now I can replace
the bass drum you trashed. I'm hoping that payment will entice you
to go to Hiram Lodge

12:58.777 --> 13:02.323
and engage with him directly
about Poppa Poutine.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.534
Be aggressive, gauge his reaction,
see what he says.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.704
If I ask him anything about it,
he'll be suspicious.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.170
Come on.
How many people have to get hurt or die

13:16.253 --> 13:18.255
before you do something about it?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.177
<i>-Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Lodge.</i>
-Yeah, of course, Archie.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.932
The article in the <i>Register</i>
about Poppa Poutine in his room--

13:28.015 --> 13:29.266
Archie, if I may.

13:32.144 --> 13:37.733
I am gutted over this atrocity,
but Poutine was rich with enemies.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.486
He was rude and selfish...

13:41.904 --> 13:44.031
and deep into gambling debts.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.826
A quarter to Lenny alone,
not to mention the affairs.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.497
With so many vendettas against him,
it was just a matter of time.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.125
And his time came the same night
as my daughter's confirmation.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.836
Since you brought up
Veronica's confirmation,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.340
-she's the reason I came to see you.
Is she all right?

14:01.924 --> 14:05.678
When she heard someone was murdered
in Riverdale, the thought of you

14:05.761 --> 14:09.056
maybe possibly being involved
is making her spiral.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.016
And I don't wanna overstep...

14:12.351 --> 14:15.312
but you may wanna clarify things
with your daughter

14:15.396 --> 14:17.273
just to give her peace of mind.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.676
Honey, perfect timing.
We're about to have dinner.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.054
I'm not hungry. I have a ton of homework.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.822
-Hey, Veronica.
-Hi, Daddy.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
Ready for your big negotiation?

16:32.700 --> 16:36.578
I am, but first, Archie came by to see me.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.081
He said you were concerned.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.625
-Daddy--
-No, no. It's all right.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.670
I'm glad he did. He cares about you.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.590
As do I.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.387
I understand certain aspects
of my business trouble you.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.932
So, if there's something you wanna know--

16:57.016 --> 17:00.144
Did you have anything to do
with Poppa Poutine's death?

17:03.564 --> 17:04.398
No, <i>mija.</i>

17:05.899 --> 17:06.775
I did not.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.123
You lied to us. That shady guy
wasn't one of your customers.

17:21.206 --> 17:24.043
He was a drug dealer. It's all in here.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.129
Hundreds of messages from junkies
looking for a fix.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.216
-Including one from Chic the night of--

17:31.300 --> 17:34.845
To make sure
that no one could see him from the trail.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.639
Give that to me
before someone tracks it here.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.560
No, I turned off the GPS.
And you're missing the point here, okay?

17:41.643 --> 17:45.481
Chic lied about the shady guy.
What else is he lying about, huh?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.944
Excuse me

17:51.028 --> 17:54.990
-No one is buying the waterworks.
-That's enough, Elizabeth.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.868
Keep this up, you'll get us caught.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.538
He's the one who will get us caught
by not telling us everything.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.500
That the person in the sewer pipe
was a drug dealer?

18:04.583 --> 18:07.211
Frankly, I'm relieved.
A transient like that?

18:07.294 --> 18:11.256
-It means no one is looking for him.
-Um, I hate to break it to you,

18:11.340 --> 18:15.094
-but drug dealers have families.
-What's done is done, Elizabeth.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.222
The family you should be worried about
is your own.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.977
I asked him, point-blank.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.525
I said, "Mr. Lodge, did you kill
or hire anyone to kill Poppa Poutine?"

18:29.608 --> 18:31.527
-And he said no.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.237
I did, yeah.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.155
I do.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.873
Mr. Lodge did tell me there was bad blood
between Poppa Poutine

18:44.957 --> 18:47.793
-and some other guy named Lenny.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.673
Yeah. I guess Poutine owed him
a lot of money.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.261
Eighty-six thousand dollars
in gambling debt or something.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.595
Lenny Kowalski.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.723
Let me look into it.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.480
Thank you for agreeing
to discuss this misunderstanding.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.566
-There's no mis--
-There's no misunderstanding here.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.653
Tall Boy said you paid him
to decapitate the Pickens statue.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.447
As an excuse to turn up the heat
on the Serpents.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.284
We got people scared
they'll lose their home.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.743
I heard about that.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.205
Though it has nothing to do with me,
I spoke to Mayor McCoy.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.375
As a gesture of good will
to the Southside community,

19:28.458 --> 19:32.337
I'd like to settle any back rent you
or your neighbors owe the town.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.050
-Peace in the land.

19:37.634 --> 19:38.510
Hmm.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.683
It's a deal.

19:47.394 --> 19:52.107
There's one thing. Mayor McCoy tells me
there's some exposÃ© you're working on.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.278
In exchange for my offer, I'd appreciate
it if you kept my name out of it.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.446
Sound fair?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.743
-That sounds a lot like a bribe.
-Heh.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.870
-No deal.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.372
See you in the funny pages.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.815
I just saw Hal Cooper
leaving Thistlehouse.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.778
Betty was sick to her stomach
at school yesterday, Mother.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.947
What if it was over this?

20:40.739 --> 20:43.867
You're destroying families
with your courtesan ways.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.163
It's different with Hal.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.540
He's not a client.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.252
It's real.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.797
Mother, he has a wife.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.798
Alice Cooper?

20:58.924 --> 20:59.841
That gorgon?

21:00.884 --> 21:03.011
She's not the victim here.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.764
So, please, Cheryl, stay out of it.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
Absolutely not!
You are part of that.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.232
No, I am not.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.150
You're letting a school get in the way--

21:17.234 --> 21:19.611
I'm not doing this anymore. This is crazy.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.114
I am this close
to telling that Jones boy everything,

21:22.197 --> 21:24.408
and it'll be worse for you than for me.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.659
Mayor McCoy.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.079
Wait, what just happened?

21:29.162 --> 21:31.957
Given the hatchet job
Jughead is writing about us,

21:32.541 --> 21:35.252
we feel it's best
to accelerate our timetable.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.922
Yes, we told Sierra we might have
to announce our plans for Southside High.

21:39.006 --> 21:43.927
Typical Sierra, she refused and demanded
that we wait until after she's re-elected.

21:44.011 --> 21:47.222
She's threatening to expose us
if we proceed without her.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.183
If this isn't handled properly,
the whole town will be out for our blood.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.270
If we get her out of office
under a cloud of scandal,

21:53.353 --> 21:55.063
the damage she could do to us
would be minimized.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.233
How would you do that?
-I had Andre follow her.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.237
And let's just say she spends
an awful lot of time in cheap motels.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.410
It's time for Operation:
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.460
Hey, Vegas. Hey, boy. Hey.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.642
-Hey, Arch. Uh, this is--

22:33.226 --> 22:37.731
Agent Adams. Nice to meet you.
Your father and I were just finishing up.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.080
<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi. I found this phone in a parking lot.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.457
-I was wondering if you knew--

23:03.090 --> 23:05.467
<i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.887
I think someone lost this phone.
I was wondering if you knew--

23:20.065 --> 23:22.442
Uh...
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

23:22.526 --> 23:24.653
-I found this phone.
<i>-Cut the crap.</i>

23:24.736 --> 23:28.615
<i>You're the slut he's been whoring with.</i>
<i>You're why he's been missing.</i>

23:28.698 --> 23:32.160
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Tell that scumbag not to come home.</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:33.203
<i>He's dead to me.</i>

23:48.718 --> 23:49.553
Betty.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.889
Yeah, I'll be right there.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.436
Betty.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.190
What's going on?
What are you doing out here?

24:04.109 --> 24:07.028
I think I'm going crazy, Jug.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.449
My mom's acting like everything's normal,
when... it's not.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.579
Everything is falling apart.
Everything is falling apart.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.544
I need to tell you something.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.051
-I can't eat, I can't sleep.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.013
I'm just obsessing over this shady man.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.015
His phone and his life.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.810
Meanwhile, my mom's acting
like it never happened.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.606
-You still can, Betty.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.901
-And you know you probably should.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.493
Hey, either of you know
the owner of that car?

24:58.288 --> 25:01.374
Been there since day before yesterday.
Neighbor complained.

25:06.963 --> 25:10.634
Yeah, sorry, officer. That's my car.
I just can't find my keys.

25:10.717 --> 25:14.262
Street's being cleaned tomorrow a.m.
I'm going around the block.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.349
If it's still there in five minutes,
you get a ticket.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.564
How fast can you hotwire a car?

25:30.820 --> 25:34.282
-That agent left.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.535
Apparently, the FBI is assisting
in a crackdown

25:37.619 --> 25:42.290
on undocumented labor from Canada.
They think that maybe, over the years,

25:42.374 --> 25:45.710
I've hired some of these guys,
paid them cash under the table.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.296
A couple times,
I looked the other way.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.842
-But they can't take you down for that.
-Sure they can. Son, it's the FBI.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.012
They're requesting my files
for the last seven years.

26:00.475 --> 26:03.853
Agent Adams,
you stay the hell away from my dad.

26:03.937 --> 26:08.608
Scary, isn't it? How quickly I can make
things difficult for you and your father?

26:08.692 --> 26:11.736
You said he'd be protected.
You gave me a contract.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.654
Archie.

26:14.114 --> 26:18.576
Poutine did not owe
Lenny Kowalski anything close to $86,000.

26:19.452 --> 26:23.873
You're feeding me false information
because you're protecting Hiram Lodge,

26:23.957 --> 26:25.834
which means you're compromised.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.462
Basically, the only thing
you can offer me now is access.

26:30.088 --> 26:33.258
So, I need you to wake up,
stop dicking around,

26:33.341 --> 26:36.303
and plant a bug in Hiram's office.

26:36.386 --> 26:40.390
Then he'll slip up,
and say something incriminating,

26:40.473 --> 26:42.851
and I'll record it and arrest him.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.104
A nice, happy ending.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.607
You and your father will be safe.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.664
I don't believe you'll leave us alone.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.126
I think you'll do anything you can
to destroy Hiram Lodge,

27:08.710 --> 27:13.006
-even if it means destroying us.
-Make sure it doesn't come to that.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.893
Back so soon, Mr. Cooper?

27:28.271 --> 27:32.692
Cheryl. What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

27:32.776 --> 27:35.904
You do know my mother's a harlot,
don't you?

27:36.654 --> 27:38.573
A modern

27:40.784 --> 27:43.328
What you're doing
could destroy your family.

27:44.371 --> 27:48.124
That's why I'm not going to tell Betty.
But I suggest you hurry home

27:48.208 --> 27:50.960
to your wife and daughter
before I change my mind.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.590
I came to warn you,
Mayor McCoy.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.928
I know that whatever
questionable arrangement you have

28:00.011 --> 28:01.805
with my parents is imploding,

28:01.888 --> 28:05.600
and that you're trying to go after them
in some way,

28:05.683 --> 28:09.437
but, Mayor McCoy,
they're planning to discredit you.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.858
To get you out of this office
and neutralize you.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.153
Whatever bomb they can set off
will only burn them, too.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.117
They know about the affair.

28:22.742 --> 28:27.205
Your... relationship with Sheriff Keller.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.128
But, Mayor McCoy, you can get out of this.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.881
Take control of the narrative.
Inoculate yourself.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.095
How long do I have?

28:46.725 --> 28:49.811
Norman Bates
made it look so easy.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.443
His phone, too.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.863
-Betty, his phone.
-Oh.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.549
As mayor, I have seen us
through a triumphant Jubilee

30:02.133 --> 30:04.552
and the terrors of the Black Hood killer,

30:05.053 --> 30:08.681
but, my friends,
it has taken a personal toll.

30:09.265 --> 30:13.686
<i>I have decided to step down as mayor</i>
<i>to spend more time with my family,</i>

30:14.062 --> 30:17.607
<i>and to return to my own legal career</i>
<i>right here in Riverdale.</i>

30:18.191 --> 30:20.610
-Mayor McCoy is resigning.

30:20.944 --> 30:25.198
-We haven't even made our play yet.
-That's great. Now you don't have to.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.118
If you did, it would be cruel.

30:30.161 --> 30:36.042
<i>It has always been my intention to do</i>
<i>what is best for the people of Riverdale.</i>

30:36.125 --> 30:40.672
I have to say, Veronica, for Mayor McCoy
to resign like that, out of the blue,

30:41.506 --> 30:44.133
it's almost as if someone warned her.

30:49.514 --> 30:53.226
Did you tell Mayor McCoy we were planning
to expose her affair?

30:55.186 --> 30:58.106
No... I did not.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.235
Hmm.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.621
Oh. Hal. Alice and Betty
aren't here right now.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.042
But I can come in, though, right, Chic?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.712
I mean, this is still my house.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.233
-Hi.
Betty.

31:42.317 --> 31:46.195
I wasn't going to tell you
about something, but all night long,

31:46.279 --> 31:49.616
I kept tossing and turning
in my canopy sleigh bed thinking,

31:49.699 --> 31:52.994
I'd wanna know. But I take no pleasure
in sharing this with you--

31:53.077 --> 31:56.706
Uh, I gotta go. Chic texted me.
He's at home with my dad.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.541
This is about your father.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.336
I'm onto you.

32:01.419 --> 32:05.340
Your game isn't gonna work with me.
Where's my grandfather's watch?

32:05.423 --> 32:07.508
What are you doing?

32:07.592 --> 32:11.429
-I thought you moved out.
-I did, but I had a change of heart,

32:11.512 --> 32:16.309
and I was feeling like it was time for me
to move back and get answers from him.

32:16.392 --> 32:19.270
But your brother can't seem
to look me in the eyes.

32:19.354 --> 32:23.149
-That's because you're terrifying him.
-Oh, I'm terrifying him.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.817
-Yeah.
Come on, Betty.

32:24.901 --> 32:28.071
What is going on here?
Why does it stink of bleach?

32:28.154 --> 32:30.114
And where is the dining room rug?

32:30.198 --> 32:32.659
I think she sent it out to get cleaned.

32:36.329 --> 32:39.040
Because something is going on
in this house.

32:39.123 --> 32:43.169
This kid is doing what
They're coming through the house.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.922
Who knows what they're stealing
and pawning off?

32:46.005 --> 32:48.132
Speak up. What have your pals taken

32:48.216 --> 32:51.511
-Get away from him, or I will call Mom!

32:51.594 --> 32:54.263
I will tell her about you
and Penelope Blossom.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.603
Maybe the reason
you feel like we're hiding things

33:00.687 --> 33:03.022
and keeping secrets is because you are.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.781
You need to leave, Dad. Now.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.632
-Thank you, Betty.
-I didn't do it for you, I did it for Mom.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.509
What if he comes back?

33:33.136 --> 33:34.679
Or calls the police?

34:00.621 --> 34:03.082
<i>I have to tell you something, Mr. Lodge.</i>

34:05.001 --> 34:06.669
The FBI approached me...

34:08.212 --> 34:11.674
I guess to be a mole or an informant,
to keep tabs on you.

34:12.258 --> 34:14.427
-The FBI did.
-A few weeks ago.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.346
-A few weeks.
-I didn't tell them anything.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.850
-They asked me to plant a bug.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.728
-A bug.
-I smashed it with a hammer.

34:24.437 --> 34:28.232
This agent threatened my dad
because I haven't given up information,

34:28.316 --> 34:33.529
-and I don't think he'll stop until I do.

34:33.613 --> 34:38.034
Because... I like you, Mr. Lodge,
and I love your daughter,

34:38.117 --> 34:42.163
and I think Agent Adams is more
dangerous than you are at this point.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.583
Is that his name

34:46.292 --> 34:47.585
Arthur Adams, yes.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.881
And I was hoping
maybe you could help my dad.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.175
Maybe help us out of this.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.223
Arthur Adams will be dealt with.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.644
-You're not going to--
-No, Archie, no one's going to...

35:07.271 --> 35:10.900
As you can imagine,
it's not my first tangling with the FBI.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.695
Hey, you did the right thing, telling me.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.282
Just give me 24 hours.
I'll make calls and get back to you.

35:24.330 --> 35:28.459
I really didn't tell him anything,
Mr. Lodge, about anything.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.045
And I believe you.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.966
Now go. Wait to hear from me.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.179
Oh, and Archie?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.559
Tell your father
everything's gonna be fine.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.485
<i>Dad was here.</i>

35:54.569 --> 35:56.863
He was pissed off and asking questions.

35:56.946 --> 36:00.241
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, but don't worry. He won't be back.

36:02.201 --> 36:05.121
Mom, we're in way over our heads here.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.791
The shady man's car was parked
outside our house for two days.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.751
-It's okay. Jughead and I took care of it.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.795
-Yes.

36:12.879 --> 36:17.049
I keep thinking about that body
and who might come looking for it,

36:17.133 --> 36:20.887
and how many loose ends are out there
we're not even thinking about.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.889
We need help, Mom.

36:23.472 --> 36:27.602
We can't go to the police. I can't.
I'm sorry, I just can't.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.438
I'm not talking about the police.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.068
-FP--
-Save it. Jughead just told me. All of it.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.909
I won't let you make the same mistake
I made with Jason Blossom. Come on.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.418
Andre?

37:35.294 --> 37:38.506
We're going for a drive.
The boss wants to see you.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.100
You missed the turn to The Pembrooke.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.895
Andre

37:54.313 --> 37:56.482
Boss requested somewhere more private.

37:57.733 --> 37:58.859
Scenic.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.540
[Nouvellas' "Don't Count On Me"
playing on speakers]

38:32.184 --> 38:34.395
-It's done.
Jeez.

38:35.438 --> 38:38.107
-Dad, you reek.
-It's the sodium hydroxide.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.359
In a week, there'll be nothing left.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.862
Not even his teeth.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.287
Thank you, FP,
and I'm sorry for involving Betty,

38:51.996 --> 38:54.582
and that she pulled Jughead into this.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.463
We take care of our own.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.634
The circle ends here.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.554
No more loose ends.

39:10.097 --> 39:13.392
<i>âª I won't count on you to... âª</i> <i>âª I won't count on this to last forever</i>
<i>No âª</i>

39:17.438 --> 39:20.399
<i>âª I won't count on you</i>
<i>For nothing at all âª</i>

39:22.985 --> 39:26.489
<i>âª I won't count on this to last forever</i>
<i>No âª</i>

39:26.572 --> 39:29.533
<i>âª I won't count on you</i>
<i>For nothing at all âª</i>

39:29.784 --> 39:31.410
<i>âª No, no, no âª</i>

39:31.619 --> 39:35.414
<i>âª I won't count on you to say you love me</i>
<i>No âª</i>

39:35.498 --> 39:38.417
<i>âª I won't count on you to save... âª</i>

39:38.834 --> 39:42.630
<i>âª I won't count on this to last forever</i>
<i>No âª</i>

39:42.713 --> 39:45.591
<i>âª I won't count on you</i>
<i>For nothing at all âª</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:52.556
-Just about.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.452
Come on, let's go. Come on.

40:23.629 --> 40:24.922
Here he is, boss.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.092
Thank you, Andre.

40:30.344 --> 40:31.762
Give us a moment.

40:44.984 --> 40:48.696
-Mrs. Lodge.

40:50.197 --> 40:53.659
It's our code of silence.
It states that there is no worse,

40:53.742 --> 40:56.370
no more cowardly crime than snitching.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.038
Mrs. Lodge, I...

40:58.914 --> 41:03.711
would never, ever do anything
to betray your family, I swear.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.755
So you've proven to me
these last few weeks.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.135
Hiram and I,
unbeknownst to our daughter...

41:12.386 --> 41:15.723
enlisted one of our closest associates
to approach you,

41:15.806 --> 41:18.601
say he was an FBI agent
investigating Hiram.

41:19.977 --> 41:24.398
-Agent Adams isn't real. He works for me.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.941
One of my capos.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.069
I asked him
to apply a lot of pressure to you.

41:29.945 --> 41:33.699
Threaten your father, even.
See if you would crack.

41:33.782 --> 41:37.369
Wait. This whole thing,
this was all some kind of test?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.583
Yes, it was.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.129
And you passed.
