<i>- [Justin] Previously on Ugly Betty:
- Hi, Dad.</i>

00:04.104 --> 00:06.868
What happened to that shrimp
I saw last time I was here?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.271
That was a year ago.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.332
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.311
Are you telling me that
you are ready to settle down?

00:15.949 --> 00:18.747
I couldn't tell her
what she wanted to hear, Betty.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.816
It wasn't a very good Thanksgiving.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:42.375 --> 00:44.036
[Betty] Oh, you're up.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.212
- [Gasping]
- Good morning.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.048
What am I doing here?

00:51.117 --> 00:53.881
I picked you up from a bar
on Union Square last night.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.024
Apparently, you sampled
a lot of their fancy Scotches.

00:58.425 --> 01:02.794
- And... what happened after that?
- I showed up to take you home,

01:02.862 --> 01:05.729
but remembered that it's easy
to choke on your own vomit,

01:05.799 --> 01:07.699
you live alone,
so I brought you here.

01:12.272 --> 01:16.140
- You slept... where?
- In your arms.

01:18.144 --> 01:21.307
Relax! I'm kidding.
On the couch, downstairs.

01:21.681 --> 01:25.742
Oh, great. I mean... thanks.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.486
So how are you feeling?

01:27.554 --> 01:30.853
Like, kinda...
Like my tongue is wearing a sweater.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.415
Could you please not do that?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.825
How did things go with Sofia?

01:36.262 --> 01:40.562
Sofia left with her perfect boyfriend.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.569
Who probably proposed to her
with his perfect chin.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.002
What?

01:46.072 --> 01:49.303
She wants a family, Betty.
She wants to settle down.

01:49.375 --> 01:54.039
- Drive a car with a back seat.
- That doesn't sound so terrible.

01:54.114 --> 01:58.175
It does when she doesn't see you
as the guy she wants to do that with.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.582
I'm not that guy, am I?

02:01.654 --> 02:06.057
[Sighing] Maybe you could just stick
to girls who love two-seaters.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.424
You never called back
that one Danish girl.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.395
Don't try and fix this, Betty.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.191
- I lost her.
- I'm not trying to fix it.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.258
I'm just saying... look at me.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.861
Last summer I was mopping up
at a cat hospital.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.930
<i>Today, I'm an executive assistant
at Mode magazine.</i>

02:22.008 --> 02:24.101
A lot can change in a short time.

02:24.944 --> 02:28.277
- [Gasps] Oh.
- Don't... don't choke, don't choke.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.651
No, stay.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.689
I don't get it. It was a holiday!

02:39.759 --> 02:42.523
Clearly, some people thought
it would be an ideal time

02:42.595 --> 02:44.187
to use my office as a prom limo.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.755
[Scoffs] Animals! What'd they do?

02:46.833 --> 02:50.735
They polished off six gift baskets,
rifled through my drawers

02:50.803 --> 02:53.704
and made phone calls from my desk.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.469
What's wrong with people?

02:56.543 --> 02:59.273
Wouldn't they be satisfied
with watching the parade

02:59.345 --> 03:01.813
<i>and The Sound of Music
for the 80th time?</i>

03:01.881 --> 03:03.974
Is that how you spent
your holidays, Marc?

03:04.050 --> 03:06.348
In Schenectady. With my family.

03:06.419 --> 03:07.579
And you came back...?

03:07.687 --> 03:10.019
Right before the von Trapps
escaped the Nazis.

03:10.089 --> 03:13.354
<i>If I leave before Edelweiss,
I can be at home and in bed by midnight.</i>

03:13.426 --> 03:18.261
Marc... I found this under my chaise.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.962
Why are you calling me from the office?

03:24.304 --> 03:26.135
She knows we called from the office.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.571
[Phone ringing]

03:30.376 --> 03:32.606
[Amanda gasping]

03:37.016 --> 03:40.508
Who, on this staff,
would willingly eat something

03:40.587 --> 03:43.681
that's 15 grams of fat per serving?

03:44.591 --> 03:46.218
Uh... Gee...

03:46.292 --> 03:48.157
- You know...
- [phone ringing]

03:48.228 --> 03:51.755
I'll get it.
You study the teeth imprints.

03:54.934 --> 03:59.268
Hello? Ah, Bradford.
How was your holiday?

04:00.406 --> 04:04.069
Oh, no. I'll... I'll turn it on now.

04:06.012 --> 04:09.038
<i>Word has it that Tim, Chloe
and baby Chutney</i>

04:09.115 --> 04:12.346
<i>will stop in Gotham for a layover
on their way to Prague.</i>

04:12.418 --> 04:15.683
<i>Does this mean that New Yorkers
will be the first to lay eyes</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:18.553
<i>on the mysterious baby girl? I hope so.</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:21.389
<i>This New Yorker is starting
to think that Miss Chloe</i>

04:21.461 --> 04:24.760
<i>has been nursing a fat slab
of Swiss cheese.</i>

04:24.831 --> 04:28.062
Wait, are you saying
they chose us to reveal baby Chutney?

04:28.134 --> 04:30.568
[Gasps] Fabulous.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.667
There's writer contracts
that I have to get out today.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.367
I thought it was a paid holiday.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.841
- I'm only gonna be there till noon.
- Right.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.277
Dad, we've got deadlines
and Daniel's been... distracted.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.975
If I wait until Monday to finish,
it'll be too late.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.280
How does your boss take coffee,
on the rocks?

04:46.352 --> 04:51.312
Shh. Dad, please, just let him sleep.
I'm sure I'll be back before he gets up.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.417
Oh, but if I'm not, just offer him
breakfast. Be nice.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.921
Oh, and whatever you do,
don't talk about last night.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.557
Don't mention her name.
He's in really bad shape.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.467
- Who is this woman, anyway?
- What, you don't recognize me?

05:04.537 --> 05:08.405
<i>I'm Memoir of a Geisha...
before she shaved.</i>

05:08.474 --> 05:11.966
I miss the good old days when you
snuck out in the middle of the night.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.741
- Oh, but then we would've missed this.
- [Chuckling]

05:14.814 --> 05:18.306
What do you think, Betty? Can you
put me on the cover of your magazine?

05:18.384 --> 05:21.285
I don't have much say
about what goes on the cover. Sorry.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.322
- Goodbye.
- [Ignacio] Bye.

05:23.389 --> 05:28.122
- You staying for breakfast?
- Yeah, sure. Smells great.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.663
You're a guest in this house.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.632
Sofia?

05:41.808 --> 05:43.969
<i>Hola, Betty. What's wrong?</i>

05:44.043 --> 05:47.035
Nothing. I just didn't expect
to see anybody here today.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.810
When you're launching a magazine
in six weeks, no one gets a Friday off.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.844
Is Daniel coming in too?

05:54.654 --> 05:57.680
Um... I... I'm not sure.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.019
Hmm.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.883
- I'm leaving him a note.
- Well, I'll tell him you stopped by.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.061
Betty, I've left him three messages
since yesterday.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.625
And he has not returned
one of my phone calls.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.672
- And I'm leaving tonight for Maine.
- What's in Maine?

06:13.740 --> 06:17.437
Hunter found some house.
Six bedrooms, huge porch.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.411
Says it's the perfect place
to raise our future family.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.777
Sounds nice.

06:21.848 --> 06:25.545
Yeah, knowing Hunter,
he probably found some old captain

06:25.618 --> 06:28.644
to marry us in a lobster boat,
this weekend.

06:28.721 --> 06:31.189
- Marry.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.290
Great. Congratulations.
Don't forget to pack your Dramamine.

06:38.931 --> 06:42.367
Betty... I don't know what to do.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.597
Listen.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.397
I'm not sure I even want to go.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.210
- Why?
- Well, it's complicated.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.271
A month ago...

06:57.016 --> 06:58.677
...I didn't know Daniel.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.481
Well, have you told him?
Does he know how you feel?

07:01.554 --> 07:02.782
Daniel?

07:02.855 --> 07:05.688
Daniel "So-many-women,
so-little-time" Meade?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.219
I don't think it would matter.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.088
- Do you?
- What? No. I don't know.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.726
I... I just came here to work.
I'm working.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.463
I have to get back to work.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.972
Me too.
I've got a plane to catch.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.882
[Hilda] Papi, can you bring
a plate for Justin?

07:30.950 --> 07:34.181
- [Ignacio] Coming right up.
- Don't forget the salt, please.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.154
- [Ignacio] Yep.
- [Exhaling deeply]

07:37.223 --> 07:39.555
[Justin] So, what are we
putting under our tree?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.150
- Nothing?
- Maybe we won't have one this year.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.492
Not everybody has
a Christmas tree, right?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.794
Sure. But they're Jewish.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.304
We're putting every penny towards
helping Papi. Do you hear me?

07:54.373 --> 07:57.467
[Santos] Hilda. One tree
is not gonna break the bank.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.170
We've always had one.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.368
Hey, boss.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.550
- You OK?
- Hey, Mr. Suarez.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.518
How are you?

08:09.589 --> 08:12.649
I'm cooking.
Stay for breakfast.

08:12.725 --> 08:16.320
I'm not much of a breakfast person.
I should probably just head home.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.919
No.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.692
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.962
Betty told me to feed and water you.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.629
Stay for coffee. You look like hell.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.935
Come on. There you go.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.474
Come on in and sit down.

08:30.877 --> 08:33.505
Mmm-hmm, how about right there?

08:34.046 --> 08:36.537
Good job. OK.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.642
I'll get you a plate.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.819
Yo, I'm Santos. Hilda's...

08:49.562 --> 08:52.087
- Justin's father.
- Oh, right.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.166
- Daniel.
- Meade.

08:55.234 --> 08:58.397
<i>Yeah, I know.
I saw your picture in the Post once.</i>

08:58.471 --> 09:01.463
You dated Angelina when
she was in between boyfriends?

09:02.508 --> 09:04.499
A real player, bro.

09:09.448 --> 09:10.437
Here you go.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.316
How 'bout that?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.912
Enjoy.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.482
Um...

09:20.560 --> 09:22.960
It's the second door on the left!

09:24.430 --> 09:28.161
[Keyboard tapping]

09:29.735 --> 09:32.397
Oh, hi, Mr. Meade. You scared me.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.905
- Did Daniel get my message?
- Regarding?

09:34.974 --> 09:36.339
Baby Chutney.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.674
Tim and Chloe have given us
a three-hour window to shoot her.

09:39.745 --> 09:43.340
<i>Tim and Chloe? Mode's getting
the first pictures of baby Chutney?</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:46.749
Shut up! I mean, that's really exciting.

09:46.819 --> 09:49.379
Well, it will be
if my son can pull this off.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.116
He is here, isn't he?

09:51.190 --> 09:54.921
Wilhelmina's called in some staffers
and she's on her way to greet the plane.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.657
Bradford, I was thinking we
approach this from a family angle?

09:58.731 --> 10:01.757
You know, how the first-born
changes everything.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.699
I like that.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.227
Tell Daniel that
since we're short-staffed,

10:07.306 --> 10:11.299
Sofia's volunteered to write the copy.
They'll make a great team.

10:15.381 --> 10:19.681
No. I can't be there, Betty.
I'm a total mess.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.549
Tell her I'm a mess.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.089
Betty, he's a mess.

10:24.857 --> 10:29.021
<i>He can't hold down my huevos
and he's got a fever.</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:32.161
- Baby who?
- Oh, no.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.156
- Baby Chutney.
- Baby Chutney?

10:35.234 --> 10:37.725
Tim and Chloe
have given us three hours.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.794
Sofia's come up with a family angle.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.965
Yeah, Tim and Chloe.
Explain that one.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.669
He sleeps with every woman
who brings him coffee,

10:44.744 --> 10:47.679
- and now he's Mr. Family Man?
- Are you still drunk?

10:48.714 --> 10:50.614
Wait. Did you say Sofia?

10:51.117 --> 10:53.915
My Sofia. What,
is Hunter the Chin there too?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.817
Daniel, you have to be here.

10:55.888 --> 11:00.757
I am sick, Betty. I'm still drunk.
I can't face her.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.590
Besides, what do I know
about shooting a family spread?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.925
[Doorbell rings]

11:04.997 --> 11:08.091
<i>- Just cover for me.
- No! I can't take charge of this.</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:11.136
- [People chattering over phone]
- What's going on there?

11:11.203 --> 11:13.637
Oh, the tree I ordered just arrived.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.266
- The what?
- The Christmas tree for your family.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.570
Why did you get us a tree?

11:17.643 --> 11:20.771
I threw up in four rooms
of your house. It's the least I can do.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.746
- How did you...?
- It was no big deal.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.340
I just called the company florist.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.579
[Justin] Oh, my God!

11:31.924 --> 11:34.916
- [Call disconnected]
- Daniel. Daniel!

11:37.196 --> 11:40.632
- Where is he?
- He's on his way.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.565
OK.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.247
- [Man] Is he here?
- I'm sorry, you are...

12:04.323 --> 12:07.258
This is Bruno... Jacobs.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.587
Stylist.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.991
I was called in
to help him coordinate today.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.330
- Of course! Mr. Bruno, hi, I'm Betty...
- Where's Daniel?

12:16.402 --> 12:19.394
He is... on his way.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.238
He's getting a gift for baby Chutney.

12:23.309 --> 12:27.177
- Isn't that your job?
- Daniel is very hands-on.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.373
Clock is ticking.
We need to talk concept.

12:29.448 --> 12:32.383
You know, we were thinking
of something family-oriented.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.214
They're movie stars.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.346
OK... well...
What are your thoughts?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.085
Daniel requested that you
share them with me.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.391
Really?

12:44.764 --> 12:49.360
Well, my first thought is coffee.
I like it hot.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.225
OK.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.728
Here. Drink this.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.671
It'll help.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.107
Thanks. I really appreciate this.

12:58.177 --> 13:01.044
Oh, we really appreciate the tree.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.973
This isn't Betty's bonus, right?

13:05.151 --> 13:08.245
I say we take the door off the
hinges and cut off some branches.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.787
Yo, Justin, you got a saw?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.886
I got it. I got it.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.791
You guys did an
awesome article last December

13:15.861 --> 13:17.761
on how to make icicles out of Mylar.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.128
- I saved that issue.
- Really?

13:20.199 --> 13:22.963
Well, more for the article
on that old queen of Hungary.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.866
I didn't know you were into history.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.929
She used to sleep wrapped up
in a sheet with raw steaks.

13:28.007 --> 13:31.807
It removed her toxins.
Her skin was flawless.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.606
- Flawless?
- Flawless.

13:35.347 --> 13:36.780
Good for her.

13:38.717 --> 13:39.911
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.513
Tell me something. How long
does Santos plan on sticking around?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.524
Look, Papi, I can take care of myself.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.787
It's not you I'm worried about.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.455
Justin could use
another man in his life right now.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.727
What happens when this man
disappears again for three years?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.997
[Sighing] Back off, would you?

13:58.070 --> 14:00.834
Give him a chance to be a father.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.380
We can dump the water
on her from behind,

14:11.450 --> 14:13.645
he can shoot high-speed
from a low angle.

14:13.719 --> 14:18.053
Genius. Love using that
mermaid movie Chloe did for inspiration.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.217
If the baby doesn't
see the water coming... bam!

14:21.293 --> 14:22.385
Pure drama.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.827
You're gonna dump water on the baby?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.100
Is that the concept?

14:34.240 --> 14:37.368
Do you have a non-dairy creamer?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.376
Is everybody onboard with this?

14:41.013 --> 14:42.241
I mean...

14:42.314 --> 14:47.115
I, personally, think that a wet baby
ambush could be very dynamic.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.580
But... but Daniel might not.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.189
I'm gonna check on that creamer, OK?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.594
Of course I approve, Betty.
This is Bruno Jacobs, hon.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.036
He styled Madonna
while she was giving birth.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.131
Made her belly sweat look like diamonds.

and let him do his work.

[Texting beeps]

15:32.898 --> 15:36.026
What about Amanda?
Where did she spend her holiday?

15:36.101 --> 15:38.228
Uh... Um...

15:38.304 --> 15:40.465
I think she went to Vermont.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.331
Oh, I can't wait to meet baby Chutney.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.606
I hope she spits up on something
so I can sell it on the Internet.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.615
Now how could Amanda get back from
Vermont so fast? It doesn't make sense.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.884
<i>Uh... Oh, scusi. It's Amanda.</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:56.945
Hello.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.253
Oh, it's just a text message.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.552
"Forget the cashews. You're the one
who had to be Nancy Drew."

16:05.831 --> 16:06.991
Look, I can explain.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.125
You held that nut in your hand and lied!

16:09.201 --> 16:11.601
- I never touched your cashews.
- That was Amanda.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.662
You are the one who made
the phone calls. You are Nancy Drew!

16:14.740 --> 16:18.699
- [Wheezing] I didn't learn anything.
- Then why are you wheezing?

16:20.145 --> 16:24.104
You have a friend in a surgical hospital
that likes to chat.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.073
About what?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.483
I don't know.
I was drinking and dialing.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.352
Oh, you are done dialing, Nancy.

to go meet baby Chutney on the tarmac!

I need to talk to him. Is he upright?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.671
Technically, yes.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.608
- Daniel.
- Betty.

Let me talk to him.
Let me talk to him.

One second.

17:04.522 --> 17:09.153
Is that Sofia? Don't tell her it's me.
I can't deal with this today.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.856
Daniel, I can't hear you!
You're breaking up!

17:11.930 --> 17:14.022
I need to ask him.
I need his input on this.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.761
Call me when you get
off the gift wrapping floor! Bye!

17:16.835 --> 17:19.269

- Did he ask about me?

17:19.338 --> 17:21.829
Uh, maybe. I couldn't hear very well.

Oh, if you freeze-frame the fight scene,
he is not wearing a cod piece.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.486
I know. Could this be tailored?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.794
Maybe with a blowtorch.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.793
Let's go with this. It's edgy.

17:50.869 --> 17:54.236
Don't you think that we should
wait for Daniel's opinion?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.038
And where is he?

17:56.108 --> 18:00.704
He's coming. But I just don't think
he's gonna go for a baby in chainlink.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.111
- It's chain mail.
- Whatever.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.946
If she tries to move in that
she's gonna need first aid.

it's tender...

- [Ignacio] Reindeer.
- Ah.

18:43.689 --> 18:47.216
My late wife made this for me
our first Christmas in New York.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.459
Her feet were always cold
so she put boots on everything.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.294
- So most of these are homemade?
- Oh, yeah.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.699
Careful with that. It's older than you.

- I made this one.

something safer. Maybe a plastic bag!

Betty, you didn't grow up
wanting to be my assistant.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.027
You have your own dreams.

40:01.665 --> 40:03.599
I would never stand in your way.

40:12.376 --> 40:13.570
[Phone ringing]

40:14.211 --> 40:17.203
- Wilhelmina Slater's office.
- Is she there?

40:18.282 --> 40:22.514
- Who may I say is calling?
- An old friend from college.

40:28.459 --> 40:31.428
Line two. An old friend from college.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.589
Which you never went to.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.561
It's Wilhelmina.

40:37.635 --> 40:42.095
Why is someone named Pradip
answering your cell phone?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.604
Marc, can I have some privacy, please?

40:45.676 --> 40:47.268
Come on, Willie.

40:47.344 --> 40:49.938
We don't have any secrets.
Not anymore.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.244
We're in this together, right?

40:52.316 --> 40:54.580
I'll call you right back.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.079
What do you want, Marc?

41:01.058 --> 41:03.526
Job security. A title.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.426
And my own company
credit card would be nice.

41:07.498 --> 41:11.628
[Hilda] Wow, he was such a nice guy.
Not at all what I expected.

41:11.702 --> 41:16.071
<i>- Well, he was a little hung over.
- Mija, I'm not talking about Daniel!</i>

41:16.140 --> 41:19.234
I'm talking about Tim! There was
a movie star in my house today!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.675
[Justin] There was two!

41:20.744 --> 41:25.272
- So when do we see the pictures?
- I guess when they hit the newsstands.

41:25.349 --> 41:28.614
I might be able to sneak home a copy,
if I'm still working there.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.278
Wait, what do you mean "if"?

41:30.354 --> 41:34.814
<i>Well, I could be working at Mode or I
could be working at another magazine.</i>

41:34.892 --> 41:38.453
Another magazine? You mean
there's two magazines that want you?

41:38.529 --> 41:39.996
Yeah! Can you believe that?

41:40.064 --> 41:41.964
- Betty, who?
- When did this happen?

41:42.032 --> 41:43.966
- [Doorbell rings]
- I'll get it.

41:44.034 --> 41:46.901
But, Betty, no news till I get back.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.736
- [Hilda] Dad, just...
- [Justin] Just tell us.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.775
- [Hilda] He's gonna be back...
- Wait.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.309
[Betty] Stop! I'm not gonna!

41:53.377 --> 41:54.742
[Justin] God, you're so...

42:02.152 --> 42:04.347
- Can I help you?
- Ignacio Suarez?

42:04.421 --> 42:05.820
That's me.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.222
We're lmmigration
and Customs Enforcement.

42:08.292 --> 42:11.227
- What can I do for you?
- You have to come with us, sir.

42:11.295 --> 42:14.731
- Why?
- Mr. Suarez, you're under arrest.
