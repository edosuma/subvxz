WEBVTT

00:03.340 --> 00:05.269
Hey, Ma.

00:09.902 --> 00:12.964
Ma, where's that little
green bag I left in here?

00:12.989 --> 00:15.549
It had my, uh... school supplies in it.

00:15.550 --> 00:18.610
I flushed your school
supplies down the toilet.

00:18.849 --> 00:21.419
- What?
- And the $12,000 that was in there,

00:21.420 --> 00:23.150
I donated to the church.

00:23.175 --> 00:25.443
No, no, no, no, Ma,
you don't understand.

00:25.468 --> 00:27.316
I have to answer for that, Ma.

00:27.341 --> 00:29.870
You told me that you
were selling sneakers!

00:32.362 --> 00:34.647
Listen, I knew you'd be
trippin' if I told you the truth.

00:34.672 --> 00:37.448
Look, Ma, there ain't no jobs out there

00:37.473 --> 00:39.672
payin' no real money, Ma.
I'm doin' what I gotta do.

00:39.682 --> 00:41.881
Even after what happened to your father?

00:41.882 --> 00:43.082
Look, I don't use, I sell.

00:45.721 --> 00:47.051
Get out of my house.

00:47.939 --> 00:49.209
There's your stuff.

00:51.744 --> 00:54.244
Get out of my house!

00:58.832 --> 01:01.114
There's nothing
stronger than a mother's love

01:01.139 --> 01:03.305
except a mother's disappointment.

01:04.202 --> 01:06.392
And that's the cold, hard truth,

01:06.417 --> 01:07.939
even for an OG.

- Hey, hey, don't do that.

01:20.884 --> 01:22.451
I love making my Mother's Day cards.

01:22.452 --> 01:24.182
It says it comes from the heart.

01:24.192 --> 01:25.974
No, it says, "I'm broke".

01:25.999 --> 01:27.577
I just enjoy crafting.

01:27.602 --> 01:29.180
Can you pass me the scissors
that make the squiggle?

01:29.204 --> 01:30.664
You mean the edging scissors?

01:31.626 --> 01:34.066
Women like it when you work with
your hands to bring them joy.

01:34.284 --> 01:36.943
- Stop making Mother's Day sound so sexy.
- What?

01:36.968 --> 01:39.317
This for my baby mama,
who has big titties,

01:39.342 --> 01:40.541
just like my mama.

01:40.566 --> 01:42.566
You know what? I envy you guys, man.

01:42.591 --> 01:44.650
Why, Tray? Your mom flat-chested?

01:44.675 --> 01:46.486
Damn it, Alejandro, no!

01:47.572 --> 01:50.081
It's been almost 30 years
since my mother threw me out.

01:51.454 --> 01:52.966
Damn, that's a long time, man.

01:52.991 --> 01:54.681
- Long-ass time.
- Tell me about it.

01:55.527 --> 01:57.151
I disappointed her so much, man,

01:57.176 --> 01:58.679
she wouldn't return
none of my phone calls

01:58.703 --> 01:59.996
or my cards that I wrote her from jail.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.991
I mean, nothing. Nothing.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.332
But, well, I'm sayin',
you a changed man now.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.196
You know, dude's doing so much better.

02:06.221 --> 02:08.951
You might be right, you know?

02:09.045 --> 02:11.575
Maybe if she saw me now,
turned my life around

02:11.600 --> 02:14.900
and trying to get my food-truck
business up off the ground,

02:14.925 --> 02:17.011
maybe she won't be
so disappointed in me.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.971
She might even be proud of me.

02:19.996 --> 02:21.065
You need to go see her.

02:22.436 --> 02:24.356
I don't even know where
she lives anymore, man.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.761
What about your pops?

02:26.234 --> 02:27.803
My pops died when I was a kid.

02:28.503 --> 02:30.142
He was real important to me, too.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.858
But one thing my father always said,

02:32.882 --> 02:34.682
"You know where you can
always find your mother...

02:34.706 --> 02:36.261
- in our old church".
- Hmm.

02:36.262 --> 02:37.391
She'd never miss a Sunday.

02:37.392 --> 02:38.791
Now that sounds like a plan.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.531
Yeah, she can't yell at you in church.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.196
Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho!

We certainly have enjoyed hearing

03:32.600 --> 03:34.940
the lovely stories and testimonies

03:34.965 --> 03:37.051
from some of you about your mothers.

03:37.052 --> 03:39.991
Now, we want to move on to
the next part of service.

03:39.992 --> 03:41.191
Turn with me...

03:41.216 --> 03:44.455
Pastor, is it too late for
me to be a part of this?

03:45.332 --> 03:46.892
Ex... Excuse me, sir?

03:47.580 --> 03:48.982
My name is Tray Barker.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.401
And I would like to share my testimony.

03:54.412 --> 03:55.581
Brother Barker.

03:56.713 --> 03:57.802
Come on down.

Advertise your product or brand here

04:07.409 --> 04:09.178
This is more than a testimony.

04:09.694 --> 04:12.224
This is a moment to ask for forgiveness.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.948
I remember coming here as a kid.

04:15.492 --> 04:18.031
Stealing my first kiss right
over there in the corner.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.731
From Terolyn Bigelow,
during choir practice.

04:22.031 --> 04:24.901
I mean, that girl had talent,
and she could sing, too.

04:27.285 --> 04:28.984
Man, let me tell you somethin'.

04:29.572 --> 04:31.195
my head was in the streets.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.997
Slingin' crack was my thing.

04:34.761 --> 04:36.391
I did business everywhere.

04:37.249 --> 04:40.074
I'm ashamed to say, sometimes
even on church grounds.

04:40.099 --> 04:41.368
All right.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.532
Nice to see you, Willie.
You lookin' good.

04:43.781 --> 04:45.450
It's Deacon Harris now, Tray.

04:45.722 --> 04:48.421
Deacon Harris has a sweeter ring

04:48.555 --> 04:50.255
than "Slick Stick" Willie.

04:52.765 --> 04:55.601
You know, I did a long time in prison.

04:55.602 --> 04:56.801
It's where I learned to cook.

04:57.472 --> 04:59.542
It's why you see me out here
trying to get my food truck

04:59.566 --> 05:00.717
up and running, you know?

05:00.742 --> 05:04.711
And anybody in the congregation,
you get 20% of any entrée.

05:05.077 --> 05:06.237
Yes!

05:07.876 --> 05:09.575
But that's not why I'm here.

05:10.579 --> 05:12.108
I've thought long and hard

05:12.762 --> 05:14.474
about the hurt and
pain I caused you, Ma.

05:14.969 --> 05:16.768
Sorry for all the years of pain...

05:17.768 --> 05:18.919
and disappointment.

05:19.811 --> 05:22.010
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

05:35.172 --> 05:36.371
Hell no!

05:40.576 --> 05:41.746
All right.

05:45.703 --> 05:47.842
Well, here we are.

05:48.555 --> 05:51.624
Roberta, I-I see an opportunity
here for forgiveness.

05:51.649 --> 05:54.339
You have a real-life
prodigal son coming home.

05:54.364 --> 05:57.293
Seems more like a broke son
comin' home to ask for money.

05:57.770 --> 05:58.858
You heard him.

05:58.990 --> 06:02.059
Yeah, using the pulpit
to promote his food truck?

06:02.490 --> 06:04.789
Doing business in the house of the Lord?

06:05.195 --> 06:07.085
I'm not here to ask for money.

06:07.647 --> 06:09.107
Those shoes beg to differ.

06:09.132 --> 06:10.242
I understand, son.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.396
You know. Why pay more
when you can pay less?

06:15.139 --> 06:16.576
So, you want me to forget

06:16.601 --> 06:20.812
that he chose to sell
crack over his family, huh?

06:20.822 --> 06:22.282
You're the one that threw me out!

06:22.307 --> 06:25.151
You threw yourself out when
you brought drugs into my house.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.821
That was 30 years ago.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.291
When are you gonna stop
being mad at me, Ma?

06:30.292 --> 06:32.792
I didn't know there was
a time limit on my anger.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.313
Pastor, how long should I be mad?

06:36.338 --> 06:37.537
Now, mind you,

06:37.562 --> 06:39.677
my husband didn't go
to Vietnam a junkie,

06:39.702 --> 06:41.201
but he came back one,

06:41.226 --> 06:43.026
which led him to getting AIDS.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.713
And I had to stand there
and helplessly watch him die!

06:46.738 --> 06:49.477
And my son, he chose to sell drugs,

06:49.502 --> 06:52.501
the very thing that killed his father.

06:52.589 --> 06:54.628
How many years of
anger does that buy me?

06:55.964 --> 06:57.594
Mommy, I just want to start over.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.298
It's not that simple.

07:02.227 --> 07:04.096
Sister Barker, let's keep it 100.

07:04.435 --> 07:07.065
If I didn't give everybody
in this church a do-over,

07:07.090 --> 07:10.150
this place would be empty, you included.

07:10.505 --> 07:14.064
You know, I don't have
anything else to say.

07:14.089 --> 07:15.348
Okay, fine.

07:15.992 --> 07:18.872
I just thought maybe that you might
want to meet your grandkids.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.230
I got grandkids?

07:21.621 --> 07:23.290
Why didn't you say that to begin with?

07:23.690 --> 07:25.559
This brother got some explaining to do.

07:25.584 --> 07:27.013
Mommy. Mommy, look.

07:27.317 --> 07:28.717
It's twins.

07:30.359 --> 07:32.488
That's Amira and that's Shahzad.

07:32.513 --> 07:33.682
What do you know?

07:34.425 --> 07:35.536
One of each.

07:40.371 --> 07:41.430
Oh.

07:42.575 --> 07:44.792
Now, this don't have nothin'
to do with you and me.

07:46.572 --> 07:49.297
But if... if you can arrange...

07:49.722 --> 07:52.411
for me to meet my grandchildren,

07:53.300 --> 07:54.399
I'll be there.

07:54.997 --> 07:57.536
Amira and Shahzad Barker.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.651
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.749
Well, actually, it's Birkeland.

08:04.483 --> 08:05.913
Oh, a different daddy?

08:06.998 --> 08:08.858
Ooh. Didn't see that one coming.

08:13.431 --> 08:17.380
Man, it felt so good to see
my mother after all these years.

08:17.978 --> 08:19.620
It made me realize what I missed out on.

08:19.645 --> 08:20.922
I want to get that back.

08:20.947 --> 08:22.142
That's beautiful, Cuz.

08:22.143 --> 08:23.452
So, was she happy to see you, too?

08:23.476 --> 08:26.657
At first, she was colder
than day-old Chinese food,

08:26.682 --> 08:28.541
but when I told her she had grandkids,

08:28.566 --> 08:30.881
the polar ice caps around
her heart started to melt.

08:30.906 --> 08:33.106
That's like if Tyler
Perry made "Frozen,"

08:33.517 --> 08:34.976
she would be the villain.

08:35.001 --> 08:37.601
Bobby, none of that
talk around Shay, okay?

08:37.626 --> 08:39.020
Your job is to help me convince her

08:39.022 --> 08:40.674
to let her kids see they grandmother.

08:40.698 --> 08:42.135
What mother wouldn't want her kids

08:42.159 --> 08:44.650
to see their sweet,
long-lost grandmother?

08:44.675 --> 08:47.317
Why would I expose my
happy, well-adjusted kids

08:47.342 --> 08:49.331
to a woman you said ruined your life?

08:49.425 --> 08:51.094
Well, she didn't ruin my life, Shay.

08:51.119 --> 08:52.588
I ruined my life. I was out there.

08:52.613 --> 08:54.232
I was young and dumb
and trying to get some.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.188
She kicked you out
when you was 17, Tray.

08:56.213 --> 08:59.019
Back in the days, that's the way
moms handled business.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.112
You said her nickname was "Skillet,"

09:01.137 --> 09:03.784
'cause when she beat
you, she had a heavy hand.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.592
Oh, man.

09:05.617 --> 09:08.156
Auntie Roberta, she had a heavy hand.

09:08.252 --> 09:10.903
Whew! She used to break the
toilet handles when she'd flush.

09:10.928 --> 09:12.071
You know what I'm talkin' about?

09:12.095 --> 09:13.555
Oh, man, it was...

09:15.880 --> 09:18.461
I'm gonna... Yeah,
I'm gonna go in there.

09:18.486 --> 09:19.785
I'm gonna go in there.

09:22.722 --> 09:24.851
Please, Shannon, this
is important to me.

09:25.645 --> 09:28.641
Amira and Shahzad are the greatest
thing to ever happen to me,

09:29.087 --> 09:30.556
that I ever been a part of.

09:31.197 --> 09:32.996
Now, I know you and Josh raised them,

09:33.334 --> 09:35.103
but they got some of me in them, too.

09:35.428 --> 09:38.288
If you let my mom see them
and she start to love them,

09:38.313 --> 09:39.642
and I know she gonna love them,

09:39.722 --> 09:42.922
then maybe she'll learn
to love me again, too.

09:44.492 --> 09:47.970
Hey, babe, I mean, you could
at least meet her, right?

09:47.995 --> 09:49.195
That seems fair.

09:50.018 --> 09:51.147
Just meet her?

09:51.306 --> 09:52.335
Okay.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.358
I'll meet her, and I'll make a decision.

09:54.954 --> 09:57.978
But if she's anything like the way
you guys painted her to be,

09:58.003 --> 09:59.874
I don't want her around
my children at all.

09:59.899 --> 10:00.978
Deal!

10:01.003 --> 10:02.271
Thank you so much.

10:02.296 --> 10:03.463
I'll make all the arrangements,

10:03.487 --> 10:05.516
and then I'll let you guys know, okay?

10:05.813 --> 10:09.851
Until then, I want you two to have
a blessed rest of the day, okay?

10:10.378 --> 10:11.577
See you then.

10:11.602 --> 10:13.002
Tray, you forgettin' something.

10:13.027 --> 10:14.356
Oh, you got a nice hairdo.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.911
Uh, no. Take your flunky with you.

10:16.936 --> 10:18.836
- Bobby!
- Y'all want an omelet?

10:18.861 --> 10:20.021
Come on! Let's go!

10:20.046 --> 10:21.105
Okay.

10:21.130 --> 10:24.199
Um, I noticed you were
missing a few things, so I...

10:24.809 --> 10:27.078
- Bobby, come on!
- I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.960
Let's go. Let's go.

10:29.985 --> 10:31.314
- Come on.
- I do okay?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.538
Yes, you did great.

10:32.563 --> 10:33.733
Let's go, champ.

10:36.464 --> 10:40.511
Shannon, I appreciate you are
very protective of your children.

10:40.860 --> 10:42.924
But you don't have anything
to worry about with me.

10:42.949 --> 10:44.597
I don't smoke, I don't drink,

10:44.622 --> 10:46.351
I own my own duplex

10:46.376 --> 10:49.776
in a very safe area off Myrtle Avenue.

10:49.801 --> 10:53.330
It's right across from Kum Kau Chicken.

10:53.355 --> 10:56.555
- Oh. Hey, babe, you love that place.
- It's a'ight.

10:56.744 --> 10:59.885
Amira and Shahzad will
be in really good hands.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.737
Why don't we just set up some time

11:01.762 --> 11:03.743
for me to spend the afternoon with them?

11:03.768 --> 11:05.544
I was thinking about next week,

11:05.569 --> 11:07.863
- like Wednesday or Thursday. Or Fr...
- You know what?

11:07.888 --> 11:10.887
I really appreciate
your enthusiasm, Roberta.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.711
Honestly, I do.

11:12.955 --> 11:17.609
But my kids, they have been
through a lot over the last year,

11:17.643 --> 11:19.797
and I don't want to
rush them into anything.

11:19.822 --> 11:21.281
We're still trying to figure out

11:21.306 --> 11:23.194
how Tray fits into their lives.

11:23.219 --> 11:25.266
And... how can I say this?

11:25.678 --> 11:27.757
I don't want another
variable in the equation.

11:27.782 --> 11:30.122
I'm hungry. What... Tray,
what are you gonna have?

11:30.132 --> 11:31.261
Why don't you order for me?

11:31.286 --> 11:32.623
I mean, since you're paying for it.

11:32.647 --> 11:36.231
Well, I think it would help the children

11:36.390 --> 11:38.892
to meet their grandmother Roberta.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.701
Let them get acquainted
with another member

11:41.726 --> 11:43.986
of the Barker side of the family.

11:44.011 --> 11:45.971
- You know what, Roberta? No disrespect.
- Mm-hmm.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.437
I know that it's important
to you to meet my kids,

11:48.462 --> 11:51.591
but it's up to me to decide
if I think they're ready.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.376
There's so... so much on this menu.

11:54.401 --> 11:56.130
Club chicken sandwich looks good.

11:56.155 --> 11:58.297
- I'm not doing bread right now.
- What is wrong with bread?

11:58.321 --> 11:59.460
Baby girl...

12:00.020 --> 12:03.089
I've been on this planet a long time.

12:03.114 --> 12:05.291
- Mm-hmm.
- And if there's one thing I know,

12:05.292 --> 12:06.970
it's how to raise children.

12:07.562 --> 12:09.562
And I'm certain of one thing...

12:09.572 --> 12:12.794
children need their grandmother.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.501
Oh, my throat is so parched.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.101
Anybody need any water?

12:16.102 --> 12:18.241
Hey, could we get some
more agua over here?

12:18.242 --> 12:20.439
You put Tray out when
he was 17 years old,

12:20.464 --> 12:23.394
and my twins, they're not
that much younger than that.

12:23.419 --> 12:27.629
And you did no more mothering
after you put him out.

12:27.654 --> 12:30.678
So, to me, it seems that
we have the same amount

12:30.703 --> 12:32.772
of mothering experience,

12:33.056 --> 12:36.710
so your whole, "I've been
doing this a long time" routine

12:36.735 --> 12:38.678
isn't cutting it with me, honey.

12:38.703 --> 12:40.992
Mommy, she didn't mean it.

12:41.002 --> 12:42.931
It's not as bad as she's
making it sound like.

12:42.932 --> 12:44.062
You know what I mean?

12:44.072 --> 12:46.071
She's not judging you.
She ain't judging you.

12:46.072 --> 12:48.004
That's not even Shay.
She ain't even like that.

12:48.029 --> 12:50.775
Her mother was a crackhead,
for crying out loud, yo.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.270
She understands that all
mothers aren't perfect.

12:54.553 --> 12:56.552
Oh. Shannon?

12:57.432 --> 13:01.598
Did your mother get to spend time
with your kids before she passed?

13:01.623 --> 13:02.742
Of course.

13:02.767 --> 13:06.098
So, a crackhead, dope-fiend junkie...

13:06.123 --> 13:08.543
- Oh, God, no.
- ... got to spend time with your kids,

13:08.568 --> 13:11.757
yet I'm the one who's not good enough?

13:11.782 --> 13:12.782
Huh?

13:12.807 --> 13:14.076
- Josh...
- Yep, I saw that...

13:14.101 --> 13:15.630
- ... it's time to go.
- Yeah.

13:16.032 --> 13:18.521
Tray, your mother
hasn't changed one bit.

13:18.546 --> 13:22.184
I am not subjecting
my kids to the Skillet.

13:22.209 --> 13:23.339
Skillet?

13:23.404 --> 13:25.833
I meant Skillet in a beautiful way, Ma,

13:26.040 --> 13:27.509
like black and beautiful.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.840
Can't recommend the
eggs benedict enough.

13:30.865 --> 13:33.135
- The hollandaise sauce...
- Josh!

13:43.862 --> 13:45.391
We're just sitting
down for dinner, Tray.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.261
- What is it?
- I don't think you're being fair, Shay.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.201
You need to give this
thing a second chance.

13:50.202 --> 13:52.271
Even Frazier forgave Ali.

13:52.272 --> 13:54.532
It's not your decision to make, Tray.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.507
Maybe we should let the children decide.

13:56.532 --> 13:57.638
Decide what?

13:57.663 --> 13:58.935
Y'all want to meet my mother?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.611
Of course I want to meet her!

14:00.612 --> 14:02.281
- Me too.
- You son of a bitch.

14:02.282 --> 14:04.911
- Why you bringing the kids into this?
- It's about the kids.

14:04.936 --> 14:07.475
My mother is the only
grandparent they got left.

14:08.034 --> 14:09.964
No, you knew what they would say.

14:10.212 --> 14:11.641
It's like you went ahead and said,

14:11.666 --> 14:14.131
"Hey, I wanted to take
y'all to Disneyland,

14:14.156 --> 14:15.491
but your mama wouldn't let me".

14:15.492 --> 14:17.761
I mean, I'd rather meet my grandmother

14:17.762 --> 14:19.561
instead of going to Disneyland.

14:19.562 --> 14:21.501
That's 'cause you can't ride the rides.

14:21.502 --> 14:23.831
Now, look what you done
started. Tray, just leave.

14:23.832 --> 14:25.431
Hey, whoa, Shannon, Shannon,

14:25.432 --> 14:26.632
I think you're overreacting.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.186
I suggest you stand down.

14:28.211 --> 14:30.102
No, I mean, if the kids want
to meet their grandmother,

14:30.112 --> 14:31.842
- I don't see the harm in that.
- Josh.

14:35.383 --> 14:36.512
Sorry, kids.

14:37.784 --> 14:38.912
I tried.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.126
Bye, Tray.

14:53.802 --> 14:57.162
Hm.

15:08.432 --> 15:09.961
Hi, Roberta.

15:09.986 --> 15:11.055
Is this...?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.178
This is Shahzad and Amira.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.672
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:14.697 --> 15:16.027
Your grandchildren.

15:19.034 --> 15:21.138
Did Shannon change her mind?

15:21.416 --> 15:22.804
Not really, no.

15:22.829 --> 15:23.947
She doesn't know we're here,

15:23.971 --> 15:27.348
but the kids kept getting caught
in the middle of everything,

15:27.373 --> 15:28.805
and I thought they deserved a chance

15:28.829 --> 15:30.320
to at least meet their grandmother.

15:30.391 --> 15:32.001
You're a brave man, Josh.

15:32.026 --> 15:33.364
Sometimes.

15:33.389 --> 15:34.847
Uh, can we come in?

15:34.872 --> 15:37.202
- Oh, I'm sorry. Come. Come in.
- Come on, guys.

15:37.494 --> 15:39.293
Wow.

15:39.765 --> 15:42.234
Look at you.

15:43.122 --> 15:45.863
You look just like I did at your age.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.208
And you are the spitting
image of your father.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.903
- Mm-hmm.
- Poor thing.

15:50.928 --> 15:52.127
I hope you're smart.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.754
Um, yeah.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.429
Okay.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.338
Well, you gonna get the both
of us in a lot of trouble.

15:58.363 --> 16:00.129
Hey, you let me worry about that.

16:00.154 --> 16:02.209
Just sorry I didn't
give you more notice.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.164
Oh, please. Are you kidding?

16:04.323 --> 16:05.720
I've been preparing for this

16:05.745 --> 16:07.744
ever since Tray told me about them.

16:07.851 --> 16:10.311
You were that excited to meet us?

16:10.336 --> 16:12.065
Oh, girl, you have no idea.

16:12.090 --> 16:13.881
I have everything here

16:13.906 --> 16:16.129
from Easter outfits to savings bonds.

16:16.154 --> 16:18.668
I think I went overboard just a little.

16:18.693 --> 16:19.793
That depends.

16:19.818 --> 16:21.421
What kind of interest rate did you get?

16:22.052 --> 16:24.874
- Shahzad.
- I mean, thank you.

16:25.378 --> 16:28.092
All right, well, I'll be back
in a couple hours to get them, then.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.878
You're a good man, Josh Birkeland.

16:31.982 --> 16:34.381
Not the goofball I
first thought you were.

16:34.565 --> 16:35.634
Thanks.

16:35.659 --> 16:36.920
All right, well, you guys have fun.

16:36.944 --> 16:38.327
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Dad.

16:38.352 --> 16:40.352
Okay, first things first.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.799
Have you two been baptized?

16:41.824 --> 16:42.991
- No.
- Okay.

16:43.016 --> 16:45.019
Well, we gonna take care
of that when he goes.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.681
I'm joking, Josh. Get outta here.

16:48.682 --> 16:50.042
I knew you were joking.

16:53.777 --> 16:56.344
Took a big risk, my man.
I appreciate it.

16:56.369 --> 16:58.168
But Shay gonna kill your ass, though.

16:58.193 --> 17:00.593
Well, you know what? I
did this for all of us.

17:00.989 --> 17:02.814
That's right. That's what you tell Shay.

17:02.839 --> 17:04.138
And you don't be scared.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.227
I'm not scared.

17:06.252 --> 17:09.050
I mean, I... I just don't
think it's gonna be easy.

17:09.076 --> 17:10.688
Well, I get that, but
this is what you do.

17:10.712 --> 17:12.501
You puff your chest out. Puff it out.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.632
- What are you talking about?
- Your chest, bring it out!

17:14.642 --> 17:16.458
- You stand like a man.
- All right.

17:16.483 --> 17:18.190
Stand like a man.
Broaden your shoulders.

17:18.214 --> 17:20.531
- Am I not? I feel like I am.
- All right, and you don't hold back.

17:20.555 --> 17:22.102
No. And you tell her this.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.325
"I know you upset,

17:23.349 --> 17:26.027
but I'm putting my foot
down on this one, okay?

17:26.051 --> 17:29.434
I did the right thing for the kids".

17:29.625 --> 17:30.884
Say that.

17:30.948 --> 17:33.887
Listen, Shay, I know you're upset,

17:33.977 --> 17:36.446
but I'm putting my
foot down on this one.

17:36.471 --> 17:39.670
I did the right thing,
and I did it for the kids.

17:39.782 --> 17:41.081
You did what?

17:41.106 --> 17:44.575
Listen, Shay, I know
you're upset, but I...

17:45.096 --> 17:46.235
You what?

17:47.372 --> 17:49.641
I... I'm sorry?

17:49.911 --> 17:53.105
First off, man, the kids deserve
to meet they grandmother.

17:53.130 --> 17:54.341
- I know.
- Okay?

17:54.701 --> 17:57.858
Okay, you can't punish them
for what happened years ago.

17:57.883 --> 17:59.951
- Right.
- Can't change nothin' back there.

17:59.952 --> 18:03.527
Okay, havin' they grandmother
is a plus in them kids' life.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.691
Yeah, that's... I mean,
that's true, you know?

18:06.692 --> 18:08.757
A few days ago, they
didn't know she existed,

18:08.782 --> 18:09.782
and they were fine.

18:09.807 --> 18:11.814
- Yeah, that's true.
- Admit it, Shay...

18:11.839 --> 18:13.386
keeping the kids from they grandmother

18:13.411 --> 18:16.402
is just another way of punishing
Tray for what he did to you.

18:16.427 --> 18:17.902
Yeah, I guess if you...

18:17.927 --> 18:19.213
if you really wanted to punish Tray,

18:19.237 --> 18:20.771
you would ask for back child support,

18:20.772 --> 18:22.369
so maybe that's not what this is about.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.758
That's... I didn't think of that.

18:23.783 --> 18:25.182
Bottom line is,

18:25.642 --> 18:27.194
what's the worst that could happen

18:27.219 --> 18:30.561
by letting Roberta have a
relationship with the kids?

18:30.586 --> 18:32.651
Yeah, I guess I didn't
think of that, either.

18:32.652 --> 18:34.181
But you know what I just realized?

18:34.206 --> 18:36.228
All these examples that you gave

18:36.253 --> 18:37.992
for getting to know them and leaving,

18:38.017 --> 18:39.767
her being a bad moral influence,

18:39.792 --> 18:42.696
her making promises
and not keeping them,

18:42.983 --> 18:45.912
those are all things your mother did.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.961
You don't know shit.

18:47.986 --> 18:51.609
Maybe this isn't as much about
Tray and Roberta as it seems.

18:51.634 --> 18:52.763
Maybe...

18:53.292 --> 18:55.561
Maybe you're still dealing
with some anger at Ruth.

18:59.142 --> 19:01.011
We're going to go get the kids.

19:05.374 --> 19:08.621
Oh, I had such a good
time with both of you.

19:08.622 --> 19:10.221
- Mwah!
- We did, too.

19:10.222 --> 19:11.751
Oh, wait! Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

19:12.635 --> 19:14.421
Oh, you don't have to do that.

19:14.422 --> 19:16.691
Listen, just remember that
our birthday is in June.

19:17.092 --> 19:18.231
It's a deal.

19:18.232 --> 19:20.492
What? What'd you stop her for?

19:20.502 --> 19:22.522
I saw a couple hundreds in there.

19:22.547 --> 19:25.675
- Stop being so greedy, Shahzad.
- Josh, thank you.

19:36.424 --> 19:37.623
I can't believe you asked her

19:37.648 --> 19:39.051
if there's a history of diabetes

19:39.052 --> 19:40.251
on her side of the family.

19:40.252 --> 19:41.789
Look, I've been wearing glasses

19:41.814 --> 19:43.283
since I was 2 years old.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.307
I don't want any more genetic surprises.

19:45.332 --> 19:46.536
What about that stuff she said about

19:46.560 --> 19:48.258
Tray being good at math
when he was a kid?

19:48.283 --> 19:49.861
- I know!
- How crazy is that?

19:49.862 --> 19:52.061
She even has the old
report cards to prove it.

19:52.062 --> 19:53.918
- His middle name is Leviticus!
- Leviticus.

19:55.022 --> 19:56.353
And don't forget she said she'd make us

19:56.377 --> 19:59.206
- her collard greens next time.
- Yeah.

20:01.388 --> 20:03.588
Did she say what she puts in her greens?

20:03.613 --> 20:05.472
- No.
- She told me her foot.

20:05.657 --> 20:07.325
Don't you use that, Mom?

20:07.350 --> 20:09.927
- What's that mean?
- You put your soul in it.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.581
Love is patient.

20:16.994 --> 20:18.057
It is kind.

20:19.092 --> 20:24.515
So, open your Bibles
to 1 Corinthians 13:4.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.467
You'll see it says, "Love is patient.

20:29.016 --> 20:30.615
Love is kind.

20:31.248 --> 20:32.588
It does not envy.

20:33.282 --> 20:34.826
It does not boast.

20:35.405 --> 20:37.334
It is not proud".

20:39.702 --> 20:45.471
"And now we three
remain... faith, hope, and love.

20:46.052 --> 20:49.851
But of the greatest of these is love".

20:50.426 --> 20:51.525
Amen.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.949
Amen.
