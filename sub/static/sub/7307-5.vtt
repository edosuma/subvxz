WEBVTT

00:09.859 --> 00:11.022
Shoot.

01:40.424 --> 01:41.503
Grab your gear.

01:42.051 --> 01:44.542
- My three favourite words.
- Where to?

01:45.721 --> 01:47.879
St. Mary's River State Park.

01:49.349 --> 01:50.429
Right here.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.266
- Maryland.
- Good guess.

01:53.353 --> 01:54.931
Think you can guess how to drive there?

01:55.105 --> 01:58.605
I'd say the fastest way would be to take
the beltway to Highway 235 south,

01:58.692 --> 02:01.064
take that to Route 50 and then

02:01.153 --> 02:03.561
punch it into the nav system
when we get lost.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.403
What's in the park?

02:06.575 --> 02:08.947
A deer hunter who stumbled on to
an aircraft drop tank.

02:09.036 --> 02:10.115
Navy markings.

02:10.204 --> 02:12.098
We're driving to Maryland to look
at a drop tank?

02:12.122 --> 02:13.498
It's got a body inside.

02:13.582 --> 02:15.740
- Now, that's different.
- Yeah, I thought so.

02:16.043 --> 02:17.122
You pick up Ducky.

02:17.211 --> 02:18.539
Tony, you gas the truck.

02:18.879 --> 02:21.666
Gibbs, you know, most agencies
have people who do that sort of thing.

02:21.799 --> 02:23.079
So do we.

02:37.397 --> 02:40.731
Bow hunter was tracking a deer,
stumbled across the drop tank.

02:41.443 --> 02:44.017
- He's the one who opened the hatch?
- That's right.

02:57.501 --> 03:02.079
- How did he get so...
- I believe "mummified"

03:02.172 --> 03:04.580
is the adjective you're searching for.

03:04.925 --> 03:08.590
Now, the tank must have been airtight

03:08.762 --> 03:11.336
creating a hermetic environment.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.928
No air, no bugs, no critters.

03:15.102 --> 03:19.515
- And more important, no bacteria.
- Got an estimated time of death, Duck?

03:19.690 --> 03:21.314
Very amusing, Jethro.

03:23.652 --> 03:27.270
I thought it was a missile or a bomb
of some kind until I tapped it.

03:27.364 --> 03:28.443
It sounded hollow,

03:28.532 --> 03:30.857
so I cleared some leaves away
and found the hatch.

03:31.785 --> 03:34.572
- Your curiosity got the best of you?
- Wouldn't yours?

03:35.455 --> 03:37.662
Yeah, you know what,
it probably would have.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.373
- Did you remove the flight bag?
- Yeah.

03:40.878 --> 03:43.582
- Touch anything else?
- Not after I saw King Tut.

03:45.048 --> 03:46.424
Well, we'll need your prints,

03:46.508 --> 03:48.916
separate them from any others we find
on the tank.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.209
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.513
"Lieutenant Commander Farnsworth."

03:54.641 --> 03:56.883
- Think he's our mummy?
- I don't know. Bag it.

03:56.977 --> 04:00.761
No, I can't do anything for this
gentleman until we cut him out of here.

04:01.106 --> 04:02.517
I know what this is, boss.

04:04.359 --> 04:06.067
External fuel tank?

04:06.445 --> 04:10.359
Three hundred and seventy gallon
external fuel tank off an F-14 Tomcat.

04:10.449 --> 04:13.615
A few were converted into camera
or cargo pods. This one's a cargo pod.

04:14.244 --> 04:15.489
I'm impressed.

04:15.579 --> 04:18.331
Didn't become an NCIS agent
yesterday, Kate.

04:18.457 --> 04:21.623
- As a matter of fact, tomorrow is...
- It'll have been two years.

04:22.252 --> 04:25.787
That's kind of touching, Gibbs,
remembering the day you hired me.

04:25.964 --> 04:28.502
Yeah, well, seemed like a good idea
at the time.

04:28.592 --> 04:31.462
- Duck, is it okay if I touch?
- By all means.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.808
Our sailor is a lieutenant.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.641
- Flight bag's not his.
- See his dog tags?

04:44.483 --> 04:45.562
Nope.

04:46.735 --> 04:47.898
Get a flatbed.

04:47.986 --> 04:51.272
Take our Lieutenant and his pod
back home with us.

04:55.244 --> 04:59.111
Let me guess. You're gonna suggest
I ride back in the flatbed with the driver.

04:59.957 --> 05:01.285
Wasn't a suggestion.

05:14.763 --> 05:17.219
Abby, find any prints on there
beside the hunter's?

05:17.391 --> 05:20.261
I pulled some partials off
the inside of the hatch that weren't his.

05:20.435 --> 05:22.143
- Victim's?
- I doubt it.

05:22.229 --> 05:23.972
Mummies aren't generally
the self-help type.

05:24.064 --> 05:26.042
Let's run the prints
through the military database.

05:26.066 --> 05:28.853
You got it. And there's a serial number
on the underside of the tank.

05:28.944 --> 05:31.316
The paint's kind of worn off,
but I can bring it up.

05:31.405 --> 05:35.449
Good. If that tank came off a Tomcat,
somebody filed a TFOA report.

05:35.534 --> 05:36.565
TFOA?

05:36.660 --> 05:38.985
- "Things falling off aircraft."
- You're kidding.

05:39.079 --> 05:40.390
Nope, that's what they're called.

05:40.414 --> 05:43.118
Squadrons have kept files on those,
going back to biplanes.

05:44.459 --> 05:46.037
- All right.
- Come on.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.629
Okay, on three. One, two...

05:56.221 --> 05:57.715
Sailor on a half-shell.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.762
- Abby, please.
- Sorry.

06:02.227 --> 06:04.800
It's not unlike the Egyptians, however.

06:04.896 --> 06:07.981
Their mummified dead
were buried along with

06:08.066 --> 06:12.278
personal treasures to accompany them
on the journey to the afterlife.

06:12.404 --> 06:14.361
Where he could squeeze in 18
now and then.

06:14.448 --> 06:15.990
He's not wearing shoes.

06:16.074 --> 06:17.616
I kick mine off when I fly.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.159
- We got an ID.
- Lieutenant Mark Schilz.

06:26.251 --> 06:29.834
He's not a golfer.
This bag belongs to Lieutenant Lynch.

06:29.921 --> 06:31.332
Gold wedding band.

06:31.423 --> 06:34.210
Looks like Lieutenant Schilz
left someone behind.

06:35.510 --> 06:38.345
Okay, we got a name,
we got a serial number,

06:38.430 --> 06:40.802
TFOA'll find the plane
and the squadron.

06:40.891 --> 06:43.892
And we'll crack the secret
of the mummy's curse in no time!

06:44.686 --> 06:47.177
- Abby.
- What?

06:47.856 --> 06:49.516
Lieutenant Schilz's service record.

06:49.608 --> 06:52.443
He was reported missing
at sea off the Eisenhower.

06:52.527 --> 06:56.146
- Amend it. He's no longer missing.
- The carrier was a day out of Norfolk

06:56.239 --> 06:58.647
at the end of a six-month
deployment in the Med.

06:58.742 --> 07:01.363
- When?
- March 4, 1994.

07:01.453 --> 07:03.611
He was declared a deserter
30 days later

07:03.705 --> 07:05.745
and he received
a dishonourable discharge.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.078
Dishonourable?

07:07.167 --> 07:09.325
Lieutenant Schilz was charged
in absentia

07:09.419 --> 07:10.878
with theft of government property.

07:12.297 --> 07:13.839
The cargo pod.

07:14.549 --> 07:17.384
$1.2 million out of
the Eisenhower's safe.

07:17.677 --> 07:19.421
He was their Disbursing Officer.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.677
I just spent three riveting hours

07:22.766 --> 07:25.387
sorting through squadron records
at the safety centre.

07:25.477 --> 07:27.719
Found the aircraft that dropped the pod.

07:27.813 --> 07:29.058
An F-14 Tomcat.

07:29.147 --> 07:30.974
From a squadron on the Eisenhower?

07:32.025 --> 07:35.560
Yeah. VF-212. The Red Wolves.

07:36.154 --> 07:38.028
Coming home from a deployment?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.734
After six months in the Med.

07:39.825 --> 07:41.948
Wanna give me the names
of the Tomcat crew?

07:42.035 --> 07:44.472
Well, it's safe to assume one of them
wasn't Lieutenant Schilz.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.576
Why ride in a pod
when you got a seat in the cockpit?

07:46.665 --> 07:48.788
Pilot was
Lieutenant Commander Farnsworth.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.204
Yeah, good news, Commander.

07:50.293 --> 07:53.045
It took 10 years,
but we located your luggage.

07:53.130 --> 07:56.380
The golf clubs belong to his RIO,
Lieutenant Lynch.

07:56.716 --> 07:57.748
RIO?

07:57.843 --> 08:00.131
Radar Intercept Officer.
Also called a GIBS, one "B."

08:00.220 --> 08:03.304
- Short for "Guy in Back."
- Why do you need two "B's"?

08:03.390 --> 08:05.382
Second one's for "bastard."
What else, Tony?

08:05.475 --> 08:07.931
VF-212 flew off
the Eisenhower for Pax River

08:08.019 --> 08:09.562
the day before she docked at Norfolk.

08:09.646 --> 08:10.725
"She"?

08:10.814 --> 08:13.731
Tony, it's named after Dwight
David Eisenhower for God's sake.

08:13.817 --> 08:15.359
Maybe, she was named for Mamie.

08:15.694 --> 08:18.481
Their flight path took them over
lower Maryland.

08:18.572 --> 08:21.608
Where the Tomcat lost
an external cargo pod.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.156
No one on the ground
reported being whacked in the head,

08:24.244 --> 08:27.079
so the Navy conducted
a cursory search and wrote it off.

08:27.247 --> 08:29.156
This was in the spring of '94?

08:30.417 --> 08:31.662
No.

08:32.794 --> 08:35.546
Abby estimated how long
the pod's been in the ground, right?

08:35.630 --> 08:36.710
No.

08:37.048 --> 08:40.749
Ducky calculated the time
it took Lieutenant Schilz to mummify?

08:41.260 --> 08:42.340
No.

08:42.471 --> 08:43.585
Okay.

08:44.097 --> 08:45.508
How do you know the date?

08:46.057 --> 08:48.097
I pulled Lieutenant Schilz's
service record.

08:48.185 --> 08:51.102
- You took the easy way.
- Yeah, not so easy.

08:51.188 --> 08:54.521
Our mummified lieutenant went UA
with $1.2 million.

08:54.608 --> 08:57.525
He was the Disbursing Officer
on the Eisenhower.

08:57.694 --> 08:58.857
Our mummy's a crook.

08:58.945 --> 09:00.819
Who tried to make his getaway
in a cargo pod.

09:00.906 --> 09:04.275
I doubt it. Air's cold and thin
at 30,000 feet. He'd know that.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.743
Where's the money?

09:05.827 --> 09:08.365
It's not in the pod
or Abby'd be up here screaming "Lotto."

09:08.455 --> 09:10.578
According to his service record,
it was never found.

09:10.665 --> 09:12.575
Tony, pull our files on the investigation

09:12.667 --> 09:14.577
since you're such an expert
at looking up names.

09:14.669 --> 09:15.813
I wouldn't say I'm an expert.

09:15.837 --> 09:16.957
If he's still working for us

09:17.005 --> 09:20.421
I wanna talk to the on board NCIS
special agent in '94.

09:20.509 --> 09:22.382
- What if he's not with us?
- I wanna talk to

09:22.469 --> 09:24.924
the on board NCIS special agent in '94.

09:25.013 --> 09:27.158
- Our mummy had a wedding ring.
- And a wife to go with it.

09:27.182 --> 09:29.258
- Got a current address?
- Not yet.

09:29.601 --> 09:34.559
The deceased is a Caucasian male,
20 to 25, approximately 5'7".

09:34.648 --> 09:37.898
The facial bone structure
indicates Nordic descent.

09:39.778 --> 09:41.984
It matches
Lieutenant Schilz's description.

09:42.072 --> 09:45.357
Commissioned before the DNA
database was initiated.

09:46.993 --> 09:50.611
Oh. Well, young man,
we'll have to match your smile.

09:50.705 --> 09:52.947
You know, the Lieutenant was in
remarkable condition,

09:53.041 --> 09:54.749
given the precipitous fall.

09:55.085 --> 09:57.291
The jaw was broken, fractured.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.956
Post-mortem, no sign of bleeding.

10:01.091 --> 10:04.923
The injury is consistent with a nine-iron
or possibly a sand wedge.

10:05.011 --> 10:07.965
Definitely one of the lofted clubs
he flew with.

10:08.056 --> 10:11.472
Ducky, I'm not interested
in what happened to him after he died.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.133
I'm surprised
to hear you say that, Gibbs.

10:14.229 --> 10:17.183
You know post-mortem details
can be extremely revealing.

10:17.274 --> 10:19.562
Remember that case four years ago,

10:19.651 --> 10:23.020
where the young marine was buried
in an anthill up to his neck?

10:23.113 --> 10:24.524
Duck, eight years ago.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.687
How did he die?

10:27.033 --> 10:30.319
Well, it can't be eight years.
No, I know it wasn't!

10:30.453 --> 10:34.119
Four years ago, your third wife hit you
over the head with a baseball bat.

10:34.207 --> 10:36.330
And I distinctly remember
the ant-eaten marine

10:36.418 --> 10:38.375
on that table there
when I stitched you up.

10:38.461 --> 10:41.913
Ducky, how did
our young Lieutenant die?

10:42.132 --> 10:44.290
You know, I think the poor fellow
bled out.

10:44.384 --> 10:46.590
I made a minimal incision
in the chest cavity

10:46.678 --> 10:50.806
and came across evidence
of massive internal haemorrhaging.

10:50.890 --> 10:52.634
- From?
- I don't know yet.

10:52.726 --> 10:56.640
But something quite small
must have punctured the chest cavity.

10:56.855 --> 11:00.105
Yes, I'll need to send the poor boy
for a CAT scan to get a proper look.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.211
Couldn't have happened
when he augered in, in the pod?

11:02.235 --> 11:06.482
No! As I told you, the fracture to the jaw
was post-mortem,

11:06.573 --> 11:08.945
obviously inflicted by the crash.

11:09.034 --> 11:12.319
This amount of bleeding
could only occur when he was alive.

11:12.662 --> 11:14.821
Which means that Lieutenant Schilz
was murdered

11:14.914 --> 11:16.706
and then stuffed in the pod.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.325
Yes. Yes, I suppose it does.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.963
Gotta be decaf.

11:31.006 --> 11:33.213
- What?
- That coffee you drink.

11:34.343 --> 11:36.668
- High test.
- Don't you twitch?

11:38.097 --> 11:40.303
Nope.

11:41.851 --> 11:45.136
- How's it coming?
- Still no address.

11:45.229 --> 11:46.427
You know,

11:46.522 --> 11:50.021
if Lieutenant Schilz stole the money,
he didn't do it alone.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.307
Why do you say that?

11:51.527 --> 11:53.934
Someone murdered him
and stuffed him in the pod.

11:54.530 --> 11:58.029
Maybe an accomplice
didn't wanna share the $1.2 million.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.240
Couldn't he have surprised the thief

12:00.327 --> 12:02.071
in the disbursing office
and been murdered?

12:02.162 --> 12:04.700
Well, no. Then someone would have to
carry the body from there

12:04.790 --> 12:06.533
to the cargo pod without being seen.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.792
No easy thing to do
on a ship with 6,000 souls.

12:09.879 --> 12:12.796
Oh, I found Lieutenant Schilz's widow.

12:12.882 --> 12:16.464
- She's remarried and living in Arlington.
- Well, go get her.

12:20.514 --> 12:23.219
- Was it something I said?
- Not yet.

12:26.562 --> 12:27.676
Well,

12:28.606 --> 12:30.729
looks like we're gonna
have to go to Hawaii, boss.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.476
Now, it's what you said.

12:32.568 --> 12:34.893
NCIS special agent afloat,
Richard Owens

12:34.987 --> 12:36.565
investigated the robbery in '94.

12:36.655 --> 12:40.570
He's currently assigned
to NCIS, Pearl Harbour.

12:43.037 --> 12:44.556
Or we could always use
video conferencing.

12:44.580 --> 12:45.659
You know Owens?

12:45.748 --> 12:47.206
- No.
- Didn't think you would.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.999
He's considerably younger than you are.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.911
What would you consider considerably?

12:52.004 --> 12:53.831
Well, the guy was young, Gibbs.

12:54.089 --> 12:56.545
Only 28. Makes him 37 now.

12:56.634 --> 12:59.800
Then considerably would not be
an accurate description.

13:00.012 --> 13:03.132
- I didn't realise, boss. How old are you?
- Doesn't matter how old I am.

13:03.223 --> 13:05.327
Well, it does actually.
'Cause it gives me a reference point

13:05.351 --> 13:07.889
- for the word that you're...
- Can I see the file?

13:19.698 --> 13:22.403
Yeah, after 40 everybody's eyes,
you know...

13:23.577 --> 13:28.488
Night of the robbery,
there was a report of a man overboard.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.669
"Aft watch spotted

13:32.753 --> 13:35.920
"a life vest beacon in the carrier wake."

13:36.090 --> 13:37.817
You're embarrassed to tell me
how old you are.

13:37.841 --> 13:39.170
Not at all.

13:39.843 --> 13:41.883
"Schilz's shoes were found

13:42.304 --> 13:44.926
"in the hold full of scrapped life vests."

13:45.015 --> 13:47.589
Yeah, Navy presumed
that he robbed the disbursing office,

13:47.685 --> 13:49.891
faked falling overboard
and then sat tight with the cash

13:49.979 --> 13:51.770
until the carrier put in to Norfolk.

13:51.855 --> 13:54.097
They based all this
on finding his shoes in the hold?

13:54.191 --> 13:56.184
Well, maybe the Navy read
Agent Owens' notes.

13:56.276 --> 13:58.352
They're attached to the back of the file.

14:06.203 --> 14:09.323
"Lieutenant Schilz
must have eluded the night watch

14:09.456 --> 14:13.240
"and slipped over the side
without his shoes to swim ashore."

14:18.882 --> 14:20.258
Eye strain.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.500
Losing Mark at sea was bad enough,

14:24.596 --> 14:28.048
but to have him accused
of stealing money.

14:28.559 --> 14:31.097
I'm sorry.
I realise this is opening old wounds.

14:31.186 --> 14:35.765
No, at least finding his body
will end the vicious gossip.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.443
There was a rumour
that he had started a new life

14:39.528 --> 14:42.197
with the money and a new woman.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.608
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.113
Was there any basis for it?

14:50.789 --> 14:52.616
We'd only been married a year,

14:52.708 --> 14:55.709
and six months of that
he was at sea, Agent Todd.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.083
- Well, it doesn't sound likely, does it?
- No.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.455
No more likely than his being a thief.

15:02.051 --> 15:05.965
Mark was a good man.
He loved the Navy.

15:06.847 --> 15:09.005
Even if it didn't love him back.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.097
But that'll change now, won't it?

15:12.644 --> 15:14.269
He'll be exonerated.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.852
We have reopened the investigation.

15:19.193 --> 15:21.150
But it seems so obvious.

15:21.612 --> 15:24.150
Whoever took the money
murdered Mark.

15:24.656 --> 15:26.316
That's a very real possibility.

15:27.034 --> 15:29.323
He wouldn't have even been in that tank

15:29.411 --> 15:31.071
unless someone put him there.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.576
So, you're remarried.

15:36.376 --> 15:40.505
Yes. After six years,
I had Mark declared dead.

15:40.589 --> 15:42.665
Randy helped me move on.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.218
Navy didn't even send a flag
for his memorial service.

15:46.553 --> 15:50.421
- That seems rather harsh.
- I could have done without the flag,

15:50.516 --> 15:54.596
but not to receive
death benefits or child support,

15:54.686 --> 15:56.181
that was harsh.

15:57.147 --> 15:58.641
You haven't gotten anything?

15:58.732 --> 16:02.267
Flags and benefits
are only for the honourably discharged.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.322
You haven't been in the Navy very long,
have you?

16:06.657 --> 16:07.985
I'm still not.

16:08.075 --> 16:10.862
As I told you,
I'm an NCIS special agent.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.827
I've been that for only a month.

16:13.997 --> 16:18.494
I don't care for myself.
Randy and I get by,

16:18.585 --> 16:23.331
but if you clear Mark's name,
Alicia will benefit.

16:23.841 --> 16:25.501
She'll have a better life.

16:25.843 --> 16:28.512
- Money for college.
- She's beautiful.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.591
Mark never saw her.

16:32.641 --> 16:35.512
He called, though,
the morning she was born.

16:36.436 --> 16:40.386
I held the phone to her ear
so she could hear her daddy's voice.

16:40.649 --> 16:44.777
- He called you from the carrier?
- Yeah. No, it wasn't easy then.

16:44.945 --> 16:46.570
I don't know how he did it

16:47.364 --> 16:51.196
but somehow Mark got a call to me
in Bethesda early in the morning.

16:51.702 --> 16:54.193
That was the last time
I ever heard his voice.

16:54.538 --> 16:57.159
- The day your daughter was born?
- Yeah.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.409
And the day Mark disappeared.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.920
I would have never guessed
he flew off that ship.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.998
I don't think it was his idea.

17:06.508 --> 17:08.964
I was sure he swum ashore
with the cash.

17:09.051 --> 17:12.303
That damn case has been the
only blotch on my record for 12 years.

17:13.807 --> 17:16.808
Didn't do much for
Lieutenant Schilz's record, either.

17:16.894 --> 17:19.515
Hey, he stole the money.
I'll stand by that.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.689
Well, if he stole it, Agent Owens,
where is it?

17:22.900 --> 17:24.857
Beats me, but it's not on that ship.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.351
We searched every inch of it
for him and the cash.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.731
The Eisenhower docked the next day.
How long did you search?

17:32.159 --> 17:33.902
- I don't remember.
- Two days.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.033
Who searched?

17:37.122 --> 17:38.664
Hell, the entire crew.

17:38.749 --> 17:40.706
Finders keepers? Treasure hunt?

17:43.045 --> 17:44.325
What are you implying, Gibbs?

17:44.421 --> 17:47.671
Nothing. I'm just wondering
how you managed to search

17:47.758 --> 17:51.542
every inch of a 95,000 ton,
24-storey tall,

17:51.637 --> 17:55.966
1,049 foot-long aircraft carrier
in two days.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.181
We couldn't keep the crew
any longer than that.

17:58.268 --> 17:59.762
They'd been deployed for six months.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.645
Their families were waiting dockside.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.972
Which means
you didn't search every inch.

18:04.066 --> 18:07.399
So, as far as you know,
that money could still be on board.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.897
It could be, but it isn't.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.395
Another assumption,
Special Agent Owens?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.949
Or do you know this as fact?

18:13.033 --> 18:14.611
I don't like the tone of this.

18:15.035 --> 18:16.363
You've got my report.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.239
I have nothing more to tell you.

18:19.706 --> 18:21.533
Okay. We'll see.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.793
The Eisenhower is currently
doing quals in the Atlantic.

18:24.878 --> 18:27.452
She'll be back in Norfolk
for weekend liberty.

18:27.547 --> 18:30.299
Be there. 0700, Saturday.

18:31.051 --> 18:33.044
You cannot order me back to that...

18:33.512 --> 18:36.548
- How did you know those statistics?
- Read them.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.964
You put it back together.

18:40.060 --> 18:43.559
Yeah. I had to study the
fibreglass sarcophagus in one piece.

18:43.647 --> 18:46.102
- What did you find?
- Something hinky.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.682
Okay, the pod is attached
to the Tomcat

18:48.777 --> 18:50.734
by an MXU rack with two hooks.

18:51.738 --> 18:52.901
It's here and here.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.407
Wasn't sure you could see them, boss.

18:57.786 --> 19:01.202
- Go on.
- The hooks fit in these holes.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.781
Now, when the pilot
wants to eject the pod,

19:03.875 --> 19:05.998
he flips a switch, the hooks disengage.

19:06.086 --> 19:09.420
- And the pod drops away.
- Well, actually, it's kicked away.

19:09.506 --> 19:12.590
The forward and aft ejectors fire
and kick it off the wing.

19:12.676 --> 19:15.593
TFOA report said the pilot didn't
touch the pod ejector switch.

19:15.679 --> 19:17.387
The pod just fell away. Was he lying?

19:17.472 --> 19:19.346
No. If he had popped it,

19:19.433 --> 19:21.758
the ejectors would have made dents
in the pod.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.468
No. No dents.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.314
No dents. Just damage from ploughing
into mother earth.

19:28.191 --> 19:30.018
You know, when you think about it,

19:30.610 --> 19:32.852
if the lieutenant was still alive,

19:32.946 --> 19:34.773
that would have been one hell of a ride.

19:39.661 --> 19:40.906
Well, it would.

19:41.997 --> 19:44.452
Oh, just figuring that out now?

19:44.624 --> 19:46.866
You know,
it's not polite to talk with your hands.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.620
Gibbs, come look at these holes.

19:53.175 --> 19:55.251
Yeah. Top of the hole's damaged.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.793
This one, too.

19:57.888 --> 19:59.382
To remove a pod on deck,

19:59.473 --> 20:01.928
you insert a key into the MXU rack
and turn it.

20:02.017 --> 20:06.478
That withdraws the hooks.
Now, if you turn the key only until

20:06.563 --> 20:09.766
the tips of the hooks
are holding onto the pod, then...

20:09.858 --> 20:13.192
It should tear loose on the cat shot
and leave marks like these on the holes.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.734
Except, the mummy's curse
was working,

20:15.822 --> 20:18.194
so the tips held on to the pod
until it was over Maryland.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.362
I got it.

20:19.451 --> 20:20.845
Abby, there was no mummy
10 years ago,

20:20.869 --> 20:22.411
so how could there be a curse?

20:22.496 --> 20:24.821
It's like a chicken and egg thing, Tony.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.993
I interviewed Lieutenant Schilz's widow.
They had a child, Alicia.

20:30.087 --> 20:31.927
Nine years old,
and she's as pretty as her mom.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.837
I knew I should have taken
that interview.

20:33.924 --> 20:36.082
- She's remarried, Tony.
- Yeah?

20:36.176 --> 20:38.169
He does this just to screw with me,
don't you?

20:38.261 --> 20:40.420
Do you have a report to make,
Agent Todd?

20:40.514 --> 20:43.965
Mary got a call from her first husband
the day he disappeared.

20:44.059 --> 20:46.348
She'd just given birth
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital,

20:46.436 --> 20:48.393
and he called her from the carrier.

20:48.563 --> 20:49.595
So?

20:49.689 --> 20:51.848
So, it was a big deal to call home
from a ship in '94.

20:51.942 --> 20:53.566
The signal was bounced off a satellite

20:53.652 --> 20:55.452
and routed through the comm office
in Norfolk.

20:55.529 --> 20:58.289
- You traced the time of the call?
- Navy doesn't get rid of anything.

20:58.365 --> 21:00.357
Comm office records show
that a Lieutenant Schilz

21:00.534 --> 21:04.531
called Bethesda Naval Hospital
from CVN-69, that's the Eisenhower,

21:04.621 --> 21:09.532
at 0533 on the fourth of March, 1994,
and the call lasted 12 minutes.

21:09.626 --> 21:11.251
Tony, what time
did the schmuck's report

21:11.336 --> 21:13.245
say the disbursing office was robbed?

21:13.338 --> 21:15.876
- What schmuck?
- Our schmuck, unfortunately.

21:15.966 --> 21:19.085
Between 2100 hours, March 3,
when the office was secured,

21:19.177 --> 21:20.885
and 0700 on the fourth,

21:20.971 --> 21:23.462
when it was opened
by the Assistant Disbursing Officer.

21:23.557 --> 21:24.885
Doesn't let him off the hook.

21:24.975 --> 21:26.350
Ensign Wiles.

21:27.144 --> 21:29.432
Wiles? Randy Wiles?

21:30.856 --> 21:34.106
No, you're not getting me to bite again.
You read this report.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.185
No, Mrs Schilz told you.

21:36.445 --> 21:38.402
- Actually, she did.
- I knew it.

21:38.488 --> 21:42.735
Only she didn't tell me that Randy Wiles
was the Assistant Disbursing Officer.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.826
She said he was her husband.

21:56.597 --> 21:59.349
This is why I jumped at being stationed
at Pearl.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.225
It's only November, and I'm freezing.

22:01.310 --> 22:03.801
- I hate Norfolk.
- Could be Bremerton.

22:05.022 --> 22:06.766
All right, where the hell is he?

22:07.275 --> 22:10.145
I didn't fly standby
and sit next to a toilet for 12 hours

22:10.236 --> 22:11.944
to freeze my ass off waiting.

22:12.029 --> 22:13.488
First class toilet?

22:15.408 --> 22:16.487
Sorry.

22:16.575 --> 22:18.449
Talking to me like
I'm some kind of newbie.

22:18.536 --> 22:20.908
Who the hell
does this Gibbs think he is, anyway?

22:21.205 --> 22:23.005
Ten years,
and this case is still haunting me.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.867
It's like I'm cursed.

22:27.295 --> 22:28.457
What? What's funny?

22:28.546 --> 22:30.123
Our lab tech believes there's a curse.

22:30.214 --> 22:31.377
But she's a Goth, you know,

22:31.465 --> 22:34.466
with the chains and the tats
and the piercing.

22:34.802 --> 22:37.210
And you're so...

22:38.556 --> 22:40.299
How old do you think Gibbs is?

22:42.310 --> 22:43.555
Pull!

22:45.313 --> 22:46.511
Very nice.

22:47.315 --> 22:51.015
- Very nice.
- Thanks. You here to shoot?

22:51.319 --> 22:55.233
I hope not. I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

22:55.323 --> 22:59.735
This is Special Agent Todd, NCIS.
Lady inside said you're the manager.

22:59.869 --> 23:01.280
Randy Wiles?

23:02.496 --> 23:04.655
Formerly Ensign Randy Wiles.

23:06.834 --> 23:07.997
I saw on the news.

23:08.085 --> 23:11.170
If you're here to talk about Mark,
I told you guys all I know years ago.

23:11.255 --> 23:13.461
You didn't say
you were gonna marry his wife.

23:19.388 --> 23:21.511
- You talked to Mary?
- I did.

23:21.974 --> 23:23.535
And funny thing,
she never once mentioned

23:23.559 --> 23:25.184
marrying her husband's shipmate.

23:25.978 --> 23:28.350
She doesn't know
that Mark and I served together.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.317
How could she not know?

23:36.530 --> 23:38.440
We met at Mark's memorial service.

23:38.532 --> 23:39.612
What did you say?

23:39.700 --> 23:42.737
"I was passing by, dug the music,
decided to drop in"?

23:44.538 --> 23:46.864
Something pretty close to that.

23:46.957 --> 23:49.080
I was afraid that
if I told her I knew Mark,

23:49.168 --> 23:50.793
she'd ask a lot of questions.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.206
I didn't think I'd fall in love with her.

23:54.298 --> 23:56.540
And then when I did, it was too late.

23:56.634 --> 23:57.665
Bounce.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.333
Yeah.

23:59.428 --> 24:01.088
- Bounce?
- It's a film.

24:01.806 --> 24:04.676
Ben Affleck gives up his seat
on this flight

24:04.767 --> 24:06.345
for a guy who needs to get home.

24:06.435 --> 24:08.392
Plane crashes, guy dies.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.727
He looks up the widow,
Gwyneth Paltrow.

24:10.815 --> 24:11.958
He means to tell her the story,

24:11.982 --> 24:14.461
but by the time they come around to it,
they've fallen in love,

24:14.485 --> 24:16.810
and he's afraid if he
tells her, it'll ruin it.

24:16.904 --> 24:18.232
That's what happened to me.

24:20.366 --> 24:21.564
I believe him.

24:22.284 --> 24:24.610
Of course, you believe him,
it's a chick flick.

24:24.745 --> 24:26.702
In a guy flick, you steal the money

24:26.789 --> 24:28.912
you set Lieutenant Schilz up
to take the fall,

24:28.999 --> 24:30.743
you murder him and you marry his wife.

24:30.835 --> 24:33.041
- That is sick.
- It sure is.

24:33.712 --> 24:36.464
Agent Todd, you will realise
after being here more than a month,

24:36.549 --> 24:38.588
that there are a lot
of sick people in the world.

24:38.676 --> 24:40.218
Are you one of those, Randy?

24:40.428 --> 24:41.886
This is my day job.

24:42.388 --> 24:44.713
At night, I do freelance accounting.

24:44.807 --> 24:48.176
Mary and I rent a house.
Alicia goes to public school.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.095
I drive a 6-year-old Saturn.

24:50.312 --> 24:53.183
Now, do you think I'd live like that
if I had a million bucks?

24:55.317 --> 24:57.643
Yeah, you're right,
you were doing better in the Navy.

24:57.736 --> 25:00.227
No. Navy cleared me,
doesn't mean they trusted me.

25:00.322 --> 25:02.813
Your disbursing clerk,
Petty Officer Toner,

25:03.576 --> 25:05.901
she left the Navy, too.
They pass her over?

25:05.995 --> 25:08.568
Erin enlisted to catch an officer.

25:09.623 --> 25:12.494
Petty Officer Toner was a hottie,
if you know what I mean.

25:12.585 --> 25:14.624
Oh, yeah?
Did you investigate this hottie?

25:14.712 --> 25:15.791
It's in my report.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.561
So is the assumption
that Lieutenant Schilz

25:17.631 --> 25:19.957
left his shoes on board
so he could swim ashore.

25:20.384 --> 25:21.665
That's not in my report.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.343
No, that was in your attached notes.

25:24.722 --> 25:26.722
I didn't think the Navy
was gonna look at my notes.

25:26.807 --> 25:28.930
You didn't think
about anything except getting ashore.

25:29.018 --> 25:30.049
That's not fair, Gibbs.

25:30.144 --> 25:33.679
Neither is convicting a man in absentia
for a sloppy investigation.

25:33.772 --> 25:36.001
Lieutenant Schilz was the only one
who could have done it.

25:36.025 --> 25:39.144
Wiles was in an all-night poker game,
and Erin was already in her quarters.

25:39.236 --> 25:40.267
How do you know?

25:40.362 --> 25:42.984
That cruise was the first time
females were deployed at sea.

25:43.073 --> 25:46.240
If they weren't in chow or at work,
they were in female country.

25:46.410 --> 25:49.744
The Navy ran that area
like it was a sorority. No men allowed.

25:49.830 --> 25:52.617
I'll bet you all you did
was take her word.

25:52.791 --> 25:56.077
How many women got pregnant
on that cruise, Special Agent Owens?

25:56.170 --> 25:57.878
Quite a few, Agent.

25:57.963 --> 26:00.585
Guess the house mothers
weren't on top of the log book.

26:00.799 --> 26:01.831
Gibbs.

26:01.926 --> 26:04.167
Lieutenant Commander Farnsworth
and Ensign Lynch

26:04.261 --> 26:06.420
died in a ramp strike two years ago.

26:06.514 --> 26:09.005
I won't say it sounds like Abby's
curse of the mummy, but...

26:09.099 --> 26:11.139
Well, if they were still
in the Navy two years ago,

26:11.227 --> 26:13.634
we can cross them off our list
of millionaire accomplices.

26:13.729 --> 26:14.892
You mean suspects.

26:15.314 --> 26:17.722
Lieutenant Schilz was probably killed
by an accomplice.

26:17.816 --> 26:19.856
Or killed catching the thief in the act.

26:20.027 --> 26:22.732
Are you interested in clearing him
or catching the bad guys?

26:22.821 --> 26:24.316
Both. If we exonerate him,

26:24.406 --> 26:27.087
then his wife and daughter
will get the death benefits they deserve.

26:27.117 --> 26:28.518
Did you locate Petty Officer Toner?

26:28.577 --> 26:30.570
Traced her to West Chester,
PA, on my way now.

26:35.793 --> 26:37.417
The pilot and his RIO are dead.

26:37.503 --> 26:40.457
I don't even want to hear the word
"curse" out of your mouth, DiNozzo.

26:40.548 --> 26:42.457
- Would I say that, boss?
- You said it to me.

26:43.759 --> 26:45.004
You said it first.

26:45.886 --> 26:48.009
- Nice drive, Ben.
- Oh, yeah!

26:48.264 --> 26:49.592
For someone with your swing.

26:54.895 --> 26:56.306
Miss Toner?

26:58.107 --> 27:01.606
- The pro told me you were teeing off.
- I was trying to.

27:02.027 --> 27:03.190
Sorry.

27:03.279 --> 27:05.355
I've just drove in from D.C.
To speak with you.

27:05.447 --> 27:06.648
It'll only take a few minutes.

27:06.699 --> 27:09.534
Do you know anything
about golf etiquette, young woman?

27:09.743 --> 27:10.823
Not really.

27:10.911 --> 27:12.868
This is a private club.
How'd you get in here?

27:13.706 --> 27:15.164
I showed these at the gate.

27:17.585 --> 27:20.751
I'm sorry to hear that Mark's been dead
all these years.

27:21.130 --> 27:25.210
I always imagined him on some beach
in Mexico, sipping margaritas.

27:26.093 --> 27:27.801
You believe he stole the money.

27:27.886 --> 27:30.212
Well, he and Randy were the only ones
who had the combo

27:30.306 --> 27:32.215
and Randy was playing poker all night.

27:32.683 --> 27:34.225
Had to have been Mark.

27:35.894 --> 27:39.061
Well, if that's true, then his accomplice
got away with the money.

27:42.943 --> 27:45.565
Easy to see where you're going
with this, Agent Todd.

27:46.238 --> 27:48.776
You said you saw my house, nice.

27:49.325 --> 27:51.234
This country club, also nice.

27:51.327 --> 27:54.493
Both expensive. I didn't marry money.

27:56.915 --> 27:58.030
Yet.

27:58.125 --> 28:02.253
And with the losers in my family,
I sure as hell didn't inherit it.

28:02.921 --> 28:05.839
So you're wondering
if I was in on it with Mark.

28:06.759 --> 28:08.383
Killed him and took the money.

28:09.928 --> 28:12.170
Well, either that or you won the lottery.

28:14.308 --> 28:15.506
$2 million.

28:16.935 --> 28:18.264
I...

28:18.771 --> 28:20.348
I carry this for good luck.

28:23.442 --> 28:25.518
You can laminate a losing ticket.

28:29.198 --> 28:31.523
Oh, come on home with me, honey.

28:31.659 --> 28:34.410
I'll show you the write-up
from the Canton Gazette.

28:34.828 --> 28:38.244
It was too big to laminate, though.
I had to have it framed.

28:39.458 --> 28:40.738
Let's go.

28:42.127 --> 28:43.290
Fore!

28:45.214 --> 28:46.376
Never do that again.

28:46.465 --> 28:48.956
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were going to get all freaked out.

28:49.051 --> 28:52.336
Well, it's an automatic reflex
when one is a golfer, Abigail.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.137
Please don't call me Abigail.

28:54.223 --> 28:57.307
Then don't yell "fore"
when I have a niblick in my hand.

28:57.393 --> 28:59.385
A niblick? Sounds like a sex act.

28:59.478 --> 29:03.345
Yes, that's what I thought it was
the first time I heard the term.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.978
A niblick is what
a nine-iron used to be called

29:06.068 --> 29:09.686
when golf was the province
of Scottish nobles,

29:09.780 --> 29:13.778
not the democratic "lovely walk spoiled"
by the weekend duffer.

29:14.076 --> 29:17.908
So, what? You think he was killed
by a niblick to the kidney?

29:17.996 --> 29:19.325
No, no, no, no.

29:19.415 --> 29:22.949
The CAT scan revealed
a puncture wound to the chest cavity,

29:23.043 --> 29:25.415
caused by a thin, sharp object,

29:26.171 --> 29:30.169
that perforated the pericardial sack
and then penetrated the heart.

29:30.259 --> 29:32.132
- Ouch!
- Ouch, indeed.

29:32.219 --> 29:33.499
So what about your niblick?

29:33.595 --> 29:36.762
I was trying to see if this could have
caused these hair fractures

29:36.849 --> 29:38.473
to the pelvis and lumbar vertebrae.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.346
But it's too flexible
to cause uniform fracturing

29:41.437 --> 29:42.979
across both sides of the pelvis.

29:43.063 --> 29:46.266
No, it had to be
an object much more rigid.

29:46.859 --> 29:49.314
What about his abrupt stop
on an e-ticket ride?

29:49.403 --> 29:52.570
No, no, no, no. There are faint traces
of bleeding on the CAT scan.

29:52.656 --> 29:54.981
No, these fractures occurred

29:55.200 --> 29:57.952
before or immediately after he expired.

29:58.036 --> 29:59.412
Are you sure

29:59.913 --> 30:03.958
you didn't find anything here in this area
on his uniform?

30:04.710 --> 30:08.708
No, nothing that would cause these.
But I wasn't looking closely.

30:10.382 --> 30:12.256
Look closely, my dear.

30:12.718 --> 30:14.710
Of course, my darling.

30:17.139 --> 30:19.546
The robbery is a legend on this ship.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.935
Knowing Lieutenant Schilz
didn't get off with the cash

30:23.562 --> 30:25.768
is gonna start a treasure hunt.
Excuse me.

30:29.234 --> 30:32.354
- Bring back fond memories?
- Not so fond.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.855
The safe hadn't been jimmied.

30:36.033 --> 30:39.199
Ensign Wiles and Erin said
nothing was missing but the cash.

30:43.248 --> 30:44.577
Was something going on

30:44.666 --> 30:46.908
between you and Petty Officer Toner,
Agent Owens?

30:47.002 --> 30:48.282
- No.
- Called her a hottie.

30:48.378 --> 30:50.231
And you keep referring to her
by her first name.

30:50.255 --> 30:53.126
We're not allowed to fraternise
with enlisted females, you know that.

30:53.217 --> 30:56.420
You're not allowed to put
assumptions in reports either.

30:57.137 --> 30:59.426
You've made your point, Agent Gibbs.

30:59.932 --> 31:03.098
I blew that,
but I wasn't screwing around with Erin.

31:03.185 --> 31:06.388
She had something going on
with one of the airmen.

31:07.397 --> 31:10.897
- That wasn't in your report.
- It didn't seem pertinent.

31:11.902 --> 31:12.981
Name.

31:13.362 --> 31:17.110
Martinez. Martinez.
Petty Officer Ted Martinez.

31:17.574 --> 31:19.366
Hi. Excuse me.

31:22.412 --> 31:24.452
- You think he's involved?
- I don't know.

31:24.540 --> 31:28.158
But since it was his hottie working here,
you should have looked into him.

31:29.878 --> 31:30.957
You're right, sir.

31:31.463 --> 31:35.046
Do not "sir" me. I work for a living.

31:35.133 --> 31:38.419
- Gibbs.
- Erin Toner is living large.

31:38.512 --> 31:40.635
Nice house, country club membership.

31:40.722 --> 31:42.929
Do not tell me
that she has a rich husband.

31:43.016 --> 31:44.974
Hit the Ohio Lotto for $2 million.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.139
Did you check that out?

31:46.228 --> 31:48.470
Yeah, I saw the winning ticket
and newspaper clippings.

31:48.564 --> 31:50.355
State Lottery Board
is closed for the day.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.638
Call in the morning.

31:54.486 --> 31:56.278
Can you hear me now?

31:59.408 --> 32:01.151
Got him. "Ted Martinez.

32:01.243 --> 32:03.781
"Aviation Machinist's Mate,
Second Class.

32:03.871 --> 32:06.444
"Honourable discharge June 2, 1994."

32:06.540 --> 32:08.532
A lot of sailors left the Navy
in June of '94.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.452
Aviation Machinist's Mate.

32:10.544 --> 32:12.501
That means he was working
the flight deck.

32:12.588 --> 32:15.292
Petty Officer Second.
Probably a plane captain.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.213
What?

32:18.343 --> 32:21.593
Who would have had the ability
to stuff a body into a cargo pod?

32:22.472 --> 32:24.963
- Anyone on the hangar deck.
- Who's most likely?

32:25.225 --> 32:27.266
You're asking me to make
an assumption, Agent Gibbs.

32:27.311 --> 32:29.350
I'm not asking you to write it down.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.019
The pilot, the RIO, the plane captain.

32:34.026 --> 32:35.769
Don't strain your eyes, boss.

32:36.528 --> 32:39.280
- That's no coincidence.
- Don't tell me...

32:39.364 --> 32:43.611
Petty Officer Martinez
was the plane captain on the Tomcat

32:43.702 --> 32:47.320
that dropped the pod
that had Lieutenant Schilz's body in it.

32:57.733 --> 33:00.900
Whoa! I should've been
playing Beethoven.

33:01.529 --> 33:03.071
It's not Beethoven?

33:04.323 --> 33:06.114
It's the Newlydeads.

33:09.453 --> 33:12.074
- What's the orange stuff?
- I don't know yet.

33:12.248 --> 33:14.703
But it's only on this part
of the mummy's shirt.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.164
Same area
as Ducky's hairline fractures.

33:17.753 --> 33:20.078
You went to see Ducky
before you came to see me?

33:20.923 --> 33:23.248
Is there some kind of priority here
I don't know about?

33:23.342 --> 33:25.169
A girl likes to be thought of first.

33:28.556 --> 33:32.138
I don't know if it's synthetic or natural,
but it's definitely a fibre.

33:32.226 --> 33:33.934
What's orange in the Navy?

33:34.812 --> 33:35.926
Life jackets.

33:36.438 --> 33:39.060
Weren't the mummy's shoes found
in a hold with old life jackets?

33:39.149 --> 33:40.950
Never believed that
he was in there with them.

33:41.026 --> 33:44.276
- You might have to change your opinion.
- Did you match Petty Officer Martinez

33:44.363 --> 33:46.190
- to those partial prints on the pod?
- Yep.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.358
No big surprise,
he was the plane captain.

33:48.450 --> 33:51.286
- I was hoping they wouldn't match.
- One of them didn't.

33:52.955 --> 33:55.327
I scanned the ridges
and cleaned the garbage out.

33:55.416 --> 33:57.289
I got six Galton details.

33:57.376 --> 34:01.125
I like 10 to 12,
but six is enough if you get lucky.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.838
Doesn't look like we got lucky.

34:02.923 --> 34:06.458
Well, I limited it to naval personnel
that served between '90 and '94.

34:06.552 --> 34:10.502
- Still a lot of ridges and curves.
- I might be able to lower the threshold.

34:10.598 --> 34:11.629
How?

34:11.724 --> 34:13.632
I could give you a name
and a serial number.

34:13.726 --> 34:15.931
Oh, that might help.

34:17.353 --> 34:19.561
Whoa, we've got
nothing like this at Pearl.

34:19.898 --> 34:22.650
- This is where the big boys play.
- DiNozzo!

34:22.735 --> 34:24.976
Speaking of big boys. Yeah, boss?

34:27.697 --> 34:29.440
What are you doing here?

34:29.699 --> 34:32.571
Well, my flight's not till
9:00 in the morning.

34:32.953 --> 34:34.946
Since I'm here, I thought that

34:35.581 --> 34:36.826
maybe...

34:37.333 --> 34:39.159
You know how to do
a database search?

34:39.251 --> 34:40.496
Yeah, yeah, I do.

34:41.170 --> 34:42.996
Use that computer. Locate Martinez.

34:44.922 --> 34:48.208
- I'm looking for Martinez, boss.
- Yeah? I'm getting coffee.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.429
You got computers at Pearl?

34:53.891 --> 34:55.005
Yeah.

34:55.391 --> 34:57.930
But ours is on the beach
so we can surf on breaks.

34:59.563 --> 35:01.971
They surf on breaks.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.451
Didn't you have a flight to catch,
Agent Owens?

35:17.539 --> 35:18.654
Hey.

35:20.542 --> 35:23.709
You know, it's a little after 2:00
and my flight's not until...

35:24.922 --> 35:26.464
There'll be another flight.

35:28.884 --> 35:30.082
Coffee?

35:33.722 --> 35:35.964
All right, what do you got?

35:36.058 --> 35:38.727
We got Petty Officer Martinez
was a Mexican national,

35:38.811 --> 35:40.269
when he joined the Navy.

35:40.562 --> 35:44.430
He was discharged at Norfolk,
June 2, 1994

35:44.692 --> 35:47.977
where he had his mail
forwarded to the Plaza...

35:48.070 --> 35:50.109
The Plaza Hotel in New York,
where he was

35:50.197 --> 35:52.569
June 5 till the 22nd, when he flew...

35:52.658 --> 35:55.493
To Manzanillo, Mexico.
Registered at Las Brisas with a wife.

35:55.577 --> 35:57.535
No first name,
just Mr and Mrs Martinez.

35:57.621 --> 36:00.456
They stayed at Las Brisas
until the ninth of July,

36:00.541 --> 36:03.162
and after that they... He... I lost him.

36:03.252 --> 36:04.414
Yeah, and I found him.

36:04.503 --> 36:06.911
In Guadalajara
at the Presidente InterContinental.

36:07.005 --> 36:10.837
Stayed there for 10 days and then...
And then I lost him, too.

36:13.262 --> 36:16.713
Okay. Find out where he was born.
Check with the local police there.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.594
A guy usually goes home
when he's separated.

36:19.685 --> 36:21.345
- I'm going...
- For coffee?

36:21.437 --> 36:22.551
To the head.

36:30.612 --> 36:33.448
- Still no match?
- Nothing good enough to take to court.

36:33.532 --> 36:35.110
But if my life depended on it,

36:35.200 --> 36:38.320
I'd say it was her
right middle finger that made that.

36:38.412 --> 36:39.740
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.621
I spectroed the fibre.

36:41.707 --> 36:44.459
It's cotton canvas
dyed orange Number 7.

36:44.918 --> 36:46.792
But it's not from a life preserver.

36:47.129 --> 36:49.371
They're made out of
urethane-coated nylon.

36:53.719 --> 36:55.296
It's the mailbag, Abby.

36:57.055 --> 36:58.336
Orange mailbag.

36:58.807 --> 36:59.886
Cool.

36:59.975 --> 37:02.347
Right, I understand. Are you sure?

37:02.478 --> 37:03.592
Ohio lottery?

37:06.064 --> 37:07.475
Okay. Thank you.

37:09.276 --> 37:13.404
Erin Toner was telling the truth.
August 10, '94, she hit a pick six.

37:13.489 --> 37:16.858
Bought the ticket at a 7-Eleven
outside of Canton, Ohio.

37:17.659 --> 37:20.447
She hit for $37,000. She lied.

37:20.662 --> 37:23.118
She and Martinez stole that money,
not Lieutenant Schilz.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.495
Kate, incriminating her
doesn't exonerate Schilz.

37:25.584 --> 37:26.663
She could've played him.

37:26.752 --> 37:28.329
No. They forced him to open the safe,

37:28.420 --> 37:30.380
they murdered him
and they stuffed him in the pod.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.376
Unless Martinez or Toner admits Schilz
had nothing to do with the robbery,

37:33.467 --> 37:34.736
there's no way to exonerate him.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.337
I'll get them to confess.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.388
How are you gonna do that?

37:41.016 --> 37:42.558
I don't know yet.

37:43.393 --> 37:46.478
Martinez was murdered
in a Piedras Negras motel.

37:46.563 --> 37:48.686
My God. She's a black widow.

37:48.941 --> 37:50.850
I don't think she was ever married.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.946
We got her.

37:56.156 --> 38:00.699
Kate, go back to Pennsylvania
and bring Erin Toner in.

38:01.286 --> 38:02.994
How? I can't arrest her, can I?

38:03.080 --> 38:06.912
No, no. She has to come voluntarily.

38:09.336 --> 38:10.914
Why the hell would I do that?

38:11.004 --> 38:13.080
Latent prints off
Lieutenant Schilz's uniform

38:13.173 --> 38:15.047
match Petty Officer Martinez's.

38:15.133 --> 38:18.051
He was the plane captain
on the Tomcat that dropped the pod.

38:18.136 --> 38:20.259
You pulled prints 10 years later?

38:20.514 --> 38:22.388
The pod was hermetically sealed.

38:22.474 --> 38:26.424
We believe that Martinez forced
Lieutenant Schilz to open the safe

38:26.520 --> 38:29.011
murdered him,
and stuffed his body in a cargo pod.

38:31.024 --> 38:32.816
I think I knew Martinez.

38:32.901 --> 38:36.353
But I knew a lot of sailors on that cruise.

38:37.865 --> 38:39.656
Martinez is hiding in Mexico.

38:39.741 --> 38:43.360
We will find him, and when we do,
we want a solid case for extradition.

38:43.453 --> 38:45.446
Do I look like a Mexican judge?

38:46.582 --> 38:49.832
We'd like your help in doing
a virtual recreation

38:49.918 --> 38:51.543
of the theft for the hearing.

38:52.337 --> 38:54.911
- Why me?
- We can't locate Ensign Randy Wiles.

38:55.007 --> 38:57.213
You're the only one that worked
in disbursing back then.

38:57.301 --> 38:58.332
Honey,

38:59.303 --> 39:01.758
are you working something
you're not telling me?

39:03.849 --> 39:05.557
I wanna exonerate Lieutenant Schilz

39:05.642 --> 39:08.216
so that his wife and his daughter
can get the money due them.

39:10.063 --> 39:11.688
Tell them to play the lottery.

39:13.275 --> 39:15.896
I can call you back to the Navy,
Petty Officer Toner.

39:18.405 --> 39:19.685
The hell you can.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.653
These are orders

39:21.742 --> 39:24.114
recalling you to active duty
as a material witness

39:24.202 --> 39:25.401
in a capital offence.

39:25.495 --> 39:29.114
All I got to do is ink them, honey,
and your ass is back in the Navy.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.534
Or you can voluntarily help us.

39:36.298 --> 39:38.789
Lieutenant Schilz
finished a call to his wife

39:38.884 --> 39:41.553
and newborn daughter at 0545.

39:42.763 --> 39:45.254
I threw in that little heel click to show
he was really happy.

39:45.349 --> 39:46.891
Yeah, well, not for long.

39:46.975 --> 39:49.929
Petty Officer Martinez surprised him
with a knife,

39:50.020 --> 39:52.428
ransacked the safe and
forced Lieutenant Schilz

39:52.522 --> 39:56.816
to carry the money to a Tomcat,
where he murdered Lieutenant Schilz,

39:56.902 --> 39:59.607
stuffed him in a pod
and left with the money.

40:00.113 --> 40:01.311
So what do you think?

40:01.907 --> 40:03.946
I think you could use some help
from Disney.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.490
Hey, come on!
I wasn't finished with it yet.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.069
We wanted to make sure
we had the right scenario first.

40:09.331 --> 40:10.873
That one works for me.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.204
Not for me.

40:14.711 --> 40:15.790
No.

40:15.879 --> 40:19.462
Lieutenant Schilz would know
that Martinez was gonna kill him.

40:19.967 --> 40:21.924
He'd have resisted some place,

40:22.010 --> 40:24.299
especially in a passageway
full of sailors.

40:26.807 --> 40:29.724
Martinez had to kill him in disbursing.

40:30.185 --> 40:34.349
But, how did he move him to the pod
if he was dead?

40:35.649 --> 40:37.938
- He couldn't.
- But he could, my dear.

40:38.026 --> 40:40.149
You see, I found hairline fractures

40:40.237 --> 40:43.273
on Lieutenant Schilz's pelvis
and lumbar vertebrae,

40:43.365 --> 40:45.156
which Abby here matched to

40:45.242 --> 40:46.719
- orange canvas...
- Orange canvas fibres

40:46.743 --> 40:48.487
on Lieutenant Schilz's uniform.

40:48.996 --> 40:51.154
I saw an orange mailbag

40:51.248 --> 40:54.083
being dragged over knee-knockers
when I visited the ship.

41:00.549 --> 41:02.506
I'll get back to that in a minute.

41:03.218 --> 41:04.333
Where was I?

41:04.428 --> 41:06.586
Dragging orange mailbags
over knee-knockers, boss.

41:07.472 --> 41:09.381
Yeah. That bothered me.

41:09.933 --> 41:12.638
If Martinez did stuff
his body in a mail sack,

41:12.728 --> 41:14.601
and dragged it across the ship,

41:15.063 --> 41:19.524
how come
nobody noticed anything that was...

41:20.235 --> 41:21.266
Hinky?

41:21.361 --> 41:23.105
Yeah. Hinky.

41:23.739 --> 41:26.942
And that's when I remembered
how you used to turn heads

41:27.200 --> 41:28.659
when you walked by.

41:28.744 --> 41:30.024
I'm outta here.

41:30.370 --> 41:32.197
Not till the show's over.

41:36.334 --> 41:39.039
Now, who would've noticed a sailor

41:40.380 --> 41:42.788
dragging a mailbag over knee-knockers

41:43.717 --> 41:45.294
with you walking by?

41:49.306 --> 41:50.717
How's that animation?

41:52.517 --> 41:53.632
Much better.

41:54.603 --> 41:56.346
However, it's not evidence.

41:58.273 --> 42:01.309
You touch me again,
and I will have you arrested for assault.

42:02.736 --> 42:05.061
And the rest of you
for unlawful detainment.

42:05.530 --> 42:06.610
You're free to go.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.485
I said I'd get back to that fingerprint.

42:15.457 --> 42:16.572
It's yours.

42:17.209 --> 42:20.245
Oh, okay. It's mine.

42:21.004 --> 42:23.577
Where'd you find it? Mark's uniform?

42:24.257 --> 42:26.499
All that proves is that we got it on.

42:26.593 --> 42:29.677
Didn't find it on his uniform.
Got it from the Federales.

42:30.722 --> 42:34.091
Found it on the pistol
that killed Martinez in Piedras Negras.

42:35.685 --> 42:39.101
Two days before you hit the Lotto
for $37,000.

42:39.439 --> 42:43.271
We could extradite you,
but Mexican courts really don't like it

42:43.360 --> 42:45.234
when gringos kill one of their own.

42:45.654 --> 42:48.227
I don't know if it was you

42:49.324 --> 42:51.897
or Martinez that killed Lieutenant Schilz.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.527
You can tell it any way you want.

42:55.330 --> 42:56.528
We'll take it down.

43:00.168 --> 43:03.335
You know, in Hawaii, it takes forever
to get anything from the Federales.

43:03.421 --> 43:04.501
Same way here.

43:07.467 --> 43:10.468
No, no, no, no, guys don't tell me that...

43:11.638 --> 43:13.381
That fingerprint match was faked?

43:17.561 --> 43:20.016
Okay, you guys are crazy.

43:20.939 --> 43:22.314
- Yeah.
- Yep.
