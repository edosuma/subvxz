WEBVTT

00:00.302 --> 00:02.409
Pawnee is, as you all know,

00:02.502 --> 00:04.269
the fourth most obese city
in America.

00:04.304 --> 00:05.738
Soon to be number three.

00:05.772 --> 00:07.673
We're coming for you, San Antonio.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.341
No, we are not.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.076
We are slimming down...

00:11.111 --> 00:12.978
Starting right here at City Hall.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.113
I am implementing

00:14.147 --> 00:16.415
a government-wide health initiative.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.584
We could have
a City Hall dodgeball league.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.152
I have first pick, and my pick is Ron.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.187
Great idea. Keep 'em coming.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.722
Now, if anybody would like to join me,

00:23.757 --> 00:25.391
I will be running backwards
up the big hill

00:25.425 --> 00:26.425
behind the Wal-Mart.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.228
Don't freak out,

00:29.262 --> 00:32.430
but Joe from sewage just
unhooked your bra with his eyes.

00:32.465 --> 00:35.567
What? Oh, boy.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.536
Hi, Joe. What's up, Knope?

00:37.570 --> 00:39.038
Looking good these days.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.074
What do you say? Van's out back.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.375
Let's roll.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.010
- Where's this coming from?
- I don't know.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.545
You're putting out some vibe today.

00:46.579 --> 00:47.880
It's just driving me crazy.

00:47.914 --> 00:50.049
Listen, if you're looking
for a good time,

00:50.083 --> 00:53.385
why don't you come on down
to the toilet party?

00:53.420 --> 00:54.820
That's what we call
the sewage department.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.790
Great. Okay.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.158
Liking the view.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.628
- Still got it, Joe.
- No, you don't.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.918
Christopher, got a second?

01:25.952 --> 01:27.252
Oh, hey, Ron.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.288
Listen, I've eaten
a commissary hamburger

01:29.322 --> 01:31.090
for lunch every day for 12 years.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.624
I just wanted to make sure

01:32.659 --> 01:34.159
this pointless health crusade

01:34.194 --> 01:37.196
won't affect the only part
of my job that I like.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.831
Oh, no, those hamburgers are gone.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.332
Red meat can cause sluggishness,

01:40.366 --> 01:41.867
heart disease, even impotence.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.470
Has the opposite effect on me.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.105
You ever tried a turkey burger?

01:46.139 --> 01:49.041
Is that a fried turkey leg
inside a grilled hamburger?

01:49.075 --> 01:50.776
If so, yes. Delicious.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.745
A turkey burger--you take
lean ground turkey meat,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.814
and you make that into a
burger, instead of red meat.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.483
Why would anyone do that
to themselves?

01:57.517 --> 02:00.352
What if I told you that
I could make a turkey burger

02:00.386 --> 02:03.956
that tastes better than any
other burger you've ever had?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.458
Challenge accepted--

02:06.493 --> 02:08.894
Cook-off later today in the courtyard.

02:08.928 --> 02:11.964
If I win, hamburgers remain
in the commissary.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.799
What do I get if I win?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.367
The rarest jewel of all--

02:15.401 --> 02:18.003
Victory over me, Ron Swanson.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.539
I like that. We're on.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.141
You know, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

02:22.175 --> 02:25.144
but I actually checked out that,
uh--that snow globe museum

02:25.178 --> 02:27.579
that you recommended,
and it was pretty awesome,

02:27.614 --> 02:28.714
I have to say.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.315
I mean, I did get in trouble
for shaking one.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.151
Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.919
So I have some ideas
for the health initiative.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.655
Okay. How about I swing by later,

02:36.689 --> 02:38.690
and we'll just, you know,
maybe go over everything?

02:38.725 --> 02:41.260
Or we could go out after work--

02:41.294 --> 02:44.530
You know, go to JJ's
or something, grab a bite.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.765
Um, I-I don't think I can.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.267
But why don't we just talk
about it later

02:48.301 --> 02:51.503
in this building?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.038
Okay? All right.

02:53.072 --> 02:55.741
But, uh, you're great,
and you have great ideas,

02:55.775 --> 02:57.676
and...

02:57.710 --> 03:01.013
Um...

03:01.047 --> 03:02.214
Uh, bye.

03:03.783 --> 03:07.286
Bye, babe.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.421
Hey, I brought
this cholesterol-testing kit

03:09.455 --> 03:11.190
for the health thing.
Okay, let's do it.

03:11.224 --> 03:14.893
So I asked Ben out to dinner,
and he said no.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.196
What? He seemed really into you.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.530
What did he say exactly?

03:18.565 --> 03:20.933
He was like, "huh? What?
Huh? Oh. Bye."

03:20.967 --> 03:23.101
And then he walked into an
office that wasn't his.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.536
Oh. You know what?

03:24.571 --> 03:26.071
If he doesn't want to go out
with you, he's nuts.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.540
You're awesome, and there's a
million other guys out there.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.610
I have been having so much fun
just dating a bunch of people.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.745
I know. Who was that guy
you were talking to out there

03:33.780 --> 03:35.614
and then also kissing? I was--

03:35.648 --> 03:37.583
Crap on a crayfish.
That really stings.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.884
I haven't pricked you yet.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.552
Oh, sorry. I was just picturing it.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.654
You know what?
Maybe you need to cast a wider net.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.056
Have you thought
about Internet dating?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.457
Really? I don't think that's for me.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.559
Aah! You're a monster.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.328
Still haven't done it yet.
You know what?

03:49.362 --> 03:50.929
I'll help you set up a profile.
It'll be fun.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.764
All right, yeah, let's do it.
Okay, good.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.299
- I'm glad that's over.
- Oh, it's not.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.302
You, Ann!

03:58.705 --> 04:00.372
Who the hell is "Forp"?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.774
I don't know.
I couldn't really hear him.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.610
It sounded like his name was Forp.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.511
- You get his number?
- No.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.414
Good girl.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.916
Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.951
Hey, I'm just gonna pop over
to grain 'n simple

04:12.986 --> 04:15.020
to get the very best
ingredients for my burger.

04:15.054 --> 04:17.856
- Do you want to come?
- What is grain 'n simple?

04:17.890 --> 04:19.658
It's a health-food store.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.260
Pawnee doesn't have
a health-food store.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.962
No, but Snerling does, and
it's only a 40-minute drive.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.330
What are you doing, Andy?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.499
I'm getting healthier snacks
for the shoeshine stand.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.001
Chris is a food genius.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.702
Did you know that the food
you eat becomes energy?

04:30.737 --> 04:34.439
Yeah. Boom! That's spaghetti.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.308
Nachos.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.176
That's a cookie.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.379
That's my husband.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.648
- See you tomorrow?
- Okay.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.383
Is that a different guy from earlier?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.385
- What?
- Never mind.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.919
You ready to rock this profile?

04:47.954 --> 04:48.987
All right.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.689
Yellow-haired female

04:50.723 --> 04:53.959
likes waffles and news.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.861
Sexy, well-read blonde

04:55.895 --> 04:57.829
loves the sweeter things in life.

04:57.864 --> 04:58.964
Much better.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.266
- Hobbies?
- Organizing my agenda.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.534
Wait, that doesn't sound fun.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.337
Um, jamming on my planner.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.638
Favorite place?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.508
Upstairs there's this mural
of wildflowers,

05:09.542 --> 05:11.209
and I like to sit on a bench
in front of it.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.577
Really?

05:12.612 --> 05:13.945
It could be anywhere in the world--

05:13.980 --> 05:16.248
Paris, Hawaii,
the Grand Canyon.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.684
No, just the bench
in front of the mural.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.951
What about, like,
an actual meadow

05:19.986 --> 05:21.320
- where wildflowers are?
- Ew, Ann.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.422
I'm scared of bees. Mural.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.756
Okay, what do you think of dogs?

05:24.791 --> 05:25.824
Love.

05:25.858 --> 05:26.892
- Cats.
- Love.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.493
- Fish.
- Love.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.128
Turtles.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.964
No opinion.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.499
They're condescending.

05:34.534 --> 05:37.202
Describe your ideal man.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.238
He's dark and mysterious,

05:40.273 --> 05:43.108
and he can sing,
and he plays the organ.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.944
I think you just described
the Phantom of the Opera.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.879
Mm.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.550
Ah, Nirvana. Hey, guys.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.684
Hey, Chris.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.086
Amber, Annie, Bill, Johnny.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.390
No, I don't plan to buy anything here.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.460
I buy my burger ingredients
at food and stuff,

06:01.494 --> 06:03.962
a discount-food outlet
equidistant from my home

06:03.996 --> 06:05.297
and my work.

06:05.331 --> 06:09.134
I came here for the same
reason people go to the zoo.

06:10.636 --> 06:11.770
Shh.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.707
Look at that thing.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.543
Nature is amazing.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.879
Okay. Oh, my God.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.415
A 98% match.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.783
That's a soul-mate-level match.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.718
I've never seen anything
this high before.

06:27.753 --> 06:29.554
Awesome.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.623
Okay. I know what you're thinking.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.792
And you know what?
You have to forget about Ben.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.660
He had his chance, and he blew it.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.398
This computer could have found
the future Mr. Leslie Knope.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.666
Yeah. Okay...

06:41.701 --> 06:44.069
Entire universe of guys
I might date,

06:44.103 --> 06:46.304
let's see what you got.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.472
Ah!

06:50.339 --> 06:52.435
This is Craig at hoosiermate.com.
How can I help you?

06:52.445 --> 06:54.613
Craig, your service is crap.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.615
- Can you be more specific?
- Yes.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.083
Your soul-mate match
was totally wrong for me.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.851
I mean, I like him as a friend
and everything,

06:59.886 --> 07:00.986
but I'd never go out with him.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.454
He's like a little sister to me.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.822
We have a very sophisticated algorithm

07:03.856 --> 07:05.791
that's paired up thousands of couples.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.259
I actually met my wife on the site.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.593
Really? Well, that's not gonna last.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.761
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.797
Your marriage is a sham.
Good-bye, Craig.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.467
See you, sweetheart.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.868
Wow, he seems nice.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.870
Eh. He kind of lives in a barn.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.005
- What's up?
- What's wrong with me?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.707
Why do good guys hate me
and gross guys love me?

07:22.742 --> 07:23.942
Diagnose me.
You're a nurse.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.777
There's nothing wrong with you.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.780
You are an intelligent,
classy, attractive woman.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.216
But for whatever reason,
right now

07:31.250 --> 07:33.785
only douche-y guys are buying
what you're selling.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.689
So I should go and ask them
what they think I'm selling.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.192
A douche-vestigation.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.226
Nice.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.994
Hi, Joe.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.729
I know you're gonna take this
the wrong way,

07:44.764 --> 07:46.131
but can I talk to you
for a second?

07:46.165 --> 07:49.134
You can do anything to me
for any number of seconds.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.702
- Hmm.
- Would you like to talk outside

07:50.736 --> 07:52.804
- in my van?
- No. Here's fine.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.908
I was flattered
by what you said earlier.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.878
And I was just wondering, what
do you look for in a woman?

07:59.912 --> 08:02.914
She can't be in a wheelchair,

08:02.949 --> 08:04.683
no canes, no gray hair.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.017
So basically
you're just attracted to me

08:06.052 --> 08:07.319
because I'm not an elderly person.

08:07.353 --> 08:08.587
Yeah.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.822
And as I aforementioned,

08:10.857 --> 08:12.891
you have a killer dumpster.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.562
What does this do?

08:23.402 --> 08:25.937
Would you like to sample
our vegan bacon?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.439
100% meatless.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.474
Yes, please.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.614
Another, please.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.618
Sure.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.219
S-sir, is there a problem?

08:41.254 --> 08:44.422
I'm just making sure
no one ever has to eat this.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.725
I-I don't think
I can give you anymore.

08:46.759 --> 08:47.993
I want one.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.566
Yeah, I'm calling to lodge a complaint

08:54.600 --> 08:57.302
about the seaweed and almond
under-eye cream

08:57.336 --> 08:58.937
I purchased from you guys.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.206
Oh, my problem is it smells terrible.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.441
Yeah, I even mixed it
with another under-eye cream,

09:03.476 --> 09:06.044
and it still smelled,
so I ruined two eye creams.

09:06.078 --> 09:09.414
Yes, I will hold.

A kiwano or horned melon.

09:39.278 --> 09:40.612
Oh, I take skittles,

09:40.646 --> 09:43.281
and I put it between
two starbursts.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.483
- You know what I call it?
- Skittle sandwich.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.185
That's pretty good.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.121
No, I call it Andy's mouth surprise.

09:50.156 --> 09:54.326
It's nice because the flavor
of the starbursts

09:54.360 --> 09:55.427
really bring out

Do you want to go to lunch?

10:10.242 --> 10:12.477
Uh, no, I don't really feel
like going to JJ's.

We can go anywhere.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.180
Your choice. I'm buying.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.616
Can I get apps and 'serts?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.551
'Serts are what I call desserts.

Car.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.890
This'll be fun.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.059
Let's say you rub a bottle
and a genie comes out

11:01.093 --> 11:03.194
and gives you three wishes--
What would those wishes be?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.030
- Come on, Leslie.
- This'll be a fun game.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.164
Three wishes. Go.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.700
Okay, first wish,
I have a huge house

11:08.734 --> 11:10.068
with a ton of balconies.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.603
Yeah, okay.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.438
And I would just stand out
there observing my empire,

11:13.472 --> 11:15.073
like a drug dealer
in a Michael Bay movie.

11:15.107 --> 11:18.443
And I'll just spend my time
out there reading my iPad

11:18.477 --> 11:20.845
and drinking espressos
in a terrycloth robe.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.781
Wish number two.

11:22.815 --> 11:27.085
Okay, I'm the CEO
of the Spike TV Network.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.721
And my best friend / personal assistant

11:29.755 --> 11:32.090
is Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.826
And we create
a raunchy animated series

11:34.860 --> 11:39.097
based on our friendship called
<i>Tommy and the Foxx.</i>

11:39.131 --> 11:41.132
Okay, we don't have
to do this anymore.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.233
No, no, I'm into it now.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.435
Wish number three--

11:43.469 --> 11:45.003
They remake <i>Point Break.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:46.971
I play both roles--

11:47.006 --> 11:48.940
Keanu and Swayze.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.042
I think if you continue
cross-training the way you have,

11:51.077 --> 11:53.378
you're gonna--

11:53.412 --> 11:54.879
I don't see any ingredients.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.348
- Have you bought ingredients?
- Nope.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.818
- Do you need help shopping?
- No.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.252
Are you hurt?
Can you move?

12:01.287 --> 12:02.454
Never felt better.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.889
Chris!

12:04.924 --> 12:06.257
Can I get these?

12:06.292 --> 12:07.559
I said one thing.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.661
Eh. Honey?

12:09.695 --> 12:11.162
Pinwheel.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.766
Let's play a different game.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.568
I'm gonna say stuff about me,

12:16.602 --> 12:17.902
and you say,
on a scale from one to ten,

12:17.937 --> 12:19.671
how interested in
that thing you are.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.673
Ready? Okay.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.142
I love sunshine and fresh
air and early-morning walks.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.176
- One.
- I have read

12:25.211 --> 12:26.511
five biographies
of Eleanor Roosevelt.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.879
- One.
- I work

12:27.913 --> 12:29.247
- at the parks and recreation...
- One.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.615
- That's what you do.
- One.

12:30.649 --> 12:32.150
I once kissed
a girl in college...

12:32.184 --> 12:33.752
Eight.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.386
Where I graduated
Summa Cum Laude in history.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.588
One, zero, negative a billion.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.857
Don't talk about it
anymore, please.

12:41.626 --> 12:44.963
I love food and stuff.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.433
It's where I buy all of my food...

12:48.467 --> 12:51.603
And most of my stuff.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.171
Hey, can I get these?

12:53.205 --> 12:54.539
How much are they?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.474
Two bucks apiece.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.676
Good deal.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.478
Anything else?

13:00.513 --> 13:04.382
Nope. Just the crows and the beef.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.718
So the only thing that's
important to you is hotness?

13:06.752 --> 13:09.487
Wendy, Lucy. All you cared about
was the shape of their boobs?

13:09.522 --> 13:10.955
No. I really liked them,

13:10.990 --> 13:13.191
and they happened
to have nice breasts.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.392
You're acting really weird.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.794
W-what'd you even
buy me lunch for--

13:15.828 --> 13:17.896
Just so you could yell at me
for what I like about women?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.798
Okay.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.132
Promise not to tell anyone?

13:21.167 --> 13:23.001
- Sure.
- This is insane.

13:23.035 --> 13:26.604
But you and I got matched up
on hoosiermate.com.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.674
98% match.

13:29.708 --> 13:34.145
Soul-mate-level match.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.214
You want to date me.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.348
This is a date.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.983
This is not a date, okay?

13:39.018 --> 13:40.985
Uh, you took me to a
fancy restaurant.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.587
You paid for my meal.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.189
And you're trying to get
to know me better.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.590
I was just trying to figure out

13:45.624 --> 13:47.926
why only sleazy guys
are into me right now.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.228

Ben, if it's okay with you,

14:46.151 --> 14:48.286
Leslie and I are gonna lead
the meeting today

14:48.320 --> 14:50.622
because of our deep
spiritual connection.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.690
Oka-- All right.

Les and I just had
something magical happen today

15:00.132 --> 15:01.599
at lunch.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.168
There is some weird juju
in this room right now.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.604
Office yoga.
We do stretches at our desk

15:06.639 --> 15:08.273
or next to our desk
or in a chair--

15:08.307 --> 15:09.841
always good for you.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.242
Um...

15:11.277 --> 15:13.778
We give everyone pedometers,

15:13.812 --> 15:15.013
and we have a contest--

15:15.047 --> 15:17.982
Whoever takes the most steps
wins a prize.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.184
You know, anything to get
their heart rate up.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.787
You know what else
gets people's heart rate up?

15:22.821 --> 15:24.689
Doing it.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.659
Talking about sex with my boss.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.828
Can you excuse us for a second?

15:30.863 --> 15:31.863
Yeah.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.231
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

15:33.265 --> 15:34.666
Ow! Let me get out of the chair!

15:34.700 --> 15:36.601
Hey! What is wrong with you?

15:36.635 --> 15:38.303
Leslie, it's the workplace.

15:38.337 --> 15:39.804
You're being a little bit
too feisty right now.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.006
You are being a little bit
too much of an ass right now.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.474
Okay? Knock it off.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.877
I can't fight this feeling anymore.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.478
You and I--

15:47.513 --> 15:50.648
We're dating.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.053
You should be so lucky.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.187
- Leslie.
- Huh?

15:56.221 --> 15:59.424
Tom.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.495
They should fix that.

16:05.128 --> 16:07.495
It was all-- just a joke.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.334
I can assure you, there's
nothing romantic going on

16:09.368 --> 16:11.102
- between me and Tom.
- I have a very strict policy--

16:11.136 --> 16:12.570
No office relationships,

16:12.604 --> 16:15.273
particularly between
a supervisor and an employee.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.641
The taxpayers pay us,

16:16.675 --> 16:18.209
so we can't have anything

16:18.243 --> 16:19.777
appearing even
remotely scandalous.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.579
I'm just saying, if you can't
keep your mouth to yourself,

16:21.613 --> 16:24.682
- I'm gonna have to suspend you.
- I understand.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.352
Look. Cucumber flower.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.520
Wow. That's so cute.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.589
Wait, that's a garnish.
You're not supposed to eat that.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.991
What?

16:33.025 --> 16:34.659
So just type up
those ones we talked about,

16:34.693 --> 16:36.260
and we'll get it
finalized tomorrow.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.062
Yep.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.397
- Hey, Tom.
- Yep.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.499
Um...

16:41.533 --> 16:44.402
What was all that stuff
with you and Leslie?

16:44.436 --> 16:47.005
Girl likes Indian food.
What can I say?

16:47.039 --> 16:48.406
Fine.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.708
We got matched up
on an online dating site.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.044
And I was messing with her.
She got pissed.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.380
So she took me out
in the hallway and kissed me

16:55.414 --> 16:57.415
- out of revenge.
- Really?

16:57.449 --> 16:59.584
And as much as it pains me
to admit this,

16:59.618 --> 17:01.019
it was not disgusting.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.287
Okay, well,
I don't need the details.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.223
I'm just saying,
she knows what to do.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.858
- All right.
- Like, I was impressed.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.926
- Yeah.
- It was stirring.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.429
- Good-bye.
- It felt like--

17:11.463 --> 17:12.864
- Can-- Yep.
- All right.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.566
- Just-- All right.
- Anyway, like I was saying...

17:15.601 --> 17:17.635
I humbly place before you

17:17.669 --> 17:20.438
my east meets west patented
Traeger turkey burger--

17:20.472 --> 17:21.939
An Asian fusion burger

17:21.973 --> 17:24.342
made with Willow Farms
organic turkey,

17:24.376 --> 17:26.044
a toasted tallegio-cheese crisp,

17:26.078 --> 17:28.946
papaya chutney,
black truffle aioli,

17:28.981 --> 17:31.382
and micro-greens
on a gluten-free brioche bun.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.418
- Enjoy.
- Mmm.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.853
This tastes as delicious
as Beyonce smells...

17:35.888 --> 17:37.121
I'm guessing.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.323
What is this in here-- Saffron?

17:39.358 --> 17:41.492
Wow, somebody's got a sharp palate.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.594
I love the umami flavor.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.663
Stop being so pretentious, Kyle.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.565
- Sorry.
- Here's mine.

17:47.599 --> 17:51.469
It's a hamburger
made out of meat on a bun

17:51.503 --> 17:53.004
with nothing.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.806
Add ketchup if you want.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.575
I couldn't care less.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.011
Ron, I'm so disappointed.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.280
I thought that you and I were
gonna have a real challenge.

18:02.314 --> 18:03.948
Never mind. This is better.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.850
- Way better.
- Mmm. Yep.

18:05.884 --> 18:06.851
Mm-hmm.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.152
Kyle?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.987
Sorry, Andy. Ron's is better.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.590
Damn it, Kyle.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.959
Oh, my God, it's so much
better, it's crazy.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.662
Turkey can never beat cow, Chris.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.163
Sorry.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.998
I don't understand.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.501
I-I-I've tinkered
with this recipe for years.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.237
Granted, it's been a long time
since I've had hamburger.

18:33.545 --> 18:34.779
This is better.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.280
The commissary will
continue to serve

18:36.315 --> 18:38.816
horrifying,
artery-clogging hamburgers.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.224
Man, we spent, like, 50 hours
working on those burgers.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.493
I know. Hard work never pays off.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.962
Cooking is dumb.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.364
I swear on this dead crow

18:53.398 --> 18:55.700
that I will never cook for you.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.470
I love you.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.439
I just wanted to make sure that
there were no hard feelings

19:01.473 --> 19:02.807
after I forced you
to break up with Tom.

19:02.841 --> 19:05.676
Oh, we weren't-- No.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.011
No hard feelings.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.613
'Cause it's just
a real bugaboo of mine.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.081
And it applies to everyone.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.949
Just the other day, Ben told me

19:11.984 --> 19:13.518
that he might want to
socialize with somebody

19:13.552 --> 19:15.119
from the government,
and I said, "I'm sorry"...

19:15.154 --> 19:17.155
- "Not possible."
- Really?

19:17.189 --> 19:18.723
Did he say who?

19:18.757 --> 19:21.159
No, and I didn't ask,
'cause it's irrelevant.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.693
He oversees every department.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.228
It simply can't happen.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.564
This is literally the best
thing I've ever eaten.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.866
Mmm. And it's so bad for me.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.434
I'm gonna have to jog
while I digest this.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.671
Excuse me.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.039
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.242
Well, uh, I think
I'm allergic to chutney.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.077
Also, what's chutney?

19:40.112 --> 19:41.779
- No clue.
- Yeah.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.281
Hey, I never got to tell you
the rest of my ideas.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.416
You want to go somewhere
and talk about 'em?

19:45.450 --> 19:46.951
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd love to.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.920
Um, let me get some actual food

19:48.954 --> 19:51.122
and then-- do you know

19:51.156 --> 19:53.925
that wildflower mural
up on the second floor?

19:53.959 --> 19:56.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

19:56.428 --> 19:57.461
You want to meet there?

19:57.496 --> 19:59.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.798
Sounds good.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.900
I don't know
if the online thing is for me.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.970
I prefer to meet people in person.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.939
It's like door number two

20:07.973 --> 20:10.741
on <i>Let's Make a Deal.</i>

20:10.776 --> 20:12.310
Do you want the thing that you have,

20:12.344 --> 20:13.744
that you know you like

20:13.779 --> 20:16.380
but isn't perfect,

20:16.415 --> 20:21.252
or do you give it up for
what's behind door number two?

20:21.286 --> 20:24.655
I think I like what I have.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.325
I'm gonna try to make it work
with Tom.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.926
I'm kidding.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.564
How did you and I get matched up?

20:33.599 --> 20:35.032
I made 26 profiles,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.201
each designed to attract
a different type of girl.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.137
Tom A. Haverford,
sporty and sexy.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.640
Tom B. Haverford,
smooth and soulful.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.275
Which letter did you get?

20:44.309 --> 20:46.210
"N." Tom N. Haverford.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.080
The "N" stands for "Nerd."

20:49.114 --> 20:50.181
I never even check that one,

20:50.215 --> 20:51.382
'cause no one ever responds to it.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.617
Okay, well, whatever.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.885
Tom N. Haverford collects globes.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.120
Great. That's enough.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.055
His favorite movie is books.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.123
Donna.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.998
Every time I want you
to shut up from now on.
