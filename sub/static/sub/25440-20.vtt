Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Lost and Found"</font>

00:45.523 --> 00:46.787
Just another day's travel

00:46.875 --> 00:49.893
and we are at
the Dark Kingdom!

00:50.003 --> 00:52.112
Hope we packed
our torches!

00:55.493 --> 01:00.168
Because the Kingdom is dark...
is where I was going with that.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.671
Are you okay, Eugene?
You seem distracted.

01:02.836 --> 01:04.430
Huh? Oh.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.841
Uh... I didn't want
to make...

01:06.928 --> 01:08.336
light of it?

01:09.149 --> 01:10.397
Look, it's just...

01:10.485 --> 01:12.420
now that we're so close
to the Dark Kingdom,

01:12.508 --> 01:15.116
it all feels more real,
ya know? Ha, hah.

01:15.204 --> 01:18.084
I mean, crazy rhino-man said if
we went there, we were doomed.

01:18.172 --> 01:19.788
And we have no idea
what we're in for!

01:19.875 --> 01:21.756
And our only clue as to
what's waiting for us

01:21.844 --> 01:24.325
is on three stupid pieces
of a torn scroll.

01:24.555 --> 01:26.361
That we can't even read!

01:26.665 --> 01:28.977
I know it's scary,
Eugene,

01:29.094 --> 01:31.166
but we cannot turn
back now.

01:31.344 --> 01:34.883
Besides, you and
I have other plans.

01:34.971 --> 01:38.828
Or at least we should
have other plans.

01:39.289 --> 01:40.912
Birthday plans?

01:41.062 --> 01:43.032
Oh my gosh,
I forgot your birthday!

01:43.141 --> 01:45.045
How could you
forget, Eugene?!

01:45.133 --> 01:46.311
I'm so sorry!

01:46.399 --> 01:48.183
You know what, I'm pretty
sure that giant firefly

01:48.270 --> 01:50.407
scorched my date book
and...

01:51.016 --> 01:52.987
Wait a minute,
it's not your birthday!

01:53.074 --> 01:54.889
Ha-ha, got you!

01:54.976 --> 01:56.820
Oh, you should
have seen your face!

01:56.908 --> 01:58.900
Pascal, Pascal, do his face.

02:03.518 --> 02:05.084
Well, then whose
birthday is it?

02:05.987 --> 02:07.420
Happy birthday!

02:08.880 --> 02:11.373
You know I don't
have a birthday right?

02:11.537 --> 02:13.842
I know we don't know
when you were born,

02:13.929 --> 02:16.678
but everybody has
a birthday.

02:16.765 --> 02:18.446
So I figured,
why not today?

02:18.533 --> 02:20.115
Oh! Make a wish!

02:20.202 --> 02:23.084
Uh, just don't eat
the cupcake.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.588
Eh, I don't really believe in
the whole wish-making thing,

02:26.675 --> 02:28.378
or really anything...

02:28.543 --> 02:30.525
that I can't see
with my own eyes.

02:30.612 --> 02:31.920
That I see, frog.

02:35.817 --> 02:38.566
Okay, okay, fine, you
don't need to make a wish.

02:38.653 --> 02:40.068
It is your day.

02:40.155 --> 02:42.871
You do what you want.

02:43.334 --> 02:44.615
Let's just make it
our day.

02:44.703 --> 02:45.740
And, you know what?

02:45.828 --> 02:48.363
I'm not gonna worry about
tomorrow, or the Dark Kingdom.

02:48.451 --> 02:50.498
I'm just gonna live
in the moment.

02:50.641 --> 02:51.922
And nothing...

02:52.365 --> 02:55.048
and I mean nothing
can ruin this moment.

03:00.242 --> 03:03.625
Smooch on your
own time, canoodlers!

03:03.764 --> 03:05.560
Oh, come on!

03:05.647 --> 03:06.690
Canardist and Vigor?!

03:06.778 --> 03:08.484
Are they following us?
They gotta be following us.

03:08.596 --> 03:12.667
- I have half a mind to...
- I'm sure they're not following us.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.006
We have been following you.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.671
Nehh...

03:16.758 --> 03:20.397
Vigor wants to give you
an important fortune.

03:20.506 --> 03:24.039
He seems to have grown
attached to you.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.561
There is no
accounting for taste.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.951
Well, I like him, too.

03:30.046 --> 03:31.829
That curse of
deadly misfortune?

03:31.925 --> 03:32.929
Pfft!

03:33.017 --> 03:34.977
Water under the bridge.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.055
Don't touch his banana.

03:37.665 --> 03:39.360
Oh-ho-ho,
lemme guess.

03:39.447 --> 03:40.720
The price of this...

03:40.853 --> 03:43.164
"important fortune..."

03:43.251 --> 03:44.915
is five silver pieces.

03:45.003 --> 03:48.009
The prediction is free,
of course.

03:48.173 --> 03:50.138
Now, quiet down

03:50.225 --> 03:55.673
and let Vigor summon
the spirits from beyond.

03:55.774 --> 03:58.368
Ugh, banana peels
everywhere.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.610
Yawn...

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.386 --> 04:19.968
Heavier yawn.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.890
Vigor!

04:25.060 --> 04:26.407
Ah!

04:29.548 --> 04:31.985
The things you keep
under your turban!

04:32.073 --> 04:34.415
Wonders never cease.

04:34.769 --> 04:36.610
"For you, the path awaits,

04:36.781 --> 04:39.396
"where the final
quarter lies,

04:39.484 --> 04:42.423
after many dire straits."

04:42.571 --> 04:44.328
"Final quarter?"

04:44.547 --> 04:47.564
He's gotta be talking about
the fourth piece of the scroll!

04:47.704 --> 04:50.231
That's
what you got from that?

04:50.318 --> 04:51.833
I got absolute
gibberish.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.642
If he meant the fourth
piece of the scroll,

04:53.730 --> 04:56.319
why not just say "fourth
piece of the scroll"?!

04:56.407 --> 04:58.188
That would
throw off the rhyme!

04:58.295 --> 05:00.774
Eugene, we need
the fourth piece

05:00.862 --> 05:02.532
to make sense
of the others.

05:02.832 --> 05:04.513
And besides,
doesn't this sound

05:04.866 --> 05:07.181
like it's gonna be
a birthday to remember?

05:07.268 --> 05:10.094
Fine. Where is
this path deal?

05:10.199 --> 05:12.883
Vigor will guide you...

05:14.095 --> 05:17.293
for five silver pieces.

05:21.239 --> 05:23.231
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:23.318 --> 05:25.135
It's my birthday, remember?!

05:25.223 --> 05:26.291
Vigor! Wait up!

05:28.311 --> 05:30.270
What did you find?

05:31.465 --> 05:34.876
"The Path of Demanitus."

05:35.184 --> 05:38.079
Demanitus was that
engineer-inventor guy

05:38.166 --> 05:40.762
who built the thing that
stopped the blizzard in Corona.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.207
Whoa, hello.

05:47.950 --> 05:49.575
Vigor?

05:49.925 --> 05:51.172
Monkey?

05:51.645 --> 05:53.543
Want a banana?

05:53.903 --> 05:55.036
Vigor?

05:58.486 --> 06:01.135
It's a-a-a...

06:01.222 --> 06:03.223
A-maze-ing!

06:03.331 --> 06:04.450
This is great!

06:04.538 --> 06:07.387
I've always wanted to
go through a giant maze.

06:07.629 --> 06:09.409
I'm happy for you,
I am.

06:09.497 --> 06:10.840
But look at that!

06:10.928 --> 06:12.715
It woulda been nice
if Demanitus left us,

06:12.803 --> 06:14.284
I don't know, a map
or something.

06:14.477 --> 06:17.137
You require no map...

06:25.465 --> 06:27.012
For I...

06:28.207 --> 06:31.270
am Lord Demanitus!

06:44.466 --> 06:46.403
Yeah. Nice try, Canardist!

06:46.491 --> 06:47.786
He's not Demanitus!

06:47.874 --> 06:50.028
 That guy lived
a thousand years ago!

06:51.569 --> 06:53.473
Oh, that's rich!

06:53.561 --> 06:55.076
Yeah...

06:55.164 --> 06:56.882
Well, no strings...

06:57.374 --> 07:00.516
Although, you certainly smell
like a 1000-year-old monkey!

07:00.604 --> 07:02.653
Okay, what's the
trick here, huh?

07:02.748 --> 07:03.934
Come on, costume?

07:04.022 --> 07:06.371
Very convincing...
lifelike costume?

07:06.502 --> 07:08.402
This is no subterfuge,
I assure you.

07:09.147 --> 07:10.981
I am Lord Demanitus,

07:11.578 --> 07:13.394
protector of ancient Corona,

07:13.482 --> 07:15.697
devotee of science
and invention,

07:15.785 --> 07:18.463
who has emerged
from this monkey

07:18.551 --> 07:19.911
in your time of need.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.137
Banana!

07:26.363 --> 07:28.292
Mm... mmm...

07:28.522 --> 07:30.070
What is going on here?

07:31.458 --> 07:33.840
Listen, and listen well...

07:34.018 --> 07:35.575
Millennia ago,

07:35.663 --> 07:38.121
<i>a mysterious event
in the heavens</i>

07:38.253 --> 07:40.582
<i>divided an
ancient power...</i>

07:40.879 --> 07:42.260
<i>in two.</i>

07:42.348 --> 07:45.754
<i>The Sun-Drop and MoonStone
fell to the Earth!</i>

07:45.995 --> 07:48.440
<i>Three of my pupils and
I researched the legend</i>

07:48.528 --> 07:50.661
<i>of the Sun-Drop
and MoonStone...</i>

07:50.749 --> 07:53.887
<i>two elements that
longed to re-unite.</i>

07:54.590 --> 07:57.051
<i>We searched, but, alas,
could not find them.</i>

07:57.139 --> 08:00.340
<i>Unfortunately, we were not
the only ones looking.</i>

08:02.983 --> 08:05.064
<i>My pupils betrayed me,</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:08.102
<i>and summoned my old
nemesis, Zhan Tiri!</i>

08:08.190 --> 08:09.996
<i>A warlock from
another realm,</i>

08:10.084 --> 08:12.177
<i>bent on destruction.</i>

08:16.692 --> 08:20.317
<i>It took all of my powers to
banish the evil from our world.</i>

08:22.770 --> 08:24.416
<i>I knew the research
I had written</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:27.129
<i>about the Sun-Drop
and MoonStone was valuable.</i>

08:27.217 --> 08:28.431
<i>Dangerous...</i>

08:28.519 --> 08:30.629
<i>in evil hands.</i>

08:31.912 --> 08:34.693
<i>So I tore the scroll,
and hid the pieces!</i>

08:34.898 --> 08:38.558
I placed the final piece
within the maze...

08:38.647 --> 08:41.965
which I created to
keep away the unworthy.

08:42.053 --> 08:45.286
Oh! You have a little something
right there, I think it's banana.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.990
Hm...

08:47.798 --> 08:49.739
And you're a monkey
because...?

08:50.318 --> 08:52.903
I could not let
Zhan Tiri find me!

08:53.068 --> 08:56.543
Using my scientific acumen
coupled with an ancient spell,

08:56.631 --> 08:58.512
I was able to create
a hiding place,

08:58.644 --> 09:00.840
a living, simian creature,

09:00.928 --> 09:04.002
inside of which I would
lay dormant until such time

09:04.090 --> 09:05.918
as I could emerge,
again.

09:06.033 --> 09:07.832
Ironclad logic.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.965
Why didn't you
come out before?

09:10.053 --> 09:11.068
I'm no sorcerer,

09:11.156 --> 09:12.904
but from
what I understand of the spell,

09:12.992 --> 09:15.185
it would allow me to
emerge from this form

09:15.273 --> 09:16.426
but once...

09:16.514 --> 09:18.429
and only for
a few short hours.

09:18.578 --> 09:22.629
After which, my spirit shall
retreat into this monkey...

09:22.724 --> 09:24.762
forever.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.746
Wow, if this guy
really is Demanitus,

09:35.838 --> 09:37.239
this is a huge honor!

09:37.327 --> 09:39.840
If this guy
is Demanitus.

09:39.928 --> 09:42.532
How do we know he isn't another
one of Zhan Tiri's cronies?

09:42.620 --> 09:43.928
I hear you, I hear you.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.782
Cautious optimism.
Emphasis on the caution.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.265
Dead end!

09:51.368 --> 09:53.106
This is so much fun!

09:53.234 --> 09:54.248
Okay, okay, okay.

09:54.336 --> 09:56.785
So, that was a...
A right turn...

10:00.455 --> 10:02.303
Not encouraging.

10:03.309 --> 10:06.450
"A room with no way in,
and no way out,

10:06.663 --> 10:09.364
see it in the rain,
but never in a drought."

10:09.452 --> 10:10.866
It's a riddle!

10:10.954 --> 10:13.301
I. Love. Riddles.

10:13.465 --> 10:15.323
Okay, no one
tell me the answers.

10:15.411 --> 10:17.226
- I got this.
- Seriously? Riddles?

10:17.313 --> 10:19.128
What the heck are riddles
gonna do for us here?!

10:19.215 --> 10:22.531
Riddles shall help you
get through this maze.

10:22.770 --> 10:25.367
And also... faith.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.153
Cut it out.

10:28.241 --> 10:30.023
Sorry... habit.

10:30.159 --> 10:31.614
Ahh...

10:32.012 --> 10:35.028
You must not believe
in only what you see.

10:35.116 --> 10:36.898
All right, look.

10:36.986 --> 10:39.702
When you grow up like I
did, you learn real quick:

10:39.790 --> 10:41.905
the difference between
believing only what you see

10:42.068 --> 10:44.051
and "having faith things
will work out"

10:44.139 --> 10:46.321
could be the difference
between eating a hot meal

10:46.409 --> 10:47.824
or having your last.

10:47.912 --> 10:50.127
I don't want your
flea-scratching stick!

10:50.621 --> 10:52.465
Gimme the
stick, gimme the stick!

11:02.424 --> 11:05.074
- Oh, for the love of...!
- Ivory spiders!

11:05.161 --> 11:07.793
They're venomous! 
Do not let them bite you!

11:13.269 --> 11:15.184
C'mon, Demanitus,
tell us the answer!

11:15.271 --> 11:16.452
I don't remember!

11:16.539 --> 11:18.442
I built this 1,000 years ago,
what do you expect?!

11:18.530 --> 11:20.221
Oh, I don't know, I expected
you to maybe remember

11:20.309 --> 11:22.424
how to get out of your own
spider death trap!

11:28.484 --> 11:30.132
Wait, I got it!

11:30.219 --> 11:31.600
"A room with
no way in..."

11:31.687 --> 11:32.734
a mushroom!

11:32.821 --> 11:34.203
Ah-ha!

11:35.162 --> 11:36.376
Oh, oh, oh,
oh, there's one!

11:50.530 --> 11:52.130
I told you faith
would get us through!

11:52.218 --> 11:54.169
What did that
have to do with faith!

12:06.313 --> 12:09.050
"If thou wish to skirt
a deadly stress,

12:09.138 --> 12:12.588
donate a coin,
and earn safe egress..."

12:12.826 --> 12:13.794
Hm...

12:18.170 --> 12:22.466
Oh, um... think
I misplaced my wallet.

12:22.695 --> 12:25.506
Of course, the
monkey has no money.

12:25.594 --> 12:27.084
Oh, it's okay.

12:27.172 --> 12:28.812
I'll spot you.

12:31.926 --> 12:34.908
- We're waiting.
- Ugh.

12:35.373 --> 12:38.013
Oh, come on,
this is my last coin!

12:38.137 --> 12:40.185
Think of it as
a birthday wish.

12:40.273 --> 12:42.920
I'm sorry, Blondie,
it's just not my style.

12:43.008 --> 12:44.113
- I know, I know,

12:44.201 --> 12:46.935
you think I'm being cynical.
- Mm-hmm...

12:47.649 --> 12:50.029
Okay, fine,
I'll put the coin in.

12:53.435 --> 12:56.803
I already paid that stupid
monkey five coins.

13:06.882 --> 13:10.117
"Remove a
piece, and I increase...

13:10.480 --> 13:12.550
No, wait...!

13:41.283 --> 13:43.302
The fourth piece
of the scroll!

13:43.390 --> 13:45.004
We did it!

13:48.048 --> 13:49.424
We'd better hurry.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.107
"Before thou claim thy glory,

13:54.195 --> 13:57.612
"have faith the crystal bridge
shall lead to thy quarry.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.451
"Use the key to unlock,

13:59.539 --> 14:02.122
after thy faithful walk."

14:02.210 --> 14:03.654
It's really not
your best work.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.865
Yes, yes, but look...

14:06.065 --> 14:07.946
A mon-key!

14:08.120 --> 14:10.035
No, denied.

14:10.145 --> 14:11.275
Here.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.231
Why did you
just do that?!

14:15.319 --> 14:17.083
You were
supposed to catch it!

14:17.171 --> 14:18.503
I wasn't ready!
You gotta warn me!

14:18.591 --> 14:21.246
I said, "here"!

14:21.334 --> 14:25.020
- That is not...
- Eugene... you can pick the lock.

14:25.884 --> 14:27.325
Fine. Rapunzel...

14:27.413 --> 14:28.637
bobby pin me.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.129
"Mon-key..."

14:37.635 --> 14:39.401
Acid, really?

14:42.013 --> 14:44.662
"Faith."
Right, right.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.460
Faith...

14:58.868 --> 15:00.450
Eugene! Run!

15:11.289 --> 15:12.989
Pull me up, pull me up!

15:23.515 --> 15:24.596
Okay...

15:24.683 --> 15:25.848
what can we learn
from this?

15:25.936 --> 15:27.044
How about...

15:27.132 --> 15:28.874
crystal makes for
a terrible bridge.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.943
- How's that?
- Eugene! Look.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.156
Maybe there really is something
to this faith business after...

15:52.610 --> 15:54.493
Good gravy, what is that?!

15:58.061 --> 15:59.665
- What did you do?!
- What?

15:59.752 --> 16:01.103
The coin!

16:01.866 --> 16:04.038
You were supposed to
put it in the fountain!

16:04.186 --> 16:06.558
Okay, so who cares if
I didn't put the coin in?

16:06.646 --> 16:08.110
What's the big deal?

16:09.499 --> 16:10.976
That is the big deal.

16:23.609 --> 16:26.058
- Faith is great, now turn it off!
- I can't!

16:26.145 --> 16:29.436
I didn't construct it
with vulnerabilities!

16:29.524 --> 16:32.039
I thought people would be
smart enough to put a coin in!

16:38.057 --> 16:40.639
Ooh! Ooh,
I'm not smart?!

16:40.726 --> 16:42.407
Well who builds a giant
whatever-that-is,

16:42.494 --> 16:44.054
and doesn't throw in
an off switch, huh?

16:44.142 --> 16:46.378
Huh?! That is
not smart!

16:51.568 --> 16:53.216
Eugene, next time, dodge

16:53.304 --> 16:54.822
and then make your point.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.569
We all make mistakes,
but perhaps...

17:10.656 --> 17:13.038
I can atone
for my errors.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.246
In there!

17:47.646 --> 17:49.794
Phew... ah!

17:51.750 --> 17:53.133
Oo-oo!

17:53.261 --> 17:55.649
I'm running out
of time, listen...

17:55.891 --> 17:59.024
one must unite the
Sun-Drop and MoonStone

17:59.164 --> 18:00.719
to summon
the ultimate power.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.165
Fourth piece of
the scroll contains

18:03.253 --> 18:05.611
the instructions
to wield that power.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.141
Wield the power?

18:07.229 --> 18:09.311
In the right hands,
it can be used for good.

18:09.399 --> 18:11.147
In the wrong hands,
it could be

18:11.235 --> 18:12.965
inconceivably deadly.

18:13.052 --> 18:14.703
Now you know why
I tested your faith...

18:14.791 --> 18:18.408
..to ensure the purest of hearts
controls the power!

18:18.580 --> 18:20.611
Then what if we just leave
the MoonStone alone, right?

18:20.699 --> 18:24.027
If the Sun-Drop does not
join with the MoonStone,

18:24.163 --> 18:29.261
the black rocks will reawaken,
and seek you out forever.

18:29.550 --> 18:32.754
It'll destroy everything
in your path!

18:33.359 --> 18:36.050
Oh, yes,
let's not do that.

18:37.192 --> 18:38.323
I have a question...

18:38.411 --> 18:40.941
how do we get out of this
miserable doom labyrinth?!

18:44.565 --> 18:46.780
The moon cannot be seen
without the sun's light.

18:46.868 --> 18:49.082
She gives you light.

18:49.223 --> 18:51.205
Now, you must
return the favor

18:51.293 --> 18:52.691
with your faith.

18:52.779 --> 18:53.769
Demanitus,

18:53.857 --> 18:55.373
I don't think
I have it.

18:55.461 --> 18:57.027
It's not that you need
to have faith,

18:57.115 --> 18:58.175
it's that you need to

18:58.263 --> 19:01.513
find the faith
you already have, think...

19:01.600 --> 19:02.683
<i>It's a riddle!</i>

19:02.771 --> 19:04.268
<i>No one tell me
the answers, I got this.</i>

19:04.356 --> 19:06.388
<i>A mushroom!
You were great!</i>

19:07.721 --> 19:09.068
I do have faith.

19:09.156 --> 19:11.005
I've always had
faith in Rapunzel.

19:13.208 --> 19:15.869
Oh no... no, no...

19:15.957 --> 19:17.191
- ...oh no...
- No!

19:17.279 --> 19:18.300
Please stay,
Demanitus!

19:18.388 --> 19:19.702
I have so many
questions!

19:19.790 --> 19:21.305
H-how does my
hair work,

19:21.393 --> 19:23.129
uh, what does
the MoonStone do...

19:23.217 --> 19:25.366
Questions you must
answer yourself...

19:25.617 --> 19:28.433
I waited millennia in this
monkey to meet the Sun-Drop.

19:28.559 --> 19:30.418
I have faith in you.

19:47.601 --> 19:49.583
- Blondie, you're going to save us.
- How?!

19:49.694 --> 19:50.711
I don't know.

19:50.799 --> 19:52.040
But I've always
believed in us.

19:52.128 --> 19:53.442
I've always
believed in you.

20:22.136 --> 20:25.871
Well, looks like my birthday
wish came true.

20:27.565 --> 20:28.957
That was...

20:29.045 --> 20:32.828
- Don't say it...
- A-maze-ing!

20:33.060 --> 20:35.169
Oh, there it was.

20:39.246 --> 20:40.394
See ya, Vigor.

20:40.669 --> 20:42.083
It's been...

20:42.171 --> 20:43.247
educational.

20:51.945 --> 20:55.332
- Well, shall we...
- Wait! Wait, please!

20:57.849 --> 20:59.410
Vigor said...

20:59.498 --> 21:01.808
he wanted you
to have this.

21:05.524 --> 21:07.806
Unfortunately...

21:08.074 --> 21:09.113
it is free.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.682
No, no, take it.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.842
I think I owe him.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.597
If you insist.

21:14.092 --> 21:15.551
Ah!

21:17.000 --> 21:19.282
Blondie. I gotta say, this
has been the weirdest,

21:19.370 --> 21:21.218
best birthday
I've ever had.

21:21.306 --> 21:23.910
Now c'mon, we got a
Dark Kingdom to get to.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.144
And then Vigor said,

21:27.232 --> 21:29.785
"For I am
Demanitus!"

21:29.873 --> 21:32.605
Now this is a monkey
talking, by the way.

21:32.878 --> 21:35.722
So he took us to a maze,
and-and there were riddles.

21:35.810 --> 21:38.535
Oh, Cass, Cass! You know
how much I love riddles!

21:38.623 --> 21:40.791
Oh! This one, I had to
put my arm in a wall,

21:40.879 --> 21:42.254
totally figured
it out.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.652
<i>"At the end
of Rapunzel's journey,</i>

21:44.740 --> 21:48.023
<i>one of her party
shall turn against her."</i>

21:50.469 --> 21:53.485
Pascal, Pascal,
do the face again...

21:55.189 --> 21:57.337
That's the one!
That's the face, oh!
