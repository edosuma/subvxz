00:19.990 --> 00:22.092
[Dawn] <i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:22.126 --> 00:26.963
[man] Fuck.

00:26.998 --> 00:28.765
[screaming]

00:28.766 --> 00:29.634
Nice teamwork.

00:29.634 --> 00:31.135
You've only been with us
four months.

00:31.169 --> 00:32.203
You ready to quit yet?

00:32.235 --> 00:34.304
No retreat. No surrender.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.805
I don't think
we got introduced.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.899
I'm Rose.

00:36.899 --> 00:38.174
[Dick] <i>Picked her up
the day before yesterday.</i>

00:38.176 --> 00:39.643
-Who is she?
-Deathstroke's daughter.

00:39.677 --> 00:41.478
Deathstroke is why
we shuttered this place.

00:41.512 --> 00:43.148
Why don't you
give Garth a chance?

00:43.182 --> 00:45.950
I'm not really into
his whole Atlantean
"live for the moment" thing.

00:45.982 --> 00:47.351
[Garth] Donna.

00:47.384 --> 00:50.121
You're asking me to choose
between my destiny and you.

00:50.154 --> 00:52.856
Maybe they're the same thing.

00:52.890 --> 00:57.195
[gunshot]

00:57.228 --> 00:58.563
[Donna] Garth!

00:58.595 --> 01:00.831
[Dick] <i>We're gonna
hunt this fucker down</i>

01:00.865 --> 01:02.432
<i>and make him pay.</i>

01:02.466 --> 01:04.036
[Dick] You want that one,
you're gonna have
to fight me for it.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.704
-I'm Dick.
-The fuck you doing
with my brother's record?

01:06.737 --> 01:09.307
-What are you talking about?
-Deathstroke killed my brother.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.308
<i>Rumor was he fell in
with the wrong crowd.</i>

01:11.341 --> 01:12.644
<i>He's Jericho.</i>

01:12.677 --> 01:15.677
<i>If this record is here,
then my brother was here.</i>

01:18.983 --> 01:20.784
[police sirens wailing]

01:20.817 --> 01:22.768
[music plays]

01:44.841 --> 01:46.492
[inaudible]

02:07.664 --> 02:09.233
[screams] Stop!

02:09.266 --> 02:13.467
[sirens wailing distortedly]

02:26.116 --> 02:29.116
[distorted laughter]

02:37.228 --> 02:39.695
[sirens continue wailing]

02:39.729 --> 02:41.532
[screams]

02:41.566 --> 02:46.216
[music continues on headphones]

02:53.311 --> 02:55.260
[music fades]

03:11.527 --> 03:13.629
Hey.

03:13.663 --> 03:14.748
Work done?

03:18.269 --> 03:19.995
What kind of friends?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.977
Girlfriends or boyfriends?

03:26.010 --> 03:29.019
Everyone likes a guy who
finishes their homework.

03:37.780 --> 03:40.187
Be careful, huh?

03:48.299 --> 03:52.649
[music resumes on headphones]

03:58.710 --> 04:01.177
Hey. Look what the surf
dragged in.

04:01.211 --> 04:04.215
I was beginning to think
you blew us off.

04:04.247 --> 04:06.450
He says,
"Homework, it never ends."

04:06.484 --> 04:07.885
Ah, it did for me.

04:07.919 --> 04:10.388
One day I woke up,
no school, no books.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.256
Weren't you expelled?

04:12.289 --> 04:13.390
Some say.

04:13.424 --> 04:15.926
[Dick chuckles]

04:15.961 --> 04:19.329
Well, Stereolab released
a new Japanese pressing today.

04:19.362 --> 04:22.233
-[Dawn] Twelve inch?
-Twelve inch and the LP.

04:22.266 --> 04:25.536
Both on clear vinyl.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.072
[Dawn] A little profanity.

04:27.105 --> 04:30.307
-He says,
"Take all my money, please."
-Sure.

04:30.341 --> 04:31.576
Okay, record geeks,

04:31.608 --> 04:33.612
come back to the party, please.

04:34.915 --> 04:37.024
Oh, nice toss.

04:44.288 --> 04:46.257
You okay?

04:46.290 --> 04:48.391
I hate this.

04:48.425 --> 04:51.596
This is the only way. Trust me.

04:51.629 --> 04:54.898
If you start feeling weird,
just think about Garth.

04:54.932 --> 04:57.000
I just like the kid.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.435
So do I.

04:58.468 --> 05:02.372
But he's Deathstroke's son.

05:02.406 --> 05:05.406
Are we sure of that?

05:10.281 --> 05:12.281
He's the one.

05:14.418 --> 05:17.567
[theme music playing]

05:28.665 --> 05:30.233
[Hank] So there I was,

05:30.266 --> 05:32.170
sixth grade, braces,

05:32.204 --> 05:35.572
doing the full Spanish version
of the <i>Macarena...</i>

05:35.574 --> 05:37.040
-the whole five-minute version.
-[Dawn] Mmm-hmm.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.776
Tiffani Hernandez
and her friends are

05:38.810 --> 05:41.144
sitting there, laughing at me
while I'm doing this thing,

05:41.144 --> 05:42.345
dancing my heart out.

05:42.346 --> 05:44.482
And I swore then and there...

05:44.514 --> 05:46.350
I'd never dance again.

05:46.384 --> 05:48.752
-Never?
-[Hank] Never, ever.

05:48.786 --> 05:50.853
[Dick] Hey, that's
a cool little cuff thing.

05:50.887 --> 05:52.021
The Eye of Horus.

05:52.055 --> 05:54.324
Where'd you get that?

05:54.358 --> 05:56.192
He said,
"It was a birthday gift."

05:56.226 --> 05:58.995
Who from?

05:59.028 --> 06:03.067
His dad.

06:03.100 --> 06:07.149
Is he still in the picture?

06:09.072 --> 06:12.108
Hey, I get it.

06:12.141 --> 06:14.043
Not everyone has a family

06:14.077 --> 06:17.949
you want to talk about.

06:17.982 --> 06:21.651
[Dick] I was raised
by a borderline psychopath.

06:21.685 --> 06:26.685
We don't get to choose
our fathers.

06:30.127 --> 06:34.833
[Dawn] He said,
his dad was a war hero.

06:34.865 --> 06:39.865
Before he was born,
his dad was in the army.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.910
[nurse] Major Slade Wilson.

06:45.944 --> 06:48.478
[Dawn] <i>"He was part of
a special unit called H.I.V.E."</i>

06:48.512 --> 06:52.149
Try to relax.

06:52.182 --> 06:55.084
[groans softly]

06:55.119 --> 06:56.769
[screaming]

07:03.160 --> 07:04.509
[panting]

07:10.834 --> 07:15.185
Tell us where the others are.

07:17.774 --> 07:19.976
We tried everything.

07:20.009 --> 07:22.110
Just kill him.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.901
[man grunts]

08:03.454 --> 08:05.055
[machine gunfire]

08:05.088 --> 08:06.088
Ahhh!

08:51.335 --> 08:55.272
You look tired.

08:55.306 --> 08:57.855
You'll revive me.

09:03.046 --> 09:05.115
Where's Jericho?

09:05.149 --> 09:06.499
Backyard.

09:11.489 --> 09:12.688
Go slow.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
Hey.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.174
You're home.

09:36.780 --> 09:39.383
I'm sorry
I missed your birthday.

09:39.416 --> 09:42.452
-No biggie.
-Hey.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.654
It is...

09:44.688 --> 09:45.688
to me.

09:54.659 --> 09:57.735
You never take that off.

09:57.769 --> 09:59.269
Come here.

10:03.740 --> 10:07.410
It kept me safe during battle.

10:07.445 --> 10:11.794
Now it'll keep you safe, too.

10:14.585 --> 10:16.085
Come here.

10:22.759 --> 10:24.710
I missed you.

10:31.903 --> 10:35.740
What's he doing now?

10:35.773 --> 10:38.743
[Dawn] He doesn't know.

10:38.775 --> 10:41.678
They don't talk.

10:41.711 --> 10:46.711
He hasn't lived with them
in a few years.

10:51.855 --> 10:53.355
Fresh one?

10:57.293 --> 10:58.943
Why's that?

11:02.399 --> 11:03.835
[Dawn] "Everything changed

11:03.868 --> 11:06.903
after my dad retired
from the military.

11:06.937 --> 11:10.640
He went into business
with a buddy of his.

11:10.674 --> 11:12.576
A man named Wintergreen."

11:12.610 --> 11:15.309
[knocking at door]

11:17.700 --> 11:19.582
Hey, kiddo.

11:19.616 --> 11:22.317
Is your dad ready?

11:25.288 --> 11:27.958
[Slade] Let's go.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.494
[Dawn] <i>His dad said
their new business was</i>

11:29.494 --> 11:34.494
<i>risk assessment
for an insurance company.</i>

11:35.332 --> 11:39.903
He went from hardly home
to nearly never.

11:39.937 --> 11:41.586
And then...

11:57.120 --> 11:58.155
Dad!

11:58.188 --> 12:02.625
[man] How was Omaha,
Mr. Wilson?

12:02.659 --> 12:05.360
Sit the fuck down.

12:08.532 --> 12:09.633
What do you want?

12:09.667 --> 12:11.769
The Brussels situation.

12:11.802 --> 12:14.938
We need to know the buyer.

12:14.971 --> 12:17.741
-You've made a mistake.
-Slade.

12:17.774 --> 12:20.077
It's okay, honey.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.846
These people are
going to leave now.

12:21.879 --> 12:24.414
There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

12:24.447 --> 12:26.548
Dad, please...

12:33.191 --> 12:36.225
-Are you okay?
-Jericho?

12:36.259 --> 12:37.894
[both shriek]

12:37.928 --> 12:40.798
No. Call 911!

12:40.831 --> 12:43.833
Oh, God. Okay. Just...
You're gonna be fine.

12:43.868 --> 12:48.668
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.

13:04.422 --> 13:09.422
When he came home
from the hospital,
his dad was gone.

13:15.966 --> 13:20.804
"We all have
family stories, right?"

13:20.837 --> 13:23.374
That's a rough one, Jericho.

13:23.407 --> 13:24.907
I'm sorry.

13:30.148 --> 13:33.051
To fucked-up families.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.519
-Only ones we've ever known.
-[Dick] Cheers.

13:36.553 --> 13:39.104
[Dawn] To family.

13:53.770 --> 13:55.306
Meet Wintergreen, aka

13:55.340 --> 13:57.642
William Randolph Wintergreen,
Special Forces.

13:57.676 --> 13:59.845
Slade ran into him
on a UN mission in Bosnia.

13:59.878 --> 14:03.114
Uncle Wintergreen
was also Slade's best man
at his wedding.

14:03.147 --> 14:05.482
The insurance job was
just a cover for assassin work.

14:05.517 --> 14:07.351
Wintergreen was
the main contact for clients

14:07.384 --> 14:09.587
looking to hire Slade
aka Deathstroke.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.890
We ran Wintergreen
through Bruce's
facial recognition software.

14:12.924 --> 14:16.059
Pulled up an address
in Bernal Heights.
House looks lived in.

14:16.094 --> 14:17.128
We should move now.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.397
No recon first?

14:19.397 --> 14:20.899
This is Deathstroke
we're talking about.

14:20.899 --> 14:23.134
I want to know
what kind of shitstorm
we're walking into.

14:23.134 --> 14:25.736
Look, I know we all want
this over as soon as possible.

14:25.770 --> 14:27.972
I just don't want to miss him
if we have a chance now.

14:27.972 --> 14:31.542
We catch this Wintergreen guy,
I say we cut ties with Jericho.

14:31.575 --> 14:32.743
Leave him out of this.

14:32.743 --> 14:34.245
[Hank] Dawn's right.

14:34.278 --> 14:38.182
We got what we wanted.

14:38.216 --> 14:41.216
Let's get Wintergreen.

14:51.129 --> 14:52.830
They knew we were coming.

14:52.863 --> 14:56.301
Oh, there's no way.
We moved too fast.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.570
Or maybe sweet Jericho
played us.

14:58.602 --> 15:00.904
He hates his dad.
You were there when he told us.

15:00.937 --> 15:02.474
More like love-hate.

15:02.506 --> 15:05.676
Either way, I say we party
with young Jericho again.

15:05.708 --> 15:06.744
See where it takes us.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.678
[Hank] I'm still with Dawn
on this.

15:08.678 --> 15:09.581
I'm done playing that kid.

15:09.581 --> 15:11.014
Since when is
separating children

15:11.048 --> 15:13.517
from their psychopath parents
a bad thing?

15:13.549 --> 15:14.751
We're doing him a favor.

15:14.784 --> 15:17.053
We're not exactly
Child Services.

15:17.087 --> 15:19.722
[Donna] Maybe you forgot
what his dad did.

15:19.756 --> 15:20.825
Garth is dead.

15:20.857 --> 15:23.027
Nobody's forgotten.

15:23.059 --> 15:24.696
None of us.

15:24.729 --> 15:28.166
But maybe we've taken it
far enough with him.

15:28.198 --> 15:29.567
We'll find another way.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.570
So I'll just stand here
and wait for this big idea?

15:32.604 --> 15:35.806
I said "we".
You'll be a part of it, too.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.644
Can't wait.

15:40.677 --> 15:43.827
I'll go tell Jericho.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.768
[Wintergreen] Titans.

16:04.802 --> 16:06.136
They're like ants.

16:06.169 --> 16:09.340
Kill one, more come.

16:09.374 --> 16:12.711
The job you were hired to do,
you need to finish it.

16:12.744 --> 16:14.845
And you need to figure out
how they trailed us.

16:14.879 --> 16:16.678
Already did.

16:21.451 --> 16:24.020
Your son's hanging out
with a new crowd.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.390
They may be
milking him for information.

16:26.423 --> 16:28.592
He doesn't know anything.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.995
[Wintergreen]
You'd be surprised
what a kid can pick up.

16:31.028 --> 16:32.163
They're sponges,

16:32.196 --> 16:33.631
all ears and eyes.

16:33.664 --> 16:36.734
Who knows what information
he has stored up
waiting to spill.

16:36.735 --> 16:40.270
Leave Jericho out of it.

16:40.304 --> 16:44.475
It's your call.

16:44.508 --> 16:45.857
Let's go.

16:57.687 --> 16:59.023
Jillian...

16:59.056 --> 17:01.755
Good, you're here.

17:16.106 --> 17:17.375
What's up with the entourage?

17:17.375 --> 17:18.710
You get a promotion?

17:18.710 --> 17:23.710
As you know, our work here
sometimes ruffles feathers.

17:24.648 --> 17:26.814
There's something
you need to know...

17:26.817 --> 17:29.153
about Garth being shot.

17:29.186 --> 17:33.523
He wasn't the target.

17:33.557 --> 17:34.757
Show me.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.707
It was me.

17:49.707 --> 17:51.910
I'm so sorry.

17:51.910 --> 17:55.913
All I ever wanted to do
was lookout
for your best interests...

17:55.913 --> 17:59.115
and I brought tragedy.

17:59.150 --> 18:01.117
It's not your fault.

18:01.152 --> 18:03.287
Two things are certain
in this world,

18:03.320 --> 18:05.990
good and evil.

18:06.022 --> 18:09.960
Your friend Garth was good.

18:09.993 --> 18:11.894
Yes, he was.

18:15.933 --> 18:18.935
I hope this means you'll be
leaving for Themyscira.

18:18.969 --> 18:21.872
Far from it.

18:21.905 --> 18:24.107
My work here is important.

18:24.141 --> 18:28.144
I don't run.

18:28.179 --> 18:30.814
We identified the shooter.

18:30.847 --> 18:32.650
His name is Deathstroke.

18:32.650 --> 18:33.884
Yes. We know.

18:33.884 --> 18:35.652
And I'll handle it.

18:35.652 --> 18:36.421
Why?

18:36.421 --> 18:37.588
Because I've been authorized

18:37.588 --> 18:40.057
to bring the issue
to a conclusion.

18:40.090 --> 18:41.425
You're pulling rank on me?

18:41.459 --> 18:43.461
Call it what you want.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.931
You're grieving
for a lost loved one.

18:45.963 --> 18:50.963
You're letting your emotions
color your actions.

18:51.134 --> 18:55.785
I know exactly what I am doing.

18:58.809 --> 19:00.811
I ordered the album weeks ago.
Where is it?

19:00.845 --> 19:03.213
You know, I'm sorry.
I just can't find it.

19:03.213 --> 19:04.883
Hey, what did they hire
you for, your ass?

19:04.883 --> 19:08.085
Because it definitely wasn't
your brains.

19:08.118 --> 19:13.022
Hey! Watch it, asshole!

19:13.057 --> 19:15.492
That was so rude of me.

19:15.526 --> 19:20.029
Here. Let me buy that for you.

19:20.064 --> 19:24.835
I am sorry for my outburst.

19:24.867 --> 19:27.671
Please accept this tip.

19:27.703 --> 19:29.205
Uh, thanks.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.208
I have a tiny penis.

19:31.241 --> 19:32.592
Good day.

19:39.147 --> 19:40.167
Here.

19:45.228 --> 19:48.729
Bye...

19:49.599 --> 19:52.863
Hey.

19:52.895 --> 19:56.046
What did you just do?

19:58.035 --> 20:01.184
[elevator bell dings]

20:04.942 --> 20:06.577
Follow me.

20:06.611 --> 20:08.579
Guys, I have great news.

20:08.613 --> 20:11.382
-You're rejoining the circus?
-[Dick] No.

20:11.415 --> 20:13.384
-You have to see this.
-You should have called.

20:13.417 --> 20:16.554
Something came up.

20:16.587 --> 20:19.923
Go ahead. Show 'em.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.959
He's asking, "Who?"

20:21.991 --> 20:25.061
"Who" what?

20:25.096 --> 20:26.364
Hank.

20:26.396 --> 20:31.047
-"Hank" what?
-Look at Jericho.

20:32.037 --> 20:35.306
I don't know
what this is about,
but I'm gonna--

20:35.338 --> 20:38.875
Dance.

20:38.909 --> 20:41.459
-Let's dance.
-What?

20:43.647 --> 20:47.548
My mom taught me this one.

20:49.554 --> 20:50.654
What's happening to Hank?

20:50.688 --> 20:54.325
I'm not very good at this.

20:54.357 --> 20:58.395
-[Hank chuckles]
-That's not Hank.

20:58.429 --> 21:00.096
So this is like

21:00.131 --> 21:02.967
Invasion of the Body Snatchers?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.435
Kind of.

21:04.470 --> 21:07.605
I can make my consciousness
jump into anyone
I make eye contact with.

21:07.638 --> 21:10.508
I control everything.
What they do,

21:10.540 --> 21:12.509
what they say.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.979
Hank has no idea

21:15.011 --> 21:16.779
I've rented him out.

21:16.814 --> 21:20.351
No way.

21:20.384 --> 21:24.054
"I hope this doesn't
freak you out."

21:24.087 --> 21:25.721
This is amazing.

21:25.756 --> 21:27.258
No.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.359
This is amazing.

21:29.393 --> 21:30.560
[chuckles]

21:30.595 --> 21:35.095
It sucks to have to give it up.

21:39.002 --> 21:41.439
Did I just black out?

21:41.471 --> 21:43.839
And pull my groin?

21:46.376 --> 21:47.845
What are you laughing at?
Did you just--

21:47.846 --> 21:50.445
[Dawn] He said, "Sorry."
He's sorry.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.055
Where did you get this power?

21:58.087 --> 21:59.423
[Dawn] He doesn't know.

21:59.423 --> 22:01.125
He thinks it's from the drugs
his dad took

22:01.125 --> 22:04.362
when he was in the military.

22:04.394 --> 22:07.932
How long have you had
this power?

22:07.965 --> 22:10.667
He doesn't know.
Since he was a kid.

22:10.701 --> 22:15.573
The only person he told
was his dad. Once.

22:15.605 --> 22:17.340
Shit. I'm gonna miss my lesson.

22:17.375 --> 22:18.909
Don't curse.

22:18.942 --> 22:22.179
We'll get there.
Just relax.

22:22.212 --> 22:24.048
[tires screeching]

22:24.080 --> 22:27.852
[honking loudly]

22:27.885 --> 22:30.953
[driver] You got
a problem, asshole?

22:30.988 --> 22:32.089
Dad, no. Come on,

22:32.123 --> 22:35.123
-he's not worth it --
-[Slade] Stay in the car.

22:37.828 --> 22:41.729
Yeah, let's go, tough guy.

22:50.207 --> 22:53.176
Thank you for your service.

22:53.210 --> 22:56.681
Have a nice day.

22:56.713 --> 23:00.314
[engine starts and revs]

23:12.195 --> 23:17.167
Guess he changed his mind.

23:17.201 --> 23:20.237
Was that you?

23:20.270 --> 23:23.106
Was that you?

23:23.140 --> 23:26.376
Did you control him?

23:26.410 --> 23:28.578
I was going to tell you.

23:28.578 --> 23:30.713
I don't know where
it came from.

23:30.747 --> 23:32.415
Me.

23:32.450 --> 23:35.185
It came from me.

23:35.219 --> 23:38.856
[screaming]

23:38.890 --> 23:41.192
You must have inherited
one of my...

23:41.224 --> 23:42.826
experiments. But...

23:42.861 --> 23:44.695
But yours is different.

23:44.729 --> 23:47.298
But it's kind of cool, right?
I can be like you.

23:47.330 --> 23:51.536
You will never be like me.

23:51.568 --> 23:54.105
If people ever found out
that you can

23:54.138 --> 23:57.407
do things like this,
they will take you away.

23:57.441 --> 23:59.442
Never show people

23:59.477 --> 24:01.278
what you can do.

24:01.278 --> 24:04.311
Promise me, Jericho.

24:10.221 --> 24:14.124
[Dawn] The only other person
he's told is his mom.

24:14.157 --> 24:18.496
Until now.

24:18.528 --> 24:21.566
Body-hopping.

24:21.598 --> 24:23.167
There's so much
you could do with that.

24:23.201 --> 24:26.201
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

24:31.142 --> 24:33.376
You were
supposed to break things off.

24:33.411 --> 24:35.413
I swear that's what
I went to do.

24:35.445 --> 24:37.448
But then I saw that...

24:37.480 --> 24:38.516
Jericho's got a gift.

24:38.548 --> 24:40.284
We agreed to cut ties.

24:40.317 --> 24:41.317
He needs us.

24:41.352 --> 24:42.886
A gift like that,
he's gonna use.

24:42.886 --> 24:44.355
It's too tempting not to.

24:44.388 --> 24:46.790
We can help him use it
the right way,
for the right reasons.

24:46.824 --> 24:49.000
It's awfully convenient,
Jericho's needs and yours.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.194
I thought we all wanted Slade.

24:50.194 --> 24:54.664
We do.
But not at Jericho's expense.

24:54.699 --> 24:56.333
Look at us.

24:56.366 --> 24:58.736
We're using a kid...

24:58.769 --> 25:01.940
a damaged, fucked-up kid
who just wanted some friends...

25:01.972 --> 25:05.643
to find his damaged,
fucked-up father.

25:05.675 --> 25:08.178
Slade took from us.

25:08.211 --> 25:10.949
He's still taking from us.

25:10.981 --> 25:13.683
What're you talking about?

25:13.718 --> 25:16.185
I wake up alone.

25:16.220 --> 25:18.756
I go to sleep alone, too.

25:18.789 --> 25:22.559
You're a ghost these days.

25:22.593 --> 25:24.862
I'm sorry.

25:24.895 --> 25:27.530
I know I've been
burning it both ends.

25:27.565 --> 25:29.500
And I know how this looks...

25:29.500 --> 25:32.569
me bringing him here
and taking him on.

25:32.603 --> 25:35.071
But I'm telling you,
he needs us.

25:35.105 --> 25:37.106
Needs us for what?

25:37.141 --> 25:38.742
A place to belong.

25:38.742 --> 25:40.243
He wants to be
out there in the world,

25:40.243 --> 25:41.346
to find his people.

25:41.378 --> 25:46.378
But for him, it's not gonna be
so easy. He's a freak.

25:46.416 --> 25:47.718
Just like us.

25:47.751 --> 25:50.221
[scoffs] Exactly.

25:50.255 --> 25:53.624
You do have
a saving-people problem,
Dick Grayson.

25:53.624 --> 25:54.724
I'm working on it.

25:54.759 --> 25:57.728
It's why I fell in love.

25:57.728 --> 26:00.463
If he stays,
we tell him the truth.

26:00.498 --> 26:01.833
How we all met and why.

26:01.865 --> 26:04.335
Cards on the table.

26:04.367 --> 26:07.518
"Cards on the table."

26:18.915 --> 26:21.766
This is who we are.

26:25.455 --> 26:26.506
Titans.

26:31.561 --> 26:33.830
I'm Dove.

26:33.865 --> 26:35.700
Hank is Hawk.

26:35.732 --> 26:38.883
Donna is Wonder Girl.

26:41.337 --> 26:43.875
And I'm Robin.

26:43.907 --> 26:48.413
We'd love for you to join us.

26:48.446 --> 26:53.446
But there's something
we need to tell you first.

26:53.785 --> 26:56.921
I haven't exactly been clear
with you.

26:56.954 --> 26:58.923
When we met
at the record store...

26:58.957 --> 27:01.425
I went there
to try to talk to you.

27:01.460 --> 27:06.460
I lied to you, because I wanted
to get information from you.

27:07.332 --> 27:10.468
Your father was
never an insurance agent.

27:10.469 --> 27:13.570
He's a paid assassin.

27:13.604 --> 27:15.906
He kills for a living...

27:15.940 --> 27:19.990
using the name Deathstroke.

27:21.045 --> 27:25.250
"How do you know
my dad kills people?"

27:25.282 --> 27:30.282
He killed a friend of ours
a few weeks ago.

27:31.021 --> 27:32.690
Your dad's a hard man
to track down.

27:32.722 --> 27:34.992
We hit a wall, so we decided...

27:35.026 --> 27:36.928
I decided to approach you

27:36.961 --> 27:39.330
to see if you can
help us find him.

27:39.364 --> 27:42.133
But that was all
before we knew you.

27:42.133 --> 27:44.535
Things are very different now.

27:44.567 --> 27:46.470
It's not about your dad now.

27:46.503 --> 27:49.273
We want you to join us.

27:49.307 --> 27:52.643
But first you need to know who
we really are.

27:52.676 --> 27:54.626
No more lies.

28:05.088 --> 28:10.088
He wants to know
if he's our friend
who his dad killed.

28:16.467 --> 28:19.135
Yes.

28:19.169 --> 28:20.368
Aqualad.

28:25.809 --> 28:29.646
He wants to know the truth
about his dad.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.329
Everything.

28:57.807 --> 28:58.843
[Adeline] Please stop.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.345
Whoever these "friends" are,

29:00.377 --> 29:03.114
if they're mixed up
with your father,
you can't trust them.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.667
-I lied to you...
-[huffs]

29:24.701 --> 29:27.171
...because you've
always idolized him.

29:27.204 --> 29:29.140
I know how much you love him.

29:29.173 --> 29:31.378
I didn't want to take that
away from you.

29:45.388 --> 29:46.695
Where are you going?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.462
Nobody stops your father.

29:51.496 --> 29:56.166
If that's what
your friends told you,
they're not your friends.

29:56.201 --> 29:59.800
No. Jericho, no! Please!

30:07.878 --> 30:10.914
He knows about you.

30:10.948 --> 30:14.117
What you did,
what you've become.

30:14.152 --> 30:18.189
And now he's moved out
to live with some people.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.590
I think they know
about you too.

30:20.592 --> 30:24.095
They're the ones who told him.

30:24.096 --> 30:25.663
I think I know who they are.

30:25.663 --> 30:27.496
Then fix it.

30:31.236 --> 30:34.071
You destroyed our lives.

30:34.071 --> 30:36.006
When you left, we had
to patch a life back together,

30:36.007 --> 30:38.742
Jericho and I,
however we could.

30:38.742 --> 30:42.599
We had to start from nothing.

30:42.599 --> 30:45.982
And we were happy.

30:46.017 --> 30:47.285
But that wasn't enough for you.

30:47.285 --> 30:49.019
You had to come back
and hurt us more.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.554
Ad, what do you want me to do?

30:50.587 --> 30:54.259
I want my son back.

30:54.291 --> 30:58.846
And I want you to go away
so you never hurt us again.

30:58.846 --> 31:04.130
I need you to promise me
that you'll do that.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.317
I understand.

31:15.346 --> 31:19.395
I never told him the truth.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.686
Because a son needs
to believe certain things
about his father

31:23.686 --> 31:27.857
in order
to become a man himself.

31:27.857 --> 31:28.925
I preserved in him

31:28.925 --> 31:33.925
what he need
to believe about you.

31:35.398 --> 31:38.068
Thank you.

31:38.102 --> 31:41.138
I didn't do it for you.

31:41.172 --> 31:44.321
You don't deserve it.

31:52.799 --> 31:55.752
This is your chance
to make it right.

31:55.752 --> 31:59.685
You won't get another one.

32:15.839 --> 32:20.190
[music playing on headphones]

32:29.119 --> 32:30.921
[popping]

32:30.921 --> 32:33.519
[Wintergreen] Hey, kiddo.
Long time.

32:35.159 --> 32:40.159
Sorry. I don't
read sign language.

32:40.830 --> 32:43.099
Okay, maybe I do.

32:43.134 --> 32:44.734
Now shut up and listen.

32:44.768 --> 32:46.671
Your father wants to see you.

32:46.704 --> 32:50.541
I know Slade hasn't been
much of a dad, but...

32:50.575 --> 32:53.076
these new friends
of yours, the...

32:53.109 --> 32:54.378
Titans?

32:54.412 --> 32:56.647
They seriously
call themselves that?

32:56.681 --> 32:58.348
The Titans were
tragic Greek figures,

32:58.348 --> 33:00.984
got their asses handed to them
by Zeus.

33:00.984 --> 33:03.484
Who names themselves
after losers?

33:06.799 --> 33:08.858
You need to know...

33:08.858 --> 33:12.643
they're feeding you lies.

33:15.099 --> 33:19.365
Go to this place, this time.

33:24.009 --> 33:29.009
You want to know the truth
about your dad,
let him tell it to you.

33:29.113 --> 33:31.548
You turned out good.

33:31.583 --> 33:36.583
Don't let those masks
mess with your head.

33:39.257 --> 33:43.257
Yeah, I know. Go fuck myself.

33:46.431 --> 33:49.733
I don't see how Jericho
seeing his dad is a good idea.

33:49.768 --> 33:53.471
That's why he came
to talk to me about it.

33:53.505 --> 33:55.440
He's afraid you're gonna be
disappointed in him.

33:55.472 --> 33:56.540
And what did you tell him?

33:56.574 --> 33:58.777
That you and I
would talk about it.

33:58.809 --> 34:01.244
Jericho needs your approval
for this, Dick.

34:01.278 --> 34:02.847
He won't talk to his dad
without it.

34:02.881 --> 34:05.816
He didn't need to tell us
at all, he could've just gone.

34:05.849 --> 34:07.884
Sure.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.820
But he didn't want
to lie to you.

34:09.853 --> 34:11.856
Cards up, right?

34:11.889 --> 34:14.726
It took Jericho
for someone to finally be
honest around here.

34:14.759 --> 34:17.061
You know,
maybe it doesn't matter
what we tell Jericho.

34:17.094 --> 34:18.697
So we use him again?

34:18.730 --> 34:21.764
-What's happening to you?
-You told me.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.135
You told me, "Be Batman."

34:24.168 --> 34:25.902
Remember?

34:25.936 --> 34:27.735
I was wrong.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.010
This version of you...

34:34.045 --> 34:37.280
What? You don't like it?

34:37.315 --> 34:42.315
You don't want me
to answer that right now.

34:52.963 --> 34:55.813
[cell phone chimes]

35:09.746 --> 35:12.746
[sent message chime]

35:41.880 --> 35:46.250
Hey. I think
you should go see your dad.

35:46.250 --> 35:49.284
I'll stay out of it.

37:12.168 --> 37:14.418
[both grunting]

37:33.757 --> 37:35.856
[Donna groans]

37:47.271 --> 37:49.371
[Donna groans]

37:55.278 --> 37:56.628
[screams]

38:14.724 --> 38:16.373
[Deathstroke]
Listen closely.

38:16.373 --> 38:19.086
I'm only going to say this once.

38:19.086 --> 38:22.802
Stay away from my son.

38:31.615 --> 38:33.865
[alarm beeping]

38:42.326 --> 38:44.530
[alarm blaring]
<i>Emergency beacon activated.</i>

38:44.530 --> 38:45.760
Donna.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.184
Hello, son.

39:34.445 --> 39:36.844
Donna. I'm here.

39:40.717 --> 39:43.568
It was Deathstroke.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.260
Jillian and the guards
are dead. Building's clear.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.762
We have to get her out of here.

39:51.795 --> 39:54.565
I'll meet you
back at the Tower.

39:54.599 --> 39:57.449
Take care of Donna.

40:02.907 --> 40:05.876
[Deathstroke]
You wanted the truth.

40:05.876 --> 40:09.947
So here it is.

40:09.980 --> 40:11.581
No more lies.

40:11.615 --> 40:15.318
This is who I am.

40:15.318 --> 40:18.952
This is who I've become.

40:26.896 --> 40:27.947
[sighs]

40:45.449 --> 40:48.820
I'm so sorry, son.

40:48.853 --> 40:51.856
Almost losing you to the Titans
made me realize...

40:51.889 --> 40:54.458
how much I've failed you...

40:54.458 --> 40:57.193
as a father.

40:57.228 --> 40:59.630
But you chose family first.

40:59.664 --> 41:01.699
I'm proud of you.

41:01.733 --> 41:06.733
You didn't make
the same mistake I did.

41:09.507 --> 41:11.641
And I will.

41:11.675 --> 41:15.726
No more secrets between us.

41:31.195 --> 41:35.164
I can hear your heartbeat.

41:35.164 --> 41:38.648
I can hear you breathe.

41:40.237 --> 41:45.237
I knew you were coming
before the thought
entered your head.

41:49.679 --> 41:51.748
I'm sorry, Jericho.

41:51.782 --> 41:53.317
Your father killed again.

41:53.349 --> 41:55.152
He has to be stopped.

41:55.184 --> 41:58.422
You did this?

41:58.456 --> 42:00.340
You told him we were meeting?

42:03.860 --> 42:06.331
Don't blame yourself, son.

42:06.364 --> 42:09.567
The Titans act like heroes,
but they're hypocrites.

42:09.599 --> 42:11.501
They used you.

42:11.534 --> 42:13.704
He's lying.
Don't listen to him.

42:13.737 --> 42:16.873
I can see right through you.

42:16.907 --> 42:20.978
You wear the pretty costume,
say all the right things...

42:21.012 --> 42:24.514
but I can see
what's underneath the mask.

42:24.547 --> 42:28.050
I can see your lies...

42:28.085 --> 42:29.619
the manipulation.

42:29.619 --> 42:32.288
Using a son's love
for his father

42:32.289 --> 42:35.492
to complete your mission.

42:35.525 --> 42:38.525
Step aside, Jericho.

42:44.434 --> 42:46.570
You killed my friends,

42:46.603 --> 42:49.139
you murder the innocent.

42:49.172 --> 42:51.007
You're a monster.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.677
As are you.

42:52.710 --> 42:55.713
Only of a different breed.

42:55.746 --> 42:57.748
In the pantheon of sins,

42:57.782 --> 43:02.251
murder is far more honorable
than betrayal.

43:02.286 --> 43:03.887
Watch closely, son.

43:03.920 --> 43:08.570
This is what happens to Titans.

43:12.262 --> 43:15.132
[Deathstroke yells]

43:15.164 --> 43:17.414
[both grunting]

43:34.217 --> 43:35.777
[growls]

43:37.146 --> 43:41.505
[Deathstroke] So emotional.

43:45.096 --> 43:49.295
That's why you lack control.

44:12.155 --> 44:14.255
[Robin groans]

44:17.393 --> 44:18.393
Argh!

44:31.407 --> 44:33.344
[Deathstroke] There it is.

44:33.376 --> 44:35.679
You feel it, don't you?

44:35.713 --> 44:36.713
Fear.

45:55.059 --> 45:57.608
I guess this is--

46:02.934 --> 46:05.634
-Dawn, I--
-Don't.

46:15.980 --> 46:18.248
I'll be in New York.

46:18.248 --> 46:21.251
If you ever need a place
to crash...

46:21.284 --> 46:22.284
Thank you.
