01:35.401 --> 01:36.469
Ah, bugger!

02:43.002 --> 02:44.537
Father please!

02:56.548 --> 02:57.383
Why?

02:58.751 --> 03:02.020
I was never good
enough for you.

03:02.022 --> 03:04.791
Look at you, the great Arth-yr.

03:07.726 --> 03:09.896
Nothing but a weak mortal.

03:11.331 --> 03:15.168
Morganna was right, you will
die with your false pride.

03:16.335 --> 03:19.303
You are nothing
but rotting flesh.

03:19.305 --> 03:23.343
I am Arth-yr Ddantgwyn,
damn you, your king!

03:26.078 --> 03:28.347
And you are no son of mine!

05:31.904 --> 05:32.972
It is time.

06:21.253 --> 06:22.088
My lord!

06:24.123 --> 06:25.125
Get me up.

06:26.159 --> 06:27.394
Get me up!

06:28.026 --> 06:29.293
My lord, it's over.

06:29.295 --> 06:33.367
Over? It's not over
until I say it's over.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.802
Saxon Bastards! Get me up!

06:37.736 --> 06:39.638
My lord, we have won.

06:41.574 --> 06:42.909
The day is ours.

06:49.548 --> 06:50.383
Water.

07:02.529 --> 07:03.562
Mordred?

07:05.697 --> 07:07.032
Where's Mordred?

07:08.101 --> 07:09.870
He's dead, my lord.

07:14.574 --> 07:16.076
I saw her again.

07:18.277 --> 07:19.111
My lord?

07:20.279 --> 07:22.815
The Lady, I saw her again.

07:28.555 --> 07:31.490
Bedivere, my most
loyal, my friend.

07:35.728 --> 07:38.632
I charge you with
my final command.

07:42.034 --> 07:43.502
Take Excalibur,

07:46.572 --> 07:47.774
back to the lake.

07:50.043 --> 07:52.546
It cannot be a force for evil.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.217
Yes, my lord.

08:13.232 --> 08:14.834
There is another...

08:16.969 --> 08:17.803
My lord?

08:19.906 --> 08:20.737
My lord?

10:37.443 --> 10:40.680
Heavenly father,
take thine sword.

10:43.349 --> 10:45.118
Protect your children

10:47.219 --> 10:51.056
and teach us the virtue
of peace and humility.

11:39.939 --> 11:44.110
My lord, I have seen your
glory and your sacrifice

11:45.277 --> 11:46.680
with my own eyes.

11:48.881 --> 11:51.818
Arth-yr, you were
the chosen one.

11:56.222 --> 11:57.057
My Lady,

11:59.425 --> 12:01.795
protector of the innocent.

12:03.829 --> 12:07.965
May those that posses
Excalibur be as valiant

12:07.967 --> 12:10.036
and righteous as my king.

12:12.238 --> 12:14.907
Allow no evil to gain its power.

13:03.189 --> 13:07.457
God damn them,
damn them, damn them.

13:07.459 --> 13:09.295
Damn them all to hell.

13:10.930 --> 13:13.833
Sir Kay come on,
come on Sir Kay.

13:15.133 --> 13:15.969
Take this.

13:20.605 --> 13:21.440
Sir Kay?

13:24.276 --> 13:26.445
I haven't heard that in...

13:27.647 --> 13:28.948
19 years.

13:31.283 --> 13:32.184
19 years.

13:36.689 --> 13:38.825
Leave me die, damn you.

13:41.493 --> 13:45.496
Come now, old friend, you
know I couldn't do that.

13:45.498 --> 13:49.868
Why not, look at me, I'm
rotting in my own skin.

13:50.603 --> 13:52.635
This is my penance.

13:52.637 --> 13:53.940
For what?

13:54.974 --> 13:57.006
For all the blood we shed.

13:57.008 --> 14:01.180
Nah-ah, we did all we could
for the people and our king.

14:03.416 --> 14:06.516
Yes, but for what?
I mean, look at us!

14:06.518 --> 14:09.153
We are strangers
in our own country.

14:09.155 --> 14:11.989
Just abandoned to
stew in our own shit.

14:11.991 --> 14:13.159
Yes, I know.

14:15.427 --> 14:19.263
But we kept the Saxons
out of Viroconium

14:19.265 --> 14:21.564
and we've had 19 years of peace.

14:21.566 --> 14:24.034
Yes but how long
will that last then?

14:24.036 --> 14:27.306
They are already
advancing in the east.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.540
Fuck this curse!

14:30.542 --> 14:34.077
Please, allow me to
bring Merlin to help you.

14:34.079 --> 14:37.517
No, you keep that
mad fool away from me.

14:38.651 --> 14:40.152
But he can help.

14:41.420 --> 14:43.156
I would rather die.

14:46.191 --> 14:48.360
Now then go my friend, go,

14:51.063 --> 14:52.065
leave me be.

15:10.782 --> 15:13.049
No, no, no, no!

15:13.051 --> 15:16.787
You save that for your
Christian friends!

15:16.789 --> 15:17.523
Now go. Go!

15:19.157 --> 15:21.426
Let me bloody die in peace!

15:39.445 --> 15:42.080
Go!

15:45.217 --> 15:46.052
Go!

15:50.422 --> 15:52.190
Goodbye old friend.

16:35.434 --> 16:36.336
Quick go!

16:38.336 --> 16:40.303
If he catches you,
he'll string you up.

16:40.305 --> 16:42.007
Oh yes, my lady.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.880
The guards are coming!

16:49.882 --> 16:50.980
Where's Harry?

16:50.982 --> 16:53.484
He said to meet
him at the tree.

16:53.486 --> 16:56.887
Well, my lady, the
pleasure has been all mine.

16:56.889 --> 16:59.592
I don't think so, quick, go!

17:06.164 --> 17:07.165
Hey, halt!

17:18.510 --> 17:21.911
Hey, old man, which
way did they go?

17:21.913 --> 17:22.748
Old man?

17:23.882 --> 17:27.917
What's wrong with you?
Can you not hear us?

17:27.920 --> 17:30.089
I saw nothing, boy.

17:30.855 --> 17:33.459
Boy? I'll show you.

17:36.761 --> 17:39.463
Well, what have we got here?

17:39.465 --> 17:41.665
You just struck
a lord's guard.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.699
That is a death
sentence in itself.

17:43.701 --> 17:45.169
I'm unarmed!

17:45.171 --> 17:46.171
We're not.

18:13.932 --> 18:14.767
Marius!

18:16.869 --> 18:17.703
Marius!

18:22.307 --> 18:23.409
Lucius! No!

18:28.380 --> 18:29.382
Who are you?

18:33.485 --> 18:35.351
We need to take him in.

18:35.353 --> 18:36.519
He's our defence for
not having caught

18:36.521 --> 18:38.356
those bastard thieves.

18:56.507 --> 18:58.609
I'm sure lord Antonius
will find a suitable

18:58.611 --> 19:00.213
punishment for you.

19:02.314 --> 19:05.248
That's if he lasts the night.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.252
If you last the night.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.231
No, please,
no, no, please, no no!

20:25.998 --> 20:27.299
This one.

20:28.834 --> 20:29.834
Please no!

20:57.129 --> 21:01.334
No, please, please no,
please, no no, no please!

21:06.505 --> 21:08.471
No, no, please, no!

21:35.100 --> 21:37.536
In the eyes of the beholder,

21:38.504 --> 21:41.007
let there be everlasting life.

21:42.106 --> 21:45.911
Life that is enriched
by the blood of youth

21:47.946 --> 21:49.615
and the soul of man.

21:55.187 --> 21:58.623
The Grail of Christ.
The power of life.

22:02.094 --> 22:04.796
Lord, in return for your gift,

22:07.032 --> 22:10.436
I present you with
the sacrifice of life.

22:36.894 --> 22:38.564
The blood of Christ.

23:42.628 --> 23:43.462
My son,

23:47.999 --> 23:50.469
drink from the cup of life.

24:43.154 --> 24:44.656
Go!

24:48.927 --> 24:51.497
Stand before me, Lord Antonius.

24:57.035 --> 24:59.705
The Saxons are nervous Antonius.

25:01.273 --> 25:05.644
They do not think you are
capable of uniting the armies.

25:06.944 --> 25:10.648
Do you enjoy the status
I provide for you?

25:12.116 --> 25:13.515
Yes, of course, my king.

25:13.517 --> 25:15.884
Then why do
you insist on testing me?

25:15.886 --> 25:17.053
My king, I...

25:17.055 --> 25:19.355
Have you
located the God Stone?

25:19.357 --> 25:23.728
Not yet, my king, we've been
busy with the gold situation.

25:24.895 --> 25:28.066
Gold,
gold has no value,

25:30.168 --> 25:34.540
but the order and subordination
it provides is priceless.

25:38.376 --> 25:39.543
Yes, my king.

25:39.545 --> 25:42.678
How
much have you lost?

25:42.680 --> 25:45.015
My King, I will retrieve
the money, I swear.

25:45.017 --> 25:47.316
We know who is responsible.

25:47.318 --> 25:50.522
- I
- asked you how much?

25:53.057 --> 25:56.228
We estimate 350
gold pieces my King.

25:58.697 --> 26:01.600
You
estimate? I see.

26:03.235 --> 26:07.970
And why is it so that you
can only estimate Antonius?

26:07.972 --> 26:10.674
Do we not have a counting clerk?

26:10.676 --> 26:14.647
Yes my King we do but the
clerk was involved in the theft.

26:17.682 --> 26:19.416
You have three
days to recover the clerk

26:19.418 --> 26:21.051
and the gold.

26:21.053 --> 26:24.055
Three days, my
king, but that's...

26:25.824 --> 26:26.892
Yes, my King.

26:28.427 --> 26:31.196
Good, now get out.

26:34.266 --> 26:36.432
Oh and lord Antonius.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.701
Yes, my king.

26:38.703 --> 26:40.769
Don't fail me again.

26:40.771 --> 26:42.941
Yes, my King.

26:44.342 --> 26:48.213
Come on you drunken
sod, get up, oi, come on!

26:49.480 --> 26:52.381
I've told you before about
coming home in this state!

26:52.383 --> 26:54.383
I'm always having to
clean up after your mess.

26:54.385 --> 26:55.619
Ah Lilly, stop nagging me!

26:55.621 --> 26:57.954
I loathe the day you
ever bloody met him.

26:57.956 --> 26:59.488
Ah, leave me alone.

27:03.761 --> 27:05.897
How long have we been out?

27:07.498 --> 27:09.865
I have no idea.

27:09.867 --> 27:13.204
Come on, we'd better
go and hide this.

27:18.809 --> 27:21.980
Well well, look
what we've got here.

27:23.148 --> 27:23.983
Get him!

27:30.788 --> 27:32.155
Owain! What's going on?

27:32.157 --> 27:33.957
Shut your stinking mouth!

27:33.959 --> 27:37.228
Not again, boy, I
lost you last night,

27:40.198 --> 27:41.497
but not again.

27:41.499 --> 27:42.666
You leave my boy alone!

27:42.668 --> 27:45.534
Oh, don't worry,
Mummy will save you.

27:45.536 --> 27:48.906
She's not my mother!
Now get off me!

27:53.545 --> 27:56.111
So, you are the dog who's
caused all this trouble.

27:56.113 --> 27:59.082
Owain hasn't caused any trouble,
it was that bloody Harry.

27:59.084 --> 28:02.854
Ah, Harry, that's
right, the clerk, oh yes.

28:05.390 --> 28:07.189
He is in trouble.

28:07.191 --> 28:10.429
But don't worry, you
aided and abetted.

28:11.830 --> 28:14.296
Can't wait to see what his
lordship has in store for you.

28:14.298 --> 28:15.198
What's he's
supposed to have done?

28:15.200 --> 28:18.567
Shut up wench! Take him out.

28:18.569 --> 28:20.004
No! No!

28:36.321 --> 28:40.590
How much would it cost
to go all the way with me?

28:40.592 --> 28:42.891
It would take all
the gold in the world.

28:42.893 --> 28:44.729
Now piss off! Get out!

29:41.253 --> 29:43.188
Hey, hey, I know you!

29:45.891 --> 29:46.959
Are you okay?

29:56.234 --> 29:57.069
Sir.

29:58.103 --> 29:59.004
Fuck off!

30:07.912 --> 30:08.546
My king!

30:10.148 --> 30:10.983
What?

30:12.350 --> 30:13.519
My king I...

30:19.423 --> 30:21.359
Hey, let me get that.

30:22.661 --> 30:24.162
Take some of this.

30:34.940 --> 30:37.809
Hey guards, he
needs water in here.

30:39.311 --> 30:40.546
He needs water!

30:48.385 --> 30:51.219
Sit down and shut up!

30:51.221 --> 30:53.057
Get the fuck off me!

32:20.778 --> 32:23.412
How did
you do that, old man?

32:23.414 --> 32:27.516
Call me old man again
and I'll show you.

32:27.518 --> 32:28.353
Sorry.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.595
Well?

32:40.065 --> 32:41.065
Well what?

32:42.600 --> 32:44.937
How did you do it?

32:45.804 --> 32:49.272
It's a trick I
learned many years ago.

32:49.274 --> 32:51.008
You were a soldier?

32:52.076 --> 32:54.211
Yeah, something like that.

32:57.515 --> 32:59.184
We're a dying breed.

33:05.824 --> 33:10.195
I hope the reason you're in
here is worth all of this.

33:12.796 --> 33:13.632
Well?

33:17.634 --> 33:19.334
My friend Harry thought
it would be a good idea

33:19.336 --> 33:22.173
to steal money
from lord Antonius.

33:23.641 --> 33:27.409
Stop them from forging an
alliance with the Saxons.

33:27.411 --> 33:30.146
I thought it wasn't a good idea.

33:30.148 --> 33:31.683
But he didn't listen.

33:33.852 --> 33:35.152
So, it's true.

33:38.555 --> 33:41.994
We are finally letting
this country go!

33:43.228 --> 33:47.198
Damn, I've been fighting
these bastards for years.

33:52.402 --> 33:54.406
So you were a soldier?

33:57.207 --> 33:59.043
Nah, I was a knight.

34:04.848 --> 34:06.915
In Arth-yr's court?

34:06.917 --> 34:08.152
Yes.

34:09.453 --> 34:11.789
What is your name?

34:13.625 --> 34:14.626
Bedivere.

34:20.732 --> 34:21.565
Yours?

34:22.766 --> 34:24.069
It's Owain.

34:32.210 --> 34:34.780
I know of you.
Well, the knights.

34:37.915 --> 34:41.085
I thought they
were just stories.

34:41.851 --> 34:43.920
Ever since I heard my first one,

34:43.922 --> 34:47.159
I've always wanted
to be a knight.

34:47.926 --> 34:50.761
I want to fight
for what's right.

34:53.464 --> 34:56.067
So, what is right then boy?

35:01.339 --> 35:02.574
I don't know.

35:05.475 --> 35:09.647
Your mother she, she'd
be very very proud of you.

35:12.884 --> 35:15.650
I wouldn't know.

35:15.652 --> 35:16.488
What?

35:18.656 --> 35:21.326
I don't know who my mother is.

35:22.292 --> 35:24.259
Your father?

35:24.261 --> 35:25.529
Same.

35:31.969 --> 35:33.805
How old are you boy?

35:35.540 --> 35:38.176
I'm 19 years old. Why?

35:46.618 --> 35:50.188
Jesus, look at me,
just look, look at me.

35:52.256 --> 35:53.390
Look at me boy!

35:55.026 --> 35:57.560
- What, get off me!
- I said look at me.

35:57.562 --> 36:00.464
Look at me, damn
you, look at me.

36:10.942 --> 36:12.677
There is another...

36:42.973 --> 36:44.806
There is another.

36:44.808 --> 36:45.643
What?

36:46.877 --> 36:50.247
I know who you are,
I know who you are.

36:53.584 --> 36:56.886
Come on
Boy, come on, get out!

36:56.888 --> 36:57.522
No!

36:59.589 --> 37:01.425
Back there, old man.

37:08.598 --> 37:10.966
Forgive me my king!

37:10.968 --> 37:12.067
Merlin!

37:12.069 --> 37:13.335
Sir Bedivere!

37:13.337 --> 37:14.638
Look for Merlin!

37:35.026 --> 37:39.364
So, you are the dog that
decided to steal from me.

37:40.765 --> 37:44.603
Do you have any idea what
trouble you've caused.

37:49.873 --> 37:51.540
Where is the rest of the money?

37:51.542 --> 37:52.708
There is no more.

37:52.710 --> 37:56.145
This is only half
of what was taken.

37:56.147 --> 38:00.317
Why would you be interested
in an old carcass like that?

38:01.386 --> 38:03.388
I just don't understand.

38:04.989 --> 38:07.292
She is a worthless whore.

38:08.526 --> 38:10.694
Leave her alone!

38:13.931 --> 38:16.031
But y ou have failed dog.

38:16.033 --> 38:19.100
Indeed you have caused
your people more harm.

38:19.102 --> 38:22.004
As a result taxes
will be doubled

38:22.006 --> 38:23.839
and you will be put to death.

38:23.841 --> 38:25.007
You can't do that.

38:25.009 --> 38:29.014
How fucking dare you,
I will do as I please.

38:30.415 --> 38:31.281
Your name will go
down in history as

38:31.283 --> 38:33.951
the dog that failed his people.

38:35.185 --> 38:35.953
Guards.

38:38.189 --> 38:39.554
Dispose of him.

38:39.556 --> 38:43.091
I swear in the eyes of
God, I'll be back for you.

38:43.093 --> 38:44.192
Get off me!

39:10.587 --> 39:14.589
Looks like you've had
enough, any last words?

39:14.591 --> 39:18.462
Yeah, you're going
to be first on my list.

39:47.558 --> 39:48.393
Arth-yr!

41:27.158 --> 41:29.357
Looks like
a storm is coming.

41:29.359 --> 41:30.194
Let's go.

42:13.036 --> 42:14.805
Hello Owain.

42:15.839 --> 42:16.673
Hello?

42:18.075 --> 42:20.143
You need not be afraid.

42:24.181 --> 42:26.315
Are you God?

42:26.317 --> 42:27.151
Am I dead?

42:31.022 --> 42:33.690
That depends on what you want.

42:34.692 --> 42:37.259
What is that?

42:37.261 --> 42:38.930
This is Excalibur.

42:40.163 --> 42:43.165
She belongs to the
heir of Arth-yr.

42:43.167 --> 42:45.002
The heir of Arth-yr?

42:46.803 --> 42:48.972
Search your past, Owain.

42:51.808 --> 42:53.275
You have been hidden
to allow yourself

42:53.277 --> 42:57.549
to grow outside of the palace
walls, out of arms reach.

43:00.183 --> 43:01.652
Hidden where?

43:03.453 --> 43:04.656
What palace?

43:06.924 --> 43:11.094
You are the son of Arth-yr
Ddantgwyn, King of the Britons.

43:13.263 --> 43:15.063
You must now take
your position as king

43:15.065 --> 43:18.833
and lead your people
to safety and peace.

43:18.835 --> 43:20.571
This is your destiny.

43:22.739 --> 43:26.408
Excalibur was created as
the guardian of peace.

43:26.410 --> 43:29.047
It must not be used for evil.

43:30.381 --> 43:35.283
I am charging you with the
safe keeping of this sword.

43:35.285 --> 43:39.323
Use it to protect your
people and to defeat evil.

43:42.426 --> 43:43.661
So...

43:46.730 --> 43:47.765
Bedivere was...

43:49.132 --> 43:51.134
Wait, how did I do this,

43:54.772 --> 43:56.873
I'm not a fighter, hello?

45:04.808 --> 45:05.442
Hello!

45:10.480 --> 45:11.716
Sir!

45:50.421 --> 45:52.920
I'm sorry, I found you
lying there so I thought

45:52.922 --> 45:55.093
there was something wrong.

45:57.294 --> 45:58.796
Something wrong?

46:03.868 --> 46:04.902
Am I in heaven?

46:06.270 --> 46:10.208
Ah, bit of a heavy night
then, what's your name?

46:11.542 --> 46:13.375
Who are you?

46:13.377 --> 46:15.509
Um, I'm Owain.

46:15.511 --> 46:19.783
You want to be careful,
you could have drowned.

46:23.286 --> 46:25.957
Wow, that is some piece of work.

46:34.931 --> 46:35.533
Can I?

46:36.634 --> 46:37.468
Yeah.

46:44.540 --> 46:45.977
It's beautiful!

46:52.683 --> 46:55.953
I must be getting
weak in my old age.

46:59.189 --> 47:03.190
God, what the hell, how
did you manage to get

47:03.192 --> 47:04.928
that stuck like that?

47:06.462 --> 47:09.533
You know, rough
night and all that.

47:10.935 --> 47:13.435
Well, good luck
to you my friend.

47:13.437 --> 47:18.040
It's gonna take an army
to get that out of there.

47:18.042 --> 47:19.477
Will you be okay?

47:20.477 --> 47:23.645
Yeah, I'll be fine, thank you.

47:23.647 --> 47:26.083
I wish I was young again.

49:25.602 --> 49:26.437
My king.

49:33.076 --> 49:35.478
Get up old man, I am no king.

49:38.815 --> 49:40.417
I am your friend.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.201
Who goes there?

50:44.281 --> 50:47.449
Go away before you
meet the same fate.

50:47.451 --> 50:49.219
- I know you.
- What?

50:51.187 --> 50:53.187
It's the dog from yesterday.

50:53.189 --> 50:54.723
What, no, no!

50:54.725 --> 50:56.857
It's a ghost, look at
him, look at his sword.

50:56.859 --> 50:58.893
Shut up, you idiot.

50:58.895 --> 51:00.131
Get him.

52:44.401 --> 52:47.638
Use it to
protect your people,

52:48.705 --> 52:50.306
and to defeat evil.

52:51.774 --> 52:55.512
Lucius, Lucius, get
back here, you bastard.

53:00.750 --> 53:04.587
Fuck, I thought we
finished you off yesterday.

53:07.024 --> 53:10.292
I told you I'd be
come back for you.

54:26.035 --> 54:27.270
Enter!

54:28.004 --> 54:30.404
My lord. We found the dog.

54:30.406 --> 54:32.040
We killed him, and
then we found him.

54:32.042 --> 54:33.507
He was unscathed.

54:33.509 --> 54:34.743
He was dead.

54:34.745 --> 54:36.911
And he had this sword,
it was too powerful.

54:36.913 --> 54:37.678
He slaughtered the men...

54:37.680 --> 54:40.080
Quiet! Stop talking.

54:40.082 --> 54:42.683
You are a trained guard.

54:42.685 --> 54:44.118
How many years have you served?

54:44.120 --> 54:45.386
Five, My lord.

54:45.388 --> 54:46.154
Then why lie!

54:46.156 --> 54:47.391
Silence!

54:52.395 --> 54:53.330
Impossible!

54:57.600 --> 55:01.771
I want that sword Antonius,
that shall be your redemption.

55:10.180 --> 55:11.882
What is your name?

55:13.183 --> 55:15.616
Lucius, my King.

55:15.618 --> 55:16.452
Lucius.

55:19.622 --> 55:22.959
Would you say that
you have failed me?

55:25.161 --> 55:25.893
My King, I...

55:25.895 --> 55:27.564
Yes or no Lucius.

55:32.569 --> 55:33.804
Yes, my King.

55:45.948 --> 55:47.617
I like you Lucius.

55:54.190 --> 55:55.022
Let's go.

57:02.993 --> 57:03.994
Hello dog.

57:07.163 --> 57:11.232
I see you've lost a
friend but gained an ally.

57:11.234 --> 57:13.701
That sword does
not belong to you.

57:13.703 --> 57:15.439
Oh, so it is yours?

57:16.540 --> 57:17.741
No, it is mine.

57:19.576 --> 57:22.012
I am Mordred, son of Arth-yr.

57:23.113 --> 57:24.181
Uh, me too!

57:26.216 --> 57:27.049
Guards.

57:28.084 --> 57:29.250
Get the sword.

58:32.381 --> 58:35.551
So, you are the
brother I never had.

58:38.355 --> 58:41.091
You are not worthy
of that sword.

58:42.692 --> 58:44.625
Aren't you
supposed to be dead?

58:44.627 --> 58:46.294
Aren't you?

58:46.296 --> 58:47.998
You are no king!

58:49.031 --> 58:50.198
And you are?

58:50.200 --> 58:52.900
Maybe, I know
of your plans to join

58:52.902 --> 58:55.303
forces with the Saxons.

58:55.305 --> 58:58.609
Indeed, you are
the son of Arth-yr.

59:00.243 --> 59:03.844
You have the same
compassion in you.

59:03.846 --> 59:06.015
It will kill you, brother.

01:01:02.498 --> 01:01:03.332
Mother!

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:11.073
Why?

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.875
Silence!

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:16.680
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:26.222
I have a brother.

01:01:59.922 --> 01:02:02.824
I've never seen
you drink before?

01:02:02.826 --> 01:02:05.161
Doesn't mean that I don't.

01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:10.931
You told me that you didn't
know who my parents were.

01:02:10.933 --> 01:02:12.035
Is that true?

01:02:13.268 --> 01:02:16.806
I've always done my
best to protect you.

01:02:18.607 --> 01:02:21.609
You were left over
there on the step.

01:02:21.611 --> 01:02:23.779
All wrapped in linen.

01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:27.951
Nearly threw the
slops out over you.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.789
You cried for days.

01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:37.324
Real pain in the arse.

01:02:37.326 --> 01:02:38.495
You still are.

01:02:41.263 --> 01:02:43.499
I never wanted kids myself.

01:02:45.134 --> 01:02:48.101
But there was
something about you.

01:02:48.103 --> 01:02:49.806
Something special.

01:02:52.908 --> 01:02:54.875
And when you opened your
eyes and smiled at me

01:02:54.877 --> 01:02:58.381
for the first time, I
couldn't let you go.

01:03:04.053 --> 01:03:08.225
You may not be from my own
loins boy but I am your mother.

01:03:14.964 --> 01:03:17.901
Do you know who
my parents are?

01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:24.207
Yes, I know everything.

01:03:33.649 --> 01:03:37.953
Last night, the
guards, they beat and killed me.

01:03:42.658 --> 01:03:43.859
Oh my boy!

01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:50.333
And then I woke at
the lake, I was dead.

01:03:52.935 --> 01:03:54.669
And then, I saw her.

01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:55.906
Who?

01:03:57.607 --> 01:03:58.909
The Lady.

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:03.046
She said that I am king

01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:07.949
and that I must
protect the people.

01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:10.921
No, but you're
not a fighter Owain.

01:04:12.055 --> 01:04:13.254
Thanks.

01:04:13.256 --> 01:04:16.393
I just don't
want to lose you.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.226
So, there is another.

01:04:20.228 --> 01:04:23.665
A bastard son who shares
the blood of Arth-yr.

01:04:28.004 --> 01:04:32.005
Merlin needed Arth-yr to
produce an heir to fulfil

01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:34.143
the prophecy, just as I did.

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.683
Arth-yr was known to
visit the whore houses.

01:04:42.685 --> 01:04:45.188
He must have hidden the child.

01:04:49.993 --> 01:04:53.393
When I saw the prophecy
that it was Arth-yr's son

01:04:53.395 --> 01:04:57.499
who held Excalibur, I
thought it was you, my son.

01:05:04.073 --> 01:05:05.475
Well it wasn't.

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:08.078
Was it?

01:05:16.752 --> 01:05:21.123
He cannot be allowed to
realise the power he has.

01:06:56.152 --> 01:06:56.987
Merlin!

01:06:58.788 --> 01:06:59.520
I knew it.

01:06:59.522 --> 01:07:01.654
Did you find the boy?

01:07:01.656 --> 01:07:02.491
I did.

01:07:04.493 --> 01:07:06.161
We must act quickly.

01:07:16.705 --> 01:07:18.239
Get those two.

01:07:32.187 --> 01:07:32.886
Take her.

01:07:32.888 --> 01:07:35.188
Oh no please no!

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.656
Her, on the slab.

01:07:36.658 --> 01:07:38.193
No please, no!

01:07:47.669 --> 01:07:48.604
Ssshht...

01:07:52.207 --> 01:07:55.277
If you want to see
your sister alive,

01:07:56.444 --> 01:07:59.049
you'll do exactly what I say.

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:02.917
This is Ada.

01:08:02.919 --> 01:08:05.319
She's thinking of staying
with us for a few nights.

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:10.191
Could you make the spare
room up for me please?

01:08:10.193 --> 01:08:11.892
Where are your belongings?

01:08:11.894 --> 01:08:13.893
I have none.

01:08:13.895 --> 01:08:16.564
Oh, do you mind if I join you?

01:08:17.934 --> 01:08:19.602
Be my guest.

01:08:21.537 --> 01:08:24.971
So what brings
you to these parts?

01:08:24.974 --> 01:08:28.942
I'm just passing
through, I'm on an errand.

01:08:28.944 --> 01:08:30.810
Go on.

01:08:30.813 --> 01:08:32.444
That's it.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:33.282
Oh.

01:08:34.183 --> 01:08:35.316
Well it's not safe out there.

01:08:35.318 --> 01:08:39.089
You could find yourself
in a lot of trouble.

01:09:16.925 --> 01:09:19.528
It won't be long now my dear.

01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:31.372
So, where are you from?

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:36.880
Uhm, quite far away.

01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:47.156
I've never heard the name
Ada before, it's pretty.

01:09:53.028 --> 01:09:55.497
Show me to my room.

01:11:49.178 --> 01:11:51.078
What the hell's
happened to you?

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.079
The girl, Ada, where is she?

01:11:53.081 --> 01:11:54.781
I haven't seen her.

01:11:54.783 --> 01:11:57.084
Frightened her off did you love?

01:11:57.086 --> 01:11:58.755
Oi! She hasn't paid!

01:12:45.233 --> 01:12:48.735
I have your sword,
now let her go.

01:12:48.737 --> 01:12:50.340
- Yes.
- Let her go.

01:12:53.142 --> 01:12:54.274
You have done well.

01:12:54.276 --> 01:12:58.177
And for that, you
will be rewarded.

01:12:58.179 --> 01:13:00.015
Now give me the sword.

01:13:22.571 --> 01:13:25.475
I did what you
asked, let her go!

01:13:33.549 --> 01:13:35.752
- No, no, no, no!
- Guards!

01:13:39.889 --> 01:13:40.790
No!

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:09.919
You are free.

01:14:12.254 --> 01:14:14.924
Now go, before I change my mind.

01:14:15.925 --> 01:14:17.827
Guards, get rid of her.

01:15:25.627 --> 01:15:26.727
Where's the sword?

01:15:26.729 --> 01:15:29.663
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
it's all my fault.

01:15:29.665 --> 01:15:30.830
What?

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:32.065
They told me I had
to take the sword

01:15:32.067 --> 01:15:33.400
and if I didn't they
would kill my sister.

01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:34.433
Who did?

01:15:34.435 --> 01:15:36.203
- Morganna.
- And your sister?

01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:44.714
Look, we have to find that
sword or we are all in danger.

01:15:46.415 --> 01:15:49.051
Do you think you can help me?

01:15:50.419 --> 01:15:53.122
I need you to show me the way.

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:03.032
Stop.

01:16:08.703 --> 01:16:09.335
This way.

01:16:09.337 --> 01:16:10.572
Wait!

01:16:12.707 --> 01:16:14.710
There's something there.

01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:21.684
Ada, move, now.

01:16:50.446 --> 01:16:52.614
I've been expecting you.

01:16:55.818 --> 01:16:57.253
Thank you Jakkar.

01:17:09.764 --> 01:17:11.130
Your highness.

01:17:11.132 --> 01:17:13.301
You, you must be Merlin.

01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:16.770
You've heard of me.

01:17:16.772 --> 01:17:18.437
Yes, Bedivere.

01:17:18.439 --> 01:17:20.942
Yes, my old friend Bedivere.

01:17:22.243 --> 01:17:23.078
How is he?

01:17:26.415 --> 01:17:27.248
Oh, I see.

01:17:30.085 --> 01:17:31.319
You poor thing.

01:17:32.787 --> 01:17:34.855
Come. Follow me.

01:17:34.857 --> 01:17:36.792
We don't have much time.

01:17:41.964 --> 01:17:42.797
Come.

01:17:43.697 --> 01:17:46.102
Come, come, come, come, come.

01:17:56.178 --> 01:17:57.013
Ah, come.

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.019
My dear, tea?

01:18:21.002 --> 01:18:25.174
Now, Mordred, of course you've
already had a run in with.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:30.142
Cruel creature, power
hungry and evil to boot.

01:18:30.144 --> 01:18:31.477
You mean my brother!

01:18:31.479 --> 01:18:34.315
Yes, your brother,
half brother.

01:18:36.518 --> 01:18:37.717
But he's dead.

01:18:37.719 --> 01:18:40.887
Ah, your father
made the same mistake.

01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:44.391
As long as they posses the
holy grail, they cannot die.

01:18:44.393 --> 01:18:48.163
It can even bring people
back from the dead.

01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:53.202
You'll like this.

01:18:54.836 --> 01:18:55.470
You see?

01:18:56.572 --> 01:18:58.741
It's called the God Stone.

01:18:59.608 --> 01:19:00.976
Good isn't it?

01:19:02.845 --> 01:19:04.377
And what about the grail?

01:19:04.379 --> 01:19:06.245
You said it could
bring back the dead.

01:19:06.247 --> 01:19:09.449
Yes, my dear. But
it is not natural.

01:19:09.451 --> 01:19:11.120
Nor was her death.

01:19:12.487 --> 01:19:13.823
Please, help me!

01:19:18.193 --> 01:19:21.197
Your father sat
in the exact spot.

01:19:28.237 --> 01:19:31.538
These are your father's notes.

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.274
A very sharp student.

01:19:35.243 --> 01:19:36.978
My finest. My friend.

01:19:39.413 --> 01:19:40.882
For many years.

01:19:42.917 --> 01:19:45.517
Oh, I should have
found you earlier.

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:47.286
Taken you to the lake.

01:19:47.288 --> 01:19:48.588
But she's too clever,
that Morganna.

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:50.056
She'd have known.

01:19:50.058 --> 01:19:51.223
Is it possible?

01:19:51.225 --> 01:19:54.326
I've never tried.
It is not the way.

01:19:54.328 --> 01:19:55.864
I have to try.

01:19:57.332 --> 01:19:59.999
I knew he would break his
word, even if I'd brought him

01:20:00.001 --> 01:20:01.504
the sword in time.

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:05.038
Now, now, my dear.
You are not to blame.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.877
When dealing with
pure evil, well,

01:20:09.344 --> 01:20:11.413
one has very few options.

01:20:12.915 --> 01:20:14.914
What is this grail?

01:20:14.916 --> 01:20:17.085
It is the cup of Christ.

01:20:18.287 --> 01:20:20.052
It is said that those
who drink from it drink

01:20:20.054 --> 01:20:21.923
the blood of Christ.

01:20:22.657 --> 01:20:24.859
It gives life and youth.

01:20:26.627 --> 01:20:29.963
The grail was first
found by your father,

01:20:29.965 --> 01:20:31.698
but Morganna stole it
by mesmerising the king,

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.167
she's, she's such a sly witch.

01:20:34.169 --> 01:20:35.004
Vile.

01:20:36.404 --> 01:20:38.938
Since then she's hidden herself
away, plotting with her son

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.142
to find the three
beacons of light,

01:20:42.144 --> 01:20:44.847
The grail, Excalibur and this.

01:20:51.153 --> 01:20:54.420
There is nothing she
wouldn't do to get

01:20:54.422 --> 01:20:56.325
her rotten hands on it.

01:20:57.992 --> 01:21:00.226
So what happens when
you get all three?

01:21:00.228 --> 01:21:04.463
Well, it'll be the end
of the world as we know it.

01:21:04.465 --> 01:21:09.002
The God Stone allows me to
hide myself using mirages,

01:21:09.004 --> 01:21:11.172
illusions and apparitions.

01:21:12.306 --> 01:21:14.943
You've already met my friend.

01:21:19.747 --> 01:21:21.884
I see what Jakarr sees.

01:21:30.725 --> 01:21:33.862
I use the wolf,
she uses the snake.

01:21:35.029 --> 01:21:36.695
And what of the sword?

01:21:36.697 --> 01:21:39.699
Excalibur is more than
just a sword my lord.

01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:42.067
It's a gift of the lake lady,

01:21:42.069 --> 01:21:44.704
forged from the blades
of a thousand warriors.

01:21:44.706 --> 01:21:46.673
Lake lady?

01:21:46.675 --> 01:21:49.945
Yes. The siren,
the Lady of the Lake.

01:21:53.381 --> 01:21:55.550
Morganna told of a vision.

01:21:56.785 --> 01:22:00.219
She had foreseen that the
son of Arth-yr would conquer

01:22:00.221 --> 01:22:02.355
the world using all
three enchantments.

01:22:02.357 --> 01:22:04.524
I realised that she
was up to something.

01:22:04.526 --> 01:22:06.459
She wants power.

01:22:06.461 --> 01:22:10.730
The only way she could get it
was by manipulating Arth-yr

01:22:10.732 --> 01:22:13.165
into giving her a male heir.

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:16.069
Hence the arrival of Mordred.

01:22:16.071 --> 01:22:19.041
I hatched my own
plan and there he is.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.581
And what about my mother?

01:22:26.782 --> 01:22:30.352
She was chosen because
of her kind heart.

01:22:31.519 --> 01:22:33.386
Not long after you were
born she became ill

01:22:33.388 --> 01:22:34.520
and couldn't look after you.

01:22:34.522 --> 01:22:38.725
She came to me and asked
if I would take you.

01:22:38.727 --> 01:22:41.561
It was the last I
saw of her alive.

01:23:04.853 --> 01:23:06.151
Have you found them yet?

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:07.552
Not yet my king.

01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:09.722
We've searched the local
taverns, villages and caves,

01:23:09.724 --> 01:23:11.191
as you asked.

01:23:11.193 --> 01:23:12.361
Still no sign.

01:23:13.528 --> 01:23:17.563
My King, the army
awaits your command.

01:23:17.565 --> 01:23:21.101
Rally the men and then
meet me at the gates.

01:23:21.103 --> 01:23:22.602
And, General?

01:23:22.604 --> 01:23:24.070
Yes, my King?

01:23:24.072 --> 01:23:28.243
I trust you will do a better
job than your predecessor.

01:23:44.259 --> 01:23:45.525
Any sign?

01:23:45.527 --> 01:23:49.264
No, not yet,
but it won't be long.

01:23:51.867 --> 01:23:54.336
They cannot afford to hide.

01:23:55.804 --> 01:23:59.138
They have a day until
I set the world on fire.

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.208
A little more
patience, my son.

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:04.244
Once I have the God Stone,
you can do whatever you

01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:05.748
like to the world.

01:24:39.447 --> 01:24:41.347
Shouldn't you go
and talk to him?

01:24:41.349 --> 01:24:42.684
Ah, it's fine.

01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:47.453
It's a lot to take
in all at once.

01:24:47.455 --> 01:24:50.792
You don't seem surprised
by any of this.

01:24:52.193 --> 01:24:56.130
I've heard it all
before from the witch.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:04.369
I really shouldn't be
telling you this my dear.

01:25:04.371 --> 01:25:06.705
The race to save your
sister's soul is against you.

01:25:06.707 --> 01:25:09.475
The longer it goes the
less she's likely to find

01:25:09.477 --> 01:25:10.944
the light back.

01:25:10.946 --> 01:25:13.879
This is dark magic, my dear.

01:25:13.881 --> 01:25:18.450
It's unpredictable, but
both your hearts are strong.

01:25:18.452 --> 01:25:19.951
I have to go.

01:25:19.953 --> 01:25:24.225
Owain, my sister still has a
chance but we have to go now.

01:25:25.859 --> 01:25:27.095
Oh, uh, wait.

01:25:30.599 --> 01:25:32.134
Here, take this.

01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:35.901
I think you have earned
the right to bear

01:25:35.903 --> 01:25:37.672
your father's arms.

01:25:40.242 --> 01:25:42.241
Come with us.

01:25:42.243 --> 01:25:46.214
Oh, I'm afraid I'm just no
match for Morganna any more.

01:25:47.983 --> 01:25:49.982
We know each other too well.

01:25:49.984 --> 01:25:53.986
She'd work out any plan I
make, counter every move.

01:25:53.988 --> 01:25:57.358
That is why I waited
for you, my king.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.860
Here you are my boy.

01:26:01.862 --> 01:26:04.030
This was mine on
the battlefield.

01:26:04.032 --> 01:26:07.302
No enchantments,
just a strong blade.

01:26:08.603 --> 01:26:09.438
Oh.

01:26:12.407 --> 01:26:16.411
I am entrusting you with
the God Stone, my dear.

01:26:18.313 --> 01:26:21.150
Understand the
importance of this.

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:26.355
If they take this, well,
all of this is for nothing.

01:26:27.889 --> 01:26:29.722
I don't know how to use it.

01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:30.990
Yes you do.

01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:33.959
The stone will do as you ask.

01:26:33.961 --> 01:26:35.330
Breathe, my dear.

01:26:36.331 --> 01:26:38.200
Breathe. Control it.

01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:45.474
Wow.

01:26:46.608 --> 01:26:49.478
Now, you must go.
I wish you luck.

01:26:51.313 --> 01:26:55.315
Remember, it is not the strongest
sword that will triumph,

01:26:55.317 --> 01:26:57.319
but the strongest heart.

01:26:58.319 --> 01:27:00.719
And what about you Merlin?

01:27:00.721 --> 01:27:04.893
My king, ever since I looked
into your eyes as a baby,

01:27:05.926 --> 01:27:08.960
I knew there was good in you.

01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:11.864
You now have a great
responsibility.

01:27:11.866 --> 01:27:13.466
One that no one else can hold.

01:27:13.468 --> 01:27:15.804
It is yours and yours alone.

01:27:18.005 --> 01:27:21.475
Everything you see
before you is yours.

01:27:22.977 --> 01:27:24.880
Rule with a kind heart.

01:27:26.581 --> 01:27:27.416
I will.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.751
Goodbye child.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.002
Owain, come on!

01:28:31.712 --> 01:28:33.047
They're here.

01:28:35.015 --> 01:28:37.318
They've got the God Stone.

01:30:33.635 --> 01:30:34.870
Where is she?

01:30:43.978 --> 01:30:45.413
It is too late.

01:30:48.882 --> 01:30:49.984
Go!

01:30:55.956 --> 01:30:58.057
Where is she?

01:30:58.059 --> 01:31:00.058
They've taken her
through the hall.

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.160
There's still time.

01:31:01.162 --> 01:31:02.664
Run, run, run! Go!

01:31:11.339 --> 01:31:13.873
Hello again, brother.

01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:16.275
Those words
will be your last.

01:31:57.352 --> 01:32:00.055
Yield, and I'll be merciful.

01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:05.790
Give me the grail and
I'll even bring your

01:32:05.792 --> 01:32:07.661
beloved sister back.

01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:17.572
I've heard your
promises before witch, no!

01:32:23.411 --> 01:32:25.143
Time to die brother!

01:32:27.982 --> 01:32:29.251
Burn in hell!

01:32:30.652 --> 01:32:31.286
Mother!

01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:52.798
Oh, Grail of Christ,
you have the gift

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.669
of everlasting life.
