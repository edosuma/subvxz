First time we hung out, what did
I think of you?

00:26.509 --> 00:28.175
Yeah.

00:28.177 --> 00:29.376
When was that, was that the
night that...

00:29.378 --> 00:31.245
Come on, you're kidding.

00:31.247 --> 00:33.246
Remember I brought Willow over
to that apartment...

00:33.248 --> 00:34.515
you and Matt had in the East
Village?

00:34.517 --> 00:35.615
OWEN:
Yes, of course, I remember.

00:35.617 --> 00:37.551
OWEN: Let's see, I thought that
you were really hot...

00:37.553 --> 00:40.621
but also that you may murder me
in my sleep one day.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.755
HALLIE: Shut up.

00:41.757 --> 00:42.890
OWEN:
You want one tea bag or two?

HALLIE: That's it? You just...
you thought I was hot?

00:46.529 --> 00:48.762
OWEN: Yeah, I mean, I had never
seen you naked before.

00:48.764 --> 00:50.597

you missed L.A.

OWEN: Okay, I remember looking
at you that night...

00:56.806 --> 00:59.405
and thinking you weren't like
anyone I'd ever met before.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.408
OWEN: I thought that you were
very special.

01:01.410 --> 01:03.243
OWEN: Do you want honey?

01:03.245 --> 01:05.479
HALLIE:
One tea bag and yeah, honey.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.381
HALLIE: Aren't you gonna ask me
what I thought?

01:08.383 --> 01:11.651
OWEN: Oh, yeah, sure.

01:11.653 --> 01:13.687

01:13.689 --> 01:16.556
OWEN: Okay, here's your tea.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.559
You really need to get rid
of this couch.

01:18.561 --> 01:20.827
I can't do that, I'm sorry.
I like it too much.

01:20.829 --> 01:21.895
Well, it's old and it's
disgusting...

01:21.897 --> 01:24.231
and even Goodwill would reject
it at this point.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.500
So, I think it's time for you
to take it upon yourself...

me to, at all times of the day?

What?

02:26.629 --> 02:29.496
The Stephen Hawking movie.

well, you wanna know what
I do with my freedom?

in the East Village after some
party, and you and I hung out...

10:12.728 --> 10:14.059

going soon, too.

at Owen's.

get a ride?

10:38.152 --> 10:41.121
Yeah, I don't have a car,
I'm just Ubering for right now.

Oh, well, you want me to get us
one back to the mainland?

10:43.224 --> 10:46.259
I mean, I'm on the way to
Hallie's, you can drop me.

10:46.261 --> 10:48.861
Okay, um, but split it with
me...

expensive.

Aw fuck, they're increasing the
rent to this place in September.

11:37.912 --> 11:40.013
I'm not gonna be able
to afford this.

11:40.015 --> 11:41.114
I'm probably gonna have
to move?

11:41.116 --> 11:42.981
Ugh, I'm sorry, that's awful.

11:50.959 --> 11:54.059
Well, one way you could keep
living here...

is if I moved in officially.

12:20.222 --> 12:22.324
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my god.

12:25.026 --> 12:27.260
Hey... after you.

12:27.262 --> 12:28.964
Thanks.

12:31.031 --> 12:33.132
- Oh.
- Oh.

Okay.

I feel like nobody does.

12:49.084 --> 12:51.384
Yeah, me and Owen both did.

12:51.386 --> 12:53.252
What about you? What'd you move
out here for?

12:53.254 --> 12:55.889
Well, I've been living in New
York since school...

school in September.

Wow, I'm impressed.

13:02.998 --> 13:05.198
I've read maybe four whole books
in my entire life...

13:05.200 --> 13:07.266
and I wouldn't know how to
compare them.

13:07.268 --> 13:10.970
I wouldn't admit that.

to see you again.

How do your parents let you live
like this? It's inhumane.

Honestly, I want to get a bigger
bed, but it just feels...

15:00.114 --> 15:01.380
kind of symbolic at this point,
you know.

15:01.382 --> 15:04.284
Like I'm saying, "Guys, I'm here
to stay! I'm never moving out!"

15:04.286 --> 15:05.651

of keeps that dream alive.

happy to be here.

We shouldn't have sex right?

with you right now.

- Okay.

All right.

16:28.502 --> 16:30.470
I'm sorry about my twin bed.

did you cum?

Dude.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.260
Just tell me how quick was it?

16:55.262 --> 16:56.361
It was like 45 seconds.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.530
Oh, that's actually longer than
I would have guessed.

Yeah, you sound like Jimmy
Stewart...

17:05.373 --> 17:06.305
the way you're talking about
her.

17:06.307 --> 17:09.242
He legit just hooked up with
this girl...

17:09.243 --> 17:11.377

he loves her.

You're... it's less than 24 hours
ago and you're talking...

17:14.415 --> 17:16.648
about how she's your
quote-unquote future wife.

17:16.651 --> 17:17.583
- You fucking psycho.
- Aw...

17:17.585 --> 17:19.685
- You poor psycho.
- You think I just met her?

17:19.686 --> 17:22.554
She and I had this unbelievable
Before Sunrise-level night...

17:22.556 --> 17:24.489
five years ago, we just finally
reconnected.

No, you didn't, no,
you didn't...

17:26.294 --> 17:28.560
because she has no recollection
of that night ever happening.

17:28.563 --> 17:31.264

shouldn't talk, this guy...

17:33.767 --> 17:35.501
and said you wrote them about
me, so...

17:35.503 --> 17:38.571
All right, well, number one,
I had a very big crush on you.

17:38.573 --> 17:40.439
- Huge.
- Number two, it was ninth grade.

17:40.441 --> 17:43.242
Number three, the Dashboard
lyrics articulated something...

17:43.244 --> 17:46.312
that 14-year-old me wasn't able
to articulate at the time.

17:46.314 --> 17:48.313
Honestly, I haven't liked anyone
this much since...

17:48.315 --> 17:50.349
I dunno, since Rachel Flegelman!

17:50.351 --> 17:52.384
Flegelman, the girl, who every
time you guys did coke...

17:52.386 --> 17:53.486
would lick your butthole.

17:53.488 --> 17:55.254
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

17:55.256 --> 17:56.823
Hey, butthole licking is part of
the human experience!

17:56.825 --> 17:59.257

about that.

right now?

- You look great.

- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- Thanks... thanks, man...

18:12.373 --> 18:14.540
I mean, she asked me to move
in the other night...

18:14.542 --> 18:16.409
and I didn't know what to say...

18:16.411 --> 18:20.612
and that was obviously not a
good reaction on my part.

18:20.614 --> 18:22.380

meaning.

from my idea, it's not like
months or days different...

that he thought...

22:31.932 --> 22:34.566
we weren't together that we
were fully together.

I'm like, if we're not together,
what else are you doing?

23:44.738 --> 23:45.804
OWEN:
The parents loved it, though.

23:45.806 --> 23:47.907
They still have to show it
to the bar mitzvah boy...

23:47.909 --> 23:50.712
before we picture lock, but I
think that's just a formality.

24:00.921 --> 24:02.990
- Good morning.
- Uh-uh...

24:22.776 --> 24:25.910
You know, last week I read an
article that women in prison...

24:25.912 --> 24:28.080
are more violent than men when
it's that time of the month...

24:28.082 --> 24:29.782
they'll literally just start
beating each other up...

24:29.784 --> 24:31.717
and sometimes they even murder
each other...

24:31.719 --> 24:33.218
because of their fucking
periods.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.822
When did we say about fast
talking in the morning?

24:36.824 --> 24:38.660
We don't like it.

24:39.861 --> 24:41.826
- Okay, that's enough.
- What?

24:41.828 --> 24:46.130
You're like grinding your boner
all over me?

24:46.132 --> 24:49.067
That's not because of you,
that's not a sex boner.

24:49.069 --> 24:52.004
That's just a night-morning
boner.

24:52.006 --> 24:54.739
Oh, thank you so much
for clarifying.

24:54.741 --> 24:56.976
MAN (OVER PHONE): <i>And, uh,
she still hasn't responded.</i>

24:56.978 --> 24:58.110
Stop, look, see, the whites
with the colors?

24:58.112 --> 24:59.644
Like it really matters.

24:59.646 --> 25:00.813
The text is out there,
it's fine.

25:00.815 --> 25:01.880
I mean, she doesn't even respond
to me...

25:01.882 --> 25:03.748
sometimes for like a day, so...

25:03.750 --> 25:05.884
MAN (OVER PHONE): <i>I'm sorry.
I'm being insane, you're right.</i>

25:05.886 --> 25:07.919
<i>Thanks, Hallie, I'll keep you
updated.</i>

25:07.921 --> 25:09.591
Bye.

25:18.098 --> 25:19.099
Argh...

25:24.971 --> 25:27.072
Are you actually still working
on that bar mitzvah video.

25:27.074 --> 25:30.109
Yeah, the guy's paying me
to reopen the edit...

25:30.111 --> 25:31.810
because his son had more notes.

25:31.812 --> 25:33.812
Kid thinks he's the next
frickin' Kuprick.

25:33.814 --> 25:35.880
Do you want to watch the
next cut with me in a little?

25:35.882 --> 25:37.082
Not really.

25:37.084 --> 25:38.283
I honestly think it was better
yesterday...

25:38.285 --> 25:41.790
but what the fuck do I know,
I'm just the editor, right?

25:49.830 --> 25:53.935
So, that's it, we're just done
talking about it?

25:55.303 --> 25:59.004
Can we just... can we just watch?

25:59.006 --> 26:01.907
Look, I don't want to watch this
for the tenth time.

26:01.909 --> 26:03.042
No, really, I have... he needs
it by tomorrow.

26:03.044 --> 26:05.009
I want to talk.

26:05.011 --> 26:08.179
So you just flat out
don't want to live with me.

26:08.181 --> 26:10.015
I mean I'm sorry, but I just
think it's a little weird...

26:10.017 --> 26:11.182
that you're not even
considering it.

26:11.184 --> 26:13.185
Of course, I've considered it,
just...

26:13.187 --> 26:14.687
Oh, thank you so much.

26:14.689 --> 26:15.920
I'm sorry you don't want
to move in...

26:15.922 --> 26:16.988
but thank you for
considering.

26:16.990 --> 26:18.189
Holy crap.

26:18.191 --> 26:20.258
You're gonna just hang onto
the one thing that I've said...

26:20.260 --> 26:22.061
because that's what people do
when they want to fight.

26:22.063 --> 26:23.195
So you just want to...

26:23.197 --> 26:25.063
I-I-I want to solve this.

26:25.065 --> 26:28.066
- Oh, you're such an asshole!
- Okay? I really do.

26:28.068 --> 26:32.971
Don't you think if we moved
in, we would never move out?

26:32.973 --> 26:36.207
Don't you want to have things to
build towards or... or things...

26:36.209 --> 26:39.044
to look forward to or maybe
there are things we're missing...

26:39.046 --> 26:42.683
out on or things that we want
to try like before we...

26:44.352 --> 26:45.985
Argh!

26:45.987 --> 26:52.256
Look, I love you, you know
I love you.

26:52.258 --> 26:57.262
Right now I'm just, I'm not
ready to settle down.

26:57.264 --> 26:58.263
- I'm just not.
- I'm not talking about...

26:58.265 --> 27:00.267
settling down, I'm talking about
living together.

27:02.803 --> 27:05.970
Look... I love you,
I love you too.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.273
I just, I... yeah, I don't
want to force it, I guess.

27:08.275 --> 27:10.141
Exactly, I don't want to force
it either.

27:10.143 --> 27:12.343
Okay, but what are you saying
when you say that?

27:12.345 --> 27:14.246
Because it sounds like you're
saying you want...

27:14.248 --> 27:16.281
to have like a break
or something.

27:16.283 --> 27:18.883
Okay, things haven't felt right.
You know that...

27:18.885 --> 27:19.985
Yeah, I know how things haven't
felt.

27:19.987 --> 27:21.219
- Things haven't felt right.
- I know!

27:21.221 --> 27:23.054
Okay, so you know!

27:23.056 --> 27:26.291
Right, so then, I don't want
to move in together.

27:26.293 --> 27:27.993
I just... I'm sorry, I don't.

27:27.995 --> 27:29.361
And what if I hadn't said
anything, huh?

27:29.363 --> 27:31.162
We'd just be laying in bed
watching your stupid...

27:31.164 --> 27:33.165
fucking bar mitzvah video
for the 20th time?

27:33.167 --> 27:35.300
We were in a fight and now
you're breaking up with me...

27:35.302 --> 27:36.935
and it's like we fight
all the time.

27:36.937 --> 27:38.937
Please don't say that.

27:38.939 --> 27:41.407
Please don't say break-up,
that's not what this is.

27:41.409 --> 27:45.143
This is just me needing time,
I just need time.

27:45.145 --> 27:47.949
Some time of not being together.

27:56.923 --> 27:58.826
Will you stay over?

then be alone.

It's actually, yeah, it's

the other day.

Which usually fucking sucks, but
it turns out we're both at nine.

and said...

other's tens."

ten people total?

just ask you a question first.

32:51.418 --> 32:55.187
Did you give the number and then
she agreed with you?

32:55.189 --> 32:58.290
Or did she give the number
first?

agreed with you.

49:41.259 --> 49:46.096
- Morning, sunshine.
- Yeah, good morning.

49:46.098 --> 49:49.632
I can't believe you grew up
in this fuck palace.

49:49.634 --> 49:52.737
Yeah.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.739
So what's the deal with your
parents?

49:54.741 --> 49:57.341
Uh, they... they do visual
effects together...

49:57.343 --> 50:01.478
and my mom's a VFX producer and
my dad's a VFX supervisor.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.513
They worked together,
that's cute.

50:03.515 --> 50:05.716
Yeah, they're like perfect.

50:05.718 --> 50:10.754
And they're doing this new
Marvel movie in Atlanta.

50:10.756 --> 50:14.093
Well, when are they back?
I really want to meet them.

50:15.227 --> 50:16.361
Sorry.

50:16.363 --> 50:18.362
Wait, have you ever introduced
them to a girl before?

50:18.364 --> 50:20.698
What, no, no...

50:20.700 --> 50:24.502
I just thought maybe it was
like a little soon, but, but no.

50:24.504 --> 50:28.239
If, if, if you want to meet
them, then I'd love that.

50:28.241 --> 50:30.507
I mean, yeah, they're
back in like a month.

50:30.509 --> 50:32.643
Oh, perfect, just in time
for the wedding.

50:32.645 --> 50:35.614
Yeah, I never introduced
them to a girlfriend before.

50:39.652 --> 50:42.620
- I'm sorry, did I just ruin it?
- No.

50:42.622 --> 50:44.288
I know, we haven't had that
conversation yet.

50:44.290 --> 50:45.790
No, no, no, it's all good.

50:45.792 --> 50:50.594
Oh, how could I forget?

50:50.596 --> 50:52.663
This is for you.

50:52.665 --> 50:55.332
A mix CD.

50:55.334 --> 50:58.469
You already gave me one.
Do you remember? Are you okay?

50:58.471 --> 51:00.471
No, this is an
extension of that one.

51:00.473 --> 51:02.406
Yeah, I made a playlist of like 40
something songs...

51:02.408 --> 51:04.741
and this everything I can fit
on the first one...

51:04.743 --> 51:07.446
because you can only do like 20
or 21 on a CD.

51:11.283 --> 51:15.252
Big Willa Style, mix number two.

51:15.254 --> 51:18.254
- This time it's personal.
- Personal, yeah.

51:18.256 --> 51:20.326
Whoa.

51:23.696 --> 51:27.397

some breakfast?

51:27.399 --> 51:29.667
Um, I'm actually not hungry.

51:29.669 --> 51:30.734
Oh, okay.

51:30.736 --> 51:33.471
Well, I mean we could do like
a... do a bagel run...

51:33.473 --> 51:37.308
we could get like a dozen or
something bagels.

51:37.310 --> 51:38.576
That's a lot of bagels.

51:38.578 --> 51:40.844
Oh shit. I just remembered
my laundry.

51:40.846 --> 51:44.214
Oh, word, we can... we can go
grab it.

51:44.216 --> 51:46.216
No, it'll get moldy and wrinkly.

51:46.218 --> 51:48.219

I'm fucking starving.

54:10.763 --> 54:12.663

54:12.665 --> 54:17.701
Willa, what are you doing?
Are you texting Jacob?

54:17.703 --> 54:19.703
I thought you said
you were done with him.

54:19.705 --> 54:21.705

Forget about Jakob, okay?
He's a dick.

54:24.710 --> 54:26.777
- He spells his name like Jacob.
- That is true.

54:26.779 --> 54:27.844
Just make it work with Matt.

54:27.846 --> 54:31.582
I mean, I know he's weird,
but he's a good guy...

54:31.584 --> 54:33.750
and you're being stupid, okay.

54:33.752 --> 54:36.420
I mean, you have someone that
wants to spend time with you.

54:36.422 --> 54:40.424
Okay, I am... I'm alone, like I am...
I'm so fucking alone...

54:40.426 --> 54:42.893
to be honest, I just cannot hear
you go on and on and on...

Matt texted me too much.

54:45.665 --> 54:47.665
Matt just wants to
eat bagels with me.

54:47.667 --> 54:49.900

- No?

55:46.658 --> 55:47.824
- You remember it.
- I remember.

55:47.826 --> 55:49.092
Because if you forget it,
it does kind of make the magic.

55:49.094 --> 55:50.694
- Okay.
- All right.

55:50.696 --> 55:52.962
- Do you want me to shuffle?
- Mm-hm.

55:52.964 --> 55:54.897
Yeah? Wow, you are very
suspicious.

55:54.899 --> 55:55.998

trusting of me.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.536
I don't see... okay, here we go.

55:59.538 --> 56:02.906
I'm going to try and find
your card out of all these.

56:02.908 --> 56:05.708
But I'm going to try to
find it using my mouth.

56:05.710 --> 56:08.448
Okay, and double check,
there's nothing in my mouth?

56:11.616 --> 56:13.650
- Okay.
- We good? Okay, here we go.

56:13.652 --> 56:14.917
Well, there is, there's teeth
and the tongue...

then you'll miss anything.

56:21.060 --> 56:22.529

- No, it's not my card.
- What?

56:35.707 --> 56:37.876
- It's not my card.
- Oh, my god, what?

56:40.145 --> 56:41.547
Fuck.

- What the fuck?
- Wait, my eyes are watering.

57:02.535 --> 57:07.737
- Was that it?
- What the... how did you do that?

57:07.739 --> 57:09.038
You're such a nerd.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.875

as a compliment.

- Just untie it.

Did you go to the beach today?

58:40.966 --> 58:42.165
No.

58:42.167 --> 58:44.902
Then why are you wearing
a bathing suit?

58:44.904 --> 58:47.170
Because I didn't have any clean
bras.

58:47.172 --> 58:51.007
I thought you just did your
laundry.

58:51.009 --> 58:54.714
Isn't that why you left the
other day, to get your laundry?

59:06.759 --> 59:09.225
Why don't you just tell me
stuff?

59:09.227 --> 59:11.161
Sorry.

59:11.163 --> 59:13.297

hang out or whatever.

I come back, Hallie's waiting
for me...

wearing my favorite dress
and I'm like, hello.

01:04:58.442 --> 01:05:00.243
We started making out.

01:05:00.245 --> 01:05:02.112
We come in here and I eat
her pussy...

01:05:02.114 --> 01:05:04.346
- exactly where you're sitting.
- Oh lovely, thank you.

01:05:04.348 --> 01:05:06.348
And that was it, that was the
entire interaction.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:09.085
Because I'm serious and busy.

01:05:09.087 --> 01:05:11.991
- You mind giving me another pour?
- Sure, bro.

01:05:14.426 --> 01:05:15.558
Nope, you failed the test.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.462
The serious and busy test,
you failed it. Failed it.

01:05:19.464 --> 01:05:22.498
I literally put it right here so
I have access to it...

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.236
so I could just reach and pour.

01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:30.239
- Would you like some?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:32.141
- I'm busy.
- Good.

01:05:32.143 --> 01:05:34.312
That was test number two.
That one you passed.

- Hey.

So should we just go to the show
or...

01:06:26.598 --> 01:06:30.600
I don't know, I thought we could
hang out for a sec.

01:06:30.602 --> 01:06:33.703
You know, I think DJ Diaz goes
on at 9:00, so...

01:06:33.705 --> 01:06:36.605
Oh yeah, don't want to be
late for the show.

01:06:36.607 --> 01:06:37.741
All right.

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.341
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot, I'm
sure they'll start late.

01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:42.212
Oh, you're serious.

01:06:42.214 --> 01:06:44.382

trying to fuck you.

of seeing someone.

was of interest to you.

over and I went down on you?

Yeah, the girl, yeah.

01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:11.654
I can't believe you're dating
a girl...

this is insane.

Mom, you're fucking killing me!

Anyways, I've been doing a lot
of thinking...

01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:27.436
and at first, I was so fucking
mad at you, I was.

01:10:27.438 --> 01:10:29.504
I was thinking like, how did I
waste the first half of my...

01:10:29.506 --> 01:10:33.575
twenties with this guy who I'm
not going to marry?

01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:34.843
Right.

01:10:34.845 --> 01:10:37.847

that these, these last five...

- years have been the opposite...
- Three.

It's been three years.

hurt each other, it's...
it's fine.

become the people...

I fucked up.

01:10:57.469 --> 01:10:59.602
Okay, I shouldn't have said that
I wanted a break.

01:10:59.604 --> 01:11:01.637
I was naive enough to think that
it could be a break...

01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:03.373
- and not a break up.

Why would you tell your mom
that?

It's fine. I also just want to
say this non sequitur...

01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:42.512
but I, I did slightly
resent the fact...

01:11:42.514 --> 01:11:43.612
that you neglected to tell me...

have been a picture...

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.560
Maybe we should...

01:11:57.461 --> 01:12:00.530
Maybe the problem is that we
kept in touch...

01:12:00.532 --> 01:12:05.034
and that we slept together or
that we're obviously going...

01:12:05.036 --> 01:12:06.668
at completely different
speeds...

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:11.540
so maybe let's just not talk
for a while.

01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:13.575
Okay. You know, I just want
to point out...

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:15.977
that I never put any
pressure on you.

01:12:15.979 --> 01:12:20.482
I mean, yes, I wanted to move in
together out of practicality.

01:12:20.484 --> 01:12:23.485

01:12:42.741 --> 01:12:45.508
What are you talking about?

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:48.811
I know I shouldn't have, but...

01:12:48.813 --> 01:12:50.812
I looked on your phone
a while back.

01:12:50.814 --> 01:12:52.615
Wait, you hacked into my
phone?

01:12:52.617 --> 01:12:54.851
It was a moment of weakness,
I'm sorry.

01:12:54.853 --> 01:12:57.619
It was so long ago, things
with Jakob.

01:12:57.621 --> 01:12:58.620
It was like May.

01:12:58.622 --> 01:13:01.790
Also it didn't even mean
anything, so who cares?

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:02.892
Whatever's been happening
between us...

01:13:02.894 --> 01:13:06.495
whatever it's called, it's a big
deal to me, all right.

01:13:06.497 --> 01:13:09.499
Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe. Maybe it
shouldn't be, but it is.

01:13:09.501 --> 01:13:10.932
It's a big deal to me.

01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:13.602
Yeah, and it's a big deal
to me, too.

01:13:13.604 --> 01:13:16.672
I don't think it is,
but that's fine.

01:13:16.674 --> 01:13:17.906
Obviously you find yourself
in these situations...

01:13:17.908 --> 01:13:21.846
more often than I do and you're
a lot better at it than I am.

01:13:25.617 --> 01:13:27.048
I had a thing with this girl
a while back.

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:30.887
She went abroad, and... the whole
time I thought that maybe...

01:13:30.889 --> 01:13:37.959
I'd have another shot when she
came back, but then I found...

01:13:37.961 --> 01:13:41.998
out she dated like four other
guys that year.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.102
To me, she was the one that got
away, but to her I was a blip.

01:13:46.104 --> 01:13:47.506
I was just some guy she fucked.

01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:54.512
And I'm not mad at you, you
don't owe me anything, but...

01:13:57.614 --> 01:14:00.685
I don't know, I just think maybe
we shouldn't do this anymore.

01:14:02.854 --> 01:14:04.923
Wait, what?

01:14:08.926 --> 01:14:10.728
No, what are you saying?

01:14:16.067 --> 01:14:18.770
Can I still sleep over?

01:14:33.585 --> 01:14:35.985
I feel like you're a whole
section of my story...

01:14:35.987 --> 01:14:38.690
and I'm like a footnote
in yours.

01:14:41.091 --> 01:14:43.828
I promise you're not a footnote.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:48.000
I promise you're at least
a chapter.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.734
I'm so happy that you were
the one to break it off...

01:15:24.736 --> 01:15:26.168
with Willa and not the other
way around.

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:28.003
I thought she could've fucking
prison shanked you...

01:15:28.005 --> 01:15:29.739
and you would have stayed
with her?

01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:32.173
Honestly, I wish we were better
at communicating, you know.

01:15:32.175 --> 01:15:34.910
It's like you can never be
inside someone else's head...

01:15:34.912 --> 01:15:38.213
and I guess you wouldn't
want to be.

01:15:38.215 --> 01:15:40.950
Not unless you're a
fucking Taro card reader.

01:15:40.952 --> 01:15:43.188
I mean, she's got to communicate
with you, too, you know?

01:15:45.156 --> 01:15:47.722
Here's what it is. She's like,
she's like a cat...

01:15:47.724 --> 01:15:50.759
who keeps asking you to pet it
and then you do...

01:15:50.761 --> 01:15:52.261
and she just slips out of your
hands and runs away.

01:15:52.263 --> 01:15:54.763
I think you need to work on your
analogies, sweetheart.

01:15:54.765 --> 01:15:56.899
- Oops... shit!
- Go under.

01:15:56.901 --> 01:15:58.901
No, no, no, no, don't
go any further.

01:15:58.903 --> 01:16:01.303
Easy. Cheers.

01:16:01.305 --> 01:16:03.772
I get it, Matt's too nice
for you.

01:16:03.774 --> 01:16:06.142
I mean, it's not the cliche of
"I like assholes".

01:16:06.144 --> 01:16:08.043
I like nice guys.

01:16:08.045 --> 01:16:11.746
It's just that the nice guys
turn out to be pretty needy...

01:16:11.748 --> 01:16:13.915
and then you realize, oh, he's
being a pussy.

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:17.887
I think I'm just being
an asshole.

01:16:17.889 --> 01:16:19.722
You lost me.

01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:21.990
When would we get a chance to do
this if you were with Hallie...

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:23.125
and I was with Willa?

01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:25.727
Yeah, I'm glad we broke up with
our fucking beautiful...

01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:28.030
significant others so we can
hang out with each other...

01:16:28.032 --> 01:16:31.167
and strap Tecates to our hands.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.069
I'm having the time of my life!

01:16:33.071 --> 01:16:34.337
That's what's sad...

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:37.707
you really are having the time
of your life.

01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:40.176
Honestly, I can't believe
Hallie's dating a girl.

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:41.944
I don't know, I think they were
just hooking up.

01:16:41.946 --> 01:16:43.178
- What, really?
- Yeah.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.713
She just told me they were
dating.

01:16:44.715 --> 01:16:46.082
Like she just... when I just saw
her...

01:16:46.084 --> 01:16:48.351
she was like, "we're dating.
You should know."

01:16:48.353 --> 01:16:51.052
And she was like, well, I'm
dating her.

01:16:51.054 --> 01:16:54.723
Is she trying to fuck with me,
what is she doing?

01:16:54.725 --> 01:16:56.694
To be fair, you, you,
you broke up with her.

01:16:59.863 --> 01:17:03.332
You're right.

01:17:03.334 --> 01:17:06.201
Jesus, am I the needy one
in the Jakob situation?

01:17:06.203 --> 01:17:07.469
Am I his Matt?

01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:13.174
Enough Jakob, you only like him
because he didn't text you back.

01:17:13.176 --> 01:17:19.315
I mean technically I moved
out here to go to grad school.

01:17:19.317 --> 01:17:21.350
Obviously in the back of my
mind, part of it...

01:17:21.352 --> 01:17:23.753
was that Jakob would be
out here.

01:17:23.755 --> 01:17:25.253
Hm.

01:17:25.255 --> 01:17:26.321
Am I felicity?

01:17:26.323 --> 01:17:30.793
Willa, we're all felicity.

01:17:30.795 --> 01:17:32.395
Look, fuck Jakob, okay?

01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:35.998
I've said it before,
but Jakob's a dick...

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.103
and that is my philosophy.

01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:43.873
Your philosophy is that Jakob's
a dick.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:46.342
No, my philosophy is that if
someone is not being nice...

01:17:46.344 --> 01:17:50.111
to you, then you fucking
drop them.

01:17:50.113 --> 01:17:53.949
I don't want to get back
together and then just spend...

01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:58.020
the rest of the time resenting
each other all over again.

01:17:58.022 --> 01:18:00.056
You know?

01:18:00.058 --> 01:18:02.825
I don't think you ever
find someone...

01:18:02.827 --> 01:18:05.860
you don't resent
and that's part of it.

01:18:05.862 --> 01:18:11.869
Just find the person who
you want to resent, you know.

01:18:27.818 --> 01:18:29.051
Hey, Matt.

01:18:29.053 --> 01:18:31.454
I don't know, I think you're
overthinking it. It's easy...

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:34.155
to forget how hard it can be
just to connect with someone.

01:18:34.157 --> 01:18:35.124
Yeah.

01:18:35.126 --> 01:18:37.058
It's like when you pass a
parking space...

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.293
because you want one close to
the restaurant...

01:18:38.295 --> 01:18:40.929
and then you circle the block
and you come back and it's gone.

01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:42.063
Okay.

01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:43.332
Honestly, really in a
lifetime...

01:18:43.334 --> 01:18:47.936
how many people do you truly
connect with?

01:18:47.938 --> 01:18:50.905
Matt, Owen is not a parking
space.

01:18:50.907 --> 01:18:56.180
Just, can you go talk to him,
please?

I'll be right there.

01:20:58.269 --> 01:21:00.535
You, uh, you, you
want something to drink?

01:21:00.537 --> 01:21:04.073
Uh, like what? Like tap
water or something?

01:21:04.075 --> 01:21:05.406
Well, actually went shopping...

01:21:05.408 --> 01:21:08.343
and I have um, San Pellegrino?

01:21:08.345 --> 01:21:10.445
San Pellegrino?

a gondolier now?

01:21:19.023 --> 01:21:20.358
Please.

Can I actually have a sip?
I forgot, that's my last one.

01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:48.987
That's good.

01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:58.127
So I, I'm just basically, I just
wanted to say again...

01:21:58.129 --> 01:22:03.298
that I'm, I'm sorry for being so
selfish and um...

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.235
I feel like everybody creates
their own narrative...

01:22:07.237 --> 01:22:10.539
in their head and for whatever
reason I felt like I was...

01:22:10.541 --> 01:22:12.441
somebody who needed to explore
things...

01:22:12.443 --> 01:22:16.277
and the more lonely I got, the
more I realized that...

01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:18.681
was something I didn't actually
feel but convinced myself...

01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:22.551
that I needed to feel it, and
maybe that's the same thing.

01:22:22.553 --> 01:22:24.552
I don't even know the
difference anymore.

01:22:24.554 --> 01:22:28.356
Owen, I didn't come here
for some big apology.

01:22:28.358 --> 01:22:31.161
I just came here to talk.

01:22:39.703 --> 01:22:41.572
Will you move in with me?

01:22:42.706 --> 01:22:44.440
Sorry, what?

01:22:44.442 --> 01:22:47.642
Move in with you where, here?

01:22:47.644 --> 01:22:50.178
Why don't we, for once, let the
fact that something...

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.679
is a bad idea, stop us from
doing it.

01:22:51.681 --> 01:22:54.383
No, it doesn't have to be here.
It could be anywhere.

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:55.718
We can get our
own place together.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.419
- You're kidding.
- It's just transitional.

01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:02.591
Look, look, I know, I know I
ruined everything, I know that.

01:23:02.593 --> 01:23:07.161
I know I'm an asshole, I know
that I'm an idiot.

01:23:07.163 --> 01:23:10.164
I'm really, really ready now.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:14.102
I'm truly like I'm ready,
I promise.

01:23:14.104 --> 01:23:16.437
I thought you said this place
is just transitional.

01:23:16.439 --> 01:23:18.606
Look, I, I cleaned out
half my closet for you.

01:23:18.608 --> 01:23:23.111
You moved your four shirts
like over on a fucking rail.

01:23:23.113 --> 01:23:25.280
Well, for some people,
that's significant.

01:23:25.282 --> 01:23:27.716
I cleaned the bathroom, I bought
flowers and I put them...

01:23:27.718 --> 01:23:31.488
in this vase and I swiffered the
fucking floor for you and...

01:23:36.527 --> 01:23:38.727
I've never made a copy of a key
in my entire life...

01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:43.164
and I made a copy of a key
for you. So please, Hallie...

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:46.470
please, will you move in
with me?

ever go back.

You're seriously not gonna say
anything about the new couch?

Yeah, it was the first
thing I noticed.

I know it was the first thing
you noticed and you...

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.561
didn't fucking say anything,
you're so annoying.

You're so fucking annoying.

01:25:22.265 --> 01:25:25.700

this is not a couch.

- It's a day bed, it's a fucking...
- It's a day bed.

something you sit on?

Doesn't that make it a couch?
