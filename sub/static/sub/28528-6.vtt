<i>"Dearest Mother,
the weeks have passed</i>

01:20.728 --> 01:23.849
<i>and still I have heard
nothing from you.</i>

01:23.851 --> 01:26.612
<i>King Henry waits upon
a dispensation from the pope</i>

01:26.614 --> 01:30.258
<i>and my dowry before my marriage
to Prince Harry can be sealed.</i>

01:31.700 --> 01:33.139
<i>The marriage will accomplish</i>

01:33.141 --> 01:35.181
<i>everything
you sent me here to do,</i>

01:35.183 --> 01:37.546
<i>but more than that,
we are happy.</i>

01:39.387 --> 01:41.307
<i>Mother, please,
I beg you now</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:43.470
<i>to settle this debt
with the king.</i>

01:43.472 --> 01:46.753
<i>Harry is devoted to me.</i>

01:46.755 --> 01:49.516
<i>He is devout.</i>

01:49.518 --> 01:53.202
<i>His knowledge of the Catholic
saints outrivals even yours.</i>

01:54.763 --> 01:59.606
<i>We share a dream
of how we would rule England</i>

01:59.608 --> 02:02.209
<i>as a land of chivalry,</i>

02:02.211 --> 02:04.934
<i>basking
in the holy light of God.</i>

02:11.621 --> 02:13.941
<i>Queen of England
is my destiny,</i>

02:13.943 --> 02:16.385
<i>as you have told me
since I was a girl.</i>

02:23.232 --> 02:25.995
<i>Your devoted daughter,
Catherine."</i>

02:36.126 --> 02:39.007
I am certain my mother will
respond as I have asked.

02:39.009 --> 02:41.449
I don't care
if she does or not.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.171
We are to wed.

02:43.173 --> 02:45.213
I don't care
what my father thinks

02:45.215 --> 02:48.458
or Wolsey
or my grandmother.

02:50.541 --> 02:52.220
If we were wed,

02:52.222 --> 02:55.664
maybe I could help
poor Margaret Pole.

02:55.666 --> 02:57.626
I've written to her,

02:57.628 --> 03:00.469
offering whatever help
I can give.

03:00.471 --> 03:04.032
Who will take care of her
now she's lost her husband?

03:04.034 --> 03:07.878
She will be forced to live
on charity from relations.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.080
You have such compassion.

03:12.643 --> 03:16.247
It's one of the many things
that I love about you.

03:31.262 --> 03:34.185
You're mine, Catherine.

03:35.987 --> 03:39.110
And no one
will stand in our way.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.765
Henry!

03:54.767 --> 03:57.327
<i>Henry, they're here,</i>

03:57.329 --> 03:59.411
the Spanish, in England.

04:01.053 --> 04:02.653
God smiles on us.

04:02.655 --> 04:04.657
He sent them to us.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.859
Come.

04:08.861 --> 04:10.461
Oh.

04:10.463 --> 04:13.304
Does the baby
give you pain?

04:13.306 --> 04:17.069
Why does Stafford take so long
to tell me of his plan for me?

04:26.559 --> 04:29.042
A letter.
Lady Margaret.

04:30.323 --> 04:32.884
I am to be lambasted,
I suppose?

04:32.886 --> 04:35.366
What wrong have I dealt
the Tudors this time?

04:35.368 --> 04:39.611
The queen of Castile
is in England,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.933
on her way
to Westminster.

04:41.935 --> 04:44.215
My mother? She is here?

04:44.217 --> 04:47.461
<i>Oh, Lina,
I have missed her.</i>

04:49.263 --> 04:51.265
What?

04:55.429 --> 04:59.273
It is your sister
who is here...

05:00.955 --> 05:02.957
<i>Joanna.</i>

05:04.919 --> 05:08.522
<i>Your mother
passed away...</i>

05:11.245 --> 05:13.247
<i>and Joanna
is now queen.</i>

05:17.091 --> 05:21.215
Lady Margaret and King Henry
offer their condolences...

05:22.777 --> 05:24.216
and invite you
to the court

05:24.218 --> 05:26.178
while your sister
is in London.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.860
<i>No.</i>

05:27.862 --> 05:29.342
<i>No.</i>

05:29.344 --> 05:32.105
No. I...

05:36.711 --> 05:39.632
<i>Isabella of Castile is dead.</i>

05:39.634 --> 05:41.995
The new Spanish queen

05:41.997 --> 05:45.198
has been blown off course
in stormy seas,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.762
sailing from the Habsburg Empire
to claim her kingdom.

05:48.764 --> 05:52.608
God has seen fit
to bring her to these shores.

05:54.129 --> 05:56.930
I fail to see
the fortune in this.

05:56.932 --> 05:59.052
<i>Queen Joanna's
husband Philip</i>

05:59.054 --> 06:02.338
is son to the Holy Roman
Emperor Maximilian...

06:03.779 --> 06:06.340
who harbors
our most wanted traitor,

06:06.342 --> 06:07.901
Edmund de la Pool.

06:07.903 --> 06:09.583
We have invited them
to court

06:09.585 --> 06:13.587
while their ship is towed
to Tilbury docks for repair,

06:13.589 --> 06:16.750
but it will only take
a day or two.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.994
<i>We must impress upon this
Philip the many benefits</i>

06:19.996 --> 06:21.555
should he
persuade the emperor

06:21.557 --> 06:24.078
to turn his York
friend over to us.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.401
I thought Maximilian had
sworn he would not do that.

06:27.403 --> 06:29.405
Then we
must be persuasive.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.119
Your Majesties,

07:43.121 --> 07:47.686
Queen Joanna of Castile
and King Consort Philip.

07:51.690 --> 07:55.212
We share your sadness
on the death of Queen Isabella.

07:55.214 --> 07:57.774
Please,
leave your weapons here.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.139
<i>You are our guests.</i>

08:16.916 --> 08:18.716
<i>Oh, Your Highness.</i>

08:18.718 --> 08:20.277
See how brave I am?

08:20.279 --> 08:22.281
Princess Catherine...

08:24.163 --> 08:25.683
my condolences.

08:25.685 --> 08:29.687
You were a child
when I last saw you.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.691
Joanna.

08:32.491 --> 08:35.573
Do you know
how she passed?

08:35.575 --> 08:38.456
She died of grief
for our brother John.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.859
That's what they said,

08:40.861 --> 08:45.423
seven years of grieving
for her favorite child.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.427
Sister.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.948
May we not embrace?

08:49.950 --> 08:53.632
Your husband died, and Mother
wouldn't bring you back to Spain

08:53.634 --> 08:57.315
until the king here paid
your widow's jointure.

08:57.317 --> 09:01.039
Always land and gold
before her daughters,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.001
always her alliances...

09:05.005 --> 09:07.007
...always God.

09:09.570 --> 09:13.532
After our repast,
tonight's mass for All Hallows

09:13.534 --> 09:16.175
will be dedicated
to your mother.

09:16.177 --> 09:19.658
You will have
to drain your treasury

09:19.660 --> 09:22.902
to fund the mass our mother
needs to save her soul.

09:22.904 --> 09:24.904
All the gold in Spain
wouldn't be enough.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.305
That's a wicked thing
to say.

09:26.307 --> 09:29.949
Oh, yes, that's right.
You loved her.

09:29.951 --> 09:33.915
Well, I didn't,
because I knew her for the whore she was.

09:35.477 --> 09:37.677
We don't need your mass.

09:37.679 --> 09:40.079
Pray instead our ship's
mended by the morning

09:40.081 --> 09:43.485
so I can sail
to Castile and my crown.

09:46.528 --> 09:49.051
We will have
a mass for her.

10:06.629 --> 10:09.830
Oh,
so beautiful a girl.

10:09.832 --> 10:11.071
Don't tell me.

10:11.073 --> 10:13.474
Princess Mary? No?

10:13.476 --> 10:16.557
And you must
her charming nursemaid.

10:16.559 --> 10:19.320
Your Highness,
I hope you and the queen

10:19.322 --> 10:22.203
won't find our meal
too humble for your tastes.

10:23.806 --> 10:25.406
The queen is
on her way, I hope?

10:25.408 --> 10:28.369
My father, he says
to me that your piety

10:28.371 --> 10:30.371
<i>est célèbre</i> in all
of Christendom...

10:30.373 --> 10:31.973
Well, that's very...

10:31.975 --> 10:35.817
while my wife
doubts God altogether.

10:35.819 --> 10:37.138
Her mother's passing,

10:37.140 --> 10:38.980
I suppose that would
shake her faith...

10:38.982 --> 10:41.983
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, she does not believe at all.

10:41.985 --> 10:45.587
She says he is <i>une fantaisie</i>
we make in our own mind.

10:45.589 --> 10:46.708
Oh, no, surely she...

10:46.710 --> 10:48.189
But I keep faith,

10:48.191 --> 10:51.154
for Spain and for
the Habsburg Empire.

10:52.636 --> 10:53.955
Your Highness.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.959
Sit beside me.

10:59.563 --> 11:01.563
Whilst you
are in our court,

11:01.565 --> 11:04.526
I hope
we can speak about ways

11:04.528 --> 11:07.249
to seal the bond
between our two nations.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.212
<i>Mais oui,</i>
but first, we eat, no?

11:10.214 --> 11:12.216
Of course.

11:12.817 --> 11:17.179
Your Grace, I must say
that this feast...

11:17.181 --> 11:19.462
One moment, Charlie.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.512
Catherine, I...

11:35.320 --> 11:38.681
I know you loved her
very, very much.

11:38.683 --> 11:40.685
Yes.

11:41.486 --> 11:44.209
But it seems
my sister didn't.

11:47.813 --> 11:50.453
Now she is queen,
my father says we cannot marry.

11:50.455 --> 11:52.095
He has written
to the pope.

11:52.097 --> 11:54.538
He says your father
will not pay the dowry

11:54.540 --> 11:56.740
now that your mother
is with God.

11:56.742 --> 11:59.503
And my grandmother
adds that your rank

11:59.505 --> 12:04.588
has dropped too low to be
wife to the king of England.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.351
But they are bloodless,

12:07.353 --> 12:08.632
all of them.

12:08.634 --> 12:11.595
What passion
have they known?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.557
Harry.

12:13.559 --> 12:15.559
You must meet
the Spanish royals.

12:15.561 --> 12:18.402
I thought I was
addressing one already

12:18.404 --> 12:21.165
and offering her comfort
in her grief...

12:21.167 --> 12:23.407
You will be
the king of England,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.329
and whether it may
please you or it doesn't,

12:25.331 --> 12:29.213
you must make pleasantries
with our royal guests.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.496
I will meet them...

12:31.498 --> 12:33.660
because they will
be family to me.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.830
Lady Catherine.

12:45.872 --> 12:47.874
...as it is.

12:49.316 --> 12:50.355
What is wrong?

12:50.357 --> 12:52.359
Uh, nothing.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.486
Highness?

13:01.488 --> 13:03.490
Lady Pole was right.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.092
This is a game
that must be played.

13:07.094 --> 13:11.098
If my father will not pay the
dowry, then my sister must.

13:23.191 --> 13:26.034
Aelwyd, I'm sorry,
but I must have the rent.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.559
Wait for me.

13:39.407 --> 13:41.570
The harvest's been bad.
We're short.

13:45.253 --> 13:47.255
Buy your children
something sweet...

13:48.897 --> 13:49.896
a treat.

13:49.898 --> 13:51.900
Thank you.

14:14.844 --> 14:17.645
You have not paid
your taxes to the Crown.

14:17.647 --> 14:20.247
Wh-what taxes?

14:20.249 --> 14:22.049
Upon your husband's death,

14:22.051 --> 14:24.772
your sons were made
wards of the king.

14:24.774 --> 14:27.575
A 2/3 portion
of your rents and produce

14:27.577 --> 14:29.297
must be paid over
each month.

14:29.299 --> 14:30.458
But...

14:30.460 --> 14:31.979
You are
three months in arrears,

14:31.981 --> 14:34.662
plus a fine
for your late payment.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.384
Show me your rent ledgers.

14:36.386 --> 14:39.107
Uh, but I received
no letter.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.349
Please, my tenants
cannot even pay their rents.

14:41.351 --> 14:42.791
There's nothing
to spare.

14:42.793 --> 14:45.673
Then you shall make up
the shortfall. Come on!

14:45.675 --> 14:47.756
Please,
I need more time.

14:47.758 --> 14:49.397
You are already late.

14:49.399 --> 14:52.523
If you cannot pay, then we'll
take your goods in kind.

14:56.366 --> 14:58.246
- Mother?
- Mother!

14:58.248 --> 15:00.250
<i>What's happening?</i>

15:18.669 --> 15:20.870
<i>Well,
the circumstances are unfortunate,</i>

15:20.872 --> 15:25.394
but we are glad to offer
you our hospitality.

15:25.396 --> 15:28.437
In any case, your grief
and your trying journey

15:28.439 --> 15:31.841
have not dulled
your beauty.

15:31.843 --> 15:34.163
When we have supped,
we will confer

15:34.165 --> 15:36.486
on trade and matters
of the state.

15:36.488 --> 15:40.770
Joanna, tell me
of your children.

15:40.772 --> 15:42.452
Your new baby is a boy.

15:42.454 --> 15:44.134
The baby
stayed behind at home

15:44.136 --> 15:46.936
with our children
and a nursemaid.

15:46.938 --> 15:49.619
Cathy, let us dance.

15:49.621 --> 15:52.422
We used to dance
when we were children.

15:52.424 --> 15:54.184
Your hands were tiny.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.346
Your mother
has just died.

15:56.348 --> 15:59.109
Then we will dance to celebrate
her life and triumphs.

15:59.111 --> 16:01.111
Oh, yes, I would love
to see you dance.

16:01.113 --> 16:02.713
<i>Música española!</i>

16:02.715 --> 16:04.194
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

16:04.196 --> 16:05.435
<i>Español.</i>

16:05.437 --> 16:08.078
Someone get my father
out of here

16:08.080 --> 16:10.361
before we all throw
our guts up on the table.

16:10.363 --> 16:11.362
<i>Harry!</i>

16:11.364 --> 16:12.523
The Spanish queen

16:12.525 --> 16:15.005
is someone else's
wife, Father.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.728
You must learn
to find your own.

16:17.730 --> 16:19.772
So you would shame
your own king, would you now?

16:52.246 --> 16:55.847
I tried to raise the question
of Edmund de la Pool.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.649
- Mm-hmm.
- But Philip either dodges it

16:57.651 --> 16:59.891
or else becomes
unfathomably French.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.053
Hmm.

17:01.055 --> 17:03.057
- Henry.
- Hmm?

17:09.904 --> 17:13.105
Try to keep your mind on
the opportunity before us.

17:13.107 --> 17:15.267
- I...
- In case you'd forgotten,

17:15.269 --> 17:17.829
it is not dancing.

17:20.394 --> 17:23.596
With the Spanish women,
that's how we dance together.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.196
Oh, goodness me.

17:25.199 --> 17:26.999
Oh, wait.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.764
...Princess Mary!

17:31.766 --> 17:33.768
<i>Jolie.</i>

17:34.769 --> 17:37.090
Joanna.

17:37.092 --> 17:39.094
<i>Joanna!</i>

17:40.375 --> 17:43.338
Good Christians,
let us go to mass.

18:10.566 --> 18:12.846
<i>"Your Grace,
I cannot pay the taxes</i>

18:12.848 --> 18:14.850
<i>that the Crown requires of me.</i>

18:16.092 --> 18:18.532
<i>Your clerks have taken
everything of value that I own,</i>

18:18.534 --> 18:21.776
<i>and still there is debt to pay.</i>

18:21.778 --> 18:23.577
<i>I throw myself upon your mercy,</i>

18:23.579 --> 18:25.339
<i>as my children will be hungry</i>

18:25.341 --> 18:26.861
<i>if this debt
cannot be waived.</i>

18:26.863 --> 18:29.864
<i>I am ever loyal,
as I was to Lizzie.</i>

18:29.866 --> 18:32.146
<i>And I grieve her passing
every day.</i>

18:32.148 --> 18:35.269
<i>Please, Your Grace, have pity.</i>

18:35.271 --> 18:38.192
<i>There's no one else to help us.</i>

18:38.194 --> 18:41.796
<i>Your loyal servant,
Margaret Pole."</i>

19:22.280 --> 19:24.282
Yes.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.162
You said that...

19:27.365 --> 19:29.367
I know.

19:30.969 --> 19:35.171
Then I am saying yes.
Please?

19:35.173 --> 19:39.858
Uh, to...to our wedding.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.022
So you don't think
about my wages now?

19:46.024 --> 19:50.909
I...The Infanta gave me
three gold plates,

19:52.030 --> 19:54.032
a dowry.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.795
You may
give them back to her.

19:58.637 --> 20:03.482
We marry when your husband
can support you.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.090
What are you doing
in here alone?

20:18.337 --> 20:20.339
Kissing you.

20:47.207 --> 20:49.209
You didn't come
to mass.

20:51.011 --> 20:54.252
I hoped to find
some comfort with you.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.015
There is nobody
to pray to,

20:57.017 --> 20:59.219
or else
He isn't listening.

21:00.621 --> 21:02.623
Joanna...

21:03.143 --> 21:05.063
I know we haven't
seen each other for many...

21:05.065 --> 21:07.906
Tell me, did you
love your husband?

21:07.908 --> 21:09.910
Arthur?

21:13.274 --> 21:15.276
I tried to.

21:16.397 --> 21:19.198
I feel ashamed, but...

21:19.200 --> 21:22.523
I think I don't
remember anymore.

21:24.445 --> 21:28.850
I loved his kindness,
what he could have been.

21:31.092 --> 21:32.732
Joanna, there is
something I want to ask...

21:32.734 --> 21:37.497
In Flanders,
at his father's court,

21:37.499 --> 21:40.540
Philip took his seventh
lover of our marriage,

21:40.542 --> 21:43.743
<i>closest lady
of my chamber.</i>

21:43.745 --> 21:45.865
He said I imagined it,

21:45.867 --> 21:49.309
so I cut off all her hair.

21:49.311 --> 21:50.710
<i>He raged.</i>

21:50.712 --> 21:52.874
He wouldn't speak to me...

21:54.316 --> 21:58.999
so I had my ladies put
love potions in his wine,

21:59.001 --> 22:03.043
because my heart
is in a noose.

22:03.045 --> 22:04.805
<i>But he caught them.</i>

22:04.807 --> 22:09.171
He dismissed them,
and he locked me in my room.

22:10.653 --> 22:12.653
Now he's writing
to our father,

22:12.655 --> 22:15.215
saying he will rule
instead of me.

22:15.217 --> 22:18.859
He means to have coins minted
with his own face next to mine,

22:18.861 --> 22:21.182
to try to be
the king himself,

22:21.184 --> 22:23.824
and now our father
does the same

22:23.826 --> 22:26.107
and also tries
to steal my kingdom.

22:26.109 --> 22:27.468
But you are the queen.

22:29.192 --> 22:32.113
Our mother's crown
passed on to you.

22:32.115 --> 22:34.075
They have no right.

22:34.077 --> 22:38.081
All they see is power that
they want and they will take.

22:39.522 --> 22:42.886
I'm just a chicken bone
they squabble over...

22:44.848 --> 22:48.610
not a wife.

22:48.612 --> 22:50.614
Not a daughter.

22:51.014 --> 22:53.375
Never marry, Catherine.

22:53.377 --> 22:56.180
Men are pigs,
and marriage is a trap.

22:57.421 --> 22:59.781
You're lucky you're free.

23:01.986 --> 23:03.988
Joanna!

23:04.788 --> 23:07.629
Your sister is...

23:07.631 --> 23:09.271
I cannot even see a woman

23:09.273 --> 23:11.353
before she's so certain
I'm making love with her.

23:11.355 --> 23:13.435
You see what I
must live with?

23:13.437 --> 23:16.278
I see my sister
is unhappy,

23:16.280 --> 23:18.881
and I also see
the cause of it.

23:23.207 --> 23:25.127
...Catherine,

23:25.129 --> 23:27.251
wife of no one.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.856
<i>All she has is words,</i>

23:33.858 --> 23:35.898
nobody
to listen to them.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.902
We will leave
in the morning.

23:41.786 --> 23:42.866
Lina.

23:48.273 --> 23:50.954
It is freezing cold
and damp.

23:53.839 --> 23:57.481
Here. Keep him warm...

23:57.483 --> 23:59.603
or her.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.965
I can sleep without.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.231
I had my chance
to ask her for the dowry,

24:27.233 --> 24:29.235
but I didn't grasp it.

24:30.717 --> 24:32.719
She is too tormented.

24:35.201 --> 24:37.444
I do not see
my future anymore...

24:39.326 --> 24:41.608
how I can ever be
a wife to Harry.

24:54.181 --> 24:55.901
We have no eggs.

24:55.903 --> 24:57.905
The men took
all the chickens.

25:01.829 --> 25:04.069
Then I shall make
some pottage.

25:04.071 --> 25:06.111
<i>Joanna!</i>

25:06.113 --> 25:08.115
Joanna.

25:08.556 --> 25:09.955
Joanna.

25:09.957 --> 25:11.917
<i>Joanna! Joanna!</i>

25:11.919 --> 25:13.599
Joanna!

25:13.601 --> 25:16.642
Your Highness,
I have bad news.

25:16.644 --> 25:18.244
<i>Your ship is
not yet ready.</i>

25:18.246 --> 25:20.326
<i>¿Qué?</i>
There was a cracked mast.

25:20.328 --> 25:21.687
That is all.

25:21.689 --> 25:23.849
But there was a hole
found upon the stern.

25:23.851 --> 25:25.851
I've just this moment
come from Tilbury.

25:25.853 --> 25:27.493
The carpenters
are working hard,

25:27.495 --> 25:29.495
but they say it'll
take at least a week.

25:29.497 --> 25:32.738
If our ship's not ready,
you will sell us one of yours.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.580
<i>How much gold
to buy a ship?</i>

25:34.582 --> 25:37.143
You cannot say
you do not need it.

25:37.145 --> 25:39.547
We don't have
any ships to spare.

25:41.229 --> 25:43.510
<i>So let
us settle down and eat</i>

25:43.512 --> 25:45.512
and see
how we might trade.

25:45.514 --> 25:48.715
I have another chance
to win my dowry.

25:48.717 --> 25:50.877
Where is Rosa?

25:50.879 --> 25:52.881
I will find her.

25:59.528 --> 26:00.567
<i>Rosa!</i>

26:00.569 --> 26:02.049
- <i>Rosa!</i>
- <i>Rosa!</i>

26:03.612 --> 26:05.614
Rosa!

26:11.981 --> 26:13.620
Rosa!

26:13.622 --> 26:15.625
- Rosa!
- Oviedo.

26:18.548 --> 26:20.550
Oh, Rosa.

26:25.635 --> 26:27.637
He didn't come.

26:31.641 --> 26:34.402
Will you talk to him?

26:34.404 --> 26:36.406
Please, Lina.

26:38.168 --> 26:40.568
Find out what we'll do.

26:40.570 --> 26:42.572
Of course I will.

26:57.548 --> 27:00.108
All is not lost,
Rosa.

27:00.110 --> 27:02.311
The Infanta's
sister stays,

27:02.313 --> 27:05.434
so she might try again
to win her dowry.

27:05.436 --> 27:07.438
God smiles on her.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.363
What, you don't
believe in Allah now?

27:14.085 --> 27:16.805
I know Allah is not the
reason that they stayed.

27:20.771 --> 27:22.852
Will you take her back
to Durham House?

27:22.854 --> 27:25.294
She needs to rest
and warm herself.

27:25.296 --> 27:28.097
I'll tell the Infanta.

27:28.099 --> 27:30.101
<i>Ven.</i>

27:34.706 --> 27:36.466
<i>Lord Stafford?</i>

27:44.476 --> 27:46.478
Joanna?

28:08.060 --> 28:10.060
You are right,

28:10.062 --> 28:13.944
<i>that men control us.</i>

28:13.946 --> 28:16.507
Henry Tudor thinks
he can control my life,

28:16.509 --> 28:18.709
but we are sisters.

28:18.711 --> 28:20.070
We must help each other.

28:21.794 --> 28:24.115
You can help no one.

28:24.117 --> 28:26.717
There is no marriage
you can make now.

28:26.719 --> 28:30.601
You're soiled, have no dowry,
and no rank.

28:30.603 --> 28:32.605
My marriage was not...

28:33.847 --> 28:36.167
I remain...

28:36.169 --> 28:37.168
<i>a maid.</i>

28:39.532 --> 28:42.053
I will sooner believe
in God than that.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.057
It is the truth, Joanna.

28:45.098 --> 28:48.662
I will marry Harry,
Arthur's brother.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.304
He is different
to other men, Joanna.

28:52.306 --> 28:55.387
He has wanted me since
I first came to England,

28:55.389 --> 28:57.389
before I came.

28:57.391 --> 29:01.593
He wrote to me
and told me of his love.

29:01.595 --> 29:03.635
He has walked through fire
to win me,

29:03.637 --> 29:05.839
and now all I need
to have him is...

29:07.281 --> 29:09.283
my dowry to be paid.

29:10.644 --> 29:12.124
Will you help me?

29:12.126 --> 29:16.969
If he is so different,
you do not need a dowry.

29:16.971 --> 29:18.973
He will marry you
for love.

29:21.335 --> 29:23.175
When I am
Queen of England

29:23.177 --> 29:25.858
we can be
each other's allies.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.501
Harry will do
anything I ask of him.

29:28.503 --> 29:31.864
We'd stand with you against
our father and your husband.

29:31.866 --> 29:34.427
England is an ally
Spain needs against the French.

29:34.429 --> 29:37.870
Then we will both be queen
and rule our own lives.

29:37.872 --> 29:39.032
Always
Mother's favorite,

29:39.034 --> 29:40.793
and now you win
in love as well.

29:40.795 --> 29:43.118
We play the hand
we have, Joanna.

29:47.803 --> 29:50.323
The ship's mended.

29:50.325 --> 29:53.006
Any fool can see
that they are lying.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.368
It must be Philip.

29:55.370 --> 29:58.852
He doesn't want me in
Castile, where I rule him,

29:58.854 --> 30:01.294
so he tells them
to keep me here,

30:01.296 --> 30:04.620
just as he locked me
in my room in Flanders.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.304
We rule nothing,
you and I.

30:09.585 --> 30:12.706
But that makes no sense.

30:12.708 --> 30:14.148
If Philip wants
to take your crown,

30:14.150 --> 30:15.749
then he would want
to be in Spain

30:15.751 --> 30:17.833
before our father
takes it for himself.

30:19.235 --> 30:22.036
You think that I am wrong?

30:22.038 --> 30:25.960
Then why do all our horses
have no shoes?

30:25.962 --> 30:27.441
Come. Follow me.

30:27.443 --> 30:29.445
Watch this.

30:57.795 --> 31:01.316
Ah, we all want
peace in Europe, but...

31:01.318 --> 31:06.041
I have labored for it
through my reign,

31:06.043 --> 31:07.402
and we are close.

31:07.404 --> 31:09.485
The king has sacrificed
to win it.

31:09.487 --> 31:13.130
Yet even here in England,
two sides form...

31:14.852 --> 31:17.092
rich nobles and
then the poor people,

31:17.094 --> 31:18.974
who hate you
for their taxes, no?

31:18.976 --> 31:22.057
De la Pool will plunge us
back into bloodshed.

31:22.059 --> 31:25.701
No one benefits from this
assault on the English crown.

31:25.703 --> 31:26.902
You could stop it.
Your father...

31:26.904 --> 31:29.705
My father...

31:29.707 --> 31:31.709
he hates walnuts.

31:34.672 --> 31:38.835
Uh, yes, wall-nuts.
<i>Des noix?</i>

31:38.837 --> 31:40.436
Walnuts?

31:40.438 --> 31:44.040
They give him the gas.
<i>Vraiment terrible.</i>

31:44.042 --> 31:45.762
Yet he keep them

31:45.764 --> 31:48.685
in a great
<i>plateaux d'argent...</i>

31:48.687 --> 31:50.607
silver plate, <i>oui?</i>

31:50.609 --> 31:52.649
For his guests.
They love them.

31:52.651 --> 31:55.131
So now
it's <i>une tradition.</i>

31:55.133 --> 31:58.895
He must eat one walnut
with each favored guest,

31:58.897 --> 32:01.378
even though
there's the consequence.

32:01.380 --> 32:05.945
Now, other men of power
would shun things they detest.

32:06.585 --> 32:10.908
My father
is a Christian man,

32:10.910 --> 32:12.912
so I will tell you this.

32:14.073 --> 32:17.274
My father ate a walnut
with Edmund de la Pool.

32:22.001 --> 32:24.363
You mock us!

32:37.137 --> 32:39.139
Harry?

32:39.779 --> 32:42.220
I barter for the future
of this throne

32:42.222 --> 32:44.302
while you dawdle on the
sidelines making love-play!

32:44.304 --> 32:45.824
What?

32:45.826 --> 32:47.826
You're the one who let
him slip through the net.

32:47.828 --> 32:49.868
You should be in there
negotiating his return!

32:49.870 --> 32:51.750
I do not think
he is important.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.431
You mock us

32:53.433 --> 32:55.714
for our efforts to keep
this throne for you.

32:55.716 --> 32:58.517
Well, perhaps I
will not do it anymore.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.640
Perhaps I will choose
myself a new successor.

33:01.642 --> 33:06.247
Hah! Well, I think God might pass
comment upon that, since I am His heir.

33:07.408 --> 33:10.169
You ungrateful little shit.

33:10.171 --> 33:13.172
One day, you'll not
have us to guide you.

33:13.174 --> 33:15.176
I count the days.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.540
Do not bait me, Father!

33:21.542 --> 33:23.544
I will win!

33:35.677 --> 33:38.197
What made him
so angry?

33:38.199 --> 33:40.079
You, of course.

33:40.081 --> 33:42.083
It's always you.

33:43.965 --> 33:46.648
But I will
not let him break me.

33:52.494 --> 33:54.975
Come.

33:54.977 --> 33:56.979
Let me tend to your eye.

34:34.257 --> 34:36.659
He says that...

34:38.822 --> 34:41.705
there will always be love
in his heart for you.

34:43.106 --> 34:47.991
<i>He says that his situation
has now changed...</i>

34:49.793 --> 34:54.436
and he...he cannot help you.

34:54.438 --> 34:57.639
How? How has it changed?

34:57.641 --> 34:59.643
Rosa, he...

35:04.848 --> 35:07.129
We will help you.

35:07.131 --> 35:08.851
We will find a way.

35:08.853 --> 35:11.535
No! No!

35:19.744 --> 35:23.828
The baby knew
it wasn't wanted...

35:26.230 --> 35:28.232
so it died.

35:39.484 --> 35:40.483
Go!

35:40.485 --> 35:41.724
- Highness.
- Leave us!

35:41.726 --> 35:43.967
Yes, Your Grace.

35:43.969 --> 35:45.608
I need garlic, onion,

35:45.610 --> 35:48.291
and sheep's stomach,
if they have it.

35:48.293 --> 35:50.495
My mother used it
after battle.

35:59.104 --> 36:00.864
Let me kiss you.

36:00.866 --> 36:02.946
Your blood is up.

36:02.948 --> 36:05.028
Let me soothe you first.

36:06.952 --> 36:09.393
A virgin should not
entertain a man alone

36:09.395 --> 36:12.396
if she hopes her reputation
as a maid will be believed.

36:12.398 --> 36:14.398
Joanna, please.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.840
I am tending
to his eye.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.443
We should be acquainted
if you are to be my family.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.966
We met already,

36:21.968 --> 36:24.728
but you had other victims
in your sights.

36:24.730 --> 36:27.291
Victims?

36:27.293 --> 36:29.333
You think
that I have victims?

36:29.335 --> 36:30.615
Joanna, please.

36:30.617 --> 36:32.697
You think
that I am cruel?

36:32.699 --> 36:35.139
Please, don't.

36:35.141 --> 36:39.424
Don't what,
tell him the truth?

36:39.426 --> 36:41.428
You wouldn't like that.

36:42.429 --> 36:46.831
Or perhaps I will
tell you the truth...

36:46.833 --> 36:50.315
of what she did to me...
our mother,

36:50.317 --> 36:53.118
because she loved
her God so much.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.239
What?

36:54.241 --> 36:56.361
Our mother
used to torture me.

36:56.363 --> 36:58.844
You don't remember.

36:58.846 --> 37:00.405
You were too young,

37:00.407 --> 37:02.968
or she kept it
from you,

37:02.970 --> 37:05.170
precious
little Catherine.

37:05.172 --> 37:09.096
She wouldn't want
her pretty babe to know.

37:10.738 --> 37:14.940
She would hang me from a beam or a
hook, like this...

37:14.942 --> 37:16.261
You're mad.
Of course she didn't.

37:16.263 --> 37:18.506
...and tie weights
to my feet.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.628
She thought she could cure
me of my blasphemy.

37:22.630 --> 37:25.791
Our mother was a queen,
a warrior.

37:25.793 --> 37:28.874
It's you who made her ill,
with worry

37:28.876 --> 37:32.198
and with nursing all your children
when she had her own complaints.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.480
I don't know why
you would defend her.

37:34.482 --> 37:36.482
She said you were
not her daughter,

37:36.484 --> 37:40.526
because you lost your husband
and failed to have a child.

37:40.528 --> 37:42.088
She washed
her hands of you.

37:46.254 --> 37:47.694
See?

37:47.696 --> 37:50.419
You're our mother's
daughter after all.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.142
Your dowry's dead.

37:55.544 --> 37:58.066
You won't get
a single coin from me.

38:06.835 --> 38:08.315
Give me my horse.

38:08.317 --> 38:09.476
Give it to me!

38:09.478 --> 38:11.480
Right.

38:16.365 --> 38:17.805
So are you scared of me?

38:17.807 --> 38:18.886
Hah!

38:18.888 --> 38:20.768
Of course not.

38:20.770 --> 38:21.769
You're a girl.

38:23.813 --> 38:26.934
But I will bid you
my goodbye.

38:26.936 --> 38:28.936
Go, then. Run after her.

38:28.938 --> 38:31.939
I'm not running
after anyone.

38:31.941 --> 38:36.784
No? She said you'd do
anything she told you to.

38:36.786 --> 38:38.788
No one tells me
what to do.

38:40.470 --> 38:42.510
I'm...I'm going
to get some wine.

38:42.512 --> 38:44.514
There is wine here.

38:47.677 --> 38:52.080
Unless you're scared
of what your father wants.

38:52.082 --> 38:54.282
Of course I'm not.

38:54.284 --> 38:56.204
<i>Scared to make him angry,</i>

38:56.206 --> 39:01.091
if he thought you had had it
and he had not.

40:16.128 --> 40:18.329
<i>Catherine?</i>

40:18.331 --> 40:20.333
It's Rosa.

43:01.178 --> 43:04.101
Mother,
a letter from the court.

43:10.267 --> 43:12.668
<i>"Our dearest cousin,</i>

43:12.670 --> 43:16.311
<i>"I bid you come to court,
and I will help you with your plight.</i>

43:16.313 --> 43:18.596
<i>His Grace, King Henry VII."</i>

43:22.480 --> 43:24.482
Come.

43:43.702 --> 43:46.302
<i>Not my father,
my grandmother, nor the council...</i>

43:46.304 --> 43:50.587
I did not budge an inch,
Catherine, not with any of them.

43:50.589 --> 43:53.630
I was very clear that I
loved you and that...

43:53.632 --> 43:56.275
that I've never loved another
and I never will.

43:57.716 --> 44:00.437
You must believe me.
You must believe I love you.

44:00.439 --> 44:02.441
I do.

44:03.762 --> 44:07.364
I thought that I
had frightened you.

44:07.366 --> 44:09.887
My...my sister
is unwell, I think.

44:09.889 --> 44:11.568
Oh, I-I care
not one jot for her.

44:11.570 --> 44:14.131
But I should
not have slapped her.

44:14.133 --> 44:16.293
It was wrong of me.

44:16.295 --> 44:17.374
It doesn't matter.

44:17.376 --> 44:19.416
I was upset,

44:19.418 --> 44:23.821
what she said
about our mother.

44:23.823 --> 44:25.463
Is it true?

44:25.465 --> 44:28.426
My mother was a warrior.

44:28.428 --> 44:29.907
She was my inspiration,

44:29.909 --> 44:33.311
and I will love her
to my dying breath.

44:33.313 --> 44:35.555
I will not have
her name besmirched.

44:37.317 --> 44:38.836
Joanna was right,
though.

44:38.838 --> 44:40.598
They tried to stop her
leaving Westminster.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.802
My father wants his enemy
returned, Edmund de la Pool.

44:44.804 --> 44:46.564
Philip's father has him.

44:46.566 --> 44:48.126
My father and my grandmother

44:48.128 --> 44:50.448
want a deal
to have him handed over,

44:50.450 --> 44:54.292
so they'll stop your sister and her
husband leaving until they get it.

44:54.294 --> 44:56.695
Why didn't you tell me?

44:56.697 --> 44:59.257
Joanna can persuade him.

44:59.259 --> 45:01.419
It's her
who wears the crown.

45:01.421 --> 45:05.063
She's the one Maximilian will have
to trade and make a treaty with.

45:05.065 --> 45:07.988
I can have my dowry in
exchange for her escape.

45:12.753 --> 45:14.755
Joanna.

45:15.956 --> 45:18.237
Joanna.

45:18.239 --> 45:20.441
I know how you can free
yourself from here...

45:22.163 --> 45:25.364
and I will tell you,
for a price.

45:25.366 --> 45:26.365
What price?

45:26.367 --> 45:27.526
My dowry.

45:27.528 --> 45:28.527
No.

45:28.529 --> 45:30.531
Joanna...

45:34.375 --> 45:37.657
I know what
you said was true...

45:37.659 --> 45:39.661
what our mother
did to you.

45:41.262 --> 45:42.782
She tried
to keep it from me,

45:42.784 --> 45:44.786
but I remembered...

45:45.787 --> 45:49.791
a moment from when
I was a girl...

45:51.113 --> 45:53.115
and you
were screaming.

45:54.756 --> 45:56.758
I'm sorry.

45:58.640 --> 46:00.881
How do I
free myself from here?

46:00.883 --> 46:03.405
Give me your word
you will pay my dowry.

46:08.651 --> 46:11.732
<i>You must write to Philip's
father, Maximilian,</i>

46:11.734 --> 46:14.895
<i>and tell him to return the York
man, Edmund de la Pool.</i>

46:14.897 --> 46:16.417
<i>Philip will try
to stop you,</i>

46:16.419 --> 46:18.459
<i>because he means
to take your power,</i>

46:18.461 --> 46:20.461
<i>but you are queen,
and the power is all yours.</i>

46:20.463 --> 46:21.742
He'll never...

46:21.744 --> 46:24.747
I have come
to trade with you.

46:29.232 --> 46:31.512
You want Edmund de
la Pool returned?

46:31.514 --> 46:33.474
My husband has misled you.

46:33.476 --> 46:36.317
<i>His father
will do nothing for him,</i>

46:36.319 --> 46:39.640
whereas I am queen of Spain,

46:39.642 --> 46:43.046
and Maximilian needs
to keep his treaty with me.

46:59.543 --> 47:03.585
Maggie, you are
here at court.

47:03.587 --> 47:06.348
I have come
to see the king.

47:06.350 --> 47:08.352
I hope
you received my letter.

47:09.954 --> 47:12.794
I wrote to you of my sadness
at your husband's passing,

47:12.796 --> 47:16.280
and...and now
I have lost my mother.

47:17.722 --> 47:19.724
I'm sorry.

47:20.885 --> 47:23.846
They are both
of them with God.

47:23.848 --> 47:26.609
Lady Pole.

47:26.611 --> 47:27.890
<i>This way, please.</i>

47:27.892 --> 47:31.736
I hope our paths
may cross again.

47:34.779 --> 47:36.819
<i>Maximilian is a Christian man,</i>

47:36.821 --> 47:40.743
and the reason why he will not
hand de la Pool over to you

47:40.745 --> 47:44.507
<i>is because he thinks he'll
lose his head upon your block.</i>

47:44.509 --> 47:48.311
<i>Swear on this splinter
of the one true cross</i>

47:48.313 --> 47:51.074
that his life
will be spared,

47:51.076 --> 47:53.837
and I will see to it
that your request is granted.

47:53.839 --> 47:56.760
This is playacting.
You don't believe in God.

47:56.762 --> 48:01.647
But you do, and Maximilian knows
that, so he will trust it.

48:06.652 --> 48:08.932
I, Henry, King of England
and Lord of Ireland,

48:08.934 --> 48:10.734
do swear
on this most holy relic

48:10.736 --> 48:12.576
stained with the blood
of Our Savior,

48:12.578 --> 48:14.978
that no harm shall
befall Edmund de la Pool

48:14.980 --> 48:17.461
on his return to England,
so help me God.

48:17.463 --> 48:21.185
Then I will tell the emperor he
must send him back to England

48:21.187 --> 48:24.150
<i>or lose all trade
with Spain.</i>

48:29.996 --> 48:31.998
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

48:35.161 --> 48:37.163
Your Highness.

48:48.575 --> 48:50.215
Lady Margaret.

48:50.217 --> 48:52.219
You thought
I was the king?

48:53.380 --> 48:54.819
<i>Most letters
come through me,</i>

48:54.821 --> 48:57.102
<i>and I didn't see fit
to pass yours on to him.</i>

48:57.104 --> 49:01.028
It seemed to me
a woman's matter.

49:02.870 --> 49:05.871
I only want
to save my children.

49:05.873 --> 49:07.993
They are small.

49:07.995 --> 49:09.955
<i>They're innocent.</i>

49:09.957 --> 49:11.959
<i>None of this is their fault.</i>

49:13.200 --> 49:15.360
Please.

49:15.362 --> 49:16.882
They are starving.

49:16.884 --> 49:18.886
And they shall receive.

49:20.408 --> 49:23.291
All their mother has to
do is confess her sins.

49:29.137 --> 49:31.539
Unburden yourself,
Lady Pole.

49:33.021 --> 49:35.143
The weight
must be immense.

49:36.664 --> 49:38.785
The Spanish princess
and Prince Arthur

49:38.787 --> 49:40.506
performed
their marriage duties.

49:40.508 --> 49:42.068
They knew each other.

49:42.070 --> 49:46.955
All you have to do is
say it in the face of God.

49:48.076 --> 49:49.355
The face of God?

49:49.357 --> 49:52.479
And then your children
will be saved,

49:52.481 --> 49:56.325
and they will grow
to live full, happy lives.

49:57.606 --> 50:00.807
There is no depth
you will not sink to,

50:00.809 --> 50:02.849
no evil
you will not peddle,

50:02.851 --> 50:04.571
no cruelty
you would spare.

50:04.573 --> 50:06.653
I would warn you, Lady
Pole, to watch your words.

50:06.655 --> 50:11.178
No. I have watched my words
and deeds my whole life,

50:11.180 --> 50:14.221
and tell me,
how far has that got me?

50:14.223 --> 50:17.825
You Tudors killed my brother
in cold blood.

50:17.827 --> 50:22.870
You crush anyone and anything in
the path of your foul power lust.

50:22.872 --> 50:25.192
Well, maybe hunger
has made me mad,

50:25.194 --> 50:29.076
but I will not be an
instrument of yours, my lady.

50:29.078 --> 50:32.119
That was
my last olive branch.

50:32.121 --> 50:35.645
You and your spawn can die in the
gutter, where you belong!

50:57.628 --> 50:59.187
The deal is made.

50:59.189 --> 51:02.110
Your Highness, I have
a second matter to discuss

51:02.112 --> 51:05.434
that would ensure a pact
between Castile and England

51:05.436 --> 51:07.756
for all the years to come.

51:07.758 --> 51:09.760
Will you hear it?

51:13.604 --> 51:14.643
Let us sit.

51:19.290 --> 51:22.173
Good day to you,
oh secret one.

51:28.780 --> 51:31.823
The Infanta's sister is
being held at Westminster.

51:33.344 --> 51:37.108
I think that you removed
their horses' shoes, no?

51:39.070 --> 51:40.910
I am a soldier.

51:40.912 --> 51:42.912
I take orders.

51:42.914 --> 51:46.236
So now they pay me,
three shillings a week.

51:47.799 --> 51:50.840
I save it for our wedding.

51:50.842 --> 51:54.166
So, what else are
you keeping secret?

51:59.571 --> 52:03.333
All places on your body
I would like to know...

52:03.335 --> 52:05.337
when we are wed.

52:11.503 --> 52:15.025
We are blessed
to have each other,

52:15.027 --> 52:19.069
and the Infanta,
she is blessed now, too,

52:19.071 --> 52:23.636
because she'll have her
dowry and her prince.

52:46.539 --> 52:48.860
You needn't look
at me like that.

52:48.862 --> 52:50.864
You will not win.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.601
<i>Is it done?</i>

53:08.042 --> 53:09.761
Did you succeed?

53:09.763 --> 53:11.884
We came to terms,

53:11.886 --> 53:13.886
so Philip and I
will leave tomorrow,

53:13.888 --> 53:17.970
and their traitor, de la Pool,
will soon be shipped back here.

53:17.972 --> 53:19.932
And you will pay
my dowry?

53:19.934 --> 53:24.857
You were right that an alliance
between Spain and England

53:24.859 --> 53:26.899
keeps me safer
in my reign,

53:26.901 --> 53:29.862
but it's stronger
if the alliance

53:29.864 --> 53:33.586
is between my children
and this crown,

53:33.588 --> 53:35.748
so I have made a marriage

53:35.750 --> 53:38.511
between my son
and Princess Mary.

53:38.513 --> 53:41.754
<i>It was proposed
by Lady Margaret.</i>

53:41.756 --> 53:44.479
We do not need you,
Catherine.
