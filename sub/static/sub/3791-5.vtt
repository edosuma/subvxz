01:28.589 --> 01:30.089
- Hey, Ari.
- Where are you?

01:30.174 --> 01:32.133
It sounds like you're getting
fucked with a jackhammer.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.719
- $10 in the curse jar, Daddy.
- Sorry, baby.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.388
- I'm test-driving a new car.
- Matchbox or Hot Wheels?

01:37.473 --> 01:40.308
Funny. Vince feels bad about
giving away my Maserati.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.560
Wow! When my father
gave away my car

01:42.644 --> 01:45.229
I was forced to lose my virginity
on the back of a moped.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.107
- What do you want?
- The road to Bogota starts here, E.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.276
You want "Medellin," you got to
get Warner Brothers

01:50.360 --> 01:52.779
to dry-dock "Aquaman 2"
for 90 days.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.531
Just talk to Haggis' people.
That's what they need.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.949
We'll tell Alan that
when we see him.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.910
He's the head
of the studio, E.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.120
We don't tell him shit.
We ask nicely.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.414
Ari, Vince really wants
to do "Medellin. "

02:03.499 --> 02:04.957
He already started
learning Spanish.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.460
I know. He left
15 messages on the machine.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.252
The wife thinks
I'm fucking the gardener.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.130
What the fuck?!

02:11.215 --> 02:13.591
11:00, E.
Don't be late.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.723
A little early, isn't it, Gold?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.308
That your car, Max?

02:23.227 --> 02:24.310
Yeah.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.437
It's blocking my driveway.

02:26.522 --> 02:29.106
Oh, sorry. My driver must've
forgotten to move it.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.192
If I give you the keys,
pull it around for me?

02:31.276 --> 02:34.278
Who's in charge of you?
I'd like to speak to an adult.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.155
My folks are skiing Gstaad.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.158
You want to complain about me,
you can try my agent or my housekeeper.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.786
Inez's English is for shit,
but she's home.

02:43.914 --> 02:47.083
Make sure that I don't see you
anywhere near my daughter.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.552
You like it?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.805
Yeah, I like it,
but I don't need it.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.265
But you'll take it?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.475
Yeah, I'll take it.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.811
Good to see you finally embracing
your inner mooch, E.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.938
What about you, Johnny?
You pick?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.817
Really, Vince?
Oh, I don't know.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.861
Come on, we took
down Spidey!

03:14.945 --> 03:18.197
What kind of Aquaman would I be
if I didn't take care of my super friends?

03:18.282 --> 03:20.992
Oh, who loves you, bro?
I'll take blue.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.535
So, this beast is for me?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.621
Actually, Turtle, I have
another surprise in store for you.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.123
Really?

03:27.457 --> 03:29.625
Big Boy is gonna play
one of Saigon's tracks on the air.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.503
Are you serious? I've been
trying to get him airplay for a year.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.171
He's gonna give your number
to anyone who calls in.

03:34.256 --> 03:38.175
Get out of here!
That's awesome, Vince. Thank you.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.221
- Am I getting a car?
- Oh, Jesus.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.682
- I thought that was better than a car.
- Greedy bastard.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.226
- Nice, Turtle.
- You're right, it is better. I'm sorry.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.270
I mean, I figure
Saigon blows up,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.272
you might actually be able
to buy your own things.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.816
You're right. I want
to be able to stand on my own.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.568
Thank you, Vince.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.613
I'm just fucking with you.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.364
- Of course you're gonna get one.
- Tool.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.867
- Idiot.
- Tool idiot with an Aston Martin.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.577
So we're gonna take
all these to the studio?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.079
Unless you think we're gonna look
like schmucks driving the same car.

04:07.331 --> 04:10.750
We'd be schmucks in Jettas.
In Aston Martins we look good.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.169
- And independently wealthy.
- Good point.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.255
Last one on the lot
pays tax and title.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.507
- Fuck that.
Oh, Turtle.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.593
- Put on Big Boy.
- Now?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.720
Yeah, right now.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.350
Yeah, baby.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.073
Vince, it don't stop ringing.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.034
Hello? Yeah, I represent him.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.955
Can I call you back in an hour
when I get to my office?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.749
Vince, this is getting nuts.
You think Ari would talk to me?

04:51.833 --> 04:54.669
- Why would Ari talk to you?
- 'Cause I'm in play.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.546
Hello? Yeah, he's my guy.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.757
What, I'm not Persian enough
to get one of those, Vince?

04:59.841 --> 05:01.550
Get us 90 days
and then we'll talk.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.554
Vince, last time
you were here

05:05.639 --> 05:08.474
I told you I wanted you
in the Warner's family, right?

05:08.558 --> 05:12.937
Well now, I'm gonna show
you how we treat family.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.232
Dana.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.405
I'm like the studio's
Vanna White.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.580
That's some allowance.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.416
Yeah, about $1 million
more than your old one.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.002
Wow. Thank you.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.754
No, Vince, thank you.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.840
Now we feel this is
the start of a very

05:40.924 --> 05:42.967
very successful relationship.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.386
Yeah, uh, listen...

05:45.470 --> 05:49.223
Vince is so excited that
we're doing "Aquaman 2."

05:49.307 --> 05:51.600
- That's good to hear.
- But before we get into...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.853
Before we jump
into the tank,

05:54.146 --> 05:55.813
Vinnie's got
a little passion project

05:55.897 --> 05:58.232
that he was really hoping
to sink his teeth into.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.444
Well, passion's important, right?
What is it, Vince?

06:01.528 --> 06:04.739
It's Paul Haggis's "Medellin. "
Pablo Escobar's story.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.491
"Medellin"!
Hell of a script.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.952
Wow, Vince,
that's a great role for you.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.122
- What do you need from me?
- We, uh...

06:13.331 --> 06:16.042
- we have a slight scheduling conflict.
- Very slight.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.794
Mm-hmm, and you'd like me
to push back our start date.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.880
That's all we're asking.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.715
Well, for how long?
I've got a water tank

06:22.799 --> 06:25.217
the size of the Staples Center
out on stage five.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.927
Who's gonna pay
my utility bill?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.347
Well, I have a $1 million check.
How big of a bill is it?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.611
ARl: 90 days, that's it.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.113
It'll really give people a chance
to see a different side of me.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.908
You realize how important this franchise
is to the studio though, right?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.993
I do. And it's important
to me too.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.289
I could give you 65 days.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.416
Will that help?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.001
Enormously.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.172
So what are we supposed
to do with 65 days?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.924
What are you talking about?
Paul Haggis comes from TV.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.259
He could shoot 40 pages in a day.
He can do this.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.178
I hope so.
What's wrong, Johnny?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.430
This guy's been
on the phone the whole time.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.890
Vince, I need help.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.267
I got to get back to the office.
Anything else I can do for you?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.520
- Just set the Haggis meeting.
- Already done. What else?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.271
- Pray.
- Done. What else?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.481
Ahem!

07:20.941 --> 07:24.860
Uh, I want you to talk to Turtle.
He needs some help with Saigon.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.072
- What, is he moving there?
- He's my rapper, Ari, and he's blowing up.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.991
- Okay, you got five minutes.
- No, I need a sit-down.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.870
- He needs a sit-down.
- Okay, you know what?

07:35.038 --> 07:36.997
I'm going to be at Equinox.
I'll be at the juice bar.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.542
Triple berry dreamsicles
on me, okay?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.252
I was thinking someplace
more like Spago.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.379
You know, where people
would see me with you.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.882
- 1:00, no sweatsuit.
- Fair enough.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.720
Are you 100%
el certainto it was Max?

07:51.805 --> 07:55.349
Yes, Miss Sarah, she was
on phone with that Max

07:55.433 --> 07:57.017
talking about a boat trip.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.644
Damn.
Did she catch you?

07:58.728 --> 08:01.689
No no, but when I asked
about her plans for today

08:01.773 --> 08:03.315
she said nothing.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.985
She never lied
to me before, Mr. Ari.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.112
But she lied!
She lied!

08:08.196 --> 08:11.198
I know, it's that Max. He's trying
to steal our little girl's soul.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.200
It's all right.
Listen, you keep an ear out.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.953
You got a big gift
for Navidad coming, okay?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.915
Was that Mr. Gold
on the phone?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.959
No, that was El Salvador.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.014
Okay, Johnny, you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

08:35.097 --> 08:37.433
Oh, nothing. I guess
I'm the only guy in this house

08:37.517 --> 08:40.186
that doesn't measure up
to the Gold standard.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.145
You want to talk to Ari?
Is that it?

08:42.647 --> 08:45.649
I've been waiting to talk
to Ari for five years.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.027
I'm an actor with no agent.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.863
You know what they say,
an actor with no agent is...

08:51.281 --> 08:53.407
- Is what?
- Is fucked.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.201
All right, I'll call Ari,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.161
but I can't make
him represent you.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.581
Putting me in a room with him
for a real discussion is all I can ask.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.584
He wants us to share a meeting?
That's ridiculous.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.502
Especially since
I had the meeting first.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.379
Ari's a busy guy.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.382
That's fine. I'll take
what I can get. Thank you, bro.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.885
So you're just gonna
hijack my meeting, Drama?

09:12.969 --> 09:15.304
Hey, fuck off, Turtle.
If it wasn't for me,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.889
none of you guys would
even be out here.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.308
If it wasn't for Vince,
none of us would have stayed.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.061
- Yeah, well...
- Well what?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.314
- Shotgun.
- Shotgun?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.233
- On the meeting, I talk first.
- Vince!

09:27.317 --> 09:29.318
The guy called shotgun.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.238
All right, it's time.
Let's go bag us some Haggis.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.323
Let's do it.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.783
Yeah, I got to roll
to my meeting too.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.660
Our meeting,
and I go first.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.663
- Not if I beat you there.
- I called shotgun!

09:41.164 --> 09:42.206
Hey!

09:56.721 --> 09:59.682
- Math club, huh, baby?
Yeah, should be fun.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.643
Never heard of a math club
going on a boat before.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.188
Oh, it's just a bunch
of really smart kids, that's all.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.023
Not smart enough.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.652
- How do you know it's Max?
- A father always knows

10:11.736 --> 10:14.154
when his daughter's lying,
baby, and it's heartbreaking.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.700
I'm not your baby. I'm 14 years old
and you're spying on me.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.369
You can't keep us apart forever.
I love him!

10:20.787 --> 10:22.371
Lis... Sar...

10:32.632 --> 10:35.009
Too slow, jerk-off.
Oh no!

10:36.261 --> 10:37.344
Hey!

10:41.308 --> 10:44.018
- First.
- That's bullshit. I called shotgun.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.228
You can't then go
and call first and negate that.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.481
Your shotgun was called
off location so it means shit.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.650
- We're on location now.
- So?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.736
So, shotgun.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.787
- Hey, E.
- Yeah?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.497
Ari says Haggis
is a little intense.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.750
- I don't want to freak him out.
- So what do you want to do?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.877
- Just keep him calm.
- How?

11:09.961 --> 11:12.963
Whatever he says,
just tell him we'll work it out.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.882
What does that mean?

11:14.966 --> 11:16.425
Means we'll work it out.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.552
- We always do, right?
- Exactly.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.179
Let's go get him.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.598
He's performed live 100 times.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.434
Just 'cause you haven't heard
of him till now doesn't mean shit.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.021
You know what?
Call me then, I've got to go.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.981
Huh. Sorry about that, Ari.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.775
You know how it is.
It's nonstop.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.110
Turn your fucking ringer off,
Turtle, my time is precious.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.199
- It's ringing again, Ari.
- I'm sorry.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.743
Enough with the sorrys.
The clock is ticking, let's go.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.163
Okay, here we go.
I got a two-phase plan.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.625
First, there's 500 CDs pressed
and sitting in the trunk of my car.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.794
So what, you want me to sell them
with you on the promenade?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.797
You crack me up, Ari.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.925
The second phase of the plan
is what I need you for.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.302
I mean, A&R guys have been
calling me all day.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.471
I need you to back me
with the suits.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.808
- He's gonna get a deal, Ari, guaranteed.
- I'm gonna get a piece of that?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.768
No, you're gonna get a piece
of his acting career.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.145
- Does he act?
- All rappers act.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.565
Vince said you were gonna
come here and listen to me...

12:13.650 --> 12:16.318
"Vince said he'd throw me
a piece of pussy because he's famous. "

12:16.403 --> 12:19.071
Whatever you want, Turtle.
Okay, I will rep you.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.407
All right, next.
Impress me, Drama.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.245
Okay.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.960
Every small boy has a dream, Ari.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.963
For some, that dream
is to soar to the heavens

12:36.047 --> 12:38.966
as an astronaut.
For others,

12:39.050 --> 12:42.177
- it's to step out onto a Broadway...
- All right, I'll rep you.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.764
Really? You'll put me
on your client list?

12:45.849 --> 12:48.058
If we don't have to stay
for coffee, yeah.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.982
How the fuck am I supposed
to turn a 90-day shoot into 65 days?

12:55.525 --> 12:56.567
We'll work it out.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.362
Vince, in order to shoot
this movie in Colombia

13:00.447 --> 13:03.031
I had to negotiate
with the government, the drug lords,

13:03.116 --> 13:05.242
the FARC rebels and the fucking right-wing
militia death squads,

13:05.326 --> 13:07.453
and you want me to undo all that?
You out of your mind?

13:07.537 --> 13:10.289
- We'll work it out.
- Why's he keep saying that?

13:10.373 --> 13:12.541
Because he believes we can.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.252
All right, look, Paul.
We just want you to think

13:15.336 --> 13:17.880
about how we can do this,
because we all really want to do it.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.550
Well, it's real easy. All you have to do
is cut 30% of your key scenes.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.179
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on, we all have to compromise.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.473
Okay, how about...
oh, how about this one here?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.766
This is the one where you're being
hunted and you go to your mom

13:29.893 --> 13:31.977
- and you tell her you love her...
- And she spits in my face.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.854
- I love that scene.
- Yeah, it's a good one. It's gone.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.648
- Let's see. What else?
- Paul, I don't want to tell you

13:36.733 --> 13:39.151
about your business, but can't you
just shoot the movie quicker?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.487
I mean, how long did it
take you to shoot "Crash"?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.156
Vince, I loved
what I saw of "Aquaman. "

13:44.240 --> 13:46.366
- Thank you.
- This is not "Aquaman. "

13:46.451 --> 13:49.912
In this movie I want you to play
what I like to call a human being.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.749
See, together I want to humanize one
of the greatest monsters of all time.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.667
What I want is even
after the audience

13:55.752 --> 13:58.670
sees you ruthlessly slaughter
like 1,000 people,

13:59.130 --> 14:00.506
I still want them to care.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.801
I want them to care so much
that when you die they fucking weep.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.179
They won't want to.
They'll hate themselves for it.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.223
But they will fucking weep.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.933
I have to do this movie.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.520
- Paul, he's got a contract.
- A contract? Ah!

14:14.604 --> 14:17.523
If I let contracts rule my life,
I'd still be doing "The Facts of Life"

14:17.607 --> 14:19.942
rather than hanging
with my boys.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.119
- Thanks, Esteban.
- Okay.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.039
- Hey, Ariel Gold.
- Hey, Penny.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.251
Only my mom calls me that
and still I better have a fever of 103.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.877
- How are you?
- Okay.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.505
- I was just up seeing one of your guys.
- Oh yeah? Who?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.340
We're looking at Jimmy Whitaker

14:43.424 --> 14:45.676
for the Encyclopedia Brown trilogy.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.179
Jimmy Whitaker, the pride and joy
of my young burgeoning teen division.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.056
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
let's make a deal.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.060
You do the whole "schlemiel, schlimazel,
Hasenpfeffer Incorporated"

14:55.144 --> 14:58.313
- he's all yours, all right?
- Don't be a schmuck, Ari, okay?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.523
- What?
- It's a great project.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.400
It's gonna be a heck
of a franchise.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.151
The first one takes
place in the Kremlin.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.238
Really? Good luck
faking Moscow in Vancouver.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.532
No no no.
The hell with Vancouver.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.493
We're doing it right.
24 weeks in Kazakhstan.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.746
- Kazakhstan?
- Mm-hmm.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.458
Jimmy Whitaker
is a spoiled prick.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.461
You want to hire Max Ballard.
He's Dakota Fanning with a dick.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.921
I heard Ballard was difficult.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.965
He's my next-door neighbor.
He is humble as pie.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.467
I have been trying
to sign that kid for years.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.012
Wow, Ari.
He's not even one of your guys.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.181
I am a team player.
Boom! You owe me. Come here.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.434
- Max Ballard.
- Ballard.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.644
- Quit smoking.
- All right.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.442
Uh-oh.
What happened, E?

15:43.526 --> 15:45.736
Haggis trying to cast you
as a pygmy drug mule?

15:45.820 --> 15:49.031
- Vince wants off "Aquaman. "
- What is this, deja vu all over again?

15:49.115 --> 15:51.450
- What did Haggis say?
- He said he needs all 90 days.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.162
Noah can build an ark and save
all of God's creatures in 40 days.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.372
He can't shoot a movie in 65?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.916
- Is there anything you can do?
- I can't control Haggis.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.377
Well what if we call Cameron?
I can't even believe he's ready

16:02.462 --> 16:04.046
to do "A2" so soon.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.799
He's not signed on to do "A2."

16:08.217 --> 16:10.677
- What?
- He just signed on to do the first one.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.471
Then why is Vince
signed on for three?

16:12.555 --> 16:13.972
That's the way it works
with actors.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.307
Cameron was the only
reason I did the movie

16:15.391 --> 16:16.892
in the first place.
Who's directing?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.729
- Michael Bay.
- Jesus Christ!

16:20.813 --> 16:23.482
- They're just rushing this thing out.
- Listen, Vinnie.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.818
This is what studios do.
The thing is a monster hit.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.904
They're just trying to take
advantage of it, that's all.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.822
- I haven't even seen a script.
- They're working on it.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.283
- Andrew Kevin Walker writing?
- Kevin Smith.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.745
- Oh boy.
- Fuck you, Ari. I want off this movie.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.413
We'll go to Warner's,
we'll ask them for more days.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.249
There are no more days. What are
you talking about? You were there.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.835
Alan was nice enough to give us 65.
He didn't even have to do that.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.338
- I'm not doing this movie.
- Vince, you signed a contract.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.548
And I know that you
are a man of your word.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.385
Oh yeah, and are you?
Are you a man of your word, Ari?

16:51.469 --> 16:54.054
- I never lied to you.
- You told me if I did "Aquaman,"

16:54.138 --> 16:56.181
- that I could get "Medellin. "
- You got "Medellin. " I can't help

16:56.265 --> 17:00.102
the timing. Listen, I would if I could.
Remember, I don't get paid shit on this.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.020
It all goes
to my former employer.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.356
Look, Vinnie, I know that
you would kill that role.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.108
I know the timing sucks.
But be a man.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.911
I'll call Haggis,
tell him I'm off the movie.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.663
I'm sorry, Vinnie.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.217
- Just running this shit all day, huh?
All day.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.761
This keeps up, you'll have to get
your own channel on Sirius.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.513
Yeah, I got to say, Turtle,

17:36.597 --> 17:39.266
took you longer than you promised, man,
but you came through.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.143
You ain't seen nothing yet.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.311
Hey, yo, Keshawn,
let me get the box, man.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.277
- Yo, you got me a gift?
- Just a little something.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.946
Sai, don't go spending all
your money just yet, man.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.159
- Try it on.
- Yo, I can't accept this.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.911
No, don't worry. They're CZs
but I plan on replacing them

17:59.996 --> 18:01.496
as soon as I can afford it.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.792
That's tight, man.
Thank you.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.258
- Oh, hey, Paul.
- Hey. I couldn't sleep.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.511
I just keep trying to picture this movie
without Vince and I can't do it.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.847
Well, what can we do?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.474
Brainstorm.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.362
I got nothing.
Nothing.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.448
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.532
Nothing.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.660
You ever consider cutting out
all the flashbacks, Paul?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.164
- No.
Now this may be retarded,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.707
or maybe I'm just baked,

18:46.501 --> 18:49.044
but you said you wanted Vince
to gain 50 Ibs. For the part, right?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.671
70. It's more authentic.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.882
Right, but you still need him
skinny for the early years.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.843
- Yeah.
- So you shoot the first half now

18:56.928 --> 18:58.929
before "Aquaman 2"
while he's skinny.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.307
Shoot the second half after he wraps
when Vince piles on the pasta.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.976
Like De Niro in "Raging Bull. "
- Like Clooney in "Syriana. "

19:05.061 --> 19:07.354
Or Johnny Chase
in "The Commish"

19:07.563 --> 19:09.731
when I played
that bulimic pedophile.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.776
- Did you see that one, Paul?
- No.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.153
But you know what?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.780
- This could work.
- You think?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.157
- This could fucking work, man.
- Definitely.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.700
Fuckin' A!

19:20.785 --> 19:22.118
Good work, E.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.704
Yeah well, somebody's got to
make shit happen when you can't.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.082
Save one pat on your back
for me. Huh, buddy?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.834
Yeah yeah yeah.
Look, you've got to call Alan.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.961
Tell him Vince wants to take him
out to dinner to say thanks.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.171
Wow, our boy is really
becoming a man now, huh?

19:33.256 --> 19:34.714
I'll talk to you later, Ari.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.759
Call Alan at Warner.
Set up a dinner for four, please.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.345
- Today is going to be a big day.
- For you maybe.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.889
Some guy at Atlantic Records
keeps calling me every 10 minutes.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.266
- What does he want?
- I have no idea.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.351
He just keeps saying
something about Saigon.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.061
Saigon?
That's interesting.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.021
- Get him on the phone right now.
- Right now? Okay.

19:56.571 --> 19:59.197
Oh, in the hole!
Just like Tiger at Sawgrass.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.241
Yeah, more like my six-year-old niece
at Nunley's.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.578
Are you kidding?
Atlantic Records called you?

20:04.662 --> 20:07.163
- ARl: Sony and Interscope too.
- Holy shit!

20:07.248 --> 20:10.542
Anyway, tell Vince and E
8:00 at The Palms with Alan.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.752
8:00 at The Palm with Alan.
What else, Ari?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.963
Just make sure
they're on time, Turtle. I got to go.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.715
- Wait, Ari.
- Yeah, Turtle?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.758
- Are you fucking with me?
- A little bit.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.719
- This is sick, right?
- It is sick.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.388
As soon as we settle this stuff with
Vince I'm gonna set up some meetings.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.683
- Your boy's gonna get a deal.
- Holy shit.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.644
I think your life's
about to change, Turtle.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.399
What happened?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.276
Saigon is gonna get a deal!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.403
Ari just said my life
was gonna change.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
- Awesome.
- Come on. Congratulations, buddy.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.407
- Thank you, E.
- Good work.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.869
Vince, thank you so much.
That Big Boy thing put me over the top.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.205
Hey, I'm happy for you, bro.
I'm happy for you.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.679
Come to Daddy, sweetie.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.809
She still mad at me?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.937
- No, she's mad at Max now.
- What did he do?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.855
Took a movie
in Kazakhstan.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.734
I'm so glad our daughter's
tears make you so happy.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.945
Baby, those tears
mean our little girl's

21:20.029 --> 21:22.530
gonna stay our little girl
for at least another day.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.867
Ari...

21:25.952 --> 21:28.536
Now how about a quick blowjob
before my Vince dinner?

21:29.538 --> 21:31.247
What?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.377
Order whatever you want,
Drama, it's on me.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.128
I don't need you to pay
for shit of mine, Turtle.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.465
With Ari on my side my life's
about to change also.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.260
You know, we had "Medellin"
first over at my studio.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.054
- Really?
- Sure, yeah.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.889
- Let it go.
- Why?

21:48.265 --> 21:50.558
Couldn't budget under 130 days.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.727
I was shocked when you said
Haggis was doing it in 90.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.562
Shocked. Didn't think
it was possible.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.440
So you must have thought it was really
impossible to do it in 65 days, huh?

21:57.525 --> 21:58.525
Mm-hmm.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.485
So essentially you sent
us on a fool's errand?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.821
- Well, a little bit.
We delivered.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.573
Oh, yes we did.
And we owe you. Thank you.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.619
Can't let you do it.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.749
- What do you mean?
- Well...

22:14.834 --> 22:17.210
You said if I was back
on November 1 st...

22:17.294 --> 22:20.255
Vince, I've got
a billion-dollar franchise to protect.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.340
Happy Meals, action figures.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.967
I can't risk all that
having my Aquaman

22:24.051 --> 22:26.594
doing three hours of blow
in every multiplex in the country.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.390
But, Alan, you looked me in the eyes
and you said that you'd do this for me.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.516
- You gave me your word.
- I'm sorry.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.935
Alan, a man is only

22:34.020 --> 22:36.980
Vince, it's just business.
Not personal.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.233
Oh. Just business.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.864
All right, then I want
20 million to do "A2"

22:46.115 --> 22:48.616
or I quit.
Nothing personal.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.161
Sorry, I'm late.
Date night with the wife.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.329
She thinks I'm getting popcorn.
What did I miss?

22:54.305 --> 23:00.300
