00:20.934 --> 00:23.500
That a cookie made out
of paper plate.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.066
And this!

00:25.066 --> 00:27.033
That a cookie made out
of pipe cleaner.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.066
And this!

00:29.066 --> 00:31.333
That a cookie made out
of glitter. Yeah.

00:31.333 --> 00:35.133
You know, all these crafts
are making me hungry for cookie!

00:35.133 --> 00:36.367
Ahh, nom nom.

00:36.367 --> 00:37.900

could be so delicious?

01:22.200 --> 01:25.967
Oh, hi!
Welcome to Sesame Street!

01:25.967 --> 01:27.300
- Hey, Elmo.
- Oh. Hi, Alan.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.867
What's all this?

01:28.867 --> 01:31.967
Well, Elmo has an arts
and crafts playdate
with Zoe today,

01:31.967 --> 01:35.767
so Elmo brought
all these things
to make art with.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.400
Alan:
Well, what do you know?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.967
I'm doing a little painting
myself today on that old chair.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.533
- Wow.
- Yeah. All right.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.266
Anyways, I'm gonna get back
to it. Have fun.

01:43.266 --> 01:45.033
- Be careful with the paint.
- I will!

01:45.033 --> 01:46.533
- Ha ha ha!
- Hey, Elmo.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.100
Hi, Zoe!

01:48.100 --> 01:49.934
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late,

01:49.934 --> 01:52.033
but Rocco had to go
to the potty.

01:52.033 --> 01:53.333
But Rocco's just a rock.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.533
Well, Rocco
needed a bathroom.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.734
Oh, well. Elmo's glad
you're here

01:57.734 --> 02:00.967
because now Elmo and Zoe
can start our playdate!

02:00.967 --> 02:02.066
Yeah!

02:02.066 --> 02:03.633
What? Oh.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.166
Wait, wait.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.633
Oh. Oh, no.

02:07.633 --> 02:09.133
What now?

02:09.133 --> 02:12.300
Well, Rocco says
he wants his own playdate.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.500
Well, just--
then find another rock.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.200
Oh, Rocco doesn't like
to play with rocks.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.333
Well, why not?

02:19.333 --> 02:22.033
He thinks rocks are boring.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.667
What?

02:23.667 --> 02:26.734
Yeah. I don't know if you
know much about rocks, Elmo,

02:26.734 --> 02:28.567
but rocks don't do much.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.033
They just sit there.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.667
You mean, like Rocco?

02:31.667 --> 02:34.300
Oh, don't be silly.
Rocco's different.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.734
Rocco's a rock who likes
to live life to the fullest.

02:38.734 --> 02:39.867
Oh, okay, Zoe.

02:39.867 --> 02:41.600
What kind of friend
does Rocco want?

02:43.233 --> 02:47.734
Mmm. Rocco says he wants
a friend who is loyal,

02:47.734 --> 02:49.133
a friend who has dreams.

02:49.133 --> 02:50.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
okay.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.100
A friend who
loves adventure.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.734
Okay, okay, okay.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.100
Plus he has to be round.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.066
What!

02:57.066 --> 03:00.300
What can I say?
Rocco's very particular.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.266
Well, if Elmo finds Rocco
a friend,

03:02.266 --> 03:04.934
then can Elmo and Zoe
play arts and crafts?

03:04.934 --> 03:06.400
- Sure.
- Okay, okay.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.533
Then Elmo's off
to find Rocco
a round friend.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.367
Oh, boy, Rocco!

03:12.367 --> 03:15.200
Isn't this exciting?
Heh heh heh!

03:15.200 --> 03:17.967
Okay. Here's Rocco's
new round friend.

03:17.967 --> 03:21.033
Oh. Uh, what do
you think, Rocco?

03:21.033 --> 03:23.233
Well?

03:23.233 --> 03:25.166
Rocco says he's not sure.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.567
Well, why not?

03:26.567 --> 03:29.934
Rocco says he wanted
a friend with a face.

03:29.934 --> 03:32.100
- And hair.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.100
Let's make a friend

See that?
What does Rocco think?

04:28.066 --> 04:30.000
Rocco wants
to know his name.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.233
Wha

04:31.233 --> 04:33.834
Zoe,
but it's just a balloon!

04:33.834 --> 04:36.033
A balloon
that needs a name!

04:36.033 --> 04:39.033
Oh, all right.
His name is Balloon-o.

04:39.033 --> 04:40.066
Here.

04:40.066 --> 04:44.033
Oh. Rocco likes Balloon-o.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.467
Good. Now can
Elmo and Zoe play?

04:46.467 --> 04:49.000
Oh, sure, but just one minute.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.033
Okay, but hurry!

04:50.033 --> 04:51.300
Here we go!

04:51.300 --> 04:54.100
Jump, Balloon-o, jump!

04:55.934 --> 05:00.934
Zoe:
Wow! Balloon-o sure can
jump high, can't he, Rocco?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.500
Elmo:
Uh-oh.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.633
Rocco wants to know when
Balloon-o's coming back down.

05:06.633 --> 05:11.533
Uh, Elmo doesn't think
Balloon-o is coming back down.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.500
Well, oh, no!

05:13.500 --> 05:17.367
Rocco's upset, and it's
all Balloon-o's fault.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.000
Don't blame Balloon-o.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.033
He's just
an innocent balloon.

05:21.033 --> 05:23.367
A balloon that broke
Rocco's heart!

05:23.367 --> 05:25.367
- But he-- he--
- Hey, hey, guys, guys.

05:25.367 --> 05:29.066
I saw what happened,
and I know why Balloon-o
floated away.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.433
Was it because
he didn't like Rocco?

05:31.433 --> 05:34.734
No, no. It floated away
because it was filled
with helium,

05:34.734 --> 05:38.166
which is lighter than air,
and so it floats.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.100
Wasn't because
he didn't like Rocco.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.100
Okay, now that Balloon-o
is gone,

05:42.100 --> 05:43.734
can Elmo and Zoe play?

05:43.734 --> 05:47.066
Well, how-- how can I play
at a time like this?

05:47.066 --> 05:49.600
My Rocco still needs
a friend.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.200
Another friend?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.367
Well, didn't you have fun
making Balloon

05:53.367 --> 05:55.900
Well, yeah.
Elmo guesses so.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.166
So do you think you could make
another friend for Rocco?

06:00.166 --> 06:02.166
Okay. Elmo will do it.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.600
Now what kind of friend should
Elmo make this time? Hmm.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.266
Well, Rocco doesn't want
another friend to float away,

06:09.266 --> 06:12.934
so maybe this friend
should be made

06:12.934 --> 06:16.033
of something heavier
than a balloon.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.967
That's good thinking,
Zoe.

06:17.967 --> 06:19.500
It was Rocco's idea.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.567
Oh. Well, then,
good thinking, Rocco.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.367
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.533
Okay. Something heavier
than a balloon. Hmm.

06:29.533 --> 06:33.900
And Rocco wants to remind you
that it should be round.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.166
Round. Right.
Ooh, ooh!

he can't say hello

07:23.900 --> 07:26.100
till he knows
his new friend's name.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.734
Uh, his name
is Eggy. Here.

07:29.734 --> 07:32.100
Hello, Eggy.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.734
What, Rocco?

Uh-huh.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.033
Yeah, yeah! Ha!

07:37.033 --> 07:38.767
That sounds really fun.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.133
What does?

07:40.133 --> 07:43.000
Rocco wants to play
patty-cake with Eggy.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.533
Oh, good.
Eggy likes that game.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.066

07:51.000 --> 07:53.266
- Eggy!
- Oh, no!

07:53.266 --> 07:55.400
What did Rocco
do to Eggy?

07:55.400 --> 07:59.300
Rocco didn't mean to,
and he feels just terrible.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.300
Oh, there, there,
Rocco. Don't cry.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.000
Guys,
what happened this time?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.667
Well, Elmo made Rocco
a beautiful egg friend,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.300
but Rocco broke him!

08:07.300 --> 08:10.433
Oh. Well, Elmo, it really
wasn't Rocco's fault.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.567
See, eggshells are
very fragile,

08:13.567 --> 08:15.100
so they can crack easily.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.700
Oh. See, Rocco?

08:16.700 --> 08:18.467
It's not your fault.

08:18.467 --> 08:22.000
I'm gonna get something
to clean this up.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.967
You owe Rocco an apology.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.400
But Rocco's just a rock!

08:25.400 --> 08:27.734
A rock whose feelings
are hurt.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.433
Oh. Sorry, Rocco.

08:29.433 --> 08:31.367
Rocco says,
"Thank you."

08:31.367 --> 08:35.033
But Elmo doesn't think
he can ever make Rocco
the right friend.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.367
Oh, sure,
you can, Elmo.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.000
You just haven't found
a friend

08:38.000 --> 08:40.100
made out of the right kind
of materials yet.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.967
Okay. So Elmo needs
to make a friend

08:42.967 --> 08:44.133
that's not too light.

08:44.133 --> 08:46.734
Mm-hmm.
Or too fragile.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.500
That's right.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.900
But-- but then what can
Rocco's friend be made of?

08:51.900 --> 08:53.467
Ooh!
Stop, stop, stop!

08:53.467 --> 08:56.033
- Stop! The sponge, Alan!

08:56.033 --> 08:58.066
Is Alan's sponge round?

08:58.066 --> 08:59.667
Uh, yeah. Why?

08:59.667 --> 09:03.400
Well, Elmo thinks he could
find the perfect playdate

09:03.400 --> 09:07.066
friend for Rocco,
and his name is, um...

09:07.066 --> 09:09.400
ooh, sponge--
Spongerino!

09:09.400 --> 09:12.200
Ha ha! Because sponges aren't
lighter than air,

09:12.200 --> 09:14.400
so they won't float away.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.367
Ooh! He's not fragile,
so he won't crack.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.934
Yeah!

Spongerino!

10:12.066 --> 10:13.600
All right.
Let's try playing together.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.533
Bounce, bounce, bounce,
jump, jump, jump.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.600
- Spongerino jumps
without floating away.
- Yeah!

10:18.600 --> 10:20.533
Elmo and Zoe:
♪ Patty-cake, patty-cake... ♪

10:20.533 --> 10:23.467
And he plays patty-cake
without cracking!

10:23.467 --> 10:24.500
Oh, yeah!

10:24.500 --> 10:26.200
- Ooh!

10:26.200 --> 10:29.233
Oh, he thinks he's found
the perfect friend.

10:29.233 --> 10:31.533
- Aw. Ha ha ha!
- Great work, you guys.

10:31.533 --> 10:34.066
All right. Have fun with
your new friend, Rocco.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.266
- Okay.
- Thanks, Alan!

10:35.266 --> 10:36.767
Rocco says he will.

10:36.767 --> 10:37.967
- All right.
- Thanks.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.700
Ooh, ooh!

10:39.700 --> 10:43.500
Does Zoe still want
to play with Rocco
and Spongerino?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.600
Mmm. No.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.633
No?

10:46.633 --> 10:50.467
I want to play my playdate
with you, Elmo.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.400
Oh, yay! Ooh! Let's make
arts and crafts together!

10:53.400 --> 10:56.100
Oh, yeah. Right!
What should we make?

10:56.100 --> 10:57.166
Um, let's see. Ooh!

10:57.166 --> 10:59.100
How about more friends
for Rocco?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.333
Elmo can't believe
he said that.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.233
Ooh, yeah. Good idea.
I love these colors.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.033
Oh. Yeah.
They are nice,
aren't they?

11:04.033 --> 11:06.000
- Um, let's see.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.100
Oh, we think that's neat.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.400
Do you know
what time it is?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.867
♪ Hold tight, it's time

11:17.867 --> 11:20.767

All: "C"!

11:58.033 --> 12:00.633
Boy:
"C" is for crafts.

12:00.633 --> 12:03.100
Tonight,
I'm celebrating Diwali

12:03.100 --> 12:04.734
with my family and friends.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.800
Diwali is a Hindu festival

12:06.800 --> 12:09.367
that's celebrated
all over the world.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.133
My friends are all bringing
Diwali lanterns,

12:12.133 --> 12:15.066
but first,
they have to make them.

12:15.066 --> 12:17.033
They're using all sorts
of crafts

12:17.033 --> 12:19.834
like paper, glue,
and glitter.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.734
Decorating these lanterns makes
each one unique and special.

12:23.734 --> 12:28.166
Look. My friend Cami is using
yellow paper with a pattern,

12:29.367 --> 12:32.100
and this one
has glitter on it.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.000
We cut holes in the lanterns

12:34.000 --> 12:36.633
to let the light
shine through.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.867
Diwali is known as
the festival of lights.

12:41.867 --> 12:45.700
Now it's time to celebrate.
Happy Diwali!

12:48.834 --> 12:53.100
Our colorful craft lanterns
are the perfect decoration.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.000
Cuh, cuh, crafts.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.800
The letter "C."

12:59.367 --> 13:01.433
Teacher:
These shapes
are called sculptures.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.433
Let's see how easy it is
to make a sculpture.

13:03.433 --> 13:05.100
We're gonna make
a big paper sculpture.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.767
Now if we want to make
something big,

13:06.767 --> 13:09.133
what kind of paper
do you think would
be best to use?

13:09.133 --> 13:10.900
- Tissue paper!

13:10.900 --> 13:12.934
- Lauren: No.
- Why wouldn't
this work, Lauren?

13:12.934 --> 13:14.633
Because it rips too easily.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.367
Teacher:
It's not strong enough?
Why don't we try this?

13:16.367 --> 13:19.033
How's this stuff to fold
if we want to fold some of this?

13:19.033 --> 13:20.233
- Boy: Hard.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.767
What happens
when you fold it?

13:21.767 --> 13:23.300
How does that fold look?
Does it look good?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.066
- Not so good a fold.
- Teacher: Yeah.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.834
- Yeah.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.467
- Teacher: What makes
this better?
- Lauren: It's thicker.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.133
It's not too hard,
and it's not too soft,

13:31.133 --> 13:33.734
so you're able
to fold it easier.

13:33.734 --> 13:36.000
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna use this paper,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.400
which we decided is
the best paper.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.567
Everybody's gonna help me
make a piece,

13:39.567 --> 13:41.767
and then we're gonna
glue them all together
and make something big.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.867
We're gonna put a crease
in the center like this.

13:43.867 --> 13:46.200
We're gonna fold it in half.
See this line here?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.100
Look. Fold that over
just like that.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.633
Go ahead and push.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.767
You got it. Let's flip it
over and do it again.

13:52.767 --> 13:55.000
- Teacher: It's done. Let's see.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.900
- Ta-da!
- Teacher: You're an expert.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.266
Let's start gluing it together.
What do you say?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.533
Teacher:
Now it's a team effort.
Go ahead and push down.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.367
Push, push, push.
Who's squishing my finger?

14:07.367 --> 14:10.033
- Me!
Argh!
You guys got it.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.400
You guys are
paper-folding masters.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.233
Okay. Get ready.
One, two, three!

14:15.233 --> 14:17.867
Wow!

14:17.867 --> 14:19.200
Awesome!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.967
Teacher:
Grr! It's coming after you!

14:20.967 --> 14:22.734
Ha ha ha!

14:22.734 --> 14:24.367
Teacher:
You guys built this.
Isn't that awesome?

14:24.367 --> 14:26.467
Boy:

Recycled art school!

17:03.100 --> 17:04.967
Oh, boy!

17:04.967 --> 17:06.433
- Hey, hey, Brian.
- Hey, Murray.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.266
Um, I have a question.
For you.

17:08.266 --> 17:09.667
- I'm trying to--

17:09.667 --> 17:11.834
to think what I can make
my mom for her birthday,

17:11.834 --> 17:14.300
and-- and I just
don't have any ideas.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.600
Do you think
you could help me?

17:15.600 --> 17:18.166
Well, we're gonna use
recycled materials

17:18.166 --> 17:19.300
to make
some presents.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.967
Excuse me, uh, Brian.

17:20.967 --> 17:22.967
What does it mean
to recycle?

17:22.967 --> 17:24.734
Recycle means when you
reuse something

17:24.734 --> 17:26.233
instead of
throwing it away.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.066
Really? Well, what kind of
things can you make here

17:29.066 --> 17:31.033
out of recycled things?

17:31.033 --> 17:32.834
What do you think
of this, this car?

17:32.834 --> 17:34.166
I think that car
is awesome!

17:34.166 --> 17:35.533
Where did you buy it?

17:35.533 --> 17:37.000
I didn't buy it.
I made it!

17:37.000 --> 17:39.533
!
- I did. Yeah.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.433
Wait. I can make something
like that cool car?

17:41.433 --> 17:42.400
You can.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.100
Hey.
What are you guys making?

17:44.100 --> 17:46.066
All kids:
Tube monsters!

17:46.066 --> 17:48.100
Ha ha ha!

17:48.100 --> 17:50.000
Oh! Tube monsters.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
My mom's a monster.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.967
That's it!

17:53.967 --> 17:55.900
I'm gonna make
a tube monster
for my mommy

17:55.900 --> 17:58.100
out of
this toilet paper tube.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.800
Okay, Brian.
How do we make it?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.233
All right, everybody.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.967
Everyone's gonna take
one of their tubes.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.000
What I want you to do is
to lay it down flat

18:06.000 --> 18:07.233
and squash it.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.433
Squash it down.

18:08.433 --> 18:10.033
What I want you
to do next

18:10.033 --> 18:11.500
is you're gonna take
your scissors,

18:11.500 --> 18:13.867
and you're gonna cut
a line right down your tube.

18:13.867 --> 18:16.133
You're gonna have
this little ring
when you're done.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.166
We're gonna cut
little triangles
out of the end

18:18.166 --> 18:20.734
so these look like
little monster claws.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.300
What do we do now,
Brian?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.033
We take our arms that
we made and we slip them right

18:25.033 --> 18:27.967
inside these little slits
and slide them down.

18:27.967 --> 18:29.767
Okay.
Ha ha ha!

18:29.767 --> 18:31.633
His hands are in!
Ha ha ha!

18:31.633 --> 18:33.633
Now we're gonna
lay them down flat,

18:33.633 --> 18:36.000
and you can choose markers,
crayons, whatever you want
to do,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.166
and design the monster
any way you like.

18:44.066 --> 18:45.400
Hee hee hee!

18:49.133 --> 18:50.333
Hey, Ovejita!

18:50.333 --> 18:52.800
What does your monster
look like?

18:52.800 --> 18:54.100
- Ooh.
- Hee hee hee!

20:31.734 --> 20:36.033
Oh! Guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.000
Wait for it.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.133
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:41.133 --> 20:44.266
Whoa. Whoa-oa-oa!
Crafts!

20:44.266 --> 20:46.367
Oh. That means
really cool things

20:46.367 --> 20:49.867
you can make with stuff
around the house.

20:49.867 --> 20:53.200
Oh, ho ho ho!
A birdfeeder!

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
Yeah-eah-eah!

20:54.200 --> 20:56.333
Boy, Elmo loves crafts

20:56.333 --> 20:59.567
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:59.567 --> 21:03.367
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.934
Let's call her together.

21:05.934 --> 21:08.433
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:08.433 --> 21:10.934
( chime plays
"Elmo's Song" )

21:10.934 --> 21:12.767
Hello there.

21:12.767 --> 21:16.066
Um, Smartie,
is that you?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.800
Ha ha ha!
It's me, all right.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.667
I'm wearing a mask that
I made out of a paper plate.

21:21.667 --> 21:22.967
Oh, ho ho ho!

21:22.967 --> 21:24.500
Well, that's perfect,
Smartie,

21:24.500 --> 21:28.066
because today Elmo wants
to learn all about crafts!

21:28.066 --> 21:30.033
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:30.033 --> 21:33.033
All:
We look it up!

21:33.033 --> 21:35.033
Looking up info
on crafts.

21:35.033 --> 21:36.967
Here we go.

21:36.967 --> 21:39.033
You can turn rocks
from the yard

21:39.033 --> 21:42.433
into animals like owls.

21:42.433 --> 21:45.433
You can make dolls
out of pipe cleaners,

21:45.433 --> 21:48.233
or you can fold up paper
and make things

21:48.233 --> 21:50.133
like a flower!

21:52.133 --> 21:54.533
Wow! That's so cool!

21:54.533 --> 21:56.467
Wait till I show you
what my older brother Flip

21:56.467 --> 21:58.667
made out of popsicle sticks.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.166
Wow! An airplane!

22:03.166 --> 22:05.567
Happy crafting, Elmo.
See you.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.967
Oh, thank you, Smartie.
Bye-bye.

22:08.967 --> 22:12.233
Hey! That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:12.233 --> 22:14.934
Oh, ho! Let's play
a game together.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.266
Yeah-eah-eah!

22:16.266 --> 22:18.867
Come on, come on.
Ha ha ha!

22:24.567 --> 22:26.734
Oh. Let's try and figure out
which things

22:26.734 --> 22:30.133
from the kitchen we can use
to make crafts.

22:30.133 --> 22:33.734
Are you ready?
Let's play!

22:33.734 --> 22:35.133
Kid:
Cardboard tubes!

22:35.133 --> 22:36.567
Elmo:
Think we can use that?

22:36.567 --> 22:38.166
Kid: Sure.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.033
Kid #2:
Let's use that
ball of string.

22:40.033 --> 22:42.433
Kid #3:
Yeah. String will be great.

22:42.433 --> 22:45.266
Elmo:
What about a kitty cat?

22:45.266 --> 22:47.233
Kid:
Ha ha! No way!

22:47.233 --> 22:49.834
Kid #2:
Use that empty plastic jar,
too.

22:49.834 --> 22:53.967
Elmo:
Okay. So we have
cardboard tubes, string,

22:53.967 --> 22:56.066
and an empty plastic jar.

22:56.066 --> 22:58.066
Let's find out
what crafts we can make

22:58.066 --> 23:00.333
by putting those together.

23:00.333 --> 23:04.734
Oh, ho ho! A horse!
Giddy-up, horsy!

23:04.734 --> 23:06.033
Wow!

23:06.033 --> 23:09.600
Boy, making crafts
is craftastic! Ho ho ho!

23:09.600 --> 23:12.700
And that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:12.700 --> 23:16.633
Ooh! What kind of crafts
does Mr. Noodle like to make?

23:16.633 --> 23:18.100
Oh, let's ask him.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.400
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:21.400 --> 23:24.533

Elmo was wondering

23:26.967 --> 23:30.033
does Mr. Noodle
make crafts?

23:30.033 --> 23:32.000
You do?
Oh. Show us.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.767
Kids:
Yeah! Show us!

23:35.300 --> 23:36.900
Kid:
A train!

23:36.900 --> 23:38.433
He's making
a choo-choo train.

23:38.433 --> 23:39.934
Elmo:
What is Mr. Noodle
going to use

23:39.934 --> 23:42.400
to make the train?

23:42.400 --> 23:47.667
Oh. Shoeboxes covered
in construction paper,
some string,

23:47.667 --> 23:50.600
a paper towel tube,
and a crayon.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.100
Kid:
You're going to draw
the wheels first.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.133
Kid #2:
Not on us, Mr. Noodle.

23:57.133 --> 23:59.133
On the train boxes!

23:59.133 --> 24:00.433
Elmo:
Silly.

24:00.433 --> 24:02.400
Oh, what's he doing?

24:02.400 --> 24:06.667
Oh. Mr. Noodle is drawing
the wheels on the box.

24:06.667 --> 24:09.734
Cool! Very nice.

24:09.734 --> 24:12.900
What's Mr. Noodle
going to do next?

24:12.900 --> 24:15.700
Kid:
He's making the engine.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.667
Kid #2:
He's going to put
the boxes together

24:17.667 --> 24:19.667
with string!

24:19.667 --> 24:21.467
Uh-oh! He's all tangled.

24:21.467 --> 24:22.600
Elmo: Uh-oh.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.100
