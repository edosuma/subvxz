WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:05.995
Crichton (groaning ):
Why is it always my fault?

00:06.090 --> 00:08.797
It's not always your fault.
Just almost always your fault.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.422
Now, give that amniox a bit
of a twist, will you?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.503
Not that far.
Only about half as much.

00:13.598 --> 00:18.592
(both groaning)

00:18.686 --> 00:23.555
You know, Pilot said that this
blockage was a byproduct of
Moya's pregnancy.

00:23.649 --> 00:27.187
It was probably caused by you
firing that chemical-burning
Earth pod

00:27.278 --> 00:28.939
in the transport hangar.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.692
Well, you don't have to worry
about that. That was the
last of my fuel.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.989
I'm totally dependent on
your technology now.

00:34.076 --> 00:37.239
It's not my technology.
it's Leviathan technology.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.867
D'argo, I don't give a rat's ass
what you want to call it.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.619
It's your end of the universe.
It's your technology.

00:43.753 --> 00:46.290
Sure as hell ain't mine.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.166
(groaning)

00:51.260 --> 00:53.637
John, is something wrong?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.427
Yep. I'm fed up.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.300
"Fed up"?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.053
I'm sorry, is this going to
be another translator
microbe hiccup?

01:00.144 --> 01:01.475
"Oh, John, you're fed up.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.553
Does that mean that you've had
too many food cubes today?"

01:03.648 --> 01:08.563
It was cute, it was vaguely,
vaguely amusing the first
siX billion times.

01:08.653 --> 01:10.769
Something clearly is
troubling you, John.

01:10.863 --> 01:11.773
Perhaps I can...

01:11.864 --> 01:14.241
So, what, you're going to help?

01:14.325 --> 01:15.189
Is that it?

01:15.284 --> 01:18.401
Maybe, before, when you
were a priest.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.827
But guess what?

01:19.914 --> 01:21.905
You resigned.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.709
Crichton, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:26.796 --> 01:31.836
I'm going for a drive.
l'm hitting the strip.
I'm going cruising.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.338
What's going on?

01:38.432 --> 01:42.766
I'm getting some space, Aeryn
and I'm not talking about the
space outside the ship.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.936
Look, this is hardly the time
for human nonsense, Crichton.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.730
Oh, God, that is it.
You are so damn smart.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.935
There's no time for any
stupid human anything.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.145
And I'm sick of it, Aeryn.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.605
I'm sick of Napoleon
the Fourteenth,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.406
I'm sick of Blue, I'm sick
of Tentacle Boy

01:57.493 --> 01:58.573
and guess what?

01:58.661 --> 02:00.242
I'm sick of you.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.247
I'm sick of this whole turd-burp
end of the universe.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.073
Crichton, I need you down here.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.580
This backwash is building
up too fast.

02:21.392 --> 02:25.431
Moya is experiencing an extreme
increase in her amnexus systems.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.729
She senses that her fetus
is at risk.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.147
She's decompensating.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.269
Decompensating.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.191
Oh, no. That means
she's going...

02:33.279 --> 02:35.361
Prepare for immediate starburst.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.779
John.

02:40.745 --> 02:42.030
What's he doing?

02:42.121 --> 02:44.203
We must warn him.
Pilot, get him back on board.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.450
No time.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.120
You guys are bugging out on me?!

02:53.215 --> 02:56.048
I hate starbursts.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.939
Oh, God, I am a dead man.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.813
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:18.908 --> 03:22.150
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:22.244 --> 03:25.077
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.452
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:28.542 --> 03:29.327
Help me...

03:29.418 --> 03:30.874
Listen, please.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.043
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:33.130 --> 03:37.248
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:37.343 --> 03:39.459
...doing everything I can...

03:39.553 --> 03:42.044
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.543
Yeah!

05:05.306 --> 05:06.671
Whoo-hoo!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.346
Ha-hal

05:08.934 --> 05:11.516
Yes!

05:11.604 --> 05:14.892
Iwasn't sure who to bet on,
you or the shakloom.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.347
I wasn't sure myself.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.182
(giggling)

05:22.281 --> 05:24.943
You share with me?

05:25.034 --> 05:29.949
ln Acquara, the offering of
food by a man to a woman
signals his fondness for her.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.114
How do you take it?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.333
Boiled or barbecued?

05:43.302 --> 05:44.917
What's that?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.046
It is a map of the sky.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.129
Did you make that?

05:49.225 --> 05:54.094
Yes, by the ancient charts
of the Timbala.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.850
It is a gift for you.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.023
Oh, Lishala, l, uh...

06:08.869 --> 06:10.609
That's beautiful.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.326
Thank you.

06:14.416 --> 06:18.204
l, um... thought you might show
me where your home world is.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.287
My home world?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.255
Well, let's see.

06:27.096 --> 06:32.341
On this map, right about...

06:39.692 --> 06:41.273
there.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.518
Rokon:
Lishala.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.898
Your father demands that you
return to the village.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.276
Is it my father that demands
it or you, Rokon?

06:48.367 --> 06:50.653
When would you ever do
as I demand?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.702
When you learn to ask nicely.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.745
You can teach him that.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.960
| see you took a shakloom.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.167
Too bad.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.718
A baby.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.046
Don't take them smaller
than this.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.722
Right.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.562
This is Lishala'a map
of the sky.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.185
Why did she give it to you?

07:22.276 --> 07:27.066
I guess she thought it might
help me find my way home.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.273
She's never given me
such a gift.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.280
Rokon, you don't need a
map to get home.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.120
You know you'll never go home.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.202
Not from Acquara.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.585
You're probably right.

07:46.675 --> 07:50.964
But this is the first place I've
been that makes me feel I
can live with that.

07:52.389 --> 07:57.884
But the question is, can
Acquara live with you?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.266
The grondeer wants to see you.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.269
Be there at high sun.

08:15.162 --> 08:21.158
So, another green planet in yet
another unnamed system.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.288
Crichton must have landed
somewhere.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.589
Moya's starburst data says that
this planet is on an exact
reverse trajectory.

08:28.676 --> 08:32.760
Along with every other system
we've been through in the last
quarter of a cycle.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.305
D'argo, we have to admit
to ourselves.

08:36.392 --> 08:38.257
Whatever happened to John
is his own doing.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.718
He shouldn't have left Moya
in the time of crisis.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.350
We drove him to it.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.941
All of us.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.111
Have you become so cold?

08:48.195 --> 08:51.187
Cold, perhaps, but also
practical.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.237
We all grow weary of
this search,

08:53.325 --> 08:57.193
and it places us in greater
danger of being discovered by
the Peacekeepers.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.278
I still care about Crichton.

08:59.373 --> 09:03.241
The only reason this search
sti|| drags on is because of the
guilt in your own hearts.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.372
My hearts are private places.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.875
Stay out of them.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.963
Aeryn, you have a voice
in this, too.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.420
Fine. I say we keep looking,
for now.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.521
You know, D'argo,

09:26.608 --> 09:28.860
there will come a time where we
may have to acknowledge

09:28.944 --> 09:32.311
that Crichton has met his
destiny and we're just
not part of it.

09:32.406 --> 09:36.115
Then I will wait for you to tell
me when to abandon the search.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.068
When we abandon Crichton.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.022
Egazéi/‘i

10:16.116 --> 10:17.652
Hyahl Hyahl Hyahl

10:17.743 --> 10:19.904
(mock groaning)

10:19.995 --> 10:22.452
(whispering, giggling)

10:23.415 --> 10:24.655
A-lu-e-masata.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.160
A-lu-e-masata.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.117
Ah, my honored guest
has arrived.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.669
Shai, shai!

10:30.756 --> 10:32.292
Shai! Enough!

10:34.218 --> 10:35.879
A-lu-e-masata.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.176
A-lu-e-masata.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.799
You learn our ways,
John Crichton.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.846
Ah, they're not so different
from my own.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.429
Go.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.890
I want to talk in private.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.273
Come. Sit.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.309
Beside you?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.484
I know.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.528
It's a privilege awarded only
to my best hunters.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.278
lwouldn't wish to
dishonor them.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.907
But by refusing,
you dishonor me.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.248
Come.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.572
Sit.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.334
We have much to discuss.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.583
You see? Not a bad place to sit.

11:17.553 --> 11:21.592
So, you said we have
much to discuss?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.968
Yes.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.720
For instance...

11:25.811 --> 11:29.850
impulsive flights of my
daughter's heart.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.226
You see the way she comes alive
when she looks at you?

11:32.317 --> 11:35.605
When I look at her,
| see a friend.

11:35.696 --> 11:41.157
If it should become more than
that, you need to understand...

11:41.243 --> 11:42.824
Kato-Re.

11:42.911 --> 11:47.154
I deeply appreciate the way your
people have welcomed me,

11:47.249 --> 11:50.241
but I chose to build my home
away from the village

11:50.335 --> 11:54.669
because I do not want to
interfere in your ways.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.082
Amongst our people,

11:58.176 --> 12:03.466
it is the female who chooses
which male she will mate
with for life.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.344
It may be out of your hands,
my dear Crichton.

12:07.603 --> 12:09.184
Huh.

12:15.235 --> 12:20.446
It appears the grondeer has
invited the stranger to
sit beside him.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.818
When was the last time
he invited you?

12:22.910 --> 12:27.495
Only once, when | asked his
permission to attract Lishala.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.574
It is obvious Lishala feels
culleh for the stranger.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.752
And now he sits in your
rightful place.

12:35.839 --> 12:36.954
lam not blind, mother.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.756
Oh, not blind. But perhaps weak?

12:39.843 --> 12:41.299
I am first among the hunters.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.923
As my son, you are more
than any hunter.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.551
You are part of the
Priestan lineage,

12:46.642 --> 12:49.884
and someday you could be
grondeer of Acquara.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.139
I'm seeing to that.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.811
But only if you marry Lishala.

12:53.899 --> 12:57.483
I want to marry her, but
not for your reasons.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.105
How can I control the
way she feels?

12:59.196 --> 13:02.108
I'm talking about rule
of all of this,

13:02.199 --> 13:06.568
and you can't even master the
heart of one foolish girl?

13:06.662 --> 13:09.745
You will do whatever is
necessary to insure

13:09.831 --> 13:13.915
that no one stands between you
and our family's destiny.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.752
Do you understand?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.336
This is the worst Pod landing
leverexpenenced.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.761
Where did you learn to fly?

13:26.848 --> 13:30.261
We lost all power and dropped
the last 20 units.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.968
You're telling me.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.394
Pilot, we're heads-up
on the planet.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.268
We caught a glimpse of
Crichton's module during
our last pass.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.724
I acknowledge, D'argo.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.606
Excellent news. I will
inform the others.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.780
In the meantime, Moya's having
trouble pinpointing your signal.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.279
(signal breaking up):
Can you activate your homing
ident so she can read...

13:48.370 --> 13:49.735
Pilot...

13:49.830 --> 13:51.240
Pilot!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.038
Communication's been terminated.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.208
Another power loss.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.331
Ooh!

14:03.635 --> 14:05.250
Ohh! Ohh!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.210
(yelling)

14:07.889 --> 14:09.140
Oof!

14:09.558 --> 14:10.889
Oh!

14:12.227 --> 14:14.388
Something's draining all power.

14:17.566 --> 14:18.806
D'argo?

14:18.900 --> 14:20.606
Where are you going, hmm?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.776
I insist you wait for me!

14:23.447 --> 14:26.359
(grunting, groaning)

14:31.955 --> 14:33.786
It's a simple matter, Aeryn.

14:33.874 --> 14:37.458
Either you or | jet down there
to try and pick up a visual
where we lost contact.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.752
We didn't lose contact, Zhaan.
Contact was severed.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.751
D'argo confirmed that he
found Crichton's module.

14:43.842 --> 14:44.922
Then he was gone.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.752
Which is why we must
act quickly.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.256
Not without more data.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.134
We're already down one Transport
Pod. Let's not make it two.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.844
They could be hurt or need
medical attention, or even
reinforcements, Aeryn.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.310
You were a lot more agreeable
as a peace-loving priest.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.111
As I assume were you as
a Peacekeeper pilot.

15:07.199 --> 15:11.408
ldidn't give up my calling.
You did.

15:11.495 --> 15:16.114
My personal decision to put
aside the spiritual seek is
none of your business.

15:16.208 --> 15:20.372
I warn you fairly, Aeryn.
Do not go there.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.577
Is that a threat?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.172
I will only tell you once.

15:23.256 --> 15:28.341
There are lines we should
never cross.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.171
Now, I strongly suggest we
concentrate on the problem
athand.

15:32.265 --> 15:37.259
First rule of engagement:
"before you go into battle
know your enemy."

15:37.354 --> 15:40.061
It is not a battle, Aeryn.
It is a rescue.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.480
From what? There should be
some sort of thermal register

15:42.567 --> 15:45.183
from the Pod's propulsion
systems, but there's nothing.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.145
Well, then I suggest we
find out why.

15:48.865 --> 15:49.980
Fine.

15:50.075 --> 15:53.192
Because if we don't,
we're all we have left.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.294
A-lu-e-masata.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.340
Just passing through.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.264
Is there a problem here?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.316
Rokon.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.574
What's the deal?

16:41.585 --> 16:43.291
Damn it! Rokon...

16:43.378 --> 16:47.792
I know you do not mean to be
an enemy, but you interfere
with our ways.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.171
I'm not trying to interfere.
I'm just trying to live
my life, alone.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.343
Then why do you poison
Lishala's heart?

16:53.430 --> 16:56.718
Rokon, you and Lishala,

16:56.808 --> 16:58.594
you've got nothing to worry
about from me.

16:58.685 --> 17:03.224
But I have to be sure I have
nothing to worry about
from Lishala.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.395
You smell like dren.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.266
You look like dren.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.232
Get the hell away from me.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.568
We came back for you.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.571
That's supposed to be
a good thing?

17:58.662 --> 18:01.745
You'd rather those guys have
danced all over your face.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.373
Yeah, I would.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.375
And wherever you came from,
go back.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.439
Rokon:
That's when he came flying in,
swinging his powerful blade.

18:29.526 --> 18:33.735
This... man-creature,

18:33.822 --> 18:36.859
a full samat bigger than
Talio or Ku-mah

18:36.950 --> 18:38.986
with tentacles and tattoos
all over his head.

18:39.077 --> 18:45.448
You see? This stranger, this
Crichton, infects us like
a parasite.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.329
Already, he brings more
evil into our midst.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.753
Remember, our ancestors were
space travelers too.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.922
We are but colonists
here ourselves.

18:54.009 --> 18:59.094
Then you will embrace this
man-creature as you've embraced
the stranger?

18:59.180 --> 19:01.887
Perhaps you will invite him also
to bed with your daughter.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.011
Mother!

19:04.102 --> 19:06.093
You will not dishonor
my daughter.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.347
It's all right.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.181
She knows nothing of my heart,
and less of my sleeping habits.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.687
She should only get
some of her own.

19:14.029 --> 19:16.190
You try the limits of
your rank, Neera.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.863
Remember, you address the
grondeer.

19:18.950 --> 19:25.071
Remember, your office depends
upon the sanction of mine.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.281
Do not show weakness here,
Kato-Re.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.708
Our people will not
stand for it.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.258
( snoring )

19:48.938 --> 19:50.144
( snorting )

19:50.231 --> 19:53.359
Uh-uh-oh-uh-ah...

19:53.443 --> 19:54.808
Crichton, you're alive!

19:56.363 --> 19:58.604
No thanks to you.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.689
Get up. You're outta here.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.241
This isn't the happy reunion
l'd planned on.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.240
ldidn't plan on one at all.
Not after you abandoned me.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.867
Is that what you really
think happened?

20:07.957 --> 20:08.946
You're the one.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.782
Practically sabotaged poor Moya,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.539
then blasted out of there like
a barkan out of Hezmana.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.918
| get a little stressed out and
the second I'm off the ship,

20:17.008 --> 20:19.715
boom! You guys starburst
the hell out of there.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.295
Moya starburst on her own.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.472
You forced her to decompensate
when you failed

20:25.558 --> 20:28.971
to release the pressure on
her amnexus systems.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.394
Do you really think we
abandoned you,

20:31.481 --> 20:36.145
when we spent the last quarter
of a cycle searching for you?

20:36.236 --> 20:40.479
This whole time, the last
three months.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.076
You came back.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.280
To look for me.

20:50.375 --> 20:54.960
A lapse of sound judgment l'll
regret for the rest of my life.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.249
Yeah, you just might.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.049
The rest of your life.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.423
We'll all regret it if we don't
deal with this negative
power vortex.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.176
Rygel:
Which means what, exactly?

21:07.267 --> 21:10.509
If it uses power,
it doesn't work.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.265
Ooh! We're stuck here? Oh!

21:13.356 --> 21:17.725
No power. No comforts.
No defenses.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.069
Sounds like paradise.

21:26.536 --> 21:29.323
( indistinct chanting )

21:29.414 --> 21:30.449
Zhaan.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.031
(chanting continues)

21:37.172 --> 21:39.003
Wake up, Zhaan.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.833
I'm not sleeping, l'm increasing
my work efficiency with a
Delvian wanta chant.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.179
Oh. This might help.
Come and have a look.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.003
Pilot just produced it.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.718
Ah! Good.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.221
It's a topographic bio-print.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.761
Still too generalized, though.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.221
Too generalized for what?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.932
Since Moya can't pick up any
power signals from the planet

21:59.027 --> 22:02.110
she's concentrating instead
on biological markers.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.906
What we need to do is isolate
the most highly developed
organisms.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.983
Oh well, that rules out the
three we're looking for.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.205
Yes, well, even if we can locate
them the problem is,

22:11.289 --> 22:12.244
how do we help them?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.993
I've been thinking about that.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.210
We need some kind of shielded
power source,

22:16.294 --> 22:18.159
something that's hot enough to
run their Transport Pod,

22:18.254 --> 22:20.415
that can be built into
a projectile.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.372
How do we send it in where
we can do most good?

22:22.467 --> 22:25.880
Well, you locate the target
and I'll hit it.

22:38.149 --> 22:41.232
Anyway, thank God I found
this planet.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.275
This system.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.571
You thought you would stay here
the rest of your life.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.400
I haven't stopped thinking that.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.236
Look around, D'argo.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.446
There's a lot worse places.

22:54.541 --> 23:04.462
Since I left my home, I've been
hunted, beaten, locked up,
shanghaied, shot at.

23:04.551 --> 23:11.969
I've had alien creatures in my
face, up my nose, inside my
brain, down my pants...

23:13.184 --> 23:15.345
This is the first time,

23:16.396 --> 23:18.557
the first place,

23:19.691 --> 23:22.398
where I've found peace.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.567
( snoring )

23:34.247 --> 23:35.578
Lishala.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.290
Don't be afraid.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.287
Who are you?

23:40.378 --> 23:42.619
Lishala, this is D'argo.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.705
D'argo, Lishala.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.300
Why did you bring him here?

23:46.384 --> 23:50.218
I... I didn't bring him.
He came on his own.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.420
As a friend.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.800
Rokon accused your friend of
attacking his brothers.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.222
That is a lie.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.016
They ambushed Crichton.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.344
lt's lucky I showed up
when I did.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.976
You've done nothing to harm
us since you came.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.350
Why do they wish to hurt you?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.437
Lishala,

24:09.449 --> 24:11.815
Rokon believes that...

24:11.909 --> 24:14.651
your heart strays my direction.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.906
Perhaps he's right.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.209
No, no. Look, you and |, that's,
uh... that's not a good idea.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.339
You must go to my father at once

24:28.426 --> 24:31.213
and convince him that your
friend D'argo is not a threat.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.761
Come. I'll take you.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.799
D'argo!

24:48.905 --> 24:50.395
This way.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.444
(yelling)

24:58.331 --> 24:59.491
D'argo!

25:00.083 --> 25:01.573
No!

25:01.668 --> 25:03.249
Stop! What are you doing?

25:03.336 --> 25:04.246
Let me go!

25:04.337 --> 25:05.497
Rokon!

25:05.588 --> 25:07.294
Tell them to let me go!

25:07.382 --> 25:09.668
Let me go! Rokon!

25:09.759 --> 25:11.124
Stop it!

25:11.219 --> 25:12.129
She set us up.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.303
Crichton:
No, she didn't! So shut up.

25:16.474 --> 25:19.011
( snoring )

25:23.314 --> 25:24.895
Lishala:
I told you,

25:24.982 --> 25:27.234
they don't mean us any harm!

25:27.318 --> 25:29.183
Why won't you listen to me?

25:29.278 --> 25:30.609
Rokon! Rokon!

25:30.697 --> 25:31.857
Let go of me!

25:31.948 --> 25:33.313
(grunts)

25:49.424 --> 25:51.710
( Rygel grunts softly )

25:55.972 --> 25:57.337
( muffled grunt)

25:59.308 --> 26:03.051
You are charged with the crime
of assault against the personal
guards of the grondeer.

26:03.146 --> 26:06.513
Gracious grondeer, I've always
told you the truth.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.144
This whole thing started when
you asked me to sit beside you.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.601
It made Rokon think that I was
trying to steal Lishala's heart.

26:11.696 --> 26:12.526
That's a lie!

26:12.613 --> 26:14.524
Enough!

26:14.615 --> 26:18.654
My daughter's heart is not
an object to be possessed
or stolen.

26:18.745 --> 26:22.078
She is free to give it
as she chooses.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.450
Try telling him that.

26:23.541 --> 26:26.624
It's the stranger that
disrupts our peace!

26:26.711 --> 26:32.297
And now his ally, this
man-creature, threatens
our very safety.

26:32.383 --> 26:37.127
The crime of assault against my
personal guards carries the
sentence of death.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.597
No!

26:38.681 --> 26:40.182
Please. I know they're
not dangerous.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.927
Please, they're no threat...

26:42.018 --> 26:44.009
Be quiet or be removed!

26:49.150 --> 26:52.893
But since I believe you are
not entirely at fault,

26:52.987 --> 26:57.105
you shall be banished to work
the compound at Lomata-kai for a
period of ten cycles.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.906
Kato-Re, you are wrong.

26:58.993 --> 27:04.113
Grondeer, I remind you,
the law is very explicit.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.698
The law is my domain.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.704
( Rygel gasping )

27:11.214 --> 27:12.704
Seize that!

27:12.799 --> 27:13.959
Kato-Re:
Here!

27:16.677 --> 27:18.759
What do you have in there?

27:22.433 --> 27:23.764
(gasping)

27:23.851 --> 27:25.967
Man:
It is him!

27:26.062 --> 27:27.177
A-lu-e-masata!

27:27.271 --> 27:28.135
It's him. Look.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.847
Man:
A-lu-e-masata!

27:30.942 --> 27:32.978
So glad you could join us,
Your Eminence.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.275
Hmm?

27:36.322 --> 27:39.280
Masata. Masata.

27:39.367 --> 27:47.160
(crowd chanting ):
A-Iu-e-masata...

28:04.267 --> 28:07.304
Rygel:
Crichton, what the
frell is going on?

28:07.395 --> 28:08.851
Ithink...

28:08.938 --> 28:10.428
They think...

28:10.523 --> 28:12.184
you're God.

28:12.984 --> 28:14.349
Rygel:
No.

28:14.443 --> 28:18.903
Not a God, but a sovereign.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.449
Oh, it's perfectly
understandable.

28:31.544 --> 28:37.164
My, uh... um, uh, my empire
included tens of thousands
of planets and species.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.464
This simply must be one of them.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.669
You know, this grondeer's hut
is really quite comfortable.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.719
We are nowhere near Hyneria.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.638
We are in the Uncharted
Territories.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.842
What are your subjects doing
all the way out here?

28:48.936 --> 28:52.849
There's no telling how far
my influence extends.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.098
May we, Your Eminence?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.729
Hmm? May you what?

28:57.820 --> 29:00.937
We're here to bathe you.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.148
( chortling )

29:03.242 --> 29:05.858
Rygel:
You may go.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.660
I'll see to it that no more
harm comes to you.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.034
(chuckling):
Mmm...

29:11.125 --> 29:12.365
5§i=r4-,‘~aa—S‘<i

29:13.544 --> 29:14.374
( chortling )

29:14.462 --> 29:15.542
Tickles.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.214
How's it going?

29:24.305 --> 29:28.799
Well, I've almost finished
with the projectile.

29:28.893 --> 29:31.680
But the shielded power source
is another matter entirely.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.228
I don't know enough of the
necessary science to build it.

29:34.315 --> 29:38.228
Can't believe this, but
I need Crichton.

29:38.319 --> 29:42.187
Well, Moya's isolated bio-prints
of the most complex life-forms.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.317
See this orange marks here.

29:44.408 --> 29:47.070
They indicate habitat.
A settlement, possibly
a village.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.822
And the dark area?

29:48.913 --> 29:52.280
Well, according to Pilot it's
the focal point of negative
power drain.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.741
But look, these three
marks here.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.247
Three distinct life-forms.

29:57.338 --> 29:58.999
Clearly different from
all the others.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.081
Is it possible?

30:01.175 --> 30:03.461
Crichton, D'argo, Rygel.

30:05.346 --> 30:06.836
Well, we know where
to send this,

30:06.931 --> 30:09.172
but I have no shielded power
source to pack on board.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.053
However, we can use it to point
them in the right direction.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.100
Mmmm....

30:17.191 --> 30:19.682
Oh, this is too, too much.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.142
Keep it coming.

30:21.237 --> 30:25.480
Fruit, shakland jerky, oh, ohh!

30:25.574 --> 30:27.485
Excuse me, Your Eminence.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.862
Oh. Shoo-shoo, shoo.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.615
( chortling )

30:34.083 --> 30:35.823
(giggling)

30:35.918 --> 30:38.000
Rygel:
Enter.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.129
Your loyal subjects are
preparing a little
celebration for you.

30:42.216 --> 30:43.376
Excellent.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.298
Where they officially accept
you as their masata

30:45.386 --> 30:47.422
and you fulfill your part
in the Prophesy.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.925
Hmm? Which part of what
Prophesy?

30:50.016 --> 30:52.632
That's what we're trying
to find out.

30:52.727 --> 30:55.309
They don't like talking to
strangers about their religion.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.136
Religion? Dah!

30:57.231 --> 30:59.973
I told you, I'm their Dominar,
not their god.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.932
Well, they don't think so.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.609
They think you're some
kind of savior.

31:03.696 --> 31:04.560
Huh?

31:04.655 --> 31:06.520
Neera:
Your Eminence.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.940
Doesn't anybody knock?

31:09.035 --> 31:11.822
A-lu-e-masata, most humble
masata, forgive me.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.325
Your grand celebration
is being prepared.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.202
Ah, yes, of course.

31:17.293 --> 31:20.877
Where I'm expected to fulfill
my part in the Prophesy.

31:20.963 --> 31:25.957
Now, for my part in the
Prophesy, I shall require
the sacred text.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.258
Neera:
The Timbala?

31:27.344 --> 31:30.086
Yes, yes, the Timbala.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.218
It is written in the
ancient language.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.970
There are very few who
can read it.

31:35.061 --> 31:39.350
Only Priestan, like myself,
and of course, you.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.850
Hmm...

31:42.401 --> 31:45.564
I look forward to the honor of
officiating at the celebration.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.815
(nervous murmur)

31:54.497 --> 31:56.408
How did you know about
the sacred text?

31:56.499 --> 31:59.206
Where were you brought up?
Every religion's got one.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.874
Look, relax.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.794
The answer to this whole masata
thing must be in here somewhere.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.121
Can you read it?

32:05.216 --> 32:06.956
It's in the ancient Hynerian.

32:07.051 --> 32:09.167
I had a coterie of tutors all
through my youth who did nothing

32:09.261 --> 32:11.718
but instruct me in the
ancient language.

32:11.806 --> 32:13.216
Can you read it?

32:13.307 --> 32:14.547
(inhales sharply)

32:14.642 --> 32:16.382
I will try.

33:02.815 --> 33:05.101
Hey.

33:05.192 --> 33:08.104
Are you immortal too,
like the masata?

33:08.195 --> 33:10.402
When were you going to tell me?

33:16.287 --> 33:18.369
I thought we had a
future together.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.655
(sighs)

33:20.749 --> 33:23.411
Lishala...

33:23.502 --> 33:27.165
our futures were never
meant to be one.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.292
Doesn't matter anyway.

33:29.383 --> 33:33.126
Now that he's come, all our
futures are different now.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.801
It is written in the Prophesy.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.380
Lishala, what is the Prophesy?

33:38.225 --> 33:40.341
He's the masata.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.927
Through the Priestan,
he's protected us,

33:43.022 --> 33:47.265
guided us, ruled us throughout
our exile on this planet.

33:47.359 --> 33:51.477
Later, after the celebration
he'll rise up and lead us
to the light.

33:51.572 --> 33:55.531
Wait. You think that Rygel is
going to take you off
this planet?

33:55.618 --> 33:58.951
Whether we want to go or not.

33:59.038 --> 34:04.032
Lishala, Rygel is not a
spiritual being.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.286
He doesn't have any
special powers.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.242
That's not true.

34:07.338 --> 34:09.954
We've worshipped his idol
for generations.

34:10.049 --> 34:15.669
And now he has returned, just as
it's written in the Timbala.

34:15.763 --> 34:19.756
Your Timbala, your beliefs,

34:21.393 --> 34:22.678
they're wrong.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.476
-A flesh and blood Dominar...
-No!

34:24.563 --> 34:26.178
has been presented to you
as some kind of a god.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.265
It's not true.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.021
If he is the real masata,

34:31.111 --> 34:34.239
he'll rise up and lead us
to the light.

34:34.323 --> 34:37.360
If he does not prove himself
the true masata tonight,

34:37.451 --> 34:41.114
he will suffer a torturous death
beyond any other

34:41.205 --> 34:43.412
and so will you.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.787
(ceremonial music playing )

35:32.339 --> 35:36.002
The party's just getting
started. Looks like you're
the guest of honor.

35:37.219 --> 35:40.336
Rygel, you'd better find
something we can use.

35:41.932 --> 35:46.050
The ancestors of these people,
these Acquarans,

35:46.145 --> 35:52.141
they were colonists, sent out
from my empire during the reign
of Rygel the Tenth.

35:52.234 --> 35:56.352
They were meant to expand the
influence of my people's
monarchy.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.438
And they were...

35:59.533 --> 36:02.946
they were abandoned.

36:03.037 --> 36:04.868
Rygel the Tenth sent them here.

36:04.955 --> 36:05.910
Then he...

36:05.998 --> 36:08.034
Rygel, what?

36:08.125 --> 36:13.586
Whatever's causing the power
drain across the planet is
intentional.

36:13.672 --> 36:17.256
There's some sort of device sent
by my empire that purposely

36:17.343 --> 36:22.178
keeps these people on this
planet so that they can't
travel,

36:22.264 --> 36:24.346
can't learn of other cultures.

36:24.433 --> 36:28.301
Can't be anything other than the
blind followers of the
family of Rygel.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.353
What's this about you being
some kind of masata?

36:31.440 --> 36:33.146
A lot of this is new.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.224
The Priestans have made it up.

36:35.319 --> 36:38.311
Elevated my ancestors
and me to gods,

36:38.405 --> 36:40.521
to elevate themselves.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.447
But I must tell them.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.910
Explain.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.370
I'm Rygel the Sixteenth.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.945
They must listen.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.622
Rygel, look at them out there.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.418
They aren't preparing for the
return of a worldly king.

36:54.505 --> 36:57.167
They're preparing for the
return of their savior.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.841
Then we're frelled.

37:02.471 --> 37:05.804
(rhythmic drumming)

37:09.269 --> 37:12.056
(man shouting ceremonial words)

37:54.314 --> 37:57.101
Well akuna matata, masata.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.147
We've got a big problem.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.566
They're all expecting
slug-man here

37:59.653 --> 38:01.359
is going to rise up and lead
them into the light.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.028
We know. It is written in the
Timbala.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.651
Rygel:
It's a metaphor, that's all.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.357
A-a colorful bit of
descriptive language

38:07.453 --> 38:10.786
to infer the guiding of people
to a better way of life.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.864
Listen, Rygel.

38:12.958 --> 38:16.121
To these people it's not
any damn metaphor.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.372
They are burning their
possessions.

38:18.464 --> 38:21.797
D'argo:
They are expecting you to rise
up and part the heavens.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.749
But I... I can't do that.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.420
|... ohh!

38:28.348 --> 38:30.304
No! No wait!

38:30.392 --> 38:32.724
I command you!

38:32.811 --> 38:34.347
(gasps )

38:34.688 --> 38:36.303
Great.

38:41.778 --> 38:45.111
This current bio-print reading
shows all three targeted
life-forms

38:45.199 --> 38:47.235
are very close to the
vortex sight.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.282
Right. Let's drop it right
in their laps.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.031
Programming targeting
coordinates.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.204
Clear to launch.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.206
Now.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.165
She's on optimal trajectory.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.339
If everything goes smoothly we
should have contact in...

39:04.426 --> 39:06.257
(computer beeping )

39:08.222 --> 39:10.087
We've lost her.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.218
It's the power vortex.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.516
No signal, no data, no contact.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.594
She is gone.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.395
So, now all we can do is wait.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.269
And pray for a miracle.

39:39.378 --> 39:44.338
Rygel:
People of Acquara!
Loyal subjects.

39:44.424 --> 39:48.167
In this time of... of... hope,

39:48.262 --> 39:52.130
of, uh of greater understanding,

39:52.224 --> 39:57.685
it is my wish that you will
understand that we have
much to accomplish

39:57.771 --> 40:05.359
together, as a united people
before, um, and, uh...
by my hand

40:05.445 --> 40:11.406
uh... I shall rise up and
lead you to the light.

40:16.331 --> 40:22.122
So, as we embark together on
this great journey forward,

40:22.212 --> 40:25.454
uh, could, uh, take a
very long time.

40:25.549 --> 40:27.164
No!

40:27.259 --> 40:32.219
It is written that the masata
will rise up and lead us
to the light.

40:32.306 --> 40:33.762
Rygel:
But that's just a metaphor.

40:33.849 --> 40:38.843
Uh... uh... and as your leader,
your Dominar,

40:38.937 --> 40:40.643
I command that you
should wait...

40:40.731 --> 40:43.814
Neera:
The sacred Timbala does not
command us to wait!

40:43.900 --> 40:49.486
It states without question,
by the hand of the masata
shall he rise

40:49.573 --> 40:52.440
and lead us to the light.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.071
Rise and lead us to the light.

40:55.162 --> 41:05.003
( all chanting ):
Rise up and lead us
to the light!

41:05.088 --> 41:06.544
Listen!

41:06.632 --> 41:08.293
Listen to me!

41:11.345 --> 41:13.381
I can't!

41:13.472 --> 41:15.588
False god. He's not the masata!

41:15.682 --> 41:17.092
False god!

41:17.184 --> 41:18.594
( all chanting ):
False god!

41:18.685 --> 41:20.186
Ouch.

41:22.314 --> 41:27.399
False god! False god!

41:27.486 --> 41:29.226
But I never was a god!

41:29.321 --> 41:30.561
Seize him!

41:30.656 --> 41:31.486
(gasps )

41:34.201 --> 41:35.941
D'argo:
Crichton...

41:36.036 --> 41:37.116
D'Argo, let me go!

41:37.204 --> 41:38.284
Crichton!

41:38.372 --> 41:40.863
Crichton, help me!

41:43.669 --> 41:47.253
For God's sake, D'argo!
They're going to fry Rygel.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.796
We'll be no help to anyone
if they fry us too.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.419
( projectile whistling )

42:10.570 --> 42:12.356
Okay, I give up. What is it?

42:12.447 --> 42:15.689
It's from Moya.
Thermal storage casing.

42:19.287 --> 42:23.530
Looks like the girls are trying
to send us a message.

42:27.587 --> 42:28.872
That's coordinates.

42:28.964 --> 42:32.957
(drumming and chanting)

42:33.051 --> 42:35.258
Rygel:
You have been wronged!

42:35.345 --> 42:37.552
Horribly wronged by my empire!

42:37.639 --> 42:39.220
I admit that!

42:39.307 --> 42:43.846
But your belief that I am a
god is also wrong!

42:43.937 --> 42:46.223
Let me explain! Please!

42:46.314 --> 42:48.396
Let me explain!

42:48.483 --> 42:50.314
It is how it must be.

42:50.402 --> 42:54.520
No, it is not. Why can't we
decide our own fate?
Make our own rules?

43:00.078 --> 43:01.943
(gasping):
Whaa...

43:02.038 --> 43:03.448
Stop!

43:03.540 --> 43:05.201
(drumming and chanting stop)

43:08.545 --> 43:10.001
(mumbling):
Poor Rygel.

43:17.012 --> 43:18.218
Let him go.

43:19.806 --> 43:21.922
You've been betrayed.

43:22.017 --> 43:23.678
All of you.

43:23.769 --> 43:25.179
You've been forced to live
on this planet

43:25.270 --> 43:27.886
against your will as were your
ancestors before you.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.141
Don't listen to him.

43:29.232 --> 43:31.314
There is a device.

43:33.445 --> 43:37.404
A device which drains all power
sources. It keeps your machinery
from working.

43:37.491 --> 43:39.277
There is no device.

43:39.367 --> 43:42.780
This device sends an invisible
pulse which blankets the entire
planet's surface.

43:42.871 --> 43:43.576
(yells)

43:43.663 --> 43:44.527
No!

43:53.632 --> 44:00.049
When your ancestors first
arrived at this planet their
starships functioned,

44:00.138 --> 44:03.505
as did all the machines
that they left behind.

44:05.519 --> 44:08.682
But you've been lied to.

44:08.772 --> 44:12.481
First by those who left you here
and then by the Priestans.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.307
(crowd murmuring)

44:19.032 --> 44:22.149
You dare attack the Priestans?!

44:22.244 --> 44:23.609
That's the highest sacrilege.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.239
Rygel:
No!

44:25.330 --> 44:29.118
The highest sacrilege is
purposely keeping your
own people ignorant

44:29.209 --> 44:32.372
and subjugated for your
own glorification!

44:32.462 --> 44:34.077
Lies!

44:34.840 --> 44:36.171
You have no proof of anything!

44:36.258 --> 44:37.794
Rygel:
Yes, I have!

44:37.884 --> 44:39.920
In the Timbala.

44:42.222 --> 44:44.679
But only the Priestans
have read it.

44:44.766 --> 44:48.805
If it is true, that would mean
the Priestans have lied to us
for generations.

44:48.895 --> 44:50.305
That cannot be.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.517
Kill him, Rokon.

44:54.317 --> 44:56.182
He's mad, just kill him.

44:56.278 --> 44:57.108
Don't, Rokon.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.776
-Kill him, Rokon.
-Don't!

44:59.573 --> 45:01.734
Kill him, Rokon!

45:03.159 --> 45:06.617
If what you are saying is true
then where is this device?

45:06.705 --> 45:08.161
Where is it?!

45:08.248 --> 45:11.957
I'm not entirely sure Rokon,

45:12.043 --> 45:14.204
but the people from my ship just
sent the coordinates.

45:14.296 --> 45:15.331
Just give me a chance
to find it...

45:15.422 --> 45:16.912
(yells)

45:24.431 --> 45:27.844
"By the hand of the masata shall
he rise up and lead us
to the light!"

45:32.522 --> 45:34.228
Sparky, you're up!

45:34.316 --> 45:35.476
D'argo!

45:38.528 --> 45:40.564
(yelling)

45:40.655 --> 45:41.815
Rygel, the impression!

45:41.907 --> 45:43.147
Your hands! Right there!

46:25.492 --> 46:28.074
Masata.

46:29.371 --> 46:34.957
( all chanting ):
A-lu-e-masata.

46:35.043 --> 46:37.284
No. Cease.

46:37.379 --> 46:39.119
I command it.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.330
I have not risen.

46:41.424 --> 46:43.289
I am not a deity.

46:43.385 --> 46:46.218
I am but a worthy being
like yourselves.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.886
But I am your sovereign.

46:48.974 --> 46:51.010
A-lu-e-masata.

46:51.101 --> 46:53.262
A-lu-e-masata.

46:53.353 --> 46:56.095
A-lu-e-masata.

46:56.189 --> 46:59.181
The slug who would be king.

47:00.276 --> 47:03.109
A-lu-e-masata.

47:15.542 --> 47:18.409
Kato-Re:
| wish you could stay
here with us, Dominar.

47:18.503 --> 47:21.336
Oh, as do |, my friend. As do |.

47:21.423 --> 47:24.130
But I must continue
on my journey.

47:24.217 --> 47:27.459
And if those Peacekeepers I
mentioned should arrive here...

47:27.554 --> 47:29.920
We shall tell them nothing
of your visit.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.175
Provisions for your journey?

47:32.267 --> 47:33.177
Hmm?

47:33.268 --> 47:36.101
Oh, oh, this is so generous.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.220
| wish I had more of
a gift for you.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.648
You've given us the greatest
gift of all, Dominar Rygel.

47:42.736 --> 47:45.603
You've given us our freedom.
Now we can stay in our
beloved Acquara.

47:45.697 --> 47:50.361
And so you do not forget us,

47:50.452 --> 47:51.783
we've prepared you a
special gift.

47:51.870 --> 47:52.985
(gasps )

47:53.079 --> 47:54.535
Shakloom jerky.

47:54.622 --> 47:55.611
Mmmm? Yeah?

47:55.707 --> 47:57.618
( sniffing )

48:00.003 --> 48:01.243
Go on.

48:01.337 --> 48:02.463
Eat it.

48:03.339 --> 48:05.876
(laughing)

48:07.385 --> 48:09.091
You take care of her, Rokon.

48:09.179 --> 48:10.339
|wi||.

48:10.430 --> 48:11.465
Your mother, will she...?

48:11.556 --> 48:13.387
She will survive her
displacement.

48:13.475 --> 48:15.761
You've often said you
love this place.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.093
Why don't you stay and
help us rebuild?

48:19.856 --> 48:21.266
| wish I could.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.099
But my future is with
my own kind.

48:24.194 --> 48:26.526
I'll continue myjourney.

48:26.613 --> 48:27.693
We'll miss you.

48:27.781 --> 48:30.523
D'argo:
Crichton! It's time to go.

48:30.617 --> 48:32.107
Gotta go.

48:39.793 --> 48:42.159
Guess I got some apologies to
make up on the ship.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.630
Zhaan, Aeryn, you.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.796
Forget about that.

48:47.550 --> 48:50.292
Was it worth the trouble, human?

48:51.054 --> 48:52.419
Hah...

48:53.598 --> 48:55.589
What trouble?

48:56.267 --> 48:58.303
Let's hit the road.
