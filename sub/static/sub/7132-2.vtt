00:11.000 --> 00:14.041
Here is to  Pucks!
Big premiere
tomorrow night.

00:14.041 --> 00:15.625
Whoo-hoo!
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Whoo.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.000
He's never
screened a show
at his house before.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.041
That's how much
he believes in this.

00:20.041 --> 00:21.083
I'm not going out
with a guy whose life

00:21.083 --> 00:22.458
centers around
a hockey puck.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.125
It's Matt.

00:24.917 --> 00:25.959
I know.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.166
Hmm.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.500
Jamie Lapidus gave me
a hand-job during
the show last night.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.667
I had to tell you.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.583
That woman is
married to your boss!

00:35.583 --> 00:37.000
Are there no other
women in the world

00:37.000 --> 00:39.291
who aren't the spouses
of people you know?

00:39.291 --> 00:41.208
It's... What?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.166
I've missed this.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.625
So what are you doing
for the birthday?

00:44.625 --> 00:45.792
Oh, birthdays
are no big deal.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.750
Fuck that!
We're gonna celebrate.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.250
Well, I appreciate it,
but I really...

01:49.834 --> 01:51.000
You're leaving?

01:51.709 --> 01:53.208
(SHUSHING)
Go back to sleep.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.875
You're welcome to stay.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.875
Thanks. I'm good.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.125
I should get up with you.
No, no. It's fine.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.333
Close your eyes.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.125
Would you like some juice?

02:16.125 --> 02:17.959
No. Thank you. Really.
You sure?

02:18.333 --> 02:19.709
I'm sure. No juice.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.125
If you're hungry,
I think there's
some cheese.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.959
That's okay.
Am I getting annoying?

02:24.250 --> 02:25.583
Little bit.
I sensed it.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.667
Should we talk about
what happened?

02:32.667 --> 02:34.458
Okay.
Okay.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.917
I had fun.
Me too.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.792
That's it?
Pretty much.

02:44.625 --> 02:46.417
Okay.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.291
Right. Bye.

02:52.542 --> 02:53.792
(DOOR CLOSES)

02:55.917 --> 02:58.625
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.959
Hello, all.
Morning.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.041
Hey. How you doing?
Ooh, the last
breakfast burrito.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.125
Anyone mind?

03:09.125 --> 03:12.166
Go for it, man.
I believe I will.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.333
You're in a good mood.

03:13.709 --> 03:14.959
(HESITATES)

03:21.625 --> 03:23.458
Have...

03:25.333 --> 03:27.792
Have any of you ever had...

03:30.208 --> 03:34.166
an experience
that you'd
fantasized about,

03:35.792 --> 03:41.291
but that you never
believed in reality
could ever happen?

03:41.834 --> 03:44.375
And then,
(LAUGHS)

03:44.375 --> 03:49.417
amazingly,
that experience
actually occurs,

03:51.333 --> 03:54.375
and remarkably,

03:54.375 --> 03:57.667
it's almost exactly
what you'd expected
it would be.

03:58.709 --> 04:03.458
But then you discover
that the experience

04:03.458 --> 04:05.834
meant absolutely nothing.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.709
Nothing!

04:11.458 --> 04:15.083
Which you'd assume
would somehow diminish
the experience,

04:15.083 --> 04:21.208
but instead, the fact
that it meant nothing
makes it even better.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.458
Do you know
what I mean?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.083
You got laid?

04:33.458 --> 04:34.542
Cool.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.458
BEVERLY: Morning!
Where?

04:36.792 --> 04:37.792
What?
What?

04:38.709 --> 04:39.542
What?

04:41.583 --> 04:42.625
Last one.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.834
(PHONE RINGING)

04:55.166 --> 04:56.125
Hello?

04:56.125 --> 04:58.458
Hey. Look out
your window.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.417
What?
Just look out
your window.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.208
Why?
You'll see.
Just do it.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.583
Okay.

05:06.834 --> 05:07.917
I'm looking.

05:08.959 --> 05:09.959
MATT:  You like?

05:09.959 --> 05:11.792
Not really my type.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.583
Bullshit.
You don't think
that's hot?

05:14.542 --> 05:15.583
Are you drunk?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.333
What window
are you looking out?

05:17.333 --> 05:18.959
The window that looks out.

05:18.959 --> 05:21.542
Wait, don't you
face the front?
No.

05:21.542 --> 05:24.250
Seriously? How do you
not have a view?

05:24.250 --> 05:26.250
It's not like the front
faces the Parthenon,

05:26.250 --> 05:27.917
and...
Why are you calling?

05:27.917 --> 05:29.625
Just come outside.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.625
(GRUNTS IN ANNOYANCE)

05:32.625 --> 05:33.667
Huh?

05:39.166 --> 05:40.333
What's this?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.125
I believe it's for you.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.959
So, like,
no sports at all?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.542
You're giving me
a car?

05:48.542 --> 05:49.709
I believe I am.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.208
You're giving me
a car?

05:53.208 --> 05:54.333
Yup.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.625
Why?
'Cause I like you.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.291
You're insane.
People don't give
other people cars.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.500
No one does that.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.250
Which makes you
very special.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.959
Right. Well,
thank you, no.

06:04.959 --> 06:06.500
I'm afraid
my goodwill

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
can't be bought
this easily.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.834
Aw, come on!

06:09.834 --> 06:12.208
You want to keep
driving that
piece of shit rental,

06:12.208 --> 06:13.542
when you could be in...

06:13.875 --> 06:15.166

you can just undo
everything with this?

"Hi, here's a car,

06:20.917 --> 06:22.542
"now forget
I screwed your wife."

06:22.542 --> 06:24.875
No. No. I'm not saying
forget what happened.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.583
I'm just saying
look at this.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.500
(VOCALIZES)

06:32.375 --> 06:34.959
Stop it.
I can't. It does it
automatically

06:34.959 --> 06:36.834
in under
24.8 seconds.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.375
Come on! You gotta
take this car!

06:40.375 --> 06:42.333
I do not.
It's a chick magnet.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.291
I don't want
a chick magnet.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.917
And who still says
chick magnet?

06:46.917 --> 06:49.166
Really?
No one says
chick magnet?

06:49.166 --> 06:50.208
No.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.250
I think we're still
saying it over here.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.208
Well, then
you should all stop.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.750
Okay, look, you have
your integrity.
I respect that.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.208
You know what else
I respect?

07:00.208 --> 07:03.417
A 3.7 liter V6

07:03.417 --> 07:05.542

stability program.

zero to 60 in,
like, six seconds.

Well, I don't care.
No. I'm sorry.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.083
You can keep
your bloody car.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.625
You destroyed
my marriage.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.333
You betrayed
our friendship,
violated my trust.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.917
You do not
get to come back
from that.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.583
You do not.

I've seen it.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.709
Now could you
please move it?
You're in my space.

08:22.709 --> 08:25.166
If this is your space,
this must be your car.

This is my car.
And I'd like to get it
into my space.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.750
It'd be so much easier
if this was your car

08:31.750 --> 08:33.417
because it's already
in your space.

kidding me?

you can have
that one, too.

That's not my car.

Not ever.

We'll see.
We will not see.

I can't believe
you let him
give you a car.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.834
He told me
he was giving
you one, too.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.500

No?

destroyed our lives!

I know. But at least
we're getting cars
out of it.

a little revenge.

your bloody car!"

She's right.
Screw me.
Take the car.

09:31.542 --> 09:34.542
It's not revenge
if he's giving
them to us!

09:34.542 --> 09:35.834
He still has to
pay for them.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.000

nothing to him.

an exaggeration.

that mean?

hurting yourself.

going to keep it?

Nothing.

11:20.333 --> 11:24.000
Absolutely. We always
expected them to
go down in week two.

to see them go
in that direction,

11:55.208 --> 11:57.750
We're so fucked.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.834
I know.
What are we
going to do?

12:00.583 --> 12:02.375
I don't know.
Do we pull it?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.041
And replace it
with what?

12:04.041 --> 12:06.542
I can actually
feel the acid
eating my stomach.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.917
And by the way,
I spoke to Research.

12:08.917 --> 12:14.041
It's not just that
people don't like  Pucks!
The dog show is killing us.

12:14.041 --> 12:18.208
That fucking talking dog.
We had that
cock-sucking dog!

12:18.208 --> 12:19.208
How did we
let it go?

12:19.583 --> 12:22.583
You said, "If anyone
wants to pay for
that piece of shit,

12:22.583 --> 12:24.500
"let them have it."
I said that?

12:25.917 --> 12:26.834
Oh.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.875
Sounds like me.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.250
Wait. One more
piece of good news.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.625
Oh, come on!

12:33.625 --> 12:37.792
Andy Button is suing you
and the network for
wrongful termination.

12:37.792 --> 12:38.875
Who's Andy Button?

12:38.875 --> 12:42.208
Andy Button. Your head of
casting for five years?

12:42.208 --> 12:44.250
His last name
was Button?
Button.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.709
And he's suing us why?

12:45.709 --> 12:47.709
He's claiming
you fired him

12:47.709 --> 12:49.625
because of his
sexual orientation.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.458
I fired him 'cause
he's an idiot.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.458
But I gotta say,
Button?

12:55.417 --> 12:56.583
That is really gay.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.750
If you remember,
you fired him

12:58.750 --> 13:01.667
because he was
the one who liked
the talking dog.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.458
Again with
the fucking dog?

13:03.458 --> 13:06.792
Fine. Legal wants
to sit down with you
next week.

you're always
touching it.

Hey, when you've
only got one,

13:11.125 --> 13:12.834
you like to make sure
it's still there.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.959
So, this thing
with Andy...

13:15.458 --> 13:16.667
Button.
Right.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.041
Maybe I can talk to him
and make it go away.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.125
Can you?
I'll give it a shot.

13:22.542 --> 13:23.834

"Button"?

Is it?

13:42.166 --> 13:43.792

You could be
this color, too.

not to have this lunch.

I'm glad you did.
I miss you.

I'm ordering
everything expensive

taking most of it home.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.250
Go for it.
And I'm not
dropping the suit.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.709
Oh, okay.
So much for chit chat.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.834
Can I ask,
do you really think

14:46.834 --> 14:49.291
he fired you
because you're gay?

14:49.291 --> 14:52.542
I'll just say this,
one person was
fired that day,

14:52.542 --> 14:55.750
and th one person
remembers what everyone
in the room was wearing.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.875
And your lawyer
thinks that's enough
to build a case on?

14:59.208 --> 15:01.542
I have a record
of four instances
where Merc

15:01.542 --> 15:04.208
called me
a cocksucker
in front of witnesses.

15:04.208 --> 15:08.709
That's just Merc.
Come on. He calls
everyone a cocksucker.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.041
He calls me
a cocksucker.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.834
I'm just saying,
the man is
not homophobic.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.417
I wouldn't work for him
if he were.

15:19.417 --> 15:20.959

He's hot.

Oh.

say something?

As your friend?

15:30.125 --> 15:34.750
Don't do this.
You'll get a reputation
for being litigious.

hire me now.

Let me ask you
something.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.125
If I can get Merc
to say yes,

15:48.083 --> 15:49.083
would you come back?

I don't know.
But we need you there.

it got me.

any promises.

get him on board,

16:04.125 --> 16:06.000
would you be
willing to drop this

16:07.458 --> 16:08.834
and come home?

16:10.750 --> 16:12.125
He'd have
to apologize.

Yes.
We do?

Yes.
Is it funny?

Did they?

Oh, shit.
I was making a face.
I figured.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.333
So what's
your opera favor?

any chance you could
present him with the award?

what came over me.

just feeling,
if he could do it...

22:29.125 --> 22:30.834
Is that asking
too much?

22:30.834 --> 22:33.083
I've got something
about an alien.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.375
Fine.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.041
So long as he doesn't
go back to his planet

22:36.041 --> 22:37.333
and move in
with his parents.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.250
Oh.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.125
Oh, my God.
It's called
Beam Me Home.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.417
(SIGHS) Fine.
Let's try this again.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.500
Maybe
I wasn't clear.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.583
I want one
goddamn fresh idea.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.291
Just one.

22:52.083 --> 22:55.959
Yes. Andy.
Button. Go.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.917
What other
animals can talk?

23:27.875 --> 23:28.875
Hey.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.458
So she's delivering
the hand-jobs now?

23:31.458 --> 23:32.542
Very convenient.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.458
No. She came here
to ask me
to present an award

23:35.458 --> 23:36.959
at one of her
charity things.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.417
Right.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.125
I swear. She did not
give me a hand-job.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.750
All right. It did get
a little blowy and fucky,

23:48.750 --> 23:50.333
but totally
hands-free!

23:50.333 --> 23:52.000
Unbelievable.
Aw, come on!

23:52.000 --> 23:53.709
There's nothing
left to say.

23:53.709 --> 23:55.834
The woman's husband
is our boss.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.041
The fate of our show
is in his hands.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.792
She threw herself at me!

23:59.792 --> 24:02.625
Oh, and you couldn't
fend off the brutal,
blind woman?

24:02.625 --> 24:05.709
Hey, it's hard to say no.
But I don't have to
tell you that.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.083
Meaning what?

24:08.750 --> 24:10.792
Al the camera guy

24:11.583 --> 24:14.625
saw you making out
with Morning in the
parking lot last week.

24:15.083 --> 24:16.750
That... I...

24:16.750 --> 24:18.542
Mmm? Yes?

24:18.542 --> 24:21.375
That... I...
That's completely different.

24:21.375 --> 24:24.083
What I may or
may not have done
with Morning

24:24.083 --> 24:25.500
does not put our show
in jeopardy.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.667
Right. 'Cause you boning
one of your stars
is good for the show.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.792
That always
works out well.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.792
First of all, I never
said that we boned.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.083
Did you?

24:36.083 --> 24:39.458
(WHOOPS)
Finally! England scores!

24:39.875 --> 24:41.583
I'd say
that deserves a car.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.417
Have you been
walking around with
those in your pocket,

24:45.417 --> 24:46.458
just waiting
to do that?

24:47.000 --> 24:50.667
Maybe.
Well, for the last time,
keep your bloody car.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.250
Oh, come on!

24:52.250 --> 24:53.625
This is the only time
in your life

24:53.625 --> 24:55.041
when someone's
gonna actually

24:55.041 --> 24:57.500
give you a car.
A car.

24:57.917 --> 25:00.917
Take the goddamn car.
Don't be an asshole.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.375
Have you
been practicing?

25:03.500 --> 25:07.667
Listen to me.
No car. Forget it.

25:07.959 --> 25:10.458
You don't get
to win this time.

25:13.834 --> 25:16.000
You think this is
about winning?

25:18.750 --> 25:21.000
I don't care if you
take the fucking car.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.375
Maybe you
haven't noticed,

25:22.375 --> 25:24.166
I don't like
a lot of people,

25:24.166 --> 25:25.792
I don't trust
a lot of people.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.458
So when I meet someone
that I actually want to
hang out with,

25:28.458 --> 25:31.000
it really pisses me off
when I screw it up.

25:33.208 --> 25:35.333
I hate what
happened with us.

25:35.792 --> 25:38.083
So I'm trying to
do what I can to
make it right.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.000
This is
the best I got.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.500
An Infiniti?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.542
What, you want
a Bentley?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.583
It's not like
I fucking killed
your wife.

25:50.375 --> 25:51.625
I'm never going
to forgive you.

25:51.625 --> 25:52.542
Okay.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.750
I will never get past
what happened.

25:55.208 --> 25:56.333
I get that.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.500
I just want you
to know
how sorry I am.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.500
And that I have
learned my lesson.

26:03.250 --> 26:06.375
And the fact that
you're screwing someone
else's wife now...

26:06.375 --> 26:07.709
But I'm not
screwing yours.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.583
That was the lesson.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.000
God.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.083
(CHUCKLES)

26:16.875 --> 26:19.125
What's the likelihood
of this ending in a hug?

26:19.125 --> 26:20.875
Very, very slim.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.500
How about I hug you
and you just stand there.

26:39.667 --> 26:40.709
(SIGHS)

27:12.291 --> 27:13.834
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING ON TV)

27:13.834 --> 27:16.250
MAN ON TV:  You're a dog,
why are you even
talking to my accountant?

27:17.125 --> 27:19.500
TALKING DOG:  Yeah, well,
see if you're
still saying that

27:19.500 --> 27:21.250
after you get your refund.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.208
No offense, but I'm not
that comfortable taking
financial advice

27:25.208 --> 27:27.834
from someone who licks
other dogs' asses.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.750
I can't help it!
They're delicious.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.625
Here, try one.

27:34.125 --> 27:37.333
Get that out of my face.
Get it out of my face!
Get it out!

27:37.333 --> 27:38.500
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
