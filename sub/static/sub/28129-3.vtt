00:28.600 --> 00:30.034
This is Faith.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.039
This is Ty, and Maxi...

00:32.159 --> 00:34.152
and Ty's friend Henry -
Henry's sleeping over.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
Hello!

00:36.800 --> 00:38.837
Oh, that's Snoopy.
You're OK with dogs, aren't you?

00:38.880 --> 00:40.394
I love them.
- Oh, good.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.399
You're in the way...
- Official bedtime is ten

00:43.440 --> 00:45.591
but it's Friday, so...
- Five in the morning.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.471
Yep.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.113
You can give them half an hour leeway.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.721
If you're not tearing your hair out by then.
- I won't be.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.755
If you wanted to go for drinks
after the opera...

00:54.800 --> 00:56.280
Oh, no drinks.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.117
Erm, my number's there on the fridge.
And this is Simone.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.592
I'm making a butterscotch Angel Delight

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
with a peach garnish.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.350
Would you like an ice water?
- Oh, God.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.431
I'd love one, thank you.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.395
Would you like one, Mum?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.473
OK, but only one more.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.753
Cold water makes the baby kick.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.995
Oh!

01:21.880 --> 01:24.156
Don't feel obliged.
- No, I'd love to.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.591
That's my little sister.
- Ooh!

01:46.800 --> 01:47.711
<i>How about this one?</i>

01:47.760 --> 01:49.416
- Don't like that one.
- It has to be a film

01:49.440 --> 01:51.432
everyone wants to watch.
- What about this one?

01:51.920 --> 01:52.920
Seen it.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.753
Can I go downstairs and get the popcorn?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.639
Course you can.
- Maybe...

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
This one?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.160
Do you guys like kung fu movies?

02:00.600 --> 02:01.829
What are kung fu movies?

02:02.680 --> 02:05.036
OK. How do we put on a DVD?

02:06.920 --> 02:10.550
<i>Similarities to a series of murders
in Scotland have prompted concerns</i>

02:10.600 --> 02:13.991
<i>that multiple so-called
copycat killers are at work in London</i>

02:14.520 --> 02:17.592
<i>but officials have been swift
to quash rumours on social media</i>

02:17.640 --> 02:20.030
<i>about the frenzied nature of the attacks.</i>

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
<i>Police have urged mem...</i>

02:27.240 --> 02:28.240
Maxi?

02:38.760 --> 02:39.760
Maxi?

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
Maxi?

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
Hey...

03:00.720 --> 03:01.720
Hey.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
What's going on?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.760
There's a... there's a spider.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.031
I think he's really scared of you.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.040
And he's gonna run away from you
as fast as he possibly can.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.276
Hey, spider, don't be afraid.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.634
Maxi's not so scary.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.840
Or are you?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.719
Before you say anything, I'm sorry.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.160
I panicked when the wheels locked, and I...

05:15.720 --> 05:17.632
I shouldn't have taken that corner so fast.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.436
And, in an ideal world, I wouldn't have
ended up shooting at all them vehicles.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
You OK?

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
What is it?

05:28.560 --> 05:29.596
He's not moving.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.520
He'll be sleeping.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.958
He's as snug as a bug in a rug in there.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.554
Yeah, we better get a move on.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.394
Got to be at Watford by midnight.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.352
Trucks won't wait
and I don't fancy our chances

05:43.400 --> 05:45.040
of getting through the wall without them.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.033
Something's wrong, Errol.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.874
I know something's wrong.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.720
Are you a doctor? No.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.296
You're nine months pregnant
and you've just been in an accident.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.198
You're freaking out, it's understandable.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.716
Look... you'll be fine.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.194
Alright? The baby's fine.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
Just trust me.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.040
Let's get through that wall.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.957

<i>According to Dad's folder,
the tunnel goes right under the wall.</i>

07:13.160 --> 07:16.119
<i>Originally it was a factory
used to make Spitfires in the 1940s.</i>

07:16.360 --> 07:18.641
They built it underground
so the Germans couldn't bomb it.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.600
Then in the '50s they turned it into
a fall-out shelter for MPs.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.109
Wow. What did they do with it in the '60s?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.158
Nothing. But according to this, they tr...

07:26.200 --> 07:28.440
I'm fucking with you, Roman.
It's really not interesting.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
Oh, right.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.830
If it's underground
and doesn't get any light

07:32.880 --> 07:35.873
won't it be full of creatures?
- They come up at night to hunt.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.709
That's Dad's theory, anyway.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.720
Oh, come on, Mum, we're in tenth place.
We're killing it.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.432
Get ready, the turning's coming up.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
<i>It's on the left.</i>

07:50.840 --> 07:52.911
This race is like the hare and the tortoise.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.072
Actually not about speed,
it's about getting to the end in one piece.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.675
Yeah, except the hare only lost
cos he was a lazy motherfucker.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.151
He'd easily have won
if he hadn't stopped to take a nap.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.896
Feel like you're missing the point
of the story there, Ruby.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.674
Kaye's right, we're hardly
the fastest vehicle left in the race.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.351
Whatever the tortoise did,
we need to do that.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.797
This is a tortoise move. Believe me.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, well, I think it's a stupid move.
- Yeah, well, you've been outvoted.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.235
Wow, that's dark...

09:09.920 --> 09:10.920
Maybe not.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.436
I kinda like it...

10:03.960 --> 10:05.080
That's Clarence.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.960
He's gonna get us through the wall.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.200
You get out here.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.440
Go on.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
OK.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.840
You must be Faith.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
And Errol Junior.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.635
We're still debating the name.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
I'm Clarence.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.952
And I haven't seen this guy in six years.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.416
It's good to see you.
- How you doing?

10:46.440 --> 10:47.271
Good.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.914
Aw!
- Long time no see.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.556
OK, er, get in the back,
make yourselves comfortable

10:51.640 --> 10:53.120
and we'll get you through the wall.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.311
Yeah, yeah, change of plan, er...

10:56.880 --> 10:58.917
We don't get in the back
and I drive the truck.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.239
Ah, look, the sentries know my face.
I go through that gate every night.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.280
Exactly.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.196
So they've stopped looking.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
Errol...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.310
Look, just don't take this
the wrong way, right?

11:13.560 --> 11:15.756
But we're taking a big risk here.
- Yeah.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.475
And you're asking big money.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.392
So you know my car's full of cash.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.360
How do I know you're not gonna drive us
to some fucking warehouse

11:23.400 --> 11:25.437
and kill us for it, eh? How do I know that?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
Alright, OK.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.516
Just, erm...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.437
please, not her.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.671
Why? Because I'm a woman?

11:35.160 --> 11:35.991
Fuck off.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.197
D'you know how many
female truck drivers we've got?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.240
They won't notice.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.953
She's nine months pregnant.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.154
It's fine. I'll go in the back.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.953
You drive my rig, put her in the back,
I'll ride with Johnny.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
Yeah, alright.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.880
Can you just give us a minute, please?

11:58.240 --> 11:59.240
Right.
- Cheers.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
What's the problem?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.640
There's no problem.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.477
But, erm...
I know you're feeling a bit nervous

12:12.000 --> 12:14.117
about the baby, so...

12:16.120 --> 12:17.554
Just, just follow me. Come on.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.310
Most vehicles aren't allowed
out of the city at night.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.158
Just, er, certain types of cargo.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.600
Heading for some research facility.
- What's in there, Errol?

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
What's in the boxes?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
No way.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.553
No fucking way.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.736
I didn't want to say anything before

12:42.760 --> 12:44.592
because I know this is difficult for you.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.598
But it's only till we get to the other side
of the wall, 15 minutes max.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.637
Just, er... just don't turn round, OK?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
You can do it.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.033
Look at me. Look at me.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.440
You can do it.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.433
Don't turn around. Won't be long.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Fuck.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.576
- These guys are cool!
- I could if I tried.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.034
That is a cool move!

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
I could do that.

13:44.920 --> 13:45.956
You do kung fu?

13:46.520 --> 13:47.351
Bang!

13:47.520 --> 13:49.591
Who do you think's gonna win?
- Er, he's gonna win.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.673
Come on, Maxi,
you always let the dog out.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.760
Fine.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.479
Maxi, you're in the way.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
Snoopy?

14:16.600 --> 14:18.717
You alright, Maxi?

14:32.080 --> 14:32.911
You OK?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.753
What if there's a monster out there?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
See?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.918
No monsters.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.074
Snoopy! Here, boy!

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
Snoopy?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.952
I've got a fun game we can play
called "Empty House".

15:28.160 --> 15:29.355
We turn off all the lights...

15:30.200 --> 15:31.680
and hide in the basement

15:32.320 --> 15:34.596
and be really quiet like no one's here.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
Why?

15:39.280 --> 15:41.476
To play a joke on your parents.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.877
They'll be like, "Oh, my God,
where are our kids?"

15:44.240 --> 15:46.118
And then we jump out and shout, "Surprise!"

15:47.800 --> 15:49.120
I don't like the basement.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.476
It'll be cosy.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.239
You can eat as many snacks as you want.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.272
Dad has chocolate with alcohol in them.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.716
We're not allowed those.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.430
What about Snoopy?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.593
Snoopy's fine, I promise.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.720
I want to get Snoopy.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.600
Just stay here for now.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.271
Mwah!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.559
Maxi...

16:31.200 --> 16:32.634
Maxi's gone to get Snoopy.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Maxi?

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
Maxi?

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
Maxi?

17:01.600 --> 17:02.670
Are you OK?

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
What happened?

17:07.240 --> 17:08.515
Did Snoopy bite you?

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
OK.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.040
OK.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.272
All we need to do is type in the code
and the gate should just swing open.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.557
Could this place be any creepier?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
I take it back.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.672
It's definitely creepier with the lights off.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.591
Some kind of power drain. Shit!

18:24.040 --> 18:25.076
I've got an idea.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.550
They needed to keep on working
during air raids in the war

18:27.600 --> 18:29.796
so it stands to reason
they'd have a back-up generator.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.600
D'you reckon you can get it started?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
No reason why not.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.976
But as soon as the power's back up,
you need to get that gate open

18:36.000 --> 18:37.275
and make sure it stays open.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.352
Yeah. We'll figure out a way.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
Fuck's sake...

19:07.520 --> 19:08.816
<i>What's wrong with Maxi?</i>

19:08.840 --> 19:11.376
- It's just a scratch, he'll be OK.
- I think he needs a plaster.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.560
I'll get him one in a minute.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.314
Right now, we need to be very quiet, OK?

19:18.800 --> 19:21.269
I'm just gonna go upstairs for a minute.
- Why?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.511
I'm gonna be back soon.
You guys stay here, alright?

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
It's OK.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.834
Ty, I'm gonna need you to lock the door
behind me, alright?

19:27.920 --> 19:28.751
OK.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.320
Maxi?

19:31.440 --> 19:32.271
Are you OK?

19:32.320 --> 19:33.320
Lock the door.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.920
Lock it, lock it, lock it.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
Maxi?

20:03.480 --> 20:04.480
Police.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.120
I think there's someone
at the bottom of the garden.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.136
Listen, we're right by
where all those murders took place

20:11.160 --> 20:12.760
and I need someone
to come over here now.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.400
I thought Dad said
there weren't gonna be any mooks down here.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.216
I think it's fair to say Dad
probably wasn't the best person

20:55.240 --> 20:57.936
at predicting their behaviour patterns.
- We're not supposed to be here.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.872
No, this is definitely right. Look.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.996
No, we're not supposed to be here.
- Mum, we can't go back.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Alright?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.030
We just can't.

21:10.920 --> 21:11.920
I'm sorry.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.031
Roman's right.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.799
We are where we are.
It's no one's fault.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.680
But what we've got to do is focus
on what's in front of us

21:19.720 --> 21:22.792
and right now, that's finding
this generator thing and getting it to work.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.234
We can do that, can't we, Roman?

21:26.320 --> 21:27.320
Sure.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.358
No. What if you got lost?

21:30.880 --> 21:33.200
What if you got bitten
and turned into one of those things?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.394
No. No one gets out.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Someone has to.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.112
Not you, Zane.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.878
Seriously. I got this.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.160
Shit...

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
We've got company.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.560
It's heading this way.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.200
You reckon that's gonna work down here?
- One way to find out.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.000
This is Team 21 to Team 11.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
Come in, over.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.150
Team 21 to Team 11...

22:40.760 --> 22:43.000
Twenty metres.
You got a mesh pulse on this thing, right?

22:43.040 --> 22:44.040
It's charging.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
Ten metres.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.550
I can't see anything.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.196
Five metres.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
Shit!

22:57.280 --> 22:58.316
Jesus!

22:58.480 --> 22:59.516
What the fuck?

23:00.160 --> 23:01.276
It's on the roof.
- Zap it!

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
Did we get it?

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Dunno.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.640
Hit it again!

23:23.120 --> 23:24.793
It takes 30 seconds to recharge.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.429
Are you kidding?

23:35.880 --> 23:36.880
Kaye?

23:37.920 --> 23:40.276
Come on, come on!

24:02.200 --> 24:04.192
Careful, careful. It's only stunned.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
Soon fix that.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
Rubes?

24:11.880 --> 24:12.880
Rubes!

25:31.920 --> 25:32.920
Mum?

25:36.560 --> 25:38.119
Stay away from my son.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.597
Get back to the car!

25:42.880 --> 25:44.553
Go!

25:48.400 --> 25:50.232
Get back to the car!
- I can't just leave you!

25:50.280 --> 25:51.396
Go!

25:51.440 --> 25:52.590
Oh, fuck!

26:04.680 --> 26:06.114
Ah. The kid came through.

26:07.880 --> 26:08.880
Back in a minute.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.160
This, um...

26:11.760 --> 26:13.877
This stuff's good for your skin, apparently.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.440
You reckon?

26:15.560 --> 26:16.640
Well, that's what they say.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.360
Suits you.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
Where's Mum?

26:37.640 --> 26:39.320
You're still in love with him, aren't you?

26:45.360 --> 26:46.360
Why would you think that?

26:47.640 --> 26:48.756
You know he's lying?

26:54.720 --> 26:57.600
This whole thing about him wanting
to get to the island to save the world

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
it's bullshit.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
I know.

27:04.880 --> 27:05.950
I've known the whole time.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.790
<i>Team 21, this is Team 1... 1...</i>

27:29.960 --> 27:33.032
<i>Team 21, this is Team 11.
We need... We need your help.</i>

27:33.120 --> 27:34.190
<i>We've lost our Mum.</i>

27:41.280 --> 27:42.280
This is Team...

27:44.320 --> 27:45.320
This is Ruby.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.680
What seems to be the problem?

28:02.040 --> 28:05.238
<i>Errol, we're expected at the gate
in ten minutes, we can't stop here.</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:08.672
Keep your hair on.
I'm just getting her a drink.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.640
Hiya.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.671
Here, brought you this. Ice cold.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.640
Thought you were sure.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I am.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.910
But I want you to be too.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.749
This is never gonna work.

28:33.600 --> 28:37.753
We're headed for a maximum security
black ops checkpoint and your big plan

28:38.160 --> 28:39.310
is a fucking hat.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.599
Just trying to keep you both safe.
- He's not moving, Errol.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.873
Well, take a drink. Take the drink.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.040
I don't want it.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.480
- Errol!
- I already know.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.234
We need to keep moving!

28:51.280 --> 28:52.555
Shut the fuck up!

29:02.080 --> 29:03.080
Look, there's, er...

29:04.960 --> 29:06.838
there's something I never told you.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.637
Remember when you first told me
you were pregnant?

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
I knew.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.477
I'd known for weeks.
God knows how, it was like...

29:18.480 --> 29:19.550
ESP or something.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.515
I've had that feeling the whole time
you've been pregnant.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.636
That's why I'm not worried.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.835
I know our baby's alive.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.314
He'll kick.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.040
And when he does...

29:46.920 --> 29:49.480
I want us to vow,
we'll do anything it takes

29:49.520 --> 29:51.273
to keep him safe. OK?

29:52.840 --> 29:53.840
I vow.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I vow.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.720
He'll kick.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
I know he will.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
He'll kick.

30:32.440 --> 30:33.440
Give it time.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.713
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

31:38.040 --> 31:39.040
Please!

31:39.600 --> 31:41.034
- Open the door!
- Police!

31:41.240 --> 31:42.469
Open the door!

31:42.840 --> 31:44.593
Step away from the door!

31:44.880 --> 31:46.633
Please! Help!

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
No!

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Go! Go! Go!

33:07.280 --> 33:08.350
I'm sorry.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.476
Don't come any closer.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.960
It's not safe.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
It got me.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
I've been bitten.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.914
I don't think we've been introduced.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.440
I'm Jenny.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
Ruby.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.596
Are you and Kaye sisters?

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
Yeah.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.835
I can see the resemblance.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.040
Always thought we looked quite different.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.511
And Michael's Kaye's boyfriend?

35:07.880 --> 35:09.200
You noticed their chemistry.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.280
Your children are looking for you.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.400
They're good kids.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.997
But I think I'm gonna stay here.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.357
Yeah, I don't think
they're gonna agree to that.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.035
Would you do something for me?

35:39.040 --> 35:40.040
Mum?

35:43.320 --> 35:44.436
Have you seen our mum?

35:45.160 --> 35:46.480
You need to get back in your car.

35:46.760 --> 35:47.760
Where is she?

35:48.920 --> 35:49.920
She's not coming back.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.912
<i>Team 21.</i>

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
<i>Do you read me?</i>

36:00.120 --> 36:02.635
Team 11. We read you.
The gate's open, where are you?

36:03.080 --> 36:04.520
<i>We'll be with you in a minute.</i>

36:05.520 --> 36:08.035
And we have Ruby. She's OK.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.110
They're just round the next corner.
- Keep driving.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.120
Don't you wanna get out?

36:17.720 --> 36:18.870
Keep driving.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.800
Ruby's with the Volvo lot.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.280
They're coming out now.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.680
Did she, er...

36:28.560 --> 36:30.040
she say anything before she left?

36:32.760 --> 36:33.760
Yeah.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.720
You would have liked it, Michael.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.520
It was all about you.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.954
And why you're really racing.

36:41.720 --> 36:42.720
I'm sorry I lied.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.436
I didn't have any choice.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.080
I'm not going back.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.992
There is no cure.
If there was, they would've found it by now.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.679
You know, I knew you were lying.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.680
But I didn't care.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
You want to know why?

37:04.480 --> 37:07.871
You may think you're not gonna help,
but you are.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.629
Cos I'm gonna make you.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.120
Slow down.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.400
Can you turn your engine off?

37:51.200 --> 37:52.759
Can I see your ID, please?

38:04.480 --> 38:05.675
Step out of the vehicle.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.480
Gonna have to take a look in the back.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.600
Yeah, go right ahead.
Wouldn't recommend it though.

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
Excuse me?

38:15.080 --> 38:16.680
Take a look at the manifest.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.840
Take a look.
I've got a trailer full of mooks.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.800
They're locked up tight,
but I wouldn't get too close if I were you.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.550
Nice wheels.

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
You're racing?

39:23.240 --> 39:24.310
I felt the baby kick.

39:24.360 --> 39:25.360
Don't move!

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
What?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.278
It's alive, Errol.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.389
Our baby's alive.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.109
I thought you looked familiar.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.629
You're Errol Chambers.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.480
The General.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.514
I'm from Cleethorpes,
I've heard every story.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.230
The Brookman's Park Heist.
- Yeah, that were never proven.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.316
It never will be, mate.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.030
Listen, I haven't seen a thing.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.960
- Alright.
- Good luck to you.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.074
You go make Cleethorpes proud.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.160
Yeah. Will do.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.677
And, er, congratulations.
When's the baby due?

40:02.920 --> 40:04.040
Oh, any day now.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.640
- Wow!
- Yeah.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.599
Only you, man.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.120
What do you mean?

40:10.960 --> 40:11.960
"Only me"?

40:12.400 --> 40:15.438
I mean, who else'd do something that ballsy?

40:15.520 --> 40:18.672
What, drive with someone who is pregnant?

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
What's up with that?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.680
They just... they wouldn't have the nerve.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.800
What, they'd be scared?

40:24.480 --> 40:26.153
Scared of what?
- I dunno.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.279
I didn't mean anything by it.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.476
Baby, let's go.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.751
No, it's alright.
You think I'm endangering my baby?

40:31.840 --> 40:33.240
You're taking it the wrong way.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.754
Seriously, mate.
- Yeah?

40:34.840 --> 40:35.876
You're over-reacting.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.559
You don't turn your fucking back on me.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.553
What the fuck, Errol?

40:49.120 --> 40:50.120
Get in the car.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.154
Get in the fucking car!

41:09.720 --> 41:11.074
Fuck!

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
Faith!

43:14.720 --> 43:16.791
Honey, honey, you're right to be pissed.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.080
It's alright.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.640
Why don't you drive for a while?

43:24.400 --> 43:25.470
You're not coming with me.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.760
Baby.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.193
Errol Junior needs a daddy. You need me.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.480
We made a vow.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.353
Whatever it takes to protect our child.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.040
This is what it takes.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.034
You seriously think...

43:42.280 --> 43:43.760
I'd let you steal my child?

43:44.280 --> 43:45.280
I will hunt you down.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.840
HAWAII 5-a THEME TUNE PLAYS

44:34.880 --> 44:37.349
OK, now act really scared, yeah?

44:37.440 --> 44:38.476
Aaaah!

44:39.120 --> 44:41.157
Wait, let me do it again.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.831
I blinked on that.

44:44.120 --> 44:47.431
Oh-kah! Look at this, bruv!
What'd I tell you about my selfie game?
