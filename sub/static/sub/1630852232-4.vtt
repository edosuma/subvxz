If we had just shot this
in the prime of his life,

21:23.689 --> 21:25.103
this would be
a great eating moose,

21:25.172 --> 21:29.068
but this thing basically
rotted to death.

21:29.137 --> 21:30.551
And this is just
too close to our house

21:30.620 --> 21:32.172
to have bears
feeding on a moose,

21:32.241 --> 21:35.068
especially since if a big old
grizzly bear gets on this,

21:35.137 --> 21:37.827
they get really,
really territorial.

BRITTANY: So, what are you
going to do with it?

21:39.793 --> 21:42.965
KALEB: We are gonna
load it in my big sled

21:43.034 --> 21:46.034

far away from here.

Do you want me to shovel?

21:47.344 --> 21:49.206
KALEB: Just shovel
all around this moose,

21:49.275 --> 21:50.448
dig a little bit under his neck

21:50.517 --> 21:52.206
so I can shove a strap
underneath there,

21:52.275 --> 21:55.448
and I'll start shimmying
up these trees with my chains.

21:55.517 --> 21:57.689

want to go climb some trees

a little bit of thinking,

22:02.758 --> 22:03.896
a little bit of planning,

22:03.965 --> 22:05.413
in order to get
this moose in a sled

22:05.482 --> 22:07.724
that I can then haul away whole,

22:07.793 --> 22:11.793

22:11.862 --> 22:13.034
BRITTANY: Oh, yeah.

KALEB: If you'll hand me
the first chain,

22:14.413 --> 22:16.448
so you'll have to untangle 'em.

22:16.517 --> 22:19.586
My plan to lift this moose
and get it into my sled

22:19.655 --> 22:22.689
is to stretch a chain
from two trees

22:22.758 --> 22:26.034
and use that as basically
a lifting pole,

22:26.103 --> 22:29.896
and then hang ratchet straps
down to lift the moose with.

22:29.965 --> 22:31.586
BRITTANY: So,
how does that work?

22:31.655 --> 22:35.103
KALEB: You just pull the handle,
and it tightens things up.

22:35.172 --> 22:38.482
And then we'll have a crosstie
between these two trees.

22:38.551 --> 22:40.862
Then we'll just flip
our straps over the top.

22:40.931 --> 22:42.241
BRITTANY: Nice.

22:42.310 --> 22:43.551
KALEB: I can't really
get any tighter than this,

what it does naturally,

42:42.172 --> 42:43.586
and that is how it should be.

42:43.655 --> 42:45.517
That keeps my homestead safe,

42:45.586 --> 42:50.379
and to me, that is
the number-one priority.

42:50.448 --> 42:51.655
JESSI: Nature is everything.

42:51.724 --> 42:54.758
It is the force of life
out here,

42:54.827 --> 42:56.655
and it's stronger
than I will ever be,

42:56.724 --> 43:00.724
but it is what feeds me,
through my own work.

43:00.793 --> 43:03.827
Everything is a constant
circle of life out here,

43:03.896 --> 43:07.896
and I'm gonna respect it, and
I'm gonna be so grateful for it.

43:07.965 --> 43:10.103
KALEB: Unfortunately,
some people or animals

43:10.172 --> 43:12.758
just don't make it,
and that is part of life.

43:12.827 --> 43:16.724
That is part of how
this world works.

43:16.793 --> 43:19.034
ALEX: Everything in nature's
going in cycles.

43:19.103 --> 43:20.413
A lot of people would say,

43:20.482 --> 43:22.965
"Well, that's just surviving,
I want to thrive."

43:23.034 --> 43:24.896
But I think
surviving is thriving.

43:38.689 --> 43:40.689
Come on! Who is that?

Who is that, Toze?

Hi!

JESSI: Yeah! Hey!

CHRIS: Hey.
Oh, man, I'm whooped.

43:53.620 --> 43:55.275
Check this out, huh?

43:55.344 --> 43:56.551
JESSI: This is
the nicest, newest thing

43:56.620 --> 43:58.103
that's ever arrived.

43:58.172 --> 43:59.655
We're gonna have to do something
special with that thing.

43:59.724 --> 44:01.413
CHRIS: Wow, what a trip.
I'm happy to be home.

44:01.482 --> 44:02.413
Let's get inside.

44:02.482 --> 44:03.448
JESSI: I missed you.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.068
Welcome home.

44:05.137 --> 44:07.827
We are happy to see you.
