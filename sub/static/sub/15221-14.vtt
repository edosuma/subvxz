No, you may not.

Stevie,
guns aren't things to fool around with,
even if they're loaded with blanks.

04:29.902 --> 04:33.133
Aw, Mom! Grandpa T.
had a gun when he was 1 2.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.767
I'll tell you what, uh, Stevie-
T., you've told
enough stories already.

04:36.843 --> 04:41.439
One of these days, I wish
you'd get started on the truth.
But they were true!

04:41.514 --> 04:44.608
Or else they wouldn't have been printed
in that <i>Reader's Digest,</i> would they?

04:44.684 --> 04:48.120
Stevie, not everybody can tell when T.'s
tellin' a story and when he's not.

04:49.188 --> 04:51.884
It's just too bad that fellow
happened to be from <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

I can't.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.478

<i>That's easy, Stevie.</i>

like your granddaddy did.

05:34.434 --> 05:39.565
But he didn't make it up.
D-Did you?
Uh-

05:39.639 --> 05:43.439
Well, I might have maybe
exaggerated a little bit, but-
And the rest he just lied about.

05:43.509 --> 05:48.105
[ Chuckles ]
See, Stevie, you can't believe
everything you hear.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.743
Now, if the town wasn't
makin' money building a hero
for this centennial celebration,

05:52.819 --> 05:55.947
why your granddaddy'd
be over at Mr. East's hotel,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.081
having drinks
and telling stories...

05:58.157 --> 06:00.091
and goin' to sleep
with a glass in his hand,

06:00.159 --> 06:03.617
instead of parading around
in some dime-store outfit,

06:03.696 --> 06:07.188
pretending to be
a gunslinger for a bunch of tourists.

06:07.266 --> 06:11.293
But he wasn't pretending.
He really was one!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.805
You're the one who's a liar.

06:13.873 --> 06:18.139
Now, Stevie, is that the way
your granddaddy told you
to speak to me?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.270
No, sir.

06:21.814 --> 06:25.580
He said never waste your breath
on anyone who's dumber than a mule.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.984
And that any sheriff that fat and slow
wasn't worth gettin' to know,

06:29.055 --> 06:31.114
'cause he'd he dead
before he knew it.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.624

Uh-
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I'll stay out of Mom's sight.</i>

just do what she says, okay?

06:53.846 --> 06:56.440

06:58.050 --> 07:00.041
Okay.

07:00.119 --> 07:03.088
All right. But, listen.
You be careful with this, okay?

07:03.156 --> 07:07.559
You be very careful.
A gun is not a toy,
you know.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.858

Yeah. Ty-

07:45.465 --> 07:47.456
Isn't that a nice name- Coffin.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.468
This place started out
as a robbers' hangout,

07:50.536 --> 07:54.632
and then it took off when-
When they discovered silver
in the mid-1 87 0s.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.971
Hey, you want me to tell you
this stuff or you want to read it?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.677
All right. Back then,
this place was wide open,

08:00.746 --> 08:04.739
<i>and it was controlled</i>
<i>by four vicious gunslingers...</i>

<i>of yours,</i>

We got into a shootout
with the Claggett boys.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.661
Yeah, and you saved the town.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.258
But then, you settled down.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.533
You're the B.M.O.C.,

08:33.078 --> 08:35.274
after a couple of decades
of sponging,

08:35.347 --> 08:39.443
the townsfolk kind of get sick of it,
and your tales get wilder,

08:39.519 --> 08:43.352
and you become a local joke-
the town drunk.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.617
You're weaving your tales
and mooching drinks.

08:45.691 --> 08:49.957

anything more than that,

would cover the rights to your life story.

Well, that's what TV is all about.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.553

- I came on my own.
