WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:09.218
I'm proud to say I lived through
some of the greatest moments

00:09.301 --> 00:12.387
in the history of fashion
throughout my career.

00:12.471 --> 00:15.766
André Leon Talley has been
a staple of the fashion industry

00:15.849 --> 00:17.726
for the last five decades.

00:17.809 --> 00:21.730
Designer Tom Ford has called
him one of the last great fashion editors.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.023
It's beautiful.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.401
When you look
at the world of fashion,

00:27.069 --> 00:30.239
the art of looking at clothes is
about narrative.

00:30.322 --> 00:34.535
Who made them, when they made them,
who wore that, and why did they wear that.

00:34.618 --> 00:39.623
These are my favorite
Gianni Versace metallic trousers.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.167
I'm a very flamboyant person,
but you've known that.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.128
These kind of things make
the narrative of fashion come alive.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.423
Everything is a story
in the history of fashion, basically.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.635
And I have the gift
of listening to those stories.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.720
- Dear André…
- Dear André…

00:53.804 --> 00:54.847
Dear André,

00:55.430 --> 00:59.059
you saw the beauty in me at a time
when I couldn't see it in myself.

00:59.142 --> 01:03.814
My journey into knowing who I am
is one you have inspired greatly.

01:03.897 --> 01:08.235
Anyone can have the possibility
to achieve your dream, whatever it is.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.405
But you must stay focused
and be passionate.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.532
You must never be incurious
about anything,

01:13.615 --> 01:16.577
because the world is full of inspiration.

01:17.703 --> 01:18.704
Dear André…

01:44.646 --> 01:46.732
I grew up
living in my grandmother's house

01:46.815 --> 01:48.525
on Cornell Street in Durham.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.820
I grew up when it was Jim Crow.
We were still segregated.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.823
And that is the childhood that I had.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.452
I went through school
bullied by the boys in my class,

01:58.535 --> 02:00.537
and so I was very isolated.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.583
And then I discovered style
in the Black church.

02:06.418 --> 02:10.172
Everybody in my church
seemed to be beautifully dressed.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.966
And I remember so fondly

02:13.050 --> 02:19.223
that there was a code of dressing
that my grandmother and her nieces had

02:19.306 --> 02:20.557
that was just amazing to me.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.603
They wore the severe navy blue suits
with white blouses,

02:24.686 --> 02:26.563
impeccably done with Argo starch.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.858
Very severe navy blue shoes
with matching bag.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.945
Gloves matching everything.
Handkerchiefs matching everything. Hats.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.365
Wardrobes and wardrobes
and wardrobes of hats.

02:36.448 --> 02:40.202
It was a very distinct style,
but it was not very flashy.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.330
I had an aunt who was
a maid in Washington, DC,

02:43.413 --> 02:46.875
and she worked for a very affluent family
in DC, a white family.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.586
And so she had more exposure to fashion.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.798
So one Easter, she came
and she stepped out of the car

02:52.881 --> 02:55.467
with lavender high-heel stilettos.

02:56.260 --> 03:00.430
Not only did she have lavender stilettos,
she had on a lavender swing coat.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.434
And then she had
an extraordinary lavender handbag.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.354
I just was so mesmerized by Aunt Laveen

03:07.437 --> 03:09.565
and the way she walked
in those high heels.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.234
The coat was swishing and swinging,
left and right.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.112
Her body and attitude
just changed with the heel.

03:16.363 --> 03:21.326
It signaled something to me about style
and about the importance of clothes.

03:21.410 --> 03:25.080
And after that moment, fashion became
very much important in my life.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.835
And so when other people were
playing basketball, I was reading Vogue.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.131
I discovered Vogue
in the Durham public library.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.136
It was my escape,
and so I would just devour Vogue.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.014
I loved all the youthquakes,
the miniskirts.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.100
But also was the--
the Black people in Vogue.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.643
Pat Cleveland in Vogue.

03:46.727 --> 03:51.356
Princess Elizabeth of Toro,
who was from African royalty,

03:51.440 --> 03:52.774
was modeling in Vogue.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.276
This made it so exciting for me.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.070
There were young people in Vogue.
Stephen Burrows.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.488
It was a very democratic Vogue,

03:58.572 --> 04:01.950
because Diana Vreeland was
one of the greatest editors in Vogue

04:02.034 --> 04:03.035
that has ever been.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.912
Style is something you're born with.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.788
It's like class.
You don't acquire it.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.624
It's like class. You don't acquire it.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.418
She was
the editor in chief from '61 to '71.

04:11.502 --> 04:14.129
And she was
this incredible, incredible catalyst

04:14.213 --> 04:16.923
to the world of her time,
the culture of her time.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.257
I knew who Diana really was

04:18.341 --> 04:22.012
because Sally Kirkland of Life magazine
had done an extraordinary profile on her,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.096
huge six-page profile,

04:23.180 --> 04:25.015
and they photographed
Mrs. Vreeland in her office.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.518
Mrs. Vreeland measuring a pearl.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.104
Mrs. Vreeland looking at the layouts
with the white gloves on.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.608
And I just worshipped everything
that Diana Vreeland ever did.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.861
One day, one of my uncles said,
"What are you gonna be when you grow up?"

04:37.945 --> 04:39.780
I said, "A fashion editor."
He said, "What is that?"

04:39.863 --> 04:42.241
I said, "I don't know exactly,
but it's what I want to be."

04:42.324 --> 04:44.284
And he said, "What is that?
Show me what it is."

04:44.368 --> 04:46.995
And I took a-- not a Vogue,
I took a Mademoiselle.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.289
I said, "You have a magazine like this.
You become an editor."

04:49.373 --> 04:50.415
He said, "Men don't do that."

04:50.499 --> 04:52.543
My grandma was cooking, and she said,
"Leave him alone.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.752
He'll do whatever he wants to."

04:54.711 --> 04:57.339
From the beginning,
my grandmother encouraged me.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.883
And that's a great luxury
for a young person.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.427
I was allowed to
be passionate about things.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.721
I always give credit to my grandmother.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.558
She made it possible for me to realize

05:07.641 --> 05:10.477
that the world was big
outside of Durham, North Carolina.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.567
Dear André…

05:17.860 --> 05:21.738
you know what true beauty is,
and you call it out when you see it.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.784
You saw the beauty in me at a time
when I couldn't see it in myself.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.202
My name is Symone Seven,

05:27.286 --> 05:30.205
and I'm a fashion photographer
and content creator.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.335
Growing up, I combined
my love for fashion and research.

05:35.419 --> 05:40.007
I watched fashion shows
and archived my favorite red carpet looks.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.178
From there, my passions evolved
to theater and costume creations.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.013
I even entered competitions.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.348
At the time, my biggest focus was

05:48.432 --> 05:51.059
leaving my hometown
of St. Petersburg, Florida,

05:51.143 --> 05:53.061
and moving to Atlanta.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.148
In 2018, a friend invited me
to a screening

05:56.231 --> 05:58.025
of your groundbreaking documentary,

05:58.108 --> 06:00.068
The Gospel According to André.

06:00.152 --> 06:03.989
It was at the very beginning
of my photography career.

06:04.072 --> 06:08.327
I made it downtown
just in time to find a place in the back.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.704
It was standing room only.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.664
"Tears streamed down my face

06:12.748 --> 06:15.501
as I watched
The Gospel According to André."

06:15.584 --> 06:19.129
When you talked about moving
to Paris and feeling alone in a big city,

06:19.213 --> 06:22.799
that's exactly how I felt
being in Atlanta.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.761
I couldn't believe you felt the same way.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.180
It's like we were kindred spirits.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.933
So much of your story
paralleled with mine.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.895
I didn't feel so alone anymore.
I felt seen.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.023
The film alone
was enough to change my life.

06:38.106 --> 06:41.318
But to my surprise, then you appeared.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.197
You glided onstage
with your golden robe flowing behind you,

06:45.280 --> 06:47.533
and you noticed me right away.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.035
You kept waving
and pointing at me throughout

06:50.118 --> 06:52.037
as if I were your best friend.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.831
Then you called me on stage.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.000
Oh, you're beautiful, let me just say.

06:57.084 --> 07:02.631
And you praised me
for my poise, style, for my beauty,

07:02.714 --> 07:05.425
which was all so overwhelming
and incredible to hear

07:05.509 --> 07:07.803
from one of my biggest inspirations.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.931
But then, you spoke directly to my soul.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.015
You said…

07:12.099 --> 07:14.142
"You need to be
taking photos of yourself."

07:14.893 --> 07:18.438
What you didn't know
is I had been doing that for years

07:18.522 --> 07:20.023
and keeping it to myself.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.025
I didn't think much of them.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.319
I just thought it was me playing dress-up.

07:24.403 --> 07:28.657
"You were my validation
at a time when I felt my lowest."

07:28.740 --> 07:32.119
I knew then
that it was time to take the leap.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.708
I first thought of young children,
especially little Black girls.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.419
I wanted them
to see themselves as royalty,

07:40.502 --> 07:43.755
as classic, and as a standard of beauty.

07:43.839 --> 07:48.552
So I created remixes of myself
to replace traditional queen portraits

07:48.635 --> 07:50.762
and posted them on social media.

07:50.846 --> 07:51.847
My caption was,

07:51.930 --> 07:54.892
"Show this to your daughter
and tell me what she said."

07:54.975 --> 07:58.395
Suddenly, they loved
their dark skin and natural hair

07:58.478 --> 08:00.981
after seeing a princess
that looks like them.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.193
"You helped me to see in myself
the power to create change,

08:04.276 --> 08:06.653
and to fearlessly share that
with the world."

08:06.737 --> 08:08.739
Because you were
my sounding board,

08:08.822 --> 08:12.868
countless people of all ages,
and from all corners of the world,

08:12.951 --> 08:15.078
have the same affirmation you gave me:

08:15.162 --> 08:19.333
that we are beautiful,
seen and magnificent.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.757
I moved to New York City October of '74.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.637
In that moment, in the '70s,
the world of fashion was in New York City.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.097
I'd already gotten my master's degree
from Brown University.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.559
I had a letter of introduction
to the Costume Institute

08:38.644 --> 08:40.729
from the president of Kayser-Roth Hosiery.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.397
That's how I got in the door.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.650
I was one of the interns.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.528
And Diana Vreeland,
she'd been fired from Vogue.

08:47.611 --> 08:51.490
She was now working as Special Consultant
to the Costume Institute.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.867
I did not ever think
I was gonna meet Diana Vreeland.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.119
So that was a dream come true.

08:56.787 --> 09:00.666
My greatest joy in working here
is to go through the closets

09:00.749 --> 09:03.752
and see the magnificence of the fabrics.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.003
She had gone to Hollywood

09:05.087 --> 09:07.464
and discovered these clothes
hanging in warehouses,

09:07.548 --> 09:09.299
and they were just not to be believed.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.636
Lots of beautiful clothes
from Hollywood movies.

09:12.719 --> 09:17.140
Then I got an assignment
that was this costume for Lana Turner.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.892
Some film called The Prodigal.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.019
Metal disks in a swimsuit

09:21.103 --> 09:25.107
that had been dismantled
in a box from Hollywood,

09:25.190 --> 09:28.652
and I took pliers and put it together
because nobody else could.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.821
Mrs. Vreeland walked in the room one day.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.573
She walked past this thing I'd done.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.868
She looked at it.
I stood behind a column and watched her.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.953
She said, "What is your name?" "André."

09:38.036 --> 09:40.581
And she sat down,
and I saw her writing my name very big

09:40.664 --> 09:42.583
with a lead pencil on a yellow legal pad.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.043
Then she stood up and said,
"Now you'll stay by my side."

09:45.127 --> 09:47.171
She had been so impressed
with this costume.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.048
And then she says,

09:50.132 --> 09:55.053
"Now, Mr. Talley, I've decided
you're going to dress Cleopatra."

09:56.597 --> 09:59.016
There's a great gold dress
that Claudette Colbert wore

09:59.099 --> 10:01.393
to play the queen Cleopatra in 1939.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.731
This dress must come to life
based on who Cleopatra is.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.151
And then she says,
"Now, get cracking, righto."

10:09.234 --> 10:11.612
She doesn't say,
"Tell me what are your ideas."

10:11.695 --> 10:16.074
She just says, "Get cracking, righto.
Get out of here. Get it done."

10:16.158 --> 10:17.451
Well, that was an occasion.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.703
You had to act up
and rise up to the occasion.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.623
I went to the technicians
at the museum and I said,

10:22.706 --> 10:26.335
"Could I spray-paint the mannequin
with paint that you all approve,

10:26.418 --> 10:28.378
the color of the gold lamé dress,

10:28.921 --> 10:34.176
to suggest a queen living in Alexandria
in the most beautiful, golden sun?"

10:34.259 --> 10:36.845
Forty-eight hours later,
I had a gold mannequin.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.805
I had the gold lamé dress.

10:38.889 --> 10:43.143
And Mrs. Vreeland walked past
and she said, "This is extraordinary.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.645
This is just marvelous."

10:44.728 --> 10:47.689
And from that moment on,
Mrs. Vreeland and I became close friends.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.694
I had become her favorite volunteer.
I said, "Mrs. Vreeland, I'd love a job."

10:52.778 --> 10:56.406
She says, "We don't have any money to hire
people at the Met. If you stay here"--

10:56.490 --> 10:58.200
She would help me get a job
in the new year.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.952
Then she said, "Do not go home,

11:00.035 --> 11:02.996
because if you go up to North Carolina,
you'll never come back."

11:03.080 --> 11:05.123
I said, "Okay,
I'll stay in New York City."

11:06.708 --> 11:10.504
So, it's Christmas Eve.
I had no money, and I was starving.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.798
So I went to look
in the refrigerator. Nothing.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.966
I looked in the cabinets.

11:14.049 --> 11:18.345
Nothing except a can
of Hershey's liquid chocolate syrup.

11:19.263 --> 11:24.560
So I took a spoon, I opened the can,
and I sat there by myself

11:24.643 --> 11:26.186
and spooned in the chocolate syrup.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.105
That's what I had
for Christmas Eve dinner.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.942
In those moments, I was doubtful
about where I was and what I was doing.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.988
But I know if I had gone home,
I would not have come back.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.740
So I sat there and I just asked myself,

11:38.824 --> 11:42.953
"What are you made of? Do the right thing.
Just stay in New York City."

11:43.745 --> 11:47.374
And after that, it was like
the Red Sea parted. A door opened.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.086
Mrs. Vreeland got me
my first job with Andy Warhol.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.340
Mr. Fred Hughes,
who was Mr. Warhol's business partner,

11:55.424 --> 11:58.927
called me and said, "Would you come see us
at the Factory on Monday?"

12:00.137 --> 12:02.848
The Factory was
where Andy Warhol created his art.

12:04.808 --> 12:09.188
There was a big reception room
at 860 Broadway where you'd go in.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.565
You might meet
Bianca Jagger and Mick having lunch,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.651
or the society fashion designer
Carolina Herrera,

12:14.735 --> 12:17.487
or you might meet
Princess Caroline of Monaco.

12:17.571 --> 12:21.283
You might meet some of the wealthy people
from Europe having their portraits taken.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.202
In the '70s, that was the place to go.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.288
And they hired me for $75 a week.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.957
I had to answer the phones,

12:29.041 --> 12:33.170
take messages for Fran Lebowitz,
for all the contributing editors,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.797
get Andy's lunch from Brownies,
the whole foods store.

12:35.881 --> 12:40.260
I would get him an alfalfa sprout sandwich
on multigrain whole wheat bread,

12:40.344 --> 12:43.180
a piece of pound cake,
and some carrot juice or something.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.516
I got off at six,

12:45.599 --> 12:48.644
but when I got off, I didn't go back
to the YMCA where I was staying.

12:49.228 --> 12:51.563
I was invited
to all the parties Andy had to attend.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.649
I was invited to all the openings.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.069
That was the great thing about Andy.
He treated his workers like family.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.530
I loved working with Andy.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.616
I learned to approach life

13:02.699 --> 13:05.869
looking at it as if you were a child
looking at a kaleidoscope.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.287
He encouraged you in every way.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.498
He would just say, "Gee, André,
you could be anything.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.791
Don't you wanna be a designer?"

13:10.874 --> 13:13.210
"I don't want to be a fashion designer.
I don't want the stress."

13:13.293 --> 13:15.504
"Gee, don't you wanna be a singer?"

13:15.587 --> 13:17.589
"No, Andy.
I don't want to be Michael Jackson."

13:18.590 --> 13:22.219
"Well, come here.
I'm doing some genitalia portraits.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.096
Let me take a picture. I'll give you one."

13:24.179 --> 13:26.014
I said, "Oh, no thank you, Andy. No."

13:26.098 --> 13:27.933
My grandmother would've
had a heart attack.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.897
Then in May in 1975,
I was working for Interview magazine.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.192
And Andy had given me this great interview
to do with Karl Lagerfeld.

13:37.276 --> 13:40.195
Karl had come to New York
to launch his fabulous perfume.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.697
There are no rules.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.031
Everything can be an inspiration.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.701
Inspiration can be in the air…

13:45.784 --> 13:48.161
I had done interviews
before with other designers,

13:48.245 --> 13:50.581
but this was next-level
because it was Karl Lagerfeld,

13:50.664 --> 13:52.958
the up-and-emerging famous designer.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.754
I did my homework and I did my research.
I sat down, and we did the interview.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.007
And I knew he was
interested in the 18th century,

14:00.090 --> 14:02.050
the history of Versailles,
et cetera, et cetera.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.595
And it was very serious,
and I considered myself very professional.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.639
This interview was one of
the great things that happened to me.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.099
And after the interview,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.644
Mr. Lagerfeld looked at me,
and he was very dramatic.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.897
He said, "Come with me, my dear.
Follow me into my room."

14:14.980 --> 14:18.108
And I went. I thought, "Okay,
what he want me in the bedroom for?"

14:18.192 --> 14:22.446
But I went, and I got in the bedroom,
and then he started throwing things at me.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.780
Shirts and scarfs and things.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.491
"Here. Take this.
These will look good on you."

14:26.575 --> 14:29.703
These were all clothes he got tired of,
and he was giving them to me

14:29.786 --> 14:32.789
'cause I was a person making
$75 a week at Interview.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.334
And he was giving me
silk crepe de chine shirts,

14:35.417 --> 14:38.337
custom-made in Paris,
with matching scarfs and mufflers,

14:38.420 --> 14:41.006
which made my wardrobe for New York.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.259
And that's how we became friends.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.346
We started writing letters.
He loved letters. He loved stationery.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.931
There was so much I learned from him.

14:49.014 --> 14:53.101
He could narrate the history
of European style like nobody else could.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.771
He was a great mentor.
He was a great educator.

14:55.854 --> 14:59.066
He taught me
the narrative of describing clothes,

14:59.149 --> 15:01.068
the narrative of looking at clothes.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.154
And we remained great, great friends.
Great friends.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.326
From January till August,
I worked with Andy Warhol.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.662
And from that job,
I got the job at Women's Wear Daily.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.832
So I moved to Paris August of '75.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.670
I went there as an accessories editor.
It was this big fashion newspaper.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.507
And that's how I learned
how to be a serious writer.

15:24.049 --> 15:28.804
I would review Balmain, Dior,
Vionnet, Jacques Fath, all of that stuff.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.181
I had the gift of the written word,

15:31.265 --> 15:35.602
and I learned about the beauty
of the French language and French culture.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.146
When I got to Paris,
people thought I was a natural.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.565
I felt I was at home.

15:40.482 --> 15:46.196
But in 1980, I left Women's Wear Daily
based on some racist comments.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.408
And I revealed it in my documentary.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.369
People have said many bad things about me.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.288
They used to call me Queen Kong.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.124
I was like an ape.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.252
King Kong, Queen Kong.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.337
They were saying
I was a gay ape, Queen Kong.

16:02.421 --> 16:06.592
And that went on,
and I knew this from very close friends.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.887
How offensive, how rude,
and how absolutely incredible

16:09.970 --> 16:11.805
that someone would have that thought!

16:17.728 --> 16:22.441
And I just resigned, and I'd laid up
in bed all day long, depressed.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.902
And then, at a certain point
I thought to myself,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.653
"You need to go back to work."

16:27.154 --> 16:28.822
So I came back to New York.

16:31.325 --> 16:34.286
So that January, I went to go see
Mr. Alexander Liberman,

16:34.369 --> 16:37.664
the late editor and director
of Condé Nast and Vogue.

16:37.748 --> 16:42.878
And he says, "You are a Vogue person.
You need to come to work here for us."

16:42.961 --> 16:45.506
And from there,
Anna Wintour took me under her wings,

16:45.589 --> 16:48.842
and by 1988,
I was named creative director at Vogue.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.680
We have to see clothes.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.683
It's been a very bleak week so far.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.186
It's been bleak street over here
in America.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.480
You know what? It's a famine of beauty.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.692
It's a famine of beauty.
It's a famine of beauty, honey.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.986
My eyes are starving for beauty.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.660
I was the first Black creative director.
That was a pioneer move.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.914
The thing that made that job
so important to me was

17:18.997 --> 17:21.750
it opened the door to others as well.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.502
It set the way
for people like Edward Enninful,

17:24.586 --> 17:26.797
who is now British Vogue's editor.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.174
His work is astonishing and remarkable.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.884
I emailed him this morning
before I came here

17:30.968 --> 17:33.428
about how brilliant his work was
in the last issue.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.180
He says, "You paved the way."

17:35.264 --> 17:38.141
That was the greatest gesture,
and I'm very proud of that.

17:45.399 --> 17:51.822
Dear André, you are the embodiment
of living unapologetically.

17:52.406 --> 17:57.244
My journey into knowing who I am,
making space for myself in this world,

17:57.327 --> 18:00.163
is one that you have inspired greatly.

18:01.206 --> 18:06.170
My name is Daniel Lismore,
and I'm not just an artist.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.339
I am art.

18:14.219 --> 18:19.016
Just like you, I find history,
beauty and art in clothing.

18:19.099 --> 18:24.188
I take couture fabrics, armor, beer cans,
Roman rings, safety pins…

18:24.271 --> 18:27.691
"And create vibrant, opulent,
wearable works of art."

18:28.859 --> 18:32.988
But I don't just create these
to be observed in museums.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.742
I create these pieces
to wear them every day.

18:37.826 --> 18:42.998
I walk the streets,
ride public transport, shop for groceries,

18:43.540 --> 18:46.084
all in these larger-than-life works.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.507
I grew up in a small village in England.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.887
I was raised by my grandparents.
They were antiques dealers. So…

18:56.970 --> 18:57.971
"…from a young age,

18:58.055 --> 19:02.142
I was surrounded by beautiful things
which had historical significance."

19:02.935 --> 19:07.481
I saw through the craft
how beauty could be an expression of art.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.609
I'd dress up in feathers
and bright colors, wear makeup,

19:10.692 --> 19:15.781
and even spread clay over my body,
and get to just be.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.993
That all changed when I entered
the fashion industry as a model.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.497
I had to dress conventionally.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.832
I couldn't wear makeup.

19:28.085 --> 19:33.131
I couldn't talk about my sexuality,
and then there was an issue of my weight.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.803
I developed an eating disorder: bulimia.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.014
I'd binge and purge
back and forth for years.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.058
I'd get too small,

19:43.141 --> 19:46.562
and the modeling industry
would tell me to gain weight.

19:46.645 --> 19:50.357
And once I put on the weight,
I'd have to lose it again.

19:50.941 --> 19:53.861
I was miserable
and losing sight of myself.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.447
That's when I looked to you, André.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.910
As a Black man who defies labels,

20:01.994 --> 20:05.706
there aren't many people who fit
your description in the fashion world.

20:05.789 --> 20:10.043
"I saw you
living unapologetically with joy."

20:10.669 --> 20:16.466
You love life so much, and you were happy
with exactly who you are.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.718
I left the modeling world

20:17.801 --> 20:21.013
and started to develop
my own collection of artifacts

20:21.096 --> 20:25.058
that would later become elements
of my own fashion creations.

20:25.642 --> 20:29.062
I've been subjected
to all types of criticism.

20:29.146 --> 20:32.858
"Rejected, abused,
spat at and threatened."

20:32.941 --> 20:37.321
But none of that has changed my desire
to be unapologetically myself.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.074
"This is the foundation
of my book entitled:

20:41.158 --> 20:44.161
Be Yourself,
Everyone Else is Already Taken."

20:44.244 --> 20:48.040
But I don't mean for it
to just be my book title.

20:48.123 --> 20:52.169
I created it to be a textbook
for the masses of those who get lost

20:52.252 --> 20:54.630
in other people's definitions
of themselves.

20:56.006 --> 21:00.219
My work is about me,
but it's not just about me.

21:00.302 --> 21:04.306
"It's about everyone who is afraid
of being themselves

21:04.389 --> 21:06.767
and everyone who needs to be seen."

21:06.850 --> 21:10.229
Hopefully, young people can
take inspiration from me

21:10.312 --> 21:13.607
the way I've taken inspiration
from you, André.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.323
Once I was out of Vogue,

21:21.406 --> 21:24.493
and working at Vanity Fair
under Graydon Carter,

21:24.576 --> 21:27.496
John Galliano had done
this extraordinary collection at Givenchy.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.874
The dresses were--
Oh, my God, they were just--

21:30.958 --> 21:32.835
I'd never seen dresses like that.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.419
These clothes,
the way he approaches fashion--

21:34.503 --> 21:36.296
It's just not seen. It's the next level.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.007
I suddenly had this dream.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.426
This is like
a Gone with the Wind kind of a situation.

21:41.510 --> 21:45.097
But it would've been not proper to do
a Gone with the Wind show.

21:45.180 --> 21:49.810
It was a nasty, racist film. I said,
"What if we did a satire, a spoof?"

21:49.893 --> 21:54.022
The wind done gone and done turned
the Black folk into the aristocrats,

21:54.106 --> 21:57.860
and the aristocrats then turned into
the indentured servants in the field.

21:58.902 --> 22:01.321
And Scarlett O'Hara will be
Naomi Campbell.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.868
It was that moment that Naomi was
at the height of her fame.

22:05.951 --> 22:08.078
And then we got famous fashion designers

22:08.161 --> 22:10.706
playing the field hands,
the maids, et cetera.

22:10.789 --> 22:15.335
And so we had Manolo Blahnik
as a gardener without shoes.

22:16.003 --> 22:19.464
And Gianfranco Ferre was
Miss Hattie McDaniel.

22:19.965 --> 22:23.719
When he arrived on the set
he came with his own costume.

22:23.802 --> 22:29.474
He made a white piqué apron,
and wrapped his head in an Hermès scarf.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.476
It was amazing.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.146
Naomi had these ball gowns on
from John Galliano,

22:34.229 --> 22:35.522
coming down the stairs.

22:35.606 --> 22:38.901
She's Scarlett as the nouveau riche
woman living in Atlanta.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.112
And let me tell you, it's one of
the greatest moments of my life.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.615
The pictures were critically acclaimed.

22:44.698 --> 22:48.410
The New York Times' Amy Spindler wrote
an extraordinary analysis of this

22:48.493 --> 22:52.039
as one of the greatest things ever
in the history of fashion journalism.

22:52.623 --> 22:54.041
And I was very proud of that.

22:54.124 --> 22:56.668
That was one of
the great moments of my career.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.795
And I started
to think about Mrs. Vreeland.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.174
Those six weeks with Mrs. Vreeland
jump-started my career.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.675
And this all happened

23:03.759 --> 23:06.845
because Diana Vreeland…
believed in who I was.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.640
She was a great mentor.

23:09.723 --> 23:14.019
The greatest thing Mrs. Vreeland taught me
was to stay focused, and research,

23:14.102 --> 23:15.812
and to be passionate about things.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.649
I used to read to her
when she lost her sight.

23:18.732 --> 23:19.775
I would read to her.

23:19.858 --> 23:22.903
I'd go up on the weekends and read to her
long books, magazine articles,

23:22.986 --> 23:24.154
anything she wanted to hear.

23:24.238 --> 23:27.407
And often I would go on Christmas Eve,
and we'd have dinner.

23:27.491 --> 23:30.327
Then I'd read something,
and then I'd stay up till four o'clock.

23:31.078 --> 23:33.539
Diana and I could have
a conversation for four hours

23:33.622 --> 23:34.748
about a pair of shoes.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.543
So that's what mentoring is like for me.

23:37.626 --> 23:41.380
Conversations, giving advice, encouraging.

23:41.880 --> 23:47.761
I realize when you're given opportunities,
you have to give back to the world.

23:47.845 --> 23:49.304
You cannot be selfish.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.557
And so, you have to embrace young people

23:51.640 --> 23:54.560
the way Diana Vreeland embraced me
when I was 27 years old.

23:59.648 --> 24:00.983
Dear André,

24:01.525 --> 24:04.820
you're known
for so many awe-inspiring things

24:04.903 --> 24:08.240
both in the persona you present
and in the legacy you've created.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.995
Even more phenomenal is how you mentor
and nurture young creatives

24:13.078 --> 24:14.246
and help them navigate

24:14.329 --> 24:17.457
the complicated labyrinth
called the fashion industry.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.293
"That is exactly what you've done for me.

24:19.376 --> 24:25.674
You've helped usher me into my identity
as both a creative and an entrepreneur."

24:25.757 --> 24:27.467
My name is LaQuan Smith,

24:27.551 --> 24:30.721
and, as I'm thrilled that you know,
I'm a fashion designer.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.891
I always had a passion for creating.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.852
I'd be sitting in a class as a kid,

24:36.935 --> 24:40.397
drawing figures and designing clothing
instead of taking notes.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.359
The inspiration to utilize my talents
to actually design clothing

24:44.443 --> 24:45.944
came from my grandmother.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.738
We have this in common, André,

24:47.821 --> 24:51.617
as I know your grandmother is
one of your vital inspirations.

24:52.492 --> 24:56.205
I grew up in Queens.
And NYC is the birthplace of hip-hop,

24:56.288 --> 24:58.916
so I adopted
a similar music industry strategy

24:58.999 --> 25:02.002
that old-school rappers used
to generate publicity.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.713
I passed out my famous 3D leggings
as business cards

25:04.796 --> 25:07.049
just like rappers would hand out CDs.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.301
Those 3D leggings were like my demos.

25:10.344 --> 25:11.470
The next thing I knew,

25:11.553 --> 25:15.599
Lady Gaga was wearing my leggings,
and Rihanna was wearing my catsuit.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.560
My clothing was out there in the world,
but no one knew my name.

25:18.644 --> 25:21.813
And I didn't even have a plan
on how to move forward.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.775
But I took my cue from you, André.

25:24.858 --> 25:28.445
I chose to push through the obstacles
and keep my eyes focused on my dreams.

25:28.529 --> 25:30.614
A friend of mine saw my potential

25:30.697 --> 25:33.033
and urged me to put together
a formal collection.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.912
I hustled, I got it together,
and managed to organize a show

25:36.995 --> 25:40.499
in the middle of New York City
Fashion Week back in 2010.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.961
The energy surrounding my show
was enormous.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.213
It all seemed
so overwhelming and exciting.

25:46.296 --> 25:49.633
But little did I know,
you were about to change my life forever.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.970
"You read that article
in the New York Times,

25:53.053 --> 25:55.013
and it's what brought you to my show."

25:55.097 --> 25:59.226
When I heard you were coming,
I was nervous beyond belief.

25:59.309 --> 26:02.688
André Leon Talley was coming to my show?

26:02.771 --> 26:06.400
At the time, I was a New York
underground fashion scene secret,

26:06.483 --> 26:09.194
and an icon was coming
to acknowledge my work.

26:09.862 --> 26:13.407
You stood up at the end
and gave a boisterous applause,

26:13.490 --> 26:15.284
embraced my grandmother,

26:15.367 --> 26:17.369
and organized the models
into a photo shoot,

26:17.452 --> 26:21.456
which became my first editorial feature
in American Vogue.

26:21.540 --> 26:25.460
From there, my life took off
in a way I never would have imagined.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.797
I was immediately thrust into meetings

26:28.881 --> 26:32.634
with fashion editors,
major magazines and celebrities.

26:32.718 --> 26:37.306
So much happened
simply because you, the André Leon Talley,

26:37.389 --> 26:38.932
gave me your stamp of approval.

26:39.016 --> 26:42.436
"You recognized my raw talent
and set the table for me

26:42.519 --> 26:44.563
to be immediately embraced
and celebrated."

26:44.646 --> 26:48.483
You'd always check in with me to see
where I stood with my brand as a business,

26:48.567 --> 26:49.943
visions for the future,

26:50.027 --> 26:53.113
and how I wanted to go about
executing those plans.

26:53.197 --> 26:57.534
My inspiration became my mentor
and then my accountability partner.

26:57.618 --> 27:00.996
Thank you for seeing me
before the rest of the world knew my name.

27:05.834 --> 27:08.837
When you are someone
who's been given the opportunity I have,

27:08.921 --> 27:11.965
I think that you have to try
to leave a legacy.

27:13.425 --> 27:16.637
I recently am doing a master class
with Parsons in Paris.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.057
I've done it all year, and that has been
exceptional, extraordinary, how--

27:20.140 --> 27:23.018
the interactions
between the students and myself.

27:23.519 --> 27:25.562
And the students have been thrilled.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.441
I love the energy that you get
from young people.

27:30.359 --> 27:35.656
You always get such energy and vibrancy
from a young point of view.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.617
When you look at fashion magazines today,

27:38.700 --> 27:41.537
it's flooded with young people
from all over the world.

27:41.620 --> 27:42.829
This is a great thing,

27:42.913 --> 27:45.290
because fashion used to be
dictated from Paris only.

27:45.374 --> 27:47.376
It used to be dictated
by the wealthy, the affluent,

27:47.459 --> 27:50.337
the society ladies, the princesses.
Not anymore.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.799
You bring so much joy into my life,

27:53.882 --> 27:56.552
and I am truly grateful that you exist.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.555
Fashion today is totally free.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.515
You can do whatever you want.

28:01.598 --> 28:05.143
From these beautiful Black girls
standing around in fabulous chic clothes,

28:05.227 --> 28:09.481
to some self-made designer
making patterns out of old newspaper.

28:09.565 --> 28:12.484
Style is about individual attitude.

28:12.568 --> 28:16.154
I took my cue from you, André.
You've helped change my life forever.

28:16.655 --> 28:18.407
Thank you for showing me the way

28:18.490 --> 28:21.785
and for giving me the confidence
to take control of my own legacy.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.288
I only hope to do the same for others.

28:24.371 --> 28:28.166
Each person must find
his own path, their own journey.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.627
Forever gratefully yours, LaQuan Smith.

28:30.711 --> 28:32.921
Sincerely, Daniel Lismore.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.007
Gratefully, Symone Seven.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.802
If you have knowledge
of something, you can create.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.888
You just have to give of yourself,

28:40.971 --> 28:45.559
and then you become part of the destiny
of the world that you have impacted upon.
