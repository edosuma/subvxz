WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:08.666
( theme music playing )

01:54.680 --> 01:56.807
( car engine starts )

02:16.200 --> 02:18.168
DAMN IT.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.736
( grunts )

02:20.840 --> 02:23.707
- ( cracks )
- ( groans )

02:40.160 --> 02:41.855
( Brenda and Nate moaning )

02:41.960 --> 02:44.281
- Nate: I'M GONNA PULL OUT!
- Brenda: NO NO NO! DON'T!

02:44.390 --> 02:46.290
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT.
- IT'S OKAY.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.220
- IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH.
- YOU SURE?

02:48.330 --> 02:50.298
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.494
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
A LITTLE MAN INSIDE ME?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.458
- ( Nate_groaning )
' ( giggles )

02:57.570 --> 03:00.437
- WHOA! WHOA!
- YEAH, TOO MUCH MAN, HUH?

03:00.540 --> 03:02.940
- WE'VE GOT A LI'I'I'LE VISITOR.
-(|aughs)

03:03.050 --> 03:05.143
HELLO, GORGEOUS.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.411
ARE YOU DANCING FOR US?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.909
- I'M DANCING FOR ME.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.454
-(|aughs)
- WHOOPS.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.586
UH, WHY DON'T WE ALL GET
A LITTLE BREAKFAST, HUH?

03:16.860 --> 03:19.693
- RAIN CHECK.
- YEAH.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.220
Radio:
On Saturday,
more than 300,000...

03:24.330 --> 03:26.594
HEY, I NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.504
"STEP-PARENT PETITION"?

03:31.610 --> 03:34.932
YEAH, IF WE GO
THE SURROGATE ROUTE.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.678
THEN AT THE TIME OF BIRTH

03:36.780 --> 03:39.317
THE CHILD'S LEGAL PARENTS
WILL BE ME AND THE SURROGATE.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.217
BUT THEN SHE'LL SIGN
AWAY HER RIGHTS

03:41.320 --> 03:43.914
AND YOU'LL THEN ADOPT
AS CO-PARENT.

03:44.020 --> 03:47.751
I ONLY GET TO BE CO-PARENT?
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.181
WE'LL BOTH BE CO-PARENTS.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.599
IT'S JUST WORDS.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.190
I'VE ALREADY READ
EVERYTHING.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.790
EVERYTHING?

03:55.900 --> 03:58.528
YEAH. I SIGNED YOUR FORM,
NOW YOU NEED TO SIGN MINE.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.734
OKAY.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.009
( sighs )

04:07.110 --> 04:09.135
WE'RE REALLY DOING THIS,
AREN'T WE?

04:09.240 --> 04:11.003
DAVID.

04:11.110 --> 04:14.079
NO, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT,
I KNOW.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.614
OH, I SPOKE TO SHIRLEY
WHAT'S-HER-NAME,

04:16.720 --> 04:19.211
THE ADOPTION COUNSELOR.
IF WE ADOPT,

04:19.320 --> 04:22.084
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO FAX OVER
AN ORIENTATION SCHEDULE.

04:22.190 --> 04:24.454
MORNINGS ARE BETTER
FOR ME.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.620
- NIGHTS ARE BETTER FOR ME.
- OKAY, WE CAN DO NIGHTS.

04:27.730 --> 04:32.292
- I'M SURE ROG
WILL LET ME GO.
- THANK YOU.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.305
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET TO PICK THE NAME.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.231
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M BEING NICE TO YOU
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.229
YOU'RE BEING NICE TO ME
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PICK
THE BABY'S NAME.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.274
THE FACT THAT
JACKSON CHARLES FISHER
IS AN EXCELLENT NAME,

04:45.380 --> 04:47.075
AND PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEES
THAT OUR SON

04:47.180 --> 04:49.683
WILL BE PLAYING THIRD BASE
FOR THE LOS ANGELES DODGERS

04:49.790 --> 04:52.384
IS COMPLETELY
A SEPARATE ISSUE.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.595
LOOK AT YOU,
ALWAYS WORKING.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.419
THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE'S ALWAYS WORK TO DO.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.001
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:13.110 --> 05:15.704
JUST CLEANING A BIT UP HERE.
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES,

05:15.810 --> 05:17.346
OR DISADVANTAGES,
OF BEING TALL

05:17.450 --> 05:19.918
IS YOU CAN SEE DUST
WHERE NO ONE CAN.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.647
THAT WAS MY DRYING TOWEL.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.217
OH.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.515
I'M SORRY. SHOULD I USE
SOMETHING ELSE?

05:25.620 --> 05:27.781
IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.457
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
AT SIXES AND SEVENS
WITH ME ALL DAY.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.324
GEORGE, THE KITCHEN
IS MY TERRITORY.
I HAVE MY WAYS.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.068
SO, WHAT IF I TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE KITCHEN

05:39.170 --> 05:41.889
AND WE WALK DOWN TO THAT
LITTLE ARMENIAN DELI
AND GET A SANDWICH?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.662
- IT'S 10:30 IN THE MORNING!
- ( whispers ) OKAY.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.079
I'LL JUST MAKE MYSELF
A SANDWICH.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.949
DO WE HAVE ANY OF THAT
SPICY MUSTARD I LIKE?

05:54.050 --> 05:57.713
IF WE DO, IT'S IN THE DOOR
WHERE IT ALWAYS IS.

05:59.150 --> 06:03.519
( bottles clinking )

06:03.630 --> 06:06.554
- I DON'T SEE ANY.
- ( sighs )

06:06.660 --> 06:09.128
IF IT'S TOO MUCH
OF AN IMPOSITION TO HELP
YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

06:09.230 --> 06:10.766
THEN I'LL MAKE
MY OWN SANDWICH!

06:10.870 --> 06:14.089
JUST TIP MY CHAIR OVER
SO I CAN CRAWL TO THE BREADBOX!

06:14.200 --> 06:16.532
( shouts )
LET ME DO IT!

06:24.010 --> 06:25.170
RUTH...

06:25.280 --> 06:26.975
I CAN DO IT.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.447
HERE'S A RECENT PHOTO.

06:31.550 --> 06:34.656
HIS SUIT'S BEING CLEANED.
I'LL GET THAT TO YOU
TOMORROW.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.149
YOU WANTED US
TO HANDLE THE MEMORIAL
MARKER AS WELL?

06:37.260 --> 06:39.125
UM, YEAH,
THE POLISHED GRANITE.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.095
I PUT A POST-IT
IN THE CATALOG.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.227
JUST HIS NAME--
"SAMUEL WAYNE HOVIAK.
BELOVED HUSBAND."

06:45.330 --> 06:48.436
- SAM HOVIAK?
- Woman: YEAH.

06:50.740 --> 06:53.436
- DID HE GO
TO BONAVENTURE HIGH?
- YEAH, DID YOU KNOW HIM?

06:53.540 --> 06:56.134
WELL, YEAH.
I KNEW HIM REAL WELL.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.902
- WOW.
- I'M SO SORRY.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.309
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN YEARS.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.184
WE MET IN COLLEGE.
WE WERE BOTH ENGLISH MAJORS.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.679
UH, HOW DID YOU END UP
COMING HERE?

07:07.790 --> 07:10.623
OH, I DRIVE PAST
ALL THE TIME ON THE WAY
TO SAM'S PARENTS.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.995
- STILL ON HARVARD,
THE SAME HOUSE?
- YEAH.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.695
( sighs )

07:17.800 --> 07:20.268
UH, AGAIN,
I AM SO SORRY.

07:20.370 --> 07:24.067
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED PLEASE DON'T HESITATE
TO CALL US DAY OR NIGHT.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.479
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.074
HE WAS A BUDDY
OF YOURS, HUH?

07:32.180 --> 07:34.978
YEAH, YEAH, UM...

07:36.420 --> 07:37.910
ME, HIM AND THIS OTHER GUY

07:38.020 --> 07:40.682
WERE, LIKE, BEST FRIENDS
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

07:40.790 --> 07:41.984
HMM.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.682
( chuckles )

07:43.790 --> 07:45.781
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT TH ESE.

07:45.890 --> 07:49.348
YEAH, I WENT IN A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM
THE LAST SERIES.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.826
- I CAN SEE THAT.
- YEAH.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.037
YEAH, I FELT LIK
I TOOK THE COLLAGE STUFF
AS FAR AS I COULD.

07:58.140 --> 08:01.337
AND WITH THESE
I WAS THINKING LESS
ABOUT THE PROCESS

08:01.440 --> 08:03.476
AND MORE OF JUST ABOUT...

08:03.580 --> 08:06.299
I THINK SIMPLE
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.776
HMM.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.624
- HMM.
- WELL?

08:18.730 --> 08:20.789
THEY'RE QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.427
- OH.
- BUT I CAN'T SELL THEM.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.169
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, CLAIRE, THEY'RE
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHS.

08:27.270 --> 08:30.569
- YEAH, TECHNICALLY, BUT--
- AND THEY'RE BEAUTIFULLY SHOT.

08:30.670 --> 08:33.707
BUT I'M AN ART DEALER,
I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WANT.

08:33.810 --> 08:36.847
AND IT'S NOT PICTURES
FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S WEDDING.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.919
MAYBE IF I TOOK OUT
SOME OF THE ONES

08:40.020 --> 08:42.739
THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY
IT AS A WEDDING.

08:42.850 --> 08:46.013
YOU KNOW, MAKE IT
A LITTLE MORE AMBIGUOUS.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.349
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD?

08:50.460 --> 08:53.623
OH, I WOULD NEVER
ASK YOU TO COMPROMISE
YOUR ARTISTIC VISION.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.153
WELL, I CAN PROBABLY
INTERPRET MY VISION

08:56.260 --> 08:58.091
IN DIFFERENT WAYS,
YOU KNOW?

08:58.200 --> 09:02.159
AND I WAS KIND OF HOPING
TO GET ANOTHER SHOW SOON.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.966
- AH.
- YEAH.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.901
SORRY.

09:11.210 --> 09:15.146
I STILL HAVE
A COUPLE IDEAS FOR
THE COLLAGE SERIES.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.184
YOU KNOW?

09:17.290 --> 09:21.408
ALL RIGHT, I'M HAVING
A GROUP SHOW NEXT MONTH.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.353
IF YOU CAN BRING ME
TWO PIECES

09:24.460 --> 09:26.052
FROM YOUR COLLAGE SERIES

09:26.160 --> 09:28.196
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.097
JUST TWO?

09:30.200 --> 09:33.260
- ( door opens )
- THE WORLD IS AN EVIL
PLACE, CLAIRE.

09:33.370 --> 09:35.235
( door closes )

09:35.340 --> 09:38.366
- NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT?
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:38.470 --> 09:40.700
- ( inhales )
- NO FORMALDEHYDE SMELL.

09:40.810 --> 09:44.246
I'M TRYING
A NEW LINE OF CHEMICALS--
"MILLENNIUM NEW ERA."

09:44.350 --> 09:46.341
LESS TOXIC EXPOSURE

09:46.450 --> 09:48.668
SO I'LL LIVE TO SEE
MY GRANDKIDS.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.316
LOOKS GOOD, RIGHT?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.658
DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.183
- SHOULD I?
- IT'S SAM HOVIAK.

09:58.290 --> 10:01.191
SAM...

10:01.300 --> 10:04.189
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE KIDDING.
SAM HOVIAK FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

10:04.300 --> 10:06.734
MM-HMM.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.207
- WOW, HE GOT FAT.
- YEAH.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.675
I USED TO HAVE
SUCH A CRUSH ON HIM.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.772
- REALLY?
- HE ALWAYS SO NICE TO ME.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.145
AND HE HAD
SUCH GREAT SHOULDERS.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.287
- HE WAS RUN OVER?
- YEAH, HE RAN OVER HIMSELF.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.449
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

10:25.550 --> 10:26.812
I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.059
( cell phone rings )

10:29.160 --> 10:31.628
THE ADOPTION AGENCY.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.997
THIS IS DAVID FISHER.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.762
YES, SHIRLEY.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:37.870 --> 10:40.236
Sam:
NO FUCKING WAY.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.537
YEAH, THAT'S YOU.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.905
JESUS, WHAT A LARDASS.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.331
WELL, I GUESS I ATE
TOO MUCH PUSSY, HUH?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.819
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU USED TO BE SO OBSESSED
WITH YOUR FUCKING SIX-PACK

10:52.920 --> 10:54.808
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SECRETLY GAY.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.343
DUDE, I GOT FAT.
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.851
YOU SWORE YOU'D NEVER BECOME
A FUCKING FUNERAL DIRECTOR
AND LOOK AT YOU NOW.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.451
AT LEAST I DON'T NEED
A GOLF CART TO GET AROUND.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.187
OH, DUDE, HARSH.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.453
BY THE WAY,
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU SLEPT
WITH SHEILA MADDOX

11:08.560 --> 11:10.061
WHILE SHE WAS SUPPOSEDLY
MY GIRLFRIEND.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.990
THE OPERATIVE WORD
THERE IS SUPPOSEDLY.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.739
YOU WERE TOO BUSY
TRYING TO BAG JENNIFER
KAUFMAN TO NOTICE.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.263
- I DID BAG JENNIFER KAUFMAN.
- I KNEW YOU DID.

11:17.370 --> 11:20.077
AND SHEILA KNEW IT TOO.
I WAS MERELY COMFORTING HER.

11:21.510 --> 11:23.068
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

11:23.180 --> 11:25.102
REMEMBER FEELING
LIKE THERE WAS

11:25.210 --> 11:27.519
NOTHING IN THE WORLD
YOU COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH

11:27.620 --> 11:30.111
AND IT WOULD ALWAYS
BE THAT WAY?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.429
DID YOU MAKE A VEGETABLE?

11:45.530 --> 11:48.567
NO, THIS IS
SPINACH LASAGNA.

11:48.670 --> 11:51.309
I FIGURED THAT WOULD
BE OUR VEGETABLE.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.004
WELL, I ONLY ASKED
BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU
MAKE A DISH

11:54.110 --> 11:56.499
AND IT'S NOT UNTIL WE'RE
ALMOST FINISHED EATING

11:56.610 --> 11:58.976
THAT YOU REMEMBER
IT'S STILL IN THE OVEN.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.015
I GUESS I MUST HAVE
ALZHEIMER'S.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.418
I WASN'T BEING CRITICAL,
RUTH.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.250
ACTUALLY, I FIND
ALL YOUR LITTLE QUIRKS
VERY ENDEARING.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.954
HMM.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.483
MMM.
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.195
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT'S IN IT?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.288
DO YOU WANT ME TO LIST
ALL THE INGREDIENTS?

12:18.400 --> 12:21.961
NOT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT THIS SPICE IS?

12:30.850 --> 12:33.512
"ITALIAN SEASONING."
( chuckles )

12:33.620 --> 12:36.248
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
COULD BUY IT ALL MIXED
UP LIKE THIS.

12:36.350 --> 12:39.717
"BASIL, ROSEMARY, MARJORAM,
SAGE, THYME, OREGANO."

12:39.820 --> 12:42.687
( chuckles )
HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN STOCK.

12:42.790 --> 12:45.384
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.462
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL
AN ITALIAN HOOKER?

12:54.540 --> 12:56.167
A PASTA-TUTE

12:57.740 --> 13:00.208
( laughs )

13:00.310 --> 13:03.199
THAT KIND OF HUMOR
DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL
TO ME, GEORGE.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.116
GUESS IT'S NOT
THAT FUNNY.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.176
YOU'RE GODDAMNED RIGHT
IT'S NOT FUNNY!

13:09.280 --> 13:11.885
NONE OF THIS FUNNY!
YOU TRICKED ME INTO
MARRYING YOU!

13:11.990 --> 13:13.617
YOU KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY
AND DIDN'T TELL ME!

13:13.720 --> 13:16.086
AND NOW I HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

13:16.190 --> 13:19.125
WHAT DID I DO
TO FUCKING DESERVE THIS?!

13:23.100 --> 13:25.159
YOU CAN REALLY TASTE
THE ROSEMARY.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.702
Margaret:
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

13:32.810 --> 13:36.598
- YOU DON'T BELONG
IN A PLACE LIKE THAT.
- I HAVE TO DO MY INTERNSHIP.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.507
I'VE GOT TO CLOCK
300 HOURS.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.168
BUT A FREE CLINIC?

13:40.280 --> 13:43.408
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO HIRE AN ARMED ESCORT
TO WALK TO YOUR CAR.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.078
YOU'RE CATASTROPHYSING.

13:45.190 --> 13:47.909
THOSE PLACES ATTRACT
THE ABSOLUTE DREGS
OF SOCIETY.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.523
THE MOST DESPERATE
AND THE MOST DANGEROUS.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.258
THE REASON I CHARGE
$200 AN HOUR

13:53.360 --> 13:55.123
IS TO KEEP THOSE KINDS
OF PEOPLE OUT OF MY OFFICE.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.323
WELL, THANKFULLY
I'M NOT YOU.

13:57.430 --> 14:00.228
YOU KNOW, I WOULD
LIKE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
WHO ACTUALLY NEED HELP.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.104
REALLY, BRENDA, LET ME
FIND YOU A BETTER INTERNSHIP.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.098
ONE THAT'S MORE SUITED
TO YOUR TALENTS.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.531
I HATE TO LET THE FACT
THAT I'VE SLEPT WITH

14:07.640 --> 14:10.438
HALF OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA'S PSYCHIATRIC
ACADEMIA GO TO WASTE.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.302
NO THANK YOU.
I AM FINE.

14:12.410 --> 14:15.072
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP
THEM ANYWAY?

14:15.180 --> 14:17.648
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
DOING COGNITIVE WORK.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.308
YOU LIVE IN YOUR HEAD.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.059
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RELATE
TO CRACK ADDICT S?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.549
BECAUSE I'VE HAD
MY OWN STRUGGLES
WITH ADDICTION.

14:24.660 --> 14:27.652
- BECAUSE WE'RE ALL HUMAN.
- NO, HONEY, WE'RE NOT.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.729
- ( door closes )
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO LEARN.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.161
- Nate: HI.
- HEY!

14:32.270 --> 14:33.931
- Maya: HI, MOMMY.
- HELLO, MAYA.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.237
- HOW'S MY FAVORITE
LITTLE GIRL?
- ( Maya shrieks )

14:39.440 --> 14:40.907
HELLO, MARGARET.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.001
NATE.
OH, LOOK AT YOU

14:43.110 --> 14:45.249
AND YOUR HAPPY
LITTLE FAMILY.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.114
MOMMY JUST
ORDERED CHINESE

14:48.220 --> 14:51.087
- AND IT'S GOING
TO BE HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
- PERFECT.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.283
MY MOM'S TRYING TO CONVINCE
ME THAT I'M MAKING

14:53.390 --> 14:55.415
A HUGE MISTAKE BY WORKING
AT A FREE CLINIC.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.250
- I THINK IT'S KIND OF GREAT.
- YES, LET'S ALL SAVE
THE WORLD.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.055
WELL, WHY NOT SAVE
THE WORLD?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.390
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH
BEING NAIVE ABOUT THIS.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.889
WELL, SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD THING.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.820
Maya:
I WANNA GO READ
"PETER RABBIT."

15:06.940 --> 15:08.669
Nate:
YOU WANNA GO READ
"PETER RABBIT?"

15:08.770 --> 15:11.159
Woman on TV:
Scientists at the time
blame the deaths

15:11.270 --> 15:13.238
of million of fish
in North Carolina waters...

15:13.340 --> 15:16.730
SO, YOU WANT MOVE UP
TO MY ROOM?

15:16.840 --> 15:20.310
I DO BUT I SHOULD GO.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.240
IT'S COMPLETELY PRIVATE
UP THERE.

15:22.350 --> 15:25.581
- WELL...
- AND NO ONE MINDS
IF YOU STAY OVER.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.555
( chuckles )

15:29.360 --> 15:31.578
AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.523
UH... NO.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.689
OF COURSE NOT.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.529
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.
( chuckles )

15:38.630 --> 15:41.133
MY WIFE'S ACTUALLY.

15:42.770 --> 15:45.705
UH, DO YOU
REMEMBER SHARON?

15:45.810 --> 15:49.439
UH, OF COURSE.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.872
WE MET AT THE WEDDING.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.039
OH, YEAH, NATE
AND BRENDA'S WEDDING.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.948
- IT'S NICE
TO SEE YB? AGAIN.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.018
SO ANYTHING GOOD ON?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.759
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.579
SOMETHING ABOUT FISH
I THINK.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.624
HUH.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.592
- I SHOULD GO.
- OH, REALLY?

16:12.700 --> 16:13.962
- YEAH.
- YOU SURE?

16:14.070 --> 16:16.664
TOMORROW'S
MY DAY OFF, SO...

16:16.770 --> 16:18.306
SO WHAT'S THE HURRY?

16:18.410 --> 16:21.504
I HAVE A BUNCH OF ERRANDS
TO DO IN THE MORNING.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.305
AH...
(sighs)

16:23.410 --> 16:26.447
- OKAY, LET ME WALK YOU OUT.
- NO, I'M FINE.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.212
STAY HERE WITH GEORGE.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.187
- WANNA HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW?
- YEAH. GREAT.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.985
- YEAH?
- YEAH, GIVE ME A CALL.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.718
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

16:39.890 --> 16:42.051
( sighs )

16:45.500 --> 16:48.298
I'M SORRY, BABY,
I'M NOT GONNA COME
TONIGHT.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.561
IT'S OKAY.

16:52.510 --> 16:56.037
IT'S NOT THE LITHIUM.
IT'S THE SEROQUEL.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.972
IT, UH...

16:59.080 --> 17:03.540
SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO EJACULATE.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.447
THAT'S OKAY.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.781
I THOUGHT I WAS PASSED
ALL THAT, THOUGH.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.488
I HATE THIS.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.865
BILLY, IT'S OKAY.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.837
I CAME ALREADY.
( chuckles )

17:20.940 --> 17:23.158
OH, SO I DON'T MATTER,
RIGHT?

17:23.270 --> 17:25.067
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.309
YOU'RE HERE PURELY
TO SERVICE ME.

17:27.410 --> 17:30.140
AND NOW THAT
YOU'VE SATISFIED ME,
I MUST KILL YOU.

17:34.380 --> 17:38.043
SERIOUSLY,
DON'T FREAK OUT
ABOUT THIS.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.584
IT'LL JUST MAKE
THE NEXT TIME THAT
MUCH BETTER.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.961
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO NAME HIM LOGAN.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.664
David:
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE LOGAN?

17:53.770 --> 17:55.328
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.806
IT'S LIKE A PORN STAR NAME.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.249
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.148
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT ME?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.844
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.

18:08.950 --> 18:11.783
- SHUT UP.
- I MEAN IT.

18:20.030 --> 18:21.622
YOU'RE STARTING
TO CREEP ME OUT.

18:21.730 --> 18:24.392
I WANT OUR BABY
TO BE PART YOU, TOO.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.139
WELL, I THINK WE'RE
OUT OF LUCK THERE.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.891
NOT IF WE ASK CLAIRE
TO DONATE SOME OF HER EGGS.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.900
- CLAIRE?
- YEAH.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.832
THEN THE BABY COULD
BE LIKE A COMBINATION
OF THE TWO OF US.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.545
OR AS CLOSE AS WE
COULD GET ANYWAY.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.470
UH...

18:41.950 --> 18:44.145
WELL, I GUESS I COULD ASK.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.946
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

18:47.050 --> 18:49.189
REALLY?

18:50.790 --> 18:52.758
DEFINITELY.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.733
( square dancing
music playing )

19:08.840 --> 19:10.603
( rooster crowing )

19:10.710 --> 19:12.871
( cows mooing )

19:32.170 --> 19:33.990
I AM THE EGG MAN.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.762
GOO-GOO-GA-JOOB?

19:55.360 --> 19:57.828
( horse whinnies )

20:21.380 --> 20:23.848
( tractor engine rattling )

20:31.890 --> 20:34.552
- DADDY.
- ( shrieks )

20:34.660 --> 20:39.529
- ( shower running )
- ( Keith humming )

20:46.110 --> 20:48.601
( groans )

20:51.250 --> 20:52.808
( baby crying )

20:52.910 --> 20:54.411
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

20:54.520 --> 20:57.614
IT'S OKAY.
JUST CALM DOWN.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.427
OH, UH, EXCUSE ME.
I'M BREN...

21:05.530 --> 21:08.090
HI, BRENDA CHENOWITH.
I'M HERE TO SEE
EILEEN GOLDBERG.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.998
BRENDA, HI.
I'M EILEEN.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.534
- HI.
- FOLLOW ME.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.837
TRY NOT TO TRIP OVER
ANY OF OUR FAMILY.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.907
SO, THIS YOUR OFFICE.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.547
YOU'LL SHARE IT WITH MOHAN
OUR OTHER INTERN.

21:26.650 --> 21:29.744
HE'S TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS
AND YOU'RE MONDAY, WEDNESDAY
AND FRIDAY.

21:29.850 --> 21:32.683
SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL
NEVER MEET, 'CAUSE HE'S
KIND OF A MORON.

21:32.790 --> 21:35.281
WE HAVE A STAFF MEETING
AT 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

21:35.390 --> 21:39.429
UNTIL THEN, MAYBE YOU
COULD READ THROUGH SOME
OF THESE FILES.

21:39.530 --> 21:41.157
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

21:41.260 --> 21:44.127
UM...

21:44.230 --> 21:47.097
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
WE NEED YOU.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.738
- I'M GLAD I'M HERE, TOO.
- OKAY.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.893
( piano music playing )

22:20.900 --> 22:22.265
( whispers )
HEY.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.304
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A LUNCH.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.435
I DO.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.599
I'M JUST WAITING FOR HER
TO CALL ME BACK.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.541
I STARTED THE PREP WORK
ON THE OTHER BODY.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.845
- I'LL FINISH IT UP
BY TOMORROW.
- GOOD.

22:32.950 --> 22:35.418
MIGHT BE A LONG LUNCH

22:35.520 --> 22:37.147
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.115
( chuckles )
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.211
YEAH.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.754
I REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.393
NATE.

22:50.570 --> 22:54.597
- OH MY GOD.
TOM WHEELER. HEY.
- YEAH!

22:54.700 --> 22:57.294
WHEN I HEARD
THE FUNERAL WAS HERE
I WAS HOPING I'D SEE YOU.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.106
- LAST I HEARD YOU WERE
STILL UP IN SEATTLE.
- YEAH YEAH.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.428
WELL, NO,
I'M...

23:02.540 --> 23:05.543
- BACK HERE NOW.
WORKING HERE.
- REALLY?

23:05.650 --> 23:07.914
- YOU ALWAYS SWORE THAT--
- YEAH YEAH, I KNOW.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.547
BUT THE FUNNY THIS IS
I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS WORK.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.288
WOW. THAT'S GREAT.

23:13.390 --> 23:16.382
THAT'S GREAT.
I'VE GOT A SOFTWARE CONSULTING
FIRM OVER IN ENCINO.

23:16.490 --> 23:18.321
- OH, GREAT GREAT.
- YEAH, IT IS GOOD.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.852
I'VE GOT A WIFE,
THREE KIDS.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.121
BASICALLY TURNED
INTO MY FATHER.
( chuckles )

23:22.230 --> 23:25.119
YOUR FATHER WAS
A REALLY GOOD GUY
AS I REMEMBER HIM.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.959
MY DAD NEVER
BOUGHT US BEER.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.595
ALTHOUGH, HE PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE IF I'D ASKED HIM.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.839
MY OLDEST--
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
( sighs )

23:31.940 --> 23:34.636
HE'S 18.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.503
HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE
IN THE FALL.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.339
MAN, WE ARE GETTING
UP THERE, AREN'T WE?

23:38.450 --> 23:40.338
( chuckles )
YEAH.

23:40.450 --> 23:44.045
MAN, IT IS REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.085
BUT, DAMN, I WISH IT WAS
UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

23:47.190 --> 23:48.851
YEAH.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.758
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO BELIEVE SAM'S DEAD.

23:51.860 --> 23:55.193
YEAH, I NEVER WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT HE'D BE
THE FIRST ONE TO GO.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.093
SO HOW DOES SOMEONE
RUN OVER HIMSELF?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.431
I DON'T KNOW.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.360
- LISTEN, I'VE GOTTA
GPAY RESPECT S.
- OKAY.

24:05.470 --> 24:09.099
- WHAT DO YOU SAY GET
A BEER LATER, CATCH UP?
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

24:09.210 --> 24:10.802
OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.672
( sighs )

24:13.780 --> 24:16.510
Ruth:
HE HAS GOOD DAYS
AND HE HAS BAD DAYS.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.383
MORE BAD THAN GOOD.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.139
REALLY?

24:20.250 --> 24:22.480
WHENEVER I TALK TO HIM
ON THE PHONE HE SOUNDS GREAT.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.455
WELL, YOUR CALLS
ALWAYS HELP.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.222
( chuckles )
I THOUGHT I HEARD
YOUR VOICE.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.854
- HI, DADDY.
- HI, SWEETIE.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.359
HI.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.098
WOW.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.236
- YOU LOOK SO GOOD.
- WELL, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.901
I GUESS SENDING THOUSANDS
OF VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY
THROUGH THE BRAIN

24:38.010 --> 24:40.365
- MUST'VE DONE THE TRICK.
- THAT'S SO GOOD TO HEAR.

24:40.470 --> 24:43.542
HERE, SIT DOWN.
I MADE SOME ICED TEA.

24:46.550 --> 24:48.017
THANK YOU.

24:51.220 --> 24:55.486
I'M, UH, STILL HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH MY MEMORY.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.888
YESTERDAY HE FORGOT
OUR HOME PHONE NUMBER.

24:57.990 --> 25:00.481
THEY NEEDED IT
AT THE PHARMACY

25:00.600 --> 25:05.094
AND HE WAS HUNTING
ALL OVER THE STORE FOR ME
LIKE A LOST LITTLE BOY.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.168
GETS PRETTY FRUSTRATING.

25:07.270 --> 25:10.068
BUT, DAD, THAT'S NORMAL.
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.603
OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

25:11.710 --> 25:15.100
THE DOCTOR SAID IT COULD
BE A VERY LONG HAUL.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.975
SO, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
FILLING YOUR TIME?

25:20.080 --> 25:23.811
OH, RESTING MOSTLY.
AND A LOT OF READING.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.683
I JUST FINISHED
CLINTON'S BOOK.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.678
- OH, I'VE BEEN
WANTING TO READ THAT?
- REALLY?

25:27.790 --> 25:29.815
LET ME GET IT FOR YOU.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.822
- BEFORE I FORGET.
- ( chuckles )

25:36.860 --> 25:39.067
WELL, HE SEEMS
SO MUCH BETTER.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.889
WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID
I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO EXPECT.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.867
I'M NEVER SURE
WHAT TO EXPECT.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.837
EVERY DAY'S
A NEW ADVENTURE.

25:49.610 --> 25:52.499
HEY, SHARON.
IT'S RICO AGAIN.

25:52.610 --> 25:56.011
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.908
BUT, UH, WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE ME A CALL BACK
SO WE CAN RESCHEDULE?

26:00.020 --> 26:03.057
OKAY? BYE-BYE.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.978
Claire:
THANKS FOR HELPING
ME WITH THIS.

26:07.090 --> 26:08.626
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.869
BE NICE TO HAVE
SOMETHING FEELS
REMOTELY FAMILIAR

26:10.970 --> 26:13.689
- AT BILLY'S APARTMENT.
- I CAN RELATE.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.429
OF COURSE, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO DO A FAVOR

26:17.540 --> 26:20.464
- FOR ME IN RETURN...
- WHAT?

26:20.570 --> 26:22.834
IT'S AIG FAVOR.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.147
OKAY.

26:29.820 --> 26:32.789
DONATE SOME OF YOUR EGGS
TO KEITH AND ME?

26:34.420 --> 26:37.218
OH.

26:39.060 --> 26:41.824
- LIKE WHEN?
- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
I GUESS.

26:41.930 --> 26:44.967
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO FIND
A SURROGATE FIRST.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.367
UH-HUH.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.893
AND THEN YOU WOULD BOTH HAVE
TO GO ON BIRTH CONTROL PILLS

26:49.000 --> 26:51.161
AT THE SAME TIME
SO YOUR CYCLES

26:51.270 --> 26:52.965
WOULD COINCIDE.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.675
THEN THERE WOULD BE ALL SORTS
OF HORMONE INJECTIONS.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.647
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO EXERCISE OR ANYTHING.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.412
NO DRUGS OR DRINKING,
OF COURSE.

27:01.520 --> 27:05.047
EVENTUALLY, THE EGGS
WOULD BE HARVESTED

27:05.150 --> 27:08.278
THROUGH A NEEDLE INSERTED
INTO THE VAGINA.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.984
YOUR VAGINA.

27:11.090 --> 27:15.493
- EW.
- IT'S LIKE SURGERY.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.352
( chuckles nervously)

27:17.460 --> 27:19.667
WOW.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.897
OKAY, I GET IT.
IT'S ASKING TOO MUCH.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.309
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T GIVEN
THAT MUCH THOUGHT

27:24.410 --> 27:26.332
TO MY EGGS.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.603
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY
SURE I WANT TO GIVE ANY
OF THEM AWAY.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.701
IT REALLY WASN'T FAIR
OF ME TO ASK.

27:32.810 --> 27:35.916
- YOU'RE NOT MAD?
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
NO.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.245
EVEN IF IT ALL WORKED OUT,
THERE WOULD BE THE WEIRDNESS

27:39.350 --> 27:41.989
OF HAVING A NIECE
THAT YOU'RE ALSO
THE MOTHER OF.

27:42.090 --> 27:44.320
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY
KIND OF CREEPY.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.228
IT COULD MAKE
THANKSGIVING DINNERS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

27:47.330 --> 27:49.252
( chuckles )

27:53.200 --> 27:55.839
EVERYONE SAY HELLO
TO BRENDA CHENOWITH
OUR NEW INTERN.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.931
- HI.
- HELLO.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.860
HI.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.973
OKAY.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.344
WE'RE ABOUT TO
DISCUSS THE CASE OF ONE
TANISHA WILLIAMS.

28:05.450 --> 28:09.375
32 YEARS OLD,
HABITUAL ABUSER
OF CRACK COCAINE

28:09.480 --> 28:11.038
AND OCCASIONAL
PROSTITUTE.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.755
THE STATE IS SEEKING CUSTODY
OF HER 12-YEAR-OLD CHILD

28:13.860 --> 28:17.819
AFTER SAID CHILD COMPLAINED
THAT HER MOTHER TIED HER
TO THE COFFEE TABLE,

28:17.930 --> 28:20.899
WHIPPED HER UNTIL SHE BLED
AND THEN SEXUALLY MOLESTED HER

28:21.000 --> 28:23.218
WITH A ROLLED UP COPY
OF "NEWSWEEK."

28:23.330 --> 28:26.390
ALL FOR THE VIEWING PLEASURE
OF HER BOYFRIEND.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.139
I'M SURE THE KID'S LYING.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.162
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WOMAN
READS "NEWSWEEK."

28:31.270 --> 28:33.158
( group laughs)

28:33.270 --> 28:35.977
IS THIS THE SAME CHILD
WITH ALL THE BURN MARKS?

28:36.080 --> 28:37.945
Man:
NO, THAT'S HER SISTER.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.814
Woman:
SINCE THE CHILDREN
HAVE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE--

28:43.820 --> 28:45.685
Eileen:
HEY.

28:45.790 --> 28:49.112
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

28:49.220 --> 28:52.280
NO, I MEAN-- WHEW.

28:52.390 --> 28:54.324
( chuckles )

28:54.430 --> 28:56.022
DON'T FEEL BAD.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.462
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
IN A STRONG PLACE
TO WORK HERE.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.164
I'M IN A STRONG PLACE.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.158
GOOD.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.902
( sighs )

29:11.610 --> 29:14.613
Sharon's voice:
Hey, it's Sharon.
I'm not in right now.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.915
Please leave me
a message--

29:18.520 --> 29:19.987
( sighs )

29:25.590 --> 29:28.821
EXCUSE ME.
HAVE YOU SEEN SHARON KINNEY?

29:28.930 --> 29:32.093
NO, SORRY.
HAVEN'T SEEN HER
AROUND TODAY.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.895
THANK YOU!

29:44.450 --> 29:46.077
( phone rings )

29:46.180 --> 29:47.772
HELLO, RICO.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.643
Rico:
Hey, Vanessa.

29:49.750 --> 29:54.289
UH, LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK I CAN TAKE
THE KIDS OUT TONIGHT.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.984
I DIDN'T MAKE DINNER FOR THEM.
YOU SAID YOU'D TAKE THEM OUT.

29:57.090 --> 29:59.957
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
BUT A FRIEND OF MINE
IS MISSING

30:00.060 --> 30:01.152
AND I'M STARTING
TO WORRY.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.319
- What friend?
- SHARON.

30:03.430 --> 30:05.466
WHAT, THAT WOMAN
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING?

30:05.570 --> 30:08.198
- Yeah.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE'S MISSING?

30:08.300 --> 30:10.564
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE JUST DISAPPEARED.

30:10.670 --> 30:13.559
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.
HAVE YOU STARTED CALLING
THE HOSPITALS?

30:13.670 --> 30:17.401
OH, MAN.
I GUESS I SHOULD.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.048
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE KIDS.

30:21.150 --> 30:24.381
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I HOPE YOU FIND HER.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.582
AND I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.715
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.
- Bye, Rico.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.015
( dialing )

30:30.120 --> 30:32.782
Operator:
City and listing?

30:32.890 --> 30:35.859
UH, YES, LOS ANGELES.
COUNTY HOSPITAL.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.623
THIS TEA IS INTERESTING.

30:39.730 --> 30:42.164
- WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?
- YERBA MATE.

30:42.270 --> 30:45.637
YOU MUST FIND
ALL KINDS OF NEW THINGS
IN YOUR ADVENTURES.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.628
WHAT ADVENTURES?

30:47.740 --> 30:50.868
I MOSTLY SEE MY HOTEL
ROOM AND THE INSIDE
OF DOCTOR'S OFFICES.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.711
STILL, HAWAII,
SAN FRANCISCO,
PORTLAND.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.380
IT ALL SOUNDS
SO EXCITING.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.983
I LIKE IT.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.615
- I GET TO SET
MY OWN SCHEDULE.
- ( snoring )

31:02.720 --> 31:04.449
YEAH, THERE ARE
PLENTY OF PERKS.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.154
ARE YOU DATING ANYONE?

31:07.260 --> 31:11.162
THERE MUST BE MEN LINED
AT THE DOOR TO SEE YOU.
DOCTORS.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.522
( chuckles )
YEAH, LIKE THEY'RE
SUCH PRIZES.

31:18.070 --> 31:21.176
I GUESS MEN ARE THE SAME
EVERYWHERE.

31:22.810 --> 31:25.677
ACTUALLY, I HAVE BEEN
DATING A DOCTOR

31:25.780 --> 31:26.940
IN PHOENIX FOR A WHILE.

31:27.050 --> 31:29.143
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- PHILIP.

31:29.250 --> 31:32.139
- TELL ME.
- NO, HE'S FINE.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.889
HE'S A LITTLE OBSESSED
WITH HIS WORK.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.855
BUT THAT'S NORMAL.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.758
- IS IT SERIOUS?
- WELL, HE SEEMS TO THINK SO.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.691
BUT...

31:41.800 --> 31:44.223
I'M IN NO HURRY
TO GET MARRIED.

31:44.330 --> 31:46.127
GOOD FOR YOU.

31:46.230 --> 31:49.461
IF YOU WANT
MY ADVICE AN D--
( chuckles )

31:49.570 --> 31:52.539
LORD KNOWS I'M NOT ONE
TO GIVE ADVICE.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.677
BUT I THINK YOU
SHOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING INTO

31:55.780 --> 31:57.634
BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT JUMP.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.469
MARRIAGE IS HARD.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.659
I KNOW THIS MUST
BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.448
MY FATHER.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.357
THANK YOU
FOR SAYING THAT.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.690
SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL
I NEED TO HEAR.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.167
THAT SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.308
YOU KNOW, I DON'T USUALLY
GIVE ADVICE, EITHER.

32:27.410 --> 32:31.141
BUT I THINK,
IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH

32:31.250 --> 32:34.469
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE MAN
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH
IS STILL IN THERE.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.181
( snores )

32:46.530 --> 32:49.454
- ( cell phone rings )
- ( Latin music playing )

32:52.700 --> 32:53.826
YES?

32:53.930 --> 32:56.967
HI, MOM.
IT'S ME, BRENDA.

32:57.070 --> 32:59.959
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
THOSE CALLS FOR YOU?

33:00.940 --> 33:03.374
YES.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.471
OH, I FEEL AWFUL.

33:05.580 --> 33:08.413
WELL, HONEY, THOSE PEOPLE
ARE SO DEPRESSING.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.613
( scoffs )
MOM, IT'S NOT THAT.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.585
IT'S...

33:12.690 --> 33:14.510
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S--

33:14.620 --> 33:16.178
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T REALLY
THE JOB FOR YOU.

33:16.290 --> 33:19.179
YEAH YEAH,
MAYBE NOT.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.758
You just don't know
how to dress down like them.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.067
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
A WALKING TARGET.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.229
YEAH, MOM, YOU'RE RIGHT,
THAT'S IT.

33:26.330 --> 33:29.493
AND LET US NOT FORGET,
YOU JUST HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.807
WELL, I REALLY DON'T SEE WHAT
THAT'S GOT TO DO WITH IT.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.174
HONEY, YOU'RE STILL
IN SHOCK.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.373
I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE MORE IN TUNE

33:36.480 --> 33:38.277
WITH MY EMOTIONAL STATE
THAN ME.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.598
WELL, I'M A VERY GOOD
PSYCHOLOGIST.

33:40.710 --> 33:44.339
- I was being sarcastic.
- I KNOW THAT AS WELL.

33:44.450 --> 33:47.647
WELL, DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME
A BILL FOR $200.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.548
Oh, I won't.
( laughs )

33:50.660 --> 33:53.220
Wolf:
SOMEHOW WE END UP
IN CAMBODIA.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.821
AND IT IS LIKE,
"HOLY FUCK"!

33:55.930 --> 33:58.228
A WORLD YOU NEVER
EVEN KNEW EXISTED.

33:58.330 --> 34:01.128
WE LIVED
IN A LITTLE TREE HOUSE
UP WITH THE BIRDS.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.129
OH, GOD.
THAT SOUNDS SO AMAZING,

34:04.240 --> 34:06.401
JUST TRAVELING LIKE THAT.

34:06.510 --> 34:09.035
YOU HAVE TO.
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AS AN ARTIST

34:09.140 --> 34:11.199
TO TRY EVERYTHING
THAT WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.904
WE JUST WENT WHEREVER
WE WANTED TILL THE MONEY
RAN OUT.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.739
AND GET THIS.
THE BEST PART WAS,

34:15.850 --> 34:18.910
WHEN WE GOT BACK
THE FIRST PIECE OF MAIL
THAT I OPENED

34:19.020 --> 34:20.419
WAS THIS HUGE FUCKING CHECK.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.318
- OH, WOW.
- YEAH, THIS GRANT
IS A GODSEND.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.388
GIVES US ENOUGH MONEY
TO LIVE ON FOR A YEAR

34:25.490 --> 34:27.355
WHILE I GET BACK TO WORK
ON MY INSTALLATION.

34:27.460 --> 34:30.850
THAT IS SO GREAT.
GOD, I WISH I COULD
GET A GRANT.

34:30.960 --> 34:34.532
IS THIS STILL THE,
UH, POULTRY THING?

34:34.640 --> 34:37.268
YES, BUT IT'S EXPANDED
WAY BEYOND THAT NOW.

34:37.370 --> 34:39.258
YOU NEED TO COME
BY OUR NEW SPACE
AND CHECK IT OUT.

34:39.370 --> 34:42.032
- IT'S AMAZING.
- I WOULD LOVE TO.

34:42.140 --> 34:44.108
YEAH, WE'RE STILL
UNPACKING SHIT.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.747
YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND
WAS THAT VIDEO WE SHOT

34:46.850 --> 34:50.172
- WHEN WE TURNED
THE L.A. RIVER RED.
-(laughs)

34:50.280 --> 34:52.510
OH NO, NOT AS DAUNTING
AS IT SOUNDS.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.259
IT HADN'T RAINED IN MONTHS.
THERE WAS AN INCH OF WATER.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.659
BUT STILL IT WAS, LIKE,
THIS TRICKLE OF BLOOD

34:58.760 --> 35:01.593
- SNAKING THROUGH THE CITY.
-(laughs)

35:03.360 --> 35:05.089
IT WAS PRETTY COOL.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.335
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY TALKED YOU
INTO BECOMING A PROFESSOR.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.567
WELL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR.

35:12.670 --> 35:15.878
BUT, UH, YEAH,
IT'S NOT SO BAD,
YOU KNOW?

35:15.980 --> 35:17.106
GOT TO PAY THE RENT.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.178
WELL, YOU'RE A BETTER
MAN THAN ME.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.408
HE IS SUCH
AN AMAZING TEACHER.
REALLY.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.148
WELL, THOSE
THAT CAN'T, DO.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.980
SO, BILLY SAID YOU'RE
WORKING ON A NEW SERIES.

35:28.090 --> 35:30.058
YEAH, YEAH.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.923
I JUST SHOWED THEM
TO MY GALLERY OWNER.

35:32.030 --> 35:35.454
WHO LOVED THEM,
BUT HE STILL WANTS MORE
OF MY OLD SERIES.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.551
HE DOES?
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.867
YEAH, I GUESS HE THINKS
I'M A FACTORY

35:39.970 --> 35:43.861
WHO'S GOING
TO KEEP CHURNING OUT
THE SAME STUFF.

35:43.970 --> 35:46.905
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU, BILLY?
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING
ON THESE DAYS?

35:49.310 --> 35:52.177
WELL, MOLDING IMPRESSIONABLE
YOUNG MINDS.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.508
ARGUING FOR A DECENT BUDGET.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.316
OH, GOD.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.672
I'M SO GLAD I'M OUT
OF THAT WORLD.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.386
ME, TOO.
I AM NEVER SETTING FOOT
ON A CAMPUS AGAIN.

36:01.490 --> 36:04.050
I MEAN, HOW DO
YOU EVEN HAVE TIME

36:04.160 --> 36:06.321
TO DO YOUR REAL WORK?

36:06.430 --> 36:08.352
TO BE HONEST,
I'M NOT EXACTLY

36:08.460 --> 36:10.223
OVERFLOWING
WITH IDEAS JUST NOW.

36:10.330 --> 36:14.437
MMM.
WE ALL HIT DRY SPOTS.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.861
Billy:
YEAH, THAT WE DO.

36:19.140 --> 36:21.131
Tom:
SO HOW ARE YOU
HANDLING IT?

36:21.240 --> 36:23.379
- HANDLING WHAT?
- TURNING 40.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.471
IT'S A COUPLE MONTHS
FROM NOW, RIGHT?

36:25.580 --> 36:27.502
YEAH, YEAH.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.111
I THINK I'M HANDLING
IT FINE.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.745
I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.943
( laughs )
YEAH, RIGHT.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.352
LISTEN, UM...

36:37.460 --> 36:39.087
CAN I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

36:39.190 --> 36:41.420
SURE.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.851
DO YOU HAVE
A HARDER TIME NOW?

36:43.960 --> 36:47.259
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
GETTING WOOD?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.531
YEAH.
YEAH, OCCASIONALLY.

36:53.470 --> 36:55.370
DO YOU EVER LOOK AT GIRLS?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.300
YOUNG GIRLS, LIKE, 14-15?

36:57.410 --> 37:00.607
YOU GET THAT SAME FEELING
YOU GOT WHEN YOU
WERE THAT AGE.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.519
AND THEN YOU'RE SO
FUCKING HARD

37:02.620 --> 37:04.588
IT FEELS LIKE
IT MIGHT BREAK.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.341
I HAVE A DAUGHTER, TOM.
SO I DON'T LOOK AT YOUNG
GIRLS LIKE THAT.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.782
LIAR. LOOK, I'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, TOO.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.882
SHE'S 13, OF COURSE
I DON'T LOOK AT HER
THAT WAY.

37:12.990 --> 37:15.550
BUT SHE'S GOT
THIS ONE FRIEND.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.161
AND, JESUS, FUCK.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.534
SHE IS JUST SO PERFECT.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.767
SHE'S A CHILD, TOM.
YOU CANNOT GO THERE.

37:23.870 --> 37:26.304
LOOK, NATE, I KNOW SHE IS!
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

37:26.410 --> 37:30.528
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN
THE THOUGHT OF ACTUAL SEX.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.871
IT'S JUST-- IT'S THAT--
( grunts )

37:33.980 --> 37:35.572
THAT YOUNG--

37:35.680 --> 37:37.614
ALL THAT ENERGY,
YOU KNOW?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.688
IT'S LIKES SHE REMINDS ME
OF THIS PART OF ME

37:39.790 --> 37:41.417
THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN
EVEN EXISTED.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.919
- YOU KNOW?
- NO, I DON'T KNOW.

37:43.020 --> 37:46.285
REALLY?
NATE, DON'T YOU EVER LIE
AWAKE IN BED AT NIGHT

37:46.390 --> 37:49.427
AND JUST THINK,
"JESUS, FUCK,

37:49.530 --> 37:52.522
I'M GOING TO BE 40
FUCKING YEARS OLD"?

37:52.630 --> 37:55.098
NO, I DON'T. I LIE
IN BED AWAKE AT NIGHT

37:55.200 --> 37:58.363
THINKING, "THANK YOU,
GOD, FOR LETTING ME
LIVE THIS LONG."

37:58.470 --> 38:00.961
ARE YOU, LIKE, CHRISTIAN
OR SOMETHING?

38:01.070 --> 38:03.106
( chuckles )
NO.

38:03.210 --> 38:07.271
I'VE JUST HAD
A LOT OF SERIOUS SHIT
HAPPEN TO ME IN MY LIFE.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.644
AND I REALLY GET IT NOW
THAT THIS DOESN'T LAST.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.638
AND I'M NO DIFFERENT
FROM ANYBODY ELSE.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.945
YES, INDEED THIS WILL
HAPPEN TO ME.

38:14.050 --> 38:17.451
IT IS HAPPENING TO ME
A LITTLE BIT EACH EVERYDAY.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.525
AND THAT DOESN'T
FREAK ME OUT.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.689
IF ANYTHING,
IT'S LIBERATING.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.291
OKAY, SO I GUESS IT COMES
WITH THE TERRITORY?

38:26.400 --> 38:27.958
I MEAN, YOUR JOB.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.538
NO, I DON'T THINK
IT'S THE JOB, REALLY.
IT'S JUST--

38:30.640 --> 38:33.939
THE JOB ALLOWS ME
TO PRACTICE BEING
OKAY WITH IT.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.634
YEAH YEAH, OKAY, SO THERE.
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.776
OKAY?
SO YOU'RE REALLY
NOT OKAY WITH IT.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.338
- OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE.
- YEAH, BUT NATE...

38:42.450 --> 38:44.384
IT'S JUST SO FUCKING BIG.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.709
I MEAN, IT'S ALL GOING
BY SO FUCKING FAST.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.811
- WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING?
- LIKE WHAT?

38:49.920 --> 38:53.424
LIKE WHO YOU'RE WITH
OR WHAT YOU DO OR WHAT
KIND OF PERSON YOU ARE.

38:53.530 --> 38:56.124
BECAUSE IF YOU WOULD,
DO IT NOW.

38:56.230 --> 38:58.562
WHOA, DUDE.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.639
- THAT'S REALLY HARSH.
- LOOK, THIS IS IT, TOM!

39:01.740 --> 39:03.958
THIS IS ALL WE HAVE.
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.499
YOU KNOW,
I'VE GOT TO GO HOME.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.078
I WANNA BE THERE
BEFORE MAYA GOES TO BED.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.148
( sniffs )

39:16.250 --> 39:18.548
- IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU.
- YEAH, MAN.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.982
IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU.
WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER
SOMETIME.

39:21.090 --> 39:22.887
YEAH YEAH, OKAY.

39:22.990 --> 39:24.651
YEAH, GIVE ME A CALL.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.854
SO WHAT'S EVERYONE UP TO?
SHOULD WE HIT THE CONCORD?

39:30.960 --> 39:32.564
- OH.
- YEAH.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.230
I'VE BEEN DYING TO GO THERE.
YOU THINK WE CAN GET IN?

39:35.340 --> 39:37.968
WOLF COULD GET HIS
PUBLICIST TO MAKE A CALL.

39:38.070 --> 39:40.106
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO IT WITHOUT ME.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.007
- NO!
- YEAH, I'M BEAT.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.408
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU GOT ANOTHER PARTY
YOU'RE GOING TO?

39:44.510 --> 39:46.148
YOU DON'T WANT US
SLOWING YOU DOWN?

39:46.250 --> 39:48.445
NO, I STILL GOT TO WORK
ON MY LESSON PLAN
FOR NEXT WEEK.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.211
YOU SERIOUS?
COME ON, MAN.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.083
WHERE'S THE OLD BILLY
I USED TO KNOW?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.909
HE'S GOING
TO THE RESTROOM.

39:59.390 --> 40:01.426
IS HE DOING OKAY?

40:01.530 --> 40:03.725
HMM? YEAH.
HE'S GREAT.

40:03.830 --> 40:06.128
- HMM.
- WHY, YOU DON'T
THINK HE IS?

40:06.230 --> 40:09.290
I DON'T KNOW.
THE BILLY CHENOWITH I KNEW
WOULDN'T BE GOING HOME EARLY.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.801
HE'D HAVE US OUT
ALL NIGHT DOING SOMETHING
COMPLETELY INSANE.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.546
( water running )

40:40.970 --> 40:43.495
IT'S NICE TO HAVE MAGGIE
HERE, ISN'T IT?

40:43.600 --> 40:45.830
YES, IT CERTAINLY IS.

40:46.940 --> 40:50.899
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW
THINGS I DID RIGHT.

40:51.010 --> 40:54.275
THAT AND MARRY YOU.

40:54.380 --> 40:57.076
YOU'RE A SWEET ONE
WHEN YOU WANT TO BE.

40:57.180 --> 41:00.809
IT'S EASY TO BE SWEET
WHEN I'M MARRIED TO YOU.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.022
GOOD NIGHT, GEORGE.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.958
GOOD NIGHT.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.648
( organ playing )

41:37.020 --> 41:38.885
HE HAD A TATTOO.

41:38.990 --> 41:42.653
- HUH?
- SAM HAD A TATTOO
ON HIS ASS

41:42.760 --> 41:44.660
THAT SAID,
"U.S.D.A. PRIME BEEF."

41:44.770 --> 41:47.659
( laughs )
WELL, IT WAS 1982.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.034
SORRY, MY CRUSH
IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.108
OH.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.929
IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT
FROM HERE, I HAVE A BODY
WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.201
WAIT A MINUTE,
I THOUGHT RICO
WAS HANDLING IT.

41:57.310 --> 41:58.743
HE HAD AN EMERGENCY
WITH SHARON.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.876
WHAT KIND
OF AN EMERGENCY?

42:05.550 --> 42:08.280
UH, HI,
I'M TOM WHEELER.

42:08.390 --> 42:12.486
I FIRST MET SAM
IN THE 10th GRADE

42:12.590 --> 42:15.457
WHEN HE TALKED
ME AND NATE,

42:15.560 --> 42:17.790
WHO STANDS RIGHT
BEHIND YOU THERE,

42:17.900 --> 42:19.765
INTO CUTTING
BIOLOGY CLASS.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.430
THEN WE JUMPED OUT
THE SECOND STORY WINDOW.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.031
NATE WHEN FIRST
AND SPRAINED HIS ANKLE.

42:25.140 --> 42:27.358
I LANDED WITHOUT INJURY.

42:27.470 --> 42:28.869
UNTIL, OF COURSE,
SAM JUMPED ON ME

42:28.980 --> 42:31.608
AND GAVE ME
A MILD CONCUSSION.
( laughs )

42:31.710 --> 42:34.076
AT THAT MOMENT

42:34.180 --> 42:37.274
OR FATES WERE SEALED
AS BEST FRIENDS.

42:37.380 --> 42:41.009
BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE
WERE SPENT WITH THESE GUYS.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.681
BUT AS ALWAYS HAPPENS
AS TIME GOES BY...

42:44.790 --> 42:47.623
( with Russian accent)
ONCE WE HAD PEOPLE
USING AN APARTMENT

42:47.730 --> 42:50.051
FOR PURPOSES
OF PROSTITUTION.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.323
BUT I KICKED THEM RIGHT
OUT ON THEIR ZADNEK.

42:53.430 --> 42:56.490
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S DOING ANYTHING
LIKE THIS, DO YOU?

42:56.600 --> 42:58.830
OH, NO. NO NO NO.
SHE'S JUST BEEN MISSING

42:58.940 --> 43:01.807
AND I'M REALLY WORRIED
THAT SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HER.

43:01.910 --> 43:05.300
SHARON,
YOU IN THERE?

43:09.680 --> 43:11.648
( sniffs )

43:11.750 --> 43:14.583
I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.780
( flies buzzing )

43:21.900 --> 43:23.595
HELLO.

43:23.700 --> 43:26.328
SHARON?

43:28.530 --> 43:31.237
OH MY GOD!
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

43:31.340 --> 43:32.568
YOU'RE HERE!

43:32.670 --> 43:34.774
YOU CAME INTO MY APARTMENT.
ARE YOU CRAZY?

43:34.880 --> 43:37.701
- HE INSISTED I LET HIM IN.
- I WAS WORRIED!

43:37.810 --> 43:39.675
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
LUNCH YESTERDAY

43:39.780 --> 43:41.748
AND I'VE CALLED
YOU HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

43:41.850 --> 43:43.374
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
ANSWER YOUR DOOR.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.619
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

43:45.720 --> 43:49.053
I THOUGHT YOU COULD,
YOU KNOW...

43:49.160 --> 43:50.980
TAKE A HINT.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.725
OH.

43:55.630 --> 43:57.154
OKAY.

44:09.380 --> 44:11.507
- MISS CHENOWITH.
- BRENDA.

44:11.610 --> 44:13.976
- JACKIE.
- HI.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.241
- HI, HAVE A SEAT PLEASE.
- THANK YOU.

44:16.350 --> 44:19.342
I TYPICALLY AWARD
THIS INTERNSHIP TO MY MOST
PROMISING STUDENT.

44:19.450 --> 44:22.157
BUT APPARENTLY SOMEBODY
PULLED SOME STRINGS SOMEWHERE

44:22.260 --> 44:25.354
AND IT'S TO GO TO YOU NOW,
SO I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.955
WE HAVE OVER 17,000
STUDENTS HERE

44:29.060 --> 44:32.291
FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ETHNIC
AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.561
QUITE A FEW OF THEM END UP
HERE NEEDING OUR HELP.

44:34.670 --> 44:37.059
- I UNDERSTAND.
- WE DEAL WITH EVERYTHING

44:37.170 --> 44:39.559
FROM EATING DISORDERS
TO DEPRESSION

44:39.670 --> 44:41.661
TO STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS.
YOU NAME IT.

44:41.780 --> 44:44.271
IT'S NOT A WALK
IN THE PARK.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.705
ARE YOU READY FOR THAT?

44:47.810 --> 44:51.143
- YEAH, I THINK I'LL MANAGE.
- HMM.

44:51.250 --> 44:54.378
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- IT SAYS YOU SPEAK
A SECOND LANGUAGE.

44:54.490 --> 44:56.253
YES. FRENCH.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.918
AH, GREAT.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.955
WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE
FROM FR_ANCE HERE.
( snickers )

45:06.630 --> 45:08.188
HI.

45:08.300 --> 45:11.133
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL FIRST.
I WAS JUST DRIVING BY.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.559
COME IN.

45:12.670 --> 45:14.831
(TV playing
in distance)

45:18.540 --> 45:20.974
HEY, UH, DO YOU THINK

45:21.080 --> 45:23.913
I CAN TAKE THE KIDS
OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT?

45:24.020 --> 45:26.386
RICO, YOU CAN'T KEEP
CHANGING DAYS ON ME.

45:27.320 --> 45:29.413
I'M SORRY.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.613
FORGET IT.

45:31.720 --> 45:34.257
WHAT HAPPENED TO SHARON?
DID YOU FIND HER?

45:34.360 --> 45:36.396
SHE DIED.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.425
OH MY GOD, RICO.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.497
YEAH.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.500
YEAH, SHE DIED.

45:45.610 --> 45:47.760
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SHE HAD A HEART THING.

45:47.870 --> 45:50.930
I FOUND HER
IN HER APARTMENT.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.409
BABY, THAT'S SO AWFUL.

45:54.510 --> 45:56.740
I'M SO SORRY.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.945
I'M STILL KIND OF REELING
FROM IT.

46:01.050 --> 46:03.382
- YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

46:03.490 --> 46:05.219
IT'S SO SUDDEN.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.218
WELL, TAKE THE BOYS
OUT FOR PIZZA.

46:07.330 --> 46:09.594
YOU NEED THEM WITH YOU.
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

46:09.700 --> 46:12.328
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
CAN COME TOO?

46:13.330 --> 46:14.729
OF COURSE.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.365
OF COURSE.
JUST GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.472
( soft music playing )

46:30.720 --> 46:32.585
HEY.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.113
FINISH YOUR LESSON PLANS
ALREADY?

46:35.220 --> 46:36.687
AH, NO.

46:36.790 --> 46:40.180
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
THE ENERGY FOR IT.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.061
I'M WORKING ON
A NEW IDEA.

46:52.070 --> 46:54.561
YEAH, I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE COLLAGE STUFF.

46:54.670 --> 46:58.401
BUT ON A MUCH
BIGGER SCALE.

46:58.510 --> 47:01.445
NOT JUST PEOPLE AS FRAGMENTS
GLUED TOGETHER,

47:01.550 --> 47:04.474
BUT, LIKE, THE WHOLE WORLD.

47:06.020 --> 47:07.578
WELL, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

47:07.690 --> 47:11.512
YEAH, SORT OF CAPTURE
THE IDEA

47:11.620 --> 47:15.397
THAT EVERYTHING
WE KNOW IS JUST BARELY
BEING HELD TOGETHER.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.491
WOW.

47:22.600 --> 47:23.999
- THAT'S BIG.
- I KNOW.

47:24.100 --> 47:27.365
- IT'S BIG.
IT'S REALLY BIG.
- YEAH!

47:27.470 --> 47:29.370
HUH.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.368
I'M JUST TRYING TO--

47:31.480 --> 47:35.109
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT.

47:35.220 --> 47:38.314
WELL, I'LL LET YOU
KEEP WORKING THEN.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.193
SO HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK TO CLAIRE YET?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.633
WELL, YES.
YESTERDAY.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.564
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

48:00.670 --> 48:03.230
I WANTED
TO GIVE HER ANOTHER DAY
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.440
- AND?
- SHE WON'T DO IT.

48:07.550 --> 48:10.940
- SERIOUS?
- SHE'S STRONGLY AGAINST IT.

48:11.050 --> 48:15.350
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- IS IT, THOUGH?

48:15.460 --> 48:18.918
SOMETIMES I THINK
WHAT'S WEIRD IS US TRYING
TO CREATE OUR OWN CHILD.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.588
WE'RE TWO MEN, KEITH.
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

48:20.690 --> 48:22.999
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A CHILD

48:23.100 --> 48:25.091
THAT'S BOTH
PART ME AND PART YOU.

48:25.200 --> 48:28.692
- I KNOW THAT, DAVID.
- THEN LET'S STOP PRETENDING.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.099
WHETHER WE HAVE A CHILD
THROUGH A SURROGATE
OR WE ADOPT A CHILD,

48:32.210 --> 48:35.099
ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THE CHILD ITSELF.

48:37.410 --> 48:38.672
OKAY.

48:38.780 --> 48:41.078
- REALLY?
- OF COURSE.

48:41.180 --> 48:43.375
( sighs )
LOOK...

48:43.480 --> 48:46.244
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE SELFISH
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

48:46.350 --> 48:49.808
AND I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING GREATER

48:49.920 --> 48:52.024
THAN BEING ABLE TO LOOK
AT OUR CHILD

48:52.130 --> 48:55.190
AND SEE YOU IN HIM.
OR SEE YOU IN HER.

48:56.530 --> 48:58.452
HOPEFULLY YOU STILL WILL.

49:00.270 --> 49:02.864
IT WAS SUCH
A SHORT VISIT, MAGGIE.

49:02.970 --> 49:04.392
I WISH YOU
COULD STAY LONGER.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.832
THAT'S THE GOOD
AND THE BAD PART
OF MY JOB--

49:06.940 --> 49:09.033
I'M NEVER
ANYWHERE VERY LONG.

49:09.140 --> 49:11.608
VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE?

49:11.710 --> 49:13.746
I'D LIKE THE NEAPOLITAN.

49:13.850 --> 49:15.511
WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.679
OF COURSE WE DO.

49:19.890 --> 49:22.450
- I HAD SOME YESTERDAY.
- YES AND NOW WE'RE
OUT OF IT.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.881
HOW CAN WE BE OUT OF IT?
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE!
NEAPOLITAN!

49:24.990 --> 49:27.686
DADDY, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A LITTLE VANILLA
AND A LITTLE CHOCOLATE?

49:27.790 --> 49:30.020
- IT'S ALMOST THE SAME THING.
- NO, IT IS NOT THE SAME!

49:30.130 --> 49:32.519
NEAPOLITAN IS CHOCOLATE,
VANILLA AND STRAWBERRY!

49:32.630 --> 49:36.498
IF THERE'S NO STRAWBERRY
IT MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT
NEAPOLITAN!

49:36.600 --> 49:38.568
YOU SEE
WHAT I GO THROUGH?

49:39.940 --> 49:43.307
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST...

49:43.410 --> 49:47.574
MY LIFE IS
SO GODDAMNED PATHETIC.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.444
ALL I HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD
TO IS A FUCKING BOWL
OF ICE CREAM.

49:50.550 --> 49:52.984
( shouts )
AND I CAN'T EVEN GET THAT!

49:58.660 --> 50:00.719
I'M SORRY.

50:00.830 --> 50:02.695
I'M TRYING NOT
TO BE DEMANDING.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.597
IT'S JUST...

50:04.700 --> 50:07.191
OH, MY LIFE IS SHIT!

50:08.730 --> 50:11.130
I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.003
IT'S LIKE HAVING
ANOTHER CHILD.

50:20.250 --> 50:22.514
IT'S OKAY, DADDY.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.580
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

50:27.690 --> 50:29.487
WILL IT REALLY?

50:31.490 --> 50:34.357
MAGGIE,
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

50:34.460 --> 50:37.588
I'M NOT SURE I CAN
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

50:37.700 --> 50:40.066
IF YOU LEAVE TOMORROW,
MAGGIE, I JUST--

50:42.740 --> 50:44.435
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

50:49.010 --> 50:51.331
MAYBE I CAN STAY
A LITTLE LONGER.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.544
( sobbing )

51:30.780 --> 51:34.147
( toilet flushes )

51:50.070 --> 51:54.234
( rock music playing )

51:59.080 --> 52:02.208
* I FOUND
A PICTURE OF YOU *

52:03.150 --> 52:05.072
* OH OH OH OH OH

52:05.190 --> 52:09.559
* WHAT WOULD HIJACK
MY WORLD AT NIGHT *

52:11.320 --> 52:14.983
* TO A PLACE IN THE PAST
WE'D BEEN CAST OUT OF? *

52:15.090 --> 52:17.650
* OH OH OH OH OH

52:19.100 --> 52:21.762
* NOW WE'RE BACK
IN THE FIGHT *

52:23.540 --> 52:26.668
* WE'RE BACK
ON THE TRAIN *

52:26.770 --> 52:29.273
* OOH AH!

52:29.380 --> 52:34.408
* OOH, BACK ON
THE CHAIN GANG. *
