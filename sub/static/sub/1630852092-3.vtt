00:02.869 --> 00:04.670
<i>[woman] My food addiction
is killing me.</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:06.872
<i>And I know it's now or never.</i>

00:06.874 --> 00:08.340
<i>If I don't get the
help that I need,</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.042
<i>I'm gonna die.</i>

00:16.216 --> 00:19.418
[woman 2 tearfully] <i>Somewhere
in me it's this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.420 --> 00:22.054
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:23.423 --> 00:24.957
[breathing heavily]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.135
You can't do it and
then I just... man.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.371
<i>If I don't make a change now
I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:45.277
[groaning]

00:45.612 --> 00:46.812
It hurts!

00:46.814 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman3] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.216
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:57.190 --> 00:58.557
I'd like to get better
for my kids.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.527
It's not right for you want
me to put my life on hold,

01:01.529 --> 01:04.196
my health on hold for you.
That's not right.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.089
<i>[Bianca] I let me weight get
to the point where</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:32.057
<i>every day is a
struggle for me now.</i>

01:34.194 --> 01:36.328
<i>And it takes a lot of effort
for me to get ready for the day.</i>

01:37.730 --> 01:40.132
<i>Even the basics of what
I have to do is hard for me.</i>

01:41.801 --> 01:44.369
<i>I usually start by
getting cleaned up</i>

01:44.371 --> 01:46.972
<i>and putting lotion on my body.</i>

01:46.974 --> 01:49.374
<i>And in the areas there's
gonna be friction for me,</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:51.810
<i>because of how my body is now.</i>

01:51.812 --> 01:57.282
<i>And that wears me out
even before my day has begun.</i>

01:59.552 --> 02:03.155
<i>So I have to stop and rest
while I'm getting ready.</i>

02:04.691 --> 02:09.161
The most difficult part of
my day is my hygiene routine.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.866
<i>That makes me feel ashamed
that I have gotten to that point.</i>

02:13.868 --> 02:16.368
<i>But that's how it is for me.</i>

02:16.370 --> 02:18.403
<i>So I struggle
through getting ready,</i>

02:18.405 --> 02:21.006
<i>and then I have to
rest up before getting up.</i>

02:23.610 --> 02:27.279
<i>The pain in my body now
is almost unbearable.</i>

02:28.848 --> 02:31.550
<i>It's just the cost of
being this size now.</i>

02:31.552 --> 02:32.684
[groans]

02:32.686 --> 02:36.121
<i>But it makes me sad
'cause I have two young kids.</i>

02:36.123 --> 02:38.457
<i>Simeon, who's five, and
Marcia who's almost two.</i>

02:38.459 --> 02:40.025
[grunts]

02:40.092 --> 02:43.829
<i>And I wanna get up and go see
them first thing each morning, but I cant.</i>

02:43.831 --> 02:46.565
<i>I have to rely on my boyfriend
Romonte to check on them,</i>

02:46.567 --> 02:50.002
<i>since it's just such a
struggle for me to get going.</i>

02:53.773 --> 02:58.911
[Romonte] <i>Bianca's weight
has really affected the household,</i>

02:58.913 --> 03:02.314
kind of because big daddy
gotta do everything.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.383
I'm sick of it, really.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.818
<i>She needs to get it together.
We need to get it together.</i>

03:06.820 --> 03:08.487
<i>Because I need my help-mate.</i>

03:08.489 --> 03:11.957
I'm a old man. She's young.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.960
<i>But, she's not that
active person she used to be.</i>

03:14.994 --> 03:16.061
[grunts]

03:16.063 --> 03:17.229
[whispers] Jesus.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.730
[exhales]

03:18.898 --> 03:21.066
<i>Romonte's had to do
more and more for us.</i>

03:21.068 --> 03:22.568
<i>Because of how I struggle.</i>

03:22.570 --> 03:24.770
<i>And I feel bad for that.</i>

03:24.772 --> 03:27.272
<i>'Cause all of that shouldn't
be on him as much as it is.</i>

03:27.274 --> 03:29.575
<i>Sometime my cousin Neethie
is able to come over</i>

03:29.577 --> 03:32.978
<i>and lend a hand, but most of
the time it falls on Romonte.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:36.281
Because I'm not able to
walk for long periods of time.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.818
<i>And when I move, I move slow.</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:42.221
<i>Due to my pain in
my back and my knees.</i>

03:44.424 --> 03:46.658
Ooh, Jesus. Oh!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.727
[Romonte] It's kinda
rough this morning.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.395
- I know, baby, I--
- It's kind of real rough.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.830
[sighing in exhaustion]

03:55.702 --> 03:57.869
<i>[Bianca] When I have to
use the bathroom,</i>

03:57.871 --> 04:00.606
<i>I leave the door open
so Romonte can hear me</i>

04:00.608 --> 04:02.007
<i>in case I need him.</i>

04:02.009 --> 04:04.876
<i>That's the most
humiliating time for me</i>

04:04.878 --> 04:06.511
<i>when I need help like that.</i>

04:06.513 --> 04:08.513
<i>So I try to operate on my own.</i>

04:08.515 --> 04:10.549
<i>Because that type
of help is something</i>

04:10.551 --> 04:13.085
<i>I don't wanna burden
anyone else with.</i>

04:14.621 --> 04:18.023
<i>But what helps me with all
this struggle and pain is</i>

04:18.025 --> 04:20.626
<i>the smell of what's coming
when I know I'm gonna eat.</i>

04:20.628 --> 04:22.894
<i>Because food has become
the cause of my pain,</i>

04:22.896 --> 04:25.030
<i>but also the solution to it.</i>

04:26.399 --> 04:27.799
Is it almost done, baby?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.735
<i>[Romonte] ♪ It's ready, baby ♪</i>

04:29.737 --> 04:30.969
I'm hungry.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.739
<i>So, every morning
I can't wait to eat.</i>

04:33.741 --> 04:34.940
<i>And Romonte is good cook,</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:38.143
<i>so I look forward to
everything he makes.</i>

04:38.145 --> 04:39.878
<i>He tries to get me to eat right.</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:42.180
<i>You know, we've both
had weight loss surgery.</i>

04:42.182 --> 04:44.850
<i>And mine failed and his didn't.</i>

04:44.852 --> 04:47.085
<i>So we have
food struggles together.</i>

04:47.087 --> 04:49.821
<i>And he wants me to
lose wight to be healthy.</i>

04:49.823 --> 04:50.389
[sighs wearily]

04:52.025 --> 04:53.058
[grunts]

04:54.394 --> 04:56.228
Oh!

04:56.230 --> 05:00.198
<i>And when it comes to food,
it's my comfort and my addiction.</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.367
<i>And it's been hard
for me to give that up.</i>

05:03.102 --> 05:04.703
Whoo! Mmm.

05:04.705 --> 05:05.570
[Romonte] Kids, y'all full, too.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.406
Where my syrup at, baby?

05:07.408 --> 05:10.042
- It'll come, baby. You know, I got you a whole tub of it.
- Mmm.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.276
There you go.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.345
- You got a tub of syrup.
- Whoo!

05:13.646 --> 05:15.747
Yes, yes, yes.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.817
<i>Food is something that always
had a way to make me feel better.</i>

05:18.819 --> 05:20.919
<i>No matter what it is
I'm facing in my life</i>

05:20.921 --> 05:22.387
<i>or what I'm dealing with.</i>

05:22.389 --> 05:24.423
<i>It makes the pain go away.</i>

05:25.758 --> 05:28.560
<i>It just turns things
around like I need.</i>

05:28.562 --> 05:30.996
<i>And it's always been
the comfort that I need.</i>

05:30.998 --> 05:32.631
Baby, there's some
more pancakes left?

05:32.633 --> 05:33.965
No. No, ain't no more.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.034
You ain't getting no more.
It's over.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.769
- [Simeon speaks indistinctly]
- Mm-hmm.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.304
Mm-mmm. Eat your food, baby.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.007
- Mmm.
- [Romonte] Please slow down.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.408
- Slow down?
- Yeah.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.843
For what?

05:45.111 --> 05:47.412
<i>I don't wanna stop
because when I eat</i>

05:47.414 --> 05:49.448
I feel peace, I feel joy.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.949
I feel happiness.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.552
But then when I'm done eating,
that's when I get depressed

05:53.554 --> 05:54.920
<i>and the sadness sets in.</i>

05:54.922 --> 05:57.656
<i>Of, "Why did I do
this to my body again?"</i>

05:57.658 --> 06:00.125
<i>And then to try to
fill that void of guilt</i>

06:00.127 --> 06:01.393
<i>I usually take another bite.</i>

06:01.928 --> 06:04.029
Last bite, baby. Going in.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.097
- Look, baby.
- [Romonte] No.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.798
Baby, look. Look.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.265
[growls happily]

06:07.267 --> 06:09.034
[chuckles]

06:12.739 --> 06:14.039
Whoo!

06:14.407 --> 06:15.941
It's so hard for me
to stop eating

06:15.943 --> 06:18.744
because it's something that
was instilled in me as a child.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.912
- [Simeon] Done?
- I'm done, baby.

06:20.946 --> 06:21.813
[Romonte] You get enough?

06:21.815 --> 06:24.249
- I'm ready for lunch.
- I bet you are.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.924
<i>[Bianca] Food has always
been a comfort to me.</i>

06:32.926 --> 06:36.194
<i>And that started for me very
early on because of my mother.</i>

06:37.764 --> 06:41.400
<i>She struggled with alcohol,
and when she was drinking,</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:42.701
<i>she would get me food
to keep me quiet</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:45.070
<i>so she could go
and drink her liquor.</i>

06:46.472 --> 06:47.973
<i>You know, I didn't
know better at the time.</i>

06:47.975 --> 06:50.375
<i>And in a lot of ways
she was a good mom.</i>

06:51.577 --> 06:53.945
<i>She gave me the
best of everything.</i>

06:53.947 --> 06:56.481
<i>She took good care of me, made
sure I had clean clothes and everything.</i>

06:56.483 --> 06:57.982
<i>A roof over my head.</i>

06:57.984 --> 07:01.420
<i>But I just dealt with my mom
drinking every night and stuff.</i>

07:02.922 --> 07:05.957
<i>Most nights, when she
got drunk and passed out,</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.526
<i>I would eat as much as I wanted.</i>

07:07.528 --> 07:10.061
<i>And so I started
putting on a lot of weight,</i>

07:10.063 --> 07:12.597
<i>and got up to 200 pounds
by the age of seven.</i>

07:12.599 --> 07:15.700
And my mom never put me
on a diet or restricted my food.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.270
<i>When I was 12 years old
I was 300 pounds.</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:20.705
<i>And I was diagnosed
with high blood pressure.</i>

07:20.707 --> 07:22.841
<i>It was upsetting
because I had to worry</i>

07:22.843 --> 07:24.776
<i>about taking my
high blood pressure pills.</i>

07:24.778 --> 07:27.412
<i>My self-esteem was low.</i>

07:27.414 --> 07:28.680
<i>'Cause I felt like
I wasn't good enough.</i>

07:28.682 --> 07:31.883
<i>I felt like I wasn't pretty
enough, because of my size.</i>

07:31.885 --> 07:34.419
<i>I went to the only thing that
I knew, that was food.</i>

07:37.557 --> 07:39.624
<i>At that time my mom got married.</i>

07:39.626 --> 07:42.994
<i>I was very happy
about my stepdad.</i>

07:42.996 --> 07:45.497
<i>Because I felt like I had a
parent around who I could trust</i>

07:45.499 --> 07:47.599
<i>when my mom went to drinking.</i>

07:47.601 --> 07:51.036
<i>But towards the end of high
school, my mom got very sick.</i>

07:51.038 --> 07:52.838
<i>She had developed something
called neuropathy.</i>

07:52.840 --> 07:56.408
<i>And she couldn't walk so
I had to start caring for her.</i>

07:56.410 --> 07:58.176
<i>But it was hard for
me as a teenager.</i>

07:58.178 --> 08:00.779
<i>Because shortly after
my mom got sick,</i>

08:00.781 --> 08:02.280
<i>my stepdad died.</i>

08:03.816 --> 08:06.685
<i>'Cause my dad died in 2005.</i>

08:06.687 --> 08:09.888
<i>My stepdad died in 2006
and then my mom died in 2009.</i>

08:09.890 --> 08:11.823
<i>She died of cardiac arrest.</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:15.093
<i>I felt like a part of me died.
I felt alone.</i>

08:15.728 --> 08:17.295
<i>I didn't have anybody else.</i>

08:18.130 --> 08:19.798
I went into a deep depression.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.466
And I just ate and ate.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.403
And the pounds just piled on
and piled on and piled on.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.607
<i>After high school I decided to
become a registered nurse.</i>

08:28.609 --> 08:31.977
<i>I got a job caregiving,
and I did well at it.</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:34.913
<i>But when my mom died I just
spiraled out of control.</i>

08:34.915 --> 08:37.115
Because I just ate, ate,
and ate and ate.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.185
<i>That was a hard time.</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:42.921
<i>With my weight still increasing
I had to stop doing my job.</i>

08:42.923 --> 08:44.990
<i>At that time...</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:47.058
<i>that's when I met
Simeon's father.</i>

08:48.794 --> 08:50.128
Thank you, babe.
[sighs wearily]

08:50.863 --> 08:52.964
[exhales] Ooh!

08:53.799 --> 08:55.901
<i>I would say the first
few years were good.</i>

08:55.903 --> 08:57.903
<i>I got pregnant with my son.</i>

08:57.905 --> 09:00.639
<i>And then after that's when
I went through emotional,</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:03.174
and physical abuse
with my son's dad.

09:04.844 --> 09:08.413
<i>He started to go to alcohol
and he started to get drunk.</i>

09:08.415 --> 09:11.016
<i>And he started
just cussing, spitting.</i>

09:11.018 --> 09:13.618
<i>And then, when I was about
five month's pregnant,</i>

09:13.620 --> 09:14.986
<i>he got violent.</i>

09:15.755 --> 09:17.756
<i>But after that happened, I left.</i>

09:17.758 --> 09:21.126
<i>Then had Simeon
on my own when I was 27.</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:23.728
<i>And when Simeon was three,
I had a gastric sleeve</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.330
<i>and started to lose some weight.</i>

09:27.066 --> 09:29.334
<i>But unfortunately
I ended up gaining it back.</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:30.936
<i>So, that didn't last long.</i>

09:30.938 --> 09:34.973
<i>That started when I was pregnant
with my second child, with Romonte.</i>

09:36.943 --> 09:39.344
Whoa, look at that bread.
Uh-uh-uh.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.212
Butter bread!

09:41.214 --> 09:45.717
I met Bianca on
a gastric sleeve chat.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.519
<i>Both of us just had the surgery.</i>

09:47.521 --> 09:51.756
<i>Mine was real complicated,
I suffered a lot.</i>

09:51.758 --> 09:54.426
And she was there to comfort
me and we talked a lot.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.094
[Bianca] Come here, Marcia.

09:57.997 --> 10:02.334
<i>Monte was funny and caring
and that's what attracted me to him.</i>

10:02.336 --> 10:05.270
[Romonte] <i>When we first got
together Bianca was pretty plump.</i>

10:06.205 --> 10:10.208
<i>Got smaller and smaller,
then she gave me a baby.</i>

10:10.610 --> 10:12.777
<i>And now she's back plump.</i>

10:12.779 --> 10:16.815
<i>And she gave up her weight
loss journey to have a child.</i>

10:16.817 --> 10:19.284
<i>So, she sacrificed herself.</i>

10:20.586 --> 10:22.587
I got pregnant with my daughter.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.656
Then started back
picking up bad habits.

10:24.658 --> 10:28.760
<i>So, that's when started back
drinking sodas and eating chips and...</i>

10:28.762 --> 10:31.696
<i>And because of that I gained
all the weight back I lost.</i>

10:31.698 --> 10:34.399
<i>But now I'm back to being
around 600 pounds.</i>

10:36.002 --> 10:38.036
And let me get about
four or five toasts.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.338
[Romonte] I got you.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.908
<i>♪ Mama mia, mama mia
Mama hmm, hmm ♪</i>

10:43.910 --> 10:47.145
Stop the antics, please, and
just come over with my stuff.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.913
Girl, I know you want
mayo and hot sauce soon.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.116
No, I don't want no hot sauce,
I just want ranch.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.684
- You want ranch, hold on.
- Yeah.

10:52.686 --> 10:56.988
<i>The worst part is that my
weight makes me less of a mom.</i>

10:56.990 --> 11:00.759
<i>And it's just hard because
I'm not able to walk much.</i>

11:00.761 --> 11:03.528
<i>My weight has impacted my family</i>

11:03.530 --> 11:07.732
by not allowing me to interact
with my kids like I want to.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.468
<i>And I can't take care of them
like they deserve.</i>

11:10.470 --> 11:12.170
[Romonte] My hands washed.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.738
Okay, come on, you gotta
make your way to the table now.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.807
Whoo! Whoosh.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.842
<i>You know I contribute to
the income in the house,</i>

11:17.844 --> 11:19.911
<i>because I work a couple
of days out of the week</i>

11:19.913 --> 11:21.646
<i>at a call center,</i>

11:21.648 --> 11:24.282
<i>where I can sit
and stay put all day.</i>

11:25.384 --> 11:27.986
<i>But when it comes
to being a mom,</i>

11:27.988 --> 11:29.888
<i>you can't do that from a chair.</i>

11:29.890 --> 11:33.058
<i>You have to be active
to take care of the kids.</i>

11:33.292 --> 11:36.294
<i>But I can't do that now.</i>

11:36.296 --> 11:41.032
<i>So Monte has to pick up the
slack for me for a lot of things.</i>

11:41.767 --> 11:42.434
[grunts]

11:42.968 --> 11:44.502
[Romonte] All right!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.738
- Here, baby.
- Ooh.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.742
<i>We both take care of the kids but
he does most of the hands-on things,</i>

11:50.744 --> 11:52.677
<i>'cause I'm not able to
take care of them like that.</i>

11:52.679 --> 11:53.912
<i>And it's hard for me.</i>

11:53.914 --> 11:56.881
<i>Because my kids
don't deserve that.</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:59.851
My son didn't sign up to
have a mom like me.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.919
You know,
yes, I provide for him,

12:00.921 --> 12:02.587
yes, I'm a good mom to him,

12:02.589 --> 12:04.989
but he didn't sign up to
have an obese mom.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.057
<i>My daughter didn't
either but she's</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:08.960
<i>not old enough to
understand, but he is.</i>

12:09.061 --> 12:10.295
<i>So I wanna change.</i>

12:10.596 --> 12:11.696
I have to change.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.332
<i>But it's hard for me
to stop eating.</i>

12:14.334 --> 12:17.569
<i>Because the world of food in
my life right now is a comforter.</i>

12:17.571 --> 12:21.940
<i>When I have a let down I go to
food, I feel like it cures all of it.</i>

12:21.942 --> 12:25.376
It helps me emotionally and I
don't know how to stop myself.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.214
- Here, give me a bite.
- Hell no. Here.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.582
- Ah!
- Ah.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.951
[Romonte] Okay, go eat that.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.387
It bothers me because I...
She was so perky.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.123
So energetic.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.426
<i>But now, she's not that
active person she used to be.</i>

12:43.796 --> 12:45.196
<i>Can you imagine...</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:48.566
being a Arabian horse.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.735
Strong, ready to run.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.037
But you're stuck in the
body of an elephant.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.907
<i>Bianca's like that.</i>

12:55.909 --> 12:59.978
<i>I know she wants to be that
vibrant woman that can move around.</i>

12:59.980 --> 13:02.113
<i>But right now...</i>

13:02.414 --> 13:04.115
<i>she can't stand up and cook.</i>

13:04.117 --> 13:07.652
She can't stand up and wash
no dishes, I know that much.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.154
<i>And that ain't cool.</i>

13:09.555 --> 13:11.923
<i>So, I know she struggle,</i>

13:11.925 --> 13:14.659
<i>but she takes real good
care of her kids.</i>

13:14.661 --> 13:16.995
You know, I know for a fact

13:16.997 --> 13:21.199
<i>when she lose this weight
this time, she can do what it do.</i>

13:21.767 --> 13:23.935
<i>But, it's time to move.</i>

13:23.937 --> 13:25.904
<i>You know? It's time.</i>

13:25.938 --> 13:27.205
It's time.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.974
- It's full, baby.
- Okay, babe.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.276
Thank you.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.144
Let me get one more little bite.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.279
[Romonte] Okay.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.248
[children mumble]

13:37.250 --> 13:41.920
<i>I'm scared because of the
hold that food has over me.</i>

13:41.922 --> 13:45.156
It had a poison in my body
every day with the food I put in it.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.592
<i>What scares me
the worst right now</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:49.727
is dying and leaving
my kids motherless.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.730
That scares the
living daylights out of me.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.567
<i>Them having the burden of
trying to figure out this life</i>

13:55.569 --> 13:58.636
<i>alone without me,
without any life lessons.</i>

13:58.638 --> 14:00.638
<i>And not being able to
meet my grandkids</i>

14:00.640 --> 14:04.375
because I was too selfish
to put down that snack.

14:04.377 --> 14:08.613
<i>That I could be selfish and
leave them prematurely.</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:11.983
<i>And I wanna change now because
I don't wanna leave them</i>

14:11.985 --> 14:13.885
<i>to make to make memories
of someone else.</i>

14:13.887 --> 14:14.886
[sighs wearily]

14:14.920 --> 14:16.287
[breathing heavily]

14:20.693 --> 14:23.394
My weight has hindered me
for so many years.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.130
I don't want, every time I go
somewhere, to worry about,

14:26.132 --> 14:27.932
"Do they have the right
accommodation for me?"

14:27.934 --> 14:29.400
I want to actually live,

14:29.402 --> 14:31.402
instead of just being alive,
I want to live.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.906
<i>But I can't as long as
I'm addicted to food.</i>

14:34.908 --> 14:37.542
Because my food addiction
is killing me.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.177
And I know it's now or never.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.346
<i>If I don't get the
help that I need,</i>

14:41.413 --> 14:42.747
<i>I'm gonna die.</i>

14:42.749 --> 14:45.817
<i>I don't think I would make it
another six months to a year.</i>

14:45.819 --> 14:50.889
I feel like at any moment,
that my heart could fail me.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.591
<i>And that could happen to me
without any warning</i>

14:53.593 --> 14:55.393
<i>like when my mom passed,
you know?</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:57.629
<i>There was no
warning signs or nothing.</i>

14:57.631 --> 15:00.064
My mom just died,
she just left me.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.874
<i>And I know that if I don't die,</i>

15:09.876 --> 15:11.843
<i>and I don't lose this weight,
I'll be bedridden</i>

15:11.845 --> 15:13.611
<i>and I'll end up in
a nursing home.</i>

15:13.613 --> 15:17.148
And I refuse to end up in
a nursing home or bedridden.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.985
I got you. I got...
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.790
<i>I know that Monte tries
to be strong for me.</i>

15:25.792 --> 15:27.892
<i>But I know deep down
inside he's scared.</i>

15:27.894 --> 15:29.761
<i>It scares him that he
might wake up to</i>

15:29.763 --> 15:31.763
<i>me being dead
in the bed one day.</i>

15:31.765 --> 15:34.966
<i>That he might have to
raise two kids by his self.</i>

15:35.701 --> 15:37.969
<i>So I have to do this now
and get help to change</i>

15:37.971 --> 15:40.772
<i>before that happens
and I don't make it.</i>

15:40.774 --> 15:43.741
<i>Because not gonna
be much longer...</i>

15:43.743 --> 15:46.144
<i>I can't live like this
much longer.</i>

15:59.692 --> 16:01.592
Baby, do you got
everything you need?

16:01.594 --> 16:02.794
[Romonte] Yeah, pretty much.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.629
Can you come in here,
kinda help me finish packing?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.130
Yeah, I'm coming, baby.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.832
<i>Romonte's gonna take me
down to Houston</i>

16:07.834 --> 16:09.667
<i>to have an appointment
with Dr. Now</i>

16:09.669 --> 16:11.703
<i>to see if he can
help me lose weight.</i>

16:11.705 --> 16:12.971
<i>And have
weight loss surgery again</i>

16:12.973 --> 16:14.906
<i>since my first one failed.</i>

16:14.908 --> 16:16.908
Is there anything else you need?

16:16.975 --> 16:19.077
I don't know how
I'm gonna make it.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.311
- I'm so tired.
- You got all your clothes?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.812
No, almost.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.116
<i>[Bianca] But I know this trip is
gonna be a difficult one for me.</i>

16:25.584 --> 16:27.218
<i>I just need to pace myself.</i>

16:27.920 --> 16:29.954
Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.756
- [sighs wearily]
- Come on, now. Come on.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.257
- Oh. Mmm, my knees.
- Uh-huh.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.193
Ooh. [sighs wearily]

16:35.195 --> 16:36.294
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.096
[exhales]

16:38.230 --> 16:39.297
Oh, God.

16:39.698 --> 16:40.398
Oh!

16:40.400 --> 16:41.432
- Okay.
- You gotta...

16:41.434 --> 16:43.668
<i>[Bianca] I have
a lot of fears doing this.</i>

16:43.670 --> 16:47.071
<i>But I'm facing them.
And not letting them stop me.</i>

16:47.073 --> 16:51.142
<i>I just have to walk slow,
and take my steps carefully.</i>

16:51.144 --> 16:53.478
Let me put these shoes on
these old tender feet of yours.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.646
Okay, please do.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.683
<i>[Bianca] This is the last
option and hope I have.</i>

16:58.685 --> 17:01.219
<i>So if this doesn't work, I
don't know what I'm gonna do.</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:06.557
Okay. Hold on,
let me get this.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.959
Did you already pack
the food for the road?

17:07.961 --> 17:09.494
- Yeah, I got you plenty of snacks.
- Okay.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.864
- You know, your snacks took up half the bag.
- Okay.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.966
But I would like to stop to get
something to eat 'cause I'm hungry.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.367
I bet you are.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.903
- [grunts]
- Come on, why wouldn't you?

17:18.905 --> 17:20.138
- [Bianca exhales]
- Let's go.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.540
[sighs in exasperation]

17:24.610 --> 17:26.677
<i>[Bianca] This is gonna
be a long trip.</i>

17:26.679 --> 17:29.680
<i>We're leaving early enough
to make it in a day but,</i>

17:29.682 --> 17:31.382
<i>it's about
an 11 or a 12 hour drive.</i>

17:31.384 --> 17:32.517
We're gonna leave soon.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.951
Hmm. Come on.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.522
<i>I just had to see how long I
can handle the road at one time.</i>

17:37.524 --> 17:39.824
<i>And I think food,
unfortunately, has got to be</i>

17:39.826 --> 17:41.826
<i>a crutch I'm gonna have to
lean on to get through this trip.</i>

17:41.828 --> 17:43.928
<i>Especially down the road,</i>

17:43.930 --> 17:46.998
<i>when being in the car
starts to get tougher on me.</i>

17:47.933 --> 17:50.068
- Oh!
- Take your time.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.136
Take your time.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.339
[sighs wearily]

18:00.779 --> 18:01.612
There. Don't worry.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.147
[Romonte exhales]

18:03.916 --> 18:06.851
Girl, you got something on there.
You look pretty good. I'm proud of you.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.219
Tuck it in, you ready?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.755
Oop. One more time.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.389
Okay.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.758
Lord, have mercy.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.126
Let me get these kids.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.965
[Romonte grunts]

18:23.068 --> 18:24.368
All right. Ooh.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.070
Okay.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.371
Mmm.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.707
[Romonte grunts]

18:29.875 --> 18:31.809
- All the windows is--
- Ooh, baby. I'm tired.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.978
Let's just get some...
stop and get something to eat.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.313
Yeah, buddy.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.050
[Romonte] We got
a long way, baby.

18:39.052 --> 18:42.019
[Bianca] I know, baby.
I just hope I can make it.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.054
[Romonte] I know you can.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.390
But the main thing here,
you are on your way.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.359
- Yes.
- Yeah.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.394
And that's the
beautiful blessing of it all.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.396
It is. It is.

18:56.101 --> 18:59.537
<i>We have a very small car that I have
to have to have my seat so far back.</i>

18:59.539 --> 19:00.671
<i>The kids are cramped.</i>

19:00.673 --> 19:04.809
<i>I know I'm gonna have to drive
with pain and agony.</i>

19:04.811 --> 19:06.811
<i>I'm gonna have to start out by
getting something to eat.</i>

19:06.813 --> 19:07.812
[Bianca sighs]

19:07.814 --> 19:10.848
Mm-mmm, I just don't
feel good today.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.117
Maybe I'll feel better
if I get the food in me.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.685
[Romonte] I bet you will.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.824
<i>Right now I just feel so weak and
this hurt in my back and my knees.</i>

19:19.826 --> 19:24.395
<i>And to be quite honest the
ultimate pain reliever is when I eat.</i>

19:24.397 --> 19:25.863
Welcome to Jack's.
Can I take your order?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.565
[Bianca] Okay, can I get
the number three,

19:27.567 --> 19:29.834
the bigger Jack burger?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.670
And instead of a soda can I
get a strawberry milkshake?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.005
I want that large.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.808
And then also can I get
a chicken BLT with fries?

19:37.810 --> 19:40.077
And then I just want a big BLT.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.214
[Romonte] Also, give me
three cheeseburgers.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.783
A large order of fries.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.553
And four-piece chicken tender.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.855
<i>[Bianca] And the pain's only
gonna leave for a little bit.</i>

19:50.857 --> 19:52.657
<i>But after that,
and I'm hurting again...</i>

19:52.659 --> 19:54.392
[Romonte] Thank you so much.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.661
[woman] Thank you.
You have a great day.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.829
[Romonte] Think that's gonna
be enough to hold you up?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.131
[Bianca] Hopefully, baby.
Maybe for about two hours.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.398
[Romonte] I hope so.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.370
<i>[Bianca] Part of me feels like
these are my last meals.</i>

20:08.574 --> 20:11.309
<i>You know, I'm gonna get help
to change my addiction.</i>

20:16.148 --> 20:17.481
<i>So I don't go to food
for comfort like I do.</i>

20:17.483 --> 20:20.051
Mm-hmm. That was so good.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.955
<i>So this is my last chance to enjoy
what tastes good before that happens.</i>

20:23.957 --> 20:27.258
Oh, that's hit the spot, baby.
I already feel better.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.193
- Are you just starting?
- Yeah, I'm just starting.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.428
Okay.

20:33.632 --> 20:37.034
<i>These meals on the road to
Houston are my last like this.</i>

20:38.971 --> 20:40.972
<i>Because I'm ready to change.</i>

20:42.007 --> 20:42.673
[child whining]

20:42.675 --> 20:44.175
[Bianca] What?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.447
<i>Then when I finished eating,
the guilt set in.</i>

20:49.449 --> 20:51.148
<i>Of, "Why'd I put
things in my body</i>

20:51.150 --> 20:54.185
<i>that could prematurely
take me away from my kids?"</i>

21:11.003 --> 21:12.203
[Romonte grunts]

21:14.673 --> 21:16.040
[Bianca grunts]

21:16.608 --> 21:18.109
Now you got a long way to go.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.412
- Come on.
- [sighing in exhaustion]

21:22.447 --> 21:24.782
[continues sighing]

21:24.784 --> 21:27.818
- [Romonte speaks indistinctly]
- I'm about to sit down.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.287
- Hold on.
- Go on.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.056
Go on. There ain't nothing
I can do.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.891
[Romonte] Hmm.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.126
[sighing in exhaustion]

21:36.862 --> 21:38.229
[breathing heavily]

21:49.141 --> 21:50.408
[continues breathing heavily]

21:53.845 --> 21:54.979
Oh. [grunts]

21:54.981 --> 21:56.047
Oh. [exhales]

21:59.084 --> 22:00.418
You okay?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.320
Oh, my feet's so swollen.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.089
Oh.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.158
Oh.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.061
Oh.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.739
<i>[Bianca] I'm nervous about the
appointment, meeting Dr. Now.</i>

22:21.741 --> 22:24.975
<i>That he's gonna think
that my fat ways</i>

22:24.977 --> 22:27.278
<i>and my life,
is too much for him.</i>

22:29.715 --> 22:31.549
<i>Because of how it is.</i>

22:31.551 --> 22:33.050
<i>Because I choose to eat.</i>

22:33.052 --> 22:35.820
<i>Because I choose to be
overwhelmed by emotions.</i>

22:35.822 --> 22:38.189
<i>And just feed myself to death.</i>

22:39.725 --> 22:43.027
<i>I'm hopeful that he's gonna
get me on this program.</i>

22:43.029 --> 22:46.230
<i>But I'm more scared that
he's gonna tell me no.</i>

22:50.736 --> 22:51.402
You ready, baby?

22:51.404 --> 22:52.936
Is it a long walk?

22:53.839 --> 22:56.841
It's a strong walk.
It's not long but it's strong.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.309
That means you
gotta be strong, baby.

22:58.311 --> 22:59.477
Do you wanna get the kids first?

22:59.479 --> 23:02.012
- Yeah, I'm just gonna get the kids right now.
- Okay.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.314
[Romonte sighs]

23:05.083 --> 23:07.151
[Romonte coughs] Come on.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.153
Come on, let's go.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.222
I'm gonna leave you.
And you have to catch up.

23:11.656 --> 23:12.623
I gotta go.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.193
Come on, son.
Open the door for your mama.

23:16.628 --> 23:17.728
[groans]

23:17.730 --> 23:19.096
[Romonte] You gonna
stay with Mama?

23:22.601 --> 23:24.034
[breathing heavily]

23:42.721 --> 23:45.122
<i>At one point I thought
I wanted to turn around,</i>

23:45.124 --> 23:46.424
<i>that I wasn't gonna be
able to make it.</i>

23:50.829 --> 23:52.129
[breathing heavily]

23:55.901 --> 23:57.568
I'm not gonna make it, baby.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.903
I'm not gonna make it.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.805
Baby, you only got
a couple of more...

24:00.807 --> 24:02.973
You want me to put you on
and push you on this?

24:03.008 --> 24:04.675
I'll push you.
Here, come on.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.577
Hold the door, son.
Hold the door.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.878
Hold the door.
I'm gonna push you.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.414
So you can't take
these last five steps?

24:10.416 --> 24:14.051
And you wanted that good old
Louisiana chicken?

24:14.053 --> 24:16.020
Here you go. There you go.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.254
Ride the cart.

24:18.657 --> 24:19.556
Ride the cart.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.528
You came this far
you can't go that far.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.597
So you gonna give up every time.

24:26.599 --> 24:30.334
When Dr. Now tell you about,
"You can't eat this, you can't eat that."

24:30.336 --> 24:31.769
- You gonna give up?
- [Simeon] Move. Move.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.070
- You gonna give up?
- [Simeon] Move.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.805
[Romonte] Here. There you go.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.407
Whoa. Here, come. on.

24:36.409 --> 24:37.441
I gotta help you up.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.677
Come.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.378
You gotta...
Come on. Come now. Come on.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.414
- [gasps]
- Come on. Come on.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.749
- [whimpering] - Come on, you're
gonna have to get in. Come on.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.618
Hold on. I got to
get myself together.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.787
- You gonna sit right down?
- No.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.889
'Cause you sit right down, I'm
not gonna help you up this time,

24:51.891 --> 24:52.590
you'd likely kill me.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.091
Okay. Come on.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.928
Quick. There's a whole
bathroom in there somewhere.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.997
There's a whole bathroom.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.367
It's a good bathroom.
Come on, she can make it.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.140
Come on. Have yourself a seat.
Come on now.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.009
That's it.

25:12.410 --> 25:13.677
There you go.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.715
Don't know where I'm
gonna sleep but I'll be all right.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.584
<i>So, I'm worried about my
appointment with Dr. Now tomorrow.</i>

25:20.586 --> 25:23.420
<i>Because this is the
last shot I have.</i>

25:25.056 --> 25:27.825
<i>So, no matter what, tomorrow
I'm gonna get up and keep going.</i>

25:27.827 --> 25:29.693
Because I have to.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.762
<i>Because if I walk away
from this,</i>

25:31.764 --> 25:34.098
<i>my family could be
planning my funeral.</i>

25:49.414 --> 25:51.782
Curbed my appetite
for the rest of the day.

25:51.784 --> 25:52.983
- [Romonte coughs]
- I'm gonna lose some weight.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.251
[Romonte] Okay.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.787
<i>[Bianca] We're all in Houston.</i>

25:56.789 --> 25:58.822
<i>But it took us driving
over four hours straight</i>

25:58.824 --> 26:00.724
<i>to get here on time.</i>

26:00.726 --> 26:02.826
- [Romonte] We're here now.
- [Bianca] I'm nervous.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.029
Ah, don't be nervous now.

26:06.831 --> 26:07.998
[car beeping]

26:08.000 --> 26:10.401
- Come on, son.
- Go ahead and get up, Simeon.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.373
- Can I hold that for you, Mom?
- Okay, thank you.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.342
[Romonte] Come on.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.346
[Bianca grunts]

26:23.014 --> 26:24.081
All right.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.416
Now.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.085
Get on up and get out of here.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.154
Let's go.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.025
The queen has arrived!

26:37.429 --> 26:40.998
<i>I have a lot of fears that it's
not going to be possible for me</i>

26:41.000 --> 26:43.367
<i>to get another
weight loss surgery.</i>

26:45.804 --> 26:49.139
<i>Mainly because I've had one
weight loss surgery already.</i>

26:49.708 --> 26:50.741
Miss Hayes.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.745
<i>[Bianca] But I'm keeping
a positive outlook</i>

26:54.747 --> 26:56.313
<i>that this is gonna be something</i>

26:56.315 --> 26:58.849
<i>that's gonna give me
a second chance.</i>

26:58.851 --> 27:03.687
<i>On the road I said goodbye to the
foods that I crave to bring me comfort.</i>

27:03.689 --> 27:06.090
<i>But from here on out
I'm doing what I have to</i>

27:06.092 --> 27:08.993
<i>to succeed,
if I get this chance.</i>

27:08.995 --> 27:13.330
<i>Hopefully my starting point
isn't a lot higher than I expected.</i>

27:14.799 --> 27:16.467
[woman] Step up on
the scale, please.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.369
<i>I think I should be around 600.</i>

27:18.371 --> 27:21.138
<i>So, that's the range
I'm expected to be at today.</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:26.243
<i>But if the number that
comes up is higher,</i>

27:26.245 --> 27:29.313
<i>then that's gonna be a hard
moment for me when I see that.</i>

27:34.219 --> 27:35.419
Well, there it is.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.287
There you go.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.423
What you mean by that?

27:39.425 --> 27:41.158
There it is. There you go.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.527
You know what it is now.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.629
<i>I'm not happy about that weight.</i>

27:45.631 --> 27:49.600
<i>But I'm happy that it's not
higher than I was thinking.</i>

27:49.602 --> 27:53.003
<i>But I'm ashamed that I
let it get as high as it did.</i>

27:53.405 --> 27:55.339
<i>I know I did that to myself.</i>

27:56.408 --> 27:59.476
<i>And I'm praying that
Dr. Now can do something.</i>

27:59.478 --> 28:02.680
<i>Anything to help me change
that and to lose weight.</i>

28:02.682 --> 28:05.916
<i>Because if he gives me
the chance that I need,</i>

28:05.918 --> 28:09.420
<i>I'm ready to do whatever it
takes to get on that right track.</i>

28:09.954 --> 28:11.288
Close it on up.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.891
[Romonte] Come over here,
have a seat.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.026
Here's Bucky Beaver.
Here play with the Beaver.

28:20.398 --> 28:21.932
Hello, how you all doing?

28:21.934 --> 28:22.833
Fine. How are you?

28:22.900 --> 28:24.168
Good.

28:24.502 --> 28:28.005
- So, you must be Bianca?
- Yes, sir.

28:28.007 --> 28:32.876
All right, I'm Dr. Nowzaradan
and you come in all the way from

28:32.878 --> 28:35.145
- Fayetteville, Tennessee?
- Yes, sir.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.647
All right.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.215
Well, glad you're here.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.684
So, and who have
you got with you?

28:40.686 --> 28:44.722
I have my son Simeon, my daughter
Marcia and my boyfriend Romonte.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.558
It looks like the trip
left Marcia in a

28:47.560 --> 28:50.527
- tired and sleepy, huh?
- Yes, she is.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.631
So, tell me what brought you
down to Houston?

28:54.633 --> 28:57.067
Because I wanted to see if
I could get a second chance

28:57.069 --> 28:59.369
at life with
weight loss surgery.

28:59.504 --> 29:00.737
Okay.

29:00.839 --> 29:04.875
And you had weight loss
surgery about four years ago, huh?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.543
Yes. sir. I had
the gastric sleeve.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.979
And then what
happened after that?

29:08.981 --> 29:11.915
I got pregnant with my daughter
and fell back into old habits.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.517
Okay, explain that more.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.754
What do you mean
you fell on old habits?

29:16.756 --> 29:19.890
Sort of back eating slider
foods like chips, drinking soda.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.392
And my problem is I graze eat.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.428
Instead of eating a meal
I graze eat,

29:24.430 --> 29:27.564
and just pick all day and
put stuff in my mouth all day.

29:27.566 --> 29:30.801
Well, there's no operation
that's gonna correct that.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.704
So what's gonna be different
this time

29:33.706 --> 29:35.606
if you have a second chance?

29:35.608 --> 29:37.641
I need to go through therapy

29:37.643 --> 29:40.611
and get down to the root
of my emotional eating.

29:40.613 --> 29:43.714
Well, hold on. What do you
mean "emotional eating"?

29:43.716 --> 29:46.850
Um, I eat when I get upset,
when I get stressed.

29:46.852 --> 29:50.053
If you understand that,
then why haven't you gone

29:50.055 --> 29:52.589
to a therapy to address that
before now?

29:52.657 --> 29:53.790
I'm not sure.

29:54.092 --> 29:58.128
So we need to get you away
from giving yourself a pass

29:58.162 --> 29:59.563
to eat junk food.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.697
And that's typical,

30:00.699 --> 30:03.934
everybody overeats and
their eating disorder,

30:03.936 --> 30:06.804
and they call it, uh,
"Oh, I'm an emotional eater."

30:06.806 --> 30:10.407
Uh, "I'm happy I eat,
I'm sad I eat,"

30:10.409 --> 30:13.710
uh, to give a pass for them
to do that.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.746
But that's not reality.

30:15.748 --> 30:18.615
So, the first step
you're gonna need to take

30:18.617 --> 30:21.585
to show me a second chance
would be different for you

30:21.587 --> 30:24.388
is taking responsibility
for your eating,

30:24.390 --> 30:27.391
not making any more excuse
to yourself,

30:27.393 --> 30:28.759
and showing you're willing

30:28.761 --> 30:30.894
to put in the work
that it's gonna take

30:30.896 --> 30:32.729
to change your life.
You understand that?

30:32.731 --> 30:33.730
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

30:33.732 --> 30:36.700
Well, you know,
there is no second chance

30:36.702 --> 30:40.003
to get you successful unless
you discipline yourself.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.173
Surgery is not gonna
correct your eating disorder.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.875
- Okay.
<i>- You are the one</i>

30:44.877 --> 30:46.009
that need to do that.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.678
- Okay.
- Okay?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.112
Romonte, you're nodding,

30:49.114 --> 30:51.281
so you agree with me, huh?

30:51.283 --> 30:52.449
Yes, I do.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.185
That's good, so you can be
a support to her with that.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.387
But do not be her enabler,
all right?

30:57.722 --> 30:58.956
Uh-uh.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.124
Me... We both
had the surgery done

31:01.126 --> 31:02.860
around the same time.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.795
I lost the weight.

31:04.797 --> 31:07.064
She went back to her old ways.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.833
She really did. So...

31:09.835 --> 31:12.236
she's the only person
that could make this happen.

31:12.837 --> 31:13.770
You're right.

31:13.772 --> 31:14.905
We agree about that

31:14.907 --> 31:17.875
because we each
have to make the choices

31:17.877 --> 31:20.878
not to be unhealthy,
no matter what the excuse.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.812
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:21.814 --> 31:25.015
That is something
that is not easy,

31:25.017 --> 31:26.950
but it is something
you have to do

31:26.952 --> 31:28.986
if you want to save your life.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.988
- Yes, sir.
- So if you feel like

31:30.990 --> 31:32.689
you're ready to do this now,

31:32.691 --> 31:34.658
then what we can do to help you

31:34.660 --> 31:36.960
is give you some instructions
as a guide

31:36.962 --> 31:39.830
that will help you understand
what to do.

31:39.832 --> 31:42.065
But the choice to do it
is up to you.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.636
The first thing is going
to break down for you is

31:45.638 --> 31:47.671
a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet

31:47.673 --> 31:50.941
that focuses on protein,
not carbs.

31:50.943 --> 31:53.610
And I want you
to start that immediately.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.611
- Okay.
- Okay?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.914
And the instructions
will also have

31:56.916 --> 31:59.049
some exercises
for you to do every day.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.618
So how is your activity?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.921
Uh, my activity, it's okay.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.555
My back starts hurting and stuff

32:05.557 --> 32:07.024
when I get tired sometimes.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.559
But you get up and walk
and do things?

32:09.561 --> 32:10.794
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

32:10.796 --> 32:13.096
So, what we're gonna start
doing here is

32:13.098 --> 32:14.631
walk at least once
in the morning,

32:14.633 --> 32:15.866
once in the evening.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.669
If you do that, then you
should easily be able

32:18.671 --> 32:20.871
to make the goal
I'm gonna give you

32:20.873 --> 32:24.908
to lose 55 pounds
over the next two months.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.710
- Okay.
- Is that something

32:26.712 --> 32:27.744
you think you can do?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.680
Yes, I can do that.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.883
Okay, if you meet that goal,
then at that point,

32:32.885 --> 32:34.351
we're gonna see what option
we have for you,

32:34.353 --> 32:35.552
- okay?
- Okay.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.889
But if we move ahead with you,
you're gonna move to Houston

32:38.891 --> 32:42.859
if you want to do the program
since you live so far away.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.429
Is that something you think
you can do, too?

32:45.431 --> 32:46.630
I'll have to see.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.031
But I'll do whatever it takes

32:48.033 --> 32:50.434
because I'm about,
you know, saving my life.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.568
So I'll do it.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.237
But I guess it depends
on how soon I have to do that.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.741
Well, we'll see about that
after you make it to the goal.

32:57.743 --> 32:58.542
Okay.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.010
But if you just, um,

33:00.012 --> 33:02.879
go back and fall
to the same old habit,

33:02.881 --> 33:05.082
and you eat whatever, whenever,

33:05.084 --> 33:06.750
then there's not much
we can do for you.

33:06.752 --> 33:07.918
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:07.920 --> 33:10.754
So, there will be no point
in you moving down here

33:10.756 --> 33:12.823
- if that's the case, okay?
- Yes, sir.

33:12.825 --> 33:16.893
So right now, we give you
the tools to change,

33:16.895 --> 33:19.696
if you do that, then we're
gonna see what else we've got.

33:19.698 --> 33:20.964
Okay. All right.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.966
I'm gonna bring in some stuff,

33:22.968 --> 33:24.735
- and go work, okay?
- Okay.

33:24.737 --> 33:25.668
All right.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.808
We just thought we had it
worse, didn't we?

33:31.810 --> 33:33.610
The ball is in your court,

33:33.612 --> 33:36.046
it's been in your court
from the beginning.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.749
<i>[Dr. Now] It's always
a concern</i>

33:38.751 --> 33:41.752
if any patient looking
for weight loss surgery

33:41.754 --> 33:43.787
<i>has already had one and failed.</i>

33:43.789 --> 33:45.822
<i>In those situations,</i>

33:45.824 --> 33:47.557
<i>the chances of long-term success</i>

33:47.559 --> 33:49.593
are less than 1%.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.029
<i>Because they have already
been giving her tools</i>

33:52.031 --> 33:54.698
that took away
the physical drive to eat,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.099
<i>but they chose to continue,</i>

33:56.101 --> 33:57.901
<i>justifying their overeating,</i>

33:57.903 --> 33:59.836
hoping that the surgery

33:59.838 --> 34:01.905
<i>would magically fix everything
for them</i>

34:01.907 --> 34:03.874
<i>no matter what they did.</i>

34:03.876 --> 34:05.609
And usually, that justification

34:05.611 --> 34:08.545
<i>revolves around needing food
for comfort.</i>

34:08.547 --> 34:12.082
<i>Whether it's life situations
or a particular circle,</i>

34:12.084 --> 34:16.119
<i>that patient hasn't given up
the excuse of overeating,</i>

34:16.121 --> 34:18.488
and eating unhealthy food
to get through things.

34:18.490 --> 34:21.058
<i>And it's clear, that's
the case with Bianca,</i>

34:21.060 --> 34:24.294
because she was very ready
to offer up that excuse

34:24.296 --> 34:25.695
of emotional eating

34:25.697 --> 34:28.965
as the reason why
she undid her gastric sleeve.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.068
And gained all her weight back.

34:33.471 --> 34:34.604
All right.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.941
Now, this is what I want you
to read every day.

34:37.943 --> 34:40.777
- Okay.
- So let's go over that now.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.747
Long term, we're gonna need
to help Bianca

34:43.749 --> 34:47.417
<i>address the emotional issues
that drive her to eat.</i>

34:47.419 --> 34:49.419
But she needs
to take the first step

34:49.421 --> 34:50.720
<i>and show a willingness</i>

34:50.722 --> 34:53.723
<i>to take control
of her behavior and choices,</i>

34:53.725 --> 34:55.659
<i>because if she's not at a point</i>

34:55.661 --> 34:57.127
where she's gonna do that,

34:57.129 --> 34:58.829
<i>then no tool anyone gives her</i>

34:58.831 --> 35:02.165
is gonna make anything
but a temporary change.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.335
And the book,
this is the exercise chapter.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.103
Okay.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.105
So you start doing
those exercises

35:08.107 --> 35:09.639
an hour in the morning,

35:09.641 --> 35:11.408
an hour in the afternoon.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.810
So these are the starting point.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.646
- Okay.
- And if you follow this,

35:16.648 --> 35:19.583
and change your eating habit,
you should be able to lose

35:19.585 --> 35:23.053
at least 40 to 50 pounds
easily in one month.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.658
So if you're sticking
to the diet,

35:28.660 --> 35:31.428
there is no excuse for you
not to lose that.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.997
- Okay.
- Okay, so any questions?

35:33.999 --> 35:36.933
- No, sir. Thank you so much.
- All right.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.402
Let me leave that all with you,

35:39.404 --> 35:41.404
since she has her hands full.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.106
[Romonte] I'm gonna
read these myself.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.408
All right.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.077
"The scale does not lie."

35:47.079 --> 35:48.278
People do!

35:48.679 --> 35:50.147
Thank you.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.384
So this is gonna be
a starting point,

35:54.719 --> 35:56.119
and let's see

35:56.121 --> 35:58.788
if you can make
all those changes, okay?

35:58.790 --> 35:59.823
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.825
All right, nice
to meet you guys.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.627
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.228
- You all take care.
- [both] You too.

36:15.806 --> 36:16.773
<i>[Bianca] The appointment went</i>

36:16.775 --> 36:19.409
<i>better than I thought
it was gonna go.</i>

36:19.411 --> 36:20.777
<i>I was scared that there
wasn't gonna be</i>

36:20.779 --> 36:23.146
<i>a second chance for me.</i>

36:23.148 --> 36:24.648
<i>But I'm thankful
for what happened instead.</i>

36:24.650 --> 36:25.682
He basically just laid down
on the table

36:25.684 --> 36:27.350
He said the ball's in my court,

36:27.352 --> 36:31.821
and it's up to me to play it
the way that I want it.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.824
<i>The main thing that stood out
to me that he said was</i>

36:34.826 --> 36:36.793
I have to change
my eating habits.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.395
That's the only way
he's gonna be able to help me,

36:38.397 --> 36:40.230
<i>if I help myself first.</i>

36:40.765 --> 36:41.831
<i>And he said that, basically,</i>

36:41.833 --> 36:43.800
no weight loss surgery
was gonna help me

36:43.802 --> 36:45.702
if I don't get down to the root

36:45.704 --> 36:47.737
of why I just eat
just to be eating.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.607
<i>And hearing that
was a real wake-up call.</i>

36:50.609 --> 36:53.410
<i>Because if I think about it,
it makes sense to me</i>

36:53.412 --> 36:55.912
when he said that I'm just
making excuses to eat.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.515
<i>Because all my life, I've
just always have excuses</i>

36:58.517 --> 37:00.350
<i>to just eat and eat and eat.</i>

37:00.352 --> 37:01.851
<i>And now, I'm just ready
for a change.</i>

37:01.853 --> 37:04.487
<i>No matter if I did grow up
with an alcoholic mom,</i>

37:04.489 --> 37:05.956
<i>no matter what happened
to my life,</i>

37:05.958 --> 37:08.191
<i>what I put
into my mouth determines</i>

37:08.193 --> 37:09.793
<i>if I wanna live
or if I wanna die.</i>

37:09.795 --> 37:11.127
And at this point,

37:11.129 --> 37:13.330
I wanna eat to live,
not eat to die.

37:13.598 --> 37:14.864
<i>So no more excuses.</i>

37:14.866 --> 37:17.400
<i>I know what I need to do,
so I'm gonna go do it.</i>

37:17.402 --> 37:19.936
Because I'm determined
to do this.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.638
<i>Failure is not an option</i>

37:21.640 --> 37:23.340
unless I wanna be
six feet under.

37:42.426 --> 37:43.860
[Simeon] Right here beside you?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.428
Yeah, you can get
on this side of me.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.363
Stand right here.

37:47.698 --> 37:50.900
Okay, let's see what's first.

37:50.902 --> 37:51.901
<i>Since coming back
from my first appointment</i>

37:51.903 --> 37:53.637
<i>with Dr. Now,</i>

37:53.639 --> 37:55.038
<i>I reshaped
how I'm doing everything</i>

37:55.040 --> 37:56.973
<i>with my eating
and my exercising,</i>

37:56.975 --> 37:59.776
<i>and I'm doing it all in
accordance to the instructions</i>

37:59.778 --> 38:00.610
<i>in this book he gave me</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:02.812
<i>with the diet
and exercise guide.</i>

38:02.814 --> 38:04.247
I'm gonna do the first count,
and then you count.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.215
Okay, you ready?

38:05.217 --> 38:06.249
Mm-hmm.

38:06.984 --> 38:08.018
One,

38:08.753 --> 38:09.686
two...

38:10.655 --> 38:13.556
<i>My exercises,
I do three times a day.</i>

38:13.558 --> 38:16.559
<i>When I very first started
I was just sitting here and,</i>

38:16.561 --> 38:19.229
my son, he just said,
"Momma, can I do it?"

38:19.231 --> 38:21.197
He just does it right there
along with me.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.400
Five,

38:24.201 --> 38:25.201
four,

38:25.903 --> 38:27.003
three,

38:27.204 --> 38:28.271
two,

38:28.273 --> 38:29.239
one.

38:29.241 --> 38:31.207
We do our shoulders to the side.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.176
Ten,

38:33.244 --> 38:34.311
nine,

38:34.512 --> 38:35.845
eight...

38:35.847 --> 38:38.415
<i>So he's my workout partner,
and I love that.</i>

38:38.417 --> 38:39.916
<i>My exercise time with him</i>

38:39.918 --> 38:41.918
<i>has become
one of my favorite times</i>

38:41.920 --> 38:42.986
<i>with him because of that.</i>

38:43.053 --> 38:44.287
one.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.958
<i>The food and what I'm eating</i>

38:48.960 --> 38:51.561
<i>is something that I'm
on my own with right now.</i>

38:51.563 --> 38:53.863
<i>I prepare and cook my own meals</i>

38:53.865 --> 38:57.133
<i>apart from what Monte cooks
for himself and the kids.</i>

38:57.735 --> 38:59.402
<i>And the rest of my family,</i>

38:59.404 --> 39:01.604
<i>they still eat
what they want to,</i>

39:01.606 --> 39:03.373
<i>because my kids are still kids.</i>

39:03.375 --> 39:05.909
<i>Yes, I still make them eat
healthy choices.</i>

39:05.911 --> 39:09.412
<i>They can still have certain
things in moderation also.</i>

39:09.414 --> 39:11.648
<i>But the focus is mostly on me.</i>

39:11.650 --> 39:13.283
I have to focus on Bianca.

39:13.285 --> 39:16.152
Because Bianca got Bianca
to where Bianca's at.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.155
<i>Either I'm gonna eat healthy
and live,</i>

39:19.157 --> 39:21.057
or either I'm gonna eat
what I want to

39:21.092 --> 39:22.959
and die.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.909
I hope that I reached my goal
for this appointment.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.011
[Romonte] We don't know
what's gonna come,

39:42.179 --> 39:43.680
but whatever comes,

39:43.682 --> 39:45.315
we are gonna be ready.

39:46.283 --> 39:47.951
<i>Me and Monte are back
in Houston again</i>

39:47.953 --> 39:50.153
<i>for my second appointment
with Dr. Now.</i>

39:51.722 --> 39:52.922
<i>But I'm a little nervous</i>

39:53.424 --> 39:56.025
<i>to see how much I've been
able to drop off my weight.</i>

40:21.452 --> 40:22.986
Bianca?

40:24.088 --> 40:27.257
<i>At my first appointment
with Dr. Now two months ago,</i>

40:27.259 --> 40:29.426
<i>I weighed 604 pounds.</i>

40:29.428 --> 40:31.327
<i>And then Dr. Now
gave me a goal</i>

40:31.329 --> 40:32.862
<i>of losing 55 pounds by today</i>

40:32.864 --> 40:35.131
<i>to show that I'm taking control,</i>

40:35.133 --> 40:37.567
<i>and I'm willing to make
the changes that I need</i>

40:37.569 --> 40:39.636
<i>for his program and get surgery.</i>

40:39.638 --> 40:41.337
Okay, you can step up
on the scale.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.640
<i>So if I did that and made it,</i>

40:43.642 --> 40:46.075
<i>then my weight
would be under 551.</i>

40:58.823 --> 41:02.158
- And now we're gonna go to Room 5, Okay?
- Okay, thank you.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.366
<i>You know, that's a large
amount of weight for me to lose.</i>

41:13.637 --> 41:16.306
<i>But I missed my goal
from Dr. Now</i>

41:16.308 --> 41:18.007
<i>'cause that is still
not enough progress</i>

41:18.009 --> 41:19.342
<i>for me to move ahead.</i>

41:35.693 --> 41:37.026
Hello, how are you all doing?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.761
- Fine. How are you.
- [Romonte] Hey, Dr. Now.

41:38.763 --> 41:39.729
You all doing oaky?

41:39.731 --> 41:42.432
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

41:42.434 --> 41:45.702
All right. How was your trip
to Houston this time?

41:45.704 --> 41:47.670
It was a lot better this time.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.873
So then you figured out
what made it better?

41:49.875 --> 41:51.875
Yes, sir, 'cause I've lost
some weight.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.777
Yes you have, and you
lost 46 pounds,

41:54.779 --> 41:56.880
which isn't as much as
you could have,

41:56.882 --> 41:58.181
but it's still not bad.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.449
So I'm happy with that.

41:59.451 --> 42:01.117
That's very good.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.920
So what changes have you made
in your eating habit?

42:03.922 --> 42:05.855
I've been using my food scale,

42:05.857 --> 42:07.590
I've been eating protein
and vegetables,

42:07.592 --> 42:10.426
and I've been exercising
three times a day.

42:10.428 --> 42:13.730
Well, I'm glad to see that
you're in the right track,

42:13.732 --> 42:15.031
and doing the right thing.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.834
So, keep it up and we're
gonna set you up

42:17.836 --> 42:19.669
- for endoscopy...
- Okay.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.637
to look down your stomach

42:20.639 --> 42:22.639
and see what issue
you got there.

42:22.641 --> 42:26.042
Hopefully, it's still possible
to do a revision,

42:26.044 --> 42:27.911
or add another weight loss
surgery on you.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.113
- If we did, that will be good.
- Okay.

42:30.115 --> 42:31.614
And if we determine that,

42:31.616 --> 42:34.017
then you will need
to move down to Houston.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.919
And if you stay on track
up to that point,

42:35.921 --> 42:38.988
then we will move ahead
with weight loss surgery for you

42:38.990 --> 42:40.323
once you're down here.

42:40.691 --> 42:41.424
Okay.

42:41.426 --> 42:42.992
You think you can do that?

42:42.994 --> 42:45.361
Yes, sir. If I can get
a surgery, I can do that.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.230
Okay, good. So...

42:47.232 --> 42:49.732
we'll figure out what's
going on with your stomach.

42:49.734 --> 42:50.800
Okay, thank you.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.403
But if there is too much
scar tissue,

42:53.405 --> 42:56.639
or any other issues
to where it is not possible

42:56.641 --> 42:59.409
to move ahead
with any surgery options,

42:59.411 --> 43:01.744
then we're gonna stick
with your diet.

43:01.746 --> 43:05.315
But hopefully, we will figure
out an option for you, okay?

43:05.749 --> 43:07.817
If you stay in town tonight,

43:07.819 --> 43:09.686
I can schedule that
for tomorrow.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.087
Would that work for you?

43:11.089 --> 43:12.956
Yes, I can do that.
Thank you, Dr. Now.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.958
All right, you're welcome.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.230
That went a lot better
than expected.

43:21.832 --> 43:22.365
See there?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.066
See? Well,

43:24.068 --> 43:26.336
you don't have to be nervous,
you did your part.

43:27.638 --> 43:29.973
I'm happy to see
that Bianca went back

43:29.975 --> 43:31.708
and made some important changes

43:31.710 --> 43:33.743
to lose almost 50 pounds.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.913
<i>If she had been sticking
to the diet completely,</i>

43:36.915 --> 43:38.815
<i>she would have lost
around twice that.</i>

43:38.817 --> 43:41.551
<i>So she is still likely eating</i>

43:41.553 --> 43:43.853
around 2,000 to 3,000 calories
a day,

43:43.855 --> 43:46.923
<i>but she has shown me
enough improvement</i>

43:46.925 --> 43:49.759
to feel confident about moving
ahead with her.

43:49.761 --> 43:52.061
<i>But the big question now is</i>

43:52.063 --> 43:53.896
what kind of weight loss
surgery or revision

43:53.898 --> 43:56.666
is possible for her, if at all.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.635
<i>Because the scar tissue
that has formed</i>

43:58.637 --> 44:00.737
<i>from the first surgery she had</i>

44:00.739 --> 44:03.406
<i>could prevent us from being
able to do much</i>

44:03.408 --> 44:05.008
<i>with a second surgery.</i>

44:05.010 --> 44:07.810
<i>So we will know more
about what's possible</i>

44:07.812 --> 44:08.578
after endoscopy.

44:08.580 --> 44:10.480
<i>And if there is a path,</i>

44:10.482 --> 44:13.216
<i>we can move ahead with
weight loss surgery for her.</i>

44:30.200 --> 44:31.868
- You want me to put your hair...
- Yes, please.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.770
Okay, I got you.

44:33.772 --> 44:35.972
<i>I'm here at the hospital
to have my endoscopy</i>

44:35.974 --> 44:37.874
<i>and find out if it's possible</i>

44:37.876 --> 44:40.410
<i>for another weight loss
surgery for me.</i>

44:40.412 --> 44:41.577
<i>And I'm a little nervous</i>

44:41.579 --> 44:44.414
<i>about what the result
of the procedure could be.</i>

44:44.416 --> 44:46.749
<i>Because the option
of my weight loss surgery</i>

44:46.751 --> 44:48.284
<i>hangs in the balance with that.</i>

44:49.053 --> 44:50.820
<i>But even if I don't have it,</i>

44:50.822 --> 44:52.321
<i>I'm gonna stick to the plan.</i>

44:52.323 --> 44:53.589
<i>I've already started
my new life,</i>

44:53.591 --> 44:54.957
<i>but I'm looking forward
to a better life.</i>

44:54.959 --> 44:57.727
<i>And I'm just ready
to lose more weight</i>

44:57.729 --> 45:00.263
<i>and keep having
a better quality life.</i>

45:00.265 --> 45:02.498
<i>'Cause I'm inspired
by the more stamina</i>

45:02.500 --> 45:03.499
<i>I'm getting day by day</i>

45:03.501 --> 45:05.401
<i>and the healthier I'm getting
day by day.</i>

45:05.403 --> 45:09.405
<i>So I could already imagine 75
pound or 100 pound weight loss</i>

45:09.407 --> 45:10.840
<i>could be like, months from now.</i>

45:10.842 --> 45:13.743
<i>So I'm just ready to keep
pushing regardless.</i>

45:13.745 --> 45:15.011
[Romonte] You look like...

45:15.013 --> 45:17.313
the duchess of Zubundu.

45:25.422 --> 45:26.989
Okay, thank you.

45:29.193 --> 45:31.961
<i>[Dr. Now] Today, we're going
to do an endoscopy on Bianca</i>

45:31.963 --> 45:37.400
<i>and look at her stomach, to see how things
look from her first weight loss surgery,</i>

45:37.402 --> 45:39.368
<i>because she had
a sleeve gastrectomy</i>

45:39.370 --> 45:41.871
<i>and she gained
all her weight back.</i>

45:41.873 --> 45:44.073
We could have you go to the
waiting room right over there, okay?

45:44.075 --> 45:45.174
Okay, thank you.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.542
No problem.

45:50.347 --> 45:53.216
<i>[Dr. Now] So depending what
we're gonna find in endoscopy,</i>

45:53.218 --> 45:56.819
<i>we're gonna make a decision
what will be best option for Bianca.</i>

45:56.821 --> 45:57.754
[woman speaking]

46:06.997 --> 46:09.165
[Dr. Now] All right,
I think we can line her.

46:15.806 --> 46:16.405
[woman speaking]

46:17.908 --> 46:19.041
[woman speaking]

46:24.414 --> 46:25.348
[Dr. Now speaking]

46:34.725 --> 46:35.658
[woman speaking]

46:35.725 --> 46:38.394
[Dr. Now] She's released
for stomach back out.

46:38.396 --> 46:44.167
And it is probably bigger now than it
was before her first weight loss surgery.

46:47.838 --> 46:51.174
[Dr. Now] All right, removing
the scope. We're done.

46:52.209 --> 46:55.211
<i>[Dr. Now] The procedure
went well today.</i>

46:55.213 --> 47:00.149
<i>And we were able to find out what we needed
to determine the next steps with Bianca.</i>

47:00.151 --> 47:03.186
<i>Unfortunately,
one of the things we learned</i>

47:03.188 --> 47:07.490
<i>was that Bianca has a stretched
hernia sleeve, a tremendous sleeve.</i>

47:07.492 --> 47:10.426
That's one of the reasons
that she's not losing weight.

47:10.428 --> 47:15.698
<i>The issue is that Bianca does have
a significant amount of scar tissue</i>

47:15.700 --> 47:18.401
<i>from her previous weight loss
surgery that may make it difficult</i>

47:18.403 --> 47:22.738
<i>for us to perform
a full gastric bypass on her.</i>

47:22.740 --> 47:25.474
<i>The good news is that we
should be able to perform</i>

47:25.476 --> 47:27.977
<i>a gastric sleeve for her.</i>

47:27.979 --> 47:29.879
<i>But since she already had
one weight loss surgery,</i>

47:29.881 --> 47:33.549
the most optimal thing
is to do gastric bypass.

47:33.551 --> 47:36.185
<i>So that's what
we will attempt to perform.</i>

47:36.187 --> 47:40.189
<i>But whether or not we are able
to successfully do that</i>

47:40.191 --> 47:42.725
<i>will have to be determined
during the procedure.</i>

47:42.727 --> 47:45.928
<i>However, either option
should be enough to give her</i>

47:45.930 --> 47:48.931
<i>the tools she needs
to lose more weight.</i>

47:48.933 --> 47:52.134
<i>So ultimately,
that's the good news.</i>

47:52.836 --> 47:55.738
Do you have your sunglasses on?

47:55.740 --> 48:00.743
All right, Bianca. Well,
you know, you had a sleeve.

48:00.745 --> 48:03.479
And it looked like the
sleeve is a little bit dilated.

48:03.481 --> 48:06.449
So you have really stretched
it back out.

48:06.451 --> 48:10.553
But I think it's gonna be
possible for us to do a full bypass.

48:10.555 --> 48:14.924
- Okay.
- So we can do another weight loss surgery on you.

48:14.926 --> 48:18.861
So as soon as you move down to
Houston, we will set you for surgery.

48:18.863 --> 48:19.495
- Okay.
- Okay?

48:19.497 --> 48:21.163
Okay.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.933
So this is gonna be something
that's gonna help you a lot.

48:23.935 --> 48:24.934
- Okay.
- Okay?

48:24.936 --> 48:26.269
Okay.

48:26.271 --> 48:28.738
- All right, if you need anything, let me know.
- Okay, thank you.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.706
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

48:30.708 --> 48:34.677
<i>During a full gastric bypass
on Bianca will give her</i>

48:34.679 --> 48:38.714
a more aggressive tool this time
to help her to lose more weight.

48:38.716 --> 48:42.618
<i>And then after surgery, we will
start her going to psychotherapy</i>

48:42.620 --> 48:46.455
<i>to help her work on dealing
with her emotional issues.</i>

48:46.457 --> 48:50.793
<i>Normally we wait until there
is some struggle after surgery.</i>

48:50.795 --> 48:54.363
<i>Because once the physical
drive to overeat is gone</i>

48:54.365 --> 48:56.399
<i>and they still struggle,</i>

48:56.401 --> 48:59.735
<i>the patient is far more
receptive to see and understand</i>

48:59.737 --> 49:03.372
<i>the emotional component
to their overeating</i>

49:03.374 --> 49:06.342
<i>and embrace what they
need to do to address that.</i>

49:06.344 --> 49:10.379
<i>But since Bianca has already
had one weight loss surgery</i>

49:10.381 --> 49:14.383
<i>and failed it, we'll start that
immediately after surgery.</i>

49:14.385 --> 49:18.754
<i>So we have our plan with Bianca
and know what next steps are for her.</i>

49:18.756 --> 49:20.790
<i>So we will move ahead with her</i>

49:20.792 --> 49:26.128
<i>as long as she stays on track
and moves down to Houston.</i>

49:47.084 --> 49:48.384
<i>[Bianca] I've been doing okay
the past few months.</i>

49:48.386 --> 49:50.886
<i>I was very relieved and excited</i>

49:50.888 --> 49:53.756
<i>when Dr. Now said my results
were good for my endoscopy,</i>

49:53.758 --> 49:57.927
<i>and that I could get weight loss
surgery as long as I move to Houston.</i>

49:57.929 --> 49:59.729
Okay, we got a little
bit more stuff in here.

49:59.731 --> 50:00.763
I'm gonna slip around.

50:00.765 --> 50:03.399
I'm gonna put some
of this medicine in here.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.801
<i>[Bianca] You know, that
was almost four months ago.</i>

50:05.803 --> 50:07.737
<i>So it's taken a bit
to get it all figured out</i>

50:07.739 --> 50:08.838
<i>because it's a lot.</i>

50:08.840 --> 50:11.807
<i>But we started to get
what we need straightened out.</i>

50:11.809 --> 50:15.911
<i>My cousin Neethie is over
helping me with that now.</i>

50:15.913 --> 50:19.415
<i>And then my Aunt Judie and my
Uncle Darrell and his wife Odessa</i>

50:19.417 --> 50:23.052
<i>are gonna come spend some time
with us since we're leaving soon.</i>

50:23.054 --> 50:26.188
<i>So things are comin' together,
but it hasn't been easy.</i>

50:26.390 --> 50:28.190
<i>It's hard to move on your own.</i>

50:28.192 --> 50:32.294
<i>But it's even harder with a
whole family and two young kids.</i>

50:32.296 --> 50:35.898
<i>And what's been the most difficult
is finding an apartment for us.</i>

50:35.900 --> 50:37.233
I mean, if it was
just me and Monte,

50:37.235 --> 50:38.834
<i>we could, you know,
make it work.</i>

50:38.836 --> 50:41.937
<i>But when you have kids, there's
a lot of things you can't settle for.</i>

50:41.939 --> 50:43.472
I have two kids,
so I have to make sure

50:43.474 --> 50:45.875
it's good for me
and my two kids.

50:45.877 --> 50:48.677
[Bianca] Neethie, do you mind
helping me with this box right here?

50:48.679 --> 50:49.812
<i>[Bianca] It was very hard.</i>

50:49.814 --> 50:52.782
<i>I mean, it was some blood,
some sweat, some tears.</i>

50:52.784 --> 50:54.617
Some days when I was
stressed and Monte told me,

50:54.619 --> 50:56.886
<i>"Hey, just back away
and just pray about it.</i>

50:56.888 --> 50:59.655
<i>If it was meant to be,
God'll find a place for us</i>

50:59.657 --> 51:02.858
If it was not meant to be,
then we won't find a place."

51:02.860 --> 51:05.061
<i>And after about a
month and half of feeling</i>

51:05.063 --> 51:06.695
<i>like I wasn't finding
good options,</i>

51:06.697 --> 51:08.898
<i>that started to get to me.</i>

51:08.900 --> 51:11.901
And I would try to go to foods
that I wasn't supposed to have,

51:11.903 --> 51:13.602
and Monte would slap it
out of my hand and say,

51:13.604 --> 51:14.937
<i>"You know
you're not gonna do that.</i>

51:14.939 --> 51:17.373
<i>'Cause it's not worth it.
Look how far you've came."</i>

51:17.375 --> 51:18.841
He'll trash it.
And when I mean trash it,

51:18.843 --> 51:21.744
he'll take it from me, put it in the
trash can, and walk it to the dumpster.

51:21.746 --> 51:24.080
And he's like,
"If you want it, go get it."

51:25.415 --> 51:28.184
<i>So when I have my weak
moments, he keeps me in line.</i>

51:28.952 --> 51:30.753
<i>But thankfully,
we found a place.</i>

51:30.755 --> 51:33.789
<i>And all of us are moving
to Houston for a year.</i>

51:33.791 --> 51:36.225
<i>So it's all come together,
and we're making it happen.</i>

51:54.311 --> 51:55.544
[Romonte]
Come on in here, baby!

51:55.745 --> 51:57.746
[Bianca] Hey, how y'all doin',
Uncle Darrell and Aunt Odessa?

51:57.748 --> 51:58.881
[Bianca] How y'all been doin'?

51:58.883 --> 52:00.249
[Romonte] Come on in here!

52:00.851 --> 52:02.351
How you doin'?

52:02.353 --> 52:03.552
You doin' all right, sweetie?

52:03.554 --> 52:06.522
Oh, hi. I'm doin' good.
I'm doin' good.

52:06.524 --> 52:08.858
<i>[Bianca] I do think the move is gonna
be positive and something good for us.</i>

52:08.860 --> 52:10.826
<i>But leaving the family
we have here</i>

52:10.828 --> 52:12.862
<i>is the only really hard part
for me.</i>

52:12.864 --> 52:14.930
<i>That's hard for me to do.</i>

52:14.932 --> 52:16.265
<i>They're a big support for me.</i>

52:16.267 --> 52:18.868
<i>And not seeing them
is gonna be hard.</i>

52:18.870 --> 52:21.971
<i>And I would never wanna do
that outside of a situation like this.</i>

52:24.574 --> 52:26.041
I mean, it's very scary.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.845
[crying] That's why... You know, I
had to go to the bathroom while ago...

52:29.847 --> 52:32.548
and just get my emotions out
'cause it's very, you know, scary.

52:32.550 --> 52:35.184
It very scary.

52:35.186 --> 52:39.989
With two kids, you know, and going
all the way across the world. It's scary.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.424
[sniffles] You know, I don't
show my emotions a lot,

52:42.426 --> 52:43.592
but it's scary.

52:43.594 --> 52:44.860
But it's something
that I have to do,

52:44.862 --> 52:46.896
so I can be around
for my kids. You know?

52:46.898 --> 52:48.030
[Darrell speaking]

52:49.065 --> 52:49.965
[Bianca speaking]

52:49.967 --> 52:51.100
[Odessa speaking]

52:51.835 --> 52:53.135
[Darrell speaking]

52:53.470 --> 52:56.605
So I'm just taking it
day by day.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.841
I can't worry about next week.
I can't worry about next year.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.075
I can't worry about next month.

53:00.077 --> 53:01.644
All I can worry about is today.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.846
<i>So that' what I'm doing.</i>

53:03.848 --> 53:05.948
- [Darrell] It's going to be okay.
- Yeah, it is.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.950
They're gonna take
good care of ya.

53:07.952 --> 53:08.751
I know they are.

53:08.753 --> 53:10.085
<i>[Bianca] So I'm hoping here soon</i>

53:10.087 --> 53:12.354
<i>we'll have all the final
things we need figured out.</i>

53:12.356 --> 53:14.823
<i>So we can head to Houston
and start the new life</i>

53:14.825 --> 53:19.094
<i>that's full of promise, hope, and
opportunity for me and all of us.</i>

53:20.697 --> 53:22.164
- Lean into him.
- Lean on him.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.200
- Prayers every day.
- Yep.

53:37.914 --> 53:39.815
<i>[Bianca] That's Marcia's dad, and I
love him whether Monte know it or not.</i>

53:39.817 --> 53:42.818
You know, K.K., that I always
look after his best interest.

53:42.820 --> 53:45.387
And all he keeps saying, K.K.,
is that I'm leaving him.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.722
I said, Monte,
I'm not leaving you.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.190
I have to do what I gotta do
for my health.

53:48.192 --> 53:50.192
I got to get better for my kids.

53:50.194 --> 53:54.630
It's not right for you want me to put my
life on hold and my health on hold for you.

53:54.632 --> 53:55.598
That's not right.

53:55.932 --> 53:58.367
<i>[K.K.] Go on
and do what you got to do.</i>

53:58.369 --> 53:59.668
Yes, ma'am.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.571
<i>[Bianca] The past week has
been hard on me and Romonte.</i>

54:02.573 --> 54:04.240
<i>With all we've been trying
to figure out</i>

54:04.242 --> 54:07.409
<i>for the final steps
and move to Houston.</i>

54:07.411 --> 54:10.679
<i>And the stress has been getting
to us, so we've been fighting a lot.</i>

54:10.681 --> 54:14.049
<i>Me and Monte have had
different views on some things.</i>

54:14.051 --> 54:17.753
<i>And it got to a point where
last night I just got frustrated,</i>

54:17.755 --> 54:20.356
<i>so I told him to stop.</i>

54:20.358 --> 54:23.492
<i>I just need a break
from the arguing.</i>

54:23.494 --> 54:25.494
I didn't tell Romonte that I
wanted to break up with him.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.763
I didn't tell Romonte
that I wanted to leave him.

54:27.765 --> 54:30.399
I told Romonte that I
have to get Bianca together

54:30.401 --> 54:32.534
so I can take care of my kids.

54:32.536 --> 54:33.636
Our kids.

54:35.105 --> 54:36.705
<i>Me and Romonte were together
for three years.</i>

54:36.707 --> 54:39.508
<i>And I still worry about him.</i>

54:39.510 --> 54:44.013
<i>But like I told Romonte, I love
him, but I love my kids more.</i>

54:44.015 --> 54:45.614
<i>And I have to get better
for my kids</i>

54:45.616 --> 54:47.549
<i>so I can be around for them.</i>

54:47.551 --> 54:49.518
My plan is still to go
to Houston. I'm a fighter.

54:49.520 --> 54:54.657
This is just a steppin' stone and
gonna be part of my testimony.

54:54.659 --> 54:57.660
<i>You know, I'm gonna continue to pray for
him, continuing to wish the best for him.</i>

54:57.662 --> 55:01.096
<i>But I have to continue
on my journey.</i>

55:01.098 --> 55:05.100
I'm gonna finish packing up some
boxes and just get everything together

55:05.102 --> 55:06.735
so we can still move.

55:06.737 --> 55:11.106
<i>And, luckily, Neethie said that
she'll move with me, so that's a plus.</i>

55:11.108 --> 55:13.242
<i>So I'm gonna figure it out
and get to Houston.</i>

55:18.181 --> 55:19.214
[woman speaking]

55:20.850 --> 55:22.017
Okay.

55:22.952 --> 55:24.320
Okay. I see it. Mm-hmm.

55:24.322 --> 55:25.287
Mommy.

55:28.124 --> 55:29.525
Okay.

55:29.527 --> 55:30.726
<i>[Bianca] Me and Neethie
have been working</i>

55:30.728 --> 55:32.795
<i>to get all the last things
we need done</i>

55:32.797 --> 55:34.663
<i>to get on the road
and move to Houston.</i>

55:34.665 --> 55:36.699
<i>And right now,
we're gettin' the movin' van.</i>

55:36.701 --> 55:39.535
- [Bianca] Are we going out this door?
- [woman] Yeah.

55:39.537 --> 55:42.938
<i>[Bianca] This was something that
Romonte was gonna do, but it's on me now.</i>

55:42.940 --> 55:45.140
<i>And I've never done
anything like this</i>

55:45.142 --> 55:47.242
<i>because I have to drive it, too.</i>

55:51.915 --> 55:52.781
[Bianca] Yeah.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.050
Does the seat let back
any more, miss?

55:55.485 --> 55:57.619
Okay. Okay, thank you.

55:57.621 --> 56:00.055
<i>[Bianca] But I'm ready to do
whatever I have to.</i>

56:00.057 --> 56:03.125
<i>To keep moving forward
no matter what I face.</i>

56:05.061 --> 56:06.128
[Bianca grunts]

56:09.199 --> 56:10.232
[Bianca] No!

56:23.079 --> 56:24.346
[turn blinker clicking]

56:32.422 --> 56:33.355
[woman on phone speaking]

56:35.959 --> 56:36.892
[Bianca speaking]

56:44.934 --> 56:46.301
<i>[Bianca] Okay, thank you,
sweetheart.</i>

56:46.369 --> 56:48.036
[Bianca speaking]

56:49.839 --> 56:52.975
<i>[Bianca] I've hired some movers
to help us get everything loaded up.</i>

56:52.977 --> 56:56.712
<i>So having the extra strength will
hopefully get us on the road quickly.</i>

56:56.714 --> 56:58.814
<i>Because once we get loaded up,</i>

56:58.816 --> 57:01.383
<i>we're gonna head out and
start the journey to Houston.</i>

57:14.998 --> 57:16.965
[Bianca] It's dragging
right there on the floor.

57:24.474 --> 57:25.741
[Bianca] Y'all gotta get it
off that grass

57:25.743 --> 57:27.276
'cause there be chiggers
and stuff on that grass.

57:27.278 --> 57:28.677
Y'all need me to try
to help y'all?

57:28.679 --> 57:31.213
'Cause I don't want it on that
grass. My kids'll be on that.

57:31.215 --> 57:32.648
I'll try to help y'all.
Come on.

57:32.650 --> 57:34.983
'Cause I don't need it
on that grass.

57:36.052 --> 57:38.253
Tacor, you wanna come help
them, and I'll pay you somethin'.

57:38.621 --> 57:39.988
I got you, bro.

57:39.990 --> 57:42.257
[Bianca] 'Cause you know
how expensive that furniture is.

57:45.862 --> 57:46.695
I wasn't trying to be rude.

57:46.697 --> 57:48.063
But my baby got ate up
by chiggers.

57:48.065 --> 57:49.898
I just don't want the, you
know, chiggers in the couch

57:49.900 --> 57:50.632
and her to get ate up.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.434
[Bianca clears throat]

57:57.474 --> 58:01.944
<i>[Bianca] Just recently, this level of
moving activity wouldn't have been possible.</i>

58:01.946 --> 58:04.513
[Bianca] Yeah, I told them I didn't
know anything about taking the bed down.

58:04.515 --> 58:07.216
They said y'all could take
that bed down.

58:08.718 --> 58:11.053
Uh-huh, yeah, I'd like to take
them all with me

58:11.055 --> 58:13.355
'cause I like to, you know,
be better safe than sorry.

58:13.357 --> 58:14.656
- I get ya.
- Uh-huh.

58:14.691 --> 58:17.192
<i>[Bianca] I stuck to the
diet and exercise religiously</i>

58:17.194 --> 58:20.095
<i>to insure
that I keep moving forward.</i>

58:20.097 --> 58:23.966
<i>The only period I've let myself
struggle and given in for some comfort</i>

58:23.968 --> 58:26.401
<i>is recently
with everything going on.</i>

58:26.403 --> 58:30.005
<i>And I plan to keep working
hard once I get to Houston,</i>

58:30.007 --> 58:32.808
<i>even moving forward without
Romonte to do a lot on my own.</i>

58:32.810 --> 58:34.009
<i>That's scary.</i>

58:34.377 --> 58:37.112
<i>But I believe in myself,
and I know I can do this.</i>

58:41.217 --> 58:45.020
[exhales] Oh, Jesus, give
me the strength, Lord. I'm tired.

58:45.755 --> 58:47.055
[exhales]

58:47.724 --> 58:50.759
Gotta keep goin' though,
for my kids.

58:50.761 --> 58:52.094
I gotta keep goin'.

58:57.033 --> 58:58.033
[Tacorey] Thank you.

58:59.903 --> 59:02.838
-Well, thank you. Enjoy Houston.
-Thank you.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.107
Thank you so much.
Her bed's already gone out?

59:05.109 --> 59:07.543
- No, it's the last one we're gettin'.
- Okay.

59:07.545 --> 59:09.678
<i>[Bianca] This was tough
to get done physically.</i>

59:09.680 --> 59:11.880
<i>But we got it done in two hours.</i>

59:11.882 --> 59:14.716
<i>I did more than I thought
I was able to.</i>

59:14.718 --> 59:17.886
I pushed my body
to the limit today.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.821
And I'm know I'm gonna
be very sore tomorrow.

59:19.823 --> 59:23.025
<i>When I say I'm tired,
it's an understatement.</i>

59:35.705 --> 59:38.173
Neethie has always been
a plan B.

59:38.175 --> 59:40.642
Because, deep down, I kind of...

59:40.644 --> 59:43.478
I kind of figured that Neethie
was gonna come anyway.

59:43.480 --> 59:47.049
So, Neethie-- once I asked her,
you know, could she come with me

59:47.051 --> 59:49.585
'cause I still want to complete
this journey that I started,

59:49.587 --> 59:50.953
she agreed to it.

59:50.955 --> 59:54.856
I hope Houston is ready for
myself, Neethie and my kids

59:54.858 --> 59:57.025
because we're ready for Houston.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.407
[Bianca] Oh, you're
gonna carry her, Neethie?

1:00:12.409 --> 1:00:14.710
<i>I handled the travel
better this time,</i>

1:00:14.712 --> 1:00:17.980
<i>but the packin' up before
we left took a lot out of me.</i>

1:00:17.982 --> 1:00:20.549
<i>So I just wanna get moved in
and rest.</i>

1:00:20.551 --> 1:00:21.917
<i>So we have some movers</i>

1:00:21.919 --> 1:00:25.020
<i>that will help us with all
the big and strenuous stuff.</i>

1:00:25.022 --> 1:00:27.089
What you think, Marcia?

1:00:27.423 --> 1:00:31.093
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

1:00:31.095 --> 1:00:33.362
[Bianca] <i>As of lately,
I've had some slip-ups,</i>

1:00:33.364 --> 1:00:35.464
<i>but that's only very recent.</i>

1:00:35.466 --> 1:00:39.267
<i>In the majority of all that time,
I was doing exactly as I need.</i>

1:00:39.269 --> 1:00:41.303
<i>You know, it's been months
of eating right and exercise</i>

1:00:41.305 --> 1:00:45.841
<i>and just about every day as I've dealt
with everything that has come my way.</i>

1:00:45.843 --> 1:00:49.645
<i>So, as soon as we get settled
and have some time to recoup,</i>

1:00:49.647 --> 1:00:51.780
<i>I'm gonna call Dr. Now
to set an appointment</i>

1:00:51.782 --> 1:00:53.415
<i>so I can show him my progress</i>

1:00:53.417 --> 1:00:55.751
<i>and that I'm still
sticking to it,</i>

1:00:55.753 --> 1:00:58.353
<i>and doing what I need
since my last appointment.</i>

1:00:58.521 --> 1:01:00.288
Simeon, be good.

1:01:09.866 --> 1:01:13.402
[GPS automated voice] <i>Use the
right two lanes to exit right to I45.</i>

[Bianca]
<i>We're heading to Dr. Now's</i>

1:01:14.471 --> 1:01:17.039
<i>to get my weight
and my progress checked.</i>

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:19.975
<i>And to, hopefully, get my
weight loss surgery approval</i>

1:01:19.977 --> 1:01:20.942
<i>now that I'm here.</i>

1:01:20.944 --> 1:01:22.911
<i>And I'm ready to do this.</i>

1:01:22.913 --> 1:01:26.848
Here we are, ya'll.
Dr. Now's office.

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:28.350
[shuts car door]
[Bianca] Come on.

1:01:35.825 --> 1:01:36.958
Come on.

1:01:40.730 --> 1:01:42.097
Bianca?

1:01:43.633 --> 1:01:47.436
- [Bianca] How are you?
- I'm okay. Hi.

1:01:47.438 --> 1:01:49.404
[Bianca]
<i>At my last appointment,</i>

1:01:49.406 --> 1:01:53.008
<i>I was 558 and Dr. Now
didn't give me a specific goal.</i>

1:01:53.010 --> 1:01:54.710
<i>Since I met the one he gave me,</i>

1:01:54.712 --> 1:01:57.245
<i>he told me just to make sure
that I keep making progress.</i>

1:01:57.247 --> 1:01:58.814
[woman]
Okay, so step up on the scale.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:02:01.917
[Bianca] <i>I'm losing like I
should and I think I've done that.</i>

1:02:01.919 --> 1:02:03.585
<i>So hopefully
I have a good number</i>

1:02:03.587 --> 1:02:06.221
<i>that Dr. Now
will be happy with.</i>

1:02:13.329 --> 1:02:16.031
- We're gonna be going to Room 5.
- Okay. Come on.

1:02:24.841 --> 1:02:26.274
[Bianca]
<i>It's discouraging</i>

1:02:26.276 --> 1:02:29.878
<i>because I think if I had my
weight checked just two weeks ago,</i>

1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.114
<i>it would have showed
a lot of progress.</i>

1:02:33.983 --> 1:02:34.850
[Bianca]
Over here, baby, come on.

1:02:34.852 --> 1:02:36.384
<i>Hopefully,
Dr. Now doesn't think</i>

1:02:36.386 --> 1:02:38.553
<i>this means I'm not dedicated</i>

1:02:38.555 --> 1:02:41.356
<i>and try my hardest
because I have been.</i>

1:02:46.996 --> 1:02:49.264
<i>I just had a really bad
couple of weeks.</i>

1:02:50.166 --> 1:02:50.899
[knocking at door]

1:02:50.901 --> 1:02:53.001
[Bianca] Come in.

1:02:53.870 --> 1:02:55.103
[Dr. Now]
Hello, how ya'll doing?

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:56.404
Okay, how are you?

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:58.106
All right.

1:02:58.108 --> 1:03:00.809
Well, nice to see you
again, Bianca.

1:03:00.811 --> 1:03:02.043
Good to see you also.

1:03:02.045 --> 1:03:03.912
How you been?

1:03:03.914 --> 1:03:06.815
I've been going through a
lot, Dr. Now, but I'm here.

1:03:06.817 --> 1:03:08.617
I, I've finally
moved to Houston,

1:03:08.619 --> 1:03:10.819
but this week was a tryin' week,

1:03:10.821 --> 1:03:12.220
it was a very hard week for me.

1:03:13.289 --> 1:03:14.956
Well, what happened?

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:19.027
[sighs] Well, you know, you see,
as you see, Romonte is not here.

1:03:19.029 --> 1:03:20.395
We had an argument.

1:03:20.397 --> 1:03:23.365
He had tough times dealing with
the stress of this move to Houston.

1:03:23.367 --> 1:03:26.001
And he told me that he knows
that I don't care about him.

1:03:26.003 --> 1:03:29.437
- He said he rather just end it instead of moving to Houston.
- Okay.

1:03:29.439 --> 1:03:31.306
So, I have my cousin,
Neethie, with me

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:33.441
and she didn't hesitate
when I picked up the phone

1:03:33.443 --> 1:03:37.679
and asked her could she come to Texas with
me and my kids to help me on this journey.

1:03:37.681 --> 1:03:39.948
Well, I'm, uh, sorry that
you're going through that.

1:03:39.950 --> 1:03:42.851
[Bianca] Thank you. But
I'm still focused on being here

1:03:42.853 --> 1:03:45.420
and doing what I need
for my kids and my life.

1:03:45.422 --> 1:03:48.623
I can't focus on that right now,
I have to focus on my journey.

1:03:48.625 --> 1:03:50.926
- So, he has to focus on himself right now.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

1:03:50.928 --> 1:03:54.930
All right, so, it's you
and your kids and her.

1:03:54.932 --> 1:03:57.599
- Yes, sir, my cousin Neethie.
- Okay.

1:03:57.601 --> 1:04:00.035
So, y'all situated
in here and all that?

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:01.369
[Bianca]
Yes, sir, we got all situated.

1:04:01.371 --> 1:04:02.570
[Dr. Now] Okay, so,

1:04:02.572 --> 1:04:04.840
how you doing with your
eating habits during all this?

1:04:04.842 --> 1:04:08.410
You didn't lose any more
weight over the last four months.

1:04:08.412 --> 1:04:10.445
[Bianca] Um, it's been
okay, it's been up and down.

1:04:10.447 --> 1:04:12.347
I've been, you know, making
some mistakes and stuff,

1:04:12.349 --> 1:04:15.517
but I've been trying to stick
with it despite all of that.

1:04:15.519 --> 1:04:19.821
I've just been, you know, going
back to old habits and stuff like that

1:04:19.823 --> 1:04:23.892
and it's been stressing through this
past week or two with the move and stuff.

1:04:23.894 --> 1:04:25.861
Okay. I can understand that.

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:29.764
Things have been tough, but you
still have to focus on your health.

1:04:29.766 --> 1:04:32.734
And you could have easily lost
over 150 pounds

1:04:32.736 --> 1:04:34.769
since the last time
you were here.

1:04:34.771 --> 1:04:38.740
But the fact that you didn't
lose anything is a bit concerning.

1:04:38.742 --> 1:04:40.942
The last time,
you lost some weight,

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:42.711
but you could have
done better...

1:04:42.713 --> 1:04:43.712
- Yes, sir.
- with your weight loss.

1:04:43.714 --> 1:04:46.147
But it was still enough
to show me

1:04:46.149 --> 1:04:50.051
that you are taking control of
things to turn your life around.

1:04:50.053 --> 1:04:54.656
So, that's why I approved you for weight
loss surgery if you moved down here.

1:04:54.658 --> 1:04:56.858
Now that you got in here,

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:59.261
I have some concerns
with your lack of progress

1:04:59.263 --> 1:05:03.198
and how you're doing with everything
that happened to you recently.

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.468
So, I'm gonna postpone the new
weight loss surgery for two things.

1:05:06.470 --> 1:05:07.568
Okay.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:10.772
Okay, the first is,
I want you to see a therapist,

1:05:10.774 --> 1:05:14.342
so you can start meeting with
them about your emotional issues.

1:05:14.344 --> 1:05:17.212
But also, because
I want them to asses

1:05:17.214 --> 1:05:20.315
if they think you still ready to
move ahead with weight loss surgery.

1:05:20.317 --> 1:05:21.917
Okay.

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:25.987
So, let's start focus on getting
your weight down and see a therapist

1:05:25.989 --> 1:05:28.423
- and we'll pick it up from here. Okay?
- [Bianca] Okay.

1:05:28.425 --> 1:05:31.426
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Okay, thank you.

1:05:36.766 --> 1:05:38.934
[door closes]

1:05:46.575 --> 1:05:49.611
<i>So I know things aren't
easy for her right now.</i>

1:05:49.613 --> 1:05:52.747
<i>But as hard as it has been
for her to get here,</i>

1:05:52.749 --> 1:05:55.550
it's not gonna be good
for us to move ahead with her

1:05:55.552 --> 1:05:57.852
<i>and do any sort
of weight loss surgery</i>

1:05:57.854 --> 1:05:59.854
<i>if she's not in a place
where she's focused</i>

1:05:59.856 --> 1:06:01.823
on doing
what she needs right now.

1:06:01.825 --> 1:06:04.793
<i>She used her circumstances
and her emotions</i>

1:06:04.795 --> 1:06:08.430
<i>to justify her waiting
for her whole life.</i>

1:06:08.432 --> 1:06:11.399
<i>And now, all she has
going on in her life,</i>

1:06:11.401 --> 1:06:14.402
I need to know it's not
gonna be too much for her.

1:06:14.404 --> 1:06:16.471
If everything looks good
in a couple of months,

1:06:16.473 --> 1:06:19.240
<i>I will move ahead
with her surgery.</i>

1:06:19.242 --> 1:06:24.245
<i>But if not, then we'll have to start
working on a different plan with her.</i>

1:06:27.350 --> 1:06:30.952
<i>[Bianca] I'm disappointed I'm not getting
to move ahead with my surgery right now,</i>

1:06:30.954 --> 1:06:33.755
<i>but I can understand
Dr. Now's thinking.</i>

1:06:33.757 --> 1:06:35.390
<i>And I was happy
that the appointment</i>

1:06:35.392 --> 1:06:37.559
<i>went better
than I thought it would.</i>

1:06:37.561 --> 1:06:40.762
<i>I thought that he was gonna be
very upset with me,</i>

1:06:40.764 --> 1:06:42.897
but he was more concerning
with my mental health

1:06:42.899 --> 1:06:44.666
and making sure that I was okay

1:06:44.668 --> 1:06:45.700
with what happened with Romonte.

1:06:45.702 --> 1:06:46.868
Come on, Marcia and Simeon.

1:06:46.870 --> 1:06:49.738
<i>Um, he's gonna set
a therapy for me.</i>

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:52.273
Go ahead and get in
and buckle up for me.

1:06:52.275 --> 1:06:54.542
<i>So I'm staying focused
and doing with I need</i>

1:06:54.544 --> 1:06:58.680
<i>because I didn't bring my family to
Houston, Texas, just to play any games.</i>

1:06:58.682 --> 1:07:00.682
<i>I could have stayed
in Tennessee and played games.</i>

1:07:00.684 --> 1:07:02.717
You know, the ball's
in my court now,

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:06.988
this is my opportunity
and I'm not gonna mess it up.

1:07:22.405 --> 1:07:24.973
[Bianca]
Yesterday, I met with Dr. Now

1:07:24.975 --> 1:07:26.875
and I told him about everything
that happened with Romonte.

1:07:26.877 --> 1:07:29.677
And he told me
that he thought it was best

1:07:29.679 --> 1:07:31.646
that I went and saw a therapist.

1:07:31.648 --> 1:07:35.884
So, I'm nervous about it, but I
know that it's very much needed.

1:07:35.886 --> 1:07:40.955
And I'm tired of my kids having to
be hindered from living a fulfilling life

1:07:40.957 --> 1:07:42.824
because they have a mother
that's obese

1:07:42.826 --> 1:07:46.561
and not able to take on
the activity of just walking

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:49.130
from day to day
without getting exhausted.

1:08:15.825 --> 1:08:19.027
Bianca, I'm Dr. Paradise
Come on in.

1:08:24.934 --> 1:08:29.404
Welcome. So,
what was your childhood like?

1:08:29.406 --> 1:08:30.839
My childhood was okay.

1:08:30.841 --> 1:08:32.941
My mom took care of me,
she was a good mom.

1:08:32.943 --> 1:08:34.909
- She was just an alcoholic.
- Okay.

1:08:34.911 --> 1:08:36.411
So, what she would do is

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:39.581
she would be drinking and to
keep me quiet, she would feed me.

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:40.782
Who was in your house?
Who did you grow up with?

1:08:40.784 --> 1:08:43.551
- My mom an then, my stepdad.
- Okay.

1:08:43.553 --> 1:08:47.021
So, she got drunk that meant
you got cookies and chips and...

1:08:47.023 --> 1:08:48.556
It was even deeper
than that, Dr. Paradise.

1:08:48.558 --> 1:08:51.826
I could remember times when
I would eat pizza and throw up.

1:08:51.828 --> 1:08:53.528
And then after that, she
was giving me some burgers.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:55.029
It was to that point.

1:08:55.031 --> 1:08:58.099
What do you think she was
doing by feeding you so much?

1:08:58.101 --> 1:09:00.935
- Just trying to keep me quiet so she could drink.
- Okay.

1:09:00.937 --> 1:09:03.605
Did you have friends?

1:09:03.607 --> 1:09:04.873
Um, I didn't really
call 'em friends

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:06.508
'cause friends don't talk
about you.

1:09:06.510 --> 1:09:08.843
- Okay, so, the kids were mean.
- Mm-hmm.

1:09:08.845 --> 1:09:11.980
And that's a kid that sounds
like junior high, middle school.

1:09:11.982 --> 1:09:14.582
Okay, what did...
What did the teasing do?

1:09:14.584 --> 1:09:16.618
Did it motivate you
to lose weight?

1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:18.953
- It just made me eat more.
- Okay.

1:09:18.955 --> 1:09:20.788
What's goin' on at home
with this...

1:09:20.790 --> 1:09:22.924
Mom and stepdad still together?

1:09:22.926 --> 1:09:25.093
Okay, my dad died in 2005,

1:09:25.095 --> 1:09:27.729
my stepdad died in 2006,

1:09:27.731 --> 1:09:29.364
and then my mom died in 2009.

1:09:30.166 --> 1:09:32.267
- Are you--
- I found my mom dead.

1:09:32.269 --> 1:09:33.401
Oh.

1:09:33.403 --> 1:09:36.104
Okay, tell me about that.

1:09:36.639 --> 1:09:38.640
When we walked in there,
she was already dead.

1:09:38.642 --> 1:09:41.276
Her lips were already blue
like she had aspirated.

1:09:41.278 --> 1:09:44.546
Then they said that it was cardiac
arrest, she had a heart attack.

1:09:44.548 --> 1:09:47.148
And that's what makes me wanna
fight so hard, too, Dr. Paradise,

1:09:47.150 --> 1:09:50.685
because my kids shouldn't
have to go through that with me.

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:52.754
You know, it hurts me

1:09:52.756 --> 1:09:55.557
because the last thing I should've
told my mom was I love her

1:09:55.559 --> 1:09:57.759
and the last thing I had with
my mom was an argument

1:09:57.761 --> 1:09:59.761
'cause I just begged her...
[crying]

1:09:59.763 --> 1:10:02.997
[sniffles]
I begged her not to drink.

1:10:02.999 --> 1:10:05.033
I just didn't want her to drink.

1:10:05.035 --> 1:10:06.868
I just begged her,
I said, "Please.

1:10:06.870 --> 1:10:09.337
Please, Mama,
don't drink tonight, please."

1:10:09.339 --> 1:10:12.073
And she still drank.

1:10:12.075 --> 1:10:15.843
I just... It's very hard. That's why I
named my daughter after my mom.

1:10:15.845 --> 1:10:17.445
So she can live on.

1:10:17.447 --> 1:10:19.647
So, Bianca,
let's talk about that idea

1:10:19.649 --> 1:10:23.718
that the last interaction you
had with her was an argument.

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:25.720
I feel like you were trying
to help her.

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:28.022
I was trying to help her, I was.

1:10:28.024 --> 1:10:30.458
It wasn't an angry argument,
it was a loving argument, right?

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:32.493
Yes.

1:10:32.495 --> 1:10:37.031
I mean, the last interaction you had
was, was an attempt to help her out.

1:10:37.033 --> 1:10:39.834
Yes. I just, I just wanted
her to stop drinking.

1:10:39.836 --> 1:10:41.903
I just wanted her to get better.

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:44.739
Yeah, I hear
that commitment to your kids.

1:10:44.741 --> 1:10:46.608
And you're committed
more than anything

1:10:46.610 --> 1:10:48.710
to make sure that your
kids don't go through

1:10:48.712 --> 1:10:51.946
all the bad things
that you went through.

1:10:51.948 --> 1:10:56.251
Yeah, I, I kind of want that to
be the thing that mobilizes you.

1:10:56.253 --> 1:10:57.986
Right.

1:10:57.988 --> 1:11:00.955
You know, when an airplane's going
down and the oxygen masks drop,

1:11:00.957 --> 1:11:03.524
they say, "Put the
mask on yourself first

1:11:03.526 --> 1:11:05.994
before you put it
on your kids."

1:11:05.996 --> 1:11:10.565
So, we gotta get you taking care
of yourself before anything else.

1:11:10.567 --> 1:11:13.935
The best way to take care
of your kids is to focus on you.

1:11:13.937 --> 1:11:17.672
And coming her to Houston
is a great example of that.

1:11:17.674 --> 1:11:19.707
Do you believe you're
gonna be successful here?

1:11:19.709 --> 1:11:20.808
I know I'm gonna be successful.

1:11:20.810 --> 1:11:23.678
- Okay, prove it to me.
- I will.

1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:27.048
- Have a good night, okay?
- You too, thank you.

1:11:28.717 --> 1:11:31.986
[Bianca] <i>A lot of what I discussed
was hard for me to go through.</i>

1:11:32.021 --> 1:11:34.422
- Take care.
- You too.

1:11:34.424 --> 1:11:36.457
[Bianca]
<i>But it felt good to do.</i>

1:11:36.459 --> 1:11:39.494
<i>And I know getting healthy
physically and mentally is the only way</i>

1:11:39.496 --> 1:11:42.997
<i>I'm gonna be able to get my
approval to move ahead with surgery.</i>

1:12:12.928 --> 1:12:16.097
[Bianca] <i>I'm headed to see
Dr. Now for my next appointment</i>

1:12:16.099 --> 1:12:17.231
<i>and find out where my weight</i>

1:12:17.233 --> 1:12:19.967
<i>and on my progress stands
for the past two months.</i>

1:12:21.603 --> 1:12:24.639
- Okay, Simi, we're here.
- [Simeon] Yay!

1:12:24.641 --> 1:12:27.642
<i>[Bianca] I'm nervous
to get on the scale.</i>

1:12:27.644 --> 1:12:31.379
<i>I won't move forward if my
progress isn't sufficient for Dr. Now.</i>

1:12:31.381 --> 1:12:33.848
<i>So, that's all
I'm nervous about.</i>

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:36.617
<i>I was only 557 two months
ago at my last appointment.</i>

1:12:36.619 --> 1:12:37.919
Come on, Simeon.

1:12:37.921 --> 1:12:40.688
<i>And that was pretty much
where I was the prior time</i>

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:43.524
<i>I got my weight checked
before that.</i>

1:12:43.526 --> 1:12:46.861
<i>So, Dr. Now needed to see me
go in the right direction</i>

1:12:46.863 --> 1:12:51.232
<i>by losing at least 30 pounds
today to get down to 527.</i>

1:12:51.234 --> 1:12:52.400
Simeon, stand still.

1:12:54.403 --> 1:12:56.137
Bianca?

1:13:16.759 --> 1:13:18.092
[machine beeping]

1:13:21.163 --> 1:13:22.997
[sighs in relief]

1:13:27.102 --> 1:13:29.003
Thank you, Simeon.

1:13:29.838 --> 1:13:32.373
Thank you.

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:34.976
<i>- [woman] So, we are gonna be going to Room 5.
- [Bianca] Okay.</i>

1:13:38.046 --> 1:13:40.615
<i>[Bianca] You know, seeing that
number feels really good.</i>

1:13:40.617 --> 1:13:43.951
<i>I'm making a such a huge leap
in my weight loss.</i>

1:13:43.953 --> 1:13:46.154
<i>I feel really proud
of myself right now.</i>

1:13:46.622 --> 1:13:48.156
Close the door, Simeon.

1:13:57.666 --> 1:13:59.434
- [knock at door]
- [Bianca] Come in.

1:14:01.703 --> 1:14:03.738
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?

1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:06.107
-I'm doing okay. How you doing?
-Good.

1:14:06.109 --> 1:14:08.576
- Well, I can see that.
- How are you?

1:14:08.578 --> 1:14:09.911
I'm doing good.

1:14:09.913 --> 1:14:12.747
- So, it looks like you lost some weight.
- Yes, sir.

1:14:12.749 --> 1:14:15.383
[Dr. Now]
Good. That's a good progress.

1:14:15.385 --> 1:14:20.221
- Yes, sir.
- And so, you've done good job on losing weight now.

1:14:22.925 --> 1:14:25.460
Which is good.
And Dr. Paradise feels

1:14:25.462 --> 1:14:28.129
like you are able to focus and
what you need right now.

1:14:28.131 --> 1:14:31.599
So, I'm gonna approve you
for weight loss surgery.

1:14:31.601 --> 1:14:33.601
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1:14:33.603 --> 1:14:35.436
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

1:14:35.438 --> 1:14:37.805
I'm gonna set you up
for next month.

1:14:37.807 --> 1:14:43.010
But don't get comfortable and
start to step on your progress, okay?

1:14:43.012 --> 1:14:45.713
- Okay.
- Keep your weight going in the right direction.

1:14:45.715 --> 1:14:47.648
- You got it?
- Got it.

1:14:47.650 --> 1:14:50.952
Al right. You're doing great
and I'm proud of your progress.

1:14:50.954 --> 1:14:54.856
So, keep it up and we get you
to the operation and this time,

1:14:54.858 --> 1:14:56.357
you want to be successful.

1:14:56.359 --> 1:14:58.626
Okay. Thank you so
much Dr. Now.

1:14:58.628 --> 1:15:01.128
- And you're welcome.
- Did you understand what he said, Simeon?

1:15:01.130 --> 1:15:03.130
He's gonna do Mommy's surgery.

1:15:05.934 --> 1:15:07.335
Are you excited?

1:15:08.804 --> 1:15:10.071
Hmm?

1:15:10.672 --> 1:15:12.874
You excited?

1:15:12.876 --> 1:15:15.743
[Dr. Now] He's not sure
about it now.

1:15:15.745 --> 1:15:17.411
He's proud of Mom, too.

1:15:17.413 --> 1:15:19.213
You are! Go take a seat.

1:15:19.848 --> 1:15:20.882
Thank you.

1:15:20.884 --> 1:15:24.151
Is everybody doing well and
getting settled in?

1:15:24.153 --> 1:15:27.421
- Everything's going good.
- Okay, that's good.

1:15:27.423 --> 1:15:31.692
Keep going to therapy and
working on things with Dr. Paradise.

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:34.529
That's important. And then
keep up the good work.

1:15:34.531 --> 1:15:35.930
And we'll see next month.

1:15:35.932 --> 1:15:37.798
- Okay?
- Okay, thank you so much, Dr. Now.

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:40.902
You're welcome. And in the meantime,
you need anything, you may call.

1:15:40.904 --> 1:15:45.006
Okay, thank you so much, Dr. Now.
You made my day. Thank you.

1:15:45.008 --> 1:15:46.841
-All right. I'll see you later.
-Okay, see you later.

1:15:46.843 --> 1:15:50.211
- Okay, make sure if you need anything, give me a call.
- Okay, I will.

1:15:56.251 --> 1:15:59.020
- Are you excited?
- Give me a kiss.

1:15:59.022 --> 1:16:00.054
[kissing]

1:16:00.056 --> 1:16:02.790
- Mama!
- What?

1:16:02.792 --> 1:16:06.961
What if they go on my cheek?

1:16:07.696 --> 1:16:10.197
- [kisses]
- [laughing]

1:16:11.199 --> 1:16:14.368
I'm gonna go
look in the bathroom mirror.

1:16:14.370 --> 1:16:18.940
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm very happy to see
that Bianca has continued to work hard</i>

1:16:18.942 --> 1:16:22.476
to make sure she kept her
progress going in the right direction.

1:16:22.544 --> 1:16:24.545
- Too slow!
- [laughs]

1:16:24.547 --> 1:16:28.683
<i>[Dr. Now] I know that wasn't easy for
her with everything she had going on.</i>

1:16:28.685 --> 1:16:32.653
But she's proving that she's
determined to turn her life around

1:16:32.655 --> 1:16:36.424
<i>no matter what her situation
is. So, because of that and</i>

1:16:36.426 --> 1:16:40.695
since Dr. Paradise feels
she is ready for this next step,

1:16:40.697 --> 1:16:43.698
we will move ahead with her
weight loss surgery next month

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:46.434
<i>as long as she keeps
making progress.</i>

1:16:46.436 --> 1:16:51.973
But I think Bianca is motivated
to stay on track until then.

1:16:53.842 --> 1:16:57.278
<i>[Bianca] I'm very excited right now.
You know, to finally have my approval.</i>

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:58.746
Give me the keys, Simeon.

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:00.247
Come on.

1:17:00.249 --> 1:17:03.584
<i>I'm very glad that Simeon was
here to share this moment with me.</i>

1:17:03.586 --> 1:17:06.020
<i>So, this was a big day
for both of us</i>

1:17:06.022 --> 1:17:08.422
<i>because of what this means
for our future.</i>

1:17:08.424 --> 1:17:10.157
[indistinct conversation]

1:17:34.416 --> 1:17:37.118
- All right, love you.
- I love you too. Okay?

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:39.854
[Bianca]
<i>I'm very excited about today.</i>

1:17:39.856 --> 1:17:43.491
<i>And I'm thankful Dr. Now is
gonna do weight loss surgery on me.</i>

1:17:43.493 --> 1:17:44.859
Ready to rock and roll?

1:17:44.861 --> 1:17:46.727
<i>He gave me a second chance
at my life.</i>

1:17:46.729 --> 1:17:49.430
<i>I know that many people
in my situation</i>

1:17:49.432 --> 1:17:52.366
<i>aren't able to have
a opportunity like this twice.</i>

1:17:55.137 --> 1:17:59.206
[nurse] I want you to take
nice big deep breaths for me.

1:17:59.241 --> 1:18:01.742
Okay, keep that.

1:18:01.744 --> 1:18:05.813
<i>[Dr. Now] Today we are attempting
to do a gastric bypass on Bianca.</i>

1:18:05.815 --> 1:18:08.783
<i>We are going to do this
operation robotically.</i>

1:18:08.785 --> 1:18:13.320
<i>And that will help give us more
precision during the surgery.</i>

1:18:18.093 --> 1:18:23.330
<i>But my concern is, that the scar tissue
from her previous bypass surgery...</i>

1:18:24.733 --> 1:18:28.569
<i>may prevent us from completing
a full bypass.</i>

1:18:28.571 --> 1:18:32.540
<i>If it does, then we'll
perform a slee4ve on her.</i>

1:18:32.542 --> 1:18:35.943
<i>Both procedures will give her
an effective tool</i>

1:18:35.945 --> 1:18:38.679
<i>to keep losing weight
and making progress.</i>

1:18:38.681 --> 1:18:41.816
<i>But a bypass would be best</i>

1:18:41.818 --> 1:18:45.119
<i>since she already had one
weight loss surgery and failed.</i>

1:18:46.755 --> 1:18:48.456
Bring the robot.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:53.561
<i>But the same procedure will
reduce the stomach by 90%,</i>

1:18:53.563 --> 1:18:57.965
<i>leaving a small narrow tube
that looks similar to a sleeve,</i>

1:18:57.967 --> 1:19:01.368
<i>so the patient's food intake
is physically limited</i>

1:19:01.370 --> 1:19:04.638
<i>and the patient is less hungry.</i>

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:10.411
<i>So, this operation will give them an
opportunity to loose even more weight.</i>

1:19:10.413 --> 1:19:12.580
<i>So, it will help her
a great deal.</i>

1:19:12.582 --> 1:19:18.285
<i>But with a full bypass, it will also
bypass a portion of her intestines</i>

1:19:18.287 --> 1:19:21.489
<i>to reduce the amount of
calories she can absorb.</i>

1:19:21.491 --> 1:19:26.327
<i>So, it will be an added bonus
to help her out even more,</i>

1:19:26.329 --> 1:19:30.898
<i>that we would normally wait on if
this was her first weight loss surgery.</i>

1:19:30.900 --> 1:19:34.735
<i>But we will have to see what's
possible here in the moment</i>

1:19:34.737 --> 1:19:38.305
<i>depending on the extend
of her scar tissue.</i>

1:19:41.576 --> 1:19:44.111
My name is Sebastian.
I'm Bianca's best friend,

1:19:44.113 --> 1:19:45.780
and I flew all the way out
from Charlotte, North Carolina.

1:19:45.782 --> 1:19:48.382
<i>It's been almost five hours
since they took her back.</i>

1:19:48.384 --> 1:19:49.483
So, I said goodbye to her,
gave her a hug.

1:19:49.485 --> 1:19:52.286
And told her I love her and
I'm here waiting on her.

1:19:52.288 --> 1:19:56.757
<i>I'm nervous for her and I've gone to the
nurses' station maybe three or four times now.</i>

1:19:56.759 --> 1:20:00.961
They kept telling me 45 minutes, and
they've told me that so far three times.

1:20:00.963 --> 1:20:02.563
And that has me
a little bit nervous.

1:20:02.565 --> 1:20:05.299
I'm praying for the best,
absolutely.

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:10.604
<i>[Dr. Now] She had a lot of scar
tissue that's being very problematic.</i>

1:20:10.606 --> 1:20:15.042
<i>So, with that looking like, we
can't safely do the full bypass,</i>

1:20:15.044 --> 1:20:17.211
<i>and we're gonna
have to do a sleeve.</i>

1:20:29.157 --> 1:20:31.392
Okay, we are almost done.

1:20:35.931 --> 1:20:38.232
Okay, all finished.

1:20:39.067 --> 1:20:41.468
Nurse, disconnect the robot.

1:20:47.142 --> 1:20:48.876
Room light on.

1:20:51.613 --> 1:20:56.550
<i>Bianca's surgery didn't go as planned
because she had a lot of scar tissue.</i>

1:20:56.552 --> 1:21:00.521
<i>We had to take a lot of scar
tissue to get inside the abdomen.</i>

1:21:00.523 --> 1:21:03.190
<i>So, there was no way to do
a bypass on her.</i>

1:21:03.192 --> 1:21:06.427
<i>So we had to improvise and
do another surgery.</i>

1:21:06.429 --> 1:21:10.431
<i>And we did a gastric sleeve
instead, and it will reduce the stomach</i>

1:21:10.433 --> 1:21:15.836
<i>by about 70%. And that should
give her a better chance to lose weight</i>

1:21:15.838 --> 1:21:19.440
because her stomach was very
dilated, so we made it much smaller.

1:21:19.442 --> 1:21:22.676
<i>So, this will be a very
helpful tool for her.</i>

1:21:22.678 --> 1:21:28.382
<i>My only concern is that she has
already failed one weight loss surgery</i>

1:21:28.384 --> 1:21:32.553
<i>so, a more aggressive tool would
have been better than a sleeve.</i>

1:21:32.555 --> 1:21:35.522
It is not that effective
as gastric bypass,

1:21:35.524 --> 1:21:39.727
<i>but it can yield the same
results in the long term,</i>

1:21:39.729 --> 1:21:43.797
<i>If Bianca is at this time, where
she is physically restricted</i>

1:21:43.799 --> 1:21:47.101
<i>from overeating.</i>

1:21:47.103 --> 1:21:50.404
<i>That leads her to
emotionally overeat.</i>

1:21:50.406 --> 1:21:55.175
<i>It's gonna be very important that
we get her to go to psychotherapy and</i>

1:21:55.177 --> 1:21:59.280
<i>that she sticks with that and she
keeps working on her emotional issues</i>

1:21:59.282 --> 1:22:03.384
<i>and learning healthy ways to
cope that aren't self-destructive.</i>

1:22:03.386 --> 1:22:07.554
<i>Because we have known from her
first weight loss surgery that over time,</i>

1:22:07.556 --> 1:22:13.594
<i>she will go back to bad habits if she doesn't
get at the core of what she needs this time.</i>

1:22:13.596 --> 1:22:16.563
<i>So, for the same reason that
she failed the first operation,</i>

1:22:16.565 --> 1:22:20.534
we need to make sure that she
doesn't fail the second operation.

1:22:20.536 --> 1:22:25.739
<i>And dealing with her emotional issues
is the only way to make sure of that.</i>

1:22:25.741 --> 1:22:28.709
<i>So that's what we need to do
long term.</i>

1:22:28.711 --> 1:22:32.613
<i>But right now, Bianca needs
to focus on recovering,</i>

1:22:32.615 --> 1:22:34.615
<i>and then when she goes home,</i>

1:22:34.617 --> 1:22:36.684
she will be on a liquid diet
for one month.

1:22:36.686 --> 1:22:40.654
<i>And she'll lose around
35 pounds in that time.</i>

1:22:40.656 --> 1:22:45.392
<i>And then if she stays on track,
she should lose 15 to 20 pounds</i>

1:22:45.394 --> 1:22:50.130
<i>a month after that until she
gets close to her target weight.</i>

1:22:50.132 --> 1:22:55.803
<i>She has shown me she is very determined
to pursue every obstacle she needs</i>

1:22:55.805 --> 1:23:00.708
<i>to keep moving forward. But Bianca
still has a lot of hard work ahead of her</i>

1:23:00.710 --> 1:23:03.243
<i>to get to where she needs.</i>

1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:21.195
<i>[Bianca] It's been a little
over a month since my surgery.</i>

1:23:21.197 --> 1:23:25.432
<i>I'm down to the 400s now,
and I'm feeling great.</i>

1:23:25.434 --> 1:23:29.403
<i>Dr. Now said my progress should
stay around 20 pounds a month now.</i>

1:23:29.405 --> 1:23:33.474
<i>So I'm working hard to maintain
that goal and stay on track.</i>

1:23:33.476 --> 1:23:37.011
<i>And I feel like it's getting
easier the more weight I lose.</i>

1:23:37.013 --> 1:23:40.948
<i>Because the more independent I become,
the more it inspires me to keep going.</i>

1:23:40.950 --> 1:23:42.716
Hi!

1:23:43.752 --> 1:23:47.821
<i>You know, I joined a gym and I'm doing
water aerobics two to three times a week.</i>

1:23:47.823 --> 1:23:51.358
<i>That's made my exercising
easier on my joints and bones.</i>

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.961
Nice, pound it off hard.
Come on.

1:23:53.963 --> 1:23:55.996
<i>But I'm finding things that I
enjoy trying,</i>

1:23:55.998 --> 1:23:58.766
<i>they get me out and moving
around as much as I can.</i>

1:23:58.768 --> 1:24:01.402
You got this.
Come on, let's work.

1:24:01.404 --> 1:24:03.570
<i>I've even been able
to get a new job.</i>

1:24:03.572 --> 1:24:06.507
<i>Working at a grocery store,
bagging groceries.</i>

1:24:06.509 --> 1:24:10.377
<i>So that's been a very big step
for me that I'm excited about.</i>

1:24:10.379 --> 1:24:13.280
Yeah, you ready to go home, We
gotta go get Simeon. You ready?

1:24:24.125 --> 1:24:28.028
- Today is the day you can play with us, right?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1:24:28.096 --> 1:24:29.363
Yeah!

1:24:29.898 --> 1:24:31.732
Feet up, Mommy.

1:24:31.734 --> 1:24:34.935
<i>[Bianca] But the thing that
I'm most excited about?</i>

1:24:34.937 --> 1:24:38.138
<i>My progress has led me
to do more with my kids.</i>

1:24:39.841 --> 1:24:41.442
Get over that way, you ready?

1:24:42.043 --> 1:24:43.177
Here.

1:24:43.211 --> 1:24:44.978
Here.

1:24:45.013 --> 1:24:46.947
Throw it to me.

1:24:49.050 --> 1:24:51.185
- Come on, Simeon.
- Okay.

1:24:51.419 --> 1:24:52.953
Come on.

1:24:53.455 --> 1:24:55.322
Come on, Marcia.

1:24:55.324 --> 1:24:58.192
- [Bianca] Good job, Marcia.
- [Simeon] Good job.

1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:00.194
You having fun?

1:25:00.628 --> 1:25:03.030
Good job, Simeon.

1:25:03.731 --> 1:25:06.733
<i>[Bianca] I'm keeping my focus
where it needs to keep going.</i>

1:25:06.735 --> 1:25:09.236
<i>And I'm not stopping until,
I get to my goal.</i>

1:25:09.238 --> 1:25:11.805
<i>Because I've missed out
on too much of my life.</i>

1:25:11.807 --> 1:25:16.310
<i>And my kids already. And I'm thankful
for the second chance I have with them.</i>

1:25:16.312 --> 1:25:20.481
<i>You know, I'm willing to do anything,
I can to give them a better life.</i>

1:25:20.483 --> 1:25:23.117
<i>So, there's nothing on this earth
that I will let mess it up for me.</i>

1:25:23.119 --> 1:25:26.386
All right, good job, Simeon.
Let's go, come on.

1:25:27.388 --> 1:25:29.189
[Simeon] Come on, Marcia.
