WEBVTT

00:20.172 --> 00:23.130
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:08.338 --> 01:11.463
Human beings come in three kinds:

01:14.547 --> 01:16.713
the living,

01:19.922 --> 01:21.963
the dead,

01:24.713 --> 01:28.005
and those who go to sea.

01:30.588 --> 01:32.380
Aristotle

01:49.797 --> 01:53.588
COAST OF SYRIA - TARTUS

03:41.755 --> 03:43.172
One happy fishing boat.

03:53.005 --> 03:55.797
That's merchant vessel 14,
still at slow speed.

03:57.213 --> 03:58.088
Sorry.

04:05.422 --> 04:07.713
I'd rather listen to the blue water.

04:09.338 --> 04:10.755
Tired, Socks?

04:12.088 --> 04:14.005
The name's Chanteraide, thanks.

04:49.047 --> 04:51.880
Incoming transmission
on the swimmers' frequency.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.297
Uniform.

04:53.672 --> 04:55.255
Uniform. Bravo.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.672
Ok, swimmers in position.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.088
Stand by to dive.
Request confirmation of pickup.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.672
- XO?
- Copy.

05:01.463 --> 05:03.088
Run a sit-rep first.

05:03.963 --> 05:07.130
Merchant vessel close, bearing 1-6-0.
Christened 14.

05:07.297 --> 05:08.755
- 1,000 m, matched.
- Confirmed.

05:08.922 --> 05:11.422
- Fishing boat, 1-9-0.
- 100 m, opening.

05:11.547 --> 05:12.922
- Matched.
- Surface all clear

05:13.047 --> 05:13.922
What's that?

05:22.713 --> 05:23.588
Shit!

05:24.755 --> 05:26.172
Frigate! Bearing 1-5-0.

05:26.297 --> 05:27.755
Just started moving.

05:27.922 --> 05:29.797
Contact. Frigate, bearing 1-5-1.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.380
Send it over.

05:31.588 --> 05:34.213
Holding on frigate at 8,000 m, 3 knots,

05:34.338 --> 05:35.588
course 3-5-0.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.255
- Keep on it.
- Copy.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.880
Socks, give us more. Classification?

05:40.047 --> 05:43.880
It transmitted with Polinom sonar
so the vessel must be Udaloy class.

05:44.005 --> 05:46.005
- Or modified Udaloy.
- So, Russian.

05:46.172 --> 05:48.255
Wait, I have ears on its prop.

05:51.297 --> 05:52.672
Dry cavitation.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.547
Galloping horse.

05:57.713 --> 05:59.880
104 rpm. Counting blades.

06:03.213 --> 06:04.755
Seven blades, so not Russian.

06:04.922 --> 06:07.713
Iranian frigate.
<i>Zarathustra</i>, to be precise.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.755
An Iranian vessel in Syrian waters?

06:10.172 --> 06:12.838
<i>Zarathustra</i> is a heck of a toy.
Rapid, well-armed.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.838
Torpedoes, rocket launchers, grenades.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.797
And one hell of an active sonar.

06:17.588 --> 06:19.255
High risk of detection.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.630
Plotter!

06:22.088 --> 06:23.547
When are we in its range?

06:23.713 --> 06:26.463
Contact<i> Zarathustra</i>, bearing 1-5-4.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.463
In one minute.

06:31.672 --> 06:33.922
How long to swimmer pickup?

06:35.047 --> 06:36.172
Four minutes.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.630
Hairy picking them up
next to an Iranian frigate.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.213
Could be fun.

06:44.338 --> 06:45.172
Listen up!

06:45.338 --> 06:48.130
Priority is avoiding counterdetection
by the frigate.

06:48.297 --> 06:50.255
Assume Ultra-Quiet State.

06:50.422 --> 06:52.005
Slippers on, not a sound.

06:53.422 --> 06:54.838
Assume Ultra-Quiet State.

06:55.005 --> 06:56.922
Swimmer pickup through torpedo tubes.

06:57.088 --> 06:58.213
Copy that.

06:59.172 --> 07:02.255
Delta, this is Control.
Clear tubes 3 and 4.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.630
Flood the tubes
to recover swimmers, locking inboard.

07:05.797 --> 07:07.172
<i>This is Delta, copy.</i>

07:07.297 --> 07:08.713
XO, acoustics favourable.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.838
We should slip through undetected.

07:11.005 --> 07:14.505
Maybe ask Kiwi
to quit vacuuming Delta Section.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.880
It's raising hell on sonar.

07:20.838 --> 07:23.463
Delta, kill the vacuum.
It annoys our Golden Ear.

07:23.630 --> 07:24.505
<i>Copy.</i>

07:24.672 --> 07:25.797
Anything else?

07:25.922 --> 07:28.338
Sure, the galley. As always.

07:31.338 --> 07:33.630
Shit, guys, porn flicks for breakfast.

07:33.797 --> 07:37.297
Mother Nature's remit.
At least, the hull's not vibrating.

07:37.463 --> 07:39.255
Ask the CO to come to Control.

08:29.255 --> 08:32.005
Captain, we're three minutes
from swimmer pickup.

08:32.338 --> 08:35.338
Iranian frigate detected.
No counterdetection but it's tight.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.463
Tubes 3 and 4 rigged for them.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.963
Suggest confirming pickup to swimmers.

08:40.172 --> 08:42.213
- Very good. Confirm.
- Copy, sir.

08:44.838 --> 08:46.172
Check this trace.

08:46.922 --> 08:48.755
It gives nothing on audio.

08:49.422 --> 08:50.547
Uniform.

08:51.338 --> 08:52.422
Wait.

09:04.172 --> 09:05.255
Sea bottom noise.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.005
- VTWA!
- Video Trace Without Audio!

09:08.130 --> 09:09.755
I repeat, VTWA!

09:09.880 --> 09:11.838
- On the 5.
- Bearing 3-5-5.

09:12.422 --> 09:13.630
Track it.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.463
Maybe something in the trace.

09:28.088 --> 09:29.797
Very weak, shifting.

09:34.088 --> 09:35.422
Very slow rhythm.

09:36.672 --> 09:37.797
Four beats.

09:39.588 --> 09:41.338
4-blade prop, weird.

09:41.463 --> 09:43.838
- Just a cargo ship. We're good.
- No.

09:43.963 --> 09:46.297
Slender trace, so it's running silent.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.088
Gotta be a sub.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.297
- There are no 4-blade subs.
- I know.

09:52.713 --> 09:55.130
Hold on, transient sound, same trace.

09:55.297 --> 09:56.713
Decide, this isn't the UN.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.088
Hear it?

09:58.255 --> 10:01.130
Got the transient
but for me it's biological.

10:01.755 --> 10:03.547
- Sperm whale?
- A sick one.

10:03.755 --> 10:07.588
I don't want poetry.
Whale or not? Sub or not?

10:07.755 --> 10:09.297
The pickup is a go or not?

10:09.422 --> 10:10.963
- Analysing.
- Move it!

10:11.088 --> 10:13.088
- Quit fussing.
- Sonar.

10:13.505 --> 10:16.088
Well-run, a sub is quieter than the sea.

10:17.338 --> 10:18.422
The swimmers!

10:20.380 --> 10:21.505
Romeo.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.755
Receiving code urgent.

10:23.922 --> 10:26.005
- They're in danger. Captain?
- Stand by.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.422
I want Golden Ear's classification first.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.005
Sir, blue procedure.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.630
Break away and come back in six hours.

10:32.755 --> 10:35.588
Classify it!
Something or nothing? Moving or not?

10:35.963 --> 10:37.755
It's no game. Speed it up.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.213
Come on, Socks!

10:40.963 --> 10:42.505
Four blades, so not a sub.

10:43.422 --> 10:45.880
But way too silent to be a cargo ship.

10:55.963 --> 10:57.630
Concentrate, Chanteraide.

10:58.755 --> 11:00.255
Go with your instinct.

11:00.838 --> 11:02.047
For me, it's nothing.

11:02.172 --> 11:03.838
Just another sperm whale.

11:04.672 --> 11:06.213
- We're overthinking.
- Back off.

11:20.922 --> 11:21.838
SIGNATURE UNKNOWN

11:34.630 --> 11:36.005
I trust you.

11:49.338 --> 11:50.922
Ok, it's not a submarine.

11:51.047 --> 11:52.463
I declassify.

11:52.630 --> 11:54.213
Good, no sub. Let's go!

11:54.380 --> 11:56.213
- Chops, confirm pickup.
- Copy.

11:57.213 --> 11:59.338
Confirmed. Swimmers will be at pickup.

12:03.588 --> 12:05.922
A sperm whale sub! Some golden ear!

12:06.047 --> 12:07.713
In position, one minute!

12:08.713 --> 12:10.463
Captain takes the boat.

12:41.255 --> 12:42.713
Sonar, bearing of the ping?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.172
Swimmers bearing 0-4-0. Come right.

12:45.588 --> 12:47.338
Confirmed. On the ping.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.213
Closing on datum Charlie 2.

12:49.922 --> 12:53.172
- Go!
- Come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.

12:53.297 --> 12:56.255
- Come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.
- Copy.

12:56.422 --> 12:59.088
Helm, come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.

12:59.713 --> 13:00.672
Very good.

13:08.838 --> 13:10.255
0-1-0.

13:11.505 --> 13:12.713
0-2-0.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.880
0-3-0.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.130
Bearing 0-4-5.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.547
- Very good.
- 1,300 m from swimmers.

13:19.713 --> 13:22.005
In five seconds, engine astern 3.

13:33.672 --> 13:38.005
- Go!
- Engine astern 3, reduce speed over 200m.

13:39.547 --> 13:41.047
Engine astern 3 adjusted.

13:41.463 --> 13:43.255
Speed 5 knots.

13:43.630 --> 13:45.130
4.8 knots, 4.5...

14:19.255 --> 14:20.130
Shit!

14:21.880 --> 14:23.213
Your sick sperm whale?

14:23.380 --> 14:24.463
Transient.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.755
It's back and it's no cargo ship.

14:27.297 --> 14:30.297
Possible sub, bearing 3-4-7.
Coming left, four blades.

14:30.463 --> 14:32.130
- No sub has four blades.
- I know.

14:32.588 --> 14:34.088
Poss-sub, bearing 3-4-7!

14:34.213 --> 14:36.005
I want a solution in five seconds!

14:36.547 --> 14:38.088
Five seconds for the solution.

14:38.213 --> 14:39.672
Silence! Possible sub!

14:43.255 --> 14:45.963
- Solution?
- Solution on poss-sub, at 2-2-0.

14:46.088 --> 14:47.380
Speed 5 knots. 3,000 m.

14:47.547 --> 14:50.463
Better solution.
5.5 knots for 2,900 m plotted.

14:50.630 --> 14:51.505
Solution adopted.

14:51.630 --> 14:52.547
Christened Sierra.

14:52.672 --> 14:55.880
Sierra adopted.
Classify poss-sub, bearing 2-1-0.

14:56.338 --> 14:57.630
2,900 m, 5.5 knots.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.255
Getting a blade beat.
Glug-glug cavitation!

15:00.380 --> 15:01.922
Poss-sub level 2 for Sierra.

15:02.047 --> 15:03.797
3-4-6 for Sierra.

15:04.088 --> 15:05.172
Identify it!

15:05.297 --> 15:06.338
No more fuckups.

15:06.505 --> 15:07.380
It's deviated!

15:08.755 --> 15:12.213
Level 3. Poss-sub 3 for Sierra.
Classified poss-sub 3!

15:12.338 --> 15:15.463
Unidentified sub means Echo procedure.
Break away.

15:17.713 --> 15:20.463
Swimmer pickup is our mission.
Speed it up!

15:21.338 --> 15:23.172
Sonar, keep tight on Sierra.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.463
- Torpedo, make ready a tube.
- Tube 1!

15:28.880 --> 15:31.672
Sir, 70 rpm, could be Chinese.

15:31.838 --> 15:33.172
4-blade Chinese? No.

15:33.797 --> 15:36.547
I know it's a stretch
but maybe Russian Cougar.

15:36.672 --> 15:39.088
- The Cougar isn't operational yet.
- Exactly.

15:39.213 --> 15:40.922
I don't see what else.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.588
Four blades, it's something new.

15:42.963 --> 15:45.297
Sick sperm whale? Baby cougar?

15:45.463 --> 15:46.755
You're losing it!

15:46.922 --> 15:48.880
We need you. Focus and identify.

15:49.047 --> 15:50.172
Get to work!

15:50.380 --> 15:51.213
Shit.

15:51.588 --> 15:53.755
Baby cougar transmits encrypted.

15:56.838 --> 15:58.922
Sir, I can't demodulate.

15:59.047 --> 16:01.297
It's giving us to the Iranian.

16:13.963 --> 16:15.838
- The wolf's call.
- The Iranian?

16:16.005 --> 16:19.088
- Their active sonar. It's detected us.
- XO...

16:20.172 --> 16:22.588
- Close up action stations.
- Action stations!

16:22.713 --> 16:24.380
Let's go, guys!

16:24.505 --> 16:26.172
Control, action stations. Put it out!

16:26.672 --> 16:27.922
<i>Action stations!</i>

16:31.338 --> 16:32.338
Get that kit on!

16:35.338 --> 16:36.630
Engine ahead 5.

16:36.797 --> 16:38.672
Control! Action stations closed up!

16:38.797 --> 16:41.963
So, never let Socks classify
without triple-checking.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.588
- What's that?
- A cuckoo!

17:00.505 --> 17:02.422
Don't let me see a scrap of skin!

17:03.088 --> 17:04.505
Gloves not good!

17:05.797 --> 17:07.338
It'll pass right over us.

17:12.088 --> 17:14.547
Sir, with the chopper buzzing us,
break away.

17:14.713 --> 17:16.380
Swimmers can't come in the tubes.

17:16.547 --> 17:18.297
I can't hold station under a chopper.

17:18.463 --> 17:19.713
Match in 700 m.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.963
Adopted. In 700 m.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.797
It's hopeless, we gotta go.

17:23.963 --> 17:26.963
- Where's the RPG the swimmers left?
- The unilateral?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.380
Go get it!

17:45.713 --> 17:47.005
Wolf's call, bearing 3-5-5.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.422
Sonar flooded. Fixing our position.

17:49.588 --> 17:51.213
What depth to escape their sonar?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.172
Three splashes on sonar!

18:27.338 --> 18:28.797
Depth charges!

18:31.088 --> 18:33.922
- Back from the screen!
- Shield your eyes!

18:38.963 --> 18:40.880
Damage reports to Control!

18:41.422 --> 18:43.088
Check all systems!

18:43.255 --> 18:44.380
We've lost sonar.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.422
Damage report? Do we have prop and helm?

19:10.588 --> 19:11.713
We've got the helm.

19:12.672 --> 19:15.713
Alert systems active? Sonar in how long?

19:15.838 --> 19:17.505
Alert systems active.

19:29.422 --> 19:31.338
In less than one minute, he's back.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.505
- Stand by to dive.
- No, surface!

19:34.255 --> 19:37.088
- That's suicide.
- With a chopper sitting on us!

19:37.547 --> 19:38.922
Sir, the RPG!

19:41.380 --> 19:43.463
Get the automatic! Surface now!

19:43.630 --> 19:44.797
- I'll go.
- No, me!

19:44.963 --> 19:46.713
XO, take the boat!

19:46.880 --> 19:48.547
We don't know the RPG works.

19:49.463 --> 19:51.130
XO takes the boat.

19:51.505 --> 19:53.922
Engine ahead 6.
Take her up. It'll be bumpy.

19:54.047 --> 19:55.880
Ahead 6, take her up.

19:56.005 --> 19:57.547
Blow all ballast!

19:58.255 --> 19:59.505
Climbing.

20:01.713 --> 20:03.505
Surface in 50 metres!

20:04.297 --> 20:05.630
40 metres!

20:06.422 --> 20:07.630
30 metres!

20:08.422 --> 20:11.047
Chopper holding station.
Fixing our position.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.797
Christened Hotel 3.

21:05.172 --> 21:06.338
I can't unlock it!

21:15.297 --> 21:16.463
Fire!

21:26.672 --> 21:29.338
- XO, swimmers closing.
- Engines to zero.

21:46.297 --> 21:47.797
- Shoot here!
- Fire!

21:47.922 --> 21:48.963
No!

23:40.630 --> 23:42.005
<i>... worse hour by hour.</i>

23:42.172 --> 23:46.505
<i>Finland calls for international support</i>
<i>against two Russian divisions</i>

23:47.005 --> 23:50.130
<i>that invaded its southern tip</i>
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

23:50.255 --> 23:51.797
<i>Europe's capitals are resigned</i>

23:51.922 --> 23:53.713
<i>to total apathy from America.</i>

23:53.880 --> 23:56.005
<i>The president of the Commission announced</i>

23:56.130 --> 23:58.922
<i>that Russia's aggression</i>
<i>should not go "unanswered".</i>

23:59.088 --> 24:01.755
<i>So this evening, what does Russia want?</i>

24:01.880 --> 24:03.338
<i>Are we at war?</i>

25:00.172 --> 25:01.463
FOUR BLADES

25:39.338 --> 25:41.630
<i>From the whole crew of the Titan.</i>

25:43.005 --> 25:44.255
To France's best CO.

25:49.672 --> 25:50.797
Thanks.

26:06.838 --> 26:08.672
Sorry about that classification.

26:11.588 --> 26:12.963
I'll find what it was.

26:17.547 --> 26:18.713
Put it out of your mind.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.172
We're small cogs in a big machine.

26:23.463 --> 26:24.838
Rest up now.

26:27.297 --> 26:29.255
I can't even close my eyes.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.713
Without hearing the wolf's call.

26:32.630 --> 26:33.963
Damn sonar!

26:38.005 --> 26:39.297
The wolf's call.

26:40.297 --> 26:43.047
That'll be my soundtrack
when I check out.

26:45.505 --> 26:46.838
For the <i>Titan</i>...

26:51.130 --> 26:52.422
To the <i>Titan</i>!

27:22.713 --> 27:23.797
Come in.

27:31.797 --> 27:32.963
Morning, captain.

27:34.505 --> 27:36.547
Captain, I request permission

27:36.672 --> 27:38.213
to continue research ashore

27:38.380 --> 27:40.713
and confirm my hypothesis
about that transient.

27:41.172 --> 27:43.130
Your hypotheses are done, Chanteraide.

27:43.922 --> 27:46.047
It's our job to take over analysis.

27:46.838 --> 27:49.088
Russian Cougar? Blind alley.

27:51.297 --> 27:53.963
It's no time to dump on the Russians.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.630
It's a powder keg.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.630
So what was the transient?

28:01.338 --> 28:02.797
Most likely, a drone.

28:02.963 --> 28:06.297
I thought of that too.
But I heard an epicycloidal reducer.

28:07.255 --> 28:08.963
Drones don't have reducers.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.880
And there was life on board.

28:13.297 --> 28:14.505
I heard it.

28:15.088 --> 28:16.005
Well, you...

28:17.463 --> 28:19.713
You hear life. Great.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.422
We calculate. Calculations work.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.422
We identified the drone model.

28:24.713 --> 28:26.005
The constructor.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.130
The signature. It all checks out.

28:32.838 --> 28:34.838
I've revoked your database access.

28:38.213 --> 28:41.297
I don't understand, sir.
I'm just asking to look.

28:42.213 --> 28:45.713
- I promised captain Grandchamp...
- Bullshit promises.

28:48.547 --> 28:50.380
Your flawed classification

28:51.630 --> 28:53.338
nearly cost us a submarine.

28:53.797 --> 28:57.088
Here at CIRA, we hang our heads in shame.

28:59.797 --> 29:01.547
Once and for all, Chanteraide,

29:01.713 --> 29:03.130
this is the military.

29:03.297 --> 29:04.505
Not art school.

29:07.130 --> 29:08.380
Morning, captain.

29:08.672 --> 29:11.797
- What does he want?
- It's the chopper, I guess.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.297
We're in shit, right?

29:15.797 --> 29:17.088
Check flies.

29:17.838 --> 29:18.755
All clear.

29:20.588 --> 29:22.630
You heard the President's speech?

29:28.922 --> 29:30.338
Morning, admiral.

29:30.588 --> 29:31.422
At ease.

29:37.088 --> 29:39.922
One lemon, two lemons, three lemons.

29:42.213 --> 29:43.338
Jackpot.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.505
First lemon.

29:47.338 --> 29:49.047
You provoke a crisis in Syria.

29:49.213 --> 29:51.255
Based on a flawed classification.

29:51.588 --> 29:52.463
Result...

29:52.588 --> 29:56.047
A chopper downed in blue water.
Our sub barely makes it back.

29:56.172 --> 29:58.463
Plus the chief of staff flips his lid.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.338
A biggie.

30:04.172 --> 30:05.422
Second lemon.

30:07.422 --> 30:10.422
The President dispatches
ground forces to Finland.

30:11.713 --> 30:15.297
The Russians threaten our ambassador
with an atomic warning.

30:16.588 --> 30:19.422
First time ever,
all lines of communication down.

30:23.005 --> 30:24.130
Third lemon.

30:26.797 --> 30:28.922
Presidential orders
to reinforce our posture.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.838
In other words,

30:30.963 --> 30:33.463
one nuclear ballistic sub in the water.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.130
Effective immediately.

30:35.797 --> 30:38.630
So three lemons in a row. Jackpot?

30:41.755 --> 30:43.797
Gentlemen, cancel your turkey orders.

30:50.338 --> 30:53.672
Fact is, you guys pulled off
an act of incredible bravery.

30:53.838 --> 30:56.797
When I commanded <i>Titan</i>,
I'd have done the same.

30:57.172 --> 30:58.005
So,

30:58.630 --> 30:59.880
Grandchamp...

31:01.297 --> 31:04.463
you are promoted
to a nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.505
The Navy's pride and joy is yours.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.505
The <i>Formidable</i>.

31:08.838 --> 31:12.547
Make immediate preparations.
A 10-week patrol, give or take.

31:13.297 --> 31:16.672
Admiral,
I promised my wife not to sail again.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.088
Grandchamp,

31:22.255 --> 31:23.672
we're at alert level 6.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.172
Deterrence for now. No more, no less.

31:28.213 --> 31:30.797
But those submarines are my children.

31:31.797 --> 31:33.755
Only the best will do for them.

31:34.255 --> 31:35.713
Whatever a president says.

31:37.797 --> 31:39.880
Remember when I recruited you?

31:41.172 --> 31:43.630
I said that one day I'd be thanking you.

31:51.838 --> 31:53.422
At your command, admiral.

31:55.672 --> 31:56.588
D'Orsi,

31:56.755 --> 31:58.838
you take command of <i>Titan</i>.

32:00.338 --> 32:02.172
You have a problem with that?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.755
- At your command, admiral.
- Very good.

32:05.922 --> 32:09.255
You'll escort <i>Formidable</i>
until it goes stealth in blue water.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.297
Then await instructions.

32:30.463 --> 32:31.672
Conversation ended.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.130
A 3RD FAILURE WILL RESULT IN ALERT.

33:48.838 --> 33:49.880
<i>At CIRA, we listen,</i>

33:50.547 --> 33:52.963
<i>we analyse and we interpret.</i>

33:53.130 --> 33:55.213
We listen, we analyse and we interpret.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.880
<i>After 60 days at sea?</i>

33:57.797 --> 34:00.255
Don't you have a wife
to walk in the woods?

34:01.172 --> 34:02.088
<i>Top secret.</i>

34:02.213 --> 34:03.922
<i>A wet noise.</i>

34:04.088 --> 34:06.172
<i>A feeling of mass.</i>

34:06.338 --> 34:07.297
May I introduce...

34:07.880 --> 34:09.547
<i>A wet noise.</i>

34:09.713 --> 34:11.005
<i>May I introduce</i>

34:11.422 --> 34:12.297
my wife.

34:12.672 --> 34:14.713
- My wife!
- Beatrice.

34:14.838 --> 34:15.838
<i>Hello.</i>

34:17.713 --> 34:19.130
BEATRICE7.

34:20.922 --> 34:25.338
A 3RD FAILURE WILL RESULT IN ALERT.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.255
Change your password.

34:33.963 --> 34:34.880
Or your wife.

34:39.422 --> 34:40.880
"Drone F-15.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.547
"Analysis by Fourier Transform."

34:56.130 --> 34:57.297
"Fourier Transform."

34:57.422 --> 34:58.963
<i>Harmonic Spectra.</i>

35:00.005 --> 35:01.713
- It's a classic.
- Never heard of it.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.963
Not my field.
Ask my colleague who's in tomorrow.

35:05.297 --> 35:06.880
It's urgent, actually.

35:07.130 --> 35:09.505
- Virginie? Diane's in?
- Upstairs.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.338
- I'll go see. Maybe she'll know.
- Thanks.

35:26.255 --> 35:28.672
Was it you, looking for a book?

35:31.213 --> 35:33.172
Diane, the bookshop owner.

35:37.672 --> 35:39.505
But I can come back later.

35:40.255 --> 35:41.255
No...

35:41.422 --> 35:42.797
Sure, sorry, yes.

35:45.255 --> 35:47.005
The Maths book. That's me.

35:47.130 --> 35:49.547
- <i>Harmonic Spectra</i>?
- Yes.

35:49.713 --> 35:51.797
The database says we have it.

35:51.963 --> 35:53.922
But I can't find it right now.

35:56.755 --> 35:59.005
Can you come back tomorrow morning?

36:00.963 --> 36:02.755
At what time tonight?

36:10.130 --> 36:13.255
Say,
when is my meeting with that publisher?

36:17.922 --> 36:20.588
Sorry about the book.
In theory, I had it.

36:20.713 --> 36:22.047
Turns out, not.

36:23.297 --> 36:26.213
Why a book on spectral harmonies?

36:26.755 --> 36:28.338
To analyse a sound.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.630
You're a musician?

36:31.255 --> 36:34.588
- I should've guessed.
- No, not a musician, an AWA.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.797
Sorry...

36:38.047 --> 36:39.838
Acoustic Warfare Analyst.

36:41.297 --> 36:42.463
No kidding.

36:43.088 --> 36:45.380
In real terms, what is acoustic warfare?

36:45.547 --> 36:46.797
Is it dangerous?

36:47.172 --> 36:50.380
It's identification
of acoustic manifestations.

36:51.713 --> 36:52.922
Sound signals.

36:53.755 --> 36:54.755
Sounds.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.255
You have perfect pitch?

36:57.505 --> 36:59.130
Yes, but it's irrelevant.

36:59.505 --> 37:00.880
That's something else.

37:03.047 --> 37:04.088
Alright.

37:10.005 --> 37:10.963
Sorry.

37:13.755 --> 37:16.047
It's intrusive. We don't know each other.

37:16.172 --> 37:17.380
No problem.

37:18.338 --> 37:21.338
- My actual first name is Prairie.
- Sorry?

37:21.922 --> 37:25.838
My parents thought
it was a typically French name.

37:25.963 --> 37:29.088
In fact, it sounds weird.
So here I go by Diane.

37:29.255 --> 37:30.338
Prairie?

37:34.713 --> 37:35.630
Alright.

37:44.088 --> 37:45.505
Sorry, what did...

37:46.797 --> 37:47.797
I can't...

37:48.630 --> 37:49.713
hear a thing.

38:00.672 --> 38:03.088
<i>The military is redeploying defence forces</i>

38:03.255 --> 38:05.963
<i>with the mobilisation</i>
<i>of three infantry regiments.</i>

38:06.130 --> 38:09.172
<i>Two squadrons of fighter pilots</i>
<i>are on constant alert.</i>

38:09.338 --> 38:12.963
<i>A nuclear ballistic missile submarine</i>
<i>will soon leave port.</i>

38:13.088 --> 38:16.088
<i>Its departure from Brest is imminent</i>

38:16.213 --> 38:18.005
<i>and its route is top secret.</i>

38:18.172 --> 38:21.297
<i>Michael, can Europe</i>
<i>assure its own defence?</i>

38:21.463 --> 38:22.797
<i>That's the big question.</i>

38:22.963 --> 38:25.588
<i>Many wonder</i>
<i>if Finland is worth dying for.</i>

38:25.755 --> 38:27.672
<i>The President has made a decision.</i>

38:27.838 --> 38:31.338
<i>"It is not a question</i>
<i>of dying for Finland,</i>

38:31.463 --> 38:33.588
<i>"but saving the very idea of Europe,"</i>

38:33.755 --> 38:36.672
<i>he declared a few hours ago</i>
<i>at the Brussels summit.</i>

38:54.547 --> 38:56.588
So that's acoustic warfare.

40:45.505 --> 40:48.922
I'm trying to get my head around
you living in there.

40:50.797 --> 40:53.047
Stroke of luck, meeting me.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.213
Thank goodness
we couldn't find your Maths book.

41:01.463 --> 41:02.547
Hold on...

41:04.047 --> 41:06.422
You knew all along you didn't have it?

41:06.838 --> 41:08.130
You planned it.

41:08.922 --> 41:09.797
What?

41:09.963 --> 41:10.922
No.

41:12.005 --> 41:13.547
It was in my database.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.130
We never clear the database,
that's the problem.

41:24.088 --> 41:25.463
You don't believe me?

41:26.755 --> 41:29.547
We have a procedure
that deletes automatically.

41:31.047 --> 41:32.880
A procedure to delete what?

41:33.672 --> 41:34.922
Books?

41:36.505 --> 41:38.005
Dismantled submarines.

41:38.838 --> 41:41.380
They're deleted
from the operational database.

41:54.172 --> 41:56.255
But not from the physical archives.

42:52.922 --> 42:54.547
EX-SOVIET BLOC

43:38.505 --> 43:39.672
That's it.

43:52.672 --> 43:53.880
Paired double prop.

43:54.755 --> 43:57.172
That explains the four blades
and the transient.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.172
<i>Timour III.</i>

44:01.838 --> 44:03.130
The Soviet terror.

44:06.213 --> 44:08.005
The hell they scrapped it.

44:16.088 --> 44:17.797
You're out of your mind.

44:19.047 --> 44:19.922
Captain...

44:20.838 --> 44:21.880
Look!

44:22.713 --> 44:23.838
Your cellphone.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.005
You are under arrest.

44:32.755 --> 44:33.880
Check that file.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.547
Captain!

44:38.713 --> 44:40.672
The transient is not a drone.

44:41.672 --> 44:44.380
It's a Russian nuclear sub.<i> Timour III</i>.

44:44.505 --> 44:46.672
Four blades, the same transient.

44:46.797 --> 44:48.880
Identical acoustic signatures.

44:53.672 --> 44:56.463
Including the asymmetry
due to shaft wear.

44:59.005 --> 45:01.088
Decommissioned years ago, in theory.

45:01.255 --> 45:03.255
In fact stowed away by the Russians.

45:03.422 --> 45:06.463
Until deletion from our database
by the procedure.

45:06.922 --> 45:08.588
And years later, there it is.

45:09.047 --> 45:10.088
Untouched.

45:10.547 --> 45:12.255
Unclassified, incognito.

45:14.547 --> 45:15.630
Captain!

45:25.922 --> 45:26.880
Shit!

45:52.380 --> 45:54.213
Your analysis checks out.

45:55.172 --> 45:59.088
The Brits faced the same rogue situation,
same transient.

45:59.213 --> 46:02.130
Cross-referencing data
leads us to the <i>Timour III</i>.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.338
Which sheds a different light
on your conduct,

46:05.672 --> 46:08.297
even if it remains
technically reprehensible.

46:10.588 --> 46:13.338
After discussions with the Admiral,

46:15.088 --> 46:16.713
this goes no further.

46:17.505 --> 46:18.588
This time.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.297
It rankles to tell you,

46:21.463 --> 46:24.422
but you may end up
on a nuclear ballistic missile sub.

46:25.505 --> 46:27.922
<i>Formidable</i>'s captain wants you aboard.

46:29.838 --> 46:31.963
<i>Formidable</i>'s captain wants me?

46:33.672 --> 46:34.838
I don't know him.

46:34.963 --> 46:36.672
The new one, you do.

46:37.588 --> 46:38.672
Grandchamp.

46:41.630 --> 46:43.713
He threw a hissy fit to get you.

46:48.130 --> 46:50.588
Don't get over-excited.
There's a test first.

46:51.172 --> 46:53.088
The Admiral has the last word.

46:53.797 --> 46:55.838
Get into uniform. Training starts today.

46:56.963 --> 46:57.922
Yes, sir.

47:24.713 --> 47:27.547
Russian sonar, low frequency. Type Shark.

47:27.672 --> 47:28.755
Vessel?

47:28.880 --> 47:30.213
K-138.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.672
New generation.

47:33.547 --> 47:35.255
Plus five dolphins, two babies.

47:53.547 --> 47:54.380
Something there.

47:57.255 --> 47:58.297
Submarine.

48:00.005 --> 48:00.880
Nuclear propulsion.

48:01.005 --> 48:02.130
Attack submarine.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.297
Not American.

48:05.005 --> 48:06.047
Not British.

48:09.838 --> 48:11.172
It could be the <i>Kiev.</i>

48:12.963 --> 48:15.338
No, there's an egg-whisk tone.

48:22.713 --> 48:24.797
Nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

48:24.963 --> 48:26.130
SSBN.

48:27.422 --> 48:28.505
Before going stealth.

48:28.630 --> 48:31.880
If it had gone stealth,
you wouldn't hear it, Socks.

48:32.005 --> 48:34.338
Even the machine wouldn't detect it.

48:35.130 --> 48:36.005
Anyway...

48:36.505 --> 48:37.713
FYI, it's...

48:37.880 --> 48:38.880
<i>Formidable.</i>

48:39.588 --> 48:40.713
Really?

48:41.380 --> 48:42.630
Not <i>Invincible</i>?

48:43.588 --> 48:45.713
They're identical, constructed together.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.963
Check spectral analysis.
<i>Formidable</i> first.

48:49.380 --> 48:51.088
Then the other.

48:53.922 --> 48:55.547
You see any difference?

49:38.463 --> 49:41.797
Was <i>Formidable</i>'s turbine remachined
due to damage?

49:48.463 --> 49:49.755
The dream team.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.297
- Ok, Socks?
- D'Orsi.

49:51.713 --> 49:53.213
Sorry, admiral, didn't see you.

49:54.255 --> 49:55.005
Well...

49:56.588 --> 49:59.088
Chanteraide, confirmed.
Boarding tomorrow, 4 am.

49:59.630 --> 50:00.588
Well played, son.

50:02.588 --> 50:04.797
- You did your medical?
- All good.

50:04.963 --> 50:06.630
Not on antidepressants?

50:07.463 --> 50:09.172
Shows up in your urine.

50:09.338 --> 50:10.630
The SSBN

50:10.755 --> 50:12.172
isn't the Love Boat.

50:13.088 --> 50:17.255
The mission is, ready to fire
in under an hour on presidential orders.

50:18.755 --> 50:21.172
You're the country's life insurance.

50:23.047 --> 50:24.130
Copy that.

50:24.505 --> 50:27.380
3,000 years of civilisation
did not bring peace.

50:28.005 --> 50:29.255
Only deterrence...

50:29.588 --> 50:31.713
Effective deterrence depends on

50:32.547 --> 50:33.880
sailors keeping quiet.

50:34.713 --> 50:37.005
"Diwel didrouz maro pa denn."

50:38.338 --> 50:39.338
What's that?

50:39.463 --> 50:40.838
The SSBN motto.

50:41.338 --> 50:42.380
Your new home.

50:43.755 --> 50:46.422
"Invisible and silent, I bring death."

50:48.672 --> 50:49.922
Good luck, son.

50:51.547 --> 50:52.838
Keep on the PIM.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
Captain.

52:04.213 --> 52:05.463
<i>Titan</i>, red company.

52:05.880 --> 52:06.963
Attention!

52:08.213 --> 52:09.338
Eyes front.

52:12.338 --> 52:15.130
Company mustered and correct.
At your command, sir.

52:16.713 --> 52:17.922
Welcome aboard.

52:48.463 --> 52:50.588
<i>Formidable</i> blue company, attention!

52:59.505 --> 53:00.380
XO,

53:01.047 --> 53:02.213
take over.

53:42.422 --> 53:43.672
XO, take over.

53:44.922 --> 53:45.922
At ease.

53:46.755 --> 53:47.922
Attention!

53:48.088 --> 53:50.880
Roll call. Respond present and board.

53:51.047 --> 53:52.213
- Abbad!
- Present.

53:52.380 --> 53:53.505
- Aboulker!
- Present.

54:08.547 --> 54:11.380
The doc found cannabis
in your urine sample.

54:17.213 --> 54:19.047
He declared you unfit to serve.

54:25.130 --> 54:26.838
I will not challenge it.

54:28.880 --> 54:32.505
I must be able to rely on each man
operating at 100%.

54:50.338 --> 54:52.588
Captain Grandchamp aboard!

57:08.130 --> 57:09.297
Stop! Gates closing.

57:09.422 --> 57:10.797
Fortress procedure!

57:14.797 --> 57:16.297
Loïc, give me a hand!

57:30.797 --> 57:32.005
Move!

57:32.963 --> 57:34.172
Coming through.

57:34.338 --> 57:36.963
- What's going on?
- Nuke R-30. Fired from Bering Sea.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.505
The Russians are moving!

58:02.963 --> 58:04.338
Keep the info coming.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.922
Faster!

58:07.338 --> 58:08.505
President's office.

58:11.797 --> 58:14.547
The President is at Jupiter Command.

58:14.672 --> 58:16.547
Upgrade to alert level 10.

58:17.213 --> 58:19.880
Tell Grandchamp to go stealth immediately.

58:22.505 --> 58:23.963
Keep the info coming!

58:24.922 --> 58:26.297
25 minutes left.

58:33.547 --> 58:34.797
FORTRESS PROCEDURE ACTIVATED

58:41.338 --> 58:43.338

58:43.505 --> 58:44.547
Copy.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.005
Very good.

58:46.172 --> 58:47.797
What's that trace, north?

58:49.255 --> 58:50.422
Nothing. The 15.

58:50.922 --> 58:52.172
Identify contact 11.

58:52.338 --> 58:53.963
We have 11, bearing 2-3-9.

58:54.922 --> 58:56.172
Echo, Foxtrot.

58:58.005 --> 58:59.797
Echo, X-ray.

59:01.172 --> 59:03.005
<i>Formidable</i> assuming stealth mode,

59:03.172 --> 59:05.755
thanks us for our company
and wishes us the best.

59:05.922 --> 59:08.880
Salute<i> Formidable</i>'s formidability
and wish her well.

59:09.005 --> 59:10.005
Copy, captain.

59:10.172 --> 59:11.588
Plotting priority on 12.

59:11.713 --> 59:14.172
Mission accomplished.
No further instructions.

59:14.547 --> 59:16.547
If not on watch, stand down.

59:17.672 --> 59:18.880
Guys...

59:19.547 --> 59:21.838
Now or never for a workout or shower.

59:22.005 --> 59:23.088
Or even both.

59:23.588 --> 59:24.713
In the right order.

59:28.672 --> 59:30.880
<i>Formidable</i>, bearing 0-2-3. Losing her.

1:00:07.005 --> 1:00:09.713
NATO satellites confirm impact
on French territory.

1:00:09.838 --> 1:00:12.713
- Paris spoke to the US?
- They say it's 100% Russian.

1:00:12.838 --> 1:00:15.588
Coming from Russian waters
doesn't make it Russian.

1:00:15.755 --> 1:00:17.672
Russia signals it's not them.

1:00:17.797 --> 1:00:19.838
It's not like they'd admit it.

1:00:20.338 --> 1:00:23.838
Paris orders not to raise the alarm,
while impact can be avoided.

1:00:23.963 --> 1:00:26.463
By interception with a ballistic missile.

1:00:27.047 --> 1:00:28.672
They've tested that system?

1:00:29.172 --> 1:00:31.338
- No.
- Clay-pigeon shooting.

1:00:33.213 --> 1:00:34.672
I hate clay-pigeon shooting.

1:00:36.297 --> 1:00:40.088
Sir, our sub in the Bering Sea says
it recorded missile launch.

1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:43.380
- Launch vessel had a four-blade prop.
- Four blades?

1:00:44.797 --> 1:00:46.880
<i>Timour III</i>. Put it on that machine.

1:00:47.005 --> 1:00:49.547
I want its signature.
Where's CIRA and his ears?

1:00:49.672 --> 1:00:50.588
Not inside here.

1:00:50.713 --> 1:00:52.088
Fuck, we need him now!

1:00:52.213 --> 1:00:53.838
We have no one to listen?

1:00:54.005 --> 1:00:54.963
Admiral...

1:00:56.672 --> 1:00:57.922
Socks, what the hell?

1:00:58.047 --> 1:00:59.713
Isn't it spliff time?

1:01:00.338 --> 1:01:01.880
Grab a seat and listen in.

1:01:04.047 --> 1:01:05.005
Better and better.

1:01:06.630 --> 1:01:09.005
I'm sending sub and launch audio.

1:01:11.588 --> 1:01:12.505
Well?

1:01:12.630 --> 1:01:13.963
I have audio.

1:01:21.130 --> 1:01:22.588
Yes, that's <i>Timour III</i>.

1:01:23.963 --> 1:01:25.130
You're sure?

1:01:31.547 --> 1:01:34.172
- Grandchamp's in stealth mode?
- Affirmative.

1:01:35.380 --> 1:01:39.172
Transmit info to the Chief of Staff.
Russian launch confirmed.

1:01:42.672 --> 1:01:43.547
Here we go.

1:01:45.588 --> 1:01:46.630
Buckle up.

1:01:56.338 --> 1:01:57.755
Depth 500 m.

1:02:01.088 --> 1:02:03.255
Captain, clear ahead, bearing 1-5-3.

1:02:03.380 --> 1:02:06.047
Anti-tracking manoeuvres complete.
We're undetectable.

1:02:06.213 --> 1:02:07.338
Very good.

1:02:07.588 --> 1:02:09.005

1:06:12.422 --> 1:06:14.422
Update the scenario. Let's go!

1:06:15.338 --> 1:06:17.130
- Admiral, an anomaly.
- What?

1:06:17.505 --> 1:06:19.547
- There's a...
- Spit it out!

1:06:19.838 --> 1:06:22.297
Missile first-stage separation is off.

1:06:22.463 --> 1:06:23.797
- The booster should...
- Chanteraide!

1:06:23.922 --> 1:06:25.463
Too late.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:26.713
Admiral, I...

1:06:27.213 --> 1:06:29.505
I've heard R-30 launches.
This is not one.

1:06:30.630 --> 1:06:32.130
Not with a payload, at least.

1:06:32.255 --> 1:06:33.380
Who let him in?

1:06:33.755 --> 1:06:34.838
Check the spectral.

1:06:34.963 --> 1:06:36.172
Is he high?

1:06:36.338 --> 1:06:37.963
Please, just take a look.

1:06:38.088 --> 1:06:39.380
Cut the crap here!

1:06:40.338 --> 1:06:41.922
Go and listen!

1:06:52.005 --> 1:06:52.922
Well?

1:06:53.047 --> 1:06:54.255
He's right.

1:06:55.172 --> 1:06:56.880
Weight-resistance ratio is off.

1:06:57.255 --> 1:06:59.963
- The issue's the weight.
- Too heavy or light?

1:07:00.088 --> 1:07:01.755
Too light. 20%.

1:07:02.797 --> 1:07:03.922
No nuclear warhead?

1:07:16.213 --> 1:07:18.380
Yes. That explains the ratio.

1:07:19.338 --> 1:07:21.547
Come on. You too, Socks.

1:07:44.838 --> 1:07:47.880

1:07:55.463 --> 1:07:57.713
No, get a message to him. It's urgent!

1:08:21.838 --> 1:08:23.297
<i>This is the captain.</i>

1:08:24.713 --> 1:08:27.422
<i>A major attack is ongoing</i>
<i>on French territory.</i>

1:08:28.547 --> 1:08:30.088
<i>Our orders have changed.</i>

1:08:30.213 --> 1:08:33.422
The President has ordered me
to effect a counterstrike.

1:08:34.255 --> 1:08:37.838
<i>I authenticated the order</i>
<i>with the executive officer.</i>

1:08:38.838 --> 1:08:40.005
<i>XO, here.</i>

1:08:40.130 --> 1:08:43.380
I confirm authentication
of the President's orders.

1:08:47.005 --> 1:08:47.838
<i>Admiral?</i>

1:08:48.005 --> 1:08:51.338
General, a submarine
heard the R-30 launch in the Bering.

1:08:51.838 --> 1:08:54.630
My analysts assert
nuclear payload is absent.

1:08:57.005 --> 1:08:58.922
I repeat. The missile is empty.

1:08:59.088 --> 1:09:01.297
<i>You vouch for your analysts?</i>

1:09:01.713 --> 1:09:02.588
Yes.

1:09:02.713 --> 1:09:03.797
<i>Three hypotheses...</i>

1:09:03.963 --> 1:09:06.380
<i>- General, Washington calling!</i>
<i>- I'll take it.</i>

1:09:06.547 --> 1:09:09.755
- General!
- <i>Sorry, admiral, the Secretary of State.</i>

1:09:11.088 --> 1:09:12.255
Shit!

1:09:12.672 --> 1:09:15.797
Why would the Russians
fire an empty missile?

1:09:15.922 --> 1:09:18.588
A counterstrike is inevitable.
It's absurd!

1:09:24.297 --> 1:09:25.963
- General?
<i>- Equation's changed.</i>

1:09:26.088 --> 1:09:27.672
<i>According to the Americans,</i>

1:09:27.797 --> 1:09:30.880
<i>Two years ago, funds were wired</i>
<i>to an ex-Russian admiral,</i>

1:09:31.047 --> 1:09:33.838
<i>formerly in command of the Pacific fleet.</i>
<i>120 million euros.</i>

1:09:34.005 --> 1:09:35.963
<i>The going rate for a submarine?</i>

1:09:36.838 --> 1:09:38.963
For a scrapped <i>Timour III</i>, sure.

1:09:39.130 --> 1:09:42.963
<i>Via various offshore accounts,</i>
<i>the money came from Al-Jadida.</i>

1:09:43.088 --> 1:09:44.838
<i>The US forgot to mention it.</i>

1:09:45.005 --> 1:09:48.088
- The<i> Timour III</i> is in jihadist hands?
<i>- Looks that way.</i>

1:09:48.213 --> 1:09:50.713
That's why there's no nuclear payload.

1:09:51.338 --> 1:09:53.005
And we have riposted.

1:09:54.922 --> 1:09:56.922
They're triggering nuclear war.

1:10:02.088 --> 1:10:03.005
Very smart.

1:10:03.172 --> 1:10:04.505
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

1:10:11.255 --> 1:10:12.755
The perfect trap.

1:10:14.088 --> 1:10:16.922
Down to the <i>Timour III</i>
buzzing you in Syria.

1:10:17.088 --> 1:10:19.880
To be sure
we'd peg the launch on the Russians.

1:10:20.505 --> 1:10:22.630
It was all so we'd reclassify it?

1:10:27.588 --> 1:10:28.630
General?

1:10:28.797 --> 1:10:31.630
<i>I'm with the President. Cancel the strike.</i>

1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:38.963
The Navy has procedures
that we respect unfortunately.

1:10:39.130 --> 1:10:42.463
But there is no procedure
for recalling an SSBN strike.

1:10:43.255 --> 1:10:44.797
It's the principle of deterrence.

1:10:44.963 --> 1:10:47.755
<i>I know that.</i>
<i>Try to contact the submarine captain.</i>

1:10:48.755 --> 1:10:50.713
From reception of the strike order,

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:53.713
the sub's captain
must consider anyone who intervenes

1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:56.172
as potentially working for the enemy.

1:10:56.630 --> 1:10:59.922
Nobody can prevent Grandchamp
from launching that missile.

1:11:00.422 --> 1:11:01.755
Not me, not you.

1:11:02.547 --> 1:11:03.797
Not even the President.

1:11:05.713 --> 1:11:08.297
<i>Our only option</i>
<i>is to neutralise the captain.</i>

1:11:11.838 --> 1:11:13.922
General, I am under your command

1:11:14.088 --> 1:11:15.797
but I cannot do what I cannot do.

1:11:15.963 --> 1:11:17.922
<i>How long before Grandchamp launches?</i>

1:11:18.047 --> 1:11:19.505
Less than one hour.

1:11:19.797 --> 1:11:21.630
<i>It's that or apocalypse.</i>

1:11:23.547 --> 1:11:26.963
From now on, our sole priority
is this strategic strike.

1:11:27.797 --> 1:11:31.088
<i>It's a turning-point in history.</i>
<i>We have all trained</i>

1:11:31.213 --> 1:11:32.880
for this situation.

1:11:33.130 --> 1:11:34.380
The time has come

1:11:34.505 --> 1:11:36.630
<i>to do our duty. Your duty.</i>

1:11:36.963 --> 1:11:39.172
<i>Formidable</i>, blue company,

1:11:40.755 --> 1:11:43.047
I'm relying on you. Over and out.

1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:49.005
I spent my life
teaching kids to respect the procedure.

1:11:49.505 --> 1:11:52.380
To keep the country safe,
trust the system.

1:11:54.713 --> 1:11:56.297
Now I neutralise those kids?

1:11:56.422 --> 1:11:57.588
Action stations!

1:11:59.963 --> 1:12:01.880
You're head of our nuclear force.

1:12:03.338 --> 1:12:04.672
Grandchamp will listen.

1:12:04.797 --> 1:12:08.838
If we abandon procedure,
our deterrence will be discredited.

1:12:09.297 --> 1:12:11.047
Grandchamp cannot obey me.

1:12:11.172 --> 1:12:12.630
I could be manipulated.

1:12:12.755 --> 1:12:14.963
It's why there's the procedure.

1:12:15.130 --> 1:12:17.338
Admiral, you say it year after year.

1:12:17.463 --> 1:12:18.755
It's drilled into us.

1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:21.672
"If it happens,
there'll be doubts and decoys.

1:12:22.422 --> 1:12:24.422
"And men demanding we recall..."

1:12:24.547 --> 1:12:27.130
Hundreds of millions of lives
are at risk!

1:12:27.255 --> 1:12:28.547
- Don't crack!
- Cut it out!

1:12:29.422 --> 1:12:30.922
You think I don't know?

1:12:31.047 --> 1:12:33.588
<i>Formidable</i>'s gone stealth.
We've no idea where.

1:12:33.755 --> 1:12:37.047
It just went stealth.
It can't be far from <i>Titan</i>.

1:12:37.172 --> 1:12:39.213
No sonar can detect it.

1:12:39.380 --> 1:12:40.672
What do you suggest?

1:12:49.713 --> 1:12:50.672
It's now, admiral.

1:12:50.838 --> 1:12:51.963
No, admiral.

1:13:27.963 --> 1:13:30.922
Couldn't you wear normal shoes
on a day like this?

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:36.130
Base was out of them?

1:13:39.255 --> 1:13:40.588
Going to the dogs.

1:13:42.130 --> 1:13:44.255
Not surprising coming from you.

1:13:45.088 --> 1:13:47.963
Didn't you spend three months
in a sub in your socks?

1:13:51.505 --> 1:13:53.630
You certainly earned your nickname.

1:13:54.797 --> 1:13:56.963
Nice. What goes around comes around.

1:13:59.255 --> 1:14:00.880
<i>Admiral, this is CIRA.</i>

1:14:01.338 --> 1:14:03.380
<i>R-30 impact in the Compiègne forest.</i>

1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:05.297
<i>No damage reported.</i>

1:14:05.463 --> 1:14:06.963
<i>No nuclear warhead.</i>

1:15:11.588 --> 1:15:14.255
Admiral, to what do I owe the honour?

1:15:14.797 --> 1:15:17.213
To all hands, this is Alfost!

1:15:17.755 --> 1:15:19.338
We fell into a trap.

1:15:19.713 --> 1:15:22.963
<i>Formidable</i> was ordered
to fire a nuclear missile at Russia.

1:15:23.463 --> 1:15:26.088
If the missile is launched,
the Russians counter.

1:15:26.255 --> 1:15:27.755
I'll let you join the dots.

1:15:29.047 --> 1:15:32.755
What I'm about to say
is hard to take in, and harder to say.

1:15:33.547 --> 1:15:36.297
Our priority
is to stop Grandchamp launching.

1:15:37.213 --> 1:15:38.755
By all means necessary.

1:15:40.047 --> 1:15:42.172
This defies procedure, why trust you?

1:16:00.213 --> 1:16:01.713
Your Captain speaking.

1:16:03.672 --> 1:16:05.088
Action stations!

1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:07.172
In position.

1:16:09.297 --> 1:16:11.463
<i>Formidable</i>'s last known position?

1:16:12.005 --> 1:16:13.713
They went stealth in sector 7.

1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:14.880
Sector 7?

1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.630
In his shoes, where'd you go?

1:16:19.797 --> 1:16:21.338
Grandchamp is pure reason.

1:16:21.463 --> 1:16:23.255
He calculates for optimal outcomes.

1:16:23.422 --> 1:16:24.922
Optimal in this case?

1:16:25.088 --> 1:16:27.630
First up, whatever saves lives.

1:16:27.797 --> 1:16:29.672
Saves lives? Meaning?

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:35.047
With nuclear missiles,

1:16:35.338 --> 1:16:38.797
to avoid collateral damage
you reset position at launch?

1:16:39.963 --> 1:16:41.713
It's not protocol but...

1:16:43.172 --> 1:16:46.880
To keep the hit clean,
it's best to fix position before launch.

1:16:47.797 --> 1:16:48.713
He'll do that.

1:16:48.838 --> 1:16:49.880
For sure.

1:16:51.547 --> 1:16:53.130
But he can't surface.

1:16:55.130 --> 1:16:56.588
He needs a magic point.

1:16:56.755 --> 1:16:58.547
Bring up nearby magic points.

1:16:58.713 --> 1:17:01.422
- Magic points?
- True, we don't have them.

1:17:01.755 --> 1:17:02.797
Only SSNBs do.

1:17:04.130 --> 1:17:06.213
I commanded an SSNB. I need to remember.

1:17:06.380 --> 1:17:07.463
Sector 7.

1:17:07.630 --> 1:17:09.380
Sector 8, two of them.

1:17:09.547 --> 1:17:10.672
Mapped peaks.

1:17:10.797 --> 1:17:12.713
Calypso here and Circe here.

1:17:12.838 --> 1:17:14.005
ETA?

1:17:15.547 --> 1:17:17.297
Calypso, for him, ten minutes.

1:17:18.463 --> 1:17:19.588
For us, 13.

1:17:19.755 --> 1:17:21.588
- Too late.
- Circe...

1:17:22.505 --> 1:17:24.338
We arrive pretty much simultaneously.

1:17:24.505 --> 1:17:26.130
We need him to go for Circe.

1:17:26.588 --> 1:17:27.838
Circe.

1:17:30.130 --> 1:17:31.880
- Chops...
- Admiral?

1:17:32.713 --> 1:17:35.547
Transmit to base
to send two aircraft over Calypso.

1:17:35.713 --> 1:17:38.922
They cover the sea
with sonobuoys and crank it up.

1:17:39.047 --> 1:17:40.880
See if the octopuses like AC/DC.

1:17:41.005 --> 1:17:41.922
Yes, sir.

1:17:42.213 --> 1:17:44.588
Transmitting code 5, confirmed Alfost.

1:17:49.755 --> 1:17:51.630
Grandchamp winds up in a moshpit

1:17:52.380 --> 1:17:54.422
and has to swing over to Circe.

1:17:55.463 --> 1:17:57.213
XO, take us to Circe.

1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:58.422
Romeo.

1:17:58.713 --> 1:18:00.130
Plotter, bearing to Circe?

1:18:01.672 --> 1:18:02.547
Alpha.

1:18:02.672 --> 1:18:04.005
2-3-2.

1:18:06.755 --> 1:18:09.172
CALYPSO MAGIC POINT
47°N 8°W

1:18:28.088 --> 1:18:28.922
Analysis?

1:18:29.088 --> 1:18:31.005
Sonobuoys. Type Dicasse.

1:18:31.172 --> 1:18:32.380
Lots of them.

1:18:32.547 --> 1:18:34.713
Dicasse, that's our Navy. What the hell!

1:18:35.255 --> 1:18:36.630
It's weird.

1:18:36.797 --> 1:18:38.463
It's gotta be Alfost.

1:18:39.047 --> 1:18:40.255
Captain?

1:18:41.838 --> 1:18:43.963
Distance from Magic Point 2?

1:18:44.088 --> 1:18:45.838
Circe, 6,000 m at 2-8-4.

1:18:46.755 --> 1:18:48.463
Captain takes the boat.

1:18:48.588 --> 1:18:50.588
Set course 2-8-4. Ahead 5.

1:18:51.005 --> 1:18:53.672
Captain, someone's messing with us.

1:18:53.797 --> 1:18:57.005
Maybe we should fire with less precision.
Time's short.

1:18:57.922 --> 1:18:59.797
No, we continue the sequence.

1:19:05.047 --> 1:19:07.172
- I'll be in position.
- Very good.

1:19:13.422 --> 1:19:15.797
<i>Missile room. Running checks.</i>

1:19:34.213 --> 1:19:35.880
Magic point 2,500 m.

1:19:40.338 --> 1:19:42.047
Why no insignia?

1:19:43.672 --> 1:19:45.880
Don't you want to die looking good?

1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:51.713
What's this eyesore? You need comfort?

1:19:51.880 --> 1:19:53.380
You're ballet dancers?

1:19:58.047 --> 1:20:00.630
If the computer's bust,
why isn't it replaced?

1:20:00.797 --> 1:20:02.380
Because this is France.

1:20:05.088 --> 1:20:06.547
Only one works.

1:20:06.672 --> 1:20:08.880
Arriving at Circe. Let's reset now.

1:20:09.005 --> 1:20:11.463
- Chops, take over.
- Yes, sir.

1:20:14.297 --> 1:20:15.797
Stand by to reset.

1:20:16.338 --> 1:20:17.588
Ready.

1:20:18.547 --> 1:20:19.880
Reset.

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:32.005
Reset complete.

1:20:32.172 --> 1:20:34.047
Position margin of error, 100 m.

1:20:34.213 --> 1:20:35.755
Optimal margin reached.

1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.380
Attain launch depth.
When we're there, we fire the missile.

1:20:43.297 --> 1:20:44.880
Waking missile.

1:20:47.213 --> 1:20:50.213
Magic point 1,000 m. Entering reset zone.

1:20:50.338 --> 1:20:52.380
At this distance,
try the underwater phone.

1:20:52.505 --> 1:20:53.713
Wait!

1:20:54.755 --> 1:20:58.422
Do that and it's simple.
They'll hear and locate us.

1:20:58.547 --> 1:21:01.297
Either they answer or they apply protocol

1:21:01.422 --> 1:21:03.047
and torpedo us.

1:21:03.172 --> 1:21:04.713
Stand by to engage.

1:21:06.005 --> 1:21:07.630
Heuristic, as methods go.

1:21:08.338 --> 1:21:09.463
Quit the philosophy.

1:21:10.505 --> 1:21:11.880
Yes, sir.

1:21:13.088 --> 1:21:14.422
But it's Grandchamp.

1:21:16.213 --> 1:21:18.755
- Torpedo, prepare to fire.
- Copy.

1:21:21.172 --> 1:21:23.088
Tubes one to four ready.

1:21:24.005 --> 1:21:25.505
Transmitting by TUUM.

1:21:25.672 --> 1:21:26.672
Copy that. TUUM.

1:21:26.838 --> 1:21:29.380
As soon as you hear a sound,
give the alert.

1:21:29.505 --> 1:21:30.463
Copy.

1:21:46.213 --> 1:21:48.547
I have three frequencies, no bearing.

1:21:48.713 --> 1:21:50.547
- Check the lawn.
- Marked frequencies?

1:21:50.672 --> 1:21:52.880
Yes. Possible submarine.

1:21:53.047 --> 1:21:54.297
Watch out, poss-sub!

1:21:58.005 --> 1:21:59.880
Control, get me the XO.

1:22:00.755 --> 1:22:03.797
XO, get back here to Control.
Poss-sub contact.

1:22:04.088 --> 1:22:05.422
<i>Copy that.</i>

1:22:06.338 --> 1:22:07.713
Examine each trace.

1:22:16.255 --> 1:22:17.255
TUUM!

1:22:21.505 --> 1:22:23.213
The poss-sub. Plot it.

1:22:23.380 --> 1:22:25.297
Bearing on TUUM? Cross-check.

1:22:25.463 --> 1:22:27.213
- 0-2-8.
- Bearing 0-2-8!

1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:29.338
- 1,000 m.
- Torpedo standing by.

1:22:29.463 --> 1:22:31.588
Bravo Charlie 3.

1:22:32.005 --> 1:22:33.922
<i>This is Zulu Delta 4.</i>

1:22:34.047 --> 1:22:35.505
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1:22:35.672 --> 1:22:38.172
Zulu Delta 4, that's <i>Titan</i>. We take it.

1:22:38.338 --> 1:22:41.255
Captain, we have orders to launch.
There are rules.

1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:43.963
- No TUUM.
- It's D'Orsi. My men!

1:22:46.005 --> 1:22:48.005
Why's he want us to transmit?

1:22:49.463 --> 1:22:51.755
- To detect us.
- D'Orsi wouldn't do that.

1:22:51.922 --> 1:22:54.005
Why did they surface earlier?

1:22:54.463 --> 1:22:55.963
Someone boarded. Who?

1:22:56.088 --> 1:22:57.755
This is Zulu Delta 4.

1:22:58.547 --> 1:22:59.338
Do you copy?

1:23:05.047 --> 1:23:06.297
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1:23:08.672 --> 1:23:11.088
The President's order is irrevocable.

1:23:12.463 --> 1:23:14.047
<i>This is Zulu Delta 4.</i>

1:23:41.505 --> 1:23:42.797
Deactivate TUUM.

1:23:48.755 --> 1:23:50.380
Captain to crew!

1:23:50.922 --> 1:23:52.672
We continue launch procedure.

1:23:55.838 --> 1:23:57.630
200 m from launch depth.

1:24:08.963 --> 1:24:10.963
In any case, it's impossible.

1:24:13.172 --> 1:24:15.338
<i>Formidable</i>, stealth, Grandchamp.

1:24:17.130 --> 1:24:18.380
Three lemons.

1:24:33.213 --> 1:24:35.505
Slightly stronger background noise.

1:24:36.630 --> 1:24:38.380
No engine information.

1:24:39.547 --> 1:24:41.463
No information is information.

1:25:26.547 --> 1:25:27.588
It's him.

1:25:29.547 --> 1:25:30.797
Bearing 2-3-9.

1:25:32.922 --> 1:25:35.797
- <i>Formidable</i> at 2-3-9.
- Maximum distance 1,200 m.

1:25:35.963 --> 1:25:38.630
At that distance, he heard our call.

1:25:39.297 --> 1:25:40.422
He's ready to launch.

1:25:41.338 --> 1:25:44.255
We have no choice but to engage first.

1:25:47.005 --> 1:25:48.213
Hold on, I...

1:25:49.505 --> 1:25:50.547
I've lost him.

1:25:50.713 --> 1:25:51.672
Shit!

1:26:00.005 --> 1:26:01.422
Find him, Chanteraide.

1:26:01.797 --> 1:26:03.672
Time's burning up. Let's go!

1:26:06.422 --> 1:26:07.755
Come on, Chanteraide.

1:26:08.213 --> 1:26:10.130
Death's only beauty is victory.

1:26:10.338 --> 1:26:11.713
We must engage.

1:26:12.713 --> 1:26:14.130
We must engage!

1:26:15.297 --> 1:26:16.630
I'm trying.

1:26:18.922 --> 1:26:20.172
We must engage.

1:26:22.380 --> 1:26:23.797
I can't do it.

1:26:24.922 --> 1:26:26.338
Son, come back here.

1:26:27.797 --> 1:26:29.880
Get the other AWA. Stay focused.

1:26:30.047 --> 1:26:31.672
- They're our brothers.
- No!

1:26:31.797 --> 1:26:33.797
They're sailors with orders to launch.

1:26:33.963 --> 1:26:36.838
Come on, we have them.
They're right there.

1:26:39.338 --> 1:26:40.380
Come on.

1:26:44.005 --> 1:26:45.172
Control,

1:26:45.297 --> 1:26:47.672
prep torpedo tube for underwater vehicle.

1:26:48.172 --> 1:26:50.422
- What for?
- To talk to Grandchamp.

1:26:50.963 --> 1:26:53.213
You knock in Morse, he lets you in?

1:26:53.338 --> 1:26:55.213
Your options, besides firing?

1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:56.880
The pressure's too extreme.

1:26:57.047 --> 1:26:59.088
<i>Titan</i> submariners love pressure.

1:26:59.255 --> 1:27:00.963
Bullshit! This is real life!

1:27:01.130 --> 1:27:03.297
With that logic in Syria, we'd be dead.

1:27:04.130 --> 1:27:05.547
I know what I'm doing.

1:27:07.255 --> 1:27:08.922
Take care of <i>Titan</i>.

1:27:09.505 --> 1:27:11.005
They're my children, too.

1:27:18.755 --> 1:27:19.880
D'Orsi.

1:27:22.588 --> 1:27:23.713
Good luck.

1:27:30.922 --> 1:27:31.838
Track him.

1:27:32.005 --> 1:27:33.338
Stay focused. Come on!

1:27:35.338 --> 1:27:38.963
Delta section, prep vehicle.
No questions asked.

1:28:41.380 --> 1:28:42.338
Last chance.

1:29:12.630 --> 1:29:15.213
Very strange noise, bearing 0-1-5.

1:29:15.380 --> 1:29:17.213
Like a propeller with flippers.

1:29:20.338 --> 1:29:21.588
A combat swimmer.

1:29:21.922 --> 1:29:25.338
Clearly, <i>Titan </i>is hostile
and its manoeuvres are offensive.

1:29:25.463 --> 1:29:26.755
We must engage.

1:29:28.505 --> 1:29:29.505
Captain?

1:29:40.297 --> 1:29:41.380
Torpedoes ready.

1:29:42.463 --> 1:29:44.463
Standing by to engage, captain.

1:29:48.047 --> 1:29:49.088
Engage <i>Titan</i>!

1:30:37.130 --> 1:30:38.422
Fire!

1:30:38.713 --> 1:30:39.922
Delta section!

1:30:41.255 --> 1:30:43.297
Fire in Delta section!

1:30:45.005 --> 1:30:46.713
Masks on!

1:31:09.630 --> 1:31:11.630
Admiral, hull's intact.

1:31:12.088 --> 1:31:14.588
We're watertight
but fire in Delta section.

1:31:14.755 --> 1:31:16.505
Send more men to Delta.

1:31:16.838 --> 1:31:19.172
- We've lost <i>Formidable</i>.
- White noise.

1:31:19.338 --> 1:31:20.672
Need a fixed position!

1:31:23.005 --> 1:31:24.047
Where's D'Orsi?

1:32:07.255 --> 1:32:09.422
<i>Only your ears can save us.</i>

1:32:29.463 --> 1:32:30.797
<i>I trust you.</i>

1:32:37.130 --> 1:32:39.338
Chanteraide! Breathe!

1:33:01.713 --> 1:33:02.880
Inserting splice.

1:33:03.047 --> 1:33:04.005
All clear?

1:33:04.172 --> 1:33:05.172
Standing by.

1:33:05.588 --> 1:33:06.713
Very good.

1:33:18.463 --> 1:33:19.463
Weapons officer?

1:33:19.630 --> 1:33:21.088
When you're ready, sir.

1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:24.505
Control, this is XO.

1:33:24.672 --> 1:33:26.630
Ready to enter President's code.

1:33:26.797 --> 1:33:27.672
Copy that.

1:33:28.380 --> 1:33:29.297
Captain,

1:33:29.422 --> 1:33:30.672
when you're ready.

1:34:02.047 --> 1:34:04.338
<i>Countdown to enter President's code.</i>

1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:13.588
Ten... Nine...

1:34:22.088 --> 1:34:23.797
Enter President's code.

1:34:28.338 --> 1:34:29.505
Code confirmed.

1:34:31.172 --> 1:34:32.547
Code confirmed.

1:35:12.213 --> 1:35:13.047
Three minutes!

1:35:13.213 --> 1:35:14.088
Let's go.

1:35:19.630 --> 1:35:20.588
Silence!

1:35:28.255 --> 1:35:30.588
Missile alignment underway.
Maintain course.

1:35:31.088 --> 1:35:33.547
- I repeat, maintain course.
- Copy.

1:35:33.672 --> 1:35:34.922
Helm is at 2-7-0.

1:35:35.088 --> 1:35:36.297
Open missile door!

1:35:36.630 --> 1:35:37.588
Copy.

1:36:01.630 --> 1:36:02.880
Torpedo.

1:36:06.297 --> 1:36:07.213
Torpedo alert!

1:36:10.130 --> 1:36:12.380
Fired by <i>Titan</i>. Captain, break away.

1:36:13.047 --> 1:36:15.130
Negative. Alignment underway.

1:36:16.213 --> 1:36:18.047
- How long to launch?
- 160 secs!

1:36:18.713 --> 1:36:21.130
- How long to torpedo impact?
- 120 secs.

1:36:21.297 --> 1:36:23.797
- Torpedo is wire-guided.
- We must break away.

1:36:26.130 --> 1:36:28.047
Let's make that wire snap. Torpedo!

1:36:28.463 --> 1:36:29.880
Engage<i> Titan</i>!

1:36:30.297 --> 1:36:32.130
Urgent launch, tube 2!

1:36:32.255 --> 1:36:33.088
Bearing 0-5-9!

1:36:33.213 --> 1:36:34.172
TORPEDO FIRED

1:36:38.505 --> 1:36:41.672
Torpedo alert!
Headed straight for us, 900 m!

1:36:45.797 --> 1:36:46.838
Quiet.

1:36:47.130 --> 1:36:48.255
Quiet!

1:36:48.463 --> 1:36:49.380
We expected it.

1:36:49.755 --> 1:36:52.255
- We must break away.
- It's what he wants.

1:36:52.380 --> 1:36:54.005
To snap the wire. I stay put.

1:36:55.088 --> 1:36:56.380
Maintain course.

1:36:57.213 --> 1:36:58.172
Go on, back off!

1:36:58.297 --> 1:37:00.047
Snap your fucking wire!

1:37:00.172 --> 1:37:02.422
Captain, <i>Titan</i> is not breaking away.

1:37:02.963 --> 1:37:04.213
Torpedo, 700 m.

1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:06.088
- 700 m!
- Accelerating on audio.

1:37:07.047 --> 1:37:08.922
Veer right. Dive!

1:37:10.088 --> 1:37:10.963
Chops!

1:37:11.422 --> 1:37:12.838
Veer right! Dive!

1:37:13.672 --> 1:37:15.005
Chops, what the hell!

1:37:16.505 --> 1:37:18.088
Break away. We're gonna die!

1:37:18.213 --> 1:37:19.505
Don't let me down.

1:37:21.547 --> 1:37:22.463
Cut it out!

1:37:25.047 --> 1:37:26.963
We gotta break away!

1:37:28.130 --> 1:37:30.088
- We're gonna die!
- Stay focused.

1:37:32.463 --> 1:37:34.172
Focus on your screens!

1:37:41.755 --> 1:37:43.422
Captain, we're gonna catch it.

1:37:44.338 --> 1:37:45.213
Masks on!

1:37:49.463 --> 1:37:50.672
<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>

1:37:51.505 --> 1:37:52.297
Masks on!

1:37:52.588 --> 1:37:55.297
<i>Your will be done</i>
<i>On Earth as it is in Heaven</i>

1:37:55.755 --> 1:37:56.713
Men!

1:37:58.088 --> 1:37:59.672
It was an honour to sail with you.

1:38:01.505 --> 1:38:02.880
We'll see this through!

1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:06.005
I'll take guidance on manual.

1:38:06.505 --> 1:38:08.213
Bring up torpedo telemetry.

1:38:08.755 --> 1:38:10.713
Torpedo headed straight for target.

1:38:10.838 --> 1:38:12.338
Time to missile launch?

1:38:12.505 --> 1:38:13.422
40 seconds.

1:38:14.088 --> 1:38:15.547
Buy ten more.

1:38:16.088 --> 1:38:16.963
Deploy decoy!

1:38:24.130 --> 1:38:24.838
FORMIDABLE

1:38:24.963 --> 1:38:26.338
Solution uncertain. Target moving.

1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:28.838
- No, that's a decoy.
- Sure, sir?

1:38:28.963 --> 1:38:31.088
- Machine says no decoy.
- Come left.

1:38:31.213 --> 1:38:34.255
- I know. <i>Formidable</i>'s my baby.
- Coming left.

1:38:37.588 --> 1:38:39.963
Captain, torpedo headed straight for us.

1:38:40.130 --> 1:38:42.338
Cut engines and sonar. We play dead.

1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:49.255
- It's gone!
- Watch. It'll reappear there.

1:38:50.922 --> 1:38:52.088
Hold on.

1:38:53.172 --> 1:38:53.880
Missile!

1:38:54.005 --> 1:38:55.630
Launch authorised in 20 secs!

1:38:55.755 --> 1:38:57.213
Torpedo impact, 15 secs.

1:38:58.422 --> 1:38:59.422
It's over, sir.

1:39:02.380 --> 1:39:03.213
FORMIDABLE

1:39:03.338 --> 1:39:06.505
- Adopted!
- On target, solution positive.

1:39:07.047 --> 1:39:08.255
Target reached, 10 secs!

1:39:10.463 --> 1:39:12.797
Blow air tanks. Create double target!

1:39:17.047 --> 1:39:18.755
Captain, launch authorised!

1:40:19.755 --> 1:40:21.047
Survivors?

1:40:21.963 --> 1:40:23.005
Anyone?

1:40:24.463 --> 1:40:25.505
Anyone answer me?

1:40:37.088 --> 1:40:38.005
Socks!

1:40:38.547 --> 1:40:39.797
C'mon, Socks!

Control, do you copy?

1:41:13.547 --> 1:41:15.130
<i>Control, answer me!</i>

Negative, Chops.

1:41:22.297 --> 1:41:24.005
First, we launch the missile.

1:41:26.630 --> 1:41:28.422
No air in circuit!

1:41:28.588 --> 1:41:29.672
Masks off!

1:41:29.838 --> 1:41:30.963
Monoxide.

1:41:31.797 --> 1:41:33.172
Air's contaminated, sir!

1:41:33.338 --> 1:41:34.755
Evacuate control room.

1:41:34.922 --> 1:41:36.172
Evacuate!

1:41:37.630 --> 1:41:38.755
Come on, captain.

1:41:51.505 --> 1:41:53.422
Stay with me. We're going up.

<i>Captain, Chanteraide here.</i>

<i>If you hear me...</i>

1:42:26.838 --> 1:42:28.463
<i>You always trusted me.</i>

1:42:29.172 --> 1:42:30.547
<i>Trust me one last time.</i>

1:42:31.505 --> 1:42:33.838
I beg you, do not launch a missile.

1:42:34.713 --> 1:42:36.797
<i>It would be a grievous error.</i>

1:42:43.713 --> 1:42:45.922
<i>Most likely, these are my last words.</i>

1:42:49.213 --> 1:42:50.838
<i>I hear the wolf's call.</i>

1:42:55.047 --> 1:42:56.463
Farewell, captain.

1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:28.838
Take it.

1:44:30.505 --> 1:44:33.338
- You, admiral.
- No, we'll get you out of here.

1:44:36.755 --> 1:44:38.755
Socks, put it on. Now!

1:44:40.130 --> 1:44:43.088
Your ears will blow.
Say goodbye to your eardrums.

1:44:52.255 --> 1:44:53.547
In there!

1:45:01.797 --> 1:45:02.755
Let's go!
