00:01.430 --> 00:05.298
Previously on The Good Wife...
Neil Gross. I'm CEO of Chumhum.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.264
ALICIA: Chumhum is a worldwide
company, like Yahoo,

00:07.300 --> 00:09.165
Google, Facebook;
they do business

00:09.210 --> 00:10.734
in Canada, Mexico, China.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.328
Peter Florrick has offered me

00:12.380 --> 00:15.269
the vacated
Illinois Supreme Court seat

00:15.310 --> 00:16.675
if he wins the
governorshlp.

00:16.710 --> 00:17.802
I'm in.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.477
With Agos/Florrick?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.646
Florrick/Agos.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.682
ALICIA: Look, we can't
keep skulking around.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.449
We have to cut the cord
at some pornt.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.117
People want to
wait for bonuses.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.787
Our client, Mr. Marwat,

00:27.820 --> 00:30.152
was a translator
In Afghanistan.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.329
His daughter was
dying from dysentery.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.191
I brought him medicine,
that's all.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.198
I took it to his home
in Badula Qulp.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.065
(line ringing)

00:43.340 --> 00:44.807
(line clicks)

00:44.840 --> 00:46.808
WOMAN (over phone): Hi.
MAN (over phone): Hey, it's me.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.831
I can't believe Jim_.
He was acting so weIrd.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.347
WOMAN: I know. What's all that
Middle Eastern stuff

00:50.380 --> 00:51.278
he was talking about?

00:51.310 --> 00:52.811
MAN 2: _
Have you seen Team America?

00:52.850 --> 00:54.545
(laughs): It's so cool.
I saw it last night.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.844
"Dinka dinka
jihad jihad dinka..."

00:58.120 --> 01:01.180
WOMAN 2: I should probably be
there about ten, 15 minutes.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.187
WOMAN 3:
This sewer kind of smells.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.152
It smells like sarin gas
or something like that.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.157
So I'm thinking...

01:05.190 --> 01:07.090
MAN 4: Yeah, I went to Taliban
down the street.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.859
The cover charge is
just outrageous. I mean...

01:08.900 --> 01:11.266
MAN 5: So, I'm doing
a Chumhum search on Al-Qaeda,

01:11.300 --> 01:14.167
and I started thinking, you
think this puts me on a list...

01:14.200 --> 01:16.703
(men speaking Arabic over phone)

01:18.710 --> 01:20.701
(men continue speaking Arabic)

01:22.350 --> 01:25.604
(phone conversation
in Arabic continues)

01:29.690 --> 01:31.385
(tapping)
Hey,

01:31.420 --> 01:33.411
I need a translation.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.415
(tapping)

01:34.460 --> 01:35.813
I need a translation.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.851
Is it a new call?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.391
No, it's two years old.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.318
Then send it downstairs.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.225
They mentioned one of
the Lockhart/Gardner lawyers.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.669
It's two years old.

01:44.700 --> 01:48.591
Some of us are working
present-day here, okay?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.267
MAN (over phone):
I understand, but I think...

01:50.310 --> 01:51.368
WOMAN: Well, next time.
I'm sure...

01:51.410 --> 01:52.672
WOMAN 2:
I can't believe he said that.

01:52.710 --> 01:55.804
(phone conversations
overlapping)

02:00.950 --> 02:02.417
(line ringing, line clicks)

02:02.450 --> 02:04.247
DIANE (over phone):
What's wrong, David?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.212
DAVID (over phone):
The fourth-years have stopped.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.352
They've stopped
texting each other.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.584
DIANE:
That's good news, isn't it?

02:08.620 --> 02:10.554
DAVID: No. It means
they've been warned.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.626
DIANE: Please. I have an
appomtment With the governor,

02:12.660 --> 02:14.252
and Will is here.
WILL:
You wanted to read

02:14.300 --> 02:15.528
their texts and
there are no texts.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.595
Take good news as good news.

02:16.630 --> 02:19.269
DAVID: The absence of bad news
is not good news.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.406
Okay, David, I have to go.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.408
(line ringing, line clicks)

02:24.440 --> 02:25.930
CARY:
Hey, Alicia, where are you?

02:25.970 --> 02:28.177
ALICIA:
I think in reception.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.302
Wow.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.341
It's big. Where am I going?

02:31.380 --> 02:33.371
I'm coming to you.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.376
$25 a square foot?
I know.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.614
You like it?

02:36.650 --> 02:39.687
I think it's...
a real law firm.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.278
(chuckles):
Yeah.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.652
Let me show you your
office; it's right here.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.421
(laughs)

02:47.460 --> 02:49.325
No, no, it's over here.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.691
Funny.

02:51.730 --> 02:54.290
Oh, hey, everyone, thank Alicia
for the heads-up on the phones.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.864
Bought burners for everybody.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.334
Only use the company phones
for Lockhart/Gardner calls.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.371
(phone ringing)

02:59.410 --> 03:01.378
It's... Will.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.877
Hey.

03:02.910 --> 03:05.401
Shh. Quiet down.
ALICIA: Hey, Will.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.611
Alicia, we have a scheduling
problem here. Where are you?

03:08.650 --> 03:10.618
Lunch.

03:10.650 --> 03:11.981
When can you get back?

03:12.020 --> 03:14.488
Diane's heading out
to a meeting on her judgeship,

03:14.520 --> 03:17.284
and I can't take the Chumhum
meeting; Neil Gross hates me.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.355
I thought Cary
was taking that meeting.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.325
He is. It's just...
they want a partner there, too.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.237
Mr. Gross has expressed
some concern

03:26.270 --> 03:28.295
about Cary being up to the job.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.232
We just want the best.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.373
Sure, I'll be there.

03:35.410 --> 03:36.479
Bye.
What was that?

03:36.510 --> 03:39.513
Will... wants me
in the Chumhum meeting.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.245
Why?

03:41.280 --> 03:43.248
He wants a partner there.

03:43.290 --> 03:47.351
Cary, you're sure Chumhum is
coming with us when we leave?

03:47.390 --> 03:48.687
Yeah. Why?
What did he say?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.426
Nothing. Ijust...

03:50.460 --> 03:52.553
Due diligence.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.750
If Chumhum doesn't
come with us,

03:54.800 --> 03:56.427
we don't have a firm.
I know.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.789
We're fine, Alicia.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.991
I'm in touch with
Neil Gross every day.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.439
Don't worry,
he's coming.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.438
NEIL:
All I want to do is

04:03.470 --> 04:06.303
speak the truth, and I want
to tell our users how little

04:06.340 --> 04:08.433
my company's cooperated
with these NSA subpoenas.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.401
We know, and we're going...

04:09.450 --> 04:11.008
Oh, and the NSA
has asked us

04:11.050 --> 04:12.608
over and over to provide
user information

04:12.650 --> 04:14.049
from our social
networking srtes.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.514
Over and over and over--
I can't tell you

04:16.550 --> 04:17.642
how much we've pushed back.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.987
Actually, yes, I know, Barney,

04:19.020 --> 04:21.454
I can't tell you
how much we've pushed back,

04:21.490 --> 04:24.323
because according to this
gag order, if I do tell you,

04:24.360 --> 04:26.396
I will spend the next
five years in prison.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.295
Could we get a copy
of that, sir?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.695
NEIL: My users think
I have sent every text

04:29.730 --> 04:32.563
and personal e-mail over
to the United States Government.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.932
This gag order prevents me
from denying it,

04:34.970 --> 04:36.437
so what do I do?

04:37.640 --> 04:40.438
Well, first good thing
you did is come to us.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.448
Good. I'm a good boy.
So now what?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.471
ALICIA: Sue them.
NEIL: Sue who?

04:45.510 --> 04:46.875
The National Security Agency.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.343
Sue them for what?
Anything.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.814
The whole point is to look
like they're gagging you,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.418
that you are
the injured party.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.586
Sue them with anything. Great.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.656
That gains more
billable hours for you,

04:57.690 --> 04:59.658
and for me gains nothing.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.622
Sue them for prior restraint.
What does that mean?

05:01.660 --> 05:03.560
Well, the government
can't ban the expression

05:03.600 --> 05:05.864
of an idea prior
to its publication.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.595
That's exactly
what they're doing here--

05:07.640 --> 05:09.403
stopping you from speaking
with this gag order.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.101
You have the same rights
as The New York Times.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.005
CARY: And it'll also
help if we can get

05:13.040 --> 05:14.928
other social networking
sites on board--

05:14.980 --> 05:16.038
Yahoo, Google, Sleuthway.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.172
They're all in town
for TechWeek.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.747
We get them to sign on
to an amicus brief in support

05:19.780 --> 05:20.849
of your claim.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.039
Okay. Good. Do it.

05:25.090 --> 05:28.014
(door opens, closes)

05:28.060 --> 05:29.948
Excellent job.
Thank you.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.787
Hey, Kalinda.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.422
We need help
on this Chumhum case.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.688
We're suing the NSA.

05:34.730 --> 05:36.925
KALINDA:
Okay, what do you need from me?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.722
CARY:
Well, TechWeek is in town...

05:38.770 --> 05:39.794
Hey.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.535
They're suing us.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.128
What?

05:43.170 --> 05:46.378
The law firm, Lockhart/Gardner,
they're suing us.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.502
You and me?

05:47.540 --> 05:49.030
No. The NSA.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.743
Yeah, take that one
to the Systems Admin.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.340
Check out the link
I just sent you.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.011
(bleating)
(bleating)

05:58.050 --> 05:59.517
(bleating)

05:59.560 --> 06:01.118
(bleating continues)

06:03.030 --> 06:04.657
You have $1.3 million.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.090
Now, many advisors
would suggest stocks.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.998
Uh, I tend to advise
interest-bearing bonds.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.039
My second husband always
advised against bonds.

06:17.070 --> 06:19.732
Really? And how long
were you married to him?

06:19.780 --> 06:23.170
(both laugh)

06:23.210 --> 06:26.646
Have you ever been
married, Mr. Liebenbaum?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.045
Uh, I have not.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.083
But, then, I have an excuse:
I'm selfish.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.714
You know what you are,
Mr. Liebenbaum?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.182
Hmm?

06:35.220 --> 06:36.585
You're a carnivore.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.086
You're a jungle cat.

06:38.130 --> 06:41.793
Well, it's a dangerous place
here on the savannah.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.491
The cat survives.

06:43.530 --> 06:44.622
Hmm.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.126
Mom. Hi.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.035
Oh, hi, darling.
How are you?

06:48.070 --> 06:49.958
Good, Mom. I...

06:50.010 --> 06:51.637
What are you doing here?

06:51.670 --> 06:53.433
David and I are
running off together.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.572
Ha-ha.

06:54.610 --> 06:57.101
Ha-ha. We're estate planning.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.799
I was advising bonds.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.909
Ah. Uh, Mom, could you

07:00.950 --> 07:02.019
come by my office...

07:02.050 --> 07:04.189
(phone ringing)
Um, h-hold on.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.211
(whispers):
I'll be right back.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.148
Can you talk?
We have a problem.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.861
Okay, what's the problem?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.219
We don't have the office space.

07:19.270 --> 07:21.830
What do you mean?
We put down earnest money.

07:21.870 --> 07:24.168
I know. And the bank loan
was supposed to come through

07:24.210 --> 07:26.576
to make up the difference,
but the bank wanted to talk

07:26.610 --> 07:28.737
to our current employers.
Will and Diane?

07:28.780 --> 07:30.907
Yeah. And we couldn't
let them talk to them.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.178
Uh, Mom,
I'll be right out.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.871
No, I'll just wait
here. Go ahead.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.547
How did that happen?

07:37.590 --> 07:39.615
I don't know. (sighs)
John made some assumptions.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.925
But now we need $140,000,

07:42.960 --> 07:45.087
or we're out the earnest money.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.121
The $60,00
we already put down?

07:47.160 --> 07:49.765
Yeah. It sucks.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.562
Mom.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.919
It's better by the door.

07:51.970 --> 07:55.098
So now we need to get
the full amount.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.734
Cary... I don't have

07:57.770 --> 07:58.600
$140,000.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.006
CARY:
Do you have any way to get it?

08:01.040 --> 08:02.678
ALICIA:
This is really wrong, Cary.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.099
I put up $10,000 of my own money

08:05.150 --> 08:06.947
for that earnest money.
(knocking)

08:06.980 --> 08:08.242
CARY: I know. I did, too...
Hey.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.145
We're up.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.716
HOPKINS:
It's the Marwat warrant.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.159
FISA court warrant 30-879.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.055
DELLINGER:
Danny Marwat.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.991
He's an Arab-American
translator

08:21.030 --> 08:22.122
who worked for the military

08:22.160 --> 08:24.924
until he was accused of
collaborating with the Taliban.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.198
He hired the law firm

08:26.230 --> 08:28.198
Lockhart/Gardner to defend him.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.935
So that's why we're following
all these lawyers?

08:29.970 --> 08:31.039
HOPKINS:
Just two lawyers:

08:31.070 --> 08:32.571
Alicia Florrick
and Diane Lockhart.

08:32.610 --> 08:35.170
And we've only gone back
two years in the bit bucket.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.303
So we have_ a warrant for this
person of Interest, Marwat,

08:37.350 --> 08:40.012
he hires two lavwers and
we've been listening to
their calls for two years.

08:40.050 --> 08:40.948
I don't see the problem.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.244
Well, these lawyers
also represent Chumhum.

08:43.290 --> 08:46.179
Yeah. This firm's
all over the map.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.654
The problem is,
they're suing us.

08:48.690 --> 08:49.679
These lawyers are?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.085
Yeah. But not for Marwat.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.097
For Chumhum.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.256
(goat bleats over speakers)

08:54.300 --> 08:56.564
(both bleat)

08:57.200 --> 08:59.737
Okay, don't do that again.

08:59.770 --> 09:02.295
So, you want to know whether...

09:02.340 --> 09:04.205
Does our warrant re_strict
listening to a law firm

09:04.240 --> 09:07.630
in active litigation with us
for a non-terroristic action?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.669
_ Sometimes I _can't tell
if you're the stupidest people

09:11.710 --> 09:13.143
in the world or the smartest.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.613
We're the smartest.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.618
Okay, I'll check
with counsel,

09:16.650 --> 09:20.017
and in the meantime, if anyone
refers to this Chumhum suit,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.187
mark it_ down as
a p055ible omit.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.154
Thank you, sir.
We respect you greatly, sir.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.758
Hey, have any of these lavwers
done anything illegal?

09:28.800 --> 09:29.960
Not yet.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.820
I mean, not glaringly yet.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.167
HOPKINS:
Uh, the one lawyer, Florrick,

09:33.200 --> 09:34.861
her husband's about _to be
governor of I||in0is.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.629
What?

09:36.670 --> 09:38.308
Yeah, in about a month.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.604
Alicia's wondering
what to wear to the inaugural.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.377
FROINES: All right,
keep an eye on this.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.243
W_e can_direct Justice
to illegality these days.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.840
Maybe this case can prove
its worth in another way.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.847
Any illegality?

09:49.890 --> 09:50.948
Any illegality.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.151
By the governor?
By anyone.

09:53.190 --> 09:54.782
You're the smartest
people in the world;

09:54.820 --> 09:56.822
don't limit yourselves.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.987
Real hostile energy.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.671
WOMAN: Governor-elect
Florrick's office.

10:13.710 --> 10:16.975
(men laughing)

10:17.010 --> 10:18.944
PETER:
Well, I've wrapped

10:18.980 --> 10:21.039
a three-iron around a tree
many a time, so...

10:21.080 --> 10:24.641
So... do you think you can
get behind this, Chief Justice?

10:24.690 --> 10:25.714
This?

10:25.750 --> 10:26.956
Diane Lockhart's nomination

10:26.990 --> 10:28.810
for the Supreme Court seat.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.249
We'd like to announce tonight.
If that's possible.

10:31.290 --> 10:34.896
How did you like my gift,
Mr. Governor-elect?

10:36.360 --> 10:39.932
"Fiat Justitia
Ruat Caelum."

10:39.970 --> 10:41.835
The engraved gavel.
He loved it.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.269
It was supposed to be

10:43.310 --> 10:45.107
back here today, sir.
We are having it mounted.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.778
Yeah, I'm gonna hang it
on the wall there.

10:46.810 --> 10:47.936
Words to live by.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.143
"Fiat Justitia Ruat Caelum."

10:51.180 --> 10:53.819
"Let justice be done
though the heavens fall."

10:53.850 --> 10:55.738
It's beautiful.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.143
Okay, so, Diane Lockhart?

10:58.190 --> 10:59.919
We'd like you

10:59.960 --> 11:00.915
to attend _
a press conference tonight.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.724
Diane Lockhart is
a perfectly charming woman

11:03.760 --> 11:07.696
with an unobjectionably
appropriate resume,

11:09.330 --> 11:11.764
took every opportunity to defend

11:11.800 --> 11:15.338
her perfectly corrupt
legal partner.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.804
And you'd like her to...?
Explain herself.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.000
Publicly.
I want to know

11:19.040 --> 11:23.943
why her firm still represents
Chicago's top drug dealer.

11:23.980 --> 11:27.040
I want to know how she disagrees
with her disbarred partner.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.411
I want what
you want, Sir.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.883
"Fiat Justitia Ruat..."

11:29.920 --> 11:31.239
Oh, this is such idiotic crap.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.781
You don't want her because
you're a seXIst old fool.

11:33.820 --> 11:34.650
PETER:
Eli!

11:34.690 --> 11:36.317
And you are a rude
backroom huckster.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.248
But that is irrelevant to this.

11:38.290 --> 11:39.427
Chief Justice,

11:39.460 --> 11:42.327
Diane Lockhart is my choice.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.998
It is so good to see you, sir.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.338
(phones ringing)

11:51.370 --> 11:53.076
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.236
How nice to...
Chief Justice...

11:54.280 --> 11:55.975
No, no, no,
don't get up.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.272
What do you
want to do?

11:57.310 --> 11:58.777
Well, we can't lose him.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.448
It'll cost us
too much politically.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.141
I'll tell Diane
we're delaying.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.513
See if you can give him
what he wants, for God's sakes.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.279
Done.
What about this gift?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.356
This gavel?
Have you lost it?
No.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.483
It's probably in the gift room
with the other 900 presents.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.953
I'll make sure it's out here
the next time you see him.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.524
Mounted.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.527
Mm-hmm.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.097
ELI:
It's a gold-plated gavel

12:19.130 --> 12:22.805
given to the governor by the
chief justice, with Latin on it.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.762
Mr. Gold,
remember Damian the intern?

12:24.810 --> 12:25.936
No.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.131
The one
in the Hawaiian shirt?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.542
Oh, yes, the one I fired.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.218
What?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.218
Well, he was in here,
in the gift room,

12:35.250 --> 12:37.013
and I'm just guessing...

12:37.050 --> 12:38.119
He took it?

12:38.150 --> 12:40.459
I just checked
on Clarkswap, and look.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.121
(Eli sighs)

12:45.160 --> 12:47.253
Call him, arrange a meeting.
Don't say who it is.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.997
Just say I'm interested,
and I want to inspect it.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.122
So any word from Google?
No.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.569
Yahoo?
No.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.136
Facebook?
No.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.933
Is this 20 questions, Kalinda?

12:56.970 --> 12:58.403
No.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.102
So... Sleuthway,
Patric Edelstein?

13:01.140 --> 13:02.949
Yes.
Ah.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.971
Edelstein will support
our amicus brief?

13:05.010 --> 13:07.114
No.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.118
Kalinda... what do you have?

13:09.150 --> 13:10.583
Clearly you have something,

13:10.620 --> 13:13.009
because I can see
the file under your arm.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.057
When are you leaving?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.468
To start our own firm?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.058
Soon. Why?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.965
Well, you're putting me
in an awkward position.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.932
That's not my intent.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.234
You intend on taking
Neil Gross and Chumhum

13:31.270 --> 13:32.259
with you as clients, right?

13:34.310 --> 13:35.504
You're improving your position

13:35.540 --> 13:37.246
at the expense
of Lockhart/Gardner.
No.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.272
I'm doing my job as a
lawyer at Lockhart/Gardner.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.289
Kalinda, what
do you have?

13:43.320 --> 13:46.414
Something for Lockhart/Gardner,
not Agos & Associates.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.452
Kalinda, this is a
Lockhart/Gardner case.

13:48.490 --> 13:51.379
Any money derived from it
stays at Lockhart/Gardner,

13:51.430 --> 13:55.298
so whatever you have
helps Lockhart/Gardner.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.258
You have
to change your strategy.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.291
KLUGER:
Yes, yes.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.001
I heard your argument,

14:04.670 --> 14:06.206
Prior restraint
doesn't apply here.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.901
The Second Circuit has

14:07.940 --> 14:09.999
ruled that NSA subpoenas
are legal,

14:10.050 --> 14:13.076
and gag orders are required
for national security.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.179
That ruling wasn't
precedential, Your Honor.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.017
Oh, yes, it was, and
you want to know why?

14:17.050 --> 14:18.085
Because I just said so.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.644
So, if there's no other
business before this...

14:19.690 --> 14:21.009
ALICIA:
Just-- excuse me,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.051
Your Honor,
just one more matter.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.227
What might...?
I know you.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.922
You were just in
here last week.
Yes.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.359
Good to see you again.
Lovely to see you.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.527
What, you're the only
lawyer in town?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.095
(laughs) No. We just had
so much fun last time,

14:33.140 --> 14:34.289
we thought we'd do it again.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.534
Actually, Counselor,

14:35.570 --> 14:38.107
I'm the one who makes
the jokes here, not you.

14:38.140 --> 14:39.562
Apologies, Your Honor.
CARY:
Your Honor,

14:39.610 --> 14:41.498
we'd like to change our suit
to one of selective enforcement.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.679
Your Honor, is the plaintiff
really accusing

14:43.710 --> 14:46.304
the United States of selectively
enforcing its gag order?

14:46.350 --> 14:48.170
We are, and we'd like
to call a witness.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.542
Tingles, Counselor... tingles.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.182
Patric Edelstein.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.256
I'm CEO of the social
networking site Sleuthway.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.952
CARY: And you were just served
a subpoena at TechWeek today?

14:57.990 --> 15:00.254
Yes. Thank you, Neil.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.293
CARY: Uh, what is the size of
Sleuthway, Mr. Edelstein?

15:04.330 --> 15:06.264
The size?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.268
900 million users, and growing.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.359
CARY: And you have
been served with

15:10.410 --> 15:12.298
FISA warrants to grant access
to your users' e-mails

15:12.340 --> 15:13.375
and chatting functions,
isn't that...?

15:13.410 --> 15:15.435
HORTENSE:
Objection, Your Honor.
All discussions of

15:15.480 --> 15:17.243
hypothetical FISA court warrants

15:17.280 --> 15:19.271
are, in fact, classified and
cannot be discussed here.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.675
As Kafkaesque as that sounds,
I will sustain.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.369
CARY:
Have you ever

15:22.420 --> 15:25.309
been served with a gag order
regarding the NSA's requests--

15:25.350 --> 15:29.252
sorry-- hypothetical requests
for access to users' data?

15:29.290 --> 15:31.383
No.
Thank you, sir.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.988
Sorry.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.292
That was just preamble.

15:37.430 --> 15:40.069
(applause over TV)

15:40.100 --> 15:43.365
PATRIC: We can do so much
with technology,

15:43.410 --> 15:47.198
and yet, when I was served
with a warrant, I caved.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.449
We gave the NSA e-mails,
data, phone calls.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.539
Not that many.
Less than a hundred.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.719
But still, we gave it to them.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.308
Rip into him.
Definitely.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.011
So that was you, right?

15:59.050 --> 16:00.187
Yes.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.482
And you were discussing
the extent

16:01.520 --> 16:03.124
of your cooperation
with the NSA?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.219
Do you mind
voicing your answer?

16:05.260 --> 16:07.421
Yes, I was.
And did you receive

16:07.460 --> 16:10.395
a cease and desist letter
from the NSA after that talk?

16:11.330 --> 16:13.298
PATRIC:
No.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.989
Were you warned
of your gag order

16:16.740 --> 16:18.162
No.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.438
Were there NSA recruiters
in the audience

16:19.470 --> 16:21.370
of that talk?
KLUGER:
Okay, okay, okay.

16:21.410 --> 16:22.775
I get it.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.209
Selective enforcement.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.445
And I'm prone to let
this suit go forward,

16:26.480 --> 16:27.708
unless the government
has something up its sleeve.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.012
We request a recess, Your Honor.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.439
Of course you do.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.445
(church bell tolling)

16:32.490 --> 16:34.151
ELI:
What time did you say?

16:34.190 --> 16:36.215
3:00. He's late.

16:36.260 --> 16:39.354
You're not gonna make a
scene, are you, Mr. Gold?

16:39.390 --> 16:41.620
No, I'm gonna get my gavel back

16:41.660 --> 16:44.197
and scare the hell out of
Mr. Hawaiian Shirt.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.595
I'm not gonna...

16:45.630 --> 16:48.030
What? What's wrong?

16:51.470 --> 16:54.576
Oh, Mr. Gold. Hello.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.430
I should have known.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.801
I'm not as fast as I used to be.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.819
Oh. I see.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.386
You're my Clarkswap contact.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.819
You can go now, Deborah.

17:04.850 --> 17:06.408
She seems a
little young

17:06.450 --> 17:07.781
for you, Mr. Gold.

17:07.820 --> 17:09.811
So, Zach took
the gavel home,

17:09.860 --> 17:11.828
you stole it,
and now you're selling it?

17:11.860 --> 17:15.557
No. I am selling it, for $890.

17:15.600 --> 17:19.263
I found it at the flea market
under a stack of old pottery.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.267
It's amazing

17:20.300 --> 17:22.439
what you can find
at the flea market these days.

17:22.470 --> 17:23.698
And it's just a coincidence

17:23.740 --> 17:26.368
you found the gavel belonging
to the father of your boyfriend?

17:26.410 --> 17:27.331
Zach's not my boyfriend.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.677
I'm in college now.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.541
I don't really have time
for high school seniors.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.174
Becca, I work
for the governor now.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.074
I'm his chief of staff.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.519
Congratulations.
You can't steal

17:36.550 --> 17:38.415
from the governor.

17:38.450 --> 17:40.213
You'll be arrested.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.251
Excuse me, Mr. Gold.

17:43.890 --> 17:46.279
That'll be $890.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.753
Oh, no, no, clear Becca.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.860
My gift to you
is you not being arrested.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.436
No, Mr. Gold.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.268
Only one of us is taking
something they haven't paid for.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.165
Excuse me, Officer?

17:58.210 --> 17:59.199
Hello.
Yeah?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.207
Could you help me out?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.435
I-I'm a student here,
and this man is trying

18:02.480 --> 18:04.368
to take one of my father's
antiques, and he won't

18:04.410 --> 18:05.604
pay me for it.
Are you serious?

18:05.650 --> 18:07.277
Officer, uh,
my name is Eli Gold...

18:07.320 --> 18:08.810
Sir, are you a student here?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.809
ELI: Peter and I
have a problem, Alicia.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.748
ALICIA: And it's going
to become my problem, Eli?

18:16.790 --> 18:18.485
ELI:
Uh, I mean, yes.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.249
It's about
Zach's girlfriend, Becca.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.518
Hey, Frick and Frack,
let's go.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.805
And so, our question is,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.398
does this lawsuit
change anything,

18:32.440 --> 18:34.237
or can we continue
our surveillance?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.508
Last time a person of interest

18:35.540 --> 18:37.405
contacted these lavwers
was two years ago?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.474
You mean Danny Marwat? Yes.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.216
And you're a two-hop warrant?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.616
Yup. We can go from
Marwat to his lawyer

18:42.650 --> 18:44.880
to his lawyer's
contacts, that's all.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.482
And this has taken you to
the governor-elect of Illinois?

18:51.360 --> 18:53.453
Well, yeah, but we're not
actively pursuing him.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.398
GARBER:
Doesn't matter.

18:54.430 --> 18:56.352
You're going
into the governor's mansion,

18:56.400 --> 18:58.493
you need a more recent
terrorist connection.

18:58.530 --> 19:02.159
Get it to me in 36 hours, and
we'll take it to the FISA court.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.667
Wait, wait.
That's not why

19:03.710 --> 19:04.836
we brought this to you.

19:04.870 --> 19:06.201
It was about the lawsuit.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.776
I don't have any issue
with the lawsuit.

19:07.810 --> 19:11.507
My issue is taking a two-hop
programmatic warrant into

19:11.550 --> 19:13.643
the governor's mansion.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.874
Thank Edward Snowden.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.774
Everybody's cracking down now.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.481
Why do you guys care?

19:22.520 --> 19:24.624
Move on to one of
your other cases.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.525
I don't_ know.
We were getting interested.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.199
Well, then find a more
recent terrorist connection.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.425
KLUGER:
Okay, here we are.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.495
We're back together.
What do you have, Bobby?

19:33.540 --> 19:36.259
Bobby? Bobby, I intend
to move this suit forward,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.506
unless you guys got something.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.666
We do, Your Honor.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.530
We request a very brief SCIF.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.504
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.869
A what?

19:44.910 --> 19:47.447
SCIF. S-C-I-F.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.971
Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facility.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.510
For the communication of

19:51.550 --> 19:52.312
classified information.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.409
This is really necessary,
Counselor?

19:54.460 --> 19:55.609
It is, Your Honor.

19:55.660 --> 19:56.888
The matter is quite sensitive.
Okay.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.956
I have no choice
but to move this

19:58.990 --> 20:00.855
into the courthouse's SCIF.
(gavelbangs)

20:00.900 --> 20:04.267
Uh, excuse me,
Your Honor.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.426
Plaintiff's counsel
doesn't have

20:05.470 --> 20:06.562
security clearance
for this SCIF.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.739
Excuse me?

20:08.770 --> 20:10.533
The data to be imparted
is highly classified,

20:10.570 --> 20:11.707
and it requires
a security clearance

20:11.740 --> 20:13.378
only available to His Honor.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.809
Your Honor, the AUSA cannot
just determine who can...

20:14.840 --> 20:16.637
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
This is not a FISA court!

20:16.680 --> 20:17.908
KLUGER:
Okay, okay, okay!

20:17.950 --> 20:19.872
I know you're outraged,
but he's right.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.571
You_ don't have
security clearance.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.315
You _have to
wait in court.

20:23.350 --> 20:24.612
(gavelbangs)

20:24.650 --> 20:26.584
ELI: We have a problem
you can help us with.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.554
We need you to do a Chicago
Law interview tomorrow.

20:28.590 --> 20:29.511
An interview?

20:29.560 --> 20:31.881
Really?
On, uh, what subject?

20:31.930 --> 20:33.397
Your work here.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.523
Putting your career
in perspective.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.619
Your excitement at being
considered for the judgeship.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.967
The interviewer
is Mandy Post.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.568
She's good.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.567
She won't sabotage you.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.933
Why do I feel
another shoe is about to drop?

20:43.970 --> 20:46.939
You need to put the past
behind you, Diane.

20:46.970 --> 20:47.777
And how do I do that?

20:47.810 --> 20:49.334
There will be questions
about Will.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.769
His disbarment.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.778
Is this from the chief justice?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.811
Yes.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.416
He won't stand
behind my nomination

21:01.460 --> 21:03.678
unless I declare_
my antipathy to Will?

21:03.730 --> 21:04.981
No.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.055
Not to Will.
To his past behavior.

21:07.090 --> 21:09.297
Oh.

21:13.670 --> 21:17.367
Eli, has... any other nominee

21:17.410 --> 21:20.334
_ ever been asked
to disavow his or her past?

21:20.380 --> 21:21.677
Not that I know of.
And what happens

21:21.710 --> 21:23.974
if I don't?
Peter really needs you

21:24.010 --> 21:25.944
to get the chief justice
on your side.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.016
So I trash Will
or I'm nothominated?
o.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.347
Trash his past.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.314
Oh, of course.

21:32.690 --> 21:35.011
This is insane.
We can't just...
(door opens)

21:36.520 --> 21:39.785
After a discussion in SCIF
with AUSA Hortense,

21:39.830 --> 21:41.525
I rule...

21:41.560 --> 21:43.824
for the government.
(gavelbangs)

21:45.830 --> 21:48.390
Uh, excuse me, Your Honor,
that's crazy.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.032
You haven't even heard
our rebuttal.

21:50.070 --> 21:51.162
What rebuttal?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.064
You weren't even privy
to the government's argument.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.499
That's because we were left
out here.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.349
All right, now listen to me.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.371
If you are arguing,
Mrs. Florrick,

21:59.410 --> 22:02.447
that this is absurd,
I'll agree with you.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.711
But if you are arguing that
this is illegal, unfortunately

22:05.750 --> 22:07.559
you are wrong.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.354
_ Lawsuit based on _
selective enforcement is denied.

22:10.390 --> 22:11.823
Court is adjourned.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.418
Wow.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.052
I'm pissed.
Good.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.590
Use it.

22:16.630 --> 22:17.995
NISA:
I just don't understand.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.429
You said you didn't
want to see anyone.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.358
Nisa, listen to me.
I'm not seeing Becca.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.469
You have to stop calling.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.468
Who's Nisa?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.807
Zach's old girlfriend.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.137
Oh, that cute little
black girl.

22:27.170 --> 22:28.671
I liked her.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.132
You're not supposed
to say "black."

22:30.180 --> 22:32.068
It's "African-American."

22:32.110 --> 22:33.748
But I guess she's Somalian,
so I don't know.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.872
Somalian? Wow.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.444
What are you guys doing?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.744
We bought clothes.
Some very, very pretty clothes.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.088
Mom's not gonna like that.
Oh, sure she is.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.678
She wore this kind of thing
in high school.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.381
Except it had rips in it.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.785
Her father said it looked like
a young man's rape fantasy.

22:46.830 --> 22:48.127
Wouldn't let her wear it.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.127
But she found a way.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.764
How'd she find a way?

22:50.800 --> 22:52.859
She put them in my car and
changed on the way to school.

22:52.900 --> 22:53.969
(Grace and Veronica laugh)

22:54.000 --> 22:56.434
Now, makeup.
You're gonna want to wear

22:56.470 --> 22:58.961
more than you should.
ZACH: What happened
to Christian Grace?

22:59.010 --> 23:01.478
Thought you were religious.
I'm just getting
stuff for school.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.673
Now, now. Jesus has no problem
with Grace looking her best.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.177
That's what
Jesus believed in.
(door opens, closes)

23:06.210 --> 23:07.177
Here.
(phone ringing)

23:07.210 --> 23:09.144
That's Nisa.
I'm letting it ring.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.080
Is anyone answering the phone?

23:11.120 --> 23:12.610
It's Nisa; we're
letting it ring.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.481
Oh, hey, Mom.
How was shopping?

23:14.520 --> 23:15.953
Oh, so much fun.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.082
Grace got three dresses.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.486
You know she wears a uniform;
she doesn't need dresses.

23:19.530 --> 23:20.724
Well, she does for dances.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.194
Am I going to approve of these?
(scoffs)

23:23.230 --> 23:26.495
They're perfectly
appropriate evening attire

23:26.530 --> 23:27.690
for a young lady.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.801
I'm gonna start drinking.
Pour me one, too.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.206
(cell phone ringing)

23:33.240 --> 23:34.901
Hey, Cary.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.168
Any thoughts on Chumhum?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.575
CARY:
Not yet.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.498
But thanks so much.

23:39.550 --> 23:40.949
This is... this is incredible.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.618
Uh, what's incredible?

23:42.650 --> 23:44.618
Your check.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.186
My check?

23:46.220 --> 23:49.451
That I wrote
for the $60,000 contribution?

23:49.490 --> 23:52.459
No, your check for $140,000.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.890
We got the offices,
and you will get

23:54.930 --> 23:58.161
first out with interest
from all the other partners.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.237
Cary, I didn't give you a check.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.534
You did. Yeah, the envelope,
it's from you.

24:03.570 --> 24:06.209
Okay, what-what's the name
on the check?

24:06.240 --> 24:08.834
It's a... a trust.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.848
Iw Road Trust.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.041
Alicia.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.809
Where do you keep
your earrings?

24:18.620 --> 24:21.009
Look, I heard you on the phone,
and I wanted to help.
But, Mom, that's a lot of money.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.756
Oh, I know it is. It's my money,
I want to spend it.

24:23.790 --> 24:27.624
But you're... This is crazy.

24:27.660 --> 24:28.922
Yeah,con§der
italoan.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.564
If you pay me back
in six months,

24:30.600 --> 24:31.999
I won't come after you.
(laughs)

24:32.030 --> 24:34.828
Mom... what's this about?

24:34.870 --> 24:36.690
Why does everything have to be
about something?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.139
Can't someone just be nice?

24:38.170 --> 24:40.638
Okay, if it makes
you feel better,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.773
you have to have
dinner with me.

24:42.810 --> 24:45.608
I've met someone.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.811
VVho?
Michael Barnwright.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.613
Very nice widower.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.743
Retired.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.781
He used to race dogs.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.811
Okay, good. Dinner.

24:58.190 --> 25:00.283
(sighs)

25:00.330 --> 25:02.992
Okay, next adventure.

25:03.030 --> 25:04.190
Mom, I'm not seeing Becca.

25:04.230 --> 25:05.663
Look, it's about
the governor's mansion.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.736
People are going to want
things from you.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.897
And not even big things.

25:09.940 --> 25:12.807
Little things like this gavel.
Why does everybody think
I'm seeing Becca?

25:12.840 --> 25:15.673
_ I haven't seen her
Since she went off to college.

25:15.710 --> 25:18.304
Mom, I told her that I never
wanted to see her again.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.614
Then how did she get Dad's gavel
from the apartment?

25:22.580 --> 25:24.548
What's wrong with this blush?

25:24.590 --> 25:26.546
That is not even blush.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.182
That is grandma blush.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.778
Throw it away.
(laughs)

25:29.820 --> 25:31.651
For your skin, you need
a skin illuminator.

25:31.690 --> 25:33.590
MANDY: Obviously, you are aware
of the rumors

25:33.630 --> 25:35.188
floating around that
you are next in line

25:35.230 --> 25:36.458
for State Supreme Court.

25:36.500 --> 25:40.061
If I had a dollar for every time
I've been rumored for something.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.591
(chuckles) But right now,
I'm just trying to run

25:42.640 --> 25:44.733
my law practice.
Coming out of bankruptcy helped.

25:44.770 --> 25:45.566
Yes, definitely.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.908
It wasn't just
bankruptcy, was it?

25:47.940 --> 25:49.874
I mean, you were also
dealing with the suspension of

25:49.910 --> 25:51.343
a name partner.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.348
Yes, um...

25:53.380 --> 25:56.577
that was a...
tough period for us.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.884
But we got through it.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.979
And you kept Will Gardner's name
on the letterhead.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.181
Was there ever any thought
to taking it off?

26:03.220 --> 26:06.189
I, um... I won't say
the question never came up,

26:06.230 --> 26:09.597
but, um... here we are.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.892
You don't sound thrilled
about it.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.990
Wasn't it almost
disbarment?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.598
Will Gardner's
suspen5ion, I mean.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.859
I'm probably not the best person
to ask about that.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.605
So you don't harbor
any resentment at your partner

26:21.640 --> 26:23.676
for almost single-handedly
destroying your firm?

26:23.710 --> 26:24.677
Our firm.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.678
Correction. Your firm.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.349
Will Gardner single-handedly

26:29.380 --> 26:32.178
won five of this firm's
top awards.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.381
He's the reason
we survwed bankruptcy.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.786
By bending the law?
By using it.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.789
By understanding its limits
and its complications.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.799
And by using everything he can,
within the law,

26:42.830 --> 26:44.127
to win cases.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.762
Really?

26:47.800 --> 26:48.960
Yes.

26:51.370 --> 26:53.838
Oh, wait.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.905
Uh...
(chuckles)

26:55.940 --> 26:57.271
I didn't even
turn this on.

26:57.310 --> 26:58.345
(chuckles)
Silly me.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.371
(recorder beeps)

27:03.450 --> 27:05.645
Shall we start over again?

27:07.860 --> 27:09.179
Okay, now what?

27:09.220 --> 27:11.029
My West Coast lawyers
are suggesting

27:11.060 --> 27:12.925
that it was mistake to try this

27:12.960 --> 27:14.928
in the Midwest
from your offices.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.099
Your West Coast lavwers
are saying this?

27:17.130 --> 27:19.064
Really?
Oh, what do you think, Ben?

27:19.100 --> 27:20.761
This kid thinks
he can take you.

27:20.800 --> 27:21.835
CARY: The Seventh
Circwt is very

27:21.870 --> 27:23.132
sympathetic to business issues.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.262
And it was our mistake

27:24.310 --> 27:25.800
to take a constitutional
argument to them.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.808
ALICIA: When you lose
with the Constitution,

27:27.840 --> 27:28.807
try money.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.401
Okay. And how do we do that?

27:32.450 --> 27:35.010
Interference with prospective
economic gain, Your Honor.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.779
Really?

27:37.820 --> 27:39.788
The government is
interfering with

27:39.820 --> 27:42.254
Mr. Gross's economic gain by...?

27:42.290 --> 27:43.314
Ruining his company's
good name with his customers.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.783
HORTENSE: Your Honor,
the Federal Tort Claims Act...

27:45.830 --> 27:46.785
CARY:
Specifically allows

27:46.830 --> 27:48.821
for suits for damages
against the government.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.088
Not if the government
employees in question

27:50.130 --> 27:51.927
were acting
in a discretionary capacity.

27:51.970 --> 27:52.959
Then produce someone

27:53.000 --> 27:54.865
from the NSA, so
we can ask them

27:54.900 --> 27:56.936
if they were acting
in a discretionary capacity.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.835
Got you there, Bobby.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.771
Your Honor, I have
to request we go back

28:01.810 --> 28:02.504
into the SCIF.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.701
KLUGER:
Mm, no, no, Counselor.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.002
This isn't_ about national
security; this is about money.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.415
What damages
is Chumhum claiming?

28:08.450 --> 28:09.849
$3 billion.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.017
What?
ALICIA:
That's the amount

28:11.050 --> 28:12.745
of stock value
Chumhum has lost

28:12.790 --> 28:15.714
due to its forced association
with the NSA.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.715
Okay.

28:16.760 --> 28:17.920
We'll hear testimony
tomorrow.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.951
(gavelbangs)

28:23.970 --> 28:25.392
(mariachi music playing
over speakers)

28:25.430 --> 28:26.920
ALICIA:
Hey, Mom.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.460
Where's your date?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.058
He isn't coming.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.134
Margarita?

28:32.170 --> 28:34.001
Is everything all right?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.405
No.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.204
He's going back to his wife.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.878
I thought you said
he was a widower.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.478
He was.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.078
I guess she didn't die.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.008
Oh, come on.
Have a margarita.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.210
Let's get drunk.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.753
Maybe your good mood
will rub off on me.

28:49.790 --> 28:51.382
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.
No, no, no.
The worst thing

28:51.430 --> 28:53.455
in the world is to have
someone feel sorry for you.

28:53.490 --> 28:54.923
Ow!

28:54.960 --> 28:56.257
You remember that?

28:56.300 --> 28:58.495
I used to do that to
you when you were five.

28:58.530 --> 29:02.068
I know. And I didn't
understand it then.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.068
(mariachi music continues
over speakers)

29:06.110 --> 29:08.806
You know what I don't
understand about you?

29:08.840 --> 29:11.206
Why I ever divorced
your father?

29:11.250 --> 29:14.378
No. I mean... yeah.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.217
But we'll save that
for another time.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.184
You never liked me as a kid.

29:19.220 --> 29:22.553
I mean, you like
my kids now, but...

29:22.590 --> 29:24.251
but you never really liked me.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.929
I liked you.
No.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.190
We never did anything together.

29:29.230 --> 29:31.460
I think you liked Owen.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.391
And I was a likable kid.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.068
People liked me.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.204
God... if we could just
start over,

29:41.240 --> 29:44.368
do everything just all over
again from the beginning.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.140
Me, too. Ithink
we'd be better at it now.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.083
Don't make me cry.
I'm the one

29:54.120 --> 29:56.554
who should be crying; I'm alone.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.081
Oh, Mom.
Oh...

30:05.170 --> 30:06.990
Okay. Okay.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.089
That's enough.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.001
(sniffles)

30:13.040 --> 30:16.009
HORTENSE:
So you blame the NSA for losing
you 20% of your user base?

30:16.040 --> 30:16.972
NEIL: Yes.
And there was

30:17.010 --> 30:19.205
no other reason for the loss
of so many users?

30:19.250 --> 30:21.172
Not in such sizable amounts.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.575
And on what date did you see
the beginning of this...

30:23.620 --> 30:25.178
"sizable" loss of users?

30:25.220 --> 30:26.847
NEIL: Well, I
would trace it to

30:26.890 --> 30:28.858
the Edward Snowden leak
around June 10.

30:28.890 --> 30:31.256
Thank you, Mr. Gross.
No further questions.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.621
I'd like to call Simon Fishbein.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.093
KLUGER:
Simon Fishbein?

30:34.130 --> 30:36.098
Who's that, your podiatrist?

30:36.130 --> 30:37.893
MAN:
I'm Simon Fishbein.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.864
KLUGER: Oh, yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.130
Nice to meet you.
Would you please join us?

30:42.170 --> 30:44.502
HORTENSE:
You were once a user

30:44.540 --> 30:47.600
of Mr. Gross's networking site,
Mr. Fishbein?

30:47.640 --> 30:52.441
I was. It was a good way
of keeping up with my grandkids.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.439
Ten grandkids and three
great-grandkids.

30:56.480 --> 31:01.179
Each generation is having
fewer and fewer kids.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.380
Have you noticed?
Oh, I have, sir.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.229
HORTENSE:
But you quit Chumhum?

31:04.260 --> 31:06.080
Why is that, Mr. Fishbein?

31:06.130 --> 31:09.054
They allowed Holocaust deniers

31:09.100 --> 31:11.091
to organize
on their site.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.098
And why is that
a problem for you?
Well...

31:18.140 --> 31:19.437
Let the record reflect
that Mr. Fishbein

31:19.470 --> 31:20.903
has just exhibited

31:20.940 --> 31:23.238
a numbered tattoo
from Auschwitz.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.475
Now, you're not the only
camp survivor to be offended

31:25.510 --> 31:27.478
by these Holocaust denier
pages, are you?

31:27.510 --> 31:31.116
No, there's a group of us.
We meet every month at Manny's.

31:31.150 --> 31:35.018
We sent a letter
to this putz here, Gross.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.187
Your parents should
be ashamed of you.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.087
Mr. Fishbein, I'm sorry,
but it's free speech.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.950
We don't take down
objectionable content...

31:42.000 --> 31:43.456
You forced a breast-feeding
support group to take down

31:43.500 --> 31:45.627
a page that had
instructional photographs...

31:45.670 --> 31:46.967
(gavelbangs)

31:47.000 --> 31:48.035
There's no cross-talk.

31:48.070 --> 31:51.562
So, did anything come
of your writing Mr. Gross?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.977
We got a nice letter back--
they spelled my name wrong.

31:55.010 --> 31:58.241
But they didn't
take down the pages.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.046
So we contacted
the Zionist Defense Council,

32:02.080 --> 32:04.139
and they organized a boycott.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.079
And when was
that boycott organized?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.189
June 10.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.223
The same day Mr. Gross
pointed to his losing users.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.024
So we can't really be sure
why users are leaving Chumhum.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.493
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.226
All right, I'll give it to you.
Have fun with it.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.659
Sustained.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.190
Thoughts?

32:22.240 --> 32:23.593
(exhales)

32:27.740 --> 32:28.604
I don't understand.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.607
I didn't do it.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.278
Oh, that part I understand.

32:31.310 --> 32:34.017
What I don't understand is why.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.017
She kept fishing.

32:35.050 --> 32:37.416
It was like she wanted me
to sell Will out.

32:37.450 --> 32:40.578
Yes, people fish
because the fish are biting.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.679
Everyone knows
about Will's troubles.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.529
He's my partner.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.528
We built this firm together.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.551
I mean, that means something.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.521
I hope it means everything,

32:49.560 --> 32:51.391
because that's _what
you've traded it for.

32:51.430 --> 32:54.092
I want to be on the court,
Eli, of course I do,

32:54.140 --> 32:56.392
but I can't betray Will,
not like that.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.102
Hardly matters now.

32:59.140 --> 33:02.405
What's done is done.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.670
Where are you going?

33:04.710 --> 33:08.578
To put together a short list
for the Supreme Court.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.019
North Korea?

33:14.060 --> 33:15.516
Yeah. Apparently,
the US. Government

33:15.560 --> 33:17.619
is investigating Neil Gross
because he had a meeting

33:17.660 --> 33:20.481
with some North Korean
nationals in Seoul last year.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.327
And how do we know this?

33:22.360 --> 33:23.725
One of Robyn's contacts
at the Treasury.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.728
So that's why
he's being singled out

33:25.770 --> 33:27.397
and not Edelstein
or any of the others?

33:27.430 --> 33:29.364
Looks like that.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.334
The man never ceases
to amaze me.

33:31.370 --> 33:33.509
NEIL:
It was a pro-democracy group.

33:33.540 --> 33:37.203
North Korean dissidents,
they wanted us to help them

33:37.240 --> 33:40.448
with, uh, equipment-- cell
phones, encryption software.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.674
Civilians or _
government offICIals?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.348
Some of both. Why?
Because if they were
government officials,

33:44.390 --> 33:46.540
they can get you under the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

33:46.590 --> 33:49.218
You know, it was the good guys
I was talking to,

33:49.260 --> 33:51.148
the ones_ who were
against Kim Jong-un.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.589
Maybe you can
argue that in court.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.121
What is your problem?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.354
Clearly, I don't have one.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.527
NEIL: I was trying to
help the North Koreans

33:58.570 --> 34:00.367
until they backed out.
CARY: Why'd they back out?

34:00.400 --> 34:02.459
NEIL: 'Cause they were
afraid of the NSA,

34:02.500 --> 34:04.206
the same as
everybody else.

34:04.240 --> 34:07.107
Did you give them
this technology for free?

34:07.140 --> 34:09.506
NEIL:
At-at cost.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.701
But they were
supposed to pay you?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.399
Yeah. Why?

34:13.450 --> 34:15.543
WILL: Because if they were
supposed to pay you,

34:15.580 --> 34:17.741
then you have damages.
Sorry.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.418
Wh...

34:19.450 --> 34:22.578
David, can this wait?
I'm in a meeting.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.327
It's about your mother;
you tell me.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.462
I'm concerned about her.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.593
I know, it surprises me, too.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.598
I think she's making
investment decisions

34:35.640 --> 34:37.790
without understanding
the consequences.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.660
What do you mean?

34:39.710 --> 34:41.678
Well, I got off the phone
with her broker just now.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.678
She wrote a check for $140,000,

34:43.710 --> 34:46.679
and he doesn't know
what it's about.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.270
You wouldn't have any
idea what it's about?

34:49.320 --> 34:50.617
No idea.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.515
Because I looked up
the check online.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.609
As her advisor, I have
access to her account.

34:54.660 --> 34:55.718
It was written out

34:55.760 --> 34:59.856
to a Threshold Commercial
Realty here in Chicago.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.199
She's probably making
an investment.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.495
I told her real estate
is a bad idea.

35:05.530 --> 35:08.658
Well... she's coming in
in a minute. We'll talk.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.691
Uh, she's coming in today?

35:10.740 --> 35:12.628
Yes, in a few minutes.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.468
(quietly):
Come on, Mom.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.708
Mom. Where are you?

35:23.750 --> 35:26.844
VERONICA: I'm in the car; coming
to your offices to see David.

35:26.890 --> 35:29.882
Yes. David's gonna ask you about
the check you wrote for me,

35:29.920 --> 35:32.582
and I need you to tell him
that it's an investment.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.222
VERONICA:
It is an investment.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.626
ALICIA: No. But it can't be
an investment for me.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.389
You can't...

35:38.430 --> 35:39.897
Hey, did you find something?

35:39.930 --> 35:41.238
I don't know.

35:42.470 --> 35:43.459
Another terrorist
connection?

35:43.500 --> 35:44.706
I went back
to the metadata.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.799
Forget it. I already did;
there's nothing there.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.603
No, no. This is
from yesterday.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.768
12 calls from a Hamas
sympathizer on the BOLO list.

35:51.810 --> 35:52.845
You're kidding.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.370
To who, Diane Lockhart?

35:54.420 --> 35:56.217
No. Alicia Florrick.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.718
It must be a client.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.547
No. 12 calls to her home.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.353
Left messages on her machine.

36:02.390 --> 36:03.755
A Somali national.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.727
What is that?

36:07.760 --> 36:08.954
Wsum
Taiwanese porn.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.524
Real sick stuff.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.494
Teo Dalmar.

36:12.530 --> 36:15.397
He's a financial supporter
or the Mouharib Mousalim.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.668
What was his call about?

36:16.700 --> 36:18.702
I don't know.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.331
(Nisa sobbing, sniffling)

36:24.380 --> 36:25.972
Sounds like...

36:26.010 --> 36:28.649
crying?

36:30.550 --> 36:33.383
(phone beeps)

36:33.420 --> 36:34.580
Any further witnesses,
Mrs. Florrick?

36:34.620 --> 36:36.485
Actually, Your Honor,

36:36.520 --> 36:38.727
we ask to be heard in a SCIF.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.625
You ask to be heard
in a SCIF?

36:40.660 --> 36:41.957
CARY:
Yes. We have

36:42.000 --> 36:43.695
information of
a delicate matter

36:43.730 --> 36:46.267
that may prejudice our client
with the government.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.722
Objection, Your Honor.
The SCIF exists

36:47.770 --> 36:49.738
to protect
the government, not...

36:49.770 --> 36:52.330
The people, Mr. Hortense?

36:53.710 --> 36:55.530
Well, yes, Your Honor.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.638
Whatever protections

36:56.680 --> 36:58.705
the government enjoys,
people should enjoy as well,

36:58.750 --> 37:00.706
don't you think, Mr. Hortense?

37:00.750 --> 37:02.570
Overruled.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.746
(gavelbangs)

37:07.620 --> 37:09.315
North Korean dissidents?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.486
Freedom fighters,
Your Honor.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.487
Due to_ their
assoqation

37:11.530 --> 37:13.953
with the NSA, Chumhum
has lost the contract

37:13.990 --> 37:15.753
to supply these freedom
fighters with cell phones.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.789
And other technologies.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.798
CARY: That's why
we asked to be heard

37:18.830 --> 37:19.797
in here, Your Honor.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.832
Since Mr. Gross had the temerity

37:21.870 --> 37:24.839
to question the NSA's gag order,
we were afraid the government

37:24.870 --> 37:26.735
may seize on any excuse
to prosecute him.

37:26.770 --> 37:29.273
Even his attempts to spread
democracy in North Korea.

37:29.310 --> 37:30.777
Mm, heaven forfend.

37:30.810 --> 37:33.847
So just how much was this
technology contract worth?

37:33.880 --> 37:35.472
With the freedom fighters?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.738
Yes.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.647
It's $14,000, Your Honor.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.725
$14,000?
Yeah.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.729
That's not quite as
impressive as $3 billion.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.694
We would argue the nature
of this intrusion

37:49.730 --> 37:51.721
into our liberties...
Save it, Mrs. Florrick.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.397
We both know it's not
about our liberties,

37:53.430 --> 37:54.829
and it's not about
the money, either.

37:54.870 --> 37:57.737
It's about the publicity
value of Neil Gross

37:57.770 --> 37:58.737
standing up to the NSA.

37:58.770 --> 38:00.863
Okay, let's get going.
I've made my decision,

38:00.910 --> 38:02.707
and no one_is
gonna like it.

38:06.550 --> 38:09.610
DAVID: $140,000?
I know.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.481
It was a spontaneous investment.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.340
I'm kooky that way.

38:13.390 --> 38:14.459
It's a suite of offices?
Yes.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.355
A very beautiful
suite of offices.

38:16.390 --> 38:18.722
When I saw it,
I just had to have it.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.784
You did?

38:19.830 --> 38:21.081
Yeah. Gorgeous.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.620
It's just that

38:22.660 --> 38:24.628
the commercial real estate
market is so depressed,

38:24.670 --> 38:26.092
it's not the best time.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.439
Well...
you know how I am.

38:28.470 --> 38:30.734
I'm just a real girl
with money.

38:30.770 --> 38:31.737
(both laugh)

38:31.770 --> 38:34.409
Well, I can call the
realtor and get out of it;

38:34.440 --> 38:35.839
we'll put the money toward
a stronger investment...

38:35.880 --> 38:37.677
No, no, no. I'm good.

38:37.710 --> 38:41.077
I mean, once I'm committed,
I'm committed. That's me.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.619
A-Are you sure?
Veronica, it's a lot of money...

38:44.650 --> 38:45.639
David.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.015
Don't do this.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.482
It's my money.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.351
I invested it.

38:52.390 --> 38:53.550
I'm good.

38:53.590 --> 38:54.921
Okay?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.667
Okay.

38:58.700 --> 39:01.089
KLUGER: So, appreciating
the government's legitimate

39:01.130 --> 39:03.394
national security
concerns, I'm gonna find

39:03.440 --> 39:06.932
that the NSA's gag order
should remain in place.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.403
However,

39:08.440 --> 39:09.600
appreciating the legitimate

39:09.640 --> 39:12.473
free enterprise concerns
of Mr. Gross,

39:12.510 --> 39:14.910
I also find that
Chumhum has been damaged

39:14.950 --> 39:18.147
in the amount of... $14,000.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.887
Uh, $14,000?

39:20.920 --> 39:22.683
Mm-hmm.
That's what I said, Bobby.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.722
$14,000. You better call

39:24.760 --> 39:27.422
the General Accounting Office;
it may take them a while

39:27.460 --> 39:29.496
to raise that kind of cash.
One more thing.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.691
At the request
of Chumhum's counsel,

39:31.730 --> 39:34.961
I'm going to place a
gag order on any and all

39:35.000 --> 39:36.490
discussion of damages.
You got it?

39:36.540 --> 39:38.599
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
wh-what's the point of that?

39:38.640 --> 39:40.107
NEIL:
I'm very happy

39:40.140 --> 39:42.608
to report that I've just
come back from federal court,

39:42.640 --> 39:46.508
where my legal team won
a major victory for Chumhum

39:46.550 --> 39:49.576
against these intrusions
on all of our privacy rights

39:49.620 --> 39:51.076
by the NSA!

39:51.120 --> 39:52.644
(crowd cheering)
Yes.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.454
Now, um...

39:55.490 --> 39:59.085
due to, uh... this gag order,

39:59.130 --> 40:02.190
I am not at liberty to discuss
the terms of the judgment,

40:02.230 --> 40:04.562
but suffice to say...

40:04.600 --> 40:06.522
we are pretty happy today.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.559
(crowd cheering)

40:07.600 --> 40:08.692
(laughs)

40:08.740 --> 40:10.093
Thank you!

40:10.140 --> 40:11.095
(phone ringing)

40:11.140 --> 40:12.368
Hello. Alicia Florrick.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.470
NEIL: Alicia, it's Neil Gross.
Just wanted to thank you all.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.808
You did a great job.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Gross.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.649
ALICIA: Would you like me
to get Cary for you?

40:19.680 --> 40:21.045
NEIL:
No, no, no, it's all right.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.479
I'm just heading to the airport.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.578
Um, I want to make sure...

40:23.620 --> 40:25.611
*

40:34.760 --> 40:36.648
Is everything
all right?

40:37.700 --> 40:39.565
Yes.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.465
We have permission
to expand the scope.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.468
The Danny Marwat warrant?

40:44.510 --> 40:46.159
Yes. Though we're
more concerned

40:46.210 --> 40:47.802
about the 12 calls
you discovered

40:47.840 --> 40:50.479
to the Alicia Florrick
v0ice mail.

40:50.510 --> 40:52.239
We didn't catch that.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.147
So we want to expand
the warrant to a three-hop.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.909
Three? Really?

40:56.950 --> 40:59.646
Yes. The proximity
to the governor-elect

40:59.690 --> 41:01.578
is our concern.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.485
We need to keep an eye on that.
Anything you find,

41:03.520 --> 41:06.557
kick it up to Mr. Froines
and to myself.

41:06.590 --> 41:07.557
Good job.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.455
Good catch, both of you.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.091
ELI:
Thank you so much

41:13.130 --> 41:14.529
for coming by again,
Chief Justice.

41:14.570 --> 41:15.537
Certainly, Eli.

41:15.570 --> 41:16.935
What do you need?

41:16.970 --> 41:18.267
Peter would like you
to reconsider.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.733
He would?

41:19.770 --> 41:21.772
Reconsider what?

41:21.810 --> 41:24.904
Your... hesitation to
the Diane Lockhart nomination.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.100
Well, I'm not hesitant, Eli.

41:27.150 --> 41:29.118
I am concerned.

41:29.150 --> 41:30.811
Uh-huh.

41:30.850 --> 41:34.616
Peter would like you to stop...
being concerned.

41:36.090 --> 41:39.981
I'm not sure how that happens
unless Ms. Lockhart is...

41:40.030 --> 41:42.498
Mr. Gove_rn_or-elect.
Virgil.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.639
(sighs)

41:51.740 --> 41:54.061
You're gonna have to reconsider.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.305
Mr. Govern_or-_elect...
No, Virgil.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.070
You're going
to have to reconsider.

42:01.110 --> 42:03.544
Sir, I have strong concerns.

42:03.580 --> 42:06.913
Well, then you'll have to keep
those concerns to yourself.

42:07.950 --> 42:10.919
I know you think
this is about you.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.052
But it's not.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.887
It's about my choice.

42:13.930 --> 42:18.219
And I'm going to make my choice,
whether you like it or not.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.831
(phone ringing)

42:23.870 --> 42:25.701
Diane Lockhart's office.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.332
(chuckles)
Mr. Gold, hello.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.770
Actually, Diane is
in a meeting at the moment.

42:29.810 --> 42:31.607
Would you like
to leave a message?

42:31.650 --> 42:33.003
ELI:
Yes. Tell her she does not

42:33.050 --> 42:34.677
have to give
the interview again.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.870
Everything's fine.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.171
Thank you, Diane.

42:38.220 --> 42:40.211
Great interview.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.222
No problem.
