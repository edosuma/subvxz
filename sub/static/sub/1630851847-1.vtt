00:34.370 --> 00:37.850
It's the trial that's gripped
the nation. Dividing the...

00:37.850 --> 00:41.050
Different sides of the establishment
face a joint trial...

00:41.050 --> 00:44.290
Accusing the media of bias, that
will inevitably result in

00:44.290 --> 00:45.970
an unfair trial.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.450
All rise.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.570
Have you reached a verdict
on which you are all agreed?

01:59.890 --> 02:01.610
Oh, no.

02:13.330 --> 02:17.250
Hi, Hannah, it's me, Mum,
I'm just... I'm starting to get

02:17.250 --> 02:19.810
really worried now, cos
you haven't got back to me,

02:19.810 --> 02:22.690
so if you could give me a call
back, that'd be great, OK?

02:22.690 --> 02:25.250
All right, then, I'll speak
to you soon.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.490
Bye.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.050
The South West Police, what's
your emergency?

02:44.050 --> 02:45.530
It's my daughter.

02:45.530 --> 02:48.810
I went to her house
and she wasn't there.

02:48.810 --> 02:50.450
It was my birthday yesterday,

02:50.450 --> 02:54.090
you see. She, she didn't call,
so I went.

02:55.130 --> 02:57.450
I thought she was probably
just tired after working

02:57.450 --> 03:01.570
at the college ball the other night,
but it's been too long now.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.250
Something's wrong.
I know.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.410
I know something's wrong.

03:14.090 --> 03:18.450
Concern is mounting for the
welfare of student Hannah Ellis, as

03:18.450 --> 03:21.530
groups of her friends have started
to distribute leaflets

03:21.530 --> 03:23.250
in the city centre.

03:23.250 --> 03:27.010
Police are keeping an open mind
and have expressed hope that Hannah

03:27.010 --> 03:29.250
has not come to any harm.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.290
But the sudden disappearance
is out of character,

03:32.290 --> 03:35.490
and they're urging people
at the college ball where Hannah

03:35.490 --> 03:39.850
was working, to come forward
with any photos or video footage.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.410
She's been missing three days.

03:41.410 --> 03:43.650
When are we going to get
the divers in the water?

03:43.650 --> 03:45.690
We're on it.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.170
And who's the CPS sending?
Sweet baby James.

03:49.850 --> 03:52.290
Look, he's fine at this stage.
Just make nice.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.130
We need them one side for this one.

03:54.130 --> 03:57.370
Hoult will be all over it before we
can land the murder charge.

04:08.530 --> 04:12.450
It's a fishing expedition, James.
They've got these threatening
texts...

04:12.450 --> 04:15.890
And no Hannah. ..and her rucksack
and sleeping bag are missing.

04:15.890 --> 04:19.570
Yeah. But why would you pack a bag
and leave your phone?

04:19.570 --> 04:23.370
And also, it was her mother's
birthday on Friday and she didn't
call her.

04:23.370 --> 04:27.890
OK, the arrest is for malicious
communication only.

04:27.890 --> 04:32.090
They can't touch the disappearance.
No.

04:32.090 --> 04:34.610
Tell Butch Cassidy that if this does

04:34.610 --> 04:37.370
progress, we have to tread
carefully,

04:37.370 --> 04:40.210
given the suspect's family
connections.

04:40.210 --> 04:44.370
They mess this up and we'll end
up as a case study for law students.

04:45.810 --> 04:49.170
Right. I'll get down.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.850
There. Let's go.

05:02.170 --> 05:03.410
Talitha Campbell?

05:05.490 --> 05:09.250
Who are you? Talitha Campbell, I'm
Detective Inspector Paula Cassidy,

05:09.250 --> 05:12.530
and I'm arresting you on suspicion
of malicious communication.

05:12.530 --> 05:15.290
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

05:15.290 --> 05:17.530
if you do not mention
when questioned something you later

05:17.530 --> 05:18.890
rely on in court.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.570
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

05:29.450 --> 05:30.970
Come on.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.170
The mother of missing student
Hannah Ellis has this evening made

05:43.170 --> 05:46.690
an emotional appeal
for her daughter's whereabouts.

05:46.690 --> 05:50.210
Hannah would never just disappear
like this, unless something

05:50.210 --> 05:52.250
was terribly wrong.

05:52.250 --> 05:56.290
I beg you, if you know anything,
then call the police.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.490
I just want my daughter back alive.

06:05.210 --> 06:07.250
You're not having this.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.370
You have to give...
It's worth more than you'll earn

06:09.370 --> 06:11.970
in your entire career, baldy.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.690
And it belonged to my grandmother,
so you'll have to come take

06:14.690 --> 06:16.450
it if you want it that much.

06:16.450 --> 06:18.650
Don't worry, Cue Ball, I've got
this.

06:20.410 --> 06:21.930
Take it off.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.570
Yeah, I'm dead - of boredom.

07:44.810 --> 07:47.850
Where's that bloody solicitor?

07:56.090 --> 07:58.130
Have a good evening. Thank you.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.090
Hannah Ellis.

08:05.090 --> 08:09.170
She's a second-year student.
Philosophy and English Literature,

08:09.170 --> 08:11.530
and she returned home after working
at the college ball,

08:11.530 --> 08:13.610
but since then, nada.

08:13.610 --> 08:16.450
Those are the texts sent
between Talitha and Hannah.

08:18.370 --> 08:20.370
First one was sent five days ago.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.410
So, two days before she...

08:23.410 --> 08:26.170
Last one was the day
of the ball itself.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.890
Hiya, Cleo, how's tricks?

08:30.890 --> 08:32.890
Hi, Paula.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.650
Anything I need to know? Mm.

08:35.890 --> 08:41.770
Yes, actually, um, Talitha Campbell
is a rude, entitled little cow.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.090
And you'd just love to throw
her arse in the slammer?

08:44.090 --> 08:47.810
No comment, obviously, but do
tell her she'd be well advised

08:47.810 --> 08:49.730
to watch her manners.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.250
Got it.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.610
Hi. Hello. Hi, Talitha.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.930
Thanks.

09:04.930 --> 09:08.330
I'm Cleo Roberts, the duty
solicitor on call tonight.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.090
I just have to go through a few
boring things with you. Oh, no,

09:11.090 --> 09:14.050
it's been so exciting until now.

09:14.050 --> 09:17.450
So, you know Hannah Ellis?

09:17.450 --> 09:19.930
Hashtag praying for her.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.690
Well, really, all these, erm,
internet fakes.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.890
I hope she's OK, but I'm not
going to pretend I like her.

09:30.890 --> 09:32.090
No.

09:32.090 --> 09:35.610
Well, the police have shown me some
evidence that suggests you're quite

09:35.610 --> 09:37.090
a long way from that.

09:37.090 --> 09:39.010
Yeah, it was just a few
stupid texts.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.770
No big deal.

09:40.770 --> 09:42.610
But her disappearance is, though.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.570
Let's get your account of
things first.

09:48.570 --> 09:51.970
We had a falling out. Over...?
A few things, really.

09:53.650 --> 09:57.290
Well, Hannah went a bit nuts.
Started accusing people of stuff,

09:57.290 --> 10:01.210
saying that I denied abuse on campus
and enabled predators.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.930
What kind of predators?

10:02.930 --> 10:04.890
Oh, just this guy
we're friends with.

10:04.890 --> 10:06.970
He's just a bit OCD. Typical Hannah.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.530
So you were friends once?

10:08.530 --> 10:11.690
I mean, we hung out for a bit,
but she got on my nerves
towards the end.

10:11.690 --> 10:15.490
Also, she was hostile about...

10:17.370 --> 10:18.890
It doesn't matter.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.530
Try me.

10:20.530 --> 10:23.170
I do a bit of webcam and
escort work sometimes.

10:23.170 --> 10:24.530
It's not a big deal.

10:24.530 --> 10:26.050
Lots of students do.

10:26.050 --> 10:28.410
And why did she have an opinion
on that?

10:28.410 --> 10:30.010
Don't ask me.

10:30.010 --> 10:32.010
Well, I think the police might.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.490
Bigotry, I guess. She didn't believe

10:35.490 --> 10:37.690
sex work was just like any
other job.

10:37.690 --> 10:40.290
That's an alternative opinion,
not bigotry.

10:40.290 --> 10:45.330
Yeah, well, it beats relying on my
shithouse family for maintenance.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.730
You don't get on?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.570
They haven't told you who my dad is?

10:52.130 --> 10:53.890
Sir Damian Campbell.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.610
The property developer? Uh-huh.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.930
Bulldozed an orphanage with the kids

10:59.930 --> 11:02.610
still inside, to build
a luxury hotel.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.650
Well, putting your dad
to one side...

11:08.650 --> 11:10.290
Things got a bit noisy.

11:10.290 --> 11:14.770
Ended up with words being exchanged,
and that's the end of it, really.

11:14.770 --> 11:18.890
Yeah, except it's not -
because you're in a police station.

11:20.450 --> 11:23.730
This isn't your ordinary
malicious communication interview

11:23.730 --> 11:26.250
because the recipient of your threat
is now part

11:26.250 --> 11:28.610
of a missing person case.

11:28.610 --> 11:32.530
I would advise you to reply
"no comment" to their questions.

11:32.530 --> 11:35.930
The other problem is your manner.

11:35.930 --> 11:38.050
They will video the interview.

11:38.050 --> 11:41.410
So I still suggest a "no comment"
at this moment in time.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.730
But whichever option you choose,
please don't suddenly change tack.

11:44.730 --> 11:47.370
It is THE worst thing you can do,
really.

11:49.210 --> 11:52.810
Well, she booked in yet?
She's quite the charmer.

11:52.810 --> 11:55.450
I'm sure she'll be used
to getting her own way. Mm.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.250
What did Ginny have to say?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.450
"Tell DI Cassidy to get
a good disclosure..."

11:59.450 --> 12:02.090
I am sure that's not the name
she used for me. Especially given

12:02.090 --> 12:04.490
the mobile phone evidence.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.970
So have you actually got Talitha
at the ball, yet?

12:06.970 --> 12:08.570
Well...

12:09.690 --> 12:12.850
So this is the photo taken
from the survivors of the ball

12:12.850 --> 12:17.690
at 5am. Talitha is not in it,
and it's also taken five hours

12:17.690 --> 12:22.210
after Hannah finished her shift
serving drinks, to walk home.

12:22.210 --> 12:29.330
Then, eyewitnesses and CCTV pick up
Hannah in a few places.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.290
No sign she's being followed,
and we know that she got back

12:32.290 --> 12:34.650
to her room, because of her phone.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.570
The phone is very strange, isn't it?

12:36.570 --> 12:39.210
Mm. It was wedged down between the
bed and the wall.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.530
Like it got pushed there.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.650
So an attacker may not have
realised,

12:42.650 --> 12:46.410
or she just left in a hurry
and couldn't find it.

12:47.690 --> 12:49.210
Any forensics yet?

12:49.210 --> 12:52.530
It's bloody annoying that the mum
tidied before calling us.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.290
She rinsed out all the glasses.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.770
That's understandable, though.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.890
And then, Talitha is picked
up walking home

13:04.890 --> 13:07.010
with a housemate, after Hannah.

13:07.010 --> 13:09.450
They live round the corner
from each other.

13:09.450 --> 13:11.010
Who's the housemate?

13:11.010 --> 13:14.530
Kid called Dhillon Harwood.
His mum's Meera Harwood.

13:14.530 --> 13:16.170
As in THE Meera Harwood? Mm.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.290
Ma'am. OK, her solicitor's
in with the now.

13:24.730 --> 13:26.810
Right, go on, who's the solicitor?

13:26.810 --> 13:29.450
Er, oh, no.
We might have got lucky here.

13:29.450 --> 13:31.730
She doesn't want her family
told. Why not?

13:31.730 --> 13:34.650
No idea, but she was very specific
about it.

13:34.650 --> 13:37.290
So they just got her
a duty solicitor.

13:38.530 --> 13:41.970
Yeah, well, Cleo is one
of the better ones, so she also
got lucky there.

13:41.970 --> 13:45.770
Cleo...? Roberts. Why, do you
know her?

13:45.770 --> 13:49.490
Er, yeah, just a little while back,
you know. Erm...

13:52.770 --> 13:55.330
I've got to go and visit
the mum in the morning.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.930
Don't tell me. They've handed
down a new set

13:57.930 --> 13:59.730
of victim-friendly guidelines.

13:59.730 --> 14:02.690
Yes, because we're supposed to get
involved early now, and manage

14:02.690 --> 14:05.610
the expectations that you lot
have falsely inflated.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.170
Right, I'm going to get off.

14:07.170 --> 14:09.610
Just call me with anything
important. Yeah.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.370
And I'm joined now by the
Shadow Minister for the Environment,

14:18.370 --> 14:19.650
Meera Harwood.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.090
What do you have to say with regard
to the new planning legislation?

14:22.090 --> 14:23.450
Good morning.

14:23.450 --> 14:26.730
Well, I would imagine those rubbing
their hands at the removal

14:26.730 --> 14:31.130
of regulations will be consultants,
property companies, as well
as friends...

14:31.130 --> 14:36.170
Because that's not
self-obsessed. ..or anybody else...

14:36.170 --> 14:38.450
They were saying
a girl from your university

14:38.450 --> 14:40.770
has gone missing. Oh, right. Yeah.

14:40.770 --> 14:43.050
Did you know her?
Who?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.290
Oh, er...

14:46.290 --> 14:49.050
..in my year, we took some
courses together.

14:49.050 --> 14:50.850
Her mum did an appeal.

14:50.850 --> 14:52.370
She was in bits.

14:52.370 --> 14:54.170
So is her daughter, probably.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.010
I'm kidding!

14:57.010 --> 15:00.170
Hannah's probably just gone off
somewhere, Mum, it's the end of
term.

15:00.170 --> 15:01.610
Well, I hope so.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.570
That poor woman.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.770
Erm... I'm going to go to the cottage
for a bit, by the way.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.090
Oh, Dhillon, you've just got home.

15:09.090 --> 15:11.370
Yeah, I know, it's just I've got
that dissertation to write,

15:11.370 --> 15:13.890
and I work better down there,
so...

15:15.250 --> 15:17.690
..about what we can offer
them...

15:19.490 --> 15:20.810
I love you.

15:25.770 --> 15:28.010
This should be ready in about
half an hour.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.090
Cool, thanks.

16:08.210 --> 16:09.970
It's happened again.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.730
Hannah's debit card.

16:14.410 --> 16:15.650
Where is it?

16:15.650 --> 16:18.130
Small train station
just outside Cannock.

16:18.130 --> 16:19.770
Any CCTV this time?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.090
Nothing.

16:21.090 --> 16:24.050
They're choosing locations
without cameras.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.490
Her rucksack missing,
sleeping bag missing.

16:26.490 --> 16:29.930
Cards still being used. I mean,
it could be her. No.

16:29.930 --> 16:31.850
No. Phone still in her room.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.410
No message to her mum.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.970
No CCTV where they're using
the card.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.450
No, that's not Hannah.

16:37.450 --> 16:40.650
That card's either been nicked
or found somewhere.

16:40.650 --> 16:43.930
You want the press saying we don't
take a missing girl seriously?

16:45.890 --> 16:48.570
Right, but we need to liaise
with West Midlands, flag

16:48.570 --> 16:50.730
it urgently with them. Mm.

16:50.730 --> 16:53.810
You know, if they're using the card
there and Talitha's here...

16:53.810 --> 16:56.570
Let's just see what she has to say
about it.

16:58.050 --> 17:02.570
Shall we tell the CPS? Ugh,
they're on a different clock.

17:02.570 --> 17:06.330
Let's just take one thing at a time.
Roger that.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.610
Hiya.

17:19.810 --> 17:22.050
Hi.

17:22.050 --> 17:24.690
There's lasagne.
Oh, great.

17:27.610 --> 17:31.010
Student Hannah Ellis has been
missing for three days.

17:31.010 --> 17:36.010
She was last seen walking home
from her university in the early

17:36.010 --> 17:38.130
hours of June the 18th.

17:38.130 --> 17:41.330
Police have stressed that they're
doing all they can to locate her,

17:41.330 --> 17:44.530
and have encouraged
all those who attended the ball

17:44.530 --> 17:48.530
to come forward with any footage
of photos from that night,

17:48.530 --> 17:51.210
even if it doesn't...

17:51.210 --> 17:54.010
They've arrested somebody.

17:54.010 --> 17:55.530
But they haven't found her yet.

17:55.530 --> 17:58.050
No. I still think there's
a wee chance.

17:58.050 --> 18:00.170
Who is he? Is he related to her?

18:00.170 --> 18:03.490
It's a she. Fellow student. A girl?

18:04.970 --> 18:06.530
Blimey.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.130
So, are you working on it?

18:08.130 --> 18:12.410
Yeah. And it's potentially a big
deal because her family is wealthy.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.250
Oh, well, she'll probably
get off, then -

18:14.250 --> 18:16.450
wouldn't want to want harm
her career prospects.

18:21.290 --> 18:23.530
So, the new cot arrived. Great.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.530
It's flat-packed.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.850
No problem!

18:45.010 --> 18:48.050
How well do you know Hannah,
Talitha? No comment.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.250
What was the cause
of your falling out?

18:52.250 --> 18:53.530
No comment.

18:56.370 --> 18:59.730
You see a text message we marked
number one, can you read it out
to us?

19:06.210 --> 19:08.570
"For the last time, Talitha, I just

19:08.570 --> 19:11.410
"want you and that creep
to leave me alone."

19:11.410 --> 19:12.930
That's Hannah to you.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.010
Who's the creep, Talitha?

19:19.610 --> 19:21.650
Text two. This is you to Hannah.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.810
"Like either of us are interested

19:23.810 --> 19:26.730
"in a frigid little swot like you,
Hannah."

19:26.730 --> 19:28.730
To which she replies,

19:28.730 --> 19:30.890
"Coming from an upper-class whore."

19:30.890 --> 19:33.530
So it's not one-way traffic.

19:33.530 --> 19:36.970
You clearly don't like each other.

19:36.970 --> 19:40.010
But here's where it really
gets nasty.

19:40.010 --> 19:43.130
Text four - you to Hannah.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.650
"Careful, bitch.

19:44.650 --> 19:48.810
"It won't cost me much to have
some crackhead sort you out."

19:54.210 --> 19:57.490
Text five. Hannah to you. "Do not
threaten me again, or I will go

19:57.490 --> 19:58.930
"to the police."

19:58.930 --> 20:02.130
To which you reply,
"Fuck you and fuck the police."

20:08.530 --> 20:10.690
None taken.

20:10.690 --> 20:11.890
Day of the ball,

20:11.890 --> 20:14.490
you sent one last message,
which reads, "Plenty of gin

20:14.490 --> 20:15.770
"in my Negroni, loser."

20:20.050 --> 20:22.410
This is, this is just such
complete bullshit.

20:22.410 --> 20:24.850
I'd just like to remind my client of
her right to... It's fine.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.250
Thanks for the advice, but I'm bored
of saying the same thing

20:27.250 --> 20:28.690
over and over again.

20:28.690 --> 20:31.410
I have nothing to hide.

20:31.410 --> 20:34.210
It. Was. A. Joke.

20:34.210 --> 20:35.850
A joke?

20:35.850 --> 20:37.250
Yeah, OK.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.450
It looks ugly in the cold
light of day,

20:41.450 --> 20:45.610
but yeah, it was a joke
about her having to work that night.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.210
She must have laughed herself silly.

20:49.650 --> 20:53.050
Oh, we can't ask her,
because she's disappeared.

20:54.850 --> 20:59.130
It may be she just wants
to be alone and away from it all.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.890
It does happen, you know?

21:00.890 --> 21:05.050
Yes, we do know that, but it's not
what we think's happened here.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.570
If you're going to question my
client on the disappearance

21:07.570 --> 21:09.570
of Hannah Ellis, you need to...

21:10.890 --> 21:13.330
Let's get back to these threats.
Erm...

21:14.650 --> 21:16.610
..what brought them about?

21:17.890 --> 21:20.250
A disagreement. Over what?

21:22.730 --> 21:24.410
Stuff.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.850
Plus...

21:25.850 --> 21:30.930
Yeah, I admit it, I might have been
a little volatile when I sent them.

21:30.930 --> 21:34.130
Is that what they call
it these days?

21:37.290 --> 21:38.690
Were you jealous of her?

21:38.690 --> 21:40.170
Was I what?

21:41.210 --> 21:44.970
Well, she's smart, pretty, popular.

21:44.970 --> 21:49.170
Oh, I'm quite confident in at least
two of those areas, and I don't give

21:49.170 --> 21:50.770
a shit if people like me.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.490
Well, that's lucky.

21:52.490 --> 21:58.250
So we've got a working-class
kid who's got three A stars

21:58.250 --> 22:01.650
from a comprehensive and all her
tutors are saying she's heading

22:01.650 --> 22:07.370
for a first. Then a posh girl who's
been thrown out of a top private

22:07.370 --> 22:12.250
school before finally getting
pushed through the exams.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.890
You go to the ball.
She works at it.

22:15.890 --> 22:18.650
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Poor little Cinders.

22:18.650 --> 22:21.490
No big old silver spoon
in her mouth. Maybe not.

22:21.490 --> 22:24.970
But I could tell you something
else that she wanted in there...

22:24.970 --> 22:27.850
Whoa, whoa! Oh, I'm so sorry,
so, so sorry.

22:29.530 --> 22:33.130
Erm, could you just
hold it, just hold it?

22:33.130 --> 22:34.530
Yeah?

22:35.890 --> 22:38.930
Thank you. So clumsy.

22:41.490 --> 22:46.290
I am once again suggesting to my
client that she reply, "No comment."

22:46.290 --> 22:49.970
Sure. This change should not
be taken as anything other

22:49.970 --> 22:53.650
than a reflection of the oppressive
and aggressive questioning,

22:53.650 --> 22:55.330
DI Cassidy.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.530
Right.

22:57.530 --> 22:59.890
Erm, I'm going to suspend
the interview here, anyway.

22:59.890 --> 23:02.930
What?! We may just... Some new
evidence has just come to light.

23:02.930 --> 23:05.330
We'll start again in the morning.

23:05.330 --> 23:08.450
Interview suspended, 10:15pm.

23:09.610 --> 23:10.970
Wait...

23:23.050 --> 23:24.210
This is Troy

23:24.210 --> 23:26.530
three days after the ball,
at the same pub where

23:26.530 --> 23:27.970
Talitha was arrested.

23:31.170 --> 23:34.050
And this is Troy outside the ball.

23:34.050 --> 23:38.010
We're sure? We're sure it's him
in both locations?

23:38.010 --> 23:42.210
That's Troy Manners. Student ball
would be a busy night for him.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.930
Fits perfectly with the text.

23:44.930 --> 23:46.690
He could be Talitha's crackhead.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.450
Right, bring him in.

23:50.450 --> 23:51.850
Troy?

23:51.850 --> 23:54.090
That's a kind of Brummie
name, isn't it?

23:54.090 --> 23:55.210
Is it?

23:55.210 --> 23:57.970
Well, he could be the one
behind the card use as well.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.530
Or one of his crew. Right.

24:00.530 --> 24:04.330
Check out his connections
in the West Midlands and keep

24:04.330 --> 24:07.210
digging through the surveillance
footage.

24:12.090 --> 24:13.930
That was a total disaster.

24:13.930 --> 24:17.530
What new evidence? I really have no
idea, but if you can't take my

24:17.530 --> 24:21.370
advice, then I suggest you find
another solicitor. Fine, beat it,

24:21.370 --> 24:24.130
then - this one's probably a bit
above your pay grade, anyway.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.850
And who would you like to represent
you instead?

24:26.850 --> 24:28.570
I'll represent myself.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.730
Oh, you're doing a fantastic
job so far!

24:30.730 --> 24:32.170
Look... No, you look,

24:32.170 --> 24:34.370
Talitha, you're in trouble here.

24:34.370 --> 24:36.770
I know you think you're untouchable,
but you're not.

24:36.770 --> 24:37.970
Nobody is.

24:37.970 --> 24:42.010
You come across as cocky, flippant,
and worst of all, indifferent

24:42.010 --> 24:44.170
to the fate of a missing girl.

24:44.170 --> 24:46.130
The police don't like you.

24:46.130 --> 24:48.050
And should this escalate,

24:48.050 --> 24:49.930
a jury will like you even less.

24:49.930 --> 24:53.090
Now, I know you say you don't care
about the impression you make,

24:53.090 --> 24:55.610
but I think that indifference
will be sorely tested

24:55.610 --> 24:58.850
when you're sitting behind a glass
screen staring at 12 strangers

24:58.850 --> 25:01.490
who won't meet your eye,
because they're just about to send

25:01.490 --> 25:04.410
you to prison for the rest
of your life.

25:04.410 --> 25:06.330
Wow, don't sugar the pill, love.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.810
It's not my job to, love.

25:08.810 --> 25:12.690
My only job here is to ensure
it doesn't get that far.

25:14.530 --> 25:16.010
Try and get some sleep.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.250
I may not want my parents involved,
but you're not the only

25:18.250 --> 25:19.810
lawyer in town.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.770
Let me know when you've decided
on that.

26:00.370 --> 26:01.890
Right now, let's carry on

26:01.890 --> 26:04.770
this chat. We have Gary
on line one.

26:04.770 --> 26:06.330
Gary, how are you?

26:17.330 --> 26:22.010
As in Sir Damian Campbell?
As in Cressida Blithe Custard?

26:22.010 --> 26:23.850
No, I'm not sure. Oh, I've

26:23.850 --> 26:26.370
no idea what her surname
really was, but the mum's,

26:26.370 --> 26:28.610
like, old-school posh. OK.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.930
Yeah, she was one of those '90s
it girls running around doing tons

26:31.930 --> 26:34.850
of coke, getting shagged by
rock stars in Thailand.

26:34.850 --> 26:36.330
It sounds awful.

26:36.330 --> 26:39.570
Yeah, I think she has
a boutique clinic now.

26:39.570 --> 26:42.210
It keeps her busy when she's not
playing tennis.

26:42.210 --> 26:45.170
But I mean, if the daughter wants
them out of it and we can hold

26:45.170 --> 26:49.370
on to this case... It would still
be legal aid, though.
But the publicity, Cleo...

26:49.370 --> 26:52.770
Or, keep the parents involved,
take the money - even better.

26:52.770 --> 26:55.730
She's a massive pain in the arse.
I tell you what.

26:55.730 --> 26:58.610
I've got two guys off a flight
from Addis Ababa, who have filled

26:58.610 --> 27:00.610
up their suitcases with cat.

27:00.610 --> 27:03.650
It's exciting stuff, Cleo.
And you can have it.

27:03.650 --> 27:07.490
You take on the bang to rights
class C supply charge,

27:07.490 --> 27:11.090
I'll deal with the humdrum
millionaire's daughter in possible

27:11.090 --> 27:13.650
murder of fellow student, yeah.

27:53.090 --> 27:57.050
What do you want for breakfast
tomorrow, Talitha?

27:57.050 --> 27:59.650
There's a choice? You can
have a bacon roll

27:59.650 --> 28:01.850
or porridge. Whatever.

28:01.850 --> 28:03.930
I don't really care.

28:03.930 --> 28:06.290
Most people prefer the porridge.

28:06.290 --> 28:10.490
Tea or coffee?
Is it an instant coffee?

28:10.490 --> 28:14.010
No, we bring in a barista to prepare
the perfect flat white.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.890
Ah, you're funny, cop.

28:17.890 --> 28:20.650
Want me to choose for you again?
Tea.

28:36.610 --> 28:39.810
Interviews. That's the bit she has
most, interviews of people money,
sex,

28:39.810 --> 28:43.370
power. Money, money, money,
sex, sex, sex.

28:43.370 --> 28:46.410
Yeah, and how things have changed
and how other things have maybe not

28:46.410 --> 28:48.530
changed quite so much.

28:48.530 --> 28:50.850
Dhillon, stop bloody filming me.

28:50.850 --> 28:53.330
Let's go into film-making.

28:53.330 --> 28:56.170
You'll thank me later, when I show
you Hannah, The Movie.

28:56.170 --> 28:57.850
I'm serious, stop it now.

29:00.610 --> 29:01.970
Put the phone away,

29:01.970 --> 29:04.050
you weirdo. Such an idiot.

29:19.210 --> 29:21.930
Call me back to ask, you
stupid bitch.

30:35.810 --> 30:37.050
You can let them know that...

30:38.330 --> 30:39.490
Campbell.

30:40.610 --> 30:41.890
What?

30:43.330 --> 30:44.610
When?

30:47.850 --> 30:49.210
Who told you?

30:51.290 --> 30:53.410
OK, I'm going straight away.

30:54.690 --> 30:57.890
Got to go to Bristol.
Talitha has been arrested.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.930
How much did she have on her?
It's not drugs.

31:06.730 --> 31:10.250
So, Cleo Roberts is her solicitor.
Cleo Roberts...

31:10.250 --> 31:12.050
As in the Hargreaves case?

31:12.050 --> 31:13.610
Yeah, she was on duty last night.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.650
I'm sure that family will get
rid of her soon enough.

31:15.650 --> 31:17.810
She is very good.

31:17.810 --> 31:20.210
Yeah. I think I'm going to speak
to the mum,

31:20.210 --> 31:21.450
just to explain the arrests.

31:21.450 --> 31:24.170
You know, make sure she knows
that we're actually... On her side.

31:24.170 --> 31:28.330
Yes, I helped write
the new guidelines, James. I know,
I'm just being a swot.

31:28.330 --> 31:30.210
Is it going to be difficult,

31:30.210 --> 31:31.610
you and Cleo?

31:32.690 --> 31:35.010
Look, we don't know what it's going
to be until they find

31:35.010 --> 31:37.650
a body or until Hannah rocks up.

31:38.650 --> 31:39.890
The texts aren't enough,

31:39.890 --> 31:42.650
or anything, without more
evidence. But they're getting

31:42.650 --> 31:45.330
the divers in the water
today, so we'll see.

31:47.890 --> 31:51.570
Police have confirmed
that they have now made two arrests

31:51.570 --> 31:54.370
in the case of missing student
Hannah Ellis.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.370
Their identities have not been
released, but police have stated

31:57.370 --> 32:00.290
that at least one of them
was known to Hannah.

33:01.290 --> 33:03.210
Hi. Hello.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.690
You're the family liaison, right?

33:06.690 --> 33:08.770
Amanda Wilkinson. You must be
James Thornley from...

33:08.770 --> 33:10.490
The CPS. How is she?

33:28.370 --> 33:29.770
I'm sorry about him.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.610
Thank you.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.330
Hannah called him Spam.

33:35.330 --> 33:41.090
I wanted to call him Buster, but she
insisted. That's a funny name.

33:41.090 --> 33:45.530
She could have gone to Oxford,
you know, she got an offer.

33:45.530 --> 33:48.970
But, erm, she wanted to be
near to me.

33:48.970 --> 33:50.570
If she hadn't...

33:50.570 --> 33:52.930
Well, you can't think
like that, love.

33:57.010 --> 33:59.570
Why would anybody threaten Hannah?

33:59.570 --> 34:01.610
That is what they're trying
to find out.

34:01.610 --> 34:04.570
And I should stress that it's very
early days, so I don't want

34:04.570 --> 34:08.330
you to be alarmed or upset if
they release her under
investigation.

34:08.330 --> 34:11.530
"She". That's the bit that
I just...

34:11.530 --> 34:13.810
And that doesn't mean
that she's guilty of anything

34:13.810 --> 34:15.490
more than just some silly texts.

34:15.490 --> 34:18.530
But obviously, they've got
to question her.

34:18.530 --> 34:19.930
It's...

34:20.970 --> 34:24.010
It's the thought of somebody
hurting her, you see?

34:26.650 --> 34:28.290
Deliberately.

34:30.090 --> 34:31.610
I'm sorry.

34:45.130 --> 34:47.770
I was the first person in my
family to go to college.

34:47.770 --> 34:49.130
Were you? Aye.

34:50.490 --> 34:53.130
Hannah was always so good at school.

34:53.130 --> 34:55.690
A stars and everything.

34:55.690 --> 34:59.410
My parents were really supportive,
just like you. Mum was an LPN

34:59.410 --> 35:02.050
up the local hospital.

35:02.050 --> 35:03.530
How about your dad?

35:03.530 --> 35:07.170
What, the great entertainer?
He was a full-time pisshead.

35:10.770 --> 35:13.890
Look, Andrea, I just, I just,
I wanted to introduce myself

35:13.890 --> 35:17.130
and just to begin to explain
our role in the process.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.370
Thank you for coming to see me.

35:25.170 --> 35:26.850
I'm very grateful.

35:39.210 --> 35:42.330
There you go, love. Thank you.
Cheers, darling.

35:48.610 --> 35:49.930
Damian?

35:51.290 --> 35:56.650
No, Dhillon's at home, still in bed,
obviously. Talitha?

35:56.650 --> 35:58.450
You must be joking.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.970
Of course I'll talk to him.

35:59.970 --> 36:01.610
Thanks, Meera, I appreciate it.

36:01.610 --> 36:05.050
I'll see you at the next
Select Committee.

36:05.050 --> 36:07.090
Try and turn up this time.

36:10.130 --> 36:11.530
Talitha and Dhillon are close.

36:11.530 --> 36:13.450
They knew each other from school.

36:13.450 --> 36:14.970
The one she got chucked out of?

36:14.970 --> 36:16.490
No, that was Roedean.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.370
So...

36:21.450 --> 36:23.970
..what do you reckon? Malicious
communication -

36:23.970 --> 36:25.610
it's a bit of an odd one.

36:25.610 --> 36:28.690
It suggests that they're chancing
their arm a bit.

36:28.690 --> 36:31.730
They'll only get an extension
if they're contemplating

36:31.730 --> 36:32.930
a murder charge.

36:35.690 --> 36:37.330
Talitha...

36:38.770 --> 36:40.730
I mean, she's a lot of things,
but...

36:45.330 --> 36:49.410
Anyway, we've activated
Mr Reeves. Great.

36:50.610 --> 36:53.650
Brian can find a leak in
a nuclear sub.

36:53.650 --> 36:57.970
Duty solicitor is a Ms Cleo Roberts.

36:57.970 --> 37:01.410
Well, pat her on the head and
send her straight back to
the high street.

37:01.410 --> 37:03.290
I would certainly hope so.

37:06.690 --> 37:09.850
The commies and the nimbys
are going nuts about me being

37:09.850 --> 37:12.850
invited onto the new
planning taskforce.

37:12.850 --> 37:15.250
They're going to love this.

37:29.370 --> 37:30.610
Thank you.

37:35.890 --> 37:37.690
Cleo.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.370
Hi, James.

37:39.370 --> 37:41.090
You all right?

37:41.090 --> 37:42.450
Yes.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.170
I thought you were in Durham.

37:47.170 --> 37:49.610
Yeah, I was, but then I came back,
you know? Oh.

37:51.210 --> 37:53.050
Cleo, mate!

37:53.050 --> 37:54.610
Troy Manners!

37:54.610 --> 37:57.170
Good to see you're still picking up
the air miles. Yeah.

37:57.170 --> 37:58.370
Frequent flyer.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.410
I hope you have representation.

38:00.410 --> 38:02.250
No comment.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.450
Here, they try and pin this shit
on me, I'm coming for my best girl,
you know that?

38:05.450 --> 38:06.890
Come on, let's keep it moving.

38:06.890 --> 38:09.010
You're on the Talitha Campbell case,
right?

38:09.010 --> 38:11.690
Yes.
How did you...?

38:11.690 --> 38:14.250
DI Cassidy told me.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.530
Wait, Troy is not involved in this?

38:18.490 --> 38:21.290
I can't comment, Cleo.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.170
No.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.450
Of course not.

38:24.450 --> 38:26.250
You never could.

38:47.770 --> 38:51.170
The porridge was shit, by the way.
I'll pass that on to the chef.

38:51.170 --> 38:52.810
Thanks.

38:58.850 --> 39:03.170
Do you know any drug dealers?
Might do, what are you after?

39:03.170 --> 39:04.970
I'm a student,

39:04.970 --> 39:08.530
of course I know drug dealers.
Been in touch with any recently?

39:08.530 --> 39:09.770
Not recently, no.

39:10.810 --> 39:14.250
The police are holding a drug
dealer called Troy Manners.

39:14.250 --> 39:17.210
I don't know anyone of that name.

39:17.210 --> 39:18.770
Sure?

39:18.770 --> 39:20.250
Positive.

39:23.210 --> 39:24.650
Your father's arrived, Talitha.

39:27.090 --> 39:28.850
You fucking told him.

39:28.850 --> 39:30.770
Please don't swear at me. Did you?

39:30.770 --> 39:32.090
No, of course not.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.250
Then, make him go away.

39:37.410 --> 39:38.930
Go on, what are you waiting for?

39:38.930 --> 39:41.770
You're still getting paid,
even if you are on legal aid.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.730
OK, Talitha - last warning.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.530
Watch your mouth.

39:49.450 --> 39:50.730
Sorry.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.090
Sorry.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.490
I'm just really tired now.

39:56.490 --> 39:58.250
Please make him go away.

39:59.770 --> 40:02.730
And if he's brought Seb Harding
with him,

40:02.730 --> 40:04.970
tell him to fuck off times ten.

40:21.690 --> 40:23.850
Thanks.

40:23.850 --> 40:28.490
Sir Damian Campbell? Please,
just Damian. I'm Cleo Roberts,

40:28.490 --> 40:31.930
the duty solicitor assigned
to Talitha's case.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.290
It's so good to meet you and
thank you so much for everything

40:35.290 --> 40:37.250
you've done for Talitha so far.

40:37.250 --> 40:40.210
May I introduce Seb Harding,
who's my lawyer?

40:40.210 --> 40:41.450
Nice to meet you.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.850
Talitha has asked me not to tell you
any of the details of her case.

40:45.850 --> 40:48.930
I've got a pretty good idea
what's going on.

40:48.930 --> 40:51.610
OK, Chloe, with all due respect,
I'm sure you've done

40:51.610 --> 40:53.130
a great job so far...

40:53.130 --> 40:56.770
It's Cleo. And Talitha has also been
very specific that you are not

40:56.770 --> 40:58.810
to be involved in any way.

40:59.770 --> 41:03.730
Please excuse Seb. He can't remember
my name most of the time!

41:05.530 --> 41:10.690
And if you would be so good
as to give me some contact details?

41:10.690 --> 41:12.250
Of course.

41:15.210 --> 41:17.130
She's OK, by the way.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.090
Good to hear.

41:21.610 --> 41:23.410
Better get back in there.

41:27.970 --> 41:31.610
I thought we would... Talitha won't
budge until she's scared enough.

41:33.010 --> 41:35.490
Let's go get a coffee.

41:37.130 --> 41:38.570
Right.

41:45.090 --> 41:47.170
Who's Lady Tease?

41:47.170 --> 41:48.450
No comment.

41:48.450 --> 41:50.770
Is it Talitha Campbell?

41:50.770 --> 41:51.970
No comment.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.970
You ever met Talitha Campbell?

41:53.970 --> 41:55.690
No comment.

41:56.770 --> 41:58.850
Etc, etc.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.010
Is Lady Tease Talitha?

42:00.010 --> 42:02.610
That's how he stores her number
in his phone.

42:02.610 --> 42:04.810
And we've got him at the ball
and calling her.

42:04.810 --> 42:07.970
Then three days later, we've got
him meeting Talitha in the pub,

42:07.970 --> 42:10.890
and receiving an envelope from her.

42:10.890 --> 42:13.250
And there's footage.

42:13.250 --> 42:16.250
We have the pub
under surveillance as part

42:16.250 --> 42:17.810
of a drugs operation.

42:20.210 --> 42:23.530
And you think she's paying him
for the hit?

42:26.250 --> 42:30.930
Look, if Talitha commissioned
an attack on Hannah, he fits

42:30.930 --> 42:32.930
the bill perfectly.

42:32.930 --> 42:37.090
He's a drug dealer, so he can
present an alternative explanation

42:37.090 --> 42:39.810
for all of the things
that you've just mentioned.

42:39.810 --> 42:42.090
Maybe he was just at the ball
dealing drugs to Talitha,

42:42.090 --> 42:44.730
and the envelope's connected
to that. Here we go. Yeah.

42:46.490 --> 42:49.130
So the thing you guys seem to forget
is, I actually want a conviction

42:49.130 --> 42:51.010
as badly as you do.

42:51.010 --> 42:53.410
That's why I don't want to hit
a jury with evidence that comes

42:53.410 --> 42:55.610
with a big old ribbon marked
"reasonable doubt".

42:55.610 --> 42:58.410
Let's just see what Talitha
has got to say about it all.

42:58.410 --> 43:01.210
Troy's DNA anywhere
in Hannah's room,

43:01.210 --> 43:02.610
that'd be the real kicker.

43:02.610 --> 43:07.890
Yeah, we're working on it. Let them
know we're ready for Talitha again.

43:07.890 --> 43:08.930
Yes, boss.

43:14.450 --> 43:18.330
How's Cressy taking it? Took to her
bed with a bottle of Black Cow,

43:18.330 --> 43:19.850
a couple of benzos.

43:19.850 --> 43:21.410
Well, that's Cressy.

43:23.410 --> 43:25.050
Oh, good.

43:25.050 --> 43:27.130
We're booked into Wessex House
for the night.

43:28.490 --> 43:31.090
Ooh, shame I didn't bring
my trunks.

43:35.210 --> 43:39.210
Brian. Hey, Damo. What you got
on Cleo Roberts?

43:39.210 --> 43:42.570
What about her involvement in this
Hargreaves case? Whistle-blower.

43:42.570 --> 43:45.970
She was part of a prosecution team
handling a big gangland case

43:45.970 --> 43:48.530
that involved a lot
of undercover work.

43:48.530 --> 43:51.090
But the digital disclosure
was all over the shop,

43:51.090 --> 43:54.770
and she grassed up her own team.
Case abandoned and judge slapped

43:54.770 --> 43:56.250
everybody about - her name was mud.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.930
Then she switched sides
and teamed up with her old buddy,

43:58.930 --> 44:02.490
Heidi McKinnon, putting the scum
back on the streets, mainly

44:02.490 --> 44:05.370
low-level dealers, assaults.
Minimum-wage stuff.

44:05.370 --> 44:07.530
Bottom line there, brassic.

44:07.530 --> 44:09.090
Keep me updated.

44:12.090 --> 44:14.730
Who do you buy your drugs from,
Talitha?

44:14.730 --> 44:17.610
Obviously, that is a wholly
inappropriate question you do not

44:17.610 --> 44:19.090
need to answer.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.850
I'll rephrase it.

44:20.850 --> 44:22.130
Do you ever buy drugs?

44:22.130 --> 44:25.090
Sorry, I must have missed the part
where my client was cautioned
over...

44:25.090 --> 44:26.810
I don't need to.

44:26.810 --> 44:29.250
Men are always pestering me
to take them, for reasons

44:29.250 --> 44:30.970
that are completely beyond me.

44:32.610 --> 44:35.370
Do you know a man called
Troy Manners?

44:37.090 --> 44:38.290
No.

44:38.290 --> 44:39.970
Well, that's a lie, isn't it?

44:39.970 --> 44:41.010
No.

44:44.850 --> 44:47.010
Take a look at this, would you?

44:50.370 --> 44:51.570
Do you know him?

44:52.970 --> 44:55.010
Of course you do.

44:55.010 --> 44:56.770
That's Troy at the ball.

44:57.730 --> 45:00.130
Trusty mobile in hand.

45:00.130 --> 45:04.890
A mobile on which you exchanged
several texts.

45:07.290 --> 45:11.330
See, we've had this pub
under surveillance for a while.

45:12.690 --> 45:16.330
That's you...and Troy.

45:18.130 --> 45:21.810
Three days after Hannah disappeared.

45:25.570 --> 45:27.410
You hand him an envelope.

45:32.690 --> 45:33.850
No comment.

45:33.850 --> 45:35.330
Flip-flopping again!

45:36.570 --> 45:40.010
I can't believe your solicitor
hasn't warned you about that
as a look.

45:44.210 --> 45:46.410
Interview terminated.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.530
What, what's happening?

45:48.530 --> 45:51.410
Charge me with something or let me
go, it's nearly 24 hours.

45:51.410 --> 45:52.650
I know my rights.

45:52.650 --> 45:55.330
Unless I ask for an extension,
which under the circumstances,

45:55.330 --> 45:57.050
I will certainly get.

45:57.050 --> 45:58.410
What circumstances?

45:58.410 --> 46:01.250
Talitha... Talitha Campbell, you are
now being arrested on suspicion

46:01.250 --> 46:02.970
of murder.

46:02.970 --> 46:05.570
Caution her, please, Andy,
then meet me at the car.

46:07.170 --> 46:10.050
Talitha Campbell, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

46:10.050 --> 46:12.290
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

46:12.290 --> 46:14.210
La la la la la la la la la...

46:14.210 --> 46:16.530
..something you later rely
on court.

46:16.530 --> 46:18.330
Anything you do say may be given
in evidence.

46:18.330 --> 46:19.530
Do you understand?

46:19.530 --> 46:20.930
La la la la la la.

46:20.930 --> 46:23.330
Talitha, take it easy.
OK? Take it easy.

46:23.330 --> 46:25.250
Take it easy. Talitha...

46:25.250 --> 46:28.930
♪ There's no need to worry if you
fall on your faces, no disgrace... ♪

46:28.930 --> 46:32.130
Talitha, stop. Stop it.

46:32.130 --> 46:34.250
La la la la...

46:55.210 --> 46:57.210
Why did you not tell me about Troy?

46:57.210 --> 47:00.850
Because I'm not going to admit
to knowing a drug dealer
in a police station.

47:01.970 --> 47:06.130
And we usually refer to him
as Monies.

47:06.130 --> 47:08.490
What's your problem
with Seb Harding?

47:13.370 --> 47:16.410
He's a bit too close to my mother,
if you know what I mean.

47:18.650 --> 47:20.530
And yet your father...?

47:20.530 --> 47:25.090
Yes, but that's my dad. Not giving
a shit is the ultimate curse, right?

47:30.170 --> 47:31.770
What happens now?

47:34.370 --> 47:37.850
Now, I imagine there'll be a hiatus
while they carry out

47:37.850 --> 47:39.810
the formal identification.

47:39.810 --> 47:42.330
Autopsy, DNA tests, etc.

47:42.330 --> 47:43.890
So they have to release me.

47:43.890 --> 47:47.290
No, they will release you on
the malicious communication

47:47.290 --> 47:50.450
charge, but reset on the murder
charge, which means an additional

47:50.450 --> 47:53.370
36 hours with the permission
of the Super,

47:53.370 --> 47:54.730
which they are sure to get.

47:54.730 --> 47:58.370
Wait, what?
I'm meant to be going to Paris.

47:58.370 --> 48:00.570
No, a friend's got
a gallery opening.

48:00.570 --> 48:03.450
They think you paid somebody
to murder Hannah.

48:03.450 --> 48:05.170
You do understand that, right?

48:05.170 --> 48:06.450
Sure.

48:06.450 --> 48:07.770
But it's bollocks.

48:08.770 --> 48:11.130
Also, innocent until proven guilty.

48:11.130 --> 48:14.650
Yes, that is exactly
what they're trying to do.

48:14.650 --> 48:17.930
Butch up, Cleo. If you do an OK job
here, maybe I'll keep you on

48:17.930 --> 48:19.690
to sue their arses.

48:31.970 --> 48:33.770
Talitha has been arrested.

48:33.770 --> 48:36.210
Her dad called me,
he's very worried.

48:36.210 --> 48:38.330
The only thing he worries about
is share prices.

48:38.330 --> 48:40.530
Why do you think they've arrested
Talitha?

48:40.530 --> 48:41.930
I honestly don't know.

48:41.930 --> 48:45.330
I've been trying to call her,
but she hasn't answered.

48:45.330 --> 48:48.770
So... I guess we know why, now.
It really wouldn't surprise me

48:48.770 --> 48:51.130
if she had something to do
with this. That's stupid.

48:51.130 --> 48:54.130
She might be a bit nuts,
but she's not a murderer.

48:54.130 --> 48:55.930
Do you know anything, Dhillon?

48:55.930 --> 48:58.050
Because if you do, you must
tell the police.

48:58.050 --> 48:59.770
Of course I don't know anything.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.410
What would I know?

49:02.610 --> 49:04.690
I just thought she must
have gone off somewhere.

49:04.690 --> 49:06.090
I can't believe it.

49:07.130 --> 49:10.970
I hope you don't know anything,
because every time Talitha got

49:10.970 --> 49:13.690
into trouble at school,
you became involved in some way.

49:13.690 --> 49:15.730
Well, I'm not.

49:15.730 --> 49:18.850
I don't believe Talitha
has anything to do with it, either.

49:53.850 --> 49:55.650
Thanks.

49:55.650 --> 49:58.290
What kind of text? Urgent-sounding.

49:58.290 --> 50:01.250
"Call me", mainly. He sent
quite a flurry to

50:01.250 --> 50:03.570
Talitha's phone yesterday.
Who is he?

50:03.570 --> 50:05.650
He's the housemate, Dhillon Harwood.

50:05.650 --> 50:07.850
He's gone back to the family
home in London,

50:07.850 --> 50:09.650
now that term's over.

50:09.650 --> 50:11.170
You know who his mum is, right?

50:11.170 --> 50:12.970
Oh, yeah.

50:12.970 --> 50:16.570
Look, don't tell the CPS
anything about this.

50:16.570 --> 50:19.810
He's going to find out. And about
the activity on the bank account

50:19.810 --> 50:21.210
after the disappearance.

50:21.210 --> 50:24.010
Of course we're going to tell him -
just one thing at a time,
all right?

50:24.010 --> 50:27.330
Let's get the identification over
with first, then we'll see
what's what.

50:27.330 --> 50:28.810
Right? Yeah.

51:42.170 --> 51:45.410
Think they'll charge?
Wait for the autopsy, I imagine.

51:47.690 --> 51:51.090
Lady Tease pays Monies to murder
Cinderella - press are going

51:51.090 --> 51:52.690
to like it.

51:52.690 --> 51:55.930
How do you like it? Troy Manners?

51:55.930 --> 51:58.450
Anything's possible, I suppose,
but I don't see it.

51:58.450 --> 52:00.450
Yeah, but what about her?

52:00.450 --> 52:01.690
Thanks so much.

52:01.690 --> 52:02.730
Excuse me, sir.

52:02.730 --> 52:04.890
What's going on with Talitha?
I'm sorry,

52:04.890 --> 52:07.690
I did say. It's OK, Jill.
It's OK.

52:09.210 --> 52:12.530
I can't discuss that with you,
I'm afraid, Mr Campbell.

52:12.530 --> 52:14.610
Lawyer-client confidentiality.

52:21.490 --> 52:25.530
Rising Star! 2015.

52:27.210 --> 52:29.370
And diversity as well.

52:29.370 --> 52:31.810
We all approve of that, don't we?

52:31.810 --> 52:35.330
Erm, no, actually,
not in my experience.

52:38.810 --> 52:42.290
So you were meant for greater things
than a provincial high street once,

52:42.290 --> 52:44.330
weren't you, Cleo?
No offence, Heidi -

52:44.330 --> 52:46.930
I assume you're the McKinnon...?
Yeah. Thought so.

52:48.490 --> 52:52.450
Till you stubbed your toe
on that unfortunate Hargreaves case.

52:54.330 --> 52:57.130
I know a thing or two about
snakes and ladders.

52:57.130 --> 52:58.570
I'm sure you do.

52:58.570 --> 53:00.850
And I can be either.

53:00.850 --> 53:04.330
Really, I don't have a preference.
As long as you get your way.

53:04.330 --> 53:08.530
Precisely. Get my daughter
to talk to me,

53:08.530 --> 53:13.170
let me help her, and then it will be
to everybody's advantage.

53:44.770 --> 53:46.090
All right.

53:46.090 --> 53:47.890
Hey. What's the latest?

53:47.890 --> 53:51.250
The pathology report's in. It looks
like she was gagged with the same

53:51.250 --> 53:53.450
item that was then used
to strangle her.

53:53.450 --> 53:56.250
Gagged? Yeah, she's got green
fibres in her mouth and also

53:56.250 --> 53:59.130
under her fingernails, where
she tried to release the pressure

53:59.130 --> 54:01.690
on her neck.
Fractured hyoid.

54:03.530 --> 54:05.730
Green fibres.

54:05.730 --> 54:08.730
Silk, possibly a scarf
of some sort,

54:08.730 --> 54:11.250
they reckon. A scarf?
Uh-huh.

54:12.650 --> 54:16.130
So she was gagged and strangled
with a green scarf?

54:51.570 --> 54:53.530
There's a bloody screw missing.

54:55.970 --> 54:59.130
Laura, there's a bloody
screw missing!

55:08.050 --> 55:10.890
Ach, Laura, does it even need
all the screws in it, anyway?

55:10.890 --> 55:13.130
Absolutely not,
It's only got a baby in it.

55:17.210 --> 55:19.930
Will you just see who that is?
Don't answer if it's my dad,

55:19.930 --> 55:21.650
I'll be on all night.

55:21.650 --> 55:23.130
DI Cassidy.

55:46.330 --> 55:49.210
They put her in a sleeping bag,
and they placed a kettlebell

55:49.210 --> 55:51.490
in a rucksack to weigh her down.

55:51.490 --> 55:54.850
Then they dumped her in
the wheelie bin, but there's more.

56:06.650 --> 56:08.330
There.

56:10.730 --> 56:12.690
There it is.

56:12.690 --> 56:14.330
What more do you want?

56:15.770 --> 56:17.450
It was her, James.

56:18.410 --> 56:20.530
She's wearing the fucking
murder weapon.
