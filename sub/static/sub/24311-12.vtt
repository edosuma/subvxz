00:09.425 --> 00:12.259
I just had an incredible,
two-hour, private,

00:12.342 --> 00:15.008
not-suspicious-at-all meeting
with President Putin.

00:15.092 --> 00:17.134
We had a vibrant
conversation of me

00:17.217 --> 00:19.092
telling him exactly
what to say and do.

00:19.175 --> 00:21.883
To cover my keister,
all the words I'm about to say

00:21.967 --> 00:23.925
can be swapped out later
for other words.

00:24.008 --> 00:25.608
"Would" could become "wooden."

00:25.634 --> 00:28.203
"Collude" could become "colada."
How am I doing?

00:28.204 --> 00:30.216
Am I getting it right?
I feel like I'm doing really well.

00:30.217 --> 00:32.008
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just shut up.

00:32.092 --> 00:34.717
Let's get to the ceremonial
exchange of hats.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.426
Actually, I think I dreamt that.
Questions?

00:36.509 --> 00:39.470
In your meeting with Putin,
did you confront him about

00:39.471 --> 00:42.342
- the meddling accusations?
- Yes, and he said he didn't do it,

00:42.426 --> 00:43.799
and the only thing stronger

00:43.800 --> 00:46.175
than the best intelligence
apparatus in the world

00:46.259 --> 00:49.027
is a murderous dictator's word.
How was that one?

00:49.062 --> 00:50.253
You're doing great.
I believe in you!

00:50.288 --> 00:52.426
President Putin, do
you have any blackmail material

00:52.509 --> 00:55.676
- on President Trump?
- Um, this guy? Are you kidding me?

00:55.758 --> 00:58.966
He's as clean as a Moscow hotel's
freshly bleached bedsheets.

00:58.967 --> 01:01.217
Mr. President,
does your goodwill toward Putin

01:01.300 --> 01:03.842
explain your brash behavior
toward our NATO allies?

01:03.925 --> 01:05.842
I'm gonna break
a little news here ...

01:05.925 --> 01:08.675
- Putin and I are starting our own NATO.
- What?

01:08.676 --> 01:11.509
It's gonna be called "Cool NATO."
It's gonna be me, Putin,

01:11.510 --> 01:14.151
- Kim Jong-un, Papa John.
- Nope, nope, wrong.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.883
- Our symbol is an octopus with fangs.
- I didn't tell him to do this.

01:17.884 --> 01:19.300
I don't know what he's doing!

01:19.384 --> 01:21.134
President Putin, will
you extradite the indicted

01:21.217 --> 01:23.175
Russian hackers to the United States?

01:23.259 --> 01:27.300
Putin has graciously invited Robert
Mueller's entire team to Russia.

01:27.384 --> 01:29.300
Muller doesn't have to do the dishes,

01:29.384 --> 01:31.467
worry about why his meals
are glowing in the dark.

01:31.551 --> 01:34.633
- He's on vacation.
- Oh, look at him.

01:34.634 --> 01:36.384
♪ He's a big boy at the
big press conference ♪

01:36.467 --> 01:38.134
♪ Doing everything
that the Putin wants ♪

01:38.217 --> 01:40.490
- Mwah! Mwah!
- I got a question ...

01:40.525 --> 01:42.134
where is Hillary Clinton's server?!

01:42.217 --> 01:44.092
That thing's been
off the grid for months!

01:44.175 --> 01:47.342
It's probably sipping cheap rum
on some Mexican beach,

01:47.426 --> 01:49.026
answering to the name "Dusty."

01:49.092 --> 01:52.342
Okay. Here's a gift from
the former World Cup host

01:52.426 --> 01:54.509
to the 2026 World Cup host.

01:54.592 --> 01:57.966
- Pelé was best man at my wedding!
- That is a weird lie.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.134
This is great!
Happy birthday, Melania!

02:00.217 --> 02:01.925
Whoa! Close one!

02:02.008 --> 02:05.842
Nice try. Out of shoes.
Aah! Third shoe?!

02:05.925 --> 02:09.591
Okay. I feel I had it coming on.
Thanks, everyone.

02:09.592 --> 02:11.342
That went so good.

02:11.426 --> 02:13.800
I was worried I would come off
looking weak at this thing.

02:15.717 --> 02:17.717
Ahh! Ha-ha!

02:19.134 --> 02:22.300

Nobody's seen Melania in days.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.641
Anyhoo, what did you
dream about, honey?

03:06.134 --> 03:08.134
Traveling around the world
without Donald,

03:08.217 --> 03:10.300
I've never felt so free.

03:10.384 --> 03:13.676
I just wish the plane wasn't
being flown by his former caddy.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.341
<i>This is
your captain speaking.</i>

03:15.342 --> 03:17.800
<i>Holy crap. We are
definitely flying a plane.</i>

03:17.883 --> 03:19.800
Plus, the only thing
for me back home

03:19.883 --> 03:22.384
is the latest report
of Donald's infidelity.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.217
Actually, I've got the
latest report right here.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.509
Michael Cohen started
an $18-million dollar

03:27.592 --> 03:31.175
"scholarship fund" for a woman
studying elevator handjobs.

03:31.259 --> 03:34.008
You know what? Don't even
tell me about these anymore.

03:34.092 --> 03:38.842
I just want to hear the gentle
hum of an airplane in flight.

03:38.925 --> 03:40.091
<i>Uh, uh, that's normal, right?</i>

03:40.092 --> 03:42.175
Holy mother of God.

03:42.259 --> 03:46.634
- What. Does. It. Say?
- Uh, uh, what does what say?

03:46.717 --> 03:48.216
Your phone.
It dinged.

03:48.217 --> 03:51.175
No. I dinged.
Uh, ding-ding. I'm Sarah.

03:51.259 --> 03:53.551
- Sarah.
- It's probably nothing,

03:53.634 --> 03:56.608
but a Ukrainian stripper
threatening to release a sex tape

03:56.634 --> 04:00.967
was just named the primary beneficiary
of your husband's will.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.533
<i>This is just like
carrying golf clubs.</i>

04:02.634 --> 04:04.467
<i>This is just like
carrying golf clubs.</i>

04:06.092 --> 04:08.426
A $100-million-dollar donation

04:08.509 --> 04:10.758
from a casino mogul is nice,

04:10.842 --> 04:14.800
but it's these grassroot
$40,000-a-plate fundraisers

04:14.883 --> 04:16.551
that will win us the midterms.

04:16.634 --> 04:19.716
Now say hello
to the one that got away,

04:19.800 --> 04:23.841
- Utah Senate candidate Mitt Romney.
- Hello, Mitt!

04:23.842 --> 04:25.883
Great to be here with
my beautiful wife, Ann,

04:25.967 --> 04:27.342
our four handsome sons,

04:27.343 --> 04:30.509
- and our other son, Ben.
- They have an Eric, too!

04:30.592 --> 04:32.192
Tagg, speak for the bunch.

04:32.259 --> 04:34.967
After dinner, we're gonna
pick up all the rubbish.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.425
Look at those dorks!

04:36.426 --> 04:39.008
I bet they've never even
electrocuted their nads

04:39.092 --> 04:40.842
trying to steal a barbershop pole.

04:40.925 --> 04:42.466
And thank you, Donald Trump.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.342
Haven't seen you since
that dinner where you told me

04:44.426 --> 04:46.551
I'd definitely be Secretary of State.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.217
I sold my house at a loss,
showed up on my first day,

04:49.300 --> 04:51.592
and there was Rex Tillerson
in my chair.

04:51.676 --> 04:54.134
Hello!
You forgot I had Stephen Miller

04:54.217 --> 04:56.259
drive your moving truck
into the Potomac.

04:56.342 --> 04:58.842
You don't forget the sight of
ten dogs floating to the surface.

04:58.925 --> 05:00.883
Wow! So great
to be with you all

05:00.967 --> 05:03.217
supporting Mitt's consolation prize.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.467
Melania really wanted to be here,

05:05.551 --> 05:08.217
but she's at Stanford
defending her dissertation.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.467
In her stead,
I brought my beautiful boys.

05:11.551 --> 05:14.551
Don keeps trying to trick me
into saying "twat"!

05:14.634 --> 05:17.008
Dad! Eric won't let me
flick his bee sting!

05:17.043 --> 05:20.217
- A bee died so I could flick this, Eric.
- This is my bee sting, and I don't want you to touch it!

05:20.300 --> 05:23.924
- Why did I hide a beehive in your bedroom if I ...
- Stop it! That isn't ...

05:23.925 --> 05:25.842
Great fundraiser,
though the chocolate fountain

05:25.925 --> 05:29.092
- could've had more horsepower.
- Sir, by the end of the fundraiser,

05:29.175 --> 05:31.758
Eric's nose had bled all over
the CEO of Home Depot.

05:31.842 --> 05:36.008
- And where is Melania?
- She just needed a little space,

05:36.092 --> 05:37.967
so we decided to sleep
in different hemispheres.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.883
You might want to tell her to get out

05:39.967 --> 05:43.134
of that side of the planet, I'm
about to make Earth into a semicircle.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.050
We only bring this up
because Mitt Romney

05:45.134 --> 05:47.509
disinvited you from his
major rally next week,

05:47.592 --> 05:50.259
and other family-values
candidates followed suit.

05:50.342 --> 05:53.384
I love family. That's why
I've turned each Mexican family

05:53.467 --> 05:55.717
into three little families ...
so we have even more.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.426
Meeting over. I won.

05:57.809 --> 06:00.300
Are you sure this will work?

06:00.384 --> 06:03.426
It's a tactic I learned
while storming Tikrit.

06:03.509 --> 06:06.509
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's from "The Parent Trap."

06:06.592 --> 06:08.758
I'm back, Sarah. Now, where's
this pill you mentioned

06:08.842 --> 06:10.800
that makes me think I
spent the last 15 years

06:10.883 --> 06:13.383
- floating in a wave pool?
- Kelly, got your text.

06:13.384 --> 06:15.426
Now, where are those
doughnut crumbs you saw?

06:18.509 --> 06:20.342
The secret's out that
you're heading for divorce,

06:20.426 --> 06:23.160
- and it's bad for business.
- You need to project

06:23.161 --> 06:26.175
the image of a stable,
porn-star-free household.

06:26.259 --> 06:27.859
I don't want to live with him!

06:27.925 --> 06:30.467
Every day is a
Hell-Chernobyl cocktail.

06:30.551 --> 06:34.259
I don't want to live with her!
She won't let Sean Hannity sleep over!

06:34.342 --> 06:37.384
We were gonna use an Ouija
board to talk to Roger Ailes!

06:37.467 --> 06:39.883
That would be fine if not for
the threat of the Democrats

06:39.967 --> 06:42.300
sweeping the midterms,
impeaching you,

06:42.384 --> 06:45.967
and potentially putting you,
Don Jr., and Jared in jail.

06:46.050 --> 06:48.717
Jail's great!
Wait. I'm thinking of St. Barts.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.634
Sir, this is deadly serious.

06:51.717 --> 06:54.676
Mr. President, why are
you licking the table?

06:54.758 --> 06:56.358
You said there'd be
doughnut crumbs,

06:56.426 --> 06:58.955
and I thought they
might be really tiny.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.717
They look so perfect.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.134
That's because they don't
make portraits of presidents

07:08.217 --> 07:10.426
porking a mob boss's cigarette girl.

07:10.509 --> 07:13.800
A Kennedy had an affair?
We gotta tell someone!

07:13.883 --> 07:16.634
Everyone knows.
Even Jackie did.

07:16.717 --> 07:19.175
But they held it together
even when one of the women

07:19.259 --> 07:22.592
did a highly credible media
blitz with Michael Avenatti.

07:30.551 --> 07:35.217
Make America Snap into
a Slim Jim Again! Oh, yeah!

07:36.676 --> 07:39.800
We want to be
just like the Kennedys,

07:39.883 --> 07:42.342
but even more skeptical
of desegregation.

07:42.426 --> 07:44.175
We're not asking for perfection.

07:44.259 --> 07:48.244
We just want you to stand on stage
and not push each other off it.

07:49.842 --> 07:51.467
Here's Mitch McConnell's
phone number.

07:51.551 --> 07:53.551
He'll know what to do.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.800
Let's become
the greatest first couple

07:55.883 --> 07:58.757
- in presidential histor...
- Shut up and dial the number!

08:03.259 --> 08:05.758
To help you find your path

08:05.842 --> 08:09.342
in the Byzantine labyrinth
that is Washington marriages,

08:09.426 --> 08:12.551
I will set you up
on two fun double dates.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.384
Last double date,
he ordered off the kids menu

08:14.467 --> 08:16.300
then took a fake phone call
from Troy Aikman.

08:16.384 --> 08:20.134
Take this. It helps me
through tough times.

08:20.217 --> 08:23.341
- What the hell is that, Mitch?
- Oh, crap. I...

08:23.342 --> 08:26.259
I meant to hand you
the psalm about bravery.

08:26.342 --> 08:28.883
But keep the photo.
I'm not ashamed of my body.

08:30.592 --> 08:33.299
Boys, it's no secret
that my latest wife and I

08:33.384 --> 08:35.342
are going through a bit
of a rough marriage.

08:35.426 --> 08:40.592
Don and I are bad boys! And
that's why you and Malala split up!

08:40.676 --> 08:42.799
He's right. No one
can maintain a relationship

08:42.883 --> 08:45.467
when their sons are constantly
attempting aquarium arson.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.467
In these situations,
kids always blame themselves,

08:48.551 --> 08:51.717
and it's never their fault,
but in this case, it absolutely is.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.383
I need you boys to shape up.

08:53.384 --> 08:55.758
Make this as easy as possible
on Mommy and Daddy.

08:55.842 --> 08:59.259
Eric, I hate to do this, but I
think we gotta return those flares

08:59.342 --> 09:01.467
and reschedule tonight's trip
to the aquarium.

09:01.551 --> 09:04.509
But the blowfish burn brightest
when they're ovulating!

09:04.592 --> 09:06.174
Oh, you don't think I know that?!

09:06.175 --> 09:08.925
I was the one that taught you
when blowfish ovulate, Eric!

09:09.008 --> 09:10.508
We do this for Dad!

09:10.709 --> 09:13.442
Hillary. Bill.
Glad you found the place.

09:13.477 --> 09:14.932
They give you any trouble
at the door?

09:14.967 --> 09:16.384
'Cause I told them to give
you trouble at the door.

09:16.467 --> 09:20.134
It was a little hard to get in
with all the subpoenas piled up.

09:20.217 --> 09:22.134
Yeah... whenever Mueller knocks,

09:22.217 --> 09:24.467
we just pretend we're
a bunch of dogs in here.

09:24.551 --> 09:26.758
 I am the dog!

09:26.842 --> 09:28.800
Let's get this over with
so Hillary can get back

09:28.883 --> 09:31.175
to pretending like
she still lives here.

09:31.259 --> 09:32.967
The key to
a Washington marriage

09:33.050 --> 09:35.342
is blindly ignoring
each other's flaws.

09:35.426 --> 09:38.050
Me, for example,
I look past Hillary's thirst

09:38.134 --> 09:39.675
for the blood
of a virgin mega-donor.

09:39.676 --> 09:43.800
Aww. And I look past his
criminally poor impulse control.

09:43.883 --> 09:47.512
- I should be in jail.
- That seems pretty good. Right, honey?

09:47.547 --> 09:48.757
And what do I get out of it?

09:48.758 --> 09:51.509
You get to suckle at the
teat of power for decades

09:51.592 --> 09:53.883
and someday you, too,
could lose the presidency

09:53.967 --> 09:57.384
to a dangerous and demonstrably
unqualified candidate.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.342
Time to go shotgun
a bottle of Cabernet.

10:00.426 --> 10:04.384
Dad says we're gonna ruin the election
if we don't act like good boys.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.842
So what's your secret, Tagg?
You can tell me.

10:06.925 --> 10:09.092
Romney boys follow
two simple rules ...

10:09.175 --> 10:11.259
finish each day with
a bucket of hot milk

10:11.342 --> 10:13.634
and always do what
Phil Mickelson would do.

10:13.717 --> 10:15.758
Dude, you're gonna have to
translate that into genius

10:15.842 --> 10:19.050
- so I can understand it.
- Here. Let's try some role-play.

10:19.134 --> 10:21.634
I'll be the maître d'
at a bustling bistro.

10:23.008 --> 10:25.676
Sir, the wait time for
a table is 30 minutes.

10:25.758 --> 10:29.758
Give me the fucking table,
or get me your manager!

10:29.842 --> 10:33.676
- Whoa! Time out!
- Hello. What seems to be the problem?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.175
My dad is President, and
you can't get me a table.

10:36.259 --> 10:40.467
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Right this way!

10:40.551 --> 10:42.910
Thank you!
So, how long have you been

10:42.911 --> 10:45.431
- in the food-service industry?
- Since we opened!

10:45.466 --> 10:47.717
My father, Diablo, was a sous-chef.

10:49.384 --> 10:51.509
Time to get marriage advice
from two people who look like

10:51.592 --> 10:54.384
their house is covered in hamster tubes!

10:54.467 --> 10:56.676
We hope you choose
to follow our example

10:56.758 --> 11:00.217
and live like you're the married
dolls in a child's imagination.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.925
I wear Velcro pants,
and, every once in a while,

11:03.008 --> 11:06.676
- a little girl gives me a haircut.
- Don't you get bored with monogamy?

11:06.758 --> 11:08.925
What do you brag about when
you call into Howard Stern?

11:09.008 --> 11:11.717
I brag about how Karen
keeps my dinner warm

11:11.800 --> 11:14.217
the same way a hen
keeps her eggs warm.

11:14.300 --> 11:18.717
So Mike never forgets me,
I paste a big picture of my face

11:18.800 --> 11:22.217
over every page of his
Homeland Security briefings.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.342
Now every time I think of genocide,
I think of my beautiful wife.

11:27.717 --> 11:29.551
If you want to keep
Daddy's marriage together,

11:29.634 --> 11:31.133
you have to be good boys.

11:31.134 --> 11:34.092
I'm already a good boy,
but it didn't happen overnight.

11:34.175 --> 11:37.134
Yeah, it took a lot of
manufacturing of her personality,

11:37.217 --> 11:40.341
to the point where she's unknowable
to herself and her husband.

11:40.342 --> 11:43.342
Right! I find that if you're
wearing the right outfit,

11:43.426 --> 11:45.800
everything falls
into place from there.

11:45.883 --> 11:48.134
Joining me now,
Don Jr. and Eric Trump,

11:48.217 --> 11:49.799
who I assume are here

11:49.800 --> 11:51.400
to sniff out my greatest fears
and exploit them,

11:51.467 --> 11:53.067
which is why I have mace.

11:53.134 --> 11:56.175
Thanks for having us
in your lovely home.

11:56.259 --> 11:58.551
How do you respond to evidence
that your father's campaign

11:58.634 --> 12:00.883
actively colluded with the Russians?

12:00.967 --> 12:04.842
I, for one, am enthralled by
your journalistic acumen.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.842
Our spokesm...
Excuse me.

12:06.925 --> 12:09.217
spokesperson will get
right back to you on that.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.592
I'm sorry. Why isn't Eric
biting down on my forearm?

12:11.676 --> 12:14.634
Why isn't Don Jr.
gas-pedaling my crotch?

12:14.717 --> 12:17.883
Why would we, humble chimney
sweeps dressed as sailors,

12:17.967 --> 12:21.467
disrespect a world-class
news analyst?

12:21.551 --> 12:24.608
Unh! Can you tell us what's going
on with your father and Melania?

12:24.634 --> 12:27.259
Father and his
special friend, Melania,

12:27.342 --> 12:30.217
are happier than a
sunshine sandwich, Anderson,

12:30.300 --> 12:32.883
and it's because we are
being such very good boys.

12:32.967 --> 12:35.509
I don't know what the hell
you two are up to, but... !

12:35.592 --> 12:39.217
- Where did you get those?
- I ate all my green beans.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.652
- That's it.
- Aah!

12:42.842 --> 12:44.883
It's been so long since
we had a nice dinner

12:44.967 --> 12:47.050
to bitch about other people
behind their backs.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.550
The Pences were crazy.

12:48.551 --> 12:50.151
Did you notice that when
Mike left the table,

12:50.217 --> 12:53.174
- Karen went to sleep?
- The Clintons are just as silly.

12:53.175 --> 12:54.842
Bill gave me that
weird Teddy bear

12:54.925 --> 12:57.342
with a blinking red light
to put on my nightstand.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.217
Melania, I know
things have been tough

12:59.300 --> 13:01.175
for the entirety of our relationship,

13:01.259 --> 13:03.467
but remember
what we made together?

13:03.551 --> 13:06.175
Ohh, it's our
prenuptial agreement!

13:06.259 --> 13:08.634
Remember when I said
$13 million dollars

13:08.717 --> 13:11.800
and you said $15 million dollars...

13:11.883 --> 13:15.134
<i>And then we both said "14" in unison.</i>

13:15.217 --> 13:18.237
It was perfect.

13:19.217 --> 13:20.842
Sorry.
Muscle memory.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.467
Time to show America
that their mommy and daddy

13:27.551 --> 13:31.239
- are truly happy together.
- Just like John and Jackie.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.175
Minus the barbiturates.

13:33.259 --> 13:36.008
<i>You're watching Fox News.</i>

13:36.092 --> 13:39.467
<i>And now, "The First Family:
a Modern Day Camelot."</i>

13:39.551 --> 13:41.634
<i>Here's your host,
Sean-athan Hannity.</i>

13:41.717 --> 13:43.967
The White House.
It's the executive office

13:44.050 --> 13:46.050
of the President
of the United States!

13:46.134 --> 13:48.883
But to Donald and Melania Trump,
it's home.

13:52.925 --> 13:54.592
So, yeah, this is my office.

13:54.676 --> 13:56.676
Oh, you couldn't get
the corner office, huh?

13:58.300 --> 14:00.551
We then ventured
to the living room.

14:00.634 --> 14:03.967
Yeah, at night, we just veg
on the couch, watch HGTV,

14:04.050 --> 14:05.883
maybe binge
Lou Dobbs' "Moneyline."

14:05.967 --> 14:10.175
- And, uh, who gets the remote?
- He's a bit of a control freak!

14:10.259 --> 14:12.592
And then we
ventured to the bedroom.

14:12.676 --> 14:15.676
Okay, I gotta ask.
Does he snore?

14:15.758 --> 14:18.217
I don't know because
I sleep down the hall.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.925
He had sex with a porn star
while I was nursing.

14:21.008 --> 14:24.509
Plus, his body is a 300-pound
clanking steam radiator.

14:24.592 --> 14:27.964
Now that I'm hearing this,
I'm realizing only perverts

14:27.965 --> 14:29.426
would share the same bed.

14:29.509 --> 14:32.175
I feel like I just watched
our wedding video.

14:32.259 --> 14:34.175
Minus your first dance
with the cake.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.383
Great news, Mom and Dad ...

14:37.384 --> 14:39.426
Oh, I mean, uh, Melania and Dad.

14:39.509 --> 14:43.259
Mitt Romney has re-invited you
to speak at his rally on Saturday.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.551
He's globalist scum,
but, boy,

14:45.634 --> 14:48.300
does Utah have
a prime ethnic breakdown.

14:48.384 --> 14:50.592
You know, Melania and I
are not very political,

14:50.676 --> 14:52.717
so we won't tell you
who to vote for.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.734
- We just want you to vote.
- I believe that

14:56.758 --> 15:00.134
all Americans' voices
should be heard.

15:02.342 --> 15:04.050
I'm gonna keep doing the speech.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.634
- I-Is that okay, honeybear?
- Yes.

15:06.717 --> 15:08.800
See you when you're done,
pookiehead.

15:08.883 --> 15:12.217
Okay, bye.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.217
All rapists are Mexican!

15:14.300 --> 15:16.967
<i>Welcome to the
Championships at Wimbledon.</i>

15:17.050 --> 15:18.925
<i>Today,
the Gentlemen's Singles Finals,</i>

15:19.008 --> 15:20.800
<i>sponsored by
Sir Humphrey's Doormats.</i>

15:20.883 --> 15:22.717
<i>"Wipe your feet Sir Humphrey's way."</i>

15:22.800 --> 15:25.092
Who knew that being good boys
would get us invites

15:25.175 --> 15:28.676
to such prestigious events
with such appetizing grass?

15:28.758 --> 15:31.508
<i>Match point.
Quiet, please.</i>

15:31.509 --> 15:32.924
<i>Play.</i>

15:34.384 --> 15:37.383
 Holy crap, Eric.
Everyone is so quiet.

15:37.384 --> 15:40.050
Don, I see
that glint in your eye.

15:40.134 --> 15:44.134
- Don't scream "ass."
- But it's who I am. It's in my DNA.

15:44.217 --> 15:46.050
- Ass.
- Don, no.

15:46.134 --> 15:48.050
We're being good boys
so that Mom and Dad

15:48.134 --> 15:51.842
will stay together until
the 2018 midterms, man!

15:51.925 --> 15:56.799
- Ass... Ass...
- Don, don't say "ass"!

15:57.676 --> 15:59.592
<i>The match has been
rendered invalid.</i>

15:59.676 --> 16:02.592
<i>We now invite everyone
to emphatically utter criticisms</i>

16:02.676 --> 16:05.551
<i>at the American President's sons.</i>

16:05.634 --> 16:08.092
<i>Aww, these tossers is dodgy blokes, eh?</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:11.509
Nice going, Eric. Now no
one can hear me scream "ass"!

16:11.592 --> 16:13.509
Ass! Ass!

16:13.592 --> 16:15.925
Wow, Melania, that was really fun.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.642
- It's just ... Oh, never mind.
- I just ...

16:18.677 --> 16:20.175
Remember when you chimed
in during the rally?

16:20.259 --> 16:22.467
You kind of turned it
into the Melania Show.

16:22.551 --> 16:24.342
All I said was, "I believe

16:24.426 --> 16:26.967
that all Americans' voices
should be heard."

16:27.050 --> 16:29.387
And the only reason
I chimed in was because

16:29.422 --> 16:31.676
you wanted to pretend
the podium was a tractor.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.467
Okay, you're clearly hysterical.

16:33.551 --> 16:36.634
- Forget it. I'm over it.
- Fine. I'm also over it.

16:36.717 --> 16:38.883
Over what? I've already
forgotten all about ...

16:38.967 --> 16:41.925
"I'm Melania.
This is all about me.

16:42.008 --> 16:44.342
I believe blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah."

16:44.426 --> 16:45.966
Let's get some questions,

16:45.967 --> 16:49.300
like, "Who thought a campaign
called Be Best was a good idea?"

16:49.384 --> 16:53.102
"I am Donald Trump, and
I am a human trash barge."

16:53.137 --> 16:54.670
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up!

16:54.705 --> 16:56.299
- I am not trash barge!
- No, you shut up! This is so ...

16:56.334 --> 16:57.551
After that, President Trump

16:57.634 --> 16:59.800
ran away with Melania's
umbrella in a hailstorm,

16:59.883 --> 17:02.092
and Melania dangled the ladder
to Marine One

17:02.175 --> 17:04.134
just out of the President's reach...

17:04.217 --> 17:07.050
When we come back, presidential
historian Michael Beschloss

17:07.134 --> 17:09.425
on the history of First Couples
publicly engaging

17:09.509 --> 17:11.108
in escalating slights and humiliations.

17:12.967 --> 17:15.883
We're sorry we were such
bad boys at Wimbledon, Dad.

17:15.967 --> 17:19.509
Too late. For a probationary
period, you're no longer Trumps.

17:19.592 --> 17:23.299
Sure, Dad, but what name will they
call out at the podiatrist's office?

17:23.300 --> 17:25.175
Your new last name is "Johnson."

17:25.259 --> 17:28.676
Eric Johnson, you own a small
chain of hair salons in Delaware

17:28.758 --> 17:31.509
called "Eric's Hair Repair
Haircare by Eric."

17:31.592 --> 17:34.925
Don Jr. Johnson, you live
in a studio in Coral Gables,

17:35.008 --> 17:36.800
and twice a month,
you have "wine night"

17:36.883 --> 17:41.217
with your landlady, Tanya Navarro.
Now go live your lives.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.467
Don't worry, Eric.
We'll fix this.

17:43.551 --> 17:45.996
Johnsons always find a way!

17:47.134 --> 17:49.717
Melania, I noticed you've been
walking around the house

17:49.800 --> 17:51.383
with movers, cursing my name,

17:51.384 --> 17:53.467
and tearfully saying
goodbye to the staff.

17:53.551 --> 17:55.151
- Is something up?
- I'm leaving you.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.217
Oh, so you're doing
that trip to Brussels?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.384
Just bring me back
some chocolate, waffles,

17:59.467 --> 18:01.384
whatever you can fit
into the fuselage.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.049
No, I'm leaving you forever.

18:03.050 --> 18:05.883
Spending every waking moment
together doesn't work.

18:05.967 --> 18:08.800
Our whole thing is that we spend
every waking moment apart.

18:08.883 --> 18:11.134
Hold on.
Where is this coming from?

18:11.217 --> 18:14.053
I'm serious.
You're just not the same

18:14.054 --> 18:15.717
badly dressed racist slumlord

18:15.800 --> 18:18.758
- that I fell in love with.
- Really?!

18:18.842 --> 18:21.342
So one mistake, and you jump ship?

18:21.426 --> 18:24.758
How many empty promises
do I have to make to keep you?

18:24.842 --> 18:28.134
At least bring me back a toy!

18:33.134 --> 18:35.467
Don't worry ...
I've been through two breakups,

18:35.551 --> 18:37.091
and I came out fine.

18:37.092 --> 18:39.467
The first one turned out to be
an Apple Care chatbot

18:39.551 --> 18:40.799
who friend-zoned me.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.551
The second one,
we were madly in love,

18:42.634 --> 18:45.384
but I broke it off to come
to this drinks thing with you.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.883
God, I can't believe
I lost my marriage.

18:47.967 --> 18:50.175
Do you know how unattractive
that's gonna make me

18:50.259 --> 18:52.940
- to the women I was sleeping with?
- What do you say

18:52.975 --> 18:55.842
we hop online
and find you a nice child-bride?

18:55.925 --> 18:58.551
You'll feel better once
we co-sign a five-year lease

18:58.634 --> 19:02.008
for a one bedroom, half-bath
with an outdoor common area

19:02.092 --> 19:04.467
where they serve free bagels
every Saturday.

19:04.551 --> 19:07.384
That sounds miserable.

19:07.467 --> 19:11.050
What kind of bagels
we talking here? Bialys?

19:12.467 --> 19:14.384
You know, I got divorced once,

19:14.467 --> 19:17.551
and, sure, now I'm doomed
to an eternity of hellfire,

19:17.634 --> 19:19.758
but it led me to my Michael.

19:19.842 --> 19:23.148
Donald is a complicated man,
Melania. One moment,

19:23.183 --> 19:26.092
he's channeling the Lord's
wishes through his Muslim ban ...

19:26.175 --> 19:29.134
the next, he's sharing a bed
with the star of "Love Fest"

19:29.217 --> 19:31.175
or whatever these porno movies
are called.

19:31.259 --> 19:33.384
"Indiana Ass
and The Ass Crusade."

19:34.551 --> 19:38.883
- I invited over a friend from work.
- Do you know James Mattis?

19:38.967 --> 19:40.967
He's old and has
a speech impediment.

19:41.050 --> 19:42.758
I think you'll like him!

19:42.842 --> 19:45.259
Me and Melania are on the outs,

19:45.342 --> 19:47.300
so I'm going for more
of a divorced dad vibe.

19:47.384 --> 19:49.842
Lot of conversations
with one leg up on a chair,

19:49.925 --> 19:51.634
crotch too close to your face.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.967
Don, why aren't you
in Coral Gables?

19:56.050 --> 19:57.717
The stewardess said my dirt bike

19:57.800 --> 20:01.259
wouldn't fit in the overhead bin,
but she didn't even try.

20:01.342 --> 20:03.883
The trick is to put yourself
in the overhead bin

20:03.967 --> 20:07.509
- and give your motorbike the seat.
- We're having a meeting!

20:07.592 --> 20:11.341
- I don't "meet." I just "am."
- I am Ben.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.758
He's having a little trouble processing

20:13.842 --> 20:15.883
what Mommy and Daddy
are going through.

20:15.967 --> 20:20.508
- Dr. Perlsteen says it's just a phase.
- It's not a phase!

20:20.509 --> 20:22.467
And tell Dr. Perlsteen
to stop making me

20:22.551 --> 20:24.592
draw pictures of my feelings!

20:24.676 --> 20:27.426
Why can't you and Mom-lania
just get back together?

20:27.509 --> 20:31.676
Don't bother. You've been disinvited
from the Mitt Romney rally.

20:31.758 --> 20:35.217
Your separation has
made you politically toxic.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.801
Somebody get me a piece
of paper and a crayon! Now!

20:40.092 --> 20:44.842
- Do I hear wedding bells?
- Reminds me of us on our first date,

20:44.925 --> 20:47.092
except my other mother isn't here.

20:47.175 --> 20:50.092
Well, usually after work, I go home,

20:50.175 --> 20:53.842
sit on an itchy brown couch,
and stare into space.

20:53.925 --> 20:55.466
Y-You should come over sometime.

20:55.467 --> 20:57.300
What's your favorite
Hungry-Man entrée?

20:57.384 --> 21:00.925
- That sounds miserable.
- Well, not if you love sodium.

21:01.008 --> 21:03.259
Thank you, Mattis, for showing me

21:03.342 --> 21:06.426
what the dating options are
for a woman over 40.

21:06.509 --> 21:10.134
I know I live five miles away,
but mind if I splice your cable?

21:10.217 --> 21:12.758
<i> Mitt Romney
holding his largest rally yet</i>

21:12.842 --> 21:15.217
<i>while rumors percolate
that Donald and Melania Trump</i>

21:15.300 --> 21:17.008
<i>will soon announce a divorce.</i>

21:17.092 --> 21:20.008
<i>Will the country fall into
disarray without the steady hand</i>

21:20.092 --> 21:22.758
<i>or whatever of our First Lady?</i>

21:22.842 --> 21:24.258
You owe me big for this.

21:24.259 --> 21:26.967
I think announcing our divorce
at the Romney rally

21:27.050 --> 21:29.997
will really piss off that Mormon.

21:31.342 --> 21:35.134
- So... how have you been?
- Really good, actually.

21:35.217 --> 21:37.050
I've already met someone.

21:37.134 --> 21:39.342
Do you know Secretary
of Defense James Mattis?

21:39.426 --> 21:41.717
Yeah, I know him.
He's in my Cabinet.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.924
I guess you could say I'm his boss.
Just know he gets around.

21:44.925 --> 21:46.525
And how are you?

21:46.551 --> 21:49.092
Oh, you know.
Still doing the president thing.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.883
Got my eyes on a few prospects.

21:50.967 --> 21:54.716
Secretary of Transportation Elaine
Chao's looking good these days.

21:54.717 --> 21:57.217
She's married to McConnell,
but come on.

21:58.592 --> 22:00.800
Boys, if the Trumps
come anywhere near here,

22:00.883 --> 22:03.259
neutralize them the Romney way ...

22:03.342 --> 22:06.300
compliment their sweaters until
they get bored and walk away.

22:06.384 --> 22:09.075
Compliment their sweaters
until they walk away.

22:09.259 --> 22:11.326
Compliment their sweaters
until they walk away.

22:11.509 --> 22:13.800
Compliment their sweaters
until they walk away.

22:13.883 --> 22:15.341
You're doing great, Ben.

22:19.592 --> 22:21.800
<i>Holy crap, I landed the plane.</i>

22:21.883 --> 22:26.692
- So, you... ready to do this?
- Yes. God, yes, I am.

22:26.717 --> 22:28.842
Dad, Mo Rocca, don't do it!

22:28.925 --> 22:31.967
I was just drawing a picture of
my anger, and I realized that,

22:32.050 --> 22:33.676
between dealing
with my own divorce

22:33.758 --> 22:35.758
and starting
a motorbike-friendly airline,

22:35.842 --> 22:37.509
I need some stability in my life.

22:37.592 --> 22:40.259
And this is no time
to alienate your base.

22:40.342 --> 22:43.134
Wow, you guys are
being good boys.

22:43.217 --> 22:44.757
You're looking out for your dad.

22:44.758 --> 22:46.758
Eric, stop looking at me.
I'm looking at you.

22:49.384 --> 22:51.634
You know, Donald Trump
may have endorsed me,

22:51.717 --> 22:54.509
but his family values
are not Romney family values.

22:54.592 --> 22:57.342
Sure, we Romney types
have strong urges to fornicate

22:57.426 --> 22:59.592
with porn stars,
and our whole life feels like

22:59.676 --> 23:02.092
a soda bottle shaken up
and dropped off a ledge,

23:02.175 --> 23:04.134
and, one day,
the bottle will go kaboom,

23:04.217 --> 23:06.509
and you'll read about
some pretty disgusting stuff

23:06.592 --> 23:08.925
in the Sunday paper,
but we'll deal with that then.

23:10.509 --> 23:13.300
Hello, Mr. President.
Nice sweater.

23:13.384 --> 23:16.799
- I'm not wearing a sweater.
- Darn it!

23:16.800 --> 23:20.092
Take a hike, Mitt. Melania
and I have an announcement.

23:20.175 --> 23:23.967
Sorry, this stage is for respectable
American families only.

23:26.259 --> 23:30.342
What in the name of Sandra Oh is that?!
Boys, avert your eyes!

23:30.426 --> 23:33.966
So, we came here tonight to
announce that we're Splitsville...

23:33.967 --> 23:35.967
but that's not going to happen.

23:36.050 --> 23:38.634
The American people
elected a husband and wife

23:38.717 --> 23:41.551
who are happiest when
not spending time together,

23:41.634 --> 23:43.174
just like you.

23:43.175 --> 23:46.426
How many of you drive home
from work,

23:46.509 --> 23:50.551
then spend 45 minutes
idling halfway down the block

23:50.634 --> 23:53.342
to avoid going inside?

23:53.426 --> 23:57.467
We all have shitty marriages.
Just like Jackie O!

23:57.551 --> 24:00.300
So, like her, I will make it
work for our nation.

24:00.384 --> 24:02.300
Melania, what do you say?

24:02.384 --> 24:04.967
Will you remain married
to me on paper only?

24:05.050 --> 24:06.758
Sure, whatever!

24:06.842 --> 24:11.300
- She's in love, people!
- I didn't say that, no, no, no!

24:11.384 --> 24:13.551
<i>The Obamas.
They shared the same bed.</i>

24:13.634 --> 24:15.509
- We can't...
- Got another rally tomorrow.

24:15.592 --> 24:18.854
Now that we're not separating,
everybody and their conservative

24:18.889 --> 24:20.998
- mother is on my jock.
- That's fine.

24:21.053 --> 24:24.050
I have a facial booked at 3 p.m.
in Seoul, South Korea.

24:24.134 --> 24:26.426
All right, I'm off to
my bedroom down the hall.

24:26.509 --> 24:28.592
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Donald.

24:30.592 --> 24:34.342
<i> Melania!
What channel is Fox News?</i>

24:34.426 --> 24:38.967
<i>- Twenty-three. Now shut up!
- Melania, I'm thirsty!</i>

24:39.050 --> 24:42.299
<i>- Can you get me some water?
- I'm sleeping!</i>

24:42.300 --> 24:45.342
<i>Melania, where do we go
when we die?</i>

24:45.426 --> 24:48.614
