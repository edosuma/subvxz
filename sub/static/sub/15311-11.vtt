<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:03.250 --> 00:04.616
Who the hell are you?

00:04.618 --> 00:06.451
I know you're related
to Nina Carlisle.

00:06.453 --> 00:09.554
Trust me, you don't want
to get involved in this.

00:09.556 --> 00:12.724
You're Kate Renner.
Nina's mother.

00:16.261 --> 00:18.501
- Glad you could make it.
- What do you want?

00:18.569 --> 00:21.281
I need a friend
inside Duncan's operation.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.067
You're talking to the wrong girl.

00:23.069 --> 00:25.235
Okay, a spy.

00:26.105 --> 00:27.105
What are you offering?

00:29.174 --> 00:30.708
Just because
we're sleeping together,

00:30.710 --> 00:34.311
you do not get to treat me
like your secretary.

00:37.648 --> 00:40.517
- OTI has to end.
- You want to dismantle it?

00:40.519 --> 00:42.252
I want to expose it.

00:42.254 --> 00:46.223
OTI is important. Don't give this bastard
a chance to take that away from you.

00:46.225 --> 00:50.326
Do we really want to bet the future
of this country on Dr. Sanders?

00:50.328 --> 00:52.261
Or Duncan Carlisle?

00:52.263 --> 00:56.666
They tried and failed. Why should we
believe they'll pull it off this time?

00:56.668 --> 00:59.869
SANDRINE: Kramer took a photo of a guy
talking to the Secret Service agent.

00:59.871 --> 01:01.170
You got a name?

01:01.172 --> 01:04.607
Robert Harper. Former Army Ranger
and decorated sniper.

01:04.608 --> 01:05.941
Sniper?

01:05.943 --> 01:07.176
Did you kill him?

01:07.178 --> 01:09.412
I went to his apartment,
but he wasn't there.

01:09.414 --> 01:12.181
He's on a plane
to New York City right now.

01:12.183 --> 01:15.751
If he's trying to kill you, why
is he on his way to New York?

01:15.753 --> 01:17.919
Because I'm not the target.

01:18.588 --> 01:20.622
The President is.

01:20.624 --> 01:23.291
He's scheduled to be
in New York all day tomorrow.

01:23.293 --> 01:25.627
If they succeed, Nina dies.

01:25.629 --> 01:27.795
Then we need to get there first.

01:42.177 --> 01:44.378
The president is gonna be
in New York today.

01:44.380 --> 01:48.616
Another team is being assembled
to take him out while he's there.

01:48.618 --> 01:51.118
- We have to stop them.
- Hold up there.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.755
- How exactly is that on us?
- Target goes away, our payday goes away.

01:54.757 --> 01:57.291
- Our deal is with you.
- Your deal is to complete the mission.

01:57.293 --> 01:59.593
We can't do that if somebody
beats us to the punch.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.697
So how do we do it?

02:07.402 --> 02:10.070
None of this is your fault.

02:10.072 --> 02:12.606
You didn't ask for this,
and you don't deserve it.

02:12.608 --> 02:14.474
But now that we're here,

02:14.476 --> 02:17.343
we have to do everything we can
to make the right decisions.

02:19.513 --> 02:22.448
We shouldn't be helping
these people.

02:22.450 --> 02:25.785
- What about when we don't have a choice?
- You always have a choice.

02:25.787 --> 02:28.921
- Mom says we need to cooperate.
- Cooperate? Yeah.

02:28.923 --> 02:30.889
Not collaborate.

02:30.891 --> 02:33.926
- What does that mean?
- It means that

02:33.928 --> 02:38.164
when this is over I want you to be able
to look at yourselves in the mirror.

02:38.166 --> 02:42.167
I don't want to let them turn you
into something that you're not.

02:43.537 --> 02:46.905
They made you lie
to Boyd's father about his death.

02:46.907 --> 02:50.042
And they made you come up
with a phony alibi for Kramer.

02:51.477 --> 02:52.778
Where is this gonna end?

02:52.780 --> 02:55.413
- With Mom killing the president.
- I don't accept that.

02:58.518 --> 03:00.653
And if it does, then...

03:00.655 --> 03:04.256
If it does, then what?

03:09.362 --> 03:12.230
I don't want this family
to lose its way.

03:12.232 --> 03:13.998
(FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN STAIRS)

03:16.969 --> 03:19.871
Everybody on your feet.
You're coming with us.

03:19.873 --> 03:21.773
Let's go. Move! Get up!

03:24.476 --> 03:25.743
Move! Up!

03:34.086 --> 03:35.286
I'm glad you called.

03:37.922 --> 03:40.090
So all I gotta do is
tell you what's going on?

03:40.092 --> 03:43.627
Like I said last night,
all I need is information.

03:43.629 --> 03:46.163
Where people are,
what they're doing.

03:46.165 --> 03:48.332
You're my eyes and ears.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.201
I want to know if Duncan's
sticking to the plan,

03:50.203 --> 03:52.769
that he's watching
the Sanders family 24/7.

03:52.771 --> 03:54.738
And, if he's not, call me.

03:54.740 --> 03:57.539
How do I know you're gonna
deliver on your end of this?

03:58.375 --> 04:02.679
Two Canadian passports.
One for you, one for your son.

04:04.448 --> 04:05.982
And what about the cash?

04:16.793 --> 04:20.394
Keep it. Consider it
a gesture of good faith.

04:21.098 --> 04:22.998
I'll give you the rest
when this is all over.

04:25.135 --> 04:27.969
10 grand is nothing to the
people I'm working for.

04:28.538 --> 04:31.607
They just wanna know
what's going on with Duncan.

04:31.609 --> 04:34.008
It's an insurance policy.
That's all.

04:36.479 --> 04:37.980
You made the right decision.

04:39.415 --> 04:43.518
Trust me. It's much better
than the alternative.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.753
I've gotta get back.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.461
ARCHER:
Sit down.

04:52.463 --> 04:56.064
Windows are nailed shut.
Door will be locked from the outside.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.734
You're gonna be in here for a while,
so make yourselves comfortable.

04:59.736 --> 05:01.501
What's going on?

05:02.138 --> 05:04.671
None of you are leaving
the house today.

05:08.710 --> 05:10.078
(DRILLING)

05:22.658 --> 05:26.727
I've sent Sandrine and Kramer ahead
to start surveillance on this church.

05:26.729 --> 05:30.463
And to look for the sharp shooter
we saw yesterday, Robert Harper.

05:30.465 --> 05:32.666
You and I are gonna try
and narrow the search.

05:32.668 --> 05:34.668
What do you know about the
president's schedule?

05:34.670 --> 05:39.072
Off the record trips are low-profile.
The goal is to avoid being noticed.

05:39.074 --> 05:40.877
Kincaid will be in an unmarked SUV,

05:40.917 --> 05:43.592
without the usual number
of Secret Service agents.

05:43.627 --> 05:46.046
They'll most likely bring him
through this back alley, here.

05:46.048 --> 05:47.947
Why don't we simply call in
a bomb threat?

05:47.949 --> 05:51.284
- Make them divert his plans.
- If we do anything to make

05:51.286 --> 05:54.421
Kincaid's security detail suspect
there's a plot against him,

05:54.423 --> 05:57.457
protocol dictates they
completely change his itinerary.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.759
That would include
the location of his surgery,

05:59.761 --> 06:03.196
and the staff performing.
We need to find this other hit team

06:03.198 --> 06:07.099
and take them out, without
anybody knowing it happened.

06:07.101 --> 06:10.436
Hello, it's Burton.
Am I all set on that flight to Madrid?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.306
Two tickets.

06:13.308 --> 06:15.842
For myself,
and for my granddaughter.

06:17.510 --> 06:21.112
Okay. Let me know
as soon as possible.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.147
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:33.159 --> 06:35.728
- Kate.
- Hello, Burton.

06:35.730 --> 06:36.995
Come inside.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.869
What are you doing here?
I thought we had an arrangement.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.937
I know. I'm sorry.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.006
You shouldn't be here, ever.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.575
- A woman came to see me.
- Yes?

06:50.577 --> 06:53.811
- Dr. Sanders.
- Why didn't you tell me Nina was sick?

06:53.813 --> 06:56.781
(SIGHS)
Because...

06:56.783 --> 07:00.785
we always said you would move on
with your life and put Nina behind you.

07:00.787 --> 07:04.856
- Why burden you with her health problems?
- She's still my daughter.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.892
- I had a right to know.
- Is that why you're here, Kate?

07:10.495 --> 07:12.796
I'm here because I
want to tell my story.

07:14.799 --> 07:16.934
I want to expose Kincaid.

07:26.243 --> 07:27.411
BLAIR:
Things in place in New York?

07:27.413 --> 07:29.078
I just spoke to the team leader.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.847
They landed last night.
They're assembling now.

07:30.849 --> 07:32.482
- Everything's a go.
- Good.

07:32.484 --> 07:34.317
Good. What about the girl?
She accept your offer?

07:34.319 --> 07:35.619
She's in.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.654
Okay. Stay in contact with
her throughout the day.

07:37.656 --> 07:39.389
The minute we're done in New York,
we need to be ready to move

07:39.391 --> 07:40.590
on Duncan and his team.

07:40.592 --> 07:43.393
- I understand.
- Duncan needs to go first.

07:43.395 --> 07:44.460
Then the others.

07:45.729 --> 07:47.430
What about the Sanders family?

07:49.499 --> 07:51.935
(SIGHS)
Make it a murder-suicide.

07:51.937 --> 07:54.503
A weapon will be left
in the father's hand,

07:54.505 --> 07:57.606
with a note, bemoaning his financial
issues and marital problems.

08:01.812 --> 08:05.247
It's never pleasant taking
out innocent civilians,

08:05.249 --> 08:07.349
but we don't have a choice.

08:29.492 --> 08:31.794
If I were them, I'd be looking
to get some elevation.

08:31.796 --> 08:33.895
Only a few structures
in the vicinity

08:33.898 --> 08:36.732
have the heightened position to
give you an angle on that alley.

08:36.734 --> 08:40.135
The sniper team will be looking for a
quick exit to a major thoroughfare.

08:40.136 --> 08:42.270
I only see three buildings
that fit the bill.

08:42.273 --> 08:45.640
- One. Two. Three.
- Yeah.

08:45.642 --> 08:47.615
- Which one will they use?
- Don't know yet,

08:47.625 --> 08:49.345
but a sniper's only
as good as his spotter,

08:49.380 --> 08:51.313
and a spotter is only
as good as his vantage point.

08:51.315 --> 08:53.081
We need more information.

08:53.083 --> 08:56.718
We don't have enough time to do an internal
recon in three high-rise buildings.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.286
You're right.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.690
We need the blueprints for each
building with complete specifications.

09:01.692 --> 09:02.858
How are we gonna get those?

09:05.395 --> 09:08.196
After that doctor left,
I started thinking

09:08.198 --> 09:10.564
about all those secrets I kept,

09:11.166 --> 09:12.733
for so long.

09:13.402 --> 09:14.769
I got angry.

09:16.738 --> 09:19.106
I've told my husband everything.

09:19.775 --> 09:23.011
Kate, we had a deal.

09:23.013 --> 09:26.914
And I can only imagine
how difficult

09:26.916 --> 09:29.049
- these past years...
- Decades!

09:29.051 --> 09:31.084
...decades have been for you,

09:32.721 --> 09:37.657
but Kincaid's a dangerous man.
I don't need to tell you that.

09:38.359 --> 09:41.796
He's a lot more powerful
than he was 35 years ago.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.196
I'll take my chances.

09:44.498 --> 09:47.600
I think I'm old enough to make
that decision for myself.

09:47.602 --> 09:49.669
Hm. What about for Nina?

09:49.671 --> 09:51.238
She's at risk as well.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.640
Nina has terminal leukemia.

09:53.642 --> 09:57.978
According to that doctor, there's no
match for her bone marrow, right?

09:57.980 --> 10:01.747
I want my daughter to know
the truth before she dies.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.583
We haven't given up.

10:13.393 --> 10:15.027
I need something from you.

10:15.029 --> 10:17.063
I want schematics on three
buildings in New York.

10:17.065 --> 10:19.510
- Schematics? What for?
- Your firm has a password

10:19.545 --> 10:22.435
for the property clerk's database
in most major cities, correct?

10:22.437 --> 10:25.571
Yeah, they do, but I can't
access them whenever I want.

10:25.573 --> 10:28.539
- It's not that simple.
- Why do you need the specs?

10:29.843 --> 10:30.876
It's important

10:32.178 --> 10:33.912
to all of us.

10:33.914 --> 10:36.214
Well, I'm sorry.
There are a lot of regulations.

10:36.216 --> 10:38.851
Privacy, security restrictions.

10:38.853 --> 10:40.752
Can't help you.

10:42.989 --> 10:44.556
Can't? Or won't?

10:49.895 --> 10:50.895
Both.

10:53.466 --> 10:55.500
You still haven't
learned anything, Brian.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.805
On your feet. Let's go.

11:02.174 --> 11:03.241
- Mom!
- Mom!

11:03.243 --> 11:05.342
Where are you taking her?

11:05.344 --> 11:06.410
Mom!

11:07.980 --> 11:09.446
(DOOR LOCKING)

11:26.031 --> 11:27.931
You wanted to tell me something?

11:27.933 --> 11:30.333
I think I can get
the schematics you need.

11:30.868 --> 11:33.070
- Good.
- But I want to know.

11:35.706 --> 11:39.508
What's it for? I know the
president is in New York today.

11:40.077 --> 11:43.646
What are...
Are you gonna kill him?

11:44.281 --> 11:47.083
No. I'm gonna save him.

11:49.754 --> 11:52.655
But I need those specs, Ellen.
Soon.

11:55.225 --> 11:57.259
(SIGHS)

11:57.894 --> 11:59.761
Here.

12:13.376 --> 12:15.810
If I fail in New York, Ellen,

12:17.047 --> 12:19.914
if you hear that the
president has been killed,

12:20.717 --> 12:24.887
then you need to go upstairs,
free your family,

12:24.889 --> 12:28.356
and get the hell out of here.
Fast.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.748
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

12:31.820 --> 12:33.897
(MURMURING)
Yes.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.068
I know you'll never
believe me, but...

12:43.206 --> 12:45.972
I wish you never
had to be involved.

13:04.524 --> 13:05.977
Thank you for coming.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.485
I was really surprised
that you called me.

13:08.930 --> 13:12.464
I thought you guys were in Montreal?
Why isn't Brian back at the office?

13:12.466 --> 13:15.968
Well, that's why I'm here.
Brian...

13:15.970 --> 13:19.972
- got himself into some financial trouble.
- I don't understand.

13:19.974 --> 13:24.343
Well, the company is heavily leveraged.
Deeply, deeply in debt.

13:24.345 --> 13:29.045
Then about six months ago, he borrowed
a large sum of money from some people.

13:29.615 --> 13:33.850
The wrong people. And then when
he couldn't pay them back

13:36.489 --> 13:40.291
they, uh, they threatened
to hurt our family.

13:40.293 --> 13:41.408
What?

13:41.428 --> 13:43.767
That's why he dropped
the passports off that day.

13:43.802 --> 13:45.296
We thought we had to get out
of the country in a hurry.

13:45.298 --> 13:47.331
Why didn't Brian say
anything to me?

13:47.333 --> 13:50.301
Well, I don't think he
wanted to get you involved.

13:50.303 --> 13:54.704
He's out of town right now, but
he really needs your help.

13:54.939 --> 13:57.708
We need your help.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.610
Uh...

13:59.612 --> 14:03.213
I don't blame you for
anything that happened.

14:03.215 --> 14:06.049
All I care about right now
is protecting my family.

14:06.051 --> 14:08.318
Why don't you go to the police?

14:08.320 --> 14:11.054
That would make it even worse.
I mean, these people are really dangerous.

14:11.056 --> 14:15.225
- They would hurt our kids.
- (SOFTLY) Right.

14:15.227 --> 14:17.127
Well, what do you need from me?

14:17.129 --> 14:19.862
Your company access code.

14:19.864 --> 14:22.999
We need the schematics for
three buildings in New York.

14:23.001 --> 14:27.670
For the business deal, just to help
Brian dig himself out of this mess.

14:31.142 --> 14:33.876
Ah. This is Nina's sixth
birthday party.

14:36.246 --> 14:40.883
And why does the boy standing next to
her have frosting all over his face?

14:40.885 --> 14:44.720
Oh, that's Alex. He lived
two doors down. Bit of a bully.

14:44.722 --> 14:48.290
Alex made the mistake of
trying to take Nina's cupcake,

14:48.292 --> 14:50.559
and she shoved it in his face.

14:50.561 --> 14:54.396
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)
So Nina was a tough one?

14:56.166 --> 14:58.133
She still is.

14:59.869 --> 15:03.204
According to the doctors, she
should have been dead months ago.

15:04.507 --> 15:09.578
She's a fighter. You did a
wonderful job raising her, Burton.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.780
I would have liked
to have been a part of it.

15:12.882 --> 15:14.716
But I'm glad she had you.

15:14.718 --> 15:17.285
She still does.
I'll never give up on her.

15:17.287 --> 15:21.122
(SIGHS) I just put all of this
out of my head for so long.

15:21.124 --> 15:24.325
You, Nina, Kincaid.

15:24.327 --> 15:27.428
Now it's just rushing back,
like a fresh wound.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.536
And the enormity of what
he did to all of our lives.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.807
God, it just makes me so angry.

15:39.809 --> 15:42.375
But in the end, we won.

15:42.377 --> 15:45.045
We beat him. Nina grew up

15:45.047 --> 15:48.749
protected from any knowledge
of that terrible past.

15:48.751 --> 15:53.052
You forged a new life!
You have a husband, a home.

15:54.489 --> 15:58.757
Go back to it, Kate.
You don't want to stir up any ghosts.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.360
No.

16:02.463 --> 16:04.863
I kept quiet for too long.

16:05.366 --> 16:09.235
You said it yourself.
Nina is a fighter.

16:09.604 --> 16:12.871
I wanna show her
I'm a fighter too.

__

16:30.990 --> 16:32.924
What's up?

16:32.926 --> 16:35.827
Nothing. It's about my son.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.562
Was that his father?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.766
No, his father and I don't talk.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.470
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.372
It's a good thing.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.674
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.146
I met him when I was working
undercover in Mexico.

16:55.614 --> 16:56.848
It didn't end well.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.885
That's why I don't let my
feelings interfere with business.

they took Mom?

17:05.892 --> 17:08.059
(BRIAN SHAKING DOOR)

17:08.060 --> 17:10.494
They won't hurt her.
They need her for the surgery.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.896
What was that all about?

17:12.897 --> 17:14.598
Why do they need building plans?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.099
I'm not sure.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.468
Then you should have
just given them to him.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.906
It doesn't matter what we do anyway.
We can't stop them.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.510
If you believe that, then
they've already won.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.645
Morgan, look at me.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.848
They put a bullet in me.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.251
They took over my house.
They terrorized my family.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.721
They threatened everything
I care about in this world.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.122
And I'm not defeated.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.526
And I'm not going
to let them defeat you.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.500
It's not a physical battle.

17:52.703 --> 17:55.004
It's psychological.

17:55.006 --> 17:59.075
So long as we're united, so
long as we're together on this.

17:59.077 --> 18:02.310
We're so much stronger
than they'll ever be.

18:02.780 --> 18:05.815
It doesn't matter how
many guns they have.

18:18.194 --> 18:22.197
Look, when this
whole thing is over,

18:25.935 --> 18:28.302
I don't want to say
goodbye to you.

18:30.774 --> 18:32.007
I understand.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.210
I feel the same way.

If something does happen today,

18:52.995 --> 18:54.061
I'm sorry.

TED: I just don't see why
your trip to St. Theodore's

19:15.484 --> 19:17.618
should be off the record,
Mr. President.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.753
It's a great PR story.

19:19.755 --> 19:23.056
A personal prayer visit to a church
built by your great-grandfather?

19:25.159 --> 19:27.828
That's a no-brainer to grab
more of the Christian vote.

19:27.830 --> 19:31.798
I spend 90% of my day
on empty gestures, Ted.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.635
Every once in a while, I have to do
something that actually has meaning.

19:36.938 --> 19:40.841
Listen. I know I'm a sinner.

19:40.843 --> 19:43.310
I have many flaws.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.878
I make no apologies
for most of them.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.779
It's simply my nature.

19:48.248 --> 19:50.883
But I try to make my peace
with God, nevertheless.

19:52.453 --> 19:55.921
And if I'm gonna have even the
slimmest hope for redemption,

19:57.958 --> 20:01.427
I can't exploit that by
turning it into a photo op.

20:08.534 --> 20:12.371
Things move fast after an assassination.
You recall the chaos when Reagan was shot?

20:12.373 --> 20:15.207
- And that was unsuccessful.
- First priority.

20:15.209 --> 20:19.544
Are we absolutely certain that nothing can
be traced back to us or our partners?

20:19.546 --> 20:21.112
There's no direct money trail.

20:21.114 --> 20:23.281
The team we have in
place are professionals.

20:23.283 --> 20:26.618
- They'll disappear the minute it's over.
- And then?

20:26.620 --> 20:30.255
NSA intercepts will be leaked to the press
implicating a foreign terrorist cell.

20:30.257 --> 20:32.242
Money transfers will point
to the involvement

20:32.245 --> 20:34.077
of a certain Middle Eastern country.

20:34.112 --> 20:36.660
And the rumor mill will
take it from there.

20:36.662 --> 20:39.264
And my sister will
never know the truth.

20:39.266 --> 20:41.766
Not that she's ever
been interested in it.

20:41.768 --> 20:44.335
When will you move on the
FBI agent and his team?

20:44.337 --> 20:46.604
As soon as the operation
is confirmed.

20:46.606 --> 20:49.260
Wilson. Get a GPS
trace up on the phone

20:49.374 --> 20:51.415
Carlisle was using
to communicate with Logan.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.277
I want you to start
monitoring his position.

20:53.279 --> 20:55.846
- The rest of his team, too.
- WILSON: Yes, sir!

20:55.848 --> 20:58.015
The foreign terrorist cell
is a nice touch.

20:58.017 --> 21:00.885
It will set things up perfectly
with the vice president.

21:00.887 --> 21:03.320
- When are you speaking with him?
- I'm on my way now.

21:03.322 --> 21:06.990
We're going to discuss potential running
mates for his presidential campaign.

21:06.992 --> 21:08.926
Are you confident you have his ear?

21:08.928 --> 21:10.527
100%.

21:10.529 --> 21:13.496
When I'm finished, you will
be at the top of his list.

21:27.422 --> 21:29.923
Ellen! Hi.

21:29.925 --> 21:32.326
I think I got everything
you asked for.

21:32.328 --> 21:36.796
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No, thank you.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.200
You know, I really admire you.

21:40.202 --> 21:41.501
I do.

21:42.603 --> 21:44.204
The way you're standing by him.

21:45.873 --> 21:50.711
The only reason I got involved with Brian
is just the way he described things.

21:50.713 --> 21:53.613
The way, the way things
were between you two.

21:53.615 --> 21:55.715
The way things were between us?

21:57.318 --> 22:01.254
He told me
that your marriage was a lie.

22:01.256 --> 22:03.590
But clearly that's not the case.

22:03.592 --> 22:06.729
The fact that you're doing
all of this for him,

22:06.769 --> 22:08.852
even after finding out about us, I,

22:08.887 --> 22:13.065
I admire it and I'm
so, so sorry, Ellen.

22:13.067 --> 22:17.236
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, Samantha.

22:18.972 --> 22:20.106
Thank you.

22:25.979 --> 22:28.547
(BEEPING) Sir, I can't track
Agent Carlisle's phone.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.350
Did you try the girl?

22:31.352 --> 22:32.984
The one Logan has working
for us in Duncan's group?

22:32.986 --> 22:36.355
Can't reach her. And there's nothing
emanating from their burner phones.

22:36.357 --> 22:38.624
They removed their batteries.

22:38.626 --> 22:41.693
Start pulling up satellite imagery
and running it through facial recognition.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.928
Find them.
I don't want any loose ends.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.058
Why are we switching burners?

22:50.097 --> 22:52.352
The one calling the shots
isn't playing games.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.874
If they win today, they'll
be looking to get rid of us.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.129
How do you know?

22:57.167 --> 22:59.783
Because that's what I would do
if I were in their shoes.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.180
- What would you pick?
- Hard to say from here.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.883
ARCHER: I think we should split up.
Search all three.

23:07.218 --> 23:10.921
Kincaid will be here
in exactly 72 minutes.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.891
That's not enough time for a proper
sweep on one of these buildings.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.439
We need more info.

23:15.508 --> 23:17.899
Ellen should be calling any minute.
We wait for her.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.630
I think you're putting way
too much faith in her.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.632
I'm not as big a believer.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.736
(CELL RINGING)

23:29.908 --> 23:31.008
Ellen.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.676
I have the plans,

23:32.678 --> 23:34.542
but they're monsters,
like hundreds of pages.

23:34.584 --> 23:35.986
I can't make heads or tails.

23:36.021 --> 23:38.080
Okay, Ellen.
Find the Widmark Tower.

23:38.082 --> 23:39.816
It has all black sheeting.

23:39.818 --> 23:42.452
I need to know what kind of
coating is on the windows.

23:42.454 --> 23:45.087
Um, okay, trying to find it.

23:45.089 --> 23:46.823
DUNCAN:
Focus, Ellen.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.359
All these symbols and markings,
it's like hieroglyphics.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.093
What the hell does it matter
what glass coating?

23:51.095 --> 23:53.462
They're inside the building,
they're not scaling it.

23:53.464 --> 23:55.531
The coating illuminates too much
of the light passing through,

23:55.533 --> 23:57.733
it's going to be very hard for
them to get an accurate view

23:57.735 --> 23:59.936
from that distance
in the afternoon.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.571
ELLEN: Okay, I found it.
The glass is high efficiency-rated,

24:02.573 --> 24:05.007
triple paint, 33% tint.

24:05.009 --> 24:08.910
DUNCAN: Then they're not in there.
Okay Ellen, the Ormont building.

24:08.912 --> 24:10.813
From street level it looks
like it gives a vantage point,

24:10.815 --> 24:12.848
but it's built on a corner lot.

24:12.850 --> 24:15.190
Find the surveyor's report
for the foundation.

24:15.261 --> 24:17.478
I need the exact angle it's built on.

24:17.513 --> 24:21.557
Just look for terms like anchor
bolts, and rebars, stuff like that.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.927
Rebar. Here it is.

24:25.929 --> 24:28.629
Engineer's foundation report,
42.5 degrees.

24:28.631 --> 24:30.165
42 and a half degrees.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.033
That angle,
from the highest floors?

24:34.370 --> 24:36.430
Shooter would have to press his trigger
against the window

24:36.466 --> 24:40.165
to get a good look down 25th.
Too hard a shot.

24:40.477 --> 24:41.642
Building's out.

24:42.811 --> 24:44.579
Then that's the building.

24:44.581 --> 24:46.291
The De Soleil Hotel.

24:46.316 --> 24:48.141
Okay Ellen, I've gotta go.
We don't have much time.

24:48.186 --> 24:51.984
Go home, listen to the news.
If anything happens...

24:53.389 --> 24:55.356
I know what to do.

24:55.358 --> 24:56.957
Good luck.

25:03.932 --> 25:06.967
I feel like I never get to
see you anymore, Vanessa.

25:06.969 --> 25:09.270
You were the best staffer I ever had.

25:09.272 --> 25:11.838
A sacrifice of higher office.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.007
You wanted to be vice president.

25:14.009 --> 25:17.778
No, I didn't. But it was clear Paul Kincaid
was going to get the nomination,

25:17.780 --> 25:19.579
so I just jumped on the ticket.

25:19.581 --> 25:21.180
And as I recall,

25:21.182 --> 25:23.249
you're the one
who advised me to do it.

25:23.251 --> 25:26.152
Politics makes strange bedfellows.

25:26.154 --> 25:27.987
It does indeed.

25:27.989 --> 25:31.557
Which is why I want
your counsel again.

25:31.559 --> 25:34.060
As you might imagine, people are
already beginning to strategize

25:34.062 --> 25:36.195
about the election
two years from now.

25:36.197 --> 25:39.764
So you've made up your mind to run
when Kincaid's second term is up?

25:40.134 --> 25:43.902
- It feels awfully early to think about.
- It's never too early.

25:45.105 --> 25:47.706
So what about Senator Lansbury
as a running mate?

25:47.708 --> 25:49.675
His people have
already approached me.

25:50.911 --> 25:53.546
- No.
- No?

25:53.548 --> 25:55.848
No senators.
No representatives.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.413
Congress has a single-digit
approval rating.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.597
Anybody you pick would be poison.

26:00.632 --> 26:01.970
Since you were a governor,

26:02.037 --> 26:05.104
you can't add another person
with a voting record to the ticket.

26:05.139 --> 26:07.359
(SIGHS)
So where do I look?

26:07.361 --> 26:11.063
You need a fresh face.
Not an elected official.

26:11.065 --> 26:16.534
Someone with instant name recognition,
media appeal and non-partisan credentials.

26:16.536 --> 26:19.204
You'll need international experience
to bolster the ticket and,

26:19.206 --> 26:21.272
since you're from Texas,

26:21.274 --> 26:24.074
you'll need somebody who
can deliver the coasts.

26:26.111 --> 26:28.446
I know exactly who
you're describing.

26:28.448 --> 26:33.249
I'm not describing anybody in particular,
just laying out the facts.

26:34.954 --> 26:37.455
You were always the smartest
person in the room.

26:38.656 --> 26:44.261
The only question is, are
you interested in running?

26:48.266 --> 26:50.718
Kramer, remember snipers
like to work in pairs.

26:50.753 --> 26:52.558
Robert Harper will have a spotter.

26:52.605 --> 26:55.606
Statistically, he's a white male,
20s, 30s.

26:55.608 --> 26:57.608
- Probably wearing sunglasses.
- KRAMER: Sunglasses?

26:57.610 --> 26:59.242
They like to protect their eyes.

27:00.879 --> 27:03.146
- I got nothing.
- Next floor. Let's move.

27:48.190 --> 27:49.557
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:50.892 --> 27:52.360
Sandrine,
I think we found the spotter.

27:52.362 --> 27:55.996
Run room 3609,
meet us at the car in five.

27:55.998 --> 27:58.170
Are you sure you want to go
through with this?

27:58.281 --> 28:00.497
I am.

28:02.237 --> 28:03.304
Okay.

28:04.906 --> 28:07.140
Well, we might as
well do it properly.

28:07.142 --> 28:11.411
I'll go get out my video camera,
and we'll tape your statement.

28:14.749 --> 28:17.585
I never knew Nina was so
much like her mother,

28:17.587 --> 28:19.252
so strong-willed.

28:20.789 --> 28:24.257
You know, I remember one winter,

28:24.259 --> 28:29.362
Nina wanted to stand on her
sled and go down Franklin Hill.

28:29.364 --> 28:32.799
I told her she could get hurt,
and she did.

28:35.035 --> 28:37.837
Later,
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:37.839 --> 28:40.777
when she was being stitched up
at the doctor's office,

28:40.854 --> 28:43.115
I thought I should be mad.

28:43.811 --> 28:47.680
But I wasn't.
I was just scared.

28:47.682 --> 28:53.147
The thought of something happening
to that girl terrified me.

28:53.223 --> 28:57.051
All I wanted was to keep her safe.

28:57.086 --> 28:59.558
And in that moment, I knew that

28:59.560 --> 29:04.296
there was nothing that I
wouldn't do to protect her

29:04.298 --> 29:05.964
for the rest of her life.

29:07.834 --> 29:13.738
I'm asking you, for her sake.
Don't do this.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.241
Reconsider.

29:16.243 --> 29:18.744
If she is going to die,

29:18.746 --> 29:22.714
let her go without knowing
the whole, ugly truth.

29:22.716 --> 29:26.017
If you like, I could talk to Nina.

29:26.485 --> 29:29.086
We could change our arrangement.

29:29.088 --> 29:31.422
You would let the two of
us meet, face-to-face?

29:32.758 --> 29:34.558
Yes.

29:39.031 --> 29:40.097
Okay.

29:41.300 --> 29:44.068
I'll, I'll wait.

29:44.070 --> 29:48.338
I've kept this secret 35 years.
I guess I can keep it a little longer.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.474
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

29:50.476 --> 29:55.445
You have no idea how glad I am
you made that decision, Katherine.

30:03.020 --> 30:05.189
Ran the room.
It was paid in cash,

30:05.191 --> 30:08.158
and the name it was registered
to had no prior addresses

30:08.160 --> 30:09.793
or matching Social Security number.

30:09.795 --> 30:14.364
No doubt it's them.
Keep lookout and stay in communication.

30:14.366 --> 30:16.899
Get behind the wheel
and keep the motor running.

30:17.301 --> 30:19.002
You ready to run 36 floors?

30:19.004 --> 30:21.504
- Time?
- 39 minutes.

30:21.506 --> 30:22.972
Let's do it twice.

30:48.365 --> 30:50.799
Quick. Quiet. Clean.

(MACHINE BLEEPS)

(TASER GOING OFF)

31:10.753 --> 31:12.220
Clear!

31:13.322 --> 31:15.556
That was the spotter.
Where's the shooter?

31:24.767 --> 31:28.502
- The spotter's dead. The sniper's gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

31:28.504 --> 31:30.404
They aren't taking the hit
from the hotel,

31:30.406 --> 31:32.406
they're just using it to get
an eye on Kincaid.

31:32.408 --> 31:34.541
Hold on. Hold on.

31:34.543 --> 31:35.892
I have eyes on the sniper.

31:35.926 --> 31:37.442
Robert Harper,
he's with another white male.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.380
They're both wearing
electric company uniforms.

31:39.382 --> 31:41.781
- DUNCAN: Maintain surveillance.
- SANDRINE: Copy that.

31:49.291 --> 31:51.792
- I've lost them.
- DUNCAN: Don't move.

32:01.535 --> 32:04.837
- What do ya got?
- Look at this.

32:05.039 --> 32:08.275
The church is circled.
This is their plan.

32:08.277 --> 32:09.642
I'm going to go through
the paperwork.

32:09.644 --> 32:12.378
You keep an eye out for Kincaid.
He's minutes away.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.654
Hey, Logan, you're a real ball
of personality, aren't you?

32:21.656 --> 32:24.190
Sorry, Mr. President, I'm just
trying to keep us on schedule.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.525
Ah, we'll be fine.

32:27.894 --> 32:29.461
(MACHINE BEEPING)

32:33.399 --> 32:35.633
Sir, I've got a hit on Duncan Carlisle
in New York.

32:35.674 --> 32:37.648
23rd and Broadway,
15 minutes ago.

32:37.683 --> 32:39.171
Son of a bitch.

32:39.173 --> 32:41.440
BLAIR:
He's at the go location.

32:41.442 --> 32:44.075
He's trying to sabotage
this whole thing.

32:55.352 --> 32:59.387
President's convoy located.
Half click from the church.

33:14.136 --> 33:15.804
Sandrine.

33:15.806 --> 33:19.407
I found a public notice about roadwork
being done on Broadway and 25th.

33:19.409 --> 33:21.918
An electric company van parked there
wouldn't draw any suspicion.

33:22.038 --> 33:25.146
- Get over there now and take 'em out.
- Copy.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.492
Got a red light.
It'll turn soon though.

33:37.494 --> 33:39.260
ARCHER:
They're almost at the church.

33:40.729 --> 33:43.364
Beta, this is Charlie.
Do you have target confirmation yet?

33:43.366 --> 33:45.266
(STATIC)

33:45.268 --> 33:47.835
- Can't establish comm.
- Proceed as planned.

33:47.837 --> 33:50.337
I'll engage the target with
my scope, if necessary.

34:07.322 --> 34:09.288

Kincaid's arriving.

Listen to me.

34:34.047 --> 34:35.681
You have been compromised.

34:35.683 --> 34:39.317
Stay frosty, but I want
this operation carried out.

34:39.319 --> 34:44.288
Copy that, sir. Situation normal here.
Only issue is I've lost comm with Beta.

34:59.705 --> 35:04.407
Two Canadian passports.
One for you, one for your son.

35:14.352 --> 35:18.556
Sandrine. Sandrine!

35:18.558 --> 35:22.758
Where are you? You need to get
to them, and take the shot.

35:24.896 --> 35:27.130
Clear to exit vehicle, sir.

35:40.845 --> 35:41.845
Oof!

35:52.690 --> 35:56.825
You all right?
No falling down on the job, Logan.

35:57.794 --> 36:00.096
Oh. My sole is split.

36:00.098 --> 36:02.498
I think we promoted you
a little too soon, son.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.340
We gotta get out of here.

It's me.

37:04.661 --> 37:07.495
It's over. We did it.

37:07.497 --> 37:09.630
Never lost faith
that you could pull it off.

37:10.799 --> 37:12.199
See you when you get back.

37:25.446 --> 37:28.247
Looks like Aunt Leslie has the flu.

37:28.249 --> 37:32.218
So, we won't be taking
that trip, after all.

37:32.220 --> 37:34.688
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:34.690 --> 37:36.589
But I'll make it up to you
with some ice cream.

37:36.591 --> 37:38.325
Come on.

37:38.327 --> 37:41.227
Then we'll go to the park,
and then to the library!

- Yes.

- Yeah, I'm fine.

- You helped them?
- Yeah, Samantha got them for me.

Nothing important, sweetheart.

I can't believe you did it.

39:18.122 --> 39:20.156
No.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.458
We did it.

have happened today.
