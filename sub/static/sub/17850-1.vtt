02:36.489 --> 02:38.657
Police on scene
are approaching the suspect.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.743
This chase started
at approximately 1:30 a. m...

02:41.911 --> 02:43.579
...in the Mercer Island area...

02:43.746 --> 02:46.248
...and has ended here
at Pearl Street Bridge.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.916
...responding to a 911 call...

02:48.084 --> 02:51.086
...in an apparent carjacking
by an African-American male.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.255
...name is Lisa Reane...

02:53.423 --> 02:55.757
...youngest daughter of
Congressman Richard Reane.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.676
Suspect has been
preliminary ID'd...

02:57.844 --> 03:02.973
...as John Curtis, who's wanted
for armed robbery, drug-

03:03.141 --> 03:05.767
Shots have been fired.
We have shots fired.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.853
The suspect and
his hostage are down.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.105
Police are moving in.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.311
If you chose to believe
a traitor's testimony, fine.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.272
But in the same situation,
I'd do it again.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.441
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing my job.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.610
I'm not gonna
apologize for doing my job.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.893
Simply put, just
because you're a cop...

04:30.061 --> 04:33.146
...doesn't mean the laws
don't apply to you.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.524
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.277
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.487
Not the wild, wild West anymore.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.073
Wild, wild West anymore.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.540
That's 5 and...

05:56.856 --> 05:58.523
Everybody get the fuck down!

05:58.691 --> 05:59.733
Get out of here!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.234
Let's get moving! Move! Move!

06:01.402 --> 06:04.112
Get off that chair,
you stupid bitch! Let's go!

06:05.114 --> 06:06.948
Get off the phone!
Put the phone down!

06:07.116 --> 06:09.284
You people move forward!
Move! Move! Move!

06:09.452 --> 06:10.494
Get out your phones!

06:10.661 --> 06:12.412
Get out your cell phones!
In the bag!

06:16.793 --> 06:19.127
That you don't wanna do.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.973
Shut the fuck up.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.435
Oh, y'all picked the wrong day
not to use the ATM.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.646
Get down.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.399
Do what you're told when you're told...

06:40.566 --> 06:42.484
...you may live.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.277
But I make no guarantees.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.286
- I'm in.
- You, up.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.831
- You, out.
- Let's go. Move.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.418
Your security system, you can
electronically seal off the entrances.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.670
Yes. Right away.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.506
Fabulous.
Oh, what a wonderful attitude.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.008
You and I are gonna
get along just fine.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.522
It's done.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.650
- We're locked down.
- Smashing.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.216
Gonna be late for work.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.863
Fire in the hole!

08:21.417 --> 08:24.544
- What do you think you're doing?
- Fucker set off the alarm.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.590
Don't you think it would have made
sense to shoot him before he set it off?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.425
Probably.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.678
Jesus. All right.
The alarm's been tripped.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.597
We're on a clock.
Let's get these people out of here.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.893
Next time, if you're gonna
do something, do it right.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.036
This is Detective Galloway.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.385
Gonna have to go back that way, sir.
Back that way.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.767
I want all points of entry
identified and covered.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.438
Nina, you need SWAT here now.
Have emergency crews standing by.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.982
Didn't take them long.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.900
Come on, man.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.197
- Set a perimeter. Move them back.
- How far?

09:34.365 --> 09:35.407
Portland.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.499
Detective Callo.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.510
Hey. Got him on the line.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.270
- We're on.
- This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.188
- Who am I speaking to?
- No questions.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.483
I'm in control of this facility now.
Complete control.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.153
Nobody gets in or out
without my say.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.363
I will execute
every man, woman and child...

10:15.531 --> 10:16.823
...if my needs are not met.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.409
All right, don't test me.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.287
- I'm a man of zero tolerance today.
- I'm listening.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.123
All right. Well, try not to
screw this up, huh, detective?

10:25.291 --> 10:29.002
I only have one demand,
and one demand only.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.356
Do you have a warrant?

10:49.523 --> 10:51.232
I need to speak to you, Quentin.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.861
That's where you're shit out of luck,
because I don't need to speak to you.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.404
It's important.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.539
Do you live in a barn?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.502
That's Detective Shane Dekker.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.046
Doesn't look like much of a detective.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.881
I could say the same about you.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.927
- Charming.
- Shane just transferred from Tacoma.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.763
- You might be interested to know-
- Save your breath.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.223
I really don't care.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.769
Just get to what's on your mind.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.398
We got a hostage situation
over at American Global...

11:31.565 --> 11:35.402
...and he won't talk
to anybody but you.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.197
- No shit?
- No shit.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.865
So we need you to do this.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.367
Why should I?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.869
Because people's lives are at risk.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.080
Yeah, like the kid said.

11:47.248 --> 11:51.501
Say I did wanna help, I'm suspended.
Or did that slip your mind?

11:51.669 --> 11:54.796
Well, as of right now,
you are back on the force.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.465
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

11:57.633 --> 12:02.011
I won't, however, unleash you alone.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.972
Always a catch.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.640
Shane here is your new partner.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.477
You can consider him
a younger version of me.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.523
How nice.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.485
- You'd have been with your partner-
- Ex-partner.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.073
On the unemployment
line long time ago.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.326
You know, for a moment,
I thought you cared.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.956
Where are you going?

12:55.191 --> 12:58.026
Yep. I'm here now.
I'll let you know.

13:04.992 --> 13:08.369
- Could we have a few words?
- Yeah. I'll give you two: Blow me.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.288
Need a follow-up comment,
let me know.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.126
- Terrific.
- Talked to him about 9:30.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.254
Nine-thirty. All right, 9:30. Okay.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.173
Teddy, Vincent, nice to see you both.

13:20.341 --> 13:25.678
Okay, so Conners has been reinstated
to full active duty, and it's his scene.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.056
Last time this guy headed
a hostage situation...

13:28.224 --> 13:29.557
...an innocent civilian died.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.601
I was not responsible.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.394
Well, you never are.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.232
That girl would be alive today
if it wasn't for your cowboy antics.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.441
You destroy lives.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.110
Well, look who's talking
about destroying lives.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.030
I seem to remember that's
your fucking specialty, Callo.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.740
Ladies, please.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.911
I was first on the scene,
and I have seniority.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.831
- Decision's been made, Bernie.
- Don't do this, Martin.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.791
Don't cave in to this guy.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.460
Bernie, I need you to take a hike.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.379
All right? We'll talk about it later.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.512
Fine.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.557
I'll watch the train wreck from home.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.225
Bye, Bernie.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.019
Okay, SWAT,
because of special circumstances...

14:15.187 --> 14:17.188
...we'll defer to Conners.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.357
He's in charge.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.943
First I heard SWAT defer to anyone.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.446
Now, I want you to do the folks
in the bank a big favor...

14:25.614 --> 14:28.950
...by proving me very wrong
about you, okay?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.619
Oh, that's an order.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.041
Anything questionable happens today,
I wanna know about it, okay?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.751
Yes, sir.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.047
Looks like you got yourself
a babysitter.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.444
We have approximately
four to seven heavily armed men...

15:04.612 --> 15:07.030
...holding an unspecified
number of customers...

15:07.197 --> 15:08.448
...and employees hostage.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.783
You're just a wealth of knowledge,
Vincent.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.620
Their only demand so far
has been to speak to you.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.165
Get me a line into the bank.
Let's see what they want.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.666
Okay.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.014
Well, well, well.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.100
If it isn't Detective Conners.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.352
Who am I speaking with?

15:37.519 --> 15:39.854
Well, for now, call me Lorenz.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.523
Okay, Lorenz. How we doing in there?

15:42.691 --> 15:45.109
Get you anything?
Food, medical supplies perhaps?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.445
We heard an explosion.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.156
Everyone who matters is fine.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.868
Of course, I would have preferred
the authorities not be involved at all...

15:54.036 --> 15:57.372
...but since Seattle's finest
needs a presence on the scene...

15:57.539 --> 15:59.207
...I'm glad it's you.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.377
- Oh, well. My fame precedes me.
- Don't be flattered.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.755
I needed to have someone who's been
through this experience before...

16:05.923 --> 16:11.803
...because, detective,
I plan on living a long, full, rich life.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.723
However, I am surprised
that they found you so quickly.

16:15.891 --> 16:19.268
- I thought you were suspended.
- I was.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.729
But I'm back. Your information's old.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.399
You never get what you pay for.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.069
Well, I guess you wanna know
about the hostages?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.445
Yes.

16:29.613 --> 16:34.242
There's approximately 40,
and they're doing just swell.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.536
Well, all of them except one.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.496
Someone's dead?

16:38.664 --> 16:43.501
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.880
You can't keep the hostages in check
if you let a bad deed go unpunished.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.842
They might just randomly revolt.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.387
Chaos has some order to it.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.098
What else will I be looking for?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.558
Demands.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.270
Wouldn't be too much to ask for you
and your colleagues just to bounce?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.855
Safe to say.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.608
All right. Well, you just stay
by the phone, and I'll- I'll contact you.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.609
- Hey, wait, Lorenz.
- Don't worry.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.780
I don't have any plans
until sunrise tomorrow.

17:12.948 --> 17:16.325
Relax. It's gonna be a long one.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.537
Hey, come on, Lorenz.
This conversation's not finished.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.665
Patience, detective. Patience.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.127
We don't want this to be another
Pearl Street Bridge, now, do we?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.053
He's out.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.223
This standoff
is reaching two hours now.

17:39.391 --> 17:43.061
We've been told detectives have
made contact with the perpetrators...

17:43.228 --> 17:46.355
...but whether specific demands
have been made, we cannot confirm.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.524
When we're in the know,
we'll let you know.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.819
I'm Karen Cross live
for Channel 2 news.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.384
Where's our fearless captain?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.678
He went uptown to brief
the commissioner.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.806
And you're here in his place.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.271
- What's that?
- Nicotine gum.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.566
- You quit smoking?
- Caffeine, too, if you must know.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.444
- What? A man's capable of change.
- Yeah.

18:33.612 --> 18:39.158
- Don't worry. I still have a vice or two.
- Detective, 15 rings. No answer.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.536
Try again in five.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.539
- What are they doing in there?
- Wasting our fucking time.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.170
Precisely.

18:51.338 --> 18:54.549
He knows police protocol, not to
mention the shit in our own precinct.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.050
He's disguising his voice.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.886
Probably means he's got a record
and has done this before.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.888
Dropped that hint about sunrise.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.057
He's buying time.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.269
- Why?
- He's trying to figure out his move.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.272
- He wasn't expecting us.
- He wasn't expecting you.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.232
He said he thought
you were suspended.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.735
Probably thought it'd take all day
to find me, giving him time he needs.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.572
- He's stalling.
- He almost has what he came for.

19:17.739 --> 19:18.865
We're going in.

19:21.243 --> 19:25.288
- Where is the SWAT commander?
- I'll find him.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.040
That's a big call.
You thought about what you're doing?

19:28.208 --> 19:32.879
- Are you questioning me, Teddy?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.381
Well, I question how you can fuck
that asshole...

19:35.549 --> 19:38.092
...and still manage
to look in the mirror.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.470
Look, the hostages
are in imminent danger.

19:41.638 --> 19:45.266
They've confessed to killing. That's
an automatic murder-one charge,

19:45.434 --> 19:47.435
Life sentence,
a needle for all of them.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.062
So why keep witnesses around
to testify?

19:50.230 --> 19:54.775
The longer we wait, the greater
the risk. We need to go in. Now.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.152
Quentin.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.574
- So, what we got?
- Snipers up top.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.451
Ten soldiers on the ground.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.037
- What's the best way in?
- Tear gas. Blow the doors.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.289
Hey, hold on. No explosives.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.000
We got 40 civilians in there.
It's too great a chance.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.501
Any other way?

20:12.669 --> 20:14.212
No. There's no pussy way in.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.089
The doors are locked electronically
from the inside...

20:17.257 --> 20:19.133
...and we ain't getting in
without force.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.804
What if we cut the power?
That'll disable the system.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.350
We can open the locks manually,
go in that way.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.477
That'll work.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.438
So we'll take the pussy way in,
commander.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.442
Cut the power
and we go in at 11:15 sharp.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.243
The banks are equipped with
generators. Once the power's down...

20:45.410 --> 20:48.704
...they'll kick back on
in approximately three to six minutes.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.623
Be over before then.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.085
- Commander, your men in position?
- Standing by.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.878
Call for the power to be cut.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.047
Once down, wait for my signal.

20:58.215 --> 21:02.134
Nobody moves until I give the go.
Understood?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.011
Yep.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.521
You, come here.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.814
Come here.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.692
Come on. Get up.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.695
No!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.826
Will you just shut the fuck up?

21:37.879 --> 21:41.048
Here they come.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.054
Stand still. I said don't move.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.686
Okay, let's go around the horn.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.731
- One, check.
- Two, check.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.859
- Three, check.
- Four, check.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.530
Here we go.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.324
Cut the power.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.369
What?

22:12.664 --> 22:13.998
Now.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.087
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
What just happened?

22:22.591 --> 22:24.467
Holy shit.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.932
Shit. Come on, guys.
Let's get a move on.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.061
- We're moving in.
- Stand the fuck down, commander.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.772
- It's a trap.
- No, you stand the fuck down.

22:37.939 --> 22:41.275
- This is my show now.
- Repeat, do not go in.

22:41.443 --> 22:45.988
On my count. Three, two, one.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.573
Move!

22:57.125 --> 22:58.292
Go!

23:32.619 --> 23:33.994
Round up all the hostages!

23:34.162 --> 23:37.331
Anyone that comes out, you grab
them! Every single one of them!

23:37.499 --> 23:39.333
Got the emergency crews over here.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.086
Secure the area.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.006
Medics! Paramedics here!

23:46.174 --> 23:48.634
Anyone in the bank!

25:13.595 --> 25:16.138
- You see anybody come your way?
- No. No one went by us.

25:16.306 --> 25:21.435
Detectives, we found these.
Gloves, masks, vests.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.360
We let them walk right past us.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.240
Fucking beautiful.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.051
Okay, we- We got the one teller dead.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.930
The two that were strung up, they're
alive, but they're in critical condition.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.475
Few of the SWAT took burns,
but that's the worst of it.

26:01.643 --> 26:05.354
Depending on who you talk to, there
was between five and nine perps.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.065
Nobody saw them, because
they were wearing their masks.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.359
I got Dax collecting
all the security tapes...

26:10.527 --> 26:13.946
...so that's at least gonna
give us a firm number.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.699
Want background checks
on every hostage.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.493
They're all suspects until they're not.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.662
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

26:21.830 --> 26:24.623
I need to hear that conversation
between Conners and Lorenz.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.500
- Well, you'll have to wait.
- How long?

26:26.668 --> 26:27.710
An hour, maybe more.

26:27.877 --> 26:30.170
Can you show me
how to play it myself?

26:30.338 --> 26:32.715
Now, look, it doesn't work this way,
okay?

26:32.882 --> 26:34.300
I don't take orders from you.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.927
I don't know you
and no one touches my stuff, okay?

26:37.095 --> 26:39.638
You'll have to wait. Excuse me.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.099
What the-?

26:42.267 --> 26:44.351
What the hell are you doing?
Are you ADD?

26:44.519 --> 26:47.688
Along with whatever they stole
and this war zone they left behind...

26:47.856 --> 26:50.107
...a man's dead
and the killers are running free.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.153
I don't have time to wait. I'll figure
it out myself. Thank you for your help.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.281
Okay, wait. No. Just- No, no, no.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.534
This is a dat recorder. You know what
that is? Digital audio-tape.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.662
It's just like a regular tape player,
right? Play, stop, rewind.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.207
The headphones jack straight in.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.585
Tape's already inside. All right?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.004
That wasn't so hard, was it?

27:14.382 --> 27:17.176
Just don't break anything, okay?

27:35.528 --> 27:40.324
So everyone's been cleared out
at this point except for those two there.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.575
What about this one?

27:41.743 --> 27:44.828
That's a camera in the vault.
It got blown in the first explosion.

27:44.996 --> 27:48.832
And here comes...

27:50.251 --> 27:51.669
That's when you cut the power.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.837
So we can't ID them.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.924
There's a four minute, 52-second gap
before the image returns.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.884
Yeah. They're long gone by then.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.262
Go to the tapes when they went in.
Document each move made...

28:02.430 --> 28:04.264
...for the two hours they were inside.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.393
Oh, hey. Awful lot of news cameras
outside.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.270
Maybe one got a good look
at them coming out.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.189
Have Vincent check it out.

28:12.982 --> 28:16.193
Conners, better come out here.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.448
Oh, shit.

28:21.616 --> 28:22.908
Feds.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.370
Detective Conners.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.955
Join us, would you?

28:28.123 --> 28:29.289
Someone's dead?

28:29.457 --> 28:33.669
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.130
You can't expect
to keep the hostages in check...

28:36.297 --> 28:38.132
...if you let a bad deed
go unpunished.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.135
They might just randomly revolt.

28:41.302 --> 28:44.138
Chaos has some order to it.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.604
Prince Amar Al-Aban is one of the
wealthiest and least popular Arabs...

28:52.772 --> 28:57.192
...in the Middle East. There's been
threats, but for better or worse...

28:57.360 --> 28:59.153
...he's an ally to the United States.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.196
Last month in Charlotte,
North Carolina...

29:01.364 --> 29:03.157
...the Crown Valley Bank was hit.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.200
Prince had a safe-deposit box
there too.

29:05.368 --> 29:08.078
- So, what was in the box?
- We don't keep records.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.913
Boxes are private.

29:10.081 --> 29:13.500
Since 9/11, we screen for
live tissue, viruses and explosives.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.627
If it passes those tests, we don't ask.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.547
Look, this is fascinating shit.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.174
What about the money?

29:20.341 --> 29:22.426
Bank robbers still like cash,
don't they?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.803
Cash drawers don't appear
to be touched.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.263
Neither does the cash vault.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.849
So they broke into a bank
and didn't steal any money?

29:29.017 --> 29:32.478
We believe the prince's box was the
target. We're trying to reach him now.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.980
Sir, may I have a word with you,
please?

29:35.148 --> 29:37.316
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.784
I'm curious.

29:46.951 --> 29:52.207
Are you familiar with the term
"franchise-sized fuckup"?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.793
What, this is my fault, huh?

29:56.294 --> 29:59.546
I'm beginning to understand why
they wanted to deal directly with you.

29:59.714 --> 30:04.468
You think you're smart, Quentin,
but, man, are you stupid.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.595
- You got played.
- Oh, that's not fair.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.306
Everything was according
to standard procedure.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.391
You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.478
The commissioner's office
is scrambling to make sense of this.

30:14.646 --> 30:19.733
If they need a scapegoat,
I got zero problem serving you up.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.026
Thought so.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.111
You wanted this to happen.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.906
Good God, I did not.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.619
If it had to be somebody...

30:32.872 --> 30:37.000
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.419
You can't expect
to keep the hostages in check...

30:39.587 --> 30:41.421
...if you let a bad deed
go unpunished.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.466
They might just randomly revolt.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.762
Chaos has some order to it.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.030
I think this Lorenz was
trying to tell us something.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.867
Oh, really? You don't say.

31:10.034 --> 31:14.454
The way he spoke.
He paused before certain words.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.874
Have you ever heard
of the chaos theory?

31:17.041 --> 31:20.669
Edward Lorenz invented
the chaos theory in the 1960s.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.130
It's the study of phenomena
that appear random...

31:23.298 --> 31:25.132
...but have an element of regularity...

31:25.300 --> 31:27.384
...which can be described
mathematically.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.969
Try that again.

31:29.137 --> 31:33.807
Pretty much, initial state of events
may seem unrelated and random...

31:33.975 --> 31:35.767
...but eventually a pattern emerges...

31:35.935 --> 31:38.812
...and in the end,
all the pieces fit together.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.814
Anything else, officers?

31:40.982 --> 31:43.358
No, that'll be all. Thanks.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.445
So you're a college boy.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.696
Which one?

31:47.864 --> 31:49.156
Someplace I've heard of...

31:49.324 --> 31:53.160
...or one of those inbred
state schools no one's heard of?

31:53.328 --> 31:54.328
U. Dub.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.247
So it's the latter.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.541
How'd you end up on the force?

31:59.709 --> 32:01.543
It's kind of the family business.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.962
Oh, your dad's dad and so on back?

32:04.130 --> 32:06.924
Listen, do we really need
all this "get to know you" crap?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.092
Couple of hours ago,
you didn't give a shit.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.677
You've grown on me.

32:10.845 --> 32:14.306
Besides, I'm entrusting my life to you.
I should know something about you.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.808
I would think you'd like to know
a little about me.

32:16.976 --> 32:19.728
I know about you, detective.
Everyone does.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.272
You don't say that
with much enthusiasm.

32:22.732 --> 32:26.234
Not much to be enthusiastic about.

32:26.819 --> 32:29.029
Listen, my reputation
often precedes me.

32:29.197 --> 32:34.159
You, however, have no reputation
at all, a fact I need to deal with.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.663
If you've been through the shit I have,
then you can judge me.

32:37.830 --> 32:41.291
Now, we can try to work together
and make the best of a bad situation...

32:41.459 --> 32:44.544
...or we can compare
dick sizes all day.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.046
It's up to you.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.884
Since this is your first day here,
today, mine's bigger.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.638
Conners, come in.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.349
Go ahead.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.143
I got something
you're gonna wanna see.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.565
Lastly, I don't like the Pac 10.

33:06.609 --> 33:07.985
It's overrated.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.752
Come over and see this.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.589
Detective. Just can't stay away
from me, can you?

33:29.757 --> 33:31.591
Can you roll, please?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.761
Yeah, Okay. Right there. Perfect.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.847
Damon Richards.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.433
Career loser. I busted him
a couple years ago...

33:39.600 --> 33:42.561
...on attempted robbery.
Stupid bastard never learns.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.563
What's he doing back on the streets?

33:44.731 --> 33:47.107
He gave up his partners
and cut a deal with the D.A.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.358
Got an address?

33:48.526 --> 33:51.403
The only thing on file's in Spokane,
but I think I remember...

33:51.571 --> 33:54.114
...that he had a girlfriend in town.
Gina, I think.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.247
Gina, it's the police. Open up.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.087
Step back. Now.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.828
Gun!

34:43.664 --> 34:46.583
Shots fired. Officer down.
We need an ambulance and backup.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.670
Oh, shit.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.964
Are you hit?

34:53.132 --> 34:54.341
I'm fine.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.703
I got her.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.914
I got her. Stop, Gina.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.124
Teddy!

35:27.291 --> 35:29.459
- You like that, huh?
- Yeah.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.781
I'm a police officer.

36:01.742 --> 36:04.369
That guy's a murder suspect.
I need your bike.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.745
What?

36:07.123 --> 36:09.916
Go ahead, dude. It's all yours, man.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.403
Look out!

37:19.153 --> 37:21.404
Son of a bitch.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.874
I want my fucking lawyer.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.542
Fuck your lawyer.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.536
He's unconscious but stable,
with a nice knot on his forehead.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.456
- Three officers are watching the room.
- He wakes, they call.

39:36.624 --> 39:40.335
Hey, Quincy, come on.
Give it a rest. I'm fine.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.796
Quincy was a coroner.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.715
You might be bruised,
but you may have a cracked rib.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.217
You should get to a hospital.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.302
Should do a lot of things.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.558
You sure you're all right?

39:55.726 --> 39:57.268
I'm fine.

39:57.812 --> 40:02.565
Gina Lopez, 28, done time
for possession, has two kids.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.775
Am I interrupting?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.487
No.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.239
Excuse me.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.283
Gina claims she doesn't know
anything about a bank robbery.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.077
Of course she doesn't.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.704
- Vincent.
- Yeah?

40:18.582 --> 40:19.833
Have them put Miss Lopez...

40:20.000 --> 40:22.293
...in interrogation one
and turn the AC on full.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.629
Let me know when her nipples
can cut glass.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.089
Sorry, detective. I didn't-

40:26.257 --> 40:28.591
When we first met,
I didn't realize who you were.

40:28.759 --> 40:32.846
I worked with your dad briefly
right after I got out of the academy.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.431
It was an honor.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.849
Thanks, Vincent.

40:36.016 --> 40:37.559
Father was Harry Dekker.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.853
Detectives, ready for you.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.528
Somebody going on a trip?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.822
Looks like it, don't it?

40:50.990 --> 40:52.866
You're looking well, Marnie.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.702
Heard you were back, Conners.
Keep dreaming.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.872
You, on the other hand:

40:59.039 --> 41:01.833
- Hi. Marnie.
- Shane.

41:02.001 --> 41:06.337
You know, I got a bike myself.
Maybe we can go for a ride.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.964
Or maybe I could just ride you.

41:10.384 --> 41:13.094
Can we get back to work now,
please?

41:14.054 --> 41:18.433
We have passport, suntan lotion,
Bermuda shorts, thong bikini-

41:18.601 --> 41:20.143
Hopefully hers.

41:20.311 --> 41:24.230
...and this.

41:27.902 --> 41:31.196
Must be 50 large, his cut.

41:31.363 --> 41:34.032
- You'd think, right?
- It's not?

41:34.200 --> 41:38.578
Well, don't put words in my mouth,
but two things jump out at me here.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.164
First of all, every bank
has their own money bands...

41:41.332 --> 41:43.082
...and these are not
American Global's.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.252
After checking, we find they belong
to World National Financial.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.214
- Sounds familiar.
- Months ago, half a million dollars...

41:49.381 --> 41:52.550
...was stolen in an armed robbery
there, smash-and-grab job.

41:52.718 --> 41:55.345
But they caught the guys.
They recovered about 400,000.

41:55.513 --> 41:59.641
Now, they've been in jail ever since
and their trials are still pending...

41:59.808 --> 42:03.937
...so that brings me
to point number two.

42:05.439 --> 42:07.023
Smell that.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.235
- What is that?
- When evidence comes in...

42:10.402 --> 42:13.071
...any physical contact
can make it hard to lift prints...

42:13.239 --> 42:14.614
...so now to mark the bills...

42:14.782 --> 42:17.116
...we spray a scented
solution directly on them.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.786
- Is that new?
- Yeah. Wave of the future.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.747
You try and keep up with the times,
eh, Conners?

42:22.915 --> 42:25.166
So this money's not from our bank.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.419
Oh, no. No, this money's from
the World National Financial job...

42:28.587 --> 42:30.255
...and our evidence room.

42:36.929 --> 42:40.139
For a list of things
you can put in my mouth.

42:40.307 --> 42:41.975
Conners.

42:47.481 --> 42:50.650
Do you remember who headed up
the World National case?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.820
I think it was Callo.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.154
Why?

42:55.322 --> 42:58.491
Oh, no reason.
Just thinking out loud. Come on.

43:02.329 --> 43:06.708
When you said it was your family
business, I didn't realize.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.377
Guess I just didn't connect the dots.

43:10.045 --> 43:12.463
Don't worry about it.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.841
Your father was a hero.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.428
Yes, he was.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.101
First I thought maybe you
were related to the captain.

43:27.021 --> 43:29.272
No. No relation.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.331
We found the money, Gina.

43:47.541 --> 43:49.042
The money was Damon's.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.419
That money came
from our evidence room.

43:51.587 --> 43:54.213
I told you, I know nothing
about a bank robbery.

43:54.381 --> 43:58.134
Whatever Damon was into,
I know nothing about.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.595
So where were you going?

44:00.763 --> 44:02.055
Vacation.

44:02.222 --> 44:04.932
This isn't possession
or solicitation, Gina.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.643
This is felony murder one.

44:06.810 --> 44:09.562
If you're protecting him,
you'd get life.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.147
I didn't do nothing.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.690
It's "I didn't do anything. "

44:12.858 --> 44:16.986
"Didn't do nothing" is a
double negative, infers the positive.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.572
The grammar
in this country's terrible.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.408
Look, this isn't going away.
You wanna walk out of here...

44:22.576 --> 44:25.161
...with some semblance of a life,
you tell me something.

44:25.329 --> 44:28.665
I'm done talking.
I want a lawyer now.

44:31.418 --> 44:33.711
Fine. Then it's two phone calls
I'll make.

44:33.879 --> 44:36.089
The first to the
public defender's office.

44:36.256 --> 44:38.257
The second will be
to children's services.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.094
What?

44:41.261 --> 44:44.180
Simple. You insist on a lawyer,
I'll take your kids.

44:44.348 --> 44:48.393
Wait. You can't take my kids
away from me.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.271
What do you care? You were ready
to fly the coop with shit-for-brains.

44:52.439 --> 44:54.482
Fuck you!
You can't treat me like this!

44:54.650 --> 44:55.817
I have rights, you know.

44:55.984 --> 44:57.819
You can't take my children
away from me!

44:57.986 --> 44:59.570
I can and I will.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.614
Just tell me what I wanna know.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.957
- Not exactly useful information.
- You believe her?

45:11.125 --> 45:14.419
I think for the first time in the
girl's life, she's telling the truth.

45:14.586 --> 45:17.004
Once she asked for a lawyer
anything she told us...

45:17.172 --> 45:19.298
...would have been inadmissible.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.802
Yeah? Who would've known?
Would've been her word against mine.

45:22.970 --> 45:26.139
And who do you think
the jury would have believed?

45:26.306 --> 45:29.434
Justice by any means,
even if you cross the line?

45:29.601 --> 45:32.228
The only line around here
is the blue line.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.981
You cross that one,
then you got problems.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.817
Ask Callo.
He knows what I'm talking about.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.195
Those serial numbers
Marnie faxed me...

45:41.363 --> 45:44.323
...according to our computers,
that money should be downstairs.

45:44.491 --> 45:46.659
Moving on to basketball...

45:46.827 --> 45:51.664
...Sonics defeated the Trailblazers
last night, 85 to 72.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.545
Buzz us in.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.593
Gotta sign first.

46:12.394 --> 46:15.062
Heard you were back.

46:15.230 --> 46:17.899
Kind of liked not having you around,
Conners.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.193
Have another doughnut, Harry.

46:31.246 --> 46:36.375
That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the
city's greatest source of contraband.

46:36.543 --> 46:38.628
Drugs, weapons, cash.

46:38.796 --> 46:42.507
Millions just sitting here for the taking.

46:42.674 --> 46:45.051
Yeah, but you'd have to have
some major firepower...

46:45.219 --> 46:49.555
...not to mention an extra-large set of
balls to knock off the police station.

46:49.723 --> 46:52.058
Not if you're a cop.

46:52.226 --> 46:56.729
Could just walk right in and...

46:58.315 --> 47:00.233
...take whatever you want.

47:04.780 --> 47:09.200
Here it is. Line 17.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.077
Bernie Callo.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.080
No one takes anything out
of here unless they sign for it.

47:14.248 --> 47:16.082
So, what?
He showed you a warrant, what?

47:16.250 --> 47:17.750
He must've.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.001
He must've.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.045
What, lost your fucking memory,
Harry?

47:21.213 --> 47:24.757
You know how many times someone
signs shit out? I see the same guys.

47:24.925 --> 47:27.593
I can't remember one instance
from two weeks ago.

47:27.761 --> 47:30.763
If that's his signature,
that means he signed for it.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.431
Take it up with him.

47:34.309 --> 47:37.687
The money from Richards' place
traced to the World National heist...

47:37.855 --> 47:39.564
...a case Callo headed up.

47:39.731 --> 47:42.942
Bernie signed the money out
of evidence himself two weeks ago.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.193
How much?

47:44.361 --> 47:46.654
Four hundred and thirty-three
thousand dollars...

47:46.822 --> 47:49.824
If it is Callo, it would explain
how they knew police protocol...

47:49.992 --> 47:51.701
...and how our department operates.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.786
Explains why he was
pissed this morning...

47:53.954 --> 47:55.580
...about being replaced by Conners.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.915
He doesn't need another
reason to be pissed.

47:58.083 --> 48:00.459
What about motive?

48:00.627 --> 48:02.753
- Do we have one?
- Pressure.

48:02.921 --> 48:04.422
Could have been getting to him.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.841
He's been getting a big cold shoulder
from cops...

48:07.009 --> 48:08.926
...since he testified about Pearl Street.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.637
No. I don't buy that.

48:12.931 --> 48:15.641
He was also getting divorced.

48:17.686 --> 48:20.771
About a month ago, he told me
he and his wife might be splitting...

48:20.939 --> 48:23.774
...asked if I knew a lawyer
who wouldn't clean him out.

48:23.942 --> 48:26.152
I didn't think it was this serious.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.195
I don't know. Bernie's a first-rate cop.

48:28.363 --> 48:30.156
He was a boy scout, for chrissake.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.450
This just doesn't
make any sense, guys.

48:32.618 --> 48:34.535
They never do, captain.

48:34.703 --> 48:37.330
Come on.
The facts speak for themselves.

48:37.497 --> 48:39.457
No, they don't.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.459
Why, if Callo's involved-?

48:41.627 --> 48:44.337
Why didn't they ask
for him at the bank?

48:48.050 --> 48:50.176
Jenkins.

49:01.021 --> 49:04.231
And you arrived home at what time?

49:04.399 --> 49:08.152
Mrs. Callo, do you feel okay
to continue?

49:08.320 --> 49:09.946
Yes, I'm fine.

49:11.281 --> 49:13.115
Just a few more minutes.

49:17.829 --> 49:21.082
Wife came home approximately
45 minutes ago, found him here.

49:21.249 --> 49:23.209
None of the neighbors
heard anything.

49:23.377 --> 49:24.710
There was no forced entry...

49:24.878 --> 49:27.171
...and no one saw anyone
else fleeing the scene.

49:28.090 --> 49:32.051
Guys, blueprints from the bank.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.261
There's pictures, schematics.

49:34.429 --> 49:37.807
There's at least a dozen Internet
articles on the Saudi prince.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.643
So that's it.

49:46.775 --> 49:49.735
You've reached the Callo residence.
No one can get to the phone.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.029
Please leave a message.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.365
Detective Conners.

49:57.035 --> 49:59.578
Are you starting
to connect the dots?

49:59.746 --> 50:02.039
Putting all the pieces together?

50:05.252 --> 50:07.545
Is the pattern starting to emerge?

50:10.674 --> 50:12.925
They wouldn't punish you...

50:13.760 --> 50:15.094
...but I will.

50:17.472 --> 50:20.182
Vengeance will be mine, detective.

50:21.101 --> 50:23.019
Then come and get me,
you piece of shit.

50:49.629 --> 50:52.298
What they told Callo was the plan
and what the plan was...

50:52.466 --> 50:54.300
...must have been
two different things.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.470
Obviously this wasn't part
of a plan Callo would've agreed with.

50:57.637 --> 50:59.472
You'd think a cop would be smarter.

50:59.639 --> 51:01.265
Come on.
As cops, we come across...

51:01.433 --> 51:05.644
...every temptation in the book.
Money, drugs, power.

51:05.812 --> 51:09.940
We all like to think we can resist
any urge, but we're not saints.

51:10.108 --> 51:13.319
So Callo was involved,
and now they're dragging you into it.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.489
- Why?
- Man said he wanted vengeance.

51:17.657 --> 51:19.325
Piss anyone off lately?

51:20.702 --> 51:21.827
Me?

51:21.995 --> 51:24.663
So I just got off the phone
with Agent Doyle...

51:24.831 --> 51:27.249
...and apparently after
the Charlotte break-in...

51:27.417 --> 51:30.294
...the prince withdrew
all his possessions...

51:30.462 --> 51:33.339
...from every safe-deposit box
in the country.

51:34.341 --> 51:35.966
- They didn't touch the cash.
- No.

51:36.134 --> 51:38.260
- Or the safe-deposit boxes.
- Nope.

51:38.428 --> 51:43.849
So they break into a bank,
blow it up, and steal nothing?

51:44.017 --> 51:45.351
Still make sense to you?

51:45.519 --> 51:47.853
Nothing about today makes sense.

51:48.021 --> 51:49.522
Excuse me.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.791
Return to the earth now...

52:08.959 --> 52:12.628
...if your mind is troubled
and your heart is uncertain...

52:12.796 --> 52:17.383
...for it is by returning to the beginning
that we can clearly see the path.

52:18.218 --> 52:19.844
He's your find.

52:21.263 --> 52:25.391
Detective, wanna say that again?

52:25.559 --> 52:28.185
We go back to where this all started.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.812
We go back to the bank.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.702
The tapes are confirming five bad
guys, but since the vault cam blew...

52:44.870 --> 52:47.705
...what they did in there
is a total mystery.

52:47.873 --> 52:50.583
I've been through these tapes
20 times. I'm telling you-

52:50.750 --> 52:52.251
Shut up, Dax.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.732
Wait. Hold on a second.
Do you see that?

53:14.900 --> 53:17.776
- See what?
- Go back a little.

53:17.944 --> 53:20.362
- What?
- Look closely at the camera angles.

53:20.530 --> 53:22.865
They're all fixed, right?
They don't rotate or pan.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.241
Okay, play it.

53:24.409 --> 53:27.286
Now, Camera 8 dominates our
attention because of the explosion.

53:27.454 --> 53:29.788
But while that's happening,
check out Camera 2.
