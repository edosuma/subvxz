[Galloping Hooves]

02:07.211 --> 02:09.669
- A little late, Dutchy.
- Ain't it so? Sener.

02:09.755 --> 02:10.922
[Man]
Buddy.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.256
Mornin'.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.218
- Wow. Looks great.
- Hi, Mr. Roedel.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.350
[Preacher]
Giver of all spiritual grace...

02:22.434 --> 02:25.478
the author of everlasting life,
send thy blessings...

02:25.562 --> 02:27.939
upon these, thy servants -

02:28.023 --> 02:31.901
this man and this woman
whom we bless in thy name -

02:31.985 --> 02:35.321
that as Isaac and Rebekah
lived faithfully together...

02:35.405 --> 02:38.491
so these persons may surely
perform and keep...

02:38.575 --> 02:41.619
the vow and covenant
between them made.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.748
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here -

02:45.833 --> 02:47.792
What's ticklin' you?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.544
Do you smell somethin' funny?

02:49.628 --> 02:53.589
Fool. It's the cologne my ma
slapped on me this mornin'.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.718
- [Chuckles]
...signifying unto us the mystical union -

02:57.803 --> 03:01.264
What brings you so late
to Sister's funer -

03:01.348 --> 03:05.017
- I mean wedding.
- My pa had me workin'.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.728
- Huh.
- [Man] Son.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.858
[Preacher] Let him speak now
or else forever hold his peace.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.860
## [Fiddle]

03:13.944 --> 03:16.696
- Whoo!
- ## [Clapping Rhythmically]

03:51.315 --> 03:55.067
[Chattering]

04:00.616 --> 04:03.409
Do you believe all those men
are necessary, Horton?

04:05.370 --> 04:08.039
We can take no further chances, Asa.

04:08.123 --> 04:12.585
You and I both know it'll soon be war
between us and the Yankee aggressors.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.630
With that black republican
Abe Lincoln in the White House...

04:15.714 --> 04:18.132
Missouri's no longer safe
from the depredations...

04:18.216 --> 04:20.551
of Jennison and his Kansas Jayhawkers.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.137
They've yet to strike
this deep into Missouri, Horton.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.557
Lawrence, Kansas, and its abolitionists
are a long way from here.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.769
There are Union men
even here amongst us, Asa.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.230
Schmitz and his Germans
form a militia at Independence...

04:33.315 --> 04:36.359
and his Lawrence cohorts
have eyes and ears amongst us.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.985
Even here.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.572
If you refer to us Bowdens, Lee,
you are sorely mistaken.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.369
We may be Union men, yes.
But we are Southerners too.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.121
Now, you know very well
we'll have no hand in jayhawking...

04:49.206 --> 04:51.457
or abolitionist provocations.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.587
- I did not imply it, sir.
- I believe, sir, you did.

04:59.174 --> 05:04.387
Now, gentlemen, my home is no place,
and this is no time for political quarrels.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.224
We are all old friends here.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.437
Asa Chiles, you have spoken truly.
My apologies, Horton.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.439
[Horton]
Well said, sir.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.944
[Chattering]

05:28.704 --> 05:30.204
Horton.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.291
- [Woman] Bye.
- [Man] Take care now.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.255
I've been thinking, Jack Bull.
A wedding is a peculiar thing.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.883
- It's no more peculiar, Jake, than slavery.
- That's certain.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.469
That's why I've often wondered
for what cause those Northerners...

05:45.554 --> 05:47.888
are so anxious to change
our Southern institutions.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.932
- Hmm.
- From both North and South...

05:50.017 --> 05:53.644
men are every day enslaved at the altar,
regardless of their state or color.

05:53.729 --> 05:57.189
Well, there's a type of subjugation.
We shall avoid it, Jake.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.484
Happily my poverty ensures
my freedom from such a fate.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.238
Oh, no.
Not if my mother can help it.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.825
I heard her singin' your praises earlier
to the sister of the groom.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.629
- Good day, Mrs. Chiles. Sir.
- Father.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.799
Please give our regards to your father, Jake.
You know he's always invited.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.801
He's more comfortable workin'.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.721
You must at the least bring Mr. Roedel
some of the cake.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.015
I will, ma'am.
Thank you.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.529
[Machine Whirring]

06:47.449 --> 06:49.366
Guten Abend.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.953
- Guten Abend, Herr Meyer.
- Guten Abend, Ja.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.372
- Guten Abend.
- Guten Abend.

06:59.336 --> 07:03.547
Father, Mrs. Chiles sends her regards.
A piece of the cake.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.636
You are to see tomorrow Mrs. Kreuzer.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.555
The war - it is sure to come now,
with the secession.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.892
Mrs. Kreuzer's husband
will take you in Saint Louis.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.190
Pa, I told you. I'm not gonna huddle with all
the other Lincoln-lovin' Germans in Saint Louis.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.485
It is safer.
For us, this is no war.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.154
Pa, you may have borne me in Germany,
but I was raised here.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.366
- These are my people. And if it gets hot -
- Your people?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.077
No, Jacob, this they are not.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.872
You will always be a Deutschman,
a German to them...

07:36.957 --> 07:38.958
no matter with who you are friends.

07:40.710 --> 07:44.213
Promise me you'll go to Mrs. Kreuzer.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.101
[Low Rumbling]

08:05.110 --> 08:09.697
- [Galloping Hooves]
- [Men Whooping, Shouting]

08:21.459 --> 08:25.212
[Men Shouting]

08:26.798 --> 08:30.426
[Man]
All right, come on! Get 'em all out!

08:30.510 --> 08:32.678
[Horse Whinnying]

08:32.761 --> 08:34.972
[Shouting Continues]

08:35.056 --> 08:38.517
[Man]
Where is he? Where is he?

08:38.602 --> 08:40.769
[Whinnying]

08:40.854 --> 08:43.731
[Man]
I got him! I got him!

08:43.815 --> 08:45.733
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Mrs. Chiles] Oh, no!

08:45.817 --> 08:47.985
[Mrs. Chiles Screams]

08:48.069 --> 08:52.239
- Where's your boy, Asa?
- My son's gone.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.825
- Where's your boy?
- [Gasps]

08:54.910 --> 08:58.037
- Jake.
- Jack Bull.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.581
He told me to run, Jake.
He told me.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.583
Did you see who they are?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.461
Jayhawkers, Jake. Lawrence men.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.715
- [Mrs. Chiles Screaming]
- [Gunshot]

09:09.799 --> 09:11.425
Father!

09:11.509 --> 09:14.011
Come on!
Don't you die here too.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.557
- Find the boy.
- Let's go look in the mill.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.684
[Whooping, Shouting Continue]

09:20.769 --> 09:24.188
- You men find the boy!
- [Gasping, Crying]

09:24.272 --> 09:26.774
[Horse Whinnies]

09:27.776 --> 09:30.653
[Sobbing]
Asa!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.906
Oh, my God!

09:40.080 --> 09:42.373
[Chattering]

09:54.177 --> 09:57.263
Ted? Riders.

10:08.483 --> 10:13.153
Gentlemen.
Captain Henderson, Company D.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.114
You boys have rid
a bit far from home.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.784
Hell, spent two nights
trackin' this bushwhacking bastard...

10:18.868 --> 10:21.996
and his Confederate friends
through the Sni-A-Bar.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.416
What are you boys doin'
this far into Missouri?

10:25.500 --> 10:29.169
Just rootin' out rebels
and conscriptin' chickens.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.172
Been through all Cass
and Lafayette Counties.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.216
Killed our share.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.015
[Man]
Not much action in Lafayette.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.641
We got four Sunday last.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.561
Stretched their necks.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.980
- They're still hanging.
- [Chuckles]

10:48.064 --> 10:50.649
Hey, George.
Fetch that busthead out there.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.490
- So you men were in on Lafayette?
- Yes, sir.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.618
[Sighs]

11:01.703 --> 11:04.705
But we're tirin' of
chasin' these rebs into the bush.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.791
Can't trust none of these locals.
They're all hidin' 'em.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.835
I wish we had a real army to fight.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.213
Not these sneakin' bastards.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.550
Battles and armies -
it's all back East.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.887
Down here in Missouri,
you just have the people to fight ya.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.930
Ted.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.559
Ted!

11:25.643 --> 11:27.978
- So you were in on Lafayette, huh?
- [Grunts]

11:28.063 --> 11:30.314
- [Woman Screams]
- [Man] Bushwhackers!

11:37.989 --> 11:40.032
[Woman Screaming]

11:47.290 --> 11:49.708
Whoo!

11:49.793 --> 11:52.628
[Woman Sobbing]

11:53.671 --> 11:55.923
Doin' business with
the Yankee invaders, huh?

11:56.007 --> 11:58.509
No. They forced me.
[Grunts]

11:58.593 --> 12:00.386
[Woman Screams]

12:05.183 --> 12:08.185
[Woman Crying]
He's dead.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.189
You killed him.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.192
Shoot me too, please.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.153
We don't hurt women, ma'am.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.531
[Sobbing]

12:27.247 --> 12:29.998
We took her man.
We should leave her the store.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.088
Come on, Jake.
It's gettin' hot in here.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.216
Enough of this, boys.
Let's load up!

12:43.471 --> 12:46.557
- Hyah! Hyah!
- [Braying]

13:27.140 --> 13:29.183
Black John.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.185
[Chuckles]

13:31.269 --> 13:33.729
- George Clyde.
- [Man] Whoa!

13:33.813 --> 13:35.689
Yep.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.066
Well met, my man. Well met.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.489
Hey, boy. Watch that man.
He's a cheat.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.158
Jack Bull.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.252
You boys will love riding with George Clyde.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.882
Makes Yankee killin' as entertaining
a pastime as greasin' ganders.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.969
- Who's guns are those?
- Even Holt over there.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.765
You'll get used to him.
That's Holt.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.934
That's George Clyde's pet nigger.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.312
Don't call him that in front of George though.
George don't like that.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.689
- He carries those?
- Yep.

14:17.774 --> 14:23.570
He's a damn fine scout.
George tosses him a gun a good Yankee kill or two.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.240
You know,
him and Clyde growed up together.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.409
When Jim Lane's boys come for Clyde,
Holt there sent three of them to heaven.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.411
So he rides with us now.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.289
'Cause them Yankees
want to kill him real bad.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.626
Yeah. Well, a nigger with guns
is still a nervous thing to me.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.337
[Chuckles]

14:51.599 --> 14:54.518
We're lookin' for the Dorr's place, ma'am.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.021
It's just up the road.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.023
Who are you?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.653
Why, we are Southern men,
and hungry.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.241
You don't look like Southern men.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.243
How do I know?

15:11.327 --> 15:16.290
Woman, my name is Crawford.
One of the Six Point Creek Crawfords.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.792
Do you know me?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.919
I knew the father.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.716
Well, come on.
Eat as what we have.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.218
[Sniffs]

15:28.303 --> 15:30.220
Whoo.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.644
Ma'am.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.732
- You alone here?
- Yes.

15:43.568 --> 15:48.614
Well, no. My man's at Arkansas
with Shelby.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.910
My son's in the barn.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.746
Is he grown?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.539
He was.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.584
Gave up a leg at Wilson's Creek.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.672
I keep him hid away.
Union Jayhawkers would kill him.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.758
He should ride with us.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.385
Oh, no. He won't fight.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.888
He's done with that.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.775
Hello inside.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
Show yourself, Clark. We're friends.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.952
[Man Chuckling]

16:40.083 --> 16:43.794
Bushwhackers. I could have killed you both.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.506
But it ain't even loaded.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.761
Not no need of that.
We're friends.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.932
Oh, you suppose so, do you?
I don't.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.560
You were at Wilson's Creek.
Who with?

17:00.645 --> 17:03.063
Why, with General Price.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.816
The fat glory-hound rebel himself.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.490
Didn't see that one comin', huh?

17:13.574 --> 17:17.160
[Chuckles]
Oh, I saw it comin'.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.957
I saw it rollin' past the little piles
of meat and bone which I once called my friends.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.959
I watched it roll right up to me.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.170
If you saw it comin',
couldn't you have dodged it?

17:28.464 --> 17:32.175
Well, nature bore me smart.
That changes things.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.429
I wanted my foot broke
so's I could head home.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.057
- [Chuckles]
- Damn little cannonball was rollin' slower
than a fevered rabbit.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.311
- You are a fool. Cannonball will rip your leg -
- [Laughing]

17:47.859 --> 17:50.569
Well, General Price is a good man.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.696
Why don't you have us
fetch you something to eat.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.199
I have a mother for that.

17:56.284 --> 18:00.203
I don't eat anyway.
Tryin' something different.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.914
You'll be killed anyways.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.042
Jayhawkers or militias -
someone or the other - stop here and kill you.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.838
Oh, they already been here.
Burned the barn.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.258
I wouldn't even move to put it out.
Ma done it.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.261
Likely you boys will kill me now.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.930
I don't much care.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.521
- [Clicks]
- You wanna die?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.899
Perhaps you choose to die now.

18:29.901 --> 18:34.196
I have some experience in the killing line, Clark.
I could do you a fair job of it this minute.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.703
No.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.915
No, Ma has her heart set on me livin'.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.751
You sure of that?
I'm here now loaded.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
I don't believe so.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.305
Your mother's a fine enough woman.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.933
You could help her out some,
don't you think?

19:03.017 --> 19:05.685
Get yourself a stick to lean on,
walk around a bit.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.357
Mm-hmm.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.944
That could be next.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.364
That could be the very next thing.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.911
[Chattering]

19:34.006 --> 19:35.966
You're an interestin' foreigner, Jake.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.388
Why is that?

19:41.472 --> 19:44.516
I hear your pa's a Dutchman.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.603
But you're loyal to here, not the North.
It's uncommon.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.689
Nah, Jake may have
been born a Dutchman...

19:50.773 --> 19:53.233
but my ma and pa
practically raised him.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.402
He's as Southern as they come.

Where's the other one, you devil?

20:31.606 --> 20:34.357
Speak up now,
and maybe you'll live.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.360
I'm alone.

20:37.445 --> 20:41.031
That's my daddy's horse.
He was shot off it three days back.

20:41.115 --> 20:45.118
He's lyin'. Let's parole him to Jesus,
and right now.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.538

- [Clyde] Hold your fire, boys!

21:45.930 --> 21:49.641
I said, cease fire, goddamn it!

21:49.725 --> 21:52.394
Control your fire!
[Panting]

21:52.478 --> 21:54.354

21:54.438 --> 21:56.564
There's women in here!

21:56.649 --> 21:59.025
[Man]
You know we don't kill women!

21:59.110 --> 22:01.903
Send 'em out now,
and they'll be safe passaged!

22:01.988 --> 22:04.406
Please, ma'am,
you and your daughter got to go.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.033
- Come on. Come on.
- We are goin', son.

22:07.118 --> 22:10.745

- Ray!

- You gotta trust me.
- We can't hold 'em from here!

23:02.715 --> 23:06.051
Get back, Lewis!
We'll kill them yet!

23:06.135 --> 23:08.595
We'll just have to take
our chances running!

23:08.679 --> 23:13.016
They'll riddle us down! There ain't
so much as a stump out there for cover!

23:14.393 --> 23:17.896
- [Man] Whoo!
- Come on, men! Let's go to it!

Hyah!

- Black John. With him alive.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.363
With Black John? Alive?

26:14.490 --> 26:18.368
Whoo! That was sure enough hot!
They left us hurtin', that's certain.

This way, boys.

- [Jack Bull] Taylor. You're alive.
- [Man] Jake Roedel.

27:18.804 --> 27:22.807
Well, Alf Bowden.
You sure are in a fix.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.018
Seems so.
Surely does seem so.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.812
- Do you know this man?
- Certainly.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.690
His daddy's place is just downriver
from the Chiles'.

- Jack Bull.
- Alf Bowden.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.410
- News of home?
- No, no, no. It all just goes on.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.288
Some may have died,
not most.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.665
What of my mother?

27:48.876 --> 27:51.711
Well, now -
Well, she is watched.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.755
All the secesh are watched.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.174
And my father?

27:56.258 --> 27:58.676
He comes and goes.
He's a Union man.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.804
He ain't bothered by no one.
You must know that.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.808
You must know the whole town
talks about you boys out here black-flaggin' it.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.937
Some friendliness
may be lost for your kin.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.150
You been fed?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.945
Not so as you'd notice.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.490
I'll look into it.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.910
[Black John]
Roedel.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.291
Now, take this down.
Itis forthe Lexington Union News.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.127
So do it fine, the way you do.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.046
Gladly.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.007
"Dear Citizens:

28:38.092 --> 28:41.928
"Mistakes are most common these days
and deadly for it.

28:42.012 --> 28:45.723
"The Federals are to hang William Lloyd
and James Curtain...

28:45.808 --> 28:48.768
"two fine sons of Missouri.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.062
'But by a provident cut of the cards...

28:51.146 --> 28:53.398
"four Federals have been dealt to me.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.110
"And it is their hope
that Lloyd and Curtain are not hanged...

28:57.194 --> 29:00.613
'as they would provide
the sequel to these murders.

29:02.616 --> 29:05.535
"However, if our boys are released...

29:05.619 --> 29:08.496
"I will, as a gentlemen...

29:08.580 --> 29:10.665
"release these unfortunates.

29:12.209 --> 29:16.212
"The choice is yours, citizens,
so make it wisely.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.424
"Signed, John Ambrose and George Clyde...

29:19.508 --> 29:22.135
Command of First Irregulars."

29:22.219 --> 29:26.013
That's good.
Put a note on it that says...

29:26.098 --> 29:29.392
"Where you think we ain't, we are.
Remember it."

29:33.814 --> 29:38.025
Who will deliver it?
There are Federals all over Lexington.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.070
We could slip a man in there.
We done it before.

29:41.155 --> 29:46.576
Oh, I reckon a citizen could be pressed into service,
if one could be found.

29:47.661 --> 29:51.080
That might be a job,
for citizens are cautious hereabouts.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.332
You got some better idea, Dutchy?

29:53.417 --> 29:55.751
Maybe you should volunteer yourself.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.089
Well, there is a way we could
prove more things than one.

30:00.174 --> 30:03.050
If we send a prisoner,
it would prove we have prisoners.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.345
And also
he can attest to our intentions.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.891
It seems to me he could get
more quickly into town as well.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.684
And time is short.

30:11.768 --> 30:15.563
Lloyd and Curtain will be hanged
right quick, I would think.

30:22.196 --> 30:25.615
It is a good idea.
There are some fine touches to it.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.825
You know, you should
speak up more, Roedel.

30:27.910 --> 30:30.578
You're not near so dumb
as you let on.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
Aw.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.917
Now go put one of them Federals
on a horse with that letter.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.671
Convince them to see
this deal through, Alf.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.091
We're only askin' to be treated
like the soldiers that we are.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.844
We shall do the same
for your companions here.

30:46.929 --> 30:49.472
Do your best.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.854
Huh.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.443
What are you lookin' at?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.291
[Sighs]
What is it, Jake?

31:18.835 --> 31:21.754
I hear you ruminatin' louder
than a cow chewin' in my ear...

31:21.838 --> 31:24.507
and it's keepin' me from my sleep.

31:25.676 --> 31:29.595
Do you think Alf Bowden's
made it back to Lexington as yet?

31:30.681 --> 31:33.849
There was a minute there
when I saw him ridin' off -

31:34.851 --> 31:37.395
I thought maybe
you and me could join him.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.439
That we could all ride home together.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.526
Just ride back home.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.823
What have you left at home
you're so anxious to ride back to?

31:50.284 --> 31:52.285
Nothin'.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.246
Just a passel of memories.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.540
Mostly memories of you and me.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.544
Of your father, old Asa Chiles.

32:05.674 --> 32:08.467
We'll stick together, Jack Bull.
We'll get all of it back.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.636
Huh.

32:10.721 --> 32:14.181
Then you're a black magician
who can raise the dead, are ya?

32:17.394 --> 32:21.647
No. My father's under the dirt to stay.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.192
Like that's gone to stay too.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.446
- My finger?
- Mm-hmm.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.656
Well, so it is.

32:30.741 --> 32:34.160
And it makes me notable
by the loss.

32:34.244 --> 32:38.789
You sound pleased, as if that finger
had been pesterin' you for rings.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.335
No. It was a fine finger,
and I'd rather have it still.

32:42.419 --> 32:47.340
But it was took from me,
and it's been et by chickens for sure.

32:49.051 --> 32:52.928
And I say,
what is the good side to this amputation?

32:53.013 --> 32:56.098
- And there is one.
- Name it, Jake.

32:56.183 --> 32:59.685
Well, you say one day some Federals...

32:59.770 --> 33:02.563
catch up to me
and kill me in a thicket.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.482
Well, they would riddle me
and hang me...

33:04.566 --> 33:06.734
and no Southern man
would find me for weeks or months.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.738
And when they did, I'd be bad meat,
pretty well rotted to a glob.

33:10.822 --> 33:14.575
[Sighs]
You're scientifically accurate, I'm afraid.

33:14.660 --> 33:19.830
- I've seen it.
- I'd be a mysterious gob of rot.

33:19.915 --> 33:23.918
People would say,
"who was that?"

33:24.002 --> 33:26.003
And surely someone
would look up and say...

33:26.088 --> 33:29.423
"Why, it's nubbin-fingered Jake Roedel."

33:29.508 --> 33:32.385
And then you could go
and tell my father I was clearly murdered...

33:32.469 --> 33:35.805
and he wouldn't be tortured
by uncertain wonders.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.226
And that's the good of it?

33:40.310 --> 33:41.894
Yes, sir, that's the good.

33:41.978 --> 33:46.107
[Chuckles]
Go to sleep, Jake Roedel.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.364
[Chuckles]

Lloyd and Curtain last night.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.973
Seems those bushwhackers
are not real soldiers.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.641
[Man Shouting]
Had it with you, boy!

34:20.726 --> 34:25.563

Hey, Jake, what are you knowing?

34:38.452 --> 34:40.786
I feel I'm knowin' too much.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.873
- Ah. Well, forget it. Throw it down.
- [Shouting Continues]

34:43.956 --> 34:49.545
- We could've merely shot them.
- Well, that was not the plan, Jake.

34:49.629 --> 34:52.965
Might be no rhyme to it,
but that was just plain old not the plan.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.652
- [Man] Jake.
- Aw.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.113
Black John says you're lettered.
It's Union mail.

35:16.198 --> 35:18.783
Wants you to look it over,
tell him if there's anything to learn.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.409
All right.

35:27.250 --> 35:31.545
Well, it's just stuff from up north.
There's no military intelligence in here.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.758
Yeah. Well, maybe you could
read it to us just the same.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.429
Read us this letter, Dutchy.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.308
That's someone else's letter.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.186
Was. I wanna hear you read it.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.356
I don't think I care to.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.192
Oh, is that so?

35:53.276 --> 35:56.111
Well, I think that if you think
a little bit more, Dutchy...

35:56.196 --> 35:58.739
you'll think you do wanna read it me.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.658
Right now too.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.207
How do we know there
might be secrets in it?

36:08.291 --> 36:10.000
Read it at us.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.962
- [Man] Yeah, come on, Dutchy.
- [Laughter]

36:13.964 --> 36:16.382
All right.

36:16.466 --> 36:21.303
This here is from Mrs. Mary Williams
of Bear Lake, Wisconsin.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.309
"Dear Sons,
No word of you in so long...

36:27.394 --> 36:30.396
"right past first frost of the year last.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.731
"Your father is better,
but his feet are still bloatin'.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.316
He won't walk right on them."

36:34.401 --> 36:38.028
That's thicked-up blood does that.
Thicked-up blood bloats the feet.

36:39.573 --> 36:41.740
'Fire hit the old church.
Burned down.

36:41.825 --> 36:45.244
"The new one was just ready,
so no great trouble was had of it.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.997
"Margaret is married
since the frost of this year last.

36:48.081 --> 36:52.459
"You wouldn't know it, for how could you?
Her husband is Walter Maddox.

36:52.544 --> 36:56.297
'He is out of the war,
with one arm busted at New Madrid.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.757
"But it works fine enough.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.928
"The dirt was turned over,
and the smell and deepness gave me heart.

37:05.181 --> 37:08.893
It is just black rich.
You boys know how that is."

37:08.977 --> 37:11.770
My daddy was up there.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.940
He was up there
way before they hung him.

37:15.025 --> 37:17.818
He said the dirt was so rich
you could've ate it like porridge.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.362
They have very good dirt up there.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.656
Short grow season.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.367
Yeah, sounds like real good dirt to me.

37:27.203 --> 37:32.082
"That girl Dave got sweet for is in town
and still single and about.

37:32.167 --> 37:36.670
"She asks of you, but I have no news
since first frost of the year last.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.590
"Without news,
I cannot answer her.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.011
You are both missed here.
Your mother."

37:46.014 --> 37:49.099
Sounds like my mother -
that old woman does.

37:50.185 --> 37:53.687
One mother's
very much like another.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.566
Remember one thing.
Her boys will kill you if they can.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.406
[Clears Throat]

38:18.588 --> 38:21.340
[Black John]
It is time for our winter hibernation.

38:21.424 --> 38:25.678
I have gathered the names
of loyal Southerners who shall provide for us.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.680
We'll group in fours.

38:27.764 --> 38:32.267
I'll send word the beginnin' of spring
for where to rendezvous.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.896
We shall to the Evans farm, boys.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.857
Their place is about half a mile
from the Willards'...

38:38.942 --> 38:41.860
where there resides
a certain Miss Juanita...

38:41.945 --> 38:43.862
to whom, if I do not flatter myself...

38:43.947 --> 38:46.573
my attentions are not
unfavorably regarded.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.867
You mean to say we're to spend
the winter in Lafayette...

38:48.952 --> 38:51.870
solely on account that
you're sweet on Juanita Willard?

38:51.955 --> 38:54.707
Ach, it's as good a reason as any, Dutchy.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.006
Nolan's brought some news from home.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.008
Hank Pattison is murdered.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.344
Our old neighbor Jantzen got him
with his gang of militia.

39:07.429 --> 39:10.723
That is sad. He was a good Southern man.
What of Thomas?

39:10.807 --> 39:12.891
Oh, he is murdered too.

39:12.976 --> 39:15.936
And Sally Burgess
married a Federal from Michigan.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.398
- [Scoffs]
- [Chuckles] Her whole family hides their faces.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.987
And -

39:26.406 --> 39:28.407
Well, Dutchy...

39:28.491 --> 39:30.993
that Federal Alf Bowden -

39:32.328 --> 39:35.330
he rode straight from here
and killed your father.

39:37.542 --> 39:41.045
He shot him in the neck
down by the river...

39:41.129 --> 39:44.298
then booted him
along Main Street till he died.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.846
I spared Alf Bowden.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.892
You all know it.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.937
You taught him mercy,
but he forgot the lesson.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.817
My father -

40:03.902 --> 40:07.196
My father was a Unionist
like all the Germans.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.364
An unconditional Unionist.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.241
Well, yeah.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.453
But he was mainly known
as your father, Dutchy.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.372
You got a reputation now.

41:15.265 --> 41:17.307
[Man]
Hello there, boys.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.309
[Clyde]
Good day, sir.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.645
- Gabel Evans.
- George Clyde.

41:23.606 --> 41:28.277
Sorry we can't all be of proper hospitality,
but with the Federal patrols -

41:28.361 --> 41:31.905
We're much obliged.
May I ask after Mrs. Evans?

41:31.990 --> 41:36.368
My wife.
Well, she's as well as can be expected.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.705
Our other Mrs. Evans -
that's Sue Lee -

41:39.789 --> 41:43.375
Well, she was a Mrs. Evans
for but three weeks...

41:43.459 --> 41:46.503
until my son joined
our Confederate forces.

41:48.798 --> 41:52.134
He was killed in the fightin'
at Independence.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.723
We're sorry to hear of it.

41:57.807 --> 42:02.352
Yes. Well, you boys lay low.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.813
We'll come by from time to time
with provisions...

42:04.898 --> 42:07.274
such as there are.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.318
[Clyde]
We're much obliged.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.573
[Grunting]

42:24.542 --> 42:27.419
[Digging Continues]

42:27.503 --> 42:29.463
[Grunting Continues]

42:32.675 --> 42:36.261
It's been a while since we done work.
Somethin' soothin' to it.

42:38.014 --> 42:41.850
Yeah, well, work has never been
my main ambition.

42:41.935 --> 42:45.520
Ah, we've done much work.
I think I've spied an easier way to riches.

42:45.605 --> 42:48.023
Spell out this miracle.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.525
You just ride on up and take it.

42:50.610 --> 42:55.239
Ah, good old rule.
A simple plan.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.991
It's a workable method.
That is proven.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.286
[All Grunting]

43:01.371 --> 43:04.164
Now, George...

43:04.249 --> 43:05.749
you got mud in your eye.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.751
- Mmm.
- [Both Laughing]

43:07.835 --> 43:11.046
- [Jake] Rider comin'.
- Oh, let's go see our visitor.

43:18.554 --> 43:22.140
[Woman] Just me! Don't shoot
or some dumb thing like that.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.487
- Whoa.
- Well, how do?

43:35.571 --> 43:38.573
- You must be Mrs. Evans.
- I brung you some supper.

43:42.203 --> 43:45.789
- [Sniffs] I'm, uh, pleased to meet you, Mr. - 
- Chiles.

43:45.873 --> 43:50.127
Mr. Jack Bull Chiles.
This is Jake Roedel.

43:50.211 --> 43:52.587
- And -
- George Clyde, Mrs. Evans.

43:53.756 --> 43:58.135
Mr. Evans wishes me to apologize
for not havin' sent you food sooner.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.137
The Federals have been on the move.

44:01.139 --> 44:05.350
And don't you call me Mrs. Evans.
My name is Sue Lee Shelley.

44:05.435 --> 44:08.103
It's a good one,
and I am a widow now.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.689
Reckon I'll go back to it and use it.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.733
Please pardon me.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.321
Won't you come in?
It's not much to gaze upon...

44:17.405 --> 44:20.032
but I reckon we could assay
some hospitality.

44:20.116 --> 44:23.160
- George.
- After me, ma'am.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.046
- Right this way, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

44:34.130 --> 44:36.089
[Sue Lee]
Thank you.

44:40.887 --> 44:43.138
Damn.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.018
What are you smilin' at?

44:49.187 --> 44:51.480
I'll see to that mule.

44:52.774 --> 44:54.691
Wait a second.
What did you say?

44:54.776 --> 44:57.402
I say I'll look to him.

44:57.487 --> 45:01.448
You better go on in there.
Let that woman see your face.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.452
Damnation, Holt.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.038
I think I know best
how to handle my personal affairs.

45:08.122 --> 45:11.166
Now, you see that lady's mule
while I check on what she brung to eat.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.714
- [Jack Bull] Excuse the mud. We'll just -
- [Clyde] There you go, ma'am.

45:28.476 --> 45:31.019
My!
[Sighs]

45:31.104 --> 45:32.896
Well, aren't you bushwhackers
the gentlemen.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.899
We try to make the effort
when possible, ma'am.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.610
Do you think manners should be dropped
in times like these?

45:38.694 --> 45:42.697
No. But I don't think horse sense
oughta be dropped either.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.699
[Chuckles]
It's cold.

45:46.619 --> 45:49.287
[Chuckles]

45:49.372 --> 45:52.416
You're so kind to think of us, ma'am.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.794
You men think of us more.
You do the good work.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.547
I know it's dirty and it's dangerous.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.967
Those are good words to hear, ma'am.

46:02.051 --> 46:04.010
It's - It's not always we hear them.

46:10.184 --> 46:13.478
[Clears Throat]
Well, I really should be goin'.

46:13.563 --> 46:15.897
Mrs. Evans will worry if I don't.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.568
Uh, ma'am?

46:21.070 --> 46:24.906
We're awful sorry about
Evans Jr. Gettin' killed.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.160
Well, we all suffer.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.120
But he suffers no more.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.456
He was a good husband to me.

46:32.540 --> 46:36.585
For three weeks he was a good husband,
but he didn't last.

46:43.593 --> 46:46.011
What's he doin' here, inside?

46:46.095 --> 46:49.431
Oh, ma'am, this - this nigger's with me.
His name is Holt.

46:49.515 --> 46:54.686
Well, wouldn't he be more useful
off in a field plowin'?

46:54.770 --> 46:57.022
[Chuckles]

46:57.106 --> 46:59.065
Oh, no, I reckon not.

46:59.150 --> 47:03.069
No, ma'am. That's, uh, one nigger
I wouldn't try to hitch behind a plow.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.489
No, I wouldn't try that.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.783
Well, now.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.164
Oh, I almost forgot.

47:14.248 --> 47:17.751
Mr. Evans asked that you come to the house
tomorrow evenin' after dark.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.921
He's up on the latest Federal movements,
and he could post you on 'em.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.589
[Jack Bull]
Why, we'd be honored.

47:22.673 --> 47:27.385
Um, I'm not sure about him.
Mr. Evans -

47:27.470 --> 47:29.554
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about on that score.

47:29.639 --> 47:31.556
You needn't worry about Holt.

47:31.641 --> 47:34.643
I'll be takin' Holt with me
to the Willards' tomorrow.

47:34.727 --> 47:36.436
We won't be comin' to your dinner.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.522
Mr. Clyde, honestly...

47:38.606 --> 47:40.607
I didn't mean to speak ill
of your nigger.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.442
He's not my nigger.

47:42.527 --> 47:46.863
He's just a nigger who I trust with my life
every day and night, that's all.

47:48.658 --> 47:52.327
- That's very high praise.
- Yes, ma'am, it is.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.329
I see.

47:54.413 --> 47:57.749
Well, gentlemen,
I really must take my leave.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.961
- I hope the food'll please you.
- It looks wonderful.

48:01.045 --> 48:04.047
Why, thank you.
Now good night, all.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.466
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.928
Holt, the lady said good night to all.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.930
Now touch your hat and say good night.

48:12.014 --> 48:14.266
- Chiles, you don't tell him nothin'.
- He's bein' rude.

48:14.350 --> 48:16.685
- Gentlemen, please.
- He don't need no tellin', Chiles!

48:16.769 --> 48:18.979
It's all right, George.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.147
Good night, missy.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.693
Good night, Holt.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.950
I'll see the lady to her mule.

48:36.205 --> 48:39.583
- Holt.
- It weren't no hardship, George.

48:41.127 --> 48:43.795
Well, let's eat. This smells good.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.047
- Be careful.
- Good evening.

48:46.132 --> 48:47.757
[Clicks Teeth]

49:14.076 --> 49:16.703
Holt, you want my bacon?

49:22.251 --> 49:24.252
I could eat more.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.421
Go on then.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.510
Appreciate it.

49:35.598 --> 49:36.765
Roedel...

49:39.602 --> 49:41.561
you want my bacon?

49:44.774 --> 49:46.691
Yes, I could eat it.

49:46.776 --> 49:49.361
Well, I'll shit it out
by the oak tree in the mornin'.

49:49.445 --> 49:52.447
You can just go and help yourself.
[Laughing]

49:52.531 --> 49:55.408
[Coughing]

50:03.292 --> 50:05.418
And why, if you do not mind my askin'...

50:05.503 --> 50:07.712
did you not join the regular army?

50:07.797 --> 50:11.383
Army? Well, we thought of it.

50:11.467 --> 50:15.053
I suppose we decided this fight's
got to be made in our own country...

50:15.137 --> 50:18.306
not where some general
tells us it should happen.

50:18.391 --> 50:20.850
It soon will be everywhere.

50:20.935 --> 50:24.479
My family and I,
we will be quittin' this house in the spring.

50:24.563 --> 50:29.150
As soon as the roads are clear,
we're gonna be tryin' for Texas.

50:29.235 --> 50:32.112
About half of Missouri
has went to Texas.

50:32.196 --> 50:35.240
Well, the whole state's thick with invaders.

50:35.324 --> 50:38.535
We cannot drive them away.

50:38.619 --> 50:42.163
We have different thoughts.
I still wanna fight.

50:42.248 --> 50:46.000
Reckon I'll always want to fight them.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.295
Always.

50:55.428 --> 50:58.054
Have you ever been
to Lawrence, Kansas, young man?

50:58.139 --> 51:01.141
[Scoffs]
No, I reckon not, Mr. Evans.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.977
I don't believe I'd be
too welcome in Lawrence.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.979
I didn't think so.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.441
Before this war began,
my business took me there often.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.985
As I saw those Northerners
build that town...

51:12.069 --> 51:14.988
I witnessed the seeds
of our destruction being sown.

51:15.072 --> 51:19.284
The foundin' of that town was truly
the beginnin' of the Yankee invasion.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.286
I'm not speakin' of numbers...

51:21.370 --> 51:25.457
nor even abolitionist trouble-makin'.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.001
It was the schoolhouse.

51:28.085 --> 51:32.422
Before they built their church even,
they built that schoolhouse.

51:32.506 --> 51:37.302
And they lettered every tailor's son
and every farmer's daughter in that country.

51:37.386 --> 51:41.723
Oh, spellin' won't help you
hold a plow any firmer.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.725
Or a gun either.

51:43.809 --> 51:45.977
No, it won't, Mr. Chiles.

51:46.061 --> 51:50.982
But my point is merely that they rounded
every pup up into that schoolhouse...

51:51.066 --> 51:54.110
because they fancied
that everyone should think...

51:54.195 --> 51:57.447
and talk the same
free-thinkin' way they do...

51:57.531 --> 52:00.450
with no regard to station, custom...

52:00.534 --> 52:03.119
propriety.

52:03.204 --> 52:05.663
And that is why they will win.

52:05.748 --> 52:09.709
Because they believe everyone
should live and think just like them.

52:11.420 --> 52:16.007
And we shall lose because we don't care
one way or another how they live.

52:17.218 --> 52:19.135
We just worry about ourselves.

52:21.430 --> 52:24.098
Are you sayin', sir,
that we fight for nothin'?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.853
Far from it, Mr. Chiles.

52:28.938 --> 52:31.606
You fight for everything that we ever had.

52:31.690 --> 52:34.526
As did my son.

52:34.610 --> 52:38.446
It's just that we don't have it anymore.

52:39.615 --> 52:42.992
Mr. Evans, when you get back from Texas...

52:43.077 --> 52:44.536
it'll all be here waitin' for you.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.955
Jack Bull and me, we'll see to it.

52:47.039 --> 52:50.583
Well, yes.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.379
Thank you, son.

52:54.463 --> 52:56.673
Well, enough of this war talk.

52:56.757 --> 53:00.635
Let's have the ladies join us
and think nobler thoughts.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.762
- Lydia!
- [Jack Bull] Fine idea.

53:02.847 --> 53:04.722
Some company would be splendid.

53:04.807 --> 53:07.141
Jack Bull, we should be
thinkin' about gettin' back.

53:07.226 --> 53:08.393
Federals could pass by anytime.

53:08.477 --> 53:11.896
- [Lydia] Sue Lee!
- Oh, put a gown on, Jake. It's too cold.

53:11.981 --> 53:14.983
They'll all be in front of the fire
examinin' their plunder, huh?

53:16.777 --> 53:20.947
I, um, have it in me to sing.
Shall we have a sing-along?

53:21.031 --> 53:23.575
- Oh, yes. I like those the best.
- [Clearing Throat]

53:23.659 --> 53:26.035
My voice is not
what it should be these days...

53:26.120 --> 53:28.288
but it was once rumored
that I could carry a tune.

53:28.372 --> 53:29.873
And you, Mr. Roedel?

53:29.957 --> 53:33.167
I believe I won't sing.
Young ears are present.

53:33.252 --> 53:35.128
- [Chuckles]
- Well, I bet you sing lovely.

53:35.212 --> 53:39.173
- You would lose that bet.
- He really does sing very poorly.

53:39.258 --> 53:41.843
- But he imitates the turkey first-rate.
- [Giggles]

53:41.927 --> 53:43.761
I'd best do my gobblin' out of doors.

53:43.846 --> 53:46.556
You folks go ahead and sing along.
I'll keep my eye on the road.

53:46.640 --> 53:50.685
- Do you really think that -
- Good man, Jake. I'll relieve you soon.

53:54.189 --> 53:56.816
[Clears Throat]

54:05.534 --> 54:08.745
## [Singing In Distance]

54:23.427 --> 54:27.472
## [Singing Continues]

54:50.955 --> 54:53.081
[Clattering]

54:59.630 --> 55:02.340
Clyde back?

55:02.424 --> 55:07.679
I believe he's, uh, fixin' to pass
a few more hours with Miss Juanita.

55:07.763 --> 55:11.432
- Jack Bull?
- In the company of Mrs. Sue Lee Evans.

55:12.893 --> 55:14.978
You mean Sue Lee Shelley?

55:18.565 --> 55:21.067
- Roedel.
- Yeah, Holt.

55:24.989 --> 55:27.699
What's that?

55:27.783 --> 55:30.493
I've been keeping 'em.

55:30.577 --> 55:32.870
Nobody ever learned me letters.

55:32.955 --> 55:35.039
When you were readin'
the mails out loud...

55:35.124 --> 55:38.292
it was somethin'
the likes of which I'd never heard.

55:38.377 --> 55:41.212
Got me thinkin' you might
sometime try it again.

55:41.296 --> 55:44.048
So you packed those
and kept 'em all this time?

55:45.092 --> 55:47.969
Well, it might not be too amusin'.

55:48.053 --> 55:51.222
It might just be a bunch of borin' thoughts
from one stranger to another.

55:51.306 --> 55:55.059
That one you read from the mother was fine.
You recall it?

55:55.144 --> 55:56.811
Yeah.

55:56.895 --> 56:00.064
Mmm. She say things I enjoy to hear.

56:00.149 --> 56:02.483
All right. Here it goes.

56:03.736 --> 56:06.571
"Dear Brother,
I must write this right quick...

56:06.655 --> 56:11.200
"'cause I say good-bye to Massachusetts
and our home in one hour.

56:11.285 --> 56:12.952
"Yes, Danny, I've joined the fight...

56:13.037 --> 56:16.372
"and a difficulter decision
never before was made...

56:16.457 --> 56:19.751
"as I've been just about the only
eligible bachelor to dance with...

56:19.835 --> 56:22.503
"at Parlan's this past year.

56:22.588 --> 56:25.465
"Without my favorite brother,
it is not the same...

56:25.549 --> 56:27.467
"although the beer has been free...

56:27.551 --> 56:31.804
"as I've been drinkin' it
with one of the Parlans' daughters.

56:31.889 --> 56:34.557
"Which one, I will not tell.

56:34.641 --> 56:38.144
Here's to you, Danny,
and keep your head low out there. Bill."

56:41.940 --> 56:45.526
It could come to where
you could maybe like that man.

56:45.611 --> 56:46.986
Yeah.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.739
In other times
he would not be so bad.

56:52.242 --> 56:55.453
I think though I like the one
from the mama best.

57:01.877 --> 57:04.128
Holt...

57:04.213 --> 57:06.214
where is your mother?

57:06.298 --> 57:10.009
- Uh, Kansas or Kingdom.
- [Cork Pops]

57:10.094 --> 57:12.095
I don't know.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.807
[Sighs]

57:15.891 --> 57:17.892
I know she was sold into Texas.

57:19.728 --> 57:21.896
I reckon she in Texas.

57:24.191 --> 57:26.484
How was that?
Was that George that sold her?

57:26.568 --> 57:27.902
No, sir.

57:27.986 --> 57:30.655
George and me,
we growed up neighbors.

57:30.739 --> 57:34.992
It was George what bought me out
when Master Henry passed, but...

57:35.077 --> 57:38.412
he didn't have no means
for my mama or my sister.

57:40.374 --> 57:43.626
- So Clyde owns you?
- No, sir.

57:43.710 --> 57:46.587
Not in greenbacks and coppers nohow.

57:46.672 --> 57:49.006
No, he don't own me that way.

57:49.091 --> 57:51.050
Nope.

57:52.553 --> 57:55.096
He made of that a gift.

58:13.866 --> 58:16.659
- [Knocking]
- It's me.

58:16.743 --> 58:19.245
- Hey, Jake.
- [Grunts]

58:19.329 --> 58:21.414
Your aim is wild.
You splattered poor Holt.

58:21.498 --> 58:24.876
- [Sue Lee] Well, it surely is.
- Oh, no. Mm-mmm.

58:24.960 --> 58:26.502
Mmm!

58:26.587 --> 58:28.045
- Ah!
- [Laughing]

58:28.130 --> 58:32.550
- Whoa, mule! Settle down there!
- Mule? "Whoa, mule"?

58:32.634 --> 58:35.052
Just calm down.

58:35.137 --> 58:38.472
Well, do I look muley to you?

58:38.557 --> 58:41.475
[Jack Bull]
Why, no.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.978
Well, does that
look like a mule to you?

58:44.062 --> 58:48.649
Does that look like the rear end of
an animal that hee-haws in the night?

58:48.734 --> 58:51.986
- Looks like it might could be.
- Jack Bull Chiles!

58:52.070 --> 58:55.698
Just 'cause I'm a widow don't mean
that you can get that familiar with me.

58:55.782 --> 58:59.410
Pardon me, ma'am, but I believe it was you
that shoved your rump into my face.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.287
That was only just to make a point.

59:01.371 --> 59:05.750
You made it.
I'll always know your rump from a mule's now.

59:05.834 --> 59:09.378
Several differences.
Don't know how I missed 'em before.

59:12.299 --> 59:15.760
[Gasps]
Well, don't be mean.

59:15.844 --> 59:17.970
I can't tolerate meanness.

59:21.433 --> 59:22.516
[Whimpering Softly]

59:32.110 --> 59:35.112
- Is that too mean?
- No.

59:35.197 --> 59:37.323
It's really not too mean at all.

59:40.619 --> 59:44.664
Oh, for cryin' out loud! We're sittin' right here.
Show us some mercy.

59:48.877 --> 59:51.420
[Sighs]
He really is quite right.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.674
Mmm, I better get back to the house.

59:54.758 --> 01:00:00.346
Cover your tracks in the snow too.
You'll be leadin' curious Federals right onto us.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.474
Don't be rude.
You have no reason to be rude.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:06.644
There happens to be a war goin' on...

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.021
everywhere but between your two ears,
you dumb ox.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:12.608
Dumb ox, am I?
[Grunts]

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.740
Sorry, Jake.
My leg just did that on its own.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.867
No thought behind it.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:24.996
I hear you. I hear you.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.456
But Holt and me ain't dyin'
just so you could be kissed.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:31.544
Leave Holt out of this. Holt ain't even here.
Holt ain't nowhere near here.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.880
I don't think anybody's
about to die from my kiss.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.550
In fact, she seems
to be doin' tolerably well.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.011
Well enough to get goin' too.

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:42.013
Good day.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.323
You reckon George Clyde'll ever
join up with us again?

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:04.201
Or do you think Juanita Willard will be
his only cause and comfort from here on?

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:08.581
Ah, George is efficient
when it comes to comfort.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.249
Ah!

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.877
This thing with Sue Lee and you -
Will it go on?

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.587
I would reckon.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.006
Well, that's good for you.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.716
Yep.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.801
I believe I'll marry her.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.845
I believe you should.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.656
Sue Lee'll be by this evening.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:45.201
Oh, good.
It's been near a week since I've seen her.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:50.581
Yeah, all this warmth has the Federals
out for jaunts. It's kept her home.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.833
It won't be long
before we join them out there.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.418
No, it won't.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:56.670
That's why I want to ask somethin'
of you and Holt.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.255
Name it.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.801
Well, there, future best man,
I'd like to ask you for some privacy.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:06.389
Oh, you would, would you?

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.599
It's not much to ask.

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.601
And what are Holt and me to do?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.353
Anything you'd like.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:14.939
Throw walnuts at squirrels.
Play mumblety-peg.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:18.442
I reckon we could come up with a better
use of our time than that, eh, Holt?

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.444
It's possible.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.873
[Jake]
Mmm.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.007
Howdy.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.597
I, um, brung you two somethin'.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.726
Try this bread, boys.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.147
Why, thank you. Did you make it?

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.650
No. Mrs. Evans's sister lives in town.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:03.070
She's a Federal, but a sister still.
She gave us two loaves.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:06.991
Well, that's kind of her.
You thank her for us, won't you?

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:10.828
[Chuckles] I don't suppose I'll tell her
where it went. That might not do.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.831
- [Jack Bull Clears Throat]
- [Sue Lee Clears Throat]

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.335
Well, this good weather has me and Holt...

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.214
wantin' to fling walnuts
at mumblety-peg players...

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.966
or something along those lines.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.968
[Jack Bull]
All right. Now have fun.

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:30.598
[Whispering]
Jake. One hour, please.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.192
[Jake's Voice]
'Dearest Ruth Ann...

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:44.361
"I trust this letter
will reach you before winter.

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:48.240
'Here it is always a sort of winter,
as folks are so cold now.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.659
'Rebels are out of the city
as far as armies go...

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:54.288
'but there are copperheads around
performing misdeeds.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:56.707
"So much cruelty goes on.

"Gratiot Prison is full of rebels,

"They are traitors, but also human.

"If you looked in on them,
you would not believe that they were...

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:11.013
"for they so resemble scarecrows now.

"Father believes the war will go on and on...

"but is ever more committed

"He manages to send ever greater
numbers of slaves up north...

"to freedom and away from
the grasping hands of their masters...

"who even in the midst of all

"The Confederates claim that
we strike at their liberty and rights...

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:40.793
"but what kind of liberty is it
that takes away the liberty of others?

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.672
The war will end."

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.055
Has it been an hour yet?

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.184
No. Ain't no hour passed yet.

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.481
Roedel...

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.068
you know my name?

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.444
It's Holt.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:10.364
No, my whole name.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:16.036
My whole name is Daniel Holt.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:22.376
Daniel. Like that lion's den man.
You know his story?

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.795
Of course I do.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.840
They throwed Daniel to the lions...

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.676
but he won't never ate.

gets on our tail.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:43.202
You got that, Roedel. But why not?

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:47.665

for them Federals to pick us off anyhow.

01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:40.331
Oh.

01:54:40.415 --> 01:54:43.042
So, do you figure I ought to be married?

01:54:43.126 --> 01:54:46.796
Yeah, if you want to keep fingers
from waggin' in your face.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.090
That doesn't bother me.

01:54:49.174 --> 01:54:52.093
Well, it's also another thing, Sue Lee.

01:54:52.177 --> 01:54:56.180
See, they got a name for kids without daddies.
You know, it ain't a good one.

01:54:57.307 --> 01:54:59.100
I know that.

01:55:04.773 --> 01:55:06.774
So, do you want to marry me?

01:55:10.904 --> 01:55:12.863
No, not too bad.

01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:16.325
Good. That's good news...

01:55:16.410 --> 01:55:19.203
'cause I wouldn't marry you
for a wagon load full of gold.

01:55:19.288 --> 01:55:20.955
I bet you wouldn't.

01:55:21.039 --> 01:55:23.457
I wouldn't marry you even if you weren't
some runty little Dutchman...

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:25.042
with nubbin for a finger.

01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:27.378
Fine. That's damn fine.

01:55:27.462 --> 01:55:30.047
I wouldn't want a wife that didn't know
how to keep her place.

01:55:30.132 --> 01:55:33.050
Anyhow, it's a proven thing
that being your man is just plain bad luck...

01:55:33.135 --> 01:55:35.469
and I don't need to marry any of that.

01:55:38.307 --> 01:55:40.391
Well, it's true.

01:55:42.811 --> 01:55:44.395
Guess it's true.

01:55:44.479 --> 01:55:49.317
[Sighs] You're not bad luck.
You just had bad luck, is all.

01:55:51.987 --> 01:55:54.530
I need convincin' you mean that.

01:55:55.532 --> 01:55:57.408
I need convincin' that you were right.

01:56:16.762 --> 01:56:19.347
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.023
[Sighs]
I believe I'll catch some air.

01:56:29.107 --> 01:56:31.025
Well, breathe some for me.

[Sue Lee Chattering]

01:56:39.201 --> 01:56:43.329
Perhaps you boys can watch after
this little one while I'm at my chores.

01:56:43.413 --> 01:56:46.749
Yeah, maybe it's best you talk to him
about that particular line of work.

01:56:47.876 --> 01:56:49.502
- Who, me?
- [Sue Lee] That's right.

01:56:49.586 --> 01:56:53.381
- [Grace Fussing]
- About time we have some help around here.

01:56:53.465 --> 01:56:55.383
Be back around noontime.

01:56:55.467 --> 01:56:58.052
- Sue Lee, wait a second.
- [Crying]

01:56:58.136 --> 01:57:01.555
Oh. Come on.

01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:14.777
- Oh, come on.
- [Crying Continues]

01:57:17.239 --> 01:57:20.199
[Laughing]

01:57:20.283 --> 01:57:22.827
Ooh! Hee!

01:57:22.911 --> 01:57:24.912
[High-pitched Voice]
Hi! Ooh!

[Crying Continues]

01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:34.255
[Crying Stops, Babbling]

01:57:41.471 --> 01:57:44.265
I knew that nubbin
would be good for somethin'.

[Footsteps Approaching]

01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:50.271
[Door Closes]

01:57:52.357 --> 01:57:55.192
Where you been?
She's been screamin' for hours.

01:57:55.277 --> 01:57:58.529
Sweet thing wants some sup,
but Mama's been busy.

01:57:58.613 --> 01:58:00.531
- Here. I'll feed her.
- No, you won't.

01:58:00.615 --> 01:58:02.825
I just got this thing taken care of.

01:58:03.952 --> 01:58:05.536
She needs to be suckled, Jake.

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.788
Well, hell.

01:58:07.873 --> 01:58:09.790
Hmm?

01:58:09.875 --> 01:58:13.210
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
It's okay.

01:58:24.806 --> 01:58:27.057
It's okay.

[Sue Lee Whispering]

01:58:33.732 --> 01:58:35.274
[Chuckles]

01:58:39.154 --> 01:58:41.197
[Whispering]
Yes

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:45.493
They're all busted up.

01:58:45.577 --> 01:58:49.288
- [Jake] Quantrill?
- Headed to Kentucky.

01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:52.416
- Anderson?
- Dead, I've heard tell.

01:58:52.501 --> 01:58:55.419
Thrailkill, Clement -

01:58:55.504 --> 01:58:57.421
most of 'em dead.

01:58:57.506 --> 01:58:59.298
Pitt Mackeson.

01:58:59.382 --> 01:59:02.760
[Babe]
He's got himself something of a gang.

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:07.640
But these days, they spend
most of their time robbin' for plunder.

01:59:07.724 --> 01:59:11.560
And they don't care whether they take it
from Southern folks or Federals.

01:59:11.645 --> 01:59:15.731
Anyone gets in their way,
off comes their scalp.

01:59:16.858 --> 01:59:21.612
Anyhow, they don't ride much in Jackson
or Cass Counties anymore.

01:59:21.696 --> 01:59:23.948
Word has it they're headin' south.

01:59:25.033 --> 01:59:27.952
Probably make you a visit.

01:59:28.036 --> 01:59:31.914
Word is, they're makin'
a plan of it, Jake.

- Can't sleep?
- No.

01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:57.481
These quilts are too heavy.
They make me sweat.

You know, Holt...

02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:12.830
I probably got one more fight in me.

02:00:12.914 --> 02:00:15.833
[Breathing Heavily]

02:00:15.917 --> 02:00:18.002
I'm gonna kill Pitt Mackeson...

02:00:18.086 --> 02:00:21.005
either when he comes here,
or when I can get up to find him out.

02:00:21.089 --> 02:00:23.507
- You know that, Holt?
- Yeah, I know it.

02:00:25.427 --> 02:00:29.096
What you gonna do after you kill Pitt?
You gonna join up with them Regulars?

02:00:30.891 --> 02:00:32.892
Fight for the cause.

02:00:34.394 --> 02:00:36.353

What cause you think I got, Roedel?

02:00:50.619 --> 02:00:53.662
When them Yankees come
and kill George daddy...

02:00:53.747 --> 02:00:57.541
and his brothers and all his people,
I stood with George Clyde.

02:00:58.543 --> 02:01:02.630
Yeah, he was as good a friend to you
as Jack Bull was to me.

02:01:02.714 --> 02:01:04.882
Yeah.

02:01:04.966 --> 02:01:08.636
And they's both good and dead now,
Roedel.

02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.888
Just as dead as they can be.

02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:16.644
Where does that leave you and me, huh?

02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:22.441
Where does that leave me?

02:01:22.525 --> 02:01:24.985
Right here, Holt.

02:01:27.572 --> 02:01:29.990
Yeah, I knowed we was right here.

02:01:33.495 --> 02:01:35.412
This ain't nowhere for me.

02:01:37.999 --> 02:01:41.043
I reckon I just don't understand it.

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:43.796
That day George Clyde died...

02:01:46.007 --> 02:01:47.925
it changed me.

02:02:09.114 --> 02:02:10.364
free.

02:02:13.535 --> 02:02:16.870
I thought that's what George gave you
when he bought you out.

02:02:17.914 --> 02:02:19.832
That weren't really his to give,
now, was it?

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:21.417
[Breathing Heavily]

02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:24.211
And, George Clyde -
I believe I loved him.

02:02:26.423 --> 02:02:30.634
But bein' that man's friend...

02:02:30.719 --> 02:02:33.220
wasn't no different
than bein' his nigger.

02:02:35.432 --> 02:02:37.433
And, Roedel...

02:02:38.476 --> 02:02:41.562

gonna be nobody's nigger.

so won't be much longer.

by some different fellas here pretty soon.

02:04:43.476 --> 02:04:45.060
Oh, I don't know.

02:04:45.145 --> 02:04:48.564
Maybe trek me on over to California...

02:04:48.648 --> 02:04:51.859
and catch me a sailboat
to somewhere sunny.

02:04:51.943 --> 02:04:53.902
Is that right?

02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:58.448

in mind, Jake?

02:05:00.285 --> 02:05:02.369
Sparta.

02:05:02.453 --> 02:05:05.873
In Sparta, they have olives.
I got that out of a book.

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:10.460
I could eat me some olives.

02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:14.798
Olives. What are olives like?

02:05:14.883 --> 02:05:17.384
I don't know firsthand.
I never had one yet.

and nothin' could be more trouble
to eat than them.

02:05:27.645 --> 02:05:29.605
I wonder about me.

I ain't goin' sailin' nowhere,
and I know it.

02:05:38.406 --> 02:05:40.365

tired tonight when he gets back from his ride.

That the man?

02:06:43.638 --> 02:06:46.765
That's him. Dutchy Roedel.

02:06:46.849 --> 02:06:48.558
What is this?

02:06:48.643 --> 02:06:51.395
This here is the Reverend Horace Wright.

02:06:51.479 --> 02:06:53.689
You're gettin' married today, Dutchy.

02:06:53.773 --> 02:06:56.525
You're gettin' married
or you're gettin' out.

02:06:56.609 --> 02:06:57.859
I'm what?

02:06:57.944 --> 02:07:00.279
You heard me. You're all healed up.

02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:04.199
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't die slow on me before I did it.

02:07:04.284 --> 02:07:07.536
- I can't have it in my house the way it is.
- It's time.

02:07:08.579 --> 02:07:11.999
Holt, saddle my horse.
We're gettin' out of here.

02:07:12.083 --> 02:07:15.377
No. You should do right, Roedel.

02:07:16.379 --> 02:07:18.422
What on earth does that mean?

02:07:20.008 --> 02:07:22.092

It's bein' shoved down my throat.

02:07:43.531 --> 02:07:46.366
If a thing has got to be shoved,
I like to do the shovin'.

02:07:47.368 --> 02:07:48.869
Okay.

02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:53.749
- [Sighs]
- Then get in there and shove, Jake.

02:07:53.833 --> 02:07:55.751
I thought you said
you wouldn't want me...

02:07:55.835 --> 02:07:59.713
for a wagonload of gold 'cause
I'm a nubbin-fingered runt of a Dutchman.

02:07:59.797 --> 02:08:01.423
I remember you sayin' that.

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:05.302
Well, I guess I lied.

Are you lyin' again now?

02:08:11.809 --> 02:08:14.895
No. I wouldn't lie to you, Jake.

Well, that's different.

02:08:21.652 --> 02:08:23.445
That was romance.

And now's what?

02:08:30.411 --> 02:08:32.329
The truth.

02:08:33.331 --> 02:08:35.624

bein' the man, take you,
Sue Lee Shelley Evans, bein' the woman.

02:08:46.928 --> 02:08:50.680
So, by the power vested in me,
the two of you is right married.

02:08:50.765 --> 02:08:52.682
Ain't it so.

02:08:55.770 --> 02:08:58.021
Well, that was sure a fast ceremony.

02:08:58.106 --> 02:09:00.273
Well, I reckon that man
would marry stones to stones...

02:09:00.358 --> 02:09:02.317
if there was a chicken at the end of it.

02:09:02.402 --> 02:09:04.319
Ah, that's neither here
nor somewheres else.

02:09:04.404 --> 02:09:06.863
He just done made you legal, boy.

02:09:27.218 --> 02:09:29.136
Good night, boys.

Good night, Ort.

[Snoring Continues]

02:09:47.405 --> 02:09:51.408
So you a family man now.
How you feel?

02:09:51.492 --> 02:09:54.828
I feel the same, Holt.
Hell, it's only words.

02:09:54.912 --> 02:09:59.666
No, that's an oath.
Those words you gotta back up.

02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:02.836
Yeah, I know that.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.630
I reckon we'll be haulin' her
and the kid with us now.

02:10:07.049 --> 02:10:08.967
Where to?

02:10:09.051 --> 02:10:11.970
I don't know.
What do you think of California?

02:10:14.223 --> 02:10:16.308
Boy, what is you doin'?

02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:19.895
What am I doin'? Have you gone blind?
I'm goin' to sleep, Holt.

02:10:19.979 --> 02:10:22.856
I'm fixin' to get me some sleep.

02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:24.858
Roedel, I gotta tell you this?

02:10:24.942 --> 02:10:27.027
Tell me what?

02:10:27.111 --> 02:10:29.613
[Chuckling]

02:10:29.697 --> 02:10:32.365
You're supposed to sleep
with the wife, Roedel.

02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:34.659
Great day in the morning,
you got to know that much.

02:10:34.744 --> 02:10:36.453
You're supposed to share her bed.

02:10:36.537 --> 02:10:39.247
That way, if some other man do that,
you shoot him.

02:10:39.332 --> 02:10:41.458
Yeah, I know all that.
You bet I know that.

02:10:41.542 --> 02:10:45.212
But, hell, this ain't some
regular marriage situation.

02:10:45.296 --> 02:10:48.757
What, you don't like her? You gonna sit up
there and tell me you don't like her?

02:10:50.301 --> 02:10:54.137
I like her.
She's pretty enough and all that.

02:10:54.222 --> 02:10:58.808
It's just this marriage thing
has swept up on me kind of all of the sudden.

02:10:59.894 --> 02:11:04.064
Yeah, well, it is over you, Roedel.

02:11:06.067 --> 02:11:09.986
- I mean to say, you done the milkin'.
- [Boot Drops On Floor]

02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:12.072
You might as well have the cream.

02:11:30.258 --> 02:11:31.800
Jake.

02:11:53.364 --> 02:11:55.448
Hey, take your clothes off.

02:11:55.533 --> 02:11:58.535
You don't come to bed in dirty duds, Jake.

02:11:58.619 --> 02:12:00.620
That's a rule.

02:12:00.705 --> 02:12:03.873
Just how many rules is it
you got for me, girl?

02:12:03.958 --> 02:12:06.376
Don't get mad.

02:12:07.712 --> 02:12:09.963
Here. I'll help you.

02:12:33.404 --> 02:12:35.030
Hmm.

02:12:42.038 --> 02:12:43.955
Are you a virgin?

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.917
I've sinned plenty.

02:12:49.086 --> 02:12:52.631
But have you ever bedded a woman before?

02:12:54.175 --> 02:12:58.136
Girl, I've killed 15 men.

02:12:59.138 --> 02:13:01.348
[Chuckling]

02:13:01.432 --> 02:13:03.350
Come here.

02:13:31.212 --> 02:13:33.463

02:13:47.561 --> 02:13:49.562
[Sighs]

02:13:53.567 --> 02:13:57.904
Roedel, I do a lot for you,
you know that?

02:13:58.906 --> 02:14:00.824
You know I do. It's equal.

02:14:00.908 --> 02:14:03.326
Yeah - Don't say it.
I got a thing to say.

02:14:03.411 --> 02:14:04.661
All right.

02:14:04.745 --> 02:14:09.499
Uh - Look, now I'll travel with you
and yours till we get past...

02:14:09.583 --> 02:14:14.254
them Pin Indians and riffraff in the Nation,
and then I got to go off somewhere.

02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:15.630
Where is that, Holt?

02:14:15.715 --> 02:14:20.093
Well, I ain't decided that
to a definite aim, but I'm goin'.

02:14:25.683 --> 02:14:28.017
I'm goin' to find my mama.

02:14:29.687 --> 02:14:33.189
I believe she was sold to Texas,
so that's where I'll commence to lookin'.

02:14:33.274 --> 02:14:36.526
If she was sold there...

02:14:36.610 --> 02:14:39.362
I'll go there and pay to buy her freedom.

02:14:41.031 --> 02:14:44.451
Holt, you done already
paid more than enough to buy -

02:14:44.535 --> 02:14:46.786
Yeah, I-I hear you sayin' it.

02:14:53.961 --> 02:14:56.880
- I wish you well.
- Well, it ain't yet.

02:14:56.964 --> 02:14:58.965
I ain't leavin' you
till your little narrow Dutch ass...

02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:00.717
is past Pitt Mackeson
and them Pin Indians.

02:15:00.801 --> 02:15:03.636
- Didn't I just through tellin' you that?
- Yeah, you did.

02:15:03.721 --> 02:15:11.311
All right.

02:15:14.482 --> 02:15:16.441
[Scissors Snipping]

02:15:16.525 --> 02:15:18.693

Good-bye, Bushwhacker curls.

02:15:22.323 --> 02:15:25.366
[Snipping Continues]

02:15:27.912 --> 02:15:31.289
There you are, Dutchy.
You look 21 again.

02:15:31.373 --> 02:15:33.625
I'm just now 19, Ort.

02:15:34.919 --> 02:15:37.420
That so?

02:15:37.505 --> 02:15:39.964
Well, you'll never look that young.

02:15:42.092 --> 02:15:45.887
I said I wouldn't cut my hair
till I was finished with the war.

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:47.931
And you didn't, Roedel.

02:15:49.016 --> 02:15:50.600
You didn't.

02:15:53.103 --> 02:15:57.273
Militia find those, you're not likely to get
further than the nearest hangin' tree.

02:15:59.735 --> 02:16:02.821
Ah, hell. Good luck, y'all.

I didn't expect to see you no more.

02:17:25.154 --> 02:17:28.531
Howdy, Pitt. Turner.

Want some chicory?

02:17:35.289 --> 02:17:37.290
I think I will.

02:17:38.375 --> 02:17:40.627

02:18:11.241 --> 02:18:12.909
How are you, Holt?

02:18:13.911 --> 02:18:15.745
Fairly well.

You two alone?

Just us now.
We've been on the run.

02:18:31.303 --> 02:18:33.221
How's Black John?

02:18:33.305 --> 02:18:36.599
That's a big question, Dutchy,
'cause the man is dead.

02:18:37.768 --> 02:18:40.602
Black John is dead.

02:18:40.688 --> 02:18:42.647

They got him at Dover.

02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:47.276
Put his head on a pole.

02:18:48.278 --> 02:18:50.530
Paraded him right down the street.

02:18:51.531 --> 02:18:53.866
Put a picture of it in their paper.

02:18:55.035 --> 02:18:56.952

It's been rough times
for them who stuck it out.

02:19:04.585 --> 02:19:07.171
Yeah, the war is lost.

02:19:07.255 --> 02:19:09.173
No shit, Dutchy.

02:19:11.468 --> 02:19:13.428
Who the gal and kid belong to?

02:19:15.431 --> 02:19:17.014
That's my wife.

[Chuckles]
Well, if that don't beat all.

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:24.313
You got a wife, Dutchy.

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.443
- Where you headed?
- Newport.

02:19:31.572 --> 02:19:35.157
Hell, man.
There's 200 Federals in Newport.

02:19:35.242 --> 02:19:37.910
We just rode through 'em.
You can't go on in there.

02:19:37.995 --> 02:19:41.664
Wrong, Dutchy. I am goin' in there.

02:19:41.749 --> 02:19:45.168
I'm for certain sure goin' in there.

02:19:45.252 --> 02:19:49.380
I want a drink,
and they have drinks in Newport.

02:19:49.465 --> 02:19:52.759
They'll kill you.
You best stay clear out of there.

02:19:52.843 --> 02:19:55.636
I don't think so, Dutchy.

02:19:55.721 --> 02:19:58.598
I don't reckon I'll clear out
of where I was born.

02:19:59.892 --> 02:20:02.351
You see, that there
was my hometown.

02:20:02.436 --> 02:20:05.730
And I reckon I'll go on in
and have me a drink there.

02:20:10.402 --> 02:20:12.820
Turner, you too?

02:20:16.283 --> 02:20:17.867

Are you certain you wanna ride
with your gun like that?

02:22:33.587 --> 02:22:35.504
Let me wake 'em, Holt.

02:22:36.506 --> 02:22:38.758
No, Roedel. You let them sleep.

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:41.886
I ain't too much for good-byes.
