♪♪

00:07.842 --> 00:10.042
I'm just gonna put down
whatever. Ow!

00:10.044 --> 00:13.612
No, our profile on
the Abigail Adams High School
social network

00:13.614 --> 00:16.782
is who we are in
high school and it'll
follow us into college

00:16.784 --> 00:20.152
and into our careers
and into my marriage
and into your five.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.387
Is one Lucas?

00:21.389 --> 00:26.291
No, sorry. But you were married
to Farkle for six weeks.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.061
May he rest in peace.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.363
I'll tell you right now
the boy died happy.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.532
Hmm. Shall we begin?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.234
Name. Maya Penelope Hart.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.370
-Really?
-I've decided to embrace it.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.707
(typing)
"Riley Matthews.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.642
Interests."

00:43.644 --> 00:46.678
-Why'd you stop?
-I can't think of my interests.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.882
You can think of your interests.
You're just worried that your
interests aren't interesting

00:49.884 --> 00:52.017
and your profile will
bore the whole school.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.019
Why are you only smart
when it's at me?

00:54.021 --> 00:56.355
Just skip it and go
to the ones you know.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.856
-Like favorite movie.
-No.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.558
-Why?
-Maya, what if people here

00:59.560 --> 01:03.062
don't share my passion
for farm animals
who save the day?

01:03.064 --> 01:06.331
-Why do you care about
what other people think?
-That's all I do.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.667
Riley, just write down
something you like
and stop being so dramatic.

01:08.669 --> 01:13.005
Okay, I am the least dramatic
person who has ever roamed
the face of the Earth.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.407
What did you put
for favorite movie?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.242
<i>Don't Look Behind You.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:19.378
-Did I see that with you?
-No.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.380
-Why not?
-Look behind you.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.382
(screams)

01:23.384 --> 01:25.084
That's why.

01:25.086 --> 01:29.721
Well, I'm sure that nobody
else knows what to write
down, either.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.524
-Oh,<i> Butch Cassidy.</i>
<i>-Empire Strikes Back.</i>

01:32.526 --> 01:35.461
<i>The Notebook.</i>

01:36.630 --> 01:38.730
Love never dies, man.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.200
All right, favorite song?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.234
Ooh, "Desperado."

01:42.236 --> 01:44.369
Anything by Céline Dion.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.374
The sound of my computer
turning on.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.610
(imitates computer chime)

01:51.612 --> 01:53.312
This is so easy.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.081
Why is this so hard for you?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.117
When one makes a decision,
one must consider

01:58.119 --> 01:59.485
the consequences
of one's choice.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.287
-Real talk.
-What if nobody likes me?

02:02.289 --> 02:05.157
You're just freaking out
because your name's on it.

02:05.159 --> 02:08.460
Let's pretend that you had
an alter ego you pretended
to be when you were all alone

02:08.462 --> 02:11.230
that nobody knows about
and put her name on it.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.766
Yes. Let's pretend that.
Ha ha.

02:14.768 --> 02:18.670
-What's her name?
-Jexica.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.739
Jexica?

02:20.741 --> 02:24.309
Like Jessica, but "x-ier."

02:24.311 --> 02:27.279
Nobody's gonna find
that adorable.

02:27.281 --> 02:30.315
Jexica was the coolest thing
there ever was.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.418
She had blue hair
and she protected me.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.921
-What happened to her?
-You showed up.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.191
Both: Aww!

02:39.193 --> 02:41.093
So make a profile as Jexica.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.928
Write down all the answers
as yourself,

02:42.930 --> 02:45.464
but if nobody likes her,
you're fine because nobody
knows it's you.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.967
Okay. Ha, this already
feels easier.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.370
Pretending to be somebody else
usually is.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.372
Jexica likes all of the things
that I like

02:53.374 --> 02:56.708
except she wears
a green army jacket,

02:56.710 --> 03:00.345
has feathers in her blue hair
and she carries a sword.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.114
Classic Jexica.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.352
Hey, that's her.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.154
You think anybody
will like her?

03:09.156 --> 03:11.557
I know I do.

I hate not having

as you.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.725
I know. I turned to talk
to you in class to tell you
about this little dry patch

04:19.727 --> 04:21.526
and realized I was talking
to Yogi.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.263
Hey, you try that
eucalyptus, girl?

04:24.265 --> 04:25.464
Thanks, Yogs.

04:30.571 --> 04:34.573
Why are you laughing?
Is one of my five husbands Yogi?

04:34.575 --> 04:37.576
-How is that possible?
-We only know five guys.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.212
You check your phone recently?

04:40.214 --> 04:43.115
Ooh! Jexica has 20 likes.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.118
-Refresh.
-Jexica has 200 likes.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.620
-Refresh.
-What's going on?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.957
-Jexica is super popular.
-People really love her.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.558
Look at the comments.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.829
Jexica says
everything I'm thinking.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.767
Jexica makes me
less afraid to be me.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.936
I went to summer camp with her.

05:04.938 --> 05:09.608
Jexica's my best friend.
She's always been
my best friend.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.942
She has.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.011
Now Jexica was a success.

05:13.013 --> 05:17.649
So delete Jexica and put up your
real profile and let everybody
like you before it's too late.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.752
Hey, guys, how do you
feel about making some new
friends outside our group?

05:20.754 --> 05:21.853
Of course. Why?

05:21.855 --> 05:23.789
-Uh, there's this girl...
-What?

05:23.791 --> 05:26.825
-named Jexica.
-What?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.194
-Delete her.
-Too late.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.530
I don't know. I just feel
like I really get Jexica.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.933
Yeah, she's a mystery woman.
A mystery makes a woman
very intriguing.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.601
I went to summer camp
with her.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.805
It looks as though
we all like her.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.373
-Better than Maya?
-Hey!

05:41.375 --> 05:45.344
I'm sorry. Better than Maya?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.518
I'm rich.
I'm rich I tell ya.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.987
More info please.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.623
-No.
-No?

05:58.625 --> 06:01.026
If you don't just take
my word for it,

06:01.028 --> 06:05.030
then I'm only gonna share
my $30 million U.S. with mommy.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.632
Ooh!

06:07.634 --> 06:10.736
-All right, read it.
-"I am Prince Baji
from Nairobi."

06:10.738 --> 06:13.372
-Oh.
-Scam.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.708
No scam. Says right here.
"This no scam."

06:17.711 --> 06:19.745
-Auggie--
-You taught me to read.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.882
Why would you teach me to read
if I wasn't supposed to believe
what I'm reading?

06:25.219 --> 06:27.586
He's got us, Topanga.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.589
And if it was a scam,
why would they start by saying,

06:30.591 --> 06:33.392
"Hello, it's me,
your friend from Nairobi?"

06:33.394 --> 06:35.394
Do you have a friend
from Nairobi?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.562
Well, we're in the early stages
of our relationship,

06:37.564 --> 06:41.700
and he wants to give me money
so I'd say we're besties.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.703
Honey, they don't even
have a real identity.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.204
They're just trying
to gain your trust.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.775
I do trust Prince Baji.
He does so have an identity.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.243
He sent me his picture.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.145
That's Morgan Freeman.

06:54.882 --> 06:58.383
It's always Morgan Freeman.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.887
How can you not
trust that face?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.556
-Topanga.
-No.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.192
Look at this picture
and tell me this isn't
the real Prince Baji.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.296
I don't want him to lose
his boyish innocence.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.231
The world is the world, Cory.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.601
I want to protect him
for as long as we can, okay?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.804
He has to learn
what's out there sometime.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.773
What's out there?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.876
Okay, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we say what we really
think on the count of three?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.812
-Ready?
-Both: One, two, three!

07:26.814 --> 07:29.948
I think he's gonna be
King Baji one day and I think
we should get in now.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.553
(laughing) Wow.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.921
What are you writing?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.756
Happy anniversary, Topanga.

07:37.758 --> 07:41.760
Because that is the 100th
time that you have one,
two, three, tricked me.

07:41.762 --> 07:45.497
-I do it that often?
-You've been doing it
since the '90s.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.266
All right,
on the count of three.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.136
-Both: One, two, three!
-Angela's still in love
with Shawn.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.737
I hate that.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.074
It's not my fault you fall
for it all the time.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.143
And I can't believe
you keep a list of it.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.279
You can't imagine the lists
I have on you.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.948
Do you have any on me?

08:02.950 --> 08:06.017
Oh, do I have any lists on you?
Let me think about it. No.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.654
-Why not?
-Because I'm a healthy person.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.189
Well, I hate that, too.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.192
-(sighs)
-He okay?

08:14.194 --> 08:16.161
Oh, he's fine, honey.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.898
I believe you.
I believe anything.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.774
I hear the freshmen just joined
the high school social network.

08:29.776 --> 08:33.445
-Not me.
-I hear someone has already
caused quite a stir.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.880
Not me.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.449
So who is ready
to learn something today?

08:37.451 --> 08:39.451
Not me.

08:39.453 --> 08:43.855
A social network is something
that has its roots firmly
planted in our history.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.992
Cave paintings, stone tablets,
scrolls and papyrus leaves,

08:46.994 --> 08:50.228
they all help decode
what went on in a society.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.398
Now what are historians
in the future gonna use
to help determine who we were?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.834
The Internet
and my frozen brain.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.537
If they look at the Internet,
they're gonna think we're
pretty ridiculous.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.405
You think? Why is that?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.741
Because the Internet makes us
look like a society of people

09:02.743 --> 09:06.678
-that only care
about dancing cats.
-But we're more than that.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.715
We are, but no one knows that
if the dancing cat videos
have a billion views

09:10.717 --> 09:13.718
and the discovery
of a new planet only
gets 27,000 likes.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.554
All me.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.989
What's the difference?
Dancing cats and a new planet

09:17.991 --> 09:19.925
are just gonna get replaced
by something new tomorrow.

09:19.927 --> 09:24.029
Exactly right, Mr. Friar.
So what does that say about us?

09:24.031 --> 09:27.232
Oh, Oh! I know. It's not that
we're a society of dancing cats.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.935
It's that we're a society of--
Yes, Matthews?

09:31.838 --> 09:35.740
It says that we're a society
that lets things rise and fall
that have no real value

09:35.742 --> 09:37.742
because the Internet makes them
so readily available to us

09:37.744 --> 09:40.245
so they get a lot of clicks
and likes and comments,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.747
and then they fade out of our
mind when the next thing
comes along.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.916
Well, what's wrong
with a little distraction?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.918
Nothing, if that's all it is.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.287
How many people here have seen
the dancing cats video?

09:50.223 --> 09:52.357
What about the sneezing panda?

09:52.359 --> 09:55.694
'Cause it goes, "Achoo!"
and the other one goes, "Ah"!

09:58.231 --> 10:03.034
It seems to me this isn't
a distraction at all.
It's a lifestyle.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.370
Yeah, but we use the Internet
to study as well, Mr. Matthews.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.773
And that's great.
Okay, so who here knows
the capital of Minnesota?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.144
What about penguins?
Are they in the North Pole?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.113
Polar bears at the South
or is it the other way around?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.617
We only have so much room
in our brains.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.753
Really? Who has seen
the "Charlie bit my finger--"

10:21.755 --> 10:26.591
All: "Charlie bit my finger.
He bit my finger, Charlie."

10:26.593 --> 10:29.961
(laughing) Oh, Charlie.

10:29.963 --> 10:34.165
Okay, I guarantee you guys

10:34.167 --> 10:38.603
that what historians will say
about us is that we're a society
that spent a lot of time

10:38.605 --> 10:41.406
with a click or a like
or a comment.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.975
And it's especially easy
if nobody knows who you are,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.911
because a lot of people
spend their time posting
under anonymous names.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.113
Is that a good thing
or bad thing?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.849
-Good.
-Good. Why good?

10:50.851 --> 10:53.284
Just good.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.921
-Just why?
-Because maybe life
is easier that way.

10:56.923 --> 11:00.258
Maybe. Or maybe hiding
behind a fake screenname

11:00.260 --> 11:02.327
gives the people the courage
to go negative.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.597
Or someone who's too scared
to express themselves

11:05.599 --> 11:07.966
an undeserved moment
of attention.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.534
<i>(chiming)</i>

11:09.536 --> 11:11.603
Man:
<i>Attention, Abigail Adams High.</i>

11:11.605 --> 11:16.207
<i>Will Jexica please report</i>
<i>to the school office? Jexica.</i>

11:16.209 --> 11:18.543
<i>We just really want</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

11:27.454 --> 11:30.321
I'm alone in the bay window.

11:30.323 --> 11:34.492
I've been forsaken,
abandoned

11:34.494 --> 11:38.329
and a third word for alone.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.366
I'm almost done liking
the likes that people
liked of me.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.234
-You mean Jexica.
-I am Jexica.

11:43.236 --> 11:47.172
I have achieved stunning
and unheard of popularity.
I have everything I want.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.140
It's only because
nobody knows it's you.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.743
And that would bother
some people, but not me.

11:51.745 --> 11:55.080
Because I'm too busy
answering everybody's
private requests for advice.

11:55.082 --> 11:59.250
-Here's a new message. Oh.
-What?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.985
-Nothing.
-Read that one right now.

12:00.987 --> 12:05.023
Or what? (screams)

12:05.025 --> 12:07.759
"Hi, Jexica,
my name is Lucas Friar"--

12:07.761 --> 12:09.561
Wait. Why would Lucas
write to Jexica?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.830
"I have to choose
between two girls.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.100
And I thought that I liked them
both, but what I really love is
that you want to ride unicorns

12:15.102 --> 12:18.169
while eating cotton candy
and collecting falling stars.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.105
I think you would fit in
with our group of friends,

12:20.107 --> 12:22.107
but please don't tell
them I invited you."

12:22.109 --> 12:24.909
-He knows.
-No, he doesn't know, Maya.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.946
I wish everybody knew because
then I'd be the most popular
girl in school,

12:27.948 --> 12:32.951
but I'm not
because nobody knows.
Isn't that just the way?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.552
He knows it's you.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.021
He doesn't know,
but if he knew, it would
fix all of our problems.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.091
-How?
-Because if Lucas likes Jexica

12:40.093 --> 12:41.960
then he doesn't have to choose
between you and me,

12:41.962 --> 12:45.130
and we don't get hurt
and he can have Jexica,
and we don't get hurt.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.633
What'd I do? I land on
your head? Is that what I did?
I land on your head?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.040
I know what I must do.

12:56.042 --> 12:59.043
That's nice. I'll wait here.
Oh, look, she's marching.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.588
It's me, Maya.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.658
I know who it is, nimrod.
Why does everything always
have to get so out of hand?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.927
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.830
Here's my plan. "A"--
I go to school like this.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.632
"B"-- I claim
my new popularity.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.902
"C"-- I solve our whole
love triangle when Lucas
falls for Jexica.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.805
-Not a thing.
-"D"-- something goes
horribly wrong.

13:26.807 --> 13:31.743
"E"-- I learn a big lesson.
Let's go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

13:33.647 --> 13:36.147
What can I say?
This sounds right.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.319
Breakfast is served.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.188
You cooked for us?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.590
Why, yes, August, I did.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.959
And not because Mommy one,
two, three, tricked me,

13:47.961 --> 13:50.428
but I did it out
of the generosity
in my own heart,

13:50.430 --> 13:53.264
just like Prince Baji does.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.800
Oh, hey,
I just thought of something.

13:55.802 --> 14:00.271
Would it be okay with you
if we didn't raise our son
to be an Internet sucker?

14:00.273 --> 14:03.708
Why, yes, it would be
as long as it would be
okay with you that we did.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.678
Why?

14:06.680 --> 14:11.015
Because sometimes it's okay
to believe in the world.
Prove me wrong, I dare ya.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.117
-Prove me wrong.
<i>-(chiming)</i>

14:13.119 --> 14:17.121
-What?
-It's from Ava.
She's in London.

14:17.123 --> 14:21.759
She's lost her wallet.
She needs me to send her
all the money I have.

14:23.797 --> 14:26.898
Okay, you guys don't want me
to trust strangers,

14:26.900 --> 14:29.200
but you've always taught me
to help my friends.

14:29.202 --> 14:33.037
And Ava's my friend
and I'm gonna help her
no matter what.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.143
Prove me wrong, I dare ya.
Prove me wrong!

14:41.715 --> 14:44.249
-What?
-That is the 100th anniversary

14:44.251 --> 14:47.185
of "Prove Me Wrong, I Dare Ya.
Prove Me Wrong."

14:47.187 --> 14:50.755
It's also the 100th anniversary
of "Why Did I Marry You"?

14:50.757 --> 14:53.558
Ooh, congratulations.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.839
Attention. Attention,
everyone in the school.

15:07.841 --> 15:12.410
I have an announcement to make.
I am Jexica!

15:13.680 --> 15:16.447
-That oughta do it.
-You would think, but no.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.751
-Why not, pray tell?
-What we've done is
skipped right to "D."

15:19.753 --> 15:23.888
A, B, C-- D!
this is the letter where
everything goes horribly wrong.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.256
That's the one.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.193
I am Jexica.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.197
I am Jexica.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.200
I am Jexica.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.503
-Yogi?
-Jexica.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.206
All: I am Jexica!

15:42.208 --> 15:45.109
What do we do now?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.644
Too early to tell.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.881
We'll be back right after
this with our lesson.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.053
Maya:
<i>And now it's one day later.</i>

15:55.055 --> 15:56.654
<i>What could have</i>
<i>possibly changed?</i>

15:56.656 --> 16:01.626
I know I said I liked
her yesterday, but that
was yesterday. Come on.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.395
Yeah, it's possible that I said
I was Jexica

16:04.397 --> 16:09.100
to show I could be
a unique individual
just like her.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.502
I don't wanna be mean,
but I'm gonna.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.805
I think the blue hair
and sword may be trying
too hard.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.107
I've tried to tell her,
but you know Jexica.

16:16.109 --> 16:20.411
She's still my best friend
and everything. She is.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.081
<i>-(music playing)</i>
-Hey, guys, have you seen
a piano playing rabbit?

16:36.796 --> 16:40.298
Maya, I don't get it.
Jexica has lost, like,
half of her followers.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.501
How could this happen?
What did I do?
What kind of world is this?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.603
You didn't do anything wrong,
Riles. It's just a matter
of time

16:45.605 --> 16:48.306
before people get over
something that doesn't
actually exist.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.841
Poor Jexica.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.209
She's not a thing.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.212
-All she ever wanted was love.
-She doesn't exist.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.280
I bet she wishes she never
even put up her own profile.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.217
-She's you.
-Well, then how do
I feel about this?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.486
Leave me alone.

17:01.488 --> 17:06.024
Okay, historians will decide
whatever they decide about us.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.359
How do you guys feel
about who you are?

17:08.361 --> 17:11.362
I got 109 followers.
So I feel pretty good
no matter what happens.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.699
Really? What's valuable?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.701
Polar bears, North Pole.
Penguins, South Pole.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.369
The capital of Minnesota
is St. Paul.

17:18.371 --> 17:23.307
That's right, that's great,
right? Isn't that great?

17:23.309 --> 17:26.811
-"Charlie bit my finger."
-Everyone: "Charlie
bit my finger.

17:26.813 --> 17:30.915
Charlie bit my finger.
Oh, Charlie."

17:30.917 --> 17:35.753
If something that's important
to us today is so easily
replaced

17:35.755 --> 17:40.391
by something else tomorrow,
we have to wonder if it ever
really had any value at all.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.093
What can we learn from that?

17:42.095 --> 17:45.763
-I don't know.
-How do you not know?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.899
I don't know because I live
in a world that judges me

17:47.901 --> 17:50.234
based on whatever movie
or song I like,

17:50.236 --> 17:53.438
and I'm expected to answer
questions about myself,

17:53.440 --> 17:55.940
but I'm still figuring out
who I am

17:55.942 --> 17:57.942
and everything
could change tomorrow.

17:57.944 --> 18:02.180
Because who you are isn't
measured by today or tomorrow,

18:02.182 --> 18:04.949
but by a whole bunch of days
of what you do.

18:04.951 --> 18:09.754
Not necessarily what you like
or what you say at
a particular time.

18:09.756 --> 18:14.125
The great thing about evolving
is that we continue
to grow and feel.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.898
Don't be influenced by
somebody else's likes
or clicks or favorites.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.434
Who should determine
what you think?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.370
Wikipedia.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.573
You disgust me.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.609
Go figure this out
in the bay window.
Class is over!

18:39.252 --> 18:40.818
-Hey, Huckleberry.
-Yes.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.821
-What do you know?
-I know a lot of things.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.790
I know that we need
to stick together.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.493
I know that the only way we
can do that is if we're
honest with each other.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.130
-Get to it.
-I know that you are Jexica.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.432
I know that you are Jexica.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.468
Lucas told me that
you are Jexica.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.504
How did you guys know that?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.672
We know who you are, Riley.
You don't have to write down

19:01.674 --> 19:05.343
some fake profile for us
to know who you are.
I'd recognize you anywhere.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.679
What? No, you said something
to her so now you have to look
at me and say something to me.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.682
-I'd recognize
you anywhere, too.
-You're not even trying.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.853
I'm tired all the time.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.588
-Guys.
-Yes.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.658
-I want us to last forever.
-Well, how do we do that?

19:20.660 --> 19:25.096
By finding out that friends
who know who you are

19:25.098 --> 19:27.265
is the most
real thing there is.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.868
So, Riley, what are you
gonna put on your profile?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.504
Yeah. Who are you?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.610
Topanga.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.213
I've been thinking about
you all day and I want
to tell you something.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.348
I've been thinking about
you all day and I want
to tell you something.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.017
Let's say it on the count
of three.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.685
-Absolutely.
-Both: One, two, three!

19:47.687 --> 19:50.555
I don't want you to
have a list of anything
I do that you don't like.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.190
I tricked you, I won,
and I feel good about it.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.525
But I don't ever want
to do it again,

19:54.527 --> 19:57.528
and I'd like to forget
about the 100 times
that I did. Is that okay?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.665
Tell her it's okay, Dad.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.368
No, it's not okay.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.803
I'm giving you a chance
to start over.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.906
I wouldn't change one moment
of anything we ever did.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.343
That's pretty good, huh?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.112
Yeah, that's real good.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.484
-Auggie, where were you?
-What?

20:20.486 --> 20:23.487
I e-mailed you.
I told you to come to London.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.023
You left me hangin', baby.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.694
That was real?
Why were you in London?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.597
I had to stop there
on my way back from Nairobi.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.665
You saw Prince Baji?

20:34.667 --> 20:38.869
You mean the Baj?
He gave me this.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.573
$30 million, U.S.?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.343
How do you like me now, Topy?

20:45.345 --> 20:47.545
Oh, call me "Mommy."

20:47.547 --> 20:49.747
All: Yay!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.482
Yay!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.987
That was a good one.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.962
Step away from the Internet.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.466
I finally made
my own profile.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.135
I put down all
of my favorites.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.871
I put down everything
that makes me who I am.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.474
Hey, I know you.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.410
Good. Let's watch this now.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.612
Woman:
<i>And who is your best friend?</i>

21:21.614 --> 21:24.649
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>

21:24.651 --> 21:27.618
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>

21:27.620 --> 21:29.987
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>
<i>Pizza?</i>

21:29.989 --> 21:33.024
(laughing)
