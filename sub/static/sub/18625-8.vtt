-[owl hooting]

00:48.423 --> 00:51.301
[heavy breathing]

00:51.385 --> 00:53.262
[grunting]

00:53.345 --> 00:56.014
[panting, laughing]

01:00.936 --> 01:03.522
-[mobile playing soft music]
-Aw...

01:04.313 --> 01:06.567
[baby cooing]

01:06.650 --> 01:10.654
Ooh! Chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.032
Check that baby out.

01:14.116 --> 01:18.704
[exhales]
Vespa 300 GTS Super.

01:18.787 --> 01:24.418
Single-cylinder catalyzed
four-stroke Quasar engine. Hmm...

01:24.501 --> 01:26.837
Can you imagine me
going down the road on that?

01:26.920 --> 01:30.966
Wind whipping through my hair,
Claire holding tight to my back...

01:31.049 --> 01:33.844
Me, cruising in the sidecar next to ya.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.639
Oh. You imagined
you and Claire alone, didn't you?

01:37.723 --> 01:38.849
[sighs]

01:38.932 --> 01:40.851
What are the chances of your mom
getting you one for your birthday?

01:40.934 --> 01:44.229
Only slightly worse than me winning
the lottery and buying it myself.

01:44.313 --> 01:48.150
-How much you got saved?
-Only 328 bucks and 32 cents.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.236
[scoffs] By the time I have enough,
these things will drive themselves.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.113
[gasps]
Do you see that?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.241
-[baby cooing]
-[grunting]

01:56.325 --> 01:58.410
-Goblin!
-What?

01:58.493 --> 02:01.997
-It's a goblin, with a baby!
-Come on, Jim! It's just a bird!

02:02.080 --> 02:05.083
[goblin laughing]

02:11.381 --> 02:13.675
Chill out, man! This trollhunting
is making you hallucinate!

02:13.759 --> 02:16.011
I mean, what would a goblin want
with a baby?

02:16.094 --> 02:19.640
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.935
[grunts]
Let me get this straight.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.146
-[gears turning]
-[screams]

02:26.230 --> 02:27.481
Hoo!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.107
They steal babies...

02:29.983 --> 02:31.235
so they can replace them...

02:32.152 --> 02:33.153
with changelings?

02:33.237 --> 02:35.072
Precisely, Master Jim.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.991
Uh, allegedly steal. I just saw a bird.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.578
And, in order for a changeling
to maintain its appearance in our world,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.831
no harm must come
to the human child in theirs.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.749
I assure you,

02:45.832 --> 02:50.462
there is no safer place for a baby to be
than the bowels of the Darklands nursery.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.048
[gasps]
Well, that's good to know!

02:53.131 --> 02:56.927
Whoa! Hold on, there. Okay, suppose
they did take the baby to the Darklands.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.263
Isn't that where Gunmar
is trying to escape from?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.223
The doorway to his realm
is sealed for now,

03:01.306 --> 03:05.310
but it doesn't exonerate the cracks
that inevitably form over time.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.355
Cracks that allow small things to pass.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.358
Small, like babies and goblins.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.694
So, if we can find out
whose baby was stolen,

03:13.777 --> 03:16.154
we'll find a changeling
in its place, right?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.406
-[gears turning]
-[gasps]

03:18.240 --> 03:21.618
[grunts]
And once we have the changeling,

03:21.702 --> 03:24.037
we'll have the proof
to finally convince Vendel--

03:24.121 --> 03:25.163
[screaming]

03:25.247 --> 03:27.374
-Jim!
-No!

03:27.457 --> 03:29.626
-[grunts]
-Got him!

03:30.961 --> 03:33.172
[grunting]

03:33.255 --> 03:36.341
-I told you I'd fall.
-You fell because you knew you could.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.051
What if you're endangered
and we aren't there?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.345
Next time, we'll climb
sans the safety line.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.263
We'll?

03:41.346 --> 03:44.266
The only lesson learned here today
is that, with this many changelings,

03:44.349 --> 03:48.103
Arcadia is far more dangerous than
previously thought, for the both of you.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.564
As Jim has Draal now to protect his home,

03:50.647 --> 03:53.442
Tobias, you will now have Aaarrrgghh
to protect yours.

03:53.525 --> 03:57.863
Really? For real? We're gonna be roomies?
Yeah! High-five, big guy!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.364
[screaming]

03:59.448 --> 04:00.824
[squeaks]

04:00.908 --> 04:03.952
Ugh! You're still carrying
that germ-infested thing around?

04:04.036 --> 04:07.414
I am going to find out who it belongs to,
and when I do--

04:07.497 --> 04:09.374
Maybe you didn't see
what you thought you saw.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.126
You've been spending
so much time in Trollmarket.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.921
Maybe your mind
is starting to play tricks on you.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.882
-Maybe you're right.
-You have Suzy Snooze?

04:16.964 --> 04:19.843
My brother's bunny!
I've been looking all over for him.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.262
-You've been looking for this?
-Yeah.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.848
He's been acting so weird without it.
Where did you get it?

04:24.932 --> 04:28.101
What do you mean, he hasn't been himself?
Exactly how has he been acting?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.230
Easy, Jim! [chuckles]
Always concerned about the children.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.857
But just for clarification,
are we super sure this is his?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.068
I mean, you could probably
pick this up at, like, any store.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.362
I think I'd know the stuffed bunny
I grew up with.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.990
Claire, I'm so sorry,
but I can't babysit tonight.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.910
-I can't. I really can't!
-You promised!

04:44.993 --> 04:48.163
My parents have a work thing
and the Papa Skull concert's tonight.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.625
Papa Skull!
I, like, live in their shirt every day!

04:51.708 --> 04:55.003
Sorry, but Dean finally
asked me to a movie,

04:55.087 --> 04:57.464
and then Hank invited me to ice cream!

04:57.548 --> 04:59.132
"Tight jeans" Hank!

04:59.216 --> 05:01.385
Love can't choose, Claire!

05:01.468 --> 05:05.514
-Do you believe this?
-I know. Mary Wang's a player?

05:05.597 --> 05:11.228
No! She doesn't know her brother's gone
because Claire's brother is a changeling.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.479
Claire, I can babysit!

05:12.563 --> 05:16.567
Tonight? Really? You would?
Wait, have you ever babysat before?

05:16.650 --> 05:21.280
Uh, yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, no.
They call me "Jim the Baby-handed."

05:21.363 --> 05:24.449
Oh, my gosh! You are a life-saver!
I could kiss you!

05:25.909 --> 05:29.538
Just come by my house at seven,
no sooner. Thank you, Jim. Thank you.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.374
-He's not a changeling, Jim.
-Only one way to find out.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.797
Nana, I'm home! It's your Toby-Pie!

05:40.674 --> 05:43.051
I have a giant troll with me!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.599
All right, big guy.
Coast is clear. Let's go.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.602
-Nana?
-Don't worry, big guy. You'll love her.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.563
As long as she never sees you,
which she won't. She's legally blind.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.940
[moans]

05:57.024 --> 06:00.819
Also, Nana's not really big on stairs.
She maybe comes up once a month to clean.

06:00.903 --> 06:03.071
The entire upper floor
is pretty much ours.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.531
Oh! Sorry.

06:04.615 --> 06:09.161
Blinky was totally right. I totally need
a troll bodyguard. A troll-guard!

06:09.244 --> 06:10.704
[grunting]

06:10.787 --> 06:14.166
And this is my-- [clears throat]
excuse me-- <i>our</i> room.

06:14.249 --> 06:18.086
We got everything.
Rock collection, video games, movies.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.632
-[humming]
-Hmm?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.051
And this is where the magic happens.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.971
I got the vanishing coin,
classic rope trick, the floating ball--

06:28.055 --> 06:30.057
-Ladies love the floating ball.
-Huh?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.601
[ball humming]

06:32.684 --> 06:35.187
-Oh!
-[gasps, groans]

06:35.270 --> 06:36.188
[angry chattering]

06:36.271 --> 06:40.442
-Mm... blood magic?
-No, no. It's just a trick, see? For fun.

06:40.526 --> 06:44.613
[angry chattering]

06:44.696 --> 06:47.032
[angry yelling]

06:47.824 --> 06:50.619
I know it's a little cozy,
but that's part of the charm.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.746
So, what do you think, roomie?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.499
[groaning]

06:55.582 --> 06:58.043
I get it. This place cramps your style.

06:58.126 --> 07:02.464
[sighs] I guess I was just excited
to have a roomie, you know?

07:03.966 --> 07:06.802
It's just been me and Nana here
for a while.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.720
[sighs]

07:08.804 --> 07:10.222
Oh...

07:10.931 --> 07:12.474
[moaning]

07:12.558 --> 07:14.810
[ball humming]

07:15.602 --> 07:17.229
More magic?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.231
[chuckles]
Thought you'd never ask!

07:27.155 --> 07:30.784
-[knocking on door] Hey, Claire!
-Jim! [chuckles] Come on in.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.911
I put his routine up on the fridge.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.914
After playtime, you just have
to put him down. He's a good sleeper.

07:35.998 --> 07:39.251
-On the fridge. No problemo.
-Phone numbers are here for emergencies.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.337
Whatever you do,
do not call my parents first.

07:42.421 --> 07:45.257
Oh, because they don't know
you're going to the concert, do they?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.092
You're not the only one hiding a secret.

07:47.176 --> 07:51.096
So, if your secret is eating babies,
now is the time to tell me.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.015
[chuckles]

07:53.098 --> 07:55.559
Hm, good enough for me.
Oh, there's my ride.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.187
Don't worry. He's buckled in good.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.440
Besides, he'd rather play
with his food than eat it.

08:01.523 --> 08:05.027
My parents are at some kind of fundraiser,
so they won't be back until "late" late.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.071
I'll be two or three hours max.
What else am I forgetting?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.866
He loves games. Peek-a-boo,
hide-and-seek. What else?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.868
I've got this. Enjoy the concert.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.454
And help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.873
-[horn honking]
-I'm coming! Sheesh-kebab!

08:19.374 --> 08:20.209
What?

08:21.376 --> 08:25.714
-What's up, my Juliet?
-You're going with him?

08:25.797 --> 08:30.552
-He, um, bought the last tickets.
-Like my ride, buttsnack?

08:30.636 --> 08:35.724
Last on the showroom floor.
Handles like a dream. No big deal.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.019
-[laughing]
-Thanks again, Jim! You're my hero!

08:39.102 --> 08:40.895
[Steve chuckles]
Buttsnack!

08:42.981 --> 08:44.858
-[cooing]
-I'll give you this much.

08:44.942 --> 08:50.781
You seem a little too adorable
and drooly to be a changeling.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.658
Hey, are you now,

08:52.741 --> 08:57.371
or have you ever been
a shape-shifting troll-creature?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.580
[cooing]

08:59.456 --> 09:00.916
[chuckles]

09:00.999 --> 09:04.419
Oh, man, what was I thinking?
You're no monster.

09:04.503 --> 09:07.422
But just in case...
want to play the horseshoe game?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.968
Huh. That's weird. It was just here.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.136
[cooing]

09:13.220 --> 09:17.391
Wait a minute.
You were buckled in a minute ago.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.812
This is supposed to be childproof.
Where did you hide it? Speak.

09:24.356 --> 09:27.317
Oh, you want to play games, do you?

09:27.401 --> 09:28.861
Then let's play.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.739
[gun firing in game]

09:32.823 --> 09:37.286
-[man in game] <i>Fire at will!</i>
-Eat a grenade, scuzzweed! Ba-boom!

09:37.369 --> 09:41.540
[grunts] Oh, no! I'm drawing enemy fire!
Go get the laser sword! Now, Aaarrrgghh!

09:41.623 --> 09:44.334
-Where are you, wingman?
-Wingman?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.963
My partner, my <i>compadre</i>,
my comrade in virtual arms.

09:48.046 --> 09:51.925
We've got to work together, wingman,
to kill the cyber ninjas.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.177
Kill?

09:53.260 --> 09:56.180
<i>-Get to the tower!</i>
<i>-Reload, reload!</i>

09:56.847 --> 10:01.351
Kill them all, kill them all.
Kill them all!

10:01.435 --> 10:04.188
<i>Locked and loaded! Move! Retreat!</i>

10:04.271 --> 10:06.481
-<i>Retreat! My leg!</i>
-[Toby] Kill them all!

10:07.566 --> 10:13.405
[in slow-motion]
Kill... them... all!

10:15.240 --> 10:18.744
[panting]

10:18.827 --> 10:21.371
[growling]

10:21.455 --> 10:22.915
[roars]

10:24.458 --> 10:30.005
[breathing heavily]

10:30.088 --> 10:32.633
-Okay, we can pause it.
-[game beeps]

10:35.677 --> 10:37.471
[whimpering]

10:38.597 --> 10:43.602
Wow. When you get into a game,
man, you really, um... commit.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.772
I'm sorry.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.901
Pacifist, pacifist, pacifist.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.110
[moans]

10:52.194 --> 10:55.948
No, hey, hey! It's cool, dude.
Is something wrong?

10:56.031 --> 11:00.118
Come on, I'm your wingman.
Look, I get it. You get angry.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.956
Everybody gets angry.
Is that why you're a pacifist?

11:04.039 --> 11:06.208
I should go.

11:07.209 --> 11:10.629
You know what I think? This game's lame.
How about we play something else?

11:11.380 --> 11:14.132
I've got Bubble Buddies,
or maybe Go-Go Sushi.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.261
You have to dodge sushi as you're
serving hungry tourists. It's awesome.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.888
And the best part is,
we're on the same team.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.015
[traditional Japanese music playing]

11:22.099 --> 11:24.393
Oh, no! I'm drawing spicy tuna fire!

11:24.476 --> 11:26.854
You gotta ask for tips, wingman!
Ask for tips!

11:26.937 --> 11:30.774
[chuckles]
Sushi.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.235
-[ringtone playing]
-Shrimp. [chuckles]

11:33.318 --> 11:35.904
What's up, Jimbo?
Everything okay with Enrique?

11:35.988 --> 11:39.616
-[Jim] <i>I sort of just lost it.</i>
-What do you mean, you lost it?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.577
<i>No! What in the world?</i>

11:41.660 --> 11:44.788
You don't happen to have
another gaggletack, do you?

11:45.581 --> 11:46.999
[giggling]

11:47.082 --> 11:50.294
You hid the horseshoe
in the diaper bin, didn't you?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.253
[cooing]

11:51.336 --> 11:55.966
Because you're just a normal baby,
and that's what normal babies do.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.136
Ooh, doggy! Oh, it is really packed.

[grunting]

12:01.930 --> 12:02.848
[gasps]

12:02.931 --> 12:05.475
Enrique? Enrique!

12:09.980 --> 12:12.191
Uh, excuse me, uh, Mr. RotGut.

12:12.274 --> 12:17.946
It is with great respect that we return
to you to ask for another gaggletack.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.656
Go away. We're closed.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.784
You haven't closed your apothecary
since the wart outbreak of 1982!

12:22.868 --> 12:26.038
I urge you, if we do not acquire one
at this very moment,

12:26.121 --> 12:30.417
we may be dealing with an exigency
that could shut you down indefinitely.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.420
What's an exigency? Should I be scared?

12:33.504 --> 12:34.588
Indeed.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.758
It doesn't matter.
We already gave them a gaggletack.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.386
I told you never to give out
free merchandise.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.847
But you said you had a bag of... them.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.391
Stand back. I think I know
how to deal with this.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.853
Mm?

12:49.937 --> 12:50.938
[sniffs]
Mmm.

12:51.021 --> 12:56.235
How about a bag of sweaty, tasty,
slightly moldy argyle socks?

12:56.902 --> 13:01.573
-Argyle?
-Argyle, Gut! That's argyle! Mm...

13:01.657 --> 13:02.783
Enrique!

13:04.159 --> 13:06.119
Oh... Enrique?

13:08.830 --> 13:09.706
Huh.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.378
-Enrique?
-[giggling]

13:16.880 --> 13:18.757
-[metal clattering]
-What's that sound?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.863
-[twig snaps]
-[gasps]

13:44.157 --> 13:46.410
I've brought the gaggletack.
Now, where is the child?

13:46.493 --> 13:49.872
-I sort of just lost him.
-Are you not babysitting?

13:49.955 --> 13:51.999
Well, I'm not saying I'm good at it.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.710
I don't understand
how the baby could elude you

13:54.793 --> 13:56.795
if you were rightfully sitting on him.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.756
Babysitting doesn't
literally mean you sit--

13:59.840 --> 14:03.260
Never mind. Just keep an eye out
while Toby and I handle this.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.308
What?
[grunting]

14:09.391 --> 14:13.061
Do you see this?
The little poop-bag locked us out!

14:13.145 --> 14:16.106
[sighs] He's been playing me all along,
hook, line, and sinker.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.775
Jim, he's a baby, not a poop-bag.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.028
Get a hold of yourself.
He can't even reach the lock.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.990
I'm telling you, Tobes, he's a changeling
and he knows about the bridge.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.951
We have to climb through Claire's window.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.038
Climb? Sure, why not pole vault
while we're at it?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.706
Get your head in the game, Jim!

14:33.457 --> 14:35.083
[Aaarrrgghh]
Pole vault.

14:35.709 --> 14:36.835
[yelps]

14:36.919 --> 14:38.504
-Thanks, wingman.
-[Aaarrrgghh grunts]

14:42.758 --> 14:45.093
Whoa!

14:45.177 --> 14:47.721
Dude... holy...

14:49.181 --> 14:50.724
Ow!

14:51.892 --> 14:54.102
Whoa...

14:54.186 --> 14:57.940
Hey, little guy, where are you?

14:58.690 --> 14:59.608
Ooh...

15:01.068 --> 15:02.319
Ah!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.696
I'm in a real girl's bedroom.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.491
Oh, Eli totally owes me five dollars.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.618
[gasps]
Hmm...

15:09.701 --> 15:10.536
What?

15:12.371 --> 15:14.581
[baby crying]

15:15.916 --> 15:18.210
[chuckling]

15:20.462 --> 15:23.131
This is what a girl's lips taste like!

15:28.971 --> 15:33.308
Aw, there, there.
Did the nasty Trollhunter-man scare you?

15:33.392 --> 15:37.729
Oh, come here, come here, little baby boy.
Don't worry. Don't cry. Shh.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.023
Come here. Yeah, yeah.
Come here, come here.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.484
Oh, hey, little guy!

15:43.193 --> 15:44.319
[deep grunt]

15:44.403 --> 15:45.279
[sobbing]

15:45.362 --> 15:47.197
Hey, what are you doing?
You're freaking him out.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.949
He is freaking me out!

15:49.032 --> 15:51.410
He made me stick my arm
in a diaper bin!

15:51.493 --> 15:53.662
[sniffs, retches]

15:53.745 --> 15:56.874
Oh, no. Made you, Jim? Really?
You're better than that.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.835
Who's a little baby boy?
You're a little baby boy.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.253
You're such a little baby.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.922
That's it. I've got to do this.
It won't hurt him.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.383
Hey! Stop! Slow--! Hey, can you not--?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.928
Dude, get away from him!
You're scaring Enrique!

Do you realize how good
you boys have it here?

17:25.963 --> 17:29.591
It's a party compared
to those troll-turds in the Darklands.

-I'm going in.
-No! We're not his safety line.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.696
This is a good test for our Trollhunter.
Jim must learn to stand on his own.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.447
Stay hidden.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.741
-I mean, lie low.
-Lie low.

17:55.617 --> 17:59.454
Where's the real Enrique,

You can't touch me. I'm her baby brother.
What do you suppose is gonna happen

18:16.555 --> 18:20.058
when they come home and see something's
happened to their precious?

[music continues]

19:08.232 --> 19:10.442
Are you... having a party?

19:10.526 --> 19:13.195
No! No, no party! Gotta go!

19:15.531 --> 19:18.408
-Enough's enough.
-Aaarrrgghh, what about our lesson?

19:18.492 --> 19:21.787
-Need help.
-But we are helping them by not helping.

19:22.538 --> 19:23.914
[scoffs]

19:23.997 --> 19:26.875
Can't you see? By coddling a pupil,
we're only stunting--

19:26.959 --> 19:30.420
[screams]
Aaarrrgghh, remove this door immediately!

19:30.504 --> 19:33.632
But be careful. Human houses
aren't built to withstand troll...

19:33.715 --> 19:34.758
[both gasp]

19:34.842 --> 19:36.093
-...strength.
-Oops.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.512
Stupid, smelly trolls!

19:38.595 --> 19:43.016
Their door! [groans]
What did you guys do to their door?

19:43.100 --> 19:47.020

We... Uh, we're here to... help.

19:47.104 --> 19:50.899
Well, I don't remember
inviting these two to dinner!

19:50.983 --> 19:54.820
First course, frozen peas!

19:54.903 --> 19:57.406
Don't make me climb up there, foul beast!

19:58.949 --> 20:00.075
Whoa!

20:02.327 --> 20:07.875
My eyes, my eyes! Green balls of madness!
They hurt very badly!

20:07.958 --> 20:08.876
[laughing]

20:10.669 --> 20:13.881
Aaarrrgghh, it's just like our video game.

-Sushi.
-Yeah!

-Draw fire?
-No, it's my turn.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.858
All right, enough! Where's the bridge?

20:32.941 --> 20:36.695
What bridge? London Bridge?
I hear it's falling down.

20:36.778 --> 20:40.908
Ow! Fleshbags... no sense of humor.

Can't blame a guy
for looking out for himself.

20:57.341 --> 21:01.845
But you can't tell anyone I told you.
I got a pretty sweet deal going here.

21:01.929 --> 21:06.433
If the bossman hears I squealed,
he'll feed me to Bular.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.770
-Bular's working with someone else?
-Who? Who is Bular working with?

21:09.853 --> 21:10.854

I suggest we make our egress.

21:16.151 --> 21:17.903
-Egress?
-It means to exit.

21:17.986 --> 21:22.574
-Whoa! I'm supposed to be babysitting it!
-And I need the proof for Vendel!

21:22.658 --> 21:25.452
And I need not to be split in two.
