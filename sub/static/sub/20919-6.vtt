00:08.500 --> 00:11.085
Hmm!

00:11.120 --> 00:13.170

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:23.165 --> 00:24.473
There's my ride.

00:34.551 --> 00:37.001
Sure beats curbside pickup.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.830
Indeed, Ms. Marvel.
Ooh! Thanks, Vision.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.848
What flavor? Strawberry, banana,

00:41.884 --> 00:44.284
and kale. Ugh!

00:44.319 --> 00:47.228
My spectrometer shows
it is very high in nutrients.

00:47.264 --> 00:50.048
It's good for you.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.785
Mmm! I am in full stress mode.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.378
Being an Avenger's
pressure enough,

00:54.413 --> 00:57.423
but now I've got a presentation
due, midterms to cram for...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.316
"Midterms"? Ah.

00:59.351 --> 01:03.528
I am not familiar with them,
but researching this concept,

01:03.563 --> 01:06.089
they appear to be a customary
element of your education system.

01:06.124 --> 01:10.510
Fascinating. [Sighs] I wish I could
assimilate stuff like you do.

01:10.546 --> 01:13.396
That'd be so cool. Hmm.
Maybe you could help.

01:13.431 --> 01:17.100
I mean, homework would go
a bajillion times faster.

01:17.136 --> 01:19.928
Like, what's the cosine
of a 30-degree angle?

01:19.963 --> 01:22.066
If I gave you that answer,
it would defeat the purpose

01:22.090 --> 01:24.533
of your analog
instruction method.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.119
Research indicates these lessons
are best learned the hard way.

01:27.154 --> 01:30.089
No shortcuts.

01:30.165 --> 01:33.099
[beeping] Intruder
detected at the mansion.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.918
Homework can wait.
It's Avenger time!

01:41.001 --> 01:44.586
Who do you think we're dealing with?
Hydra? Ultron? Thanos?

01:44.621 --> 01:47.013
Remember your lessons,
Ms. Marvel.

01:47.048 --> 01:49.168
Speculation could result
in underestimating one's foe.

01:51.127 --> 01:52.477
Intruder, halt!

01:57.876 --> 02:00.318
Taskmaster? Awesome!

02:00.354 --> 02:03.071
I mean, you are so busted!

02:17.162 --> 02:19.254
Hey, Taskmaster,
thanks for dropping by.

02:19.290 --> 02:21.289
Next time, try knocking first.

02:21.325 --> 02:24.426
Or is that the one move
you haven't copied?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.514
[grunting]

02:33.854 --> 02:36.479
[both grunt]

02:38.925 --> 02:42.327
[yells] [groans]

02:42.362 --> 02:46.840
[growls] Nice move.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.692
Patent's pending, so don't even
think about stealing that one.

02:49.727 --> 02:52.679
[groans]

02:52.714 --> 02:54.664
Mic drop!

02:54.699 --> 02:56.933
This isn't Mike.
This is the Taskmaster.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.003
No, "mic," as in "microphone"?

03:00.038 --> 03:01.590
It's like, you know, an expression you
say right after you've crushed it.

03:01.614 --> 03:05.883
My vocal hardware was not designed
to be extracted or crushed.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.961
[sighs] Never mind.

03:07.997 --> 03:10.689
You missed the housewarming.
So, what gives, Taskmaster?

03:10.724 --> 03:13.099
According to
the Avengers' files,

03:13.134 --> 03:15.394
you prefer well-calculated risks
with favorable odds.

03:15.429 --> 03:20.407
A solo assault on Avengers' home turf
is highly uncharacteristic behavior.

03:20.442 --> 03:23.259
Sometimes it pays
to be unpredictable.

03:23.294 --> 03:24.994
Besides, I'm not here
for a fight.

03:25.029 --> 03:26.988
I'm here to warn you.

03:30.519 --> 03:32.869
With Red Skull and the Leader
off the table,

03:32.904 --> 03:36.439
and the Avengers missing,
there's a power vacuum,

03:36.474 --> 03:40.184
so when MODOK offered
me a job, I took it.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.238
But MODOK's methods
are too extreme.

03:43.273 --> 03:45.699
He's planning to wipe
the entire planet clean

03:45.734 --> 03:48.368
and repopulate Earth
with his clones.

03:48.403 --> 03:50.145
Okay, I'm sufficiently
creeped out.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.871
Let's go stomp MODOK.

03:51.907 --> 03:54.499
Not so fast, Wasp.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.368
Taskmaster could handle
MODOK himself.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.320
Why ask us?

03:58.355 --> 04:00.172
World saving is Avengers' work.

04:00.207 --> 04:05.110
Sticking my neck out for others
would be bad for business.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.104
There's gotta be
something in it for you.

04:08.139 --> 04:12.100
That's when the whole "honor between
thieves" thing always breaks down.

04:12.135 --> 04:15.845
From what I've been told.
And from personal experience.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.950
When MODOK hired me, I thought
I'd get wealth and power.

04:19.985 --> 04:23.795
Ruling a planet filled with egotistical
bloated heads was not what I had in mind.

04:23.830 --> 04:29.284
[sighs] Yup, that's fair. What
do you think, Black Panther?

04:29.319 --> 04:32.612
The best assurance that you are not sending
us into a trap is to bring you with us.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.223
Aw, great.

04:35.258 --> 04:37.959
Nothing like being
saddled with a B-team.

04:37.994 --> 04:39.761
Hey, don't knock it
till you try it.

04:39.796 --> 04:41.604
Reboots are so in right now.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.634
This base is deep in the jungle.

04:46.669 --> 04:49.096
Hope everyone
packed their bug spray.

04:49.131 --> 04:52.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not cool,
Captain Marvel. Not cool.

04:52.109 --> 04:53.875
Sorry, Wasp. Meant no offense.

04:53.910 --> 04:54.993
None taken. All good.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.006
[beeping]

04:59.082 --> 05:01.633
How am I supposed to defend
myself with cuffs on?

05:01.668 --> 05:04.761
I am certain
you will find a way.

05:04.797 --> 05:07.797
But be warned, those restraints are
equipped with a location tracker.

05:10.652 --> 05:12.802
[groans]

05:16.400 --> 05:18.466
You need to factor
the sum of the cube.

05:18.502 --> 05:22.245
The answer should be 616.
Oh, right. Thanks.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.247
Ms. Marvel, the quickest route
isn't necessarily the best.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.951
[sighs] No shortcuts. I know.

05:27.986 --> 05:30.361
What's wrong with shortcuts?

05:30.397 --> 05:33.457
In a fight, every second counts.

05:33.459 --> 05:36.484
Working hard isn't always
the smartest solution.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.003
And my photographic reflexes
are the ultimate shortcut.

05:39.039 --> 05:44.084
Yes, but copying others' moves
could be considered cheating.

05:44.119 --> 05:48.889
Cheating? All I do is take
advantage of my resources.

05:48.965 --> 05:51.816
Look around. If everyone
pooled their knowledge,

05:51.852 --> 05:55.011
she'd be done
with her work by now.

05:55.046 --> 05:57.055
Hmm?

06:04.272 --> 06:06.231
[birds, animals chittering,
squawking]

06:09.319 --> 06:11.745
[Taskmaster]
Look. By the temple.

06:11.780 --> 06:15.248
Looks like they're on the move.

06:15.284 --> 06:18.693
You have said MODOK was
launching the attack from here.

06:18.728 --> 06:20.873
[Taskmaster] He was. There must
have been a change of plan.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.830
You should strike now
before he gets away.

06:22.865 --> 06:25.525
Not so fast.
I'm picking up several sensors

06:25.560 --> 06:27.660
installed around
the temple complex.

06:27.696 --> 06:30.588
Motion detectors.
Yes. We should use caution

06:30.623 --> 06:32.301
not to alert MODOK to our...
[alarm blaring]

06:32.325 --> 06:33.925
What?

06:35.679 --> 06:37.996
Taskmaster?

06:38.031 --> 06:41.115
Ohh! I'm surprised
even you would stoop so low

06:41.151 --> 06:43.568
as to join forces
with the Avengers.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.953
You didn't leave me
much choice, MODOK.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.116
Allow me to return the favor.

06:49.192 --> 06:53.828
Avengers, bear witness
to the wrath of my NODOKs:

06:53.863 --> 06:56.706
Network Operated Drones
Optimized for...

06:56.741 --> 06:59.117
Well, you'll find out.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.480
This calls for a gentle touch.

07:04.515 --> 07:06.833
Just kidding.
I'm gonna break 'em.

07:08.979 --> 07:09.979
[grunts]

07:11.864 --> 07:13.398
[grunts]

07:13.433 --> 07:15.633
[grunting]

07:18.288 --> 07:20.448
This is bigger than we anticipated!
There are too many!

07:22.108 --> 07:24.350
[laughing]

07:28.632 --> 07:30.565
[Ant-Man] Aw, man! These
guys just keep coming.

07:33.762 --> 07:35.042
Avengers, spread out! [Grunting]

07:37.699 --> 07:38.819
They are learning our moves.

07:40.385 --> 07:43.027
[Ms. Marvel grunts]

07:43.063 --> 07:45.121
These NODOKs are adapting
to your attacks

07:45.156 --> 07:47.540
because I designed
their battle program.

07:47.576 --> 07:49.117
Great. Now you tell us.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.668
Uh-oh.

07:51.904 --> 07:52.904
[thuds]

07:56.818 --> 07:59.552
Get these cuffs off me.
I know them.

07:59.587 --> 08:01.347
I'm the only one
who can counter their moves.

08:04.876 --> 08:08.328
Trusting Taskmaster is an irregular
course of action, Ms. Marvel.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.563
Are you sure about this? I know, I know.
He's a villain.

08:12.175 --> 08:14.793
I mean,
he has a skull for a face.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.237
[grunting]

08:19.733 --> 08:22.375
But look! He's kind of amazing.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.118
And he's gotten us this far.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.206
I found a shortcut.

08:35.690 --> 08:38.700
Where's MODOK going?
Avengers protocol dictates

08:38.735 --> 08:40.876
that we relay our position
and await backup.

08:40.912 --> 08:43.471
I will open a secure channel
to... There's no time.

08:43.506 --> 08:46.016
Taskmaster's right.
This is our only chance.

08:46.051 --> 08:48.260
Come on, Vision!

08:48.295 --> 08:49.615
[Vision]
This is highly irregular.

08:55.193 --> 08:57.518
Phasing through the door.
Nice shortcut.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.821
What? No. No, that was
not a... I never...

09:04.111 --> 09:06.227
This is precisely what I feared.

09:06.262 --> 09:07.962
Taskmaster has
led us into a trap.

09:07.997 --> 09:10.890
Easy. Don't blow a circuit.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.617
Is he always this uptight?

09:12.652 --> 09:14.360
Uh... [gasps] [thunderous thud]

09:14.396 --> 09:15.753
[rumbling]

09:15.788 --> 09:19.790
I'm detecting a rather large
energy signature below us.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.302
Relax, Vision. Maybe take
a chill... [rumbling]

09:22.337 --> 09:24.737
Whoa! On second thought, what
the heck's going on down there?

09:25.999 --> 09:29.458
[grunts, groans]

09:29.494 --> 09:30.518
[rumbling]

09:31.838 --> 09:32.854
[grunts]

09:40.505 --> 09:43.623
[Ant-Man] Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

09:43.659 --> 09:46.917
I believe we were premature in our
assessment of this headquarters.

09:46.953 --> 09:51.030
It appears we are inside some
sort of orbital launch vehicle.

09:51.066 --> 09:53.525
In English? You mean,
like a spaceship?

09:53.560 --> 09:58.212
Precisely. All incoming and
outgoing signals are jammed.

09:58.247 --> 10:00.757
I'm unable to establish
a comm-link with the Avengers.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.634
Leaving the atmosphere on a
school night is so not cool.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.054
No one on Earth
knows we're here.

10:06.089 --> 10:08.848
Following Taskmaster's shortcut
got us into this mess.

10:08.883 --> 10:11.934
Like I said, in a fight you've
gotta think fast, improvise.

10:11.970 --> 10:12.970
And it worked, didn't it?

10:14.589 --> 10:16.839
[beeps]

10:16.874 --> 10:18.194
[Ms. Marvel]
MODOK's got a moon base?

10:18.218 --> 10:21.702
If we hadn't stowed aboard,
MODOK would've gotten away.

10:21.738 --> 10:23.279
[chuckling]

10:33.266 --> 10:35.324
[grunts]

10:35.359 --> 10:37.502
[yells]

10:39.356 --> 10:41.322
Where's Ms. Marvel?

10:41.357 --> 10:44.859
I saw her last with Vision
and... Taskmaster.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.504
No signal from Ms. Marvel,
Vision, or Taskmaster.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.848
If they were on that ship,
they could be anywhere by now.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.179
[grunting] The moon!

10:56.214 --> 10:58.998
One small step for the Avengers,

10:59.034 --> 11:00.525
one embiggened step
for Ms. Marvel.

11:02.512 --> 11:04.696
[camera shutter clicking]
[gasps]

11:04.731 --> 11:07.173
Whoa.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.749
[chuckles]

11:08.784 --> 11:10.243
[camera shutter clicks]

11:13.498 --> 11:15.907
Wait up! I'm here. I'm here.
[beeps]

11:15.942 --> 11:18.100
[buzzes] [groans]

11:18.136 --> 11:20.002
Scans indicate
that the power conduits

11:20.038 --> 11:22.038
all terminate in one location.

11:22.073 --> 11:23.615
It must be MODOK's
command center.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.234
We can follow these ducts there,
disable the signal jammer,

11:27.270 --> 11:28.870
alert the Avengers...
[Taskmaster grunts]

11:31.274 --> 11:32.515
Or... that.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.055
You're strangling yourself
with these rules and protocols.

11:40.091 --> 11:44.752
Not everything has to be
so by the... book!

11:44.787 --> 11:48.489
We are cornered. Evasive
maneuver number 73, Ms. Marvel.

11:48.524 --> 11:50.967
No. Trust your instincts
and use what's around us.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.578
[grunting]

11:59.410 --> 12:00.910
Hmm?

12:00.945 --> 12:02.628
[grunts]

12:09.353 --> 12:11.087
Uh-oh. Hey!

12:11.122 --> 12:12.680
[grunts]

12:16.235 --> 12:18.361
[straining]

12:18.396 --> 12:19.553
Heads up! [Grunts]

12:19.588 --> 12:20.588
Whoa!

12:21.916 --> 12:23.733
[grunts]

12:24.936 --> 12:26.110
Nice!

12:30.183 --> 12:31.282
Now's our chance.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.495
[electronic trilling]

12:38.091 --> 12:40.942
I strongly advise against
such a hasty approach.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.955
Need I remind you what happened
the last two times you...

12:42.979 --> 12:46.613
[all yell, groan]

12:46.649 --> 12:49.258
[laughing]

12:53.298 --> 12:56.018
Well, great. So, now is when you get
to say, "I told you so," Vision.

12:57.418 --> 12:59.401
Vision?

12:59.437 --> 13:01.679
Are you okay?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.231
Vision?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.768
Oh, man!

13:07.804 --> 13:11.713
It appears your colleagues
can't handle their volts.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.383
[straining] I can't move.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.411
Yes. I've taken the precaution

13:17.447 --> 13:20.105
of inhibiting your pesky power.

13:20.141 --> 13:23.626
You won't be embiggening your way
out of this one, Ms. Marvel.

13:24.979 --> 13:26.871
[grunts]

13:26.906 --> 13:29.599
What exactly
are you up to, MODOK?

13:29.634 --> 13:32.251
Oh, just ushering in a new era.

13:32.286 --> 13:36.489
The era of MODOK!

13:36.524 --> 13:40.926
In mere moments, I will launch
satellites armed with atomizing lasers

13:40.962 --> 13:44.888
that will render Earth's oxygen
into a poison.

13:44.924 --> 13:48.568
The world as you know it
will cease to exist.

13:48.603 --> 13:52.906
And once the Earth is clear, my
brood will repopulate the planet...

13:52.941 --> 13:53.898
[muffled gag]

13:53.933 --> 13:56.200
And I, MODOK,

13:56.236 --> 13:59.461
will reign
as their supreme leader!

13:59.497 --> 14:02.715
No, you won't! You and your creepy
little MO-DOK-lings are gonna wish

14:02.751 --> 14:05.150
you never messed with the
All-New, All-Different Avengers!

14:05.186 --> 14:06.811
Am I right, guys?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.047
Uh, guys?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.856
Uh... Avenger.

14:10.892 --> 14:15.319
[laughs]
Big talk for such a puny head.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.648
But I'm afraid
it's already too late.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.709
Stand by to deploy satellites!
[beeps]

14:21.744 --> 14:25.980
[female automated voice]
Five, four, three, two, one.

14:33.798 --> 14:38.217
[MODOK] Enjoy your front-row seat
to the annihilation of mankind!

14:38.252 --> 14:40.036
[laughing]

14:48.296 --> 14:49.587
Not... good.

15:12.903 --> 15:17.248
[grunting] Huh? Vision!

15:17.325 --> 15:20.108
Once your body's exposed
to the vacuum of space,

15:20.144 --> 15:22.269
we have approximately
one minute before...

15:22.304 --> 15:25.473
Wait. What? [Inhales deeply]

15:25.508 --> 15:28.501
Your lungs are likely to burst if
you hold your breath. [Exhales]

15:28.536 --> 15:30.711
I will be back.

15:45.803 --> 15:48.246
[all yelling]

15:48.281 --> 15:49.355
[groaning]

15:51.392 --> 15:54.644
[grunts, coughs]

15:54.679 --> 15:56.470
[bones crack] [grunts]

15:56.505 --> 15:57.791
That's one way
to make an entrance.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.781
[grunts] I improvised.

15:59.817 --> 16:02.493
You again? [Growling]

16:04.989 --> 16:07.865
I just want you to stop living.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.177
Is that too much to ask?
[grunts]

16:11.212 --> 16:12.870
Draw MODOK away. I need to get

16:12.906 --> 16:15.106
to that command terminal
and shut down those satellites.

16:17.301 --> 16:19.385
You know, I'm starting
to like this guy.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.282
[grunts]

16:30.815 --> 16:35.034
[female automated voice] Planetary
annihilation initialized.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.960
The trajectories are locked in.

16:36.996 --> 16:41.340
[laughing]
This struggle is fruitless.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.851
You've already lost!

16:43.886 --> 16:46.328
Victory is never assured, MODOK.
Eh?

16:46.363 --> 16:50.066
I have one trick left up
my proverbial sleeve. Huh?

16:50.101 --> 16:52.087
I left one of the Taskmaster's
cuffs on the satellite.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.711
It contains a location tracker.
[beeping]

16:59.094 --> 17:00.217
Scratch one!

17:04.406 --> 17:06.714
Not today, MODOK!

17:06.750 --> 17:08.768
[grunts]

17:12.857 --> 17:13.857
Scratch two!

17:17.903 --> 17:19.603
Boom! Three for three!

17:19.637 --> 17:22.556
Noooo!

17:22.590 --> 17:24.208
Ooh, he looks mad. [Crying]

17:24.242 --> 17:26.344
Right, Taskmaster? Huh?

17:26.378 --> 17:29.080
[growling]

17:32.502 --> 17:34.985
[MODOK] Watch as I merge
with my moon base.

17:35.020 --> 17:39.632
No longer MODOK, I am MOON-DOK!

17:39.667 --> 17:41.542
[wind howling]

17:41.577 --> 17:44.053
Whoa!

17:45.831 --> 17:47.223
[grunting] Aah!

17:50.586 --> 17:51.894
Hold on!

17:56.834 --> 17:58.109
[alarm blaring] [trilling]

18:04.592 --> 18:07.235
Looks like MODOK's got a big
head in more ways than one.

18:07.270 --> 18:08.886
We can use that
against him, right?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.371
Attack plan Epsilon.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.792
Read my mind.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.462
[grunting]

18:27.498 --> 18:30.374
You think we're scared
of mindless robots?

18:30.410 --> 18:34.561
Huh! If you could control all of
them, now, that'd be impressive.

18:34.597 --> 18:36.813
[MOON-DOK] Of course I can!

18:36.849 --> 18:39.525
I was going easy on you.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.472
[grunting]

18:53.508 --> 18:58.085
Are you just gonna give up
on world domination?

18:58.120 --> 19:01.405
What, can't the mighty MOON-DOK
build more satellites?

19:01.440 --> 19:04.700
I was just getting to that!

19:04.736 --> 19:06.010
Follow the leader.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.474
[female automated voice] Warning.
Power levels at maximum.

19:12.509 --> 19:14.785
[MOON-DOK]
Now look what you made me do!

19:14.820 --> 19:18.105
[female automated voice] System failure.
Failure. [Crying out]

19:18.141 --> 19:19.648
Failure. [Groaning]

19:21.885 --> 19:24.529
B.R.B.!

19:24.564 --> 19:27.514
[pants] Oh!

19:27.549 --> 19:29.942
Ghosting like that
is so not cool.

19:29.977 --> 19:32.820
I'm not one
to overstay my welcome.

19:32.855 --> 19:35.564
Come on. You were awesome today.

19:35.599 --> 19:37.060
It was like having the
old-school Avengers with us...

19:37.084 --> 19:39.360
Cap, Hawkeye, Widow...

19:39.395 --> 19:40.789
Please, never tell them
I said that.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.455
Move. Now.

19:43.491 --> 19:46.675
You should stay. Admit it.
We make a pretty great team.

19:46.711 --> 19:49.161
I'll admit, I like your style.

19:49.196 --> 19:51.430
But if you don't
get out of my way,

19:51.465 --> 19:53.641
I won't hesitate to do
what I need to do.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.386
[chuckling]

19:57.421 --> 19:59.688
Naive little girl.

19:59.724 --> 20:03.117
Don't you get it? I'm a bad guy.

20:03.152 --> 20:05.319
Actually, I do get it.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.581
Avengers protocol number 1138:

20:09.616 --> 20:11.625
Never trust Taskmaster.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.936
And always stall for backup.

20:13.971 --> 20:15.829
[grumbles]
[weapon clatters on ground]

20:15.864 --> 20:19.199
Look, T.M., I really did
appreciate all the hot tips.

20:19.235 --> 20:21.819
But seriously, you think
an Avengers fangirl like me

20:21.854 --> 20:23.695
would fall for all
that "shortcut" business?

20:23.730 --> 20:25.539
From a guy in a skull mask?

20:25.574 --> 20:27.891
Now who's naive?

20:27.926 --> 20:29.218
[camera shutter clicks]

20:37.178 --> 20:39.303
Huh?

20:39.338 --> 20:42.256
That was my parting gift,

20:42.291 --> 20:45.759
before you betrayed
and captured me.

20:45.794 --> 20:49.405
Aw, thanks, but no, thanks.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.741
I'll do the work myself. Then
I have to do my presentation.

20:52.776 --> 20:57.204
Although, this whole adventure
did give me an idea.

20:57.239 --> 21:00.841
Putting a man on the moon took lots
of hard work. But most importantly,

21:00.877 --> 21:04.044
winning the space race meant
quick thinking, not shortcuts.

21:04.079 --> 21:07.547
Believe it or not, there's a big
difference between the two.

21:07.583 --> 21:11.593
And that kind of quick thinking is what the
Avengers still use to protect our planet today.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.768
Did you drop the mic? [Groans] I really
shouldn't have taught you that one.

21:19.803 --> 21:23.105
Yeah. I got an A.
Should've been an A-plus,

21:23.141 --> 21:25.902
but the teacher deducted points because my
reports always end up being about the Avengers.

21:25.926 --> 21:27.826
So, crushed it?

21:27.862 --> 21:35.862
Crushed it.

21:36.305 --> 21:42.760
