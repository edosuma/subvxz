Tommy?

01:14.658 --> 01:16.868
Tommy, the baby.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.579
It's your turn.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.291
Please.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.502
Right. Right. Okay, okay.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.469
God damned baby.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.903
Don't do that.

01:51.987 --> 01:56.115
The second we walked in here, I
could feel my wallet start whining.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.993
If we're gonna get the steak,
you wanna get the Oregon Pinot.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.163
Yeah, I saw that.
It's 200 bucks though.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.207
Babe, it's our anniversary.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.002
Have you had a chance to decide
on some wine this evening?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.669
You have no live entertainment.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.798
You are correct, sir.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.967
And I have no money. An
idea, and you can say no.

02:15.052 --> 02:19.514
Is it possible for me to dance
off a portion of our tab?

02:19.598 --> 02:21.933
Dance it away?

02:22.017 --> 02:24.227
It would be unusual.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.436
Look how cute he is.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.896
Has this worked before?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.523
Not that I can remember.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.233
Are you sure? Because
he's very good.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.526
Really?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.986
No.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.363
You're an idiot.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.240
I'm an idiot? You married me.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.452
So?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.120
Three years!

02:43.205 --> 02:44.497
I know. Three years.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.415
Well?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.794
I knew you were
gonna bring this up.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.212
So, you remembered?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.589
Absolutely, I remember.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.966
So, you're ready?

02:55.050 --> 02:57.009
Yeah, I'm totally ready.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.928
You're ready to be a dad?

02:59.012 --> 03:02.557
A dad? What? I thought we
were talking about anal.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.601
Is the three year
not the anal anniversary?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.688
No. It is. Okay.

03:08.772 --> 03:12.650
Okay, if you really want to,
I'm willing to give it a try.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.735
Seriously?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.321
Yes. We need to stop by the
sex shop on the way home.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.950
I need to get a strap-on. Do
you prefer regular or ribbed?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.661
You are good. You had me there.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.329
Seriously, I'll give it a try.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.415
I just don't know
if it will fit.

03:27.499 --> 03:32.628
Of course it won't fit.
That's the fun. Pain.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.591
We could do that, or we
could just have a baby.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.927
You did remember.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.345
I did.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.180
You really wanna have a baby?

03:43.265 --> 03:44.765
Yeah, I really do.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.100
We're gonna have a family.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.685
We are gonna have a family.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.437
You can teach him
how to play baseball.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.771
And how to pick up chicks.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.023
What if it's a girl?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.524
I love girl on girl.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.485
Get it out. Just get it all out.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.156
So Audrey, when do you
wanna get started?

04:08.457 --> 04:14.837
♪ I feel like something
Good is on the way ♪

04:15.964 --> 04:17.589
Hey, how's my form?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.819
What? What's wrong?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.696
What?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.865
Nothing. Nothing

04:42.950 --> 04:45.701
Are you bored?

04:45.786 --> 04:49.080
Are you tired of having sex with me?
Are you disgusted?

04:49.164 --> 04:52.166
Can you get out of me, please?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.751
Ouch.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.212
Why isn't this working, Tommy?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.923
Something's wrong.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.676
Maybe it's 'cause you don't
really wanna have a baby.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.053
How can you say that?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.223
I've been working my ass off for nine
months trying to get you pregnant.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.018
So it's a job? I'm sorry, how
much, how much do I owe you?

05:11.103 --> 05:13.020
Is it 40, 50 bucks?

05:13.105 --> 05:16.774
50 bucks? That's it?

05:16.858 --> 05:19.860
You know, you could possibly get
a back alley shave for that,

05:19.945 --> 05:21.946
but not this, sister.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.698
I'm sorry I low balled you.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.866
Well, you did. That was
a serious low ball.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.952
I'm not a crack whore.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.621
You're the one who said having
sex with me was like a job.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.248
I never said that.
You said that.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.749
You weren't thinking it?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.334
No.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.253
It felt like it.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.131
It's not what I was thinking,
because I'll tell you,

05:40.215 --> 05:43.884
sex with you is... it's
beautiful, you know.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.845
And it's wonderful.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.930
And it's amazing.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.184
Sex with you is like...
it's like, it's like...

05:52.269 --> 05:54.687
It's like a full time job.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.814
Maybe you oughta get tested.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.486
Tested? No. I'm good.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.822
Oh, you're good? How do
you know you're good?

06:04.906 --> 06:08.576
Excuse me, Wade. I'm shooting good stuff.
I know this for a fact.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.665
All right. I never
told anyone this,

06:14.750 --> 06:18.002
and I swear to God I'll kill
everyone if you say anything,

06:18.086 --> 06:22.381
but when I decided to ask Audrey to marry
me, I couldn't afford a decent ring, right?

06:22.466 --> 06:24.967
So I told her that I
joined a softball team.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.969
You suck at softball.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.805
I hate softball. I told her
I joined the softball team.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.976
What I did instead, I drove back to
Pasadena to a sperm bank. Right?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.772
I donated sperm. Every
week for 20 weeks.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.857
Eighty-five bucks
a pop they paid me.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.443
At the sperm bank, they
don't take bad sperm.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.695
They test the shit out of it.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.989
Hey, dude, 85 bucks a pop?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.033
If someone were
to rob that place

06:49.117 --> 06:51.952
and sell the sperm on the street,
they can make a fortune.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.663
Jesus, Zig Zag. Have you
been downtown lately?

06:54.748 --> 06:58.000
There's enough sperm on the
street to choke Doogie Howser.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.127
Hey, bring out
the pictures, man.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.463
You brought the pictures
of the ex, right?

07:02.547 --> 07:05.716
The pictures of Tanya? Bring 'em out.
I've seen that shit.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.593
She's my girlfriend now.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.845
She's aware you're
showing these pictures?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.639
Yeah, probably.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.350
Holy shit, dude.
Look at those nipples.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.395
No offense, but I can tell how Tommy
might be able to pull this girl.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.022
But with Wade?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.857
Did you say "no offense"?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.984
Is she a chubby chaser?

07:24.069 --> 07:25.986
That's more offense.
You keep offending.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.322
I'm sorry, but okay, no offense.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.825
Just tell us how
you got this chick.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.495
You see, Tommy and I are cut
from the same cloth, my friend.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.165
Good cock, bad cock. Come on.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.672
Honey, is he even
ejaculating properly?

07:44.756 --> 07:48.384
Because I read on the Internet that
guys are faking it. It's like a trend.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.885
Mine does not fake it.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.554
Nobody likes a gloater.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.014
How do guys fake it?

07:54.099 --> 07:57.143
They keep a bike bottle in the bed and
then they squirt it over your back.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.061
I saw it on YouTube.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.522
Tommy is not faking it,
but something's wrong.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.107
I'm kinda worried.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.234
Are you using your
fertility calendar?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.861
Yeah, I have an app for that.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.821
I love apps.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.990
You know, 90% of the time,
it's the guy's fault.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.118
It's definitely Tommy. You
need to get that junk checked.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.871
Hey, listen, guys, can
we keep this between us?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.790
Tommy's a little sensitive
about all this stuff.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.208
I won't say anything.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.501
Who am I gonna tell?

08:24.379 --> 08:26.297
Hey, Coach Stubbs.
How're you doing?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.215
Tommy Macklin.
How the hell are you?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.675
Not too bad.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427
How's that pretty
wife of yours?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.345
Good, good. How's
the team this year?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.807
Honestly? We suck about nine
different kinds of ass.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.601
We're pulling
for you either way.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.020
Thanks. We're pulling
for you, too.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.691
For who? For me?

08:45.775 --> 08:49.320
Well, I understand you have a
little trouble knocking up the Mrs.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.780
You know what works really well?
Hot peppers.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.949
Eat as many of 'em as you can.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.203
Just make sure you don't go
munching on her biscuit right away.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.954
You'll kill the poor woman.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.666
You gotta keep
the sperm cool, yah?

09:02.751 --> 09:05.169
You can't let the balls
get overheated.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.338
That's why they hang
on the outside.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.548
Like an air cooled
Volkswagen engine.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.259
Shitake mushroom,
ginger root, cucumber.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.596
You mash it all up. You allow it
to boil for three long hours,

09:15.680 --> 09:17.973
and you gently lower your
ball sack down in there,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.683
and let them steep
for ten minutes.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.727
Blue Mountain, Jamaican
remedy that.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.688
What the hell are you
doing to me, Audrey?

09:24.773 --> 09:26.690
Did you go and tell
the whole world?

09:26.775 --> 09:29.526
No, I told three people. I
told Mona, Greta, and Karen.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.112
You didn't tell three people.
You told three women.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.407
What's that supposed to mean?
Where's the ginger root?

09:35.492 --> 09:38.160
Why do you think there are
no female serial killers?

09:38.245 --> 09:43.040
Because after they kill the first
guy, they gotta go tell somebody.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.000
That's actually a good point.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.549
Hello?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.426
Oh, hi there.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.845
Yeah.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.932
Well, I hadn't heard that.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.142
No. No, thank you.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.186
Yeah.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.231
I love you, too. Okay.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.440
Who was that?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.776
That was your mom.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.904
She said I should try putting Ben Gay
on my scrotum to heat up the sperm.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.115
She just... Do you think
that would work?

10:16.199 --> 10:17.866
No.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.577
Why does everybody
have advice for me?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.080
Maybe, maybe it's you.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.293
Where are all the calls of everybody
telling you to pour hot sauce

10:27.377 --> 10:30.004
on your... vagina?

10:30.088 --> 10:33.924
Okay. I made us appointments with
Dr. Vickerey to get us both checked out.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.885
He's supposed to be the best, so
you gotta get your sperm checked.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.221
Honey, there's nothing
wrong with my sperm.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.015
Really? How do you know that?

10:41.099 --> 10:42.891
'Cause there's
a party down there!

10:42.976 --> 10:45.352
Do you hear that?

10:45.437 --> 10:48.147
Seriously, this thing
smells like shit.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.024
Can you lower 'em in?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.278
I think you just
do one at a time.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.821
How am I gonna do
one at a time?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.489
I don't have them.
I don't know.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.369
I'm telling you,
it is a waste of time.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.121
Just do it. Prove her wrong.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.081
Show her you got
awesome sperms.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.584
Dude, Audrey's making
you check your sperm?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.419
Tell her I said to lighten up.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.548
No, I just have
trouble in groups.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.009
It's hard to keep it going when there's
a bunch of other people around.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.719
You've never been to an orgy?

11:18.803 --> 11:21.055
No. Have you?

11:21.139 --> 11:25.726
Nah. But I had sex with two different
chicks in the same week. Bifecta!

11:25.810 --> 11:27.895
I went to an orgy once.

11:27.979 --> 11:31.273
Not with Audrey.

11:31.358 --> 11:35.903
There's just gonna be a bunch of other
guys jerking off in all the other rooms.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.738
I don't feel like it.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.656
But didn't you do
that for a living?

11:39.741 --> 11:41.909
No, not for a living.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.827
But you got paid to do it.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.121
Okay, fine, but I knew the
guy who owned the place,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.248
and he let me come in after
hours when it was empty.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.501
Dude, get this.
My brother's a lawyer.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.462
He represented this pervert that
works at one of those clinics.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.173
Sick bastard hid cameras
in the smoke detectors.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.967
Cops raided his house.
Found stacks of DVD's

11:59.052 --> 12:01.887
of guys choking their cobras.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.848
What?

12:04.933 --> 12:06.934
Wade, let's go.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.602
Cool. Let's get out.

12:08.686 --> 12:12.314
I'll catch you guys
in a few. I'll follow.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.233
Why do we hang out
with that douche bag?

12:14.317 --> 12:16.693
Doesn't bother you he used
to go out with Audrey?

12:16.778 --> 12:19.822
I used to go out with Tanya and
you still hang out with me.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.699
Yeah, but at least you don't
look like a blond squirrel.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.243
I do not.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.580
You know what?

12:28.665 --> 12:31.458
Don't worry about this jerking off thing.
You're gonna be fine.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.544
I have a little
inspiration for you.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.507
For old time's sake.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.927
Oh, no, no. I can't.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.971
Yes, you can.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.848
That's not right.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.892
But those nipples
are world fucking class.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.354
They are. They're like little
tits on top of big tits.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.523
No, take them. I can't.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.110
Okay. Sure? You're too good.
You're too good.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.697
And by that I mean you're
an unbelievable pussy.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.949
Maybe so. Maybe so.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.328
Well.

13:08.413 --> 13:12.082
Excuse me. I go whack my
ding-dong into a plastic dish

13:12.167 --> 13:14.501
with a bunch of
dudes all around.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.628
Okay. Don't do it
while you're driving.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.755
♪ I just need ♪

13:18.840 --> 13:23.427
♪ Your love injection ♪

13:23.511 --> 13:29.766
♪ I don't need
Your affection ♪ ♪

13:29.851 --> 13:32.144
Dr. Vickerey is the
best in the business.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.938
If he can't impregnate
your wife, no one can.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.565
You'll be in room four today.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.442
Pedro!

13:38.526 --> 13:41.862
Sorry. I-I am sorry. I was...

13:41.946 --> 13:45.032
just making a phone call.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.242
I'm sorry, Mr. Macklin.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.869
I wasn't jerking off.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.374
As you can see, we have several
different forms of stimulation,

13:54.459 --> 13:56.251
both homo and hetero.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.544
I'll take hetero.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.549
Well, you have 20 minutes.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.593
Relax and take your time.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.679
Hey, doctor,
where is the lubrication?

14:07.764 --> 14:11.141
Oh, no, we can't run a risk of contamination.
You will just have to dry.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.268
And you can't use
saliva either.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.687
The human mouth
is quite filthy.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.314
Okay.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.483
I'll just be right
here if you need me.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.984
Okay.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.947
Right where? Like right there?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.116
Oh, well, I can go away for a
few minutes if you prefer.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.410
No, it's, it's...

14:46.886 --> 14:49.471
Damn, it's hot.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.224
Yeah. Let's take a break.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.252
Gal, as pretty as you are,
we're still missing one thing.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.129
Oh, yeah? What's that?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.840
You gotta meet
my friend, Big Jim.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.509
I sure hope he's handsome.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.807
Nice to meet you, Jim.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.434
You are big.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.823
Mr. Macklin, could you
please turn that down a bit?

15:49.907 --> 15:52.951
It's a touch loud.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.955
I have to go home.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.793
Babe, all you had to do
was jerk off into a cup.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.879
What's the big deal?
I mean, seriously.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.965
How many times have you masturbated
in your life? A hundred?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.884
Sure. About 100, yeah.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.969
I called and they said
you can do it at home.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.764
You have to get the sample
there within 30 minutes.

16:13.848 --> 16:17.434
I've timed the drive and it's 1
8 minutes, so don't waste time.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.770
I'm teaching a class at 4:00,

16:19.854 --> 16:23.231
so you have the whole place to yourself
to do your little jerky business.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.778
Sort of takes the fun out of it
when you tell me I have to do it.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.280
I prefer sneaking around
when you're not here

16:30.365 --> 16:31.990
and pretending I don't do it.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.241
Yeah, okay.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.301
Hi. What's your name?

16:51.386 --> 16:53.011
Alberto.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.180
Could you help me
with my lotion?

16:55.264 --> 16:58.892
By boyfriend usually does
it but we just broke up.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.944
Thanks.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.905
Si, senora. No hay problema.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.330
Oh, could you do
the bottoms, too?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.761
Shit, shit.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.307
Hi, there. How are you
on this blessed day?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.184
Hi. Good.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.562
Great. If you have a moment,
we'd like to tell you

17:43.646 --> 17:45.939
about our personal
savior, Jesus Christ.

17:46.023 --> 17:50.610
You know, I don't know if right now
is the best time to talk about Jesus.

17:50.695 --> 17:54.114
It's not a good time
to talk about Jesus?

17:54.198 --> 17:58.160
God's only son died for his sins
but it's "not a good time."

17:58.244 --> 18:01.496
Well, I guess some people just think
they're more important than Jesus.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.082
I don't think I'm more
important than Jesus.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.626
But unless he can miracle a
baby up into my wife's vagina,

18:06.711 --> 18:08.378
then I gotta take a pass.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.256
Thank you though so much.
Okay, bye.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.764
All right.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.830
Jesus Christ. Come on.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.877
Tommy? You're home?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.087
Hi.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.923
What's going on?

18:53.007 --> 18:55.634
Oh, you kinda caught me
doing something naughty.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.177
Really?

18:57.261 --> 18:59.095
My college roommate,
Jenny, is here.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.223
And we've been talking
about old times,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.975
and laughing about how we
used to share everything.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.644
Say hi, Jenny.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.730
Hi.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.857
Anyway, since
we share everything,

19:10.942 --> 19:14.236
Jenny was wondering
if we could share you.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.571
Oh, okay.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.198
He said yes.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.541
Go ahead, Tommy.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.917
Really?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.336
Thanks, Audrey.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.592
He likes it from behind.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.636
Oh, cool.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.518
Thank you.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.068
Oh, Jesus!

19:55.152 --> 19:57.237
Do you have enough
time for me now, Tommy?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.905
Why?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.097
Dude.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.067
No, sir. No way.

21:13.356 --> 21:17.233
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

21:42.510 --> 21:45.053
Nice move, dickhead.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.351
Hey!

22:33.853 --> 22:37.731
What's up, Tommy?

22:37.815 --> 22:40.775
The pictures, the ones of Tanya, I
left them on the bathroom sink.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.318
You gotta go get 'em.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.195
Yeah, dog. I knew you'd use 'em.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.989
I used pictures of cantaloupes.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.282
Did you say cantaloupes?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.617
I got some flat tires.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.203
Some flat tires? Are you high?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.622
You've gotta go to my house
and get those pictures.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.957
Of the cantaloupes?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.459
The pictures of Tanya!

22:57.543 --> 22:59.586
You said you didn't use them.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.047
The back door's open. The
pictures are in the bathroom.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.923
Okay, I got one more set to do.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.842
Do this now!

23:05.926 --> 23:07.594
All right. Chill out.
I'm on the move.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.971
You chill out.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.473
You fuck chill out!

23:17.021 --> 23:19.147
Audrey. Audrey!

23:20.149 --> 23:21.900
Hey.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.611
My God, are you taking
gorgeous pills or what?

23:24.695 --> 23:26.654
Thanks, Todd.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.823
Hi.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.326
Oh, my gosh, she's so cute.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.787
She could've been yours
if you'd said yes to me.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.413
Just kidding.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.791
We're actually trying
for one of our own.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.918
Right. Yeah.
I heard about that.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.669
Tom's having some trouble?

23:41.754 --> 23:44.172
Oh... no, no.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.300
Audrey, it's okay. It's me.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.429
Okay, well, yeah. But
it's gonna be fine

23:51.514 --> 23:53.515
'cause we're seeing this
really great doctor,

23:53.599 --> 23:55.266
and it's all gonna be
taken care of.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.310
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.188
Look, you never know how these
things are gonna work out.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.110
Hey, slow down, asshole!
I got kids!

24:06.529 --> 24:08.029
Well, I'd better get her back.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.073
I'll see you at
Tommy's birthday.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.783
Good to see you.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.785
I miss you.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.913
Okay. Bye.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.986
Fucking wild
goose chase, Tommy.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.657
Hello.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.202
Goddammit.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.875
Tommy?

25:01.959 --> 25:05.253
Oh, shit. shit, shit, shit.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.172
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.987
♪ I'm a man ♪

25:31.071 --> 25:33.865

25:40.706 --> 25:42.624
Wade, did you get the pictures?

25:42.708 --> 25:43.833
I couldn't find them.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.335
Where's my wife?

25:45.419 --> 25:47.003
In the shower.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.379
What's with the pants?

25:48.464 --> 25:51.424
I saw those cantaloupes.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.427
Hey! Help!

26:00.100 --> 26:01.976
Hey. How did it go?

26:02.061 --> 26:04.771
Great. I had a few
flat tires, but...

26:04.855 --> 26:05.980
A few flat tires?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.398
Yeah.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.900
Did you get it there on time?

26:08.984 --> 26:10.777
Of course I got it
there on time.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.654
Thank you for doing
that for me.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.990
I'm happy to. I'm just
glad that tomorrow

26:16.075 --> 26:18.326
we have proof that my
guys are good to go.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.328
Me, too.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.164
Can I put my penis in
your vagina right now?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.415
Yes.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.085
I'm feeling really potent.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.420
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.757
I'm afraid your sperm count
is too low to conceive.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.344
But that is impossible.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
I know some men find it
difficult to hear that but...

26:39.056 --> 26:41.683
Hold on. How can we
tell that it's not...

26:41.767 --> 26:43.768
I've already examined Audrey.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.563
Her tubes are clear. Her
hormone levels are perfect.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.941
And she has, in my opinion,

26:50.025 --> 26:53.695
two of the pinkest, plumpest, and most
beautiful ovaries I have ever seen.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.530
Thank you.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.784
Are you hitting on my wife?

26:59.868 --> 27:02.537
Is that what he was doing?
It seemed like it was.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.247
Sorry about him.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.292
Okay, so what exactly
is wrong with my sperm?

27:09.878 --> 27:12.171
This is a slide
of a normal sample.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.133
And this is your sample.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.551
They look drunk.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.386
They do, don't they?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.763
Where are they going?

27:20.848 --> 27:23.474
O-okay, so just
for argument sake,

27:23.559 --> 27:26.352
let's just say you're right.
How did they get that way?

27:26.437 --> 27:28.521
One possible cause
is testicular trauma.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.982
Have you ever experienced
anything like that?

27:38.991 --> 27:42.618
No, no. Not that I can recall.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.748
Oh, well then, I'm going to order
you a scrotal exploration.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.667
A scrotal what now?
What is that? What?

27:49.752 --> 27:53.129
Sometimes a tear will form
in the tunica albuginea

27:53.213 --> 27:56.632
resulting in extrusion
of the testicular contents.

27:56.717 --> 28:01.429
We simply insert a small camera into
the penis, through the urethra...

28:01.513 --> 28:05.058
This sounds amazing. How about this,
and I'm just spitballing here,

28:05.142 --> 28:07.518
why don't we take my ball
sack and scrape it up

28:07.603 --> 28:10.605
against a cheese grater? Or
maybe go out to your car

28:10.689 --> 28:12.607
and slam my dick in the trunk.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.026
Do you feel like
that might help or?

28:15.110 --> 28:17.278
I'm sorry.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.032
I can assure you, Mr. Macklin, this
is a mostly painless procedure.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.951
Yeah, I'm kinda getting caught
up on the word "mostly."

28:24.036 --> 28:26.704
It's just... It's a
lot to take in.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.874
Okay, okay. So, let's say

28:29.958 --> 28:32.210
nothing comes in this
scrotal exploration.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.754
Then my suggestion would
be that you find a donor.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.217
But we're not there, yet, so.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.469
I think you're right.
We're not there, yet.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.638
We're not even close
to being there, yet.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.307
I think you've freaked
out my wife, sir.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.935
And we're gonna be... we're
gonna be leaving now.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.812
Are you okay, honey?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.939
Too far. Okay.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.441
Oh, sorry.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.700
What's up with Audrey and Tommy? Why
aren't they talking to each other?

29:04.785 --> 29:08.579
It's this whole baby thing. I think
it's time one of us stepped up.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.707
I think one of us should offer
our sperm to our buddy.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.793
That's the right thing to do.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.672
All right. As his best friend,
I will toss it in there.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.967
No, seriously, no offense.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.845
Hey, hey, this isn't
genetic, okay?

29:23.929 --> 29:27.098
It's called laziness.
My sperm is thin, fit.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.101
Whatever. We don't know whose
sperm he's gonna choose.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.019
What?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.772
What, 'cause I'm black?

29:34.857 --> 29:38.484
'Cause we wouldn't want Tommy
to have a biracial baby, right?

29:38.569 --> 29:41.821
The kid might grow up to be the president.
Or Halle Berry.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.365
Okay, fine. We settle
it this way, okay?

29:44.450 --> 29:46.701
We all jack off
into a cup, right?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.787
And we swirl it around, and
then may the best man win.

29:49.872 --> 29:52.874
May the best man win what?

29:52.958 --> 29:56.627
Just... The World Series?

29:58.380 --> 30:00.756
Happy birthday, man.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.925
Awesome party, Tom.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.303
What if I get drunk and
take all my clothes off?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.097
It might be so-mething nice.

30:08.182 --> 30:11.184
That is good, right? All right.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.771
Bye.

30:15.856 --> 30:19.108
Hey, can I get you a drink?
You have a drink.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.860
Do you need anything? Food or?

30:20.944 --> 30:23.279
Hey, guys.
Happy birthday, Tommy.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.530
Hey, Julie.

30:24.615 --> 30:25.781
Happy birthday, dude.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.159
Thanks.

30:28.243 --> 30:32.705
Todd and I have been talking and
we heard about your problem.

30:32.789 --> 30:37.502
And we would like
to offer our services.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.253
For what?

30:39.338 --> 30:44.175
What we'd like to do
is offer you our sperm.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.011
What?

30:47.095 --> 30:51.015
Tommy, we've been blessed with three
smart, beautiful, healthy children.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.268
Honestly, when Todd first brought
it up, I was unsure, too.

30:54.353 --> 30:58.606
When Audrey said no to Todd's
proposal all those years ago,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.107
Seems like yesterday.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.193
She gave me a gift.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.737
And this is my chance
to repay her.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.448
So, what do you say?

31:10.369 --> 31:13.079
What do I say?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.209
Honey, let me.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.966
Dude, I am sorry.
Huge misunderstanding.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.425
We did not mean to offend.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.177
We were just trying to be nice.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.721
I just thought if you're
gonna have a donor,

31:30.806 --> 31:33.099
might as well be someone you know.
That's all.

31:33.183 --> 31:36.686
Right? That's it! There's
no reason to be rude.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.647
I'm not asking to stick
it in Audrey directly.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.775
I mean, unless you're into that.
Some guys are.

31:42.859 --> 31:46.404
I don't know. I bet Julie would
be fine with it if you are.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.198
Or not. Whatever.
Just let me know.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.742
People loving
people, right, man?

31:52.995 --> 31:54.412
I love you.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.080
Hi, there.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.000
I'm ready for that drink now.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.002
Okay.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.171
You'd be there to monitor
the whole thing.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.595
You know, honey, I clipped an
article in recipes and things

32:10.679 --> 32:15.600
about how overpopulation is contributing
to a general decline in male sperm count.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.977
Thanks, Mom.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.897
You know what I was thinking, sweetie?
Tommy's an only child.

32:21.982 --> 32:24.609
Yeah, that might be
the problem right there.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.361
His whole family
might have bad sperm.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.738
But he's lucky he made it.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.658
Hi!

32:32.743 --> 32:33.993
How are you?

32:34.077 --> 32:35.202
Good.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.954
Thanks for getting it.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.083
Oh, yeah, pork
fried rice there.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.962
Wait a second. I was... Oh, okay,
I know what I was gonna say.

32:45.047 --> 32:48.174
Okay, you know
our little problem,

32:48.258 --> 32:50.760
our very personal
and private problem?

32:50.844 --> 32:53.429
Well, it has nothing
to do with me.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.307
I don't need to put hemorrhoid
cream on my ball sack, Wanda.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.434
I don't need
to eat hot peppers.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.354
And I don't need to have a camera
shoved up my hole, darling.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.482
My sperm is perfectly fine.

33:04.566 --> 33:08.402
Why? Because I say that it is.
End of discussion.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.862
Let's eat.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.322
Food.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.157
Who can deny science like that?

33:13.241 --> 33:15.951
Okay, you want science?
I'll give you some science.

33:16.036 --> 33:20.873
You know that softball team I played on?
There was no softball team. Softball.

33:20.957 --> 33:24.627
I drove to a sperm bank,
and I donated sperm.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.587
I did. Twenty times.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.215
And each time, they
paid me cold hard cash.

33:29.299 --> 33:33.594
They wouldn't very well pay me good
money for bad sperm, would they?

33:33.679 --> 33:35.930
See how that works?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.058
Now let's eat. God!

33:39.142 --> 33:40.267
You did what?

33:40.352 --> 33:41.727
What?

33:41.812 --> 33:43.604
Tommy, what did you just say?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.360
I fell in love
with a gorgeous woman

33:49.444 --> 33:53.531
who deserved an amazingly
expensive engagement ring

33:53.615 --> 33:58.494
that I couldn't afford. And at 85 bucks
a pop, honey, it just seemed like...

33:58.578 --> 34:01.706
Tommy, you have children.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.958
Twenty children out there.

34:04.042 --> 34:04.959
At least.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.294
Thanks, Dad.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.589
You don't understand. I gave 20 samples.
That doesn't necessarily...

34:10.674 --> 34:14.635
It doesn't
necessarily mean that...

34:14.719 --> 34:16.429
No, I am sure that
most of that sperm

34:16.513 --> 34:18.931
is sitting right there
in that bank right now.

34:19.014 --> 34:22.016
Tommy, you have children.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.480
Oh, Tommy.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.485
Come on, Clark, you understand what
I was trying to do, don't you?

34:32.571 --> 34:33.987
You get it, right?

34:34.072 --> 34:38.033
I understand completely, Tommy.

34:38.118 --> 34:42.246
I understand that you bought
my daughter's engagement ring

34:42.330 --> 34:43.914
with beat off money.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.418
Got her a cum diamond.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.677
Pasadena Andrology and
Cryobank. May I help you?

34:56.762 --> 34:59.597
Hey, how're you doing? I'm
here 'cause I need some sperm.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.850
Okay. I could set you up with one
of our sales reps and they...

35:02.934 --> 35:05.227
You know what? That's
not gonna be necessary.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.396
I actually just need
some of my own sperm.

35:07.481 --> 35:11.400
Your own sperm? I think we can
cut out the middle man here.

35:11.485 --> 35:15.321
No, no. I'm a donor. I donated
some sperm about five years ago,

35:15.405 --> 35:18.324
and I was hoping to get that back.
I hope there's some left.

35:18.408 --> 35:19.784
What's your name, buddy?

35:19.868 --> 35:21.952
Thomas Macklin.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.624
What do you know?
We have one batch left.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.169
Yeah! That is great.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.672
You know what? You guys
paid me $85 per batch,

35:33.757 --> 35:35.841
and I feel that it's
only right for me to...

35:35.926 --> 35:37.885
Oops, I'm sorry.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.262
It looks like
we already sold it.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.265
My bad.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.475
To-to who?

35:44.559 --> 35:45.810
To whom?

35:45.894 --> 35:47.311
Seriously?

35:47.395 --> 35:48.854
I don't know if that's right.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.272
You're right. It's "to whom."

35:50.357 --> 35:52.441
It's whom? Okay.

35:52.526 --> 35:57.196
Anyway, we sold it to this
couple three weeks ago.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.033
We're performing the
insemination on dee-dee-dee-dee,

36:01.117 --> 36:03.118
Monday.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.205
Whatever it is they're paying
you, I'll give you double now.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.667
This isn't eBay, sir. We don't get
into bidding wars over sperm.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.836
Okay. You know what?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.463
I don't wanna have to do
this 'cause I'm not a dick,

36:14.548 --> 36:18.217
but it just so happens that I'm a good
personal friend of Kevin Baldrey, the manager.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.552
You hear that, Lyle?

36:19.636 --> 36:21.512
Is that right?

36:21.596 --> 36:23.848
He's a personal friend
of Kevin Baldrey.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.433
I'd like to speak
to him right now.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.395
You and Kev aren't so close, otherwise
you'd know he doesn't work here.

36:29.479 --> 36:32.815
He got fired for putting hidden
cameras in the masturbatories.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.192
What? He...

36:35.277 --> 36:38.529
He hid them in the smoke detectors so
he could videotape guys jerking off,

36:38.613 --> 36:40.447
and he put them
on the Internet.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.241
Are you saying that...

36:42.325 --> 36:44.910
There's only one
way to find out.

36:44.995 --> 36:48.831
Looks like that website's back up
now that Kevy fled to Amsterdam.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.416
Oh, really? Check that out.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.626
Yep. There you are.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.753
Macklin.

36:54.838 --> 36:58.382
So much for the theory that left
handers are more intelligent.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.259
Sir, back away from the desk.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.052
Can I see?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.388
Do you always make that
face when you climax?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.890
You look like a baby burp.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.231
Get him out of here. Jeez.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.820
Say hi to Kev for me.

37:25.035 --> 37:28.662
♪ Happiness starts
With a smile ♪

37:28.747 --> 37:30.289

37:30.373 --> 37:32.333

37:32.417 --> 37:36.045
How are you doing? I'm looking
for a Mrs. Leslie Jenkins.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.838
I'm Leslie Jenkins.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.506
I'm sorry. I thought that...

37:39.591 --> 37:42.509
It's alright.
It's a Southern name.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.844
Do I know you?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.554
No, you don't.

37:45.639 --> 37:48.515
I'm Tommy Macklin.
I'm your sperm donor.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.186
Oh. Oh!

37:52.270 --> 37:54.730
Can I sit down with you and
your wife for a minute?

37:54.814 --> 37:57.399
Honey, come here!
You're gonna love this!

38:02.113 --> 38:05.032
Jeffrey, this is Tommy Macklin.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.325
How're you doing?

38:06.409 --> 38:10.537
Tommy Macklin?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.498
Do you have a light beer?

38:12.582 --> 38:15.125
Then we found out
my sperm was no good.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.670
It caused a lot of stress
in our relationship

38:17.754 --> 38:20.339
because obviously we wanna
have a baby naturally.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.591
We don't know anything
about naturally.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.510
Not an option.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.346
Yeah. But I don't understand.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.181
Between the two of you guys,

38:29.265 --> 38:31.809
you've got twice as much
sperm as most couples.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.938
Twice as much? More like ten times as
much with the human fire hose here.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.233
I've learned to take my contacts
out, if you know what I mean.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.361
It's like stepping on a full
tube of toothpaste with you.

38:42.445 --> 38:46.782
That's wild. So, why don't you
just use some of Jeffrey's sperm?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.159
No, no, no. No.

38:49.244 --> 38:52.079
My family has more alcoholics
than Celebrity Rehab.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.331
Plus he's OCD and ADD.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.835
Mildly. Anyway, we wouldn't pass my
DNA on to my worst enemy's baby,

38:57.919 --> 38:59.461
much less our own.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.506
Okay. So then what
about yours, Leslie?

39:02.590 --> 39:07.219
That was plan A. But as it turns out,
my sperm is... what's the word they used?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.054
Confused.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.723
My sperm is confused, too.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.391
I cannot believe that.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.435
We saw the pictures.
It was crazy.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.271
You know what? I am confident
we can work something out.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.107
I'm happy to reimburse
you for any expenses,

39:20.191 --> 39:23.736
and for the cost of
finding a new donor.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.864
Well, that's very sweet,
Tommy, but to be honest

39:26.948 --> 39:29.408
we're quite happy
with the donor we chose.

39:29.492 --> 39:34.079
See, Leslie has a hang up about having
a baby that looks like him. Shallow.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.914
Guilty as charged.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.875
When we found out
he couldn't produce,

39:37.959 --> 39:40.627
we started looking for a
donor with similar features.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.465
And in the end we,
well, we landed on you.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.384
What about $2,000?
That seems fair.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.803
I just really need
that sperm back.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.765
Tommy, I'm really sorry,

39:52.849 --> 39:57.311
but to find the right donor, I don't think
we could go through that process again.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.105
We've never had more arguments.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.857
I thought we were
gonna break up.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.109
We almost did. But
we didn't, did we?

40:04.194 --> 40:06.862
No. Tommy, if there's one
thing I know, it's this.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.906
Love will find a way.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.658
It worked for us
and it will work for you.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.703
In fact, Leslie, why don't you
show Tommy some of the runners up?

40:14.788 --> 40:17.289
There's some guys in there
that look a little like you.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.792
You could tell your wife
you got your sperm back.

40:19.876 --> 40:23.670
Maybe slip a little something to the doctor.
She'd never know, so.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.632
Anyway, I've gotta get
jogging before nightfall.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.342
Pleasure meeting you.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.010
Best of luck.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.096
I'll get the folder for you.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.483
I can get you your sperm back.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.276
But I thought
we just said that...

40:46.361 --> 40:48.821
Come inside.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.199
Goddammit, Tommy. I feel horrible
about this. I really do.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.159
Jeffrey said...

40:54.244 --> 40:56.662
Forget Jeffrey. I wear the
pants in this relationship.

40:56.746 --> 40:58.622
And I would like to see
you have your family.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.666
Really?

41:00.750 --> 41:03.377
Yes. I'm sure we can reach
some kind of mutual agreement.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.505
It's simple, isn't it? You want
your sperm back, and I want you.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.590
Jeffrey always says
I'm a narcissist.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.551
That's probably why
I'm so attracted to you.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.553
It'd be like having
sex with myself.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.513
Having sex?

41:14.597 --> 41:17.057
I want to be inside you, Tommy.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.725
What?

41:18.810 --> 41:22.271
I want to enter you.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.314
Are you-are you
not getting this?

41:24.399 --> 41:25.816
I...

41:25.900 --> 41:27.901
Have you ever had
anal sex, Tommy?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.987
I can't say that I have.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.906
It's like getting your prostate checked.
Have you done that?

41:32.991 --> 41:35.659
You should. Detection
equals prevention.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.411
Okay, okay.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.830
Come on, Tom. We're guys here.

41:39.914 --> 41:43.417
Let's do this.
Don't be so homophobic.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.252
I'm not homophobic.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.171
You're afraid to have sex
with another man.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.840
It doesn't get more
homophobic than that.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.967
I don't think you're
using that word right.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.428
All right. I'll tell
you what I'll do.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.889
You enter me.

41:56.973 --> 41:59.099
What the hell?
I'm feeling generous.

41:59.184 --> 42:03.395
It's my final offer, Tom.
What do you say?

42:05.899 --> 42:09.193
I say fuck him. It's just a hole.
Stick it in.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.236
Can we be serious, please?

42:11.321 --> 42:14.239
Or let him fuck you. Who gives a shit?
Fuck or be fucked.

42:14.324 --> 42:17.075
Close your eyes, stick it
in, and think of baseball.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.036
That'll make it last longer.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.537
What do you got to lose?

42:20.622 --> 42:22.998
I can think
of a few things, Wade!

42:23.082 --> 42:25.209
Shit, I would do it.
But everybody knows

42:25.293 --> 42:26.752
that gay guys
don't like fat people.

42:26.836 --> 42:30.130
They're "fatophobic."
"Plumpophobic."

42:30.215 --> 42:33.926
"Plumpophobia" or whatever. Have you
ever seen a gay fat guy before?

42:34.010 --> 42:36.929
No, they don't exist.
They're like unicorns.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.598
Have you ever seen
a fat unicorn before?

42:39.682 --> 42:40.849
Me either.

42:40.934 --> 42:42.726
Help me!

42:42.810 --> 42:45.187
When they said you couldn't
have your sperm back,

42:45.271 --> 42:47.814
they robbed you of your future.
Right?

42:47.899 --> 42:50.484
And you have every
right to steal it back.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.903
Are you talking about
robbing a sperm bank?

42:52.987 --> 42:54.696
"A" double right, you bet I am.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.406
No, that's crazy.

42:56.491 --> 42:57.574
Crazy? Or brilliant?

42:57.659 --> 42:58.992
Crazy.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.452
Brilliantly crazy.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.162
No, just crazy.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.998
And brilliant. Don't
think about yourself.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.750
Think about your unborn child.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.460
If you don't do something soon,

43:08.544 --> 43:10.420
the last good seed
you have on Earth

43:10.505 --> 43:12.798
is gonna be implanted
deep inside some surrogate.

43:12.882 --> 43:16.468
And good luck getting it back then.
Fuck or be fucked, Tommy.

43:16.552 --> 43:19.346
Fuck or be fucked, Tommy.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.557
No, wait a second. How are
we gonna rob a sperm bank?

43:22.642 --> 43:24.393
I've been thinking about this.

43:24.477 --> 43:26.228
I know just the guy
who can help us.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.355
Walk with me.

43:41.244 --> 43:42.995
How do you know this guy again?

43:43.079 --> 43:44.579
How do we know this guy?

43:44.664 --> 43:47.874
Shut up, Zig Zag.
Keep your mouth shut.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.210
This whole thing was my
idea in the first place.

43:50.295 --> 43:53.046
What? Your idea?

43:53.131 --> 43:56.925
You think you can come up with a
crazily brilliant idea like this?

43:57.010 --> 44:00.554
Okay. The guys in the meat
department introduce me to him.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.264
Apparently he's the real deal.

44:02.348 --> 44:03.849
Former bag man
for the Indian mafia.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.851
What does that mean?

44:05.935 --> 44:08.520
That's racist. They like to
be called Native-Americans.

44:08.604 --> 44:11.398
No, he's Indian. Dot head
Indian, not feather Indian.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.816
That's even more racist.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.068
You're a racist.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.863
Bag man means you fuck with him,
you end up with a bag on your hip.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.991
- Bag on your hip? What the fuck does that mean?
- You shit in a bag.

44:21.075 --> 44:26.330
And then they tell me that they can't
even sell me back my own sperm.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.707
And then they kick me out.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.667
Yeah, and they pepper
sprayed me in the face.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.962
Pushed me into the bushes.
I have prickers everywhere.

44:34.047 --> 44:36.173
I mean, if I don't
get my sperm back, man,

44:36.257 --> 44:38.425
my marriage is over.

44:38.509 --> 44:41.762
You know, these bastards
are assholes,

44:41.846 --> 44:44.014
and they're stealing my future,

44:44.098 --> 44:48.894
and they're taking away my constitutional
right to do whatever I want

44:48.978 --> 44:50.395
with my own sperm.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.772
You know?

44:51.856 --> 44:54.107
Do you see what I'm saying?

44:54.192 --> 44:56.234
Yes, I do.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.904
You're saying you bought
your wife's engagement ring

44:58.988 --> 45:00.364
with beat off money.

45:01.824 --> 45:04.576
Classic, right?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.287
I like you.

45:07.372 --> 45:09.206
You're a married man.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.583
I always want
to be married man.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.460
But I never found love.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.629
What can you do?

45:15.713 --> 45:16.922
I will help you.

45:17.006 --> 45:18.215
Hey, all right.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.424
Thank you, Ron Jon. See?

45:19.509 --> 45:20.926
Thanks, man.

45:21.010 --> 45:22.302
Cost is 5000.

45:22.387 --> 45:24.930
5000? I really had no idea.

45:25.014 --> 45:27.140
Could you excuse us.
Give us a sec.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.977
What are you doing?
You're blowing the deal.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.063
$5000 to rob a sperm bank?

45:33.147 --> 45:34.356
How much do you think it costs?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.108
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

45:36.192 --> 45:38.443
Are you gonna put a price
tag on your family?

45:38.528 --> 45:40.195
Shit.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.406
You must have a rich
uncle around somewhere.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.825
I've got $11,000 saved up
in the house fund.

45:44.909 --> 45:48.245
I could possibly borrow five and pay
it back before Audrey found out.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.247
Now you're talking sense.

45:50.331 --> 45:51.665
This is it.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.999
Now be cool.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.502
So, we were just chatting.

45:55.586 --> 45:59.172
And we feel like, yeah,
sure, yeah, good.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.591
What about $3000?

46:01.676 --> 46:04.553
Mr. Macklin, make no mistake.

46:04.637 --> 46:06.972
We are committing
a felony here.

46:07.056 --> 46:11.643
There is grave risk involved.
Do you understand me?

46:11.727 --> 46:14.521
Yeah, 5000 then.
5000 seems good.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.730
Very nice!

46:15.815 --> 46:17.607
Very, very, very nice!

46:17.692 --> 46:20.777
- Thank you for your time.
- Looks like we have a deal.

46:20.862 --> 46:23.447
Dude, were you seriously
in the Indian mafia?

46:30.079 --> 46:31.913
What the fuck, man?

46:31.998 --> 46:33.498
I never said anything.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.543
You have to know
every fucking thing.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.586
Okay, fine.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.379
Okay, Mr. Nosy.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.048
If you must know,
back in Mumbai,

46:42.133 --> 46:44.885
I was the best second story
man in the business.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.386
What business?

46:46.471 --> 46:49.139
The stealing
shit business, okay?

46:49.223 --> 46:53.143
- Okay.
- What is your name?

46:53.227 --> 46:54.436
Zig Zag.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.104
What is so funny, Zig Zag?

46:56.189 --> 46:58.273
I was just kinda laughing

46:58.357 --> 47:03.653
at what the whole "Indian" organized
crime thing was all about.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.406
What? You don't think Indian
crime can be organized?

47:06.491 --> 47:08.283
Indians are very organized.

47:08.367 --> 47:12.037
No, I'm sure. I just had
this, like, idea in my head

47:12.121 --> 47:15.248
about all these Indian mob
dudes, sitting around,

47:15.333 --> 47:18.043
like being all non-violent
with each other.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.378
'Cause you think about,
like, Gandhi, right?

47:20.463 --> 47:22.047
I mean, he was, like...

47:22.131 --> 47:25.091
Should I show you
how nonviolent I can be?

47:25.176 --> 47:27.219
No!

47:27.303 --> 47:29.930
You think Indians can only drive
a cab and fix your computer?

47:30.014 --> 47:31.765
Well, let me
tell you something.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.559
I did drive a cab! And I
can fix your computer,

47:34.644 --> 47:37.020
but I can also cut your throat!

47:37.104 --> 47:38.730
Shall I show you, Mr. Zig Zag?

47:38.814 --> 47:41.691
No, I feel like I got it.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.860
Yeah, I feel like I understand.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.695
Yeah, I was just pretty baked.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.448
Cool off, man, okay? Cool off.

47:48.533 --> 47:49.783
Everybody cool off.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.744
Hey, it's cool.

47:52.828 --> 47:54.037
Let us drink.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.338
Let us drink
to a successful mission.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.173
What is this?

48:05.258 --> 48:07.300
Just drink it, god damn it.
Everybody, "What is it?"

48:07.385 --> 48:08.593
"What is it? What is it?"

48:08.678 --> 48:09.970
Okay, come on!

48:10.054 --> 48:12.889
To success!

48:23.109 --> 48:26.444
I will get you your sperm
back, Mr. Macklin.

48:26.529 --> 48:29.573
That much, I guarantee.

48:41.294 --> 48:43.336
So you just must be
totally pissed.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.589
Yeah, I was furious at first.

48:45.673 --> 48:47.632
I mean, he's got
kids out there.

48:47.717 --> 48:50.010
But then I thought, why
not just go down there

48:50.094 --> 48:53.054
and see if they have any of his
good sperm left for us to use.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.347
And?

48:54.432 --> 48:56.224
It was five years ago.

48:56.309 --> 48:59.102
They told him they'd look,
but it didn't look good.

49:02.565 --> 49:04.190
Billy, no!

49:04.275 --> 49:06.026
If you keep drowning
James, I swear to God,

49:06.110 --> 49:07.527
I gonna come over there
and drown you right back!

49:07.612 --> 49:09.613
It's not James.

49:09.697 --> 49:12.866
Well, who can tell,
you little sewer rat?

49:14.327 --> 49:15.785
All right, that's it.

49:15.870 --> 49:17.287
Get over here!

49:18.748 --> 49:22.542
Oh, Allison, she's so adorable.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.503
What's her name?

49:25.588 --> 49:27.714
Well, we wanted to name
her something Chinese,

49:27.798 --> 49:31.551
but also, you know, American,
so we went with Jackie Chan.

49:31.636 --> 49:35.013
Jackie Chan Finnerman. Nice.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.098
Wait...

49:37.183 --> 49:40.143
Stop it! C'mon, stop it!

49:42.355 --> 49:43.938
God, she's so quiet.

49:44.023 --> 49:46.107
Yeah, she's really quiet.
She never cries.

49:46.192 --> 49:48.026
Yeah, I've heard that
about those babies.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.903
Why does everybody know so
much about Asian babies?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.446
Did I miss a class
or something?

49:51.530 --> 49:53.281
They're just like
American babies.

49:53.366 --> 49:54.866
Only better.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.910
I heard they're also
really musical.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.079
You should totally get her
a piano, like, right now.

49:59.163 --> 50:00.580
Well, I already
got her a violin.

50:00.665 --> 50:02.666
She doesn't even
have fingers yet.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.167
So, just out of curiosity,

50:04.251 --> 50:05.960
how much did it cost
to adopt her?

50:06.045 --> 50:07.879
About $10,000
when you add it all up.

50:09.507 --> 50:10.590
Did you want to hold her?

50:10.675 --> 50:12.008
Oh, I'd love to.

50:14.011 --> 50:16.262
Hi, Jackie Chan.

50:16.347 --> 50:17.013
Hi.

50:19.016 --> 50:22.894
Oh, princess. Yeah. Hi.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.536
There he is,
our five-star general.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.189
Okay.

51:08.274 --> 51:10.483
I have done a complete
stakeout of the target.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.526
Nothing to it.

51:11.610 --> 51:12.902
Piece of cake.

51:12.987 --> 51:15.113
- Oh, that's great.
- Awesome.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.824
Each person will have
a special job.

51:17.908 --> 51:21.995
You. Because you are small like
a woman, you will be wheel man.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.289
Drive only. No talk.

51:24.373 --> 51:25.206
A woman.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.125
No talk.

51:27.209 --> 51:28.918
You.

51:29.003 --> 51:32.505
If shit go down, and all
fuck break loose...

51:36.594 --> 51:39.471
you are trigger man.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.723
I'm not gonna
shoot this gun, so...

51:41.807 --> 51:43.266
Let me tell you something.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.518
I have two strikes against me.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.396
One more and I go
to prison for life.

51:48.481 --> 51:52.525
If we are caught, you must shoot me.
Do you understand?

51:52.610 --> 51:54.694
I'm not gonna
shoot you, Mr. Jon.

51:54.779 --> 51:56.196
Christ, I'll shoot him.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.697
Sorry.

51:57.782 --> 51:58.948
So here is the plan.

51:59.033 --> 52:01.785
This is the sperm bank.

52:01.869 --> 52:05.705
This is barber shop
right next door.

52:05.790 --> 52:08.333
Wait a minute. Just, sorry,

52:08.417 --> 52:09.834
but wouldn't it make more sense

52:09.919 --> 52:12.378
if we made the comb
the barber shop

52:12.463 --> 52:15.465
and the cream the sperm bank?
I'm just saying.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.800
Yeah, I'm with Tom on this one.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.760
Okay, fine, fine.

52:18.844 --> 52:23.807
This is barber shop,
and this is sperm bank.

52:23.891 --> 52:27.435
And this is the liquor store
across the street.

52:30.606 --> 52:32.649
What?

52:32.733 --> 52:36.027
Wouldn't it be better if Zig Zag's
beer was the liqour store...

52:36.111 --> 52:38.655
and this ketchup bottle
was something else?

52:49.625 --> 52:55.296
Liquor store, barber shop,
sperm bank. Any questions?

52:57.132 --> 52:59.425
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's good, yeah.

52:59.510 --> 53:03.930
Okay, you and wheel man will
arrive early, dressed as plumber.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.518
You're gonna have your name
on the plumbing truck?

53:08.602 --> 53:09.853
Good point.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.941
You two will enter
barber shop and go

53:15.025 --> 53:17.151
to the employee rest room.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.654
You will open sky light.

53:19.738 --> 53:24.158
Then you will plant special
tools I need for job.

53:24.243 --> 53:28.705
Soon it will be dark and
time for me to take over.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.456
From the roof
of the liquor store,

53:30.541 --> 53:32.792
I will slide on power
lines like Ninja,

53:32.877 --> 53:34.878
I will drop in
through the sky light,

53:34.962 --> 53:36.796
take the jack hammer

53:36.881 --> 53:39.382
and blast my way
into the sperm bank.

53:39.466 --> 53:42.135
Meanwhile, rest of team
will be outside,

53:42.219 --> 53:44.345
providing noise cover
for jack hammer.

53:50.644 --> 53:53.438
I don't play guitar.

53:53.522 --> 53:54.981
That's true.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.733
But you do play
the accordion, right?

53:56.817 --> 53:58.318
When I was nine. Shut up, Wade.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.115
Once inside sperm bank,

54:04.199 --> 54:06.576
I will use special lock picking
kit to open the vault.

54:06.660 --> 54:11.998
With special lock picking kit,
I can open any lock, anytime.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.625
And, just like that...

54:13.709 --> 54:15.209
you are a daddy.

54:15.294 --> 54:16.836
Did I tell you
this guy was the best?

54:16.921 --> 54:18.338
Sorry, I just
have one question.

54:18.422 --> 54:21.049
If you can open
any lock, anytime,

54:21.133 --> 54:24.177
then why not skip the Ninja
routine, the jack hammer

54:24.261 --> 54:26.137
and the 80s hair band,

54:26.221 --> 54:28.640
and just pick the lock on
the door to the sperm bank?

54:28.724 --> 54:30.558
Yeah, if you just
use the lock picking kit,

54:30.643 --> 54:34.687
you can pick the lock on the
door to the sperm bank.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.689
I like this guy.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.816
He is a good one
to have on the team.

54:38.901 --> 54:41.402
Great new plan. I like it.

54:41.487 --> 54:45.490
Okay. I would call this plan

54:45.574 --> 54:47.951
Operation Desert Sperm.

55:00.005 --> 55:01.923
Hey, wow.

55:02.007 --> 55:05.969
- Guess what?
- Just really quick, I wanna say something.

55:06.053 --> 55:08.721
I know I have screwed
some things up lately.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.391
But don't worry, because...

55:11.475 --> 55:12.809
I am on the case.

55:12.893 --> 55:16.980
Guess what?

55:17.064 --> 55:17.939
You're pregnant?

55:19.233 --> 55:21.109
Yes, yes, yes.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.277
Oh, Tommy, Tommy.

55:23.362 --> 55:25.613
I want to adopt.

55:25.698 --> 55:27.615
Adopt?

55:27.700 --> 55:29.951
I went by the adoption agency
and got some information.

55:30.035 --> 55:31.744
It's the perfect
solution for us.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.580
Yeah, but the sperm bank
might still have...

55:34.665 --> 55:36.833
Tommy, you said they
didn't think they had any.

55:36.917 --> 55:38.710
They said they're
checking the warehouse.

55:38.794 --> 55:40.545
I held Allison's baby today.

55:40.629 --> 55:42.880
And I just looked into
those big, beautiful eyes.

55:42.965 --> 55:45.675
Oh, my gosh, Tommy.
I just fell in love.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.969
Look it doesn't matter
how we get a baby.

55:48.053 --> 55:50.221
Let's just start a family.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.306
Allison's baby
is Chinese, right?

55:52.391 --> 55:54.100
Oh, she's so delicious.

55:56.311 --> 55:57.937
What's wrong?

55:58.022 --> 55:59.022
Nothing.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.523
I'm half Chinese!

56:00.607 --> 56:02.817
Thank you.
I know that, I just...

56:02.901 --> 56:07.238
But out of curiosity, do they
have any American kids there?

56:07.322 --> 56:09.574
Or even, like half Chinese
half American kids?

56:09.658 --> 56:13.995
Babe, American babies are ridiculously
expensive and impossible to get.

56:14.079 --> 56:15.955
There used to be
tons of Russian babies,

56:16.040 --> 56:18.124
but one of them went a little
crazy, so that was that.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.460
India won't let their babies out.
We could go Ethiopian?

56:20.544 --> 56:21.878
What do they have, like a menu?

56:21.962 --> 56:23.171
So I did some quick research.

56:23.255 --> 56:25.048
Of course you did.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.134
And the Chinese babies
are the easiest ones to get.

56:28.218 --> 56:31.387
Do you have some kind of Chinese
issue I should know about?

56:32.806 --> 56:34.515
You love Chinese food!

56:34.600 --> 56:36.350
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna eat the baby.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.269
You better not.

56:38.353 --> 56:40.480
You know what? Let me just
take a piss, really quick.

56:40.564 --> 56:41.898
Hold on, two seconds.

57:05.798 --> 57:07.799
I guess the Great Wall
is pretty sweet.

57:07.883 --> 57:10.676
Oh, thank you!

57:12.471 --> 57:14.514
I mean, you're sure about this?

57:14.598 --> 57:17.642
I've never been more sure about
anything in my entire life.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.227
Okay, then.

57:20.437 --> 57:21.813
You look disappointed.

57:21.897 --> 57:25.233
I'm not disappointed.

57:25.317 --> 57:27.527
This is not exactly how I
imagined it would work out,

57:27.611 --> 57:29.153
but maybe you're right.

57:29.238 --> 57:31.030
Let's explore it,
How does it even work?

57:31.115 --> 57:34.200
Well, when you add it all up,
it's about $10,000.

57:34.284 --> 57:36.702
But I figure we can just borrow
it from the house fund, right?

57:37.788 --> 57:39.997
Yes, yes we can.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.458
I love you, Tommy.

57:42.543 --> 57:44.460
I love you, honey.

57:50.259 --> 57:51.759
It's off.

57:51.844 --> 57:53.553
- What's off?
- The robbery, it's off.

57:53.637 --> 57:55.096
Shut the fuck up.

57:55.180 --> 57:56.305
No, seriously man.

57:56.390 --> 57:58.724
We've gotta cancel it.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.226
But I already bought
the ski masks.

58:00.310 --> 58:01.727
It's too risky.
I can't get caught.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.521
What about the baby?

58:03.605 --> 58:05.731
Audrey decided we're
gonna adopt a Chinese baby.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.526
Audrey decided you're
getting a Chinese baby.

58:08.610 --> 58:10.444
When did you decide
to give up on America?

58:10.529 --> 58:11.946
She decided.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.739
We decided.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.242
She just decided first
and then I decided later.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.619
I'm tired of these Chinese.
They're making everything.

58:18.704 --> 58:20.788
Shirts, the watch
and the pants.

58:20.873 --> 58:22.456
Now they're gonna make
our babies?

58:22.541 --> 58:24.375
I'm sick of this
outsourcing shit.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.210
Wait a second.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.713
We were gonna outsource
our robbery to this Indian.

58:28.797 --> 58:32.091
Besides, this way we're
helping orphans and shit.

58:32.176 --> 58:33.759
Giving them a second chance.

58:33.844 --> 58:35.636
Oh, we already gave them
a second chance.

58:35.721 --> 58:37.263
Remember Pearl Harbor?

58:37.347 --> 58:39.140
Never forget, man.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.017
Fine, get your Chinese baby.
I'm over it.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.811
You know what? I hear
they're pretty damn smart.

58:43.896 --> 58:45.980
Yeah, and fucking expensive.

58:46.064 --> 58:49.650
We gotta get my $5000
back from your Mr. Ron Jon.

58:49.735 --> 58:52.862
Okay, well I don't think
Mr. Ron Jon's an Indian giver.

58:52.946 --> 58:55.281
No shit. I am the Indian giver.

58:55.365 --> 58:57.450
How could you
be the Indian giver?

58:57.534 --> 58:59.410
I'm not having
this conversation.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.915
Okay, listen.
Stick to the plan.

59:03.999 --> 59:05.374
Play to his sympathies.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.043
Make him feel guilty,
all right?

59:13.217 --> 59:15.426
What the hell?
You're a day early.

59:15.510 --> 59:16.969
Hey, we need to talk.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.763
Okay, come in.

59:18.847 --> 59:21.515
Getting in shape
for the big job.

59:24.645 --> 59:27.980
Listen, Mr. Jon,
I have some bad news.

59:28.065 --> 59:30.483
I have to cancel the job.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.777
Okay, fine. Job is canceled.

59:32.861 --> 59:34.487
Just like that?

59:34.571 --> 59:36.155
Just like that.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.033
C'mon. We can drink
to canceled job. Come.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.494
Okay, let's do this.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.830
The good stuff, too, I see

59:44.915 --> 59:48.376
Hey, yes. Nothing but the best
for my friends. C'mon now.

59:48.460 --> 59:49.460
To canceled job.

59:54.174 --> 59:57.134
Indians love Scotch.

59:57.219 --> 59:58.678
And cocaine!

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:05.685
She don't lie.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.936
Well, heck if I do.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.856
That's a great TV!

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.316
Oh, you like it?

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:14.694
Voice activated. Check it out.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.821
Shut the fuck up!

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.784
I gotta get me on of those.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:25.204
Hey, those weights
look pretty new, too.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:28.666
Listen, how much of that
$5000 have you spent?

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.126
5000?

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.877
Yeah, I gave you $5000.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.921
I guess I spent $5000.

01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:35.548
You what?

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:39.093
No, no! Man...

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.096
The reason I had to cancel
the job is because...

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.974
I have an emergency, and
I need that money back.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.851
Well, what is the emergency?

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:49.895
Well... it's my mother.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.647
She's ill,

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:54.442
- and if she doesn't get a new...
- Kidney...

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:58.195
transplant, then she'll die.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.115
That is very, very sad.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:04.785
My own mother,
she died of liver failure.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:09.832
I cannot promise anything, but
I will see what I can do.

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.376
All right.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.837
Yes, Mom, we're really excited.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:17.465
Of course she'll speak English.
We'll teach her.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:20.259
No, we haven't come up
with names yet. Hold on.

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:29.894
Mom, I gotta go.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:33.189
Audrey, I'm home.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.024
I was just down
at the bank, just now,

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.859
and it's weird, because they...

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.070
said apparently there's a
mistake that was made,

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:42.448
but not to worry, because they could
clear it up in a couple days.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.868
What... is going on?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.830
Audrey, baby...

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:51.957
What happened?
What's going on right now?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.876
Would you stop for a second?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.045
We're gonna have enough
money for the Chinese baby.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.467
You can take your Chinese baby
and shove it up your ass.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.431
They're not mine.

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:10.226
Okay, tell me.
Then whose are they?

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.398
- They're Wade's.
- Okay.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.236
Aud. Audrey...

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.657
Hey, wait!
Audrey, seriously, stop.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:29.120
Hey, Audrey, You've gotta be kidding me.
Please, stop.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.788
Stop, please!

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.706
- Hold on.
- Do you love her, Tommy?

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.792
Of course not. I love you.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.169
Then why were you jerking off
to naked picture of her?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.131
I was jerking off to naked
pictures of cantaloupes.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.258
I saw her cantaloupes, Tommy.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.760
And I'm sorry that my cantaloupes
aren't good enough for you.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.595
If only you found
me attractive,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.639
you could have jerked off
to naked pictures of me.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.558
Audrey, seriously,
they are Wade's pictures.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.476
Then how the hell did they
end up in our bathroom?

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:53.811
Well...

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.229
You know what?

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.939
Blame your friends. Who cares?

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.108
You're not man enough
to knock me up, anyway.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.370
I can't believe
you broke up with Tanya.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:12.872
I got tired of her.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.249
A man cannot live
by nipples alone.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.966
Hey, Wade, you asshole!

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:27.219
I told you to get
the pictures out of my...

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.224
She found the pictures.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.767
Oh...

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.479
You know, she's right.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.063
I got one job to do as a man,

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.982
and I can't even do that.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.109
It's just a little
crisis of confidence.

01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:43.569
It happens to everyone.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.446
Maybe we should
buy him a hooker.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.323
What's he gonna do
with a hooker?

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:48.908
Oh, that's right.
He can't get it up.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.785
Zig Zag, I can get it up, dude.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.579
He can get it up.
He just can't come.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.831
I can come!

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:59.293
Yeah, sure. He can come. But nothing comes out.
Just puffs of air.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.214
Would you guys shut up?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.174
If I lose Audrey, I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.592
C'mon, don't talk like that.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.385
She loves you and you love her.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.221
And she knows that you'll
do anything for her.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.765
But I haven't done
everything, have I?

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.267
There's only one thing left I
could do to make this right.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.311
And I'm gonna do it.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.896
You're gonna have sex
with that gay guy?

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.397
What?

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:23.108
No, I'm gonna go back
to Pasadena,

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.401
and rob that bank.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:25.486
Yeah, you are!

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.154
Rob a bank?

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:28.656
Here's the deal.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.574
On Monday, the last
batch of sperm

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:33.118
that I have left in the
world will be gone forever.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.913
But tomorrow night,
before that happens,

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:38.999
we're gonna go in there,
and steal that shit back.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.502
We're pulling a bank job,

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.462
a sperm bank job.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.047
What do you guys say?
Who's with me?

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.007
I'm with you, Tomahawk!

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.802
- Zig Zag.
- Aces high!

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.429
Darrell? We could use
some muscle on this job.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:59.228
Right, well, I'm just
gonna run home real quick

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.356
and just grab a few
things, a few things...

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.983
for this mission.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.569
Little criminal stuff
for the mission.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.862
And then I'll meet you guys
at the designated place,

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.322
at the designated time.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:11.073
Okay.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.666
Okay, Darrell's out.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.335
He said designated spot,
designated time.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.922
Zig Zag, we don't have a designated
spot, or a designated time.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:29.466
Oh.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.969
At least we don't have to cut
him in on the take, right?

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:32.928
That's good.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.476
Ron Jon! It's Wayne.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.186
Ron Jon!

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.272
How can he hear you
over that stupid TV?

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:48.319
Shut the fuck up!

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.747
- What?
- Hi.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.375
So it's back on,
and we gotta go tonight.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.085
Come in.

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:09.840
I can't do tonight,
but Wednesday might work.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:13.427
Please, Mr. Jon. I paid you a
lot of money to do this job.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.554
Hey, you canceled
the job, remember?

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:18.098
Yeah, but you never
gave me back my money.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.642
Wait.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:28.108
What is this?
You got my money in here?

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.151
Open it.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:35.282
What the... what is this?

01:06:35.367 --> 01:06:37.159
What do you mean what the fuck?

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.161
It's a kidney. You say your
mother needs a kidney.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.246
How about a little
"Thank you, Mr. Ron Jon."

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.582
Whose kidney is that?
Whose kidney is that?

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.460
Mr. Jon...

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:47.961
I don't know
how to tell you this,

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:49.630
but my mother's
perfectly healthy.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:52.091
I made that shit up
to get my money back.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.967
I see.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:56.720
I feel very sorry. I feel
very strange about this.

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.263
Whose is this?

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:02.101
What man is out there
with less body?

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.229
Listen to me, Mr. Jon, okay?

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.606
Please.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.650
I'm desperate, okay?

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.527
Please help me.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.487
I can't lose my wife.

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.739
You should have thought of
that before you lied to me.

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:17.908
What if I paid you
a shitload more money?

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.076
5000 dollars.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.036
Goddammit, look.

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:23.372
I got $4000
right there, in cash,

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.915
in this envelope right here.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:29.128
Okay, okay. All right, okay.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:33.090
I have got $40. $40.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.466
Zig Zag.

01:08:06.624 --> 01:08:09.334
What do we have here?

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:14.423
One, two, three...

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.175
I have $8.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.720
We've got $4048, okay?

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.513
So what do you say? C'mon.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.768
I'm not sure
if I can trust my team..

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:29.520
Okay, you know what? Let's
sweeten the deal a little bit.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:33.192
Okay? What do you say to that?

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.702
You know my weakness.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.370
Let's do it!

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.663
Let's do it.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:56.881
She's your ex-girlfriend?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.383
Yep.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.010
And your ex-girlfriend...

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:03.388
And what about you, Ziplock?

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.224
I practice abstinence.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:09.185
Good. I would not like a
woman you're attached.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.687
When do I get her?

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.689
You get her. What?

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.858
Do you think she would like me?
Does she like beards?

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.319
Oh, shit. Did you think that...

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:21.198
Tomorrow, noon.
We will drop her off.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.367
Noon is good for me.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.077
Noon can work.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.167
Tommy?

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:37.923
Tommy, I'm home!

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.220
First message.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.974
Hey, honey. I just wanna tell you
that I've got it all figured out.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:48.767
I am gonna get my sperm back

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:51.270
and we are gonna
have our family, okay?

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.981
I gotta go, but I will
see you tonight.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:56.191
Wait for me! Let's go
steal that jizz!

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.277
Wade, shut up!

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.112
Oh, my God.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.287
Where the fuck is Ron Jon, man?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.164
Will you stop asking that?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:13.125
Something's not right.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.335
Jesus, Zig Zag.
Stop smoking pot.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.004
It's making you paranoid
you douche.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.714
Dude, it's for my glaucoma.

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.799
Do you really have glaucoma?

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.384
Early stages.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:25.596
Hey, dude.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.264
- Where have you been?
- Seriousy, dude.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.224
I was casing the joint.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:31.059
Good news...

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:34.062
There is no guard on duty,
and there is no alarm.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:37.065
It's almost as if they don't
expect someone to break in

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.192
and steal their own sperm back.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.155
I have to tell you,

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.449
this is the craziest fucking
job I've ever been on.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.076
Although there was
one time in India,

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:51.455
when they hired me to steal a
monkey back from a barber.

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.206
But what they
neglected to tell me

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:56.460
was how horny
this particular monkey was.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.841
Okay, back to job.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.594
We go in, we steal the semen,

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:08.680
we get out.
Ten minutes, synchronized.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.016
Okay, let's... let's do this.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.392
If the cops come,

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.853
honk three times, like this.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.482
What the fuck, dude?

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:19.942
Why did you do that?

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:22.653
That is signal
to abort mission.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:24.696
Fuck, man!

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:27.866
If you leave without us,
I will find you.,

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.952
and I will kill you.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:31.828
Let's roll.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:41.922
I don't know, Wade.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.132
I got a bad feeling
about this guy.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.176
Well, that's just because
he's a criminal.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.053
That's how you're
supposed to feel.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.224
Shit.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:56.395
Shit!

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.063
What's wrong?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.400
I can't remember
the exact combination.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.527
To the lock picking kit?

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:06.905
Yes, to the lock
picking kit, okay?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.032
Did you write it
down somewhere?

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.743
If I wrote it down, I'd have
the fucking thing open.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:12.911
Maybe it's your birthday.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.496
It's not my birthday.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.415
- Phone number.
- Don't make fun of me.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.167
- Street address?
- What the fuck does that mean?

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.712
Mother's birthday.

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.088
Could be.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.770
Don't worry,. I have an idea.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:52.117
- Bad man for the India mafia?
- That's what I was told.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.494
Okay, where do they
keep the sperm?

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.246
How the hell should I know?

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.249
Oh, shit! I just remembered
the combination!

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.043
Awesome. Great.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.961
We gotta split up so we
can cover more ground.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.158
Hello, lady.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.356
Bingo.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:12.948
Bingo.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:22.082
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Jackpot.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.584
Macklin, Macklin...

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:26.128
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.554
Bingo.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:10.273
What is this?

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.547
Okay, okay.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:44.224
Wade! Ron Jon! I got my sperm.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.852
What are you doing?

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.313
I am very lonely.
Never married.

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:51.356
We gotta get out of here.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.899
No, no, no, no.

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:56.736
Where is it?

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.491
What?

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:04.327
Don't move. Okay?

01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:05.787
No! No!

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:06.955
Don't move!

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.426
Oh, shit. Fuck. Cops.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.930
Ron Jon, that's the signal.

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:25.265
Let's go!

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.191
Okay.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.654
Shit!

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:49.122
Wade, are you okay?

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.707
Once I'm soapy.

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:54.878
- I need some mouthwash.
- I got my sperm.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.212
Awesome.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.672
Where the hell is Zig Zog?

01:17:57.757 --> 01:17:59.466
Son of a bitch!

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.843
Don't worry. I will
kill that motherfucker.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:05.847
Cops, cops, cops! Go, go!

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.809
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.269
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:12.812
Yeah, we gotta go steal a car.

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:14.064
Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:15.940
You cannot take the risk.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.150
You have to make a baby.

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:18.902
That is your job.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.195
I will go get us a car.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.821
That's grand theft auto.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:24.491
Grand theft auto.
That is how I started.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:27.118
Life of crime. Very nice.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:34.876
Can I have the addresses of all the
sperm banks in Pasadena, please?

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.879
No, this isn't a crank call.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.632
Ew, get your mind
out of the gutter.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.050
You're gonna have
to turn up here.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.968
- Which way?
- That way.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.637
Really? What is that?

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:46.763
Which way?

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:47.931
That way!

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:52.143
Wade, where is he?

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.812
My sperm's gonna fall out.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:55.730
What is that?

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:02.821
What the hell?

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:08.660
- Oh, my God.
- Come on! Let's go!

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:09.953
Get in!

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:13.915
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:23.091
What the fuck?

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.759
Please don't hurt us!

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.553
Ron Jon, what are
these people doing here?

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:28.304
This was the only car
with the key in it.

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.181
Well, pull it over!
Pull it over right now.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:32.016
I can't pull over.
They've already seen us.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:35.019
- Please don't kill us!
- We haven't seen anything.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.063
Nobody's killing anybody, okay?

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:39.190
Technically, we really
should kill them.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.567
No! No!

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:42.235
Ron Jon!

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:43.987
Okay, fine. I pull over.
Give me a minute.

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:45.989
- Dude, your sperm's melting.
- Oh, shit.

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.449
Ron Jon!

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.950
Man, I need some ice back here.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.702
This sperm is starting
to heat up.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.454
Ron Jon, pull over.
Ron Jon, get me some ice.

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.956
Is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.833
Okay, one second.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:57.959
Here you go!

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.088
It's okay.

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.842
Chill out, sperm!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.012
Oh, shit!

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:10.472
We are having company!

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.474
Oh, fuck!

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:15.101
Hold on people!
I'm going to lose him!

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:19.147
- You smell really great.
- Thank you.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:28.406
False alarm!

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:29.908
Everything's cool.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.160
- Just an ambulance.
- An ambulance?

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.578
Are you crazy?

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.954
Hey, man. You should be happy.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.748
We're home free. We made it.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.667
Congratulations. You're
going to be a daddy!

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:40.919
I am, aren't I?

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:42.587
Thank you, Ron Jon.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.422
We did it, Macklin!

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:55.099
Let us have
some liquid celebrate!

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:01.564
Ron Jon!

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.578
I think I just
had a miscarriage.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.050
Fuck. What the fuck, man?

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:30.510
Are you okay?

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:36.683
Hey, I was just coming
to get you, man.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.685
Are you okay?

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:41.062
- I will kill you!
- Oh, fuckin' hey, dude.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.481
Fuckin' hey, man!

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:44.899
I was coming back.

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.152
Freeze!

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.821
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground!

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.574
You're under arrest
for grand theft auto.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.995
You, too, asshole! Get down!

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:00.373
Tommy, fuck or be fucked, bro.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.168
Drop the bucket and get down.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.420
Fuck or be fucked!

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:09.757
Yeah!

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:11.509
You'll never catch him!

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:13.094
Fuck!

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.722
Slow down!

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.824
I need backup.
He's still running.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:50.590
Oh, it's close. It's close.
It's right around here.

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:53.593
What the fuck?

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.219
Oh, Jesus.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.764
I don't even know
those guys. C'mon!

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.100
- Wade?
- Hey Audrey, what's up?

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.393
Where's Tommy?

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:03.978
Ma'am, please keep moving.

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:05.813
He's got the sperm.
He's got the sperm.

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.231
He went that way!

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:23.289
All right, buddy. Come on out.

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:24.957
I see you.

01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:30.963
Come on out. No place to go.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:34.592
- No.
- Yeah.

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:35.968
- No.
- Yeah.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.929
- No!
- You're coming out now.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:40.264
Don't I get some...

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:43.476
I got some demands.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.436
Yeah, I got a list of demands.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.730
Okay.

01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:49.857
What do you want?

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:52.318
I need a bucket of ice.

01:23:52.403 --> 01:23:55.029
That's it. A bucket of ice.

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:56.989
How about a bucket
of chicken instead?

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.409
Hey, man. I need that ice now.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.620
Do you mind my asking
what you need the ice for?

01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:07.959
Be... because I have
to keep my sperm cold.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.544
What was that?

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.504
Because I have
to keep my sperm cold!

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:14.632
You're sperm is too hot, is it?

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:17.468
There was a break in at the
sperm bank down the street.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:22.140
God, this country just keeps
getting weirder and weirder.

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.392
- Call psychiatric.
- All right.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:28.604
Son? Is that stolen sperm
you've got there?

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:31.399
No, it's my sperm! All right?

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.359
If it's sperm he's looking for,

01:24:33.444 --> 01:24:35.570
there's gonna be plenty where he's headed.
Am I right?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:41.159
Hey, Captain. This is his wife.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:44.036
Can I talk to him? I can
get him to come out.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.663
Yeah, well you got two minutes.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:47.832
Then we're gonna
take him the hard way.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.709
Get the battering ram.

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:51.252
Bring it in.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:56.466
Tommy!

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.354
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.817
I got my sperm.

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:16.736
I know.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.780
It's been a weird
couple days, hasn't it?

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:24.619
This is the coolest thing a
guy has ever done for a girl.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.129
Look, I'm sorry I got mad at you
about the pictures of Tanya.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:37.089
I know you never would have
jerked off to them.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:39.467
No, I'm sorry I bought your
ring with beat off money.

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:42.011
And I jerked off to that stupid
picture of those cantaloupes.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.889
No, I saw the cantaloupes.
They were kinda hot.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:53.439
Audrey, I'm sorry
my sperm stopped working.

01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:56.901
Don't worry about it.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.238
So what do we do with this stuff?
Just shove it on up there?

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:05.076
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.621
They're gonna want to take this away.
You know that, right?

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:10.289
I know.

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:13.251
And then they're gonna
put me in in jail.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:16.504
Bring it over here!

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:19.215
Okay, take the door!

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.425
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:24.011
On three, two, one.

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:32.687
Hand over the jizz
and get on the ground.

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:36.232
C'mon man.
I really need this stuff.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.316
Get down now!

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:39.026
Tommy.

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:46.576
Look at my dick!
Look at my penis!

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.535
What the...

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:56.168
Operation Desert Sperm!

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.299
Where's the sperm?

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:03.009
I don't know.

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:05.928
- Did you get it?
- No, I missed it!

01:27:06.013 --> 01:27:07.513
- What?
- Let's go!

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:11.017
Hands behind your back.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.563
I'll meet you back
at the station, okay?

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:17.481
Okay.

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:19.817
- Hey.
- What?

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.069
You're always with me.

01:27:24.907 --> 01:27:26.616
All right. Let's go!

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:40.212
- Breathe!
- Okay.

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:42.006
You're doing great!

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.050
- Okay, we're almost there.
- You're doing great!

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:45.718
One big push.

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.386
We're almost there.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.226
- You got the clamp?
- Yes.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.899
He's beautiful.

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:06.447
- My little baby.
- Very nice. Very beautiful. Very beautiful.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:08.282
Hello, little fellow.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:12.203
Hello.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.664
Yeah?

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.750
What?

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:20.211
Okay, yeah, yeah.
No, no, I'll tell the guys.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.921
No, no, I'll tell the guys.

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.216
Okay. Be good.
Talk to you soon.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.052
Everybody? Got some news.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.637
Ron Jon's a daddy!

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:45.987
Hey, Mama?
What's going on in here?

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.325
That is to the end
of breastfeeding.

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.743
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:54.745
You're pretty.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.623
And how's my little mookie?
How are you doing?

01:28:57.708 --> 01:29:00.876
He's beautiful and
wonderful and farty.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.712
Just like his Daddy!

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.589
Daddy's a little farty.
Daddy gets that way, too.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.675
And there's my two
other little munchkins.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.468
How are you kids
doing over there?

01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:11.345
Don't we make
beautiful babies together?

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.014
I need butt cream.

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:15.558
Okay, Mama's gonna
go get some butt cream.

01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:17.810
Hey, dude. Grab the triplets.
It's time.

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:20.438
He's gonna go for you.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.606
- He's ready.
- My little guy.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.442
Hey, little man!

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:25.776
There's my big guy!

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:26.861
Hi!

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:29.196
All right, here we go.

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:31.198
I got $12 on Emmett!

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:33.200
Okay, put him down.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:35.786
Sammy's my boy. He's about
to clean some clocks.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.913
That's him
in the yellow, right?

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:40.708
No, that's Annie in the yellow.
Is that Audrey's breastmilk?

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:42.376
Nothing but the best
for these horses.

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:45.171
All right, now.
It's the 15-yard dash.

01:29:45.255 --> 01:29:47.548
The first baby that gets
to the bottle wins.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:48.591
You in on this action?

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:49.925
Absolutely.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.177
C'mon. These babies are hot.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.386
Let's go, let's go!

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:53.763
What's going on here?

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:55.556
We're racing the babies.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:58.392
- I got fifty on...
- Annie?

01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:00.436
Yeah.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.897
Okay, let's make some money.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:06.525
