WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:07.341
"Faster
Than the Speed of Light"]

00:14.482 --> 00:17.685
The year was 1971.

00:17.685 --> 00:22.356
Hot pants and bell bottoms
were the latest trends.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.293
Simon and Garfunkel's
Bridge Over Troubled Water

00:25.293 --> 00:27.695
was album of the year.

00:27.695 --> 00:31.199
And a controversial new sitcom
called in All in the Family

00:31.199 --> 00:32.800
premiered in prime-time.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.106
Playboy had grown bigger
than ever before...

00:39.840 --> 00:43.444
... thanks to increasing
magazine sales

00:43.444 --> 00:46.247
and over 15 Playboy clubs
around the world.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.717
On top of the clubs,

00:49.717 --> 00:52.920
we'd also started opening
luxury vacation resorts.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.724
Mr. Hefner has spent
no less than $10 million

00:56.724 --> 00:59.427
in building a resort
that makes the Taj Mahal

00:59.427 --> 01:00.594
look like a Quonset hut.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.133
Okay, let's shoot.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.467
Action!

01:06.467 --> 01:07.801
We also expanded into

01:07.801 --> 01:09.603
even more side ventures,

01:09.603 --> 01:12.340
including a TV and film
production company.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.944
We produced an adaptation
of "Macbeth,"

01:16.944 --> 01:18.746
directed by Roman Polanski...

01:21.215 --> 01:22.716
... and the first movie

01:22.716 --> 01:25.719
from the British comedy
troupe, Monty Python.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.424
The Playboy brand
was recognized

01:30.424 --> 01:33.627
all over the world...

01:33.627 --> 01:36.697
and what had started
as just a magazine

01:36.697 --> 01:39.400
was now a multinational
entertainment corporation

01:39.400 --> 01:43.371
worth $200 million.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.340
Nike is a brand, but Reebok
is a shoe company.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.143
Virgin is a brand,
United is an airline.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.512
Playboy was a brand,

01:51.512 --> 01:54.114
and that means
that you can move

01:54.114 --> 01:55.516
from one category
to another,

01:55.516 --> 01:58.486
because you represent
not a single product

01:58.486 --> 02:00.120
but an attitude toward life.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.591
Our success made us
very attractive

02:03.591 --> 02:05.293
to Wall Street investors...

02:07.195 --> 02:10.698
... so that year I decided
to take the company public.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.702
Playboy goes public.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.638
Now you bring in a tremendous
amount of capital,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.907
which you can then reinvest,

02:19.907 --> 02:23.043
and it's a signal
of the kind of normalization

02:23.043 --> 02:25.713
of the pornography business.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.914
I mean, what's
more establishment

02:26.914 --> 02:27.848
than Wall Street?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.820
The influx of cash
was a huge boost,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.323
and it felt good to have
the world acknowledge Playboy

02:35.323 --> 02:38.025
as a legitimate business.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.729
But the magazine was still
facing one major challenge.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.438
Ongoing competition
from Penthouse.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.712
Since 1969,

02:58.712 --> 03:00.814
Penthouse had been
pushing the envelope

03:00.814 --> 03:03.784
with pictures that
made Playboy look tame.

03:08.356 --> 03:12.326
Over the past two years,
they kept getting raunchier,

03:12.326 --> 03:15.596
and their subscription
had grown by 600%,

03:15.596 --> 03:18.532
to 1.3 million per month.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.839
Playboy still had nearly
five times as many readers,

03:25.839 --> 03:27.841
but I knew that if we
were going to continue

03:27.841 --> 03:30.711
to stay ahead
of the competition,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.646
Playboy would have to show

03:32.646 --> 03:36.250
a lot more than
we ever had before.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.987
* Every little movement *

03:39.987 --> 03:44.224
* Every little thing
you do *

03:44.224 --> 03:46.860
* Is it slight of hand *

03:46.860 --> 03:52.132
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

03:52.132 --> 03:56.370
* Every little movement *

03:56.370 --> 03:59.607
* Every little movement **

04:11.819 --> 04:14.355
So what do you think
we should do?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.757
Honestly? Nothing.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.059
Do you honestly want to
publish pictures like that?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.228
No, I want to publish
better pictures.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.296
And I know we can.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.332
Respectfully,
we already do.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.367
Agreed.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.404
This has to do
with Playboy's brand.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.972
What do you want that
to be?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.507
The best!

04:33.507 --> 04:35.142
We have the best
photographers in the world

04:35.142 --> 04:36.777
begging to work with us.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.580
We didn't get where we are
by being complacent.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.049
There is so much more we can
explore, more we can do,

04:42.049 --> 04:44.985
without losing sight
of what Playboy is about.

04:47.321 --> 04:51.692
Playboy had shown a glimpse of
pubic hair earlier in the year,

04:51.692 --> 04:56.497
but until now, I'd been
hesitant to do it again.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.931
Hef always stayed away

04:57.931 --> 05:00.033
from showing
full frontal nudity,

05:00.033 --> 05:06.774
but Playboy was actually losing
subscribers over to Penthouse.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.443
So Hef was pushed
in the direction

05:09.443 --> 05:11.512
of upping the game.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.782
I knew we needed to publish
a full-frontal centerfold,

05:14.782 --> 05:17.751
but I wanted to do it
the Playboy way,

05:17.751 --> 05:20.821
with polish and sophistication.

05:20.821 --> 05:25.493
To pull it off, we'd need
to find the perfect model.

05:25.493 --> 05:29.096
Luckily, Victor Lownes knew
just the girl for the job.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.832
"Cody Cody"]

05:44.044 --> 05:49.683
She was a bunny working
at the London Playboy Club...

05:49.683 --> 05:52.319
named Marilyn Cole.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.456
Marilyn had
a fantastic figure.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.893
I sent snapshots
of her to Chicago

05:59.893 --> 06:03.431
and said they ought to test
this girl for Playmate material.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.736
I was quite surprised

06:08.736 --> 06:11.071
when Victor suggested
I should be a Playmate.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.580
Not having been a model,

06:19.580 --> 06:22.516
he was the one who
sort of discovered me,

06:22.516 --> 06:25.385
and then I was sent
to Chicago.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.929
Lownes was right.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.966
Marilyn was the perfect
centerfold.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.338
But her photo represented

06:45.338 --> 06:47.508
a whole new direction
forPlayboy.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.050
It's Miss January.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.121
I'm getting a lot
of push-back from spec.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.289
And art.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.191
Would you print it?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.726
Are you kidding me, Hef?

07:05.726 --> 07:08.295
We both know you've
already made up your mind.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.631
Yeah, maybe.

07:11.865 --> 07:16.504
"It's All a Roundabout"]

07:16.504 --> 07:20.240
In January of 1972,

07:20.240 --> 07:24.044
Marilyn Cole became our first
ever full frontal centerfold.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.116
The issue was our
biggest seller to date.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.454
I became the first
full-frontal nude.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.490
What a legacy, but anyway...

07:36.490 --> 07:39.326
I've often been asked,
how did it feel?

07:39.326 --> 07:44.097
And I always think, "Well,
the point that you disrobe,

07:44.097 --> 07:46.667
you become someone else."

07:48.368 --> 07:49.903
That's the only way
you do it.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.409
It did cause a sensation,
certainly here in Britain,

07:56.409 --> 07:58.078
because, "A,"
I was English,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.480
and, "B," it was tabloid press
at that time.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.452
When she showed them to her
mother, her mother said,

08:05.452 --> 08:07.120
"Your hair looks
very nice, dear."

08:07.120 --> 08:09.089
That was her mother's
only comment.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.230
From that point on,
there was no turning back.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.902
By the end of 1972,

08:21.902 --> 08:24.237
our circulation
exceeded seven million,

08:24.237 --> 08:29.276
the highest it had ever been,
so we had a lot to celebrate.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.363
Hey, Kretch?
This is my boyfriend, Ron.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.498
Hi.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.933
In those days,

08:52.933 --> 08:54.635
no one seemed happier
than my longtime friend

08:54.635 --> 08:57.504
and personal assistant,
Bobbie Arnstein.

08:57.504 --> 09:01.742
She had recently started dating
a man named Ron Scharf.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.476
I've seen your issue.
My favorite.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.012
Hey, this is Hef.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.581
Hugh Hefner, hi.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.682
Ron.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.883
Nice to meet you,
finally.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.151
You, too, I've heard
a lot about you.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.386
Okay, we're gonna
take a tour.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.288
Enjoy dinner!

09:15.288 --> 09:16.757
Come on.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.191
So this
is the great room...

09:24.564 --> 09:28.068
I wasn't crazy
about her new boyfriend,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.570
but I did like to see
Bobbie happy.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.082
For over a decade,
Bobbie had been my assistant,

09:42.082 --> 09:45.619
but she'd also become
one of my closest friends.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.992
She lived full-time
at the mansion,

09:51.992 --> 09:54.662
so she was always around
when I needed her.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.397
Bobbie became absolutely
indispensable to me.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.900
Not only because of
the role that she played,

09:59.900 --> 10:03.103
but also because of her own
particular abilities.

10:05.773 --> 10:09.576
She had a remarkable
sensitivity and sense of humor.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.345
And was uncommonly bright.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.817
Bobbie was also part
of my social life.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.621
Okay, don't forget,
on Thursday

10:21.621 --> 10:23.356
you've got a meeting
at the mayor's office.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.793
And then Friday,
board meeting at 2:00 p.m.,

10:25.793 --> 10:27.060
so you gotta
look sharp for that.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.462
I left your gray suit out.
It's been pressed.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.165
Any questions,
talk to Dick.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.769
I don't know how I'm going to
survive without you, Bobbie.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.404
You'll be fine.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.706
All right.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.840
Have a safe trip.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.212
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.747
Not touching that one.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.400
Did you pack
the suntan lotion?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.635
Hmm?

11:08.635 --> 11:09.937
I put it out
with everything else.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.905
Well, then I packed it,
okay?

11:11.905 --> 11:13.807
It's not here.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.347
Maybe you put it
in your bag?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.782
Hey, hey...

11:21.782 --> 11:24.617
Just... buy
another one, okay?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.686
Here, there's a place
on the corner.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.321
I'm sure
they'll have some.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.814
Hey, man,
how's it going?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.415
Yeah, good, come on in.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.449
Who's she?

11:56.449 --> 11:57.617
Bobbie?

11:57.617 --> 11:59.119
Don't worry,
she's cool.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.424
So how much you want?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.159
Let's do a half.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.065
Three, four...

12:30.217 --> 12:33.787
Hey, are you
a friend of Ron's?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.288
Uh, yeah.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.057
I'm Bobbie.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.894
Uh, you are?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.230
Nice meeting you.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.007
Bobbie thought she was
on an innocent vacation

12:54.007 --> 12:57.277
with her boyfriend.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.447
But what she didn't realize
was that she was about
to become

13:00.447 --> 13:02.182
entangled in a government
investigation.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.995
By the 1970s,
the hippie drugs of the '60s,

13:14.995 --> 13:17.397
like marijuana and LSD,

13:17.397 --> 13:19.699
had given way
to harder substances,

13:19.699 --> 13:22.235
like cocaine and heroin.

13:26.739 --> 13:31.744
President Nixon declared drugs
a crisis in American life.

13:31.744 --> 13:36.083
We must wage total war against
public enemy number one:

13:36.083 --> 13:39.186
the problem of dangerous drugs.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.888
To crack down on their use,

13:40.888 --> 13:44.091
Nixon created a new Drug
Enforcement Administration.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.397
The DEA was tasked
with bringing down anyone

13:50.397 --> 13:53.000
suspected of breaking
federal drug laws.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.410
What's this?

14:05.245 --> 14:08.448
That's Miami drug trafficker
George Matthews.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.617
We've been monitoring him
for a couple of years now.

14:10.617 --> 14:15.288
Finally nailed him, thanks
to this guy, Ronald Scharf.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.391
Small-time drug dealer
based here in Chicago.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.060
He bought half a pound
off Matthews

14:20.060 --> 14:22.629
and tried selling it
to one of my informants.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.032
Who's the girl?

14:25.032 --> 14:27.400
You know Playboy publisher
Hugh Hefner?

14:27.400 --> 14:31.438
Well, that is his personal
assistant, Bobbie Arnstein.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.748
When a photo of Bobbie
landed on the desk

14:41.748 --> 14:45.485
of Chicago prosecutor
James Thompson...

14:45.485 --> 14:48.188
he immediately
saw an opportunity

14:48.188 --> 14:50.490
to turn this small drug case

14:50.490 --> 14:53.593
into something that could
make his entire career.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.033
Jim Thompson had
political aspirations,

15:00.033 --> 15:04.537
and this was going to be
his singular success

15:04.537 --> 15:09.042
in nailing Hef for some kind
of drug conspiracy,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.211
which was totally false.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.988
While Thompson
opened his investigation...

15:24.691 --> 15:26.293
... I was spending
more and more time

15:26.293 --> 15:28.695
with my girlfriend,
Barbi Benton.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.730
We had been dating
for over four years

15:30.730 --> 15:33.933
and spending a lot of time
in Los Angeles.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.704
So much time, Barbie convinced
me it was time to buy a house,

15:37.704 --> 15:41.141
and she'd found
the perfect spot.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.277
I was looking for a house,

15:44.277 --> 15:50.117
and our driver mentioned
a gate on Sunset Boulevard

15:50.117 --> 15:52.952
that had a lock on it.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.088
So I hopped the fence,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.024
walked up the long driveway,

15:57.024 --> 16:01.328
and saw this beautiful house.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.933
So I called the people
to find out if they would

16:06.933 --> 16:09.269
consider selling their house.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.941
And, as luck would have it,

16:14.941 --> 16:17.044
they said that
they would consider.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.113
I got Hef to come out.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.149
He loved the grounds,

16:22.149 --> 16:24.017
he loved the house,

16:24.017 --> 16:27.654
and... he got it.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.723
"Nothing From Nothing"]

16:46.506 --> 16:48.975
The new house sat on 5.3 acres

16:48.975 --> 16:51.144
on the edge of Beverly Hills.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.117
And, in typical
Playboy fashion...

16:59.886 --> 17:01.454
... I quickly made it my own.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.759
I built a winding, outdoor pool

17:06.759 --> 17:09.696
with waterfalls
leading into a grotto...

17:13.333 --> 17:15.268
... with artifacts
and fossilized insects

17:15.268 --> 17:17.270
in the ceiling.

17:20.407 --> 17:24.211
I had the largest grove of
redwoods in southern
California.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.481
A game house...

17:30.383 --> 17:31.784
... a tennis court...

17:33.186 --> 17:34.687
... and a gym.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.592
Even a zoo.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.230
And an aviary.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.739
I went so far as to get
a year-round fireworks license

17:52.739 --> 17:54.574
from the city.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.377
We're still the only private
residence ever granted one.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.083
I named the house
The Playboy Mansion West.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.657
And I split my time between
L.A.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.126
and the original mansion
back in Chicago.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.333
How's-- how's Monday
at 3:00 p.m.?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.734
We'll make whatever time work.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.935
-Okay.
-Done.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.637
-Between 3:00 and 4:00.
-Yep.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.773
I'll get it.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.482
DEA.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.650
We're looking
for Bobbie Arnstein.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.555
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.356
For what?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.258
Conspiracy to distribute.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.026
Distribute what?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.328
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.929
-What?
-Anything you say can and...

18:49.929 --> 18:51.164
Are you kidding me right now?
This is happening?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.466
... in a court of law.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.203
On March 23rd of 1974,

18:56.203 --> 18:59.206
almost three years
after Ron took her to Miami,

18:59.206 --> 19:02.542
Bobbie was arrested on charges
of cocaine distribution.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.681
Over the years,
Playboy had been charged

19:08.681 --> 19:11.284
with obscenity
and indecency...

19:12.885 --> 19:14.621
... but now,
Thompson made the case

19:14.621 --> 19:17.257
that the Playboy mansions
in Chicago and LA

19:17.257 --> 19:19.125
and clubs around the world

19:19.125 --> 19:22.562
were fronts for a major
drug trafficking operation.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.401
Bobbie had never been
his real target.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.773
She was just his way
of coming after me.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.979
Miss Arnstein,
I don't want to see you

19:39.979 --> 19:43.350
spend the rest
of your life

19:43.350 --> 19:46.386
rotting away
in some prison cell.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.758
What I do want is to see

19:51.758 --> 19:54.594
the right person
put behind bars.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.867
And you and I both know
who that person is.

20:02.635 --> 20:06.138
This drug ring you think
Playboy's involved in,

20:06.138 --> 20:07.774
it doesn't exist.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.211
I can offer you
federal protection.

20:14.481 --> 20:21.053
What do you think?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.556
I think you can both
go fuck yourselves.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.628
The case against Bobbie Arnstein

20:28.628 --> 20:31.097
was trumped up
as soon as they realized

20:31.097 --> 20:32.632
they had
Hefner's secretary.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.401
There's no question
in my mind

20:34.401 --> 20:36.235
that Bobbie did not
carry the cocaine,

20:36.235 --> 20:38.204
she did not transport it.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.039
The boyfriend did.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.074
It was his deal.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.311
They put it on her.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.746
And... that was
a terrible thing.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.519
For a long time
it was just, you know,

20:52.519 --> 20:54.186
an investigation
that was focused

20:54.186 --> 20:56.022
on this fellow
that she'd been dating.

20:56.022 --> 21:01.961
And, when the focused changed,
when it became clear that

21:01.961 --> 21:08.768
the real target was some crazy
attempt to involve me,

21:08.768 --> 21:13.005
it took on
Kafka-like implications.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.615
So, I was able to get a hold
of the original indictment.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.351
Bobbie's name's
not on it.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.585
Which means?

21:25.585 --> 21:26.719
Which means they
probably added it

21:26.719 --> 21:29.656
only after they realized
who she was.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.592
In other words, when they
realized she worked for Playboy.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.926
Make a copy of this
for Kretchmer.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.462
Tell him we're running it
in next month's issue

21:35.462 --> 21:37.063
along with an editorial
I'll write myself.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.765
-We'll get it done.
-That's out of the question.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.433
-Is it against the law?
-No.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.868
-Will it jeopardize our case?
-No.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.970
-Then we're running it!
-It's Bobbie's case.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.139
It's Bobbie who's on trial here,
not you and not Playboy.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.141
So you're just going to
let her hang out to dry?

21:49.141 --> 21:51.043
No, of course not.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.613
But what we're dealing with here
has very serious implications,

21:53.613 --> 21:56.048
not just for you and for
Bobbie, but for the company.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.784
The company will be fine.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.151
We already have
two board members

21:59.151 --> 22:00.587
resign because
of this.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.789
I have advertisers
backing out.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.291
Our stock price is down,
big time.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.561
All we gotta focus on is doing
some serious damage control.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.633
You need to separate
yourself from Bobbie.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.703
Not just for your sake,
but for hers.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.627
Bobbie was my best friend.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.729
But on the advice
of my lawyers,

22:42.729 --> 22:46.065
I was told not to speak
publicly about her case.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.836
And even worse,

22:49.836 --> 22:53.440
I had to ask her to move out
of the Chicago mansion.

22:55.174 --> 22:58.210
It killed me to know there was
nothing I could do to help her.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.913
It became very unreal.

23:00.913 --> 23:05.652
I knew that the DEA had become
a very corrupt organization

23:05.652 --> 23:08.821
and the case
was politically inspired.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.059
For most people,

23:13.059 --> 23:15.061
this is the image
of Bobbie Arnstein,

23:15.061 --> 23:17.564
assistant to Playboy publisher
Hugh Hefner.

23:17.564 --> 23:21.534
A girl who lived in what seemed
a sleek and fashionable world,

23:21.534 --> 23:22.869
a girl who somehow
became involved

23:22.869 --> 23:25.404
in the cruel
and shoddy drug world.

23:28.708 --> 23:32.979
On October 22, 1974,

23:32.979 --> 23:35.147
Bobbie's case went to trial.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.888
Your Honor,

23:41.888 --> 23:43.856
the defendants
in this case,

23:43.856 --> 23:46.859
Ronald Scharf
and Bobbie Arnstein,

23:46.859 --> 23:49.128
are charged
with a conspiracy.

23:49.128 --> 23:53.099
They conspired to distribute
a narcotic drug,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.767
specifically cocaine,

23:54.767 --> 23:57.604
and that these defendants
entered into an agreement

23:57.604 --> 24:00.306
with each other,
and with other persons,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.642
to distribute cocaine
in the United States.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.811
I don't think
any of us felt

24:04.811 --> 24:07.747
that they would
stoop this low,

24:07.747 --> 24:11.383
to threaten this young woman
with incarceration

24:11.383 --> 24:16.723
if she did not come forward
and lie about her boss.

24:16.723 --> 24:20.560
They would go just so far
and then back off.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.962
But they didn't do that.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.500
The prosecution was asking
for the maximum sentence:

24:27.500 --> 24:29.836
15 years in prison.

24:29.836 --> 24:33.339
I'm here to represent
my client, Bobbie Arnstein.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.209
She traveled from Chicago
down to Florida with Mr. Scharf,

24:37.209 --> 24:40.046
but we believe the evidence
will show that Miss Arnstein

24:40.046 --> 24:41.881
had no knowledge
or participation

24:41.881 --> 24:44.917
in any sale of drugs
while she was down in Florida

24:44.917 --> 24:47.554
and that she should
be found not guilty.

24:49.589 --> 24:54.060
The prosecution had gone so far
as to tap Ron Scharf's phone

24:54.060 --> 24:56.462
and presented transcripts
of his conversations

24:56.462 --> 24:58.565
with Bobbie in court,

24:58.565 --> 25:01.634
but none of the evidence
made it clear that Bobbie

25:01.634 --> 25:04.837
was knowingly involved.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.338
How's it going?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.640
How's Bobbie?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.875
You know, it's a...

25:08.875 --> 25:10.376
it's a trial.
It's tough for her.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.478
But she's, um,

25:12.478 --> 25:14.981
she's holding up
pretty well.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.083
Just let her know
I'm thinking about her.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.084
Of course.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.553
All right, bye.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.534
On behalf of the government,

25:35.534 --> 25:37.704
I would like to call
as a witness

25:37.704 --> 25:40.740
George E. Matthews
to the stand.

25:52.852 --> 25:56.088
I laid out some coke
on the coffee table.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.224
Scharf and I tested it,
and he asked to buy

25:58.224 --> 26:01.260
a half pound of the coke,
which I sold to him

26:01.260 --> 26:03.730
in a bag which I placed
on the coffee table.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.666
Was anyone else
present at this meeting?

26:06.666 --> 26:09.636
Yes.
Bobbie Arnstein.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.905
Did they leave with
the half a pound of cocaine

26:12.905 --> 26:14.506
you had left on the bed?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.143
Yes.

26:17.143 --> 26:21.981
Was Mr. Scharf carrying
the half a pound of cocaine?

26:21.981 --> 26:25.051
Bobbie Arnstein placed
the half pound of cocaine

26:25.051 --> 26:29.121
in her handbag
and carried it out.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.490
Thank you,
Mr. Matthews.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.893
No further questions.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.729
All right, Mr. Matthews.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.065
Now, you have before you

26:39.065 --> 26:41.267
the statement
you made previously.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.835
Now, in this statement
you made,

26:42.835 --> 26:44.036
is there anything
said by you

26:44.036 --> 26:46.538
stating Miss Arnstein's
presence

26:46.538 --> 26:49.341
when Scharf asked to buy
a half a pound of cocaine?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.477
Not in what
I have here, no.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.780
Is there any statement
made by you that Miss Arnstein

26:53.780 --> 26:55.481
put the cocaine in her bag?

26:55.481 --> 26:57.583
No.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.351
-Or carried the bag out?
-No.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.121
Subsequent to giving
these statements,

27:02.121 --> 27:03.723
did you have
any conversations

27:03.723 --> 27:06.993
with any government agent
about this case?

27:06.993 --> 27:10.196
I had a couple telephone
conversations, yes.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.732
What was the result
of these conversations?

27:12.732 --> 27:17.069
I... agreed to cooperate
with the government fully.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.872
Do you have an understanding
as to anything that you were

27:19.872 --> 27:23.542
to receive in return
for this cooperation?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.277
Yes.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.579
Would you tell the court
and jury, please,

27:27.579 --> 27:29.381
what your understanding
was?

27:29.381 --> 27:30.883
Uh, a recommendation

27:30.883 --> 27:34.053
that I be sentenced
to no more than five years.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.057
I have no further
questions.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.862
Bobbie's lawyers
had done all they could

27:42.862 --> 27:45.097
to prove her innocence.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.167
Now, her fate
was up to the jury.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.336
From a justice point of view,

27:50.336 --> 27:51.771
we felt
there was no question

27:51.771 --> 27:53.339
that she would be
found innocent.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.375
But with the threats
that she was getting

27:56.375 --> 28:01.680
from the U.S. attorney
and the DEA,

28:01.680 --> 28:05.918
one wasn't completely sure
what the outcome might be.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.256
Will the defendants
please rise?

28:13.359 --> 28:17.096
On the charge of conspiracy
to distribute a narcotic drug,

28:17.096 --> 28:20.199
the court finds
the defendants...

28:20.199 --> 28:21.267
guilty.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.439
The defendant,
Bobbie Arnstein,

28:27.439 --> 28:30.209
is committed to the custody
of the attorney general

28:30.209 --> 28:32.511
or his authorized
representative.

28:32.511 --> 28:38.250
The judge issued a preliminary
sentence of the full 15 years.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.652
Bobbie's boyfriend,
Ron Scharf,

28:40.652 --> 28:43.489
only got a six-year sentence.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.024
Court is adjourned.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.529
When they convicted her,
it was unreal.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.464
I knew she was innocent.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.300
They knew
she was innocent.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.771
They let major
drug dealers walk away,

28:58.771 --> 29:01.573
use them to convict her,

29:01.573 --> 29:05.211
all in an attempt
to somehow

29:05.211 --> 29:06.779
put enough pressure
on this girl

29:06.779 --> 29:11.283
so that she would invent
some story about me.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.519
I don't think you ought
to give any statement at all.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.054
Well, I think it's absurd.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.056
I don't think you ought
to give any statement.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.892
My lawyers suggest that
I not give any statements.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.828
It's not
my personal feeling.

29:21.828 --> 29:22.829
Okay, thank you.

29:22.829 --> 29:23.996
You're welcome, sorry.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.273
Hello?

31:59.085 --> 32:00.652
Ms. Arnstein,
executive assistant

32:00.652 --> 32:02.688
to Playboy publisher
Hugh Hefner,

32:02.688 --> 32:04.756
died of an overdose Monday.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.458
No bottles
containing prescriptions

32:06.458 --> 32:09.061
were found in the hotel room
where she took her life.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.797
Van Gordon Sauter
has a profile on the woman

32:11.797 --> 32:14.533
who died in a second-rate hotel.

32:18.737 --> 32:22.341
She was not doing what they
were saying she was doing.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.676
She was not carrying drugs,

32:24.676 --> 32:26.612
she was not dealing.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.982
She was just too tired
to keep fighting.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.684
... enmeshed by a boyfriend
in a drug raid

32:32.684 --> 32:35.387
and an aggressive
government investigation,

32:35.387 --> 32:38.890
the fragile entity that
was Bobbie Arnstein broke.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.693
Perhaps there is just
no more room in this world

32:41.693 --> 32:44.230
for such fragile people.

32:44.230 --> 32:49.301
Bobbie's suicide was devastating
for everybody who knew her,

32:49.301 --> 32:51.337
perhaps as much
as anything because

32:51.337 --> 32:55.241
it was completely unnecessary

32:55.241 --> 32:57.609
and was really
caused by the government

32:57.609 --> 33:01.380
pressuring her to give them
Hugh Hefner as a drug dealer.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.915
Rather than do anything
to hurt my father,

33:03.915 --> 33:06.785
she didn't see any way out
but to take her own life

33:06.785 --> 33:11.657
when faced with the threat
of significant prison time.

33:11.657 --> 33:16.995
I think just the tragedy of
that, was just heartbreaking.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.201
The funeral service,
from which cameras were barred,

33:22.201 --> 33:24.103
took nine minutes,

33:24.103 --> 33:25.937
the relatives
and old family friends

33:25.937 --> 33:29.208
pulling up to the funeral home
on Devon in five limousines,

33:29.208 --> 33:31.577
with a grim-looking
Hugh Hefner in the center.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.979
Bobbie Arnstein
had been swallowed up

33:33.979 --> 33:35.581
by all this in her life.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.084
It was happening
once again in her death.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.621
When Bobbie was laid to rest,

33:42.621 --> 33:46.958
her mother gave me the honor
of serving as a pallbearer.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.595
The seven pallbearers,
including Hefner,

33:49.595 --> 33:51.997
carried the steel coffin
from the funeral home

33:51.997 --> 33:53.599
and put it into a hearse.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.102
They all said goodbye
to Bobbie Arnstein today,

33:56.102 --> 33:58.470
all the worlds
in which she had lived.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.847
Throughout the entire
investigation,

34:08.847 --> 34:12.551
I followed my counsel's
advice and never said a word.

34:12.551 --> 34:17.223
Now I regretted that silence.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.057
Every time
I've allowed somebody

34:19.057 --> 34:20.426
to make me not
talk to the press,

34:20.426 --> 34:22.294
I've paid heavily for it.

34:22.294 --> 34:25.030
In this case, we all
paid heavily for it,

34:25.030 --> 34:28.367
and Bobbie paid for it
with her life.

34:28.367 --> 34:34.340
After she died, I said,
"I can't keep quiet anymore.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.342
I'm gonna make
a press statement."

34:41.747 --> 34:47.853
If I look a little harried,
I'm-- I'm quite upset.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.889
Okay.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.692
In the infamous witchcraft
trials of the middle ages,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.561
the inquisitors
tortured the victims

34:55.561 --> 34:58.130
until they not only
confessed to being witches,

34:58.130 --> 35:03.269
but accused their own families
and friends of sorcery as well.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.737
In similar fashion,
narcotics agents

35:05.737 --> 35:09.575
frequently use
our severe drug laws

35:09.575 --> 35:11.477
in an arbitrary
and capricious manner

35:11.477 --> 35:14.546
to elicit the desired
testimony for a trial.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.083
The pressure of a lengthy appeal
and increasing harassment

35:18.083 --> 35:20.886
from government prosecutors
and their agents...

35:23.689 --> 35:27.092
... an already
emotionally troubled woman...

35:27.092 --> 35:29.928
was pushed beyond endurance,

35:29.928 --> 35:31.630
and she killed herself.

35:35.734 --> 35:41.139
I was at the press conference
in the Chicago mansion.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.209
It was all true emotion.

35:46.645 --> 35:51.683
Hefner had been harmed beyond
belief, from his point of view.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.121
Nothing the government
could have done

35:56.121 --> 35:58.123
could have
hurt him more.

35:58.123 --> 36:02.761
She was one of the best,
brightest...

36:02.761 --> 36:05.597
most worthwhile women...

36:05.597 --> 36:07.333
I have ever known.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.171
She will be missed.

36:22.348 --> 36:26.318
Bobbie had been with me
for nearly 14 years.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.721
She'd kept things running,

36:29.721 --> 36:32.491
whether it was
my personal life,

36:32.491 --> 36:35.494
my business life,

36:35.494 --> 36:37.463
or even the mansion itself.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.899
She was one of the few people

36:40.899 --> 36:45.103
strong enough
to keep me in check.

36:45.103 --> 36:48.340
It was such a great
loss for Hef.

36:48.340 --> 36:52.344
He was devastated.

36:52.344 --> 36:57.316
It was the saddest
I'd ever seen him.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.688
What I think about
over and over again

37:02.688 --> 37:05.291
is all the years
and the good times

37:05.291 --> 37:07.859
and things
that she missed,

37:07.859 --> 37:11.263
and... the good times

37:11.263 --> 37:14.833
that would have
been better for us

37:14.833 --> 37:17.403
if she'd been here.

37:19.305 --> 37:26.177
With Bobbie gone, things
would never be the same.

37:26.177 --> 37:29.615
And everywhere I looked,
I only saw memories of her.

37:32.183 --> 37:36.087
So I decided the time
had come to say goodbye,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.690
not only to Bobbie,

37:38.690 --> 37:41.927
but to my entire life
in Chicago.
