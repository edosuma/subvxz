06:26.300 --> 06:27.800
Hello?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.000
Hello?

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
Come on! I know someone's in there!

08:46.500 --> 08:48.100
Hello?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.700
Hello?

10:32.300 --> 10:38.100
Hello? Is anybody out there?
Is anybody receiving me?

15:21.500 --> 15:23.000
Complete.

15:45.300 --> 15:50.000
Warning: Radiation danger.
The lab will be sealed immediately.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.600
Warning: The lab is now sealed.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.400
There's nobody in administration!

16:13.500 --> 16:19.100
You did it this time, Perrin. International Cooperation, eh?

16:21.800 --> 16:25.200
Well, you got everybody, including yourself.

16:26.200 --> 16:30.600
Ultraviolet level now exceeding 100 milliwatts.
Don protective clothing.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.200
Even me.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.000
...from Tanko, Texas.

17:17.099 --> 17:19.400
Analysis of these programs by our own computer

17:19.400 --> 17:22.500
indicates that the programs being supplied are incomplete.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.599
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that the LinCo HQ

17:26.599 --> 17:29.100
are deliberately withholding
information.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.400
I am unable to continue

17:30.400 --> 17:34.900
blindly working on a project
of such phenomenal destructive potential.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.100
Accordingly, there is only
one course of action open to me.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.500
Zac Hobson, July 5th.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.600
One: There has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight

17:48.600 --> 17:50.700
with devastating results.

17:52.100 --> 17:57.300
Two: it seems I'm the only
person left on Earth.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.200
Three: Perrin has been incinerated at the grid control.
Four: ...

18:05.900 --> 18:07.300
I've been sealed in the lab

18:07.400 --> 18:10.100
so I've setup a gas device in the washroom hoping to

18:14.000 --> 18:18.500
Warning: Alternate fire extinguishers not operating.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.400
Name, address, phone number.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Hello. My name is Zac Hobson.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.300
If there's anybody out
there at all, could you

19:07.300 --> 19:11.600
please contact me at home.
2 Thurston Avenue, Grey Lynn.

19:11.700 --> 19:15.100
Or ring me on 396-121.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.900
Hello. My name is Zac Hobson.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.000
If there's anybody out
there at all, could you

19:23.100 --> 19:27.500
please contact me at home.
2 Thurston Avenue, Grey Lynn.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.600
Or ring me on 396-121.

19:59.600 --> 20:04.800
Attention, attention. Would all those alive
please step forward and show themselves.

20:06.200 --> 20:12.200
...will be regarded as a direct
contravention of regulation 366025,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.300
section 11 paragraph B.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.100
Please somebody come.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.000
Time I moved up in the world.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.800
12th of July. I have now been broadcasting this
message for 5 days without reply.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.300
Please ignore my previous address

21:48.400 --> 21:54.800
as I am now a resident at 5 Rosehill Gardens, Churtin Heights.

21:55.800 --> 22:01.300
Pop in for a visit, or phone 665-058.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.500
I'd be delighted to hear from you.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.300
Hello. This is Zac Hobson again.

22:06.400 --> 22:13.400
12th of July. I have now been broadcasting this
message for 5 days without reply.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.200
Please ignore my previous address

22:15.300 --> 22:21.800
as I am now a resident at 5 Rosehill Gardens, Churtin Heights.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.600
Pop in for a visit, or phone 66-

24:22.500 --> 24:26.100
Very flamboyant.
Pity nothing went down.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.400
Thought I'd give you a bit of a chance.

24:36.300 --> 24:40.500
Big mistake. Polish this game off in one break.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.000
Terrified.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.600
Can't win against that kind of luck.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.800
Skill.

27:01.900 --> 27:06.500
...should be shut down immediately.
- Well I don't think that's the right thing to do.

27:06.700 --> 27:09.300
I honestly and sincerely believe that.

27:09.300 --> 27:13.800
It is your country's duty, as part of the
free world, to pursue all avenues of

27:13.800 --> 27:17.300
technological research that contribute to our position.

27:17.300 --> 27:21.100
thus maintaining the balance of power
that exists in the world today.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.800
Now I cannot overemphasize this
point, because you can rest assured

27:24.900 --> 27:28.100
that - even as I speak - this
is what the other side is d-

27:31.600 --> 27:34.500
What are you gonna do?
Destroy us all?

27:36.200 --> 27:37.700
I'm taking over.

27:50.100 --> 27:53.500
Look, I haven't got time to talk
to you. I'm a very busy man.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.100
Besides, you've had your chance.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.400
I have dedicated all my scientific
knowledge and skill to projects

28:24.500 --> 28:27.900
which I knew could be
put to evil purposes.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.800
For the common good!

28:44.800 --> 28:48.300
How easy to believe
in the common good,

28:48.300 --> 28:51.400
when that belief is rewarded

28:51.600 --> 28:56.400
with status, wealth

28:56.700 --> 28:58.700
and power!

29:07.000 --> 29:09.300
How hard to believe
in the common good.

29:11.400 --> 29:16.500
When every fiber of my being tells me

29:16.900 --> 29:21.200
that the awesome forces
that I have helped to create

29:21.400 --> 29:25.200
have been put into the hands of madmen!

29:27.700 --> 29:31.700
I've been gay by the volume
of my own corruption!

29:32.900 --> 29:35.700
Is it not fitting, then, that I be president?

29:37.500 --> 29:38.700
Of this...

29:39.600 --> 29:43.400
...quiet Earth?

29:49.100 --> 29:50.800
I've been condemned to live.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.200
Where is he?

31:42.500 --> 31:46.200
Alright, where are you?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.500
Where are you?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.100
Where is he?

32:03.900 --> 32:07.200
If you don't come out, I'll shoot the kid!

32:42.000 --> 32:43.400
And now I am God.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.200
Hello.
- G'day.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.900
How are you?
- Pretty good. Whaddya know?

36:37.200 --> 36:41.400
UV's up a bit. Keep an eye on that.

37:07.300 --> 37:08.900
It's not real.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.500
God, it's good to see someone.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.000
So, I went into my sister's room...

37:33.300 --> 37:34.600
...and she was gone.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.800
I mean gone.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.000
Just...

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
...disappeared.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.400
I hung around for about two weeks after that.
I don't remember much.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.600
It was pretty bad.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.500
Guess you were a little crazy.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.100
I didn't decide I was president of the world.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.000
It was really strange walking through
the hospital in the dark.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.000
No sound. Empty beds.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.000
I was quite shocked when I saw the baby.
- Baby?

38:16.800 --> 38:18.500
Yeah, not just that it was a baby

38:20.300 --> 38:23.000
I didn't look too closely. There were maggots.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.100
That means there must be flies.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.300
No. The effect happened three weeks ago.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.100
The baby hadn't been dead that long.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.300
Something's changed.

38:38.500 --> 38:43.000
I can't quite measure it,
but I can feel it.

38:45.600 --> 38:50.000
It's as though we've been shifted sideways.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.100
North Pole's still up north,

38:52.100 --> 38:56.000
but the water keeps going down
 the plug hole the wrong way.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.300
I get the feeling...

39:01.500 --> 39:03.600
We're either dead...

39:04.600 --> 39:06.700
...or in a different universe.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.400
Are you in a different universe?
Are you a woman?

39:37.300 --> 39:39.000
...or a child?

39:55.300 --> 39:57.100
I've got this theory...

39:57.200 --> 40:00.400
I believe people's faces are soft, like plasticine.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.600
They're not rigid, like bone,
as doctors would have us believe.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.700
And the shape of the face is
determined consciously by the brain.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.600
So, if your brain has got a low capacity,

40:11.700 --> 40:14.600
you would be both ugly and stupid.

40:14.700 --> 40:16.300
But if you've got a reasonably good brain,

40:16.300 --> 40:18.400
then it's up to you to decide
how to use its energy.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.100
You could be reasonably attractive
and reasonably intelligent...

40:21.900 --> 40:25.400
...or you could be
smart, but ugly.

40:28.100 --> 40:30.300
Or beautiful, but stupid.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.400
I thought one didn't get a hangover with champagne.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.100
So did I.

40:41.700 --> 40:45.800
Now, if you got really lucky, you
could have an exceptional brain...

40:45.900 --> 40:48.700
...and you could be both extremely beautiful

40:48.800 --> 40:50.900
and highly intelligent.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.600
Like me.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.500
Did you make all that up yourself
- Yeah.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.400
You're beautiful.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.100
Hey...

41:03.200 --> 41:05.200
Are you calling me stupid?

41:05.300 --> 41:06.600
No, no.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.700
Wouldn't do that.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.500
No maggots.

41:51.700 --> 41:53.400
She was calling for help.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.300
She was definitely alive after The Effect.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.700
Pull over.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.800
What's wrong?

42:35.700 --> 42:37.700
Does it look to you like the sun's pulsating?

42:41.500 --> 42:42.400
No.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.300
No. Doesn't to me, either.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.200
Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

43:23.900 --> 43:27.200
This one's yours.
- Thanks very much.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.700
If we find anyone alive,
what do you think we'll be like?

43:33.400 --> 43:35.700
We might find all manner of horrors.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.600
Politicians.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.500
Transvestites.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.700
I think we should look in places where

43:48.800 --> 43:51.600
people are either trapped
or too afraid to leave.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.600
Mental hospitals, prisons.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.900
That sort of thing.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.000
Then let's hope we don't find anyone.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.200
We have to look.

44:11.300 --> 44:12.700
There you are.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.800
Run out of words?

44:34.200 --> 44:37.600
Where are we sleeping?
- I'm sleeping over there.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.800
Thought you might say that.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.700
This one'll do. Keys are in it.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.400
I still don't like it.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.800
Don't be beautiful.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.600
It's simple: I'll cover that side
of the river, you cover this.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.100
Call me every half hour.
- Yeah.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.600
Zac, can you hear me?

45:40.600 --> 45:41.800
Joanne, come in please.

45:42.500 --> 45:46.700
Zac, I'm at the hospital.
Where are you?

45:46.700 --> 45:49.200
I'm driving past the university.
Everything okay?

45:49.500 --> 45:51.400
Yes. I'm just going in.

45:51.900 --> 45:54.100
Okay. Call you in half an hour.

47:12.300 --> 47:14.300
You there, Zac?

47:15.500 --> 47:18.600
Hello. You okay?

47:19.200 --> 47:22.700
I felt really strange a few
seconds ago. Where are you?

47:24.200 --> 47:29.200
I'm at Mental Street and Hillcrest.
There's nothing here.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.600
Is there anything at the university?

47:34.100 --> 47:35.500
Not a thing.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.400
Call you later.
But, keep in touch, though.

47:38.700 --> 47:41.300
Okay. Over and out.

47:59.500 --> 48:00.800
Are you trying to tell me that you

48:00.800 --> 48:03.300
and your white-coated cronies up the road there

48:03.300 --> 48:05.900
really had something to do with this?

48:06.100 --> 48:07.200
Don't know.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.300
I was an American idea.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.400
They were experimenting
with energy transmissions

48:13.400 --> 48:15.200
through a grid surrounding the Earth.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.800
Aircraft, drawing directly from that grid,

48:18.800 --> 48:20.900
so they wouldn't have to refuel.

48:20.900 --> 48:21.700
That sort of thing.

48:22.100 --> 48:26.800
Of course. An exclusive all-male club

48:26.800 --> 48:28.800
playing God with the universe.

48:32.200 --> 48:36.900
We were just one small unit in a whole
network of stations around the world.

48:37.300 --> 48:40.800
Acting simultaneously. Besides...

48:43.100 --> 48:45.700
We might not have been responsible.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.000
God may have just blinked.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.000
God blinked and the
whole world disappeared?

48:52.700 --> 48:57.700
A world of noisy, brawling,

48:57.700 --> 49:00.000
wonderful human beings.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.600
God, I miss them.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.500
It's alright.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.500
Hello?

49:35.500 --> 49:37.200
Dr. Hobson, this is reception.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.600
I suppose you realize you must
vacate your room by 10 o'clock.

49:41.100 --> 49:44.200
And, are you aware there is an extra
charge for your guest last night?

49:44.300 --> 49:46.300
Didn't realize I had to pay for it.

49:48.600 --> 49:52.500
You don't get anything for nothing, you know?
- Come back to bed.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.500
Thank you.
- Anything else, sir?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.800
More crumpet?
- Sorry, love, crumpet's off.

50:23.200 --> 50:26.000
See you 1 o'clock in the plaza.
- Okay, then we head south.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.600
We go back.
- We'll discuss that at lunch.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.100
There are a number of constants

51:23.100 --> 51:25.900
which have never been known to
change in the history of science.

51:27.100 --> 51:29.700
One of these is the unit
charge of an electron.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.600
In an experiment I have just conducted

51:33.700 --> 51:36.600
I have established that
this charge has changed

51:36.900 --> 51:40.600
and, in fact, is oscillating
between two new values.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.300
I cannot to measure these values,

51:43.600 --> 51:47.700
as it seems the amplitude of
the oscillation is increasing.

51:51.800 --> 51:56.600
I can only conclude that
the fabric of the universe

51:56.500 --> 52:01.200
has not only altered,
but is highly unstable.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.700
God knows where that leaves us.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.400
Hello, mon cher.

52:12.100 --> 52:16.800
Joanne, is that you?
- You mean there is someone else?

52:17.400 --> 52:21.100
Hey, you know you're the only girl
in the world for me, sweetheart.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.600
Okay.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.500
Au revoir, cheri.
- I'm on me way.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.200
Freeze, mister!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.400
You alone?

54:33.500 --> 54:34.700
You seen anyone else?

54:37.100 --> 54:39.300
Up against the truck.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.000
Turn around.

55:03.900 --> 55:05.600
Zac, are you there?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.100
Zac?

55:20.600 --> 55:22.400
What's holding you up?

55:38.300 --> 55:42.000
You tell lies.
- No, well, what would you have done?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.900
How many of you?
- Just her and me.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.300
Two of yous?

55:51.600 --> 55:54.600
Switch it off and cruise.

56:15.600 --> 56:16.900
Look...
- Come on!

56:24.800 --> 56:27.000
She's not there.
- You'll find her.

56:50.300 --> 56:51.800
Zac, where've you been?

56:51.800 --> 56:55.400
Why didn't you answer me?
- This bloody radio.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.800
I thought I was gonna be alone again.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.500
Good.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.500
Hide the bottle. It's a cop.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.400
Straight face, please.

58:44.800 --> 58:49.300
Fish. Fish in that stream.
- Baby ones.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.800
Yeah, that makes sense. The fish
eggs settle on the river bed.

58:52.900 --> 58:55.300
The male fish swims along
dropping sperm on them.

58:55.300 --> 58:59.000
So, if the sperm was released before
The Effect, and penetrated after...

58:59.800 --> 59:02.100
...there's be fish.

59:04.100 --> 59:08.800
For awhile there, I thought I was dead.
- He thought he was God.

59:14.100 --> 59:17.400
Why did you think you were dead?
- Cause I was.

59:19.300 --> 59:24.200
I was in the bush down south with a mate.
Well, sort of mate.

59:38.700 --> 59:42.400
As I began to go unconscious,
I could see it all happening.

59:43.900 --> 59:46.400
I was watching from high up.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.700
I could see him, and I could see myself.

59:50.700 --> 59:53.600
It was really peaceful.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.700
Like a weight'd been lifted off.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.700
There was another thing.
Like a light a long way off.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.300
I was traveling towards it
Yearning to reach it.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.400
Suddenly, I felt the whole weight
of life crash back on me.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.100
I was so disappointed.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:23.000
You felt that, if you could reach that light,
you'd never want to come back again.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.100
Happened to me.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.700
The same.
- The moment of death.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.700
The effect happened at the exact moment
of death and that's why we survived.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.800
Is that what you think?
- I reckon.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:55.300
For awhile there I didn't know what I was.
And when I found I was alone in this world...

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.600
I thought I was a ghost.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.500
It was really sad.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.200
I reckoned if I was here and alive,
I'd better head north to look for survivors.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.900
And if I was a spirit, I thought
I'd better head for Cape Reinga.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.100
Either way, I was heading
in the right direction.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.700
So there's just the three of us.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.900
Well, you're alive and so am I.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.000
How about you?

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.100
I suppose so.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.900
What do you think of him?
- He plays the odd bum note.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.900
Oh, come on.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.700
Nah, I think he's great.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:10.100
See you made the beds.
- Mmhm. One...two.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.000
It's ironic.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.000
Of all of us, I thought I'd be the
one most equipped to handle

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.000
Whatever it is that's happened.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.900
I used to enjoy being a loner.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.300
And then you came along.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.500
I'm thinking about the three of us now.
Not just you and not just me.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.500
Hey Api, play us another
song which we can sing.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.000
Okay.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Let auld acquaintance be forgot,

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:04.400
and never brought to mind

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.200
Let auld acquaintance be forgot,

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.700
for the sake of auld lang syne

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.300
for the sake of auld lang syne

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.500
If the oscillations in the sun continue
to increase at the present rate

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.000
the sun must collapse in a few
days, taking everything with it.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.600
Computer analysis is needed immediately
for a more accurate prediction.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.100
You know, the interesting thing about
friendships is, is that they're not logical.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.400
You know how some people
will come up to you

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.400
and they'll ask you why
do you like so and so,

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400
and you'll give them all these
interesting reasons why you do,

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.700
but you've actually made them up
after you've decided you like them.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.900
I reckon you decide you like somebody

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.400
in the two seconds you meet them.
You stick to it regardless.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.900
So, if you like them, you're gonna find
good things in all the bad things they do.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And if you don't, you're gonna find bad
things in all the good things they do.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.700
The other thing is, you tend
to like people who like you.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.300
And what did you decide about me?

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.300
Guess you like me.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.700
Why was your mate trying
to kill you?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.900
Cause I killed his wife.
- Killed his wife? Why?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.800
It was necessary.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.700
Necessary.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.300
And who decides when
it'll be necessary?

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.900
And when'll be the next time
that you decide it's necessary?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.400
Who the hell do you
think you are? God?

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.500
You're not God.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.300
Joanne, look, something
really strange is happening.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.400
I don't quite understand
it, but we're gonna...

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.500
What's the matter?
- Leave me alone, please.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.700
What's happened?

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.800
Look, I got something
really important to tell ya.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.000
We went through all
that shit last night.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.500
I'm not talking about last night,
I'm talking about the sun!

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:03.100
You wanna talk about the sun?
Go and talk to that God out there.

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.400
Listen to me!

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.800
Take your hands off me.
- What are you doing?

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:18.800
Api...

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.300
How soon can you get your gear
together? We've gotta head up north.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.399
But you just got here?

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.600
Yeah, I know. But please,
mate, how quickly?

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.300
My place not good enough for you?
- No, no. It's not that.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:35.700
Look, I'll explain it along the way, okay?
- Are you in charge here?

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.399
Okay. Yeah, if that's the way
you want it, yes I am. Yes.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.700
She came back crying.
What did you do to her?

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.399
What will you do?
- I'm in charge, remember?

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.100
Joanne, get your ass into gear.
We're leaving straight away.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.899
Listen, honky, haven't you noticed?
Things have changed around here.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.899
The white boss went with the rest of
them. There's just you and me now.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.800
Look, it's complicated enough
for people like me

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.800
without trying to explain
to people like you.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.899
People like what?
- Will you listen to that!

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.700
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.899
You coming?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.700
I wouldn't ride with you if
you were the last man on Earth.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.300
I'm working on it.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.700
It would seem that Domingo's
Operation Flashlight is still intact.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.900
Self-energizing from the
entire balanced grid.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.100
And this is somehow
affecting the Sun.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.600
You!

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.900
If you don't stop, I'll shoot.
And I don't care which one.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.400
I'm not going to live with two
of you at each other's throats

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.500
trying to prove which one is God.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.100
If you don't believe me, try it.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.100
You don't trust -

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.300
For Christ's sake!

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.500
Look, that bloody thing's been
worrying me for over a year now.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.200
I knew there was something
wrong with that project.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.200
And I said nothing.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.600
Can you be more guilty than that?

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.800
You condemned yourself to death.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.800
On the morning of The Effect,
you were trying to kill yourself.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.800
What you gonna do about it?
- Don't know.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.700
You trying to tell me you
jokers caused all this

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.000
and you can't even fix it?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.300
Well, we never did know the full story.
The Americans withheld information.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.600
Are you monkeying
with the universe

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.700
without even knowing
what you're doing?

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.100
Nobody realized what
was happening.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.900
We trusted them.
They were on our side.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.500
You can't be that dumb.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.100
They might as well tell the
Russians as tell you jokers.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.200
Besides: They don't tell you,
you don't tell us...

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.700
You're all the same to me.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.600
Well, I've told you now.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.600
You tell lies.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.100
Try it again.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.300
Same result.
- Those two lines that meet.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.400
What do they mean?

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.500
It's a time scale. That's the
point of maximum instability.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.400
About 6 o'clock tomorrow morning.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.100
What happens then?

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:47.100
Well, I think it's The Effect.
It's gonna happen again.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.200
Zac?

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.800
Joanne?

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.000
Api?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.600
Hey!

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.500
Yeah?

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.600
Zac?

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:09.700
Api?

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.000
Where are you?

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.400
Api!

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.000
Zac?

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.900
Api.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.800
Joanne? Where are you?

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.200
Joanne!
- I 'm here.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.400
You okay?

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.700
Your calculations are wrong.
It's too soon.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.500
No. That was just a tremor.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.000
Next time that happens,
it'll be the real thing.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400
Your calculations are
a waste of time.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.300
You reckon the grid is ballast?

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.500
Okay. We take the sand out,
the grid collapses.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.400
Didn't work.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.500
Neat, eh?
- He's an artist.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.600
Are you sure there's enough?

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.400
How much you reckon we need?

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.300
A ton?

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.900
We take a truckload.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:03.400
So, Perrin throws the switch, The Effect
happens, and everyone disappears.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.800
But our little effect is happening
again tomorrow morning.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.000
Now there's no Perrin, no switch.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.400
So maybe The Effect and the
grid are totally unrelated.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.800
You mean like that boy with the stick?
- Ay?

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.300
The boy with the stick.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.100
Remember that massive power
blackout in the States?

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:27.900
The whole east coast was
out for about 6 hours.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.600
They reckon this boy
was on his way home.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.600
He was pissed off
about something.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.400
And he whacked this power
pole with all of his might.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.500
And, at that instant,
his whole world went black.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.400
And he thought he had done it.
What do you reckon?

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:47.100
Well, I reckon The Effect was a
cosmic event, like the creation.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.800
And nobody has ever
explained that properly.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.400
On the other hand, perhaps
nobody disappeared. Only me.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.600
I am The Effect.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.600
And us?
- You're not real. You're in my mind.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.800
You're God.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.300
I actually do think it's the grid.
Besides, it's our best bet.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.500
So I'll get the other truck.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.600
We're not real.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.300
You were born under the
shadow of Pirongia.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Down that way...

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.400
Patupaiarehe. The red-haired
people of the night.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.300
Maybe you're not real.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.700
Real enough.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.800
Oh well. I suppose, if this works,
we all live happily ever after.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.700
Don't we?
- Hopefully.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.200
All three of us?
- We have to.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.000
It's easier for me because
I like both of you.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.700
But you do prefer him...

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.200
I get a really strange
notion sometimes.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.000
Sometimes I feel
as if you and Api

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.100
have known each other
a long, long time.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.300
As though I'm the victim
of some huge conspiracy.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.900
And you and Api have been
sent to be my guardians.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.200
I feel as though you
pass secret messages

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.100
when I'm not looking.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.900
Perhaps we do.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
There's some pretty
odd things about Api.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.300
Are you worried about why his
mate was trying to kill him?

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.100
Yeah.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.800
He killed his mate's wife.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.000
She was in love with him
and he rejected her.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.600
So she committed suicide.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:14.900
And he felt he was responsible.
So did his mate.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.900
That's really sad.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.500
The things I've learned
about people...

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.300
...in the last few weeks.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.100
You needn't worry about me.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.400
Whatever happens,
I can handle it.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.600
Look out!

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:49.400
Api! I knew there was something
I forgot to tell him.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.800
What do you reckon?
- Blow it up?

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.300
I'll push it out of the way.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.200
Hey, Api?

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.000
Be careful.
- No sweat.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.700
He's going an awfully
long way back.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.700
Surely he's not...
- No.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.200
He is!

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.300
Anybody coming?
- See ya.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.400
Api. You read me?

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.300
Api. Come it, Api.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:45.100
Here comes the boss.
- Answer your bloody radio, Api!

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.900
Give him a bit of a squeeze, eh?
- What the hell are you doing?

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.300
We can't go any closer.
- Why?

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.400
The lab's so hot with ionization,

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.500
it'd be like walking
into a microwave oven.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.200
Are we safe enough here?

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:31.700
It's about a mile away.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.400
Looks like we didn't bring enough.
- Shall we take a look?

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.200
The lights are still on.
- Yeah.
Are supplied by the network.

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.100
We'll know whether the grid's
collapsed. The lights will go out.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.700
If we ever get the
truck in there at all.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.800
Who's gonna take it in?

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.800
I got something back in the
city that could do this job.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.700
It's a radio control unit. I've
used it on a lawn mower.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.700
Will it work on a truck that size?

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.700
We can adapt it.
- Have we got time?

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.200
Think so.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.900
If I leave now, I'll be
back in two hours.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.600
Like me to come with you?

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.300
Best you stay.
- Okay.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.900
What do you think will happen?

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.700
He will try with
the radio device.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.300
Probably won't work
on a truck that size.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.300
So I'll drive it in.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.200
Why you?
- Cause I'm the driver.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.700
Anyway, it is easier for me.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:49.300
My old kuia's looking after me.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.500
What's that?
- It's the truck!

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.800
How long's it been?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.200
About 20 minutes.
- He can't have gone at all.

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.500
He tells lies!

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.600
It's started.
- Zac?

01:27:27.305 --> 01:27:33.479
