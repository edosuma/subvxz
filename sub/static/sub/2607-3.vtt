(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:16.161 --> 01:20.957
MAN 1: <i>Coming back in five, four...</i>
MAN 2: <i>Copy. 0036 to 41.</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:25.336
WILL: <i>Presidential candidate Michele</i>
<i>Bachmann thinks our troops are the best.</i>

01:25.420 --> 01:29.340
BACHMANN: <i>They are the best.</i>
<i>This is the easiest thing to get behind.</i>

01:29.424 --> 01:32.177
<i>It doesn't get any better to help our troops</i>

01:32.343 --> 01:36.181
<i>when they are literally</i>
<i>on the lines fighting for our freedom.</i>

01:36.264 --> 01:38.433
Presidential candidate Herman Cain

01:38.516 --> 01:43.438
will not apologize for having the biggest,
baddest, greatest military on the planet.

01:43.521 --> 01:49.778
<i>And I don't apologize for having the biggest,</i>
<i>baddest, greatest military on the planet.</i>

01:49.861 --> 01:52.781
<i>- Presidential candidate Mitt Romney...</i>
- 44B.

01:52.864 --> 01:54.115
<i>...would like the rest of us</i>
<i>to support the troops</i>

01:54.199 --> 01:56.159
<i>- even more than we already do.</i>
- Copy.

01:56.242 --> 02:00.413
<i>I think it's time for American citizens</i>
<i>and politicians to show a surge of support</i>

02:00.497 --> 02:04.751
<i>and for us to reach out to our neighbors</i>
<i>who are serving in the military.</i>

02:04.834 --> 02:07.170
And presidential candidate Rick Santorum

02:07.253 --> 02:12.801
marvels, as we all do, at the selfless act
of volunteering to serve in a time of war.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.262
SANTORUM: <i>We have a culture right now</i>
<i>that doesn't say, "Serve."</i>

02:16.346 --> 02:20.308
<i>It doesn't say, "Don't think about yourself."</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.101
<i>It says, "Me, me, me."</i>

02:22.185 --> 02:27.524
<i>It's a very self-absorbed, me-centered,</i>
<i>excessive popular culture.</i>

02:27.607 --> 02:30.902
<i>And yet, we have brave men and women</i>
<i>who are willing to step forward</i>

02:30.985 --> 02:32.862
<i>because they know what's at stake.</i>

02:32.946 --> 02:38.368
<i>They're willing to sacrifice their lives</i>
<i>for this great country.</i>

02:38.451 --> 02:41.955
Stephen Hill is a decorated
captain in the US Army,

02:42.038 --> 02:44.624
where he's been a reservist for 20 years.

02:44.707 --> 02:49.504
He is, this very night,
serving in combat in Iraq, as he was last night

02:49.587 --> 02:53.424
when he asked this question via YouTube
at the GOP debate in Orlando, Florida.

02:54.551 --> 02:57.929
<i>In 2010, when I was deployed to Iraq,</i>
<i>I had to lie about who I was</i>

02:58.012 --> 03:01.015
<i>because I'm a gay soldier</i>
<i>and I didn't want to lose my job.</i>

03:01.099 --> 03:04.894
<i>My question is,</i>
<i>under one of your presidencies,</i>

03:04.978 --> 03:07.939
<i>do you intend to circumvent</i>
<i>the progress that's been made</i>

03:08.022 --> 03:10.149
<i>for gay and lesbian soldiers in the military?</i>

03:10.817 --> 03:13.111
(AUDIENCE MEMBERS BOOING)

03:14.362 --> 03:16.865
That was a big room
full of Republican primary voters

03:16.948 --> 03:21.536
booing an American combat soldier
who, as he was speaking, was in combat.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.789
The audience members who were booing
were in Orlando.

03:24.873 --> 03:28.042
Soon, they'll surely be in hell,
though not soon enough.

03:28.126 --> 03:30.879
Not everyone was booing.
There were people in the audience

03:30.962 --> 03:34.215
who heard Captain Hill say that
when he was deployed to Iraq,

03:34.299 --> 03:38.219
he was worried that if his sexuality
was discovered, they might not let him go,

03:38.303 --> 03:42.140
as opposed to most of us, who,
if told we were being deployed to Iraq,

03:42.223 --> 03:45.894
would go Corporal Klinger faster than
you can pull on a yellow taffeta picnic dress.

03:46.561 --> 03:50.565
<i>I'm sure there were even some people</i>
<i>in the building who stood up for Captain Hill,</i>

03:50.648 --> 03:52.650
<i>people who had</i>
<i>the simple strength of character</i>

03:52.734 --> 03:55.737
to turn to the fraction of a human
in the seat next to them and say,

03:55.820 --> 03:58.448
"How many different kinds of disgusting
do you have to be

03:58.531 --> 04:01.659
"to boo a man
who volunteered to fight and die for you?"

04:03.369 --> 04:06.247
<i>I'm sure those people were there.</i>
<i>I'm sure there were many of them.</i>

04:06.331 --> 04:09.709
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>none of them were on the stage.</i>

04:09.792 --> 04:12.253
Not one of these
would-be commanders in chief

04:12.337 --> 04:15.381
took a moment to stand with a line officer.

04:15.465 --> 04:17.258
<i>They let him stand alone.</i>

04:17.342 --> 04:21.512
Soldiers never do that. Leaders never do that.

04:21.596 --> 04:25.808
Witless bullies and hapless punks
do it all the time.

04:25.892 --> 04:29.854
<i>The only president on the stage last night</i>
<i>was Stephen Hill.</i>

04:29.938 --> 04:32.482
Godspeed, Captain Hill,
and come home soon.

04:32.565 --> 04:36.069
A grateful nation is waiting to say thank you.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.946
<i>That's</i> News Night <i>for September 23rd.</i>

04:38.029 --> 04:40.114
<i>Terry Smith is up next with</i>
The Capitol Report.

04:40.198 --> 04:42.325
<i>I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.</i>

04:44.535 --> 04:45.787
When you turn to the monitor,

04:45.870 --> 04:48.206
I need you to slide your chair back
about an inch for the key light.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.290
Why?

04:49.374 --> 04:51.793
So the photons bounce off your face
and not your forehead.

04:51.876 --> 04:52.877
I don't get it.

04:52.961 --> 04:55.713
You have to slide your chair back
about an inch when you turn to the monitor

04:55.797 --> 04:57.799
- so we can see your face.
- Is this a new problem?

04:57.882 --> 04:58.883
- Yeah.
- Why?

04:58.967 --> 05:00.301
I guess you used to slide your chair back.

05:00.385 --> 05:01.678
Why don't you adjust the key light?

05:01.761 --> 05:04.430
Because when you're not facing the monitor,
you're... Never mind.

05:04.514 --> 05:07.934
Number two, don't stare at guests
who are wearing toupees.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.394
- I know. I couldn't help it.
- Help it.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.939
- I was mesmerized, and a little bored.
- Okay.

05:13.022 --> 05:16.067
Did I take you by surprise
with the "witless bullies and hapless punks"?

05:16.150 --> 05:17.694
No, you left a message for me last night.

05:17.777 --> 05:21.072
I realized as I was saying it that
you never mentioned you got the message.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.533
- I did, and I approved.
- I wasn't asking for your approval.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.535
- You were, but speaking of voice mail...
- No.

05:25.618 --> 05:26.744
- Come on.
- Let it go.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.204
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.664
You've asked me every day for two months.

05:29.747 --> 05:32.041
- There have been days when I haven't asked.
- You asked on Sundays.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.501
Sundays are your holy day?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.336
I don't remember the message.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.588
You said,
"I'm not just saying this because I'm high."

05:37.672 --> 05:38.673
And then?

05:38.756 --> 05:41.634
- I left the message in May.
- "I'm not just saying this because I'm high..."

05:41.718 --> 05:44.470
- I don't remember.
- How can you not remember?

05:44.554 --> 05:45.847
- Really?
- Right, you were high.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.015
Yeah.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.769
- Still...
- All right.

05:51.853 --> 05:54.689
"Witless bullies and hapless punks."

05:54.772 --> 05:56.232
- Too far?
- Not far enough.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.861
You should have told what's-her-name
to go fuck herself, too. The moderator.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.863
I'm not allowed to
make that suggestion on television.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.115
Make it anytime you want. We're protected.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.035
- You mean the tape.
- The tape, baby, the tape.

06:07.118 --> 06:11.706
We're like made men.
We're like Joe Pesci in <i>Goodfellas.</i>

06:11.789 --> 06:14.250
- He got shot.
- Before he got shot.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.711
Before he got shot, he wasn't a made man.

06:16.794 --> 06:20.173
- We're like James Caan in <i>The Godfather.</i>
- Also shot. Many, many times.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.215
Who are we like?

06:21.299 --> 06:23.634
Two guys who have a tape of their boss
admitting to phone hacking.

06:23.718 --> 06:28.473
How do these people boo a soldier?
How do the candidates say nothing?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.266
And how are you a member of this party?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.601
I'm changing it from within.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.561
Like Pacino in <i>Scarface.</i>

06:33.644 --> 06:35.646
Have you ever seen any of these movies?

06:35.730 --> 06:37.231
- I should.
- Yeah.

06:37.315 --> 06:40.068
So here's something.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.402
You remember Nina Howard?

06:41.486 --> 06:43.112
I definitely remember Nina Howard.

06:43.196 --> 06:45.907
She called Jan in the press office
a couple hours ago.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.076
She knows you didn't have the flu on 9/11.

06:48.159 --> 06:50.912
- Shit, Charlie! I knew this was gonna happen.
- It's not that big a deal.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.164
It's a very big deal. I look like an idiot.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.707
- It could be worse.
- How?

06:54.791 --> 06:55.917
I could look like an idiot.

06:56.709 --> 06:59.420
- You know what?
- That was simple comedy structure.

06:59.504 --> 07:01.297
I had an open jump shot and I took it.

07:02.006 --> 07:04.300
- What do you want to do about this?
- We have two options.

07:04.383 --> 07:08.971
Jan says we do nothing.
We don't respond, it goes away in 48 hours.

07:09.055 --> 07:13.101
The other option is we stick to our story.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.852
Tell me those options again.

07:14.936 --> 07:18.940
- We do nothing, or we stick to our story.
- There's a third option.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.608
- No, there's not.
- It involves having faith...

07:20.691 --> 07:22.527
- No one has faith.
- ...in my mission to civilize.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.613
I really thought we were done
with the mission to civilize.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.782
Was Don Quixote de la Mancha
done with his mission to civilize?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.450
Yeah, he died of being crazy.

07:29.534 --> 07:31.285
So that one you know,
but not <i>The Godfather?</i>

07:31.369 --> 07:35.206
We say nothing,
which is what I strongly recommend.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.582
Or we tell the truth.

07:36.666 --> 07:38.626
The truth isn't even on the table.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.836
- I sit down with her.
- No.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.629
- I tell her exactly what happened.
- No.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.089
- And I appeal...
- To what?

07:43.172 --> 07:45.133
...to her God-given humanity.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.635
God didn't give her humanity.
That's why she's a gossip columnist.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.303
God gave us all humanity.

07:49.387 --> 07:51.430
Let's look at the tape
of the people booing a guy

07:51.514 --> 07:53.057
while he was in the middle
of saving their lives.

07:53.141 --> 07:56.477
I have no explanation for that,
but the bitchiness has to stop, Charlie.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.104
We're inhaling it like it's a carbon emission

07:58.187 --> 08:01.524
blowing out the exhaust pipe
of the crosstown bus we're stuck behind.

08:01.607 --> 08:05.153
Snark is the idiot's version of wit,
and we're being polluted by it like it's...

08:05.236 --> 08:06.237
You know, like it's...

08:06.320 --> 08:08.823
Blowing from the exhaust pipe
of the crosstown bus we're stuck behind.

08:08.906 --> 08:12.660
Yes, that still works. And all it takes,
Charlie, all it takes is one great man.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.744
Kill me.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.538
- A friend of the angels.
- A close friend?

08:15.621 --> 08:18.166
- Don't mock this.
- It's literally impossible not to.

08:18.249 --> 08:21.002
There are things we can do, Charlie,
things we can do every day.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.086
Things that are free.

08:22.170 --> 08:24.839
We can be one inch nicer to each other.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.176
An inch more polite. We can be decent.

08:30.928 --> 08:31.929
Maybe.

08:32.889 --> 08:36.350
But in the meantime,
we should just keep lying about...

08:36.434 --> 08:38.686
I'm gonna meet with Nina Howard.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.563
Nothing about that idea is good.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.064
How about its honesty and honor?

08:42.148 --> 08:44.192
Trumped by its peril and stupidity.

08:44.275 --> 08:47.445
Please ask Jan
to set up a meeting for Monday.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.574
(SIGHS) An off-the-record meeting.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.870
And so it was that the mild-mannered reporter
donned his cape and tights...

08:55.953 --> 08:58.998
And transformed himself
into a delusional drag queen.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.042
Okay, can I just say that
it's this kind of attitude

09:01.125 --> 09:02.919
that makes you Sancho
instead of the main guy?

09:03.002 --> 09:06.380
I'd tell you to call me and let me know
how it goes, but I've got you on Google Alert.

09:06.464 --> 09:07.715
Got it.

09:09.175 --> 09:13.471
At our next event at Rollins Park, the
Governor's message will be simple and clear.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.807
He'll be reiterating his role
as a business leader and job creator,

09:16.891 --> 09:20.895
and he'll focus as well on the failures of
ObamaCare to meet the needs of the country.

09:20.978 --> 09:21.979
Jim?

09:22.063 --> 09:24.774
I'd like to read you
the e-mail you sent us last night.

09:24.857 --> 09:27.735
"At tomorrow's event, the Governor's
message will be simple and clear.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.780
"He'll be reiterating his role
as a business leader and job creator,

09:30.863 --> 09:35.076
"and he'll focus as well on the failures of
ObamaCare to meet the needs of the country."

09:35.159 --> 09:36.577
Is there a question?

09:36.661 --> 09:38.788
Okay, Governor Romney said
we can't reduce our debt

09:38.871 --> 09:42.333
without changes to the entitlement programs.
What changes is he proposing?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.001
- He's laid out his plan.
- No, he hasn't.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.169
- Go to our website.
- I'm there right now.

09:45.253 --> 09:46.671
- You can read about our plan.
- There's no plan.

09:46.796 --> 09:48.714
(ALL GROANING)

09:48.881 --> 09:51.384
Current seniors would have nothing
to worry about. We made a promise...

09:51.467 --> 09:54.762
"Promise to our parents and our grandparents
and that's a promise we need to..."

09:54.845 --> 09:55.805
Okay, I get it.

09:55.888 --> 09:56.889
- Do you?
- Yeah.

09:56.973 --> 10:00.518
I don't think you do, because while those are
sentences and everything, they're not a plan.

10:01.519 --> 10:03.854
If we don't figure out
how to stop spending and cut this debt,

10:03.938 --> 10:05.856
we'll be leaving a terrible burden
to our children.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.901
There's no one who disagrees with that.
What's the Governor's plan?

10:08.985 --> 10:10.903
Obviously,
we have to look at entitlement reform.

10:10.987 --> 10:14.448
- Okay, good. What kinds of reforms?
- That's all laid out in the Governor's plan.

10:14.532 --> 10:17.410
- Are you a cyborg?
- Are you a moron?

10:17.493 --> 10:21.289
You think you're scoring wise-ass points,
and he's plainly fucking with you.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.457
You've heard the only answer
you're going to hear.

10:23.541 --> 10:26.711
Learn how this works,
'cause you're driving the rest of us crazy.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.675
- You can't blame me for trying.
- I am. I'm blaming you for trying.

10:32.758 --> 10:33.801
Any other questions?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.386
Can I get 30 minutes
with the candidate today?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.888
- No. Anything else?
- Lunch will be?

10:37.972 --> 10:40.349
- Turkey sandwiches.
- Turkey sandwiches.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.269
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

10:48.733 --> 10:49.692
Yeah?

10:49.775 --> 10:52.028
- You can speed-read?
- I hope so.

10:52.111 --> 10:55.072
Okay, well, I wanted to see if there was
anyone around with a military background.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.157
Why?

10:56.240 --> 10:59.493
Eric Sweeney is taking the train in
from Trenton to sit down with me.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.787
I want to make sure
I don't miss any acronyms.

11:01.871 --> 11:03.289
- Ah. Jerry, I...
- Why is it so crazy

11:03.372 --> 11:05.958
that we'd use gas
if our soldiers were in immediate danger?

11:06.042 --> 11:09.962
For one thing, we destroyed our
chemical weapons after the 1997 CWC accord.

11:10.046 --> 11:12.089
- The Chemical...
- I know what the CWC is.

11:12.173 --> 11:16.010
And that process was supposed to be
completed in 2007, but wasn't and hasn't yet.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.553
We have sarin gas.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.097
I'm gonna go with you.

11:20.181 --> 11:23.059
- I want to meet Sweeney.
- Now we're talking. Noon?

11:23.142 --> 11:24.685
- Come by and get me.
- Good morning.

11:24.769 --> 11:25.728
- How you doing?
- Good.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.064
- Good.
- All right.

11:28.147 --> 11:30.024
- You know what opened four days ago?
- What?

11:30.107 --> 11:33.277
Park51, the Ground Zero mosque.
It turns out the sky didn't fall down.

11:33.361 --> 11:35.446
- It opened?
- Nobody, including us, covered it.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.157
I found out by walking in there.
I said, "You guys open?" They said, "Yeah."

11:38.240 --> 11:39.658
I wonder why people hate the media.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.370
How did Nina Howard
find out I didn't have the flu?

11:42.453 --> 11:43.829
I don't know. I'm sorry.

11:43.913 --> 11:45.456
You gave me a lecture about trusting the staff.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.874
- I was right.
- Somebody leaked it.

11:46.957 --> 11:47.958
Nobody on the staff.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.669
- They were the only ones who knew.
- Nobody on the staff would leak it.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.588
You see the problem here?

11:52.671 --> 11:55.216
- Charlie said you're meeting with her.
- I am.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.551
Would it mean anything
if I told you that was a terrible idea?

11:57.635 --> 11:59.261
- No.
- What are you gonna say to her?

11:59.345 --> 12:01.972
I'm gonna ask her
if we can be a little bit human for a day.

12:02.056 --> 12:06.268
I'm gonna ask her if 9/11
can be declared a scandal-free zone.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.940
You know,
I had a nice conversation with her once.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.234
- When?
- When you were in the hospital

12:13.317 --> 12:15.861
and she told me she knew you were high
the night we got bin Laden.

12:15.945 --> 12:18.030
She didn't tell me she knew
because Reese had hacked my phone.

12:18.114 --> 12:21.200
She couldn't, but she expressed remorse.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.326
We had a connection.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.953
That's great.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.871
- And speaking of voice mail...
- We weren't.

12:25.955 --> 12:26.914
- A little bit.
- No.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.416
- Tangentially.
- I don't remember.

12:28.499 --> 12:31.293
"I'm not just saying this because I'm high..."

12:31.377 --> 12:32.586
Mac.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.464
- You know what I think?
- What?

12:35.548 --> 12:37.883
I think you got home
after the bin Laden broadcast,

12:37.967 --> 12:42.346
and for a minute, just a minute,
you forgot that you were mad at me.

12:42.430 --> 12:43.931
- Listen.
- You forgot for a minute

12:44.014 --> 12:48.144
that you'd made a pledge
to be mad at me for the rest of your life.

12:59.405 --> 13:02.616
Let's speak really quietly, okay?
I'm not mad at you.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.953
You didn't dent my fender.
You didn't stand me up for a date.

13:06.036 --> 13:06.996
- I'm not mad at you.
- I know.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.247
- I'm not your gay best friend.
- God.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.417
You were back with Brian for four months
while you were with me.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.295
And you... That's flat... I don't get it.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.380
Do you wanna see the e-mails you sent me
while you were with him?

13:16.464 --> 13:20.092
I'm never gonna get it.
So the small favor you can do for me

13:20.176 --> 13:23.596
is not saying something as inane as,
"You forgot you were mad at me."

13:23.679 --> 13:27.558
Because sometimes,
you're not as cute as you think you are.

13:29.143 --> 13:32.438
- You're right.
- I want to know who leaked the story.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.448
TAYLOR: The campaign's happy to announce

13:42.531 --> 13:44.992
the results of the latest
<i>New Hampshire Journal</i> poll,

13:45.075 --> 13:47.328
which has Governor Romney in the lead

13:47.411 --> 13:50.498
with 37% of New Hampshire's
likely Republican voters,

13:50.581 --> 13:53.834
well ahead of Rick Perry with 18%,

13:53.918 --> 13:55.836
Ron Paul with 14%,

13:55.920 --> 13:57.838
then Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.

13:57.922 --> 14:00.466
You forgot about
Huntsman, Gingrich and Santorum.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.218
- And soon you will, too.
- Taylor?

14:02.301 --> 14:05.971
- We have a new student in class.
- Jim Harper, ACN.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.140
Jim Harper, ACN.

14:08.224 --> 14:10.726
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.437
When the gay soldier asked his question,

14:13.521 --> 14:18.150
did Will McAvoy expect the candidates
to waterboard each member of the audience

14:18.234 --> 14:21.278
until they admitted to exercising
their First Amendment rights?

14:21.362 --> 14:23.113
- I doubt it.
- What did he expect?

14:23.197 --> 14:26.367
I guess for at least one of them,
perhaps the front runner,

14:26.450 --> 14:30.996
to tell the audience that he wasn't interested
in the votes of anyone who was booing.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.541
Not for nothing,
but he'd have won the election that night.

14:33.624 --> 14:37.002
- How long have you been covering politics?
- Almost two weeks.

14:37.795 --> 14:39.213
Right.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.756
What is your question, Jim?

14:40.839 --> 14:45.261
In the past, Governor Romney said that his
proudest accomplishment in public service

14:45.344 --> 14:47.513
was bringing health care reform
to Massachusetts.

14:47.596 --> 14:51.141
I've been to 28 events in 11 days,
and he hasn't brought that up.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.060
- And your question?
- We're really gonna do this?

14:53.143 --> 14:55.563
- Has anyone on the bus asked why?
- No. Thank God you got here.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.315
- Taylor, why is it...
- Governor Romney is very proud

14:58.399 --> 15:01.610
of his accomplishments in Massachusetts
with regard to health care.

15:01.694 --> 15:04.405
But his plan is nothing like ObamaCare,

15:04.488 --> 15:08.284
which the Governor has promised to repeal
on his first day in office.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.452
- What exactly are the differences?
- All right, that's it, guys.

15:13.122 --> 15:15.207
- One more question?
- Sure.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.042
What do you expect us to report tonight?

15:17.126 --> 15:18.752
The Governor was in good spirits today

15:18.836 --> 15:22.047
as the campaign touted the results
of the latest <i>New Hampshire Journal</i> poll...

15:22.131 --> 15:24.425
A new poll has the Romney campaign
feeling good about its chances...

15:24.508 --> 15:27.219
And a senior campaign spokesperson
reiterating the candidate's pledge

15:27.303 --> 15:28.679
that a President Romney
would repeal ObamaCare...

15:28.762 --> 15:32.975
...and expressing no expectation of surges
from Huntsman, Gingrich or Santorum.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.687
With the Romney campaign in Concord,
I'm Jim Harper, ACN.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.773
ERIC: I was stationed
with a MARSOC unit in J-bad.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.942
Marine Special Operations Command
in Jalalabad.

15:42.026 --> 15:44.320
- I know.
- Intel had location on Marine POWs

15:44.403 --> 15:46.155
who'd been separated
from their unit three days earlier

15:46.238 --> 15:47.615
during a firefight in the Hindu Kush.

15:47.698 --> 15:48.991
They'd been smuggled across the border.

15:49.074 --> 15:52.620
Pakistani Taliban intended to sell them
to al-Qaeda for propaganda purposes.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.288
You mean like,
"Hey, look, we got some Americans"?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.123
I mean like, "Hey, look, we beheaded some."

15:56.957 --> 15:59.335
We had to get to them before
they moved again, or else we'd lose them.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.462
The target was a village inside the FATA.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.006
- What were you told to expect?
- Taliban fighters.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.342
Potentially, Pakistani QRF
responding to our border invasion.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.426
Quick Reaction Force.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.387
We ran rehearsals for 48 hours.
That's when things got different.

16:10.471 --> 16:11.680
What was different?

16:11.764 --> 16:15.684
We were practicing in full MOPP gear.
Mission oriented protective posture.

16:15.768 --> 16:17.645
- It's like a hazmat suit.
- I know.

16:17.728 --> 16:22.358
Two helos, 15 operators each.
We cross into Pakistan. No IDs, no dog tags.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.943
- Without permission?
- I'm not the guy who gets permission.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.363
Two helos. Any backup?

16:27.446 --> 16:28.781
It was two years ago.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.368
I think I remember
we asked for an AC-130 Spectre gunship

16:32.451 --> 16:36.747
to loiter on the Afghanistan side, but either
it didn't get authorized, or it didn't show up.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.292
The 60s had.50-cal door guns.
AH-1s had rockets on the skids.

16:40.376 --> 16:41.335
AH-1s are Cobras.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.755
We had a few guys carrying
new HE rounds for the M203s, M79s.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.008
We got on board at 0400
and were on the target before dawn.

16:48.092 --> 16:49.802
- HE is...
- High explosive.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.845
- Everything all right here?
- We're good, thank you.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.807
Amy, could you do me a favor and not
seat anyone nearby if you don't have to?

16:54.890 --> 16:55.974
Yeah.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.647
Things went bad right away.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.900
You want to make God laugh,
tell him you rehearsed for an extraction.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.819
A bunch of fighters come out of the hills
as soon as we land,

17:06.902 --> 17:08.570
and I'm sorry for the language, ma'am,

17:08.654 --> 17:12.366
but there was a shit-ton of civilians in
the village and we weren't prepared for that.

17:12.449 --> 17:16.161
The helos started laying down
white phosphorus to cover us.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.289
You're saying you shot white phosphorus?

17:19.373 --> 17:20.416
Yes, ma'am.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.084
White phosphorus?

17:22.167 --> 17:24.169
- What does it do?
- Depends how you use it.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.921
I thought we were using it for cover.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.631
Then one of the choppers
fired a missile right near us.

17:27.715 --> 17:29.550
We're going door-to-door
looking for our guys.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.552
All of a sudden,
I'm tripping over people screaming.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.096
Women, children,
boils and burns on their faces.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.931
Some of them passed out.
I hadn't seen anything like it.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.767
A couple of my buddies grabbed our guys
out of a hole in one of the houses,

17:38.851 --> 17:41.729
hit 'em with an atropine, dragged them
to the helos, and we all got out of there.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.440
So later, I'm talking to the crew,
and I ask them about the weapons package.

17:44.523 --> 17:47.651
Why did the white phosphorous do that?
The guy said it wasn't white phosphorous.

17:47.735 --> 17:49.611
I said, "Well, what was it?"

17:53.490 --> 17:55.367
He said, "Sarin."

18:12.885 --> 18:15.888
Would you write down as many names
as you can remember, please?

18:27.691 --> 18:29.359
Am I about to be murdered?

18:29.443 --> 18:32.571
You look good, Nina.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.617
Are you sure the AWM executive dining room
is the safest place to meet?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.118
I am. I've had it closed.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.621
You came in through the freight entrance
and rode the elevator alone

18:40.704 --> 18:44.166
except for this gentleman, who's a former
New York City police detective.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.919
- You have that kind of muscle?
- Right now, you have that kind of muscle.

18:47.002 --> 18:48.462
But I don't want to talk to you
about power today.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.632
I want to talk to you about something else.
Come on over and sit down.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.384
- Would you like a mimosa?
- What?

18:54.468 --> 18:56.136
- Champagne and orange juice.
- I know what it is.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.264
Pierre, a mimosa for Miss Howard, please.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.474
No pulp, correct?

19:00.557 --> 19:03.101
- Yes.
- I learned that on Facebook.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.728
- No pulp.
- Right away.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.946
- Is his name really Pierre?
- No.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.405
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you asked.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.990
I think anybody would have.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.786
You can start a revolution, Nina.
You can fire the shot heard 'round the world.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.704
And that's an apt analogy,

19:22.788 --> 19:25.290
because no one knows
which side the guy was on who fired the shot.

19:25.374 --> 19:28.210
But nonetheless, it led to a revolution
that it was good that we won.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.336
- Will.
- Yeah?

19:29.419 --> 19:32.005
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- I didn't have the flu.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.634
We felt that with the controversy created
by my remarks about the Tea Party,

19:35.717 --> 19:39.012
the 9/11 anniversary coverage
should be handled by someone else.

19:39.096 --> 19:44.226
And so Sloan Sabbith and Elliot Hirsch
anchored, and I pretended to have the flu.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.811
You forgot to say we're off the record.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.188
We're not. We're on the record.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.400
Why are you being this way?

19:51.483 --> 19:52.609
Wayne.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.572
(PLAYING
<i>WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW IS LOVE)</i>

19:56.697 --> 20:00.117
- Dear God.
- Yep.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.454
I don't believe in censorship,
but I'm a big believer in self-censorship.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.831
You've got a scoop.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.709
You can write a story
that embarrasses me and the network,

20:08.792 --> 20:10.961
or you can say that's all the story is.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.840
You can say,
"I've had a belly full of this bullying bullshit."

20:14.923 --> 20:17.634
You're financially secure?
You've invested wisely?

20:17.718 --> 20:19.845
I invested in my parents' will.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.223
- So you don't need the $250?
- I'd get a lot more than $250.

20:23.307 --> 20:26.560
Sorry, you don't need the $275.

20:27.477 --> 20:33.275
Did Reese or Leona Lansing take you off
the anniversary, or did you do it voluntarily?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.905
Charlie Skinner took me off.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.740
And I get that's where the story is,

20:39.823 --> 20:42.910
but, Nina, are we okay with
being Mean Girls and Heathers

20:42.993 --> 20:45.621
and whatever the male equivalent of that is?

20:45.704 --> 20:47.164
<i>- Lord of the Flies.</i>
<i>- Lord of the Flies.</i>

20:47.247 --> 20:50.000
Well, in <i>Lord of the Flies...</i>
Sure, yes, <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

20:50.083 --> 20:51.793
9/11 is a sacred day.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.588
- Maybe that could be the one day...
- All right.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.173
- What?
- I won't run it.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.425
Seriously?

20:58.508 --> 21:01.595
I liked that you told me the truth when
I asked if you took yourself off voluntarily.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.180
- You did?
- Yeah.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.225
So it worked?

21:08.352 --> 21:11.855
Wow. We... Look at that.

21:14.107 --> 21:19.154
Okay, well, enjoy the rest of your mimosa
and that'll... That's that.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.781
- That's that.
- All right.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.741
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:39.424 --> 21:44.054
Do you think you'd like to go out sometime
to dinner or a movie on a date with me?

21:44.137 --> 21:46.890
I'd love to, but I won't.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.059
Okay.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.104
All right.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.147
I'm sorry, you'd love to, but you won't?

21:54.231 --> 21:59.027
You've forgotten that I heard the voice mail
that you left for MacKenzie.

21:59.111 --> 22:00.278
Right.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.364
The voice mail I left...

22:02.447 --> 22:05.325
Wayne, could you stop playing for a minute?
We're good.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.410
I would love to go out with you.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.787
I wanted to go out with you
New Year's Eve a year ago,

22:08.870 --> 22:12.374
the first time that you told me
that you had no respect for me and what I do.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.002
- But you're in love with MacKenzie.
- I'm not.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.546
I was years ago, but we just work together.

22:17.629 --> 22:22.384
Now, I like her, I depend on her, she's my EP,
but she runs my show and that's it.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.468
The message said...

22:23.552 --> 22:24.928
- You don't have to say what it said.
- It said...

22:25.012 --> 22:28.682
- It's all right.
- It said, "Hey, Mac, it's me.

22:28.765 --> 22:32.602
"Look, I'm not just saying this
because I'm high.

22:32.686 --> 22:36.565
"I've never stopped loving you.
You were spectacular tonight."

22:38.275 --> 22:42.946
Then there's a pause and you say,
"Can you believe we got Obama?"

22:45.157 --> 22:47.117
- I meant bin Laden.
- Yeah, I know.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.494
- And that was a long time ago.
- It was May.

22:49.578 --> 22:51.830
I'd eaten two massive,

22:51.913 --> 22:54.082
we're off the record now, cookies laced with...

22:54.166 --> 22:56.460
- I know. I know.
- We'd been on the air till 4:00 a.m.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.379
I had adrenaline and THC
coursing through my, you know...

22:59.463 --> 23:00.464
- Brain?
- Yes!

23:00.547 --> 23:02.132
I don't know
what courses through your brain,

23:03.467 --> 23:06.845
but I listened to that voice mail
100 times before I destroyed it,

23:06.928 --> 23:09.473
and that message was the real thing.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.354
Didn't you ever wonder
why she didn't call you back?

23:16.438 --> 23:17.606
You guys erased the message.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.524
Well, you didn't know that at the time.

23:19.608 --> 23:22.235
You know, I thought...

23:22.319 --> 23:25.238
- What, you thought she'd moved on?
- Uh-huh.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.948
You're an idiot.

23:28.283 --> 23:29.367
Yeah.

23:33.872 --> 23:37.459
So, no to the date,
but I thought everything else went really well.

23:37.542 --> 23:38.585
Mm-hmm.

23:38.668 --> 23:42.089
Welcome to the high ground
in McAvoy's team of champions.

23:42.172 --> 23:44.508
And thank you.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.095
The guy's paid for an hour, so...

23:48.178 --> 23:49.513
Okay.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.350
It was nice of you to destroy the message.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.359
They'll take you back down
when you're ready.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.906
CHARLIE: You asked him
to tell you classified information and he did?

24:07.989 --> 24:10.200
MACKENZIE: I know.
JERRY: Whistle-blowers can be patriots.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.993
CHARLIE: And he doesn't remember the date?

24:12.077 --> 24:14.704
He remembers it was around March 9th, 2009.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.414
Do you remember dates from two years ago?

24:16.498 --> 24:20.127
I would if I dropped sarin gas on a small town.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.004
- And he said they shot white phosphorus?
- Yeah.

24:23.088 --> 24:26.091
If they shot white phosphorus
into an enclosed area,

24:26.174 --> 24:29.052
that alone would be chemical warfare.
Just the white phosphorus.

24:30.095 --> 24:32.013
- What about his discharge?
- Honorable.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.975
- Has he talked to anyone else?
- No, just me. Us.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.227
- Why?
- Nobody's asked.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.353
That's a bullshit answer.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.147
- No, it's not.
- It is.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.399
- Did his hands shake or were they steady?
- Steady.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.152
He remembered a lot of details
and his story sounded a little rehearsed.

24:45.235 --> 24:46.486
- Didn't to me.
- No criminal record

24:46.570 --> 24:47.863
and we're checking his credit.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.573
Guy owes money on a Jet Ski,
we're not gonna believe him?

24:49.656 --> 24:53.618
I've never flown an MH-60, but the old Hueys
couldn't handle that altitude, right?

24:53.702 --> 24:54.828
He said it was a Black Hawk?

24:55.912 --> 24:58.165
Black Hawks
are what we sent in to get bin Laden.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.208
Abbottabad is 4,000 feet above sea level,

25:00.292 --> 25:02.627
and most of the villages in Waziristan
are over 9,000.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.588
That's pretty thin air for rotating blades.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.256
JERRY: Maybe it wasn't a Black Hawk,

25:06.339 --> 25:08.425
or maybe, excuse me,
we're not experts in military helicopters.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.178
- She is.
- I'm not.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.847
Well, obviously, you have to follow up.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.349
Just do it quietly and carefully.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.435
We understand we're talking about
an impeachable offense.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.604
- It's a war crime.
- We've committed them before.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.023
I know. I was there.

25:24.441 --> 25:27.110
- Just can you give us a second?
- Yeah.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.158
Do you believe this story?

25:33.241 --> 25:35.368
I mean, you can't possibly believe this story.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.370
No.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.707
But what if someone else confirms?
At what point do we have to take it seriously?

25:40.790 --> 25:43.418
(SCOFFS) We'll never find that out.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.253
All right.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.298
I'm commandeering
this desk clump right here.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.550
Anyone who works here,
move your stuff someplace else.

25:50.634 --> 25:53.553
Martin, Tamara, Tess, you're working with me.
Maggie.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.472
- Yeah?
- You're on this team.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.557
We're splitting this list into five sections,

25:57.641 --> 26:00.894
and we don't stop
until we have tracked down every name on it.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.146
All right.
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.731
I'm gonna brief you. Everybody huddle up.

26:04.814 --> 26:09.903
Jerry, this is something they and you do
when they and you have nothing else to do.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.030
Rundown meeting.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.157
I'll brief everyone after.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.369
- How was the doctor?
- I'm good to go.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.621
I could swallow a petri dish full of smallpox,

26:19.704 --> 26:22.082
and my immune system
would laugh the laugh of the righteous.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.583
- Malaria?
- Covered.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.586
- Mefloquine or doxycycline?
- I'm not sure.

26:26.670 --> 26:30.173
You want to be sure
because mefloquine has possible side effects.

26:30.257 --> 26:32.425
- Mefloquine.
- I told you to get the doxycycline.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.886
Yes, but one of them is
for people with fair skin, and that's me.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.513
Do you know
what the possible side effects are?

26:36.596 --> 26:37.597
Nope.

26:37.681 --> 26:38.974
Check it out.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.605
All right, around the table.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.066
The court's gonna rule on the ACA
early next year.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.277
Justice is declining to appeal
to the Eleventh Circuit.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.238
Saudi Arabian women
will be given the right to vote in 2015.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.906
Romney's meeting with Trump tomorrow.

26:54.990 --> 26:57.659
- Oh, my God!
- There it is.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.539
- "Depression, confusion, hallucinations..."
- Yeah.

27:02.622 --> 27:06.626
"Severe vomiting, suicidal thoughts,
homicidal thoughts and extreme fear."

27:06.710 --> 27:08.753
Easy enough to understand
where the extreme fear comes from.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.673
- Anything else?
- "Itching."

27:11.756 --> 27:14.050
I'm gonna be itchy
while I'm confused and hallucinating.

27:14.134 --> 27:17.512
If at all possible, have the suicidal thoughts
before the homicidal thoughts.

27:17.595 --> 27:18.638
Didn't you get the same thing?

27:18.722 --> 27:21.433
I got the doxycycline.
I don't have fair skin, just soft skin.

27:21.516 --> 27:24.352
- Does doxycycline have side effects?
- Sun sensitivity.

27:24.436 --> 27:25.603
Okay.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.648
Don't take it.
Go back and tell them you want the doxy.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.070
You already took it.

27:34.154 --> 27:37.282
I can feel my mood changing. I can feel it.
It's happening right now.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.451
- Let's keep going.
- MARTIN: There's Friday's address at the UN

27:39.534 --> 27:41.786
by Mahmoud Abbas
pressing the case for Palestinian...

27:41.870 --> 27:43.997
Shut up, Martin. The UN can go to hell.

27:45.332 --> 27:47.417
The drug takes about a week to kick in.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.586
- When did you take the pill?
- Ten minutes ago.

27:49.669 --> 27:53.048
- So...
- I'm confused and experiencing extreme fear.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.425
Uh-huh. Keep going.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.260
The Conrad Murray trial begins tomorrow.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.722
That's 30 seconds buried deep somewhere,
preferably when we're in a commercial.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.390
- Good afternoon.
- How'd it go?

28:02.474 --> 28:03.516
I have two things to say.

28:03.600 --> 28:07.729
People are fundamentally good,
and who the fuck leaked I wasn't sick on 9/11?

28:07.812 --> 28:10.106
Everyone's gonna close their eyes,
including me,

28:10.190 --> 28:12.984
and the person who couldn't keep
their mouth shut is gonna raise their hand.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.861
That wouldn't work.
That doesn't make any sense.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.322
- Can I ask something?
- Sure, this meeting's off the rails.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.991
Saturday, the day before yesterday,
there was an OWS march.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.701
It didn't make it to the 2:00 rundown.

28:21.785 --> 28:25.205
- Was it out this morning at 11:00?
- Yes. I put it up this morning at 11:00.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.791
There was a march through
the Financial District that was interrupted

28:27.874 --> 28:30.960
by the NYPD using excessive force
and pepper spray without being provoked.

28:31.044 --> 28:34.714
I saw the film. I don't know.
Maybe. If there's time.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.342
There's time right there
where Mitt Romney meets Donald Trump.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.094
We're totally doing that story.

28:39.177 --> 28:41.513
And seriously,
when I find out which one of your roommates,

28:41.596 --> 28:45.141
which one of your boyfriends,
which one of your baristas gave me up,

28:45.225 --> 28:48.144
I know some of you have
special relationships with your baristas.

28:48.228 --> 28:51.564
I don't understand that part of the world,
but I am gonna own somebody here.

28:51.648 --> 28:53.733
There's gonna be a heartache tonight.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.402
How are you even supposed to know
if you're delusional?

28:55.485 --> 29:00.156
This was a colossal waste of time,
so I'm going to try meeting with graphics.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.287
Mac.

29:08.415 --> 29:11.292
I'm sorry about this morning.
I don't know where that came from.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.629
I know where it came from, but still...

29:16.673 --> 29:20.969
Honestly, I'm impressed
it doesn't happen more.

29:21.052 --> 29:23.179
Impressed is the wrong word.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.063
(LAUGHING) I can't think of the right word.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.524
That's okay.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.401
- Anyway...
- All right.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.613
Nothing on the march
in New York on Saturday.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.407
A friend of mine in the newsroom's
gonna lose it.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.534
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.370
Tequila!

29:47.454 --> 29:49.664
What does that do for you,
shouting "tequila"?

29:49.747 --> 29:50.957
How does that enhance the experience?

29:51.040 --> 29:52.834
- I don't know.
- Until you do...

29:52.917 --> 29:54.586
- Stop?
- Yeah.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.212
- What was the girl's name?
- It doesn't matter.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.131
It does because
I don't want to accidentally use her real name

29:58.214 --> 29:59.424
when I'm writing the story in my blog.

29:59.507 --> 30:01.426
- Don't write it in your blog.
- "Tales From the Trail."

30:01.509 --> 30:02.469
Write about Romney.

30:02.552 --> 30:04.762
When Romney jumps off
a <i>Sex and the City</i> tour bus to chase a girl,

30:04.846 --> 30:06.514
I'll definitely write about it.
Now, what was her name?

30:06.598 --> 30:08.766
Guys, I think Jim
would like a little space on this.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.810
- We can just leave it alone.
- Thank you.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.645
- What was her name?
- HALLIE: Maggie.

30:12.729 --> 30:15.732
Her name is Maggie.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.150
How did you know that?

30:17.233 --> 30:19.736
You've called me Maggie twice
since you got here.

30:19.903 --> 30:20.904
ALL: Ooh!

30:21.070 --> 30:22.238
Tequila!

30:22.322 --> 30:24.282
- Cameron.
- Thirty minutes with the candidate?

30:24.365 --> 30:26.034
- Yeah.
- Nope.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.126
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

30:35.919 --> 30:37.587
Come on in.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.924
Okay, so what are you...
What's happening here?

30:41.007 --> 30:43.635
I started by putting tires on my chair.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.345
Tires?

30:45.428 --> 30:47.138
Little tires. They go on your chair.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.765
They give you better traction
to zip around the room.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.266
And then there were some parts
that were squeaking,

30:50.350 --> 30:52.060
so I got some WD-40 and here I am.

30:52.143 --> 30:53.853
Are you gonna be able to
put this back together?

30:53.937 --> 30:55.688
Yeah, I'm good with my hands.
I'm handy, mechanical.

30:55.772 --> 30:57.398
What can I do for you?

30:57.482 --> 30:58.983
I'm having a tough time with Zane.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.693
Aren't you always having
a tough time with him?

31:00.777 --> 31:02.445
Not because of me. I'm delightful.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.696
Here's the thing.

31:03.780 --> 31:04.781
Lockheed is a good buy right now

31:04.864 --> 31:07.617
because they make the Hellfire missile,
which is shot out of a Predator drone.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.369
I'm advising my viewers not to buy the stock.

31:09.452 --> 31:10.453
You just said it was a good buy.

31:10.537 --> 31:11.871
It's a great buy if you like money.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.289
But you think it's an immoral stock.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.375
- I do. You know why?
- Yeah, 'cause they make drone missiles.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.417
You get me.

31:16.501 --> 31:18.044
And Zane doesn't want you
to go on the air and say that.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.128
That's close.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.214
You already went on the air and said it,
and now Zane's pissed.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.257
That's exactly it, yeah.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.217
Okay, personally, I think that
your position is commendable,

31:24.300 --> 31:25.677
but you have to listen to your EP.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.719
- Okay.
- All right.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.221
- And one more thing.
- Yeah?

31:28.304 --> 31:29.389
I'm pretty sure I'm the leak.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.975
- Say again?
- Will not having the flu.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.727
I'm pretty sure I'm the leak. I'm the leak.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.107
- How'd that happen?
- A guy invited me to a wedding.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.900
When I was told
I would be doing the 9/11 coverage,

31:40.984 --> 31:42.318
I had to tell him why
I couldn't go to the wedding,

31:42.402 --> 31:43.945
and I could tell he didn't quite believe me,

31:44.028 --> 31:46.489
so I had to make
a very convincing and detailed case

31:46.573 --> 31:48.658
because I told him before
Will didn't get the flu.

31:48.741 --> 31:51.119
- You see my point?
- Yeah.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.287
A guy invited you to a wedding?

31:52.370 --> 31:54.414
Just a friend.
That's not important information.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.083
How'd the story have gotten
from the wedding guy to Nina Howard?

31:57.166 --> 31:59.752
- Nina has a book agent.
- Yeah?

31:59.836 --> 32:01.921
The wedding guy was...
You told Nina Howard's agent?

32:02.005 --> 32:04.215
In my defense,
I was accused of lying to get out of a date.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.384
- That's a terrible defense.
- I agree, so what would you do?

32:06.467 --> 32:08.845
- Don't say a word to Will.
- Just tell Will the truth, right?

32:08.928 --> 32:12.599
Okay, I'll do it your way
while I'm formulating another plan.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.225
- Run that plan by me first, okay?
- Yeah.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.102
Thanks for agreeing with me
on the immoral stock.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.814
And I in no way think that this here
is a reaction to your breakup with Maggie.

32:19.897 --> 32:22.609
Well, you were gonna go to a wedding
with a book agent for no reason at all,

32:22.692 --> 32:23.943
and book agents beat their wives.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.529
I don't think they do.

32:26.613 --> 32:29.324
- Ask around.
- I will.

32:29.407 --> 32:30.825
- JIM: <i>Taylor.</i>
<i>- Jim.</i>

32:30.908 --> 32:34.287
In June, Governor Romney said,
"I believe the world is getting warmer,

32:34.370 --> 32:36.289
"and I believe humans
have contributed to that."

32:36.372 --> 32:39.459
Last week he said,
"Do I think the world is getting hotter?

32:39.542 --> 32:42.378
"Yeah. I don't know
if it's caused mostly by humans."

32:42.462 --> 32:44.339
What new information
raised doubts for the Governor?

32:44.422 --> 32:47.008
Governor Romney isn't willing to
spend trillions of dollars

32:47.091 --> 32:48.968
on something he doesn't know the answer to.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.428
Got it, but that wasn't my question.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.723
In June, this last June,
102 days ago, the Governor...

32:53.806 --> 32:55.642
Asked and answered, Jim.

33:10.823 --> 33:14.369
(QUIETLY) I read some of your stuff
last night in my room.

33:14.452 --> 33:18.790
That's a little creepy.
Especially in the quiet voice you're using.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.625
You know, I'm trying to compliment you.

33:20.708 --> 33:23.127
I thought they were really good,
except for the parts that weren't.

33:23.211 --> 33:25.213
And you've been kind of nasty to me
since I got here.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.507
Because we live here and you're visiting.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.717
You're slumming it.
You're a senior studio producer

33:29.801 --> 33:32.512
and you come up here like Captain America
thinking you're gonna school us.

33:32.595 --> 33:35.139
None of that is true.
And some of you need to be schooled.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.767
- This is my third presidential campaign.
- Your third?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.478
I took my junior year off from college
to cover Kerry.

33:40.561 --> 33:41.688
Why'd you leave the <i>Denver Post?</i>

33:41.771 --> 33:43.856
Because once McCain
got the nomination four years later,

33:43.940 --> 33:45.858
I was replaced by someone
with more experience

33:45.942 --> 33:47.902
who didn't ask questions I wanted answers to.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.696
- Like what?
- Like women's issues.

33:49.779 --> 33:53.574
- Choice?
- Yeah. Choice is the only women's issue.

33:53.658 --> 33:55.118
And it's just a women's issue

33:55.201 --> 33:57.578
because we all got pregnant reading
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.</i>

33:59.288 --> 34:01.749
- So you started your own website...
- With an investor.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.419
To make sure you didn't get bigfooted
once Romney gets the nomination...

34:04.502 --> 34:05.503
To write in my own voice.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.713
And ask the questions
you wanted answers to.

34:06.796 --> 34:07.755
Yeah.

34:07.839 --> 34:09.757
How's that part been going?

34:11.175 --> 34:14.011
I'm starting to understand
why Maggie was running so fast.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.599
I was hoping you could run a couple names
through your VA database for me.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.476
Yes, I'm trying to reach
Humboldt County Records.

34:20.560 --> 34:25.398
Marines, probably Special Ops, MARSOC,
and stationed in or near J-bad.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.276
We have one source
and we're trying to get the next.

34:28.359 --> 34:31.070
Can you tell me, have you ever
heard the name Operation Genoa?

34:31.154 --> 34:33.239
- Genoa.
- We should be checking Twitter, too.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.700
- You think somebody saw it?
- Somebody saw us getting bin Laden.

34:36.492 --> 34:39.954
- I don't know. I'm a ticking time bomb.
- That was in... Thank you.

34:40.037 --> 34:43.249
That was in a suburban neighborhood.
This is in the middle of a pile of rocks.

34:43.332 --> 34:47.837
I'd be amazed if a village in North Waziristan
has cell service, let alone Twitter users.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.714
They have cell service.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.007
How do we search every tweet

34:51.090 --> 34:54.594
that was posted in the area
sometime around March 2009?

34:54.677 --> 34:58.347
You're gonna use something called Topsy.
It narrows the area and the dates.

34:58.431 --> 35:00.975
And you're gonna need a translator,
either Urdu or Pashto.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.102
I'll get on it.

35:04.562 --> 35:09.192
You should have today's talking points in
your e-mail, but I will just reiterate them here.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.862
Governor Romney's
very proud of his 59-point jobs plan.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.198
We've named it Day One, Job One,

35:15.281 --> 35:20.703
and it will lower the unemployment rate
from President Obama's 9.1 to 5.9,

35:20.787 --> 35:22.747
creating 12 million new jobs.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.081
Everybody have that?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.500
- Taylor?
- Jim.

35:25.583 --> 35:26.918
Moody's released a report

35:27.001 --> 35:30.087
saying that 12 million new jobs
will be created in the next four years

35:30.171 --> 35:31.631
no matter who the president is.

35:31.714 --> 35:32.924
Does the Governor
have any comment on that?

35:33.007 --> 35:37.595
The Governor's 59-point jobs plan will create
12 million new jobs in his first term,

35:37.678 --> 35:40.014
cutting the unemployment rate almost in half.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.975
5.9 isn't almost half of 9.1,

35:43.059 --> 35:45.311
and Moody's says
that no matter who the president is...

35:45.394 --> 35:48.314
We think it matters very much
who the president is.

35:48.397 --> 35:49.774
- Follow up?
- Yes.

35:49.857 --> 35:52.276
Is there somebody inside you
operating you with controls?

35:53.694 --> 35:55.488
Good one, Jim.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.573
Day One, Job One.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.160
REPORTER: Governor Romney
was in Portsmouth today

36:01.244 --> 36:02.829
to introduce his economic plan,

36:02.912 --> 36:05.873
promising to cut unemployment almost in half
with his 59-point jobs proposal.

36:05.957 --> 36:07.667
Touting his experience in the private sector,

36:07.750 --> 36:10.253
today found the former CEO
campaigning in Portsmouth,

36:10.336 --> 36:13.339
where Governor Romney unveiled
his Day One, Job One plan

36:13.422 --> 36:16.509
that would add 12 million new jobs
in his first term.

36:16.592 --> 36:17.969
The 59-point proposal

36:18.052 --> 36:21.597
promises to cut President Obama's
unemployment rate nearly in half.

36:24.058 --> 36:27.186
You know, Jim, if you'd open up a little,
we could have, like, a bond or something.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.981
Embeds bond on the road.
And there's a lot of sex.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.941
- For who?
- Players gotta play.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.025
- With who?
- Whom.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.569
Shut the fuck up, that's with whom.

36:34.652 --> 36:37.071
- Jim, are you feeling me?
- I really hope not.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.698
JILL: You can't force a bond.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.199
It happens in every road movie.

36:40.283 --> 36:42.910
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.
Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.

36:42.994 --> 36:44.495
Which one of those guys are you?

36:44.579 --> 36:46.372
Bing and Dean.
And you can be Dorothy Lamour.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.790
JILL: I didn't pack my sarong.

36:47.874 --> 36:49.542
STILLMAN:
I'll buy you a sarong if you'll wear it.

36:49.625 --> 36:50.918
ZACH: I'll sew you a sarong if you'll wear it.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.753
JILL: You're not wearing a sarong.

36:52.837 --> 36:55.548
- STILLMAN: So just you?
- JILL: Nobody's wearing a sarong.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.729
You got one.

37:09.812 --> 37:14.025
- Your guy can't just e-mail the translations?
- He doesn't like e-mail.

37:14.108 --> 37:16.152
- Why?
- I didn't follow up.

37:16.235 --> 37:22.450
Wazir_teacher tweets,
"Uncle just intro me to #Misbah-ul-Haq!"

37:22.533 --> 37:23.951
Find out who Misbah-ul-Haq is.

37:24.035 --> 37:25.828
Hang on.

37:27.371 --> 37:28.581
He's a cricket player.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.417
Keep calling.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.794
Get this guy to translate faster.

37:33.878 --> 37:38.382
Neal, listen, I need you to give serious
and immediate attention to the website.

37:38.466 --> 37:42.428
- Are we down? I would have been alerted.
- No, it's up and running, but it's not...

37:42.511 --> 37:44.847
The blog isn't accomplishing what it should.

37:44.931 --> 37:49.852
And even though I can't tell you specifically
what to change, I want a complete overhaul.

37:49.936 --> 37:52.271
I see, you're doing a topical satire of OWS.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.440
Well, I'm not willing to say
exactly what I'm doing,

37:54.523 --> 37:55.733
because I don't want it corrupted
by the media.

37:55.816 --> 37:56.776
It's a good joke.

37:56.859 --> 38:00.112
And while I am the boss, we don't have
"leaders," so there's really no one...

38:00.196 --> 38:01.989
Can I show you something?

38:05.409 --> 38:08.037
We experienced a massive failure
of our banking system,

38:08.120 --> 38:10.623
which devastated the lives
of millions of people, right?

38:10.706 --> 38:14.794
Protesters marched last Saturday
and got pepper sprayed by the police.

38:14.877 --> 38:17.213
This is the Fox coverage, which was about...

38:18.089 --> 38:19.799
Does pepper spray hurt?

38:19.882 --> 38:20.841
<i>Now you see...</i>

38:20.925 --> 38:24.303
<i>Then I guess the pepper spray happens</i>
<i>right there and the women go down.</i>

38:24.387 --> 38:26.889
<i>Arthur, I don't know.</i>
<i>I see these women screaming.</i>

38:26.973 --> 38:28.641
<i>It's like they've been shot in the face.</i>

38:28.724 --> 38:30.476
<i>Now, listen,</i>
<i>I've never been pepper sprayed in the face,</i>

38:30.559 --> 38:32.478
<i>but there's got to be an argument</i>

38:32.561 --> 38:36.148
<i>that they're being overly dramatic,</i>
<i>that they're playing it up for the cameras.</i>

38:36.232 --> 38:39.360
<i>And that very well may be the fact.</i>
<i>It's just so hard...</i>

38:39.443 --> 38:41.862
- That wasn't a great report.
- It was better than our nothing.

38:41.946 --> 38:45.783
Neal, the incoherence,
the hand signals and the nonsense,

38:45.866 --> 38:47.618
these guys don't make it easy.

38:47.702 --> 38:49.245
I think...

38:49.328 --> 38:51.622
I really feel that by fixating on...

38:51.706 --> 38:53.332
And one of your Occupy idiots

38:53.416 --> 38:57.003
jumped in front of the cab in front of me
in an Uncle Sam costume this morning

38:57.086 --> 38:59.005
and we slammed into a honey wagon.

38:59.088 --> 39:00.881
I walked the other 14 blocks in the rain.

39:00.965 --> 39:03.342
Do you know what happens
to my shoes in the rain?

39:03.426 --> 39:04.885
- Was anyone hurt?
- Yes.

39:04.969 --> 39:07.847
But incredibly,
not the guy in the Uncle Sam costume.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.640
- Mac...
- OWS does nothing for me.

39:09.724 --> 39:13.728
Their disdain for leadership is producing,
surprise, no leaders.

39:13.811 --> 39:15.354
- If that's their worst crime...
- No, it's not.

39:15.438 --> 39:17.773
Their worst crime
is making the Tea Party look good.

39:17.857 --> 39:19.358
How can you say...

39:19.442 --> 39:23.487
I can say that because there are 87 members
of the Tea Party who write laws now

39:23.571 --> 39:25.781
and OWS has a cardboard library.

39:25.865 --> 39:28.200
You think you need to convince me
this is serious?

39:28.284 --> 39:29.744
It is and they're blowing it.

39:29.827 --> 39:31.203
They made themselves the punch line, not us.

39:31.287 --> 39:32.997
- Can't you get past the punch line?
- No.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.458
Well, it probably helps that...

39:35.541 --> 39:37.376
- What?
- Nothing.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.461
Probably helps that what?

39:38.544 --> 39:41.589
That the shoes you walked 14 blocks in
cost $1,200.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.761
- Okay, that was spunky.
- I didn't mean to imply...

39:46.844 --> 39:49.722
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, I did. (CLEARS THROAT)

39:51.640 --> 39:53.476
Here we go, then.

39:54.894 --> 39:59.231
Find me a bright, articulate, informed
representative of the pajama party,

39:59.315 --> 40:03.402
and I will give them five minutes
of national prime time air with Will McAvoy.

40:03.486 --> 40:04.820
You will?

40:04.904 --> 40:08.407
Yes, but you should warn him or her that
he or she is gonna get their limbs torn off.

40:08.491 --> 40:10.034
This was a big one and they fucked it up.

40:10.117 --> 40:11.368
Don't get me a tomato can.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.245
I want him to beat the shit out of
the best they've got.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.705
But he'll be fair?

40:14.789 --> 40:17.333
He's a lot of things, man,

- Sorry about this.

Hey, Zane, Sloan.

It was squeaky and now he's fixed it.

- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah, I would appreciate it

if you would let me produce my show

I don't give Elliot notes behind your back,

- He didn't give me notes.
- You came to me and said Don Keefer agrees.

- He did agree.
- That's giving you notes.

41:48.215 --> 41:50.259
It's my understanding
that Sloan's advice to consumers

41:50.342 --> 41:51.635
was that they'd make money off the stock.

41:51.719 --> 41:54.013
- But that they shouldn't buy it.
- If they have a problem with drones.

41:54.096 --> 41:55.264
Which I thought was good information.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.183
- And that's what he said.
- Yes, but not the only thing I said.

41:57.266 --> 41:58.934
- He did say something else.
- And what was that?

41:59.018 --> 42:01.687
That I have to do what my EP tells me to,
but I thought that was bad advice.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.856
I thought you were one for two on advice,
which ain't bad.

Yeah, I know. You want me to come with you?

I'm pretty sure I was the leak.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.075
Really?

42:56.158 --> 42:57.326
I was supposed to go
to a wedding with a guy,

42:57.409 --> 42:58.744
and I would have been out on the 11th,

42:58.827 --> 43:00.871
and when I found out I was going on,
I told him.

43:00.955 --> 43:03.749
So he knew you were off
before you got the flu.

43:04.959 --> 43:07.002
And it turns out
the guy's Nina Howard's book agent.

43:08.170 --> 43:10.214
You told Nina's book agent?

43:10.297 --> 43:11.632
I didn't know he was her agent at the time.

43:11.715 --> 43:14.426
I knew he was an agent,
but it wasn't until I googled him...

43:14.510 --> 43:16.095
- Why'd you google him?
- You know, after drinks.

43:16.178 --> 43:17.638
- You had drinks?
- This part doesn't matter.

43:17.721 --> 43:19.348
- It matters to me a little.
- Why?

43:19.431 --> 43:20.975
I'm not sure.

43:21.058 --> 43:22.893
- Wait, this is wrong.
- I know.

What do we think
the appropriate punishment should be?

43:24.979 --> 43:27.648
I think certainly
she should be mocked relentlessly.

43:27.731 --> 43:34.238
You said Nina asked you if you took yourself
off voluntarily, or if Reese or Leona did it.

43:35.030 --> 43:37.366
And you told her that I took you off.

43:37.449 --> 43:40.202
And she said
she liked that you told her the truth.

43:40.286 --> 43:41.287
Yeah?

43:41.370 --> 43:43.872
How did she know you were telling the truth?

43:46.667 --> 43:49.837
Did you tell the wedding guy
who took Will off?

43:49.920 --> 43:51.964
No. In fact,
I wouldn't have been able to because...

43:52.047 --> 43:53.674
Because Will told everyone
it was his decision.

We know the questions.
Why aren't we insisting on answers?

49:30.677 --> 49:32.471
Because they want to stay on the bus.

49:32.554 --> 49:33.597
Why?

49:33.680 --> 49:37.476
It's not a press bus. It's a free media bus.

49:37.559 --> 49:40.687
We can get off this bus, rent cars

49:40.771 --> 49:43.899
and cover the campaign
the way a campaign should be covered.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.818

50:52.426 --> 50:54.803
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

50:57.889 --> 51:01.893
- I didn't even know you were still here.
- We're both working late.

51:01.977 --> 51:04.730
Public Affairs at AFRICOM
called before the show.

51:04.813 --> 51:08.066
They feel this is a sensitive time
because of the recent troop deployment,

51:08.150 --> 51:10.152
- and they want to pull your clearance, but...
- God.

51:10.235 --> 51:12.821
- No, listen, Maggie.
- Jesus. Let me blow off some steam,

51:12.904 --> 51:17.200
'cause I didn't say anything
when I got youtubed and Don kicked me out,

51:17.284 --> 51:18.452
or Jim started treating me like a sister,

51:18.535 --> 51:20.579
and Lisa stopped
speaking to me because I had this thing.

51:20.662 --> 51:22.706
I had Africa. I had my first story.

51:22.789 --> 51:24.166
And I've taken these pills,

51:24.249 --> 51:27.252
of which one of the side effects should be
extreme paranoia about the side effects.

51:27.335 --> 51:29.504
Listen to me.
They want to pull your clearance, but...

51:30.630 --> 51:31.631
Oh.

51:32.215 --> 51:33.341
Go on.

51:33.425 --> 51:36.636
I got them to agree to it
if you tack on a human interest story.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.889
The troops do a lot of community outreach.

51:38.972 --> 51:42.434
So you and Gary are going to
an orphanage in north Uganda

51:42.517 --> 51:44.728
that shelters kids
whose parents have been killed in the wars.

51:44.811 --> 51:48.523
The troops will pass out textbooks
and soccer balls and you'll get some film.

51:48.607 --> 51:51.026
- That's great.
- Yeah.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.572
- I'm going.
- You're going.

51:55.655 --> 51:56.823
I'm not gonna make a fool out of you.

51:56.907 --> 51:58.575
I know.

52:01.203 --> 52:03.038
Take this.

52:05.957 --> 52:07.167
$100?

52:07.250 --> 52:09.711
You'd be amazed at the trouble
you can get out of with that.

52:09.795 --> 52:12.005
Okay, but I'll be drawing cash from...

52:12.088 --> 52:13.673
No, it's a tradition.

52:13.757 --> 52:17.469
You either come back with the $100 bill or you
come back with the story of where it went.

52:19.721 --> 52:21.431
Good luck.

52:23.683 --> 52:26.770
That was pretty nice
of Nina Howard to kill the piece.

52:26.853 --> 52:29.356
She is nice. I met her last month.

52:29.439 --> 52:31.399
She said she regretted
a lot of things she'd done.

52:32.067 --> 52:33.985
I should call and thank her.

52:50.126 --> 52:51.503
- NINA: <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

52:51.586 --> 52:55.799
This is your old friend MacKenzie McHale.
I hope I'm not calling too late.

52:55.882 --> 52:59.427
No, no, not at all. It's great to hear from you.

52:59.511 --> 53:01.263
<i>I just wanted to say thanks</i>
<i>for killing the piece.</i>

53:01.346 --> 53:03.014
- I owe you one.
<i>- I hacked your phone.</i>

53:03.098 --> 53:05.100
<i>I think I owe you more than one.</i>

53:05.183 --> 53:08.103
- All right, have a good night.
- You, too.

53:08.186 --> 53:09.771
<i>- Listen.</i>
- Yeah?

53:10.689 --> 53:13.400
- Nothing.
<i>- Okay.</i>

53:13.483 --> 53:14.943
Can I cash in?

53:15.652 --> 53:16.695
I didn't hear that.

53:16.778 --> 53:18.446
On the more than one.

53:21.116 --> 53:22.576
<i>MacKenzie?</i>

53:26.621 --> 53:31.126
Do you happen to remember
the rest of Will's message after he said,

53:31.209 --> 53:34.296
"I'm not just saying this because I'm high"?

53:34.379 --> 53:35.547
<i>I was just curious.</i>

53:35.630 --> 53:41.177
Yeah, no, he said he thought you did
an amazing job with the coverage.

53:41.261 --> 53:43.221
<i>With the bin Laden coverage.</i>

53:43.305 --> 53:44.806
<i>He... I mean,</i>

53:44.890 --> 53:50.896
I don't remember it word for word,
but it was about how you did a great job.

53:50.979 --> 53:54.232
<i>That's really nice. It was a team effort.</i>

53:54.316 --> 53:55.650
I'll bet.

53:55.734 --> 53:58.361
All right. Anyway, thanks again.

53:58.445 --> 54:00.280
<i>Have a good night.</i>

54:16.504 --> 54:18.298
MacKenzie just called me.

54:18.381 --> 54:21.927
- Why?
- To thank me for killing the piece.

54:22.010 --> 54:23.011
(CHUCKLES)

54:26.806 --> 54:29.935
You don't have to look
like you did something wrong.

54:35.732 --> 54:37.943
Jerry's guys are still here working the phones.

54:38.026 --> 54:39.444
They stay late every night.

54:39.527 --> 54:40.862
I think it's time.

54:41.863 --> 54:43.198
Me, too.

54:47.869 --> 54:51.289
Is this the Menendez
that served with MARSOC in 2009?

54:51.373 --> 54:53.124
I'm sorry for calling so late.

54:53.208 --> 54:54.292
Jerry.

54:54.376 --> 54:56.294
I know.

54:56.378 --> 54:58.964
I've got to pull the plug.

54:59.047 --> 55:00.590
It's a true story, Mac.

55:04.552 --> 55:07.263
All right, everybody, thanks anyway.

55:09.724 --> 55:12.519
Happy to be done with this guy.

55:17.649 --> 55:18.650
What's...

55:19.567 --> 55:22.028
It's written phonetically. What's Willie Pete?

55:22.570 --> 55:24.698
- Hmm?
- What's Willie Pete?

55:25.740 --> 55:27.242
It's white phosphorus.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.247
Hamni8. "Willie Pete everywhere. Burning."

55:37.293 --> 55:40.422
Hamni8. "Helicopters, grenades."

55:43.758 --> 55:47.095
Hamni8. "Men in gas masks. Machine guns."

55:51.433 --> 55:53.268
Hamni8. "Burning."

55:56.229 --> 55:59.024
Hamni8. "Americans. White smoke."

56:01.151 --> 56:05.030
Hamni8. "Two helicopters.
No markings on them, but they're American."

56:07.449 --> 56:08.575
This is from the translator.

56:08.658 --> 56:13.538
"I'm translating the next Hamni8 tweet.
It was sent 32 minutes after the last."

56:13.621 --> 56:15.415
Why'd he stop for 32 minutes?

56:15.498 --> 56:17.375
- Jamming.
- What?

56:17.459 --> 56:18.877
Digital frequency hopping.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.463
We'd have jammed the radio
frequencies cell phones use.

56:24.966 --> 56:26.885
He's describing Genoa.
