See anything?

00:35.301 --> 00:37.669
Zombies, the undead...

00:43.511 --> 00:46.245
...Roaming the earth
hunting for brains...

00:49.682 --> 00:51.350
They found us again.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.754
...Long thought of as fictional.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.589
It's you and your damn cigars.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.591
Well, it sure ain't your brains.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.459
Well, they are fictional.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.262
That doesn't mean
we can't test with them, though.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.031
Welcome to the
"Mythbusters Zombie Special."

01:06.033 --> 01:08.267
Say it with me,
"Brains!"

01:08.269 --> 01:10.469
Say it with me,
"Brains."

01:10.471 --> 01:12.037
Brains.
There you go.

01:12.039 --> 01:15.941
The day of the dead has dawned.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.342
Ah!

01:17.344 --> 01:19.178
Assembled for the apocalypse

01:19.180 --> 01:20.913
And joined
by "The Walking Dead's"

01:20.915 --> 01:23.582
Master of mayhem,
Michael Rooker...

01:23.584 --> 01:24.183
I hate zombies.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.520
...The team tackles
a trio of survival tall tales.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.989
Rule number one --
ugh, aim for the head.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.859
First, when faced
with the army of darkness,

01:33.861 --> 01:40.099
Does the axe...
Actually outgun the gun?

01:40.101 --> 01:40.566
Groovy.

01:40.568 --> 01:44.369
Then,
how exactly does an undead horde

01:44.371 --> 01:45.704
Heave down a door?

01:45.706 --> 01:48.006
We're coming for you, old man.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.777
And finally,
can walkers really outpace

01:51.779 --> 01:52.377
The human race?

01:52.379 --> 01:57.316
You do run faster
when zombies are chasing you.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.553
Who are the Mythbusters?

02:02.722 --> 02:03.589
Adam Savage...

02:03.591 --> 02:05.557
70% chance of science.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.259
...And Jamie Hyneman.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.293
Are you done screwing around?

02:08.294 --> 02:13.065
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.667
Together with Tory Belleci...

02:15.669 --> 02:17.336
Let's chop this car up!

02:17.338 --> 02:19.138
...Grant Imahara...

02:19.140 --> 02:20.038
Something just touched me!

02:20.040 --> 02:21.673
...And Kari Byron.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.774
This should be fun.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.011
They don't just tell the myths.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.180
They put them to the test.

02:34.288 --> 02:38.056
Stand by for some facts
with your fiction.

02:38.058 --> 02:41.527
It's "Mythbusters"
versus zombies.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.361
What's up first?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.128
Well, let me ask you.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.563
If you were surrounded
by a zombie horde

02:44.565 --> 02:45.898
And you could choose
only one weapon,

02:45.900 --> 02:50.102
What would you choose --
the gun or axe?

02:50.104 --> 02:50.936
The gun.
Right.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.504
Most people would,
but there's a myth

02:52.506 --> 02:55.073
That the axe is in fact
the better tool.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.408
Really?
Yeah. So what do you say?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.010
You take the gun,
I take the axe.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.144
Let's go find some zombies.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.812
Zombies are fictional.
Right.

03:00.814 --> 03:04.216
Let's go find 100 people
willing to dress as zombies.

03:04.218 --> 03:04.750
Okay.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.685
How hard could that be?

03:06.687 --> 03:09.087
As it turns out,
not hard at all.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.424
"Mythbusters" fans
love getting dressed up.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.927
Now, how exactly
are Adam and Jamie

03:14.929 --> 03:17.329
Going to test
the weapons' lethal efficiency

03:17.331 --> 03:20.832
Without actually
hurting anybody?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.668
As it's Jamie's weapon of choice
is a gun

03:22.670 --> 03:25.871
And the only fictional way
to kill a fictional zombie

03:25.873 --> 03:27.339
Is with a headshot...

03:27.341 --> 03:30.008
...We're going to need
to shoot our zombie volunteers

03:30.010 --> 03:30.609
In the face,

03:30.611 --> 03:33.045
Which means we're going to
have to protect the faces

03:33.047 --> 03:34.046
Of our zombie volunteers.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.649
The answer
is plastic face protectors...

03:37.651 --> 03:39.451
I think this is going to work.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.286
...And paintball guns.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.522
This is going to make my day.

03:43.823 --> 03:44.389
Yep.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.792
It's "shooting Adam in the face"
day.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.427
Bull's-eye!

03:48.429 --> 03:51.096
Jamie hit me
dead between the eyes

03:51.098 --> 03:53.699
While I was wearing
my zombie mask,

03:53.701 --> 03:54.466
And I didn't feel a thing,

03:54.468 --> 03:57.903
Which is exactly what I want
our volunteers to be feeling.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.870
So, now, the prototype works.

03:58.872 --> 04:04.243
It's time to mass-manufacture
at least 100 of these.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.379
All of this work
just so that Jamie Hyneman

04:07.381 --> 04:11.650
Can shoot strangers in the face
for science!

04:12.553 --> 04:16.755
Next, Adam turns
to the myth-preferred method

04:16.757 --> 04:17.589
For wasting walkers.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.992
Now, I'm quite sure
you all agree with me

04:19.994 --> 04:24.162
That the weapon I've chosen
for killing zombies, the axe,

04:24.164 --> 04:25.697
Is far superior to the gun.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.866
But since zombies
don't actually exist

04:27.868 --> 04:30.202
And I won't be able
to drive an actual axe

04:30.204 --> 04:32.037
Through their
ever-loving undead skulls,

04:32.039 --> 04:34.606
I'm going to have to come up
with a safe way

04:34.608 --> 04:36.842
For killing our zombies.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.914
Cue Adam's
clever cushioned cleaver.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.884
It'll leave a safe,
green paint splatter

04:45.886 --> 04:49.421
For every zombie brain
splattered.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.489
Aw. This is awesome.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.959
The paintball paint that I put
in the compartment last night

04:53.961 --> 04:56.194
Has beautifully seeped
through the foam.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.430
Let's see
what kind of mark it makes.

05:00.199 --> 05:02.067
That is the mark
of one dead zombie,

05:02.069 --> 05:03.769
Except
that they're already dead.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.038
Let's just call them
inactive zombies.

05:06.040 --> 05:06.938
Let's get to testing!

05:06.940 --> 05:10.075
And so,
with weapons at the ready...

05:10.077 --> 05:11.777
You'll like this place.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.612
It's nice and creepy.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.882
...The team assembles
at the perfect location

05:16.884 --> 05:20.485
For a spot
of zombie annihilation.

05:20.954 --> 05:26.892
For testing the most efficacious
method for dispatching a zombie,

05:26.894 --> 05:27.859
A gun or an axe,

05:27.861 --> 05:29.628
We've come to one of
our all-time favorite locations.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.464
It's not only a big enough space
for us to really see

05:32.466 --> 05:36.401
And understand what's going on,
it's suitably post-apocalyptic.

05:36.403 --> 05:40.005
I feel like I'm being chased
by a crawling zombie.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.473
Yeah!

05:41.475 --> 05:42.741
Brains!

05:42.743 --> 05:44.209
If I was hiding out
from zombies,

05:44.211 --> 05:47.612
This is exactly the kind
of citadel I would seek out.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.213
Zombies!

05:48.215 --> 05:50.248
That's the arena.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.650
Now, how will it be used?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.752
The methodology here
is pretty straightforward.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.222
I'll be standing in the middle
of a 30-foot-diameter circle

05:57.224 --> 05:58.657
That is the human zone.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.125
Whoa!

06:00.860 --> 06:04.262
The zombies will be
dotted around the building

06:04.264 --> 06:05.931
In their green zombie zone.

06:05.933 --> 06:06.965
Now, when we give the signal,

06:06.967 --> 06:08.734
They will start
their zombie shuffle

06:08.736 --> 06:10.502
Towards the line of demarcation.
Come on!

06:10.504 --> 06:15.040
Now, we can't engage them until
they reach that orange line,

06:15.042 --> 06:17.509
But once they do...

06:18.344 --> 06:20.178
they're all ours.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.482
I don't expect to make it
through all 100 zombies.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.084
The question is
how far will I get.

06:26.086 --> 06:26.551
Brains.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.920
And the rules
will be the same for me,

06:28.922 --> 06:31.723
Except I'm going to be
packing a gun.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.291
Bang.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.026
Brains!

06:36.463 --> 06:39.164
That's the rules
and regulations,

06:39.166 --> 06:40.365
But how about the test subjects?

06:40.367 --> 06:43.135
Now, let's be honest --
zombies are fictional,

06:43.137 --> 06:46.104
Which means every way of dealing
with them is also fictional.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.741
As for how to dispatch them,
we thought we needed an expert,

06:49.743 --> 06:53.111
So where better to go than
the one and only Michael Rooker,

06:53.113 --> 06:55.113
A.K.A. Merle Dixon
from "The Walking Dead."

06:55.115 --> 06:59.151
He is going to show Jamie some
of his preferred methodologies

06:59.153 --> 07:01.586
For dispatching the undead.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.992
Michael, any advice
on taking out zombies?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.760
Well, I noticed you have

07:08.762 --> 07:11.329
A couple of handy-dandy
weapons here.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.266
Well, all we need now
is a zombie, I guess, huh?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.701
Well, we got plenty of those.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.670
Cue the undead man walking.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.238
I see.
Well, thank you.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.575
If they're approaching,
you just pop them in the knee.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.310
Bang!

07:25.813 --> 07:27.646
If they're still approaching...

07:27.648 --> 07:29.347
Pop them in the other knee.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.715
Bang!

07:31.251 --> 07:33.685
Of course,
they are kind of hungry...

07:33.687 --> 07:35.353
And they're a little --
okay.

07:35.355 --> 07:38.790
Usually I grab them
and hold them down like that,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.759
And I pop them in the head.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.893
Bang!

07:41.895 --> 07:43.528
Nice.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.564
Phew! That's one down.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.600
But to test which weapon
is the most efficient

07:48.602 --> 07:52.838
To deal with zombies en masse,
we need a horde.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.941
That is an awesome view.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.843
And for experimental accuracy,

07:57.845 --> 08:00.979
They need to know
exactly how to move.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.014
Good morning, zombies.

08:03.016 --> 08:03.915
Morning!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.150
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.786
Like zombies!
Good morning, zombies.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.957
You might recognize
this gentleman to my right,

08:11.959 --> 08:13.859
Michael Rooker
from "The Walking Dead."

08:14.394 --> 08:18.263
Now, Michael is going to
give you guys a lesson

08:18.265 --> 08:19.331
In the zombie shuffle.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.066
Using all
his "Walking Dead" experience,

08:21.068 --> 08:25.704
Michael coaches the volunteers
on zombie behavior --

08:25.706 --> 08:30.475
An unintelligent,
slow shuffle towards food...

08:30.477 --> 08:31.443
Much better.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.943
...With a unique twist.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.945
That's good.
Cut.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.480
Okay. Very good.
You're scary.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.316
And everybody, you got to
develop your own walk.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.785
He's an individual zombie,
you're all individual zombies.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.256
You're not
cookie-cutter zombies.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.123
Develop your own deal.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.893
With the demonstration complete,
school's out...

08:47.895 --> 08:51.496
All right,
commence zombie shuffle now!

08:51.498 --> 08:53.765
...And the terror begins.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.034
That is positively terrifying.

08:56.036 --> 08:56.401
Yeah!

08:56.403 --> 08:58.603
I'm happy they're not trying
to eat me right now.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.271
Me, too.

08:59.273 --> 09:03.909
And with the horrifyingly
realistic horde assembled...

09:03.911 --> 09:06.011
Listen to that sound.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.381
...It's time to get
down to experimental business.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.617
All right.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.286
Zombies, are you ready?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.023
Adam, are you ready?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.558
I'm ready, sir!

09:19.560 --> 09:20.559
All right.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.828
Three, two, one.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.269
Ah!

09:33.506 --> 09:34.706
Ah!

09:34.708 --> 09:36.508
Ah!

09:36.510 --> 09:38.443
Ah!

09:38.445 --> 09:39.744
Gah! Dead!

09:39.746 --> 09:40.712
Dead!

09:40.714 --> 09:41.980
Dead! Dead!

09:41.982 --> 09:44.482
Ah! I've been killed.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.087
You're zombie meat, brother.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.123
I don't think
I killed more than 20.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.291
I'll count.

09:53.293 --> 09:57.395
One, two, three, four, five...

09:57.397 --> 10:00.031
11, 12, 13.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.000
13. That's it?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.501
That's not many.

10:03.503 --> 10:03.902
Ah!

10:03.904 --> 10:06.037
Even though I only killed 13
in that test,

10:06.039 --> 10:08.940
I'm still feeling really good
about the axe

10:08.942 --> 10:10.408
As the weapon of choice.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.443
Dead! Dead!

10:11.445 --> 10:12.811
I just feel that I can reload

10:12.813 --> 10:16.114
Faster than Jamie
will be able to with a gun.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.449
Ah! I've been killed.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.185
Just to make sure that
that test was accurate,

10:20.187 --> 10:22.787
I'm going to have the zombies
brought out again.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.722
I'm going to try a second time

10:23.724 --> 10:26.858
So we can average my results
across both tests.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.592
All right.

10:27.594 --> 10:32.764
Zombies attack
in three, two, one.

10:33.667 --> 10:38.103
Will Adam be able to
use his knowledge from test one

10:38.105 --> 10:40.071
To improve his zombie count?

10:40.907 --> 10:41.806
He's a blur of action,

10:41.808 --> 10:46.411
Holding off his creeping,
moaning and shuffling attackers

10:46.413 --> 10:47.045
As long as he can.

10:47.047 --> 10:51.282
But, as before,
by sheer weight of numbers,

10:51.284 --> 10:54.653
The encroaching
slow-motion zombie tsunami

10:54.655 --> 10:58.189
Overwhelms
our axe-wielding hero.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.060
I think I got further this time.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.662
I think I killed more.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.764
He did, but just barely.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.298
I got 15.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.534
I got 15, as well.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.235
15 it is.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.672
Which is an average kill count
of 14

11:13.674 --> 11:15.173
And good, consistent data.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.843
But will it outgun the gun?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.578
Up next is the Hyneman.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.548
I just want to get warmed up.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.418
And he means business --

11:26.420 --> 11:28.920
Zombie-killing business.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.356
Groovy.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.657
Coming up on "Mythbusters,"

11:32.659 --> 11:37.362
We see if you can outrun
a horde of zombies.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.674
Up next, can the walking dead,

11:49.676 --> 11:53.545
really catch the running living?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.824
In every zombie movie,
there is that scene

12:05.826 --> 12:07.892
Where the horde
descends on somebody

12:07.894 --> 12:09.394
And just tears them to shreds.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.330
And that is the myth
that we are going to be testing.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.832
Can you escape
the zombie horde?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.569
Okay, this is one thing
that I've always wondered about

12:17.571 --> 12:18.269
Because traditionally,

12:18.271 --> 12:21.306
Don't they just shuffle
at like two miles an hour?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.975
And it feels like
you can just outrun them.

12:23.977 --> 12:24.609
Well, yeah, sure.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.511
Maybe you could outrun one
or two no problem,

12:26.513 --> 12:29.581
But what zombie apocalypse
only has a couple zombies?

12:29.583 --> 12:30.715
Okay, I see what you're saying.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.151
It's a numbers game,
and that's what we're testing.

12:33.153 --> 12:33.618
Exactly.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.521
This is going to be
the best myth ever.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.793
The zombie horde
has their undead eyes

12:41.795 --> 12:42.460
On the living prize.

12:42.462 --> 12:47.098
But, despite shuffling at the
speed at a decomposing corpse,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.367
The result
is somehow inevitable.

12:49.369 --> 12:54.072
The unarmed, fleet-footed humans
always get caught,

12:54.074 --> 12:55.640
And it's a brain buffet.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.977
How do you guys
want to test this myth?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.678
All right, well,
let's set up an area,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.380
Say, the size
of a football field,

13:02.382 --> 13:03.815
And then get a zombie horde.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.251
We'll see if we could
run through it and escape them.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.086
All right, well,
that means we need some zombies,

13:08.088 --> 13:10.922
And we need to figure out
how they're supposed to behave.

13:10.924 --> 13:14.025
Well, I know the perfect person
who's an expert on zombies.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.227
He could tell us
what they can and can't do,

13:16.229 --> 13:19.531
And he'll help us set up
the parameters for our myth.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.331
Sounds good.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.402
So, the team will
stage the apocalyptic olympics.

13:24.404 --> 13:29.307
It's humans versus the horde
in a race for survival.

13:30.544 --> 13:34.312
But, first up, Tory's meeting
one of his hollywood heroes,

13:34.314 --> 13:37.982
Legend of the undead
Greg Nicotero.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.019
In order for us to test
these zombie myths accurately,

13:41.021 --> 13:42.253
We need
to get some more information.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.523
So, we're here at KNB Studios,
a special-effects house.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.726
They are responsible
for pretty much every zombie

13:48.728 --> 13:50.895
You've ever seen
in any horror movie,

13:50.897 --> 13:53.097
Not to mention the show
"Walking Dead."

13:53.099 --> 13:55.633
So, we're going to go talk
to Greg Nicotero right now,

13:55.635 --> 13:57.468
Who is pretty much
the king of zombies,

13:57.470 --> 14:00.271
And get
a little bit more information.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.707
We need some zombie data
to test our myth.

14:02.709 --> 14:06.277
We just need to know
a little bit more about zombies

14:06.279 --> 14:08.479
And what they can and can't do.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.082
We used the scene
in "Night of Living Dead"

14:11.084 --> 14:17.355
In the cemetery as our sort of
holy grail for zombie movement.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.724
They're not very quick.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.125
They're attracted to sound.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.662
I think sometimes they're
attracted to light or dark.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.763
I don't think
they're very smart.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.533
Generally speaking,
you just got to make sure

14:28.535 --> 14:30.501
That you don't get overrun
by too many of them.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.872
So, armed with the experimental

14:33.874 --> 14:34.873
Rules of engagement...

14:34.875 --> 14:37.508
All right, zombie apocalypse.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.176
We're almost there.

14:38.178 --> 14:42.013
...The team assembles
at apocalypse ground zero.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.250
Need my zombie-killing hat.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.452
We are here
at the Alameda runway

14:47.454 --> 14:50.989
To test the myth that
you can't outrun a zombie horde.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.324
Now, the way
we're going to test this

14:53.326 --> 14:55.360
Is we're going to create
a part of a city

14:55.362 --> 14:58.596
That has been overrun
by the zombie apocalypse.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.432
Now all we need
is a zombie horde.

15:08.374 --> 15:12.477
So we have 150 volunteers
for our zombie horde.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.280
Oh, my God!

15:15.282 --> 15:18.182
Here comes the horde.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.685
Now, for us,
that is the perfect number

15:20.687 --> 15:24.022
Because in our designated area,
all of those volunteers

15:24.024 --> 15:26.824
Represent a population density
of Manhattan.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.093
That's 90,000 people
per square mile.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.663
We're going to
scatter them around the field

15:31.665 --> 15:33.665
And try and run
from one end to the other.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.601
We'll be wearing
these mini brains on our backs.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.636
If they manage
to grab one of these,

15:38.638 --> 15:41.639
That means that
we haven't escaped the horde.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.174
It means that we've been eaten.

15:43.176 --> 15:47.145
So, now, it's time
to bring on the zombies.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.289
This is freaking me out.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.258
I don't like this at all.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.698
Wow.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.566
This is terrifying.

16:12.839 --> 16:16.607
Well, they asked
for a zombie horde.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.242
Now, some ground rules.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.478
Welcome, zombie horde!

16:22.716 --> 16:28.553
Rule number one -- zombies
can only move at a slow shuffle.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.458
Rule number two --
your brains are infected,

16:33.460 --> 16:36.060
So you have
no rational thought.

16:36.963 --> 16:42.100
Rule number three --
this is your target.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.101
Brains!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.472
Let the brains begin!

16:48.475 --> 16:50.541
With a code of conduct

16:50.543 --> 16:53.311
Established
for consistent data...

16:53.880 --> 16:56.147
I don't want
to do this anymore.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.849
...The animated deceased

16:57.851 --> 17:01.152
Disperse randomly
over the experimental space...

17:01.821 --> 17:04.454
...A field of play
100 yards long

17:04.457 --> 17:08.425
And 55 yards wide
that our humans have to cross

17:08.428 --> 17:11.695
While keeping
their brains intact.

17:12.232 --> 17:16.467
And first up to race
for the human race is Kari.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.069
I have to say,
I'm kind of nervous.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.304
First of all,
that girl right there

17:20.306 --> 17:23.074
Looks like
she's actually going to eat me.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.042
I don't know
if I'm going to make it through.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.346
It looked a lot easier
before the zombies showed up.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.180
All right. Let's go.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.516
So with Grant and Tory observing

17:31.518 --> 17:37.121
From a safe, overhead distance,
let the games begin.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.226
There she goes.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.897
At the heart of
this brain game are the numbers.

17:45.899 --> 17:50.468
It's one human
versus a zombie horde of 150.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.636
Ah!
Oh, my God.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.303
That is terrifying.

17:52.305 --> 17:56.641
And Kari is dodging
and weaving at 10 miles an hour,

17:56.643 --> 18:00.344
While the walkers
can only chase at two.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.380
She's looking good.
She's going to make it.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.214
Ah!
No way.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.882
Yeah, she's going to make it.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.350
Come on. Come on.
Oh!

18:06.352 --> 18:08.686
And those numbers...

18:08.688 --> 18:09.887
Yeah!
She made it!

18:09.889 --> 18:13.658
...Add up to Kari's survival.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.559
Yeah!

18:15.261 --> 18:20.498
You do run faster
when zombies are chasing you.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.766
Ah!

18:21.768 --> 18:24.102
Kari survived
the zombie horde no problem.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.637
But, you know what,
the next thing we're going to do

18:26.639 --> 18:30.575
Is increase
the population density by 50%.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.976
And this time, it's Tory's turn.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.780
So the field of play
is reduced in size...

18:35.782 --> 18:37.281
All right.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.216
25 yards in.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.885
...Meaning
the zombie density is increased

18:40.887 --> 18:43.888
To 135,000 people
per square mile,

18:43.890 --> 18:49.293
Matching parts of the massive
Indian megacity Mumbai.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.264
I hope you like Italian food!

18:55.168 --> 18:55.633
Oh, boy.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.403
The apocalypse has
reached epidemic proportions.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.838
You guys ready?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.140
Ready when you are.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.042
Run, Tory, run!

19:05.044 --> 19:06.244
Whoo!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.645
Oh-ho.
Dodge.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.913
Weave.
Good job!

19:08.915 --> 19:12.650
The zombies
are clearly more densely packed.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.753
But Tory,
reliving a twisted version

19:15.755 --> 19:18.189
Of his high-school
football dreams,

19:18.191 --> 19:20.124
Makes it to the end zone safely.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.126
Oh, my God.
He made it!

19:22.128 --> 19:23.761
He made it!
Yes!

19:23.763 --> 19:25.496
Do I have all my brains?

19:25.498 --> 19:25.897
Yes.

19:25.899 --> 19:30.768
So I made it through the zombie
horde with all my brains intact,

19:30.770 --> 19:32.036
And it was insane!

19:32.038 --> 19:33.771
The adrenaline was flowing.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.873
The zombies
were trying to eat me,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.543
But I made it through.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.978
But now
we're going to do it again.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.946
This time, we're going to

19:41.948 --> 19:44.415
Increase the population density
even more.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.185
This time,
Grant's going to go for it.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.255
Yep.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.926
The myth that you can't elude
a legion of living dead

19:54.928 --> 19:57.328
Is looking deceased.

19:57.330 --> 19:57.828
Ah! Quick!

19:57.830 --> 20:02.033
But there's one more
host to offer the horde

20:02.035 --> 20:04.602
And one variable
to adjust -- density.

20:04.604 --> 20:08.606
So what we're going to
do next is increase that

20:08.608 --> 20:11.609
To 180,000 people
per square mile,

20:11.611 --> 20:17.415
Which is the most densely
populated area in the world.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.552
And I'm up next.

20:21.554 --> 20:25.022
Coming up next
on "Mythbusters"...

20:25.024 --> 20:25.923
Help!

20:37.869 --> 20:38.769
Hi, everybody.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.670
This is Michael Rooker,

20:39.672 --> 20:44.408
And welcome back to the
"Mythbusters Zombie Special."

20:48.046 --> 20:48.846
I hate zombies.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.549
Well,
he's come to the right place

20:51.551 --> 20:54.218
Because Adam and Jamie
are testing the myth

20:54.220 --> 20:56.621
That when it comes
to wasting walkers...

20:56.623 --> 20:57.888
Dead! Dead!

20:57.890 --> 20:59.423
...Axe trumps gun.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.893
I have already confronted
a zombie horde with an axe,

21:02.895 --> 21:06.664
And I was able to down 14
of their undead brethren

21:06.666 --> 21:08.099
Before they got to my brains.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.801
Now it's Jamie's turn
to do the same with a gun

21:10.803 --> 21:11.969
And see if he can do any better.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.006
Well, our zombies
are all properly protected.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.508
You ready to shoot some
in the face?

21:17.510 --> 21:18.909
Bring it on.
Okay.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.378
Good luck.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.246
I hope you get more than 14.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.116
It's time to find out.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.521
Jamie
and his single-action handgun

21:30.523 --> 21:34.191
Versus a legion
of brain-eating zombies.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.629
And...

21:38.631 --> 21:42.900
The legion
of brain-eating zombies wins...

21:42.902 --> 21:44.201
Help!

21:44.203 --> 21:45.436
...Convincingly.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.439
So, Hyneman score --
25 seconds...

21:48.441 --> 21:51.375
Six zombies.
Not a very good score.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.711
Mnh-mnh.
Sad.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.180
That was really stunning
to watch.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.348
I can tell you from experience,

21:57.350 --> 21:58.249
It's creepy to be in there

21:58.251 --> 22:00.284
While everyone
is shambling towards you,

22:00.286 --> 22:03.020
And he's doing this kind of
looking back and forth.

22:03.022 --> 22:03.654
It's real tension.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.590
And then all of a sudden,
like four seconds later,

22:06.592 --> 22:08.626
The entire circle
is full of zombies

22:08.628 --> 22:09.493
And the Hyneman went down.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.895
Now, he's going to go
for a second run,

22:10.897 --> 22:13.631
And he's going to be a little
more prepared for this one.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.466
I can't wait
to see what he comes up with.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.836
What he comes up with
are more guns,

22:18.838 --> 22:20.905
More ammo, and more style.

22:20.907 --> 22:24.608
This time, I'm loaded for bear.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.078
I've got two on the legs,
two on the waist,

22:27.080 --> 22:29.513
Two on the shoulders,
one in the hand.

22:29.515 --> 22:33.751
I've got 2 bullets for every one
of these 100 zombies.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.287
I'm ready as I'll ever be.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.791
Guns versus zombie.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.560
Three, two, one.

22:43.896 --> 22:47.631
This time, Jamie has
a pump-action paintball rifle

22:47.633 --> 22:49.600
That he can reload much faster.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.668
And he starts well,

22:50.670 --> 22:53.270
Working his way
through the walkers

22:53.272 --> 22:57.108
Much more efficiently
than his first test.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.876
Six. Seven. Eight.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.213
But it's still
not nearly quick enough.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.818
I was trying to build
a wall of zombies around me

23:07.820 --> 23:10.788
So that I could keep these guys
away from me,

23:10.790 --> 23:11.722
But I tripped on one

23:11.724 --> 23:13.391
And then
I'm into the soup again.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.793
And I still only got --
what is this, eight?

23:15.795 --> 23:16.861
Yeah, eight.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.263
That's how many shots
I can get off

23:19.265 --> 23:20.331
Before they're on me.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.766
Well, that's a result!

23:22.268 --> 23:25.302
And the result
couldn't be clearer.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.872
Compared to a mobile,
axe-wielding Adam,

23:27.874 --> 23:32.943
It takes Jamie too long
to reload, steady, take aim,

23:32.945 --> 23:34.879
And take out the walkers.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.080
The numbers don't lie.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.382
So, what do you think?
What's the final tally?

23:38.384 --> 23:40.885
Well, my average
was just over seven kills.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.453
Mine was 14 kills.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.888
Double.
Double.

23:43.890 --> 23:44.388
Axe wins.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.824
At least with single-action
or pump shotgun.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.926
Sure.
Well, that settles it.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.194
Yeah.
Axe wins.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.061
Bladed weapons rule.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.696
And with the axe confirmed

23:52.698 --> 23:55.866
As the apocalyptic weapon
of choice...

23:55.868 --> 23:57.802
This is their reward
for the hard work.

23:57.804 --> 23:58.869
Zombies!

23:58.871 --> 24:01.906
Brains!
...It's chow time.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.091
Filmic folklore suggests

24:21.093 --> 24:25.229
That despite an average speed
of just two miles an hour,

24:25.231 --> 24:29.700
The zombie horde
always gets its prey.

24:30.369 --> 24:34.972
But with Kari and Tory
already successful

24:34.974 --> 24:37.007
In evading the zombie shuffle,

24:37.009 --> 24:41.579
It's Grant's turn to try
and keep his brains intact.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.146
They look hungry.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.815
He's facing
the highest population density

24:44.817 --> 24:50.955
On the planet, an incredible
180,000 people per square mile.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.693
It's the worst-case
urban-apocalypse scenario

24:55.695 --> 25:00.464
And the last chance
for the myth.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.203
But he just can't
make it through.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.973
Ah! No! Ah!

25:08.975 --> 25:13.878
One mistake
and he's down and swarmed.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.180
There's too many!

25:17.483 --> 25:19.216
So Kari succeeded
in outrunning a horde

25:19.218 --> 25:21.318
That was the population density
of Manhattan.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.889
Tory succeeded at a slightly
higher population density

25:24.891 --> 25:27.391
Of 135,000 people
per square mile.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.961
Unfortunately,
when we got that density up

25:30.963 --> 25:33.764
To 180,000 people
per square mile,

25:33.766 --> 25:35.299
That's where it all fell apart,

25:35.301 --> 25:37.334
And I could not
escape the horde.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.502
When the horde

25:38.504 --> 25:40.204
Is in a tightly packed
urban environment,

25:40.206 --> 25:43.574
It doesn't matter
that they're slow.

25:44.143 --> 25:49.246
So with the myth
back in the balance, what next?

25:49.248 --> 25:51.682
We're going to try
to come up with other tactics

25:51.684 --> 25:56.120
To try to trick the zombie horde
and see if we can escape.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.189
So day two of the dead dawns,

25:59.191 --> 26:01.859
And the team
once again rendezvous

26:01.861 --> 26:04.795
In an attempt
to outrun the apocalypse.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.098
And this time,
they're each packing a plan.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.967
After all, when the end is nigh,

26:09.969 --> 26:13.537
A good survival strategy
is essential.

26:14.941 --> 26:15.673
All right, Kari.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.674
What's your technique,
duct tape?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.842
How's that going to save you
from a zombie horde?

26:18.844 --> 26:20.978
I was thinking maybe
like a limp or something.

26:20.980 --> 26:21.812
Oh, that's good.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.481
But then I thought that
this would be so much better.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.016
What the...?

26:26.953 --> 26:30.754
Wait, what is this technique?

26:30.756 --> 26:31.555
No!

26:31.557 --> 26:34.558
Hey, zombies!

26:34.560 --> 26:36.794
Zombie food!

26:36.796 --> 26:37.261
No! No!

26:37.263 --> 26:40.998
It's a classic bait and switch,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.534
The type of tactic
Merle might deploy.

26:43.536 --> 26:48.038
With the horde distracted
by a free meal on wheels...

26:48.908 --> 26:52.242
Kari, you son of a...!

26:52.244 --> 26:55.379
...Kari makes a run for it

26:55.381 --> 26:58.582
And makes it to the end zone
and freedom.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.117
Ah!

27:00.119 --> 27:02.252
I live!

27:02.254 --> 27:05.656
Her cynical use
of collateral damage...

27:05.658 --> 27:08.258
Thanks a lot, Kari.
Way to throw me under the bus.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.462
...Means she bought
herself enough time

27:11.464 --> 27:12.529
To avoid being lobotomized.

27:12.531 --> 27:18.102
Zombie apocalypse, the rules
of friendship do not apply.

27:18.104 --> 27:18.502
Yep.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.505
If you have an enemy
or coworker to sacrifice,

27:21.507 --> 27:24.675
Escaping the horde
may be possible.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.678
Coming up on "Mythbusters,"

27:27.680 --> 27:31.749
Can anything
stop a zombie horde?

27:37.822 --> 27:39.490
Remember, kids,
don't try anything

27:39.492 --> 27:40.824
You're about to see at home.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.226
That's right.
We're experts.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.427
And why are we experts?

27:43.429 --> 27:47.031
Brains!
That's right.

27:49.601 --> 27:55.372
Up next, it's
the might of the living dead.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.407
What's up next?

27:56.409 --> 27:57.374
Zombie teamwork.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.842
Zombies don't do teamwork.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.210
They're dead stupid.
Right.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.513
Zombies don't <i>talk</i> to each other
to do teamwork.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.114
But they do all have
a common instinct,

28:04.116 --> 28:05.883
And that means
they often work together.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.351
You see it in zombie movies
all the time.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.753
Our heroes are barricaded
behind some kind of big door,

28:09.755 --> 28:12.856
And the zombies know that there
are brains behind that door.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.158
And they all gather up.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.027
And they're pushing at the door,
and they're pushing at the door.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.563
And eventually, through the
force of all of their bodies,

28:19.565 --> 28:21.265
They break the door down.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.534
So, what you're saying
is sort of like

28:23.536 --> 28:25.536
Many dead hands
make for light work.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.638
Many <i>undead</i> hands
make for light work,

28:27.640 --> 28:29.873
And I think
we should test that.

28:29.875 --> 28:30.240
Sure.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.443
It's a classic
living-dead cliché.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.912
Dinner's on the far side
of a door,

28:34.914 --> 28:38.549
A barrier hastily barred
by the desperate living,

28:38.551 --> 28:41.085
And yet
the uncoordinated efforts

28:41.087 --> 28:43.487
Of a zombie horde
somehow combine

28:43.489 --> 28:46.023
To successfully
bust down the door.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.126
Question is
does a mob really rule,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.762
Or is this
physical-force fiction?

28:51.764 --> 28:57.468
To find out, Adam and Jamie head
for a suitably remote location

28:57.470 --> 28:59.503
To test humanity's last stand

28:59.505 --> 29:02.706
Against
the approaching apocalypse.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.109
Look at that.

29:05.111 --> 29:09.012
The barn I'm standing
in front of is 153 years old.

29:09.014 --> 29:09.580
That's right.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.782
It was built
when Jamie was but a wee lad,

29:11.784 --> 29:14.318
And this door
is the line of engagement

29:14.320 --> 29:15.519
Between us and the zombies.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.988
It's where we will have
our last stand.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.256
There we go.
Perfect.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.259
Now, we don't want to hurt any
part of this beautiful artifact,

29:22.261 --> 29:24.461
So we're not actually going to
use their door,

29:24.463 --> 29:25.662
And we're not even going to use
their barn.

29:25.664 --> 29:28.499
We're gonna build a steel frame
within this doorframe

29:28.501 --> 29:34.605
That we will attach our doors to
for proper zombie testing.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.806
Stylish doors.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.174
They look great.

29:37.176 --> 29:37.975
Bring out your dead!

29:37.977 --> 29:42.746
Speaking of dead,
Adam will be joining team Zed,

29:42.748 --> 29:44.515
But he doesn't want
to actually die.

29:44.517 --> 29:48.418
So in an experiment designed
to test the forces of a crowd

29:48.420 --> 29:51.855
Crushing up
against a securely bolted door,

29:51.857 --> 29:54.291
Serious safety measures
are required.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.826
If you take 100 people

29:55.828 --> 29:58.462
And have them pushing
against an immovable object,

29:58.464 --> 30:01.799
And if each one of them
is able to exert something like

30:01.801 --> 30:02.599
50 pounds of push,

30:02.601 --> 30:05.469
That totals
about 5,000 pounds of pressure.

30:05.471 --> 30:10.407
So with that in mind, we've come
up with this as a solution.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.142
Belly bump.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.180
These are polyethylene
corrugated sewer pipes.

30:16.182 --> 30:19.316
Now, you may recall seeing them
first on "Mythbusters"

30:19.318 --> 30:23.387
In "Raccoon Rocket," where
we used them as cannon barrels.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.154
Oh, my God!

30:24.156 --> 30:27.424
They're light
and they're super strong,

30:27.426 --> 30:29.893
And they should do the trick.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.996
Meanwhile,
Adam's been bitten and turned.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.667
Or he's had
an extreme undead makeover.

30:36.669 --> 30:40.470
Joining Jamie
for the "Z"-day door duel...

30:40.472 --> 30:41.338
I hate zombies.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.007
...Is Michael Rooker...

30:44.009 --> 30:46.343
Come on!
You want some of this?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.412
Come and get it!

30:48.414 --> 30:49.713
...Who seems to have reverted

30:49.715 --> 30:53.350
To his "Walking Dead" character,
Merle Dixon.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.017
Come on!

30:54.019 --> 30:56.620
Come on!

30:56.622 --> 30:57.855
This is it.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.158
Will the individuals' random
50-pound push force

31:01.160 --> 31:04.494
Somehow combine at
a coordinated point of pressure?

31:04.496 --> 31:08.732
And will that be enough to
break the barn door cross brace?

31:08.734 --> 31:10.734
Maybe we better back up
a little bit.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.736
I think that's a good idea.

31:12.738 --> 31:13.704
Oh-ho!

31:20.111 --> 31:21.378
This is not good!

31:21.380 --> 31:23.080
This is not good!

31:23.082 --> 31:25.983
What do we do now, Jamie?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.085
I never even slowed down.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.320
You're going to need
a stronger door.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.190
Is everybody okay?

31:34.927 --> 31:36.693
Told you I hated zombies.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.830
Went right through that door,
no effort at all.

31:39.832 --> 31:42.799
Being on the zombie side of the
equation for this experiment,

31:42.801 --> 31:46.503
Fantastic because I'm choosing
a side in this battle,

31:46.505 --> 31:47.804
But it's not with the living.

31:47.806 --> 31:51.308
I reached that door with
my zombie brethren behind me,

31:51.310 --> 31:54.177
And I don't think
I actually even broke stride.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.280
I touched the door,
zombies touched me,

31:56.282 --> 32:00.517
And "whoomp," we were through,
and we were headed for Jamie.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.151
That was stunning.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.421
Can't wait to see
what a stronger door gives us

32:04.423 --> 32:06.456
In terms of a challenge.

32:09.861 --> 32:13.096
With a mixed body bag
of results...

32:13.832 --> 32:15.565
...The myth that outrunning

32:15.567 --> 32:19.670
Rather than outgunning
a zombie horde is up for grabs.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.837
Zombie food!

32:20.839 --> 32:25.976
Kari managed to distract with
a decoy, but up next is Grant.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.945
And as you might expect,
he came prepared.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.013
Are you going to be inside this?

32:30.015 --> 32:33.216
No.
My double will.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.718
As far as he's concerned,

32:34.720 --> 32:37.120
When it comes
to evading the apocalypse,

32:37.122 --> 32:39.156
Robots are the answer.

32:39.158 --> 32:42.259
So this is
my zombie-distraction technique.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.360
Now, yes,
it's going to employ distraction

32:43.362 --> 32:46.229
Just like the others,
but it's a little bit different.

32:46.231 --> 32:49.266
This is a robot
that has light and sound.

32:49.268 --> 32:53.670
And it's going to have
a mannequin that looks like me.

32:53.672 --> 32:58.909
So, Grant has
a very complex strategy here.

32:58.911 --> 33:02.612
When I'm ready to deploy,
I'll turn on the lights,

33:02.614 --> 33:03.246
Turn on the sound.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.315
It's going to scream
just like me.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.650
It's going to look just like me.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.953
And it's going to draw
all the zombies over there,

33:09.955 --> 33:12.756
And I'll run the other way.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.958
<i>Hello, zombies!</i>

33:14.960 --> 33:16.426
<i>Here I am.</i>

33:16.428 --> 33:18.095
<i>Come and get me!</i>

33:18.097 --> 33:21.498
<i>My brain</i>
<i>is juicy and delicious.</i>

33:21.500 --> 33:23.066
And Grant plays it perfectly,

33:23.068 --> 33:26.803
Waiting until all the zombies
within hearing distance

33:26.805 --> 33:28.171
Are sucked in...

33:28.173 --> 33:29.573
<i>And delicious.</i>

33:29.575 --> 33:30.440
<i>Come and get me.</i>

33:30.442 --> 33:33.710
...So that when he finally
makes a run for it,

33:33.712 --> 33:36.780
He has a clear path to freedom.

33:38.050 --> 33:41.251
Yeah! I made it!

33:41.253 --> 33:43.053
Whoo! Ah!

33:43.055 --> 33:46.156
The first day,
Grant didn't quite make it,

33:46.158 --> 33:48.892
So he had more motivation
than any of us

33:48.894 --> 33:50.827
To make this distraction work.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.497
And it worked really,
really well.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.733
<i>My brain</i>
<i>is juicy and delicious.</i>

33:56.735 --> 33:59.169
<i>Come and get me.</i>

33:59.171 --> 34:00.337
He did it Grant style.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.573
He pulled out a robot with
lights and noise and yelling.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.343
All of the zombies
horded in on it,

34:06.345 --> 34:11.047
And Grant could sneak around
the side and get to freedom.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.216
Yeah!
I made it!

34:13.217 --> 34:15.518
So it's Tory's turn.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.188
And back
when he visited Greg Nicotero,

34:18.190 --> 34:21.958
He had a zombie
makeover master class...

34:21.960 --> 34:24.494
It looks like you're done.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.563
...That gave him the idea

34:27.565 --> 34:30.567
For his deceitful
distraction technique.

34:31.937 --> 34:36.005
Let's see
if I can blend in with them.

34:38.775 --> 34:39.342
Yep.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.411
Tory is attempting
to hide in plain sight.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.815
Before the zombies dispersed,
he hid in one of the car wrecks.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.321
Now he has to get back
to the start line

34:51.322 --> 34:54.157
Before completing
his lap of the field.

34:54.693 --> 34:59.796
Will the volunteers recognize
the human dressed as a zombie?

34:59.798 --> 35:04.968
Will his bloody, decomposing
disguise stand up to scrutiny?

35:04.970 --> 35:08.939
Tory's made it
all the way here.

35:08.941 --> 35:09.306
What?

35:09.308 --> 35:11.908
He's made it all the way here,
and is --

35:11.910 --> 35:14.244
Where?
He's heading back.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.115
But halfway
to the finish line...

35:23.321 --> 35:25.455
...He's discovered.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.628
Whoa!

35:31.630 --> 35:33.530
Oh! No!

35:36.268 --> 35:37.601
I'm dead!

35:39.671 --> 35:40.804
Back!

35:40.806 --> 35:41.638
Back!

35:41.640 --> 35:42.939
Back!
Back!

35:42.941 --> 35:45.041
Back, zombies!
Fire!

35:45.043 --> 35:46.309
Back!
Fire!

35:46.311 --> 35:48.211
Back!
Oh, my God.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.479
Oh!

35:49.481 --> 35:51.815
Well, it kind of worked
at first.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.351
I mean, I was able
to sneak through the horde,

35:54.353 --> 35:57.354
But then at one point,
a zombie recognized me,

35:57.356 --> 35:58.855
And then it was all over.

35:58.857 --> 35:59.890
They were all on to me.

35:59.892 --> 36:02.792
But it doesn't matter
because as long as one of us

36:02.794 --> 36:04.661
Made it through
in one experiment,

36:04.663 --> 36:07.497
That means it works
and it's it busted.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.265
That's right.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.666
Distraction is a technique

36:09.668 --> 36:12.035
That allows you
to escape the horde.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.870
This myth is busted.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.539
Totally busted.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.279
Busted,
and you could say the team

36:22.281 --> 36:23.947
Is, uh, thriller-ed
with the result.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.951
When I first heard that we
were going to test zombie myths,

36:27.953 --> 36:28.618
I had two reactions.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.888
One was, "Oh, my God.
This is the best day ever."

36:31.890 --> 36:33.290
But then, my next reaction was,

36:33.292 --> 36:36.159
"How are we going to
test this scientifically?"

36:36.161 --> 36:38.995
But we actually came away
with some results.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.363
Now, it was difficult,

36:40.365 --> 36:43.767
And the more condensed they got,
the harder it became

36:43.769 --> 36:44.434
Until it was impossible.

36:44.436 --> 36:49.172
However, Grant did figure out
a way to distract the horde

36:49.174 --> 36:52.042
In order to escape,
so it's busted.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.545
This is the most fun I've had
in so long.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.498
What is a zombie?

37:15.500 --> 37:19.970
A zombie is a mindless,
reanimated corpse

37:19.972 --> 37:23.139
With the hunger for human flesh.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.107
How to kill a zombie --

37:24.109 --> 37:27.711
You cannot kill a zombie,
for they are already dead.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.814
But you can stop them
by destroying the brain.

37:30.816 --> 37:35.652
One misconception about zombies
is that they only eat brains,

37:35.654 --> 37:40.190
But zombies have an appetite
for all human flesh.

37:40.192 --> 37:42.726
How to be infected
by a zombie --

37:42.728 --> 37:49.266
The most common way of infection
is through a bite from a zombie.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.568
If you do encounter a zombie,

37:51.570 --> 37:57.641
Run away and contact your
local authorities immediately.

38:00.711 --> 38:03.113
Is it true
that a mass of zombies

38:03.115 --> 38:07.417
Can combine their push pressure
into a door-busting force?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.953
Jamie, Merle...

38:09.955 --> 38:11.688
Come on!
You want some of this?

38:11.690 --> 38:15.258
...And Savage head of the undead
Adam...

38:15.961 --> 38:17.927
...Are attempting
to find out.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.829
So far, unlike the door...

38:19.831 --> 38:21.031
Oh-ho!

38:22.601 --> 38:25.402
...This movie myth
is bearing up.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.636
Jamie, go now!

38:26.638 --> 38:30.874
But our human survivors aren't
going down without a fight.

38:30.876 --> 38:34.978
Suppose their hideout
wasn't such a rickety old barn.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.414
So, Jamie, what do you think
about this new door?

38:37.416 --> 38:39.816
Well, it's a lot tougher
than the last one.

38:39.818 --> 38:40.817
This is a proper gate.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.719
It's got carriage bolts
at the corners

38:42.721 --> 38:44.587
Of all
the main structural members.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.690
Something is going to
have to snap for them

38:46.692 --> 38:48.058
To make it through that.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.026
Okay, Adam.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.998
Huh, what a sight.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.199
Halt.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.135
We're coming for you, old man.

38:59.570 --> 39:02.138
Here we go!
Three, two, one.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.307
Push!

39:10.981 --> 39:11.548
Yep.

39:11.550 --> 39:15.552
The new and improved door
isn't nearly strong enough.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.355
Halt!
Zombies, we made it!

39:18.357 --> 39:21.091
Whoo!

39:25.262 --> 39:27.931
Not quite
because Jamie has something

39:27.933 --> 39:32.068
Up his sleeve that's
make-or-break for this myth,

39:32.070 --> 39:32.836
Literally.

39:32.838 --> 39:33.670
So here's the scenario.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.505
You've got 100 hungry zombies
after you.

39:35.507 --> 39:38.441
You've got a barn to hide in,
and we've already shown that

39:38.443 --> 39:41.945
That many zombies can exert
an enormous amount of pressure

39:41.947 --> 39:43.546
On something they push against.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.448
So what are you going to do?

39:45.450 --> 39:46.483
What they do in the movies

39:46.485 --> 39:48.952
Is they grab every spare piece
of lumber they can find

39:48.954 --> 39:53.623
And they nail it
all over the doors and windows.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.592
I don't trust those hinges.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.893
That's what I'm going to do.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.895
We've already built
a sturdy gate,

39:58.897 --> 40:00.697
But it's not
quite sturdy enough.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.966
So I'm just going to
nail the crap out of it,

40:02.968 --> 40:07.036
And we'll see whether
I can't hold them off that way.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.141
Let them sink their teeth
into that.

40:11.143 --> 40:14.244
This is the part of the episode
where things get exciting.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.478
Are you ready?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.947
Do your worst.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.549
I'm coming back with friends.

40:19.551 --> 40:23.319
We did some door reinforcement,
and now as to whether or not

40:23.321 --> 40:25.855
We will be able
to make it through this door

40:25.857 --> 40:30.160
With our collective amount
of force, I have no idea.

40:38.836 --> 40:39.636
I'm actually really curious

40:39.638 --> 40:41.738
About how good
Jamie's reinforcements are

40:41.740 --> 40:45.575
And how much power
we can bring to bear.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.078
This is awesome.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.680
Halt!

40:50.682 --> 40:52.715
Ready?
On the count of three.

40:52.717 --> 40:53.683
One, two, three!

40:53.685 --> 40:57.053
Ugh! Hold!
I heard some cracking. Hold on.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.655
We're going to try that
one more time.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.923
The same thing again.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.925
One, two, three!
Ugh!

41:01.927 --> 41:02.625
Oh, oh.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.827
Hold!
One more time.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.429
I think
we'll go through this door.

41:06.431 --> 41:08.698
You are meat, Hyneman.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.102
Hold on.
Three, two, one. Go!

41:13.104 --> 41:14.537
One, go!

41:14.539 --> 41:17.106
Oh!
It's repelled us.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.409
And that's bad news
for the myth.

41:19.411 --> 41:23.646
Unlike the movies, despite all
the creaking and cracking,

41:23.648 --> 41:25.982
Jamie's barn-door defenses
are holding.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.451
We're coming for you, old man.

41:28.453 --> 41:33.189
But if there's one thing zombies
have got, it's persistence.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.258
There's brains in there!

41:36.561 --> 41:38.628
Three! Two! One!

41:38.630 --> 41:40.563
Go!

41:43.701 --> 41:47.036
Huff and puff they might...

41:50.008 --> 41:51.207
Yes!
Yes!

41:51.209 --> 41:51.908
Yes! Push!

41:51.910 --> 41:54.844
...But the door remains tight.

41:58.717 --> 42:03.753
And Jamie
does his victory dance.

42:08.759 --> 42:11.828
Never going to happen.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.963
Zombies give up, Jamie.

42:13.965 --> 42:14.731
We give up.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.866
Zombies, let's go home!

42:17.502 --> 42:20.003
The zombies give up.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.004
Jamie's defenses held up,

42:21.006 --> 42:25.108
And our victor lives to fight
the living dead another day.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.977
The door was actually
really frightening me.

42:27.979 --> 42:32.482
It was bowing quite severely,
and we had screws pop out.

42:32.484 --> 42:36.486
The hinges themselves
are starting to curl

42:36.488 --> 42:37.720
And come inward.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.788
Three! Two! One! Go!

42:38.790 --> 42:42.058
But despite being compromised,

42:42.060 --> 42:43.126
It was never breached.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.295
I have to tell you,
having been right there

42:45.297 --> 42:48.731
At the center of all the action,
there was a couple of times

42:48.733 --> 42:50.333
I thought
it was going to give way.

42:50.335 --> 42:51.534
But there was
enough pieces of wood

42:51.536 --> 42:53.269
That even with the cracking
and the splitting

42:53.271 --> 42:54.904
And the bending
and the unrolling,

42:54.906 --> 42:57.507
I could still tell
that we could have batted

42:57.509 --> 42:58.241
On that all day long.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.476
We weren't going to
make it through.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.110
So where do we stand

43:01.112 --> 43:03.012
On the collective power
of zombies?

43:03.014 --> 43:06.049
Well, it does add up
if you have enough of them,

43:06.051 --> 43:07.250
But it's not limitless.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.952
No, it's not.

43:08.954 --> 43:09.519
Yep.

43:09.521 --> 43:12.155
And with the myth
that zombie-power can always pop

43:12.157 --> 43:16.125
Your hastily reinforced portal
well and truly busted,

43:16.127 --> 43:17.627
The day of the dead is done.

43:17.629 --> 43:19.128
Do you know
what I'm really glad about?

43:19.130 --> 43:21.898
What's that?
That zombies don't exist.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.499
What do you mean?
