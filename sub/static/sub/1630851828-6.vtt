‐ So far, every one‐on‐one date
resulted in a rose.

Now that we're having

19:58.164 --> 19:59.832

19:59.899 --> 20:01.701
are weighted
a lot more heavily.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.070
And so there's a chance
that, you know, Clayton

20:04.136 --> 20:05.738
doesn't come back tonight
because of that.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.273

with a rose.

‐ Probably the reason why a lot

20:58.157 --> 21:00.292

Yeah, actually.

56:25.115 --> 56:27.985
Um...[laughing]

56:32.890 --> 56:34.691
‐ You're gonna have
to hold me the entire way,

56:34.758 --> 56:37.261
'cause I'm nervous as hell
right now.

56:37.327 --> 56:39.529
‐ My parents aren't here.
They're gone.

56:39.596 --> 56:40.731
‐ Oh, okay, I thought
I was meeting the parents.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.599
‐ You're gonna‐‐

56:43.800 --> 56:45.002
‐ Didn't warn me at all,
all right.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.403
‐ Brandon's definitely
gonna get a tour

56:46.470 --> 56:48.205

56:48.272 --> 56:49.506
<i>where my parents still live.</i>

56:49.573 --> 56:51.675
I think stepping into my home,

56:51.742 --> 56:53.877
he's gonna learn
a lot about me.

56:53.944 --> 56:55.646
<i>And my family.</i>

56:58.348 --> 57:01.385
‐ Oh, man.
‐ Okay.

57:01.451 --> 57:03.553
So...
‐ Where do you go first?

57:03.620 --> 57:04.755
‐ Gotta love
some senior pictures.

57:04.821 --> 57:06.957
‐ Yeah.
Wow.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.058
Look how straight
your teeth are

57:08.125 --> 57:09.860
and everything.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.395
‐ Are they not like that
anymore?

57:11.461 --> 57:12.629
‐ No, no.
‐ [bleep]!

57:12.696 --> 57:13.697
‐ No, I didn't mean it
like that.

57:13.764 --> 57:14.898
I didn't mean it like that!

57:14.965 --> 57:16.099
<i>‐ Pictures, I think,</i>

57:16.166 --> 57:18.035

57:18.101 --> 57:22.439

57:22.506 --> 57:24.942

57:27.010 --> 57:29.246
‐ I know!
‐ Oh, my God.

57:29.313 --> 57:30.347
I'm walking through that house,

57:30.414 --> 57:31.782

the luckiest man

57:40.691 --> 57:44.294
Is this Miss Michelle's room?
Wow.

57:44.361 --> 57:46.897
‐ This was my room
growing up, actually.

57:46.964 --> 57:51.101
It's been quite a minute
since a love interest

57:51.168 --> 57:53.770
has been
in my childhood bedroom

57:53.837 --> 57:54.905
in my parents' house.

57:54.972 --> 57:56.707
It's so weird
to be back in here.

57:56.773 --> 57:58.442
‐ You know what's funny to me?

57:58.508 --> 58:00.243
I rolled up to you
the first day on my bed,

58:00.310 --> 58:01.678
and now I'm sitting in yours.

58:01.745 --> 58:04.047

58:04.114 --> 58:05.382

about that.

58:05.449 --> 58:07.384
‐ The first day
to the last day.

58:12.022 --> 58:14.191
I like you.
‐ I like you too.

58:19.930 --> 58:21.665
‐ Wait, is it okay
with your parents

58:21.732 --> 58:22.933
if you have a guy in the room?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.202
‐ [laughs]
‐ Are they okay with that?

58:26.403 --> 58:32.009
‐ So how do you feel
about taking a dip in the pool?

58:32.075 --> 58:35.112
‐ I would love that.
Let's do it.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.446
‐ You can wear
one of my dad's swimsuits

58:36.513 --> 58:37.814
now that I think of it.
‐ Okay.

58:37.881 --> 58:39.049
‐ I'm gonna give you
one of my dad's suits, yeah?

58:39.116 --> 58:40.050
‐ Yeah, let's do it.
‐ Okay.

58:43.754 --> 58:47.190
I mean, they're not here,

Oh, perfect.

They're still in the same spot.
Okay.

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:34.324
I think, you know,
she's definitely, like,

1:01:34.391 --> 1:01:37.127
the most special person
I've ever met.

1:01:37.194 --> 1:01:38.695
And that's why
I looked forward so much

1:01:38.762 --> 1:01:40.564
to meeting you guys
'cause, you know,

1:01:40.630 --> 1:01:42.799
my family raised me
and gave me that strength.

1:01:42.866 --> 1:01:44.834
And I could tell,
all the stories she's told

1:01:44.901 --> 1:01:47.470
about you guys,
it was the same for her.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:48.505
‐ Let's see, check.

1:01:48.572 --> 1:01:50.740
‐ Check?
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1:01:50.807 --> 1:01:52.943
‐ Nice answer.
‐ Nice answer? Cool.

1:01:53.009 --> 1:01:54.377
Yeah, so...

1:01:54.444 --> 1:01:57.380
‐ So when did you know
Brandon was special?

1:01:58.281 --> 1:02:00.350
‐ I think it was, like,
at the cocktail party

1:02:00.417 --> 1:02:03.186
the second Rose Ceremony,
going into it,

1:02:03.253 --> 1:02:05.188
where we had a conversation

1:02:05.255 --> 1:02:09.159
and he just talked about, like,
just how much he trusts me.

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:11.328
‐ Yeah, 'cause the first night
she said

1:02:11.394 --> 1:02:13.797
that, you know, she's here
for the right reason.

1:02:13.863 --> 1:02:15.565
And the one thing
she expected from us

1:02:15.632 --> 1:02:17.934
was trust.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:20.570
‐ I'm in good hands,
I'll tell you that.

1:02:20.637 --> 1:02:22.005
‐ Yeah, you two
look very good together.

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:23.240
‐ [chuckles]

1:02:25.141 --> 1:02:26.243
‐ Do you want kids?

1:02:26.309 --> 1:02:27.677
‐ I want three kids.
‐ Okay.

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:29.012
‐ Three kids?
All right.

1:02:29.079 --> 1:02:30.080
‐ We haven't talked
about that, but‐‐

1:02:30.146 --> 1:02:31.648
‐ I haven't either,
but that's mine!

1:02:31.715 --> 1:02:32.649
‐ Oh, yeah,
I want three kids.

1:02:32.716 --> 1:02:33.650
‐ It is actually,
and I knew that.

1:02:33.717 --> 1:02:34.684
‐ Oh, you did?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:35.719
‐ I did know that.
‐ Yeah.

1:02:35.785 --> 1:02:36.953
‐ Oh, yeah.
I want three kids.

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:38.121
‐ Right answer, Brandon.

1:02:38.188 --> 1:02:40.056
‐ We haven't talked about that,
but okay.

1:02:40.123 --> 1:02:41.157
‐ Um...
‐ Chalk one up for you.

1:02:41.224 --> 1:02:43.126
[laughter]

1:02:43.193 --> 1:02:44.861
‐ I believe that's two now.

1:02:44.928 --> 1:02:46.029
‐ It is.
‐ Good.

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:48.064
[laughter]

1:02:48.131 --> 1:02:49.666
‐ Yeah, so, I mean,

1:02:49.733 --> 1:02:51.268
your guys' marriage
is so special

1:02:51.334 --> 1:02:52.769
and so unique,

1:02:52.836 --> 1:02:55.472
so I wanted to know, like,
if you guys had any advice.

1:02:55.538 --> 1:02:59.075
‐ I'd say,
he was my best friend.

1:02:59.142 --> 1:03:00.076
The other thing, honestly,

1:03:00.143 --> 1:03:02.879
is that he always
puts me first.

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:05.849
Even in some pretty difficult
situations

1:03:05.915 --> 1:03:09.452
where he really had to choose,
and he did.

1:03:09.519 --> 1:03:12.889
He‐‐I always know
he has my back.

1:03:12.956 --> 1:03:15.925
So that's what I hope for her.

1:03:15.992 --> 1:03:17.460
‐ It's not easy.

1:03:17.527 --> 1:03:20.730
You know, it's gonna
always be the ups and downs.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:23.099
But you gotta always,
you know, be able

1:03:23.166 --> 1:03:26.936
to open up and talk
and work your way through it.

1:03:27.003 --> 1:03:28.004
You know, that's the key.

1:03:28.071 --> 1:03:29.172
I mean, it's like,

1:03:29.239 --> 1:03:30.940
just love that person to death,
actually.

1:03:31.007 --> 1:03:32.642
You know?

1:03:32.709 --> 1:03:35.712
‐ I think it's
not necessarily easy

1:03:35.779 --> 1:03:37.347
to meet someone's parents,

1:03:37.414 --> 1:03:40.183
let alone meet them
unexpectedly.

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:44.688
But Brandon held his own,
and he was genuine and sincere,

1:03:44.754 --> 1:03:46.556
<i>and he stayed true</i>
<i>to who he was.</i>

1:03:46.623 --> 1:03:49.259
And my parents seem
to really like him.

1:03:49.326 --> 1:03:50.560
‐ So it was scary,

1:03:50.627 --> 1:03:53.897
but it's also, like,
beautiful too, so...

1:03:53.963 --> 1:03:55.799
She just makes me happy.

1:03:55.865 --> 1:03:58.101
And now, meeting you guys,
I'm like, "Wow."

1:03:58.168 --> 1:03:59.436
You got two
of the greatest idols

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:02.405
to look up to, so...
‐ Mm‐hmm, I sure do.

1:04:02.472 --> 1:04:04.974
‐ Yeah, actually, can I talk
to your parents real quick?

1:04:05.041 --> 1:04:05.975
‐ Okay.
‐ Sure.

1:04:06.042 --> 1:04:07.043
‐ Is that okay?

1:04:07.110 --> 1:04:08.445
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay, okay. Cool.

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:11.915
‐ All right.
I'll be back shortly.

1:04:11.981 --> 1:04:13.149
‐ Okay.
‐ Hi

1:04:13.216 --> 1:04:14.851
‐ [chuckles]

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.523
‐ So I feel so deeply
for your daughter.

1:04:20.590 --> 1:04:23.793
And she absolutely means

<i>‐ I like Clayton the most.</i>

1:23:36.411 --> 1:23:38.247
He was open
to do a lot of things.

1:23:38.313 --> 1:23:39.248
Like, when I asked
to do his nails,

1:23:39.314 --> 1:23:40.983
he said yes.

1:23:41.049 --> 1:23:42.317
And I just like that.

1:23:42.384 --> 1:23:43.585
The other hand.

1:23:43.652 --> 1:23:44.720
‐ Oh.
‐ You want to do both?

1:23:44.786 --> 1:23:46.355
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay, we're doing both.

1:23:46.421 --> 1:23:48.957
We're going all in.
Okay.

1:23:50.459 --> 1:23:52.194
How long does this last?

1:23:52.261 --> 1:23:53.962

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:55.564

you almost said a month.

1:23:55.631 --> 1:23:56.565
Were you about to say a month?

1:23:56.632 --> 1:23:57.900
‐ Well, like‐‐well, it depends

1:23:57.966 --> 1:23:59.134
how good care you take of them.

1:23:59.201 --> 1:24:01.303
I want Clayton to find a wife.

1:24:01.370 --> 1:24:03.105
‐ You think he'll go find
someone from here?

1:24:03.171 --> 1:24:04.406
Like, what‐‐what do you think‐‐

1:24:04.473 --> 1:24:06.475
what do you think's next
for Clayton?

1:24:06.542 --> 1:24:08.977
‐ He'll be the next Bachelor.
