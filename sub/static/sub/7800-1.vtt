00:48.281 --> 00:52.183
Listen, you're in a privileged position
to learn a thing or two.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.776
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.378
Runteldat.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.219
I been through so much,
you know, in my life, so...

01:36.329 --> 01:39.093
I kind of wanted to get back out
and tell my own story.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.832
Maryland, DC, is my hometown,
so I grew up here.

01:48.741 --> 01:52.871
I'm a little man, so you kind of get
the 'little man"complex sometimes.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.106
You feel like you gotta
fight for everything.

01:55.215 --> 01:59.049
You even gotta fight for when the
french fries have been taken from you.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.447
First of all. We would like
to thank God...

02:30.550 --> 02:34.850
who just helping us to see another day
to get up to bring you comedy.

02:34.954 --> 02:38.219
Can you hear
what the fuck I'm saying?

02:44.864 --> 02:47.389
I'm not saying that all people
in the media are bad.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.129
Some of them do theirjob.
Some of them do the research...

02:51.237 --> 02:53.228
and they report the truth.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.239
Actor and comedian
Martin Lawrence...

02:55.341 --> 02:58.208
was apprehended by Los Angeles
police offiicers yesterday...

02:58.311 --> 03:02.008
after he was discovered in the middle
of one of LA 's most congested streets...

03:02.115 --> 03:04.845
hurling obscenities at passing cars.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.511
The popular television personality
was admitted to a nearby hospital...

03:07.620 --> 03:11.112
by LAPD offiicers
after they subdued him by force.

03:13.393 --> 03:17.056
No one is immune to the trials
and tribulations of life.

03:17.163 --> 03:20.098
No one. We all have ups,
and we all have downs.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.168
I mean, that's just life.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.865
Martin Lawrence's current scrape
with the law...

03:25.972 --> 03:28.031
could be evidence
of Martin's mania.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.541
Something's obviously
gone wrong in this man's head.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.134
I mean, hejust settled
a case out of court...

03:33.246 --> 03:36.238
because he attacked somebody
with a bottle who was making a toast.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.716
Why? Well, apparently,
he didn't like the phrasing.

03:39.819 --> 03:43.983
Martin's acting like a madman,
and people don't think it's funny.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.082
But other people in the media,
some reporters...

03:47.193 --> 03:50.185
and some tabloids,
they ain't interested in the truth.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.764
All right? They like
to sensationalize bullshit.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.833
You do the math.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.561
From bad boy on the big screen...

03:56.669 --> 03:58.261
to a menace in real life...

03:58.371 --> 04:02.307
how far will Martin's fans go
to stand behind their tarnished hero?

04:04.043 --> 04:07.342
It's easy to fade into obscurity
in Hollywood. Martin better watch out.

04:08.881 --> 04:12.442
If Martin doesn't clean up his act,
he's not gonna be acting anywhere.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.452
- I'm not perfect. I'm only human.
- Important words to live by.

04:18.825 --> 04:22.089
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em. Girl. Fuck 'em.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.628
We're all one 'cause we're
all human, you know.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.227
We experience a lot of the same things.
Just as we wake, we sleep.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.306
Just as we live, we die.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.932
That's just life, human nature.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.614
He had a body temperature
registering...

04:49.722 --> 04:53.158
at slightly over
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.784
He was, at that time,
in a coma and unresponsive.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.023
Fuck dying.
Fuck dying.

05:00.199 --> 05:03.430
Mama said. "The world is yours.
Don't sleep."

05:04.671 --> 05:06.070
Fuck dying.

05:06.172 --> 05:08.163
After spending
three days in a coma...

05:08.274 --> 05:10.174
Martin Lawrence's condition
is improving.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.744
His eyes will focus on a person.

05:12.845 --> 05:17.214
He can't talk just yet because
we do have a tube down his throat.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.547
But he is alert,
and he is improving.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.280
One of the achievements
I'm most proud of is...

05:22.388 --> 05:24.515
to be where I'm at
in this business today...

05:24.624 --> 05:26.353
after everything
that I've been through.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.995
You know, I can honestly say
I'm blessed.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.799
There's all kind of folks
that was just negative...

05:34.901 --> 05:36.869
when it came to Marty.

05:36.969 --> 05:37.867
- I remember that shit.
- Right.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.700
Well. We still here.
and they can run tell that.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.274
Runteldat. Nigger.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.572
We've been mashing city to city
for six months...

06:22.682 --> 06:25.242
putting this tour together.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.478
I think doing stand-up comedy...

06:27.587 --> 06:30.249
is one of the hardest things
that somebody could do, you know?

06:33.659 --> 06:37.493
You know, when you get on stage
and you got the microphone...

06:37.597 --> 06:40.225
and thousands of people,
you know...

06:40.333 --> 06:43.734
waiting for you to make 'em laugh,
you got to bring it.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.681
That's why I love it.
You know, it's a challenge.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.385
It's who I am.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.683
Yeah, it's game time.

07:17.870 --> 07:22.307
Ladies and gentlemen,
Martin Lawrence!

07:28.981 --> 07:29.879
Come on!

08:27.173 --> 08:28.508
DC. I love you.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.440
DC. I love you.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.635
I'm home.
I'm home.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.940
I love you so much.
Thank you.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.538
That was...
Hey. What can I say?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.652
You make it all worth it.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.984
What can I say. You know?
This is what it's about.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.525
Thank you.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.688
Oh. Man. And y'all look good.
Everybody's dressed tonight.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.732
Came out. "Fuck it. We going
to see that nigger. Fuck it.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.133
Show him some love."
Well. I had to come out tonight.

08:58.237 --> 09:01.673
I don't know if you just saw the film...
the tape and everything.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.436
I said. "Fuck it. I got to come out
and tell my own story."

09:04.544 --> 09:09.038
I ain't waitin' for the
E! True Hollywood Story to tell my shit.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.308
You know what I mean?

09:10.416 --> 09:13.078
Fuck that.
I got to tell my own shit.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.120
I see you. Baby.
Hey. How you doin'?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.487
Yeah. Hello. The ladies just screamin'
like a motherfucker.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.059
Yeah. Thank you.
I know.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.619
But if you want to scream.
please send your panties up here. Okay?

09:25.731 --> 09:27.699
Just put your number
on your panties...

09:27.800 --> 09:30.132
and I'll get back
according to the smell.

09:33.205 --> 09:37.835
Before I left the hotel. I was watching
something on TV... this lady.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.208
I'm gonna say. If you smoke.
please be careful...

09:40.313 --> 09:42.804
'cause I saw this lady on TV
had a hole in her neck.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.042
It was real bad.
Anybody see that shit?

09:45.151 --> 09:47.346
She was smoking the cigarette
with her neck. And she's. Like...

09:48.654 --> 09:51.214
And blowing the O's and shit
with her neck.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.521
Did anybody see that?
Please be careful if you smoke.

09:54.627 --> 09:58.996
'Cause that lady had a hole in her neck.
You could see food falling.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.431
When she eat. You could see string beans
and pudding and all that shit.

10:03.202 --> 10:06.467
You know?
I bet her breath don't stink.

10:06.572 --> 10:09.040
Her neck probably fuckin' stink.
huh. Man?

10:09.141 --> 10:12.770
You just put a fuckin' Altoid
in her neck and shit.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.540
If she choke on something. You ain't
gotta worry about the Heimlich.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.843
You just go right in the neck.
Got that.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.919
Yeah. A piece of gristle. Baby.
That's all that was. A piece of gristle.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.257
You got to love a woman
with a hole in her neck. Fellas. You do.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.589
Take her out to eat and shit.
Got a hole in her fuckin' neck.

10:28.694 --> 10:31.288
But you get mad. "Look. Goddamn it.
Look at your neck.

10:31.397 --> 10:35.163
What have you got to fuckin' come to
the restaurant with your neck all out?

10:35.267 --> 10:38.168
Got the fuckin' maÃ®tre d'

10:38.270 --> 10:40.966
Oh. You couldn't put on
a turtleneck or nothin' tonight?

10:41.073 --> 10:44.509
Couldn't put no mock neck on?
None of that shit?"

10:46.112 --> 10:49.673
They say this lady got a man.
I know they be doing some freaky shit.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.716
I know he come home.
"Baby...

10:51.817 --> 10:54.479
I want to do something
a little different tonight.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.955

in your neck.

10:58.057 --> 11:01.584
Oh. That's some good neck there.
That's some good neck there.

11:01.694 --> 11:05.186
Fuck head. I said neck.
I like neck."

11:05.297 --> 11:07.492
Her ass straight to here
and shit.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.844
And I'd like to say...

11:18.944 --> 11:20.969
if there's any critics
here tonight...

11:21.080 --> 11:23.480
fuck you and kiss my ass.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.780
I don't give a shit about you.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.378
They're like the scum of the earth
to me. Fuck them.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.514
I can't stand a critic.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.116
My mother don't like me to say
that I hate. But I can't stand 'em.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.856
What the fuck is a critic anyway? That's
somebody that can't do what you can do...

11:38.964 --> 11:41.797
so they want to criticize your shit.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.699
You know what I mean?
Think they authority on some shit.

11:44.804 --> 11:48.672
You want to criticize somethin'.
criticize these nuts.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.209
Fuck you.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.541
I don't see you
talkin' about my balls on the news.

11:54.647 --> 11:58.105
"One of Martin's balls
is bigger than the other.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.017
I give that a two star."
Get the fuck out of here. Man.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.422
But you know what? When I think about
everything that's going on...

12:07.760 --> 12:11.321
Critics are so unimportant to what's
going on with the USA attacks...

12:11.430 --> 12:14.991
everything that happened here. The
Pentagon and New York. All that stuff.

12:15.101 --> 12:19.765
My heart goes out to families that have
went through all this and lost people.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.238
I feel for 'em.

12:22.341 --> 12:26.209
And it's a sad thing.
It really is a sad thing because...

12:26.312 --> 12:29.372
I'm glad to be an American.
This is the best country in the world.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.541
I can say that. You know.

12:31.650 --> 12:36.280
I wouldn't want to be nowhere else.
but when I seen this shit happen...

12:36.388 --> 12:39.482
I think any of us could've been on them
planes and anything that happened...

12:39.592 --> 12:41.560
been in one of them buildings
that they crashed into.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.924
Any-fuckin'-body in here.
Know what I mean?

12:44.029 --> 12:47.055
If it affects one person.
it affects us all.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.966
And now my nerves are bad.
y'all. After this shit.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.039
I got to drink
Milk of Magnesia and shit.

12:54.140 --> 12:57.837
Every time before I board a plane.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.344
But out of all this. This is one
of the first times in a long time...

13:01.447 --> 13:04.439
since I don't know when...
This is one of the first times...

13:04.550 --> 13:08.179
I seen black and white people together
on something. Standing for a cause.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.721
It wasn't about race.
It's just about life.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.291
You know what I mean?
Nothin' else but life.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.360
Together on somethin'.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.759
We will get together
and fuck you up today...

13:17.863 --> 13:20.331
on this USA attacks.
you know what I mean?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.559
I ain't seen black and white people
together since...

13:22.668 --> 13:25.728
Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney
did "Ebony and Ivory."

13:29.475 --> 13:31.670
So now. If I go to board a plane.
if you like me...

13:31.777 --> 13:34.769
you get nervous as a motherfucker.
you see somebody boardin'.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.677
You sit there talking
to your white friend.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.750
"What's up. White boy.
I don't know you...

13:38.851 --> 13:42.446
but we getting on this plane together
and shit. Might as well be together.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.720
Who's that motherfucker getting
on the plane right there?

13:46.826 --> 13:50.489
You don't know that motherfucker?
Oh. Shit.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.063
Hakbim.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.126
You about to get on
this motherfuckin' plane. Man?

13:56.235 --> 13:59.636
Don't start no motherfuckin' shit
when we get on this plane. All right?

13:59.738 --> 14:01.831
I'll punch you
in your motherfuckin' mouth. Nigger.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.399
Nigger. Don't go for your hands.
Don't move your hands. Hold on.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.537
What you got in your shoes. Nigger?
What the fuck you got in your shoes?

14:08.647 --> 14:11.582
I'm-a tell you. Don't start no shit
when we get on this plane. Nigger.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.176
I will knock your motherfuckin'
ass the fuck out. I ain't playin'.

14:15.287 --> 14:18.779
We ain't done shit.
Don't start nothin'.

14:18.891 --> 14:22.122
'Cause the white boy can wrestle.
and I can box. Motherfucker.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.758
He'll tackle your ass.
and I'll punch the fuck out you.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.069
Don't start no shit."

14:31.971 --> 14:34.872
But your nerves is bad
with these USA attacks and shit.

14:34.974 --> 14:38.501
You don't know what's going on.
They lookin' for bin Laden.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.704
They ain't found his ass yet.

14:40.813 --> 14:46.410
How you not find... You blew up all that
shit. And you ain't found bin Laden yet?

14:46.518 --> 14:48.645
That motherfucker
at a club right now.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.855
What the fuck is that shit about?

14:57.963 --> 15:01.296
Ain't found no bin Laden.
You know why?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.528
'Cause a lot of motherfuckers
look like bin Laden.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.038
There's a nigger in McDonald's right now
look just like bin Laden.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.472
Got a high-top fade
and every-fuckin'-thing.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.771
You walk in that motherfucker
to get a cheeseburger...

15:14.380 --> 15:16.405
"Bin Laden! That's bin Laden!

15:16.515 --> 15:18.483
Call the government.
That's motherfuckin' bin Laden.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.916
I know a motherfuckin' bin Laden
when I see...

15:21.020 --> 15:23.454
Call the Taliban. Nigger.
That's him."

15:25.691 --> 15:28.285
'Cause they looked. Man.
You can't even find his ass.

15:28.394 --> 15:31.090
I almost fucked an Indian up
on the way in here.

15:31.196 --> 15:34.859
He said. "No. I Indian. I Indian."
I said. "Pull your turban up. Nigger.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.933
Let me see a dot or somethin'.
motherfucker.

15:40.039 --> 15:43.805
I'll fuck your ass up.
Don't start no shit.

15:43.909 --> 15:46.241
I'll crack that fuckin' dot.
Don't start it."

15:48.614 --> 15:52.744
It's just all crazy. What's this shit
about you can't open up mail?

15:52.851 --> 15:57.311
What the fuck is that shit?
You can't open up fuckin' mail?

15:57.423 --> 15:59.653
You open up mail.
you all fucked up.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.435
What the fuck is that shit?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.872
Can't open mail.

16:15.007 --> 16:18.807
That's probably a good thing
for the bill collectors though.

16:18.911 --> 16:23.211
You know. They call your house.
"Hi. Mr. Lawrence. Yeah.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.250
I sent out a bill
about three weeks ago...

16:26.352 --> 16:28.252
and I haven't received
payment on that.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.949
I was wondering if...
Was there a problem?

16:32.057 --> 16:35.549
Well. Is there a reason
that that's not paid?"

16:36.495 --> 16:38.486
"Ain't you been
watching the news. Nigga?

16:39.698 --> 16:41.928
I can't open it. Motherfucker.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.532
They got powder
and shit in there...

16:45.637 --> 16:49.698
that makes you lose your eyebrows
in 4.2 seconds. Motherfucker.

16:49.808 --> 16:53.642
You're welcome to bring your ass
over here and open it yourself...

16:53.746 --> 16:55.714
Mr. Bill Man."

16:57.349 --> 17:01.149
It's fucking crazy. Man. Anthrax.
This shit just don't make no sense.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.381
Now. I'll tell you.
life is so short. Y'all.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.458
You know. Please.
just realize that.

17:06.558 --> 17:09.220
You're not promised tomorrow.
you know.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.296
You really ain't.
You're not.

17:11.396 --> 17:14.888
Every day you get a chance to wake up.
you gotta really be grateful.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.968
Most importantly. Be grateful...

17:17.069 --> 17:19.799
and ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.873
Live your life.

17:21.973 --> 17:26.035
Ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.342
When it's time to go. You're gone.
Fuck it. You don't owe nobody. Fuck it.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.575
If you do owe 'em. You're gone.
They can't get it.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.186
So now with all that... You know.
that gets you down every now and then.

17:38.290 --> 17:42.283
'Cause you see it every time
you turn on the news and all that.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.862
It's something that's gonna
be with us a long time.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.659
You know. That's just...
for the rest of our lives.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.633
I'm trying to do things
that make me feel good.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.068
Like. I'm watching Cops.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.705
Black people. Come on. Y'all know
we on Cops every fuckin' week.

17:57.810 --> 18:02.110
Every motherfuckin' week. Cops.
Black people. Starring black people.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.911
We runnin' through the motherfucker
with helicopters chasing us and shit.

18:06.018 --> 18:09.510
Go to commercial. Come back.
We still runnin' and shit.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.521
Runnin' like a motherfucker.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.887
You know. Just runnin'
in the fuckin' street. Man.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.790
But one thing I noticed
on Cops... Is it me?

18:16.895 --> 18:20.922
But white people get away
with a lot of shit with the cops.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.763
They talk to the cop.
They talk back like a motherfucker.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.805
They cuss their ass out. "What the fuck
did you pull me over for?

18:27.906 --> 18:32.275
I don't give a shit. I want to know
what did you pull me over for.

18:32.377 --> 18:37.314
I didn't fuckin' do nothin'. Asshole.
You fuckin' asshole. You're an asshole.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.976
You're an asshole.
and you're a dick. Yes.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.645
Fuck that. Man.
You don't pull me over for nothin'.

18:42.754 --> 18:46.815
Yeah. I know I was speeding.
ya fuck. I'm in a rush.

18:46.925 --> 18:50.019
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're an asshole.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.029
And fuck you.
You're an asshole.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.295
And you're a dick. You know what.
why don't you put your dick in your ass?

18:56.401 --> 19:01.998
Fuck you. Fuck you.
My dad's gonna have your ass.

19:02.107 --> 19:06.305
There goes your $5 million
donation. You fuck.

19:07.346 --> 19:10.042
See your ass in court. Buddy."

19:11.250 --> 19:13.912
They cuss the cops out
like a motherfucker.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.214
Black people. We don't
do that shit no more.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.757
Ever since that Rodney King
ass-whupping. We shut the fuck up.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.658
'Cause you never know if that shit's
gonna be us on TV tomorrow on tape.

19:23.762 --> 19:26.925
They pull us over. We...
"What's the problem. Officer?

19:27.032 --> 19:30.229
Yes. Was I what?
I was speedin'? Damn.

19:30.335 --> 19:34.169
Where's the light? I didn't even
see me go through the light. Damn it.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.798
Look here. Would you
give me a ticket?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.309
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause I got to learn.

19:39.411 --> 19:42.175
I got to fuckin' learn. You know.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.249
Let me give you my full name.
my middle name.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.317
Let me spell that for you and stuff."

19:48.554 --> 19:51.648
We only that nice 'cause we know
we got some shit under the seat.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.716
Who knows what that is?
But...

19:55.827 --> 19:58.591
Latinos. They act like
they ain't from this country.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.858
They don't speak their English
when they get pulled over...

20:00.966 --> 20:03.526
till they see that ticket price.

20:03.635 --> 20:07.503
They get pulled over.
"No. No. What I do? I don't know.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.574
I don't know what I do.

20:09.675 --> 20:13.304
Speedy Gonzalez?
Was I caught speeding?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.104
Don't know."

20:17.416 --> 20:20.544
They see that ticket.
"Motherfucker. This is bullshit!"

20:25.891 --> 20:29.725
But I talk about watching
positive programs. You know.

20:29.828 --> 20:33.264
I joke about the cop shit. 'cause
ain't nothin' positive about that...

20:33.365 --> 20:35.595
gettin' arrested.
I'll tell you that.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.760
But a program that is positive.
if you ever get a chance to see it...

20:37.869 --> 20:40.565
it's called Eye on the Prize.

20:40.672 --> 20:44.403
This program will make you cry.
you know. I'm serious.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.034
If you ever seen it. You've seen that.
It's a beautiful thing.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.204
I'll tell you.
I love America.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.408
This is the best country in the world.
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.781
But I'm a black man.
and I ain't forgot...

20:54.886 --> 20:58.913
what the fuck we. As black people.
have been through in America.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.458
You know what I mean?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.528
We ain't gonna just
act like shit is all right...

21:03.629 --> 21:06.154
but we gonna work towards change.
to make it better.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.565
That's what people... in this
Eye on the Prize... have done for us.

21:10.669 --> 21:15.038
They put their lives out there
so that we can be in the forefront...

21:15.140 --> 21:17.108
so that we can better ourselves.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.700
Isn't that beautiful. When you
look at Eye on the Prize...

21:19.811 --> 21:24.475
when you think of segregation
and civil rights and all those things?

21:24.583 --> 21:27.916
When I was watching Eye on the Prize,
you had Martin Luther King...

21:28.020 --> 21:30.079
you know.
great man in history...

21:30.188 --> 21:34.318
Malcolm X... great man in history...
standing up for us...

21:34.426 --> 21:36.656
so that we could sit together.
blacks and whites.

21:36.762 --> 21:40.198
Work together. Freedom!
Grow together. That's beautiful.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.427
Martin said...

21:43.535 --> 21:45.503
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

21:45.604 --> 21:48.095
We shall overcome.
I've been to the mountaintop.

21:48.206 --> 21:50.367
Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

21:50.475 --> 21:54.036
Malcolm said. "Yeah.
but by any means necessary."

21:56.114 --> 21:58.947
Martin said.
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

21:59.985 --> 22:02.476
"By any means necessary."

22:02.587 --> 22:04.555
Martin and Malcolm
were saying the same thing.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.454
They just had different opinions
and different approaches to it.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.357
I thought that was beautiful.
I said. "That's all right."

22:10.462 --> 22:14.558
But then one day I was watchin'.
and Martin Luther King...

22:14.666 --> 22:19.330
And I'm named after Martin.
I was proud. Martin!

22:19.438 --> 22:22.202
I watched him
go through Birmingham. Alabama.

22:22.307 --> 22:26.835
And this racist white boy
picked up a rock...

22:26.945 --> 22:30.813
you know. Like a half a boulder
or some shit.

22:30.916 --> 22:34.682
He pitched that motherfucker like he
was pitchin' for the Orioles...

22:34.786 --> 22:37.687
and hit Martin in his head.

22:37.789 --> 22:41.088
And all Martin did was say.
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.787
Don't nobody do nothin'.
Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

22:43.895 --> 22:45.863
My head's bleeding right now.

22:45.964 --> 22:48.455
Don't nobody do nothin'.
We shall overcome.

22:48.567 --> 22:52.264
I've been to the mountaintop. I'm
having a dream right now. Nonviolent.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.272
Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

22:56.308 --> 22:58.708
I was proud. I said. "Damn.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.370
That takes a strong man
to get hit in the head...

23:01.480 --> 23:05.416
with a half a boulder
and still say 'nonviolent. ' Damn!"

23:08.887 --> 23:11.378
But if you're like me...

23:11.490 --> 23:14.152
then one time you would have
loved to hear Martin say...

23:14.259 --> 23:17.422
"Another one of you motherfuckers
hit me with a rock...

23:18.563 --> 23:21.498
I'll beat your bitch ass.
you motherfucker.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.296
Fuck that. Coretta.
These niggers think I'm soft.

23:24.403 --> 23:28.032
Let me show you how Martin
get down. Motherfucker.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.108
This is how Martin get down."

23:32.110 --> 23:36.137
I know he got on his boys.
I know he was here and said. "Jesse.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.342
Damn it. Jesse. You seen
who threw that fuckin' rock. Jesse.

23:40.385 --> 23:42.853
Get off your ass
and go handle that.

23:44.222 --> 23:47.055
Stop chasing them ho's. Jesse."

23:55.233 --> 23:57.201
Can I get a little water?

24:00.839 --> 24:02.807
I gotta ask y'all.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.966
There's predominantly
black people in here.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.044
They don't want you to pause
in no show.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.084
"Come on. Hurry up."

24:14.186 --> 24:16.746
Somebody put something in his mouth.
My zipper's stuck. Y'all.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.159
I warned you.
Watch your mouth now.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.327
Don't forget who the original
DefJam host was. Motherfucker.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.446
I know I'm gettin' old.
Thirty-six. Man.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.707
You know. Gettin' older. Yeah.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.750
You don't do the same things
you do when you get older.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.650
I want to grow old gracefully.
Gettin' old ain't no joke.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.245
It's. Like. You know. When you
see older people... old people...

24:52.357 --> 24:55.053
you gotta really show 'em
some respect and love...

24:55.160 --> 24:57.788
'cause there's
a lot of wisdom there.

24:57.896 --> 25:01.093
They're livin' their life.
They got seniority here in this life.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.190
You gotta show 'em
some love. Man.

25:05.403 --> 25:07.837
I know when I get old...
That's why I said until that point...

25:07.939 --> 25:10.669
I'm gonna ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

25:10.775 --> 25:14.506
Live your life. I'm sure that's what
an old person will tell you.

25:14.613 --> 25:19.448
You think about it. You look around.
This is just a body of life right here.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.111
You got some young.
You got some old and everything.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.018
Just look around. That's what it is.
It goes in a cycle.

25:25.123 --> 25:28.820
You go young. Old. Old. Young.
Young. Old. And that's it.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.122
That's about fuckin' it.
Think about it.

25:31.229 --> 25:33.959
The shit just recycles itself.
Like. The same things happen.

25:34.065 --> 25:37.228
When you're a baby.
you got one tooth.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.706
When you get old...

25:41.806 --> 25:44.434
you got one motherfuckin' tooth
just hanging on. Just...

25:46.378 --> 25:49.313
And that motherfucker
fragiler than a motherfucker.

25:49.414 --> 25:52.941
You gotta cut the apple
to eat the shit. You know.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.454
When you're a baby...

25:56.555 --> 25:59.183
you know what I mean.
you wear diapers.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.351
When you get old. You got
motherfuckin' adult Pampers on.

26:03.795 --> 26:05.956
When you're a baby.
you're in that little walker...

26:06.064 --> 26:08.430
trying to strengthen your legs.
tryin' to walk.

26:09.768 --> 26:12.464
When you get old. You're in
that metal motherfuckin' walker.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.740
You got one patch of hair
when you're a baby.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.866
You got a patch of fuckin' hair
when you're old.

26:18.977 --> 26:21.411
You try to cornrow
that motherfucker.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.343
Tryin' to hang on to
what little hip-hop you got left.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.487
It's just a cycle that goes like that.
That's all it is. A cycle.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.752
When I get old... I don't give a fuck...
don't do me no favors.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.418
Leave me at home.
Let me watch the birds. Like I said.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.758
Don't be taking me
to no motherfucking game.

26:38.863 --> 26:41.525
"Martin would want to go
to the basketball game."

26:41.633 --> 26:44.363
They'd take me to the game
and then announce me.

26:44.469 --> 26:47.529
"Ladies and gentlemen. We got
Martin Lawrence in the house."

26:47.639 --> 26:49.607
I'm older than a motherfucker.

26:51.743 --> 26:55.338
All they do is sit you up front
and exploit the fuck out you.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.745
Got the camera
all in your face and shit.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.515
You sittin' there. Can't even
follow the basketball game and shit.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.851
You down here. They playin'
down this motherfucker.

27:12.497 --> 27:15.295
Catch you falling asleep and shit.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.239
Don't put me at no motherfuckin'
game and sit me up front...

27:26.344 --> 27:28.972
puttin' an old-ass
Washington Wizard hat on me.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.911
With Jordan's signature
on the motherfucker.

27:38.189 --> 27:40.157
Talk about...
"How's he like the game?"

27:40.258 --> 27:43.785
"He says it's wonderful."
I ain't said shit.

27:43.895 --> 27:47.888
I said. "Get my ass home.
I don't want to do shit. I'm chillin'."

27:47.999 --> 27:51.400
I'll tell you. The beauty of getting old
is that you do things differently.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.734
Know what I mean? Even your dancin'
changes when you get older.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.774
Young people. They go
do all the wild stuff.

27:57.876 --> 28:01.175
Old people don't do that. They keep it
in one place. "All right. Now.

28:04.382 --> 28:06.441
That's what
I'm talking about right there.

28:06.551 --> 28:10.681
Yeah. Ain't gonna do
too much more than this here tonight.

28:11.723 --> 28:14.886
That's right. Ain't gonna have me
winded out this motherfucker all night.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.359
I got about
two more dips in me now.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.829
One dip. All right.

28:20.932 --> 28:24.663
That's it. That's it.
One more dip. I'm done.

28:24.769 --> 28:28.205
Shit. I'm tired. I ain't gonna be
doin' that shit all night.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.274
You tryin' to kill
a motherfucker."

28:31.643 --> 28:35.238
There's a dance out right now.
A lot of people like this dance.

28:35.346 --> 28:38.179
It's like the... What is it?

28:38.283 --> 28:40.274
It's like the Electric Slide...

28:40.385 --> 28:42.979
but it's not quite
the Electric Slide.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.056
The cha-cha?

28:45.156 --> 28:48.182
Yeah. I can't stand
that fuckin' dance.

28:48.293 --> 28:52.662
That's a easy fuckin' dance. Y'all.
You know that dance is easy as shit.

28:52.764 --> 28:56.598
Come on. "Two to the right.
One to the left.

28:56.701 --> 28:59.135
Stop. Think about it."

29:00.739 --> 29:03.367
Get the fuck out of here
with that shit.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.838
"Take your leg like this here.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.880
Do your arm like this.

29:13.017 --> 29:16.350
Stop. Think about it."

29:16.454 --> 29:18.649
That bullshit.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.193
I know the fuckin' ghetto Hokey Pokey
when I hear that shit.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.296
You know what I mean?
"Do your hip like this one time.

29:32.637 --> 29:35.299
Now keep doing
your hip like this."

29:36.374 --> 29:38.604
Get the fuck outta here.

29:39.844 --> 29:42.438
I respect a brother's hustle.
but that's bullshit. Man.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.708
That shit easy.

29:45.917 --> 29:49.512
You know. The thing about gettin' old.
I'll tell you. Gettin' older is like...

29:49.621 --> 29:53.318
If you have good kids
and you raise good kids...

29:53.424 --> 29:56.018
your children will take care of you
when you're older.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.364
Yeah. That's true.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.463
That's a beautiful thing.
That's what you want.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.867
You want to raise good kids.
I have two beautiful daughters.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.407
And I'm proud of them.
I love them. Thank you.

30:10.508 --> 30:14.706
But you get... Kids will take...
Good kids will take care of you.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.874
But you know them badass kids like
the motherfuckin' Menendez brothers...

30:18.983 --> 30:21.884
you gotta whup their ass. Man.
them little badass kids.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.580
If you don't get them bad kids when
they're young. They will fuck you up.

30:24.689 --> 30:27.180
That's how them brothers did that shit
to their mother and father.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.192
They ought to have
their ass kicked.

30:29.294 --> 30:31.194
I don't like them
badass kids. I tell you.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.730
You gotta get 'em early.
'cause if you don't...

30:33.832 --> 30:35.925
them motherfuckers will
put you in time-out.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.533
They will say. "Get your ass
in time-out. Dad.

30:40.638 --> 30:43.163
Get your fucking time-out. Dad!"

30:43.274 --> 30:45.174
"Goddamn. What did
I do there. Dave?

30:45.276 --> 30:48.370
I don't know what the fuck I did wrong.
What did I do?"

30:48.479 --> 30:50.845
"Just shut the fuck up
and get a time-out!"

30:52.650 --> 30:54.618
You know what I mean?
Telling you shit like...

30:54.719 --> 30:56.880
"Don't touch my Twinkies
in the fridge. Motherfucker.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.548
I'll be home about 9:00."

30:59.657 --> 31:02.455
'Cause they get all tall and lanky.
and they bigger than you and shit.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.460
Then they think they run you.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.122
They try to run the phone
that you pay the bill on.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.291
"Hang the motherfuckin'
phone up. Dad!

31:09.400 --> 31:12.164
Hang the motherfuckin'
phone up. Dad!

31:12.270 --> 31:14.534
I'm on the phone talkin'
to my homies. Nigger!"

31:16.307 --> 31:19.105
Shit! You gotta get
their little ass. Man.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.576
You gotta let them know.
You gotta put fear in their heart.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.944
"I'm the parent. You ever raise up
on me... I don't play that shit."

31:25.049 --> 31:27.108
They gotta fear you
for the rest of their life...

31:27.218 --> 31:29.243
if they don't fear
no-fucking-body else.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.356
That is yours.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.085
You gotta make 'em know.
You gotta make 'em understand.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.923
Don't play with Daddy.
Don't play with Mama.

31:38.029 --> 31:40.691
But you know what started
some of that shit is that time-out.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.766
White people. Y'all started that.
I ain't pickin' on you.

31:44.869 --> 31:48.396
But that time-out shit?
Uh-uh! Ain't gonna work.

31:48.506 --> 31:51.134
You know. I seen this
white kid tell his mother...

31:51.242 --> 31:54.405
"Fuck you. Mommy. You ho. You bitch.
You ho. You bitch."

31:54.512 --> 31:58.004
All she said was.
"Bobby. Go to time-out.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.084
Go to time-out. Bobby.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.209
You have some emotional issues
that you need to deal with.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.288
Go to time-out."

32:04.389 --> 32:06.414
And all the way to time-out.
he sang this shit.

32:06.524 --> 32:09.015
You ho, you bitch
You bitch, you ho

32:10.094 --> 32:11.288
Putting mixes on it.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.990
Bitch, bitch ho

32:15.433 --> 32:17.958
All my bitches
Say ho

32:19.304 --> 32:23.434
Shit! You don't tell
no black parent that shit.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.077
Fuck you, you ho
You bi...

32:28.346 --> 32:29.938
Take time-out.
Pick up your teeth.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.809
Take time-out.
Pick up your wisdoms.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.755
Take time and get my foot
up out your ass.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.783
Fuck the time-out.
That shit don't work.

32:43.895 --> 32:46.921
I know what happens is you're scared
to discipline your child...

32:47.031 --> 32:49.022
'cause now there's a law
that says you can get arrested...

32:49.133 --> 32:51.328
if you whup your child's ass.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.496
Hey. Whup your child's ass...

32:55.840 --> 32:57.831
if they act up.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.910
If they're showing off...

33:00.011 --> 33:02.377
If they're showing off.
that's when you whup their ass.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.506
Hey. Iook. I got a lot of ass-whuppings.
and look at me now.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.887
But you gotta... If they're showing off.
you gotta tear their ass up.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.958
You can't even be
trippin' on that.

33:14.058 --> 33:16.026
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.095
I understand
what the law's saying.

33:18.196 --> 33:21.825
You can't be in the street fighting them
like you're in a real fight.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.901
Talkin' about.
"Come on. Fuck that.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.904
You're gonna eat
your Rice Krispies.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.337
You're gonna eat
your Rice Krispies."

33:29.440 --> 33:32.967
I understand that shit.
But you know what you gotta do?

33:33.077 --> 33:36.843
You gotta learn how to hit 'em quick
and then walk 'em to the car.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.415
You gotta...

33:39.550 --> 33:41.518
Then walk 'em to the car.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.085
"Hi. Officer. Yeah.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.158
Oh. No. Just out taking
a stroll. That's all.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.227
Yeah. Okeydokey.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.558
Get your ass in there!"

33:52.663 --> 33:56.030
You're driving and shit.
hit him with the seat buckle.

33:56.134 --> 33:59.865
"Shut up!
Never fuckin' embarrass me in public.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.872
You like to got my ass arrested.
I'll fuck you up!"

34:05.376 --> 34:07.970
Shit. That's why
you gotta get 'em.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.047
You gotta scare them.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.116
They could be babies.

34:12.216 --> 34:15.049
Little infants. Little newborns.

34:15.152 --> 34:17.917
You gotta let 'em know.
Instill that fear that you the parent.

34:18.022 --> 34:20.013
You gotta instill
that shit in them!

34:20.123 --> 34:23.252
You go to their motherfucking crib
and wake their ass up.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.091
"What's up. You little motherfucker?
What's up?

34:26.197 --> 34:28.097
Wake your little ass up.
little nigger.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.132
Let me tell you something.
This Daddy here. Motherfucker.

34:30.234 --> 34:34.795
You ever raise up on me. I will knock
your motherfucking ass the fuck out!

34:34.906 --> 34:39.070
Don't play with me!
This Daddy. Nigger!"

34:42.013 --> 34:44.139
You gotta catch 'em when
they're coming out the pussy.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.375
"What up.
you little motherfucker?

34:49.654 --> 34:52.248
This Daddy. Nigger!
This Da...

34:52.356 --> 34:54.449
Get your little ass here!
Get off...

34:54.559 --> 34:56.754
Get off the umbilical cord!
Get the fuck off!

34:56.860 --> 35:00.388
Let me tell you something. I will
knock your motherfucking ass out!

35:00.498 --> 35:02.796
Don't play with me!

35:02.900 --> 35:04.800
Don't come here.

35:04.902 --> 35:08.269
Don't come here.
start no shit!"

35:10.108 --> 35:12.838
Best believe. That's the gift
that keeps on giving.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.674
When they 18. 19.
go to them clubs and shit...

35:15.780 --> 35:18.180
partying with their friends.
forgetting everything.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.649
They don't know nothing.
Send a prerecorded tape to the DJ.

35:21.752 --> 35:25.188
"Get your little motherfucking
ass home! Nigger. Get home now!"

35:25.289 --> 35:27.314
"Oh. Shit! I gotta go!

35:27.425 --> 35:30.622
Oh. God! My dad's in here!

35:30.728 --> 35:34.391
Who mixed him with Tupac?
Who mixed him with Tupac?

35:34.499 --> 35:36.467
Oh. Shit!"

35:42.140 --> 35:43.607
Get 'em!

35:43.708 --> 35:47.200
Like I said. That's the gift
that just keeps on giving.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.477
But that's what it's about. Man.

35:50.581 --> 35:53.414
And those are the bad kids.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.486
But you got good kids.

35:55.586 --> 36:00.114
It starts even in the...
in the delivery room...

36:00.224 --> 36:03.352
like when. You know.
the ladies are giving birth.

36:03.461 --> 36:07.693
And I commend you. Ladies. That's
a wonderful thing. Woman. That you do.

36:07.798 --> 36:09.766
I commend you.

36:09.867 --> 36:13.200
To be able to do that is...
It's beautiful.

36:13.304 --> 36:15.795
'Cause I know. Men.
we couldn't do it.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.842
If we had to have babies.
there'd be one motherfucker in here.

36:20.478 --> 36:24.414
But ladies go through that.
and the strength of a woman. Man. Wow!

36:24.515 --> 36:27.712
It's a wonderful thing.
It's beautiful when you see that.

36:27.818 --> 36:31.720
You're getting ready to have the baby.
and the baby's in there.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.723
You gotta be strong. Secure and know
everything's gonna be all right.

36:34.825 --> 36:37.350
'Cause if it's not.
it'll fuck you up.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.827
You stand there
with the nurse and shit looking.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.899
She in the hospital
about to deliver that thing.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.661
You're with the nurse.
"Is she gonna be all right?

36:44.769 --> 36:47.260
'Cause she seems like
she in a lot of pain."

36:47.371 --> 36:50.204
The nurse calming you down.
You got the doctor over there.

36:50.308 --> 36:53.573
Then all of a sudden. The baby
start coming out. And you go...

36:53.678 --> 36:57.580
"Oh. Shit!
Oh. God! Oh!

36:57.682 --> 37:02.619
Look at the head on that
little motherfucker! Oh. Man!

37:02.720 --> 37:04.654
Look at the fuckin'
circumference on his head!

37:04.755 --> 37:08.156
Oh. Shit!

37:08.259 --> 37:10.989
He's tearing up the pussy!

37:12.997 --> 37:15.932
That was my fit!
That was my fit!

37:16.033 --> 37:19.025
Oh. Fuck!
Now look at that shit!

37:19.136 --> 37:21.104
All these years
I look for that woman...

37:21.205 --> 37:24.231
I found her. And now
the fit is all fucked up!

37:25.476 --> 37:27.876
I don't know!
Talk to the doctor.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.470
Nothing. Baby. You're doing good.
You're doing real good.

37:30.581 --> 37:33.311
We're just talking about how.
just how well you're doing.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.647
Damn it. Iook how big
that fucking hole is.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.557
Well. You tell me. Nurse.
what am I supposed... Look at that hole!

37:40.658 --> 37:43.456
I can't follow that.

37:43.561 --> 37:46.496
What the fuck am I supposed to do.
fuck her with my knee?

37:47.765 --> 37:50.097
Huh? Do some shit
like this here?

37:50.201 --> 37:52.101
What is that shit?

37:55.439 --> 37:56.906
Oh. Shit.

38:01.112 --> 38:05.173
What the fuck is that big-ass. Twisty.
tied-up baby hanging on?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.183
Oh. God. It looks like a...

38:07.285 --> 38:09.310
Oh. That's the umbilical...
Okay.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.253
Oh. God. Oh. Shit!

38:12.356 --> 38:14.950
I'm nauseous.

38:15.059 --> 38:17.027
Oh. God.
Oh. My God.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.427
What is that fuckin' chitlin bag
hanging out the pussy?

38:20.531 --> 38:22.795
That's a big-ass chitlin bag.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.205
Looks like
a fuckin' gizzard bag.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.505
Hold up. Now I'm confused.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.584
Is she a woman.
or is she a fucking turkey?

38:41.786 --> 38:43.754
What the hell is that?"

38:49.593 --> 38:51.060
And then...

38:55.433 --> 38:57.401
And the baby's born.

38:58.469 --> 39:01.905
And then you ain't
as nauseous no more...

39:02.006 --> 39:06.568
'cause you just saw the strength
of a woman. And it turned you on.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.669
You walk up to her.
and the doctor clears out and stuff.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.977
Takes off all his surgical stuff.
You pass him. Damn near passing out.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.484
Talking about.
"I don't know how you do it."

39:15.586 --> 39:18.054
And you come up to her
and say. "Damn. Girl.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.920
You did it. Baby.
Yeah. You did it. You know.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.392
You somethin'.
Yeah. I'll get you some ice chips.

39:24.495 --> 39:27.362
Hold on. Here's some ice chips.
Okay. Yeah. You did it.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.956
I appreciate you. Girl. Yeah."

39:31.836 --> 39:33.571
And you're lookin' at her and stuff.
and you look at the baby.

39:33.571 --> 39:34.970
And you're lookin' at her and stuff.
and you look at the baby.

39:35.072 --> 39:38.098
You say. "Yeah. That's us.
We did that.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.509
It's hard to believe that the night
I had your legs on the chandelier...

39:42.613 --> 39:45.104
that's what we got.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.276
Yeah. Wow. Wow. Baby.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.354
I'm gonna let you get some rest.
all right? I love you.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.422
I'm gonna let you get some rest.
I'll be back.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.423
Okay. All right."

39:54.525 --> 39:57.153
So you start walking out.
and it hits you.

39:57.261 --> 40:01.527
The strength of woman.
that's a sexy fuckin' thing.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.600
You look back at her.

40:03.701 --> 40:07.762
She's so sexy to you now. You're
ready to make another one again.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.932
Your dick start gettin' hard.
and you're looking at her.

40:12.042 --> 40:15.239
You say. "That shit turned me on
like a motherfucker."

40:16.447 --> 40:18.677
But you can't get no pussy
for six weeks.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.948
So now you walking around.
walking around.

40:24.054 --> 40:27.581
You're in the house by yourself. You gotta
go back to the hospital to check on her...

40:27.691 --> 40:30.125
or you stay in the hospital
in another room.

40:30.227 --> 40:33.628
Keep holding your meat in your hand.
You don't wanna beat your meat.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.825
Then you go back down there. And you
check on her a little bit and stuff.

40:36.934 --> 40:40.165
You say.
"Hey. You all right?

40:41.405 --> 40:44.101
Yeah. So it's been a couple
of weeks now. Girl.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.379
Yeah. The doctor say he put
the dissolve stitches in.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.780
He said that there is a chance they
could dissolve before six weeks is up.

40:54.819 --> 40:56.912
Okay. Well. Let me take a look there.
Let me take a look.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.615
Open up. Open your legs.

41:00.991 --> 41:04.290
Does it hurt
when I do like that there?

41:10.835 --> 41:14.327
So you don't feel this at all
right here. Like that there?

41:14.438 --> 41:16.099
You don't feel that?
You don't feel that at all?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.607
I'll wait. Shit!"

41:24.682 --> 41:28.345
Then you can't get titty
for. Like. A year.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.589
Ayear you can't get titty?

41:32.690 --> 41:35.250
How long. Ladies. Is it exactly
that you can breast-feed?

41:35.359 --> 41:38.624
- Five years!
- Somebody say five years?

41:38.729 --> 41:41.857
Five years? Oh. Shit.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.232
That ain't breast-feeding.
That's incest.

41:47.605 --> 41:50.733
You're walking around
with a grown person on your titty.

41:51.842 --> 41:55.005
"He's just a little big
for his age."

41:57.114 --> 41:59.241
That motherfucker draggin' his feet.
sucking titty.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.956
Fuck that.

42:07.057 --> 42:10.083
Man. You can't get no titty
for that long. A year. Whatever. Man?

42:10.194 --> 42:12.185
That's hard.
'cause I'm a titty man.

42:12.296 --> 42:14.560
Ooh. I love the titty.

42:14.665 --> 42:18.066
Mm-hmm. It's all right to applaud
the titties. It's all right.

42:18.168 --> 42:20.500
I don't give a fuck
what size the titties are.

42:20.604 --> 42:24.005
They could be big titties.
Just give me a day to work on them.

42:24.108 --> 42:26.474
'Cause I like to
detail a titty real nice.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.477
You know what I mean?
Oh. I like titties.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.479
Big titties. Small titties...

42:30.581 --> 42:34.415
big nipple titties
or small nipple titties.

42:34.518 --> 42:37.112
You know.
it can't just be a nipple.

42:39.924 --> 42:44.418
Okay? Cause I don't want to feel like
I'm kissing on Earl or shit like that.

42:44.528 --> 42:46.962
But there gotta be a little cushion
up under that nip.

42:47.064 --> 42:51.194
Just a little cushion up under the nip.
then we be all right.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.429
I don't give a damn.
They could be saggy titties...

42:53.537 --> 42:55.937
titties that hang to this side...

42:56.040 --> 42:58.304
titties that hang to that side...

42:58.409 --> 43:00.639
titties that hang over
the fucking back.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.440
The ones that get smushy
when you put your finger in 'em...

43:03.547 --> 43:07.005
and you take your hand off. They still
got fingerprints in the motherfucker.

43:09.019 --> 43:11.817
Stretch mark titties.
I don't give a damn.

43:11.922 --> 43:14.288
I lick between the lines.

43:17.227 --> 43:19.457
Like a stamp.

43:19.563 --> 43:21.531
I likes a titty.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.991
And when you can't get that titty.
you miss it...

43:25.102 --> 43:27.468
'cause the baby
got the titty on lockdown.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.539
Baby at home...

43:29.640 --> 43:33.337
And you see your wife
or your lady laying in the bed.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.505
You see the baby on one titty and you...
"Damn. Why can't I get some of the tit?"

43:37.615 --> 43:39.515
You know there's an extra titty.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.484
You're like.
"I want some. I want some."

43:42.586 --> 43:45.783
You try to ease over there. Get
a little lick of the titty that's open.

43:45.889 --> 43:48.483
"No. Don't do that!"
"Shit. It's a free titty."

43:48.592 --> 43:50.560
"Don't do that!
It's for the baby.

43:50.661 --> 43:53.027
I gotta switch the baby over."

43:54.231 --> 43:56.199
You're looking. Like. "Damn!"
You try to make up excuses.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.236
"Shit. I got stronger jaws. I'm trying
to help suck the milk up for the baby."

44:00.337 --> 44:02.669
"You've been drinking.
haven't you?

44:02.773 --> 44:06.402
Don't do that.
You'll get alcohol on the titty.

44:06.510 --> 44:08.637
You're gonna get the baby drunk.
Don't do that."

44:11.148 --> 44:14.481
And the baby make the titty
look good. Don't they?

44:14.585 --> 44:17.554
Babies show you
what titty's all about.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.056
Babies...

44:25.195 --> 44:27.959
And they look at you
and roll their eyes.

44:40.511 --> 44:44.345
They will fuckin' show you
what a titty is all about. Man.

44:44.515 --> 44:49.179
Those are some of the things you
go through. Man. In this here life.

44:49.286 --> 44:52.744
Round of applause.
all the couples that are married.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.326
Well. Congratulations
to all four of you.

44:59.530 --> 45:03.466
Now. I used to...
I used to be married.

45:03.567 --> 45:06.297
I'm not married no more. We got
a divorce. It just didn't work out.

45:06.403 --> 45:09.395
But it's hard...
You know. When you...

45:09.506 --> 45:12.134
When you say. "I will marry you"
or "Will you marry me?"

45:12.242 --> 45:15.177
that's like saying.
"Oh. Shit!"

45:16.580 --> 45:19.048
That's why they line you up
like fighters and shit.

45:19.149 --> 45:21.049
And guys be looking
at each other. Going...

45:21.151 --> 45:25.588
"You know. When I finish
announcing these vows...

45:25.689 --> 45:28.658
come out swingin'
like a motherfucker...

45:28.759 --> 45:30.784
'cause it's gonna be
a barn burner."

45:32.096 --> 45:35.554
But all this shit happens at first.
getting ready for the ceremony.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.134
And then you gotta
fill out paperwork...

45:38.235 --> 45:39.600
like if you feel as though
you have something...

45:39.703 --> 45:43.969
that you want to be exclusively yours.
you gotta fill out IOU's.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.065
I'm sorry.
I meant "prenuptials."

45:48.078 --> 45:50.774
That's some hard shit. To tell
somebody that you love 'em...

45:50.881 --> 45:54.715
and then the prenuptial comes into play.
but I guess it is what it is.

45:54.818 --> 45:56.911
But a person will do that.
"You know. I love you.

45:57.020 --> 45:58.988
"We about to do
this thing. Girl.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.421
Yeah. Yeah.
We about to get married.

46:01.525 --> 46:04.016
I'm so proud of you.
So glad we can make this happen.

46:04.128 --> 46:06.858
Yeah. You know. What
excites me about this...

46:06.964 --> 46:09.956
is that. For the rest of our lives.
we're gonna be together.

46:10.067 --> 46:13.662
And. You know. That can't
be changed. You know.

46:13.771 --> 46:18.538
And your world. You know.
is gonna be joined with my world.

46:18.642 --> 46:20.701
My world joined
with your world.

46:20.811 --> 46:23.302
And that's a beautiful thing.
We're gonna have one big world.

46:23.413 --> 46:25.313
That's right.
That's right.

46:25.415 --> 46:27.645
That's right.
I love you too. Yeah.

46:32.055 --> 46:35.582
I need you to fill out
this paper that say...

46:35.692 --> 46:38.525
Yeah. I just need you
to sign this here.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.996
It say if your world
fuck up my world. Okay...

46:42.099 --> 46:45.068
you don't get shit
out of my world. Okay?

46:45.169 --> 46:47.899
You just go the fuck on back
to your world."

46:48.005 --> 46:51.634
That's a hard thing to do
with them prenups and stuff.

46:51.742 --> 46:54.643
Let me ask you a question.
Do you believe in the prenuptials?

46:59.716 --> 47:02.184
Okay. Wow!
Y'all believe in that.

47:02.286 --> 47:04.516
Wow. Who don't believe in it?

47:06.623 --> 47:09.990
Overruled. Overruled!

47:10.093 --> 47:12.357
I see you say. "Uh-uh."
You don't believe in that.

47:12.462 --> 47:15.090
That's cool. That's cool 'cause
you believe that if it's love...

47:15.199 --> 47:17.497
let it be pure
and just roll with that...

47:17.601 --> 47:20.365
and let the heart take over
and see what happens.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.370
That's a beautiful thing.
That's a beautiful thing.

47:22.472 --> 47:25.032
So let me ask you...
This is hypothetically speaking here.

47:26.443 --> 47:29.412
Let's say we was getting married
or some shit. Right?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.481
This is hypothetical. Okay?

47:31.582 --> 47:34.483
And coming into the marriage.
going in...

47:34.585 --> 47:38.077
I got 400 million.
let's say.

47:39.189 --> 47:41.680
And that's what
I'm coming in with...

47:41.792 --> 47:45.193
and... you comin' in with a bag.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.233
You still think you should
get some of that 400 mil?

47:52.336 --> 47:54.964
- Half and half.
- Yeah. You be leaving.

47:55.072 --> 47:57.040
"Damn. That's fucked up.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.233
You could put something
in this bag."

48:01.378 --> 48:04.575
I guess I can't answer that.
I guess to each his own.

48:04.681 --> 48:06.581
Fellas. I don't know.
I ain't no doctor.

48:06.683 --> 48:09.379
I ain't no psychologist.
But I'm gonna tell you like this.

48:09.486 --> 48:11.613
If a woman tell you she a virgin
and you gettin' ready to marry her...

48:11.722 --> 48:13.849
test that pussy out
before you marry her.

48:13.957 --> 48:15.857
That's just the way it goes.
Don't do it.

48:15.959 --> 48:18.689
Don't get into it.
and then it ain't what you want.

48:18.795 --> 48:21.195
You never know.
You gotta test that pussy out.

48:21.298 --> 48:23.596
'Cause if you marry 'em
and then get it...

48:23.700 --> 48:26.965
and wind up falling in the pussy.
you'd be. "Oh. Shit!"

48:27.070 --> 48:30.767
You'd be in the land of Oz
out that motherfucker.

48:30.874 --> 48:33.638
"Where the fuck am I?
Is this fallopian? Is this fallopian?"

48:35.712 --> 48:37.680
So you gotta test it out.

48:37.781 --> 48:40.773
It's just like you test-drive
a car or something.

48:40.884 --> 48:43.216
You take a car around the corner.
bring it back to the dealer...

48:43.320 --> 48:45.880
"Naw. I ain't gonna be able
to get this. Cuz.

48:45.989 --> 48:48.014
Yeah. Naw. Naw. Naw. Naw.
Fuck that. Dude.

48:48.125 --> 48:51.219
The wheels. They don't rotate right
on this motherfucker."

48:51.328 --> 48:56.425
Test it out. If you don't check
before you get married. Fuck around...

48:56.533 --> 48:59.434
wind up marrying
a hermaphrodite.

49:01.571 --> 49:04.233
That's right. You thought
that was a big-ass clit.

49:04.341 --> 49:06.866
Turned out to be a dick.

49:08.278 --> 49:11.111
Now you fucked up.
You're..."Oh. Shit."

49:11.214 --> 49:14.206
Can't talk to your boys and shit.
"What's up. Dog?"

49:16.286 --> 49:20.484
"I married somebody with a fuckin' dick
I thought was a clit."

49:20.590 --> 49:22.558
You don't want to do that.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.953
Clit so big.
it looked like a thumb.

49:28.765 --> 49:30.858
So check it out.
Ain't nothin' wrong with that.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.936
Ladies. The same with you.

49:33.036 --> 49:35.436
Don't marry no man that you
don't know what you gettin'.

49:37.274 --> 49:39.674
Yeah. You gotta marry that man.
you gonna know what you gettin'.

49:39.776 --> 49:42.040
'Cause if not.
you marry him and don't know...

49:42.145 --> 49:45.046
you gonna be a bitter housewife on the
phone with your girlfriend. Crying...

49:45.148 --> 49:47.048
"You ain't gonna believe
this shit. Girl.

49:47.150 --> 49:50.551
Damn it. You ain't gonna
believe this shit. Girl!

49:50.654 --> 49:53.452
This motherfucker
can't do nothin'. Girl.

49:53.557 --> 49:56.924
The best thing about it
was the ceremony. Girl.

49:58.028 --> 50:01.156
Ah. Shit!
He noodle dick. Girl."

50:01.264 --> 50:03.232
You don't want
to go through that.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.927
That's why what you do...

50:06.036 --> 50:08.061
you tell the man...
You grab him. Iook at it.

50:08.171 --> 50:11.368
Look at the dick.
Grab it in your hand. Look at it.

50:11.475 --> 50:15.172
You know what I mean?
Hold it. Become the dick.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.172
And look at it.
Look on the head.

50:20.283 --> 50:24.515
Look on the sides.
Look up under the balls.

50:24.621 --> 50:28.113
Look at it and ask questions.

50:28.225 --> 50:31.319
"What's those two bumps
right there?

50:37.134 --> 50:40.467
What's those two bumps
on your helmet?

50:42.439 --> 50:45.408
Well. Have you tried putting
Mercurochrome on that?

50:45.509 --> 50:48.376
No. You haven't. Huh?
Okay.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.644
Why you got a boil
up under your balls?

50:54.918 --> 50:56.886
That is a boil. Okay?

50:56.987 --> 51:00.320
That is not a hair bump.
That is a boil.

51:02.225 --> 51:04.159
Uh-huh.
Okay. Hold up. Wait.

51:04.261 --> 51:06.855
Fuck this.
Hold on. Wait.

51:06.963 --> 51:10.262
Okay. Now you got a boil...

51:11.301 --> 51:14.793
two balls and two bumps?

51:16.006 --> 51:19.305
Uh-uh. I ain't gonna be
able to do it.

51:20.343 --> 51:22.743
No. I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

51:25.549 --> 51:27.676
I am not marrying
no Nutty Buddy.

51:30.187 --> 51:32.883
I'm not gonna be able to do it.

51:32.989 --> 51:36.584
That is too many bumps
on one dick. Uh-uh.

51:36.693 --> 51:39.526
Dick look like a Crunch Bar.
I'm sorry. I just...

51:39.629 --> 51:43.121
I can't do it. I won't do it.
I just won't."

51:49.673 --> 51:54.269
Talk and communicate...
so you know these things.

51:54.377 --> 51:58.711
And so you check... You know what
you're getting and you can be happy.

51:58.815 --> 52:02.080
Make him get butt naked.
Tell your man. "Butt naked."

52:02.185 --> 52:04.085
Tell him to line up right.
Look at him.

52:04.187 --> 52:06.212
Make sure the dick
is in line right.

52:06.323 --> 52:09.724
Make sure it's straight.
Make sure. Okay?

52:09.826 --> 52:11.794
If you don't do that. You'll wind
up marrying a motherfucker...

52:11.895 --> 52:14.125
with a hook in his dick.

52:14.231 --> 52:16.256
Gotta fuck you like this.

52:30.113 --> 52:32.274
You don't want that.
You don't need that pressure.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.079
You should not have to go around
the corner every time he wants to fuck.

52:40.390 --> 52:43.359
"It's just better for my balance.
I got you. You feel me now?

52:43.460 --> 52:46.258
You feel me now. Don't you?
You feel me?"

52:46.363 --> 52:49.161
Chasing you
around the room and shit.

52:51.801 --> 52:55.032
So please. Check all those things.

52:55.138 --> 52:57.663
And then when you're ready
to get married. You get married.

52:57.774 --> 53:00.106
And you're ready
for the ceremony.

53:11.087 --> 53:13.612
Ladies love them ceremonies.
Don't you. Ladies?

53:13.723 --> 53:16.988
You love to invite people you love
and people you hate.

53:17.093 --> 53:21.587
And look at them women that's looking
at you going. "Look at me. Bitch.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.928
Look how I float. Bitch."

53:33.009 --> 53:36.172
And ladies love
to wear that white.

53:36.279 --> 53:38.372
With the veil
and wear that white.

53:39.849 --> 53:41.817
'Cause white
stands for pure.

53:45.655 --> 53:48.556
White. Pure. White.
Come on!

53:49.693 --> 53:53.652
Some of y'all need to be
wearing dark black.

53:55.565 --> 53:57.658
Tease 'em taupe.

53:59.703 --> 54:02.695
Sneaky salmon.

54:02.806 --> 54:05.673
Money green.
All that shit.

54:05.775 --> 54:08.243
Talkin' about wearing white...

54:08.345 --> 54:11.337
knowing they done
fucked the usher last week.

54:11.448 --> 54:13.416
Come on. Now. Wear your color.

54:13.516 --> 54:15.916
That's all I ask.
Wear your color.

54:17.754 --> 54:20.746
Marriage. Man.
It's hard. It ain't easy.

54:20.857 --> 54:22.757
I'll tell you.
One thing I did come to learn.

54:22.859 --> 54:25.760
A lot of people that are married.
you know. Either...

54:25.862 --> 54:30.128
Someone in the marriage
either smokes herb or drinks.

54:33.536 --> 54:36.937
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
That's some true shit. Ain't it?

54:37.040 --> 54:39.941
I got some partners. "Yeah. Yeah.
I got to go home to the wife. Yo.

54:40.043 --> 54:42.705
She get on my nerves every time
I go in that motherfuckin' door.

54:42.812 --> 54:45.940
Yeah. Yeah.
Roll me one of them blunts. Joe.

54:46.049 --> 54:48.779
Roll me one of them motherfuckers.
Yeah. Make that a fat one. Man.

54:48.885 --> 54:51.854
When I smoke that shit. Man. That
bitch look like Janet Jackson. Nigger."

54:55.158 --> 54:58.958
Or they drink. If you check all
the bars. They're mostly married men.

54:59.062 --> 55:02.589
Just look at it. They're mostly married.
and they in there dreading going home.

55:02.699 --> 55:05.759
They in the bar.
"Oh. Shit.

55:05.869 --> 55:09.999
Make me another drink. Earl.
Oh. God. I got to go home to the wife.

55:10.106 --> 55:13.701
Yeah. I don't know. Earl.
You know what? Make it a double.

55:13.810 --> 55:18.509
She wants to fuck tonight. Oh. God.
Well. Here's to her. Oh. God."

55:20.717 --> 55:25.051
They go in the house. "Honey. I'm home."
They start drinking some more.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.055
The in-house drunk
is a motherfuck...

55:27.157 --> 55:29.057
'cause he says things
when he gets drinkin'...

55:29.159 --> 55:31.753
and once that alcohol hits his system...

55:31.861 --> 55:34.796
that he probably
is just out of order for sayin'.

55:34.898 --> 55:38.834
But he don't realize it
'cause he's so drunk. And now...

55:38.935 --> 55:42.871
that liquor taps into his emotions.
and he starts tellin' this woman...

55:42.972 --> 55:45.532
everything he's been wantin'
to say when he was sober.

55:45.642 --> 55:47.610
But he don't have the courage
to say it when he's sober...

55:47.711 --> 55:50.043
and he says it when he's drunk.

55:51.848 --> 55:55.079
"Darlin'. Do me a favor.
will you? Mm-hmm.

55:55.185 --> 55:58.484
Yes. Baby. It's so good.
I'm glad I'm home. Mm-hmm.

55:58.588 --> 56:02.046
Yeah. I think about you all day.
Mm-hmm. I'm glad.

56:02.158 --> 56:06.219
Do me a favor. Never mind all that.
Would you make me a drink. Darlin'?

56:06.329 --> 56:08.627
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Just a little Courvoisier.

56:10.567 --> 56:13.195
Put a little something in that glass
for me right there. Darlin'.

56:13.303 --> 56:15.271
Thank you so much. Baby.

56:17.574 --> 56:19.565
Yeah. That's good Courvoisier.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.170
Make you say yea.

56:25.882 --> 56:29.784
Darlin'. Put a couple of cubes of ice
in there. Cut that warmth off for me.

56:29.886 --> 56:33.481
Thank you. Baby.
Mm-hmm.

56:37.127 --> 56:39.095
That is a good drink there!

56:39.195 --> 56:42.460
That is a good drink there!

56:47.270 --> 56:49.238
That's my drink there.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.008
That is my drink.

57:06.956 --> 57:08.924
Can I ask you something?

57:12.362 --> 57:15.422
When the fuck
you gonna grow your hair back?

57:15.532 --> 57:19.298
I'm tired. Yes. I said.
Yes. Tired.

57:19.402 --> 57:22.428
Uh-huh. You're a bald-headed
little motherfucker.

57:22.539 --> 57:25.770
You told me
you was gettin' the...

57:25.875 --> 57:28.275
the Halle Berry look.

57:30.814 --> 57:32.782
Halle Berry don't look
like that.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.476
I feel like you set me up.

57:37.854 --> 57:39.321
Motherfucker.

57:40.390 --> 57:43.154
I don't give a shit.

57:45.829 --> 57:49.458
Darlin'. Put one more cube
of ice in there for me.

57:49.566 --> 57:51.659
Cut that warmth.
Thank you. Doll.

57:54.704 --> 57:57.172
That was good.

57:57.273 --> 57:59.173
Can I ask you something?

58:00.710 --> 58:05.147
How is it you got more motherfuckin'
shavin' bumps than me?

58:13.957 --> 58:16.551
How you got more?

58:16.659 --> 58:18.650
How is it you got more?

58:18.761 --> 58:22.128
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

58:23.366 --> 58:26.267
Every week. You tellin' me...

58:26.369 --> 58:29.338
you gonna
get your lip waxed.

58:30.540 --> 58:33.441
You might as well just let 'em
take the whole lip.

58:35.245 --> 58:38.009
'Cause that shit
sitting out there like Sasquatch.

58:39.949 --> 58:42.645
Fuck that. Fuck that.

58:42.752 --> 58:45.812
If I wanted to marry Scottie
from the Whisper Bitch...

58:45.922 --> 58:47.890
I would've married him.

58:49.692 --> 58:52.991
Motherfucker. Fuck that.
Fuck that. I said it. Huh?

58:57.233 --> 59:00.760
That's because I feel bad
about it. Girl. Okay?

59:00.870 --> 59:02.838
I said. 'Okay? '

59:05.241 --> 59:09.405
Okay? You didn't
talk to me about it.

59:09.512 --> 59:12.709
When you first gained
five pounds...

59:12.815 --> 59:14.077
that was cute.

59:14.183 --> 59:18.313
I'm-a admit. I'm-a admit that. Okay?
That was cute.

59:18.421 --> 59:21.857
But 75 pounds? Goddamn!

59:21.958 --> 59:24.620
What kind of fuckin' fool
you take me for?

59:26.829 --> 59:29.525
My motherfuckin' ankles
is still swollen...

59:29.632 --> 59:31.998
from the last time
we toyed around.

59:34.337 --> 59:36.965
Look at you.
Oh. God. Look at you.

59:39.042 --> 59:41.442
That is a good drink there.

59:42.779 --> 59:44.747
I remember when I met you.

59:46.416 --> 59:50.648
You was a 115 tender bone.

59:52.021 --> 59:53.989
Yes. You was.

59:54.090 --> 59:58.390
You was the finest thing
my eyes ever seen.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:03.456
You was a round-the-way girl.

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.695
Now you just a big bitch
from up the street.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.773
Goddamn! Huh?

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.667
Motherfucker!

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.507
I don't give a damn.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.548
Don't give a damn.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.549
And I don't like your mother
and your family.

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:24.245
I don't like
none of you motherfuckers.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:28.688
Every year... Every year
we gotta do the family thing.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.691
Everybody brings potluck.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.353
Fuck that! None of you
motherfuckers can cook.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:37.189
And your mother... Tell her to
stay the fuck out of my face.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.029
Always in my face.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:43.537
'How was my macaroni and cheese? '

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.130
It's fucked up. Bitch!

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:51.544
Don't nobody put pasteurized cheese
in macaroni and cheese.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.047
You got to use cheddar.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.942
Cheddar's what you use.

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.952
My mama taught me that.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.133
I don't care!

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.404
I'm looking at you.
and I can't imagine it.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.942
There should be a clause
in my contract that says...

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:25.208
if your ass gets bigger than
what you weighed in when we married...

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.714
I don't have to fuck with you.

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:37.458
Fuck it. Be a man.

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:49.002
You was... When I first met you...
Darlin'. I'm gonna say this.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.505
You were looking good from afar.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.304
Now you're just far
from looking good.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.979
I don't like you...

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.451
and you don't like me. Okay?

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.722
I'm taking karate every day!

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.092
I'm taking kung fu.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.991
I'm taking jujitsu.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:15.223
I'm taking all the martial arts.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.765
I'm trying to master that shit...

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:22.327
so I can figure out how to
choke the fucking life out your ass...

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:25.339
without them tracing it
back to forensics...

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.341
you big bitch. You.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.281
You know what?

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:39.643
Let me put this drink down
before I say some shit I shouldn't say."

01:02:50.597 --> 01:02:54.328
Wow. But you know the ladies ain't
gonna let you get away with that shit.

01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:58.131
You gonna pay the price for that.
You know what I mean?

01:02:58.238 --> 01:03:02.072
'Cause she will wake your ass up.
cuss you out..."Fuck you! Get your ass up!"

01:03:02.175 --> 01:03:05.804
You wake up and you don't even know
why you're up or what happened.

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:10.178
"What's the problem?" "You know what
the problem is. You dirty bastard!

01:03:10.283 --> 01:03:13.184
I got big 'cause I don't
want your ass. Motherfucker.

01:03:13.286 --> 01:03:15.948
You're so ugly.
you look like we got a dog.

01:03:16.055 --> 01:03:19.388
That's what the neighbors think.
you bastard."

01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:20.720
They get angry.

01:03:20.827 --> 01:03:25.389
They will take it in. And they will be quiet
and let you talk shit and all that...

01:03:25.498 --> 01:03:26.897
but they getting you back.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.561
If you ever wake up sore...
I mean. Really fucked up. Hurtin'...

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.629
nine times out of ten you got
your ass whupped in your sleep.

01:03:35.842 --> 01:03:39.107
And the only reason why you didn't
wake up is 'cause you was out.

01:03:39.212 --> 01:03:41.476
That liquor had your ass out.

01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:43.640
They running through
the motherfuckin' house...

01:04:22.522 --> 01:04:24.422
You wake up the next day...

01:04:24.524 --> 01:04:25.582
"My neck!

01:04:25.692 --> 01:04:27.592
My motherfucking neck!

01:04:35.602 --> 01:04:38.070
I don't know what's wrong with me!

01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:40.571
I don't know what's wrong...
This morning...

01:04:40.673 --> 01:04:42.231
What's wrong with me?"

01:04:43.343 --> 01:04:45.140
She just gonna look at you...

01:04:45.245 --> 01:04:48.737
"Maybe you should stop
drinking Courvoisier."

01:04:50.483 --> 01:04:53.611
Be careful. Man.
That shit can happen.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.888
I don't know if you guys
saw the film.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.390
It kind of highlighted my life.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.693
You know. Through it all...

01:05:03.796 --> 01:05:06.321
I come to learn
what I got to do in my life...

01:05:06.432 --> 01:05:11.301
What we all gotta do in our life is ride
this motherfucker till the wheels fall off.

01:05:11.404 --> 01:05:13.668
We gotta live.
Ride it till the wheels fall off.

01:05:15.608 --> 01:05:18.771
You might have looked at the tape.
It said one day I was...

01:05:19.879 --> 01:05:21.779
I was out in the street.

01:05:23.082 --> 01:05:26.745
This is some shit they said about...
They had it highlighted.

01:05:26.853 --> 01:05:29.185
They said I was
out in the street...

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:33.282
and I was yelling stuff
out in the street and doing stuff.

01:05:33.393 --> 01:05:36.294
Listen. Y'all.
I was married at the time.

01:05:36.396 --> 01:05:39.126
Now. I'm not blaming that
for that. Okay?

01:05:39.232 --> 01:05:42.565
But. Okay. At the time...
I'm gonna tell you what happened.

01:05:42.669 --> 01:05:46.571
'Cause that's how they
put their story down. Okay?

01:05:46.673 --> 01:05:48.937
I'm gonna tell it.
But that's how they do theirs.

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:50.600
But. See. L...

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.611
The day that all that went down...

01:05:55.348 --> 01:05:56.940
I'm gonna tell it.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:59.678
The day that all that went down...

01:05:59.786 --> 01:06:03.984
I was married. And the wife asked me to
go to the store to get something to eat.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:08.117
And being the good husband that I am.
I said. "Sure. I'll go."

01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:11.355
Now that I think about it.
I don't know why I was out there...

01:06:11.464 --> 01:06:13.557
getting something to eat
at McDonald's...

01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:17.124
when. As hard as I work. I should've
had a home-cooked fuckin' meal.

01:06:18.237 --> 01:06:19.363
You know?

01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:21.269
But then again...

01:06:21.374 --> 01:06:24.070
I should've asked that question
that day.

01:06:25.178 --> 01:06:27.078
So I go out in the street...

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.081
and I go to run across the street...
I was trying to catch the light.

01:06:30.183 --> 01:06:32.549
I go to run
across the street and...

01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:35.086
because how the light changed. I got
caught in the middle of the street.

01:06:35.188 --> 01:06:39.124
Next thing I know.
they got firemen. They got ambulance...

01:06:39.225 --> 01:06:43.161
they got the police. Everybody out
there with guns... all of'em had guns...

01:06:43.262 --> 01:06:46.595
just because I tried to
run across the street.

01:06:47.834 --> 01:06:51.235
No. I'm fucking with you.
I was higher than a motherfucker. Y'all.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.267
I was high as shit!

01:06:57.377 --> 01:06:59.277
Oh. My fuckin' goodness!

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.745
Oh!

01:07:01.848 --> 01:07:04.749
I was smokin' that ooh-wee!

01:07:06.352 --> 01:07:09.753
That shit done had me
all lunch-box.

01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:14.192
I should have known
something was wrong.

01:07:14.293 --> 01:07:18.525
I start blazin' that shit.
and I knew I started seeing blue smoke...

01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:21.361
but the shit didn't hit me
till I'm walking in the street.

01:07:21.467 --> 01:07:24.527
Some shit said.
"Run real fast right now."

01:07:33.279 --> 01:07:35.440
Fuckin' runnin' in the street!

01:07:35.548 --> 01:07:37.448
Fuckin' with the ooh-wee!

01:07:40.253 --> 01:07:41.880
I'm running like crazy.

01:07:41.988 --> 01:07:44.889
What kind of shit
has the dope man sold me?

01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:50.084
I'm in that motherfucker just
ducking cars. Fucking with the cars...

01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:53.222
jumping out the way.
fucking with the cars and shit.

01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:02.397
Next thing you know.
the motherfucking...

01:08:02.508 --> 01:08:04.942
police and firemen
and the ambulance...

01:08:05.044 --> 01:08:07.911
"Mr. Lawrence. Son. What's wrong?
Calm down!"

01:08:08.014 --> 01:08:11.472
And I'm up there looking at them.
all crazy.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.187
They looking at me.
I'm looking at them.

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.486
I start singing...
How come I feel like

01:08:20.593 --> 01:08:22.685
Somebody's watching me

01:08:23.863 --> 01:08:27.264
I start singing Rockwell
up in that motherfucker.

01:08:27.366 --> 01:08:31.268
I said. "That dope man
done sold me the ooh-wee."

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.997
Oh. Shit.

01:08:33.106 --> 01:08:35.768
I seen all of them. And I thought
my audience had changed...

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:38.776
so I start performing for 'em.
dancing and shit.

01:08:54.093 --> 01:08:55.617
Lunchin'.

01:08:55.728 --> 01:08:56.786
Lunchin'!

01:08:59.698 --> 01:09:01.859
Fuckin' with that ooh-wee. Man.

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:03.959
My damn...

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:06.765
My arm hit my jacket...

01:09:06.872 --> 01:09:09.000
and my jacket flew open.

01:09:09.108 --> 01:09:11.201
And they gonna say I had a gun
'cause my jacket...

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:13.573
I did have a gun.

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:15.169
That's true. I did.

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:17.340
But I ain't have it
to hurt nobody.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:21.147
I just have it 'cause I'm by myself.
I didn't know if somebody would jump me.

01:09:21.254 --> 01:09:23.551
Bang-bang-bang-bang.
Trigger tai chi.

01:09:23.656 --> 01:09:25.850
I didn't know. You know.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.017
But I wasn't trying
to hurt nobody.

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:29.685
Next thing you know...

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:32.923
when they saw that gun.
these motherfuckers loaded up.

01:09:33.032 --> 01:09:36.593
Every one of them... the firemen.
ambulance. Everybody pulled out guns.

01:09:36.702 --> 01:09:40.229
Yes. Sir. And I heard somebody yell.
"Nigger with gun! Nigger with gun!"

01:09:41.506 --> 01:09:42.837
They got ready to fire.

01:09:42.942 --> 01:09:44.773
I passed out like a motherfucker.

01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:51.314
Somebody done fucked around
and sold me the ooh-wee.

01:09:54.787 --> 01:09:56.687
I passed the fuck out. Y'all.

01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.485
And I'm on the motherfuckin'...

01:10:00.626 --> 01:10:03.094
I wake up. I don't know.
ten minutes. Fifteen...

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:05.596
I wasn't countin' time.

01:10:07.066 --> 01:10:09.933
And they had me on a gurney...

01:10:10.036 --> 01:10:12.527
with cameramen and everybody
in my fuckin' face...

01:10:12.638 --> 01:10:15.539
flashing pictures
for y'all to see on the news.

01:10:16.742 --> 01:10:20.109
Then they put me in a...
in a paddy wagon...

01:10:21.647 --> 01:10:23.638
slash-ambulance.

01:10:25.818 --> 01:10:28.150
They want to show
that they cared...

01:10:28.254 --> 01:10:31.280
but I'm lunchin'. So they're gonna
take me to jail or some shit.

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:35.292
So they're ready to take me to jail.
but I'm in there talking shit...

01:10:35.394 --> 01:10:38.830
singing on the bed. Or the gurney.
laying there singing shit.

01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:42.867
That just didn't sound right..."We're
gonna have to take you to the precinct."

01:10:42.969 --> 01:10:44.937
And I'm lunchin' and shit.
and I say...

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:47.437
"Monkeys like to play volleyball."

01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:51.768
I'm laying there...

01:10:51.877 --> 01:10:53.936
"Pit bulls like to wear Jordans."

01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:57.948
That's when they realized
I was sicker than they thought.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:02.350
They said. "He's got something
in his system that got him sick-witted.

01:11:02.455 --> 01:11:05.356
Fuck taking him to jail.
Let's take him to the hospital."

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:07.585
Them motherfuckers
rushed me to the hospital...

01:11:07.693 --> 01:11:10.890
put me in a padded room
with just a big-ass mirror...

01:11:10.997 --> 01:11:13.989
where you could kind of see through...
You knew they was on the other side.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.536
And I didn't help. 'cause I'm
still in there lunchin' and shit.

01:11:18.638 --> 01:11:21.004
Working on moves and shit.

01:11:21.107 --> 01:11:22.836
Two to the right.

01:11:22.942 --> 01:11:24.341
One to the left.

01:11:24.443 --> 01:11:25.842
Think about it.

01:11:27.146 --> 01:11:28.477
Lunchin'.

01:11:28.581 --> 01:11:30.105
Fuckin' lunchin'.

01:11:32.952 --> 01:11:35.352
Then a doctor came in. Y'all.

01:11:35.454 --> 01:11:39.185
He was a fan of the show. And he really
wanted to see me get out of there.

01:11:39.292 --> 01:11:43.661
He said. "Listen. Son. I'm a doctor.
I'm not here to hurt you."

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.823
I'm moving. Can't stay still.
and he's a little nervous.

01:11:46.932 --> 01:11:51.198
He said. "I don't know what happened.
but you almost got yourself killed.

01:11:51.304 --> 01:11:54.296
You were carrying a firearm.
and I don't know what you were thinking.

01:11:54.407 --> 01:11:58.138
But listen. We ran tests.
We checked your blood. Son.

01:11:58.244 --> 01:12:01.645
And we can't find
anything in your blood."

01:12:01.747 --> 01:12:06.150
For a second I was sober...
"What the dope man done sold me?"

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.921
You know. When they can't
find it in your blood?

01:12:12.158 --> 01:12:14.888
So he said. "I wanna help you
get the fuck home.

01:12:14.994 --> 01:12:18.430
I wanna get you out of here
and back to your family.

01:12:18.531 --> 01:12:22.729
But you're gonna have to help me
to help you. That's what you can do.

01:12:22.835 --> 01:12:25.702
I need to know
what you were smoking...

01:12:25.805 --> 01:12:27.773
and who sold it to you."

01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:31.908
I sobered up
for about 30 seconds.

01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:34.878
"I can't tell you that. Doc.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.279
That's a street code. We never tell.
What the fuck you talking about?"

01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:41.980
That's what I told him.

01:12:42.088 --> 01:12:44.352
"You trying to get me fucked up
by the dope man?"

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:48.926
Then it was time for me to go.
'cause I was together.

01:12:49.028 --> 01:12:50.928
The ooh-wee had got
out of my system.

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:54.227
I couldn't believe I was
out on the street lunchin'.

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:57.996
I had the hottest show on. I couldn't
believe these things was happening.

01:12:58.104 --> 01:13:00.698
Marriage was on the brink.
All kind of shit after that.

01:13:00.806 --> 01:13:03.832
But before I left the hospital...

01:13:03.943 --> 01:13:07.879
I got your love. And I felt
your love and support for me.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.379
You know?

01:13:12.418 --> 01:13:15.512
And it was a beautiful thing.
and I thank each and every one of you.

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:17.589
That meant a lot to me.

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:20.853
It truly meant a lot to me.
so I'm forever grateful.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.394
And I tell you...

01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:26.397
celebrities came up to see me
when I was in the hospital.

01:13:26.499 --> 01:13:28.660
It was kinda wild.
They came to see me.

01:13:28.768 --> 01:13:32.431
Magic Johnson came to see me
when I was in the hospital.

01:13:32.538 --> 01:13:35.701
When I was going through one of
my hardest times. He came and said...

01:13:35.808 --> 01:13:37.901
"Martin. What are you doin'. Boy?

01:13:39.178 --> 01:13:44.411
What are you doing out on the street.
doing that crazy stuff like that. Man?

01:13:44.517 --> 01:13:48.283
You gotta take care of yourself.
You got a hot show. Don't blow it. Man.

01:13:48.387 --> 01:13:51.550
You got to be like 'Show time!"'

01:13:52.658 --> 01:13:56.025
That was a beautiful thing
for Magic to give me that advice.

01:13:56.128 --> 01:13:59.620
So since I had him there.
I took the opportunity to ask him...

01:13:59.732 --> 01:14:01.632
to get me on the Lakers.

01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:06.832
And he said. "Sure. Mar.
I'll see what I can do. Mar."

01:14:06.939 --> 01:14:10.841
I know he went home and told Cookie.
"Yeah. That motherfucker in bad shape.

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:15.308
He wanted to take Derek Fisher's job.
I don't know what the fuck he's thinking."

01:14:16.982 --> 01:14:20.008
So finally I got out
of the hospital.

01:14:20.119 --> 01:14:23.282
That was one thing I went through.
I couldn't believe it. Fucked up.

01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:26.256
I said. "Now I got the embarrassment
hanging over me."

01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:29.225
I never really wanted
to go down that way.

01:14:30.029 --> 01:14:32.623
But I had to move on. So...

01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:34.631
I'm trying to get it together.

01:14:34.733 --> 01:14:38.669
Couldn't really go home. 'cause it
wasn't really going so well at home.

01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:41.672
So I did what we all do when we're
trying to get our life together...

01:14:41.774 --> 01:14:43.674
I went to a club.

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:48.845
I'm out that motherfucker. Man...

01:14:48.948 --> 01:14:51.917
I'm at the club dancing. Minding my
business. Doing the ladies dance.

01:14:52.017 --> 01:14:55.748
I'm a little off. Though.
I ain't on the right dances yet.

01:14:55.855 --> 01:14:57.755
I'm still on some old shit.

01:14:57.857 --> 01:15:00.519
And some. You know... I don't know
what this motherfucker was.

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:04.187
He bumped into me. And I said.
"Watch yourself. Partner."

01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:06.196
Then he go and push me.

01:15:06.298 --> 01:15:08.357
I punched that boy in his mouth.

01:15:08.467 --> 01:15:10.799
We rumblin' in there.

01:15:10.903 --> 01:15:12.495
Then everybody clears out.

01:15:12.605 --> 01:15:15.540
I'm rumblin'. Everybody clears out.
Even he cleared out.

01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:18.542
I said. "Damn. I know I can rumble.
but hot damn!

01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:21.204
Shouldn't have started it
if you wasn't gonna finish."

01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:24.214
So he runs out. And then
all these damn cops come in...

01:15:24.316 --> 01:15:27.217
about 30 fucking cops
with shotguns and shit...

01:15:27.319 --> 01:15:29.219
all for little-ass Martin.

01:15:30.756 --> 01:15:33.657
Thirty cops.
You'd have thought I was bin Laden.

01:15:35.361 --> 01:15:39.525
They came in that motherfucker...
"Mr. Lawrence!"

01:15:39.632 --> 01:15:40.894
I fainted again.

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:45.296
How come I feel like
somebody's watching me?

01:15:45.404 --> 01:15:49.135
Next thing you know. They put me in
jail. This time I didn't get off easy.

01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:50.708
They said. "Fuck it.

01:15:50.809 --> 01:15:54.074
On Ventura we didn't take you to jail.
but now we're taking your ass to jail."

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:56.704
When I woke up.
they had me ready to go.

01:15:56.815 --> 01:16:00.842
I knew I was getting ready to go fuck
around with them hardheads up in there.

01:16:00.953 --> 01:16:03.251
I wasn't trying to get them
to come at me right here...

01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:05.255
so I jumped down
and did some pushups.

01:16:05.357 --> 01:16:08.258
I said. "Wait. Officer.
let me do a few of these."

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.920
And I got real "deezed" on 'em.

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.260
My arms was hawked up
a little bit...

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:15.765
so I could go up in that motherfucker
and bang with these niggers.

01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:18.336
"What? What. Nigger. What?"

01:16:18.437 --> 01:16:22.840
So they take me to the precinct
and throw me in the cell by myself.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:27.110
So I'm sittin' in that motherfucker
with the arms all swolled...

01:16:27.212 --> 01:16:29.112
chest all "deezed."

01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:32.615
Nobody to rumble
out that motherfucker.

01:16:34.153 --> 01:16:38.556
They said. "The best way to get back
at Martin... let him stay by hisself."

01:16:38.657 --> 01:16:42.616
The next thing you know. An hour go by.
my "deez" drops a little bit.

01:16:44.363 --> 01:16:47.264
Another hour go by.
and they drop a little more.

01:16:47.366 --> 01:16:51.200
About four hours go by.
I'm holding my arms. Going. "Oh. Bitch.

01:16:51.971 --> 01:16:53.871
I'm sorry!

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.200
He hit me first!

01:16:58.310 --> 01:17:00.210
I'm not an animal!

01:17:00.312 --> 01:17:02.872
I'm not an animal."

01:17:02.982 --> 01:17:05.883
Finally they let me
up out the motherfucker.

01:17:05.985 --> 01:17:10.285
I'm getting ready to get outta there.
thinking I'm going home and shit...

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:12.289
and they hand me a paper
to go to court.

01:17:12.391 --> 01:17:14.120
I go to court.

01:17:14.226 --> 01:17:17.389
The judge I had was this. You know...
he was a cool. Young white dude.

01:17:17.496 --> 01:17:21.694
Didn't take no shit. But straight
to the point. Tell you how it is.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.928
He said. "Martin. What the fuck
are you doing in my courtroom?

01:17:25.037 --> 01:17:27.938
I wanna know why the fuck
are you in my courtroom.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.632
I don't understand that.

01:17:29.742 --> 01:17:34.736
Whoa. Whoa. You mean I go to have
my bagel and coffee this morning...

01:17:34.847 --> 01:17:38.112
I look at the paperwork. And your
fucking name is on my fucking desk?

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:40.981
What are you thinking?
You know what you're doing?

01:17:41.086 --> 01:17:44.351
You're making an ass out of yourself
and you're blowing it. Kid.

01:17:44.456 --> 01:17:45.855
You're blowing it.

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:48.859
You're in a position to do
what a lot of people would love to do...

01:17:48.961 --> 01:17:50.360
and you're throwing it away.

01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:53.397
You're becoming a menace to society.
and it doesn't even make sense.

01:17:53.499 --> 01:17:58.698
Why don't you use all this exposure and
shit to do something positive. Martin?

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.637
'Cause you're in my courtroom.
I will lock your fucking ass up.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.140
I don't give a shit.
I will lock you up.

01:18:04.243 --> 01:18:08.339
Yes. I'm down with the brothers and
the homies. I will lock your ass up.

01:18:08.447 --> 01:18:09.846
Okay?

01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:12.849
I put someone away about a year ago.
His name was Tank.

01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:16.216
He thought he was bad.
Now his name is Tina.

01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:18.881
And Tina's wearing
little tankies. Martin.

01:18:18.991 --> 01:18:22.950
You need to get your shit together
or leave it alone. I'll lock your ass up.

01:18:23.062 --> 01:18:24.962
Okay? Ask Gary Coleman."

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:30.893
I said. "Oh. Shit!

01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:33.995
You're right.
I'll get it together. You're right.

01:18:34.106 --> 01:18:35.869
I'll get it together."

01:18:35.974 --> 01:18:38.204
And he said.
"Not without probation."

01:18:41.113 --> 01:18:43.013
And I said.
"Never again. Never again."

01:18:43.115 --> 01:18:46.676
I said. "Martin..."
I asked myself. I said...

01:18:46.785 --> 01:18:50.881
"How did you go through all that?
How... That's stupid.

01:18:50.989 --> 01:18:54.288
What you have gotten to do
in your lifetime...

01:18:54.393 --> 01:18:56.827
a lot of people would love to do.

01:18:56.929 --> 01:19:00.763
Fortunately. God has blessed you
with a gift to make people laugh...

01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:08.938
and to do some very
special things in life.

01:19:09.808 --> 01:19:12.072
And you come that far
to throw it away?"

01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:14.077
Then it hit me.
I said. "Nah."

01:19:14.179 --> 01:19:18.548
I didn't want to keep jumping on myself
and keep feeling down about myself.

01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:21.244
I said. "Nah."
But then it hit me. You know what?

01:19:21.353 --> 01:19:23.583
I said. "I'm only human."

01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:27.250
If I'm crucified for being a human.
then so be it.

01:19:27.359 --> 01:19:31.455
Because no one is immune
to the trials and tribulations of life.

01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:33.463
No one.

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:37.661
No matter what you do.
you are not immune...

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:39.670
to the trials
and tribulations of life.

01:19:41.373 --> 01:19:43.273
As I got out...

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:45.434
and tried to get myself together...

01:19:45.544 --> 01:19:48.843
I stopped fuckin' with the ooh-wee
'cause it wasn't for me.

01:19:50.048 --> 01:19:51.447
That's a start.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.451
So I got it together.
I kept movin'.

01:19:54.553 --> 01:19:57.613
I said. "Let me get my life together."
and as I'm getting my life together...

01:19:57.723 --> 01:20:00.123
I'm dealing with the motherfuckers
writing bullshit about me...

01:20:00.225 --> 01:20:02.125
saying negative things about me.

01:20:02.227 --> 01:20:07.324
All these devils that
just wanna take God's child out.

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:09.332
Here goes all these rumors.

01:20:09.434 --> 01:20:11.629
Here goes all these rumors
writin' about me.

01:20:11.737 --> 01:20:14.900
I see on the paper.
one of'em says...

01:20:15.007 --> 01:20:19.444
"Martin tries to jump
out of a plane...

01:20:19.545 --> 01:20:22.036
using his jacket
as a parachute."

01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:28.984
As I'm trying to get my life together.
they're gonna write that bullshit.

01:20:29.087 --> 01:20:31.988
I know damn well
you can't jump out no plane...

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:34.490
using your jacket
as a parachute.

01:20:34.593 --> 01:20:37.585
Shit. I know
you got to use your pants.

01:20:37.696 --> 01:20:39.823
They don't think
I know this shit.

01:20:39.932 --> 01:20:41.832
So I said. "Fuck that."

01:20:41.934 --> 01:20:43.335
Then I was trying to get my dating
scene on. Find a lady in my life.

01:20:43.335 --> 01:20:46.304
Then I was trying to get my dating
scene on. Find a lady in my life.

01:20:46.405 --> 01:20:49.033
'Cause I wasn't married no more.
so I'm running around. You know...

01:20:49.141 --> 01:20:53.043
"What's up. Miss lady? How you doin'?"
And they was believing that shit.

01:20:53.145 --> 01:20:56.342
I'd say. "Hello."
They'd say. "Ah. You crazy. Ain't you?"

01:20:56.448 --> 01:20:58.575
Girl. Don't fuck with him.
He crazy.

01:20:58.684 --> 01:21:01.710
That motherfucker probably got a Glock
on him. Don't fuck with him."

01:21:02.487 --> 01:21:06.150
I couldn't believe it.
So then I said. "Fuck the rumors.

01:21:06.258 --> 01:21:09.386
Fuck what they say. Fuck what they
write. 'cause I'm gonna be all right."

01:21:09.494 --> 01:21:11.894
And that's what I did.
I went running.

01:21:13.298 --> 01:21:15.198
I went jogging.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.699
I went running.

01:21:16.802 --> 01:21:19.100
I was trying to
get my mind together.

01:21:19.204 --> 01:21:22.435
I'm out there. I'm running.
and I'm jogging...

01:21:22.541 --> 01:21:25.635
and I'm thinking. "Somewhere
there's got to be a love for me."

01:21:26.745 --> 01:21:29.646
I'm doing my jogging.
listening to the headphones...

01:21:29.748 --> 01:21:31.648
but I happen to go jogging...

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:33.650
on the fuckin' hottest day...

01:21:33.752 --> 01:21:35.913
of the fuckin' summer!

01:21:37.823 --> 01:21:39.586
And a nigger pass out!

01:21:40.692 --> 01:21:42.091
Damn!

01:21:42.194 --> 01:21:44.924
I passed the fuck out.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.328
Lyin' in shit on the lawn.

01:21:48.433 --> 01:21:52.529
Can't believe that. As if I didn't have
enough shit going on in my life.

01:21:52.638 --> 01:21:57.541
Now I'm back on the motherfucking scene
passed out by shit on a lawn.

01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:03.537
Neighbors walking by.
seeing me laying there.

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:05.810
My white neighbors
didn't wanna bother me.

01:22:05.918 --> 01:22:08.785
"Isn't that Martin
laying on his lawn?

01:22:08.887 --> 01:22:11.082
Why doesn't he
go in the house?"

01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:14.522
"I don't know. But that's that
nigger's house. Let him lay there."

01:22:15.928 --> 01:22:19.364
But my lady found me.
She called the ambulance.

01:22:19.464 --> 01:22:23.059
And I'm forever grateful
to her. My family. All of them.

01:22:23.168 --> 01:22:27.195
They was instrumental
in being a part of saving my life.

01:22:27.306 --> 01:22:29.604
But they didn't think
I was here. Y'all...

01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:33.508
'cause I was laying on the ground.
and that sun was frying my head...

01:22:33.612 --> 01:22:36.775
in a skull cap.
in a fuckin' wool-ass hat.

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:40.350
It was fryin' my shit.

01:22:41.553 --> 01:22:45.250
So they think. "Oh. Man!" They checked
my pulse. They couldn't find no pulse.

01:22:45.357 --> 01:22:47.621
My temperature was 10 7.

01:22:47.726 --> 01:22:51.127
So the ambulance drivers leaned over.
couldn't feel the pulse.

01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:53.697
They said. "Fuck it.
This nigger gone.

01:22:53.799 --> 01:22:56.290
You wanna stop
at the liquor store?"

01:22:56.401 --> 01:22:59.165
"Yeah. Pick up some Courvoisier.
Fuck that."

01:22:59.271 --> 01:23:01.739
But they get me
to the hospital on time.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.970
I'm thankful to all of them...
the doctors and nurses. The ambulance.

01:23:06.078 --> 01:23:08.979
But one thing they gonna do... I'm 10 7.
They needed to put me on ice.

01:23:09.081 --> 01:23:13.518
They put me on nothing but ice.
They put ice all over my body.

01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:15.176
Butt naked.

01:23:15.287 --> 01:23:17.118
Damn it!

01:23:17.222 --> 01:23:19.213
Now. I don't mind that.

01:23:19.324 --> 01:23:21.224
I'm hot? Cool me off.

01:23:21.326 --> 01:23:25.228
But I was butt-naked. And I didn't have
the weight in my meat I usually have.

01:23:26.465 --> 01:23:28.660
So I'm out there like this on ice.

01:23:29.768 --> 01:23:32.896
And they around me
taking pictures and shit...

01:23:33.005 --> 01:23:34.836
laughing at me!

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:38.239
I'm gonna fight that in court.
I'm gonna deal with that.

01:23:38.343 --> 01:23:40.743
'Cause somebody could've put
an ice cube under my balls...

01:23:40.846 --> 01:23:42.905
and swolled it up a little
or something.

01:23:43.015 --> 01:23:45.916
Come on. Now.
I'm a black man. Y'all.

01:23:46.018 --> 01:23:47.918
But they didn't do that.

01:23:49.921 --> 01:23:51.684
My family was there.

01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:55.487
The doctors tried to tell them
to go home. They said. You know...

01:23:55.594 --> 01:23:58.722
And I love them and thank them so much
for never giving up on me...

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:02.823
because. Had they gone home. I probably
wouldn't even be here. You know.

01:24:02.934 --> 01:24:04.231
My brother...

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:07.737
Yeah. Thank you.
I applaud 'em. All of'em.

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:09.739
My whole family.
I love 'em.

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:15.305
Yeah. It was rough.

01:24:15.414 --> 01:24:19.544
My brother scared the doctor. 'cause he
didn't wanna hear that. He's military.

01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:22.347
"What the fuck
you talking about? What?

01:24:22.454 --> 01:24:24.979
Nigger. I'm gonna
walk down the street.

01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:28.548
When I get back. Keep talking
that shit you talking. Doc.

01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:32.487
Better pull out a stethoscope.
motherfucker. Or something."

01:24:32.597 --> 01:24:36.897
That's when they started working on me.
Them doctors did all they could.

01:24:37.002 --> 01:24:38.401
And I thank them for that.

01:24:38.503 --> 01:24:42.064
But as much as I thanked them.
I gave God the glory...

01:24:42.174 --> 01:24:43.971
for bringing me back.

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:48.474
I give him the glory.
No question.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.571
I thank him. You know...

01:24:50.682 --> 01:24:54.277
for putting his children
out there around me to help me.

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:57.014
So I woke up three days later.

01:24:57.122 --> 01:25:00.523
Being out for three days
was some of the best sleep I ever got.

01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:04.288
I woke up. Everybody was happy
to see me..."We love you! We love you!"

01:25:04.396 --> 01:25:07.331
"Ain't nothin' wrong
with my hearing."

01:25:07.432 --> 01:25:10.663
I had a tube in my mouth.
I had a catheter in my dick.

01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:13.670
I thought my dick had grew.

01:25:15.107 --> 01:25:17.507
Shit.
It was a damn catheter.

01:25:17.609 --> 01:25:19.600
I didn't know how they
got that catheter in there.

01:25:19.711 --> 01:25:22.612
They couldn't have got that shit in there
if I was woke. I'll tell you that.

01:25:23.715 --> 01:25:26.275
So I had to learn
to talk again.

01:25:26.384 --> 01:25:28.511
I had to learn to walk again.

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.351
I had to learn to do all these things
we generally take for granted.

01:25:32.457 --> 01:25:35.358
It come not so easy.
I had to learn to do that shit again.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.951
My show was running on the air.
I got movies out...

01:25:38.063 --> 01:25:41.089
but I can't go to premieres and shit
because I can't walk.

01:25:41.199 --> 01:25:43.292
Can't do all this shit.

01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:47.861
So I said. "Fuck it.
I gotta work hard to get better."

01:25:47.973 --> 01:25:50.100
So they put me in a room
and gave me a bell.

01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:54.872
They said. "If you need help. Hit this
bell and we'll come in and help you.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.210
The nurse will come help you."

01:25:57.315 --> 01:26:00.148
This catheter was attached
to a tank that had...

01:26:00.252 --> 01:26:02.152
It's where your piss goes.

01:26:03.255 --> 01:26:06.156
One day I tried to get up
and forgot I couldn't walk...

01:26:06.258 --> 01:26:08.385
and the whole piss tank fell.

01:26:08.493 --> 01:26:09.551
I ring the bell.

01:26:12.797 --> 01:26:14.856
"I dropped my piss!"

01:26:18.637 --> 01:26:21.800
So the nurse came in.
and the nurse was fine.

01:26:21.907 --> 01:26:24.740
She was so fine.
you'd go. "Goddamn!"

01:26:25.844 --> 01:26:27.311
She cleaned up the piss.

01:26:27.412 --> 01:26:30.313
This fine. Professional woman
started cleaning up the piss.

01:26:30.415 --> 01:26:34.215
She talked to me and said. "Don't be
embarrassed. This is gonna happen.

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:39.018
But if you think you have to go to
the bathroom or want to try to get up...

01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:41.024
ring your bell and I'll help you.

01:26:41.126 --> 01:26:43.492
But don't try to get up.
all right?"

01:26:43.595 --> 01:26:45.222
I said. "Thank you."

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:47.230
But I forgot.

01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:48.890
Tried it. Piss everywhere.

01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:51.692
"I dropped my piss."

01:26:53.138 --> 01:26:56.266
"Mr. Lawrence. Don't try to get up.
Just ring your bell.

01:26:56.374 --> 01:26:58.365
That's what I'm here for."

01:26:58.476 --> 01:27:02.674
Then one day I was looking at
something on TV. And I laughed.

01:27:03.782 --> 01:27:06.751
And I shitted on myself.

01:27:07.719 --> 01:27:09.516
It was that borderline...

01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:12.181
It was just really
all soft shit...

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:15.259
because I only had
liquids in me.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.329
It just smeared
all around my fuckin' thigh...

01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:21.524
and it was stinkin'
like a motherfucker.

01:27:23.735 --> 01:27:28.172
I was gonna ring the bell. And I said.
"I can't call that fine motherfucker.

01:27:28.273 --> 01:27:32.107
I can't tell that fine motherfucker
that I done shitted on myself.

01:27:33.278 --> 01:27:36.304
I can't tell her.
I know she got a fine friend...

01:27:36.414 --> 01:27:37.813
that know a fine friend.

01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:40.817
All the fine ones
gonna know I shitted."

01:27:42.954 --> 01:27:45.855
I couldn't do it. I'm holding my nose.
I couldn't take it no more.

01:27:45.957 --> 01:27:48.357
It was cuttin' through
my passages.

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.260
"I shitted on myself."

01:27:59.604 --> 01:28:01.834
And this fine woman...

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.430
came in...

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:07.170
and cleaned up the shit.

01:28:07.279 --> 01:28:09.179
She was so patient with me.

01:28:09.281 --> 01:28:13.718
"Mr. Lawrence. I know you're a little
embarrassed. But these things happen.

01:28:13.818 --> 01:28:18.050
Now. I told you. Your bowels...
your muscles are not strong.

01:28:18.156 --> 01:28:20.056
So don't worry about it.

01:28:20.158 --> 01:28:23.321
There's no need to be embarrassed.
These things happen.

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:25.828
This is the hospital.
Don't worry about it."

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.455
And then she started
cleaning me.

01:28:30.068 --> 01:28:32.502
And she cleaned. And she wiped.

01:28:33.605 --> 01:28:36.005
I looked at her.

01:28:36.107 --> 01:28:39.008
This woman was cleaning doo-doo...

01:28:40.645 --> 01:28:42.203
off me.

01:28:43.882 --> 01:28:45.281
And I said...

01:28:47.719 --> 01:28:50.119
I started falling in love.

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:07.966
Now. Man...

01:29:08.073 --> 01:29:12.100
that was a beautiful thing
for them to do... for her to do.

01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:16.510
After that. I shitted maybe
seven more times. I would say.

01:29:16.614 --> 01:29:19.845
Went from hard shit to doodle balls.
all kinds of shit.

01:29:19.951 --> 01:29:21.942
Shit with corn in it.

01:29:22.053 --> 01:29:23.543
And she cleaned it up.

01:29:23.655 --> 01:29:26.783
About the tenth doo-doo.
she was madder than a motherfucker.

01:29:26.891 --> 01:29:29.359
All that professional
went out the window.

01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:31.361
"All right. Mr. Lawrence!

01:29:31.463 --> 01:29:33.954
Now. This shit
don't make no sense!

01:29:34.065 --> 01:29:36.329
You too grown for this shit!

01:29:36.434 --> 01:29:40.336
You been in this hospital all this time. And
you ain't worked your fuckin' muscles yet?

01:29:40.438 --> 01:29:43.271
Shittin' all over the place.
That's just not cute.

01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:47.277
And you gonna act like you wanna get
with me. I don't want no shitty man.

01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:52.374
Talkin' about 'Martin! Martin! '
Should be Shitty Martin."

01:29:55.086 --> 01:29:58.317
Scared me so bad.
I just stopped shittin' for a while.

01:29:59.524 --> 01:30:00.752
Didn't do nothin'.

01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:04.386
I think she quit after that. They said
she was gone. Couldn't find her nowhere.

01:30:04.496 --> 01:30:07.897
Said she couldn't take the shit
off Martin no more. She was tired of it.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.992
I think I shitted one more time.
and I just sat in that.

01:30:12.103 --> 01:30:14.003
"I will not tell nobody."

01:30:14.105 --> 01:30:16.505
And the whole room was funky.

01:30:16.608 --> 01:30:20.908
It was so stinky. "Fuck it.
My pride won't let me tell nobody.

01:30:21.012 --> 01:30:23.344
'Cause I don't want them
to get angry with me no more."

01:30:23.448 --> 01:30:27.145
I tied a pillowcase around my head
and around my nose...

01:30:27.252 --> 01:30:28.742
and cut out the eyes.

01:30:28.853 --> 01:30:32.254
I was in there looking like
a shitty superhero.

01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:45.266
And then they motherfuckin'
came in the room and shit.

01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:48.271
You know. They could smell.
'cause it was messing up the hospital.

01:30:48.373 --> 01:30:50.466
They thought they was gonna
have to quarantine the hospital.

01:30:50.575 --> 01:30:53.908
They found it was me sittin' in shit.
and I started blaming people.

01:30:54.012 --> 01:30:55.411
I was in denial.

01:30:56.848 --> 01:30:59.715
"There's a serial shitter
going around.

01:30:59.818 --> 01:31:02.446
He broke in
and put the drawers on me.

01:31:02.554 --> 01:31:04.647
He went that-a-way."

01:31:07.492 --> 01:31:09.483
But one thing I can say...

01:31:09.594 --> 01:31:12.495
honestly. Truly from the heart
that I learned...

01:31:12.597 --> 01:31:15.862
from. You know. Ventura...

01:31:15.967 --> 01:31:20.063
the gun. Assault. Whatever...
fights and coma and all that.

01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:22.366
One thing I truly learned...

01:31:22.474 --> 01:31:25.068
is that we fall down...

01:31:25.176 --> 01:31:26.803
but we get up.

01:31:27.979 --> 01:31:29.241
Thank you.

01:31:33.985 --> 01:31:36.385
Will all the people
who like sex...

01:31:38.957 --> 01:31:41.357
All the people
who like safe sex.

01:31:43.294 --> 01:31:46.058
Sex is good.
I love sex.

01:31:46.164 --> 01:31:48.689
That's a good thing. Isn't it?
I love sex.

01:31:49.834 --> 01:31:51.734
I love everything about it.

01:31:51.836 --> 01:31:53.736
Just not all the crazy stuff.

01:31:53.838 --> 01:31:56.238
Ladies. I love that oral sex.

01:31:57.342 --> 01:32:00.243
I love when you do me.
I really do. I really do.

01:32:01.913 --> 01:32:03.972
You gotta soak. You know.

01:32:04.082 --> 01:32:06.983
If I'm gonna do that.
you gotta clean it well.

01:32:07.085 --> 01:32:10.418
Because. Guys. If you ever caught
a bad one. That shit will scar you...

01:32:10.522 --> 01:32:13.013
for the rest
of your fucking life.

01:32:13.124 --> 01:32:15.524
You ever go down
and it smell like...

01:32:17.595 --> 01:32:19.529
you will be fucked up.

01:32:21.466 --> 01:32:24.026
Shit smell like. "Oh. No."

01:32:24.135 --> 01:32:27.366
So if you clean it right.
we don't have to go through that.

01:32:27.472 --> 01:32:31.067
'Cause. Ladies. You don't like a man
with a stinky dick. Am I correct?

01:32:31.175 --> 01:32:33.837
You would let a man know
in a minute.

01:32:33.945 --> 01:32:36.243
"Your balls stink.

01:32:36.347 --> 01:32:38.907
Your balls stink!"

01:32:39.017 --> 01:32:42.316
I got a woman right now
suing me.

01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.388
No. Not 'cause of stinky dick.

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:48.755
She gonna say I gave her
high blood pressure...

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:51.260
'cause I had salt on my balls.

01:33:01.539 --> 01:33:04.940
I said. "I thought you liked your meat
seasoned. Baby. What's the problem?"

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.770
But sex is good.
Sex is good.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.007
Do it when you get the chance
to do it. Have fun.

01:33:11.115 --> 01:33:13.276
Make love. Let it blossom.
but do it right.

01:33:13.384 --> 01:33:17.252
That weird sex shit? Who is out here
doing that weird sex shit?

01:33:17.355 --> 01:33:18.982
Who's doing that?

01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:21.183
Stop that shit.
You know who you are.

01:33:21.292 --> 01:33:22.691
Pissing on people?

01:33:23.995 --> 01:33:26.395
That is not lovemaking.
Stop getting that...

01:33:27.999 --> 01:33:29.432
"You like that?

01:33:29.534 --> 01:33:32.992
Let me drink two more cups of water.
and I got a little more for you."

01:33:34.772 --> 01:33:36.467
Cut it out!

01:33:36.574 --> 01:33:38.769
Cut out doing
that weird sex shit.

01:33:38.876 --> 01:33:42.073
And whoever is doing
that S&M. Stop it.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.775
Listen. If you wanna do a little
something. You just gotta be gentle.

01:33:45.883 --> 01:33:48.317
Is it called S&M... S&M?

01:33:48.419 --> 01:33:50.512
I don't do it.
so I don't know.

01:33:50.622 --> 01:33:53.614
Listen. Ain't nothin' wrong
with a little pop on the ass.

01:33:53.725 --> 01:33:56.785
I'm a pop-on-the-ass man.
I know how to do it though.

01:33:56.894 --> 01:33:59.124
I been trained for that
and everything.

01:34:00.365 --> 01:34:02.356
They show you how
you're supposed to do that.

01:34:02.467 --> 01:34:05.265
One leg here.
the other leg here.

01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:08.737
When you pop.
you come up off it like that.

01:34:09.507 --> 01:34:12.067
See? That means you're not
actually trying to hurt 'em.

01:34:12.176 --> 01:34:15.509
You're just trying to make them
feel that sting.

01:34:15.613 --> 01:34:18.514
But when you pop
and plow 'em into the fucking wall...

01:34:19.884 --> 01:34:21.784
then it's starting to get brutal.

01:34:21.886 --> 01:34:23.820
You don't want that.
That's brutal sex.

01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:26.412
You don't wanna
pull your dick out...

01:34:26.524 --> 01:34:30.085
and then drop your foot
on the back of their neck.

01:34:30.194 --> 01:34:33.925
You don't wanna take hot curlers
and burn their stomach.

01:34:34.032 --> 01:34:36.262
Talkin' about.
"You love me? You love me?"

01:34:36.367 --> 01:34:39.268
That's just not
what you wanna do.

01:34:41.439 --> 01:34:45.637
I seen some white boy tell his lady.
"Kick me in my balls real hard.

01:34:45.743 --> 01:34:47.540
Right now."

01:34:49.113 --> 01:34:51.513
"Fuck. Yeah! Yeah!"

01:34:53.618 --> 01:34:57.816
I seen a lady have her nipples
clamped to the door...

01:34:57.922 --> 01:35:00.117
and have somebody slam the door.

01:35:00.224 --> 01:35:02.852
"Oh. Yeah! Yeah!

01:35:07.799 --> 01:35:10.131
Now take 'em off the hinges
and throw the doors.

01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:12.395
Yeah! Yeah!"

01:35:13.504 --> 01:35:15.096
So please...

01:35:15.206 --> 01:35:16.571
be gentle with that.

01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:21.236
And who is puttin' gerbils
in their ass?

01:35:21.345 --> 01:35:23.176
Stop it!

01:35:23.281 --> 01:35:25.772
Them gerbils ain't done
nothin' to nobody.

01:35:25.883 --> 01:35:28.909
Them little rodents ride that wheel.
you snatch 'em. Put 'em in your ass.

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.921
Stop that.
I hope they scratch your ass out.

01:35:33.091 --> 01:35:36.117
Hope you wind up in a hospital
sounding like a Chinese movie.

01:35:36.227 --> 01:35:38.127
"Doctor! Doctor!

01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:40.288
The rodent's up in my ass!"

01:35:40.398 --> 01:35:43.299
Scratch his ass out. Little rodent.
Scratch his ass out.

01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:48.400
You know the doctor gonna tell you.
"I can get him out.

01:35:48.506 --> 01:35:51.339
But first you're gonna have to
fill out some paperwork."

01:35:51.442 --> 01:35:54.434
"Hurry up. Doctor!
Hurry up. Doctor!"

01:35:56.681 --> 01:35:58.649
So please...

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:01.480
be cautious with your sex.
be gentle with your sex.

01:36:01.586 --> 01:36:04.248
Be gentle with your lovemaking.
Love one another.

01:36:04.355 --> 01:36:05.413
Another thing. Fellas.

01:36:05.523 --> 01:36:07.548
Have you ever...

01:36:07.658 --> 01:36:09.922
been doing it so good...

01:36:10.027 --> 01:36:12.188
so wonderful...

01:36:12.296 --> 01:36:14.093
The mood is right.

01:36:14.198 --> 01:36:15.597
The lights are dim.

01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:19.067
It's probably dark...

01:36:19.170 --> 01:36:23.334
but not quite dark.
'cause your bodies. They silhouette.

01:36:23.441 --> 01:36:25.636
You can see each other.

01:36:25.743 --> 01:36:30.146
The music is going. It seems to be
going with your emotion and your flow.

01:36:30.248 --> 01:36:32.546
Everything's working that night.

01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:34.049
"Ooh. Girl.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:38.120
Why you do this to me. Girl?

01:36:39.223 --> 01:36:41.123
Oh. That is so nice.

01:36:41.225 --> 01:36:44.217
It's so moist. So wet.

01:36:45.096 --> 01:36:47.963
Wow. It's so hot."

01:36:48.065 --> 01:36:50.727
And you're going.
"My goodness. Girl.

01:36:50.835 --> 01:36:52.962
You just so wet.

01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:55.470
What. You gettin'
extra wet for me tonight?

01:36:55.573 --> 01:36:58.235
Extra. Extra. Extra?"

01:36:58.342 --> 01:37:02.369
All over you. You can feel it
all over your thighs. Everywhere.

01:37:05.817 --> 01:37:07.717
Then you get up
and you cut on the lights.

01:37:07.819 --> 01:37:09.787
Blood every-fucking-where.

01:37:16.427 --> 01:37:18.486
It looks like a fucking massacre.

01:37:24.936 --> 01:37:29.532
You look at your dick like
it's a knife. "Why? Why?"

01:37:31.342 --> 01:37:34.971

It looks like a crime scene.

01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:39.909
"Why? Why. Why. Why?"

01:37:41.686 --> 01:37:44.052
You look at her.

01:37:44.155 --> 01:37:46.885
"Why didn't you tell me?"

01:37:46.991 --> 01:37:48.390
Ladies got the perfect answer.

01:37:48.492 --> 01:37:50.790
"You must have brought it down!"

01:37:51.729 --> 01:37:52.957
God bless.

01:37:53.064 --> 01:37:55.589
Ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

01:37:56.305 --> 01:38:02.575
