WEBVTT

00:19.040 --> 00:20.000
Turn on the light.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.800
-Is anyone in there?
-The paramedic.

00:31.160 --> 00:31.920
Okay wait a minute

00:33.480 --> 00:34.240
What do you have there?

00:34.360 --> 00:35.280
A thirty-five year old.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.280
He was transported
with a ruptured appendix.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.360
Early sepsis.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.960
Blunt injuries to the
head, chest and abdomen.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.040
Over with him now.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.400
-Who is this?
-The pilot.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.400
How is she doing?

00:44.520 --> 00:46.040
Serious facial
injury, neck bleeding.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.360
Cannot intubate because
of blood in the mouth.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.640
The car will explode.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.320
As a basketball team doctor,
I take care of the injuries.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.160
Everything from
blisters to broken bones.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.280
Great.  Sports.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.720
Aren't you impressed
with the talent it takes?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.080
Basketball is not my thing.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.160
But if Tony Hawk gets
the 900 degree, I'll be there.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.120
Do you really want this job?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.520
Are you kidding?  It
looks great on the résumé.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.520
And there is extra money.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.040
If you're that interested,
you better listen.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.440
If you are one of those interns

01:23.560 --> 01:24.920
who will help me, you will too.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.440
And you also get one
of these cool jackets.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.920
It says "team doctor
assistant" on it.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.480
Who is he talking to?

01:34.960 --> 01:36.880
With the director
of Waverly Athletic.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.360
Angus showing him around?
How do they know each other?

01:39.920 --> 01:42.520
It must have been his dad.
Incomprehensible.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.280
Do you have any questions
about the program?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.560
Forgiveness.  Rorish.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.680
This is Willis.
You have to cut that short.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.920
I was on the way in the emergency vehicle.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.880
Yet again?  You need a hobby.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.560
Pot on lid.
I'm sending you a disaster.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
What a disaster?

01:55.120 --> 01:57.080
One patient was
evacuated from a cruise.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.800
The helicopter crashed.
I'm sending you two by bus.

02:00.040 --> 02:00.960
We will be prepared.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.560
Doc!

02:02.680 --> 02:04.520
We are ready!  He is conscious!

02:08.720 --> 02:09.759
What's your name?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.160
Brad.  Brad Souza.
I'm the medic on board.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.760
-Is my patient alive?
-He's on his way to the Angels.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.920
What about my pilot, Debbie?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.600
I don't know how,
but she saved us...

02:20.720 --> 02:22.520
I'm worried about
you, understand?

02:22.760 --> 02:24.240
It's pretty stuck there.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.160
The fire flares up again!

02:28.400 --> 02:30.200
What kind of offensive
strategy do you have in mind?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.240
-Motion or Triple Post?
-The one my team wins.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.560
You have no idea
about basketball, do you?

02:35.680 --> 02:37.680
We don't play for the
team when we get the job.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.840
We'll be doctors.
I think I can do it.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.920
Leighton, Savetti,
talk about sports later.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.320
You need to focus on this.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.200
These are the first two victims
of the rescue helicopter crash.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.200
Thirty-five year old
with a ruptured appendix.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.000
Blunt injuries to the
head, chest and abdomen.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.480
He is hypotensive and hypoxic,
blood pressure is 74 to 46.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.120
Can I have my cell phone?
I have to call my wife.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.040
I left her and my 8
year old on the boat.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.720
Sir, you can call her
when we've stabilized you.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.280
A forty year old, blood
pressure is at 90 to 52.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.360
Her name is Debbie.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.000
Serious facial injuries,
post nasal intubation on site.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.000
I see.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.640
The oxygen saturation
drops, it is around 85.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
Let's take them to
the Center Stage.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.680
All right, Debbie, we have you.
Where is Dr.  Willis?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.920
Still on site.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.040
Okay, please.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.480
It is firmly fused
with the seat.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.560
Fine, I'll cut out his seat.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.080
We take the whole thing with us.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.360
All right?  Come on!

03:47.840 --> 03:49.200
What's happening?  What are you doing?

03:50.400 --> 03:51.760
We'll get you out of here.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.960
I'll give you some morphine.
That will help.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.200
What about Rowan?
The patient?  His family?

03:59.320 --> 04:01.160
I promised him that
he would see her again.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.280
You will keep your promise.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.520
The thing is leaking fuel.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.240
Fast.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.360
Fast fast.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.520
The lungs are free.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.320
But ventilation becomes difficult.
The saturation is low.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.920
Your inner tracheal tube
may have slipped out of place.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.520
Your jaw is dislocated.
He presses the breathing tube shut.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.760
Put it on so it doesn't
bite your thumb off.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.240
The saturation is down to 72%.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.160
Okay, we can do it, Debbie.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.560
Male, in his forties, 3rd
degree burn on his back.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.600
He was fused with the
seat and is the medic.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.720
Calls the combustion ITS.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.440
We couldn't separate
him from the chair on site.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.920
We have to operate it slowly.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.960
Very slowly.
Let's stabilize it.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.840
Why do you always attract anger?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.800
Good question.  How is she doing?

05:03.920 --> 05:06.160
-Stable enough for the operating room.
-I'll bring them up myself.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.240
Got it.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.160
Diffuse pressure sensitivity
and defense tension.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.520
The belly is full of blood.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.680
He has to go to the operating room.  Fast!

05:14.800 --> 05:16.280
Arms are burned.
I can't get access.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
He needs an esophagojejunostomy.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.720
We'll take care of you, Brad.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.600
-Do you know him?
-Yes.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.360
The two have been flying
patients to us for years.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.560
He has breathing problems.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
The burns extend from
the back to the chest

05:27.400 --> 05:28.360
and prevent breathing.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.400
He cannot dilate his lungs.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.440
-Fascia split.
-Yes.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.520
Dr.  Kean, we need
to separate the chair

05:34.640 --> 05:36.120
from the back and
cut through the burns.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.520
To do this, he has to go to the operating room.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.120
Risa, please call
Incineration ITS.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.280
They are already on their way.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.040
The saturation is down to 74.
Shall we intubate him?

05:45.320 --> 05:46.280
That won't help.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.240
We have to remove the
chair or it will suffocate.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.040
So much too
"slowly and carefully".

05:53.080 --> 05:53.880
What do we have here?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.240
Debbie, the helicopter pilot,
collapsed in the elevator.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.240
Hamman sign.  Air loss.
We have to open it!

06:05.400 --> 06:07.120
Pulse oximetry says 64%.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.800
You take off the
chair, I open my chest.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.640
-I need betadine.
-I can hardly ventilate him.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.720
-You need to work faster.
-He collapses.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.400
Come on, Brad.  Stay with us.
We're almost there.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.160
-He will be separated soon.
-Scalpel.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.880
On my side too.  Let's pull.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.280
One two Three.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.760
I've reached the subcutis.

06:34.880 --> 06:35.960
The values ​​improve.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.560
The pulse is strong.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.080
He's not over the hill yet.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.400
Let's put it on and take
it to the incineration ITS.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.800
Your daughter threw
a stapler at my son!

06:48.920 --> 06:51.600
-Is she crazy or what?
-No she is not.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.120
Your son laughed at
your daughter's clothes.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.240
He annoyed her.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.840
Okay, but who ended
up in the hospital?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.400
-Your daughter belongs in custody!
- Relax, sir.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.600
Take care of yourself.
Just sew the wound up.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.360
-Dad...
-All right, son.  I will solve that.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.840
No, I mean my head
is about to explode.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.640
And my eye is totally blurry.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.640
-I beg your pardon?  What's happening?
-I'm going to take a closer look.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.240
-That hurts?
-Yes, insane.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.920
What's happening?
Talk to me right away!

07:18.040 --> 07:19.840
It might not be anything,
but we need to do a CT.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.640
We will pay for that!

07:23.760 --> 07:25.440
-Mom can we go?
-April, please...

07:25.560 --> 07:26.640
Go, I'm serious.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.240
No, it's expensive.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.400
Medical bills are expensive,
I'll sue you for everything.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.120
Dr.  Dixon, are
you under control?

07:34.240 --> 07:36.080
-I try it.
-Who are you?

07:37.160 --> 07:39.320
The head of the emergency
room and chief of surgery.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.280
Hey buddy.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.000
What does this patient
need, Dr.  Dixon?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.920
A CT scan of the brain and eye socket.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.320
Make that happen.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.520
- Doctor Rorish.
-Thank you.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.720
-Debbie didn't make it.
-I am sorry.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.760
She was the first
female pilot I ever met.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.000
I have to call her parents.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.800
What do you want to do with Brad?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.760
I'd like to tell him
if you don't mind.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.040
You are practically part of the family.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.760
That should help with the pain.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.039
We spoke to the surgeons.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.919
The good news:
the appendix is ​​out.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.000
And the bad one?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.400
You have a serious
stomach injury from the crash.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.680
We had to remove a
long piece of your bowel.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.840
Oh my God.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.400
We are watching
you carefully, but you

08:50.520 --> 08:53.320
should know that
complications can arise.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.120
I can't tell my wife that,
she worries too much.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.920
Rowan, thank goodness.
Are you all right?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.080
Yes sweetheart.  I am fine.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.800
My appendix was
removed, but I'm fine.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.160
Is jason with you

09:11.720 --> 09:13.440
Dad, when are you coming back?

09:13.640 --> 09:17.640
Not soon, buddy.
But I am taken care of.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.600
Hey, don't you want to be a doctor?

09:22.240 --> 09:25.520
How about I get you
a fancy stethoscope?

09:25.640 --> 09:26.720
This works out?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.160
Hey, give me one more mommy.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.360
How much did you give him
He should be in more pain.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
One milligram of Dilaudid.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.640
Intravenous?  Do you want
to lower his blood pressure?

09:37.760 --> 09:38.520
He's fresh out of the operating room.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.160
What is your problem?
His blood pressure is good.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.160
True, but he might still
have drugs in his blood.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.920
His D-dimer is increased,
could be an embolism.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.600
And you could have stray herpes,

09:46.720 --> 09:47.960
but I guess you don't have one.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.000
What's wrong with you?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.760
How do you know the
head of sport at Waverly?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
Oh my God.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.440
Through your dad, right?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.800
I can not believe that.
This is what this is about

09:58.160 --> 09:59.960
I have the same right
to the job as you do.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.320
I had to fight for
everything I achieved in life.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.880
-You never fought.
-What are you saying?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.120
Your dad.  You've
always had it easy

10:08.240 --> 10:09.520
in life and I've
always had it difficult.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.400
Hey is there a problem?

10:13.320 --> 10:15.040
-No.
-No.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.320
Then stop arguing
in front of the patient.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.800
Not just in front of the patient.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.120
May I have one of
these stethoscopes?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.160
I see what I can do

10:29.320 --> 10:30.680
-No no.
-One two Three.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.080
Girls between 8 and 10
found alone in the mall.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.080
Very upset.
Wheezing and slight hypoxia.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.680
Your oxygen saturation
continues to decrease.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.600
Well i'm going

10:43.880 --> 10:47.080
Take it easy.
Head injuries or fever?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.160
No, the police are looking
for their parents right now.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.360
You should fix them four times.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.640
What's going on here?

10:53.160 --> 10:54.760
We won't fix a child fourfold!

10:58.800 --> 10:59.920
Oxygen is at 86%.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.600
Has she already eaten
or drank something?

11:01.720 --> 11:02.800
-Does she have any medication?
-No.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.560
Hey where are your parents

11:12.200 --> 11:13.280
You don't have to be afraid.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.080
We put the mask
on you so that you...

11:23.240 --> 11:25.120
I have to put the mask
on you so that you...

11:27.600 --> 11:29.480
She can hear us,
she just doesn't react.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.600
Zoe!  Zoe?  Mommy's here baby

11:33.280 --> 11:35.720
Is she OK?  I lost
her.  She ran away.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.600
-I can calm you down.
-OK.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.520
She has to be ventilated.
Can you put it on her?

11:41.640 --> 11:42.360
Thank you.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.200
She is autistic.  She doesn't
get along well with strangers.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.080
-Just put them on...
-Don't worry, I know that.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.760
It's okay.  So...

11:54.440 --> 11:57.040
She must have pneumonia.
It would be the 4th time this year.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.320
She has asthma attacks in a panic.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.640
Have they been tested
for sickle cell anemia?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.680
Naturally.  She doesn't have it.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.840
What is the distance
from L.A. to Dallas?

12:09.960 --> 12:13.720
The distance between L.A.
and Dallas is...

12:13.840 --> 12:14.560
1040 nautical miles.

12:14.680 --> 12:18.720
She is talking on the
cell phone.  She repeats

12:18.840 --> 12:20.880
what's on TV and sometimes
with her stuffed animals.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.000
But she never speaks to me.

12:25.200 --> 12:30.120
She is 9 and never said a
word to me, not even "Mommy".

12:32.080 --> 12:34.440
One two Three...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.880
Oh god no  She counts
when she is in pain.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Where does it hurt?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.600
No idea.
It points to several places.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.320
But when it radiates
or comes in waves...

12:41.440 --> 12:43.160
I do not know.  It just counts.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.880
-OK.
-...two three four...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.040
How is she doing?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.520
I saw that you
could ventilate her.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.880
And she is so strong.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.760
-Brad...
-I know her.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.360
She really wants to
work again, like me.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.320
Brad.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.240
I'm so sorry.
Debbie died in the operation.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.960
Everyone survives in my head.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.960
What do you mean by that?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.960
I'll throw it on your roof, fly
away and don't look back.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.120
In my thoughts...

13:48.520 --> 13:49.920
... live on.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.400
And what about the
patient, the appendix?

13:58.720 --> 13:59.680
It's stable.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.320
We do what we can.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.440
Will you keep me updated

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
I promised him that he
would see the family again.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.480
I know.  We shouldn't
make promises.

14:13.920 --> 14:14.880
No.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.640
But we all do it.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.080
Dad, you have to come back.
You miss everything.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.120
I know buddy.  But
see what I found.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.320
I'll be able to hear
your heartbeat soon.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.720
In any case.  I promise.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.320
The CT shows bleeding behind the

14:37.440 --> 14:38.960
right eye, pressing
on the optic nerve.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.680
Why are you telling me that?
It is not my eye.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.840
True, but... I...

14:43.960 --> 14:46.040
I thought I could use some help.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.400
The boy is strong.  Maybe
you should talk to him.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.320
Dr.  Dixon, I pretend
I didn't hear this.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.800
Dealing with patients
is part of being a doctor.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.280
You either do the whole
job or nothing at all.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.120
I understand that as "No."

15:09.440 --> 15:12.040
Once implanted, the
neurostimulator sends

15:12.160 --> 15:16.120
electronics to different
areas of the brain

15:16.240 --> 15:18.360
and so relieve the symptoms
of Parkinson's disease.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.480
This is called a deep
brain stimulation surgery.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.120
Like a pacemaker for your brain.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.160
Yes, I heard about it.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.760
And have you done it before?

15:30.880 --> 15:34.080
A few times.
With different results.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.600
There is no guarantee
that it will work?

15:41.560 --> 15:43.560
Or that I will survive
the operation?

15:43.680 --> 15:45.880
There are risks, yes.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.960
You know that.  But it
seems promising for you.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.120
And that's rare.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.960
Not everyone is an option.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.080
Before the operation there
are first laboratory tests.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.640
We'll have it done today.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.400
-No.
-Rollie...

15:59.520 --> 16:00.640
The time window is tight.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
You are now a good candidate,
but I don't guarantee...

16:02.880 --> 16:03.960
-I am not ready.
-Rollie...

16:04.080 --> 16:05.240
No means no.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.560
Thank you.
I appreciate your time.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.760
-An operation?
-Yes.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.360
-Are you kidding?
-No.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.840
Will I get well again?

16:21.960 --> 16:24.960
Quiet.  If he gets the
surgery, will he be fine again?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.880
There is a possibility that
the damage will be permanent.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.360
What does this mean?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.240
He could go blind in the eye.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.440
What?

16:32.640 --> 16:34.560
We'll have to wait
and see how he'll react.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.200
His operation is
planned in two hours.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.680
Two hours is too long.
You're operating on him now.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.440
Listen to me  Listen.
You're operating on him now!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.280
Sir, we'll operate
on him in two hours.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.160
If you don't calm down
slowly, you won't be

16:48.320 --> 16:50.800
there anymore because
I'm calling the guards

16:50.920 --> 16:52.320
that you're going
to get out of here.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.120
What's up

16:57.240 --> 16:59.600
She doesn't respond.  Looks
like ventricular tachycardia.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.040
No.  It's torsade de pointes.
She needs magnesium.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.599
Enter immediately.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.400
Are you feeling better now?

17:20.520 --> 17:22.319
Your heartbeat is irregular.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.760
So she also has heart problems?

17:24.920 --> 17:26.079
How does she eat like that?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.359
What does that matter?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.760
Poor nutrition can cause
cardiac arrhythmias.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.560
-And she's very thin.
-She eats well.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.360
I want a CAT scan
of your abdomen.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.000
One has already tried
that, she does not hold still.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.240
We could easily sedate
her, but that carries risks.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.040
Especially with an
irregular heartbeat.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.680
You are like everyone else.
They just tell rubbish.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.480
You don't know anything either!

17:46.600 --> 17:48.440
Why don't you do
your job and heal it?

17:53.200 --> 17:55.440
One two...

17:57.960 --> 18:00.480
three four...

18:01.680 --> 18:03.880
five, six...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.360
I wish you could
tell where it hurts

18:11.320 --> 18:14.880
How warm is it in Dallas, Texas?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.440
The temperature in
Dallas is 38 degrees.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.720
Do you wear a jacket

18:22.880 --> 18:24.800
I don't wear jackets.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.400
Then you will freeze.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.720
She chats a lot
when you feel like it.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.960
Do you know a lot
about technology?

18:36.080 --> 18:38.720
I was born in '92, I'm
sort of an astronaut.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.880
Good.  I have an idea.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
It doesn't slow down.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.000
Twice red blood cell
concentrate after cross-matching.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.520
-What's happening?
-He's bleeding all over the place.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.800
Give him plasma and do
another coagulation test.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.960
His blood no longer coagulates.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.760
The accident caused
DIC syndrome.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.560
Isn't that usually fatal?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.600
Usually.  Not always.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.320
I told Angus that his
D-dimer was elevated.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.400
That always happens with
DIC syndrome, doesn't it?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.040
What about his wife?

19:08.160 --> 19:09.720
The boat is due to dock tomorrow.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.200
He doesn't have time until tomorrow.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.560
Somebody has to go up to the helipad.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.080
See if a helicopter
is available.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.160
For what?

19:18.680 --> 19:21.400
So that a father can see his
family before he dies.  Come on!

19:27.200 --> 19:29.920
It probably won't survive
more than a few hours.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.120
He should see his
family one last time.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.560
And they're on a cruise ship?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.000
Over three hundred
kilometers away.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.280
I want to send a
rescue helicopter.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.840
It's an expensive
cab ride, Leanne.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.360
What if we need the
helicopter for patients

19:44.480 --> 19:45.440
when it is transporting
passengers?

19:45.560 --> 19:46.720
I've already thought about that.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.640
One is ready on the
roof, it is fully fueled.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.560
-And I should pay that?
-For the final farewell.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.280
-It's a good deal.
-Sorry, Leanne.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.800
What would you do about the
last time to see your daughter?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.560
What would that be worth to you?

20:04.920 --> 20:07.040
My responsibility
rests with the hospital.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.600
The answer is no.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.320
I'm glad you're awake.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.320
What is happening with me?

20:33.120 --> 20:36.080
You have something
called DIC Syndrome

20:36.560 --> 20:39.160
disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.240
That doesn't sound good.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.200
This means that we
cannot stop your bleeding.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.160
Your body uses up the
coagulation factors faster,

20:50.640 --> 20:52.120
than that we can
give you new ones.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.880
So will i die?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.720
We'll do everything we can.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.560
But at this stage it
is seldom reversible.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.280
How much time do I have?

21:14.400 --> 21:17.600
Because my wife is coming,
she is still a day away.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.800
You just have to hold on.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.720
VOXTEXT: VOICE SIMULATION APP

21:32.840 --> 21:34.000
Almost finished.  Sorry

21:34.120 --> 21:35.200
The internet is slow here.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.520
What are you doing again?

21:36.640 --> 21:39.200
A voice simulator on Dr.
Install Willis' cell phone.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.760
When he speaks in, it sounds
like the Englishwoman of her choice.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.040
-Here, try it.
-Call her.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.920
She still has to
answer the phone.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.360
That will be up to her.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.800
Your call was
forwarded to voicemail.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.720
Call until she answers.

22:11.840 --> 22:12.920
Like the girls in high school.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.360
Hopefully I'll get
better results here.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.080
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.760
How are you?  How do you feel?

22:54.720 --> 22:57.000
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

22:58.160 --> 22:59.120
No.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.840
-What's happening?
-What's happening?

23:05.280 --> 23:08.120
She is actually talking to you.
I can not believe it.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.160
-I feel bad.
-Where does it hurt?

23:19.440 --> 23:23.480
How is the weather
in Tokyo, Japan?

23:23.600 --> 23:25.440
I need to know what the
weather is like in Tokyo, Japan.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.440
-Say you search the net.
-Search the net...

23:28.920 --> 23:30.000
Search the net...

23:30.920 --> 23:33.840
The weather in Japan.
It's 32 degrees.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.480
You should put on a jacket.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.560
-I do.
- I do.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.280
This could take a while.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.960
Rorish wanted the helicopter,
but Campbell said no.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.040
-What was that about?
-What?

23:52.160 --> 23:54.880
- "His D-dimer was increased"?
-He was.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.400
There can be a
million reasons for this.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.360
Having a cold can also
increase D-dimer levels.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.840
-And a DIC syndrome.
-But you didn't say that.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.160
Neither of us thought so.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.600
We thought it was
increased by appendicitis.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.880
You have no idea
what I was thinking.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.960
You wanted to look good
and I should be a sucker.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.080
-You are acting wrong.
-Do you feel threatened by me?

24:13.320 --> 24:15.920
It is not about you that is
threatening to me, Angus.  Nothing.

24:16.240 --> 24:21.160
Now stop.  Right away.
You both follow me.  This way.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.600
Are you kidding?  Come?

24:25.920 --> 24:26.880
What happened?

24:28.280 --> 24:30.320
They got along
so well for so long.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.320
-He's got...
-Callate.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.720
This is my house.
I do not tolerate this behavior.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.720
They act like those chickens.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.200
Which chicken?

24:40.840 --> 24:43.360
The super-egg
layers were separated

24:43.520 --> 24:44.960
from those who
only laid one or two.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.040
Do you know what happened?

24:47.120 --> 24:48.080
No.

24:49.600 --> 24:54.000
When you came back
the usual group was okay.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.840
And the super hens?

24:57.240 --> 24:58.920
They picked themselves to death.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.680
Your job here is hard enough.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.000
You don't have to
excel but work together.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.880
Otherwise you'll end up like
a bunch of dead chickens.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.280
The neuro-ophthalmologist
is very good, don't worry.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.600
I wait outside.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.520
He is ready.

25:27.880 --> 25:28.840
Thank you.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.840
Dad why are you such an asshole?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.120
See you later.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.280
Am i an asshole

25:50.640 --> 25:53.040
No, you are... you are loud.

26:07.920 --> 26:08.880
I run a lot.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.560
One and a half kilometers, every day.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.040
It's a long walk.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.440
-That is a lot.
-That is a lot.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.520
Yes.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.920
Except when I'm
not feeling well.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.360
-Like now?
-Like now?

26:25.640 --> 26:26.440
Yes.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.200
Where does it hurt?

26:35.840 --> 26:39.120
One two Three...

26:40.760 --> 26:41.720
...four...

26:48.640 --> 26:50.960
Can you tell us where it hurts

26:51.080 --> 26:52.160
Can you point to it

26:52.280 --> 26:56.240
Can you tell us where it
hurts  Can you point to it

26:56.680 --> 26:59.240
She points to her upper abdomen.
Left of the center line.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.760
This can be the pancreas,
the spleen or your stomach.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.400
Angels headquarters.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.280
This is Life Bird One speaking
on a humanitarian mission.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.680
We'll be there in
about six minutes.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.480
His blood pressure is dropping.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.520
The heart rate is down to 55.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.840
We can no longer
control the bleeding.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.040
Damn it.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.400
They better hurry up.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.960
Your values ​​deteriorate.
The fever rose to 39.6.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.720
Put a drip and give more liquid.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.120
Please save my baby
You're welcome...

28:00.720 --> 28:03.640
Acute pancreatitis.
We need the results.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.600
I have a crazy idea.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.360
She has minimal weight,
probably due to malabsorption,

28:09.480 --> 28:12.360
and pancreatitis and
pneumonia are factors.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.760
-What is that?
-Cucoviscidosis.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.080
-I agree.
-Only it comes in handy

28:17.200 --> 28:18.320
never before with African Americans.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.360
One in 15,000.
That's why they were never tested.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.920
How bad is cystic fibrosis?

28:23.600 --> 28:25.040
Not as bad as uncertainty.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.360
It's a sweat test.
You know in a few hours.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.720
Start your usual cystic
fibrosis treatment.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.200
Breast physiotherapy
and expectorant.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.520
However low the risk
is, it has to be someone.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.560
Dr.  Rorish, his family is here.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.480
Oh god, Rowan!

28:43.600 --> 28:44.560
Dad!

28:45.480 --> 28:47.680
-Mrs.  Davis?
-What's happening?

28:51.440 --> 28:56.240
Dr.  Leighton, will you take
Jason to the machine, please?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.800
No i want to stay!

29:02.840 --> 29:06.400
Honey, daddy is resting.
Get a snack, yeah

29:07.280 --> 29:08.240
Come over.

29:10.520 --> 29:11.320
Thank you.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.680
When does he wake up again?

29:16.160 --> 29:17.120
We do not know that.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.520
Will he wake up?

29:26.840 --> 29:27.800
We do not know that.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.320
We can only...

29:32.000 --> 29:32.960
...to hope.

29:33.080 --> 29:33.920
And wait.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.000
What am I telling Jason?

29:38.800 --> 29:43.000
He can't live without
his dad, neither of us can.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.760
That's one thing I didn't miss.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.360
We can help people
who are doomed to

29:58.480 --> 30:00.640
die, but no one can
make decent coffee.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.360
How are you my friend?

30:09.480 --> 30:10.600
I'm better

30:12.280 --> 30:16.320
Jesse, sorry for putting
you in this position.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.280
-Come on.
-No Please.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.360
I want to get rid of this.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.000
I'm not a doctor anymore, Jesse.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.720
You wanted me to
face it, talk to Campbell.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.920
But I didn't want to hear.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.880
I should have tried harder.

30:31.280 --> 30:34.800
I can be very
convincing, and for

30:34.920 --> 30:36.480
the record, you will
always be a doctor.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.880
No, it would take
a miracle for that.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.320
Anyway, I've heard that a
miracle is waiting for you.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.960
The op?

30:47.360 --> 30:48.560
Who told you

30:48.680 --> 30:50.640
Big Brother is nothing
against Big Mama.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.200
I have a huge
network of spy nurses.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.760
-Is it already planned?
-No not yet.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.120
Why not?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.560
I'm not ready.

31:03.640 --> 31:06.360
What do you mean by that?
This is a lottery win...

31:06.480 --> 31:08.360
I am not ready, Jesse.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.720
Why not?

31:13.320 --> 31:14.960
I still have a few things to clarify.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.840
Do not hit me.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.840
-What do you want?
-I don't know, I...

31:38.040 --> 31:39.120
I...

31:41.000 --> 31:41.960
I know.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.720
My dad wanted me to do it.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.000
He called me every
day to talk about it.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.640
I guess I kind of
liked his attention.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.920
But it doesn't last long.  He
has a short attention span.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.640
You are the new one.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.240
If a junkie loses his
dealer, he needs a new one.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.840
Mike is out of town,
now your dad has you.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.480
Thanks Mario.
I feel much better right away.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.600
I am not saying that
he does not love you.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.680
I say he is who he is.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.880
And you shouldn't let him
convey anything to you.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
You deserve recognition
for your achievements.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.280
Your dad didn't make
you a good doctor.

32:30.000 --> 32:30.800
That was you yourself.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.720
Did you just call
me a great doctor?

32:34.840 --> 32:36.560
-I said "good".
-I think you said "great".

32:36.680 --> 32:38.440
-And I'm really touched.
-I think I'll take it back.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.360
Too late.  I am the
best doctor you know.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.440
Keep your mouth shut.

32:49.800 --> 32:50.960
What are you doing here?

32:52.280 --> 32:53.640
I invited both of them.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.160
-Are you all right?
-What?  My eye?

33:01.560 --> 33:02.840
Yes, it's fine again.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.440
I am sorry for yelling at you.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.560
It's a habit and I
need to improve.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.440
You could have ducked.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.440
You threw it at
100 million km / h.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.280
Can i see your eye

33:34.240 --> 33:35.200
Clear.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
She is doing very well.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.640
That's a good sign.
She is definitely calmer.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.080
OK.

33:57.640 --> 33:58.720
I have some answers.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.560
It was a bad inflammation of
the pancreas, it's getting better.

34:02.680 --> 34:03.520
And...

34:05.040 --> 34:07.800
We were right.
She has cystic fibrosis.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.880
Incredible that with
everything she already has

34:17.760 --> 34:19.520
she also has to endure that.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.560
Why is she so unlucky?

34:24.719 --> 34:26.199
There are extremely good drugs out there.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.800
A CFTR potentiator.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.360
That keeps the slime in check.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.400
It only helps people
with a certain mutation,

34:33.520 --> 34:37.080
maybe 5-6% but for them
it makes all the difference.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.480
That sounds like a
very low probability.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.560
Your daughter had a
1:68 chance for autism,

34:42.679 --> 34:45.480
and 1 in 17,000
for cystic fibrosis,

34:47.440 --> 34:48.760
your marker is positive.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.600
She can take the drug.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.280
She is one in a million.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.560
Yes, she is special.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.960
She hit another jackpot.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.840
She has you as a mom.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.600
What's this?

35:12.120 --> 35:13.080
Give them a call.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.280
Will I sound like
the Brit on the app?

35:16.400 --> 35:18.480
No app, just you.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.920
See what happens.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.920
Hello...

35:42.560 --> 35:43.520
Zoe...

35:44.840 --> 35:45.800
How are you?

35:50.080 --> 35:51.840
You don't sound like the cell phone.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.680
You sound like my mommy.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.640
I am...

36:05.880 --> 36:07.280
I am your mommy

36:10.600 --> 36:13.120
It's me.  I am your mommy

36:26.600 --> 36:27.560
Sasha...

36:32.600 --> 36:33.640
Come with me.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.120
Dad!

36:49.560 --> 36:50.520
Are you...

36:59.680 --> 37:00.560
He's fine.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.960
Suddenly his inflammatory
reaction slowed down.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.640
That is rare.  That's very rare.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.560
Rowan is the unlucky
fellow with the greatest luck.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.400
I had too much to live for.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.680
Oh mate.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.760
There, look.  As I promised you

37:24.240 --> 37:25.200
How do i sound

37:25.720 --> 37:26.680
Extremely loud.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.360
You can bet on it.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.720
What the hell did you do?

37:45.640 --> 37:48.960
I resisted you.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.000
-You wasted resources.
-It wasn't a waste.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.680
I think it made
all the difference.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.000
What?

37:56.120 --> 37:58.800
There is no medical reason
that the man is still alive.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.240
But he's alive.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.360
You are a better
doctor than you think.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.120
I know exactly how good I am.

38:05.360 --> 38:08.120
But medicine is
not just science.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.960
This man was about to die.

38:12.360 --> 38:17.400
Then his son came, touched
his hand and he lived on.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.120
Is that your excuse?

38:23.760 --> 38:24.720
I'm not sorry.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.440
You will have to fire me.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.560
Yeah, I might do that.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.440
Tomorrow.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.240
I'll fire you there.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.680
Incredible that you
hijacked a helicopter today.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.440
Please, you've already hijacked
emergency vans for a taco.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.520
You were there,
don't you remember?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.480
No, I don't even remember that.

38:59.920 --> 39:04.080
Not looking, two nervous
interns at two o'clock.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.320
Want to know who I
picked for the Waverly job?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.160
-For us everything is okay.
-No matter how.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.080
Good.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.120
Because I've already
made my decision.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.720
Team doctor
assistant Dr.  Noa Kean
