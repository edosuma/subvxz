WEBVTT

00:14.480 --> 00:15.731
MAYOR:
The people who depend on us

00:15.780 --> 00:18.305
are expecting us to make
the tough choices.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.648
Which is why,
with all due respect,

00:20.680 --> 00:23.183
I believe,
in the let century,

00:23.220 --> 00:25.108
it takes _more
than a Village,

00:25.150 --> 00:26.310
it takes a city.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.419
And in the case of New York,

00:28.460 --> 00:29.654
the greatest city on Earth.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.726
WOMAN: Yes.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.421
Yes!
MAN: Well said.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.791
That's New York!
MAYOR: Thank you.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.388
Thank you for your
continued support.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.728
And a special thank you
to Ron Skinner

00:38.770 --> 00:40.192
for hosting this event.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.435
Please, buy one of
his apartments.

00:42.470 --> 00:44.529
But if you don't,
you can always donate

00:44.570 --> 00:46.777
the $80 million
to my campaign.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.472
You know, I looked at
one of these apartments.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.114
It wasn't for_ me--
not enough wmdows.

00:56.150 --> 00:59.187
SKINNER: I think you can see
around you why Skinner Plaza

00:59.220 --> 01:01.359
will soon establish itself

01:01.390 --> 01:04.723
as Manhattan's preeminent
"glamortech" address,

01:04.760 --> 01:08.423
so please, grab a Blu-ray
prospectus on your way out.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.860
And for God sakes,
make me an offer.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.165
CARRIE:
Can we have another--

01:16.210 --> 01:17.302
what was I drinking,
whiskey?

01:17.340 --> 01:18.739
Carrie, may I say
how lovely you look.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.579
Oh! Well, thank you, Eliot.

01:20.610 --> 01:21.429
And your plus one.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.778
Why, thank you Eliot.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.675
I believe that's
the closest you've ever come

01:25.710 --> 01:27.610
to delivering
a genuine compliment.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.618
Easy, Jo, it was
anything but genuine.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.186
Okay, why don't you two
just kiss and make up?

01:33.220 --> 01:34.482
Did you guys
hear the mayor?

01:34.520 --> 01:35.555
He insists we show up

01:35.590 --> 01:36.625
and then doesn't even
acknowledge MaJor Crimes.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.424
Yes, but he did take credit
for all of our work.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.553
Ah, well, I suppose getting
a shot at Ron Skinner's

01:41.600 --> 01:44.797
legendary Bordeaux
collection is worth it.

01:44.830 --> 01:48.869
Well, that, and these
fabulous crumbly things.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.164
I think we should
be honored

01:51.210 --> 01:52.472
that the mayor
invited us.

01:52.510 --> 01:53.431
"Should" being the
operative word.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.209
The truth is, you're right--
I wouldn't want

01:55.240 --> 01:56.798
to be trapped in a room
with either of them

01:56.850 --> 01:58.147
for more than
four minutes.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.341
Excuse me. Hello?

02:00.380 --> 02:01.369
Yes...

02:02.520 --> 02:03.817
How's life at Chez Skinner?

02:03.850 --> 02:05.511
CARRIE: There's still hope
for some excitement.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.711
Eliot okay with
Webster taking my place?

02:07.760 --> 02:11.218
Yeah! You know how
Eliot and Jo love each other.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.659
You know, if I bail now,
I could be there

02:12.700 --> 02:14.349
in 15 minutes.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.355
CARRIE:
No, you can't.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.367
You're the groomsman, Al.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.867
I know you want
to rub elbows with the mayor,

02:17.900 --> 02:21.358
but your loyalty is with
Peter and Lacey today.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.903
Going solo to this wedding
was a big mistake.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.306
I'd make you dance with me
if you were here.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.228
Aw. But I don't dance.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.941
Okay... I guess I'll
just have to dance

02:29.980 --> 02:31.470
with Lacey's sister Andrea.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.319
AL:
She's had a little crush on me

02:33.350 --> 02:34.544
for a while, if you recall.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.512
You remember her?

02:35.550 --> 02:37.916
Of course you remember her,
she's beautiful.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.383
Even I remember her.

02:40.590 --> 02:41.852
Carrie?

02:43.860 --> 02:47.489
Al is very sad that he is not
here for all the hobnobbing.

02:47.530 --> 02:48.895
And it's killing you

02:48.930 --> 02:50.625
that he didn't invite you
to the wedding.
Not true.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.921
I don't like weddings.
And I do believe

02:51.970 --> 02:53.631
that men_ and women
can be Just friends.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.831
Yeah, and with hard bodies
and great hair like you two--

02:55.870 --> 02:57.406
oh, no, you cannot.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.702
Uh-oh.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.504
Oh, here comes Tom and Jerry.
Here they come.

03:01.540 --> 03:03.599
You must be the
crime-fighting superhero

03:03.650 --> 03:05.242
that Eliot was
telling me about.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.316
No, I'm just the coroner,
but I get that a lot.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.238
Welcome to my building.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.246
Ron Skinner.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.780
Oh! Carrie Wells.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.809
Hello.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.509
How about the private tour?

03:15.560 --> 03:16.686
I'd love it!

03:16.730 --> 03:17.685
The more the merrier.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.551
Actually, we-- we're going
to get going soon.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.726
We gotta work.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.625
And, uh, but,
we'll take a rain check.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.298
Carrie, you... you really
should take this opportunity

03:26.340 --> 03:28.661
to get to know one of
the city's great benefactors.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.978
I'll take the express tour.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.648
Great.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.814
Ellie, you are shameless
forcing that jerk on Carrie.

03:42.850 --> 03:45.944
The mayor approves
our budget, Joanne.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.787
Which means he pays
for those electrons

03:47.820 --> 03:48.980
_in that electron
microscope of yours.

03:49.020 --> 03:49.987
Aha. Yeah.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.679
And Skinner
pays for the mayor.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.322
Mm-hmm. Okay.
It's as simple as that.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.851
That being said, go save her
in three minutes.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.561
That man is a pig.

03:58.830 --> 04:02.766
And this is where the
magic happens, as they say.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.437
Is that what they say?
The magic, huh?

04:04.470 --> 04:06.529
What are you going to do,
pull a rabbit out of something?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.808
Hah!
Ha,ha!

04:07.840 --> 04:10.604
No, y are
the real magician here.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.878
CARRIE:
Oh, well...

04:11.910 --> 04:14.811
Go ahead-- dazzle me
with that memory of yours.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.044
What do you know about me?

04:16.080 --> 04:17.741
You don't need me...
Please.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.350
Show me your gift.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.652
Okay.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.782
Ronald Skinner,

04:22.830 --> 04:23.979
married Olivia Francis

04:24.030 --> 04:26.590
May 1997;
divorced April 2000.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.791
Married again in 2002,
divorced again in 2005.

04:28.830 --> 04:32.834
Married Melody in 2009 and
divorced Melody in, well, 2009.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.667
The Post reported
the reason for

04:34.700 --> 04:36.804
your disharmony was
infidelity-- yours.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.068
Again.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.737
Hmm.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.772
You know, I'm on the lookout
for my next bride.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.607
Oh!

04:44.650 --> 04:46.572
I miss married life.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.713
See, I think...

04:48.750 --> 04:50.388
you miss cheating.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.739
Fiery. I like that.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.758
Uh-oh, careful--
your neighbors will see.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.782
Uh,no".
uh,nolookey400key.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.457
I spent millions in

04:58.490 --> 04:59.650
state-of-the-art
security wmdows.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.827
Meaning what?

05:01.860 --> 05:05.728
Meaning... Ivalue
my privacy, Carrie.

05:05.770 --> 05:06.862
Oh.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.767
And I think we should take
advantage of that privacy

05:09.810 --> 05:11.562
while we have the chance.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.931
You're lucky I'm unarmed.

05:17.010 --> 05:20.673
You... I'm gonna
show you something.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.747
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.417
All right.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.188
WEBSTER: $80 million
for an apartment,

05:27.220 --> 05:28.915
and I have yet
to find a bathroom.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.428
So, Joanne, Ronald
here, was, um...

05:31.460 --> 05:33.690
just finishing up his tour.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.789
SKINNER:
In fact, I was...

05:35.830 --> 05:36.728
finished.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.897
You two can show yourselves out.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.535
Was it something I said?

05:44.570 --> 05:45.867
Great event.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.673
All good things must
come to an end, Ron.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.075
Ellie and I gotta
be heading out.

05:49.110 --> 05:50.509
Quite a place
you got here.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.448
It's a little cramped.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.947
My team's
waiting downstairs.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.574
Oh, hold on, Mr. Mayor,
I'll head down there with you.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.780
Ellie.

05:56.820 --> 05:57.980
Thanks.
Thank you for coming.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.556
_ WOMAN: _
Nice to see you, snr.
And you.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.855
(mellow Muzak playing
over speakers)

06:04.890 --> 06:06.699
Really nice event, Ron.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.823
You can cut the crap, Mike,
and tell me you'll take care of

06:08.860 --> 06:10.828
my air rights
problem in SoHo.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.497
And you know I can't
tell you that.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.589
The Board of Estimates
is up my butt on that.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.835
Hello! Mike!
I just raised a half-mil

06:17.870 --> 06:18.837
for you in there.

06:18.870 --> 06:19.973
You need to at least tickle my--

06:20.010 --> 06:22.069
With all due respect--
Mr. Skinner,

06:22.110 --> 06:25.546
the mayor has fast-tracked
every permit you applied for.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.047
That's some serious tickling.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.741
Aren't you the slippery one.

06:32.590 --> 06:36.082
So much for the most
high-tech building in New York.

06:37.490 --> 06:38.980
Oh, great.

06:40.830 --> 06:41.956
He's been studying up.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.194
Oh.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.663
MAN: Sit down!

06:44.700 --> 06:45.792
That was a gunshot.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.889
Yeah, I know the caterers
were bad, but still, this is--

06:47.940 --> 06:49.931
My phone's completely crashed.

06:49.970 --> 06:52.200
Well, mine, too.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.834
We have to go see
what's going on.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.709
CARRIE :
Let's go.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.458
Eliot?

07:10.690 --> 07:12.794
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Well, hello, Mr. Policeman.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.457
What's happening?

07:14.500 --> 07:19.631
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Five, four, three, two, one...

07:19.670 --> 07:20.864
Enjoy the ride.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.571
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
$100 million in 60 minutes,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.815
or I drop them
the rest of the way.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.760
Building's locked down,

07:51.800 --> 07:53.768
security gates are lowered,
all entrances sealed.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.234
ESU reports no sign of
security guards or doormen.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.500
Bad guys have taken control
of the building.

07:58.540 --> 07:59.905
And according
to these records,

07:59.940 --> 08:01.032
Skinner's the only resident
of the building.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.001
Doesn't open till spring.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.201
Any word from Carrie and Jo?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.603
Most of the guests
left the party.

08:05.650 --> 08:06.674
We don't know who's
still in there.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.017
Any idea who's doing this?

08:08.050 --> 08:09.938
We're in the dark.
No visual on the perps.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.946
Jay...

08:11.990 --> 08:13.582
who could hack into
both Skinner's building

08:13.620 --> 08:15.281
and the NYPD system?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.958
Someone who's got skills,
sophistication,

08:16.990 --> 08:19.220
and a big set of freakin' stones
to go after the mayor.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.659
Dangerous trifecta,

08:20.700 --> 08:22.019
but it gives you
somewhere to start.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.096
All right...
Five? Thanks.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.028
Eliot's being
held up there,

08:25.070 --> 08:26.958
maybe Carrie and Jo, too.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.797
We're not losing anyone today.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.060
I'm sure she's
all right, Al.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.878
Get down!
You! Shut up!

08:39.750 --> 08:42.139
You heard him--
don't move!

08:42.180 --> 08:43.147
MAN: I'm gonna
stay by the door.
MAN 2: Get down!

08:43.190 --> 08:44.214
Bring 'em in here!

08:44.250 --> 08:45.979
_ _ Come on! _
This ain't mu5ical chairs!

08:46.020 --> 08:47.317
Sit on the floor!
Sit down!

08:47.360 --> 08:48.315
Let's go!

08:48.360 --> 08:49.622
Come on, people!
Come on!

08:53.700 --> 08:55.053
Keep your mouths shut!

08:55.100 --> 08:57.261
Nobody else has to get hurt.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.632
WEBSTER : It looks
like one of the caterers.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.262
Shoulder wound.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.035
MAN: Security guards
and doormen

09:05.070 --> 09:06.571
are all locked up
downstairs.

09:06.610 --> 09:07.872
Ike's watching the lobby.

09:09.310 --> 09:11.904
Look, that's an
awful lot of blood.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.077
It could be the
brachial artery.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.918
By shooting that guy, they are
saying take us seriously.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.178
MAN: Andrew's dealing
with the package.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.154
Good. Sweep upstairs
for stragglers.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.055
Let's go.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.274
Shh.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.259
ELIOT: Well, I suppose getting
a shot at Ron Skinner's

09:57.290 --> 09:59.588
legendary Bordeaux collection
is worth it.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.697
CARRIE : Please be
the same as the wine cellar.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.697
Please be the same.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.638
Yes.

10:07.670 --> 10:08.967
Come here. Go, go.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.149
(mellow Muzak
playing over speakers)

10:30.190 --> 10:32.078
Who's after me, Eliot?

10:32.130 --> 10:33.154
Please...

10:33.200 --> 10:34.929
I'm the one they're after.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.894
My guys get threats
like this every week.

10:36.930 --> 10:37.897
Really?

10:37.930 --> 10:39.261
Like this

10:39.300 --> 10:41.768
Well, I really appreciate
you asking us over, Ron.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.759
Okay, so,
who is it, terrorists?

10:45.810 --> 10:48.233
No, we will not negotiate
with terrorists.
Oh, please.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.100
Save it for the
press release, Mike.

10:50.150 --> 10:54.177
So, I'm just supposed
to pony up $100 million?

10:54.220 --> 10:55.312
Okay, slow down,
both of you.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.818
We need to figure out who
we're dealing with first.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.818
Great, no service.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.283
MAN :
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.981
Apologies for the inconvenience,
but there's business

11:04.030 --> 11:05.884
to take care of.
Mr. Skinner,

11:05.930 --> 11:07.352
if you are indeed interested

11:07.400 --> 11:09.152
in "ponying up my tab,"
as you say,

11:09.200 --> 11:10.792
feel free to call.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.139
There's a cell phone
in the call box that works.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.730
And, yes, I can hear everything
you say in there.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.068
Now, Mr. Delson,
I consider myself fortunate

11:18.110 --> 11:20.032
you chose to ride
with your two friends.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.708
Gives me a direct line
to the NYPD.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.342
And tell me
while you're otherwise engaged,

11:24.380 --> 11:25.972
with whom would_
you suggest I communicate?

11:26.010 --> 11:29.343
Lieutenant Al Burns,
he's with Major Crimes.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.280
Thank you.
Now, sit back, relax,

11:31.320 --> 11:32.810
and I'll be with you again soon.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.885
He better be good.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.922
Yeah, he's good.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.394
Al, you got a call coming in

11:40.430 --> 11:42.421
on line two.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.893
Al Burns.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.989
MAN: Lieutenant Burns,
my congratulations.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.100
You've been chosen by the mayor
to be my liaison.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.402
Must be my luclq day.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.203
Forgive me
for rushing through this part.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.879
I can see everything
outside the building,

11:56.910 --> 11:58.104
thanks to her own cameras,

11:58.150 --> 11:59.401
and the NYPD's vast
surveillance network.

11:59.450 --> 12:02.146
Come within 50 yards
of Skinner Plaza,

12:02.180 --> 12:03.442
and the elevator drops.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.219
Try to breach the building,
the elevator drops.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.444
IfI see a helicopter,

12:06.490 --> 12:08.378
sniper, anything untoward...

12:08.420 --> 12:09.785
The elevator drops.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.956
Very good.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.458
Failure to follow my orders,
and all the hostages die.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.197
You have 47 minutes to get me
my $100 million, Burns.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.299
Hail Eris.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.458
JAY:
Hey, Al,

12:21.500 --> 12:22.865
REPORTER: At this time,
take a look.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.332
we have very little,
but it appears

12:24.370 --> 12:26.770
the entire building
is being held hostage.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.108
We have, uh, ESU here on site.
Now he's got the
whole world's attention.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.209
I hear word of ten

12:30.250 --> 12:32.309
to 12 hostages.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.387
Yeah.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.489
MAN:
Number four,

12:41.520 --> 12:42.828
what's the status
of the elevator?

12:42.860 --> 12:44.225
Yeah, everything's all set here.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.352
Get everything set
for the others.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.051
I'll let you know
when it's time.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.829
Okay, I'm coming up.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.245
What the hell are
you doing in here?

13:13.220 --> 13:14.949
Oh!

13:17.430 --> 13:18.988
No, no, no,

13:19.030 --> 13:21.453
no, no, no, no, no.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.263
Oh, wait.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.268
Here,

13:27.300 --> 13:28.392
tie him up.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.972
This won't work.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.477
All right, thanks.
Okay.

13:37.510 --> 13:40.343
ESU estimates there are ten
people in the penthouse.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.517
I don't get it; he's got

13:41.550 --> 13:42.847
the mayor of New York
in the elevator.

13:42.890 --> 13:43.914
Why does he need
all the hostages?

13:43.950 --> 13:45.281
Collateral, in
case we upset him.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.344
You find anything?

13:46.390 --> 13:47.584
Talked to the contractor.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.929
He said Skinner's
paranoia led him to build

13:49.960 --> 13:51.928
the most secure residential
building in New York.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.497
You can't see inside the windows
from outside, and get this,

13:54.530 --> 13:56.589
they're protected
against thermal body imagery,

13:56.630 --> 13:58.564
which means even snipers can't
even see inside the damn thing.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.363
I bet he's rethinking
that decision.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.038
And apparently he's
such a safety nut,

14:02.070 --> 14:04.630
he's got cameras looking at
every inch outside the building.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.332
It's a virtual fortress, but
there's got to be a way in.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.507
Keep an'eye out.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.348
Come on, come on, Al,
come on, come on.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.517
Now who?

14:16.550 --> 14:17.949
Yeah?

14:17.990 --> 14:18.945
Al.

14:18.990 --> 14:19.911
Carrie.
Yes!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.257
Thank God. You all right?

14:21.290 --> 14:22.985
Listen to me,
I don't have much time.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.624
There's gunmen; they may have
taken over the building.

14:25.660 --> 14:26.479
I'm on the roof with Jo.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.622
They haven't found us yet,

14:27.660 --> 14:28.957
but they had ten hostages
that I've seen,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.126
and they've already shot one.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.525
Eliot, Skinner and the Mayor
are trapped in an elevator.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.595
The man claiming responsibility

14:34.640 --> 14:36.198
says he's going to
drop the elevator,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.208
if he isn't paid $100 million
within the hour.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.572
VVhat

14:40.610 --> 14:42.077
We don't know,

14:42.110 --> 14:43.577
but he's seeing everything
going on outside.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.578
Don't, please, don't be a hero.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.146
You're outmanned, and outgunned.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.239
Stay hidden till we find a way
into the building.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.417
No, listen to me, Al.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.008
If-if you try
to breach the building,

14:52.050 --> 14:54.382
you'll get all of us killed,
I guarantee it.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.157
We're running low
on time and options.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.384
You have one option.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.227
You have me.

15:00.260 --> 15:03.024
You think you saw the guy
in charge?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.061
Maybe, maybe, I-I don't know.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.398
Think, just, just think.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.240
Two of the gunmen,
they were at the party.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.975
They were talking to a guy,
Caucasian,

15:19.010 --> 15:20.011
early 40's,

15:20.050 --> 15:21.449
maybe six foot, bald,

15:21.480 --> 15:23.038
he was wearing
blue tinted glasses.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.615
I'll see if we can get a hit
off of that; you lay low.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.686
Al, I got ten hostages,
four terrorists,

15:27.720 --> 15:29.278
and three people trapped
in an elevator.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.958
I got to get them out.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.355
I can't lay low.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.392
They'll drop the elevator
before you get near them.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.522
Wait, wait, wait.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.699
What happens
if we cut the power?

15:37.730 --> 15:40.699
Right, maybe we activate
the elevator's emergency brake.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.264
All right. I'll get on that.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.403
Listen to me,

15:43.440 --> 15:44.509
these guys
aren't messing around.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.599
Do what you have to,
but I need you

15:46.640 --> 15:48.631
to walk out of that building

15:48.680 --> 15:50.045
for me.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.605
Wish me luck.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.709
All right.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.288
I'm running the description
Carrie passed on.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.526
Any luck narrowing down
suspects on your end?

16:03.560 --> 16:06.188
The voice signed off
with, "Hail Eris",

16:06.230 --> 16:07.549
customary Discordian
salute to Eris,

16:07.600 --> 16:08.498
the Greek goddess of chaos,

16:08.530 --> 16:11.090
used by anarchists
and computer hackers.

16:11.130 --> 16:12.666
"Anarchist and hackers", great.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.066
It could be any one
of the online groups,

16:15.100 --> 16:18.365
uh, or a disgruntled military
or NSA type.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.729
And don't forget Hans Gruber.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.135
I don't know Gruber.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.307
Really
What?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.669
No, really,
you never saw Die Hard?

16:24.710 --> 16:26.348
What?
AL:
What do you got?

16:26.380 --> 16:28.439
Uh, we're thinking
it's some kind of super-hacker.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.084
We should have
an ID for you soon.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.314
If you're looking
for a hacker,

16:31.350 --> 16:32.715
I got someone
who might be able to help.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.751
Hey, all hands on deck.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.711
In the meantime,

16:34.760 --> 16:36.580
we're going to kill
the building's power.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.780
ESU's going in already.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.149
They're not moving.

16:39.190 --> 16:40.623
We're just trying
to improve our hand.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.696
All right, kill it.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.528
We're going to blind this guy.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.645
Oh, no you don't.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.547
Uh, power's still up.

17:06.550 --> 17:07.619
Someone's overriding us.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.718
Try it again.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.749
Al Burns.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.222
_ MAN:
Cutting the power?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.794
Yawn.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.730
Is your strategy
to bore me to death?

17:20.770 --> 17:22.761
_ Just wanted to see _
if you were paying attention.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.509
You got my attention
for the next 34 minutes.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.488
Disobey me again,

17:45.530 --> 17:48.124
and I kill hostages.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.162
Now give me my money.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.667
All right.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.131
That pastry chef is going

17:57.170 --> 17:59.138
to bleed out soon;
I have got to help him.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.434
No, it is too dangerous.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.674
You will get yourself killed.

18:02.710 --> 18:03.779
You stay with me.

18:03.810 --> 18:05.448
I can do more good
as a hostage,

18:05.480 --> 18:06.708
since you work better alone.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.615
All right,

18:08.650 --> 18:10.242
but you do not antagonize the
bad guys.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.382
Jo, I'm serious.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.183
"Antagonize"

18:13.220 --> 18:14.448
Uh, yeah, you.

18:14.490 --> 18:16.583
Look, all I want is for you

18:16.620 --> 18:18.451
to get us out of here
and be safe.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.128
Oh.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.697
You sparkle above us,
I'll sparkle below.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.721
Be careful.

18:28.170 --> 18:29.569
Hi everybody,
did you hear fireworks?

18:31.170 --> 18:32.831
Oh boy.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.100
Kind of you to join us.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.747
This is Tanya Sitkowslq.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.348
Joint Task Force
for Cyber Crimes.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.779
Spent some time on the dark side
of the hacker world.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.219
The dark side, uh...

18:49.260 --> 18:50.249
I'm not sure I see it.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.326
I dabbled, but it didn't take.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.918
Okay, in your dabbling,

18:53.960 --> 18:55.427
you ever, uh,
come across this guy?

18:57.270 --> 19:00.194
Sure, yeah, that's Alpha Omega.

19:00.240 --> 19:00.990
Positive?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.632
Cause I got him
as Jonathan Brody,

19:02.670 --> 19:03.739
former financial analyst.

19:03.770 --> 19:04.668
Did nine months

19:04.710 --> 19:06.530
on an embezzlement charge
four years ago.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.231
You're not wrong.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.474
Do you mind?

19:09.510 --> 19:10.807
Uh, no.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.239
He was a suit, but only ever
really on the outside.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.771
He studied robotics
and game theory at MIT

19:15.820 --> 19:17.219
before Wall Street
snatched him up.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.184
After he got of jail,
he went back to his roots,

19:19.220 --> 19:20.357
but with a decidedly
anarchic bent.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.223
Fancies himself as some sort

19:23.260 --> 19:24.887
of visionary super-hacker.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.329
So what's Omega's vision?

19:26.360 --> 19:27.554
All right, here we go.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.364
This guy has declared war,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.618
on "the hideous hydra-headed
dragon of money

19:32.670 --> 19:34.968
that holds the world its jaws."

19:35.000 --> 19:36.228
"Hideous hydra-headed." Nice.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.567
What's a dorlq mission statement

19:37.610 --> 19:38.759
without _some_
good alliteration, right?

19:38.810 --> 19:40.835
I agree.
It's like General Zod,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.371
who swore to be freed forever...

19:43.410 --> 19:44.843
From the Phantom Zone.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.372
Wow, uh, you read DC?

19:48.420 --> 19:50.786
Is there anything else?

19:52.420 --> 19:55.218
Is this gonna be some separated
at birth thing, or...

19:55.260 --> 19:56.284
All right.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.389
So we know Omega

19:57.430 --> 19:58.829
tried planting a logic bomb

19:58.860 --> 20:01.328
in the World Bank's
collection archives last year,

20:01.360 --> 20:04.295
and their security systems,
barely held.

20:04.330 --> 20:05.661
What was he trying
to accomplish?

20:05.700 --> 20:08.237
Chaos?
That's generally his objective.

20:08.270 --> 20:09.589
Hail Eris.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.937
Exactly.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.608
And, hacking banks is one thing,

20:12.640 --> 20:14.232
but taking hostages

20:14.280 --> 20:15.907
and threatening to kill
innocent people for ransom?

20:15.940 --> 20:17.271
Doesn't fit the profile.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.301
He try to do something
like this before?

20:19.350 --> 20:20.271
Not on this scale,

20:20.320 --> 20:21.309
but he's definitely
been ramping up to it.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.443
Intelligence suggests
he was involved in the crash

20:23.490 --> 20:25.287
of a State Department C-130

20:25.320 --> 20:27.982
taking medical supplies
into Islamabad four months ago.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.284
Yeah, I remember that;
the pilot reported having

20:30.330 --> 20:31.627
massive computer systems
failure right before.

20:31.660 --> 20:32.922
MURRAY: Medical supplies?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.029
I don't get it.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.290
Alpha Omega sees all foreign aid
as America's attempt

20:36.330 --> 20:38.525
to extort cooperation
from other countries.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.438
He was making a point.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.679
Okay, Jo is posing as a hostage
to help the wounded guy.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.348
AL: Jay found out
who we're dealing with.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.779
Former banker
named Jonathan Brody.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.346
He's a nut, and his stunts

20:53.380 --> 20:54.415
have gotten more
and more violent.

20:54.450 --> 20:55.769
If he's threatening hostages,

20:55.820 --> 20:57.048
I'd take him seriously.

20:57.080 --> 20:57.978
All right.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.885
Well, it's time
to get everybody out then.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.353
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.482
You got a plan?

21:02.520 --> 21:03.782
Oh, you know, my usual.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.751
I'll improvise.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.883
I was afraid you were
gonna say that, too.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.023
Listen to me, I need you...

21:09.060 --> 21:12.063
I need you to be okay.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.295
Yeah.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.340
Let me call you back.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.302
All right.

21:26.350 --> 21:27.476
All right.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.947
Bone's been damaged,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.446
but the artery's intact.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.408
Give me your scarf.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.451
This cost $900.

21:37.490 --> 21:38.650
Really?

21:43.130 --> 21:45.826
It's okay, it's okay.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.929
I'm gonna need
a finger here please?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.676
Can I have a finger please?

21:58.910 --> 22:02.846
Do something nice for
a human being for once?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.882
I promise you can kill him
later, if you want.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.012
I didn't mean that.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.399
Thank you.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.437
Okay, it's okay.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.404
Because?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.806
Because I'm good for it,
that's why.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.877
And you tell him that I will
come to Brunei personally,

22:30.910 --> 22:33.708
and kick his butt
if he doesn't get back to me.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.116
There some kind of problem,
Ronald?

22:36.150 --> 22:38.141
ELIOT:
I have a problem...

22:38.190 --> 22:41.751
How can the most technologically
advanced building in the world

22:41.790 --> 22:43.781
still have Muzak
in its elevators?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.525
My portfolio is complicated.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.448
It's not like you
crack open the piggy bank

22:47.500 --> 22:48.797
and take out
$100 million.

22:48.830 --> 22:49.797
Really?

22:49.830 --> 22:52.492
I thought it was just like that.

22:52.530 --> 22:53.963
Guy, this really,
really doesn't help.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.433
Nine phone calls,

22:55.470 --> 22:56.869
and he still doesn't
have the money.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.106
You want to write
the check?

22:58.140 --> 23:00.108
Go ahead,
write the lunatic a check.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.437
You get us
out of here!

23:01.480 --> 23:02.469
Okay, that's it!

23:02.510 --> 23:03.602
Right now, Mr. Mayor,

23:03.650 --> 23:05.402
you get in
that corner,

23:05.450 --> 23:07.475
and you think about nice things
to say about my people

23:07.520 --> 23:08.771
when they come save you.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.788
And you, you get
in that corner

23:10.820 --> 23:12.412
and you get the damn money,

23:12.450 --> 23:13.712
so we don't all die!
You can't talk
to me like that!

23:13.760 --> 23:15.159
How dare
you talk...
Shut up!

23:17.490 --> 23:19.026
Good.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.519
ABE:
Sounds like a fire alarm.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.561
Go check it out.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.561
*

23:57.670 --> 23:59.626
That worked.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.202
I don't want to be a pest,

24:07.240 --> 24:08.502
but could we have
a bathroom break?

24:08.540 --> 24:09.529
Shut up!

24:09.580 --> 24:10.774
MAN:
Yeah.
WOMAN:
I could go...

24:10.810 --> 24:12.744
Do you ever hear
those commercials...

24:12.780 --> 24:15.669
...about people with
a "going problem"?

24:15.720 --> 24:16.675
That's about me.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.652
CARRIE:
Drop it!

24:24.630 --> 24:26.518
Give me your weapon
and stay quiet.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.857
Now, give me
your weapon.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.629
Everyone stay quiet.
Jo, take his gun.

24:31.670 --> 24:33.160
Now you're the one
with a going problem,

24:33.200 --> 24:34.895
'cause they're all
going out of here.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.498
I want you to get 'em
outta here, Jo, now.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.098
Quiet. Everybody up.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.539
For your information,

24:39.570 --> 24:41.174
I have never lost control
of anything.

24:41.210 --> 24:42.677
Shoot him if he tries anything.
How 'bout you,
you okay?

24:42.710 --> 24:44.007
I'm fine, I'll cover you.
Okay.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.041
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90-
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

24:46.080 --> 24:48.548
*

25:32.990 --> 25:34.753
Someone's on the deck.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.789
Get out there.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.058
Go, go, go.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.661
*

26:02.060 --> 26:03.357
ALPHA:
So you're the pretty lady

26:03.390 --> 26:04.721
who's caused
all these problems.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.030
We're gonna have
to breach the buildings

26:14.070 --> 26:15.139
if Skinner doesn't
come up with the money.

26:15.170 --> 26:16.296
With all those cameras,
Omega will know we're coming.

26:16.340 --> 26:17.637
We had to override them.

26:17.670 --> 26:18.364
We tried cutting the power

26:18.410 --> 26:20.332
to the building,
Omega was ready.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.803
Okay.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.705
Well, let's say we kill
the downtown power grid.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.149
Like downtown Manhattan?

26:25.180 --> 26:26.772
Wouldn't have any power
to draw from.

26:26.810 --> 26:28.641
Well, I mean, you're gonna
tick off a lot of people,

26:28.680 --> 26:29.647
but, yeah, that would
probably work.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.681
It's probably
our only choice.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.312
Whoa, whoa, hold on guys.

26:32.350 --> 26:34.352
We turn the power grid off,

26:34.390 --> 26:36.608
that's exactly what
Hans Gruber wanted.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.753
We kill the grid,
he unlocks the vaults,

26:38.790 --> 26:40.018
he gets the bearer bonds.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.152
Die Hard's
a mOV|e, Jay.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.895
And Hans Gruber died
at the end of it.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.761
I doubt he's
involved here.

26:48.670 --> 26:49.739
AL:
Yeah.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.135
ALPHA:
You're almost out of time.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.899
Skinner's close
to havmg your money.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.373
Good, then you won't mind me

26:54.410 --> 26:55.672
moving the deadline up.

26:55.710 --> 26:56.870
You got 15 minutes.

26:56.910 --> 26:58.275
A little more time,
and you'll be paid.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.277
Be reasonable.

26:59.310 --> 27:00.402
I've been more than reasonable.

27:00.450 --> 27:01.815
So, now,

27:01.850 --> 27:04.216
I'm going to send you
a little something

27:04.250 --> 27:05.740
to prove my resolve.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.781
Or should I say someone?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.648
We have no choice.
We have to kill the grid.

27:12.690 --> 27:14.248
I'm heading
over there.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.354
I'm on it.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.389
CARRIE:
All right.

27:20.370 --> 27:21.268
All right!

27:24.140 --> 27:25.107
What are you doing?

27:25.140 --> 27:26.300
I noticed you
at the party.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.934
I'm so pleased
you stuck around.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.768
Yeah, well, I never like to
leave a party before last call.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.448
Oh...

27:34.480 --> 27:36.414
Bet you wish you could
say the same about
your hostages.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.416
Party poopers.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.079
Well done.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.094
Oh... but who needs them

27:49.130 --> 27:51.792
when I've got one of
New York's finest?

27:51.830 --> 27:53.161
And from what I gather,

27:53.200 --> 27:55.168
perhaps the finest
of New York's finest.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.259
Carrie Wells?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.359
I'm in the presence
of greatness.

28:00.410 --> 28:03.379
I wish I could say
the same, "Omega."

28:03.410 --> 28:05.002
More like an iota.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.439
You know your Greek.
Mmm...

28:08.280 --> 28:10.043
Well, then,
you also know

28:10.080 --> 28:11.980
that I am the first
and the last.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.715
The beginning...

28:13.760 --> 28:15.057
and the end.

28:15.090 --> 28:17.729
Well, that's one way
of putting it.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.923
Another is, um,
a deranged psycho.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.428
Thes_e demerits
on your file make sense.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.269
Insubordination...
Oh...

28:25.300 --> 28:27.325
conduct unbecoming.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.437
That's a quality we share.

28:31.470 --> 28:34.109
The established order
longs to control us,

28:34.140 --> 28:36.404
but the tyrant powers
we bow to

28:36.440 --> 28:37.941
have outlived
their time,

28:37.980 --> 28:40.141
rather like the Titans of old.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.374
They need to die

28:41.420 --> 28:43.411
so that a new order
can be born.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.884
Is

28:45.920 --> 28:48.286
But only by cutting away
the dead and useless

28:48.320 --> 28:50.117
can there be new life.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.354
A new beginning for this system.

28:51.390 --> 28:52.880
For all of us.

28:52.930 --> 28:55.421
A new beginning...

28:55.460 --> 28:58.167
What do you want,
Omega?

29:00.070 --> 29:01.992
You'll never know.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.428
Sorry, Carrie.

29:05.470 --> 29:08.530
Like Icarus,
you soared high,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.536
oh, so high.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.344
But your hubris,

29:13.380 --> 29:15.814
thinking that you
could defeat me,

29:15.850 --> 29:18.341
has led to your fall.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.517
And what a long,

29:20.550 --> 29:22.984
glorious fall it will be.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.351
Take her.

29:26.530 --> 29:28.452
Let her test her wings.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.867
OFFICER:
Over here...

29:36.840 --> 29:39.832
Deputy Mayor, Skinner's not
coming up with the money,

29:39.870 --> 29:41.576
We need to shut
the grid down, now.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.237
You understand
you are talking about

29:43.280 --> 29:45.339
wreaking havoc
with city services,

29:45.380 --> 29:46.938
transportation,
emergency response.

29:46.980 --> 29:47.912
This doesn't work,

29:47.950 --> 29:49.508
it could really hurt
the mayor in the polls.

29:49.550 --> 29:50.517
This doesn't work,

29:50.550 --> 29:52.017
he's gonna be hurt
a lot worse.

29:52.050 --> 29:53.950
This has to be the Mayor's call.

29:53.990 --> 29:55.355
You talk to the Mayor

29:55.390 --> 29:56.482
and Omega knows
what we're up to.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.384
Killing the grid

29:57.420 --> 29:59.581
gives us our best chance
of saving everyone

29:59.630 --> 30:01.552
in that building.
Our on chance.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.164
Okay.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.519
We can shut it down.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.492
But we've got
to bring it back up

30:08.540 --> 30:09.393
as quickly
as possible.

30:11.570 --> 30:13.435
Webster and the hostages
are all safe.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.904
They even got one of the perps,
but he's not talking.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.408
Carrie?
Jo says she went
after Omega.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.202
Of course she did.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.547
We may need
to kill the grid

30:21.580 --> 30:23.468
before we hear
from Carrie.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.511
We'll hear from her.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.024
Okay, all right!
Get out there.

30:40.430 --> 30:41.590
No!

30:51.480 --> 30:53.072
Hah!

30:58.020 --> 31:00.011
*

31:31.550 --> 31:33.518
You okay?

31:33.550 --> 31:34.983
Yeah. I didn't get Omega.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.351
AL:
That's fine.

31:36.390 --> 31:37.482
We're gonna shut down
the power grid and move in.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.327
CARRIE:
Listen to me.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.351
Even if the emergency
brake works,

31:40.390 --> 31:42.620
Omega and his men can still
get to Eliot and the mayor

31:42.660 --> 31:45.458
before ESU can get up here
and save them.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.388
We're shutting down the grid
in three minutes.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.532
I better get moving, then.

31:50.970 --> 31:51.959
I should be there with you.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.631
You are.

31:59.550 --> 32:01.040
Okay, here we go, guys.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.149
Grid's shutting down.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.686
Power grid's going down!
Be ready!

32:17.700 --> 32:19.691
*

32:45.090 --> 32:46.421
Oh, boy...

32:53.370 --> 32:54.439
Hey, boys.

32:54.470 --> 32:55.767
Carrie.
So, listen.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.233
They've, uh, wired a bomb

32:57.270 --> 32:58.362
to the cable up here.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.434
We got to go.

32:59.470 --> 33:01.006
It's, uh, it's my building.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.439
I-I go first.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.107
Whatever happened
to the developer goes down

33:04.150 --> 33:06.539
with the development?
Yeah.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.343
Let's go, go, go!
Take my hand, come on!

33:08.380 --> 33:09.711
Go! Come on!

33:09.750 --> 33:11.047
Let's go...

33:11.090 --> 33:12.114
There you go.

33:12.150 --> 33:14.084
Very nice work.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.088
All right, Mr. Mayor,
it's your turn.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.212
Okay.

33:17.260 --> 33:19.023
Yup!

33:19.060 --> 33:20.687
All right. We got it.

33:20.730 --> 33:22.550
Come on.
Thanks.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.067
I want you to go right
up that ladder, okay?

33:24.100 --> 33:25.067
Yup.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.260
All right, you got this.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.234
Hi, Eliot.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.600
Just go. Save them.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.709
As if that's gonna happen.

33:37.140 --> 33:37.708
All right.

33:40.350 --> 33:43.171
I've always been lousy
with orders.

33:43.220 --> 33:46.041
Believe me.._. I've never been
more appreCIative of that fact.

33:46.090 --> 33:50.117
Come on, I'll boost you up.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.698
Pull me up.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.557
The explosion was pretty much
confined to the elevator shaft.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.399
That's all we know.
You see Detective Wells?

34:29.430 --> 34:30.624
Like I said,
that's all we know.

34:30.660 --> 34:32.321
I got guys going
floor to floor.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.769
What do you have?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.734
Found him tied up
in the utility closet

34:35.770 --> 34:37.328
off the lobby, says
he's building security.

34:37.370 --> 34:41.101
Nobody gets cleared
till we put this all together.

34:41.140 --> 34:43.506
Just hold him_ for now.
Yes, Sir.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.600
All right, come
with us. Let's go.

34:46.650 --> 34:50.211
On me.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.239
Drop your weaponl
Drop it! I

34:51.290 --> 34:52.689
We're on the same
team here, boss!

34:52.720 --> 34:54.585
My team doesn't wear wingtips!

34:54.620 --> 34:55.848
Take his helmet off.

34:55.890 --> 34:57.414
Do it. Let's go.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.155
I see you met Carrie.
Got him.

34:59.190 --> 35:00.179
Where's Omega?

35:03.400 --> 35:05.721
Omega might try to slip out.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.261
I need you to check
every uni, medic, hostage.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.631
Anybody coming
out of the building.

35:09.670 --> 35:10.637
You got it.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.659
Hey, Al?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.271
Al!

35:19.750 --> 35:21.718
I needed you to walk out of
that building and you did.

35:21.750 --> 35:24.139
Ah, sometimes
I obey your orders.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.543
Sometimes.
Yeah!

35:25.590 --> 35:27.239
You should've taken
me to that wedding.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.814
Uh, yeah, you're telling me.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.179
We got to get Omega, Al.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.221
We don't know where he is.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.251
He might be gone already.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.450
Yeah, Jay?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.195
I found something curious.

35:36.230 --> 35:37.629
Hey.

35:37.660 --> 35:38.888
I mean we did.

35:38.930 --> 35:39.897
Me and Tanya.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.192
We looked into some

35:41.240 --> 35:42.696
of Skinner's finances.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.901
So, get this-- there's
a good reason why Skinner

35:44.940 --> 35:46.009
couldn't come up with the money.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.928
He doesn't have anything
close to a hundred million.

35:47.970 --> 35:49.278
Not even ten million.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.278
Skinner Plaza's way over-budget.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.345
And Skinner's
overleveraged himself.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.802
He's pretty much cash broke.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.818
Dangerous game
he was playing bluffing.

35:55.850 --> 35:57.613
Yeah, but if we can get
into Skinner's finances,

35:57.650 --> 35:59.345
then so can Omega.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.381
Which means he knew Skinner
didn't have any money.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.308
Why hijack a building
and try to extort a fortune

36:03.360 --> 36:04.884
from a man who doesn't have one?
I don't know.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.056
Building's power's coming on.

36:06.090 --> 36:08.820
We may get some alarms as
the security system reboots.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.488
...but only
by cutting away the dead

36:13.530 --> 36:16.363
and useless can
there be new life.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.300
A new beginning for the system.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.568
For all of us.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.202
CARRIE:
What is it you want, Omega?

36:21.240 --> 36:22.309
A new beginning?

36:22.340 --> 36:23.637
You'll never know.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.439
Al, we got to get a look
at Omega's computers.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.311
Come on.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.811
JAY:
Carrie, Al, you only got three
minutes till the grid powers up.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.316
Guys?

36:36.360 --> 36:38.248
What could Brody do
to temporarily shut down

36:38.290 --> 36:40.224
the security systems, en masse,

36:40.260 --> 36:41.329
and then turned them on again

36:41.360 --> 36:42.190
all at once?

36:42.230 --> 36:43.993
Well, when the systems
switched back on

36:44.030 --> 36:46.760
they'd be vulnerable while the
passwords and protocols reboot.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.360
Yeah, but why'd he break
into something he's already in?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.628
If Brody just wanted
the power off,

36:50.670 --> 36:52.535
why not let us kill it
when we tried earlier?

36:52.570 --> 36:55.232
Because Skinner Plaza was
never his goal.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.736
His aim is to get

36:56.780 --> 36:59.271
the city to shut off
the entire downtown power grid.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.402
I mean, look at us, look!

37:00.450 --> 37:02.418
We're surrounded by the world's
biggest banks, right?

37:02.450 --> 37:04.543
I told you, it's Die Hard!

37:04.590 --> 37:06.842
Not quite-- he needs
the power to come back on

37:06.890 --> 37:09.779
so he can put his computer virus
into the system.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.027
He's not trying
to steal money.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.392
He's trying to reset
the whole financial system

37:14.430 --> 37:15.920
by knocking it out altogether.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.292
Then we have to keep
the power off till we find him.

37:18.330 --> 37:19.467
No, that's impossible.
It's not like a light bulb.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.922
The grid's got too much power.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.268
You can't stop it from
turning on once it's started.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.301
CARRIE:
All right, what would

37:24.340 --> 37:25.466
Brody need to do
to get his virus

37:25.510 --> 37:26.534
into the system?

37:26.570 --> 37:27.559
JAY:
It's just software.

37:27.610 --> 37:29.737
All he needs is a laptop
and a cell signal, right?

37:29.780 --> 37:30.906
He could be anywhere.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.977
There must be
some clue somewhere.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.547
He's still got to be
in the building.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.310
Right?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.613
Please, show me your gift.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.718
CARRIE:
You miss cheating.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.727
Fiery.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.284
I like that.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.894
Those candy wrappers are
from Skinner's bedroom.

37:51.930 --> 37:53.921
Now, what was Brody doing
in Skinner's bedroom?

38:02.010 --> 38:03.932
He was here.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.971
But doing what?
I...

38:13.090 --> 38:14.751
I'm gonna show you something.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.657
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

38:17.690 --> 38:19.351
Al?

38:19.390 --> 38:20.220
Skinner was gonna

38:20.260 --> 38:21.796
show me something
before Jo came in

38:21.830 --> 38:23.354
and interrupted us.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.367
JO:
$80 million for an apartment,

38:27.400 --> 38:28.332
and I can't seem
to find a bathroom.

38:28.370 --> 38:31.999
Skinner is obsessed
With personal security.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.429
He-he kept bragged
about how many millions

38:34.480 --> 38:35.799
he'd spent...

38:35.840 --> 38:37.831
to make this place safe.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.347
And?

38:39.380 --> 38:41.371
And somebody messed
with that book.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.911
It was right side up before.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.923
Take this.

39:08.410 --> 39:10.628
Hands! Show me your hands!

39:11.910 --> 39:13.946
A simple press of a button
and I change the world.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.538
A simple click of the trigger

39:15.580 --> 39:16.808
and your day gets even worse.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.609
The ancients believed that fame

39:19.650 --> 39:21.618
is immortality.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.389
And I'm about to become very,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.126
very famous.

39:25.160 --> 39:28.027
You like your Greek myths,
don't you?

39:28.060 --> 39:30.392
You know the story
about the Gordian knot?

39:30.430 --> 39:32.022
Of course.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.662
A knot so intricate
no one could untie it.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.168
Until Alexander the Great came
and cut it in half

39:36.200 --> 39:37.667
with a single stroke.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.735
Sometimes the simplest solutions
are the best.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.370
OFFICER 1:
All right,
hold him right there.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.409
OFFICER 2:
I got him, heading out.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.645
Let's go.
Okay.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.409
Come on, move it.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.519
Hmm.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.549
Hmm.

39:58.590 --> 40:00.581
Yeah.

40:03.930 --> 40:06.819
So we know what Omega
was doing in here.

40:06.870 --> 40:09.430
What exactly were you
doing in here?

40:09.470 --> 40:11.563
_ Skinner was
givmg me a tour.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.669
Oh, you had
to kick off your heels?

40:13.710 --> 40:15.439
Well...

40:15.480 --> 40:16.879
it was in the line of duty.

40:16.910 --> 40:18.207
Oh, is that what you call it?

40:18.240 --> 40:19.343
Yeah, I had to save the world.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.177
Have you seen how high
these things are?
All right.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.019
Yes, you did.
I did.

40:23.050 --> 40:24.745
Saved your life, too.

40:27.490 --> 40:30.880
Mr. Mayor, these are
the prized members of my team.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.023
This is Carrie Wells.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.496
I owe you a debt
of gratitude, Carrie.

40:35.530 --> 40:38.465
It was an honor, Your Honor,
but the real gratitude

40:38.500 --> 40:40.127
belongs to this guy right here.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.468
Lieutenant Al Burns.
Gutsy move,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.560
Lieutenant, I mean,
killing the power like that.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.565
Thank you.
But...

40:46.610 --> 40:48.635
weren't you concerned
about the consequences

40:48.680 --> 40:50.602
of taking out the grid?

40:50.640 --> 40:52.801
Well, your deputy mayor
explained

40:52.850 --> 40:54.670
_ her various
political concerns

40:54.720 --> 40:57.848
I'm talking
about the bearer bonds.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.484
Like the movie, you know?

40:59.520 --> 41:01.249
Ah, of course, I was.

41:01.290 --> 41:03.155
But saving you was
worth that risk.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.121
Let's get out
of here, Mr. Mayor.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.128
Thank you.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.856
Bye.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.822
"Saving you was
worth that risk."

41:12.870 --> 41:13.825
Had to say something.

41:13.870 --> 41:16.532
You really do have a,
have a future in politics.

41:16.570 --> 41:17.594
Thanks for looking out for me.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.608
I'll always look
out for you.
Really?

41:19.640 --> 41:21.528
Now, how about that dance?

41:21.580 --> 41:22.899
I don't dance.
Oh, you do.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.237
No, I don't dance!

41:24.280 --> 41:26.578
No! Aw, come on.

41:31.050 --> 41:33.541
Oh, your shoe's untied.

41:33.590 --> 41:34.818
Well, it sure is.
Mmm.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.509
Can't wait to get
out of these shoes.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.551
Finally.

41:38.590 --> 41:40.228
Way to go, Burns.

41:40.260 --> 41:42.057
I'm tying my shoe, Jo.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.227
Well, we still have
something to celebrate.

41:44.260 --> 41:45.261
Open it up.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.097
I'm way ahead of you.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.132
To a job well done.

41:49.900 --> 41:50.889
Cheers.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.259
Cheers.

41:53.870 --> 41:54.905
_ ALL:
Yippy-kay-yay.
