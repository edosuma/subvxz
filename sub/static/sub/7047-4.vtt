WEBVTT

00:16.308 --> 00:17.934
Joe? Come on in.

00:25.776 --> 00:29.112
- There's some pitting on number six.
- Okay.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.786
Okay, Paula, look at me a little bit
and open wide.

00:36.912 --> 00:40.748
Listen to you. You sound like an opera star.
Look at that. Perfect.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.625
Look at that. Perfect!

00:42.751 --> 00:45.420
You're in great shape, kiddo.
Here, you can rinse up now.

00:45.504 --> 00:49.340
Here you go.
Hi, Mrs. Pena. What is this?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.719
- Tamales, Doctor.
- They smell awesome.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.303
But I told you,
you don't have to worry about this.

00:54.430 --> 00:57.557
- You just pay whenever you can.
- Until then, tamales.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.225
- Great job, Paula.
- Thank you.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.437
- You're a good man, Dr. Oldham.
- You are too kind.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.313
- Are you an idiot?
- Mr. Ferguson, please lower your voice.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.858
Mrs. Pena, thank you
so much for the tamales.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.861
And, Paula, up and down,
not side to side, okay?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.028
Okay, honey.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.364
- Thanks a lot. I'll see you next time.
- How do you keep your job?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.743
- Hi, Mr. Ferguson.
- Finally, someone with a brain.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.911
- Is there a problem?
- Fire this woman.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.707
She has no idea what she's talking about
and she's wasting my time.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.417
I have clients to get to.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.044
He insists his insurance company
covers these procedures.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.838
I've called repeatedly. They don't.

01:28.964 --> 01:33.468
As I have explained three times now,
my insurance company requires

01:33.552 --> 01:36.637
additional paperwork
for the semi-elective procedures,

01:36.722 --> 01:40.725
i.e., my caps and gold crowns,
which she is clearly too lazy to do!

01:40.851 --> 01:42.852
- I'll look into it.
- Don't look into it. Fix it.

01:42.978 --> 01:47.857
I can't come in here every time
and argue with your sub-mental staff

01:47.983 --> 01:50.985
about out-of-pocket compensation.
I have things to do!

01:51.069 --> 01:52.111
Would you keep your voice down?

01:52.196 --> 01:54.614
You know what?
I have had it with you people.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.325
I could get better dental work
in a Third-world country.

01:57.409 --> 02:02.288
A cleaner office, too. I mean, Jesus!
Get some Pine-Sol!

02:02.372 --> 02:04.582
Leave here needing a tetanus shot.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.893
No, I don't care if he's a paraplegic,
and I don't care if he's a quadriplegic.

02:24.019 --> 02:27.021
Hell, I don't care if he's just a torso
on a skateboard, my man.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.065
- What the hell!
- Don't move. Don't move.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.276
Now, you're gonna do everything I say,
or I'm gonna jab this needle in your neck,

02:32.402 --> 02:35.238
I'm gonna depress the plunger,
I'm gonna shoot you full of drain cleaner,

02:35.364 --> 02:37.406
- and you're gonna die.
- You got to be... Okay, okay, okay.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.742
- All right. Open the door. Open the door.
- Okay.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.078
- Okay. Get in.
- Okay, okay.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.287
- Put the seat back.
- Okay.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.040
- Put it back faster.
- This is as fast as it goes, okay?

02:46.124 --> 02:47.416
All right.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.627
Open your mouth.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.380
Just open your mouth.
Go, "Ah, ah." It's easy.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.091
Good, good, good, good.
Now, you think I'm a real jerk-off, right?

02:55.217 --> 02:56.634
It's rhetorical. Shut up.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.053
You think because I have
a shabby little office that I'm a loser?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.264
I'm a man, Mr. Ferguson. I help people.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.475
I take care of them
in exchange for tamales and hot sauce.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.687
Now, in order to pay for that,
assholes like you get the up-sell,

03:07.771 --> 03:11.315
the bonding, the laser whitening,
the gold, not porcelain, crowns.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.525
Now you say you don't want to pay?

03:12.609 --> 03:13.651
- I...
- You don't want to pay me?

03:13.777 --> 03:15.862
- I didn't...
- You know what? It's all right.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.239
But I'm gonna take back what's mine.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.074
Open your mouth.
I'm gonna stab you in the throat.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.534
I'm gonna stab you in the throat.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.203
You can consider me a repo man, all right?

03:24.288 --> 03:26.747
Open wide. Open wide.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.459
Okay. Halfway done. Good job.
Real wide, real wide, real wide.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.421
Little bit more, little more. Wide, wide!

03:38.927 --> 03:40.136
You can rinse now.

04:23.180 --> 04:28.392
This morning at 8:45 LA time,
LAPD got a 911 call

04:28.518 --> 04:33.272
from a patient of a Dr. Peter Oldham, DDS,
from a Mr. Ferguson

04:33.357 --> 04:38.361
who had two of his back molars
excised without anesthetic in a parking lot.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.700
Rollie Pike. Well, how did they find out?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.744
LAPD ran prints, got a match.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.870
Media?

04:48.038 --> 04:51.624
Yeah. It's all over CNN now.
Security camera footage.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.834
"The crazy dentist." It's got legs.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.963
What's the clock on it?
The cartel has a long memory.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.299
There's a flight,
connects through Chicago to LA,

05:00.384 --> 05:01.467
leaves in 40 minutes.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.344
Rachel's downstairs.
She's gonna go with you.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.181
What?

05:07.265 --> 05:11.018
You afraid she's gonna cramp your style,
cock-block you from banging a starlet?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.728
Yeah, and Rollie's my case.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.815
Yeah, but because of you,
it's now mine, too.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.900
And Rachel's going with you.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.404
And not only that.
You're gonna love this part.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.905
Rachel's taking lead.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.408
Why?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.601
Raylan Givens.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.566
- Jim.
- Hey, Raylan.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.819
- Hello, Jim.
- Look at that hat! How's Winona?

06:01.945 --> 06:05.281
She's still happily married to someone else.
Thanks for asking.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.241
- Rachel Brooks, Jim Ferzinsky.
- Nice to meet you.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.537
Jim and I worked together in Texas.
Rachel's the lead on this one.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.665
Well, thank God.
Now maybe we won't lose him a third time.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.917
- Just the once in Brownsville.
- What about Nicaragua?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.085
He wasn't there.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.421
He tell you
how he lost Pike in Brownsville?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.381
- I read the report.
- She read the report.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.134
No, the report lacks all the flavor,
all the nuance.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.303
You want me to tell her
or you want to do it?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.471
I think we should get to work.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.723
We all knew
Rollie was heading for the border.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.475
So Ray-Ray here went to Brownsville,

06:32.601 --> 06:35.144
and he staked out a bar
where people go to buy paper.

06:35.270 --> 06:39.190
And sure enough, Rollie walked in.
Raylan made his pitch.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.443
He told Rollie he could either spend
a short life on the run

06:42.527 --> 06:46.238
from bad guys like Tommy Bucks,
or he could get him into WitSec

06:46.323 --> 06:47.698
and get him a new identity.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.158
Now, you must have really thought
you had him.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.326
He gave me his word.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.953
Yeah, see, I always take
a fugitive's word over handcuffs.

06:53.705 --> 06:58.000
And then Rollie asked him
if he could finish watching...

06:58.126 --> 07:00.920
What was it?
A kids' Christmas special on TV?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.714
And then what happened next?
This is my favorite part.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.633
I went next door to 31 Flavors.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.678
He went and got himself an ice cream!

07:09.805 --> 07:12.264
And then the next time
you saw his face was what?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.058
On your computer screen this morning?

07:14.184 --> 07:16.602
Excuse me. I'm guessing
you're shutting down the office,

07:16.686 --> 07:19.772
and I was wondering if I could
take these so they don't go bad.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.150
- What are they?
- Tamales. You want one?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.819
No thanks.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.073
Your loss. They're real good.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.743
- Who's she?
- Receptionist. Mindy Springer.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.580
How did he pass himself off as a dentist?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.749
He wasn't passing.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.627
He got himself a degree
from a dental school down in Panama.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.214
Came back here, kept his head down,
worked the fringe, illegals,

07:45.382 --> 07:47.049
people without insurance.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.551
Just doesn't seem like a dentist.

07:50.011 --> 07:54.014
Always thought he'd be on a beach
somewhere in Belize or Brazil.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.519
We may have a problem.
There's gold missing.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.902
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.070
Let me see.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.533
- Mrs. Pena's tamales?
- Underneath.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.744
Smart.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.913
It was exciting.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.373
But there were a lot more guys
than I expected.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.252
Yeah, well, I did extract two teeth
without anesthesia or permission.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.296
But why would they send out 20 guys?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.591
I got a lot of unpaid parking tickets.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.595
So, what do we do now?

08:32.888 --> 08:36.432
We trade the gold for cash.
We get a new car, new IDs.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.933
Once we're across the border,
we cruise on down to Belize,

08:39.059 --> 08:42.688
where they speak English
and it's almost impossible to be extradited.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.649
And then we set up shop,
and we start fixing kids' teeth again.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.568
Sound good?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.695
Sounds crazy, but yeah.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.946
Okay.

08:58.121 --> 09:02.416
I'm sorry if I crossed a line
with you at the office.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.836
If I shouldered my way
to the front of the line, it wasn't intentional.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.297
I can only imagine how hard it's been
for you to get where you are

09:08.423 --> 09:09.506
in the Marshals Service.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.135
Because I'm black
or because I'm a woman?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.638
- Because you're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.681
I didn't shoulder my way
to the front of the line.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.475
I didn't say that. You did.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.977
Well, look, I understand
I'm the low man on the totem pole.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.562
I understand that.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.191
But Rollie and I have a long history,
and I should be walking point.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.779
This isn't just about this case.
You did cut to the front of the line.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.865
And I don't know if it's because
you know the chief from Glynco,

09:34.991 --> 09:37.159
but you walked in,
and you went right to the front.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.829
Yeah. You ever consider
I happen to be good at the job?

09:41.122 --> 09:45.125
And you being a tall, good-looking
white man with a shitload of swagger,

09:45.210 --> 09:49.296
that has nothing to do with it?
You get away with just about anything.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.216
- What do I get away with?
- Look in the mirror.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.512
How do you think it'd go over
if I came into work one day

09:56.638 --> 09:58.639
wearing a cowboy hat?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.185
You think I'd get away with that?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.149
You want to try it on?

10:20.704 --> 10:25.582
Two stores down, they trade cash for gold.
Get big bills.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.626
You don't want 15 pounds of money.

10:27.711 --> 10:30.212
And I'll pick you up out front
in about half an hour.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.880
Why don't you do it?

10:33.216 --> 10:37.594
Because they have security cameras,
and I don't want any more security cameras.

10:37.721 --> 10:38.887
You need anything out of the car?

10:39.055 --> 10:40.764
One of those tamales. I haven't had lunch.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.809
Forget about the tamales.
When I get back, I'll take you to In-N-Out.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.185
Where are you going?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.855
I'm gonna get us a new car
because they'll have yours by now.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.190
- You have enough to buy one?
- I'll figure something out.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.109
What, are you gonna steal one?

10:53.236 --> 10:54.778
You know how to steal a car?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.947
- Just get the money, okay?
- What's going on?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.073
What do you mean?

10:59.909 --> 11:03.287
I am not the smartest person in the world,
but I'm not an idiot.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.416
I know you don't get federal agents after you
because of unpaid parking tickets.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.086
Tell me the truth, or I walk.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.768
Up until six years ago,
I worked for some really bad men.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.603
How bad?

11:27.729 --> 11:30.314
Scarface-cut-your-arm-off-
with-a-chainsaw kind of bad.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.275
- Jesus.
- I was their accountant.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.278
I just moved money around.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.656
And then one day, I couldn't do it anymore.

11:39.783 --> 11:43.494
So I took some of their money. And I ran.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.622
And that's why I had to change my name.

11:47.499 --> 11:48.957
Why didn't you tell me?

11:49.292 --> 11:52.086
Well, how do you think that conversation
would have gone?

11:52.170 --> 11:56.673
"Mindy, yeah, before I was a dentist,
I was a money launderer for a drug cartel."

12:00.470 --> 12:01.804
What else did you lie about?

12:02.597 --> 12:05.182
Well, I don't really know how to steal a car.

12:08.311 --> 12:12.648
Look, if you want to walk, I understand.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.985
How long until we're in Belize?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.988
Thirty-six hours. Maybe less.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.876
What's your real name?

12:34.504 --> 12:37.506
Roland. Roland Pike.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.051
But everybody called me Rollie.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.682
Okay, Rollie. Don't lie any more, okay?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.018
You'd break my heart.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.549
You gonna steal that car?
In broad daylight?

13:20.675 --> 13:24.720
What! No, this is my car.
I was just gonna go home.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.430
Ain't your car!

13:27.515 --> 13:29.016
No, really, I promise you, it's mine.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.728
Tell me the license-plate number,
without looking!

13:34.856 --> 13:37.608
Can you remember your plate number?
Really? 'Cause I never can.

13:37.734 --> 13:41.278
I saw whose car that was,
and I saw you drive up

13:42.363 --> 13:43.572
in that Le Mans!

13:46.117 --> 13:48.035
Are you undercover security?

13:48.870 --> 13:52.080
I'm just a tired old man
waiting for the movie theater to open.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.923
That's a sweet ride.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.515
- Detroit in its day! Man!
- Enjoy it.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.142
And thank you for your service
to our nation.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.895
I lost the leg to diabetes,
but you're welcome.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.694
You see or hear anything,
just call the number on that card.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.862
Ma'am.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.281
I saw the dentist Mindy works for,
on the news.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.035
- Did you?
- You ever see him here?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.955
Yeah, all the time. Is Mindy okay?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.290
As far as we know.
Is she a friend of yours?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.126
Just to say hi to,
go out for a drink sometimes.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.796
Miss... I'm sorry. What's your name?

14:41.005 --> 14:42.506
Burnett, Shawni.

14:45.260 --> 14:49.555
Miss Burnett, did you ever call Mindy
on your cell phone?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.932
Yeah, sure. Why?

15:00.483 --> 15:05.362
- Is this the best car you could get?
- Come on! It's a Honda!

15:05.488 --> 15:09.324
It's nice! How much did you get?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.034
$4,700.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.287
What?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.249
That was at least $10,000 in gold.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.794
Yeah, but after the conversion fee,
the service charge, the state and city tax,

15:20.878 --> 15:23.213
and the one-time convenience charge,
it came to $4,700.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.923
Mindy, the guy ripped you off.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.300
I did exactly what you told me.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.802
$4,700? Oh, my God!

15:29.053 --> 15:32.556
I'm sorry, Rollie,
but, see, I'm new at being a criminal.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.058
- Don't answer that! Don't answer that!
- It's okay. It's Shawni.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.560
- Turn it off!
- I want her to have my plants!

15:36.686 --> 15:37.978
Well, then, send her a postcard from Belize!

15:38.062 --> 15:40.063
- Stop yelling at me!
- Mindy, turn the phone off!

15:40.189 --> 15:41.523
- Hello, Shawni.
- Oh, God.

15:42.233 --> 15:46.236
Miss Springer,
this is Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.196
I'd like to speak to Rollie.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.365
It's for you.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.453
Hello?

15:54.537 --> 15:57.873
Rollie. Raylan Givens.
Don't know if you remember me.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.209
Raylan! My favorite US Marshal!

16:01.878 --> 16:04.630
- I saw you this morning.
- Yeah? Where?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.423
Right outside my office building.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.842
Yeah, I never forget a hat.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.470
That's funny,
'cause I saw you this morning, as well.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.681
It was on CNN. You should have said hi.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.184
Well, I was in little bit of a hurry.
You understand.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.394
- But you looked good, man.
- Thank you.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.814
- I suppose you're still really mad at me?
- Rollie.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.777
If anything, I'm mad at myself.
I thought I had you measured.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.528
You gave me your word and I took it.

16:28.613 --> 16:33.116
Well, Raylan, I would really love
to take the time to explain why I ran,

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
but I have enough respect for you
to know that

16:35.870 --> 16:38.705
you're probably putting a trace on this,
so I'm gonna have to bid you adieu.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.708
Rollie, just one more thing. I'll be quick.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.212
If I saw you on TV, in fact,
the whole Marshals Service

16:45.296 --> 16:49.800
and the FBI, you know,
even Shawni saw you on TV,

16:49.926 --> 16:52.761
it's a fair bet your friends in Miami
saw you, as well.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.180
You know what's gonna happen to you
and Miss Springer

16:55.264 --> 16:58.141
if the bad guys find you before I do?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.394
Nobody's finding me, Raylan.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.902
We'll have a location in two minutes.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.570
Roland Pike has dodged
the Marshals Service, the FBI,

17:11.656 --> 17:15.450
and the mob for over five years.
He's already dumped the phone.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.005
Doesn't bother you, working for spics?

17:29.132 --> 17:32.968
See, the spics we got here,
they're mostly wetbacks with no papers.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.344
They pick lettuce all day,

17:34.470 --> 17:36.888
live like 30-deep in some rat-piss
apartment or else, like, you know,

17:36.973 --> 17:39.975
homemade tents out by the highway.
Point is, they ain't running shit.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.978
- No.
- "No" what?

17:43.646 --> 17:44.938
No, it doesn't bother me.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.943
Yeah, well, it would me.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.488
Reason I got kicked out of the Corps, aside
from all that shit with the missing tires,

17:53.614 --> 17:56.032
was because I didn't even like
taking orders from a white man.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.201
But a honey dripper? Forget it.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.787
Can't tell those people a goddamn thing.

18:01.330 --> 18:05.667
Hey, it's me. Yeah, is he there?
Yeah, put him on for me.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.587
Are you gonna tell me
who you're talking to,

18:08.671 --> 18:10.422
or is it just, like, hush-hush, need-to-know?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.840
I'm calling Miami.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.800
What, you gonna tell them
all that spicaroo stuff I said?

18:13.885 --> 18:16.178
- I was just kidding with that.
- You see that guy in the hat?

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
The tall one?

18:21.142 --> 18:22.559
The one in the hat.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.857
Hey, yeah, yeah, it's me.
No, no, no, everything's fine.

18:28.983 --> 18:32.110
Just, remember that cowboy Marshal
who did Tommy Bucks?

18:32.195 --> 18:36.031
He's here. I don't know.
Must be looking for Rollie, too.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.451
That's exactly what I was thinking.

18:39.535 --> 18:44.414
Okay, good, you want to clear it with Gio?
Call me back at this number. Good.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.680
Sir, I'm gonna need you to keep

19:00.765 --> 19:03.391
both your hands
on top of the steering wheel for me, please.

19:03.518 --> 19:06.686
I'm gonna need you to kiss my taint,
you ofay piece of shit!

19:06.771 --> 19:08.522
Sir, you don't have to use
that kind of language.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.566
Listen to you.
Talking like a real house Negro.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.777
Sir, we stopped you because
this vehicle has been flagged

19:13.903 --> 19:15.862
in a federal hot-pursuit manhunt.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.073
But right now we're gonna ask you
to please step out of the car

19:18.199 --> 19:20.951
before we have
to take you out of the car, sir.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.329
You ought to show some respect
for your elders.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.500
I was greasing slopes in the Mekong delta

19:28.584 --> 19:33.255
while you and your boyfriend
were still sucking on your mamas' titties.

19:33.381 --> 19:37.259
- Sir, I don't know what the Mekong delta is.
- Sir, this vehicle is not registered to you.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.468
I just got it.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.387
- Where did you get it?
- Found it.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.806
- You found it? And where did you find it?
- Found it.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.268
In your sister's ass.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.440
This one's cheap.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.610
Okay, this guy's the real deal.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.616
- Buenos días, Hector.
- Do I know you?

20:02.410 --> 20:05.120
Five years ago, I bought a complete set.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.999
Yeah. What can I get you?

20:09.250 --> 20:12.085
Everything. I need a DL,
I need a sosh, I need a passport. Her, too.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.255
They got to be perfect.
I need them ASAP. I got $1,000 cash.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.465
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. $1,200 for the rush.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.509
No, no, I mean I'm out. I'm retired.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.760
Wait, you retired?

20:21.137 --> 20:25.432
The game is different since 9/11.
Homeland Security, holograms, all that shit.

20:25.516 --> 20:29.394
- It ain't like it was back in the day.
- Jesus.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.688
Coyote. It's the only shot you got.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.481
They usually only bring people north,

20:33.608 --> 20:35.609
but pay enough,
they'll get you into North Korea.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.068
Where the hell am I gonna find a coyote?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.863
Wish I could help you,
but I'm just a broken-down, old scratcher.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.615
Can I order something?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.074
- Sure.
- Sorry, we never went to In-N-Out...

20:43.159 --> 20:44.242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.619
I'll have the ceviche.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.287
Great choice. You're gonna love it.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.540
I'll just continue to follow your lead.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.127
No, by all means,
you take the angry black man.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.049
Mr. Jones, Officer Peters tells me
you found this car?

20:59.175 --> 21:02.260
None of his business. Yours, either.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.680
What are you, some kind of fancy lawman?
Federal Bureau of Intimidation?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.974
- US Marshal.
- Yeah?

21:08.059 --> 21:09.184
Yeah. See?

21:09.310 --> 21:14.105
Yeah? I mean, did the Gold Dust Twins
tell you I was some kind of radical militant

21:14.190 --> 21:16.399
and I have a soft spot for the Marshals

21:16.525 --> 21:18.652
because they walked
James Meredith into school?

21:19.737 --> 21:21.655
Well, I hadn't joined up yet at that point,

21:21.739 --> 21:24.574
but if you want to give me credit for it,
I won't stop you.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.618
Am I supposed to be impressed
you got a colored partner?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.370
All this post-racist shit.

21:28.496 --> 21:32.290
Mr. Jones, we think you swapped cars
with a little funny guy,

21:32.375 --> 21:35.377
looked like he was running from something.
That sound 'bout right?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.213
Am I hearing you dropping your R's?

21:38.339 --> 21:40.882
Are you trying to get down with me,
soul sister?

21:41.008 --> 21:45.053
Sir, why don't you save everyone some time
and tell us what he's driving now?

21:45.179 --> 21:47.222
Otherwise we have to run through
the DMV database

21:47.306 --> 21:49.140
just to get your make, model, and license.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.810
I mean, we'll find it, but...
I hear, in this state,

21:51.894 --> 21:55.814
it sometimes takes the DMV half an hour
just to answer the phone.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.567
Well... You best get started.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.195
I'm looking at him right now.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.409
Beautiful. Yeah, I get it.
Tell Gio not to worry.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.915
- We're good.
- The cowboy goes?

22:14.041 --> 22:18.169
We stay on him until he brings us to Rollie,
then we clip them both.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.841
He mention me?

22:38.441 --> 22:42.193
Hey, Mrs. Pena. It's me, Dr. Oldham.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.695
That's not your real name.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.283
Look, can we come in?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.123
Paula saw on the news
how you hurt that man.

22:55.249 --> 22:56.374
No. No, Mrs. Pena.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.918
That video was taken
completely out of context.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.254
What do you want from us?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.215
Mindy and I need to get into Mexico.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.887
The police are everywhere.
My picture's all over the news.

23:08.971 --> 23:12.807
And they're watching the borders
very closely. We need help.

23:12.933 --> 23:16.561
We need someone who knows
how to get across without being caught.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.398
- A coyote?
- Yeah.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.444
So you come to us
because we are Mexican?

23:26.322 --> 23:29.824
I come to you because you've been a patient
and hopefully a friend for many years.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.076
And we are Mexican.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.120
- Mrs. Pena, Mindy and I are in danger.
- Please.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.831
I can't help you.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.296
This is my house and my decision.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.520
Doctor, you've been good to this family,
to my granddaughter.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.855
I will try to help you.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.652
Can I use your bathroom?

24:06.445 --> 24:07.862
911. What is your emergency?

24:09.323 --> 24:11.032
Can I just... Thanks.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.619
911. What is your emergency?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.704
There's a fugitive in my home.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.212
Okay, do you know where they were going?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.381
I sent them to the Home Depot.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.299
- How many of them were there?
- Two.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.051
Two. Did they threaten you in any way?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.511
No.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.645
- What?
- My tummy.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.064
- You got to go again?
- I think so.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.900
- Okay, make a fist.
- Make a fist?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.653
- We've got to keep to the schedule.
- It's not like I'm choosing this!

24:48.737 --> 24:51.156
- We're making really good time.
- Do you want me to go in the car?

24:51.240 --> 24:54.033
Okay, okay, okay. I'm pulling over.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.077
I just want to know one thing.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.330
Who the hell orders ceviche
off a taco truck?

24:59.415 --> 25:02.667
You know what?
When I woke up, I had a nice job, a nice car,

25:02.751 --> 25:04.836
and a nice boyfriend who was a dentist!

25:04.920 --> 25:06.921
Now I'm on the run
with a former drug kingpin,

25:07.047 --> 25:12.260
and I could really use a kind word
before I poop and puke for the fourth time!

25:12.845 --> 25:13.845
Oh, God.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.264
He'll be at the Home Depot off of the 805.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.478
- All right.
- Thanks.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.775
So, the old man set Pike up with a coyote.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.069
Supposed to meet him
at a Home Depot off the 805.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.950
- Shall we?
- Give me just a sec.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.458
May I sit?

25:49.757 --> 25:54.052
I'm sure you were hoping
to put this disruption behind you.

25:54.136 --> 25:58.014
You know, it's jarring having strangers
asking questions.

25:58.098 --> 26:02.060
But I hope you'll permit me
to ask just a few more.

26:04.188 --> 26:08.024
I understand you have a connection
to Dr. Oldham.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.611
I myself have a connection
of a different sort.

26:11.695 --> 26:16.241
I didn't bake him any food,
like your daughter,

26:16.325 --> 26:20.328
but you could fairly say
I feel a sense of obligation to the man.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.375
You understand this obligation,
which is why

26:26.252 --> 26:29.796
I think you may have misled
the men who just left.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.510
It's okay.

26:35.594 --> 26:39.138
But you should know that
without proper information,

26:39.223 --> 26:42.600
bad men will find your dentist friend
before I can.

26:44.186 --> 26:48.314
They will kill him.
And then they'll kill the girl.

26:50.025 --> 26:54.195
And I will do everything I can
to make sure that doesn't happen.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.954
I'm saying why does he still have
his gun out in the first place?

27:03.038 --> 27:05.248
When was the last time
you rode around in a car holding your gun?

27:05.332 --> 27:06.874
'Cause it's a movie!

27:06.959 --> 27:10.086
If that don't happen, then there's no movie,
no messy car, no cleaner.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.131
I mean, what do they do?
They drive home, jerk off, take a nap?

27:14.425 --> 27:15.925
Gentlemen.

27:19.638 --> 27:24.058
I know you. You're from Miami.
You work for Gio.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.311
But I don't recognize your friend.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.647
I'm guessing he's a local,
some guy they got you paired up with.

27:29.732 --> 27:30.773
What makes you say that?

27:30.858 --> 27:34.193
You don't seem like the kind of guy
that gets flown places to do wet work.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.612
You seem like the kind of guy
this guy's got to put up with

27:36.697 --> 27:38.156
because you happen to know the area.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.825
- The hell's that supposed to mean?
- Where do we go from here, Marshal?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.785
Well, I got a couple options.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.704
One, and it's in that position for a reason,

27:44.788 --> 27:47.248
I get out of the car
and this guy takes you back to the airport,

27:47.333 --> 27:48.499
and when you get back to Miami,

27:48.584 --> 27:51.169
you tell Gio I told him he should
hire one of those consultants

27:51.253 --> 27:54.839
that teach guys how to survive in prison,
because Rollie's testimony

27:54.923 --> 27:57.425
- is gonna put him there all day.
- And that's it?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.762
Second option, next time I see you,
I kill you.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.222
Isn't that the line you used
on Tommy Bucks?

28:03.307 --> 28:05.224
How did that work out for him?

28:06.435 --> 28:08.269
Well, there's two of us, cowboy.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.146
You gonna count on him
to back your play?

28:10.230 --> 28:13.399
'Cause if that happens, you go first.
And that's not an insult.

28:13.484 --> 28:17.028
- You always go for the good ones first.
- Well, that's flattering. Thanks.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.654
Well, there's a third option.

28:18.739 --> 28:22.033
We just get to it right here,
and you die in the car.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.577
Any takers?

28:26.663 --> 28:28.915
Okay, then.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.939
Well, this is it.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.566
We are officially in the middle
of frigging nowhere.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.070
You don't think he's gonna drive us
across in his trunk?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.448
- I would not like that.
- Hey, white people!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.579
Take these.

29:08.664 --> 29:12.500
Blankets, oranges, water.
We'll go halfway and stop.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.795
We'll wait for dark, then we cross at night.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.547
Good.

29:21.927 --> 29:22.969
Okay, honey.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.693
- I found the car.
- Guess the old man trusted you.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.611
How far ahead of you are they?

29:41.655 --> 29:44.657
I don't know. It's still hot.
They can't be more than a few minutes.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.659
What do you need?

29:46.743 --> 29:50.204
Well, you better send a chopper here
as fast you can.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.250
And an ambulance.

30:02.676 --> 30:03.718
Hey, Marshal.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.013
Right there's good.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.808
Frank, you don't have to listen to him.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.772
You know what? I changed my mind.
I'm gonna take you first.

30:17.691 --> 30:18.900
Frank, don't listen to him.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.694
We just want to talk to you, Marshal,
see if we can work something out.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.947
Can't see's we got anything to talk about,
but if you want to say something,

30:25.032 --> 30:26.407
you can say it from right there.

30:28.118 --> 30:31.537
Can I come a little closer so we're not
shouting like a couple of drunken hoboes?

30:31.622 --> 30:32.663
I can hear you.

30:34.249 --> 30:38.127
Well, is it okay if I come a little closer?
Is that okay?

30:38.212 --> 30:41.422
You take one more step, I'll shoot you.
That's all I'm gonna say.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.261
Marshal, I want to tell you
something important.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.066
Use it or throw it away.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.580
God, I have to sit here a sec,
catch my breath.

31:14.665 --> 31:17.708
- Got an ambulance on the way.
- That'll be nice.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.127
I warned you. Twice.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.423
Well, I guess I'm one of those guys
who don't believe you

31:24.508 --> 31:27.927
when you tell them the stove's hot.
I have to touch it.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.429
Might get me in trouble one day.

31:34.184 --> 31:38.187
Man! You sure did
rough me up here, Marshal.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.482
But I think we still might get the decision.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.778
See, on the way here,
we were talking to our guy in Mexico,

31:45.862 --> 31:50.700
so if Rollie's not already dead,
he will be soon.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.413
I think we can call this a draw.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.693
Thank God.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.656
It's like the devil's anvil out here.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.367
Yeah. Pay me.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.038
When you get us across.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.914
You want to walk
the rest of the way on your own?

32:41.543 --> 32:42.627
Rollie, just pay him.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.338
Listen to chica.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.634
Fine. Fine.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.347
New price. $2,500 each.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.224
What? No.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.811
I changed my mind. People run out.
You're running in.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.564
You're on the run. Me? I don't care.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.734
But I turn you in to someone who does,
maybe I get a reward.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.902
That's just good business.

33:07.986 --> 33:12.615
I don't have $5,000.
I've got $2,500. That was the deal.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.243
Second thought.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.578
Don't even think about it.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.748
I really wasn't asking for permission.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.793
I'm telling you, don't touch her.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.506
Okay. First, I give her a sniff.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.925
Hey, hey.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.763
Rollie! Rollie!

33:37.933 --> 33:38.933
Rollie!

33:46.191 --> 33:47.692
Want to play?

33:50.779 --> 33:52.279
Rollie!

33:57.285 --> 33:59.620
No! Shithead!

34:06.795 --> 34:10.464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.138
You've got to go back.
You got to get away from me.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.597
What are you talking about?

34:18.681 --> 34:21.308
Don't you see what I just did?
I just killed that guy.

34:21.393 --> 34:25.020
- Rollie, he was gonna rape me.
- I always knew this would happen.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.147
What?

34:26.481 --> 34:27.815
All those years working for those assholes,

34:27.899 --> 34:31.944
I told myself, "You're not a bad guy.
You're just working for bad people."

34:32.027 --> 34:36.657
But I knew. I knew it.
I knew deep down that I was capable of this.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.824
Rollie.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.034
I yank a guy's teeth out,
and now I kill a guy.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.329
- You got to get away from me.
- Rollie.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.331
You don't even know who I am.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.878
For five years, I watched you

34:49.004 --> 34:52.255
put in kids' fillings and crowns
for tamales and corn.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.385
I know who you are.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.556
Let's go have a new life.

35:34.216 --> 35:38.886
- I'm empty.
- Okay. You can have mine.

35:40.597 --> 35:43.390
- How's your stomach?
- It's fine. I'm gonna go pee.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.067
- You're almost done!
- Okay.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.173
- Thank God.
- Rollie?

36:16.258 --> 36:18.592
He's over there. He's hurt.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.011
Rollie!

36:21.096 --> 36:24.598
- Mindy, who is that? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.938
- Hello, Rollie.
- Hey, Raylan.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.315
This is something, isn't it?

36:34.818 --> 36:37.778
It is one for the books. You all right?

36:37.988 --> 36:39.613
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.699
You armed?

36:42.659 --> 36:44.618
Well, I just had my dick in my hand.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.538
Well, why don't you put that away
and get the hell over here?

36:48.039 --> 36:49.331
Okay.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.301
You know what?
On second thought, stay there.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.802
Who is that? Is that your guys?

37:03.972 --> 37:06.307
No, that's the bad guys.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.852
Looks like we got a sniper
on the Mexican side.

37:10.604 --> 37:14.315
- Well, that's not gonna help tourism!
- Well, you just stay put for a few minutes.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.652
- Few minutes, huh?
- Help is on the way.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.488
They're gonna help me get to Belize?
'Cause that's where we were going.

37:21.615 --> 37:24.199
Mindy in a hammock
and me with an ice-cold beer.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.745
Well, I can get you that beer
as soon as we're done here.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.415
Yeah? Does your
witness-protection offer still stand?

37:31.499 --> 37:32.791
Sure, absolutely.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.836
- Think they'd let me be a dentist?
- I don't know, Rollie.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.423
Come on, Ray! You know!

37:39.507 --> 37:41.425
They never let you do
what you did in your old life.

37:41.509 --> 37:45.012
I'm lucky if they'll let me be
a greeter at Wal-Mart!

37:55.857 --> 37:57.024
Why did you become a dentist?

37:59.986 --> 38:01.320
You're gonna laugh.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.199
Really?
That's your biggest concern right now?

38:07.619 --> 38:09.328
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.038
The song?

38:11.373 --> 38:12.456
TV special.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.961
- Well, I'm sure I've seen it.
- I know you've seen it.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.630
It was what was on the TV
when we were in Brownsville.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.048
See, I knew I'd seen it.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.842
You remember a character named Hermey?

38:24.552 --> 38:25.636
Help me out.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.305
Hermey's the elf that makes toys,
but really wants to be a dentist.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.682
The little gay dude!

38:30.350 --> 38:31.475
He's not gay!

38:31.685 --> 38:34.395
- Rollie, are you trying to tell me you're gay?
- I'm not gay!

38:34.479 --> 38:35.854
He's really not.

38:36.564 --> 38:41.819
In any event, Raylan, when I was a kid,
Hermey kind of inspired me.

38:42.862 --> 38:49.243
I got picture books about dentistry
and little-kid dentist tools and...

38:51.329 --> 38:54.373
Well, eventually I forgot it.
I grew out of it, but...

38:55.166 --> 39:00.421
But when I walked into that bar
in Brownsville and I saw it on the TV,

39:02.173 --> 39:05.592
it was like a message from heaven
telling me what I had to do.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.596
It's all right, you can laugh now.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.057
Well, why would I laugh?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.104
You hear that?

39:18.064 --> 39:19.231
I don't hear anything.

39:19.691 --> 39:24.361
Exactly. It's a whole lot of nothing.
You know what that means, right?

39:25.363 --> 39:29.742
He's moving.
He's gonna get us from the other side.

39:30.618 --> 39:34.246
No, no. He's just waiting this thing out
just like we are!

39:35.206 --> 39:36.457
He only wants me, Ray.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.961
You know these pros,
they get their target, then they're gone.

39:41.046 --> 39:45.257
Unless he has to come down here
and someone sees him.

39:45.967 --> 39:49.636
If that's the case, then after he kills me,
he's gonna kill you and Mindy.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.555
No, he's not. No, he's not.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.393
Rollie, what the hell are you doing?

39:56.603 --> 39:59.730
I'm done running. I've had my fun.
I'm ready to turn myself in.

39:59.814 --> 40:00.898
Rollie!

40:00.982 --> 40:02.775
Being a greeter at Wal-Mart
won't be all bad.

40:02.942 --> 40:03.984
Baby, what are you doing?

40:04.152 --> 40:06.153
Now, you get those handcuffs ready, Ray!

40:06.321 --> 40:07.446
Rollie! Don't! Damn it.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.574
God damn it.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.576
I love you, Mindy!

40:14.621 --> 40:17.790
Rollie! Rollie, Rollie!

40:18.666 --> 40:20.918
No! No!

40:21.002 --> 40:22.961
No! Rollie!

40:23.588 --> 40:24.630
Quick!

40:25.673 --> 40:26.673
Rollie!

40:27.425 --> 40:29.093
Rollie? Please, no!

40:30.512 --> 40:31.595
Rollie!

40:58.957 --> 40:59.998
It fit?

41:02.001 --> 41:03.043
No.
