we really need to

00:13.581 --> 00:15.449
talk about something
non-wedding related.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.932
Oh, it's perfect.

all our criteria.

maybe a fresh

Also, wet and stinky feet are
not in Lea's dream wedding.

probably true.

how's the baby?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.023

is stable.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.558
Okay. Next step,
get her down to imaging.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.961
We need a surgical plan for
these pelvic fractures

hopefully removable.

you're talking
to anybody else.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.283

11:23.416 --> 11:27.220
I was myself,
and up close
and personal,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.122
Debbie didn't like
what she saw.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.959
She...

11:32.092 --> 11:35.729
She said I was
controlling and selfish.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.299
Did you tell her
she was right?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.501
Well, yeah,
'cause she was.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.136
It didn't help.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.338
What's in Montana?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.142
Pine trees
and cowboy boots and

11:49.777 --> 11:51.644
change for me.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.681
In Montana,
no one knows me,

11:54.815 --> 11:56.784
and I have no history,

11:56.917 --> 12:01.321
and no one has
any expectations of me.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.357
You've done this before.
After Maddie.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.693
That's not fair.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.161
I know.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.364
But my therapist
would say you're

12:11.498 --> 12:12.866
"pulling a geographic."

12:13.000 --> 12:14.167
Has your therapist
met me?

12:17.037 --> 12:20.173
I have to go prepare
for Sunil's procedure.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.815
The safest path
is external fixation.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.283
We'd use a metal frame to
stabilize the fractured bones

12:30.417 --> 12:32.285
until your baby
is ready to be delivered.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.821
You'd need three weeks
of bed rest,

12:33.954 --> 12:36.089
and you'll likely develop
debilitating arthritis.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.724
There's a significant chance
you will never

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
have full mobility
ever again, bu...

12:39.426 --> 12:41.594
I have grad school.
A job. This baby.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.530
That can't be
the only option.
No, it's not.

12:43.663 --> 12:47.267
I was going to tell you,
if we do a C-section now,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.102
we could do
an internal fixation,

12:49.236 --> 12:50.770
which would greatly
improve your chances

12:50.904 --> 12:52.973
of walking
without assistance.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.109
Though it does increase
the risk of complications

12:56.243 --> 12:58.211
associated with
premature birth.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.281
So I either never
walk right again,

13:01.414 --> 13:03.050
or I jeopardize
my baby's life?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.785
Yes.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.855
You have to decide.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.194
My boyfriend,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.229
at first, he didn't
want to keep our girl.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.132
But then
he came around to it.

13:19.266 --> 13:23.070
We said that we'd
figure it out together.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.638
Then he signs up for
this month-long research trip

13:25.772 --> 13:28.241

and here I am.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.513

myself or my baby.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.418
No, you have
to choose.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.322
I can't.

No. I also have a patient
who won't decide
on a surgical plan.

to Lea?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.306
Yeah, of course.

give me your advice.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.846

need my advice.

Sometimes I do.

You don't like to
give it to me anymore.

are partners now.

You can talk to her,

of stuff she's gotta
talk to you about.

things you need to tell me.

16:00.093 --> 16:05.032
Uh, I didn't go
on a business trip
a couple weeks ago.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.137
I went to Montana
to find Glassman

16:10.270 --> 16:12.239
and convince him
to come home.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.744
Because I was really
worried about you.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.581
What were
you worried about?

so many changes
at the hospital,

hard for...

struggling with them.

that her baby died

38:58.269 --> 38:59.771

expired meds...

38:59.905 --> 39:03.308
Dr. Lim, until we've done
a thorough M&M

39:03.442 --> 39:05.644
and identified what changes
need to be made,

39:07.012 --> 39:09.214
discretion is in
everyone's best interest.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.320
Are you suggesting
we not tell her the truth?

39:15.454 --> 39:17.989
I'm suggesting we all
have exposure.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.791
You, the residents.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.696
Audrey,

39:26.598 --> 39:27.799
this is a tragic day.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.002
But we cannot allow
a single event

39:31.136 --> 39:33.304
to derail
everything we do here.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.957
Salen made cuts.

It just...

39:56.261 --> 39:57.629

the cracks.

Expired!

40:07.238 --> 40:08.273
Expired!

40:09.007 --> 40:10.208
They're all useless!

40:10.341 --> 40:11.677
Shaun.
No!

40:11.810 --> 40:13.545
Shaun, stop,
stop, stop, stop!
They're all... No!

40:13.679 --> 40:15.881
It wasn't your...
It wasn't your fault!
N-N... Please! Please! No!

40:16.014 --> 40:18.584
There's nothing more
you could have done!
No, you lied to me!

40:18.717 --> 40:20.051
I can't trust you!

40:21.520 --> 40:22.988
And I can't marry you.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.235
You're hyperventilating.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.837
Look at me.
Look at me.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.872
Look at me.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.874
Take a deep breath
now, okay?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.143
Take a deep breath.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.377
(BREATHING SLOWER)
There you go.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.079
You can talk to me.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.548
Dr. Glassman,

40:52.584 --> 40:54.586
you... you are a...

40:56.154 --> 40:57.723
An awful best man

40:58.890 --> 41:01.026
and a terrible mentor.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.595
You said you would never
abandon me, but that's a lie.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.396
A lie.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.098
That is a lie!

41:07.232 --> 41:09.968
Why is everyone
lying to me? Why?

41:10.101 --> 41:12.971
You should have been
running the hospital!

41:13.104 --> 41:14.973
If you had, the baby
would not have died!
