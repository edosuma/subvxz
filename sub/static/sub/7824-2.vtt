Then I found out about Dimoxinil

02:47.510 --> 02:49.270
Well, we do have a product

which is more
in <i>your price range.</i>

However, I must assure
you that any hair growth

02:53.190 --> 02:54.790
<i>you experience

02:54.850 --> 02:56.580
will be purely coincidental.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.350

03:19.410 --> 03:21.880
Hey, Lenny,

all of your tartar sauce?

03:21.950 --> 03:23.820
Dry fish sticks. This sucks.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.440
Quit complaining, chrome dome.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.790
If I had hair

03:26.850 --> 03:28.560

To Mr. Burns, that's one
less ivory back scratcher.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.270
Yeah. Besides, you pay into the
insurance fund every week.

03:45.340 --> 03:47.280
What do you ever get out of it?

03:47.340 --> 03:49.340
Nothing. Well, that newsletter.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.420
I love you, Homer!

10:17.500 --> 10:20.570
I love you, Karl... Marge.

10:20.630 --> 10:21.800
Proceed, Smithers.

10:21.870 --> 10:24.570
Our first issue, sir,
is our low productivity

10:24.640 --> 10:25.740
and record-high

10:25.800 --> 10:26.530
<i>worker accident rate.</i>

10:26.610 --> 10:28.910
Guh!....Any suggestions?

10:28.970 --> 10:31.100
A round of layoffs might
wake up the idiots.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.750
We can put caffeine in
the water cooler.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.520
Those are my ideas!

10:34.580 --> 10:36.650
You people don't think,
you regurgitate!

10:36.720 --> 10:38.820
That's why I promoted someone
who's in touch with the workers.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.580
You.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.460
I think you mean him, sir.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.260
You then.
How would you improve
the workers' situation?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.980
Well, I...

10:46.060 --> 10:48.460
well, sir, for one thing,
we had a problem
every Tuesday

10:48.530 --> 10:50.770
when the cafeteria
would serve fish sticks...

10:50.830 --> 10:53.070
Fish sticks! What in blazes are
you talking about?!

10:53.130 --> 10:55.370
Well sir, they cut the
head off the fish

10:55.430 --> 10:56.830
and chop up the rest
of the sticks and then
put seasoned bread crumbs--

10:56.900 --> 10:58.610
I know what fish sticks are!

10:58.670 --> 11:00.140
<i>Get to the point!</i>

11:00.210 --> 11:02.680
You only get this tiny

11:02.740 --> 11:03.940
<i>little cup of tartar sauce
to dip them in</i>

11:04.010 --> 11:05.080
and I always run out.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.300
Will you stop
wasting our time, Simpson.

11:06.380 --> 11:07.920
Shut up, Smithers.

11:07.980 --> 11:10.420
Can't you see what he's saying?
A happy worker is a busy worker.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.750
Three cents' worth
of tartar sauce

11:12.820 --> 11:15.120
could save us thousands
of man-hours in labor.

11:15.190 --> 11:17.460
I like the cut
of your jib, Simpson.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.720
Let the fools
have their tartar sauce.

11:21.790 --> 11:24.460
Enjoy your
tartar sauce, boys.
Enjoy!

11:24.530 --> 11:25.370
Give me your plates.

11:25.430 --> 11:26.830
Don't crowd.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.300
Plenty for everybody!

11:29.700 --> 11:31.370
Hmm, brilliant.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.210
Who could ever have imagined
that Simpson's sweeping reforms

11:35.270 --> 11:37.200
would pay off so quickly?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.850
You know sir,
accidents decreased
by exactly the number

11:39.910 --> 11:41.120
that Simpson himself

11:41.180 --> 11:42.980
has known or suspected
to have caused last month.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.790
And our output level
was just as high

11:44.850 --> 11:46.550
during Simpson's last vacation.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.520
My dear, tired old Smithers...

11:48.590 --> 11:51.160
do I detect a note of jealousy?

11:51.220 --> 11:52.580
( <i>laughing )</i>

11:52.660 --> 11:54.030
It is time.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.960
Give Simpson...

11:56.030 --> 11:57.500
the key.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.890
Karl:
Mr. Simpson

11:58.960 --> 11:59.960
don't sit on
that filthy thing

12:00.030 --> 12:00.840
one second longer.

12:00.900 --> 12:04.610
They've given you <i>the key.</i>

12:04.670 --> 12:06.510
<i>The key?!</i>

12:06.570 --> 12:07.910
Who's got the key?

12:11.780 --> 12:12.980
( <i>all gasping )</i>

12:24.060 --> 12:25.260
Karl:
Stunning.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.390
Absolutely stunning.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.300
Hey, ho, men.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.120
You know I was watching
the Dumont last night

12:33.200 --> 12:34.970
<i>and I happened to catch
a fascinating documentary</i>

12:35.030 --> 12:36.690
on Rommel, The Desert Fox.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.840
Now there's a man
who could get things done.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.160
Towel, please, Simpson.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.340
Allow me, sir.

12:41.410 --> 12:42.980
I said <i>Simpson.</i>

12:43.040 --> 12:45.980
Sure thing, Mr. Burns.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.840
Well done, Simpson.

12:47.910 --> 12:49.340
Now walk behind me
down the hallway.

12:49.410 --> 12:50.810
Can do, sir.

13:21.150 --> 13:22.780
<i>"$1,000?</i>

13:22.850 --> 13:24.080
<i>"Dimoxinil?</i>

13:24.150 --> 13:25.750
<i>Keep brain from freezing?"</i>

13:25.820 --> 13:28.120
Now I've got you, Simpson.

13:28.190 --> 13:29.490
( <i>laughing )</i>

13:32.140 --> 13:35.280
m Homer, between your hair
care products and new wardrobe

13:35.340 --> 13:37.440
we're not saving anything
for a rainy day.

13:37.510 --> 13:41.190
Rainy day! There's never going
to be a rainy day, Marge.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.750
There's not a cloud
in the Simpson sky.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.690
And what does
my little girl want?

13:45.750 --> 13:48.480
An absence of mood swings
and some stability in my life.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.290
How about a pony?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.630
Okay.

13:51.690 --> 13:53.420
<i>Burns:
I want you to weave</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:55.930
that patented Simpson magic
with my executives.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.100
A short speech.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.070
Work, work, work.
You know.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.230
Okay, what the hey?

13:59.300 --> 14:00.470
Excellent.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.670
Set you to your task, Simpson.

14:04.470 --> 14:07.400
Uh, Mr. Burns,
it is my sad duty

14:07.480 --> 14:09.850
to report that one
of your executives

14:09.910 --> 14:11.250
has bilked the company insurance
plan out of $1,000.

14:11.310 --> 14:14.640
What?!
Blast his hide to Hades!

14:14.720 --> 14:17.250
I was going to buy
that ivory back scratcher.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.720
How did he do it?

14:18.790 --> 14:20.260
He charged the company
for Dimoxinil.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.530
It's a baldness cure.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.590
Thank you very much,
professor science.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.600
I know what Dimoxinil is.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.230
Now, go make an example
of this hooligan.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.400
With pleasure, sir.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.170
Karl, you got to help me.

14:32.230 --> 14:35.800
Mr. Burns wants me to make
some speech to his executives...

14:35.870 --> 14:36.740
What do you want?

14:36.810 --> 14:38.280
Just thought I'd drop by

14:38.340 --> 14:39.210
to tell you that you're fired.

14:39.270 --> 14:40.400
What?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.750
Our company does not
look kindly upon $1,000

14:42.810 --> 14:44.250
worth of insurance fraud.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.270
Clean out your desk
by noon, Simpson.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.250
Wait, Mr. Smithers.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.790
Homer Simpson is innocent.

14:49.850 --> 14:51.020
I did this.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.860
You did?
What are you
talking about?

14:52.920 --> 14:55.630
Mr. Simpson was unaware
of any impropriety.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.330
I take full responsibility.

14:57.390 --> 14:58.660
Really?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.030
Oh.

15:00.090 --> 15:02.620
Well, then, you're fired,
whoever you are.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.640
Here's your $1,000.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.070
Hey, what do you care
if this guy's bald?

15:08.140 --> 15:10.710
My reasons... are my own.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.570
Karl, you saved me.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.210
Why?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.650
Have I done something
extraordinary here today?

15:18.710 --> 15:19.770
No.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.320
I did what I was born to do--

15:21.380 --> 15:23.780
what any good soldier
would have done

15:23.850 --> 15:25.090
when a live grenade

15:25.150 --> 15:26.250
threatened his commander.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.260
I threw myself upon it

15:28.320 --> 15:30.820
and bore its terrible brunt.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.600
Thanks, Karl.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.170
I don't know what to say.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.770
Just walk me to my car.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.930
Bye, Karl.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.940
I'm going to miss you.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.530
Bye, Mr. Simpson.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.780
Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you
bring an umbrella today?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.780
D-ohh! No.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.780
Here.

16:03.490 --> 16:06.200
Okay, okay, okay, you're broke.
You're flat broke.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.830
You don't have Karl anymore.
He's not here, but you've
got your hair.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.100
That's right.
It's all about hair.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.390
Oh, that big speech.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.040
Aha!

16:23.110 --> 16:25.850
<i>Hey, what's happening,
hep cats?</i>

16:25.910 --> 16:26.810
<i>No way!</i>

16:26.880 --> 16:28.150
It's gotta be a fake.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.120
It's like realsville, Daddy-o.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.490
Bart!

16:37.560 --> 16:38.500
What are you doing?

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
Uh-oh.

16:39.630 --> 16:40.660
( screams )
<i>Aaahh!</i>

16:40.730 --> 16:41.300
Why, you little...

16:41.360 --> 16:41.920
Uh-oh.

16:43.130 --> 16:47.040
( <i>Bart screaming )</i>

16:47.100 --> 16:48.310
Boy... must...

16:48.370 --> 16:49.110
die!

16:49.170 --> 16:50.810
I love you, Dad.

16:50.870 --> 16:51.580
D-oh!

16:51.640 --> 16:53.910
Dirty trick.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.450
Okay. I'm not gonna kill you

16:56.510 --> 16:57.820
but I'm going to tell you
three things

16:57.880 --> 17:00.770
that are going to haunt you
for the rest of your days.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.340
You've ruined your father.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.970
You've crippled your family

17:04.040 --> 17:05.410
and baldness is hereditary.

17:05.470 --> 17:06.940
It is?!

17:09.109 --> 17:10.380
( <i>sobbing )</i>

17:10.440 --> 17:13.650
Oh, Homer, why don't you
just call the pharmacy.

17:13.710 --> 17:15.720
I don't have 1,000 bucks!

17:15.780 --> 17:18.349
But you do, don't you, Marge?
You do. You do...

17:18.420 --> 17:20.150
You've been squirreling it away,
haven't you?

17:20.220 --> 17:22.819
Saving it for a rainy day,
that's what you've said,
right, right?

17:22.890 --> 17:24.020
Homer!

17:24.089 --> 17:26.359
( sobbing )

17:26.420 --> 17:30.250
Dad is taking this
in a less-than-heroic fashion.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.610
Marge:
Oh, Homie, I'm so sorry.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.880
Got that big speech
in five minutes,
Simpson huh?

17:47.950 --> 17:50.620
You're not going
to hang yourself, are you?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.020
D-ohh!

17:52.080 --> 17:53.510
Huh?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.490
Karl:
<i>"Dear Mr. Simpson</i>

17:56.550 --> 17:59.150
<i>"I've taken the liberty
of preparing your speech</i>

17:59.220 --> 18:01.790
<i>"on the enclosed
numbered three-by-five cards.</i>

18:01.860 --> 18:03.630
<i>"all the big words
are spelled...</i>

18:03.700 --> 18:05.630
"pho-en-ne-net-tically.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.200
<i>"God bless you.</i>

18:07.270 --> 18:11.000
<i>"You are one of Springfield's
very special creatures.</i>

18:11.070 --> 18:14.110
<i>Your obedient servant, Karl."</i>

18:14.170 --> 18:15.040
Good luck, sir.

18:15.110 --> 18:16.740
Ah!
Karl.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.850
So that wasn't just a
sweet voice I heard
inside my head.

18:18.910 --> 18:20.310
What are <i>you doing here?</i>

18:20.380 --> 18:22.950
I just came to say good-bye
to the gals in the typing pool.

18:23.010 --> 18:26.210
Yeah, well.
Thanks for the speech, Karl
but I can't give it.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.340
Look at me.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.120
I guess I haven't
taught you anything.

18:29.190 --> 18:30.520
What do you mean?

18:30.590 --> 18:32.360
Don't you see?
The tartar sauce,
the bathroom key

18:32.420 --> 18:33.680
drying your boss's hands.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.030
You did it all.

18:35.090 --> 18:36.750
It was never the hair.

18:36.830 --> 18:40.530
You did it because you believed
you could and you still can.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.770
No I can't.
I'm just a big fool.

18:41.830 --> 18:42.790
Oh no, you're not.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.170
How do you know?

18:44.240 --> 18:47.440
Because my mother taught me
to never kiss a fool.

18:47.510 --> 18:48.280
Karl.

18:48.340 --> 18:49.910
Now go get them, tiger.

18:49.970 --> 18:51.600
( <i>growls )</i>

18:53.210 --> 18:55.850
And now with some fresh insights

18:55.910 --> 18:58.910
one of the rising young stars
of our nuclear family

18:58.980 --> 19:00.280
Homer Simpson.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.780
What in blazes?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.510
Who is that old geezer?

19:04.590 --> 19:06.860
What has he done
with Homer Simpson?

19:06.920 --> 19:08.550
He <i>is Homer Simpson, sir.</i>

19:08.630 --> 19:09.830
( <i>clears throat )</i>

19:09.890 --> 19:11.590
Uh, a lot of you

19:11.660 --> 19:13.790
would think I was crazy
if I did this.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.000
He's crazy!

19:15.070 --> 19:17.040
Yet we at this power plant

19:17.100 --> 19:18.570
are doing this
every hour of every day.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.980
Bloated inventories,
outmoded production methods.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.610
I can save this company
millions of dollars a year.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.610
How?

19:25.680 --> 19:26.810
Through <i>Jiko Kandri</i>

19:26.880 --> 19:28.720
the Japanese art
of self-management.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.720
This bald man
has no ideas.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.420
If this is a joke,
I'm not laughing.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.480
Some nerve--
telling us how to run the plant.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.980
He doesn't even have hair.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.880
...inefficiently mining uranium

19:38.960 --> 19:42.130
that can be purchased quite
cheaply on the foreign market.

19:42.190 --> 19:43.520
The long-term benefits

19:43.590 --> 19:45.420
more than offsetting
the one-time cost

19:45.500 --> 19:48.540
for a net savings
of five thousand, two...

19:48.600 --> 19:51.040
( <i>mumbling )</i>

19:51.100 --> 19:52.040
...lots of money.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.230
Mr. Burns' office.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.730
Right now.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.110
Dead man coming through.

19:59.180 --> 20:01.250
Mr. Burns:
<i>Well, well, well</i>

20:01.310 --> 20:04.910
our dashing
young "junior" executive.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.740
You made a hollow mockery
of our morning meeting, Simpson.

20:06.820 --> 20:09.060
I should fire you on the spot.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.360
But...

20:10.420 --> 20:11.560
I'm not going to.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.320
Uh, why?

20:13.390 --> 20:15.560
Simpsons, how old
do you think I am?

20:15.630 --> 20:17.900
I don't know. 102?

20:17.960 --> 20:20.090
I'm only 81.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.360
You may find this
hard to believe

20:22.430 --> 20:25.600
but in my salad days

20:25.670 --> 20:26.840
my crowning glory

20:26.900 --> 20:30.200
was a bright shock
of strawberry blonde curls.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.670
Oh, I was big man on campus
until my senior year

20:33.740 --> 20:36.310
when I became as bald
as a plucked chicken.

20:36.380 --> 20:37.580
You see, Simpson

20:37.650 --> 20:42.620
I, too, know the sting
of male pattern baldness.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.630
That's why I'm giving you
your old job back.

20:45.690 --> 20:46.790
What?

20:46.860 --> 20:48.730
Oh, thank you, thank you.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.790
Now get out of here
before I reconsider.

20:51.700 --> 20:52.630
Oh.

20:52.700 --> 20:53.430
Better hurry up.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.640
( <i>Homer mumbling )</i>

20:56.700 --> 20:58.740
Homer, are you
still awake?

20:58.800 --> 21:00.600
I've never been
more awake in my life.

21:00.670 --> 21:01.710
What's wrong?

21:01.770 --> 21:03.270
Are you kidding?

21:03.340 --> 21:06.410
I'm stuck
in that dead-end job again.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.880
The kids are going to hate me

21:07.950 --> 21:12.690
'cause I can't buy them
all that stuff I promised them

21:12.750 --> 21:13.690
and you're not going
to love me as much

21:13.750 --> 21:15.990
'cause I'm ugly and bald.

21:16.050 --> 21:17.850
Oh, Homer.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.690
Your job has always
put food on our table

21:20.760 --> 21:23.000
<i>and the kids
will get over it.</i>

21:23.060 --> 21:24.330
And?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.330
And what about loving me?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.670
Oh, Homer, I...

21:27.730 --> 21:29.000
Come here.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.340
