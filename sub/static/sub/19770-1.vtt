02:06.984 --> 02:08.455
Darling?

02:08.555 --> 02:09.183
Huh?

02:09.282 --> 02:13.298
I hear you were having drinks with the
butler the other night.

02:13.398 --> 02:16.081
Now you know that sort of thing
leads to anarchy

02:16.181 --> 02:17.158
Mom.

02:17.358 --> 02:21.201
One has to keep the distance
between them and us.

02:21.401 --> 02:23.055
It all human beings.

02:23.255 --> 02:25.228
Servants.

02:25.428 --> 02:29.550
Oh, isn't it terrible darling?
Two more people have disappeared.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.552
Oh really?
Were the "us's" or "them's"

02:32.752 --> 02:36.663
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk.
You're late for college.

02:36.863 --> 02:41.654
Mom? When are you going to let me
have some coffee in the morning?

02:41.754 --> 02:46.160
When, you're a big boy.
I mean you know it's bad for you.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.456
But mom, I need the
caffine! Badly!

02:50.656 --> 02:55.994
I'll think about it. Now run
along darling.

03:04.597 --> 03:07.547
- Your books master Loftmore.
- Thank you Jenkins.

03:07.647 --> 03:12.575
and your coff... excuse me.
Caffine sir.

03:12.775 --> 03:12.734
Thank you.

03:16.016 --> 03:19.109
...and uh. Your nicotine.

03:19.309 --> 03:22.191
- Thank you.
- Allow me sir.

03:23.545 --> 03:27.467
Will you be wanting your,
wheels today sir?

03:27.667 --> 03:30.563
Not today Jenkins.
I need the fresh air.

03:30.563 --> 03:34.100
Have a nice day, sir.

03:42.986 --> 03:44.860
I saw the greatest movie
with Mark last night?

03:44.860 --> 03:47.308
- With Mark?
- He still likes you.

03:47.308 --> 03:49.460
I don't give a shit.
The guy's a slob

03:49.762 --> 03:53.331
He doesn't know how to spell
"LADY", let alone treat me like one.

03:53.531 --> 03:54.350
You know, the last time
we went out

03:54.350 --> 03:56.359
he actually made me
pay for a drink.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.607
- He did?
- Yes! I'm sure.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.315
What I need is an older man.
Something with class.

04:03.515 --> 04:05.903
A little style. Someone who
knows how to treat a lady.

04:05.903 --> 04:06.969
- Businessman
- Doctor

04:06.969 --> 04:07.675
- Doctor
- Lawyer

04:07.675 --> 04:08.553
- Lawyer - Doctor
I don't care

04:08.553 --> 04:09.523
Yeah. Okay

04:09.723 --> 04:10.723
Yeah.

04:10.923 --> 04:11.923
So why are you
dating Johnathan?

04:12.123 --> 04:15.490
Dating? Grow up Sarah.
One night of fun.

04:15.490 --> 04:18.254
Anyway, Johnny may have
a lot of class, but...

04:18.254 --> 04:18.915
But?

04:18.615 --> 04:21.778
...but he still has something
Mark hasn't.

04:21.978 --> 04:23.745
What's that?

04:23.945 --> 04:27.019
A body. I mean we're talking
major body here.

04:27.019 --> 04:29.246
China, you're awful!
Your'e the worse!

04:29.246 --> 04:30.540
No!

04:34.278 --> 04:37.057
Strange. I have never seen that before

04:37.257 --> 04:40.196
Yeah. A weird place for a waxwork.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.409
Maybe they don't like customers.

04:46.796 --> 04:49.124
I'm sorry ladies.
Did I startle you?

04:49.124 --> 04:51.793
A heart attack maybe.
Startle? No.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.884
I see you are interrested
in my waxworks. Yes?

04:54.884 --> 04:58.334
Yeah. In fact we were just saying it's
kind of a weird place to have one.

04:58.534 --> 05:01.814
I mean, on a street like this.

05:02.614 --> 05:04.331
Really? Why?

05:04.331 --> 05:09.604
The customers and that.
We got to get back to class.

05:09.604 --> 05:13.320
Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Mister...

05:13.320 --> 05:14.873
Mister?

05:15.073 --> 05:18.522
Come on China

05:20.128 --> 05:24.450
I am having a private showing
tonight. At midnight.

05:24.984 --> 05:28.806
Good time. After dinner,
but before breakfast.

05:28.806 --> 05:33.948
You can bring some friends, of course.
No more than six though.

05:33.948 --> 05:36.254
Otherwise I'm afraid we might be a bit full.

05:36.254 --> 05:38.218
Oh. You're expecting a crowd.

05:38.418 --> 05:42.022
Like I said, no more than six.

05:45.333 --> 05:49.395
See you at midnight then.

05:52.518 --> 05:57.487
Wooooh Scaaary.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.752
- 'morning Mark.
- How ya felling?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.017
Late.

06:04.217 --> 06:10.513
I June of 1941. Hitler's operation
Barbarossa attacked the Soviet Union

06:10.513 --> 06:13.468
and the Baltic states simultaneously.

06:13.668 --> 06:16.412
In just a matter of a few days

06:16.612 --> 06:21.440
the Lituanians fell under the
assault of the Nazi Blitzkrieg.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.742
The German occupation and
Hitler's announcement

06:25.942 --> 06:31.107
of an Ostland Republic means
the end of Lithuanian culture.

06:31.107 --> 06:33.302
but he was just a little bit too late.

06:33.302 --> 06:36.260
Good afternoon Herr Loftmore.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.400
Good morning sir.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.714
You obviously know all about
the Lithuanian struggle.

06:40.714 --> 06:43.258
Otherwise you would have
attended the first 15 minutes

06:43.258 --> 06:44.448
of the geschichte! Yah?

06:44.448 --> 06:45.489
Yes sir.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.243
Good. Tomorrow I want a 20
page essay on the subject

06:49.243 --> 06:52.423
now sit down.
- Thank you sir.

06:58.666 --> 07:01.236
Thanks for that phone call that
I never recieved last night.

07:03.152 --> 07:04.662
My memory must be going.

07:04.662 --> 07:06.796
I don't remember Johnathan
letting me use his phone.

07:24.424 --> 07:09.276
Oh. That's gotta hurt.

07:09.276 --> 07:12.082
You went out with
Johnathan last night?

07:12.082 --> 07:13.306
What! Are you crazy?

07:13.306 --> 07:16.256
...and Mr. Loftmore.
I nearly forgot!

07:16.256 --> 07:21.192
I also want a 40 page essay
on the trouble with dictators.

07:27.486 --> 07:30.126
I can't believe she went out
with that monster last night.

07:30.126 --> 07:31.598
Forget her Mark.
She's a bitch.

07:31.598 --> 07:32.956
I told her, her phone rang.

07:32.956 --> 07:36.504
Look at that. You got on top of you,
you have a better chance with a steamer.

07:36.504 --> 07:38.010
Heh. You know what
they say about

07:38.010 --> 07:39.851
body builders man.
Thig big.

07:39.851 --> 07:41.470
Stop being so foul.

07:41.470 --> 07:44.112
Hah. The virgin has spoken.

07:44.112 --> 07:45.167
Hey.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.689
Hey, is it true what they
say about body builders?

07:47.889 --> 07:53.071
Well, that's for me to know.
Why didn't you let me off?

07:53.071 --> 07:55.893
Give it a break China!
Okay?

07:55.893 --> 07:57.648
Geez. Can't even take a joke.

07:57.848 --> 07:59.958
Save it for thepowder room babe.
This man is in pain.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.072
They're both being real assholes.

08:02.272 --> 08:03.455
- Thank you Sarah

08:03.455 --> 08:05.146

08:05.308 --> 08:06.988
A little of that back row boogie?

08:06.988 --> 08:10.284
Oh, I don't know handsome.
I'm a little tired.

08:10.284 --> 08:12.463
Me too, after last night.

08:12.463 --> 08:15.046
Hey Mark. Wanna go play catch?

08:15.046 --> 08:16.871
Incapable of doing that as well.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.885
Alright, don't do it superman.
You couldn't count one night man.

08:19.885 --> 08:21.403
Hey Mark, I see you made
a new friend.

08:19.885 --> 08:23.128
I hope he'll fit though
the front door.

08:23.128 --> 08:28.166
Yeah. So now, no more jokes.
Okay, this poor guy is in pain.

08:33.938 --> 08:35.182
What's happening tonight guys.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.203
Nothing.
I gave up drinking.

08:37.203 --> 08:37.995
Third time this month.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.573
Yay, ya know I was thinking a
renting a horror film.

08:39.573 --> 08:40.115
What do ya say?

08:40.115 --> 08:41.136
Ohh. That's a new idea.

08:41.136 --> 08:43.110
Sounds alright.
How about you Macus?

08:43.110 --> 08:47.202
60 pages on Lithuanian
Dictators, or something...

08:48.194 --> 08:51.333
Well. Sarah and I were invited to
a late night waxworks show

08:51.333 --> 08:52.945
by the handsomest gentleman.

08:52.945 --> 08:53.795
No kidding?

08:53.795 --> 08:58.861
Hmm. It's a private show though.
We can bring a few select friends.

09:00.275 --> 09:02.629
Nah. Waxworks are out of date.
This is the video sage

09:02.629 --> 09:03.702
Well, Sarah and I are going.

09:03.702 --> 09:04.801
I bet you can.

09:04.801 --> 09:09.798
Oh you bet. We all can't be
such modern people.

09:10.163 --> 09:11.294
Come on Mark.

09:11.294 --> 09:12.703

09:12.703 --> 09:14.261

09:23.929 --> 09:26.959
What's the rush babe? Got a date
with Johnathan after the show?

09:26.959 --> 09:31.298
Can't a girl get laid around here
without getting burned at the stake?

09:31.669 --> 09:34.687
Anybody got a match?

09:35.801 --> 09:40.531
I do what I want, when I want.
Dig it or fuck off.

09:45.266 --> 09:49.835
- Ah-Ho!
- Lets' *******!

09:58.618 --> 10:00.111
We need to talk.

10:00.111 --> 10:02.957
- Yeah, about what?
- About what. About us.

10:02.957 --> 10:04.395
'Us' is over.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.099
You had your chance.
You blew it.

10:06.099 --> 10:07.131
Right.

10:07.131 --> 10:09.502

10:09.502 --> 10:12.708
Not, "Hey, how about a
pizza after class babe".

10:12.708 --> 10:16.249
I'm like for something just a
little more in a man.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.187
A little "je ne sais quoi".

10:18.871 --> 10:20.712
A little what?

10:20.912 --> 10:23.255
See? You don't even speak French.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.420
Oh, I'm sorry I am not that

10:24.420 --> 10:26.487
good at languages. Okay?
- Yeah, well why should I

10:26.487 --> 10:28.390
suffer for that?

10:28.390 --> 10:32.652
Suffer? We're living in America.

10:33.614 --> 10:40.775
Mark. You are very sweet.
But you just don't get it.

10:44.973 --> 10:47.671
Shit.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.971
Nice place for a waxworks

11:04.971 --> 11:07.327
Yeah. That's what we said.

11:07.527 --> 11:10.513
It looks a little bit spooky boys,
you think we should do this?

11:10.713 --> 11:14.834
Never fear. Tony is here.
Ladies first.

11:14.834 --> 11:18.231
Woah. What a gentleman.
I think I'll play feminist tonight.

11:18.431 --> 11:21.604
Guys, could we clear this up a little bit?
I'm a little worried about my maid's

11:21.604 --> 11:23.970
knowledge of Lithuania. Okay?

11:23.970 --> 11:27.516
Well if you are in such a rush darling,

11:27.516 --> 11:33.751
- Okay toots. I will.

11:56.894 --> 12:01.381
Guys. If I am going to play the hero,
at least give me a little room.

12:01.381 --> 12:05.844
- Safety in numbers man.
- Right.

12:17.317 --> 12:19.687
You know I...

12:19.867 --> 12:22.318
What was that about
safety in numbers?

12:22.318 --> 12:23.378
So were thickle.

12:23.578 --> 12:24.799
James, I want to go home.

12:24.999 --> 12:28.108
What? It was your idea
to come in the first place.

12:28.108 --> 12:30.547
Yeah, but this is not my idea of fun.

12:30.547 --> 12:32.793
Come on Gems, let's just take a look.

12:32.793 --> 12:37.467
No.

12:38.363 --> 12:44.151
Women.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.194
Oh Shit.

12:52.194 --> 12:54.035

12:54.035 --> 12:57.455
Welcome to the Waxwork.

12:57.455 --> 13:01.612
Uh. Wrong picture Tony.

13:13.850 --> 13:19.887
We were expecting more.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.935
Please sit down.

13:39.135 --> 13:42.779
Make yourself comfortable.

13:42.979 --> 13:46.257
A Drink for anyone?

13:50.723 --> 13:55.437

13:55.987 --> 14:00.029

14:06.051 --> 14:08.120
Big Party

14:08.120 --> 14:10.514

What do you want?

14:10.514 --> 14:12.261
If those guys are waxworks.

14:12.261 --> 14:14.873
They definately improved them
since I was a kid.

14:14.873 --> 14:17.642
Oh yeah? Well you didn't
have to come, you know.

14:17.642 --> 14:20.170

love to taken your place.

14:20.170 --> 14:21.873
Yes darling. And who were
you expecting?

14:21.873 --> 14:27.833
Maurice Chevalier?
"...thank heaven for little girls..."

14:27.833 --> 14:30.913
I don't think so babe

14:36.005 --> 14:39.037
Well this time, I really don't

14:39.037 --> 14:41.897
Must be what we came for.

16:35.964 --> 16:39.896
This, is killer.

16:57.585 --> 17:01.920
They won't mind if I go in for my lighter.

17:17.233 --> 17:22.785
Alright. Who put the acid in
my drink again... ...China?

17:23.833 --> 17:27.884
Wait a minute.
I gave up drinking.

17:31.544 --> 17:33.495
Hologram?

17:33.495 --> 17:37.586
No. A hologram.
Right...

17:38.997 --> 17:41.133
Hypnotism.

17:41.333 --> 17:46.343
Hypnotism. That's it. Alright.
I'm hypnotized. Alright.

17:46.343 --> 17:50.745
Well, uh. I hope you guys can hear me.

Okay. Um.

18:03.897 --> 18:06.089

18:57.875 --> 19:01.229
Jack. I know your father
was my dearest friend,

19:01.429 --> 19:04.309
but you can do
nothing to help me.

19:04.509 --> 19:06.996

You got the wrong  guy man.

19:06.996 --> 19:09.215
Jack!
You must run jack.

19:09.215 --> 19:12.342
As far as you can.

19:13.241 --> 19:16.901
The full moon has already risen.

19:16.901 --> 19:21.948
In a few moments. A ???
could happen.

19:21.948 --> 19:28.515
It feels cold in here.

19:28.715 --> 19:28.783
Why don't I just mosey on out?
Get some wood. We'll talk.

19:31.088 --> 19:36.754
It is...
...too late.

19:41.839 --> 19:47.222
Relax. Go outside.
I'll get the wood,

19:47.222 --> 19:51.346
come back. Pour a cup
of coffee.

19:51.546 --> 19:50.829
we'll talk about it.

19:52.022 --> 19:54.890
We'll become friends.
Friends.

19:55.090 --> 19:58.022
Think about it. I'll be right back.

19:58.222 --> 20:01.412
Get me the hell out of here.

20:01.412 --> 20:05.025
I'm stuck in this cold,
nowhere-place,

20:05.025 --> 20:08.070
nowhere to go.
No Cigarettes!

20:08.070 --> 20:14.501
What am I supposed to do?
Entertain this asshole?

20:15.830 --> 20:20.356
Oh. Okay. Great!
Good friends. Beautiful.

20:20.356 --> 20:23.451
Okay. Ah. I'll talk to the guy.
I'll play your game.

20:23.651 --> 20:25.683
I'll get the wood.
I'll talk to him. What?

20:25.683 --> 20:30.790
Wood. Wood.
Wood.

20:36.454 --> 20:38.159
You got an axe or something?

20:39.249 --> 20:45.529
Caribbean. The Bahamas.
A pretty girl.

20:45.529 --> 20:48.163
A body. A bikini.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.310
Do I get a pretty woman in
my illusion? No!

20:50.310 --> 20:54.845
No. I get  dick!
This sucks man!

21:03.564 --> 21:06.912
I guess he didn't want to talk.

21:11.222 --> 21:14.702
Ooooooh Shit!

21:14.902 --> 21:16.705
Hey boys.
This ain't funny anymore.

21:16.705 --> 21:18.342
Get me the hell outta here.

21:18.542 --> 21:21.773
Hey. Good boy. Stay!
Stay.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.065
AaaaaaH!

21:43.065 --> 21:47.458
Dammit. We're too late.
Give me the silver bullets.

21:56.673 --> 22:01.267
Leave it. Distract it.

23:10.629 --> 23:13.579
Ohh. This has gotta hurt?

23:27.232 --> 23:30.060
God forgive me.

24:20.376 --> 24:24.032
Well, what are you supposed
to be doing, handsome?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.647
Let's just take a little look.

24:38.081 --> 24:42.821
Welcome my dear. We thought
you were too tired to join us.

24:43.021 --> 24:46.111
So we started without you.
My apologies.

24:46.111 --> 24:49.370
You honor us with your presence.

24:49.308 --> 24:58.069
Join us.

24:54.613 --> 24:57.358
Come to me.

25:25.119 --> 25:28.069
You've met my sone stephan.

25:31.311 --> 25:33.858
Please be seated.

25:40.252 --> 25:42.851
This is Caringa...

25:43.051 --> 25:44.912
Layda...

25:46.816 --> 25:49.253
Gabriella...

25:48.853 --> 25:52.073
...and Emma.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.636
I'm so sorry your fiance
couldn't join us.

26:01.636 --> 26:04.050
He had to leave very abruptly.

26:04.050 --> 26:07.548
but he asked me to watch over
you at least until tomorrow.

26:09.059 --> 26:13.487
I hope you'll find our
company satidfactory?

26:23.013 --> 26:25.462
Raw meat.

26:25.662 --> 26:29.352
You do like raw meat?

26:29.552 --> 26:32.711
Please.
If not, we can have...

26:32.711 --> 26:38.264
No. That's fine. I haven't had
steak tartare in a long time.

26:38.464 --> 26:45.449
Steak tartare...? Oh yes.
Steak tartare.

26:49.052 --> 26:51.255
Oh, no.

26:51.455 --> 26:55.771
No sauce? But the sauce
makes the dish.

26:55.971 --> 26:59.470
Oh well. Our guest doesn't
like the sauce.

26:59.670 --> 27:03.847
No, that's Okay. Um, if you
recommend it. I'll try it.

27:14.848 --> 27:18.355
It's a little salty.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.157
But that's all part if its charm

28:50.532 --> 28:54.085
I must bid you goodnight.

28:57.988 --> 29:00.565
Louvick will show you
to your room.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.120
Wow. What an intense dream.

30:11.413 --> 30:14.889
Great dress.

30:19.162 --> 30:22.522
Doesn't a gentleman knock?

30:22.722 --> 30:27.578
If my father knew that
I was here...

30:28.633 --> 30:31.809
...he would banish me from the castle.

30:36.406 --> 30:39.058
He wants you for himself.

30:43.564 --> 30:46.050
Hey. Not so fast.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.464
Bitch!

31:12.467 --> 31:17.134
Darling. Is that you?
Its me. Charles.

31:17.134 --> 31:18.062
Charles?

31:18.062 --> 31:22.460
Yes. Charles.
Your fiance.

31:22.660 --> 31:25.377
Fiance?

31:25.377 --> 31:27.302
Don't turn it on.

31:27.502 --> 31:30.483
I don't want you to
see me like this.

31:34.221 --> 31:36.580
Oh, **** darling.

31:37.769 --> 31:40.217
It's all a game.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.539
It's a wax trick.

31:44.544 --> 31:46.272
It's a game.

31:48.148 --> 31:50.716
It isn't real.

31:53.065 --> 31:58.934
All just a sick stupid game.
Yes!

31:58.934 --> 32:01.742
Game?
I wish it were so.

32:01.742 --> 32:08.715
AAAAaaaH!
Get it off! AaaaaaH!

32:11.228 --> 32:12.999
Thank You.

32:13.199 --> 32:18.644
Now listen to me, carefully.
The Count is a vampire.

32:18.844 --> 32:21.539
They all are.
You have to destroy them.

32:22.621 --> 32:24.663
No, it's too late for that now.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.358
No. They're real.
They could only be killed

32:29.358 --> 32:34.120
by a crucifix, wood through
the heart or decapitation.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.427
You're crazy.

32:40.426 --> 32:44.958
So, my pretty. You came down
for a little midnight snack?

32:47.143 --> 32:49.823
Don't look at his eyes.

32:50.023 --> 32:51.901
I too feel pickish.

32:52.101 --> 32:56.376
First, the hors d'oeuvre.

33:12.936 --> 33:15.069
Now.

34:10.117 --> 33:15.159
The entree.

34:09.993 --> 34:12.741
Touch his head.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.386
Touch his head!

34:36.244 --> 34:37.447
Now find the cup.

34:37.447 --> 34:39.625
Look over there!
Break the chair!

34:39.824 --> 34:41.449
You use the leg as a stake.

34:41.449 --> 34:44.500
Break it.
BREAK IT!

35:50.308 --> 35:52.953
Going somewhere, my beauty?

36:43.605 --> 36:49.835
China? Tony? Sarah?
Where are you guys?

37:16.431 --> 37:21.937
Marquis de Sade said that sex without fear
and pain is like food without taste.

37:21.937 --> 37:24.027
We've been doing our homework.

37:24.027 --> 37:26.918
I've always wondered why someone
would believe in something like that.

37:26.918 --> 37:30.823
Guilt. Society. Good and evil.
I really don't know.

37:31.023 --> 37:34.331
I'm gonna go look for the other two.
Okay?

37:34.331 --> 37:36.960
Okay?

37:56.906 --> 37:58.964
Where the hell are they?

37:59.481 --> 38:00.407
Somewhere around?

38:00.407 --> 38:03.079
They're not anywhere. I looked
everywhere. I checked.

38:03.279 --> 38:05.396
I want out of here Sarah.
I'm serious.

38:05.396 --> 38:07.916
Getting scared?

38:07.916 --> 38:10.138
Don't worry. They've probably
just gone home.

38:10.338 --> 38:12.451
What? Tony and China?
Together?

38:12.651 --> 38:15.126
Oh. Jealousy wearing its ugly head.

38:16.035 --> 38:19.893
I'm not kidding. I want to get
out of here now. Okay?

38:29.240 --> 38:31.046
I've hoped you have enjoyed your visit.

38:31.246 --> 38:33.842
Ah. Yes. Thank you, it was
quite enjoyable.

38:33.842 --> 38:35.913
Your two friends left earlier.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.457
Uh huh.

38:37.657 --> 38:41.311
They seemed, loving by much.

38:41.511 --> 38:43.036
Tony and China?

38:44.972 --> 38:46.937
Well!
Goodnight!

38:47.137 --> 38:49.731
What is it with this girl?
One day it's me, the next day

38:49.731 --> 38:52.166
it's Charles Atlas., and now
Tony. What does she want?

38:52.366 --> 38:53.499
Then why do you still like her?

38:53.499 --> 38:54.780
Like her. I don't know
if I ever liked her.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.645
It's just you want what
you can't get

38:57.500 --> 38:59.375
I know what you mean.

39:14.466 --> 39:14.909
- Hello?

39:15.218 --> 39:16.099
Hello, Mrs. Webster?

39:16.099 --> 39:16.753
Uh huh.

39:16.753 --> 39:17.393
Is China there?

39:17.593 --> 39:18.340
No. Johnathan.

39:18.340 --> 39:19.397
No?

39:19.397 --> 39:20.705
She went to a waxwork party.

39:20.705 --> 39:22.224
A party at theh waxwork, huh?

39:23.794 --> 39:24.879
Can I give her a message?

39:26.196 --> 39:27.649
You don't happen to have the
address, do ya?

39:32.029 --> 39:34.551
Guys. China. where are you?

39:41.810 --> 39:43.916
Ah shit.

39:44.330 --> 39:45.692
My god.

39:58.770 --> 40:01.690
Good evening.
I own this waxworks.

40:01.890 --> 40:05.365
Look. I'm sorry. You know I.
I, I didn't meant to...

40:05.806 --> 40:08.493
I was just following a friend here
for some laughs, you know.

40:09.329 --> 40:10.612
I'll be leaving.

40:10.612 --> 40:13.682
Well that's alright. What's the point
of having all these beautiful works

40:13.682 --> 40:17.327
of art if you can't appreciate them?
This for instance.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.558
In't the figure wonderful?

40:19.558 --> 40:21.407
Is it the actual mask?

40:21.407 --> 40:23.128
As worn by the phantom.

40:23.128 --> 40:25.438
In the movie the "Curse of the Opera".

40:25.994 --> 40:28.315
They made a movie about
the Phantom of the Opera?

40:29.284 --> 40:30.644
Would you like a close look?

40:30.844 --> 40:31.724
Really?

40:31.924 --> 40:34.222
Step in please.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.000
They'll make a movie about
anything nowadays.

40:50.712 --> 40:52.863
I would invite you in, but it's late

40:53.405 --> 40:55.902
That's okay.

41:04.168 --> 41:06.330
No Mark.

41:08.254 --> 41:09.404
Why not?

41:09.604 --> 41:11.006
I don't know.

41:12.955 --> 41:15.389
I really like you and think
you're very attractive.

41:15.389 --> 41:16.845
Come on.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.908
No. I am serious.

41:19.108 --> 41:24.007
It's... it's just. I don't know. I...

41:25.036 --> 41:27.540
I'm looking for something else.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.471
Hey.

41:39.816 --> 41:42.914
It's okay. It's alright.

41:43.063 --> 41:45.302
Now go get some sleep.

41:45.784 --> 41:48.443
Come on. Scram. Get out of here.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.407
Thank You.

42:18.366 --> 42:29.329
(Jabbering in Spanish)

42:30.876 --> 42:33.415
Shhhh. Be very Quiet.

42:37.907 --> 42:39.060
Are you finished?

42:39.260 --> 42:43.540
Yes. But you know,
my English is not so good.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.315
No, no. It's okay.

42:45.709 --> 42:49.605
Great. Footnotes and everything.
You are an angel.

42:54.784 --> 43:00.400
The trouble with dictators. I think
the dictators are the bad people

43:00.400 --> 43:04.701
they have the shouting voices
and the small mustaches?

43:11.930 --> 43:15.556
Okay. I'm sorry. I... I'm just a
little upset. Okay?

43:16.114 --> 43:19.198
Could you tell her that Mark called, please?
Okay, thank you.

43:25.415 --> 43:27.701
Hi Steve. Here, it's Mark.
Is Tony there?

43:28.420 --> 43:33.012
He's not. Could you tell
him that I called please?

43:33.012 --> 43:34.323
Thank You.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.720
...and I spoke to Steve, and he
didn't know where Tony was.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.534
So then I went by the waxwork this
morning.

43:40.612 --> 43:44.160
No one was there. I mean, maybe
they've been kidnapped guys. Really.

43:44.160 --> 43:45.839
Or even worse.
Boiling wax.

43:46.039 --> 43:48.044
Mark. Maybe she had
another party to go to.

43:48.044 --> 43:50.090
More like a motel to go to.
You know China.

43:50.290 --> 43:52.604
No, no James.
It's not like that.

43:52.804 --> 43:54.406
Tony and China. They're just friends.

43:54.406 --> 43:55.816
That's not what you said last night.

43:55.816 --> 43:58.599
Okay, so maybe I was a
little over emotional.

43:58.799 --> 43:59.800
A little?

43:59.800 --> 44:02.891
Sarah. I really don't care
who China is screwing anymore.

44:02.891 --> 44:05.692
I really don't.
But I am positive that it's not Tony.

44:06.142 --> 44:06.993
So where are they?

44:07.193 --> 44:09.065
I still vote for the motel.

44:10.182 --> 44:11.927
I'm going to give them till this afternoon,

44:12.127 --> 44:14.374
and if we don't find them. I am
going to the police. I swear.

44:14.931 --> 44:16.919
You know how many people
have gone missing in this area

44:16.919 --> 44:18.159
in the last two weeks?

44:19.153 --> 44:20.564
No.

44:24.946 --> 44:27.036
That's a hell of a lot of people
in two weeks.

44:27.236 --> 44:28.606
And now another two.

44:28.606 --> 44:33.182
and you're telling me they've
been kidnapped, and boiled in wax.

44:35.102 --> 44:39.013
All I know, is that there is something
going on in that waxworks.

44:39.013 --> 44:40.371
Come on kid.

44:40.371 --> 44:42.640
You can give me a better story than that.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.178
I told you everything that I know. Yes!

44:47.688 --> 44:51.860
Okay, but if this some kind of sick joke
I'll have your balls in the slammer

44:51.860 --> 44:53.597
so fast, you won't have
time to squeal.

44:53.597 --> 44:55.063
Do you understand me?

44:56.820 --> 44:57.650
Good.

45:20.599 --> 45:23.076
Watch this. This weird little tiny
guy who is addicted to

45:23.076 --> 45:24.651
helium is going to open the door.

45:31.310 --> 45:32.692
Weird and tiny, huh?

45:32.692 --> 45:35.419
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:35.419 --> 45:38.434
I'm inspector Roberts. I'd appreciate
a look around your waxwork,

45:38.434 --> 45:39.748
if that would be convenient.

45:39.948 --> 45:42.974
Yes, of course. Why?

45:42.974 --> 45:46.037
This young man claims that he had
some friends visited last

45:46.037 --> 45:49.094
and uh. Well, they disappeared.

45:50.019 --> 45:53.403
Ah haha. Well come on in. Please.

46:02.584 --> 46:05.370
You know inspector, we're not
open yet, so I doubt if they

46:05.370 --> 46:07.159
visited this waxwork.

46:07.443 --> 46:09.224
You gonna swallow that shit?

46:09.224 --> 46:11.819
You, shut up.

46:12.743 --> 46:14.733
I'm sorry. You were saying?

46:15.528 --> 46:19.376
Yes, well. It's just that it couldn't
possibly be this waxwork,

46:19.376 --> 46:22.040
unless they broke in after dark.

46:23.536 --> 46:27.193
What? Oh, come on!
I don't believe this.

46:28.042 --> 46:31.277
Of course you can feel free to
wonder around if you wish.

46:31.277 --> 46:33.266
It would be a pleasure.

46:37.138 --> 46:38.504
You, stay here.

46:38.504 --> 46:39.546
I wanna show you a waxwork

46:39.546 --> 46:41.418
Sit!

47:05.998 --> 47:08.114
Oh, this is wonderful.

47:08.314 --> 47:11.207
You know, I have always been
fascinated with Egyptian history.

47:11.407 --> 47:13.565
Yes. It has always been
one of my favorites too.

47:14.558 --> 47:16.537
Would you like a closer look?

47:16.537 --> 47:19.001
It's all rather morbid though,
isn't it?

47:19.001 --> 47:22.725
Well, it does seem to be
what the people want.

47:22.725 --> 47:24.529
Yes. I guess you're right.

47:24.529 --> 47:26.684
Sure you wouldn't like a personal look?

47:27.949 --> 47:29.570
Really. I must be going.

47:32.875 --> 47:34.246
You're gonna fall for that?

47:34.246 --> 47:36.874
What else do you want me to do?
This isn't Russia, you know.

47:36.874 --> 47:38.783
Whar are ya going to do? Wait for
the next person to disappear,

47:38.783 --> 47:40.915
and then the next? Why don't
you do something?

47:41.115 --> 47:43.362
Listen kid. I know you are worried.
Why don't you just go home

47:43.362 --> 47:46.892
your friends probably left a message
for you there. Now relax.

47:52.254 --> 47:53.891
That's it.

47:54.313 --> 47:57.333
Never. Never underestimate the
political significance of

47:57.333 --> 47:59.736
mein kampf as literature...

48:00.210 --> 48:03.180
I'm sorry I am late sir.
I'm so sick I...

48:03.180 --> 48:06.802
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel nauseous. Uh, Sarah's

48:06.802 --> 48:09.954
gonna tell it's an incredibly contagious
disease. Excuse me, I gotta get through

48:09.954 --> 48:12.710
here. Sarah's got to... You got to
come with me to the hospital.

48:12.710 --> 48:16.888
to get x-rayed. Come here.
I got swollen glands

48:16.888 --> 48:20.393
and my tongue is coated.
Pustules. It's terrible sir.

48:20.393 --> 48:23.688
I think I'm going to puke. Things are
going to come as big as possible.

48:23.688 --> 48:26.661
I'm sorry sir. I'll bring her back
as soon as possible.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.659
Come on.

48:29.438 --> 48:31.782
You aren't sick! We could
get expelled for this!

48:31.782 --> 48:32.814
What the fug you doing?

48:32.814 --> 48:35.267
Listen. I think I know
what is going on. Okay?

48:35.267 --> 48:37.520
I went to the waxkork today
and met this man.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.462
Oh that explains everything.

48:39.662 --> 48:42.270
You don't understand. I recognized his face.

48:42.270 --> 48:43.912
Big deal.

48:59.285 --> 49:01.361
Are you sure you don't want
me for call for backup?

49:01.361 --> 49:03.393
First I want to see if I am
imagining things.

49:03.497 --> 49:05.491
'you alright?

49:05.491 --> 49:07.375
I'll let you know.

50:41.028 --> 50:43.140
Shit.

50:45.170 --> 50:48.489
If my mother caught me up
here, she'd kill me.

50:53.537 --> 50:54.664
Whose is all this?

50:54.664 --> 50:57.824
My grandfather's. Well,
most of it anyway.

50:57.824 --> 51:01.992
He was a very strange man. He
was fascinated by death and horror.

51:01.992 --> 51:07.388
My afamily never really aknowledges him,
apart from that portrait in the dining room.

52:14.911 --> 52:17.955
Sarah.
Come over here.

52:23.631 --> 52:25.612
Listen to this.

52:25.812 --> 52:29.804
Last night, Millionaire Michael Loftmore
was found murdered in his drawing room.

52:29.804 --> 52:33.078
His body was badly burnt, and he seemd
to have died in great pain.

52:33.078 --> 52:38.032
The only thing missing from the house
was the collection of 36 artifacts.

52:38.032 --> 52:39.700
all belonging to Loftmore.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.838
...and the it goes on.

52:42.038 --> 52:46.132
Now listen to this. The only clue is the
disappearance of Mr. David Lincoln,

52:46.132 --> 52:48.584
Loftmore's chief helper of the house.

52:48.584 --> 52:51.067
- Well?
- Well.

52:51.067 --> 52:53.791
"This Mr. Lincoln".

52:55.208 --> 52:57.044
And that's the man I saw at
the waxwork.

52:57.044 --> 53:00.428
That's the same man I
originally met, with China.

53:00.428 --> 53:02.844
But he hasn't aged.

53:03.797 --> 53:05.226
Mark, what's happening?

53:05.226 --> 53:07.236
I don't know.

53:07.236 --> 53:09.445
but I know where we can find out.

53:27.302 --> 53:31.733
Come on Nigel. Just don't stand there.
Give me a hand.

53:35.296 --> 53:37.290
Come on Nigel.

53:41.066 --> 53:43.468
Help the professor darling.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.216
This one is a heavy one.

53:56.164 --> 54:00.448
Come on Nigel. Give me a hand.
Push the darn thing.

54:31.771 --> 54:33.972
Rhaoul.

54:43.899 --> 54:47.654
The curse.
Those who desecrate the tomb of Rhaol

54:47.654 --> 54:51.610
will be condemmed to a painful death
by hands of...

55:00.722 --> 55:02.982
Heavens.
It's the mummy.

55:02.982 --> 55:04.437
Shit!

55:05.634 --> 55:07.556
Let's get the hell out of here.

55:08.491 --> 55:10.130
The door!

55:10.595 --> 55:12.607
Push up the door.

55:16.270 --> 55:18.042
There's a lever here someplace.

55:32.761 --> 55:34.373
Have you got gun or anything?

55:34.373 --> 55:37.610
Yes in my bag. Probably on the
side of the tomb.

56:10.594 --> 56:14.776
Don't just lie ther. Open the damn door!

57:11.783 --> 57:15.478
Hello Mark! Sit down dear fellow.
Sit down.

57:15.478 --> 57:18.148
I am.

57:22.423 --> 57:26.941
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brightman.
This is Sir Wilfred, my godfather.

57:26.941 --> 57:27.932
Hello.

57:27.932 --> 57:31.101
Call me Wilfey. Everyone else does.

57:31.101 --> 57:33.996
Now. How about a whiskey?

57:33.996 --> 57:35.204
Maybe something stronger?

57:35.204 --> 57:36.348
No thank your sir, we're fine.

57:36.348 --> 57:39.647
So. Now, what's so urgent?

57:39.847 --> 57:41.887
Well, it's a long story.

57:41.887 --> 57:43.771
Oh ** ***, love it.

57:43.771 --> 57:45.154
I think Sarah shoould start.

57:45.154 --> 57:46.793
Even better.

57:46.793 --> 57:49.946
Don't have to look at your ugly mug.
Now come on young lady. HaHah.

57:49.946 --> 57:51.315
Haven't got all day.

57:51.315 --> 57:54.253
Well, it all started when a friend and I...

57:54.253 --> 57:55.638
China.

57:55.838 --> 57:58.787
China and I were walking to class,
in the one neighborhood,

57:58.787 --> 58:01.935
and we ran into this man...

58:39.593 --> 58:42.487
What the hell did you kill him for?

58:42.487 --> 58:45.592
We still need two more.
He would've been perfect!

58:48.413 --> 58:53.940
That's alright. I'm sorry I shouted.
You got to learn your own strength.

58:53.940 --> 58:57.461
You're a big boy now.
Very big.

58:57.461 --> 59:02.051
Hans have better find some new visitors.
We're running out of time.

59:06.866 --> 59:09.260
Get rid of that. It's useless.

59:11.961 --> 59:17.232
Mark found the article in the attic,
and uh, about the murder and Mr. Lincoln.

59:17.232 --> 59:22.273
And, so that's why he thought
we should come and see you.

59:25.016 --> 59:27.598
This is very serious. You see your
grandfather, bless him,

59:27.598 --> 59:33.217
who collected over the years, 18
trinkets. Belong to 18 of the most

59:33.217 --> 59:34.558
evil men that have ever been.

59:34.558 --> 59:35.516
Well?

59:35.516 --> 59:37.331
Divide 18 into 3.

59:37.331 --> 59:39.596
6, 6 and 6

59:39.596 --> 59:42.126
Yes. The number of the Devil.

59:42.126 --> 59:45.573
Your grandfather and I were
fascinated by all that horror stuff.

59:45.573 --> 59:48.683
We talked about it. we played
a little. Never took it too seriously.

59:48.683 --> 59:51.017
Mr. Lincoln, obviously does.

59:51.017 --> 59:52.704
Who is this Mr. Lincoln?

59:52.704 --> 59:56.074
Well, he had his own waxwork show
in San Francisco, but it failed

59:56.074 --> 59:57.987
before he started working
with your grandfather.

59:57.987 --> 01:00:02.659
He murders my grandfather 40 years ago,
and yet he still doesn't look a day over 50.

01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:07.136
If you sold your soud to the Devil,
you'd never age either.

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.518
Sell my soul?

01:00:08.518 --> 01:00:11.982
Any student of black magic can do it.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:17.056
Most of these books will tell you how.

01:00:17.824 --> 01:00:19.760
So what happens when you have sold out?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.270
You've got yourself a regular job,

01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:24.887
as Satan's disciple.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:27.115
Doing what?
- Tipping the scales.

01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:31.175
Ruining that delicate balance
between good and evil.

01:00:31.681 --> 01:00:36.022
I think that our list to Lincoln has
found a very effective way of doing it.

01:00:36.022 --> 01:00:41.119
As a fool to belief, if by making a wax
effigy of an evil being

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:44.441
containing a belonging of his that
he possessed in earthly form

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:47.941
and feeding him the soul of a
believing victim,

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.702
you can bring him back to life.

01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:54.454
But what you have discovered is
even more terrifying.

01:00:54.454 --> 01:00:58.456
You see, your grandfather not
only collected their belongings,

01:00:58.456 --> 01:01:01.415
but also a small piece from
the dwelling of ***.

01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:06.187
What Lincoln has done, is to recreate
a whole scene from each character's life.

01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:10.980
which becomes like a small time vessel.
The wholw display is the ghost

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.607
not just the figures.
He does not need to kill anyone,

01:01:13.607 --> 01:01:18.293
sacrifice, or use spells. He just sits
back while the display does it for him,

01:01:18.293 --> 01:01:25.465
until the day when there were 18 victims.
A time when 18 of the most evil souls

01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:29.584
were ever been... sould live again.
Destroying the world,

01:01:29.584 --> 01:01:34.373
with the help of their possessed.
The voodoo and the world.

01:01:34.373 --> 01:01:38.233
And the dead shall rise
and consume all things.

01:01:38.233 --> 01:01:39.376
Can tis be stopped?

01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:42.667
Maybe before the event.
Never after.

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:43.858
WHat can we do?

01:01:43.858 --> 01:01:47.277
Must burn the waxworks,
but most important.

01:01:47.277 --> 01:01:51.727
The ones that have not yet claimed lives,
that way,

01:01:51.727 --> 01:01:54.381
the chain can never be finished.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:55.667
Now, you must hurry.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:57.894
I wish I could help, but I could only
be a hindrance.

01:01:57.894 --> 01:01:58.449
but

01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:00.587
You must go now.

01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:03.550
Come on Sarah.

01:02:05.465 --> 01:02:08.745
Thank you Sir Wilfred.
- Good luck.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.613
Tell the others our Mr. Lincoln
has been found.

01:02:20.455 --> 01:02:22.280
It has begun.

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:42.723
Why can't we just burn it
down from the outside?

01:02:42.723 --> 01:02:46.503
Right. They douse the flames, and
we get arrested for arson.

01:02:46.503 --> 01:02:51.521
That would be nice. Now, we've got
to burn down each displayed ourselves.

01:02:58.136 --> 01:02:59.456
Let's find our way around back.

01:03:13.099 --> 01:03:16.913
I can't see a damn thing.
Give me my lighter.

01:03:19.947 --> 01:03:22.337
Don't worry, it's only wax.

01:03:23.361 --> 01:03:25.803
There's a light switch.

01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:10.849
Sarah. What are doing?

01:04:11.049 --> 01:04:13.538
Come on. We have to burn the
victims and the displays.

01:04:13.538 --> 01:04:15.842
Move it!

01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:19.548
Come on girl. Move it.

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.233
Sarah. Come on!

01:04:29.124 --> 01:04:30.965
Bravo!

01:04:31.987 --> 01:04:34.428
To the divine lunch monkey.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:43.259
Well. Do we go riding or have you
something slightly more vigorous

01:04:43.259 --> 01:04:45.067
for this afternon's entertainment?

01:04:45.067 --> 01:04:48.861
I don't know about you, your majesty,
but I do get so bored with whipping...

01:04:48.861 --> 01:04:51.299
...horses.

01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:11.721
How would you like to ride this little
filly until she drops?

01:05:11.721 --> 01:05:13.507
What a wonderful idea.

01:05:14.363 --> 01:05:17.169
What fine lines.

01:05:22.237 --> 01:05:24.815
So fit.

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:30.299
So Unbroken.

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:38.452
Some day you must show me
the rest of your stable.

01:05:38.452 --> 01:05:44.505
Shall we how long it will
take to break her?

01:05:45.736 --> 01:05:48.240
May I?

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.298
But of course.

01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:56.799
Please. Have a seat.

01:06:29.148 --> 01:06:32.576
What a beautiful sight. No?

01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:41.721
First, I'm going to warm you up.
With the prince's riding prop.

01:06:41.721 --> 01:06:47.198
And at which, I am going to hand you
to the prince and his consults

01:06:47.198 --> 01:06:54.660
to use you like the whore
you are. Then, my beauty,

01:06:54.660 --> 01:07:03.221
I shall beat you again.
Until you die.

01:08:39.002 --> 01:08:43.006
This isn't real.
None of this is real.

01:08:43.006 --> 01:08:46.868
I was forced here. If I don't believe
in you, the you don't exist.

01:08:47.594 --> 01:08:49.630
Shit, I hope I'm right.

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:54.593
Grab him!

01:09:03.854 --> 01:09:09.113
(Speaking French)

01:09:09.314 --> 01:09:11.935
I'm sorry. I've never been
very good at languages.

01:09:22.937 --> 01:09:27.497
I've never seen a girl take so much.

01:09:27.698 --> 01:09:31.138
She's even a bigger whore than
her face betrays.

01:09:31.138 --> 01:09:34.517
They why you stop Marquis?
Beat here more.

01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:39.636
Your highness. If I beat her more,
she may not survive,

01:09:39.636 --> 01:09:43.395
and then you won't have a chance

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:48.661
to feel this white virgin flesh.

01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:51.301
Then we shall pleasure another of
your sluts.

01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:54.054
I want to see this whore
die at the whip now.

01:09:54.552 --> 01:09:58.048
Yes your highness' wishes.

01:10:03.126 --> 01:10:09.800
Well, my pretty rose. You die.

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:21.572
Lucky bitch!

01:10:21.572 --> 01:10:23.763
That's because she's a virgin and
gets to get beaten in

01:10:23.763 --> 01:10:26.070
front of the English prince.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.102
I mean that, we were all virgins once.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.886
Don't stop.
Don't stop.

01:11:29.913 --> 01:11:32.164
Don't let him take me.

01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:43.649
I seems she prefers our
company, young man.

01:11:43.649 --> 01:11:48.817
I must say, your girlfriend gave us
quite an entertaining show.

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:53.100
What a SLUT she is.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:57.633
Until the girl dies, you don't really exist.
You're just trapped in your little world.

01:11:57.633 --> 01:11:59.374
Your words mean nothing.

01:11:59.374 --> 01:12:01.765
Oh. Don't be angry

01:12:01.765 --> 01:12:07.449
just because she had her first
orgasm at the end of a whip,

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:10.603
and not by your touch.

01:12:10.603 --> 01:12:13.575
- Sarah, listen to me.
- Go away.

01:12:13.575 --> 01:12:18.507
Remember Tony? China? These people
butchered your friends.

01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:21.202
Don't you understand?
You're being possessed.

01:12:21.202 --> 01:12:24.016
It all started when you
looked into the display.

01:12:24.016 --> 01:12:27.356
These people may have killed your friends,
but they can't harm you.

01:12:27.356 --> 01:12:30.252
Not unless your mind allows them to.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.826
Watch.

01:12:37.258 --> 01:12:40.918
Your friend has quite an imagination.

01:12:40.918 --> 01:12:44.288
Come on.
Shoot me!

01:12:44.288 --> 01:12:46.155
Hit me!

01:12:46.155 --> 01:12:48.239
Or are you scared?

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:51.188
Afraid to look like a cowrad.
Afraid that you might see that the

01:12:51.188 --> 01:12:55.937
Marquis de Sade can only beat little girls,
and can't fight like a real man.

01:12:57.637 --> 01:12:59.997
See Sarah?

01:13:53.243 --> 01:14:03.662
Don't look so slug boy.
We shall be meeting again.

01:14:40.688 --> 01:14:48.239
This is the barrier. If you don't believe
in all of this, then the barrier...

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:51.327
...it can't stop you.
Watch.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.374
See?

01:14:57.874 --> 01:15:00.799
Are you ready?

01:15:01.533 --> 01:15:03.516
ARE YOU READY?

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:24.120
Well it looks like your little plan failed.

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:27.797
Just a little precaution.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.174
Are you sure they are going to be here?

01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:32.782
Honey, I know as much as you.
Some guy with a squeaky voice

01:15:32.782 --> 01:15:34.904
called and said meet them here at midnight.

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:41.360
They are good, aren't they?

01:15:44.337 --> 01:15:46.702
I suppose so.

01:15:54.762 --> 01:15:57.466
Wow, the glasses from
"Nutty Zombies from Hell".

01:15:57.466 --> 01:15:59.818
I gotta have those for my collection.

01:15:59.818 --> 01:16:01.256
Hey Ge...

01:16:07.247 --> 01:16:09.572
No one's going to miss them.

01:16:14.794 --> 01:16:18.086
-They was late.
- Shut up and watch.

01:16:27.877 --> 01:16:29.844
It's done.

01:16:34.317 --> 01:16:36.831
Live my children

01:16:37.172 --> 01:16:39.747
Live.

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:47.909
Run...
...Run!

01:17:47.909 --> 01:17:50.377
There's nowhere to run.

01:18:04.698 --> 01:18:06.977
What the...

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:13.200
He's right you know.
There is nowhere to run.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.960
Even one of hese gets out, the world
be contaminated within a few days.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.926
Our only chance is to contain them here.

01:18:20.926 --> 01:18:23.921
Before this whole rotting place
is brought to the ground.

01:18:23.921 --> 01:18:25.545
Enough with it, if we have to.

01:18:25.545 --> 01:18:27.415
Role here. I am ready. Sir.

01:18:27.415 --> 01:18:28.549
Jenkins!

01:18:28.549 --> 01:18:29.620
Good evening sir.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.205
Very good.

01:18:31.205 --> 01:18:35.051
Now these belonged to your grandfather.

01:18:35.051 --> 01:18:38.032
Use them wisely.

01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:45.360
Let's make sure that these wise asses
are dead before we burn them.

01:20:13.064 --> 01:20:16.859
James. It's me. Sarah.
james, it's me.

01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:19.364
Sorry.

01:20:35.157 --> 01:20:36.987
It's okay.

01:20:41.464 --> 01:20:45.810
- China. What happened?
- Shhh. It's okay.

01:20:46.767 --> 01:20:49.373
I missed you so much.

01:20:56.758 --> 01:20:58.214
It's altright sir.

01:20:58.746 --> 01:21:01.279
She, um. Wasn't human you know.

01:21:01.279 --> 01:21:06.629
She's been dead a long tome.
Come on. We've got battles to win.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.278
Come on sir.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.802
- Kiss me Sarah.
- Kiss this!

01:21:27.677 --> 01:21:29.182
Mark?

01:21:29.182 --> 01:21:33.595
You've always wanted me.
Here's your chance baby.

01:21:33.652 --> 01:21:36.504
You afraid of me?
TAKE ME!

01:21:36.504 --> 01:21:38.546
Take this.

01:21:41.546 --> 01:21:44.920
Jenkins! Behind you!

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.942
Jenkins. Get you some help?

01:21:58.942 --> 01:22:04.405
Too late for that sir.
Give my love to the Mrs.

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:08.236
Get those bastards.

01:22:31.262 --> 01:22:34.065
Get off.
Get off me.

01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:40.796
Quick! He's changing!

01:22:43.026 --> 01:22:45.597
Make my day.

01:22:52.544 --> 01:22:55.328
You! You little bastard!

01:23:41.735 --> 01:23:43.707
Damn.

01:23:49.908 --> 01:23:51.764
Fire!

01:23:51.364 --> 01:23:54.375
Fire.

01:24:31.906 --> 01:24:37.696
Now we shall see.
Who is the real man?

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.986
Kill the whimp.

01:25:58.598 --> 01:26:05.372
School time is over.
Now, you die.

01:26:23.643 --> 01:26:25.931
Sarah.

01:26:30.496 --> 01:26:32.888
How romantic.

01:26:35.477 --> 01:26:37.873
One last thing before you kill us Lincoln.

01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:38.873
You know my name.

01:26:39.073 --> 01:26:41.764
I should. You murdered my grandfather.

01:26:41.764 --> 01:26:46.466
You're a Loftmore.
Old ** lord's grandchild.

01:26:46.466 --> 01:26:50.278
Well well well what a coincidence.
It's such a small world.

01:26:50.278 --> 01:26:51.759
Well then why do you want to end it?

01:26:51.759 --> 01:26:54.127
Somebody has to.

01:26:55.096 --> 01:26:56.602
See you in hell.

01:27:21.148 --> 01:27:23.943
Thanks!
You okay Sarah?

01:27:25.983 --> 01:27:28.717
Would you like a closer look?

01:27:33.924 --> 01:27:35.249
Watch out. The flames

01:27:35.449 --> 01:27:37.519
Go away. I don't *** ** ***.

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:39.164
Save yourselves.

01:27:44.944 --> 01:27:46.715
Oh my goodness.

01:28:05.466 --> 01:28:08.083
It's our only chance.

01:32:54.551 --> 01:33:03.216
