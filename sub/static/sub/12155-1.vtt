00:01.006 --> 00:03.022
I told you months ago
that if you're gonna make this work

00:03.056 --> 00:05.348
you had to stop drinking
and smoking pot.

00:07.048 --> 00:10.358
I'll quit the pot
and the white wine!

00:10.392 --> 00:12.195
Are you working on a new book?

00:12.229 --> 00:14.030
Yes, it's coming along
really well.

00:14.065 --> 00:16.733
- ( Phone rings ) - I saw
your ad on Craigslist.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.666
- I need a private detective.
- I believe I can help you.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.298
You can't mess with other
people's lives like that.

00:21.332 --> 00:22.832
I know what to do.

00:22.866 --> 00:25.166
- I'm being blackmailed.
- I need you to find a woman.

00:25.201 --> 00:27.234
<i>Jonathan: So you'd like
me to follow him...</i>

00:27.269 --> 00:29.002
<i>- a tail job.
- A tail job, yeah.</i>

00:29.036 --> 00:32.704
- You really think you can get
David's skateboard back? - Yes.

00:32.738 --> 00:35.538
You call this monogamy?
I call it celibacy.

00:35.573 --> 00:38.306
Leah's gonna break up with me any minute now.
We haven't had sex in weeks.

00:38.341 --> 00:40.008
- I want to come with you.
- On my case?

00:40.042 --> 00:42.143
- Yes.
- This is George, my boss.

00:42.177 --> 00:44.242
- Do you mind if I smoke pot in here?
- Can I have some?

00:44.277 --> 00:47.044
This is all very insane
and illegal, isn't it?

00:47.079 --> 00:50.212
- ( Screams )
- ( Both yell )

00:50.247 --> 00:52.048
It is illegal and insane.

00:52.082 --> 00:54.281
<i>- ( Sirens blare )
- This is not good.</i>

00:54.316 --> 00:57.250
The lesbians I've been donating my sperm to?
They've disappeared.

00:57.284 --> 00:59.018
You telling me I'm pregnant
with this guy's baby?

00:59.052 --> 01:02.089
- Both: You're pregnant?
- We should definitely smoke again sometime.

01:02.123 --> 01:05.325
There's Antrem and Priscilla.
Richard used to work for me.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.892
And that's my best ex-wife.

01:07.927 --> 01:10.090
I challenge you
to a boxing match!

01:10.124 --> 01:11.658
- I'll fight Louis.
- I accept.

01:11.692 --> 01:13.860
What about me?
I wanna fight.

01:14.928 --> 01:16.595
Your first novel
was amateurish.

01:16.629 --> 01:19.330
"The New York Times"
said my prose was lucid!

01:20.198 --> 01:21.332
<i>Come on, George!</i>

01:24.469 --> 01:26.269
You think we learned
anything tonight?

01:26.303 --> 01:28.104
No.

01:28.138 --> 01:29.905
But that's okay.

01:29.939 --> 01:32.540
It's good to stay
in the dark about things.

01:32.574 --> 01:34.508
It keeps life interesting.

03:09.879 --> 03:12.846
<i>Jonathan: Okay, so here are
my three rules of writing:</i>

03:12.881 --> 03:15.115
One, it's difficult;

03:15.149 --> 03:18.551
two, there will always be more
rejection than acceptance;

03:18.585 --> 03:22.721
and three, try to give
pleasure with every sentence.

03:22.755 --> 03:26.290
But it's easy for you to say there will
always be more rejection than acceptance.

03:26.325 --> 03:28.359
You're a published writer.
You've already made it.

03:28.393 --> 03:30.360
Well, actually,

03:30.394 --> 03:32.095
my second novel
was just rejected.

03:32.129 --> 03:36.031
I have to pay back
my advance to my publisher.

03:37.266 --> 03:39.901
( Mutters )
It's pretty demoralizing.

03:39.935 --> 03:41.869
For what it's worth,
I read your first book.

03:41.904 --> 03:44.805
I'm not Jewish, but I liked it.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.373
Oh.
Well, thank you.

03:47.408 --> 03:49.575
And... well,
has anyone else read

03:49.610 --> 03:51.777
"I Pass Like Night,"
my first novel?

03:54.647 --> 03:57.948
Well, um, okay. Why don't
we go around the class?

03:57.982 --> 04:00.916
Each of you can briefly describe
what you plan to write about.

04:00.951 --> 04:03.518
So we'll start with you.
Hi.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.888
I want to write a book
like Zadie Smith,

04:06.923 --> 04:10.958
something that talks about how
hard and weird it is to be alive

04:10.992 --> 04:14.127
even if you're middle class and
your parents were pretty loving.

04:14.161 --> 04:18.863
It might also be about
bulimia and anorexia.

04:18.898 --> 04:21.399
- I'd read that book.
- Thank you.

04:22.735 --> 04:24.469
( Thick accent )
I want to write a novel

04:24.503 --> 04:27.205
about a man who's either
a bicycle courier

04:27.239 --> 04:28.606
or a spastic wizard.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.541
Or a spastic courier.
I haven't decided.

04:30.575 --> 04:33.310
Making the guy a spastic
wizard sounds better to me.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.211
- That's my two cents.
- Okay.

04:35.246 --> 04:37.513
That's what I'll do.
Thank you.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.882
- Great.
- If he's spastic,

04:39.916 --> 04:42.618
he can always be dropping his wand.
That's funny.

04:42.652 --> 04:46.088
Please don't tell me how to
write my story. Thank you.

04:46.122 --> 04:47.856
Wait. Wait!

04:52.161 --> 04:55.330
- ( Sighs )
- My turn?

04:58.199 --> 05:00.633
( Slurping )

05:00.668 --> 05:03.001
- Hey, Ray.
- Hi.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.904
- Good night, Professor Ames.
- Good night, Bob.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.210
- "Professor Ames"?
Is that guy nuts? - Maybe.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.779
All of my students are
in a lot of mental pain.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.148
- That's night classes for you.
- Night.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.451
Night, Nina.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.456
Jonathan, to your first class.

05:27.893 --> 05:30.395
Oh, come on.
Don't be so down in the mouth.

05:30.429 --> 05:35.656
- I think it's great that you're teaching.
- I just think it's sad

05:35.691 --> 05:37.819
didn't you tell 'em
nobody's reading anymore?

05:37.854 --> 05:41.055
Even I'm not reading.
I got a kindle, but I dropped it in the tub.

05:41.089 --> 05:44.092
<i>- ( Phone rings )
- That's Leah.</i>

05:44.126 --> 05:46.194
<i>- ( Beeps )
- She knows I'm at a bar.</i>

05:46.228 --> 05:48.495
She put my phone
on her G.P.S. tracking system.

05:48.529 --> 05:51.630
( Exasperated groan )

05:51.664 --> 05:53.631
( Mutters harshly )

05:53.665 --> 05:55.199
( Chuckles )
G.P.S.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.567
I don't know, George.
If I didn't need the money,

05:57.602 --> 05:59.436
I don't think I'd be
teaching this workshop.

05:59.471 --> 06:02.206
I am sorry about the money
situation, Jonathan.

06:02.241 --> 06:04.308
I don't know how much work
I can give you.

06:04.343 --> 06:06.777
The new publisher and the board
are showing up tomorrow.

06:06.811 --> 06:08.546
I may have to cut
even more pages.

06:08.580 --> 06:11.515
George, do you think
I'm washed up at 30?

06:11.549 --> 06:13.650
No. You're too young
to be washed up.

06:13.684 --> 06:15.885
You might still be growing.

06:15.919 --> 06:18.287
But I have no skills
for the world.

06:18.321 --> 06:21.156
At this rate I might have to
move back in with my parents.

06:21.191 --> 06:24.092
Listen, a little failure
is good for you.

06:24.127 --> 06:26.228
It'll give your face
some texture.

06:26.262 --> 06:29.464
Also, you and I'll be
on the same schedule.

06:29.499 --> 06:32.633
- What do you mean?
- You fail in your 30s, succeed in your 40s.

06:32.668 --> 06:35.469
Have a little bit of
a dark period in your 50s

06:35.503 --> 06:37.338
and then flourish again
in your 60s.

06:37.372 --> 06:40.374
But I don't want to fail
my whole 30s.

06:40.408 --> 06:43.677
Jonathan, it takes time
for a man to find his form.

06:43.711 --> 06:47.414
Leah. She doesn't want me
to drink too much.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.149
We have our first
yoga class tomorrow.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.519
<i>Oh. I've gotta leave soon anyways.
I've got to meet a client at midnight.</i>

06:53.553 --> 06:56.654
- I didn't know you liked yoga.
- I don't.

06:56.689 --> 06:59.490
Leah wants us to do
more things together.

06:59.524 --> 07:02.926
We're also taking
a sign language class.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.361
- ( Blows raspberry )
- Yoga sounds good.

07:05.395 --> 07:08.097
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll probably hurt myself.

07:08.131 --> 07:09.764
The only new age thing
I want to do

07:09.798 --> 07:12.832
is stick an aromatherapy
candle up my ass.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.902
Aren't those candles very wide?

07:16.937 --> 07:20.039
I was joking, George.
I don't want to do that.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.739
Oh.
Oh oh.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.774
I thought you
were being serious.

07:23.809 --> 07:25.842
Because I had
a girlfriend in the '70s

07:25.876 --> 07:29.011
who tried to stimulate me
once with a shabbat candle,

07:29.046 --> 07:32.548
you know, down there,
but I was too uptight.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.750
- My mom used to light shabbat candles...
- Jeez!

07:35.785 --> 07:37.218
What happened?
You all right?

07:37.253 --> 07:39.420
Oh, jeez, I just had
the most awful pain.

07:39.454 --> 07:41.188
In your chest?
Do you have an aspirin?

07:41.222 --> 07:43.656
It's important to take an
aspirin after a heart attack.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.726
I didn't have a heart attack.
It was in my penis.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.794
I mean, it was like
a phantom lightning bolt.

07:49.829 --> 07:52.030
I've never felt anything
like that before.

07:52.064 --> 07:55.099
Well, that's terrible.
That could be an aneurism in your penis.

07:55.134 --> 07:57.535
- No, don't say...
- You need to go see a urologist, George.

07:57.569 --> 07:59.570
<i>- Jeffrey.
- Yes, Mr. Christopher?</i>

07:59.604 --> 08:03.039
Another one, please.
It's an emergency.

08:03.073 --> 08:06.175
- Medical.
- Oh.

08:24.459 --> 08:27.091
<i>( Horses whickering )</i>

08:29.026 --> 08:34.028
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

08:34.063 --> 08:35.863
Jonathan Ames?

08:37.131 --> 08:38.065
Yes.

08:38.099 --> 08:39.732
It's good to meet you.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.168
Thank you so much for coming.

08:44.505 --> 08:47.839
- You wanna meet Doris?
- Sure.

08:47.873 --> 08:49.040
<i>( Gate opens )</i>

08:49.074 --> 08:51.108
Come on, girl.
Here she is.

08:51.142 --> 08:52.976
Hello, Doris.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.646
She's my favorite.

08:59.316 --> 09:01.317
So how can I help you,
officer Drake?

09:02.852 --> 09:04.953
I got a real situation.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.921
You ever destroy a hard drive?

09:07.955 --> 09:10.156
Yeah, I was playing
Internet backgammon

09:10.190 --> 09:12.224
and I got a really bad
virus on my laptop.

09:12.259 --> 09:14.292
No, I mean someone else's
hard drive...

09:14.327 --> 09:16.027
I need you to destroy it.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.261
Whose hard drive is it?

09:18.163 --> 09:19.663
It's embarrassing.

09:21.199 --> 09:23.166
You see, a couple years ago

09:23.201 --> 09:26.870
I started going to this
dungeon... you know, s&m.

09:26.904 --> 09:30.741
I need to clear my name
off of their computer.

09:30.775 --> 09:33.177
- Why do you need to clear your name?
- It turns out the damn place

09:33.212 --> 09:35.892
has been laundering drug money
and now it's gonna be raided.

09:35.926 --> 09:38.161
- I see. - My career as a
mounted police officer

09:38.195 --> 09:40.497
is at stake...
my marriage, everything.

09:40.531 --> 09:43.733
I coach my daughter's
soccer team in Maspeth.

09:43.767 --> 09:46.135
I can't be exposed
for who I am.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.939
I understand.
We all need our secrets.

09:48.974 --> 09:50.642
( Whickers )

09:50.676 --> 09:52.610
Thank you.

09:55.548 --> 09:57.782
I know I just said
we all need our secrets,

09:57.817 --> 10:01.319
but if you don't mind me asking, what
do you like to do at the dungeon?

10:01.353 --> 10:04.189
I'm sort of a student
of human sexuality.

10:04.223 --> 10:06.825
Well...

10:06.859 --> 10:09.161
You ever hear of
forced feminization?

10:09.195 --> 10:11.463
- Yes. - Yeah?
Well, that's what I got.

10:12.365 --> 10:13.565
When I was eight years old,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.868
my older sister and a
couple of her friends,

10:15.902 --> 10:17.869
they dressed me up
in a girl scout uniform...

10:17.904 --> 10:20.672
you know, the little skirt,
panties, lipstick...

10:20.707 --> 10:21.840
the whole nine yards.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.142
<i>They said that I was
a pretty little girl</i>

10:24.177 --> 10:27.578
and it... you know,
it did something to me.

10:27.613 --> 10:31.114
You know, I tried on my
mother's panties when I was 15

10:31.149 --> 10:33.916
and I liked it,
but it didn't stick.

10:33.951 --> 10:35.751
I just did it the one time.

10:35.785 --> 10:38.119
Well, you're lucky,
'cause with me, it stuck.

10:38.153 --> 10:39.986
I mean, I have to do it
once a month or so.

10:40.021 --> 10:42.155
- It's like I'm ovulating.
- Hmm.

10:42.189 --> 10:44.690
Don't get me wrong.
I love it, but...

10:44.724 --> 10:46.791
It also suffocates me.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.560
It presses down on me.

10:49.594 --> 10:52.229
That's kind of like what
Ahab said about Moby Dick...

10:52.263 --> 10:54.197
"he heaps me."

10:55.766 --> 10:57.499
Yeah, right.

10:59.669 --> 11:01.237
I don't mean to impose,

11:01.271 --> 11:03.238
but could I sit on Doris?

11:03.272 --> 11:05.606
I've actually never been on a horse.
I'm Jewish.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.007
Absolutely.
Come on.

11:08.610 --> 11:11.980
You know, you do this for me and
I'm gonna quit once and for all.

11:12.014 --> 11:13.749
You know, this whole thing,
it's like a sign.

11:13.783 --> 11:16.118
It's my chance to start over.

11:17.019 --> 11:18.986
Yeah.

11:20.155 --> 11:23.390
Tomorrow that hard drive
will be destroyed.

11:23.424 --> 11:25.558
<i>( Horses galloping )</i>

11:30.029 --> 11:32.830
( Moans ) Thank you.

11:33.798 --> 11:37.034
Oh, your nose rubs against me

11:37.068 --> 11:39.869
in this really great way.

11:39.904 --> 11:42.171
Ah, that's good.

11:44.641 --> 11:48.276
You know, Stella, you're
the best thing in my life.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.344
No, I'm not.

11:50.379 --> 11:53.146
You are. If I didn't have you,
I wouldn't have anything.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.147
You have a lot.

11:55.181 --> 11:58.716
You have...
well, you're teaching now.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.884
It's night school.

12:00.919 --> 12:04.287
You also help people
as a private detective.

12:04.321 --> 12:06.321
Unlicensed.

12:06.355 --> 12:07.555
You could get a license.

12:07.589 --> 12:09.290
No, I already looked into it.

12:09.324 --> 12:11.557
There is a lot
of paperwork involved.

12:11.591 --> 12:16.159
And you have to be a retired
policeman or soldier.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.960
I've never even worn a uniform.

12:17.994 --> 12:20.862
As a child, I was too nervous
to join the boy scouts.

12:20.897 --> 12:23.398
Oh.

12:24.701 --> 12:26.336
Okay.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.206
<i>I am the best thing
in your life.</i>

12:28.240 --> 12:30.174
- I told you.
- ( Both laugh )

12:37.916 --> 12:40.118
( Softly )
You're not even trying.

12:40.152 --> 12:42.220
( Softly )
I am. I'm meditating.

12:42.254 --> 12:44.488
You said meditation
is part of this.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.427
It comes at the end of class.

12:48.461 --> 12:50.492
I skipped to end.
I'm a fast learner.

13:01.032 --> 13:03.732
Hey.
Isn't Mecca that way?

13:05.869 --> 13:08.203
No, I get it, I get it.
We're cutting pages.

13:08.237 --> 13:12.073
But I know that I can still
put out a quality magazine.

13:12.107 --> 13:15.375
Well, it's gonna be more than
just cutting a few pages, George.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.510
Every belt
needs to be tightened.

13:17.545 --> 13:19.879
No more lunches
at the four seasons.

13:19.913 --> 13:21.647
What?
No no.

13:21.681 --> 13:23.915
I've had a table in the
grill room for 20 years.

13:23.950 --> 13:27.918
It's where I had lunch with
Saul bellow, with Jackie o.

13:27.952 --> 13:30.819
And no more things
like "oranjainah."

13:32.021 --> 13:33.955
This is the way I saved
"The Dallas Monthly"

13:33.989 --> 13:35.522
and "The Salt Lake City Weekly."

13:35.556 --> 13:37.990
Well, that's great.
Those are wonderful magazines,

13:38.025 --> 13:40.158
but I need to be able
to take people out to lunch.

13:40.193 --> 13:42.159
- Like who?
- Like important people...

13:42.194 --> 13:46.095
my frien... sources, important
sources and contacts,

13:46.130 --> 13:48.830
- so of whom are my
friends, yes... - George.

13:48.864 --> 13:52.066
You don't engage in that
kind of journalism anymore.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.534
There's a lovely commissary
on the third floor.

13:55.569 --> 13:58.436
- There is?
- Mm-hmm.

14:00.638 --> 14:02.672
Look, I know
it's a small thing,

14:02.706 --> 14:06.241
but I love orangina.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.042
So does the whole staff.

14:08.076 --> 14:11.277
See, I was at
the Sorbonne in 1969

14:11.312 --> 14:13.612
and I had a French
girlfriend, naturally.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.814
And every time
I have an orangina,

14:15.848 --> 14:18.916
I go back in time to the
boulevard Saint-Michel.

14:18.950 --> 14:20.683
George, stop it.

14:20.718 --> 14:24.252
The publishing world
has changed.

14:24.287 --> 14:25.519
No more orjianah.

14:25.553 --> 14:28.922
Now about the board meeting,
later today:

14:31.792 --> 14:34.294
Don't let that throw you.
Right. Listen,

14:34.328 --> 14:36.529
I don't mean to be rude,

14:36.564 --> 14:38.831
but are you on
the Christian right

14:38.866 --> 14:41.967
or are you just the hired fixer
for all the magazines they buy?

14:42.002 --> 14:43.769
I fix,

14:43.803 --> 14:45.837
but politically,
if you're interested,

14:45.872 --> 14:49.141
I'm not on the right,
but I am a libertarian.

14:49.175 --> 14:51.176
Sorry.

14:52.712 --> 14:55.413
You know, most people think of
me as an old-fashioned liberal,

14:55.448 --> 14:57.583
but I'm kind of a closet
libertarian myself.

14:57.617 --> 14:59.985
I'm fiscally responsible,

15:00.019 --> 15:01.886
but sexually out of control.

15:01.921 --> 15:03.888
( Chuckles )

15:05.457 --> 15:07.725
Okay.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.862
( Buzzes )

15:14.897 --> 15:16.130
( Dings )

15:18.667 --> 15:20.335
( Lock buzzes )

15:25.409 --> 15:27.511
So what do you like to do?

15:27.545 --> 15:29.079
Well, this is my first time,

15:29.113 --> 15:30.912
but I'm open-minded.

15:30.947 --> 15:33.014
Do you offer, like,
a prix fixe option...

15:33.048 --> 15:35.649
like a tasting menu where I
could try a couple things?

15:35.683 --> 15:37.951
Sure, we can start with
some basic beginner play.

15:37.985 --> 15:41.187
Once the session starts, you're
to call me mistress Florence.

15:41.221 --> 15:43.756
Really? Florence is
my mother's name.

15:43.790 --> 15:46.258
Oh. You're an infantilist.
I'll go get some diapers.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.594
No no, no diapers.
Just thought I'd mention it.

15:48.628 --> 15:50.095
You know?
Just a coincidence.

15:50.129 --> 15:51.630
There aren't
that many Florences.

15:51.664 --> 15:54.967
There's Florence Nightingale,
Florence the city in Italy...

15:55.001 --> 15:57.369
<i>which actually
is Firenze.</i>

15:57.404 --> 16:00.106
Stop talking.
I'm gonna go get changed.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.308
And when I come back,
I want you naked,

16:02.342 --> 16:05.077
lying face down
with your ass in the air.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.221
<i>( Whip cracking,
man whimpering )</i>

16:15.255 --> 16:17.223
<i>Woman:
Do not touch your penis!</i>

16:18.725 --> 16:20.859
( Door closes )

16:26.365 --> 16:28.567
<i>( Whip cracks,
man cries out )</i>

16:46.512 --> 16:49.315
( Softly ) Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

16:49.349 --> 16:51.352
Come on, come on.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.789
( Phone rings )

16:53.823 --> 16:56.258
Yes?

16:56.293 --> 16:58.026
She's, uh...
all tied up right now.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.465
( Beeps )

17:07.403 --> 17:09.771
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.

17:09.806 --> 17:12.574
Uh, just thought we could
role-play hide-and-seek

17:12.608 --> 17:14.809
like I did with my mom,
you know,

17:14.844 --> 17:17.011
my first mistress Florence.

17:18.512 --> 17:20.880
I'm the one who dictates
what goes on in our sessions,

17:20.914 --> 17:23.782
- you little castrato piece of shit!
- Ow ow ow!

17:23.817 --> 17:26.852
Shut up.
But I do respect limits.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.754
What's your
safety word gonna be?

17:28.789 --> 17:30.890
- "Help"?
- No, I prefer the word "eunuch."

17:30.924 --> 17:34.393
I think a one-syllable word like "help" might be better.
I can get it out quicker.

17:34.427 --> 17:35.960
- Shut up.
- Ow!

17:35.995 --> 17:38.596
Leah: I just don't feel like
you're interested in me.

17:38.631 --> 17:40.598
You never want to know
what I think about things.

17:40.632 --> 17:43.234
- That is not true, Leah.
- To me it's true.

17:43.268 --> 17:45.235
You don't care about
what I care about.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.704
I enjoyed the yoga class, okay?

17:47.738 --> 17:50.373
I'm looking forward
to the sign language thing.

17:50.407 --> 17:52.575
Look, I've been practicing.
Watch this.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.413
It means "you stink
after yoga class."

17:57.447 --> 18:01.016
It's not about
taking classes, Ray.

18:01.051 --> 18:03.618
You're the one that said we
should do things together.

18:03.653 --> 18:05.787
I did, but it's more than that.

18:05.821 --> 18:07.788
( Sighs )

18:07.822 --> 18:11.158
Look, I know that I don't really
know how to say the right things.

18:11.192 --> 18:13.627
( Stammers ) I just...

18:13.661 --> 18:15.395
I... Go ahead.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.764
I just think
I need to be alone.

18:17.798 --> 18:20.430
I went right from my marriage
to being with you.

18:20.464 --> 18:23.030
I haven't been on my own
since I was like 20.

18:23.064 --> 18:24.662
I don't know who I am.

18:24.696 --> 18:26.460
Are you...

18:26.494 --> 18:28.428
are you trying
to break up with me?

18:30.164 --> 18:32.332
Yes.

18:34.234 --> 18:36.168
- Why?
- I'm sorry, Ray.

18:36.203 --> 18:38.337
- I'm just not happy.
- But nobody's happy!

18:38.371 --> 18:40.172
My parents have been
together for 40 years!

18:40.206 --> 18:41.673
They haven't been happy
for a second!

18:41.708 --> 18:43.875
Ray, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go, okay?

18:43.910 --> 18:47.145
I just wanna be alone.
I'm gonna go.

18:47.179 --> 18:48.579
( Sniffles )

18:54.251 --> 18:56.352
<i>( Paddle thudding,
Jonathan grunting )</i>

18:58.188 --> 19:00.289
Eunuch.
Eunuch!

19:00.323 --> 19:02.691
- Eunuch!
- What? I couldn't hear you.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.626
( Pants ) I said eunuch.

19:04.661 --> 19:06.762
You're supposed to hear
a person's safety word.

19:06.796 --> 19:09.831
I'm sorry. Let's take a break anyway.
My arm's getting tired.

19:11.868 --> 19:15.336
Was this leather suit washed
since your last client?

19:15.370 --> 19:17.538
You can't wash leather.

19:17.572 --> 19:19.672
That's true.

19:19.707 --> 19:21.840
I do like the little
leather footies.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.609
It reminds me of the pajamas
I wore as a kid.

19:24.644 --> 19:26.711
I used to love to put them on
after my bath.

19:26.745 --> 19:28.780
Then I'd get to watch
a little more TV.

19:28.814 --> 19:30.515
You're a real chatty Cathy,
aren't you?

19:30.549 --> 19:32.550
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

19:32.585 --> 19:34.619
You're cute.

19:34.653 --> 19:36.354
So what do you do?
You don't have to tell me,

19:36.388 --> 19:37.722
but I like to know my clients.

19:37.756 --> 19:39.423
Well...
( Clears throat )

19:39.457 --> 19:41.024
I'm sort of
a struggling writer.

19:41.059 --> 19:43.259
I recently had
my second novel rejected.

19:43.294 --> 19:46.329
I did just start teaching for the
first time though last night.

19:46.363 --> 19:49.097
- Really? Where?
- Metropolitan writers' workshop.

19:49.132 --> 19:51.132
They have those green boxes
all over the city

19:51.167 --> 19:53.300
- with the brochures.
- I took a class there.

19:53.335 --> 19:55.002
<i>Maybe you could help me.</i>

19:55.036 --> 19:57.670
We could do a barter thing.

19:57.705 --> 20:01.340
I could give you a free session
and you could read my manuscript?

20:01.374 --> 20:03.041
Well, maybe.

20:03.075 --> 20:06.210
I'm telling you
I have a great book in me.

20:06.245 --> 20:10.281

there's so many stories.

20:10.316 --> 20:12.049

- Yes.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.417
That's great.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.888
- Why are you in leather?
- I had part of a session with mistress Florence.

20:57.922 --> 21:00.790
Oh, wow, I love her. She's very sympathetic.

You can't take me back to Brooklyn?

- That's not possible.

22:27.586 --> 22:29.554
Ah, whoa!

22:37.161 --> 22:38.461
Ah!

22:41.665 --> 22:42.965
Sorry.

22:45.568 --> 22:46.702
Ah!

22:50.207 --> 22:52.141
( Wheezing )

23:06.787 --> 23:08.420
Ah!

23:14.694 --> 23:17.963
<i>Man: George, we're very
happy to welcome you</i>

23:17.997 --> 23:21.131
and "edition" to
the Wellstone media family.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.229
Thank you.
I'm glad to be a new member.

23:23.263 --> 23:25.996
- I feel like a baby.
- Good.

23:26.031 --> 23:29.532
Well, it's our tradition to start our
meetings with the lord's prayer.

23:29.567 --> 23:31.200
<i>- Yes.
- So...</i>

23:31.235 --> 23:34.137
- Oh. - Our father,
who art in heaven...

23:34.171 --> 23:35.971
All:
Hallowed be thy name.

23:36.006 --> 23:38.040
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

23:38.074 --> 23:41.576
<i>- on earth as it is in heaven.
- ( Elevator dings )</i>

23:42.778 --> 23:44.245
I need to speak
to Mr. Christopher!

23:44.280 --> 23:46.680
I freelance here!

23:48.683 --> 23:50.150
George!
George!

23:50.184 --> 23:53.051
- George, George!
- ( Glass squeaks )

23:57.322 --> 24:00.157
This intruder says he knows you, 
Mr. Christopher.

24:00.191 --> 24:02.826
I have no idea who this is.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.428
- Call 911. - No! George!
Look, it's me!

24:06.463 --> 24:09.831
- It's Jonathan.
- Oh God.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.532
Jona...
( Groans )

24:11.567 --> 24:13.668
Um, I'll take care of this.
Thank you very much.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.103
This is a friend of yours,
Mr. Christopher?

24:16.138 --> 24:20.006
Uh... he's a writer
for the magazine.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.108
Um, I'll be right back.
Finish the prayer without me.

24:24.410 --> 24:26.045
I am fighting for the life
of this magazine

24:26.079 --> 24:30.283
and you show up like this... dressed
in an S&M snorkeling outfit?

24:30.318 --> 24:32.819
I was undercover on a case
in an S&M dungeon.

24:32.854 --> 24:35.654
I lost my wallet and my cell phone.
I had no choice.

24:35.689 --> 24:37.056
George, I'm sorry.

24:37.090 --> 24:39.191
Just wait in there.
I'll be right back.

24:39.225 --> 24:40.692
Wait wait wait wait, George.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.861
Can you get me out of this hood?
I'm locked in.

24:42.896 --> 24:44.863
Oh g... jeez.

24:44.897 --> 24:46.664
What am I gonna do
with you, Jonathan?

24:46.698 --> 24:48.365
Were you guys praying in there?

24:48.400 --> 24:50.234
Just turn around.

24:52.504 --> 24:55.239
I think Leah broke up with Ray.

24:55.273 --> 24:57.240
What?

24:57.275 --> 24:58.674
Oh no, that's terrible.

24:58.709 --> 25:00.276
I hope he'll be all right.

25:01.811 --> 25:04.179
Hey, did you make an
appointment at the urologist?

25:04.213 --> 25:05.580
No, not yet.

25:05.614 --> 25:07.882
If I hurt you, let me know.

25:07.916 --> 25:10.184
This hood is really locked on.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.651
If you hurt me,
I'll say eunuch.

25:11.686 --> 25:13.386
- What?
- It's my safety word.

25:13.420 --> 25:14.420
Eunuch!
