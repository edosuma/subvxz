SYMPOSIUM DIRECTOR: In looking
around this auditorium tonight,

00:03.137 --> 00:06.940
I am reminded of a comment
that Sir Isaac Newton made

00:07.007 --> 00:09.443
to the Royal Academy of
Science.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.446
Newton told the group
that doing math

00:12.513 --> 00:14.682
was like standing
on the shoulder of giants

00:14.748 --> 00:16.217
to see the future.

00:16.284 --> 00:19.820
But then of course,
in Newton's age,

00:19.887 --> 00:23.591
all the men wore shoes with
buckles and four-inch heels.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.458
( laughter )

00:24.525 --> 00:27.195
Each year,
we conclude this symposium

00:27.261 --> 00:29.197
by announcing the Milton Prize.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.799
And Professor Charles Eppes,
a past winner

00:31.865 --> 00:34.668
will present this year's award.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.204
( applause )

00:36.270 --> 00:37.771
I didn't know Charlie
won a Milton Prize.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.708
-Well, he was still
at Princeton... -Shh!

00:40.774 --> 00:41.709
This is important.

00:41.775 --> 00:42.876
Sorry.

00:42.943 --> 00:43.977
It is a great honor

00:44.044 --> 00:46.814
to present the Milton Prize.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.449
This year in particular,

00:48.516 --> 00:50.384
because I happen to know
the winner.

00:50.451 --> 00:55.523
To me, this person has become
much more than a colleague.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.726
We have collaborated closely
together

00:58.792 --> 01:00.027
on a number of projects.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.663
So without any further ado,

01:02.730 --> 01:06.234
the winner of this year's
Milton Prize...

01:06.300 --> 01:09.170
is Amita Ramanujan.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.705
( applause )

01:11.772 --> 01:14.208
Amita! It's you.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.453
Thank you all so much.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.588
I can't believe it.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.159
You got something else
you want to do tonight?

01:31.225 --> 01:34.428
It's Friday night, we're running
down anonymous tips.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.464
It was a call to Homeland
Security actually.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.166
Something going on
in a basement here.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.633
It's the garment district.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.534
Yeah?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.835
I'm thinking someone
with a sweatshop

01:41.902 --> 01:44.538
wants help putting the
competition out of business.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.039
Well, maybe we can
oblige them.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.075
-Gentlemen.
-Yeah, hey.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.477
You with the hotel?

01:49.543 --> 01:50.678
If this is about your luggage,

01:50.744 --> 01:52.146
we're doing everything we can
to find it.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.314
It's not about our luggage.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.515
You're not with
the convention group...

01:54.582 --> 01:55.849
-That's right.
-We received a tip about

01:55.916 --> 01:57.785
suspicious activity
in your basement.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.753
Suspicious act...?
What does that mean?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.789
It means you show us
the basement.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.758
Right this way, sir.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.862
So this is it.

02:08.929 --> 02:13.601
Careful, the floor's
a little uneven.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.804
What's in there?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.407
Uh, just some more rooms.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.808
-Let's go.
-CLERK: Okay.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.346
Seems pretty quiet.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.080
If the Health Department
was down here,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.449
they'd condemn the place.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.917
I don't think
the Health Department's

02:29.983 --> 02:31.319
ever been down here.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.122
What's in there?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.724
CLERK:
Uh...

02:36.790 --> 02:37.691
Storage, I think.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.727
-Never been inside.
-Open it.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.504
Whoa.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.241
Against the wall.
Against the wall.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.575
Where are the lights?

02:54.642 --> 02:55.876
-Right there.
-Turn them on.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.848
Behind your back.
Behind your back. Let's go.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.553
Yeah, we got a lot of blood
down here.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.787
We got a whole scene.
I want backup.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
Requesting backup
immediately.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.458
It's freezing in here.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.825
See this car battery?

03:14.462 --> 03:16.397
DAVID: What the hell
happened down here?

03:16.464 --> 03:18.532
Looks like some kind
of nightmare.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.768
( distant clattering )

03:20.834 --> 03:22.870
Hey, you hear that?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.239
( creaking )

03:41.154 --> 03:43.324
This way.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.163
DON:
This is the FBI!

03:50.230 --> 03:51.231
We need you to come out

03:51.299 --> 03:53.467
with your hands
where we can see them.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.871
This is the FBI.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.379
Hey.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.014
Okay, all right,
all right, take it easy.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.583
Hey, we're with the FBI.
You're okay.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.052
-( cries )
-It's okay. We're with the FBI.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.253
I'm not going to hurt you.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.322
We need an ambulance.

04:14.388 --> 04:39.413
Hotel Barclay, downtown L.A.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.781
COLBY:
If you know what you're doing,

04:40.848 --> 04:43.050
you can do a lot of damage
with a car battery.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.985
Is that a professional opinion?

04:45.052 --> 04:47.455
You see some things
working Military CID

04:47.521 --> 04:48.622
in Afghanistan.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.858
Things you'd rather not see.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.726
You really think this is
about torture?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
That would explain the girl.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.465
She's been traumatized
by something;

04:57.531 --> 04:58.999
Ican't get through to her.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.069
Begs the question
what it is she knows.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.604
And who else wants to know it.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.806
Hey, guys, I just got off
the phone to Washington.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
They want us wall to wall
on this.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.477
So I think you should
get back to that hotel,

05:09.543 --> 05:11.244
see if you can find anyone
who saw anything.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.045
It's a big place.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.747
A lot of people
coming in and out of there.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.649
Megan, how's the girl?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.284
Acute stress disorder.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.719
Showing signs of avoidance.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.355
I'm nowhere with her.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.623
Any idea where she's from?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.125
Right now I have her listed
as a foreign national,

05:25.192 --> 05:26.760
unknown circumstance.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.228
How about this car battery?

05:28.295 --> 05:29.563
I mean, what do you make of it?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.164
Well, that would explain

05:31.231 --> 05:34.001
why she's not even making
eye contact with me.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.036
All right, so what do we do?

05:36.103 --> 05:38.806
I mean, how do we reach her?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.074
Charlie, Don's probably
busy right now.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.242
We can tell him tomorrow.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.711
We're not going to be long.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.714
He's going to be
so happy that you won.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.455
( speaking foreign language )

06:04.732 --> 06:06.133
DON:
Whoa, look at you.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.535
Whoa, look at both of you.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.969
-What's going on?
-Hi.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.271
What's up?
What are you doing?

06:11.338 --> 06:12.239
We have dinner reservations
nearby,

06:12.305 --> 06:14.007
so we just thought we'd stop by
and say hello,

06:14.074 --> 06:15.676
-that's all.
-Is it a special occasion?

06:15.743 --> 06:19.079
Amita just won the Milton Prize
for her dissertation.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.349
That's a really big honor and it
comes with a cash award, so...

06:22.416 --> 06:24.418
-That's great. -So I guess
you're paying for dinner, huh?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.819
Congratulations.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.288
Thank you.
I wasn't expecting it.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.289
DON:
No?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.524
What happened here?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.728
That's the $64,000 question.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.497
You think that ice has anything
to do with it?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.065
Yeah, something.

06:38.131 --> 06:38.999
I mean, why?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.301
If I can take two of
these photos,

06:41.368 --> 06:44.872
I can probably tell you how long
the ice has been there.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.441
That'll at least give us
a starting point.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.510
-Yeah.
-See this plastic?

06:49.577 --> 06:52.312
This plastic is
a non-wetting surface.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.714
So I can do an interval analysis

06:53.781 --> 06:56.484
of the pooled water
that would...

06:56.550 --> 06:57.651
...help us determine
the rate of flow.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.986
Right. From there,
we can work backwards

06:59.052 --> 07:02.189
to determine when the ice first
started to melt.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.190
Well, how long would that take?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.324
Depends.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.827
The tricky part is figuring out
how fast the ice was melting.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.929
But once we know that,
we can determine

07:08.996 --> 07:10.731
how long it took
the puddle to grow,

07:10.798 --> 07:14.001
which is the result of two
competing forces-- the melting

07:14.067 --> 07:14.902
and the surface tension.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.937
-Surface tension?
-Molecules

07:17.004 --> 07:20.874
on the surface of water exhibit
strong cohesive properties.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
It's why certain bugs
can run over

07:22.175 --> 07:24.812
the top of a pond or why
raindrops are round.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.279
It's like a balloon.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.449
The rubber surface of a balloon
acts much like a puddle does--

07:29.517 --> 07:31.251
it constrains what's inside.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.187
So as air flows into a balloon,
it gets bigger.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.724
While how fast the balloon
grows depends on

07:36.790 --> 07:38.325
the rate of air
going into the balloon

07:38.391 --> 07:40.861
versus the strength
of the balloon's surface.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.195
Same thing goes for a puddle.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.398
As more water flows into
a puddle, it gets bigger.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.667
But the surface tension

07:46.734 --> 07:49.302
constrains the shape
of the puddle.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.437
All right, wait, just, just...

07:50.504 --> 07:51.839
what do you need from us
to do this?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.708
Um, if I can take the first
crime scene photo

07:54.775 --> 07:56.409
and the last.
I mean, that'll give us

07:56.476 --> 07:58.311
the greatest interval of time.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.514
Thanks, Charlie.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.549
Does that girl

08:01.615 --> 08:04.084
have something to do with this?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.520
Yeah, she does. Why?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.188
She said something to me.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.257
She spoke to you?

08:11.592 --> 08:12.860
Yeah, when I first came in.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.662
I think she was asking for help.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.996
Wait, in English?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.665
No, in Tamil.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.299
My family moved to

08:19.366 --> 08:20.400
the United States from Chennai

08:20.467 --> 08:22.302
in Southern India.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.737
Tamil is what they speak there.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.213
( speaking Tamil )

08:33.280 --> 08:36.383
What did she say?

08:36.449 --> 08:37.951
I'm not sure.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.853
I think she's asking for help.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.223
( speaking Tamil )

08:43.290 --> 08:46.660
Honestly, I haven't heard
much Tamil since

08:46.727 --> 08:48.228
I was really little.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.531
I think she may have said
something about her sister.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.567
Okay, um...

08:53.634 --> 08:55.368
I'm going to get a translator.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.004
-We can...
-Wait. Megan.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.472
Is it okay if I stay with her?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.775
Yeah. Yeah.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.486
Hi.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.924
My name is Amita.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.795
My name is Santi.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.667
I don't remember
seeing anything unusual.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.769
I was on the main level
most of the evening.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.337
Okay, maybe you
heard something--

09:30.403 --> 09:31.772
banging, screaming?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.073
Nothing like that.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.442
Is there more than one
ice machine in this building?

09:35.508 --> 09:37.377
Just the one
on the third floor.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.680
That means the ice didn't
come from the hotel.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.749
Cubes are the wrong shape.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.151
What's this room
usually used for?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.485
Nothing. It should've
been locked.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.587
A long time ago,
it was a laundry room.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.489
But we outsource
all that now.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.058
You have your
laundry delivered?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.059
Yes.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.794
What else do you guys
have delivered?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.529
Uh, staff uniforms,
morning papers...

09:56.596 --> 10:00.300
and a bakery brings the bread
for the continental breakfast.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.469
All right, we'll need
to see a schedule

10:02.535 --> 10:04.004
of all your deliveries.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.639
No problem.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.343
All right, we got
the same humidity.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.378
What else do we need
to know?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.380
Uh, we need to know
the heat-exchange rate

10:13.446 --> 10:15.849
as determined by the thermal
boundary layers of the ice.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.585
In essence, how fast ice melts.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.721
Right. Now we've replicated
all the variables involved,

10:20.788 --> 10:22.723
but the ice was sitting
on ice purity, humidity,

10:22.790 --> 10:25.558
air movement,
room temperature...

10:25.625 --> 10:27.260
Hey, what are you two doing?

10:27.327 --> 10:27.961
Hey, Dad.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.262
It's freezing in here.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.263
We're watching ice melt.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.999
Yeah, Don got us a temperature
reading from the crime scene.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.701
We set the house's thermostat
to match.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.603
Crime scene? What, did someone
kill an Eskimo?

10:36.670 --> 10:37.204
The ice is liquefying.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.206
LARRY:
Got a rather gruesome

10:39.272 --> 10:40.674
mystery here.

10:40.741 --> 10:45.045
Ooh... yeah...

10:45.112 --> 10:46.146
I can see that.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.214
What was it?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.215
We don't know.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.282
But whatever happened,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.219
it happened between 7:15
and 7:30 this morning.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.620
So we've got a time
for the crime.

10:53.687 --> 10:56.389
And depending what happened,
the time may be very important.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.759
For starters, we can tell
the FBI when witnesses

10:58.826 --> 10:59.793
might have seen something.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.894
Yeah, I see.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.163
You think you can get this
crime scene cleared up

11:03.230 --> 11:04.264
before breakfast?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.972
Charlie says the ice arrived

11:12.039 --> 11:13.841
yesterday right around
this time.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.909
Which means this
delivery guy might have

11:15.976 --> 11:17.610
been here then, too.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.946
Hey, are those still warm?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.180
You want one? Help yourself.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.315
-Thanks.
-I thought cops ate donuts.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.885
Well, we're FBI.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.086
You make a delivery here
yesterday morning?

11:26.153 --> 11:27.254
And the morning before that

11:27.320 --> 11:28.388
and the one before that.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.857
We're only interested
in yesterday, though.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.324
Did you notice anything
unusual?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.727
Nothing sticks out.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.594
What about somebody carrying in

11:34.661 --> 11:37.164
an unusually large
quantity of ice?

11:37.230 --> 11:40.633
Ice? No, I think I would've
remembered something like that.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.269
Sorry, guys.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.137
The ice had
to get in there somehow.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.406
Somebody had to deliver it.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.776
Hey, you didn't see
anybody else down here?

11:48.842 --> 11:50.610
It's just usually me
in the morning.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.246
But there was an ambulance.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.247
An ambulance?

11:54.314 --> 11:56.549
I think it was
a private company.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.485
It was parked over there.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.520
Thanks for your cooperation.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.721
You bet.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.261
All negative. I can run through
them again if you want.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.230
Hey, you guys get
anything from the 911 logs?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.933
Not that puts an ambulance
anywhere near the hotel.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.769
What about where
it went once it left?

12:15.836 --> 12:18.038
I could try
the emergency rooms.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.440
-Yeah. Let me know.
-Okay.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.745
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a girl

12:25.813 --> 12:26.746
that might have been

12:26.814 --> 12:28.181
brought in last night
who was Indian;

12:28.248 --> 12:30.017
extensive internal injuries.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.052
Dr. Jenloe was the attending.

12:32.119 --> 12:32.953
LAPD?

12:33.020 --> 12:36.189
FBI. The LAPD forwarded
me your report.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.891
What can you tell me
about the Jane Doe?

12:37.958 --> 12:41.194
Late teens, early 20s,
Southeast Asian,

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
came in with severe
internal bleeding.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.364
Do you know how
she was brought in?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.666
I don't know. You'd have to ask
at the front desk.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.700
They do all the
admitting paperwork.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.270
And what about her injuries?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.404
You don't know?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.339
Don't know what?

12:52.405 --> 12:55.675
I just figured that's why
the FBI was interested.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.878
Interested in what?

12:57.945 --> 13:00.047
She was hemorrhaging
and in shock.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.681
There wasn't anything
we could do.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.416
They had to break a rib.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.486
That's not uncommon
in this sort of procedure.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.160
Whoever performed it

13:13.226 --> 13:15.728
either didn't know
what they were doing

13:15.795 --> 13:18.631
or they made
a serious mistake.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.501
What kind of procedure
are we talking about?

13:21.568 --> 13:24.537
Someone removed
this girl's kidney.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.450
So the coroner just confirmed
what the ER doctor told me.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.587
The artery was severed
when they removed a kidney.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.656
And the blood in the hotel
matches the dead girl.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.993
All right, organ theft.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.794
I always thought
that was an urban legend.

13:47.861 --> 13:48.628
COLBY:
It's no legend, man.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.932
We were working
the villages outside Kandahar,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.400
these girls would show up
with new passports.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.002
They'd leave and come back
with new scars.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.270
Called them
"transplant tourists."

13:57.337 --> 13:58.805
And these girls did this
willingly?

13:58.872 --> 14:01.208
What's "willingly" when you're
poor and desperate, you know?

14:01.274 --> 14:02.409
Pay 'em a thousand bucks,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.078
it's like two or three years
salary for their families.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.113
So we're thinking

14:06.179 --> 14:07.447
someone's got
the girl's kidney, right?

14:07.514 --> 14:08.481
Yeah, but who?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.350
It's not like they're going
to come forward now.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.618
Right. If they knew how
the kidney was acquired,

14:11.684 --> 14:13.620
that would make them
an accessory to murder.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.687
Well, there's transplant lists.

14:14.754 --> 14:15.488
Maybe you could see

14:15.555 --> 14:16.823
if someone took themselves off
the last few days.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.926
I'll look into it.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.295
Thanks for coming.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.496
No problem.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.832
I think I'll actually
be helpful.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.367
I think you will.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.436
She really seemed to connect
with you last night.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.438
You were the one who figured out
she spoke English.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.906
I didn't actually
figure it out.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.174
She just started talking to me.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.910
( lock buzzes )

14:42.715 --> 14:44.351
Is Santi under arrest?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.619
No, but we do have to hold her

14:46.686 --> 14:49.022
at least until I get her story.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.792
The situation wasn't ideal,
but it was the best one I had.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.261
Thank you.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.262
Sure.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.864
Hi, Santi. I'm Agent Reeves.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.766
You remember Amita?

14:59.832 --> 15:02.569
Hi.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.505
We think we know what happened
at the hotel yesterday.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.040
It's okay.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.608
Agent Reeves is her to help.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.878
You asked me about your sister?

15:11.945 --> 15:15.682
You found her? You found Prita?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.620
We found her last night.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.001
No...

15:34.067 --> 15:36.169
I'm so sorry.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.206
This isn't my sister.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.675
This is Sonali.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.044
There were three of you?

15:44.111 --> 15:47.314
Four of us. Prita, me,
Jaya and Sonali.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.584
And you were all here
to sell your kidney?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.453
It's okay, Santi.
Anything you tell Agent Reeves

15:53.520 --> 15:55.188
will help her
find your sister.

15:55.255 --> 16:02.062
A man came to our village,
promised us each $1,000.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.196
Do you know who he is?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.364
Do you know what his name is?

16:04.431 --> 16:08.068
No. He was from the city,
from Chennai.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.071
How long have you been here?

16:11.138 --> 16:13.673
Five days.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.808
Where have you been staying?

16:15.875 --> 16:18.345
At the hotel.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.547
You mean where we found you?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.515
In a room upstairs.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.954
Later, they bring us
to the basement.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.390
It's okay.

16:30.457 --> 16:37.697
For the kidney, I was next,
but something happened to Sonali

16:37.764 --> 16:40.500
and everyone started to yell.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.437
And I think they forget me,
so I ran.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.275
How did you get back
to the basement?

16:49.776 --> 16:57.284
When I stop running, I am alone.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.055
You went back?

17:02.122 --> 17:06.226
Prita was still there.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.934
Hey, so there were four girls
staying at that hotel.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.269
Two of which are still missing.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.970
So that night manager
held out on us.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.573
Yeah. You and David should go
over and pick him up, huh?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.941
Hey, by the way,
did David get anything

17:22.008 --> 17:23.410
off those transplant lists?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.712
He did, yeah. There's a guy
named Benjamin Riley.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.946
Took himself off the list.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.715
Ends up in ICU with
complications

17:28.781 --> 17:30.049
from his new kidney.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.685
( knocking )

17:32.752 --> 17:35.755
-Dr. Bainsworth?
-I'm Alan Kelley.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.425
I'm with the hospital's
legal office.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.161
Dr. Bainsworth intends
to cooperate.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.028
And you're just here

17:42.095 --> 17:44.197
in the spirit of that
cooperation?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.898
What is it you'd like to know?

17:45.965 --> 17:46.866
For starters,

17:46.933 --> 17:49.569
how did you patient obtain
an illegal kidney?

17:49.636 --> 17:53.173
I advised him very strongly
against doing this.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.708
Oh, so he just showed up
with a black-market organ.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.076
You don't know anything
about it?

17:57.144 --> 17:59.712
I had nothing to do
with his transplant.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.481
But I still have
a responsibility to my patient,

18:01.548 --> 18:03.316
even if he chooses
to ignore my advice.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.652
You always do so what your
doctor tells you, Agent Reeves?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.255
We're not talking about lowering
my cholesterol.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.422
A girl was killed.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.124
Lawrence, don't respond to that.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.095
Where was she from?

18:16.163 --> 18:19.366
India.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.467
It's not surprising.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.068
There's an area
outside of Chennai.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.472
It's called "Kidney village."

18:25.538 --> 18:28.408
So you're saying there's regular
traffic in human organs?

18:28.475 --> 18:31.278
There are over 80,000 people
on the transplant waiting list

18:31.344 --> 18:36.383
in this country and, every day,
17 of them die waiting.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.252
I'd really like to speak
to your patient

18:39.319 --> 18:41.020
about who performed
this operation.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.622
His transplant took place

18:42.689 --> 18:44.691
in less-than-ideal
circumstances.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.360
He has post-operative sepsis;
a severe infection.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.661
He's in critical condition.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.164
So, what, he's too sick to talk?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.532
KELLEY: Andy knows
what he did was illegal.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.267
Whoever sold him the kidney
coached him to keep silent.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.936
I doubt he'd speak to you
even if he could.

18:57.003 --> 19:00.840
Then I want his blood work
and tissue samples

19:00.907 --> 19:02.475
and everything you have on him.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.179
The night manager
was a dead end.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.947
He quit the same day
we interviewed him.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.148
So he was in on it.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.917
Well, yeah, with him
in the wind,

19:10.983 --> 19:12.952
that leaves us with no
connection to these two girls.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.388
Well, the paperwork
from the emergency room said

19:15.455 --> 19:18.090
that the victim was brought in
by ambulance.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.526
Oh, so we trace that 911 call.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.695
I did that.
There as no 911 call.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.031
The ambulance was there
at the hotel waiting for him.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.334
The driver was in on it.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.001
Santi said something went wrong.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.070
Maybe the ambulance was
supposed to transfer an organ,

19:31.137 --> 19:34.774
ended up transporting
a body as well.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.978
( knocking )

19:39.045 --> 19:42.615
What's up?
It's the Milton Prize winner.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.218
Hey.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.153
You... you okay?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.356
Yeah.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.494
You know, we should reschedule
our celebration.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.296
Yeah.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.597
I don't know.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.299
I'm not really in the mood
to celebrate.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.033
Is it okay
if we hold off maybe?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.769
Yeah.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.542
You're upset for that girl
you met at the FBI, aren't you?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.980
I went to see her this morning.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.448
You know, Megan thought

20:15.515 --> 20:17.850
a familiar face
might help her cope.

20:17.917 --> 20:22.755
But I mean, how do you cope
with something like that?

20:22.822 --> 20:26.926
Besides, you know,
there's really not that much

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
in common between us.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.599
She comes from the same place
as your family.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.734
She does.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.604
But you know, I grew up
in California, Charlie.

20:37.670 --> 20:42.942
I know more about surfing
than I do about India.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.945
When I was little, you know,
kids used to make fun of me

20:46.012 --> 20:48.348
because I was different.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.550
But I didn't want
to be different.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.953
My grandmother used
to tell me stories

20:54.020 --> 20:56.356
about what it was like.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.958
I just tuned her out.

20:59.025 --> 21:03.129
And I wanted to push away
that part of who I am.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.998
You wanted to fit in here.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.237
But now, you know,
seeing this girl

21:11.304 --> 21:15.975
and what she's going through,
I have to help her,

21:16.042 --> 21:19.579
but I don't know how.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.982
I don't know what to say
and I don't know what to do...

21:23.049 --> 21:26.252
Well, maybe you should ask
your grandmother.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.687
I mean,

21:27.754 --> 21:29.121
she seemed
to have some good ideas.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.058
And even if you didn't
used to listen to her...

21:34.060 --> 21:35.895
Thank you, Charlie.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.597
You really are a genius.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.973
Are you the manager?

21:47.039 --> 21:49.576
-Yeah. -We're looking for
an ambulance of yours.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.844
It was seen parked
behind a hotel downtown.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.947
-You got a number? All the rigs
have numbers. -No, this one

21:55.014 --> 21:56.916
dropped off a patient at
the University General

21:56.983 --> 21:59.652
around 8:00 a.m.
day before yesterday.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.987
That'd be Proderman.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.622
He's still out
on the street.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.290
Yeah? Has he got a radio?

22:04.357 --> 22:04.957
Yeah.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.025
Call him back in.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.093
Actually I don't need to.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.028
That's him right now,
pulling in the driveway.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.236
( tires squeal )

22:17.303 --> 22:18.004
Hey!

22:19.572 --> 22:20.807
Let's go!

22:25.311 --> 22:27.414
( tires squeal )

22:28.848 --> 22:30.450
-( siren wailing )
-DAVID: Unit 365.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.118
DISPATCH:
365, go.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.653
In pursuit of a homicide suspect

22:33.720 --> 22:35.455
driving a red-and-white van...

22:35.522 --> 22:36.989
Look, it's an ambulance.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.592
We're driving west on Normandy.
Just crossed 54th.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.593
Requesting backup.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.730
Copy, 365.
All units be advised.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.433
First the night manager,
now the ambulance driver?

22:46.499 --> 22:50.169
365 requesting backup
at Normandy and 54th.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.771
Hold all radio traffic.

22:56.008 --> 22:56.743
( tires squeal )

22:56.809 --> 22:58.478
( siren wailing )

23:07.554 --> 23:08.621
He's not gonna make that turn.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.089
I don't think
this dude cares.

23:31.878 --> 23:36.082
Dispatch, suspect T.A.'d a taxi
at 56th and Normandy.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.385
Show us code six, requesting
emergency medical assistance.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.653
Hey, buddy, you're all right.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.188
You're gonna be fine--
why don't you just

23:42.254 --> 23:43.189
lay down and take it easy, okay?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.091
-All right? You all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.836
( man groaning )

23:56.903 --> 23:59.706
Paramedics are on the way.

23:59.772 --> 24:04.611
Well, maybe they can check
and see if he's a donor.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.888
Hi.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.627
Oh, no, this isn't official.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.062
We just came to see
how you were doing.

24:23.129 --> 24:27.166
Santi, this is
my friend, Charlie.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.901
Hello.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.469
Hi.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.974
So...

24:35.041 --> 24:38.244
how are you doing?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.747
I am okay.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.750
We brought you some stuff.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.317
Um, some clothes.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.086
-( phone ringing )
-And...

24:49.589 --> 24:51.257
-Here's some shampoo.
-Hello?

24:51.323 --> 24:52.959
Yeah. That's no problem.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.561
-I'll be right there.
-And a hairbrush.

24:54.627 --> 24:55.928
And...

24:55.995 --> 24:57.697
um, toothbrush and toothpaste.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.065
I've got to get back
to the FBI.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.600
You gonna be all right
in this place?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.802
-Yeah. I'll be fine.
-Okay.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.804
Santi, the FBI's doing

25:04.871 --> 25:06.873
everything they can
to find your sister.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.611
Thanks for coming with me.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.548
It will be very...

25:15.615 --> 25:19.051
nice to wash my hair.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.086
( laughs )

25:20.152 --> 25:23.422
I'm so glad to hear you
say that. Um...

25:23.489 --> 25:24.657
I didn't know what to get.

25:24.724 --> 25:28.828
I... You know, I don't know that
much about where you're from.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.597
You're not from India?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.298
No, I'm not.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.833
My family is.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.870
But I was born here
in California.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.439
Actually, I've never even been
to India.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.274
I could've gone once

25:42.341 --> 25:45.511
with my dad for business,
but I didn't...

25:45.578 --> 25:47.714
I didn't end up going.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.183
And what is it you
do in California?

25:51.250 --> 25:56.623
I work in math and astrophysics,
at a college.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.859
Uh, I-I'm in school.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.494
Oh. I was in school once.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.331
When I was little,
I liked school.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.869
Uh, I brought you
something else.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.239
My grandmother thought
you might like...

26:13.305 --> 26:16.075
to have this.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.948
For a puja.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.650
A prayer.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.219
Thank you.

26:28.955 --> 26:32.158
What's the red string for?

26:32.224 --> 26:34.627
We tie a bracelet after.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.363
To remember.

26:47.139 --> 26:51.310
Ah, the trip log we got
out of the ambulance?

26:51.377 --> 26:53.445
Yeah. I've been through
the entire thing,

26:53.512 --> 26:56.883
and every entry in it checks out
against the 911 calls.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.085
So Proderman was only
recording official trips.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.253
Doesn't leave us
much to go on.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.256
No, it doesn't--
which is why I called Charlie.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.457
He was nice enough

27:05.524 --> 27:07.393
to come down here
on short notice.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.728
Hey, Charlie.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.330
How you doing?
Thanks for coming down.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.300
I was around here-- I was at
that, uh, that detention center,

27:14.366 --> 27:15.334
with Amita and the girl.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.737
Is that that log book
you called me about?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.005
Yeah, it is,
but like I told you,

27:19.071 --> 27:20.272
it's just the official runs.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.275
Well, then you were probably
able to get the total distance

27:23.342 --> 27:25.577
driven by the driver
on each of his shifts.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.580
Well, yeah, the company records
daily mileages for each driver.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.116
How's that gonna help us,
Charlie?

27:30.182 --> 27:31.818
He still could have gone
anywhere.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.820
No, his destinations
are limited,

27:33.886 --> 27:36.355
by the total miles driven
in each shift.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.225
Okay, well, we still don't know
where he went,

27:39.291 --> 27:40.893
and more importantly,
where he could've

27:40.960 --> 27:42.394
-taken those other girls.
-Well, keep in mind

27:42.461 --> 27:44.964
that where he went couldn't
have been random, you know,

27:45.031 --> 27:46.365
his choices were influenced
by things:

27:46.432 --> 27:48.467
by the time of day,
and his location.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.368
So you mean like
if it was noon

27:49.435 --> 27:51.003
it's likely
that he went to lunch.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.105
Exactly.
So first what we'll do is,

27:53.172 --> 27:54.974
we'll take the total mileage
and plot

27:55.041 --> 27:57.777
all the possible routes, as well
as all the known destinations

27:57.844 --> 27:58.778
from the ambulance log.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.646
Then I can use
a Hidden Markov Model,

28:00.713 --> 28:02.982
as well as
an elliptical analysis

28:03.049 --> 28:04.416
to narrow
the possibilities

28:04.483 --> 28:06.485
of the most likely
hidden destinations

28:06.552 --> 28:07.686
and unrecorded routes.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.588
It's a...

28:09.655 --> 28:10.923
...it's a treasure map.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.925
We have ourselves a list
of starting points,

28:12.992 --> 28:15.762
routes, destinations, times,

28:15.828 --> 28:17.163
but it's incomplete.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.265
Not every stop is recorded.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.533
Now, based on what information
we do have,

28:21.600 --> 28:24.804
I can reveal the most likely
locations and times

28:24.871 --> 28:26.538
for the unrecorded stops.

28:26.605 --> 28:29.675
Imagine you held a candle
to the bottom of a treasure map

28:29.742 --> 28:32.945
to reveal the sections written
in invisible ink.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.214
DAVID: I don't know, Charlie,
it still feels like

28:35.281 --> 28:37.917
we're pretty much guessing
about where he went.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.919
Okay, yeah, a little a-at first.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.153
But this log
is extensive.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.455
I mean, it goes back
several months.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.624
So as we continue to analyze
the possibilities,

28:45.691 --> 28:46.893
patterns will emerge,

28:46.959 --> 28:48.160
and with all this data,

28:48.227 --> 28:49.962
my algorithm will
be able to tell us

28:50.029 --> 28:52.098
what his favorite place
for lunch is, you know,

28:52.164 --> 28:53.699
where he probably gets
his coffee,

28:53.766 --> 28:55.101
maybe where he shops for shoes.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.502
-Who knows?
-We just need it

28:56.568 --> 28:58.537
to tell us where
he could've taken those girls.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.140
Right.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.943
( door opens )

29:04.010 --> 29:06.145
DON:
Hello?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.015
Anyone home?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.283
ALAN:
Yeah. In the kitchen, Don.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.318
Hey, Dad.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.386
I made some coffee;
you want some?

29:14.453 --> 29:15.354
Nah.

29:15.421 --> 29:19.125
I could use a drink, though.
( groans )

29:19.191 --> 29:20.326
Oh?

29:20.392 --> 29:22.261
Tough day?

29:22.328 --> 29:24.964
We just got these two
missing girls from India.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.132
-India?
-Yeah.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.800
What are they doing here?

29:27.867 --> 29:30.336
Selling their kidneys,
believe it or not.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.470
Crazy, right?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.873
I mean, they're dirt poor,
they got a thousand bucks

29:33.940 --> 29:35.174
and a plane ticket here.

29:36.642 --> 29:38.477
What?

29:38.544 --> 29:40.679
Oh, I was thinking about my
friend Lou-- you remember him?

29:40.746 --> 29:42.381
He used to work for the Parks

29:42.448 --> 29:43.615
-Department of Recreation.
-Yeah, sure.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.953
Yeah, he died last year
of, um... kidney failure.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.288
I'm sorry, Dad,
I didn't know that.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.357
Yeah. I remember his family
was so desperate,

29:51.423 --> 29:54.026
they couldn't find a match
among them for a transplant.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.128
Not even his two brothers.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.964
You'd think brothers
would match.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.365
Well, actually,

29:59.431 --> 30:02.168
it's only one chance in four
when it comes to siblings.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.335
Hmm.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.005
They even tested me.

30:06.072 --> 30:10.576
And then they put him
on this long list.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.511
Waiting for a donor.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.581
Must've been hundreds
ahead of him.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.049
That man could've lived.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.518
Yeah, look, I see
what you're saying,

30:19.585 --> 30:23.055
but, you know, these kids are
dragged halfway across the world

30:23.122 --> 30:26.492
so some back-alley quack
can cut them up for parts.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.895
Yeah, I know,
I'm not saying it's right.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.529
I'm just saying...

30:30.596 --> 30:33.432
that when it comes to
looking at your own mortality,

30:33.499 --> 30:37.503
ah, you'd grab on to anything
to save your life.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.674
Hmm.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.511
All right, Larry, we've reached
the last few entries

30:45.577 --> 30:48.080
in the ambulance log,
and we've got...

30:50.549 --> 30:52.151
...point C-36. Okay?

30:52.218 --> 30:54.887
Uh, two kilometers
north-south,

30:54.954 --> 30:56.422
three east-west.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.191
You know, when I was
a child, I was plagued

30:59.258 --> 31:02.895
by a nightmare involving
the theft of my internal organs.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.530
You were?

31:04.596 --> 31:05.898
Yeah.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.901
Boy. Uh...

31:08.968 --> 31:11.637
Centering on, um...

31:11.703 --> 31:13.439
on point Y-12,

31:13.505 --> 31:15.041
half a click up,

31:15.107 --> 31:18.110
one kilometer side to side.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.845
The dreams recurred
in regular intervals

31:19.912 --> 31:22.681
till I was 13 years old--
it was horrible.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.782
Well, like what?

31:23.849 --> 31:25.751
Like, was there a monster
attacking you or something?

31:25.817 --> 31:28.854
Well, I mean, no.
Actually, it was my Aunt Louise.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.556
God, I can see her

31:30.622 --> 31:33.192
even now, wearing this hair net.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.527
All right,
this is the last coordinate.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.997
Uh, D-16.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.533
One by one and a half.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.970
And the 13th time

31:44.036 --> 31:45.471
is the charm.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.739
( exhales ):
The hospital again?

31:47.806 --> 31:49.341
Hospital again.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.843
( whispers ):
Wow.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.945
All right,

31:53.012 --> 31:54.213
so let's summarize.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.783
In our analysis,
University General shows up

31:57.849 --> 32:01.087
as a more likely destination
than any other place?

32:01.153 --> 32:02.421
Yeah. But it's not unusual

32:02.488 --> 32:04.656
for an ambulance to
go to a hospital.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.960
Yeah, but these were in addition
to his official stops.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.096
None of them were recorded.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.364
Which means the
ambulance driver

32:12.431 --> 32:16.002
may have had a contact
at University General.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.411
What are you...

32:25.477 --> 32:27.679
Hey, you're not supposed
to be down here.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.581
-Are you in charge?
-I'm the only one here.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.517
You ever run into
a guy named Proderman

32:31.583 --> 32:32.584
down here?

32:32.651 --> 32:33.252
Who are you?

32:33.319 --> 32:35.187
FBI. He drives
an ambulance.

32:35.254 --> 32:36.588
You know him or not?

32:36.655 --> 32:39.658
No. No, not really.

32:39.725 --> 32:40.726
Sounds a lot like a yes.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.630
I've seen him around-- he's
usually looking for Michael.

32:44.696 --> 32:45.531
Michael?

32:45.597 --> 32:47.866
Michael Tolchuck--
he works days

32:47.933 --> 32:49.135
in the morgue.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.003
And nights at
a hotel downtown?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.139
Where is he right now?

32:53.205 --> 32:55.841
I don't know.
I haven't seen him around.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.177
You know, I think maybe
I should just call my boss.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.745
I think
you should as well.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.180
Excuse me?

33:01.247 --> 33:04.750
You have paperwork
for four bodies right here.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.752
-So?
-So...

33:09.555 --> 33:10.389
I count five.

33:15.361 --> 33:19.031
Looks like she could be
one of our girls.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.632
Yeah.

33:25.404 --> 33:28.207
The morgue is actually
a great place to hide a body.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.575
It's ironic.

33:29.641 --> 33:34.246
Immigration showed Santi
the fax; this isn't her sister.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.514
Yeah, well, she's
a lucky girl,

33:35.581 --> 33:36.982
'cause he just gave me
his preliminaries.

33:37.049 --> 33:38.250
Both kidneys were taken.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.519
Liver, corneas,
even bone tissue.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.254
Well, if they took more
than a kidney,

33:42.321 --> 33:43.789
something's changed.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.193
Murder wasn't part
of the deal before.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.327
I think when
the first girl died,

33:48.394 --> 33:49.861
it was an accident.

33:49.928 --> 33:50.662
And after that,

33:50.729 --> 33:52.131
Tolchuck just decides
to cover his tracks.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.332
Makes the witness
problem a payday.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.867
He said that parts were
worth over 300 grand.

33:55.934 --> 33:56.935
$300,000?

33:57.002 --> 34:00.506
The organs are valuable if
they have a recipient match.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.142
And biotech firms
use skin, bone,

34:03.209 --> 34:04.843
even fat tissue
to make all sorts of

34:04.910 --> 34:06.145
implants and prosthetics.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.414
Well, if that's the case,

34:08.480 --> 34:11.417
Santi's sister is worth
more dead than alive.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.685
As long as he finds matches
for her organs.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.787
Which should give us a chance
to find Tolchuck first.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.324
Yeah. Mike, we'll see
you later; thanks.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.791
MEGAN:
Thank you.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.897
Doctors and hospitals
use an Optimization Theory

34:25.964 --> 34:29.468
developed at Johns Hopkins
to determine the best matches

34:29.535 --> 34:32.271
between organ donors
and recipients.

34:32.338 --> 34:35.174
If we only consider
a single variable--

34:35.241 --> 34:37.209
let's say, blood-type--
then the match

34:37.276 --> 34:39.845
between only two items
is simple to achieve.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.448
But transplant doctors are
trying to find complex matches

34:42.514 --> 34:44.450
for entire immune systems,

34:44.516 --> 34:46.518
based on a number
of variables:

34:46.585 --> 34:49.755
blood-type, a crossmatch
and a range of inmuno-proteins.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.591
An Optimization algorithm
is used to determine

34:52.658 --> 34:56.094
what donors are best
suited for each patient.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.063
Okay, so how do we use
any of this?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.698
Santi told me
that each of the girls

34:59.765 --> 35:02.033
was given a blood test to find
a match for their kidneys.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.170
Now, the National Organ
Sharing Network

35:04.236 --> 35:06.305
keeps blood-type,
crossmatch

35:06.372 --> 35:07.673
and HLA compatibility
information

35:07.739 --> 35:09.741
on every patient waiting
for a transplant.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.677
So, what, we run the sister's
results against that

35:11.743 --> 35:13.612
to find out where
the kidney will wind up?

35:13.679 --> 35:16.047
Exactly. We might be able to
determine the transplant patient

35:16.114 --> 35:17.649
before the surgery takes place.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.785
-Yeah, but there's one thing.
-What's that?

35:19.851 --> 35:22.221
We don't have any blood work
on the missing girl.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.455
CHARLIE:
No, we don't,

35:23.522 --> 35:26.358
but we can run blood and HLA-
compatibility tests on Santi.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.926
CHARLIE: We can use her results;
they're sisters.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.461
DON:
From what I understand,

35:29.528 --> 35:30.862
there's only one in four chances

35:30.929 --> 35:31.530
that siblings will match.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.931
Well, a one-in-four chance

35:32.998 --> 35:34.433
is better than no chance at all.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.405
Sorry, Amita,

35:39.471 --> 35:41.640
but Santi's data just isn't
producing a result.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.275
Well, then let's test
the algorithm

35:43.342 --> 35:44.276
against known matches.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.211
We already tried that.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.913
Amita, I don't think
the equation's the problem.

35:47.979 --> 35:52.117
Then the database of patients
waiting for transplants

35:52.184 --> 35:53.785
must be an incomplete set.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.688
You know, if we consider we're
dealing with a black market,

35:56.755 --> 35:59.358
it's possible, even probable,

35:59.425 --> 36:00.359
that we're looking
for a patient

36:00.426 --> 36:01.393
who cannot obtain an organ

36:01.460 --> 36:02.661
in the normal way.

36:02.728 --> 36:06.131
So they wouldn't be
on any official lists.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.799
Yeah, but it's much more likely

36:07.866 --> 36:09.868
that Santi isn't a match
for her sister.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.003
I was hoping this would work.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.505
Yeah, well, we all were.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.408
Well, we aren't giving up.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.444
Wow, this doesn't look good.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.279
MEGAN: I assume you guys haven't
found anything yet.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.647
No. Well, you know,

36:21.713 --> 36:24.015
we're only working
with a 25% chance

36:24.082 --> 36:25.551
of success to begin with.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.286
And absence of proof
is not the same thing

36:27.353 --> 36:28.554
as a proof of failure.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.121
Yeah, she's right
about that.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.657
She's right about what?

36:31.723 --> 36:34.159
We don't know that Santi
isn't a match for her sister.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.695
We only know that
we aren't getting any results

36:36.762 --> 36:38.297
from this current set
of patients.

36:38.364 --> 36:39.931
Well, David and Colby found

36:39.998 --> 36:40.966
some data on
the patients

36:41.032 --> 36:43.201
in Tolchuk's computer
at the morgue.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.169
Let me see.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.871
This is a potential list
of customers?

36:45.937 --> 36:47.205
We think so.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.375
Our elusive black-marketeers?

36:56.382 --> 36:57.749
-We have a match.
-Thank God.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.985
Well, now that we know
where the kidney is going,

37:00.051 --> 37:01.487
what I need to do is find

37:01.553 --> 37:03.221
Santi's sister
before she gets there.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.595
Dad...

37:09.661 --> 37:12.298
these people,
they're from the FBI.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.800
They want to ask you
some questions.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.802
What kind of questions?

37:16.868 --> 37:18.604
Sir, I'll make this
as quick as possible.

37:18.670 --> 37:22.040
Are you aware that buying human
organs is a Federal crime?

37:22.107 --> 37:25.344
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.912
Mr. Eckworth, two women
have been murdered.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.080
There's still another girl
out there.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.617
Who happens to be
a perfect donor match for you.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.118
JANET:
What girl?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.653
What are talking about?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.154
We're investigating
a murder of two girls

37:36.221 --> 37:38.089
who were killed
for their body parts.

37:38.156 --> 37:40.025
I said I don't know

37:40.091 --> 37:41.760
anything.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.496
My father really isn't well,

37:44.563 --> 37:46.365
and I need to
get back to work.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.834
So, if there's
nothing else...

37:48.900 --> 37:50.702
All right.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.270
Thanks.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.843
He's lying.
You saw that.

37:57.909 --> 37:58.677
Yeah.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.312
So why did you take
us out of there?

38:00.379 --> 38:01.580
I don't think
he's going to talk.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.550
and I think she's been
in the dark until now, you know?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.785
So he really thought people
we're trying to find

38:06.852 --> 38:08.787
are gonna save his life
and he's never gonna talk?

38:08.854 --> 38:11.122
You see the way she looked
when you said "murdered"?

38:11.189 --> 38:13.191
You think I should
talk to her?

38:13.258 --> 38:16.294
I think he made the choice,

38:16.362 --> 38:18.997
and she's finding out
what it entails.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.746
My father told you
he didn't know anything.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.482
Right now, I'm not that
interested

38:36.548 --> 38:37.883
in what your father knows.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.586
Without a new kidney,
my father will die.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.455
But he has a blood disorder
that disqualifies him

38:43.522 --> 38:44.590
from getting a transplant.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.892
I know this is difficult.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.460
Difficult?

38:48.527 --> 38:51.997
Every day I watch as my dad
dies a little bit more.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.199
You know, he raised me.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.535
It was always just
the two of us.

38:56.602 --> 38:59.004
You know, none of this
wouldn't be happening

38:59.070 --> 39:01.306
if I were a match,
if I could give him a kidney.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.376
I'm sure you'd do anything
to save your father.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.778
But two girls have
already been killed.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.680
I don't know
anything about that.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.616
Maybe not before,
but now you do,

39:10.682 --> 39:12.317
and there is another
girl out there

39:12.384 --> 39:13.452
just waiting to
be carved up.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.622
Look, I'm sure you would do
anything to save your father,

39:16.688 --> 39:18.424
but this may not
be the best way.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.760
The last person who received
a transplant from these people

39:21.827 --> 39:24.696
died a few hours ago
from massive infection.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.538
He told me that I need
to be ready to pick him up

39:32.604 --> 39:34.706
to take him to the hospital.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.908
From where? And when?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.376
At a hotel.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.579
Tomorrow.

39:43.749 --> 39:48.119
In Romania, I was a surgeon at
the best hospital in Bucharest.

39:48.186 --> 39:53.992
Now I'm reduced to washing
my hands in a toilet.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.665
I made one mistake....

39:59.731 --> 40:03.602
on a patient who would have
died in six months anyway.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.040
TOLCHUCK:
Tomorrow...

40:09.107 --> 40:11.409
I'm retiring.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.946
What do you plan to do
with your share?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.616
Forget I asked.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.692
-( door slams open )
- FBI!

40:26.758 --> 40:29.595
-FBI! Tolchuck, let's go!
-Drop it!

40:29.661 --> 40:30.562
MEGAN:
Turn around!

40:30.629 --> 40:31.697
Put your hands behind
your back-- Prita?

40:31.763 --> 40:34.099
Jimmy, put them up!

40:34.165 --> 40:35.300
-MEGAN: Prita?
-Jimmy, get in here.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.769
Prita, can you hear me?
We need a medic!

41:10.536 --> 41:13.238
( crying )

41:16.708 --> 41:19.010
How did you know
she would be okay?

41:19.077 --> 41:21.913
You gave us the
information we needed.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.551
And I believe in the people
that were looking for her.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.886
And, uh...

41:27.953 --> 41:29.487
Thank you.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.557
( crying )

41:39.197 --> 41:41.199
Mmm, that smells
so good.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.100
I hope it's good.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.569
It's embarrassing, but I
actually had to ask

41:43.635 --> 41:44.903
my grandmother what to get.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.805
It was absolutely unnecessary
for you to buy dinner for us.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.174
Well, after what Don did
to get Prita and Santi

41:49.240 --> 41:51.242
out of the detention center,
it's really the least I can do.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.243
Where is Don anyway?

41:52.310 --> 41:55.046
He should be here by now.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.982
So, what's gonna happen
with these girls, Amita, huh?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.786
What?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.554
Amita is using the money

42:02.621 --> 42:04.422
from the Milton Prize

42:04.489 --> 42:07.125
to...
Why don't you tell them?

42:07.192 --> 42:09.494
I'm going to use the money
to pay for the girls

42:09.561 --> 42:10.929
to go back to school.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.531
LARRY: That's an admirable use
of your award-- let me know if

42:13.599 --> 42:14.800
I can contribute in any way.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.802
That's sweet, but it's
actually not necessary.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.236
I'll have enough money
to pay the tuition

42:18.303 --> 42:20.305
and have extra left over
for a trip I want to take.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.140
You're going to India.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.444
Yeah, with my grandmother,
over spring break.

42:26.511 --> 42:27.679
Hey, that's, that's great.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.180
DON:
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.616
I got stuck at the DMV.

42:30.682 --> 42:31.983
What were you doing
at the DMV?

42:32.050 --> 42:35.420
Oh, I'm now officially
an organ donor.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.287
Check it out.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.023
ALAN:
Hey, look at that.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.157
Cool.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.325
DON:
Nice, huh?

42:40.391 --> 42:41.359
So now I get treated

42:41.426 --> 42:43.394
with a little more respect
around here, huh?

42:43.461 --> 42:45.030
You know, more people took
that simple step,

42:45.096 --> 42:46.564
can you imagine
the ramifications?

42:46.632 --> 42:49.534
Basic economic theory: Black
markets rely on a shortage

42:49.601 --> 42:50.568
of a regulated commodity.

42:50.636 --> 42:51.369
LARRY:
That's right.

42:51.436 --> 42:53.839
Increase the supply,
the black market disappears

42:53.905 --> 42:55.473
Here's a couple
extra applications

42:55.540 --> 42:56.441
in case anyone wants.

42:56.507 --> 42:57.976
That's all right.
I already got my sticker.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.311
LARRY: Yeah, look, I've been
an organ donor for years.

43:00.378 --> 43:01.647
AMITA:
Yeah, me, too.

43:01.713 --> 43:02.714
What about you, Charlie?

43:02.781 --> 43:03.715
I don't know. I...

43:03.782 --> 43:04.716
kind of want to hold on

43:04.783 --> 43:06.451
to my internal organs, you know.

43:06.517 --> 43:07.619
ALAN:
Uh, Charlie,

43:07.686 --> 43:08.586
they don't actually
take them

43:08.654 --> 43:09.454
until you've finished with them.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.189
I'm aware of that, Father.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.924
Yeah, well, there's nothing
to worry about.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.693
It's just, you know,
what if I'm not dead

43:14.760 --> 43:15.794
and they think I'm dead,

43:15.861 --> 43:18.630
because I, like, look dead?

43:20.065 --> 43:21.733
Yeah, well, in your case,
I can see that happening.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.734
Don't worry, Charlie.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.002
You got your family
around to make sure

43:24.069 --> 43:25.003
something like that
never happens.

43:25.070 --> 43:26.805
Yeah, Chuck, we got your back.

43:28.406 --> 43:29.775
Your spleen...

43:29.841 --> 43:30.776
( laughter )

43:30.842 --> 43:31.810
ALAN:
I got his heart.

43:31.877 --> 43:34.045
It his brain that I think
people want.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.681
Maybe we should keep that
and put it on eBay.

43:35.747 --> 43:37.215
No, that goes to a museum.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.316
( laughter )
