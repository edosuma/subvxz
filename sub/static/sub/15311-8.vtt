<i>NARRATOR: Previously on Hostages.</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:04.570
This is Vanessa Moore. My sister.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.606
You are a beautiful woman.

00:06.608 --> 00:10.042
<i>KRAMER: This guy came at us.
He pulled a gun. I killed him.</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:12.111
- Kramer Delaney?
- Why do you wanna talk to me?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.780
I can explain downtown.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.516
I'd like you to meet Special
Agent Carlisle with the FBI.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.552
He's helping us in our
investigation into the

00:19.554 --> 00:21.354
disappearance of your friend, Angela.

00:21.356 --> 00:23.522
So what do you think?
She telling the truth?

00:23.524 --> 00:26.625
My gut tells me she's credible.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.460
There's just no way out of this.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.363
- Unless...
- Unless what?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.798
We kill him.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.532
What about the poison he gave you?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.701
We just need some professional help here.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.537
I don't have a lot of
killers on my speed dial. You?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.206
I might know someone who does.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.441
- Ellen?
- I need help.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.810
Of course. Tell me everything.

00:48.781 --> 00:50.715
- Who is this?
- We have a lot to discuss.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.152
Killing Duncan is a terrible mistake.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.788
The second he's dead, my
partners will cut their losses

00:56.790 --> 00:59.123
and slaughter each and every one of us.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.424
<i>Brian, it's me.</i>

01:00.426 --> 01:01.625
Just... I'll explain everything later,

01:01.627 --> 01:02.994
but call me back, as soon as you can, okay?

01:05.129 --> 01:06.097
Nice job.

01:13.906 --> 01:15.006
No, no, no, no, no!

01:20.645 --> 01:21.745
Stop!

01:24.382 --> 01:26.116
(GRUNTING)

01:26.118 --> 01:27.284
(DUNCAN GROANING)

01:32.427 --> 01:33.513
We need him alive.

01:35.918 --> 01:36.836
Don't move. Don't, don't.

01:36.837 --> 01:38.590
We need to minimize the poison
spreading through your body.

01:38.594 --> 01:39.894
Let me do it.

01:39.896 --> 01:41.962
I spoke to Burton, I get
it. If you die, we die.

01:49.604 --> 01:52.806
What the hell are you doing?
This is our chance, just kill him!

01:52.808 --> 01:55.342
Just do it, just get it over with!

01:55.344 --> 01:58.044
- Just do it!
- We can't. I'll explain later.

01:58.046 --> 02:00.013
Please just get my medical
bag, I need a scalpel.

02:00.015 --> 02:01.648
Why the hell are you doing this?

02:01.650 --> 02:03.383
This is the poison you gave
me to use on the President.

02:03.385 --> 02:05.686
- Some of it went in. I need to know what it is.
- It's a paralytic.

02:05.688 --> 02:09.521
It's fast acting. I'll lose muscle
function, the ability to breathe, speak.

02:12.092 --> 02:15.261
I'm not dead yet, you move an inch
and I'll put you down for good.

02:15.263 --> 02:17.396
- Drop it.
- ELLEN: How much time do we have?

02:17.398 --> 02:19.199
- A few minutes.
- I need to cut it out.

02:19.201 --> 02:20.900
There's a knife in my hip, use it.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.270
(GROANING)

02:25.272 --> 02:26.672
This is gonna hurt.

02:26.674 --> 02:30.376
Ellen, just kill him. Do this,
and we get our lives back.

02:30.378 --> 02:32.311
Everything just goes away.

02:35.081 --> 02:36.081
Ah.

02:38.385 --> 02:39.751
We need ice.

02:39.753 --> 02:42.321
Brian, like it or not, our
lives depend on his right now.

02:42.323 --> 02:43.753
There are other people behind this,

02:43.754 --> 02:45.512
and if he dies, they will come for us.

02:45.559 --> 02:46.992
You need to trust me.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.967
Stay with me, Duncan. Stay with me.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.462
Two more minutes and
you would have been dead.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.770
The wound will heal in a couple of days.

03:37.674 --> 03:40.242
You made the right decision last night.

03:40.244 --> 03:44.714
Well, I can see the full picture
now. We are in this together.

03:44.716 --> 03:47.483
- Which is why I'm willing to cooperate.
- Good.

03:49.719 --> 03:52.721
But there's something else
we need to be clear on.

03:55.392 --> 03:57.960
You went to my daughter's school.

03:57.962 --> 04:01.030
My family is off-limits to
you, do you understand that?

04:04.267 --> 04:05.767
Stay away from them.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.850
(CLEARING THROAT)

04:26.155 --> 04:28.122
His name is Tim Grace.

04:28.124 --> 04:33.061
He's 46 years old. Private
security guard and limo driver.

04:33.063 --> 04:34.462
Right.

04:34.464 --> 04:37.432
Like I said, I've never seen the guy.

04:37.434 --> 04:39.867
He died last night. Got in a fight.

04:39.869 --> 04:42.670
That's too bad, but I have no
idea what that has to do with me.

04:42.672 --> 04:45.205
A surveillance camera two
blocks away from the crime scene

04:45.207 --> 04:46.851
picked up a dark, four-door sedan

04:46.852 --> 04:48.879
leaving the area shortly
after this happened.

04:50.045 --> 04:51.879
The car is registered to you.

04:51.881 --> 04:53.848
So, I'm here because I was in Bethesda?

04:53.850 --> 04:55.548
We gotta start somewhere, right?

04:55.550 --> 04:58.151
So, look, just to cross you off the list,

04:58.153 --> 05:00.053
tell me what you were
doing up there that night.

05:01.655 --> 05:04.624
Stop talking to my client.

05:04.626 --> 05:06.126
Okay, Kramer, let's go.

05:06.128 --> 05:09.329
- Well, who the hell are you?
- His father. And lawyer.

05:09.331 --> 05:11.865
- We're done.
- I didn't say the interview was over.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.466
Are you charging him with anything?

05:15.135 --> 05:16.970
Then it's over. Let's go.

05:20.574 --> 05:23.109
I put that needle in his
body and you took it out.

05:23.111 --> 05:25.144
I told you, killing him
would not solve our problem,

05:25.146 --> 05:27.679
this is a conspiracy that
goes way beyond Duncan.

05:27.681 --> 05:30.483
According to the lawyer. Who's part of it.

05:30.485 --> 05:31.984
What makes you believe him?

05:31.986 --> 05:34.420
Open your eyes, Brian, the
Secret Service, the FBI,

05:34.422 --> 05:36.489
this is much bigger than any one man.

05:36.491 --> 05:37.890
So what?

05:37.892 --> 05:39.158
You're not even listening to me.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.460
If I'd killed him, we'd all be dead.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.350
What's your plan?

05:42.351 --> 05:44.774
You're gonna trust some guy who's
trying to kill the President?

05:44.832 --> 05:46.431
We need to figure out the big picture.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.267
- Who's behind this, and why?
- Where do we even start?

05:49.269 --> 05:52.168
Burton, Kramer, Duncan,
they're all related.

05:52.169 --> 05:53.520
I say we start with his family.

05:53.707 --> 05:54.999
He warned you to stay
away from his daughter.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.307
You'll never get near her again.

05:57.110 --> 05:59.011
That's why I'm going after his wife.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.582
This is a medical bill for Nina Carlisle.

06:04.584 --> 06:06.484
She's a patient at Beth Zion hospital.

06:06.486 --> 06:09.587
- You are out of your mind.
- Nope.

06:09.589 --> 06:11.156
Just determined.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.207
The Dutch ambassador will
make the opening remarks

06:20.208 --> 06:21.464
at the reception tomorrow night.

06:21.501 --> 06:23.434
All you need to do is stay awake.

06:23.436 --> 06:26.037
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was out of line.

06:26.039 --> 06:27.605
Forget it.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.640
I wish your sister was that forgiving.

06:29.642 --> 06:31.609
- Who said I forgave you?
- Huh.

06:32.911 --> 06:36.180
Hello, Quentin. Vanessa,
have you met Colonel Blair?

06:36.182 --> 06:39.849
Not in person, but I read about
your appointment to the NSA.

06:39.851 --> 06:43.487
DC must be a nice change
from Bagram Air Force Base.

06:43.489 --> 06:45.489
The food is better. Traffic is worse.

06:46.791 --> 06:49.159
Mr. President, gentlemen,
I'll leave you to it.

06:54.565 --> 06:55.599
Have a seat.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.637
You can shut the door.

07:02.607 --> 07:06.009
I want to talk about
Operation Total Information.

07:06.011 --> 07:08.377
Colonel Blair, I know that
you've been running point

07:08.379 --> 07:10.879
on this program since
you arrived at the NSA.

07:10.881 --> 07:14.250
- How's it going?
- OTI's been a valuable tool for us, Mr. President.

07:14.252 --> 07:16.891
We've used it to thwart
hundreds of terrorist attacks.

07:16.899 --> 07:19.989
Yeah, I understand. But I've
decided it's time to give it up.

07:21.391 --> 07:23.425
Mr. President, I thought

07:23.427 --> 07:25.869
you weren't going to make
any major policy moves

07:25.870 --> 07:27.726
until after the midterm elections.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.331
I changed my mind.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.735
Are you sure that's prudent?

07:32.737 --> 07:35.437
- OTI could be a political disaster for us.
- Exactly.

07:35.439 --> 07:39.141
It's unconstitutional.
It's invasive. Illegal.

07:39.143 --> 07:41.309
When the American people
find out the extent to which

07:41.311 --> 07:44.078
this government's been secretly
spying on its own citizens... 

07:44.080 --> 07:47.469
Surveillance devices in cars? Computers?

07:47.470 --> 07:48.470
They're gonna demand my head on a stake.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.756
- OTI has to end.
- You want to dismantle it.

07:54.758 --> 07:59.160
- I want to expose it.
- But why take the risk?

07:59.162 --> 08:02.830
Right now, nobody even knows OTI exists.

08:02.832 --> 08:04.632
Well, this is Washington, Quentin.

08:04.634 --> 08:07.969
It's never a question of if
something will be leaked, but when.

08:07.971 --> 08:10.538
This is a time bomb. And I
want to get in front of it.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.574
- But, Mr. President...
- I understand completely, sir.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.678
You want to control the
message. It makes sense.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.147
The program was already in
place before you took office.

08:20.149 --> 08:24.485
But, you couldn't expose it until
now, for national security reasons.

08:24.487 --> 08:27.988
Exactly. Claim the moral high ground.

08:27.990 --> 08:30.824
When were you thinking of
making this announcement?

08:30.826 --> 08:32.558
Well, I haven't decided.

08:32.561 --> 08:36.229
Soon. I wanted to give
you both a heads-up.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.565
I appreciate your getting
on board with this, Colonel.

08:48.809 --> 08:52.178
Hoffman asked me to pull financial
records for Ellen Sanders.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.299
What exactly does he know?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.092
It's not what he knows,
it's where he's looking.

08:55.650 --> 08:58.150
He keeps coming back to Dr. Sanders.

08:58.152 --> 09:00.820
She's linked to the surgery,
the blood thinner incident,

09:00.822 --> 09:03.455
Angela's disappearance, the men in the bar.

09:03.457 --> 09:05.958
- Does he have any hard evidence?
- Nothing.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.594
But he's convinced that she
hasn't told him everything.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.830
Has he talked about this with anybody else?

09:10.832 --> 09:12.098
I don't think so.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.342
BURTON: Good to see you, Jimmy.
Don't mean to put you on the spot.

09:23.344 --> 09:26.845
JIMMY: Please, I've known your kid
since he was ten, happy to help.

09:26.847 --> 09:28.880
Here you go.

09:28.882 --> 09:30.982
Appreciate your help, as always.

09:37.089 --> 09:39.924
Logan tells me you're still
investigating Dr. Sanders.

09:39.926 --> 09:40.479
Yeah.

09:41.442 --> 09:43.286
There are pieces that don't add up, and...

09:43.287 --> 09:44.974
too many of them connect to her.

09:45.465 --> 09:46.478
So, what are you thinking?

09:46.479 --> 09:48.560
This is a personal thing
with her and the nurse?

09:48.568 --> 09:50.201
Or something more?

09:50.203 --> 09:51.331
What I'm going on is a hunch.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.758
The blood thinners, they weren't a mistake.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.674
You think Dr. Sanders is part
of a plot to kill the President?

09:56.676 --> 09:58.108
Maybe.

09:58.110 --> 10:00.844
Well, if you're right, then there
has to be some sort of motive.

10:00.846 --> 10:03.981
- Have you checked her financial records?
- Logan is working on it.

10:03.983 --> 10:06.150
Does she have a political history?

10:06.152 --> 10:08.819
Not that I'm aware of,
but I'll keep looking.

10:08.821 --> 10:11.155
Maybe somebody is pressuring her.

10:11.157 --> 10:13.690
I'll swing by the house, see
if there's any unusual activity.

10:13.692 --> 10:16.593
- Talk to the neighbors, what have you.
- Thank you.

10:16.595 --> 10:18.328
This is probably a wild goose chase, but... 

10:18.330 --> 10:20.964
But we have to investigate
every possibility.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.949
No matter how remote.

10:24.069 --> 10:26.836
It's a long shot, but if this
is some sort of conspiracy,

10:26.838 --> 10:29.138
we have no idea who else might be involved.

10:34.612 --> 10:37.880
Maybe we should keep this between
you, me, and Logan, for now.

10:37.882 --> 10:39.783
I agree.

10:39.785 --> 10:40.950
(KNOCKING ON TABLE)

10:48.525 --> 10:52.094
Hey. Do you have a list of
today's patient transfers?

10:52.096 --> 10:53.529
I'll print it out for you.

10:59.902 --> 11:01.102
BLAIR: Come in.

11:04.674 --> 11:05.674
I'll call you back.

11:09.446 --> 11:11.187
I'm sorry about this morning.

11:11.188 --> 11:13.480
It was a complete surprise to me as well.

11:13.484 --> 11:14.823
You're his Chief of Staff.

11:15.376 --> 11:16.927
You're not supposed to be surprised.

11:17.187 --> 11:18.185
Well, I can't control him.

11:19.106 --> 11:20.944
I told you that when we started this thing.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.728
Shut the door, Quentin.

11:35.105 --> 11:36.639
Shut the door, Quentin.

11:44.114 --> 11:47.450
Colonel, it's a pleasure.

11:47.452 --> 11:50.652
Our mutual friend speaks
very highly of you.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.721
- Likewise. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

11:59.328 --> 12:02.898
Can I speak freely here?

12:02.900 --> 12:05.067
(CHUCKLING) If not here, where?

12:05.069 --> 12:07.302
This is the most secure
building in the country.

12:07.304 --> 12:10.738
The NSA is lucky to have you.

12:10.740 --> 12:14.792
The work you're doing with
Operation Total Information is...

12:14.793 --> 12:16.449
of vital importance.

12:16.679 --> 12:17.580
Thank you.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.290
Now, unfortunately,

12:20.672 --> 12:24.190
not everybody appreciates
the value of what you do here.

12:25.155 --> 12:26.039
What would you say,

12:26.767 --> 12:29.260
if I were to tell you that the President

12:29.261 --> 12:31.247
wants to eliminate OTI?

12:31.273 --> 12:35.309
- I would say that would be a tragic mistake.
- I agree.

12:35.311 --> 12:38.379
And that's why our mutual
friend wanted us to meet.

12:38.381 --> 12:39.747
Do you want to say it
out loud, or should I?

12:42.017 --> 12:44.551
I heard you were direct.

12:44.553 --> 12:46.420
It's refreshing.

12:46.422 --> 12:49.956
Better that this President die than
undermine our nation's security.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.425
He has a tumor on his lung.

12:53.261 --> 12:55.862
He's scheduled to undergo surgery shortly.

12:55.864 --> 12:57.297
Is that dangerous?

12:59.767 --> 13:01.434
Could be.

13:01.436 --> 13:02.602
What do you need from me?

13:07.742 --> 13:11.678
Duncan assured me the President would
be dead by now. This is his fault.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.312
- He's the one who...
- Stop being a baby.

13:13.314 --> 13:16.549
This isn't about assigning blame,
this is about finding a solution.

13:16.551 --> 13:20.486
We need to know exactly when Kincaid
plans to go public, and that is on you.

13:20.488 --> 13:23.056
And what if that's before
the scheduled surgery?

13:23.058 --> 13:26.292
Well, we re-evaluate where
we stand with everything.

13:26.294 --> 13:27.660
And everyone.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

ARCHER: Hello?

13:40.775 --> 13:43.542
One of my patient's is being
transferred to an off site surgery,

13:43.544 --> 13:45.444
I need to go with him to assist.

13:45.446 --> 13:46.912
What's the patient's name?

13:46.914 --> 13:49.414
Cornfeld. It's a heart transplant.

13:49.416 --> 13:52.750
<i>- What hospital are you going to?
- Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.</i>

13:52.752 --> 13:55.387
Surgery will last at least six hours.

13:55.389 --> 13:57.547
- I'll follow you.
- Well, that won't be so easy,

13:57.550 --> 13:59.958
<i>we're leaving on the
medevac chopper right now.</i>

14:06.632 --> 14:08.499
You call me the minute
the surgery's finished.

14:26.118 --> 14:28.291
- Uh, is that Peggy Burgdorf?
- Yeah.

14:28.293 --> 14:30.488
She's being transferred
to Beth Zion for surgery.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.132
Oh, great. I told Dr. Gibson I'd help out.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.280
Do you mind if I catch
a ride with you guys?

14:33.281 --> 14:34.858
Yeah, sure.

14:38.696 --> 14:41.431
Tell me exactly what you
said to the detective.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.734
I said exactly nothing. Not a single word.

14:43.736 --> 14:47.004
He said they saw my car on some
surveillance camera and that's it.

14:47.006 --> 14:49.239
That's not it.

14:49.241 --> 14:53.977
They have a witness who says the
assailant fits your description.

14:53.979 --> 14:55.378
And what else do they have?

15:13.229 --> 15:15.097
Is this a big problem?

15:16.499 --> 15:17.733
Not necessarily.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.541
That's pretty. You should
do that with your hair.

15:27.811 --> 15:29.211
Daddy!

15:29.213 --> 15:30.646
Hey, honey!

15:31.981 --> 15:33.882
Am I coming home tonight?

15:33.884 --> 15:35.717
Not yet, sweetie.

15:35.719 --> 15:38.753
- You're gonna stay with Grandpa a little longer.
- NINA: Really?

15:38.755 --> 15:39.821
Why is that?

15:41.224 --> 15:42.224

15:44.060 --> 15:46.586
(SIGHS) Unbelievable, now she tells me.

15:46.587 --> 15:48.498
Dr. Gibson doesn't need my help anymore.

15:49.733 --> 15:52.433
Well, we're almost done here,
I can give you a ride back.

15:52.435 --> 15:55.970
Uh, I'm gonna meet a friend for a
coffee, she's on staff here, so... 

16:37.111 --> 16:39.479
- Tea?
- I would love some, thank you.

16:53.184 --> 16:54.817

16:54.819 --> 16:56.418
But I don't wanna leave.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.753
Oh, it's okay, honey. Mommy's tired.

17:03.126 --> 17:05.194
When do I get to see you again?

17:12.601 --> 17:14.569
- Okay.
- Love you.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.209
See you soon, okay?

17:31.519 --> 17:33.787
Why is Sawyer staying with my father?

17:33.789 --> 17:38.326
I'm working a big case
right now. Coming and going.

17:38.328 --> 17:39.080
I thought...

17:40.094 --> 17:42.099
I thought it would be easier
for her to be with Burton.

17:43.232 --> 17:44.674
You know, more stability.

17:45.758 --> 17:48.186
You're still chasing after
this miracle, aren't you?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.742
A solution is in sight.

17:56.944 --> 17:58.879
I'm closer than I've
ever been to saving you.

18:01.715 --> 18:03.583
I won't let go of that.

18:05.753 --> 18:10.623
I said I would do one more
round of chemo. That's it.

18:10.625 --> 18:14.927
After this, I'm going home.

18:14.929 --> 18:17.830
I want to spend my last days
with you. And with Sawyer.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.737
Please, Duncan.

18:24.739 --> 18:26.507
I don't want to die resenting you

18:26.508 --> 18:29.334
because you won't give
up on some fantasy cure.

19:24.729 --> 19:27.465
What the hell's going
on? What's he doing here?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.600
- We're going on a road trip.
- Where?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.702
Just get in and I'll explain everything.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.350
My name is Burton Delaney.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.453
I know who you are. You're a fraud.

19:49.455 --> 19:53.723
- I understand this is a difficult situation.
- Difficult?

19:53.725 --> 19:56.526
You were Ellen's lawyer.
Her father's friend.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.228
She put her faith in
you and you sold her out.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.865
- We need your help.
- Go to hell.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.768
- You can keep your mouth shut.
- Kramer, please.

20:05.770 --> 20:09.705
Kramer is a suspect in a murder
case. Your son is going to help him.

20:09.707 --> 20:13.242
What are you talking about?
We're not going to help you.

20:13.244 --> 20:17.380
As I explained to your wife, the fates
of our families are intertwined, Brian.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.848
You need to help us to help yourself.

20:33.663 --> 20:36.259
unusual comings and
goings, I found nothing.

20:36.333 --> 20:39.568
Checked the house, talked
to the neighbors, all quiet.

- You want to bring her back in for questioning?
- No.

20:45.475 --> 20:47.242
Not without some new evidence.

- All right, well, I'll keep checking.
- Okay.

- Can I help you?
- Yeah, uh...

a patient, Nina Carlisle.

Oh yes, Mrs. Carlisle was
just taken down to chemo.

there for a couple of hours.

Kramer hit him. And that was it.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.168
The money we got has
nothing to do with this.

22:24.170 --> 22:27.238
You still need to pay me what we agreed on.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.173
That mean I can count on you?

22:29.175 --> 22:31.475

23:37.337 --> 23:39.703
Okay, look, you need to go. Now.

anywhere without you.

23:41.674 --> 23:43.874
- I know what's going on.
- I'm serious.

23:43.876 --> 23:45.576
Just... get out.

23:45.578 --> 23:47.544
I can see it in your eyes.

23:47.546 --> 23:49.980
You're terrified of him.

23:49.982 --> 23:52.415
Him?

23:52.417 --> 23:54.985
- What are you talking about?
- The bruises on your arm.

23:56.087 --> 23:57.621
The lady from child services.

23:59.090 --> 24:02.258
It's your father, Morgan, he's abusing you.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.043
Okay. Your mother too.

24:04.045 --> 24:05.975
She had blood on her arm
when I came by the other day,

24:05.976 --> 24:08.531
- she's scared.
- That's not what's going on.

24:08.533 --> 24:11.167
You're lying. I can tell.

Please.

24:31.321 --> 24:32.421
Just tell me one thing.

24:35.658 --> 24:37.292
Did he make you break up with me?

24:41.131 --> 24:42.464
Yes.

24:47.970 --> 24:49.237
Do you still love me?

24:53.042 --> 24:54.375
Yes.

24:58.447 --> 25:00.015
Then I'm not leaving, Morgan.

25:40.354 --> 25:42.889
Look you don't understand,
he will kill you.

25:42.891 --> 25:44.691
I'm not afraid of him.

25:44.693 --> 25:47.260
Okay? And no one is ever
going to hurt you again.

25:50.731 --> 25:52.232
I'm taking you away.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.533
Tonight.

What's going on?

26:09.549 --> 26:11.350
Something wrong?

26:11.352 --> 26:12.684
I'm fine.

26:22.596 --> 26:24.663
This pregnancy is... 

26:26.099 --> 26:27.899
just awful.

26:50.689 --> 26:52.757
Look just... 

26:52.759 --> 26:55.793
talk about what we talked
about and you'll be fine.

26:55.795 --> 26:56.894
I got it.

27:01.933 --> 27:04.334
You didn't see him do anything.

27:04.336 --> 27:07.404
Just remember that. Okay?

27:07.406 --> 27:09.740
Dad, I can handle this,
it's a not a big deal.

27:13.278 --> 27:14.478
Jake Sanders.

27:21.952 --> 27:23.953
What's the camera for?

27:23.955 --> 27:25.656
We have to record every word you say.

27:25.658 --> 27:27.691
It's nothing to worry about.

27:27.693 --> 27:29.759
Look into the lens.

27:29.761 --> 27:31.495
State your name and age.

27:31.497 --> 27:33.963
Jake Sanders. Fifteen years old.

27:33.965 --> 27:35.231
So,

27:35.233 --> 27:37.633
tell me Jake, what were
you and Kramer Delaney

27:37.635 --> 27:40.103
doing up in Bethesda that night?

27:40.105 --> 27:41.971
Do I still look in camera?

27:41.973 --> 27:44.607
No, you can look at me.

27:44.609 --> 27:49.179
I met Kramer two years ago,
he's a friend of my dad's.

27:49.181 --> 27:51.747
He's sort of been a mentor to me.

27:51.749 --> 27:53.216
Okay, he's your mentor.

27:53.218 --> 27:56.018
Great. What were you doing that night?

27:56.020 --> 27:57.786
Uh, he took me to a skate park

27:57.788 --> 28:00.556
off of Wisconsin Avenue, near a school.

28:00.558 --> 28:02.091
Just the two of you?

28:02.093 --> 28:04.126
Yeah, he's a really good skateboarder.

28:04.128 --> 28:07.730
He was teaching me some tricks.
How to do a kick flip, you know?

28:07.732 --> 28:09.264
Hmm.

28:09.266 --> 28:10.565
How long were you there?

28:10.567 --> 28:12.601
An hour, maybe more.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.903
Then he drove me home.

28:14.905 --> 28:16.071
Where do you live?

28:16.073 --> 28:17.740
Arlington, Virginia.

28:17.742 --> 28:20.008
Arlington?

28:20.010 --> 28:22.677
Why did you drive up all the way
to Bethesda to go skateboarding?

28:22.679 --> 28:25.913
Uh, it's a really good park.

28:25.915 --> 28:27.215
Not very crowded.

28:27.217 --> 28:28.683
There are no big parks in Arlington?

28:31.487 --> 28:33.455
Are you telling me the truth, Jake?

28:38.661 --> 28:39.660
(GULPS)

29:13.894 --> 29:15.094
NINA: What are you doing?

29:17.264 --> 29:18.798
I'm Dr. Sanders.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.400
Your husband asked me to check in on you.

29:21.402 --> 29:23.135
I know exactly who you are.

29:28.074 --> 29:30.142
DETECTIVE: Look Jake.

29:30.144 --> 29:33.045
I don't want you to get in any trouble.

29:33.047 --> 29:35.146
You're a young kid.

29:35.148 --> 29:38.350
- Trouble?
- If you lie.

29:38.452 --> 29:40.251
Well you'll get in trouble.

29:40.253 --> 29:41.787
Simple as that.

29:41.789 --> 29:43.655
I'm telling the truth.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.690
Good.

29:45.692 --> 29:46.925
I was just checking.

29:59.338 --> 30:02.006
Why'd you show me that?

30:02.008 --> 30:04.608
'Cause I don't think you're
taking this seriously enough.

30:04.610 --> 30:08.011
This man had two kids and
a wife and now he's dead.

30:08.013 --> 30:10.648
His family will never see him again.

30:10.650 --> 30:12.149
Ever.

30:12.151 --> 30:13.684
Imagine that was your father.

30:17.288 --> 30:21.559
You would want me to do my best to
find out who did this horrible thing.

30:21.561 --> 30:22.560
Right?

30:26.730 --> 30:28.098
So I'm going to ask one more time.

30:31.169 --> 30:32.869
Are you telling me the truth?

30:36.507 --> 30:38.475
My husband told me all about you.

30:40.611 --> 30:41.845
He did?

30:41.847 --> 30:43.112
I know everything.

30:44.114 --> 30:45.482
Then... 

30:45.484 --> 30:47.684
Tell me why is he doing this?

30:48.819 --> 30:50.520
He thinks it's his only option.

30:51.655 --> 30:53.089
There's always other options.

30:53.091 --> 30:54.591
Particularly with something this serious.

30:54.593 --> 30:56.860
He wants to save me.

30:56.862 --> 31:00.262
And you've obviously
convinced him there's some... 

31:00.264 --> 31:04.166
experimental therapy
that can cure my leukemia.

31:04.168 --> 31:06.802
He believes in you.

31:06.804 --> 31:08.004
But I don't.

31:11.508 --> 31:14.209
If you won't leave with me, I'm gonna
walk in and talk with him myself.

31:14.211 --> 31:15.443
You can't do that.

31:16.679 --> 31:18.313
Boyd.

31:18.315 --> 31:20.448
Stop. Stop! Okay, I'll go with you.

31:20.450 --> 31:22.450
I'll go with you, okay?

31:22.452 --> 31:25.153
- Just...
- Okay.

31:25.155 --> 31:27.255
Stay here. Okay?

31:27.257 --> 31:30.291
I'm gonna go and make sure it's clear,

31:30.293 --> 31:32.994
and we'll go out the side door.

31:32.996 --> 31:34.962
Okay.

31:34.964 --> 31:36.398
Stay here.

31:50.012 --> 31:51.445
Morgan.

31:51.447 --> 31:52.479
Morgan!

31:53.882 --> 31:55.182
Where you going? Come here.

31:58.921 --> 32:01.488
I was just going to meet my friend.

32:01.490 --> 32:03.723
DUNCAN: You know the rules.

32:03.725 --> 32:06.126
You don't leave this house
without my permission.

32:06.128 --> 32:07.127
MORGAN: Sorry.

32:11.399 --> 32:12.999
What's going on with you?

32:14.869 --> 32:16.203
Morgan?

32:16.205 --> 32:17.771
Tell me.

32:17.773 --> 32:19.373
Morgan, I asked you a question.

32:20.675 --> 32:21.708
Get your hands off her!

32:25.012 --> 32:26.680
It's over.

32:26.682 --> 32:29.315
You're not going to hurt her ever again.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.892
Put the gun down, son.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.529
Now, before somebody gets hurt.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.098
No one is gonna get hurt if
you just let your daughter go.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.166
Obviously you're upset, and
I'm sure you have your reasons,

32:50.168 --> 32:53.103
but let's talk about this, I'm
sure we could figure something out.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.172
Boyd. Listen to him.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.975
Just put the gun down and do what he says.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.548
He's brainwashed you.

33:05.550 --> 33:09.018
But it's okay, you don't have
to be afraid of him anymore.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.024
C'mon Morgan.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.592
We're gonna go to the police.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.161
And we're going to tell them everything.

33:21.465 --> 33:23.198
Boyd that's not necessary.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.233
She's right. You don't want
to get the police involved.

33:25.235 --> 33:27.202
For your own sake, you just
broke into somebody's house

33:27.204 --> 33:28.871
with a loaded gun.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.039
That's a felony.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.775
I did it to protect
Morgan. That's not a crime.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.644
I understand. You mean well.

33:35.646 --> 33:38.681
And you love her. That's why I'm
willing to put this all behind us.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.683
I won't press charges, and we
can keep the police out of it.

33:44.253 --> 33:46.188
But I need you to put that gun down.

33:48.090 --> 33:50.024
Now.

33:50.026 --> 33:55.197
Boyd, put the gun down.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.865
And I will explain everything.

He's not going to say anything.

34:42.878 --> 34:44.510

Hi.

35:57.850 --> 35:59.649
I wanna check on a friend of
mine who's in surgery today.

35:59.651 --> 36:02.052
Neil Cornfeld.

36:02.054 --> 36:03.753
He was medevac'd to Baltimore this morning.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.891
Yes, the surgery ended several hours ago.

36:09.327 --> 36:12.062
I spoke to one of his
doctors earlier today.

36:12.064 --> 36:15.031
Ellen... Sanders.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.399
Is she back yet?

36:19.804 --> 36:22.806
Dr. Sanders didn't go to Baltimore.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.907
Oh, maybe I misunderstood.

36:24.909 --> 36:26.242
Do you know where she is?

36:27.277 --> 36:29.879
Nina, is it okay if I call you Nina?

36:29.881 --> 36:31.848
What did you tell him?

36:31.850 --> 36:34.650
To make him actually believe
you could cure my leukemia.

36:36.186 --> 36:39.155
Well, I told him about... 

36:39.157 --> 36:41.423

36:41.425 --> 36:43.492
The harvesting, the success rate.

Your husband loves you.

36:46.464 --> 36:49.832
He's willing to try anything.

36:49.834 --> 36:51.900
How much are you charging him for this?

36:53.670 --> 36:55.838
'Cause our insurance won't cover anything.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.006
Well it isn't about money.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.675
It's about trying to find a cure.
