WEBVTT

00:03.712 --> 00:05.505
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

00:05.798 --> 00:07.465
You got any cases?

00:07.591 --> 00:11.260
Three. Got a teenage
African American lung transplant...

00:11.387 --> 00:14.472
Next two days you'll be doing
nothing but clinic work.

00:14.598 --> 00:15.556
I just said...

00:15.683 --> 00:16.516
You were lying.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.351
Well, then why'd you ask?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.727
Because if you told the truth

00:19.853 --> 00:22.146
I was only gonna give you
one day of clinic duty.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.524
That's dishonest.
I refuse to participate in this...

00:24.650 --> 00:26.025
You'll do it. You owe me.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.945
I kept you out of jail.
I can put you back.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.367
Perjurer.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.910
Felon.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.457
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.001
I told the nurse
I have a runny nose.

00:44.128 --> 00:45.336
But I don't.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.589
I think I have
syphilis or gonorrhea.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.218
I think I have an STD.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.641
I think I have a...

01:11.363 --> 01:14.407
Who is here for a runny nose?

01:15.033 --> 01:18.870
It's a cold!
It'll get better. Go home.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.582
Those of you who stayed
obviously do not have colds.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.876
You will be
assigned to a doctor who is not me,

01:25.002 --> 01:26.961
because I am tired
of wiping crotches.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.422
House. You're doing this.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.969
- It hurts!
- Sir...

01:39.725 --> 01:41.559
Call security.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.439
Should I get a sedative?

01:46.565 --> 01:47.940
No, I'm good. Thanks.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.906
It hurts! My head hurts!

02:09.254 --> 02:10.087
Need a team here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.256
- I have the sedative.
- Little late.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.341
Just in time.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.884
What did you give him?
A paralytic.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.302
Why would you do that?

02:16.428 --> 02:17.678
Somebody had to
stop the screaming.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.388
Then he's still in pain.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.057
Yeah. But quietly.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.975
Paralytic's
stopped him breathing.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.728
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.028
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates

02:34.154 --> 02:36.656
or I can figure out
if this guy's delirium, pain

02:36.782 --> 02:39.242
and insanely high heart rate
are life-threatening

02:39.785 --> 02:41.494
or just a personality quirk.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.165
I think the latter choice is the better
for all three of us.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.908
He's sedated.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.994
It took five CCs
of haloperidol

03:23.120 --> 03:25.037
to get him down after
the paralytic wore off.

03:25.163 --> 03:29.709
So, pain in his right ear,
psychotic behavior and dizziness. Go.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.295
Nurses said he was
holding his head.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.297
How do you know
it was specifically his ear?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.423
Because he was dizzy.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.383
Means the problem was
affecting his inner ear.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.718
Nurses said he was
running in circles.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.094
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.387
He wasn't running in circles.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.388
He was running in oblongs.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.473
Looked like a three-year-old kid
drew them.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.727
Acoustic neuroma that started
a hemorrhage.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.272
Explains the pain,
vertigo, everything.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.024
Get an MRI.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.358
What else?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.360
If it explains everything...

03:56.486 --> 03:57.403
Might not explain everything.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.697
Well, what if he
was psychotic first,

03:59.823 --> 04:01.365
then self-mutilated,
damaged the ear.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.159
Excellent.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.202
We need a complete
psychiatric work up.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.787
Your turn.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.832
I was gonna say
what Foreman...

04:09.958 --> 04:11.208
Say something else.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.546
He came to the clinic.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.506
Good.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.216
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

04:19.343 --> 04:21.385
especially given
the rapid heart rate.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.930
Lingering ear infection,
pressure builds up in his inner ear,

04:24.056 --> 04:26.432
bursts through the mastoid bone
while he's waiting in the clinic.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.850
Oh, yes!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.477
Get a head CT.
Draw blood cultures.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.438
Run a chem panel and get
a complete blood count.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.316
Oh, while you're at it,
pour some alcohol into his ear

04:35.442 --> 04:37.318
and take out the cockroach.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.154
He has
a cockroach in his ear?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.489
He was scratching
that ear

04:41.615 --> 04:43.240
right before the event,
so I took a peek.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.243
My guess is it
started biting.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.579
Nothing else wrong with him?

04:48.705 --> 04:51.374
Isn't that enough?
It's pretty gross.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.834
So why are we
doing the tests?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.087
Well, it's either that or
I have to keep doing clinic duty.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.339
You can do the tests
or just stay out of Cuddy's sight.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.091
I don't really care which.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.064
Why are you here?

05:15.691 --> 05:18.401
Because it's not a hospital.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.486
It's a jogging park.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.863
You're not jogging.
You can't jog.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.949
I'm watching jogging.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.995
I sit and I watch
and I imagine.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.294
So what do you watch for?

05:39.756 --> 05:42.675
That guy's running in shorts.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.137
He's not running.
He's trolling.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.472
You're good at this.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.351
How long are you
going to stay here?

05:53.770 --> 05:57.481
Beauty of this place is that it's
the last place Cuddy will look.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.615
How can I help you?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.202
The doctors gave me this.

06:10.662 --> 06:11.912
What doctors?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.749
At the other hospital.
Last month.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.049
Do you know what this says?

06:23.675 --> 06:24.884
Yes.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.929
"Patient has a six-centimeter
mass in the right lung.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.140
Cancerous. Inoperable."

06:31.933 --> 06:34.143
Do you understand
what this means?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.939
Is it okay if I
sleep here tonight?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.027
It's cold outside.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.912
What are you doing here?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.705
I thought House had a case.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.292
He doesn't.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.884
You ordered a CT on a patient
with a bug in his ear.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.135
How did you know I was here?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.762
I ran into Cameron
in the clinic.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.514
"Ran into"?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.307
You ordered
pointless tests just to...

07:13.433 --> 07:16.435
Wouldn't have been pointless
if you hadn't "run into" Cameron.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.645
She got punished.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.105
She's stuck with
another dying patient.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.648
Is that Vicodin?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.858
Breath mint. Thought you
were gonna kiss me.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.360
What happened to rehab?

07:24.486 --> 07:25.444
I got out.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.032
It was a scam?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.909
Enough foreplay. Are you
going to kiss me or not?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.620
You are going back to
the clinic. Or jail.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.622
You perjured yourself
to keep me out of jail.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.915
How are you going to tell...

07:38.041 --> 07:41.460
I only did that because
I thought you were getting clean.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.380
So it's, "Do clinic duty
or go to jail"?

07:44.506 --> 07:45.548
Yes.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.134
Then it'll be, "Finish your paperwork
or go to jail."

07:48.260 --> 07:49.802
"Help with
fundraising or go to jail."

07:49.928 --> 07:52.346
"Do your job or go to jail."

07:52.472 --> 07:54.348
I think I'd rather go to jail.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.852
You owe me.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.947
Beautiful.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.408
Thank you. It's dry.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.578
Who cares? It's beautiful.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.205
If my lawn were half
as well-maintained as that,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.833
pigeons wouldn't have
the nerve to poop on it.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.960
Good grooming is important.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.045
Was that a shot?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.131
People do judge you
on your appearance.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.550
When you entered,
I noted your shirt hadn't been pressed.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.552
You hadn't shaved
in quite some time.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.637
I extrapolated you
are a person for whom

08:33.763 --> 08:35.514
detail was not
a major concern.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.683
I was worried you might apply
that same standard in your...

08:37.809 --> 08:40.019
Do you use toenail
clippers up there?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.562
They're longer
so they allow me

08:41.688 --> 08:43.022
to better reach
the upper hairs.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.066
I'm wearing a rumpled shirt
and forgot to brush my hair this week.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.235
You've got
athlete's foot in your nose.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.282
I'm ready to be judged.

08:54.451 --> 08:58.370
Okay.
50 dollars to any patient

08:59.039 --> 09:01.582
who's willing to
leave here right now.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.125
Sounds good to me.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.085
House. You can't...

09:05.212 --> 09:06.253
My money.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.130
I don't care.
People do not...

09:08.256 --> 09:11.383
If they'll leave for 50 bucks,
they're not all that sick.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.427
Or they're poor
and desperate,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.054
which is why
this place is here.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.056
If they're that poor,
then they'd rather have 50 bucks than...

09:18.391 --> 09:21.894
- Can I have the money?
- Look. It's monogrammed!

09:22.020 --> 09:24.063
He doesn't need money.
Ergo, he's not sick.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.648
And the blood?

09:25.774 --> 09:26.857
Could be anybody's.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.609
Monogram's definitely his.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.196
We need to talk.

09:34.199 --> 09:38.494
Doesn't matter what you say, do or
threaten, I will find a way out.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.038
How can we make this
more interesting for you?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.498
How can we make
the sky green?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.124
How can we make
the tall short?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.710
You cannot make
the uninteresting interesting.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.380
I'll pay you 10 dollars
for every patient

09:49.506 --> 09:51.340
you diagnose
without touching.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.636
You pay me 10 dollars
for every one you have to touch.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.931
You're making this
into a game for me.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.475
From which I can only conclude this
isn't a game for you.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.726
No.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.981
Why? You think if I deal with enough
people I'll find some humanity?

10:08.483 --> 10:09.566
Yes.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.197
Why do I have to
do this myself?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.242
I got a bum leg. Say, "Ah."

10:18.368 --> 10:19.326
Ah.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.454
Feels rough.

10:22.580 --> 10:27.126
Yes. It's a rash.
I'm gonna need more than "rough."

10:27.252 --> 10:31.297
Well, it... It's just rough.
Can't you feel it?

10:31.881 --> 10:32.965
Well, I could.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.718
But then what
satisfaction would you get?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.264
Got it!

10:40.390 --> 10:42.558
Start counting.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.311
How many?

10:45.437 --> 10:46.603
Twenty-six.

10:49.357 --> 10:54.236
Okay. Either you suck at math
or you're gonna die in two seconds.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.699
You suck at math.

10:59.617 --> 11:04.413
Diagnosis. Prescription.
You owe me 30.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.474
I owe you 10.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.393
Test results are back
for your STD patients.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.978
I'm not paying you for them.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.730
You already touched them.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.026
How old are you?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.235
30.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.489
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

11:38.656 --> 11:39.656
Dawson's Creek?

11:39.991 --> 11:42.534
How do you get to 30
and not know about condoms?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.578
Oh, God. I have an STD.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.413
No. But you will.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.500
Every patient who comes
in here for an STD test

11:49.626 --> 11:50.918
has one thing in common.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.255
They had SWS,
"sex while stupid."

11:55.382 --> 11:56.840
How old are you?

11:57.759 --> 11:58.884
Sixty.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.888
You're lying,
but that's not the point.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.224
Have you never seen
Dawson's Creek?

12:06.017 --> 12:08.977
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

12:09.187 --> 12:12.106
How do you live to your age
and not know about condoms?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.565
I have an STD?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.111
Yeah. You're actually
the first one today.

12:17.237 --> 12:22.116
Lucky day. Well, not for you, but you
gotta feel good for everyone else.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.248
It's chlamydia.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.166
As bad news goes,
it's about the best.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.506
Oh, settle down.
It's treatable.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.258
It's actually curable.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.140
All you gotta do is
take these pills...

12:46.266 --> 12:47.391
Don't touch me!

12:53.648 --> 12:54.898
Oh, God.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.574
I need someone to
cover a patient.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.950
House, you committed to...

13:05.076 --> 13:06.368
She was raped.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.626
You think I'm
the right doctor for her?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.966
We've assigned
another doctor to your care.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.177
I didn't mean to
upset Dr. House.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.345
He knows that.
That's not why we're doing this.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.431
I'd like to keep
being treated by him.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.390
Why?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.100
Just do.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.644
Trust me. It's better if you
deal with somebody who specializes...

13:32.770 --> 13:34.104
I'm fine.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.316
You told Dr. House
it's been less than a week.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.610
You haven't told
anyone other than him.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.861
Emotionally you're still...

13:40.987 --> 13:43.071
You know what
I'm dealing with?

13:43.198 --> 13:45.157
You know what
I'm going through?

13:46.659 --> 13:47.701
No.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.787
You think Dr. House does?

13:53.249 --> 13:56.001
I'm not suggesting either one
of us be your doctor.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.669
Dr. Stone is a psychiatrist.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.130
If Dr. House is too busy,
I could wait.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.351
Why do you want me?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.230
I don't know.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.775
I don't want to treat you.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.903
You're just saying that
so I'll see the psychiatrist.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.322
True.
Except for the word "just."

14:26.032 --> 14:27.366
I'm saying I don't
want to treat you

14:27.492 --> 14:28.700
so you'll see
the psychiatrist

14:28.826 --> 14:31.328
and because I don't
want to treat you.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.457
Why don't you want
to treat me anymore?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.543
I never wanted to treat you.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.628
The fact that you were raped

14:42.674 --> 14:44.883
holds no interest for me.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.260
It's nothing personal.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.514
There's nothing to treat.
You're physically healthy.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.600
Okay.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.856
But I want you
to be my doctor.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.235
Why?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.529
I don't know.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.740
You gotta have a reason.
Everything has a reason.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.204
I trust you.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.164
Ah, you see?
That's a bad reason.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.333
'Cause I'll lie to you.

15:18.501 --> 15:19.960
I'll tell you anything just
to get you out of here.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.964
I don't care.
I want to talk to you.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.884
Look, you were raped.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.970
All control was
taken from you.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.555
You're trying to
find that control again.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.974
You want me
because I don't want you.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.186
I'm raping you?

15:39.647 --> 15:43.025
In a very non-invasive,
more annoying than traumatic...

15:43.151 --> 15:45.569
Get the hell out of here!

15:45.945 --> 15:48.030
I'll send in Dr. Stone.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.620
I didn't consent to
all of this medicine.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.413
You've been out
on the streets. No treatment...

15:56.539 --> 15:59.333
I'm dying. There is
no treatment for dying.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.126
We can make you comfortable.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.463
Don't want to be.
Why not?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.590
Because I screwed up my life.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.760
So you want to punish yourself
for messing up your life?

16:11.512 --> 16:15.432
Please, stop the treatment.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.981
It'll go away on its own.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.524
It's not. Can't you...

16:24.651 --> 16:26.068
Nope. It'll go away.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.235
It's been all day.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.570
There must be
some treatment you...

16:28.696 --> 16:30.238
Nope. It'll go away.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.116
Or it won't go away.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.035
I read about a treatment.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.037
Some doctor won
a prize for it.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.499
I read about it.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.920
You don't have the hiccups,
do you?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.385
Make a note,
"Drug-seeking behavior."

16:52.011 --> 16:55.889
- Morphine?
- No. Anal digital stimulation.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.561
How long has Stone
been in with her?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.105
Are you concerned?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.649
You know how many people get
raped every day?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.275
So it's common,
therefore boring?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.986
If we were to care about every person
suffering on the planet,

17:10.113 --> 17:11.071
life would shut down.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.781
How about just
the ones we meet?

17:12.907 --> 17:14.908
They deserve our sympathy
more than the other people?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.911
So your solution is not to give
a damn about any of them.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.997
How do you do that?
How do you take that theory

17:21.124 --> 17:22.916
and put it in practice?
You met her...

17:23.042 --> 17:26.461
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!

17:27.213 --> 17:32.259
Hey! I paid these people
50 bucks to leave here an hour ago.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.385
Yeah, we came back.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.011
Then you owe me 50.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.388
The kid needs surgery.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.890
And he could
walk way back then.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.600
Stand up, kid.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.979
He swallowed a magnet.
We got to cut it out.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.564
- How old are you?
- Eight.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.942
And he swallowed
something stuck to a fridge.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.527
Darwin says, "Let him die."

17:50.653 --> 17:53.363
If it's already below the stomach,
it should pass on its own.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.364
Strong magnet.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.824
It's messing
with the imaging.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.493
We have no way to...

17:59.287 --> 18:01.413
You got x-ray vision, House?

18:06.294 --> 18:09.421
Whoa, whoa! You're gonna
cut him open? Right here?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.725
It's well into the intestines.
He's fine.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.853
I want my 50 back.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.688
I need a crash cart!
Stat!

18:36.908 --> 18:37.949
What happened?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.076
Pills. Benzos. We need to get
her stomach pumped.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.953
- Respiration's shallow.
- What did you say to her?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.163
Nothing that would
make her want to...

18:43.289 --> 18:44.122
Heartbeat's irregular.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.457
- What did she say to you?
- Nothing.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.167
I gave her a couple of sedatives,
turned around,

18:47.293 --> 18:49.294
- and she grabbed the whole bottle.
- You must have said something.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.588
I said plenty.
She said nothing.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.089
I was with her
for over an hour.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.050
She didn't say one word.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.247
You gonna do that again?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.546
You're gonna be okay.
Physically.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.758
Which is all
that interests you.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.514
But you're here.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.140
Under orders.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.561
Why would you tell me that?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.729
'Cause I don't
like hypocrisy.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.399
But you don't have
a problem with cruelty?

19:55.403 --> 19:58.905
Which brings us back to,
why do you want me?

19:59.991 --> 20:00.949
I don't know.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.161
You tried to kill yourself
because you couldn't talk to me.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.121
You must have a reason.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.039
Why does there always
have to be a reason?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.916
Can't we just talk?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.002
There's a phone.
Talk to a friend,

20:12.295 --> 20:14.296
a family member.
Call the police.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.221
You want to talk about
what happened to you?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.472
No.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.560
You want to talk
about your STD meds?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.186
No.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.356
You don't really
seem to want to talk.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.649
No, I do.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.610
About what?

20:38.195 --> 20:40.655
I don't know. Anything.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.617
The weather?

20:45.995 --> 20:49.080
You were raped and
you want to talk about the weather?

20:50.583 --> 20:51.708
Yeah.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.713
I'm not gonna talk to
you about the weather.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.055
- You help her.
- She wants you.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.014
God knows why.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.807
She doesn't know
what she wants.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.727
She knows she wants you. You were the
first person she spoke to about this.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.896
The fact that I
was in the wrong place at the wrong time

21:13.022 --> 21:14.898
should be trumped by the fact
that I'm useless at this.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.566
No, you're not.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.235
You romantically
wanting to believe that

21:19.362 --> 21:21.237
is never going
to make it true.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.115
I'm agreeing with you.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.369
You're the last person
she should be talking to.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.288
If she wants to talk about the weather,
talk about the weather.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.208
She wants normalcy. She wants to feel
like the world didn't end.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.336
Right. I'll tell her
that everything went on without her.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.838
Babies were born,
people got married,

21:38.965 --> 21:41.132
thousands of people
will remember the day she got raped

21:41.258 --> 21:42.300
as the happiest
day of their lives.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.552
You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.388
You need to get her to
talk about what happened.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.347
No, he doesn't.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.306
Pretending it didn't happen...

21:48.432 --> 21:49.724
Wrong.
Pretending this didn't happen

21:49.850 --> 21:51.184
is the best thing
she could possibly do.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.519
She's got to make this real.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.188
You know what we should
be trying to make real or process?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.857
The few decent
moments in our lives. Not the crap.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.526
Maybe you're right.
Except there's no way

21:59.652 --> 22:01.403
she can pretend
this didn't happen.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.114
So she has no choice
but to process it.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.119
You've got to tell me
what happened.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.621
You don't
really want to hear.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.039
Sure I do.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.000
You're lying.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.005
This doesn't have
to destroy your life.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.631
I know.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.466
It doesn't mean
anything about you.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.468
It wasn't your fault.

22:25.636 --> 22:26.845
I know.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.471
You did nothing wrong.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.306
Some jerk hurt you.
That's all.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.558
I know.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.394
You're worried that you can
never trust men again.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.353
No.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.439
Statistically, there was always a chance
this could happen.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.066
The fact that it did happen
doesn't change anything.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.902
The world doesn't suck any more today
than it did yesterday.

22:43.029 --> 22:43.862
I know all that.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.655
Well, then what do
you want me to tell you?

22:45.781 --> 22:49.075
Nothing. I just want to talk.

22:49.452 --> 22:53.329
About nothing. If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.415
It might.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.833
How?

22:56.959 --> 22:58.251
Time.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.589
Time changes everything.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.925
That's what people say.
It's not true.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.261
Doing things changes things.

23:08.679 --> 23:12.807
Not doing things leaves things
exactly as they were.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.191
Why do you have to suffer?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.027
I gave my word.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.613
Who would make
you promise that?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.198
My father.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.869
He said I would die
alone and miserable.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.079
That's not a promise.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.955
And even if it was,
he's dead.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.208
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care if...

23:38.334 --> 23:40.835
Why did your husband
have to suffer?

23:41.087 --> 23:45.006
- How do you know about my husband?
- Well, I just know.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.013
You have to die in pain

23:52.139 --> 23:54.766
because of a promise
you made to your father?

23:54.892 --> 24:00.063
If I say "yes," you'll use that
as proof that I'm insane.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.316
Force treatment on me.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.611
Did the nurse tell you
about my husband?

24:06.821 --> 24:08.238
No.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.535
- Nurse!
- Yes.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.288
It's under control.

24:22.503 --> 24:26.714
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to freak you out.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.133
Why?

24:28.259 --> 24:30.385
Because I need you
to remember me.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.012
I need somebody
to remember me.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.103
Where did you go to college?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.313
Northwestern. You?

24:42.982 --> 24:45.608
Hopkins. What was your major?

24:46.068 --> 24:47.277
Comparative religion.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.486
Why do you trust me?

24:48.612 --> 24:50.113
I don't know.
Can't we just...

24:50.239 --> 24:51.239
That's not rational.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.448
Nothing's rational.

24:52.575 --> 24:53.616
Everything is rational!

24:53.742 --> 24:55.326
I was raped.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.620
Explain how that
makes sense to you.

25:00.666 --> 25:05.086
We are selfish, base animals
crawling across the earth,

25:05.212 --> 25:08.173
and because we've got brains,
if we try real hard,

25:08.299 --> 25:12.093
we can occasionally aspire to something
that is less than pure evil.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.269
Has anything terrible
ever happened to you?

25:24.565 --> 25:26.524
What do you want me to say?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.652
You wanted this conversation.

25:30.237 --> 25:34.157
You wanted to talk about
something that matters. Talk.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.290
She's waiting
for your answer?

25:42.416 --> 25:43.833
She's asleep.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.711
I sedated her.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.006
Why do you care
what you say to her?

25:50.132 --> 25:53.009
Because I don't know how to
answer these questions.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.720
It's a simple question.
"Has your life sucked?"

25:55.846 --> 25:58.306
Tell her the truth.
Tell her you were shot. Tell her...

25:58.432 --> 25:59.891
She doesn't want
to hear the truth.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.351
She's looking for something.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.602
Looking to
extrapolate some...

26:02.728 --> 26:04.103
She's looking to
connect with you.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.607
And that's what's scaring the hell
out of you. Tell her the truth.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.067
There is no truth.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.862
Are we role-playing?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.239
Am I you?
I don't want to be you.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.199
She's not asking
for test results.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.368
She's not asking what
two plus two equals.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.328
She's asking for my
personal life experience

26:20.454 --> 26:22.455
so she can extrapolate
to all humanity.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.166
That's not truth.
It's bad science.

26:26.252 --> 26:30.463
It's not science at all.
Tell her the truth.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.842
Tell her your life
has been good.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.177
It hasn't been.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.221
Tell her anyway.
She wants hope.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.516
She wants to know that
what happened to her wasn't the norm.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.017
That things can be okay,

26:43.143 --> 26:45.728
which means maybe they can be
okay for her again.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.983
Tell her your life sucked.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.359
It didn't.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.694
Tell her anyway.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.237
She wants to know
she's not alone.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.030
She wants to know
she's gonna survive this.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.699
That other people
have been through this

26:57.825 --> 26:59.325
and worse and come
out the other end.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.536
She wants to know if
she's going to heal.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.997
Act like you've healed.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.792
Tell her...

27:10.921 --> 27:12.422
Keep her asleep.

27:13.674 --> 27:17.343
Thanks. You all
have been a huge help.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.054
There's no wrong answer.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.473
Because there's
no right answer.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.475
Wrong.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.686
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

27:32.943 --> 27:33.985
Wake up.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.495
It's not as bad as
what happened to you.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.414
I don't think.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.249
I don't know what
happened to you.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.751
But given how lousy
you're responding,

27:49.877 --> 27:53.504
I assume it was worse than
getting abused by your grandmother.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.760
What did she do to you?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.263
Parents traveled a lot.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.265
They'd leave me with her.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.477
She liked things
the way she liked them.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.645
And she believed
in discipline.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.022
She was right, I suppose,

28:11.148 --> 28:14.150
because I hardly ever
screwed up when she was around.

28:14.276 --> 28:18.279
Too scared of getting forced
to sleep in the yard

28:18.405 --> 28:19.739
or take a bath in ice.

28:24.870 --> 28:25.995
Your turn.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.376
Your parents,
they never stopped her?

28:32.503 --> 28:34.003
I never told them.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.713
Why not?

28:36.423 --> 28:37.507
Usual reasons.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.258
I was afraid they
wouldn't believe me.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.345
I was afraid they'd think
I'd done something wrong.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.768
I opened up to you.
You open up to me.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.770
What did you call her?

28:50.896 --> 28:51.938
Oma.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.856
And you kept calling
her that after this?

28:54.024 --> 28:57.068
Dutch for "grandmother."
She was still my grandmother.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.028
And she was still Dutch.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.661
Is any part of
that story true?

29:07.788 --> 29:09.122
All of it.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.249
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.334
Something would
have to change.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.293
You don't know me.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.712
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma!

29:16.839 --> 29:19.590
- Look, you're over-reacting...
- Do not dismiss me.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.550
I'm not dismissing you.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.385
I'm saying you're
not acting rationally.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.303
I'm angry because
you are lying to me!

29:24.471 --> 29:26.139
- No, you are...
- What can I do?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.141
What the hell can I do
that you're not gonna dismiss

29:28.350 --> 29:30.810
as just being
because I was raped?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.023
Nothing.

29:39.570 --> 29:43.030
Your story, is it true?

29:45.159 --> 29:46.951
True for somebody.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.537
But not for you.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.205
These things happen.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.124
It happened to somebody.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.876
What do you care
if it happened to me?

29:55.002 --> 29:57.712
- They're not in this room.
- No, they're out there!

29:57.838 --> 30:00.047
Doctors, lawyers,
postal workers.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.258
Some of them doing great,
some of them doing lousy.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.051
You gonna base
your whole life

30:04.261 --> 30:05.761
on who you got
stuck in a room with?

30:05.888 --> 30:09.390
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck in a room with.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.478
It's what life is.
It's a series of rooms.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.814
And who we get stuck
in those rooms with

30:16.940 --> 30:19.025
adds up to what
our lives are.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.617
House?

30:42.049 --> 30:43.674
You gotta get me out of this.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.384
There's nothing to diagnose.
There's nothing...

30:45.511 --> 30:47.470
You only tested her for STDs?

30:47.888 --> 30:50.306
I had seven morons
who forgot their raincoats.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.975
It's all they asked for
so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?

30:53.101 --> 30:55.895
I wasted their time.
She's pregnant.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.203
Do you understand?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.583
Are you okay?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.628
I mean,
I know you're not okay.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.047
But are you more
or less not okay

31:23.173 --> 31:24.799
than you were
five minutes ago?

31:26.093 --> 31:27.552
About the same.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.179
Good.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.598
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant...

31:32.724 --> 31:34.600
I don't want to terminate.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.186
You want to keep the baby?

31:37.688 --> 31:39.272
Abortion is murder.

31:41.775 --> 31:46.237
True. It's a life.
And you should end it.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.490
Every life is sacred.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.911
Talk to me. Don't
quote me bumper stickers.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.454
- It's true.
- It's meaningless.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.248
It means every life
matters to God.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.208
Not to me, not to you.

31:59.501 --> 32:02.336
And judging by the number
of natural disasters, not to God either.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.588
You're just
being argumentative.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.131
Yeah. I do do that.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.383
What about Hitler?

32:07.509 --> 32:08.467
Was his life sacred to God?

32:09.219 --> 32:10.636
The father of your child?

32:10.762 --> 32:11.846
Is his life sacred to you?

32:11.972 --> 32:13.723
My child isn't Hitler.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.558
Either every life
is sacred or...

32:15.684 --> 32:18.686
Stop it! I don't want to
chat about philosophy!

32:18.979 --> 32:22.231
You're not killing your rape baby
because of a philosophy.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.485
It's murder.
I'm against it. You for it?

32:28.196 --> 32:29.405
Not as a general rule.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.740
Just for unborn children?

32:30.866 --> 32:31.991
Yes.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.665
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.044
It might make sense to kill the ass
that did this to you,

32:43.170 --> 32:44.837
but then where do
we draw the line?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.881
Which asses do
we get to kill?

32:47.007 --> 32:48.924
Which asses get to
keep on being asses?

32:49.259 --> 32:50.968
The nice thing about
the abortion debate

32:51.094 --> 32:52.803
is we can
quibble over trimesters

32:52.929 --> 32:57.767
but ultimately there's
a nice clean line, birth.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.520
Morally there's not
a lot of difference.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.356
Practically, huge.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.401
You're enjoying
this conversation.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.114
It's just the type of
conversation I do well.

33:14.451 --> 33:15.743
But the other type?

33:19.164 --> 33:20.790
The personal stuff?

33:23.418 --> 33:25.419
There are no answers.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.756
And if there are no answers,
why talk about it?

33:32.719 --> 33:36.430
You're healthy.
You shouldn't be here.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.227
I don't want to go.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.274
Fine. I won't discharge you.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.700
Wanna go for a walk?

34:02.666 --> 34:04.792
It's the last of my journey.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.628
You don't deserve pain.
You're just an insane old man.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.505
- No.
- I am not going to watch you suffer.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.048
I need you to remember me.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.426
- I'll remember you!
- Why?

34:13.593 --> 34:14.885
Because you're a nice man.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.972
You don't know that.
You don't know anything about me.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.724
Either you were a nice man
or you were an ass.

34:19.850 --> 34:23.436
Either way you did something to somebody
that they're going to remember.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.855
I have no family.
I have no friends.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.399
I didn't even
have a real job.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.568
If I die in peace,

34:30.694 --> 34:32.445
then I'm just
another patient.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.988
But if I die suffering...

34:34.114 --> 34:37.491
It'll be horrible. Don't
do that to either of us.

34:37.617 --> 34:42.538
No. I just need to
die knowing that something is different

34:42.706 --> 34:44.623
because I was here.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.208
Life goes on.

35:28.668 --> 35:31.462
Is that the reason
why we're out here?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.714
Know why I come here?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.675
I sit. I watch. I imagine.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.305
Sounds nice.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.433
I imagine that one of
them will break a leg.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.604
Just one false step,
one crack in the sidewalk...

35:49.898 --> 35:51.148
You don't really.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.483
I'm evil.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.152
Evil people don't
say they're evil.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.655
That sounds like
an easy loophole.

36:00.659 --> 36:04.453
People can do good things,
but their instincts are not good.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.624
Either God doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.545
I don't believe that.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.630
What do you believe?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.007
Why do you
think this happened?

36:19.553 --> 36:21.011
I don't want to
talk about it.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.806
Me neither. Too bad.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.770
You know, I don't think
there was a reason.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.565
So God does exist,
lets you get raped,

36:32.691 --> 36:35.609
needs you to keep
your rape baby for no reason.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.322
Maybe he was challenging me.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.616
He hurts you to help you.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.620
Well, I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.747
You're trying to convince me
there's no God.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.249
Why would you even say
something like that?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.709
Because you're
throwing your life away.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.377
I'm doing what I believe!

36:53.503 --> 36:55.796
What you believe
doesn't make sense.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.757
This is not helping me.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.718
Then I can't help you.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.515
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.351
The same way that
a bug is irrelevant

37:09.477 --> 37:11.312
in comparison
to the universe.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.860
If you don't
believe in eternity,

37:17.986 --> 37:19.862
then what you do here
is irrelevant.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.698
Your actions here
are all that matters.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.074
Then nothing matters.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.993
There's no
ultimate consequences.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.164
I couldn't live like that.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.376
So, you need to think
that the guy

37:34.502 --> 37:36.879
who did this to you is
going to be punished?

37:37.839 --> 37:40.549
I need to know that
it all means something.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.470
I need that comfort.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.723
Yeah.
Are you feeling comfortable?

37:49.392 --> 37:52.144
You feeling good right now?
You feel warm inside?

38:01.696 --> 38:06.784
I was raped.
What's your excuse?

39:04.175 --> 39:07.469
Do you think the guy who did
this to me feels bad?

39:08.513 --> 39:11.890
Would that help you?
Make you feel better?

39:13.143 --> 39:15.561
Why do you always do that?

39:15.729 --> 39:18.939
Ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just answering the question?

39:19.065 --> 39:21.066
The answer
doesn't interest me.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.402
I don't care
what he's feeling.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.030
I'm interested in
what you're feeling.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.867
You are?

39:33.955 --> 39:36.957
I'm trapped in
the room with you, right?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.753
Why did you choose me?

39:45.133 --> 39:47.384
There's something about you.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.389
It's like you're hurt, too.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.488
It was true.

40:10.492 --> 40:11.575
What was?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.913
It wasn't my grandmother.
But it was true.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.543
Who was it?

40:25.048 --> 40:26.673
It was my dad.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.028
I'd like to tell you
what happened to me now.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.701
I'd like to hear it.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.170
It was my friend's
birthday party...

41:55.763 --> 41:58.932
She terminated.
She's been discharged.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.687
She's going to be okay.

42:03.813 --> 42:05.898
Yeah. It's that simple.

42:08.151 --> 42:10.527
She's talking
about what happened.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.821
That's huge. You did good.

42:13.656 --> 42:17.367
And everyone'll tell you
that's what we gotta make her do.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.662
We got to help her, right?
Except we can't.

42:21.789 --> 42:26.835
We drag out her story,
tell each other that it'll help her heal

42:28.755 --> 42:31.089
and feel real good
about ourselves.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.802
Maybe all we've done
is make a girl cry.

42:37.305 --> 42:38.555
Then why did you...

42:43.019 --> 42:44.770
Because I don't know.

42:54.197 --> 42:56.365
You gonna follow up with her?

42:58.576 --> 43:01.453
One day, one room.
