00:02.536 --> 00:03.637
Bye.
Bye.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.173
CHRIS ROCK:
When you're a kid,

00:05.206 --> 00:06.607
one of the most important
lessons you learn

00:06.640 --> 00:09.210
is when your parents tell you
to do something...

00:09.243 --> 00:10.678
Y'all better eat that liver.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.813
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.383
...you do it...

00:17.285 --> 00:18.652
...no matter what you think...

00:18.686 --> 00:20.554
Boy, get your feet
off my good chair.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.556
Yes, ma'am.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.294
...no matter what it is.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.728
Girl, are you crazy?!

00:27.761 --> 00:30.164
You want to cook your
brother, do it outside.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.565
Yes, ma'am.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.272
No matter how you feel.

00:38.306 --> 00:43.177
Chris, clear off the table
and do the dishes.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.781
No.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.484
(tires screeching,
crashing sounds)

00:53.521 --> 00:55.389
What?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.558
Will I say what I said again?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.160
Will my mother kill me

00:59.193 --> 01:01.095
before I get a chance
to say it?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.697
Are Drew and Tonya gonna sit
there and just let this happen?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.566
Don't touch that dial.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.314
* Aw, make if funky now.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.402
After saying no to my mother
for the first time,

01:41.435 --> 01:42.603
I didn't know what to expect.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.138
What did you say?

01:44.172 --> 01:46.207
I said no.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.341
Twice.

01:47.375 --> 01:51.312
That's what I thought you said.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.591
Now say it again.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.360
Mom, I didn't eat all the dinner
by myself.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.596
I shouldn't have to clean it
all up by myself.

02:08.629 --> 02:12.433
I don't wear all the clothes,
but I wash them by myself.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.435
I don't sleep
in all the beds
in this house,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.570
but I make them up by myself.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.507
I don't pee
in all of the toilets

02:19.540 --> 02:21.209
in this house
by myself...!

02:21.242 --> 02:22.510
Mom, Drew and Tonya
sitting right there

02:22.543 --> 02:23.944
doing nothing.
Why can't they help?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.846
Because I told you to do it.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.450
Now I don't want to hear
no more back talk.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.552
Now clean this mess up.

02:31.585 --> 02:35.323
No. I'm not gonna do it.

02:38.426 --> 02:42.896
Lord... please help me before
I knock this boy's neck off.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.369
Eight...

02:48.402 --> 02:50.238
nine...

02:50.271 --> 02:51.972
t-ten!

02:52.005 --> 02:54.242
I wouldn't see a woman
that perplexed again

02:54.275 --> 02:56.410
until Palin found out
her daughter was knocked up.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.412
Now are you gonna clean up
this table

02:58.446 --> 03:01.382
or do I need to tell
your father?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.585
Whenever there was a problem
my mother couldn't handle,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.320
she'd call my father
for backup,

03:06.354 --> 03:08.489
like the governor bringing in
the National Guard.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.493
Ow!

03:13.627 --> 03:14.995
What's the situation?!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.897
Chris won't do
what I told him.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.499
You want me to do some dishes?!

03:18.532 --> 03:19.900
I'll do some dishes!

03:24.472 --> 03:26.374
I'll handle this.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.943
Oh! That was my...

03:39.320 --> 03:40.288
Yes!

03:42.723 --> 03:43.791
You know what?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.528
Go ahead. Tell him.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.629
I don't care.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.501
Fine.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.436
Drew, Tonya,
come clean this table up

03:55.469 --> 03:56.570
and wash the dishes.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.506
BOTH:
Yes, ma'am.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.611
I enjoyed time with my father,

04:03.644 --> 04:06.614
but I was afraid
this might be the last time.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.651
Where have you been?

04:10.684 --> 04:13.020
I stopped to get coffee.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.688
With his coffee coupon.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.491
Oh, coffee.
Oh, yeah, that-that's nice.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.059
Well, while you were out
taking your time

04:19.092 --> 04:20.661
sipping on coffee,

04:20.694 --> 04:23.030
uh, your son was here
staging a coup!

04:23.063 --> 04:24.064
A coup?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.566
What

04:25.599 --> 04:27.435
Chris!

04:27.468 --> 04:32.573
I spent 20 hours of labor
pushing out that big-eared boy,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.742
and he turns around
and does this to me?!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.744
Does what

04:36.777 --> 04:41.582
What did he do
You're on his side now?!

04:41.615 --> 04:44.318
No, no, I'm just trying
to find out what's going on.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.519
Oh, what's going on,
what's going on.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.887
Let me think about
what's going on.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.656
Your son is trying to kill me.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.424
That's what's
going on!

04:50.458 --> 04:53.961
I-I cook, I clean, I care

04:53.994 --> 04:56.597
for this family,
and what do I get in return?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.566
Just a full-scale mutiny!

04:58.599 --> 04:59.833
Led by a child

04:59.867 --> 05:01.502
who I bore for a man

05:01.535 --> 05:03.837
who's supposed to love and honor
and protect me!

05:03.871 --> 05:04.772
You know,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.640
I thought we were all
in this together,

05:06.674 --> 05:07.708
but you know what?

05:07.741 --> 05:10.010
I'm finding out now
that I'm just by myself!

05:10.043 --> 05:13.547
Rochelle, what did he do?

05:13.581 --> 05:18.986
I told Chris to wash the dishes.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.389
And he told me, "No."

05:21.422 --> 05:24.692
And what do you do?

05:24.725 --> 05:27.628
Nothing!

05:33.701 --> 05:35.969
While my father was trying
to figure out what to do,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.639
I was starting to realize
what I had done.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.574
What are you doing
here so early?

05:40.608 --> 05:41.909
It's a long story.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.076
Why you here?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.546
I'm always here
for breakfast.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.647
So what happened?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.816
I talked back to my mother;
she's telling my father;

05:48.849 --> 05:51.385
and I had to get out the house
before he got home.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.753
What were you thinking?

05:52.786 --> 05:53.854
She's always
making me do work

05:53.887 --> 05:56.424
while Drew and Tonya sit around
like it's a hotel.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.427
I mean, why do I have to be
a maid

05:59.460 --> 06:01.729
Do I have on a black skirt
with a white apron?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.464
That's a whole other type
of maid.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.733
You're a fool.
Mothers do have limits.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.900
I mean, there's only so much
they can take.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.969
You know, one day you just
refuse to do the housework,

06:09.002 --> 06:10.771
and then the next day
you wake up,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.640
and there's some Italian lady
naked in your kitchen

06:12.673 --> 06:14.675
at midnight eating
all your spumoni ice cream,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.610
and your dad comes out
and he's, like,

06:16.644 --> 06:18.679
"Hey, just, you know,
go back to bed.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.414
Forget all about it, Greg."

06:20.448 --> 06:22.916
Well, after my dad
knocks my brains out,

06:22.950 --> 06:25.819
I won't have to worry
about remembering anything.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.088
While I was trying to savor
my last day of life,

06:28.121 --> 06:31.425
Mr. Omar was trying
to savor a last meal.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.061
So, the next thing I know,
the doctors call

06:34.094 --> 06:36.864
and say I've gone
from a clean bill of health

06:36.897 --> 06:39.867
to who knows how much time
left to live.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.002
BOTH:
Tragic.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.473
You see, most people are
decapitated by flying hubcaps.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.709
Or fall down a flight of steps

06:48.742 --> 06:50.778
and get strangled
between banister rails.

06:50.811 --> 06:54.748
So knowing when I'm gonna die
allows me to make the most

06:54.782 --> 06:57.685
of my remaining days
and get my affairs in order.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.753
And he doesn't mean
business affairs.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.490
So from now on,
I'm gonna do the things

07:02.523 --> 07:04.057
I want to do
and say the things

07:04.091 --> 07:09.663
I want to say without worrying
about the consequences.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.469
Hey, Mr. Omar.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.004
Oh, hey, Mr. Julius.

07:17.037 --> 07:21.108
Unfortunately, I'm here
to give my 19-day notice.

07:21.141 --> 07:21.775
You moving out?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.712
Mm, no, more like moving on.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.846
Where you going?

07:25.879 --> 07:27.781
Well, that's the great mystery
of life,

07:27.815 --> 07:28.716
isn't it, Mr. Julius?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.251
Where do we go when we die?

07:31.284 --> 07:34.855
Dying? Mr. Omar,
that's terrible.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.023
Oh, no, it's not.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.693
'Cause for the next 19 days,
I'm gonna be living it up!

07:39.727 --> 07:41.529
Pass me the meatballs.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.229
Okay.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.832
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
where's Chris?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.099
Chris said he had to work late.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.569
Good, then he'll be home soon.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.870
Julius,

07:49.903 --> 07:51.171
your son is trying to kill me.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.107
Go find him and stop him.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.252
With my father on the way
to Doc's,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.788
I was a dead man working.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.560
We need to talk.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.164
I just need
to understand

08:17.197 --> 08:19.567
why you would talk
to your mother like that.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.669
Dad, Drew and Tonya
were sitting down watching TV,

08:21.702 --> 08:24.171
and I'm the only one
Mom said to go clean up.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.873
It's just not fair.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.675
You raised me to stand up
for myself,

08:27.708 --> 08:30.077
so why do I get in trouble
when I do it at home?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.912
Look, Chris, you might
win the battle,

08:31.945 --> 08:32.880
but you're gonna
lose the war.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.584
Sometimes it's not
about just being right.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.885
Hey, look,

08:37.918 --> 08:39.820
you need to apologize
to your mother.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.590
Why?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.592
Because she will make
your life miserable.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.660
You know how many times
I've been right

08:46.694 --> 08:48.328
and still had
to apologize?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.765
469,531 times.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.833
And counting.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.802
How is that even possible?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.803
Because she doesn't care.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.070
It doesn't make any sense.

08:57.104 --> 08:57.638
Exactly.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.873
Look, that's the #1 rule

08:59.907 --> 09:02.876
of living with women:
nothing makes sense.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.344
When you learn this,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.280
then you'll finally understand
what it is to be a man.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.784
Wrong or right, you
still have to be sorry.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.200
I had survived the walk home.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.869
Now all I had to do
was apologize,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.071
and my life would go back
to normal.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.874
So did you
talk to him?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.743
I talked to him.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.744
Good.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.647
Chris, clean up the table
and do the dishes.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.784
No.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.989
Well, it's been nice
knowing you, America.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.828
CHRIS ROCK:
I had put my foot down.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.264
But unfortunately,
it was into my own grave.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.966
So I thought
you talked to him?

09:58.999 --> 09:59.967
I did.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.001
And he's got a point.

10:01.034 --> 10:01.802
What?!

10:01.835 --> 10:03.671
Why should Drew and Tonya
watch TV

10:03.704 --> 10:04.938
while Chris cleans up
their mess?

10:04.972 --> 10:08.976
I do not have to explain
to him why I do

10:09.009 --> 10:09.977
the things
that I do.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.344
If I want him to do something

10:11.378 --> 10:13.647
that I don't want
the other kids to do,

10:13.681 --> 10:15.816
I probably have a good reason!

10:15.849 --> 10:17.851
And do you have a good reason?
No.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.787
But that doesn't matter!

10:19.820 --> 10:21.321
He's growing up, Rochelle.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.391
If you ask him to do something
that seems unfair,

10:24.424 --> 10:25.458
he's gonna
want to know why.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.861
You wanted a strong-minded kid,
well, you got one.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.698
Oh.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.833
Okay, I-I see.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.134
Oh, if he wants to be grown,

10:34.167 --> 10:36.036
then he's grown.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.905
Fine.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.107
How come when a woman
says "fine,"

10:40.140 --> 10:43.844
it's never actually fine?

10:43.877 --> 10:44.878
First thing in the morning,

10:44.912 --> 10:47.380
my mother did
the meanest thing yet: nothing.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.182
Why didn't you wake me up?
I'm late for school.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.951
You're grown.
Wake yourself up.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.385
You don't want to
do nothing for me,

10:52.419 --> 10:53.821
I ain't doing
nothing for you.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.922
And she didn't.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.024
She didn't do my laundry.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.726
Where are my underwear?

10:58.759 --> 10:59.993
You're grown.
Wash your own drawers.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.065
She didn't make my meals.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.066
Where's my breakfast?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.067
You're grown.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.335
You can cook your own food.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.341
While my mother was teaching me
a lesson about life,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.977
Mr. Omar was giving out
lessons about death.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.080
And I also will take that helmet
and those death darts.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.049
That's a Crock-Pot
and pens, man.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.951
Not in the jungle,
it's not.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.719
You know, I can make

11:25.753 --> 11:28.288
a hand grenade out of a can
of Cheez Whiz and a dress sock.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.958
Well, you need to use it
to blow your own brains out.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.961
Don't they have centers
for people like you?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.264
Bye.

11:40.133 --> 11:40.734
Excuse me.

11:40.768 --> 11:41.969
Hey, Monk.
Hey, Julius.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.205
Hey, aloha,
Mr. Julius.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.107
You can't have all these people
in the hallway.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.742
What you gonna do about it?

11:48.776 --> 11:49.642
I'm dying.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.079
Mr. Omar, these people
are turning my house

11:52.112 --> 11:53.080
into a fire hazard.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.315
Well, with all that asbestos

11:55.348 --> 11:57.050
in the walls and ceiling,

11:57.084 --> 11:58.952
you ain't got to worry
about no fire.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.453
It's the asthma
that's gonna kill you.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.122
Excuse me?
You're cheap!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.457
You're a bald-headed,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.393
penny-pinching skinflint.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.061
Watch yourself, Mr. Omar.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.763
What's to watch?! I'm dying.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.534
While my father was thinking
about breaking a lamp

12:14.567 --> 12:16.169
over Mr. Omar's head,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.005
I was trying not to break down.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.840
Dude, you look terrible.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.975
I know. It was
a rough morning.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.044
Mom decided she's not gonna
do anything for me anymore.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
Barely made it
to school.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.148
If you back down now, you'll
miss the one chance you have

12:28.181 --> 12:30.050
to make sure
your voice is heard.
I know.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.419
All I have to do is stick it out
just a little bit longer.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.988
She's been mad at me before,
and she'll be mad at me again.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.023
What's she gonna do,

12:36.056 --> 12:37.224
not be my mother anymore?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.192
(woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

12:39.226 --> 12:41.094
I'd like to return
this child.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.063
Do you have the receipt?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.198
Sure do.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.366
Looks good.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.135
Take this to the cashier
for your refund.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.069
Thank you.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.905
I was trying to become
my own person,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.907
but my mother still thought
she owned me.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.177
What you think
you're doing?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.580
I'm making breakfast.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.916
With my eggs?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.885
No, I bought the eggs,
and I bought the bacon.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.053
Oh.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.822
Well, you ain't
buy that skillet.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.190
You ain't buy that fire.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.492
You ain't buy that spatula.
You ain't buy that plate.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.394
Next time, I'll remember
to buy a paper plate.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.263
Ooh! Next time?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.166
Oh, next...? "Oh, next time,
I'll remember to buy a paper..."

13:19.199 --> 13:20.100
No, next time,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.836
you need to remember
this ain't your kitchen!

13:22.870 --> 13:26.206
This ain't your stove.
This ain't your floor.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.841
Those ain't your
frozen gizzards.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.576
That ain't your...!
You say none of this is mine,

13:29.609 --> 13:31.311
maybe I should find
someplace else to be.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.946
Uh-oh!

13:32.980 --> 13:33.947
Did y'all see that?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.448
I guess he
jumping bad now.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.217
You bad!
I guess you Shaft!

13:37.250 --> 13:39.086
You's a bad mother...

13:39.119 --> 13:40.854
Shut your mouth! No.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.190
Since you're so independent,
so liberated,

13:43.223 --> 13:45.258
maybe you need to go live
in the Statue of Liberty.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.459
Fine.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.196
I'm leaving.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.597
I stood my ground,

13:50.630 --> 13:53.833
and now I was gonna be
standing out on the street.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.142
CHRIS ROCK:
I left the house
before my mother

14:02.175 --> 14:04.111
asked for her suitcase back.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.078
Just say you're sorry.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.313
What for?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.981
Because you just got kicked out.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.216
Look, I don't care, all right?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.051
It's better than doing
everyone else's work.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.286
If you had been
cleaning up after me

14:13.320 --> 14:15.355
for the past ten years,
you'd know how I felt.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.289
How you gonna eat?

14:16.323 --> 14:17.624
I-I got a job.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.525
Where you gonna stay?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.193
I'll find a place.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.161
Will you quit being stupid,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.196
and go clean the kitchen
like Mama told you?

14:23.230 --> 14:26.433
Look, if you want it clean
so bad, you go do it.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.368
So you're really leaving?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.070
Yeah.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.140
Well, can I have your radio?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.908
Fine.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.246
Good luck, Chris.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.487
ROCHELLE:
Yeah, since
this morning.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.356
I mean, you know,
it's not a big deal,

14:49.389 --> 14:51.224
but if Chris calls,
can you let me know?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.426
Okay.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.627
Thanks, Doc.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.997
Why is this table such a mess?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.165
Somebody fired the maid.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.699
'Cause I'm not gonna
clean it up.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.134
They're not gonna
clean it up.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.569
When I find him,
Chris is gonna

15:02.602 --> 15:04.271
clean it up.
When you find him?

15:04.304 --> 15:05.705
Chris and Mom got
into another fight.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.374
And she threw him
out of the house.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.476
What do you mean,
you threw him out?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.312
I may have implied

15:12.345 --> 15:14.982
that since he was
so self-sufficient,

15:15.015 --> 15:17.684
that maybe he should live
someplace else.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.252
And then he left.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.620
You telling me
you kicked our son out

15:20.653 --> 15:22.022
because he didn't
do the dishes?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.123
Exactly.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.591
Not exactly.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.359
But it's the principle, Julius!

15:27.194 --> 15:28.428
Do you know what the words

15:28.461 --> 15:29.429
"too far" mean?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.663
Actually, she didn't.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.032
You're cutting the boy's arm off

15:32.065 --> 15:33.166
for sticking his finger
in the fan.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.235
What?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.970
Cutting off his arm?

15:37.004 --> 15:38.005
I don't get it.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.140
So am I the fan?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.241
I'm pretty sure
Chris is the arm.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.175
No, I think
the arm is the arm.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.311
Chris is the boy.
Yeah, Chris is the boy.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.246
Look, sticking his finger
in the fan

15:46.279 --> 15:47.680
is just the equivalent
of doing something stupid.

15:47.714 --> 15:48.815
Like talking
back to Mom.
Right.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.184
So cutting the arm off is
kicking him out of the house?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.286
Exactly.
So if he stuck

15:53.320 --> 15:56.089
his finger in the fan,
and I didn't like it,

15:56.123 --> 15:58.258
cutting his arm off
so he wouldn't do it again

15:58.291 --> 15:59.292
wouldn't help.
Wouldn't help.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.527
Oh.
Oh.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.029
Got it.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.164
I'm-I'm gonna go find Chris.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.698
It's Saturday.
He probably just went

16:05.732 --> 16:07.734
someplace in the neighborhood
to cool off.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.237
Hopefully, not under a fan.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.206
While my dad was talking sense
into his woman,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
a woman was talking
some sense into me.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.143
Boy, are you crazy?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.078
You are lucky she
just threw you out.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.679
But, V...
Chris, you challenged
her authority.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.381
You left her no choice.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.316
So if me or Tonya say no,

16:23.350 --> 16:25.218
are you just gonna
kick us out, too?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.619
Yes!
No.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.321
I didn't kick him out, Drew.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.322
He left.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.290
After you kicked him out.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.524
He only left
because you told him

16:31.558 --> 16:33.126
to go live in
the Statue of Liberty.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.394
CHRIS:
Okay, how am I

16:34.427 --> 16:37.097
supposed to talk to her if she
won't listen to anything I say?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.398
Chris, you are a child.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.766
Parents don't negotiate

16:39.799 --> 16:41.168
with children.

16:41.201 --> 16:41.968
Even though I hate Chris,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.570
I still wish
he would come back home.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.571
I don't want him

16:44.604 --> 16:46.406
to get stabbed
or shot

16:46.439 --> 16:48.275
or turned out
or hooked on drugs.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.078
Your brother is not
gonna get hooked on drugs.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.579
Actually, he probably will.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.314
Runaways tend to fall into

16:54.347 --> 16:56.649
dangerous situations
pretty quickly.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.485
And drugs and alcohol
provide a sedative

16:58.518 --> 16:59.619
to the trauma and isolation.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.489
Chris, you need to go

17:02.522 --> 17:03.590
back home.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.425
Why? It's just gonna
happen again.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.393
What if he doesn't
come back?

17:06.426 --> 17:07.394
If he does,

17:07.427 --> 17:08.328
it's just gonna happen again.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.364
You know, if it was me
and it was my kid,

17:11.398 --> 17:12.432
I think I would've
thought of

17:12.465 --> 17:13.666
a different way
to say what I said,

17:13.700 --> 17:15.502
so that my kid still
learned his lesson

17:15.535 --> 17:16.636
while keeping
our family together.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.805
VANESSA:
It's dishes!

17:18.838 --> 17:21.408
You're acting like she told you

17:21.441 --> 17:22.475
to bring down
the mob!

17:22.509 --> 17:23.676
Actually, the mob was

17:23.710 --> 17:25.178
slightly less vindictive
than my mother.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.780
Hey, Vanessa.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.848
Chris, let's go.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.783
While me and my mother

17:30.817 --> 17:32.485
were still bent out of shape,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.322
Mr. Omar was about
to straighten something out.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.656
Oh, hey, Mr. Julius!

17:36.689 --> 17:38.525
Chris, go upstairs.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.161
And don't say anything to
your mother till I get up there.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.196
I don't want her
throwing you out again.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.136
Hey, Chris!

17:49.169 --> 17:50.237
What?

17:50.270 --> 17:53.440
Um, I was wondering
had you rented my apartment yet.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.708
You forgot to say,
"bald-headed skinflint."

17:55.742 --> 17:57.444
Yeah.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.880
About that: I just wanted
to say I'm very sorry.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.215
Whatever.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.350
What difference is it to you

18:03.383 --> 18:05.352
whether I rented
the place anyway?

18:05.385 --> 18:06.353
Won't you be dead?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.354
Uh, no, no.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.321
Uh, turned out,

18:08.355 --> 18:09.556
there was a mistake.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.392
I got Mr. Watkins' prognosis,
and he got mine.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.393
Who is Mr. Watkins?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.361
He's the guy that's dying

18:14.394 --> 18:15.428
instead of me.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.499
Yeah, misdiagnosed
with a terminal condition

18:19.532 --> 18:22.435
by a doctor
with a nearsighted nurse.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.803
Tragic. Tragic!

18:23.836 --> 18:26.406
Well... I guess
that's good news.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.210
Uh, look, look, look,
Mr., Mr. Julius,

18:30.243 --> 18:31.378
Mr. Julius.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.313
I was speaking my mind,

18:33.346 --> 18:35.382
but my mind
wasn't in the right place.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.684
So you don't think
I'm a bald-headed...

18:38.751 --> 18:39.719
Don't say it!

18:39.752 --> 18:41.788
Don't you ever say that.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.257
You're a good man, Mr. Julius.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.526
Mr. Omar,

18:46.559 --> 18:48.495
next time you think
you're dying,

18:48.528 --> 18:51.364
before you start calling
people names, be sure.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.704
Rent's due on the first.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.210
Hallelujah!

19:08.315 --> 19:10.917
All right, first of all,

19:10.950 --> 19:14.187
in the future, no kid gets
thrown out of the house

19:14.221 --> 19:15.422
unless we both throw them out.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.558
Second,

19:18.591 --> 19:19.826
your mother's in charge.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.894
When she tells you
to do something, you do it.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.963
You got it?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.466
I'm talking to everybody here.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.967
Now, do we all understand?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.968
ALL:
Yes.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.404
Good.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.905
Chris, apologize to your mother.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.842
I'm sorry.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.477
JULIUS:
Sorry for what?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.546
Mom, I'm sorry
for being disrespectful

19:39.579 --> 19:40.647
and talking back to you.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.949
JULIUS:
Good.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.617
Rochelle?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.454
Rochelle.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.492
Chris, I'm sorry
for being unreasonable.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.660
I know I was unfair.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.462
JULIUS:
Okay.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.929
This is over and done.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.965
Chris, give your mother a hug.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.708
I'm sorry, baby.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.543
I love you.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.679
I'm sorry, too, Mom.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.680
JULIUS:
Great.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.283
Drew, Tonya, go watch TV.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.551
Chris, clean this mess up.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.719
Yeah, baby!

20:19.752 --> 20:24.557
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.560
