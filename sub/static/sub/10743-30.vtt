                      ROGER:
                 Come on, Kathy.
         Ooh!

16:35.295 --> 16:37.595
      Thank you very much
 for inviting me to your party.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.597
    I had a real good time.
        I'm glad you could come.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.765
    I am too.
   It was keen.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.435
 You'll-- You'll be able to make
  it home all right, won't you?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.471
     Oh, sure, we just live
        down the block.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.439
       We'll-- We'll run
       all the way. Heh!

16:49.709 --> 16:51.109
             I'll race you home.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.776
            AMANDA:
        Last one home's
         a dirty bird.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.845
            BELLOWS:
 I don't wanna race. I'm tired.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.548
            AMANDA:
    No wonder you're tired.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.950
            I saw you playing
             Spin the Bottle

16:58.952 --> 17:00.485
                with that rotten
                 Katy Golato.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.320
Yeah? And I saw you playing
hopscotch with Roger Healey.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.521
                    I did not.
   You did too.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.656
                   I did not.
  You did too.

17:05.657 --> 17:09.026
       AMANDA: I did not!
     BELLOWS: You did too!

17:27.746 --> 17:29.847
          Oh.

17:29.849 --> 17:30.848
       Yes?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.082
            I'm Charles Fakeling

17:32.084 --> 17:35.619
        with the National Bureau
        of Pure Food and Drugs.

17:35.621 --> 17:39.089
 Hmm. Yes, Mr. Fakeling.
Um, what can I do for you?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.925
             I'd like to ask you
               a few questions.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.526
              You do have a top
             security clearance,

17:42.528 --> 17:43.527
              don't you, doctor?

17:43.529 --> 17:45.362
             Of course.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.101
    Doctor, does your wife cook?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.537
        Uh...

17:52.539 --> 17:54.605
     we eat out
 most of the time.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.907
            Do you like to cook?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.609
Well, I-- I barbecue
occasionally, but--

17:58.611 --> 18:00.011
Well, I don't see any need--

18:00.013 --> 18:01.946
            Do you like to bake?

18:01.948 --> 18:03.447
         Bake?

18:03.449 --> 18:04.482
                        Cakes?

18:06.118 --> 18:09.587
        I never baked a cake
          in all my life.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.728
   Will you tell me
 what this is about?

18:22.902 --> 18:24.234
                 A few days ago,

18:24.236 --> 18:26.671
       your wife brought a piece
       of cake into a laboratory

18:26.673 --> 18:28.505
                 in Cocoa Beach
               to have analyzed.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.207
       I know.

18:30.209 --> 18:33.044
  But I don't see what
that's gotta do with you.

18:33.046 --> 18:35.512
   She simply wanted to know
the ingredients, so she could--

18:35.514 --> 18:37.081
    That's what brought me here,
               doctor.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.249
         One of the ingredients.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.551
I don't understand.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.720
         We don't either.
      We can't identify it.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.658
  Heh-heh. Surely our laboratory
      here will help you out.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.627
          We tried them.

18:49.629 --> 18:54.465
       We also tried the lab
      at the CIA and the FBI.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.570
  There's something very unusual
      about this ingredient.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.105
       It doesn't respond
   to any of our known tests.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.408
        That's incredible.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.845
     I'll tell you something
      even more incredible:

19:07.847 --> 19:10.881
    a professor of Medicine
       at Harvard thinks

19:10.883 --> 19:12.850
  that this unknown ingredient

19:12.852 --> 19:17.120
     is similar in molecular
     structure to mepatharin.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.589
             Mepatharin?

19:20.426 --> 19:22.025
       I'm not familiar with it.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.227
       You know that project
         they're working on

19:24.229 --> 19:25.830
        to arrest old age?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.830
             Oh, of course.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.633
             And that isn't all.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.569
      They think this substance
    will do even more than that.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.571
               They think
         it will restore youth.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.108
    They think there's some kind
          of property in it

19:38.110 --> 19:40.645
     that arrests deterioration.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.346
              Doctor,

19:42.348 --> 19:45.449
 this could be one of the major
breakthroughs of our generation.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.218
          I want to know where
       that substance came from.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.020
                So do I.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.523

      come along.

   any of these old things.

         Dr. Bellows,
   would you explain to him.

22:02.689 --> 22:07.091
Major Nelson, the ingredient was
          in your cake.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.026
            Would you like
           to explain that?

22:09.028 --> 22:12.028
       I certainly would.
          But I can't.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.363
     But my theory is, sir,

22:13.365 --> 22:15.466
   that, uh, when Mrs. Bellows
     took that piece of cake

22:15.468 --> 22:17.133
      to have it analyzed
       at the laboratory,

22:17.135 --> 22:18.902
     one of the technicians
       accidentally, uh,

22:18.904 --> 22:20.971
     poured the ingredients
    that you're looking for

22:20.973 --> 22:22.172
     into the cake, and, uh--

22:22.174 --> 22:25.309
       Major, heh-heh, you can
         do better than that.

          get in touch with me.

       hot bowl of chicken soup.

                     TONY:
                  I don't want
               any chicken soup.

           Yes?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.794
   I want you to bake me another
        one exactly like it.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.696

             that I need.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.833
          Well, I-- I don't know
                which one.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.034

Oh, but you see, master,
I never follow a recipe.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.340

   have an instinct.

If you follow a recipe--

23:30.509 --> 23:32.276
             It's very important
              that you remember

               every ingredient
              that went into it.

23:33.846 --> 23:34.945
            It's very important.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.947

             without knowing it,

   I think I have it.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.763
       Okay. I knew you wouldn't
              let me down.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.666

23:56.668 --> 23:58.468

  Jeannie, you're the best genie
        a master ever had.

      [CHUCKLING]
          Oh.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.611
                Do you know
              what this means?

             Nobody's ever gonna
                get old again.

           Mm-hm.
 How does it taste, master?

24:12.551 --> 24:13.717
