01:38.400 --> 01:41.199
It was a surprise, huh? Holy cow!

01:41.200 --> 01:44.360
Yeah, surprise is an understatement.
Oh, my God!

01:44.361 --> 01:46.840
It was worse when I got
the phone call about this.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.961
Oh, jeepers creepers!

01:48.962 --> 01:51.801
It was like one of those...
what, what, what?

01:51.802 --> 01:54.241
Yeah, it was 2.30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.

01:54.242 --> 01:57.482
"You're telling me I need to come.
Goddamn, I'm sleeping, why?"

01:57.483 --> 02:01.043
"Well, we found the blow poke."
"OK, I'm coming."

02:20.326 --> 02:24.206
You push that with... See, there's
a little bit of fresh metal there.

02:24.207 --> 02:26.926
That's because of the knife.
That's because of the knife.

02:26.927 --> 02:31.087
The rest of that then
looks fairly oxidised.

02:31.088 --> 02:34.887
To me, it looks even... See inside,
the threads are there? Right.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.367
The thing's dirty,
it's got grime on it.

02:37.368 --> 02:40.328
If you take the cue tip,
particularly down this end here,

02:40.329 --> 02:44.328
it come off dirty, very dirty,
so it hasn't been cleaned. Right.

02:44.329 --> 02:47.129
There's plenty of dust
and debris on it.

02:47.130 --> 02:51.930
There's nothing here that's jumping
out saying it looks like blood,

02:51.931 --> 02:55.650
and there's no atypical
positive reaction to blood.

02:55.651 --> 02:59.731
OK. You know, there's nothing here.
OK.

02:59.732 --> 03:03.651
Will we use it and then if we get
fucked, we'll just say you? Yeah.

03:03.652 --> 03:06.332
THEY LAUGH

03:06.333 --> 03:09.893
All right, come and help me... Help
me put this back together, brother.

03:11.813 --> 03:13.613
PHONE RINGS

03:13.614 --> 03:14.854
Hey, Mike.

03:17.094 --> 03:19.414
Yeah, I'm not worried about it.

03:23.335 --> 03:25.135
Nah, don't worry about it.

03:26.175 --> 03:27.736
I understand, all right.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.896
No blood on the blow poke.

03:36.057 --> 03:39.977
Er, whatever. I mean, whatever
he used, there's no blood.

03:41.978 --> 03:43.577
Yeah. OK?

03:43.578 --> 03:45.778
All right. Bye.

03:59.900 --> 04:04.020
It's one of those moments that
could be a turning-point moment,

04:04.021 --> 04:07.541
you know,
where the jury's sort of...

04:08.782 --> 04:12.261
..look at Hardin and say,
"Now what are you going to do?"

04:12.262 --> 04:17.062
You know, "You've been talking
about this missing blow poke

04:17.063 --> 04:19.942
"since May 5th.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.343
"And here it is.

04:23.344 --> 04:26.783
"And it's not bent and it's not
covered with blood

04:26.784 --> 04:31.224
"and it wasn't gotten rid of
and it's not mysteriously missing.

04:31.225 --> 04:35.225
"So... what are you going
to say now?"

04:36.306 --> 04:41.826
Um... it's one of those moments
that trial lawyers enjoy.

04:49.787 --> 04:51.468
Ah, jeez!

04:54.748 --> 04:56.628
Trial lawyers and film-makers.

05:00.189 --> 05:03.549
Don't be overconfident.
Do not be overconfident.

05:15.671 --> 05:18.551
Hi, Julia. How are you?

05:18.552 --> 05:21.431
Good, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.

05:21.432 --> 05:22.912
Oh, thanks.

05:32.754 --> 05:35.234
That's fine. You're welcome to.
Excuse me.

05:47.276 --> 05:49.635
Further evidence from the defendant?
Yes, sir.

05:49.636 --> 05:53.597
At this time, the defence will call
Detective Art Holland to the stand.

05:58.677 --> 06:01.757
Do you solemnly swear the testimony
you are about to give the court

06:01.758 --> 06:04.157
and the jury in the case
now being heard to be the truth

06:04.158 --> 06:06.117
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

06:06.118 --> 06:07.759
Yes, I do. Please be seated.

06:12.359 --> 06:16.320
Detective Holland, good morning,
first of all. Good morning.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.600
After you showed us
this item in May,

06:21.601 --> 06:25.640
that the district attorney was
contending was similar to the...

06:25.641 --> 06:27.280
to the murder weapon,

06:27.281 --> 06:30.641
did you ever ask either myself...

06:30.642 --> 06:33.601
or Mr Maher or Mr Durette

06:33.602 --> 06:37.282
whether, after having looked at it
and seen it finally in May,

06:37.283 --> 06:42.203
whether we ever had located
the blow poke?

06:42.204 --> 06:43.764
No, I didn't.

06:52.285 --> 06:54.444
Did you just assume...

06:54.445 --> 06:56.446
that it was gone?

06:57.806 --> 06:59.606
Gone or put up somewhere.

07:07.727 --> 07:11.048
Let me show you what's been marked
defence exhibit 280.

07:19.489 --> 07:21.568
You see that? Yes, sir.

07:21.569 --> 07:25.890
Now, this 280, that's a blow poke,
isn't it?

07:27.050 --> 07:31.410
Is that what it appears to be?
It appears to be a blow poke.

07:31.411 --> 07:37.051
And the metal tip at the end
that's on this one...

07:40.052 --> 07:42.252
..isn't on that one, right?

07:43.772 --> 07:44.972
That's correct.

07:44.973 --> 07:49.053
But other than that, if we look
at the handle, for example...

07:54.174 --> 07:56.934
..that's pretty much
the same thing, isn't it?

07:59.295 --> 08:03.694
Do you see this end here
you blow into? It appears to be.

08:03.695 --> 08:07.736
You see a bunch of
spiderweb-looking things...

08:08.936 --> 08:12.376
..on it? You see on the handle area
there, you see that?

08:12.377 --> 08:14.296
It's hard to tell from the plastic.

08:14.297 --> 08:18.337
All right, can you see
the dead bugs in the little...

08:19.778 --> 08:22.537
..plastic thing there?
It appears to be.

08:22.538 --> 08:25.418
This doesn't appear to you
to be mangled, does it?

08:26.739 --> 08:29.178
It doesn't appear to have
any dents in it.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.378
Does this appear to you, 280,

08:31.379 --> 08:35.938
to be the blow poke that Mr Hardin
has been talking about

08:35.940 --> 08:39.818
being mysteriously missing
since this trial began?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.341
Objection, characterisation.
Sustained.

08:43.341 --> 08:46.020
Does this appear to you
to be the blow poke

08:46.021 --> 08:52.382
that Mr Hardin stated in his opening
statement was mysteriously missing?

09:06.824 --> 09:09.184
Their problem is,
if they assent to that,

09:09.185 --> 09:12.345
if they don't like the results,
they're sort of stuck with them.

10:12.874 --> 10:15.513
The prosecutors have talked about
a missing blow poke

10:15.514 --> 10:17.594
and how it could have been
the murder weapon.

10:17.595 --> 10:19.354
It could have been
the murder weapon.

10:19.355 --> 10:22.314
Today, the defence pulled out
a blow poke and told jurors

10:22.315 --> 10:23.794
it wasn't missing at all.

10:23.795 --> 10:27.476
They claim police just never
saw it in the garage.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.836
I asked Jim Hardin if he was
surprised by today's developments.

10:33.837 --> 10:35.196
He said he wasn't,

10:35.197 --> 10:37.796
that he was expecting something
like this to happen.

10:37.797 --> 10:39.757
He was expecting something
like this...

10:39.758 --> 10:42.437
He was expecting something
like this to happen.

10:42.438 --> 10:45.678
In general, I got a chance to look
at the blow poke during lunch

10:45.679 --> 10:49.078
and it's definitely not the same
as the one that my Aunt Candace

10:49.079 --> 10:51.718
has brought into court,
so that leaves

10:51.719 --> 10:54.879
a lot of speculation there
as far as things go.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.719
Um... it has very...

10:57.720 --> 11:01.600
very distinct differences
between the two.

11:01.601 --> 11:04.280
But, I mean, more importantly,
the thing is,

11:04.281 --> 11:06.961
that regardless of, you know,
you produce an autop...

11:06.962 --> 11:11.361
you produce a blow poke the day
that you rest your case

11:11.362 --> 11:16.042
and I feel like it's just to really
create a commotion and things.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.402
The fact is, you can show that,
you can claim whatever you want

11:19.403 --> 11:21.883
about it, it's not going to
change the autopsy report,

11:21.884 --> 11:24.923
so it really doesn't put a hole
in the prosecution's case the way

11:24.924 --> 11:27.964
I think David Rudolf's attitude
thought that it would today.

11:27.965 --> 11:31.244
It doesn't change the fact that
my mother's autopsy report says

11:31.245 --> 11:33.924
she was beaten to death,
and if it was with a blow poke,

11:33.925 --> 11:36.165
if this was the blow poke,
I don't know,

11:36.166 --> 11:38.845
but it was with something
and that's how she ended up

11:38.846 --> 11:40.485
at the bottom of the stairs.

11:40.486 --> 11:44.087
Nothing is going to change that,
you know, that's finalised.

11:47.247 --> 11:50.487
That was easy, wasn't it? OK, sure.
Done and done.

11:50.488 --> 11:52.048
Can I go home now?

11:55.209 --> 11:57.328
The defendant brought into court

11:57.329 --> 12:00.208
what they've described as
a found blow poke.

12:00.209 --> 12:04.009
With that,
Candace Zamperini undertook to see

12:04.010 --> 12:06.649
whether she could locate
the other blow pokes

12:06.650 --> 12:10.730
that she had given to
friend and family members.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.450
She's been able to locate
two of those

12:13.451 --> 12:15.290
and they were sent to my office

12:15.291 --> 12:17.531
and I wanted to inform the court
of that

12:17.532 --> 12:19.771
to make sure
that you were aware of it.

12:19.772 --> 12:23.133
So we do not intend to offer that
in evidence at this point.

12:24.653 --> 12:28.692
I'm letting you know that they're
available and they can look at those

12:28.693 --> 12:31.533
and inspect them in my office.
And I appreciate that.

12:31.534 --> 12:36.373
I didn't get the facts yesterday
cos I didn't see it on the machine.

12:36.374 --> 12:39.734
But we'll take a look at it
over the break today. Thank you.

12:39.735 --> 12:42.174
Otherwise, are counsel ready
to proceed? Yes, sir.

12:42.175 --> 12:43.895
All right.

12:49.176 --> 12:51.417
John, this one is quite hollow.

12:53.457 --> 12:56.497
Hmm! Not a bad way
to end the case, huh?

12:58.058 --> 13:01.697
Make sure he says
that it's the same rounded edge.

13:01.698 --> 13:06.779
Rounded edges, yeah. There's
a little bevel there. No screws.

13:08.259 --> 13:10.978
Appears to be a little thread
in there. The other one.

13:10.979 --> 13:13.659
Don't, one's enough, Ron.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.420
Leave it. Don't break it.

13:16.780 --> 13:21.420
Have they been in the basement too?
Yeah. Look down here.

13:21.421 --> 13:23.980
I mean, that's...

13:23.981 --> 13:27.061
The blow pokes match.

13:27.062 --> 13:28.501
How big is that?

13:28.502 --> 13:31.342
Candace just can't keep her fucking
mouth shut.

13:32.382 --> 13:33.663
Thank you.

13:34.783 --> 13:37.543
I don't think I'd be here
if she'd kept her mouth shut.

13:40.144 --> 13:43.103
Defendant's 301 and 302 are
the other two blow pokes

13:43.104 --> 13:46.944
that Miss Zamperini had sent
to the district attorney's office

13:46.945 --> 13:48.984
that we just got over lunch,
correct?

13:48.985 --> 13:50.344
That's correct.

13:50.345 --> 13:52.224
And have you had a chance, sir,

13:52.225 --> 13:55.185
to compare defence exhibits
301 and 302

13:55.186 --> 13:57.665
with defendant's exhibit 280A,

13:57.666 --> 14:00.345
the one that was found
in Mr Peterson's home?

14:00.346 --> 14:04.346
I've only observed one of the two
that was sent, not both of them.

14:04.347 --> 14:07.587
All right, well, why don't you take
a look at the two of them here,

14:07.588 --> 14:09.187
if you could?

14:09.188 --> 14:12.387
This is a 280, the one that was...
Yes, sir.

14:12.388 --> 14:14.147
..found in Mr Peterson's home.

14:14.148 --> 14:18.188
And this is 301, one of the ones
that were sent. Yes, sir.

14:18.189 --> 14:21.709
Can you compare those two
for the jury?

14:21.710 --> 14:23.550
Are they the same height?

14:25.870 --> 14:28.269
The defendant's exhibit's
a little taller.

14:28.270 --> 14:29.991
The length's a little longer.

14:35.632 --> 14:37.431
Does it have a bevel there?

14:37.432 --> 14:38.791
Yes, sir.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.911
Threads inside?

14:40.912 --> 14:42.192
Yes, sir.

14:43.793 --> 14:50.313
So, can we agree that the missing
blow poke has been found?

14:50.314 --> 14:52.034
Objection. Sustained.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.835
We move 301 and 302 into evidence,
your honour. It's allowed.

15:02.035 --> 15:05.315
Did... Not that photograph.

15:05.316 --> 15:07.275
Oh, here's the little, um...

15:07.276 --> 15:10.076
Dust, it looks like
a spider leg here.

15:11.197 --> 15:14.316
This was supposed to be some type
of... something to make you think

15:14.317 --> 15:17.156
that blow poke had been there
since December 2001, I guess.

15:17.157 --> 15:19.597
Here's a cobweb, that's significant.

15:19.598 --> 15:22.758
Here's a little bit of...
goo or something.

15:24.319 --> 15:27.518
Ladies and gentlemen,
we really don't know what this is.

15:27.519 --> 15:30.838
You've been given no information
about who found it,

15:30.839 --> 15:33.800
when it was found, why it was there.

15:35.480 --> 15:39.840
So I argue to you that exhibit 280A
is just a piece of nothing.

15:39.841 --> 15:41.161
Nothing.

15:42.361 --> 15:45.521
We have never told you
that we are absolutely certain

15:45.522 --> 15:48.681
that it was the blow poke
that killed Miss Peterson.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.362
We do believe, if it wasn't the blow
poke that Candace had given them,

15:52.363 --> 15:54.482
that it was something similar
to that,

15:54.483 --> 15:57.162
and you've heard from expert
testimony why we believe that.

15:57.163 --> 15:59.643
But they are talking about us doing
something last-minute

15:59.644 --> 16:02.403
when they dared to pull that piece
of evidence out in front of you

16:02.404 --> 16:04.163
two days before they rested.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.124
Does that make common sense to you?

16:06.125 --> 16:07.484
You need to keep in mind,

16:07.485 --> 16:10.284
we're not dealing with
the average individual over here.

16:10.285 --> 16:12.565
We're dealing with
a fictional writer.

16:13.926 --> 16:16.765
Some people even say
he's a good fictional writer.

16:16.766 --> 16:20.887
He is a person who knows
how to create a fictional plot.

16:22.127 --> 16:23.527
And then there's Brad.

16:26.407 --> 16:32.008
Do you really believe
that Kathleen knew...

16:33.888 --> 16:36.809
..that Mr Peterson was bisexual?

16:39.129 --> 16:42.409
Does that make common sense to you
that it was OK with her

16:42.410 --> 16:46.689
to go to work while he stayed
at home and communicated by e-mail

16:46.690 --> 16:50.490
and telephone with people
he was planning on having sex with?

16:50.491 --> 16:53.370
And this isn't just
a computer relationship.

16:53.371 --> 16:55.851
I asked Brad what they were going
to do. He told you.

16:55.852 --> 16:57.611
And I don't mean
to offend anybody,

16:57.612 --> 16:59.971
but he did say they were going
to have anal sex.

16:59.972 --> 17:04.291
The only reason that meeting didn't
take place was because of Brad.

17:04.292 --> 17:08.973
It wasn't because of Mr Peterson.
He was fired up and ready to go.

17:10.013 --> 17:14.613
And you honestly believe that
Kathleen Peterson knew about that?

17:14.614 --> 17:16.334
Would have approved of that?

17:16.335 --> 17:20.973
And it wasn't just Brad, you saw the
rest of the things on his computer.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.775
Once again, those things were
so filthy

17:23.776 --> 17:26.295
we can't even show them on TV.

17:26.296 --> 17:32.936
Filth, pure filth. This isn't people
involved in a relationship.

17:32.937 --> 17:38.298
This is just any which way.
This is called hard-core porn.

17:39.858 --> 17:43.017
Do you think she approved of
this type of activity

17:43.018 --> 17:45.298
while she's off at work or sleeping?

17:45.299 --> 17:47.618
I argue to you
that doesn't make sense.

17:47.619 --> 17:51.499
And that's not the way soul mates
conduct themselves.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.260
That is not.

17:58.181 --> 17:59.820
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:59.821 --> 18:03.220
this photograph is
the first photograph taken

18:03.221 --> 18:05.062
of Kathleen Peterson...

18:06.822 --> 18:09.301
..at the autopsy table.

18:09.302 --> 18:13.703
It shows the very graphic,
brutal nature of this killing.

18:14.943 --> 18:20.663
Ladies and gentlemen, if a picture
is truly worth a thousand words,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.664
then this photograph...

18:23.784 --> 18:26.184
..at least speaks a thousand words.

18:26.185 --> 18:28.265
This photograph speaks
a thousand words.

18:29.385 --> 18:31.464
Look at all of these photographs

18:31.465 --> 18:33.866
that show that this woman
was beaten.

18:35.626 --> 18:37.306
I was thinking...

18:38.306 --> 18:41.186
..if a picture is worth
a thousand words,

18:41.187 --> 18:43.467
and if we only knew...

18:45.307 --> 18:48.747
..what Kathleen Peterson knew
at the time of her death,

18:48.748 --> 18:51.387
and I started looking
around the scene

18:51.388 --> 18:53.509
and in the stairwell
and thinking...

18:55.149 --> 18:57.069
.."What if those walls could talk?

18:58.109 --> 18:59.509
"What would they say?"

19:01.150 --> 19:04.069
Ladies and gentlemen,
these walls are talking.

19:04.070 --> 19:11.270
Kathleen Peterson is talking to us
through the blood on these walls.

19:11.271 --> 19:17.272
She is screaming at us
for truth and for justice.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.712
It's all in these photographs.

19:22.673 --> 19:24.552
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:24.553 --> 19:28.113
they've said Kathleen Peterson
died of an accident.

19:29.154 --> 19:32.273
We've said
that she has died of murder.

19:32.274 --> 19:35.394
And we ask that you return
that verdict.

19:35.395 --> 19:36.875
Thank you.

19:39.435 --> 19:41.794
Well, let me tell you
what my gut is.

19:41.795 --> 19:45.635
My gut is that what we want to do...

19:45.636 --> 19:51.236
is structure it around
the whole reasonable doubt concept.

19:51.237 --> 19:55.036
OK. Go through the stuff
that we do have evidence for.

19:55.037 --> 19:56.118
Mm-hm.

19:57.158 --> 19:59.997
That she fell,
they've seen the stairs,

19:59.998 --> 20:02.477
they know how easy it is
to fall there.

20:02.478 --> 20:05.558
You know, that the blood
on her feet, you know,

20:05.559 --> 20:08.678
we can do the scenario
of her being down on the ground

20:08.679 --> 20:11.559
for some period of time.
We can do all that,

20:11.560 --> 20:14.359
and then to say,
but it's not our burden. All right.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.119
And what this case is really about

20:16.120 --> 20:19.480
is whether they've proven
their case beyond reasonable doubt.

20:19.481 --> 20:25.121
And then I think we want to hit
the ten biggest reasonable doubts.

20:25.122 --> 20:27.841
Er, and, um...

20:27.842 --> 20:31.522
then I think... and I want
to discuss each.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.402
Mm-hm.
And spend some time on each.

20:34.403 --> 20:37.403
But then I think I want to say,
"Now, that's ten...

20:38.724 --> 20:41.963
"I could do another 20." Mm-hm.

20:41.964 --> 20:45.964
"I could spend another four hours
going through another 20."

20:45.965 --> 20:50.244
And just list them. Ten is nice
if they're not equally strong,

20:50.245 --> 20:53.485
but strong enough that none of them
get to the point of being...

20:53.486 --> 20:55.325
I think we can... We probably can,

20:55.326 --> 20:58.926
but I think it's important that
they all be of substantial weight.

20:58.927 --> 21:03.086
Otherwise you're better with seven
or eight or whatever. Oh, I agree.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.766
The blow poke's not missing.

21:04.767 --> 21:08.447
I mean, the blow poke is sort of
like what Clinton said.

21:08.448 --> 21:12.047
It's the economy, stupid.
It's the blow poke, stupid.

21:12.048 --> 21:15.368
I mean, it's here, they tied...

21:15.369 --> 21:21.010
they hitched their star to this
wagon from the very beginning.

21:22.330 --> 21:25.569
I guess reasonable doubt number one
is the blow poke is here.

21:25.570 --> 21:27.930
And it's not the murder weapon. OK.

21:27.931 --> 21:30.011
Er... there's no cast-off.

21:35.492 --> 21:38.532
Er... there's no brain injuries.

21:39.572 --> 21:44.492
I think it's important for me
to make the jury understand

21:44.493 --> 21:49.053
that this is not about whether
we've proven Michael is innocent.

21:49.054 --> 21:52.333
It's not even about whether
Michael IS innocent.

21:52.334 --> 21:57.094
You know, in Scotland
they have a verdict

21:57.095 --> 22:00.575
that is either guilty or not proven.

22:01.856 --> 22:04.935
And here we say
guilty or not guilty.

22:04.936 --> 22:07.855
Well, not guilty is not the same
as innocent.

22:07.856 --> 22:11.696
And not guilty is really
the equivalent of not proven.

22:11.697 --> 22:13.536
Not proven beyond reasonable doubt.

22:13.537 --> 22:18.577
If I spend too much time
arguing that he's innocent,

22:18.578 --> 22:23.018
I, in essence, I relieve the State
of its burden of proof.

22:23.019 --> 22:25.858
I invite the jury the weigh -

22:25.859 --> 22:29.539
well, is Rudolf right
or is Hardin right?

22:29.540 --> 22:34.299
Well, that's giving up a tremendous
legal advantage

22:34.300 --> 22:37.300
that all defendants have
and should have.

22:37.301 --> 22:40.740
You know, what we've basically built
into our system is the notion

22:40.741 --> 22:44.501
that we want to have guilt proven
beyond reasonable doubt

22:44.502 --> 22:47.301
to avoid innocent people
going to prison.

22:47.302 --> 22:50.462
It's not perfect,
but that's the goal.

22:50.463 --> 22:55.902
And so, the real issue,
the real issue in this case,

22:55.903 --> 22:58.863
is not whether we have proven

22:58.864 --> 23:04.345
that Kathleen Peterson died
as a result of an accident.

23:05.905 --> 23:08.025
No. That's not our burden.

23:09.065 --> 23:12.746
The real issue,
the one that you need to focus on...

23:13.746 --> 23:18.546
..is whether the State has proven
beyond a reasonable doubt,

23:18.547 --> 23:22.986
with proof that fully satisfies
and entirely convinces you,

23:22.987 --> 23:26.307
that on the morning
of December 9th, 2001,

23:26.308 --> 23:31.307
Michael Peterson beat Kathleen
Peterson to death with a blow poke

23:31.308 --> 23:35.988
in that narrow stairway that
all of you saw just a few weeks ago.

23:35.989 --> 23:39.709
And what I want to do this morning
is to focus on

23:39.710 --> 23:43.230
the reasonable doubts in this case.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.550
The first reasonable doubt.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.110
The missing murder weapon
isn't missing

23:49.111 --> 23:51.271
and it wasn't used in a murder.

23:52.751 --> 23:55.432
It doesn't get much simpler
than that, does it?

23:56.432 --> 23:59.232
The State contended
in its opening statement...

24:00.633 --> 24:05.152
..that they would prove
that the blow poke was,

24:05.153 --> 24:08.993
as Mr Hardin put it,
mysteriously missing.

24:08.994 --> 24:12.313
Why was this blow poke
so crucial to their case?

24:12.314 --> 24:15.154
You actually heard it
from Mr Hardin in his opening.

24:15.155 --> 24:19.315
He needed something that was light
enough to cause the lacerations...

24:20.355 --> 24:24.276
..but not so heavy
as to fracture the skull.

24:26.076 --> 24:28.356
So he was sort of
walking a tightrope.

24:28.357 --> 24:32.637
And this was the tightrope
he was walking.

24:35.998 --> 24:38.077
Reasonable doubt number two.

24:38.078 --> 24:39.997
There is no credible motive

24:39.998 --> 24:44.239
and you don't just decide
to kill your wife for no reason.

24:45.519 --> 24:50.559
In opening statements, I told you
all that everyone who knew

24:50.560 --> 24:54.119
Kathleen and Michael Peterson knew

24:54.120 --> 24:57.760
that they were very much in love
and happy.

24:57.761 --> 25:01.040
And in fact, when Candace Zamperini

25:01.041 --> 25:04.481
spoke to the police
in December 2001,

25:04.482 --> 25:07.041
she used the term soul mate.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.241
And when she testified here,

25:09.242 --> 25:15.242
you didn't hear her say anything bad
about the relationship.

25:15.243 --> 25:18.723
Sometimes, the absence of evidence
speaks louder

25:18.724 --> 25:21.603
than anything
that a defendant could produce.

25:21.604 --> 25:26.245
If there was a single witness,
one, anywhere...

25:27.325 --> 25:32.686
..who could say one bad thing
about their relationship...

25:33.886 --> 25:36.685
..you know
you would have heard it.

25:36.686 --> 25:39.166
No-one came in and testified -

25:39.167 --> 25:43.206
not Caitlin, who's sat here
for most of the trial.

25:43.207 --> 25:45.928
Not any of Kathleen's co-workers.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.608
Not any of Kathleen's friends.

25:50.608 --> 25:53.368
Reasonable doubt number three.

25:53.369 --> 26:00.209
There is one thing that everyone
who went to the scene of 1810 Cedar

26:00.210 --> 26:03.930
on the night
of December 9th agrees on.

26:05.370 --> 26:11.530
Michael Peterson was in profound,
deep shock and grief

26:11.531 --> 26:13.812
over Kathleen's death.

26:17.452 --> 26:21.332
The words you speak
when you reach your verdict

26:21.333 --> 26:24.012
will be the most important words

26:24.013 --> 26:27.414
that Michael Peterson
and his family...

26:28.614 --> 26:33.054
..will ever, ever, ever
hear in their lives.

26:35.535 --> 26:41.735
And the words that Michael Peterson
spoke on December 9th, 2001,

26:41.736 --> 26:45.776
when he called 911...

26:47.697 --> 26:52.257
..should guide your verdict
as you deliberate it.

26:59.098 --> 27:03.058
'911, what's your emergency?
1810 Cedar Street, please.

27:03.059 --> 27:06.258
'What's wrong? My wife's had
an accident, she's still breathing.

27:06.259 --> 27:08.739
'What kind of accident?
She fell down the stairs.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.419
'She's still breathing, please!

27:10.420 --> 27:12.579
'Is she conscious? What?
Is she conscious?

27:12.580 --> 27:13.739
'No, she's unconscious.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.940
'How many stairs did she fall down?
Hello? How many stairs? Stairs?

27:17.941 --> 27:22.781
'How many stairs? I don't know.
Calm down, sir.

27:22.782 --> 27:25.501
'Calm down. Oh, er... 15, 20,
I don't know.

27:25.502 --> 27:28.141
'Please, get somebody here
right away, please!

27:28.142 --> 27:31.902
'Somebody is despatched in an
ambulance while I ask you questions.

27:31.903 --> 27:34.782
'It's... in Forest Hills. OK?

27:34.783 --> 27:40.623
'Please, please! Sir, somebody else
is despatching the ambulance.

27:40.624 --> 27:43.264
'OK, is she awake now?

27:43.265 --> 27:44.825
'Hello?

27:47.425 --> 27:48.785
'Hello?'

27:51.706 --> 27:55.466
You know, I think one of
the most strange comments...

27:56.746 --> 28:00.986
..and actually a very true comment,
was what Candace said on the stand

28:00.987 --> 28:05.268
when she said, "I don't know
who that Michael Peterson is."

28:07.748 --> 28:12.028
You know... I don't know
who that person is either

28:12.029 --> 28:13.708
who has been on trial,

28:13.709 --> 28:17.910
hearing all of these things and
listening to all of these stories.

28:19.110 --> 28:24.630
These incredible things. I don't
know who that person is either.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.591
But it isn't me, I know that.

28:30.191 --> 28:31.752
I am who I am.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.111
And I can live with that.

28:35.112 --> 28:36.911
And I told you in the beginning,

28:36.912 --> 28:41.952
I've never been terribly concerned
what other people think,

28:41.953 --> 28:44.912
and I know that comes across
as an arrogance,

28:44.913 --> 28:49.793
but I think that a lot of it
has to do with peace,

28:49.794 --> 28:54.834
that I have never really
ever sought to hurt anybody.

28:54.835 --> 28:59.354
Yes, I've done some bad things,
yes, I've certainly inadvertently

28:59.355 --> 29:02.995
hurt people and I haven't led
the most exemplary life.

29:02.996 --> 29:08.156
But I've never consciously
gone out to hurt anybody.

29:08.157 --> 29:13.437
And I can,
in a very loose definition...

29:14.638 --> 29:16.518
..live at peace with myself.

29:17.558 --> 29:19.758
And if you can do that...

29:21.519 --> 29:25.159
..it really doesn't make
any difference where that is.

29:26.839 --> 29:28.920
So... I'll just...

29:30.080 --> 29:33.199
..probably just
not be any different

29:33.200 --> 29:36.360
on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday

29:36.361 --> 29:40.280
if I come back to this house
or if I go somewhere else,

29:40.281 --> 29:43.841
it's not going to change who I am

29:43.842 --> 29:46.202
and who... when I am.

29:47.362 --> 29:49.482
It will be still me.

29:49.483 --> 29:53.803
And the trappings certainly
could be very, very different.

29:55.003 --> 29:58.203
The environment certainly
could be very different.

29:58.204 --> 29:59.964
But that's just...

30:02.445 --> 30:04.245
..environment.

30:12.646 --> 30:16.566
Members of the jury, all of
the evidence has been presented,

30:16.567 --> 30:21.086
it is now your duty to decide from
this evidence what the facts are.

30:21.087 --> 30:25.167
The defendant has been charged
with first-degree murder.

30:25.168 --> 30:28.207
Under the law
and the evidence in this case,

30:28.208 --> 30:33.088
it is your duty to return
one of the following verdicts.

30:33.089 --> 30:36.408
One - guilty of first-degree murder

30:36.409 --> 30:39.489
or... two - not guilty.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.929
Take the jury
to the deliberation room

30:41.930 --> 30:46.251
and once you get the verdict sheet,
you can begin your deliberations.

31:05.814 --> 31:07.733
LAUGHTER

31:07.734 --> 31:12.054
That was scary. That was so funny.
Give them something to film.

31:12.055 --> 31:15.414
Leather... Dad!
Some women, Germans...

31:15.415 --> 31:21.495
How far away? Can I come look
at it when you go? Yes.

31:21.496 --> 31:23.695
Yes, absolutely.

31:23.696 --> 31:25.616
Absolutely, absolutely.

31:30.697 --> 31:33.937
Do you still... I mean, you've been
practising law for 28 years,

31:33.938 --> 31:36.817
do you still get butterflies
in your stomach?

31:36.818 --> 31:38.178
Um...

31:39.979 --> 31:44.378
Butterflies may not be quite the
right word, I still feel anxious.

31:44.379 --> 31:47.900
I think I've gotten better at...

31:48.980 --> 31:51.179
..putting it out of my mind
while I'm waiting,

31:51.180 --> 31:53.860
but when the knock comes
on the door,

31:53.861 --> 31:57.060
and they say they've reached
a verdict, that's when...

31:57.061 --> 31:59.620
butterflies would probably be
an understatement,

31:59.621 --> 32:04.341
it's more like bats and birds and
all kinds of things floating around.

32:04.342 --> 32:07.141
How about for your client,
for Mike Peterson?

32:07.142 --> 32:09.342
This is going to be
a tough time too.

32:09.343 --> 32:12.702
He needs his space and he needs
to be with his family

32:12.703 --> 32:16.143
and he needs to be with his kids,
and that's...

32:16.144 --> 32:19.063
he doesn't need me,
he needs the people

32:19.064 --> 32:23.144
who have supported him
and loved him his whole life.

32:23.145 --> 32:24.905
Hand me my wine, will you?

32:27.665 --> 32:29.866
Go ahead. Thanks very much.

32:31.146 --> 32:33.225
Enjoy it, it could be your last.

32:33.226 --> 32:35.787
THEY LAUGH

32:37.507 --> 32:40.346
I'll take a bottle with me
to court tomorrow. You'd better.

32:40.347 --> 32:43.387
It can go with all the other ones
there. What about the...?

32:43.388 --> 32:47.667
My entire bar in evidence, right?
Have you got the cyanide capsule?

32:47.668 --> 32:50.068
You're going out like...
A cyanide capsule.

32:50.069 --> 32:53.429
Was it Himmler or...?
Goring. Goring. That's right.

32:55.629 --> 32:58.789
Everybody, all the lawyers are
handicapping this thing,

32:58.790 --> 33:02.309
so there's really hardly any
possibility of a conviction.

33:02.310 --> 33:04.670
They're either talking about
an acquittal

33:04.671 --> 33:06.750
or they're talking about
a hung jury.

33:06.751 --> 33:10.470
Even Tom today told me that
he expects an acquittal tomorrow

33:10.471 --> 33:13.751
and he said, you know,
if it goes beyond Wednesday...

33:13.752 --> 33:18.232
PHONE RINGS
..then we might be thinking
a hung jury.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.672
Nobody's thinking a conviction here.

33:20.673 --> 33:23.352
That is in fact what I wanted
to talk to you about.

33:23.353 --> 33:28.153
And that is, you know, I always tell
my clients, you've got a 10% chance

33:28.154 --> 33:32.674
of losing the case or 80% chance,
50-50 or whatever.

33:32.675 --> 33:37.674
You know, I handicap this thing
extremely low, extremely low.

33:37.675 --> 33:41.395
But on the other hand, lightning
strikes, you just never know.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.875
Twice sometimes. Yeah.

33:43.876 --> 33:46.197
I almost hope they believe that.

33:48.197 --> 33:50.876
But anyway, in the event,
in the unlikely event,

33:50.877 --> 33:53.077
there will not be time to talk
right away

33:53.078 --> 33:55.317
because they'll just take you
right away.

33:55.318 --> 33:57.877
There'll be time later,
in the evening we can talk,

33:57.878 --> 34:01.798
just like when you were in jail
for that month in December.

34:01.799 --> 34:05.078
But it was a little bit different,
you know, because we all got ready

34:05.079 --> 34:08.799
and took you down to the jail
and we had a lot of time to talk.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.359
Um... but I am convinced,

34:12.360 --> 34:15.639
especially after hearing
the jury instructions today,

34:15.641 --> 34:19.159
that this judge has committed
prejudicial error already.

34:19.161 --> 34:22.321
Really? Well, that Ratliff stuff
should never have come in.

34:22.322 --> 34:26.281
Nobody I've talked to can believe
that that evidence was admitted.

34:26.282 --> 34:29.322
It's highly prejudicial,
highly prejudicial.

34:29.322 --> 34:32.522
So I think it's reversible,
and easily reversible,

34:32.523 --> 34:36.723
so what I wanted to tell you, we
won't have time to talk tomorrow,

34:36.724 --> 34:40.684
you know, don't panic,
you'll spend a year in prison.

34:42.405 --> 34:44.885
But you can do that
standing on your head.

34:46.085 --> 34:49.885
But that's the important thing to
keep in mind. The game is not over.

34:49.886 --> 34:51.885
So you're telling me to...

34:51.886 --> 34:55.047
Don't bolt for the door downstairs.
Don't bolt for the door.

34:56.527 --> 34:57.967
OK, all right.

34:59.087 --> 35:01.487
Well, just... I've told...

35:05.728 --> 35:08.247
My affairs are perfectly in order.

35:08.248 --> 35:11.329
You know, Todd knows what to do.
Yeah, OK.

35:12.409 --> 35:16.129
We've told him, you know...
More powers of attorney.

35:16.130 --> 35:19.689
I'm going to take off my watch
and just have 100

35:19.690 --> 35:22.610
and we'll stick them in my pants
and I'll... Yeah.

35:23.971 --> 35:28.490
But mostly, the main thing,
I want the kids removed from it,

35:28.491 --> 35:32.331
I want them taken out of here
and this environment

35:32.332 --> 35:37.132
and I want them to go on,
I mean, just absolutely go on.

35:37.133 --> 35:42.412
I trust you, Jack, to take care of
everything, take care of my kids.

35:42.413 --> 35:46.773
Yeah. Cos they'll be a mess.
They will be a wreck.

35:46.774 --> 35:50.133
Yeah, I know, I think that's right.
Oh, they will be a wreck.

35:50.134 --> 35:52.174
They'll just be destroyed.

35:52.175 --> 35:56.055
Margaret and Martha will be...
Ah, they'll just be... Yeah.

35:58.296 --> 35:59.815
So, bring 'em to Vegas.

35:59.816 --> 36:03.135
We'll send them up there.
Margaret tried that...

36:03.136 --> 36:06.496
Listen, she's got the genes, so...

36:06.497 --> 36:08.656
That's fine. Yeah.

36:08.657 --> 36:11.096
I don't think it's going to
happen tomorrow anyway.

36:11.097 --> 36:13.177
I don't think it's going
to happen either.

36:13.178 --> 36:16.257
I don't even think we'll get a
verdict tomorrow, I'd be surprised.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.017
But not terribly surprised.

36:18.018 --> 36:20.618
I can deal with whatever happens.

36:20.619 --> 36:26.939
Believe me, I was saying before,
that it's all up here, basically.

36:26.940 --> 36:30.539
You know, Milton. "Make a heaven of
our hell, a hell of our heaven."

36:30.540 --> 36:32.260
And I can...

36:33.461 --> 36:36.381
I can deal with it,
I absolutely can.

38:11.755 --> 38:15.714
It's too terrifying,
it would be like losing everything.

38:15.715 --> 38:17.755
I mean, we still have the family,

38:17.756 --> 38:19.635
but we just lost our mother,

38:19.636 --> 38:23.595
we lost our sister, and to lose
our dad, who's basically...

38:23.596 --> 38:25.876
I mean, he's the foundation
of the family.

38:25.877 --> 38:29.156
He is holding us together, he's
the strongest person in this family

38:29.157 --> 38:30.596
and...

38:30.597 --> 38:32.757
I wouldn't...

38:32.758 --> 38:36.397
I don't think
I'd be able to survive without him.

38:36.398 --> 38:40.318
I don't think I can... I can't
really think about it too much

38:40.319 --> 38:44.718
because it will just send me
in too much of a depression.

38:44.719 --> 38:48.799
I couldn't... I couldn't live my life
without my dad.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.200
People have told me,
some of my friends have been like,

38:52.201 --> 38:55.880
"You know, Margaret, you should
really plan just in case."

38:55.881 --> 39:01.881
And there's not been one single time
where I could believe,

39:01.882 --> 39:03.881
no matter how corrupt any system is,

39:03.882 --> 39:07.082
I could believe that they could come
with a guilty verdict.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.763
I mean, it won't happen.

39:29.486 --> 39:32.566
COURT CLERK MAKES ANNOUNCEMENT

39:33.686 --> 39:37.086
All right, now I'm going to bring
the jury in,

39:37.087 --> 39:39.806
they're going to tell me
what their verdict is

39:39.807 --> 39:42.167
and I'm going to need
order in the court,

39:42.168 --> 39:44.967
getting this jury out of here
and doing the things

39:44.968 --> 39:46.687
that I'm going to have to do,

39:46.688 --> 39:48.448
so, to the members of the public,

39:48.449 --> 39:50.848
if you think you're going
to have difficulty

39:50.849 --> 39:52.768
accepting the jury's verdict

39:52.769 --> 39:56.409
and you're going to make noise
or do something else disruptive

39:56.410 --> 39:57.769
in the courtroom,

39:57.770 --> 40:03.050
I'm going to give you an opportunity
to leave right now.

40:03.051 --> 40:07.930
Because if you disrupt my courtroom,
while I'm doing this,

40:07.931 --> 40:11.611
and you cause a scene,
I'm going to have you arrested.

40:11.612 --> 40:15.973
Mr Deputy, bring the jury in. Tell
them to bring all their belongings.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.733
This way, please.

40:43.977 --> 40:47.296
All right, Ms Foreperson,
I'm going to ask you some questions.

40:47.297 --> 40:49.416
Has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict

40:49.417 --> 40:51.737
on the issue that was submitted
to you? Yes.

40:51.738 --> 40:55.577
Have you marked the appropriate
spaces on the verdict sheet? Yes.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.298
Have you signed your name
and printed your name? Yes.

40:58.299 --> 41:01.179
All right, if you will give that
sheet to the deputy, please.

41:15.341 --> 41:18.140
All right, Ms Clerk,
if you will take the verdict.

41:18.141 --> 41:19.941
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

41:19.942 --> 41:22.021
you have returned
the following verdict.

41:22.022 --> 41:25.101
State of North Carolina
versus Michael Iver Peterson,

41:25.102 --> 41:29.262
file number 01 CRS 24821.

41:29.263 --> 41:33.023
"We, the 12 members of the jury,
unanimously find the defendant

41:33.024 --> 41:35.263
"to be guilty of
first-degree murder,

41:35.264 --> 41:37.903
"this the 10th day of October 2003,"

41:37.904 --> 41:41.384
signed by foreperson,
Kristen Jones.

41:41.385 --> 41:43.584
Is this your verdict,
so say you all?

41:43.585 --> 41:45.144
Yes.

41:45.145 --> 41:47.705
All right, Ms Clerk,
if you will call the jury.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.665
Miss Jones, you as foreperson
have returned for your verdict

41:50.666 --> 41:53.866
that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

41:53.867 --> 41:57.266
Is this your verdict and do you
still assent thereto? Yes.

41:57.267 --> 41:58.346
Thank you.

41:58.347 --> 42:01.467
Junior number one, Mr Harrison,
if you please stand.

42:01.468 --> 42:04.307
Mr Harrison, your foreperson
has returned for your verdict

42:04.308 --> 42:07.067
that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

42:07.068 --> 42:09.748
Is this your verdict
and do you still assent thereto?

42:09.749 --> 42:10.948
Yes. Thank you.

42:10.949 --> 42:14.309
Junior number two, Mr Higgins,
will you please stand?

42:14.310 --> 42:16.909
Mr Higgins, your foreperson
has returned for your verdict

42:16.910 --> 42:19.669
that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.430
Is this in your verdict
and do you still assent thereto?

42:22.431 --> 42:24.070
Yes. Thank you.

42:24.071 --> 42:27.910
Juror number four, Miss Blackwell,
if you please stand.

42:27.911 --> 42:30.991
Miss Blackwell, your foreperson
has returned for you verdict

42:30.992 --> 42:33.671
that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

42:33.672 --> 42:36.752
Is this your verdict
and do you still assent thereto?

42:36.753 --> 42:38.152
Yes. Thank you.

42:38.153 --> 42:41.712
Juror number five,
will you please stand?

42:41.713 --> 42:45.193
Your foreperson has returned
for your verdict

42:45.194 --> 42:47.833
that the defendant is guilty of
first-degree murder.

42:47.834 --> 42:50.794
Is this your verdict
and do you still assent thereto?

42:50.795 --> 42:52.274
Yes. Thank you.

42:52.275 --> 42:54.554
Juror number 12, Mr Hall.

42:54.555 --> 42:57.355
Mr Hall, your foreperson
has returned for your verdict

42:57.356 --> 42:59.995
that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

42:59.996 --> 43:02.515
Is this your verdict
and do you still assent thereto?

43:02.516 --> 43:04.116
Yes. Thank you.

43:04.117 --> 43:07.036
All right. Ms Court Recorder
of the court finds

43:07.037 --> 43:11.957
a unanimous jury verdict, orders
that it be recorded by the clerk.

43:11.958 --> 43:15.718
Mr Deputy, you take the jury
to your assigned place.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.881
Mr Hardin, do you wish to be heard
at all? Mr Rudolf?

43:41.882 --> 43:44.842
Judge, I don't think that
the court has any discretion

43:44.843 --> 43:49.322
with regard to sentencing. Obviously
we will be filing notice of appeal.

43:49.323 --> 43:52.603
But with regard to sentencing,
we don't wish to be heard.

43:52.604 --> 43:55.723
All right, then, Mr Peterson,
if you'll stand where you are,

43:55.724 --> 43:59.044
is there anything you want to say
before the court imposes judgment?

43:59.045 --> 44:00.325
I would.

44:04.525 --> 44:06.686
It's OK. It's OK.

44:08.526 --> 44:09.926
It's OK.

44:11.006 --> 44:14.046
All right, then, Ms Clerk,
the defendant is imprisoned

44:14.047 --> 44:16.726
in the North Carolina
Department of Corrections

44:16.727 --> 44:20.448
for the remainder of his natural
life without the benefit of parole.

44:21.888 --> 44:24.967
Mr Rudolf, do you wish
to appeal at this time

44:24.968 --> 44:26.928
or are you going
to think about it?

44:26.929 --> 44:28.649
We'll appeal later. All right, sir.

45:08.535 --> 45:09.775
All stand.

45:58.982 --> 46:02.982
Walk him right across here. Second
door? Yes, sir. Go right ahead.

46:06.863 --> 46:09.703
Over here, come here, this way.

47:14.473 --> 47:18.072
If there's not at least
reasonable doubt in this case,

47:18.073 --> 47:20.232
at least reasonable doubt,

47:20.233 --> 47:23.514
then I don't understand
what I'm doing.

47:25.074 --> 47:29.154
And so, when the jury came in,
it didn't just disappoint me,

47:29.155 --> 47:33.675
it shook the foundations
of my beliefs.

47:34.836 --> 47:38.316
It shook the foundations of
my beliefs in the justice system...

47:40.236 --> 47:42.557
..in human beings...

47:44.197 --> 47:46.117
..in my own abilities...

47:47.877 --> 47:49.518
..in, um...

47:50.718 --> 47:52.238
..my judgment...

47:56.519 --> 47:58.238
..in my sense of reality.

47:58.239 --> 48:04.480
I mean, it didn't just surprise me,
it truly stunned me.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.880
It... it just blew me away

48:10.881 --> 48:13.761
emotionally and psychologically.
