WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.471
RUSH: This is what Destiny
 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.505 --> 00:08.141
YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.176 --> 00:11.712
Are we done?
 We'll never be done.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.214
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.249
YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.283 --> 00:16.484
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.886
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.421
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.256
(SNARLS)

00:22.290 --> 00:23.991
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.893
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:25.926 --> 00:27.728
Lucian Alliance, they're
 coming to take Destiny.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.430
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is gonna end if we wait.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.699
YOUNG: I'm not surrendering
 this ship.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.267
RUSH: I've managed to
 find a clue

00:33.301 --> 00:35.403
which may
 give us control of
 this ship once and for all.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.838
It's the number
 of chromosomes
 in the human DNA.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.840
All we have to do now
 is run through the
 variations.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.042
I was never your
 conscience, Nicholas.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.377
I haven't
 forgotten you, Gloria.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.458
DANNIC: There can only be
 one commander, and
 Kiva's dead.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.193
What are we doing
 to get the ship back?

00:59.227 --> 01:00.228
(GUNSHOTS)

01:08.102 --> 01:09.103
(SCREAMING)

01:13.307 --> 01:14.142
They're going to kill me.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.085
PARK: I thought you were
 going to get some sleep.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.088
Yeah, so did I.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.296
What's going on
here, then?

01:35.329 --> 01:38.266
PARK: Some sort of crash.
 The interface is frozen.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.733
Yeah? Why didn't you
 call me?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.170
Well, I was going
 to try a restart first.
 That's fixed it in the past.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.471
(BEEPING)

01:47.040 --> 01:49.410
What did you just do?
 Seems I fixed the problem.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.313
Yeah, I can see that. How?
 Good night, Dr. Park.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.081
Glad to see you have
 everything well in hand.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.916
Wait, where are you going?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.852
For a walk. You get into
 trouble next time, call me.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.364
(LOUD THUD)

03:38.619 --> 03:41.589
GLORIA: You're not going to
tell anyone, are you?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.293
Gloria.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.960
Your program
finally worked.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.533
Unlocked the master code.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.470
You found the keys
to controlling all of
 Destiny's systems, everything.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.011
And you're not going
 to tell anyone, are you?

04:18.759 --> 04:22.430
Ancient legend
 said the address led
 to great understanding.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.432
It could make you as
 powerful as the Gods.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.667
Which Gods?

04:29.136 --> 04:33.941
Don't ask me. I assume
 it meant God-like power.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.576
Like the
 ascended Ancients.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.746
If you could control
 time and space...

04:38.779 --> 04:43.083
Wait. You think that
 Desti is capable of that?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.953
I don't know.
 That's what the legend said.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.693
You asked me
 why the Lucian Alliance
 wanted the ship so badly.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.496
Why are you here?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.770
I'm trying
 to understand
 your perspective.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.640
You really
 want me to go over
 the last 12 or 13 years?

05:06.674 --> 05:09.309
The how and the why
 of the Lucian Alliance?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.614
They're warlords.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.316
On my home planet,
 they would burn our farms,

05:16.350 --> 05:20.020
so we had nothing to eat
but the food they supplied.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.989
They told our teachers
 what to teach.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.492
Children
 were given weapons
 and trained to fight.

05:26.494 --> 05:30.464
Two years ago,
 I was taken by
 a gang at gunpoint

05:30.498 --> 05:33.066
and told if I didn't
 join the Alliance Guard

05:33.100 --> 05:35.002
my family was
 going to be murdered.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.010
So, you're saying that you
 had no choice in any of this?

05:47.381 --> 05:49.016
We're not getting
 enough food.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.685
None of us are.

05:51.719 --> 05:55.489
We haven't
 been able to replenish
 our supplies in some time.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.024
You're saying
 we could all starve?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.728
Yes.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.263
What are you going to do
 with us?

06:03.296 --> 06:06.333
You can't keep us locked
 in that hold forever.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.268
That hasn't been
 determined yet.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.541
Colonel Young, he's going
 to make that decision?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.845
I will have a say.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.347
Some of us have
 been co-operative.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.516
Yes, you have.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.552
There is more we can do.

06:24.585 --> 06:28.689
There are those among us
 who are no danger to you.

06:28.722 --> 06:32.793
Please, give us a chance
 to prove it to you.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.571
(GROANING)

06:51.278 --> 06:52.079
VARRO: What are they
 going to do with us?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.249
They didn't tell me
 anything. I'm a traitor.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.553
You know Young.
 What will he do?

06:59.587 --> 07:02.490
I used to know him.
Trust me, he's changed.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.837
You've got to
be kidding me.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.742
It's hardly worth
 sitting down.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.745
DUNNING: Yeah, maybe we
 shouldn't be giving our
 rations to the enemy.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.515
They're human beings.
 They have rights.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.249
How we treat
 prisoners of war

07:29.282 --> 07:31.619
says everything about us
 as a moral and civil society.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.254
(CHUCKLES)

07:34.287 --> 07:35.823
Which pamphlet
 did you get that from?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.827
It's what I believe.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.329
I don't care
 how secure they are.
 I can't sleep knowing

07:42.362 --> 07:44.197
there's a room full
 of people on this ship

07:44.231 --> 07:45.699
who would kill me
 first chance they got.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.173
You know,
 HR was my job on Icarus.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.475
And psych evals are
 T.J.'s responsibility.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.377
She's going to
 need some time.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.547
It's going to be
 hard enough for her to
 fulfill her duties as medic.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.414
Great. Fine. Thanks.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.689
The IOA reports
our conflict with
the Lucian Alliance

08:08.722 --> 08:11.625
in the Milky Way
is escalating.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.227
Intel suggests they may be
 planning an attack on Earth.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.897
Have you learned anything
 from the prisoners?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.799
Not yet.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.467
It would help if
 I could reassure them

08:20.500 --> 08:22.302
that we're not
 just going to pump
 them for information

08:22.335 --> 08:23.737
and then dump them
 on the next planet.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.405
Really?

08:25.438 --> 08:27.808
Well, they dumped us
 on a planet to die.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.343
Is everyone on board
 willing to starve for them?

08:30.377 --> 08:31.979
We haven't come to
 that point yet...

08:32.011 --> 08:35.649
How ugly
 are you willing to
 let this get, Camile?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.818
I'm just asking because
I don't think this has
anything to do

08:37.851 --> 08:39.820
with the proper treatment
 of POWs, and you know it.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.255
They tried to kill us,

08:42.289 --> 08:43.823
and we do not have
 the capability to hold

08:43.857 --> 08:45.926
onto these prisoners
 over the long haul.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
They're not all dangerous.
 If you would just read
 my report...

08:47.795 --> 08:50.530
"I was just following orders"
 is a claim that I've
 heard before.

08:50.564 --> 08:54.668
People will say anything
to save themselves, Camile.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.937
So we're just
 going to leave them on
 the next viable planet

08:56.970 --> 08:57.805
and then wash
 our hands of it?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.775
Let's hope
 we find a viable planet.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.683
You thought this was
 going to be easier,
 didn't you?

09:09.717 --> 09:12.252
You thought all
 you'd need to do
 was turn the key.

09:12.285 --> 09:16.690
This ship,
 its systems were designed
 to be run by an entire crew.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.558
Well, you have a crew.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.728
Yeah, a crew that knows
what they're doing.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.698
This is
 what you wanted.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.034
You know, the Ancients,

09:27.067 --> 09:28.902
they never
 intended Destiny
 to operate on its own.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.913
They were supposed to
 come here, in person.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.316
There was a point
 to this mission.
 There had to be.

09:43.350 --> 09:47.921
And yet, the first thing
 you did was turn the
 autopilot system back on.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.457
Until I can be sure
 I know how to use
 each function.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.292
I wouldn't want to stop
 accidentally in range of

09:52.325 --> 09:54.327
another binary pulsar,
 would I?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.829
Good plan.

09:55.863 --> 10:00.467
You see, right now,
 I'm trying to understand

10:00.500 --> 10:02.836
why Destiny stops at
 some planets and
 not others.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.437
Maybe they're just
 rest stops.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.773
Designed to
 let people get out,

10:05.806 --> 10:08.842
stretch their legs,
smell the roses,

10:08.876 --> 10:13.280
but in the grand scheme of
 Destiny's greater mission,
 not very important.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.649
Certainly environments can
 change significantly
 through the years,

10:15.683 --> 10:17.517
become dangerous, even.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.619
But that would mean
 Destiny's got some
 kind of

10:19.653 --> 10:22.089
real-time subspace link
to the gates.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.491
And look, here,
 this planet we're approaching,

10:24.524 --> 10:26.493
different
 classification entirely,

10:26.526 --> 10:29.529
not merely locked out,
 but it seems to be
 non-functional.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.798
So it seems.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.367
So very helpful.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.338
Do you remember the long walks
 we used to take in the gardens
 back home?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.474
Wherever we were,

10:41.508 --> 10:43.643
we'd always find
 a quiet place to
 call our own.

10:43.677 --> 10:46.847
That's it.
 We need food now.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.382
This planet
 we're approaching
 should be rich in plant life.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.820
A big red X
 generally means "Danger,
 don't go there," doesn't it?

10:58.658 --> 11:02.730
Is this
 your only purpose,
 to question my actions?

11:02.763 --> 11:05.665
So, what are you
 going to do?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.768
Oh, well, I'll take
 that as a yes, then.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.882
ELI: There has to be a reason
 the Destiny dropped out.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.152
RUSH: There is.
 Where have you been?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.155
Busy. We're in range of
a planet that looks like
it may have food and water.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.890
Riley says
there are no gates.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.091
Shuttle range.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.492
(SYSTEM BLEEPS)

11:32.525 --> 11:34.828
Wow, look at that.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.430
Well, how does Destiny
 have data on a planet
 with no gate on it?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.000
Well, there is a gate on it.
 It appears to be
 non-functioning.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.503
So Destiny just happened to
 drop out close enough for
 us to use the shuttle?

11:43.536 --> 11:45.072
That's convenient...
 Well, it's not magic.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
As I've been doing
 all along,

11:48.208 --> 11:51.078
I've been
 telling Destiny any way I can
 how short of resources we are.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.545
Well, we'll send a team.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.750
Okay, I suggest we
land close to the gate,

11:56.784 --> 11:59.519
try and determine
 why it's not working,
 maybe even repair it.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.122
Shuttle trip will
 take just under an hour.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.424
Less than seven hours
total is not much time.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.093
However, if we can
 get the gate operational,

12:06.126 --> 12:08.962
we'll be able to transport
 a lot more food and water
 than the shuttle.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.531
Two gates
 cannot dial each other
 in this close a proximity.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.035
This planet may well be
in range the next time
we drop out of FTL.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.138
If we can get the gate active,
 we might be able to dial back
 down the line.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.007
You want to go?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.076
No, no,
I should stay here.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.444
Oh, what's more
 important right now...

12:24.477 --> 12:26.146
Well, there's a number
of systems that's been
malfunctioning of late.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.915
I'm working on those,
 actually.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.488
Sir.
YOUNG: T.J.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.425
I'm almost ready to go.
 Just packing up my kit.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.861
You...

12:41.929 --> 12:44.064
You sure?

12:44.097 --> 12:48.735
Well, I'll admit
 I'm not 100%, but
 we're low on medicinals,

12:48.768 --> 12:50.137
and I know we'll only be
 there a few hours,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.139
so I should at least
 take a look around.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.740
I'll take it easy.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.742
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
You know,
 I wanted to make
 sure you're okay.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.817
Good luck down there.
 Thanks.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.462
Dr. Rush has pinpointed the
Stargate's position on
the surface,

13:15.495 --> 13:17.764
and I've plotted
 a course.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.999
Colonel Young,
 this is Scott.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.601
All systems are go.
 We are ready for take-off.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.702
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.137
Roger that.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.216
I'm worried
about you,
Nicholas.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.118
Yeah, so am I.
 I've got work to do,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.287
and I can't seem
 to leave myself alone.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.655
FRANKLIN:
 You're missing things.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.198
Dr. Franklin.

13:51.231 --> 13:55.802
It's too much for one person.
 I don't care how smart
 you are.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.072
Okay, so tell me.
 What am I missing?

13:59.106 --> 14:03.543
Well, for one,
 the data on the planet.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.145
It's extensive.
 What about it?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.147
You didn't notice
 the volcanic activity?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.883

 super-rotation?

14:17.757 --> 14:18.892
A few minutes away now.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.732
It'll be fine.
 They'll be fine.

14:25.765 --> 14:29.769
You've based
 your calculation on
 optimal structural integrity.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.105
I based it
 on the specs
 in the database.

14:32.139 --> 14:35.175
Which don't
 account for flaws
 that were developed over,

Yeah, I hear you.
 Go ahead.

You're about to enter an area
 of atmospheric super-rotation.

 that mean?

Well, I've done

 some excessive turbulence,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.905

wasn't built to handle.

 we made it through fine.

 we're going to be flying

we should be trying

 have to eventually.

 or you and Dr. Franklin
 are somehow

 with me.

 trying to do?

Figure out
 how to control how
 long Destiny stops

24:20.226 --> 24:21.928

 out of FTL.

 my mind, then.

There don't seem to
 be any Stargates coming up
 in Destiny's immediate path.

24:41.648 --> 24:45.184
Now, I'll have to stop this
ship soon or we're going
to be out of range

24:45.217 --> 24:46.786

the team's stranded on.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.788

 other gates in range,

you don't know how to explain
 to everyone else why the ship
 has stopped.

24:51.591 --> 24:55.962
Exactly. I can't just keep
 dropping in and out of FTL.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.398

the drives permanently.

 a minimum of four hours
 each time they're activated,

25:02.334 --> 25:05.805

 next time I drop out,

25:05.838 --> 25:07.273
I've got one
 last shot at this.

 take over this ship.

 worse all the time.
 He nearly just killed a man.

 caused the shuttle to crash.

There's no way
 to get him free?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.292
T.J. thinks
 the pressure
 from the wreckage

26:00.326 --> 26:02.228
is what's keeping him
 from bleeding out.

 and then getting shot.

 there's so much

 than us.

that I haven't told anyone?

28:03.449 --> 28:05.785
Sure. Who am I going to
tell, right?

28:11.758 --> 28:15.862

 stopped at that we thought
 was created by aliens?

it was a dream,

 they came and got me.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.887
and she's safe there.

It felt real.
 And I don't know
 how to explain it.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.709
or appropriate force will
 be used to maintain order.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.790
You know, I think
 I remember reading somewhere

29:51.824 --> 29:54.760
that a big enough explosion
close enough to a Stargate

29:54.793 --> 29:58.464
can detonate
the super-conductive
material that it's made of.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.800
The resulting explosion
can take a chunk out
of a planet.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.870
Well, it's not
 going to...

30:03.903 --> 30:05.471
It's not gonna be
 that big.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.274
You're sure?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.843
I... We don't have
 much of a choice,
 do we?

30:10.877 --> 30:14.146
It could take weeks
 to dig this thing out.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.581
Hopefully, the blast
 won't damage the gate.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.785
Do you want me to
 flip the switch or not?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.287
Yeah, yeah.
 Oh, yeah, sure...
 I'm flipping the switch.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.855
No, flip it already.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.893
Fire in the hole!

30:42.841 --> 30:43.842
That was pretty big.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.321
I used
 the communication stones.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.824
Okay. We'll just
 skip over the fact that
 I didn't authorize that.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.160
I have a short list.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.762
Based on intel provided
by both myself and
Camile Wray.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.664
You're being
ordered to keep

31:05.697 --> 31:08.534
a select number of
Lucian Alliance onboard
who may prove valuable.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.537
And if I don't,
 I assume you're
 going to tell me

31:11.570 --> 31:15.007
that you've been ordered
 to relieve me of my command.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.842
You think you've
 earned the trust of

31:16.875 --> 31:18.544
the men and women
 on this ship enough
 for them to follow you?

31:23.749 --> 31:26.352
Military personnel are still
 in the service of
 Stargate Command

31:26.385 --> 31:27.786
and expected
 to follow orders.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.130
Rush, this is Young.
 Where are you?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.869
It's less than
 three hours.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.705
The address to
 the planet came up,
 but it's still locked out.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.874
The strange thing is that
 there are no other
 planets in range.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.110
Nothing.
 Why'd we drop out?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.979
Exactly.
It doesn't
make sense.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.247
Suggestions?

31:55.281 --> 31:57.816
Try to bypass
 the lock-out.
 Dial anyway.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.653
It's a long shot.

32:01.687 --> 32:05.257
It's all we got. Rush,
 we're headed to the
 Gate Room.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.599
Where have you been?
 Engine Control Room.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.134
Doing what?

32:15.167 --> 32:18.804
Well, the FTL drive's still
suffering some effects from
the pulsar radiation,

32:18.837 --> 32:20.806
stopping at
 shorter intervals now,

32:20.839 --> 32:23.942
but regardless of whether
 we're in range of
 a planet or not.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.357
(GREER GRUNTING
 IN FRUSTRATION)

32:41.160 --> 32:42.294
(RUMBLING)

32:43.362 --> 32:44.863
You feel that?

32:49.168 --> 32:52.104
Hey, science guys,
 this thing is shaking.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.839
Someone's trying to dial in.
 Oh, clear the event horizon.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.279
The address is here.
 We've got Destiny!

33:00.312 --> 33:01.880
Shaking's stopped.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.983
ELI: Everyone, back away.
 I'm going to try to dial them.

33:05.684 --> 33:06.985
(DIALING)

33:09.721 --> 33:13.159
(CHUCKLING)
 It's working.
 It's working!

33:16.995 --> 33:19.031
Destiny, this is Scott.
 Permission to come aboard.

33:19.065 --> 33:19.898
Permission granted.

33:25.271 --> 33:28.174
Glad to see
 you guys are okay.
 Where are the others?

33:33.179 --> 33:35.013
Riley's not going
 to make it, sir.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.022
Sir.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.933
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

34:05.977 --> 34:07.779
(SOFTLY)
 Sir, I'm not just
 gonna let him die alone.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.815
Can you give me a minute?

34:10.449 --> 34:11.949
Yeah.
Thanks.

34:26.431 --> 34:27.433
Sorry, sir.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.036
You are a fine soldier,
 a good man.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.406
None of this
 is your fault.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.041
You know that.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.110
Don't stay on my account.
 Just make them leave.

34:39.145 --> 34:41.179
I don't want anyone to
 risk being stuck here.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.389
I'm not going to be around
 that much longer.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.324
What can I tell your family?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.929
Nothing really
 seems like enough.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.465
SCOTT:
 How long do you
 think he'll last?

35:37.068 --> 35:38.337
I don't know.

35:43.175 --> 35:46.111
How much time
until Destiny jumps?

35:46.144 --> 35:51.950
No, we're good. We're fine.
 I don't want you to
 worry, okay?

35:51.983 --> 35:53.985
I'd ask for your gun, but
 I don't want them to
 blame you.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.492
Sir...

36:03.229 --> 36:03.829
Please.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.100
I'm in pain.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.508
I'll get T.J.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.177
No.

36:20.045 --> 36:20.879
No!

36:27.386 --> 36:28.420
Please.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.030
(GASPING)

36:42.301 --> 36:43.435

37:02.721 --> 37:03.889
(SIGHS)

37:50.201 --> 37:51.169
(GASPING)

38:28.239 --> 38:29.375
He's gone.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.804
RILEY: You know,
 you'd figure being
 stranded on this ship

38:58.837 --> 39:00.439
in the middle of
 nowhere with a bunch

39:00.472 --> 39:07.312
of strangers
 would be the problem,
 but that isn't it exactly.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.346
GREER: To Riley.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.181
RILEY: It's not,
 it's not so much

39:10.215 --> 39:13.251
being out here as
 it is not being there.

39:15.687 --> 39:20.692
For the birthdays,
 the weddings, the funerals...

39:24.229 --> 39:28.099
Simple things like
 just taking your nephew
 to school on his first day,

39:29.735 --> 39:32.604
or even taking
 the dog for a walk.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.474
You now, just not...

39:38.710 --> 39:40.311
Not being there.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.670
There was nothing that
 could be done for Riley.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.775
Stalling Destiny any longer
 wouldn't have helped him.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.079
I know.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.114
Well, you think
I don't know?

40:17.583 --> 40:20.118
All of this is my fault.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.657
I was trying to save lives,
 all of our lives,
 not just my own.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.163
This database just confirms
 what I knew all along.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.470
This ship was named
 Destiny for a reason.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.564
(ACTIVATING CONSOLE)

41:12.370 --> 41:13.505
(BLEEPING)

41:34.926 --> 41:36.795
It must be
like Rush said,

41:36.828 --> 41:38.530
another short jump because
 of the radiation effect.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.665
(SENSORS BEEPING)

41:39.698 --> 41:40.832
Something just
came up on sensors.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.503
This is Rush. Meet me
 in the observation deck.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.708
I heard
the radio chatter.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.713
YOUNG:
 What's going on?

41:54.746 --> 41:57.883
There's an object out there.
 It's just coming into range.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.551
YOUNG:
 Well, what is it?

41:59.585 --> 42:02.688
VOLKER: We're not sure,
 but we're about to
 find out.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.725
We're headed
 straight for it.
