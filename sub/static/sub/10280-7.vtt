00:05.773 --> 00:08.676
Previously on E.R.:

00:08.709 --> 00:11.179
Congratulations, Mr. Nathan,
you're on call tomorrow night.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.680
32 hours straight.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.415
Labs on your baby.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.551
You two need
to figure this out.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.087
I was going to call first,
but Jody got sick.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.221
Who's Jody?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.622
You show up here with this girl

00:21.655 --> 00:22.756
who's barely out of her teens.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.525
Aren't you due back at the base?

00:24.558 --> 00:25.793
Not for a couple of weeks.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.261
Couple weeks?

00:34.768 --> 00:35.736
There it is--

00:35.769 --> 00:37.671
You can see his heart beat.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.840
You can tell it's a boy?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.509
Because I can't.

00:41.542 --> 00:45.079
No, it's just a...
figure of speech.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.748
It's just a pronoun.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.683
Are you hoping for a boy?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.485
Not particularly.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.255
I mean, a boy
would be nice

00:54.288 --> 00:56.524
but I...
I don't care.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.460
I don't even really
want to know.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.130
As long as
it's healthy, right?

01:04.632 --> 01:05.799
The rash of Lyme Disease
is called...

01:05.833 --> 01:07.368
Erythema migrans.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.702
Starts two to 20 days
after the tick bite.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.638
But it occurs in only 60
to 80 percent of cases.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.173
The hallmark
of the rash is...

01:12.206 --> 01:13.807
Erythmatous plaque.
Central clearing.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.809
Yeah. And the most common
neurological symptoms?

01:15.843 --> 01:16.877
BOTH:
Facial nerve palsy.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.646
Okay, all right, settle down.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.549
This is a teaching hospital,
not medical Jeopardy.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.716
Where are all the doctors?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.252
Who are you
looking for?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.520
Anyone. Carter, Weaver, Pratt;
I'm not picky.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.156
Uh, Carter's
stuck in triage

01:28.189 --> 01:30.491
Pratt's on at midnight,
and Weaver's MIA.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.392
What else is new?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.660
Kovac is sleeping.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.228
With who?
Thought he was suspended.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.263
He's back--
in the lounge.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.830
Hey, Harkins, you want to try

01:36.864 --> 01:39.367
casting a Colles' fracture
on a cranky old lady?

01:39.400 --> 01:40.668
Sure.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.904
What's the antibiotic
of choice?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.439
Doxycycline.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.775
Beth, this is Erin.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.710
She's going to be putting
your cast on.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.512
Beth?
Miss Garrison?

01:51.545 --> 01:52.913
I can't feel
a pulse.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.848
Oh, geez,
she's cold.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.184
She's dead?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.518
Bag her
on 15 liters.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.353
I need a crash cart
in here.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.522
Sister Beth?

02:01.555 --> 02:02.690
She was a nun?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.358
She is.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.859
Oh, boy.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.011 --> 02:59.380
Nathan?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.549
Nathan, let's shake a leg,
come on.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.251
Corday's
looking for you, man.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.585
Be right there.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.259
( heavy sigh )

03:17.765 --> 03:19.367
ER. Please hold.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.834
Think you could take
this somewhere else?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.403
Me? I need to
use the computer.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.537
Use one of the ones
over there.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.938
I don't want you
anywhere near me

03:24.972 --> 03:26.974
when God strikes you dead
for killing that nun.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.008
I didn't kill her.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.610
You didn't save her.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.612
She was an 87-year-old
woman in poor health.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.614
What, you only save
the healthy ones?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.015
She stroked out;
no one could foresee that.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.950
You don't have
to explain to me.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.553
I'm not the one
who's going to be
doing the judging.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.455
GSW ten minutes out.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.690
Wake up Kovac.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.957
Is Dr. Corday
still down here?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.526
John Doe;
found him down in the park

03:45.559 --> 03:47.328
altered, no signs
of serious trauma.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.896
Promise me you won't let them
near my face.

03:48.929 --> 03:49.997
Promise me you won't.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.031
Sir, what's
your name?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.500
Do you know
your name?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.767
They dropped
right out of the trees--

03:53.801 --> 03:55.002
right near my face.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.637
Nobody's
near your face, sir.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.971
Don't, don't let them near me!

03:58.005 --> 03:59.340
Whoa, whoa,
settle down.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.408
Okay, get five
of Haldol!

04:00.441 --> 04:01.008
Don't let them bite me!

04:01.041 --> 04:02.042
Relax... sir.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.344
We're trying
to help you!

04:03.377 --> 04:05.579
Security!
( screams )

04:05.613 --> 04:06.647
Stop it!

04:06.680 --> 04:08.816
It's the damn dyskenesias.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.351
Still need the Haldol?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.585
Yes.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.953
We got it.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.389
All right, put him
in soft restraints.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.524
You okay?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.757
Yeah, I'm
fine, thanks.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.927
Are you okay?

04:19.959 --> 04:22.530
Nothing that 12 hours
of sleep wouldn't cure.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.731
Okay, put him
on pulse ox

04:23.764 --> 04:25.799
two liters O2
by nasal cannula.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.837
Mineral oil on the
cotton balls should
act as a solvent.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.004
Come on in.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
Let's, uh,
get him inside.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.909
Make sure his nasal
passages stay clear.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.879
Hey, Jody,
what are you doing here?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.914
Um, I'm looking
for Eric.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.783
CARTER:
Abby.

04:42.816 --> 04:43.784
Hi, Abby.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.086
Hey, what's going on?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.555
Where's Eric?

04:47.588 --> 04:49.089
I was hoping you knew.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.924
What do you mean?

04:50.958 --> 04:51.959
I don't know.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.427
We were in Indiana

04:53.461 --> 04:55.396
on our way back
from my parents'...

04:55.429 --> 04:56.530
They had a fight.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.632
It was hardly
an argument.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.369
I mean, he got
really angry.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.504
I was just asking him
about us and our future

05:03.537 --> 05:04.505
and stuff like that

05:04.538 --> 05:05.573
and he took off.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.840
I didn't mean
to upset him.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.376
Maybe he went back to his base.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.677
No, I called.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.480
They said he's been U.A.
for two weeks.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.714
"U.A."?

05:13.747 --> 05:14.682
Unauthorized absence.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.716
Abby?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.952
Abby?
He's AWOL?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.120
Joel Seaton, 67--

05:20.153 --> 05:22.022
syncopal episode
at Navy Pier.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.393
Paramedics found
him dehydrated,
systolic of 90.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.694
Came up
with 500 saline.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.129
Joel was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer

05:29.162 --> 05:30.798
three months ago.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.701
What sort of treatment have
you been on, Mr. Seaton?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.769
Megace and gemzol.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.006
They said I might have a year
with the chemo.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.608
I'm not doing too good.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.676
He's had two stents
in his common bile duct

05:42.710 --> 05:44.011
to relieve the obstruction.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.479
It's probably clogged again

05:45.513 --> 05:46.647
which explains
the fever.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.748
How's your pain?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.617
Every night I go to bed

05:49.650 --> 05:52.720
I keep hoping
I'll wake up in the morning

05:52.753 --> 05:56.490
and I'll be better,
and the pain will be gone.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.529
Think there's a surgical
alternative that could help?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.663
I'm afraid not.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.932
What happens

06:04.965 --> 06:07.535
if you don't do anything?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.638
You'll get
more jaundiced.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.573
Slip into a coma

06:12.606 --> 06:13.741
from liver failure.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.609
Your kidneys will fail,
and your heart

06:15.643 --> 06:18.579
will stop from
a high potassium level.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.748
Is that a painful way to die?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.883
Not once you slip
into the coma.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.553
We can arrange for
home hospice care.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.120
A nurse will visit you
twice a day

06:27.154 --> 06:29.089
to give you the pain
medications you need.

06:29.122 --> 06:33.126
When my wife was living,
she used always to say

06:33.160 --> 06:36.096
I'd probably die
in my Barcalounger

06:36.129 --> 06:40.100
watching
the football game.

06:40.133 --> 06:44.905
I'm starting to think
that's not such a bad way to go.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.675
Does that mean
you're no longer interested

06:47.708 --> 06:49.677
in further treatment,
Mr. Seaton?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.516
( screaming )

06:55.549 --> 06:56.917
Sorry. Let's have Ativan now.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.919
( whimpering ):
I can't see.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.220
All right, just relax.
I can't see.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.689
I need some flush.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.924
Did you try to kill yourself,
Greg?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.727
No, it was an accident.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.961
He didn't mean it.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.497
Okay, page E.N.T.
and Optho.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.964
Get me a woods lamp
and flourescein.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.065
Who, Greg?
Who shot you?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.200
Tommy.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.868
Who's Tommy?
Is he a friend?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.637
He's my brother.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.605
He's ten.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.072
Okay, two view
of the face

07:19.106 --> 07:20.808
along with a trauma panel.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
Look at this light, Greg.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.611
Can you see
this light?

07:23.644 --> 07:24.612
A little.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.515
Where did Tommy get the gun?

07:27.515 --> 07:29.717
He was playing
with our dad's gun.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.719
I tried to take
it away from him
so he wouldn't

07:31.752 --> 07:33.787
hurt himself, but it went off.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.026
We'll do everything we can
to make you comfortable.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.594
Thank you.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.932
Let me know

07:44.965 --> 07:46.834
if there's anything
else you need, okay?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.536
Thank you.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.706
We should have pursued
other options.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.874
What?
With Corday.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.743
There are other treatments
to consider.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.244
I did; I asked for
the surgical consult.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.012
She didn't think
it was a good idea.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.682
Yeah, but what if it's in
the patient's best interest?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.851
I know you went up against
Carter on a terminal patient

08:03.884 --> 08:04.818
but that's
not your job.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.720
You're a med student.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.789
I'm saying it could
just be this guy's
having a bad day.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.257
We try to do what's
best for the patient

08:10.290 --> 08:11.692
and respect
their wishes.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.160
If we're lucky,
we get to do both.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.562
This is one
of those times.

08:16.296 --> 08:19.232
Have Pedes page me
when he comes out of surgery.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.635
Dr. Kovac?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.270
Mike Dobbs.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.273
I think you know
my wife, Heather.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.209
Look, we've been having
some rough times recently

08:29.242 --> 08:32.111
but I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop seeing her.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.282
Maybe you should speak
to your wife about this.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.619
Yeah, I did.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.020
Are you married?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.222
I was.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.692
Well, then you know
how hard it can be.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.993
Look, I'm
not trying

08:46.026 --> 08:47.895
to threaten you
or anything, man

08:47.928 --> 08:48.896
but I got two daughters.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.598
What am I supposed to tell them

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
when their mother
doesn't come home at night?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.236
I don't know.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.743
Just trying to keep my family
together, that's all.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.349
Hey, Eric, it's me again.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.284
Listen, could you please
call me back?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.020
You don't even have
to talk to me.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.222
If you just leave a message
on my machine

09:15.255 --> 09:16.624
I'd appreciate it.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.991
Thank you.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.229
Looks like your day's
sucking as bad as mine.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.331
Yeah, I just, I'm worried
about my brother.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.866
I can't
get in touch with him.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.134
At least you haven't
killed anyone.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.702
I'm 0 for two.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.204
All these patients
could be my next victim.

09:31.238 --> 09:36.209
Aha. "I think I have the crabs,
and it itches bad."

09:36.243 --> 09:38.245
So, you're not taking
the chest pain in four?

09:38.278 --> 09:39.847
Not if he wants to live.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.649
The guy in Exam Two
has scrotal swelling.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.783
Pretty safe bet.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.317
Uh, I'm not
that desperate.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.753
At least
it's medical.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.387
He's pushing 300 pounds.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.388
It's a big scrotum.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.957
( chuckles )

09:49.990 --> 09:52.225
He's a heart attack
waiting to happen.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.661
Half these
patients are.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.729
Old, diabetic, old,
old and diabetic...

09:55.763 --> 09:56.897
Did you reach him yet?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.666
No, I keep getting
his voice mail.

09:58.699 --> 10:02.803
Oh, screw it, give me
the swollen scrotum.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.672
Maybe he's off with a buddy,
or something.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.006
Dr. Carter,
could you reassess

10:06.039 --> 10:07.207
my allergic reaction
in Two?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.075
Yeah, I'll be right there.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.142
Where's Jody?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.744
She's checking into a hotel.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.713
Do you want to get a cup
of coffee or something?

10:12.746 --> 10:14.347
He didn't respond to
Benadryl or Cimetidine.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.415
Try solumedrol.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.784
I did; he's
still wheezing.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.118
Try an albuterol treatment.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.286
It didn't work.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.154
Maybe I should
push an IV epi.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.355
I'll be right back.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.691
What are his sats?

10:23.724 --> 10:24.758
83. On oxygen.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.886
Medical facility, please.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.025
Hi, I'm calling from Chicago's

10:58.058 --> 10:59.927
County General
Emergency Department.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.863
We're treating a patient from
your base-- Eric Wyczenski.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.867
We're going to need
his medical records faxed over.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.236
I don't have the chart
in front of me.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.338
Does it matter
who the doctor is?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.743
Okay, uh, uh, just a second.

11:21.481 --> 11:27.755
Um, the physician's name
is Dr. John Carter.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.193
Oh...
Excuse me.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.128
It's okay.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.935
How are you feeling, Greg?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.271
My eyes hurt.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.473
Can you see anything?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.142
No.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.112
Hey, Chuny...

11:52.145 --> 11:53.781
Yeah.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.317
I'm sorry...
about everything.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.087
Me, too.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.859
Am I blind?

12:05.893 --> 12:08.161
You have a shotgun pellet
inside your eyeball

12:08.195 --> 12:11.131
but we're bringing
in an eye specialist
to repair it.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.801
You were lucky--
you could've blown
your head off.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.536
My dad would be less mad at me
if I was... dead.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.505
He shouldn't be angry
with you at all.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.174
You probably saved
your brother's life.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.879
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a second?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.214
Shoot.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.816
HALEH:
Carter!

12:28.816 --> 12:30.083
Carter!

12:30.117 --> 12:31.952
Is there anything
wrong with him?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.020
Not that I can tell.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.554
Neighbor heard
the baby crying.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.958
Found mom down in the backyard,
the kid still in the swing.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.292
Mom's got no sign of trauma.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.128
Could be
a possible mixed O.D.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.296
G.C.S. four-one-five,
but she's uncooperative.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.464
B.P. 122/78, pulse 84.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.432
Okay. What's her name?

12:45.465 --> 12:47.100
The neighbor wasn't sure--

12:47.134 --> 12:49.169
thought it was Tenji or Tong-yi,
something like that.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.370
She didn't have any ID.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.939
Ma'am,
I'm Dr. Carter.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.406
Can you tell me
your name?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.176
I have a 16-year-old boy
who's going to go blind

12:56.209 --> 12:57.544
if he doesn't get here fast.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.112
Then tell me where he is

12:59.146 --> 13:01.314
so I can at least call
for some initial orders.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.584
He's where?

13:04.617 --> 13:08.121
Eyes open to painful stimuli.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.124
Is your name
Tenji or Tong-yi?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.126
Is she oriented
to person?
Her little boy's fine.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.494
Does she understand
English?

13:14.527 --> 13:15.963
Gag reflexes present.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.597
I smell alcohol
on her breath.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.899
Got your bloods.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.267
Okay,
what do you want?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.135
C.B.C., uh, lytes,
E.T.O.H...

13:22.169 --> 13:24.404
Aspirin
and acetaminophen levels.
( phone ringing )

13:24.437 --> 13:26.373
Hello?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.175
Eric.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.576
What about charcoal?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.178
Where are you?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.446
The 2001 recommendations
from the American Academy...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.448
LOCKHART:
Jody came by;
she's looking for you.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.984
Okay, I need to see you.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.318
I need to talk to you
about a couple things.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.586
She can't tell us
when she took it.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.121
Right. 25 of charcoal.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.623
I need some Surgilube
and an N.G. tube.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.259
Abby, she needs a Foley
and a urine tox screen.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.461
Damn it.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.130
And... let's change
the saline to D5

13:50.163 --> 13:51.598
half at 75 an hour.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.234
Blunted deep tendon
reflexes-- could be benzos.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.236
Oh, should we try
flumazenil?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.505
Only if you want her
to start seizing.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.606
Did you lose him?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.441
Yeah, I lost him.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.011
MAN:
It's not unusual to experience
these sort of feelings

14:04.044 --> 14:05.946
when dealing
with a chronic illness.

14:05.979 --> 14:06.914
Mr. Nathan

14:06.947 --> 14:07.915
may I have a word?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.517
Excuse me.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.921
What's he doing
in there?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.488
Oh, that's Dr. Harvey;
he's the attending psych...

14:15.522 --> 14:16.623
I know who he is.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.158
I asked you
what he's doing.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.360
He was down on a psych consult
on another patient

14:20.393 --> 14:23.363
and I asked if he would come
and speak with Mr. Seaton.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.932
Did you run this
by Dr. Lewis?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.233
No.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.068
But Dr. Harvey agreed.
Mr. Seaton was depressed

14:28.101 --> 14:29.536
and wasn't in a position
to be objective

14:29.569 --> 14:31.071
about his own treatment.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.472
He's refused treatment.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.975
But now he's willing
to consider other options.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.343
A Whipple, for instance.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.478
A Whipple?

14:38.511 --> 14:42.282
No, please don't tell me
you suggested a Whipple
for this patient.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.251
I'm not sure who brought it up.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.319
Well, whoever did
must be utterly insane

14:46.353 --> 14:48.521
because nobody in their
right mind would be suggesting

14:48.555 --> 14:50.290
a six-hour operation
for this man.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.959
An operation
that requires

14:51.959 --> 14:54.027
months of recovery,
assuming he ever recovers.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.395
And for what?

14:55.428 --> 14:56.964
He's dead in two months
if we do nothing.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.498
That's right.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.267
But only you seem to be
unwilling to accept that.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.369
Well, shouldn't
we at least present him

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
with all the facts
and let him decide?

15:07.174 --> 15:09.176
You've done enough,
thank you.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.647
Normal vitals,
satting well on room air.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.483
Did you get
your phone working?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.218
No.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.154
Tox screen is positive
for barbiturates only.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.390
Blood alcohol level
is only .065.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.393
Urine dip's negative,
but ICON's positive.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.995
She's coming around.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.162
Ma'am!

15:29.196 --> 15:30.430
Do you know
that you're pregnant?!

15:30.463 --> 15:32.265
You speak English?

15:32.299 --> 15:35.002
Where's Chen?
Maybe she can
translate for us.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.669
I want to rule out
an ectopic.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.072
Where's the, uh,
portable ultrasound?
I'll get it.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.240
Uh, can I do it?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.341
Yeah, I'll be
right back.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.010
I'm sorry, Abby

15:43.010 --> 15:45.012
but that was right in
the middle of a trauma.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.613
I know.
Maybe he'll
call back.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.515
Did you check
your home machine?

15:48.548 --> 15:51.218
No, I didn't have
a chance to.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.653
Well, how did he sound?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.388
That depends
on who you ask.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.325
He sounds great--
he's happy, he's carefree

15:58.358 --> 16:00.260
he's having the time of his...

16:00.293 --> 16:02.129
life.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.667
I think just the, uh,
fact that he called
is a pretty good sign.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.036
Yeah, he's manic, Carter.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.370
Say, Abby!

16:10.403 --> 16:12.172
Here's two of
the country's finest

16:12.205 --> 16:13.740
looking for a patient.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.709
I'm Sergeant Andrews
with the Air Force's

16:16.743 --> 16:18.445
Office of Special
Investigation.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.081
I understand you're
treating Eric Wyczenski.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.649
No. Uh, we were,
but we're not now.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.184
He left against medical advice.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.186
Any idea of where he
may have been going?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.620
Uh, no. I'm sorry
we can't be more helpful

16:27.654 --> 16:29.189
but we have an emergency
coming in.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.357
What about the doctor
who treated him?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.292
He had to take a trauma
upstairs.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.526
If you leave your card
with the desk clerk

16:33.560 --> 16:34.661
we'll call you
if he shows up again.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.265
What was all that about?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.499
I was just about
to tell you.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.134
( sighs )

16:41.168 --> 16:42.802
These are your brother's
medical records?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.704
I said we were treating him.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.640
You'd still require
his signature.

16:47.674 --> 16:52.245
And a written request
from his attending physician

16:52.279 --> 16:55.182
which in this case was...

16:56.483 --> 16:57.784
You forged my name, too?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.219
Do you know how much

16:59.252 --> 17:01.188
trouble we could get
into for this?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.356
Just read it.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.824
No. I have no right
to read this

17:04.857 --> 17:06.526
and neither do you.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.296
Okay. He took a leave of absence
for post traumatic stress

17:09.329 --> 17:10.730
following a near-miss incident.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.699
Yeah, so? He's an
air traffic controller;

17:12.732 --> 17:14.101
it's a stressful job.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.836
He had therapy,
but was never medicated.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.471
Probably no reason to.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.473
Just a reaction
to the event.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.742
Okay, what if
it isn't PTSD?

17:22.775 --> 17:25.278
What if it was depression?

17:25.311 --> 17:27.579
The initial presentation
of a bipolar disorder?

17:27.614 --> 17:28.681
He's too old.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.582
He's not,
he's under 30.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.650
Well, then he'd be

17:30.683 --> 17:32.519
at the far end
of the curve.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.854
He's been suffering from
insomnia, lack of appetite...

17:34.887 --> 17:37.224
Both of which are consistent
with PTSD.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.725
Okay. Six months ago,
he was depressed

17:38.758 --> 17:40.493
now he's cycling up
to a manic phase.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.261
The timing is perfect.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.795
I know this.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.198
Well, then, why didn't
the Air Force catch it?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.134
Because they're not
looking for it.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.636
Look: "No family history
of psychiatric disorders."

17:49.669 --> 17:51.238
He's lying to the doctors.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.306
Like you did
to get those records.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.142
( sighs )

17:55.175 --> 17:58.878
Oh, I thought this was
a surgical consult.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.347
It was.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.314
What happened?

18:01.348 --> 18:02.382
The fat lady sang.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.750
Fat man in this case.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.819
We did everything
but order him a deep-dish pizza.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.288
MALIK:
Just say no to drugs

18:08.321 --> 18:09.656
and double
bacon cheeseburgers.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.292
You know, his size is
probably something

18:12.325 --> 18:14.161
that he couldn't control.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.596
Certainly not
if he was running downhill.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.165
( Malik chuckles )

18:18.165 --> 18:19.832
Nathan, we didn't mean
to offend you.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.468
You didn't.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.436
I'm sorry,
I'm having a really bad day.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.438
Not as bad as him.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.312
What the hell
is that?
I don't know.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.381
You can't drive on
here, you idiot.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.815
Which one of you is
Dr. Abrams?

18:35.848 --> 18:36.816
I'm Abrams.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.418
You need to come
with me now.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.753
I've got a 14-year-old boy
with a ruptured globe

18:40.787 --> 18:42.189
who may lose his eyesight

18:42.189 --> 18:43.690
because you didn't answer
your page.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.193
You're insane.

18:46.226 --> 18:46.926
Get in the car.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.794
Get out of here.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.429
Get in the car, now.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.298
You don't have to listen
to this guy, Vic.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.632
Are you a doctor?

18:52.665 --> 18:53.833
I'm an oral surgeon.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.202
Then shut up!
Let's go!

18:55.235 --> 18:55.868
What about my clubs?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.470
You, take his clubs.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.307
You're doing a good job
clearing patients today.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.343
Easy to be fast
when you're just killing them.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.378
I'm going to be taking
some time off.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.679
Yeah? For what?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.481
Uh, to deal
with some personal things

19:08.515 --> 19:10.583
that I've been putting off
for a while.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.319
And with Romano
out of commission

19:12.352 --> 19:15.255
you'll probably be the one
forced to pick up the slack.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.256
Bad idea.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.557
Do you mind?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.392
We're having a
conversation here.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.393
I don't mind.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.928
Well, I do. I mind.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.464
I mind your insinuations
and your smart-ass comments.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.634
This is an E.R.;
people come here
because it's an emergency.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.503
And guess what?
Some of these people
are going to die.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.771
I've saved
hundreds of lives.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.306
Dr. Lewis...
Yeah.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.775
You know that drunk you
intubated this morning?

19:35.808 --> 19:36.909
( sighing ):
Yeah?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.545
Well, he asked
to take his tube out.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.879
Chuny, he can't talk
if he's intubated.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.614
I think you better come.

19:41.648 --> 19:45.252
He's going to vomit
and aspirate.
Ah, geez.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.554
( hushed ):
20 bucks says
she kills this guy, too.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.322
Frank, did my brother call?

19:49.356 --> 19:50.490
Nope.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.458
Are you sure?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.460
Let me double check.
Nope.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.861
CARTER:
Hey, Abby.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.863
Tell Abby what you just told me.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.299
An unauthorized absence can be
a serious offense.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.600
But if it's a first offense

20:00.633 --> 20:02.702
and you can prove
extenuating circumstances

20:02.735 --> 20:04.237
then you can usually get off

20:04.271 --> 20:05.372
with a minimum
of punishment.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.306
That's good to know. Thanks.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.340
Do you have a minute?

20:07.374 --> 20:08.408
Yeah.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.380
Your girlfriend Harkins
was looking for you.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.348
( chuckles )

20:15.382 --> 20:17.750
Um, why are you talking
about my brother

20:17.784 --> 20:18.818
to med students?

20:18.851 --> 20:19.919
Gallant's in the Army.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.388
So?

20:21.421 --> 20:22.389
So I'm just trying
to get information.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.023
I thought it might help.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.858
Yeah, well, you didn't have
to say it was my brother.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.993
Excuse me, Carter.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.628
This is Mr.
and Mrs. Yeung.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.930
Their child was
brought in.
Which one?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.699
The three-year-old,
he was brought in
with your patient.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.602
Oh, I... I'm sorry,
I thought she was the mother.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.505
No, Tong-yi's our nanny.
I'm Aidan's mother.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.506
Is our son okay?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.807
Yeah, he's fine.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.809
Chuny, you can take
Mrs. Yeung to see her son.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.477
Sure, this way.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.314
Sir, if I could just ask you
a couple of questions first.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.349
Yeah... okay.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.485
Um... is Tong-yi
a drug user?

20:52.519 --> 20:53.520
No.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.555
Has she been depressed?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.357
No.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.692
Can you think of any reason why
she would want to hurt herself?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.060
She wouldn't do that.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.597
She tested positive for
barbiturates and alcohol.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.866
Well, she's been up
all week with Aidan.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.535
He had an earache.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.438
She might've taken
a couple of sleeping pills

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
maybe a glass of wine.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.441
But she is not suicidal.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.843
Does she have a boyfriend?

21:16.876 --> 21:19.078
I don't think so.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.448
Why?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.683
I just... I don't know,
maybe she's got some problems

21:23.716 --> 21:25.051
in her personal life.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.454
Well, if she did,
we'd probably know.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.588
She lives with us.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.357
Has been for
four years now.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.458
Ah.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.427
Can I see her?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.828
You wanted to see me?

21:35.862 --> 21:37.764
Did you review Zollinger?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.931
Was I supposed to?

21:38.965 --> 21:39.866
He's under,
Dr. Corday.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.601
Thanks, Shirley.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.803
We're really going to do
a Whipple on this guy?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.372
He's a little old,
isn't he?

21:45.405 --> 21:46.839
I thought you didn't want
to do this.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.007
I didn't,
but thanks to you

21:48.040 --> 21:49.709
Mr. Seaton and
his family seem to think

21:49.742 --> 21:51.077
the operation is
worth the risk.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.879
Of course, they may have
second thoughts

21:52.912 --> 21:55.382
after we resect his pancreas,
duodenum, gallbladder

21:55.382 --> 21:56.983
and a large portion
of his stomach.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.985
He's got a daughter
and grandchildren.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.454
Any extra time he gets,
he can spend with them.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.456
He can get up to
a year from this.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.724
Perhaps.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.693
If it comes with a small miracle

22:06.726 --> 22:09.596
which may be in order,
seeing as you seem
to have become

22:09.629 --> 22:12.432
the patron saint
of the terminally ill.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.534
Are you prepared to assist?

22:14.567 --> 22:15.968
Really?

22:16.002 --> 22:21.874
You got us into this.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.724
CARTER:
We're still running
some tests.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.826
Okay, Sonosite is ready.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.428
I need both
trauma rooms.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.430
Double MVA en route,
auto versus motorcycle.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.130
Can I take these two?

22:44.163 --> 22:45.498
Yeah.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.000
Grab trauma gowns and gloves.
Come on.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.436
Can we take her home?

22:49.436 --> 22:50.770
She should stay overnight

22:50.803 --> 22:51.871
for observation.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.473
In that case

22:53.506 --> 22:55.942
I'd like to have her moved
to a private facility.

22:55.975 --> 22:59.646
Did you ask her
why she did it?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.814
( speaking Chinese )

23:03.716 --> 23:07.687
( speaking Chinese )

23:07.720 --> 23:09.756
( speaking Chinese )

23:09.789 --> 23:11.190
She's not depressed.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.725
It was an accident.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.461
She had taken a couple
of sleeping pills

23:14.494 --> 23:16.195
with a glass of wine
to help her sleep.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.098
And she's sorry
to have caused you any trouble.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.933
She said all that?

23:20.967 --> 23:23.202
Yes.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.938
Suction here,
so I can see the field.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.840
Are you okay?

23:27.874 --> 23:30.510
I've been up
for 24 hours.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.645
It throws off
my meds.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.581
Does it usually
bleed this much?

23:34.614 --> 23:35.882
There are numerous branches

23:35.915 --> 23:37.517
off the superior
mesenteric artery.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.651
Hemostat.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.086
Do we tie off
or bovie?

23:40.119 --> 23:41.588
( alarms sound )

23:41.621 --> 23:43.623
Pressure's
down to
90/60.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.859
Okay. Bolus a liter
and check a crit.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.995
Like this?

23:49.028 --> 23:51.598
You need to isolate the source
of the bleeding.

23:51.631 --> 23:52.499
Come on, Nathan.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.766
I need better exposure.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.602
Wait, stop, stop.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.737
You're up
against the portal vein.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.172
Pull out before
you tear the wall and kill him.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.841
Shirley, can you take over,
please?

24:01.874 --> 24:03.643
No, just tell
me what to do.
I'll do it.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.811
I'm trying.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.713
Shirley, suction.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.618
( metal crashing )

24:11.651 --> 24:13.119
What was that?

24:13.152 --> 24:14.654
T-tube for the common bile duct.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.622
Do you have another tray?

24:15.655 --> 24:16.756
We can autoclave this one.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.857
I don't have 30 minutes

24:17.890 --> 24:19.058
to stand around
waiting for this.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.259
Tell me what you
want me to do.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.828
Nothing. Shirley

24:21.861 --> 24:23.530
pick up the instruments,
get them resterilized.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.832
This will pass in about an hour.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.236
Carl Vanosh, 32,
motorcycle driver

24:30.269 --> 24:31.103
versus stakebed truck.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.705
Had to be extracted.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.541
Unable to breathe
for three to four minutes.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.808
He's purple.
Violaceous
discoloration.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.111
Classic
traumatic
asphyxia.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.647
I'll meet
you inside.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.914
This the driver of the truck?

24:41.948 --> 24:43.082
No. Motorcycle passenger.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.751
Quinn Vanosh,
11.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.218
BP falling
after two
liters. 90/60.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.787
Nobody told me
they were bringing in a kid.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.288
He's tachy
to the mid 120's.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.823
We were going to tube him,
but we were almost here.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.158
Go get one of the attendings.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.893
Which one?
I don't care.
Anyone.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.800
Who's that?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.769
I thought you were treating her.

25:02.802 --> 25:03.870
I am.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.705
Dr. Chen is
translating for me.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.573
I should be doing that.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.807
Oh, that's okay.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.041
We're a full
service facility.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.209
Excuse me.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.679
( speaking Chinese )

25:12.712 --> 25:14.313
Um...

25:14.346 --> 25:15.882
( speaking Chinese )

25:15.915 --> 25:17.750
Hmm. She didn't know
she was pregnant.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.586
Did she say
who the father is?

25:19.619 --> 25:20.853
No.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.755
Ask her if she's sleeping
with her boss.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.191
What?
Ask her
if she's sleeping with him.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.598
( speaking Chinese )

25:33.800 --> 25:36.769
( speaking Chinese )

25:45.845 --> 25:47.313
CBC and plates,
crit times three.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.815
Chem seven, urine and foley.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.882
He's got Tardieu's spots.

25:49.916 --> 25:50.650
Tardieu?

25:50.683 --> 25:51.618
Facial petechiae.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.985
What fell on him?
A truck.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.353
LEWIS:
Kerry, we need
help in here.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.623
He's got crepitus
over the left chest.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.757
His pelvis
is tender.
Sats 93.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.925
It hurts
to breathe.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.026
Kerry, I need help in here.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.861
VANOSH:
Quinn? What's wrong?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.296
GALLANT:
Left breath sounds decreased
with right tracheal shift.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.331
( alarms )
Sux and fent are in.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.365
Sats are still 90.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.667
He needs a
central line

26:07.700 --> 26:08.701
and probably
a chest tube.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.368
You're doing fine, Susan.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.737
Just take a deep breath.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.338
It's decreased
on the right.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.173
I think he's got
tension pneumos
on both sides.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.241
What's wrong
with my son?

26:15.274 --> 26:16.676
We're working on him.
Malik.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.110
HARKINS:
What do you want me
to do?

26:18.144 --> 26:19.278
Bag him up.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.247
HARKINS:
Ectopy.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.050
Okay, don't do this to me, kid.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.185
Oh.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.856
( speaking Chinese )

26:31.724 --> 26:33.192
Your wife
seems upset.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.796
She's worried
about Aidan and, uh, Tong-yi.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.330
That's all.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.767
Oh, our doctor's coming
to move her to another facility.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.769
Hey, what was
your relationship

26:42.802 --> 26:44.036
with Tong-yi again?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.838
I told you.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.173
She works for us.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.809
Right, she's lived with
you for four years?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.844
Have you been
sleeping with her?

26:51.878 --> 26:53.079
Excuse me?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.714
Have you been
having sex with her?

26:54.747 --> 26:55.882
'Cause she's pregnant.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.751
She says the
baby's yours.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.252
Even if that were true, Doctor

27:00.286 --> 27:01.788
it's really none
of your business.

27:01.821 --> 27:02.922
No, it is my business.

27:02.955 --> 27:03.823
It was my business
the minute

27:03.856 --> 27:05.157
she became my patient.

27:05.191 --> 27:07.093
Well, she won't be your patient
much longer.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.798
Hey, Carter.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.099
Eric, where
have you been?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.801
Everybody's been
worried about you.

27:14.834 --> 27:15.768
Oh!
Come inside.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.303
Oh, Jody was driving me nuts.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.739
Nothing like a road trip
to bring out a person's issues.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.007
Please limit your personal
baggage

27:21.040 --> 27:22.041
to two carry-on items.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.142
She must have peed 1,000 times

27:23.175 --> 27:24.176
between here and Indianapolis.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.045
She's worse than a beagle.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.347
She's probably got a bladder
thing happening. I don't know.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.949
Wait a second.
I thought you guys flew.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.417
Oh, we were until
she got airsick.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.719
Airsick,
carsick, homesick.

27:32.719 --> 27:33.886
The girl gets
sick a lot

27:33.920 --> 27:35.722
which supposedly
runs in her family.

27:35.722 --> 27:36.355
Don't get me started
on her parents.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.124
Let's just face it.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
If she turns out
to be anything
like her mother

27:40.026 --> 27:42.061
she's going to be
too much woman
for me to handle

27:42.094 --> 27:43.262
and I don't
mean to be mean,
but she's big

27:43.295 --> 27:45.097
like sumo big,
minus the agility.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.199
I'll come upstairs later
to see how you're doing.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.267
Will you still talk
to my dad?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.802
I'll do even better.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.838
I'll convince him
you're a hero.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.742
You know, the in-house team
could have done this.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.043
You are the
retinal specialist.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.210
According to the CT

27:58.244 --> 27:59.746
the other eye has a pellet
in it, too.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.247
Now, I can't even promise

28:01.280 --> 28:03.082
I'll be able to
save his sight
in that eye.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.084
Then perhaps
if you had come here sooner.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.153
Ophthalmology isn't
emergency medicine.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.821
You know, some
guys wait a week

28:08.855 --> 28:10.489
to do this kind of surgery.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.159
You know, all you
did was stop me
from shooting an 82.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.293
Tell it to him.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.494
LOCKHART:
Luka.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.964
Dr. Lewis needs
you in Trauma One.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.131
Oh, thanks.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.867
ERIC:
Hey, Abby.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.902
So, I'm in a position
where I can buy the Cessna

28:22.935 --> 28:25.337
or two planes that need some
fixing up for the same price.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.806
I'll be at Admit
if you need me.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.774
( clears throat )

28:27.807 --> 28:28.274
I've been calling you.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.809
So I hear.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.243
I'm sorry Jody dragged
you into this.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.879
She's immature.
She likes the drama.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.380
What can I say?
It's the Jerry Springer

28:34.413 --> 28:35.782
generation, you know.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.950
You were supposed to be

28:37.984 --> 28:39.919
Did they call here?
Uh, no.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.021
That's the second time this year
somebody's messed up my leave.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.856
I can straighten it
out with a phone call

28:43.890 --> 28:45.858
but I'll have
to report for
duty on Monday.

28:45.892 --> 28:46.959
We should do something crazy.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.360
Do you guys want
to go somewhere?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.429
How about you, me and Carter
fly to Vegas, huh?

28:50.462 --> 28:51.798
We could do a
little gambling.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.065
Maybe hit an Elvis
wedding chapel.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.366
You guys could take
care of business.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.802
You may now kiss
the bride.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.036
Shh, shh.
Thank you
very much.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.505
Eric, just come
here. Just stop it.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.840
They said
you're suffering

29:00.873 --> 29:02.041
from post
traumatic Stress?

29:02.074 --> 29:03.542
That was nothing.
They cleared me.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.812
Every controller I know has
had a couple PTSD assessments.

29:05.812 --> 29:06.879
It's our way
of working the system

29:06.913 --> 29:08.047
to get a little
extra time off.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.816
We even joke about it.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.483
How do you know when an air
traffic controller is suffering

29:11.517 --> 29:12.819
from post traumatic stress?

29:12.852 --> 29:13.920
Eric.
His tackle box is missing.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.888
You know,
he's gone fishing.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.423
But I hate going fishing.
I mean, I...

29:17.456 --> 29:19.959
Remember when I got that...
that hook stuck in my finger?

29:19.992 --> 29:21.460
Do you remember that?
It was a frog lure.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.461
I got your
medical records.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.030
What?

29:24.063 --> 29:27.466
You didn't tell them
Maggie was bipolar.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.935
Oh, you did what?

29:28.968 --> 29:30.369
What are you, the KGB?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.570
No, I just...

29:31.603 --> 29:32.839
Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.

29:32.872 --> 29:33.906
You called the MPs?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.241
No. No.
Why did you do this?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.009
You're under arrest
for unauthorized absence

29:37.043 --> 29:37.844
from the United States

29:37.844 --> 29:38.878
Air Force.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.112
Hold on a
second, guys.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.480
Somebody was supposed
to cover for me

29:41.513 --> 29:42.514
and he got in a bad accident.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.916
I was on the road.

29:43.950 --> 29:44.583
I didn't find out
until now.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.918
I-I called my CO.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.086
I'm headed back
to base now.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.354
I came here to
tell my sister.

29:48.387 --> 29:49.355
They called here looking

29:49.388 --> 29:50.456
for me and freaked her out.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.891
It's been a
huge mix-up.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.325
Abby, tell them
what's going on.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.994
We'll figure that out
on the way back.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.162
Hold on. That is very
unnecessary.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.864
Let me get my stuff
out of my car!

29:57.864 --> 29:58.865
Stop!
Let me get my stuff.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.032
Don't hurt him.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.901
Listen...
let me go.

30:01.934 --> 30:02.969
I can explain everything.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.403
Okay? Just... I need to go!

30:04.436 --> 30:05.537
Seriously.

30:05.571 --> 30:06.505
I can't be arrested.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.439
I've got a job to do.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.440
Can't we talk about this

30:08.474 --> 30:09.541
or at least let me give him

30:09.575 --> 30:10.843
something to
calm him down.

30:10.877 --> 30:11.878
We can't do that, ma'am.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.012
Is this
what you wanted, Abby?

30:13.045 --> 30:14.613
No, no.
Are you happy now?

30:14.646 --> 30:15.982
Yeah, that's right.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.249
Lock me up
and throw away the key.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.350
Eric's been a bad boy.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.920
Thanks a lot, Abby.
Thank you.

30:24.190 --> 30:24.924
Suction.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.192
Oh, damn it.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.626
Bag him.
Was he
ever awake?

30:27.659 --> 30:28.995
He was for a few minutes.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.229
He wasn't mentating well.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.098
He's stage four shock,
non-responder.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.265
Both lungs are up.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.566
Breath sounds with bagging.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.035
Third unit of O-neg.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.069
You want to try this?

30:37.103 --> 30:37.937
No, you got it.

30:37.970 --> 30:38.637
Stabilize the neck.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.472
I'll do a cricoid.

30:44.543 --> 30:45.978
Damn. Suction.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.313
He's so small.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.314
Short chin.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.548
Anterior too.

30:49.581 --> 30:50.449
Not your lucky day, huh?

30:50.482 --> 30:51.483
( alarm sounds )

30:51.517 --> 30:52.952
Sat 88, pulse
down to 90.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.520
You need help in here?
No.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.587
Yes. Suction.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.123
He'll need another central line

30:57.156 --> 30:57.957
for pressors.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.058
What do you see?

30:59.091 --> 31:00.226
I can't see squat.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.660
Okay, let's
take a break.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.628
No.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.030
Tube, now.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.265
Bradying down to 80.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.599
Cords.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.938
Got it.

31:11.971 --> 31:12.939
Bag him.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.341
CHEN:
Good job.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.476
All right.
You got this?

31:17.509 --> 31:18.510
What?

31:18.544 --> 31:19.645
Where are you going?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.113
I have other patients.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.581
Susan, you're
not finished here.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.116
He's in good hands.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.321
What's happening?

31:29.355 --> 31:30.656
We put him on a vent
and he dropped his pressure.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.657
Good lung sounds.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.025
Give me
a spinal needle.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.493
Lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.594
Betadine.
Tamponade?

31:35.627 --> 31:37.063
Could be
a tension pneumo.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.197
Breath sounds
could be transmitted.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.431
Sats are dropping.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.632
CHEN:
Could be
hypovolemic.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.170
Try the other side.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.275
No.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.609
Milligram of epi.

31:50.642 --> 31:51.677
Good pulse
with compressions.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.379
Thoracotomy
tray.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.446
Holding CPR.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.714
Looks like PEA.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.017
Betadine the chest.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.086
Trendelenberg
and roll him
left side up.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.720
Blunt force trauma, Luka.
It's over.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.990
Mediastinal air
after intubation.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.257
Blade.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.026
No pressure, no pulse.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.429
What is he doing?

32:10.462 --> 32:11.697
Spreader.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.235
Opening
the chest cavity.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.304
Pericardium looks clear.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.205
Quiet.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.439
( squeaking )

32:20.472 --> 32:24.010
Okay, bag him
a couple of times fast.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.477
( squeaking )
Hear it?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.413
Hilar leak.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.247
Clamp.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.681
Bag.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.185
How long?

32:33.219 --> 32:34.386
Almost a minute.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.022
Again.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.457
Got it.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.592
Cross clamp.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.228
Can you get me a 50cc syringe

32:42.261 --> 32:43.595
with an 18-gauge
needle?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.064
Okay...

32:45.097 --> 32:47.233
pressure's
going up-- 50's.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.042
Evacuating the air.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.046
That's why he
couldn't pump blood.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.514
CHEN:
Weak pulse.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.650
Got a pulse.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.187
Wow...

33:08.220 --> 33:09.488
So you can stay here

33:09.521 --> 33:12.624
you can be safe here.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.527
Can you explain the concept
of a woman's shelter?

33:15.561 --> 33:16.462
Um...

33:16.495 --> 33:19.165
( speaking Chinese )

33:20.399 --> 33:22.334
( speaking Chinese )

33:22.368 --> 33:24.436
What is she so afraid of?

33:24.470 --> 33:26.338
Living in poverty,
deportation...

33:26.372 --> 33:27.639
Take your pick.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.375
It's called "trafficking
in persons."

33:29.408 --> 33:31.210
You know, young women
are brought over

33:31.243 --> 33:32.711
from some
foreign country

33:32.744 --> 33:34.313
they get
offered jobs

33:34.346 --> 33:36.348
and wind up as
indentured servants.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.086
I can't leave my baby.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.755
Uh, you don't have to.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.257
This is...
this is your baby.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.159
Nobody's going
to take your baby.

33:47.193 --> 33:50.096
Not this baby.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.298
Aidan.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.466
The three-year-old?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.103
Is Aidan your son, too?

33:59.671 --> 34:01.107
Yes.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.683
Okay, Kit, let's try
a t-piece trial.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.553
NATHAN:
Normally we would
have extubated

34:14.585 --> 34:15.721
in the OR, right?

34:15.754 --> 34:17.156
CORDAY:
Normally.

34:21.860 --> 34:25.597
No chest wall
excursions.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.433
Stats are going
down to 89.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.702
Why isn't he breathing
on his own?

34:36.141 --> 34:37.676
AC of 14.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.753
I'll go talk
with the family.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.722
No. I'm afraid
I get to do that.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.831
I knew something was wrong,
I knew it.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.167
I told you.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.734
It's going
to be okay.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.836
No, it's not.
Don't say that.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.272
He's sick.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.806
I don't even know
where they took him

35:07.839 --> 35:09.775
and the Air Force
is not like the police.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.843
I can't just go there
and bail him out.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.245
I don't even know
who to call.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.347
( sighs )

35:15.381 --> 35:17.716
And what if they put him
in some VA loony bin?

35:17.749 --> 35:18.517
That's not
going to happen.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.918
How do you know?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.720
'Cause we'll get him
a good lawyer.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.422
We'll help him
through this.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.793
Why don't you go home?

35:27.826 --> 35:29.661
I'll get somebody
to cover your shift.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.729
I can't.

35:30.762 --> 35:31.897
Go home.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.201
Get some rest.
Call me if you need me.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.709
Hey, I thought
you'd left.

35:43.742 --> 35:44.676
How's that kid?

35:44.710 --> 35:45.777
He had a Hilar leak.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.379
Kovac had
to crack his chest.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.814
Pedes surg
is with him now.

35:48.847 --> 35:49.948
It looks like he's
going to pull through.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.283
( sighs )

35:51.317 --> 35:52.618
You would have
done the same.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.785
Kerry, I killed
three patients today.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.221
It would have been four

35:55.254 --> 35:56.522
if I would have
stayed with that kid.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.458
No, you were unable
to save three patients.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.892
You didn't kill them.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.762
I mean, I've seen you
save twice that many

36:03.795 --> 36:05.564
without breaking
a sweat.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.233
Go home.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.367
Have a drink

36:08.400 --> 36:09.501
maybe two.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.737
Tomorrow's another day.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.805
But if you lose
more than one patient

36:13.839 --> 36:14.873
you're fired.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.242
Thanks.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.776
Hey.
Hello.

36:17.809 --> 36:18.777
How you doing?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.846
Good, good.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.782
Did you?

36:23.815 --> 36:24.716
No.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.817
Are you
going to?

36:25.851 --> 36:26.885
No, you can.

36:26.918 --> 36:27.919
No, you should.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.255
Come on.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.756
Okay.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.859
Susan, um...

36:33.892 --> 36:34.760
we're going to have a baby.

36:34.793 --> 36:35.894
What?!

36:35.927 --> 36:37.696
You're
pregnant?
No.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.265
Uh, I am.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.867
Oh, my God.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.269
Kerry...

36:43.269 --> 36:44.803
Congratulations.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.405
Thank you.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.840
Thank you so much.

36:48.874 --> 36:49.741
CARTER:
Tong-yi, where you going?

36:49.775 --> 36:50.976
She's going home.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.444
I'm not talking to you,
you step back.

36:52.478 --> 36:53.645
This is between
me and my patient.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.846
She signed out
against medical advice.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.515
All right, Deb,
call the police.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.284
Don't bother.
She won't press charges.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.285
We have laws

36:59.318 --> 37:00.619
against slavery in this country.

37:00.652 --> 37:01.953
Tong-yi, you don't
have to do this.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.289
( speaking Chinese )

37:03.322 --> 37:04.890
I'll bring the car around.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.592
( speaking Chinese )

37:06.625 --> 37:08.494
All right,
don't do this, Tong-yi.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.595
It's wrong. It's wrong.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.929
I need my job.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.632
I have family in China,
they need my money.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.033
We can help you
find another job.

37:15.066 --> 37:15.967
I can't leave my baby.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.303
If you go back there

37:17.336 --> 37:18.337
they're going to
take your baby

37:18.370 --> 37:19.771
just like they
did with Aidan.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.374
I spend more time with him
than they do.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.310
You should,
he's your son.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.545
Does he even know
that you're his mother?

37:29.848 --> 37:30.882
He doesn't.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.720
But I do.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.792
How's Mr. Seaton?

37:40.826 --> 37:43.395
He's still on the vent.

37:43.429 --> 37:46.532
When you first came
to me, you requested

37:46.565 --> 37:48.867
that I treat you like
any other medical student

37:48.900 --> 37:49.801
on my rotation.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.702
And I appreciate it.

37:50.736 --> 37:51.903
I know your disease

37:51.937 --> 37:54.373
presents you with
innumerable challenges

37:54.406 --> 37:56.808
and the very fact
that you're standing here

37:56.842 --> 37:58.610
is testimony
to your character.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.812
But the truth is
I would fail

38:00.846 --> 38:02.881
any other student
with a similar performance.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.783
I realize I have to make
certain adjustments

38:04.816 --> 38:06.051
to accommodate my disease.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.353
No. No.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.655
Political correctness aside

38:09.688 --> 38:11.590
you are
physically handicapped

38:11.623 --> 38:12.891
and I would be doing
a disservice

38:12.924 --> 38:14.960
to your future patients.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.862
So that's it?

38:19.865 --> 38:21.767
What's the appeal process?

38:24.135 --> 38:25.771
A promise.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.373
I will pass you

38:27.373 --> 38:29.975
if you do not practice
clinical medicine.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.577
You can do radiology, psychiatry

38:31.610 --> 38:32.878
but you must give me your word

38:32.911 --> 38:34.946
that you will
never treat patients.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.548
No.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.450
I can't do that.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.420
Then you will fail,
Mr. Nathan.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.007
( sighs )

39:21.059 --> 39:22.961
Is someone
sitting here?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.930
No, no.

39:30.669 --> 39:33.539
You look like you've had
one of those days.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.441
Yeah, you could say that.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.476
What do you do?

39:39.445 --> 39:40.812
I'm a jockey.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.582
Ah, he has a sense of humor.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.684
Not really.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.888
It's pretty dead
in here tonight.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.524
That's the way I like it.

39:52.558 --> 39:56.127
I don't believe that
for a second.

39:56.161 --> 39:59.465
You look like you know
how to have fun.

39:59.498 --> 40:00.566
You think so, huh?

40:00.599 --> 40:01.633
Yeah.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.002
( cell phone ringing )

40:04.035 --> 40:05.070
Excuse me.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.106
Hello?

40:08.139 --> 40:11.877
No, I can't talk
to you right now.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.779
Yes, he came to see me.

40:13.812 --> 40:17.749
Yeah, I think you need
to stop calling me, okay?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.886
Sorry about that.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.155
( phone ringing )

40:32.864 --> 40:35.834
Why don't we, um...
get out of here

40:35.867 --> 40:38.870
and see what kind of
trouble we can get into?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.874
Where would we go?

40:44.042 --> 40:45.611
I'll leave that up to you.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.014
Okay, I think I know a place.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.850
It's 300 an hour.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.452
2,000 for the night.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.858
( chuckles )

41:19.277 --> 41:21.580
You coming?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.255
Hey.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.724
I've been
calling you.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.025
I was on the phone.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.260
Did you reach him?

41:37.228 --> 41:39.665
Might have to wait
till morning.

41:39.698 --> 41:40.899
Well, I got some

41:40.932 --> 41:43.001
fish and chips
from Brennan's.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.970
I'm not hungry.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.880
I bought it
on the way home from work.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.315
It took me an hour
to get it out of the bag

41:57.348 --> 42:00.318
and then another 45 minutes
to pour it in the glass

42:00.351 --> 42:02.087
and I still haven't had a sip.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.023
I just want everything
to stop, you know?

42:05.056 --> 42:06.692
I just want to stop thinking...

42:06.725 --> 42:08.193
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.837
I'm so glad you're home.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.006
I'm sorry.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.974
I'm so sorry.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.711
I wanted you
to be wrong.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.779
For both of you.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.820
My family's so screwed up.

42:36.354 --> 42:37.856
If I were you

42:37.889 --> 42:39.658
I'd run for my life
and never look back.

42:39.691 --> 42:42.260
You don't hold the monopoly
on screwed-up families.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.763
You met my mother.

42:44.796 --> 42:47.165
She's not certifiable.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.834
I have an idea.

42:48.867 --> 42:50.902
I think we should get them
all together for the holidays.

42:50.936 --> 42:53.805
Gamma, my parents,
your mother...

42:57.743 --> 42:59.645
I'm really scared
for him, Carter.

42:59.678 --> 43:00.979
I know.

43:04.049 --> 43:06.885
And it's so unfair.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.688
'Cause he was such
a good kid.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.958
And we went through
so much growing up

43:12.991 --> 43:15.694
and I really thought
I got him through.

43:15.727 --> 43:20.699
I thought...
he was safe.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.301
He's going to get all
the help that he needs now.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.704
We're going to make sure
that he does.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.906
And nothing that you did
or didn't do

43:27.939 --> 43:29.340
would have prevented this.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.986
It's just that Eric...

43:41.019 --> 43:45.390
uh, he was the only
constant thing in my life.

43:48.827 --> 43:51.930
He was the only thing
I could ever really count on.

43:56.835 --> 43:59.170
That's not true anymore.

44:04.242 --> 44:06.712
Promise?

44:10.115 --> 44:18.023
'Cause I really need something
to hang on to right now.

44:18.056 --> 44:23.061
I'm not going anywhere.
