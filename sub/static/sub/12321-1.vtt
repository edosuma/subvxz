07:48.960 --> 07:52.555
As I was saying, the central thesis of
Miss Novak's book, <i>Down With Love...</i>

07:52.720 --> 07:56.030
...is that women will never be happy
until they become independent...

07:56.200 --> 07:59.749
...as individuals by achieving
equal participation in the work force.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.673
And how do you propose
women do this, Miss Novak?

08:02.840 --> 08:06.469
By saying, "Down with love."

08:06.640 --> 08:08.312
Love is a distraction.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.836
If women stopped falling in love,
it would be the end of the human race.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.989
BARBARA:
Not at all.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.917
I say women should refrain from love,
C.W., not sex.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.798
Isn't that the same thing?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.392
I mean, for women.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.870
It won't be, after they've mastered
the three levels in my book...

08:29.040 --> 08:32.191
...that will teach any woman
to live life the way a man does.

08:32.360 --> 08:37.195
Level 1 instructs women to abstain from
men altogether so they'll stop thinking...

08:37.360 --> 08:40.909
...that the pleasures experienced
during the sex act are related to love.

08:41.080 --> 08:45.870
They're not. As women will learn by
practicing the self-pleasuring technique...

08:46.040 --> 08:49.555
...that I've detailed in chapter 7,
entitled:

08:49.920 --> 08:51.353
"Up With Chocolate."

08:51.520 --> 08:55.399
You see, gentlemen, the female
experience is a biological reaction...

08:55.560 --> 08:59.109
...to chocolate that triggers the same
pleasurable responses in the brain...

08:59.280 --> 09:00.998
...as are triggered during sex.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.470
By substituting chocolate for sex,
the female will soon learn...

09:04.640 --> 09:07.313
...the difference between sex and love.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.234
Love for a man
will no longer occupy her mind.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.359
She will now find that she has the time
and the energy to move on to Level 2...

09:15.520 --> 09:19.229
...where taking on new challenges will
lead to the self-sufficience of Level 3...

09:19.400 --> 09:23.188
...where the woman becomes active in
the workplace and earns and achieves...

09:23.360 --> 09:27.751
...an unequivocal equality with men.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.358
And all this time the woman
is abstaining from sex?

09:34.520 --> 09:35.953
Heavens, no.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.477
By Level 3, she can have sex
whenever she likes, without love...

09:40.640 --> 09:45.953
...and enjoy it the way a man does,
"Ã  la carte."

09:48.320 --> 09:52.552

09:56.040 --> 09:59.476

straightforward men of Maine.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.394

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.398
Goodbye, Mr. Block.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.591
Have a candy bar for your trouble.
And thanks again for thinking of us.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.115
But I'm always thinking of you,
Miss Novak.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.555
I can't stop thinking of you.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.359
And I'd like you to reconsider
considering me.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.239
Even at a pay cut of 96.6 percent?

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.079
It's only money.
Besides, I've been on top for so long...

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.629
...I thought it might be nice
to try a new position.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.031
And you think you could be comfortable
in a position under a woman?

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.676
I look forward to it.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.798
Starting at the bottom,
working my way up slowly to the top.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.030
Still, I'm afraid that a man
of your experience...

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.556
...would be too distracted working
in a predominantly female workplace.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.318
Not at all. You see...

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.950
...I'm not really interested
in women Ã  la carte anymore.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.073
The next time I get involved
with a woman, it'll be to settle down.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.236
Well, I wouldn't want you stealing
one of the women...

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.597
...from my work force just to put her
away in a house in the suburbs.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.751
Oh, I wouldn't want that either.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.514
Miss Novak, I'm what you might call
a new man.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.631
Oh, is that so?

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.995
And I'm looking for a new kind
of love.

made me a new man."

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.872
Oh, sure.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.430
And to put yourself on top, you just
happened to have had to expose me...

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.956
...as Nancy Brown in your attempt
to win a Nobel Prize.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.232
I never said a word about Nancy Brown.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.960
And the only prize I wanted to win
was you.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.154
Crazy, isn't it?

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.432
After all our tricking each other,
I'm the one who wound up here...

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.354
...with the love letter, and you're the
one who wound up with the scoop.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.392
Still...

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.710
...I'll keep my eye
on the billboards.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.316
And maybe one day you'll do a piece on
how you became someone in between...

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.758
...the bashful brunette, Nancy Brown,
and the cool blond, Barbara Novak.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.673
That's a piece I could really go for.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.194
One.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.397
Five.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.709
Hmm.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.510
Someone between
a blond and a brunette?

[GASPING]

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.192
Scooped you again.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.510
I knew you would.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.829
I knew the minute I placed an ad
as an equal opportunity employer...

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.958
...you would be the first to apply.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.718
And I knew you knew.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.872
And you let me in
to ask you to marry me.

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.275
But you didn't know I'd say yes.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.199
BARBARA:
Vegas?

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:28.035
We can get married there on the spot.
I'm not letting you get away again. Ever.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.474
Oh, Catch.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.871

- Peter?
- Vikki?

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.951
Do you wanna marry me or not?

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.758
I'm not giving up my career.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.273
I wouldn't ask you to.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.873
Then it's a deal?

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.837
Deal!

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.796
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
it's official.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.269
The battle of the sexes is over.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.158
What's that? Don't believe me?

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.355
Well, here's the proof.
