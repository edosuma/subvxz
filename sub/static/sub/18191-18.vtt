WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.603
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE"...

00:02.636 --> 00:04.270
OKAY, SO YOU WANNA HEAR
THE CRAZIEST, MOST RANDOM
THING EVER?

00:04.304 --> 00:06.674
I KIND OF MADE OUT
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

00:06.706 --> 00:08.308
- I'M SOR-- DOMINIC?
- IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.211
- SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO LEO YET?
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE I WANT TO.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.480
YOU ALWAYS KNEW
HE HAD AN EDGE, RIGHT?

00:13.513 --> 00:17.484
HE HASN'T REALLY BEEN
THE SAME SINCE THE SURGERY.
AND MAYBE I HAVEN'T EITHER.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.320
Sara:
I JUST GOT OUT OF SOMETHING,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.388
AND I CAN'T COMMIT
TO ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.490
OH MY GOD.
HM, SORRY.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.591
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.361
April:
I THINK MY CANCER'S BACK.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.067
( weeping )

00:36.570 --> 00:37.737
I MEAN, I JUST HAD
A BLOOD TEST LAST WEEK

00:37.771 --> 00:39.106
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.575
COULD THINGS REALLY CHANGE
THIS QUICKLY?

00:41.609 --> 00:43.277
IT WAS ONE
BLOODY NOSE.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.612
NO ONE SAID
ANYTHING'S CHANGED.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.046
I KNOW BUT IT HAS
TO BE POSSIBLE

00:47.081 --> 00:48.783
FOR THIS STUFF TO JUST
COME BACK OVERNIGHT.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.484
LIKE, ONE DAY YOU'RE FINE
AND THE NEXT YOU'RE--

00:50.518 --> 00:52.051
STILL FINE.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.121
APRIL, STOP.
JUST WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.756
YOU CAN'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.091
( cellphone chimes )

00:58.125 --> 00:59.560
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING

00:59.593 --> 01:01.128
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMEWHERE TO BE...

01:01.161 --> 01:02.329
NO, I'M GOOD.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.498
- ( cellphone chimes )
- ( footsteps )

01:04.531 --> 01:05.799
Sara:
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.102
I WAS WITH SOMEBODY AND...

01:08.135 --> 01:10.204
I CAME AS QUICKLY
AS I COULD, I JUST...

01:10.236 --> 01:11.405
OH, I MEAN--

01:11.438 --> 01:12.706
NEVER MIND.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.709
WELL, THE ONLY BAD NEWS HERE
IS THAT MY HUSBAND AND I

01:15.742 --> 01:17.478
WILL BE GETTING A LATE START
ON OUR CAMPING TRIP

01:17.510 --> 01:20.114
AND WE'LL PROBABLY END UP
BY THE OUTHOUSE-- AGAIN.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.448
I'LL TRY NOT TO BLAME YOU.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.185
- SO--
- SHE'S FINE!

01:24.218 --> 01:25.385
YOU'RE FINE.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.353
- BUT THE NOSEBLEED?
- NOSEBLEEDS HAPPEN.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.823
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE WEATHER GETS DRIER.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.390
Dr. Hamburg:
I DID NOTICE THAT
YOUR PLATELET COUNT

01:30.424 --> 01:32.793
WAS A TEENY BIT OFF,
BUT...

01:32.826 --> 01:34.328
IT'S STILL
IN THE NORMAL RANGE.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.197
SO IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN STRESSED AT WORK.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.730
BUT YOU'RE STILL CONFIDENT?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.432
I WOULDN'T LET YOU LEAVE
IF I WASN'T.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.668
I AM 99% SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.703
OKAY?

01:42.735 --> 01:44.438
RELAX.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.509
SORRY FOR THE FALSE ALARM.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.878
JUST KEEPING YOU
ON YOUR TOES.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.879
( chuckles )

01:53.112 --> 01:54.147
COME HERE.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.884
OH...

01:57.116 --> 02:00.254
- ( theme music playing )
- ♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

02:00.287 --> 02:02.890
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

02:03.123 --> 02:07.894
♪ JUST RIGHT ♪

02:08.127 --> 02:12.800
♪ YOU COULD STAY ALL NIGHT
AND NEVER WANNA GO HOME ♪

02:12.832 --> 02:15.336
♪ 'CAUSE WE CAN'T STOP ♪

02:15.368 --> 02:16.836
♪ WE WON'T STOP. ♪

02:22.475 --> 02:24.545
SO SHE SAID 99%,

02:24.578 --> 02:26.881
WHICH I KNOW IS
A REALLY GOOD NUMBER,

02:26.913 --> 02:29.650
BUT I WAS SO SURE
IT WAS BACK.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.686
LIKE, I FELT IT
IN MY BODY

02:32.719 --> 02:34.521
OR I THOUGHT I DID.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.691
AND NOW IT JUST--
IT FEELS LIKE I...

02:39.492 --> 02:41.795
CAN'T TRUST
MY INSTINCTS ANYMORE.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.563
LIKE EVER SINCE I GOT CANCER,

02:43.597 --> 02:47.835
MY BODY IS JUST THIS
HUGE MYSTERY TO ME

02:47.867 --> 02:48.836
AND I HATE THAT.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.638
I HATE...

02:50.670 --> 02:52.872
NOT BEING ABLE
TO COUNT ON THINGS.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.175
WHICH IS WHY I TRY
AND SURROUND MYSELF

02:55.209 --> 02:57.811
WITH PEOPLE I CAN RELY ON.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.847
LIKE SOME OF YOU IN THIS ROOM.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.715
SO GLAD YOU'RE
OKAY, APRIL.

03:01.748 --> 03:06.287
JUST IN TIME FOR MY BAT MITZVAH
ON SATURDAY MORNING.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.921
( laughter, applause )

03:07.955 --> 03:10.356
WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT'S 17 YEARS TOO LATE,

03:10.390 --> 03:13.426
BUT HEY, MY PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.194
THEY'RE NOT IN A RUSH.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.230
I KNOW I DON'T REALLY SEEM
LIKE A RELIGIOUS PERSON.

03:17.264 --> 03:21.868
BUT, UM, THERE IS JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED

03:21.901 --> 03:25.939
THAT YOU START TO SEE THE VALUE
IN STUFF LIKE THIS.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.908
WHICH IS FUNNY TIMING,

03:27.942 --> 03:30.644
CONSIDERING I AM ABOUT
TO BECOME A WOMAN,

03:30.677 --> 03:33.680
ONE YEAR AFTER HAVING
BOTH OF MY OVARIES REMOVED.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.914
( laughter )

03:34.949 --> 03:36.917
LUCKILY, WE JEWS LOVE IRONY.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.985
( laughing )

03:42.889 --> 03:44.557
OH, HELLO, DEAR.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.259
HOW WAS YOUR DAY
AT SCHOOL?

03:46.293 --> 03:48.228
IT'S HIGH SCHOOL.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.899
SORRY, HOW WAS YOUR DAY
IN HELL?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.866
IT'S NOT EVEN OVER YET.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.271
MY MOM'S HOSTING THIS COLLEGE
PREP THING HERE TONIGHT.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.305
SO THIS GUY IS GONNA COME OVER
AND TALK ABOUT LIKE,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.474
THE APPLICATION PROCESS.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.943
OR YOU COULD COME WITH ME
TO THIS COOL LIVE MUSIC CLUB

04:03.978 --> 04:05.312
THAT JUST OPENED IN J.P.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.881
Natalie: WHAT?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.883
IT'S BEEN WEEKS SINCE
THAT TAILGATING PARTY

04:09.917 --> 04:11.251
I TOOK YOU TO,
YOUR MOM CAN'T

04:11.284 --> 04:12.519
STILL BE PISSED
ABOUT THAT.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.955
SHE'S NOT BUT SHE'D KILL ME
IF I MISSED TONIGHT.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.889
MAYBE TOMORROW?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.591
SURE, NO WORRIES.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.961
GOD, YOUR LIFE IS SO DIFFERENT
FROM HOW I GREW UP.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.031
HALF THE KIDS AT MY SCHOOL
DIDN'T EVEN GO TO COLLEGE.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.865
( scoffs )
WELL, YEAH.

04:25.899 --> 04:29.370
AT CHARTON,
COLLEGE ISN'T A CHOICE,

04:29.403 --> 04:30.971
IT'S LIKE A REQUIREMENT.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.774
AND AT LEAST MY MOM'S NOT
AS CRAZY AS GREER'S PARENTS.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.843
YOU'RE SEEING GREER AGAIN?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.711
I MEAN, JUST AS FRIENDS.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.581
SO YOU'RE SINGLE.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.284
WELL, IF YOU'RE READY TO GET
BACK OUT THERE AND MINGLE,

04:45.319 --> 04:49.923
I KNOW SOMETHING THAT COULD
GIVE YOU A LITTLE JUMPSTART.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.425
( both chuckle )

04:51.457 --> 04:52.992
- BREN?
- YEAH?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.028
I COULD USE YOUR HELP
STRAIGHTENING UP
OUT HERE.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.497
UH, JUST GIVE ME--

04:57.497 --> 04:58.531
Sara: WOW.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.033
( Sara stammers )

05:00.067 --> 05:02.769
I DON'T KNOW IF...

05:02.802 --> 05:04.637
HI, NATALIE.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.040
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.675
YEAH, I'M QUIET LIKE THAT.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.944
STEALTH.
KINDA LIKE THESE.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.312
THEY DON'T EVEN
LOOK FAKE, RIGHT?

05:13.346 --> 05:15.348
I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS OFF.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.550
YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY BEST.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.985
YEAH, PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HERE
IN HALF AN HOUR

05:19.019 --> 05:21.622
AND THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE RIGHT LOOK.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.889
YOU WANT MY TWO CENTS?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.591
IF SHE WEARS THAT
TO HER COLLEGE INTERVIEWS,

05:25.625 --> 05:28.696
SHE'LL GET IN WHEREVER
SHE WANTS.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.764
( chuckles )

05:35.769 --> 05:37.370
HEY.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.108
I TRIED CALLING
YOU YESTERDAY.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.009
YEAH, I KNOW, I WAS
REALLY BUSY, SO...

05:43.043 --> 05:45.345
YEAH, I GUESS I WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT IN TROUBLE

05:45.379 --> 05:46.980
AFTER THE RICHIE MIRANDA THING,
HUH?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.850
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.384
WHAT'S UP?

05:51.418 --> 05:52.786
( sighs )

05:52.819 --> 05:54.420
WELL, I, UH...

05:54.454 --> 05:57.591
WAS CALLING TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.060
FOR PUTTING YOU IN SUCH A...

06:00.093 --> 06:02.362
HORRIBLE POSITION
WITH YOUR JOB

06:02.396 --> 06:05.466
AND FOR THE CRAPPY THINGS
I SAID THAT NIGHT AND...

06:05.499 --> 06:09.136
FOR JUST BEING A JERK
IN GENERAL LATELY.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.370
WELL...
( clears throat )

06:11.404 --> 06:12.906
YOU'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH A LOT.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.841
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT MY MOM TOLD ME.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.745
IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS KEEPING
THAT FROM YOU INTENTIONALLY.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.012
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TALK TO YOU

06:20.047 --> 06:22.014
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.151
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.418
I WISH I KNEW.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.788
BUT I KNOW I MISS YOU.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.792
ME TOO.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.394
SO I'LL CALL YOU LATER?

06:34.427 --> 06:36.396
SURE, NEXT TIME
I'LL PICK UP.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.872
Man:
WHEN IT COMES TO COLLEGE
APPLICATIONS THESE DAYS,

06:45.906 --> 06:47.441
A KID NEEDS TO HAVE THE GRADES,

06:47.473 --> 06:48.641
THE TEST SCORES,

06:48.675 --> 06:50.644
AND THE EXTRACURRICULARS
TO HAVE A SHOT

06:50.677 --> 06:52.045
AT A TOP-TIER SCHOOL.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.480
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE AT LEAST
A 3.8 G.P.A.?

06:55.649 --> 06:58.185
AND HOW MANY HAVE TAKEN
FOUR OR MORE A.P. CLASSES?

06:59.452 --> 07:00.987
OKAY, GOOD.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.122
NOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE
VOLUNTEERING AT A NON-PROFIT,

07:03.156 --> 07:04.158
OR BETTER YET,

07:04.190 --> 07:05.492
STARTING YOUR OWN?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.095
Ford: WHAT?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.663
SOME INNER-CITY KIDS
WANT TO LEARN HOW TO KNIT.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.565
COOL.
SO THE NEXT STEP IS

07:12.598 --> 07:14.802
MAKING YOUR DREAM LIST
OF WHERE YOU WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.470
YOUR OWN TOP 10.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.137
PARENTS, READ THAT LIST

07:18.172 --> 07:21.108
AND KNOW HOW YOUR KIDS ARE
SPENDING THEIR TIME.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.209
THEY'RE JUNIORS NOW.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
MISTAKES THEY MAKE TODAY
MAY NOT BE FIXABLE

07:24.478 --> 07:26.112
BY THE TIME SCHOOLS
MAKE THEIR DECISIONS.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.449
April:
AND THEN HE GOES...

07:29.483 --> 07:31.018
- "I KNOW I MISS YOU."
- ( cellphone chimes )

07:31.050 --> 07:33.487
AND I'M LIKE, WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.057
BETH, ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.658
YEAH, LEO'S
A TOTAL DOUCHE.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.127
SORRY, JACQUELINE WANTS ME
TO HIRE A REPLACEMENT

07:41.161 --> 07:44.096
FOR MYSELF
AND KEEPS SENDING ME
MORE AND MORE REQUIREMENTS.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.132
SHE HAS TO BE PRETTY,
INTELLIGENT,

07:46.165 --> 07:49.468
- FASHIONABLE, ORGANIZED.
- HMM, HOW'D YOU GET THE JOB?

07:49.502 --> 07:51.838
( chuckles )
HILARIOUS.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.240
OH, UM, SORRY,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
I TOLD GRAHAM HE COULD
CRASH OUR DATE.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.144
I KEEP BAILING ON HIM
BECAUSE OF WORK.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.579
HEY, GIRL.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.612
- HEY.
- AWW...

07:59.646 --> 08:01.747
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
- RIGHT?

08:01.781 --> 08:04.117
DIDN'T I SEE THESE
AT YOUR PLACE YESTERDAY?

08:05.117 --> 08:06.220
YES.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.653
WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW,

08:07.687 --> 08:09.790
REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE.
IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE DOMINIC

08:09.822 --> 08:11.257
WANTED THEM ANYWAY.
HE JUST GOT 'EM.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.793
WHY'D HE BUY FLOWERS
HE DIDN'T WANT?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.795
OH...

08:14.827 --> 08:16.196
UH...

08:16.230 --> 08:18.798
WHAT?
IT'S FINE.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.500
A GIRL SENT THEM TO HIM.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.071
REALLY?
WHO?

08:24.103 --> 08:25.572
I HAVE NO IDEA.
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.206
THE DUDE HAS BEEN
HIDING STUFF.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.975
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
HIS DAFT PUNK BOOK'S
ABOUT TO COME OUT?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.245
HE'S HAVING
A BOOK SIGNING SATURDAY NIGHT.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.212
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD,
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.682
HE PROBABLY TOLD
THIS MYSTERY FLOWER GIRL.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.183
THEY TEXT NONSTOP.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.885
HE WAS GETTING TEXT MESSAGES

08:38.918 --> 08:40.620
WHEN WE WERE
AT THE HOSPITAL YESTERDAY.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.657
OH, I'M FINE.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.192
THE DOCTOR'S LIKE 99% SURE
IT'S NOTHING, SO...

08:46.225 --> 08:47.527
Graham:
OKAY, GOOD.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.096
I GUESS THAT'S
SOMEWHAT REASSURING.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.932
- SOMEWHAT?
- GRAHAM...

08:51.965 --> 08:53.734
I'M JUST SAYING,
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING,

08:53.767 --> 08:56.669
1% IS ONLY HELPFUL
IN UNDERSTANDING THE LIKELIHOOD

08:56.702 --> 08:58.304
THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.039
IF YOU'RE THE 1%
THAT IT HAPPENS TO,

09:00.072 --> 09:03.543
THEN FOR YOU,
THE CANCER'S TOTALLY 100% BACK.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.114
- IN THEORY.
- YEAH.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.149
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.985
SEE, SHE WAS
ALREADY WORRIED.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.094
( phone ringing )

09:54.126 --> 09:55.095
HELLO?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.096
April:
Oh hi, hey.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.230
UM, DR. HAMBURG, HI.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.100
APRIL, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.902
Uh, yeah, totally.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.104
I HAD A SUPER QUICK QUESTION.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.774
UH, SO I FOUND
THIS BRUISE ON MY ARM,
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.208
I wasn't even gonna
call you about it,

10:09.241 --> 10:11.077
especially not this early,
but I figured, you know,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.380
YOU'RE CAMPING, PROBABLY UP
TO SEE THE SUNRISE, RIGHT?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.383
( chuckles )
NOT EXACTLY.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.250
I'M SO SORRY.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.355
BUT SINCE I HAVE YOU NOW,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.990
HOW DO I TELL IF THIS BRUISE
IS A REGULAR ONE

10:24.024 --> 10:25.325
OR A CANCER BRUISE?

10:25.359 --> 10:29.296
It's sort of blue
and purple-y and yellow.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.398
( sighs )
DOES THAT MEAN
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

10:31.630 --> 10:33.966
WELL, THE COLOR OF YOUR BRUISE
DOESN'T TELL ME ANYTHING

10:34.000 --> 10:36.736
BUT THIS CONVERSATION TELLS ME
THAT YOU HAVE ANXIETY.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.806
But, April, you're gonna have
to deal with the possibility

10:39.840 --> 10:42.375
OF RELAPSE FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.977
You have to learn
how to control your anxiety.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.145
HOW?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.813
Some people use
anti-depressants,

10:47.847 --> 10:50.149
OTHER PEOPLE USE
MEDICAL MARIJUANA,

10:50.182 --> 10:52.818
some people work it out
through exercise,

10:52.852 --> 10:54.421
yoga, meditation.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.355
SOME PEOPLE FIND SPIRITUALITY.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.191
WHAT IF NONE
OF THOSE THINGS WORK?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.326
THERE'S THAT ANXIETY AGAIN.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.428
Why don't we start
with exercise?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.998
GET OUT RIGHT NOW,
GO GET SOME FRESH AIR.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.899
Sara:
I LOVE THAT YOU'RE
JOINING ME FOR THIS.

11:06.932 --> 11:10.437
EVEN IF IT HAD
TO BE DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.172
YOU WANNA TELL ME MORE
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.774
April:
I FEEL LIKE TALKING
ABOUT MY ANXIETY

11:14.807 --> 11:16.909
IS PROBABLY NOT GONNA HELP ME
HAVE LESS OF IT.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.879
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.679
HOW'S WORK?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.682
YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

11:23.716 --> 11:25.384
WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

11:25.418 --> 11:27.687
YES, SOMETHING
DEFINITELY HAPPENED.

11:29.722 --> 11:30.791
I, UM...

11:30.823 --> 11:32.859
WHAT'S THE WORD YOU GIRLS
ALWAYS USE?

11:32.893 --> 11:35.095
I... I HOOKED UP
WITH A MAN AT WORK.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.397
OH MY GOD.
REALLY?

11:37.431 --> 11:39.466
WAIT, LIKE,
A PATIENT?

11:39.698 --> 11:42.469
- ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
- NO, APRIL!

11:42.701 --> 11:45.172
HE'S A MAN I SHARE
A WAITING ROOM WITH.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.173
A LAWYER.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.707
( both laugh )

11:48.741 --> 11:50.476
OKAY, HOLD ON.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.711
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:52.745 --> 11:54.713
NO, I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT DETAILS.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.283
ARE YOU GUYS--
A) DATING.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.388
OR B) JUST OTHER STUFF?

12:02.855 --> 12:03.856
B.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.424
I'M PRETTY SURE
JUST B.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.993
MOM!

12:08.227 --> 12:09.863
I DON'T KNOW, I--
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN FEELING

12:09.895 --> 12:12.731
LIKE I'VE GOT
TO EMBRACE LIFE AND ACT
ON MY INSTINCTS.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.067
AND NOW I THINK
I WOULD RATHER TALK
ABOUT MY ANXIETY.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.203
- OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.
- ( exhales )

12:18.804 --> 12:19.972
YOU, UM...

12:20.005 --> 12:22.408
THINK ABOUT
THE ANXIETY MEDICATION
ANY MORE?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.510
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--

12:24.744 --> 12:28.014
I SPENT MONTHS TAKING
ALL THOSE PILLS, YOU KNOW?

12:28.048 --> 12:31.451
TAKING MORE DRUGS IS
THE LAST THING I WANNA DO.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.753
FOR NOW I GUESS
I'LL JUST FOCUS

12:33.787 --> 12:35.822
ON THE ONE PLACE
I ALWAYS FIND ZEN.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.129
- APRIL.
- WHOA.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.431
UH...

12:44.463 --> 12:47.299
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE NAPPING.
- NO, I WAS JUST--

12:47.334 --> 12:49.769
--MAKING ME SECOND-GUESS
WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.270
LISTEN, I HAVE A LOT
GOING ON TODAY

12:51.303 --> 12:53.405
AND I NEED YOUR HELP
TO COVER A FEW THINGS.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.543
I FIGURED YOU OWE ME
FROM WHEN I SAVED YOUR CAREER.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.077
SO...

12:58.110 --> 13:01.114
START BY CONFIRMING THE DATES
ON THE POLITICAL CALENDAR

13:01.148 --> 13:02.515
AND THEN EDIT
DANNY'S ARTICLE

13:02.548 --> 13:04.417
ON THE CUTS
TO THE PRISON-GUARD BUDGET.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.818
IT'S RIVETING.

13:05.851 --> 13:06.552
COULD BE MORE SO.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.321
ALSO, TAKE A LOOK
AT THE ARTICLE

13:08.355 --> 13:10.322
ON THE DANGERS
OF THE MICROWAVE.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.091
ANOTHER NEW STUDY
JUST CAME OUT.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.561
BUT I USE A MICROWAVE
ALL THE TIME.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.096
AND YOU GOT CANCER,
SO...

13:18.365 --> 13:20.000
( sighs )

13:20.033 --> 13:22.836
Sara:
MOM, YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THIS GUY LAST NIGHT.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.538
I'M TELLING YOU,
BRENNA IS BEHIND
THE CURVE HERE.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.807
I MEAN, EVEN FORD
HAS A 4.0. FORD!

13:28.841 --> 13:31.043
I TOLD YOU THAT GIRL
WAS A GENIUS.

13:31.076 --> 13:33.312
YEAH, WELL, THAT GENIUS
IS GONNA GET IN

13:33.346 --> 13:35.014
TO WHATEVER COLLEGE
SHE WANTS.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.216
BRENNA MAY NOT
GET IN ANYWHERE.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.985
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.488
MOM, THE COUNSELOR SAID
YOU HAVE TO KNOW

13:41.520 --> 13:43.490
WHAT YOUR KID IS DOING
ALL THE TIME.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.292
WELL, I KNOW WHAT MY KID
IS DOING.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.461
SHE'S WORKING
IN A TATTOO PARLOR,
HANGING OUT WITH...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.830
NOT-SO-GREAT INFLUENCES,
LIKE NATALIE.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.232
I NEVER INTERFERED WITH YOU
WHEN YOU WERE BRENNA'S AGE

13:53.265 --> 13:55.835
AND SOMEHOW YOU MANAGED
TO COBBLE TOGETHER

13:55.869 --> 13:57.836
A LIFE FOR YOURSELF.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.140
I BELIEVED IN LETTING YOU
MAKE YOUR OWN MISTAKES.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.875
OKAY, WELL MAYBE
YOU SHOULD DO THAT AGAIN,

14:02.908 --> 14:04.311
LET ME MAKE
MY OWN MISTAKES.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.613
SUIT YOURSELF.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.481
Sara:
OH, NATALIE,
YOU ON YOUR WAY OUT?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.250
THAT'S PROBABLY
GOOD TIMING,

14:11.283 --> 14:12.519
I WAS HOPING TO GET
BRENNA ALONE

14:12.552 --> 14:14.354
SO WE COULD GO OVER
THIS COLLEGE LIST.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.490
ACTUALLY, MOM, WE WERE
ON OUR WAY OUT, SO...

14:17.524 --> 14:20.259
REALLY? WHERE TO?

14:20.293 --> 14:23.096
UM, DINNER
AT THE CHARLES.

14:23.129 --> 14:26.566
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.001
MOM AND I WERE GOING
TO THE CHARLES TOO.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.604
- SERIOUSLY?
- SERIOUSLY?

14:30.636 --> 14:32.072
SERIOUSLY.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.140
YEAH, WE CAN GO OVER
THE LIST THERE.
IT'LL BE FUN.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.909
MY TREAT.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.615
( loud chattering )

14:46.620 --> 14:48.388
WHAT SHOULD I TELL JADE?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.456
SHE'S WAITING FOR US
AT THE BAR.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.424
JUST TELL HER WE GOT
HIJACKED,

14:52.459 --> 14:54.961
AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING
A FREE DINNER OUT OF IT.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.897
WELCOME TO TRIVIA NIGHT!

14:57.931 --> 14:59.499
Natalie:
TRIVIA NIGHT?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.567
OH, HOW FUN!

15:01.600 --> 15:02.902
LET'S PLAY A ROUND.

15:02.936 --> 15:06.038
WHAT? IT CAN'T HURT
TO PRACTICE TRIVIA.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.907
WELL, YOU'RE GETTING READY
FOR YOUR S.A.T.s.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
OKAY...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.477
BORING CATEGORIES--

15:11.510 --> 15:14.681
LITERATURE, HISTORY,
POLITICS.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.615
OH, POP CULTURE!

15:16.649 --> 15:18.051
EH, IT'S KIND OF
A HARD ONE.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.120
NAME A MEMBER
OF O.J. SIMPSON'S LEGAL TEAM.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.621
ROBERT KARDASHIAN.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.124
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

15:24.157 --> 15:26.525
KAR-DASH-IAN.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.028
( Brenna laughs )

15:28.061 --> 15:31.965
OOH, HERE'S ONE I KNOW
FROM ASTRONOMY.

15:31.998 --> 15:36.403
WHAT IS THE SECOND PLANET
FROM THE SUN?

15:37.636 --> 15:38.672
BOOM.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.706
( giggling )

15:43.409 --> 15:45.412
IT'S URANUS.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.213
NO, IT'S VENUS.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.450
BUT URANUS IS FUNNIER.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.620
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
UNDERSTOOD WHY SOME GIRLS

15:53.653 --> 15:55.621
THINK IT'S SO FUNNY
TO ACT DUMB.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.625
Host:
AND THAT IS ROUND ONE.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.995
DON'T FORGET TO DOUBLE DOWN
IF YOU'RE FEELING LUCKY.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.567
MY LIFE WAS GOING ON FINE,
ALL COOL, YOU KNOW.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.738
AND THEN I TOOK A BLOOD TEST

16:11.971 --> 16:15.741
AND I FOUND OUT THAT I HAD
STAGE THREE OVARIAN CANCER.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.243
MY PARENTS WERE LIKE,

16:17.277 --> 16:19.412
"A THREE, JUST A THREE?
YOU COULDN'T DO ANY BETTER?"

16:19.446 --> 16:21.213
( laughing )

16:21.246 --> 16:24.717
THEN AFTER GOING
THROUGH THE CHEMO AND, UM...

16:24.750 --> 16:27.019
GOING INTO REMISSION,

16:27.052 --> 16:29.989
I FOUND I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.524
I FELT LIKE I WAS STILL SICK.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.495
ALWAYS WAITING
FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.730
OKAY, I WAS A BASKET CASE.

16:37.764 --> 16:42.668
SO MY MOM BASICALLY FORCED ME
TO COME TALK TO OUR RABBI.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.739
COMING HERE, IT, UM...

16:45.772 --> 16:47.440
IT SAVED ME.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.509
I GUESS THAT'S
HOW LIFE WORKS, RIGHT?

16:50.543 --> 16:55.782
WE DON'T REALLY ASK FOR HELP
UNTIL WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM,

16:56.014 --> 16:57.750
LOOKING UP.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.221
SO ANYWAY,

17:01.254 --> 17:04.022
THANKS, DUDE,

17:04.057 --> 17:05.625
FOR EVERYTHING.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.461
THANK YOU.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.531
- ( applause )
- MAZEL TOV.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.038
I'M NOT RELIGIOUS,
ARE YOU?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.040
NOT REALLY.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.076
YEAH.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.778
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN GOD.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.211
BUT I'M WILLING TO,

17:26.246 --> 17:28.147
IF HE'LL HELP ME
PASS THE L.S.A.T.s NEXT WEEK.

17:28.181 --> 17:32.818
I KEEP TELLING HIM
THIS IS HIS FINAL CHANCE.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.555
I MEAN, HE REALLY BLEW IT
ON THE LAST ONE.

17:35.587 --> 17:38.791
HE BLEW IT WITH ME TOO.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.728
ONE LAST CHANCE, GOD.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.330
YEAH, I COULD REALLY USE
SOME HELP RIGHT AROUND NOW.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.381
HI, SORRY.
YOU'RE SHAUNA'S RABBI, RIGHT?

18:01.413 --> 18:03.782
- RABBI RICK.
- APRIL.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.286
I'M NOT JEWISH.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.788
BUT I REALLY LIKE
WHAT I'M SEEING HERE.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.458
EVERYBODY JUST SEEMS
SO HAPPY.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.794
MAKES ME WONDER IF THERE'S
A SIGN-UP SHEET I CAN
ADD MY NAME TO.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.564
WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE ASKING EXACTLY?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.632
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF JUDAISM IS FOR ME,

18:19.665 --> 18:23.368
BUT I THINK I WANNA START
BELIEVING IN GOD.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.770
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION FIRST.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.506
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS KEEPING YOU
FROM BELIEVING?

18:26.538 --> 18:30.108
HONESTLY, I'VE NEVER
REALLY BEEN MUCH OF A BELIEVER.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.511
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I SPENT
ALL THAT TIME IN THE HOSPITAL

18:32.545 --> 18:36.148
GOING THROUGH CHEMO AND...

18:36.182 --> 18:37.817
JUST NEVER FOUND GOD.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.819
I LOOKED, BUT, UM--

18:40.854 --> 18:42.855
I EVEN WENT
TO THE CHAPEL ONCE.

18:42.888 --> 18:47.125
BUT YEAH, HE WASN'T THERE.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.627
NOT FOR ME.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.497
WAS ANYBODY
THERE FOR YOU?

18:50.529 --> 18:52.365
AT THE CHAPEL?

18:52.397 --> 18:53.432
YEAH.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.901
DID THAT PERSON
HELP YOU?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.269
YEAH, HE DID.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.873
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
WHO GOD SENT.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.840
YOU KNOW,

19:01.875 --> 19:04.676
RELIGION IS SEPARATE
FROM GOD.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.546
IT'S ONE WAY
TO CONNECT WITH GOD.

19:06.578 --> 19:10.148
BUT RELIGION,
THAT'S A WHOLE WAY OF LIFE.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.219
IT'S MORE OF
A LONG-TERM SOLUTION.

19:13.252 --> 19:15.288
IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.756
RIGHT.

19:16.788 --> 19:17.891
WELL, THANK YOU.

19:17.923 --> 19:18.924
OF COURSE.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.162
STILL ANGSTING OUT
ABOUT THAT BLOOD TEST, HUH?

19:23.195 --> 19:24.329
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.664
I'VE BEEN THERE.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.501
AND, YOU KNOW, A QUICK FIX
ISN'T ALWAYS SUCH A BAD THING.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.710
( whispers )
A POT COOKIE?

19:37.743 --> 19:39.945
WORKS EVERY TIME.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.549
BUT WHAT ABOUT
ALL OF THE TALK ABOUT
HOW GOD HELPED YOU?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.751
HE DID, HE DOES.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.587
THEY'RE NOT
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, MAN.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.660
Sara:
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.827
I'M PUSHING MY DAUGHTER AWAY,
I KNOW ALL THAT, MOM.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.631
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.865
( sighs )

19:59.898 --> 20:01.401
IT JUST PAINS ME
TO SEE BRENNA

20:01.433 --> 20:03.236
NOT LIVING UP
TO HER POTENTIAL.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.471
UP TO WHOSE POTENTIAL?

20:10.343 --> 20:11.510
MORNING, BRENNA.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.948
Sara:
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.683
OH, YOU KNOW,
DRUGS, CASUAL SEX,

20:17.717 --> 20:19.919
MAYBE SOME STREET CRIME,
THE USHE.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.554
SOUNDS LIKE A FUN AFTERNOON.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.788
Sara:
BRENNA, COME ON.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.324
I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T DONE
A VERY GOOD JOB

20:24.356 --> 20:25.892
OF CONVEYING TO YOU
WHAT AN AMAZING,

20:25.924 --> 20:28.227
INTELLIGENT PERSON
I THINK YOU ARE.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.295
REALLY, MOM?

20:29.328 --> 20:31.530
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU
DON'T THINK THAT

20:31.564 --> 20:34.933
AMAZING, INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
GET GRADES LIKE I DO.

20:34.968 --> 20:38.237
AND AMAZING, INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
DON'T WORK IN TATTOO PARLORS

20:38.270 --> 20:40.606
AND WATCH REALITY TV SHOWS
ABOUT PAWN-SHOP OWNERS

20:40.640 --> 20:42.541
AND PARKING POLICE, RIGHT?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.711
GRANDMA,
YOU COMING?

20:46.980 --> 20:49.414
YOU KNOW, THOSE SHOWS
ARE REALLY GOOD

20:49.449 --> 20:50.817
ONCE YOU GET
INTO THEM.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.489
Beth: UGH.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.590
JACQUELINE KEEPS ASKING ME
TO SEND HER QUESTIONS

20:58.625 --> 21:00.727
FOR HER INTERVIEW
WITH THE BRAZILIAN.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.828
IT'S NOT AN INTERVIEW,
IT'S A BIKINI WAX.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.529
LEARN TO READ
YOUR OWN SCHEDULE.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.732
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD GO
TO DOMINIC'S BOOK SIGNING?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.701
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
INVITE US.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.304
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT
MEETING THIS MYSTERY GIRL,

21:11.336 --> 21:12.704
WHOEVER SHE IS.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.741
SO ARE YOU, LIKE,
HAVING FEELINGS FOR DOMINIC?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.678
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THINGS
WITH YOU AND LEO ARE
WEIRD RIGHT NOW--

21:18.711 --> 21:19.945
NO NO.
GOD, NO.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.615
I JUST-- I NEED SOMETHING
TO FIXATE ON...

21:22.648 --> 21:24.049
WHEN I'M ANXIOUS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.884
AND THE MIDDLE
OF THE DAY.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.987
- AND MORNING.
- MM-HMM.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.059
April:
OH MY GOD.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.961
YOU REMEMBER MEG
FROM MY SUPPORT GROUP?

21:35.994 --> 21:38.931
- YEAH.
- SHE JUST

21:38.964 --> 21:40.833
HAD A BLOOD TEST
A FEW HOURS AGO

21:40.866 --> 21:44.002
AND FOUND OUT
HER CANCER'S BACK.

21:44.037 --> 21:47.073
I JUST SAW HER THIS MORNING
AND SHE SEEMED FINE.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.575
SO WHAT, IT'S JUST BACK?
LIKE, OUT OF THE BLUE?

21:49.608 --> 21:51.611
YEAH, BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.779
WHICH IS WHY I'M SUCH
A MESS RIGHT NOW.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.781
HMM.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.349
( inhales )

21:57.383 --> 22:00.486
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.387
ALL RIGHT, APRIL,
I'M CUTTING YOU OFF.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.458
I AM GONNA GO
TO THE BATHROOM

22:05.490 --> 22:07.393
AND THEN WHEN I GET BACK
WE'RE GONNA GO

22:07.426 --> 22:10.563
TO DOMINIC'S
BOOK SIGNING, OKAY?

22:10.596 --> 22:12.097
ALL RIGHT.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.096
( groans )

22:43.128 --> 22:45.998
HEY, NICE HELMET.
DID YOU MAKE THAT?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.073
MAYBE THIS WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.142
I'M, LIKE, HAVING
TROUBLE BREATHING.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.877
OKAY, LET'S GET YOU
A GLASS OF WINE.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.980
UM, CAN YOU MIX
THAT WITH POT?

23:03.615 --> 23:05.084
WHAT?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.519
( laughs )
I HAD A TINY LITTLE BIT

23:07.553 --> 23:09.087
OF A POT COOKIE
THAT SHAUNA GAVE ME.

23:09.122 --> 23:12.090
APRIL CARVER!
SERIOUSLY?!

23:12.125 --> 23:14.559
I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S WORKING, SO...

23:14.594 --> 23:16.596
CLEARLY NOT, IF YOU'RE
STILL THIS STRESSED.

23:16.628 --> 23:17.797
HOW MUCH DID YOU EAT?

23:17.829 --> 23:18.964
UM...

23:21.134 --> 23:23.435
YEAH, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.138
( grumbles )
HERE?

23:26.172 --> 23:27.472
MM-HMM.

23:29.107 --> 23:30.843
( sighs )

23:33.112 --> 23:34.846
MORE.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.148
YOU'RE SUCH
A PEER PRESSURER.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.416
NO NO, I'M SUCH
A FRIEND.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.086
OKAY, TRUST ME,
I WOULD JOIN YOU

23:40.118 --> 23:41.686
IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
ON CALL FOR JACQUELINE.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.021
( laughs )

23:44.123 --> 23:45.124
- HEY.
- HI.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.894
I HAVE THE PERFECT IDEA
FOR TONIGHT.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.128
UH, THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON
OF "TWIN PEAKS"?

23:50.163 --> 23:51.130
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

23:51.163 --> 23:52.464
IT'S ALWAYS
THE PLAN.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.699
- ( phone rings )
- I LIKE ROUTINE.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.902
YEAH, OKAY,
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.002
SORRY.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.207
JACQUELINE, HI.

24:03.675 --> 24:06.211
OKAY.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.781
HAVE YOU TRIED
PUTTING SOME ALOE

24:09.816 --> 24:12.984
ON THAT AREA?

24:15.555 --> 24:18.089
WELL, I'M KIND
OF IN A PUBLIC PLACE

24:18.124 --> 24:21.560
SO I CAN'T REALLY
WALK YOU THROUGH IT HERE.

24:21.594 --> 24:24.096
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.897
YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO GO DO
RIGHT NOW.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.732
WAIT WAIT, ARE YOU LEAVING?
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
HANG OUT LATER?

24:27.767 --> 24:30.036
I'M SORRY,
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
DINNER TOMORROW?

24:30.068 --> 24:31.170
HAVE FUN.
OKAY.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.472
( sighs )

24:34.507 --> 24:36.174
WELL, I'LL BE
IN THE SELF-HELP SECTION.

24:48.855 --> 24:49.855
Dominic: APRIL?

24:49.888 --> 24:51.523
DOMINIC, HI, HEY.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.859
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.528
UM, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.698
I JUST WANTED
TO SUPPORT YOU.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.900
IS THAT OKAY?

25:00.932 --> 25:02.134
DO YOU NOT WANT ME HERE?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.603
'CAUSE I COULD GO,
I CAN--

25:03.635 --> 25:06.038
I MEAN, IF THERE ARE,
LIKE, PEOPLE HERE

25:06.071 --> 25:07.539
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MEET.

25:07.573 --> 25:10.076
OH MY GOD.
SHE'S HERE, ISN'T SHE?

25:10.108 --> 25:13.112
- WHO?
- WHOEVER IT IS YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.752
- THAT'S YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?
- NO.

25:20.786 --> 25:24.957
NO, THAT IS MY MOTHER.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.961
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
IN PRISON.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.830
OH MY GOD,
DID SHE BREAK OUT?

25:31.864 --> 25:34.532
NO NO, SHE WAS RELEASED
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.269
I'VE BEEN HELPING HER
GET SETTLED.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.305
YOU DON'T SOUND
HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.740
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON WHO KNOWS ABOUT
THE WHOLE PRISON THING.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.209
GRAHAM THINKS SHE'S
BEEN LIVING IN MARYLAND.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.977
GOT ANYTHING I CAN
DO TO HELP?

25:45.010 --> 25:45.845
DOM?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.880
( laughs )

25:47.913 --> 25:50.650
LOOK AT YOU.
OH, I COULDN'T
BE MORE PROUD.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.951
YOU'RE A REAL AUTHOR!

25:52.984 --> 25:54.220
OH...

25:54.252 --> 25:56.955
UM, APRIL, THIS IS
MY MOM MARIANNE.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.624
MOM, APRIL.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.259
AND HOW ARE YOU?

26:00.292 --> 26:03.128
I'M FINE.
DON'T I LOOK FINE?

26:05.030 --> 26:06.965
- Man:
MR. RUSSO?
- OH.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.734
THEY NEED ME
TO GO SIGN SOME BOOKS.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.869
ARE YOU REALLY ALL RIGHT?

26:10.903 --> 26:15.907
YEAH, IN FACT I AM
BETTER THAN ALL RIGHT.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.277
I FEEL GOOD.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.313
I GUESS, GOOD AS--

26:20.346 --> 26:22.949
AS MUCH GOOD AS
ALL RIGHT IS.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.851
BUT I'M...
( clicks tongue )

26:27.019 --> 26:30.021
GO, UH, I'LL BE FINE
HERE WITH APRIL.

26:32.057 --> 26:35.927
SO THERE'S NOTHING MEDICAL
TO EXPLAIN THE HEADACHES,

26:35.961 --> 26:37.296
THE DEPRESSION?

26:37.329 --> 26:41.901
I'VE ALSO HAD THESE KIND OF,
LIKE, BURSTS OF ANGER.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.869
IF YOUR TUMOR
HAD BEEN COMPROMISING
YOUR CEREBRAL CORTEX,

26:44.903 --> 26:48.007
WHICH PLAYS A KEY ROLE
IN PERCEPTIONAL AWARENESS
AND THOUGHT,

26:48.039 --> 26:49.775
THEN POSSIBLY.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.876
BUT FOR YOU,
THIS WASN'T THE CASE.

26:51.911 --> 26:54.713
WELL, MAYBE THE SURGERY
DID SOMETHING TO MY BRAIN.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.082
OR THE COMA.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.983
SURE, I SUPPOSE
IT'S POSSIBLE.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.384
ANYTHING IS.

26:59.617 --> 27:02.654
WELL, CAN YOU
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

27:02.688 --> 27:04.824
PROBABLY NOT, NO.

27:04.856 --> 27:08.760
SOME BRAIN INJURY CAN HAPPEN
WITH YOUR KIND OF SURGERY.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.630
AND FOR YOUR MEDS,
EVEN IF THEY'RE MAKING
YOU FEEL BAD,

27:11.663 --> 27:15.000
YOU STILL NEED
TO TAKE THEM. SO NO,
NOT AT THIS TIME.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.403
( fading away )
AND FRANKLY THESE ARE
MEDICATIONS

27:17.635 --> 27:19.939
YOU PROBABLY WILL BE TAKING
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE...

27:19.971 --> 27:22.407
I LOVE THE CLASSICS.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.910
I ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT
OF THE PAST YEAR READING THEM.

27:24.943 --> 27:26.778
MMM, I BET.

27:26.811 --> 27:31.349
OH MAN, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE
FOR SOME TIME TO JUST...

27:31.384 --> 27:34.420
LOCK MYSELF AWAY AND READ.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.954
I MEAN...

27:35.988 --> 27:38.423
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
JUST TO HAVE THE TIME.

27:39.858 --> 27:43.028
I MEAN, WELL, THERE IS
SUCH A THING AS...

27:43.061 --> 27:45.163
DOING TOO MUCH TIME.

27:45.197 --> 27:49.067
I MEAN, HAVING IT.
HAVING TOO MUCH TIME.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.871
RIGHT, YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
LITERALLY BE LOCKED UP.

27:51.903 --> 27:54.039
BECAUSE THEN IT
SORT OF TAKES THE FUN OUT

27:54.073 --> 27:56.107
OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE.
BELIEVE ME.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.878
UM, YOU WOULDN'T BE
MAKING FUN

27:59.912 --> 28:02.213
OF ME BEING
INCARCERATED, WOULD YOU?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.849
'CAUSE IF YOU ARE,
I MIGHT HAVE TO BREAK
YOUR LEGS.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.922
I'M SO SORRY.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.157
NO NO NO,
I WAS KIDDING.
I WAS KIDDING.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.392
( chuckles )

28:13.425 --> 28:15.795
NO, I'M GLAD
THAT DOMINIC TOLD YOU.

28:15.827 --> 28:18.830
IT'S NICE THAT HE HAS
SOMEONE NICE TO TALK TO.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.132
AND YOU SEEM NICE.

28:20.165 --> 28:24.170
A LITTLE QUIRKY,
BUT SO AM I.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.837
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY DOM?

28:27.038 --> 28:28.273
HMM.

28:28.307 --> 28:31.143
AND THEN WE WERE
ON THIS BREAK

28:31.176 --> 28:34.079
AND I SLEPT WITH A GUY
FROM MY SUPPORT GROUP.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.381
- HMM...
- ONE TIME.

28:35.413 --> 28:39.351
ONE TIME.
I MEAN, OKAY--
ONE TIME THEN.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.387
A FEW TIMES SINCE.
JUST...

28:42.421 --> 28:44.089
ANYWAY--

28:44.123 --> 28:47.393
YEAH, DOM JUST HAS
NEVER FORGIVEN ME.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.060
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
HE EVER WILL.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.029
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT SOUNDS LIKE

28:51.063 --> 28:54.967
THAT EVEN IF HE DOESN'T,
YOU SHOULD FORGIVE YOURSELF.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.269
YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE
REALLY COMPLICATED

28:58.304 --> 29:01.173
WITH ME AND DOM, AS I'M SURE
THAT YOU CAN GUESS.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.875
WE USED TO BE REALLY CLOSE.

29:03.909 --> 29:08.114
SEE, I CONVINCED MYSELF
THAT WHAT I WAS DOING

29:08.146 --> 29:10.148
WASN'T REALLY THAT BAD.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.085
I MEAN, I WAS JUST COVERING
THE TRACKS OF MY BOSS

29:13.118 --> 29:15.488
FOR THIS FINANCIAL THING.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.490
AND I GOT CAUGHT.

29:17.522 --> 29:23.128
AND THE IDEA
OF TELLING HIM--
I JUST...

29:23.162 --> 29:25.431
I COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF...

29:25.463 --> 29:27.333
( sighs )

29:27.365 --> 29:28.968
TO TELL HIM
I'M A CRIMINAL.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.371
SO I LIED TO HIM.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.973
I LIED TO MY SON.

29:35.007 --> 29:39.511
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
THE THING I REGRET
THE MOST.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.948
AND THAT'S THE THING
HE HASN'T FORGIVEN ME FOR.

29:42.981 --> 29:46.050
BUT...

29:46.085 --> 29:47.952
ALL YOU CAN DO IS
KEEP SHOWING UP,

29:47.987 --> 29:50.189
READY TO BE FORGIVEN,

29:50.221 --> 29:53.159
AND HOPE THAT ONE DAY
HE'LL BE READY TOO.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.929
WOW, YOU ARE
JUST SO PEACEFUL...

29:56.961 --> 29:58.530
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.298
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT SAVED ME?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.068
THIS BOOK.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.173
- UM...
- HERE, YOU CAN HAVE IT.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.910
THAT BOOK GOT ME
THROUGH PRISON.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.944
WHICH IS A TALL ORDER
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME

30:12.978 --> 30:14.480
WHO WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.516
A LOT OF JUDGMENT,
KIND OF REALLY DOES
A NUMBER ON YOUR HEAD.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.152
( chuckles )

30:22.253 --> 30:24.990
MY MOM SAID YOU
WEREN'T FEELING WELL.

30:25.023 --> 30:27.393
YOU SEEMED A LITTLE WEIRD
ALL NIGHT.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.528
UM...

30:29.561 --> 30:33.464
I ATE A LITTLE BIT
OF A POT COOKIE.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.233
IT WAS MEDICINAL.

30:35.267 --> 30:39.171
BUT APPARENTLY,
POT CAN BE PRETTY POTENT.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.307
( laughs )
THAT RHYMES.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.942
WAIT, DOES IT?

30:43.976 --> 30:46.211
YOU CAN'T GO HOME
LIKE THIS.

30:46.244 --> 30:49.114
NO, I JUST...
I JUST NEED TO LIE DOWN

30:49.147 --> 30:52.351
FOR LIKE ONE SECOND.
JUST A QUICK LITTLE...

30:56.955 --> 30:58.390
COME WITH ME.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.561
( sighs )
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

31:03.596 --> 31:05.431
MY PLACE.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.482
( groans )
I REMEMBER THIS PLACE.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.959
OH MY GOD.
YOUR COUCH IS SO COMFORTABLE.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.128
( sighs )

31:37.162 --> 31:38.230
( groans )

31:38.263 --> 31:41.333
YOUR MOM'S FUNNY.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.001
AND NICE.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.104
I USED TO FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT HER.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.038
YOU'RE SO NICE TOO.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.208
TAKING ME TO THE HOSPITAL
THE OTHER DAY

31:49.240 --> 31:51.576
AND NOW YOU'RE
HELPING ME TONIGHT.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.212
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.949
I KNOW I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
BEEN SO NICE TO YOU.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.385
IT'S OKAY, APRIL.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.922
I STILL THINK ABOUT THAT.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.458
I STILL FEEL BAD.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.294
A LOT.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.237
I FORGIVE YOU.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.273
( mutters )

33:07.118 --> 33:09.121
( cellphone chimes )

33:12.156 --> 33:14.026
Hey, it's Leo.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.426
So much for promising
to answer.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.195
Just kidding.
( chuckles )

33:17.229 --> 33:19.263
It's late and,
uh, I just wanted
to let you know

33:19.298 --> 33:21.066
I'm going to New York
for a couple weeks.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.067
You know, to get
my head together,

33:23.102 --> 33:26.003
hopefully.
I'm taking the train
tomorrow morning.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.507
So I'll call you
when I get there. Bye.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.415
( gasps )

33:44.690 --> 33:46.692
( breathing heavily )

33:50.395 --> 33:52.397
( knocks )

33:54.500 --> 33:56.667
NATALIE, HI.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.369
THE GIRLS AREN'T
HERE RIGHT NOW.

33:58.403 --> 34:01.105
THAT'S OKAY.
I CAME TO TALK TO YOU.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.508
OH.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.643
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:04.675 --> 34:06.211
YES AND NO.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.514
I DON'T LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE
THINK I'M STUPID.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.284
WHAT?

34:12.317 --> 34:13.719
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU THINK
I'M SOME KIND OF IDIOT

34:13.751 --> 34:15.788
AND DON'T WANT ME
HANGING AROUND YOUR DAUGHTERS.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.456
WHICH IS FUNNY,
CONSIDERING YOU'RE THE ONE

34:18.489 --> 34:20.425
WHO BROUGHT ME HERE
TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.228
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT
MY BONE MARROW,

34:23.262 --> 34:24.695
NOT MY BRAIN.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.666
OKAY.
( sighs )

34:27.699 --> 34:30.135
I THINK YOU'RE
A VERY NICE GIRL.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.838
BUT DIFFERENT FAMILIES
HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS

34:33.070 --> 34:34.773
FOR THEIR KIDS AND...

34:34.806 --> 34:39.210
LIKE MY MOM'S ARE LOW
AND YOURS ARE HIGH?

34:39.244 --> 34:42.780
- I SAW HOW YOU TREATED HER,
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF HER.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

34:42.815 --> 34:46.251
WELL, IT PROBABLY IS WHAT
YOU MEANT, JUST NOT WHAT
YOU MEANT TO SAY.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.855
LOOK...

34:50.088 --> 34:52.458
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

34:52.490 --> 34:55.159
BUT I DECIDED TO STAY
IN BOSTON TO GET TO KNOW

34:55.193 --> 34:57.728
MY HALF SISTERS AND LEARN
MORE ABOUT MY DAD.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.865
SORRY IF THAT'S NOT
AMBITIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOU.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.135
BUT IT'S SORT OF THE CARDS
THAT I'VE BEEN DEALT.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.740
WAIT, NATALIE.
NATALIE!

35:09.775 --> 35:11.376
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA.

35:11.409 --> 35:15.146
AND MAYBE UNINTENTIONALLY
I HAVE TAKEN OUT

35:15.179 --> 35:17.782
SOME OF MY FRUSTRATION
WITH YOUR MOM ON YOU.

35:17.815 --> 35:20.652
AND IF I HAVE,
I'M SORRY, REALLY.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.789
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE ADMITTING IT.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.456
BUT, SARA,

35:25.490 --> 35:27.159
I'M NOT MY MOM.

35:27.192 --> 35:30.228
AND BY THE WAY,
BRENNA'S NOT YOU.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.481
ARE YOU OKAY?

35:49.514 --> 35:51.349
AM I OKAY?

35:51.382 --> 35:52.684
HOW ARE YOU?

35:52.717 --> 35:54.920
WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BE
THINKING ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW?

35:55.152 --> 35:59.791
APRIL, THERE WAS
A TRAIN CRASH.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.860
THE 10:00 A.M. TO NEW YORK,
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

36:04.762 --> 36:05.831
LEO.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.865
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO REACH HIM.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.168
WAS THAT DEFINITELY
THE ONE HE WAS ON?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.336
YEAH, HE CAME BY
TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME

36:12.371 --> 36:14.907
- ON THE WAY TO THE STATION.
- ( line rings )

36:14.940 --> 36:17.476
Leo:
It's Leo, leave a message.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.378
UH...

36:19.411 --> 36:20.646
I HAVE TO GO.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.219
Leo:
It's Leo, leave a message.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.820
( groans )

36:29.855 --> 36:30.856
Leo:
It's Leo.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.693
MOM, GRANDMA, BRENNA!

36:37.461 --> 36:39.463
( gasps )

36:47.672 --> 36:49.608
I WAS SO MESSED UP
AFTER SEEING MEG

36:49.641 --> 36:52.376
THAT I JUST STARTED WALKING

36:52.411 --> 36:54.579
AND I...

36:54.612 --> 36:56.547
I GUESS JUST LOST
THE TRACK OF TIME.

36:56.581 --> 36:58.382
THAT'S WHY
YOU MISSED THE TRAIN?

36:58.416 --> 36:59.550
AND MY PHONE WAS
OUT OF POWER

36:59.585 --> 37:01.920
AND THEN I HEARD
ABOUT THE CRASH

37:01.954 --> 37:03.521
AND I HAD TO SEE YOU.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.389
WE ALL THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.592
I SHOULD BE.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.460
AGAIN.

37:09.494 --> 37:10.929
WAIT, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

37:10.963 --> 37:13.398
- NEVER MIND, IT'S--
- NO, TALK TO ME!

37:13.431 --> 37:15.467
ARE YOU REALLY SAYING
YOU WISH YOU WERE DEAD?

37:15.500 --> 37:20.771
WHY DO I KEEP SURVIVING
WHEN REALLY GOOD PEOPLE
HAVE TO DIE?

37:20.806 --> 37:23.608
PEOPLE WITH HOPES
AND DREAMS.

37:23.641 --> 37:25.643
JACKSON WAS GONNA
BE ON BROADWAY

37:25.677 --> 37:29.481
AND MEG HAS
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY,

37:29.514 --> 37:32.451
AND NOW SHE MIGHT
NOT MAKE IT.

37:32.483 --> 37:35.586
THEY KNEW HOW THEY WANTED
TO LEAVE THEIR MARKS
ON THE WORLD

37:35.621 --> 37:37.588
AND THEY DON'T
GET TO DO IT.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.358
BUT I'M STILL HERE?

37:39.391 --> 37:42.527
YOU CAN'T THINK
LIKE THAT.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.831
I JUST-- I FEEL--

37:46.864 --> 37:48.666
I JUST FEEL SO--

37:48.699 --> 37:50.369
GUILTY.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.007
I READ SOMETHING
INTERESTING

37:56.041 --> 37:57.775
IN A BUDDHIST BOOK
THIS MORNING.

37:57.809 --> 38:01.512
AND IT BASICALLY SAID
THAT...

38:01.545 --> 38:05.916
EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.054
WHAT IF THAT'S TRUE?
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF...

38:09.286 --> 38:12.824
YOU MISSING THE TRAIN
AND ME FINDING YOU HERE--

38:12.858 --> 38:15.960
YOU KNOW, US BOTH
STILL LIVING...

38:18.530 --> 38:21.065
MAYBE IT'S NOT ABOUT
FINDING THE REASON

38:21.298 --> 38:22.701
THAT ALL THIS IS
HAPPENING.

38:22.733 --> 38:26.471
MAYBE IT'S JUST ABOUT
TRUSTING THAT THERE IS ONE.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.311
THANK YOU.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.748
THANK YOU FOR OPENING
UP TO ME.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.786
I WANTED TO, I JUST...

38:43.487 --> 38:45.456
I DIDN'T WANNA
PUSH YOU AWAY.

38:50.061 --> 38:53.030
THIS IS JUST DIFFERENT...

38:54.465 --> 38:56.967
FOR ME.
I'VE NEVER...

38:59.871 --> 39:01.907
FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.351
( doorbell rings )

39:16.454 --> 39:19.023
I'M SO SORRY,
I'M SO LATE.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.429
SO UNTIL, YOU KNOW,
I FIND A REPLACEMENT

39:24.463 --> 39:26.030
I HAVE TO DO
BOTH ASSISTANT JOBS.

39:26.063 --> 39:28.400
WHICH MEANS I HAVE
TO ORGANIZE THE SHIPPING

39:28.432 --> 39:31.536
FOR THE NEW FALL LINE
AND THEN I HAVE TO BUY AN OUTFIT

39:31.570 --> 39:34.639
FOR JACQUELINE'S DOG
TO MATCH IT.

39:34.672 --> 39:38.076
SO, UM, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

39:38.110 --> 39:39.978
I MEAN, IT LOOKS AMAZING.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.114
- THIS ISN'T WORKING.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:42.146 --> 39:44.682
THIS RELATIONSHIP,
WITH YOUR JOB.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.119
IT'S-- I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO HAPPEN THIS WAY, BUT--

39:47.152 --> 39:49.987
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH ME?

39:50.021 --> 39:52.123
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
WORKING A LOT LATELY?

39:53.157 --> 39:55.393
RIGHT RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
I AM SO SORRY.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.728
WAS IT EASIER FOR YOU
WHEN I WAS JUST AVAILABLE--

39:57.762 --> 39:59.965
HOLD ON, I'M NOT
BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.032
OH, BUT YOU--

40:02.067 --> 40:03.702
WELL, YOU JUST SAID
ABOUT MY JOB...

40:03.735 --> 40:05.603
YOUR JOB IS CRAZY.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.539
AND I DON'T SEE
YOU ENOUGH.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.440
AND THAT'S WHY
I THINK

40:09.474 --> 40:11.876
WE SHOULD JUST
MOVE IN TOGETHER.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.414
THAT WAY I CAN
TAKE THE LATE-NIGHT
AND EARLY-MORNING SHIFTS.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.150
UM...

40:23.188 --> 40:25.724
BETH KINGSTON,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.592
WILL YOU MOVE IN WITH ME?

40:35.967 --> 40:37.034
( chuckles )

40:37.068 --> 40:38.436
A BRIBE?

40:38.469 --> 40:41.206
REALLY, MOM?

40:41.438 --> 40:43.141
A PEACE OFFERING.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.077
I'M SORRY.

40:46.110 --> 40:50.748
I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE TENSE WITH US.

40:50.782 --> 40:55.987
MOSTLY BECAUSE OF ME
AND MY ASSUMPTIONS
AND EXPECTATIONS.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.688
RIGHT?
I MEAN, YOU CAN SAY IT.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.657
KINDA, YEAH.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.193
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

41:02.226 --> 41:06.498
I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU
IN YOUR CHOICES.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.867
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

41:11.036 --> 41:14.172
OKAY, BECAUSE I WAS
SITTING DOWN TO MAKE
MY COLLEGE LIST.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.806
OH, YEAH?

41:15.840 --> 41:20.545
YEAH, AND I SAW SOMETHING
THAT GOT ME KIND OF EXCITED.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.949
YOU KNOW, I'VE SAVED UP
SOME MONEY WORKING
AT THE GALLERY

41:23.981 --> 41:27.085
AND I PLAN TO SAVE
A WHOLE BUNCH MORE
OVER THE NEXT YEAR.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.119
RIGHT.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.521
- AND?
- AND...

41:29.554 --> 41:30.621
AND...

41:32.556 --> 41:34.559
I WANNA TAKE A YEAR OFF
TO TRAVEL.
