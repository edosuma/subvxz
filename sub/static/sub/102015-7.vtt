WEBVTT

00:14.348 --> 00:15.724
Get up, Emily.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.142
No.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.812
-Okay. Get up, Emily.
-Don't make me go.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.397
Today is gonna to be good for you.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.192
But I hate my life and I truly wanna die.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.904
And that's exactly why we need a spa day.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.536
Everyone, remember to pack towels
otherwise they'll charge us.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.412
This is ridiculous.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.791
Now, you're gonna spend even more money
on some experimental voodoo

00:40.874 --> 00:43.043
after we wasted a fortune
on that silly opera.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.838
Emily is sick.
She could barely get out of bed.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.007
What if she has the measles?
Or worse, spiritual measles?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.050
What the hell is that?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.969
I don't know, but I don't wanna find out.

00:52.052 --> 00:56.390
Don't worry.
Emily will feel whole again after today.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.100
You see? Aunt Lavinia swears by this.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.602
-I mean, if we're talking about chakras--
-We're not.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.897
She will come back better than before.
More aligned than a newly built railroad.

01:04.982 --> 01:08.485
Don't you dare try to put this
in terms that I can understand.

01:09.945 --> 01:10.946
Sue.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.739
Are you coming with us?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.117
Well, I've been reading
a book on etiquette.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.493
Sounds like a real page-turner.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.996
And it says if your mother-in-law
invites you to the water cure,

01:19.079 --> 01:20.622
you must accept the invitation.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.791
-That's right, you must.
-Well, thank God.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.209
I am desperate to talk to you.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.461
-Can we please find time to be alone?
-Of course.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.379
Okay.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.549
But, Emily, I am hoping
today will be relaxing.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.177
A chance to unwind and de-stress.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.637
I have not seen you since the opera
and we need to talk.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.265
Does everyone have everything they need?

01:38.348 --> 01:42.352
Tinctures? Essential oils?
A fresh perspective?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.563
-I only packed my bad attitude.
-Emily.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.857
Bugger. Bastard. Bitch!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.358
-What?
-What is it?

01:48.442 --> 01:51.111
-What's wrong? What's the matter?
-I can't find my most powerful crystal.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.780
-Where was the last place you saw it?
-On my shrine.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.032
What does it look like?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.909
Obviously, it's an obsidian.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.911
I'm trying to protect myself
from bad energy.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.787
I feel tired. God.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.789
Dad, keep that bad energy away from me.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.917
Oh, it's fine, I have an extra.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.627
All right, everyone. Let's get going.

02:08.836 --> 02:09.838
Goodbye.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.760
-You know that we can't afford this.
-Edward, your daughter is sick.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.012
There's only one place
we can hope for her to get well.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.555
No price too high for wellness.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.064
Are we sure this is mud?

02:44.039 --> 02:46.792
Hydrotherapy, or the water cure,

02:47.251 --> 02:51.171
can best be described as
the practice of treating ailments

02:51.255 --> 02:54.675
by soaking different parts
of your body in water.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.178
Sue! Sue!

02:59.012 --> 03:01.390
Emily. Pay attention to your Aunt Lavinia.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.435
She's traveled all over the world
and brought back mystical secrets.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.770
Yes, I have, girls.

03:07.563 --> 03:11.608
You're about to engage in something that
was used in all the ancient civilizations.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.319
Egypt, Greece, Rome.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.823
I mean, people call it "alternative,"

03:17.906 --> 03:21.660
but I'm open to any alternative
as long as it works.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.328
I agree.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.874
I mean, sure, doctors may not approve,
but what do doctors really know?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.041
Very little.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.086
Mark my words,
at the end of your time in the water cure,

03:31.170 --> 03:34.339
you won't be the same sick,
disease-ridden,

03:34.423 --> 03:36.550
melancholy women you are right now.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.968
What if that's my brand?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.761
Emily, enough.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.556
We're here for you, remember?
You're the one with the problems.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.727
No, sister, we all have problems.
The issues are in the tissues.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.152
Oh, dear God. It's hot in here.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.322
But we can't leave yet. This is expensive.

03:58.405 --> 04:02.284
Oh, give in to the heat.
Give in to the flow.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.703
Let the water cure you.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.331
Do not let your energetic boundaries leak.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.499
What happens if they do?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.502
My sweet Vinnie.

04:11.585 --> 04:16.714
Energetic leaks can lead to anything
from unhealthy relationships

04:16.798 --> 04:20.385
to the urge to eat food that tastes good.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.014
Oh, good.

04:28.894 --> 04:29.895
Sue.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.648
What?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.608
Let's sneak out of here and go talk.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.735
I thought we were going to relax.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.445
Let's relax while we talk.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.616
For some reason, I don't think
you're going to let me do that.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.993
-Come on.
-Remember, water is medicine.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.703
And truth protects.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.958
Well, I'm definitely feeling
a lot better. So...

04:51.041 --> 04:54.127
Where do you think you're going?
We paid for 17 more minutes in here.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.631
Oh, well, I thought it might be nice
for us to try the body healer?

04:58.674 --> 05:02.344
I've heard great things about her.
She's very moon oriented.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.054
Exactly. Big fan of that.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.141
Well, I spent a lot of time planning out
a very strict schedule here, but sure.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.269
You go do your thing, I suppose.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.354
Cool, we'll meet you at the plunge pool.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.233
Such bad energy.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.985
Next session!

05:18.944 --> 05:20.946
So, the point is, I ruined everything.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.323
I should have never written
that letter to his wife.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.869
And I shouldn't have tried to
sit in his box at the opera.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.372
Now Sam is never gonna publish my poem.
He's done with me.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.417
Emily, of course he's going to publish it.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.170
He's going to publish
everything you write.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.504
He's been telling everyone.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.007
I know he has, but I messed up.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.927
Now he hates me.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.638
I don't believe that.
You're seeing things wrong.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.683
Sam is going to publish you for sure.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.518
Sue, it's been weeks.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.397
I mean, every day I check the paper
and nothing. No poem.

05:56.315 --> 06:00.068
If he really thinks I'm this exciting
new voice, then what is he waiting for?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.237
The answer is he's not.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.493
After he left me at the opera,
he probably threw my poem in the trash.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.786
Flip.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.294
Emily, this anxiety you're experiencing,
it's natural.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.172
This is a big step for you
and your career.

06:20.589 --> 06:25.802
You're putting yourself out there
and it's stirring up a lot of emotion.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.721
But that's good.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.432
I mean, you of all people,
you know what to do with emotion.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.893
Put it on the page, write about it.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.186
Turn it into art.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.064
But I don't believe in myself anymore.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.150
Wait, what?

06:40.234 --> 06:44.988
I used to have this confidence.
This power. But not anymore.

06:45.072 --> 06:49.076
Not since I met him and, Sue,
I hate to say this, but it's your fault.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.495
My fault?

06:51.578 --> 06:54.206
Yes, because you pressured me into this.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.499
You introduced me to him,

06:55.582 --> 06:58.252
you started filling my head
with all these ideas about fame.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.004
And as soon as I gave him my poem,
I lost everything.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.966
The flow I used to have, it got cut off.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.552
I used to be inspired by everything.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.055
And then, suddenly, the only thing
that mattered to me was him.

07:10.514 --> 07:14.309
What he thought, how he felt.
It's like he invaded me.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.311
He's all I can think about.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.605
I used to have a drive
that came from somewhere else

07:18.689 --> 07:19.982
and now it all comes from him.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.692
-Whoa.
-What?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.862
There's a lot going on over there.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.196
What do you mean? Where?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.198
It's like your brain is on fire.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.158
That tracks.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.458
Can you please say something?
Because I feel like I'm losing my mind.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.752
Emily, relax.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.921
All you need to do is do nothing.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.591
Breathe, exhale.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.556
I promise you, it's all going to be okay.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.059
Sam is going to publish your poem.
You just need to trust him.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.313
Next!

08:38.894 --> 08:39.895
Okay.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.691
Next session!

08:47.236 --> 08:51.406
Now with divine love and incessant
hydration, we can heal ourselves.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.537
-What is happening to her?
-She's having a paroxysm.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.999
Oh, it can be a very,
very cleansing experience.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.960
If we're lucky,
we all just might have one.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.047
We just need to clench our lower anatomy.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.050
Now breathe out everything
that's troubling you.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.010
Get centered, get centered, girls.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.304
Live in the moment, not in the past.

09:14.388 --> 09:19.685
Not in the future.
Forever, after all, is about right now.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.359
<i>Forever - is composed of nows -</i>

09:37.452 --> 09:39.454
What's going on? You seem upset.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.874
I'm fine.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.669
"Fine" is not a very Emily word.
You would never say, "I'm fine."

09:45.752 --> 09:49.965
You would say, "I lost a world
the other day," or something like that.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.218
Tell me what's going on.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.970
Nothing. Nothing is going on.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.098
No, nothing other than
a man ruining my life.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.517
-Shut up.
-Yeah, it sucks.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.145
I thought you were above stuff like that.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.439
What made you think that?

10:06.440 --> 10:10.861
Come on. Emily, you've always
been completely independent.

10:11.528 --> 10:15.949
You turned down marriage proposals
and, I mean, that's so brave.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.411
You know, sometimes I wish I had said yes
to those marriage proposals.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.915
Maybe if I was married with a baby,
life would be simpler.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.836
That is the craziest shit
I've ever heard you say.

10:29.713 --> 10:35.052
We need this water cure to heal you
because your aura is negative right now,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.803
and I need you to be positive.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.014
I need you to be strong.

10:39.890 --> 10:40.891
Emily?

10:41.433 --> 10:42.518
Yes?

10:43.727 --> 10:44.937
You're my hero.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.198
Must be hard on your own.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.492
You get used to it.

10:59.618 --> 11:05.040
So, you want help writing your will
now that your husband has...

11:06.083 --> 11:08.335
Yeah, I want everything to go to Billy.

11:09.503 --> 11:14.508
Well, that solves the question
of beneficiary.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.096
And who do you want
to be the executor of your will?

11:19.179 --> 11:23.141
It should be someone that you trust
to carry out your wishes once you...

11:23.934 --> 11:25.686
you know, expire.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.815
I trust you.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.028
It's funny,
the stuff I worried about last year.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.490
I know. We were kids then.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.076
Now we're in our mid-twenties.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.369
Writing my will.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.371
Heavy shit.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.582
Adulting is hard.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.714
And should anything happen to you,
God forbid,

11:53.797 --> 11:56.800
before little William comes of age...

11:59.386 --> 12:02.431
I know you haven't gotten
a lot of what you wanted,

12:03.682 --> 12:09.354
but... I always had this feeling
that you would be such a good father.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.650
And I'd want you to look after him.

12:16.820 --> 12:21.033
Jane, I would be honored.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.873
Well, all right.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.960
Why don't you take a look at this?

12:32.461 --> 12:35.088
Let me know if you want
to add anything before I draft it.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.260
Do you want to hold him?

12:41.053 --> 12:42.054
Really?

12:45.724 --> 12:47.017
Hey, Billy.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.606
Hey.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.777
Wanna see what's outside?

13:02.199 --> 13:03.951
You see your mama's horses?

13:04.535 --> 13:06.119
You know what sound a horsey makes?

13:08.163 --> 13:09.331
Yeah.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.504
Everything looks good to me.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.048
Great.

13:18.131 --> 13:24.596
Well, I will fill in the details
and get this notarized

13:25.389 --> 13:27.391
and then we will be all squared away.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.476
-There you go.
-Come here, Billy.

13:31.979 --> 13:32.980
There you go.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.740
-There you go.
-Goodbye, Billy.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.744
I'll walk you out.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.670
Austin?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.174
We made our decisions.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.011
And I think they were the right ones.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.307
Yes, of course.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.728
Thank you for bringing me
back to my senses.

14:14.605 --> 14:15.689
I didn't mean to...

14:15.772 --> 14:18.233
-You were seeing me out.
-Right, right.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.283
Dad!

14:28.202 --> 14:29.703
What are you two doing here?

14:30.204 --> 14:32.748
Mama had to deliver a dress
to the Dickinsons.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.708
Can we stay with Daddy?

14:34.791 --> 14:36.668
No, we have to go home now.

14:37.503 --> 14:38.795
Will you be home for dinner?

14:42.090 --> 14:45.761
Hey, why don't you go pick me
the most beautiful wildflowers?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.262
For your mama. Go, go, go.

14:49.765 --> 14:53.685
So, should I keep cooking
for just two then? Or...

14:53.769 --> 14:55.604
We have a new edition coming out.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.982
Our subscriber numbers are up.
We're getting down to the wire.

14:59.066 --> 15:03.487
This is getting too big, Henry.
You get death threats every day.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.697
I like to call them
polite letters from the South.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.491
We are beyond joking about this.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.328
You are putting
our daughter's life in danger.

15:13.330 --> 15:19.169
Her life already is in danger and
it will only be more so if we don't fight.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.506
Trust me.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.475
Emily Dickinson?

15:34.476 --> 15:35.727
George?

15:35.811 --> 15:37.688
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

15:37.771 --> 15:38.981
I'm getting a shvitz in.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.817
I learned that during my travels
across the country.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.653
You truly meet every kind of person
on the road.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.906
Man, am I delighted to see you.

15:48.740 --> 15:49.867
How have you been?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.702
Yeah, yeah, I've been...

15:51.785 --> 15:54.746
Sorry.
What are you doing on the East Coast?

15:55.372 --> 15:59.042
Well, my journey out west
didn't exactly go according to plan.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.961
So, you didn't strike gold?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.297
-I never got to California.
-Oh, no.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.550
Look, the Oregon Trail is not easy, okay?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.595
Every time we got to a river,
we had to caulk the wagon and float it.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.055
Our pace was grueling,
rations were meager,

16:12.139 --> 16:15.392
and if you hunted too much
in a certain area, game became scarce.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.728
-Sounds rough.
-Yeah.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.772
But weirdly, it was fun.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.525
And what about your wife?

16:23.609 --> 16:24.610
Oh, Ellen?

16:25.068 --> 16:28.238
Yes. Ellen Mandeville Grout
of the Princeton Grouts.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.533
Unfortunately, she got dysentery.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.913
That's... That is awful.
Did she die or is she--

16:35.996 --> 16:37.623
-No, no, no. No, no.
-Oh, okay.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.834
She's fine, but it was pretty gross.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.879
Dysentery is kind of a lot.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.422
We needed some space.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.592
Anyway, enough about me.
Catch me up on everything.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.261
I wanna hear all the adventures
of Emily Dickinson.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.930
There's really not much to tell.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.433
Come on. How's your writing?
God, I miss reading it.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.604
"<i>Water, is taught by thirst.
Land -- by Oceans passed</i>."

17:00.687 --> 17:02.272
Wow, you still remember that one.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.942
Of course. This place reminded me of it.

17:05.025 --> 17:09.695
I'm always getting reminded of your poems.
Those lines, they stick with me.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.906
You know, I'm actually getting published.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.285
What? That's amazing.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.913
Well, I'm supposed be getting published.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.123
The editor has had my poem for ages now

17:20.207 --> 17:23.627
and he says he's going to do it
but hasn't actually done it yet.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.296
Well, he sounds crazy.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.799
If it was me and I had your poem?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.468
It would be on the front page
the next day.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.681
So are you back for good?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.683
I'm not sure.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.726
I'm trying not to make plans, you know?

17:39.810 --> 17:42.938
Gotta go where the road takes you.
Life is a journey, right?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.189
Sure.

17:44.273 --> 17:48.819
But I would love to come visit you
and Austin while I'm around.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.989
Maybe then you can show me
some of your new poems.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.241
I miss being your audience.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.785
That would be nice.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.247
Or maybe I'll just see them in the paper.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.041
Right. Yes.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.921
Cool. Well, I gotta go soak my feet
in some freezing water.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.091
This place has really helped me
awaken my truth.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.969
Hey, George.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.221
Yeah?

18:18.348 --> 18:21.351
Listen, I know we ended things badly.

18:21.894 --> 18:26.982
And maybe I never said this properly,
but thank you for believing in me.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.485
I always will.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.615
Emily!

18:36.408 --> 18:39.119
There you are. You missed the rubdown.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.204
Mom, your skin.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.289
I know. I'm very raw.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.666
Where is everyone else?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.251
They're all lying on hot coals.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.462
I didn't quite feel up to that,

18:48.545 --> 18:51.757
so I thought maybe you and I could
do something a little more calming.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.925
Like what?

18:53.008 --> 18:56.386
There's a treatment
called the "cocoon rebirth."

18:57.054 --> 18:58.472
I do like cocoons.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.973
Oh, God.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
It's so cold.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.734
Why are the sheets so cold?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.819
I'm having a great time.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.613
It's like you're back in my womb.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.032
You remember when
you were nestled tightly in my womb?

19:17.115 --> 19:18.617
Not well, Mom.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.285
I'm in a cocoon.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.871
I'm nestled in here
and I won't be the same when I come out.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.289
I won't be the same anymore.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.874
-Everything will be different.
-Mom?

19:30.754 --> 19:31.964
Are you warm?

19:32.047 --> 19:35.175
I don't understand. These sheets were
freezing a second ago. Why am I so hot?

19:35.259 --> 19:36.426
I feel it too.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.971
Get me out.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.139
-What?
-Get me out!

19:41.223 --> 19:43.600
Mom, I can't get you out. We have to
wait till they come and unwrap us.

19:43.684 --> 19:44.768
No, no, I need out.

19:44.852 --> 19:45.936
Someone unwrap us!

19:46.019 --> 19:47.563
-Get us out, please!
-Mom, it's okay.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.189
-Everything is going to be okay.
-Oh, my God, Emily.

19:49.273 --> 19:50.691
-Emily, I forgot how to breathe.
-Mom.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.067
-Emily, teach me how to breathe.
-Okay.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.735
Well-- Help. Somebody, hello!

19:53.819 --> 19:56.154
-Hello!
-Help us. We are going to die.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.490
Oh, God. Okay.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.410
-What are you doing?
-I can't get out.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.413
Got it.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.965
I hate this place.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.062
Aunt Lavinia.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.823
Emily? What's wrong?

20:42.034 --> 20:43.869
I think I've fallen in love.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.663
In love?

20:48.207 --> 20:50.834
I've been completely overtaken by someone.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.379
Infected, just diseased by him!

20:54.963 --> 20:58.175
I don't know what else it could be, Mom.
I think I've fallen in love.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.471
Who is this person?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.515
Who is this person?

21:04.598 --> 21:06.391
Doesn't matter, you wouldn't approve.

21:06.934 --> 21:07.935
Well...

21:08.810 --> 21:10.812
whoever this person is...

21:11.730 --> 21:14.566
he shouldn't be making you feel like this.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.069
Someone who loves you,

21:18.195 --> 21:21.990
someone worthy of you,
shouldn't make you feel sick.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.910
That's not what love is.

21:26.453 --> 21:32.042
Look, I know my marriage to your father
isn't perfect, not by any stretch.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.921
But even when he makes
me so angry that I could,

21:36.004 --> 21:38.590
I don't know, undust his study,

21:38.674 --> 21:40.843
I know he wants what's best for me.

21:41.510 --> 21:44.638
I know he'd sit by my bedside
if I needed him.

21:45.514 --> 21:47.057
Taking care of me.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.560
Can you say that about this person?

21:52.354 --> 21:55.440
Okay, look. I know I've always been
very hard on you about marriage,

21:56.233 --> 21:59.486
but you don't deserve to feel unwell.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.906
I didn't carry you
into this world for that.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.616
I didn't.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.288
Mom?

22:12.499 --> 22:17.379
Nothing about this place has made me
feel better except for what you just said.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.425
I feel almost healed for now.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.429
Well, I suppose for now
is the best that we can do.

22:31.018 --> 22:33.353
Time for last treatment!

22:33.979 --> 22:36.481
-It's time for our last treatment.
-Do we have to?

22:36.565 --> 22:38.192
Well, we already paid for it.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.986
Who knows? This one could be fun.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.758
I have to say, I...

23:05.344 --> 23:06.553
I feel better.

23:08.472 --> 23:09.681
I do too.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.227
Maybe you'll be able to write tonight.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.314
Maybe I will.

23:18.732 --> 23:19.942
I'm rooting for you.

23:23.654 --> 23:24.821
See you around, neighbor.

23:34.164 --> 23:37.376
<i>Forever - is composed of nows -</i>

23:37.793 --> 23:39.503
<i>'Tis not a different time -</i>

23:39.586 --> 23:41.797
<i>Except for Infiniteness -</i>

23:41.880 --> 23:44.091
<i>And Latitude of Home -</i>

23:45.801 --> 23:47.553
I'm telling you, Dickinson,
we're onto something.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.054
I certainly hope so.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.600
Emily. You have a glow of health.

23:53.684 --> 23:55.143
What are you doing here?

23:55.227 --> 23:58.313
Just convincing your father
to hop on board the Sam Bowles Express.

23:58.397 --> 24:00.107
Sure. I'm going to invest in his paper.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.234
Not just a paper, my friend. An empire.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.486
I hope it does better
than my last investment.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.905
This is print journalism.
There's no way it can fail.

24:07.531 --> 24:08.949
Let's have a drink in my office.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.826
-I'll be right there.
-Excellent.

24:10.909 --> 24:11.910
Emily.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.746
I'm happy to see you.

24:15.289 --> 24:16.290
Are you?

24:16.373 --> 24:19.334
Yes. You're looking really well.

24:19.877 --> 24:23.964
I was finally able to
stop worrying about the poem.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.966
What do you mean?

24:26.049 --> 24:27.134
My poem.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.637
You're obviously not going to publish it
and I've made peace with it.

24:31.722 --> 24:33.348
Well, I have some news for you.

24:34.057 --> 24:34.933
What?

24:35.017 --> 24:38.145
Your poem,
it's on the front page of the paper.

24:38.812 --> 24:39.813
Tomorrow.

24:42.608 --> 24:44.276
Emily, did you hear what I said?

24:44.776 --> 24:45.777
You--

24:48.363 --> 24:49.656
You're publishing it?

24:49.740 --> 24:52.034
Yes. Of course I am.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.288
I was just waiting for the right moment.
And it's finally arrived.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.582
It's now. You just had to trust me.

25:05.756 --> 25:06.757
Wait here.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.011
I'll just be a second.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.837
I wanna give you all my poems.

25:46.755 --> 25:49.132
-All of them?
-Yes, all of them.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.511
Every one I ever wrote.

25:55.764 --> 25:56.765
Take them.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.143
They're yours.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.281
Wow.
