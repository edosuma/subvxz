00:16.487 --> 00:18.557
I need to spend more time in the gym.

00:18.687 --> 00:20.484
If I'd known there were so many hills...

00:20.607 --> 00:22.757
I would have picked
a different city to explore.

00:22.887 --> 00:26.402
It was worth every step, sir.
The architecture alone.

00:26.687 --> 00:29.121
I could have spent all day in that temple.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.243
With your permission, Captain...

00:34.527 --> 00:36.961
I'd like to write the report to Starfleet.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.761
It was my first visit
to a pre-warp culture.

00:41.127 --> 00:42.446
Seems only fitting.

00:42.567 --> 00:46.640
I don't suppose it has anything to do
with the tactical situation down there.

00:47.607 --> 00:48.926
Am I that obvious?

00:50.687 --> 00:52.564
I can't think of a better man for the job.

00:54.407 --> 00:55.556
Welcome home.

00:56.407 --> 00:58.443
Any unexpected guests?

00:59.247 --> 01:01.522
Not a single parasite, spore, or virus.

01:01.647 --> 01:04.366
- I take it the expedition was productive?
- Very.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.200
You're done here.

01:11.287 --> 01:15.360
You know, as interesting as that was,
it's always good to get home.

01:16.487 --> 01:18.796
The speaker at the political rally...

01:19.207 --> 01:21.846
What was his name?
Chancellor Kultrey?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.320
Kultarey.

01:24.287 --> 01:26.562
You could write a book about him alone.

01:26.847 --> 01:30.317
His speech reminded me of
Winston Churchill before World War II.

01:34.047 --> 01:36.402
Is something wrong, Malcolm?

01:38.167 --> 01:40.317
- My communicator.
- What about it?

01:43.847 --> 01:44.962
It's gone.

01:52.087 --> 01:54.647
It's been a long road

01:56.487 --> 01:58.876
Gettin' from there to here

01:59.447 --> 02:02.245
It's been a long time

02:03.047 --> 02:06.517
But my time is finally near

02:07.007 --> 02:10.396
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:11.247 --> 02:14.080
I will touch the sky

02:14.487 --> 02:18.116
And they're not gonna
hold me down no more

02:18.247 --> 02:21.239
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:21.367 --> 02:25.645
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:25.807 --> 02:28.879
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:29.007 --> 02:33.159
I've got faith to believe

02:33.287 --> 02:36.245
I can do anything

02:36.367 --> 02:40.076
I've got strength of the soul

02:40.687 --> 02:43.679
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:43.807 --> 02:48.005
I can reach any star

02:49.167 --> 02:51.158
I've got faith

02:53.007 --> 02:56.124
I've got faith

02:56.687 --> 02:59.963
Faith of the heart

03:39.407 --> 03:40.760
It's not in Decon.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.445
- Any luck?
- None yet.

03:43.927 --> 03:47.078
Did the launch bay crew find it
while they were securing the pod?

03:47.207 --> 03:49.004
I've already spoken to them.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.961
I did everything
but tear up the floor plating.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.727
When was the last time
you remember having it?

03:55.127 --> 03:57.800
I contacted T'Pol
to let her know we'd entered the city.

03:57.927 --> 03:58.996
After that?

03:59.367 --> 04:02.325
Did you have any reason
to take it out of your pocket?

04:02.687 --> 04:04.359
- No.
- Are you sure?

04:06.207 --> 04:07.560
I'd remember.

04:08.047 --> 04:11.198
Either I dropped it,
or someone picked my pocket.

04:12.687 --> 04:15.360
We covered a lot of ground.
It could be anywhere.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.762
I think I can narrow down
the search, Captain.

04:17.887 --> 04:20.879
An inverse carrier wave
should amplify its power signature.

04:21.007 --> 04:22.963
With any luck, I'll be able to isolate it.

04:24.247 --> 04:25.919
I'm getting something.

04:26.207 --> 04:28.596
I've got it down to 2 square kilometres.

04:29.247 --> 04:31.920
- Can you do a little better?
- I'll try.

04:32.407 --> 04:35.080
Didn't you say something
about a war brewing down there?

04:35.207 --> 04:36.845
We saw a lot of propaganda.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.039
But from what we could tell,
nobody's started fighting yet.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.237
It's crucial we retrieve the technology.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.404
We can't risk contaminating
a pre-warp culture.

04:46.007 --> 04:49.317
I've isolated the signal
to within three city blocks.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.878
That's the best I can do, sir.

04:53.007 --> 04:55.999
This "L" shaped structure,
isn't that the fountain?

04:56.447 --> 04:58.085
The one with the statues?

04:58.567 --> 05:01.923
The tavern was
directly across the street. Here.

05:02.567 --> 05:06.003
The communicator could've slipped
out of my pocket when we sat down.

05:06.127 --> 05:07.845
It's a good place to start.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.282
You've got the Bridge.

05:09.407 --> 05:12.763
Tell Dr Phlox we're going to need
his cosmetic services again.

05:12.887 --> 05:14.878
You could use
another set of eyes down there.

05:15.007 --> 05:18.158
I appreciate the offer, Trip,
but the fewer set of eyes, the better.

05:18.287 --> 05:20.642
- I'm a regular bloodhound.
- Next time.

05:32.887 --> 05:36.243
We'll be in range of their surveillance
towers in less than two minutes.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.756
The hull plating's
already been polarised.

05:39.847 --> 05:41.883
Your feet ready for another hike?

05:42.247 --> 05:44.283
It's not a problem, sir.

05:46.487 --> 05:47.840
Captain...

05:48.647 --> 05:51.207
my carelessness was inexcusable.

05:52.247 --> 05:55.523
I'm prepared for whatever reprimand
you feel is appropriate.

05:55.807 --> 05:59.083
How about 30 years in the Brig?
Or maybe a good flogging?

05:59.207 --> 06:00.196
Sir?

06:00.327 --> 06:03.797
It was an accident, Malcolm.
It could have happened to any of us.

06:06.327 --> 06:09.239
Three military aircraft,
72 km off starboard.

06:09.807 --> 06:12.082
I suggest you increase
our descent vector.

06:12.207 --> 06:15.165
That should keep us
well below their visual threshold.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.479
This was the table?

07:02.247 --> 07:03.521
Positive.

07:04.087 --> 07:05.406
Try your scanner.

07:15.767 --> 07:16.995
Welcome back.

07:17.847 --> 07:19.121
What would you like?

07:19.247 --> 07:21.681
- Can you give us a few minutes?
- Of course.

07:22.887 --> 07:25.196
Where's your friend?
The young woman.

07:26.127 --> 07:27.685
You have a good memory.

07:28.207 --> 07:30.118
She was difficult to forget.

07:31.127 --> 07:33.243
I'll pass along the compliment.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.486
Do you live here?

07:36.327 --> 07:37.726
No. Just visiting.

07:38.607 --> 07:41.997
We received a shipment of Allakas malt
this afternoon.

07:44.247 --> 07:45.362
Sounds good.

07:58.807 --> 08:00.604
- I've got it.
- Where?

08:02.367 --> 08:05.803
It's in a room, off that corridor.

08:11.207 --> 08:13.675
- Were you in there?
- No.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.758
There are two people inside.

08:51.527 --> 08:53.438
Better wait till they come out.

09:39.447 --> 09:41.199
Does this belong to you?

09:42.247 --> 09:43.566
What is it?

09:44.687 --> 09:45.802
I don't know.

10:13.927 --> 10:15.804
What kind of weapon is this?

10:24.087 --> 10:26.760
- Where is General Gosis?
- On the eastern perimeter.

10:27.487 --> 10:31.002
Send a Level 4 communiquÃ©
and tell him I think we've found...

10:31.207 --> 10:32.879
a pair of enemy spies.

10:36.287 --> 10:39.279
Take them to the Complex
and put your men on alert.

10:44.047 --> 10:47.642
You won't be seeing your friends
at the Alliance for a long time.

11:10.327 --> 11:13.125
I'm telling you, something's gone wrong.
We should hail them.

11:13.247 --> 11:16.398
If they're in a public place,
the communicator would draw attention.

11:16.527 --> 11:18.358
We'll have to take that risk.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.760
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.245
The com-line's open.

11:30.727 --> 11:32.524
Captain, please respond.

11:40.127 --> 11:41.480
Close the channel.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.723
Did you get a fix on the signal?

11:51.327 --> 11:53.045
Somewhere in this district.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.207
That's more than 30 km from the tavern.

11:56.527 --> 11:58.119
Where's the shuttlepod?

12:00.007 --> 12:01.281
It hasn't moved.

12:02.127 --> 12:05.358
They couldn't have travelled that far
on foot. Not that fast.

12:05.487 --> 12:07.603
Maybe they took a train or a car.

12:08.087 --> 12:10.681
If there was a change of plan,
they would have told us.

12:10.807 --> 12:14.482
Try to isolate their bio-signs.
I want to know exactly where they are.

12:14.607 --> 12:17.724
There are nearly 100,000 people
in that part of the city.

12:18.407 --> 12:20.875
We'd have more luck
if we moved into a lower orbit.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.963
Any closer and we'd be detected.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.076
Do your best.

12:53.767 --> 12:57.043
- Still bothering you?
- Didn't have time to visit the Doctor.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.164
I wonder if the guard would bring us
some Epsom salts...

13:06.007 --> 13:07.440
if I asked politely.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.485
I wouldn't count on it.

13:12.127 --> 13:14.766
We came down
to retrieve my communicator.

13:15.287 --> 13:17.005
Now we've lost two of them.

13:17.407 --> 13:20.638
Not to mention
my phase-pistol and a pair of scanners.

13:22.647 --> 13:25.115
I just hope
they don't find the shuttlepod.

13:29.487 --> 13:32.604
If they really think we are spying
for this Alliance...

13:33.607 --> 13:36.360
perhaps we should consider
telling them the truth.

13:38.207 --> 13:40.516
I'm not sure anyone would believe us.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.037
Well, it couldn't hurt to try.

13:44.727 --> 13:46.524
Visitors from another world?

13:48.487 --> 13:50.762
There's no way to know
how they'd react.

13:56.207 --> 13:58.596
- The less we say, the better.
- Understood.

14:01.447 --> 14:02.482
Follow me.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.003
Which of you is the Captain?

14:39.767 --> 14:43.316
Something unexpected happened
when I was examining this transmitter.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.517
It began to make a sound,
so I opened it.

14:45.647 --> 14:48.764
Someone calling herself T'Pol
seemed very concerned...

14:48.887 --> 14:50.843
about her captain's well-being.

14:52.567 --> 14:55.320
Which one of you
was she trying to contact?

14:56.727 --> 14:58.126
I'm the Captain.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.483
The Alliance must be
growing desperate...

15:01.607 --> 15:04.565
if they're recruiting
military officers as spies.

15:07.327 --> 15:09.363
We're not part of the military.

15:10.807 --> 15:13.685
I suppose you're the Captain
of a pleasure boat.

15:19.167 --> 15:22.364
This transceiver,
what's its frequency, its range?

15:23.767 --> 15:24.916
I don't know.

15:28.047 --> 15:30.003
This appears to be
a computing instrument.

15:30.127 --> 15:31.799
Tell me, how does it work?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.678
My superiors expect answers.

15:45.847 --> 15:48.645
As an officer,
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

15:48.767 --> 15:52.396
I have no desire to harm you,
but I need you to cooperate.

15:53.767 --> 15:57.237
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.521
I trust you enjoyed the rally
this morning.

16:04.807 --> 16:07.002
That's why you're here, isn't it?

16:07.327 --> 16:08.476
It's curious.

16:08.807 --> 16:13.403
The two of you visiting this city
the same day as Chancellor Kultarey.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.358
Did you come here
to observe his security arrangement?

16:18.847 --> 16:20.803
Or perhaps assassinate him?

16:21.207 --> 16:24.438
We're aware of your ancestral claims
against our city.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.883
It must make a tempting target.

16:30.207 --> 16:31.686
We're visitors...

16:32.687 --> 16:34.040
not spies.

16:34.967 --> 16:38.198
This T'Pol who tried to contact you,
where is she?

17:21.367 --> 17:23.243
You've been surgically altered.

17:25.807 --> 17:26.876
General.

17:30.447 --> 17:31.675
His blood.

17:32.687 --> 17:33.915
It's red.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.566
Take them to Temec.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.761
Have him perform a full examination.

17:54.327 --> 17:56.716
They're here, inside this compound.

17:57.807 --> 18:00.082
Guard towers, gun emplacements.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.166
It's not a hotel.

18:02.287 --> 18:05.279
We could take Shuttlepod Two,
set it down here.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.762
They're being held
less than 30 metres away.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.685
We'd be back in orbit
before anyone knew they were gone.

18:10.807 --> 18:14.322
If you were captured, you'd be giving
the inhabitants more technology.

18:14.447 --> 18:17.644
It would undoubtedly affect
the evolution of their society.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.678
What if they didn't see us coming?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.923
We've still got that Suliban Cell Ship...

18:22.047 --> 18:24.607
the one we used
to rescue Klaang from the Helix.

18:24.727 --> 18:26.763
I've been working on it in my free time.

18:26.887 --> 18:29.481
I'm pretty close to figuring out
how it works.

18:29.607 --> 18:32.758
If I can bring the cloak online,
we can get past their defences...

18:32.887 --> 18:35.401
grab our people,
and no one will see a thing.

18:36.727 --> 18:38.080
Work quickly.

18:38.847 --> 18:40.758
- I could use a hand.
- Aye, sir.

18:41.047 --> 18:43.925
I suggest we monitor the communiquÃ©s
coming from the compound.

18:44.047 --> 18:46.800
They may tell us what's happening
to the Captain and Mr Reed.

18:46.927 --> 18:48.201
Right away.

18:54.087 --> 18:55.281
I don't get it.

18:55.727 --> 18:57.558
The power converter's engaged.

18:57.687 --> 19:00.406
Juice is definitely flowing
through these relays.

19:02.287 --> 19:04.323
So why can we still see the ship?

19:05.607 --> 19:08.041
Maybe this panel
isn't the cloaking device.

19:08.687 --> 19:11.918
I've identified every other component.
It's got to be it.

19:13.447 --> 19:15.358
Run the power-up sequence again.

19:17.047 --> 19:20.483
This would be a lot easier
if there was a button marked "cloak."

19:22.847 --> 19:24.439
Hold on a minute, Travis.

19:35.647 --> 19:36.966
Are you all right?

19:38.607 --> 19:41.041
Just got the wind
knocked out of me a bit.

19:50.567 --> 19:52.683
Maybe a little more than that.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.766
Is there any pain?

20:07.447 --> 20:09.165
It tingles a little.

20:09.287 --> 20:11.847
Can you move your fingers?

20:13.567 --> 20:16.161
- How's that?
- You tell me.

20:17.247 --> 20:18.680
They feel all right.

20:19.287 --> 20:22.359
- What does your scanner say?
- Very little, I'm afraid.

20:23.607 --> 20:25.996
Quantum physics
is hardly my specialty...

20:26.127 --> 20:28.800
but I'd guess
that you received an intense dose...

20:28.927 --> 20:32.522
of whatever particle radiation
that ship uses to conceal itself.

20:32.647 --> 20:35.081
Are you saying
I'm permanently cloaked?

20:35.207 --> 20:37.118
It's difficult to determine...

20:37.247 --> 20:41.035
but I suspect your appendage
will eventually rematerialise on its own.

20:41.287 --> 20:42.606
Eventually?

20:42.767 --> 20:45.201
Come back in an hour.
I'll check on your progress.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.797
What am I supposed to do
in the meantime? I can't work like this.

21:00.647 --> 21:03.036
I'd also recommend a fresh uniform.

21:04.607 --> 21:05.756
Thanks.

21:15.647 --> 21:17.160
Shall we try this?

21:27.327 --> 21:30.046
It's some kind of coherent energy pulse.

21:30.487 --> 21:33.240
I thought this technology
was only theoretical.

21:33.527 --> 21:36.997
Our Alliance friends
seem to have turned theory into reality.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.275
May I?

21:44.527 --> 21:46.597
There appears to be another setting.

21:57.007 --> 22:00.363
If the Alliance has equipped its troops
with these weapons...

22:03.607 --> 22:06.360
Make sure the devices
are kept under guard at all times.

22:06.487 --> 22:08.205
Use men you can trust.

22:12.967 --> 22:15.879
- What did you find?
- See for yourself.

22:21.127 --> 22:24.483
- How is this possible?
- There's only one explanation.

22:25.367 --> 22:29.201
Our prisoners
belong to another species.

22:33.647 --> 22:37.242
Dr Temec tells me your deformities
are not the work of a surgeon.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.199
He found no obvious incisions
or scar tissue.

22:41.887 --> 22:44.355
You're even more abnormal
on the inside.

22:44.847 --> 22:46.963
Redundant renal organ.

22:47.527 --> 22:50.087
And you're missing
four thoracic vertebrae.

22:51.607 --> 22:54.565
Temec can't even begin to explain
this mass.

22:55.487 --> 22:56.966
As for your red blood...

22:57.087 --> 23:00.762
the Doctor tells me your haemoglobin
is based on iron, a toxic element.

23:00.887 --> 23:03.879
He conducted the test four times
to be certain.

23:06.247 --> 23:09.000
He has a theory
about where you came from.

23:10.007 --> 23:13.283
I found it difficult to believe
until I saw this.

23:15.767 --> 23:19.442
One of our surveillance aircraft
took this image early this morning.

23:19.567 --> 23:23.242
The pilot said the object was travelling
at very high speed.

23:24.047 --> 23:25.605
Can you explain?

23:28.407 --> 23:32.195
None of the other planets in our system
are capable of supporting life.

23:33.967 --> 23:35.639
Where do you come from?

23:37.807 --> 23:40.844
Our scientists tell me it's unlikely
that a craft of this size...

23:40.967 --> 23:43.276
could have travelled
from another star system.

23:43.407 --> 23:47.116
They suspect a larger ship
must be somewhere nearby.

23:48.007 --> 23:50.316
Perhaps orbiting our planet.

23:53.247 --> 23:54.919
Tell me your orders!

23:55.727 --> 23:58.002
Have you made contact
with the Alliance?

24:00.847 --> 24:02.075
Answer me.

24:08.087 --> 24:13.002
Our intelligence reports
underestimate you, General.

24:16.887 --> 24:18.400
Alien creatures?

24:20.527 --> 24:23.246
You're even more delusional
than we thought.

24:24.007 --> 24:25.884
This isn't a spaceship.

24:26.407 --> 24:30.286
It's suborbital.
A highly experimental aircraft.

24:31.087 --> 24:33.681
We've been observing your territory
for months.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.361
How did you evade
our surveillance towers?

24:37.287 --> 24:40.518
It's made from a composite alloy.

24:42.327 --> 24:43.726
Invisible...

24:44.327 --> 24:47.558
to any of your tracking systems.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.882
And your biological anomalies?

24:53.127 --> 24:56.199
We've been genetically enhanced.

24:57.407 --> 24:59.079
What kind of enhancements?

25:01.047 --> 25:04.756
Our immune systems are resistant
to chemical and biological weapons...

25:05.047 --> 25:07.515
and our internal organs
have been modified...

25:07.647 --> 25:10.241
to increase cellular regeneration
by 30%.

25:11.007 --> 25:13.521
That way,
our wounds can heal more quickly.

25:14.887 --> 25:16.878
Create the perfect soldier.

25:17.647 --> 25:19.285
How many of you are there?

25:20.767 --> 25:23.759
We're prototypes, the only ones.

25:24.687 --> 25:27.485
And your devices,
are they prototypes as well?

25:28.047 --> 25:29.162
All of them.

25:31.287 --> 25:32.640
Take them back.

25:44.407 --> 25:45.840
Do you believe them?

25:47.727 --> 25:49.797
It's a plausible explanation.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.998
The Alliance could have thousands
of soldiers with these mutations.

25:55.127 --> 25:57.357
We need to verify what they've told us.

25:57.527 --> 26:00.439
I ran every imaginable test.

26:04.687 --> 26:07.281
If I were to extract the organs...

26:08.767 --> 26:10.883
I could study them in more detail.

26:14.327 --> 26:16.716
You'll be in charge of the execution.

26:17.647 --> 26:19.558
I'll inform the prisoners.

26:28.967 --> 26:31.481
Subcommander, another communiquÃ©.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.366
It's from a General Gosis
to the Chancellor.

26:39.567 --> 26:42.161
He said they've captured
two enemy spies.

26:47.727 --> 26:49.319
They're gonna hang them.

26:52.727 --> 26:56.242
Reconnect the diffraction relays
and we'll give it another shot.

27:01.807 --> 27:02.956
Any change?

27:04.367 --> 27:06.244
Still missing in action.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.404
Having a cloaked hand
could have its advantages.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.723
Be useful in a poker match.

27:12.647 --> 27:15.559
I could probably become
a world-class magician.

27:15.687 --> 27:18.759
It might be helpful on movie night,
if you bring a date.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.316
In case you want to steal some popcorn.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.246
Let's try it again.

27:33.807 --> 27:34.876
Go ahead.

27:41.527 --> 27:42.926
Is it working?

27:43.207 --> 27:45.084
Not exactly. Shut her down.

27:49.607 --> 27:53.759
The cloaking generator's running
at 110%, and it's still not enough.

27:55.487 --> 27:57.682
Let's route more power
from the warp relays.

27:57.807 --> 27:59.525
Maybe that'll do the trick.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.166
How soon can you launch?

28:07.287 --> 28:09.562
We're still reconfiguring
the power matrix...

28:09.687 --> 28:12.076
- but I'm pretty confident...
- You don't have time.

28:12.207 --> 28:15.165
They're going to be executed
in less than two hours.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.240
We'll get it working on our way down,
if we have to.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.880
Look, invisible or not...

28:23.007 --> 28:25.919
this Cell Ship can take more
of a beating than our shuttlepod.

28:26.047 --> 28:27.958
You're about to find out.

28:28.687 --> 28:30.200
Prepare it for launch.

28:35.127 --> 28:38.403
An upset stomach?
Do you really think he'd fall for that?

28:39.127 --> 28:41.516
It may be an old trick
where we come from...

28:41.647 --> 28:43.444
but maybe they haven't heard of it here.

28:43.567 --> 28:47.401
Even if we got out of the compound,
we'd never make it to the shuttle.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.564
Not looking like this.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.285
Genetic enhancements.

28:57.007 --> 29:00.079
- Very creative, Malcolm.
- Thanks.

29:00.727 --> 29:03.116
Improvisation isn't my strong suit.

29:03.247 --> 29:05.317
You made us sound like the Suliban.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.556
What do you suppose
Enterprise will do?

29:15.767 --> 29:16.961
After we're...

29:23.567 --> 29:25.239
If I know T'Pol...

29:28.567 --> 29:32.242
she won't want to leave
any contamination behind.

29:33.127 --> 29:36.164
It may take some time,
but she'll find a way...

29:37.927 --> 29:39.519
to get everything back.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.965
Including our...

29:46.807 --> 29:48.001
remains.

29:50.967 --> 29:52.400
It's ironic.

29:54.647 --> 29:56.239
Giving our lives...

29:57.327 --> 30:00.046
to protect people who want to kill us.

30:01.687 --> 30:03.359
It's a big planet, Malcolm.

30:04.127 --> 30:06.163
I'm sure they're not all like that.

30:07.767 --> 30:09.439
I'm not afraid, sir.

30:20.007 --> 30:22.441
What if we did tell them the truth?

30:22.967 --> 30:26.562
You said it yourself, Captain.
They'd never believe us.

30:27.807 --> 30:30.082
If we show them to the shuttlepod...

30:31.047 --> 30:33.242
bring the General up to Enterprise...

30:34.127 --> 30:36.004
give him the grand tour...

30:36.567 --> 30:39.604
top it off with dinner
in the Captain's Mess...

30:39.767 --> 30:41.917
We'd probably all have a good laugh...

30:42.047 --> 30:44.561
over how he almost sent us
to the gallows.

30:46.847 --> 30:50.317
I've gotten plenty of lectures
on cultural contamination.

30:51.287 --> 30:56.156
But T'Pol never mentioned anything
about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it.

31:00.847 --> 31:02.997
If we did tell them who we are...

31:04.127 --> 31:06.322
maybe it would do them
a world of good.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.517
Look what the Vulcans did for Earth.

31:08.647 --> 31:10.046
That was different.

31:11.047 --> 31:13.720
These people
haven't even split the atom yet.

31:15.127 --> 31:17.880
The Vulcans waited
until we were ready...

31:18.127 --> 31:21.278
until we had the ability
to travel to other stars.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.001
We're doing the right thing, Malcolm.

31:35.967 --> 31:38.925
I'm sorry you won't get a chance
to write that report.

31:40.087 --> 31:41.998
It could still happen, sir.

31:43.247 --> 31:47.001
I'm expecting a rescue party
to come barging through that door.

31:48.767 --> 31:50.041
Any moment.

32:09.607 --> 32:12.804
We'll be in range of
their surveillance towers in two minutes.

32:12.927 --> 32:14.360
They'll never see us coming.

32:21.847 --> 32:22.996
On your feet.

32:50.407 --> 32:51.726
What was that?

32:52.247 --> 32:55.080
There's a power drain
in the cloaking generator.

33:02.327 --> 33:04.522
Are the warp relays off-line?

33:04.647 --> 33:06.239
Primary and backups.

33:07.127 --> 33:08.401
The weapon nodes are active.

33:08.527 --> 33:11.166
I thought we diverted power
from all the secondary systems.

33:11.287 --> 33:12.276
We did.

33:13.327 --> 33:16.842
They may have been programmed
to reactivate when we launched.

33:16.967 --> 33:20.846
Three military aircraft off our portside.
They're on an intercept course.

33:46.527 --> 33:48.882
Travis, can't you hold this thing steady?

33:49.007 --> 33:51.840
Lt'd be a lot easier
if they stopped firing at us.

33:53.087 --> 33:55.123
- Commander.
- Stand by.

34:13.167 --> 34:14.918
He's my tactical officer.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.637
He can tell you
everything you want to know...

34:17.766 --> 34:21.077
about the Alliance's troop deployments,
their weapons.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.646
Captain.

34:25.726 --> 34:27.717
You don't need to kill him.

35:29.607 --> 35:31.165
Your ride's here.

35:33.447 --> 35:36.484
Sir, the phase-pistol, our equipment.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.439
Don't leave without me.

36:49.167 --> 36:50.122
Let's go!

37:15.967 --> 37:18.197
The shuttlepod's
right where you left it, sir.

37:18.327 --> 37:20.204
We'll be there in two minutes.

37:25.687 --> 37:26.836
Captain?

37:26.967 --> 37:28.878
Sir, looking for this?

37:46.127 --> 37:47.321
Come in.

37:49.327 --> 37:50.726
I scanned the region ahead.

37:50.847 --> 37:53.884
There's a blue giant cluster
three light-years from our position.

37:54.007 --> 37:56.521
- Any planets?
- None that are inhabited.

37:58.807 --> 38:00.843
Sounds like a nice change of pace.

38:01.407 --> 38:03.523
- Have Travis set a course.
- Yes, sir.

38:05.647 --> 38:07.285
Was there something else?

38:10.487 --> 38:13.206
You took a risk
coming down in that Cell Ship.

38:14.287 --> 38:16.047
The cloaking device could have failed.

38:16.047 --> 38:16.399
The cloaking device could have failed.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.165
A calculated risk.

38:22.007 --> 38:23.440
I'm glad you did it.

38:26.607 --> 38:29.679
What's important
is that we got everything back:

38:29.927 --> 38:32.760
The communicator, the phase-pistol,
the shuttlepod.

38:33.167 --> 38:37.160
We could have done a lot of damage to
those people if we'd left any of it behind.

38:37.287 --> 38:39.323
We did do damage to those people.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.837
We've changed their perception
of the Alliance.

38:46.087 --> 38:48.885
They now believe their enemy
is capable of creating...

38:49.007 --> 38:52.522
genetically-enhanced soldiers,
not to mention particle weapons.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.283
And thanks to that Suliban ship...

38:55.407 --> 38:59.525
they also think the Alliance
has developed invisible aircraft.

39:00.927 --> 39:04.761
You don't have to leave technology
behind to contaminate a culture.

39:16.207 --> 39:19.756
You were willing to sacrifice your life
to protect them.

39:22.567 --> 39:24.478
I would not have expected that.

39:37.447 --> 39:40.883
- You're making excellent progress.
- Yeah? What about this?

39:41.007 --> 39:43.726
- That's nothing.
- Maybe nothing to you.

39:44.047 --> 39:46.242
Give it time.

39:49.727 --> 39:51.001
Thanks, Doc.
