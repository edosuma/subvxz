00:28.284 --> 00:32.375
<i>I left Israel in 1980,
after three years in the army.</i>

00:32.455 --> 00:35.844
<i>I was desperate to escape the well-worn path.</i>

00:35.924 --> 00:40.583
<i>You know, high school, university,
work, marriage, kids...</i>

00:40.663 --> 00:45.471
<i>...not me. I wanted to be different,
to experience the extraordinary...</i>

00:45.551 --> 00:49.478
<i>...and to enter the unknown,
discover lost tribes...</i>

00:49.558 --> 00:53.429
<i>...the hidden treasures,
the darkest heart of the jungle...</i>

00:53.509 --> 00:56.732
<i>...which, of course,
is why I ended up in Bolivia...</i>

00:56.812 --> 00:58.663
<i>...South America.</i>

01:24.773 --> 01:27.896
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, may God be with you.

01:27.976 --> 01:29.543
Cheers.

01:58.741 --> 02:02.418
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, please!

02:02.498 --> 02:06.156
- Wait, wait! Hey!
- Sir?

02:07.250 --> 02:09.293
Wait, wait!

02:15.758 --> 02:17.803
Thank you so much, sir.

02:21.363 --> 02:24.393
- Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.
- Can I take that?

02:24.473 --> 02:27.044
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Okay.

02:28.704 --> 02:32.401
Thank you. Thank you so much,
everyone. Thank you so much.

02:32.481 --> 02:34.997
- I'm sorry about the bag.
- Oh, no problem.

02:35.077 --> 02:38.157
- Okay, good. I'm Marcus Stamm.
- Yossi Ghinsberg.

02:38.237 --> 02:40.790
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.426
Yeah.

02:59.201 --> 03:02.291
<i>You couldn't help but fall in love
with Marcus Stamm.</i>

03:02.371 --> 03:04.728
<i>This Swiss school teacher on a sabbatical...</i>

03:04.808 --> 03:08.296
<i>...had the heart of a poet
and the soul of a saint.</i>

03:08.376 --> 03:10.488
<i>I'd never met anyone like him before.</i>

03:14.883 --> 03:17.206
This is not bad!

03:17.286 --> 03:22.712
I told my parents I'd be back in a year
but I don't think I'm ever going back.

03:25.894 --> 03:27.783
Well, lucky you.

03:27.863 --> 03:30.707
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:31.234 --> 03:33.127
She likes you.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.812
No. It can't be.

03:43.892 --> 03:46.435
Kevin? Hey!

03:46.515 --> 03:48.170
Hey, Kevin!

03:48.250 --> 03:51.280
Oh, my God! Hey! My God! Come here!

03:51.360 --> 03:54.443
What are you doing here?
Marcus! How are you, man?

03:54.523 --> 03:56.279
Hey, I thought you went home after Patagonia!

03:56.359 --> 04:00.326
No, I decided to trek up
the Cordilleras to get some more shots.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.546
- Hey, this is my friend, Yossi Ghinsberg.
- Hey, man. Kevin Gale.

04:03.626 --> 04:06.582
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you, too.

04:06.662 --> 04:08.713
Come here, man!

04:09.538 --> 04:12.541
- <i>I had already heard about Kevin Gale.</i>
- He taught me that...

04:12.621 --> 04:14.987
<i>He was a legend amongst
the backpacking community...</i>

04:15.067 --> 04:18.634
<i>...because he had hiked all over South
America, taking incredible photographs.</i>

04:18.714 --> 04:21.764
- But, you know, that's why we're here...
- <i>I also knew...</i>

04:21.844 --> 04:24.563
<i>...he was Marcus's closest friend.</i>

04:24.643 --> 04:27.603
I've only been in South America
for a few months.

04:27.683 --> 04:30.996
- Really? Where were you before that?
- The glamorous world...

04:31.076 --> 04:34.683
- ...of fishing trawlers in Alaska.
- Yeah, that sounds great.

04:34.763 --> 04:37.706
Freezing my ass off in New York,
unloading trucks.

04:37.786 --> 04:39.976
- Really?
- But then went to Vegas...

04:40.056 --> 04:43.577
- ...to make my fortune.
- What happened?

04:43.657 --> 04:47.002
- I lost everything.
- Yeah.

04:47.082 --> 04:51.380
Well, you found this guy,
and that is... priceless.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.057
Okay.

04:53.849 --> 04:56.004
Where'd you just come back in from?

04:56.084 --> 04:59.942
Well, I went up to this place called Colca.
It's in southern Peru.

05:00.022 --> 05:02.212
I was taking shots of condors.

05:02.292 --> 05:04.168
It's amazing.

05:24.212 --> 05:27.534
- That's gross! Yeah.
- Bottoms up.

05:34.455 --> 05:36.472
What is this stuff?

05:36.552 --> 05:38.504
It's called San Pedro.

05:38.584 --> 05:43.452
And how long does San Pedro
normally take to...

05:43.832 --> 05:46.643
- ...kick in?
- You'll know.

05:54.076 --> 05:55.953
Nothing's happening.

05:56.311 --> 05:58.989
Just wait. Trust me.

06:06.154 --> 06:08.432
I actually feel kind of light-headed.

06:23.505 --> 06:25.382
I think it's starting.

06:30.378 --> 06:32.256
<i>I'm flying.</i>

07:06.449 --> 07:09.192
"With the long, lonely night ahead...

07:09.384 --> 07:13.397
...and all the time in the world to decide
on the actions of a future life...

07:15.223 --> 07:17.301
...he closed his eyes."

07:18.527 --> 07:20.537
"It takes time to live."

07:22.464 --> 07:24.404
"It takes time to live."

07:25.801 --> 07:27.684
That's great.

07:28.604 --> 07:31.060
I think I should send this book to my father.

07:32.507 --> 07:34.518
Doesn't he like you on the road?

07:36.411 --> 07:39.676
It's not that he doesn't like it.
He just can't understand it.

07:40.849 --> 07:42.971
And so he thinks...

07:43.051 --> 07:45.142
...I'm throwing my life away.

07:49.692 --> 07:51.936
I read a book once that said...

07:53.495 --> 07:56.140
"The last human freedom...

07:57.399 --> 07:59.609
...is to choose one's own way."

08:02.537 --> 08:04.381
Yeah, that would be nice.

08:39.241 --> 08:41.429
Sorry about him. He's American.

08:55.624 --> 08:57.580
- This? Here?
- On the right, here.

08:57.660 --> 09:00.905
- We're definitely gonna fit in, right?
- It'll be fine.

09:08.904 --> 09:10.480
<i>Hola.</i>

09:28.055 --> 09:29.933
<i>Good morning.</i>

09:30.843 --> 09:32.702
Are you American?

09:37.650 --> 09:39.193
No.

09:40.602 --> 09:43.380
There's nothing like the jungle at night.

09:43.638 --> 09:46.995
It's the most alive sound. Insects, birds.

09:47.075 --> 09:49.364
All these animals around you.

09:49.444 --> 09:53.657
It's like they're screaming at you,
pulsing like electricity.

09:55.818 --> 09:58.741
And then suddenly... it stops.

09:59.788 --> 10:01.231
There is nothing.

10:02.390 --> 10:05.965
Just you and whatever you came looking for.

10:07.129 --> 10:10.574
Between the mining and the missionaries,
there'll be nothing left.

10:11.266 --> 10:14.760
In one generation, all of the Indians gone.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.514
The last of the hidden world, gone.

10:17.773 --> 10:19.316
Gone!

10:19.775 --> 10:24.421
That's what you're dreaming of.
Right? The hidden world?

10:25.313 --> 10:27.464
That's why you're here.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.010
Yossi, I'm not trying to be an asshole.
I'm just saying.

10:35.090 --> 10:37.804
Do you want to be like every other tourist?
You want to go to Machu Picchu?

10:37.884 --> 10:41.049
Anybody can go to Machu Picchu.
But the jungle?

10:41.129 --> 10:45.747
To see wild Indians that nobody has ever
seen before and this guy, Karl, who I met...

10:45.827 --> 10:49.439
- ...who's very nice, he can take us there!
- How do you know he is telling the truth?

10:49.519 --> 10:51.364
He pans for gold.
He's friends with the Indians.

10:51.444 --> 10:53.869
He could be making all of this up,
like a spiel for him.

10:53.949 --> 10:56.231
They know each other,
they're friends, they hang out.

10:56.311 --> 10:58.455
Smiling with the Indians.
You met him in the street!

10:58.535 --> 11:00.829
He showed me photos.
You can take photos of this.

11:00.909 --> 11:03.605
Him standing there, with the Indians, right?

11:03.685 --> 11:06.309
He says the rivers there are filled with
gold and we come back with pockets full.

11:06.389 --> 11:08.643
How can you even trust...
please watch that, it's burning, okay?

11:08.723 --> 11:10.729
Yes. No, that is good.

11:10.809 --> 11:14.069
- Magical. Thank you.
- There you go!

11:16.231 --> 11:19.187
- It's nonsense, Yossi.
- Please... meet him!

11:19.267 --> 11:23.028
- You just... you seem very sold on the idea.
- I'm doing it! I'm gonna do it.

11:23.108 --> 11:25.828
You'll see I'm right.
Cancel your flights home.

11:25.908 --> 11:28.530
- And come with me.
- Cancel our flight home?

11:28.610 --> 11:32.027
That's great.
You're being stupid, Yossi, okay?

11:32.107 --> 11:33.405
Kevin, tell him he's crazy.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.639
I think Marcus is right.
It sounds like bullshit.

11:36.719 --> 11:38.562
Just meet him.

11:45.660 --> 11:49.351
This map's useless. It's what, one to 500?

11:49.431 --> 11:51.086
It's a joke.

11:51.166 --> 11:54.356
It's this and it's here. I'm your navigation.

11:54.436 --> 11:57.025
The Toromonas Indians are here.

11:57.105 --> 12:00.903
"Río Colorado" Chico. We fly to Apolo, here.

12:00.983 --> 12:04.389
We hike to Asariamas.

12:04.469 --> 12:08.536
Then from here to Río Colorado, Chico...

12:08.616 --> 12:12.309
- ...three, four days.
- I've never heard of these Toromonas.

12:12.687 --> 12:14.330
Exactly.

12:15.123 --> 12:17.866
- You're a photographer, right?
- Yeah.

12:17.946 --> 12:22.806
There, you take photos, they get you
straight into National Geographic.

12:24.449 --> 12:26.543
So, what do you say?

12:29.327 --> 12:32.861
50 bucks a head to guide us.
That's it. To help and buy provisions.

12:32.941 --> 12:35.297
And he says he'll pay us back
when we pan some gold.

12:35.377 --> 12:38.180
Yeah. The gold. Yeah. Whatever happened
to talking him out of it? Like we...

12:38.260 --> 12:41.375
No, I know, I know. Look,
I have my doubts as well, but...

12:41.455 --> 12:43.108
...Karl seems to know
what he's talking about.

12:43.188 --> 12:46.518
And he's right. I'd get some amazing shots.
Like, once-in-a-lifetime shots.

12:46.598 --> 12:49.257
Kevin wants to go. Marcus, come on.
You have to come with us.

12:49.337 --> 12:51.434
It'll be an adventure.

12:55.830 --> 12:58.520
- Yeah, okay, fine. I'll come.
- Yeah!

12:58.600 --> 13:00.155
Yes!

13:02.135 --> 13:05.561
We are going to have
the best time! This is "Yes"!

13:06.291 --> 13:08.192
Who's going to the jungle?

13:09.344 --> 13:12.300
- Come on. Is that enough?
- We'll get more food in Asariamas.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.942
- Don't worry. No one starves in the jungle.
- What are these?

13:16.218 --> 13:19.047
Speed. Zippo.
It makes you feel like Superman.

13:19.127 --> 13:21.099
- Right.
- We need a better map.

13:21.179 --> 13:23.325
I told you, there's no better map.

13:23.405 --> 13:25.520
It's all unchartered. Look, nothing.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.976
We just follow the river. In the jungle,
the rivers are your best friends. Okay?

13:31.056 --> 13:32.892
You pay for this?

13:35.453 --> 13:38.263
- We pay for this.
- Of course.

13:45.530 --> 13:47.706
Right, no watches...

13:47.786 --> 13:49.843
...and no wallets.

13:50.802 --> 13:53.325
Karl says... "There's no time in ze jungle."

13:53.405 --> 13:55.160
- No.
- "Can't get lost in ze jungle.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.895
- Can't starve in ze jungle."
- "Invincible, ja?"

13:57.975 --> 14:00.586
- "It's gonna be easy."
- Ja!

14:03.148 --> 14:05.391
I'm gonna miss all this stuff.

14:06.318 --> 14:07.839
What's that?

14:07.919 --> 14:11.164
This my uncle gave to me before I left.

14:11.689 --> 14:13.567
He said it will protect me.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.281
You believe that?

14:16.361 --> 14:18.196
- Kevin.
- What?

14:18.276 --> 14:20.373
I... I don't know.

14:20.965 --> 14:24.589
I don't know,
but he carried it all his life...

14:24.669 --> 14:28.147
...and he survived the war and the camps.

14:30.525 --> 14:34.554
And then two days after
he gave it to me, he died.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.643
Yeah, I think we have room for it.

15:29.101 --> 15:31.745
This is the last frontier on Earth.

15:32.537 --> 15:35.815
Still alive, still wild.

15:36.208 --> 15:39.459
Not for long. We don't like wild.

15:39.811 --> 15:44.002
We don't like untamed.
We're obsessed with control.

15:44.082 --> 15:45.670
So...

15:45.750 --> 15:47.772
...we ruin the whole planet...

15:47.852 --> 15:51.343
...and pride ourselves for creating
stupid national parks...

15:51.423 --> 15:55.200
...with stupid rangers in stupid hats...

15:55.793 --> 15:57.815
...to protect what's already gone.

15:58.695 --> 16:02.921
Why? 'Cause we're scared.
The jungle shows us what we really are.

16:03.001 --> 16:05.644
We're nothing. We're a joke.

16:06.471 --> 16:08.347
God fucked up.

16:14.979 --> 16:16.823
These tribal cultures...

16:17.365 --> 16:20.777
...it seems like they live
in Stone Age but in reality...

16:21.619 --> 16:23.601
...they are far ahead of us.

16:24.256 --> 16:27.133
Invisible. Hidden in the Madidi.

16:27.892 --> 16:31.916
The Toromonas, they understand
that they are part...

16:31.996 --> 16:34.240
...of a much bigger picture.

16:34.399 --> 16:37.886
They don't want what we have. They're smart.

16:38.570 --> 16:40.647
They're truly free.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.737
Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Shit.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.085
- What is it?
- Something hit me!

17:07.165 --> 17:09.992
- What? What?
- I don't know! Like a bat or something.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.271
Something hit me in the face,
like a bat or something.

17:12.351 --> 17:17.016
- I thought I was being attacked.
- Yes, you were. By a killer moth.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.826
This place is getting pretty dangerous, man.
I think we should turn back.

17:21.906 --> 17:26.261
- Boys, go to bed.
- You're okay, though? You're alright?

17:26.340 --> 17:28.574
I might keep watch for a bit.

17:29.854 --> 17:34.062
Watch out. Watch out! There's killer leaves!
They're back again! It's getting you too.

17:34.142 --> 17:36.618
Get them out of my face or you're
gonna get a killer stick up your ass!

17:36.698 --> 17:39.351
Keep moving, guys. It's gonna rain soon.

17:39.831 --> 17:42.941
Rain? There's not a cloud in the sky.

17:44.301 --> 17:47.739
I thought you said the rainy season
didn't start for two weeks!

17:47.819 --> 17:51.084
In rainy season, this is a light shower!

17:52.043 --> 17:54.087
How did you know it was gonna rain?

17:54.579 --> 17:58.536
- I know everything.
- I bet you can talk to the animals too, yeah?

17:58.816 --> 18:00.827
To monkeys I can.

18:02.019 --> 18:03.527
Sure.

18:04.222 --> 18:05.767
Watch it! Not too close.

18:05.847 --> 18:09.468
The threads will burn.
And the whole thing falls apart.

18:11.512 --> 18:14.442
Don't worry. Tomorrow,
we'll find some real food.

18:14.732 --> 18:16.610
It's right there.

18:17.669 --> 18:19.454
It's waiting for us.

18:19.804 --> 18:24.300
That'll be good, Papa. 'Cause you have to
provide for your hungry children, you know?

18:52.504 --> 18:56.149
- Do you see Karl?
- He's just gone on ahead. It's okay.

19:01.011 --> 19:02.868
- Jesus, Marcus!
- Yossi, let me look at that.

19:02.948 --> 19:07.406
- I have something in my bag...
- No, Marcus, stop! Keep walking.

19:09.187 --> 19:10.508
- Okay.
- Come on, go!

19:10.588 --> 19:12.799
We need more than one machete.

19:17.829 --> 19:19.405
Shit!

19:21.433 --> 19:22.714
Karl!

19:23.134 --> 19:24.556
Guys...

19:24.636 --> 19:26.584
Kevin, what if he didn't go that way?
What if he...

19:26.664 --> 19:29.994
- No, he said Asariamas is on the river.
- No! No. We're going to wait.

19:30.074 --> 19:32.920
Marcus, pick up your shit.
He's not coming back. Let's go.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.267
I'm not getting lost just because
you don't want to wait.

19:35.347 --> 19:38.536
- Marcus, we're not lost. We're on a trail.
- You don't know. Karl?

19:38.616 --> 19:40.205
- The river is just down there!
- Karl?

19:40.285 --> 19:42.840
- Marcus, Asariamas is on the river.
- Karl?

19:42.920 --> 19:45.931
- Marcus... stop!
- Karl!

19:48.393 --> 19:50.615
- Why are you here, man?
- What?

19:50.695 --> 19:54.529
I mean, seriously, you're not enjoying
any of this. Why did you come here?

19:54.609 --> 19:57.672
- Hey! I'm enjoying myself, okay?
- Wait. Quiet.

19:57.752 --> 20:02.332
- Quiet? Kevin, what are you talking about?
- Quiet! Be quiet! Quiet!

20:05.209 --> 20:06.803
What is that?

20:11.382 --> 20:15.461
Guys? Kevin, please, let's take
our backpacks off and go. Okay?

20:22.692 --> 20:24.503
What is that?

20:34.238 --> 20:37.483
- Asariamas?
- Asariamas.

20:47.719 --> 20:49.262
Okay.

20:52.857 --> 20:56.781
Hey. Next time you're gonna wander
off without us, let us know, okay?

20:56.861 --> 20:59.917
- We thought we were lost.
- I'm sorry.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.920
I didn't know I was supposed to
hold your hand the whole time.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.928
I thought you wanted an adventure.

21:07.539 --> 21:09.022
<i>Hola!</i>

21:24.322 --> 21:25.899
Asariamas.

21:44.575 --> 21:46.318
I'm sorry about before.

21:46.398 --> 21:49.123
- No, man, I'm sorry too.
- Pass it here.

21:49.203 --> 21:52.537
Hey... hey, guys? It looks like
we're the main show in town.

21:52.617 --> 21:54.194
What?

21:58.122 --> 21:59.859
Hello, everyone.

22:00.758 --> 22:02.959
That old lady's staring at my junk.

22:11.109 --> 22:12.781
Yeah.

22:17.742 --> 22:20.298
It's like if you mixed puke and shit...

22:20.378 --> 22:22.866
...it would taste better than this.

22:23.110 --> 22:24.235
Well.

22:24.345 --> 22:26.675
They were stolen.

22:31.423 --> 22:34.190
- Let me help you there.
- Okay.

22:50.442 --> 22:52.664
Yeah, of course, please.

22:52.744 --> 22:55.700
You are so brave! You are so brave!

22:55.780 --> 22:57.423
How old are you?

23:14.849 --> 23:16.575
Okay. Let's go!

23:32.717 --> 23:35.594
Hey! I found gold!

23:39.022 --> 23:41.851
- Back off!
- Cut it out!

23:49.734 --> 23:51.678
Keep your arms out.

23:52.136 --> 23:53.812
Still.

23:55.139 --> 23:56.700
Amazing.

24:04.649 --> 24:06.525
Look at the world.

24:07.384 --> 24:09.273
Perfectly balanced.

24:09.353 --> 24:12.198
The problem is us. People.

24:12.824 --> 24:16.952
We're the cancer.
We deserve to disappear, seriously.

24:18.362 --> 24:21.793
Communism isn't the answer.
Neither is revolution. I tried both.

24:21.873 --> 24:24.967
The solution is automation.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.092
Mathematical Cosmo politics.

24:28.172 --> 24:30.662
Put a freaking computer in charge.

24:30.742 --> 24:35.354
No ego trips, no pride.
A computer program for the common good.

24:36.814 --> 24:40.226
By the way, I got in trouble for saying that.

24:41.418 --> 24:43.475
I made myself pretty clear.

24:43.555 --> 24:45.397
They're still looking for me.

24:59.604 --> 25:01.260
Monkeys.

25:21.522 --> 25:24.944
Karl! Just shoot it! Just shoot it!

25:32.336 --> 25:35.409
In the jungle... never waste a bullet?

25:35.489 --> 25:37.534
It's gonna be the best meat you ever tasted.

25:43.881 --> 25:45.084
What?

25:45.617 --> 25:47.861
Eat, you pussies.

26:20.835 --> 26:24.213
I'll be damned. It's good. It's really good.

26:26.290 --> 26:27.933
Marcus.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.421
It's just meat. It's good.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.643
Okay.

26:44.375 --> 26:48.787
- Marcus, it really is okay.
- But I just... I can't. I mean, it...

26:50.214 --> 26:52.725
What did you think
you were gonna eat out here?

26:56.520 --> 26:58.764
I'll cook him some rice.

26:59.190 --> 27:01.312
Better keep the fire going tonight.

27:01.532 --> 27:04.457
If there are monkeys, there are also jaguars.

27:05.129 --> 27:07.251
They are monkey hunters...

27:07.331 --> 27:09.208
...and for them...

27:09.400 --> 27:11.668
...we are just big, stupid monkeys.

27:13.636 --> 27:15.410
Okay.

28:00.351 --> 28:02.235
Just for insurances...

28:04.155 --> 28:06.377
- Yeah.
- Keep them dry, just keep them dry.

28:06.457 --> 28:09.867
Every time we stop, take your
shoes off and spread your toes.

28:09.947 --> 28:11.837
Hey, Marcus?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.940
I'll carry some of your load tomorrow, okay?

28:15.099 --> 28:16.859
Yeah, me too.

28:17.534 --> 28:19.344
Thank you, guys.

28:47.899 --> 28:49.887
You know, when the storms build up...

28:49.967 --> 28:53.390
Karl said we have to make it out
before the rainy season...

28:53.470 --> 28:55.532
...but we're never gonna do it
if we're going this slow.

28:55.612 --> 28:57.717
It's Marcus.

28:57.797 --> 29:00.529
He's acting like a... a girl scout.

29:01.145 --> 29:03.155
Come on, it's his feet.

29:03.314 --> 29:06.992
You and me are handling it, right?
But look at him.

29:07.952 --> 29:09.963
Clinging on to his papa.

29:35.579 --> 29:37.423
I guess I'll turn in.

29:45.589 --> 29:49.468
- Yeah, I'm pretty tired too.
- Yossi! No, please... I...

29:50.661 --> 29:54.545
I am sorry that I can't keep up.
You know this is not my fault.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.209
My feet are not my fault!

29:58.269 --> 30:01.146
You know, it's like... because of this...

30:02.839 --> 30:04.947
...we are not friends anymore?

30:05.742 --> 30:08.153
Nothing's changed.

30:13.484 --> 30:15.494
Get some rest, okay?

30:57.194 --> 31:00.952
So, we stay here until Marcus
can walk and... back to Asariamas.

31:01.032 --> 31:02.719
- From here?
- Yeah.

31:02.799 --> 31:07.458
- We're what, 3, 4 days from the Chico?
- Yes, but Marcus can't walk four days.

31:07.538 --> 31:09.548
It's fine, we carry him.

31:10.304 --> 31:12.129
That's fantastic, genius.

31:12.209 --> 31:14.648
We'll watch you. It's impossible. We can't.

31:14.728 --> 31:17.605
No, what we can't do is give up!

31:18.649 --> 31:23.074
All right. So, you guys stay here.
I go and find the Toromonas...

31:23.154 --> 31:25.609
...come back with them,
take you to their village.

31:25.689 --> 31:28.967
No. You're not going anywhere.
We're not staying here without you.

31:29.426 --> 31:33.450
Then we stay here until Marcus
can walk, and go back to Asariamas.

31:33.530 --> 31:37.977
No! No, no, no. We are not going back.
We're not... not going back.

31:40.004 --> 31:43.864
Come on, guys. We've come this far.
There's no way we can stop now.

31:47.344 --> 31:49.758
- Okay. What's going on?
- Okay, so, we'll...

31:49.838 --> 31:51.690
Karl wants to go back.

31:54.118 --> 31:57.221
Wait. There's another way to do this.

31:57.301 --> 31:59.388
Hey, can we build a raft here?

32:01.658 --> 32:06.383
- What, and head downriver from here?
- Yeah. Look, if we build one here...

32:06.463 --> 32:10.021
...we can take it down past
Curiplaya to Rurrenabaque...

32:10.101 --> 32:12.957
...and from there, we can just fly to La Paz.

32:13.237 --> 32:15.359
We'll still see the jungle,
maybe even the Toromonas.

32:15.439 --> 32:18.355
Yeah, look, it's easy
with the finger on the map.

32:18.435 --> 32:21.720
- This river is not easy.
- Is it runnable?

32:23.327 --> 32:25.423
Is it runnable?

32:28.485 --> 32:30.867
- I guess.
- Well, then, it's doable.

32:30.947 --> 32:33.166
You want to at least give it a try?

32:35.759 --> 32:37.970
I'm in. Marcus?

32:38.329 --> 32:39.985
Yeah, okay.

32:42.433 --> 32:45.678
Great. Three against one. We go on the river!

33:11.545 --> 33:14.840
Fuck! What the hell is that?

33:15.166 --> 33:16.553
It's a fire ant.

33:16.633 --> 33:19.923
The first missionaries took Indians
who wouldn't believe in baby Jesus...

33:20.003 --> 33:24.421
...they tied them on trees
and covered them with fire ants.

33:24.501 --> 33:27.030
After that, let me tell you, they believed.

33:27.110 --> 33:28.460
Yeah.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.442
- Have some water.
- Do you have enough?

33:38.522 --> 33:41.060
Yeah, yeah. We share, okay?

33:41.140 --> 33:43.735
- Thanks, man.
- That's okay.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.642
Guys, look.

33:51.168 --> 33:53.992
What one man can't do with one knife, no?

34:00.177 --> 34:05.102
We must work as a team, okay?
If there is calm water, we use the paddles.

34:05.182 --> 34:08.786
When there are rapids, the poles only, okay?

34:09.386 --> 34:13.444
You stay on the front, you in the back.
You must listen to everything I say, okay?

34:13.524 --> 34:14.985
Yeah.

34:15.065 --> 34:16.612
Okay?

34:16.693 --> 34:18.020
You're the captain.

34:19.295 --> 34:21.139
Okay. Let's go.

34:58.235 --> 35:00.113
You okay?

35:12.433 --> 35:15.583
Okay, guys, this is it.

35:18.189 --> 35:21.867
- What about the rocks over there?
- It's okay, just follow the river.

35:22.693 --> 35:25.137
- Stay in the middle, okay?
- Okay.

35:27.998 --> 35:29.808
Okay, Karl?

35:30.233 --> 35:31.877
Karl?

35:32.303 --> 35:35.380
Left. Go left! To the left!

35:41.244 --> 35:43.334
- Hang on!
- Let's go with it!

35:43.414 --> 35:47.003
- Okay. Okay.
- To the right! To the right!

35:47.083 --> 35:48.972
- Which way do we go?
- Go to the right!

35:49.052 --> 35:51.679
- Karl! Karl! Listen to me. Calm down.
- Oh, my God!

35:51.759 --> 35:54.205
- Follow the river!
- Okay!

35:54.285 --> 35:56.780
Take the pole! The pole!

35:56.860 --> 35:59.716
Fucking get off the pole! Follow the river!

36:00.096 --> 36:01.874
Yossi, the rock!

36:02.466 --> 36:05.478
- I see it!
- Be careful, be careful, Yossi, okay?

36:06.070 --> 36:08.359
Okay, guys! Come on! Just let it go!

36:08.439 --> 36:10.844
- The pole's gone!
- You don't know what you're doing!

36:10.924 --> 36:12.829
- To the right!
- Karl!

36:15.611 --> 36:17.121
Shit!

36:18.549 --> 36:21.337
- No, listen!
- Give us one instruction!

36:21.417 --> 36:24.175
- Go left! Go left!
- Oh, my God!

36:24.255 --> 36:26.042
- Go left!
- To the right!

36:26.122 --> 36:28.444
Follow the river!

36:28.524 --> 36:31.247
- Just shut the fuck up and paddle.
- Just listen to me...

36:31.327 --> 36:33.016
- Hey!
- Come on! Hey!

36:33.096 --> 36:36.420
- You're gonna get us all killed!
- We're in the middle of a river.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.974
- Okay.
- We gotta go over there!

36:41.104 --> 36:43.292
Kevin, Yossi, please pick up
your paddles. Listen to Karl.

36:43.372 --> 36:46.401
Shut up! Shut up!

36:46.941 --> 36:49.828
- Go to the right bank! That's it!
- Okay.

36:50.213 --> 36:51.757
Paddle!

36:52.115 --> 36:54.160
Yossi, pick up your paddle.

36:57.654 --> 36:59.197
Shit!

37:04.027 --> 37:05.974
So now you're giving orders?
You can't just listen to Karl?

37:06.054 --> 37:08.073
Shut the fuck up!

37:14.905 --> 37:17.526
This is not Oregon... dude! Don't you get it?

37:17.606 --> 37:19.985
- You have no idea what you...
- Shut up!

37:20.444 --> 37:23.521
Karl... tell us the plan.

37:24.114 --> 37:27.159
The plan? I'll tell you the plan.

37:27.884 --> 37:29.373
We camp here.

37:29.453 --> 37:33.180
Tomorrow, we schlep the raft along
the river until we pass those rapids.

37:33.260 --> 37:38.098
I go hunting now. And Captain America
here can go and fuck himself.

37:38.178 --> 37:39.783
Great work, Kevin. Congratulations.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.353
The only guy who knows where we are
and what we're going to do...

37:42.433 --> 37:45.021
- ...and he just walked away.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:45.101 --> 37:48.546
You're such a fucking let-down,
I can't even believe it.

38:07.558 --> 38:09.505
Did you see Karl on the raft?

38:14.397 --> 38:16.274
He was terrified.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.645
He had no idea what he was doing.
He can't even read the river.

38:22.072 --> 38:24.149
You know what I think?

38:27.978 --> 38:30.022
Karl can't swim.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.161
Holy shit.

38:36.420 --> 38:40.389
You have to go and look for him, Kevin.
You upset him. It's not fair.

38:40.469 --> 38:44.136
- Papa looks after us.
- Oh, enough with the Papa shit, Marcus.

38:45.328 --> 38:46.839
Jesus.

38:49.099 --> 38:50.908
I'll go.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.758
Karl?

39:08.118 --> 39:09.661
Karl?

39:43.486 --> 39:45.709
Karl? What are you doing?

39:45.789 --> 39:48.144
- You didn't see it?
- See what?

39:48.224 --> 39:49.880
Jaguar.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.003
Scared it off.

39:52.596 --> 39:54.940
Probably thought you were a stupid ape.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.101
What, Karl?

40:20.623 --> 40:22.234
Come on. Let's go.

40:23.393 --> 40:25.403
Go ahead. Good luck.

40:26.863 --> 40:29.052
I'm walking out from here.

40:29.132 --> 40:31.243
No more river for me.

40:32.168 --> 40:35.562
Is this... is this about the rapids?
What do you want me to say, sorry?

40:35.642 --> 40:39.295
Don't be silly. You're the captain now.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.866
I'm hiking to Ipurama. It's three days.

40:42.946 --> 40:46.570
You can come with me or you can
be fish food, I don't give a shit.

40:46.650 --> 40:48.626
Do whatever the fuck you want.

40:49.586 --> 40:51.463
For now...

40:52.288 --> 40:54.532
...I go and take a nice dump...

40:54.825 --> 40:57.719
...in the world's biggest <i>baño</i>.

40:57.994 --> 41:00.639
And you decide what you want to do, boss.

41:03.967 --> 41:06.178
One against three.

41:22.618 --> 41:24.237
Shit.

41:24.317 --> 41:26.943
I've been on rivers my whole life...

41:27.023 --> 41:28.779
...and I don't have a death wish.

41:28.859 --> 41:31.782
But I am telling you, we can do this river.

41:31.862 --> 41:33.939
I want to carry on too, but...

41:37.100 --> 41:38.944
...what about Marcus?

41:39.435 --> 41:41.714
He's going to want to come with us.

41:43.356 --> 41:45.487
He'll be safer with Karl.

41:46.977 --> 41:48.786
It's tough.

41:49.613 --> 41:52.135
But it's wrong for him to come with us.

41:52.215 --> 41:54.442
It's wrong for us to take him.

41:55.318 --> 41:57.162
I'm not taking him.

41:58.021 --> 42:00.410
He's starting to lose it.

42:00.490 --> 42:02.300
He's gotta get out.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.403
You okay with that?

42:06.997 --> 42:08.873
I don't know.

42:13.203 --> 42:15.013
I'm going to talk to him.

42:30.353 --> 42:31.863
Hey.

42:32.689 --> 42:34.786
What's the matter?

42:37.627 --> 42:39.783
I've been talking to Kevin...

42:39.863 --> 42:42.474
...and he's going to continue on the river.

42:43.433 --> 42:45.243
Without Karl?

42:46.209 --> 42:49.739
You know, I love Kevin but he's crazy.
That is insane.

42:49.819 --> 42:52.863
- He can't go alone. That's going to be...
- I know, Marcus, I know. I...

42:52.943 --> 42:54.619
...tried to change his mind.

42:56.246 --> 42:58.669
Look, if he goes on his own,
he's never gonna make it, right?

42:58.749 --> 43:02.160
So one of us has to go with him. And...

43:04.520 --> 43:08.366
Marcus, your feet are bad.
You can't get back on the raft, right?

43:09.793 --> 43:11.783
My feet are fine.

43:12.763 --> 43:15.372
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:17.033 --> 43:20.712
I've been bathing them every day
since we started building the raft, you know?

43:21.805 --> 43:23.615
Okay, well, that's...

43:24.140 --> 43:26.618
...that's good news, actually, for...

43:27.644 --> 43:30.122
...for me. To be honest, I'd...

43:30.580 --> 43:34.677
...I would rather go out with Karl,
just to get out in three days...

43:34.757 --> 43:36.761
...be done with it all.

43:37.821 --> 43:39.943
So, if that's okay with you, maybe...

43:40.023 --> 43:42.067
...just you and Kevin go on the raft.

43:46.562 --> 43:48.573
No, I am sorry.

43:49.499 --> 43:51.776
But I can't go out with him alone.

43:53.770 --> 43:56.381
I mean, you see how he is with me.

43:58.641 --> 44:01.765
My feet, they slowed down
the whole trip, and I'm so sorry.

44:01.845 --> 44:04.522
It's fine, I understand.

44:06.216 --> 44:08.772
If it's okay with you, I would...

44:08.852 --> 44:11.096
...I would really like to go with Karl.

44:13.690 --> 44:17.080
So you're okay,
with your feet being how they are?

44:17.160 --> 44:19.403
- Yeah.
- I...

44:20.563 --> 44:22.139
Okay.

44:23.366 --> 44:25.095
Really?

44:25.175 --> 44:26.840
Yeah.

44:35.245 --> 44:37.054
Thank you, Yossi.

44:49.592 --> 44:51.598
Okay, we are here.

44:51.678 --> 44:54.364
There are rapids everywhere.
Here, here, here.

44:54.444 --> 44:58.128
This is the worst.
You'll be there probably by tomorrow.

44:58.208 --> 45:01.579
- Mal Paso San Pedro.
- Can we make it through there?

45:01.694 --> 45:04.506
Don't even try. There are cliffs
on both sides. No shore, no nothing.

45:04.586 --> 45:06.818
Once you're in, you're dead.

45:07.503 --> 45:09.955
And how are we gonna know when to stop?

45:11.281 --> 45:14.424
There's a beach on the right side.
You have to stop there.

45:14.504 --> 45:19.139
If you can't, jump and swim for it.
Do not go into the canyon.

45:19.219 --> 45:20.672
Okay.

45:24.147 --> 45:25.815
- You take the machete.
- Yeah.

45:25.895 --> 45:28.324
- I keep the shotgun.
- Yeah. That's fine.

45:28.404 --> 45:32.022
- And food, we split 50-50.
- No, no. You need more.

45:32.102 --> 45:35.698
We'll be out in three days.
We reach Ipurama...

45:35.778 --> 45:39.984
...get donkeys and food.
We ride back to Apolo like kings.

45:40.210 --> 45:41.653
Right?

46:09.472 --> 46:11.183
You're so full of shit.

46:13.409 --> 46:14.919
Sure, Karl.

46:21.084 --> 46:22.928
Man of action.

46:32.595 --> 46:34.606
We'll be waiting for you.

46:43.739 --> 46:45.817
Lake Titicaca.

46:46.242 --> 46:49.244
If that captain hadn't turned back,
we would never have met.

46:52.148 --> 46:53.837
Okay, so...

46:53.917 --> 46:55.505
- ...good luck, Kevin.
- Yeah, you too.

46:55.585 --> 46:57.661
And be safe.

46:57.988 --> 46:59.531
Yeah.

47:00.456 --> 47:01.966
Hey.

47:02.392 --> 47:06.299
- At the hostel, we make a big meal?
- Yeah, sounds great.

47:06.379 --> 47:08.280
Yeah? All we can eat?

47:08.779 --> 47:13.245
Yep. And I promise, back in La Paz,
everything will be like it was before.

47:14.424 --> 47:17.515
Yeah. Yeah.

47:47.503 --> 47:50.031
- Ready?
- Ready.

47:56.178 --> 47:57.822
Oar, please.

48:56.139 --> 48:58.294
Hey, do you know what day it is?

48:58.374 --> 49:02.219
December... 1st, maybe. I think.

49:04.314 --> 49:06.591
Maybe I can make it home for Christmas.

49:29.139 --> 49:32.617
Can we stop for the night soon
and try to catch a fish?

49:33.776 --> 49:36.188
There's still an hour of daylight left.

49:38.114 --> 49:40.536
I think we try to get closer to the canyon.

49:40.616 --> 49:42.459
What do you think?

50:09.112 --> 50:11.322
Oh, shit!

50:11.614 --> 50:12.722
Kevin?

50:12.802 --> 50:16.260
Get your paddle. Get your paddle! Come on!

50:16.619 --> 50:18.129
Quick!

50:20.486 --> 50:23.079
Get your paddle! Paddle, Yossi!

50:23.159 --> 50:25.708
- I am!
- Come on!

50:26.862 --> 50:28.788
- Paddle!
- Jeez, this is too strong!

50:28.868 --> 50:31.664
- Kevin, what do we do?
- There's the beach! There's the beach, go!

50:31.744 --> 50:33.623
Okay, hard! Hard!

50:34.203 --> 50:35.958
Fuck, we're drifting!

50:36.038 --> 50:39.996
- Come on, paddle! Push!
- We're never gonna make it!

50:40.076 --> 50:42.584
- Push!
- I'm pushing! It's too strong!

50:42.664 --> 50:45.573
- Come on, Yossi!
- Kevin!

50:53.323 --> 50:55.311
It's okay!

50:55.791 --> 50:57.869
Right, right, right!

50:58.728 --> 51:00.938
Come on! We're gonna do this!

51:02.164 --> 51:03.975
Oh, fuck!

51:05.167 --> 51:09.246
- Rock! Kevin!
- Get down! Get down! Go!

51:20.215 --> 51:22.274
Hold tight, Yossi!

51:22.763 --> 51:24.340
Oh, Jesus!

51:24.420 --> 51:28.346
- Kevin! Kevin!
- It's okay! Hold on, Yossi!

51:32.995 --> 51:35.439
- Kevin!
- Hold tight!

51:38.367 --> 51:40.273
Oh, no... No!

51:40.353 --> 51:43.926
- Okay! Okay! I'm going across!
- What?

51:44.006 --> 51:47.079
- I'm going over! We can't stay here.
- No! Kevin, you can't leave me!

51:47.159 --> 51:51.174
Listen to me, listen to me! When I get
to the bank, throw me the machete!

51:51.254 --> 51:53.269
I'm gonna cut some vine
and pull you out, okay?

51:53.349 --> 51:55.605
- No! It's too dangerous!
- It's the only way.

51:55.685 --> 51:58.794
- Kevin, please! You'll never make it!
- It's the only way!

51:58.874 --> 52:02.260
I'm gonna make it, okay?
I'm gonna make it. I'm not leaving you.

52:02.340 --> 52:05.127
I'm not leaving you, okay? Just hold on!

52:05.288 --> 52:06.931
No! Kevin!

52:24.847 --> 52:26.404
Yes!

52:28.584 --> 52:30.443
Yossi, hold on!

52:30.523 --> 52:32.497
Hurry! Hurry!

52:33.223 --> 52:36.031
Here, Kevin, the raft's moving!

52:36.111 --> 52:40.938
- Kevin!
- Yossi! Yossi, the machete!

52:49.104 --> 52:50.929
Yossi!

56:39.301 --> 56:40.845
Kevin!

56:42.505 --> 56:44.415
Kevin!

57:52.071 --> 57:53.917
Holy shit.

58:00.149 --> 58:01.658
No.

59:01.010 --> 59:02.553
Superman.

59:17.559 --> 59:19.070
Kevin!

59:26.702 --> 59:28.229
Kevin?

59:31.273 --> 59:32.277
Kevin!

59:35.695 --> 59:36.738
Kevin!

59:46.922 --> 59:48.765
Kevin!

59:54.296 --> 59:55.872
Kevin?

01:02:34.857 --> 01:02:36.427
Shit.

01:02:45.334 --> 01:02:47.341
I'm a man of action.

01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:11.234
Come on!

01:04:13.422 --> 01:04:16.935
<i># Pretend you're happy when you're blue #</i>

01:04:19.794 --> 01:04:24.628
<i># It isn't very hard to do #</i>

01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:31.861
<i># And you'll find happiness without an end #</i>

01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:36.603
<i># Whenever you pretend #</i>

01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:40.136
Fuck!

01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:17.310
<i>You're gonna be saved in the Curiplaya.</i>

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.594
<i>You have a map, and people
are coming to save you.</i>

01:05:22.674 --> 01:05:24.613
All you have to do...

01:05:24.693 --> 01:05:26.481
...is keep going...

01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:28.869
...and going and going and going.

01:05:39.408 --> 01:05:41.418
Great. It moves.

01:05:50.052 --> 01:05:51.595
Hey.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:55.265
Yossi?

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.280
What?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.870
Kevin?

01:06:04.316 --> 01:06:05.887
Kevin?

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.578
Yossi.

01:06:07.936 --> 01:06:10.981
Marcus? What?

01:06:13.975 --> 01:06:15.386
Yossi.

01:06:16.445 --> 01:06:18.021
Marcus!

01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:44.606
Come on. Come on.

01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:23.666
Hello?

01:10:24.793 --> 01:10:27.437
Hello! Hello!

01:10:27.996 --> 01:10:29.506
<i>Hola!</i>

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.510
I'm sorry.

01:11:33.828 --> 01:11:35.438
Hello!

01:11:37.265 --> 01:11:38.775
Hello!

01:11:46.507 --> 01:11:48.084
Hello!

01:12:17.538 --> 01:12:19.082
No.

01:12:45.566 --> 01:12:49.290
So... this must be Curiplaya.

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.114
So, then...

01:12:51.473 --> 01:12:53.549
...I have to get to...

01:12:54.242 --> 01:12:56.049
...Rurrenabaque.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.155
That is a long... way.

01:13:00.549 --> 01:13:02.058
No.

01:13:02.617 --> 01:13:07.778
It's not a long way
for the luckiest man on Earth.

01:13:08.089 --> 01:13:10.729
It's just... there.

01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:13.366
You can walk there on these feet.

01:13:17.165 --> 01:13:21.923
Okay. Okay, Yossi. You need to do this.

01:13:22.003 --> 01:13:24.025
You have to get them dry.

01:13:24.105 --> 01:13:25.916
Come on.

01:13:57.939 --> 01:14:01.429
I'm so sorry, Marcus. I didn't know.

01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:04.240
I just didn't want to be the weakest.

01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:07.961
I was more scared than you...

01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:10.326
...because I'm a coward.

01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:14.973
Because I am a coward and I deserve...

01:14:15.053 --> 01:14:16.877
...all of this.

01:15:13.281 --> 01:15:14.857
Kevin!

01:15:16.384 --> 01:15:19.061
Kevin! I'm here!

01:15:19.604 --> 01:15:21.147
Kevin!

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.866
Kevin!

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:44.854
No! No!

01:15:46.114 --> 01:15:48.349
No! No!

01:15:48.429 --> 01:15:50.294
You. No!

01:15:53.487 --> 01:15:55.114
Stupid idiot!

01:15:58.192 --> 01:16:00.120
University.

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:02.581
Law school.

01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:05.529
Papa, I know. I know
how you feel and I'm sorry.

01:16:05.609 --> 01:16:07.560
Not one shekel!

01:16:09.804 --> 01:16:13.092
You will not see one shekel from me.

01:16:13.642 --> 01:16:17.123
I don't need your money.
I'm not asking for it.

01:16:20.915 --> 01:16:22.958
It's only a year.

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:29.744
Stay... on the river!

01:16:29.824 --> 01:16:32.714
Stay on the river! Stay on the river!

01:16:32.794 --> 01:16:35.471
Karl always said stay on the river!

01:16:49.443 --> 01:16:52.523
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:55.183 --> 01:16:57.938
Okay, Yossi, just keep walking.

01:16:58.018 --> 01:16:59.895
Keep going.

01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:32.500
I know your type.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.105
You just don't know when to give up.

01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:04.054
Yossi.

01:19:34.864 --> 01:19:37.319
No! No! No!

01:20:02.703 --> 01:20:04.546
Look, Papá.

01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:46.106
First of all, you'll see Captain Armando.

01:20:49.851 --> 01:20:52.540
If he didn't drown, he wouldn't just give up.

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.697
We have to go and find him.

01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:26.925
Hello? Wait! No! Wait! Wait, wait!

01:21:27.005 --> 01:21:30.411
Hello! Hello! I'm here!

01:21:30.491 --> 01:21:33.681
Down here! Hello! No! No!

01:21:33.761 --> 01:21:35.305
No!

01:21:41.202 --> 01:21:43.680
Hey! Can't you fly any lower?

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.864
No, I can't do that.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:57.828
No!

01:22:27.748 --> 01:22:30.754
Hey. We were so high,
we couldn't even see anything.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.674
Listen, young man...

01:22:33.754 --> 01:22:36.998
- You tell me to listen. You keep telling me...
- Listen, please!

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:39.932
It has been almost three weeks.

01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:43.238
There is no-one to look for.

01:22:43.697 --> 01:22:45.475
You don't know that.

01:22:46.134 --> 01:22:47.922
You did all you could.

01:22:48.002 --> 01:22:51.139
It's a miracle you survived. Now, go home.

01:22:51.219 --> 01:22:55.329
Listen, I know it doesn't make any sense
to you. I know that it seems hopeless.

01:22:55.409 --> 01:22:58.732
But I'm telling you, I know, in here,
I know in my heart, that he is alive.

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:01.988
I just need some... I need some help. Okay?

01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:05.199
If you can just talk to the pilot,
just give me some kind of chance here.

01:23:05.279 --> 01:23:08.230
Listen to me, I want to help you,
really, really, but...

01:23:08.522 --> 01:23:11.879
- You say that. You say that.
- I can't. I can't. I can't, really.

01:23:11.959 --> 01:23:13.614
- You can't?
- Yep, I can't.

01:23:13.694 --> 01:23:15.749
Okay, fine. You know what?

01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:19.074
You don't want to help me,
I'll go upriver myself.

01:23:20.434 --> 01:23:22.991
What if you die in looking for him?

01:23:23.071 --> 01:23:24.914
Then I die!

01:23:29.677 --> 01:23:31.280
Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.823
Wait.

01:23:34.428 --> 01:23:35.925
Come.

01:23:39.019 --> 01:23:42.865
There is maybe... someone who can help.

01:23:45.559 --> 01:23:47.329
<i>Señor</i> Tico?

01:23:49.505 --> 01:23:51.562
Captain Armando...

01:23:52.042 --> 01:23:56.116
...told me that you know
the Tuichi River better than anyone.

01:23:57.388 --> 01:23:59.216
I have a friend...

01:23:59.296 --> 01:24:01.714
...who is lost in the river.

01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:04.561
The missing one?

01:24:05.878 --> 01:24:08.514
A gringo lost 17 days in the jungle?

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.555
He won't survive.

01:24:10.635 --> 01:24:14.475
Your friend is having a drink
with the Almighty up there.

01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:18.354
No, my friend is alive...

01:24:18.434 --> 01:24:22.237
...and I need you to help me find him.

01:24:25.374 --> 01:24:26.979
I can't.

01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:31.575
I've never begged for anything. Anything.

01:24:31.655 --> 01:24:35.163
But I'm begging you now. Please.

01:24:36.744 --> 01:24:38.553
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.622
How much for the boat?

01:24:49.557 --> 01:24:51.400
Your boat.

01:24:52.293 --> 01:24:53.669
How much?

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:03.445
- Crazy <i>gringo.</i>
- Yeah, loco!

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.184
But really... I need it.

01:25:09.977 --> 01:25:11.487
Please.

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.827
No, no. Don't run! Please, don't run.
I'm not going to hurt you!

01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:17.665
I'm not going to hurt you! Please,
don't run away. It's fine, it's fine.

01:26:17.745 --> 01:26:22.658
My... my name... my name is Yossi.

01:26:22.983 --> 01:26:24.794
I am lost.

01:26:25.819 --> 01:26:29.009
Do you... do you speak... English?

01:26:29.089 --> 01:26:31.016
No, of course you don't...

01:26:32.993 --> 01:26:36.605
I know you can't
understand me, but... it's...

01:26:38.966 --> 01:26:40.810
...it's good to see you.

01:26:57.851 --> 01:27:00.394
We have to find the opening
in the river tomorrow...

01:27:00.474 --> 01:27:04.967
...so the... when the plane comes,
they... they can see us.

01:27:05.693 --> 01:27:07.950
I promise you, we'll be fine.

01:27:08.496 --> 01:27:11.151
And here. I know it's not... it's not much...

01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:14.580
...but it's better
than just the ground, you know?

01:27:15.436 --> 01:27:18.425
Yeah, I'm not... just you, not...

01:27:18.505 --> 01:27:21.384
So that you're safe. Keep the bugs out.

01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:25.654
I'm going to protect you.

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:33.039
I'm sorry, I just have to...
I just have to do one thing.

01:27:36.857 --> 01:27:38.546
Okay.

01:27:38.626 --> 01:27:41.036
I'm just... just checking.

01:27:58.846 --> 01:28:02.670
We just... have to keep heading
for Rurrenabaque...

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:04.559
...and never stop...

01:28:05.218 --> 01:28:08.479
...and always keep an eye for the plane.

01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:10.911
And the pilot's gonna see us...

01:28:10.991 --> 01:28:14.515
...he's gonna signal to us
with a tilt of his wings...

01:28:14.595 --> 01:28:16.438
...and we'll be saved.

01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:20.253
And you're gonna meet my friends.

01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:23.345
But out here, something...

01:28:23.837 --> 01:28:25.647
...happened to us...

01:28:33.814 --> 01:28:36.470
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm all right.

01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:38.134
Look.

01:28:39.603 --> 01:28:42.075
See, I told you... we would find fruit.

01:28:42.155 --> 01:28:45.612
It's a bit rotten, but it's okay.

01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:52.376
You have to eat! No!
You have to eat! You have to eat!

01:28:52.456 --> 01:28:54.777
I can't do this by myself!

01:28:54.868 --> 01:28:57.292
You can't give up! Eat!

01:28:57.738 --> 01:29:01.217
I'm starving too!
I am hurting too! My feet are...

01:29:04.945 --> 01:29:08.101
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:11.141
We all... we just have to... get some rest.

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:15.709
And, look. Look, every night,
God sends us a tree to sleep under.

01:29:15.789 --> 01:29:18.746
This... this is a gift from God.

01:29:18.826 --> 01:29:22.816
We are not alone here.
God is walking beside us.

01:29:22.896 --> 01:29:25.544
You know, He has one hand on our shoulder.

01:29:25.999 --> 01:29:27.688
He is with us.

01:29:27.768 --> 01:29:30.258
Lie down here, next to me.

01:29:30.338 --> 01:29:33.949
It's fine. I'll just protect you.
We'll keep each other warm.

01:29:37.578 --> 01:29:41.390
That's it. It's going to be all right.

01:29:42.516 --> 01:29:45.727
Just... stay here with me.

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.864
We can sleep now.

01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.566
You'll be safe.

01:29:52.325 --> 01:29:54.203
God is with us.

01:29:59.633 --> 01:30:02.890
It's okay. Just go to sleep.

01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:05.114
Go to sleep.

01:30:23.456 --> 01:30:25.034
What?

01:31:18.226 --> 01:31:19.789
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:52.787
No.

01:31:54.915 --> 01:31:57.125
No, no.

01:32:00.621 --> 01:32:04.499
Okay, no, don't... don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:13.621
May God bless you and keep you.

01:32:13.781 --> 01:32:16.413
May God make his face shine
and show you his favor.

01:32:16.493 --> 01:32:19.015
May God lift up his face and give you peace.

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:27.077
Come home alive, Yossi.

01:33:40.687 --> 01:33:42.497
Stay with me.

01:33:43.023 --> 01:33:46.715
Don't you fucking break. Don't you break.

01:34:08.516 --> 01:34:11.882
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:34:16.491 --> 01:34:17.832
Yes.

01:34:41.514 --> 01:34:43.771
<i>We have to find the opening
in the river tomorrow...</i>

01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:47.540
<i>We have to find the opening
in the river, so they can see us...</i>

01:34:50.457 --> 01:34:52.045
<i>Yossi?</i>

01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.908
<i>Yossi.</i>

01:35:10.643 --> 01:35:12.387
<i>Yossi?</i>

01:37:00.253 --> 01:37:01.942
<i>Yossi!</i>

01:37:02.022 --> 01:37:04.331
<i>Yossi, over here!</i>

01:37:05.842 --> 01:37:08.588
- <i>Come on, Yossi!</i>
- <i>Yossi?</i>

01:37:19.839 --> 01:37:21.811
<i>Don't give up!</i>

01:37:22.909 --> 01:37:24.973
<i>Come on, Yossi!</i>

01:37:27.414 --> 01:37:29.091
<i>Yossi!</i>

01:38:48.795 --> 01:38:51.806
It's okay. It's okay.

01:38:53.433 --> 01:38:56.645
You... are gonna live.

01:38:57.337 --> 01:38:58.913
Yeah.

01:40:09.042 --> 01:40:10.885
Thank you.

01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:02.472
- What's wrong?
- We have to go back.

01:41:02.552 --> 01:41:04.628
It's impossible.

01:41:12.114 --> 01:41:14.246
You did everything you could.

01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:32.446
I'm sorry.

01:41:58.685 --> 01:42:00.762
Yossi?

01:42:03.556 --> 01:42:05.366
Go away.

01:42:13.566 --> 01:42:15.576
Okay, bring her around!

01:42:21.874 --> 01:42:24.439
Keep going, keep going!

01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:32.393
Yeah, a little more!

01:42:34.554 --> 01:42:36.130
Wait.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.900
Wait.

01:42:40.026 --> 01:42:42.204
Okay, keep going. Good. Go.

01:43:14.327 --> 01:43:15.904
Kevin.

01:43:26.072 --> 01:43:27.916
Yossi!

01:43:35.315 --> 01:43:37.337
Yossi!

01:43:37.817 --> 01:43:39.421
Turn around!

01:43:43.556 --> 01:43:46.234
Yossi! Don't move!

01:44:11.674 --> 01:44:16.271
Come here, come here.
I got you, buddy. I got you, buddy.

01:44:16.351 --> 01:44:17.827
Thank you!

01:44:18.057 --> 01:44:19.566
Hey.

01:44:21.794 --> 01:44:24.650
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I told you I wouldn't leave you.

01:44:24.730 --> 01:44:26.903
Hey, it's okay. Jesus Christ.

01:44:28.033 --> 01:44:31.691
It's okay, it's okay, Yossi.
I got you, Yossi. I got you.

01:44:31.771 --> 01:44:33.614
It's okay.

01:46:06.298 --> 01:46:08.142
That's it.

01:46:10.436 --> 01:46:12.324
Thank you, sir.

01:46:12.404 --> 01:46:14.815
- <i>Medico.</i>
- Yeah, thank you.

01:46:23.215 --> 01:46:25.259
You saved my life.

01:46:26.118 --> 01:46:27.929
You saved mine.

01:46:28.768 --> 01:46:30.864
Be right back. Okay?

01:46:43.703 --> 01:46:45.779
Thank you.

01:46:57.216 --> 01:47:00.540
Thank God, the one who was missing was found.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.630
Thank God.
