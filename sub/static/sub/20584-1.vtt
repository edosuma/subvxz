WEBVTT

01:20.432 --> 01:21.547
<i>Doing great.</i>

01:21.589 --> 01:22.421
<i>Keep breathing.</i>

01:22.889 --> 01:24.366
<i>We have the head,
keep breathing.</i>

01:25.227 --> 01:26.314
<i>I've got it now.
Here we go...</i>

01:26.530 --> 01:27.584
<i>Imagine you were born</i>

01:27.596 --> 01:29.476
<i>totally aware and conscious</i>

01:29.487 --> 01:31.348
<i>of everything around you.</i>

01:32.264 --> 01:35.224
<i>Conscious you were coming
out of someone else's body.</i>

01:35.399 --> 01:38.264
<i>Joined to it by a bloody cord</i>

01:38.853 --> 01:41.352
<i>that you are completely
covered in blood.</i>

01:41.363 --> 01:43.343
<i>We have a healthy baby boy!</i>

01:44.034 --> 01:46.325
<i>Conscious of the dry air</i>

01:46.337 --> 01:48.347
<i>entering your lungs
for the first time.</i>

01:49.536 --> 01:51.338
<i>The sharp sounds in your ears.</i>

01:51.349 --> 01:54.338
<i>- Scissors?
- The blinding light in your eyes.</i>

01:54.349 --> 01:58.338
<i>- Ten fingers, ten toes!
- Conscious that your bones</i>

01:58.349 --> 02:01.348
<i>are unbearably soft
and your life is so fragile</i>

02:01.359 --> 02:03.342
<i>it could disappear at any moment.</i>

02:04.738 --> 02:07.351
<i>That's what being
resurrected is like.</i>

02:12.339 --> 02:13.348
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

02:47.348 --> 02:49.353
<i>I can imagine nurse
Elizabeth Mansfra</i>

02:50.153 --> 02:51.554
<i>I can feel her excitement</i>

02:51.568 --> 02:54.352
<i>the day she met Dr. Victor West.</i>

02:54.363 --> 02:56.388
<i>Regenerative medicine's
new genius</i>

03:00.340 --> 03:01.364
Look at the light, please.

03:07.558 --> 03:09.340
Good morning, Miss Mansfra.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.488
Welcome to Prodigy.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.357
Where humanity's greatest
dream is coming true.

03:13.428 --> 03:15.348
Are you aware that our team of

03:15.359 --> 03:17.348
top international scientists

03:17.351 --> 03:18.349
has developed the world's most

03:18.359 --> 03:20.348
advanced regeneration program?

03:20.448 --> 03:22.348
We're the only ones capable of

03:22.359 --> 03:26.348
regenerating up to 65 percent
of the human organism.

03:26.548 --> 03:28.422
Prodigy Health Corporation...

03:28.484 --> 03:30.363
The only company in the world

03:30.374 --> 03:32.354
that can bring you immortality.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.363
Because immortality is
only a question of time.

03:39.002 --> 03:40.352
Elizabeth, I remind you that

03:40.379 --> 03:43.348
you are still bound by the
confidentiality agreement?

03:44.127 --> 03:46.355
Nothing mentioned here today
can leave the premises.

03:46.422 --> 03:47.431
Understood.

03:51.325 --> 03:52.426
Victor.

03:54.414 --> 03:56.335
This is Elizabeth Mansfra,
the nurse.

03:56.347 --> 03:57.802
Elizabeth, Dr. West.

03:57.814 --> 04:00.337
Nice to meet you.
It's an honor, Dr. West.

04:00.804 --> 04:02.337
I've read all your books.

04:04.737 --> 04:07.356
Try augmenting the levels
of catecholamines gradually.

04:07.401 --> 04:08.410
<i>Alright.</i>

04:10.430 --> 04:12.358
Excuse me.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.346
Oh, Elizabeth.
Welcome.

04:15.358 --> 04:16.367
Thank you.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.378
Ready for a visit?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.396
<i>I'll call Dr. Howard.</i>

04:20.064 --> 04:21.382
<i>Elizabeth and Victor.</i>

04:22.045 --> 04:24.349
<i>My new parents.</i>

04:25.107 --> 04:26.358
<i>This is where we work.</i>

04:26.370 --> 04:29.362
The entire wing of the building
is dedicated to the project.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.349
200,000 square feet of
facilities for Lazarus alone.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.351
And we barely even fit.

04:35.226 --> 04:37.368
How long have you
been working on it?

04:37.468 --> 04:40.368
Four years. We're finally
prepared to face reanimation.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.296
That's a scanned map of Lazarus

04:43.352 --> 04:45.349
with an accuracy
almost to the cell.

04:45.505 --> 04:47.352
We use it to study the
primary difficulties

04:47.401 --> 04:49.357
and to make decisions
before the big surgery.

04:49.446 --> 04:52.400
Like what proportion of
the body can be reanimated

04:52.420 --> 04:54.363
and what proportion
must be substituted

04:54.482 --> 04:57.400
by bionic parts and organs
developed in our laboratory.

04:58.211 --> 04:59.349
That is the operating room where

04:59.430 --> 05:02.382
multiple surgeons will work
under Victor's direction

05:02.831 --> 05:06.338
and assisted by 120 technicians
on the outside.

05:07.027 --> 05:09.342
This is a model of
a surgical robot

05:09.355 --> 05:11.067
we've designed for the operation.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.456
When's the surgery?

05:13.472 --> 05:14.884
July 25th.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.376
That gives you four weeks
to familiarize yourself

05:16.392 --> 05:19.382
with the clinical details
and to prepare your strategy.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.501
After surgery, Lazarus remains

05:20.522 --> 05:22.369
in an induced coma
for nearly two months.

05:22.380 --> 05:25.348
Giving him time to assimilate
his new organs and implants.

05:25.410 --> 05:28.356
It also allows us to address
possible reanimation defects.

05:28.377 --> 05:30.367
Now, one of your functions
while he's in a coma

05:30.386 --> 05:33.382
is to help him make that
transition into his new life.

05:33.391 --> 05:35.373
And after that, you'll be
much more than just his nurse.

05:35.396 --> 05:38.382
You'll be his
partner.

05:38.390 --> 05:39.394
Of course.

05:45.085 --> 05:46.365
Those are Lazarus' muscles

05:47.885 --> 05:49.265
I knew it could be done,

05:49.288 --> 05:51.358
but that doesn't
make it less impressive.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.367
Any questions, Elizabeth?

06:04.262 --> 06:05.352
What's Lazarus' name?

06:23.448 --> 06:24.640
Oh!

06:27.186 --> 06:30.381
<i>Why does time pass so slowly
when we're children?</i>

06:32.382 --> 06:33.390
<i>What are you doing, Marc?</i>

06:37.244 --> 06:41.386
<i>Why does the future seem
like a huge endless eternity?</i>

06:44.199 --> 06:46.486
<i>He is so tired.</i>

06:49.288 --> 06:51.395
Okay, c'mon, you can do it.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.354
That's a good boy.

06:57.224 --> 06:58.354
Let me see you.

07:03.001 --> 07:06.362
<i>Whey do we never feel
anything that intensely again?</i>

07:16.340 --> 07:17.464
<i>Only the pain.</i>

08:00.004 --> 08:02.232
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

08:02.251 --> 08:05.232
Our worst-case prognosis
has been confirmed.

08:10.002 --> 08:12.343
It's too late to operate.

08:13.003 --> 08:14.320
All that we can do right now is

08:14.332 --> 08:16.358
try to slow its
spread with treatment.

08:17.123 --> 08:20.258
At this point, radiotherapy
and co-adjuvant chemotherapy

08:20.269 --> 08:21.379
is still the most
effective option.

08:28.545 --> 08:30.366
How long have I got?

08:30.455 --> 08:32.466
Based on our experience
with this type of tumor,

08:32.479 --> 08:35.395
you'll be able to live,
more or less comfortably for

08:35.990 --> 08:37.419
about a year.

08:37.530 --> 08:40.385
And after that it's...
It's hard to say.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.688
But um...

08:44.070 --> 08:46.269
Why?

08:49.299 --> 08:50.378
So soon.

08:50.390 --> 08:51.389
I mean, um...

08:52.389 --> 08:55.389
What's the reason?
Why... why my throat?

08:58.321 --> 09:00.389
There could be many reasons, um...

09:01.092 --> 09:02.368
Bad habits.

09:02.379 --> 09:03.388
- Smoking.
- I don't smoke.

09:06.383 --> 09:07.394
It's cancer.

09:09.185 --> 09:12.365
If you undergo treatment,
and we act quickly,

09:12.378 --> 09:13.373
we might be able to
give you some more time.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.153
I need to think about it.

09:31.164 --> 09:32.265
Sure.

09:34.254 --> 09:35.265
I beat you!

09:37.242 --> 09:38.234
I beat you.

09:40.238 --> 09:41.341
This is beautiful.

09:42.330 --> 09:44.352
- Where did you find it?
- Easy.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.343
They hide under rocks.

09:47.467 --> 09:48.643
Let's cut off its tail.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.766
No!

09:49.778 --> 09:51.664
Don't do that.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.351
That's just wrong.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.360
No!

09:58.362 --> 10:00.073
- Eww.
- Ugh.

10:01.264 --> 10:03.402
You big bunch of babies.

10:04.211 --> 10:05.510
- Stop it!
- Marc...

10:06.227 --> 10:08.387
Don't be scared.
They grow back, you know.

10:11.007 --> 10:12.376
This one's tail
will never grow back.

10:13.350 --> 10:14.362
What do you mean?

10:15.880 --> 10:17.374
- No!
- What is wrong with you?

10:20.174 --> 10:22.403
<i>Time is coming back to me now.</i>

10:26.211 --> 10:27.403
<i>Slower than ever.</i>

10:30.983 --> 10:32.390
<i>You can't imagine all the things</i>

10:32.402 --> 10:34.401
<i>that need to be done to
dismantle your life.</i>

10:34.413 --> 10:36.367
<i>And prepare everything
for when you are gone.</i>

10:37.478 --> 10:39.374
<i>Starting with the simplest.</i>

10:40.004 --> 10:42.400
<i>Telling your employees,
suppliers and customers</i>

10:42.412 --> 10:45.392
<i>that someone else will be
taking your place from now on.</i>

10:46.120 --> 10:47.388
<i>That not to worry,</i>

10:47.402 --> 10:50.383
<i>that everything will continue
exactly like it has until now.</i>

10:51.274 --> 10:54.378
<i>Giving instructions on
how to finish the projects.</i>

10:55.089 --> 10:56.377
<i>Selling your shares.</i>

10:57.179 --> 10:59.146
<i>Leaving the business in good hands.</i>

11:00.006 --> 11:03.235
<i>Deciding what to do with
your most personal projects.</i>

11:03.986 --> 11:05.002
<i>With your dreams.</i>

11:08.411 --> 11:10.354
<i>Telling the people you love.</i>

11:11.104 --> 11:12.348
<i>Deciding who not to tell.</i>

11:12.369 --> 11:15.348
<i>Managing all the
concern you will awaken.</i>

11:19.006 --> 11:20.356
<i>Telling your mother.</i>

11:21.056 --> 11:24.400
<i>Explaining to her that she's
going to outlive you.</i>

11:27.117 --> 11:29.412
<i>Writing your will.</i>

11:30.012 --> 11:31.382
<i>Selling your properties.</i>

11:32.421 --> 11:34.376
<i>Emptying the house of
your personal belongings.</i>

11:36.244 --> 11:38.314
<i>Looking at them for the last time.</i>

11:42.006 --> 11:44.372
<i>When you get rid of
everything you ever were...</i>

11:46.899 --> 11:48.390
<i>What's left?</i>

11:50.580 --> 11:52.355
<i>What do you want it to be?</i>

11:54.580 --> 11:56.348
<i>What was yet to come?</i>

12:00.024 --> 12:02.357
<i>The best was yet to come.</i>

12:05.777 --> 12:08.349
<i>The best was always yet to come.</i>

12:51.302 --> 12:52.298
I got lost.

12:53.187 --> 12:55.361
I didn't know where I was.

12:56.761 --> 12:58.381
I'm here.
Baby.

12:59.277 --> 13:01.382
- I got lost and I...
- Shh... I'm here.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.329
I saw Steve today.

13:34.571 --> 13:36.334
He wants to get back together.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.383
What did you say?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.378
That I'm in love with you.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.346
That I've always been in love with you.

13:56.824 --> 13:59.362
You should get back together with him.

14:06.902 --> 14:09.358
I want to be with you through this.

14:13.091 --> 14:15.358
I want to spend the rest
of your life with you.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.458
<i>Come on, Marc, jump already.</i>

14:45.129 --> 14:46.358
<i>Rebecca's looking this way.</i>

14:46.370 --> 14:47.367
<i>Waiting to see that swan dive.</i>

14:47.380 --> 14:48.456
<i>Way to go, dude.</i>

14:49.043 --> 14:50.388
<i>Now he's gonna bellyflop.</i>

15:26.247 --> 15:29.204
What do you guys think
about cryonization?

15:30.288 --> 15:32.345
Like Walt Disney, right?

15:33.269 --> 15:36.343
Walt Disney didn't have
himself cryonized, but yes.

15:36.358 --> 15:37.372
So what is it?

15:37.398 --> 15:39.364
Basically, after you die,

15:39.376 --> 15:42.055
your body gets put
into a capsule with um,

15:42.067 --> 15:43.405
liquid nitrogen?
Am I right?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.098
In hopes that someday,
medicine might be able to

15:47.111 --> 15:48.400
cure whatever disease you have

15:48.412 --> 15:50.344
or just to live longer.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.357
Wait, you're not thinking about

15:52.368 --> 15:54.372
freezing yourself, are you?

15:55.961 --> 15:57.360
Let me show you something.

16:08.038 --> 16:12.890
<i>You say you're going away
I didn't know</i>

16:13.072 --> 16:14.394
You want me to help you?

16:17.125 --> 16:20.187
Ah, this article is...

16:21.140 --> 16:22.341
Seven years old now.

16:23.252 --> 16:25.352
They extracted the heart
matrix out of a dead rat

16:25.364 --> 16:27.363
and inject its stem cells into it.

16:27.475 --> 16:29.400
A few days later,
the heart started beating.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.386
And this is just the beginning.

16:31.398 --> 16:32.409
I mean, since then, they've even

16:32.421 --> 16:34.402
managed to fabricate
simple human organs.

16:34.414 --> 16:37.398
They've even transplanted
some of them successfully.

16:37.421 --> 16:39.376
There's a revolution coming.

16:39.489 --> 16:41.385
At some point in the
not-so-distant future,

16:41.397 --> 16:42.399
they'll be able to manufacture

16:42.411 --> 16:45.358
organs specifically created
to suit each patient.

16:45.402 --> 16:47.058
I mean, imagine, I could just

16:47.070 --> 16:50.327
simply replace my pharynx
with a new one.

16:51.701 --> 16:53.006
That's that.

16:53.707 --> 16:55.258
I could keep on living.

16:56.989 --> 16:58.402
Are you serious?

16:59.128 --> 17:00.289
I am.

17:02.107 --> 17:04.006
But for that to happen,

17:04.018 --> 17:06.300
first they'd have to bring
you back to life, right?

17:06.335 --> 17:08.387
That part doesn't seem
so difficult to me.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.398
They've already reanimated insects

17:10.411 --> 17:13.386
and small animals trapped in
ice for who knows how long.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.642
And babies conceived with
frozen sperm and eggs

17:16.654 --> 17:18.474
are alive when they're born, right?

17:19.005 --> 17:21.384
How do you know they'll
keep their end of the deal?

17:21.397 --> 17:23.119
I mean the people you
signed the contract with

17:23.132 --> 17:25.390
won't be around
to take responsibility.

17:25.499 --> 17:28.382
I guess I'll have to trust humanity.

17:33.606 --> 17:34.779
<i>You know...</i>

17:35.002 --> 17:37.127
it sounds good to me.

17:37.688 --> 17:39.979
I mean after all,
we are talking about

17:39.991 --> 17:42.382
what they'll do with your
body after we die, right?

17:42.405 --> 17:43.401
Yeah.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.410
Yeah. Yeah, it might not be
such a bad idea.

17:46.001 --> 17:47.003
Let's have a toast.

17:47.510 --> 17:48.698
To cryonization.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.554
- And to the future.
- Sure, what the hell.

17:53.754 --> 17:54.999
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

17:56.123 --> 17:57.160
We love you, Marc.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.277
You know, I bet the
future's gonna be full of

18:04.289 --> 18:06.372
- hot chicks.
- And super horny!

18:06.388 --> 18:07.399
An improvement on the present.

18:08.239 --> 18:10.002
- And men would be sensitive.
- Oh, come on.

18:10.278 --> 18:12.386
Yeah, but we'll be old
and wrinkled by then.

18:13.786 --> 18:14.796
Not me.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.007
I'm gonna fuck all
your grandchildren.

18:20.001 --> 18:22.391
- Calcium channels?
<i>- All clear.</i>

18:22.402 --> 18:23.411
<i>Sodium's at 110.</i>

18:24.322 --> 18:26.377
We need to bring it down.
Invert sodium/potassium pump.

18:26.992 --> 18:28.394
<i>Inversion initiated.</i>

18:28.641 --> 18:30.400
Temperature variation?

18:30.500 --> 18:31.390
<i>Two decimals.</i>

18:31.411 --> 18:32.396
Thanks, Elizabeth.

18:32.784 --> 18:34.396
<i>Exocellular potassium rising.</i>

18:34.408 --> 18:36.377
Okay, time remaining in spine?

18:36.489 --> 18:37.360
<i>Four minutes.</i>

18:37.482 --> 18:39.381
Arm 6, confirm closure.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.379
<i>Confirmed.</i>

18:40.491 --> 18:42.326
Arm 2, I need you out.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.326
<i>Copy that. Moving.</i>

18:44.438 --> 18:46.352
Mitochondrial RNA levels?

18:46.364 --> 18:47.374
<i>90 percent.</i>

18:48.006 --> 18:49.363
Muscular insertions?

18:49.392 --> 18:50.373
<i>Completed.</i>

18:51.057 --> 18:53.888
Activate neuromuscular connections, now.

18:54.056 --> 18:55.097
<i>Activating.</i>

18:58.087 --> 18:59.411
<i>Arm 5 to enter pericardium.</i>

18:59.680 --> 19:02.484
Go ahead. Arm 3, I need you
to change access with Arm 5.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.349
<i>Copy. Initiating movement.</i>

19:04.610 --> 19:07.298
- Sodium levels?
<i>- 109.</i>

19:07.412 --> 19:08.376
Still too high.

19:09.556 --> 19:11.068
<i>Introducing hypotonic solution.</i>

19:11.120 --> 19:13.472
- Temperature?
<i>- 73 fahrenheit.</i>

19:13.961 --> 19:16.381
Troponin under 001, good job.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.299
What are you looking at?

19:34.999 --> 19:36.187
What do you think?

19:40.006 --> 19:42.375
Look man, the truth is,
I still don't trust it.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.206
All the websites I've seen

19:44.218 --> 19:46.322
look like they belong
to a cult or something.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.298
There's no guarantee.

19:48.412 --> 19:49.509
Did you know that in 1979,

19:49.520 --> 19:52.188
they found the bodies of nine
people that have been cryonized?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.388
In a cemetery,
here in California...

19:54.400 --> 19:56.388
Thawed, 'cause the company
was cutting costs.

19:56.521 --> 19:58.386
You guys are all over me tonight.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.375
Yeah. And people who
cryonize themselves

20:00.387 --> 20:03.344
trust that the 40 or 50 grand
they set aside will be enough

20:03.356 --> 20:05.381
to pay for reviving
them and all the rest.

20:05.393 --> 20:09.379
You see my dad's pension's almost
gone since the last crisis.

20:09.391 --> 20:12.346
I know. And I agree.
There were problems at first.

20:12.358 --> 20:14.383
But cryonization's gone
mainstream since then.

20:14.383 --> 20:16.383
I mean, now it depends on
how well prepared you are.

20:16.396 --> 20:18.349
For example, the money question,

20:18.361 --> 20:20.376
I'm gonna set aside a lot more.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.304
I'm gonna set all
of my money aside.

20:22.316 --> 20:24.776
Why do you think that
anybody from the future

20:24.779 --> 20:26.212
would want to bring
you back to life?

20:26.224 --> 20:27.545
Or anybody else for that matter?

20:27.557 --> 20:29.350
The world is gonna be
totally overpopulated.

20:29.366 --> 20:32.237
You'll be like a man
from the 19th century.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.249
I mean, what's the point of that?

20:33.341 --> 20:35.317
Unless they wanna use you as
guinea pigs for science.

20:37.254 --> 20:39.382
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.001
No.

20:41.013 --> 20:42.202
No, it's okay.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.370
I wanted to talk to
you two about it.

20:51.028 --> 20:52.856
Okay.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.319
Then I have question.

20:55.529 --> 20:56.319
Shoot.

20:59.406 --> 21:00.319
So...

21:00.851 --> 21:02.327
Everywhere I look,
they say the body needs

21:02.339 --> 21:04.346
to be cryonized as soon as possible

21:04.358 --> 21:06.348
after you're declared legally dead.

21:06.822 --> 21:08.355
So your cells don't deteriorate.

21:08.827 --> 21:10.134
But no matter what they did,

21:10.346 --> 21:11.372
it would take several hours.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.850
Even a day or more to
complete the process.

21:14.060 --> 21:15.550
The damage will be huge.

21:16.262 --> 21:17.300
Not to mention the harm caused

21:17.361 --> 21:20.330
by the disease and the
treatment before you die.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.540
Yeah.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.384
I'm not doing any more chemo.

21:27.163 --> 21:29.032
I already saw my father

21:29.204 --> 21:30.145
spend years of his life 

21:30.267 --> 21:31.307
fighting his disease. 

21:31.399 --> 21:33.348
Dying little by little.

21:33.429 --> 21:34.337
I won't go through that.

21:37.146 --> 21:38.360
And as far as the time

21:38.372 --> 21:40.374
between death and cryonization...

21:42.048 --> 21:43.368
Well, I have a plan to make sure

21:43.380 --> 21:44.386
that they get to me quickly

21:44.398 --> 21:46.374
and start pumping blood right away.

21:48.152 --> 21:50.367
How... How will you do that?

21:51.099 --> 21:52.376
I mean you would have to know

21:52.389 --> 21:54.362
the exact circumstances of your death.

21:56.342 --> 21:57.338
Yeah.

21:58.124 --> 22:00.225
Um, I'm gonna make sure

22:00.338 --> 22:01.350
they're waiting close by

22:01.363 --> 22:04.381
and that I'm in good physical
shape when the time comes.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.372
I gotta die before the
disease gets a hold of me.

22:15.308 --> 22:16.329
And I need your help.

22:19.008 --> 22:22.372
I need somebody close by.

22:25.951 --> 22:27.327
When I do it.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.356
Hi Marc!

23:31.850 --> 23:33.361
- Hi, Marc.
- How do you feel, Marc?

23:36.300 --> 23:37.344
Great to see you.

23:38.822 --> 23:40.344
Welcome back to life, Marc.

23:45.459 --> 23:46.368
<i>Heartrate, 190.</i>

23:46.368 --> 23:47.371
<i>Blood pressure rising.</i>

23:53.331 --> 23:54.324
It's okay, Marc, we're here.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.340
I'm here.

24:17.010 --> 24:18.326
Can you see yourself?

24:21.101 --> 24:23.342
Don't worry, you'll look a lot
better when your hair grows back.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.351
Try to tell us how you feel.

24:30.752 --> 24:32.307
Can your feel your whole body?

24:35.009 --> 24:36.307
It hurts.

24:37.403 --> 24:38.308
What hurts?

24:40.217 --> 24:41.306
Everything.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.312
That's a good sign, Marc.

24:43.902 --> 24:44.970
I'm Dr. West.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.326
The pain will go away
little by little.

24:47.380 --> 24:50.355
You have to go easy
on the painkillers.

24:50.801 --> 24:53.052
Now, tell me if you feel this.

24:57.002 --> 24:59.318
I don't know where it is.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.324
You don't know where I'm touching you?

25:02.041 --> 25:05.324
My arm. I don't know where it is.

25:06.008 --> 25:08.319
Is it the same with your legs?

25:11.100 --> 25:13.308
Don't worry about that right now.

25:13.321 --> 25:14.320
We'll try to fix it.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.324
Tell me, Marc, can you remember?
Do you remember your life?

25:21.396 --> 25:22.311
Yeah.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.312
What about after that?

25:26.509 --> 25:28.300
The years up until now?

25:29.140 --> 25:31.300
Do you remember anything
about the other side?

25:37.209 --> 25:38.287
Nothing?

25:44.375 --> 25:45.308
Fear.

25:48.328 --> 25:49.310
Dying.

25:54.326 --> 25:55.312
Waking up.

25:55.488 --> 25:58.381
Okay, Marc, you don't say anymore.

25:58.396 --> 26:01.000
We know this is
incredibly hard for you.

26:15.505 --> 26:17.280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the future,</i>

26:17.294 --> 26:19.300
<i>it's time to introduce myself.</i>

26:20.095 --> 26:22.312
<i>I'll use the same words as Dr. West.</i>

26:22.901 --> 26:24.312
<i>My name is Marc Jarvis,</i>

26:24.326 --> 26:27.324
<i>And I am the first man
ever to be resurrected.</i>

26:28.008 --> 26:30.324
<i>To summarize, this is what I am.</i>

26:30.346 --> 26:33.317
20 percent remains of
<i>vital organs and tissue</i>

26:33.331 --> 26:35.301
<i>recovered from my old body.</i>

26:35.315 --> 26:36.340
<i>Mainly the brain</i>

26:36.354 --> 26:38.315
<i>and the rest of the
central nervous system.</i>

26:38.330 --> 26:40.303
<i>65 percent cloned bones</i>

26:40.317 --> 26:44.303
<i>muscle, skin, nerve endings,
and other organ remains.</i>

26:44.318 --> 26:46.311
<i>10 percent bionic implants</i>

26:46.325 --> 26:50.380
<i>to reinforce the muscular,
skeletal system and sensory organs.</i>

26:50.395 --> 26:52.222
<i>And 5 percent internal technology</i>

26:52.236 --> 26:54.222
<i>designed to regulate and monitor</i>

26:54.236 --> 26:57.051
<i>the correct functioning of the organism.</i>

26:57.069 --> 27:00.251
<i>On top of that, add a system
of external connection.</i>

27:00.251 --> 27:02.263
<i>A detachable umbilical cord.</i>

27:02.278 --> 27:05.115
<i>A nearly constant means
of connecting me to my</i>

27:05.130 --> 27:06.326
<i>new mechanical mother.</i>

27:09.123 --> 27:11.342
<i>Dr. West and his team
have had to face</i>

27:11.356 --> 27:14.324
<i>innumerable problems
since my reanimation.</i>

27:14.339 --> 27:16.333
<i>and their respective
solutions have been</i>

27:17.501 --> 27:19.212
<i>insufferable.</i>

27:19.396 --> 27:21.325
<i>More surgery.</i>

27:21.356 --> 27:22.325
<i>Organ removal.</i>

27:23.016 --> 27:24.340
<i>Induced coma.</i>

27:24.355 --> 27:26.336
<i>External control of vital signs.</i>

27:26.351 --> 27:29.322
<i>The administering of drugs
to prevent adverse reaction.</i>

27:29.337 --> 27:33.309
<i>More drugs to ease the
effects of those drugs.</i>

27:33.324 --> 27:37.318
<i>And so on, and so on, and so on.</i>

27:37.388 --> 27:41.325
<i>All this resulting in a
terribly fragile organism.</i>

27:41.340 --> 27:44.352
<i>Permanently on the edge of collapse.</i>

27:46.602 --> 27:48.352
<i>The Laboratory Man.</i>

27:49.280 --> 27:51.361
<i>Frankenstein's monster.</i>

27:54.376 --> 27:56.203
- Very good, Marc.
- Well done!

27:58.349 --> 27:59.358
It's amazing.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.396
<i>But there is another
way to look at it.</i>

28:11.358 --> 28:12.729
<i>I was going to die.</i>

28:14.759 --> 28:16.335
<i>I was going to disappear.</i>

28:18.388 --> 28:19.635
<i>Forever.</i>

28:20.835 --> 28:22.406
<i>And I'm alive again.</i>

28:25.410 --> 28:26.397
<i>I'm alive.</i>

28:31.417 --> 28:32.386
<i>I'm alive.</i>

28:34.014 --> 28:35.374
- You're doing great, Marc.
- Good.

28:36.574 --> 28:40.346
- No rush, small steps.
- You're doing great

29:02.425 --> 29:06.153
You're going to sleep well now, Marc.
Get some rest.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.351
You can rest now.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.342
Goodnight, Marc.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.362
Okay, now let's try
one finger at a time.

29:49.328 --> 29:50.297
Hmm.

29:51.688 --> 29:54.306
- It's difficult.
- Little by little.

30:02.106 --> 30:04.322
What's it like?

30:06.127 --> 30:07.311
The world out there?

30:08.108 --> 30:09.320
What would you like to know?

30:10.320 --> 30:11.334
I don't know.

30:12.470 --> 30:15.360
Are there spaceships?
People living on Mars?

30:17.195 --> 30:19.372
You know, things haven't
changed so much.

30:19.487 --> 30:22.184
If you went outside,
you'd see a lot of buildings

30:22.199 --> 30:23.360
from your time still standing.

30:24.061 --> 30:26.348
And although we barely use oil now,

30:26.363 --> 30:30.360
Cars still have wheels and
airplanes still have wings.

30:30.375 --> 30:31.233
Let's try it with the other hand.

30:33.650 --> 30:36.014
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.327
How are you feeling, Marc?

30:39.402 --> 30:40.329
Good. Thank you.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.334
Actually, Marc, there is something
you've never seen before.

30:43.370 --> 30:46.316
Technology's biggest
revolution since computers.

30:46.330 --> 30:48.340
We call it MW or
Mind Writer.

30:48.355 --> 30:49.332
If you connect it to your head,

30:49.347 --> 30:51.292
it can extract images and sounds.

30:51.452 --> 30:54.319
With concentration and practice,
you can record your thoughts.

30:54.396 --> 30:57.320
Nowadays, MW is used for everything.

30:58.487 --> 31:00.336
This is where the
information is recorded.

31:00.351 --> 31:02.010
Then later, it is
used to substantiate

31:02.025 --> 31:03.314
anything that has occurred,

31:03.329 --> 31:05.325
or to present
reports and projects.

31:05.339 --> 31:08.341
Or to simply share experiences
and connect with people.

31:08.357 --> 31:10.319
Or see what they're
doing behind your back.

31:10.401 --> 31:11.998
It's also used to create art.

31:12.112 --> 31:14.387
You were an artist, weren't you?

31:14.485 --> 31:15.421
Yes.

31:15.550 --> 31:16.585
Apart from anything else,

31:16.600 --> 31:18.330
it would help us to
get to know you better.

31:18.746 --> 31:19.736
And not only us,

31:19.751 --> 31:22.981
very soon, many people will want
to know first-hand, how you feel.

31:23.777 --> 31:25.981
We want you to have something ready

31:26.000 --> 31:27.420
when we present you to society

31:27.438 --> 31:29.384
to the media and to our investors.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.376
The media?

31:31.392 --> 31:34.376
A lot of people have paid
good money for your resurrection.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.360
It's important that the
world meets you, Marc.

31:37.010 --> 31:39.222
Of course.

31:39.345 --> 31:41.323
Would you like to give it a try?

31:41.338 --> 31:43.334
I'll put it on you
for a few seconds.

31:58.000 --> 31:58.958
Are you okay?

31:59.020 --> 32:01.328
I admit, the first time
can be a little intense.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.328
You have to concentrate
on the images and sounds

32:04.343 --> 32:06.345
to make them come into focus.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.350
Like in the movies
you used to watch.

32:08.399 --> 32:10.360
I'm gonna leave you. Try not to 
overstimulate our patient.

32:10.374 --> 32:12.355
He's had enough excitement
for one day, okay?

32:13.005 --> 32:14.327
I'm going back to my office.

32:15.019 --> 32:16.330
In my spaceship.

32:18.401 --> 32:19.330
Wanna try it again?

32:20.402 --> 32:21.340
Put it on yourself.

33:11.401 --> 33:12.338
What are you do--

33:35.221 --> 33:37.510
Marc! Marc! Marc! Marc! 

33:47.410 --> 33:48.320
Yeah, suck on that!

33:53.080 --> 33:56.317
Am I all the things
I'm seeing and feeling?

34:00.019 --> 34:02.326
If I manage to record my memories

34:04.002 --> 34:05.335
Will they still belong to me?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.329
That's the first thing I thought
when I put on Mind Writer.

34:13.108 --> 34:16.328
I just hope I get the hang of it
before you see this recording.

34:31.014 --> 34:32.297
in sign language

34:55.221 --> 34:56.289
You're very pretty.

34:57.501 --> 34:58.401
Thanks.

34:58.528 --> 35:00.401
But nothing special.
508
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,320
Nowadays we have it
easier than you did.

35:05.150 --> 35:08.411
We can choose our
children's features and

35:08.630 --> 35:10.308
microsurgery does the rest.

35:12.807 --> 35:15.325
No wonder people were
so ugly a century ago.

35:16.402 --> 35:17.314
Thanks.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.306
What about your teeth?

35:20.410 --> 35:21.322
What about my teeth?

35:22.340 --> 35:23.365
Is it intentional?

35:23.380 --> 35:24.344
Of course, it is.

35:25.095 --> 35:26.201
Why, you don't like them?

35:26.216 --> 35:28.228
No, I like them.

35:32.105 --> 35:33.210
How old are you?

35:34.302 --> 35:35.210
46.

35:35.510 --> 35:37.402
46?

35:39.116 --> 35:40.235
Ooh...

35:41.850 --> 35:43.320
You got a boyfriend?

35:45.320 --> 35:48.400
I think our notion of couples

35:48.415 --> 35:50.441
is not as defined as it
was back in your time.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.341
What do you mean?

35:53.225 --> 35:55.364
Well, let's just say that

35:55.375 --> 35:58.878
romantic love has come under
a lot more scrutiny.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.287
You were truly slaves
to it back then.

36:01.584 --> 36:03.259
We don't suppress much
of our love anymore.

36:04.071 --> 36:05.042
Does that hurt?

36:05.140 --> 36:06.298
No.

36:06.550 --> 36:08.259
So what do you do in your spare time?

36:09.200 --> 36:11.260
You're talkative today.

36:11.275 --> 36:17.240
Um, well, since I started
working here, not very much, um

36:18.021 --> 36:21.250
I'm a big fan of Mind Writer,
almost an addict.

36:22.022 --> 36:25.310
I watch series, I have dinner
with my parents.

36:25.325 --> 36:27.340
I meet with my sex group.

36:27.355 --> 36:28.348
Sex group?

36:28.880 --> 36:30.352
I'm lucky, it's very complete.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.340
and I've got good friends there.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.350
Whoa...

36:35.370 --> 36:37.369
It's the world I always dreamed of.

36:39.011 --> 36:40.370
I like you.

36:40.995 --> 36:43.354
If you want, we can
have sex some time.

36:45.621 --> 36:46.353
Well, later on, of course.

36:46.950 --> 36:48.356
When your body feels strong enough.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.556
Later on.
Of course.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.351
<i>Life.</i>

38:35.420 --> 38:37.352
<i>What can we expect from it?</i>

38:39.022 --> 38:40.324
<i>A body.</i>

38:41.010 --> 38:42.301
<i>A working body.</i>

38:42.316 --> 38:45.400
<i>That tightens and relaxes naturally.</i>

38:46.001 --> 38:47.357
<i>That moves.</i>

38:49.017 --> 38:51.328
<i>A heart that vibrates.</i>

38:51.353 --> 38:53.342
<i>Elastic and strong.</i>

38:54.602 --> 38:56.330
<i>Ready to feel.</i>

38:59.334 --> 39:00.352
Hey, Marc!

39:00.370 --> 39:02.341
Here comes Rebecca.

39:07.368 --> 39:08.350
Hi, Marc.

39:08.373 --> 39:10.342
Wanna go to the
school dance with me?

39:17.329 --> 39:19.038
Hey, hey, what about us?

39:19.510 --> 39:21.336
Yeah, don't forget to invite
us to the wedding.

39:22.025 --> 39:23.336
Na na, na na, na na...

39:24.002 --> 39:26.509
Na na, na na, na na...

39:26.859 --> 39:28.402
Make sure to get this
flower for you, Marc.

39:35.330 --> 39:36.327
<i>Life.</i>

39:37.086 --> 39:39.331
<i>What do we expect from it?</i>

39:41.410 --> 39:43.325
<i>Certainly not this fragility.</i>

39:44.304 --> 39:46.330
<i>This half speed existence.</i>

39:48.980 --> 39:51.020
<i>We definitely don't
expect a medical history</i>

39:51.038 --> 39:54.322
<i>full of afflictions and minor defects.</i>

39:56.002 --> 39:57.340
<i>A propensity for thrombosis.</i>

39:58.029 --> 40:00.335
<i>Numbness in the extremities.</i>

40:01.435 --> 40:03.352
<i>Involuntary movements.</i>

40:03.909 --> 40:05.341
<i>Loss of equilibrium.</i>

40:05.981 --> 40:07.343
<i>Scaling of the skin.</i>

40:08.001 --> 40:10.350
<i>Irritation of conjunctive tissue.</i>

40:11.009 --> 40:13.339
<i>Respiratory insufficiency.</i>

40:13.959 --> 40:15.348
<i>Cardiac insufficiency.</i>

40:17.041 --> 40:18.350
<i>Incontinence.</i>

40:19.104 --> 40:20.250
<i>Impotence.</i>

40:24.500 --> 40:28.250
<i>You don't expect so many
limitations so soon.</i>

40:29.653 --> 40:32.129
<i>You never expect
this invincible fatigue</i>

40:32.142 --> 40:35.342
<i>which eventually becomes like a fog.</i>

40:36.002 --> 40:37.531
<i>Covering everything.</i>

40:37.562 --> 40:38.688
Marc. Stay with me, stay with me.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.445
<i>Threatening to turn off any light.</i>

40:41.466 --> 40:43.336
- Everything's going to be fine.
- <i>Any sound.</i>

40:45.017 --> 40:46.345
<i>...so let me get this straight,</i>

40:47.234 --> 40:49.329
<i>if this is your exhibition,</i>

40:49.343 --> 40:50.338
<i>does that make you
the exhibitionist, or what?</i>

40:50.352 --> 40:52.329
<i>you might get
in trouble for that.</i>

41:02.018 --> 41:06.338
<i>And if deterioration,
fatigue and despair do arrive,</i>

41:07.012 --> 41:09.342
<i>you at least expect
to keep your memories.</i>

41:11.014 --> 41:12.305
You guys, there it is!

41:13.200 --> 41:14.310
You see it?

41:17.311 --> 41:18.324
Oh, there it is.

41:21.386 --> 41:22.322
<i>Marc Jarvis.</i>

41:30.335 --> 41:31.317
<i>Mr. Jarvis.</i>

41:31.317 --> 41:34.326
<i>What if your memories
were erased as well?</i>

41:40.556 --> 41:43.340
<i>What will become of me
now that my memories are fading?</i>

41:49.518 --> 41:51.338
Neurocircuits are functioning
even better that we anticipated.

41:51.570 --> 41:55.400
But there is something happening
in certain cells in this area here.

41:55.601 --> 41:58.328
Now, we don't know why yet,
but they're deteriorating.

41:58.570 --> 42:01.337
It's what caused the apoplexy and
it's what's causing the memory loss.

42:02.237 --> 42:04.337
It's very difficult to
crack the problem, Marc.

42:04.630 --> 42:06.021
We don't expect greater consequences,

42:06.121 --> 42:08.324
but as far as your memory's concerned,

42:09.004 --> 42:11.318
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.

42:13.017 --> 42:14.357
I don't mean to trivialize this, but

42:14.373 --> 42:17.288
nowadays, memory loss is not
considered a serious problem.

42:17.302 --> 42:20.116
Mind Writer allows us to recover
memory with a 100 percent accuracy.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.307
In fact, millions of people
all over the world

42:22.322 --> 42:25.325
lead completely normal lives without
actually remembering anything.

42:31.005 --> 42:33.334
Could I speak to you
for a moment alone?

42:33.530 --> 42:34.524
Sure.

42:41.084 --> 42:43.337
Tell me Marc, what can I do for you?

42:44.350 --> 42:45.346
Nothing.

42:46.126 --> 42:48.302
I just wanted to have a little chat.

42:50.002 --> 42:52.319
I haven't thanked you for
everything you've done for me.

42:52.828 --> 42:54.325
You've nothing to thank me for.

42:58.322 --> 42:59.318
Your family?

43:01.005 --> 43:03.396
My kids and um...

43:04.000 --> 43:05.336
My ex-partner.

43:08.011 --> 43:09.352
I'd like to know...

43:09.950 --> 43:12.340
what you think of my
progress as a patient.

43:13.890 --> 43:16.367
I wonder what will
happen from now on.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.338
If I'll ever move by myself.

43:21.975 --> 43:24.329
If the complications will go away.

43:25.551 --> 43:28.324
If I'll ever be normal.

43:29.027 --> 43:32.338
I'm afraid, you'll never be
completely autonomous, Marc.

43:32.354 --> 43:35.338
That machine keeps you alive.
It takes care of you.

43:36.538 --> 43:39.326
But you will be able to
disconnect yourself from it

43:39.341 --> 43:40.392
for greater periods of time.

43:42.015 --> 43:44.347
You'll never move at the
speed and accuracy of a teenager.

43:44.428 --> 43:47.372
And I can't promise you that
new complications won't arise.

43:48.102 --> 43:49.336
But with luck,

43:49.372 --> 43:51.336
they won't be any more serious

43:51.351 --> 43:54.324
than those experienced by
patients with chronic diseases

43:54.339 --> 43:55.348
or by the elderly.

43:57.898 --> 43:59.351
The elderly?

44:00.914 --> 44:01.942
<i>Marc...</i>

44:03.042 --> 44:04.342
<i>I understand your fear.</i>

44:04.357 --> 44:06.330
<i>But I have to ask
you to be strong</i>

44:06.342 --> 44:07.356
<i>and not to let it get
the better of you.</i>

44:08.010 --> 44:10.348
And don't you forget,
we're all here to support you.

44:10.363 --> 44:11.359
That you're not alone.

44:14.122 --> 44:17.356
Don't you realize the
importance of our achievement?

44:18.108 --> 44:21.360
It's a giant step in
the history of medicine.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.353
You're that giant step, Marc.

44:27.142 --> 44:29.339
You'd better prepare yourself.

44:30.023 --> 44:32.370
You're gonna be the most
famous person on the planet.

44:42.001 --> 44:45.324
<i>I don't know if any of you,
maybe some of the oldest,</i>

44:45.339 --> 44:48.338
<i>have seen any films
about Jesus Christ.</i>

44:52.007 --> 44:55.338
<i>I remember being struck once
by Lazarus' attitude in the</i>

44:55.353 --> 44:59.338
<i>first moments after he was
revived by the Messiah.</i>

45:01.008 --> 45:03.346
<i>He looked deeply confused.</i>

45:05.006 --> 45:07.254
<i>Like he knew he
was morally corrupt.</i>

45:09.004 --> 45:12.354
<i>As if he hated Jesus for
bringing him back to life.</i>

45:55.002 --> 45:59.348
We'll be able to go for
walks outside soon, okay?

46:00.000 --> 46:01.135
Short ones.

46:03.005 --> 46:06.386
So your new lungs can start
adapting to the air of our time.

46:31.635 --> 46:33.400
- Whoa.
- Congratulations.

46:33.521 --> 46:36.385
For he's a jolly good fellow,

46:36.901 --> 46:39.368
For he's a jolly good fellow,

46:39.868 --> 46:43.667
For he's a jolly good fellow,

46:44.056 --> 46:48.375
Which nobody can deny.

46:49.162 --> 46:51.344
100 days old.
Congratulations, Marc.

46:52.144 --> 46:53.360
Can I eat sugar now?

46:53.375 --> 46:55.371
Don't get your hopes up,
it's a special cake.

46:58.300 --> 46:59.329
Mmm. 

47:00.288 --> 47:01.338
Thank you all.

47:05.330 --> 47:06.342
Sit down, Marc.

47:16.324 --> 47:17.368
Do you remember it?

47:18.342 --> 47:19.357
Yeah.

47:44.522 --> 47:46.320
What in the world is this?

47:46.950 --> 47:47.884
My work.

47:48.343 --> 47:49.462
And photographs.

47:51.380 --> 47:53.328
Photographs of my life.

47:53.508 --> 47:55.688
We'll have them scanned so you
can see them on your screen.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.318
Hmm.

48:58.007 --> 48:59.347
<i>Let me tell you the story</i>

48:59.362 --> 49:01.350
<i>of two lovers who
were never in sync.</i>

49:03.050 --> 49:05.349
<i>The lovers without a time.</i>

49:06.131 --> 49:07.352
<i>They meet in college.</i>

49:07.388 --> 49:10.338
<i>They're the coolest,
the best looking.</i>

49:10.638 --> 49:12.326
<i>A walking pile of hormones.</i>

49:14.026 --> 49:16.336
<i>The machinery is set in motion.</i>

49:17.026 --> 49:18.329
<i>The course of their lives</i>

49:18.344 --> 49:20.360
<i>will never be the same again.</i>

49:21.860 --> 49:23.360
<i>But the timing isn't right for her</i>

49:23.375 --> 49:24.372
<i>because she has a boyfriend</i>

49:24.386 --> 49:26.338
<i>that she doesn't want or perhaps</i>

49:26.353 --> 49:28.351
<i>doesn't know how to break up with.</i>

49:30.006 --> 49:32.350
<i>Yet still, behind her boyfriend's back,</i>

49:32.364 --> 49:33.321
<i>she fools around with him</i>

49:33.336 --> 49:35.301
<i>over the course of several years.</i>

49:36.301 --> 49:38.622
<i>Until she realizes
she's in love with him.</i>

49:39.002 --> 49:41.302
<i>And only him.</i>

49:42.022 --> 49:44.325
<i>But now, the timing isn't right for him.</i>

49:46.005 --> 49:47.336
<i>He got tired of waiting for her.</i>

49:47.352 --> 49:49.336
<i>And has overcome his teenage shyness.</i>

49:51.006 --> 49:53.422
<i>He's in his prime.</i>

49:53.438 --> 49:55.333
<i>Meeting tons of girls and getting laid.</i>

49:56.300 --> 49:57.344
<i>All the time.</i>

49:59.091 --> 50:00.351
<i>She suffers for several years as</i>

50:00.366 --> 50:03.348
<i>they continue seeing each other as friends</i>

50:03.352 --> 50:04.398
<i>and occasional lovers.</i>

50:06.009 --> 50:09.330
<i>Meanwhile, he grows tired of his wild ways</i>

50:09.345 --> 50:10.370
<i>and realizes that what</i>

50:10.385 --> 50:12.380
<i>he really wants is to be with her.</i>

50:12.900 --> 50:14.390
<i>And her alone.</i>

50:16.020 --> 50:18.390
<i>But once again, the timing isn't right.</i>

50:18.403 --> 50:22.340
<i>Because she's tired of being
emotionally dependent on people.</i>

50:22.355 --> 50:26.340
<i>And has discovered her freedom
and the pleasures of being promiscuous.</i>

50:27.050 --> 50:29.338
<i>She feels young again.</i>

50:29.353 --> 50:30.388
<i>Meeting tons of guys.</i>

50:30.888 --> 50:33.340
<i>And getting laid all the time.</i>

50:36.008 --> 50:37.336
<i>He suffers for several years</i>

50:37.351 --> 50:40.351
<i>as they continue seeing each other as friends</i>

50:40.365 --> 50:41.410
<i>and occasional lovers.</i>

50:43.111 --> 50:45.350
<i>And now, it might be sheer habit.</i>

50:45.980 --> 50:49.350
<i>But they're seeing each
other more and more.</i>

50:49.990 --> 50:51.360
<i>And his hair starts falling out</i>

50:51.375 --> 50:54.320
<i>and her biological clock
kicks into action.</i>

50:57.020 --> 50:59.000
<i>Only for now, still...</i>

50:59.177 --> 51:00.398
<i>Their luck is out.</i>

51:01.008 --> 51:03.348
<i>'Cause he's just been diagnosed with cancer</i>

51:03.363 --> 51:05.370
<i>and is going to die.</i>

51:06.220 --> 51:08.360
<i>She confesses her love and tells him</i>

51:08.375 --> 51:10.355
<i>she'll break it off with her current fling</i>

51:10.370 --> 51:13.344
<i>and take a leave of absence from her job.</i>

51:14.004 --> 51:16.365
<i>Because she wants this last year of his life,</i>

51:17.565 --> 51:19.349
<i>this last year together</i>

51:19.365 --> 51:22.348
<i>to finally be their moment as lovers.</i>

51:24.008 --> 51:26.352
<i>But now isn't the right time either.</i>

51:27.002 --> 51:30.325
<i>Because he's decided to
have his body cryonized.</i>

51:30.901 --> 51:34.352
<i>And needs to commit suicide
before the disease destroys his body.</i>

51:57.360 --> 51:58.370
<i>Dear Marc,</i>

51:59.009 --> 52:01.368
<i>I've written this letter a thousand times.</i>

52:02.008 --> 52:03.342
<i>I've tried to fill you in on what</i>

52:03.357 --> 52:05.358
<i>happened throughout the years
to the people you loved.</i>

52:06.000 --> 52:10.362
<i>But it seems unfair to 
summarize their lives in a few lines.</i>

52:11.462 --> 52:13.356
Do you want me to read it for you?

52:27.014 --> 52:29.348
<i>Anyway, I'm not writing
to tell you about them</i>

52:29.448 --> 52:32.336
<i>but because death is at my doorstep.</i>

52:33.006 --> 52:35.336
<i>The news has come when I'm 50</i>

52:35.420 --> 52:38.370
<i>And although I've conceded to
enjoy what little time I have left,</i>

52:39.000 --> 52:41.362
<i>I'm having myself cryonized, too.</i>

52:44.002 --> 52:46.188
<i>Why? I miss you.</i>

52:46.288 --> 52:48.358
<i>That's the simplest
explanation I can give.</i>

52:48.968 --> 52:52.356
<i>I never loved anyone
like I loved you.</i>

52:52.976 --> 52:54.236
<i>I'd like to see you again</i>

52:54.251 --> 52:56.336
<i>and hold your hand.</i>

52:56.786 --> 52:58.286
<i>And if they can bring us back to life,</i>

52:58.301 --> 53:01.362
<i>surely, they can make me look
young and beautiful again, right?</i>

53:02.008 --> 53:04.356
<i>I'll only be a little bit wiser.</i>

53:06.002 --> 53:07.000
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

53:07.015 --> 53:08.017
<i>See you soon,</i>

53:08.117 --> 53:09.356
<i>Naomi.</i>

53:22.879 --> 53:23.862
Never.

53:25.005 --> 53:26.250
We'll see about that!

53:26.670 --> 53:27.650
Never!

53:29.350 --> 53:30.305
Hey!

53:30.396 --> 53:31.378
Hey!

53:33.334 --> 53:34.301
Naomi!

53:34.361 --> 53:35.348
Never!

53:36.344 --> 53:37.336
I got a cramp!

53:40.339 --> 53:41.346
What?

53:41.388 --> 53:43.302
What... Oh, my God!

53:45.310 --> 53:46.302
Not in the water!

53:47.302 --> 53:48.294
Stop it!

53:48.368 --> 53:49.356
Stop it!

53:49.986 --> 53:51.002
Not in the water, no!

54:10.002 --> 54:13.048
A large part of the success of your
reanimation was due to the fact

54:13.174 --> 54:16.360
that you interrupted your life while
still in very good physical shape.

54:16.460 --> 54:18.260
That's why you were selected.

54:20.540 --> 54:21.340
There they are.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.340
You spent a while here too, you know.

54:27.110 --> 54:28.422
What will happen to them?

54:30.082 --> 54:31.348
Well, it's hard to say.

54:32.012 --> 54:34.372
Apart from the medical risks
involved in each individual case,

54:34.402 --> 54:39.295
the time and resources required for
reanimation are still quite high.

54:39.321 --> 54:41.125
Consider that we'd have to create

54:41.140 --> 54:43.360
organs and specific technology
for each one of them.

54:43.486 --> 54:45.341
Like we did with you.

54:45.727 --> 54:48.341
And an enormous team of humans
would have to be mobilized.

54:50.001 --> 54:53.152
Then most of these people
will never be reanimated?

54:54.072 --> 54:56.352
Reviving cryonized people
are so expensive at the moment

54:56.367 --> 54:58.399
that someone would have to have
a special interest in them.

54:59.090 --> 55:00.338
And be willing to pay for it.

55:02.348 --> 55:03.354
This is it.

55:05.017 --> 55:07.345
This is what you wanted to see.

55:08.340 --> 55:09.352
Here is Naomi.

55:10.004 --> 55:13.329
We put her back in the capsule
after we performed the cell scan.

55:13.345 --> 55:17.348
I'm afraid her organism is in
worse condition than yours was, Marc.

55:18.008 --> 55:20.256
Her disease had caused
considerable damage when she died.

55:20.271 --> 55:22.369
And it took too long
to properly cryonize her.

55:24.330 --> 55:25.380
So...

55:26.352 --> 55:27.363
It's too risky.

55:28.213 --> 55:32.010
We could be exposing her to
some very serious after effects.

55:32.028 --> 55:34.356
- The previous experiences were...
- I promise.

55:35.201 --> 55:38.360
I promise you, we will
study the case carefully.

55:40.109 --> 55:42.331
I don't want you to
get your hopes up, Marc.

56:06.057 --> 56:09.342
<i>Would things have turned out any
differently if I'd lived longer?</i>

56:11.032 --> 56:14.339
<i>Could my relationship with Naomi
have been any different?</i>

56:20.341 --> 56:21.352
<i>What was it?</i>

56:23.352 --> 56:24.361
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

56:26.001 --> 56:27.358
<i>The need to constantly be seeking</i>

56:27.373 --> 56:30.360
<i>some unknown source of fulfillment.</i>

56:32.140 --> 56:34.322
<i>The hunger for experiences in life</i>

56:34.337 --> 56:36.300
<i>that always made me
wanna be everywhere</i>

56:36.316 --> 56:39.342
<i>except where I actually was.</i>

56:46.020 --> 56:50.311
<i>Life seemed like it was
always just around the corner.</i>

56:51.007 --> 56:55.322
<i>Or in some brief moment passed
that only remained in memory.</i>

56:56.322 --> 56:57.330
<i>Never here.</i>

56:58.320 --> 56:59.329
<i>Never now.</i>

57:00.092 --> 57:04.308
<i>It was a promise
always perceived intuitively.</i>

57:04.322 --> 57:05.340
<i>In a scent.</i>

57:06.330 --> 57:07.342
<i>In a glance.</i>

57:08.133 --> 57:10.350
<i>In the vague feelings
caused by nostalgia.</i>

57:12.005 --> 57:15.348
<i>In the touch of a body that
reminds us of the person we love.</i>

57:21.124 --> 57:26.355
<i>Why then, not simply in the
touch of the person we love?</i>

57:31.015 --> 57:33.342
What are you gonna do
in the 22nd century?

57:33.358 --> 57:36.334
Open a funky little
advertising boutique?

57:37.034 --> 57:39.315
Suppose they actually
bring you back to life,

57:39.330 --> 57:40.358
What are you going to do...

57:40.373 --> 57:42.360
years and years from now?

57:43.158 --> 57:44.347
Getting old.

57:44.362 --> 57:45.364
All alone.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.355
You'll die heartbroken!

57:49.111 --> 57:51.349
I said I would give you this time.

57:52.100 --> 57:53.350
Is that worth nothing to you?

57:55.027 --> 57:56.302
You have no right.

57:56.317 --> 57:58.339
Your life does not
belong to you alone.

57:58.354 --> 58:01.342
Who the fuck is gonna
care about you in the future?

58:01.357 --> 58:04.242
More than the people that care
about you, and love you right now?

58:04.257 --> 58:06.353
Who's ever gonna care
about you more than me?

58:11.333 --> 58:13.340
There'll be other people to love.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.345
Other people will care about me.

58:18.257 --> 58:20.328
Ugh, you fucker!

58:20.521 --> 58:22.330
You fucker, no, no!

58:22.650 --> 58:25.351
God! You fucking asshole! No!

58:31.320 --> 58:32.332
Hey.

58:45.337 --> 58:46.340
You're wrong.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.335
Life is...

58:53.120 --> 58:56.338
Finding harmony in
life is too difficult.

58:57.340 --> 58:58.343
It's too fragile.

59:00.054 --> 59:03.349
You think I'm gonna be able to find
it in another place, another time?

59:24.652 --> 59:26.346
Are you really sure about this?

01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:20.350
Those all for me?

01:00:21.248 --> 01:00:22.335
Mark, what are you doing here?

01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:23.368
Are you okay?

01:00:23.392 --> 01:00:26.347
There's so many, it'd be
easy to make a mistake.

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:29.338
Others maybe, not me.

01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:31.319
Come sit down.

01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:46.065
Elizabeth, do you know anything about

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.348
the experiences previous
to my reanimation?

01:00:50.331 --> 01:00:51.324
Experiences?

01:00:51.339 --> 01:00:53.340
I was wondering how many
rehearsals they need.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.427
How many doubts they have to resolve

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.368
before they reanimate someone.

01:00:57.386 --> 01:00:59.358
Must be a very long process.

01:01:00.009 --> 01:01:02.350
You mean other people before you?

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.330
Exactly.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.310
I don't know.

01:01:07.328 --> 01:01:08.967
I hadn't thought about it.

01:01:08.983 --> 01:01:11.406
You know, everybody here signed
a confidentiality agreement.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.336
Is this about Naomi?

01:01:19.016 --> 01:01:21.730
Someday, they'll overcome
all of these difficulties.

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:25.340
And you'll be able to be
together again, just like before.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.338
It's only a matter of time.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:30.597
Okay?

01:01:36.038 --> 01:01:37.301
I'm gonna finish my walk.

01:01:37.316 --> 01:01:38.317
Wait, I'll go with you.

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:39.878
No, no, really.

01:01:40.019 --> 01:01:41.378
There's no need.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.206
Will you really be okay?

01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:49.194
Yeah.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.386
Thank you, Elizabeth.

01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:31.921
<i>His anxiety isn't going away.</i>

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.362
<i>He seems more...</i>

01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:35.347
Detached.

01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:38.371
And some of his behavior is
similar to the first week's.

01:02:39.158 --> 01:02:41.345
How accurate would you
say these memories are?

01:02:41.361 --> 01:02:44.362
80 percent. I recorded
them almost immediately.

01:02:46.154 --> 01:02:49.371
Well, clearly we've been unable to
halt the depersonalization process.

01:02:50.053 --> 01:02:52.364
Do you think neural damage
might be spreading?

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.232
Oh, no. He's only just
recently informed of Naomi.

01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:56.237
So it's normal for him to feel confused.

01:02:56.237 --> 01:02:57.226
Let's not get ahead of ourselves and

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.347
mistake this for something that it's not.

01:02:59.364 --> 01:03:02.351
I don't know, I'm afraid there's
something we're incapable of seeing.

01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:05.348
His mind is always...
way ahead of...

01:03:07.139 --> 01:03:09.339
I, I'm just afraid of
what he might think.

01:03:11.128 --> 01:03:12.360
Do you have a suggestion to make?

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.410
I say we get him outta here.

01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:18.402
Let him see the world and
forget himself for a little while.

01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:20.332
It's still too soon, Elizabeth.

01:03:20.348 --> 01:03:22.220
His organism is still very fragile.

01:03:22.235 --> 01:03:23.379
You know his lungs are still not ready.

01:03:23.395 --> 01:03:26.105
Besides, things on the
outside are still too hot

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.367
because of the rumors
about our experiments.

01:03:28.156 --> 01:03:29.356
More protests have been announced.

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:31.360
It's too risky to let Marc out

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.388
before we've presented
the project to the media.

01:03:34.405 --> 01:03:36.320
I'll up the dosages of all
anticonvulsants and tranquilizers.

01:03:36.335 --> 01:03:37.367
What do you think?

01:03:37.383 --> 01:03:39.348
We might have to reduce
the disconnections.

01:03:39.363 --> 01:03:41.329
And be on the lookout for
possible respiratory depression.

01:03:41.345 --> 01:03:43.333
What about being straight with him?

01:03:44.182 --> 01:03:45.342
It might help him.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:48.338
You know, let's explain to him
that his neurons aren't dying

01:03:48.354 --> 01:03:50.346
and his memories aren't
being erased for no reason.

01:03:50.362 --> 01:03:52.346
That we do know the cause.

01:03:53.006 --> 01:03:55.360
Let's explain to him that
he's boycotting himself.

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:57.355
Elizabeth, even if Marc
were able to understand,

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.352
he wouldn't be prepared
to take control.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.328
And the process might even
accelerate if you attempted

01:04:02.343 --> 01:04:04.324
to throw in the towel
and give up altogether.

01:04:05.004 --> 01:04:06.348
That's not the real issue here.

01:04:07.008 --> 01:04:09.329
Marc's decision is what matters.

01:04:10.002 --> 01:04:11.332
He isn't here by chance.

01:04:12.005 --> 01:04:15.329
He chose to stop living so
he could have another life.

01:04:18.007 --> 01:04:21.334
Well, he certainly feels
very guilty about Naomi.

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.348
No wonder.

01:04:23.009 --> 01:04:27.350
He sacrificed a remarkable
woman for an inadequate dream.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:30.320
Marc is an adult

01:04:30.335 --> 01:04:33.338
who made his own decisions and
has to live with the consequences.

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:36.340
He'll get over it...
in due time.

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:40.352
Elizabeth...

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.346
There's no need to
tackle it all by yourself.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.348
You mustn't.

01:04:46.003 --> 01:04:48.351
It's important you don't
transmit this uneasiness to Marc.

01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:52.286
If you need a rest,
please tell us.

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:54.389
I need you happy.

01:05:38.357 --> 01:05:39.360
The bosses gave me permission.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:41.321
We can have sex now.

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:42.335
But softly.

01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:44.338
So...

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.329
This pill is so you
can maintain erection.

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:51.337
And this is a desire stimulant.
One for each of us.

01:05:51.628 --> 01:05:53.345
Everybody uses them.
I always take them.

01:05:54.005 --> 01:05:57.338
They increase desire quickly
and without side effects.

01:07:06.363 --> 01:07:07.372
Are you all right?

01:07:08.343 --> 01:07:09.368
I'm sorry.

01:07:10.366 --> 01:07:11.357
I'm still hurt.

01:07:17.354 --> 01:07:18.360
It's okay.

01:07:20.151 --> 01:07:23.348
<i>Before I died, I thought
there was nothing after death.</i>

01:07:26.028 --> 01:07:27.237
<i>Now, I'm sure.</i>

01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:34.140
<i>Why do we yearn so
desperately for life after death?</i>

01:07:34.156 --> 01:07:35.331
<i>I did a reset, but
they're not responding...</i>

01:07:36.147 --> 01:07:37.340
<i>What is it that we want?</i>

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.352
Okay, I'm coming.

01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:43.339
<i>Perhaps reward for our grief.</i>

01:07:46.127 --> 01:07:47.358
<i>Or punishment for our sins.</i>

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.359
<i>No.</i>

01:07:57.009 --> 01:08:00.360
<i>What we really expect to find
is what we already know.</i>

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.356
<i>What we once had...</i>

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.368
<i>And lost.</i>

01:08:11.332 --> 01:08:12.361
<i>If there was something...</i>

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.360
<i>We would turn it
into more of the same.</i>

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.859
<i>The same chaos and
the same beauty.</i>

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.156
<i>The same reward
for the same effort.</i>

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:34.555
<i>The same tale
by the same idiot.</i>

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.356
<i>If there was something...</i>

01:08:40.372 --> 01:08:42.348
<i>It will probably be purgatory.</i>

01:08:47.008 --> 01:08:49.339
<i>Allow me to show you
what it might look like.</i>

01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:51.428
- No!
- We're here.

01:08:52.037 --> 01:08:52.956
Come on!

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.337
- Aah!
- What happened?

01:08:55.357 --> 01:08:57.028
We don't know.

01:08:57.247 --> 01:08:58.417
Alex, back off, please.

01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:02.750
Easy, easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:03.850
Easy. Easy.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.140
That's it, lie down.

01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:07.140
Take a rest.

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:11.352
- No, no, no, no, my God!
- Relax, relax.

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.348
Introduce mixture.

01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:14.354
250.

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:17.346
He's not responding!

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.345
He doesn't respond to Mother.

01:09:18.361 --> 01:09:20.372
What's going on here?
He was fine a minute ago!

01:09:20.388 --> 01:09:21.352
Hold him! Hold him down!

01:09:21.368 --> 01:09:23.339
Give me an I.M.!
Give me an I.M.!

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.528
- He's all right.
- Put him back to bed.

01:09:27.104 --> 01:09:29.429
<i>Alright, get him back up here, c'mon!
Let's plug him back in.</i>

01:09:30.684 --> 01:09:33.340
<i>He still doesn't respond.
I can't get him to respond.</i>

01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:36.392
Take it easy.
Everything will be all right.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.988
Is there something you want, Lazarus?

01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:45.340
Easy, shh...

01:09:47.325 --> 01:09:48.368
Shh...

01:09:50.099 --> 01:09:51.328
It's okay.

01:09:52.783 --> 01:09:53.599
We're here with you.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.889
- Strap him down! Strap him down!
- Get him out of me!

01:09:56.042 --> 01:09:59.388
- Ah!
- No, no, no, Oh my God! No!

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.298
Oh, my God, Lazarus!
What have you done?

01:10:10.354 --> 01:10:11.345
What have you done?

01:10:13.829 --> 01:10:15.040
Very good.

01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:17.498
Keep going.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.460
You can do it.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.039
Concentrate. Right foot.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:29.131
You can do it.

01:10:36.124 --> 01:10:38.039
Okay, follow my finger.

01:10:40.832 --> 01:10:42.869
Alright, blink once if you can hear me.

01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:46.542
Please follow my finger.

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.351
Thank you.

01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:05.258
Thank you.

01:11:06.539 --> 01:11:07.550
Yes.

01:11:07.566 --> 01:11:11.326
Tonight will most certainly
go down in history.

01:11:11.675 --> 01:11:13.650
And all of you with it.

01:11:15.428 --> 01:11:16.638
'Cause we have done it.

01:11:17.788 --> 01:11:20.830
The journey has been
replete with prejudice,

01:11:21.039 --> 01:11:23.371
legal barriers,

01:11:23.788 --> 01:11:26.341
doubts and sacrifice.

01:11:27.045 --> 01:11:28.410
But we overcame.

01:11:29.204 --> 01:11:31.286
We have made possible the dream

01:11:31.495 --> 01:11:32.589
<i>long held by humanity,</i>

01:11:33.607 --> 01:11:36.380
<i>in his struggle against
disease and time.</i>

01:11:37.305 --> 01:11:39.800
<i>And we couldn't have
done it without you...</i>

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:44.358
<i>Our investors, stockholders,
allies, collaborators...</i>

01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:45.640
<i>Scratch that.</i>

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:48.603
<i>Without you, we couldn't
even have begun to dream.</i>

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.369
- <i>That is why tonight...</i>
- How are you?

01:11:53.303 --> 01:11:55.385
The painkillers should
have taken effect by now.

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:59.318
<i>Not only does this day position
Prodigy as a leader in our field...</i>

01:12:00.304 --> 01:12:04.354
And you will be compensated for
your generosity and boldness.

01:12:05.365 --> 01:12:10.358
But most importantly, because of what
our advancements mean for humanity.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.820
Because we will prevail.

01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:17.301
It's time. Please.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:22.304
<i>That is why I want you to
be the first to see him...</i>

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.350
<i>speak to him, to touch and feel.</i>

01:12:27.118 --> 01:12:29.860
<i>Believe me, he is
worthy of admiration.</i>

01:12:30.698 --> 01:12:33.809
<i>Without his courage, determination,</i>

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:37.690
<i>and patience in the
face of many setbacks,</i>

01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:41.006
the miracle would not
have been possible.

01:12:43.341 --> 01:12:44.369
Music!

01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:55.398
Lazarus...

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.388
Come forth!

01:13:00.942 --> 01:13:02.381
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.301
after nearly a century deceased,

01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:07.349
Marc Jarvis,

01:13:07.366 --> 01:13:10.584
the first human being
ever resurrected!

01:14:00.362 --> 01:14:01.387
Hello.

01:14:06.056 --> 01:14:08.349
I'm very happy to be alive.

01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:18.684
Please, forgive him.
He appears to be frozen again.

01:14:20.887 --> 01:14:22.348
You'd better take a seat, Marc.

01:14:22.811 --> 01:14:25.158
Because what I'm about to say
will knock your socks off.

01:14:29.612 --> 01:14:33.711
You see, in his past life,
Marc had a great love.

01:14:34.399 --> 01:14:38.687
A love cut short by
illness and death.

01:14:40.221 --> 01:14:41.698
Her name was Naomi.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:48.071
And Naomi, having missed Marc,
for the rest of her life,

01:14:48.599 --> 01:14:52.019
decided that she, too,
would have herself cryonized.

01:14:52.811 --> 01:14:54.501
Of course, here at Prodigy,

01:14:54.638 --> 01:14:57.598
we couldn't let their
story go unfinished.

01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:59.845
So, we're gonna do it.

01:15:01.137 --> 01:15:05.345
Naomi Keller will be the second
human being ever resurrected.

01:15:23.498 --> 01:15:26.805
Don't worry, we won't be asking
you to take out your wallets.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.678
You'll gladly hand them to us.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.289
Because the future of
medicine is in our hands.

01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:38.692
Because immortality...

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:41.792
is only a question of time.

01:15:55.409 --> 01:15:56.328
Marc.

01:16:00.084 --> 01:16:02.751
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

01:16:03.014 --> 01:16:05.698
We wanted to share
your big night with you.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.397
You know, I wonder
who's really the monster.

01:16:09.302 --> 01:16:12.490
Me, for what I am,
or you, for what you've done.

01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:15.301
Who said anything
about monsters, Marc?

01:16:15.512 --> 01:16:16.284
I did.

01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:19.699
I suppose, you've seen the recordings.

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.683
You could've closed the file
cabinets, so I wouldn't notice.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.681
Listen, 

01:16:30.112 --> 01:16:33.345
not a single day goes by,
not a single moment

01:16:33.498 --> 01:16:35.800
that I don't remember those people.

01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:39.468
I recite their names
to myself every morning.

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.029
At first, I was so tortured
by each failed reanimation,

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.697
that it made me wanna
quit the project.

01:16:46.886 --> 01:16:50.380
I'd prepared my resignation
over and over again.

01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:52.866
But at the same time,

01:16:53.101 --> 01:16:56.311
each failed attempt brought
us closer to our goal.

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:59.798
Every time, it made more and
more sense to try again.

01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:04.659
Did you think reanimating you
would be the result of some miracle?

01:17:06.109 --> 01:17:10.684
The suffering of those people
became a living hell for me.

01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:12.376
I couldn't sleep anymore.

01:17:12.429 --> 01:17:15.876
I lost my family when
they found out about it.

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:20.690
But that was the risk I had to
take to get as far as we have.

01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:23.691
To bring you back to life, Marc.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.539
Do you still not see
how important it is?

01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:36.300
I can't stop you from talking about
what you saw in those recordings.

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:38.015
I won't.

01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:40.795
But Prodigy's standing is
very fragile at the moment.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.500
And if you talk about it,
Project Lazarus will go bankrupt.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.398
That's the bottom line, Marc.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:49.152
The failed reanimations
are my responsibility

01:17:49.369 --> 01:17:51.348
and I have to live with that.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.103
But you have another responsibility
as the key to the project.

01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:57.382
You get to decide whether or
not humanity will ever

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.959
have a chance to benefit from it.

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:01.550
Were they part of humanity?

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.342
Maybe not to you people.

01:18:05.542 --> 01:18:09.334
Maybe they're out-of-date humanity,
or second-rate humanity.

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:11.340
You know, I don't believe you.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.799
I don't believe you ever
really cared about their pain.

01:18:16.137 --> 01:18:17.448
Do you care?

01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:22.338
Do you really care about my pain?

01:18:22.354 --> 01:18:23.834
Of course, I do!

01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:28.535
I have done everything I can to
treat you and ease your pain.

01:18:29.211 --> 01:18:32.697
I can't give you a better life
than the one I already have.

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:40.947
And you know what?

01:18:41.749 --> 01:18:44.280
Maybe that's the part
you can't take.

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:48.448
That the life I gave you isn't
the one you were expecting.

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:51.440
You wanted paradise for
a few thousand dollars,

01:18:51.630 --> 01:18:53.659
and I only gave you
the life you already have,

01:18:53.841 --> 01:18:56.180
with all its defects and
all its limitations.

01:18:56.197 --> 01:18:57.356
I might have a body that's
loaded with defects,

01:18:57.363 --> 01:18:59.948
but I noticed I'm pretty strong.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.486
I know.

01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:03.786
I created your muscles.

01:19:04.712 --> 01:19:09.448
And I see you people from the outside,
and I don't... I don't care about you.

01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:12.248
And I don't care if you live or die.

01:19:13.762 --> 01:19:16.685
It'd be very easy to cross
the line and take revenge.

01:19:17.756 --> 01:19:19.452
But you haven't got the guts.

01:19:23.172 --> 01:19:26.978
I crossed the line and
Project Lazarus is all I have left.

01:19:27.212 --> 01:19:31.198
If you cross it,
you'll be left with nothing.

01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:17.350
Drink this.

01:20:17.966 --> 01:20:19.292
It will make you feel better.

01:20:25.712 --> 01:20:27.038
I'm sorry, Marc.

01:20:27.626 --> 01:20:30.344
I'm sorry that I'm the
least capable of all people

01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:32.338
to relieve you of your loneliness.

01:21:01.248 --> 01:21:03.037
But she's so young for you!

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.829
- Hey, Jeffrey!
- What? Yo!

01:21:07.751 --> 01:21:10.501
<i>Can a man be alive
only in his mind?</i>

01:21:11.092 --> 01:21:13.364
<i>Live only based on memories?</i>

01:21:16.002 --> 01:21:19.301
<i>I can't forget</i>

01:21:19.317 --> 01:21:22.341
<i>the life we've had</i>

01:21:22.357 --> 01:21:25.335
<i>or the love we shared</i>

01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:29.338
<i>the tenderness</i>

01:21:30.008 --> 01:21:32.428
<i>How could I love</i>

01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:36.326
<i>anyone else</i>

01:21:37.006 --> 01:21:42.335
<i>if i was born again?</i>

01:21:49.512 --> 01:21:51.348
God, I've missed you.

01:21:55.018 --> 01:21:56.354
How are you?

01:21:56.872 --> 01:21:58.106
I'm fine.

01:21:58.356 --> 01:21:59.367
How are you?

01:21:59.384 --> 01:22:02.667
I'm great. Everybody came.

01:22:03.045 --> 01:22:04.376
I'm happy.

01:22:05.178 --> 01:22:07.277
Everything's going like I wanted.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.210
You are the only thing missing.

01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:13.808
I'm here. I'm here.

01:22:18.512 --> 01:22:19.707
Hey, you know?

01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:24.241
I've been thinking a lot about us

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.412
And I think, despite everything...

01:22:28.901 --> 01:22:32.289
Ours was one hell of a love story.

01:22:33.128 --> 01:22:35.994
It is one hell of a love story.

01:22:40.178 --> 01:22:41.640
Let's join the party.

01:22:42.013 --> 01:22:43.059
Wait, Marc.

01:22:48.622 --> 01:22:49.618
I'll do it.

01:22:52.987 --> 01:22:55.380
I'm... I'm gonna be
with you when it happens.

01:23:06.327 --> 01:23:10.620
<i>Your heart is made of gold</i>

01:23:14.404 --> 01:23:25.010
<i>How could I love you through
someone else?</i>

01:23:27.518 --> 01:23:28.821
Thank you, Naomi.

01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.348
<i>Look to the streets,
watching your feet,</i>

01:23:32.504 --> 01:23:35.009
<i>as they slowly walk away,</i>

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.009
<i>sunlight guides you to the corner.</i>

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:41.249
<i>Pull over please,
my mistery,</i>

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:43.249
<i>there's something I need to say</i>

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:46.249
<i>why don't you choose this time to stay.</i>

01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:50.037
<i>A little after midnight,</i>

01:23:50.126 --> 01:23:53.209
Don't steal my man.
Don't you steal him! He's mine!

01:23:53.309 --> 01:23:55.349
<i>you seem so far away from home.</i>

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:59.349
<i>I've got ganas to besarte,</i>

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.349
<i>but has to alejarme,</i>

01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:04.349
<i>here we go again.</i>

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.509
<i>Look to the streets
watching your feet,</i>

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.349
<i>as they slowly walk away,</i>

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.349
<i>sunlight guides you to the corner.</i>

01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:16.249
<i>Pull over please,
my mistery,</i>

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.249
<i>there's something I need to say</i>

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.249
<i>why don´t you choose this time to stay.</i>

01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:23.577
Marc, Marc, Marc, Marc!

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:26.292
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, Naomi!

01:24:26.388 --> 01:24:28.149
<i>donde nos lleven los pies <i></i></i>

01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:30.149
<i>(oh yeeeee)<i></i></i>

01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:34.149
<i>And I'm waiting for this moment,<i></i></i>

01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:36.749
<i>come again.<i></i></i>

01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:39.649
<i>(oh yeeeee)<i></i></i>

01:24:39.849 --> 01:24:40.949
<i>¡Dale!<i></i></i>

01:24:58.049 --> 01:25:00.349
<i>Se viene, se viene, se viene y se va.</i>

01:25:02.049 --> 01:25:05.349
<i>Se viene, se viene, se viene y se va.</i>

01:25:05.599 --> 01:25:07.212
<i>Could I live in the past,</i>

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.826
<i>going over and over it with
Mind Writer,</i>

01:25:11.178 --> 01:25:12.575
<i>filling it in,</i>

01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:14.785
<i>polishing it,</i>

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.994
<i>making things up,</i>

01:25:18.211 --> 01:25:20.576
<i>until it reaches perfection?</i>

01:25:21.762 --> 01:25:22.868
I love you.

01:25:32.053 --> 01:25:33.182
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:38.368
<i>There's only one thing
I can see clearly now.</i>

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.697
<i>Life is nothing more
than a state of matter,</i>

01:25:42.882 --> 01:25:44.781
<i>like a gas or a liquid,</i>

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.862
<i>a form of molecular organization,</i>

01:25:50.203 --> 01:25:53.748
<i>and there's nothing transcendent
or divine about it.</i>

01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:01.246
<i>Its only objective is to
perpetuate itself through motion,</i>

01:26:01.505 --> 01:26:03.948
<i>change, adaptation.</i>

01:26:05.212 --> 01:26:10.448
<i>Life isn't worried about any species,
much less any individual.</i>

01:26:11.255 --> 01:26:15.247
<i>We're nothing more than the
chunks of mud it uses as a vehicle.</i>

01:26:16.547 --> 01:26:19.536
<i>Life is what's scary, not death.</i>

01:26:19.754 --> 01:26:22.159
<i>That it's always on
the verge of extinction.</i>

01:26:24.756 --> 01:26:27.827
<i>That it exists wherever it shouldn't.</i>

01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:41.869
<i>And the soul, you may ask.</i>

01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:44.119
<i>What about the soul?</i>

01:26:45.337 --> 01:26:49.454
<i>Well, maybe the soul is the bit that
gets lost when you freeze the meat</i>

01:26:49.712 --> 01:26:51.704
<i>and then thawed out again.</i>

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:25.948
Hi, Elizabeth.

01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:28.329
Hi, Marc.

01:27:29.132 --> 01:27:30.869
- How are you.
- Fine.

01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:34.079
I'm fine.

01:27:39.257 --> 01:27:42.248
We'll have to get you back
to the room and connect you.

01:27:43.022 --> 01:27:44.619
It's been a long night.

01:27:46.132 --> 01:27:48.868
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

01:27:49.092 --> 01:27:51.537
The Naomi announcement is big news.

01:27:53.255 --> 01:27:56.728
Her being here will make
you feel better, you'll see.

01:27:56.754 --> 01:27:57.788
Less alone.

01:27:58.882 --> 01:28:02.748
What about you?
Won't you feel alone?

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:06.192
Didn't you feel more alone tonight?

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:09.747
I love both of you.

01:28:10.013 --> 01:28:13.829
I can't wait to meet Naomi.
I'm sure we'll get along great.

01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:16.967
There's been enough guinea pigs
already, don't you think?

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:22.197
Marc, they're not going to reanimate
her if they're not sure about it.

01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:24.495
I don't even wanna imagine Naomi

01:28:24.713 --> 01:28:28.196
feeling like she's
trapped in someone else's body.

01:28:28.383 --> 01:28:30.285
Someone else's life.

01:28:30.501 --> 01:28:34.001
- That's your fear talking right now.
- Fear again, huh?

01:28:35.513 --> 01:28:36.619
You know...

01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:41.996
There's something I haven't
told you about my past life.

01:28:44.631 --> 01:28:46.786
I never talked to you
about the day I died.

01:28:48.841 --> 01:28:50.453
Naomi was with me.

01:28:51.014 --> 01:28:54.198
Picked a day and
everything was ready.

01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:56.829
We'd say goodbye to each other.

01:28:57.917 --> 01:29:01.459
And at the last moment, right before
I was about to drink the poison

01:29:01.667 --> 01:29:03.959
that would stop my
heart from beating,

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.329
I realized that the last few months
had somehow been the best of my life.

01:29:10.838 --> 01:29:15.699
Squeezing every drop out of each moment
in a way that I never have before.

01:29:16.513 --> 01:29:20.038
The happiness and the pain.
Everything was connected.

01:29:21.711 --> 01:29:24.948
But I had second thoughts
at that moment.

01:29:26.262 --> 01:29:27.828
I thought about putting it off.

01:29:28.922 --> 01:29:33.159
Living life to the fullest.
As long as my disease would let me.

01:29:34.512 --> 01:29:35.369
But, no.

01:29:37.341 --> 01:29:39.369
Because the happiness
I felt was only possible

01:29:39.591 --> 01:29:42.699
because I decided to kill myself.

01:29:43.422 --> 01:29:48.497
Suicide was my way of fighting
the arbitrariness of cancer.

01:29:48.712 --> 01:29:50.578
The only way to avoid the agony.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.619
And the uncertainty of when
death would finally arrive.

01:29:55.512 --> 01:29:57.948
The cryonization, it gave me hope.

01:29:58.632 --> 01:30:02.618
It gave me the faith
I didn't have to die peacefully.

01:30:05.013 --> 01:30:09.248
You know, the truth is, I never
really thought I would be reanimated.

01:30:10.804 --> 01:30:16.197
But doing what I did,
it gave me a program to follow.

01:30:16.421 --> 01:30:18.659
It restored a certain order to things.

01:30:19.801 --> 01:30:24.288
It gave me back control over my life.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:30.829
Finally, I had accepted
the idea of dying.

01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:35.039
I realized that was what mattered,

01:30:35.262 --> 01:30:37.697
that things were fine as they were.

01:30:39.882 --> 01:30:42.448
So, I drank the poison.

01:30:47.013 --> 01:30:48.748
The fear is gone.

01:30:52.262 --> 01:30:55.699
And right now, too,
things are fine as they are.

01:31:02.131 --> 01:31:04.538
You know, living again was worth it.

01:31:04.762 --> 01:31:06.659
'Cause I met you.

01:31:07.673 --> 01:31:09.619
That's been the best part.

01:31:11.421 --> 01:31:13.159
For me too, Marc.

01:31:14.512 --> 01:31:16.197
Then, will you help me?

01:31:17.712 --> 01:31:19.329
Of course, I will.

01:31:33.051 --> 01:31:36.979
All I need is the name of the
product and the necessary dosage.

01:31:37.262 --> 01:31:40.288
My job is to assist you in life,
not to help you end it.

01:31:40.513 --> 01:31:43.038
You're the only one
I can turn to, Elizabeth.

01:31:43.591 --> 01:31:45.868
Why? Why should I help you?

01:31:46.091 --> 01:31:48.329
'Cause you've seen everything I have.

01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:52.448
'Cause you understand what
I feel better than you'd like.

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:56.948
Because I need for
all of this to mean something.

01:31:58.341 --> 01:31:59.787
Because I'm all alone.

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:03.248
Because you love me.

01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:25.578
<i>The plan is simple.</i>

01:32:27.381 --> 01:32:30.578
<i>In the next few days, I'll
follow the advice of my doctors.</i>

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.869
<i>And record my remaining memories.</i>

01:32:33.511 --> 01:32:36.038
<i>But for you, not me.</i>

01:32:38.131 --> 01:32:41.159
<i>I'll relive my memories
for the last time.</i>

01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:45.698
<i>I'll wait until the weekend.</i>

01:32:50.284 --> 01:32:51.551
<i>Would you like to join us?</i>

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:10.959
Oxycrone.

01:33:44.626 --> 01:33:45.709
Oxycrone.

01:33:46.626 --> 01:33:47.959
Oxycrone.

01:35:57.921 --> 01:35:58.868
Remember.

01:36:00.051 --> 01:36:01.455
Two calls.

01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:02.658
Yes.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:06.288
First the cyronics lab and
one to 911.

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:08.829
And cardiac...

01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:10.948
Cardiac massage.

01:36:11.921 --> 01:36:14.288
- Gently.
- Right.

01:36:15.512 --> 01:36:17.288
Don't wake me up again.

01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:24.448
'kay.

01:37:22.762 --> 01:37:23.619
We got it.

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:42.788
Where you want the books?

01:37:43.012 --> 01:37:46.455
And this right here, is the best part.

01:37:46.631 --> 01:37:49.947
My... What?

01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.539
- Fuck you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude! Dude!

01:38:01.513 --> 01:38:03.579
And, you, know.

01:38:04.631 --> 01:38:05.287
- Then.
- Whoa.

01:38:09.579 --> 01:38:11.620
I dare you guys to jump today.

01:38:14.501 --> 01:38:15.167
No.

01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:25.258
Your mama's so fat, when she sat on
a rainbow, it turned into Skittles.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.289
Wait for me in... the water!

01:38:55.592 --> 01:38:57.198
<i>Poor Dr. West.</i>

01:38:58.042 --> 01:39:00.667
<i>Lazarus wants to return to obscurity.</i>

01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:03.659
<i>He was right.</i>

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:08.499
<i>Just like I wasn't ready to die,
I wasn't ready to live like this, either.</i>

01:39:08.712 --> 01:39:11.369
<i>Like most people from my time,</i>

01:39:11.584 --> 01:39:15.376
<i>I can't accept anything less than
the young, free and sensual world</i>

01:39:15.584 --> 01:39:19.792
<i>of the advertising Olympus
I'd grown accustomed to.</i>

01:39:20.012 --> 01:39:22.997
<i>The frozen shop window existence.</i>

01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:26.457
<i>A heaven for skeptics.</i>

01:39:52.417 --> 01:39:55.376
<i>Therefore, ladies and gentlemen
of the future...</i>

01:39:56.513 --> 01:39:59.950
<i>I hope this will help to
clarify my final wish</i>

01:40:01.342 --> 01:40:02.997
<i>To be nothing again.</i>

01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:05.998
<i>To disappear.</i>

01:40:08.258 --> 01:40:10.748
<i>To finally rest in peace.</i>

01:40:19.212 --> 01:40:21.288
<i>Although, I have a suspicion.</i>

01:40:24.754 --> 01:40:27.952
<i>It's possible that you might
never see this recording.</i>

01:40:29.921 --> 01:40:32.619
<i>It's possible that
Prodigy Health Corporation,</i>

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.788
<i>after investing so much into
Project Lazarus,</i>

01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:40.789
<i>after putting so much time into me,
might not permit this failure.</i>

01:40:41.092 --> 01:40:44.038
We found you just in time,
we managed to recover your organism.

01:40:44.254 --> 01:40:46.038
You are one very lucky young man.

01:40:46.255 --> 01:40:49.788
Please, forgive us.
How insolent of us.

01:40:50.012 --> 01:40:51.990
We should have been
more understanding.

01:40:53.512 --> 01:40:56.954
But trust me, we won't let you
feel discouraged again.

01:40:58.013 --> 01:41:00.159
You'll recover your will to live.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.164
