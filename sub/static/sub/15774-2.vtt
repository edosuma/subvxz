00:04.611 --> 00:05.969
Can I get a carrot cake?

00:06.089 --> 00:07.423
A whole cake?

00:07.543 --> 00:09.580
I'm having dinner
with Lola and her parents.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.447
So you're getting carrot cake?

00:11.567 --> 00:13.143
Isn't that a little cliche?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.252
Rabbits? Carrots?

00:15.639 --> 00:17.607
Man:
Here's your carrot cake.

00:19.271 --> 00:24.155
You know, on second thought, I think
I'll get a lemon meringue pie instead.

00:24.293 --> 00:27.265
Ooh. That sounds good.
Can I get a sample of that?

00:27.323 --> 00:29.249
I'm sorry.
We don't give samples.

00:29.393 --> 00:32.856
What? How do I know if I want
it if I can't sample it first?

00:32.937 --> 00:34.699
Come on.
Just give me a little taste.

00:34.796 --> 00:36.249
Here you go.

00:36.310 --> 00:37.692
What is the big deal?

00:37.713 --> 00:41.002
I'm talking about a teeny little taste.
No one would know.

00:41.003 --> 00:43.830
What do you think I'm gonna
shove my whole hand in it?

00:43.865 --> 00:47.052
You think I'm gonna rub my face in
it and ruin it for everyone else?

00:48.719 --> 00:50.390
Well, I wouldn't do that!

00:50.609 --> 00:55.044
I would take a teeny little taste
and then decide if I wanted it.

00:55.079 --> 00:56.480
Mmm.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.848
And I don't.

00:59.717 --> 01:03.020
You know what? I'll take
the carrot cake after all.

01:28.544 --> 01:30.612
- What are you writing?
- Do you mind?

01:30.647 --> 01:33.614
And why do you smell
like a lemon meringue pie?

01:33.661 --> 01:36.106
When are you done?
I need attention!

01:36.158 --> 01:38.093
I said give me 5 minutes!

01:42.962 --> 01:45.230
- How do you work your TV?
Tina: Shh.

01:45.264 --> 01:47.399
Someone's in a mood.

01:52.073 --> 01:55.609
- Am I an apple or a pear-shape?
- Be quiet!

02:00.216 --> 02:03.817
- Pear.
- And... Done.

02:03.887 --> 02:06.594
- What were you writing?
- An email to my boss

02:06.625 --> 02:10.258
...telling him everything I can't stand about him,
why he's a complete idiot...

02:10.306 --> 02:13.175
...and how he's a terrible manager,
and I hope he gets fired.

02:13.295 --> 02:15.763
You sent that to your boss?

02:15.797 --> 02:19.093
No, I wrote it to my boss,
but I'm not gonna send it.

02:19.168 --> 02:20.670
I'm gonna delete it.

02:22.436 --> 02:23.603
Much better.

02:23.873 --> 02:27.067
I don't get it. I mean, why would you go
to all the trouble to spell words...

02:27.068 --> 02:29.094
...and put them in
sentences and then delete it?

02:29.183 --> 02:33.425
It's a way to release anger and vent
your feelings without any repercussions.

02:33.449 --> 02:34.849
I do it all the time.

02:34.892 --> 02:37.260
Believe me, I've deleted
plenty of emails to you.

02:37.419 --> 02:39.753
Come on.
Let's go to dinner.

02:41.122 --> 02:42.658
What? I'm a pear!

02:42.716 --> 02:45.541
The skirt draws the eye
to my trim waistline...

02:45.595 --> 02:48.830
...and away from my generous hip area.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.898
I'll give it back.

02:57.188 --> 03:00.490
Bugs, this carrot cake is delicious.

03:00.531 --> 03:02.566
You know what's delicious?

03:02.608 --> 03:04.809
Lemon meringue pie.

03:05.078 --> 03:07.479
Have you ever had
a lemon meringue pie?

03:07.514 --> 03:11.150
I haven't had a lemon meringue
pie in years.

03:11.184 --> 03:13.324
But let's not dwell
on what you don't have.

03:13.351 --> 03:15.488
Let's be thankful for what you do.

03:15.536 --> 03:19.273
To bugs!
And his second-rate dessert.

03:21.061 --> 03:24.363
I am so happy that Lola found you.

03:24.397 --> 03:27.566
No matter where I hide,
she always does.

03:27.601 --> 03:32.464
You know, when Lola was a little girl, her
only companion was an imaginary friend.

03:32.503 --> 03:36.005
She used to talk to her for hours.
What was her name?

03:36.157 --> 03:38.891
Lola, what was the name
of your imaginary friend?

03:38.945 --> 03:42.039
Well, if you're gonna be like that,
I'm not gonna invite you to dinner anymore.

03:42.078 --> 03:46.261
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I was just
having a conversation with Piper.

03:46.410 --> 03:49.253
Piper!

03:49.287 --> 03:51.965
So, Mr. Bunny.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.068
Walter.

03:54.259 --> 03:57.259
Walter.
That's quite a family photo.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.973
Isn't it fun?
We take one every year.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.648
Wow. Matching pajamas.

04:11.706 --> 04:13.406
I have a great idea.

04:13.477 --> 04:15.855
Bugs should be in
our family photo this year.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.452
- What a splendid idea!
- Wonderful.

04:18.651 --> 04:22.120
Oh, no. I couldn't.
It's just for family.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.961
Don't be silly.
You are family!

04:25.021 --> 04:27.641
Yeah. Besides,
Piper's in all of them.

04:27.706 --> 04:30.308
What do you say?

04:30.429 --> 04:32.921
Ehh...

04:32.970 --> 04:33.999
Ok.

04:34.061 --> 04:35.761
- No way.
- What?

04:35.812 --> 04:38.113
But you just said,
"Ehh, ok."

04:38.305 --> 04:39.367
I'll look stupid.

04:39.422 --> 04:41.406
First of all,
you could never look stupid.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.901
Second of all, this photo isn't
about looks, it's about family.

04:44.979 --> 04:49.349
And third of all, did that carrot cake
make your stomach feel a little weird?

04:51.139 --> 04:53.740
Do we really need to wear
matching outfits?

04:53.782 --> 04:55.249
That's what makes it fun!

04:56.231 --> 05:00.113
Please? I promise, I will never,
ever ask you for another favor.

05:00.223 --> 05:02.024
- Fine.
- Yay!

05:02.098 --> 05:05.105
Oh, quick favor. Can you drive Piper home?
She lives really close.

05:05.128 --> 05:07.629
Piper, you good back there,
you want to sit up front?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.967
She's good back there.

05:14.484 --> 05:17.854
- Whatcha writing?
- A hate-filled email.

05:18.186 --> 05:20.254
Sounds healthy.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.514
And...done!

05:36.581 --> 05:38.382
Finally sent your little email?

05:38.565 --> 05:40.021
Oho, I didn't send it.

05:40.117 --> 05:43.236
That's the beauty of this
little psychological exercise.

05:43.308 --> 05:47.900
I get to express all of my rage and
jealousy, bitterness, and disgust...

05:47.950 --> 05:50.552
...without a single
negative repercussion.

05:50.695 --> 05:53.898
- How so?
- Because instead of pressing "Send..."

05:53.968 --> 05:56.669
I simply press delete.

05:59.030 --> 06:00.764
Oh, no!
How do I get it back?

06:00.885 --> 06:04.254
Do something!
Get it back! Get it back!

06:04.390 --> 06:06.452
Relax.
Who'd you send it to?

06:06.514 --> 06:08.082
Who'd I send it to?

06:14.001 --> 06:15.352
I don't think that many people.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.877
You didn't send that to me, did you?

06:19.983 --> 06:21.861
What? No.

06:21.898 --> 06:24.266
What bad things could I say about you?

06:24.645 --> 06:25.918
I love you.

06:25.943 --> 06:29.466
So, if I checked my email right now,
there'd be nothing from you.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.644
Nope.

06:37.692 --> 06:39.259
Yah!

06:47.016 --> 06:48.328
Ha! Delete!

06:48.365 --> 06:50.433
I mean, see?

06:50.468 --> 06:53.971
There was no email!

06:54.209 --> 06:56.544
Uh...

06:59.053 --> 07:00.821
My tooth!

07:02.021 --> 07:05.286
What? It's not like you're
about to take a family photo.

07:15.644 --> 07:19.380
Oof. You really did
a number on this guy.

07:19.453 --> 07:22.663
But we'll put a cap on it.
You'll be good as new.

07:22.822 --> 07:26.492
What a relief. I have to be in my
girlfriend's family photo later today.

07:26.526 --> 07:28.327
Today?
You're kidding me.

07:28.361 --> 07:31.564
A tooth the size of yours?
It's a monster.

07:31.641 --> 07:33.909
It'll take a week at least.

07:35.402 --> 07:38.780
Maybe I could smile with
my mouth closed.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.027
Uh, that doesn't look so bad.

07:41.078 --> 07:43.667
By the way, I got your friend's email.

07:43.759 --> 07:46.605
He's a real yutz, between you and me.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.685
Did you read it?
It's very hostile.

07:49.765 --> 07:53.601
I don't like hostility
in a doctor's practice.

07:58.137 --> 07:59.438
Psst!

08:01.107 --> 08:02.909
What's with the sunglasses?

08:02.967 --> 08:05.163
I'm keeping a low profile.

08:06.296 --> 08:08.156
You've got some nerve.

08:08.211 --> 08:10.182
What?
Because of the email?

08:10.231 --> 08:13.320
Because I said you're not
a scary witch? You're not!

08:13.372 --> 08:16.743
I mean, what's the point of the big hat
and the green skin and that stupid wand...

08:16.777 --> 08:19.027
...if you're not gonna do
anything scary with them?

08:21.301 --> 08:24.160
You wanna see scary? I'll show you scary.

08:24.161 --> 08:25.811
You better watch who you talking to...

08:25.843 --> 08:28.983
- ...and I ain't playing!
- Aah!

08:32.150 --> 08:34.855
- More iced tea?
- Not too much ice.

08:34.895 --> 08:38.152
You're mad?
Why are you mad?

08:38.251 --> 08:42.541
Because I said calling yourself
speedy sounds braggy? It does!

08:42.611 --> 08:44.711
I don't call myself handsome.

08:44.762 --> 08:48.596
You know what people
should call you? Jerk.

08:48.766 --> 08:50.988
Why is everyone so mad at you?

08:51.065 --> 08:52.862
I accidentally sent a mass email...

08:52.863 --> 08:55.575
...spelling out in great detail
how I feel about people.

08:55.610 --> 08:57.821
- Who else did you send it to?
- Everybody.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.922
Everyone
I've ever interacted with.

08:59.967 --> 09:03.468
Everyone who matters to me,
who I have a relationship with.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.411
Anyone who makes
any impression on me at all.

09:06.618 --> 09:08.553
So everybody.

09:08.587 --> 09:11.730
Every single person in my life.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.890
You didn't send it to me.

09:13.925 --> 09:15.726
Huh.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.261
Tina!

09:20.076 --> 09:22.143
Hold it right there!

09:24.635 --> 09:27.003
I got your little email.

09:27.037 --> 09:28.894
I read every word.

09:28.956 --> 09:32.492
And I gots just one thing
to say to you

09:32.643 --> 09:34.622
thank you, brother.

09:34.666 --> 09:36.200
You are so right.

09:36.335 --> 09:39.004
It was like you held a mirror up
to my soul.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.551
It gave me the kick in
the pants I needed...

09:41.586 --> 09:43.920
...to finally make a change
for the better.

09:43.955 --> 09:46.427
Well, say good-bye to
the man you once knew...

09:46.488 --> 09:50.090
...because my transformation begins now.

09:50.227 --> 09:53.562
That was a mask?

09:53.596 --> 09:56.498
Huh. I wonder if Tina will have
a similar reaction.

09:59.235 --> 10:01.036
Mother.

10:01.070 --> 10:02.871
Hey, Bugs.

10:02.905 --> 10:05.196
Bugs: Oh, hey, Lola.
I'll be down in a minute.

10:05.316 --> 10:06.687
Oh, take your time.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.803
I'm just gonna lay out some fun
stuff for today's photo shoot.

10:09.946 --> 10:11.613
It's a Western theme.

10:11.648 --> 10:15.183
Piper and I were up all night
bedazzling matching denim jumpsuits.

10:15.217 --> 10:18.466
Well, they're not actual denim jumpsuits
'cause I couldn't find denim jumpsuits.

10:18.486 --> 10:21.622
So I took jeans
and sewed denim jackets to them.

10:21.891 --> 10:24.192
And--well, they're a little hard
to get in and out of...

10:24.227 --> 10:27.262
So, you know, once you have them
on, they're pretty much on.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.955
Oh, I'm so excited!

10:28.978 --> 10:31.300
This is gonna be the
best family photo ever.

10:31.335 --> 10:35.472
Oh!
What happened to your tooth?

10:35.506 --> 10:38.935
Oh, yeah. Daffy accidentally
chipped it with my phone.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.784
They can't fix it until next week.

10:40.945 --> 10:43.112
Oh, so is this what we're wearing?

10:43.147 --> 10:45.432
Huh? Oh, no.

10:45.469 --> 10:47.871
Mmm. No, no. Heh.

10:48.085 --> 10:51.011
No, we cancelled the photo.
We cancelled it.

10:51.087 --> 10:56.392
Um, this stuff was all here when I got
here, just lying out when I got here.

10:56.509 --> 10:57.876
Must be Daffy's.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.919
You cancelled the photo?

11:00.950 --> 11:04.734
You know, I just started thinking.
Family photos are dumb. You don't--

11:04.768 --> 11:07.604
you don't need a photo to know
who's in your family, right?

11:07.638 --> 11:10.006
You know already for your whole life.

11:10.041 --> 11:12.008
You know who your family is.

11:12.043 --> 11:14.421
It's because of my tooth, isn't it?

11:14.485 --> 11:18.270
What? No. Your tooth?
No. We're just...

11:18.445 --> 11:20.717
...we're not taking a photo this year.

11:20.751 --> 11:21.985
So...

11:22.019 --> 11:25.322
You don't want me to be in the
photo because of my tooth.

11:25.356 --> 11:26.940
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

11:26.981 --> 11:32.027
I barely even noticed your broken,
gnarled, really jacked-up tooth.

11:32.163 --> 11:34.665
I'm gonna be in that photo.

11:34.699 --> 11:36.593
Oh, no, you're not.

11:36.694 --> 11:40.730
You don't even know where we're
taking it and you'll never find us.

11:42.331 --> 11:45.042
- Who are you calling? - Walter! Bugs.

11:45.987 --> 11:48.916
So looking forward
to the family photo.

11:48.931 --> 11:51.199
Where are we taking it again?

11:51.240 --> 11:53.441
Oh, no, you're not.

11:53.523 --> 11:56.925
Bugs:
Oh, that's right, the dude ranch!

11:56.975 --> 11:59.510
See you there, partner.

11:59.566 --> 12:02.891
Walter:
Ah, partner.

12:02.925 --> 12:04.860
You are not gonna be in that photo!

12:04.894 --> 12:07.706
Oh, I'm gonna be in that photo!

12:07.774 --> 12:09.440
And not only am I gonna be in it...

12:09.505 --> 12:11.942
I'm gonna be smiling so big. All you'll see is--

12:11.973 --> 12:14.454
This broken, gnarled, jacked-up tooth!

12:16.742 --> 12:19.344
Good afternoon, neighbor!

12:20.313 --> 12:22.614
Sam?

12:24.746 --> 12:26.014
Could I get 100 copies?

12:26.033 --> 12:28.168
Reward for a lost wallet?

12:28.288 --> 12:30.022
The wallet is the reward.

12:30.905 --> 12:32.748
Can you ever forgive me?

12:32.789 --> 12:34.984
I don't know what I would do
if I ever lost you!

12:35.028 --> 12:36.562
I mean, I'm sure I'd date again.

12:36.597 --> 12:38.598
Who knows? Maybe I'd meet
somebody better.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.266
What are you talking about?

12:40.300 --> 12:42.067
The email.

12:42.068 --> 12:43.570
What email?

12:43.604 --> 12:46.239
You didn't get my email this morning?

12:46.274 --> 12:48.508
No, I've been here since 6:00.

12:48.543 --> 12:51.712
My boss doubled my shift.
I didn't even get a lunch break.

12:51.746 --> 12:54.248
My phone's dead.
I left my charger at home.

12:54.282 --> 12:56.526
And I'm still here another 3 hours.

12:56.579 --> 12:57.836
That's great!

12:57.878 --> 13:03.181
I mean, uh, I'm so sorry
for you, my one true love.

13:04.761 --> 13:06.661
Mwah.

13:09.298 --> 13:10.993
Yes!

13:11.028 --> 13:12.428
Yes! Yes!

13:12.446 --> 13:14.419
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:14.474 --> 13:16.071
Oh, yeah!

13:20.766 --> 13:23.368
Bugs! Twice in one day.

13:23.424 --> 13:26.492
To what do I owe the pleasure?

13:27.418 --> 13:30.652
I need to borrow some cowboy
clothes for a photo I'm taking.

13:30.686 --> 13:34.002
Photo? With your choppers
all jacked up?

13:34.033 --> 13:35.493
I'm kinda in a hurry.

13:35.532 --> 13:38.033
Oh, absolutely!

13:38.327 --> 13:41.095
There's more where that came from.

13:41.129 --> 13:43.292
I don't wear it anymore.

13:43.369 --> 13:45.838
Uh, thanks.

13:46.069 --> 13:49.204
Have a great rest of your day!

13:50.160 --> 13:52.808
Explain
to me what we're doing here.

13:53.668 --> 13:57.212
I need you to help me break into
Tina's apartment and delete the email.

13:57.247 --> 13:59.934
You didn't think I was important
enough to send the email to...

13:59.965 --> 14:02.043
...and now, you want my help?

14:02.137 --> 14:03.537
You're on your own.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.917
Porky, if you help me with this...

14:06.011 --> 14:10.658
I promise, I will send you
a long, detailed email...

14:10.693 --> 14:13.662
...describing everything
I don't like about you.

14:13.696 --> 14:14.860
You promise?

14:14.907 --> 14:18.343
Porky, I am nothing
if not a man of principle.

14:18.394 --> 14:19.928
Now, let's break into this apartment.

14:20.103 --> 14:22.037
Aah!

14:34.701 --> 14:37.669
Where are Bugs and Lola?

14:39.055 --> 14:41.468
Get in the car! We're taking
the picture somewhere else!

14:41.594 --> 14:42.984
- Where's Bugs?
- What?

14:43.092 --> 14:45.394
Oh, he--he fell down a well.

14:45.428 --> 14:48.363
- What?
- Come on!

14:49.632 --> 14:51.567
Hey!

14:51.601 --> 14:53.702
Change of plans.

14:55.438 --> 14:57.973
Hyah! Come on!

14:58.909 --> 15:00.376
Aah!

15:08.385 --> 15:10.587
Daffy:
It's asking me for a password.

15:10.621 --> 15:14.114
Who has a password on their computer?
What could her password be?

15:14.246 --> 15:17.035
Hmm.
It's usually something personal.

15:17.106 --> 15:19.862
What's her mother's maiden name?

15:19.896 --> 15:21.484
Mmm.

15:21.531 --> 15:23.266
Does she have a pet?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.768
Hmm.

15:24.831 --> 15:26.766
Do you know her favorite color?

15:26.815 --> 15:28.405
Hmm.

15:28.530 --> 15:31.170
- What city was she born in?
- Mmm.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.006
Do you know anything about her?

15:33.061 --> 15:34.310
Hmm...

15:34.344 --> 15:37.123
I think her name's Tina,
but I'm not 100%.

15:37.178 --> 15:38.928
So a lot of times,
I just call her buddy.

15:41.952 --> 15:43.953
Surprise!

15:43.987 --> 15:44.987
Buddy.

15:45.022 --> 15:46.689
What are you doing here?

15:46.973 --> 15:50.112
I, uh--I know what a
hard day you've had...

15:50.148 --> 15:51.816
...so we came over to make you dinner.

15:51.855 --> 15:54.230
You know Porky's a caterer, right?

15:55.766 --> 15:57.400
This is weird.

15:57.692 --> 16:00.027
You're just tired from your day.

16:00.097 --> 16:01.270
Come with me.

16:01.304 --> 16:06.441
You take a hot bath.
We'll make you dinner.

16:06.476 --> 16:07.809
You have to make her dinner.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.744
What am I supposed to make?

16:10.090 --> 16:12.992
I don't know. You're the caterer.
I have to figure out her password.

16:14.842 --> 16:18.444
Darling? I hate to bother you
while you're soaking...

16:18.514 --> 16:20.754
...but what was
your mother's maiden name?

16:20.789 --> 16:22.647
Romano. Why?

16:22.748 --> 16:26.994
Uh, I just wanted to write her a
thank-you note for giving birth to you.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.041
Well, how come you want
her maiden name?

16:30.229 --> 16:34.668
Oh. Well, I didn't want your
father to open it by mistake...

16:34.703 --> 16:37.304
...because I wanna send him
a separate thank-you note.

16:37.339 --> 16:38.768
Keep soaking!

16:38.807 --> 16:41.442
- There's no food in here!
- Get creative!

16:41.476 --> 16:44.512
Turn yourself into a hot dog,
if you have to!

16:44.546 --> 16:46.281
Romano.

16:46.315 --> 16:48.550
Bingo. I'm in.

16:48.584 --> 16:51.253
Here it is.
It's still unread.

16:52.856 --> 16:55.157
Michael? Who's Michael?

16:55.192 --> 16:58.995
"Dear Tina,
I can't wait to see you again.

16:59.029 --> 17:01.530
I miss you and love you"?

17:01.565 --> 17:03.799
What are you doing?

17:03.834 --> 17:06.136
- Who's Michael?
- What?

17:06.170 --> 17:08.905
Do not play dumb with me.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.640
I read the email from Michael.

17:10.675 --> 17:13.611
Michael's my brother.
You met him?

17:15.046 --> 17:17.080
Oh, right.

17:17.115 --> 17:19.228
- What's this?
- Don't look at that.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.371
Is this the email
you were talking about?

17:21.446 --> 17:22.353
I can't look!

17:22.387 --> 17:24.221
Man, this is long.

17:24.256 --> 17:27.191
Foghorn, Speedy...

17:27.224 --> 17:30.661
Whoa. You really laid
into those gophers.

17:30.696 --> 17:32.596
Oh. Here we go.

17:32.631 --> 17:35.570
"I know I've said
a lot of terrible things...

17:35.609 --> 17:38.076
"...about a lot of terrible people...

17:38.201 --> 17:41.743
...but I've saved the terriblest
for my girlfriend Tina."

17:43.704 --> 17:46.714
"I have known many deranged
people in my life...

17:46.784 --> 17:49.752
...but I've never encountered
the kind of profound...

17:49.799 --> 17:52.893
...mental instability
that she possesses."

17:52.979 --> 17:55.686
Tina Russo is a psychopath."

17:55.721 --> 17:57.321
It's worse than I thought.

17:57.355 --> 17:59.533
"She may have everyone else fooled...

17:59.580 --> 18:01.291
...but I know the truth."

18:01.360 --> 18:05.196
"Why else would the kindest,
most beautiful...

18:05.230 --> 18:08.426
"...generous, and intelligent
woman in the world...

18:08.505 --> 18:10.879
...go out with someone like me?"

18:15.080 --> 18:17.415
- I love you.
- What?

18:17.629 --> 18:19.097
You're not gonna kill me?

18:19.142 --> 18:21.019
Ehh. Call me crazy.

18:21.053 --> 18:23.084
Actually, I called you a psychopath.

18:23.178 --> 18:26.957
Now, where's my catered dinner?

18:31.196 --> 18:34.565
Bugs! You got out of the well!

18:34.600 --> 18:38.770
- What?
- Oh, but your tooth is all jacked up!

18:38.804 --> 18:40.905
You're not getting in this photo!

18:40.939 --> 18:43.908
Oh, I'm getting in that photo!

19:06.593 --> 19:08.260
I knew I'd get in that photo.

19:08.322 --> 19:10.841
And...send.

19:11.252 --> 19:12.904
Oh! I deleted it!

19:12.938 --> 19:15.273
Was that your apology email?

19:15.580 --> 19:18.115
Nah. It was something
I promised I'd send to Porky.

19:18.237 --> 19:19.753
I bet he forgot all about it.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.970
Besides,

19:24.079 --> 19:26.438
I don't need to apologize to anyone.

19:26.508 --> 19:29.720
Ever heard of the expression
"Time heals all wounds"?

19:29.754 --> 19:31.889
Oh, hey, grandma.

19:31.923 --> 19:33.858
Oof.

19:34.726 --> 19:36.293
You'll be all right.

19:36.327 --> 19:38.261
Time will heal that.

19:43.781 --> 19:46.135
I loved this book.

19:46.169 --> 19:49.338
When Alex stood in front
of Rebecca's front door--

19:49.372 --> 19:52.074
Woman: Oh! And he didn't have
the courage to knock?

19:52.108 --> 19:54.176
Oh! Heartbreaking.

19:54.210 --> 19:58.549
I--I was sobbing.
Yosemite, what did you think of Alex?

19:59.293 --> 20:01.828
Excuse me for just a moment.

20:06.457 --> 20:09.092
- So good, really.
- I really loved it.

20:10.486 --> 20:13.564
You wanna know what I think of Alex?

20:13.599 --> 20:15.099
Well, I...

20:15.469 --> 20:17.403
...think he's pathetic!

20:17.437 --> 20:19.739
I mean, that's your protagonist?

20:19.774 --> 20:22.039
There's no arc to that character!

20:22.133 --> 20:24.125
What obstacle did he overcome?

20:24.188 --> 20:26.223
What was his emotional journey?

20:26.319 --> 20:29.522
In fact, the only thing
that's more pathetic than Alex...

20:29.579 --> 20:32.648
...is this book club!
Now, get out!

20:32.754 --> 20:36.089
Get! Get!
And don't forget your books!

20:36.123 --> 20:38.959
Yosemite Sam is back!

20:38.993 --> 20:41.528
Yee-haw!
