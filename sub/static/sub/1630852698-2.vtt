00:30.030 --> 00:31.489
Hey. Start recording.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.742
Red Cone Foot.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.785
I'll defeat you
and take over as the most powerful!

00:36.327 --> 00:37.620
Not a chance.

00:39.622 --> 00:40.790
Fuck! It hurts like hell!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.917
Fuck!

00:43.001 --> 00:45.545
-That's so funny.
-Stop it, dipshit! It fucking hurts!

00:48.381 --> 00:50.175
-What the hell?
-What's wrong with them?

00:50.925 --> 00:52.260
Hey, run!

00:52.343 --> 00:53.720
What the fuck is that?

00:53.803 --> 00:55.555
Fuck!

00:59.976 --> 01:01.728
That's not possible.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.897
Our students turn in their phones

01:03.980 --> 01:05.774
so none of them could've called.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.442
Yes.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.278
Yes, of course. Everything is fine here.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.821
Have a nice day.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.036
I told you to make sure
to take their phones.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.580
I even got you safes,
and they report a zombie outbreak?

01:20.663 --> 01:23.750
-What's wrong with you?
-How can you say everything is fine?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.085
It's mayhem out there.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.253
We need emergency services
to get the kids out.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.130
Are you the only teacher?
Are you that great?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.591
I told you
to resolve these matters internally!

01:31.674 --> 01:33.760
Get out. Tell the kids to go to class.

01:33.843 --> 01:34.844
But, sir,

01:34.928 --> 01:37.806
I don't think the kids will listen,
given the situation.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.599
Are you deaf? Get out there.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.769
If you'd go out and see for yourself--

01:42.852 --> 01:44.020
Just do as you're told.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.897
I made you the dean for a reason.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.110
Where are you going?
Stay here and don't do anything stupid.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.654
We should at least make
an emergency announcement.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.075
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

02:05.792 --> 02:08.044
Hey, you. What's up with your leg?

02:09.587 --> 02:10.797
Hey! What are you--

02:11.881 --> 02:14.008
Hey! What are you doing?

02:14.717 --> 02:15.677
Stop it!

02:18.429 --> 02:19.430
Hey!

02:36.197 --> 02:37.031
What's with you?

02:37.824 --> 02:38.658
Help!

02:58.928 --> 02:59.929
Are you okay?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.063
On-jo. Are you okay?

03:10.231 --> 03:11.191
Hey!

03:14.944 --> 03:15.904
Get up.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.950
Move! Out of the way!

03:24.662 --> 03:25.663
Are you okay?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.553
-Stop!
-Let's go!

03:52.732 --> 03:54.567
Hurry and get up there!

03:54.651 --> 03:55.652
Over there!

03:56.361 --> 03:57.278
Let's go.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.530
Fuck!

04:42.532 --> 04:44.200
Fuck!

04:57.964 --> 04:59.090
Get up there!

04:59.173 --> 05:00.174
You go first.

05:12.061 --> 05:12.895
Fuck!

05:40.882 --> 05:41.924
Damn it.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.563
Get lost. Fuck.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.778
Cheong-san!

06:09.035 --> 06:10.995
Why aren't you coming? Come out!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.498
On-jo.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.458
Hurry, Cheong-san.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.396
Run!

06:46.406 --> 06:48.157
HYOSAN BUILDING MATERIALS

08:24.879 --> 08:26.422
This way.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.221
Wait for me!

08:34.764 --> 08:39.018
Stay away. Stay away, you bastard.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.485
I told you to stay away, you asshole.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.244
Damn it. What's going on?

08:59.413 --> 09:00.790
Don't open the door. Don't!

09:00.873 --> 09:02.708
-We're not sure if they're intact.
-Let go.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.794
Hurry up! Lock the door!

09:04.877 --> 09:06.003
We need to open it.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.421
Hey, open the door!

09:07.505 --> 09:08.548
Move!

09:12.760 --> 09:13.719
Are you okay?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.096
On-jo!

09:18.015 --> 09:18.975
Are you okay?

09:20.309 --> 09:22.186
How are things outside? Is it the same?

09:33.072 --> 09:34.115
Hey.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.576
-What the hell? Who are you?
-You motherfucker.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.661
-Your brother-in-law.
-It's Dae-su.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.039
Fuck!

09:42.540 --> 09:43.833
They're fucking aggressive.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.793
What happened to you?

09:45.876 --> 09:48.713
Some crazy jerk
shot a fire extinguisher at me.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.464
-A fire extinguisher?
-Yes, fuck.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.551
What's going on?

09:53.634 --> 09:54.969
Who knows?

09:55.052 --> 09:55.970
Guys.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.765
-It's Train to Busan.
-What are you talking about, moron?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.684
Aren't they zombies? It's the same thing.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.228
Why are they at school?
They should be in movies.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.939
Come and look. I'm serious.

10:11.027 --> 10:11.944
Do I have to?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.030
Gyeong-su, the door!

10:14.947 --> 10:15.781
Right.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.743
Fuck.

10:19.827 --> 10:20.870
What the hell?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.246
-Hey, Bare-su!
-Push him off!

10:22.330 --> 10:23.414
-Quick!
-It's Bare-su!

10:23.497 --> 10:25.124
-Get in here.
-You okay?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.667
Prez! Hurry!

10:26.751 --> 10:29.170
-Come on!
-Behind you! Hurry!

10:29.253 --> 10:30.296
Jump!

10:32.089 --> 10:34.508
-Close it before anyone gets in.
-Are you okay?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.475
It's that, isn't it?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.186
Zombies.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.910
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

11:00.993 --> 11:02.286
AMBULANCE

11:05.581 --> 11:06.582
One, two, three.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.503
What happened to her?

11:10.586 --> 11:14.840
She came from the school. When we arrived,
she was lethargic and was bleeding.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.551
-When was she injured?
-We got the call half an hour ago.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.387
Why is she unconscious?

11:19.470 --> 11:22.598
She seemed to be having seizures at first,
but she's calm now.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.616
You received your PhD
in cell biology in the US and returned.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.786
You were a researcher
at a pharmaceutical company and quit,

11:43.869 --> 11:45.037
then went into teaching.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.456
With these qualifications,

11:47.540 --> 11:50.876
shouldn't you be a college professor
rather than a high school teacher?

11:51.585 --> 11:54.755
I told you to go to the hospital
and put Hyeon-ju in quarantine.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.552
Why did a teacher abduct a student?
At the school, at that.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.595
If I were a college professor,

12:02.430 --> 12:05.182
a prosecutor, or a reporter,
would you have still disregarded me?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.018
I see. So that's why you abducted her?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.897
Because no one listened to you
or understood how you felt?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.525
You were lonely and sad. Is that why?

12:15.317 --> 12:16.152
Fine.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.738
Let's stop it here.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.782
Who cares if everyone dies?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.660
This world and those bastards…

12:32.877 --> 12:36.922
I can't stand bastards like you.
I hate your kind.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.428
You commit the fucking crime,
but you blame others, society, the world.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.473
Even when you reported your missing son.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.975
"This world swallowed up my son."

12:48.058 --> 12:50.561
Yeah, right. Is this world an anaconda?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.229
Look.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.106
It didn't swallow him up.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.693
Give me a break.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.737
You killed your son,

13:00.738 --> 13:04.533
and you reported him as missing
to avoid being a suspect. Am I right?

13:05.910 --> 13:07.578
Your son isn't missing, is he?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.581
What happened to him?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.421
My son died.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.472
I put a cat and a mouse in the same box.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.765
MINSONG GYMNASIUM

13:27.848 --> 13:29.934
Most of the mice sat in a corner

13:30.017 --> 13:32.478
and were frozen, trembling in fear.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.524
But once in a while,

13:37.107 --> 13:39.401
there would be a mouse
that would lose all reason

13:39.485 --> 13:41.445
due to the overwhelming fear
and attack the cat.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.366
When this happens,
its testosterone level shoots up.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.786
I extracted that hormone and refined it.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.580
For all the mice
in this world trembling in fear.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.181
I thought that if fear turned into rage,
he'd become stronger than anyone.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.105
He bit his mother.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.235
Day 17 since infection.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.655
I stopped the haloperidol
and gave him benzodiazepine again.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.533
He'll be awake in less than ten minutes.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.500
You killed your son, didn't you?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.689
-What the…
-Hold her down.

14:58.772 --> 14:59.648
Turn it off!

15:11.243 --> 15:12.286
Hold her down!

15:32.514 --> 15:33.474
What's that noise?

15:34.683 --> 15:35.601
What's going on?

15:36.393 --> 15:38.562
MRI ROOM

15:38.646 --> 15:40.439
Has there been some sort of accident?

15:42.983 --> 15:44.401
Please help me.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.904
Call the police!

16:21.689 --> 16:24.441
Damn, that scared me. What's her problem?

16:32.324 --> 16:35.536
Okay. Want to hear what happens
if you keep shooting like that?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.123
Jang Ha-ri, stand up.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.291
Yes, sir.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.587
Take a good look.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.090
She's your future.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.801
She's a senior,

16:52.136 --> 16:54.304
but she hasn't won a single gold medal.

16:54.388 --> 16:58.058
Forget making the national team.
She can't even make the reserve team.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.352
She couldn't even pass
the regional qualifiers today.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.938
What will you grow up to be?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.943
You can't get into college.
You can't get onto a corporate team.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.446
You didn't study, so no shot
at the civil service exam either.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.159
Listen up.
Do you know how cruel this field is?

17:16.201 --> 17:19.496
All kids who study that score
in the top 100 get into Seoul University.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.291
But even if you guys get into the top 100,

17:23.125 --> 17:25.377
you can't get anywhere near the Olympics.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.087
You're just garbage.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.214
Your life is screwed. Got it?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.009
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

17:36.180 --> 17:37.514
That crazy bastard.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.563
What the hell are they doing?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.487
-See if it's there.
-It's not here either.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.529
Hey, Joon-yeong!

17:52.613 --> 17:54.698
I'm telling you. They can't open doors.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.909
Let's hold it shut for now.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.036
-Did you find one?
-No, nothing here.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.788
-Damn it.
-Any luck, Dae-su?

18:00.871 --> 18:01.789
Are you okay?

18:02.539 --> 18:03.499
Look over there.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.212
-I don't see any here.
-Here!

18:09.379 --> 18:10.297
I found one!

18:13.717 --> 18:14.927
Whose is it?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.512
This is Yeong-ju's desk.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.971
Oh no. We need the passcode.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.557
Do something.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.392
I just said we need the passcode!

18:22.893 --> 18:24.520
Maybe it's her birthday.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.105
When's her birthday?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.440
I don't know.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.237
She's there. Give it to me.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.287
SWIPE UP FOR FACE ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

18:46.834 --> 18:48.293
Hold it closer.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.386
You don't need to unlock it
to make emergency calls.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.516
AT THE SCENE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

19:06.145 --> 19:08.522
-Police. What's your emergency?
-Hello?

19:08.605 --> 19:10.149
I'm at Hyosan High School.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.110
Zombies showed up.
Everyone turned into zombies.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.611
You can't say "zombies."

19:14.695 --> 19:16.155
Then what?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.781
They won't believe you.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.617
They're not exactly zombies,
but they're something like that.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.452
Okay. Hyosan High, zombies.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.247
Please state your name and number.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.749
You know there's a fine
for making false reports, right?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.501
This isn't a prank.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.253
Everyone's…

19:32.713 --> 19:33.881
Anyway, come quick.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.090
Okay.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.718
Lee Cheong-san.

19:37.801 --> 19:41.430
Your number is 010-4362…

19:41.513 --> 19:44.224
Stay somewhere safe so you don't get bit.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.059
We'll head out right away.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.730
These fucking brats.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.774
He says zombies are attacking.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.151
Hyosan High, right?

19:55.068 --> 19:56.737
They must be having a festival.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.947
I just got a call about zombies too.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.033
-Students, right?
-Police. What's your emergency?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.327
A patient is attacking people?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.330
Does the person have a knife
or some other weapon?

20:07.414 --> 20:08.540
She's biting them?

20:09.416 --> 20:10.918
Zombie?

20:11.752 --> 20:13.670
Hey. Call the school and check.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.713
Okay.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.299
Police. What's your emergency?

20:17.799 --> 20:21.011
-What? A person is biting people?
-Police. What's your emergency?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.933

CLASS MOTTO
SUN-HWA IS WATCHING

20:29.519 --> 20:30.729
Stay away!

20:33.315 --> 20:34.233
What?

20:34.816 --> 20:36.944
-Where are they going?
-Why are they leaving?

20:41.114 --> 20:42.991
-What are you doing, moron? Close it.
-Okay.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.952
You scared me.

20:45.035 --> 20:45.911
Are they coming?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.080
He said they'll come.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.790
Did they believe you?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.876
What if they think it's a prank call
and don't come?

20:53.961 --> 20:55.087
Call again.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.631
-Tell them to come quick!
-Stop yelling.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.549
What if the zombies come back?

20:59.633 --> 21:00.509
Give me that.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.604
-You've reached the fire department.
-Hello.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.107
Do you know Capt. Nam So-ju
from Rescue Team One?

21:15.732 --> 21:17.609
No. We have many firefighters.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.735
What is this about?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.947
Oh. Capt. Nam So-ju is my dad.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.491
Please tell him
to hurry over to my school.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.243
-Who is it?
-This is the call center.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.996
You should call his station
if you want to reach him.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.622
There's a fire.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.582
-Fire?
-Hyosan High School, classroom 2-5.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.293
The fire is huge.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.980
GYEONGGI PROVINCIAL FIRE DEPARTMENT

HYOSAN FIRE STATION

RESCUE

22:19.671 --> 22:20.922
No one's coming, right?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.593
Something's going on at the gate.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.055
Let's call the cops again.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.639
They're not coming.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.184
I'm trying but they won't pick up.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.731
Hey.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.983
Do something.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.361
Tell Ms. Park to come or something.

22:44.905 --> 22:45.947
Do something.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.199
What can she do?

22:48.075 --> 22:49.576
She should be doing something.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.497
What have you done
as our classroom president?

22:53.580 --> 22:54.414
Stop it.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.638
Should I go out?
Go to the teachers' office? Will that do?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.558
Why are you asking me?

23:14.559 --> 23:15.811
You said to do something.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.896
Isn't that what you meant?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.731
Stop it, both of you.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.151
She's saying that
because you're our classroom president.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.822
-Right. You're the classroom president.
-So just be patient, okay?

23:29.991 --> 23:32.702
You guys are… funny.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.703
What do you mean?

23:38.917 --> 23:42.337
Now that we're in this mess,
I'm your classroom president?

23:45.674 --> 23:48.385
We called the police
so we just have to wait a little while.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.762
But no one's coming!

23:50.846 --> 23:52.222
Stop it. We're all scared too.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.224
That's why I'm telling them to call!

23:54.307 --> 23:55.934
You do it, then!

23:56.017 --> 23:58.353
Hey, guys. Stop fighting.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.689
Who are you to stop us, you fucker?

24:00.772 --> 24:02.524
What? Fucker?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.985
Did you just call me a fucker? Fuck!

24:05.068 --> 24:07.070
-Hey. Stop it.
-Hey, Gyeong-su.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.613
Gyeong-su, let it go.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.739
Stop it.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.033
Hold the door. I said, hold the door.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.327
Who the hell does she think…

24:14.411 --> 24:15.912
-Please stop.
-Forget the door.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.874
-Did you hear what she said?
-Gyeong-su. Hold the door.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.750
Let it go. It's nothing new.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.085
Enough already. I'm going.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.463
-Block it.
-Fine. Seriously--

24:29.551 --> 24:30.552
Mr. Kang.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.639
Are you guys okay?

24:40.395 --> 24:42.606
What about you? You weren't bit?

24:42.689 --> 24:45.775
No. Of course not. I'm fine.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.279
Hey, guys. Let's barricade the door first.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.407
Get moving. Hurry.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.451
It's okay. We are safe. Let's move this.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.494
Like this?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.412
Yes. Stack them high.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.914
High.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.584
You called the cops, right?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.211
We can leave soon, right?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.128
Yes.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.923
What are you doing?
Block the front door and stack it.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.341
Stack it high. High.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.343
Here.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.803
-Stack it high.
-Higher?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.264
Push it closer. Much closer.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.518
On-jo, what do we do?

25:19.601 --> 25:20.560
What?

25:21.561 --> 25:22.437
Look.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.980
His arm.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.361
Mr. Kang.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.071
Your arm.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.572
What are you doing? Block the door.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.910
-You were bitten on your arm!
-What?

25:40.664 --> 25:41.790
What is it?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.041
This isn't a bite.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.752
-He said he wasn't bit.
-No.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.504
I wasn't bit.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.256
It's a bite mark.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.966
I said it isn't. Don't talk back to me.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.968
Were you really bit?

25:53.051 --> 25:55.512
I wasn't!
How many times do I have to tell you?

25:55.595 --> 25:58.306
Then why are you hiding it?
Just show it to us.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.978
Can you please leave?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.772
-What?
-Get out.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.567
You want me to go out there?

26:09.317 --> 26:12.195
After all I did to get here?
You want me to go back out?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.738
You were bit.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.532
Get out.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.160
Get out!

26:19.244 --> 26:20.412
You fucking bitch!

26:21.830 --> 26:23.248
How dare you yell at a teacher?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.333
You little…

26:25.959 --> 26:26.876
Get over here.

26:27.877 --> 26:28.712
Come here.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.880
Come here!

26:32.799 --> 26:34.551
You won't come? Hey.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.011
Hey.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.513
-Stop. Stop it.
-He was bit.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.640
-Wait.
-Stay back.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.767
-Hey, look.
-Let go.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.698
-Are you out of your mind?
-Watch out!

26:58.325 --> 26:59.409
Damn.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.163
-Hey. I think he really was bit.
-Shouldn't we get out of here?

27:03.246 --> 27:04.789
Hey. He's turning.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.418
Get him out of here! Hurry!

27:09.169 --> 27:10.629
Hurry. Throw him out.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
-Min-ji!
-Dae-su, wait!

27:18.470 --> 27:19.512
Do something!

27:20.680 --> 27:22.349
No! Dae-su!

27:33.109 --> 27:34.277
Min-ji…

27:36.905 --> 27:37.822
Dae-su.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.408
What do I do?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.619
I don't want to die.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.210
Hurry. Get him out of here!

28:05.975 --> 28:06.935
Cheong-san!

28:11.189 --> 28:12.482
I don't want to die.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.858
Help me.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.797
Stay away.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.216
Get away from me. Get away!

28:57.777 --> 29:01.197
Stop, Min-ji. Snap out of it. Please.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.449
We have to get out.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.494
Get out!

29:07.495 --> 29:08.747
-Get out!
-Let's go!

29:08.830 --> 29:10.165
Cheong-san! Dae-su!

29:13.334 --> 29:14.461
Hurry!

29:16.713 --> 29:17.547
Hurry!

29:18.590 --> 29:19.507
Get out!

29:19.591 --> 29:20.508
Gyeong-su!

30:20.777 --> 30:22.111
Watch your hands!

30:26.699 --> 30:28.660
Hey! Get out of the way!

31:01.150 --> 31:02.068
Get over here!

31:07.323 --> 31:08.700
-Push it!
-Push. More!

31:08.783 --> 31:09.826
Let's go!

31:11.202 --> 31:12.203
We need to turn!

31:13.413 --> 31:14.747
Push!

31:19.669 --> 31:20.920
Run upstairs!

31:21.754 --> 31:22.672
Let's go!

31:28.052 --> 31:28.970
Hurry up!

31:40.023 --> 31:41.524
No! We have to go up!

31:43.192 --> 31:45.028
Hurry up! Go up!

32:00.001 --> 32:01.169
Su-hyeok!

32:01.252 --> 32:02.378
Go to the science lab!

32:03.171 --> 32:04.297
Hurry!

32:15.683 --> 32:16.559
Dae-su! Behind you!

32:22.273 --> 32:23.483
Help me. Help!

32:24.567 --> 32:25.443
Push!

32:26.486 --> 32:27.654
Push!

32:30.448 --> 32:32.617
-Push!
-Harder!

32:34.118 --> 32:36.913
-It's locked. Somewhere else!
-Where? We're surrounded!

32:36.996 --> 32:39.457
-It's locked!
-Shit! What now?

32:41.584 --> 32:42.877
Try to open it!

32:42.961 --> 32:44.462
Can't you see it's locked?

32:44.545 --> 32:45.588
Hey, block that gap!

32:46.214 --> 32:47.090
Dae-su, push!

32:47.840 --> 32:48.883
Push!

33:01.479 --> 33:03.106
Watch your hands! Careful!

33:05.400 --> 33:06.651
Why's it taking so long?

33:06.734 --> 33:07.860
Hey!

33:10.863 --> 33:13.074
-Above you!
-Hey, it's climbing over!

33:16.619 --> 33:19.205
Fuck! I can't hold them off
much longer. Hurry!

33:19.288 --> 33:20.415
Hurry!

33:20.498 --> 33:21.624
It's open!

33:22.959 --> 33:24.127
Push!

33:24.711 --> 33:25.837
Push!

33:30.008 --> 33:31.134
Hurry! Get inside!

33:35.680 --> 33:36.806
Hurry!

33:58.369 --> 33:59.412
Fuck.

34:00.788 --> 34:01.622
Fuck!

34:25.938 --> 34:27.148
Move the desks!

34:29.692 --> 34:30.902
Block it!

34:33.780 --> 34:35.573
Fuck! That scared the hell out of me.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.783
Block it.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.884
Where's the phone? I'll try calling again.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.594
I dropped it.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.721
How could you lose it?

34:59.388 --> 35:01.724
Who cares about that right now?
This is more urgent.

35:03.392 --> 35:04.852
Who are you to butt in?

35:07.021 --> 35:09.649
-What?
-It's because you didn't hold the door.

35:09.732 --> 35:12.610
If you had,
the gym teacher wouldn't have gotten in.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.362
We almost died because of you.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.572
Then maybe you should have held the door.

35:17.406 --> 35:18.741
You're a fucking asshole.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.034
Gyeong-su.

35:20.743 --> 35:23.079
-You bitch.
-How dare you touch me?

35:23.162 --> 35:26.415
Fight after you move these.
This isn't the time.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.042
She's right. Stop it.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.336
Fight after we finish this, Gyeong-su.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.841
This is so annoying.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.858
Where's Su-hyeok?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.193
Has anyone seen him?

35:56.779 --> 35:58.114
You were with him.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.909
He was behind me, but…

36:01.993 --> 36:03.327
Then where is he?

36:06.664 --> 36:07.707
I don't know.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.419
Oh no.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.322
They've all turned.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.701
I think everyone except us turned.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.329
We're outcasts again.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
And this is still hell.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.800
I hope everyone dies.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.303
Every single one of them.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.686
You. Shut your mouth.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.349
We should stay here a bit longer.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.226
Right. Okay.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.895
Do you think they're gone?

37:52.979 --> 37:55.564
What do we do?
Shouldn't we go out and call the cops?

37:55.648 --> 37:56.691
We can't go out now.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.943
I'm sure they're still out there.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.157
Who's smoking in this situation?

38:05.825 --> 38:08.452
Who are you to hide in the girls' room?

38:09.245 --> 38:11.289
Be a man. Wimp.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.499
Why, you… Who are you?

38:14.250 --> 38:16.836
Leave her alone. It's Mi-jin.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.796
Mi-jin? Park Mi-jin?

38:18.879 --> 38:19.755
Yes.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.008
Joon-seong.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.260
I'm really dizzy.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.470
Is it bad?

38:27.346 --> 38:29.974
-What do we do?
-I don't know. It's weird.

38:31.058 --> 38:34.312
Everything sounds muffled, and I'm dizzy.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.648
Ha-lim, it's probably just from the shock.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.651
Let's go to the hospital
once things calm down outside, okay?

38:40.735 --> 38:41.694
Okay.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.572
What is it? Who is it?

38:44.655 --> 38:45.740
Hey, open up.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.202
-Open up. Now!
-Why, you--

38:50.286 --> 38:51.662
-Get out.
-What are you doing?

38:51.746 --> 38:52.997
Don't move.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.749
What's wrong?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.007
-What are you doing?
-Fuck, let go of me.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.383
Mi-jin.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.594
Listen carefully.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.889
You know how to play tag, right?

39:10.639 --> 39:14.435
We're all hiding here
to get away from someone.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.978
But now…

39:19.648 --> 39:21.025
you're it.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.559
What are you doing? Hold the door.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.311
But Ha-lim…

39:57.853 --> 40:00.356
I told you she was bit. Get over here.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.901
Mi-jin, don't do this.

40:04.985 --> 40:05.820
I'm okay.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.322
Let me out.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.866
Be quiet, you zombie bitch.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.243
Joon-seong, don't do this.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.619
Let me out.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.873
We came here together.
I saved you, remember?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.128
If you let her out, we all die.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.470
Shit.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.474
Get it together. Look up.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.393
What do you want from me?

40:37.476 --> 40:40.146
-If she turns, we have to kill her.
-Kill Ha-lim?

40:40.229 --> 40:43.357
She's not Ha-lim. She's a zombie.

40:44.692 --> 40:45.693
But still,

40:45.776 --> 40:48.028
do we have any other options?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.282
I don't know.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.995
Mi-jin. I can hear you.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.288
I know.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.458
Must you do that if you know?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.876
You're going to turn eventually.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.922
I know. But,

41:08.507 --> 41:10.885
I'm going to kill you first.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.221
I'll kill you before I kill anyone else.

41:15.347 --> 41:16.432
Crazy bitch.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.145
Mi-jin.

41:23.230 --> 41:24.773
I'm so scared--

41:43.459 --> 41:44.585
Get ready.

41:45.961 --> 41:47.171
I said to get ready.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.380
For what?

41:49.089 --> 41:50.132
To kill her.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.389
Are you going to hold it forever?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.451
Damn it.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.869
What are you doing?

42:23.290 --> 42:25.543
Hey. Why won't she die?

42:25.626 --> 42:27.461
I don't know. Maybe this isn't the spot.

42:35.010 --> 42:35.886
What…

42:41.433 --> 42:42.768
Don't. We're human.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.105
We're not zombies, you bitch.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.067
Hey, I think they're okay.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.193
Zombies don't curse.

42:52.194 --> 42:53.112
Shoot if they turn.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.490
You crazy bitch. We're not zombies!

42:59.493 --> 43:02.454
Students and teachers
of Hyosan High School.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.540
I'm Park Sun-hwa, the English teacher.

43:05.165 --> 43:09.128
Something strange is happening
throughout the school.

43:09.920 --> 43:14.049
Some students are attacking people
indiscriminately,

43:14.133 --> 43:17.011
so please find a safe place
and take shelter.

43:18.053 --> 43:21.724
And if any student
or faculty hears this and is able,

43:21.807 --> 43:24.518
please call the police
and the fire department.

43:26.478 --> 43:30.649
Students, hide somewhere safe
until help arrives.

43:31.734 --> 43:34.361
If you can get out of the school,

43:34.445 --> 43:36.322
please get out.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.657
I repeat.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.452
Some students are…

43:52.796 --> 43:53.964
Guys.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.676
You're okay, right?

43:58.302 --> 43:59.678
You're not hurt, right?

44:01.722 --> 44:02.765
I don't know

44:03.766 --> 44:06.894
what's going on or why this is happening.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.396
Still,

44:09.480 --> 44:11.523
find a safe place and hide.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.241
I'm sorry

44:22.618 --> 44:23.786
I can't be of any help.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.791
Don't get hurt, okay?

44:30.125 --> 44:33.504
Let's stay alive and meet again.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.130
Okay?

44:46.058 --> 44:48.477
Rescue Team Three,
head to Hyosan Hospital.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.522
Rescue Team Four, head to
the accident at Hyosan Intersection.

44:51.605 --> 44:53.440
Rescue Team Two, you have another call.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.901
Fire at Hyosan High.
Please head there right away.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.320
Rescue Team One, report location.

44:59.154 --> 45:01.615
This is Rescue Team One.
We've arrived at the accident.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.369
This is Rescue Team Two. We'll head
to the fire at Hyosan High School.

45:06.161 --> 45:09.498
Accident reports keep coming in.
All units standby where you are.

45:34.898 --> 45:35.941
Let's go.

45:49.872 --> 45:50.831
You little shit!

45:51.790 --> 45:53.208
-What was that for?
-A fly.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.593
You heard from On-jo earlier, right?

46:03.260 --> 46:04.887
She confessed to Su-hyeok.

46:06.138 --> 46:06.972
So what?

46:07.931 --> 46:09.892
Go and comfort her.

46:10.726 --> 46:12.394
I keep trying, but it won't work.

46:13.353 --> 46:14.855
Forget it. You do it.

46:15.647 --> 46:17.232
Why are you snapping at me?

46:17.775 --> 46:20.944
What's it to me whom she likes?

46:23.906 --> 46:24.823
Forget it.

46:34.666 --> 46:35.584
On-jo.

46:36.335 --> 46:37.669
Don't worry too much.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.298
I'm sure Su-hyeok will be fine.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.134
He's athletic and super fast.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.180
Right.

46:56.730 --> 46:57.648
But

46:58.690 --> 47:00.025
Cheong-san's acting weird.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.736
He's super irritable.

47:03.695 --> 47:07.908
I think he likes you.

47:08.408 --> 47:09.660
I can totally tell.

47:10.452 --> 47:13.747
No, he doesn't.
He doesn't feel things like that.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.125
He's too busy teasing me.

47:29.888 --> 47:30.973
I-sak.

47:32.432 --> 47:33.642
Why are you so cold?

47:34.393 --> 47:35.269
What?

47:38.772 --> 47:40.190
Your hand is really…

47:44.319 --> 47:45.362
What about my hand?

47:55.622 --> 47:56.456
I-sak.

47:57.291 --> 48:00.794
-What's wrong? Are you--
-No, I wasn't bit. Really.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.424
I mean it. I really wasn't.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.635
She was bit.

48:13.181 --> 48:14.558
What's going on?

48:16.101 --> 48:17.060
Were you bit?

48:17.144 --> 48:18.312
No, I wasn't!

48:21.607 --> 48:24.443
Hey. You're okay, right?

48:35.370 --> 48:36.204
On-jo.

48:37.748 --> 48:38.624
I-sak.

48:47.633 --> 48:48.842
No, right?

48:49.927 --> 48:51.219
I'm not like them, right?

48:58.477 --> 48:59.519
I'm not.

49:00.437 --> 49:01.647
I'm not one of them.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.698
What are you guys doing?
Get her out of here!

49:11.782 --> 49:13.283
Get her out now!

49:14.201 --> 49:15.994
Shit. They're going to climb over.

49:16.995 --> 49:17.871
No.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.165
I'm fine!

49:31.134 --> 49:32.177
On-jo.

49:33.428 --> 49:34.680
Let go.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.061
Hurry! Do something!

49:42.229 --> 49:43.522
Throw her out the window.

49:44.439 --> 49:46.358
No. Let go.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.485
Hurry! She's turning into a zombie!

49:51.488 --> 49:52.614
No, not I-sak.

50:08.088 --> 50:09.339
I-sak.

50:10.632 --> 50:12.718
I-sak, don't.

50:17.055 --> 50:17.973
Stop it!

50:19.683 --> 50:20.642
I said, stop it!

50:24.813 --> 50:25.897
Cheong-san!

50:37.034 --> 50:38.285
Have you lost your mind?

50:38.785 --> 50:40.328
-Let go.
-I-sak.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.496
You have to let go.

50:54.384 --> 50:55.719
You want some glitter?

50:56.970 --> 50:58.972
-It's okay. I can do it.
-Go on.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.182
I'll do it for you.

51:02.517 --> 51:03.435
It's nice. Look.

51:12.944 --> 51:14.237
It looks great on you!

51:45.185 --> 51:46.228
Hey!

52:48.957 --> 52:49.875
On-jo.

53:11.062 --> 53:12.355
Come hold this!

54:23.969 --> 54:24.928
Let's go out.

54:25.971 --> 54:27.430
We can't last here much longer.

54:27.514 --> 54:28.598
Where would we go? And how?

54:29.474 --> 54:30.892
The rope from earlier.

54:30.976 --> 54:31.893
Gyeong-su.

54:33.061 --> 54:33.979
Yes?

54:36.064 --> 54:37.107
What?

54:39.442 --> 54:40.610
What is it?

54:40.694 --> 54:43.446
Open it just a little.
Enough for the hose to fit.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.699
Isn't it better to wait
until the rescuers come?

54:45.782 --> 54:47.284
We could all die if we wait.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.411
This might kill us faster. If we--

54:49.494 --> 54:51.705
Is waiting for someone
the best thing we can do?

54:53.039 --> 54:54.207
Screw it.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.835
I've never given my best
at anything other than playing.

55:46.926 --> 55:47.844
Did you get it?

55:48.386 --> 55:49.637
Where are you going?

56:34.557 --> 56:35.809
Prez, hold the door.

56:43.733 --> 56:44.734
Help me make knots.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.444
How?

56:46.528 --> 56:50.573
Wrap it and tie it.
So a hand or foot can fit.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.033
Big enough for a foot?

56:52.117 --> 56:55.370
Zigzag. Tie them in a zigzag.
In 50-centimeter increments.

56:55.453 --> 56:57.580
-Zigzag.
-Is this right?

56:58.164 --> 56:59.124
Move over.

57:02.252 --> 57:03.211
Good enough, right?

57:07.090 --> 57:08.174
Let's go.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.019
Can we make it?

57:20.687 --> 57:23.356
I'll go down and check the empty rooms.
Come when I tell you to.

57:25.024 --> 57:25.984
Be careful.

57:27.527 --> 57:28.403
Hold it.

57:30.530 --> 57:31.489
What are you doing?

57:34.075 --> 57:35.076
What are you doing?

57:36.786 --> 57:37.745
Go down.

57:40.623 --> 57:41.583
What?

57:42.709 --> 57:43.585
Gyeong-su,

57:44.252 --> 57:45.170
you go first.

57:45.253 --> 57:46.921
Why? Did you see something?

57:47.005 --> 57:48.756
No. You go.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.800
What's down there?

57:51.342 --> 57:52.427
Just go.

57:52.510 --> 57:53.887
You go, then.

57:53.970 --> 57:55.263
-Go already.
-Step up there.

57:55.346 --> 57:56.306
You should go.

57:56.389 --> 57:57.640
Then you go, asshole.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.017
No. You can do it.

57:59.100 --> 58:01.019
-You can do it.
-Damn it.

58:02.145 --> 58:03.605
But why am I--

58:03.688 --> 58:04.856
Grab it and go.

58:06.608 --> 58:07.984
Rock, paper, scissors?

58:08.067 --> 58:09.652
-Just go.
-I mean…

58:10.153 --> 58:12.697
-Don't be a wimp.
-Hey. Hold on.

58:13.281 --> 58:14.491
Where is it? Hold on.

58:14.574 --> 58:16.201
-Can you reach it?
-Wait, I can't.

58:16.284 --> 58:17.202
Put your foot in.

58:17.285 --> 58:18.495
Oh, I got it.

58:19.245 --> 58:20.121
Careful.

58:32.759 --> 58:34.511
Damn it. Where is it?

58:46.731 --> 58:48.650
Shit. You scared me.

58:49.651 --> 58:50.944
Damn it.

58:53.988 --> 58:55.198
I'll keep going.

59:11.297 --> 59:12.507
I want to go down first.

59:13.591 --> 59:16.511
One person at a time.
You might fall if it shakes too much.

59:16.594 --> 59:18.179
I won't shake it.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.808
-How long do I have to wait?
-Just a little while.

59:28.815 --> 59:30.108
Shit. Why won't it come out?

59:32.652 --> 59:34.696
Gyeong-su!

59:34.779 --> 59:35.822
Ms. Park!

59:35.905 --> 59:37.156
Gyeong-su!

59:37.240 --> 59:39.075
-Are you okay?
-Hurry.

59:39.158 --> 59:40.785
-Be careful.
-Oh, right.

59:41.744 --> 59:42.620
Cheong-san!

59:42.704 --> 59:44.289
Ms. Park is here!

59:44.998 --> 59:46.374
Ms. Park is on the second floor.

59:46.874 --> 59:48.543
Second floor? The broadcasting room?

59:48.626 --> 59:50.587
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.213
Were you with the others?

59:52.297 --> 59:54.882
They're in the science lab.
They'll come down now.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.968
Come down! Okay?

59:57.760 --> 59:58.970
Come down!

59:59.053 --> 1:00:00.221
Seriously!

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:02.390
What?

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:06.102
Careful. I got you. Hold on.

1:00:07.854 --> 1:00:09.647
-Dae-su.
-You're so heavy.

1:00:09.731 --> 1:00:11.941
-Dae-su.
-Ms. Park.

1:00:13.526 --> 1:00:14.694
Come down safely.

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:30.835
Grab the window frame.

1:00:31.336 --> 1:00:32.837
-Grab her.
-Let go.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:34.881
-I have a cramp!
-You okay?

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:36.174
What's wrong?

1:00:36.257 --> 1:00:37.634
Straighten your knee.

1:00:37.717 --> 1:00:39.510
-Not my legs!
-Watch out for your neck!

1:00:39.594 --> 1:00:42.347
Good. You did great.

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:12.085
Go down.

1:01:16.172 --> 1:01:17.006
I-sak…

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:18.549
Get it together.

1:01:19.634 --> 1:01:21.928
Who here hasn't lost a friend?

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:24.180
Think of all the people who died.
Why are you…

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.599
There's no one left that I like.

1:01:30.144 --> 1:01:33.606
There are people who like you though.

1:01:34.899 --> 1:01:36.067
Like your dad and…

1:01:40.321 --> 1:01:42.657
You have to live for them.

1:01:49.414 --> 1:01:50.581
Let's go.

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.772
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
NAM-RA

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:49.223
Oh shit.

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:17.794
Hurry.

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:18.711
Hurry up.

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:20.213
Grab her. Okay.

1:03:22.548 --> 1:03:23.549
Careful.

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:50.608
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

1:07:50.691 --> 1:07:53.527
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
