13:30.609 --> 13:32.392
Or let me loose

13:32.444 --> 13:35.645
and I'll take you straight to Eretria.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.647
Do you swear you know where she is?

13:37.733 --> 13:40.233
Cross my cold, black heart.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.901
And I always keep my word.

13:43.905 --> 13:46.740
You can't be serious?

13:46.792 --> 13:48.541
You think this is some coincidence?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.543
He's probably been
tracking us for hours.

13:52.214 --> 13:54.581
About a day now.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.083
Can you really blame me?

13:57.135 --> 13:59.719
After seeing what those
Elfstones of yours can do?

14:01.473 --> 14:02.839
If we set him free,

14:02.924 --> 14:04.224
then we deserve whatever
it is he does to us.

14:04.259 --> 14:06.092
Wil, if you have a
better idea, short of us

14:06.144 --> 14:07.677
wandering through Troll
territory all night,

14:07.763 --> 14:10.063
I'm all ears.

14:10.098 --> 14:13.733
She certainly is.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.819
Clearly we can't trust him.

14:15.904 --> 14:17.320
But with someone who
actually knows these woods,

14:17.406 --> 14:19.189
we actually stand a chance
of finding Eretria.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.950
We were taught Humans were warmongers,

14:31.036 --> 14:34.788
intent on destroying the world.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.790
But Human-kind was more than that.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
It was curious and compassionate,

14:39.628 --> 14:41.428
brilliant even.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.129
I mean, we built great glass cites

14:43.215 --> 14:46.549
and machines that allowed
us to travel to the stars.

14:48.553 --> 14:51.054
Sounds like a bedtime story.

14:51.139 --> 14:53.723
No, that is what the Elves
want us to believe.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.609
What you see here is the
first of many colonies,

14:56.645 --> 14:58.478
Human colonies, all coming together

14:58.530 --> 15:01.481
to usher in a new era of man.

15:01.566 --> 15:04.234
Human, Troll, Elf, Gnome.

15:04.319 --> 15:06.152
They're all animals.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.987
And reading books and baking pies

15:08.040 --> 15:10.206
isn't gonna keep anyone safe.

15:10.292 --> 15:13.293
Yeah, you're right.

15:13.328 --> 15:14.744
Follow me.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.552
So, when we settled here,

15:22.637 --> 15:24.003
we were overrun by Trolls.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.589
We lost half our people
in the first night.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.674
Women, children.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.142
It was a bloodletting.

15:29.177 --> 15:30.677
Then why stay?

15:30.762 --> 15:32.512
I was tired of running.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.347
And I saw a future here.

15:34.399 --> 15:36.182
One that could be negotiated.

15:36.234 --> 15:37.901
With the Trolls?

15:37.986 --> 15:41.187
Well, our truce is tentative at best.

15:41.273 --> 15:44.774
Keeping us alive requires
more than just... hope.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.831
What is it?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.867
They called it a gun.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.369
I bought a couple off an old tracker.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.838
Cost me an entire harvest of corn.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.123
(gun cocking)

16:06.014 --> 16:07.964
It was worth every kernel.

16:08.049 --> 16:09.349
Here.

16:14.856 --> 16:18.358
Now, pull that hammer back,

16:18.393 --> 16:21.561
focus on the little line.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.863
Point it straight at the target

16:23.899 --> 16:26.983
and, uh... squeeze.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.384
Well...

16:44.419 --> 16:45.885
if I had ten of you around,

16:45.921 --> 16:48.171
those Trolls would not stand a chance.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.931
Cross us again...

16:57.983 --> 17:00.099
and I'll gut you like
the pig that you are.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.784
Looks like we have a deal.

17:22.257 --> 17:24.174
What's so special about this map?

17:24.259 --> 17:25.842
Apparently, the key to saving the world

17:25.926 --> 17:28.928
from Demons lies there, in Safehold.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.263
Look, I know it sounds crazy

17:30.298 --> 17:31.714
but if you'd seen half
of what I've seen,

17:31.800 --> 17:32.765
you'd believe me.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.933
It doesn't sound crazy.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.052
No more than man landing on the moon.

17:36.137 --> 17:39.472
Like that really happened.

17:39.524 --> 17:42.475
Look, all I wanted was
my life to be my own.

17:42.527 --> 17:44.561
To be free.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.146
Turns out "fate" has a
twisted sense of humor.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.451
I need to find my friends.

17:51.486 --> 17:54.153
And when I do, we need
to get to Safehold.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.828
Well, I've sent trackers
to the Old World.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.715
And this, uh, map of yours?

18:05.800 --> 18:08.718
I've lost three men in that same spot.

18:08.803 --> 18:10.470

18:14.759 --> 18:17.260

29:28.066 --> 29:29.682
it doesn't appear you need saving.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.984
You're right, I don't.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.435
I'm okay.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.938

29:34.990 --> 29:36.406
Seriously?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.525
Did you forget what we're
supposed to be doing?

29:38.610 --> 29:39.742
Forget?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.110
How could I forget?

29:41.163 --> 29:42.579
You and Amberle have been telling me

29:42.614 --> 29:45.281
what to do ever since we left Arborlon.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.001
Maybe I'm done with that.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.836
Done?

29:49.921 --> 29:52.255
Yeah, I want to lead my own life.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.624
You won't have a life if
we don't get to Safehold.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.125

Okay, we need to get out of here now.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.764
She's right.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.467
She's always right, isn't she?

30:04.553 --> 30:05.518

30:05.604 --> 30:06.936
Well, when it comes to this quest,

30:06.972 --> 30:08.805
you two have made your choice.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.224
But I didn't.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.976
I've done my part.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.228

I was in this just to earn some coin.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.127
No, you weren't. Eretria...

30:31.162 --> 30:32.912
You came here for the map.

30:32.998 --> 30:33.963
Not for me.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.833
What map?

30:36.885 --> 30:38.585
The map to Safehold.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.339
Now, why don't you
fill your boyfriend in

30:46.177 --> 30:48.394
I'll meet you outside in five minutes.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.730
And if we refuse to leave?

30:50.815 --> 30:53.349

Human in here about you.
