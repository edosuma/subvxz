00:02.726 --> 00:05.307
Hey. Good morning, beautiful.

00:05.308 --> 00:06.462
Hi, baby.

00:06.463 --> 00:08.464
I got you a present.

00:08.465 --> 00:10.800
Oh, my God. Wow.

00:10.801 --> 00:13.837
- Danny Castellano, good morning.
- Morning.

00:13.838 --> 00:15.938
Oh, my God!
Why did you give me a cockroach?

00:15.939 --> 00:17.923
No, it's not a cockroach,
it's a date.

00:17.924 --> 00:20.412
Oh, fruit! You know I hate fruit!
What's wrong with you?

00:20.413 --> 00:21.744
Okay, stop!

00:21.745 --> 00:23.012
Oh, God,
it's my living nightmare.

00:23.013 --> 00:25.581
Hey. Okay, look look,
that was just my way of saying

00:25.582 --> 00:28.484
I wanna set a date
for our wedding.

00:28.485 --> 00:29.379
Oh.

00:29.380 --> 00:31.354
Yeah, I was doing
my weekly dry fruit run...

00:31.355 --> 00:32.755
[snaps] And it just came to me.

00:32.756 --> 00:34.256
I'm tired of living in sin.

00:34.257 --> 00:36.659
Oh, please,
we're like God's favorite porno.

00:36.660 --> 00:37.760
Well.

00:37.761 --> 00:38.761
Okay, well why now?

00:38.762 --> 00:40.763
Well, when I was
taking care of my dad,

00:40.764 --> 00:43.432
the only thing that got me through
was thinking about you and Leo.

00:43.433 --> 00:45.103
Oh, sweetheart.

00:45.104 --> 00:47.436
- I love you.
- I'm so excited.

00:47.437 --> 00:51.507
Hey, to celebrate our matrimony,
how about a little mattress-mony?

00:51.508 --> 00:52.908
- No, baby.
- What?

00:52.909 --> 00:54.176
- There's no time.
- There's not?

00:54.177 --> 00:55.544
No, we have to find
a wedding location.

00:55.545 --> 00:57.413
[sighs] And it can't be
anywhere in Central Park,

00:57.414 --> 01:00.316
because I fit the description of
that flasher they never caught.

01:00.317 --> 01:02.585
Babe, I'd marry you in a gutter.

01:02.586 --> 01:05.453
Aw. That is the sweetest
and worst thing

01:05.455 --> 01:06.956
that anyone has ever said to me.

01:06.957 --> 01:10.459
Now, go get your checkbook, 'cause
this bitch gon' be expensive.

Hey, guys, I'm so glad
you could join us tonight.

01:20.103 --> 01:24.006
Um, Richie, congratulations,
I have selected you

01:24.007 --> 01:26.108
to be one of
my bridesmaids at our wedding.

01:26.109 --> 01:28.277
Yeah, boy.

01:28.278 --> 01:29.645
That's a little offensive,
don't you think?

01:29.646 --> 01:31.681
If anything,
I should be the Maid of Honor.

01:31.682 --> 01:34.150
It's not like you have
any female friends, Mindy.

01:34.151 --> 01:35.351
- He's right.
- I don't know.

01:35.352 --> 01:36.986
Come on, Richie,
you gotta be a bridesmaid,

01:36.987 --> 01:38.948
'cause Rishi,
we'd like you to be a groomsman.

01:38.949 --> 01:41.757
Oh, no, Mindy,
I am not gonna be a groomsman

01:41.758 --> 01:43.025
at some honky's wedding,
all right?

01:43.026 --> 01:45.061
- Hey!
- Look, I'm the DJ.

You know what, I apologize.
You need to be doing that.

01:54.173 --> 01:55.905
You know how I do.

01:55.906 --> 02:00.553
Well, Mindy, I took the liberty of...
designing your invitations!

02:00.554 --> 02:02.678
On my computer, of course.

02:02.679 --> 02:05.350
The theme is: Very Religious.

Cool, okay. [clears throat]

02:14.825 --> 02:16.592
Ma, you didn't use all
my confirmation names.

02:16.593 --> 02:18.027
Oh, they wouldn't fit.

02:18.028 --> 02:21.630
Hey, I love this, in theory,
but I actually already finished

02:21.631 --> 02:23.284
designing the invitations
to the wedding.

02:23.285 --> 02:25.768
They're silk.

02:25.769 --> 02:27.737
Ma, what are you doing? Ma.

02:27.738 --> 02:30.039
Okay, you know what, Annette,
we can use your invitation,

02:30.040 --> 02:31.974
but, for God's sakes,
put my name on it, okay?

02:31.975 --> 02:33.211
Really, Mindy?

02:33.212 --> 02:35.377
Yeah. It's fine.
I mean, everyone knows

02:35.378 --> 02:37.257
that the wedding is just
about the dress, anyway.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.468
Exactly! Which is why
I made an appointment for us

02:40.469 --> 02:43.346
at Gretchen's Bridal Pile &amp;
Beeper Store.

02:43.347 --> 02:45.621
Oh wow, Ma,
you're so good at this.

02:45.622 --> 02:47.308
Maybe I should be marrying you.

02:47.309 --> 02:49.759
I always thought you two
would make a great couple.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
- Oh...
- We'd be a great couple,

02:50.761 --> 02:51.761
- you and I.
- Meant to be.

02:51.762 --> 02:53.429
[both laughing]

02:53.430 --> 02:54.858
I mean, I'm marrying you, but...

02:54.859 --> 02:56.198
- Eh...
- Yeah!

02:56.199 --> 02:58.486
- Goodnight, Ma!
- Goodnight!

02:58.487 --> 02:59.635
That was great.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.670
Hey, your mom is ruining
this wedding for me,

03:01.671 --> 03:03.572
and it's not fair, Danny.
I'm supposed to be the one

03:03.573 --> 03:04.907
that ruins it for
everybody else.

03:04.908 --> 03:06.008
Okay, just relax.

03:06.009 --> 03:08.043
Just be nice and try
on a couple dresses.

03:08.044 --> 03:10.415
If you don't find one you like,
then go get the one you want.

03:10.416 --> 03:11.747
Oh, really Danny?

03:11.748 --> 03:13.543
I can choose my own
dress for my wedding?

03:13.544 --> 03:15.584
That's so nice,
but your mom's gonna come

03:15.585 --> 03:16.786
on the honeymoon with us, right?

03:16.787 --> 03:18.287
So she can tuck you in at night?

03:18.288 --> 03:21.190
I don't know guys,
it doesn't feel very me.

03:21.191 --> 03:23.192
First of all,
I did not know that the Vatican

03:23.193 --> 03:24.493
even made wedding dresses,

03:24.494 --> 03:26.428
you know, and it was always
my dream, growing up,

03:26.429 --> 03:28.097
to wear a beautiful
wedding dress that made

03:28.098 --> 03:29.965
all the groomsmen
tent their pants.

03:29.966 --> 03:31.600
Have you ever
considered that maybe

03:31.601 --> 03:33.803
- the dress is not the problem?
- Huh?

03:33.804 --> 03:36.172
Well, that's the eighth
one you didn't like.

03:36.173 --> 03:39.308
I guess we should go.
I'm sorry, Mindy.

03:39.309 --> 03:43.012
I just really wanted to
help you find a winner.

03:43.013 --> 03:45.247
I mean, it wasn't unhelpful,
Annette,

03:45.248 --> 03:48.551
I definitely know what I don't
want at all in a million years.

03:48.552 --> 03:50.872
It's just that at
Danny's first wedding,

03:50.873 --> 03:53.722
Christina and her
mom boxed me out.

03:53.723 --> 03:57.092
They threw it at
their fancy country club.

03:57.093 --> 03:58.594
I'm sorry, Annette.
That's not cool.

03:58.595 --> 03:59.881
Thank you, Mindy.

03:59.882 --> 04:03.632
So, that dress is definitely...

04:03.633 --> 04:05.467
I don't know,
maybe I was kind of hasty.

04:05.468 --> 04:07.469
I kinda like it. I'll get it.

04:07.470 --> 04:08.987
- Yes!
- Ohh!

04:08.988 --> 04:11.874
Everyone, I present to you,
my wedding dress.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.642
Oh, yeah! [beat boxing sounds]

04:13.643 --> 04:15.711
- Wow.
- Holy God.

04:15.712 --> 04:17.079
- Whoa.
- You know, I get paid

04:17.079 --> 04:19.081
like a thousand dollars
for this in Japan.

04:19.082 --> 04:22.111
Wow, that looks amazing...
on Tamra.

04:22.112 --> 04:24.653
Okay, I'm going to be her weight
and her height by my wedding.

04:24.654 --> 04:26.055
You know, I actually entered

04:26.056 --> 04:27.890
your sexual history into
an online wedding dress finder.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.078
It said you can just
wear a lawn and leaf bag.

04:30.079 --> 04:33.596
Or totally nude with a nun
chanting "Shame, shame."

04:33.597 --> 04:35.497
Pardon the interruption,
Mindy, but would you mind

04:35.498 --> 04:36.665
working for a few minutes?

04:36.666 --> 04:38.868
- Nah, I'll pass.
- Mm-hm. Just a sec.

04:38.869 --> 04:40.309
Hey, no no no wait,
she's not done...

04:41.828 --> 04:44.728
Now, I support your legal
right to marry Danny.

04:44.729 --> 04:46.508
Jody, you know
that I'm a woman, right?

04:46.509 --> 04:48.677
I'm just concerned
that your wedding planning

04:48.678 --> 04:50.512
has begun to encroach
upon our business venture.

04:50.513 --> 04:54.769
What? Jody, I assure you, I am
100% committed to "Later, Baby."

04:54.770 --> 04:58.053
In fact,
I started us a Periscope account.

04:58.054 --> 05:01.123
Then, I forgot about it,
and 100 people saw me shave my ears.

05:01.124 --> 05:02.892
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

05:02.893 --> 05:04.660
Because I've booked us to
speak at my Alma Mater.

05:04.661 --> 05:06.595
What? That's incredible.

05:06.596 --> 05:08.530
Yes. Southern Legacy University.

05:08.531 --> 05:10.766
John Wilkes Booth School
of Political Creationism.

05:10.767 --> 05:13.669
- We leave Friday.
- Wait, Friday?

05:13.670 --> 05:15.804
Oh, Jody, I can't go.

05:15.805 --> 05:18.835
Oh, yes, you can.
It's an integrated campus.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.843
I mean, it will be,
when you're there.

05:20.844 --> 05:23.679
No... although, that's...
alarming.

05:23.680 --> 05:27.716
The truth is, I haven't exactly
told Danny about our business

05:27.717 --> 05:29.852
or that I even want to
go back to work at all.

05:29.853 --> 05:31.987
We've just been going
through this stuff

05:31.988 --> 05:35.557
Oh, some stuff.
Well, isn't that just dandy?

05:35.558 --> 05:37.192
You know, I never would've
gone into business with you

05:37.193 --> 05:40.062
if I had known that you were such
an air-headed flibbity-jibbit.

05:40.063 --> 05:43.966
A fli... how dare you! Okay, we are
not in business together, sir.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.935
"Later, Baby" is my company,
you just made it

05:45.936 --> 05:47.970
a million times better
with your great ideas.

05:47.971 --> 05:50.116
Yeah, keep walking,
Kimble-Kinney.

05:51.675 --> 05:53.142
Yeah, well it ended
up to be okay.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.343
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

05:54.344 --> 05:56.831
Babe, did you get me
these cool new boat shoes?

05:56.832 --> 05:58.916
- No. Oh, my God...
- What?

05:58.917 --> 06:03.087
The only person I know uncool enough
to like those shoes, are you...

06:03.088 --> 06:04.687
all: Surprise!

06:04.688 --> 06:05.721
Oh, my God!

06:05.722 --> 06:07.289
Rishi,
say surprise to your sister.

06:07.290 --> 06:09.058
Yeah, I saw her,
like, yesterday.

06:09.059 --> 06:10.693
- Hi!
- Hello.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.094
What are you guys doing here?

06:12.095 --> 06:13.681
Well, I've come to help
you plan your wedding.

06:13.682 --> 06:15.864
Your prayers have been answered.

06:15.865 --> 06:18.467
And you guys are... you
guys are staying... here?

06:18.468 --> 06:22.190
Oh, if we're in your hair, there
is a hotel at the airport.

06:22.191 --> 06:24.573
Don't worry that we already
brought up our heavy bags.

06:24.574 --> 06:25.902
We can go.

06:25.903 --> 06:28.744
No. Mr. Lahiri,
my home is your home.

06:28.745 --> 06:30.079
No, no, don't do that.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.413
Oh, that's wonderful,
because we took all the clothes

06:31.414 --> 06:33.315
out of your closet and put
them on the fire escape.

06:33.316 --> 06:36.118
I'm gonna chill here too till
my girlfriend's birthday passes,

06:36.119 --> 06:38.020
'cause I'm not trying
to get her a gift.

06:38.021 --> 06:39.989
This is great.
This is like a big sleepover,

06:39.990 --> 06:41.957
all eight of us in
a one-bedroom apartment.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.059
Now, Mindy, while we're in town,
we'd like to

06:44.060 --> 06:45.361
throw a little engagement party

06:45.362 --> 06:46.929
to meet your friends
and Danny's mother.

06:46.930 --> 06:48.430
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's great,

06:48.431 --> 06:51.803
but it's absolutely not possible,
'cause Ma is...

06:51.804 --> 06:55.337
she's not here.
She's in... New Jersey.

06:55.338 --> 06:56.516
Oh, that's not far.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.907
No, yeah, no, I meant New Haven.

06:58.908 --> 07:00.309
That's also not too far.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.310
She's dead.

07:01.311 --> 07:02.689
- [gasps]
- Wh... what?

07:02.690 --> 07:06.615
I'm so sorry, Danny.
When did that happen?

07:06.616 --> 07:09.685
I don't know why I said that.
No, she's alive. She can come.

07:09.686 --> 07:12.187
- What?
- He's just making a joke.

07:12.188 --> 07:13.555
Yeah, it's... it's funny.

07:13.556 --> 07:15.958
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, I know.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.159
Okay, can I talk for a second?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.227
- Sure.
- Gimme one second.

07:18.228 --> 07:19.561
- Okay.
- So, I...

07:19.562 --> 07:21.230
Hey, you're acting really weird.

07:21.231 --> 07:22.898
Trust me,
we don't want Ma to come.

07:22.899 --> 07:25.267
What? You love introducing
your mother to people.

07:25.268 --> 07:27.836
I mean,
except me and my parents.

07:27.837 --> 07:29.238
Oh, my God.

07:29.239 --> 07:31.407
Does your mother have
a problem with beautiful people?

07:31.408 --> 07:33.842
No, it's just,
you've been doing such a good job

07:33.843 --> 07:36.478
involving her with the wedding,
but now that your parents are here,

07:36.479 --> 07:38.047
she's gonna feel
threatened, okay?

07:38.048 --> 07:41.884
They went to college, they're
worldly, they flaunt their wealth.

07:41.885 --> 07:43.085
Wealth? What wealth?

07:43.086 --> 07:45.120
My weekly allowance
is still crap.

07:45.121 --> 07:48.109
Look, Ma only likes people
who are exactly the same as her

07:48.110 --> 07:49.992
culturally,
but slightly worse off,

07:49.993 --> 07:51.927
so she can feel comfortable,
but superior.

07:51.928 --> 07:55.616
- Okay. We'll keep them apart.
- Great.

07:56.699 --> 07:59.435
Oh, wow! Sorry, sir.

07:59.436 --> 08:00.969
[sighs] We need to find a hotel

08:00.970 --> 08:02.504
for your parents.
It's too crowded.

08:02.505 --> 08:04.540
I've seen your father's
penis five times already.

Okay, you know what,
I am basically your mother's

08:06.843 --> 08:09.011

24/7 gynecologist.

were gonna do it.

Danny, Mindy,
there are robbers in your house.

08:24.794 --> 08:25.961
- Ma!
- Stop, stop, stop.

08:25.962 --> 08:27.362
What are you doing?
Put down the knife.

08:27.363 --> 08:30.132
It's just Mindy's parents,
they're not robbers.

08:30.133 --> 08:33.635
Oh, my... Mindy's parents!

08:33.635 --> 08:34.655
Ma, no, oh...

08:34.655 --> 08:38.807
- Oh, how nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.576
Nobody told me you were here,

08:40.577 --> 08:43.245
despite numerous
opportunities to do so.

08:43.246 --> 08:46.000
Well, the good news is
that the introduction was made.

08:46.001 --> 08:47.716
- Yes.

08:47.717 --> 08:49.785

Let's go to T.J.

come to the engagement party?

08:56.297 --> 08:57.553
Engagement party?

08:57.554 --> 09:00.195
What engagement party? Danny?

09:00.196 --> 09:02.331
No. There is no
engagement party...

09:02.332 --> 09:05.934

guys to go meet the Shulman gang

get diarrhea." - [gasps] No!

Excuse me, what is that saying?

09:13.576 --> 09:15.711
Oh, it... it's nothing.
It's absolutely nothing.

know you that well. Whatever.

Oh, Dr. C, Can I bring Neil?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.281
- Neil the dog?
- I'll put a sweater on him.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.479
No, only humans.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.351
What's the dress code?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.686
Nothing you have will work.
You'll have to buy something.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.655
Okay, you can borrow
one of my blazers.

Oh, sorry, you guys are

you wanted to tell Ma?

11:10.437 --> 11:13.939
Yes. About my wound,
which is healed.

But the rash around
it is worse than ever.

Hey, man. No. Jody, I can't go.

and I spent the money

Taiwan that made me barf.

she wants you to come listen.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.127
What...
why are your clothes out?

12:08.695 --> 12:12.131
Well, the name of the play
is already "Sheer Madness".

12:12.132 --> 12:14.100
So you can only imagine
the level of madness

12:14.101 --> 12:16.135

went off in the theater.

their phones on us so we could

to a standing ovation.

we went to SeaWorld in the summer.

12:35.558 --> 12:41.127
So, we're thinking, school's out,
everybody's gonna be there,

12:41.128 --> 12:44.655

In and out in three hours!

performance for the party.

a dress to do it.

Jody and I were gonna
go on a business trip.

You guys are in
business together?

13:44.382 --> 13:46.892
Yeah. We've been
traveling to colleges,

to freeze their eggs.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.097
So, in addition to
your regular practice

13:52.098 --> 13:54.767
and your fertility practice,
you have a third job?

13:54.768 --> 13:57.069
What about our family?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.071
Well, it's great for our family.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.398

14:01.399 --> 14:03.842

are really responding.

like I'm a role model.

supposed to be working.

talk to you about that.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.111
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.112
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

you wanna keep doing it.

I realized something too

15:11.811 --> 15:14.213
when I was taking care of my dad.
I thought...

[sighs] My childhood
was terrible

and Richie and I basically,

that for our son.

here for two days, and you've

out of the window 14 times.

some getting used to,

You know what, I do. I love
seeing every wrinkly inch of it,

because that's life,
that's what family is.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.074
I didn't have that growing up,
and I'd like Leo to have it,

There's nothing better.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.544

He is loved.

if that is not enough for you, then,

up your career and stay at home?

Yeah, that's what my mom wants.

16:50.832 --> 16:52.878
Well, maybe somebody
could've told me that

16:52.879 --> 16:54.380
before I ruined your party.

16:54.381 --> 16:58.050
Please. Two screaming mother-in-laws
does not ruin a party.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.718
In India,
it's rude if you don't fight.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.153
[laughs] Yeah.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.055
You know, Mindy,
I guess it's just that

17:03.056 --> 17:06.657
I've come to think of you
as a daughter, of sorts.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.837
And then when Sonar flits into
town all glamorous and rich,

17:09.838 --> 17:13.898
I wonder how I fit into the picture,
and I go a little crazy.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.800
That's actually kind of
hard for me to understand

17:15.801 --> 17:18.103
because Danny and I are, like,
so reasonable and cool-headed.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.972
Sorry. [Annette laughs]

17:19.973 --> 17:22.608
Hey, wait a minute,
shouldn't you be on a plane?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.742
Wait, you think I should
go on my business trip?

17:24.743 --> 17:26.310
I thought you weren't
voting for Hilary Clinton

17:26.311 --> 17:28.981
because you thought she should
spend more time being a grandma.

17:28.982 --> 17:31.583
Oh, I just say that stuff
because I'm jealous.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.886
You and Hilary are living
the life I never got.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.756
I had to work crappy jobs
to support my family,

17:37.757 --> 17:40.726
but you are working to
make your dreams come true.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.246
And it sucks... for me.

17:44.247 --> 17:46.999
For you, I couldn't be happier.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.636
You know, Annette,
Sonu might be my mom,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.505
but you... you're my Ma.

17:53.506 --> 17:57.343
Really? Wow.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.428
I can't wait to rub
that in her face.

17:59.429 --> 18:00.846
Mm-kay.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.216
Guess what, Princess Jasmine?
Your daughter just called me Ma.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.151
Okay, well,
please don't do that.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.187
That would really get
me in a lot of trouble.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.056
- Morning, Tarun.
- Good morning, Danny.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.192
Hey, did Mindy sleep
out here last night?

18:13.193 --> 18:17.296
No, it appears she went on
her business trip to Georgia.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.497
[sighs] Well, that's great.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.699
That's really
considerate of her.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.000
- Danny?
- Yeah?

18:22.001 --> 18:24.411
Did I ever tell you
that Sonu put her acting career

18:24.412 --> 18:26.505
on hold to raise our family?

18:26.506 --> 18:27.873
And it was the right choice,
right?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.508
I mean,
that's what I keep telling Mindy.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.711
Nope. She's resented
me for 30 years.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.671
Well, she always seems so happy.

18:34.672 --> 18:36.682
Most of the time, yes,

18:36.683 --> 18:40.319
but then, once a week, she screams,
"You ruined my dreams!"

18:40.320 --> 18:42.971
and throws a scalding
teabag at my face.

18:42.972 --> 18:46.124
Danny, giving up
your passions is very hard,

18:46.125 --> 18:47.793
no matter what you
give it up for.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.830
And Mindy is a much better
doctor than Sonu was an actress.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.800
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.903
- What did you say?
- Oh, shoot.

18:59.101 --> 19:00.506
[crowd laughing]

19:00.507 --> 19:02.590
So we're suggesting
that this year,

19:02.591 --> 19:04.725
you don't spend spring
break in Myrtle Beach

19:04.726 --> 19:06.460
bringing shame on your families.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.429
Guys, spring break is a joke.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.698
The drinks are crazy expensive,
you make out with a girl

19:10.699 --> 19:12.366
to get into a video,
and then they edit you out.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.035
[laughter]

19:14.036 --> 19:15.536
So, we'd like to propose instead

19:15.537 --> 19:17.972
that you come to New York
and freeze your eggs.

19:17.973 --> 19:19.673
And if you still wanna
bring shame to your family,

19:19.674 --> 19:22.143
you can stay in New York
and take improv classes.

19:22.144 --> 19:23.477
Thanks so much for
coming out, guys.

19:23.478 --> 19:24.478
Thank you.

19:24.479 --> 19:25.980
[applause]

19:25.981 --> 19:29.351
Does anyone have any
questions about this process?

19:29.352 --> 19:31.485
Yeah, we'll start in the back,
there.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.754
Uh... I have a question.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.289
Oh, sorry.

19:35.290 --> 19:37.324
The only male in the room,
clearly a pervert.

19:37.325 --> 19:39.293
Security, please escort
this man from the room.

19:39.294 --> 19:41.128
No no no no, I'm...
I'm not a pervert.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.463
I... I just want to say that

19:42.464 --> 19:43.864
I think you're both
doing a great job.

19:43.865 --> 19:45.466
I don't have ovaries,
but this is...

19:45.467 --> 19:47.068
wouldn't you say,
this is a very...

19:47.069 --> 19:48.769
it's a very compelling
presentation.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.138
I have a question
for Dr. Lahiri.

19:51.139 --> 19:54.842
Just wondering if you
had dinner plans tonight.

19:54.843 --> 19:56.544
No, I would love to
have dinner with you.

19:56.545 --> 19:59.313
[applause]

19:59.314 --> 20:00.581
It's Danny, we work with him.

20:00.582 --> 20:03.135
Ah, well, hello, Danny.

20:04.256 --> 20:07.222
Wow. Min, that was incredible.

20:07.223 --> 20:09.790
Thank you.
I can't believe you came down here.

20:09.791 --> 20:10.925
You're so great at this.

20:10.926 --> 20:14.962
I can see now
that you can do both.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.730
I'm so happy to hear that.

20:16.731 --> 20:18.199
Yeah, you can stay
home with Leo,

20:18.200 --> 20:21.035
and do this on the weekend,
like a hobby.

20:21.036 --> 20:22.069
Hobby?

20:22.070 --> 20:23.504
Yeah, it's perfect
for being a mom,

20:23.505 --> 20:24.905
'cause we're gonna
have another kid soon,

20:24.906 --> 20:27.308
and then, you know,
this will get you out of the house.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.843
We're having another kid?

20:28.844 --> 20:31.045
Yeah, that's why
I pushed up the wedding...

20:31.046 --> 20:34.782
'cause you wanna have
more kids. Right?

20:34.783 --> 20:37.952
I haven't thought about it
in a while, but... yeah.

20:37.953 --> 20:38.962
Yes. Yeah.

20:38.963 --> 20:43.023
Good. Ah, I love you.
I'm proud of you.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.625
- Thanks.
- Hey, let's go home.

20:44.626 --> 20:46.637
Okay.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.434
Well, whatever you did to Danny
under that airline blanket

20:53.435 --> 20:54.802
seems to have paid off.

20:54.803 --> 20:56.904
- He's tuckered out.
- Hm.

20:56.905 --> 21:01.175
So, am I to assume that you
two have everything sorted?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.776
Yeah...

21:02.777 --> 21:05.012
I've found that the longer
a "yeah" stretches out,

21:05.013 --> 21:07.081
the more it might
mean something else.

21:07.082 --> 21:09.316
- No.
- Oh, dear.

21:09.317 --> 21:10.851
It's fine. We're good. We spoke,

21:10.852 --> 21:14.155
and I'm going to continue to
do "Later, Baby" as a hobby.

21:14.156 --> 21:16.090
A hobby? Our business?

21:16.091 --> 21:18.559
Yeah, you know,
it's just something that I can do

21:18.560 --> 21:20.861
in between having kids.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.230
I mean, is that what you want?

21:23.231 --> 21:26.260
I don't know.
I mean, I'll figure it out.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.437
Hm.

21:30.438 --> 21:31.872
What does "hm" mean?

21:31.873 --> 21:34.408
Oh, it's nothing,
I was just thinking about last time

21:34.409 --> 21:36.644
I said, "We'll figure it out."

21:36.645 --> 21:38.078
What happened?

21:38.079 --> 21:41.849
We didn't. I had to leave
my home and the love of my life

21:41.850 --> 21:46.153
for that godforsaken
cesspool where I met you.

21:46.154 --> 21:48.657
Oh, but that's a completely
different situation

21:48.658 --> 21:51.325
than you're in,
I wouldn't worry about it.

21:51.326 --> 21:53.160
Just make sure
that when you do figure out

21:53.161 --> 21:57.161
exactly what you want,
you don't lose sight of it, okay?

22:03.705 --> 22:07.541
Meanwhile, I have figured
out exactly what I want.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.511
The stewardess is giving me a signal
to meet her in the lavatory.

22:10.512 --> 22:13.347
Oh, God. You are a sex criminal.

22:13.348 --> 22:15.892
Get out of here. Ugh.
