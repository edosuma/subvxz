ART TEACHER: Let's paint a picture

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
of someone you love.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Maybe someone who's not with us anymore.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Thanks, man.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Thank you, Riley.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I had a great time
painting with you.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Now, you keep on painting,
and God bless.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It's so beautiful.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Thank you, boy.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, that's it.
Out of memory.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
You can start
cleaning it off now.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
What? But--
But what--?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
No buts. Start drawing on paper,
and this wouldn't happen.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Nobody told you
to paint all over my house

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
'cause you want
to make a point.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
This ain't  Beat Street.
