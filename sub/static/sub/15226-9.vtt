01:24.417 --> 01:26.418
Hey, Alex, can I talk to ya
         for a second?

01:26.485 --> 01:27.452
I got a problem.

01:27.519 --> 01:29.253
You got a problem?
Sure, Tony, what is it?

01:29.321 --> 01:31.756
Well, I'm at the crossroads
              of my life and I'm
                a little scared.

01:31.824 --> 01:33.591
Yeah?
             I mean, it's really
                   eatin' at me,

01:33.659 --> 01:35.860
and you're standin' here
            with this goofy grin
                   on your face.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.062
I'm grinning?

01:37.129 --> 01:38.930
Yeah, you have been ever
           since I came in here.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.165
Oh, I'm sorry,
I wasn't aware of it.

01:40.232 --> 01:42.167
I'll stop.

01:42.234 --> 01:43.801
Did I stop yet?

01:43.869 --> 01:45.703
What'd you have, a great date
      last night, Alex, or what?

01:45.771 --> 01:47.105
No, no, no,
better than that.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.908
I won 1,300 bucks
on yesterday's football game.

01:49.975 --> 01:51.376
Are you kiddin'?
(laughing):
No.

01:51.477 --> 01:53.477
Oh, you guys and that
        gambling thing.

01:53.545 --> 01:54.612
It's disgusting.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.847
But I won it all from Louie.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.716
Ooh. Mwah!

01:57.783 --> 01:59.717
How-How many games
                    did you win?

01:59.785 --> 02:01.186
All of them.
                (Elaine screams)

02:01.253 --> 02:02.453
Louie lost every game?

02:02.521 --> 02:04.622
Every single one.
              Man.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.725
You know, losin' every game
    is a new garage record.

02:06.826 --> 02:07.959
ELAINE:
                           Yeah.
        Yeah, you know,

02:08.026 --> 02:10.562
I never thought anything would
make me feel sorry for Louie...

02:10.628 --> 02:12.797
and I was right.

02:12.864 --> 02:15.433
Well, why did you make
        such a big bet?

02:15.501 --> 02:16.601
Oh, it wasn't me. He insisted.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.302
He'd been losing
      a lot to me lately,

02:18.371 --> 02:19.671
so he wanted to catch up.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.374
(clattering)

02:38.624 --> 02:40.758
Uh, can I have your attention?

02:40.826 --> 02:43.595
Louie says that
     if anybody laughs at,

02:43.663 --> 02:46.598
or ridicules him when
  he comes in, they're fired.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.266
Is that understood?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.268
(other muttering agreement)
Yeah, all right,
that sounds good.

03:02.381 --> 03:04.482
Are you sure you understand?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.350
(all muttering agreement)
                  We understand!

03:06.452 --> 03:09.387
JEFF:
    They understand, Louie.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.356
(all jeering and laughing)

03:20.532 --> 03:22.500
You all like
                     Ignatowski?

03:24.070 --> 03:26.004
Shut up or he's a
                 cocker spaniel.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.141
(grunts)

03:32.177 --> 03:34.345
No brains, no pain.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.914
Hey, Louie, come on,
        come on, pay up.

03:36.982 --> 03:38.516
Oh, I got a better idea,
            Reiger.

03:38.584 --> 03:41.085
Let's go double or nothin'
on tonight's game.

03:41.153 --> 03:43.154
You win, I owe you $2,600.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.421
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

03:44.489 --> 03:46.224
Come on, you gotta.
                   What I gotta?

03:46.291 --> 03:47.492
Because it's the code.

03:47.559 --> 03:48.660
What code?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.861
Guys.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.061
It's a guys' code.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.397
I mean, it's what guys do.

03:52.464 --> 03:53.564
Ah...
I mean, it's--
come on, Reiger,

03:53.632 --> 03:54.965
let's be guys.
I mean, come on.

03:55.033 --> 03:56.167
What are we, animals
or something?

03:56.234 --> 03:57.702
Let's be guys.
I want to be guys.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.270
Don't you want
to be guys?

03:59.371 --> 04:01.205
It's a guys' code!
           All right, all right,
                      all right.

04:01.273 --> 04:03.207
Okay.

04:03.275 --> 04:05.209
If it means that
                    much to you,

04:05.277 --> 04:07.978
I'll go double or nothing with
          you on tonight's game.

04:08.046 --> 04:09.113
ELAINE:
No, Alex!

04:09.181 --> 04:10.915
Don't do this.
Get your money now!

04:10.983 --> 04:11.816
Don't listen to her.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.884
She's not guys.

04:13.953 --> 04:15.420
All right.

04:15.487 --> 04:16.587
Okay, thanks.

04:16.654 --> 04:18.356
All right.
All right,
who do you want?

04:18.423 --> 04:19.957
Well, the way you've
       been going lately,

04:20.024 --> 04:21.759
I'd be crazy not
        to let you pick.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.127
Me?
                            Mmm.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.129
Okay.

04:24.196 --> 04:25.697
All right, fine, I'll pick.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.032
I'll take Oakland.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.067
Fine.

04:29.135 --> 04:32.070
What do you mean, fine?

04:32.138 --> 04:33.404
Forget it, Reiger.

04:33.472 --> 04:34.973
You got Oakland,
      I'm taking Houston.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.173
Okay, you got Houston.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.110
Oh, you'd love me
        to take Houston.

04:39.178 --> 04:42.113
Well, think again.

04:42.181 --> 04:43.581
I got Oakland.

04:43.649 --> 04:45.917
Okay, you got Oakland.

04:45.951 --> 04:48.152
Do I look like that
       big a sap to you?

04:48.187 --> 04:49.688
I want Houston and Oakland.

04:49.755 --> 04:51.589
I can't do that. No. What?
Louie!

04:51.657 --> 04:52.690
Pick.
                        Houston.

04:52.758 --> 04:53.724
Cage.
                       Cage.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.693
Hut, hut,
hut, hut.
                     Hut.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.397
Hey, Alex,
can we talk now?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.465
Oh, yeah, Tony,
                      I'm sorry.

05:00.532 --> 05:02.133
Come on.
                  Uh, what's up?

05:02.201 --> 05:04.469
Alex, I think I finally found
something in my life

05:04.536 --> 05:05.703
to take the place
of boxing.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.005
Oh, that's great, Tony.
                     What is it?

05:07.072 --> 05:08.206
Managing.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.308
See, I found this great
heavyweight down at my gym.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.577
You think this guy's
               really good, huh?
Alex,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.178
I think this guy
could go all the way.

05:14.246 --> 05:16.347
I mean, he won a bronze
medal at the Olympics.

05:16.448 --> 05:17.682
He would have won a gold,

05:17.750 --> 05:19.918
except he lost a split
decision to some Cuban.

05:19.985 --> 05:21.920
Commie judges.
                           Yeah.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.923
Anyway, uh, I think if I could
talk this guy into going pro,

05:24.990 --> 05:27.191
and if I could talk him
into lettin' me manage him,

05:27.259 --> 05:29.226
well, I think this guy
just needs the right guy

05:29.294 --> 05:30.495
to bring him along.
             Hey, wait a minute.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.896
Now you're gettin' me excited,
              but wait a minute,

05:31.963 --> 05:33.597
you said there was a problem.
        Now what's that problem?

05:33.665 --> 05:34.799
I'm havin' lunch with him
     today at Mario's, see?

05:34.867 --> 05:37.635
And I'm kinda scared
   because I'd feel real bad

05:37.703 --> 05:39.303
if-if he didn't respect me
       enough to say yes.

05:39.371 --> 05:40.705
I mean, maybe I ain't got
         what it takes.

05:40.773 --> 05:41.973
Maybe I ain't good enough.

05:42.007 --> 05:43.908
Ah, now, Tony,
                   listen to me.

05:43.975 --> 05:45.910
What, Alex?
                   That's silly.

05:45.977 --> 05:47.578
Silly?

05:47.646 --> 05:49.079
Okay.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.514
Thanks a lot, Alex.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.351
You bet.

05:53.418 --> 05:55.286
Ow!

06:11.236 --> 06:14.338
Hey, Tommy, this is a real
important luncheon, see?

06:14.406 --> 06:15.806
I'm tryin' to impress
somebody.

06:15.874 --> 06:18.576
So, uh, would you try
and treat me like a big shot?

06:18.644 --> 06:19.843
Sure.
      Okay.

06:19.911 --> 06:22.446
Okay, a-and make the place look
a little classy, will ya?

06:22.514 --> 06:24.682
Would you like me to go home
       and wash my hair?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.484
I don't think there's time
         for that, Tom.

06:29.355 --> 06:30.955
Hey, Terry,
over here.
                    Hey, man.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.289
Hey, how are ya?
                All right.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.291
Nice to see ya.
Sit down, sit down.
                    Hey, thanks.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.260
There you go.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.295
A little closer?
      Yeah...

06:40.766 --> 06:42.132
Hey, uh, hey, Tommy,

06:42.200 --> 06:43.234
we're ready
to start eatin'.

06:43.301 --> 06:44.969
Right away, Mr. Banta.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.842
Uh, hey, I hope you don't mind
I ordered for us.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.510
Uh, meatball sandwiches
all right with you?

06:52.578 --> 06:55.346
Hey, yeah, I like
            meatball sandwiches.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.249
I knew it.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.117
Thanks
for the "Mr. Banta."

07:01.754 --> 07:03.087
And, uh, here's the phone

07:03.155 --> 07:05.389
you always have on your table
       when you eat here.

07:05.457 --> 07:07.959
Nice... Nice touch.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.028
Wow, all right!

07:10.095 --> 07:11.862
Yeah. Did you hear
that joke

07:11.930 --> 07:13.364
they were tellin' at the gym
the other day?
                             No.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.366
The one about the, uh,
sailor and the parrot?
                             No.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.435
Well, there's this sailor
who's got this parrot...

07:17.503 --> 07:19.503
Oh, that one!

07:19.571 --> 07:21.638
I heard it.
                           Yeah.
Yeah, it's good,
huh?

07:21.706 --> 07:23.541
(phone ringing)

07:32.817 --> 07:34.552
Excuse me a minute.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.886
Sure thing.

07:35.954 --> 07:37.988
Banta Management.

07:38.056 --> 07:39.924
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.926
Oh, right.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.427
Yeah, mm-hmm.

07:43.495 --> 07:44.461
Oh, I got it.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.796
Yeah, okay.

07:45.864 --> 07:47.798
Bye-bye.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.133
Well, who was it?

07:49.200 --> 07:50.367
Hey, it was personal.

07:51.403 --> 07:54.405
But, uh, hey, Tommy, uh,
        do me a favor--

07:54.473 --> 07:57.775
send a giant mushroom pizza over
  to my friend Pantuso, on me.

08:03.682 --> 08:07.085
Hey, hey, man, you're good
         on the phone.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.252
Yeah, huh.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.720
Hey, uh, hey, this is fun,
           you know?

08:09.788 --> 08:11.155
It's good to get out
         with a friend.

08:11.223 --> 08:12.590
I mean, somebody you like
          and respect.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.091
Yeah.
      Wouldn't mind going
      into business with.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.860
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.795
Yeah.

08:19.564 --> 08:21.499
(muffled):
Hey, Terry...

08:23.568 --> 08:25.669
...the reason I asked you
today is...

08:25.737 --> 08:27.772
you ever thought
about going pro?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.341
(muffled):
   Yeah, I thought about it.

08:30.408 --> 08:32.376
I mean...

08:32.443 --> 08:33.811
it's every fighter's dream,
           you know?

08:33.879 --> 08:35.145
You really think
        I'm good enough?

08:35.214 --> 08:37.014
Oh...

08:37.149 --> 08:39.015
I got a lot...

08:39.150 --> 08:41.452
I got a lot of faith
in you, Terry.

08:41.519 --> 08:43.054
All you need is a little work.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.054
Don't you worry,

08:44.121 --> 08:45.556
I'll be right there
to help you.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.391
(mumbling)

08:47.459 --> 08:49.327
What are you talking about?

08:49.395 --> 08:51.329
Oh...

08:51.397 --> 08:53.331
Don't feel bad
about saying no,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.299
but...

08:55.367 --> 08:57.835
I would like to manage you.

08:57.903 --> 08:59.837
(both mumbling)

09:01.307 --> 09:03.007
...just you and
                        me, huh?

09:03.075 --> 09:04.408
All the way, baby.
                       Look, uh,

09:04.476 --> 09:06.077
I gotta go.
Oh, all right.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.980
(mumbling)
                         Okay.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.614
Oh... uh...

09:10.682 --> 09:12.616
(mumbling)
   Oh, yeah.

09:14.119 --> 09:14.885
You're gonna manage him, huh?

09:14.987 --> 09:16.154
Oh yeah, Tommy.

09:16.221 --> 09:18.422
I just hope he can fight better
         than he talks.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.598
(crowd cheering on TV)

09:27.666 --> 09:29.566
They scored! They scored!

09:29.668 --> 09:31.035
Did you see that, Reiger?

09:31.102 --> 09:32.336
They scored!

09:32.404 --> 09:34.338
(hums happily)

09:35.708 --> 09:37.642
Houston's comin'
                  back, you sap!

09:37.710 --> 09:39.143
(laughs)

09:39.211 --> 09:40.979
Three more points
           and I win, Reiger!

09:41.046 --> 09:41.979
Three more points.

09:42.047 --> 09:43.081
Ya hear that, Elaine?

09:43.148 --> 09:44.315
Three more points.

09:44.416 --> 09:45.783
Go, Houston, Iggy!

09:45.851 --> 09:49.020
I'll go.
                     No, no, no,
            don't go to Houston.

09:49.087 --> 09:50.521
Go, Houston.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.456
All right...

09:52.524 --> 09:54.058
it's an onside kick.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.326
They recover.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.161
Houston's ball
     in Oakland territory!

09:57.229 --> 09:59.030
The dream is ours!

09:59.097 --> 10:01.165
(blowing raspberry)

10:01.233 --> 10:04.035
I told you not
to let him off the hook.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.603
Don't worry, Elaine.

10:05.670 --> 10:07.638
There's less than a minute
             to go.

10:07.705 --> 10:09.407
Want another beer, Jim?

10:09.441 --> 10:10.574
Uh, no, no, no, Alex.

10:10.642 --> 10:12.276
I don't think he should
         have any more.

10:12.344 --> 10:13.911
Oh, Elaine...

10:13.979 --> 10:15.913
I know exactly
                   when to stop.

10:15.981 --> 10:17.414
(chuckles)

10:17.482 --> 10:18.916
When?

10:18.984 --> 10:20.918
When the pretzels
                  start dancin'.

10:29.427 --> 10:32.363
When they all start
                      dancing...

10:32.430 --> 10:34.365
the fox-trot.

10:36.301 --> 10:38.236
I'm through.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.880
(with British accent):
Hello. What's this?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.515
Oh, hiya, Latka.

10:50.582 --> 10:52.083
Sorry, Sir Geoffrey.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.250
Oh, quite all right, Tommy.

10:53.318 --> 10:55.252
Set me up with a pint,
           would you?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.921
Oh, that's a good fellow.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.724
Could we change the station
on the telly, please?

10:59.791 --> 11:01.258
Uh, <i>Masterpiece Theater</i>

11:01.326 --> 11:04.095
is beginning an adaptation
   of <i>The Moon and Sixpence.</i>

11:04.163 --> 11:06.597
Need I say more?

11:06.665 --> 11:08.933
Louie's watching the
                  football game.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.601
Oh, I'm sure
he won't object

11:10.669 --> 11:13.104
once he's under the spell
of Mr. Maugham.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.106
(clears throat)

11:17.743 --> 11:19.510
Oh, Alistair,

11:19.578 --> 11:22.180
I'm mad for your tailor.

11:22.247 --> 11:25.183
Uh, how about this,
                       Alistair?

11:43.301 --> 11:46.303
I consider this a breach
of good taste.

11:48.340 --> 11:52.210
Go back to merry
                    old nutland.

11:52.277 --> 11:54.611
I pity you.

11:57.649 --> 11:59.750
There's still such a thing
as a strong letter

11:59.817 --> 12:01.752
to the <i>Times,</i> you know.

12:01.819 --> 12:03.754
Get outta here.

12:03.821 --> 12:05.756
Get out of here.

12:13.498 --> 12:15.332
Hey, guys.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.335
Elaine, Elaine, Alex and Jim,

12:18.403 --> 12:19.670
this is my fighter,
         Terry Carver.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.572
Oh, hi.
 The next heavyweight champion
         of the world!

12:21.640 --> 12:22.907
And I'm his new manager.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.508
Well, hi, Terry.

12:24.576 --> 12:26.010
You got a great
                  manager there.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.511
Yeah, well, Terry's
one hell of a fighter.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.380
I'm just glad I could
get him to turn pro.

12:29.481 --> 12:31.081
Yeah, you know, my folks
              didn't want me to.

12:31.149 --> 12:32.850
I mean, they was afraid
           I might hurt my hands

12:32.918 --> 12:34.618
and wouldn't be able
             to do my other job.

12:34.686 --> 12:35.819
Oh... what's that?

12:35.887 --> 12:38.522
Construction.

12:40.459 --> 12:43.194
Well, it's, uh, something
        to think about.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.629
Hey, look, I-I
                   gotta go, uh,

12:44.696 --> 12:46.263
it was nice meeting all
                your pals, Tony.
  Okay.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.165
I'll see you out.
                    Nice to meet
                       you, Ter.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.466
Hey, uh, Tony, can I, uh,

12:49.568 --> 12:51.735
can I talk to you about
    something for a second?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.271
Oh, sure, uh, excuse me, uh,

12:53.338 --> 12:56.274
I gotta talk to my kid.

12:56.341 --> 12:59.043
Look, uh, I got
                    a call today

12:59.110 --> 13:00.578
from this guy from
                 some kind of...

13:00.646 --> 13:03.513
syndicate and he wants
                  to talk to me.

13:03.582 --> 13:04.915
Something about buying me.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.450
A syndicate?

13:06.517 --> 13:08.452
Hey, you better stay away
from guys like that.

13:08.519 --> 13:10.554
They're bad for boxing
and they're bad for you.

13:10.621 --> 13:12.389
I told him I already
                  got a manager.

13:12.457 --> 13:13.423
All right, Terry,
that's the way.

13:13.492 --> 13:14.892
But he wants to talk
                   to me anyway.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.827
I-I mean, just talk to me.

13:16.895 --> 13:18.462
Hey, I swear, Tony,
                  you're my man.

13:18.530 --> 13:22.266
In fact, if you don't
              want me to talk to
                   him, I won't.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.601
I don't want you
to talk to him.

13:23.669 --> 13:24.968
Already said I would.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.073
Oh.

13:29.174 --> 13:31.875
Hey, let me just talk
             to him, okay, Tony?

13:31.944 --> 13:34.178
Uh, yeah, I guess.

13:34.279 --> 13:35.913
Hey, thanks, Tony.

13:35.980 --> 13:36.847
All right.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.916
See ya later.
                    Okay.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.217
TONY:
Good kid, huh?

13:40.284 --> 13:42.586
ALEX:
Yeah. Good guy.

13:42.654 --> 13:44.388
All right, all right,
       shut up everybody!

13:44.455 --> 13:45.756
They're gonna kick.

13:45.758 --> 13:49.026
If they make this little
      18-yard field goal,

13:49.094 --> 13:50.828
I win, Reiger!

13:50.896 --> 13:52.029
I win!

13:52.096 --> 13:52.930
ANNOUNCER:
     The ball's snapped...

13:52.997 --> 13:54.899
The ball is snapped,

13:54.966 --> 13:57.367
it's kicked, it's up in the air

13:57.436 --> 13:59.369
and... it's no good!

13:59.438 --> 14:01.171
It's no good.

14:01.239 --> 14:02.206
He missed it!

14:02.274 --> 14:03.574
It's wide left.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.242
My grandmother could've
        kicked it better

14:05.310 --> 14:07.211
than that dumb Rumanian!

14:07.279 --> 14:08.913
He missed it, Reiger!

14:08.980 --> 14:11.749
I just lost $2,600!

14:11.817 --> 14:13.751
My life is manure!

14:19.024 --> 14:22.359
You feel terrible,
don't you, boss?

14:22.427 --> 14:25.329
Iggy, I never felt
               worse in my life.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.331
Would you feel better

14:27.399 --> 14:30.834
if I gave you the money
you just lost?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.873
Of course I would.

14:36.909 --> 14:37.908
Well, too bad.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.910
I don't have it.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.550
You pulled my ear.

14:46.618 --> 14:47.951
I pulled your leg.

15:04.736 --> 15:07.404
Hey, by the way, uh,
          just out of curiosity,

15:07.472 --> 15:09.406
you ever talk to them guys
             from the syndicate?

15:09.474 --> 15:11.908
Oh, yeah,
they took me to lunch.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.410
Took you to
                     lunch, huh?

15:13.478 --> 15:15.212
Where?
Oh, some crummy place,

15:15.280 --> 15:16.547
couldn't even
afford menus.

15:16.615 --> 15:17.781
I mean,
the guy came around

15:17.849 --> 15:19.783
and told you
what you got to eat.

15:21.853 --> 15:24.655
You're... You're
                     kidding me.

15:24.722 --> 15:26.890
So what'd you
                       tell 'em?

15:26.925 --> 15:28.692
I went for the veal.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.229
No, no, no, I mean about
           signing up with them.

15:32.297 --> 15:34.164
Spread.
I told 'em the same thing
I told you,

15:34.232 --> 15:36.667
I already got a manager
and I'm not interested.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.336
Hey, thanks, Terry.

15:39.437 --> 15:40.937
Anyway, they wanted to know
if it's all right

15:41.005 --> 15:42.306
if they came to
the fight tonight.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.074
I told 'em it's all right,

15:44.209 --> 15:48.045
only if my manager say
it's all right.

15:48.146 --> 15:49.446
Well, I don't want
                       'em here.

15:49.514 --> 15:50.781
I already got 'em tickets.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.552
Well, that's
                      okay, man,

15:54.619 --> 15:56.186
let 'em see what they're
                 missing out on.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.188
Ten minutes, guys.
         Oh, hey, okay.

15:58.256 --> 15:59.689
Hey, Terry,
     did you call your mom?

15:59.758 --> 16:01.625
Oh, not yet.
                  Let me just...
                      this hand.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.460
All right, go ahead,
                    go call her.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.062
Hey, Alex.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.396
Thanks for being
Terry's second tonight.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.265
I appreciate it.
                  Oh, that's all
                    right, Tony.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.366
It's like, uh,
                      old times,

16:09.434 --> 16:11.001
like when I used to
                 second for you.

16:11.069 --> 16:12.069
There's only
one difference.

16:12.136 --> 16:13.270
Terry's probably
gonna win.

16:13.371 --> 16:15.139
Oh.

16:15.206 --> 16:17.107
Just when I was gettin'
        used to saying,

16:17.175 --> 16:20.544
"Give him air, give him air."

16:20.611 --> 16:22.579
Hey, Louie, you're not supposed
          to be here.

16:22.647 --> 16:23.914
Yeah, Louie, get outta here.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.582
I don't want nobody
       screwing this up.
                        Come on.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.683
What, what, what, what?

16:26.751 --> 16:29.486
Go easy here, go easy.

16:29.521 --> 16:32.289
I'm not gonna screw
                    anything up.

16:32.390 --> 16:34.158
I just came here
       to wish you luck.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.759
Yeah, sure.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.494
Honest.

16:37.595 --> 16:39.563
Thanks, Lou.

16:39.664 --> 16:41.065
Well, how's it feel, Tone?

16:41.132 --> 16:43.133
Well, I mean, don't put me
down for this, Louie,

16:43.201 --> 16:44.401
but, uh...

16:44.469 --> 16:45.602
I don't know, all my life

16:45.670 --> 16:47.471
I had this feelin'
     in the back of my mind

16:47.538 --> 16:48.973
that it wasn't supposed
       to happen for me.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.474
You know, like I was jinxed;

16:50.541 --> 16:53.877
like I had a albacore hangin'
        around my neck.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.752
But ever since Terry
       signed up with me,

17:01.819 --> 17:03.420
that feelin's been gone.

17:03.488 --> 17:05.589
All of a sudden, I feel like
      everything's right.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.089
That's good enough for me.

17:07.157 --> 17:08.224
Double or nothin',

17:08.292 --> 17:10.894
Banta's kid goes down
         for the count.

17:10.996 --> 17:14.130
Oh, so that's what this is
        all about, huh?

17:14.198 --> 17:16.132
I'm not gonna bet you
         on this fight.
Come on.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.101
Come on, Reiger.
Come on.
                 No, no, I'm not
                        bettin'.

17:18.203 --> 17:22.105
I got $5,200 in cash, Reiger.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.940
I got $2,400 here,

17:24.009 --> 17:25.942
I got $2,400 here,

17:26.011 --> 17:28.378
I got a hundred dollars here
   and a hundred dollars here

17:28.445 --> 17:31.448
and $200 in Chase Manhattan.

17:31.516 --> 17:33.751
Cash, huh?

17:33.852 --> 17:35.018
Cash.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.286
I gotta warn ya, Louie...

17:36.354 --> 17:37.821
Tony's kid is pretty good.

17:38.823 --> 17:40.691
He is?
                           Yeah.

17:40.758 --> 17:43.160
How long's Banta
       been training him?

17:43.228 --> 17:44.461
A couple of weeks.

17:44.529 --> 17:45.929
Please!

17:47.765 --> 17:48.699
All right, Louie.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.434
I'm gonna take you
                     up on this.

17:50.502 --> 17:51.435
You know why?

17:51.503 --> 17:52.536
Because you're
                     gonna lose.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.004
That's right, Louie.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.806
And this time, you're gonna
              pay up every dime,

17:55.874 --> 17:57.374
you understand?
                     Every dime.
        Thanks, Reiger.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.675
Thanks. Thank you.

17:58.743 --> 18:00.343
Come on, let's go
        get Terry ready.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.646
All right,
before you go, uh,

18:02.714 --> 18:05.315
can I offer a little
locker room prayer?

18:05.383 --> 18:07.317
Come on, Louie.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.824
May the fighters
fight fair,

18:14.893 --> 18:17.827
may no one be hurt,

18:17.896 --> 18:20.830
and may the best man win.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.833
Well, that was very nice.
                           Yeah.

18:27.405 --> 18:29.339
They're gone, God.
       Let's talk bucks!

18:29.407 --> 18:31.741
Bucks!

18:31.843 --> 18:34.177
Okay, you fellas
        know the rules.

18:34.246 --> 18:36.179
I want-- I want you
        to shake hands,

18:36.248 --> 18:38.249
go to your corners,
  and when you hear the bell,

18:38.316 --> 18:39.516
come out fighting.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.019
Okay, Terry, this is the start
        of somethin' big for us.

18:43.087 --> 18:44.020
I can feel it.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.288
Go out there and
                   get this guy.

18:45.356 --> 18:46.490
Get him. Get him.

18:46.558 --> 18:47.691
(bell dings)

18:47.792 --> 18:48.692
Get him, Terry, get him.

18:48.759 --> 18:49.859
Look bad, now.

18:49.927 --> 18:52.396
Jab, jab, jab, jab!

18:52.464 --> 18:53.797
With your left hand!

18:53.865 --> 18:54.798
Left hand!
Jab, jab, baby.

18:54.865 --> 18:55.966
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

18:56.034 --> 18:57.667
You're bad, man,
you're bad.

18:57.735 --> 18:58.768
Get him, now,
get him.

18:58.803 --> 19:00.137
Get him, man.
             Ootch!

19:00.204 --> 19:01.705
Don't say ootch! Get him.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.140
Jab, jab.

19:03.207 --> 19:05.709
He looks bad;
he looks bad.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.111
Use that right now.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.346
Throw your, throw your,
throw your, throw your...

19:09.414 --> 19:10.514
Right!
   Your right!

19:10.582 --> 19:12.316
Get him! Get him!

19:12.350 --> 19:14.051
All right, baby, get him!
You're the king, man.

19:14.152 --> 19:16.019
You'll get him!
You're the best.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.856
(whistling, cheering
         and applause)

19:22.360 --> 19:24.028
(shouting)

19:24.162 --> 19:25.529
TONY:
Get him off you.

19:25.597 --> 19:26.897
He's on you now.

19:26.998 --> 19:29.333
(Tony shouting)

19:29.335 --> 19:32.135
Jab, jab, jab!

19:32.203 --> 19:33.904
(cheering and applause
           continues)

19:40.679 --> 19:42.913
REFEREE:
                          Two...

19:42.947 --> 19:45.149
three... four...

19:45.250 --> 19:48.485
five... six...

19:48.553 --> 19:51.221
seven... eight...

19:51.356 --> 19:52.923
nine... ten!

19:53.024 --> 19:54.257
(whistling, cheering
         and applause)

19:59.397 --> 20:01.164
(knocking on door)

20:01.232 --> 20:02.332
Yeah, who is it?

20:02.400 --> 20:03.367
MAN:
          This is the syndicate.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.436
We want to speak
                       to Terry.

20:05.503 --> 20:07.438
It's the syndicate.

20:07.505 --> 20:09.440
Let them in.
    I'll handle those goons.

20:09.507 --> 20:10.374
TONY (quietly):
Back.
                      Here.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.787
You're the syndicate?

20:23.855 --> 20:25.922
Uh, actually we're
a medical corporation

20:25.990 --> 20:29.092
looking
for investments.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.094
My name is
                    Dr. Frazier.

20:31.162 --> 20:32.295
I'm an ophthalmologist.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.798
This is, uh, Dr. Gilman,
obstetrics.

20:34.865 --> 20:36.466
How you doin'?

20:36.534 --> 20:38.535
Dr. Baker, ears,
nose and throat.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.105
Dr. Stokley,
              internal medicine.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.306
STOKLEY:
                    I specialize

20:43.408 --> 20:45.108
in diseases of
                   the pancreas.

20:45.176 --> 20:47.143
And this is Dr. Harden.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.145
That was quite
                     a knockout.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.147
I've never seen anybody
                go out like that

20:51.216 --> 20:52.949
and I'm an
               anesthesiologist.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.487
Uh, Terry, now, look,

20:57.589 --> 21:00.223
uh, we don't want to
          take advantage of you.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.559
We're willing to split all
             your winnings 90/10

21:02.627 --> 21:04.027
in your favor.

21:04.095 --> 21:05.528
All we want out of
                this arrangement

21:05.597 --> 21:06.964
is front row seats,

21:06.998 --> 21:09.699
a good tax break, and a
      chance to delude ourselves

21:09.767 --> 21:11.701
that we're part of
               the sports scene.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.538
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.939
Terry, look,
              we're offering you

21:15.974 --> 21:18.475
a very good
                guaranteed wage,

21:18.509 --> 21:20.777
plus a full expense account,
          a rent-free apartment,

21:20.845 --> 21:23.614
all the best training and
        all the best facilities.

21:23.681 --> 21:26.617
We want what's best
                 for you, Terry.

21:26.684 --> 21:28.351
Yo, see, it's not up to me,
            anyway.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.387
It's up to my manager.
       Right.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.390
Of course, now, we ain't got
         no contract...

21:35.393 --> 21:37.461
...but we did shake hands.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.296
We did shake hands,
  didn't we?

21:39.330 --> 21:41.165
Lots of times.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.168
Hey, you know...

21:44.235 --> 21:47.037
Tone, you tell
                  me what to do.

21:53.211 --> 21:55.812
I guess you gotta listen
to 'em, Terry.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.481
I mean, they're startin'
to make sense.

21:57.549 --> 21:58.615
I mean, bread helps.

21:58.683 --> 22:00.350
And with me,
all it's gonna be

22:00.418 --> 22:02.852
is a bunch of lousy hotels,
scrounging and scraping.

22:02.920 --> 22:03.987
You deserve better.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.823
We don't want
                    to leave you

22:06.891 --> 22:08.291
out in the cold either,
                      Mr. Banta.

22:08.359 --> 22:09.593
We've talked it over

22:09.661 --> 22:11.528
and we would like to
      buy Terry's contract

22:11.596 --> 22:12.462
from you.
        Sure.

22:12.530 --> 22:13.797
You're talkin'
about my future, man.

22:13.898 --> 22:15.365
You're talkin'
about dreams.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.901
I mean, you're talkin' about
the one chance I had in my life

22:17.969 --> 22:19.002
to be somebody.

22:19.069 --> 22:20.303
What price could you
put on that?

22:20.371 --> 22:22.239
How about $5,000?

22:22.340 --> 22:23.140
That's plenty.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.446
Uh, pardon me.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.782
I have a debt to pay
       to this gentleman.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.117
Oh, yeah, would you
excuse us?

22:34.185 --> 22:35.786
A little business.

22:35.853 --> 22:38.121
Take it and die!

22:38.189 --> 22:41.024
Die! Die! Die! Die!

22:41.091 --> 22:44.194
Die! Die with
                 festering boil.

22:44.262 --> 22:46.696
Die! Die! Die!

22:53.437 --> 22:55.372
I'm sorry to interrupt.

23:06.517 --> 23:08.685
Tone, you sure
       this is all right?

23:08.786 --> 23:11.488
Terry, I think you made
the right move.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.657
But, listen, this means
I get ringside seats

23:13.725 --> 23:15.792
to every one of your fights,
including the title.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.694
You got it, man.
All right, bro.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.531
Hey, you keep
punching, baby.
                   All right.

23:21.599 --> 23:22.899
Great fight, uh,
                    great fight.
           Hey.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.901
All right.

23:27.238 --> 23:29.172
What a guy.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.209
Oh, my God.

23:33.277 --> 23:34.210
Oh, baby.

23:34.278 --> 23:36.380
Tony, here we are
                   standing here

23:36.447 --> 23:38.715
with 10,000 bucks
                     between us.

23:38.783 --> 23:39.983
(giggling):
Yeah.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.151
We ought to have the greatest
               meal of our life.

23:42.219 --> 23:43.386
Yeah.

23:43.454 --> 23:45.422
Where do you
                    want to eat?
How about Mario's?

23:45.490 --> 23:47.357
Perfect.

23:57.835 --> 24:00.103
(theme song playing)

24:23.661 --> 24:24.995
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>
