WEBVTT

05:26.536 --> 05:30.331
1839

05:57.483 --> 05:59.944
That one wants us to sail them back.

06:00.069 --> 06:04.115
That one thinks he can sail
all the way back without us.

06:35.855 --> 06:38.816
Yes. East. To the sun.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.986
I understand. You can trust me.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.089
To Africa.

08:11.409 --> 08:14.620
Well, I have to tack, don't I?
Tack. You'd rather I didn't.

08:14.829 --> 08:19.083
You want to get there? I have to tack.

09:00.875 --> 09:04.170
You're going to get us killed.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.473
Yea, yea, yea, now go take a bath.

11:24.769 --> 11:26.771
We have to signal them.

11:26.896 --> 11:32.735
When the ship gets close, he'll run and hide.
Then we both start yelling.

11:37.490 --> 11:40.242
They'll search the ship.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.974
Get ready.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.664
Six Weeks

13:48.037 --> 13:50.039
Dolly!

13:51.665 --> 13:53.292
Dolly!

15:03.487 --> 15:05.447
Carry on, Mr. Packwood!

15:06.115 --> 15:07.866
Aye, aye, sir!

15:07.950 --> 15:10.119
Straight ahead!

15:35.603 --> 15:36.979
Fire over their heads!

16:01.629 --> 16:02.630
Steady on.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.084
Open the gate!

17:26.588 --> 17:28.966
Come on, come on, come on!

17:40.853 --> 17:43.480
- Move along!
- Come on, let's go!

17:44.898 --> 17:47.025
Move along!

17:47.860 --> 17:51.071
- Forward! Come on!
- Keep it going!

18:03.167 --> 18:05.335
Come along! Get moving!

18:06.086 --> 18:10.132
- Don't stop there! Keep moving!
- Make way for the stinking heathens!

18:10.215 --> 18:12.384
All right, move on.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.053
Lock 'em up!

18:32.863 --> 18:35.365
Gates! Gates! Gates!

18:40.662 --> 18:42.456
Push 'em in!

19:40.138 --> 19:45.102
Isabella II, Queen of Spain

20:01.410 --> 20:03.453
Your Royal Highness.

20:03.662 --> 20:06.790
Something's happened.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.629
- Thank you...
- Mr. President, sir.

20:12.796 --> 20:16.800
The ambassador to Spain, <i>Señor</i> Calderon.
Martin Van Buren, 8th President of the United States

20:16.884 --> 20:18.886
- What?
<i>- Señor</i> Calderon.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.346
- Yes, all right. Not now. Not now.
- Ambassador...

20:21.430 --> 20:23.390
It appears to be a matter
of certain importance, sir.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.474
God bless!

20:32.441 --> 20:38.071
I'm trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day.

20:38.155 --> 20:41.867
I understand. I simply wasn't certain
whether this was something

20:41.950 --> 20:45.621
- you wanted to take care of personally.
- Leder, there are, what,

20:45.704 --> 20:48.081
three, four million Negroes
in this country?

20:48.165 --> 20:52.252
Why on Earth should I concern myself
with these 44?

20:53.003 --> 20:54.504
Well, there are reasons.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.966
I don't care how. You just take care of it.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.555
The ship is the <i>Amistad.</i>

21:05.015 --> 21:08.268
It's too small to be
a transatlantic slaver.

21:08.352 --> 21:11.396
So, they're plantation slaves, then?
West Indians?

21:11.521 --> 21:16.443
Not necessarily.
At least they certainly don't look it.

21:16.526 --> 21:19.863
Not from the glimpse I caught of them
on their way to jail.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.824
They have these scars.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.285
- Scars?
- Yeah.

21:42.010 --> 21:46.264
They were first detained by officers of a
survey brig off the coast of Long Island.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.726
They were conveyed to New Haven,
under what authority, I don't know,

21:49.810 --> 21:52.020
and given over to the local constabulary.

21:52.104 --> 21:55.732
About 40 of them,
including four or five children.

22:03.699 --> 22:06.201
The arraignment is day after tomorrow.

22:06.284 --> 22:09.162
I can only assume
that the charge is murder.

22:09.246 --> 22:12.791
I'll see what I can do about that.

22:12.874 --> 22:17.921
Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.425
At the very least,
make sure they have good counsel.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.342
Chief!

23:05.343 --> 23:06.344
Chief! Chief!

23:08.805 --> 23:11.016
He's not a chief.

23:11.641 --> 23:12.683
Brother!

23:12.684 --> 23:14.311
Brother! Brother!

23:15.270 --> 23:17.647
He's not your brother.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.650
What is he then?

23:20.901 --> 23:23.528
He's a white man.

23:24.321 --> 23:25.781
<i>Hear ye, hear ye.</i>

23:25.864 --> 23:28.283
<i>In the matter of the district court
of the United States of America</i>

23:28.366 --> 23:30.744
in this, the year of our Lord, 1839,

23:30.827 --> 23:33.830
the honorable
Andrew T. Juttson presiding.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.900
If it please Your Honor.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.195
The bench recognizes
District Attorney Holabird.

24:06.822 --> 24:11.159
I would like to present the court,
Your Honor, with the charges

24:11.243 --> 24:13.829
- of piracy and murder against the...
- Your Honor, I have a petition

24:13.912 --> 24:16.623
- for a writ of habeas corpus.
- Your Honor, I was speaking.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.543
Yes, I know, Mr. Holabird.
You were reading charges, which,

24:19.626 --> 24:21.837
whatever they might be,
will be rendered moot by this writ.

24:21.920 --> 24:25.757
That petition for a writ, Mr. Tappan,
if, indeed, that's what it is, is moot

24:25.841 --> 24:28.343
unless and until an actual writ

24:28.426 --> 24:31.513
by some higher court,
by some miracle, is granted.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.473
Mr. Holabird is correct, Mr. Tappan.

24:33.557 --> 24:36.143
And if you would, sir,
while I know it is your custom,

24:36.226 --> 24:39.104
please, kindly refrain
from impersonating a lawyer,

24:39.187 --> 24:40.981
which you patently are not.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.774
As I was saying, Your Honor...

24:42.858 --> 24:43.984
Your Honor.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.488
Mr. Secretary.

24:48.655 --> 24:52.617
Your Honor, I am here on behalf of the President of the
United States, U.S. Secretary of State John Forsyth

24:53.910 --> 24:57.455
representing the claims of Her Majesty,
Queen Isabella of Spain,

24:57.581 --> 25:01.585
as concerns our mutual treaty
on the high seas of 1795.

25:01.668 --> 25:04.129
- You have my attention, sir.
- Thank you.

25:04.421 --> 25:08.216
These slaves, Your Honor,
are by rights the property of Spain,

25:08.300 --> 25:10.468
and as such,
under Article 9 of said treaty

25:10.552 --> 25:12.888
are to be returned posthaste.

25:12.971 --> 25:16.016
Said treaty taking precedence
over all other claims and jurisdictions.

25:16.099 --> 25:19.019
Them slaves belong
to me and my mate, Your Majesty.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.687
Your Honor, I have not yet read the...

25:20.770 --> 25:22.314
Who be you two gentlemen?

25:22.480 --> 25:25.859
"We, Thomas R. Gedney
and Richard W. Meade,

25:25.942 --> 25:28.612
"whilst commissioned
US Naval officers,

25:28.695 --> 25:32.699
"stand before this court
as private citizens,

25:32.782 --> 25:34.951
"and do hereby claim salvage
on the high seas

25:35.035 --> 25:39.664
"of the Spanish ship <i>La Amistad</i>
and all her cargo."

25:40.165 --> 25:42.542
- Here you go, sir.
- Your Honor...

25:42.626 --> 25:47.130
You wish to make this claim
above that of the Queen of Spain?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.883
Where was she, pray,
when we was fightin' the winds

25:49.966 --> 25:52.677
to bring this vessel in, Your... Honor.

25:53.136 --> 25:57.307
Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,
was busy ruling a country.

25:57.891 --> 26:01.102
Your Honor, these officers'
claims are just...

26:01.186 --> 26:03.647
Your Honor!

26:05.106 --> 26:09.069
Here are the true owners
of these slaves.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.531
- Order! Order in this court!
- On their behalf,

26:13.615 --> 26:17.827
I am in possession of a receipt
for purchase executed in Havana, Cuba,

26:18.203 --> 26:21.289
June 26, 1839,

26:21.373 --> 26:26.169
I do hereby call upon this court
to immediately surrender

26:27.504 --> 26:29.005
these goods

26:32.092 --> 26:35.011
and that ship out there to my clients,

26:35.095 --> 26:37.097
- Jose Ruiz...
<i>- Yo soy Ruiz.</i>

26:37.180 --> 26:41.017
"Yoso" Ruiz, and... Pedro Montes?
Pedro Montes.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.445
Mr. Tappan. How do you do, sir?

26:52.529 --> 26:56.199
My name is Roger S. Baldwin,
attorney-at-law.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.450
Real estate attorney?

26:57.534 --> 27:00.912
Real estate, inventories
and other contestable assets, sir.

27:00.996 --> 27:02.872
Can I help you with something?

27:02.956 --> 27:05.208
Well, I don't know.
What is it that you do?

27:06.376 --> 27:09.546
Well, I own various businesses
and banks.

27:10.213 --> 27:14.676
Well, as a matter of fact, you probably
could help me, Mr. Tappan.

27:14.843 --> 27:17.929
But that's not why I'm here.
You see, I'd like to help you.

27:18.013 --> 27:21.516
- Me?
- Yes. I deal with property, Mr. Tappan.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.184
And sometimes
I get people's property back for them,

27:23.268 --> 27:24.436
and other times I get it taken away,

27:24.519 --> 27:26.813
as in this case,
which is clearly a property issue.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.148
You see, all of the claims here,

27:28.231 --> 27:30.525
every single one of them,
speaks to the issue of ownership.

27:30.608 --> 27:34.237
- Thank you very much, Mr. Baldwin.
- Baldwin, Roger S. Attorney-at-law.

27:35.822 --> 27:39.242
But I'm afraid what's needed here
is a criminal attorney.

27:39.326 --> 27:42.162
A trial lawyer.
But thanks for your interest.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.622
Yes. Well,

27:44.706 --> 27:49.794
intending no disrespect, Mr. Tappan,
but if that were the way to go,

27:49.878 --> 27:52.547
well, then, quite frankly,

27:52.630 --> 27:55.091
I wouldn't have bothered coming
down here, would I have?

28:00.513 --> 28:03.808
Goodbye. I bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.479
In closing,

28:07.562 --> 28:10.648
I call upon our distinguished
colleague from Massachusetts,

28:10.732 --> 28:13.777
Representative John Quincy Adams,

28:13.860 --> 28:17.530
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt

28:17.614 --> 28:21.368
to convert this eccentric bequest of,

28:21.451 --> 28:25.163
let's be frank,
a bunch of junk of one James Smithson,

28:25.246 --> 28:29.376
into a so-called institute
of national treasure!

28:33.421 --> 28:36.174
Perhaps Mr. Adams
is meditating on his response.

28:48.186 --> 28:50.188
Had I thought your remarks worthy of

28:50.271 --> 28:53.608
any kind of riposte,
Representative Pickney,

28:53.691 --> 28:58.238
be assured you'd have heard from me
hours ago.

28:59.531 --> 29:00.907
Who?

29:00.990 --> 29:03.493
Mr. Tappan. Lewis Tappan.

29:03.701 --> 29:04.911
Yeah?

29:06.329 --> 29:08.706
I must see him?
I'm required to see him?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.750
No, of course not, sir.
He requests an audience.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.919
Give me a hand.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.255
He requests, does he?

29:15.338 --> 29:19.092
Yeah. I don't know
anyone called Tappan.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.969
Yes, sir, you do.
You've met him on countless occasions.

29:21.052 --> 29:24.097
Where? Where is he?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.808
He's right over there, sir.
Right there, sir.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.603
What is that?

29:30.687 --> 29:31.980
- Where?
- Right there, sir.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.191
Lewis! Good to see you again!

29:35.275 --> 29:36.985
And you, sir.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.946
- This is Theodore Joadson.
- How do you do, sir?

29:40.029 --> 29:43.491
- An honor to meet you, sir.
- Yeah.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.412
- Sir? Is there somewhere we could...
- What? Let's stroll in the garden.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.747
- This way, sir.
- What?

29:49.831 --> 29:52.041
Let go of my arm. Over here.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.383
I believe this case
has great significance, sir.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.136
Our Secretary of State has already
deemed it worthy of his attention.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.805
- You don't have to shout. Stop shouting.
- No. Yes.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.849
Well, he's supported
the Queen of Spain

30:07.932 --> 30:10.518
in her claims
that the Africans belong to her.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.687
And then there are others
making claims as well.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.439
- Two sailors...
- What season is it?

30:14.522 --> 30:17.150
- Pardon?
- I said, what season is it?

30:17.233 --> 30:19.068
I don't understand what you mean.

30:19.152 --> 30:23.573
There are two ways of knowing for
certain without consulting a calendar.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.493
The leaves on the maple trees
have all gone and the fact that

30:26.576 --> 30:31.206
the President is not at home over there
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.792
Tell me, sir, you really think

30:34.876 --> 30:39.839
Van Buren cares about the whims
of an 11-year-old girl who wears a tiara?

30:39.923 --> 30:43.843
'Cause I can assure you, sir,
having been over there,

30:43.927 --> 30:46.429
only one thing occupies his thoughts
this time of the year,

30:46.513 --> 30:47.722
being all things to all people,

30:47.805 --> 30:49.974
which, of course,
means be nothing to no one.

30:50.058 --> 30:53.686
In other words,
gettin' himself re-elected.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.730
Give me a hand.

31:03.363 --> 31:05.782
- Will you help us, sir?
- Let go of my arm.

31:06.950 --> 31:09.702
Take my stick.

31:09.786 --> 31:12.830
- Mr. Adams?
- Yeah, what?

31:12.914 --> 31:17.669
As an advocate for
the abolition of slavery, will you help us?

31:17.752 --> 31:19.921
I'm neither friend nor foe
of the abolitionist cause.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.464
No, I won't help you.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.300
Sir.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.135
What?

31:26.219 --> 31:28.304
I know you, Mr. President.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.848
I know you and your presidency
as well as any man

31:30.932 --> 31:32.850
and your father's.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.604
You were a child at his side
when he helped invent America.

31:36.688 --> 31:41.025
And you, in turn, have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention.

31:41.109 --> 31:44.362
There remains but one task undone,
one vital task

31:44.445 --> 31:46.698
the founding fathers left to their sons

31:46.781 --> 31:51.369
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called United States.

31:51.452 --> 31:56.291
And that task, sir, as you well know,
is crushing slavery.

31:56.374 --> 31:59.335
Your record confirms
you're an abolitionist, sir,

31:59.419 --> 32:01.212
even if you won't.

32:01.296 --> 32:04.340
- And whether or not you admit it...
- Mr. Joadson.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.344
...you belong with us.

32:10.305 --> 32:13.600
You're quite the scholar,
Mr. Joadson, aren't ya?

32:13.683 --> 32:15.018
Quite the historian.

32:19.272 --> 32:23.526
Let me tell you something
about that quality, if I might.

32:23.610 --> 32:28.615
Without an accompanying mastery of
at least one-tenth its measure of grace,

32:28.698 --> 32:32.160
such erudition is worthless, sir.

32:32.702 --> 32:35.496
Now, you take it from one who knows.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.543
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.174
We know we aimed high
coming to see you, sir, but...

32:46.257 --> 32:48.676
Well, aim lower!

32:48.760 --> 32:52.180
Find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms

32:52.263 --> 32:54.223
the more you lose.

32:58.811 --> 33:03.650
If the court awards them to Spain,
they'll be taken to Cuba and executed.

33:03.733 --> 33:08.363
If the two lieutenants prevail,
they'll most likely sell them to Spain

33:08.446 --> 33:10.490
and they'll be executed.

33:10.573 --> 33:13.117
If Montes and Ruiz
are successful in their campaign...

33:13.201 --> 33:17.038
I'm a little confused by something.
What are they worth to you?

33:17.413 --> 33:19.040
We're discussing the case,
not its expense.

33:19.123 --> 33:20.625
The case, of course.

33:22.168 --> 33:26.547
Well, the case is much simpler
than you think, Mr. Tappan.

33:26.631 --> 33:30.259
It's like anything, isn't it? Land,
livestock, heirlooms, what have you.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.012
Livestock.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.849
Yes. Consider,

33:36.933 --> 33:41.354
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves,

33:41.437 --> 33:43.773
as on the plantation.

33:44.941 --> 33:47.485
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.071
- So, are they?
- "Are they?"

33:50.238 --> 33:53.741
Yes. Born slaves, as on a plantation.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.744
No, we're not certain,
but we very much doubt it.

33:56.828 --> 34:00.206
Well, let's say they are, and if they are,
then they are possessions,

34:00.289 --> 34:03.251
and no more deserving of a criminal
trial than a bookcase or a plow.

34:03.334 --> 34:04.919
Then we can all go home, can't we?

34:05.002 --> 34:06.713
Now, on the other hand,
let's say they aren't slaves.

34:06.796 --> 34:09.757
If they aren't slaves, then they were
illegally acquired, weren't they?

34:10.174 --> 34:12.510
Forget mutiny, forget piracy,
forget murder and all the rest.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.304
Those are subsequent,
irrelevant occurrences.

34:15.388 --> 34:18.808
Ignore everything
but the pre-eminent issue at hand.

34:18.891 --> 34:22.018
The wrongful transfer of stolen goods.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.188
- Either way, we win.
- Sir,

34:25.063 --> 34:28.693
this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness.

34:29.569 --> 34:31.195
The what?

34:31.279 --> 34:34.532
It would be against everything I stand for
to let this deteriorate into

34:34.614 --> 34:38.202
an exercise in
the vagaries of legal minutia.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.621
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about, Mr. Tappan,

34:41.706 --> 34:43.166
but I'm talking about
the heart of the matter.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.625
As am I.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.918
It is our destiny

34:47.003 --> 34:51.632
as abolitionists and as Christians
to save these people.

34:51.716 --> 34:54.051
These are people, Mr. Baldwin.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.678
Not livestock.

34:55.762 --> 34:59.098
Did Christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities?

34:59.182 --> 35:02.852
He went to the cross, nobly.
You know why?

35:04.020 --> 35:05.855
To make a statement.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.567
To make a statement, as must we.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.989
But Christ lost.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.492
- You, I think...
- No, sir, he did not.

35:18.326 --> 35:20.620
Or, at least you, Mr. Joadson,
want to win, don't you?

35:20.703 --> 35:22.914
- Yes.
- I certainly do.

35:23.039 --> 35:26.292
Hell, sometimes
I don't get paid unless I do.

35:26.375 --> 35:30.797
Which brings us back to
the earlier question of worth.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.423
Now, in order to do a better job than

35:32.507 --> 35:34.133
the attorney who represented
the Son of God,

35:34.217 --> 35:37.053
I'll require $2.50 a day.

35:49.899 --> 35:52.276
Who are they, do you think?

35:57.573 --> 36:01.327
Looks like they're going to be sick.

36:09.836 --> 36:12.588
They're entertainers.

36:12.964 --> 36:17.385
...but why do they look so miserable?

36:38.364 --> 36:40.491
You don't belong here.

36:40.867 --> 36:43.828
Your table doesn't belong here.

36:51.335 --> 36:54.171
This is Temne land.

36:58.134 --> 37:02.054
How do you do, sir? How do you do?

37:02.555 --> 37:05.474
You want to sit?
Sit over here in Mendeland.

37:05.766 --> 37:08.102
What are you doing, Temne?

37:08.436 --> 37:12.732
You want trouble?
Cross into our territory again.

37:13.065 --> 37:16.402
What is this?
Get this table out of here.

37:16.569 --> 37:18.571
Let me show you to Sherbroland.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.793
There?

37:59.195 --> 38:01.989
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

38:03.741 --> 38:06.285
Excuse me. I...

38:06.369 --> 38:07.620
My name is Roger Baldwin.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.455
This is Theodore Joadson
of the Anti-Slavery Society

38:09.538 --> 38:12.583
and owner of
the Forten Shipping Service.

38:12.667 --> 38:16.462
And this is Professor Gibbs, a linguist.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.548
What do you want?

38:20.716 --> 38:23.386
Keep talking. Get them to talk.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.430
Have you seen this before?

38:26.514 --> 38:30.267
I could kill you with my bare hands
before you raise that sword shoulder high.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.436
This belongs to you?

38:32.561 --> 38:33.562
Does this...

38:37.233 --> 38:39.276
No. No.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.991
I need to know where you're from.

38:53.582 --> 38:55.292
What did he say?

38:55.835 --> 38:59.505
I didn't understand a word of it. It's gibberish.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.924
- He said, I think, "Show me the map."
- Yes.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.260
What do you think? Is he here to help us? Or?

39:04.427 --> 39:06.095
I don't know.

39:07.263 --> 39:11.267
He reminds me of that Fula of Baoma, you know the one--

39:11.684 --> 39:14.770
...who hires himself out to scrape
elephant dung from the crop rows.

39:14.854 --> 39:20.317
A dung-scraper might be just the
kind of man we need right now.

39:20.943 --> 39:23.946
Here, Africa, is this where you're from?

39:24.030 --> 39:26.240
Africa.

39:26.323 --> 39:27.616
What does he want?

39:27.867 --> 39:30.286
He's an idiot. He just likes to hear himself speak.

39:30.995 --> 39:33.873
Were you born in the West Indies?

39:34.040 --> 39:38.127
Were you born in the West Indies?

39:39.879 --> 39:42.631
All three of them are idiots.

39:43.758 --> 39:45.176
What did he say?

39:45.259 --> 39:48.971
He said they have to go away.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.313
- There they are!
- Damnation is God's way!

39:57.396 --> 40:00.858
You cannot own another human being!

40:00.941 --> 40:03.360
- Killers of white men!
- Slavery is tyranny!

40:03.444 --> 40:07.364
Look, it's those miserable-looking people again.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.081
God's blessing on you this morning.

40:15.164 --> 40:18.125
I'm not afraid of you, or your medicine.

40:18.209 --> 40:23.005
Yes. You place your hand on this book,
and I'll pray for you.

40:24.882 --> 40:27.718
They're human beings, not animals!

40:28.803 --> 40:30.846
Slavery will kill this country!

40:35.017 --> 40:38.687
Then, in the quietude of the night,

40:38.771 --> 40:40.940
after the Spaniards
attended their vespers,

40:41.023 --> 40:43.943
and were deep in virtuous sleep,

40:45.528 --> 40:48.948
the savages broke loose their collars

40:49.031 --> 40:53.744
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey,

40:53.828 --> 40:57.456
where they fell upon the unsuspecting
crew with these sabers and cane knives.

40:58.791 --> 41:02.128
I cannot overstate
the inhumanity of their acts...

41:02.211 --> 41:04.505
Have you figured out who he is?

41:04.588 --> 41:05.798
...the savagery, the bloodshed.

41:05.881 --> 41:07.591
An advisor of some kind. Maybe theirs.

41:07.675 --> 41:09.635
Unsated by the mere deaths
of their victims,

41:09.718 --> 41:11.804
they went on to mutilate
at least one of them...

41:11.887 --> 41:13.806
What about him?

41:13.889 --> 41:16.100
...to dismember him.
The simple cook, a Creole.

41:16.183 --> 41:17.184
Their own kind.

41:17.268 --> 41:19.019
Theirs maybe.

41:19.103 --> 41:21.564
But for the bravery
of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes,

41:21.647 --> 41:22.982
who fought their way to the stern

41:23.065 --> 41:25.067
and steered the <i>Amistad</i>
to these shores,

41:25.151 --> 41:27.278
under constant threat of like fate,

41:27.361 --> 41:29.446
we might never have
heard of this massacre,

41:29.530 --> 41:30.823
this bloodbath.

41:30.906 --> 41:32.658
But for their bravery,

41:32.741 --> 41:36.078
these villains most certainly
would have escaped justice.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.998
But they've not. They've not.

41:43.544 --> 41:46.547
And Dung-Scraper?

41:46.839 --> 41:51.218
I have a horrible feeling he talks for us.

42:05.107 --> 42:09.028
Do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage?

42:10.362 --> 42:13.240
A brick and a bear?

42:13.324 --> 42:18.078
Or how about
a polecat and a President?

42:20.915 --> 42:21.999
Well, the Spanish government hopes

42:22.082 --> 42:23.876
you don't have a whole lot more
common sense than that.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.211
And I'll tell you why.

42:25.294 --> 42:28.547
This case isn't about murder,
mayhem or massacres.

42:28.631 --> 42:30.841
It's not about anything that dramatic.

42:31.258 --> 42:36.555
This case is about knowing
the difference between here and there.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.978
I want to show you something.

42:53.322 --> 42:54.823
Open your mouth.

42:55.449 --> 42:56.617
Of course, he doesn't
understand what I'm saying

42:56.700 --> 42:58.077
because he doesn't speak English.

43:02.414 --> 43:03.874
Doesn't he understand that?

43:03.958 --> 43:05.417
I thought he was born
on a Cuban plantation.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.086
That's what they're all saying.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.463
Perhaps he simply just
doesn't like you, Mr. Baldwin.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.840
He wouldn't be the first, Mr. Holabird.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.020
Yes.

43:25.104 --> 43:28.857
What, did he learn this on some Cuban
plantation, this decorative effect?

43:34.738 --> 43:36.699
Cuban plantation.

43:38.867 --> 43:41.412
Stand up. Stand up.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.247
Hey.

44:02.141 --> 44:04.310
Stand up.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.397
Thank you.

44:09.106 --> 44:11.900
Your Honor, I speak more Spanish,
and I was born in Philadelphia.

44:11.984 --> 44:15.821
Your Honor, on Spanish plantations,
slaves always choose to live

44:15.904 --> 44:19.116
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages.

44:19.199 --> 44:23.912
Pray tell, what need they know
of Spanish? Fetch? Carry? Stop?

44:23.996 --> 44:29.001
Ofttimes, gestures suffice for slaves, as,
indeed, for any other beast of burden.

44:29.084 --> 44:30.544
Your Honor.

44:31.628 --> 44:35.090
I represent the interests
of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes.

44:35.758 --> 44:37.009
I remember.

44:37.092 --> 44:41.347
I have a bill of sale issued in Havana
for the purchase of slaves.

44:41.430 --> 44:43.515
I remember that, too.

44:43.599 --> 44:47.853
On it, in addition to the amounts paid
for each, are their names.

44:47.936 --> 44:52.191
Jose, Bernardo, Paco and so on.

44:53.692 --> 44:57.488
On behalf of my clients,
I submit this document to the court.

45:05.871 --> 45:08.874
Mr. Baldwin, you've proffered
to this court this morning

45:08.957 --> 45:12.586
a good deal of, I'll be kind,
circumstantial evidence.

45:12.878 --> 45:17.383
Have you, in addition, anything, say,
in the order of actual documentation

45:17.466 --> 45:19.218
that might refute this one,

45:19.301 --> 45:22.388
and in so doing,
more compellingly support your claims?

45:22.471 --> 45:26.100
I'm sure I could manufacture some
as easily as they have, Your Honor,

45:26.183 --> 45:27.267
if that would suffice.

45:27.351 --> 45:29.561
But what you're saying is,
then, you don't.

45:29.645 --> 45:31.605
Is that correct?

45:40.280 --> 45:42.074
I have them.

45:42.866 --> 45:45.369
I'm afraid that does not impress me.

45:56.672 --> 45:58.006
I thought you did quite well.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.093
You do?

46:01.176 --> 46:04.847
Much better than I expected,
to be honest.

46:04.930 --> 46:06.723
Well, thank you, I think.

46:06.807 --> 46:09.518
Although, I was concerned for a moment
that you might've forgotten

46:09.601 --> 46:11.353
that this is just a case like any other.

46:11.603 --> 46:13.230
Well, you needn't worry about that.

46:13.856 --> 46:15.441
That's good.

46:34.918 --> 46:37.754
Hello, Cinque.
My name is Roger Baldwin.

46:37.838 --> 46:39.965
I'll be your attorney.

46:55.397 --> 46:58.233
Yes. Thank you.

47:07.910 --> 47:09.870
All right.

47:14.208 --> 47:17.127
I need to prove where you're from.

47:17.211 --> 47:20.547
You want to show them where we're from.

47:23.675 --> 47:26.386
How are you supposed to tell me? I...

47:28.931 --> 47:32.935
How can I explain to you where we're from?

47:37.523 --> 47:38.524
Maybe, I -

47:38.607 --> 47:39.691
Listen, why don't I... You go.

47:39.775 --> 47:44.154
I'm sorry, you should talk first.

47:58.001 --> 48:01.338
Here. This is where I'm from.

48:01.421 --> 48:03.340
Here. This.

48:03.423 --> 48:07.844
All of this. All of this is...

48:07.928 --> 48:09.179
That's here.

48:09.263 --> 48:10.681
...my home.

48:11.223 --> 48:12.349
Here.

48:20.315 --> 48:22.776
Cuba. Cuba's an island.

48:34.162 --> 48:37.249
The <i>Amistad.</i> This is where you...

48:37.332 --> 48:41.086
Where everyone was killed. Here.

48:42.045 --> 48:43.922
Cuba, the <i>Amistad.</i>

48:44.006 --> 48:47.384
Now, Cuba, is this your home?
I don't think so.

48:48.051 --> 48:50.262
But... Excuse me.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.517
Now...

49:01.607 --> 49:03.150
Africa.

49:03.233 --> 49:06.236
This is your home, isn't it?

49:06.320 --> 49:11.533
This is your home. Yes?

49:12.534 --> 49:18.415
You came all the way from here.

49:46.568 --> 49:48.277
This...

49:48.278 --> 49:51.406
This... Is how far I've come.

50:15.847 --> 50:18.141
Secure the barrels for transport.

50:23.980 --> 50:26.108
Put your backs into it, boys. Come on.

50:26.483 --> 50:28.276
This is a court order
granting us permission to board

50:28.360 --> 50:31.113
and search this vessel
for evidential purposes.

50:31.196 --> 50:32.447
What did they want?

50:32.531 --> 50:33.657
To come aboard.

50:33.740 --> 50:37.911
I informed them they needed to obtain
one of these, an authentic one.

50:46.628 --> 50:48.547
Aren't you coming?

51:09.443 --> 51:11.528
Heave-ho!

53:07.435 --> 53:09.521
The light. Light...

53:11.147 --> 53:12.941
Light the lamp, Mr. Baldwin.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.151
I'm trying.

53:21.616 --> 53:23.869
Mr. Joadson!

53:23.952 --> 53:25.912
Here.

53:30.250 --> 53:32.168
You all right?

53:36.131 --> 53:37.382
Yes.

54:17.714 --> 54:20.008
These papers,

54:20.091 --> 54:23.511
and I shall ask you to examine them,
are portions of a ship's manifest

54:23.595 --> 54:26.556
I retrieved from the <i>Amistad</i>
yesterday eve.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.724
At first glance, perhaps,

54:27.807 --> 54:31.144
they may appear to bolster
the prosecution's case.

54:32.103 --> 54:34.856
You see, they list cargo,

54:34.940 --> 54:37.275
cargo bearing the very Spanish names

54:37.359 --> 54:41.488
that Messrs. Ruiz and Montes
insist represent my clients,

54:42.530 --> 54:45.450
hand-scrawled in the margins.

54:45.659 --> 54:49.913
But, no, this is not the manifest
of the <i>Amistad</i> at all. Look.

54:51.831 --> 54:55.710
This is part of the cargo manifest
of a Portuguese vessel,

54:55.794 --> 54:59.714
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship, the <i>Tecora.</i>

54:59.798 --> 55:01.675
The <i>Tecora.</i>

55:04.219 --> 55:07.514
And I can bring you as many
witnesses as you wish, Mr. Holabird,

55:07.597 --> 55:09.140
- to corroborate this.
<i>- Tecora.</i>

55:09.224 --> 55:11.434
Their clients trade primarily
off the coast of West Africa,

55:11.518 --> 55:13.645
the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.

55:16.272 --> 55:18.316
I know what you're thinking.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.860
Sierra Leone is a protectorate
of the British Crown.

55:20.944 --> 55:23.113
Slavery is outlawed there.

55:23.196 --> 55:26.616
Its principal port, in fact,
has been rechristened "Freetown."

55:27.492 --> 55:30.328
How then,
can the Portuguese-flag-flying <i>Tecora</i>

55:30.412 --> 55:33.415
engage in the slave trades
in these waters?

55:33.498 --> 55:36.376
I'll tell you how, in a word.

55:39.254 --> 55:41.089
Illegally.

55:43.508 --> 55:46.219
Now, whatever these men say
from this point on clearly matters not

55:46.302 --> 55:49.014
because this proves them liars.

55:49.097 --> 55:51.391
My clients' journey
did not begin in Havana,

55:51.474 --> 55:54.561
as they claim and keep claiming
more and more emphatically.

55:54.644 --> 55:56.771
No, my clients' journey

56:00.483 --> 56:02.986
began much, much further away.

56:16.499 --> 56:19.335
I underestimated you, sir!

56:19.461 --> 56:21.171
I really did!

56:21.254 --> 56:23.214
Well, I should
take that as a compliment.

56:23.298 --> 56:25.008
You should, indeed, sir.
You should, indeed.

56:25.091 --> 56:26.384
You've done it, I think.

56:26.468 --> 56:30.055
I can't imagine there's no not reaching
a favorable conclusion...

56:30.638 --> 56:32.599
Hey! Hey!

56:34.225 --> 56:36.144
Am I bleeding?

56:37.979 --> 56:40.148
There's nothing there.

56:41.983 --> 56:44.569
What did I do to deserve this?

56:44.652 --> 56:46.905
You took the case, Mr. Baldwin.

56:47.864 --> 56:49.991
You took the case, sir.

56:50.533 --> 56:52.786
I should take that as a compliment.

56:53.787 --> 56:55.789
<i>"As you may perceive,</i>

56:56.372 --> 57:00.210
"I wish you to act promptly
before this matter of the Africans

57:00.293 --> 57:02.420
"becomes a weight
on our two countries."

57:02.504 --> 57:04.506
"Great countries."

57:04.589 --> 57:07.008
"Our great countries.

57:07.092 --> 57:10.637
"After all, the business
of great countries is to do business."

57:12.722 --> 57:15.934
"Slavery is our pillar of commerce
in the New World.

57:16.309 --> 57:20.480
"Without it, our goodwill
and excellent trade relations..."

57:20.563 --> 57:23.942
- "Should be imperiled."
- "Should be imperiled.

57:24.567 --> 57:27.278
<i>"Without it, we might
have been denied the glory</i>

57:27.362 --> 57:30.698
<i>"of aiding you in your virtuous
rebellion against the British.</i>

57:31.199 --> 57:35.537
<i>"As slave-owning nations,
we must together stand firm.</i>

57:36.788 --> 57:40.375
<i>"Speak the words of humaneness for
the masses of your citizens,</i>

57:40.458 --> 57:44.295
<i>"but hold tightly to the power
that protects them.</i>

57:44.379 --> 57:47.132
<i>"That power, of course, is their wealth.</i>

57:47.215 --> 57:50.260
<i>"The Africans must never go free.</i>

57:50.802 --> 57:53.304
"With sincerest admiration,

57:53.388 --> 57:56.933
"Isabella II, Queen of all of Spain."

57:57.225 --> 58:02.063
I am not about to bend
to the will of some pubescent queen.

58:02.147 --> 58:05.316
Forget about them. They're unimportant.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.777
- Prepubescent.
- What you need to concern yourself with

58:07.861 --> 58:10.989
is what this matter means here,
not an ocean away.

58:11.072 --> 58:13.074
I wish someone would
tell me what it means!

58:13.575 --> 58:16.411
Leder, you yourself
said it was meaningless.

58:16.494 --> 58:18.079
Well, not anymore.

58:21.374 --> 58:23.418
John Calhoun paid me a visit.

58:23.501 --> 58:24.836
Oh, God.

58:24.919 --> 58:28.965
To explain to me why this case
is of much greater import,

58:29.048 --> 58:31.843
much greater symbolism,
to use his word,

58:31.926 --> 58:33.469
to the South and the North.

58:34.554 --> 58:37.182
Now, if the Africans are executed,

58:37.265 --> 58:39.184
the abolitionists will
certainly make good use of it.

58:39.267 --> 58:41.644
And, yes, they will make some converts.

58:41.728 --> 58:45.607
If, on the other hand, they are freed,
if that happens,

58:45.690 --> 58:47.609
Calhoun assures me
the Southern states will

58:47.692 --> 58:51.154
so ally themselves against you,
that you can forget about re-election.

58:52.739 --> 58:54.199
Over this?

58:54.282 --> 58:55.617
It's worse than that.

58:55.700 --> 58:58.077
Worse? What could be worse than that?

58:58.161 --> 59:01.372
Calhoun believes, and I am not sure
I can entirely disagree with him,

59:01.456 --> 59:05.293
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war.

59:06.961 --> 59:08.171
This?

59:08.254 --> 59:09.964
Yes, Mr. President.

59:10.506 --> 59:13.051
But all is not lost.

59:13.134 --> 59:15.261
Yes, the jury appears
disposed towards freeing them.

59:15.345 --> 59:16.804
But juries can be dismissed.

59:19.724 --> 59:20.975
They can?

59:22.727 --> 59:25.897
But I believe we must go further
and remove the judge.

59:26.356 --> 59:28.858
<i>We can do that?</i>

59:28.942 --> 59:33.404
<i>He could be prevailed upon to recuse
himself for any number of reasons.</i>

59:33.863 --> 59:35.073
<i>And with that in mind,</i>

59:35.156 --> 59:38.409
<i>I've taken the liberty
of exploring possible replacements,</i>

59:38.493 --> 59:41.663
<i>and I've found one
I strongly believe to be better.</i>

59:43.456 --> 59:47.794
<i>He's young, which means he has
a career before him rather than behind,</i>

59:47.877 --> 59:50.046
<i>which means he has yet
to feel the hankering</i>

59:50.129 --> 59:53.299
<i>for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity.</i>

59:53.383 --> 59:59.180
<i>And he is monumentally insecure,
particularly about his Catholic heritage.</i>

59:59.806 --> 01:00:02.684
<i>- He's Catholic?
- His grandfather was Catholic,</i>

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:07.146
<i>which young Mr. Coglin
has striven all his days to keep quiet.</i>

01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:09.649
Mr. President, meet Judge Coglin.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:12.735
Judge Coglin,
we are so pleased to meet you.

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:14.529
Thank you so much for coming.

01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:38.553
I've been reading in the papers

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:43.391
the continuing saga of the <i>Amistad.</i>

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:45.476
Real papers.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:49.272
Real papers. Yes, sir.

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:54.777
Yes. Bad luck,
this last unfolding chapter.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:57.655
What to do now?

01:00:57.739 --> 01:01:00.908
Which is precisely why I came to
Massachusetts and imposed on you, sir.

01:01:01.409 --> 01:01:04.537
No imposition, really.

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.082
Yeah.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.004
How did that...

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:16.049
How did that young lawyer
take the news?

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:19.010
In stride, sir. In stride.

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:23.473
The thing is, sir, he did everything right.

01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:25.767
- He proved the case.
- Did he?

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.561
Yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.

01:01:30.396 --> 01:01:31.522
Good.

01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:34.525
Well, he'll just have to do it again, then,
won't he?

01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:37.278
But like most things, it should be
easier the second time around.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:42.950
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't matter
what he does now, sir.

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:46.537
Rumor has it our next judge
was handpicked by Van Buren himself.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:49.082
No!

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:55.129
Well, I'm embarrassed to admit
that I was under the misconception

01:01:55.213 --> 01:01:58.466
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:02.136
No more so than these, Mr. Joadson.

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:05.390
No more so than these.

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:08.601
So now you know.

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.686
Yes.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.313
- Sir?
- Yeah?

01:02:12.397 --> 01:02:15.566
Mr. President, if it was you
handling the case...

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.444
But it isn't me. And thank God for that.

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:24.325
But if it was, sir,

01:02:24.409 --> 01:02:26.494
what would you do?

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:40.550
Well, when I was an attorney
a long time ago, young man,

01:02:41.134 --> 01:02:45.513
I realized after much trial and error

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:47.390
that in a courtroom

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:52.186
whoever tells the best story wins.

01:02:53.896 --> 01:02:59.444
In unlawyer-like fashion, I give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge.

01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:05.867
I'm much obliged for your time, sir.

01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:11.414
What is their story, by the way?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.292
Sir?

01:03:15.877 --> 01:03:17.587
What is their story?

01:03:19.547 --> 01:03:22.258
Why, they're...

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:26.637
They're from West Africa.

01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:31.058
No. What is their story?

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.029
Mr. Joadson,
you're from where originally?

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:46.073
Why, Georgia, sir.

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:48.451
- Georgia.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:50.620
Does that pretty much
sum up what you are?

01:03:50.703 --> 01:03:53.831
A Georgian? Is that your story?

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:59.378
No. You're an ex-slave
who's devoted his life

01:03:59.462 --> 01:04:02.507
to the abolition of slavery,
and overcoming great obstacles

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:05.968
and hardships along the way,
I should imagine.

01:04:06.052 --> 01:04:09.263
That's your story, isn't it?

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:23.361
You and this young so-called lawyer
have proven you know what they are.

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:25.905
They're Africans. Congratulations.

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.784
What you don't know,
and, as far as I can tell,

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:33.496
haven't bothered in the least to discover
is who they are.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:39.126
Right?

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:54.475
Seven.

01:04:55.977 --> 01:04:57.645
Eight.

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:01.232
Number nine.

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:04.777
And 10.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.822
Now, how about you, Mr. Baldwin?

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:10.533
Would you like to count from one to 10?

01:05:10.616 --> 01:05:12.785
One to 10 in Mende.

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:15.913
One.

01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:17.748
Two.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:19.834
Three.

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.461
Four.

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:26.299
Right. Five.

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:47.903
Fresh fruit! Fresh fruit!
Straight from the Caribbean!

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:15.866
What's happened here?

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:17.868
I don't know.
One of them died last night.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:20.621
We tried to take
the body away to bury it.

01:07:20.705 --> 01:07:23.290
Well, what do they want?
They want to live with it?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.059
They want to bury him.

01:07:42.143 --> 01:07:45.062
They have to bury him
according to their Poro beliefs.

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:47.398
Otherwise, his soul
will haunt them forever.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:22.390
If I were you, if I ran this place,

01:08:22.475 --> 01:08:26.395
I'd set protocol aside just this once
and let them bury him.

01:08:30.566 --> 01:08:33.486
I was thinking the same thing.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.040
My name is Kai Nyagua -

01:09:29.041 --> 01:09:31.085
My name is Kai Nyagua -
and James Covey.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:35.421
I speak Mende and English -
his language.

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:40.636
You and he will talk to each other through me.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:44.430
The clothes?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.559
And the names.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:49.645
I was rescued off a slave
ship by the British Navy.

01:09:49.854 --> 01:09:52.314
I never went back.

01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:58.654
A problem has arisen.

01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:03.367
The judge we had, who believed,
I believe,

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:06.620
that you should be freed,
has been dismissed.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:11.375
A new judge has been called upon
to hear the case,

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.002
this time without a jury.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:26.390
How is that possible?
A chief cannot be replaced.

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:29.977
I can't explain it in any way
that you would understand, Cinque.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:34.064
Or me, for that matter.
Only that, well, it has happened.

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:44.658
I am not a great orator
or advisor, Cinque.

01:10:45.701 --> 01:10:48.412
I'm not a big man in my profession.

01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:52.166
I don't know that I alone can convince
this next judge to set you free.

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:56.295
I need your help.

01:10:58.672 --> 01:11:02.843
When we go to court,
I need you to speak.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:12.436
I'm not an advisor of any kind.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:15.022
I cannot speak for the others.

01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:17.441
Cinque, the others, they say you can.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:20.861
They say you're the big man here.

01:11:23.238 --> 01:11:24.698
I am not.

01:11:30.955 --> 01:11:33.040
What's this I hear about a lion?

01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:39.838
They say you alone, alone, Cinque,

01:11:39.922 --> 01:11:43.884
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen.

01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:45.886
Is it not true?

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.474
It had killed several people.

01:12:35.102 --> 01:12:37.021
Even hunters among us.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:40.607
Everyone, including me, was afraid.

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:47.364
I was lying down with my family
when out of nowhere it appeared.

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:51.493
As it came for me,

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:55.789
I picked up this big rock and I threw it.

01:13:00.044 --> 01:13:03.839
And by some miracle, you see, I hit it.

01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:10.220
He don't know how that killed it,
but it did.

01:13:15.476 --> 01:13:16.810
A rock.

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:22.107
A rock.

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:45.339
I received the gratitude
of everyone in the village.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:54.348
I was given respect.

01:13:57.226 --> 01:14:00.020
They treated me as if I was a prince.

01:14:04.233 --> 01:14:07.194
They gave me the fine country cloth.

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:20.207
All these things they gave me,
I took them all.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.881
But I knew I didn't deserve it.

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:36.306
For when I threw that rock at that beast

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:38.308
if I had missed him...

01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:39.643
He said he wouldn't be
sitting here today

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:42.271
trying to explain these things
to you or me or...

01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:43.730
He'd just be dead.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.988
Understand?

01:14:56.869 --> 01:14:58.787
You understand?

01:15:13.719 --> 01:15:18.223
I'm not a big man, just a lucky one.

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:32.654
I might agree with you, Cinque,
except you're forgetting something.

01:15:37.784 --> 01:15:39.703
The other lion.

01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:45.459
The <i>Amistad,</i> Cinque. The insurrection.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:48.587
That, too, was an accident?
I hardly think so.

01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:57.846
That wasn't bravery.

01:16:03.352 --> 01:16:05.854
Any man would do the same
to get back to his family.

01:16:07.314 --> 01:16:09.441
You yourself would do it.

01:16:20.369 --> 01:16:22.746
Someone said that might be yours.

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:31.213
<i>My wife gave it to me.</i>

01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:41.139
<i>To keep me safe.</i>

01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:47.688
Cinque, I need you to tell me
how you got here.

01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:23.473
I'll hit you in the head again if you talk.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.601
I'll share the profit of my harvest.
I'll give you all of it if you -

01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:52.210
Lomboko Slave Fortress

01:22:14.097 --> 01:22:18.059
This one's sick, don't give him any.

01:22:26.693 --> 01:22:28.028
Her.

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:30.030
Not her.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.115
Her.

01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:09.629
Havana, Cuba

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:33.171
Bernardo.

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:12.085
I wanted to kill them, too.

01:26:14.379 --> 01:26:18.341
For they convinced some of us
that they would take us back home.

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:27.183
Thank you, sir.

01:26:34.274 --> 01:26:36.067
Mr. Holabird.

01:26:41.739 --> 01:26:43.700
Quite a tale.

01:26:43.783 --> 01:26:46.202
Intrigue, abduction,

01:26:46.286 --> 01:26:49.414
courage in the face
of unspeakable suffering.

01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:53.167
And all true. All right.
Now tell me if this is true.

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.753
Certain tribes in Africa,
for hundreds of years,

01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.965
thousands, perhaps,
have owned slaves.

01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:04.929
Translate.

01:27:12.437 --> 01:27:13.605
Yes.

01:27:13.688 --> 01:27:16.608
And under what circumstances
might one become a slave,

01:27:16.691 --> 01:27:19.819
say, among the Mende,
of which you claim to belong?

01:27:21.654 --> 01:27:23.573
Translate.

01:27:32.165 --> 01:27:34.584
Wars, debts.

01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:36.127
I see.

01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:38.588
And how many men
are indebted to you?

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:40.214
- I don't think you do see.
- Excuse me?

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.925
- Your Honor, Mr. Holabird...
- It's different.

01:27:42.008 --> 01:27:43.593
...is trying to intimidate my colleague.

01:27:43.676 --> 01:27:46.721
The Mende word for "slave"
is closer in meaning to "worker."

01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:49.265
Do these workers
own the land they work on?

01:27:49.349 --> 01:27:51.267
Do they receive wages?

01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:54.938
Are these workers free to
not work for you, if they so choose?

01:27:55.021 --> 01:27:56.940
Your Honor,
he's questioning the translator.

01:27:57.023 --> 01:27:59.359
No, the translator is answering
for the witness, Your Honor.

01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:02.111
- The witness isn't being given a chance.
- Mr. Baldwin!

01:28:02.195 --> 01:28:04.572
Fine, fine, Mr. Baldwin!

01:28:05.198 --> 01:28:07.951
Slavery, indentured servitude.

01:28:08.034 --> 01:28:10.203
Whatever they want to call it,
I don't mind.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.080
The concept is the same.

01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:15.166
Now, he is familiar with the concept.

01:28:16.209 --> 01:28:19.128
After all, when you come down to it,
it's all about money, isn't it?

01:28:19.212 --> 01:28:22.757
Slaves, production, money.
I mean, that's the idea of it.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.802
Whether it's here or there. I'm confused.

01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:33.267
Do your people
routinely slaughter their slaves

01:28:33.393 --> 01:28:36.646
in the manner that you just
so vividly described to us?

01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:43.736
Of course they don't.
What would be the point of that?

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.323
I mean, killing your own slaves is rather
like burning down your own house

01:28:47.407 --> 01:28:49.492
or hut, isn't it?

01:28:51.995 --> 01:28:54.330
How do you explain that paradox?

01:29:00.586 --> 01:29:02.672
I don't understand what you mean.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:06.509
Sure you do. As does everyone here.

01:29:06.592 --> 01:29:09.345
The behavior you attribute
to your tormentors,

01:29:09.429 --> 01:29:11.347
your victims, to be more precise,

01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:14.851
and therefore every other
aspect of your testimony,

01:29:14.934 --> 01:29:18.104
makes no sense.

01:29:19.981 --> 01:29:22.025
Not even to you.

01:29:22.108 --> 01:29:23.526
But thank you for it.

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:26.446
Like all good works of fiction,
it was entertaining.

01:29:26.946 --> 01:29:28.781
Nothing more.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.294
Captain Fitzgerald, please explain to us

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:44.213
your primary duties
in Her Majesty's navy.

01:29:44.297 --> 01:29:47.216
To patrol the Ivory Coast for slave ships.

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.218
Because?

01:29:49.302 --> 01:29:52.764
Because slavery is banned
in British law, sir.

01:29:53.264 --> 01:29:56.225
Yet the abduction of free men from
the British protectorate of Sierra Leone

01:29:56.309 --> 01:29:58.686
and their illegal transportation
to the New World,

01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:01.022
as described by Cinque,
is not unheard of, is it?

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:04.192
Not even unusual, regrettably.

01:30:04.484 --> 01:30:09.614
Well, what, if anything, in his account
of his ordeal do you find believable?

01:30:11.157 --> 01:30:15.161
His description of the slave fortress,
for one thing.

01:30:15.953 --> 01:30:17.580
There is such a place.

01:30:17.872 --> 01:30:19.499
You've seen it?

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.585
No, sir. We've not managed to locate it,

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:25.671
but there is overwhelming evidence
that it is real.

01:30:25.797 --> 01:30:28.091
What evidence, exactly? Rumor?

01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:31.928
Reports.

01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:36.474
By "reports" you mean of the variety
Cinque shared with us today?

01:30:37.475 --> 01:30:41.062
Its existence, sir, has been reported.

01:30:41.395 --> 01:30:43.272
Cinque describes
the cold-blooded murder

01:30:43.356 --> 01:30:45.817
of a significant portion of the people
on board the <i>Tecora.</i>

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.362
Mr. Holabird sees this as a paradox.
Do you, sir?

01:30:50.321 --> 01:30:55.284
Often when slavers are intercepted,
or believe they may be,

01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:57.662
they simply throw all
their prisoners overboard

01:30:57.745 --> 01:31:01.040
and thereby rid themselves
of the evidence of their crime.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:04.252
Drown hundreds of people?

01:31:04.335 --> 01:31:05.878
Yes.

01:31:06.462 --> 01:31:10.550
It hardly seems a lucrative business
to me, this slave-trading.

01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:12.510
Going to all that trouble
rounding everybody up

01:31:12.593 --> 01:31:14.011
only to throw them overboard.

01:31:14.345 --> 01:31:16.514
No, it's very lucrative.

01:31:17.306 --> 01:31:20.893
If only we could corroborate
Cinque's story somehow

01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:25.565
with evidence of some kind.

01:31:25.648 --> 01:31:27.692
The inventory.

01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:35.324
This? From the <i>Tecora?</i>

01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:39.245
If you look,
there's a notation made on May 10

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:43.374
correcting the number of slaves on
board, reducing their number by 50.

01:31:43.457 --> 01:31:45.710
What does that mean?

01:31:45.793 --> 01:31:48.671
Well, if you look at it
in conjunction with Cinque's testimony,

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:51.382
I would say that it means this.

01:31:51.465 --> 01:31:53.968
The <i>Tecora</i> crew,
having greatly underestimated

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:57.221
the amount of provisions
required for their journey,

01:31:57.305 --> 01:32:00.600
solved the problem
by throwing 50 people overboard.

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:51.567
I'm looking at the same
inventory, Captain,

01:32:51.651 --> 01:32:54.737
and I'm sorry, I don't see where it says,

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.907
"This morning,
we threw 50 slaves overboard."

01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:59.825
On May 10 or any other day.

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:02.328
As of course you would not.

01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:18.844
I do see that the cargo weight changed.

01:33:18.928 --> 01:33:22.306
They reduced the poundage, I see,
but that is all.

01:33:38.406 --> 01:33:40.992
It's simple, ghastly arithmetic.

01:33:42.076 --> 01:33:44.912
Well, for you, perhaps.

01:33:44.996 --> 01:33:48.416
I may need a quill and parchment
and a better imagination.

01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:54.422
And what poundage do you imagine
the entry may refer to, sir?

01:33:54.547 --> 01:33:56.507
A mast and sails, perhaps?

01:33:57.174 --> 01:34:00.886
Give us, us free.

01:34:05.141 --> 01:34:09.312
Give us free.

01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:14.900
Give us, us free.

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:23.284
Give us free.

01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:26.746
Your Honor,
please instruct the defendant

01:34:26.829 --> 01:34:29.498
that he cannot disrupt
these proceedings with such outbursts.

01:34:29.582 --> 01:34:32.960
Give us, us free!

01:34:33.252 --> 01:34:36.172
If we are to have any semblance
of order in this court, Your Honor...

01:34:36.255 --> 01:34:40.176
- Give us, us free! Give us, us free!
- He cannot keep crying out...

01:34:40.259 --> 01:34:43.095
Cannot keep crying out, "Give us free,"

01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:45.181
- or anything else...
- Give us, us free!

01:34:45.264 --> 01:34:47.850
...while I am trying
to question this witness!

01:34:47.933 --> 01:34:50.269
Give us, us free!

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.191
Give us, us free!

01:35:55.751 --> 01:36:00.673
You don't have to pretend to be interested in that.

01:36:01.173 --> 01:36:04.385
Nobody's watching but me.

01:36:04.635 --> 01:36:09.515
I'm not pretending.
I'm beginning to understand it.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:28.868
Their people have suffered more than ours...
Their lives were full of suffering.

01:36:31.537 --> 01:36:37.168
Then he was born and everything changed.

01:36:45.259 --> 01:36:46.594
Who is he?

01:36:46.886 --> 01:36:53.559
I don't know, but everywhere he goes,
he is followed by the sun.

01:37:00.483 --> 01:37:04.236
Here he is healing people with his hands.

01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:12.620
Protecting them...

01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:20.586
Being given children...

01:37:29.261 --> 01:37:31.096
What's this?

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.808
He could also walk across the sea.

01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:43.484
But then something happened...

01:37:45.194 --> 01:37:49.365
He was captured. Accused of some crime.

01:37:49.907 --> 01:37:54.203
Here he is with his hands tied.

01:37:57.122 --> 01:37:58.958
He must have done something.

01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:02.127
Why? What did we do?

01:38:02.628 --> 01:38:08.926
Whatever it was, it was serious enough
to kill him for it.

01:38:09.927 --> 01:38:13.472
Do you want to see how they killed him?

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.482
This is just a story, Yamba.

01:38:23.816 --> 01:38:28.821
But look. That's not the end of it.

01:38:31.073 --> 01:38:35.619
His people took his body down
from this... thing... this...

01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:52.261
They took him into a cave.
They wrapped him in a cloth, like we do.

01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:59.018
They thought he was dead, but he appeared
before his people again... and spoke to them.

01:39:01.604 --> 01:39:08.402
Then, finally, he rose into the sky.

01:39:19.955 --> 01:39:25.461
This is where the soul goes when you die here.

01:39:28.297 --> 01:39:32.926
This is where we're going when they kill us.

01:39:37.473 --> 01:39:40.768
It doesn't look so bad.

01:40:23.644 --> 01:40:25.395
Buakei...

01:40:25.396 --> 01:40:27.022
Buakei... Hold your head up.

01:41:00.848 --> 01:41:02.599
All rise.

01:42:03.243 --> 01:42:06.872
After careful review
and thorough reflection,

01:42:08.749 --> 01:42:13.045
I find it impossible to deny
the power of the government's position.

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:19.968
There is no doubt in my mind
that District Attorney Holabird,

01:42:20.886 --> 01:42:24.640
Her Catholic Majesty, Isabella of Spain,

01:42:24.723 --> 01:42:27.810
and her trusted minister,
<i>Señor</i> Calderon,

01:42:27.893 --> 01:42:30.813
have all proceeded with the utmost faith

01:42:31.897 --> 01:42:34.608
in the soundness of their case.

01:42:37.152 --> 01:42:42.074
I also believe
that <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes

01:42:42.157 --> 01:42:45.702
may have misrepresented

01:42:45.786 --> 01:42:48.747
the origin of the prisoners.

01:42:50.123 --> 01:42:53.961
An issue which weighs crucially
upon their fate,

01:42:54.044 --> 01:42:56.630
and that of the Spaniards as well.

01:43:02.636 --> 01:43:05.722
Were they born in Africa?

01:43:13.397 --> 01:43:15.816
But since the answer
to that fundamental question

01:43:15.899 --> 01:43:18.235
shall so heavily govern every
determination of this court,

01:43:18.318 --> 01:43:19.987
I ask it again.

01:43:22.781 --> 01:43:25.450
Were they born in Africa?

01:43:39.506 --> 01:43:41.466
I believe they were.

01:43:47.973 --> 01:43:53.395
As such, Her Catholic Majesty's
claims of ownership have no merit.

01:43:55.564 --> 01:43:57.482
Neither, of course, do those for salvage

01:43:57.566 --> 01:43:59.860
made by Lieutenants Meade
and Gedney.

01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:01.653
This is outrageous!

01:44:01.987 --> 01:44:07.409
I hereby order the immediate arrest and
detention of <i>Señors</i> Ruiz and Montes

01:44:10.704 --> 01:44:14.416
by federal marshals

01:44:14.499 --> 01:44:17.878
on the charge of slave-trading!

01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:19.922
Yes!

01:44:23.467 --> 01:44:25.677
The release of the Africans

01:44:25.844 --> 01:44:28.847
and their conveyance,
by this government

01:44:28.931 --> 01:44:31.433
at her earliest convenience
and expense,

01:44:31.516 --> 01:44:34.186
back to their homes in Africa!

01:44:34.269 --> 01:44:35.354
Yes!

01:44:44.863 --> 01:44:48.575
We've done it, Joadson!
We've done it! Yes!

01:44:48.659 --> 01:44:50.994
- Covey, tell them! Tell them now!
- I think they know.

01:44:58.251 --> 01:44:59.878
Look at 'em.

01:45:55.976 --> 01:45:58.645
What's most bewildering to Her Majesty

01:45:58.729 --> 01:46:03.191
is this arrogant independence
of the American courts.

01:46:03.275 --> 01:46:07.154
After all, if you cannot rule the courts,
you cannot rule.

01:46:07.237 --> 01:46:09.823
<i>Señor</i> Calderon,
as any true American will tell you,

01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:13.368
it's the independence of our courts
that keeps us free.

01:46:22.252 --> 01:46:25.047
John, glad you're here.

01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.716
- Mr. Forsyth.
- The President...

01:46:27.799 --> 01:46:30.761
Mr. President? Senator Calhoun is here.

01:46:30.844 --> 01:46:32.637
John!

01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:36.433
I was afraid you weren't
going to be able to join us.

01:46:36.516 --> 01:46:38.477
You may put that fear to rest,
Mr. President.

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.395
Thank you. Please.

01:46:40.479 --> 01:46:43.815
I'd like you to meet <i>Señor</i> Calderon,
ambassador from Spain.

01:46:49.488 --> 01:46:51.031
I thought you said he wasn't coming.

01:46:51.114 --> 01:46:53.033
He said he wasn't.

01:46:53.992 --> 01:46:56.828
You see, <i>Señor</i> Calderon,

01:46:56.912 --> 01:47:00.749
there's a growing number of people
in this part of the country

01:47:00.832 --> 01:47:03.960
that regard us in the South

01:47:04.044 --> 01:47:07.714
as not only geographically
beneath them.

01:47:09.341 --> 01:47:10.759
They ignore the fact

01:47:10.842 --> 01:47:15.222
that slavery is so interwoven
into the fabric of this society,

01:47:15.305 --> 01:47:19.726
that to destroy it would be
to destroy us as a people.

01:47:21.186 --> 01:47:24.523
It's immoral. That's all they know.

01:47:25.148 --> 01:47:27.859
Therefore, so are we.

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.988
Immoral and inferior.

01:47:34.407 --> 01:47:37.577
We are inferior in one area.

01:47:38.245 --> 01:47:42.124
We're not as proficient in the art of gain.

01:47:42.207 --> 01:47:46.169
We're not as wealthy
as our northern neighbors.

01:47:46.253 --> 01:47:49.381
We're still struggling.

01:47:49.464 --> 01:47:52.175
Take away our life's blood now...

01:47:54.553 --> 01:47:58.974
Well, we all know what happens then,

01:47:59.057 --> 01:48:01.059
North and South.

01:48:02.644 --> 01:48:06.690
They become the masters,
and we the slaves.

01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:11.069
But not without a fight.

01:48:14.406 --> 01:48:16.992
Senator Calhoun is being modest.

01:48:17.075 --> 01:48:20.954
He's not inferior in another area.
The art of exaggeration.

01:48:25.584 --> 01:48:29.171
Ask yourself, <i>Señor</i> Calderon,

01:48:29.254 --> 01:48:34.217
what court wants to be responsible for
the spark that ignites the firestorm?

01:48:35.594 --> 01:48:39.931
What President wants to be in office

01:48:40.015 --> 01:48:42.684
when it comes crashing
down around him?

01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:48.064
Certainly no court before this one.

01:48:49.941 --> 01:48:53.111
Certainly no President before this one.

01:48:55.238 --> 01:48:56.448
So,

01:48:57.032 --> 01:48:59.784
judge us not too harshly, sir,

01:49:00.952 --> 01:49:04.873
and bid Her Majesty like,

01:49:04.956 --> 01:49:09.711
because the real determination our
courts and our President must make

01:49:09.794 --> 01:49:13.215
is not whether
this ragtag group of Africans

01:49:13.298 --> 01:49:16.134
raised swords against their enemy,

01:49:16.218 --> 01:49:19.554
but rather, must we?

01:49:47.832 --> 01:49:50.168
Come along, Mr. Joadson.

01:49:50.835 --> 01:49:53.171
This news...

01:49:53.672 --> 01:49:57.384
Well, of course, it's bad news,
but the truth is

01:49:57.467 --> 01:50:01.888
they may be more valuable
to our struggle in death than in life.

01:50:06.518 --> 01:50:09.437
Martyrdom, Mr. Joadson.

01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:14.317
From the dawn of Christianity, we have
seen no stronger power for change.

01:50:16.152 --> 01:50:17.779
Well, you know it's true.

01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.035
What is true, Mr. Tappan,

01:50:24.119 --> 01:50:28.039
and believe me when I tell you
I've seen this,

01:50:28.123 --> 01:50:30.667
is that there are some men
whose hatred of slavery

01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:34.587
is stronger than anything

01:50:34.671 --> 01:50:37.299
except for the slave himself.

01:50:40.385 --> 01:50:44.597
If you wish to inspire such hatred
in a man, Mr. Joadson,

01:50:44.681 --> 01:50:47.892
speak to him in that fashion
and it may come true.

01:51:19.299 --> 01:51:24.346
Our President, our big, big man,

01:51:24.429 --> 01:51:27.015
has appealed the decision
to our Supreme Court.

01:51:33.855 --> 01:51:35.815
What does that mean?

01:51:38.902 --> 01:51:41.696
We have to try the case again.

01:51:49.037 --> 01:51:51.748
Now, I know it's hard
to understand, Cinque.

01:51:51.831 --> 01:51:53.625
I don't understand, for that matter.

01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:58.421
You said there would be a judgment,

01:51:58.505 --> 01:52:00.507
and if we won the judgment
we would go free!

01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:03.968
No, no. What I said is that
we won it at the state level.

01:52:04.052 --> 01:52:06.596
- No, no, no.
- That's what you said!

01:52:06.679 --> 01:52:10.683
What I said, that if we won it
at the state level, we then go on.

01:52:11.601 --> 01:52:13.019
That's what you said!

01:52:13.228 --> 01:52:16.564
- That's what you said.
- All right, yeah. Yes, I said it!

01:52:16.648 --> 01:52:20.777
I said it, but I shouldn't have.
What I should've said...

01:52:21.778 --> 01:52:23.446
- I can't translate that.
- You can't translate what?

01:52:23.530 --> 01:52:24.989
I can't translate "should."

01:52:25.073 --> 01:52:26.616
You saying
there's no word in Mende for "should"?

01:52:26.699 --> 01:52:29.494
No. Either you do something,
or you don't do it.

01:52:29.577 --> 01:52:32.580
What I meant to say...
What I meant to say?

01:52:32.664 --> 01:52:35.166
Not in the way you mean it.

01:52:38.878 --> 01:52:40.046
Try and understand me.

01:52:40.130 --> 01:52:43.258
"Meant" is the same as "should."
You're misunderstanding the language.

01:52:43.341 --> 01:52:45.260
Cinque, Cinque. Cinque!

01:52:45.343 --> 01:52:48.096
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Understand what I'm saying.

01:52:48.179 --> 01:52:51.933
What I said to you
before the judgment...

01:52:52.183 --> 01:52:55.937
What I said to you before the judgment
is almost how it works here.

01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:58.064
Almost.

01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:03.069
Almost.

01:53:03.194 --> 01:53:05.280
Yes, Cinque. But not always.

01:53:07.949 --> 01:53:11.161
Yes. And that's what's happened.

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:24.549
What kind of place is this?

01:53:29.679 --> 01:53:33.600
Where you almost mean what you say?
Where laws almost work?

01:53:33.725 --> 01:53:37.353
How can you live like that?

01:54:50.468 --> 01:54:53.721
<i>"To His Excellency,

- Any word from Mr. Adams?
- What did Cinque say?

01:56:45.333 --> 01:56:47.794
He won't talk to you.

01:56:47.877 --> 01:56:50.254
He won't talk to me?

01:56:50.338 --> 01:56:51.547
No.

01:56:56.302 --> 01:56:58.221
<i>How's your English coming?</i>

01:56:58.304 --> 01:57:00.765
<i>No better than my Mende, I suppose.</i>

01:57:02.308 --> 01:57:04.394
You know, Cinque,
I realize this isn't something

01:57:04.477 --> 01:57:06.688
you necessarily want to think about,

01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:10.733
but has it occurred to you
that I'm all you've got?

01:57:11.609 --> 01:57:13.027
Because as it happens,

01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:16.197
since my practice has completely
deteriorated in the past months,

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.324
you're all I've got.

01:57:28.126 --> 01:57:30.795
See, this is me. You see?

01:57:31.462 --> 01:57:33.297
You see? You see how this works?

01:57:33.673 --> 01:57:39.220
And this here, Cinque, is for me.

01:57:41.639 --> 01:57:42.807
More death threats.

01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:47.311
Some of them signed.
By my own clients, no less.

01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:51.023
I should say former clients, shouldn't I?

01:57:57.488 --> 01:58:01.993
There is one more consequence
to having no clientele to speak of.

01:58:04.746 --> 01:58:06.080
I am now free

01:58:06.456 --> 01:58:10.835
to sit here as long as it takes
for you to acknowledge me.

01:58:10.918 --> 01:58:14.839
Yes, you understood that word,
didn't you? "Free."

01:58:16.257 --> 01:58:18.176
All right.

01:58:22.013 --> 01:58:24.265
Then we'll just sit.

01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:29.020
Caesar.

01:58:31.564 --> 01:58:34.692
Cicero's appeal was to Julius Caesar,
not Claudius.

01:58:34.776 --> 01:58:38.029
Claudius would not be born
for another hundred years.

01:58:38.112 --> 01:58:40.740
You were right, there was one of them.

01:58:42.074 --> 01:58:43.451
Is that him?

01:58:43.534 --> 01:58:45.036
Yes, Mr. President.

01:58:46.579 --> 01:58:48.206
Please unlock this door.

01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:51.125
<i>Adams has flirted with
the abolitionists for 15 years,</i>

01:58:51.209 --> 01:58:52.919
but has yet to take one
home from the dance.

01:58:53.002 --> 01:58:54.962
How old is he anyway?

01:58:55.046 --> 01:58:58.132
Old enough to know he's too old
to take anyone home from the dance.

01:58:58.216 --> 01:59:00.718
I hear he sleeps through three-quarters
of the sessions on the Hill.

01:59:00.802 --> 01:59:03.971
Let's see. President, slumbering
congressman from Massachusetts,

01:59:04.055 --> 01:59:08.226
jail-house lawyer, one waits
with great anticipation for what's next.

01:59:08.976 --> 01:59:11.604
- Well, what must that be like?
- What?

01:59:11.687 --> 01:59:15.066
Knowing all your life,
whatever your accomplishments,

01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:17.985
you'll only be remembered
as the son of a great father.

01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:20.488
The only thing John Quincy Adams
will be remembered for

01:59:20.571 --> 01:59:22.031
is his middle name.

01:59:25.243 --> 01:59:29.288
I wonder, is there anything
as pathetic as an ex-President?

01:59:35.628 --> 01:59:38.172
I was talking about John...

02:00:06.576 --> 02:00:09.036
- Sir.
- Yes?

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.957
Cinque has asked me to ask you

02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.210
whether you have thought about
the question of jurisdiction.

02:00:16.294 --> 02:00:17.420
What?

02:00:17.503 --> 02:00:21.966
That since they took over the ship
far out to sea,

02:00:23.050 --> 02:00:26.262
and since neither Spain
nor America owns the sea,

02:00:26.345 --> 02:00:28.973
how is it that the treaty applies?

02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:34.979
Tell him the treaty recognizes
no jurisdictional limitations.

02:00:37.023 --> 02:00:40.151
- Well?
- He will ask me why.

02:00:40.276 --> 02:00:43.029
Because I said so.

02:00:55.166 --> 02:00:57.084
Excuse me, sir.

02:00:57.168 --> 02:00:58.753
Yes?

02:00:58.836 --> 02:01:01.047
Cinque would like to know

02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:04.342
that if he is the legal property
of Ruiz and Montes,

02:01:04.425 --> 02:01:08.804
then how does the treaty apply,
since it is between America and Spain?

02:01:08.888 --> 02:01:11.766
Or their citizens.

02:01:11.849 --> 02:01:16.646
"Or their citizens" is included
in the language, if he must know.

02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:18.856
Thank you, sir.

02:01:22.276 --> 02:01:24.987
It's a good point, though.

02:01:32.286 --> 02:01:34.956
Does Great Britain have
any treaties with West Africa

02:01:35.039 --> 02:01:37.249
which may override those
between Spain and America?

02:01:37.333 --> 02:01:38.626
No.

02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:40.586
Does Great Britain have
any treaties with America

02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:42.546
which might override
those between Spain and...

02:01:42.630 --> 02:01:44.090
No.

02:01:44.173 --> 02:01:46.258
Does the American government have
any treaties with West Africa?

02:01:46.342 --> 02:01:47.301
No.

02:01:47.385 --> 02:01:48.970
Does Spain have
any treaties with West Africa?

02:01:49.053 --> 02:01:50.304
No!

02:01:50.388 --> 02:01:52.807
Does the Commonwealth of Connecticut
have any treaties with West Africa?

02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:56.560
No, no, no, no! Now stop this!

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.860
Unshackle him.

02:02:04.944 --> 02:02:07.363
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm under strict orders to ensure the...

02:02:07.446 --> 02:02:09.907
Unshackle him, please.

02:02:12.576 --> 02:02:15.246
Yes, Mr. President.

02:02:23.337 --> 02:02:28.342
This is a <i>Phalaenopsis,</i> moth orchid,
I brought over from China.

02:02:29.719 --> 02:02:32.847
And this is a primrose
from an English garden.

02:02:34.598 --> 02:02:39.562
And this spear lily,
from the south of France.

02:02:42.732 --> 02:02:45.526
This is my rose, Blush Noisette.

02:02:45.609 --> 02:02:49.238
This came all the way
from Washington DC,

02:02:49.321 --> 02:02:52.074
but don't tell anyone.

02:03:05.379 --> 02:03:07.423
Go on, go on.

02:03:22.646 --> 02:03:26.776
African violet. I can't tell you
how difficult that was to come by.

02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:45.002
Now, you understand
you're going to the Supreme Court.

02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:48.214
Do you know why?

02:03:56.013 --> 02:03:58.182
It is the place where they finally kill us.

02:03:58.724 --> 02:04:01.727
No. Well, yes, that may be true, too.

02:04:03.604 --> 02:04:05.481
That's not what I meant.

02:04:05.564 --> 02:04:08.734
No, there is another reason
and a more important reason.

02:04:08.818 --> 02:04:13.739
Although, I'll admit that
perhaps more so to us than you.

02:04:14.782 --> 02:04:17.868
All right, don't... Yeah.

02:04:18.077 --> 02:04:20.079
Cinque.

02:04:22.123 --> 02:04:27.044
Do you know who I am?
Has anyone told you about me?

02:04:31.882 --> 02:04:33.050
Yes.

02:04:33.217 --> 02:04:34.635
What have they told you?

02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:40.891
That you are a chief.

02:04:41.058 --> 02:04:43.060
I was a chief, yes.

02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:53.237
A chief cannot become anything
less than a chief, even in death.

02:04:55.197 --> 02:04:58.784
How I wish such were true here, Cinque.

02:04:58.868 --> 02:05:00.953
You've no idea.

02:05:02.663 --> 02:05:06.584
One tries to govern wisely,
strongly, but...

02:05:06.667 --> 02:05:10.421
One tries to govern in a way that
betters the lives of one's villagers.

02:05:13.090 --> 02:05:16.260
One tries to kill the lion.

02:05:19.513 --> 02:05:24.435
Unfortunately, one isn't always
wise enough or strong enough.

02:05:27.271 --> 02:05:29.231
Time passes

02:05:30.941 --> 02:05:33.068
and the moment is gone.

02:05:35.905 --> 02:05:39.575
Now, listen, Cinque. Listen.

02:05:39.658 --> 02:05:44.747
We're about to bring your case

02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:47.583
before the highest court in our land.

02:05:47.666 --> 02:05:50.544
We're about to do battle with a lion

02:05:50.628 --> 02:05:54.131
that is threatening
to rip our country in two.

02:05:56.091 --> 02:06:00.679
And all we have on our side is a rock.

02:06:03.724 --> 02:06:07.102
Of course, you didn't ask
to be at the center

02:06:07.645 --> 02:06:09.605
of this historic conflagration
any more than I did,

02:06:09.688 --> 02:06:11.941
but we find ourselves here nonetheless

02:06:12.024 --> 02:06:15.819
by some mysterious mix
of circumstances

02:06:15.903 --> 02:06:18.822
and all the world watching.

02:06:18.906 --> 02:06:22.076
So, what are we to do?

02:06:26.497 --> 02:06:32.503
Is he going to help? He has far
many more questions than answers.

02:06:33.087 --> 02:06:36.715
- What'd he just say?
- Sorry. I didn't catch it.

02:06:36.799 --> 02:06:41.303
Cinque, look. I'm being honest with you.

02:06:41.387 --> 02:06:44.181
Anything less would be disrespectful.

02:06:46.141 --> 02:06:49.770
I'm telling you, I'm preparing you,

02:06:49.853 --> 02:06:53.649
I suppose I'm explaining to you

02:06:53.732 --> 02:06:57.027
that the test ahead of us is
an exceptionally difficult one.

02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:04.952
We won't be going in there alone.

02:07:05.411 --> 02:07:07.705
Alone? Indeed not. No.
We have right at our side.

02:07:07.788 --> 02:07:09.957
We have righteousness at our side.

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.251
We have Mr. Baldwin over there.

02:07:19.717 --> 02:07:22.303
I meant my ancestors.

02:07:26.724 --> 02:07:28.392
I will call into the past,

02:07:30.561 --> 02:07:32.563
far back to the beginning of time,

02:07:33.731 --> 02:07:36.191
and beg them to come and help me

02:07:38.110 --> 02:07:39.528
at the judgment.

02:07:40.946 --> 02:07:44.074
I will reach back and draw them into me.

02:07:46.410 --> 02:07:48.162
And they must come,

02:07:49.371 --> 02:07:53.667
for at this moment, I am the
whole reason they have existed at all.

02:08:31.038 --> 02:08:32.247
Thank you.

02:08:36.251 --> 02:08:38.504
Your Honors,

02:08:40.631 --> 02:08:42.591
I derive much consolation

02:08:42.674 --> 02:08:46.970
from the fact that my colleague,
Mr. Baldwin here,

02:08:48.931 --> 02:08:51.934
has argued the case

02:08:52.017 --> 02:08:55.687
in so able and so complete a manner

02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.652
as to leave me scarcely anything to say.

02:09:02.694 --> 02:09:04.738
However,

02:09:06.615 --> 02:09:08.951
why are we here?

02:09:10.202 --> 02:09:13.997
How is it that a simple,
plain property issue

02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:17.751
should now find itself so ennobled
as to be argued before

02:09:17.835 --> 02:09:20.921
the Supreme Court of
the United States of America?

02:09:21.004 --> 02:09:23.882
I mean, do we fear the lower courts,
which found for us easily,

02:09:23.966 --> 02:09:25.592
somehow missed the truth? Is that it?

02:09:25.676 --> 02:09:30.514
Or is it, rather, our great
and consuming fear of civil war

02:09:30.597 --> 02:09:32.683
that has allowed us to heap symbolism

02:09:32.766 --> 02:09:35.436
upon a simple case
that never asked for it?

02:09:35.519 --> 02:09:38.480
And now would have us disregard truth

02:09:38.564 --> 02:09:42.192
even as it stands before us,
tall and proud as a mountain.

02:09:43.610 --> 02:09:45.863
The truth,

02:09:45.946 --> 02:09:51.368
in truth, has been driven
from this case like a slave,

02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:55.789
flogged from court to court,
wretched and destitute.

02:09:56.999 --> 02:10:01.211
And not by any great legal acumen

02:10:01.295 --> 02:10:04.131
on the part of the opposition,
I might add.

02:10:05.716 --> 02:10:09.970
But through the long,
powerful arm of the executive office.

02:10:11.221 --> 02:10:13.891
Yea, this is no mere property case.
Gentlemen, I put it to you thus.

02:10:13.974 --> 02:10:17.478
This is the most important case
ever to come before this court.

02:10:17.561 --> 02:10:21.565
Because what it in fact concerns

02:10:23.066 --> 02:10:25.569
is the very nature of man.

02:10:29.281 --> 02:10:31.074
These are...

02:10:35.787 --> 02:10:37.581
These are transcriptions of letters

02:10:37.664 --> 02:10:43.003
written between our
Secretary of State, John Forsyth,

02:10:43.086 --> 02:10:45.923
and the Queen of Spain, Isabella II.

02:10:47.591 --> 02:10:50.511
Now, I ask that you

02:10:50.594 --> 02:10:53.931
accept their perusal
as part of your deliberations.

02:10:54.431 --> 02:10:55.724
Thank you, sir.

02:10:57.893 --> 02:11:00.479
I would not touch on them now
except to notice

02:11:00.562 --> 02:11:03.815
a curious phrase
which is much repeated.

02:11:05.275 --> 02:11:09.780
The Queen again and again
refers to our "incompetent courts."

02:11:11.156 --> 02:11:15.118
Now what, I wonder,
would be more to her liking?

02:11:16.453 --> 02:11:19.665
A court that finds against the Africans?

02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:22.251
Well, I think not.

02:11:23.794 --> 02:11:27.130
And here is the fine point of it.

02:11:27.214 --> 02:11:31.718
What Her Majesty wants is a court
that behaves just like her courts,

02:11:31.802 --> 02:11:35.556
the courts
this 11-year-old child plays with

02:11:35.639 --> 02:11:38.725
in her magical kingdom called Spain.

02:11:38.809 --> 02:11:40.811
A court that will do what it is told.

02:11:40.894 --> 02:11:44.565
A court that can be toyed with
like a doll.

02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:50.362
A court, as it happens,
of which our own President,

02:11:51.989 --> 02:11:54.408
Martin Van Buren, would be most proud.

02:11:54.491 --> 02:11:55.784
Thank you.

02:11:56.785 --> 02:12:00.330
This is a publication
of the office of the President.

02:12:00.414 --> 02:12:05.335
It's called <i>The Executive Review,</i>
and I'm sure you all read it.

02:12:06.253 --> 02:12:09.881
At least I'm sure
the President hopes you all read it.

02:12:10.007 --> 02:12:14.886
This is a recent issue,
and there's an article in here

02:12:14.970 --> 02:12:19.391
written by
"a keen mind of the South," who...

02:12:20.267 --> 02:12:23.812
My former Vice President,
John Calhoun, perhaps.

02:12:23.895 --> 02:12:25.397
Could it be?

02:12:26.064 --> 02:12:28.984
Who asserts that "there has never
existed a civilized society

02:12:29.067 --> 02:12:34.156
"in which one segment did not
thrive upon the labor of another.

02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:37.159
"As far back as one chooses to look,

02:12:37.242 --> 02:12:40.162
"to ancient times, to biblical times,

02:12:40.245 --> 02:12:42.706
"history bears this out.

02:12:43.290 --> 02:12:47.044
"In Eden, where only two were created,

02:12:47.127 --> 02:12:51.465
"even there, one was pronounced
subordinate to the other.

02:12:52.633 --> 02:12:57.721
"Slavery has always been with us
and is neither sinful nor immoral.

02:13:00.307 --> 02:13:05.437
"Rather, as war and antagonism
are the natural states of man,

02:13:05.562 --> 02:13:10.233
"so, too, slavery,
as natural as it is inevitable."

02:13:12.986 --> 02:13:17.032
Well, gentlemen, I must say I differ
with the keen minds of the South

02:13:17.115 --> 02:13:19.826
and with our President,
who apparently shares their views,

02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:22.829
offering that the natural state
of mankind is instead,

02:13:22.913 --> 02:13:26.541
and I know this is a controversial idea,

02:13:26.625 --> 02:13:28.794
is freedom.

02:13:31.421 --> 02:13:33.382
Is freedom.

02:13:35.133 --> 02:13:37.386
And the proof is the length
to which a man,

02:13:37.469 --> 02:13:39.971
woman or child will go
to regain it, once taken.

02:13:40.764 --> 02:13:43.517
He will break loose his chains.

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.478
He will decimate his enemies.

02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:49.856
He will try and try and try,

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:54.528
against all odds, against all prejudices,

02:13:54.611 --> 02:13:56.530
to get home.

02:14:00.075 --> 02:14:03.954
Cinque, would you stand up,
if you would,

02:14:05.163 --> 02:14:07.624
so everyone can see you.

02:14:10.585 --> 02:14:14.297
This man is black. We can all see that.

02:14:15.507 --> 02:14:19.886
But can we also see as easily
that which is equally true?

02:14:20.387 --> 02:14:24.224
That he is the only
true hero in this room.

02:14:25.142 --> 02:14:28.186
Now, if he were white, he wouldn't be
standing before this court,

02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:29.855
fighting for his life.

02:14:29.938 --> 02:14:32.065
If he were white
and his enslavers were British,

02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:34.067
he wouldn't be able to stand,

02:14:34.151 --> 02:14:35.986
so heavy the weight of
the medals and honors

02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:38.280
we would bestow upon him.

02:14:38.989 --> 02:14:42.242
Songs would be written about him.

02:14:42.325 --> 02:14:45.620
The great authors of our times
would fill books about him.

02:14:45.912 --> 02:14:47.998
His story would be told

02:14:48.081 --> 02:14:51.668
and retold in our classrooms.

02:14:53.587 --> 02:14:57.966
Our children,
because we would make sure of it,

02:14:58.049 --> 02:15:01.720
would know his name
as well as they know Patrick Henry's.

02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:05.807
Yet, if the South is right,

02:15:05.891 --> 02:15:10.145
what are we to do with that
embarrassing, annoying document,

02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:13.690
the Declaration of Independence?

02:15:13.774 --> 02:15:16.610
What of its conceits?

02:15:17.861 --> 02:15:20.280
"All men created equal,"
"inalienable rights,"

02:15:20.363 --> 02:15:23.366
"life, liberty," and so on and so forth?

02:15:25.452 --> 02:15:28.121
What on Earth are we to do with this?

02:15:28.205 --> 02:15:30.791
I have a modest suggestion.

02:15:50.811 --> 02:15:55.190
The other night I was talking
with my friend Cinque.

02:15:55.273 --> 02:15:59.236
He was over at my place, and we were
out in the greenhouse together.

02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.366
And he was explaining to me
how when a member of the Mende,

02:16:04.449 --> 02:16:07.035
that's his people...

02:16:07.118 --> 02:16:09.746
How when a member of the Mende
encounters a situation

02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:13.375
where there appears no hope at all,

02:16:13.458 --> 02:16:16.419
he invokes his ancestors.

02:16:17.128 --> 02:16:19.256
Tradition.

02:16:22.926 --> 02:16:26.888
See, the Mende believe that if one can
summon the spirit of one's ancestors,

02:16:26.972 --> 02:16:30.433
then they have never left,

02:16:30.517 --> 02:16:34.938
and the wisdom and strength
they fathered and inspired

02:16:35.021 --> 02:16:37.440
will come to his aid.

02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.119
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton,

02:16:49.201 --> 02:16:51.871
Benjamin Franklin,

02:16:51.955 --> 02:16:53.957
Thomas Jefferson,

02:16:55.959 --> 02:16:57.919
George Washington,

02:17:01.298 --> 02:17:03.216
John Adams.

02:17:11.558 --> 02:17:15.145
We have long resisted
asking you for guidance.

02:17:15.227 --> 02:17:18.064
Perhaps we have feared in doing so,

02:17:18.147 --> 02:17:20.650
we might acknowledge
that our individuality,

02:17:20.734 --> 02:17:25.155
which we so, so revere,
is not entirely our own.

02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:29.284
Perhaps we've feared

02:17:29.367 --> 02:17:32.329
an appeal to you
might be taken for weakness.

02:17:33.996 --> 02:17:39.335
But we've come to understand, finally,
that this is not so.

02:17:41.171 --> 02:17:44.382
We understand now,

02:17:44.466 --> 02:17:48.011
we've been made to understand

02:17:48.093 --> 02:17:51.348
and to embrace the understanding

02:17:54.017 --> 02:17:59.940
that who we are is who we were.

02:18:09.115 --> 02:18:11.910
We desperately need
your strength and wisdom

02:18:11.993 --> 02:18:17.082
to triumph over our fears,
our prejudices, ourselves.

02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:21.419
Give us the courage to do what is right.

02:18:21.503 --> 02:18:25.423
And if it means civil war,
then let it come.

02:18:27.133 --> 02:18:29.343
And when it does,

02:18:29.427 --> 02:18:31.846
may it be, finally,

02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:35.058
the last battle
of the American Revolution.

02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:46.236
That's all I have to say.

02:19:31.823 --> 02:19:37.745
In the case of <i>The United States
of America v. The Amistad Africans,</i>

02:19:37.829 --> 02:19:40.707
it is the opinion of this court

02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:45.335
that our treaty of 1795 with Spain,

02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:50.008
on which the prosecution has
primarily based its arguments,

02:19:50.133 --> 02:19:52.802
is inapplicable.

02:19:52.886 --> 02:19:56.222
While it is clearly stipulated in Article 9

02:19:56.306 --> 02:20:00.894
that, and I quote,
seized ships and cargo

02:20:00.977 --> 02:20:04.647
are to be returned entirely
to their proprietary,

02:20:05.315 --> 02:20:06.691
the end of quote,

02:20:06.775 --> 02:20:09.694
it has not been shown
to the court's satisfaction

02:20:10.403 --> 02:20:14.199
that these particular Africans
fit that description.

02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:18.203
We are then left with the alternative,

02:20:18.286 --> 02:20:21.081
that they are not slaves

02:20:21.164 --> 02:20:24.501
and therefore cannot
be considered merchandise

02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:29.547
but are, rather, free individuals

02:20:29.631 --> 02:20:33.093
with certain legal and moral rights,

02:20:33.176 --> 02:20:36.888
including the right
to engage in insurrection

02:20:36.971 --> 02:20:41.434
against those who would
deny them their freedom.

02:20:41.518 --> 02:20:45.105
And therefore, over one dissent,

02:20:45.188 --> 02:20:46.773
it is the court's judgment

02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:51.319
that the defendants are to be
released from custody at once

02:20:52.403 --> 02:20:54.823
and, if they so choose,

02:20:54.906 --> 02:20:58.701
to be returned to their homes in Africa.

02:21:16.136 --> 02:21:18.054
Good job.

02:21:18.138 --> 02:21:19.931
Thank you.

02:21:26.563 --> 02:21:27.730
Well...

02:21:33.319 --> 02:21:35.905
What did you say to them?

02:21:39.367 --> 02:21:42.704
What words did you use
to persuade them?

02:21:44.747 --> 02:21:46.082
Yours.

02:22:29.125 --> 02:22:31.544
To keep you safe.

02:23:07.163 --> 02:23:12.710
Thank you, Baldwin.

02:23:57.714 --> 02:24:02.468
The Liberation of Lomboko Slave Fortress

02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:07.890
Fire!

02:24:09.350 --> 02:24:12.562
Let's get a move on! Lively now!

02:24:42.258 --> 02:24:44.427
All clear, sir.

02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:46.262
- Fire.
- Fire!

02:24:50.933 --> 02:24:52.560
- Fire.
- Fire!

02:24:57.523 --> 02:24:58.983
Fire.

02:25:02.236 --> 02:25:03.237
Fire.

02:25:04.697 --> 02:25:05.782
Fire.

02:25:12.622 --> 02:25:18.920
William Henry Harrison defeated Martin Van Buren
to become the ninth President of the United States.

02:25:24.008 --> 02:25:25.635
<i>Take a letter, Ensign.</i>

02:25:26.677 --> 02:25:31.349
To His Honor, the United States
Secretary of State, Mr. John Forsyth.

02:25:31.432 --> 02:25:33.226
"My dear Mr. Forsyth,

02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:37.772
"it is my great pleasure to inform you
that you are, in fact, correct.

02:25:38.314 --> 02:25:42.777
"The slave fortress in Sierra Leone
does not exist."

02:26:45.798 --> 02:26:52.054
Queen Isabella of Spain continued to argue the
Amistad matter with seven more American Presidents.

02:27:00.104 --> 02:27:06.527
In 1864, her hopes of "compensation" finally collapsed
with the Confederate Army's defeat at Atlanta.

02:27:10.406 --> 02:27:16.579
Cinque returned to Sierra Leone
to find his own people engaged in civil war.

02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:21.417
His village was destroyed and his family gone.

02:27:22.293 --> 02:27:26.464
It is believed they were sold into slavery.
