(ECHOES) Mom!

01:56.118 --> 01:57.160
Mom!

01:58.203 --> 02:00.539
We should go home now.
I think it's dinnertime.

JANE: Let's get you something to eat.
What should we make?

02:12.676 --> 02:14.636
ZIGGY: Uh... Pizza!

02:14.720 --> 02:17.306
JANE: No, not pizza again.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.479
AMABELLA: She's not coming?

02:25.814 --> 02:28.233
Well, she really wants to, sweetheart.

02:29.568 --> 02:31.903
Turns out she has a conflict.

02:32.529 --> 02:39.411
It so happens that your party
is on the same exact day as <i>Disney</i> On <i>Ice.</i>

02:42.289 --> 02:46.126
But if Chloe doesn't come,
is everybody else coming?

02:46.543 --> 02:48.128
Almost everybody.

02:48.712 --> 02:52.299
Um, there are a few others
who are going to the other thing.

02:52.674 --> 02:54.009
How many?

02:54.468 --> 02:55.761
I'm not exactly sure.

02:55.844 --> 02:57.346
How many about?

02:57.804 --> 02:59.473
I think six.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.937
Honey, but everybody else
in the whole class is coming.

03:06.688 --> 03:10.025
It's going to be an incredible party.
Come here. Come.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.610
(GRUNTS)

03:12.319 --> 03:13.570
Hey...

03:14.237 --> 03:16.031
It's a beautiful weekend.

03:16.365 --> 03:19.076
Look, they're setting up games.

03:19.159 --> 03:24.081
There's going to be a bouncy,
a magician, princesses,

03:24.873 --> 03:29.419
Spider-Man for the boys.
It's going to be the best birthday party ever.

03:29.669 --> 03:33.215
Of course it's going to be
the best birthday party ever!

03:33.298 --> 03:36.009
Get over here, you little punk! Huh?

03:36.802 --> 03:38.637
Do me a favor.
Get your swimsuit on, all right?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.138
I'll meet you in the pool. Five minutes.

03:40.222 --> 03:43.266
Ready? Go, go, go!
Four minutes! Three minutes!

03:46.728 --> 03:51.024
- What's going on?
- Six kids aren't coming tomorrow. Six.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.611
It was a mistake to not invite Ziggy Chapman.

03:55.153 --> 03:57.948
Yeah, I kind of felt bad
about accepting those tickets.

03:58.031 --> 04:02.869
But they're so expensive, and plus
Lily didn't know Amabella from a tree trunk.

04:02.953 --> 04:06.373
Honey, he tried to choke her.

04:06.915 --> 04:09.584
She's afraid of him.
How can we possibly invite him?

04:09.668 --> 04:12.963
Yeah, but with Chloe Mackenzie
not coming and...

04:13.046 --> 04:14.297
(SIGHS)

04:15.465 --> 04:17.509
That fucking Madeline!

04:17.926 --> 04:20.720
Honey, it's gonna be a spectacular party.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.433
Amabella is going to have the time of her life.

04:25.892 --> 04:27.436
I want to kill her.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.652
PERRY: Hey, are we going
to some kid's birthday party tomorrow?

04:35.735 --> 04:36.820
CELESTE: Oh.

04:36.903 --> 04:39.823
I ran into Reed Whittaker today,
and he seemed to think we were.

04:39.906 --> 04:44.828
For about 10 seconds, but then
Madeline got tickets to <i>Disney</i> On <i>Ice.</i>

04:46.246 --> 04:47.956
Truly. (CHUCKLES)

04:48.582 --> 04:51.293
The kids are excited, actually.

04:51.376 --> 04:52.544
Okay.

04:53.712 --> 04:57.090
And, what,
I'm not invited to this Disney thing?

04:58.717 --> 05:02.179
Come on. You don't want to go to that.
You hate those things.

05:02.262 --> 05:05.682
You don't think I wanna spend some time
with my family after being gone all week?

05:07.642 --> 05:09.728
Well, why didn't we discuss this?

05:12.105 --> 05:14.983
- No, let's not... (SIGHS)
- No, why didn't we discuss it?

05:16.193 --> 05:17.527
Well, it just...

05:18.320 --> 05:20.113
It wasn't like that. I don't know.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.783
Madeline got the tickets and...

05:25.327 --> 05:26.453
And there were only so many.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.246
So it's a money thing.
We couldn't afford a ticket.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.665
No, it's not that. It's... Take my ticket.

05:30.749 --> 05:33.084
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

05:33.168 --> 05:34.377
The point is that one second,

05:34.461 --> 05:36.796
they're going to some kid's birthday party
that I didn't know about.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.632
The next, you've decided
to take them to a show.

05:38.715 --> 05:40.342
- Come on, Perry.
- What, am I not a member of this family?

05:40.425 --> 05:42.260
Sometimes I have to make decisions
when you're...

05:42.344 --> 05:43.720
You don't think it'd be nice for Josh and Max

05:43.803 --> 05:46.056
to spend a little time with their dad
who's been gone all week?

05:46.139 --> 05:47.641
All right. It... (SCOFFS)

05:47.724 --> 05:50.060
- Do you think I want to be away all the time?
- No.

05:50.143 --> 05:52.312
- Do you think I enjoy missing our family?
- No.

05:53.230 --> 05:55.106
Look at me, then. Look at me.

05:55.524 --> 05:56.650
(SOFTLY) Come on.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.485
Huh?

05:58.568 --> 05:59.945
No, you're hurting me.

06:00.028 --> 06:01.738
- Oh, I'm hurting you.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:02.656 --> 06:04.824
Can we talk about how much you hurt me?

06:06.576 --> 06:09.746
Do you deliberately plan these things
to avoid having to be with me?

06:12.749 --> 06:14.543
Take your hand off me.

06:17.337 --> 06:19.130
You could've bought another ticket.

06:20.924 --> 06:22.259
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

06:28.306 --> 06:30.141
I will leave you.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.855
You touch me like that again,
and I will fucking leave you!

06:47.993 --> 06:49.828
(WHIMPERING)

06:51.204 --> 06:52.706
<i>QUMLAN: The injuries were many.</i>

06:52.914 --> 06:56.251
<i>And they were severe.
We are talking multiple broken bones.</i>

07:00.505 --> 07:01.756
CHLOE: Indians?

07:01.840 --> 07:04.884
Native Americans, honey. Lots of people
have Native-American ancestors.

07:05.010 --> 07:07.137
It looks like an Indian.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.638
Your father will explain.

07:08.722 --> 07:13.184
It's not fair.
Joey's ancestor is Christopher Columbus.

07:13.852 --> 07:15.895
Mmm. He killed lots of Indians.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.398
- That's not helpful.
-It's actually true.

07:18.607 --> 07:19.774

07:19.858 --> 07:22.193
I don't want to do a family tree.

07:22.736 --> 07:24.779
Well, you have to, honey. It's the assignment.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.906
You wanna do well in school, right, Chloe?

07:27.032 --> 07:28.241
Listen to your sister.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.660
If you don't excel in first grade,
you won't get into private school.

07:30.744 --> 07:33.913
And then you can forget about Stanford.
And then what's the point?

07:34.748 --> 07:36.207
Don't listen to your sister.

07:36.291 --> 07:38.376
How much longer
are we gonna beat this dead horse?

07:38.460 --> 07:39.919
- I was just kidding.
- Wait. Who beats horses?

07:40.587 --> 07:42.547
- Nobody, honey.

And, uh... Well, I think you were right.

08:06.488 --> 08:07.530
I see.

<i>It was wrong of me
to exclude Ziggy Chapman from the party.</i>

I'd like to invite him after all.</i>

08:15.413 --> 08:17.749
<i>And, of course, have Chloe there.</i>

It would be so great.
Amabella is so fond of her, as you know.

08:21.836 --> 08:24.381
Um, would you happen to have
Jane's number?

08:24.464 --> 08:25.965

all driving to San Jose for <i>Disney</i> On <i>Ice.</i>

Oh, uh...

08:34.640 --> 08:36.393
Well, I just... lthought...

08:36.476 --> 08:39.479
Well, maybe we can swing by afterwards.
How late will the party be going until?

08:39.604 --> 08:40.980
<i>3100.</i>

08:41.106 --> 08:43.107
No, we won't be back by then.

08:43.274 --> 08:46.486
But there's got to be something
we can do, right?

08:46.653 --> 08:47.946
<i>(SIGHS) If only there was.</i>

08:48.363 --> 08:51.825

08:53.660 --> 08:56.579
Chloe and the others come to the party,
big smiles on their faces.

08:56.663 --> 09:00.291
Right? And after, I arrange

09:00.375 --> 09:02.919
a great sleepover weekend trip to Disneyland,

09:03.002 --> 09:08.967
all-expense paid, VIP passes, the works.
Backstage passes to Frozen. (CHUCKLES)

09:09.217 --> 09:11.136
Yeah, it's not going to work.

09:13.638 --> 09:15.724
I'll even get Snow White
to sit on your husband's face.

as is your fucking puppet show.

be nice to Bonnie,

to Bonnie or that my father should care?

or the films our children can watch.

15:36.187 --> 15:38.523
I told the Mayor
we might consider legal recourse

15:38.648 --> 15:41.317

15:52.411 --> 15:54.372
It just pisses me off because in large part,

15:54.497 --> 15:58.918
this has to do with Renata Klein

the likes of Celeste and Perry Wright

Lately, it doesn't always seem

27:30.901 --> 27:33.070
or figure me out or something.

27:34.655 --> 27:36.573

27:38.867 --> 27:42.079
That, you know, the day would come
where she would just...

not love me anymore, and...

like a therapist or a counselor or someone?

41:30.406 --> 41:32.825
You're the first person I've ever told.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

41:32.909 --> 41:34.243
Oh, honey.

41:35.244 --> 41:37.497
You know, there was a point
where I thought that I had moved on,

41:37.580 --> 41:39.248
that I had worked through it

41:40.500 --> 41:44.420
and whatnot, but, no,
I know that I'll never be over it.

41:44.921 --> 41:47.840
But I know that I have to keep
moving forward, you know?

41:48.424 --> 41:49.550
That kid is...

41:51.886 --> 41:53.388
He's gonna have a good life.

41:56.891 --> 41:59.936
But the name of his father is not going
on that fucking poster board.

42:23.876 --> 42:25.753

42:35.847 --> 42:37.807

(ENGINE TURNS OVER)

43:10.673 --> 43:13.342
- You're never going to believe this.
- Hey.

43:13.426 --> 43:18.389
The theme for the school party
is Elvis Presley and Audrey Hepburn.

43:18.723 --> 43:20.558
Oh, dear God, no.

43:20.641 --> 43:22.852
Exactly. Where's Amabella?

43:24.687 --> 43:26.314
She's in her room.

43:28.775 --> 43:30.735
I'm admiring how beautiful...

43:32.737 --> 43:35.573
Remember, after the remodel,
we just walked around,

43:35.656 --> 43:37.992
staring at how perfect everything was?

43:39.744 --> 43:41.829
Can't make a perfect world.

43:41.913 --> 43:44.081
No matter what, shit happens.

43:48.836 --> 43:50.880
It felt really nice to be desired today.

43:53.549 --> 43:55.968
It meant a lot. Thank you.

43:57.887 --> 43:58.930
Honey,

44:00.264 --> 44:04.435
I always desire you.
Usually, it just annoys you.

44:05.311 --> 44:08.773
No, you want to have sex all the time.

44:11.609 --> 44:13.820
Today, you desired me.

44:44.267 --> 44:46.143

(HEAVY BREATHING)

45:05.329 --> 45:07.123
<i>HARPER: We still don't know
the truth about Jane.</i>

45:07.790 --> 45:08.958
I'm just saying.

45:19.594 --> 45:21.429
GABRIELLE: <i>Madeline had anger issues.</i>

45:21.679 --> 45:23.764
ltty bitty ball of rage.

45:26.100 --> 45:29.687
<i>HARPER: Want to see her rage issues?
Call her "itty bitty."</i>

45:30.813 --> 45:33.608
<i>STU: Renata had the whole kind
of sexy praying mantis,</i>

45:33.691 --> 45:36.360
<i>"bite your head off after sex" thing going.</i>

45:36.694 --> 45:39.196
<i>MELISSA: Oh, yeah, that Bonnie's
just the sweetest thing.</i>

45:40.197 --> 45:41.240
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

<i>NIPPAL: Celeste,
she is an accomplished attorney,</i>

45:43.784 --> 45:45.703
<i>and some people in this town resent that.</i>

45:46.120 --> 45:49.206
Rich, beautiful, madly in love.

45:50.207 --> 45:51.417
Something had to be wrong.

45:57.506 --> 45:58.799
PERRY: (SOFTLY) Hey!

46:01.969 --> 46:03.054
Hey.

46:03.179 --> 46:04.221
What are you thinking?

46:06.933 --> 46:09.727
I'm trying to decide whether I'm happy or sad.

46:10.937 --> 46:12.396
People usually know.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.819
I'm sad because...

46:21.948 --> 46:24.659
Because my husband doubts my love for him.

46:27.078 --> 46:28.579
And happy?

46:30.081 --> 46:33.459
I'm happy because,
the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful

46:36.212 --> 46:37.421
for us.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.764
<i>(HARVEST MOON PLAYING)</i>

46:53.688 --> 46:55.272
Would you dance with me?

46:57.316 --> 47:00.611
I just want to hold you, look into your eyes,

47:02.113 --> 47:03.948
be in love with you,

47:05.157 --> 47:07.034
and feel you being in love with me.

47:09.996 --> 47:11.122
Would you?

47:37.857 --> 47:39.608
(SOFTLY) The most beautiful song

47:41.318 --> 47:43.404
with the most beautiful woman.

48:03.132 --> 48:05.009
Don't give up on me, baby.
