elbow, and teeth
all the way to my soul.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.750
-They're regular eyes.
-Well, you're right.

12:06.750 --> 12:11.040
Being fully human again
is kind of boring. No offense.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.040
Hey, you're in a safe space.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.830
I mean, my life
as a mutated freak
was often gross,

12:15.830 --> 12:19.710
painful, embarrassing...
but so exciting.

12:19.710 --> 12:23.580
I was a valued member
of a team of super-villains.

12:23.580 --> 12:26.080
But then I turned good
and joined the heroes.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.670
And I helped them
save San Fransokyo
and everyone in it.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.580
-I was special.
-No, no, no.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.670
-You are special.
-Aw, thanks, Carl.

12:36.670 --> 12:39.580
You're welcome.
Now, be a champ.
Pick up the check.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.330
I gotta go meet a guy
about a thing.

12:42.330 --> 12:44.120
The guys is my dad
and the thing is
his birthday.

12:46.210 --> 12:48.170
Mm.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.790
(Dibs sighs, groans)

12:57.170 --> 13:00.040
Who's excited
for an artisanal cheese plate?

13:17.580 --> 13:20.210
(alarm beeping)

13:20.210 --> 13:24.380
-Chris: We have a problem.
It escaped.
-Liv: So I see.

13:28.670 --> 13:32.170
-But don't we need it for...
-Dead end. It's too unstable.

13:32.170 --> 13:34.330
It's the city's problem now.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.330
Hello, students.
Honey Lemon,

13:41.330 --> 13:43.250
how is your special
project coming?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.120
It was a complete success.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.040
Globby, or should I say,
Dibs, is cured.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.380
-I knew you could do it.
-But I couldn't have
without Karmi.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.080
Uh, guys.
We have to go.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.670
(screaming)

14:03.710 --> 14:05.960
(roaring)

14:05.960 --> 14:08.170
Oh, no! This is impossible!

14:11.540 --> 14:15.170
-Is it me or is Globby
a lot bigger?
-And meaner?

14:15.170 --> 14:17.750
Yeah. Whatever you
did to him made him
way worse.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.580
He's gone full phase two.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.620
I thought I neutralized
the mutation,

14:21.620 --> 14:24.210
but maybe his cells
were too unstable.

14:24.210 --> 14:27.250
-Whatever. He's going down.
-Wait. He's our friend.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.580
Just let me talk to him,
please.

14:29.580 --> 14:33.250
-Be careful.
-Globby. Globby,
listen to me.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.330
I know I failed you
the first time.

14:35.330 --> 14:37.960
But whatever happened,
I know I can fix it.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.420
You don't have to do this.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.500
(roars)

14:42.420 --> 14:45.460
Listen to me, Globby.
This isn't who you are.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.170
Huh?

14:48.330 --> 14:50.620
I think she's
getting through.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.540
Hey, guys.
Who's the monster?

14:52.540 --> 14:56.620
-Dibs?
-(gasps) It's a whole
new Globby?

14:56.620 --> 14:59.420
Oh, my gosh. I get to name it.
I get to name it. Yes, yes,
yes. It's not...

14:59.420 --> 15:01.960
It's, like, the opposite
of Globby. It's a negative...

15:01.960 --> 15:03.710
Nega-Globby!
Nega-Globby!

15:03.710 --> 15:06.120
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.750
Form of a bull.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.540
Oh, right.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.960
Hiro:
Let's go.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.250
Oh! I'm so glad
you're okay.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.120
But you should
get out of here.
It's not safe.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.250
(growls)

15:30.670 --> 15:33.960
Fred:
All right, Nega-Globby.
Prepare to be fire--

15:33.960 --> 15:36.290
(yells)
Ooh!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.920
(growling)

15:49.380 --> 15:50.920
Whoa!
(grunts)

15:51.790 --> 15:54.040
Okay. That's enough.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.920
(yelling)

15:55.920 --> 15:57.920
(grunting)

16:02.540 --> 16:04.670
(yelling)

16:06.620 --> 16:08.380
(growling)

16:13.670 --> 16:16.710
Hiro:
Baymax, rocket fi--
Whoa, whoa, watch out.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.330
-Baymax: I cannot move.
-(grunting) Me, neither.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.830
Don't worry, guys.
I've got this.

16:27.830 --> 16:29.880
Wait, no!
My purse!

16:34.540 --> 16:36.290
Someone has to help.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.750
(grunting)

16:42.750 --> 16:44.580
(shouts)

16:46.330 --> 16:48.960
(shouting):
Why... won't... you... break?

16:55.420 --> 16:57.750
(shouts)

16:57.750 --> 16:59.540
It's working!

16:59.540 --> 17:02.420
Oh, I forgot how much
this part hurt!

17:02.420 --> 17:04.790
(groaning)

17:05.960 --> 17:09.750
-(roaring)
-Just...
Let's just take it easy,

17:09.750 --> 17:12.460
Nega-Globby.
Nice Nega-Globby.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.250
Guys, my purse is gone.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.920
-Coming. Ow.
-I'm all out.
Fred, where are you?

17:18.920 --> 17:21.670
Um, I have no idea.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.920
(shrieks)

17:29.670 --> 17:31.330
(roars)

17:31.330 --> 17:34.380
-Hiro, I need that prototype!
-I'll signal Skymax.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.080
I just... have to get
to my phone.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.290
Stay back.
(whimpers)

17:41.290 --> 17:42.960
Globby:
Gotcha!

17:44.290 --> 17:46.540
-You're safe now.
-Globby!

17:46.540 --> 17:47.580
You changed back!

17:47.580 --> 17:49.250
You guys needed help.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.080
And I realized being a freak
is my happy place!

17:53.170 --> 17:56.080
Stay here. I'll deal
with the big guy.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.290
Hey!

17:59.540 --> 18:03.000
The position of Globby
has been filled, by me!

18:03.000 --> 18:06.120
And I'm about to show you

Globby ate the other Globby?

20:48.790 --> 20:50.750
Great job.
Both of you.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.750
Yeah. Thanks for
saving our butts.

Baymax:
We are still stuck.

Hiro: I still wonder
where that other
Globby came from.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.460
Nega-Globby. Come on.
Remember I named it,
like, right on the spot?

21:06.460 --> 21:09.960
-It was pretty genius.
-Okay, I wonder where
Nega-Globby came from.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.750
I don't know.
But there have been
a lot of weird things

happening in
this city lately.
