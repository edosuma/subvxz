<i>Hello?</i>

00:41.980 --> 00:43.380
Whoa, whoa...

00:46.700 --> 00:49.180
Hello? Are you okay?

00:49.940 --> 00:53.620
Tickety-boo, madam. I'm just
a window cleaner. I'll be on my way.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.140
Oh, no, no, that's perfect.
This place is on the market

00:56.220 --> 00:57.740
and I want it to be spotless.

00:58.740 --> 00:59.900
Right you are.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.180
The helmet's gone. Shit!

Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:22.540 --> 01:23.820
How are you feeling?

01:24.940 --> 01:26.180
How... how long have I been here?

01:26.260 --> 01:29.260
All night. They scanned you, checked
your pupils, all that kind of stuff.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.700
- Is Dad okay?
- Yeah, he's all good.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.780
- Just a broken leg.
- Oh, not again!

01:32.860 --> 01:35.660
He'll be okay. At least
there wasn't anyone else involved.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.940
I mean, imagine if you'd hit someone,
like what happened to Ash.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.620
Yeah, yeah... I guess.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.380
So have you heard from Will at all?

01:43.460 --> 01:45.820
Yeah. He came into We Cover.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.180
- Mmm.
- Wanted to get a job.

01:48.260 --> 01:51.340
Oh, great. Did he say anything
about why he left?

01:51.420 --> 01:53.980
No. So, what, you haven't heard from him?

01:54.060 --> 01:55.500
Me? No! No, I just wondered.

01:55.980 --> 01:59.300
Anyway, I am so relieved that you're okay.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.460
Oh... Sorry, have you just been sick?

02:04.380 --> 02:05.260
Yeah.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.100
Yeah, I had a...

02:08.180 --> 02:09.740
dodgy sandwich from the cafÃ©.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.940
Hospital food, hey?
No wonder everyone's ill!

02:13.020 --> 02:14.060
Yeah.

02:15.220 --> 02:19.420
Look you... you'd better go.
Go home, get some rest.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.620
Well, let me know if you want me to pick
you up when they discharge you, yeah?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.260
Thanks.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.820
Oh!

02:28.420 --> 02:30.260
Maybe get some... chewing gum.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.380
It's too soon, Chris.

02:38.460 --> 02:41.020
I had a long, hard think
about what happened

02:41.100 --> 02:43.540
and I can now see how crazy I was.

02:43.620 --> 02:47.460
Yes. Russian spies,
armed guards in hospitals?

02:47.540 --> 02:49.620
I mean, I was going to send
you to the loony bin.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.540
I was having trouble at home,
but with the days off,

02:52.620 --> 02:54.020
I've sorted it all out.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.620
I just want to get back to my job
protecting Queen and country.

02:58.820 --> 03:03.060
Well, for now, I'm putting you
on desk duty in an office near me

03:03.140 --> 03:04.860
so I can keep my eye on you.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.980
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Welcome back, Chris.

03:08.820 --> 03:09.980
But let me be clear.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.420
If you try to investigate or approach
those citizens you accused,

03:14.500 --> 03:18.060
you'll be out of that door
with my boot up your backside. Understand?

03:18.140 --> 03:19.260
I do, ma'am.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.020
The police said they think
someone tampered with the brakes.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.340
Really? Sounds a bit far-fetched.

03:27.420 --> 03:30.100
They've got the car
at the bloody station now.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.580
Who knows when I'll get it back.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.220
Your father has a broken leg, Simon.
Er, Daniel.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.500
Yeah.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.060
I knew this would happen,
especially after last time.

03:40.140 --> 03:42.740
Go and dry your eyes, love.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.780
I'm... I'm sorry about your leg.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.820
The state I was in,
it could've been much worse. But...

03:50.900 --> 03:53.620
let's keep that between us men, yes?

03:55.540 --> 03:56.900
Yeah, of course, Dad.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.420
Listen...

04:02.260 --> 04:03.580
whatever happens,

04:03.660 --> 04:05.140
I just want you know that...

04:06.540 --> 04:07.900
I love you and Mum.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.940
I know. We love you too.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.580
Bye, Dad.

04:17.660 --> 04:18.980
Bye, Mum.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.540
Take care of yourselves.

04:22.340 --> 04:24.940
Where are you going?
We still have to speak to the police.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.420
And Simon will be here soon too.

04:27.380 --> 04:29.660
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm just...

04:30.980 --> 04:32.500
I'm just gonna go to the...

04:32.580 --> 04:33.860
newsagent.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.340
Yeah. Get... get a Lucozade.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.940
I'm very proud of you, son.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.300
The way you're handling your illness.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.580
You're not running and hiding. You're...

04:47.620 --> 04:49.020
facing up to your problems.

04:50.140 --> 04:51.340
Thanks, Dad.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.860
Could you pick me up a <i>Daily Mail?</i>

04:55.020 --> 04:56.300
Yeah. Will do.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.500
<i>You're through to the telephone</i>

05:00.580 --> 05:01.980
<i>of Dr. Iain Glennis.</i>

05:02.060 --> 05:05.380
I nearly died in a car crash
because of you. Where's Will?

05:05.460 --> 05:07.380
Did he get to Katerina? Where <i>are</i> you?

05:11.260 --> 05:12.580
Of course.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.700
Dr. Glennis.

05:15.780 --> 05:16.900
Yes?

05:17.220 --> 05:18.100
Daniel?

05:19.260 --> 05:21.140
- Daniel, is that you?
- What happened?

05:23.060 --> 05:24.700
Someone knocked me off my bike.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.700
I spent the night in Kenny West's garden.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.060
I woke up shivering.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.300
Poor little E.T.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.460
What happened to Will?

05:33.540 --> 05:36.220
Well, I don't know.
I was following him and, as I say,

05:36.300 --> 05:40.140
someone knocked me off my bike
before I could find him.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.420
Fuck! He must've told her everything.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.700
The police want to speak to me.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.740
Right, we have to get out of here.
We're wanted men.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.860
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm done.

05:49.620 --> 05:50.740
Just...

05:51.580 --> 05:54.340
leave me here to die. It's my time.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.340
Okay, give me the money, then.

05:58.540 --> 05:59.740
Mmm...

06:00.300 --> 06:02.260
No. The money's mine.

06:02.340 --> 06:03.780
Well, you won't need it if you're dead.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.460
I'm not dead, am I? It's just...

06:06.300 --> 06:07.260
I just need to rest.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.820
Okay, yeah, you can rest

06:08.900 --> 06:11.220
for 15 years in prison.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.780
Righty-ho!

06:15.980 --> 06:17.140
Ah!

06:17.700 --> 06:19.140
I need to get changed.

06:19.220 --> 06:21.860
I can't board an aircraft
looking like this.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.700
- Shit!
- Language!

06:24.300 --> 06:26.740
Passport and the cash,
I've left it in my bag in dad's car.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.140
Go and get it, then.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.020
The car is at the police station.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.940
We'll have to hide somewhere
in the United Kingdom.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.020
Oh, perhaps the Cotswolds.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.540
I would like nothing more
than to stay in the country.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.100
We'll just get caught if we do, okay?
It's not an option.

06:42.220 --> 06:43.980
We've got to get my bag back.

06:44.060 --> 06:47.620
You know they were going to make me
a partner at St Frederick's? But...

06:48.220 --> 06:50.540
What did I do to deserve this?

06:51.100 --> 06:53.500
What did you do? Okay, let me think.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.300
You misdiagnosed me with cancer,

06:55.380 --> 06:56.940
you tried to blackmail me,

06:57.020 --> 06:58.340
you staged a hit and run,

06:58.420 --> 07:00.220
sold prescription drugs
to a drug dealer...

07:00.300 --> 07:02.420
- Want me to carry on?
- It was a rhetorical question.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.940
Let's move.

07:06.980 --> 07:09.100
Oh, took me ages
to fish it out of the tree.

07:11.380 --> 07:15.660
Excuse me. Sorry. Er, my friend
was in a car crash and she's pregnant.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.380
- What's her name?
- Her name? Why?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.740
- Have you come to see her?
- Oh, no.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.540
No, she's, um, she's on another ward.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.900
She just wanted me to come
and ask some questions on her behalf.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.940
Okay, I'll see if I can help.

07:27.220 --> 07:29.020
How many weeks pregnant
do you have to be

07:29.100 --> 07:30.580
to be able to tell who the father is?

07:30.660 --> 07:33.580
Paternity tests during pregnancy
can cause miscarriage.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.100
We don't perform them on the NHS.

07:35.780 --> 07:36.940
Your friend could go private,

07:37.020 --> 07:41.020
but she'd need permission and blood
from both possible fathers.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.620
- Great.
- Was the father in the crash too?

07:44.700 --> 07:46.940
What? No. No. Um...

07:47.380 --> 07:50.180
No, he died in a hit and run accident.

07:50.940 --> 07:52.300
If he <i>is</i> the father.

07:52.860 --> 07:53.980
What ward is she on?

07:54.060 --> 07:55.020
Oh, um...

07:55.740 --> 07:58.100
- I, er... I don't remember.
- What's her name?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.100
Vanessa...

08:01.620 --> 08:02.780
Ward.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.340
Think, Chris, think.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.500
Ah!

08:11.580 --> 08:13.060
Anything I can help you with?

08:13.140 --> 08:16.220
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I'm just, er, doing a crossword.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.220
Oh, I love a crossword.
What are you stuck on?

08:18.300 --> 08:19.180
No!

08:19.980 --> 08:21.340
Sorry. I...

08:21.420 --> 08:25.580
just have a thing about doing crosswords
without any help.

08:25.660 --> 08:26.700
Right, yeah.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.780
Okay, well, er, good luck with it.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.740
Are you sure this outfit suits me?

08:38.140 --> 08:39.580
For the thousandth time, yes!

08:39.659 --> 08:40.740
I don't like panic buying

08:40.820 --> 08:42.340
and I think you really rushed me
in that shop.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.540
We're in danger of being arrested
and sent to prison.

08:44.620 --> 08:45.780
Who cares what you look like?

08:45.860 --> 08:48.140
- I care.
- Look, just wait here

08:48.660 --> 08:50.180
and look for a black cab.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.860
Or I could get on the line and see
if I can order us a You-Ber.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.180
No, no, because there'll be a record,
okay? Black cabs, they're anonymous.

08:56.820 --> 08:59.060
- Right, yes.
- We've just got to get in and out

08:59.140 --> 09:01.500
without drawing any attention
to ourselves, okay?

09:01.580 --> 09:03.620
Ah, good morning. Hello.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.060
Thank you for your service.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.420
All right, here goes.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.140
Good luck, Daniel!

09:12.700 --> 09:16.980
Wherever you are,
I'm gonna find you and bring you down.

09:18.300 --> 09:22.020
Hello, young sir. How can I be
of assistance this fine day?

09:22.100 --> 09:23.940
Ah, yeah, er, bit of a long story...

09:24.620 --> 09:25.540
Bingo.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.700
Always got time for a long story. Save me
having to chat with this lot!

09:30.700 --> 09:33.020
Me and my dad,
we were in a car accident yesterday.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.900
- Oh, are you okay?
- I'm fine, yeah.

09:35.980 --> 09:38.180
- And how's Dad?
- He broke his leg.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.260
Thanks for asking.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.540
Um, so his car is in your pound

09:42.620 --> 09:44.220
and my bag's in it.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.900
Right, well, through the wonders
of modern technology,

09:47.980 --> 09:50.500
I will be able to tell you
if that is the case.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.780
- What's Dad's name?
- Gordon Glass.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.260
Glass? Oh, no wonder he broke his leg
if he was in a car accident!

09:56.340 --> 09:58.460
Shattered, was it?

09:59.620 --> 10:00.980
Right, yes, here we are.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.700
A Toyota Rav 4?

10:03.780 --> 10:05.220
Yeah, that's the one.

10:05.300 --> 10:09.060
Hmm. Suspected tampering
of the front hydraulic brake system.

10:09.140 --> 10:12.060
Anyway, I don't actually need the car,
just my bag.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.300
It's not full of guns, drug money,
fake ID and bombs, is it?

10:15.380 --> 10:16.700
No, no.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.060
Where's that bloody pen?

10:28.060 --> 10:29.940
Well, I hate to the bearer of bad news,

10:30.020 --> 10:33.700
but I can't give you access to the car
or its contents.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.020
I can let Dad, though.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.180
Oh! He's shattered his leg, hasn't he?

10:38.260 --> 10:40.340
- Yeah, he broke it.
- Yeah.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.260
There's no way
I can just go and get the bag?

10:42.340 --> 10:46.620
No, it's frustrating, but those are
the rules. They are the rules.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.900
Those are the <i>bloody</i> rules!

10:48.980 --> 10:50.940
And, alas, I did not make the rules,
and if I did,

10:51.020 --> 10:52.300
I'd make a new rule that would state

10:52.380 --> 10:54.980
that you'd be allowed to go and get
your bag back. Is Dad not available?

10:56.060 --> 10:57.900
Let me find out. Thanks.

10:57.980 --> 11:00.020
Not at all. That's our job.

11:06.340 --> 11:08.220
Chris, have you finished your crossword?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.380
- What did he want?
- Oh, you recognized him too?

11:10.460 --> 11:12.700
Yeah that's the, er,
cancer lad off of the posters.

11:12.780 --> 11:13.980
Yes. What did he want?

11:14.060 --> 11:17.660
Well, he was in a road accident
and his bag's still in the car.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.700
It's his dad's car
and it's out back because of, er,

11:19.780 --> 11:23.140
a suspected brake tampering.
The price of fame, I suppose.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.380
His bag's in the car?

11:24.460 --> 11:26.900
Yeah, he wanted it back, but I said
I can only sign it out to his dad...

11:28.460 --> 11:29.580
Those are the rules.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.460
Ah, did you get it?

11:34.540 --> 11:37.500
Yeah. Here it is. Wanna put any of
your invisible things in it?

11:37.580 --> 11:39.940
No need to be facetious. What happened?

11:40.020 --> 11:41.420
They'd only sign it out to my dad.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.700
Cotswolds it is.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.300
Unless...

11:44.780 --> 11:47.660
I am Mr. Glass.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.140
I'm Daniel's father.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.065
Erm... I'm Daniel's father.

12:01.145 --> 12:02.425
married to his...

12:03.225 --> 12:07.025
mother, Mrs. Glass, who's a lovely lady.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.505
And your first name?

12:10.305 --> 12:12.225
It is Mr...

12:12.305 --> 12:14.665
- It's Gordon.
- Gordon Glass.

12:14.745 --> 12:18.945
Sorry. I took a bump on the old noggin.

12:19.025 --> 12:20.825
Yeah. And how's Dad feeling?

12:20.905 --> 12:23.225
Because Daniel said you'd broken your leg.

12:24.865 --> 12:25.905
Yes.

12:25.985 --> 12:30.025
Yes. Er, I've actually got one of
those new ultra-thin casts on,

12:30.105 --> 12:32.625
so I barely... Oh, sorry.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.545
I barely know it's there.

12:34.625 --> 12:36.345
Incredible you're walking on it.

12:36.425 --> 12:38.105
Yes. Yes, er...

12:38.185 --> 12:40.705
So if Dad would just like to
show me some ID.

12:43.625 --> 12:44.745
ID?

12:44.825 --> 12:46.425
Yeah, passport, driver's licence.

12:46.505 --> 12:49.185
I know you drive
because we've got your car!

12:49.265 --> 12:51.105
Yes. Yes, I...

12:51.505 --> 12:52.705
No, I just don't have...

12:52.785 --> 12:54.625
Dad's wallet hasn't been recovered yet.

12:54.705 --> 12:56.105
Oh! Oh, that <i>is</i> a pickle.

12:56.185 --> 12:57.225
Hmm.

12:57.785 --> 13:00.585
Toot-toot! Follow me, young man.
Back in a jiffy.

13:01.385 --> 13:03.465
It's against the rules, as you know,

13:03.545 --> 13:05.465
but seeing as you're a special case,

13:05.545 --> 13:08.225
why doesn't Dad take a seat,
rest his poorly leg.

13:08.305 --> 13:10.345
- Thank you.
- Come on, Daniel.

13:19.025 --> 13:21.065
Oh, quite a prang.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.465
Yeah. Yeah, they said
we're lucky to be alive.

13:24.545 --> 13:25.745
Yeah.

13:25.825 --> 13:29.265
Officer Hayward.
What... what have you been up to?

13:29.705 --> 13:32.865
Pursuing criminals.
Patrick, I can take it from here.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.665
Really? I thought the gaffer
wanted you to stay at your desk?

13:35.745 --> 13:37.145
I've cleared it with her.

13:37.905 --> 13:40.065
Yeah, actually, I'd better be off as well.

13:40.465 --> 13:41.665
Don't you wanna get your bag?

13:43.105 --> 13:45.065
Do you know,
I can't see it anywhere, so...

13:45.145 --> 13:47.785
You can head back, Patrick.
If it's here, I'm sure we'll find it.

13:48.545 --> 13:49.945
Right, well, er...

13:50.985 --> 13:52.985
I'll be with Dad, then, yeah. Mr. Glass.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.665
See you in a mo.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.185
Want to look for your bag in the back?
It's not in the boot.

14:00.265 --> 14:02.345
Do you know,
I really don't think it's in there.

14:03.345 --> 14:04.425
What's in the bag, Daniel?

14:05.825 --> 14:07.345
Mmm, let me think...

14:07.825 --> 14:08.905
Er...

14:10.305 --> 14:11.345
gym stuff...

14:14.025 --> 14:14.945
medication...

14:17.225 --> 14:18.985
- library... library books.
- Library books?

14:19.065 --> 14:20.145
Yeah.

14:20.225 --> 14:22.745
- They're overdue.
- Books about what?

14:23.665 --> 14:24.865
Animals.

14:25.545 --> 14:26.985
Animal books.

14:28.305 --> 14:29.345
Birds.

14:31.945 --> 14:33.305
- Mammals.
- Cor!

14:33.385 --> 14:35.865
I wouldn't mind seeing those.
Shall we have a look for it?

14:35.945 --> 14:37.465
- I really don't think it's in there.
- Bingo!

14:38.145 --> 14:39.345
You're in luck.

14:40.585 --> 14:41.865
Oh!

14:42.745 --> 14:45.745
Er, no. That's... that's not mine.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.745
You came here looking for a rucksack
that you claimed

14:48.825 --> 14:52.625
was in the back of your father's car,
but it's not <i>this</i> rucksack?

14:54.025 --> 14:55.305
Yeah, no.

14:55.385 --> 14:57.105
No, I've never... never seen that one.

14:57.185 --> 14:58.345
Open it, mate.

14:58.425 --> 15:00.225
It's, it's, it's not mine.

15:00.305 --> 15:01.545
Open the bag, Daniel.

15:02.665 --> 15:03.825
I don't want to.

15:06.665 --> 15:08.385
Open it.

15:24.385 --> 15:27.905
Daniel Glass?
Chief Superintendent Christine Henchy.

15:28.665 --> 15:31.385
Would you mind coming with me?
I just... I need a little word.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.345
Yeah.

15:34.745 --> 15:35.865
Yeah.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.425
Would you take him to my office, please?

15:42.505 --> 15:43.545
Yes, ma'am.

15:47.345 --> 15:48.825
I'm impressed, Chris.

15:49.225 --> 15:51.585
The subject of
your crazy little investigation

15:51.665 --> 15:53.505
has been in the building today
and you left him alone.

15:53.585 --> 15:54.905
Well done. I'm proud of you.

15:54.985 --> 15:57.745
Of course, ma'am.
That's all behind me now.

15:58.145 --> 15:59.305
Mm-hm.

16:15.545 --> 16:17.465
Oh, where's Dad off to in such a rush?

16:17.545 --> 16:19.665
My tummy has taken a turn
for the worse, I think.

16:19.745 --> 16:20.985
I need to use your facilities.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.585
Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Straight down there,

16:23.665 --> 16:24.825
second door on the left.

16:24.905 --> 16:27.945
Just make sure you go into the one with
the picture of the fella, not the lady.

16:44.905 --> 16:47.745
<i>When the female
grey squirrel becomes receptive,</i>

16:47.825 --> 16:49.145
<i>males come from all round.</i>

16:49.225 --> 16:50.345
CONSIDERING ABORTION?
FIND A CLINIC

16:50.425 --> 16:52.905
<i>...the most dominant
getting to mate with her first.</i>

16:53.425 --> 16:56.065
<i>The other males
mate with her after he is finished.</i>

16:56.665 --> 16:57.825
<i>Then the males depart,</i>

16:57.905 --> 17:00.825
<i>having nothing else to do with
the female or the young,</i>

17:00.905 --> 17:02.745
<i>whichever one of them is the father.</i>

17:04.145 --> 17:06.865
Is that... is that necessary?

17:06.944 --> 17:08.385
Oh, it's just standard procedure.

17:08.785 --> 17:12.345
So, now, tell me about your friend, Will.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.665
- Will...
- Your work colleague,

17:16.744 --> 17:20.545
Linda Zarafa,
she said that you were his best friend.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.865
Oh, yeah...

17:23.464 --> 17:24.545
Will.

17:25.385 --> 17:28.705
Er, yeah, he's not my best friend.
He's... I hardly know him.

17:29.305 --> 17:31.025
But he was staying at your flat?

17:32.145 --> 17:33.465
What's this about?

17:33.545 --> 17:37.345
Well, your friend, Will,
paid a visit to your boss's house.

17:38.185 --> 17:40.305
<i>Everyone's gonna learn
the truth about you.</i>

17:40.385 --> 17:41.785
<i>You're fucked!</i>

17:42.705 --> 17:44.305
Daniel, are you okay?
Do you need some water?

17:44.745 --> 17:46.825
- I should have a lawyer present.
- What?

17:46.905 --> 17:50.185
If I'm gonna answer any more questions,
I should have a lawyer present.

17:50.265 --> 17:51.545
No, you don't need a lawyer.

17:53.465 --> 17:54.545
Thank you.

17:55.825 --> 18:00.145
Miss West. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry
for everything that's happened.

18:00.225 --> 18:02.465
Why? Did you send him to my home?

18:03.705 --> 18:05.545
- No.
- Then how is it your fault he died?

18:06.945 --> 18:09.265
Sorry... what? Will's dead?

18:10.065 --> 18:13.945
Yes. His body was found on the estate
of Miss West's father.

18:14.025 --> 18:15.465
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

18:15.785 --> 18:17.745
What? What happened?

18:28.225 --> 18:29.665
Thank you. Thank you for your help.

18:29.745 --> 18:32.185
- Mr. Glass, your son's in with...
- Goodbye.

18:33.065 --> 18:34.465
Such a lovely family.

18:39.145 --> 18:41.505
He was trying to access the property.

18:41.585 --> 18:45.705
Miss Zarafa found the body. I'm afraid
Will died in a rather horrific accident.

18:49.025 --> 18:52.865
I've seen loads of dead bodies,
but this one was pretty gross.

18:54.185 --> 18:57.465
I was helping Miss West after the funeral,

18:58.345 --> 19:00.665
listing her father's belongings to sell,

19:00.745 --> 19:01.985
when suddenly Katerina came up

19:02.105 --> 19:04.465
saying she heard a scream
coming from the end of the driveway.

19:04.545 --> 19:05.905
I just heard screaming...

19:07.705 --> 19:09.865
And we saw the blood right away.

19:11.425 --> 19:14.225
It was Will.
He got trapped in the electric gate.

19:14.305 --> 19:15.505
His head was completely squashed.

19:15.585 --> 19:17.705
Oh, wow.

19:17.785 --> 19:18.785
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

19:19.585 --> 19:21.545
Do you know any reason why

19:21.625 --> 19:23.905
Will would break into Miss West's
property yesterday?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.785
Maybe he was trying to find a job
at We Cover.

19:28.865 --> 19:31.465
Yeah. Yeah, he did say that.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.545
So are you telling me that your friend
climbed an electric gate

19:34.625 --> 19:36.145
just to ask for a job?

19:36.825 --> 19:39.225
I really think gorillas
are smarter than humans.

19:39.305 --> 19:42.705
We rather suspect his intentions
were more sinister than that.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.705
We found multiple IDs on Will's body,
none of which were real.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.225
Far be it for me
to speak ill of the dead,

19:49.305 --> 19:52.385
but I think you're all rather lucky
he got mangled in that gate.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.425
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.865
I'm keeping it, Ash.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.985
I don't know if it's yours

20:07.065 --> 20:09.025
or Daniel's, but, um...

20:10.105 --> 20:11.505
I'm gonna call it Ash.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.785
Or Ashley if it's a girl.

20:15.825 --> 20:18.065
And I'm gonna love it,
because it's all I have left of you.

20:22.505 --> 20:23.905
Please don't be Daniel's!

20:27.665 --> 20:28.985
What happened to you, then?

20:29.345 --> 20:33.945
Well, I saw Miss West
and, er, Linda arrive and...

20:35.345 --> 20:36.425
I just left.

20:36.505 --> 20:37.745
You left me in the lurch.

20:38.225 --> 20:39.385
Sorry.

20:41.105 --> 20:44.745
Not all bad, though, is it?
I mean, as you said,

20:45.145 --> 20:49.105
Will died before he had a chance
to speak to Katerina, yes?

20:49.705 --> 20:51.625
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

20:51.705 --> 20:53.305
And no one saw the drugs money.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.865
I think we're probably out of the woods.

20:57.825 --> 20:59.225
Well done, Dad.

21:00.505 --> 21:02.465
Oh!

21:04.345 --> 21:05.545
Thank you, son!

21:06.665 --> 21:08.865
I don't, er, have a son, as you know.

21:08.945 --> 21:10.385
I don't have any children.

21:11.065 --> 21:14.345
But if I did have a son,
I'd like him to be a bit like you.

21:15.305 --> 21:19.105
Obviously not such a liar
or a potty-mouth, but...

21:24.265 --> 21:28.425
Hey, hey. You know the deal.
It was 50/50.

21:28.505 --> 21:31.425
It's not for you. I don't want it on me
when I leave Becca.

21:31.505 --> 21:33.905
Just need you to... look after it.

21:33.985 --> 21:35.825
- Oh.
- Until I move out.

21:35.905 --> 21:37.145
Right, yes.

21:37.225 --> 21:40.025
As soon as we've launched
this charity campaign,

21:40.105 --> 21:43.585
we can end this cancer lie for good.

21:44.425 --> 21:47.345
Ha! I think we could've really
made a go of it in the Cotswolds,

21:47.425 --> 21:49.105
Oh, do you want it?

21:49.185 --> 21:50.145
No.

21:55.825 --> 21:58.625
Don't talk to me like that.
You'd have done the same thing.

21:58.705 --> 21:59.825
Listen.

21:59.905 --> 22:03.025
<i>No one will ever know I faked cancer.</i>

22:03.105 --> 22:05.465
But I know,
you little piece of fucking shit!

22:05.545 --> 22:06.865
Now you do too.

22:13.905 --> 22:15.065
Oh, dear.

22:19.585 --> 22:20.665
Oh.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.145
In you go, Mr. Helmet.
