resources behind the ones

04:22.657 --> 04:26.637
Because I'm not ready to
accept that we can't save her.

04:27.562 --> 04:31.488

cognitive impairment, no?

04:31.551 --> 04:32.766
Mm-hmm.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.217
While she is showing signs of paralysis,

07:20.252 --> 07:21.852
it's most likely temporary.

07:21.887 --> 07:24.855

injury from the long flight.

Must've jammed it when
he slammed on the brakes.

09:34.052 --> 09:35.686
And the longer it's out?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.655
The higher the risk
of avascular necrosis.

09:37.689 --> 09:38.756
Exactly.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.157
Get me the FastSCAN.

09:40.192 --> 09:41.826
You ever reduce a hip?

09:41.860 --> 09:42.927
I've seen it done a bunch of times.

09:42.961 --> 09:44.161
I'll talk you through it.

09:44.196 --> 09:47.064
70 milligrams of ketamine.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.835
You're gonna pull on that hip

09:50.869 --> 09:52.870
until you feel it pop back
into the socket.

09:52.904 --> 09:54.772
- Relax, relax, relax, relax.

09:54.806 --> 09:58.809
- Relax. Hold tight.

10:00.212 --> 10:02.746
- It popped back in.
- Good work.

10:02.781 --> 10:04.014
Her belly's full of blood.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.783
- BP's dropping.
- Alright, Maggie.

Call the OR,
tell them we're on our way up.

Copy.

10:10.055 --> 10:12.423
Oh, my God. Did I kill her?

10:16.484 --> 10:18.951
Next one is, if I were very sick,

10:18.985 --> 10:22.107
I would like to do everything
possible to prolong my life.

10:22.209 --> 10:25.445
Very true, mostly true, you
don't know, mostly false...

10:25.479 --> 10:28.677
- That's very true.
- Very true.

10:29.049 --> 10:32.185
Yeah, the doctors did explain
to you the benefits

10:32.219 --> 10:34.253
of antiretroviral therapy, didn't they?

10:34.288 --> 10:35.722
That it would prolong your life.

10:35.756 --> 10:37.836
They say I won't get sick anymore.

10:37.861 --> 10:39.125
So could you tell me then,

10:39.159 --> 10:42.228
why it is that you
don't wanna take an HIV test?

10:43.797 --> 10:45.131
Auntie.

10:45.165 --> 10:47.066
What are you doing here?

10:47.101 --> 10:48.868
You should be at work.

I am a doctor, yes. I'm Dr. Charles.

What's wrong with her?
My baby is always getting sick.

10:55.442 --> 10:57.243
I told you on the phone, auntie.

10:57.277 --> 10:58.878
It's just the flu.

10:58.912 --> 11:00.980
I'm going to get better soon.

Mom, we should have the results back

11:22.536 --> 11:25.471
within an hour or two.

11:29.209 --> 11:33.513
Um, I don't understand.
You said her tests were normal.

11:33.547 --> 11:35.782
- They were, but...
- But she's getting worse.

11:35.816 --> 11:38.484
She can't move her legs at all anymore.

11:38.519 --> 11:40.920
We'll have a much clearer
picture once we receive

11:40.954 --> 11:43.423
the results back on
Denise's cerebrospinal fluid.

11:43.457 --> 11:46.359
And we'll ask the lab
to put a rush on these, okay?

11:46.393 --> 11:47.427
Thank you.

11:47.461 --> 11:49.929
- Yeah.
- Of course.

11:49.963 --> 11:53.132
Will, you saw that girl's CSF.
It was crystal clear.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.468
The lab's not gonna tell us
anything we don't already know.

11:55.502 --> 11:57.937
And it's obviously not
encephalitis, meningitis,

11:57.971 --> 11:59.138
- Guillain-Barre syndrome...
- Hold on then.

11:59.173 --> 12:01.007
Let's not rule out GBS.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.376
It fits her clinical
presentation almost to a T.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.111
I mean, normal blood work,

12:05.145 --> 12:08.448
ascending symmetrical

12:08.482 --> 12:10.516
Let's just do one more
round of labs first.

12:10.551 --> 12:13.386
Alright, test for heavy metal
poisoning, exotic infection,

12:13.420 --> 12:15.354
and if we don't get anything from those,

12:15.389 --> 12:18.024
I'm all for treating it as GBS, okay?

12:18.058 --> 12:20.460
Alright.

You're supposed to steer into the skid.

Why couldn't I remember that?

Goodness.

12:37.177 --> 12:38.878
Is he gonna be okay?

12:38.912 --> 12:41.147
Dislocated his hip, but other than that,

12:41.181 --> 12:42.982
just scrapes and bruises.

12:43.016 --> 12:45.418
We did a CT of his abdomen,
pelvis, and head.

All negative for internal
bleeds and fractures.

Yeah. Took him five tries.

No, the driver, they just
brought her in here.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.839
She was right over there.
She was bleeding real bad.

13:06.874 --> 13:08.341
- She's in surgery.
- Is she gonna be alright?

13:08.375 --> 13:11.010
I told Spencer the best
trauma surgeon in Chicago

13:11.044 --> 13:14.046
- is working on her.
- What if she doesn't make it?

13:14.081 --> 13:17.517
Don't worry, she... She'll make it.

14:01.086 --> 14:03.254
Yeah, I can't help that, Noah.

Well, if I could just tell
them that she's gonna be okay...

14:06.025 --> 14:07.592
No.

14:07.626 --> 14:10.328
Don't ever do that.

14:13.399 --> 14:15.667
Wait a minute, she won't
consent to being tested

14:15.701 --> 14:18.269
because she'd rather die
than have her family find out

14:18.304 --> 14:20.104
that she has AIDS.

14:20.139 --> 14:23.174
And you're saying she's capable
of making rational decisions?

14:23.208 --> 14:26.177
Just because you don't like
the decision she's making,

14:26.211 --> 14:28.413
doesn't mean
she's incapable of making it.

14:28.447 --> 14:31.349
Growing up in Africa, HIV-related stigma

14:31.383 --> 14:34.419

something she witnessed

- Vera.

14:44.463 --> 14:46.431
to tell her aunt, right?

She understands we have
strict privacy rules here.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.134
Doesn't matter.

14:50.169 --> 14:51.803
She's convinced that
if she takes the test,

14:51.837 --> 14:54.539
starts the antiretrovirals,
that they'll figure it out.

14:54.573 --> 14:56.607
But the lesions won't give her away.

let's say the toxo
is causing impairment,

15:26.872 --> 15:27.839
and we force the test.

But if it was off her by the

36:31.478 --> 36:33.646
how come the paralysis
kept moving up her body?

36:40.087 --> 36:42.488
Nope, but the paralysis
is mass-dependent,

as quickly up your body.
