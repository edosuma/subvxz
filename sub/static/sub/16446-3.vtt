<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
<i> Someone's escaped from Hell.</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:07.039
Who escaped Hell?
-<i> Mom.</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:08.271
If she's not coming to kill me,

00:08.275 --> 00:10.605
<i> then I don't know</i>
<i> what she's doing.</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:11.741
Aren't you glad
to see me?

00:11.746 --> 00:13.406
I apologize for
my human form.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.484
Chloe, I'm sorry.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.322
You don't get to be sorry.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.447
<i> I've been demoted.</i>

00:17.451 --> 00:18.881
<i> I'm reassigned</i>
<i> to assist on cases.</i>

00:18.886 --> 00:20.946
<i> I need to figure out</i>
<i> where I fit in in this world.</i>

00:20.955 --> 00:22.215
I need some space.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.223
<i> Things have been</i>
<i> very trying for me.</i>

00:24.225 --> 00:25.415
<i> Lucifer made a deal with</i>

00:25.426 --> 00:26.886
your ex to take
you back to Hell.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.394
<i> And he doesn't break deals.</i>

00:28.396 --> 00:30.096
I want what your father
took from me.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.327
All right, you can stay,

00:31.332 --> 00:34.002
just until I figure out
what I need to do.

00:38.973 --> 00:42.373
<i> I want to say I'm sorry...</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.406
<i> for all my sins.</i>

00:44.412 --> 00:48.452
For anything I have ever done
that hurt people.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.919
I was stupid.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.919
And I am sorry.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.122
I am so sorry.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.960
All I want now is forgiveness.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.365
I just want to take it all back.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.502
Please.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.111
No! Just let me take it back!

01:15.109 --> 01:18.439
No, no, no, no! No...!

01:26.420 --> 01:28.190
There's no need
for squeals.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.619
We'll stop this torture
any time you like.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.624
Just say the word.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.626
Don't you dare stop.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.927
What happens if he stops?

01:39.934 --> 01:41.704
Well, Lucifer,
don't be shy.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.042
Introduce me
to your friend.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.997
Lucifer,
you brought a surprise.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.165
I most certainly did not bring
any surprises.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.644
Oh, she's beautiful.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.712
That's my mum

01:49.710 --> 01:51.040
you're talking about.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.551
This just got too weird.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.517
Listen, Mum,
I know I chose

02:04.525 --> 02:07.025
not to return you to Hell,
yet...

02:07.027 --> 02:08.487
Which I appreciate.
But that doesn't mean

02:08.496 --> 02:11.726
you can just waltz in here
and accost my guests.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.522
I apologize.

02:13.516 --> 02:15.296
It's just that all
these human rules

02:15.302 --> 02:18.002
and customs are
so confusing.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.105
Remember, I'm still getting
used to this earthly skin sack.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.008
Yes, yes, you used
to be a goddess.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.880
I know, but things
are different now.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.249
And I will figure it out.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.407
Now that we're
together again,

02:28.415 --> 02:30.045
I just want to be
part of your lives.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.680
Not this part!

02:32.520 --> 02:34.390
Out of bounds.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.957
Wait. What do you
mean by "lives"?

02:40.027 --> 02:41.687
I want to see Amenadiel.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.955
What?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.934
It's time.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.533
I am not
going to live

02:48.536 --> 02:50.396
in fear of my own son.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.174
We may have had
our differences...

02:52.173 --> 02:54.113
He literally
carried you to Hell.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.438
But I created him.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.612
Certainly that has to
count for something.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.111
It doesn't. Bummer, right?

02:59.113 --> 03:00.283
One look at you,
and he'll take you

03:00.281 --> 03:01.481
right back where you came from.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.582
I'm surprised he hasn't
come sniffing around already.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.245
Well, what am I supposed to do,
just sit here and hide?

03:07.254 --> 03:09.394
See a movie, go to a museum.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.190
Catch up on what's happened over
the past few thousand years.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.933
You'd be surprised.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.128
Yes. I suppose
a lot has changed.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.559
I mean, who would've predicted
you would've

03:16.564 --> 03:18.334
taken on this human job?

03:18.332 --> 03:21.102
I'm a punisher, Mother.
It's what I've always done.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.471
The only thing that changed
was the locale.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.378
I know what you're thinking,

03:32.379 --> 03:34.549
but I was assisting on a
stakeout that went long,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.918
and I'm really sorry,
but I promise you,

03:36.917 --> 03:38.677
I will make it
up to you, okay?

03:38.686 --> 03:41.216
How?

03:42.656 --> 03:46.286
Double fudge, your favorite.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.162
You're lucky I like you.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.631
Hey.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.836
Hey.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.967
Thank you for letting me
do the pickup here at work.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.743
I've just been running around
a lot since the demotion.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.182
You know, helping out

04:03.177 --> 04:04.337
on everyone else's cases.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.245
Yeah. It's fine, it's fine.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.677
Are we still going
on our family camping trip?

04:08.682 --> 04:11.232
Oh, uh...

04:11.234 --> 04:13.794
We're still ler... working
out the logistics of that.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.787
Of the trip.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.992
Look, I know that
you're still mad at me.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.825
I deserve it.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.160
But this stuff between us is
starting to affect Trixie.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.666
So I think that we
need to talk later.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.601
Yeah, yeah. We should.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.666
You're right.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.914
Uh, Decker.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.608
Okay, yeah.
Two seconds.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.880
<i> I was stupid.</i>

04:42.883 --> 04:44.653
And I'm sorry.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.824
Victim's name was
Nicholas Sands, 35.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.022
Worked as an exec at the
Internet startup called Wobble.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.756
Wobble?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.931
Please tell me that's
a pornography site.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.999
Oh, no, no. Wobble's like
a next gen Facebook, you know?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
People post updates,
photos, links.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.071
Mine's mostly slo-mo videos
of me doing cannonballs

05:03.070 --> 05:04.070
onto inflatable pool toys.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.441
You should check it out.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.710
I'll pass, but thank you.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.639
Nick's confession was posted
to his Wobble account

05:10.644 --> 05:12.044
six hours ago,
right around the time of death.

05:12.046 --> 05:15.906
Which means whoever did this
wanted us to find that video.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.816
So we could see how weepy
this chap was before he died.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.619
Now, that is cruel.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.161
Ella, do we know
how the fire started?

05:23.157 --> 05:24.717
Any chemicals
we can trace?

05:24.725 --> 05:27.385
So far, all we've got
is paraffin oil.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.264
Which is highly flammable,
but also, like, everywhere.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.274
Even in crayons, so
color at your own risk.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.367
Doesn't help us
narrow the suspects.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.599
Yeah, but this might.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.303
Okay, so based
on the burn pattern,

05:38.305 --> 05:40.465
which is pretty gnarly
in this case,

05:40.474 --> 05:43.014
it looks like the highest
concentration of accelerant

05:43.010 --> 05:44.680
was placed, well...

05:44.678 --> 05:46.138
here.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.623
Goodness gracious,

05:51.618 --> 05:52.648
great balls of fire.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.153
Lucifer.
I mean, I've heard
of hot pants,

05:54.154 --> 05:55.494
but this really
brings new meaning

05:55.489 --> 05:57.359
to the term "fire
crotch," doesn't it?
Lucifer.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.658
Wait. I have more.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.689
Smokey Bobinson.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.993
Weekend at Burnie's.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.034
His burning bush?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.199
Oh. Very good.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.198
That was actually me,
by the way,

06:06.200 --> 06:07.830
so don't tell anyone.
- Hey, guys?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.125
Dead body.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.796
Can you please
take this seriously?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.714
I assure you, Detective,
I'm taking this very seriously.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.767
Look at this.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.435
Our killer was clearly
punishing his victim.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.106
And?

06:20.114 --> 06:22.114
And punishing is my job.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.416
So if there's
someone out there

06:23.417 --> 06:25.577
stealing my jam,
I need to find out who.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.624
It's game bloody on.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:40.401 --> 06:43.401
Do not touch
the charred crotch.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.108
Is a sentence I never
thought I'd say out loud.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.267
It's vicious work.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.076
I mean, I reserve
this kind of treatment

06:51.078 --> 06:53.408
for the truly terrible
in Hell.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.084
Pedophiles, Nazis.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.082
People who put their
seats back on a plane.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.754
Uh-huh. Seeing as the nature
of the crime is so specific,

07:00.754 --> 07:03.294
we need to figure out
who had a personal grudge

07:03.290 --> 07:06.390
against the victim.
Hmm.

07:06.393 --> 07:10.833
Uh, by the way, you've
skipped a spot, there.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.331
Oh.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.632
Yeah, it's not like you

07:13.634 --> 07:16.104
to miss a step in the
clothing department.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.543
Yes, well, I had to rush out
this morning.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.368
I've got an unexpected
houseguest I can't get rid of.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.843
Oh, right. New lady friend
that you can't shake.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.582
A rather old one,
actually.

07:23.577 --> 07:28.707
Yeah, I know how...
complicated exes can be.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.245
What? She's not an ex.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.020
You should see this,
Detective.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.449
Thanks.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.594
What is it?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.358
E-mails from Nick's
supervisor at Wobble.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.287
A woman by the name
of Leila Simms.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.393
Let me guess,
something riveting

07:40.394 --> 07:42.094
about the latest
quarterly report?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.085
"How could you?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.556
"I should have
known better.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.255
You won't get
away with this."

07:46.266 --> 07:48.726
"I'll burn you
starting with your man parts"?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.640
No.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.108
Still, that's a pretty
good lead.
Yep.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.154
Do not... touch...

08:00.147 --> 08:02.347
the charred crotch.

08:05.018 --> 08:09.088
And Nick was so...
sweet and charming.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.619
How could someone do
such a thing?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.824
So, Leila, you were
his supervisor.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.786
How well did you
know him?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.125
We dated briefly,
a while ago.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.329
Oh.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.374
Would you say
things sort of flamed out,

08:22.369 --> 08:23.939
or did they end in more of

08:23.937 --> 08:25.167
a blaze of glory?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.772
Lucifer.
You're right, far too subtle.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.943
Why did you torture
the poor young man to death?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.182
Torture him?

08:31.979 --> 08:34.009
Oh, God.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.014
You think I had
something to do with this?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.645
Well, we know about
the angry e-mails.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.051
I was pissed off.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.652
He shared pictures
of us together.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.115
Mm, mid-coitus?

08:43.121 --> 08:44.592
If so, we'll have to
confiscate those immediately.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.961
No.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.029
Just of us

08:47.027 --> 08:48.057
at-at dinner.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.561
But I'm his boss,

08:49.563 --> 08:51.233
and inter-office romance
is frowned upon here.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.461
Well, it hardly
seems worthy

08:52.466 --> 08:55.126
of lighting a man's
johnson on fire.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.270
Wait.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.142
Is that how he died?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.738
There's something
you should see.

09:07.330 --> 09:08.810
Ray, can you come in here,
please?

09:08.815 --> 09:12.145
Ray, I'm gonna need you
to pull up the video

09:12.152 --> 09:14.292
of Tommy at the
company retreat.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.818
<i> The</i> video of Tommy?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.362
Ray's head of our H.R.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.117
Being protective is
part of his job.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.686
Do it, Ray.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.199
Nick was a charmer,
but he had a tendency

09:25.198 --> 09:27.168
to be a little harsh
with interns.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.467
Aka, he could be a real dick.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.374
As you'll see.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.284
Aah! Aah!

09:39.279 --> 09:41.209
My balls! Get it off!

09:46.887 --> 09:48.647
Come on,
that is quite funny.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.555
Nick posted the video
shortly after the retreat,

09:50.557 --> 09:52.987
and even though
it was quickly taken down,

09:52.993 --> 09:54.163
everyone saw it.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.031
Tommy was a
laughingstock.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.430
He quit pretty soon after.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.472
Certainly looks like motive.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.109
Huh.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.566
What can you tell me
about Nick Sand's death?

10:08.575 --> 10:11.005
Just that the bastard
finally got what he deserved.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.681
Okay. And why did
he deserve it?

10:13.680 --> 10:16.180
As soon as I took
the job at Wobble,

10:16.183 --> 10:18.083
Nick made it
his personal mission

10:18.085 --> 10:20.045
to make my life hell.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.353
Sabotaging my work,
terrorizing me,

10:22.356 --> 10:24.516
making me the butt
of all of his jokes.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.864
Or the <i> balls,</i> in this case?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.385
That stupid video was

10:29.396 --> 10:31.356
my breaking point.

10:31.365 --> 10:34.265
Everyone saw it.
Everyone laughed at me!

10:34.267 --> 10:36.167
No one's laughing now, Tommy.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.769
So after everything
that happened, what,

10:38.772 --> 10:41.412
you-you wanted to
make him feel your pain?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.438
He deserved
what happened to him.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.883
Yeah, but you're not
answering the question.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.824
Did you kill Nick?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.677
I understand
punishment all too well, Tommy,

10:52.686 --> 10:56.286
and Nick deserved
to be punished.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.959
He did, didn't he?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.158
Mm. He took your
dignity, and so you had to

11:00.160 --> 11:01.490
take your revenge.

11:01.495 --> 11:05.025
There was no other way to get
your proverbial balls back.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.562
So tell me...

11:08.168 --> 11:09.728
...did you desire...

11:09.736 --> 11:11.036
I killed him.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.268
Oh.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.813
Well, that took

11:14.808 --> 11:17.278
all the fun out of it.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.779
That did not go how I expected.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.421
Oh, come now, Detective.
He obviously wanted people

11:23.417 --> 11:24.947
to know that he got
his revenge.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.151
Now our would-be punisher's
brought to justice,

11:27.154 --> 11:30.464
and the field is mine again...

11:30.457 --> 11:33.187
What on earth is she doing here?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.693
Charlotte Richards.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.755
The defense attorney
we saved, remember?

11:36.763 --> 11:39.503
She must be back here
defending some scumbag.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.599
But why are they
all being so... chummy?

11:42.602 --> 11:45.472
Well, she used to be
a cop, and, oh, yeah,

11:45.472 --> 11:47.142
'cause she's a knockout.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.470
Personally, I'm surprised
that you haven't tried...

11:49.476 --> 11:51.606
Pardon me, pardon me.
Excuse us.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.951
Charlotte, hello. Do you mind
if we have a quick word?

11:56.817 --> 11:59.617
What are you
doing here, Mother?

11:59.619 --> 12:01.149
I thought we agreed
you'd do something constructive

12:01.154 --> 12:03.824
with your time, like
mall walking or a studio tour,

12:03.824 --> 12:05.224
perhaps, but...

12:05.225 --> 12:07.085
How did you even find
your way here?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.664
Well, it wasn't difficult.

12:08.662 --> 12:12.262
I simply smiled at a male human
and asked him to take me.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.725
Need I remind you that Charlotte
Richards has a husband out there

12:14.735 --> 12:16.695
who's wondering
where she popped off to.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.903
And you have a son who wants
to take you back to Hell.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.935
So drawing attention
to yourself in a police station

12:20.941 --> 12:24.541
in this little... getup,
not a good idea.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.684
But I had to see
it for myself.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.180
My boy, working,
toiling,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.922
amidst humanity's muck.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.817
Well, I hope it's everything
you imagined and more.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.519
Now go see <i> Cabaret.</i> I'm sure
you'll find it riveting.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.792
I just don't understand.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.320
Of all the things that
you could do with your talents,

12:39.326 --> 12:41.186
law enforcement?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.564
Have you considered I might
enjoy exploring humanity?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.995
They eat, darling.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.130
All they do is eat.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.595
And then afterwards,
the food comes out changed

12:50.604 --> 12:53.614
and not for the better.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.878
Detective.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.141
I didn't realize

12:59.146 --> 13:01.006
you and Charlotte knew
each other so well.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.554
Oh, we do and we don't.
It's a long story, really.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.421
Right, shall we
go somewhere

13:06.419 --> 13:08.049
to, uh, celebrate
solving the case?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.894
No. Not yet.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.690
Tommy was humiliated.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.491
Makes sense
why he'd want to kill Nick.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.163
But something
just doesn't sit right.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.862
Detective, you, of all people,
should know how good it feels

13:17.864 --> 13:19.704
to punish someone
who's wronged you.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.099
How so?
Oh, come now.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.101
You may not be roasting
Dan's chestnuts-- yet--

13:24.104 --> 13:26.704
but a shoulder shrug here,
a dismissive look there

13:26.706 --> 13:28.436
could be just as effective.
Okay, fine.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.881
Maybe I've been a little hard on
Dan lately, but he deserves it.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.477
And I'm sure
you found it very satisfying.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.479
But have you considered

13:33.480 --> 13:34.780
for just one moment

13:34.781 --> 13:38.521
how your fighting affects
those caught in the middle?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.118
You mean Trixie?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.720
What? No, I mean me.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.521
Think how terribly
bored I am by it all.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.023
Ah, look, there he is.
Now's your chance

13:46.026 --> 13:48.586
to stop with your "will they,
won't they" nonsense.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.585
It's not that simple.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.796
I'm avoiding
a difficult conversation.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.857
Well, I...

13:51.865 --> 13:53.795
Hi.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.230
There's something
you got to see.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.465
Another apology video dropped
along with another body.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.600
I know it was wrong!

13:59.606 --> 14:02.806
I shouldn't have posted
that video!

14:02.809 --> 14:05.539
She didn't deserve
to be humiliated like that.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.205
I'm sorry.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.073
Two murders.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.925
Same M.O.

14:36.926 --> 14:38.776
But Tommy was already in custody
when this guy was killed.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.508
There's no way
he did this.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.283
Tommy wanted
his dignity back.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.682
Whoever did this

14:43.683 --> 14:46.453
clearly had a much grander
objective in mind.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.793
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:47.787 --> 14:49.847
it looks like we're
tracking a serial killer.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.534
Victim's Adam Wiser, 29,

14:56.529 --> 14:58.599
worked as an assistant
at a local bank.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.268
Time of death was two hours ago,
but apparently he's been missing

15:01.268 --> 15:02.498
for almost two days.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.642
Ooh, that's a long time
on a sex rack.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.208
Not a record,
but quite impressive.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.737
Ella, we know
the cause of death?

15:08.742 --> 15:10.812
Well, he's got broken ribs,
a ruptured spleen

15:10.810 --> 15:14.480
and possible cranial bleeding,
which would all totally suck.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.411
And yet, this dude asphyxiated.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.946
He was choked
with an apple?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.522
No.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.490
More like an orchard.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.490
We're gonna have to cut
him open to get the rest.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.762
That's messed up.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.490
Certainly brings new meaning
to the term "deep throat."

15:29.496 --> 15:30.896
Why not just
kill the guy?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.897
Why all the pomp
and circumstance?

15:32.899 --> 15:35.499
Well, our punisher's
clearly sending a message.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.042
Perhaps if we find the
video that Apple Boy

15:37.037 --> 15:40.137
is apologizing for,
we'll know what that message is.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.170
Hold this.
What are you doing?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.035
The original video was filmed
on Nick's phone, right?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.344
What if Adam's doing
the same thing?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.894
Be careful, Detective.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.262
Might be a booby trap.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.973
The video's already cued up.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.910
Look at this.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.646
Notice anything familiar?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.415
The ball gag's
amaranth.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.723
Just like the apple.

16:32.726 --> 16:35.126
What, so our killer's paying
homage to a bloody sex tape?

16:35.128 --> 16:37.728
He's recreating the crimes
he's punishing for.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.561
First lighting Nick's
groin on fire, now this.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.696
He's upping his game.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.900
Yeah, but what's
with the outfit?

16:41.901 --> 16:44.001
I mean, other than giving me
super creepy flashbacks

16:44.004 --> 16:46.704
to Catholic school,
it doesn't add up.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.906
And the woman is not
wearing one in the video.

16:48.908 --> 16:52.308
She certainly looks too old
to be in school.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.782
Unless she
teaches at one.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.348
Her name's
Sarah Aiken, 27.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.355
Third grade teacher.
Cute.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.027
Not hot, but extra points
for proclivities.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.587
When she broke things
off with Adam,

17:08.595 --> 17:10.994
he uploaded his
revenge porn to Wobble.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.926
Some teachers caught wind
of it, and she was fired.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.772
Well, maybe she took out both
Nick and our loathsome ex.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.200
You know, no harm, no foul.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.273
And no dice because she had
no connection to Nick.
Oh.

17:21.273 --> 17:24.743
And shortly after she lost
her job, she killed herself.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.784
What, so our poor,
sexy teacher's dead,

17:27.781 --> 17:29.881
and our apple-chomping
schoolboy's responsible?

17:29.883 --> 17:32.053
And the only other connection
we were able to find

17:32.052 --> 17:34.922
is that both victims posted
their illicit videos to Wobble.

17:34.921 --> 17:38.021
So, maybe some sicko
saw both videos

17:38.024 --> 17:40.224
and decided to take action.
"Sicko"?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.886
Sounds to me like someone's
doing our job for us.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.496
We don't exact
vengeance, Lucifer.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.098
Well, maybe we should.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.700
As far as I'm concerned,

17:48.701 --> 17:50.301
these little wankers
got exactly what they deserved.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.373
See you later.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.201
Hey, where are you going?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.636
We have to find out
who did this.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.841
Well, I thought
someone out there

17:55.842 --> 17:57.812
was stealing my job,
but far be it for me

17:57.811 --> 17:59.981
to stand in the way
of excellent work.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.379
I'm off for a drink.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.216
No.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.661
Honestly, I'm impressed.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.257
It's hard going out on your own.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.989
Changing old habits.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.725
I admire the steps
you're taking.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.660
Well, don't
admire too much.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.526
I'm still coming to Lux.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.474
Hmm, yes.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.140
Baby steps are fine.

18:25.138 --> 18:28.238
Plus, the view here is... nice.

18:30.343 --> 18:34.483
The real key
is to avoid setbacks.

18:36.249 --> 18:40.589
Setbacks that are tall,
blond and have a special place

18:40.587 --> 18:41.887
in Hell?
Mm.

18:41.888 --> 18:42.888
Hi, Maze.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.017
Hi, human.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.962
I need to get rid
of that bitch.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.764
Now I know
why you're still here.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.226
Why?

18:56.236 --> 18:59.066
You and Lucifer are very close.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.806
It's normal that you be
jealous of a new girlfriend.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.840
I'm not jealous.
Ah. Mm-hmm.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.245
And she's not his girlfriend.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.248
She's just toxic.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.320
Lucifer doesn't
see it, but I do.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.688
Oh, so you want
to protect him?

19:14.687 --> 19:17.257
I want her to get
what she deserves.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.857
Which, at the very
least, is a head-butt.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.089
I'll be right back.

19:21.094 --> 19:21.894
Okay, okay.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.995
Okay, maybe...

19:23.997 --> 19:25.997
we should start
with our words.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.599
Perhaps as Lucifer's friend,
you can talk to him.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.141
Express how you feel.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.837
He won't listen.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.667
But maybe someone else will.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.011
Where are you going?

19:39.012 --> 19:40.652
Taking your advice.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.347
Hey, Man Bun.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.678
Take care of my friend.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.753
Why do I even try?

19:48.755 --> 19:51.415
Because you're
an incredible woman.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.224
Oh.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.726
Thanks.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.462
So, I reached out to Wobble
to cross-reference who saw

19:59.465 --> 20:01.165
both Nick and Adam's videos.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.167
And?
They lawyered up.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.439
Hid behind privacy laws,
and without a warrant,

20:05.438 --> 20:08.038
Wobble won't let us anywhere
near their viewership data.

20:08.041 --> 20:12.281
Okay, pull the warrant,
and I'm on my way there.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.448
No problem.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.178
Dan.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.323
Um...

20:18.318 --> 20:20.318
So I've been thinking
about the trip,

20:20.320 --> 20:21.920
and, um...

20:21.921 --> 20:24.191
I don't think it's
fair to put Trixie

20:24.190 --> 20:26.790
in the middle of our
problems, you know?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.933
So you want to skip it.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.598
No, I want to spare us
all heartache and...

20:31.598 --> 20:33.928
I just feel like if
we go on the trip

20:33.933 --> 20:35.933
and, you know, we pretend
everything's fine,

20:35.935 --> 20:38.135
then we're just lying to her.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.937
Yeah.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.470
All right.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.112
Excuse me.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.167
Excuse me. Mom.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.514
Oh.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.838
What do you think
you're doing?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.114
I'm taking your lead, son.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.312
Learning about
your beloved humanity.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.313
By dancing at my club?

21:22.315 --> 21:23.915
Well, I saw all the people

21:23.916 --> 21:25.516
on the tables smiling
and I wanted to discover

21:25.518 --> 21:26.978
what they were so happy about.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.516
Oh, is it possible it's
the money that I pay them?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.163
It's possible.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.858
But I have to admit
that when I started dancing,

21:34.861 --> 21:38.401
rubbing up against
the other humans,

21:38.398 --> 21:39.498
I got a tingling
sensation...

21:39.499 --> 21:40.999
Okay, that's enough.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.400
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.373
I don't understand.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.000
I thought you'd be
pleased by my effort.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.005
Disturbed is more like it.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.807
Are you actually trying
to systematically disrupt

21:50.810 --> 21:52.540
every part of my life?
No.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.275
I'm trying to <i> learn</i> about
every part of your life.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.551
Oh, right.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.019
How's that going for you so far?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.147
Well, quite
illuminating, actually.

22:00.153 --> 22:04.163
I understand now why you
have this provocative club.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.917
I understand why
you amused yourself

22:05.925 --> 22:07.925
with that
curvaceous savage.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.787
But what I don't
understand...

22:09.796 --> 22:11.156
Is my human job. Yes, I know.

22:11.164 --> 22:14.204
It's very simple:
I'm a civilian consultant.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.930
But why do you
still punish people?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.766
It's what I've always done.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.041
That's not true.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.709
That's who your father
wanted you to be.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.683
Are you still trying
to win him over?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.449
Careful, Mother.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.248
Why?

22:29.248 --> 22:31.418
Are you going
to punish me?

22:47.100 --> 22:48.200
I'm sorry, Detective.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.601
I looked into
the two videos in question,

22:50.603 --> 22:52.273
and unfortunately,
there was no overlap.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.941
Doesn't make any sense.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.010
I'll need a list of everyone
who saw the videos.

22:56.008 --> 22:59.208
Sadly, we don't track people,
just I.P. addresses.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.382
Maybe I'm looking
at this the wrong way.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.222
Can you take me through how
your video process works?

23:05.218 --> 23:07.948
Well, our users can upload
anything they want.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.954
And if we find that
the content's inappropriate--

23:09.956 --> 23:13.216
uh, anything from
animal cruelty to beheadings--

23:13.226 --> 23:14.686
it gets taken down.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.164
By who?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.562
Our content moderators.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.833
Huh.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.701
Most of them
only last a few months.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.900
Frankly, most people

23:21.901 --> 23:24.001
can't stomach something
so dark or upsetting.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.643
Right.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.168
God, that has got to smart.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.476
Can I see that again?

23:32.478 --> 23:34.038
Lucifer?

23:34.046 --> 23:35.976
Oh, Detective.
You're here.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.622
Did you know that this room

23:37.617 --> 23:39.247
collects all the best parts
of the Internet?

23:39.252 --> 23:41.122
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, yeah.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.020
But you got to see this--
a-a naked man

23:43.022 --> 23:45.022
thinks he can jump
on the back of a rhino.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.324
You'll never
guess what he lands on.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.556
Actually, you probably will.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.332
What? You've seen it already?

23:55.401 --> 23:56.601
What are you doing here?

23:56.602 --> 23:57.902
Trying to catch our killer.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.804
Duh.
I thought you
didn't care

23:59.806 --> 24:02.006
whether this sicko
was brought to justice.
Oh, I don't.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.778
But then I realized that
our killer may have the answer

24:04.777 --> 24:07.207
to a question that I'm,
you know, struggling with.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.253
Mm.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.677
Why does he punish?

24:09.682 --> 24:10.882
That's it?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.183
First you want to teach
this vigilante a lesson,

24:13.186 --> 24:15.286
and now you want to
have a talk with him?
Yes.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.318
And lucky for me, I found out
where you were headed.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.793
I mean, these videos
are enthralling.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.162
No, I-I can't.
I can't watch these.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.760
Oh, I've seen worse.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.962
But never so many collected
in one single room.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.064
You know, if I ever
go back to Hell,

24:27.066 --> 24:29.066
I am getting me
one of these.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.068
Selfish bastards
get to see everything.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.273
Yeah.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.883
They do.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.878
I know where
the overlap is.

25:18.784 --> 25:21.754
Amenadiel,
I know you're in there.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.020
Open up!

25:32.031 --> 25:33.861
Hey.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.037
What are you hiding?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.709
Nothing.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.881
Oh.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.917
I see what's going on with you.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.424
You do?
Sure.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.323
Humans say that rebound sex
is important after a breakup.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.456
You don't have to hide
that you're getting some.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.364
I'm not.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.531
Right.

26:10.536 --> 26:13.236
Of course. I didn't want you
to feel awkward.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.039
Silly me.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.749
So what are
you doing here?

26:21.747 --> 26:25.477
I have a problem.

26:25.484 --> 26:26.624
I need your help.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.089
There's a new...

26:29.088 --> 26:31.558
woman in Lucifer's life.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.287
I want her gone,
but he won't listen to me.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.663
And why do you care?
I thought you were

26:36.662 --> 26:38.362
stepping away
from both of us.

26:41.467 --> 26:42.647
I am.

26:42.651 --> 26:43.831
But before I do,
I need you...
I'll talk to him.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.236
Yeah.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.707
Well, that was easy.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.610
I'm his big brother, Maze.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.511
I really should start looking
out for him more often.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.519
Okay.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.247
Thank you.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.491
All right. Thanks.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.089
Dan's working with
Wobble to trace

27:05.091 --> 27:06.821
what moderator may have
pulled both videos.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.026
Hopefully, we'll
have an answer soon.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.727
Then why are you
so sure the killer's

27:09.729 --> 27:11.059
one of these misanthropes?

27:11.063 --> 27:12.533
Well, serial killers

27:12.531 --> 27:14.061
usually start with
someone they know.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.866
If the killer worked
here, they knew Nick,

27:15.868 --> 27:18.068
saw how much the
prank hurt Tommy.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.370
So you think
seeing someone they recognized

27:19.372 --> 27:22.212
in one of these twisted videos
finally made them snap?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.508
Maybe it awakened
something in them.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.880
Something that was always there,
just fighting to get out.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.750
But...

27:30.750 --> 27:33.680
they were just
trying to do a job.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.216
Job no one else wanted.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.221
Well, maybe they chose
that for a reason.

27:37.223 --> 27:40.563
No one chooses
to be a sin-eater, Detective.

27:40.559 --> 27:43.629
No one wants
to be custodian

27:43.629 --> 27:46.499
of the world's filth.
Why would they?

27:46.499 --> 27:49.869
Absorbing the worst humanity has
to offer, day in and day out.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.369
Changes you.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.040
So you think
it's the job's fault

27:53.039 --> 27:54.169
that they started to punish?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.373
People don't
arrive broken.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.384
They start with passion
and yearning

27:58.377 --> 28:02.247
till something comes along that
disabuses them of those notions.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.048
Hmm.

28:05.051 --> 28:08.651
Which means... that none
of these people did it.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.894
Okay. I'm not following.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.389
Well, look at Tim there,

28:11.390 --> 28:14.460
with the photos
of his ugly children.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.660
Ivan and his flowerpots.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.762
Poor Andrea's still hoping
Destiny's Child

28:18.764 --> 28:20.064
get back together.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.066
Don't you see?

28:21.067 --> 28:23.967
These people still have hope.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.341
Excuse me.
Yeah.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.009
Who's had this
job the longest?
Um...

28:30.009 --> 28:31.209
maybe me.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.910
I've been at it
two whole months.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.612
Huh.
Oh. Anyone else?

28:34.613 --> 28:35.813
No.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.445
Other than Leila, of course.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.920
Leila, your boss?
Yeah. She started
as a moderator

28:39.919 --> 28:41.919
before the company blew up.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.691
She was the first of us.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.689
Thanks.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.191
Leila knew Nick, she had
access to the videos.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.564
If she's behind this...

28:49.562 --> 28:53.232
She's known what we've been
doing every step of the way.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.102
Dan, I need you to see if
you can trace the videos

28:56.102 --> 28:58.702
to one person in
particular now.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.514
We're looking
at Leila Simms.

29:05.978 --> 29:09.008
I can't believe we had the
killer right under our nose.

29:09.014 --> 29:12.184
And she's gone.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.694
TouchÃ©, Leila. TouchÃ©.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.655
Luci?

29:25.664 --> 29:28.574
Luci, you home?

29:32.938 --> 29:36.108
He's not here.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.978
He left in quite
the hurry before.

29:37.977 --> 29:42.007
Think it was
something I said.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.082
I'm sorry.
Are you his latest, uh...?

29:46.085 --> 29:49.415
Trust me,
I'm not his latest anything.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.161
All right.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.157
So, what <i> are</i> you
doing here, then?

29:53.159 --> 29:54.989
I'm having a bit of

29:54.994 --> 29:57.964
an existential crisis,
I suppose.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.733
I've been known
to be a good listener.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.903
Okay.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.502
Uh...

30:04.503 --> 30:06.703
I'm having some trouble
with my kids.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.965
Needed to get away from them
for a little bit?

30:08.974 --> 30:11.484
No, the opposite, actually.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.237
I'm trying
to get closer to them,

30:13.245 --> 30:15.605
but I'm not having much luck.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.479
Tell me.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.346
Are you a good son?

30:22.354 --> 30:25.464
I try to be.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.357
Well, then perhaps
you can explain.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.330
Would a good son

30:30.329 --> 30:34.459
blindly take his father's side
in a divorce?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.471
Would a good son

30:37.469 --> 30:39.869
send his mother to Hell?

30:39.872 --> 30:42.942
And would a good son

30:42.942 --> 30:46.142
stand here right before me,

30:46.145 --> 30:50.375
without a care in the world,
plotting to send me back?

30:53.552 --> 30:54.692
Mom?

30:54.687 --> 31:00.317
I thought I would come to Earth
to be with my sons.

31:00.326 --> 31:04.286
Instead, Lucifer is obsessed
with his human job,

31:04.296 --> 31:05.996
and you're still
your father's loyal soldier.

31:05.998 --> 31:10.368
I'm tired of fighting for things
that I'm never gonna have.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.769
So just take me back, Amenadiel.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.772
I'm ready.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.252
No matter what happens,

31:25.251 --> 31:29.551
I will <i> always...</i> love you.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.145
Always.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.333
Leila took down
both videos,

31:36.328 --> 31:38.058
killed Nick and Adam,
and then led us

31:38.063 --> 31:40.033
by the nose until she
had time to escape.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.472
Why didn't I
realize it was her?

31:41.467 --> 31:43.467
Because as a punisher,
she's quite adept

31:43.469 --> 31:44.999
at avoiding
her own medicine.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.704
Quite impressed, really.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.482
Hey, Dan.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.877
Yeah, I just saw it.
I'm already working on a trace.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.209
"Judgment Day"? Oh.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.484
People should really be careful
how they use that phrase.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.223
It isn't actually due
for another couple of years.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.119
She's gonna kill herself
live on the air.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.761
What?
Well, that won't do at all.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.157
How am I supposed
to talk to her if she's dead?

32:07.159 --> 32:08.959
Glad you have
your priorities in order.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.401
Thought we were dealing with
someone smart and clever,

32:11.397 --> 32:12.757
who tortured with
a brutal sense of irony,

32:12.765 --> 32:14.125
but killing herself

32:14.133 --> 32:15.833
whilst humiliating
her company...

32:15.834 --> 32:17.674
Doesn't fit the pattern.

32:17.670 --> 32:21.140
Hey, Sharon, can you pull up the
video of Leila driving again?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.340
Yeah. Sure.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.280
Pause it there.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.578
What are you
looking for, Detective?

32:27.579 --> 32:28.579
Zoom in

32:28.580 --> 32:30.150
to the edge of the seat.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.679
Can you go in tighter?

32:36.855 --> 32:38.785
Well, I know
images can be deceiving,

32:38.791 --> 32:41.331
but that looks an awful lot
like a gun, doesn't it?

32:41.327 --> 32:43.787
Leila's not our killer.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.696
She's in danger.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.198
You understand this
sicko pretty well.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.729
Where do you
think he's going?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.944
Well, somewhere linked
to her sins, I suppose.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.237
We barely know Leila.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.008
Who knows what the killer
thinks she's done?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.367
Well, she runs
the company that hosts

32:56.375 --> 32:59.035
humanity's worst depravities,
but we know she's not there.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.484
Hey, Dan,
how's the trace coming?

33:00.479 --> 33:02.309
The I.P. just keeps pinging
back to Wobble's main server.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.514
It's got to be
a mistake.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.617
Unless it's not
a mistake at all.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.061
You know, if you take
away the blinky lights

33:18.063 --> 33:19.563
and add some lost souls,

33:19.565 --> 33:22.165
this place bares a striking
resemblance to Hell.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.997
Shh. Listen.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.544
My name is... Leila Simms.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.712
I'm one of
the co-founders of Wobble.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.112
I wanted to apologize
to anybody who's watching

33:37.116 --> 33:40.176
for... for creating a forum...

33:42.054 --> 33:45.064
...where evil and hate
sought a refuge.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.087
And there's
Queen Wobble herself.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.193
Yeah, but where's
the killer?

33:50.195 --> 33:52.825
And tonight I go down
with the ship.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.673
Right alongside
all of those awful sins

33:56.668 --> 34:00.668
that-that I helped
give a voice to.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.172
Please, please.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.335
P-Please, please.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.984
D-Don't make me do this.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.810
Please.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.623
There's Ray, the HR rep.

34:16.621 --> 34:20.262
Oh, goodness me,
I should have known.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.359
Halitosis--
first sign of evil.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.731
He had all the access
he needed

34:23.728 --> 34:26.559
to find his targets
and frame Leila.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.539
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.271
If he drops that lighter,
he'll kill her.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.636
I don't have a shot.

34:51.824 --> 34:54.293
Okay, Detective, this next
part will be much easier

34:54.293 --> 34:57.063
if you're not here, so I'm gonna
politely ask you to leave, okay?

34:57.062 --> 34:58.632
I'm not going anywhere.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.200
We're gonna figure this out.
Just give me a second.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.304
All right, no rush.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.836
Whilst you're pondering,
I'm gonna go and have a word

35:09.842 --> 35:11.072
with our killer.

35:11.076 --> 35:12.336
That's a great idea.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.312
Sorry, say that again.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.475
I never meant to cause anybody
any pain.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.852
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

35:22.855 --> 35:25.115
Yeah.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.664
Hello, Raymond.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.959
Hate to, uh,
blow up your spot,

35:29.962 --> 35:31.862
but I have a question
to ask you before you complete

35:31.864 --> 35:33.464
this twisted little
mise-en-scene.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.755
Stay back.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.196
I swear I will drop this,
and she is dead.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.602
Oh, gosh,
there's the halitosis.

35:38.604 --> 35:39.944
It travels, doesn't it?

35:39.938 --> 35:42.208
You should really get that
looked at, but first,

35:42.207 --> 35:46.207
indulge me this one
simple query.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.441
Why?

35:50.649 --> 35:51.579
What?

35:51.583 --> 35:54.583
Why are you a punisher?

35:54.586 --> 35:56.546
I understand
the longing for justice

35:56.555 --> 35:59.585
or the joy
of sweet revenge,

35:59.591 --> 36:01.691
but no one's forcing you
to do this,

36:01.693 --> 36:04.663
so why would you
take it upon yourself?

36:06.732 --> 36:09.072
Because I couldn't
take it anymore.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.627
All that evil

36:10.636 --> 36:12.036
is constantly spreading.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.497
I had to do something.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.040
I had to punish them.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.842
You're wrong.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.605
You didn't have
to do anything.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.213
You <i> wanted</i> to punish them.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.705
No, that's not true.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.916
Yes, it started with Nick--
that was impulsive.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.849
But then you got
a taste for blood,

36:28.854 --> 36:30.594
and it felt good, didn't it?

36:30.589 --> 36:31.959
I was doing my part.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.117
You had big plans

36:33.125 --> 36:34.415
to go on vengeance quest

36:34.425 --> 36:35.715
until we came
nipping at your heels,

36:35.727 --> 36:38.327
at which point
poor Leila took the fall.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.630
An innocent!
No, you're wrong.

36:39.631 --> 36:40.961
And then what,
you'd stop?

36:40.966 --> 36:43.396
Get away scot-free?

36:45.637 --> 36:49.407
We both know you can't stop
because you love it!

36:49.408 --> 36:51.538
Just like the people
you punished.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.113
I don't! I...

36:57.749 --> 36:59.579
I do.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.260
I-I like seeing them
beg for forgiveness.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.118
You see, the difference
between us

37:08.126 --> 37:11.286
is that you became
part of the problem, Ray.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.056
Someone deserving
punishment.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.665
You're right.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.438
I do.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.541
We all do.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.084
No, wait!

37:45.364 --> 37:48.904
Man, you really don't shut up.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.800
Congratulations, Detective.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.602
I suppose you could say
I look quite extinguished.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.439
Right.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.540
Shall we get you untied?

38:00.512 --> 38:03.312
Burning the midnight oil?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.775
Ha, ha, what can I say?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.924
Being everybody's
bitch really sucks.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.949
Yeah, well,
it won't last forever.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.255
So I've had some time to think,

38:13.258 --> 38:16.858
and, um... I realize that

38:16.862 --> 38:19.002
I've been really harsh lately.

38:18.997 --> 38:19.797
It's okay...

38:19.798 --> 38:22.068
No, let me finish,
please.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.137
I've been really hard on you
for a while now.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.737
And I've been...

38:27.739 --> 38:29.939
so upset and so angry.

38:29.941 --> 38:34.141
And... I did,
I felt really betrayed.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.776
I know.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.951
But I realize you've...

38:37.949 --> 38:40.149
you've been working so hard
to make it right,

38:40.152 --> 38:43.592
and I feel like,
for the sake of Trixie,

38:43.588 --> 38:45.288
that we should go on the trip.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.120
You know, we should go,

38:47.125 --> 38:49.985
like we always have.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.297
I can't do that.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.628
Wh... What do you mean?

38:58.337 --> 39:00.597
You were right before.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.970
We shouldn't lie
to our daughter.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.935
Okay.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.879
Look, I-I'm always gonna be
Trixie's dad.

39:12.384 --> 39:15.124
And I'm always gonna be
part of your lives.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.820
But we've been living
in the past for too long.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.990
We're no, we're no good
for Trixie

39:23.995 --> 39:26.025
if we're no good for each other.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.738
But I think we both
know the truth.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.339
It's time we get a divorce.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.927
Hello, Luci.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.566
Tell me you didn't do it.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.901
Do what?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.166
Don't play stupid with me.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.014
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

40:12.377 --> 40:13.877
Easy, Lucifer.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.279
Your brother didn't
send me to Hell,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.250
if that's what
you're worried about.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.419
But you were so adamant.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.949
I told you, Lucifer,

40:21.953 --> 40:24.753
a mother's love counts
for more than you think.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.916
My time on Earth
has helped me to realize

40:26.925 --> 40:29.725
that Father has a tendency
to overreact.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.158
So you're going
against Dad?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.672
Things change, brother.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.227
Do they?

40:38.570 --> 40:41.000
Well, I for one am grateful
that we're all just

40:41.006 --> 40:44.466
in the same room, together,
as a family again.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.936
Yes, not so fast, Mother.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.745
You see, I did
make a promise,

40:48.747 --> 40:50.647
and I am a man of my word.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.479
I told you
that you could stay here

40:52.484 --> 40:53.824
until I figured out how to

40:53.819 --> 40:55.749
reconcile my
deal with Dad,

40:55.754 --> 40:57.794
and now I have.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.159
So you're going to
punish me anyway?

40:59.157 --> 41:01.157
I am, indeed.
And not because

41:01.159 --> 41:04.029
I've been brainwashed by Dad
or I'm trying to prove anything.

41:04.029 --> 41:07.959
I punish because I'm good at it.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.166
I like giving people their due.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.043
Makes me happy.

41:13.038 --> 41:16.738
I suppose I can't ask
for a better reason.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.040
Which brings me
to your sentence.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.884
Mother...

41:24.883 --> 41:28.053
you shall remain
right here on Earth

41:28.053 --> 41:31.253
amongst the creatures
you so despise...

41:31.256 --> 41:32.416
as one of them.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.424
Wait.

41:34.426 --> 41:35.786
You're going to send me

41:35.794 --> 41:38.234
into the life
of Charlotte Richards?

41:38.230 --> 41:39.700
Mm-hmm.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.828
Well, how's that
supposed to work?
Not my problem.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.373
And what if I refuse?

41:43.368 --> 41:46.238
You can't fight this;
you're human now.

41:46.238 --> 41:47.438
But that husband...

41:47.439 --> 41:48.669
And there's children, right?

41:48.673 --> 41:49.943
They're going to <i> need</i> things.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.911
Oh, I'm counting on it.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.110
But if you truly want
to be with your sons,

41:54.112 --> 41:57.212
then that's the price
that you have to pay.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.485
So be it.

42:27.445 --> 42:29.275
Your money or your life, bitch.

42:29.281 --> 42:31.111
I-I choose money.

42:31.917 --> 42:34.077
Does anyone choose life?

42:34.085 --> 42:36.185
That doesn't very...
Come here!

42:36.187 --> 42:38.417
I'll give you what you want!
Just hold on.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.363
I said, hold on!
