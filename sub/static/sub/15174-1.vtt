that's what's wrong.

No, Mother Superior.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.719
Good.

20:04.720 --> 20:08.799
What they were doing was
something very, very naughty.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.199
They thought they could do
it without being caught.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.879
But when we do something naughty,

20:14.880 --> 20:17.159
we are always caught.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.919
And then we are punished.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.766
Punishment is absolute.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.888
Punishment is necessary.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.763
- Punishment is good.
- Yes, Mother Superior.

20:33.600 --> 20:38.085
- You left your room, William.

There must be some job that
you can give this boy.

- Why, he just turned...
- I'm sorry, Sister,

25:43.640 --> 25:45.879
but I only have one job open

25:45.880 --> 25:48.239
and it's for a man, not for a boy.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.959
It's in the stock

25:50.960 --> 25:53.519

Sorry I couldn't help.

about it solutionwise.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.039
It ain't that simple, Mr. Sims.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.439
I just got a call from
one of the employees.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.519
Seems he went ice-skating last
night and broke his ankle.

everything around here?

32:52.280 --> 32:54.279

32:54.280 --> 32:57.159
The agency's only got women.

32:57.160 --> 33:01.724
This job requires a person
of the male persuasion.

work back here no more.

tell you his new job.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.759
