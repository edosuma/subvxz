00:10.000 --> 00:16.074

00:20.233 --> 00:23.967
The Junior
Division's fate was sealed.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.733
Diana Pombo

00:29.733 --> 00:31.067
and Eva Igo

00:31.067 --> 00:33.167
made it to the divisional final.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.100
That puts you on the leader board

00:35.100 --> 00:36.600
into first place!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.467
- This Cut round... is brutal.
- You're going through!

00:42.667 --> 00:44.533
The remaining acts
in the Team Division...

00:46.333 --> 00:49.633
At this point in the game,
it's nothing but respect.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.333
...and the Upper Division

00:54.800 --> 00:57.767
have one shot...

00:57.767 --> 00:59.767
I don't think we've ever worked harder.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.800
...to impress the judges.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.233
This is a Cut round.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.900
You gotta bring all
your strengths to the table.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.667
That's risky.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.200
I've seen you do better.
I expect better.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.033
And special guest
judge and dance icon,

01:13.033 --> 01:16.533
Misty Copeland, who made
history as the first

01:16.533 --> 01:19.100
African American
female principal dancer

01:19.100 --> 01:21.567
with the prestigious
American Ballet Theater.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.133
I'm honored to be a part of this show.

01:25.767 --> 01:28.267
I feel like I can relate
to a lot of these dancers.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.267
I felt like that 14-year-old girl,

01:30.267 --> 01:31.933
like, seeing NSYNC for the first time.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.867
- Yeah!
- I was like, ohh!

01:35.400 --> 01:39.067
As only two acts
from each division

01:39.067 --> 01:43.000
can make it to next week's
divisional final.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.967
Yeah!

01:44.967 --> 01:47.667
This is gonna be the toughest
dance I've ever done.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.133
Part two of The Cut...

01:49.133 --> 01:50.333
Oh!

01:50.333 --> 01:51.867
...starts now.

01:51.867 --> 01:56.033
Hey!

01:56.033 --> 01:57.533
Swing Latino and Super Cr3w

01:57.533 --> 01:59.067
had strong showings
and currently

01:59.067 --> 02:01.633
hold the top two spots
for the Team Division.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.667
Hoping to claim one
of these spots next

02:03.667 --> 02:05.600
is the Kinjaz.

02:07.467 --> 02:08.800
Now we're in the Cut round.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.467
In this round, we know
that we have to step it up.

02:10.467 --> 02:13.733
Especially because the judges
have spoken really highly of us

02:13.733 --> 02:15.833
in the last two.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.067
You guys are the masters of illusion.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.300
I think that was
a million dollar routine.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.133
The competition's thick,
it's real.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.867
We definitely have
our work cut out for us.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.333
Kinjaz, what's going on, fellas?

02:27.333 --> 02:29.300
- Yes, sir.
- Sup, NE-YO.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.200
NE-YO is awesome.
Like, we listened to his music

02:32.200 --> 02:35.200
for years and a lot of us even
danced to some of his tracks.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.467
So at the end of the day,
to be just in

02:37.467 --> 02:39.500
the same space with this dude
is pretty cool.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.100
You've had two amazing
performances thus far.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.333
What could you possibly do
to take it to the next level?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.700
We felt that the most
important thing

02:46.700 --> 02:49.300
that we could do at this point
was to infuse purpose.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.933
Not just, like, what we're
doing with the piece,

02:50.933 --> 02:52.633
- but why we're even here.
- Ready to show me?

02:52.633 --> 02:53.633
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, definitely.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.000
All right, let's see it.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.767
Hey.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.600
People are gonna be
a little bit surprised

03:01.600 --> 03:04.033
with the track that
we're using this week.

03:04.033 --> 03:07.833
Asian Americans for some reason
aren't exactly viewed as sexy.

03:07.833 --> 03:11.133
We're kinda here
to take a stand on that one

03:11.133 --> 03:12.933
and challenge that mentality.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.500
Sweet. Nice, nice.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.400
This is definitely different
from what we've seen of you,

03:20.400 --> 03:21.567
which is a good thing,

03:21.567 --> 03:23.300
But there's always
that magic moment

03:23.300 --> 03:24.933
that makes it that much
more memorable.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.733
Let's not lose what made people go,

03:26.733 --> 03:28.633
"Oh, my God, the Kinjaz,"
in the first place.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.233
I dig that they're
trying some new stuff

03:30.233 --> 03:32.367
I just hope that
they don't go so new

03:32.367 --> 03:33.767
that we lose who they are.

03:33.767 --> 03:34.612
Yeah? Good?

03:36.933 --> 03:38.833
Everybody's got a shot at this thing.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.000
And it's not a shot at the prize,

03:40.000 --> 03:41.367
it's not a shot at the title,

03:41.367 --> 03:43.833
but it really is a shot
at leaving a legacy.

03:46.533 --> 03:47.867
Next to take the stage,

03:47.867 --> 03:50.300
it's Kinjaz.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.467
Already the Kinjaz look different.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.500
What?

04:10.367 --> 04:12.267
Oh!

05:25.333 --> 05:27.167
Whoo!

05:27.167 --> 05:31.667
Kinjaz! Wow, always
something that blows my mind.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.633
And it was just right at the top,

05:33.633 --> 05:35.600
when that thing
flew across the stage.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.667
I like, what the--

05:37.667 --> 05:39.100
What is happening?
First of all,

05:39.100 --> 05:40.700
when you guys set up,
I was saying to Misty,

05:40.700 --> 05:43.400
I was like, what club is that?
Where are they hanging out?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.367
Where do--how can we go there?
Let's go there.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.167
Come on, Misty,
let's go after work.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.100
Yeah, that was really good.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.367
But I will say, you had
one or two moments

05:52.367 --> 05:53.900
where it got a little--
somebody couldn't get

05:53.900 --> 05:55.167
the thing in their pocket.

05:55.167 --> 05:59.000
But always innovative.
What can I say?

05:59.000 --> 05:59.769
You're the Kinjaz.

06:02.367 --> 06:05.733
We are 100% fans
of what you guys do.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.667
You are here because
you deserve to be here

06:07.667 --> 06:10.400
and that's a third jacket
that I need.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.500
- I need my jacket.
- Ahh!

06:17.700 --> 06:21.800
Yeah, thank you. Yeah.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.700
I can't put it on!
Damn it!

06:26.067 --> 06:27.733
Okay, now we're ready.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.333
I feel like it was almost too perfect.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.000
Like, I don't know what to say.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.067
Like, I--

06:33.067 --> 06:34.900
I felt like that 14-year-old girl,

06:34.900 --> 06:36.633
like, seeing NSYNC
for the first time.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.600
- Yeah!
- I was like, ohh!

06:38.600 --> 06:41.633
NSYNC!

06:41.633 --> 06:43.500
All right, guys,
we're gonna lock in scores.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.767
You ready?

06:46.167 --> 06:50.600
They need more than 88.8
to make it into the top two.

06:54.867 --> 06:57.933
This is tough.
This is really tough.

06:57.933 --> 06:59.567
Kinjaz, let's check out your scores.

07:24.633 --> 07:29.033
Kinjaz, let's see where this
puts you on the leader board.

07:29.033 --> 07:32.333
The Kinjaz move into
the number one slot.

07:34.633 --> 07:41.133
and feel good *

07:41.133 --> 07:43.733
Super Cr3w, that was
an incredible, emotional,

07:43.733 --> 07:45.067
beautiful routine that you gave.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.633
I'm really sad to see you guys go.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.633
- We appreciate you.
- I really am.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.800
It hurts.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.533
We'll go out with our heads up.

07:56.533 --> 08:00.533
I can look at my brothers and
say, yo, I'm proud of you all.

08:00.533 --> 08:01.933
It's a huge relief.
We've definitely been

08:01.933 --> 08:03.733
working super hard
on this number.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.700
Misty said that she felt
like a 14-year-old girl

08:06.700 --> 08:08.567
watching NSYNC for the first time.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.667
- And we're down with that.
- Yeah!

08:11.667 --> 08:13.600
Fear not, Kinja burn!

08:19.900 --> 08:22.267
The last two acts
in the Team Division's

08:22.267 --> 08:24.067
Ian Eastwood and The Young Lions

08:24.067 --> 08:25.867
and Chapkis Dance Family

08:25.867 --> 08:28.133
fight for their spot
in the divisional final.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.733
You allow the world
to catch up to you,

08:29.733 --> 08:31.333
as opposed to chasing the world.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.767
And later tonight,

08:32.767 --> 08:35.799
the Upper Division
faces The Cut.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.033
Oh!

08:38.033 --> 08:39.832
This is a Cut round.
You gotta bring

08:39.832 --> 08:41.767
all your strengths
to the table.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.567
All right, let's see your scores.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.614
The Kinjaz and Swing Latino

08:54.614 --> 08:56.414
hold the top two spots
of the Team Division.

08:56.414 --> 08:59.014
Next to take the stage
is Chapkis Dance Family,

08:59.014 --> 09:01.414
with their unique take
on a Britney Spears classic.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.214
Chapkis Dance Family!

09:11.814 --> 09:14.180
Whoo!

09:26.114 --> 09:28.014
For me, personally,
it kinda took

09:28.014 --> 09:30.180
a wrong turn halfway through.

09:30.180 --> 09:32.814
With an 85.8,
Chapkis Dance Family

09:32.814 --> 09:34.147
has been eliminated.

09:35.816 --> 09:37.947
You guys are safe.

09:37.947 --> 09:39.647
At the top of
the leader board,

09:39.647 --> 09:42.580
Kinjaz have guaranteed a spot
in the divisional finals.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.280
Ian Eastwood and The Young Lions

09:44.280 --> 09:47.714
will need higher than a 92.5
to secure their spot

09:47.714 --> 09:48.980
in the next round.

09:52.747 --> 09:55.280
- You guys beat a giant.
- Yeah, it was crazy.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.747
How does that feel?
Like, just look in the mirror

09:57.747 --> 10:00.414
and say,
"We beat the Jabbawockeez."

10:00.414 --> 10:02.547
We're actually all
still shocked right now

10:02.547 --> 10:04.114
that we knocked Jabbawockeez

10:04.114 --> 10:05.114
out of the competition.

10:05.114 --> 10:06.580
Huge moment for us

10:06.580 --> 10:10.047
that I'm sure no one
here will ever forget.

10:10.047 --> 10:13.447
Ian came to the competition as
an untested, YouTube sensation.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.880
This week, they're in the spotlight.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.047
You can't do something
like beat the Jabbawockeez

10:17.047 --> 10:18.314
and just go home.

10:18.314 --> 10:19.947
I'm anxious to see
what they got next.

10:19.947 --> 10:21.047
All right, so let's check it out.

10:21.047 --> 10:22.447
- Let me see it.
- Let's do it.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.980
All right.

10:23.980 --> 10:26.914
This piece symbolizes
my journey through dance

10:26.914 --> 10:29.047
as well as life.

10:29.047 --> 10:30.414
I like.

10:30.414 --> 10:31.714
Initial critique--
okay, first and foremost,

10:31.714 --> 10:34.647
the picture has to be
crystal clear.

10:34.647 --> 10:37.247
Does your audience understand
what's being said?

10:37.247 --> 10:40.514
If they don't you run the risk
of losing the competition.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.314
If I can't have the million,
I want somebody worthy to get it.

10:44.705 --> 10:45.214
Next up on stage,

10:45.314 --> 10:49.947
it's Ian Eastwood and The Young Lions.

10:49.947 --> 10:51.414
All right, what are we gonna see now?

10:51.414 --> 10:53.480
Come on.

12:20.214 --> 12:22.247
Whoo.

12:22.261 --> 12:23.446
__

12:23.518 --> 12:24.673
__

12:25.580 --> 12:28.480
Probably out of most of
the acts that we've seen,

12:28.480 --> 12:30.747
you guys have evolved the most.

12:30.747 --> 12:32.047
Because when you first came out,

12:32.047 --> 12:33.614
it felt like an artist performance.

12:33.614 --> 12:36.714
But this felt like
a complete piece.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.380
It was a beautiful,
beautiful performance.

12:38.380 --> 12:39.847
And executed perfectly.

12:39.847 --> 12:40.815
Great job.

12:41.914 --> 12:43.647
You guys live and die
by who you are.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.547
You allow the world
to catch up to you,

12:45.547 --> 12:47.147
as opposed to chasing the world.

12:47.147 --> 12:48.247
I love that about you guys.

12:50.314 --> 12:52.347
However, this particular performance,

12:52.347 --> 12:55.580
the picture didn't come
all the way together.

12:55.580 --> 12:58.014
I think this was a very successful way

12:58.014 --> 13:01.780
of showing emotion
and being sensitive men

13:01.780 --> 13:03.247
through your dancing.

13:03.247 --> 13:07.747
- Like, you made me feel.
- That's all that matters.

13:07.747 --> 13:10.480
We've been pushing you
to kind of bring your routines

13:10.480 --> 13:14.514
to a point where they really
reflect how talented

13:14.514 --> 13:15.580
you guys are.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.314
And you guys came out here

13:17.314 --> 13:18.814
and gave us something
to think about.

13:18.814 --> 13:19.664
Good job.

13:22.114 --> 13:24.247
Well, we ready to lock in?

13:24.247 --> 13:25.247
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

13:25.247 --> 13:26.247
All right.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.580
Here's the moment.

13:31.580 --> 13:36.347
They need a 92.6 to make it
into the top two.

13:36.347 --> 13:38.280
All right,
Ian Eastwood and The Young Lions,

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
let's check out your scores.

13:56.714 --> 13:58.080
Let's take a look at
where it put you guys

13:58.080 --> 14:00.214
on the leader board.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.280
Third place.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.480
Hey. You guys are still in it,
going straight through

14:06.480 --> 14:07.635
to the divisional finals!

14:08.414 --> 14:11.680
Congratulations!

14:11.680 --> 14:14.480
I would love to see you start
choreographing for more people.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.080
There needs to be a style change
in choreography.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.847
I'm tired of seeing the same
old stuff over and over,

14:20.847 --> 14:22.113
and you're the change.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.347
Good job, guys.

14:30.047 --> 14:34.714
God. I know.

14:34.714 --> 14:38.180
We're up here with the most
talented dancers in the world.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.047
And we've gained an incredible
amount of inspiration

14:40.047 --> 14:41.314
because of this show.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.847
So we couldn't ask
for anything more.

14:43.847 --> 14:45.547
Kinjaz and Swing Latino

14:45.547 --> 14:49.147
are the top two teams moving
on to the divisional final.

14:49.147 --> 14:50.547
You guys will be going
head-to-head

14:50.547 --> 14:51.980
for a spot in the finale.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.114
Are you ready?

14:53.114 --> 14:54.847
Yeah!

14:54.847 --> 14:56.180
Yes! Yes!

14:56.180 --> 14:57.914
Yes! Yes! Yes!

15:02.780 --> 15:05.114
The Upper Division
enters The Cut.

15:05.114 --> 15:06.714
Hey!

15:06.714 --> 15:09.214
You guys love performing.

15:09.214 --> 15:10.247
It's fire.

15:18.206 --> 15:20.672
Last to face
The Cut is the Upper Division.

15:20.672 --> 15:23.539
Five acts remain, but only
the top two scoring acts

15:23.539 --> 15:26.372
will make it through
to the divisional finals.

15:26.372 --> 15:29.406
This week, they are being
mentored by judge Derek Hough.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.339
I'm honored to be here,
like, working with you guys,

15:31.339 --> 15:32.472
just can see what you guys
have in mind

15:32.472 --> 15:33.739
for your next routine.

15:33.739 --> 15:35.072
'Cause obviously,
this is kinda where

15:35.072 --> 15:36.106
you know, it's make or break.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.206
So should we get to it?

15:37.206 --> 15:38.639
- Yeah.
- All right, sweet.

15:38.639 --> 15:41.039
Up first,
cabaret ballroom couple,

15:41.039 --> 15:42.372
Luka and Jenalyn.

15:42.372 --> 15:44.139
The duels round went
pretty well.

15:44.139 --> 15:45.772
It went better than we expected.

15:45.772 --> 15:48.639
All I know is that
I wouldn't wanna follow that.

15:48.639 --> 15:50.306
This time, to make it
to that top two spot,

15:50.306 --> 15:52.272
we have absolutely no other choice--

15:52.272 --> 15:53.939
But to step it up.

15:53.939 --> 15:55.039
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.339
- How's it going?
- All right, man.

15:56.339 --> 15:58.072
I'm excited. I'm excited
to see your guys' stuff.

15:58.072 --> 16:01.072
Growing up as a ballroom kid,
watching Derek Hough on TV

16:01.072 --> 16:03.106
and doing a similar style to you--

16:03.106 --> 16:06.006
we always saw him as,
you know, an icon.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.239
You guys undoubtedly have,
like, the coolest

16:08.239 --> 16:09.639
partner tricks, you know?

16:09.639 --> 16:11.239
Some of which I've never seen.

16:11.239 --> 16:12.772
I think my biggest thing
today that I want

16:12.772 --> 16:14.139
to try and see
and work on a little bit

16:14.139 --> 16:15.506
is a little bit more intention.

16:15.506 --> 16:17.606
The bits in between the tricks.

16:17.606 --> 16:19.139
Let's walk through it, let's
kinda walk through some stuff.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.072
Luka and Jenalyn's tricks are amazing.

16:24.072 --> 16:25.406
Sometimes death-defying.

16:25.406 --> 16:27.072
But for me, it's about marrying

16:27.072 --> 16:29.372
the dancing in between
the tricks and the movements

16:29.372 --> 16:31.339
that will create
a complete performance.

16:31.339 --> 16:32.839
You know, chemistry,
some people are like,

16:32.839 --> 16:33.839
you either have it
or you don't.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.172
I don't really believe that.

16:35.172 --> 16:36.939
I think that you can
actually manufacture

16:36.939 --> 16:39.039
- certain moments of chemistry.
- 100%.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.606
And a lot of that is just breath.

16:40.606 --> 16:44.072
- Yeah.
- Like, just, like--

16:44.072 --> 16:45.506
- Here, you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.272
Where there's, like,
a moment of, like suspense

16:47.272 --> 16:49.306
between the two of you
and then it goes into something.

16:49.306 --> 16:51.006
We definitely really need
to remember that

16:51.006 --> 16:53.172
this is not "World of Tricks,"
it's "World of Dance."

16:53.694 --> 16:56.861
So incorporating more of
that dance into what we do is--

16:56.861 --> 16:58.394
Is gonna be a key to our success.

16:58.394 --> 16:59.928
- Well, thanks--I mean--
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:59.928 --> 17:01.794
- Kill it! Go get it.
- Thank you so much, honestly.

17:07.661 --> 17:08.828
We know what's at stake.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.993
To be one of the top two

17:09.993 --> 17:11.728
is all that matters right now.

17:11.728 --> 17:14.728
Please welcome
Luka and Jenalyn.

17:20.528 --> 17:22.961
All right, guys.

17:22.961 --> 17:24.728
All right, last category.

17:24.728 --> 17:29.761
- Let's go.
- Here we go!

17:53.261 --> 17:54.861
Yes.

18:08.961 --> 18:15.828
♪ Hills have eyes,
♪ the hills have eyes ♪
♪ Hills have eyes,

18:41.928 --> 18:43.461
Like, wow!

18:43.461 --> 18:45.728
Yeah! Look at him go!

18:50.261 --> 18:53.928
The new ways that you guys
invent to do tricks

18:53.928 --> 18:58.594
and lifts and new ways to throw
her around your body is nuts.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.728
You did up your game
from last week

19:00.728 --> 19:03.061
I feel like if I would say anything,

19:03.061 --> 19:07.261
I would like to see
a little bit more dancing.

19:07.261 --> 19:09.161
I wish that you would've
married your movements

19:09.161 --> 19:10.628
to the music a little more.

19:10.628 --> 19:13.228
You know what I mean?
You know--great performance.

19:13.228 --> 19:15.594
You guys are amazing
at what you do, but--

19:18.028 --> 19:21.394
Overall, it was exciting
and so much fun to watch.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.328
But I wanna see more
of a connection

19:23.328 --> 19:24.761
between the two of you.

19:24.761 --> 19:26.594
I feel like-- Jenalyn,
when you connect

19:26.594 --> 19:28.494
to the audience, it's fire.

19:28.494 --> 19:31.594
And I don't see that same fire
when you're looking at Luka.

19:31.594 --> 19:33.861
We need to feel
what you're feeling.

19:34.994 --> 19:36.361
I'm gonna start off by saying

19:36.361 --> 19:37.528
congratulations
for getting to this round

19:37.528 --> 19:38.994
because you guys wouldn't be here

19:38.994 --> 19:42.728
unless you guys were fantastic,
so you're amazing.

19:42.728 --> 19:44.161
You know, I worked with you guys.

19:44.161 --> 19:45.194
I worked with the guys a little bit

19:45.194 --> 19:46.461
and we worked on
that connection.

19:46.461 --> 19:47.928
we worked on those
in between moments.

19:47.928 --> 19:50.128
I kind of was expecting a little
bit more of those moments.

19:50.128 --> 19:53.094
What do you think happened?
Why didn't we see it more?

19:53.094 --> 19:57.228
We tried to incorporate that
and tried to step it up

19:57.228 --> 19:58.394
at the same time.

19:58.394 --> 20:00.561
So, I mean, maybe we could've done

20:00.561 --> 20:04.361
less death-defying stunts

20:04.361 --> 20:06.994
Sometimes a trick is more impressive

20:06.994 --> 20:08.494
when there's not so many of them.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.128
Now, I'm rooting for you,
but I'm a little nervous

20:10.128 --> 20:12.161
for you at this moment.

20:12.161 --> 20:13.961
All right, let's lock in our scores

20:13.961 --> 20:15.061
Let's do it.

20:16.661 --> 20:18.094
Whoo!

20:20.661 --> 20:21.165
Locked in.

20:22.728 --> 20:24.661
All right, let's see your scores.

20:37.928 --> 20:39.794
Okay, okay.

20:39.794 --> 20:42.028
There's only two spots.

20:42.028 --> 20:43.361
Right now, you guys are at the top.

20:43.361 --> 20:45.161
You went first.
The top two scores

20:45.161 --> 20:46.694
will go through to the next round,

20:46.694 --> 20:48.461
but we'll see how that
holds up throughout the night.

20:53.894 --> 20:55.328
It's really frustrating,

20:55.328 --> 20:56.794
but we tried to push,
you know, ourselves

20:56.794 --> 20:59.328
into what we do best
on that stage.

20:59.328 --> 21:01.361
And at this point,
there's no regrets.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.928
It's really hard to be
the first ones that go.

21:07.661 --> 21:09.194
You guys did an amazing job.

21:12.294 --> 21:14.928
Luka and Jenalyn
are first on the leader board.

21:14.928 --> 21:16.494
But with four acts remaining,

21:16.494 --> 21:19.061
the competition
is just getting started.

21:19.061 --> 21:20.256
Fik-Shun, you are up.

21:21.194 --> 21:23.228
This is your time.

21:29.961 --> 21:32.628
After Luka
and Jenalyn score 80.5,

21:32.628 --> 21:34.028
next to face The Cut

21:34.028 --> 21:36.661
is freestyling superstar Fik-Shun.

21:41.694 --> 21:44.094
This top five is very diverse

21:44.094 --> 21:46.094
with loads and loads of talent.

21:46.094 --> 21:48.194
Like, I'm the only solo left.

21:48.194 --> 21:51.028
I'm blessed and stressed.
Blessed and stressed.

21:51.028 --> 21:53.128
- Fik-Shun, what's up, brother?
- You know, not much.

21:53.128 --> 21:54.761
- How you doing, man?
- You know, a little nervous.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.628
A little nervous?
No, don't be nervous, man.

21:56.628 --> 21:58.561
Uhh! I'm feeling anxious.

21:58.561 --> 22:00.894
I'm taking a big risk
with this next one.

22:01.510 --> 22:04.377
Fik-Shun came into
this competition with a mission:

22:04.377 --> 22:06.644
to show us real artistic range.

22:06.644 --> 22:10.510
And I'm interested to see where
he's gonna be taking us next.

22:10.510 --> 22:12.677
- I'm 22, so I'm not old.
- Getting old for a dancer,

22:12.677 --> 22:14.344
you know what I'm saying?
I'm just joking.

22:14.344 --> 22:17.577
I feel like I'm moving
through life, like, so fast,

22:17.577 --> 22:21.044
and as much as I tried to
fight it, you can't fight time.

22:21.044 --> 22:23.210
Maybe I haven't had enough time
for, like, my parents.

22:23.210 --> 22:25.244
Or, like, maybe when I'm 30,
my career might be over.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.310
- Like, I don't know.
- I've had the same fears.

22:27.310 --> 22:29.710
But that fear drives you,
you know what I mean?

22:29.710 --> 22:31.077
Well, I'm excited to see it.

22:31.077 --> 22:32.110
Let's play around with it a little bit.

22:36.044 --> 22:38.010
This week,
Fik-Shun's using props,

22:38.010 --> 22:39.910
and I want him to utilize
the props,

22:39.910 --> 22:41.510
to enhance the performance.

22:41.510 --> 22:43.644
They're not just there
for background.

22:43.644 --> 22:47.644
Think my biggest advice is that
this is a really awesome prop.

22:47.644 --> 22:50.844
I wouldn't be afraid to get
behind it and to do things,

22:50.844 --> 22:54.010
you know, whether--and you could
get over the top of it or under.

22:54.010 --> 22:55.577
It's nice being around
someone so open.

22:55.577 --> 22:57.544
It's easy to bounce ideas
back and forth.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.844
Definitely, I feel like
it was a big help.

22:59.844 --> 23:01.710
- Dude, good job, man.
- Awesome.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.210
Proud of you, brother.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.077
This is gonna be the toughest
dance I've ever done.

23:09.944 --> 23:14.144
I'm gonna go as far as I can
by giving all I can right now.

23:15.910 --> 23:17.577
Here we go!

24:08.344 --> 24:12.110
♪ I made a man so happy
♪ when I wrote a letter once ♪
♪ I made a man so happy

24:38.977 --> 24:40.810
Made me all goosey!

24:42.244 --> 24:44.677
Fik-Shun!

24:44.677 --> 24:47.110
I love the fact that you
always go for the emotion.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.777
But for me, the usage of the prop

24:49.777 --> 24:51.277
could have been
a little more poignant.

24:51.277 --> 24:53.177
Like, I dug the elements
with the umbrella.

24:53.177 --> 24:54.710
The bench threw me a little bit.

24:54.710 --> 24:58.110
I feel like this performance
was a little safe for you.

24:58.110 --> 24:59.544
I totally disagree.

25:00.045 --> 25:03.344
That's all right.

25:03.344 --> 25:05.677
I actually thought you used the prop

25:05.677 --> 25:07.310
in many ways that I'd never thought--

25:07.310 --> 25:09.677
you used it as a pen at one
point, you know what I mean,

25:09.677 --> 25:11.310
where you were writing,
and it was--

25:11.310 --> 25:14.277
it was as a cane,
and then when you did

25:14.277 --> 25:15.944
roll under it,

25:15.944 --> 25:17.910
I felt it.
I was like, "Ugh!

25:17.910 --> 25:18.729
He's dead!"

25:20.077 --> 25:21.777
And this is a Cut round.
You gotta bring

25:21.777 --> 25:23.177
all your strengths to the table.

25:23.177 --> 25:24.744
I think you did a great job of that.

25:24.744 --> 25:26.510
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

25:28.444 --> 25:30.644
As well, I disagree with NE-YO.

25:31.214 --> 25:31.777
Go, mama!

25:31.777 --> 25:33.710
That's fine.
That's fine!

25:33.710 --> 25:35.810
- Yes.
- Your use of the props,

25:35.810 --> 25:37.610
the connection of the music
to your movement,

25:37.610 --> 25:39.544
- it just made sense to me.
- Thank you.

25:39.544 --> 25:43.044
- And I loved it.
- Thank you.

25:43.044 --> 25:45.077
I mean, we worked on this
a little bit, you know?

25:45.077 --> 25:47.444
And I feel like you took on
those notes perfectly.

25:47.444 --> 25:50.844
You used the stage, you used
the prop more to tell the story.

25:50.844 --> 25:53.144
The umbrella--
you used a classic prop,

25:53.144 --> 25:55.077
and you chose, like,
to pop it instead.

25:55.077 --> 25:56.610
That's risky,
you know what I mean?

25:56.610 --> 25:58.644
- Very risky.
- I've dropped that umbrella

25:58.644 --> 26:01.410
in that exact sort of move
many other times onstage,

26:01.410 --> 26:03.044
so, you know,
good job for nailing it.

26:04.377 --> 26:05.544
You did great, man.

26:05.544 --> 26:07.977
- Thank you.
- Really beautiful.

26:07.977 --> 26:10.110
All right, guys,
let's lock in scores.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.544
All right, Fik-Shun,
let's see your scores.

26:19.544 --> 26:19.940
Here we go.

26:22.844 --> 26:25.110
All right,
let's see Fik-Shun's score.

26:44.244 --> 26:46.444
All right.
They're tough cookies tonight.

26:48.344 --> 26:50.244
All right, let's take a look

26:50.244 --> 26:52.177
at where it puts you
on the leader board.

26:56.077 --> 26:58.744
Fik-Shun's in the top spot for now.

26:58.744 --> 27:01.544
I gotta say, I know what
you're capable of.

27:01.544 --> 27:04.544
I've seen you do better.
I expect better.

27:04.544 --> 27:06.244
- That's just it.
- Disagree.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.244
That's cool.
That's cool.

27:10.244 --> 27:11.507
Thank you,
thank you.

27:16.077 --> 27:17.477
That's what makes you you and me me.

27:17.477 --> 27:19.244
It's all good!
It's all good!

27:21.510 --> 27:23.477
With two scores
on the leader board,

27:23.477 --> 27:25.577
the competition begins.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.844
From now on,
after every performance,

27:27.844 --> 27:30.744
one act will be eliminated.

27:30.744 --> 27:32.110
Next to take the stage

27:32.110 --> 27:34.744
is premier flamenco troupe Pasión.

27:34.744 --> 27:36.444
We gotta do something this week

27:36.444 --> 27:38.977
that's gonna get the judges
out of their chairs

27:38.977 --> 27:42.144
and feeling like they've
experienced something explosive.

27:49.344 --> 27:50.644
Wow!

28:00.077 --> 28:02.210
I just feel like it just
left me, like, wanting more,

28:02.210 --> 28:04.177
but maybe not in the best way.
You know what I'm saying?

28:04.177 --> 28:06.344
With a score of 78.8,

28:06.344 --> 28:09.444
Pasión did not make The Cut
and are out of the competition.

28:09.444 --> 28:11.910
We had an amazing experience.
Thank you.

28:11.910 --> 28:14.177
Like, how are you feeling
right now at this moment?

28:14.177 --> 28:16.077
I mean, you know, we--
obviously we're still

28:16.077 --> 28:17.644
in the top two,
but we know the talent

28:17.644 --> 28:19.344
- that's coming next...
- Yeah.

28:19.344 --> 28:21.410
So, you know, the pressure
only goes up from here.

28:26.710 --> 28:29.144
With only two acts
left in the Upper Division,

28:29.144 --> 28:31.444
Les Twins,
and Keone and Mari

28:31.444 --> 28:32.977
leave it all on the stage.

28:32.977 --> 28:34.810
Let's see your scores.

28:42.410 --> 28:45.410
Fik-Shun and Luka
and Jenalyn currently hold

28:45.410 --> 28:47.677
the top two positions
in the Upper Division.

28:47.677 --> 28:50.410
Up next, Parisian brothers Les Twins.

28:55.277 --> 28:56.810
Dancing is what we love to do.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.744
We're confident when
we're dancing 'cause it's--

28:58.744 --> 29:02.277
it's literally what we did
way before talk or walk.

29:02.277 --> 29:06.444
It's just so, so easy for us
to literally speak

29:06.444 --> 29:09.210
with our body than talk.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.244
Like, you can tell.
Like...

29:11.244 --> 29:13.377
The Duel was crazy.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.110
Ohh!

29:17.044 --> 29:20.377
You just showed everybody
how the battle should be.

29:20.377 --> 29:22.844
But now, there's only two
is gonna pass,

29:22.844 --> 29:23.844
and three is gonna leave.

29:23.844 --> 29:25.277
This is not fair.

29:25.277 --> 29:27.244
- We just want to kill it.
- We just wanna dance.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.977
Your guys' performance
has been amazing.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.277
And you guys are very seasoned,

29:32.277 --> 29:34.644
respected for what you guys do.

29:34.644 --> 29:36.877
But you really cannot
hold back anything

29:36.877 --> 29:38.777
at this stage of the
competition now, especially.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.010
- Then show him what we got.
- Yeah, be confident.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.477
Here we go.

29:48.455 --> 29:50.222
The Twins came to this competition

29:50.222 --> 29:51.988
as probably one
of the biggest names.

29:51.988 --> 29:54.588
They're legendary in
the community of dance,

29:54.588 --> 29:56.555
and their intricacy
and their choreography

29:56.555 --> 29:58.055
is just-- it's unprecedented.

29:59.743 --> 30:01.154
__

30:01.188 --> 30:02.688
That's all right.
That's all right, man.

30:02.688 --> 30:04.055
But that's cool.
I mean, it's so sick.

30:04.055 --> 30:06.222
Like, I mean, the musicality
of it is so good.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.422
But last week's performance,
you guys did a lot of footwork,

30:08.422 --> 30:10.588
and, like, a lot of stuff
like that, right?

30:10.588 --> 30:12.804
Are you guys planning
on doing that with this one?

30:12.963 --> 30:17.445
__

30:17.584 --> 30:19.712
__

30:19.983 --> 30:22.174
__

30:22.276 --> 30:23.176
__

30:24.288 --> 30:25.322
We need a new open.

30:28.322 --> 30:30.722
Next onstage,
it's Les Twins!

31:22.888 --> 31:24.455
Whoa, hey!

31:29.555 --> 31:33.688
♪ My girl mad but she don't
want another guy
♪ My girl mad but she don't
want another guy

31:39.422 --> 31:41.388
♪ This is for them days
when you eat ♪♪
♪ This is for them days
when you eat ♪♪

32:15.755 --> 32:17.588
Whoo!

32:17.588 --> 32:19.722
Okay, I just want to say,

32:19.722 --> 32:23.522
I think it actually can
be harder when you are known.

32:23.522 --> 32:26.388
The expectation is even higher.

32:26.388 --> 32:28.688
And you guys blew me away.

32:28.688 --> 32:31.188
- Thanks.
- It was a full body,

32:31.188 --> 32:34.188
- soul performance.
- Thank you.

32:34.188 --> 32:36.755
- Bravo.
- Your reputation precedes you.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.455
We know who you are,
but you're gonna work for it,

32:39.455 --> 32:41.022
and so far, you've been working
your asses off, so...

32:41.022 --> 32:42.288
It's that important to you.
Yeah.

32:42.304 --> 32:44.213
__

32:44.222 --> 32:46.355
Guys, I had the privilege
of, you know, spending some time

32:46.355 --> 32:47.555
with you guys, getting to know you.

32:47.555 --> 32:48.922
- Our mentor.
- Larry and Laurent,

32:48.922 --> 32:50.288
you guys are the best.

32:50.288 --> 32:51.722
I saw you in rehearsals,

32:51.722 --> 32:53.188
and you were holding back for sure.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.022
I was shy.
I was shy!

32:56.022 --> 32:58.822
'Cause the heel twist thing.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.988
That back bend!
That back bend, like...

33:03.988 --> 33:06.055
Oh, that was nuts!

33:06.055 --> 33:08.255
One of the things I noticed
about you this time,

33:08.255 --> 33:13.088
you guys love performing,
and it shows so much.

33:13.088 --> 33:15.855
And it's the love
that you have for it.

33:15.855 --> 33:18.922
- Yes!
- Maybe that's the "it" thing

33:18.922 --> 33:20.322
that everybody's always talking about.

33:20.322 --> 33:21.722
She has "it."
He has "it."

33:21.722 --> 33:23.788
They have "it."
What is that "it" thing?

33:23.788 --> 33:25.288
- It's the love.
- Love.

33:25.288 --> 33:26.822
Because the love is everything.

33:26.822 --> 33:28.488
That's it, that's it.

33:28.488 --> 33:30.588
All right,
should we lock in the scores?

33:30.588 --> 33:32.922
Should we do it?

33:32.922 --> 33:35.222
Okay, so you guys got an 80.5.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.422
Les Twins score anything higher
than an 80.5,

33:37.422 --> 33:38.522
- you guys will be gone.
- I'll say bye.

33:38.522 --> 33:39.655
You know, what happens,
happens.

33:39.655 --> 33:41.188
- Yup.
- You can't control that.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.788
Let's look where that puts you
on the leader board.

34:23.522 --> 34:25.288
Guys, keep surprising us.

34:25.288 --> 34:26.455
Keep surprising us.

34:26.521 --> 34:29.984
__

34:30.222 --> 34:32.655
- Thank you!
- I personally have looked

34:32.655 --> 34:35.121
forward to your routine
every single week.

34:35.121 --> 34:36.554
I want you to be proud
of what you've done.

34:36.554 --> 34:38.022
- Oh!
- Thank you.

34:38.022 --> 34:40.054
I don't think we've ever worked harder.

34:40.054 --> 34:42.255
I don't think we've ever
pushed each other more.

34:42.255 --> 34:44.022
And we're gonna keep growing
because of this competition.

34:44.022 --> 34:45.755
Absolutely, so all we can do
is really come back better

34:45.755 --> 34:47.987
and stronger.

34:47.987 --> 34:49.255
- That was incredible!
- Thanks.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.288
I want to know how you get your neck

34:51.288 --> 34:52.755
past your shoulder.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.621
Les Twins
knocked out Luka and Jenalyn

34:56.621 --> 34:59.322
with an impressive score
of 93.5,

34:59.322 --> 35:01.655
guaranteeing them a spot
in the next round.

35:01.655 --> 35:03.455
With only one performance left,

35:03.455 --> 35:05.222
either Fik-Shun or Keone and Mari

35:05.222 --> 35:06.455
will make The Cut.

35:12.979 --> 35:15.045
For the final performance

35:15.045 --> 35:16.445
in the Upper Division,

35:16.445 --> 35:17.879
it's Keone and Mari.

35:17.879 --> 35:19.779
- What's up, man?
- Hey, guys.

35:19.779 --> 35:23.579
We were so happy that we were
going to be mentored by Derek.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.845
Derek has probably
the most experience

35:25.845 --> 35:29.145
out of all the judges in terms
of knowledge and partner work.

35:29.145 --> 35:32.212
Up until this point, we've shown
a side of us that's maybe been

35:32.212 --> 35:33.779
a little more on the lighter side.

35:33.779 --> 35:35.812
You know, we may come off as like,

35:35.812 --> 35:37.445
"Oh, they're so happy all the time,

35:37.445 --> 35:39.245
and they love each other and
everything's perfect for them,"

35:39.245 --> 35:40.945
but it's--that's not reality.

35:40.945 --> 35:42.745
We go through tough times
like everybody else.

35:42.745 --> 35:45.179
No! No!
You guys are perfect!

35:45.179 --> 35:46.679
No! No! Don't tell me!

35:46.679 --> 35:48.879
No, I'm just kidding.

35:48.879 --> 35:50.712
No, no, no,
I appreciate that.

35:50.712 --> 35:52.852
We wanna pick up the speed
a little more

35:53.156 --> 35:54.589
the intensity in our movement,
and I think that's one side

35:54.645 --> 35:55.912
of us that we haven't shown yet.

35:55.912 --> 35:58.012
- Does it use any props?
- It's a band.

35:58.012 --> 35:59.245
All right.

35:59.245 --> 36:01.345
This story is about
a particular time in our

36:01.345 --> 36:04.245
relationship last year.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.279
Definitely the hardest time.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.445
Try it again,
have a little look at each other.

36:11.445 --> 36:13.979
So when you guys go, "bop, bop,
da-da-da," this whole thing,

36:13.979 --> 36:15.979
can you, like, look at each other?

36:15.979 --> 36:17.712
Ah! 'Cause I feel like
if you're angry at somebody,

36:17.712 --> 36:20.312
it's a little bit more,
you know, almost threatening,

36:20.312 --> 36:21.645
versus frustration,
which is like,

36:21.645 --> 36:22.879
"I just want to be rid of it.

36:22.879 --> 36:24.112
I wanna be done with it."

36:24.112 --> 36:26.679
We had to scrap all the things

36:26.679 --> 36:28.679
that we thought we knew
about marriage...

36:28.679 --> 36:29.912
- Mmm.
- Scrap all the things

36:29.912 --> 36:31.379
we thought we knew
about each other.

36:31.379 --> 36:35.579
We just had to relearn
how to love each other.

36:35.579 --> 36:38.512
You have to make the choice
to love someone,

36:38.512 --> 36:40.245
not just once, but every day.

36:40.245 --> 36:41.879
- Go.
- Okay, ready?

36:41.879 --> 36:43.745
- All right?
- One, two, three.

36:44.467 --> 36:44.912
Wait, hold on!

36:44.912 --> 36:46.012
I can't do it.

36:46.012 --> 36:48.479
I go back to that night

36:48.479 --> 36:50.579
that we fell in love,

36:50.579 --> 36:53.645
and we didn't have to look
for anyone else anymore,

36:53.645 --> 36:57.479
and just the overwhelming sense
of, like, relief

36:57.479 --> 37:00.945
that this was the one,
this was the person.

37:00.945 --> 37:02.609
Seven, eight.

37:04.212 --> 37:07.079
I love that Keone and Mari
are digging deep

37:07.079 --> 37:09.145
and going for something
more personal.

37:09.145 --> 37:11.145
Good luck out there.
I love it.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.879
- It's gonna be beautiful.
- Thank you.

37:17.712 --> 37:20.745
The message tonight is
definitely to keep fighting

37:20.745 --> 37:22.845
for things that you care about.

37:22.845 --> 37:27.412
You can't have love without
the tough parts of love.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.712
Let's welcome
Keone and Mari.

39:25.745 --> 39:29.779
What makes a true artist
a true artist

39:29.779 --> 39:31.679
is their ability to be vulnerable

39:31.679 --> 39:32.879
and honest on the stage.

39:32.879 --> 39:34.612
And what you guys brought

39:34.612 --> 39:37.745
was just genuine frustration
in your love,

39:37.745 --> 39:40.645
and everything that I felt
through that performance,

39:40.645 --> 39:43.445
you had me in
that emotional state with you,

39:43.445 --> 39:44.578
and it was beautiful.

39:45.979 --> 39:47.745
Every single time
I watch you guys perform,

39:47.745 --> 39:48.945
it makes me miss my wife.

39:48.945 --> 39:51.912
Aww!

39:51.912 --> 39:53.879
When we really learn about life

39:53.879 --> 39:55.712
is when we fall
and when we stumble.

39:55.712 --> 39:58.912
That's when we grow.
That's when we get better.

39:58.912 --> 39:59.671
Very good job.

40:01.679 --> 40:05.245
You are so intelligent
with your movement.

40:05.245 --> 40:07.345
It's like an art installation.

40:07.345 --> 40:09.212
You two are so special,
not just 'cause of your love

40:09.212 --> 40:13.245
for one another, but just what
you guys create together.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.545
- Thank you, Derek.
- Thank you.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.145
- Are we ready to lock in, guys?
- Yes.

40:24.045 --> 40:26.712
All right, the goal is
to take the place

40:26.712 --> 40:29.879
of either Fik-Shun
or Les Twins.

40:29.879 --> 40:32.545
They need higher than 84.2.

40:32.545 --> 40:34.312
Let's see what happens.

40:52.679 --> 40:55.545
Let's see where it puts you on
the leader board, let's see it.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.112
Oh, we're gonna miss you so much.

41:01.112 --> 41:01.793
Come here, my love.

41:02.545 --> 41:05.179
I did what I did.
Like, the judges judged it,

41:05.179 --> 41:06.879
