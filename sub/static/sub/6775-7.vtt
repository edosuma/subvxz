03:02.030 --> 03:03.156
HI, MOM...

03:03.160 --> 03:05.048
AND PAUL,
AND PATRICIA.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.722
WELL, I'M HERE.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.449
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE HOLIDAY INN,
AS YOU CAN SEE.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.054
UM, MOSTLY, UH...

03:13.060 --> 03:17.497
MOSTLY WE'RE FILLING SANDBAGS
AND CLEANING VEHICLE FILTERS.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.297
IN THIS
PARTICULAR WAR

03:19.300 --> 03:21.052
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO KEEP THE MECHANISMS CLEAN

03:21.060 --> 03:22.425
BECAUSE OF
ALL THE SAND,

03:22.430 --> 03:25.627
WHICH CAN BE AS MUCH
OF A THREAT AS ANY MISSILE

03:25.630 --> 03:27.325
THAT SADDAM CAN SEND,

03:27.330 --> 03:28.558
CAPT. SOMMERS SAYS.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.858
UH, I CAN'T
SAY MUCH,

03:30.860 --> 03:33.624
BUT PRETTY SOON WE'RE GONNA
GET INTO THE REAL ACTION

03:33.630 --> 03:36.098
AND WE'RE WELL PREPARED,
I TELL YA.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.056
( loud music playing )

03:38.060 --> 03:39.948
GUYS, CAN YOU--
DO YOU MIND ?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.154
I'M SENDING THIS HOME
TO MY FOLKS.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.354
I'LL BE DONE
IN A MINUTE !

03:42.360 --> 03:44.419
UH, WHAT ELSE ?

03:44.430 --> 03:46.193
UH...

03:47.760 --> 03:49.421
WE'RE PROTECTING
YOUR ASS, FOLKS !

03:49.430 --> 03:53.059
I LOVE YOU, AMERICA,
THANK YOU !

03:54.200 --> 03:55.451
C'MON, I'M JUST--

03:55.460 --> 03:58.054

03:58.060 --> 03:59.027
HI, MOM !

03:59.030 --> 04:02.056
( Victor )
C'MON, YOU GUYS,
DAMNIT !

04:03.630 --> 04:05.120
SORRY, MOM.

04:05.130 --> 04:07.849
SOME OF THESE GUYS
ARE KINDA CRAZY.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.222
They're good soldiers.

04:10.230 --> 04:13.893
I'm getting a lot of
responsibility here.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.959
I think it's been
very beneficial

04:15.960 --> 04:19.521
in terms of personal
leadership skills
and getting a job,

04:19.530 --> 04:21.293
a lot more than
had I stayed at home.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.655
Well, I've got a lot to do
before lights out,

04:23.660 --> 04:25.093
so, until next time,

04:25.100 --> 04:27.921
this is Private First Class
Victor Kowtch Signing off.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.898
( male knocking )
HEY, BUDDY,

04:29.900 --> 04:31.629
BROUGHT YOU
THE LATEST "SOUTH PARK".

04:46.930 --> 04:48.727
( beeper vibrating )

04:55.700 --> 04:58.749
FUCK, DAVID.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.293
HEY, SLEEPYHEAD.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.951
YOU KNOW,
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.995
REALLY.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.092
YEAH.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.751
THIS GUY COMES
INTO MY HOUSE,

05:08.760 --> 05:11.923
AT LIKE FOUR A.M.,

05:11.930 --> 05:13.955
HE CLIMBS
INTO MY BED,

05:13.960 --> 05:17.088
BUT, INSTEAD OF
HAVING HIS WAY WITH ME,

05:17.100 --> 05:18.749
HE JUST
PASSES OUT !

05:18.760 --> 05:21.957
AND ALL NIGHT LONG
HE KEEPS JERKING.

05:23.230 --> 05:24.822
THAT IS WEIRD.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.855
AND, HE TALKED
IN HIS SLEEP.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.225
YEAH, WHAT'D
HE SAY ?

05:28.230 --> 05:30.790
IT WAS COMPLETELY
UNINTELLIGIBLE,

05:30.800 --> 05:32.119
BUT ANGRY.

05:32.130 --> 05:33.995
THERE WAS EVEN
TEETH GRINDING.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.355
THAT EXPLAINS
THE HEADACH ES.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.124
I WAS THINKING THAT
EXPOSURE TO FORMALDEHYDE

05:39.130 --> 05:40.927
HAD GIVEN ME
A BRAIN TUMOR.

05:40.930 --> 05:43.524
HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CAFFEINE WITH THAT TUMOR ?

05:43.530 --> 05:44.952
OKAY.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.557
DAVID,
I CAN'T.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.788
( David )
Why not ?

05:51.800 --> 05:53.995
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
I DROVE MR. SENOPOLIS' BODY

05:54.000 --> 05:56.150
ALL THE WAY TO SAN JOSE,
THEN STRAIGHT BACK,

05:56.160 --> 05:58.128
I BARELY GOT
FOUR HOURS SLEEP.

05:58.130 --> 05:59.427
AND FRANKLY,
I'M GETTING TIRED

05:59.430 --> 06:01.295
OF ALWAYS GE'I'I'ING
THE SHI'I'I'Y JOBS YOU DON'T WANT.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.699
I'm half owner
of this business.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.123
YOU CAN'T LEGALLY
DO INTAKE WITHOUT ME.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.825
YOU'RE NOT A LICENSED
FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

06:06.830 --> 06:08.798
I'm getting my license
next month.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.119
IF YOU
PASS THE TEST.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.859
HEY, THANKS FOR
THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.396
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
STUDY FOR THAT TEST

06:13.400 --> 06:14.856
ON ONLY FOUR HOURS
SLEEP A NIGHT ?

06:14.860 --> 06:16.691
COFFEE AND DIET PILLS
WORKED FOR ME.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.895
Nate, I can't pick her up,
I've got a deacon's meeting,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.492
AND RICO'S GOT
VAN ESSA'S ULTRASOUND.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.027
SHIT, THE LAST TIME
I HAD TO PICK SOMEBODY UP
AT A NURSING HOME,

06:24.030 --> 06:25.827
NOBODY HAD EVEN
TOLD THE ROOMMATE SHE WAS DEAD.

06:25.830 --> 06:26.990
I HAD TO.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.798
Just be thankful
we've got the business.

06:31.830 --> 06:34.025
JUST THANKFUL
I'M NOT YOU.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.389
WHAT ?

06:43.900 --> 06:47.529
OH, IT'S MR. SENOPOLIS,
SORRY.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.853
FUCK, I SMELL LIKE
A DEAD GUY !

06:49.860 --> 06:51.498
NO, YOU SMELL FINE.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.990
YOUR LIFE STINKS,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.150
YOU COMPLAIN ALL THE TIME,
AND THAT'S REALLY DULL.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.957
HUH.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.428
DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS BORING YOU.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.091
NATE, YOU NEED
TO TAKE A BREAK,

07:01.100 --> 07:03.853
SOME MAJOR STRESS RELEASE
THAT'S NOT ME.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.521
IT'S TOO MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY.

07:05.530 --> 07:08.829
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED BEING
AN UNDERTAKER'S GIRLFRIEND.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.320
IS THAT WHAT
I AM TO YOU ?

07:11.300 --> 07:13.655
YOUR GIRLFRIEND ?

07:13.660 --> 07:16.891
I LIKE TO THINK OF YOU
AS MY MISTRESS.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.390
WELL, THEN,

07:18.400 --> 07:21.198
YOU BETTER START BUYING ME
A LOT MORE SHIT, MISTAH.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.895
GOD, I LOVE YOU.

07:25.430 --> 07:27.057
OKAY...

07:27.060 --> 07:30.154
I SAID IT,
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.391
LET'S GO TO
TWO BUNCH PALMS THIS WEEKEND.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.391
UH, WHAT ?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.697
FUCK IT, YES,

07:36.700 --> 07:38.554
I'M GONNA TAKE THE WEEKEND OFF
AND DAVID CAN JUST BITE ME.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.993
THIS WEEKEND ?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.558
YEAH, WE'LL
SIT IN HOT MUD,

07:41.560 --> 07:43.425
WE'LL GET MASSAGES,
WE'LL EAT LIKE PIGS,

07:43.430 --> 07:44.852
WE'LL DRINK A LOT.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.351
IF WE LEAVE FRIDAY NIGHT
WE CAN BE NAKED
FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.499
I GOT THREE CLIENTS
THIS SATURDAY.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.650
WELL, POSTPON E,
CANCEL, LIE.

07:51.660 --> 07:54.720
C'MON, WE'VE NEVER
TAKEN A TRIP TOGETHER,

07:54.730 --> 07:56.027
WE NEED
TO DO THIS.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.123
TWO WHOLE DAYS ?

07:58.130 --> 08:00.928
WHAT IF WE
DRIVE EACH OTHER CRAZY ?

08:00.930 --> 08:02.295
WE DON'T.

08:11.130 --> 08:12.893
HOVERING.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.922
CLAIRE, I'VE INVITED
A FRIEND OF MINE OVER
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.352
OKAY.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.954
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE NICE TO HIM.

08:32.530 --> 08:35.226
IS THIS THE GUY ?

08:37.400 --> 08:38.355
THE GUY THAT--

08:38.360 --> 08:39.998
YES.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.822
OKAY.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.594
( male )
THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE,
EVERYBODY,

08:50.600 --> 08:51.851
I KNOW WE'RE
RUNNING LATE.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.590
BY THE WAY, I SPOKE TO
FATHER CLARK THIS MORNING.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.124
HE'S HOLDING UP WELL.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.894
HE SAYS YOU FOLKS ARE THE MOST
THOROUGH SEARCH COMMITTEE

08:58.900 --> 09:01.494
HE HAS EVER
ENCOUNTERED.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.923
DAVID, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
THE LAST ONE TO MEET WITH HIM.

09:05.930 --> 09:07.124
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.018
GOOD, WE'VE BEEN
INTERVIEWING

09:09.030 --> 09:10.793
ASSOCIATE PRIESTS
FOR THREE MONTHS.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.098
IT'LL BE NICE
TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.489
CLARK STRUCK ME
AS A PLAYER,

09:15.500 --> 09:17.388
MAN OF GOD,
WANTS TO LISTEN,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.152
BUT THERE'S
EGO THERE.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.718
( female )
YOU DIDN'T
WANT JACK.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.597
CONNIE, YOU SAY THAT SO EASILY
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.488
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
SO DESPERATE.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.389
LISTEN, YOU FOLKS
HAVE TO REPRESENT
THE WHOLE CONGREGATION.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.391
AND BELIEVE ME,
IF CLARK'S NOT RIGHT,

09:30.400 --> 09:32.595
I'M READY TO START OVER
FROM THE BEGINNING.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.897
LET'S VOTE
RIGHT NOW.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.596
YOU KNOW HIM, DAVID,
HE'S BEEN A VISITING RECTOR.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.727
YOU GOT HIS RESUME.

09:38.730 --> 09:41.028
ALL THE DEACONS ARE HERE,
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY YOU CAN'T VOTE NOW.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.349
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.521
NO, I WANNA MEET
WITH FATHER CLARK MYSELF

09:44.530 --> 09:46.657
SO I CAN MAKE
THE MOST INFORMED DECISION.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.218
THIS HOW
IT WORKS, JACK ?

09:48.230 --> 09:50.118
YOU BRING IN
THE NEW GENERATION DEACON,

09:50.130 --> 09:52.849
THE NEW DEACON BRINGS IN
THE RADICAL PRIEST YOU WANT ?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.920
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THERE'S NO AGENDA HERE,
MR. KRIEGENTHALER.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.795
EXCEPT YOURS.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.324
DON'T WORRY, DAVE.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.298
I HAD A PARISH IN OHIO
WHERE PUNCHES GOT THROWN.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.722
STEELWORKERS.

10:02.730 --> 10:05.449
ST. BART'S DOESN'T
EVEN COME CLOSE.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.428
ACTUALLY, DAVID,

10:07.430 --> 10:10.319
YOUR FATHER
WAS AGAINST JACK HERE.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.524
AND AS I SAID
AT THE TIME,

10:11.530 --> 10:13.725
YOUR FATHER
WAS WRONG.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.821
( Brenda )
ROLL OVER.

10:19.430 --> 10:21.921
( Brenda )
OKAY, OKAY,

10:21.930 --> 10:24.057
THERE YOU GO,
THERE YOU GO.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.426
( laughing and moaning )

10:33.230 --> 10:34.322
WOW !

10:34.330 --> 10:36.321
FUCK, BILLY !

10:36.330 --> 10:37.820
FUCK YOU !

10:37.830 --> 10:39.991
I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF THIS
ON THE INTERNET, BUT--

10:40.000 --> 10:42.252
THE RULE IS YOU CALL
BEFORE YOU COME OVER, OKAY ?!

10:42.260 --> 10:44.649
I'M SORRY, I WAS
BIKING DOWN THE BOARDWALK,

10:44.660 --> 10:45.957
I DIDN'T HAVE
MY CELLPHONE ON ME.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.655
GOOD MORNING, NATE.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.696
BILL.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.827

11:04.600 --> 11:08.058
WELL, YOUR MOM

11:08.060 --> 11:11.097

WORST LIFE HAS TO OFFER.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.590

11:18.600 --> 11:20.852

11:20.860 --> 11:23.351

11:23.360 --> 11:25.225
AND YOU JUST KNOW
THERE IS SOME FREAK

11:25.230 --> 11:27.050

11:30.630 --> 11:32.052
WELL, I HAVE TO

12:09.430 --> 12:10.852
BOTH CARS TOTALED.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.920
I SHOULD'VE STOPPED

12:19.400 --> 12:20.992

I WAS THERE WHEN YOU PINNED
THAT HUGE GUY FROM EUREKA

12:28.360 --> 12:29.952
AND WON THE STATE
WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIP.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.598
YOU WERE THE MAN !

12:31.600 --> 12:32.749
ME AND MY FRIENDS
WERE SO JEALOUS

12:32.760 --> 12:34.557
'CAUSE WE ALL KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU WERE GETTING LAID.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.323
YOU WRESTLE ?

12:36.330 --> 12:38.548

12:38.560 --> 12:40.323
SO, WHAT ARE

12:40.330 --> 12:42.218
I RUN KOVITCH TRUCKING

12:50.130 --> 12:52.553
OKAY, I RUN A BUSINESS TOO,
LET'S JUST CUT RIGHT TO IT.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.993
OF COURSE.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.797
I BURIED BOTH MY PARENTS,
AND, NO OFFENSE,

12:55.800 --> 12:58.598
BUT I HATE YOU GUYS,
I HATE WHAT YOU DO.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.124
THE WHOLE THING OF
"LET'S ALL GATH ER,

13:00.130 --> 13:02.997
AND LOOK AT THIS
PLASTIC DEAD VERSION
OF OUR LOVED ONE."

13:03.000 --> 13:04.558
IT'S REALLY TWISTED.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.959
I WANT VICTOR
CREMATED.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.757
NO COFFIN.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.625
PUT HIM IN ONE OF THOSE
CARDBOARD BOXES

13:09.630 --> 13:11.655
YOU CHARGE
100 BUCKS FOR.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.493
I'LL TAKE HIM UP TO
WHERE OUR MOTHER'S BURIED
UP IN TEHACHAPI,

13:14.500 --> 13:16.456
AND LET HIS ASHES
BLOW AWAY.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.451
I SEE VICTOR'S
A VETERAN,

13:18.460 --> 13:21.429
IF YOU'D LIKE WE CAN
RESEARCH ANY DEATH BENEFITS
HE MIGHT BE DUE.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.352
NO, VIC HATED
THE ARMY.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.499
ME AND HIM BEEN FIGHTING
THE ARMY FOR SEVEN YEARS.

13:25.500 --> 13:30.096
HIS UNIT CLEANED UP A PLACE
CALLED BUNKER 73

13:30.100 --> 13:31.920
IN THE IRAQI DESERT.

13:31.930 --> 13:34.490
CHEMICALS ALL OVER,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.422
SADDAM'S STUFF
WE BLEW UP.

13:36.430 --> 13:38.819
AS SOON AS HE CAME BACK
HE GOT SICK.

13:38.830 --> 13:40.923
LUNG CANCER
AT THE AGE OF 29,

13:40.930 --> 13:42.522
NEVER SMOKED
A DAY IN HIS LIFE.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.192
STILL NO ONE WILL SAY THE WORDS
"GULF WAR SYNDROME".

13:45.200 --> 13:48.556
HE JUST WASTED AWAY
IN AND OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.222
SO, FUCK THE ARMY.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.221
LET 'EM KEEP
THEIR FUCKING MONEY.

13:56.230 --> 13:59.825
I GOTTA FLY UP TO IDAHO FALLS
TO TELL MY STEPFATHER.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.525
HE'S GOT ALZHEIMER'S,

14:01.530 --> 14:03.259
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'LL HEAR ME OR NOT.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.388
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU
WOULDN'T LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY

14:06.400 --> 14:08.425
TO SAY GOODBYE
TO VICTOR BEFORE-- ?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.022
I ALREADY SAID GOODBYE.

14:10.030 --> 14:12.191
JUST DO IT.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.452
AND AS FOR A RECEPTACLE
FOR HIS CREMAINS--

14:14.460 --> 14:17.452
A PAPER SACK
OUGHTA DO JUST FINE.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.324
900 BUCKS.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.925
WELL, HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE POSEIDON SOCIETY,

14:25.930 --> 14:28.194
OR THAT'S 900
WE'D BE OUT OF.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.452
THAT GUY WAS THE SHIT
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.951
I NEVER EVEN KNEW
HE HAD A BROTHER.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.121
IT'S TIME YOU
INTRODUCED YOURSELF,

14:35.130 --> 14:37.291
HE'S AT
THE V.A. HOSPITAL.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.155
ALRIGHT, FIRST I JUST GOTTA
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.799
NATE, IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION,
I CANNOT SPARE YOU.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.495
WE HAVE THREE BODIES
RIGHT NOW.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.592
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.454
MR. JACOBSEN'S GOING
INTO THE GROUND TOMORROW,

14:47.460 --> 14:49.018
AND VIC KOVITCH
WILL BE TOAST BY THE WEEKEND.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.156
WHAT IF WE GET
ANOTHER BODY ?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.297
ORTWO?

14:51.300 --> 14:52.995
WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO TURN DOWN BUSINESS,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.649
NO, I'M SORRY.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.252
I DON'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.125
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE I'VE HAD TWO DAYS OFF ?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.757
SEE, HERE'S
THE DIFFERENCE,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.591
YOU'RE WILLING
TO LIVE LIKE THAT,
I'M NOT.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.649
I'VE INVITED MY FRIEND
HIRAM GUNDERSON OVER
TO DINNER TONIGHT.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.196
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO JOIN US.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.225
WOULDN'T A RESTAURANT
BE BETTER ?

15:08.230 --> 15:09.390
THIS IS
OUR HOME.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.356
THIS IS MY HOME.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.555
OH, THE CAMPING GUY.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.822
OKAY.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.593
CAN I BRING
BRENDA ?

15:17.900 --> 15:19.891
HIRAM WILL BE
COOKING.

15:19.900 --> 15:23.324
HE SPENT 17 YEARS
AS A TOP CHEF IN CHICAGO.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.298
THE FOOD CRITIC
OF "THE SUN TIMES"

15:25.300 --> 15:27.393
CALLED HIM "THE FATHER
OF THE NEW RUSTIC CUISINE".

15:27.400 --> 15:29.755
AND THEN,
HE GAVE IT ALL UP

15:29.760 --> 15:31.523
TO BECOME
A HAIRDRESSER.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.828
AND HE HAS
NEVER BEEN HAPPIER !

15:39.860 --> 15:42.397
( female )
YOU'RE MULTIPLYING
DIFFERING VARIABLES,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.858
SO, YOU HAVE TO
SIMPLIFY.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.590
OKAY, AND THEN FINALLY,
OOPS, LOOK AT THAT,

15:48.600 --> 15:50.693
SAME VARIABLE,
OKAY ?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.588
FOUR AND FOUR
GIVES US WHAT ?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.898
EIGHT !

15:54.900 --> 15:56.993
AND FINALLY,
THESE TWO BINOMIALS,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.059
RIGHT HERE,

15:59.060 --> 16:01.153
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME,
SO, WE WHAT ?

16:03.900 --> 16:05.697
COMBINE !

16:05.700 --> 16:09.750
TWO, X TO THE THIRD,
Y TO THE FOURTH.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.925
OKAY ?

16:17.230 --> 16:18.492
ANY QUESTIONS ?

16:21.900 --> 16:23.822
CLAIRE FISHER.

16:25.330 --> 16:26.888
WHAT ?

16:26.900 --> 16:29.152
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS FORMULA
TO THE CLASS ?

16:29.160 --> 16:30.923
NOT REALLY.

16:30.930 --> 16:33.490
MAYBE IF YOU PAID ATTENTION
IN CLASS INSTEAD OF READING.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.252
MAYBE IF YOU
TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING

16:35.260 --> 16:37.899
THAT WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
BE USEFUL TO ME I WOULD.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.152
OH, ALGEBRA
IS USELESS, MM-HMM.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.027
I KNOW A LOT OF PHYSICISTS
WHO'D BEG TO DIFFER.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.157
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A PHYSICIST.

16:45.160 --> 16:49.256
ALGEBRA FORCES YOUR MIND
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS LOGICALLY.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.490
IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY
PERFECT SCIENCES IN THE WORLD--

16:51.500 --> 16:53.229
YOU THINK THE WORLD
RUNS ON LOGIC ?

16:53.230 --> 16:54.492
C'MON,
OPEN YOUR EYES.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.822
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER CLASS, MISS FISHER.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.596
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

17:05.930 --> 17:07.329
OW!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.820
NOW, LET'S
TRY ANOTHER ONE,

17:12.830 --> 17:14.388
AND I'M GONNA MAKE THIS
A LITTLE TOUGHER.

17:16.830 --> 17:19.719
( teacher )
OKAY, X TO THE A POWER,

17:19.730 --> 17:21.994
TIMES Y
TO THE B POWER.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.491
OKAY, NOW
WE'VE GOT TWO...

17:30.000 --> 17:33.322
OF COURSE WE HAVE CATALOGS
FOR WEDDING PACKAGE.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.888
BUT YOU HAVE TO
COME IN AND LOOK,

17:34.900 --> 17:36.390
I CAN'T SHOW YOU
OVER THE PHONE.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.119
WEBSITE ?
WHAT WEBSITE ?

17:39.130 --> 17:40.654
WE DON'T
HAVE WEBSITE.

17:42.360 --> 17:46.729
MISTER, YOU HAVE TO COME INTO
MY SHOP AND LOOK AT MY WORK.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.550
"WEBSITE. "

17:50.330 --> 17:52.651
AH, THE DAY
JUST GETS BRIGHTER.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.752
HUSH.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.251
SO, WHO'S
DEAD NOW ?

17:56.260 --> 17:57.420
AND WHAT YOU NEED ?

17:57.430 --> 17:58.727
NOBODY'S DEAD.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.595
I CAME TO RETURN
THESE VASES.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.625
YOU SHOULD RECYCLE THEM,
SAVE A LITTLE MONEY.

18:02.630 --> 18:06.157
SO THOUGHTFUL,
I AM TOUCHED.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.299
DON'T BE SILLY,
IT'S WASTEFUL, THAT'S ALL.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.722
HERE.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.355
YOU STILL HAVE
THAT SIGN IN THE WINDOW.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.555
YES, YOU KNOW
SOMEBODY GOOD ?

18:15.560 --> 18:16.652
I DO...

18:16.660 --> 18:17.854
ME.

18:17.860 --> 18:18.792
YOU ?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.894
I AM INTERESTED,
LET'S TALK.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.253
ROBBIE,
I GOING TO LUNCH.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.989
I'M NOT GOING
TO LUNCH WITH YOU, NIKOLAI.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.558
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.323
SO WHAT ?
THIS IS BUSINESS.

18:28.330 --> 18:29.422
I HOPE SO.

18:29.430 --> 18:31.318
BECAUSE OTHERWISE
I WITHDRAW MY OFFER.

18:31.330 --> 18:34.094
TELL ME,
WHY I SHOULD HIRE YOU ?

18:34.100 --> 18:35.988
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PEOPLE
FOR OVER 30 YEARS,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.820
AND I KNOW HOW TO
TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.627
I RESPECT
PEOPLE TOO.

18:39.630 --> 18:41.894
YOU'RE POMPOUS AND ARROGANT
AND YOU'RE FULL OF YOURSELF.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.425
YOU ACT LIKE
THE CUSTOMER NEEDS YOU.

18:44.430 --> 18:46.091
OF COURSE
THE CUSTOMER NEEDS ME.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.328
I HAVE
WHAT HE WANTS.

18:47.330 --> 18:48.922
YOU'LL NEVER BUILD
A BUSINESS THAT WAY.

18:48.930 --> 18:51.251
I'M BETTER WITH PEOPLE
AND I KNOW ABOUT FLOWERS.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.091
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK SO
YOU CAN FIRE ME.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.294
FIRE YOU ?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.224
HOW I CAN FIRE YOU,
YOU DON'T EVEN WORK YET ?

19:01.230 --> 19:04.552
MY PARISH IN NEW MEXICO,
I THINK THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.721
THEY RECOMMEND
YOU HIGHLY.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.028
THEY ALWAYS DO
AFTER I'M GONE.

19:09.030 --> 19:11.328
I WON'T LIE
TO YOU, DAVID,

19:11.330 --> 19:13.958
I'LL PUSH FOR
SOME CHANGE AT ST. BART'S.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.349
THIS IS ONE OF
THOSE CONGREGATIONS

19:16.360 --> 19:19.056
THAT THINKS SITTING
THROUGH CHURCH ONCE A WEEK

19:19.060 --> 19:21.199
ABSOLVES THEM OF
ALL MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

19:21.200 --> 19:22.895
AND THEY CAN IGNORE
THE PLIGHT OF OTHERS.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.858
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.927
THEY'RE JUST LAZY.

19:28.930 --> 19:31.148
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ENTIRELY FAIR, CLARK.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.388
WE HAVE
A HOMELESS OUTREACH--

19:32.400 --> 19:34.891
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
THE SWING VOTE.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.453
I'VE BEEN A DEACON
THREE WEEKS,

19:37.460 --> 19:40.327
I'M STILL GETTING
USED TO HOW POLITICAL
THE WHOLE THING IS.

19:40.330 --> 19:42.457
RELIGION IS
POLITICS, DAVID.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.755
JESUS WAS
A REVOLUTIONARY.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.722
AND THEY'D DO
THE SAME THING TO HIM TODAY.

19:52.730 --> 19:54.823
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH
LUCK YOU'LL HAVE

19:54.830 --> 19:56.889
GETTING ST. BART'S
TO STAGE A COUP.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.698
THE LAST THING THAT GOD
WANTS FROM US IS COMPLACENCY.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.521
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BE IN THE PEACE CORP.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.656
ALREADY DONE IT.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.922
THREE YEARS
IN NICARAGUA,

20:04.930 --> 20:06.352
FRESH OUT OF
DIVINITY SCHOOL.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.658
THAT'S WHERE
I LOST MY WIFE.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.696
I'M SORRY.

20:16.030 --> 20:18.590
THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT MY WORK IS

20:18.600 --> 20:21.319
THE FACT THAT
MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT

20:21.330 --> 20:23.321
A REAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH GOD.

20:23.330 --> 20:26.026
SURE, THEY'LL PRAY TO A MAN
NAILED TO A CROSS,

20:26.030 --> 20:29.249
BUT THEY'LL IGNORE
A GAY KID WHO GETS STRUNG UP,

20:29.260 --> 20:31.694
OR THE BLACK MAN
WHO GETS DRAGGED BEHIND A CAR,

20:31.700 --> 20:34.123
OR SOMEONE'S MOTHER
LIVING IN A BOX.

20:34.130 --> 20:37.122
WERE YOU THIS FORTHCOMING
WITH THE OTHER DEACONS ?

20:37.130 --> 20:39.519
HARDLY.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.751
WHAT DID YOU
AND WALTER KRIEGENTHALER
TALK ABOUT ?

20:43.760 --> 20:44.954
GOLF.

20:46.630 --> 20:50.225
SO, WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO BE SO HONEST WITH ME ?

20:53.900 --> 20:56.391
BECAUSE I CAN TELL
THAT RIGHT AND WRONG

20:56.400 --> 20:58.322
ACTUALLY MATTER
TO YOU.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.128
THIS THING
IS FUCKING MEDIEVAL.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.052
WE GOTTA GET IT FIXED
BEFORE SOMEBODY LOSES A FINGER.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.948
YOU NEVER CARED
UNTIL IT WAS YOUR FINGER.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.825
RICO, A LITTLE HELP ?

21:20.830 --> 21:22.889
WHY SHOULD I ?

21:22.900 --> 21:25.221
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU
I'M GONNA BE WORKING
DOUBLE SHIFTS THIS WEEKEND.

21:25.230 --> 21:28.028
OKAY, THAT'S JUST
DAVID BEING DRAMATIC.

21:28.030 --> 21:30.624
WE'D HAVE TO GET
AT LEAST TWO NEW BODIES
FOR THAT TO BE NECESSARY.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.127
THEY COME IN BIGGER
NUMBERS THAN THAT.

21:34.130 --> 21:36.997
JUST FORGET IT,
I KNOW THE SCORE.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.049
IT'S NEVER GONNA BE
"FISHER & SONS & DIAZ",

21:40.060 --> 21:41.493
I KNOW THAT.

21:42.230 --> 21:44.027
LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.258
THIS ONE'S A DIRECT CREMATION,
NOTHIN' FOR YOU.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.854
OH, FUCK,
WHAT IS THAT ?

21:47.860 --> 21:50.658
SHOULDN'T JUST BURN PEOPLE
LIKE THEY'RE GARBAGE.

21:50.660 --> 21:54.198
WHAT THE ?

22:04.300 --> 22:06.154
LOOK, IT CAME
WITH FRIES.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.155
LOOK AT THIS.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.151
DOESN'T EVEN LOOK
LIKE THE SAME GUY, DOES IT ?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.094
THIS SAYS HE APPLIED TO BE
BURIED AT THE NATIONAL CEMETERY.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.523
HERE'S SIGNED REQUESTS
FOR A FLAG-FOLD,
MILITARY ESCORT.

22:20.530 --> 22:24.626
OH, MAN, THEN
YOU CAN'T BURN HIM.

22:26.530 --> 22:28.657
I CAN MAKE HIM
LOOK LIKE THAT AGAIN.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.651
WELL, ALMOST.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.788
( male )
YOU CAN ACE ALGEBRA, CLAIRE,
AND WE BOTH KNOW IT.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.258
POWER RESTS ON THE KIND OF
KNOWLEDGE ONE HOLDS.

22:37.260 --> 22:39.125
WHAT'S THE USE OF KNOWING
SOMETHING THAT'S USELESS ?

22:39.130 --> 22:40.757
DON'T QUOTE
CASTENEDA AT ME.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.455
WHY NOT ? YOU QUOTE
BOB DYLAN AT ME.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.690
YOU NEED ALGEBRA
FOR COLLEGE.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.225
SEE, YOU'RE JUST ASSUMING
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE.

22:47.230 --> 22:49.221
I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING
THE P.S.A.T. TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

22:49.230 --> 22:50.527
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

22:50.530 --> 22:51.849
IS THAT
THE ONLY OPTION ?

22:51.860 --> 22:53.122
GO TO COLLEGE,
GET A JOB,

22:53.130 --> 22:54.427
SO YOU CAN
BE A GOOD CONSUMER,

22:54.430 --> 22:57.319
UNTIL YOU DROP DEAD
OF EXHAUSTION,
I DON'T WANT THAT !

22:57.330 --> 22:59.093
SO, WHAT
DO YOU WANT ?

23:00.630 --> 23:03.451
I JUST WANT
SOMETHING TO MATTER.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.519
MAYBE I SHOULD WANDER AROUND
THE DESERT AND EAT PEYOTE

23:09.530 --> 23:11.191
AND SEE GOD.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.191
YEAH, BE A HOMELESS
DRUG ADDICT.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.851
YOU'D GET BORED WITH THAT
PRETTY FAST.

23:15.860 --> 23:22.049
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD OF
THE SIERRA CROSSROADS PROGRAM ?

23:22.060 --> 23:24.324
WHAT'S THAT, LIKE
BUNGEE JUMPING FOR JESUS ?

23:24.330 --> 23:26.719
NO, IT'S NOT AFFILIATED
WITH ANY RELIGION.

23:26.730 --> 23:29.255
IT'S ACTUALLY
A GREAT PROGRAM.

23:29.260 --> 23:31.694
I SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS THERE
AS AN INSTRUCTOR.

23:31.700 --> 23:32.928
YOU MIGHT
REALLY LIKE IT.

23:32.930 --> 23:34.124
WHY ?

23:34.130 --> 23:35.893
BECAUSE IT WOULD
GET YOU OUT OF YOURSELF,

23:35.900 --> 23:37.151
GET YOU
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.196
NOW, I'LL WARN YOU,
IT'S HARD,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.895
BUT EXHILARATING.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.425
I THINK IT MIGHT
JUST GIVE YOU THE CHALLENGE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

23:43.430 --> 23:45.250
THERE'S AN EXPEDITION
GOING OUT OVER SPRING BREAK,

23:45.260 --> 23:47.091
I COULD PULL
SOME STRINGS,

23:47.100 --> 23:48.556
SEE IF I COULD
GET YOU IN.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.959
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME ?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.791
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.349
AND I WANNA SEE
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN FOR YOU
AND I KNOW THEY CAN.

23:58.660 --> 24:01.220
WE HAD TO DIG
HIS SERVICE RECORDS
OUT OF ST. LOUIS.

24:01.230 --> 24:05.826
THEN THERE'S THE BIG QUESTION
OF WHETHER HIS CANCER
WAS SERVICE RELATED.

24:05.830 --> 24:08.253
THAT MEANS FINDING A DOCTOR
WHO THINKS IT WAS.

24:08.260 --> 24:11.423
IT TOOK ME FOUR MONTHS
TO GET ALL THE APPROVALS,

24:11.430 --> 24:15.958
BUT IT MEANS A BURIAL ALLOWANCE
OF UP TO 1500 FROM THE V.A.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.428
MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE THAT STUFF TOO.

24:18.430 --> 24:19.852
I PACKED
IT UP FOR HIM.

24:19.860 --> 24:22.055
THAT'S TOO BAD NOBODY
TOLD HIS BROTHER WHAT HE WANTED.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.459
I DID.

24:23.460 --> 24:26.190
OH, YEAH,
I GAVE PAUL THE FORMS.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.849
I FOUND THEM
LATER IN THE TRASH.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.954
IT'S MOSTLY SOMEBODY ELSE'S
WRITING ON THE FORMS.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.224
IT DOESN'T MATCH
VICTOR'S SIGNATURE AT ALL.

24:33.230 --> 24:34.720
I FILLED THEM
OUT FOR HIM.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.994
HE TRIED TO
DO IT HIMSELF, BUT,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.924
THOSE BOXES
ARE PRETTY SMALL,

24:39.930 --> 24:44.094
AND HE SHOOK
A LOT.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.620
"GULF WAR
VICTORY PARADE".

24:49.630 --> 24:53.157
VICTOR SAID MARCHING IN IT
WAS THE PROUDEST MOMENT
IN HIS LIFE.

24:55.030 --> 24:57.555
WHY WOULD HE KEEP IT
AND WATCH IT OVER AND OVER

24:57.560 --> 25:00.051
IF HE HATED THE ARMY ?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.357
DID PAUL
VISIT HIM MUCH ?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.692
YEAH, THREE OR FOUR
TIMES A WEEK.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.099
HE WAS REALLY
GOOD ABOUT IT.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.158
SO, HOW COM E--

25:06.160 --> 25:07.627
HE COULDN'T.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.791
PAUL WOULD SAY, "THE FUCKING
ARMY STOLE YOUR LIFE, VIC."

25:09.800 --> 25:12.098
AND VIC WOULD
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.796
I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

25:14.800 --> 25:16.756
VICTOR WANTED
TO BELIEVE

25:16.760 --> 25:19.991
THAT WHAT HE DID IN THE GULF
MEANT SOMETHING,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.992
THAT HIS LIFE
WAS NOT A WASTE.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.696
BUT, HEY, I ONLY
COUNSEL THE VETERAN,

25:25.700 --> 25:27.850
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO INTERFERE
WITH WHAT THE FAMILY WANTS.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.851
SO YOU TAPED HIS MEDALS
TO HIS CHEST,

25:29.860 --> 25:31.999
FISHED HIS FILES
OUT OF THE TRASH
AND PASSED THEM ONTO ME.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.298
WELL, YOU CAN
ALWAYS BLOW IT OFF.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.497
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THE GUY, RIGHT ?

25:46.730 --> 25:48.925
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

25:48.930 --> 25:51.956
THERE WAS A FORM THAT SAID
HE'S GETTING A MILITARY FUNERAL.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.518
WHO AUTHORIZED THIS,
NATE ?

25:53.530 --> 25:55.293
UH, YEAH.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.222
GODDAMNIT, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU,

25:57.230 --> 25:58.356
WHEN NATE GIVES YOU
INSTRUCTIONS,

25:58.360 --> 25:59.850
YOU ARE TO CHECK
WITH ME FIRST.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.396
TURN HIM OFF.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.096
I'LL DRIVE HIM
TO THE CREMATORIUM RIGHT NOW.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.994
DO I HAVE TO
DO IT MYSELF ?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.457
FUCKING NATE.

26:10.460 --> 26:12.655
PAUL KOVITCH IS
WHO OUR CONTRACT IS WITH,

26:12.660 --> 26:14.059
AND IF HE
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS

26:14.060 --> 26:16.995
HE WILL EITHER SUE US
OR BREAK OUR LEGS.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.822
TOMATOES
RIGHT THERE.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.399
WOW.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.196
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.121
HELLO,
MRS. FISHER.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.121
HELLO, DEAR.

26:35.130 --> 26:38.293
HELLO,
I'M BRENDA.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.995
HIRAM GUNDERSON.

26:42.730 --> 26:45.858
WHY, YES,
I DO.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.496
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
WHERE NATE IS,

26:49.500 --> 26:50.899
BUT I HAVE
NO IDEA.

26:50.900 --> 26:54.324
UH, IT'S OKAY,
I CAN EXIST WITHOUT HIM.

26:56.030 --> 26:58.624
TOASTED SESAME SEEDS
IN THE SALAD ?

26:58.630 --> 27:01.724
YES, THAT WOULD
BE LOVELY.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.349
THERE'S MY
LITTLE GIRL.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.692
CLAIRE, HONEY,
THIS IS HIRAM GUNDERSON.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.625
PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU, CLAIRE.

27:18.630 --> 27:21.098
HI.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.120
THIS IS DELICIOUS,
MRS. FISHER.

27:25.130 --> 27:27.951
HIRAM IS
A CHEF.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.594
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF HIS COCK !

27:46.300 --> 27:49.929
MOM, I NEED $1200 SO I CAN GO
TO SIERRA CROSSROADS

27:49.930 --> 27:52.296
OVER SPRING BREAK.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.653
AND I NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS FORM

27:53.660 --> 27:55.423
IN CASE
I DIE OR SOMETHING.

27:55.430 --> 27:57.318
IS THIS
A SCHOOL TRIP ?

27:57.330 --> 28:01.096
NO, YOU GO TO THE MOUNTAINS
AND CONFRONT FEAR,

28:01.100 --> 28:04.422
AND GET IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR MOST BASIC SELF.

28:06.630 --> 28:08.996
IT LOOKS GOOD
ON YOUR COLLEGE APPLICATION.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.649
( Nate )
SORRY I'M LATE,

28:10.660 --> 28:12.321
THERE WAS THIS MAJOR ACCIDENT
ON THE LONG BEACH FREEWAY.

28:12.330 --> 28:13.922
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO HIT
THE BAD TRAFFIC.

28:13.930 --> 28:15.693
HI, I'M NATE.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.429
HIRAM, I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.590
DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF IT.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.057
HEY, I'M SORRY.

28:21.060 --> 28:23.722
DON'T BE,
I'M HAVING FUN.

28:23.730 --> 28:26.153
SO, WHAT DID
I MISS ?

28:26.160 --> 28:28.355
I WANNA GO
TO SIERRA CROSSROADS.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.294
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
LATER, CLAIRE.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.053
OH, MOM, YOU SHOULD LET HER GO,
CROSSROADS IS GREAT.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.220
( Claire )
YOU WENT ?

28:34.230 --> 28:36.824
YEAH, WE WENT KAYAKING
DOWN THE COLORADO RIVER

28:36.830 --> 28:38.320
THE SUMMER
I WAS 17.

28:38.330 --> 28:39.752
I DON'T THINK YOU WERE
EVEN BORN YET.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.125
I DON'T
REMEMBER THIS.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.496
AH...

28:45.200 --> 28:46.997
THAT'S BECAUSE
I LIED TO YOU AND DAD.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.321
I KNEW DAD WOULD
NEVER LET ME GO,

28:49.330 --> 28:51.252
SO I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING
TO SACRAMENTO FOR THREE DAYS

28:51.260 --> 28:53.956
TO WITNESS
STATE GOVERNMENT IN ACTION.

28:58.100 --> 29:00.318
OH, BY THE WAY, EVERYONE,
I GOT A JOB.

29:02.530 --> 29:03.724
COOL.

29:03.730 --> 29:05.948
I'LL BE WORKING
AT NIKOLAI'S FLOWER SHOP.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.188
I START TOMORROW.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.497
IT'S JUST
PART-TI M E.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.526
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT THAT.

29:11.530 --> 29:13.521
DIDN'T I ?

29:15.230 --> 29:16.527
NEED SOME HELP ?

29:16.530 --> 29:20.159
INCIDENTALLY, NATE,
I DROPPED VICTOR KOVITCH OFF

29:21.900 --> 29:23.322
I NEED YOU TO PICK HIM UP
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

29:23.330 --> 29:26.151
OH, FUCK, DAVID,
HE WANTED A MILITARY FUNERAL.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.252
HE FILLED OUT
THE FORMS.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.352
IS HE PAYING
OUR BILL ?

29:28.360 --> 29:30.658
YOU WERE THERE
WITH HIS BROTHER.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.799
IT WAS CLEAR HE DID NOT
WANT THE BODY EMBALMED.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.223
HE COULD SUE US
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE A CASE.

29:35.230 --> 29:36.788
OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

29:36.800 --> 29:38.597
WHEN YOU
TALK TO ME LIKE THIS

29:38.600 --> 29:41.228
IT MAKES ME WANNA NOT LISTEN
TO A THING YOU SAY.

29:41.230 --> 29:42.595
YOU AND I COULD
LOSE EVERYTHING.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.022
MOM COULD
LOSE HER HOME.

29:44.030 --> 29:46.396
YOU KNOW,
VIC IS ELIGIBLE

29:46.400 --> 29:49.289
FOR A MUCH BIGGER
BURIAL ALLOWANCE FROM THE V.A.
THAN WE THOUGHT.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.653
REALLY ?

29:50.660 --> 29:52.457
UH, I'M LEAVING.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.428
I'LL WALK YOU DOWN.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.949
BYE, DAVID.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.188
BYE.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.788
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER,
SPEND THE NIGHT.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.018
I CAN'T, I'VE GOTTA BE
IN PASADENA TOMORROW MORNING,

30:05.030 --> 30:06.952
IT'D ADD AN EXTRA
HOUR TO MY TRIP.

30:07.930 --> 30:08.726
OKAY.

30:11.830 --> 30:14.424
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES,
I'LL FOLLOW YOU.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.218
TONIGHT WASN'T
SO BAD, WAS IT ?

30:21.230 --> 30:23.755
I SUPPOSE NOT.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.126
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I WAS SO NERVOUS.

30:26.130 --> 30:29.998
I MEAN, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
I GAVE BIRTH TO THOSE PEOPLE.

30:37.060 --> 30:41.121
YOU KNOW WHAT OCCURRED TO ME
TONIGHT THAT'S REALLY STRANGE ?

30:42.000 --> 30:45.128
I WISH YOU'D
KNOWN MY HUSBAND.

30:45.130 --> 30:48.429
I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD'VE LIKED EACH OTHER.

30:53.530 --> 30:55.623
OH, RUTH.

30:57.060 --> 30:59.620
WHO WOULD GET ME
A GIFT BASKET ?

30:59.630 --> 31:01.621
IT'S PROBABLY SOME HOLLYWOOD
BIGWIG YOU WORK ON

31:01.630 --> 31:03.257
THAT SECRETLY
WANTS TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.253
IT'S FROM
MY BROTHER.

31:07.260 --> 31:10.388
AND IT IS ADDRESSED
TO BOTH OF US.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.958
"SORRY ABOUT THIS MORNING,
HAVE FUN AT CACT US WORLD".

31:15.960 --> 31:17.951
WHO KNOWS ?

31:17.960 --> 31:20.952
THIS IS NICE, WE CAN
TAKE IT WITH US THIS WEEKEND.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.326
I CANNOT WAIT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

31:23.330 --> 31:26.128
I'M IN DIRE NEED OF SOME
SERIOUS RELAXATION.

31:26.130 --> 31:27.529
( gasping )

31:27.530 --> 31:29.725
OH, FABULOUS.

31:29.730 --> 31:30.799
SMOKED OYSTERS.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.290
REALLY, IS THERE
ANY CAVIAR ?

31:32.300 --> 31:36.088
AH, NO, BUT
THERE ARE CONDOMS.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.948
AND, OKAY,
EDIBLE UNDERPANTS.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.928
THAT'S
A LITTLE SCARY.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.319
I'D SAY THIS WHOLE THING'S
A LITTLE SCARY.

31:44.330 --> 31:45.649
NO, IT JUST MEANS
HE LIKES YOU.

31:45.660 --> 31:48.857
BELIEVE ME, THERE ARE GUYS
BILLY DIDN'T LIKE,

31:48.860 --> 31:50.350
IT'S MUCH BETTER
THIS WAY.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.249
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU,

31:53.260 --> 31:56.627
WHAT'S UP WITH THOSE
MATCHING TATTOOS
YOU AND HE HAVE ?

31:56.630 --> 31:59.997
WE WERE IN VEGAS,
WE WERE VERY DRUNK,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.797
AN D--

32:01.800 --> 32:03.392
OH, DEAR.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.029
THESE THINGS ALWAYS STRUCK ME
AS KIND OF RIDICULOUS.

32:07.030 --> 32:08.657
WOULD YOU JUST
STOP THAT ?

32:08.660 --> 32:11.720
WHAT DOES HE THINK
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THIS ?

32:11.730 --> 32:13.550
BRENDA, THIS IS
LIKE, HOSTILE.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.323
LOOK, BILLY'S BIPOLAR.

32:15.330 --> 32:17.025
HE'S MEDICATED.

32:17.030 --> 32:19.328
HIS SENSE OF
WHAT'S APPROPRIATE CAN BE

32:19.330 --> 32:23.050
A LITTLE OFF
AT TIMES.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.188
LOOK, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.621
DON'T JUDGE HIM,
PLEASE.

32:29.630 --> 32:31.689
ALRIGHT.

32:33.330 --> 32:34.729
ALRIGHT.

32:34.730 --> 32:36.891
THANK YOU.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.723
( male )
You're never gonna work your way
out of this one, soldier.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.698
I was nowhere _
near the latrine, Sir.

33:09.700 --> 33:10.689
I promise.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.349
Give it up, Private,
your aSS is busted.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.055
Yeah, you're in
big trouble.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.392
But my father's on
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.992
Well, maybe we can't
court marshall you,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.127
but there iS
something else we can do.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.927
Yeah, come on,
Private, yeah.

33:26.930 --> 33:28.625
( phone )

33:28.630 --> 33:30.689
You love that,
don't you ?

33:30.700 --> 33:32.292
( tv shuts off)

33:33.700 --> 33:35.156
HELLO ?

33:35.160 --> 33:36.889
DAVID,
WALTER KRIEGENTHALER.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.027
DID YOU MEET
WITH FATHER CLARK ?

33:39.030 --> 33:40.622
YES, TODAY.

33:40.630 --> 33:44.054
We'd like to meet at
9:30 tomorrow and vote.

33:44.060 --> 33:44.924
Can you make it ?

33:44.930 --> 33:46.522
ABSOLUTELY.

33:46.530 --> 33:48.691
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION, DAVID.

33:50.560 --> 33:54.121
DO YOU THINK
CLARK IS GAY ?

33:55.230 --> 33:56.629
UH...

33:56.630 --> 33:58.359
I DON'T THINK SO,

33:58.360 --> 34:00.999
HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT
HAVING A DECEASED WIFE.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.628
I mean,
I don't care if he is.

34:03.630 --> 34:06.326
I just don't want him
to push that agenda.

34:06.330 --> 34:09.493
You know, marriage,
that whole thing.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.755
I HAVE A COUSIN IN D.C.
WHOSE CHURCH SPLIT
BECAUSE OF THAT.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.524
LITERALLY HALF
THE CONGREGATION LEFT.

34:16.530 --> 34:19.055
I don't wanna see that
happen to St. Bart's.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.449
I've been going there
for 40 years.

34:21.460 --> 34:25.351
Well, it's late,
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.896
Goodnight.

34:44.530 --> 34:46.919
OKAY, I GOT VICTOR,

34:46.930 --> 34:49.125
BUT I CALLED THE NATIONAL
CEMETERY FROM THE CAR

34:49.130 --> 34:51.257
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?
THEY CAN BURY AN URN.

34:51.260 --> 34:53.990
THEY CALL IT IN-URN-MENT,
WE CAN DO IT TODAY AT THREE.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.355
WHY ARE YOU SO DETERMINED
TO SABOTAGE OUR BUSINESS ?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.590
I DON'T THINK PAUL EVER KNEW
HOW HIS BROTHER REALLY FELT.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.659
NATE, WHY DO YOU
EVEN CARE ?

35:00.660 --> 35:03.151
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT
VICTOR WANTED.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.549
AND HE DESERVES IT,
HE GOT A RAW FUCKIN' DEAL.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.494
I'M TELLIN' YOU, VICTOR KOVITCH
DID NOT HATE THE ARMY.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.456
YOU JUST WATCH THESE TAPES
HE MADE IN THE GULF.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.151
( male )
YeS, sir,
fuck me, Sergeant.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.526
Give it to me.

35:18.530 --> 35:20.054
OH, COME ON !

35:20.060 --> 35:21.698
COME ON,
THAT WAS FUNNY !

35:21.700 --> 35:23.497
I HAVE SOMEPLACE
I HAVE TO BE.

35:23.500 --> 35:27.197
DAVE, DAVE, IT'S OKAY,
I WATCH PORN TOO !

35:29.630 --> 35:32.428
( whispering and giggling )

35:53.960 --> 35:57.157
SO, YOU GUYS TAKING THE P.S.A.T.
THIS AFTERNOON TOO ?

35:58.600 --> 36:01.728
UH... YEAH.

36:07.260 --> 36:09.694
SO, WHAT HAPPENS
TO YOU GUYS ?

36:11.660 --> 36:14.254
I GO TO U.C. IRVINE
AND NORTHWESTERN LAW,

36:14.260 --> 36:16.922
MEET A TOTALLY GREAT GUY,
HE'S A TRIATHLETE,

36:16.930 --> 36:19.922
WE GET MARRIED AND I PRACTICE
LAW FOR EIGHT YEARS,

36:19.930 --> 36:21.818
AND WE GET
REALLY RICH,

36:21.830 --> 36:23.695
AND THEN I HAVE
TWO GREAT KIDS.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.555
SO YOU'RE, LIKE,
UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY ?

36:26.560 --> 36:27.959
KIND OF.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.258
I GET A MASTER'S
IN FRENCH

36:30.260 --> 36:32.990
AND THEN LIVE IN PARIS
FOR SIX MONTHS,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.422
AND HATE IT,

36:34.430 --> 36:36.557
SO, I COME BACK, BECOME
A TV DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE,

36:36.560 --> 36:38.050
AND I WORK OUT
ALL THE TIME.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.550
I'M FAIRLY MISERABLE

36:39.560 --> 36:42.199
AND HAVE A SLIGHT
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.294
BUT YOU LOOK GREAT.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.393
THAN KS.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.391
I START AN INTERIOR
LIGHTING DESIGN FIRM
WITH MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE,

36:49.400 --> 36:50.822
AND IT TOTALLY TAKES OFF.

36:50.830 --> 36:53.924
AND THEN I DIE
OF OVARIAN CANCER
BEFORE I'M 30.

36:53.930 --> 36:55.852
OH, THAT SUCKS.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.623
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.526
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.651
WHAT A FREAK.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.318
FATHER JACK ?

37:23.330 --> 37:24.194
DAVID.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.155
COME IN,
SIT.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.751
AND CALL ME JACK,
WE'RE BEYOND THAT.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.456
MEETING OVER
ALREADY ?

37:32.460 --> 37:34.451
YES.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.227
DAMN.

37:37.230 --> 37:39.528
WE ALL ADMIRE
CLARK'S ENERGY,

37:39.530 --> 37:43.159
BUT THERE IS SOME CONCERN
THAT HE MAY END UP
BEING DIVISIVE.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.593
AS YOU SAID YOURSELF,

37:44.600 --> 37:46.591
IF WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND
START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING--

37:46.600 --> 37:48.852
AND FIND SOME
CONSERVATIVE LAPDOG

37:48.860 --> 37:50.623
WHO WON'T
CHALLENGE ANYBODY ?

37:50.630 --> 37:54.191
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WE NEED HERE.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.159
SCOTCH ?

37:58.160 --> 38:00.151
NO, THANK YOU.

38:01.930 --> 38:03.921
CLARK THOUGHT HE CAME ON
A LITTLE TOO STRONG WITH YOU.

38:03.930 --> 38:05.158
I LIKED HIM, JACK.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.297
I THINK THE WORLD WOULD
BE A BETTER PLACE

38:06.300 --> 38:07.756
IF THERE WERE
MORE MEN LIKE HIM.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.820
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT
HE'S A GOOD FIT FOR ST. BART'S.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.219
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT FATHER CLARK
WOULD BE HAPPY HERE ?

38:13.230 --> 38:14.891
WHY SHOULD HE
BE HAPPY ?

38:14.900 --> 38:17.323
HOW HAPPY ARE YOU ?

38:19.960 --> 38:22.326
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'M NOT HAPPY.

38:22.330 --> 38:25.493
MY LIFE IS VERY COMPLICATED
AND CONFUSING.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.229
I'VE EXPERIENCED
A LOT OF LOSS RECENTLY,

38:27.230 --> 38:28.993
MY FATHER
AND MY--

38:31.230 --> 38:33.824
AND THE ONE THING
THAT HELPS ME TO DEAL WITH IT

38:33.830 --> 38:35.798
IS HAVING A PLACE
THAT HASN'T CHANGED,

38:35.800 --> 38:37.427
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE
IN MY LIFE.

38:37.430 --> 38:40.558
THERE'S A REASON
THEY CALL IT A SANCTUARY.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.452
I THINK THE MAJORITY
OF OUR CONGREGATION
FEELS THE SAME WAY.

38:53.460 --> 38:56.452
AND MY RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO THEM, NOT YOU.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.827
WELL, I'VE GOT
A BUSINESS TO RUN.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.524
( phone )

39:14.460 --> 39:15.950
YO.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.757
SPEAKING.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.827
YES...

39:24.830 --> 39:27.151
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MR. GILARDI ?

39:28.660 --> 39:31.629
HERE, THIS IS
GOOD CHOICE HERE.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.120
I DON'T
LIKE YELLOW.

39:33.130 --> 39:36.054
THE BRIDESMAID'S DRESSES
ARE LILAC.

39:36.060 --> 39:39.097
IF THE FLOWERS ARE YELLOW
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
AN EASTER EGG HUNT.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.694
HOW ABOUT
WHITE TULIPS ?

39:41.700 --> 39:43.053
VERY SIMPLE.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.925
JUST BUNCHED TOGETHER
WITH A RIBBON.

39:44.930 --> 39:47.990
I WAS KINDA THINKING I WOULD BE
THE ONLY ONE WITH WHITE FLOWERS.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.991
OR,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.252
YOU COULD BE THE ONLY ONE
HOLDING A GORGEOUS
BOUQUET OF COLOR

39:52.260 --> 39:54.023
AGAINST YOUR
WHITE DRESS.

39:54.030 --> 39:55.224
PEOPLE DO THAT ?

39:55.230 --> 39:56.788
IT'S YOUR DAY, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.428
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY ?

39:59.430 --> 40:00.624
MM-HMM.

40:00.630 --> 40:03.224
I LOVE
THE TULIPS THING.

40:03.230 --> 40:04.959
TULIPS ARE ONE OF
MY FAVORITE FLOWERS.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.326
SO GRACEFUL
AND CLASSIC,

40:07.330 --> 40:09.958
LIKE LITTLE
BALLERINAS.

40:13.260 --> 40:15.057
THE ONLY REASON
I EVEN MET VICTOR

40:15.060 --> 40:17.824
WAS I JUMPED OFF A HUMVEE
AND BROKE MY FEET.

40:17.830 --> 40:21.493
HERE I AM IN THE HOSPITAL
WITH THIS GUY WHO'S DYING,
IT TURNS OUT,

40:21.500 --> 40:23.297
LISTENING
TO ME COMPLAIN.

40:23.300 --> 40:25.689
PLAYING CARDS,
GIVING ME HIS DESSERT.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.452
I WISH
HE DIDN'T DIE.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.792
IT SUCKS.

40:30.730 --> 40:32.220
THANK YOU.

40:34.930 --> 40:37.148
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM PAUL YET ?

40:37.160 --> 40:39.799
NOT SINCE I TOLD HIM
HIS BROTHER WAS READY
TO BE PICKED UP.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.756
WELL, WITHOUT
HIS CONSENT IN WRITING,

40:41.760 --> 40:44.320
I CANNOT ALLOW THIS FUNERAL
TO TAKE PLACE.

40:44.330 --> 40:45.422
FINE.

40:45.430 --> 40:47.523
AT LEAST WE'LL KNOW
WE MADE AN EFFORT.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.725
WHEN WE WERE
IN THE GULF

40:49.730 --> 40:52.790
VICTOR USED TO
MAKE TH ESE VIDEOTAPES
TO SEND HOME TO HIS FAMILY.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.722
WE WERE ALWAYS
GIVING HIM A HARD TIME.

40:54.730 --> 40:56.789
MESSING HIM UP.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.098
HE WAS A REAL
GOOD SPORT.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.557
THE PERPETUAL OPTIMIST.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.221
SO, MY BROTHER
READY ?

41:03.230 --> 41:05.698
YES, HE'S RIGHT
IN HERE.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.588
WHAT IS THIS ?

41:07.600 --> 41:09.488
VICTOR'S FRIENDS
WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.491
THE HOSPITAL REFERRED THEM,
IT'S NO PROBLEM FOR US.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.149
AND NO CHARGE
TO YOU.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.458
EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU HIS BROTHER ?

41:15.460 --> 41:17.052
YES, I'M PAUL.

41:17.060 --> 41:20.598
THIS MAN HERE, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU PEOPLE KNOW IT,

41:20.600 --> 41:23.125
WAS LIKE A LION
FOR VICTOR.

41:23.130 --> 41:26.918
HE MADE FEDERAL WAVES OVER
VICTOR'S DISABILITY CASE.

41:32.030 --> 41:34.749
I FOUND A COUPLE OF PICTURES
OF US PLAYING BASEBALL.

41:34.760 --> 41:38.890
VIC WAS A LOUSY BATTER
BUT A PRETTY GOOD INFIELDER.

41:40.700 --> 41:43.897
HE'S GRINNING LIKE
SUCH A FOOL IN THESE.

41:46.330 --> 41:47.695
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE 'EM.

41:52.930 --> 41:54.727
YEAH.

41:54.730 --> 41:56.891
YOU SICK ?

41:56.900 --> 41:58.356
NO.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.897
NEVER GOT SICK,
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.755
A LOT OF GUYS
I KNEW OVER THERE DID.

42:05.260 --> 42:06.750
THAN KS.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.923
THANK YOU FOR LETTING VICTOR
HAVE HIS MILITARY BURIAL.

42:09.930 --> 42:11.898
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
YOU WERE AGAINST IT.

42:11.900 --> 42:15.119
I'M SURE THIS MEANS
A LOT TO HIM.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.026
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
MILITARY BURIAL SHIT ?

42:20.030 --> 42:22.726
IT'S AN OPTION
THAT CAN EASILY BE CANCELED

42:22.730 --> 42:24.357
AT NO CHARGE
TO YOU.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.248
VICTOR DIDN'T WANT
A MILITARY FUNERAL,
I TOLD YOU THAT.

42:26.260 --> 42:27.591
YOU THINK
I'M LYING TO YOU ?

42:27.600 --> 42:28.999
I THINK HE WAS AFRAID
TO TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTED.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.390
HE FILLED OUT THOSE FORMS, PAUL,
HE KEPT THE VIDEOS.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.856
THEY FILLED OUT
THOSE FORMS.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.521
THIS IS ALL
FUCKING ARMY P.R.

42:35.530 --> 42:37.259
AND I THREW THOSE FORMS
IN THE TRASH.

42:37.260 --> 42:38.989
I'LL CALL THE SERVICE
OFF RIGHT NOW.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.298
HE KEPT SAUDI ARABIAN CANDY
FOR 10 YEARS.

42:41.300 --> 42:42.995
YOU JUST WANT TO
JACK UP YOUR PRICE.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.524
NO, IT'S PAID FOR.

42:44.530 --> 42:48.091
I JUST WANT YOUR BROTHER
TO HAVE THE FUNERAL
HE WANTED FOR HIMSELF

42:48.100 --> 42:49.852
BECAUSE THAT'S
HIS RIGHT.

42:49.860 --> 42:52.920
VICTOR WANTED TO BELIEVE
HE DIED FOR SOMETHING,

42:52.930 --> 42:54.693
YOU REALLY WANNA
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HIM ?

42:58.960 --> 43:00.291
JESUS.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.424
HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I HAD LEFT.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.397
AND HE CAN'T EVEN TELL ME
WHAT HE WANTS WHEN HE'S DEAD ?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.989
HE THOUGHT I WOULD'VE
TALKED HIM OUT OF THIS.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.798
AND HE'S RIGHT,
I WOULD'VE.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.225
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT WITH HIS FRIENDS ?

43:36.500 --> 43:38.127
( male )
GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

43:51.230 --> 43:53.391
( loud clock ticking )

44:10.430 --> 44:11.658
WHERE IS RUTH ?

44:11.660 --> 44:12.820
SHE'S IN THE BACK.

44:12.830 --> 44:14.889
CRYING.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.523
( sobbing )

44:26.460 --> 44:27.825
WHAT IS WRONG ?

44:27.830 --> 44:31.220
IT'S THE SMELL
OF THE FLOWERS.

44:31.230 --> 44:32.993
YOU'LL GET
USED TO IT.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.752
I AM USED TO IT !

44:34.760 --> 44:39.788
TODAY I HELPED PEOPLE
CHOOSE FLOWERS FOR WEDDINGS,

44:39.800 --> 44:41.153
FOR AN NIVERSARI ES,

44:41.160 --> 44:43.355
FOR NEW BABIES.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.421
I CAN'T REMEMBER
BEING SURROUNDED
BY SO MUCH HAPPINESS.

44:47.430 --> 44:49.819
I'M USED TO
THE SMELL OF FLOWERS

44:49.830 --> 44:52.321
MEANING SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

44:52.330 --> 44:55.788
I'M USED TO PEOPLE CRYING
AND BEING EXHAUSTED.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.893
PEOPLE BEING
SHATTERED !

44:58.900 --> 45:00.049
DO NOT WORRY.

45:00.060 --> 45:02.221
WE GET
FUNERALS TOO.

45:03.860 --> 45:07.352
I'M SO HAPPY, I CAN'T WAIT
TO COME BACK TOMORROW.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.326
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THIS
EVERYDAY THOUGH, RIGHT ?

45:20.860 --> 45:36.993
( bugle playing "Taps" )

45:59.130 --> 46:01.849
THIS FLAG IS PRESENTED
ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL NATION

46:01.860 --> 46:03.521
AS A TOKEN
OF OUR APPRECIATION

46:03.530 --> 46:05.555
FOR HONORABLE
AND FAITHFUL SERVICES

46:05.560 --> 46:07.357
RENDERED BY
YOUR LOVED ONE.

46:22.730 --> 46:25.290
GIVE IT
TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.

46:49.460 --> 46:51.451
I LOVE YOU,
DAVID.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.519
I ALWAYS WILL.

46:57.830 --> 47:00.025
I COULD GET HIT BY A BUS ON
THE WAY TO THE DESERT TONIGHT.

47:00.030 --> 47:02.828
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU KNEW THAT.

47:06.630 --> 47:08.257
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

47:11.630 --> 47:13.552
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING TODAY.

47:13.560 --> 47:16.324
I KNOW, FEELS KINDA GOOD,
DOESN'T IT ?

47:33.260 --> 47:35.592
HELLO.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.794
SHE CAN'T GO.

47:36.800 --> 47:39.496
WHY NOT ?

47:39.500 --> 47:43.220
SHE HAS TO HELP ME
PICK PRINTS FOR MY SHOW.

47:43.230 --> 47:44.458
DOES SHE HAVE TO
DO IT TONIGHT ?

47:44.460 --> 47:45.791
YES, SHE HAS TO
DO IT TONIGHT.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.121
BILLY'S GOT A SHOW COMING UP
AT A GALLERY IN WESTWOOD.

47:50.860 --> 47:54.296
SOMETIMES SHE GIVES ME HER EYES
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I GO BLIND.

47:56.330 --> 47:58.628
46 HOURS I'VE BEEN
LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES

47:58.630 --> 48:00.825
AND SOMETIMES I SEE
AMAZING THINGS,

48:00.830 --> 48:03.298
AND SOMETIMES
I JUST SEE SHAPES

48:03.300 --> 48:06.121
AND THAT'S WHEN
I GO BLIND.

48:06.360 --> 48:09.955
BECAUSE WHAT IF I LOST THE
ABILITY TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE ?

48:09.960 --> 48:12.224
FOR REAL ?

48:12.230 --> 48:13.993
FOR GOOD ?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.490
YOU WON'T.

48:15.500 --> 48:16.990
YOU SAY THAT AND THEN
YOU GIVE ME YOUR EYES.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.753
BUT WHAT IF ONE DAY
I CAN'T GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU ?

48:19.760 --> 48:22.399
WELL, THAT WON'T HAPPEN,
WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

48:28.100 --> 48:29.795
AH, GOD,
THIS IS CRAP !

48:29.800 --> 48:32.849
THIS IS PRETENTIOUS,
DERIVATIVE CRAP !

48:32.860 --> 48:35.693
THEN THAT'S ONE LESS
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER.

48:35.700 --> 48:36.951
RIGHT ?

48:38.700 --> 48:40.224
RIGHT.

48:43.060 --> 48:46.848
BILLY, I'M GONNA TALK
TO NATE ON THE PORCH, OKAY ?

48:46.860 --> 48:49.124
THEN HE'S GONNA
GO AWAY.

48:49.130 --> 48:51.621
WE'LL BE
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

48:51.630 --> 48:54.292
PICK OUT
FIVE YOU LIKE

48:54.300 --> 48:56.450
AND YOU CAN SHOW 'EM TO ME
WHEN I COME BACK.

48:56.460 --> 48:57.449
ONLY FIVE ?

48:57.460 --> 48:59.325
OR 10, OR 20.

48:59.330 --> 49:02.595
AND I'LL LOOK AT THEM
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SEE.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.851
OKAY.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.722
YOU CAN FUCK HER
SOME OTHER TIME.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.829
SORRY.

49:26.830 --> 49:28.491
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
OFF HIS MEDS.

49:28.500 --> 49:29.694
INTENTIONALLY ?

49:29.700 --> 49:31.588
NO, IT HAPPENS
OCCASIONALLY.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.726
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

49:32.730 --> 49:34.755
BRENDA, COME ON.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.250
SORRY, NATE,
I CAN'T.

49:36.260 --> 49:39.923
I'M ALL HE HAS
WHEN HE'S LIKE THIS.

49:39.930 --> 49:41.898
YOU ARE LETTING HIM
MANIPULATE YOU.

49:41.900 --> 49:43.219
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.050
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

49:45.060 --> 49:46.425
I KNOW
HE DIDN'T LIKE ME,

49:46.430 --> 49:48.250
AND I HAVE A FEELING
HE DOESN'T LIKE
ANY MAN IN YOUR LIFE.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.818
AM I RIGHT ?

49:49.830 --> 49:51.252
ANSWER ME !

49:51.260 --> 49:53.057
WHAT, YOU THINK
I FUCKED MY BROTHER ?

49:53.060 --> 49:55.893
JESUS, I NEVER
SAID THAT.

49:55.900 --> 49:57.253
NATE, HE'S SICK !

49:57.260 --> 49:59.490
HE'S MY BROTHER
AND HE'S SICK !

49:59.500 --> 50:00.899
AND HE NEEDS ME.

50:00.900 --> 50:03.528
THIS IS WHO I AM,
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.853
FUCK YOU.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.593
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
I WANTED TO GO WITH YOU.

50:18.230 --> 50:20.994
CAN I DO ANYTHING
TO HELP ?

50:21.000 --> 50:24.356
YEAH, YOU CAN
GO TO THE DESERT

50:24.360 --> 50:27.921
AND SIT IN MUD AND RELAX
AND FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.

50:27.930 --> 50:30.649
INCLUDING US.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.489
AH, SHIT.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.355
JUST GO, OKAY ?
GODDAMNIT.

50:47.900 --> 50:50.027
