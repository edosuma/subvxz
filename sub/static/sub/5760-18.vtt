<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.143 --> 00:13.143
<i>I just got married,</i>

00:13.277 --> 00:14.667
<i>just moved to a small town.</i>

00:14.854 --> 00:16.454
<i>Just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:16.993 --> 00:18.293
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:19.858 --> 00:21.748
<i>Except for the time that I was a little girl,</i>

00:21.749 --> 00:23.649
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.193
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:26.194 --> 00:28.594
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.</i>

00:28.703 --> 00:32.280
<i>The ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living.</i>

00:32.280 --> 00:33.782
<i>And they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:36.263
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

00:36.823 --> 00:38.177
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:48.268 --> 00:49.168
Did I win?

00:49.318 --> 00:51.256
Actually, I think you broke the record.

00:51.257 --> 00:53.082
- Ah!
- Pick anyone you want.

00:55.815 --> 00:56.815
How 'bout this one?

00:59.146 --> 00:59.884
Okay.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.646
Giant stuffed octopus, or sparkly bracelets.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.040
Since you're not six-years-old, I would say sparkly bracelet.

01:06.518 --> 01:08.018
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:08.165 --> 01:10.615
Wow, where'd you learn to shoot like that, Tess?

01:11.570 --> 01:12.528
I don't know.

01:12.652 --> 01:14.322
Maybe it's genetic or something.

01:14.681 --> 01:17.147
Note to self, never have gunfight with Andrea.

01:26.172 --> 01:27.904
I love carnivals. Feel like a kid.

01:27.905 --> 01:29.053
Get we have cotton candy?

01:29.054 --> 01:32.595
Yeah, but don't come crying to me when you get sick on the tilt-a-whirl.

01:32.596 --> 01:33.757
When I was a kid,

01:34.413 --> 01:37.669
my brother would always drag me into the haunted house, try to scare me,

01:37.670 --> 01:41.048
but then he would get terrified, and start crying, we'd have to leave.

01:41.049 --> 01:43.580
- It was so satisfying.
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

01:43.581 --> 01:46.731
- Here's your chance to dunk a paramedic!
- Enough brew, Jim!

01:46.909 --> 01:48.363
Yup, it's for a good cause.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.185
For a good cause. C'mon, ladies.

01:52.417 --> 01:53.946
I hope for Jim's sake, that water's not cold.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.748
Oh, he'll live.

01:54.749 --> 01:57.410
Dulischner's show starts in five minutes. We have to get in there.

01:57.411 --> 01:59.332
I had to thumb-wrestle an eight-year-old to get these tickets.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.576
I'll get the seats, you get the cotton candy.

02:01.577 --> 02:02.863
- Okay, blue?
- Pink!

02:03.078 --> 02:04.540
- Okay.
- Pink, pink, pink.

02:04.835 --> 02:05.735
Ticket.

02:10.026 --> 02:10.926
Can you, in fact,

02:12.849 --> 02:14.142
trust your senses?

02:14.611 --> 02:15.768
Is what you see

02:16.462 --> 02:17.362
an illusion?

02:21.460 --> 02:22.610
Because not everything

02:22.789 --> 02:23.689
is what it seems.

02:26.423 --> 02:27.323
Thank you.

02:27.343 --> 02:28.243
And you,

02:28.544 --> 02:29.844
even though you are late,

02:30.145 --> 02:31.378
you're so beautiful,

02:32.049 --> 02:33.549
I have a little gift for you.

02:40.402 --> 02:41.952
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

02:42.483 --> 02:43.835
my lovely assistant Vera.

02:44.138 --> 02:45.706
Will climb into this box.

02:46.818 --> 02:47.718
And I

02:47.997 --> 02:49.369
will slice her in half,

02:50.472 --> 02:51.638
with this saw.

02:58.039 --> 03:01.289
This is the part that always freaked my brother out, completely.

03:41.424 --> 03:42.674
Is something the matter?

03:46.324 --> 03:47.324
What have you done?

03:51.215 --> 03:52.115
Oh, no!

03:57.348 --> 03:59.630
- Ambrose!
- What did you do to me?

04:00.000 --> 04:00.900
Stop!

04:02.317 --> 04:03.217
Stop!

04:37.500 --> 04:41.500

04:45.090 --> 04:46.198
How are you feeling?

04:47.171 --> 04:48.071
I'm feeling fine.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.980
You're gonna be okay.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.633
If you need anything, let us know.

04:54.413 --> 04:55.613
Thank you both so much.

04:55.685 --> 04:56.706
She's gonna be okay.

04:56.707 --> 04:58.657
It's a superficial wound, no stitches.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.681
We're just gonna go back to the booth.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.140
Bobby.

05:03.755 --> 05:05.078
Bye guys, see you later.

05:09.635 --> 05:11.035
I can't believe I hurt you.

05:11.201 --> 05:14.501
I'm okay. You've done that trick dozens of times before, Ambrose.

05:14.875 --> 05:15.775
What happened?

05:19.088 --> 05:19.988
I don't know.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.420
I, uh...

05:24.287 --> 05:25.532
the saw, it was so

05:26.457 --> 05:27.380
heavy, and I...

05:27.926 --> 05:28.826
I don't know.

05:29.784 --> 05:31.387
Like I couldn't control it.

05:33.577 --> 05:34.485
You all right?

05:40.739 --> 05:41.639
I don't know.

05:45.492 --> 05:47.072
Melinda, what did you see?

05:47.803 --> 05:50.403
Something not good, but that saw did not just slip.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.096
Let's go this way.

06:05.519 --> 06:07.046
Hey, Tess, over here.

06:21.929 --> 06:22.829
Go away.

06:26.420 --> 06:30.225
- There are a lot of unhappy spirits here.
- Why?

06:30.614 --> 06:34.522
A lot of people met their maker working at this carnival,

06:34.868 --> 06:38.077
but nobody ever wants to leave.

06:39.359 --> 06:40.259
Why not?

06:40.304 --> 06:44.563
The carnival was the only place that would take us in life.

06:45.794 --> 06:49.295
Who else would have us in death?

06:52.774 --> 06:53.674
Hey.

06:55.575 --> 06:56.475
W hat...

06:58.349 --> 06:59.249
what is it?

06:59.871 --> 07:03.863
Well, I guess whoever joins the carnival, stays with the carnival forever.

07:11.438 --> 07:11.987
Come on.

07:11.988 --> 07:15.445
Come on, it's for a good cause. Come on, people. Come on, Mitchell, you weakling.

07:15.446 --> 07:17.660
Come on, right there, right there, you're gonna miss it.

07:17.661 --> 07:20.061
- Do you think she's gonna be ok?
- I hope so.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.390
He's not gonna get anything.

07:37.268 --> 07:38.168
Jim?

07:41.804 --> 07:44.554
Whoo! Man! Would warm water have been too much to ask?

07:48.069 --> 07:50.499
I know, baby, it's for a good cause, but you scared me.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.200
It would've been just as good a cause if they'd dunked me into a jacuzzi.

07:54.366 --> 07:55.316
How you two doing?

07:55.863 --> 07:57.970
- Good, we're great.
- I'm fine.

07:59.023 --> 07:59.988
I'm fine, I just

08:00.507 --> 08:02.657
need to eat. Whoo! Funnel cake, want some?

08:02.728 --> 08:04.529
- Yeah. Sound good.
- Bring two.

08:07.813 --> 08:09.758
Why are these so good?

08:10.398 --> 08:12.311
It's just like fried dough and sugar.

08:12.665 --> 08:14.165
Yes, that's why it's so good.

08:14.343 --> 08:16.943
Mmm, nutritious too. Full of vitamins and minerals.

08:17.007 --> 08:18.107
Probably one of each.

09:10.368 --> 09:11.968
Let's go get our fortunes told.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.068
Okay.

09:23.490 --> 09:25.690
- Hello?
- You're welcome fortune seekers.

09:26.591 --> 09:28.044
- You wanna go first?
- Sure.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.395
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

09:32.218 --> 09:33.366
Hello, I'm Lillia.

09:33.891 --> 09:34.991
Sorry about the wait.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.559
So,

09:36.619 --> 09:39.669
- you're here to have your fortune told.
- You are psychic.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.370
What? You know what,

09:42.822 --> 09:46.667
it's just the last time I had my fortune read, she said that I would be married

09:46.668 --> 09:49.644
by the end of the year, and that was 1999, and, hmm?

09:50.101 --> 09:53.151
People are so often mislead by phony or inaccurate readings.

09:53.763 --> 09:56.913
When something doesn't come true, they're always disappointed.

09:57.732 --> 09:58.829
Or relieved.

09:59.529 --> 10:02.729
Would you like me to read your palm? Or do you prefer hypnosis?

10:02.898 --> 10:05.976
Not hypnosis, I have visions. Walk like a Jim, so,

10:07.041 --> 10:08.036
- palm?
- Right.

10:09.965 --> 10:10.865
Okay,

10:11.133 --> 10:13.383
- first tell me your name.
- Andrea Moreno.

10:14.170 --> 10:17.012
Oh, you are a woman with many interests, Andrea.

10:18.270 --> 10:19.363
A bit unfocused, but

10:19.833 --> 10:20.737
dedicated.

10:21.551 --> 10:25.351
Extremely loyal in your friendships. And you have a very strong money-line.

10:25.486 --> 10:27.170
You have good financial instincts.

10:27.171 --> 10:28.921
Can you fax that to my accountant?

10:29.326 --> 10:30.776
You've been in love, before.

10:32.245 --> 10:33.145
Someone tall.

10:33.908 --> 10:34.808
Green eyes.

10:35.639 --> 10:36.539
Um...

10:37.412 --> 10:38.312
yeah.

10:41.937 --> 10:42.891
He blindsided you.

10:45.338 --> 10:46.438
But that's all right.

10:46.549 --> 10:48.399
You weren't supposed to be with him.

10:48.421 --> 10:49.821
You knew that in you heart.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.917
He, uh, he may have left you, but he did you a big favor.

10:54.919 --> 10:57.769
You've since gone through many transitions in your life.

10:59.764 --> 11:00.664
I'll say.

11:02.938 --> 11:05.688
No, there's still more to come. Many lessons to learn.

11:08.941 --> 11:11.010
- Do you have a brother?
- Yeah.

11:13.184 --> 11:14.395
- Um...
- what?

11:16.230 --> 11:17.130
I see

11:17.283 --> 11:18.183
tears.

11:19.505 --> 11:20.405
Pain.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.598
- You getting all that from her palm?
- No, no, this is from her...

11:26.491 --> 11:28.391
there are certain things I just feel.

11:29.071 --> 11:30.323
When I'm around certain people,

11:30.324 --> 11:32.924
I sense things, it's really hard to explain.

11:33.505 --> 11:34.405
I understand.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.974
Something going to happen to my brother?

11:36.975 --> 11:39.725
It's probably not serious. I'm sorry if I alarmed you.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.450
Wait, wait a minute.

11:41.606 --> 11:42.656
Can you check again?

11:44.374 --> 11:45.274
I'm sorry.

11:46.799 --> 11:48.972
I think I need...

11:50.651 --> 11:51.851
Little short of breath.

11:54.731 --> 11:56.481
You should come back another time.

11:56.945 --> 11:58.145
I'll make it up to you.

11:58.557 --> 11:59.940
Wait, are you okay?

12:01.155 --> 12:03.505
Actually, I'm a little short of breath myself.

12:04.135 --> 12:05.186
Melinda?

12:07.553 --> 12:08.253
You should go,

12:08.254 --> 12:09.154
go now.

12:09.622 --> 12:10.522
What's happening?

12:10.718 --> 12:12.968
I think we should get out of here right now.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.043
I can't breathe.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.680
- Melinda.
- The door's stuck. It won't open.

12:21.332 --> 12:23.045
- We had to get out of here.
- This way.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.346
No there's nothing there.

12:24.562 --> 12:26.512
- That's the only door.
- The window.

12:28.870 --> 12:30.920
No, I can't... I can't go on the window.

12:31.332 --> 12:33.479
I'll go first, okay, then you can jump.

12:35.352 --> 12:37.252
Come on, this place is falling apart.

12:51.724 --> 12:52.624
You see me?

12:52.873 --> 12:56.023
Why are you doing this? What do you have against the carnival?

12:56.379 --> 12:57.279
It's her.

12:58.461 --> 12:59.414
It's the witch!

13:03.764 --> 13:04.664
Are you okay?

13:15.839 --> 13:16.939
Yeah, you were lucky.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.563
You know, we've had more emergencies

13:19.889 --> 13:23.289
at this carnival than we've had in grandview in the last two weeks?

13:23.889 --> 13:25.389
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

13:26.568 --> 13:27.820
Tell me again what happened?

13:27.821 --> 13:29.221
It was the strangest thing,

13:29.354 --> 13:31.504
all of a suden, it was like an earthquake.

13:32.318 --> 13:34.668
Lie down for a while, I'm sure you'll be fine.

13:34.682 --> 13:35.849
Is everything all right?

13:35.850 --> 13:37.052
I heard there was another accident.

13:37.053 --> 13:39.603
- Yeah, everything is fine.
- Over here, Ambrose.

13:41.645 --> 13:42.545
Lillia.

13:43.276 --> 13:44.326
She's gonna be fine.

13:45.455 --> 13:48.355
- Who are those people?
- I don't know, I just met them.

13:56.671 --> 13:58.171
The whole time I felt this...

13:58.433 --> 14:01.321
this pressure. Like there was a cinderblock on my heart.

14:01.890 --> 14:05.038
I could tell that Lillia felt the same way. This ghost is intense.

14:05.039 --> 14:05.939
Sounds like it.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.587
I have to find him again before he hurts Lillia.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.400
It's strange 'cause she seems so fragile.

14:11.530 --> 14:12.473
Seems fragile.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.838
Remember, you don't know anything about this girl.

14:14.839 --> 14:17.379
I feel a connection with her, you know, both of us

14:17.380 --> 14:19.580
having gifts and not everybody understands.

14:19.941 --> 14:22.991
That's a traveling carnival. You don't have to get involved.

14:26.687 --> 14:28.487
Right, like you would ever do that.

14:30.894 --> 14:32.044
Like you would either.

14:34.492 --> 14:37.549
<i>I know you actually feels better, just take it easy anyway.</i>

14:38.276 --> 14:39.176
<i>I promise.</i>

14:41.013 --> 14:41.913
All right,

14:42.198 --> 14:43.049
remember.

14:43.050 --> 14:43.950
Any trouble.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.475
Send up the bat signal.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.881
- Be safe.
- You too.

15:08.947 --> 15:09.847
Come in.

15:10.096 --> 15:10.996
Lillia?

15:11.521 --> 15:13.511
Hi. It's Melinda Gordon from yesterday.

15:14.233 --> 15:16.437
It's nice of you to come back, but there's no need.

15:16.438 --> 15:18.538
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.275
Can I do a reading for you?

15:21.371 --> 15:24.571
It's the least I could do to repay you for your help yesterday.

15:24.705 --> 15:25.605
Okay.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.214
Now, these are oracle cards.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.460
Please pick eight cards.

15:36.396 --> 15:37.696
But don't turn them over.

16:14.786 --> 16:15.736
Well... you, um...

16:20.488 --> 16:21.838
You've been lucky in love.

16:27.326 --> 16:28.226
But...

16:29.981 --> 16:31.041
you shoulder some

16:31.674 --> 16:32.574
heavy burdens.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.717
Do you have a big family?

16:36.084 --> 16:37.584
A lot of people you care for?

16:39.017 --> 16:40.267
In a manner of speaking.

16:41.051 --> 16:44.601
Yeah, the saints used to characterize their burdens as gifts from God.

16:46.707 --> 16:48.787
Now this card here, you...

16:49.759 --> 16:51.859
you have a level of consciousness that...

16:52.237 --> 16:54.037
that goes beyond the earthly plane.

16:56.561 --> 16:58.473
Have you ever had psychic visions?

16:59.239 --> 17:01.215
No, not like you do, anyway.

17:03.928 --> 17:06.578
Psychic visions aren't all they're cracked up to be.

17:08.006 --> 17:09.656
My family thought I was a freak.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.489
They were very strict. They didn't understand what I could do.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.840
Yeah, I know the feeling.

17:19.040 --> 17:19.940
You do.

17:22.094 --> 17:22.993
I can tell.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.560
You're a very empathetic person.

17:29.075 --> 17:30.725
I can communicate with the dead.

17:32.091 --> 17:33.491
See them and speak to them.

17:35.089 --> 17:38.289
And my gift is to help them, because I'm the only one that can.

17:42.573 --> 17:45.473
Are you saying that you saw someone here at the carnival?

17:45.755 --> 17:46.655
Here with you

17:47.358 --> 17:48.258
last night.

17:48.892 --> 17:51.740
He was also at the magician Ambrose's show earlier.

17:52.386 --> 17:54.586
He's in his 30s. He's dressed all in black.

17:55.594 --> 17:58.094
When I see him I can hear the rattling of chains,

17:58.427 --> 18:00.651
and its hard for me to catch my breath, you know?

18:00.652 --> 18:02.252
Almost like he can't catch his.

18:05.962 --> 18:09.512
You know who he is, don't you? Do you know why he might still be here?

18:09.532 --> 18:11.782
Do you know why he's here with us right now?

18:24.333 --> 18:25.233
No.

18:25.576 --> 18:27.176
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I--

18:27.699 --> 18:28.599
I have to leave.

18:35.952 --> 18:37.752
Why doesn't she wanna speak to you?

18:38.172 --> 18:39.122
She and my brother

18:40.704 --> 18:41.604
killed me.

18:51.929 --> 18:54.162
- Five? Ten? Cool.
- Five.

19:03.182 --> 19:05.082
Ambrose the magician is your brother?

19:05.388 --> 19:06.288
Yes.

19:06.996 --> 19:08.211
And a fine brother too.

19:09.437 --> 19:10.537
Until he betrayed me.

19:11.661 --> 19:12.807
Do you know when you died?

19:12.808 --> 19:15.158
Just after the carnival went back on the road.

19:15.666 --> 19:17.666
We always go back on the road in april.

19:17.983 --> 19:19.333
That was three months ago.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.643
If you say so.

19:21.236 --> 19:22.136
Feels like

19:22.881 --> 19:23.781
yesterday.

19:24.949 --> 19:26.399
I might be able to help you.

19:27.662 --> 19:30.012
All of you, if you just tell me what happened.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.790
I was this carnival's main attraction.

19:34.516 --> 19:37.916
<i>Like every magicians, I took my inspiration from the great Houdini.</i>

19:38.148 --> 19:41.848
<i>And my younger brother wanted nothing else but to follow in my footsteps.</i>

19:42.040 --> 19:44.600
He had the technique, but not the soul.

19:46.156 --> 19:47.056
And Lillia?

19:49.765 --> 19:52.365
Lillia was the most beautiful girl in the carnival.

19:53.019 --> 19:55.119
<i>She joined up with us outside Chicago.</i>

19:55.331 --> 19:57.831
<i>Running from a family she would never talk about.</i>

19:57.870 --> 20:00.720
<i>The moment I laid eyes on her, I know I had to have her.</i>

20:00.760 --> 20:03.110
<i>I did everything in my power to make her mine.</i>

20:03.351 --> 20:05.151
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about her.</i>

20:06.025 --> 20:08.675
<i>I became so obsessed with her that my work suffered.</i>

20:08.834 --> 20:12.266
<i>As painful as it was for both of us, I know I had to keep her at arms length.</i>

20:12.267 --> 20:15.721
<i>She never understood, when we were together we fought about not being together.</i>

20:15.722 --> 20:16.917
Perfecting my act.

20:17.279 --> 20:18.376
Redesigning my act.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.967
Making it more challenging, more extraordinary. That was my priority.

20:23.827 --> 20:25.577
It didn't leave much time for her.

20:26.704 --> 20:31.004
<i>But then one day I saw them together and I watched the way they looked at each other.</i>

20:31.147 --> 20:32.647
<i>The way he caressed her face.</i>

20:34.120 --> 20:37.142
<i>The way she walked into his arms and they held each other like lovers and</i>

20:37.143 --> 20:39.193
<i>I felt like my heart was tearing in two.</i>

20:40.003 --> 20:43.582
The thought of losing her. Nothing else was important.

20:44.790 --> 20:47.140
I knew that from now on she had to come first,

20:48.225 --> 20:51.325
<i>At that moment I wanted to thank Ambrose for opening my eyes</i>

20:51.386 --> 20:54.636
<i>They took scenes together make me realized how much I loved her.</i>

20:56.511 --> 20:58.861
<i>How stupid I was not to have seen the deceipt.</i>

20:59.694 --> 21:01.842
<i>Then as if to mark me, on the day I died</i>

21:01.921 --> 21:04.668
<i>she read my cards for me and warned me of great danger.</i>

21:04.669 --> 21:06.491
<i>Of course she knew, I wouldn't listen.</i>

21:06.492 --> 21:08.892
<i>Why else would she go through with the charade?</i>

21:09.568 --> 21:10.468
<i>The perfect plan.</i>

21:10.950 --> 21:14.329
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Edward the great, master of illusions</i>

21:14.731 --> 21:17.381
<i>will now attempt to escape from the chains of death,</i>

21:17.594 --> 21:20.167
<i>shackled with 50 additional pounds of lead weight.</i>

21:20.580 --> 21:23.164
<i>Submerged in a tomb of water.</i>

21:26.843 --> 21:27.743
Start the clock!

21:31.127 --> 21:34.168
<i>I knew the instant I ran my tongue accross the key into my mouth</i>

21:34.169 --> 21:35.971
<i>- that something was wrong.
- Five minutes!</i>

21:35.972 --> 21:38.172
<i>I've done this illusion thousands of times.</i>

21:39.569 --> 21:41.669
<i>Then I was their faces through the glass.</i>

21:42.320 --> 21:45.578
<i>They didn't looked at me, their eyes glued to the floor.</i>

21:46.435 --> 21:50.685
<i>They knew the key wouldn't fit the lock, and they were waiting for me to realize it.</i>

21:51.370 --> 21:53.770
<i>I was trapped in an illusion I couldn't escape.</i>

21:54.173 --> 21:57.046
<i>I could hear the bubbles in my heart pounding in my ears.</i>

21:57.047 --> 21:58.677
<i>I couldn't think, I panicked.</i>

22:00.482 --> 22:03.282
<i>I wanted to reach out and grab her, scream at her, why?</i>

22:03.647 --> 22:07.454
<i>I wanted her to save me, I couldn't hold my breath any longer.</i>

22:08.589 --> 22:11.693
<i>My lungs filled with water, and I felt this release.</i>

22:12.473 --> 22:13.695
<i>- Edward.
- Then</i>

22:14.933 --> 22:15.833
<i>it was over.</i>

22:18.386 --> 22:19.636
Are you sure about this?

22:20.802 --> 22:22.902
Couldn't there be some other explanation?

22:23.209 --> 22:25.309
There's no margin for error in what I do.

22:25.812 --> 22:29.676
It just seems so extreme. If they were in love, why wouldn't they just tell you?

22:29.677 --> 22:30.877
There's more than that.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.800
My brother Ambrose hated being in my shadow.

22:34.121 --> 22:37.271
With me gone, he could have Lillia and he could take my place.

22:37.404 --> 22:38.304
Your own brother.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.790
I never thought it possible.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.469
I tried to teach him, to protect him.

22:43.810 --> 22:47.160
But the last thing I saw was Ambrose's face. The look in his eyes.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.330
He just stood there not even trying to help.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.433
It's not good for you to stay here.

22:54.796 --> 22:58.210
Your feeding your own anger and pain, you need to cross over into the light.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.961
- And what would I find there?
- I'm not sure. Peace?

23:01.949 --> 23:03.649
Understanding, maybe forgiveness.

23:04.355 --> 23:05.268
Not interested.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.780
Please let me help you.

23:06.821 --> 23:09.294
I'll never cross over while their allowed to live and be in love.

23:09.295 --> 23:11.445
They're gonna pay for what they did to me.

23:12.681 --> 23:14.181
That's the only peace I want.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.377
I didn't ask for your help.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.641
Oh, hello, excuse me. Could you co--ooh!

23:48.637 --> 23:49.537
Wow.

23:52.792 --> 23:56.853
Sorry miss, the patrons aren't really supposed to be back here.

23:57.580 --> 24:01.625
Yeah, sorry, I'm just looking for someone. Trying to help a friend with a problem.

24:01.626 --> 24:04.181
We take care of ourselves, understand?

24:07.311 --> 24:09.861
Do you know where I could find Lillia and Ambrose?

24:10.618 --> 24:11.595
Magician's tent.

24:12.331 --> 24:16.531
Last person who stuck his nose in carnival business, ended up face down in a ditch.

24:17.039 --> 24:20.111
Car troubles. Went right through the windshield.

24:31.661 --> 24:32.961
You can do this, Ambrose.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.239
I know you can.

24:35.260 --> 24:36.979
Just stay focused and relaxed.

24:37.860 --> 24:38.860
Okay, you're right.

24:38.927 --> 24:43.077
You just have to believe in it. That's the only difference between you and Edward.

24:43.102 --> 24:44.802
He believed he could do anything.

24:44.938 --> 24:45.838
You're right,

24:46.186 --> 24:47.086
I can do it.

24:54.298 --> 24:55.298
You'll never do it.

24:57.433 --> 24:59.133
You'll never be as good as I was.

24:59.344 --> 25:00.510
So stop trying.

25:32.246 --> 25:33.646
Take him out! Take him out!

25:34.715 --> 25:36.815
Don't save him, let him drown like I did.

25:40.470 --> 25:41.370
I can't do it.

25:44.820 --> 25:46.470
- I couldn't do it.
- You will.

25:47.358 --> 25:50.508
- I'll never be as good as he was.
- That is your punishment.

25:56.236 --> 25:58.686
He didn't need to be attached to a safety cable.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.058
Because he was arrogant, Ambrose.

26:01.389 --> 26:02.491
That's why he's dead.

26:03.984 --> 26:05.584
You have it in you to be great.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.282
Even greater than Edward.

26:08.869 --> 26:10.190
I just wish

26:10.294 --> 26:12.744
you could see yourself, the way that we see you,

26:13.583 --> 26:15.283
not the way your brother saw you.

26:16.423 --> 26:19.623
Just stop talking about it. It's bad luck to speak of the dead.

26:25.467 --> 26:26.717
What are you doing here?

26:27.194 --> 26:30.044
- I just wanna find out the truth.
- Well, there it is.

26:30.054 --> 26:33.104
They're in love, that's the only truth that matters to them.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.409
You oughta know how they broke my heart.

26:42.822 --> 26:45.922
I think we could use a little something to take the edge off.

26:45.957 --> 26:47.037
Thanks, Vera, but

26:48.086 --> 26:49.086
I really shouldn't.

26:50.002 --> 26:51.702
Why? You knocked up or something?

26:56.697 --> 26:57.597
Wait,

26:58.225 --> 26:59.125
you mean...

26:59.671 --> 27:00.571
you're pregnant?

27:07.344 --> 27:10.579
That's what you were telling my husband's partner, you're pregnant.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.530
You were afraid for the baby's safety.

27:13.169 --> 27:14.269
I can't believe this.

27:16.044 --> 27:16.944
Is it true?

27:18.917 --> 27:19.817
Who are you?

27:20.798 --> 27:22.048
What are you doing here?

27:22.603 --> 27:23.953
My name is Melinda Gordon.

27:24.582 --> 27:26.050
I was Lillia in the wagon.

27:26.453 --> 27:29.303
When she had to go out the window, I know what happened.

27:29.392 --> 27:30.292
Why it happened.

27:31.605 --> 27:32.505
Lillia?

27:33.465 --> 27:34.765
What's she talking about?

27:35.867 --> 27:37.767
Can we not do this right now, please?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.450
- Ambrose, let's go.
- What's going on?

27:40.935 --> 27:42.135
I've seen your brother.

27:42.854 --> 27:46.354
I've spoken to him. His spirit is still here. He's with us right now.

27:47.051 --> 27:48.469
Come. Come, please.

27:48.702 --> 27:50.650
Ambrose, let's go. Let's go.

27:57.032 --> 27:58.032
She never loved me.

27:59.463 --> 28:00.763
I'm sure that's not true.

28:43.403 --> 28:44.753
<i>We take care of ourselves.</i>

28:47.289 --> 28:48.588
Damm. My brakes!

29:03.166 --> 29:04.116
Everything's fine.

29:04.885 --> 29:08.534
You're absolutely sure? Run every diagnostic test you can possibly...

29:10.096 --> 29:12.523
okay, no, I hear you, okay. Great.

29:13.527 --> 29:16.877
Thanks a million, Christian. I'll pick it up in the morning, okay?

29:18.402 --> 29:19.302
Car is fine.

29:20.949 --> 29:21.849
I swear

29:22.308 --> 29:23.508
the brakes didn't work.

29:23.700 --> 29:24.600
I believe you.

29:25.165 --> 29:27.515
I also believe the car is fine, which means...

29:27.697 --> 29:29.197
someone's trying to scare me.

29:29.437 --> 29:31.161
Well, they did a pretty good job of scaring me.

29:31.162 --> 29:32.062
I'm sorry.

29:32.441 --> 29:33.341
Don't be, just...

29:34.485 --> 29:35.835
I'll start riding my bike.

29:38.117 --> 29:39.667
This is not a joke, all right?

29:40.672 --> 29:42.812
Look, thrills and chills are one thing, okay?

29:42.813 --> 29:43.913
Yeah, I know, I know.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.461
I guess I just assumed Lillia was innocent.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.428
'Cause we bonded over having a gift.

29:50.982 --> 29:53.132
I guess maybe Edward was right about them.

29:54.141 --> 29:55.791
Not everything is what it seems.

29:56.675 --> 29:59.664
I have to try and get Ambrose to tell me the truth. That's the only way

29:59.665 --> 30:01.915
that Edward will get closure and cross over.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.616
- Be careful.
- I always am.

30:11.305 --> 30:12.205
All right.

30:18.101 --> 30:19.801
Your husband loves you very much.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.622
I never loved anyone that well.

30:27.623 --> 30:28.723
And now I never will.

31:05.775 --> 31:06.675
- Here.
- Hmm?

31:07.504 --> 31:08.758
- The key.
- Key.

31:23.938 --> 31:24.838
You.

31:30.474 --> 31:31.874
You say you saw my brother.

31:33.089 --> 31:33.989
Yes.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.095
- He's here?
- No, not right now.

31:38.623 --> 31:40.023
But he haunts the carnival.

31:41.038 --> 31:42.138
Because now he knows.

31:42.668 --> 31:43.568
Knows what?

31:46.028 --> 31:48.628
Is there something that you wanna tell me, Ambrose?

32:00.211 --> 32:01.111
Lillia.

32:04.016 --> 32:04.916
No, please stop.

32:09.843 --> 32:11.743
I just need you to tell me the truth.

32:11.913 --> 32:12.834
About what?

32:13.945 --> 32:14.995
Edward's stuck here.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.059
You can help him if you'll just tell him what happened that night.

32:20.060 --> 32:23.310
There's no use in hiding it any longer. He knows about the baby.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.042
But he needs to know the truth about you and Ambrose.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.358
Okay.

32:38.337 --> 32:39.637
I can tell you the truth.

32:43.899 --> 32:44.799
This baby...

32:48.116 --> 32:49.458
it's Edward's.

33:00.237 --> 33:01.537
Edward was my whole life.

33:03.592 --> 33:07.031
I knew that I came in a distant second to his magic, but

33:09.502 --> 33:10.502
I couldn't help it.

33:11.418 --> 33:12.868
<i>Nobody knew the real Edward,</i>

33:13.913 --> 33:14.863
<i>not the way I did.</i>

33:15.801 --> 33:17.540
<i>How driven he was to succeed.</i>

33:19.067 --> 33:20.459
<i>His fear of failure.</i>

33:22.137 --> 33:24.137
<i>The pressure he used to put on himself.</i>

33:25.186 --> 33:27.186
<i>Always trying to top his last illusion.</i>

33:28.470 --> 33:32.720
<i>So when I found out I was pregnant, I thought that maybe a baby could change things.</i>

33:34.138 --> 33:35.838
We fought the night that he died.

33:36.610 --> 33:39.510
I wanted him to know about the baby, I did but I was just

33:39.966 --> 33:41.544
scared. I was scared that

33:42.249 --> 33:44.399
maybe he wouldn't want me to have it or...

33:45.444 --> 33:46.794
so I had to tell somebody.

33:47.802 --> 33:49.188
So I... I told Ambrose.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.829
<i>And he loved his brother.</i>

33:53.019 --> 33:53.919
<i>He was just</i>

33:55.074 --> 33:55.974
<i>afraid of him.</i>

33:57.715 --> 34:00.515
<i>Ambrose told me that I needed to tell Edward the truth.</i>

34:00.648 --> 34:04.088
<i>And I was going to that night after his performance, but...</i>

34:05.969 --> 34:07.544
<i>it's was too late.</i>

34:08.712 --> 34:11.112
- Is everything okay?
- Just part of his show.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.053
No, it's not working!

34:14.246 --> 34:15.147
Edward!

34:24.311 --> 34:25.610
I was just so afraid that

34:26.371 --> 34:28.172
something would happen to the baby.

34:29.822 --> 34:31.929
That my grief would suffocate it.

34:33.442 --> 34:34.784
But I held on.

34:36.592 --> 34:37.493
Then to let go.

34:38.141 --> 34:40.367
The baby has his father's tenacity.

34:41.534 --> 34:42.684
How far along are you?

34:43.279 --> 34:44.179
Five months.

34:45.005 --> 34:45.906
And Ambrose?

34:47.197 --> 34:48.496
Are you in love with him?

34:51.134 --> 34:52.034
Look when,

34:53.755 --> 34:55.606
two people share this kind of grief,

34:57.505 --> 34:58.755
it creates a connection.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.450
I'm sure you see it a lot.

35:03.694 --> 35:06.022
Ambrose is a good man, but

35:07.623 --> 35:09.182
I could never love him

35:10.249 --> 35:11.471
the way I loved Edward.

35:14.897 --> 35:16.297
But why were you so scared?

35:16.795 --> 35:18.495
To know that Edward was with you?

35:18.989 --> 35:20.889
That Edward spirit was following you.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.515
I just thought that he'd blame me

35:23.933 --> 35:25.233
for predicting his death.

35:25.993 --> 35:26.893
But the key.

35:27.451 --> 35:28.951
How did the key get switched?

35:30.320 --> 35:32.520
He's asking about how the key got switched.

35:37.625 --> 35:38.534
I don't know.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.939
But I swear to you it wasn't me.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.114
I know it wasn't you.

35:49.389 --> 35:50.289
Then who?

36:02.059 --> 36:02.959
What's this?

36:03.505 --> 36:04.405
Lillia?

36:05.409 --> 36:06.309
You all right?

36:07.509 --> 36:08.659
I don't know, Ambrose.

36:09.772 --> 36:11.222
Your brother's here with us.

36:11.934 --> 36:14.707
He wants to know what happened. How the key got switched.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.202
- Why, he must've taken the wrong one.
- Impossible.

36:17.203 --> 36:18.503
You know, don't you Vera?

36:19.473 --> 36:20.773
How the key got switched.

36:21.956 --> 36:22.865
Are you insane?

36:26.860 --> 36:28.543
What are you looking at me like that?

36:28.544 --> 36:29.594
Why it got switched.

36:33.460 --> 36:36.560
- Tell them why you switched the key.
- You can't know that.

36:37.708 --> 36:39.958
Is Edward telling you this? How do you know?

36:40.129 --> 36:41.029
I didn't.

36:42.221 --> 36:43.121
Vera.

36:44.956 --> 36:46.143
You killed my brother.

36:50.389 --> 36:51.289
Ambrose, please.

36:53.333 --> 36:56.099
You were never gonna come into your own when he was around,

36:56.100 --> 36:58.650
- he was smothering you.
- Vera, what did you do?

36:58.899 --> 37:01.674
He was terrible to you. He was terrible to all of us.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.691
Do you think anyone shed a tear over his death?

37:04.692 --> 37:05.610
I did, Vera.

37:07.130 --> 37:08.030
He taught me.

37:08.863 --> 37:09.842
He protected me.

37:10.945 --> 37:13.017
I loved him. Lillia loved him.

37:13.102 --> 37:14.402
She's carrying his child.

37:18.536 --> 37:19.843
I love you, Ambrose.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.307
Don't you see?

37:23.411 --> 37:24.311
I just...

37:26.240 --> 37:28.440
I wanted to make all your dreams come true.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.591
I gave that to you.

37:36.863 --> 37:37.813
Is he really here?

37:39.210 --> 37:40.110
Edward?

37:41.415 --> 37:43.765
When he needed you he would make you feel like

37:43.801 --> 37:47.501
the most important person in the world. And he would just throw you away.

37:49.622 --> 37:51.372
Everyone's better off without him!

37:53.382 --> 37:55.532
- Wait, Ambrose, please.
- Ambrose, stop.

37:56.484 --> 37:58.034
Edward doesn't want you to go.

37:58.362 --> 37:59.262
There's no point.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.278
I'm so sorry that you had to hear all that, Edward,

38:04.169 --> 38:06.019
but doesn't it bring you some peace?

38:08.879 --> 38:10.729
What? He thought that we killed him?

38:12.338 --> 38:13.238
I saw it.

38:14.078 --> 38:16.228
I saw it in your eyes when I was drowning.

38:16.914 --> 38:18.583
I thought you wanted it to happen.

38:18.584 --> 38:20.384
He thought you wanted it to happen.

38:20.448 --> 38:21.498
Wanted him to die?

38:23.097 --> 38:23.997
No.

38:25.426 --> 38:26.482
All I ever wanted

38:27.941 --> 38:29.006
was to hear you say,

38:30.265 --> 38:31.173
that I was good.

38:33.493 --> 38:35.543
Instead of all the relentless criticism,

38:37.625 --> 38:39.675
I just wanted to be half as good as you.

38:42.191 --> 38:43.907
I am so sorry, Ambrose.

38:46.331 --> 38:47.531
How did I not see that?

38:48.939 --> 38:49.839
He's so sorry.

38:50.864 --> 38:53.164
He doesn't understand why he didn't see that.

38:53.570 --> 38:56.980
You were always looking behind you. Or around you.

38:57.881 --> 39:00.667
You never saw what was right in front of you.

39:07.359 --> 39:08.259
She's right.

39:09.019 --> 39:10.619
He sees things, he knows things

39:11.435 --> 39:13.385
that he didn't know when he was alive.

39:13.456 --> 39:15.156
And now there's nothing I can do.

39:16.019 --> 39:18.611
- It's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.926
He knows that he mistreated you both.

39:24.122 --> 39:26.072
He didn't know how much you loved him.

39:26.999 --> 39:29.073
I still love you. Edward,

39:30.923 --> 39:31.896
I always will.

39:34.287 --> 39:36.430
He feels like he doesn't deserve your love.

39:36.431 --> 39:38.562
It's not something that you deserve or

39:39.734 --> 39:40.912
don't deserve. It's

39:42.672 --> 39:43.572
what it is.

39:44.896 --> 39:45.796
I love you.

39:46.499 --> 39:48.381
Ambrose loves you and this child,

39:49.398 --> 39:50.907
your child will love you.

39:52.744 --> 39:54.494
If I could have just one more day.

39:55.763 --> 39:56.970
Just a few hours.

40:01.034 --> 40:02.334
I would show both of you.

40:03.210 --> 40:06.210
He wishes that he could have one more day with both of you.

40:06.867 --> 40:09.612
You have a lifetime. This baby.

40:13.094 --> 40:14.463
You'll never be far.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.260
Tell my brother to love Lillia.

40:25.187 --> 40:26.787
Love her the way I never could.

40:28.029 --> 40:28.929
I will.

40:30.368 --> 40:31.268
I will.

40:54.481 --> 40:56.406
Well, I guess the show must go on.

40:57.102 --> 40:59.202
I'm glad Vera decided to turn herself in.

41:00.002 --> 41:01.502
It would've been a spectacle.

41:02.174 --> 41:03.739
Police cars and handcuffs.

41:04.312 --> 41:05.450
Yeah, the perp walk.

41:09.483 --> 41:11.033
Well, that's what it's called.

41:12.161 --> 41:15.692
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the great Ambrose master of illusions</i>

41:15.987 --> 41:18.637
<i>will now attempt to escape from the chains of death,</i>

41:18.799 --> 41:21.509
<i>shackled with 50 additional pounds of lead weight.</i>

41:21.819 --> 41:24.343
