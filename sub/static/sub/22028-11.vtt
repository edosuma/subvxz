We need a face case,
so the three of you are

00:05.580 --> 00:06.830
gonna dig through this mail
until we find one.

00:06.830 --> 00:07.830
Look at his name.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.460
-Nate Lahey.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.080
There's evidence here that links
Antares to your campaign funds.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.540
-I destroyed it.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.170
Because I want to
keep my job here.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.830
Tell me
you found Dominick.

00:17.830 --> 00:21.380
We have a bigger problem --
Bonnie Winterbottom.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.620
Then make the time
for Laurel!

00:22.620 --> 00:25.620
Don't tell me it's about Laurel.
We both know it's not.

00:25.620 --> 00:28.420
Of course it's not!
It was about saving me.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.290
Your mother's files show
a history of mental illness.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.790
Bipolar I.

00:32.790 --> 00:35.460
She was hospitalized until
she was so drugged out

00:35.460 --> 00:38.120
that she was no longer
considered a danger to herself.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.540
Why do you still have
Dominick's phone?

00:41.290 --> 00:42.710
It's Christophe.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.960
Laurel, that's your father.
He's been calling every day.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.210
It's not my father!

00:46.210 --> 00:48.330
Hi, Mom.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.170
-That's not Spanish.
-It's French. Quiet.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.250
...Dominick.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.830
Did she just say
I killed Dominick?

01:15.920 --> 01:17.330
Now's not a good time.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.460
Did you know Nate's dad
has been in jail for 33 years?

01:19.460 --> 01:20.500
Annalise: What?

01:20.500 --> 01:22.210
She didn't know.
See? You owe me 50 bucks.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.420
Connor, explain.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.330
One of the files that came in
is for a 71-year-old

01:25.330 --> 01:26.580
convicted murderer
named Nate Lahey.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.540
Okay, that doesn't mean that
that's Nate's father.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.790
I-I hacked into
his prison records.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.790
The only family member
listed is our Nate.

Nate didn't tell you
any of this?

01:34.420 --> 01:36.170
-No.
-Okay, but why would he put

01:36.170 --> 01:37.670
the file in the mail instead
of just talking to you?

01:41.080 --> 01:42.580
I have to go.

Okay. I know.

Almost everything.

01:58.170 --> 01:59.920
Dominick's like her son.
They talk every day.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.290
He told her that I was pregnant
and that he was coming here

02:02.290 --> 02:03.750
to tell me that my father
already knew.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.670
That's why she kept calling
Dominick's phone,

02:05.670 --> 02:07.750
because she was worried that
something had happened to him.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.210
You have his phone.

That's proof you're the
something that happened to him.

02:10.790 --> 02:12.290
I told her that I found it
in his rental car.

02:12.290 --> 02:13.580
Now she thinks my dad
killed him.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.960
It's a lot, I know,
but she's gonna come here,

02:15.960 --> 02:17.670

02:17.670 --> 02:19.420

02:19.420 --> 02:21.540
-That he's a bad father.

why were you admitted
to a rehab program

11:33.290 --> 11:34.540
when you were

Relevance.

I'm trying to establish
a pattern here, Your Honor.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.830

11:41.580 --> 11:44.460
Dean: Really? Because

11:44.460 --> 11:46.290
show that this was
for cocaine abuse.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.540
I'd only done cocaine
a handful of times

11:48.540 --> 11:50.330
to suppress my appetite.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.420
So you admit that you had
done cocaine in the past

11:53.420 --> 11:55.500

Objection. Argumentative.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.830
Move on, Mr. Dean.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.210
Ms. Castillo, how many men

11:59.210 --> 12:00.880
when you got pregnant?
Objection!

12:00.880 --> 12:03.330
Counsel's question is
tantamount to slut-shaming,

12:03.330 --> 12:06.000

As am I. Sustained.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.420
I'll rephrase.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.000
During your pregnancy,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.880
did you ask for
a paternity test?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.620
I did.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.540
And is this the same reason
you told your father

12:14.540 --> 12:15.920
that you had had
an abortion?

12:15.920 --> 12:17.710
No. I just didn't want him
to react negatively

12:17.710 --> 12:19.620
to the fact that
I was having a child.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.670

having an abortion?

No.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.790
that Laurel exhibited
no signs of drug withdrawal

32:05.790 --> 32:08.460
that would be expected
from a habitual drug user.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.790
She also showed no signs
of depression or self-harm

32:11.790 --> 32:13.920
that would require her
to be hospitalized.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.500
So in your
expert opinion,

32:15.500 --> 32:17.710
is there any reason
why Ms. Castillo

32:17.710 --> 32:20.170
should be deemed unfit
to care for her newborn baby?

32:20.170 --> 32:21.670
None whatsoever.

32:21.670 --> 32:23.790
Thank you, Dr. Roa.

32:23.790 --> 32:25.960
Your witness.

32:27.620 --> 32:32.710
Dr. Roa, your career
as an addiction counselor

32:32.710 --> 32:34.040
started as a result

32:34.040 --> 32:36.120
of your own drug
addiction, correct?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.710
Objection.
Inflammatory.

32:37.710 --> 32:39.750
Goes to his credibility,
Your Honor.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.540
Judge Williams: Overruled.
You may answer.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.290
Yes, Your Honor.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.580
I am a recovering
heroin addict, yes.

32:45.580 --> 32:48.000
I find that it's
one of the things

32:48.000 --> 32:50.210
that best helps me
to empathize

32:50.210 --> 32:52.580
with the struggles
that my patients suffer.

32:52.580 --> 32:55.290
Interesting. Is it also true
that you were investigated

32:55.290 --> 32:57.620
as a person of interest in the
death of your daughter Stella?

32:57.620 --> 32:59.210
Objection.
Dr. Roa's personal life

32:59.210 --> 33:00.750
should not be taken
into account here!

33:00.750 --> 33:02.830
If we are supposed to
trust Dr. Roa's opinion

33:02.830 --> 33:04.670
about a young woman's
mental health,

33:04.670 --> 33:06.580
certainly his actions
regarding his own daughter

33:06.580 --> 33:08.120
speak to
his credibility.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.040
Overruled.
I'll allow it.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.880
Isaac: I was
interviewed briefly.

33:12.880 --> 33:16.500
The police informed me
that it was routine,

33:16.500 --> 33:19.670
and they eventually
determined that she, uh...

33:19.670 --> 33:21.080
committed suicide.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.540
How did she
commit suicide?

33:22.540 --> 33:24.000
Pills.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.830
-Oxycodone.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.380
Which is an opioid,
like heroin.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.750
Is that
a coincidence?

33:31.750 --> 33:33.460
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.000
Let me offer proof.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.620
During the vetting of Dr. Roa,
our investigators uncovered

33:38.620 --> 33:42.120
that Stella Roa had
no history of drug abuse.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.290
She had a history of
mental-health issues.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.830
You claimed that you found her
unconscious when she died,

33:47.830 --> 33:51.290
but the security system shows
that you entered the house

33:51.290 --> 33:54.040
15 minutes before
you called 911.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.460
Now, what elapsed
during that time?

33:55.460 --> 33:57.210
Your Honor, this case has been
closed for several years!

33:57.210 --> 33:59.420
Were you staging
your daughter's su--

33:59.420 --> 34:00.500
Any evidence
from opposing counsel

34:00.500 --> 34:02.250
hasn't been verified yet,
Your Honor.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.330
Not true, Your Honor.
Due to this new evidence,

34:04.330 --> 34:07.750
the D.A.'s office is, in fact,
reopening Stella's case

34:07.750 --> 34:09.330
and investigating
Dr. Roa for murder.

34:09.330 --> 34:11.420
Judge, counsel
has no standing

34:11.420 --> 34:12.750
to speak on behalf
of the D.A.'s office.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.380
We can get the A.D.A.
down here right now.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.080
I'm sure they would love
to ask Dr. Roa --

34:16.080 --> 34:17.750
Sanction Mr. Dean
immediately.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.250
-Mr. Dean, not another word.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.330
-Your Honor!

34:21.330 --> 34:22.540
Mr. Dean --
Were you afraid she
would tell her mother?

34:22.540 --> 34:24.120
One more word, and
I hold you in contempt.

34:27.420 --> 34:29.330
Apologies, Your Honor.

34:29.330 --> 34:33.460
But I beseech the court
to strike Dr. Roa's testimony

34:33.460 --> 34:35.460
from the record as unreliable,

34:35.460 --> 34:38.500
due to his status as a suspect

34:38.500 --> 34:41.210
in an active
homicide investigation.

34:44.210 --> 34:47.460
Is it true? Are they
investigating him?

34:47.460 --> 34:50.170
Denver's personally
overseeing the case.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.500
Of course.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.580
And Jorge's paying the
whole police department
to make it look real.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.170
Unless it is real.

34:57.170 --> 35:00.580
They're framing him,
just like they did me.

35:00.580 --> 35:04.380
I'm just saying, the evidence
they have on him looks real.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.880
I'm the devil.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.500
You didn't cause this.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.540
I begged him to help me.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.250
Stop. All right?

35:20.250 --> 35:23.120
You can't afford to make this
about yourself right now.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.080
Judge has a decision.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.750
Judge Williams: Our research
shows keeping an infant

35:35.750 --> 35:38.120
with their mother is
always the ideal outcome,

35:38.120 --> 35:39.460
and whenever
the evidence allows,

35:39.460 --> 35:40.960
I will come to that conclusion.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.210
But because I must now exclude

35:43.210 --> 35:45.710
any of the evaluations
proffered by Dr. Roa,

35:45.710 --> 35:48.620
I have no expert to corroborate
Ms. Castillo's claim

35:48.620 --> 35:50.750
that she's mentally fit
to care for her child.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.380
Therefore, I have decided
to extend the initial custody

35:53.380 --> 35:55.290
and have the child
remain in the care

35:55.290 --> 35:57.380
of his maternal grandfather.

35:57.380 --> 36:01.000
The petition for custody
is denied.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.790
What about visitation,
Your Honor?

36:02.790 --> 36:05.330
I need to confer with the
Department of Human Services.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.580
After that,
you and your client

36:06.580 --> 36:08.120
will be notified
about a visitation schedule.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.460
Why can't we
do that today?
