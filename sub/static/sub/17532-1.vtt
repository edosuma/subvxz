Subrip by DanDee

02:21.708 --> 02:22.708
Well?

02:24.208 --> 02:26.958
Sir, I just want to come back
and finish my studies.

02:27.833 --> 02:32.626
Being a doctor and serving society
has always been my main goal in life.

02:32.666 --> 02:37.626
I don't want my future destroyed
because of one mistake.

02:37.666 --> 02:38.876
So, do you admit it?

02:38.916 --> 02:40.376
Admit what?

02:40.416 --> 02:42.001
What you've done.

02:43.458 --> 02:47.751
Well, I don't know the
details of my case

02:49.083 --> 02:51.708
but I guess the reason I can't return
is because I was politically active.

02:51.751 --> 02:55.001
But sir, everyone was politically
active during the revolution.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.541
I was young.
Naive.

02:59.583 --> 03:03.251
I mean, I didn't even understand the
difference between left and right.

03:03.291 --> 03:06.166
I was just passionate
like everyone else that age.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.666
I was concerned about the country.
I wanted change.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.001
I'm sure you understand.

03:13.041 --> 03:16.791
If I ended up in one of
those radical left groups...

03:16.833 --> 03:20.208
It was only because
I didn't know any better...

03:22.291 --> 03:25.291
Every mistake has consequences.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.541
I let you in so you could hear this
directly from my lips

03:28.583 --> 03:30.083
and stop wasting your time
by coming here every day.

03:30.126 --> 03:34.208
Let me tell you this frankly.

03:34.251 --> 03:36.501
You cannot continue your studies.

03:36.541 --> 03:39.833
Based on your history, there is
not even the slightest possibility

03:39.876 --> 03:45.083
that you can ever return
to the university.

03:45.126 --> 03:47.501
I suggest you find
a new goal in life.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.916
- Hello, Mrs. Fakur.
- Hello, dear.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.209
Sorry, I'm late.
I hope Dorsa wasn't any trouble?

04:57.251 --> 05:01.001
No trouble at all.
We had fun.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.501
Dorsa! Mum!

05:04.709 --> 05:07.501
- What happened?
- Mummy.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.541
Oh, darling

05:12.041 --> 05:13.166
it's okay.

05:13.209 --> 05:17.292
It's okay. I understand.
That's the climate right now.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.334
Don't let it change you.

05:48.251 --> 05:50.166
To my daughter.

05:50.209 --> 05:52.501
Congratulations
on beginning medical school.

05:52.541 --> 05:55.376
I'm proud of you.
Your loving mother.

06:22.751 --> 06:24.666
Hello? Anyone home?

06:25.916 --> 06:29.041
Dad, dad, dad, dad!

06:29.084 --> 06:32.376
Hello, little one.

06:32.416 --> 06:33.916
Where's mum?

06:36.041 --> 06:38.291
She's in the bedroom.

06:38.334 --> 06:42.751
She's grumpy.

06:49.541 --> 06:50.541
Hello...

06:50.584 --> 06:51.626
Hello...

06:51.666 --> 06:52.833
What are you doing?

06:55.209 --> 06:56.917
Those are my course books.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.501
Give them away to someone
who wants them. Or chuck them.

07:04.751 --> 07:07.291
Go and play Dorsa.

07:10.334 --> 07:12.084
What happened?

07:27.916 --> 07:30.833
Maybe things will get better
after the war.

07:31.459 --> 07:33.251
There's no guarantee.

07:33.959 --> 07:37.167
And this war seems
to be never ending.

07:43.626 --> 07:47.041
Well, you've tried your best.

07:49.376 --> 07:51.876
It's out of your hands now.

07:54.334 --> 07:57.959
Who knows?
It's probably for the best.

08:01.666 --> 08:03.251
Dorsa! Run!

08:07.166 --> 08:09.083
Where are you going?

08:09.791 --> 08:11.126
There is no time,
we have to go downstairs!

08:11.127 --> 08:13.127
We can't leave Kimia behind.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.917
Come on.

08:23.041 --> 08:28.083
Hello.
Hello.

08:28.126 --> 08:29.334
Thank you, Doctor.

08:29.376 --> 08:33.832
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Not at all.

08:38.042 --> 08:42.750
Thank God, sounds like they've put
more defenses around Tehran.

08:42.792 --> 08:48.209
I heard a rumor that Iraq
is launching missiles now...

08:53.583 --> 08:55.583
Leave her alone.

08:55.626 --> 08:58.292
Dorsa,
come here, sweetheart.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.166
Who's this new boy?

09:05.208 --> 09:09.751
Mr. Ebrahimi's nephew. Apparently
he lost his parents in the Abadan.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.417
Dad?

09:22.208 --> 09:24.126
Dad?

09:32.126 --> 09:33.876
Dad?

09:39.833 --> 09:41.541
What happened, sweetheart?

09:42.542 --> 09:44.084
Did you have a bad dream?

09:45.292 --> 09:46.626
It's okay.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.626
No, dear, those things don't exist.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.751
Next time you're scared,
remember that you're not on your own.

09:58.792 --> 10:03.251
I gave you Kimia to keep you company.

10:04.376 --> 10:06.417
Good morning.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.667
No toys at the
breakfast table please.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.251
Good morning.

10:15.292 --> 10:17.792
The tape on the windows
is coming off.

10:17.833 --> 10:21.041
What if the windows
shatter in a blast...

10:21.042 --> 10:24.042
I'll re-tape them.

10:27.876 --> 10:29.876
Did you have a nightmare last night?

10:29.917 --> 10:33.751
She said she heard someone
walking in the house.

10:33.792 --> 10:36.292
You're a bad sleeper
just like your mother.

10:37.626 --> 10:39.376
Did you sleep okay last night?

10:39.417 --> 10:41.292
Me?

10:41.333 --> 10:44.708
Why do you think
I'm sleepwalking again?

10:46.251 --> 10:48.167
You would have noticed.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.292
I was out cold.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.876
Just because I did it once or twice

10:52.917 --> 10:54.751
like six months ago,
doesn't mean it's a constant thing.

10:54.792 --> 10:59.751
Plus this is not the first time Dorsa has
had a nightmare and imagined things.

10:59.792 --> 11:04.501
I'm just saying you're only a
bad sleeper when you're stressed.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.208
What's that?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.584
It's my...

11:11.626 --> 11:13.542
Annual draft notice.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.167
Why didn't you mention it sooner?

11:30.876 --> 11:34.833
You've had other things on your mind.

11:34.876 --> 11:40.292
I'm going to the Ministry of Health
later today to see where I'm stationed.

11:41.042 --> 11:44.834
Might get somewhere safe
like last year...

11:45.917 --> 11:47.501
If we're lucky...

12:43.167 --> 12:44.709
Hey, Doctor.

12:44.751 --> 12:47.001
- A minute please...
- Hello.

12:47.042 --> 12:51.251
- Hello... How is your family?
- Good, thank you.

12:51.292 --> 12:55.209
How many times do I have to ask for
the garage door to be closed properly?

12:55.251 --> 12:59.376
- Please remind your wife...
- What do you mean?

12:59.417 --> 13:01.709
Let me show you.

13:01.751 --> 13:05.042
The bolt has rusted.

13:05.083 --> 13:11.666
- It takes force to put it in place...
- How do you know it was my wife?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.541
It's not you or me.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.291
I know Mr. Fakur closes it properly.

13:15.333 --> 13:19.041
And none of the women in the
building drive, apart from your wife.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.626
Right. We'll remember
to close the door properly.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.251
Have a good day.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.126
Hello.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.458
Hello.

14:00.376 --> 14:02.333
They're sending me to Elam.

14:05.001 --> 14:07.208
That's in the middle of the fighting.

14:09.001 --> 14:12.542
I tried for a safer post
but it didn't work out.

14:14.042 --> 14:18.292
I think you and Dorsa
should go to my parents.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.376
Why?

14:20.251 --> 14:24.667
The rumors about Iraq using
missiles are probably true.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.708
It's safer up North.
People are already leaving the city.

14:27.751 --> 14:29.833
We're fine here.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.834
You don't get a warning
with missiles.

14:32.876 --> 14:35.208
I'm not going to be
a burden to your parents.

14:35.251 --> 14:36.501
You're not a burden.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.584
Last time we went there
your sisters kept saying

14:39.626 --> 14:42.251
"Tehran gets bombed
and we get the shrapnel."

14:42.292 --> 14:45.167
We'll be fine in our own home.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.708
I'm worried about Dorsa.

14:46.751 --> 14:50.917
What? Am I not capable
of looking after my own child now?

14:55.917 --> 14:57.876
That's not what I'm saying.

14:58.876 --> 15:03.167
All I'm saying is I won't be around.

15:03.208 --> 15:07.208
At my parents', you can
at least have that support.

15:07.251 --> 15:11.001
Ah, because you've been so supportive
until now...

15:11.042 --> 15:12.709
That's unfair.

15:12.751 --> 15:20.458
No, unfair is you swanking off to
play doctors and treating me like...

15:20.501 --> 15:22.083
I'm incompetent.

15:22.126 --> 15:24.292
Play doctors?

15:24.333 --> 15:26.251
Being shipped off to
war is not a game.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.251
Are you showing off?
Do you want a medal?

15:29.292 --> 15:31.084
I'm not going out of choice.
I'd lose my right to practice...

15:31.126 --> 15:34.833
If you don't have the right
to practice, it's a catastrophe

15:34.876 --> 15:36.958
but if I don't it's for the best.

15:37.001 --> 15:39.208
Are you mad that I'm practicing?

15:39.251 --> 15:41.208
No, I'm not mad about that...

15:41.251 --> 15:45.958
Dorsa, how many times have I told you
to put your toys away after playing?

16:07.083 --> 16:09.791
Is it my fault
you can't finish your studies?

16:10.792 --> 16:16.292
Didn't you waste your time
on politics at university?

16:16.333 --> 16:19.333
You sound exactly like them.

16:20.042 --> 16:21.876
Am I wrong?

16:23.292 --> 16:30.459
Have you forgotten that you kept calling
me spineless for sticking to my studies?

16:30.501 --> 16:33.251
Like you never tried
to stop me studying.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.917
When did I ever do that?

16:34.958 --> 16:38.251
When the universities reopened
after the Cultural Revolution

16:38.292 --> 16:42.167
who was it that told me studying could
wait, stay home and raise the child?

16:43.667 --> 16:46.334
Do you have a problem
looking after your child?

16:46.376 --> 16:49.833
Are you calling me a bad mother?

16:52.958 --> 16:57.708
No. I'm saying don't blame your
shortcomings on me and our child.

16:57.751 --> 17:01.083
Tell me, why do you want
to go back now, all of a sudden?

17:01.126 --> 17:03.583
I didn't leave out of choice.
The Cultural Revolution happened.

17:03.626 --> 17:07.915
That was four, five years ago.
The universities reopened after a year.

17:07.959 --> 17:08.959
So?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.209
You only want to go back now
because your mother died...

17:12.250 --> 17:14.790
Becoming a doctor has
always been my dream!

17:14.834 --> 17:17.959
No, Shideh, it's your mother's dream.

17:19.459 --> 17:21.416
Dead people can't dream.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.542
I'll be scared without you here.

17:43.334 --> 17:47.709
I'll be back before you know it!

17:52.001 --> 17:56.084
Mum is going to take you to granny's.

18:02.041 --> 18:06.333
Here's this month's rent
and what we owed from last month.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.126
Give it to Ebrahimi
when it's due to shut him up.

18:58.791 --> 19:00.458
Mum...

19:03.291 --> 19:04.541
Mum...

19:07.541 --> 19:08.916
Mum...

19:09.959 --> 19:11.792
Yes?

19:11.834 --> 19:13.792
My bed is wet.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.709
Get up.

19:33.626 --> 19:36.584
You still have to wet yourself
at this age!

19:36.626 --> 19:38.916
Aren't you going to school
next year?

19:40.001 --> 19:41.876
Go to the bathroom,
take your clothes off.

19:44.876 --> 19:46.666
Didn't I say go to the bathroom?

19:49.791 --> 19:52.708
I'm scared to go alone...

19:59.666 --> 20:01.666
Your toast.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.709
Mummy?

20:10.751 --> 20:15.376
Now that dad is not here...
Can I sleep next to you at night?

20:15.416 --> 20:17.501
Aren't you a big girl?

20:17.541 --> 20:19.958
Big girls don't wet the bed either.

20:20.959 --> 20:25.167
Why do you have trouble sleeping?

20:28.834 --> 20:31.501
Well?
Tell me. What are you scared of?

20:32.916 --> 20:34.416
Hey?

20:36.666 --> 20:37.791
Djinn...

20:37.834 --> 20:39.459
Djinn aren't real...

20:39.501 --> 20:42.626
They are. We just can't see them.

20:42.666 --> 20:45.833
- Who told you that?
- Mehdi.

20:45.876 --> 20:47.834
Who's Mehdi?

20:47.876 --> 20:50.834
Sogand and Ali's cousin.

20:51.541 --> 20:57.251
He gave me a ball of magical cat
fur to protect myself from them.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.791
But I lost it.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.584
Drink properly.

21:01.626 --> 21:08.334
Djinn are just a fairytale made
up to scare little children.

21:09.209 --> 21:14.959
Mehdi said Djinn are real.
They're evil and want to hurt us...

21:15.001 --> 21:17.209
Mehdi is talking nonsense.

21:27.959 --> 21:30.167
- Hello, Mrs. Ebrahimi.
- Hello...

21:30.209 --> 21:33.167
- I hope it's not a bad time.
- Not at all. Please come in.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.626
No, thanks. I just
have a small request...

21:36.666 --> 21:38.958
- Your relative...
- Mehdi?

21:39.001 --> 21:42.959
He has been telling scary
stories to my daughter, Dorsa.

21:43.001 --> 21:46.041
I know he's just a child,
it's nothing spiteful

21:46.084 --> 21:49.167
but Dorsa is having real
trouble sleeping at night.

21:49.209 --> 21:54.084
Please ask him not to tell
Dorsa those kind of stories...

21:54.126 --> 21:56.126
Your daughter has made a mistake.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.833
Mehdi is mute.

21:57.876 --> 22:01.541
He hasn't said a word
since he lost his parents.

22:01.584 --> 22:05.167
They both got killed.

22:05.209 --> 22:07.542
Ebrahimi took him
to so many different doctors.

22:07.584 --> 22:09.167
But no result.

22:09.959 --> 22:12.542
- She said Mehdi told her...
- Has she said what stories?

22:12.584 --> 22:16.459
- Djinn and stuff...
- Oh, God, have mercy!

22:16.501 --> 22:19.209
Djinn aren't Mrs. Ebrahimi...

22:19.251 --> 22:22.334
They are very real.
It's even in the Quran.

22:23.751 --> 22:28.501
My husband gets angry when
I say this, but the boy is creepy...

22:33.876 --> 22:37.251
- You're back early.
- Mrs. Ebrahimi sent me back upstairs.

22:40.334 --> 22:41.917
Didn't she say why?

22:43.626 --> 22:47.084
She took Sogand and Ali home
and told me to go home too.

22:53.876 --> 22:55.251
What about Mehdi?

22:55.291 --> 23:00.041
Mehdi's allowed to stay.

23:00.084 --> 23:02.584
But we can't play with him anymore.

23:05.459 --> 23:11.834
You know, the stories you
mentioned this morning...

23:11.876 --> 23:14.291
Are you sure it was Mehdi that told
them to you and not the Ebrahimi kids?

23:14.334 --> 23:20.251
Well, Sogand and Ali
also tell me stories.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.876
Why be careful?

23:21.916 --> 23:24.001
Because they're coming.

23:26.459 --> 23:29.334
Did he say that
in front of the Ebrahimi kids?

23:29.376 --> 23:31.834
No, he whispered it in my ear.

23:35.791 --> 23:40.416
Oh my, we've talked so much.
Your tea is getting cold.

23:40.459 --> 23:42.917
You are right. Sorry.

23:42.959 --> 23:45.792
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

23:46.751 --> 23:50.251
What lovely tea you've made.

23:50.291 --> 23:54.751
I didn't know that you
could make such tasty tea.

23:54.791 --> 23:57.376
Thank you.

23:59.626 --> 24:02.876
- Have some bread too.
- Yes, yes, I will.

24:11.001 --> 24:12.666
Hello?

24:12.709 --> 24:14.959
Hello?

24:15.001 --> 24:17.084
- Shideh?
- Hello.

24:17.126 --> 24:20.459
- Can you hear me?
- The line isn't great but it's okay.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.791
- How are you?
- We're fine. How is it over there?

24:23.834 --> 24:25.042
Not great.

24:25.084 --> 24:28.417
Either working in the hospital
or taking shelter.

24:29.166 --> 24:31.416
You still don't want to go
to my parents?

24:31.459 --> 24:33.459
Don't worry about us.

24:33.501 --> 24:38.959
The foreign radios are saying Iraq claims
they'll level Tehran with missiles soon.

24:39.001 --> 24:41.126
Nothing has been reported here.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.626
Please take Dorsa out of the city.

24:43.666 --> 24:46.583
I'm not abandoning my home
based on a rumor.

24:47.251 --> 24:50.501
- Not even for Dorsa?
- Dorsa is better off in her own home.

24:52.416 --> 24:55.291
I have to go.
Think about what I said.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.876
I miss you.

24:59.584 --> 25:01.334
- Bye.
- I miss you too...

25:04.334 --> 25:06.167
400 miles from the battlefield...

25:06.209 --> 25:10.334
Tehran will become the new front line
for the ongoing Iran-Iraq war.

25:10.376 --> 25:11.876
Iraq has started launching missiles,
reaching out...

25:11.916 --> 25:15.876
- Where did you go, ma'am?
Your tea is getting cold. - Hold on.

25:15.916 --> 25:17.833
- Many Iranians have already left the
capital... - What about our tea party?

25:17.876 --> 25:22.959
- Playtime is over
- It's not. It's not. It's not.

25:23.001 --> 25:27.791
Enough! When I say playtime's over,
I mean it!

25:27.834 --> 25:29.417
If you don't listen to me

25:29.459 --> 25:32.459
next time I'll take Kimia away
so you can't play with her.

25:32.501 --> 25:35.834
- Understand?
- Did it hurt?

25:35.876 --> 25:40.251
It's okay. I'm here.
I'll look after you.

25:48.626 --> 25:50.084
Dorsa!

25:50.126 --> 25:51.791
Come here please.

25:58.584 --> 26:00.376
Are you still mad at me?

26:20.166 --> 26:22.126
We need to go downstairs right now!

26:39.916 --> 26:41.626
Dorsa!

26:41.666 --> 26:43.541
Dorsa!

26:45.459 --> 26:47.709
Somebody...

26:47.751 --> 26:48.959
Help me!

26:49.001 --> 26:51.751
Please!

26:53.376 --> 26:56.751
Dorsa?
Sweetheart?

26:56.791 --> 26:58.041
Dorsa?

26:58.084 --> 26:59.792
Dorsa?
Sweetheart?

26:59.834 --> 27:03.209
Please answer me...

27:04.376 --> 27:08.251
Oh, my sweetheart...

27:09.251 --> 27:14.291
- I saw them. They're real.
They were scary. - Saw who?

27:14.334 --> 27:18.209
- I saw them...
- What are you talking about? Shideh.

27:18.251 --> 27:21.084
Please... My dad...
My dad is dying.

27:21.126 --> 27:24.291
- Please help.
- Mum! Don't leave me!

27:24.334 --> 27:29.251
Please! Help my father! Save my dad.
You're a doctor. You can.

27:29.291 --> 27:33.751
- But I'm not a doctor...
- Mum! Don't go!

27:33.791 --> 27:40.458
- I'll look after Dorsa. Go.
- No, Mum! No!

27:53.959 --> 27:55.584
Come here.
He's here. Hurry!

27:55.626 --> 27:59.416
- Mr. Bijari?
- Father!

28:01.291 --> 28:03.958
Let's take him out of here.

28:04.001 --> 28:06.876
We can't be here.
This missile might still explode!

28:06.916 --> 28:10.626
Go and call an ambulance!
If I don't do CPR now, he'll die.

28:10.666 --> 28:14.251
Dad... My poor dad...
Come on.

28:15.251 --> 28:17.334
Come on.

28:17.376 --> 28:19.626
Come.

29:37.001 --> 29:40.334
Paramedics.
It's safe, you can come up.

29:48.584 --> 29:52.959
If I was a real doctor,
he might still be alive.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.166
Why do you say this?

29:55.209 --> 29:57.626
You did everything you could.

30:00.334 --> 30:04.876
- What's going on?
- Nothing, darling. Go back to sleep.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.334
She's not here!

30:39.501 --> 30:41.916
Kimia...
Kimia is not here.

30:41.959 --> 30:44.667
- Where was it before?
- On the bed...

30:51.001 --> 30:53.876
- They took her.
- Nobody took it.

30:53.916 --> 30:55.626
It's probably around
here somewhere...

30:56.709 --> 30:58.459
Are you okay?

30:59.666 --> 31:02.583
You're so hot!

31:02.626 --> 31:06.834
Oh, my baby...
My sweet, baby girl...

31:06.876 --> 31:10.126
They came and saw
she was alone and took her.

31:10.166 --> 31:14.251
Don't worry.
You should rest for now.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.958
Take your shoes off.

31:17.791 --> 31:22.251
Keep warm and rest
until your fever breaks.

31:23.541 --> 31:28.666
I promise to find her.
Okay?

33:26.876 --> 33:29.626
Mum, I had a bad dream.

33:37.666 --> 33:41.166
Don't be afraid.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.876
Don't be afraid.

34:07.041 --> 34:08.373
Dorsa?

34:08.417 --> 34:10.167
What are you doing?

34:10.208 --> 34:12.542
Going to get Kimia!

34:15.583 --> 34:20.083
I think she's upstairs... They've taken
her upstairs... I want to go, find her...

34:20.123 --> 34:23.416
Let's go back to bed.

34:50.458 --> 34:53.833
- You need to eat something.
- I can't.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.583
You have to eat
if you want to get better.

34:59.376 --> 35:02.334
Do you know what I'm going
to do after breakfast?

35:02.376 --> 35:04.167
I'll put a video on for you.

35:05.042 --> 35:09.542
You can lie in front of the TV all
day and watch whatever you want.

35:10.334 --> 35:13.917
But only if you eat breakfast.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.959
- Dorsa?
- Yes?

35:33.001 --> 35:36.209
- Have you seen my workout tape?
- No.

35:36.251 --> 35:38.376
It was here but I can't find it now.

35:38.417 --> 35:42.959
- I never touch the tapes.
- I didn't say you did.

35:51.167 --> 35:52.626
Who is it?

35:52.667 --> 35:53.584
Glazier.

36:00.709 --> 36:02.501
Just a second...

36:09.667 --> 36:12.459
- Hello.
- Hello.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.709
Business must be good at the moment
with all the attacks.

36:20.751 --> 36:26.001
Problem is, the missus insists
that it's too dangerous to stay.

36:26.042 --> 36:28.709
- Wants us to move out of town...
- Mum.

36:28.751 --> 36:32.751
I had my breakfast.
So, put the video on for me please.

36:32.792 --> 36:38.251
- You said you would.
- Let's go outside and let the man work.

36:39.376 --> 36:43.126
How many times have I told you not to
say we have a VCR, in front of a stranger?

36:43.167 --> 36:45.084
Do you want the authorities
to find out and take it away?

36:45.126 --> 36:49.126
But I'm bored...
I want Kimia.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.376
I told you I'll find Kimia.

36:58.501 --> 37:00.626
- Hello, Shideh...
- Hello...

37:00.667 --> 37:02.126
This is for you.

37:02.167 --> 37:03.292
For what?

37:03.334 --> 37:05.084
For your help yesterday.

37:05.126 --> 37:07.167
I'm also here to say goodbye.

37:07.209 --> 37:08.751
Goodbye?

37:08.792 --> 37:12.584
- I'm going back to Kurdistan for a while.
- But it's so dangerous over there.

37:12.626 --> 37:16.834
My father always wanted
to be buried in his hometown.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.584
Dorsa, my dear.

37:20.626 --> 37:27.001
Remember, yesterday after the missile hit,
you said you saw something or someone?

37:27.042 --> 37:28.417
Pargol?

37:28.459 --> 37:31.959
- You said they were scary.
You were crying. - Pargol? Go inside.

37:32.834 --> 37:37.626
Dorsa is a child. She imagines
things when she's scared...

37:37.667 --> 37:40.167
You probably think I'm going crazy...

37:40.209 --> 37:43.792
But my father was fine yesterday
after the missile hit.

37:43.834 --> 37:46.626
He was talking to me. I swear.

37:46.667 --> 37:51.084
I left the room to get him a glass
of water and then I heard him scream.

37:51.126 --> 37:53.167
I ran back and saw...

37:53.209 --> 37:55.459
He looked so terrified.

37:55.501 --> 38:01.084
His eyes were fixed on something
behind me I couldn't see.

38:01.126 --> 38:03.167
Something terrifying...

38:03.209 --> 38:04.584
Like...

38:08.167 --> 38:11.959
I understand how hard it is to deal
with the death of someone so close.

38:12.001 --> 38:15.834
You know I lost my
mother six months ago.

38:16.459 --> 38:21.917
But it was the shock of the missile
that gave your father a heart attack.

38:41.709 --> 38:48.126
- Is she still the same?
- Yeah.

38:48.167 --> 38:50.959
The fever still won't break.

38:51.001 --> 38:54.292
Maybe you should
take her to a doctor...

38:54.334 --> 38:57.542
I mean, like a pediatrician.

39:01.626 --> 39:03.167
I can't stand any more of this,
Ebrahimi.

39:03.209 --> 39:05.917
You have to close up shop
and take us out of town.

39:05.959 --> 39:09.667
If our tenants would
only pay what they owe

39:09.709 --> 39:15.084
then I could close up shop.
Mrs. Ebrahimi is right.

39:15.126 --> 39:20.709
I've told Fakur that we have to leave
everything and go to our son's in Paris.

39:20.751 --> 39:26.501
We just renewed our visas, so I see
no reason to sit through this.

39:42.876 --> 39:45.292
I missed you.

39:46.292 --> 39:49.084
I'm here for Dorsa.

39:50.167 --> 39:53.126
I always knew you were useless.

39:56.042 --> 40:00.751
- This can't be real.
- Why not?

40:16.751 --> 40:19.417
Where did you go, ma'am?

40:19.459 --> 40:23.126
Your tea is getting cold...
No, playtime is not over!

40:29.334 --> 40:30.792
It was on the bed.

40:35.126 --> 40:36.334
Nothing.

40:43.167 --> 40:44.876
Nothing here either.

40:45.834 --> 40:50.709
- Shideh, could you have dreamt it?
- It was too real.

41:28.626 --> 41:31.751
What's my workout video
doing in the bin?

41:34.251 --> 41:36.167
I'm talking to you.

41:45.792 --> 41:46.709
Dorsa?

41:47.584 --> 41:49.376
Dorsa...
What are you doing?

41:49.417 --> 41:50.959
Where is she?

41:51.001 --> 41:55.501
I want her back! Give her back!

42:06.167 --> 42:09.584
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for Kimia.

42:47.834 --> 42:52.251
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

42:56.751 --> 43:01.376
Finally some peace.

43:01.417 --> 43:06.751
Ebrahimi went out
and took the children with him.

43:10.626 --> 43:12.667
So, how is little Dorsa?

43:14.709 --> 43:18.209
- She's a little under the weather.
- Oh, God.

43:18.251 --> 43:21.792
Nothing serious, I hope?
No, just a cold I think.

43:21.834 --> 43:26.126
Have you heard any strange noises
around the building recently?

43:26.167 --> 43:29.542
If this is about Dorsa's screams
earlier in the stairway

43:29.584 --> 43:32.334
I apologize. She has been a bit
restless because of her fever.

43:32.376 --> 43:35.834
Mehdi has been very restless too
but he doesn't seem to be ill.

43:35.876 --> 43:38.626
I knew he'd bring trouble with him.

43:38.667 --> 43:41.209
Please don't say such things,
Mrs. Ebrahimi.

43:41.251 --> 43:43.167
I don't think you get it.

43:43.209 --> 43:45.959
That thing didn't crash
here by accident.

43:46.001 --> 43:49.126
I think it brought
something with it...

43:49.167 --> 43:51.001
Like what?

43:51.042 --> 43:53.459
Djinn.

43:53.501 --> 43:57.334
Djinn belong to fairy tales.

43:57.376 --> 43:59.709
This is not
A Thousand and One Nights.

43:59.751 --> 44:00.834
You're wrong.

44:00.876 --> 44:06.001
They travel on the wind from place to
place until they find someone to possess.

44:06.042 --> 44:08.001
Why are you telling me this?

44:08.042 --> 44:11.876
Why was Dorsa outside Bijari's
apartment, banging on the door?

44:11.917 --> 44:15.542
I told you she's delirious
because of her high fever.

44:15.584 --> 44:17.792
She was looking for someone.

44:17.834 --> 44:22.084
Her favorite doll is missing. She thinks
it has somehow gone to the fourth floor.

44:25.917 --> 44:27.626
I think I should go now...

44:27.667 --> 44:30.376
You know, if they take a personal
belonging...

44:30.417 --> 44:33.459
Something that you treasure...

44:33.501 --> 44:36.001
Then there's no escape from them.

44:36.042 --> 44:39.834
You'll be marked and they'll
always know how to find you.

44:41.959 --> 44:44.959
Sorry, I'm late.
Mrs. Ebrahimi accosted me.

44:52.792 --> 44:56.126
- What time is your flight?
- Early morning.

44:57.209 --> 45:00.667
You must be excited to see your son.

45:00.709 --> 45:03.834
The missile attacks have
actually been a good excuse.

45:03.876 --> 45:09.292
He has missed us lots too.
Even wanted to come back.

45:09.334 --> 45:12.876
I had to remind him that they'd
have him conscripted and sent

45:12.917 --> 45:19.834
conscripted the front line
as soon as he landed!

45:22.334 --> 45:23.917
What are you looking for?

45:23.959 --> 45:28.126
I remember you had this book,
The People of the Air, by Saedi.

45:28.167 --> 45:32.792
Yes, we have. Second shelf.
The contemporaries.

45:37.626 --> 45:39.751
Do you know what it's about?

45:39.792 --> 45:40.876
Djinn.

45:40.917 --> 45:44.709
It's about superstitious
belief in Djinn, down South...

45:45.917 --> 45:48.209
And how they travel on the wind.

45:48.251 --> 45:55.626
It's an anthropological book,
not a book to find answers in.

45:56.334 --> 45:58.417
What answers?

45:59.251 --> 46:01.209
I'm just saying

46:01.917 --> 46:07.501
people can convince themselves
anything's real if they want to.

46:10.167 --> 46:15.751
The winds refer to mysterious,
ethereal and magical forces

46:15.792 --> 46:19.334
which can be anywhere...

46:25.251 --> 46:33.209
Where there is fear and anxiety,
the winds blow.

49:31.084 --> 49:32.584
I'm glad I got hold of you.

49:32.626 --> 49:35.042
I thought you'd have left the city
like everyone else.

49:35.084 --> 49:38.084
I sent the family away.

49:38.751 --> 49:41.167
I'll join them during the weekend.

49:46.126 --> 49:49.501
- Have you heard from anyone recently?
- Not really.

49:49.542 --> 49:54.084
I've been to the university a few
times and seen a few old faces.

49:54.126 --> 49:56.751
Can you believe there are still people
from our time who haven't finished?

49:56.792 --> 49:58.626
They're obviously
not doctor material...

49:58.667 --> 50:01.792
- Did your own problem get sorted?
- No.

50:06.834 --> 50:09.542
Take a deep breath, sweetheart.

50:10.459 --> 50:12.542
I give her paracetamol
three times a day.

50:12.584 --> 50:15.459
Also started with antibiotics when
I saw the fever wasn't breaking.

50:15.501 --> 50:17.751
There's no sign of
internal infection.

50:17.792 --> 50:19.542
So, why isn't her fever breaking?

50:21.501 --> 50:24.501
Shideh, can I borrow
you for a second?

50:25.959 --> 50:27.876
Sit down, sweetheart.

50:34.251 --> 50:36.292
Is everything okay at home?

50:37.292 --> 50:38.667
Yes, why?

50:39.917 --> 50:42.376
Everyone's under a lot of strain
right now.

50:42.417 --> 50:47.376
Dorsa is no exception.
It could be stress related.

50:47.417 --> 50:49.001
Everything's fine.

50:50.667 --> 50:53.084
How about you?
Are you okay?

50:54.001 --> 50:56.542
Yes.

50:57.376 --> 50:58.667
I'm fine.

51:18.334 --> 51:20.417
What are you doing here on your own?

51:24.834 --> 51:26.542
Do you need a lift?

51:27.792 --> 51:29.084
Get in.

51:56.959 --> 51:59.001
Where is her doll?

52:18.167 --> 52:21.751
Where have you been, you little sod?

52:23.042 --> 52:25.667
Hi, thanks for dropping him off.

52:25.709 --> 52:29.417
- I saw him down the road...
- Do you want us to leave you behind?

52:29.459 --> 52:33.834
- Is that what you want?
- Leave him alone. It's okay...

52:33.876 --> 52:36.042
How's little Dorsa?

52:36.084 --> 52:38.751
The same.
Are you leaving too?

52:38.792 --> 52:43.167
What else can we do?
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

52:44.042 --> 52:45.626
Sorry...

52:48.584 --> 52:50.417
Have a safe trip.

52:52.542 --> 52:56.417
Please make sure you close the door
properly now that we are away.

53:17.459 --> 53:20.542
- What are you doing?
- We are leaving too.

53:20.584 --> 53:23.626
We can't.
What about Kimia?

53:23.667 --> 53:26.376
Okay. Try to remember
the last time you saw it.

53:27.209 --> 53:29.626
It's not there now.
So, where else could it be?

53:29.667 --> 53:33.001
- I don't know
- It didn't walk off on its own.

53:33.042 --> 53:35.792
- Someone took her.
- Who? Who took it?

53:35.834 --> 53:39.917
There's nobody here except for us.
Do you understand?

53:39.959 --> 53:43.501
- Why are you shouting at me?
- Because I'm tired of this silly game.

53:43.542 --> 53:46.001
If nobody took her,
where is she?

53:46.042 --> 53:47.834
I didn't move her.

53:48.584 --> 53:50.917
Just like you didn't
move my workout video, I suppose?

53:50.959 --> 53:54.251
I said I didn't touch
your workout video!

53:54.292 --> 53:56.167
How did it end up in the bin then?

53:57.292 --> 54:00.084
The doll is around here somewhere.

54:00.792 --> 54:03.417
It hasn't left the house
and nobody has taken it.

54:03.459 --> 54:06.626
If I didn't move her and nobody
took her, then where is she?

54:06.667 --> 54:10.626
I suppose I took her then,
right?

54:32.751 --> 54:36.167
Please...
We can't leave Kimia behind...

54:36.209 --> 54:38.709
I'll be scared without her.

54:38.751 --> 54:41.459
And I'll stay sick forever.

54:41.501 --> 54:44.001
Don't you want me to get better?

54:46.542 --> 54:50.667
If you love me,
please help me find her...

55:01.834 --> 55:05.834
Okay... But we'll leave
as soon as we find it.

56:32.834 --> 56:36.334
You can sleep next to me
tonight, if you want.

56:41.501 --> 56:43.292
Maybe it's over.

56:46.792 --> 56:49.251
Let's just stay a bit longer.

57:53.501 --> 57:55.667
What's wrong?

58:02.709 --> 58:05.209
Hi... Do you know where she is?

58:05.251 --> 58:09.459
On top of where? The bookcase?

58:09.501 --> 58:12.584
Who are you talking to?

58:12.585 --> 58:15.585
That lady.
She was standing right there.

58:39.626 --> 58:42.917
What's this look?
Are we in Swiss now?

59:00.042 --> 59:02.417
Here, cover yourself with this.
I'll go and speak to the Haji.

59:02.459 --> 59:05.292
What were you thinking? You know
your crime is punishable with lashes.

59:06.626 --> 59:09.417
So, pray that he shows mercy.

59:29.501 --> 59:30.417
Stand up.

59:33.792 --> 59:36.792
Look, I'm letting you off
this time with a warning

59:36.834 --> 59:39.751
only because Mrs. Hashemi
has vouched for you.

59:39.792 --> 59:41.334
Go and thank God that she did.

59:41.376 --> 59:44.001
Because this behavior
is absolutely intolerable.

59:44.042 --> 59:47.542
A woman should be scared of exposing
herself more than anything else.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.209
So, be ashamed.

59:49.251 --> 59:53.167
These are not the old times.
We have values now.

59:53.209 --> 59:59.459
Our men are becoming martyrs
to protect these values...

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:21.292
What are you doing?

01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:22.876
Nothing...

01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:29.334
- Looking for Kimia...
- Up there?

01:02:29.376 --> 01:02:31.709
I thought maybe she was up there.

01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:34.251
I told you I'd find it.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.792
You really need to rest,
especially with your fever.

01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:38.751
You hardly had any sleep last night.

01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:53.209
Promise me that you'll find her.

01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:54.626
I promise.

01:02:57.209 --> 01:02:59.209
My dear...

01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.542
Hello?

01:03:10.584 --> 01:03:13.751
- Hello? Shideh?
- Hello? Hello?

01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:16.459
- Why are you still there?
- Hi.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.376
Please. Can you not be stubborn
about this under the circumstances?

01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:21.376
I'm not being stubborn.

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:24.376
- Everyone's fleeing Tehran.
- But...

01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:28.542
- But what? - Something has gone
missing. I have to find it first.

01:03:28.584 --> 01:03:31.709
- What? - You wouldn't understand,
you haven't been here.

01:03:31.751 --> 01:03:34.959
I'm just hearing excuses. I think its
best I get my parents to contact you...

01:03:35.001 --> 01:03:36.251
No...

01:03:36.292 --> 01:03:38.792
...and officially invite you.

01:03:38.834 --> 01:03:42.792
- Listen to me...
- I know you well enough. You're just a...

01:03:42.834 --> 01:03:46.459
Hello?
You're cutting out... Hello?

01:03:49.001 --> 01:03:50.709
Who is it?

01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:22.751
Dorsa!
Dorsa, open the door!

01:04:31.417 --> 01:04:33.334
Where were you?

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:39.667
Did you see anyone?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.751
Who?

01:04:41.459 --> 01:04:42.917
I don't know... Like a lady?

01:04:45.084 --> 01:04:46.876
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.251
She comes when you're not around.

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:52.792
What does she do?

01:04:52.834 --> 01:04:56.542
She plays with me. She's nice.

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:58.417
What does she want?

01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:00.876
She says...

01:05:01.584 --> 01:05:04.834
You can't look after me but she can.

01:05:05.917 --> 01:05:07.876
That's nonsense.

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:11.876
She says she knows where Kimia is.
She can help me find her...

01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:18.251
This is all in your head.
She's not real.

01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:23.542
But you said you saw her too.

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:35.542
To the last person, to the last home

01:05:36.376 --> 01:05:39.001
and to the last drop of blood

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:44.626
we are standing
in exaltation at the word, God.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:20.542
- Mum, can I go back to bed?
- No.

01:06:20.584 --> 01:06:22.126
You've to stay where I can see you.

01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:24.209
On the sofa?

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:29.209
Didn't we agree not to come in here
anymore? The room is off limits.

01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:36.542
- If I can't be there, then why are you?
- Because I'm looking for your doll.

01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:41.001
The lady was right.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:45.501
What did you say?
I'm sick of this nonsense!

01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:49.834
I don't want to hear about this lady
anymore, whether she's real or not!

01:06:49.876 --> 01:06:51.542
Understand?

01:06:51.584 --> 01:06:53.501
I'll run off with her then!

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:08.376
Stop it!

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:11.501
Stop!

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:27.209
Please... Have me instead...

01:08:27.249 --> 01:08:30.542
Please...

01:08:58.292 --> 01:09:00.084
Dorsa?

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:02.167
Dorsa?

01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:09.874
I woke up and you weren't here.

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.999
- I heard noises.
- What noises?

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.166
Hello?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:01.542
Shideh, have you found what
you were looking for yet?

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.458
Hello, Iraj.

01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:05.626
You might find this hard to believe,
but...

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.667
But I really think there
is something haunting us.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:16.458
They've taken Dorsa's doll and...
I have to find it...

01:10:16.501 --> 01:10:20.001
If I don't, they'll never leave Dorsa
alone...

01:10:21.001 --> 01:10:23.458
But you can't protect Dorsa.

01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:30.709
You're useless!
You're nothing but a disappointment!

01:10:30.751 --> 01:10:33.042
Even your daughter hates you!

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:36.166
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up, whore!

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:38.666
You brought this on yourself!

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.291
Go away!

01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:51.001
What is that?

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.916
Your loving mother...

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:42.876
Why did you do that?

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:47.126
You killed her!
You killed her!

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:52.041
- I didn't do it.
- Liar!

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:54.458
They did it.
The ones you talk about.

01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:57.208
That's your drawer!
You hide your things in it!

01:11:57.251 --> 01:12:01.417
That's why they put it in here.
They want you to think that I did it.

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:07.001
But you said they're not real.

01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:13.042
Okay. The important
thing is we found her.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.041
But she's dead!

01:12:15.917 --> 01:12:18.751
- I'll fix her.
- How?

01:12:22.542 --> 01:12:25.417
Lie on the bed and close your eyes.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:28.166
It'll be fixed when you open them.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:31.501
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

01:13:03.376 --> 01:13:04.667
Dorsa.

01:13:05.626 --> 01:13:07.042
Dorsa.

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.542
Dorsa.

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:24.708
Look!

01:13:27.417 --> 01:13:29.084
Your fever has gone.

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:34.458
You know I love you, right?

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.458
Right?

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:52.876
We'll be downstairs
until the danger is over

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:54.709
and then we'll leave
and go to granny's.

01:13:54.751 --> 01:13:56.792
I don't want to stay here anymore.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:58.958
Wear your coat.

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:02.333
It's not here.
Maybe it's in your room.

01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:04.417
Let's go. I'm right behind you.

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:13.667
I'm right here!

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.501
I'm right here!

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:20.376
Wait for me.

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:37.166
Why aren't you coming?

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.416
Did you hear something?

01:14:46.751 --> 01:14:53.917
Mum! Mum! Mum!

01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:57.041
Please, Mum...

01:14:57.083 --> 01:14:59.876
Help me, Mum!

01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:02.917
Please!

01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.251
It sounds like you.

01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:12.417
- Dorsa!
- Don't go!

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:14.666
Dorsa!

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:16.626
Dorsa, I'm coming!

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:18.167
Dorsa!

01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:20.876
Dorsa!

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:23.292
Dorsa!
Mummy's coming!

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:27.501
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

01:15:28.126 --> 01:15:32.251
- Mummy!
- Leave her alone!

01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:34.708
Dorsa!

01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:40.833
Mummy!

01:15:40.876 --> 01:15:42.583
Mummy!

01:15:42.626 --> 01:15:44.417
- Mummy!
- Dorsa?

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.791
- Dorsa?
- Mummy!

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:50.376
- I'm here, sweetheart.
- Mummy!

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:57.834
- Mummy... It has got me!
- I've got you!

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:30.167
- Dorsa?
- Don't come close.

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:32.291
Why did you leave me again?

01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:35.376
I made a mistake.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:39.542
- What?
- Whom are you talking to?

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:42.626
The lady...
She says you took Kimia!

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:44.876
- Me?
- She says you were hiding it!

01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:48.876
- No. She's lying.
- You're lying. You took it.

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:53.209
- Don't lie.
- Yes. Maybe.

01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:56.001
I'm not sure.
I really don't know...

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:59.376
But I know I love you very much.
I'm telling you the truth.

01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:04.292
If I've upset you in any way,
I'm sorry.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.626
I didn't mean to.
Please forgive me.

01:17:06.667 --> 01:17:10.542
I know you're scared.
I am too. Come over here.

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:14.001
Let's leave, then we won't be
afraid... Come here, sweetheart.

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:16.583
Mum!

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:18.501
Mum, please help me!

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:19.917
Mum!

01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:23.208
Mum, please help me!

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:38.041
Mum!

01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:43.167
Dorsa!

01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:45.751
- Mum!
- Dorsa!

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:49.584
Mum, please help me...

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.333
Don't leave me...

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:01.708
Don't leave me!

01:18:03.542 --> 01:18:05.042
Oh, my God!

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:07.542
Are you okay, my dear?

01:18:12.001 --> 01:18:15.583
Go! I'll come too. Hurry up.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:27.417
No. Don't come to me.
Don't step on the ground.

01:18:27.458 --> 01:18:29.001
Go up.

01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:56.583
Run...

01:18:56.626 --> 01:18:57.876
Run!

01:19:02.126 --> 01:19:03.708
Kimia!

01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:11.376
Hurry up...

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:15.126
Get in.

01:19:30.167 --> 01:19:32.251
Shit!

01:19:41.792 --> 01:19:45.042
Mum...
What is wrong?

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.458
Mum...

01:19:47.167 --> 01:19:49.876
- Mum?
- Come to the front.
