[Jefferson]<i> Previously</i>
<i> on</i> Black Lightning...

00:02.303 --> 00:06.005
You are the storm,
so you can control the storm!

00:06.007 --> 00:07.740
Don't fear it. Own it.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.043
Need a ride?

00:11.045 --> 00:13.045
I do need you
to contact your son.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.980
Boy knows a lot
about my business.

00:14.982 --> 00:18.484
-He's not gonna stop
until he kills me.
-I got you.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.321
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna need
money on the run.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.823
-What up, Painkiller?
-Here to collect.

00:27.895 --> 00:28.961
[Jennifer grunts]

00:30.698 --> 00:32.564
Go, go, go.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.333
[Jennifer]
<i> What we need is a plan.</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:36.368
My aunt,
let's go to her house.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.604
Need to ask you
a few questions
about your nephew.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.140
You know damn well
you ain't no detective.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.207
Why pretend?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.475
[screams]

00:46.347 --> 00:48.280
[both grunting]

00:54.622 --> 00:55.721
Come on. Come on.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.989
[panting]

00:59.493 --> 01:01.660
-Where'd they go?
-Tell me you have him.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.963
Not yet. He's got a cut.
They won't get far.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.365
[both panting]

01:25.052 --> 01:27.386
[Jennifer]
That's it. Okay.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.954
Come on, come on.
Khalil, come on.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.992
[Khalil] One sec. Here.
Right there. Come on.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.327
Okay.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.397
Okay, sit, sit, sit.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.299
[Khalil groans]

01:41.135 --> 01:42.401
God.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.870
[panting]

01:47.007 --> 01:49.274
You're burning up.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.276
I thought the toxins
they pumped you full of

01:51.278 --> 01:53.445
were supposed to heal
from stuff like this.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.514
Yeah, J...

01:56.250 --> 01:57.883
Yeah.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.818
Look, we just need to...

01:59.820 --> 02:00.686
[groans]

02:00.688 --> 02:02.754
You about to fall
on your ass.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.726
Too weak to travel.
You're clammy.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.729
I'm not a doctor,

02:10.731 --> 02:13.699
but if that cut
gave you a fever,
it might be infected, Khalil.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.100
Look, we don't have
any other choice.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.302
I'm gonna try and find you
some antibiotics or something.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.171
Hey. Hey, no.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.739
Yo, yo, it's way too risky.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.307
We got people out there
searching for us.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.444
Well, what do you want
me to do? Sit here
and watch you get worse?

02:25.446 --> 02:29.414
If it was me laying there,
you'd do the exact
same thing, wouldn't you?

02:30.217 --> 02:31.617
Huh?

02:33.053 --> 02:34.453
I'll be right back.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.732
[sighs]

02:50.204 --> 02:51.803
[line ringing]

02:53.474 --> 02:56.108
Jeff, did you find her?

02:56.110 --> 02:59.578
<i> Do you have her?</i>
<i> Jeff, please just tell me</i>
<i> she's safe.</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:00.779
Babe, I wish
I could tell you that.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.214
But the truth is,
I don't know.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.515
<i> Why? What happened?</i>

03:03.517 --> 03:05.751
When we got
to Khalil's aunt's house,

03:05.753 --> 03:08.387
there was this woman,
highly skilled with knives,

03:08.389 --> 03:09.922
probably sent by Tobias.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.490
<i> She was here before us.</i>

03:11.492 --> 03:13.992
Is... is Jennifer okay?
She wasn't hurt, was she?

03:13.994 --> 03:15.427
No, not that I could see.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.896
She and Khalil disappeared
during the chaos.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.033
And then they somehow
managed to take out
one of Gambi's drones.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.468
So you don't even know
which direction she went in?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.470
No, Lynn.
We will find her.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.738
[sighs in frustration]

03:29.243 --> 03:30.509
Lynn?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.712
[Thunder] So what happened?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.181
Bitch came to my house,
looked like she was
trick-or-treating.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.816
She must have
hit me or something,

03:37.818 --> 03:41.386
because the next thing I knew,
you all were standing over me.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.188
Looks like Khalil darted her.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.691
Gambi just gave her
the antivenom to help
speed up recovery.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.926
-How you feeling now?
-How does it look
like I'm feeling?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.529
I knew I shouldn't have
let his ass stay here.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.564
Yeah, well, he probably
just saved your life.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.234
Look, any idea
where they're headed?

03:55.236 --> 04:00.138
They didn't tell me.
And I don't think
they wanted me to ask.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.907
[Gambi]
I might have an idea.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.577
[glass crunching]

04:08.082 --> 04:11.250
This blood splatter
is consistent with
castoff from a knife,

04:11.252 --> 04:14.219
our mystery woman's
weapon of choice.
And since none of us are cut--

04:14.221 --> 04:17.522
It was definitely Khalil's.
She was on top of him
when we came in.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.091
Jen could be hurt, too.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.326
Either way, they might seek
medical attention.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.061
They'd never
expose themselves.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.296
Yeah, probably not.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.931
But right now,
it's the only lead we got.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.200
I'll tap into the local
database, check out
the doctors in the area.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.535
All right. And we'll check out
the hospitals and the clinics.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.570
How do you wanna split 'em up?

04:31.572 --> 04:33.005
There's probably
only a handful,

04:33.007 --> 04:36.108
so we should stick together
in case there's trouble.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.645
Is this because
you're worried, or you're
trying to keep an eye on me?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.247
Both.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.848
Well, believe me,
if anything happens
to Jennifer,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.816
I'll be the one
bringing the trouble to them.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.386
<i> ¶ Last night</i>
<i> I saw a superhero</i>
<i> He was black ¶</i>

04:47.388 --> 04:50.689
<i> ¶ He said</i>
<i> "This is for the street</i>
<i> Black Lightning's back" ¶</i>

04:58.098 --> 04:59.331
What happened?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.999
Nothing.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.703
I just... I don't know.
I couldn't sit around
doing nothing anymore.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.372
Come on in.

05:07.374 --> 05:10.242
At least we can
be miserable together.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.576
Thank you.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.881
[Lynn]
Can I see Khalil's room?

05:18.218 --> 05:20.952
It's pretty much
how he left it.

05:20.954 --> 05:25.190
I'm not sure you'll find
anything that'll do you
any good, but...

05:27.127 --> 05:31.563
-You don't mind
if I snoop around a bit?
-Nope, have at it.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.669
Just being in here
breaks my heart.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.808
I knew I had done
everything right
this time around.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.044
But when that bullet hit,

05:46.046 --> 05:49.614
I knew he was no better off
than my other son.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.651
Khalil had a brother?

05:52.653 --> 05:56.555
Yeah. He was hardly 15
when he died.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.790
Running with that
One Hundred gang.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.394
Got killed slinging mud
on them corners.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.695
I'm so sorry.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.699
One son dead,
one son on the run.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.635
Seems that motherhood
was never meant
to be my calling.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.071
No, don't say that.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.540
You still have a son,
and he still needs you.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.075
Now more than ever.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.378
Is this Khalil's father?

06:21.014 --> 06:23.181
Seems pretty recent.
Are they close?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.217
Do you think he knows
how to contact him?

06:25.219 --> 06:26.284
I couldn't say.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.787
Here's what I know.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.391
That man ain't nothing
and never will be.

06:32.393 --> 06:36.128
Far as I'm concerned,
he can go to hell.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.907
[camera clicks]

06:52.746 --> 06:55.147
Despite your many successes
this past year,

06:55.149 --> 06:58.617
Todd, we've decided
that the grant
for advanced encryption

06:58.619 --> 07:00.385
is going to another candidate.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.124
Let me guess,
Garett Tortolani?

07:06.693 --> 07:09.027
Actually, yes.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.763
The same Garett Tortolani
whose rich white dad

07:11.765 --> 07:14.132
just donated a new wing
to the research center?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.735
Quite frankly, I resent
the implication, Mr. Green.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.003
Well, you can resent it
all you want.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.471
That doesn't make it
any less true.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.039
Good day, Mr. Green.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.774
The panel's decision
has been made,
and that decision is final.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.042
-Some straight bull!
-Security!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.677
You can take that
grant to hell,

07:25.679 --> 07:28.713
'cause that's where
all of you corrupt,
racist bastards are going!

07:28.715 --> 07:30.015
-Security.
-Thank you, brother.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.317
Don't touch me.
Don't... Look, don't touch me.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.355
Don't touch me.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.562
[woman on PA]
<i> Surgery, pick up line 24.</i>

08:17.564 --> 08:19.731
<i> Surgery, pick up line 24.</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:37.449
[indistinct announcement]

08:42.389 --> 08:44.055
[current buzzing]

08:49.196 --> 08:50.929
[buzzing increases]

08:54.768 --> 08:57.202
[high-pitched tone]

09:05.913 --> 09:06.978
Okay.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.168
...shoulder-length cut.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.871
Maybe a little bit longer
than the shoulders,
about till here.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.806
No?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.875
Another dead end.

09:53.876 --> 09:56.560
I mean, by now,
who knows how far
they could have gotten.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.867
Mom still not answering?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.038
Your mother's
been through a lot.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.175
She probably
just needs a minute.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.145
[man] Mary, we got
a major power outage in here.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.849
Copy that. I'm on it.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.219
-[Jefferson] What?
-Did you hear that?

10:21.221 --> 10:25.390
So this guy thinks
some kind of power surge
shorted out the machine.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.791
But what if...

10:26.793 --> 10:28.927
Wait, Dad. Come here.
Look up top.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.763
That... There's a scorch mark.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.934
Yeah, it has to be her.
But if she's willing
to take this risk...

10:35.936 --> 10:38.503
Khalil must be
in pretty bad shape.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.605
Gambi, I think
we got something.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.620
Hey. Hey.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.989
You okay?

10:58.759 --> 11:00.392
Never better.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.926
Hopefully this will help.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.995
Let's see.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.464
[sighs]

11:06.466 --> 11:10.068
You wouldn't happen to have
a secret heroin addiction?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.203
Or use some
performance-enhancing drugs?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.438
[chuckles]

11:13.440 --> 11:14.873
[coughs]

11:16.076 --> 11:20.278
No. No, but...
But I wish I did.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.214
You imagine how fast
I would have been?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.116
Yeah, and I still would have
smoked your ass.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.486
Only because I would have
liked the view after you did.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.488
Oh, it's like that?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.557
You better be nice,
'cause I'm about
to stick you with this.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.594
If I can figure out
how to do it.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.598
When I hacked into
the hospital's CCTV,
I found this.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.841
Okay.
Can you delete this footage?
At least keep her out of jail.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.243
Well, the good news is,
Jennifer isn't hurt.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.413
Yeah, the bad news is,
now both of my daughters
are thieves.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.383
Sometimes you've gotta
do the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.552
Okay. You see this?

12:00.554 --> 12:03.288
That means that she was here
the same time you were.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.157
All right. Well,
they couldn't have
gone too far, then.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.527
With Khalil injured,
they're probably holed up
somewhere nearby.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.329
Can you tell which direction
she was headed in?

12:11.331 --> 12:14.165
Well, when she
pulled out of here,
she was traveling east.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.368
Whoa. Wait.
Freeze that, right there.
In the mirror.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.939
Damn, who is this bitch?

12:23.710 --> 12:26.311
Now that we have a face,
I can do some serious digging,

12:26.313 --> 12:27.812
find out exactly
who we're dealing with.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.380
I'm going east.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.182
[Gambi]
What are you talking about?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.418
Jeff!

12:36.957 --> 12:38.423
What the hell are you doing?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.492
You're not going anywhere
without your suit
to protect you.

12:40.494 --> 12:41.793
We don't have time for that.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.428
I lost her twice,
I'm not losing her again.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.030
Not without your suit, Jeff.
You know how risky that is.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.099
Dad, come on. That's crazy.
Are you insane?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.834
There is a killer
on my daughter's tail,

12:49.836 --> 12:51.970
hired by Tobias,
which means that she's--

12:51.972 --> 12:53.304
She's after Khalil.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.206
No, she will kill
whoever's in her way.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.875
Look, finding Jennifer
is our priority,

12:56.877 --> 13:00.211
but you flying around
without your suit
is just plain reckless, Jeff.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.614
You risk exposing yourself
and your entire family.

13:02.616 --> 13:06.851
The only thing I care
about in this moment
is finding Jennifer.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.220
-Jeff, you're not listening.
-Get off of me.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.890
Have you lost your damn mind?
I raised you!

13:11.892 --> 13:13.858
Get off!

13:13.860 --> 13:16.728
Dad! This has
gone too far, guys!

13:16.730 --> 13:20.398
Now, we all wanna
find Jennifer, but it's not
gonna happen like this.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.738
Jeff, I'm sorry.

13:26.740 --> 13:30.775
You've lost perspective.
Please, don't lose your life.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.519
[Jennifer sighs]

13:42.856 --> 13:45.390
[Jennifer]
The antibiotics should have
kicked in by now.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.793
[Khalil]
Unless it's too late.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.062
Hey, don't even say that.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.498
Don't say stuff like that.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.534
[Khalil] J...

13:57.003 --> 13:58.303
[shivering]

13:58.305 --> 14:01.806
Whatever this is,
it's getting worse.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.143
I'm on fire.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.011
I'm not hearing
that right now.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.280
Stop it. Not after
everything we've been through.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.421
I remember
when I first saw you.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.793
Are you seriously getting
all corny on me right now?

14:21.795 --> 14:25.463
[coughs]
No. No. No, this...

14:27.567 --> 14:31.469
This is a memory
I'll keep for myself.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.606
But...

14:34.608 --> 14:36.274
[breathing unsteadily]

14:36.276 --> 14:41.079
I knew then
that you were special.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.486
Well...

14:50.423 --> 14:53.458
I remember all the girls
at Garfield going on and on

14:53.460 --> 14:55.493
about Khalil this
and Khalil that.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.662
And I'm like, "What the hell
is the big deal?

14:57.664 --> 14:58.863
Who is Khalil?"

15:00.400 --> 15:02.000
And, um,

15:02.002 --> 15:04.235
then I saw you standing
at your locker.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.105
And I can't lie.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.374
First thing that popped
into my head was...

15:10.677 --> 15:12.110
"Well, damn!"

15:12.112 --> 15:13.645
[both chuckle]

15:18.551 --> 15:19.717
You hear me?

15:36.803 --> 15:37.902
[rap song playing]

16:07.634 --> 16:11.336
Hold up.
He invited me.
He invited me.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.271
Let the man in.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.641
Don't you know
this is our guest of honor?

16:20.013 --> 16:23.314
Todd Green.
Born in Fort Valley.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.816
Graduated college at 17.

16:24.818 --> 16:29.053
Earned both
your Masters and PhD
by the time you were 21.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.222
It's kind of weird
that you know all that.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.159
I've been monitoring you
for a while now.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.694
When I heard you weren't
gonna get that grant,

16:36.696 --> 16:38.963
well, I figured it was
a good time to reach out,

16:40.767 --> 16:43.134
introduce myself.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.604
I mean, how did you know
what they would decide
before I even knew?

16:53.747 --> 16:55.580
This is really good.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.416
At $500 a bottle,
it better be.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.886
Must be tough,

17:01.888 --> 17:07.725
smart kid like you,
good family,
good private schools,

17:07.727 --> 17:11.596
always getting passed over
despite his superior talents.

17:11.598 --> 17:16.000
Why do you think that is,
Todd, that you keep
getting passed over?

17:19.406 --> 17:23.775
It's because it's the black
man's burden to carry
the weight of white privilege.

17:23.777 --> 17:28.046
Without the benefits
of being rich or white,

17:28.048 --> 17:30.548
you'll never be better
than second best.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.751
Well, unless of course
you change the game.

17:33.753 --> 17:37.555
Here, I saved you
the best seat in the house.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.735
Oh! Oh...

17:50.737 --> 17:53.905
Now, if these women
aren't to your liking,
I can get you others.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.641
Or if you'd prefer men--

17:56.642 --> 17:59.376
No. No, but... But thank you.
I actually prefer
to not be touched.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.846
That... That would be
my preference.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.682
Ladies, you heard the man. Go.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.324
This is what they call
the good life, Todd.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.625
And you'd better
get used to it,

18:14.627 --> 18:17.295
because that old life
just doesn't exist anymore.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.063
I don't even know
why I'm here.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.233
I did some reading today.

18:22.235 --> 18:26.804
In fact, I probably read
everything that's ever
been written about you.

18:26.806 --> 18:30.241
Press doesn't really paint you
in the most flattering light.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.276
I'd like to think
that we're both worth

18:32.278 --> 18:35.246
more than the labels
society put upon us.

18:35.248 --> 18:39.050
Just know this,
I come to you as a friend,

18:39.052 --> 18:41.052
a friend with
enormous resources

18:41.054 --> 18:43.321
who can pull you up out
of that second-class status

18:43.323 --> 18:45.289
you've been branded with.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.425
All you have to do is say yes.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.926
[cell phone vibrating]

18:56.336 --> 18:58.035
Excuse me for a moment.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.209
Yes.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.578
Our friend's gonna be dead
within the hour.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.981
<i> -Thought you should know.</i>
-I had one request,

19:09.983 --> 19:12.450
and that was for him
to be brought in alive.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.585
Which was clearly my intent.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.522
But when those
metas showed up,
I went with the poison blades.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.223
If it wasn't for his
enhanced immune system,

19:19.225 --> 19:20.358
he would've been
dead hours ago.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.093
Are you a...

19:22.095 --> 19:25.730
My terms were very clear.
If you want your money,
abide by them.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.065
Tobias, come on,
dead is dead.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.568
Let's not make
things difficult.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.871
Death at someone else's hands
is too easy an outcome.

19:33.873 --> 19:38.109
I want him alive.
No exceptions. No excuses.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.924
Giselle Cutter.
Assassin, tracker,

19:52.926 --> 19:55.326
world-class martial artist,
mercenary for hire.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.628
-Is she a meta?
-There are rumors.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.897
People have had her
lined up point-blank,
and they've missed.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.200
-She's bulletproof?
-Bullets never hit her.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.636
It's also been said that
she can literally throw
knives around corners.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.605
That says to me,
low-level telekinetic.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.407
-Any connection to Tobias?
-Nothing solid.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.409
And she's been tracking Jen
since the hospital.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.044
She's several hours
ahead of us.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.113
These markers signify
all of the zoned locations
within the county.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.582
A total of 41.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.318
I've searched every structure
30 miles east of the hospital.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.153
There's nothing but mountains
to the north.

20:22.155 --> 20:25.756
Now, if Khalil was hurt
bad enough that Jen
would steal medicine,

20:25.758 --> 20:26.958
there's no way
he's hiking that terrain.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.927
That leaves us
with 15 possible locations,

20:29.929 --> 20:33.631
including some farms,
silos and an old power plant.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.600
Keep monitoring the sheriff
and police scanners.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.636
-We still doing this together?
-No, there's no time.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.408
[sighs]

20:44.410 --> 20:46.711
I figured I'd see you.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.013
<i> Hard for anyone</i>
<i> to get into the sanctum</i>
<i> without me knowing.</i>

20:49.015 --> 20:50.648
<i> What are you trying to find?</i>

20:50.650 --> 20:53.751
I got the name
of Khalil's father, Kito.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.554
I'm hoping he might be
able to help us find them.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.322
<i> Is a name all that you have?</i>

20:58.324 --> 21:00.291
That, and he just
got out of jail.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.726
<i> Try the FBI database.</i>

21:01.728 --> 21:04.829
<i> Once he's been fingerprinted,</i>
<i> he's in the system.</i>

21:08.901 --> 21:10.601
<i> "Possession with</i>
<i> intent to sell.</i>

21:10.603 --> 21:12.103
<i> Assault and battery.</i>

21:12.905 --> 21:14.472
<i> Resisting arrest.</i>

21:14.474 --> 21:16.340
<i> Carrying a concealed weapon</i>
<i> without a permit."</i>

21:16.342 --> 21:17.975
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i> this is a good idea?</i>

21:17.977 --> 21:19.977
No, but I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.379
<i> Well, if I thought</i>
<i> it'd do any good,</i>

21:21.381 --> 21:22.446
<i> I'd try to talk you</i>
<i> out of it--</i>

21:22.448 --> 21:23.481
I know. I'm as stubborn

21:23.483 --> 21:24.682
as the rest of my family.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.618
I'll be careful. I just...
I need an address.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.186
<i> All right,</i>
<i> we're chasing the clock here.</i>

21:29.188 --> 21:30.388
<i> I've gotta get back.</i>

21:30.390 --> 21:32.723
Right. If I find anything,
I'll let you know.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.897
[door beeps]

22:04.991 --> 22:06.590
[Khalil shivering]

22:06.592 --> 22:08.025
Please don't die.

22:15.735 --> 22:16.901
God...

22:17.537 --> 22:19.203
God, please don't
let him die.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.806
Please.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.909
Did you say something, J?

22:25.478 --> 22:26.744
What?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.114
No.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.684
[whispers] No.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.789
Khalil,
I'll be right back, okay?

22:38.791 --> 22:40.658
I'm just gonna
go step outside.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.926
I'll be right back.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.627
Right back.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.642
[sobbing]

23:15.695 --> 23:17.695
[current buzzing]

23:33.079 --> 23:34.745
What... What happened?

23:34.747 --> 23:38.249
You tell me.
This is a place
of your own making.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.851
Wait.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.754
So this is
different than before?
You're not actually here?

23:43.756 --> 23:47.458
Everything you need to know
is already inside of you.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.093
What does that even mean?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.728
I think she means me.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.265
But I'm just as scared
as you are.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.935
Let your fear be your guide.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.838
Two parts of your brain
working in harmony.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.108
So if she's
a part of my brain,
then so are you?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.276
Indeed.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.714
There's something humming
out there in the dark.

24:10.716 --> 24:11.782
Like that machine
at the hospital?

24:11.784 --> 24:14.785
Yeah, exactly.
Just not as strong.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.855
But there's nowhere
to plug something in.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.357
-Batteries.
-Batteries.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.026
[buzzing continues]

24:31.337 --> 24:34.405
If there are binoculars,
then someone's
out there watching us.

24:34.407 --> 24:38.309
If you know where to look,
electricity can be
found anywhere.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.178
Including the human body.

24:41.180 --> 24:45.783
Okay.
Mrs. Glew's chemistry class,
fourth period.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.419
We had a whole
section on this.
Think, think, think.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.087
Okay, let me see. Um...

24:50.089 --> 24:52.056
We learned about
charged elements,

24:52.058 --> 24:54.525
human voltage,
electrical currents, ions--

24:54.527 --> 24:56.894
If there's all this
electricity in the body,

24:56.896 --> 24:58.929
and we can see the binoculars,

24:59.799 --> 25:02.199
then we should
also be able to see...

25:02.201 --> 25:03.801
[high-pitched tone]

25:10.309 --> 25:12.743
[gasps] Run!

25:53.953 --> 25:55.286
You good?

25:56.455 --> 25:58.088
I thought you left.

25:58.691 --> 25:59.957
Never.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.026
Never.

26:21.514 --> 26:23.447
-Anything?
-No.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.853
Look, I just wanted to...
I wanna...

26:29.855 --> 26:33.223
-I just wanna say--
-Jeff. Jeff, we're good.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.200
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing.

26:43.202 --> 26:46.103
There must be some buildings
that haven't been registered
with the county,

26:46.105 --> 26:48.005
or that are just obscured
from satellite imagery.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.773
-What about Cutter?
-Nothing.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.141
From everything I've gathered,

26:51.143 --> 26:54.244
if she doesn't wanna be found,
we're not gonna find her.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.746
But she's probably
found Jennifer.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.448
No, Dad.
Dad, we don't know that.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.016
But at this point,
we have to assume the worst.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.051
[Gambi] There's gotta be
something we're missing.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.220
[screams]

27:04.590 --> 27:06.757
My daughter's
a damn generator.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.926
I'm Black Lightning,
and I can't find her.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.494
Dad, come on.
Take a deep breath.

27:10.496 --> 27:13.998
It is because
you're Black Lightning
we're gonna find her.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.033
You gotta believe that.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.570
I don't believe
anything right now.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.482
[current surging]

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
What did you do to him?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.321
You can tase me all you want,
I'm not telling you nothing.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.960
Tell me what you did.
He's gonna die.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.528
Bitch, we all gonna die.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.963
[Khalil coughs]

27:52.805 --> 27:56.073
What did you do? Tell me!

27:56.075 --> 27:57.141
[grunts]

27:57.743 --> 27:59.610
[breathing heavily]

28:01.714 --> 28:03.313
[laughing]

28:04.583 --> 28:07.251
You are gonna die tonight.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.356
Why the hell
didn't the medicine work?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.508
What does the red tape mean?

28:34.647 --> 28:36.313
Well, I'd like to find out.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.752
How about I use
one of your own
poison knives on you,

28:41.754 --> 28:43.454
make you suffer like he has?

28:46.826 --> 28:50.961
As smart as you are,
you probably have an
antidote on you somewhere...

28:52.364 --> 28:53.664
Just in case?

28:55.034 --> 28:56.767
Let's find out where it is.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.035
[grunts]

29:12.818 --> 29:14.585
It's in my necklace.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.326
Booyah.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.462
Oh...

29:26.565 --> 29:27.631
And this one's for Khalil.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.272
Hey, hey. I got something.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.141
I got something.
Hang in there.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.525
Hey.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.528
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to scare you. I'm...

30:31.530 --> 30:33.997
I'm Lynn Stewart,
Jennifer Pierce's mother.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.900
Our kids are in danger.
I was hoping you might
be able to help.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.069
-He's running from Tobias.
-We assume so.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.774
I warned him to stay
away from that dude,
but he wouldn't listen.

30:43.776 --> 30:45.509
Felt like he owed him
for his legs.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.611
Do you have any way
to get in contact with him?

30:47.613 --> 30:48.912
Just his cell phone.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.415
He pretty much keeps me
at arm's length.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.818
And if you talked to Nichelle,
you know she hates me
something fierce.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.287
I was already doing time

30:57.288 --> 30:59.021
when our other boy, Keenan,
started running wild,

30:59.024 --> 31:01.258
hanging on the corner,
same way that I had.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.860
Is there anybody
you can think of?

31:02.862 --> 31:06.663
A friend, a cousin, a pastor,
a couch he might
have crashed on?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.065
No, nothing.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.634
He got this new place,

31:10.636 --> 31:12.502
but I never heard him
talk about neighbors
or roommates.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.439
I don't know why,
I just assumed he was
staying with Tobias.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.841
Do you know where
this new place is?
Do you have an address?

31:17.843 --> 31:19.543
I'm sorry, I don't.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.412
He definitely wasn't staying
with Tobias, though.
That I know for sure.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.183
-Kito, thank you.
-Yeah.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.194
Let's just run
through them again.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.695
But we've searched
all of these.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.031
[Black Lightning] Yes, Gambi,
the clock is ticking.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.432
I feel like
I'm wasting my time.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.434
Now, why do you think
we're gonna find
something new?

31:44.436 --> 31:46.970
Look, like I said,
we must be missing something.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.639
Jennifer is
out there somewhere.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.275
This is like finding
a needle in a haystack.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.411
Wait a minute.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.713
Maybe the haystack's
the problem.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.783
Gambi, can you increase
the voltage threshold
in these goggles?

31:59.785 --> 32:01.385
Yes. Why?

32:01.387 --> 32:04.588
Most generators
and large appliances
operate at about 240 volts.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.524
And since Jen runs
much hotter than that,
by increasing the threshold--

32:07.526 --> 32:09.693
We'll be able
to narrow down the search.

32:12.798 --> 32:13.931
[Black Lightning] Okay.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.732
All right, let's go. Come on.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.402
I need you to isolate
each location so I can
lock in the coordinates

32:18.404 --> 32:19.703
and see if
anything new pops up.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.376
All right.
Here's the laundromat
Anissa went to.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.884
Here's the pumping station
you saw.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.152
Here's the power plant.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.857
What about this last one?

32:41.727 --> 32:42.826
It's not on the list.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.829
That's gotta be her.
Let's go.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.475
Hey.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.280
-[sobbing]
-Hey.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.248
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.616
Thank you, God.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.420
-Don't cry.
-I thought you were dead.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.322
Come on, J.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.226
You know you can't
get rid of me that easily.

33:18.630 --> 33:19.763
[kissing]

33:21.900 --> 33:22.966
I love you.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.471
I love you, too.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.875
Don't scare me
like that, please.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.643
Don't leave me out here, okay?

33:33.645 --> 33:36.480
I got you. It's okay.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.789
What, uh...

33:45.790 --> 33:47.690
-What exactly happened here?
-She pissed me off.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.393
She's lucky
after everything she did,

33:49.395 --> 33:51.695
I still decided
to give her the antidote.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.697
The antidote?

33:53.699 --> 33:55.866
I'll tell you later.
Are you good to go?

33:56.668 --> 33:58.201
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

33:58.203 --> 33:59.636
-I'm fine.
-Come on.

34:21.860 --> 34:25.395
There's quite a bit
of blood over here.
I assume it's Khalil's.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.634
It looks like someone
was held captive here.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.636
There's drag marks
on the ground.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.505
Could be sign of a struggle.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.973
You think it was Jennifer?

34:36.975 --> 34:38.775
With Cutter on their tail,

34:40.312 --> 34:42.546
it's hard to think otherwise.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.881
We saw a series
of electrical pulses.

34:44.883 --> 34:47.684
Maybe try the goggles.
See if there's
any residual traces.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.765
[Black Lightning] Yeah,
they were definitely here.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.534
This whole area is lit up
like a Christmas tree.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.070
Let's walk the perimeter.

35:12.111 --> 35:15.479
<i> We tracked 'em to a barn</i>
<i> where it looks like</i>
<i> they were hiding.</i>

35:15.481 --> 35:17.280
And?

35:17.282 --> 35:19.683
They were already gone
by the time we got here.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.585
Jeff, there's something
you're not telling me,

35:21.587 --> 35:22.819
I can hear it in your voice.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.756
-Lynn--
-No, please don't lie to me.
Not now.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.992
Just tell me the truth.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.395
Did they kill her?

35:33.932 --> 35:35.799
Is that what you're saying?

35:36.568 --> 35:39.336
[tearfully]
<i> Is Jennifer dead?</i>

35:39.905 --> 35:41.004
I don't know.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.557
[rap music playing]

36:12.938 --> 36:14.004
T...

36:15.974 --> 36:17.841
The nerd wants to see you.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.144
I believe you owe
Todd an apology.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.115
I said apologize.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.785
I'm sorry, man.
No disrespect.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.724
I trust you're having
a good time?

36:36.395 --> 36:39.196
Yeah. A little too good,

36:39.198 --> 36:42.632
which is why the question
keeps rattling
around in my mind.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.669
Why me?
Why are you doing this?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.071
Let's just say I'm a big fan.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.706
Well, I'm flattered, but...

36:49.708 --> 36:52.943
I'm afraid I'mma have to
decline whatever it is
that you're offering.

36:52.945 --> 36:56.580
But thank you, you know,
for your generosity.

36:58.383 --> 37:02.219
Though I respect it, Todd,
I think you're bluffing.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.054
Now, we could blame it
on the alcohol

37:04.056 --> 37:07.057
or that surge of excitement
at being wanted,

37:07.059 --> 37:10.660
but if I had my guess,
I'd say this is about power.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.996
Now, how's that?

37:12.998 --> 37:15.365
By rebuffing my offer.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.168
Even if for a moment,
it made you feel strong.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.236
[chuckles]

37:19.238 --> 37:21.071
Like you're in control.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.873
Funny thing is,
there's very few people
in this world

37:23.875 --> 37:26.042
that can do what
I'll be asking you to do.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.945
And that is why you're here.

37:28.947 --> 37:33.817
If you come work for me,
not only would I make you
incredibly rich,

37:33.819 --> 37:37.454
but you'd have more
control and more power
than you've ever dreamed of.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.422
[cell phone vibrating]

37:39.424 --> 37:41.825
Go ahead, look at it.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.965
Did you really just deposit
100 grand into my account?

37:48.967 --> 37:51.868
If it's a problem,
I can take it back.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.937
I wanted you to know
I put a value on your time.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.607
No. [stammers]
Whatever it is, I'm in.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.851
You know Tobias
is never gonna stop, right?

38:08.620 --> 38:09.986
My family, either.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.024
I know.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.596
J, we're never gonna be able
to run fast enough.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.897
You know that, right?

38:20.899 --> 38:23.600
Then we'll find a place
to hide, you know?

38:23.602 --> 38:25.702
Get 'em off our scent
for a while.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.742
[Jennifer clears throat]

38:33.345 --> 38:35.145
I think you should go home.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.014
[scoffs]

38:38.016 --> 38:39.716
I'm not going anywhere.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.086
J, come on. Look,

38:43.088 --> 38:45.155
you deserve better than this.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.924
Look, just because
my life is jacked,

38:47.926 --> 38:49.492
doesn't mean that
yours has to be.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.194
[Jennifer] I'm not
hearing you right now.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.263
I'm the ride or die type,
you already know that.

38:53.265 --> 38:55.932
Yeah, and it's the dying part
that I'm afraid of.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.033
Well, I'm not.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.938
We're in this together, okay?

39:04.476 --> 39:08.311
And after everything
we've been through,

39:08.313 --> 39:10.680
what should we
even be afraid of?

39:45.951 --> 39:48.818
-[blow landing]
-[man yells]

39:56.161 --> 39:57.227
[grunts]

40:06.271 --> 40:07.837
[man groaning]

40:23.388 --> 40:24.721
There you are.

41:03.528 --> 41:05.295
[cell phone vibrating]

41:10.235 --> 41:13.036
It's done. What's next?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.041
Well, how much we talking?

41:21.279 --> 41:22.912
Freeland, huh?

41:51.910 --> 41:54.043
[closing theme music playing]
