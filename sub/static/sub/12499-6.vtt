00:28.677 --> 00:31.257
Right on time.

00:33.966 --> 00:36.966
Mmm... feel the burn.

00:40.568 --> 00:42.471
Aah!

00:42.472 --> 00:44.932
<i>Brickleberry...</i>

00:49.552 --> 00:53.333
Hey, Malloy, nice jersey.
Looks like you're wearing a purple dress.

00:53.334 --> 00:56.373
Yeah, I'm gonna take fashion critiques
from a guy in a clip-on and mom jeans.

00:56.374 --> 00:59.637
These aren't my mom's jeans, she couldn't
fit into them anymore, they're mine.

00:59.638 --> 01:03.041
Hey, Malloy's just showing his
spirit for the big game today.

01:03.042 --> 01:05.477
I can't wait to watch it
with you, little buddy.

01:05.479 --> 01:07.749
Aw, damn it! My cookie.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.549
- Five second rule!
- Five...

01:09.550 --> 01:10.801
- I can't get it!
- Four...

01:10.802 --> 01:13.262
Connie, help!

01:14.955 --> 01:16.884
Oh, my God. That was a close one.

01:16.885 --> 01:17.968
[Crunching]

01:17.969 --> 01:19.692
Thank you, Connie.

01:19.693 --> 01:22.326
- No problem.
- Oh, come on, Connie.

01:22.327 --> 01:24.857
Don't be so modest.
You're like a freak of nature.

01:24.858 --> 01:26.322
- Mm.
- Steve!

01:26.323 --> 01:27.979
We all know Connie's a lumbering, hulk-like

01:27.980 --> 01:30.309
affront to humanity, but
it's not nice to say it.

01:30.310 --> 01:33.345
That's why I learned sign language.

01:33.346 --> 01:35.733
I was giving Connie a compliment, Ethel.

01:35.734 --> 01:38.491
God blessed her with
unnatural lesbian strength.

01:38.492 --> 01:40.739
Lesbian? Watch your mouth, Steve.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.321
That's a hate word.

01:42.322 --> 01:45.279
I think it's high time I speak
to you all about tolerance.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.623
We should be tolerant of everyone,
be they straight, be they gay,

01:49.624 --> 01:52.811
or the Jesus hates homos church who
are having a rally at the Park today.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.771
Jesus hates homos?
They're an ignorant cult.

01:55.772 --> 01:57.670
Well, that's intolerant.

01:57.671 --> 02:00.318
How would you feel if they
said bad things about you?

02:00.319 --> 02:03.495
That's all they do! I know because...

02:03.496 --> 02:05.627
I used to be a member.

02:05.628 --> 02:07.562
It was 15 years ago.

02:07.563 --> 02:10.660
I was your average, everyday little girl.

02:10.661 --> 02:12.202
[Grunts]

02:12.203 --> 02:15.224
I wanted to please my mother so much.

02:15.225 --> 02:16.931
[Rip]

02:16.932 --> 02:19.108
[Girls giggling]

02:19.109 --> 02:23.262
She just ignored me and my hankering for
hoo haa untill she couldn't anymore.

02:23.263 --> 02:26.565
My father and the church members
made a "gay curing" machine.

02:26.566 --> 02:29.134
They called it "the homo eradicator."

02:29.135 --> 02:31.347
You like that, sinner? Do you?

02:31.348 --> 02:34.706
I'll bet Slater from Saved by the
Bell would make you Screech.

02:34.707 --> 02:35.907
Mmm...

02:35.908 --> 02:38.143
Doesn't Pat Sajak hold your gay back?

02:38.144 --> 02:39.115
Mmm...

02:39.116 --> 02:41.717
And try romancin' Ted Danson.

02:41.718 --> 02:42.621
Mmm.

02:42.622 --> 02:45.142

[Rapid beeping]

02:50.756 --> 02:52.433
[Electrical buzzing]

02:52.434 --> 02:53.958
- You had enough?
- No.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.909
I wanna see how it ends.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.665
When it didn't work, my
parents disowned me.

02:59.666 --> 03:02.601
They bought a St. Bernard, named it Connie,

03:02.602 --> 03:05.395
and photo shopped me out of
all the family pictures.

03:05.396 --> 03:07.663
I never spoke to them again.

03:07.664 --> 03:08.879
Man, that's messed up!

03:08.880 --> 03:11.674
If they wanted a dog named Connie,
they could've just kept you.

03:11.675 --> 03:12.821
Shut up, idiot.

03:12.822 --> 03:15.205
Connie, I never knew you'd
been through so much.

03:15.206 --> 03:17.316
Woody, you can't have that
hate-filled church here.

03:17.317 --> 03:21.052
Yeah, yeah. Maybe I should reconsider
having these hate-mongers at our Park.

03:21.053 --> 03:22.954
- They paid cash.
- Cha ching!

03:22.955 --> 03:24.897
Welcome, hate mongers!

03:24.898 --> 03:26.758
We need to make these
people feel comfortable.

03:26.759 --> 03:29.681
Time to de-gay the Park!
Connie, put on this dress.

03:29.682 --> 03:32.163
Yow. That's a tough sell. Here.

03:32.164 --> 03:34.533
For the next 24 hours, you're
gonna be a straight guy

03:34.534 --> 03:37.894
named Chester... Beefbottom.

03:38.447 --> 03:40.547
[Groans]

03:42.442 --> 03:45.000
You don't think I'm a freak, do you?

03:45.001 --> 03:48.238
Whatever you say.
Just don't stick me in your crotch again.

03:48.239 --> 03:50.477
Connie? Oh, Sweetie, take that off.

03:50.478 --> 03:52.875
I cannot believe how insensitive Woody is.

03:52.876 --> 03:54.072
Oh!

03:54.073 --> 03:56.005
I already took off the fake one!

03:56.006 --> 03:58.790
- Ooh! Sorry.
- Thanks for understanding, Ethel.

03:58.791 --> 04:01.586
- You know I didn't choose to be this way.
- Well, that's up for debate.

04:01.587 --> 04:03.604
But you are an incredible person.

04:03.605 --> 04:07.936
You're sweet, you're considerate,
you're beautiful, inside and...

04:07.937 --> 04:09.668
Well, inside.

04:09.669 --> 04:14.763
- Oh. I didn't know you felt this way.
- Of course I do. Come here.

04:14.764 --> 04:16.940
Go for it!

04:16.942 --> 04:19.108
Connie... no! Oh, God, gross!

04:19.110 --> 04:20.283
[Sobbing]

04:20.284 --> 04:22.914
Connie, wait! I didn't mean gross.
I just meant...

04:22.915 --> 04:26.480
Slightly nauseating.
I just feel a little sick.

04:26.481 --> 04:31.581
I probably won't vomit!
[Connie sobbing distantly]

04:32.659 --> 04:34.999
Welcome to Brickleberry.
Make yourselves at home.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.662
Who put that there?

04:36.663 --> 04:38.530
Woody, here's the remainder of the payment.

04:38.531 --> 04:40.673
- I hope cash is okay.
- Cash?

04:40.674 --> 04:42.217
I love cash!

04:42.218 --> 04:44.810
But not as much as I love vagina.

04:44.811 --> 04:47.456
Don't you think vagina's much
better than a dude's butthole?

04:47.457 --> 04:49.437
I do.

04:49.888 --> 04:51.655
Where are you taking us, Connie?

04:51.656 --> 04:53.178
Away from everyone.

04:53.179 --> 04:57.721
Woody's having that stupid church here,
and Ethel thinks I'm slightly nauseating.

04:57.722 --> 04:59.059
[Ahem] Slightly?

04:59.060 --> 05:01.252
Hey. No smoking in the Park, mister.

05:01.253 --> 05:03.293
Uh-oh!

05:06.070 --> 05:07.190
[Slam, clank, beep]

05:07.191 --> 05:09.628
How am I ever gonna get in here?

05:09.629 --> 05:11.429
Oh.

05:12.332 --> 05:13.177
[Triggers cock]

05:13.178 --> 05:15.218
Uh-oh.

05:15.925 --> 05:19.255
Ooh. They may be ignorant Morons,
but their cash is green.

05:19.256 --> 05:22.209
Think I'm gonna play golf this
weekend to celebrate the windfall.

05:22.210 --> 05:24.305
Denzel, do you wanna caddy again?

05:24.306 --> 05:28.279
He can't. Denzel and I have plans.
We're going to Pez Con!

05:28.280 --> 05:30.656
- Pez Con?
- Uh, yeah!

05:30.657 --> 05:32.455
For pez collectors. Like me.

05:32.456 --> 05:34.362
Will you say that again,
so I can record it?

05:34.363 --> 05:37.589
Then I'll have something to play
back when I forget why I hate you.

05:37.590 --> 05:41.586
Denzel, why the hell are you going?
You're not a dork like Steve.

05:41.587 --> 05:45.826
He's going with me because we're friends.
Something money can't buy.

05:45.827 --> 05:49.334
You must have forgotten, Steve,
that I always get what I want.

05:49.335 --> 05:52.447
- Denzel, I'll pay ya double.
- Double? Oh, hell, yeah.

05:52.448 --> 05:55.132
Come on, Denzel.
I can't go to Pez Con alone.

05:55.133 --> 05:57.293
The pez heads will think I'm a loser!

05:57.294 --> 05:59.277
The pez heads will think I'm a loser!

05:59.278 --> 06:00.278
Got it.

06:00.279 --> 06:02.914
Gays are witty. Gays are clean.

06:02.915 --> 06:05.726
They are polite, they are good dancers,

06:05.727 --> 06:09.190
snappy dressers, and raise property values.

06:09.191 --> 06:11.733
But you got to take my word for it...

06:11.734 --> 06:14.157
Homosexuals are evil!

06:14.158 --> 06:15.032
[Applause]

06:15.033 --> 06:18.646
Thank you. There is nothing that
Jesus hates more than a gay...

06:18.647 --> 06:22.730
Not a murderer, not a
rapist, not even a Jew.

06:22.731 --> 06:26.871
- But Jesus was a Jew.
- Stone him!

06:28.826 --> 06:31.537
At ease, soldiers. Just a Park Ranger.

06:31.538 --> 06:33.932
Sorry about that, Mr... Beefbottom.

06:33.933 --> 06:36.248
Wow. What is this place?

06:36.249 --> 06:39.841
You're inside of a top-secret
military research facility.

06:39.842 --> 06:41.687
- Top secret?
- Yes!

06:41.688 --> 06:44.022
So you must promise to
keep our secret a secret.

06:44.023 --> 06:45.880
Pinkie swear!

06:45.881 --> 06:47.212
Good enough for me.

06:47.213 --> 06:50.297
The government has been using
Brickleberry as a cover for decades.

06:50.298 --> 06:54.966
What we do here is develop highly
classified, specialized explosives.

06:54.967 --> 06:57.538
This bomb gives the enemy low blood sugar.

06:57.539 --> 06:59.858
Try fighting a war when you're all cranky.

06:59.859 --> 07:02.410
This one makes your face
look like Bruce Jenner's.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.476
Usually leads to mass suicide.

07:04.477 --> 07:07.000
This bomb turns people into dead people.

07:07.001 --> 07:09.080
Just a regular bomb, really.

07:09.081 --> 07:11.249
This one's a gay bomb. This one's a...

07:11.250 --> 07:14.414
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Gay bomb?
Tell me about this one.

07:14.415 --> 07:16.690
It's, uh... top secret.

07:16.691 --> 07:19.347
- Show the top secret film!
- Are you sure about that?

07:19.348 --> 07:21.242
Yeah. He did the pinkie swear.

07:21.243 --> 07:25.625
Top secret Movietone news, your
source for all things classified.

07:25.626 --> 07:28.321
The Jerries were on the march
to take over all of Europe.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.664
Uncle Sam's only hope was a secret weapon

07:30.665 --> 07:33.922
developed using state-of-the-art
homo-nuclear technology...

07:33.923 --> 07:36.020
The gay bomb.

07:36.021 --> 07:39.432
Ka-pow. And like that, those
krauts went from sour to sweet.

07:39.433 --> 07:43.599
The gay bomb...
pride of America, savior to the world!

07:43.600 --> 07:48.641
This baby turns every person in a 20-mile
radius into an instant homosexual.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.169
Wow. I never knew there was a gay bomb.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.111
Well, that's just the slang name.

07:53.112 --> 07:55.966
The eggheads back in Los Alamos
call it "the sissy missile."

07:55.967 --> 07:57.827
Hmm.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.453
[Growls]

08:05.454 --> 08:08.017
Screw it. Set this bitch off.

08:08.018 --> 08:10.408
What did that hand just say?

08:10.409 --> 08:13.349
No! Stop that hand!

08:21.030 --> 08:24.510
Oh, no, you didn't! [Snap]

08:25.572 --> 08:27.110
[Effeminately] What have you done?

08:27.111 --> 08:30.784
The shock wave is going to hit all
of those people any minute now!

08:30.785 --> 08:33.884
He's my friend, and he's
going to Pez Con with me!

08:33.885 --> 08:36.169
Bullshit! He is a grown man.

08:36.171 --> 08:39.621
He can make his own decisions.
He's caddying for me.

08:39.623 --> 08:41.591
[Rumbling]

08:41.592 --> 08:42.893
Denzel is my man!

08:42.894 --> 08:48.794
You can have him after I get through
with his brown chocolate ass and balls.

08:54.650 --> 08:58.374
Wow! This is the utopia I've dreamed of!

08:58.375 --> 09:00.478
Connie, is that you?

09:00.479 --> 09:02.103
Uh, Reverend Rusty?

09:02.104 --> 09:05.686
Oh, talk about an eye
opening moment, you know?

09:05.687 --> 09:08.922
I can't believe I was all
about hate for so many years.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.288
I just wanna apologize for
[Shrilly] being so rude to you.

09:12.289 --> 09:14.624
Uh... no problem.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.366
Would you two cut it out?

09:16.367 --> 09:18.929
We're late for the Kathy
Griffin show in Tucson.

09:18.930 --> 09:21.397
<i>All aboard the winky wagon!</i>

09:21.398 --> 09:23.798
[Bell dings]

09:27.479 --> 09:29.110
Hiya, Coco.

09:29.111 --> 09:32.326
Oh, my God, have you
seen my snuggly wuggly?

09:32.327 --> 09:33.944
- Who, Malloy?
- Mall... ha ha!

09:33.945 --> 09:37.566
No, miss thing. My boy toy, Denzel.

09:37.567 --> 09:40.387
Ooh! There he is.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.691
How do these pants make my ass look?

09:48.692 --> 09:51.272
- Big?
- Good!

09:51.285 --> 09:54.106
Conini Panini! There you are.

09:54.107 --> 09:56.690
Hey, Steve. I love your frosted tips.

09:56.691 --> 09:58.846
Thank you. What did Woody want?

09:58.847 --> 10:01.255
- He's looking for Denzel.
- That bitch!

10:01.256 --> 10:02.838
Ta ta!

10:02.839 --> 10:04.424
This is awesome!

10:04.425 --> 10:06.125
What the hell is going on, Connie?

10:06.126 --> 10:09.127
Woody's acting really weird.
Steve, pretty much the same.

10:09.128 --> 10:13.172
Well, I found this secret base, I
accidentally set off a gay bomb, and then...

10:13.173 --> 10:16.653
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I read about that
in highly unlikely bullshit magazine.

10:16.654 --> 10:18.968
Connie, sorry about earlier.

10:18.969 --> 10:23.099
I've always liked you a lot as a friend,
but something's different about you.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.461
Your thighs are so...
your breasts are completely...

10:27.462 --> 10:29.966
I just wanna bang your frigging brains in.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.411
Thank you, Jesus!

10:32.412 --> 10:34.538
Ethel, don't rush it.

10:34.539 --> 10:36.360
I've dreamed of this moment.

10:36.361 --> 10:39.781
I wanna do it just right.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.185
This is like a dream, Connie.

10:48.186 --> 10:49.730
I know.

10:49.731 --> 10:52.971
Don't ever wake me up.

10:53.090 --> 10:55.190
[Cooing]

11:01.023 --> 11:02.801
[Music stops] Oh, no!

11:02.802 --> 11:04.926
Oh, my God... no!

11:04.927 --> 11:08.767
- What's wrong?
- I'm straight!

11:09.291 --> 11:12.902
Ten seconds left in triple overtime!
One final play!

11:12.903 --> 11:15.215
Give me that!
It's The Cupcake Wars season finale.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.625
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- Ugh. I cannot get into sports.

11:18.626 --> 11:20.844
Change it back. [Click]

11:20.845 --> 11:24.381
And that's it!
The best play in the history of sports!

11:24.382 --> 11:26.973
What's that, Jim?
Our instant replay machine broke?

11:26.974 --> 11:30.338
Hmm. Well, it looks like if you missed
that play, you'll never get to see it.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.766
We now join The Bachelorette
already in progress.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.700
Yay! Ow!

11:34.701 --> 11:38.073
You know that's a hate crime.

11:38.074 --> 11:38.960
[Door opens]

11:38.961 --> 11:40.507
Hi, brown sugar.

11:40.508 --> 11:42.676
- You getting pretty for me?
- Maybe.

11:42.677 --> 11:44.178
These are for you.

11:44.179 --> 11:45.683
Oh... my...

11:45.684 --> 11:47.290
[Shrieks] God!

11:47.291 --> 11:49.311
Wow. You really like roses, huh?

11:49.312 --> 11:54.652
Oh, Woody, Woody, I love
it, I love it, I love it!

11:56.046 --> 11:58.192
I can't believe I'm not gay anymore.

11:58.193 --> 12:01.046
The blast from the bomb
must have done it somehow.

12:01.047 --> 12:02.995
I wonder if... mm...

12:02.996 --> 12:04.796
Uh!

12:05.637 --> 12:08.323
Oh, no. My lesbian strength.

12:08.324 --> 12:10.739
It's gone! Oh, my heavens.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.372
I broke a nail.

12:12.373 --> 12:15.059
Honk, honk. Why'd you run off, sexy?

12:15.060 --> 12:17.878
You left me high and not-so-dry back there.

12:17.879 --> 12:22.649
Uh, Ethel, look, I don't know
how to explain this, but...

12:22.650 --> 12:24.564
I'm just not into you anymore.

12:24.565 --> 12:26.718
What? You're kidding. You're rejecting me?

12:26.719 --> 12:29.180
Nobody rejects me. I am [Bleep] hot.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.816
I'm at least a nine.
You're, what, a four, a five?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.651
And that's on the goddamn Richter scale!

12:33.652 --> 12:36.269
Oh. Look, I'm sorry, Ethel.

12:36.270 --> 12:38.755
You don't understand.
I can be with whoever I want.

12:38.756 --> 12:41.114
- And I wanna be with you.
- No.

12:41.115 --> 12:43.342
Oh, your mouth says no,
but your body says...

12:43.343 --> 12:45.931
No! My body says no too.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.747
Hmm. Playing hard to get, huh?

12:47.748 --> 12:50.308
Well, that gets my lady parts
barking like a Jack Russell.

12:50.309 --> 12:52.469
[Barking]

12:54.842 --> 12:59.642
That big, pasty butt'll
be mine soon enough.

13:00.528 --> 13:03.007
Oh, I can't believe I'm straight.

13:03.008 --> 13:05.948
This is a disaster.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.627
Excuse me, Sir. We're late.

13:10.628 --> 13:13.289
Do you know where the Jesus
hates homos rally is?

13:13.290 --> 13:15.510
Mom? Dad?

13:15.767 --> 13:16.751
[Gasps]

13:16.752 --> 13:19.246
Both: Connie? [Woof woof]

13:19.247 --> 13:23.327
Oh, not you, Connie. The bull dyke.

13:25.150 --> 13:27.981
Your eyes glisten like a star.

13:27.982 --> 13:32.789
Your skin is brown and
tasty like a Kit Kat bar.

13:32.790 --> 13:35.250
[Horn blasts]

13:35.260 --> 13:37.461
Yoo-hoo! Denzel!

13:37.462 --> 13:41.482
Wanna take a ride on a real boat?

13:41.699 --> 13:43.101
You're not leaving me, are you?

13:43.102 --> 13:45.836
No, Steve, I'd rather stay
here and listen to your poem.

13:45.837 --> 13:47.504
- Really?
- Hell, no! [Snaps]

13:47.505 --> 13:50.325
[Bleep] Your poem.

13:50.541 --> 13:52.141
[Engine revving]

13:52.142 --> 13:53.090
[Ding ding]

13:53.091 --> 13:54.644
Aah!

13:54.645 --> 13:56.965
Dear, why haven't you
called in all these years?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.004
You moved and didn't give me the number.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.051
Right. Well, it's been fun.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.487
- Let's do it again in 15 years.
- Or 20.

14:03.488 --> 14:07.958
Wait. Mom, dad, I have
something to tell you.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.872
- I'm straight!
- Oh!

14:09.873 --> 14:12.238
Really? Oh, thank God!

14:12.239 --> 14:15.899
My little girl.
Oh, we've got our daughter back!

14:15.900 --> 14:19.274
Alan, it may be kind of awkward
having two Connie's around though.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.579
Way ahead of you.

14:20.580 --> 14:21.845
[Dog whimpering]

14:21.846 --> 14:23.340
Shh, shh...

14:23.341 --> 14:25.440
Go to sleep, Connie.

14:25.441 --> 14:27.901
Go to sleep.

14:30.315 --> 14:31.982
She called me her little girl.

14:31.983 --> 14:34.251
Mommy's little girl!

14:34.252 --> 14:35.585
Hello, lover.

14:35.586 --> 14:36.820
Aah!

14:36.821 --> 14:39.756
Ethel, stop trying to get
a peek at my baby maker.

14:39.757 --> 14:41.992
You're gonna ruin everything with my mom.

14:41.993 --> 14:44.713
Oh, screw that crotch blocker.
That woman had you tortured.

14:44.714 --> 14:46.438
Things are different now, Ethel.

14:46.439 --> 14:48.399
She even bought me this body wash.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.375
No! I like it when you smell
like the floor of a circus.

14:52.376 --> 14:56.106
- Alan, we have a problem.
- Yeah.

14:56.107 --> 14:58.355
I can't believe you ruined my game, Woody.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.371
[Whirring]

14:59.372 --> 15:00.787
What the hell are you doing?

15:00.788 --> 15:03.809
I have company coming over later, and
you're shedding all over the house.

15:03.810 --> 15:05.653
And you left toothpaste in the sink again.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.984
Toothpaste in the sink?
Last week you got drunk

15:07.985 --> 15:09.792
and shit down the garbage disposal.

15:09.793 --> 15:12.808
Well, that was the old me.
Meet the new me, honey.

15:12.809 --> 15:15.859
I'm here, [Smack] I'm queer,
get used to it! [Snaps]

15:15.860 --> 15:17.561
I'm fine if you turn into a gay guy.

15:17.562 --> 15:20.254
But only you would turn into the
most annoying gay guy on Earth.

15:20.255 --> 15:23.323
That was uncalled for,
you heartless bastard!

15:23.324 --> 15:24.868
[Sobbing]

15:24.869 --> 15:25.960
[Door slams]

15:25.961 --> 15:29.706
And now I suddenly have
sympathy for Katie Holmes.

15:29.707 --> 15:31.141
My little girl is straight.

15:31.142 --> 15:33.444
Oh, we're gonna spend
the whole day together.

15:33.445 --> 15:34.945
I'm so excited, mom.

15:34.946 --> 15:39.806
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh,
boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

15:40.436 --> 15:42.328
Hope I'm not interrupting anything!

15:42.329 --> 15:44.388
Can't you see we're busy getting busy?

15:44.389 --> 15:46.173
I'm not speaking to you.

15:46.174 --> 15:48.157
Denzel, I just wanted to give you this.

15:48.158 --> 15:51.223
Ooh, arts and crafts!
Oh, turn down the flame a little bit.

15:51.224 --> 15:53.283
Oh, Steve, I love it.

15:53.284 --> 15:54.971
Huh?

15:54.972 --> 15:56.766
Oh, no, you don't! He's mine!

15:56.767 --> 15:58.602
- Says who?
- Says me!

15:58.603 --> 16:01.161
Will you two stop it? I like both of you.

16:01.162 --> 16:04.694
- But he likes me more.
- You shut your big mouth!

16:04.695 --> 16:06.087
[Shrilly] Aah!

16:06.088 --> 16:08.441
[Grunting, muttering]

16:08.442 --> 16:10.449
I'll claw your eyes out.

16:10.450 --> 16:13.570
That's it. I'm done.

16:15.259 --> 16:19.519
Hey, anybody else got a little stiffy?

16:19.716 --> 16:22.400
Ethel, I've come to my senses.

16:22.401 --> 16:26.421
I need your evil lesbian body now.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.376
Connie?

16:29.377 --> 16:31.255
That was a weird note, but I...

16:31.256 --> 16:35.336
No! Hey! What are you doing to me?

16:35.400 --> 16:38.465
Meet the homo eradicator.

16:38.466 --> 16:41.051
You know, I never really
liked that name that much.

16:41.052 --> 16:44.314
I always thought we should call
it "the queer-o-disappear-o."

16:44.315 --> 16:46.517
- [Gasping] Alan, stop!
- Shh, shh.

16:46.518 --> 16:48.128
- I was just kidding.
- Go to sleep, Chuck.

16:48.129 --> 16:51.213
- I like the name, Alan.
- Go to sleep.

16:51.214 --> 16:53.736
Connie, you look great in your outfit.

16:53.737 --> 16:56.096
I don't know. It's kinda itchy, mom.

16:56.097 --> 16:59.488
Well, sometimes having
class is itchy, dear.

16:59.489 --> 17:01.794
What's the matter?
You haven't touched your crumpets.

17:01.795 --> 17:04.246
Oh, I was just thinking
about my friend Ethel.

17:04.247 --> 17:07.275
Oh, that evil lez ho? About her...

17:07.276 --> 17:09.037
It was supposed to be a surprise,

17:09.038 --> 17:12.520
but your father is
reprogramming her as we speak!

17:12.521 --> 17:13.540
No!

17:13.540 --> 17:17.575
What? You should be happy for that skank.
Look how well this worked on you.

17:17.576 --> 17:20.866
It doesn't work, mother.
That machine is torture.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.066
It does work. Look at you now.
You used to be a freak.

17:24.067 --> 17:28.050
I liked being a freak.
All my life, I just wanted your acceptance.

17:28.050 --> 17:31.221
But it's not worth it. I gotta be me!

17:31.222 --> 17:35.542
Now, excuse me while I save my friend.

17:36.392 --> 17:39.212
I'm taking these.

17:39.918 --> 17:42.198
And these.

17:42.804 --> 17:45.725
You gonna eat that pink one?

17:45.726 --> 17:47.122
Ethel!

17:47.123 --> 17:50.065
I can't get past those guards
without my lesbian strength.

17:50.066 --> 17:53.261
Come on, Connie. You must have a
little lesbian left in there.

17:53.262 --> 17:54.686
Just dig deep.

17:54.687 --> 17:57.627
Yeah. You're right.

18:03.587 --> 18:05.421
You bastard! Let her go.

18:05.422 --> 18:06.618
Let her go!

18:06.619 --> 18:09.473
That's it, sinner. Let it all out.

18:09.474 --> 18:12.654
Get your hands off me.

18:13.956 --> 18:18.326
Those maniacs are gonna torture Ethel to
death, and I'm powerless to stop them.

18:18.327 --> 18:19.425
That's it!

18:19.426 --> 18:21.611
I need to reverse the
effects of the gay bomb.

18:21.612 --> 18:23.841
- Yes, we do.
- Malloy?

18:23.842 --> 18:25.844
Yes. This is my problem too.

18:25.845 --> 18:28.328
A gay Woody is hard to swallow.

18:28.329 --> 18:34.229
Get your mind outta the gutter, Connie.
We need to get to the army base.

18:45.335 --> 18:48.315
This is exactly what I thought
secret government bases were like.

18:48.316 --> 18:50.874
Beefbottom! How are you?

18:50.875 --> 18:52.821
- We need to reverse the...
- What?

18:52.822 --> 18:54.349
We're hoping that you know a way...

18:54.350 --> 18:57.352
- What?
- We need the goddamn antidote.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.432
Oh! Here.

18:59.433 --> 19:02.613
We only have one dose.

19:03.362 --> 19:05.363
Hey, who says you get it?
I'm taking this to Woody.

19:05.364 --> 19:07.029
No, I need it to save Ethel.

19:07.030 --> 19:09.550
Give me that!

19:10.199 --> 19:11.443
[Grunts]

19:11.444 --> 19:13.244
Oh!

19:13.502 --> 19:15.976
Oh, look what you did.

19:15.977 --> 19:18.907
That was my last chance to save Ethel.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.275
Ha ha ha! I was just [Bleep] with you.

19:21.276 --> 19:27.176
That wasn't the antidote.
That was a Mai Tai that Bruce made.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.217
Well, where's the real antidote?

19:29.218 --> 19:33.055
There isn't one.
The effects wear off in 24 hours, silly.

19:33.056 --> 19:35.757
What kind of bomb goes away after 24 hours?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.559
Uh, anything Katherine Heigl's in.

19:37.560 --> 19:42.720
So the effects should be
wearing off right about...

19:43.967 --> 19:46.134
What the [Bleep] am I wearing?

19:46.135 --> 19:49.135
[Grunting, exclaiming]

19:51.407 --> 19:53.890
Are you guys feeling straight?

19:53.891 --> 19:55.889
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.245
Five-second rule?

19:57.246 --> 19:59.581
[Grunting, yelling]

19:59.582 --> 20:01.650
[Electric buzzing]

20:01.651 --> 20:04.069
Hey! I'm not gay anymore!

20:04.070 --> 20:07.074
Of course you'd say that.
Crank up the juice!

20:07.075 --> 20:08.504
[Electric buzzing]

20:08.505 --> 20:10.485
[Thud]

20:11.761 --> 20:16.164
Oh, I... I think we're all done here.
Congratulations. You passed.

20:16.165 --> 20:19.204
Oh, no need to thank us
for fixing your friend.

20:19.205 --> 20:21.069
You'll have to come over for
Christmas dinner this year.

20:21.070 --> 20:23.370
Dad, I'm gay again.

20:23.371 --> 20:25.007
Or not.

20:25.008 --> 20:26.848
You know what I'm really
regretting right now.

20:26.849 --> 20:30.929
- Choking our dog to death?
- Yeah.

20:32.015 --> 20:34.297
Thank you for saving my life, Connie.

20:34.298 --> 20:36.793
I'm sorry I caused all this trouble, guys.

20:36.794 --> 20:39.625
Next time, instead of turning everyone gay,

20:39.626 --> 20:43.245
I'm just gonna sneak into Ethel's
cabin and Chloroform her.

20:43.246 --> 20:45.466
[Laughter]

20:46.629 --> 20:47.729
Wait, what?

20:47.730 --> 20:49.590
Aah!
