00:05.999 --> 00:07.876
<i>Yesterday,
Laverne was in a car accident.</i>

00:08.084 --> 00:10.279
<i>It was all we could think about.</i>

00:10.503 --> 00:11.572
How's she doing?

00:11.755 --> 00:12.983
Major head trauma.

00:13.173 --> 00:16.768
We had to place a CVP bolt
to relieve the pressure on her brain.

00:17.052 --> 00:19.168
Now we just cross our fingers and wait.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.503
<i>Everyone deals
with heartache differently.</i>

00:21.723 --> 00:23.953
<i>Some of us did something
life-affirming.</i>

00:28.438 --> 00:30.508
What is that, like, four times?

00:30.732 --> 00:32.006
Let's see.

00:40.575 --> 00:41.803
Five.

00:41.993 --> 00:44.029
I'm still sad. Again.

00:46.289 --> 00:48.644
<i>Others resorted to childish mischief.</i>

00:48.875 --> 00:51.673
I love mailbox baseball.
Here comes his house.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.718
I've been wanting to do this
for six years!

01:01.054 --> 01:02.692
Nice try, Turkleton,

01:02.889 --> 01:05.357
but Enid kept taking out the mailbox
with the motor-home,

01:05.600 --> 01:07.989
so I had it reinforced with titanium.

01:11.356 --> 01:12.914
Beautiful morning.

01:13.733 --> 01:17.089
<i>And some people just needed
to do something impulsive.</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:21.324
There. Nobody liked my haircut,
so now they can all just suck it.

01:21.616 --> 01:23.015
Yeah, you win.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.163
God, I can't believe
I'm getting my C-section today.

01:27.414 --> 01:30.292
Did you forget to tell anyone?

01:30.542 --> 01:31.611
No.

01:31.793 --> 01:33.704
I told the nanny to stay overnight,

01:33.920 --> 01:36.070
and my mom booked a flight
for next week,

01:36.297 --> 01:39.528
and I'm meeting the O.B.
at the hospital in two hours.

01:40.885 --> 01:43.240
- No...
- Did I not tell you?

01:43.471 --> 01:44.699
You did not.

01:44.889 --> 01:47.039
I could have sworn I texted you.

01:47.267 --> 01:48.416
Well, it's for the best,

01:48.601 --> 01:51.069
'cause if you knew, you just would get
all panicky and annoying.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.667
And this way you only have to freak out
for a couple of hours,

01:53.898 --> 01:56.207
most of which I'll be unconscious.

01:56.443 --> 01:57.717
Kind of like our honeymoon.

01:57.902 --> 01:59.620
Except this time when you wake up,

01:59.821 --> 02:01.254
you're going to have
a baby girl in your arms

02:01.448 --> 02:03.598
instead of the Bolivian limbo champion.

02:03.825 --> 02:06.737
Oh, Marco! What a cheeky monkey!

02:06.995 --> 02:09.304
How come we don't travel any more?

02:10.707 --> 02:13.585
<i>Carla had the difficult job
of talking to Laverne's family.</i>

02:13.835 --> 02:16.110
So there's a chance
she may never wake up?

02:16.337 --> 02:19.454
Well, Lester,
we just don't know that yet.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.971
<i>I wish there was an easier way
to break bad news to people.</i>

02:25.847 --> 02:27.917
So, what's wrong with me, Doc?

02:28.141 --> 02:32.339
Mr Gubard, I think it would be best
if we brought in the Bad News Robot.

02:35.231 --> 02:37.461
<i>Hello, random patient.
You have cancer.</i>

02:37.692 --> 02:39.523
<i>Press "one" for a reassuring pep talk.</i>

02:39.736 --> 02:41.692
<i>Press "two" to give up.</i>

02:43.031 --> 02:45.340
<i>You pressed "one"
for a reassuring pep talk.</i>

02:45.575 --> 02:47.884
<i>You are strong, you can beat this,</i>

02:48.119 --> 02:50.952
<i>beat this, beat this, beat this, beat...</i>

02:53.583 --> 02:55.016
Stupid robot!

02:58.922 --> 03:02.551
I'm so sorry, but your father's
had a massive systems failure.

03:02.842 --> 03:04.673
<i>Oh, Daddy, no!</i>

03:04.886 --> 03:09.198
It started in his hard drive and then
worked its way to all the other circuits.

03:09.516 --> 03:12.588
I know this is a very difficult time
for you and...

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.695 --> 03:24.970
Sure, disintegrate the messenger.

03:25.865 --> 03:27.617
Dude, I need to talk to you.

03:29.119 --> 03:31.474
Dr Wen kept referring to her
as "the patient,"

03:31.705 --> 03:34.424
and I was like, "That's not 'the patient,'
that's Laverne," you know?

03:34.666 --> 03:35.781
I know.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.335
Dude.

04:08.074 --> 04:10.907
You've taught me so much
over the years, Laverne,

04:11.161 --> 04:13.629
like how to place an IV without bruising

04:13.872 --> 04:15.703
or how to get lab results back faster

04:15.915 --> 04:18.873
or the fact that when white people
come in out of the rain,

04:19.127 --> 04:20.845
we smell like wet dog.

04:21.046 --> 04:22.195
We do.

04:24.507 --> 04:25.986
We really do.

04:29.220 --> 04:33.736
I went to your desk
and got you your favourite makeup.

04:35.894 --> 04:38.408
You're such a beautiful woman,
Laverne.

04:39.689 --> 04:42.249
You always deserve to look your best.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.048
Thank you.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.867
Checking in on her?

04:51.076 --> 04:53.192
I just want to make sure
she knows how much I care about her.

04:53.411 --> 04:55.003
As long as you're not saying goodbye.

04:55.205 --> 04:57.514
I mean,
people have come back from worse.

04:57.749 --> 04:59.307
Remember Mr Chuang?

04:59.501 --> 05:02.538
Slipped into a coma in 1984,
woke up last month.

05:06.508 --> 05:09.022
Hey, ladies, where's the beef?

05:10.303 --> 05:13.056
I'm just saying let's keep the faith.

05:14.474 --> 05:15.509
Yeah.

05:19.771 --> 05:22.649
Don't let her put
no more makeup on me.

05:22.899 --> 05:24.890
I look like a street-walker.

05:30.448 --> 05:33.485
Say, Bob, how's Laverne doing?

05:34.327 --> 05:36.841
No change. She's still unresponsive.

05:38.748 --> 05:42.457
Are you on call tonight
or will you be busy fighting Superman?

05:44.003 --> 05:46.437
- You look like Lex Luthor.
- I get it.

05:51.469 --> 05:52.584
- Sylvia!
- Yes!

05:52.762 --> 05:53.911
We've got some super-secret news.

05:54.097 --> 05:55.086
- Hit me!
- Sugar plum?

05:55.265 --> 05:56.983
They're scooping
the baby out of me today.

05:57.183 --> 05:58.980
- You guys...
- Don't say it.

06:00.186 --> 06:01.585
Don't even think it.

06:01.771 --> 06:04.126
<i>He's in my head. I love it.</i>

06:04.357 --> 06:06.587
I'm only telling you this
because we need a favour.

06:06.818 --> 06:08.251
Anything. Just three quick questions.

06:08.445 --> 06:09.400
Did you do that to your head

06:09.571 --> 06:11.004
so your baby will think
everybody looks like that?

06:11.197 --> 06:13.347
Can I be the godfather?
And why is this a secret?

06:13.575 --> 06:15.770
I'm going to answer the first two
with the same sentence.

06:15.994 --> 06:17.347
Stop making dumb jokes.

06:17.537 --> 06:20.847
And it is a secret because Jordan had
pre-natal surgery for hydronephrosis,

06:21.124 --> 06:22.762
and we want to make sure
everything's okay with the kid

06:22.959 --> 06:24.153
before we start spreading the word.

06:24.335 --> 06:27.213
You guys,
your baby is going to be just fine.

06:27.464 --> 06:29.534
Thanks, now all our fears are gone.

06:30.425 --> 06:31.494
Here's what I need you to do.

06:31.676 --> 06:34.395
<i>Oh, my God, Dr Cox
is letting me into his inner circle.</i>

06:34.637 --> 06:36.946
<i>He wants... No, he needs my help.</i>

06:37.182 --> 06:40.174
<i>If you do this right,
next stop, godfather.</i>

06:40.435 --> 06:41.709
<i>Wait, what did he say?</i>

06:42.020 --> 06:43.294
We're ready for you.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.038
Can you manage that?

06:45.231 --> 06:46.266
<i>Ask him to repeat it.</i>

06:46.441 --> 06:47.920
<i>No, no, no,
then he'll know you weren't listening</i>

06:48.109 --> 06:49.178
<i>and he'll never trust you again.</i>

06:49.360 --> 06:50.918
I'm on it, Perry.

06:54.657 --> 06:56.648
What's going on? I mean...

06:56.868 --> 06:58.460
You can't be a ghost, you're not dead.

06:58.661 --> 07:00.777
- Damn right, I'm not dead.
- Then why are you here?

07:00.997 --> 07:03.716
Sugar, you're the one imagining me.
It's up to you to figure that out.

07:03.958 --> 07:06.631
- Dr Cox, nice head.
- Thanks.

07:06.878 --> 07:09.392
This may be a strange question, but...

07:11.549 --> 07:15.667
Have you ever had the memory
of someone follow you around,

07:15.970 --> 07:17.608
kind of like

07:17.847 --> 07:19.075
a ghost?

07:19.391 --> 07:20.426
No.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.353
But, then again, I'm a sane person.

07:23.728 --> 07:25.047
Okay.

07:26.689 --> 07:27.804
Liar.

07:28.483 --> 07:31.361
Hi, Dr Cox! I got pregnant in heaven.

07:31.736 --> 07:33.692
Who knew that could happen?

07:33.947 --> 07:35.096
Come on.

07:37.409 --> 07:38.808
<i>I figured Dr Berman,</i>

07:38.993 --> 07:40.346
<i>the hospital audiologist,
could help me.</i>

07:40.537 --> 07:41.492
Hey, Ed.

07:41.663 --> 07:45.053
I read once that audiologists
can read lips. Is that true?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.322
Actually, yes.

07:46.501 --> 07:47.980
It's surprisingly easy to learn
if you just...

07:48.169 --> 07:50.125
I don't need your life story, Ed.

07:50.338 --> 07:52.135
Can you help me reconstruct
what someone said

07:52.340 --> 07:54.217
if I remember
what their lips looked like?

07:54.426 --> 07:55.654
I'll give it a shot.

07:55.844 --> 07:58.074
Okay, let's remember his mouth.

08:03.685 --> 08:05.994
Now, let me get into character.

08:08.231 --> 08:14.101
Hating the world, clenching my jaw,
wishing I could love J.D. a little more.

08:18.658 --> 08:21.092
Well, I think what he said was...

08:22.078 --> 08:23.716
<i>For a minute there
I was in real trouble.</i>

08:23.913 --> 08:26.381
<i>I would have to
kiss being godfather goodbye,</i>

08:26.624 --> 08:29.775
<i>which reminds me of that time
my godfather kissed me goodbye.</i>

08:30.045 --> 08:32.605
<i>He always had crumbs
in his soul patch.</i>

08:32.839 --> 08:34.794
<i>Wait, has he been talking
this whole time?</i>

08:35.008 --> 08:36.645
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

08:36.842 --> 08:41.155
I said, I think it's,
"Pick up some film for my camera. "

08:41.472 --> 08:42.905
Good work, Ed.

08:45.977 --> 08:49.731
You know,
she once told me I'd have a happy life,

08:50.023 --> 08:53.698
and she said it with a straight face.

08:56.279 --> 08:58.190
You were the one woman I'd never do,

08:58.406 --> 09:01.921
because I respect you too much
and you're kind of a big gal.

09:02.952 --> 09:06.262
But if doing you right now could help,
I would.

09:06.915 --> 09:09.349
I'd like to say something in private.

09:09.834 --> 09:12.473
- I love you.
- Okay. Yeah, it's all right.

09:15.715 --> 09:18.229
I probably should have said this
to you before,

09:18.468 --> 09:20.026
but you always impressed me,

09:20.220 --> 09:22.256
your compassion, your faith.

09:22.472 --> 09:24.428
And you didn't get mad at me
when I insisted

09:24.641 --> 09:26.950
that I should be the lifeguard
at your above-ground pool party,

09:27.185 --> 09:31.144
even after I made it painfully obvious
that I'm not a strong swimmer.

09:31.731 --> 09:35.121
If you see your dog up there,
please tell him I'm sorry.

09:39.447 --> 09:40.675
What are you doing?

09:40.865 --> 09:42.139
I wanted to share a few words

09:42.325 --> 09:44.520
before she passed through
the golden doors of Valhalla.

09:44.744 --> 09:45.699
What now?

09:45.870 --> 09:48.782
I converted to the Norse religion
a few years ago.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.837
It just made sense.

09:52.585 --> 09:55.179
That's it! No more goodbyes, okay?

09:55.422 --> 09:58.732
She's not getting any better,
but she's not getting any worse, either.

09:59.008 --> 10:00.521
No more!

10:03.388 --> 10:06.744
I sure love it
when you get your sass on, girl!

10:15.525 --> 10:18.437
- There. There's my girl.
- How is she? How's the baby?

10:18.695 --> 10:21.528
We got your daughter into the NICU,
and her lungs look great.

10:21.781 --> 10:24.249
Like we discussed, she'll need
another surgery in a couple of months,

10:24.492 --> 10:26.881
but all in all, everything is better
than we could have hoped for.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.189
Listen, Doc, we're not comfortable

10:28.371 --> 10:30.089
letting people see
our emotional moments,

10:30.290 --> 10:33.600
so if you just turn around for a second,
that'd be great.

10:37.172 --> 10:38.730
Okay, we're good.

10:42.969 --> 10:44.846
Nurse Roberts.

10:46.264 --> 10:48.732
You were always one of the good ones.

10:55.982 --> 10:59.019
- What the hell?
- We did it once.

10:59.277 --> 11:02.269
Twenty-some odd years ago,
before Mr Roberts.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.646
- Did I not tell you that?
- No!

11:06.284 --> 11:08.923
He love him some brown sugar.

11:14.334 --> 11:18.327
- That look only works for black guys.
- Then why are you sporting it?

11:21.966 --> 11:25.117
- How'd it go?
- Everyone's doing well.

11:25.387 --> 11:27.662
<i>Though you'd prefer
to give him a full body hug,</i>

11:27.889 --> 11:29.845
<i>just go with a slight nod.</i>

11:31.059 --> 11:33.095
<i>And now the coup de grace.</i>

11:33.311 --> 11:35.506
I got you some film for your camera.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.561
Thanks, I guess.

11:37.774 --> 11:39.765
Did you pick my son up at daycare?

11:39.984 --> 11:41.099
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

11:41.277 --> 11:44.155
<i>"Pick up my son from daycare. "</i>

11:44.406 --> 11:46.283
<i>Damn it, it fits!</i>

11:46.491 --> 11:48.880
- Taken care of, Per-Per.
- Attaboy!

11:49.119 --> 11:51.917
<i>Luckily, I can walk
and text simultaneously.</i>

11:56.960 --> 11:58.473
It's game time!

12:00.797 --> 12:03.595
All right, Newbie,
it is time to tell the masses.

12:03.842 --> 12:05.036
Do me a favour, try not to tear up.

12:05.218 --> 12:08.972
<i>Sometimes even the best news
can be disrupted by a stupid chart.</i>

12:09.264 --> 12:11.778
Is that Laverne's latest CAT scan?
How's it look?

12:12.016 --> 12:14.974
<i>And when that chart
has the worst news of all,</i>

12:15.228 --> 12:17.583
<i>there's only one thing left to do.</i>

12:26.906 --> 12:28.339
Bye, Laverne.

12:30.952 --> 12:32.670
That can't be good.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.134
<i>Laverne was brain dead,</i>

12:39.335 --> 12:41.724
<i>so when her family
decided to take her off life support,</i>

12:41.963 --> 12:44.477
<i>all we could do
was wait for her body to give up.</i>

12:44.716 --> 12:47.276
<i>I couldn't help but think of
the first time I had dealt with death</i>

12:47.510 --> 12:49.262
<i>and how Laverne had been there
for me.</i>

12:49.471 --> 12:51.587
No way anyone could have caught it.

12:51.806 --> 12:55.037
- Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.
- But why didn't anybody page me?

12:55.310 --> 12:57.505
Could you just pronounce him
so I can go home?

13:01.483 --> 13:03.997
You can finally go home, Laverne.

13:04.235 --> 13:08.433
He did not just say that. Too cheesy!

13:10.075 --> 13:12.031
Hey, Carla,
I can get someone to cover for you

13:12.243 --> 13:14.632
if you want to take some time
to say goodbye.

13:14.871 --> 13:16.589
I've got stuff to do.

13:24.172 --> 13:28.051
Per, I am drugged up on pain killers,

13:28.343 --> 13:31.892
I've ironed my hair, I've got that
brand new picture of the baby.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.172
I am ready for the flood of well-wishers.

13:35.433 --> 13:38.982
Buttercup, this is not our child.

13:39.854 --> 13:42.209
Yeah, ours still looks like a lizard.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.873
I got this off the Internet.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.865
I think it's some baby
that Luke Wilson had with a hooker.

13:47.112 --> 13:48.431
Fantastic.

13:48.947 --> 13:50.778
I'm going to go spread the word!

13:50.990 --> 13:52.981
Look at you, squish-nose.

13:54.035 --> 13:55.866
Okay, the fastest way
to spread the news

13:56.079 --> 13:57.478
is to tell the gals in Radiology,

13:57.664 --> 14:00.303
because you know
how Joanne and Rhonda are.

14:01.042 --> 14:02.919
"Oh, there's Dr Dorian, he's so hot. "

14:03.128 --> 14:04.766
"I agree!" "No, you don't, he's mine!"

14:04.963 --> 14:07.761
That's Rhonda, by the way.
Joanne, horse face.

14:08.258 --> 14:10.852
I'm not telling anyone
that my daughter has been born.

14:11.094 --> 14:12.607
But you just told Jordan
that you were going to.

14:12.804 --> 14:14.840
Yes, and that's what we call a lie

14:15.056 --> 14:17.809
or, when you're married,
communication.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.287
Come on, Newbie, you and I both know

14:19.477 --> 14:21.593
Laverne's not going to be around
a whole lot longer.

14:21.813 --> 14:24.281
And I know this reasoning's
about as rational

14:24.524 --> 14:28.642
as your parents actually thinking
they could raise you as a boy, but...

14:29.446 --> 14:34.076
I don't want the birth of my child
to be forever associated with her death,

14:34.451 --> 14:36.567
and that's why
I'm not going to tell anybody anything

14:36.786 --> 14:38.458
until after she passes.

14:38.663 --> 14:39.982
Now, I...

14:40.165 --> 14:42.201
I just got to figure out
how to stall Jordan.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.452
I can help.

14:43.626 --> 14:44.979
What, like you helped pick up my son?

14:45.170 --> 14:46.967
He got home, didn't he?

15:00.518 --> 15:03.191
Some say speed metal
can be very soothing.

15:03.438 --> 15:05.156
Since I already know about it, right,

15:05.356 --> 15:07.312
why don't I go in there
and make a big show,

15:07.525 --> 15:10.164
give her some J.D. razzle-dazzle,
some jazz hands.

15:10.403 --> 15:13.281
That way she'll forget all about
how no one's come to congratulate her

15:13.531 --> 15:15.761
on the arrival
of little baby Jennifer Dylan.

15:15.992 --> 15:17.823
- Why that name?
- I just think it's pretty.

15:18.036 --> 15:20.152
<i>And she'd be "J.D." forever.</i>

15:24.834 --> 15:26.745
You know, Laverne,
if this were a horror flick,

15:26.961 --> 15:29.429
I'd be so scared that I was next.

15:30.256 --> 15:33.009
They always kill the black folks off first.

15:34.677 --> 15:36.554
No, I'm not really worried about it,

15:36.763 --> 15:38.481
'cause there's still
Snoop Dogg Resident

15:38.681 --> 15:41.149
and Leonard the security guard and...

15:42.894 --> 15:46.045
You know, when you think about it,
this is a white-ass hospital.

15:52.028 --> 15:53.700
I'm going to miss you,

15:55.031 --> 15:56.862
so you take care, okay?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.536
Turk, Carla's really having
a hard time with all this.

16:07.752 --> 16:09.231
I think she needs help.

16:09.421 --> 16:10.649
Okay, let's go.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.194
But this is going to suck so,
since you're her best friend,

16:13.425 --> 16:15.097
you should do all the talking.

16:15.301 --> 16:16.575
Turk, you should do it.

16:16.761 --> 16:20.231
Oh, no, I'm just her husband.
You guys are way closer.

16:22.475 --> 16:25.387
Could you just do me a favour
and go away?

16:25.645 --> 16:28.284
I'm an extension of your psyche.

16:28.523 --> 16:31.515
All you have to do
is close your eyes and think me away.

16:31.901 --> 16:33.050
Okay.

16:38.658 --> 16:41.047
I can see you
crouching under the table.

16:41.286 --> 16:42.321
Damn.

16:42.495 --> 16:44.804
Hey, baby?

16:45.040 --> 16:46.632
Laverne's getting weaker by the minute

16:46.833 --> 16:48.266
and we thought
you might want to come back up.

16:48.460 --> 16:49.779
I don't know.

16:51.713 --> 16:53.351
You know, Carla,

16:53.548 --> 16:56.745
when I was 12 years old,
I had this math teacher, Mr Creighton.

16:57.010 --> 16:59.570
Anyway, he used to give us
these pop quizzes all the time.

16:59.804 --> 17:02.443
Not about math. They were literally
quizzes about soda pop.

17:02.682 --> 17:04.115
So, once, the question was,

17:04.309 --> 17:06.345
"What was Mountain Dew's
original name?"

17:06.560 --> 17:07.960
So, I wrote Mountain Mist,

17:08.146 --> 17:09.420
and then my best friend,
Cindy MacNamara,

17:09.606 --> 17:10.560
cheated off my paper,

17:10.732 --> 17:12.768
but it was the wrong answer,
because it was a trick question.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.737
Mountain Dew
was always called Mountain Dew.

17:15.987 --> 17:17.704
Although, little-known fact,

17:17.906 --> 17:21.057
<i>Mr Pibb, originally called
Senor Brown Water...</i>

17:23.243 --> 17:25.553
The point is,
Cindy got the answer wrong,

17:25.789 --> 17:29.418
she failed the course and
she had to go to a dumb-girl school.

17:30.835 --> 17:34.544
I never even got to sign her yearbook.

17:34.839 --> 17:37.831
Okay! I'm just guessing,

17:38.093 --> 17:40.653
but what I think Elliot's saying is,

17:40.887 --> 17:43.003
you should probably say goodbye
to the people you care about

17:43.223 --> 17:44.212
when you have the chance.

17:44.391 --> 17:45.380
Yeah.

17:45.558 --> 17:47.992
Maybe that's why
you imagined me here,

17:48.561 --> 17:50.870
because you don't want to do that.

17:51.523 --> 17:53.354
I'm just going to shut up.

17:55.276 --> 17:57.312
<i>All right, you want to seal
the godfather deal?</i>

17:57.529 --> 18:00.043
<i>Make Jordan feel like she's
the first woman to ever give birth.</i>

18:00.281 --> 18:02.158
<i>Congratulate hard or go home.</i>

18:04.869 --> 18:06.905
That's French for
"Is there a mama in the house?"

18:07.122 --> 18:09.590
Wow, do you look hot
for a woman who just got gutted.

18:09.833 --> 18:10.868
Can you believe it, Per?

18:11.042 --> 18:12.873
Are you with me? You are! I know I am.

18:13.086 --> 18:16.123
What's that smell?
That's the sweet scent of after-birth.

18:16.381 --> 18:19.976
Jordan, I am so happy to be in your life
and these are for you.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.579
<i>You are in the zone.</i>

18:21.761 --> 18:23.752
<i>Now, bring it home
with an emotional voice crack</i>

18:23.972 --> 18:25.451
<i>to show the depth of your love.</i>

18:25.640 --> 18:28.598
I am so happy for you.

18:28.852 --> 18:30.126
<i>Bravo!</i>

18:31.229 --> 18:34.346
When are the people I actually
give a crap about showing up?

18:35.942 --> 18:36.977
You.

18:38.611 --> 18:41.205
I am officially screwed.

18:41.448 --> 18:44.042
Don't sweat it.
There's one more way I could stall.

18:45.118 --> 18:47.473
And now, shadow puppet theatre.

18:53.626 --> 18:55.344
- I'm a dog!
- Lame.

18:55.545 --> 18:57.263
Come on, I'm just getting started.

18:57.464 --> 18:59.136
Gang, places!

19:03.011 --> 19:06.401
Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941.

19:06.681 --> 19:08.717
It started as a peaceful day,

19:08.933 --> 19:10.286
and then...

19:10.727 --> 19:12.843
Aggression from the Japanese!

19:13.229 --> 19:15.584
This is totally unexpected.

19:18.526 --> 19:20.517
<i>Banzai to you, my friend.</i>

19:20.737 --> 19:23.934
Ted! There were no alligators
at Pearl Harbor.

19:24.699 --> 19:28.135
- Oh, man! Battleships are so boring.
- Back to work!

19:30.872 --> 19:32.669
We can also do
the Battle of Gettysburg

19:32.874 --> 19:34.990
<i>or the first act of Miss Saigon.</i>

19:35.210 --> 19:36.768
What the hell am I going to do?

19:36.961 --> 19:38.394
<i>Unfortunately for Dr Cox,</i>

19:38.588 --> 19:42.183
<i>that's when Elliot walked by
and showcased her oddest talent.</i>

19:42.467 --> 19:44.742
Somebody just had a baby.

19:44.969 --> 19:48.120
- How do you know?
- My uterus is glowing.

19:51.184 --> 19:52.776
My mom had a uterus.

19:53.353 --> 19:54.866
I lived in it.

19:56.064 --> 19:59.056
Oh, my God! It was Jordan, wasn't it?

19:59.317 --> 20:02.150
Listen carefully, Barbie,
if you mention this to a soul,

20:02.404 --> 20:04.281
- so help me, I'll...
- Save it!

20:04.489 --> 20:08.004
Not even a killer threat coupled with
that new psychopathic alien head

20:08.284 --> 20:09.956
could keep me from telling the world.

20:10.161 --> 20:12.356
Congratulations! Oh, Perry!

20:14.582 --> 20:16.300
<i>- Yes!
- And there it was.</i>

20:16.501 --> 20:17.934
<i>The birth of Dr Cox's baby</i>

20:18.128 --> 20:20.244
<i>would forever be associated
with Laverne's death.</i>

20:20.463 --> 20:23.102
<i>And the next time
Dr Cox walked into the ICU,</i>

20:23.341 --> 20:25.775
<i>he'd be greeted by a sea of sad faces.</i>

20:27.345 --> 20:28.334
Thank you, Bob.

20:28.513 --> 20:30.469
- Attaboy.
- Janitor.

20:31.975 --> 20:35.172
- Congratulations!
- I knew before everyone.

20:35.437 --> 20:37.234
In your faces! I knew! Tell them, Perry.

20:37.439 --> 20:39.077
It was a long saga...

20:40.108 --> 20:41.063
How...

20:41.568 --> 20:43.365
How's she doing?

20:43.570 --> 20:45.640
- She's hanging on.
- Yeah...

20:45.864 --> 20:48.458
You jerk! Why didn't you tell us?

20:48.700 --> 20:49.849
Well...

20:51.119 --> 20:53.269
Because we all love Laverne
very much.

20:53.496 --> 20:56.533
And I know this is going to sound
selfish and crazy,

20:56.791 --> 20:59.305
but I didn't want everyone
thinking about her dying

20:59.544 --> 21:01.978
every time my daughter has
a birthday party.

21:02.213 --> 21:03.362
And by everyone,

21:03.548 --> 21:06.699
I mean the three of you
I would actually invite to such an event.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.238
No.

21:08.428 --> 21:10.100
A baby is a blessing.

21:10.305 --> 21:12.136
Besides, when it's time
for something to happen,

21:12.348 --> 21:14.145
you've just got to let it happen.

21:14.350 --> 21:17.660
And sometimes it takes a little while
to realise that.

21:19.689 --> 21:20.758
Yeah.

21:22.192 --> 21:23.181
Big dog!

21:23.359 --> 21:26.237
<i>And that's when Carla knew
what she had to do.</i>

21:36.456 --> 21:37.809
Go on, girl.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.266
You can do it.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.359
Wow, I'm still not ready to do this.

21:56.768 --> 22:00.363
It's going to be so weird
not having you by my side every day.

22:02.649 --> 22:07.962
Making fun of the doctors,
going on and on about Jesus.

22:10.657 --> 22:13.694
Man, I hope he's real
or you're going to be pissed.

22:16.121 --> 22:17.998
Remember my first day,

22:18.206 --> 22:21.562
when that patient came in
and started bleeding out on me

22:21.835 --> 22:24.474
and I was so shocked
I could barely move?

22:25.964 --> 22:29.718
But you stood by my side
and you guided me through it.

22:31.803 --> 22:34.761
And then you did
the most amazing thing of all.

22:35.724 --> 22:37.282
You made me laugh.

22:42.605 --> 22:45.802
For the last 15 years,
you've been my role model,

22:47.736 --> 22:50.375
but most of all, you've been my friend.

23:00.415 --> 23:02.975
And I don't know
what else to say except

23:04.878 --> 23:07.267
I'm really, really gonna miss you.

23:14.888 --> 23:16.037
Goodbye.

23:23.563 --> 23:25.155
Come here, baby.

23:29.652 --> 23:31.449
<i>You can ask any doctor.</i>

23:31.654 --> 23:34.293
<i>Sometimes it seems
like patients just hang on</i>

23:34.532 --> 23:37.365
<i>until everyone's
had a chance to say goodbye.</i>

23:44.250 --> 23:46.718
- Here, boys and girls.
- Thanks.

23:47.087 --> 23:49.681
Truth be told, they're on that guy.

23:55.512 --> 23:58.345
<i>Friends have a way
of helping you move on</i>

23:58.598 --> 24:01.635
<i>even if it's as simple
as changing the subject.</i>

24:01.893 --> 24:04.612
Dr Cox, I cannot wait
to see that little baby of yours.

24:04.854 --> 24:05.923
Yeah.

24:06.106 --> 24:09.542
It must be such a madhouse
with everyone visiting Jordan.

24:11.236 --> 24:12.510
What?

24:12.696 --> 24:15.608
I only told you guys
and you guys are all here.

24:18.368 --> 24:21.087
What's the worst that could happen,
right?

24:22.288 --> 24:24.279
They're probably just
forming a line outside

24:24.499 --> 24:26.330
to make sure they come in one by one.

24:26.543 --> 24:29.376
Screw it. You know what?
You're the godfather.

24:29.629 --> 24:32.701
Yes, yes, yes! In your face!

24:32.966 --> 24:36.276
- Can you name her Jennifer Dylan?
- Sure, what the hell.

24:41.474 --> 24:44.944
<i>And, finally,
there was only one thing left to say.</i>

24:46.229 --> 24:47.503
To Laverne.
