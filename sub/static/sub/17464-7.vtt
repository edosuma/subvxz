00:05.482 --> 00:07.194
Previously on Rectify...

00:07.236 --> 00:09.882
No one put words in your mouth.

00:09.883 --> 00:12.378
No one coerced your confession.

00:12.379 --> 00:16.332
I just said what I needed
to say to get out.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.739
I don't want you to have to
sell things to get money.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.740
I'm selling things because
I don't want them, Mom.

00:20.741 --> 00:22.741
I'm trying to simplify my life.

00:22.742 --> 00:23.920
When your mother left...

00:23.921 --> 00:26.526
I sure didn't do what I could have
to save the marriage.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.875
I just hope you do all you can
to save yours.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.031
You go off to your weekly shower,

00:31.032 --> 00:33.599
You can fight it, but you can't stop it.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.262
I guess as quickly as they appear,
they are gone.

00:36.263 --> 00:38.263
The one thing I'm sure of,

00:38.264 --> 00:42.123
is that you are dirty here someunder,
and I'm gonna find out how dirty.

00:42.574 --> 00:44.834
He almost killed you, Daniel.

00:45.215 --> 00:47.668
You can't let him get away
with what he did to you.

00:47.669 --> 00:49.919
Who says that he's getting away with it?

00:51.298 --> 00:53.400
It was lukewarm.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.533
DR. MILCH: The shower?

00:54.534 --> 00:55.796
Yes.

00:56.603 --> 01:00.636
But I would always focus
on the warm instead of the luke.

01:02.042 --> 01:03.562
It was, um...

01:04.444 --> 01:05.739
It was what?

01:06.980 --> 01:08.460
My refuge.

01:08.783 --> 01:12.185
How long has the water been on
on this day, Daniel?

01:12.186 --> 01:14.953
Oh, you only have five minutes
and then the water

01:14.954 --> 01:19.159
automatically shuts off,
so I would try not

01:19.160 --> 01:23.565
to think of the time or where I was.

01:27.635 --> 01:29.092
What's happening now?

01:29.470 --> 01:31.891
I thought it was the guards at first.

01:32.809 --> 01:35.201
But they sounded different somehow.

01:40.547 --> 01:42.986
It was like I knew before I knew.

01:44.373 --> 01:48.086
Try to stay focused
on the event, the experience,

01:48.087 --> 01:52.576
what you feel, what you see,
what you hear in the moment.

01:57.498 --> 02:01.839
Footsteps. I hear footsteps.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.837
Almost as I turn around,
somebody hits me

02:04.838 --> 02:06.287
in the back of the head.

02:06.806 --> 02:07.907
Do you see him?

02:08.609 --> 02:10.668
Now I do. I see all of them.

02:11.544 --> 02:12.745
How many?

02:12.746 --> 02:13.912
Five.

02:13.913 --> 02:15.202
Do you know them?

02:16.216 --> 02:18.508
Four of them... I knew four of them.

02:18.853 --> 02:22.256
One was executed
when I was still inside.

02:22.257 --> 02:22.990
And one was...

02:27.026 --> 02:30.574
One lived right beside me
for more than a decade.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.031
I know it's difficult,

02:33.032 --> 02:35.644
but try to stay in the present tense.

02:38.071 --> 02:42.674
I try to hit him in the face,
but I-I-I can't reach him

02:42.675 --> 02:45.970
because somebody's kicking
my legs out from under me.

02:47.014 --> 02:48.724
I'm on the ground now, and it...

02:49.390 --> 02:51.510
feels like I'm going to sleep.

02:52.441 --> 02:53.819
To sleep?

02:53.820 --> 02:58.225
Someone's cutting off
the blood supply to my brain

02:58.833 --> 03:02.689
and then... darkness.

03:05.246 --> 03:08.873
When I come to, there's, uh...
there's something in my mouth.

03:09.570 --> 03:10.837
Something?

03:10.838 --> 03:13.706
A rag... A dirty washrag.

03:13.707 --> 03:18.179
It tastes of soap
and chlorine and... and me.

03:22.949 --> 03:24.750
What are you experiencing?

03:24.751 --> 03:26.916
Pressure on my neck.

03:27.620 --> 03:34.468
Someone has their, their foot
on my neck and on my back.

03:35.963 --> 03:38.122
They're pulling my legs apart.

03:39.132 --> 03:43.957
I can't move. I can't fight.

03:45.972 --> 03:47.559
I can't scream.

03:51.278 --> 03:56.015
And now there's this weight
on top of me, crushing me.

03:56.016 --> 03:58.232
It's... It's difficult to breathe.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.047
And then...

04:03.702 --> 04:05.162
it starts.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.652
You pray that they will kill you,

04:10.631 --> 04:13.366
that there will be mercy
bestowed upon you

04:13.367 --> 04:15.168
by the merciless.

04:22.875 --> 04:26.462
The water is shut off.
My five minutes are up.

04:28.148 --> 04:31.316
Now I hear everything.

04:31.317 --> 04:33.038
What do you hear?

04:34.120 --> 04:40.993
Grunting and... and... and
laughing and, uh, encouragement.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.362
Encouragement?

04:42.363 --> 04:44.130
Someone giving another encouragement

04:44.131 --> 04:45.832
like a sports team.

04:45.833 --> 04:49.728
"Get it, boy, get it. Get some of that."

04:51.704 --> 04:54.040
Now someone is whining.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.408
"Why do I have to go last?"

04:55.409 --> 04:58.602
"Shut up, asshole, or you'll be next."

05:00.714 --> 05:02.734
Now the weight has been lifted.

05:04.184 --> 05:05.888
I can breathe again.

05:06.854 --> 05:08.191
But then, uh...

05:15.194 --> 05:18.655
someone spreads me apart again
and spits into me.

05:20.867 --> 05:23.701
And then the weight again on top of me.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.043
What is it? What's happening?

05:31.044 --> 05:32.245
(WATER DRIPPING)

05:32.246 --> 05:34.026
I hear it first.

05:34.814 --> 05:36.051
Hear what?

05:36.883 --> 05:38.902
I open my eye,

05:40.319 --> 05:42.798
the one not pressed into the floor.

05:44.391 --> 05:46.858
- What do you see?
- (DRIPPING CONTINUES)

05:46.859 --> 05:49.609
Up above, there's this... this spigot.

05:50.831 --> 05:54.132
Drops from the spigot coming down.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.843
They catch the light just... just so.

05:57.838 --> 06:01.320
They almost look like diamonds
falling from the sky.

06:03.744 --> 06:05.276
They're so close.

06:06.045 --> 06:08.536
I struggle to move my head...

06:09.215 --> 06:10.654
just an inch.

06:11.318 --> 06:13.829
With all my might, less than an inch.

06:15.956 --> 06:19.382
There. Right there.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.103
The drops.

06:24.198 --> 06:27.226
They now fall into my open eye.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.903
Blessed drops...

06:32.806 --> 06:35.141
and I wait for the next,

06:36.910 --> 06:42.380
and the next, and the next.

06:42.381 --> 06:44.575
That's all I see now,

06:45.818 --> 06:47.842
all I hear,

06:51.124 --> 06:52.716

06:56.496 --> 06:58.639
Nothing else is real.

I went to work with you,

still, in some way,

15:13.676 --> 15:18.180
And you are (SIGH) not as tough
as you act, lady.

15:18.181 --> 15:19.212
(LAUGHS)

15:19.213 --> 15:21.316
That stays between us.

15:23.919 --> 15:25.288
Um...

15:26.385 --> 15:28.915
I'm not seeing a lot of
packing around here.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.855
I thought I would finish my book first.

15:31.856 --> 15:33.325
Your thousand-page book?

15:33.326 --> 15:34.827
838.

15:34.828 --> 15:36.562
Okay.

15:36.563 --> 15:39.670
I am a better leaver than a packer.

15:46.305 --> 15:47.939
So, what are you taking?

15:47.940 --> 15:49.908
I don't know. (CHUCKLES)

15:49.909 --> 15:52.644
A U-Haul trailer's worth,
dealer's choice.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.947
- Art?
- No, he stays.

15:54.948 --> 15:56.684
(CHUCKLES)

15:58.684 --> 15:59.752
Paintings?

16:00.386 --> 16:02.557
Most of it, I'll leave
for the new occupant.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.965
It's kinda the lofty
tradition around here.

16:06.659 --> 16:08.387
That's why there's so much of it.

16:09.529 --> 16:11.029
Can I just pack one box?

16:11.030 --> 16:13.465
- No, no, no, no.
- Just... Just one item.

16:13.466 --> 16:17.635
One item you would like to see
in your new room in Ohio land.

16:17.636 --> 16:18.904
Not my sister.

16:18.905 --> 16:22.740
That is not an item.
That's a not not person.

16:22.741 --> 16:24.578
(LAUGHS)

16:28.048 --> 16:29.362
No, it stays.

16:35.554 --> 16:36.749
Maybe.

16:38.091 --> 16:40.361
Okay, sure.

16:42.062 --> 16:44.664
It needs to be wrapped.

(PAPER CRINKLES)

16:56.909 --> 16:58.348
Do I have to help you?

16:59.011 --> 17:00.894
Probably at some point.

17:01.381 --> 17:02.587
But not now.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.189
Enjoy your book.

17:11.458 --> 17:14.461
Nothing, Mother.
It's just supply and demand.

17:16.429 --> 17:17.628
Hey, honey.

17:17.630 --> 17:22.867
Good Lord. There's so much less.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.135
I sold my bike today.

17:24.136 --> 17:26.105
Well, Jared and I did.

17:26.106 --> 17:27.521
Good for y'all.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.442
Do you want your Legos?

17:30.443 --> 17:31.320
What?

17:32.544 --> 17:34.980
I don't know. Maybe.

17:35.582 --> 17:36.914
Do I have to decide right now?

17:36.915 --> 17:38.549
There's no rush.

17:38.550 --> 17:41.519
I was just gonna take a few
bags to Goodwill tomorrow,

17:41.520 --> 17:43.022
so I was just wondering.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.424
- Goodwill?
- Look, they're too beat up to eBay.

17:46.425 --> 17:47.625
Pretty much the only thing people want

17:47.626 --> 17:49.697
is mint, new, in-box.

17:51.257 --> 17:55.595
First, I don't want anyone
eBaying or Goodwilling my shit.

17:57.737 --> 17:58.909
No problem.

17:59.472 --> 18:01.406
I'm glad you're moving on, Mom.

18:01.407 --> 18:03.015
If that's what's happening here.

18:04.978 --> 18:09.114
Just kinda need a warning of
which Janet I'm gonna get...

18:09.115 --> 18:11.048
the one who's moving on or the one

18:11.049 --> 18:13.152
who's still knee-deep in her shit.

18:13.153 --> 18:15.854
Because it seems I never get
to be a part of the good times.

18:15.855 --> 18:18.456
In fact, I usually get
the Janet that wants me

18:18.457 --> 18:21.527
to get knee-deep in the shit with her.

18:21.528 --> 18:23.162
Hey, you shouldn't
talk to her like that.

18:23.163 --> 18:25.029
It's okay, Jared.

18:25.030 --> 18:26.597
No, it's not okay.

18:26.598 --> 18:27.965
No, I'm glad that you're enjoying

18:27.966 --> 18:30.202
your mother being
present for you, Jared.

18:30.203 --> 18:31.514
Savor it.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.565
Where's my dad's Army jacket?

18:40.078 --> 18:42.164
I put it in the cedar chest.

18:44.983 --> 18:47.226
Did something happen today, honey?

18:48.053 --> 18:49.488
(SIGHS)

18:49.489 --> 18:51.123
Nothing negative,

18:51.124 --> 18:53.192
if that's what you're implying.

18:53.193 --> 18:57.061
In fact, it was
extraordinarily positive.

18:57.062 --> 19:00.598
Bobby Dean personally apologized
to me at the roller skating rink

19:00.599 --> 19:03.255
for nearly killing your oldest son.

He's evidently real
torn up about it, too.

Bless his heart.

Oh, and this is for you

21:23.105 --> 21:26.142
Yeah, just, uh, once in a while.

21:29.878 --> 21:32.402
I'll quit again after
everything settles down.

21:42.657 --> 21:43.924
The house?

21:43.925 --> 21:46.126
She was asking about us.

21:46.127 --> 21:47.389
Fishing.

21:48.336 --> 21:49.998
Not surprising, knowing Janet.

21:49.999 --> 21:52.631
I told her that we're getting a divorce.

21:53.761 --> 21:56.200
I couldn't lie. I didn't want to.

21:57.703 --> 21:59.072
I understand.

21:59.073 --> 22:02.076
She says she's not gonna tell
your dad anything

Okay.

22:12.687 --> 22:14.155
Want a Coke?

22:14.156 --> 22:17.017
Or... Or a water. Doesn't matter.

22:17.018 --> 22:18.560
Okay.

I think we're each supposed to have one.

22:32.741 --> 22:34.910
Oh. Right.

22:37.245 --> 22:38.736
Could get a mediator.

22:40.049 --> 22:42.317
I mean, they're not set up
to be contentious

22:42.318 --> 22:44.136
like lawyers can be.

22:44.843 --> 22:46.381
Just another way to go.

22:48.813 --> 22:50.479
I like that.

22:51.694 --> 22:53.126
Want me to look into it?

22:53.127 --> 22:55.027
Or... Or I can.

Okay.

Why don't you do that?

23:01.889 --> 23:03.791
(CHUCKLES)

23:08.077 --> 23:11.203
Told Dad I didn't want to be
in the tire business anymore.

23:12.175 --> 23:13.555
Oh, really?

23:18.354 --> 23:20.501
How did he react?

23:21.357 --> 23:23.909
You know Dad...
keeps it close to the vest,

23:23.910 --> 23:27.627
but I know he's disappointed.

23:27.628 --> 23:30.390
(CLEARS THROAT)

23:30.768 --> 23:33.771
I basically told him
he wasn't responsible

23:33.772 --> 23:36.607
for my happiness and I wasn't for his.

23:36.608 --> 23:38.606
That took a lot of courage, Teddy.

23:38.607 --> 23:42.211
I don't know. Just needed to be said.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.811
Long time coming.

23:45.481 --> 23:47.241
What do you think you might do?

23:50.853 --> 23:53.488
Go work for the man, I guess...

23:53.489 --> 23:55.757
some man who's not my
father and stepmother.

23:55.758 --> 23:57.759
Let him worry about the big picture.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.371
I don't know for sure yet.

24:00.495 --> 24:04.398
Might take some time off.
Go see my mom, maybe.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.893
Have you talked to her?

24:06.603 --> 24:09.506
Not yet. I probably will.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.709
How 'bout you?

24:13.710 --> 24:15.219
Thought about your future any?

24:16.878 --> 24:20.481
I have. (CHUCKLES)

24:20.482 --> 24:24.506
I believe that, um, that God
wants me to serve people, Teddy.

24:25.722 --> 24:27.289
Okay.

24:27.290 --> 24:30.953
Help people... wash their feet,
so to speak.

24:33.428 --> 24:37.898
I mean, I'm gonna finish
my nursing degree first,

24:37.899 --> 24:41.502
and then I don't know, maybe join

24:41.503 --> 24:44.839

or something like that.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.128
Just try and do some good in the world.

24:48.911 --> 24:50.517
It sounds like you got a plan.

24:51.414 --> 24:53.073
I've been praying on it.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.984
And I believe that God
has given me my answer.

24:56.985 --> 24:58.646
I really do.

24:59.622 --> 25:01.237
That's great, Tawney.

25:02.558 --> 25:04.393
You think I'm daft.

25:04.394 --> 25:08.388
No. Just the opposite.

25:09.898 --> 25:12.459
I can definitely see you
doing something like that.

25:13.069 --> 25:16.993
I can see it so clearly,
I can actually see it.

25:18.374 --> 25:19.756
Thank you, Teddy.

25:20.443 --> 25:21.855
That means a lot.

You want to go get some

25:33.856 --> 25:35.456
- Not the pizza but...
- (LAUGHS)

25:35.457 --> 25:38.091
Nothing attached to us
going to get pizza, just...

25:42.632 --> 25:45.579
I'd like to spend some time
with you before it all changes.

25:46.903 --> 25:48.434
I think that'd be all right.

25:49.905 --> 25:52.103
I've got about an hour. Is that okay?

25:53.076 --> 25:54.631
It is okay.

25:58.481 --> 26:01.184
Why wasn't Chris Nelms
interrogated, Sheriff?

26:01.818 --> 26:04.051
Well, once Holden broke...

26:04.052 --> 26:06.339
Broke or was broken?

26:06.340 --> 26:10.476
Once he confessed,
Roland and I felt like...

26:10.477 --> 26:13.179
Roland especially felt like,

26:13.180 --> 26:16.215
"Why muddy the waters?" at that point.

26:16.216 --> 26:18.100
What would have been the mud?

26:18.485 --> 26:20.218
You know, there were a lot of rumors

26:20.219 --> 26:22.455
going around with the kids.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.422
Rumors about...?

26:24.423 --> 26:26.324
Hanna's behavior.

26:26.325 --> 26:27.601
Sexual behavior?

26:28.127 --> 26:29.362
Yes.

26:29.363 --> 26:30.563
That night?

26:30.564 --> 26:32.597
That night, before that night...

26:32.598 --> 26:34.509
just a lot of talk.

26:35.669 --> 26:37.236
Let's focus on that night.

26:37.237 --> 26:40.038
Um, we began questioning

26:40.039 --> 26:42.440
some of the boys about those rumors.

26:42.441 --> 26:44.243
And that was in between

26:44.244 --> 26:46.645
our continued questioning of Holden.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.448
Boys like George Melton and Trey Willis?

26:49.449 --> 26:52.084
Those were two we focused on.

26:52.085 --> 26:54.387
And what were their responses?

26:54.388 --> 26:57.657
Trey straight up denied having had sex

26:57.658 --> 27:01.593
with Hanna or having seen any other boy

27:01.594 --> 27:03.296
have sex with her.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.530
And George?

27:05.531 --> 27:08.301
Basically the same thing at first,

27:08.302 --> 27:13.672
but George seemed more nervous,
less sure of himself.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.142
It was like he was
being evasive somehow.

27:17.143 --> 27:18.443
Did you press him?

27:18.444 --> 27:20.112
Roland did.

27:20.113 --> 27:22.000
Was Foulkes leading the investigation?

27:22.001 --> 27:23.048
Oh, no, no.

27:23.049 --> 27:26.718
Not leading. Uh, Roland would spell me

27:26.719 --> 27:28.987
from time to time with interrogations.

27:28.988 --> 27:34.360
We were a small department,
and it was all hands on deck.

27:34.361 --> 27:38.363
And what happened when Foulkes
pressed George Melton

27:38.364 --> 27:41.602
on the issue of his possible
sexual activity with Hanna?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.676
What is it, Mr. Pickens?

27:50.677 --> 27:51.897
Um...

27:53.145 --> 27:57.083
Roland felt like George was
nervous because of something

27:57.084 --> 28:00.286
that he might have seen
rather than something

28:00.287 --> 28:02.555
- that he might have done.
- Meaning?

28:02.556 --> 28:05.524
He focused his questions more on whether

28:05.525 --> 28:09.728
George had seen Daniel
doing something to Hanna.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.063
Sexually, you mean?

28:11.064 --> 28:13.632
Yeah, and against her will.

28:13.633 --> 28:15.601
Questioned George or led George?

28:15.602 --> 28:18.536
Well, depends on whether you're talking

28:18.537 --> 28:21.474
in the moment or hindsight.

28:21.475 --> 28:23.110
In the moment.

28:25.011 --> 28:28.279
You get so caught up
in things, Ms. Person,

28:28.280 --> 28:32.250
and you get this idea
about what happened.

28:32.251 --> 28:36.589
And it's like you get
a kind of tunnel vision.

28:36.590 --> 28:38.626
Is that what happened to you, sir?

28:40.594 --> 28:42.988
Roland got more of it than me.

28:43.697 --> 28:45.467
But it was contagious.

28:46.033 --> 28:47.433
I won't lie about that.

28:53.806 --> 28:59.111
Anyway, we took that information

28:59.112 --> 29:01.213
back to where we were holding Daniel.

29:02.114 --> 29:03.716
What information?

29:03.717 --> 29:06.518
That we had an eyewitness
that would testify

29:06.519 --> 29:10.622
that he had seen Daniel raping Hanna.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.357
George being that witness?

29:12.358 --> 29:13.593
Yes.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.162
What was Holden's response?

29:17.163 --> 29:19.230
He denied it at first.

29:19.231 --> 29:21.333
In fact, Daniel Holden
said it was the other boys

29:21.334 --> 29:23.134
who had sex with her, didn't he?

29:23.135 --> 29:25.103
Initially, yes.

29:25.104 --> 29:28.407
And then he came around
to seeing things your way?

29:28.408 --> 29:31.477
He came around to what
we believed to be the truth.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.312
How long did that take, Sheriff?

29:33.313 --> 29:36.382
I don't know, uh, 10 hours.

29:36.383 --> 29:40.318
It was getting to be toward late
afternoon at that point.

29:40.319 --> 29:41.786
And George?

29:41.787 --> 29:43.389
Did you question him any further

29:43.390 --> 29:46.124
about his possible
sexual involvement with Hanna?

29:46.125 --> 29:48.861
I mean, given Daniel's assertion
that it was the other boys

29:48.862 --> 29:51.731
and not Daniel himself
who had sex with her that night.

29:53.232 --> 29:56.202
I fully intended to, Ms. Person.

29:57.636 --> 29:58.837
But?

29:58.838 --> 30:01.606
Once Holden had confessed

30:01.607 --> 30:04.677
to murder, to rape,

30:04.678 --> 30:08.680
Roland felt like that we
should just cut George loose,

30:08.681 --> 30:10.548
cut all the kids loose.

30:10.549 --> 30:12.785
But before that?

30:12.786 --> 30:16.522
Before you cut 'em all loose,
before Daniel broke,

30:16.523 --> 30:19.859
did you question Trey
about George's claim

30:19.860 --> 30:22.527
of rape by Holden?

30:22.528 --> 30:24.162
Roland did.

30:24.163 --> 30:25.831
And what was Trey's response?

30:25.832 --> 30:28.534
- Just sat there.
- Sat there?

30:28.535 --> 30:32.203
Finally, he asked Roland
to repeat what George

30:32.204 --> 30:36.475
had said about seeing Daniel rape Hanna.

30:36.476 --> 30:37.910
And Roland did.

30:37.911 --> 30:39.911
And Trey's response?

30:39.912 --> 30:41.647
He just sat there again,

30:41.648 --> 30:44.549
like he was contemplating something.

30:44.550 --> 30:48.586
Then he said he did not see
any sex at all

30:48.587 --> 30:51.657
between Daniel and Hanna,

30:51.658 --> 30:54.829
just them arguing with each other.

30:57.296 --> 31:00.900
Did Roland press Trey
to confirm George's claim

31:00.901 --> 31:02.767
of sexual assault against Holden?

31:02.768 --> 31:04.269
Oh, of course.

31:04.270 --> 31:05.571
It was to our advantage to have,

31:05.572 --> 31:08.674
uh, another eyewitness to that.

31:08.675 --> 31:12.277
We were pretty sure that Trey
had been hanging out with George

31:12.278 --> 31:14.813
most of the night, so we believed that,

31:14.814 --> 31:17.549
uh, he must have seen something, too.

31:17.550 --> 31:21.586
But the harder that Roland pushed Trey,

31:21.587 --> 31:23.589
the more he dug in.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.324
That he hadn't seen a rape.

31:25.325 --> 31:26.592
That's correct.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.760
But at that point, we felt like

31:28.761 --> 31:31.296
he was deceiving us.

31:31.297 --> 31:34.299
- How so?
- The way he acted so surprised

31:34.300 --> 31:37.736
when we told him what George
had said about the rape

31:37.737 --> 31:40.706
and how careful he was becoming

31:40.707 --> 31:43.308
before he would answer something.

31:43.309 --> 31:45.311
Just didn't feel right.

31:45.312 --> 31:48.479
Didn't feel right.

31:48.480 --> 31:53.318
But, Ms. Person, again, at the time,

31:53.319 --> 31:56.689
in the heat of the moment,
we felt like that

31:56.690 --> 31:59.904
he was just protecting a friend.

32:01.228 --> 32:02.527
A friend?

32:02.528 --> 32:04.864
You know, by not ratting on him.

32:06.932 --> 32:08.834
Daniel being the friend?

32:08.835 --> 32:10.661
Daniel being the friend, yes.

32:19.913 --> 32:22.415
Of course I was gonna talk to Chris.

32:22.416 --> 32:25.084
But, uh...

32:25.085 --> 32:26.105
But?

32:29.023 --> 32:30.457
Roger.

32:30.458 --> 32:32.726
Roger? Who's Roger?

32:32.727 --> 32:36.228
Roger Nelms, Chris Nelms' dad.

32:36.229 --> 32:38.832
What's his part in all this, CJ?

32:38.833 --> 32:40.734
Who's to say for sure?

32:40.735 --> 32:42.702
'Cept maybe Roland.

32:42.703 --> 32:45.139
Well, that's not gonna happen.

32:47.775 --> 32:51.210
But first, Roger took his sweet time

32:51.211 --> 32:54.014
bringing Chris down
to the station that day,

32:54.015 --> 32:56.882
but he was a long-time
supporter of Roland,

32:56.883 --> 33:00.120
good friend, so nobody pushed him.

33:00.121 --> 33:01.955
When father and son finally arrived,

33:01.956 --> 33:06.159
Roger said Chris was not
gonna talk to anyone

33:06.160 --> 33:07.827
without a lawyer present.

33:07.828 --> 33:09.328
That didn't raise red flags?

33:09.329 --> 33:11.131
Sure, it did.

33:11.132 --> 33:13.232
But Roger was a lawyer himself.

33:13.233 --> 33:14.834
So what?

33:14.835 --> 33:18.071
Daniel had already mentioned
Chris' name, hadn't he?

33:18.072 --> 33:20.441
Well, he'd mentioned a Chris.

33:22.410 --> 33:25.445
Did Roger Nelms and Roland
have a conversation

33:25.446 --> 33:27.127
at the station that day?

33:27.815 --> 33:29.022
They did.

33:29.983 --> 33:31.751
Do you know the gist of it?

33:31.752 --> 33:33.461
I wasn't privy to it.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.389
- It was held...
- In a back room?

33:36.390 --> 33:38.157
In private.

33:39.460 --> 33:43.028
Do you think Roger Nelms
knew exactly what Chris,

33:43.029 --> 33:45.364
and maybe others, had done to Hanna

33:45.365 --> 33:48.393
before he brought Chris
to the station that day?

33:51.439 --> 33:54.810
I've thought a lot about
that, Carl, lately.

33:57.812 --> 34:01.413
Roger Nelms had big plans
for his son, Chris.

34:01.414 --> 34:05.885
A serious charge like rape
wasn't part of those plans.

34:05.886 --> 34:10.356
And Chris was afraid of his dad, too.

34:10.357 --> 34:14.360
So, could I see a man like Roger Nelms

34:14.362 --> 34:19.165
holding his 16-year-old
son's feet to the fire

34:19.166 --> 34:24.070
till Chris caved and admitted
what he had done?

34:24.071 --> 34:29.208
Now that's more likely to me
than Chris keeping a lie going

34:29.210 --> 34:31.371
under those same conditions.

34:33.045 --> 34:34.675
But now it's just a guess.

34:38.052 --> 34:39.418
Did Foulkes share with you

34:39.420 --> 34:42.855
any part of his conversation
with Roger Nelms?

34:42.856 --> 34:44.224
He did not.

34:44.225 --> 34:45.424
He said, "Let's just hold off

34:45.425 --> 34:47.511
on talking to Chris officially.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.094
Keep him in our back pocket

34:50.096 --> 34:53.998
and wait and see
if Holden would, um ..."

36:02.636 --> 36:05.237

36:05.238 --> 36:09.242
Because you have a job there
with health insurance

36:14.348 --> 36:16.250

36:54.455 --> 36:57.023
You've un-bored me.

36:57.024 --> 37:01.695
You've given me, if not hope,
hope for hope.

37:01.696 --> 37:06.365
You've given me strength, courage.

37:06.366 --> 37:08.856
No. You already had courage.

37:09.569 --> 37:11.529
You wouldn't have made it
this far if you didn't.

37:14.674 --> 37:19.546

in the long term is...

Is.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.868
I'm 19 years and 8 months away

from not having to see
a probation officer

38:02.156 --> 38:03.773
every other week

38:04.225 --> 38:06.693
and take random urine tests

38:06.694 --> 38:10.796
and notify law enforcement
if I move across the street,

38:10.797 --> 38:13.050
let alone to another state.

three hours a night.

I make $7.85 an hour,
and that's after a raise.

Tawney said she, uh, told you about...

43:41.185 --> 43:43.168
- about our, um...
- She did.

43:43.587 --> 43:44.838
I'm sorry, Teddy.

43:45.989 --> 43:48.404
Hey, what's with the limp?

43:49.393 --> 43:51.263
Hunting accident.

43:57.567 --> 43:59.249
I need to go and tell Dad.

44:00.038 --> 44:02.673
It's not fair for you
to have to sit on this.

44:02.674 --> 44:03.660
I'm okay.

44:05.042 --> 44:07.502
If somebody else finds out,
though, you know?

44:10.647 --> 44:12.355
I just gotta go on and do it.

44:13.384 --> 44:14.920
Get it over with.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.900
He's in the backyard, mulching.

44:18.901 --> 44:20.841
Do you mind being back there with us?

44:22.774 --> 44:24.151
I think it might help.

44:24.910 --> 44:26.523
If you want me to.

44:27.979 --> 44:29.109
I do.

44:29.948 --> 44:31.101
Okay.

44:40.792 --> 44:42.861
(RUSTLING)

44:43.540 --> 44:45.009
Look who showed up.

44:46.097 --> 44:47.721
Hey, Dad.

44:49.167 --> 44:51.067
Just mulching a little bit.

44:51.068 --> 44:54.237
I see that. Looking good out here.

44:54.238 --> 44:56.174
Not like when you cut trees back.

44:56.175 --> 44:57.942
Don't think time of year
matters with mulch,

44:57.943 --> 45:00.578
though I'm sure some TV guy
would tell me different.

45:00.579 --> 45:02.112
Well, I need to do some of that myself,

45:02.113 --> 45:03.880
now that I think about it.

45:03.881 --> 45:05.949
Well, if I got any left,
you're welcome to it.

45:05.950 --> 45:08.109
I'm sure we got plenty at the house.

45:11.856 --> 45:13.825
So, what brings you by?

45:17.963 --> 45:19.846
I need to tell you something, Dad.

45:22.033 --> 45:23.069
Oh, yeah?

45:23.921 --> 45:25.872
There's no good time to do it, really.

45:28.039 --> 45:30.241
I thought I'd wait until after we got

45:30.242 --> 45:32.979
everything with the
store settled, but...

45:36.180 --> 45:39.549
Anyway, Dad,

45:39.550 --> 45:43.862
see, uh, thing is...

45:46.091 --> 45:49.128
Well, go on and tell me,
if you're gonna tell me.

45:52.775 --> 45:55.166
Me and Tawney, uh, you know,

45:55.167 --> 45:58.002
we've been seeing this
lady therapist off and on.

45:59.104 --> 46:01.746
And it's been helping. It really has.

46:02.274 --> 46:04.554
And she's very good at what she does.

46:04.943 --> 46:06.826
You know, empathetic and stuff.

46:09.347 --> 46:11.282
And I think we've both grown from it.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.896
I know we have, in fact.

46:14.318 --> 46:15.466
But...

46:17.256 --> 46:19.471
it's not gonna work out for us, Dad.

46:21.152 --> 46:24.154
And we gave her
a good try, I tell you that.

46:24.155 --> 46:26.485
I mean, we tried just about
as hard as one can.

46:27.291 --> 46:28.946
And I feel good about that.

46:38.170 --> 46:40.630
(VOICE BREAKING)
But we're getting a divorce, Dad.

46:45.476 --> 46:48.722
We love each other, that'll always be.

46:50.849 --> 46:53.182
And she's still family
far as I'm concerned.

46:57.289 --> 46:58.808
But that's just the way it is.

47:02.260 --> 47:04.330
I kind of figured that was it.

47:06.465 --> 47:10.952
You don't hear a lot
of times about couples

47:11.536 --> 47:15.017
coming back together
after they separate.

47:17.608 --> 47:18.995
I guess you don't.

47:20.644 --> 47:22.750
We love you, of course.

47:23.581 --> 47:24.888
Both of you.

47:27.251 --> 47:29.268
We'll support you the best we can.

47:31.188 --> 47:32.542
I appreciate that, Dad.

47:33.072 --> 47:34.390
And it's probably not a good idea

47:34.391 --> 47:37.328
to be alone too much right now.

47:37.329 --> 47:40.844
So, of course, you can come
over here any time you want.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.825
I mean, if it's all right
with your mother.

47:46.271 --> 47:47.770
Absolutely.

47:49.273 --> 47:51.607
Any time, Teddy. We're counting on it.

47:56.748 --> 48:01.110
I'll heed your advice. Thank you, Dad.

48:08.726 --> 48:10.001
Well.

48:13.465 --> 48:15.031
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

48:19.704 --> 48:21.145
I meant Janet.

48:34.219 --> 48:36.224
Thank you for saving money
today at Thrifty Town.

48:37.389 --> 48:39.223
Got any trash?

48:39.224 --> 48:40.424
'Bout half full.

48:40.425 --> 48:42.064
I'll take it.

48:46.331 --> 48:47.566
Amantha.

48:50.902 --> 48:53.203
Hi. (CHUCKLES)

48:53.204 --> 48:54.706
Jenny.

48:56.708 --> 48:58.376
Hey.

48:59.376 --> 49:01.946
I'm sorry I missed you
at the McGuires' shindig.

49:01.947 --> 49:05.716
Mm. You missed a blow out.
Capri Suns and a bounce house.

49:05.717 --> 49:07.807
Billy said it was quite the event.

49:08.519 --> 49:11.589
Well, Mr. Billy was right.

49:11.590 --> 49:12.989
Of course, Natalie always did have

49:12.990 --> 49:14.861
the biggest birthday parties
when she was a kid.

49:15.559 --> 49:17.962
And the tradition continues.

49:17.963 --> 49:19.430
That's right.

49:19.431 --> 49:22.400
I forgot about her birthday events.

49:23.601 --> 49:25.736
I would always come home
from those so depressed.

49:25.737 --> 49:27.705
Yeah, or pissed off.

49:27.706 --> 49:28.973
"Mama, why can't I have a juggler

49:28.974 --> 49:30.607
at my birthday party like Natalie does?"

49:30.608 --> 49:32.942
That's right, she had a juggler
that one time.

49:32.943 --> 49:35.745
- Serious B.O., too.
- That was because of the polyester costume.

49:35.746 --> 49:37.513
Polyester and juggling?

49:37.514 --> 49:40.286
- That's a terrible combo.
- (CHUCKLES)

49:47.858 --> 49:49.813
(VOICE BREAKING) I'm so sorry, Jenny.

49:50.594 --> 49:52.228
There's no reason to be sorry, Amantha.

49:53.530 --> 49:55.399
Except for still being so pretty.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.902
(SCOFFS)

49:59.536 --> 50:02.774
I missed you for like a year
after I quit talking to you.

50:04.708 --> 50:06.546
It hurt my feelings, Amantha.

50:07.846 --> 50:09.665
Terribly. I won't say it didn't.

50:10.648 --> 50:14.350
But Mama said you were trying
the best way you knew how

50:14.351 --> 50:15.819
to deal with a terrible tragedy

50:15.820 --> 50:18.721
and for me not to take it personally.

50:18.722 --> 50:20.340
Which eventually, I didn't.

50:22.427 --> 50:23.960
God, I miss your mama.

50:23.961 --> 50:26.430
She's available if you need
some bossing around some time.

50:26.431 --> 50:28.233
(LAUGHS)

50:31.936 --> 50:36.372
So, were you surprised to hear
that I was working at Thrifty Town?

50:36.373 --> 50:38.341
Surprised? I fainted.

50:38.342 --> 50:39.977
(LAUGHS)

50:39.978 --> 50:41.845
Seriously, when I came to,
I asked why I fainted.

50:41.846 --> 50:43.747
When they told me a second
time, I fainted again.

50:43.748 --> 50:45.684
(LAUGHS)

50:56.459 --> 50:57.793
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

51:00.380 --> 51:01.700
TED SR.: Still soaking.

51:03.215 --> 51:04.608
You'll get all wrinkly.

51:05.217 --> 51:06.745
I'm already wrinkly.

51:10.255 --> 51:12.068
Want me to scrub your back?

51:14.127 --> 51:15.335
I don't mind.

51:16.596 --> 51:17.825
I guess.

51:32.344 --> 51:35.267
That's the one area you can't
reach yourself, i'nt it?

51:37.683 --> 51:39.285
Nope.

51:44.590 --> 51:45.742
Feel good?

51:47.021 --> 51:48.565
It does.

51:51.663 --> 51:53.317
I love you, Ted.

51:59.973 --> 52:02.643
I love you, too, Janet.

(CELLPHONE BEEPS)

52:27.132 --> 52:28.710
What you listening to?

52:30.477 --> 52:32.236
Uh, homework.

52:32.237 --> 52:33.800
For your therapy?

52:35.340 --> 52:36.675
Yes.

52:36.676 --> 52:38.411
Well, that's good, Dan.

52:42.114 --> 52:43.716
Well.

52:45.451 --> 52:48.185
What is it?

52:48.186 --> 52:49.630
Got a job.

- (LAUGHS)

52:53.726 --> 52:55.459
That's great, Pickle.

52:55.460 --> 52:57.662
Working at a dry cleaner's, surprise.

52:57.663 --> 53:00.955
(BOTH LAUGH)

53:01.801 --> 53:03.468
When do you start?

53:03.469 --> 53:04.669
Monday.

53:04.670 --> 53:06.338
You excited?

53:06.339 --> 53:07.759
A little nervous.

53:08.241 --> 53:09.599
Called my mama, of course.

53:09.914 --> 53:10.895
(CHUCKLES)

53:11.344 --> 53:15.213
She pushing 80, but I'm still
her baby, you know?

53:15.214 --> 53:16.314
Yes.

53:16.315 --> 53:18.216
Lord, she carried on, too.

53:18.217 --> 53:20.276
(CHUCKLES) I bet.

53:21.119 --> 53:23.143
Anyway.

53:24.389 --> 53:26.490
We'll probably have
a little celebration,

53:26.491 --> 53:28.160
just the fellas, nothing fancy.

53:28.161 --> 53:29.363
Meat and three.

53:30.195 --> 53:31.296
Meat and three?

53:31.297 --> 53:32.631
That's where you get one meat

53:32.632 --> 53:34.499
and three vegetables... big around here.

53:34.500 --> 53:37.468
Oh, right. Sounds nice.

53:37.469 --> 53:38.835
Hope you can join us.

53:39.272 --> 53:42.639
I wouldn't miss it, Pickle,
not for anything.

53:51.650 --> 53:53.239
How'd your day go?

53:55.755 --> 53:57.937
I helped a friend pack.

53:58.458 --> 54:00.591
Well, that's a gift.

54:03.395 --> 54:06.243
It was. Sure was.

54:07.029 --> 54:10.702
Okay. Well, um, got group in a few.

54:10.703 --> 54:12.260
I'll be there.

I'm on the ground now.

54:54.514 --> 54:56.757
DR. MILCH: To sleep?

there's something in my mouth.

Something?

55:13.732 --> 55:17.202
A rag... A dirty washrag.

It tastes of soap
and chlorine and... and me.

on my neck and on my back.
