By the way, that was slow and easy.

I don't think you should do it.

00:08.113 --> 00:11.247
Most jocks are a bunch
of narcissistic jerks.

00:11.299 --> 00:13.883
I have been asked to be
the interim head coach.

00:13.885 --> 00:15.185
Congratulations.

00:15.237 --> 00:17.820
So, if my job doesn't look like yours,

00:17.822 --> 00:19.022
then it's not legitimate?

00:19.057 --> 00:20.173
You can barely pay your rent.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.675
I'm 20 years old. I don't
need to think about my future.

00:22.727 --> 00:23.927
This would make a good musical.

00:23.979 --> 00:26.696
Why don't we work on this,
together? You could be the composer?

00:26.731 --> 00:27.780
I'm in.

00:27.832 --> 00:30.884
<i>You invited me for a booty
call, I want more than that.</i>

00:30.919 --> 00:32.534
That's called a relationship.

00:32.570 --> 00:33.803
I guess we just want different things.

00:33.838 --> 00:36.873
Are you saying that you
regret having sex with Tank,

00:36.908 --> 00:38.591
or that it was not consensual?

00:39.102 --> 00:41.240
_

00:41.396 --> 00:42.545
If we're gonna get past this,

00:42.581 --> 00:45.498
I need you to know the
truth and be okay with it.

Ha, that's funny.

02:21.963 --> 02:25.465
I will have you know I have an excellent
excuse for wasting so much time.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.718
My "Everyday Hero" project
is officially on hold.

02:28.753 --> 02:31.587
I thought you just got the
go-ahead to paint all those benches?

02:31.639 --> 02:34.657
I did, but now they need to do background
checks on everyone that I picked.

02:34.693 --> 02:36.592
Including the 79-year-old woman

02:36.644 --> 02:37.760
who volunteers as a crossing guard.

02:37.812 --> 02:40.513
Gotta make sure that she's
not some drug kingpin.

02:40.565 --> 02:41.814
Any word from Emmett?

02:41.850 --> 02:43.466
No.

02:43.501 --> 02:45.601
Every day I wake up thinking today
will be the day that he calls,

02:45.653 --> 02:46.819
and then total radio silence.

02:46.855 --> 02:48.521
It's like torture.

02:48.573 --> 02:50.473
Just give it time.
He'll come around, honey.

02:50.508 --> 02:53.409
John: Yeah. I got it, thanks.

02:53.445 --> 02:55.411
That is ridiculous!

02:55.447 --> 02:56.779
Haven't had my first cup of coffee

02:56.831 --> 02:58.498
and already I'm putting out fires.

02:58.533 --> 02:59.499
What's wrong?

02:59.534 --> 03:01.451
Another one of my assistants quit.

03:01.486 --> 03:04.587
Everyone's jumping ship to follow
Coach Walsh to his new team.

03:04.622 --> 03:06.289
I'm sorry, honey.

03:06.341 --> 03:08.341
Leaving me completely short-handed.

03:08.376 --> 03:10.710
We have this huge game
against the Badgers this week.

03:10.762 --> 03:12.678
If we win, I'm going to
ask the athletic director

03:12.714 --> 03:15.515
to call off the search for the new head
coach and give me the job full time.

03:15.550 --> 03:16.632
Wow.

03:16.684 --> 03:19.685
Where am I going to find
help with such short notice?

03:22.496 --> 03:23.529
Oh, you're kidding, right?

03:23.531 --> 03:25.747
You said Al you're doing
is playing the waiting game?

03:25.783 --> 03:27.699
Honey, this would be great!

03:27.701 --> 03:29.501
I would love you to work with me.

03:29.537 --> 03:31.670
It'll keep your mind off Emmett.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.879
All right.

03:42.934 --> 03:44.433
Really? You're in?

Royce. I know that.

I'm just gonna see you around.

04:22.423 --> 04:25.424
to get involved with someone
who lives right down the hall?

04:25.426 --> 04:27.392
Another Mingo sighting?

04:27.428 --> 04:29.811
He hooked up with some girl last night.

04:32.433 --> 04:35.400
I have a great idea to
take your mind off him.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.405
We should join a sorority!

04:40.441 --> 04:43.408
I'm not the sorority type.

04:43.444 --> 04:45.611
Well, you know, party girls

04:45.663 --> 04:48.780
whose main talent is holding each
other's hair back while they puke?

04:48.782 --> 04:51.617
I'll give you a pass on that stereotyping

04:51.669 --> 04:53.619
because you have had a bad morning.

04:55.873 --> 04:57.673
I hear it's a lot of fun.

04:57.708 --> 05:01.493
And don't you want to leave college
with a few good stories to tell?

05:04.732 --> 05:07.232
I could stand to meet a few people.

05:07.268 --> 05:08.500
Yes! (Giggling)

05:08.552 --> 05:10.352

05:10.387 --> 05:12.521
You know how I've been looking all over

05:12.573 --> 05:14.606
for a place to do my ukulele circle?

05:14.608 --> 05:16.475
Well, I finally found one.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.428
The Cracked Mug, Regina's new coffee house.

05:19.463 --> 05:21.380
It's so nice of her.

05:21.432 --> 05:23.065

07:22.603 --> 07:24.353

every night this week.

07:24.405 --> 07:25.737
Yeah, uh, except Thursday.

07:25.739 --> 07:27.539
I'm taking Lily to Vesuvius.

07:27.574 --> 07:30.308
Whoa, fancy.

07:37.217 --> 07:40.419
I love Lily, but don't you think
it's a little soon after Nikki

07:40.454 --> 07:42.404

07:42.456 --> 07:44.172
One of the problems with me and Nikki

07:44.208 --> 07:48.060
was we never had the chance to
live together before we got married.

07:48.112 --> 07:49.945

asking for your opinion.

10:02.262 --> 10:03.562
What do you mean?

10:03.597 --> 10:06.531
I was drowning. But the senior
Thetas helped me pick my schedule,

10:06.567 --> 10:08.250
they gave me advice on the best professors.

10:08.285 --> 10:12.137
Look, I'm telling you, it's worth
joining just for the test banks alone.

10:12.172 --> 10:14.272
Tests from all the previous years?

10:14.308 --> 10:15.307
Yeah.

10:15.309 --> 10:18.159
And since Thetas tend
to be over-achievers,

10:18.212 --> 10:19.377
the networking is pretty insane.

10:19.413 --> 10:23.098
Wow. I thought it was just
a bunch of dumb parties.

dumb, they're awesome.

11:35.254 --> 11:36.688
_

11:36.689 --> 11:39.090
_

11:39.126 --> 11:40.191
That's great!

11:40.193 --> 11:43.295
That's really great.

11:43.347 --> 11:46.131
<i>I got commissioned by the
city to do an art project.</i>

11:46.632 --> 11:48.310
_

11:48.311 --> 11:50.311
_

11:54.091 --> 11:55.674
Look at us.

11:55.676 --> 11:57.776
Still a power couple, right?

11:59.277 --> 12:01.160
_

12:02.261 --> 12:05.461
_

12:05.686 --> 12:06.918
<i>Oh, uh, sure.</i>

12:08.989 --> 12:10.789
Hey, I miss... you...

12:19.700 --> 12:22.701
(Sighs)

12:33.802 --> 12:35.395
That's your third bouncer, today.

12:37.202 --> 12:40.813
_

12:40.887 --> 12:42.853
Okay, no, no, no. Whatever is going on,

12:42.905 --> 12:44.939
leave it in the locker room, okay?

12:44.941 --> 12:48.075
When you're here, I need
your head in the game.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.076
You understand me?

12:51.764 --> 12:52.763
Bay, where's Bay? Bay!

12:52.815 --> 12:53.898
Get over here!

12:53.933 --> 12:54.949
You got your phone?

12:54.984 --> 12:55.950
Yeah, why?

12:55.985 --> 12:58.652
Okay, I need you to video this young man

12:58.688 --> 13:01.822
so that I can show him everything
that he's doing wrong today.

13:01.857 --> 13:03.490
Okay?

13:03.526 --> 13:05.559
I'm gonna go work with
the infielders. Good luck.

13:07.763 --> 13:09.547
Someone needs a Xanax.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.395
_

13:15.638 --> 13:16.637
You okay?

13:18.518 --> 13:21.216
_

13:21.577 --> 13:22.710
All right, what did you do?

13:23.711 --> 13:26.289
_

13:26.299 --> 13:29.617
Because you're the guy and she is
the nicest person on the planet.

13:31.418 --> 13:37.281
_

13:37.393 --> 13:40.561
Oh, apologize. Profusely and immediately.

13:41.262 --> 13:45.413
_

13:45.434 --> 13:48.252
No! No, no, no, no! This is not the end.

13:48.253 --> 13:50.353
_

13:50.439 --> 13:51.939
Do you still love her?

13:51.940 --> 13:53.240
_

13:53.326 --> 13:55.376
Then you have to keep
talking to each other.

13:55.411 --> 13:58.012
You two are meant to be together.

13:58.014 --> 14:01.115
There is no way that I am letting
you go down without a fight.

14:04.287 --> 14:06.170
Hey, Red, wait up!

14:06.205 --> 14:07.838
Whoa, hey, hey.

14:07.873 --> 14:09.823
Hey, where is the fire?

14:09.859 --> 14:12.926
I can't talk. I have way too much
studying to do before pref day.

14:12.928 --> 14:14.778
Whoa. You're rushing?

14:14.814 --> 14:15.896
Yeah. Why?

14:15.948 --> 14:17.831
Just did not strike me as the type.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.883
What do you know about it?

14:19.919 --> 14:21.335
A lot, actually.

14:21.387 --> 14:23.887
You got the tri-ups. Those girls
will drink you right under the table.

14:23.923 --> 14:26.824
(With Southern accent) Rho Kappa
Eps are your good old Southern girls.

14:26.859 --> 14:29.026
Although they are a bit
prissy for my tastes.

14:29.078 --> 14:31.929
And then... you've got the Thetas.

14:31.964 --> 14:32.930
My personal favorite.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.566
Sounds like you have a lot of experience.

14:35.618 --> 14:37.785
Um, you're mad at me

14:37.820 --> 14:39.486
about yesterday morning.

14:40.539 --> 14:41.672
Not sure what you're talking about.

14:41.707 --> 14:43.007
I just wanted to let you know

14:43.059 --> 14:44.808
that it wasn't like I was trying
to rub your face in it or anything.

14:44.844 --> 14:46.560
It was just bad timing.

14:46.595 --> 14:47.695
It's fine.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.730
You were honest with me about who you are.

14:49.732 --> 14:51.749
Hook up with whoever you want.

14:56.472 --> 14:58.639
Ugh, I'm sorry Travis got you involved.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.574
I'm not. You two are my friends,

15:00.576 --> 15:02.376
and I'm just here to help. Talk to me.

15:02.411 --> 15:03.627
I don't know.

15:03.679 --> 15:07.147
It's that whole jock culture.
It's the game. It changes them.

15:08.184 --> 15:10.117
Well, right now, it's the other way around.

15:10.152 --> 15:11.402
What do you mean?

15:11.454 --> 15:14.204
He's miserable. He can't
hit the broad side of a barn.

15:14.256 --> 15:16.423
Maybe one of those Spirit
Girls can help him out.

15:16.475 --> 15:18.308
What are Spirit Girls?

15:18.361 --> 15:21.145
Pocket-sized hotties
that go to all the games.

15:21.197 --> 15:22.196
Is that was this is about?

15:22.248 --> 15:24.248
Mary Beth, Travis would never cheat on you.

15:24.283 --> 15:25.933
If he did, I'd kill him.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.370
It's not just that. He used
to be so sweet and considerate.

15:29.405 --> 15:31.972
Now, it's like he barely knows I exist.

15:32.007 --> 15:33.323
You just hit a bump in the road.

15:33.359 --> 15:36.243
You two are good together.
You have a history.

15:36.295 --> 15:38.178
You don't just throw all of that away.

15:38.214 --> 15:40.214
Talk to him tell him how you feel.

15:40.266 --> 15:41.265
No, I'm not gonna nag him.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.984
If he wants to talk, he can come to me.

15:44.019 --> 15:47.788
(Sighs) Fine. I'll talk to him.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.833
Welcome to pref day.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.519
I'm Stephanie. I'm your rush counselor.

16:02.555 --> 16:06.523
Over the next few hours, you'll be
interviewed by the five sororities on campus.

16:06.575 --> 16:09.943
At the end, you'll rank your
top three in order of preference.

16:10.015 --> 16:12.950
If you match, you'll get a bid.

16:15.451 --> 16:19.290

16:19.291 --> 16:22.860

16:29.951 --> 16:34.546
_

16:36.187 --> 16:37.937
Ok, ladies. Let's get started.

16:46.318 --> 16:47.451
(Giggling)

16:48.452 --> 16:50.608
_

16:51.009 --> 16:55.622
_

16:57.196 --> 16:59.196
(Both laughing)

17:03.135 --> 17:05.102
Kathryn, hi!

17:05.137 --> 17:06.353
What are you doing here?

17:06.405 --> 17:08.939
I was just putting up fliers

17:08.991 --> 17:10.107
for our musical showcase.

17:10.159 --> 17:13.926
Excellent! This is Julian Stanton.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.280
He's one of our professors
in the deaf program.

17:16.315 --> 17:17.865
Pleasure to meet you.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.950
Hi, I'm Kathryn Kennish.

17:19.984 --> 17:22.953
Julian recently joined from Gallaudet.

17:23.005 --> 17:27.140
It was a tough call, but Lily is
quite the persuasive recruiter.

17:27.192 --> 17:29.076
How do you two know each other?

17:29.111 --> 17:31.962
Oh, Kathryn's my b... um...

17:31.997 --> 17:35.048
You know Daphne Vasquez in our program?

17:35.100 --> 17:36.934
Kathryn's her mum.

17:36.986 --> 17:39.570
Oh, I see the resemblance.

17:39.605 --> 17:40.737
(Nervous laughter)

17:40.739 --> 17:42.789
Thank you.

17:42.825 --> 17:44.541
Well, I have to run.

17:44.543 --> 17:45.842
I'll see you at the staff meeting, later?

17:45.878 --> 17:46.960
- Yeah, I'll see you later.
- All right.

17:47.012 --> 17:48.679
Bye.

17:51.617 --> 17:52.666
Oh, gosh!

17:52.701 --> 17:54.451
I'm late for a class visit.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.753
Shall I take some of those and put
them across the other side of campus?

17:56.755 --> 17:59.389
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.
- Cool.

17:59.425 --> 18:00.524
Okay.

18:00.526 --> 18:01.525
Bye.

18:09.301 --> 18:11.435
So, tell me why you want to be a Theta?

18:11.470 --> 18:14.288
Well, I want to be a
part of the sisterhood.

18:14.323 --> 18:17.374
You don't have to give me
the canned answer. Just relax.

18:17.409 --> 18:19.259
Right. Okay.

18:19.311 --> 18:21.078
Um...

18:21.113 --> 18:24.064
Well, Thetas put a big
emphasis on academics.

18:24.116 --> 18:26.199
That's something that's
really important to me.

18:26.251 --> 18:29.002
I got a 4.0 GPA all through high school.

18:29.054 --> 18:30.971
I'm doing my best to continue the trend.

18:31.023 --> 18:33.056
Well, we don't like to focus
on ourselves all the time.

18:33.108 --> 18:37.327
I worked at a free clinic
in East Riverside last year.

18:37.363 --> 18:39.963
That's really why I decided to go pre-med.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.214
To help those less fortunate.

18:41.266 --> 18:43.266
Oh.

18:46.271 --> 18:50.707
Uh, here's a fascinating thing about me,

18:50.743 --> 18:53.677
I was switched with another
baby at the hospital.

18:53.679 --> 18:55.012
I was raised by the wrong set of parents.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.097
We didn't find out till I was 15.

18:57.149 --> 18:58.715
Wow.

18:58.751 --> 19:02.836
And, it turns out that my
biological father is John Kennish.

19:03.939 --> 19:06.556
He played for the Royals.

19:06.558 --> 19:08.558
Kind of a celebrity. Crazy, right?

19:08.594 --> 19:10.861
I don't really follow sports.

19:10.913 --> 19:12.829
Oh, he's also a state senator.

19:12.881 --> 19:17.517
And my mom is Kathryn
Kennish, the novelist.

19:17.569 --> 19:19.653
She wrote a book about
us. It was a bestseller.

19:19.688 --> 19:20.871
Cool.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.675
I think you should meet
some of the other Thetas.

19:24.710 --> 19:25.809
Oh, that'd be great!

19:25.844 --> 19:28.528
Here's our rush chair now.

19:28.564 --> 19:29.613
Daphne, this is Royce.

19:29.648 --> 19:31.748
Hi, nice to meet you.

19:31.784 --> 19:33.550
Hi.

19:40.453 --> 19:42.050
You look so familiar to me.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.704
Do we have a class together?

19:43.756 --> 19:45.473
I don't think so.

19:45.508 --> 19:46.674
Hmm. What's your major?

19:46.676 --> 19:47.642
Pre-med.

19:47.694 --> 19:49.644
Ah, I'm Russian lit. Hmm.

19:49.696 --> 19:52.330
What dorm do you live in?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.715
Hanes.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.352
I saw you yesterday morning.

19:58.388 --> 20:01.188
Oh, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.357
That guy Mingo hooks up with everyone.

20:03.359 --> 20:04.458
Oh...

20:04.494 --> 20:07.194
No, no! I mean, even me.

20:08.481 --> 20:10.314
Well, just that one time.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.066
We're not together or anything.

20:12.101 --> 20:13.417
He doesn't want a relationship, so...

20:15.471 --> 20:16.504
I'm gonna stop talking now.

20:16.571 --> 20:19.488
Oh, it's fine, really.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.374
So, you're pre-med?

20:29.375 --> 20:31.000
_

20:31.001 --> 20:34.372
Hi. I'm looking for lily Summers.

20:35.173 --> 20:38.379
_

20:39.994 --> 20:42.194
No. It's okay. Thank you.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.049
Oh, hi, Kathryn, you're still here?

20:47.101 --> 20:49.018
Yeah.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.771
I was just gonna put some
more musical fliers up here,

20:51.823 --> 20:54.840
but, um, I... I gotta go home.

20:54.876 --> 20:56.842
Kathryn.

20:56.844 --> 20:58.644
You get close to people you work with,

20:58.679 --> 21:01.580
but I promise there's nothing
going on between Julian and I.

21:01.616 --> 21:03.582
It's really... it's none of my business.

21:03.584 --> 21:05.801
No, I'm glad you came back
so we could talk about it.

21:05.837 --> 21:07.720
But, I promise, you have
nothing to worry about.

21:07.772 --> 21:11.607
Well, it's just that you
introduced me as Daphne's mom,

21:11.659 --> 21:12.725
not Toby's.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.726
I did?

21:16.564 --> 21:17.630
I did.

21:17.632 --> 21:22.735
Look, does Julian know
you have a boyfriend?

21:22.737 --> 21:24.670
Honey, I am not judging.

21:24.705 --> 21:27.540
It's just that I know
how Toby feels about you,

21:27.592 --> 21:30.693
and I don't want to see him
get his heart broken again.

21:30.728 --> 21:32.411
Yeah.

21:38.436 --> 21:43.272
Okay. I want all of you here two
hours before the game, tomorrow.

21:43.324 --> 21:44.457
(Groaning)

21:44.492 --> 21:48.194
I was not asking for any opinions, okay?

21:48.229 --> 21:51.097
Everybody needs a really good warmup.

21:51.149 --> 21:55.201
3:00, no exceptions. That's it.

21:55.236 --> 21:56.285
Bay, it's all yours.

21:56.337 --> 21:58.087
All right. Well, now

21:58.122 --> 22:01.974
if you would all just stack
your equipment right over here

22:02.009 --> 22:03.943
in some nice, neat piles.

22:03.978 --> 22:06.112
That... would be amazing.

22:06.147 --> 22:09.031
Or, you could do that. That works too.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.883
Thank you. Thank you.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.131
_

22:17.792 --> 22:19.024
Yeah.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.505
_

22:22.506 --> 22:24.647
No, of course not.

22:24.682 --> 22:27.016
But, think about it from her side.

22:27.068 --> 22:29.902
You're on this whole
new journey without her.

22:29.903 --> 22:32.803
_

22:32.907 --> 22:34.874
You have to show her that she is still

22:34.926 --> 22:38.010
the most important thing in your life.

22:40.031 --> 22:42.698
Stephanie: Okay, it's time to
write down your preferences.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.501
Remember, the more sororities you list,

22:45.536 --> 22:47.586
the better your chances of getting a bid.

22:50.725 --> 22:52.324
So, how did it go with Lambda?

22:53.461 --> 22:54.660
I think it went well.

22:54.712 --> 22:56.295
I liked all the girls,

22:56.347 --> 22:58.347
and they seemed to like me.

22:58.399 --> 23:01.484
So, you're gonna put them down first?

23:01.519 --> 23:05.504
Actually, I'm thinking
about doing a suicide bid.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.207
Suicide?

23:08.209 --> 23:10.226
Just them. No one else.

23:10.261 --> 23:12.278
Are you sure?

23:12.313 --> 23:15.447
Lambda is where I feel like I belong.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.218
It's them or nobody for me.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.289
Hey, I got your text. What's up?

23:43.290 --> 23:46.326
_

23:46.327 --> 23:48.148
_

23:48.749 --> 23:49.865
Can't you reschedule?

23:50.266 --> 23:53.917
_

23:54.021 --> 23:56.021
First of all, I suck at pitching.

23:56.057 --> 23:59.792
It's one of the reasons
I'm a DP and not a director.

23:59.827 --> 24:03.929
Second, my ASL is nowhere near good enough.

24:03.930 --> 24:06.054
_

24:06.055 --> 24:08.183
_

24:16.984 --> 24:19.953
Hey, Tim! Uh, have you seen Travis?

24:19.956 --> 24:23.332
Yeah, I saw him get into a car
out front. Just a few minutes ago.

24:23.384 --> 24:24.333
Huh.

24:25.334 --> 24:29.120
_

24:30.121 --> 24:33.440
_

24:33.461 --> 24:35.294
Okay, it's 3:00, everyone checked in?

24:35.346 --> 24:36.762
I don't see Travis.

24:36.797 --> 24:40.399
He was heading to the locker room to
go get an ice pack for his shoulder.

24:40.434 --> 24:42.167
I hope you mean a heat pack.

24:42.203 --> 24:42.955
Yeah, that one.

24:42.964 --> 24:46.318
Okay, when you see him, tell him I
want him to do 12 pitches at 50 feet,

24:46.340 --> 24:47.406
and then 16 at 60.

24:47.441 --> 24:50.109
I will definitely tell him that.

24:53.247 --> 24:54.280
Here you go.

24:54.282 --> 24:57.099
Iris Watkins?

25:00.938 --> 25:02.237
I'm gonna wait for you.

25:02.273 --> 25:04.156
Stop torturing yourself! Go ahead.

25:04.158 --> 25:05.124
(Sighs)

25:07.128 --> 25:08.127
(Gasps and giggles)

25:08.129 --> 25:10.179
I'm in! I'm gonna be a Lambda!

25:10.214 --> 25:12.831
Yay! Oh!

25:12.867 --> 25:15.751
- (Both laughing)
- Oh, congratulations!

25:15.786 --> 25:17.036
Yes, yes, yes.

25:17.038 --> 25:19.138
That's all of them.

25:19.173 --> 25:21.940
Oh, but Daphne didn't get an envelope?

25:23.678 --> 25:24.843
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:24.879 --> 25:28.614
If there's no envelope, it
means you didn't get a bid.

25:33.638 --> 25:34.687
I don't understand.

25:34.722 --> 25:38.757
I made a single bid for Theta.

25:40.928 --> 25:42.494
I guess they didn't want me.

25:42.530 --> 25:44.563
Well, then they're idiots.

25:44.598 --> 25:45.681
It's fine.

25:45.733 --> 25:48.567
I wasn't really that into it anyway.

25:55.968 --> 25:57.130
Ok, here we go.

25:57.142 --> 26:00.844
One, two, a-one-two-three-four.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.980
(All playing ukulele)

26:05.751 --> 26:06.967
For you.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.545
And that's when our hero realizes...

26:38.384 --> 26:39.633
that he's broken the sound barrier...

26:42.488 --> 26:44.254
Forever.

26:45.524 --> 26:46.873
Really?

26:46.926 --> 26:51.094
So, it's the whole post-apocalyptic,
dystopian Fritz Lang, thing?

27:00.306 --> 27:02.139
But it's silent. You got that, right?

27:02.174 --> 27:03.640
Epstein: Yeah, I got that.

27:03.659 --> 27:08.979
It's just that everyone wants to do silent
since <i>The Artist</i> won the Oscar.

27:15.187 --> 27:16.186
So, it's a no?

27:17.323 --> 27:19.072
Emmett,

27:19.124 --> 27:22.259
you're pitching me what
you think I want to hear.

27:24.830 --> 27:27.798
Next time, tell me a story
that you want to watch.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.032
Something personal.

27:33.806 --> 27:35.105
Uh, Professor?

27:37.943 --> 27:39.793
A love story.

27:45.818 --> 27:49.820
About a deaf boy who falls in
love for the very first time...

27:51.707 --> 27:52.789
with a hearing girl.

27:53.809 --> 27:54.791
Epstein: That's interesting.

27:54.827 --> 27:57.561
It certainly hasn't been done to death.

28:00.616 --> 28:01.615
Keep talking.

28:05.471 --> 28:07.371
Thank you. Yeah, I'll see you guys around.

28:07.406 --> 28:08.322
Okay.

28:08.357 --> 28:11.408
Thank you for coming.

28:13.212 --> 28:16.213
I wanna introduce you to everyone if you...

28:17.014 --> 28:20.400
_

28:20.402 --> 28:22.202
Oh, right. Well, let me drive you.

28:22.237 --> 28:23.537
I wanna be there to
watch you pitch, anyway.

28:23.538 --> 28:25.566
_

28:25.967 --> 28:29.387
_

28:29.399 --> 28:31.311
Oh, well, you got a ride?

28:32.512 --> 28:35.528
_

28:35.529 --> 28:37.630
_

28:37.636 --> 28:40.303
Anna drove you all the way over here

28:40.339 --> 28:41.338
just to wait in the car?

28:41.339 --> 28:42.939
_

28:43.275 --> 28:44.858
Why would she do that?

28:44.859 --> 28:49.359
_

28:49.381 --> 28:54.050
A fan? Can't you see
how ridiculous that is?

28:54.051 --> 28:59.583
_

28:59.584 --> 29:02.679
_

29:02.680 --> 29:05.053
_

29:05.054 --> 29:08.254
No, you're right. It shouldn't,

29:08.901 --> 29:09.933
but it does.

29:13.772 --> 29:15.822
I can't do this anymore.

29:16.023 --> 29:18.633
_

29:19.745 --> 29:23.680
I've worked really hard
to be the kind of person

29:23.732 --> 29:27.768
who's not needy and insecure,

29:27.820 --> 29:31.705
but this relationship is turning
me into someone I don't want to be.

29:31.706 --> 29:36.265
_

29:36.278 --> 29:38.562
You're a freshman in college.

29:38.597 --> 29:41.731
You should be able to hang
out with whoever you want.

29:43.569 --> 29:45.902
Date whoever you want.

29:45.903 --> 29:49.644
_

29:51.643 --> 29:58.448
You're the first person
I ever fell in love with.

29:58.450 --> 30:02.536
The first person I ever
thought about a future with.

30:04.723 --> 30:08.442
I lost my virginity to you.

30:08.477 --> 30:13.413
I learned a new language for you.

30:13.465 --> 30:15.499
I will always love you.

30:17.586 --> 30:22.506
But this relationship
isn't right for me anymore.

30:25.611 --> 30:30.280
Please, don't make it harder
than it is for me to do this.

30:44.614 --> 30:46.518
All right, all right, let's go!

30:46.615 --> 30:48.381
Oh, hey. Athletic director just got here.

30:48.433 --> 30:50.100
Is my star pitcher all warmed up?

30:50.192 --> 30:51.241
Uh, not exactly.

30:51.276 --> 30:52.359
Where is he?

30:52.361 --> 30:55.128
Okay, don't freak out.

30:55.413 --> 30:56.629
Um, I was covering for him.

30:56.665 --> 30:58.681
- What?
- I'm sorry,

30:58.717 --> 31:01.200
but he had something really
important to do for Mary Beth.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.953
He's blowing off a ball
game for his girlfriend?

31:03.955 --> 31:05.037
What the hell is he thinking?

31:05.073 --> 31:07.840
You can't blame it all on Travis.

31:07.876 --> 31:10.009
He was following my advice.

31:10.011 --> 31:12.562
I didn't know that he would miss the game.

31:12.614 --> 31:15.665
Bay, you're the one who is
supposed to be on my side here.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.668
Do you have any idea how
important this game is to me?

31:18.720 --> 31:19.886
Maybe too important?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.470
What did you just say?

31:21.506 --> 31:23.773
Travis is going through a
really hard time, right now,

31:23.808 --> 31:24.891
but you don't care about that.

31:24.893 --> 31:27.393
If it's not about baseball,
it doesn't matter to you.

31:27.394 --> 31:29.919
_

31:37.520 --> 31:39.945
You're not pitching. You are benched.

31:40.408 --> 31:43.392
- Dad, please!
- Those are the rules.

31:48.383 --> 31:51.217
Please tell me that it
went well with Mary Beth?

32:00.245 --> 32:02.161
Uh, can I talk to you?

32:02.196 --> 32:03.329
Sure. What's up?

32:03.364 --> 32:05.181
I didn't get a bid from Theta.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.350
I know. It was a
competitive year, I'm sorry.

32:07.385 --> 32:09.302
I think we both know why I didn't get in.

32:09.354 --> 32:10.469
We do?

32:10.521 --> 32:13.272
We hooked up with the same
guy and you blackballed me.

32:13.308 --> 32:16.042
Look, I'm not allowed to discuss
the decision-making process.

32:16.077 --> 32:17.243
Ugh, okay, fine.

32:17.295 --> 32:19.078
I'm not even sure why I care,

32:19.080 --> 32:22.415
since it's catty, and shallow, and
pretty much exactly what I expected

32:22.417 --> 32:26.435
from someone in a sorority before
I started this whole stupid process.

32:26.487 --> 32:29.021
The reason you didn't get a bid
had nothing to do with Mingo.

32:29.023 --> 32:30.239
In fact, I voted for you.

32:30.275 --> 32:32.275
Tara is the one who blackballed you.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.993
Tara?

32:33.995 --> 32:35.161
The girl you interviewed with.

32:35.213 --> 32:37.296
She said you were trying
way too hard to impress her.

32:38.850 --> 32:40.149
I'm sorry you didn't get in.

32:40.184 --> 32:42.018
And, I'm even more sorry
I hooked up with a guy

32:42.070 --> 32:43.269
that you are clearly obsessed with.

32:43.271 --> 32:47.039
But, if you're looking for
a catty and superficial girl,

32:47.075 --> 32:48.874
I think you should try
looking in the mirror.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.715
- Do you want anything else?
- No, no, I'm good.

33:03.996 --> 33:06.881
Toby, this dinner was perfect, thank you.

33:10.753 --> 33:12.052
Okay then.

33:18.778 --> 33:19.860
Toby, if this is...

33:19.912 --> 33:21.712
No! No, it's not a ring.

33:21.747 --> 33:23.998
(Laughing nervously)

33:24.000 --> 33:25.900
With my history, that's totally fair.

33:25.935 --> 33:26.884
(Chuckles)

33:26.936 --> 33:29.853
No, uh, please, just open it.

33:29.889 --> 33:32.606
Okay.

33:36.662 --> 33:37.828
I want you to move in with me.

33:41.550 --> 33:44.351
I want to wake up next
to you every morning.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.687
I want to go to sleep with you every night.

33:46.722 --> 33:48.622
I want you to be 10 feet
away when I'm flossing.

33:48.658 --> 33:49.623
All of it.

33:52.511 --> 33:54.712
That's so lovely. Thank you.

33:56.649 --> 33:59.316
We can start moving your things in tonight.

33:59.368 --> 34:01.368
Toby...

34:04.540 --> 34:06.440
I have feelings for someone else.

34:09.277 --> 34:10.277
What?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.228
I didn't mean for it to happen,

34:12.281 --> 34:13.614
and nothing has happened.

34:13.649 --> 34:16.116
It's just feelings.

34:16.118 --> 34:18.552
And that doesn't mean that I
don't still have them for you.

34:23.559 --> 34:25.159
Who is it?

34:25.194 --> 34:26.393
He's a colleague.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.164
We've spent a lot of time together.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.431
At work, I mean.

34:33.252 --> 34:34.251
I'm sorry.

34:34.303 --> 34:38.138
I really don't want us to break up.

34:38.139 --> 34:40.139
I'm just confused.

34:42.143 --> 34:44.277
Me too.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.917
Daphne: You should have
seen me in that interview.

34:49.969 --> 34:53.219
I was overselling myself like
I was in some bad infomercial.

34:53.222 --> 34:54.288
Aww, honey.

34:54.322 --> 34:56.857
And then, when I found out
that I didn't get a bid,

34:56.909 --> 34:58.942
I got in this girl's face.

34:58.995 --> 35:01.762
I swear, two more minutes and I
would have been pulling out her hair.

35:01.797 --> 35:03.130
I'm trying not to laugh.

35:03.165 --> 35:05.766
don't! It's mortifying!

35:05.801 --> 35:08.819
I didn't even know you were rushing.

35:08.854 --> 35:10.904
I don't know. I wasn't planning on it,

35:10.940 --> 35:12.690
but then you go through the process

35:12.742 --> 35:14.742
and you see everyone in their groups,

35:14.777 --> 35:16.010
and they all look so happy.

35:16.045 --> 35:18.879
And they have each other,
and then you start to think,

35:18.881 --> 35:20.014
I need to do this.

35:20.049 --> 35:22.883
I need a group of overnight best friends.

35:22.885 --> 35:24.918
That's completely human.

35:24.954 --> 35:26.754
I never thought I'd be the kind of girl

35:26.789 --> 35:29.990
who got caught up in some
outsider label of who's cool.

35:30.042 --> 35:33.877
And yet, I'm sitting here
feeling like a total loser

35:33.929 --> 35:36.497
because the Thetas didn't want me.

35:36.532 --> 35:40.534
Sweetie, it doesn't make you pathetic
that you want to find your people.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.703
I just don't think they're Thetas.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.872
Yeah, well, that's good

35:44.874 --> 35:46.840
because the Thetas don't
think I'm their people, either.

35:46.876 --> 35:47.841
(Chuckling)

35:47.843 --> 35:50.544
You'll find them.

35:50.579 --> 35:52.396
Hmm?

35:54.483 --> 35:55.532
(Mugs clink)

35:58.504 --> 36:00.454
(Playing ukulele)

36:00.456 --> 36:01.455
(Knock at the door)

36:01.507 --> 36:02.473
Hey.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.358
Hey. Come on in.

36:06.595 --> 36:08.395
I can play almost anything,

36:08.397 --> 36:09.696
as long as it's in C.

36:09.698 --> 36:11.365
You got any requests?

36:11.367 --> 36:13.500
Yeah. I want you to give
Travis another chance.

36:13.552 --> 36:16.170
- Bay, please.
- Just listen.

36:16.172 --> 36:19.523
I know that you think that he
is way too caught up in baseball,

36:19.575 --> 36:21.175
but he was late to the game,

36:21.210 --> 36:22.342
and my dad benched him.

36:22.378 --> 36:24.578
And our backup pitcher
was a total disaster.

36:24.613 --> 36:27.464
And we ended up losing the biggest
game of the year by seven runs.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.550
And Travis is <i>persona non
grata</i> with the whole team.

36:29.585 --> 36:31.468
I didn't want that.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.437
I know. And...

36:35.107 --> 36:37.191
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

36:37.226 --> 36:39.393
I just want you to see what
a priority you are to him.

36:39.428 --> 36:41.328
Sometimes, things just don't work out.

36:41.363 --> 36:44.164
I don't accept that.

36:44.200 --> 36:48.068
Well, I think you're gonna have
to, 'cause it's really over.

36:49.472 --> 36:50.971
I'm sorry.

36:51.006 --> 36:52.306
Thanks.

36:54.310 --> 36:56.143
And just 'cause it's over for us,

36:56.195 --> 36:58.011
doesn't mean it's over for you and Emmett.

36:59.031 --> 37:00.013
What are you talking about?

37:01.183 --> 37:02.950
You're a good friend,

37:02.985 --> 37:05.119
and I know you care about me and Travis,

37:05.171 --> 37:07.121
but come on,

37:07.156 --> 37:09.923
that's the relationship
you should be fighting for.

37:13.145 --> 37:15.896
(Sighs)

37:18.461 --> 37:21.295
(Playing the piano)

37:21.297 --> 37:23.564
Hey. What are you doing here?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.233
I thought you were out with Lily?

37:25.268 --> 37:26.651
Oh, we finished early.

37:28.321 --> 37:29.504
Huh. How was dinner?

37:29.539 --> 37:31.372
It was fine.

37:31.407 --> 37:34.408
Um, whole moving in thing
is not gonna happen, though.

37:36.179 --> 37:37.495
Oh.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.579
You were right.

37:38.581 --> 37:42.250
I decided it's just too soon.

37:43.419 --> 37:44.519
Is there anything I can do to help?

37:44.554 --> 37:47.522
I was thinking maybe we
could get some work done.

37:49.325 --> 37:50.324
Sure.

38:01.504 --> 38:03.387
You look beautiful.

38:03.423 --> 38:05.339
I'm on my way to bid night.

38:05.391 --> 38:07.024
I feel so bad.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.310
I wish you were going to your own.

38:09.362 --> 38:11.362
Go have a great time,

38:11.397 --> 38:14.482
then come back and tell me
all their dirty little secrets.

38:14.484 --> 38:17.118
Wow. Wow. Wow.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.020
You are smoking.

38:19.055 --> 38:20.421
Do you go here? I'm Mingo, by the way.

38:20.456 --> 38:22.089
Very funny.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.179
So, uh, where's the fancy dress?

38:28.231 --> 38:30.982
I thought tonight was
the big signing ceremony?

38:31.034 --> 38:33.951
Oh, um, I decided not to join a sorority.

38:35.405 --> 38:39.874
Um, you know, actually...

38:39.926 --> 38:41.208
the truth is I didn't get a bid.

38:41.210 --> 38:44.045
Oh. Well, that's their loss

38:44.047 --> 38:45.046
and my gain.

38:45.098 --> 38:46.063
Why is that?

38:46.099 --> 38:48.182
Sorority pledges have, like, no free time.

38:48.184 --> 38:50.101
I wouldn't see you for the next two months.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.236
Who says you're gonna see me?

38:52.272 --> 38:55.990
What are you doing, tonight? You
wanna come up to my room, and like...

38:55.992 --> 38:58.159
Play darts?

38:58.161 --> 38:59.243
Uh...

38:59.295 --> 39:01.162
You know what, actually,

39:01.214 --> 39:03.798
not tonight. I'm busy.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.968
I'm hanging with my tribe.
