WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:06.705
Okay, people, shift is starting
in five minutes.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.509
Enjoy your night off,
Dr. Cummings.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.077
Keep your phone close by.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.696
Will do.

00:13.697 --> 00:15.314
Guess you and Scott
still aren't talking?

00:15.315 --> 00:16.932
Yeah, he's made it
abundantly clear

00:16.933 --> 00:18.550
that he did not appreciate my
opinion of he and Annie dating.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.319
You just said
what everybody else is thinking.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.321
That's what friends do.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.322
It's more complicated.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.090
Complicated?
It's freudian.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.526
A hot, successful surgeon who
can have his choice of women,

00:27.528 --> 00:29.361
yet he picks
the ex-addict sister-in-law

00:29.363 --> 00:31.063
of a guy
who he doesn't really like

00:31.065 --> 00:32.564
and who
his last girlfriend hates.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.665
I don't hate her.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.067
You ain't friends.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.036
I'm just saying,
it's no coincidence...

00:37.038 --> 00:39.539
On <i> both</i> their parts.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.041
Okay, are you done with this
little psychoanalysis of yours?

00:42.043 --> 00:44.243
I've said my piece.
Okay.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.645
Hey, uh, what was that
top-secret nurses' meeting today?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.080
I don't know.
I skipped it.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.615
I think it was just some,
uh, union stuff,

00:49.617 --> 00:51.183
bunch of contract negotiations
or something like that.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.151
Okay.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.585
So, you, uh, you off tonight?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.504
Well, I'm just on call,

00:55.505 --> 00:57.422
so I'm actually sneaking out
for a dinner date.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.458
Dinner date?
That's nice.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.759
Is it in 1965?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.227
Wait a minute.
On the first date?

01:02.228 --> 01:03.694
Dude, no. No, d-don't
get stuck into dinner.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.330
Dude, the crazy comes out
over dinner.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.467
Look, I actually like to
show a woman a good time, okay?

01:08.469 --> 01:11.670
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go change.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.455
31-year-old male.

01:13.456 --> 01:15.239
Pain in the lower-right quadrant
since this morning.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.275
Hi.
I'm Dr. Alexander.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.709
I'm Dylan.
Ever heard of F.O.P.?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.278
Uh, yeah.
The connective-tissue disorder?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
That's me.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.467
Okay.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.652
All right, let's <i> carefully</i>
move him to trauma 2.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.253
Any injury, even from a bump,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.788
can cause
spontaneous bone growth.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.490
Am I right, Dylan?
You got it.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.767
Hey, Jocelyn, could you get
us more pillows, please?

01:32.791 --> 01:33.791
Sure.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.728
Duty calls.
Ohh!

01:36.730 --> 01:38.397
All right, I'll see you
in the morning.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.199
Don't keep me waiting.
I won't.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.236
Good to see you back in action,
Topher. How's your head feeling?

01:44.238 --> 01:46.288
All good.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.339
Counting the days
till that Hawaiian conference.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.110
Janet! Ma!

01:51.112 --> 01:52.211
What happened?

01:52.213 --> 01:53.412
I don't know.
She's acting weird.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.847
I thought you could
take a look at her.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.832
Ma, how are you feeling?

01:56.833 --> 01:58.816
I was just telling your father
I'm perfectly capable

01:58.819 --> 02:00.819
of crossing the street
without him.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.754
Ma, dad's been dead for years.

02:02.756 --> 02:03.755
What's going on?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.691
I'm fine, christophe...

02:05.693 --> 02:06.592
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.426
Whoa.
Okay, we got you.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.794
Let's get her into trauma 1.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.230
Okay.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.831
Yo, tee.
Yeah?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.566
Nasty accident
out on highway 281.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.834
They need a doc
to move the patient.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.336
Chopper's waiting.
You want it or...?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.021
Drew, will you take it?
I got to...

02:19.022 --> 02:20.705
Yeah, stick with mama Topher.
Okay, yeah, I'm on it.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.242
Uh, Shannon, you're with me.
Let's go.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.244
All right, man, catch you later.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.245
Yo, Paul. I'm sorry, man.
Mva coming in. Back to scrubs.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.614
Fantastic.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.351
She was a little out of it
but fine.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.853
And then, on the way home, this.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.688
B.P.'s 86 over 40.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.140
Well, what does that mean?

02:38.141 --> 02:39.591
It's a little low.
It's really low.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.161
Could be heart failure, sepsis,
adrenal insufficiency.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.262
O-or just dehydration.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.463
We're gonna run
a panel of tests,

02:44.465 --> 02:45.864
and then we'll get it
all sorted out.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.633
B.P.'s down to 64.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.767
She's crashing.
Hang another liter!

02:48.769 --> 02:49.835
Central line.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.904
She needs pressors now.
Ma? Ma?!

02:51.906 --> 02:55.274
Ma?
Ma, can you hear me?

02:55.276 --> 02:56.708
Can you hear me? Ma?

02:58.746 --> 02:59.745
What do we got?

02:59.747 --> 03:01.981
Rollover mva.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.216
Driver saw a deer, swerved,
flipped the car into the ravine.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.617
How many victims?
Two.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.852
Driver's
a 38-year-old female

03:06.854 --> 03:08.887
with blunt abdominal trauma
and laceration.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.056
Still trapped in the car.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.192
Her daughter's
out, but she's got

03:12.216 --> 03:13.224
a wrist injury. Name's Brianna.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.828
Please, if you just let me
go, I can get her! Please!

03:14.852 --> 03:15.627
Hey, Brianna. Brianna!

03:15.629 --> 03:17.229
I'm Dr. Alister.
This is Dr. Rivera.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.514
How are you doing?

03:18.515 --> 03:19.798
- My wrist hurts, but she's still in there!
- Okay. Hey.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.966
Please, you have to go get her!

03:20.968 --> 03:22.368
Okay, listen to me.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.769
I'm gonna check on your mom
right away.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.771
She's not my mom.
She's my foster mom.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.272
Please don't let her die.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.907
I'm gonna do
everything I can, okay?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.976
- No! Please!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Brianna!

03:30.978 --> 03:33.412
Shannon, let's keep her warm
and get her checked out.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.680
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.382
Let's... let's take a look
at your wrist, okay?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.653
It hurts?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.793
Somebody help me!

03:47.795 --> 03:49.228
Avery?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.729
Help me!
I'm Dr. Alister.

03:52.248 --> 03:54.208
We're gonna get you out of here
as soon as we can.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.402
Stay calm.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.371
Okay. Slow your breathing. Okay.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.539
This is Dr. Rivera.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.441
Where's Brianna?!
I checked her, ma'am.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.576
I'm gonna go right back
to be with her.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.915
All right, Avery?
Uh-huh?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.684
Okay, I've got to stop
this bleeding.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.127
Okay.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.912
Okay, so you're gonna
feel a little pressure.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.988
Okay, just keep breathing deep.
You're doing great.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.724
Got it. Good.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.692
Okay, here.
Let's pack around it.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.462
Okay, now,
we stopped the bleeding,

04:23.464 --> 04:25.330
but we got to cut you
out of here, okay?

04:25.332 --> 04:26.265
Okay.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.799
We're gonna be right here.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.734
Okay.
Okay.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.569
You're doing great.
Okay.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.837
Let's go!

04:31.839 --> 04:34.373
All right,
I'll go stay with Brianna.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.549
Brianna, it's gonna be okay.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.305 --> 05:05.570
Christopher.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.441
Ma, you're okay.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.642
You just passed out for a bit.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.077
B.P.'s only up to 87.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.779
She's barely responding
to pressors.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.813
What are we forgetting?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.847
Any recent fevers?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.382
No.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.916
What do you think?
Brain-stem stroke?

05:18.919 --> 05:19.918
A stroke? Really?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.453
I-it's unlikely, Toph.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.587
She's altered, but...

05:22.589 --> 05:24.523
I'm gonna clear
the C.T. queue.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.326
Ma, we're gonna take you to have
your brain scanned, okay?

05:27.328 --> 05:30.329
I'm so tired.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.098
Mm.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.469
- All right, Mollie. You on it?
- Yeah.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.970
Do you really think
it's a stroke?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.506
It could be, but we're just
not gonna take any chances.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.342
We're gonna run every test,
all right?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.443
So we're not panicking?

05:44.445 --> 05:45.777
No, we're not.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.713
I'll let you know
if we get there.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.715
Thanks, T.C.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.484
He's... he's not ready
to lose her.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.786
You never <i> are.</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:05.130
Okay.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.631
Your pain could be
from appendicitis,

06:06.633 --> 06:08.600
so I've called
for a surgical consult.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.502
What about, uh, kidney stones?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.037
I get them all the time
from the F.O.P.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.405
I'm gonna check for that, too,

06:13.406 --> 06:14.772
but we really don't want
to miss an appy.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.909
Um, actually, can we
place a pulse ox instead?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.678
- Okay.
- Even pressure from a B.P. cuff

06:19.680 --> 06:20.846
can cause bone growth.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.585
Scott.
This is Dylan.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.653
He has F.O.P.,
which causes spontaneous...

06:28.655 --> 06:30.055
I'm familiar with F.O.P.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.658
- Hey, Dylan. I'm Dr. Clemmens.
- Hey.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.129
Dylan presents with a few hours
of lower-right-quadrant pain.

06:37.131 --> 06:39.698
So I wanted a consult
for appendicitis.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.732
Okay.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.934
All right, Dylan.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.537
Does this hurt here?

06:45.539 --> 06:48.840
More like here
and all the way to my back.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.809
What do you think?
C.T.?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.145
I think you should have
checked an ultrasound

06:53.147 --> 06:54.546
and called a urologist.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.415
It sounds
more like kidney stones.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.550
Looks like you called it, Dylan.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.686
He's spiking a fever...
102.5.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.821
Okay, if it <i> is</i> kidney stones,
they could be infected,

07:02.823 --> 07:06.091
so let's get a u.A.
And send off a urine culture.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.025
Yes, doctor.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.762
If it <i> is</i> the kidney stones
that are causing his fever...

07:10.764 --> 07:12.864
Yeah, I know...
Surgery.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.634
And with F.O.P.,
that could kill him.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.769
Thank you, Dr. Clemmens.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.977
Okay, these sutures should hold
till we get to the hospital.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.512
Brianna's inhalers.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.046
Did you get them?
They were in the car.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.949
We'll radio the ambulance
and have them check.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.851
Tell them that she needs them.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.553
She has cystic fibrosis.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.054
Okay, I'll let them know.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.090
She seems like a good kid.
Pretty cool under pressure.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.793
That's her.
She's the best.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.696
She's so smart, I can
hardly keep up with her.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.031
How long has she
been living with you?

07:46.033 --> 07:48.267
Six months.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.502
But I knew within a week
that I was gonna adopt her.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.037
We connected
right from the start.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.738
Okay, the ambulance
has the inhalers.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.973
I'll check on her personally

07:54.975 --> 07:56.541
as soon as
we get to the hospital.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.010
Thank god she's okay.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.147
Listen.
Promise me.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.517
Promise me that you are
gonna take care of her.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.019
She acts tough,
but she's just a kid.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.788
I'll do everything I can.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.862
I feel like I'm floating.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.164
Glad to see
the pain meds are kicking in.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.766
Best part of being here.
Hospitals have the good stuff.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.602
You spend a lot of time
in hospitals?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.504
Yeah, since I was 13.

08:25.506 --> 08:29.241
At first, the doctors
thought I had a tumor.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.510
They went in, operated.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.779
Actually caused the tissue
around the site

08:34.780 --> 08:36.214
to lock into bone.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.782
Then, when I was a teenager,

08:37.784 --> 08:39.818
I messed up my shoulder
pretty good.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.919
Yeah? What happened?

08:40.921 --> 08:43.054
I was an idiot.
I tried skateboarding.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.790
Guess I was tired of hearing
I was an inspiration

08:45.792 --> 08:48.994
just for putting my pants on
in the morning.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.162
Didn't want to be
the disability mascot anymore.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.598
So that's a "no" to the, uh,
inspirational speech

08:53.600 --> 08:54.666
in the children's ward?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.034
Mm, hard pass.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.569
Just making sure.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.804
Okay, thank you.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.038
Leave it on the table
just in case.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.207
Guys,
this is Dr. park.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.809
I've asked him in
for a urology consult.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.077
Oh, great!

09:06.079 --> 09:08.113
I'm just going to take a look.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.949
Fascinating.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.118
I've never seen this
in real life.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.856
The stone's causing moderate
to severe hydronephrosis.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.192
With the infection,
he needs surgery right away.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.160
No.
Excuse me?

09:22.162 --> 09:23.495
I'm not doing surgery.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.829
Been there, done that.
I'm not into it.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.798
Okay, I think
what Dylan is trying to say

09:26.800 --> 09:29.601
is that he would like to avoid
the risk of anesthesia.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.703
Not to mention the potential
permanent calcification

09:31.705 --> 09:33.160
of his urinary tract.

09:33.161 --> 09:34.616
Yeah, I for sure
don't want that.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.072
None of that matters
if he gets septic and dies.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.076
Endoscopic surgery
will minimize bone growth.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.245
Okay, there has to be
other options besides surgery.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.680
I mean,
can we at least consider...

09:41.682 --> 09:43.515
You wanted my opinion.
You have it.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.349
Surgery now, unless you want
to risk sepsis and death.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.085
I'm not sure
we're quite there yet.

09:47.087 --> 09:51.122
What about...
Lithotripsy with antibiotics?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.291
We use the sound waves
to break up the kidney stone,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.293
and maybe those smaller pieces
pass on their own.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.062
That sounds good to me.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.830
We're wasting time.
His infection's only getting worse.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.332
I'm gonna let the O.R. know
that we're coming.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.367
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.769
Okay. Dr. park,
can I speak with you outside?

10:12.879 --> 10:15.046
Okay, he wants lithotripsy.
Why can't we at least try it?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.715
You want me to sit here
for a few hours

10:16.717 --> 10:18.216
and wait
until he's really unstable

10:18.218 --> 10:19.951
and <i> then</i> take him
to the O.R.?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.286
If the lithotripsy works,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.254
maybe he never
even needs the O.R.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.624
The patient wants it,
his pressure's stable.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.626
Let's try it.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.862
Fine, but his chart will reflect
my recommendation...

10:30.864 --> 10:32.263
Surgery.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.065
Yeah.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.867
Thank you for backing me up.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.136
I was backing <i> Dylan</i> up.
He wants the lithotripsy.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.171
So go ahead and get him prepped,
and I'll run the machine.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.306
I'll let him know.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.974
You just made his night.

10:44.378 --> 10:47.212
Whoa. You guys
wear enough layers?

10:47.214 --> 10:50.348
This machine uses sound waves to
help break up the kidney stone.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.651
It's much more likely
you'll pass the pieces

10:52.653 --> 10:53.918
than one big stone.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.353
In other words,
I'm gonna pee out some rocks.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.223
That's one way
of putting it, yeah.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.059
Jordan, thanks for not
going all end-of-times on me

11:01.061 --> 11:02.661
with that other doctor.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.895
Yeah, he was a bit of a...

11:03.897 --> 11:05.063
He was a dick.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.665
Yeah.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.333
Okay, here we go.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.904
Oh.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.843
Oh, come on.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.912
What's happening?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.715
This thing needs
a complete reboot.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.950
Call the company.
Tell them to send a tech.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.819
Let me know when it's all fixed.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.087
Okay.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.354
Well, that blows.
Now what?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.023
We get it fixed.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.694
And if not, surgery, right?

11:35.696 --> 11:38.096
Don't worry.
We'll get it fixed.

11:38.098 --> 11:38.930
Okay?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.298
Okay.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.702
Incoming!

11:43.704 --> 11:45.053
Scott, we need the O.R.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.403
Estimated blood loss?
At least 3 liters.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.006
I put in some sutures
to slow the bleeding.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.774
O.R. 1 is prepped
and ready to go.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.743
I'm not liking mom's odds.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.111
I'm gonna call
the social worker.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.113
Good thinking.
I'll be in with Brianna.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.115
Tee, I got another one coming
in... asked for you by name.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.266
You want it?

11:58.267 --> 11:59.416
Yeah, just while Toph
is in C.T.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.286
When those labs are back,
will you call me?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.387
You got it.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.322
Oh.
Congratulations, Kenny.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.124
Congratulations on what?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.793
Yeah, I need your case manager.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.463
So, I know it's not the most
comfortable thing in the world,

12:11.465 --> 12:13.898
but the splint
will help your fracture heal.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.067
What's going on
with my foster mom?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.502
Is she gonna be okay?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.872
We got our top doctors
working on her.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.308
So as soon as I know more,
I'll let you know.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.210
I promise.

12:25.211 --> 12:27.111
Now, in the meantime,
Nina, your social worker,

12:27.114 --> 12:29.247
is gonna come hang out with you.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.816
Oh. Okay.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.052
What's that? What...
You don't like her?

12:34.054 --> 12:37.021
No, I do.
She's pretty badass.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.957
But you wouldn't be calling her

12:38.959 --> 12:41.359
unless it was bad news
about my foster mom.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.028
She always gets called in
when it's bad news.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.680
Well, that's not true.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.331
I mean, that's not the reason
we called her.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.200
She's just got to know
what's going on, right?

12:49.202 --> 12:53.037
So you're saying my foster mom
isn't going to die?

12:53.039 --> 12:58.810
I'm saying that we don't know...
Anything yet.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.045
So we just got to
give those doctors some time.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.447
Okay?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.886
"The lion, the witch,
and the wardrobe."

13:07.888 --> 13:09.087
I love this book.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.089
So, what part are you at?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.824
I'm not at a part.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.259
You just started reading it?

13:14.261 --> 13:16.261
Nice.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.262
No, I've read it before...
Like, a lot.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.231
It's pretty much
my favorite book.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.966
It's pretty much
<i>my</i> favorite book.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.335
I know what you're doing.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.939
You're just trying to distract
me until Nina gets here.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.007
You don't have to.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.675
What if I <i> want</i> to?

13:30.676 --> 13:32.342
You ever think of that,
miss smarty pants?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.912
So, let's talk about it.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.815
- First off...
- Edmund.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.601
I bet you like him
the least, right?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.053
Don't get me started.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.196
What if it's a dissection?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.882
Heart failure?

13:53.883 --> 13:56.567
I know she's tough,
but... Open-heart surgery?

13:56.570 --> 13:59.137
Here. Come here.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.438
You're driving yourself crazy.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.140
Okay, you can't let yourself
go there

14:02.142 --> 14:03.474
until we have the results back.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.277
I complain about her constantly.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.346
I'm always short with her.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.984
She can't work the computer
b-because she's old.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.854
I should be more patient
with her.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.388
I just...
I-i-i had to go to work.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.389
Hey.
I couldn't...

14:18.391 --> 14:20.258
We brought her into our home,

14:20.260 --> 14:23.194
and it was an adjustment,
but we've done it.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.997
And you are an amazing son.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.199
Don't beat yourself up
over the little things.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.102
But what if, Janet?

14:31.104 --> 14:35.473
What if... My last chance
to say something nice to her

14:35.475 --> 14:37.492
already happened?

14:37.493 --> 14:39.510
All I did was be short with her
this afternoon.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.912
What am I gonna do if my mom dies tonight?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.589
Hey. Clive.
What's... what's the matter?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.258
Fainted at the casino.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.492
Chest pains.
B.P.'s sky-high.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.261
She's exaggerating, T.C.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.896
Just a little winded.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.148
Good to see you, though.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.399
I had her call ahead so I can
get the v.I.P. Treatment.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.268
'Course you did.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.386
Yo, tee.

15:04.387 --> 15:05.503
Mama Topher's test results
are in.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.938
Okay, great.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.372
Uh, curtain 2.
Get some bilateral pressures.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.108
Clive, we will fix you right up.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.442
Enjoy.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.345
You know, I fought
the communists in nam.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.081
Mm. You know,
I wasn't even born then.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.149
Really?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.801
All normal.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.452
But you know Topher. He's
insisting we run them again.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.754
Right. Okay.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.055
The minute they're out of C.T.,
let me know.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.623
You got it.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.958
Kenny, congrats.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.426
Hey, for what?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.528
Oh, c... is somebody
playing a joke? Come on.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.298
Yeah, that's right...
I did call 10 minutes ago,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.966
and I'm gonna keep calling

15:34.967 --> 15:36.687
until I hear
from Brianna Holt's caseworker.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.170
No, you listen to me.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.639
You get someone here <i> now,</i>
because this young girl

15:41.641 --> 15:44.108
shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.144
Get... Someone... Here.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.479
Suction, Paul.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.620
Left four messages.
They're not answering the 800 number.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.689
I also checked the nurse
message boards, but nothing.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.090
Okay, thank you, Jocelyn.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.158
Yeah.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.095
Guess it <i> is</i> looking
more like surgery.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.698
Oh, well. What guy doesn't want
a petrified pubic area?

16:06.700 --> 16:09.567
Hey. We're not
giving up, okay?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.969
We may not have a choice.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.404
This is starting to really hurt.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.540
Okay, I can give you something
for the pain.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.076
Is there anything else
that you need

16:18.078 --> 16:19.210
before I try calling again?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.378
My sanity back?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.347
Every time
I'm back in the hospital,

16:22.349 --> 16:25.550
it's like a constant cycle of
"should" going through my head.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.252
"Should have been more careful.
"Should have had more water.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.620
"Should have ordered the salad

16:29.622 --> 16:31.222
instead of
the five-alarm chili."

16:31.224 --> 16:33.324
Buddy, you got to give yourself
a break, all right?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.193
You can't second-guess yourself
this much.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.528
Trust me, I have spent
half my life doing it,

16:37.530 --> 16:40.231
and that way, madness lies.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.984
All right.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.601
I'm gonna see if there's
another number that I can...

16:44.604 --> 16:46.571
Call.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.040
Son of a bitch.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.441
Pressler pharmaceuticals
makes this machine.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.654
Well, great.

16:51.655 --> 16:52.866
If that question
comes up on "jeopardy!"

16:52.867 --> 16:54.078
I'm gonna be sure to remember it.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.046
Thank you.
No, no, no.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.047
I-I think I know somebody

16:56.049 --> 16:57.782
who might be able to help us.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.587
Okay.
Sorry about the wait.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.021
Labs are slow today.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.174
How you been, old man?

17:06.175 --> 17:08.325
Last time I saw you, you gave me
three to six months to live.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.361
And let me tell you,
I've been living.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.163
Well, that's what you wanted.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.265
So, uh, you've been taking
care of yourself, right?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.599
Taking those meds
we talked about?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.535
You know, that nitro patch
you gave me

17:17.537 --> 17:18.669
is giving me headaches.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.171
Anything you can do about it?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.406
Yeah.
Let me get a look.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.473
Maybe I can cut it down in size.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.541
Yeah.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.079
Yeah, I don't see anything, man.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.314
It was there this afternoon.
I saw it.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.116
Okay. I'll look.
Maybe it fell off.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.668
You know, not wearing it

17:33.669 --> 17:35.219
is probably what brought
your blood pressure up,

17:35.221 --> 17:36.754
and that's what's caused
your chest pains.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.289
Oh.
I'll order you a new one.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.690
In the meantime,
I want to keep you here

17:39.692 --> 17:41.359
under observation
on a heart monitor, okay?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.361
Thank you.
I owe you one.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.296
Don't mention it.
Just doing my job.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.066
No, you know that broad
you introduced me to... sumei?

17:48.068 --> 17:50.268
Uh-huh.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.469
Well, she and I are becoming
intimately acquainted.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.239
I tell you...
She's one hell of a gal.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.474
Wow.
Oh, yeah.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.776
Okay, so, you two
have been, uh...

17:58.778 --> 18:00.178
We're seeing each other.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.412
Just this afternoon, we...

18:01.414 --> 18:02.680
Hold on.
What?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.515
You saw Mrs. Zia
this afternoon?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.084
Mm-hmm.
How did she seem to you?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.252
Because she came in tonight.
She was a little altered.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.620
Sumei?
She was fine.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.522
What's wrong with her?

18:11.523 --> 18:13.603
You didn't notice any dizziness,
shortness of breath?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.461
Okay.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.728
What?
Son of a bitch.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.830
I know what's going on.

18:18.832 --> 18:19.864
What?

18:19.866 --> 18:21.332
Topher!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.403
Nitroglycerine patch.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.454
What?

18:26.455 --> 18:27.504
Check her for a nitro patch.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.806
Well, why would she have a...

18:28.808 --> 18:30.108
Just... just check her.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.345
Ma, can you roll to your side?

18:35.981 --> 18:37.701
- Janet, can you give me a hand?
- Oh, yeah.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.119
There <i> is</i> something down there.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.356
Hmm?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.490
Yeah, that's a nitro patch.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.624
Ma?
Hmm?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.392
Where did this come from?

18:48.394 --> 18:50.394
This is probably what's been
causing your symptoms.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.363
Uh, Toph, you got a second?

18:52.365 --> 18:53.498
Right.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.800
What the hell, man?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.819
How did you...
How did you...

18:57.820 --> 18:59.837
So, the good news
is that your mom is fine, right?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.339
Her symptoms are
all from the patch.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.874
Right.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.408
The bad news...
At least for <i> you...</i>

19:04.410 --> 19:05.810
Is, um...

19:05.812 --> 19:07.311
Your mom's having sex.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.479
What?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.281
Yeah, with clive.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.866
Who's clive?

19:11.867 --> 19:13.450
Remember the old dude
from the casino?

19:13.453 --> 19:15.520
He just told me
that he and your mom are dating.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.588
Yeah, he came in today
complaining of chest pains,

19:17.590 --> 19:19.390
and it's 'cause
his nitro patch fell off.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.725
So it must have
rubbed off on your mom

19:20.727 --> 19:22.710
while they were doing it.

19:22.711 --> 19:24.694
No, stop. That's way too much
for me to take in right now.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.864
You got a visual?
In your head?

19:26.866 --> 19:29.433
Yeah, okay. Let's not
have a discussion about it.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.502
Good job, Mrs. Toph.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.171
Mm.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.208
- Stop. S-s-stop laughing.
- What?

19:39.913 --> 19:42.613
Hey, it's...
It's not looking good.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.749
So she's not gonna make it?

19:44.751 --> 19:46.884
You know, she came in
with massive injuries.

19:46.886 --> 19:47.885
I know. It's just...

19:47.887 --> 19:49.287
She has this foster daughter,

19:49.289 --> 19:50.788
and she was just
so concerned about her.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.423
You could tell how much
she really loves her.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.624
A foster mom.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.527
So if she
doesn't make it, then...

19:56.529 --> 19:58.763
Then the girl goes
back in the system.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.965
She was so close
to having a family,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.833
and it all just
gets taken from her.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.536
It's not fair.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.238
You got to do everything
you can to save her mom, Paul.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.407
Promise me?

20:09.409 --> 20:10.675
We'll do our best.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.543
Do more than your best!

20:12.545 --> 20:14.412
Please.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.247
You don't know what it's like.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.649
You're moved from home to home.
Nothing is ever your own.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.785
And then, just when you finally
get used to someone,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.753
you finally are shown
some kindness in your life,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.755
it's all just taken away.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.525
Shannon.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.595
Was...
Was that <i> your</i> life?

20:30.597 --> 20:32.897
<i>Paul, transfusion's done.</i>

20:32.899 --> 20:34.265
<i>We're ready.</i>

20:35.935 --> 20:37.668
Fight for her, Paul.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.837
That little girl
can't be alone again.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.906
Brianna.

20:58.907 --> 21:00.390
How's the chest p.T.
Working?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.626
Feeling better?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.394
Yeah. I'm all right.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.663
Well,
your x-rays came back,

21:05.665 --> 21:07.999
and you have a small area
of pneumonia.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.767
That's what's been
making the breathing harder,

21:09.769 --> 21:11.936
but you just got to
take this medication

21:11.938 --> 21:14.538
and some antibiotics.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.340
Should make
the breathing easier.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.445
Thanks.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.747
Yeah.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.819
Edmund's such a turd...

21:28.821 --> 21:30.788
Giving up his family like that.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.958
He's a turd?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.360
I guess you could
call him a jerk.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.162
Hmm.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.963
You know, I don't get
why you love him so much.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.365
I wouldn't say "love."

21:41.367 --> 21:42.967
Yeah, when he first
gets to narnia,

21:42.969 --> 21:44.902
he ruins everything.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.836
<i>That's</i> the Edmund
I want to punch in the teeth,

21:46.839 --> 21:48.706
but in the end, what does he do?

21:48.708 --> 21:50.841
He helps his family
kill the white witch.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.160
He changes.

21:53.161 --> 21:55.478
And I think that's
what makes Edmund not a turd.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.581
I think that's pretty cool.
Don't <i> you?</i>

21:57.583 --> 21:58.683
No.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.917
Okay.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.952
He has no idea how lucky he is.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.655
I mean, every kid
wants to go to narnia.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.590
When I go to a new foster house,

22:06.592 --> 22:08.592
I always check
all the closets...

22:08.594 --> 22:09.760
Just in case.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.663
Do you?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.699
I've spent some time in closets.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.335
I bet they don't have
breathing treatments in narnia.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.337
No one's ever sick there.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.505
Drew?
Do you have a minute?

22:21.507 --> 22:22.406
Yeah.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.909
Uh, I'll be right back.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.417
- It's been 10 minutes.
- All right.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.752
Doctors Alister and Rivera,

22:34.754 --> 22:37.088
this is Brianna's social worker,
Nina Alvarez.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.057
She finally made it.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.025
Hey, robonurse,
I have seen 10 kids tonight

22:41.027 --> 22:42.727
and still need to check
on another 10 before sunrise,

22:42.729 --> 22:43.995
so watch your mouth.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.262
Sorry. Just calling it
like it is.

22:45.263 --> 22:46.529
No, hey. He didn't
mean it that way.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.132
We've all just taken to Brianna.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.667
Kenny's just being protective.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.435
Good.
She deserves it.

22:51.437 --> 22:54.538
I mean, all these cases suck,
but I admit she's special.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.440
So, where we at?

22:56.442 --> 22:58.776
Uh, well, I just diagnosed
Brianna with pneumonia.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.911
I think some oral antibiotics,
she'll be fine.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.113
How are her oxygen levels?

23:02.115 --> 23:03.781
They're okay.
That's good.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.716
How's Avery doing?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.518
She's not gonna make it.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.337
Does Brianna know?

23:09.338 --> 23:11.155
We didn't want to say anything
until we knew for sure.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.557
We're worried
she's gonna shut down,

23:13.559 --> 23:14.792
losing someone else.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.994
Okay.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.129
Look, the longer we wait,

23:18.131 --> 23:19.663
the harder
it's gonna be for her.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.132
Brianna doesn't trust
a lot of people.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.000
We need to be honest with her.

23:24.804 --> 23:25.836
Hey, Kenny.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.138
Congratulations!

23:27.140 --> 23:28.706
Okay, what's going on?

23:28.708 --> 23:29.707
Jessica. Hi.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.409
Thank you so much for coming in.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.777
I really owe you one.

23:32.779 --> 23:33.944
You owe her <i> two.</i>

23:33.946 --> 23:35.613
Pat. Dude. Really?

23:35.615 --> 23:36.914
Someone's life is on the line.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.948
Just do your job.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.783
Whatever.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.950
Where are we going?

23:39.952 --> 23:40.818
Upstairs.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.637
Sorry.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.455
I got to say, I mean, I didn't
expect you to come in, you know?

23:44.457 --> 23:45.756
I called you
at 2:00 in the morning.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.991
I figured
you'd just send someone.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.826
You can <i> always</i> call me.
Thank you.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.095
Yeah, doctors aren't my clients.
Patients are.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.697
If they need me, I get out of bed.

23:53.699 --> 23:56.567
T-that's what you look like
when you get out of bed?

23:57.804 --> 23:58.804
Oh.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.038
Ma.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.175
I, uh, need to take you
back to your room.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.843
You said yourself...
I'm fine.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.978
I said your blood pressure
was stabilizing.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.714
It's not necessarily fine.
We still need to monitor you.

24:10.716 --> 24:12.149
And he needs his rest.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.886
Hey, clive, I have, uh,
the blood-test results.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.721
You want some privacy?

24:17.723 --> 24:19.723
Anything you can say
in front of me,

24:19.725 --> 24:22.059
you can say in front of sumei.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.127
Okay.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.863
Um, unfortunately,
they're not great.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.532
You had
another small heart attack.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.100
And, as I said before,

24:30.102 --> 24:32.002
your next one
could be your last.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.604
Clive, you never said
you have...

24:33.606 --> 24:36.006
No, I was just trying
to keep things light.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.209
You don't need
to hear about heart attacks.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.744
He elected to turn down
open-heart surgery

24:40.746 --> 24:42.146
'cause it's too dangerous.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.081
If I'd have let them open me up,

24:44.083 --> 24:47.551
I could have died
before we ever went to dinner.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.721
And there's nothing you can do?

24:50.723 --> 24:53.090
I'm sorry, Mrs. Zia.
The situation remains the same.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.527
He could die on the table.
His heart is very weak.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.596
That's not the clive <i> I</i> know.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.899
The clive I know
goes all-in for what he wants.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.802
Don't badger him, mom.
He's made up his mind.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.036
We'll let you rest.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.905
Good. You can go.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.040
Sumei can stay.

25:19.886 --> 25:20.918
Coffee?

25:20.920 --> 25:21.919
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.788
How much longer?

25:23.789 --> 25:25.656
Your guy said it'll be
up and running in 10 to 15.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.525
Mm.
Mmm!

25:27.527 --> 25:29.927
Oh, wow. This is not
cafeteria coffee.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.562
Where did you get this?

25:31.564 --> 25:32.930
I have a guy.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.132
Of course you do.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.668
Ow. Tinder.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.970
Uh, no. Bumble.
Oh.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.773
I am very much done with tinder.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.775
Not that it makes much of a difference.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.111
It kind of makes me regret
breaking up with my fireman Sam.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.113
You know?
Grass is always greener.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.581
Well, sometimes
when you're dating,

25:50.583 --> 25:52.316
the grass feels like
it's all burnt and barren.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.801
Seriously.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.285
Last thing you probably want

25:55.288 --> 25:56.921
is advice from the chick
screwing your ex.

25:56.923 --> 25:57.888
Sorry.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.957
It's okay. Really.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.191
Maybe it's because
I'm feeling better,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.893
or maybe it's because
I like you.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.161
Oh, cool.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.564
Or maybe it's just because

26:06.566 --> 26:09.199
you guys look
like you're actually happy.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.068
Yeah. We are.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.703
That's good.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.572
Okay, cards on the table?
Please.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.041
Okay, I think maybe it's easier
with him and me

26:17.043 --> 26:18.576
than it was with you guys

26:18.578 --> 26:21.145
just because we aren't really
strangled by a past.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.314
I guess it frees us up
to... Have fun.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.883
Whatever it is,
it's a good look on him.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.052
I like seeing him happy.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.854
Oh.
Oh.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.656
Dylan? It's okay,
I'm right here.

26:32.658 --> 26:33.857
I feel kind of...

26:33.859 --> 26:35.192
Hang in there, Dylan.
Kind of...

26:35.194 --> 26:37.127
Okay, pressure's dropping.
Hang levophed.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.295
His pulse is weak.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.047
Okay, he's septic.

26:40.048 --> 26:41.798
I need you to page Dr. park and
tell him to meet us at the O.R.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.934
We got to get
these kidney stones out <i> now.</i>

26:44.670 --> 26:46.270
No, she's not.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.871
She's gonna be fine 'cause...
'cause we can do something.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.139
Can't we do anything?

26:49.141 --> 26:50.641
I wish we could.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.877
But I-i just saw her.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.914
She was... she was fine.
She...

27:01.621 --> 27:02.820
Can I see her?

27:05.891 --> 27:07.791
Just to say goodbye.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.629
I called time of death
10 minutes ago.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.897
If the board found out
about that, they would fry us.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.800
Dr. Clemmens, Brianna
already feels responsible

27:16.802 --> 27:18.302
for Avery's death.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.671
And kids like this...
They don't have much.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.340
To lose the one person...
The one thing in their life...

27:23.342 --> 27:24.875
It's devastating.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.177
I promise
it will make a difference.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.780
As her social worker,
I'm signing off on this.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.415
She needs closure.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.049
Excuse me. Dr. Clemmens,
Jordan needs you.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.052
Her patient is headed
to the O.R.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.187
Okay, I'll be right there.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.656
Look, I have to go.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.691
I-I can do it.

27:40.692 --> 27:42.725
Keep coding her, make it look
like she's still alive.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.195
No, Paul. I'm not putting you
in that position.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.364
You're not putting me there.
<i>I</i> am.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.932
It's <i> my</i> decision.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.135
It's important to me.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.738
Okay.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.109
Okay.

28:05.685 --> 28:06.917
If we had operated
four hours ago,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.486
he wouldn't be crashing now.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.054
Hey, I'm the one
who could die on the table.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.989
Dr. Alexander was
listening to my wishes.

28:11.991 --> 28:12.957
What happened?

28:12.958 --> 28:13.924
He's septic.
Pressure's dropping.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.059
We're heading
into the O.R. now.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.060
Lithotripsy didn't work?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.061
We didn't get a chance
to try it.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.095
It wasn't repaired in time.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.513
It's still an option?

28:19.514 --> 28:20.930
Dylan,
your pressure is very low.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.466
It's getting dangerous
to not operate.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.935
Could we still try?
Yes, we can.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.071
It's risky, but it could work.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.338
That's insane.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.840
You need surgery.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.325
We still have time.

28:31.326 --> 28:32.809
If it doesn't work,
he's all yours.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.113
I'll be waiting.
Okay.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.314
Is this crazy?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.483
I've heard crazier ideas
tonight.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.418
Sometimes a hail Mary works.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.253
Jordan?

28:43.255 --> 28:45.823
If you need to trust someone,
Dr. Clemmens is your guy.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.962
Okay.
Here we go.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.797
Okay.

28:53.799 --> 28:56.100
Thanks for, uh,
holding down the fort, Kenny.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.168
I've been
a little distracted tonight.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.553
No doubt.

28:59.554 --> 29:01.074
I heard your mom's
getting some action.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.791
You told him?!

29:03.792 --> 29:05.242
No. No, I didn't.
I didn't say anything.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.810
I heard it
from ray, the orderly.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.345
And the C.T. department.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.680
And the blood lab.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.041
Is there <i> any</i> privacy
in this place?

29:12.017 --> 29:14.084
Oh, hey.
Congratulations.

29:14.086 --> 29:14.952
For what?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.220
I'm proud of you.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.122
What? Why does
everybody keep...

29:18.124 --> 29:20.157
Joss. Joss.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.192
Come on, tell me...
What's going on?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.761
Okay, fine.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.230
We nominated you
as our new union rep.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.898
You won
by a 15-0 vote.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.133
You're kidding me.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.034
I never kid about the union.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.103
But I...
I don't want that job.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.006
Then you probably shouldn't have
skipped the election meeting.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.207
Don't worry.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.443
I'll make it up to you.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.879
Mm-hmm!

29:45.885 --> 29:47.417
Uh, what's all this?

29:47.419 --> 29:49.052
We talked it over.

29:49.054 --> 29:52.222
I can't give up
on the love of my life.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.357
I'm rolling the dice.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.359
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.827
I'm counting the minutes.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.345
It won't be long.

29:58.346 --> 29:59.862
You have the best doctor
in this dump.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.365
My son won't let you die.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.432
Mm.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.437
You guys are too much.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.475
Hey, ma?
Why'd you say that?

30:11.477 --> 30:12.943
You know I'm not operating.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.178
I'm not an idiot.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.512
I'm giving him hope.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.215
Think of it as
blowing on his dice for luck.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.517
I'm not going anywhere near that one.
No.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.452
Now, take me down
to the cafeteria.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.588
I want to peruse
the jello selection.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.123
Oh...

30:26.125 --> 30:28.458
What? Don't look at <i> me.</i>
I have to leave.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.161
<i>Someone's</i> got to get our kids
ready for school.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.963
Mm. Bye.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.167
Jello?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.936
Okay.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.370
We have that.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.151
You can say
whatever you need to.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.428
Why does she look like that?

31:04.430 --> 31:06.864
Can she even hear me?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.332
She can.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.941
Avery...

31:17.943 --> 31:19.376
I love you.

31:21.113 --> 31:24.014
And I'll never forget you.

31:24.016 --> 31:29.086
You're the best mom
anybody could ever ask for.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.554
Please...

31:32.391 --> 31:34.524
I can't.
I don't want to say goodbye.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.493
Please don't make me!
I don't want...

31:42.001 --> 31:44.201
I'll go get her.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.906
Well, that was an epic fail.

31:48.908 --> 31:49.907
I don't think so.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.341
It was hard for her, obviously,

31:51.343 --> 31:54.211
but she would always regret
not doing it.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.146
So, how long
were you in the system?

31:56.148 --> 31:58.282
That obvious?

31:58.283 --> 32:00.417
To someone who spends 80 hours
a week working in it, yeah.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.052
Too long.

32:05.273 --> 32:07.490
Hey, you need to take a couple
puffs from your inhaler.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.338
How'd you find me?

32:21.340 --> 32:24.141
I checked
every closet on the floor.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.709
I knew you'd be in one of them.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.644
Yeah, well, I'm still here.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.048
No forest in this one.

32:31.050 --> 32:34.051
No.
That's the bad part.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.419
There never is.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.589
I know there's nothing
in the world I can say right now

32:39.591 --> 32:42.559
to make you feel any better.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.628
So I'm just gonna
sit here with you.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.666
What am I gonna do without her?

32:49.668 --> 32:52.002
I don't know.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.091
Nina.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.559
Hey, I just got a text
from drew.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.760
Uh, Brianna's all right.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.362
Yes, I heard.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.997
Thank you.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.566
Can I get you something?

33:22.568 --> 33:24.634
Yeah, you got a time machine?

33:26.005 --> 33:28.205
I could use one of those myself.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.073
Yeah?
Where would you go?

33:30.075 --> 33:33.243
August 6, 2001,
7:14 A.M.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.611
Wow.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.380
What happened then?

33:38.150 --> 33:40.250
Just some old football thing.
What about <i> you?</i>

33:40.252 --> 33:42.336
10 hours ago.

33:42.337 --> 33:44.421
Get Avery off the road.
Then Brianna wouldn't be alone.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.690
She's not alone.
She has <i> you.</i>

33:46.692 --> 33:49.159
Right.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.561
Except she <i> will</i> be.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.096
I'm a caseworker.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.532
Like I said earlier,
I've got 25 kids,

33:55.534 --> 33:58.769
and she needs parents...
A permanent home.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.505
Jesus.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.440
But right now, she just needs
a place for tonight.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.142
She can't stay with <i> you?</i>

34:05.144 --> 34:07.077
It doesn't work that fast.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.312
Besides, I've already got
two foster kids at home

34:09.313 --> 34:11.681
with me and my parents now.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.384
No room at the inn.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.253
What if...
What if she stayed <i> here?</i>

34:16.255 --> 34:18.321
I mean, pneumonia's
grounds for admission.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.257
Her oxygen levels are fine.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.458
I mean, it's mild...
At very worst, moderate.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.395
Not if one of the doctors thinks
she'd benefit from admission.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.530
Huh?

34:26.532 --> 34:28.047
And I know three

34:28.049 --> 34:29.768
who are looking to help
in any way they can.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.702
So, how close
would you say we were?

34:32.704 --> 34:35.772
Let's just say it's good you
passed that stone when you did.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.309
Some high-stakes pee.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.744
Hey, Jocelyn. Could you
take Dylan to recovery?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.712
Whoa, wait.
W-we're done? That's it?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.069
Yeah.

34:44.070 --> 34:45.425
I was kind of feeling like
we were like

34:45.426 --> 34:46.781
the three musketeers there
or something for a second,

34:46.784 --> 34:47.684
you know?

34:47.686 --> 34:48.717
All for one, right?

34:48.719 --> 34:49.786
We make a good team.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.855
Yeah. We do.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.590
All right, I'll check in on you
later, okay?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.824
Okay.
All right, buddy.

34:54.827 --> 34:56.193
All right.
Bye, guys.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.194
So long, docs.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.196
Hi, Jocelyn.
How you feeling?

34:59.198 --> 35:01.298
Funny guy.
Yeah.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.771
Jordan, can we start over?

35:07.773 --> 35:11.408
At least from, like,
two weeks ago?

35:11.410 --> 35:14.411
Mm. You mean when I opened
my big mouth about Annie?

35:14.413 --> 35:17.547
And when I acted
like a dick to you.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.585
I'm not gonna lie...
I think part of me

35:21.587 --> 35:25.355
wanted to rub your face in it
a little bit.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.857
The way I felt
when you and T.C...

35:26.859 --> 35:28.825
Scott, I never wanted
to make you feel like...

35:28.827 --> 35:30.594
No, no, I know.
I know.

35:30.596 --> 35:34.764
But seeing you two together...

35:34.766 --> 35:36.199
It still hurt.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.852
Mm.

35:38.853 --> 35:41.504
Well, maybe going back two weeks
isn't going to be enough.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.141
It'll have to be.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.876
I do care about Annie.

35:45.878 --> 35:48.645
And I know you guys
have history. I know that.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.381
But I don't have
that same baggage with her.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.684
So... It works for us.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.170
Yeah.

35:57.171 --> 35:59.655
Well, I am learning
that I have a lot more baggage

35:59.658 --> 36:01.424
than I realized, so...

36:01.426 --> 36:02.692
Yeah, well, we <i> all</i> do.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.795
It's what you do with it
that counts, I guess.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.397
Yeah.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.832
All right.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.200
I'll see you around.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.835
Bye, Scott.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.745
Thank you for admitting her.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.132
I know it's not ideal,

36:25.133 --> 36:26.950
but it's better than
a temporary housing situation.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.818
And we'll take good care of her

36:28.820 --> 36:31.655
until you find
the right home for her.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.256
Uh, could you give this to her?

36:33.258 --> 36:34.891
Oh. She'll kill me
if I <i> don't.</i>

36:34.893 --> 36:36.226
Yeah.

36:37.629 --> 36:38.895
What are you doing?

36:38.897 --> 36:40.497
Writing in my phone number
so she can reach me

36:40.499 --> 36:42.432
any time she needs to.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.569
Okay, you put your number
in there, you better mean it.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.504
She calls you, you pick up.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.706
She doesn't need
any more disappointment.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.942
I'll pick up.

36:51.944 --> 36:55.512
And I'll check on her
every day that she's here.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.626
Hey, ma.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.863
Still nothing?

37:13.865 --> 37:14.931
No, not yet.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.504
Um...

37:21.506 --> 37:23.907
Hey, ma,
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry

37:23.909 --> 37:27.310
for stepping in
between you and clive.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.849
That wasn't my place.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.017
And, um, I'm sorry
for getting annoyed with you

37:35.020 --> 37:38.321
and...
Being short with you.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.856
It's okay.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.358
You're family.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.026
You're allowed. Hmm?

37:43.028 --> 37:44.761
Earlier tonight,

37:44.763 --> 37:48.031
I thought...
I thought I was losing you.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.771
I know you did.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.644
But you're not
getting rid of me <i> that</i> easy.

38:02.597 --> 38:04.547
You know, your grandmother
made it to 97.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.516
And I plan to outlive her.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.753
Um...
Okay.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.454
I wanted to tell you
in person...

38:11.456 --> 38:12.656
Clive's out of surgery.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.391
He's awake.
You can see him now.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.925
Thank you.

38:15.927 --> 38:16.926
Thanks, Paul.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.528
Yeah.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.065
Thank you.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.935
Thank you.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.471
You know you don't have to come
every time my ex calls, right?

38:28.473 --> 38:31.408
How about, "thanks for
saving a patient's life"?

38:31.410 --> 38:32.942
Well, I guess
I could have led with that.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.678
I'm just messing with you.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.646
I didn't come
because Jordan called me.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.814
I came to help a patient.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.816
There's a reason
I don't work at a bank.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.085
Speaking of which,
I got to go... get some sleep.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.987
Ohh. Can I come?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.588
No, I actually need sleep.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.240
Mm, no.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.891
I have a really big
job interview in a few hours.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.960
Yeah? For what?

38:50.962 --> 38:54.364
Unh-unh. Nope.
Not gonna jinx it.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.098
Okay.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.366
Mmm.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.502
Good luck.
Yeah.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.938
Hey. Heard it all worked out...
For now.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.541
Yeah... for now.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.742
Thank you.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.377
You got it.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.581
Uh...

39:11.583 --> 39:14.718
You know, um,
I pretty much work nonstop,

39:14.720 --> 39:17.520
live with my parents,
take care of two foster kids,

39:17.522 --> 39:20.857
so it's not exactly the sexiest
lifestyle a woman could have.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.559
Um...

39:22.561 --> 39:25.495
But if you ever wanted to
get together for a coffee or...

39:25.497 --> 39:27.864
Oh. Um...

39:27.866 --> 39:29.899
Ooh! Okay.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.968
Wow. Well, maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.371
But I'm not very good
at <i> not</i> saying anything.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.106
You just, um...

39:36.108 --> 39:38.007
You seem like a really good guy,

39:38.009 --> 39:40.944
and I don't meet a lot
of good guys in my line of work.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.612
Hey, well,
today's your lucky day.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.687
Ball's in your court.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.761
I didn't...
She just...

39:57.763 --> 39:59.813
I saw.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.864
Look, I know we're just
doing whatever, and it's cool.

40:01.867 --> 40:05.034
I mean, if you want to go out
with her, I get it.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.803
Just let me know first, Kenny.

40:06.805 --> 40:10.440
I don't want to hear about
your sex life from Mollie.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.448
Yo.

40:18.450 --> 40:19.749
You okay?

40:19.751 --> 40:20.917
Yeah, I <i> am</i> now.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.452
Thanks for tonight.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.686
You saved my mom.

40:23.688 --> 40:26.189
Anytime.
You know that.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.091
I do have
one more question, though.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.910
What's that?

40:29.911 --> 40:31.728
Are you gonna start
calling clive "dad" now?

40:32.931 --> 40:34.063
Shut up.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.799
Daddy. Pops. Pop-pops.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.133
I don't want to hear it!

40:37.135 --> 40:39.669
Is he gonna stay over?
In the same bed?

40:39.671 --> 40:42.572
What are you gonna do if you start
hearing them through the wall?

40:42.574 --> 40:44.073
Uh... Toph.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.710
I can't hear you!

40:47.712 --> 40:49.179
I-I can't hear you!

40:49.181 --> 40:50.547
I don't have any change!

40:53.485 --> 40:54.485
Hey.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.220
Thanks for all your help
tonight...

40:57.222 --> 40:58.888
For stepping up like that.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.557
Oh. Uh, please.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.826
Anything for a kid, you know?

41:04.496 --> 41:07.931
And, I, uh... I knew
it was important to <i> you.</i>

41:20.111 --> 41:21.744
Get in.

41:21.746 --> 41:22.846
In... in there?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.351
- So... What did you... what did you want...
- Shut up, Paul.
