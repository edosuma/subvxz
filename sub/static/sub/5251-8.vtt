WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.239
>> RONDA: I don't understand why

00:05.239 --> 00:06.240
you're putting "Bruce" as

00:06.240 --> 00:07.241
opposed to "Caitlyn."

00:07.241 --> 00:08.242
>> CAITLYN: My membership is

00:08.242 --> 00:09.243
under "Bruce."

00:09.243 --> 00:10.244
>> CANDIS: You can't play both

00:10.244 --> 00:11.845
sides of the fence anymore.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.347
There's no excuse-- just sign

00:13.347 --> 00:14.815
your name as Caitlyn and move

00:14.815 --> 00:16.517
on.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.618
>> CAITLYN: Certain family

00:17.618 --> 00:19.653
members are upset with the

00:19.653 --> 00:20.654
Vanity Fair article.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.655
>> KHLOE: We want to support you

00:21.655 --> 00:23.157
and be there for you, but we

00:23.157 --> 00:24.792
don't think that that entails

00:24.792 --> 00:27.461
you speaking negatively about my

00:27.461 --> 00:28.862
mom, especially when you have

00:28.862 --> 00:30.030
two young daughters who are

00:30.030 --> 00:31.199
greatly affected by it.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.500
>> KIM: She really loved you and

00:32.500 --> 00:34.235
cherished your 25 years together

00:34.235 --> 00:35.236
as a family.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.237
>> CAITLYN: And I loved her,

00:36.237 --> 00:37.238
too.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.940
I've never once tried to do

00:39.940 --> 00:41.575
anything that would hurt her.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.677
Honestly, I wish she would call.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.213
I have not seen her, talked to

00:45.213 --> 00:46.347
her...

00:46.347 --> 00:48.249
(knocking)

00:48.249 --> 00:50.118
...months and months and months.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.152
>> KRIS: Where do you want to

00:51.152 --> 00:52.153
go?

00:52.153 --> 00:53.154
>> CAITLYN: Sit down here.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.123
>> KRIS: Okay.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.135
>> CAITLYN: So... how are you

01:07.135 --> 01:08.136
doing?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.403
>> KRIS: I'm good.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.838
I'm really good.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.206
Just working.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.207
>> CAITLYN: Well, I haven't

01:13.207 --> 01:16.377
heard from you in forever.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.778
>> KRIS: Yeah.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.779
>> CAITLYN: It's been at

01:18.779 --> 01:22.716
least... six months.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.452
>> KRIS: I just felt thrown

01:24.452 --> 01:26.587
under the bridge.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.890
You were so excited to be going

01:29.890 --> 01:31.259
through this exciting time in

01:31.259 --> 01:34.328
your life, but I feel like...

01:34.328 --> 01:37.531
I really... was blindsided in a

01:37.531 --> 01:39.233
lot of ways, and that really got

01:39.233 --> 01:43.171
to me so bad that I couldn't...

01:43.171 --> 01:44.772
I didn't want to communicate

01:44.772 --> 01:47.175
with you and be angry and be...

01:47.175 --> 01:48.176
>> CAITLYN: What would you be

01:48.176 --> 01:50.478
angry for?

01:50.478 --> 01:51.645
>> KRIS: It doesn't even matter

01:51.645 --> 01:52.646
anymore.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.647
>> CAITLYN: Yes, it does.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.182
>> KRIS: No.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.183
>> CAITLYN: 'Cause it affects

01:55.183 --> 01:56.184
the kids.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.185
>> KRIS: One of the reasons I

01:57.185 --> 01:58.186
wanted to talk to you was

01:58.186 --> 01:59.287
because I don't want your

01:59.287 --> 02:00.621
feelings to be hurt, like the

02:00.621 --> 02:02.756
other day, when I heard that you

02:02.756 --> 02:04.725
weren't happy about not being

02:04.725 --> 02:06.727
included in Kylie's graduation.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.095
>> CAITLYN: It wasn't me making

02:08.095 --> 02:09.930
that decision, it was you making

02:09.930 --> 02:13.334
that decision.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.868
I was so disappointed in

02:14.868 --> 02:16.904
everybody.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.639
For 15 years of my life,

02:18.639 --> 02:19.940
I carpooled kids every day.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.475
Some days I would spend three or

02:21.475 --> 02:23.644
four hours a day in the car.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.913
A slap in the face when you

02:25.913 --> 02:27.881
don't even get invited to their

02:27.881 --> 02:28.882
graduation.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.017
>> KRIS: That's exactly how I

02:30.017 --> 02:30.951
felt with the Vanity Fair

02:30.951 --> 02:31.852
article, 'cause I...

02:31.852 --> 02:32.553
>> CAITLYN: Okay, it's not tit

02:32.553 --> 02:33.221
for tat, it's not tit for tat.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.522
>> KRIS: ...spent 25 years of

02:34.522 --> 02:35.789
my life and 18 hours a day and

02:35.789 --> 02:36.690
blah, blah, blah...

02:36.690 --> 02:37.691
>> CAITLYN: Vanity Fair was

02:37.691 --> 02:38.226
months ago.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.227
We're talking about what

02:39.227 --> 02:40.394
happened just a few days ago.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.795
>> KRIS: Listen, usually people

02:41.795 --> 02:43.397
that get a divorce don't do

02:43.397 --> 02:45.032
everything together.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.034
It wasn't malicious, it didn't

02:47.034 --> 02:48.101
intend to hurt anybody's

02:48.101 --> 02:50.571
feelings, but my feelings still

02:50.571 --> 02:52.072
weren't healed.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.242
And I thought, wow, this is the

02:54.242 --> 02:58.346
guy...

02:58.346 --> 03:00.481
that...

03:00.481 --> 03:03.817
when I, you know... (sniffles)

03:03.817 --> 03:05.986
I-I told myself I don't even

03:05.986 --> 03:07.555
want to cry, but I just, it just

03:07.555 --> 03:09.557
hurt my feelings.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.025
I didn't understand why you felt

03:12.025 --> 03:15.596
the need to... criticize or make

03:15.596 --> 03:17.265
me look bad.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.266
Like, were you... did you live

03:18.266 --> 03:19.166
in the same house that I lived

03:19.166 --> 03:20.167
in?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.570
'Cause... it was (bleep)

03:22.570 --> 03:24.137
amazing.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.274
And I worked really hard, and

03:26.274 --> 03:28.442
I... like, I... took care of

03:28.442 --> 03:29.510
you.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.511
>> CAITLYN: I never... said...

03:30.511 --> 03:32.280
>> KRIS: ...for decades.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.914
And so to have-- what did you

03:33.914 --> 03:37.184
say?-- I... I "mistreated" you.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.652
It was, like, mistreated you?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.554
Yeah, we fought like cats and

03:40.554 --> 03:41.722
dogs for the last couple of

03:41.722 --> 03:43.023
years-- but that's not what you

03:43.023 --> 03:46.360
say in a Vanity Fair article.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.362
(crying): And it just killed me.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.097
Because it wasn't true.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.965
And that-that's just, you know,

03:51.965 --> 03:53.100
it was, like, what happened

03:53.100 --> 03:54.435
to... just the life we had

03:54.435 --> 03:55.436
together?

03:55.436 --> 03:56.670
It's, like, you don't... you

03:56.670 --> 03:58.472
just threw that away.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.841
How much fun we had and the kids

04:00.841 --> 04:02.543
we raised and Christmas Eves and

04:02.543 --> 04:05.813
just every single thing we did.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.748
(sniffles) So it's very

04:07.748 --> 04:10.351
difficult to hear when you feel

04:10.351 --> 04:12.320
like you've been... you gave

04:12.320 --> 04:14.988
your whole life to somebody...

04:14.988 --> 04:16.023
that the sum of it all was...

04:16.023 --> 04:17.024
>> CAITLYN (whispers): Okay.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.025
>> KRIS: ...you were a

04:18.025 --> 04:18.792
distraction.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.328
And so that's... that killed me.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.161
>> CAITLYN: Can we...? Look...

04:21.161 --> 04:22.430
I don't want anybody

04:22.430 --> 04:23.597
to feel bad.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.598
I-I never thought our

04:24.598 --> 04:25.899
relationship was a distraction.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.100
Our relationship was a great

04:27.100 --> 04:28.201
relationship for many, many

04:28.201 --> 04:29.337
years.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.738
Loved you, adored you, we had

04:30.738 --> 04:32.005
a lot of great years together.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.374
And I have no regrets for that.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.775
It was a distraction from the

04:34.775 --> 04:36.444
sense of who I was.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.711
I didn't have to deal with

04:37.711 --> 04:41.048
myself... and who my soul was.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.783
So that's the distraction.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.452
It's all in the way that you

04:44.452 --> 04:45.819
look at these things.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.220
As far as the Vanity Fair

04:47.220 --> 04:49.923
article was, uh, I tried

04:49.923 --> 04:51.425
everything to have your back.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.793
I thought I was very kind and

04:52.793 --> 04:53.861
nice to you.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.162
I didn't say anything that was

04:55.162 --> 04:56.697
bad.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.098
>> KRIS: Yeah.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.433
>> CAITLYN: I would say the

04:59.433 --> 05:02.035
reason for our breakup was about

05:02.035 --> 05:03.671
80% about the way you were

05:03.671 --> 05:05.739
treating me and 20% on gender

05:05.739 --> 05:06.907
issues.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.476
>> KRIS: But you can't say that

05:08.476 --> 05:10.578
you've known about these... that

05:10.578 --> 05:12.380
you knew you wanted to be a

05:12.380 --> 05:13.447
woman since you were four years

05:13.447 --> 05:14.515
old, and then turn around...

05:14.515 --> 05:15.916
>> CAITLYN: No, wait, wait,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.150
wait-- I have lived for 65

05:17.150 --> 05:17.851
years, 65 years.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.519
>> KRIS: But then you can't say

05:18.519 --> 05:19.420
it's 20% of the problem.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.187
>> CAITLYN: It wasn't till

05:20.187 --> 05:21.389
later on-- I did not leave you

05:21.389 --> 05:22.222
thinking I was going

05:22.222 --> 05:24.558
to transition, okay?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.994
That... No.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.261
I didn't know what I was going

05:28.261 --> 05:29.262
to do.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.964
I never thought I'd be here.

05:30.964 --> 05:31.965
>> KRIS (sniffles): And I'm

05:31.965 --> 05:33.266
really happy for you, I really

05:33.266 --> 05:35.068
am.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.604
Because I want you to be happy.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.605
>> CAITLYN: You never texted me,

05:37.605 --> 05:38.606
never sent anything, never

05:38.606 --> 05:39.106
called.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.107
>> KRIS: I almost did, and then

05:40.107 --> 05:42.175
the Vanity Fa article, like,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.077
literally killed me.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.078
>> CAITLYN: About what?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.414
There's nothing in it!

05:46.414 --> 05:47.615
>> KRIS: Are you kidding?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.616
>> CAITLYN: I just think

05:48.616 --> 05:50.017
everybody is so overreacting...

05:50.017 --> 05:51.419
Talking about I was throwing you

05:51.419 --> 05:52.219
under the bus-- what did I say?

05:52.219 --> 05:52.820
>> KRIS: Everybody thought the

05:52.820 --> 05:53.754
same way-- okay... all right.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.422
Well, you're just not...

05:54.422 --> 05:55.423
>> CAITLYN: That was so

05:55.423 --> 05:57.425
terrible.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.433
>> KRIS: You're sensitive and

06:05.433 --> 06:07.535
amazing to all these new people

06:07.535 --> 06:08.702
in your life.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.471
You're just not so sensitive and

06:10.471 --> 06:12.773
amazing... to...

06:12.773 --> 06:14.442
this side of the family that you

06:14.442 --> 06:15.443
left behind.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.444
>> CAITLYN: Oh, come on!

06:16.444 --> 06:17.478
A phone call would have been

06:17.478 --> 06:20.280
great.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.615
Unbelievable.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.017
(tapping chair)

06:25.453 --> 06:26.654
>> KRIS: I was struggling and

06:26.654 --> 06:27.955
having a really hard time...

06:27.955 --> 06:31.024
>> CAITLYN: With what?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.793
>> KRIS: Your transition, and

06:32.793 --> 06:34.127
this, like, leaving us in the

06:34.127 --> 06:35.128
dust.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.129
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving you

06:36.129 --> 06:36.630
guys in the dust.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.631
>> KRIS: You left us, you left

06:37.631 --> 06:38.632
us in the dust.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.232
>> CAITLYN: Wh... Who?!

06:39.232 --> 06:40.233
>> KRIS: Basically, I'm just

06:40.233 --> 06:41.234
saying I went through a hard

06:41.234 --> 06:41.735
time.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.736
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving

06:42.736 --> 06:43.471
anybody... I'm not going

06:43.471 --> 06:44.472
anywhere.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.473
Nobody's leaving anybody in the

06:45.473 --> 06:45.939
dust.

06:45.939 --> 06:46.940
>> KRIS: Okay, but it does...

06:46.940 --> 06:47.941
Everybody handles it

06:47.941 --> 06:49.009
differently... you know?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.010
>> CAITLYN: Totally agree.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.011
>> KRIS: And I wasn't doing

06:51.011 --> 06:52.012
well.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.481
I mean, my feelings don't matter

06:53.481 --> 06:54.482
anymore-- it's not a part of...

06:54.482 --> 06:55.483
>> CAITLYN: Oh, don't play the

06:55.483 --> 06:55.949
martyr.

06:55.949 --> 06:56.950
>> KRIS: I'm not. I just don't.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.651
>> CAITLYN: Don't play the

06:57.651 --> 06:58.919
martyr-- don't feel "Oh, poor

06:58.919 --> 06:59.920
Kris, my feelings don't matter

06:59.920 --> 07:00.488
anymore."

07:00.488 --> 07:01.489
>> KRIS: I'm not "Oh, poor

07:01.489 --> 07:01.989
Kris."

07:01.989 --> 07:03.123
>> CAITLYN: That's BS.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.326
Obviously, they do.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.861
>> KRIS: Like, I'm trying to be

07:07.861 --> 07:10.498
understanding of the way that

07:10.498 --> 07:14.067
you feel and the way that you...

07:14.067 --> 07:15.503
made this huge change in your

07:15.503 --> 07:17.337
life, and I try to understand

07:17.337 --> 07:19.873
you and be accepting.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.776
But you just... are more

07:22.776 --> 07:25.312
stubborn and won't try to see

07:25.312 --> 07:27.414
my point of view in that.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.415
You know, why that was hurtful.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.283
>> CAITLYN: Well... I totally

07:30.283 --> 07:31.752
disagree with that.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.853
And I thought, honestly,

07:32.853 --> 07:33.854
I thought, because our

07:33.854 --> 07:35.122
relationship was not... I mean,

07:35.122 --> 07:36.890
our divorce was not based on,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.826
you know, horrible, horrible

07:38.826 --> 07:40.227
things-- we just, it wasn't

07:40.227 --> 07:41.394
working any longer and we both

07:41.394 --> 07:42.395
decided to go our separate

07:42.395 --> 07:43.997
directions-- that we would be

07:43.997 --> 07:46.166
able to... it would be easier to

07:46.166 --> 07:47.935
have a relationship later on

07:47.935 --> 07:48.936
down the line...

07:48.936 --> 07:49.937
>> KRIS: I thought so, too.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.104
>> CAITLYN: And it just has

07:51.104 --> 07:53.073
gone... whoosh!

07:53.073 --> 07:54.975
>> KRIS: But you are so happy

07:54.975 --> 07:57.110
and excited with your new life

07:57.110 --> 08:00.180
that-- which is amazing-- but

08:00.180 --> 08:03.617
some days, you know... some days

08:03.617 --> 08:06.554
are just... hard.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.888
And I know you say you haven't

08:07.888 --> 08:09.557
gone anywhere and you're still

08:09.557 --> 08:11.559
the same person, but sometimes

08:11.559 --> 08:14.628
they just miss having... Bruce

08:14.628 --> 08:16.296
around.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.265
We all do.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.904
>> CAITLYN: One of the most

08:23.904 --> 08:26.106
difficult things, uh, to deal

08:26.106 --> 08:28.408
with is that sense of grief that

08:28.408 --> 08:30.310
my family seems to be dealing

08:30.310 --> 08:32.846
with, about this transition.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.083
I wish that my happiness could

08:36.083 --> 08:37.885
be their happiness.

08:37.885 --> 08:41.388
The key is to have patience,

08:41.388 --> 08:43.591
keep love in your heart, stay

08:43.591 --> 08:45.492
committed to the goal.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.327
And I am really hopeful that

08:47.327 --> 08:50.731
Kris and I can do that.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.933
Lookit, we had great times.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.702
Let's not throw all that stuff

08:54.702 --> 08:56.403
out the door.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.605
(clears throat)

08:57.605 --> 08:58.939
How do we move forward from this

08:58.939 --> 09:01.675
point?

09:01.675 --> 09:02.710
>> KRIS: You know, obviously,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.144
it's really important for the

09:04.144 --> 09:06.714
kids to have you as a big part

09:06.714 --> 09:08.048
of their life.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.251
I think that we just have to get

09:11.251 --> 09:14.221
used to our new normal, and...

09:14.221 --> 09:15.222
>> CAITLYN: So are we gonna

09:15.222 --> 09:16.824
start hanging out together?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.225
>> KRIS: Sure.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.628
You can come over for a drink.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.695
>> CAITLYN: Go shopping?

09:21.695 --> 09:22.696
>> KRIS: Let's not get carried

09:22.696 --> 09:23.697
away.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.132
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.800
>> KRIS: I just want to get to a

09:26.800 --> 09:29.703
place where it's comfortable for

09:29.703 --> 09:32.039
us to-to share celebrations

09:32.039 --> 09:34.307
together.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.809
>> CAITLYN: That's great.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.510
Let's move on.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.112
It was good to talk, 'cause I

09:39.112 --> 09:40.714
got her side of the story.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.415
Um, I don't really agree with

09:42.415 --> 09:43.917
everything she said, but

09:43.917 --> 09:46.519
communication is always good.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.788
Maybe it'll be a little

09:47.788 --> 09:48.889
different in the future now.

09:48.889 --> 09:49.890
I hope it is.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.891
'Cause I want to keep my

09:50.891 --> 09:51.892
relationship with all my kids,

09:51.892 --> 09:52.893
and that's the most important

09:52.893 --> 09:53.894
thing.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.895
>> KRIS: So wait-- are you

09:54.895 --> 09:56.864
dating this girl called Candis?

09:56.864 --> 10:00.701
(Caitlyn laughs)

10:00.701 --> 10:02.803
>> KRIS: Mm... Okay.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.804
(chuckles)

10:03.804 --> 10:04.872
Oh, my God, you want to take

10:04.872 --> 10:05.939
a selfie?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.708
Come on.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.109
Where's the best light?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.377
>> CAITLYN: Right here.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.411
Hey, there we go.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.412
Now, what are you gonna do with

10:12.412 --> 10:13.781
this selfie?

10:13.781 --> 10:17.317
>> KRIS: No... (laughs)

10:17.317 --> 10:18.318
Okay.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.319
>> CAITLYN: You got lipstick all

10:19.319 --> 10:20.320
over your cheek.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.321
>> KRIS: That's all right.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.322
(Caitlyn laughs)

10:22.322 --> 10:24.057
>> KRIS: One of the things I

10:24.057 --> 10:25.926
always used to notice was that

10:25.926 --> 10:27.995
Bruce wasn't as sensitive as I

10:27.995 --> 10:30.563
wished he was, but I think I

10:30.563 --> 10:32.465
just used to chalk it up to the

10:32.465 --> 10:34.334
fact that, you know, he was a

10:34.334 --> 10:36.670
guy... but I'm kind of realizing

10:36.670 --> 10:38.405
now that maybe that's just

10:38.405 --> 10:39.673
Bruce-slash-Caitlyn's

10:39.673 --> 10:41.441
personality-- both of them,

10:41.441 --> 10:42.810
if you will.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.877
You know, it's the, it's just...

10:43.877 --> 10:46.179
it's just the way she is.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.580
I think that we just

10:47.580 --> 10:49.182
have to continue to communicate

10:49.182 --> 10:50.650
with each other, so we can keep

10:50.650 --> 10:52.519
our family together.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.722
'Cause that's the most important

10:54.722 --> 10:56.389
thing, I think, to both of us.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.590
All right, well, see you later.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.658
Bye, don't get makeup on my

10:58.658 --> 10:59.526
jacket, okay?

10:59.526 --> 11:00.127
>> CAITLYN: I won't.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.194
>> KRIS: It's a little trick.

11:01.194 --> 11:01.729
Okay.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.730
>> CAITLYN: I know-I know how to

11:02.730 --> 11:03.196
do that.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.197
>> KRIS: All right.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.632
See you later.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.600
>> CAITLYN: Bye.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.044
>> CANDIS: Mmm...

11:17.044 --> 11:18.578
>> CAITLYN: That looks good.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.180
>> CANDIS: Yummy.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
>> CAITLYN: Guess what happened

11:21.181 --> 11:22.182
yesterday.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.984
>> CANDIS: What?

11:23.984 --> 11:26.086
>> CAITLYN: Kris was over.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.221
>> CANDIS: Was it a tense talk?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.090
Did it get heated?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.091
>> CAITLYN: A hard talk.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.492
I wouldn't call it tense.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.593
>> CANDIS: Okay.

11:33.593 --> 11:34.895
>> CAITLYN: We just opened up

11:34.895 --> 11:36.129
communication.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.765
We were not communicating at all

11:37.765 --> 11:38.966
for the longest time.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.333
>> CANDIS: Right, well, you had

11:40.333 --> 11:42.102
other things on your mind.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.103
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.104
>> CANDIS: Well, it sounds like

11:44.104 --> 11:45.105
it was a good thing.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.106
>> CAITLYN: It was good.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.841
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

11:47.841 --> 11:48.942
So...

11:48.942 --> 11:50.110
>> CAITLYN: Name change-- did

11:50.110 --> 11:51.779
you celebrate when you finally

11:51.779 --> 11:53.914
got your name changed?

11:53.914 --> 11:54.915
>> CANDIS: No.

11:54.915 --> 11:55.916
>> CAITLYN: I've realized that

11:55.916 --> 11:57.785
my transition in my life should

11:57.785 --> 12:00.453
be celebrated, and I've decided

12:00.453 --> 12:02.122
to have a renaming ceremony.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.123
You know, it's almost like a

12:03.123 --> 12:04.491
rebirth-- this is a whole new

12:04.491 --> 12:05.592
you that's coming out and

12:05.592 --> 12:06.593
presenting yourself to the

12:06.593 --> 12:07.594
world.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.595
>> CANDIS: I wish I had made

12:08.595 --> 12:10.430
more of a... like, a...

12:10.430 --> 12:11.431
>> CAITLYN: A big deal about it.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.100
>> CANDIS: A big deal about it.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.134
Are you excited?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.135
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I am excited

12:15.135 --> 12:16.503
for the ceremony.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.871
>> CANDIS: It'll inspire more

12:17.871 --> 12:19.807
girls to have celebrations.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.808
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it's kind of

12:20.808 --> 12:21.909
like, not just a celebration for

12:21.909 --> 12:23.210
me, but for everybody who... all

12:23.210 --> 12:24.211
the girls who didn't have the

12:24.211 --> 12:25.212
opportunity to do that.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.213
>> CANDIS: Right.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.214
>> CAITLYN: In talking with all

12:27.214 --> 12:28.816
the girls, it's amazing to me

12:28.816 --> 12:30.150
that they never really celebrate

12:30.150 --> 12:31.384
their name change.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.585
Most of 'em just got their new

12:32.585 --> 12:34.554
driver's license, new name, new

12:34.554 --> 12:36.623
gender marker, and kind of just

12:36.623 --> 12:38.458
went on with life.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.493
Why shouldn't it be celebrated?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.495
I would like for you to sing.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.697
>> CANDIS: Sing?

12:44.697 --> 12:45.698
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I've heard you

12:45.698 --> 12:46.699
sing.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.101
You actually sound very, very,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.536
very good.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.838
>> CANDIS: Well, thank you, but

12:50.838 --> 12:52.840
I don't know-- my-my nerves go.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.841
I get so wrecked before I have

12:53.841 --> 12:54.842
to sing live.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.209
It's kind of crazy.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.377
I... Maybe it's just because...

12:57.377 --> 12:58.378
>> CAITLYN: Well then, in that

12:58.378 --> 12:59.379
case, you have to do it.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.014
You got to step out there.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.315
Yeah.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.584
Yeah.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.585
>> CANDIS: I need to get through

13:05.585 --> 13:07.554
it, so I will sing.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.431
>> CAITLYN: * Ta-da!

13:18.431 --> 13:19.432
We're here.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.167
>> JENNY: Hi, sweetie pie.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.168
>> CAITLYN: I guess I'm at the

13:21.168 --> 13:21.668
head of the table?

13:21.668 --> 13:22.669
Does that mean I pick up the

13:22.669 --> 13:23.670
check?

13:23.670 --> 13:24.171
>> JENNY: Yes.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.172
>> DRIAN: Yes.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.706
>> CAITLYN: Okay, okay.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.942
I will, I will.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.610
Tell me a little bit about...

13:30.610 --> 13:32.312
our other dinner guest.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.447
Faith, in my case, has been

13:34.447 --> 13:35.715
really important in going

13:35.715 --> 13:36.716
through this process.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.351
And I asked Jenny Boylan if she

13:38.351 --> 13:41.721
has a minister that would be

13:41.721 --> 13:42.722
interested in performing

13:42.722 --> 13:44.024
a religious ceremony.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.025
And, of course, Jenny not only

13:45.025 --> 13:46.193
knows a minister, she knows a

13:46.193 --> 13:48.261
trans minister.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.130
So I'm very excited about this.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.132
>> JENNY: Ms. Allyson Robinson.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.400
She has done a lot of

13:53.400 --> 13:54.401
interesting things.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.402
She went to West Point, first

13:55.402 --> 13:56.403
off.

13:56.403 --> 13:56.904
>> DRIAN: Wow. Neat.

13:56.904 --> 13:57.905
>> CAITLYN: Oh, really?

13:57.905 --> 13:59.072
>> JENNY: Um, yeah, and so she

13:59.072 --> 14:00.107
was headed for a career in the

14:00.107 --> 14:01.174
military.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.477
And then she felt a calling.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.678
So she went to seminary.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.780
And she became a minister in the

14:07.780 --> 14:09.082
Baptist church.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.350
>> CAITLYN: Question: was she

14:10.350 --> 14:11.985
not transitioned at that point?

14:11.985 --> 14:12.986
>> JENNY: She was not

14:12.986 --> 14:13.987
transitioned at that point and I

14:13.987 --> 14:16.189
believe she was married.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.657
I like the fact that she's a

14:17.657 --> 14:18.992
person of faith.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.260
I think that there's a sense

14:20.260 --> 14:21.929
that-that transgender people...

14:21.929 --> 14:22.930
>> DRIAN: Religion and trans

14:22.930 --> 14:23.931
don't go together.

14:23.931 --> 14:24.932
>> JENNY: Well, that-that, well,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.599
that... if you're trans, that

14:26.599 --> 14:27.935
somehow... that somehow you're-

14:27.935 --> 14:29.136
you're godless.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.938
And in fact, most of the trans

14:30.938 --> 14:32.439
people I know are very

14:32.439 --> 14:33.806
spiritual.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.108
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.109
>> JENNY: Here comes Reverend

14:36.109 --> 14:37.110
Robinson.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.111
>> ALLYSON: Hello, everyone.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.112
>> CAITLYN: There we are.

14:39.112 --> 14:39.612
>> DRIAN: Hi.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.613
>> ALLYSON: Hi.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.114
>> DRIAN: Drian.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.115
>> CAITLYN: It's so nice to meet

14:42.115 --> 14:42.615
you, how are you?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.616
>> ALLYSON: It is so wonderful

14:43.616 --> 14:44.784
to meet you-- I'm great, thank

14:44.784 --> 14:45.818
you for having me.

14:45.818 --> 14:46.819
>> JENNY: I was just singing

14:46.819 --> 14:47.320
your praises.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.321
>> ALLYSON: Oh, were you?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.456
>> JENNY: And reciting your bio.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.457
You'll be interested to know I

14:50.457 --> 14:51.458
made up all kinds of stuff.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.225
>> ALLYSON: Oh, I'm so glad.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.226
>> JENNY: Your time in the

14:53.226 --> 14:53.860
circus with the elephants.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.861
>> ALLYSON: Yes, right, of

14:54.861 --> 14:55.362
course.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.363
>> JENNY: Your time in the

14:56.363 --> 14:57.364
French Foreign Legion.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.365
>> DEEDIE: You know, just

14:58.365 --> 14:59.466
because it didn't happen doesn't

14:59.466 --> 15:00.968
mean Jenny can't remember it.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.403
>> ALLYSON: Oh, yeah, of course.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
>> CAITLYN: How does this going

15:04.404 --> 15:05.638
to work-- am I gonna survive?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.007
Am I gonna be okay?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.441
>> ALLYSON: I think so.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.177
We're gonna mark a moment.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.146
Uh, this is what so many of our

15:13.146 --> 15:14.647
religious rights and ceremonies

15:14.647 --> 15:16.049
are about anyway, and so we're

15:16.049 --> 15:17.050
going to acknowledge the

15:17.050 --> 15:18.051
journey.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.886
We're going to ask you...

15:19.886 --> 15:20.887
what shall your name be?

15:20.887 --> 15:21.888
>> JENNY: You're sticking with

15:21.888 --> 15:22.889
Caitlyn, though, right?

15:22.889 --> 15:23.590
You're not gonna, like...

15:23.590 --> 15:24.591
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not gonna

15:24.591 --> 15:25.592
change it, yeah.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.994
Becky-- we're not going with

15:26.994 --> 15:28.895
Becky.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.197
>> DRIAN: I wish I had done

15:30.197 --> 15:32.365
a renaming ceremony.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.434
You know, for me... it was

15:34.434 --> 15:36.303
a very lonely process.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.171
I never celebrated it.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.240
I never got to share that with

15:40.240 --> 15:42.009
family and friends.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.311
I was brought up Catholic.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.478
And I had to go to Sunday

15:45.478 --> 15:46.479
school.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.881
And the kids there were just so

15:48.881 --> 15:50.783
mean.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.085
To this day, I'm really, I-I

15:52.085 --> 15:53.453
feel I'm still in that process

15:53.453 --> 15:54.721
of healing that.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.789
>> ALLYSON: Absolutely.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.025
>> CAITLYN: I believe in the

15:58.025 --> 16:00.727
Bible, I believe in God.

16:00.727 --> 16:01.928
But over the last couple of

16:01.928 --> 16:03.930
months, I have gotten quite a

16:03.930 --> 16:06.799
few letters from people of faith

16:06.799 --> 16:09.502
who say, "You can't do this.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.638
God says you were born this way,

16:11.638 --> 16:12.639
you got to stay this way."

16:12.639 --> 16:13.640
>> ALLYSON: Right.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.841
>> ESTHER: And I'm sure you've

16:14.841 --> 16:17.044
read the passage in the Bible.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.445
If you're a man and you dress

16:18.445 --> 16:20.813
like a woman, you know...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.482
Do you have any, uh,

16:22.482 --> 16:25.052
interpretation of that?

16:25.052 --> 16:27.120
>> CAITLYN: How, in your mind,

16:27.120 --> 16:31.058
did you justify transitioning?

16:31.058 --> 16:33.060
>> DRIAN: Good question.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.061
>> ALLYSON: It's a great

16:34.061 --> 16:35.195
question.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.229
Yeah, well, I mean, the first

16:36.229 --> 16:38.298
thing I would say is welcome to

16:38.298 --> 16:39.299
the... welcome to the club.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.300
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.501
>> ALLYSON: You know, you join

16:41.501 --> 16:44.404
a... a long line of people like

16:44.404 --> 16:47.174
us, who have, uh, been on the

16:47.174 --> 16:48.441
receiving end of that kind of

16:48.441 --> 16:50.910
hostility and condemnation.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.948
>> ALLYSON: You-you join a...

16:55.948 --> 16:57.850
a-a long line of people like us

16:57.850 --> 16:59.786
who have been on the receiving

16:59.786 --> 17:01.388
end of hostility and

17:01.388 --> 17:03.356
condemnation.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.430
Uh, I wear it as a badge of

17:10.430 --> 17:11.598
honor.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.101
I mean, I-I really believe that

17:14.101 --> 17:16.436
my faith is deeper today because

17:16.436 --> 17:17.704
it's been challenged.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.006
I-I'm a Baptist-- we take

17:20.006 --> 17:22.008
Biblical text very seriously,

17:22.008 --> 17:23.343
and I had to ask some hard

17:23.343 --> 17:25.011
questions of the text.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.214
You know, what about that, uh,

17:27.214 --> 17:28.815
verse that talks about men not

17:28.815 --> 17:30.150
wearing women's clothes, right?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.151
>> CAITLYN: My mother brings

17:31.151 --> 17:31.651
that subject up.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.652
How do... how do you answer

17:32.652 --> 17:33.153
that?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.154
>> ALLYSON: It's worth... it's

17:34.154 --> 17:35.488
worth asking.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.489
One of the things that I was

17:36.489 --> 17:38.024
taught was to interpret the text

17:38.024 --> 17:40.227
in the broader context of

17:40.227 --> 17:41.861
history, of culture.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.996
You'll find verses that forbid

17:43.996 --> 17:45.698
the weaving together of clothes

17:45.698 --> 17:46.999
from two different kinds of

17:46.999 --> 17:50.603
cloth or-or even touching a pig.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.139
So if you've ever touched a

17:52.139 --> 17:53.406
football, like you and I both

17:53.406 --> 17:55.942
have, we're... we're condemned

17:55.942 --> 17:57.710
in the exact same way.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.312
And so I would view that text as

17:59.312 --> 18:01.514
just one of hundreds of

18:01.514 --> 18:04.717
intricate rules that God brought

18:04.717 --> 18:06.786
to a close, uh, with-with the

18:06.786 --> 18:07.787
coming of God's son into the

18:07.787 --> 18:08.788
world.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.622
>> CAITLYN: That's a good way to

18:09.622 --> 18:10.290
think about it.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.158
>> JENNY: That's really well

18:11.158 --> 18:11.758
said.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.559
>> ALLYSON: Old and New

18:12.559 --> 18:13.693
Testaments are full of

18:13.693 --> 18:15.928
characters who have nothing to

18:15.928 --> 18:17.497
do with their society's gender

18:17.497 --> 18:18.831
rules, right?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.733
They-they thumb their nose at-at

18:20.733 --> 18:23.236
society's rules about gender.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.804
Joseph with the-the coat of many

18:24.804 --> 18:25.805
colors.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.174
You know, the Hebrew word for

18:27.174 --> 18:28.475
that coat of many colors is

18:28.475 --> 18:29.709
"a princess dress."

18:29.709 --> 18:31.611
Joseph's father gave Joseph a

18:31.611 --> 18:33.246
princess dress.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.348
Um, knowing that our stories

18:35.348 --> 18:37.717
have always been there has-has

18:37.717 --> 18:39.286
helped me to keep those two

18:39.286 --> 18:41.254
worlds intact.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.556
But I-I think that the most

18:43.556 --> 18:45.992
radical idea is that God doesn't

18:45.992 --> 18:48.295
love us in spite of who we are--

18:48.295 --> 18:49.362
God loves us because of who we

18:49.362 --> 18:50.530
are.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.664
>> JENNY: Well, it was his idea.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.765
>> ALLYSON: Yeah.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.967
Right. Exactly.

18:54.967 --> 18:55.968
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.404
>> DRIAN: God, I wish, as a kid,

18:57.404 --> 18:58.938
I could've connected with

18:58.938 --> 19:00.307
a positive church.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.209
I think I would probably still

19:02.209 --> 19:05.111
be connected to God, to, you

19:05.111 --> 19:07.079
know, my faith.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.316
And, you know, for kids that are

19:09.316 --> 19:11.083
hearing these messages, there

19:11.083 --> 19:12.652
are communities out there that

19:12.652 --> 19:14.221
will embrace you, because you're

19:14.221 --> 19:16.623
perfect as who you are.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.659
God makes no mistakes.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.660
Well, cheers to crossroads.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.662
>> ALLYSON: Yes, to crossroads.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.996
>> JENNY: Crossroads. Well said.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.132
>> DEEDIE: Sharing the journey.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.100
(birds chirping)

19:30.903 --> 19:31.904
>> MAN: Box? Box?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.139
>> MAN 2: Box? Sorry, yeah.

19:33.139 --> 19:37.009
(truck beeping)

19:37.009 --> 19:38.645
>> LORI: 30 minutes, guys.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.112
30 minutes till the eagle lands.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.748
>> CANDIS: I think it's great

19:41.748 --> 19:43.082
that Cait has a team of

19:43.082 --> 19:44.784
designers coming over to change

19:44.784 --> 19:46.686
her surroundings to fit who she

19:46.686 --> 19:48.321
is as a person and not something

19:48.321 --> 19:51.057
one of her ex-wives picked out.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.359
(chuckles)

19:52.359 --> 19:53.760
>> LORI: Um, the long 12-foot

19:53.760 --> 19:55.962
sofa that's labeled "Homenature"

19:55.962 --> 19:57.497
is going in the living room.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.765
She's coming home.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.733
Hurry.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.237
>> CAITLYN: How you doing, babe?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.272
>> CANDIS: Good.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.339
>> CAITLYN: I love it when you

20:06.339 --> 20:07.840
wear the heels and I got flats.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.975
You know, it's kind of fun to

20:08.975 --> 20:10.042
just kind of discover who you

20:10.042 --> 20:11.244
are.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.512
I mean, a simple thing as

20:12.512 --> 20:13.680
decorating.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.081
I-I think I will kind of acquire

20:15.081 --> 20:16.082
my taste.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.083
All right, let's go check it

20:17.083 --> 20:18.084
out!

20:18.084 --> 20:19.085
>> CANDIS: My God, this is so

20:19.085 --> 20:20.086
exciting.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.290
>> CAITLYN: I know.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.557
>> JOE: We're gonna be, uh,

20:24.557 --> 20:26.726
joined by Boy George.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.794
>> MAN: Oh, my God!

20:27.794 --> 20:28.795
(laughter)

20:28.795 --> 20:29.996
>> CANDIS: Seeing Boy George is

20:29.996 --> 20:31.898
making my heart skip a beat.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.032
Then having to sing in front of

20:33.032 --> 20:35.502
him at the renaming ceremony,

20:35.502 --> 20:37.069
oh, my God.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.104
>> MIMI: Is this your first time

20:38.104 --> 20:39.105
singin' this song?

20:39.105 --> 20:40.707
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.209
>> ALLYSON: And so here we are,

20:43.209 --> 20:46.446
daughter of God.

20:46.446 --> 20:50.149
What shall your name be called?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.823
(Caitlyn humming)

20:56.823 --> 20:58.024
>> CAITLYN: Uh-oh!

20:58.024 --> 20:59.258
>> LORI: Hello, ladies!

20:59.258 --> 21:00.327
>> CAITLYN: I'm back.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.661
>> LORI: Beautiful. Hello.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.662
>> CAITLYN: Thank you, babe.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.663
>> LORI: Welcome to your new

21:03.663 --> 21:05.332
home.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.866
>> CAITLYN: Let's check it out.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.000
We'll go slow.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.201
>> LORI: Go slow.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.770
You might not recognize it.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.871
>> CAITLYN: Ooh...

21:11.871 --> 21:13.005
That looks so good.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.140
>> CANDIS: Wow.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.141
>> CAITLYN: Love the pillows,

21:15.141 --> 21:16.142
love the couch.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.610
>> LORI: It's from Homenature.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.611
>> CANDIS: Don't you love the

21:18.611 --> 21:19.612
Lindsey Adelman chandelier?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.880
>> CAITLYN: I know. Rocking it!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.148
I love it.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.550
I think what this whole

21:23.550 --> 21:24.951
transition has done for me,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.486
for the first time in my life,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.254
I'm able to express myself.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.889
>> CANDIS: It's lighter, airy.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.090
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, feminine.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.091
I like that.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.393
So many people are coming over

21:33.393 --> 21:34.761
to the house for the ceremony,

21:34.761 --> 21:36.829
and I am so excited to show 'em

21:36.829 --> 21:38.465
the final results.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.466
Thank you for all your hard

21:39.466 --> 21:40.467
work.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.801
>> LORI: You're so welcome.

21:41.801 --> 21:45.572
(birds chirping)

21:45.572 --> 21:47.039
(laughter)

21:47.039 --> 21:49.376
>> DRIAN: So we're going in?

21:49.376 --> 21:50.377
>> JENNY: Yeah, we're gonna go.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.778
Back of the bus again.

21:51.778 --> 21:52.779
>> DRIAN: Again to the back of

21:52.779 --> 21:53.780
the bus.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.782
Oh, there's a pole here?

21:55.782 --> 21:57.116
>> CAITLYN: Jenny Boylan on the

21:57.116 --> 21:58.485
pole!

21:58.485 --> 21:59.619
Come on, baby!

21:59.619 --> 22:01.654
(whooping, cheering)

22:04.290 --> 22:06.158
>> CHANDI: Yay!

22:06.158 --> 22:07.494
>> CAITLYN: I've been asked to

22:07.494 --> 22:08.561
introduce Boy George at his

22:08.561 --> 22:10.062
concert at the Greek Theatre, so

22:10.062 --> 22:11.063
I invited all the girls to join

22:11.063 --> 22:12.098
me.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.232
Now, that's gonna be fun.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.233
Boy George concert, yeah!

22:14.233 --> 22:16.436
(whooping)

22:16.436 --> 22:18.538
(all cheering)

22:18.538 --> 22:19.806
>> CAITLYN: Oh, how we doing?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.208
>> WOMAN: Caitlyn!

22:22.208 --> 22:23.410
>> CANDIS: (chuckles) I love it

22:23.410 --> 22:24.577
more than anything, because it's

22:24.577 --> 22:25.845
a trans woman that people are

22:25.845 --> 22:28.981
going crazy over.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.717
>> CAITLYN: I wouldn't expect

22:30.717 --> 22:31.718
anything less.

22:31.718 --> 22:32.719
>> COURTNEY: You guys...

22:32.719 --> 22:33.720
>> BOY GEORGE: There's more,

22:33.720 --> 22:34.721
there's more, there's more.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.922
There's bigger hats,

22:35.922 --> 22:36.923
entire business.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.657
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for asking

22:37.657 --> 22:38.324
me to introduce you.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.125
>> BOY GEORGE: I think you're

22:39.125 --> 22:39.859
gonna get a standing ovation.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.860
I'd be very surprised if they

22:40.860 --> 22:41.861
don't stand up, and I'll be very

22:41.861 --> 22:42.662
disappointed if they don't.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.430
>> CAITLYN: Well, I know.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.464
Uh, just coming in, I think

22:44.464 --> 22:45.465
we're okay.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.033
Just coming in.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.901
>> BOY GEORGE: Oh, hey!

22:48.901 --> 22:50.302
(overlapping chatter)

22:50.302 --> 22:51.604
>> CAITLYN: Nice to see you.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.839
>> BOY GEORGE: I'm just gonna

22:52.839 --> 22:54.707
expect you to always be...

22:54.707 --> 22:56.576
(overlapping chatter)

22:56.576 --> 22:57.577
>> CAITLYN: I remember you back

22:57.577 --> 23:00.346
in the '80s, and I had obviously

23:00.346 --> 23:02.014
all my issues and this and that.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.450
And obviously I followed you.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.851
And I'm so glad to see you back

23:04.851 --> 23:05.918
and be here tonight to celebrate

23:05.918 --> 23:06.919
that.

23:06.919 --> 23:07.920
>> BOY GEORGE: Do you know what

23:07.920 --> 23:09.055
it is is I think that you...

23:09.055 --> 23:10.122
you're getting a little bit

23:10.122 --> 23:11.190
older, you-you kind of operate

23:11.190 --> 23:12.191
from a different level of

23:12.191 --> 23:13.192
consciousness.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.193
>> CAITLYN: Absolutely, yeah.

23:14.193 --> 23:14.861
>> BOY GEORGE: You know, you

23:14.861 --> 23:15.928
have this wonderful opportunity

23:15.928 --> 23:17.063
to do so much good.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.465
When I was 19, I was so full of

23:18.465 --> 23:19.899
my own self-importance.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.568
I can't say that I was leading

23:21.568 --> 23:23.169
a political thing.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.170
It was just me being myself,

23:24.170 --> 23:25.171
which in itself was quite

23:25.171 --> 23:26.038
powerful.

23:26.038 --> 23:26.973
>> CAITLYN: That's the same way

23:26.973 --> 23:27.707
I got.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.475
>> BOY GEORGE: It might have

23:28.475 --> 23:29.476
been blind kind of

23:29.476 --> 23:30.477
self-importance, but it had a

23:30.477 --> 23:32.745
massive effect, you know, and

23:32.745 --> 23:34.481
I'm only really enjoying that

23:34.481 --> 23:35.482
now, 'cause I'm sober and I'm

23:35.482 --> 23:36.115
sensible.

23:36.115 --> 23:36.916
>> CAITLYN: How lucky we are.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.650
>> BOY GEORGE: Yeah, absolutely.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.485
>> CAITLYN: I'm the same way.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.652
>> JENNY: We remember, when you

23:39.652 --> 23:41.921
first came out... had that first

23:41.921 --> 23:43.355
hit, that we were all... that it

23:43.355 --> 23:44.123
was such a huge thing for us,

23:44.123 --> 23:44.724
that there's someone visible.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.725
>> ZACKARY: Oh, yeah, you were

23:45.725 --> 23:46.493
the only person I ever knew of.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.293
>> CAITLYN: George, we need a

23:47.293 --> 23:48.294
picture with all the girls.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.295
>> DRIAN: A picture, please.

23:49.295 --> 23:49.929
>> CAITLYN: Come in here in the

23:49.929 --> 23:50.597
middle.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.931
George, come over here.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.965
>> BOY GEORGE: This is a cosmic

23:52.965 --> 23:54.066
moment.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.602
(others agreeing)

23:55.602 --> 23:56.603
(overlapping chatter)

23:56.603 --> 23:57.604
>> CAITLYN: We got to go.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.605
Good luck.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.606
I will see you onstage!

23:59.606 --> 24:01.273
I get to introduce you!

24:01.273 --> 24:02.842
It'll be fun.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.944
(audience cheering)

24:04.944 --> 24:05.945
>> CAITLYN: Do we go that way?

24:05.945 --> 24:06.946
>> BOY GEORGE: PK, who's looking

24:06.946 --> 24:07.947
after Caitlyn?

24:07.947 --> 24:08.948
>> PK: Go get 'em, Caitlyn.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.949
>> CAITLYN: Go get 'em?

24:09.949 --> 24:10.950
>> PK: Go get 'em.

24:10.950 --> 24:11.951
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Are you ready?

24:11.951 --> 24:12.952
Let's do this.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.888
(audience cheering)

24:15.888 --> 24:17.824
>> CAITLYN: Thank you!

24:17.824 --> 24:20.593
>> CROWD: Caitlyn! Caitlyn!

24:20.593 --> 24:21.761
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn Jenner in

24:21.761 --> 24:23.530
the house for her first Boy

24:23.530 --> 24:25.532
George concert!

24:25.532 --> 24:26.899
(audience cheering)

24:26.899 --> 24:28.868
Let's hear it here at the Greek

24:28.868 --> 24:30.302
Theatre for Boy George!

24:30.302 --> 24:31.704
Let's hear it for him!

24:31.704 --> 24:34.173
(cheering)

24:34.173 --> 24:36.142
*

24:44.684 --> 24:46.653
(birds chirping)

24:49.956 --> 24:50.957
>> JOE: Could you give us an

24:50.957 --> 24:51.958
"F"?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.159
(pianist plays "F")

24:53.159 --> 24:55.862
(chorus humming)

24:55.862 --> 24:58.330
Hello! Welcome! Good to see you.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.331
I don't know if you all know

24:59.331 --> 25:00.466
Candis Cayne.

25:00.466 --> 25:01.801
>> CANDIS: How are you?

25:01.801 --> 25:02.802
(chuckles)

25:02.802 --> 25:03.870
I want to do something special

25:03.870 --> 25:06.038
for Cait and sing at the

25:06.038 --> 25:08.575
renaming ceremony.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.442
So I asked the Gay Men's Chorus

25:10.442 --> 25:12.612
to back me up.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.613
>> JOE: Let's take a look at

25:13.613 --> 25:14.614
"Amazing Grace."

25:14.614 --> 25:15.882
(piano playing first notes)

25:15.882 --> 25:17.449
>> JOE: Now, what key works for

25:17.449 --> 25:18.450
you, as far as... Do you know

25:18.450 --> 25:19.451
what's-what's comfortable for

25:19.451 --> 25:20.452
you?

25:20.452 --> 25:21.453
>> CANDIS: Not the...

25:21.453 --> 25:22.454
(deep): * Ama...

25:22.454 --> 25:23.455
>> JOE: Okay. How-how 'bout...

25:23.455 --> 25:25.391
how 'bout... how 'bout E-flat,

25:25.391 --> 25:26.425
B-flat?

25:26.425 --> 25:27.426
(pianist plays higher notes)

25:27.426 --> 25:31.130
* Amazing grace

25:31.130 --> 25:32.298
>> BOTH: * How sweet

25:32.298 --> 25:34.667
>> CANDIS: * The sound

25:34.667 --> 25:35.668
>> JOE: Good. Let's do this.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.236
Harmonize on a hum and she'll

25:37.236 --> 25:38.237
sing the words.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.238
One more time, let's do the

25:39.238 --> 25:40.506
first verse.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.507
>> CANDIS: I've always been so

25:41.507 --> 25:43.009
confident in my acting and my

25:43.009 --> 25:44.777
dancing, and, as a singer, I'm

25:44.777 --> 25:47.446
not as confident.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.415
* I see...

25:49.415 --> 25:51.383
(chorus humming)

25:56.623 --> 25:58.157
It's hard to sing out of your

25:58.157 --> 25:59.158
key, you know what I mean?

25:59.158 --> 26:00.159
>> JOE: Absolutely. And this...

26:00.159 --> 26:01.160
Yeah, this is... this was

26:01.160 --> 26:02.228
arranged for us, and-and...

26:02.228 --> 26:03.229
>> CANDIS: Exactly.

26:03.229 --> 26:03.896
>> JOE: That's okay.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.697
>> CANDIS: I'm just gonna get

26:04.697 --> 26:05.297
some water real quick.

26:05.297 --> 26:05.798
>> JOE: Oh, yeah.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.800
Absolutely, absolutely.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.935
>> CANDIS: I was just nervous

26:08.935 --> 26:10.169
'cause I don't have the... like,

26:10.169 --> 26:11.370
I don't have the, um... the

26:11.370 --> 26:12.538
right key.

26:12.538 --> 26:13.640
Like, it's too low and then too

26:13.640 --> 26:14.641
high.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.808
>> MIMI: It sounded so good,

26:15.808 --> 26:17.677
Candis.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.945
It sounds gorgeous.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.346
>> CANDIS: Okay, good.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.347
>> MIMI: Don't be nervous.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.414
>> JOE: So, in a few minutes,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.016
we're gonna be, uh, joined by

26:24.016 --> 26:25.317
Boy George.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.385
>> MAN: Oh, my God!

26:26.385 --> 26:28.955
(laughter)

26:28.955 --> 26:30.690
I love Boy George.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.891
(whimpers)

26:31.891 --> 26:33.259
(laughter)

26:33.259 --> 26:34.661
(laughter)

26:34.661 --> 26:35.662
>> CANDIS: As long as I can

26:35.662 --> 26:37.396
remember, Boy George has been a

26:37.396 --> 26:40.933
pivotal person in the LGBT

26:40.933 --> 26:42.769
community, so I reached out to

26:42.769 --> 26:45.037
him to sing at the renaming

26:45.037 --> 26:46.739
ceremony.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.775
I think he's the perfect person

26:48.775 --> 26:51.243
who would add life and love to

26:51.243 --> 26:52.879
this amazing celebration.

26:52.879 --> 26:53.880
>> JOE: What we thought about

26:53.880 --> 26:55.682
doing-- uh, you handle verse

26:55.682 --> 26:56.816
one, verse two... then the

26:56.816 --> 26:57.817
chorus comes in on the chorus

26:57.817 --> 26:58.818
chorus as soon as...

26:58.818 --> 26:59.952
>> BOY GEORGE: It might be nice,

26:59.952 --> 27:01.320
at the end, to do, like, a verse

27:01.320 --> 27:02.554
together, you know.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.856
I mean, you're here.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.192
(men laughing)

27:06.192 --> 27:07.193
>> JOE: So, chorus...

27:07.193 --> 27:08.828
>> GUITARIST: A-one, two...

27:08.828 --> 27:09.896
>> BOY GEORGE: * If there's a

27:09.896 --> 27:11.864
God

27:11.864 --> 27:12.865
Surely he wants me to be... *

27:12.865 --> 27:13.866
But you should maybe "ooh" on

27:13.866 --> 27:14.867
that.

27:14.867 --> 27:15.868
>> MAN: Oh.

27:15.868 --> 27:16.869
>> BOY GEORGE: So...

27:16.869 --> 27:18.705
>> CHORUS: * If there's a God

27:18.705 --> 27:19.839
Ooh... Ooh... *

27:19.839 --> 27:20.840
>> BOY GEORGE: * Surely

27:20.840 --> 27:23.943
He wants me to be myself *

27:23.943 --> 27:28.080
>> CHORUS: * If there's a God

27:28.080 --> 27:29.716
If there's a God... *

27:29.716 --> 27:30.717
>> BOY GEORGE: Feel like you

27:30.717 --> 27:31.718
wanted to do something over the

27:31.718 --> 27:32.719
end there.

27:32.719 --> 27:33.720
I don't think it's gonna go...

27:33.720 --> 27:34.721
>> MAN: No!

27:34.721 --> 27:35.722
>> BOY GEORGE: No?

27:35.722 --> 27:36.723
You didn't want to do that?

27:36.723 --> 27:37.724
You know, like, sometimes you

27:37.724 --> 27:38.490
just go, "Where the (bleep) did

27:38.490 --> 27:39.491
that come from?"

27:39.491 --> 27:40.426
>> MAN: That's right here.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.427
>> BOY GEORGE: Which one's that?

27:41.427 --> 27:42.428
>> MAN: Right here.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.462
>> BOY GEORGE: Okay, I like a

27:43.462 --> 27:44.463
bit of that.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.464
>> MAN 2: Cool. Cool.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.298
>> BOY GEORGE: One little bit of

27:46.298 --> 27:47.299
advice.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.300
>> MAN: Yeah?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.135
>> BOY GEORGE: You got to, you

27:49.135 --> 27:49.969
know, sing it about what it

27:49.969 --> 27:50.970
means, and if you own it, it's

27:50.970 --> 27:51.804
just gonna make such a

27:51.804 --> 27:52.638
difference, you know.

27:52.638 --> 27:53.639
>> GUITARIST: One, a-two...

27:53.639 --> 27:54.640
>> BOY GEORGE: * If there's

27:54.640 --> 27:58.144
A God I want him to be... *

27:58.144 --> 27:59.746
>> CANDIS: Seeing Boy George is

27:59.746 --> 28:01.580
kind of making my heart skip a

28:01.580 --> 28:02.749
beat.

28:02.749 --> 28:03.983
This is one of those people that

28:03.983 --> 28:05.651
I looked up to as a kid.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.386
And having to sing in front of

28:07.386 --> 28:09.555
him at the renaming ceremony--

28:09.555 --> 28:12.524
Oh, my God, what was I thinking?

28:12.524 --> 28:17.296
(chorus sings closing note)

28:18.765 --> 28:22.001
(birds squawking and singing)

28:27.006 --> 28:29.308
(indistinct conversations)

28:29.308 --> 28:30.142
>> CAITLYN: Let's see what's...

28:30.142 --> 28:30.977
>> RONDA: You not allowed out...

28:30.977 --> 28:31.811
>> CAITLYN: I'm trying to think

28:31.811 --> 28:32.812
of what's going on.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.612
>> RONDA: You know you're not

28:33.612 --> 28:34.613
allowed out there, right?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.548
>> CAITLYN: Okay, here I am back

28:36.548 --> 28:37.549
in my closet.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.550
Why? 'Cause they don't even

28:38.550 --> 28:40.352
allow me out into the house.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.988
(sighs)

28:41.988 --> 28:43.790
Outside right now, they are

28:43.790 --> 28:46.793
setting up for my name change.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.160
All the girls, all my little

28:48.160 --> 28:50.096
tribe, have told me all the time

28:50.096 --> 28:51.130
that they never really

28:51.130 --> 28:53.465
celebrated their name change.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.700
They just kind of went through

28:54.700 --> 28:55.701
it.

28:55.701 --> 28:56.803
So, it's not just for me.

28:56.803 --> 28:57.970
Really, it's about all of them.

28:57.970 --> 28:58.805
>> JENNY: I was thinking we

28:58.805 --> 28:59.638
should all change our name to

28:59.638 --> 29:00.639
Caitlyn.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.640
What do you think?

29:01.640 --> 29:02.541
>> CHANDI: All change our name

29:02.541 --> 29:03.542
now?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.410
>> JENNY: Just everybody go to

29:04.410 --> 29:05.411
Caitlyn.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.412
>> CHANDI: Okay.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.413
Now that would be crazy.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.548
Everybody be a Caitlyn.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.549
>> CANDIS: Does that cover

29:10.549 --> 29:11.550
enough?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.684
Does that look like it's...?

29:12.684 --> 29:14.020
Just so, like, my boobs don't

29:14.020 --> 29:15.021
pop out, like...

29:15.021 --> 29:16.022
>> MIMI: Right.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.023
>> CANDIS: I'm nervous enough as

29:17.023 --> 29:18.024
it is.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.826
>> MIMI: When was the last time

29:19.826 --> 29:22.829
you sang live somewhere in front

29:22.829 --> 29:25.932
of, like, a big group of people?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.499
>> CANDIS: It's been a while.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.400
>> MIMI: Is this your first time

29:28.400 --> 29:29.401
singing this song?

29:29.401 --> 29:30.236
>> CANDIS: Yeah. Are you trying

29:30.236 --> 29:31.237
to get me going?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.238
>> MIMI: No.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.239
>> CANDIS (laughing): Yeah.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.240
>> MIMI: I'm just trying to,

29:34.240 --> 29:35.341
like, see how you're doing.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.342
>> CANDIS: No, no, I know.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.343
I know.

29:37.343 --> 29:41.413
I feel better after rehearsing

29:41.413 --> 29:42.381
with the choir.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.682
But now that it's time to

29:43.682 --> 29:46.418
perform, I am still nervous,

29:46.418 --> 29:47.987
'cause I just want to do a good

29:47.987 --> 29:48.988
job.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.323
I want, um... I want to make

29:51.323 --> 29:52.658
this a special moment for Cait.

29:52.658 --> 29:53.659
>> MIMI: Well, you look

29:53.659 --> 29:54.660
beautiful.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.661
>> CANDIS: Thanks a lot.

29:55.661 --> 29:56.462
>> MIMI: And I don't think you

29:56.462 --> 29:57.296
should be nervous at all.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.130
>> CANDIS: Okay, I'm gonna try

29:58.130 --> 29:59.131
it.

29:59.131 --> 29:59.966
>> MIMI: All right.

29:59.966 --> 30:00.867
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna try to

30:00.867 --> 30:01.800
forget...

30:01.800 --> 30:02.634
>> MIMI: Get your shoes on,

30:02.634 --> 30:03.635
girl. It's time.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.470
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna get my

30:04.470 --> 30:06.105
shoes on.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.673
>> MAN: Ooh!

30:07.673 --> 30:09.675
(whooping and cheering)

30:09.675 --> 30:10.676
>> CANDIS: Oh, no.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.444
(Candis laughs)

30:12.444 --> 30:14.813
(cheering and whooping)

30:14.813 --> 30:19.518
My wife will be out soon.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.519
(guitar tuning)

30:20.519 --> 30:21.520
>> ALLYSON: Well, good

30:21.520 --> 30:23.789
afternoon, and welcome to the

30:23.789 --> 30:25.324
celebration.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.861
We gather here, beloved friends

30:28.861 --> 30:32.631
and family, together, uh, to

30:32.631 --> 30:36.235
celebrate a moment with our dear

30:36.235 --> 30:39.471
friend, with our sister.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.441
*

30:45.978 --> 30:48.014
(guests gasping, murmuring)

30:48.014 --> 30:49.081
(applause and cheering)

30:52.318 --> 30:56.155
(applause and cheering)

30:56.155 --> 30:57.589
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

30:57.589 --> 30:59.158
All my sisters!

30:59.158 --> 31:00.692
(Candis laughs)

31:00.692 --> 31:03.595
Hello, everybody.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.763
>> ALLYSON: Welcome.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.100
Today, this, our friend, our

31:08.100 --> 31:11.037
sister comes before you seeking

31:11.037 --> 31:13.772
a new name by which to be known.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.475
Bless her as she steps across

31:16.475 --> 31:19.611
this boundary, in your name,

31:19.611 --> 31:21.847
which above all other names, is

31:21.847 --> 31:23.782
love.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.752
Amen.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.159
>> CHANDI: Since meeting Cait at

31:33.159 --> 31:34.593
the dinner party...

31:34.593 --> 31:36.028
Hi.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.029
>> CAITLYN: It's pronounced

31:37.029 --> 31:38.030
"Chardie" or...?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.031
>> CHANDI: Chandi.

31:39.031 --> 31:39.865
>> CAITLYN: Chandi. Okay, with

31:39.865 --> 31:40.866
an "N."

31:40.866 --> 31:41.700
>> CHANDI: Right, Chandi.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.534
>> CAITLYN: Chandi, okay.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.369
>> CHANDI: This has been the

31:43.369 --> 31:45.704
most amazing time of my life.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.540
Good afternoon, everyone.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.541
(applause and cheering)

31:49.541 --> 31:50.576
Okay, I don't feel like this is

31:50.576 --> 31:51.610
a party yet.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.611
(laughter)

31:52.611 --> 31:53.612
I mean, come on now.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.713
We're here to celebrate with

31:54.713 --> 31:56.382
Caitlyn.

31:56.382 --> 32:00.987
I can't think of a time, ever,

32:00.987 --> 32:03.422
that I've so celebrated being

32:03.422 --> 32:04.690
trans.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.691
>> CAITLYN: Vocal cords-- what

32:05.691 --> 32:06.692
have you guys done?

32:06.692 --> 32:07.726
>> CHANDI: I haven't done one

32:07.726 --> 32:08.727
thing.

32:08.727 --> 32:09.661
People say, "Oh, you need to

32:09.661 --> 32:10.829
talk like this."

32:10.829 --> 32:11.830
Child, cheese.

32:11.830 --> 32:12.831
(laughter)

32:12.831 --> 32:15.501
The world needs to feel as if

32:15.501 --> 32:17.103
you are inclusive of our

32:17.103 --> 32:18.504
community.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.772
You have to start embracing the

32:20.772 --> 32:23.042
word "we."

32:23.042 --> 32:24.076
>> CAITLYN: I love Chandi.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.077
>> CHANDI: Oh.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.078
(laughter)

32:26.078 --> 32:27.546
I wanted to share some facts

32:27.546 --> 32:29.515
about the name "Caitlyn."

32:29.515 --> 32:31.650
The definition of Caitlyn is

32:31.650 --> 32:33.052
"pure and chaste."

32:33.052 --> 32:34.320
Would that be you?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.022
(laughter)

32:36.022 --> 32:37.723
You can be spontaneous,

32:37.723 --> 32:39.058
expressive and a talkative

32:39.058 --> 32:40.059
person.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.527
That's definitely you.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.528
(laughter)

32:42.528 --> 32:45.697
You are truly, truly, truly

32:45.697 --> 32:46.832
an amazing person.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.468
We're so proud of you, and we're

32:49.468 --> 32:52.838
so glad, most of all, that today

32:52.838 --> 32:55.074
you sit in your authentic self.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.808
Let's give it up for Caitlyn.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.044
>> CAITLYN: Thank you, babe.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.045
(applause and cheering)

32:59.045 --> 33:00.046
>> CHANDI: Yes.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.047
>> CAITLYN: Oh, nice.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.081
So, so nice.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.249
>> JENNY: Hello.

33:03.249 --> 33:08.120
I'm Jennifer Finney Boylan.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.588
Caitlyn and I-- we couldn't come

33:09.588 --> 33:10.922
from more different worlds.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.791
You know, I'm this New England

33:12.791 --> 33:13.792
academic.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.793
My students have called me

33:14.793 --> 33:15.794
"J-Bo."

33:15.794 --> 33:16.795
(laughter)

33:16.795 --> 33:18.230
Hey, what was that look?

33:18.230 --> 33:19.598
Like paws and whiskers.

33:19.598 --> 33:20.699
You just gave me a freaking

33:20.699 --> 33:21.700
look.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.670
Here is a poem by e.e. cummings.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.838
"i thank You God for most this

33:26.838 --> 33:28.574
amazing day...

33:28.574 --> 33:31.577
this is the birth day of life

33:31.577 --> 33:35.214
and of love and wings: and of

33:35.214 --> 33:37.449
the gay great happening

33:37.449 --> 33:39.285
illimitably earth..."

33:39.285 --> 33:41.287
I'm so proud to call Cait my

33:41.287 --> 33:42.288
friend.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.722
I'm proud of her for the good

33:43.722 --> 33:44.823
she's... she's doing.

33:44.823 --> 33:45.857
I'm proud of her for the

33:45.857 --> 33:47.326
progress she's made.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.327
Right now, you're in this thing

33:48.327 --> 33:50.396
that we call "the pink cloud,"

33:50.396 --> 33:51.830
and that means you can be a

33:51.830 --> 33:53.432
little blind to things other

33:53.432 --> 33:54.900
than yourself.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.502
A young person coming out as

33:56.502 --> 33:59.471
trans now is gonna have had

33:59.471 --> 34:01.873
Caitlyn Jenner as a role model.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.575
You don't need a man to make you

34:03.575 --> 34:04.943
a woman.

34:04.943 --> 34:07.113
You have gone to such trouble to

34:07.113 --> 34:08.214
become a woman.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.448
Don't be a stupid one.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.150
She's just a tremendously

34:11.150 --> 34:12.718
wonderful soul-- that's the

34:12.718 --> 34:14.853
person that-that I love.

34:14.853 --> 34:18.724
"(now the ears of my ears awake

34:18.724 --> 34:21.793
and now the eyes of my eyes are

34:21.793 --> 34:22.928
opened)."

34:22.928 --> 34:28.234
(applause)

34:28.234 --> 34:29.235
(Caitlyn speaks quietly)

34:29.235 --> 34:30.236
You are.

34:30.236 --> 34:33.038
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.241
Oh, you are singing.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.210
(laughter)

34:44.850 --> 34:47.886
>> CANDIS: In that moment...

34:47.886 --> 34:50.322
I am nervous, and I'm looking at

34:50.322 --> 34:52.191
Cait, and Cait looking at me.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.959
And it's just such an amazing

34:53.959 --> 34:54.960
day.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.495
This is all of our name-change

34:56.495 --> 34:57.496
ceremony.

34:57.496 --> 35:01.667
I know I have to do this.

35:03.435 --> 35:07.072
>> CANDIS: * Amazing

35:07.072 --> 35:09.341
Grace

35:09.341 --> 35:11.610
* How sweet

35:11.610 --> 35:14.446
The sound

35:14.446 --> 35:17.749
* That saved

35:17.749 --> 35:20.452
A soul

35:20.452 --> 35:23.555
* Like me

35:25.691 --> 35:28.794
* I once

35:28.794 --> 35:31.730
Was lost

35:31.730 --> 35:35.201
* But now

35:35.201 --> 35:37.803
Am found

35:37.803 --> 35:38.837
Mmm, mmm... *

35:38.837 --> 35:40.339
(chorus humming)

35:40.339 --> 35:43.242
>> CANDIS: I feel blessed to be

35:43.242 --> 35:44.676
a part of Caitlyn's journey.

35:44.676 --> 35:45.677
>> WOMAN: Who is Candis?

35:45.677 --> 35:46.678
>> WOMAN 2: Yeah, which one's

35:46.678 --> 35:48.714
Candis?

35:48.714 --> 35:49.781
>> SEVERAL WOMEN: Oh...!

35:49.781 --> 35:50.782
>> RONDA: And look how close she

35:50.782 --> 35:51.817
is-- look.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.485
>> CANDIS: This experience has

35:53.485 --> 35:54.686
meant a lot to me.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.322
>> CHILD: Being around friends

35:56.322 --> 35:58.123
is really nice when you haven't

35:58.123 --> 35:59.758
been around friends for most of

35:59.758 --> 36:00.792
your life.

36:00.792 --> 36:01.793
>> CANDIS: That's what's so

36:01.793 --> 36:03.395
magical about this, is being

36:03.395 --> 36:04.663
able to share stories with

36:04.663 --> 36:05.697
each other, which is so great,

36:05.697 --> 36:06.698
at your age, to do that.

36:06.698 --> 36:07.699
It's amazing.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.568
Going to all these amazing

36:09.568 --> 36:11.303
places and doing the work that

36:11.303 --> 36:14.440
we've done, seeing the change in

36:14.440 --> 36:18.277
myself and in Cait...

36:18.277 --> 36:21.347
has changed my life forever.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.250
* Was blind

36:24.250 --> 36:27.253
But now

36:27.253 --> 36:30.256
I see. *

36:39.265 --> 36:41.267
(Chandi laughing)

36:43.569 --> 36:45.637
(guests whooping)

36:45.637 --> 36:46.638
>> CAITLYN: It's not fair, that

36:46.638 --> 36:47.639
voice, it's just not fair.

36:47.639 --> 36:48.640
>> CANDIS: I love you.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.641
>> CAITLYN: I love you, too.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.411
Thank you for doing that.

36:52.411 --> 36:56.448
>> ALLYSON: So what's in a name?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.749
Names are symbols.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.885
They are symbols of a parent's

36:59.885 --> 37:02.288
hopes and dreams, symbols that

37:02.288 --> 37:04.723
can honor the past, or that can

37:04.723 --> 37:06.758
point toward the future.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.195
And so we gather with our dear

37:10.195 --> 37:14.533
friend, with our sister.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.402
We've known her most of her life

37:16.402 --> 37:19.805
by... another name.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.473
But today, at this moment, she

37:21.473 --> 37:25.744
chooses to set that name aside.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.314
Will you join me...

37:28.314 --> 37:30.215
to receive for us your new name?

37:35.621 --> 37:38.223
And so, here we are...

37:38.223 --> 37:40.191
daughter of God.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.331
What shall your name be called?

37:50.769 --> 37:52.504
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn Marie

37:52.504 --> 37:53.972
Jenner.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.641
>> ALLYSON: If you affirm it

37:55.641 --> 37:57.543
with Caitlyn, say it with me.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.944
(guests whooping, cheering)

37:58.944 --> 38:00.812
Caitlyn Marie Jenner.

38:00.812 --> 38:01.980
(Allyson laughs)

38:01.980 --> 38:03.081
>> CAITLYN: It means a lot.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.816
>> ALLYSON: We do indeed affirm

38:04.816 --> 38:06.752
that you are Caitlyn Marie

38:06.752 --> 38:09.555
Jenner from this day forward.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.556
>> CAITLYN: Thank you very much.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.557
>> ALLYSON: Thank you.

38:11.557 --> 38:12.257
God bless you.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.258
>> CAITLYN: God bless you.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.259
>> ALLYSON: God bless you.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.260
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for doing

38:15.260 --> 38:18.229
that; that was beautiful.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.001
>> BOY GEORGE: * If there's

38:23.001 --> 38:24.370
A God

38:24.370 --> 38:26.372
* I want him to be

38:26.372 --> 38:29.941
Right here in the wind

38:29.941 --> 38:33.278
* Salvation, I can take

38:33.278 --> 38:37.516
Welcome to the human race... *

38:37.516 --> 38:38.884
>> CAITLYN: I am so blessed in

38:38.884 --> 38:40.386
so many ways.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.987
And at this point in my life, I

38:41.987 --> 38:45.924
feel so unbelievably comfortable

38:45.924 --> 38:47.393
with the decisions that I have

38:47.393 --> 38:48.394
made.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.528
I have seen so much love and

38:49.528 --> 38:50.962
support, it's just absolutely

38:50.962 --> 38:52.531
unbelievable.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.834
>> BOY GEORGE: * Oh, oh...

38:55.834 --> 38:57.536
* Oh, oh, oh...

38:57.536 --> 38:58.804
>> WOMAN: Cheers to Caitlyn.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.105
>> CAITLYN: Out two weeks,

39:00.105 --> 39:01.407
yeah!

39:01.407 --> 39:02.708
(song continues)

39:02.708 --> 39:04.610
Hey! (laughs)

39:04.610 --> 39:05.677
>> CANDIS: I've always wanted to

39:05.677 --> 39:06.412
do that.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.679
>> CAITLYN: Lookit, her hair's

39:07.679 --> 39:09.615
still perfect-- that's not fair.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.417
Ooh, look at Chandi.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.651
>> CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

39:12.651 --> 39:13.652
>> BOY GEORGE: * If there's

39:13.652 --> 39:15.186
A God... *

39:15.186 --> 39:16.455
>> WOMAN: Bang, bang, bang.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.456
>> BOY GEORGE: * I'm sure he

39:17.456 --> 39:20.058
wants me to be myself... *

39:20.058 --> 39:21.460
>> CAITLYN: We did it!

39:21.460 --> 39:22.694
(friends cheering)

39:22.694 --> 39:23.895
>> CAITLYN: Are we ready?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.597
(all whooping)

39:25.597 --> 39:26.832
>> RONDA: Here's to the road

39:26.832 --> 39:27.332
trip.

39:27.332 --> 39:29.501
(whooping)

39:29.501 --> 39:31.437
(Boy George vocalizing)

39:31.437 --> 39:32.438
>> CROWD (chanting): Caitlyn!

39:32.438 --> 39:34.473
Caitlyn! Caitlyn!

39:34.473 --> 39:36.041
>> CAITLYN: I knew nothing when

39:36.041 --> 39:37.976
I started.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.445
The transgender community-- this

39:39.445 --> 39:41.580
is my place, and this is where I

39:41.580 --> 39:43.915
belong, and it's a good feeling.

39:43.915 --> 39:44.916
>> CHORUS: * If there's

39:44.916 --> 39:47.953
A God... *

39:47.953 --> 39:49.455
>> CAITLYN: The last few months

39:49.455 --> 39:52.290
for me have been... the most

39:52.290 --> 39:55.226
amazing months of my life.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.196
(sniffling)

40:02.968 --> 40:04.470
It's gonna be tough.

40:04.470 --> 40:08.373
My family. (crying, sniffling)

40:08.373 --> 40:09.908
I want them to be proud of their

40:09.908 --> 40:11.877
daddy.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.244
(crying): These ladies over

40:13.244 --> 40:14.412
here... (sniffles)

40:14.412 --> 40:15.847
All of you girls have taught me

40:15.847 --> 40:17.549
so much.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.051
I'm struggling with it.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.120
I've seen the things that you

40:22.120 --> 40:23.955
have gone through in your life,

40:23.955 --> 40:26.858
and being so honest with this,

40:26.858 --> 40:29.895
and I so apprec... appreciate...

40:29.895 --> 40:31.830
(sniffles) all your...

40:31.830 --> 40:33.364
your input.

40:33.364 --> 40:34.966
Meeting people in this community

40:34.966 --> 40:36.602
that I never had the opportunity

40:36.602 --> 40:38.236
to meet has been the biggest

40:38.236 --> 40:39.370
education I've ever had.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.371
>> JENNY: There are all these

40:40.371 --> 40:42.040
trans women out there who are in

40:42.040 --> 40:43.374
real danger.

40:43.374 --> 40:44.375
>> BLOSSOM: I'm gonna be honest.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.711
We're basically saying the same

40:45.711 --> 40:46.978
thing you were doing, and, like,

40:46.978 --> 40:48.313
nobody wanted to hear it.

40:48.313 --> 40:49.848
>> LAYA: I didn't want to have

40:49.848 --> 40:50.849
to do this, but I ended up doing

40:50.849 --> 40:51.349
a lot of sex work.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.350
>> CAITLYN: There's a lot of

40:52.350 --> 40:53.519
people that don't make it out

40:53.519 --> 40:54.520
the other side.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.954
>> MACY: I've attempted

40:55.954 --> 40:56.955
suicide, and it got better for

40:56.955 --> 40:57.623
me.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.624
It just... (takes deep breath)

40:58.624 --> 40:59.758
it's not fair that he didn't get

40:59.758 --> 41:00.826
to see it gets better.

41:00.826 --> 41:01.860
>> CAITLYN: And I've also

41:01.860 --> 41:03.829
learned that there are so many

41:03.829 --> 41:05.263
good people out there.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.799
Thank you for being so good to

41:07.799 --> 41:08.834
me.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.201
Thank you for welcoming me into

41:10.201 --> 41:11.603
this community.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.539
I feel at home, and I have a

41:13.539 --> 41:14.606
family.

41:14.606 --> 41:15.707
>> JENNY: Everybody on Jenner.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.108
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah...

41:17.108 --> 41:18.544
It's just been great really

41:18.544 --> 41:19.911
getting to spend some time

41:19.911 --> 41:21.146
with you.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.581
Thank you for all my friends,

41:22.581 --> 41:25.416
who have been so gracious with

41:25.416 --> 41:26.985
their love for me.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.920
Hey, baby!

41:28.920 --> 41:30.856
I didn't know you were here!

41:30.856 --> 41:34.459
Everybody... it's okay!

41:34.459 --> 41:36.562
>> ESTHER: I knew it would be.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.596
>> KIM: You look beautiful.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.597
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you very

41:38.597 --> 41:39.598
much.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.567
*

41:41.567 --> 41:43.635
It has been an amazing journey

41:43.635 --> 41:45.336
for me.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.205
And I'm seeing all of it come

41:47.205 --> 41:48.574
true.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.042
(crowd shouting, cheering)

41:51.042 --> 41:53.111
>> WOMAN: Wow, what a crowd!

41:53.111 --> 41:55.380
(laughing)

41:55.380 --> 41:56.815
>> CAITLYN: I'm in a great place

41:56.815 --> 41:58.383
in life.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.719
For the first time, I feel like

42:00.719 --> 42:04.723
I fit in someplace.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.958
Being my authentic self.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.129
Thank you.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.197
Thank you.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.198
(applause)

42:13.198 --> 42:16.034
(whooping)

42:16.034 --> 42:18.503
>> SUSAN: These people are...

42:18.503 --> 42:19.638
the bravest.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.372
And they all need to be

42:21.372 --> 42:23.208
recognized and loved and taken

42:23.208 --> 42:24.710
care of and included and

42:24.710 --> 42:26.477
celebrated.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.079
I'm really proud of her.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.715
(laughs)

42:29.715 --> 42:32.217
*

42:32.217 --> 42:33.985
>> JENNY: My mother used to say

42:33.985 --> 42:35.787
you can't hate anyone whose

42:35.787 --> 42:37.155
story you know.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.857
I hope that this will enable

42:38.857 --> 42:40.626
people to know not just Cait's

42:40.626 --> 42:42.193
story, but the story of hundreds

42:42.193 --> 42:43.962
and potentially thousands of

42:43.962 --> 42:46.197
other transgender people.

42:56.374 --> 42:58.176
>> CAITLYN: I was just thinking,

42:58.176 --> 42:59.544
you know, I kind of started in

42:59.544 --> 43:02.113
bed with no makeup and the hair

43:02.113 --> 43:03.649
not done and all that kind of

43:03.649 --> 43:04.650
stuff, and I thought, you know,

43:04.650 --> 43:05.684
maybe I should just end it

43:05.684 --> 43:06.918
this way.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.387
I want to help people... in my

43:09.387 --> 43:11.089
community.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.725
We have a long way to go, but at

43:13.725 --> 43:16.027
least we got a really, really,

43:16.027 --> 43:19.064
really good beginning.

43:19.064 --> 43:21.199
And that makes my heart feel

43:21.199 --> 43:23.168
good.
