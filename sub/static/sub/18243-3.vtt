11:01.617 --> 11:03.314
Groovy.

11:03.401 --> 11:06.404
Man, that conk to my noggin
did a real number on me.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.885
Can't believe
I've forgotten how to gab.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.801
Just practice and it'll
start to feel normal.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.412
Anything else
we need to remind
Chuck about Kell?

11:14.499 --> 11:15.936
- [sniffing]
- What are you doing?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.415
Jake said he
made these today,

11:17.502 --> 11:18.852
but I don't think
they're fresh.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.115
Mine's out of this world.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.638
I mean, delish?

11:24.248 --> 11:26.424
And what's going on
with Hannah today?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.600
She runs away
whenever she gets a call.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.993
So what?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.300
Hey, are you
feeling okay?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.693
Darbie?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.172
Hey, Dad,
what are you doing here?

11:35.259 --> 11:36.652
Uh, we're just
on our way to get lunch.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.697
Hey, Kelly.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.394
Who are you?

11:39.481 --> 11:42.527
This is Amy.
Amy, this is Kelly,
and my daughter Darbie.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.528
It's very nice
to meet you.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.008
Both of you.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.054
Amy and I were
cubicle buddies
at my old job.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.272
She's catching me up
on all the gossip

11:48.359 --> 11:49.970
I've missed
since I left.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.233
Oh, does Mr. Baldoff
still rock a ponytail?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.844
No, he chopped it off
and replaced it with
a mustache.

11:54.931 --> 11:57.325
Even trade.
[chuckles]

11:57.412 --> 11:59.109
Oh, Dad, this is
our friend Chuck.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.721
Hey. What's up?
I'm Darbie's bestie,

12:01.808 --> 12:05.594
and I'm super psyched
to get your digits
and Snapchat you.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.293
Huh?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
Shouldn't you be
getting to your lunch,
Mr. O'Brien?

12:11.861 --> 12:14.821
Uh, yeah,
I guess we should.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.387
It's nice to meet you,
Darbie.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.349
There's something
I don't trust
about that woman.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.829
- What?
- I mean,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.266
what kind of buddies
gossip at lunch?

12:25.353 --> 12:27.442
Which part is odd,
the lunch or the gossip?

12:27.529 --> 12:30.488
I wonder if Amy
is her real name.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.663
Kell, what's going on
with you?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.143
You're acting
kind of paranoid.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.710
Is that what they're
saying about me?

12:34.797 --> 12:36.756
You're suspicious
of everything,

12:36.843 --> 12:40.411
ever since we gained
a certain someone's trust.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.632
Oh, snicker doodles,
you're...

12:43.719 --> 12:44.720
[whispers]
spelled.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.031
Welcome to Jake's
Food Bike, how--

12:53.033 --> 12:54.077
Can I help you?

12:54.164 --> 12:56.340
One bottle of water.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.343
All I have is 100.
You can keep the change.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.520
You really think you could
buy back my friendship with
100 bucks?

13:02.607 --> 13:03.957
200?

13:04.044 --> 13:06.350
Oh, Jake,
I understand
you might be

13:06.437 --> 13:07.874
a little upset
I froze the town.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.092
Don't you get it?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.094
When you froze the town,
you froze me.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.096
And left me that way.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.882
I knew the girls
would figure out a way
to break the curse.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.449
I'm just sorry
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to you.

13:18.536 --> 13:21.975
Maybe you could have
if you hadn't been so busy
stealing my food bike.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.499
Didn't Kelly tell you
I left if for you in
Lavender Heights?

13:24.586 --> 13:25.805
Where it was stolen.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.763
Again.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.460
I see what this is about.

13:29.547 --> 13:30.984
I'll buy you a new bike.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.550
Please don't.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.813
Then what do you want?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
Tell me and I'll
give it to you.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.424
I want you to
go back to Paris.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.124
Seriously.
Nobody wants you here.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.169
So why don't you
just leave.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.826
You're right.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.393
There's nothing here for me
in this waste of a town.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.355
I'll be there.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.444
Have a great day.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.662
- Kelly's under a spell.
- What?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.751
We made Chuck
more trusting,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.450
but somehow it's made
Kelly suspicious of,
like, everything.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.234
I haven't noticed
anything.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.280
What's going on?
Why are you guys
over here without me?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.543
Are you two
plotting behind my back?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.023
Okay, now I see it.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.589
Kell, we think you're
under a spell.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.896
Oh, you would say that.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.463
We need to figure out
how to break it.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.291
But we can't do that
while watching Chuck.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.470
Kelly's under a spell,

14:22.557 --> 14:25.516
so you want me to
baby sit a ghost from 1965?

14:25.603 --> 14:28.780
He's not a ghost,
he was just trapped in time.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.826
Because that makes it
so much better.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.698
It's just until
Miss Silvers finishes
her lessons for the day.

14:33.785 --> 14:34.830
Please?

14:34.917 --> 14:36.397
[cell phone buzzing]

14:38.268 --> 14:39.966
Why did I just get
a text from Darbie
that says,

14:40.053 --> 14:43.621
"Hey, BFF.
Texting is how we talk."

14:43.708 --> 14:46.146
- "YOLO."
- Yeah, that's Chuck.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.757
Darbie's teaching him
how to use a cell phone.

14:48.844 --> 14:52.195
Right. Look,
you all clearly have a lot
on your plate today,

14:52.282 --> 14:53.936
but I've got food
to sell.

14:54.023 --> 14:54.981
But, Jake--

14:55.068 --> 14:57.287
[clattering]

14:57.374 --> 15:00.682
[groans]
This stupid fridge has been
going out on me all day.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.640
Because they're
out to get you.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.772
Huh?
Who's out to get me?

15:03.859 --> 15:06.862
You know.
[whispers] Them.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.388
Looks like it's
me and the ghost.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.870
"To give your trust,
to build a rapport,

15:14.957 --> 15:17.655
"take care that your friend
needs it more."

15:17.742 --> 15:21.007
That's it.
To give your trust.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.313
The spell didn't make
Chuck more trusting,

15:23.400 --> 15:26.534
it literally gave Chuck
Kelly's ability to trust.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.884
You are
pretty trusting, Kell.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.886
You always fall for my
April Fools jokes,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.105
like, always.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.889
And now you don't
trust anybody.

15:33.976 --> 15:37.023
Why should I?
Everyone's lying to me,
like Hannah.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.241
Excuse me?

15:38.328 --> 15:40.156
You've been
on your phone all day.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.333
I'm always on my phone.
So are you, big deal.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.161
Yeah, but every time
you get a phone call,

15:45.248 --> 15:46.684
you walk away.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.077
So what?

15:48.164 --> 15:49.383
If you don't have
anything to hide,

15:49.470 --> 15:51.124
then let me see
your phone.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.734
- No!
- Kelly, stop!

15:52.821 --> 15:54.475
It's a spell.
You never do this.

15:54.562 --> 15:55.911
Give it back!
Give it back right now!

15:55.998 --> 15:57.652
- It's private!
- "Miss Parker Kent,

15:57.739 --> 16:00.002
"this email confirms your
orientation next week at

16:00.089 --> 16:02.613
"Fox Canyon Magnet."

16:04.137 --> 16:05.486
You're going to
a new school?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.401
Wait, what?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.535
It's a magnet school
on the other side of town.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.320
My parents are
making me go.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.712
Why didn't you tell us?

16:14.799 --> 16:17.280
Because I didn't want to
make you upset.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.326
'Cause that would
make me upset.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.589
Now we're all upset.

16:21.676 --> 16:25.723
That's why you're
pushing so hard for
our summer of fun.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.247
It's 'cause it's
our last summer together.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.378
No, it's not.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.684
Yes, it is.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.425
You're gonna go
to Fox Canyon,

16:31.512 --> 16:33.644
and meet new friends
that you'll like
better than us,

16:33.731 --> 16:35.646
and then forget us
by second period.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.257
Kelly, you know that
none of this will ever hap--

16:37.344 --> 16:38.954
[door opens]

16:39.041 --> 16:42.871
Oh. Thank goodness
you girls are all right.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.394
Why wouldn't we be?

16:44.481 --> 16:46.048
I've been looking
everywhere for Chuck.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.137
And when I couldn't
find him,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.879
I was afraid
something terrible
had happened.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.621
Actually, we have to
talk about Chuck.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.101
Alone.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.580
Away from prying eyes.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.151
Kelly's getting worse.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.675
Cast one little spell
that freezes the town,

17:05.762 --> 17:07.287
and suddenly you're
the bad guy.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.137
Bonjour,Jacques.

17:31.224 --> 17:34.357
I need you to look after
Madam P's a little longer.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.490
I have to
take care of something
before I can leave.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.016
There's no need
to be rude.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.977
Let me get this straight.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.458
You spent the whole day
with Chuck.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.852
Oh, come on, Kelly,
we've been over this.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.898
He's dangerous.
Trust me.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.291
No.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.597
Excuse me?

17:56.684 --> 17:58.729
No, I don't trust you.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.212
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

18:03.299 --> 18:06.520
Well, I don't like
the lack of explanations.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.261
[sighs]

18:08.348 --> 18:10.176
It's complicated.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.482
A lot happened
50 years ago.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.181
Exactly.
Chuck's been gone
half a century,

18:15.268 --> 18:17.618
but you said
you kept trying to
bring him back.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.099
We did.
We tried for years.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.013
If you really wanted
to bring him back,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.625
why didn't you just use
your morbium?

18:24.712 --> 18:28.455
And-- and for that matter,
what did you use it on?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.631
Darbie: Kelly,
we need you in the kitchen.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.025
Eyes on you, Grandma.

18:36.811 --> 18:37.768
[sighs]

18:41.032 --> 18:43.122
Hey, Kelly.
We made some baklava
for my Dad,

18:43.209 --> 18:44.732
but it doesn't
taste right.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.168
I think we used
too much honey.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.344
No, Darbie,
it's too much cinnamon.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.606
Can you settle it
for us?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.217
I know what you're doing.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.958
It's the old
"get Kelly to eat
baklava" trick.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.743
Magic baklava?

18:55.830 --> 18:57.788
That's just silly talk
is what that is.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.094
How many times do I
have to tell you

18:59.181 --> 19:00.443
I'm not under a spell?

19:00.530 --> 19:02.141
It's perfectly
normal baklava.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.707
Here, I'll eat a piece
to prove it.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.275
Wait. You really think
I'll fall for that?

19:06.362 --> 19:09.800
You'll eat the normal piece,
and I'll eat the magic piece.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.889
Nice try.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.500
But you knew I'd be
too smart for that,

19:13.587 --> 19:15.066
so you gave yourself
the spell piece

19:15.154 --> 19:18.026
knowing that I'd
reach for it.

19:18.113 --> 19:21.812
Except you both know
that I'd figure that out.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.249
But you didn't
count on me knowing

19:23.336 --> 19:26.077
I'd know you knew
what I know.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.557
And that's proof
I'm not spelled.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.039
Oh. Also, Hannah,
you're right.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.346
Too much cinnamon.
This is gross.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.133
So is this.
What is this?

19:38.220 --> 19:39.917
Tamarind juice.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.528
With merwaldian sugar.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.356
Wait, what?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.923
We knew you'd be
too paranoid
to eat any magic,

19:46.010 --> 19:48.448
so we tricked you into
drinking some instead.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.753
Take Back Tamarind Juice.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.712
It should counter
the Trust Me Tabouli

19:51.799 --> 19:53.540
by taking back your trust.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.020
Unless you still think
dogs are undercover spies

19:56.107 --> 19:57.500
tracking our every move.

19:57.587 --> 19:58.762
Of course not.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.068
Or that we're
all holograms

20:00.155 --> 20:02.244
in someone else's
imagination.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.680
It made sense
a minute ago.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.291
Or that our friendship
won't survive

20:05.378 --> 20:08.163
me going to
a new school.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.775
No, no,
I don't think that.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.690
I'm sorry.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.215
It was the magic
making me think that
everyone was lying.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.782
It was horrible.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.523
Oh, no. Grandma.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.703
Kelly,
we need to talk.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.053
Grandma, I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.839
Kelly was under a spell
that made her suspicious,
Grandma Q.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.754
But we countered it.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.409
Well, that explains
your behavior.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.062
I didn't mean
anything I said.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.455
None of it.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.456
Can you please forgive me?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.377
[sighs] Oh, girls.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.814
I know this
Chuck situation is...

20:50.901 --> 20:52.163
unusual.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.165
I'm just trying to
keep everybody safe.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.082
I know, and we promise
we'll be more careful
around Chuck.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.606
I trust you.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.740
Thank you.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.873
And to answer your question
from before,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.789
I would have used
my morbium to save Chuck,

21:08.876 --> 21:12.880
but he stole my seed
when he stole Ida's.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.882
But if Chuck stole it,
then why did--

21:14.969 --> 21:17.798
Wait. Chuck has
two morbium seeds?

21:17.885 --> 21:19.321
Mm-hmm.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.149
No wonder you're
so worried about him.

21:21.236 --> 21:24.892
I told you.
He's dangerous.

21:24.979 --> 21:29.462
[sighs] Guys,
I'm so sorry for
how I acted today.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.855
It was the magic.
We understand.

21:31.942 --> 21:34.075
Wait, now that I have
my trust back,

21:34.162 --> 21:36.860
does that mean that
Chuck won't trust us anymore?

21:36.947 --> 21:39.385
Chuck's been texting me
emojis from Jake's phone.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.256
I think we're good.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.346
About everything
I said earlier,

21:44.433 --> 21:49.133
um, you know I was just
under a spell, right?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.309
It doesn't matter
where you go to school,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.441
we'll always be friends.

21:52.528 --> 21:53.790
I know.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.662
I'm just glad
we un-spelled you

21:55.749 --> 21:58.229
before you said anything
you'd really regret
to your grandma.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.709
I'd call this a good day.

21:59.796 --> 22:03.365
Well, yeah, except
Grandma just told us

22:03.452 --> 22:06.281
that Chuck stole
her morbium seed.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.502
- So?
- Well, when she was under
the Settle The Beef spell,

22:09.589 --> 22:12.331
Miss Silvers said that
she never forgave Grandma

22:12.418 --> 22:16.291
for how she used
her morbium.

22:16.378 --> 22:20.861
Guys, I think Grandma
lied to us.

Nice work, Chuck.

22:34.178 --> 22:35.310
Good job.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.313
Make a fist.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.709
That's a fist bump.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.928
It's like a handshake,
but cooler.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.408
Groovy.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.411
Hey, uh, how did you know
how to fix this thing?

Yeah. Yeah.
