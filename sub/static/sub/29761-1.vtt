things less boring.

I just hope that
you're not doing this

turn out to be the guy

disrespect your feelings.

yourself because a guy

16:03.296 --> 16:05.379
gave you the best
fuck of your life

16:05.381 --> 16:07.047
and then broke up with you

16:07.049 --> 16:10.594

tragic sweetness to it.

Have I heard your real reason
for making this decision?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.069
DANNY: Context.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.365
You need context, Simon.

turned into that guy.

said anything.

I think that staying faithful

29:32.939 --> 29:37.607
Lance, Christian,
they were all into it.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.031
And yes, I even thought
it was stimulating,

29:43.825 --> 29:52.081
but there was more.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.084
I don't follow, Danny.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.173
DANNY: I was young, insecure.

29:59.715 --> 30:00.549
They weren't.

30:02.051 --> 30:07.138
Danny, what did
Kyle lie about?

30:07.140 --> 30:08.099
DANNY: About us.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.809
About himself.

30:49.307 --> 30:50.515
Good morning.

30:50.517 --> 30:51.351
Hey.

30:53.644 --> 30:54.479
You alright?

30:55.980 --> 31:04.069
I'm okay.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.990
What time did we
get in last night?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.285
More like three
o'clock this morning.

31:17.419 --> 31:18.545
Thanks for last night.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.297
DANNY: You're welcome.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.758
You know, you don't
have to do that again

31:26.760 --> 31:27.846
if you don't want to.

31:30.682 --> 31:31.891
DANNY: It's fine.

31:33.101 --> 31:33.935
Whatever.

31:36.354 --> 31:37.230
Just fine?

31:39.941 --> 31:47.947
Okay, it was kinda
fun, different.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.035
That was the most fun
I ever had doing that.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.954
Totally because you were there.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.374
DANNY: That's sweet,

31:59.376 --> 32:00.211
I think.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.382
Still have some doubts?

32:09.846 --> 32:11.847
What do Lance and
Christian really do?

32:13.599 --> 32:18.605
I know you maintain their
websites and update their servers,

32:20.022 --> 32:24.650
but it seems like they
steered the conversation

32:24.652 --> 32:27.029
away any time I asked about
their actual business.

32:28.906 --> 32:29.740
Did they?

32:30.657 --> 32:31.784
Seems like they did.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.373
Hm.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.290
See, there it is again.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.253
It's like a weird dodge
to a simple question.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.423
How do Lance and Christian
make their money?

32:51.554 --> 32:52.389
Yeah.

32:54.516 --> 32:57.683
Lance and Christian
are somewhat discreet

32:57.685 --> 32:58.811
about their businesses.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.773
They both used to be
software engineers

33:03.775 --> 33:05.985
for big companies before
doing their own thing.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.698
Don't tell me
they're drug dealers.

33:10.781 --> 33:11.615
No.

33:13.117 --> 33:17.913
They enjoy drugs for sure,
but they don't sell 'em.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.835
So what is it?

33:25.422 --> 33:26.548
They're porn sites.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.049
No big deal.

33:30.593 --> 33:35.054
What kind of porn sites?

33:35.056 --> 33:37.806
Nothing out there.

33:37.808 --> 33:42.230
It's guys fucking, sucking,

33:44.898 --> 33:49.401
the usual, mostly.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.238
Mostly?

33:52.115 --> 33:55.365
Okay, the tickling site
is a little weird, maybe,

33:55.367 --> 34:02.123
but certainly nothing
illegal or gross.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.999
And you do what?

34:05.170 --> 34:06.086
Maintain their servers?

34:07.838 --> 34:08.882
Pretty much.

34:10.592 --> 34:11.925
I update the site, too.

34:13.344 --> 34:17.597
Organize the banner ads.

34:17.599 --> 34:20.141
And they make that
much money from it.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.436
Fuck, yeah.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.190
They make serious money just
from the ones I work on.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.900
I know they have
other sites, too,

34:29.902 --> 34:32.527
with guys just like
me on the payroll,

34:32.530 --> 34:35.492
keeping it all running
like clockwork.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.536
Clearly they pay you well.

34:41.164 --> 34:41.998
Very well.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.833
Look around.

34:49.088 --> 34:53.632
It's all because of
Lance and Christian.

34:53.635 --> 34:56.635
It's a perfect setup for me.

34:56.637 --> 34:57.639
I work from home.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.434
The work itself isn't very hard.

35:03.978 --> 35:06.646
I take vacations pretty
much whenever I want.

35:06.648 --> 35:10.983
And I can watch 'em
film when I like.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.445
They actually make porn, too?

35:14.072 --> 35:19.077
Sometimes, for
their VIP members.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.536
They fly in people
to do certain scenes

35:21.538 --> 35:22.956
that get requested by them.

35:23.998 --> 35:25.458
What kind of scenes?

35:28.753 --> 35:30.253
I've only known of two times

35:30.255 --> 35:31.420
since I started working for them

35:31.422 --> 35:34.174
that they put these
VIP scenes together.

35:35.927 --> 35:40.762
One was bringing some gay
porn star with a 10-inch dick

35:40.764 --> 35:44.099
from the '80s out of retirement

35:44.101 --> 35:46.769
to fuck some twink.

35:46.771 --> 35:50.356
The other was a couple of
identical twin brothers

35:50.358 --> 35:51.693
fucking each other.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.405
They paid 'em something
like 10,000 bucks to do it,

35:57.364 --> 35:58.198
all cash.

35:59.909 --> 36:00.744
Crazy.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.124
I wish I could
say I was shocked,

36:08.126 --> 36:21.970
but after meeting them,
I can't say that I am.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.808
Promise you, they're
on the up and up.

36:26.561 --> 36:29.189
They pay their taxes and
play by the Internet's rules.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.777
They may be pervs, but
they aren't criminals.

36:36.487 --> 36:37.612
SIMON: Kyle
lied about himself.

36:37.614 --> 36:41.949
Is that why you're doing this?

36:41.951 --> 36:44.161
DANNY: It's why
I have to kill them,

going to kill them.

You mean this in a

He could be
exaggerating to impress.

Danny, are you still there?

probably put money

Christian's pockets.

They reduce people to
zeros and ones, literally.

sleazy, but it's legal,

plants' employees?

44:27.208 --> 44:28.916
DANNY: Not so well.

44:28.918 --> 44:30.876
You've been
brainwashed, Danny.

44:30.878 --> 44:32.463
Brainwashed to want less.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.923
I mean, you think
Christian and I have

44:36.925 --> 44:39.217
what we have because
we worked hard?

44:39.219 --> 44:40.219
No.

44:40.221 --> 44:42.054
We work smart.

44:42.056 --> 44:44.432
We stopped caring what
other people thought,

44:44.434 --> 44:46.309
all those hang-ups and guilt.

44:46.311 --> 44:47.479
Fuck that.

44:50.523 --> 44:51.938
I'm sure Kyle has
told you by now

44:51.940 --> 44:54.983
how Christian and
I make our money.

44:54.985 --> 44:56.445
Yeah, a little.

44:57.697 --> 45:00.322
You're slaving away
in some tech cubicle,

45:00.324 --> 45:02.032
being paid just enough

45:02.034 --> 45:04.244
to afford a shitty
little studio apartment.

45:05.079 --> 45:06.412
Hey, I get it.

45:06.414 --> 45:09.039
Christian and I did the
same thing for years.

45:09.041 --> 45:12.918
All that got us was credit
card debt and Klonopin refills.

45:12.920 --> 45:21.010
Making some board of
directors wealthy.

45:21.012 --> 45:25.180
Danny, you stop caring
what other people think

45:25.182 --> 45:29.603
and start having fun,
unabashedly, unashamedly,

45:30.855 --> 45:33.356
Buddy, you are in for
the ride of your life,

45:33.358 --> 45:37.946
and we are the perfect people
to strap you in for it.

45:41.407 --> 45:43.865
DANNY: I didn't say
much during dinner.

45:43.867 --> 45:45.492
It all felt like I
was watching a movie

45:45.494 --> 45:46.827
of other people eating dinner.

45:46.829 --> 45:48.121
(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC)

45:48.123 --> 45:50.039
The only person who
said less than me

45:50.041 --> 45:51.501
was this Forrest guy.

45:52.668 --> 45:55.087
So obvious, looking
back on it now.

45:56.338 --> 45:58.173
When does the new
server go online?

45:59.967 --> 46:01.719
Another week, maybe two.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.429
Gotta keep expanding.

46:04.431 --> 46:05.554
If you're not
growin', you're dyin',

46:05.556 --> 46:06.515
right, Forrest?

46:07.934 --> 46:12.394
That's one way
to look at things.

46:12.396 --> 46:15.607
I'm not sure I see where
you fit in in all of this.

46:20.070 --> 46:25.032
I do not think it
is my place to say.

46:25.034 --> 46:26.200
I can say.

46:26.202 --> 46:27.078
Anyone object?

46:28.621 --> 46:31.496
Darling, you know no one
here has any objections

46:31.498 --> 46:32.623
to anything.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.208
Hear, hear.

46:34.210 --> 46:37.170
We met Forrest
at the Lion's Pub.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.420
Remember?

46:38.422 --> 46:39.798
It's not even there anymore.

46:40.884 --> 46:42.342
Right.

46:42.344 --> 46:47.054
This is when Lance and
I were objectively sexy.

46:47.056 --> 46:49.849
I know we still
look great, but, um,

46:49.851 --> 46:54.271
there's looking good,
and there's fucking hot.

46:55.065 --> 46:57.981
This is back when we were
fucking hot, right, Forrest?

46:57.983 --> 47:00.235
Two young bucks.

47:03.030 --> 47:04.280
Yeah.

47:04.282 --> 47:09.077
Forrest, he told us
that he knew some people

47:09.079 --> 47:10.872
and that we could
make some money.

47:12.831 --> 47:13.748
And then, bam!

47:13.750 --> 47:14.666
We'd left our corporate jobs,

47:14.668 --> 47:16.126
gone to business for ourselves,

47:17.170 --> 47:19.047
never looked back.

47:20.965 --> 47:22.840
Thank you, Forrest.

47:22.842 --> 47:24.133
Not at all.

47:24.135 --> 47:28.220
You boys have taken
things to new levels,

47:28.222 --> 47:31.976
ones I would have never
even thought to reach for.

47:33.478 --> 47:34.354
So, what?

47:35.646 --> 47:37.940
You guys made a
porn film together?

47:39.108 --> 47:41.775
Uh, yeah, more than one.

47:41.777 --> 47:43.695
But you still
won't let me see?

47:43.697 --> 47:45.070
It says a lot
about your IT skills

47:45.072 --> 47:47.030
that you can't find any of them.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.490
Well, it's not like he
needs to look for them

47:48.492 --> 47:51.078
since we give him a private
show every so often.

47:56.710 --> 47:58.291
What?

47:58.293 --> 47:59.126
Oh, jeez.

47:59.128 --> 48:00.003
Fine.

48:00.005 --> 48:01.295
This wine is just so good

48:01.297 --> 48:03.757
it's making me say
the darnedest things.

48:06.969 --> 48:09.052
No, you sit your cute self down.

48:09.054 --> 48:11.181
Don't even think about
trying to clean up.

48:12.559 --> 48:14.891
Kyle, keep him up to
his nipples in Shiraz.

48:14.893 --> 48:16.645
He's barely even
finished one glass.

48:18.981 --> 48:33.327
Aye, aye, captain.

48:33.329 --> 48:34.831
You feel overwhelmed.

48:36.498 --> 48:41.503
Nah, it's just different
from where I grew up.

48:43.088 --> 48:47.760
Yes, Nebraska, home of the
Brianna wine grape varietal.

48:49.012 --> 48:52.182
Perfect for salads
and fine cheeses.

48:54.224 --> 48:56.226
I've never tried any
of the wines from there.

48:57.644 --> 48:58.978
Has anyone?

48:58.980 --> 49:00.940
FORREST: Now, now,
don't be a wine snob.

49:02.567 --> 49:03.400
Too late.

49:05.235 --> 49:06.320
Grab the salt and pepper?

49:10.574 --> 49:12.368
Don't be afraid to help, Kyle.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.554
You don't seem relaxed.

49:32.389 --> 49:33.556
Am I the cause of that?

49:35.474 --> 49:36.476
I don't think so.

49:38.853 --> 49:41.106
It's new.

49:43.483 --> 49:44.818
Kyle is new.

49:46.193 --> 49:47.027
Job's new.

49:49.239 --> 49:53.159
The city, the lifestyle,

49:54.327 --> 49:56.663
I just haven't
found my feet yet.

You know?

50:05.463 --> 50:09.676
(LOW, JARRING

50:11.302 --> 50:12.262
I do know.

50:13.471 --> 50:14.887
Yeah.

50:14.889 --> 50:15.724
Sure.

50:17.307 --> 50:20.184
I can help you
with that, Danny,

50:20.186 --> 50:23.646
help you find the
proverbial shoes

50:23.648 --> 50:26.776
to keep you from falling.

50:28.318 --> 50:30.195
Like you helped
Lance and Christian?

50:33.907 --> 50:36.076
Every individual is different.

50:38.579 --> 50:42.164
I don't think I'm like any
individual you've ever helped.

50:42.166 --> 50:43.668
I'm inclined to agree.

50:48.005 --> 50:50.799
You met me three hours ago.

50:55.387 --> 50:58.597
Now you're offering
me something?

50:58.599 --> 51:00.768
Surely you can see
how strange that is.

51:04.606 --> 51:06.983
You're bolder than I expected.

51:08.233 --> 51:11.485
Polite, but bold.

51:11.487 --> 51:12.321
I like that,

51:14.239 --> 51:16.492
but is it so strange?

51:20.246 --> 51:23.956
Let me ask you something.

51:23.958 --> 51:26.878
Do you think you're
a good person, Danny?

51:27.753 --> 51:29.505
DANNY: Yeah, I think so.

51:30.547 --> 51:33.508
Honest, caring, follow through

51:33.510 --> 51:35.387
on what you say you'll do?

51:36.179 --> 51:39.805
Sure.

51:39.807 --> 51:40.641
I agree.

51:42.226 --> 51:46.938
So, why wouldn't I
want to help someone

51:46.940 --> 51:48.900
with those fine qualities?

51:51.277 --> 51:52.195
I don't know.

51:56.949 --> 51:57.783
Good.

52:08.253 --> 52:09.961
Good time?

52:09.963 --> 52:10.797
Sure.

52:12.007 --> 52:16.717
A little surreal,
but never boring.

52:16.719 --> 52:17.553
True.

52:19.097 --> 52:21.472
Was surprised to see
Forrest here tonight.

52:21.474 --> 52:22.764
DANNY: Is he still involved

52:22.766 --> 52:25.352
in Lance and Christian's
business, financially?

52:26.730 --> 52:27.729
Don't know.

52:27.731 --> 52:28.565
Probably.

52:30.275 --> 52:31.733
I think Forrest asked me to be

52:31.735 --> 52:33.945
in one of his porn
films, tonight.

52:35.405 --> 52:36.820
Really?

52:36.822 --> 52:37.656
He said that?

52:38.449 --> 52:40.868
He said he wanted to help me.

52:42.454 --> 52:43.830
KYLE: Could mean
a lot of things.

52:44.873 --> 52:46.541
Would you mind if I did one,

52:48.208 --> 52:49.960
if they paid me enough?

52:51.378 --> 52:52.670
You're actually
thinking about this?

52:52.672 --> 52:54.715
I would only wanna
do it if it's with you.

52:56.592 --> 53:00.512
KYLE: Well, that wouldn't
be up to me, or you, really.

53:03.057 --> 53:04.349
DANNY: You sound
like you don't care.

53:04.351 --> 53:06.601
Why?

53:06.603 --> 53:08.478
Because I don't require
you to be anything

53:08.480 --> 53:10.148
other than exactly who you are?

53:12.317 --> 53:14.733
I can't say no if
you're really curious.

53:14.735 --> 53:16.151
I know they'll pay well.

53:16.153 --> 53:17.528
Pay well?

53:17.530 --> 53:18.865
Are you serious?

53:22.117 --> 53:23.744
Let's talk about this later.

53:26.581 --> 53:28.539
DANNY: That was
the first big test

53:28.541 --> 53:31.249
that Kyle failed, Simon.

53:31.251 --> 53:32.751
What test?

53:32.753 --> 53:34.336
DANNY: Oh, come on.

53:34.338 --> 53:38.092
I wasn't actually gonna act
in a fucking online porn film.

53:39.260 --> 53:41.094
I just wanted to see
if Kyle loved me enough

53:41.096 --> 53:43.345
to try and stop
me from doing it.

53:43.347 --> 53:44.807
That isn't fair to Kyle.

53:46.226 --> 53:48.434
You weren't being
honest with him.

53:48.436 --> 53:49.976
DANNY: Fair to Kyle?

53:49.978 --> 53:50.980
That's a laugh.

53:52.190 --> 53:54.398
I'm sure he'll wise
up once I put this gun

53:54.400 --> 53:56.191
to the back of his head.

53:56.193 --> 53:58.528
I really hope it
doesn't come to that.

54:02.367 --> 54:04.450
Police are notified,
report is filed.

54:04.452 --> 54:06.287

the call for now.

54:07.414 --> 54:08.704
Are they tracing?

54:08.706 --> 54:09.706
Trying to.

54:09.708 --> 54:11.124
Not easy, though.

54:11.126 --> 54:12.208
I'll keep you posted.

54:12.210 --> 54:18.798
You keep Danny talking.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.340
Okay, Danny, I'm back.

54:20.342 --> 54:22.011
DANNY: Trying
to trace the call?

54:23.221 --> 54:24.887
Good luck with that.

54:24.889 --> 54:27.182
Whether the call is
being traced or not,

54:28.393 --> 54:29.351
I wanna listen to you,

54:30.519 --> 54:32.188
and I want you to tell me more.

54:33.523 --> 54:35.148
DANNY: Okay.

54:35.150 --> 54:37.858
After all, I wanna
make sure it's clear

54:37.860 --> 54:39.362
as to why I did this.

54:41.322 --> 54:44.282
Don't want any loose
ends or weird theories

when you take two hits

56:34.853 --> 56:35.729
off of that pipe.

56:39.481 --> 56:40.650
I'm on top of things.

Oh, come on, we don't have
to talk about that now.

56:50.534 --> 56:51.450
Fine.

56:51.452 --> 56:53.038
I don't think he's game for it.

56:57.916 --> 56:59.251
What alternative?

57:01.588 --> 57:02.922
You can't be serious.

57:04.507 --> 57:12.387
I don't think I can do...

57:12.389 --> 57:13.223
Okay.

57:14.684 --> 57:18.436
Yeah, I'm sorry.

57:18.438 --> 57:19.731
I'll get it done.

remember Kyle coming

57:34.454 --> 57:35.497
to bed at all that night.

The next morning, he was still
at his laptop in the kitchen.

Get any sleep last night?

57:44.755 --> 57:46.088
Not much.

- Coffee?
- Absolutely.

57:54.682 --> 57:56.307
Is everything okay?

57:56.309 --> 57:58.894
Yeah, just really tired.

58:00.146 --> 58:01.481
Didn't get any sleep.

to finish this new set-up

have to go over tonight

and be fine for later.

Uh, yeah, it's a valid email.

something was very wrong.

what you say happened.

the camera on too early,

be able to trace it.

up to with these emails?

detail all of Lance and
Christian's cooked accounting,

01:25:47.564 --> 01:25:50.732

Forrest helped them set up

of that should be enough

from the hard drive.
