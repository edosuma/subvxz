Previously on Chance...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.672
CHANCE:
I'm trying to help my patients

00:04.705 --> 00:06.974
by removing whatever source
of ongoing trauma

00:07.007 --> 00:09.143
is preventing them
from experiencing

00:09.177 --> 00:10.211
the benefits of therapy.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.380
(grunting)

00:12.413 --> 00:15.083
D: The next asshole up
should be that gay-basher.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.517
CHANCE:
Wade Pardo.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.319
Is it cool for me to act
like that, or only you?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.987
Are you thinking
of doing something

00:20.020 --> 00:22.990
that has an outcome you
can't live with? Again?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.758
D: How long do you think
it's gonna take the cops

00:24.792 --> 00:27.495
to figure out you and your job
are the common denominator

00:27.528 --> 00:29.430
between these guys?
Hey.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.432
Woman found with
her throat cut,

00:31.465 --> 00:34.435
a kid shot in the head
breaking into a car registered

00:34.468 --> 00:37.071
to Ryan Winter.
I'm gonna need you

00:37.105 --> 00:39.940
to get into
Ryan Winter's head for me.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.576
You must get tired.
What?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.944
Talking about this so much,

00:43.977 --> 00:45.613
then nothing happens.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.116
Nothing changes.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.452
You know, there's something
different about you, doc.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.886
Something in your eyes.

Molly, how are we
doing over here?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.183
MOLLY:
He's still in shock.

Nurse Allen

Okay, good.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.329
(monitor beeping steadily)

02:18.872 --> 02:20.474
It's all right,
Mr. Winter.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.143
We got you.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.713
You lost consciousness
there for a little bit,

02:25.746 --> 02:29.016
hit your head, but
we're taking care of it.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.518
Easy now, sir.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.453
Hey, do we know where
radiology's at?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.521
Shit!

02:33.554 --> 02:34.622
(beeping intensifies)

02:34.655 --> 02:35.656
WOMAN:
We need you to assist!

02:35.689 --> 02:36.690
A little help here, please!

02:40.093 --> 02:42.463
All right. I got him.
Four milligrams
of Lorazepam, now.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.797
Yes, doctor.
Right away.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.733
We might need to restrain him.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.168
CHANCE:
Mr. Winter.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.538
Mr. Winter.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.406

02:52.440 --> 02:53.907
Look at me.
It's all right.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.478
You're safe here.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.180
No one's gonna hurt you.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.216
CHANCE:
Just breathe slowly like this.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.851
In through the nose.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.253
(inhales)

03:05.286 --> 03:07.688
Count of four.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.324
Out through the mouth.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.241
Good.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.710
You've activated your
parasympathetic nervous system.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.446
Counterbalances
the fight-or-flight.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.249
Call it "rest and digest."

03:35.283 --> 03:37.685
Give you
a very light sedative.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.588
It'll keep you calm
in the MRI, all right?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.725

Now I know.

Who's Stevie?

Fucking Hynes is obsessed.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.612
Whole timeline on his wall
about murder

07:24.645 --> 07:27.314
and where this Winter
was when.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.483
CHANCE:
What wall?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.984
The wall in his apartment.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.821
His apartment?
How do you know this?

07:33.854 --> 07:37.525
You broke in?
You broke in to his place?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.793
Definitely
keep asking me that.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.994
Really productive.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.363
Goddamn it.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.533
What did you find?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.267
Him having a timeline
on his wall,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.302
that could just be him
being a dedicated cop.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.704
Yeah, he is.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.106
He's very dedicated
and organized.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.343
Also, he was transferred
from San Fran PD to Fremont PD

07:56.376 --> 07:59.747
after a mandated psych eval
because he's half a whack job.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.284
What?
When?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.454
About six months after
he started fixating on Winter.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.557
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Thompson
to cardiology, please.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.191
Dr. Thompson to cardiology.
Pretty early for you

08:11.224 --> 08:12.793
to be at work already,
isn't it, doc?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.227
I was just leaving.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.330
We need to talk.
I'll come to you.

Move! Move!
Oh!

**

08:29.409 --> 08:30.711
D: I say sit tight.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.213
Fucking Hynes says jump,
and you jump?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.414
What the fuck, doc?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.149
(sighs)

08:36.183 --> 08:39.052
I mapped out Winter's routine
from Hynes's file.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.520
The place where I chose
to grab him

08:40.554 --> 08:41.755
is right in the middle
of Bay Area Memorial's

08:41.789 --> 08:42.756
catchment area.

08:42.790 --> 08:43.857
My domain.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.058
That the fuck.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.160
You got lucky.
I did--

08:47.194 --> 08:49.096
I made a plan,
and it worked.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.497
So what happened
to your face?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.099
Wade Pardo. Showed up,

08:52.132 --> 08:53.901
cold-cocked me
outside the hospital.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.403
Guess he made a plan,
and his plan worked.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.905
He was wearing a jump suit

08:57.938 --> 09:00.741
with Tyerman's Oil Change
and Glass on the back.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.676
(laughing): He's wearing this
when he hit you?

09:02.710 --> 09:03.944
Awesome.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.913
He hasn't gotten
much smarter.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.516
Where are you going?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.285
Well, you know, car's been
running a little rough.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.887
Thought I might take it
for an oil change.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.056
Better idea is you take
a couple deep breaths

09:16.089 --> 09:18.091
while I get you
some fucking water.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.360
You know what, D?
I'm not thirsty.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.729
Well, what the fuck
are you, doc?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.330
Because you're something.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.968
Okay.
Forget Wade Pardo.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.904
If this Winter Guy is doing
what Hynes says he is,

09:30.938 --> 09:32.606
he's gonna keep going.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.741
He's got to be stopped.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.808
We have to stop him.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.409
Here's the deal.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.612
I don't get a hammer on this cop
pretty fucking soon,

09:38.646 --> 09:40.047
I'm going back to plan "A."

09:40.080 --> 09:41.048
Which is...?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.282
Stab him in the eye.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.217
Or stab you in the eye.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.253
And, honestly,
I could get the drop on you

09:46.286 --> 09:48.555
way fucking easier.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.890
(cellphone chimes)

09:49.923 --> 09:52.760
Okay. There.
"Download complete."

09:54.261 --> 09:56.764
So, what do I do
if I want to start this up?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.666
Do I press the--
the, uh...?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.100
God.
You're so Amish.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.303
Just go to the app,
hit the arrow.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.972
Magic.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.307
Why do you make me feel
like a chimp

10:07.340 --> 10:10.177
fishing for termites
with a stick?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.479
When I was a kid,
we didn't have all this stuff.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.781
You've got
an unfair advantage.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.315
I know, Dad.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.818
When you were growing up,
this was all orange groves.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.352
Orange groves,

10:19.386 --> 10:22.890
woolly mammoths trapped
in primordial ooze.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.427
You look extra pretty today.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.998
Hmm.
Well, so do you.

10:31.031 --> 10:35.368
Yeah, this is why you should not
read and walk at the same time.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.504
No, but driving
and lying's okay.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.375
I will try
to be more careful.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.946
Let me know how that goes.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.815
(seatbelt clicks)

10:50.684 --> 10:52.052
Oh, love you.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.787
(door closes)

10:53.821 --> 10:55.388
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.524
(indistinct conversation)
(school bell rings)

10:57.557 --> 11:00.560
**

11:00.593 --> 11:03.463
(indistinct announcement
over P.A. system)

11:03.496 --> 11:05.232
LYNDSAY:
Do I need to do something?

11:05.265 --> 11:06.399
I can.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.735
WINTER: Like what?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.469
What would you do?
Well... (scoffs)

11:09.502 --> 11:11.138
You can't stay here,
for one thing.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.706
I mean...

11:12.740 --> 11:14.074
WINTER: It's fine for now,
Lyndsay.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.209
I will let you know
when it isn't.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.378
(sighs)

11:18.411 --> 11:20.280
Your doctor's here.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.852
I'll check back in
with you later.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.488
Mr. Winter.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.891
Much improved
since last we spoke.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.561
Eldon Chance.
Neuropsychiatry.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.997
We met briefly in the ER.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.733
You were the one who stopped
them from restraining me.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.835
That's right.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.104
Well, you seem
to be well-oriented,

11:44.137 --> 11:45.238
laying down new memories.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.373
That's a good sign.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.441
So it's just this, then?

11:48.475 --> 11:51.845
That and your current
emotional state.

11:51.879 --> 11:58.185
You were attacked by a stranger,
targeted for whatever reason.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.921
You could have been hurt
a lot worse.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.690
Rear choke like that
for longer than 40 seconds,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.358
and you wouldn't be here.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.061
You'd be
in the county morgue.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.063
So when you think about that,

12:10.097 --> 12:11.598
how do you feel?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.600
You feel anxious?

12:13.633 --> 12:16.837
Vulnerable?
Depressed?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.075
Um...

12:22.109 --> 12:24.111
Yes, yes and yes.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.482
Plus, pissed off.

12:29.516 --> 12:33.086
Hmm. Rage.
Absolutely.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.654
If you'd indulge me
for a moment,

12:34.687 --> 12:38.091
I have some pictures
that I'd like to show you.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.596
Tell me what you see.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.432
Bad art.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.935
What's it supposed to be?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.270
It's called
a projection test.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.807
Gives me some sense of how
you're feeling about the world.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.512
One of us in this room
is brilliant,

12:59.546 --> 13:02.349
and the other
is just thorough.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.851
I know who you are,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.318
I know what you've done
with your life.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.120
I just want to make sure
that we're doing

13:07.154 --> 13:10.858
everything that we can to see
that your brain is okay.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.792
Now, what do you see?

13:13.994 --> 13:16.529
She looks spooked.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.532
He looks... perverted.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.105
And this tells you what,
exactly?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.974
It goes to state of mind.

13:27.007 --> 13:30.377
You know, what kinds of stories
you might be telling yourself

13:30.410 --> 13:35.182
in the wake of the attack,
versus, say, a month from now.

13:35.215 --> 13:39.052
So, I'll have to do this again,
you're saying?

13:39.086 --> 13:40.653
It's a possibility.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.322
Okay.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.660
The radiologist last night
said something about

13:47.694 --> 13:52.532
a Victims of Violent Crime Unit
at this hospital.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.736
She said that because
of what happened to me,

13:56.769 --> 14:00.974
I would automatically be
entitled to treatment there,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.977
therapy or counseling
or whatever.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.147
Is this part of that?
Uh, no.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.050
Uh, um, I'm actually
on the staff there, but no.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.418
This is different.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.020
But I-I don't have to do it,
do I?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.221
It's not mandatory?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.522
This is absolutely
not mandatory.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.990
Nobody's
gonna make me do it.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.358
No.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.565
But you work there, huh?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.534
Wow.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.670
What attracts you to victims
of violent crime?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.739
Helping them, you mean.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.910
Giving them back
their power.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.811
That's amazing.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.784
One of us in this room
is a very good man.

14:44.817 --> 14:50.357
**

14:50.390 --> 14:52.292
How about this?

14:56.763 --> 14:59.799
(chuckles)

14:59.832 --> 15:02.302
Well,
he's got it coming.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.371
In what way?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.472
Well, look at him,

15:05.505 --> 15:09.609
sitting there, head down.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.478
He's guilty of something.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.213
Nobody had to take him
to the woodshed.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.182
He's waiting there already.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.818
Waiting to be punished,
then.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.787
You asked what I thought.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.190
**

15:27.927 --> 15:29.429
(spoon clatters)

15:29.462 --> 15:32.232
(sighs)

15:32.265 --> 15:34.667
**

15:40.607 --> 15:44.011
You have to stop
showing me this shit.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.945
Yeah.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.615
I don't disagree.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.450
Something about
the black and white, maybe.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.952
No, something about
what they fucking are!

15:54.654 --> 15:57.790
Don't show me pictures
of lonely, pathetic people.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.392
What's wrong with you?

16:01.061 --> 16:05.465
You said you want to give people
their power back, right?

16:05.498 --> 16:09.869
Well, do you actually know
what it feels like to lose it,

16:09.902 --> 16:11.438
much less have it taken

16:11.471 --> 16:15.375
by some asshole coward
in the fucking dark?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.815
I think I need
to lie down for a while.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.051
Please excuse me.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.652
Sure.

16:28.921 --> 16:32.392
Well, I-I'll check back.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.861
**

16:37.497 --> 16:39.899
**

16:42.535 --> 16:45.038
CHANCE:
Patient exhibited agitation,

16:45.072 --> 16:47.707
particularly in response
to card number three.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.710
Collective reaction was one
of increasing irritability

16:50.743 --> 16:52.379
bordering on anger,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.481
followed by a refusal
to continue.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.551
Could be the result
of being attacked from behind.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.188
Or feelings of aggression

17:01.221 --> 17:03.723
aroused by the sight
of a vulnerable woman.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.258
(door opens)

17:05.292 --> 17:06.926
LUCY:
Hi. I'm coming in.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.196
I have the files
that you asked for.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.797
Just put them down there.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.900
(telephone rings)

17:13.933 --> 17:15.902
What happened there?
You get into a fight?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.371
Yep.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.941
Well, all right, then.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.043
Uh, these aren't
your patients.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.613
Are their cases transferring
to you?

17:26.646 --> 17:27.614
Not yet.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.015
Sounds suspicious.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.051
Yeah, I-I just got interested
in the MCMIs.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.887
I wanted to see
if our patients' psych profiles

17:34.921 --> 17:36.923
showed a shift after
going through our program.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.259
Oh, man.
(chuckles)

17:39.292 --> 17:41.060
I haven't seen these
since college.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.396
Yeah. I just tried those out
on a patient.

17:43.430 --> 17:48.568
Is your patient an evil,
old-timey, serial-killer clown?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.870
They're just, you know,
really old school

17:50.903 --> 17:53.306
for psychological profiling,
aren't they?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.275
You know what else
is old school?

17:55.308 --> 17:57.377
Awesome things that work.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.646
(indistinct chatter)

18:01.148 --> 18:03.049
(P.A. system chimes)

18:03.082 --> 18:06.586
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Warren
to the Center for a psych eval.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.921
Dr. Warren to the Center
for a psych eval.

**

18:10.623 --> 18:12.159
Excuse me.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.394
Have you seen the patient
that was in this room?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.462
Ryan Winter?

18:15.495 --> 18:16.796
No. Sorry.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.831
I'm looking
at the schedule now.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.433
I'm thinking
Thursday night.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.802
Just need someone here
Thursday night to cover.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.637
(keyboard clacking)

18:24.671 --> 18:26.673
(indistinct conversations)

18:29.809 --> 18:32.645
And I have,
uh, two more.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.846
MAN: And...
(woman exhales)

18:33.880 --> 18:35.014
...we're done.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.583
Crisis averted.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.418
WOMAN: You should go.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.320
I can call a nurse
if I need help.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.622
MAN: And have them beat
our best bathroom time?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.657
Excuse me.

**

18:47.194 --> 18:48.861
What are you doing?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.832
Come on.
Let's get you back to your room.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.501
Come on.
Come on.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.669
Is he supposed to be here?
What's he doing?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.004
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.173
Excuse us.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.977
You all right?

19:05.011 --> 19:07.046
You look like you might
be feeling light-headed.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.315
I wanted to hear them,

19:08.348 --> 19:11.017
I mean,
really hear them.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.653
It made me feel
kind of like you.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.388
In what way?

19:15.422 --> 19:16.956
Seeing who a person is

19:16.989 --> 19:18.825
and they don't even know
you're looking.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.296
They don't know
they should hide or how.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.797
That's eavesdropping.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.199
That's not what I do.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.934
Also, I get consent.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.671
Do you, though?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.039
(indistinct announcement
over P.A. system)

19:33.072 --> 19:34.407
If someone has no idea

19:34.441 --> 19:35.842
what you're going to find
inside them,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.577
how can they really
consent?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.412
Well, they can't,
exactly.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.180
Not in the way you mean.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.216
But they want to know
what's in there,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.384
and they have to trust me.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.553
And they can trust me.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.221
You could, too.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.191
I think I'm going
to leave.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.427
Leave?

19:54.461 --> 19:55.495
The hospital.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.896
I'd like to be discharged.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.531
If that's not up to you,
maybe you could talk

19:58.565 --> 20:00.600
to the person
it is up to, please.

What? Are you kidding me?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.458
NICOLE:
I think he secretly did.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.960
And then I ran home.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.228
You ran home?
(laughs)

20:29.262 --> 20:30.697
Did you get what you...

20:30.730 --> 20:33.266
Wow!
You're driving a party bus now.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.434
What's going on?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.602
Nothing.
Do we have any KFC left?

Uh, nothing?

Jason Spencer
is not nothing.
Okay, no, no, no.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.073
Okay. You know, I need
to talk about this.
Come on.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.875
Jason Spencer...
listen to this.
(laughing): Oh, stop!

20:42.909 --> 20:46.078
Jason Spencer, the hottest boy
of the entire junior class,

20:46.112 --> 20:47.647
is totally hitting
on your daughter,

20:47.680 --> 20:49.449
and she's being
a total freak about it.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.117
Oh, my God.
He's my lab partner.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.552
Oh, my God. So?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.653
It's not like you guys
are cousins.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.087
Look.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.623
No, no, no,
look at this.
Stop!

20:56.656 --> 20:57.957
Look at this.
It's cute. Don't worry.

20:57.990 --> 20:58.958
Ah.
Yeah, there they are.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.427
I saw him.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.728
This morning, when I dropped
you off at school.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.095
He was waiting for you.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.397
PEPPER:
Cute couple, right?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.165
And she is totally
leading him on.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.134
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.470
Oh, and not to mention the fact
that half the girls at school

21:10.503 --> 21:12.104
are jealous of her
because of it.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.173
Huge way to make an entrance
to a new school, girl.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.976
He looks sweet.
Mm-hmm.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.446
Maybe you should
have him over.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.348
Maybe for dinner.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.515
PEPPER (whispers):
Great idea.
Yeah.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.784
The four of us
could have dinner.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.721
The things I hate in order
right now are you, you, and you.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.691
Cool. I'm gonna go upstairs

21:31.724 --> 21:33.860
and find that romper
you're lending me.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.431
I know what you're thinking.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.132
We're not thinking anything.
No, we're not...

21:40.166 --> 21:42.134
It's nice that you've found
someone you like.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.936
You're worried.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.105
No. We're not.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.674
We're not.

21:47.707 --> 21:51.277
It's okay. I get it.
But this is not that.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.513
It's different.
I'm all right.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.349
Nothing's weird or...
like before.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.450
I'm not leading him on.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.552
I'm not making an entrance.

21:59.586 --> 22:00.553
I'm not doing anything.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.656
I'm just... figuring it out,

22:03.690 --> 22:05.925
like everybody else does,
okay?

22:07.494 --> 22:09.996
CHRISTINA:
That sounds like a plan.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.964
Everybody cool, then?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.065
So cool.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.575
What happened to your face?

22:22.609 --> 22:24.744
(door closes)
I, um-- There was a...

22:24.777 --> 22:28.915
You know what? I, for one,
am totally excited about this.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.383
I'm encouraged by it.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.318
You know, she's not
rushing into anything.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.254
I-I-I think she's learning
from her mistakes.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.524
Well, it's life.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.459
She can't hide from life.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.595
(indistinct conversations)

22:42.629 --> 22:44.631

23:34.514 --> 23:36.215
That looks like
some bomb-ass scat.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.385
Fuck off, buddy.
For real.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.419
Come on.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.121
Help a brother out.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.760
That help?

23:50.797 --> 23:52.231
Shit.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.179
(cellphone rings)

24:10.983 --> 24:13.653
Hynes.
Hey, what's up?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.623
I can't--
I can't really hear you.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.290
It's pretty windy
where you are.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.193
You're what?

24:22.629 --> 24:25.532
Are you--
Are you sure?

24:25.565 --> 24:28.501
Y-Yeah, but that kind of ring's
pretty common, though.

24:31.738 --> 24:34.507
No, no, no.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.843
Where exactly
in the Headlands?

24:36.876 --> 24:38.444
Uh, I won't.
I promise, Sid.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.146
Look, Sid, thank you.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.848
Thank you.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.197
Hey.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.165
(door closes)

25:33.199 --> 25:34.667
Yes.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.503
As a matter of fact,
that is Ryan Winter.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.772
I see that.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.440
How'd that happen?

25:41.473 --> 25:43.242
He was here waiting
when I got in this morning.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.877
Seemed pretty enthusiastic,

25:44.911 --> 25:47.513
so I figured you wouldn't mind
if I did the intake.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.548
No, of course not.

25:49.582 --> 25:50.783
Just surprised.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.084
When he left,
he never said anything

25:52.118 --> 25:54.553
about taking advantage
of services.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.255
Yeah.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.590
I would have figured
someone

25:57.624 --> 25:59.892
with his resources
would go private.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.561
But his main point
of contact here was you,

26:02.595 --> 26:05.131
and he's a pretty smart guy,
if you hadn't noticed,

26:05.164 --> 26:07.233
so I'm sure he realizes
he can spend his money,

26:07.266 --> 26:09.201
but it won't get him
a better doctor.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.437
That is a really nice thing
to say.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.572
I am a really nice person.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.744
Cool bruise.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.546
Went with the shirt.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.414
Anyway, good luck.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.251
Winter can buy this whole
hospital with pocket change,

26:25.284 --> 26:29.288
but don't let that
intimidate you.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.124

26:32.158 --> 26:34.060
(door opens)

26:34.093 --> 26:36.595
(indistinct conversation)

26:39.766 --> 26:42.434
CARL: Ah, D.
That gold leaf has come in.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.971
You can finish
this French Empire piece now.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.473
In the morning.
Right now, I need your help.

26:47.506 --> 26:48.507
Are you in trouble?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.942
That remains to be seen.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.011
I'm doing a recon op
for the doc.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.180
Tracking Hynes.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.482
I need you to do
a little sneak and peek.

26:56.515 --> 27:00.186
You want me to spy
on Detective Hynes?

27:00.219 --> 27:04.123
Yep. He's been holed up
in a bar for over an hour.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.692
Why can't you do it?

27:05.725 --> 27:08.995
Uh, the place is small.
I'd stand out.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.597
This op is already
on the verge of compromise.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.265
Is it possible
that Detective Hynes

27:13.299 --> 27:16.669
could recognize me from that
accident and those Romanians?

27:16.703 --> 27:19.105
That's phantom shit.
You're clean.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.507
But if you're worried,
put on your best battle rattle.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.043
If anyone can make shit
look different, it's you.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.315
Okay.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.684
DENNIS: I'm trying to move on
like she'd want.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.853
Millie took care of everything.

27:33.886 --> 27:37.056
I don't even know
the PIN for our debit card.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.826
Customer came in the other day,

27:39.859 --> 27:42.661
and I was counting back
his change.

27:42.695 --> 27:46.398
(voice breaking): And suddenly,
I couldn't even tell

27:46.432 --> 27:50.636
the difference between
the quarters and the dimes.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.240
I could see them,
but I couldn't...

27:54.273 --> 27:57.643
I couldn't.
I...

27:57.676 --> 28:02.414
(sobbing)

28:02.448 --> 28:05.217
Dennis, what you're experiencing
is very common.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.553
It's a version of Complex PTSD.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.521
You think
that because you're not

28:09.555 --> 28:12.258
actively recalling the robbery
that you're not re-experiencing

28:12.291 --> 28:14.560
the emotions you had
when it happened, but you are.

28:14.593 --> 28:17.529
You think you're just counting
a customer's change,

28:17.563 --> 28:19.431
but you're doing it
in the store

28:19.465 --> 28:21.267
that you built with your wife.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.869
The store that was robbed,

28:22.902 --> 28:25.037
where you were shot
and almost died

28:25.071 --> 28:26.906
and your wife did die.

28:26.939 --> 28:31.410
Those associations are more
than powerful enough

28:31.443 --> 28:32.711
to make you forget
the difference

28:32.745 --> 28:34.914
between dimes and quarters.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.448
Go easy on yourself,

28:36.482 --> 28:38.918
and eventually, I promise you,

28:38.951 --> 28:42.254
dimes will be dimes,
quarters will be quarters again.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.728
(pen clicks)

28:49.762 --> 28:53.232
Josefa, how's it going?

28:53.265 --> 28:56.302
Want to give us
a progress report?

28:56.335 --> 28:59.038
He caught me
wearing makeup.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.141
My husband, Ronny.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.879
I always take it off after work,
but this time, I didn't.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.481
Maybe I wanted him
to see.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.417
Maybe it was my way
of standing up to him.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.451
I don't know.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.253
Anyway, uh,

29:14.286 --> 29:19.458
he dragged me into the bathroom
and threw me into the tub.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.428
My head bounced off the tile.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.497
He turned on the shower
as hot as it would go.

29:27.633 --> 29:32.104
Then he...
took a Brillo pad

29:32.138 --> 29:34.306
to scrape
the makeup off.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.977
Funny thing is,

29:38.010 --> 29:42.882
I had to use makeup on Monday
for work to cover it up.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.988
Why don't you leave him?

29:49.021 --> 29:51.090
No. Ryan.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.259
In group therapy, someone has
the floor, we don't interrupt.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.061
No,
I want to answer him.

29:57.796 --> 30:02.001
I've got kids, okay?

30:02.034 --> 30:05.604
I stay for them.

30:05.637 --> 30:09.208
I live with it for them,

30:09.241 --> 30:15.281
'cause I know if I stay,
he won't kill me.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.716
**

30:20.887 --> 30:22.688
I envy you.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.393
At least you know
who to be scared of.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.297
(sighs)

30:31.330 --> 30:33.732
I just...

30:33.765 --> 30:37.069
I think there's, um,
some comfort in knowing.

30:39.371 --> 30:45.878
I never saw mine or even
heard him, my attacker.

30:45.912 --> 30:49.648
One minute, I was walking,
and then everything went black.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.051
**

30:54.853 --> 30:56.755
Okay.
(clears throat)

30:58.390 --> 31:01.593
Uh, Alex,
do you want to...?

31:01.627 --> 31:04.263
When I was a kid,

31:04.296 --> 31:06.832
a baby bird fell
out of its nest

31:06.865 --> 31:09.035
onto the sidewalk
in front of our house.

31:09.068 --> 31:12.004
So I took it and put it
in a shoebox

31:12.038 --> 31:14.506
and gave it water
through an eye dropper

31:14.540 --> 31:16.175
and fed it
little bits of bread.

31:16.208 --> 31:21.013
But it just seemed
determined to die.

31:21.047 --> 31:24.216
My mother said that I was
delaying the inevitable,

31:24.250 --> 31:28.955
so she took it and drowned it
in a bucket of water.

31:28.988 --> 31:33.792
And I remember it looked
very peaceful after she, um...

31:37.429 --> 31:43.302
But we're all baby birds here,
in a way, aren't we?

31:43.335 --> 31:47.873
Fallen out of our nests,
lying on the sidewalk,

31:47.906 --> 31:49.475
not knowing who's coming

31:49.508 --> 31:55.314
or if they're gonna feed us
or drown us.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.284
It's terrifying.

31:58.317 --> 32:02.721
It is.
It's... It's terrifying.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.723
(light jazz piano music
plays on stereo)

32:04.756 --> 32:07.826
(door opens, closes)

32:12.464 --> 32:14.166
Vodka tonic with a twist,
please.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.467
BARTENDER:
You got it.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.809
(indistinct conversations)

32:23.842 --> 32:25.777
(pool balls clack)

32:28.647 --> 32:30.016
Here you go.
(glass thuds)

32:30.049 --> 32:31.817
Thank you.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.326
Brooks Brothers.
Hmm.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.463
Huh?

32:44.496 --> 32:46.865
Your blazer.
Brooks Brothers.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.703
So... So, what?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.508
A quality product.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.011
Sensible, versatile.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.646
A good cover.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.650
A good cover for what?

33:06.518 --> 33:09.255
For the cheap slacks
and shirt.

33:10.889 --> 33:15.461
Seriously, the jacket
is a piece of clothing

33:15.494 --> 33:17.163
that's worthy of scrutiny.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.331
No one will look past it
to what's underneath

33:19.365 --> 33:21.933
as long as the jacket makes
a good impression.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.906
You splurged on a classic
because you're sensible.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.975
And smart.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.311
You sound like an expert.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.413
Actually, I am.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.748
I'm a pattern maker
for a garment manufacturer.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.686
So you know your shit.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.155
Well, h-here's to you.

33:43.189 --> 33:46.992
I hope your company
values your work.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.361
I've been there 40 years.
(chuckles)

33:51.297 --> 33:53.399
It's not
the perfect situation,

33:53.432 --> 33:56.001
but I appreciate
their loyalty.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.837
Loyalty.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.573
Something from
a bygone era.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.242
(chuckles)

34:03.275 --> 34:07.413
I don't find
much of it myself these days.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.448
(piano music continues)

34:14.653 --> 34:18.757
I don't mean to pry,
but is something troubling you?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.228
No.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.263
I'm fine.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.865
It's just...

34:26.898 --> 34:30.936
I just lost someone who
meant something to me.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.272
I'm sorry.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.440
(ice rattles)

34:34.473 --> 34:36.375
Me, too.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.277
It's always difficult.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.578
Mm-hmm.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.314
Can I get you
another drink?

34:46.318 --> 34:48.254
Sure.
Why not?

34:50.956 --> 34:52.491
Can we have another round,
please?

34:52.524 --> 34:53.625
Sure.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.094
**

35:00.466 --> 35:03.702
You know, you--
you have one of those faces.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.607
What kind of faces?

35:08.640 --> 35:11.843
The kind that's vaguely
familiar.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.617
Brother, no one has ever accused
me of being vaguely anything.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.851
(chuckles)

35:21.853 --> 35:24.223
**

35:26.958 --> 35:29.328
**

35:32.030 --> 35:34.166
To your friend.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.635
**

35:38.237 --> 35:40.672
**

35:42.308 --> 35:44.009
Then he just took off,

35:44.042 --> 35:46.144
groceries in the cart,
middle of the fucking aisle.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.846
I had to run
to catch him.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.015
Bat out of hell,
out to the Headlands,

35:50.048 --> 35:51.583
all the way
to a crime scene.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.986
I couldn't get close enough
to see much,

35:55.020 --> 35:58.790
but I could tell they were
digging something up-- someone.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.160
First thought-- maybe that's
how this fucker gets off--

36:02.194 --> 36:05.697
kills people, goes back to
the crime scene to jack off.

36:05.731 --> 36:09.335
But then he starts crying,
and he bails.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.237
So I followed him to a bar.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.206
That's when I called Carl,
'cause it was his type of place.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.543
What do you mean?
You mean a gay bar?

36:17.576 --> 36:18.810
Hynes is gay?

36:18.844 --> 36:21.680
CARL:
Deeply closeted, but, yes.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.915
It was all very sad.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.717
He lost someone
very dear to him.

36:27.586 --> 36:28.987
Travis.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.358
Oh, he didn't mention a name,
not to me.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.093
But I could feel his loss.
His pain was palpable.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.095
Who the fuck is Travis?

36:37.128 --> 36:40.666
He was a confidential informant
of Hynes's.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.034
Some street kid got shot
in the head

36:43.068 --> 36:45.604
trying to break into a car
that belonged to Winter.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.707
Got himself out of the hospital
and disappeared.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.075
Until now, apparently.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.244
Oh, for fuck's sake.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.713
So Hynes has a boner
for some street kid who dies,

36:54.746 --> 36:56.081
and now he wants payback?

36:56.114 --> 36:57.616
D, this is not
about a boner.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.919
The man's a human being
with a broken heart,

37:00.952 --> 37:02.087
and you know better.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.390
Speaking of boners,

37:04.423 --> 37:06.758
Winter got one in group therapy

37:06.792 --> 37:08.360
while one of my patients
was describing

37:08.394 --> 37:10.028
in excruciating detail

37:10.061 --> 37:12.564
a physical abuse her husband
had inflicted on her.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.732
I know 20 scumbags

37:13.765 --> 37:16.402
get hard
for ugly shit like that.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.969
You want my advice?

37:18.003 --> 37:20.472
Drop it and find something
we can hold over Hynes

37:20.506 --> 37:23.241
'cause I am this close
to going back to plan "A."

37:23.275 --> 37:25.744
No, no, no,
plan "A" has got to wait.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.879
I have
domain specificity here, D.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.215
That's your term.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.217
I got Winter
right where I want him.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.053
He's on my turf, my rules.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.056
Chinks in the man's armor
are starting to show.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.591
I can feel it.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.760
There's more to come.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.430
I got to go through
with this, D.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.998
We have to go through with this
no matter what you say.

37:50.436 --> 37:53.439
How close am I to getting
punched in the face right now?

37:58.310 --> 38:01.847
Want to go punch
Wade Pardo instead?

38:01.880 --> 38:06.318
The 47 percent spike
in car break-ins city-wide

38:06.352 --> 38:09.287
is probably
why Tyerman's Oil and Glass

38:09.321 --> 38:11.089
stays open till midnight
these days.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.424
I called.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.361
Wade is on the late shift.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.595
What do you say?

38:16.628 --> 38:20.366
(slurping)

38:20.399 --> 38:22.300
(cup thuds)

38:25.170 --> 38:26.505
(door opens)

38:26.538 --> 38:28.940
CHANCE:
When Wade Pardo attacked him,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.776
my patient Sam,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.878
been to a restaurant
in North Beach,

38:32.911 --> 38:34.480
dinner with his boyfriend.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.882
They'd been together
ten months.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.652
This was the first time they'd
ever held hands in public.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.388
For Wade Pardo...

38:42.421 --> 38:44.490
**

38:44.523 --> 38:46.725
You need some glass
replaced.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.963
(brakes squeak)

38:51.997 --> 38:53.198
(parking brake engages)

38:53.231 --> 38:54.466
(engine shuts off)

38:54.500 --> 38:56.902
**

38:59.538 --> 39:02.374
MAN: You the guy
who just called?
I am.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.742
I only got one guy
on shift tonight,

39:03.775 --> 39:05.176
but I can probably
take care of you myself,

39:05.210 --> 39:06.378
depending on what
we're talking about.

39:06.412 --> 39:09.080
That's great.
It's uh...

39:09.114 --> 39:10.982
Let me check my stock.
I'll-I'll be right back.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.918
All right.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.755
(tools clanking)

39:16.788 --> 39:19.190
**

39:24.229 --> 39:26.598
**

39:31.703 --> 39:34.105
**

39:38.644 --> 39:39.878
(bones crack)
Aah!

39:39.911 --> 39:42.313
**

39:43.549 --> 39:45.951
**

39:47.152 --> 39:49.855
(tools clatter)

39:49.888 --> 39:52.223
**

39:55.627 --> 39:58.063
**

40:00.065 --> 40:01.933
I got that replacement
in stock.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.570
You want to give me
an hour?

40:04.603 --> 40:07.238
Uh, you know what?
It's getting kind of late.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.240
Maybe I can last
another day.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.476
All right.
I'm here tomorrow.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.410
Okay.
All right.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.846
**

40:17.616 --> 40:19.117
(keys clack)

40:19.150 --> 40:22.187
(engine starts)

40:24.155 --> 40:27.459
So, are you guys going, too?
Oh, yeah.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.260
See you.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.929
NICOLE:
Hey. Jason.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.233
So, it sounds pretty fun.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.936
Friday night?
The musical at USF?

40:37.969 --> 40:39.805
Yeah, um...

40:39.838 --> 40:41.673
I'm not, um...

40:41.707 --> 40:43.975
I'm probably
not gonna be going after all.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.577
Oh.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.345
A few of us might do

40:47.378 --> 40:49.948
this other thing instead,
so I don't know.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.017
Sure.
That's cool.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.351
Is everything okay?

40:55.887 --> 40:58.524
Yeah, um...

40:58.557 --> 41:00.526
You know, shit came up.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.160
Yeah, no, I get it.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.863
You're...
You're just acting weird.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.699
I don't know
if it's gonna work.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.335
What... isn't?

41:14.706 --> 41:16.675
I got to go.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.483
PEPPER: Hey.

41:25.517 --> 41:28.687
Jason just totally
flaked on me over nothing.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.856
I mean, it's not a big deal.
I barely talk to him.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.825
Yeah, um, I don't know
if it's exactly about nothing.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.827
Well, what the fuck
does that mean?

41:35.861 --> 41:37.663
People have been talking.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.131
Like, Jason and them.

41:40.165 --> 41:44.002
Something they heard about that
happened at your old school?

41:44.035 --> 41:47.472
Look. Whatever it is,
it's out there.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.840
So...

41:52.043 --> 41:54.345
HYNES:
So you're saying you came up
behind him

41:54.379 --> 41:57.215
and choked him out?
I mean, where'd you learn
a ninja move like that?

41:57.248 --> 41:59.517
I mean-- I mean,
it's fucking crazy

41:59.551 --> 42:03.254
to even picture it,
but I like it.

42:03.288 --> 42:06.157
You know,
you're a special onion, doc.

42:06.191 --> 42:10.896
Speaking of crazy,
you lied to me.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.430
About what?

42:12.463 --> 42:13.999
The fact
that you were transferred

42:14.032 --> 42:17.535
from SFPD to Fremont,
and why.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.839
How the fuck
do you know that?

42:20.872 --> 42:22.941
Winter didn't
orchestrate that.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.777
It was
a mental health issue.

42:25.811 --> 42:29.180
You had a breakdown.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.249
That's none
of your business.

42:31.282 --> 42:34.753
No, see, it kind of is my
business because you lied to me.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.287
You lied to me
to force me into this.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.289
Too bad.

42:38.323 --> 42:41.059
You get your hands dirty,
you give people leverage,

42:41.092 --> 42:42.227
and they work you.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.929
So I worked you.

42:48.133 --> 42:50.135
You blackmailed me.

42:50.168 --> 42:51.603
Well, if blackmailing
turns you on,

42:51.637 --> 42:53.371
then let's call it that,
okay?

42:53.404 --> 42:54.806
But here's the truth.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.708
The truth is the job
won't let me take

42:56.742 --> 42:59.978
this sick, murdering fuck
down the aboveboard way,

43:00.011 --> 43:02.648
so I'm doing
what needs to be done.

43:05.016 --> 43:08.386
(sighs)

43:08.419 --> 43:10.221
What's this shit?

43:10.255 --> 43:14.660
Our entire conversation
is now in the cloud.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.727
Don't ask me how.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.162
You're recording us?

43:17.195 --> 43:19.064
(chuckling)
Okay.

43:19.097 --> 43:22.500
So, you've got a hammer
over me,

43:22.533 --> 43:24.435
now I have one over you.

43:24.469 --> 43:26.772
Mutually assured destruction.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.744
Ah, congratulations, doc,

43:32.778 --> 43:36.414
but you got to be prepared
to use it.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.649
(cellphone thuds)

43:37.683 --> 43:39.851
And I don't think
you will.

43:39.885 --> 43:41.486
But you lied to me
about something else.

43:41.519 --> 43:42.788
Really?
Travis.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.826
You were in love with him.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.161
You watch
your fucking step, doc.

43:50.195 --> 43:53.131
Okay, okay. I...
Don't fuck with me.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.933
Listen, I don't care.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.302
I don't care
about your personal life.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.671
The fact
that you're heartbroken

43:59.705 --> 44:01.606
and that's affecting your
judgment about Winter,

44:01.639 --> 44:03.141
that matters to me.

44:04.509 --> 44:06.878
I don't even want to think about

44:06.912 --> 44:08.980
attacking an innocent person.

44:09.014 --> 44:11.516
He's not innocent shit!
All right.

44:11.549 --> 44:13.719
But if you keep pushing,

44:13.752 --> 44:16.154
I'm gonna take away
the one thing you have

44:16.187 --> 44:17.989
that you still
care about:

44:18.023 --> 44:20.859
your job,

44:20.892 --> 44:23.094
no matter what
the blowback is on me.

44:25.396 --> 44:28.199
You don't know
what you're doing.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.068
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.170
I'm leaving.

44:43.448 --> 44:47.018
Uh-huh. Yes.

44:47.052 --> 44:48.386
I sent them over.

44:48.419 --> 44:51.322
Mm-hmm.
Bye.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.158
Yeah.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.393
All right, so,
if you can only do them,

44:55.426 --> 44:57.829
do the first 20, then.

44:57.863 --> 44:59.164
All right.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.266
Josefa didn't show.

45:01.299 --> 45:03.701
Did she call?

45:03.735 --> 45:05.703
(binder thuds)
Nope.

45:05.737 --> 45:08.106
Can you call her?

45:09.808 --> 45:11.609
And if her husband answers
or you have to leave a message,

45:11.642 --> 45:13.344
you're the, uh...

45:13.378 --> 45:15.280
Calling from Dr. Diamond's
gynecological practice

45:15.313 --> 45:16.714
about a missed appointment.

45:16.748 --> 45:18.349
I remember everything
about everything.

45:18.383 --> 45:19.785
No doubt.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.590
Her voicemail's full.

45:27.793 --> 45:29.294
What are you doing?

45:32.630 --> 45:34.933
Maybe I'll go by there.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.437
I'm gonna go over there.
Can you write down her address?

45:40.605 --> 45:42.273
MAN: Again tomorrow.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.112
(vehicles passing)

45:47.145 --> 45:50.115
(door closes)

45:50.148 --> 45:51.416
(horn honks in distance)

45:51.449 --> 45:53.251
**

45:53.284 --> 45:56.621
Hey.
I was just coming to see you.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.458
I've only got a minute.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.794
If we're talking,
we should probably talk

46:02.828 --> 46:03.929
about whether group therapy

46:03.962 --> 46:06.164
is really the right step
for you.

46:06.197 --> 46:09.134
Those cards you showed me,
the, um...

46:09.167 --> 46:11.602
the picture interpretation
technique.

46:11.636 --> 46:14.973
I discovered they have
kind of a...

46:15.006 --> 46:17.943
kind of a darker purpose
than you implied.

46:19.010 --> 46:21.279
Does that upset you?

46:22.613 --> 46:25.150
It does, and it doesn't.

46:25.183 --> 46:27.185
You said you wanted a sense
of how I see the world,

46:27.218 --> 46:29.187
and what you were
really trying to do

46:29.220 --> 46:31.022
was get at my unconscious.

46:31.056 --> 46:33.791
Pretty much exactly
what you scolded me for,

46:33.825 --> 46:38.496
peering into my psyche
without consent.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.266
My domain, my hospital,
on the clock--

46:41.299 --> 46:43.301
I don't need your permission
for that.

46:43.334 --> 46:46.671
(siren wails in distance)
WINTER:
Right. You need my trust.

46:46.704 --> 46:48.840
You need my trust.

46:51.209 --> 46:54.545
And I want
to give it to you.

46:54.579 --> 46:57.182
I think it's possible
that I could be understood here.

46:57.215 --> 47:00.285
What about you is hard
for people to understand?

47:00.318 --> 47:04.822
The questions
I've always wanted to ask,

47:04.856 --> 47:08.393
I can imagine asking you.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.896
(police radio chatter)

47:12.497 --> 47:14.832
I very much want to continue
with the group.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.367
(car alarm engages)
WOMAN: Hey, honey.
Yeah, just got off.

47:16.401 --> 47:17.969
(woman continues speaking
indistinctly)

47:18.003 --> 47:19.704
**

47:19.737 --> 47:22.140
(police radio chatter)

47:22.173 --> 47:24.009
But I'm hoping
there's room in your schedule

47:24.042 --> 47:26.377
for one-on-one therapy,
as well.

47:26.411 --> 47:29.014
(woman crying)

47:30.381 --> 47:32.183
So you'll let me know...

47:34.352 --> 47:36.087
...about your schedule.

47:36.121 --> 47:38.556
**

47:40.125 --> 47:41.592
Who's Stevie?

47:41.626 --> 47:44.029
**

47:48.533 --> 47:49.767
When they brought you in,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.736
before they took you down
for the scan,

47:51.769 --> 47:53.905
you said
the name Stevie.

47:57.075 --> 47:59.044
Buckle up, doctor.

47:59.077 --> 48:03.148
I think we're going
on an adventure.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.785
**

48:11.456 --> 48:14.859
(police radio chatter)

48:14.892 --> 48:17.295
**

48:19.330 --> 48:21.499
POLICEMAN: Sorry, sir. You can't
be here.

48:24.002 --> 48:26.404
CHANCE:
I'm looking for Josefa Pefaur.

48:26.437 --> 48:29.140
I'm her psychiatrist. We had an
appointment. She didn't show.

48:29.174 --> 48:30.775
Is she inside?
Is she all right?

48:30.808 --> 48:35.613
I need you to go back
downstairs, sir, right now.

48:46.857 --> 48:48.859
**

49:16.887 --> 49:18.889

49:40.911 --> 49:42.880
