WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:03.754
Oh! It's Coach!

00:03.792 --> 00:05.164
Coach, our old roommate?

00:05.235 --> 00:06.535
He wants to hang out tonight.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.103
- What?
- He just texted me.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.706
Oh, man, you better give
Power of Attorney to a loved one,

00:10.740 --> 00:12.107
'cause it's about to get crazy.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.643
When Coach has the dice,
every roll's a seven.

00:14.678 --> 00:16.612
? Here I am ?

00:16.646 --> 00:20.115
? Rock you like a hurricane ?

00:20.150 --> 00:22.084
Nick, trumpet solo.

00:22.118 --> 00:23.652
Yeah!

00:23.687 --> 00:25.754
You're ruining my wedding!

00:25.789 --> 00:27.790
You know, I bet this means
he broke up with Malia.

00:27.824 --> 00:29.058
I mean, that's his thing.

00:29.092 --> 00:30.392
He finds a girl,
he just disappears.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.661
Holy crap in a hat! Schmidt!

00:32.695 --> 00:33.863
How long have you been
out there?

00:33.897 --> 00:36.799
Oh, relax. Just bringing my chimes
over to the new loft.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.301
Damn it, Schmidt! You're here
all the time taking our stuff.

00:39.336 --> 00:41.837
You decided to move out,
so get new stuff.

00:41.872 --> 00:44.573
Oh, I'm sorry that I'm more into material
possessions than you.

00:44.608 --> 00:46.709
Schmidt, you stole my toothpaste
while I was using it.

00:46.743 --> 00:47.877
That's vindictive.

00:47.911 --> 00:49.311
- That's who took the toothpaste?
- Yeah.

00:49.346 --> 00:51.280
Uh-oh, you better watch out,
break of, break of dawn,

00:51.314 --> 00:53.649
because I'm about
to party all up in you!

00:53.683 --> 00:55.084
- Coach texted you, too?
- Yeah, man.

00:55.118 --> 00:56.485
Well, I guess he doesn't realize

00:56.520 --> 00:57.920
you're a dill weed
who doesn't live here anymore.

00:57.954 --> 01:00.789
Well, I guess he doesn't realize
that you're a dill weed who...

01:00.824 --> 01:02.491
who still lives here.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.894
Remember when you got those chimes,
and there was that girl?

01:04.928 --> 01:06.695
Yeah.

01:06.730 --> 01:09.098
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I don't get it.

01:09.132 --> 01:10.699
I had so much sex on patio furniture.

01:10.734 --> 01:11.767
- A lot of fun.
- The best.

01:11.801 --> 01:14.104
- I'm still mad at you.
- I'm mad at you, man!

01:15.472 --> 01:17.640
I need everyone to shut up

01:17.674 --> 01:20.809
and answer
one... simple... question!

01:22.337 --> 01:25.510
You sons a bitches ready to party?

01:25.545 --> 01:26.782
Yeah!

01:26.816 --> 01:29.718
? Who's that girl? ?
? <i>Who's that girl?</i> ?

01:29.753 --> 01:31.186
? Who's that girl?

01:31.221 --> 01:32.819
? <i>Who's that girl?</i> ?
? It's Jess ?

01:33.756 --> 01:35.568
Good to have you back, old man.

01:35.603 --> 01:37.560
So, what, uh,
you and Malia broke up?

01:37.594 --> 01:40.596
Oh, yeah. She got real fat on me,
so I was, like, "Ew. Bye."

01:40.630 --> 01:43.065
I guess her gain is our gain!

01:43.099 --> 01:44.799
Who are you?

01:45.168 --> 01:47.534
- Hey, come... Come on, man.
- It's me, Jess.

01:47.537 --> 01:49.038
Ah, yeah, no.

01:49.072 --> 01:50.439
We lived together
for, like, two weeks.

01:50.473 --> 01:51.774
We shared
some pretty big moments.

01:51.808 --> 01:55.544
- Yes! We got Bin Laden!
- SEAL Team 6, bitches!

01:55.579 --> 01:57.279
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:57.314 --> 02:00.282
Huh.
I thought I was alone for that.

02:00.317 --> 02:01.850
- You weren't.
- Anyway,

02:01.885 --> 02:04.820
I'm single, and me and my boys
are gonna get crazy tonight!

02:04.854 --> 02:06.155
Huh?

02:06.189 --> 02:08.591
You know what I'm talking about,
Shrimp Forks.

02:08.625 --> 02:09.892
- Oh, man.
- Oh, no.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.560
What's Shrimp Forks?

02:11.595 --> 02:13.829
It's a name I gave Winston
when we played hoops.

02:13.863 --> 02:16.498
The ball used to always slip
through his little, small girly hands.

02:16.533 --> 02:18.400
Winston Bishop, point guard...

02:19.669 --> 02:22.171
Winston Bishop, point guard, R...

02:22.205 --> 02:23.405
Point guard, R...

02:23.440 --> 02:25.975
He couldn't palm an apple.
Old Shrimp Forks.

02:26.009 --> 02:28.010
So, I'm thinking strip club tonight?

02:28.044 --> 02:31.180
- Hmm?
- Oh, fun, fun! Fun! Fun!

02:31.214 --> 02:34.149
Uh, Nick, can I talk to you in
the other room alone for a sec?

02:35.384 --> 02:37.519
Should I close the door,
or do you want to just do it quietly?

02:37.554 --> 02:38.654
We're not having sex, Nick.

02:38.688 --> 02:39.922
No, I know that.

02:39.956 --> 02:41.490
- You wanted to come here and talk.
- Yeah.

02:41.524 --> 02:43.792
A strip club
on a Tuesday night?

02:43.827 --> 02:46.161
No, I know, I know, but this is
just what we always used to do.

02:46.196 --> 02:47.496
I don't want to be one
of those girls,

02:47.530 --> 02:49.632
but I feel kind of
uncomfortable about it.

02:49.666 --> 02:51.800
- I totally get it.
- Let's go, Nick.

02:51.835 --> 02:53.669
These dollar bills aren't gonna
stick themselves in a thong.

02:53.703 --> 02:54.970
I'm coming, my man.

02:55.005 --> 02:56.205
Right on.

02:56.239 --> 02:58.340
I might...
I might be coming, my man.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.187
- Oh, I get it. You're whipped.
- No, I'm not.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.878
I know you had to check in
with your girlfriend.

03:02.912 --> 03:04.913
We haven't even discussed
the girlfriend-boyfriend thing.

03:04.948 --> 03:06.415
Oh, cool, man. Let's go.

03:06.449 --> 03:08.350
What?

03:11.154 --> 03:12.287
What a...

03:12.322 --> 03:14.056
- I'm sorry, what did I just hear?
- What I...

03:14.090 --> 03:15.591
All I said was we haven't had

03:15.625 --> 03:17.459
the girlfriend-boyfriend discussion,
which we haven't.

03:17.494 --> 03:18.794
You don't think
you're my boyfriend?

03:18.828 --> 03:20.462
No, I never said that.

03:20.497 --> 03:21.563
I'm just talking terminology.

03:21.598 --> 03:23.165
We've never had the terminology.

03:23.199 --> 03:24.199
- We've never had the terminology.
- What?

03:24.234 --> 03:26.001
We've never used the terminology.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.302
It's funny you act like
you're my boyfriend,

03:27.303 --> 03:29.060
you have all the "privileges"
of being my boyfriend.

03:29.095 --> 03:29.838
I enjoy them.

03:29.873 --> 03:30.939
Would like me to revoke
those privileges?

03:30.974 --> 03:33.108
No, you're twisting my words.

03:33.143 --> 03:34.510
What I'm saying, Jess,

03:34.544 --> 03:36.378
is we've never had
the boyfriend-girlfriend,

03:36.413 --> 03:38.681
seeing other people conversation.

03:38.715 --> 03:41.083
We haven't had the seeing
other people conversation?

03:41.117 --> 03:42.851
You're seeing other people?

03:42.886 --> 03:44.219
No, I'm not. Are you?

03:44.254 --> 03:45.921
- No.
- Jess, I'm just...

03:45.955 --> 03:48.824
We haven't had
the conversation is all,

03:48.858 --> 03:50.092
and it's a conversation

03:50.126 --> 03:53.228
that I, personally,
would love to have.

03:53.263 --> 03:54.863
Uh, dude, let's go.
It's gonna close.

03:54.898 --> 03:56.598
Geez, is she not letting you go?

03:56.633 --> 03:59.401
I'm just telling her what kind
of cake to bake me, son.

03:59.436 --> 04:00.936
Oh.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.204
Damn!

04:02.238 --> 04:04.306
That's right. All right.

04:05.442 --> 04:06.675
What are you doing?!

04:06.710 --> 04:08.410
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?!

04:08.445 --> 04:09.778
Jess, it's when Coach is here,

04:09.813 --> 04:11.847
- I just...
- No.

04:11.881 --> 04:13.315
Nick!

04:13.349 --> 04:16.250
- I'm really sorry.
- Guess what, Nick?

04:16.286 --> 04:17.820
I'm going out tonight

04:17.853 --> 04:19.521
because we haven't had
the boyfriend-girlfriend talk,

04:19.555 --> 04:21.724
and we haven't had
the seeing other people talk,

04:21.757 --> 04:25.227
and I'm gonna bake a cake,
a pineapple upside down cake.

04:25.261 --> 04:26.995
- In terms of the metaphor, I'm really...
- Don't!

04:27.030 --> 04:28.330
Go to the strip club, Nick.

04:28.364 --> 04:29.698
Knock yourself out.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.900
Oh, don't wait up, Jebecca.

04:31.935 --> 04:32.968
Yeah, it's Jess.

04:33.002 --> 04:34.069
Right on.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.907
Men suck.

04:38.942 --> 04:40.776
- Nick isn't even a man.
- Mm-mm.

04:40.810 --> 04:44.613
He's like some man-boy,
man-child hybrid.

04:44.647 --> 04:47.916
The other day, I had to tell him
not to pull a dog's tail.

04:47.951 --> 04:49.818
I shouldn't have to do that.

04:49.853 --> 04:53.455
If a guy wants to play games, Jess,
you got to play them right back.

04:53.490 --> 04:54.823
- Right, good.
- Yeah.

04:54.858 --> 04:56.558
What does that mean?

04:56.593 --> 04:58.994
- I'd make him jealous.
- Yeah, right, yeah.

04:59.028 --> 05:00.696
And there are
a lot of guys out there

05:00.730 --> 05:01.997
that want to hook up with you.

05:02.031 --> 05:03.499
There is this one guy, Artie,

05:03.533 --> 05:05.467
from the coffee shop
who asked me out.

05:05.502 --> 05:06.935
Oh, actually,
you have my number.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.571
So give me a call.
Maybe we can go out sometime.

05:09.606 --> 05:11.740
Shut your face!

05:11.775 --> 05:14.309
You should maybe give this guy,
Artie, a call and see...

05:14.344 --> 05:15.644
No, that's too real.

05:15.678 --> 05:17.179
That's just way too real.

05:17.213 --> 05:18.580
Then why do you have his number
in your phone?

05:18.615 --> 05:20.115
I just like looking at it.
It's not weird.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.217
- No.
- But it has, like...

05:22.252 --> 05:24.820
a lot of fours in it.

05:24.854 --> 05:27.256
You know,
you know what I mean?

05:27.290 --> 05:29.124
No, I don't.

05:32.362 --> 05:34.797
Oh, which one of y'all
want a lap dance,

05:34.831 --> 05:37.633
because WB just hit the ATM.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.868
- Oh, hold up.
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.903 --> 05:41.270
Shrimp Forks, why'd you get
so much Bunny Money?

05:41.304 --> 05:42.337
What is Bunny Money?

05:42.372 --> 05:43.505
That is Bunny Money.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.941
That's not real money.
Look at the bill.

05:45.975 --> 05:47.776
President Rabbit
with two big ass jugs.

05:47.811 --> 05:50.312
Damn, man.

05:50.346 --> 05:52.648
It's fine. As long as you didn't
take out too much, you're okay.

05:52.682 --> 05:54.616
Hey, Schmidt,
I took out $2,000.

05:56.352 --> 05:58.453
You keep making mistakes,
Winston.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.422
Oh, isn't this great, guy?

06:00.456 --> 06:01.690
- Awesome.
- Yeah, man, the best.

06:01.724 --> 06:03.125
And it's gonna keep
getting better,

06:03.159 --> 06:05.664
because we're not leaving here
until the sun comes up.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.629
- Whew.
- Hey, yo, brick top!

06:07.664 --> 06:09.498
We about to get it popping.

06:09.532 --> 06:11.200
Whistle while you twerk!

06:12.368 --> 06:13.402
That man has so much confidence.

06:13.436 --> 06:14.603
It's amazing.

06:14.637 --> 06:15.838
Until the morning?
I can't do this, Schmidt.

06:15.872 --> 06:16.972
I'm having anxiety here.

06:17.006 --> 06:18.941
I have an 8:00 a.m. presentation.
That means

06:18.975 --> 06:21.276
I have to get there at 7:45
to lower everyone's chairs.

06:21.311 --> 06:22.945
Jess hasn't texted me back.
I'm starting to freak out.

06:22.979 --> 06:24.179
Here's what I think we should do.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.148
I think you should be the one
to just kind of tell him

06:26.182 --> 06:27.382
that we want to leave
and that maybe

06:27.417 --> 06:28.383
you want to leave
and then we'll all go together.

06:28.418 --> 06:29.818
Why do I have to be the heavy?

06:29.853 --> 06:30.986
All right, fellas!

06:31.020 --> 06:32.821
All right, he's back!

06:32.856 --> 06:34.423
So I got dancers for each of us,

06:34.457 --> 06:36.825
plus one floater to play the zone.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.360
Oh, defense!

06:38.394 --> 06:41.129
- Yeah!
- Here's a crazy idea.

06:41.164 --> 06:43.465
- Shoot, man.
- What if we got out of here,

06:43.499 --> 06:45.868
went back to the loft
and just hung out?

06:45.902 --> 06:48.103
You're going through a big breakup.
Let's talk it out, man.

06:48.137 --> 06:49.338
Yeah, yeah, let's just, um,

06:49.372 --> 06:50.739
go home and talk feelings.

06:50.773 --> 06:52.207
- No.
- Mm-mm.

06:52.242 --> 06:53.909
I was with Malia, now I'm not.

06:53.943 --> 06:55.677
There, we talked about it.

06:55.712 --> 06:57.079
Oh, look at the time.

06:57.113 --> 06:58.680
It's butt o'clock.

06:58.715 --> 06:59.948
- You whipped.
- Shut up, Schmidt.

06:59.983 --> 07:01.149
- You whipped.
- Straight-up whipped.

07:01.184 --> 07:02.251
I'm not whipped.

07:02.285 --> 07:03.418
- Whipped like cream cheese.
- Yeah, you are.

07:03.453 --> 07:05.287
- Whipped like cream cheese.
- Whipped!

07:05.321 --> 07:07.623
So, Cece, I'm thinking
of firing off this text to Nick.

07:07.657 --> 07:09.458
"Loving single life."

07:09.492 --> 07:11.960
Should I add a "whoo-hoo"
or is that too bitchy?

07:11.995 --> 07:13.795
Look who I called.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.831
Hey, Jess.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.868
Shut your face.

07:19.903 --> 07:21.403
What?

07:23.057 --> 07:25.536
Oh, looks like you could
use a new drink.

07:25.592 --> 07:29.361
Barkeep, can I please
get a Shirley Temple

07:29.395 --> 07:33.265
with a finger of coconut rum
and a lemon squeeze?

07:33.299 --> 07:35.734
I call it a Temple Grandin
because it makes friendly

07:35.768 --> 07:37.202
and compassionate.

07:37.236 --> 07:40.038
I have a boyfriend.

07:40.073 --> 07:41.373
No, she... No, she doesn't.

07:41.407 --> 07:42.741
Yeah, I do. She do.

07:42.775 --> 07:44.409
- No.
- Obviously, this is a bad time,

07:44.444 --> 07:46.578
and, uh, you're involved.

07:46.612 --> 07:47.646
In some shape or other.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.147
No, no, no.
She's free as a bird.

07:49.182 --> 07:50.215
- Cece.
- All right,

07:50.249 --> 07:52.851
well, he's a very lucky man.
I hope he realizes that.

07:52.885 --> 07:55.120
Oh, don't move.

07:55.154 --> 07:57.122
You've got an eyelash.

07:57.156 --> 07:59.057
There we go. Make a wish.

07:59.092 --> 08:00.959
I'm afraid to.

08:00.994 --> 08:03.061
All right, take care.

08:03.963 --> 08:05.230
Big mistake.

08:05.264 --> 08:07.065
I shook his hand. I had my fun.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.334
Do you think that Nick
is in the strip club right now

08:09.369 --> 08:11.336
shaking hands? No.

08:11.371 --> 08:13.338
Because he is a man.

08:13.373 --> 08:14.506
You can't trust them, Jess.

08:14.540 --> 08:16.742
Okay? The moment
you let your guard down,

08:16.776 --> 08:19.411
they just walk all over you.

08:19.445 --> 08:21.680
Tonight is the night to beat them
at their own game.

08:23.716 --> 08:25.350
Hey, Artie!

08:25.385 --> 08:27.686
Bet you can't lift me!

08:29.922 --> 08:32.157
Uh, all sales
of Bunny Money are final.

08:32.191 --> 08:35.427
How am I supposed
to spend $2,000 on dancers?

08:35.461 --> 08:37.095
Oh, no.
Our dancers don't take it.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.873
- What?
- However, uh,

08:38.878 --> 08:40.381
Bunny Money is redeemable
at the bar,

08:40.417 --> 08:43.335
our gift shop and our sister club
in Fort Myers, Florida.

08:43.369 --> 08:44.703
What?!

08:44.737 --> 08:46.071
Body shot.

08:49.375 --> 08:50.742
You taste delicious,
do you know that?

08:50.777 --> 08:52.010
What is that? An aftertaste?

08:52.045 --> 08:53.612
- Probably baby formula.
- Oh...

08:53.646 --> 08:54.613
Tuesday nights!

08:54.647 --> 08:56.615
Girl, you are a pistol.

08:56.649 --> 08:58.350
I'll tell you what,

08:58.384 --> 09:00.685
how 'bout you and me go back

09:00.720 --> 09:03.221
and I dance on you this time?

09:04.957 --> 09:07.459
Oh, man.

09:07.493 --> 09:08.794
Tuesdays nights.

09:08.828 --> 09:10.629
You know, for a chub,
you're a terrible heavy.

09:10.663 --> 09:13.565
Let's just get Coach really drunk
until he passes out.

09:13.599 --> 09:15.874
Then we take him home.
Shot contest.

09:15.909 --> 09:17.869
Like in Raiders of the Lost Ark,
Schmidt.

09:17.904 --> 09:19.476
I'm not ripping a page
from that pro-Nazi film.

09:19.510 --> 09:20.777
It isn't pro-Nazi.

09:20.812 --> 09:22.941
Of course it is. It might as
well be an SS propaganda movie.

09:22.975 --> 09:25.343
No, everybody in a Nazi uniform
literally dies.

09:25.378 --> 09:27.709
Yeah, the...
When she puts the hand

09:27.744 --> 09:29.047
- into the, uh...
- The heart.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.850
No, not...
Well, that happens, too. Nazis.

09:31.884 --> 09:33.652
I don't think that makes you a Nazi.

09:33.686 --> 09:35.454
They ate the monkey brains,
and there was all the bugs.

09:35.488 --> 09:37.122
Nazi, Nazi.

09:37.156 --> 09:38.490
Nick's at a strip club,

09:38.524 --> 09:40.792
but he's just being a normal guy
in his 20s that wants

09:40.827 --> 09:42.961
to hang out with other guys
in their 20s.

09:42.995 --> 09:44.663
They're all in their 30s.

09:44.697 --> 09:46.131
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

09:46.165 --> 09:47.466
Enough about Nick.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.834
What do you do

09:48.868 --> 09:50.669
when you're not making coffee
at the coffee shop?

09:50.703 --> 09:53.338
- Well, actually, I own the coffee shop.
- What?

09:53.372 --> 09:54.840
It's not as glamorous
as you may think.

09:54.874 --> 09:56.274
It's a lot of spreadsheets

09:56.309 --> 09:58.777
and jetting off to Brazil
at a moment's notice.

09:58.811 --> 10:00.779
Nick's never been to Brazil.

10:00.813 --> 10:02.214
Maybe you should step away.

10:02.248 --> 10:05.784
You know, call Nick up
and hash things out.

10:05.818 --> 10:07.085
Hmm-mm, can't call Nick
'cause then he'll know

10:07.120 --> 10:08.086
I'm thinking about him.

10:08.121 --> 10:09.788
- Ah.
- And then he wins.

10:09.822 --> 10:11.423
Maybe you both win.

10:11.457 --> 10:12.591
Say Brazil again.

10:12.625 --> 10:13.925
Brazil.

10:16.062 --> 10:18.263
Say "rubber baby buggy bumpers."

10:18.297 --> 10:20.065
Rubber babby buggy bumpers.

10:20.099 --> 10:21.633
Oh, my God!

10:21.667 --> 10:23.768
Shot contest isn't working.

10:23.803 --> 10:25.270
It's only making him stronger.

10:25.304 --> 10:27.939
It's Jess.

10:27.974 --> 10:30.709
Hey, Jess,
I'm so glad you called!

10:30.743 --> 10:32.611
Nick, can I talk to you
for a second?

10:32.645 --> 10:35.380
Oh, is that, uh,
Notorious N.A.G.?

10:35.414 --> 10:37.315
- Hey!
- Is that Naggie Gyllenhaal?

10:37.350 --> 10:41.453
Hey, I don't need your help
checking my woman.

10:41.487 --> 10:43.188
You're checking your woman?

10:43.222 --> 10:44.723
Wait, how did you hear that?

10:44.757 --> 10:47.192
You were covering
the listening part, dummy.

10:47.226 --> 10:48.360
Yeah, but they look the same.

10:48.394 --> 10:49.728
I'm too drunk.

10:49.762 --> 10:51.997
Well, I'm way drunk, too,
and I'm with a man.

10:52.031 --> 10:53.732
What?

10:53.766 --> 10:56.334
He owns a business,
and he goes to Brazil.

10:57.331 --> 10:59.155
- Nick?
- Oh, it's a coin flip.

10:59.205 --> 11:00.305
Hello?

11:00.339 --> 11:02.040
He's so immature.

11:02.074 --> 11:04.075
Jess!

11:04.110 --> 11:05.477
Jess, I got it.

11:05.511 --> 11:06.878
Hey, I think you guys
have had enough.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.480
Why don't you let me
give you a ride home?

11:08.514 --> 11:09.748
Wait, you weren't drinking?

11:09.782 --> 11:11.149
Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink.

11:11.184 --> 11:12.884
I got to get a jump on the morning.

11:12.919 --> 11:14.691
Well, you really have it together.

11:14.726 --> 11:16.955
I bet you can use a phone, too.

11:16.989 --> 11:19.457
Your bar for having it together
is set pretty low.

11:19.492 --> 11:21.660
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

11:21.694 --> 11:24.663
- We can just grab a cab home.
- Cece, this was your idea.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.765
Artie, can we take your jet?

11:26.799 --> 11:29.367
Oh, it's just one coffee shop.

11:29.402 --> 11:31.269
Wouldn't you like to know?

11:31.804 --> 11:34.539
All right, guys,
give it up for Candy!

11:34.574 --> 11:35.874
Is that lobster gray?

11:35.908 --> 11:36.942
Most expensive thing on the menu.

11:36.976 --> 11:38.877
I got to go.

11:38.911 --> 11:39.878
What?

11:39.912 --> 11:41.613
Jess is drinking
and talking to some guy.

11:41.647 --> 11:44.382
Forget her, dude.
Relationships are prisons.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.585
How often do we get
to hang out like this?

11:46.619 --> 11:47.886
I haven't seen you in two years.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.888
Strippers and booze forever.

11:49.922 --> 11:50.989
- Hear, hear.
- There it is.

11:51.023 --> 11:52.190
No, stop, no, no.

11:52.225 --> 11:55.227
Relationships are not prisons,

11:55.261 --> 11:56.561
and Jess is amazing.

11:56.596 --> 11:59.097
She's sexy

11:59.131 --> 12:00.599
and sweet,

12:00.633 --> 12:02.934
and I can't lose her.

12:02.969 --> 12:05.470
So I'm going home to see her.

12:10.476 --> 12:13.111
Why are you crying?
We can see each other tomorrow.

12:13.145 --> 12:15.680
I didn't break up with Malia,
all right?

12:16.315 --> 12:19.551
- She broke up with me.
- Why didn't you say anything, man?

12:19.585 --> 12:21.553
'Cause I was embarrassed,
Winston.

12:22.688 --> 12:23.822
I lost her.

12:23.856 --> 12:26.491
I was just trying to fill a void
with all these naked chicks.

12:26.525 --> 12:29.561
I don't want to be here.
I want to be in love.

12:29.595 --> 12:32.230
Oh, Coach, this is so pathetic.

12:32.265 --> 12:35.857
Now she's dating
some dude named Derrique.

12:35.892 --> 12:37.669
Or Derek.

12:37.703 --> 12:40.105
Coach, you need to go home,
and I need to go home, too.

12:40.139 --> 12:41.439
You're right, man.

12:41.474 --> 12:43.575
You have to fight
for your relationships.

12:43.609 --> 12:45.243
- Freaking Derrique.
- Let's go.

12:45.278 --> 12:47.245
Mm-mmm, guys, guys,
you cannot leave.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.314
Dude, I was just crying.
I want to get out of here.

12:49.348 --> 12:50.982
It's embarrassing.
He cried in a strip club.

12:51.017 --> 12:52.751
All the dudes saw me cry.
Dude, I want to leave.

12:52.785 --> 12:55.453
Man, I got Bunny Money
coming out of my pockets.

12:56.488 --> 12:58.857
Wait a minute,
this ain't the way home.

12:58.891 --> 13:00.992
Yeah, we're just gonna make
a quick stop.

13:01.027 --> 13:04.429
We're gonna kick
Malia's boyfriend's ass.

13:04.463 --> 13:06.598
Wait, this is a police station?

13:06.632 --> 13:07.599
Uh-huh, that's where he works.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.768
You want to drunk fight a cop?

13:09.802 --> 13:12.404
He stole my girlfriend.

13:12.438 --> 13:13.938
Did you hear the joke
about the two black guys

13:13.973 --> 13:15.940
and two white guys who walked
into a police station?

13:15.975 --> 13:19.010
- The two white guys came out.
- I'm with Winston.

13:19.045 --> 13:20.011
- Winston?
- Mm-hmm?

13:20.046 --> 13:23.148
I got two of these,
and you got one more of those.

13:23.182 --> 13:24.683
- Put that away.
- Coach!

13:24.717 --> 13:25.784
Coach, let's do it.

13:25.818 --> 13:26.951
- Coach, no!
- Let's get raucous.

13:26.986 --> 13:28.453
- I'm ready.
- We're not ready!

13:29.050 --> 13:31.751
- He is pure life force.
- He's a lunatic, man.

13:31.785 --> 13:32.752
I got to get out of here.

13:32.786 --> 13:34.153
I want to go, too.
I got a work thing.

13:34.187 --> 13:36.422
- Well, I got a girl thing, dude.
- Work trumps girls.

13:36.456 --> 13:37.857
Girls are replaceable.
Jobs are forever.

13:37.891 --> 13:40.192
I bet I get left with the fare.
I just bet...

13:40.227 --> 13:41.727
Hey, driver,
let me just ask you something.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.396
Do you like strippers?

13:43.430 --> 13:46.332
Do you also like the deal
of a lifetime?

13:46.366 --> 13:47.700
I wanted to leave first.

13:47.734 --> 13:49.235
I've been saying that
the whole night,

13:49.269 --> 13:50.870
and none of you guys
can stop me.

13:50.904 --> 13:53.205
You think that you can...
you can...

13:53.240 --> 13:56.509
beat me in a physical altercation
of fisticuffs?

13:56.543 --> 13:58.344
I will beat you in a way

13:58.378 --> 14:01.180
that you've never been beaten before.

14:02.582 --> 14:03.949
Ooh.

14:03.984 --> 14:04.984
Damn it!

14:05.018 --> 14:06.218
You got hit in the face, son.

14:06.253 --> 14:07.953
Hit me again.

14:07.988 --> 14:09.622
'Cause I swear

14:09.656 --> 14:11.057
you'll be... I'll be...

14:11.091 --> 14:15.361
Loosen up your neck so I can put you
into the headlock of a lifetime.

14:15.395 --> 14:16.996
Guys, it's escalating, look!

14:17.030 --> 14:19.198
I'm a cop, pew, pew, pew.

14:19.232 --> 14:21.400
No, no, no, no, no.

14:21.435 --> 14:23.302
Thanks for the ride, Artie.

14:23.336 --> 14:24.904
Bathroom's down the hall.

14:24.938 --> 14:26.138
It's the one with the urinals.

14:26.173 --> 14:27.540
I do live with men.

14:27.574 --> 14:29.575
Nay, boys.

14:32.412 --> 14:34.547
Look, if he can pee in Brazil,

14:34.581 --> 14:35.981
he can pee at my house.

14:36.016 --> 14:37.349
- Do you actually like this guy?
- What?

14:37.384 --> 14:39.518
No, no.

14:39.553 --> 14:42.154
Nick couldn't call me his girlfriend,

14:42.189 --> 14:43.789
and that hurt.

14:43.824 --> 14:47.193
Now I want to hurt him back
with some long,

14:47.227 --> 14:50.329
hot conversation.

14:50.363 --> 14:51.897
- That's what you really want to do?
- Yes.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.432
Men suck, remember?

14:53.467 --> 14:54.867
I'm sorry about saying that,

14:54.901 --> 14:56.836
because I put that on you,
all right?

14:56.870 --> 15:00.206
That's because I'm going through
something right now with Schmidt.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.908
- You have Nick.
- Nick's a child

15:02.943 --> 15:04.877
who drinks on Tuesdays.

15:04.911 --> 15:07.012
You're drinking on a Tuesday
and you are a teacher.

15:07.047 --> 15:09.014
Those kids are watching
a movie tomorrow.

15:09.049 --> 15:11.250
Look, Nick doesn't have a life plan.

15:11.284 --> 15:12.952
He doesn't have a day plan.

15:12.986 --> 15:15.087
I once found a note
he wrote to himself

15:15.122 --> 15:16.856
that said "Put on pants"

15:16.890 --> 15:19.191
followed by a question mark.

15:19.226 --> 15:21.894
That means it read,
"Put on pants?"

15:21.928 --> 15:25.064
Also, he throws pizza at seagulls,

15:25.098 --> 15:29.268
which I guess is kind of nice
because he's trying to feed them.

15:30.303 --> 15:33.172
And he's a really,

15:33.206 --> 15:35.107
really great kisser.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.643
You have something really good.

15:39.780 --> 15:43.716
Just go get Artie and tell him
to leave, all right?

15:43.750 --> 15:44.950
Can you just get Derek?!

15:44.985 --> 15:46.152
Hey! Hey!

15:46.186 --> 15:47.253
He's gonna get the whole precinct!

15:47.287 --> 15:48.888
This is a high-income area.

15:48.922 --> 15:50.788
They're very bored in there.

15:50.891 --> 15:54.260
Oh, my goodness,
this jacket smells like gasoline.

15:54.294 --> 15:56.295
Guys, come on.

15:56.329 --> 15:58.464
Come on, man,
we're too old for this.

15:58.498 --> 16:01.801
- We're too old for this whole night.
- What?

16:01.835 --> 16:04.069
Life changes.
You got to grow up.

16:04.104 --> 16:07.072
I did. I'm in a relationship,
and I'm happy.

16:07.107 --> 16:09.775
Schmidt moved out of the loft,
and he's happy.

16:09.810 --> 16:11.076
I'm miserable!

16:11.111 --> 16:13.012
- It's your fault.
- What are you talking about?

16:13.046 --> 16:14.513
I'm in a vacancy room!

16:14.548 --> 16:17.483
- A room of vacancy! Empty nest!
- By choice! By choice!

16:17.517 --> 16:19.185
Let me tell you something,
when I'm done with you,

16:19.219 --> 16:20.486
your face is gonna look
all melted

16:20.520 --> 16:22.087
like the president
at the end of Raiders.

16:22.122 --> 16:23.522
He wasn't a president!
You saw a different movie

16:23.557 --> 16:25.958
- than everybody else in the world!
- I'll kill you!

16:25.992 --> 16:27.459
- He wasn't a president.
- Guys, guys!

16:27.494 --> 16:28.894
Kick you in the butt!

16:28.929 --> 16:30.362
- Don't! You touched my penis!
- Hey, hey!

16:30.397 --> 16:31.697
Don't touch my penis!

16:31.731 --> 16:32.832
Stop! Stop it!

16:32.866 --> 16:34.300
- You just touched my penis!
- Hey! Hey!

16:34.334 --> 16:36.202
You touched my...

16:37.537 --> 16:38.737
You guys, grow up!

16:38.772 --> 16:42.675
- You grow up. Grow up!
- Coach? What are you doing here?

16:44.511 --> 16:48.781
- Is this about Malia?
- Yeah, it's about Malia.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.903
Take care of her, man.

16:56.489 --> 16:58.123
Yeah, I will.

16:58.158 --> 17:00.359
I'm a cop,

17:00.393 --> 17:02.027
not some drunk loser.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.164
Get out of here.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.036
Should we grow up
tomorrow night?

17:12.739 --> 17:14.240
Yeah.

17:14.273 --> 17:15.507
Muscle time!

17:15.541 --> 17:16.608
- Get on the ground!
- Muscle time!

17:16.643 --> 17:18.676
- I'm a cop!
- Back up!

17:18.712 --> 17:20.479
- I got a badge and a gun!
- Arrest me, dude!

17:21.848 --> 17:23.682
He's got backup! Go! Go!

17:23.717 --> 17:25.217
- Go! Go!
- Go!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.152
Serpentine!

17:27.186 --> 17:29.121
Serpentine!

17:35.228 --> 17:37.229
Artie, I have to hit the hay.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.001
Oh, dear!

17:42.035 --> 17:43.168
Don't worry.

17:43.203 --> 17:45.204
I'm gonna make you coffee
in the morning.

17:51.087 --> 17:54.329
It's been a really great evening,
what a treat it's been,

17:54.390 --> 17:56.657
but I think somewhere
along the way,

17:56.692 --> 17:57.825
some signals got crossed.

17:57.860 --> 18:00.294
Signals could not have been
any clearer.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.963
Come on in.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.998
The water's warm.

18:05.601 --> 18:07.235
Are you splashing me?

18:07.269 --> 18:08.636
I'm fixing to mix you up.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.137
Seriously?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.973
Oh, men are such dicks.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.113
All right, guys, second wind.

18:19.147 --> 18:21.682
You got an old TV?
Let's throw it off the roof.

18:21.717 --> 18:24.151
Come on,
you're crashing with me.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.188
And you,
go talk to your girlfriend.

18:27.222 --> 18:28.656
Thanks.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.925
Hey, it was a fun night.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.693
All right, guys.

18:32.728 --> 18:33.794
Let's go, Shrimp Forks.

18:33.829 --> 18:36.097
Coach, Shrimp Forks?

18:36.131 --> 18:37.632
Come on, man,
that makes no sense.

18:37.666 --> 18:39.333
I played professional basketball.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.835
You got to stop calling me that.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.336
I'm sorry, man.

18:43.071 --> 18:44.672
Hop along, Bunny Money.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.407
Better than Shrimp Forks.

18:46.441 --> 18:47.942
- I'll take that.
- Fantastic.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.911
It only cost you $2,000.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.345
It did, didn't it?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.916
The Brazilians have the same word
for making love to one woman

18:54.950 --> 18:57.385
as they do
for making love to two.

18:58.627 --> 19:01.449
Mah-gaa-leesh.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.958
Take off your tops
and say it with me.

19:03.992 --> 19:04.825
Jess!

19:04.860 --> 19:06.527
Oh, my God, that's Nick!

19:06.561 --> 19:08.930
Okay, okay,
you-you just get him dressed.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.131
I will stall Nick.

19:10.165 --> 19:11.632
I am really good
at this kind of thing.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.301
Oh, my God.

19:13.335 --> 19:14.669
Nick, hey, great.

19:14.703 --> 19:16.437
I've been wanting to talk to you
about this side table.

19:16.471 --> 19:17.872
What kind of wood is it
made out of?

19:17.906 --> 19:18.873
Jess, I failed!

19:18.907 --> 19:20.074
Jess.

19:21.276 --> 19:23.477
Welcome, brother.

19:23.512 --> 19:25.313
Oh, my God.

19:25.347 --> 19:27.248
Nick, I can't imagine what
you must be thinking right now.

19:27.282 --> 19:28.849
Actually, I can.

19:28.884 --> 19:30.017
This is your worst nightmare.

19:30.052 --> 19:31.585
There's a very good-looking man
in my bed,

19:31.620 --> 19:32.653
and he's naked,

19:32.688 --> 19:34.922
and I'm flushed,
and I'm flustered.

19:34.957 --> 19:37.391
I might as well just spray paint
"Jay Cutler sucks" on the wall

19:37.426 --> 19:39.226
and just round
out the whole image, right?

19:39.261 --> 19:42.129
But, Nick, nothing happened,

19:42.164 --> 19:44.598
and nothing was ever going
to happen,

19:44.633 --> 19:47.668
and you have to believe me,
please.

19:47.703 --> 19:51.605
Say you believe me, please.

19:54.609 --> 19:57.044
I believe you.

20:01.249 --> 20:04.018
Do you have any questions?

20:04.052 --> 20:06.020
Do you want me
to have questions?

20:06.054 --> 20:07.922
Well...

20:07.956 --> 20:09.256
Hey, Artie?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.659
I'm gonna need you

20:11.693 --> 20:13.861
to get out
of my girlfriend's bed, man.

20:15.397 --> 20:16.864
Well, uh,

20:16.898 --> 20:19.500
I'm naked and-and in bed,

20:19.534 --> 20:21.969
and you're fully clothed
and standing,

20:22.004 --> 20:24.472
so I mean, I hardly think
this would be a fair fight.

20:24.506 --> 20:26.907
Well, I'd like it to be a fair fight.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.744
Thank God for snaps.

20:29.778 --> 20:31.379
Men are so weird.

20:31.413 --> 20:33.214
I must warn you,

20:33.248 --> 20:36.384
while spending time in Brazil...

20:36.418 --> 20:39.320
Let get situated first
before we get into this thing.

20:39.354 --> 20:41.122
Oh, my God!

20:42.057 --> 20:43.691
- Bye-bye.
- Don't die, big guy.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.927
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:46.962 --> 20:48.796
You called me your girlfriend.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.431
Did I? I don't remember.

20:54.703 --> 20:56.003
Where's Winston with the food?

20:56.038 --> 20:58.105
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:58.140 --> 21:01.008
It was crazy at the V-Rab.
Bachelor party season.

21:01.043 --> 21:03.077
- I got a deep-dish gyrator, no mushrooms.
- That's me.

21:03.111 --> 21:04.345
Don't call it V-Rab.

21:04.379 --> 21:06.313
Please.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.416
I got the main stage fish tacos.

21:08.450 --> 21:10.317
- No regrets.
- Great order.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.719
Pour some sugar on meatballs?

21:11.753 --> 21:13.154
- Oh, that's me.
- Thank you.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.830
Let's see, and I got the short
stack ass-clap pancakes.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.275
You want to switch?

21:19.514 --> 21:21.874
- Schmidt, you want a taco?
- No, I'm gonna take one of Winston's.

21:21.908 --> 21:23.542
- Take it if you want it, dude.
- I was just thinking

21:23.577 --> 21:26.445
maybe-maybe you guys
could chip in a little bit.

21:26.479 --> 21:29.180
- 'Cause it was expensive.
- You want one of Winston's tacos?

21:29.461 --> 21:32.104
I'll take 50 cents on the dollar,
I really would. I really would.

21:33.405 --> 21:34.990
Please?
