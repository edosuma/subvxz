WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:04.878
Alexandra Parrish, my
name is Matthew Keyes.

00:04.913 --> 00:07.613
We hear you're looking for a job.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.429
Can I think about it?

00:11.430 --> 00:14.020
This offer expires the second
you step out of the car.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.259
It is my belief,

00:15.260 --> 00:17.791
as it is many others who work for me,

00:17.826 --> 00:21.027
that the FBI treated you terribly,

00:21.063 --> 00:23.729
and then they hung you out to dry.

00:23.764 --> 00:27.466
So, are you ready for what comes next?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.130
Yes.

00:30.132 --> 00:34.423
_

00:34.500 --> 00:37.035
_

00:37.245 --> 00:38.877
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.267
Raina. What's up?

00:40.269 --> 00:41.580
Making sure you're okay.

00:41.615 --> 00:43.015
I'll be better when it's over.

00:43.050 --> 00:44.598
I'll have time

00:44.599 --> 00:46.196
once they're done
with the first meeting.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.352
I'm one building away.

00:47.387 --> 00:49.822
I've left a pass in your name.

00:55.529 --> 00:56.667
Are you still there?

00:56.668 --> 00:58.749
I thought I saw
something, but I'm sure it's fine.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.077
I'll see you in an hour.
It shouldn't take that long.

01:01.101 --> 01:03.101
Okay. Bye.

01:03.136 --> 01:05.870
Monday through Friday,
the Financial District bustles

01:05.905 --> 01:08.873
with businessmen and women
moving at a breakneck pace.

01:08.908 --> 01:11.109
On this Saturday,
the buildings are empty,

01:11.144 --> 01:13.544
but the streets are
full of world leaders

01:13.579 --> 01:15.747
who are gathering under high security

01:15.782 --> 01:16.848
to ask the question

01:16.883 --> 01:19.316
"Should we put an end
to global surveillance?"

01:19.352 --> 01:20.785
President Todd...

01:20.820 --> 01:23.054
Here with his wife,
First Lady Elaine Todd...

01:23.089 --> 01:25.890
Is ready to deliver the keynote address.

01:25.925 --> 01:28.059
Parrish? You're...

01:28.094 --> 01:30.594
I was. A long time ago.

01:30.630 --> 01:32.730
You working the summit for the FBI?

01:32.765 --> 01:34.298
No. Just a civilian.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.634
Well, welcome inside the perimeter.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.753
_

01:38.871 --> 01:40.137
Excuse me.

01:43.008 --> 01:43.940
Hey.

01:43.976 --> 01:45.142
Hey.

01:45.177 --> 01:46.442
Thanks for coming.

01:46.478 --> 01:48.511
It's my only day in the city.

01:48.546 --> 01:50.013
Yeah, I heard.

01:50.048 --> 01:52.149
You made it onto the president's
daily briefing team.

01:52.184 --> 01:53.250
As of last week.

01:53.285 --> 01:53.984
Congratulations.

01:54.019 --> 01:55.385
Thank you.

01:57.156 --> 02:00.090
My team's waiting for
me in Federal Hall, so...

02:00.125 --> 02:02.191
- How is she, Ryan?
- Alex.

02:02.226 --> 02:02.825
You're right.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.360
I-I shouldn't. I'm sorry.

02:04.396 --> 02:06.095
- It isn't...
- It's not?

02:08.032 --> 02:10.633
Did you bring it?

02:10.669 --> 02:12.702
You know, sometimes
I wish we'd said no...

02:12.737 --> 02:14.270
To the mission, to all of this.

02:14.306 --> 02:16.138
There was no mission, Alex.

02:16.174 --> 02:17.307
We were chasing ghosts.

02:17.342 --> 02:20.142
They weren't ghosts, Ryan.
They were just smarter than us.

02:20.178 --> 02:21.221
You gonna give it to me or not?

02:24.048 --> 02:25.347
Looks like she needs you.

02:27.218 --> 02:28.784
The briefing takes 15 minutes.

02:28.820 --> 02:30.252
You'll be here when I get back?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

Please clear the checkpoint area.

02:52.075 --> 02:54.275
Please clear the checkpoint area.

03:09.692 --> 03:11.392
- Hi.
- I know we're not supposed to speak,

03:11.427 --> 03:12.760
but I need a favor from you.

03:12.795 --> 03:13.927
Of course you do.

03:13.963 --> 03:15.103
I need you to use the database

03:15.105 --> 03:16.107
to run someone's photo for me.

03:16.131 --> 03:17.448
Alex, I can't just...

03:17.449 --> 03:19.445
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't
important, Shelby. Please.

03:19.469 --> 03:21.201
Important how?

03:21.237 --> 03:23.203
I just saw a dead man.

03:23.239 --> 03:26.240
Okay, what man, and what makes
you think that he's dead?

03:26.275 --> 03:28.541
'Cause I'm the one who killed him.

03:33.559 --> 03:36.777
_

03:39.018 --> 03:41.131
Director Keyes, I was going
through this Intel report,

03:41.155 --> 03:43.089
and I thought...

03:43.124 --> 03:46.259
Not what you were expecting
when the CIA recruited you, huh?

03:46.294 --> 03:49.228
Probably thought
James Bond, not Mike Judge.

03:49.264 --> 03:52.532
I was in the basement my last job.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.133
How long have you been down here?

03:55.303 --> 03:56.903
Five... years?

04:00.790 --> 04:02.278
_

04:08.016 --> 04:09.782
To whom should I make this... out?

04:27.415 --> 04:29.152
_

04:42.115 --> 04:44.285
_

04:46.953 --> 04:47.919
Welcome home.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.129
Thank you.

04:58.717 --> 05:00.310
_

05:24.692 --> 05:26.426
_

05:41.572 --> 05:43.793
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

05:43.794 --> 05:45.186
Just me complaining,

05:45.210 --> 05:46.354
and you get enough of that at home.

05:46.378 --> 05:48.644
She had to do the agent update today.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.513
- It's fine, really.
- It's not fine.

05:50.548 --> 05:51.547
It's not fine.

05:51.582 --> 05:54.216
You finally speak Shelby!
I'm so proud of you!

05:54.251 --> 05:56.519
Well, I am happy at headquarters. I am.

05:56.554 --> 05:59.254
It's a big deal, and I
lobbied Miranda for it.

05:59.289 --> 06:01.056
But, being asked to write up

06:01.091 --> 06:04.092
what our former classmates
are doing... it's mean.

06:04.128 --> 06:05.594
Okay, I have to ask.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.897
Nimah busted a cartel in Arizona.

06:07.932 --> 06:11.099
Iris got a conviction on
that trafficker in Miami.

06:11.135 --> 06:14.436
Brandon got promoted
to behavioral analysis.

06:14.471 --> 06:16.604
My job? The company Christmas letter.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.873
Even Caleb is having more fun than me.

06:18.909 --> 06:20.442
Berkeley Law? I doubt it.

06:20.477 --> 06:22.044
Maybe if he'd gone to Boulder.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.413
And then Alex,

06:24.448 --> 06:27.348
who was the most famous
FBI agent in decades,

06:27.383 --> 06:29.884
is also stuck behind a
desk at a security firm.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.141
What is wrong with these people?

06:31.142 --> 06:32.921
From "Call of Duty" to carpal tunnel.

06:32.956 --> 06:33.621
What about you?

06:33.657 --> 06:34.433
No, hold on. Let me guess.

06:34.457 --> 06:37.959
You are going undercover at NASCAR.

06:37.994 --> 06:38.826
Or the White House.

06:38.862 --> 06:40.929
Or no... maybe on tour with Beyoncé.

06:40.964 --> 06:41.796
Yes!

06:41.831 --> 06:43.264
I couldn't tell you if I wanted to.

06:43.299 --> 06:44.965
All I know is that it starts tomorrow.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.567
I don't get back until this weekend.

06:46.602 --> 06:48.702
Well, Netflix and I
will take good care of her.

06:48.737 --> 06:50.304
We'll make it work.

06:50.339 --> 06:52.406
I don't want to wait for
a drink. Anyone want one?

06:52.442 --> 06:53.652
- Drown me.
- I'm driving, so...

06:53.676 --> 06:54.942
Okay.

06:57.447 --> 06:59.345
Okay. Where is it?

07:03.285 --> 07:05.919
You were right to go
with the rose-gold band

07:05.955 --> 07:07.120
and the vintage cut.

07:07.155 --> 07:08.789
I just did what you told me to do.

07:08.824 --> 07:10.490
Which is why you have my blessing.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.760
Are you gonna do it tonight?

07:14.830 --> 07:16.096
Shut up! Quiet!

07:16.131 --> 07:17.430
Thank you.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.266
Be right back.

07:27.109 --> 07:29.309
Alexandra Parrish, you
have been chosen to test

07:29.344 --> 07:31.777
for training in the
National Clandestine Service.

07:31.813 --> 07:33.813
You need to leave the bar right now.

07:33.848 --> 07:35.915
You will receive directions shortly.

07:38.486 --> 07:40.486
So, of course,
there's an emergency at work.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.788
One of our clients
might be getting hacked.

07:42.824 --> 07:44.323
They're calling everyone in.

07:44.358 --> 07:46.092
Well, do you have to leave this second?

07:46.127 --> 07:47.426
Yeah.

07:47.461 --> 07:49.194
Hey, I don't know how late I'll be.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.762
Um, I might miss you.

07:50.797 --> 07:54.333
Well, it'll just make
the weekend that much better.

07:54.368 --> 07:55.501
Go save a company.

07:55.536 --> 07:57.436
And you save the world.

07:57.471 --> 07:58.337
Bye.

07:58.372 --> 07:59.404
Mwah.

08:11.051 --> 08:13.652
In 100 feet, stay to the left.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.555
Drive through the gate.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.824
The security guard
will wave you through.

08:32.938 --> 08:34.505
Welcome to The Farm.

08:34.541 --> 08:37.475
This is the CIA's one
and only training facility.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.876
If you're here, that means
you're very good,

08:39.912 --> 08:41.788
but that doesn't mean you'll stay.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.525
Over the next 24 hours,

08:43.549 --> 08:45.382
you'll undergo a battery of tests

08:45.417 --> 08:50.087
to determine who will go
from Agency asset to operative.

08:50.122 --> 08:51.321
Follow us.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.400
Are you kidding me?

09:03.435 --> 09:04.879
This is your undercover assignment...

09:04.903 --> 09:05.902
To spy on me again?

09:05.937 --> 09:07.370
What are you even doing here?

09:07.406 --> 09:08.115
I can't tell you that.

09:08.139 --> 09:09.439
Well, I can't tell you, either.

09:09.474 --> 09:10.785
You said you were going undercover.

09:10.809 --> 09:13.042
I am. I'm...

09:13.078 --> 09:14.844
I'm here for the FBI.

09:14.879 --> 09:16.478
So am I.

09:27.628 --> 09:29.290
_

09:29.327 --> 09:31.427
Summit starting in one minute.

09:31.462 --> 09:34.263
Please clear the checkpoint area.

09:34.298 --> 09:36.465
I ran your photo. It
is not Jeremy Miller.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.634
It belongs to someone named Paulo Silva,

09:38.669 --> 09:41.537
who is very much alive and works
for Embratel in Rio de Janeiro.

09:41.572 --> 09:42.404
Are you sure?

09:42.440 --> 09:44.740
Customs shows he landed at JFK yester...

09:47.978 --> 09:48.610
Hello?

09:48.645 --> 09:50.478
Can you get a signal?

09:50.513 --> 09:51.579
I got nothing.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.293
Everybody, get down now!

10:14.504 --> 10:18.779

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

10:19.628 --> 10:21.258
Thank you very much.

10:26.079 --> 10:27.412
Let's move! Let's move!

10:27.811 --> 10:29.549
- What's happening?
- We need to get the

10:29.574 --> 10:31.545
president and the
first lady out of here.

10:59.311 --> 11:00.820
I've been working this for eight months!

11:00.844 --> 11:01.589
You fired her publicly!

11:01.613 --> 11:03.658
- And you... you lied to me,
- You knew we were in a relationship!

11:03.682 --> 11:04.906
Pretending to work at
some... some security

11:04.930 --> 11:05.961
- company,
- You knew I was lying to him!

11:05.985 --> 11:07.408
Yet you couldn't be
bothered knowing this would happen

11:07.409 --> 11:09.143
to tell me when I get
here he's gonna be here, too!

11:09.144 --> 11:11.154
Enough! You don't have time for this.

11:11.190 --> 11:12.601
You have to be back before dawn.

11:12.602 --> 11:13.820
You could've just told us

11:13.821 --> 11:15.407
we were both getting
this assignment, Miranda.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.372
- I had to keep you in the dark.
- Under whose orders?

11:17.396 --> 11:18.528
Mine.

11:18.563 --> 11:20.029
Alex, Miranda had to let you go

11:20.064 --> 11:22.298
so that no one would suspect
you were still FBI

11:22.333 --> 11:23.533
if you got into The Farm.

11:23.568 --> 11:25.635
And what about Ryan? Was he fired, too?

11:25.670 --> 11:28.271
No, Ryan's face wasn't all over
magazines and TV screens.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.806
Look, while I can recruit analysts,

11:30.841 --> 11:32.375
I don't control The Farm.

11:32.410 --> 11:34.703
I put you at Langley in hopes
that you'd get invited,

11:34.705 --> 11:37.846
but it was taking too long,
so I put Ryan on their radar,

11:37.882 --> 11:39.882
hoping he'd get tapped, and he did.

11:39.918 --> 11:41.687
The fact that it was at the same time,

11:41.689 --> 11:43.010
that's just coincidence.

11:43.011 --> 11:44.164
- There's no such thing.
- There's no such thing.

11:44.188 --> 11:45.894
That's what the FBI teaches you,

11:45.895 --> 11:47.422
but at the Agency, we rely on them.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.657
Right place, right
time... That can save your life.

11:49.693 --> 11:53.262
And now, with both of you here,
that just doubles our odds.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.443
Look, the FBI and the CIA

11:56.445 --> 11:57.971
used to be able to
do whatever they wanted

11:57.995 --> 11:59.995
in the name of national security,

12:00.031 --> 12:00.863
but over the years,

12:00.898 --> 12:03.365
laws have been passed... Rightfully...

12:03.400 --> 12:05.667
To keep us from crossing the line.

12:05.703 --> 12:07.770
We believe that
some people in the Agency

12:07.805 --> 12:09.671
decided they're done with these laws.

12:09.707 --> 12:11.473
They want the old ways restored...

12:11.508 --> 12:14.810
No accountability,
no rules, no oversight.

12:14.846 --> 12:16.846
Now, whoever this rogue group is,

12:16.881 --> 12:19.381
they've been growing
within the CIA for years

12:19.416 --> 12:22.718
with their own nefarious agenda,
and we need to stop them.

12:22.753 --> 12:24.953
The recruitment is happening
on The Farm,

12:24.988 --> 12:28.022
and we believe Owen Hall,
who is the head instructor,

12:28.058 --> 12:29.725
is finding the right candidates

12:29.760 --> 12:31.793
and indoctrinating them
while training them

12:31.828 --> 12:33.462
right alongside the other students.

12:33.497 --> 12:36.231
So we need you to get close
to your fellow recruits,

12:36.266 --> 12:37.966
figure out who may be chosen,

12:38.001 --> 12:41.035
and, if you can, get chosen yourself.

12:41.071 --> 12:44.172
The only way for us to know
who's in charge is if you get inside.

12:44.207 --> 12:45.974
Well, won't sending in
two former FBI agents

12:46.009 --> 12:47.575
who are in a romantic relationship

12:47.610 --> 12:49.677
raise some red flags as to
the reasons we're there?

12:49.712 --> 12:50.857
Well, they don't know
you've been romantic.

12:50.881 --> 12:53.314
You just have to maintain
a professional relationship

12:53.349 --> 12:55.527
in the eyes of your fellow
recruits and your instructors.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.652
And if you had a
prior working connection,

12:57.687 --> 12:58.686
that's a good thing.

12:58.721 --> 13:00.254
It's that type of coincidence

13:00.290 --> 13:02.723
that can actually
throw people off a scent.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.392
Look, I know it's the Bureau's job

13:04.427 --> 13:06.193
to police the intelligence community,

13:06.228 --> 13:08.929
but undercover in the CIA,

13:08.964 --> 13:11.098
surrounded by a bunch
of future anarchists?

13:11.133 --> 13:12.065
That's, uh... That's...

13:12.101 --> 13:14.101
That's insane!

13:14.136 --> 13:14.902
I know.

13:14.937 --> 13:17.204
I know... Calling this a challenge

13:17.239 --> 13:19.406
is the understatement of the century,

13:19.441 --> 13:23.610
but everyone in this room
has experienced firsthand

13:23.645 --> 13:25.779
what one rogue agent can accomplish.

13:25.814 --> 13:27.447
Now, can you imagine

13:27.482 --> 13:30.082
what a conspiracy of them could do?

13:31.820 --> 13:33.320
Can we rely on you?

13:35.123 --> 13:37.023
_

13:44.265 --> 13:46.265
Lydia.

13:46.301 --> 13:47.733
Um, hi.

13:47.768 --> 13:49.630
Figured we should get to know each other

13:49.631 --> 13:51.537
since we're the only women here.

13:51.572 --> 13:52.805
Oh, there might be more.

13:52.841 --> 13:55.041
We're not the only recruits
testing today.

13:55.076 --> 13:56.075
Um, I'm Alex...

13:56.110 --> 13:57.176
Alex Parrish.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.712
You're not someone who ever
has to introduce herself.

13:59.747 --> 14:02.247
Why do you even have to go
through this? You're a shoo-in.

14:02.282 --> 14:04.950
Yeah, well, depends on
what "this" entails.

14:04.985 --> 14:08.620
Physical, personality tests,
polygraphs, and a psych eval.

14:08.656 --> 14:10.956
I interview a lot of ex-Company
for my work.

14:10.991 --> 14:14.993
Jeremy Miller... famous author
of the "Skyforce" series

14:15.028 --> 14:17.295
and now living it in real life.

14:17.331 --> 14:19.831
Apparently, my scenarios
were so accurate,

14:19.867 --> 14:22.234
they recruited me to
come up with new ones.

14:22.269 --> 14:23.168
And you are...?

14:23.203 --> 14:25.337
Not a fan of yet
another male action hero

14:25.372 --> 14:26.671
with a long-suffering wife

14:26.706 --> 14:28.663
who prays he makes it
through his next mission.

14:28.811 --> 14:30.019
Well, thank you for reading them.

14:32.679 --> 14:35.112
Hope your research pays off...

14:35.147 --> 14:37.114
'cause it ain't fiction.

14:50.829 --> 14:53.630
That man is staring at me.

14:53.665 --> 14:57.167
Stare right back. Everyone else is.

14:57.203 --> 14:58.269
You got your own admirer.

15:00.172 --> 15:02.306
Not your type?

15:02.341 --> 15:04.207
This is nothing like the Bureau.

15:04.242 --> 15:05.219
I mean, don't get me wrong.

15:05.243 --> 15:08.144
All those people were
in great shape, but this?

15:08.179 --> 15:10.947
It's like a
CrossFit leaderboard in here.

15:10.982 --> 15:13.016
The only time I went to SoulCycle,

15:13.051 --> 15:15.786
I ended up in the E.R.,
hooked to an I.V.

15:15.821 --> 15:17.554
I'm so not gonna do well here.

15:19.157 --> 15:21.057
Are you a good person?

15:21.092 --> 15:21.791
Yes.

15:21.826 --> 15:23.226
Who says no?

15:23.261 --> 15:26.329
Have you ever felt
like no one believes you?

15:29.200 --> 15:32.168
Have you ever committed a crime
for which you weren't caught?

15:32.203 --> 15:36.472
Only in Kansas, Kentucky, and Texas.

15:36.507 --> 15:38.707
Ever damaged government property?

15:38.743 --> 15:41.043
Does peeing in Central Park count?

15:41.078 --> 15:43.312
Have you ever deceived a family member?

15:43.347 --> 15:44.246
Yes.

15:44.281 --> 15:46.214
I'm doing so right now.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.651
Ever looked at pornography?

15:48.686 --> 15:51.053
Have you updated these
questions since Truman?

15:55.092 --> 15:58.393
Have you ever aided
a terrorist in any way?

15:58.429 --> 16:00.562
Okay, you got me.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.564
"What color best describes you?"

16:02.599 --> 16:05.267
How do you even answer a question
like that correctly?

16:05.302 --> 16:07.113
I'm pretty sure it's subjective,
and if it isn't,

16:07.137 --> 16:08.581
then I am really freaking out right now.

16:08.605 --> 16:10.204
All right, just relax, okay?

16:10.239 --> 16:12.173
You're more in control than you let on.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.241
The CIA is gonna see that.

16:16.446 --> 16:19.280
Is it some moth-to-a-flame
thing, or do you know that guy?

16:19.315 --> 16:21.293
I just met him a few times
at the Bureau. That's it.

16:21.317 --> 16:22.923
Surprised to see someone I know.

16:23.072 --> 16:25.119
Well, good to see you again, Ryan Booth.

16:25.154 --> 16:25.987
This is Lydia, um...

16:26.022 --> 16:28.289
I'm sorry. I don't know your last name.

16:28.324 --> 16:31.092
Rumor is, we're not
supposed to have them.

16:31.127 --> 16:31.859
It's Bates.

16:31.894 --> 16:32.893
Nice to meet you.

16:32.928 --> 16:33.794
Pleasure's mine.

16:33.829 --> 16:36.197
Something else we're
not supposed to have.

16:36.232 --> 16:37.264
No, that was in the FBI.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.700
Apparently, in here, we
can do whatever we want.

16:39.735 --> 16:41.302
Noted.

16:41.337 --> 16:43.103
Thankfully.

16:45.975 --> 16:49.142
My name is Owen Hall,

16:49.177 --> 16:51.311
and if you make it into The Farm today,

16:51.346 --> 16:53.046
I will be your lead instructor,

16:53.081 --> 16:55.716
a position I've held
for the last 14 years.

16:55.751 --> 16:58.752
The CIA only recruits those
we believe can help our mission.

16:58.787 --> 17:02.322
As such, I've hand-selected
everyone in this room.

17:02.357 --> 17:06.326
I saw something in each one
of you that makes you valuable.

17:06.361 --> 17:08.395
And before this day is over,

17:08.430 --> 17:11.131
some will prove me right and move in,

17:11.165 --> 17:13.233
and others will be sent home.

17:13.268 --> 17:15.635
The NSA and FBI want to
make sure you have no secrets.

17:15.670 --> 17:19.471
We here at The Farm need
to know you can keep them.

17:19.507 --> 17:22.340
All right, one by one, you'll
be asked the same 20 questions

17:22.376 --> 17:24.644
you were asked earlier
during the polygraph,

17:24.679 --> 17:28.013
only this time, you will tell
a lie instead of the truth.

17:28.049 --> 17:31.584
If you can't tell a lie and get
away with it, we will know.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.318
And you will hear a very unpleasant...

17:34.621 --> 17:37.089
If I hear more than five buzzes...

17:37.124 --> 17:39.124
adios.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.193
Is your father alive?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.194
No.

17:43.030 --> 17:46.131
Did you spend two years in prison?

17:46.167 --> 17:47.533
No.

17:47.568 --> 17:50.035
Do you respond well to authority?

17:50.070 --> 17:50.802
Yes.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.872
Is your name Ryan Booth?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.106
Nope.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.207
Do you have three sisters?

17:56.242 --> 17:56.942
No.

17:56.977 --> 17:58.509
Did you grow up in Hawthorne?

17:58.545 --> 17:59.778
Nope.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.345
Were you in Afghanistan?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.447
No, sir.

18:03.550 --> 18:07.918
Huh. No one's ever gotten
a perfect score before.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.522
Nothing turns me on
more than some mystery.

18:11.558 --> 18:16.127
That right there might be
a too talented Mr. Ripley.

18:16.801 --> 18:18.938
_

18:26.947 --> 18:29.315
_

18:34.299 --> 18:36.116
_

18:36.117 --> 18:37.158
What are you doing here, Raina?

18:37.182 --> 18:39.048
I'm an interpreter for the summit.

18:39.084 --> 18:39.849
Where is Alex?

18:39.884 --> 18:41.851
I knew she was coming to see you.

18:41.886 --> 18:44.421
She might still be in the area.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.423
Well, let's hope,
for her sake, she's not.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.125
I hope for ours she is.

18:48.372 --> 18:52.694
_

18:54.433 --> 18:55.464
I do.

19:03.441 --> 19:05.541
"We are the Citizen's Liberation Front.

19:05.576 --> 19:07.844
We've taken control
of a five-block radius

19:07.879 --> 19:09.045
in lower Manhattan..."

19:09.080 --> 19:10.412
"And our demand is simple."

19:11.315 --> 19:13.582
"There are individuals around the world

19:13.618 --> 19:18.053
who were unjustly persecuted
for breaches of global security,

19:18.088 --> 19:21.257
and before the day ends,
they have to be pardoned,

19:21.292 --> 19:22.691
or many will die."

19:22.726 --> 19:24.762
"Any attempt to cross our perimeter

19:24.908 --> 19:27.396
will result in the release
of a biological agent

19:27.431 --> 19:29.031
that will devastate the area.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.799
Please await further instructions."

19:30.834 --> 19:34.369
"If you obey, it will be over soon.

19:34.404 --> 19:36.304
We will begin with America."

19:36.339 --> 19:39.541
The United States
does not bow to terrorists,

19:39.576 --> 19:40.642
and neither do I.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.212
Then they will execute your wife.

19:44.394 --> 19:47.523
_

20:15.952 --> 20:18.819
They're speaking Swahili,
but judging from their accents,

20:18.854 --> 20:21.422
none of them are remotely
from that region.

20:21.457 --> 20:24.425
I've never heard of the Citizen's
Liberation Front before. Have you?

20:24.460 --> 20:25.859
No.

20:25.895 --> 20:28.595
These guys are
well-trained and way too organized

20:28.631 --> 20:30.764
for this to be a first run.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.966
Doesn't add up.

20:32.001 --> 20:34.035
What are you going to do?

20:34.070 --> 20:36.937
What I was trained to do... lie.

20:38.574 --> 20:40.206
I'm special advisor to the president.

20:40.242 --> 20:41.953
If you want him to comply
with your demands,

20:41.977 --> 20:43.777
you're gonna need my help
getting him there.

20:44.859 --> 20:46.734
_

20:46.849 --> 20:49.950
Elicitation... the art
of extracting information

20:49.985 --> 20:52.618
from a target without raising
their suspicion.

20:52.654 --> 20:54.187
This is the site of your final test...

20:54.222 --> 20:56.823
Williamsburg's Gold Leaf Bar and Grill.

20:56.858 --> 20:58.358
You'll each be handed a card

20:58.393 --> 21:00.293
with one single item written on it.

21:00.329 --> 21:02.028
This item is a key piece of information

21:02.064 --> 21:03.663
about a fellow recruit.

21:03.698 --> 21:05.898
Your goal is to figure out what it means

21:05.934 --> 21:07.762
and match it to the correct recruit

21:07.763 --> 21:10.202
by writing their name
on the back of the card.

21:10.237 --> 21:12.403
When trying to elicit from a target,

21:12.439 --> 21:16.007
you want to make sure your mark
is relaxed and comfortable.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.509
So drink up.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.826
The booze is on us.

21:21.372 --> 21:23.047
My card just says "Cleveland."

21:23.083 --> 21:24.850
Like, is that a name or the city?

21:24.885 --> 21:26.585
And now we all know what you have.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.887
Elicitation's about
not raising suspicion.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.890
But, you guys, no one's gonna
give up too much on themselves anyway.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.646
But you can't expect
to get info on someone

21:34.647 --> 21:36.339
without giving up information
about yourself.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.928
So how do we win?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.930
Well, by getting well and truly drunk

21:39.966 --> 21:42.033
until somebody slips up.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.734
Let's do it.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.038
Her name was Hannah.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.875
She was smart, beautiful, strong...

21:50.910 --> 21:52.943
Stronger than I'll ever be.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.880
We were talking about
starting a family together.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.247
Mm.

21:57.282 --> 22:00.583
And then... car accident.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.420
One day she was there, and then...

22:06.158 --> 22:08.091
What about you? You ever
lose anyone you love?

22:08.127 --> 22:10.827
Mm. My husband and our two sons.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.264
That's... That's
how you do it, isn't it?

22:14.299 --> 22:16.466
Your B-plus story and your
C-minus conviction.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.367
If you're gonna give me the widow trick,

22:18.403 --> 22:21.037
please give me something I
haven't seen on American telly.

22:21.072 --> 22:23.150
Anyone ever tell you you
have a really thick accent

22:23.174 --> 22:23.907
for an American?

22:23.942 --> 22:26.413
Everyone... Apart from my mum,

22:26.573 --> 22:28.422
who moved us back to London
after I was born.

22:28.446 --> 22:29.946
Excuse me.

22:29.981 --> 22:33.149
Tragic story about your ex-wife.

22:33.184 --> 22:34.950
I wonder what she'd make of it.

22:34.985 --> 22:35.896
Should we call her and ask?

22:35.920 --> 22:38.954
Elicit without being
elicited is the point.

22:38.989 --> 22:40.956
Lying isn't the only strategy.

22:40.991 --> 22:42.538
I'm playing it close to the vest.

22:42.716 --> 22:45.428
Plus, I already have a hunch on my card.

22:45.463 --> 22:48.497
Mm, well, why don't you play it
your way, I'll play it mine,

22:48.533 --> 22:50.732
and I hope to see you on the other side?

22:50.768 --> 22:53.268
Oh! I will be there.

22:53.303 --> 22:56.905
Actually, I got the Edgar
for the first "Skyforce" novel

22:56.941 --> 22:59.074
when I was living hand-to-mouth

22:59.109 --> 23:01.142
as a high-school English teacher.

23:01.178 --> 23:03.144
Jeremy Miller?

23:03.180 --> 23:05.280
Jeremy freakin'
Miller... The millennial Tom Clancy?

23:05.315 --> 23:06.281
Wow. I am a big fan.

23:06.316 --> 23:07.449
Do you know who this guy is?

23:07.484 --> 23:08.816
Do you fancy a chat?

23:10.387 --> 23:11.809
I was getting somewhere with him.

23:11.810 --> 23:12.814
Yeah, on the road to elimination.

23:12.815 --> 23:14.033
That was a total cock-up.

23:14.057 --> 23:16.257
Don't give information about yourself.

23:16.293 --> 23:19.026
You're... helping me? Why?

23:19.062 --> 23:21.196
You have an honest face.

23:21.231 --> 23:22.964
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a good thing.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.610
Till you have a
dishonest heart to go with it,

23:24.634 --> 23:26.178
you're gonna have to learn
how to cut corners.

23:26.202 --> 23:29.604
Now, do you know why
barmen never go home with anyone?

23:29.639 --> 23:32.873
'Cause they've seen everything.

23:36.012 --> 23:37.478
Talk to him.

23:37.513 --> 23:40.280
Wesley is from Mobile,
Robin is cheating on his wife,

23:40.316 --> 23:44.184
and León is uncircumcised,
which I didn't hear from him.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.153
What did you have to
share to get all that?

23:46.188 --> 23:47.521
Nice try.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.523
Look, I'm just doing my due diligence.

23:49.558 --> 23:52.025
Besides, I've already pinned
the card on my donkey.

23:52.060 --> 23:53.827
Cards up so we can talk freely?

23:55.897 --> 23:56.930
Okay.

23:58.233 --> 24:01.801
I don't know any other Andy
except... Warhol and Cohen.

24:02.938 --> 24:05.105
- Guess we can chat.
- Yeah, this isn't mine, either.

24:08.276 --> 24:09.009
Another game?

24:09.044 --> 24:09.954
You gonna actually try this time,

24:09.978 --> 24:11.978
or you really think that letting me win

24:12.014 --> 24:13.224
is gonna get me to give something?

24:13.248 --> 24:15.080
Oh, I'm that transparent, huh?

24:15.116 --> 24:18.251
You and Alex... deeper history
than a shared employer.

24:18.286 --> 24:20.353
Yeah. We brought down
Liam O'Connor together.

24:20.388 --> 24:21.450
But that's not what's in your eyes

24:21.452 --> 24:22.733
every time you hear her name.

24:22.757 --> 24:24.923
She might not be the
card you were holding,

24:24.959 --> 24:26.859
but she's your key piece
of information...

24:26.894 --> 24:28.127
Your weakness.

24:28.163 --> 24:30.462
I was holding back.
This time, you're going down.

24:31.565 --> 24:34.332
So, how does an ex-actuary

24:34.368 --> 24:37.202
take a swing at a job like this?

24:37.237 --> 24:38.904
My mom was an alcoholic.

24:38.939 --> 24:41.874
I never knew what she'd
bring home with her...

24:41.909 --> 24:44.276
A man, a few.

24:44.311 --> 24:46.744
Sometimes she never came home at all.

24:46.780 --> 24:50.348
Living like that made me grow up fast...

24:50.384 --> 24:55.053
Responsible, sober, always
on call, never spoke up,

24:55.088 --> 24:58.623
never went to a house party,
never jumped in a pool,

24:58.659 --> 25:00.525
never even learned to swim.

25:00.561 --> 25:02.426
So I'm here to prove to myself

25:02.461 --> 25:05.697
that I am capable of taking risks.

25:05.732 --> 25:07.264
And I am not afraid.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.901
I don't see any fear in those eyes.

25:10.904 --> 25:12.970
You got this.

25:13.006 --> 25:16.074
Means a lot... coming from
the great Alex Parrish.

25:16.109 --> 25:17.809
Mm.

25:17.844 --> 25:20.244
Why are you here?

25:20.279 --> 25:24.215
After everything
that happened last year...

25:24.250 --> 25:26.950
the world called me a hero,

25:26.985 --> 25:29.386
but I never felt like one.

25:29.422 --> 25:31.722
I missed signs, made mistakes.

25:31.757 --> 25:34.425
Friends died.

25:34.460 --> 25:37.761
My best friend died, actually.

25:37.796 --> 25:40.731
So, while the world might call me great,

25:40.766 --> 25:44.334
all I feel is guilty.

25:44.369 --> 25:47.904
So I'm here... to actually
become the hero

25:47.940 --> 25:50.240
the world already thinks I am.

25:52.310 --> 25:56.011
Hand in your cards.
Let's see who's still standing.

25:56.047 --> 26:01.584
Manus, Garabedian,
Springer, Velez, Ellis, Doyle, Booth,

26:01.620 --> 26:03.453
you all correctly matched your cards

26:03.488 --> 26:04.954
to the proper recruit.

26:04.989 --> 26:07.089
The following people, step forward...

26:07.125 --> 26:08.901
Manus, Heyward, Steiner,

26:09.069 --> 26:12.361
Springer, Garabedian, and Gordon.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.131
A van is waiting in the parking
lot to take you to the airport.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.031
Go.

26:16.067 --> 26:17.233
Why am I out?

26:17.268 --> 26:20.002
You just said I matched my
card to the correct recruit.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.371
Yeah, but another
recruit got information from you

26:22.406 --> 26:23.873
to match their card back to you.

26:23.908 --> 26:27.142
Sorry, Springer. I did
enjoy our little chat.

26:27.177 --> 26:29.544
Call you when I'm done here? Yeah?

26:29.580 --> 26:32.648
The true aim of the
exercise wasn't eliciting information

26:32.683 --> 26:35.384
out of each other, but
who was able to protect

26:35.419 --> 26:37.486
their own information from getting out.

26:37.521 --> 26:40.054
The winners never gave yourselves up.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.623
No one matched a card to you. Very good.

26:42.659 --> 26:43.658
How did you know?

26:43.693 --> 26:45.226
Well, look, when I go out,

26:45.262 --> 26:47.461
I get numbers and I never give mine.

26:47.497 --> 26:49.898
I just figured the same
rules apply here.

26:49.933 --> 26:52.033
You're not done with your final test.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.001
Sober up quickly.

26:53.036 --> 26:56.805
In one hour, you're jumping
out of a plane.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.318
Now it's a party.

27:12.121 --> 27:13.253
What are you doing in here?

27:13.289 --> 27:14.888
Mr. President, I lied.

27:14.924 --> 27:17.424
I told them I can convince you
to communicate their demands.

27:17.459 --> 27:20.427
Well, you're about to
prove very persuasive.

27:20.462 --> 27:23.330
As much as it pains me, I
intend to do exactly that.

27:23.365 --> 27:25.265
No. You can't give in.

27:25.301 --> 27:27.935
Don't do this to protect me.

27:27.970 --> 27:29.937
When you swore to serve this country,

27:29.972 --> 27:31.671
it was an oath we took together.

27:31.707 --> 27:35.174
And if I don't give in,
they kill you, start on me,

27:35.210 --> 27:36.743
then the rest of the world leaders,

27:36.778 --> 27:38.578
sending the world into
chaos without end.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.013
Sir, I thought you and
Vice President Haas

27:41.049 --> 27:41.948
had a firm policy...

27:41.983 --> 27:44.384
America doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

27:44.419 --> 27:46.686
Don't be naive. We always have.

27:46.722 --> 27:49.388
The world just doesn't know about it.

27:49.423 --> 27:50.511
Time is up.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.002
My aide can assist you

27:52.026 --> 27:54.460
in setting up a pardon for Eric Boyer.

27:54.495 --> 27:56.428
Not to me. To the people.

27:56.646 --> 27:57.796
What?

27:59.433 --> 28:01.868
Your effort won't be forgotten, Ryan.

28:01.903 --> 28:02.948
Thank you.

28:07.292 --> 28:08.799
Good morning.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.015
This is your president speaking.

28:11.051 --> 28:13.417
Moments ago, the G20 Summit
was taken hostage

28:13.453 --> 28:16.520
by an armed militia called
the Citizen's Liberation Front.

28:16.556 --> 28:18.422
We are being held in Federal Plaza,

28:18.458 --> 28:20.391
and I am assured
there will be no casualties

28:20.426 --> 28:23.160
as long as the United
States grants the immediate release

28:23.196 --> 28:24.295
of one Eric Boyer.

28:24.330 --> 28:27.998
If we don't, my wife will be
the first to be executed.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.233
I am ordering a full
presidential pardon of Boyer

28:30.268 --> 28:32.936
to spare the lives of
these brave men and women inside

28:32.972 --> 28:34.771
to put an end to this hostage crisis

28:34.807 --> 28:36.673
before anyone is killed.

28:36.709 --> 28:39.042
Thank you.

28:39.078 --> 28:40.410
God bless America.

29:22.786 --> 29:25.654
This is a C-47B Skytrain aircraft.

29:25.689 --> 29:28.990
We are cruising at an altitude
of 15,000 feet.

29:29.026 --> 29:33.295
You are about to embark on a
high-altitude, low-opening jump.

29:33.330 --> 29:34.996
This is HALO school,

29:35.032 --> 29:37.398
and I will be your jumpmaster
for this course.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.300
It is a test of your courage.

29:39.335 --> 29:43.337
Now, mark 60 seconds on the
watch altimeter we gave you.

29:43.373 --> 29:47.275
When I say "Go," start the
timer and exit the aircraft.

29:47.310 --> 29:49.678
You have approximately 60
seconds to pull your chute

29:49.713 --> 29:51.345
before you reach unsafe altitude,

29:51.381 --> 29:53.481
and I don't have to
tell you what happens

29:53.516 --> 29:54.915
if you don't pull them in time.

29:54.950 --> 29:55.916
Is everyone clear?

29:55.951 --> 29:57.185
- Clear, sir.
- Yes. - Yeah.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.287
Forget the watch. I need new pants.

29:59.322 --> 30:01.289
Do you think Jake Eagle would be scared?

30:01.324 --> 30:02.290
Jake Eagle is fictional.

30:02.325 --> 30:04.625
Do you want to write
about things or live them?

30:04.661 --> 30:06.126
I want to live to write about them.

30:06.162 --> 30:06.960
Yeah?

30:06.996 --> 30:08.261
This is your adventure now.

30:08.297 --> 30:11.364
Don't think about it. Just do it.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.299
I'll go first!

30:12.334 --> 30:13.167
Brave.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.202
Yeah, yeah, it's not my first time.

30:15.237 --> 30:18.271
You just got to close your eyes and go.

30:18.307 --> 30:19.139
Eh?

30:19.175 --> 30:20.841
He'll be right behind me.

30:30.852 --> 30:32.285
Go!

30:32.321 --> 30:33.453
I can't do it.

30:33.488 --> 30:35.255
Now or never, Miller.

30:39.261 --> 30:40.292
I can't!

30:40.328 --> 30:42.695
All right. You're going home.

30:42.731 --> 30:44.230
Who's next? Let's go!

30:44.265 --> 30:45.965
León, you're up.

30:48.036 --> 30:49.501
My harness isn't connecting.

30:49.537 --> 30:51.537
What? Let me see.

30:52.846 --> 30:54.218
You need to tell Owen.

30:54.242 --> 30:56.408
- Go!
- And risk getting cut? No way.

30:56.444 --> 30:57.721
You saw what just happened to Jeremy.

30:57.745 --> 30:58.777
Are you kidding?

30:58.812 --> 31:01.680
There's a big difference
between bravery and suicide.

31:01.716 --> 31:04.082
You're gonna fall
when this chute engages.

31:04.118 --> 31:06.318
You need to go and
tell Owen... Get it fixed.

31:06.354 --> 31:07.586
Go! Tell him!

31:07.622 --> 31:09.321
Bates! Let's go!

31:12.926 --> 31:13.903
Well, I'm glad you made a friend.

31:13.927 --> 31:15.927
I'm just trying to
keep myself away from you.

31:15.963 --> 31:17.907
Yeah, well, it's not working,
'cause León has pieced together

31:17.931 --> 31:19.508
that we're a little bit more
than just colleagues.

31:19.532 --> 31:22.267
I'd be lying if I didn't say
this was a little weird for me,

31:22.302 --> 31:24.669
watching you slip in and out
of your cover so perfectly,

31:24.704 --> 31:25.937
being able to lie so easily.

31:25.973 --> 31:27.239
I mean, it just...

31:27.274 --> 31:28.840
We were in such a good place, Ryan.

31:28.876 --> 31:30.675
Yeah... With you lying to me.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.777
When did Keyes contact you, huh?

31:32.812 --> 31:33.745
February.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.112
Oh, w...

31:35.148 --> 31:36.547
- Six months ago?
- Shh!

31:36.583 --> 31:38.894
Well, if anybody should be
having trust issues, it's me, not you.

31:38.918 --> 31:39.762
I didn't have a choice.

31:39.786 --> 31:41.286
No, I didn't have a choice, either.

31:41.321 --> 31:43.053
You think I want you
seeing this side of me?

31:43.089 --> 31:44.909
You think I want you doubting me again?

31:45.074 --> 31:48.725
Alex, I never want you doubting
how much I love you.

31:48.761 --> 31:51.228
Before you ran off last
night, I was gonna let you know that.

31:51.264 --> 31:52.129
How?

31:52.165 --> 31:53.597
Go!

31:55.601 --> 31:57.567
Lydia, no!

32:05.994 --> 32:07.178
Let her go!

32:07.180 --> 32:09.695
I can't! Her rigging's not latched!

32:09.731 --> 32:12.231
We gotta bring you back in!

32:12.266 --> 32:13.733
Take my hand!

32:13.768 --> 32:15.134
You can do it!

32:15.169 --> 32:17.537
I will not let you go! Take my hand!

32:17.572 --> 32:20.740
I can't! I can't!

32:23.678 --> 32:24.911
Here! Grab my pack!

32:24.946 --> 32:26.712
- Ryan! Aah!
- Come on, Lydia!

32:32.553 --> 32:34.886
Hey. Try not to do that again.

32:34.922 --> 32:36.655
You two still have to go.

32:54.808 --> 32:57.742
Well, you all made it.

32:57.778 --> 32:59.177
Very good.

32:59.212 --> 33:00.511
Alex, come forward.

33:00.547 --> 33:02.746
Maybe he's got a Silver Star handy.

33:02.782 --> 33:03.847
Shut up.

33:03.883 --> 33:07.585
Don't you ever ignore
my instructions again.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.253
You interfered with a fellow recruit.

33:09.289 --> 33:11.033
Had it been an op, you
would've compromised it.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.724
I'm sorry. I saved her life.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.126
No, you didn't.

33:15.161 --> 33:18.028
I've made that jump 57 times.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.363
I'm not a recruit.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.099
I'm a case officer...

33:22.134 --> 33:24.768
And your co-instructor.

33:24.804 --> 33:26.303
I put myself amongst you

33:26.338 --> 33:28.606
to observe you throughout the day.

33:28.641 --> 33:30.574
So there was nothing wrong
with your rigging.

33:30.610 --> 33:31.642
No, it was a test

33:31.677 --> 33:34.711
to see who would try and
play a hero during an op.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.713
I had a feeling it might be you.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.449
And after that little story
you told at the bar,

33:39.485 --> 33:40.650
I was certain.

33:40.685 --> 33:44.287
The FBI might train you to be a hero,

33:44.323 --> 33:48.158
but in the Agency,
the mission comes first.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.326
You don't.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.495
Bit of an extreme example, isn't it?

33:52.530 --> 33:54.230
Or not enough of one.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.798
I've watched operatives
get shot right in front of me,

33:56.834 --> 34:01.302
and if you even blink, you're next.

34:01.338 --> 34:02.470
That said,

34:02.506 --> 34:06.842
everyone standing here
just barely made the final cut.

34:06.877 --> 34:08.309
Welcome to The Farm.

34:08.344 --> 34:09.344
Lydia will show you

34:09.379 --> 34:11.478
where you'll be living
for the next six months.

34:16.152 --> 34:18.418
Your mother wasn't
an alcoholic, was she?

34:18.455 --> 34:19.754
You just read up on me.

34:19.789 --> 34:21.688
Do you think this is the Girl Scouts,

34:21.724 --> 34:23.358
where we're all in it together?

34:23.393 --> 34:25.659
This is the Central Intelligence Agency.

34:25.695 --> 34:28.596
You're not training to be a border guard

34:28.632 --> 34:30.665
or a beat cop or an FBI agent.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.000
You're training to be a case officer.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.333
If you do it right,

34:34.370 --> 34:36.704
you'll be forced to make tough choices

34:36.739 --> 34:39.639
that could save countless
lives every day,

34:39.676 --> 34:41.809
and you'll be doing it on your own.

34:41.844 --> 34:44.945
I believe in
trusting the people around me.

34:44.981 --> 34:46.480
Without them,

34:46.514 --> 34:48.549
last year would've
turned out very differently.

34:48.583 --> 34:52.118
If you ask me, last year
could've been prevented.

34:52.154 --> 34:54.487
The FBI reacts when something happens.

34:54.523 --> 34:56.523
We stop it from ever getting that far.

34:56.559 --> 34:59.826
Think of all the people
who would still be in your life

34:59.861 --> 35:02.195
if you did what I do.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.531
Oh, and, by the way, you had my card.

35:05.567 --> 35:08.334
Andy was my favorite Goonie.

35:53.913 --> 35:56.414
Who are you, and what do you want?

35:56.450 --> 35:58.383
What are you planning?

35:58.418 --> 35:59.851
Answer me!

36:03.923 --> 36:05.757
Jeremy?

36:05.792 --> 36:09.193
How is that
possible? You... You're dead.

36:09.229 --> 36:11.462
You're wrong about a lot of things,

36:11.497 --> 36:12.764
aren't you?

36:12.799 --> 36:16.567
Well, if you think you can stop this,

36:16.602 --> 36:17.935
you're wrong about that, too.

36:19.605 --> 36:23.274
I only wish you hadn't been here.

36:23.309 --> 36:25.242
Now you're gonna have to die, too.

36:26.746 --> 36:28.000
Jeremy!

36:43.023 --> 36:45.690
You almost died today.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.427
And you almost got pulled out with me.

36:50.064 --> 36:52.030
Can we really pull this off?

36:52.066 --> 36:54.799
Six months of lying to each other?

36:56.035 --> 36:57.201
We've done that before.

36:58.371 --> 37:00.037
I hate it.

37:00.073 --> 37:02.006
I hate it, too.

37:02.041 --> 37:04.508
I mean, I can learn how to lie better,

37:04.543 --> 37:06.710
how not to trust the people around me,

37:06.745 --> 37:09.613
but we're in such a good place.

37:09.648 --> 37:12.083
I don't want to have
to lie to you again.

37:15.153 --> 37:17.688
How were you gonna make
sure I never doubted you?

37:26.899 --> 37:29.032
Stop. Oh, my God.

37:29.067 --> 37:32.268
I... I don't want to see it.

37:33.105 --> 37:35.438
Not yet.

37:36.241 --> 37:38.975
When this mission's complete

37:39.011 --> 37:42.312
and when we've gone
through this together,

37:42.347 --> 37:44.147
show me then.

37:44.182 --> 37:45.348
Okay.

37:47.251 --> 37:50.085
And even though we have to lie
to everyone else back there,

37:50.121 --> 37:52.221
we don't have to lie to each other.

37:52.256 --> 37:54.856
Here, in this room,
this'll be the one place

37:54.892 --> 37:57.226
we always tell each other the truth.

37:57.261 --> 37:58.427
I love you.

37:58.462 --> 37:59.628
And I love you.

38:05.235 --> 38:06.972
The Central Intelligence Agency

38:07.108 --> 38:09.237
will teach you how to be someone else...

38:09.272 --> 38:12.240
For all intents and
purposes, a criminal.

38:12.275 --> 38:15.076
Everything you'll learn
is a capital offense

38:15.111 --> 38:17.679
in every country, including this one.

38:17.714 --> 38:21.249
For the next six months, you'll
train in the art of deceit,

38:21.284 --> 38:24.452
learn tradecraft,
and paramilitary skills

38:24.487 --> 38:27.355
to ensure that those of you
who become case officers

38:27.390 --> 38:29.123
have what it takes to survive.

38:29.159 --> 38:31.292
You'll notice you've been
joined by two other groups,

38:31.327 --> 38:33.794
who passed the same tests this week.

38:33.829 --> 38:35.967
And while you didn't get
a chance to meet each other,

38:35.968 --> 38:37.565
you'll soon be well-acquainted.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.100
Every week, we do a class ranking,

38:40.135 --> 38:43.070
affectionately known
as the Murder Board,

38:43.105 --> 38:45.773
so that everyone knows where they stand.

38:45.808 --> 38:50.243
If you're at the bottom
more than once, that's it.

38:50.279 --> 38:51.566
This week...

38:58.153 --> 38:59.619
Good luck.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.156
You'll need it.

39:10.999 --> 39:13.232
Bicol Express...

39:13.267 --> 39:16.102
Vacuum-packed, straight from Malate.

39:16.137 --> 39:17.236
Thought you'd enjoy it.

39:17.271 --> 39:19.138
Ah.

39:19.173 --> 39:21.507
One of these days,
customs is gonna catch you.

39:22.410 --> 39:25.444
Whoever they catch, it won't be me.

39:30.985 --> 39:32.564
Could you grab this for me, Dad?

39:32.716 --> 39:34.320
Yeah.

39:38.126 --> 39:41.627
They put the top two in the
class in the same room.

39:41.662 --> 39:43.762
Since I'm number one,
you mind if I choose a side?

39:43.797 --> 39:46.064
Sure. Go ahead.

39:48.736 --> 39:51.870
You know, I got no intention
of being number one.

39:51.905 --> 39:54.572
Put yourself in first place,
all eyes are on you.

39:56.243 --> 39:59.277
You know, Alex and me... You were right.

39:59.312 --> 40:01.312
But it's history and it's private,

40:01.348 --> 40:03.559
and I don't want to wreck her
chances here on a technicality.

40:03.583 --> 40:05.950
I got it. You can trust me.

40:07.354 --> 40:09.187
So...

40:09.222 --> 40:12.190
what were you in prison for?

40:12.225 --> 40:14.825
Didn't say I trusted you.

40:14.861 --> 40:16.393
Uh...

40:16.428 --> 40:20.131
I hope you don't mind,
but I sleep naked.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.332
Hope you don't mind. I pray.

41:15.319 --> 41:16.718
He's out.

41:21.558 --> 41:24.125
Boyer has been granted his pardon.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.293
You've done well.

41:26.763 --> 41:28.930
"It's time for the next phase."

41:30.633 --> 41:32.022
What are they saying now?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.879
They're counting. We're being separated.

41:33.903 --> 41:36.254
How are you planning
on this working, huh?

41:36.255 --> 41:37.750
There are hundreds of people here.

41:37.774 --> 41:38.751
There's only a dozen of you.

41:40.509 --> 41:42.309
"There are more of us here than that.

41:42.345 --> 41:43.577
You just can't see them."

41:43.613 --> 41:45.412
They're hiding among us, Ryan.

41:55.123 --> 41:56.294
_

41:56.359 --> 41:57.991
What are you doing?

41:58.026 --> 42:00.060
I did what you asked!

42:00.095 --> 42:02.562
At the very least, let my wife
and the other hostages go!

42:02.597 --> 42:05.431
Aah, aah! No! Aah!

42:05.467 --> 42:06.933
Wait! No!

42:06.969 --> 42:08.735
- Elaine! No!
- Stop!

42:08.771 --> 42:10.270
Mr. President, no!

42:10.305 --> 42:12.472
- No! No!
- Aah!

42:13.441 --> 42:14.775
No! No!
