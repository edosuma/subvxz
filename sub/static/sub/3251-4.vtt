21:13.175 --> 21:15.242
Not dead.
Dormant, maybe.

21:15.244 --> 21:16.677
Then why shut down?

21:33.015 --> 21:34.381

But since you
dropped us back here,

since you gave us
this house,

22:07.092 --> 22:08.592
you know,
we've built a life.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.794

22:10.796 --> 22:11.795
Why?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.630
Because they pull
at each other.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.833
Because they pull at me
and because the traveling

The cubes.

Come on.
