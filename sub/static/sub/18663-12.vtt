38:43.920 --> 38:45.559
<i>Please, acknowledge.</i>

39:00.880 --> 39:02.792
I got it!
Alex get me a clear shot!

39:02.960 --> 39:04.792
Let me go out there and see
if I can make contact.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.360
Whatever happens,
it's not on you...

39:06.440 --> 39:07.669
How are you gonna
make contact?

39:07.760 --> 39:09.399
You saw what it did
to those people in the lab.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.472
They had it in a prison.
I need to know.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.550
I can't let you do it.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.115
(ALARM BEEPING) - MAN:

Holden! The <i>Somnambulist</i> is
pushing off, they're underway!

39:22.280 --> 39:23.953
Things must've gotten
a lot worse on the ground.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.070
Screw this,
we're outta here.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.358
We're not going anywhere
till that thing is dead.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.909
Are you insane? We are in
a Martian No-Fly Zone

39:30.000 --> 39:31.957
and their Black Ops ship
just got blown to hell!

39:32.160 --> 39:33.514
The second the <i>Somnambulist</i>

39:33.640 --> 39:34.960
sticks its head
outta the station

39:35.040 --> 39:36.952
it's gonna get lit up!

39:37.920 --> 39:39.673
Naomi was right.
And you know it.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.514
This ain't
gonna end anything.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.919
And our family
needs our help right now.

MELISSA:
Unable to comply.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.519
The station is in collapse.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.115

40:12.160 --> 40:14.152

I got it.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.715
(LAUGHS) I got it.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.717
HOLDEN: Somnambulist,

41:13.800 --> 41:16.474
Status?
You're a son of a bitch!

41:17.320 --> 41:19.994
<i>- That's my status.</i>
- It's good to hear you, too.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.878
Hold on, kids.
It ain't over.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.480
We're being target-locked.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.631
Well, target-lock them back!
Every ship up there.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.359
Every PDC and torpedo
we've got.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.830
All right. She's bristling.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.436
Give me an open channel.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.070
Oh, man.
Here we go again.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.639
(SIGHS) Okay, you're live.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.353
This is the warship <i>Rocinante.</i>

41:46.760 --> 41:48.319
You're aware
of our capabilities

41:48.440 --> 41:49.840
more than anyone.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.913
We're escorting a vessel of
refugees away from your AO.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.997
Any ship
that opens fire on us

41:56.080 --> 41:57.833
will feel the sum total
of our state-of-the-art

41:57.920 --> 42:00.116
Martian arsenal,
rammed up its ass.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.353
We'll all die together.

This is our only and final warning,
stay clear.

(BEEPS)

42:09.680 --> 42:12.115
You know someone's gonna try

Nah. Not today.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.036
They're saving their bullets

42:23.600 --> 42:25.114
(SCOFFS) I'll be damned.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.873
When'd you
get so wise, Cap?

42:30.480 --> 42:31.516
I'll take it.
