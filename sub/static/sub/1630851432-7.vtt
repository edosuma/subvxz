WEBVTT

00:22.772 --> 00:24.899
They were supposed to be here
five minutes ago.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.651
-Willa, we're here!
-Finally!

00:26.735 --> 00:28.570
We need to go before my Dad stops us.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.572
Are we sure we should do this?

00:31.072 --> 00:32.907
Come on. What do you think is in there?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.913
Sh… We don't want my dad to hear us.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.957
-Hey!

00:41.041 --> 00:41.875
Oh, no…

00:41.958 --> 00:44.210
Breaking news from Dad

00:44.294 --> 00:47.464
I'm all signed up for
an online witchbuster course.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.382
Those witches are toast!

00:49.466 --> 00:52.635
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
messes with my little girl.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.680
Willa, you're going to have
that necklace back on you

00:55.764 --> 00:59.142
faster than you can say
Neil Witchbuster Ward!

01:01.644 --> 01:03.563
There's a witchbuster course?

01:03.646 --> 01:06.608
I wish my Dad was a witchbuster
instead of an accountant.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.903
Uh, any tips, you guys? Any, uh, advice?

01:09.986 --> 01:11.905
What does a dad
need to know about witches?

01:11.988 --> 01:16.159
Uh, maybe you should ask Miss Juniper!
She's a witchstorian, after all.

01:16.242 --> 01:20.205
Huh, a witchstorian.
Who'd have thunk that was even a thing.

01:20.288 --> 01:23.708
-Yeah!
-In fact, you should go now!

01:23.792 --> 01:25.085
-Good idea, Willa.
-Yeah!

01:25.168 --> 01:27.128
-Really? Now?
-Yeah.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.464
Okay, I'll go do that, and you girls,

01:29.547 --> 01:32.342
you stay right here at the house,
safe and sound, alright?

01:32.425 --> 01:34.844
Definitely not leaving
that door again today. Bye!

01:34.928 --> 01:35.970
Bye!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.764
Uh, bye!

01:39.390 --> 01:41.768
I'm gonna go see a witchstorian, I guess!

01:48.483 --> 01:50.777
We have to get that amulet back fast.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.029
Fink said if we needed help
to look in here!

01:53.113 --> 01:54.906
And we need help.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.993
Are we sure we want to? Have you read
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.121
There could be half-men-half-goats.

02:01.204 --> 02:05.083
As opposed to out here where we have
talking rats, cats and crows,

02:05.166 --> 02:06.668
and two evil witches!

02:06.751 --> 02:09.129
Check and mate.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.172
Lucky for us…

02:13.049 --> 02:16.010
We can sneak past
anything we find in there.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.307
Okay, we better make this quick.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.976
Let's do it!

02:30.191 --> 02:32.318
What is this place?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.572
Uh…

02:36.197 --> 02:39.367
Someplace very, extremely haunted!

02:39.450 --> 02:40.952
This was a huge mistake.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.872
-Agreed! Let's get out of here before--

02:45.165 --> 02:46.416
What?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.334
We're trapped here?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.974
Why would Fink send us here?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.727
I guess this is why they say
never trust a rat.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.812
Like we should have trusted anyone

03:49.896 --> 03:53.107
who told us to jump into
a swirling hole in a dark attic!

03:53.191 --> 03:56.736
Well, we're here now. We should
start looking for another way out.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.864
I mean, I really hope
there's another way out…

03:59.948 --> 04:01.407
You hope?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.831
Now that we have the amulet,

04:08.915 --> 04:12.669
we just need to make sure
that those repulsive little girls

04:12.752 --> 04:15.838
are out of our way for good,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.883
so they don't ruin our plan
down the road, but they're…

04:18.967 --> 04:21.511
-They're gone, they've vanished!

04:22.887 --> 04:24.055
-Wilma!

04:24.138 --> 04:25.974
Hey! Focus. Come on.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.853
They're hiding. They must know
we're coming back for them.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.563
Well, I suppose we did say that--

04:32.647 --> 04:36.067
We need something
more powerful to sniff them out.

04:36.150 --> 04:42.115
We'll get a beast with a nose for the job,
who can sniff them out.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.119
I am brilliant! I am really smart.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.870
-You really are.
-I am!

04:47.954 --> 04:50.540
-To the pet cemetery…

05:00.842 --> 05:03.511
Uh, did her eyes just move?

05:03.594 --> 05:05.013
Relax, scaredy-cat.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.389
It's only a statue.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.640
It can't hurt you.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.518
But maybe that can!

05:10.601 --> 05:12.103
It's ginormous!

05:12.186 --> 05:14.397
It's heading right for us!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.232
Stay back, whatever you are!

05:16.316 --> 05:17.817
Stay back! Shoo!

05:19.694 --> 05:20.528
Wait a sec.

05:20.611 --> 05:27.035
Willa, Scout, Lucy, so glad you're here.
We've been hoping you'd find your way.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.286
One-Whisker Pete?

05:28.369 --> 05:29.203
Whew!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.204
Whew.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.539
You scared us!

05:31.622 --> 05:33.291
Thank goodness it's you.

05:33.374 --> 05:37.337
I've never been so happy to see you,
you grumpy old floofer.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.466
What is this place?
And why did Fink send us here?

05:41.549 --> 05:46.429
All good questions,
and you will find out soon enough.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.015
The lady of the manor is expecting you.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.349
She is?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.185
She's in the lessons room.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.728
Please, this way.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.813
-Come on, guys.
-Okay…

05:59.067 --> 06:01.402
I thought Willa was
making up stories about witches,

06:01.486 --> 06:03.821
because maybe she needed
a little special attention.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.034
But all of a sudden, I find myself stuck
in a spooky Halloween show, and it's real.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.744
Witches are real!

06:09.827 --> 06:12.997
Tell me about it!
One, two, three, four, five. Yep.

06:13.081 --> 06:17.585
My whole life, just wishing, "Oh, please,
make witches real," and now they are!

06:17.668 --> 06:19.253
Isn't it fantastic?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.630
Well, no.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.256
Witches are after my kid!

06:22.340 --> 06:26.552
Well, with a little help from
her Dad and her favorite witchstorian,

06:26.636 --> 06:28.554
I think she's going to
beat those doofuses.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.597
I hope so.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.060
Oh! Thank you, Piggy, you are right!

06:34.143 --> 06:36.229
We can't forget the Wiccanpedia.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.111
Now this is essential reading.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.490
Yeah! Thanks, Piggy!

06:47.573 --> 06:48.866
Alrighty, off you go.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.701
Okay.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.579
-Whoa! Alright, alright.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.666
You've got it! Now, just turn
a little bit to your right, rotate.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.417
-Off you go!

07:06.050 --> 07:09.428
Perfect! This one ought to do.

07:09.512 --> 07:16.144
We summon you from your demise
Shadow hound, arise, arise!

07:16.227 --> 07:18.312
-Whoa!

07:18.396 --> 07:21.065
And I thought my old kennel was cramped.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.819
Oh, hi! I'm Snout.
Are you my new human best friends?!

07:24.902 --> 07:26.070
Hooray!

07:26.154 --> 07:30.366
Okay, fun facts about
I like tennis balls, chewing sticks…

07:30.450 --> 07:33.953
I thought we were summoning
an evil beast from the underworld.

07:34.036 --> 07:34.871
Well, it will be.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.374
Shadow hound, do our bidding.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.667
Shadow what now?

07:39.750 --> 07:42.795
Be mean and cruel
With lots of drool

07:42.879 --> 07:46.883
With a moan
To turn your enemies to stone!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.887
Yes!

07:50.970 --> 07:52.221
See? Evil, evil.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.473
Smell this.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.313
Now, hunt her down and bring her back!

08:01.481 --> 08:02.940
As you command.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.407
We have arrived.

08:11.491 --> 08:16.287
Um, could one of you get the door?
They're tricky with paws.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.372
Return the forms that we came from.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.462
In here, girls.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.089
Come along, quickly now.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.300
Madame will be joining us soon.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.302
Is it just me,

08:32.011 --> 08:35.556
or does the decor in here
look suspiciously witchy?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.893
Another fireplace.
Maybe we can get out there.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.230
Lucy? There's a fire in it!

08:45.358 --> 08:49.320
Allow me to introduce myself!
I'm Winnifred the Witch.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.239
Where did she come from?

08:51.822 --> 08:55.993
I'm so happy you're here!
I've been hoping you would come.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.620
You have?

08:57.703 --> 08:58.955
Indeed.

08:59.038 --> 09:03.417
We lost something very important,
and we need help getting it back.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.462
The amulet, yes.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.840
You have a great battle ahead of you.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.842
A great battle?

09:11.926 --> 09:15.179
Long ago, all witches were good.

09:15.263 --> 09:20.643
Then a few bad witches
started practicing dark magic.

09:20.726 --> 09:25.815
This battle between good and bad witches
has been waged for a millennia,

09:27.108 --> 09:31.779
with bad witches stopping at nothing
to destroy all the good witches!

09:31.862 --> 09:35.283
And they have very nearly succeeded!

09:35.366 --> 09:39.245
We are a dying breed, and you, Willa,

09:39.328 --> 09:43.124
are our last and final hope.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.834
How do you know who I am?

09:45.835 --> 09:48.796
There's much to learn.
We have very little time.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.216
Good luck, Willa. Don't worry about us.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.053
We will be keeping ourselves busy.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.471
Just a moment!

09:57.555 --> 10:03.311
You two also have much to learn,
so you can protect one another.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.981
But neither of us
have witches in our family.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.734
My mom's a dental hygienist.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.694
And my mom's a software engineer!

10:11.777 --> 10:15.698
Being a witch has
nothing to do with your lineage.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.703
To be a good witch
requires a great deal of courage.

10:20.786 --> 10:26.334
You must learn to use the powers
that are already inside you.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.418
What?

10:27.501 --> 10:28.502
Us?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.671
-Witches?!
-Yes!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.214
Let's begin!

10:39.013 --> 10:41.891
Sup, witchbusters.
Welcome to Witchbusting 101…

10:42.892 --> 10:46.395
…the first step on your path
to fighting dark magic in all its forms.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.314
-I'm Stugg Tuggins…
-Mm.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.857
…witchbuster first class.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.610
First things first, spotting a witch.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.655
They look like normal people,
except for a few telltale signs…

11:07.083 --> 11:08.542
Huh…

11:08.626 --> 11:11.754
Smells like
those nasty little girls came this way.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.674
Cool!

11:15.257 --> 11:16.592
Are you gonna give us wands?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.345
Wands are like the amulet:

11:19.428 --> 11:22.556
they're just a tool
to focus the magic inside you.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.184
You don't need a wand.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.769
You don't need an amulet!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.230
As for me though, I like a wand.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.483
-Whoa!

11:32.566 --> 11:35.361
Follow me! Pete, if you would.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.946
Ready, ma'am!

11:37.029 --> 11:38.489
Now, girls…

11:39.490 --> 11:41.992
Watch, listen and learn.

11:42.618 --> 11:46.330
Don't worry about me, girls.
I'm a professional.

11:46.414 --> 11:51.085
I wield the light and turn this brute
From something scary to something cute!

11:52.837 --> 11:55.423
-Aw!

11:55.506 --> 11:58.092
I'd like to think I was cuter before,
but whatever.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.764
Bet you've never seen a witch
pull a cat out of a rabbit, have you?

12:03.848 --> 12:09.061
With light and power, halt and bind
Freeze this witch in place, confined!

12:11.355 --> 12:13.315
-Whoa!
-Cool…

12:15.276 --> 12:18.571
That spell is
a great icebreaker at parties.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.030
Badaboom!

12:20.114 --> 12:23.367
With all my power and without delay
Teleport this witch away!

12:23.451 --> 12:24.493
-Oh dear.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.412
-Whoa!

12:26.495 --> 12:28.831
Girls, I hope you were paying attention.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.499
Did you get all that, girls?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.876
-Uh…

12:31.959 --> 12:32.918
Uh…

12:33.002 --> 12:33.878
Madame?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.172
Reverse the curse of the spell, disperse!

12:37.756 --> 12:38.632
Thank you.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.010
Alright, your turn. Go ahead.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.099
Now…

12:47.183 --> 12:49.477
I find people learn best under pressure.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.103
-No, wait!
-We're not ready yet!

12:51.187 --> 12:53.147
So you better think fast!

12:54.482 --> 12:55.441
Hide!

12:58.152 --> 12:59.487
You can't hide forever!

13:00.070 --> 13:03.407
Sooner or later,
your problems will find you.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.453
To repel a spell,
you must not fear when it comes near.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.253
With all my power and without delay
Teleport this witch away!

13:19.215 --> 13:22.551
You must be clear
and believe what you say.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.931
With light and power, halt and bind
Freeze that witch in place, confined!

13:29.767 --> 13:30.768
-Whoa!

13:30.851 --> 13:32.811
Now, that is impressive.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.941
I wield the light and turn this brute
From something spooky to something cute!

13:39.151 --> 13:40.277
Uh…

13:40.778 --> 13:43.614
Am I super adorable, or what?

13:43.697 --> 13:48.035
Yeah, well, yeah, if--
Okay, if lizards are super adorable,

13:48.118 --> 13:53.374
you are super, super,
super adorable.

13:53.457 --> 13:58.087
I'm a lizard?

13:58.170 --> 14:03.259
You must keep your eyes open
when casting a spell, Scout.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.262
Reverse the spell of the curse, disperse!

14:07.555 --> 14:10.307
That was
a very brave first try.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.063
So, clearly we bombed that lesson.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.439
What's next?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.608
-Flying!

14:23.362 --> 14:25.364
Oh, great!

14:26.240 --> 14:29.994
First witches, now the raccoons are back.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.913
So long, brisket.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.791
Or…

14:36.709 --> 14:40.963
do witches
disguise themselves as raccoons?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.423
-Huh?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.512
Oh, oh boy. Uh…

14:49.096 --> 14:53.559
No one gets between a man and his brisket!

14:57.062 --> 15:03.485
Confidence in yourself and in your magic
is the foundation of all witch skills,

15:03.569 --> 15:05.821
like flying a broom.

15:05.905 --> 15:11.285
If you want to believe in magic,
first, you have to believe in yourself!

15:12.578 --> 15:16.707
To begin, you'll fly with Pete around
the castle, and then come back to me.

15:16.790 --> 15:17.833
No problem.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.293
Seriously?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.921
Remember the last time
you had Willa's broom?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.339
This won't be that hard.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.176
Wherever you look, the broom
will take you, so don't look down!

15:28.719 --> 15:31.347
Off you go. Off you go!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.766
Tallyho, yahoo!

15:34.767 --> 15:37.353
-Catch me if you can, girls!
-Woah!

15:53.994 --> 15:56.205
-Oh…

15:56.288 --> 15:58.082
We're coming up on the curve!

15:58.165 --> 16:02.211
Feel the draft, lean into it!

16:02.294 --> 16:06.924
There's nothing like
the feeling of the wind in one's fur.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.314
Look up! Up!

16:25.401 --> 16:28.404
Soar, Willa! Soar like an eagle!

16:28.988 --> 16:31.615
You can do anything you believe, Willa!

16:32.116 --> 16:34.576
The sky's the limit!

16:43.460 --> 16:45.462
Does anyone have a weed whacker?

16:49.049 --> 16:51.135
You can't hide from me that easily!

17:07.860 --> 17:08.694
Willa…

17:10.154 --> 17:11.864
Are you in there?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.534
Adversity. It isn't failure.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.286
It's your teacher.

17:17.369 --> 17:21.373
But even if we could figure all this stuff
out, what are we supposed to do?

17:21.457 --> 17:25.210
Just take the witches head-on?
They have the amulet!

17:25.294 --> 17:28.756
They think they're invincible
because of the amulet?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.799
This is where the witches will fail.

17:30.883 --> 17:37.389
Their dark magic is based on hate,
and hate is always conquered by kindness.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.226
Kindness is our jam.
Bring on the next test.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.776
Aha! Found you!

17:49.359 --> 17:50.569
Uh, Madame?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.321
Are we expecting visitors?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.157
I'm here for the little witchlet.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.576
Very ingenious, Madame.

17:57.659 --> 17:58.827
Enough out of you.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.872
-Whoa!

18:01.955 --> 18:03.415
Uh, Winnifred?

18:03.499 --> 18:06.043
This has nothing to do
with me, girls. Run!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.504
Go ahead, run.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.175
On three…

18:14.968 --> 18:16.595
Okay.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.515
One, two…

18:27.189 --> 18:28.190
Whoa.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.401
This witchbusting business is serious.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.653
This way, run!

18:34.404 --> 18:35.489
Willa.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.324
Willa, I can hear you!

18:56.301 --> 18:57.636
Hello?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.980
Okay, hiding's not gonna work.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.024
I don't want to freak you out,
but I'm freaking out right now!

19:11.108 --> 19:13.986
-I've got you now!

19:14.069 --> 19:15.279
What do we do now?

19:15.362 --> 19:18.615
If we work together, we can do anything.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.870
-We'll freeze him.

19:24.204 --> 19:29.960
With light and power, halt and bind
Freeze that dog in place, confined!

19:34.173 --> 19:37.176
-Tremendous work, girls.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.846
Now what are we going to do with them?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.472
Melt him into a big puddle?

19:43.140 --> 19:46.768
Look, does he seem… sad?

19:46.852 --> 19:50.564
I don't think any dog would
work for Wanda and Wilma by choice.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.609
Those teeth were
two seconds away from this face!

19:53.692 --> 19:55.986
Maybe all he needs
is a little kindness.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.700
I don't think you're all that bad.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.828
Aw, who's a good, spooky, ghost boy?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.331
Is it you?
I think it's you!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.792
A good boy, mushy-mushy-moo.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.129
-Wow.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.799
Hi! I'm Snout!
Are you my new best friends?

20:17.883 --> 20:18.967
Hooray!

20:19.468 --> 20:21.762
-Whoa, what-- what happened?

20:21.845 --> 20:23.013
What did I miss?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.599
I could see in his heart
he was a good dog,

20:25.682 --> 20:27.768
and you could see it too.

20:28.352 --> 20:32.898
You have performed
with courage and compassion.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.817
You are true good witches.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.488
Yeah, you are way nicer
than those other witches!

20:40.072 --> 20:43.951
It's time for you to go home,
Willa, and win back that amulet.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.579
It belongs in the hands of good witches,
like you three.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.130
Wait.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.466
You… You're…

21:00.050 --> 21:04.805
When people who love you pass away,
their love keeps you with them always.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.223
Your mother knew that.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.933
You knew my mom?

21:08.684 --> 21:09.518
Willa.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.896
Willa!

21:14.231 --> 21:17.276
Thank goodness you're okay,
and you guys are okay,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.569
and Grandma Winnifred's okay, and…

21:22.155 --> 21:23.073
Grandma Winnifred?

21:23.156 --> 21:25.117
It's good to see you again, Neil.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.328
Winnifred, are you my grandma?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.330
Yes I am, Willa.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.458
I didn't tell you before
because I didn't want to distract you.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.628
Didn't you, um…

21:36.712 --> 21:37.963
pass on?

21:38.046 --> 21:42.718
I don't like that phrase, but yes.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.512
I wish I could take
this battle on for you, Willa,

21:45.595 --> 21:50.475
but in this ghostly form,
I'm somewhat limited.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.102
But after all this is over,

21:52.185 --> 21:54.688
I would love it if you would all
come back for some tea.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.732
I'd like that, too.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.112
Oh, good.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.157
The swirly thingy's back.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.080
Goodbye, Grandma.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.082
I love you.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.792
I love you too, dear.

22:16.376 --> 22:20.255
And remember, those of us
who are passed away are with you always,

22:20.339 --> 22:22.090
even if you can't see us.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.217
We are there.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.056
And now…

22:29.556 --> 22:33.226
Snout, we could use
some company around here.

22:33.810 --> 22:36.104
Seriously? New home?!

22:36.188 --> 22:40.484
This is the best day ever!
Thank you so much, Willa.

22:40.567 --> 22:44.321
Whoa!

22:45.322 --> 22:48.658
I still have a lot to learn, but…
there's no time.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.494
Don't worry, Dad.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.164
As long as we do it together,
we've got this.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.506
-Where is that dumb dog?

23:02.589 --> 23:05.300
I've called him
a million ways to midnight.

23:05.383 --> 23:09.137
He wouldn't even come for
a cricket snickety-snick-snack.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.140
Oh well, I guess
you can never trust a dead dog.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.017
Well, it doesn't matter!

23:14.101 --> 23:16.937
-Willa can't stop us now anyways!

23:17.020 --> 23:20.065
Because tomorrow is Halloween,

23:20.148 --> 23:24.194
and she's run out of time.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.826
-Oh yes, you have. Oh yes, you have.
