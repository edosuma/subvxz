Narrator: Tonight on
Ice Road Truckers...

00:03.971 --> 00:05.295
Come on, baby...

00:06.094 --> 00:08.910
Narrator: A battle of blood,
sweat and gears.

00:10.624 --> 00:12.028
This is heavy-hauling right here.

00:12.188 --> 00:13.802
Narrator: As the biggest loads...

00:16.597 --> 00:17.834
What the fuck!

00:18.008 --> 00:21.043
Narrator: ...and baddest drivers
collide on the ice.

00:23.101 --> 00:26.537
Narrator: - But only one...
- In the end, I'm gonna be on top.

00:26.539 --> 00:27.271
Narrator: Can be the best.

00:27.273 --> 00:27.905
[Truck horn honks]

00:27.907 --> 00:29.440
Can I go now?

00:29.442 --> 00:30.074
Look out.

00:30.076 --> 00:31.275
Easy, easy.

00:31.277 --> 00:35.179
Narrator: - And with tensions at the
breaking point... - Nothing today.

00:35.181 --> 00:37.615
Narrator: A veteran walks away.

00:37.617 --> 00:38.449
I've had it.

00:38.451 --> 00:40.718
I'm outta here, man.

Narrator: - In the Manitoba back country...
- I've gotta figure out a way

01:24.097 --> 01:26.263
to get that fucking
saddle tank fixed up.

01:26.265 --> 01:29.333
Narrator: Hugh Rowland and Rick
Yemm are only 50 miles from

01:29.335 --> 01:32.436
their delivery point
in Red Sucker Lake.

01:32.438 --> 01:35.172
That enough?

01:35.174 --> 01:38.342
Ah, you gotta go around the
other side there, Hugh.

01:38.344 --> 01:43.147
Narrator: But a loose fuel tank has
them racing to make roadside repairs.

01:43.149 --> 01:45.483
Come on, get in there.

01:45.485 --> 01:46.417
You get her in there, Rick?

01:46.419 --> 01:47.752
Got her in.

01:47.754 --> 01:53.257
Narrator: Yesterday, they
gambled on a high-paying

01:53.259 --> 01:55.793
load of 20-ton cement trucks.

01:55.795 --> 01:56.761
Heaviest load of the year.

01:56.763 --> 01:59.063
Hope we don't go through
the fucking ice.

01:59.065 --> 02:04.235
Narrator: But so far, their only
deposit is in the snowbank.

02:04.237 --> 02:05.603
All right.

02:05.605 --> 02:08.139
Whoa!

02:08.140 --> 02:11.509
Narrator: - And in the
light of day-- - Good?

02:11.511 --> 02:12.576
No, we gotta pull it.

02:12.578 --> 02:15.780
Narrator: A toe strap and elbow
grease are all they've got

02:15.782 --> 02:18.048
to rig the busted tank.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.784
Now this should hold her, man.

02:19.786 --> 02:21.152
Thanks for the help.

02:21.154 --> 02:23.421
[Laughs]

02:29.694 --> 02:31.896
It's all duct tape and
haywire up here, man.

02:31.898 --> 02:33.497
You do what you
gotta do to get by.

02:33.499 --> 02:36.033
There's no place to
fix your trucks.

02:36.035 --> 02:38.536
Do these runs, and get 'em done,
and then hopefully it'll

02:38.538 --> 02:42.106
hold together until we
get back to Winnipeg.

02:43.909 --> 02:47.845
[Siren blares]

02:47.847 --> 02:51.782
Two cement trucks.

02:51.784 --> 02:53.851
Go ahead.

02:53.853 --> 02:55.686
We need to check your weight.

02:55.688 --> 02:57.288
This is fucked up.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.390
[Siren blares]

02:59.392 --> 03:02.593
We don't know what's
gonna happen here.

03:02.595 --> 03:03.394
We could get fucked up.

03:03.396 --> 03:06.297
I hope not.

03:16.274 --> 03:21.412
It turns out that we might
not be going anywhere.

03:22.581 --> 03:27.117
Narrator: - 2,000 miles to the northwest...
- Fixing to walk in here to

03:27.119 --> 03:29.353
dispatch, and I want to come
up here for a challenge.

03:29.355 --> 03:30.888
I'm ready to go forward.

03:30.890 --> 03:31.989
Narrator: Ronald "Porkchop"

03:31.991 --> 03:36.460
Mangum is looking for another
chance to run the Dalton.

03:36.462 --> 03:37.995
I'm a truck driver.

03:37.997 --> 03:41.265
I don't give a damn whether it's cow
manure or whether it's nuclear waste.

03:41.267 --> 03:44.101
Whatever I need to take to
Prudhoe, I'll take it up there.

03:44.103 --> 03:46.237
Just have to see what happens.

03:46.239 --> 03:50.074
Narrator: So far this season...
[Crash]

03:50.076 --> 03:51.442
Son of a bitch.

03:51.444 --> 03:55.880
Narrator: His Alaskan experience
has hit an all-time low.

03:55.882 --> 04:02.453
I come up here to run the Dalton, and
I'm hauling dog food around town.

04:02.455 --> 04:03.387
What's up, Marky Mark?

04:03.389 --> 04:04.722
What's going on, Chop?

04:04.724 --> 04:08.626
Narrator: And getting back on the
Dalton is priority number one.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.461
What you got for me?

04:10.463 --> 04:12.730
We need you to get up
to Prudhoe for us.

04:12.732 --> 04:14.098
So I'm going back on the Dalton?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.833
Yup, back on the haul road.

04:15.835 --> 04:18.736
It's about time.

04:18.738 --> 04:21.605
Just like I told everybody when
I started this journey, you

04:21.607 --> 04:23.474
can't stop the Chop.

04:23.476 --> 04:24.441
Appreciate it, buddy.

04:24.443 --> 04:25.376
All right.

04:25.378 --> 04:26.477
Should be a good trip.

04:26.479 --> 04:29.480
You're gonna convoy
with Darrell.

04:29.482 --> 04:31.115
Seriously?

04:31.117 --> 04:32.550
That's the way it is.

04:32.552 --> 04:37.655
Narrator: And convoy partner Darrell
Ward is just about to get the news.

04:37.657 --> 04:40.991
I think you've got a load of, uh,
VSMs going out of here today.

04:40.993 --> 04:45.296
Uh, gonna run a little
convoy with, uh, Porkchop.

04:45.298 --> 04:47.298
Porkchop?

04:50.902 --> 04:52.770
I thought I was rolling solo.

04:52.772 --> 04:55.472
Well, I'm just gonna have you run
with, uh, Porkchop a little

04:55.474 --> 04:56.106
bit, have you lead the way.

04:56.108 --> 04:57.308
[Laughs]

04:57.310 --> 04:59.376
What do-- What do yo-- How-- How
do you-- How do you want me to

04:59.378 --> 05:00.311
handle Porkchop, you know?

05:00.313 --> 05:01.679
What do you want me to
do with the poor guy?

05:01.681 --> 05:03.414
You know, maybe it'll-- He'll
learn something different

05:03.416 --> 05:05.382
from you than he
would from Tony.

05:05.384 --> 05:09.019
I-I-you know, I respect what you
have for experience, okay, Darrell?

05:09.021 --> 05:11.655
You know, if we can get out
there and, uh, you know, help

05:11.657 --> 05:14.658
- the other guys now, that's--
That's a big plus, so-- - Sure.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.326
Okay?

05:15.328 --> 05:16.026
I'll give you a hand.

05:16.028 --> 05:17.962
I'll see what I
can do with him.

05:17.964 --> 05:18.662
Thanks, Darrell.

05:18.664 --> 05:19.296
I appreciate it, man.

05:19.298 --> 05:20.664
All right.
All right, you bet, Lane.

05:20.666 --> 05:21.298
Have a good trip.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.499
Yup, see you when I get back.

05:22.501 --> 05:24.868
Okay.

05:26.972 --> 05:28.472
Hey, Porkchop.

05:28.474 --> 05:29.873
I guess we're running a convoy.

05:29.875 --> 05:33.577
I'll take the lead, you
bring up the tail end.

05:33.579 --> 05:37.147
You know, I came up here the
same time Porkchop did.

05:37.149 --> 05:39.149
I don't think Porkchop's
got what it takes.

05:39.151 --> 05:40.718
I don't think he's
gonna last up here.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.723
You know, we're gonna be lucky if
he doesn't put one over the edge.

05:45.725 --> 05:47.191
Darrell talks big.

05:47.193 --> 05:50.894
He comes up here, blaze of glory,
he acts like he knows everything.

05:50.896 --> 05:52.997
In the South, we don't have
to let our words speak.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.365
We let our actions speak.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.433
In the end, I'm
gonna be on top.

05:56.435 --> 06:00.771
He'll be scratching his head, wondering
what the hell just happened.

06:00.773 --> 06:04.508
All right, wheels up.

06:04.510 --> 06:08.879
You know, Porkchop's gonna slow
me down, but that's what Carlile

06:08.881 --> 06:10.648
wants, that's what
I'll give 'em.

06:10.650 --> 06:12.583
[Horn blasts]

06:13.785 --> 06:18.455
Narrator: - Back at the Carlile office...
- Gonna go to dispatch.

06:18.457 --> 06:20.491
See what they got
to go north with.

06:20.493 --> 06:23.727
Narrator: Austin Wheeler is
looking for his second solo load

06:23.729 --> 06:25.129
of the season.

06:25.131 --> 06:28.932
Hopefully it's something more
challenging for me, like a--

06:28.934 --> 06:33.037
Like a wide load, or a heavy load,
or something cool like that.

06:34.539 --> 06:35.673
Hey, Mark, what's up?

06:35.675 --> 06:37.107
Nothing.
What's going on, Austin?

06:37.109 --> 06:39.677
Just seeing if you have a
load to go to Prudhoe with.

06:39.679 --> 06:41.211
I have this cabin.

06:41.213 --> 06:42.680
Like, live-in cabin?

06:42.682 --> 06:43.947
Like a live-in cabin.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.650
Like a guy's house, and
it's gotta be done tonight.

06:46.652 --> 06:50.921
The guy is living in the cabin, so-- Lane
just said, "hey, give this to Austin."

06:50.923 --> 06:51.922
Sweet.

06:51.924 --> 06:52.589
All right, thanks, Mark.

06:52.591 --> 06:55.125
All right, see ya.

06:55.127 --> 06:59.596
Narrator: The 22-foot long,
18-foot wide cabin is a prime

06:59.598 --> 07:02.666
assignment for any heavy hauler.

07:03.835 --> 07:06.970
We got a pretty big move that
Lane needs to get across town.

07:06.972 --> 07:09.306
That's the kind of
stuff I like to do.

07:09.308 --> 07:12.209
Finally they're realizing
what I'm made of.

07:12.211 --> 07:16.580
Narrator: And a major
test for the 23-year-old.

07:16.582 --> 07:20.818
Lane's given me this job because
he has confidence in me.

07:20.820 --> 07:24.655
I can't screw this up, so, uh,
I'll definitely be on my "A" game.

07:24.657 --> 07:27.725
Narrator: While Austin gears
up for the big move...

07:29.461 --> 07:31.729
Just pulling into Carlile.

07:31.731 --> 07:33.397
Lane better have something
good for me today.

07:33.399 --> 07:35.299
I kind of wanna get
out of here fast.

07:35.301 --> 07:40.204
Narrator: Jack Jessee's also
looking for a top-dollar load.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.206
So what do we got today, Mark?

07:42.208 --> 07:47.678
Um, we got this,
uh, water truck.

07:49.514 --> 07:50.147
What is this?

07:50.149 --> 07:51.682
Austin with a cabin?

07:51.684 --> 07:53.317
Why is he doing it?

07:53.319 --> 07:54.952
That's boss's orders.

07:54.954 --> 07:58.856
Lane told me to give
Austin the cabin.

07:58.858 --> 07:59.957
Just trying to move freight.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.326
You know how it goes.

08:02.328 --> 08:03.660
Don't be pissed at me, man.

08:03.662 --> 08:06.063
I'm just-- I'm just
the messenger.

08:06.065 --> 08:08.298
All right.

08:12.337 --> 08:13.704
Jack's a little bit pissed off.

08:13.706 --> 08:16.707
He's seen that Austin got an
oversize load, and he probably

08:16.709 --> 08:17.841
feels a little bit threatened.

08:17.843 --> 08:21.678
We're way too busy to be-- be,
uh, always catering to one

08:21.680 --> 08:22.613
driver or another.

08:22.615 --> 08:28.118
Narrator: Today's load is a
one-two punch to the veteran.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.953
I think he's trying to
do too much too fast.

08:29.955 --> 08:34.158
Narrator: Not only were his
concerns about Austin ignored...

08:34.159 --> 08:36.760
Maybe you better go out and
take your load, and I'll worry

08:36.761 --> 08:40.530
about getting
Austin up the road.

08:40.533 --> 08:44.868
Narrator: He was also passed
over for the heavy haul cabin.

08:44.870 --> 08:47.604
Right now, I'm not happy with
the way things are going.

08:47.606 --> 08:49.339
You take care of your veterans.

08:49.341 --> 08:52.376
You make sure they've got the
work that they want to do

08:52.378 --> 08:54.144
because those are the ones that
are gonna get you out of the

08:54.146 --> 08:56.513
pinch when you get into it.

08:56.515 --> 08:57.514
Let's get this
show on the road.

08:57.516 --> 09:01.351
I don't get paid to sit here,
regardless of what I'm hauling.

09:08.092 --> 09:10.794
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Oh!

09:10.796 --> 09:12.529
Narrator: Drivers
fight for control.

09:12.531 --> 09:14.698
[Indistinct radio chatter]

09:14.700 --> 09:16.800
Stop, stop!

09:19.349 --> 09:25.320
Narrator: - On the remote Dempster
highway... - Yeah, we're going.

09:25.322 --> 09:28.557
Narrator: Alex Debogorski
is racing south.

09:28.559 --> 09:32.461
I'm coming up on Klondike Corner,
mile zero of the Dempster highway.

09:32.463 --> 09:35.063
I'm hoping to
meet a truck here.

09:35.065 --> 09:37.799
Basically gonna switch with him,
give him an empty trailer, and

09:37.801 --> 09:39.968
take a loaded trailer
of groceries.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.471
Narrator: He's on a mission
to pick up another load of

09:42.473 --> 09:47.242
supplies for the remote
communities of northern Canada.

09:47.244 --> 09:51.179
The road's been closed for two
or three days now, and we're

09:51.181 --> 09:54.016
on our way to make use of
that little bit of open road.

09:54.018 --> 09:58.720
Narrator: - But for nearly a week...
- Oh, the gate's closed.

09:58.722 --> 10:02.224
Narrator: Alex's mission has
been put on hold by a violent

10:02.226 --> 10:04.726
storm that shut down the road.

10:04.728 --> 10:07.729
You've gotta be kidding me.

10:09.966 --> 10:15.771
Narrator: Now the road is open...
and Alex needs to take advantage

10:15.773 --> 10:19.374
of every second.

10:19.376 --> 10:22.310
It's been a tough season this
year that the roads are closed

10:22.312 --> 10:23.311
as much as they're open.

10:23.313 --> 10:26.581
They might even be closed more
than they're open, so that

10:26.583 --> 10:29.551
makes for a tough season.

10:31.354 --> 10:34.556
Narrator: Alex arrives
at the meeting point...

10:36.926 --> 10:39.661
but the load isn't there.

10:39.663 --> 10:43.031
I'm at Klondike Corners, and
the load I'm supposed to pick

10:43.033 --> 10:45.934
up isn't here yet.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.937
It's not good.

10:52.442 --> 10:55.744
Manitoulin with switch for
Klondike Corner, you copy?

10:55.746 --> 10:58.480
[Static]

10:58.482 --> 11:01.850
Manitoulin with switch for
Klondike Corner, you copy?

11:01.852 --> 11:03.485
[Static]

11:11.260 --> 11:14.496
Narrator: Every second Alex
waits for the load is time he

11:14.498 --> 11:16.965
should be running
up the Dempster.

11:19.103 --> 11:23.405

60 kilometers per hour with

11:23.407 --> 11:26.875
gusts up to 90
kilometers per hour.

11:26.877 --> 11:33.215
Heavy snowfall in the evening,
expected to accumulate up to 3 feet.

11:33.217 --> 11:39.321
I'm still waiting, and it
just really stresses me out.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.323
[Horn honking]

11:44.460 --> 11:48.597
Well, looks like
my friend is here.

11:48.599 --> 11:49.865
Good day, sir.

11:49.867 --> 11:50.699
Hello.

11:50.701 --> 11:55.470
Narrator: Three hours later, the
load of groceries arrives...

11:55.472 --> 11:57.439
The rush is on.

11:57.441 --> 12:03.445
Narrator: But with a storm on the
way, there's no time to lose.

12:06.983 --> 12:08.984
I'm makin' a quick
run up the Dempster.

12:08.986 --> 12:13.221
It's gonna be the
fastest one ever.

12:16.223 --> 12:18.527
The weather is nice here.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.595
I have no idea what the
weather's gonna be like a few

12:20.597 --> 12:22.531
hundred kilometers
down the road.

12:22.533 --> 12:28.270
In the north, weather can change
in the snap of the fingers.

12:30.373 --> 12:35.410
Narrator: - 300 miles to the west...
- I'm here to make the money,

12:35.412 --> 12:39.047
I'm here to get the loads, but
I just gotta take her easy,

12:39.049 --> 12:43.818
especially when you've got a rookie
behind you that doesn't know the road.

12:43.820 --> 12:47.422
Narrator: Darrell Ward is
convoying with Porkchop.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.356
Don't really like it.

12:48.358 --> 12:51.359
Darrell's a hot rod, and he's
already got one citation.

12:51.361 --> 12:57.899
Narrator: And only 30 miles out of
town, they're not making good time.

12:57.901 --> 13:01.903
When we get up here, I'm gonna
pull over for just a second.

13:07.310 --> 13:10.812
Narrator: On his return to the haul
road, Porkchop's playing it safe.

13:10.814 --> 13:13.515
[Brakes squealing]

13:13.517 --> 13:15.884
This is my shot
to redeem myself.

13:15.886 --> 13:17.919
I'm not gonna make
bad decisions.

13:17.921 --> 13:20.722
I'm out here to be
safe and do my job.

13:20.724 --> 13:25.393
Narrator: - And Darrell...
- Fucking amazing.

13:25.395 --> 13:27.896
Narrator: Is forced to wait.

13:27.898 --> 13:30.932
Well, I'll sit here and wait for
him like I told him I would,

13:30.934 --> 13:32.901
waste more time.

13:32.903 --> 13:36.738

[Grunts]

13:43.412 --> 13:45.847
[Grunts]

13:45.849 --> 13:49.918
You want it in a "G"
note all the time.

13:55.891 --> 13:57.826
Can I go now?

14:00.930 --> 14:04.432
Narrator: While the newcomers
sit on the side of the road...

14:04.434 --> 14:07.168
Oh, oh, we got a Porkchop here.

14:07.170 --> 14:11.172
I don't know what they're doing,
but I'm gonna get ahead of 'em.

14:16.979 --> 14:20.749
As far as the other guys, I
think they're all kind of

14:20.751 --> 14:23.451
gunning for my position,
my experience.

14:23.453 --> 14:27.088
I think Darrell's the only one
that's got a chance to achieve it.

14:27.090 --> 14:30.191
It just hasn't clicked
for Porkchop yet.

14:30.193 --> 14:33.395
It will click for him
eventually, I think, but he's

14:33.397 --> 14:35.997
not a haul road driver.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.000
Narrator: Finally.

14:39.002 --> 14:41.836
Let's truck it up.

14:41.838 --> 14:45.106
Narrator: Porkchop's
ready to roll out.

14:45.108 --> 14:47.642
All right, Porkchop,
ready to roll?

14:47.644 --> 14:49.644
All right.

14:50.946 --> 14:52.547
I don't know what
goes on back there.

14:52.549 --> 14:54.182
I'm always stopping
and waiting on him.

14:54.184 --> 14:58.119
I'm after the load count, and
this ain't working for me.

14:58.121 --> 15:01.556
Fucking pisses me off.

15:01.558 --> 15:05.627
I mean, there's a deadline on the time
that you have to make this round.

15:05.629 --> 15:07.595
You know?

15:07.597 --> 15:09.964
At this rate, it
ain't gonna happen.

15:09.966 --> 15:11.599
This is my shot to come back.

15:11.601 --> 15:15.136
Just gotta take it easy
and do what we gotta do.

15:15.138 --> 15:19.574
You can't soar like an eagle when
you run around with turkeys.

15:23.245 --> 15:28.983
Narrator: - 2,000 miles to the southeast...
This fucking bites shit, man.

15:28.985 --> 15:32.087
Narrator: Hugh and Rick just
found out their 20-ton cement

15:32.089 --> 15:34.489
trucks are too heavy
for the road.

15:34.491 --> 15:36.124
It was the wrong
road to begin with.

15:36.126 --> 15:39.561
I think someone just didn't
calculate the weight and the--

15:39.563 --> 15:41.529
and the journey.

15:43.332 --> 15:45.967
It's gonna be tricky, getting these
cement trucks into Red Sucker Lake.

15:45.969 --> 15:49.437
Not sure what some of the weight
restrictions are quite yet.

15:51.474 --> 15:52.507
Mark dropped the ball.

15:52.509 --> 15:53.875
He didn't really
think about it.

15:53.877 --> 15:55.610
That's Mark's job.

15:55.612 --> 16:00.715
Narrator: Now a miscalculation has
put an end to the lucrative haul.

16:00.717 --> 16:03.752
'Cause chief and council, you
know, they want you guys

16:03.754 --> 16:05.453
here, they just don't want
any problems, that's all.

16:05.455 --> 16:07.889
Do whatever we gotta do,
that's what I say. [Laughs]

16:07.891 --> 16:09.090
Yup.

16:09.092 --> 16:11.359
Let's go.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.796
Narrator: And with the cement
trucks over the legal limit...

16:14.798 --> 16:16.731
[Truck horn blaring]

16:18.567 --> 16:24.272
They're forced to abandon the
loads and head back to Winnipeg.

16:25.574 --> 16:26.808
Good.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.276
That'll work.

16:28.278 --> 16:32.414
Unfortunately, chief and
council, I have to walk ya.

16:32.416 --> 16:39.254
Narrator: Adding insult to injury...
Hugh and Rick are escorted out of town.

16:39.256 --> 16:40.255
We're getting a fucking

16:40.257 --> 16:43.825
police escort out of town here
because, uh, we hauled them

16:43.827 --> 16:46.261
loads up, and they were too
heavy in the first place.

16:46.263 --> 16:50.198
This'll make sure that we're
actually leaving them loads there.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.600
So we gotta start watching our
"P"s and "Q"s here, or we're

16:52.602 --> 16:53.435
gonna--
[Laughs]

16:53.437 --> 16:55.437
We're gonna end up in jail.

16:57.773 --> 17:01.176
Narrator: 20 miles later,
they reach the edge of town.

17:01.178 --> 17:03.711
[Truck horn honking]

17:03.713 --> 17:06.181
There's two more loads sitting
where they're not supposed to be.

17:06.183 --> 17:11.486
Narrator: - This trip has been a
complete loss... - Adios, fuckers.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.022
Narrator: And the ticked
off truckers hammer down.

17:18.394 --> 17:22.664
It just kinda seems fitting with the
year, it's been a fucking fight.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.066
Manitoba ice road trucking.

17:31.841 --> 17:33.708
Ouch.

17:36.412 --> 17:39.547
Oh, yeah.

17:39.549 --> 17:41.716
Fuck!

17:44.687 --> 17:46.921
Ah!

17:52.328 --> 17:55.363
Aw, you kidding me!

18:00.736 --> 18:04.105
Mr. Rowland?
You got a copy?

18:07.776 --> 18:09.744
Ah, you got a copy?

18:12.648 --> 18:15.383
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Come on, baby.

18:15.385 --> 18:19.120
Narrator: The Dempster
cuts down a legend.

18:23.031 --> 18:27.735
Narrator: - On a remote stretch of
Manitoba's winter roads... - Mr. Rowland?

18:27.737 --> 18:28.903
You got a copy?

18:28.905 --> 18:29.737
[Static]

18:29.739 --> 18:33.007
Narrator: Rick Yemm is
stuck in a snowbank.

18:33.009 --> 18:36.143
Ah, you got a copy?

18:36.145 --> 18:41.649
Hugh's out of reach, and
help could be days away.

18:43.251 --> 18:45.186
Oh, God.

18:47.322 --> 18:49.290
Oh.

18:54.296 --> 18:57.364
Narrator: Rick's only hope is a
passing motorist who is kind

18:57.366 --> 18:59.433
enough to lend a hand.

18:59.435 --> 19:01.435
Get me outta here.

19:02.838 --> 19:06.373
We didn't have enough room right here,
so I fucking took the snowbank.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.476
I couldn't stop.

19:16.218 --> 19:18.085
Whenever you're ready there.

19:22.491 --> 19:29.263
Narrator: With a boost from the pickup...
Rick's back on the road.

19:29.265 --> 19:29.930
[Laughs]

19:29.932 --> 19:30.764
Now I did it all.

19:30.766 --> 19:32.366
[Both laugh]

19:32.368 --> 19:35.836
[Laughs]

19:35.838 --> 19:37.838
Let's go.

19:41.576 --> 19:43.844
Just with everything being
chaotic with the loads that

19:43.846 --> 19:47.181
we've dealt with so far, let's
just say, she's been eventful

19:47.183 --> 19:51.552
for fucking ice road
trucking season this year.

19:52.754 --> 20:00.427
Narrator: - 1,600 miles to the northwest...
- Well, it's snowing.

20:00.429 --> 20:02.263
The road's all white.

20:02.265 --> 20:04.798
Can't see the
shoulders, hardly.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.135
Narrator: Alex is 200 miles up
the Dempster with a load of

20:08.137 --> 20:12.006
- groceries for Inuvik...
- Building ice on the wipers.

20:12.008 --> 20:15.042
Narrator: And he's racing north
before the gathering storm

20:15.044 --> 20:16.911
shuts down the road.

20:16.913 --> 20:21.715
Snow dust all over the
place, blinding snow dust.

20:21.717 --> 20:24.521
Shoulders are hard to see because
it's very gray, so it's

20:24.654 --> 20:27.621
kind of a whiteout.

20:30.692 --> 20:32.459
Ooh.

20:32.461 --> 20:35.396
Stay on the road.

20:35.398 --> 20:38.365
I feel that shoulder pulling
me there a little bit.

20:38.367 --> 20:44.305
Narrator: - But as conditions get worse...
- Yes, sir, I want to put chains on.

20:44.307 --> 20:51.545
Narrator: The veteran throws on
iron to battle the building snow.

20:53.648 --> 20:55.583
Okay.

21:15.604 --> 21:20.507
Narrator: But the deep drifts are
giving him a run for his money.

21:20.509 --> 21:23.310
Sure didn't slip into
gear very nice there.

21:23.312 --> 21:29.049
Narrator: And one of the Dempster's
toughest climbs is just up ahead.

21:29.051 --> 21:29.783
[Grinding]

21:29.785 --> 21:31.652
Ah.

21:36.791 --> 21:42.062
Narrator: Weighed down with 17
tons of groceries, Alex is

21:42.064 --> 21:46.967
struggling to get traction,
even with a set of chains.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.404
[Squealing metal]

21:53.141 --> 21:53.774
[Squealing metal]

21:53.776 --> 21:59.113
That's it, can't do it.

21:59.115 --> 22:02.583
What's going on right
now, I spun out.

22:02.585 --> 22:05.519
For whatever reason, I can't
climb up this hill, so I expect

22:05.521 --> 22:08.822
I'm a little too heavy in the
back end, which means we need

22:08.824 --> 22:13.894
another set of chains on
here, which is not nice.

22:13.896 --> 22:18.332
Narrator: Adding another set
is the veteran's only move.

22:19.601 --> 22:22.603
See if we can make this
pain in the ass work.

22:22.605 --> 22:24.305
[Grunting] Okay.

22:35.784 --> 22:38.252
[Groans]

22:38.254 --> 22:40.254
[Sighs]

22:41.623 --> 22:43.590
Okay.

22:55.236 --> 22:59.740
Narrator: Chained to the max,
the grizzled veteran gives

22:59.742 --> 23:01.709
it everything he's got.

23:08.350 --> 23:10.184
Oh, lord, give me a hand.

23:10.186 --> 23:12.419
Give me a little push.

23:12.421 --> 23:14.922
In Jesus' name, amen.

23:30.105 --> 23:32.272
Okay, baby.

23:32.274 --> 23:34.908
You got no choice now.

23:34.910 --> 23:39.012
I'll have this road so chewed up,
nobody'll be able to use it.

23:52.794 --> 23:54.728
Come on, baby.

24:01.202 --> 24:02.736
Hoo.

24:02.738 --> 24:04.905
Chewed all the way up.

24:07.475 --> 24:08.575
[Radio static]

24:08.577 --> 24:09.643
[Sighs]

24:09.645 --> 24:12.746
Well, thank you, lord.

24:12.748 --> 24:15.082
Narrator: Alex is underway.

24:15.084 --> 24:18.218
Finally, I made my way up.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.486
What a rush, man.

24:19.488 --> 24:21.922
[Laughs]

24:21.924 --> 24:27.861
Narrator: But the storm is growing,
and Inuvik is still 200 miles away.

24:27.863 --> 24:28.762
Jeez.

24:28.764 --> 24:30.764
Well, we're not done yet.

24:43.378 --> 24:48.449
Narrator: - 450 miles to the west...
- We're 22-feet wide, man.

24:48.451 --> 24:52.653
Narrator: Austin Wheeler preps for his
biggest assignment of the season.

24:52.655 --> 24:55.255
Lane sent me out here to do
this 'cause, uh, this is the

24:55.257 --> 24:57.958
widest load of the
season, for sure.

24:57.960 --> 25:02.329
Narrator: But the newbie's first
challenge is just getting it loaded.

25:02.331 --> 25:04.965
We're gonna lift the cabin
with this front-end loader.

25:04.967 --> 25:07.968
This front-end loader
lifts 20,000 pounds.

25:07.970 --> 25:10.671
So we just want to go 3 inches
at a time and just slowly work

25:10.673 --> 25:12.573
our way up like a ladder.

25:12.575 --> 25:15.509
Narrator: A mistake here could
end Austin's heavy haul

25:15.511 --> 25:17.744
mission before it starts.

25:17.746 --> 25:19.379
We got to make sure it's balanced.

25:19.381 --> 25:22.182
'Cause of the weight of the front
awning here, it could tip

25:22.184 --> 25:23.851
right off there if
it's too heavy.

25:23.853 --> 25:25.486
Everybody clear?

25:25.488 --> 25:28.722
[Creaking]

25:30.158 --> 25:31.024
There we go.

25:31.026 --> 25:32.493
3 inches.

[Creaking]

25:37.466 --> 25:39.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:39.568 --> 25:40.234
Hold up.

25:40.236 --> 25:42.669
[Creaking]

25:42.671 --> 25:44.771
Okay.

25:44.773 --> 25:49.376
That extra weight on that prow
just shifted forward a little bit.

25:49.378 --> 25:52.045
Narrator: The cabin is
teetering on the forklifts.

25:52.047 --> 25:55.415
You're good by 1/8 of an inch.

25:55.417 --> 25:56.850
No doubt.

25:56.852 --> 26:00.120
Narrator: And the rookie's
margin for error... [Truck horn honking]

26:00.122 --> 26:02.122
Is razor thin.

26:02.124 --> 26:04.424
Okay, let's take it
up a little bit.

26:04.426 --> 26:06.860
Just watch this here.

26:06.862 --> 26:07.761
Hang on.

26:07.763 --> 26:09.763
Straight up.

26:11.266 --> 26:12.766
Cut-- cut it.

26:12.768 --> 26:18.238

26:18.240 --> 26:20.307
That's good.

26:23.077 --> 26:24.411
Watch that.

26:30.852 --> 26:33.320
Got two on the front,
two on the back.

26:33.322 --> 26:34.955
It's good for 20,000.

26:34.957 --> 26:38.792
Well, we finally got this cabin
loaded up safely, and it's tied down.

26:38.794 --> 26:42.329
I definitely want to deliver
it in the way we picked it up.

26:42.331 --> 26:48.402
Narrator: But for the 23-year-old,
the hard part is just beginning.

26:48.404 --> 26:53.674
He'll have to navigate the
city's narrow streets, avoiding

26:53.676 --> 26:57.044
vehicles and low-hanging signs.

26:59.013 --> 27:02.416
This is gonna be a
cool night move.

27:02.418 --> 27:06.887
Narrator: While the new heavy
hauler gets underway...

27:06.889 --> 27:09.089
450 miles to the north...

27:10.425 --> 27:14.795
It's not really anger, it's
just-- It's frustration, man.

27:14.797 --> 27:18.198
Narrator: Haul road ace Jack
Jessee's still stewing over

27:18.200 --> 27:20.500
Austin's choice assignment.

27:20.502 --> 27:24.137
I show up and get a water truck,
and Austin has a cabin?

27:24.139 --> 27:28.141
You know, and he just
doesn't have a clue.

27:28.143 --> 27:31.244
More experience and
the exact load.

27:37.885 --> 27:40.954
Narrator: But the veteran can't
afford to be distracted...

27:40.956 --> 27:43.056
Look how slick that is.

27:43.058 --> 27:45.359
Traction's gonna be an issue.

27:45.361 --> 27:50.097
Narrator: As he hits a slick stretch
of road near Franklin Bluff.

27:51.165 --> 27:53.100
Whoa, whoa.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.638
This road is slick.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.907
It's throwing that water truck
around, and it's actually

28:00.909 --> 28:02.643
jerkin' me forward and back.

28:02.645 --> 28:06.313
I'm sliding all over the road
here, I gotta be extra careful,

28:06.315 --> 28:08.448
take my time through here.

28:10.985 --> 28:14.655
This is the kind of spot you
don't want to be in a truck.

28:18.092 --> 28:19.760
This road is--
[Truck horn blaring]

28:19.762 --> 28:21.261
Man, it's getting close.

28:21.263 --> 28:23.363
Easy, easy, easy!

28:23.365 --> 28:25.999
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

28:26.001 --> 28:28.168
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Howdy.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.837
Narrator: Rookies reach
the breaking point.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.673
I was just trying to
play by the rules.

28:32.675 --> 28:35.008
Not when you're after
the load count.

28:36.722 --> 28:40.959
Narrator: - 40 miles South of Prudhoe Bay...
- This is the kind of spot you

28:40.961 --> 28:42.627
don't want to be in a truck.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.897
Narrator: Jack Jessee's battling
a slick section of road

28:45.899 --> 28:48.133
with oncoming traffic.

28:48.135 --> 28:49.067
Man, it's getting close.

28:49.069 --> 28:49.968
[Truck horn blaring]

28:49.970 --> 28:52.270
Easy, easy!

28:52.272 --> 28:54.706
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

28:59.545 --> 29:01.980
God.

29:08.888 --> 29:11.456
That got intense.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.825
That was fucking real.

29:13.827 --> 29:14.826
Wow.

29:14.828 --> 29:17.896
Trailer just locked up and
almost slid off the road.

29:28.341 --> 29:29.975
Wow.

29:38.351 --> 29:41.353
I could've brought the truck
to a complete stop, and that

29:41.355 --> 29:44.255
trailer could've just kept going,
and then it would've drug

29:44.257 --> 29:48.760
me down and flopped everything
over, so that ain't good.

29:59.638 --> 30:03.541
Narrator: By the time Jack
reaches Prudhoe Bay...

30:03.543 --> 30:07.645
I don't know if I could've-- If
I could've handled much more.

30:07.647 --> 30:11.416
Narrator: The close call
still has him shaken.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.718
If you don't take things serious
around here, that's when

30:13.720 --> 30:16.054
you're gonna die.

30:16.056 --> 30:19.424
This stuff damn near
killed me tonight.

30:27.433 --> 30:34.072
Narrator: - 270 miles to the South...
- That damn chicken strip, or

30:34.074 --> 30:36.107
whatever they're
calling him now.

30:36.109 --> 30:41.146
Narrator: Darrell and Porkchop are
12 hours into a bitter convoy.

30:41.148 --> 30:42.514
Porkchop.

30:42.516 --> 30:45.450
My God, how could you go through
life with everybody calling you

30:45.452 --> 30:46.785
P-- "Hey, Porkchop!"

30:46.787 --> 30:48.219
Fucking asshole.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.556
Narrator: And Porkchop's slow
and careful pace has them less

30:51.558 --> 30:54.526
than halfway up the road.

30:54.528 --> 30:56.494
"Yeah, I'm Porkchop.

30:56.496 --> 31:02.300
Nothin' stops the Chop, except
for Atigun Pass, Beaver Slide,

31:02.302 --> 31:07.038
any slick road, that's the only
thing that stops the Chop."

31:07.040 --> 31:11.609
Narrator: - Far behind...
- Seriously, he leave me?

31:11.611 --> 31:13.611
What the hell?

31:13.613 --> 31:18.783
Narrator: Porkchop's struggling to
keep pace with the Montana log hauler.

31:18.785 --> 31:21.019
Darrell wants to blaze a trail
and go on up ahead and be

31:21.021 --> 31:22.253
a hot rod, that's his business.

31:22.255 --> 31:26.357
I'm not gonna go off in a ditch just
to try to keep up with somebody.

31:26.359 --> 31:30.428
He's supposed to be, you know,
taking the lead on this.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.430
You see who I can count on.

31:38.304 --> 31:42.640
Man screws me up on my load count,
trying to run with the-- the convoy.

31:42.642 --> 31:47.345
Narrator: A convoy only moves as
fast as the slowest driver...

31:47.347 --> 31:50.715
I guess I'm gonna go ahead and
wait for him up here at Coldfoot.

31:50.717 --> 31:53.751
Narrator: And getting too far
ahead means Darrell's forced to

31:53.753 --> 31:55.620
let Porkchop catch up.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.623
He's long ways behind me.

32:07.933 --> 32:13.638
Narrator: Two hours later...
Porkchop pulls in.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.808
I'm going to see
what the story is.

32:16.810 --> 32:20.812
Narrator: And Darrell
is looking for answers.

32:25.618 --> 32:28.419
Huh, what took you so long?

32:28.421 --> 32:30.355
Hey, I thought we was
going as a convoy.

32:30.357 --> 32:31.956
I was just trying to
play by the rules.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.459
Yeah, all I was doing was
looking at the hours that we

32:34.461 --> 32:36.628
have to make it from
point "A" to point "B."

32:36.630 --> 32:38.630
You can always sit down
wherever you're at.

32:38.632 --> 32:41.432
Not when you're after
the load count.

32:41.434 --> 32:43.134
I'm out here to make money.

32:43.136 --> 32:46.271
I have to make
my loads on time.

32:46.273 --> 32:48.873
I ain't out here to win a race,
I'm out here for my kids man.

32:48.875 --> 32:50.542
This is about being here
and making a few dollars.

32:50.544 --> 32:53.778
The only way I make any money is
to get my loads delivered, get

32:53.780 --> 32:55.280
another one, get back.

32:55.282 --> 33:02.554
Dragging our feet ain't working,
so you know, that's the way it is.

33:02.556 --> 33:06.124
Narrator: Only halfway up the
road, the day's driving hours

33:06.126 --> 33:10.628
are used up, so Prudhoe
Bay will have to wait.

33:10.630 --> 33:12.263
I've got a schedule to keep.

33:12.265 --> 33:15.200
Now I'm stuck here in
Coldfoot for the night.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.603
I've had it.

33:18.605 --> 33:20.004
He's cocky, and he's arrogant.

33:20.006 --> 33:22.440
He's got to take it back a couple
notches and understand he

33:22.442 --> 33:23.474
needs to slow down.

33:23.476 --> 33:24.542
I run my speed.

33:24.544 --> 33:28.913
I would say I'm playing
it by the book.

33:33.219 --> 33:37.922
Narrator: - 250 miles to the South...
- This is heavy hauling right here.

33:37.924 --> 33:40.758
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's
being put to the test after

33:40.760 --> 33:47.198
Carlile bosses picked the 23-year-old
to take on an oversize cabin.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.933
You know, we're 22-feet wide.

33:48.935 --> 33:53.538
Even things on the side of the
road you gotta watch out for.

33:53.540 --> 33:55.440
On a road like this, there's
a lot of private drivers...

33:55.442 --> 33:56.074
[Car horn blaring]

33:56.076 --> 33:57.742
A lot of people
trying to go home.

33:57.744 --> 34:01.279
You got on-ramps where
you can't see traffic.

34:01.281 --> 34:05.116
We take up the whole road,
and I mean the whole road.

34:05.118 --> 34:08.418
Narrator: The oversize load
turns the city streets into a

34:08.420 --> 34:12.389
hazard-filled obstacle course...
[Car horn honking]

34:12.391 --> 34:16.960
Where Austin has nothing to rely
on but his skill and the eyes

34:16.963 --> 34:19.931
of his pilot car drivers.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.268
Can we weave through
these lights?

34:23.270 --> 34:26.504
I would straddle
the peak on that.

34:26.505 --> 34:29.107
We gotta be careful when we're
going under these streetlights.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.043
They hang low, so we want to try
to catch 'em in the middle.

34:32.045 --> 34:33.411
[Radio static]

34:33.413 --> 34:35.413
Okay.

34:49.795 --> 34:53.697
As far left as you can possibly get
without catching that sign, I guess.

34:53.699 --> 34:57.235
I'm gonna go under it real slow.

35:07.546 --> 35:08.579
[Car horn honking]

35:11.750 --> 35:13.151
You're pretty close
to that sign.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.752
Steady-- stop, stop, oh!

35:14.754 --> 35:17.322
[Crashing]

35:17.324 --> 35:20.224
Narrator: - Coming up...
- I am looking for a load.

35:20.226 --> 35:22.160
Narrator: The end of the line.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.162
There'll be something
here for you tomorrow.

35:24.164 --> 35:27.231
Don't bother, and you
can tell that to Lane.

35:29.931 --> 35:34.234
Narrator: - Just outside of Fairbanks,
Alaska... - As far left as you can

35:34.236 --> 35:37.204
possibly get without
catching that sign, I guess.

35:37.206 --> 35:40.507
Narrator: The biggest challenge
of Austin's season...

35:40.509 --> 35:42.276
You're pretty close
to that sign.

35:42.278 --> 35:44.478
Narrator: Hits a
bump in the road.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.347
Steady-- stop, stop, oh!

35:46.349 --> 35:47.181
[Crashing]

35:47.183 --> 35:50.551
Yeah, you hit the
street sign there.

35:54.022 --> 35:56.023
Oh, man, didn't even see it.

35:56.025 --> 35:58.392
Yeah, you lost a
little plastic gutter.

35:58.394 --> 36:00.394
Oh, boy.

36:00.396 --> 36:02.663
Definitely a tricky haul.

36:02.665 --> 36:08.769
Narrator: With the cabin already damaged,
there's no more room for error.

36:08.771 --> 36:14.608
We're about to go under an overpass,
and it's real close to the ground.

36:14.610 --> 36:18.112
Narrator: And a mistake here
could destroy the cabin, shut

36:18.114 --> 36:22.449
down the road, and end
Austin's heavy-haul dreams.

36:22.451 --> 36:24.284
This is gonna be rough.

36:24.286 --> 36:27.554
I'm just gonna drive
under it real slow.

36:34.696 --> 36:37.898
Holy fuck, that's really close.

36:47.675 --> 36:50.544
Yeah, that one was
definitely close.

36:50.546 --> 36:57.751
Narrator: Clear of the overpass,
Austin's made it to the delivery site.

36:57.753 --> 36:59.653
Well, we're right here
to our destination.

36:59.655 --> 37:02.022
Uh, I'm gonna go in
here and look at it.

37:02.024 --> 37:05.059
Narrator: And Carlile boss
Lane Keator and the cabin's

37:05.061 --> 37:09.563
owner are on hand to see
if Austin passed the test.

37:12.667 --> 37:13.700
Good?

37:13.702 --> 37:15.803
[Brakes squealing]

37:15.805 --> 37:18.338
Think that's about it.

37:21.076 --> 37:22.943
Uh, let me-- Let's go up
here and look at this.

37:22.945 --> 37:26.480
This is--this is the only
part I was worried about.

37:26.482 --> 37:27.848
Look up there.

37:27.850 --> 37:28.549
Oh, yeah.

37:28.551 --> 37:29.216
Just separated it.

37:29.218 --> 37:32.386
Yup, that's all it-- That's all it
did right there, so that's good.

37:32.388 --> 37:35.322
Just separated just a little
bit, and the sign didn't even

37:35.324 --> 37:38.559
break, so I was totally
stoked about that. [Laughs]

37:38.561 --> 37:42.729
Narrator: The damage is nothing more
than a disconnected drain pipe.

37:42.731 --> 37:46.133
Here's the keys to your house, safely
in the hole where you wanted it.

37:46.135 --> 37:47.935
I appreciate you bringing it
all the way to the North Pole.

37:47.937 --> 37:48.635
No problem.

37:48.637 --> 37:51.371
I'm glad you're happy with it.

37:51.373 --> 37:56.210
Narrator: And Austin's earned another
notch in his heavy-haul belt.

37:56.212 --> 37:59.580
It's just a little test, and,
uh, Austin did a good job.

37:59.582 --> 38:04.017
It's gonna bode well for him
in the future here at Carlile.

38:08.990 --> 38:16.196
Narrator: - 280 miles to the north...
- It only takes about a couple minutes.

38:16.198 --> 38:22.803
Narrator: After a night in Coldfoot...
Darrell and Porkchop are back on

38:22.805 --> 38:28.041
the road, chaining up before
climbing Atigun Pass.

38:28.043 --> 38:29.042
I'm outta here, man.

38:29.044 --> 38:30.744
Rock and roll.

38:30.746 --> 38:36.283
Narrator: But while the Montana
log hauler is ready to go...

38:36.285 --> 38:38.051
[Sighing] I threw that
set the wrong way.

38:38.053 --> 38:39.486
Son of a bitch.

38:39.488 --> 38:42.856
Narrator: Porkchop's still
going at his own pace.

38:42.858 --> 38:44.158
Freezing here.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.659
I'm from the South.

38:45.661 --> 38:48.862
This is the second set
I've ever had to sling.

38:48.864 --> 38:51.865
Well, I guess I'm gonna let
Porkchop catch up with me over

38:51.867 --> 38:55.602
on the chain-removal area.

38:55.604 --> 38:58.438
Oh, I don't think Porkchop's
thrown chains that much.

38:58.440 --> 39:02.409
The only way you're gonna learn
is jump in and do it yourself.

39:07.949 --> 39:09.883
There we go.

39:15.256 --> 39:18.625
I had to sling some
iron on the truck.

39:18.627 --> 39:23.263
Let's hope for the best, but
we'll expect the worst.

39:24.365 --> 39:27.701
Narrator: As Porkchop's
just getting started...

39:29.237 --> 39:30.904
Aggravating.

39:30.906 --> 39:35.075
Narrator: Darrell's already
made it over the pass.

39:35.077 --> 39:38.312
There's 30 minutes
out of the day gone.

39:42.951 --> 39:43.684
[Whistles]

39:43.686 --> 39:45.686
I need to get on up the road.

39:53.294 --> 39:55.262
Oh, here comes Porkchop.

40:01.903 --> 40:04.338
Just delays me.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.173
[Grunts]

40:06.175 --> 40:07.341
We made it to the bottom, baby.

40:07.343 --> 40:09.343
That's all that matters.

40:13.481 --> 40:15.515
Ready to roll?

40:15.517 --> 40:17.351
10-4, roll on, brother.

40:19.454 --> 40:20.821
I'm going slow and steady.

40:20.823 --> 40:24.791
Just like the tortoise and the hare,
slow and steady wins the race, baby.

40:28.062 --> 40:30.364
I'm kinda supposed to take him
under my wing a little bit

40:30.366 --> 40:34.568
and help him out, but I get
annoyed with fucking stupidity.

40:34.570 --> 40:35.535
This really sucks.

40:35.537 --> 40:38.805
I gotta run by myself if
I'm gonna make any money.

40:40.908 --> 40:47.481
Narrator: Darrell and Porkchop are
still 200 miles from Prudhoe Bay.

40:47.483 --> 40:50.284
But over on the Dempster...

40:51.452 --> 40:54.488
We made it in one piece, and it
looks like we've made it on time.

40:54.490 --> 40:59.393
Narrator: Alex is pulling into Inuvik
after driving through the night.

40:59.395 --> 41:05.098
I got a load in Dawson City,
rushed it up here to Inuvik.

41:05.100 --> 41:08.135
You know, I ran-- I ran it pretty
hard this trip, and I guess I'm

41:08.137 --> 41:10.003
gonna go and wash my laundry.

41:10.005 --> 41:12.506
[Laughs]

41:12.508 --> 41:19.880
Narrator: Back on track...
Alex racks up another load, and

41:19.882 --> 41:26.653
with Darrell stuck in a convoy, the
haul road ace pulls into the lead.

41:33.528 --> 41:36.897
- In Fairbanks... - I've done my
share this year for the company.

41:36.899 --> 41:39.866
You know, they've asked a lot,
and I haven't complained, and

41:39.868 --> 41:42.202
I've given them
everything they wanted.

41:42.204 --> 41:44.438
Now it's my turn.

41:44.440 --> 41:48.275
Narrator: Jack Jessee's back
for another run up the Dalton.

41:51.946 --> 41:54.281
- Morning, Mark.
- What's going on, Jack?

41:54.283 --> 41:56.016
I am looking for a load.

41:56.018 --> 41:58.151
Everything that I got
dispatched is already getting

41:58.153 --> 42:00.654
ready to go, and I
don't have any.

42:00.656 --> 42:01.488
You got nothing?

42:01.490 --> 42:03.090
Nothing today.

42:03.092 --> 42:06.927
Austin's working, isn't he?

42:06.929 --> 42:09.463
Yeah, I've already dispatched out
what I've-- What I had earlier.

42:09.465 --> 42:11.365
So what, I just sit
in town all day?

42:11.367 --> 42:12.265
Don't make any money?

42:12.267 --> 42:15.736
I can't do anything about
not having freight.

42:18.306 --> 42:20.474
There'll be something
here for you tomorrow.

42:20.476 --> 42:23.410
You know, if you guys can't even
take care of me around here

42:23.412 --> 42:29.483
like this, don't bother, and
you can tell that to Lane.

42:29.485 --> 42:30.484
Jack!

42:30.486 --> 42:32.853
Jack!

42:32.855 --> 42:36.223
You know, I do my part this
year, and I can't get a favor.

42:36.225 --> 42:39.826
It's just-- I don't even
know why I showed up.

42:39.828 --> 42:42.562
Where you gonna go?

42:42.564 --> 42:43.864
Somewhere I can work.

42:43.866 --> 42:47.000
It's a waste of fuel
to come in here.

43:07.522 --> 43:10.257
Narrator: Next time on
<i>Ice Road Truckers...</i>

43:10.259 --> 43:12.025
<i>I don't know what's up
with Jack right now.</i>

43:12.027 --> 43:14.961
<i>Narrator: With the haul
road ace MIA....</i>

43:14.963 --> 43:16.329
<i>Watch out, Jack Jessee.</i>

43:16.331 --> 43:18.331
<i>I've got your number.</i>

43:18.333 --> 43:21.067
<i>Narrator: Everyone's
gunning for the top spot.</i>

43:21.069 --> 43:22.235
<i>Dig, bitch!</i>

43:22.237 --> 43:24.137
<i>Get off my ass!</i>

43:24.139 --> 43:27.307
<i>My nice guy level
is running out.</i>

43:27.309 --> 43:31.211
<i>Narrator: - On the Dempster...
- 15,000 pounds overweight.</i>

43:31.213 --> 43:33.480
<i>Narrator: Alex pushes
the limit...</i>

43:33.482 --> 43:38.018
<i>There's always a possibility of
breaking the ice and going through.</i>

43:38.020 --> 43:40.520
<i>Narrator: - And on the winter roads...
- They stopped us, they</i>

43:40.522 --> 43:41.288
<i>threatened to arrest us.</i>

43:41.290 --> 43:42.589
<i>Somebody pissed somebody off.</i>

43:42.591 --> 43:44.224
<i>Fucking bunch of shit.</i>

43:44.226 --> 43:45.292
<i>Bullshit.</i>

43:45.294 --> 43:48.862
<i>Narrator: Complete meltdown.</i>

43:48.864 --> 43:53.133
<i>Yeah, make sure nobody
goes in there.</i>

43:56.571 --> 43:58.505
<i>We're in lockdown.</i>
