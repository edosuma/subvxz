This is going to be great.

01:33.534 --> 01:35.484
Going back to the source.

01:35.534 --> 01:38.484
The Pilgrims came from
Lincolnshire. From Boston.

01:38.534 --> 01:40.484
The original Boston,
and probably the best.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.844
- Probably.
- Probably.

01:43.894 --> 01:47.484
Look, you're not going to miss
Miami. What did you call it?

01:47.534 --> 01:49.634
Sweaty swamp with snakes walking upright?

01:51.574 --> 01:54.004
- We need this.
- And I need my fourth new school

01:54.054 --> 01:56.534
in six years. Way to parent, Dad.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.484

Dial down the Hallmark, Chief Hixon.

Here in the old country,
it's more irony and sarcasm.

02:06.534 --> 02:08.484
Like I said...

02:08.533 --> 02:10.324
"Wild Bill".

02:10.374 --> 02:11.484
Love it.

02:11.534 --> 02:13.484
- Do you really?
- No.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.534
That was me trying sarcasm.

02:18.534 --> 02:21.484
Bentley, huh? Must be good to be
Crime Commissioner around here.

02:21.534 --> 02:23.534
That payday wouldn't fill the tank.

02:25.534 --> 02:27.484
How far exactly is it
from London to Boston?

02:27.534 --> 02:29.534
Not far enough.

02:33.574 --> 02:36.484
'Boston may not be typical.

02:36.534 --> 02:38.324
'The level of immigration
here is much higher

02:38.374 --> 02:39.484
'than the rest of the UK.'

02:39.534 --> 02:41.510
'It's created some huge
social problems, of course.

02:41.534 --> 02:43.844
'There's a lot of local people

02:43.894 --> 02:45.484
'There's a kind of rejection and blame

02:45.534 --> 02:47.684
'when you don't feel accepted and welcome.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.214
'People just lose hope.'

02:53.534 --> 02:54.484
I saw it on Street View,

02:54.534 --> 02:57.484
but somehow I don't think Google
quite captured its magnificence.

02:57.534 --> 03:00.214
Boston's got the highest
murder rate in England.

03:01.534 --> 03:04.334
- We're all over the papers.
- Yeah, ten homicides last year.

03:05.534 --> 03:07.534
- In Miami, we had 150.
- Are you boasting, Bill?

03:08.534 --> 03:10.484
Brits don't like boasters.

03:10.534 --> 03:12.484
This is a perfect place
for a lad like you,

03:12.534 --> 03:13.934
looking to make a comeback.

03:14.734 --> 03:17.484
You solve a couple of
murders by year's end,

03:17.534 --> 03:20.164
you'll have 100% clear-up rate.

03:20.214 --> 03:22.484
And then you really will have
something to boast about,

03:22.534 --> 03:24.004
won't you? Eh?

03:25.534 --> 03:26.484
Howdy, y'all.

03:26.534 --> 03:30.684
Much obliged for the fine welcome
to this here East Lincolnshire.

03:30.734 --> 03:32.484
Shire Sheriff's office.

03:32.534 --> 03:35.534
We are going to be making us a
few changes around these parts.

03:37.534 --> 03:41.534
As our nation's president
once memorably said...

03:42.894 --> 03:44.534
"You're fired."

03:47.534 --> 03:49.484
That's a pretty good accent.

03:49.534 --> 03:51.234
What were you going for? West Texas?

03:52.534 --> 03:55.004
- Lubbock?
- Er, I don't really know, sir.

03:55.054 --> 03:57.484
I just, you know, cowboy
and that. John Wayne...

03:57.534 --> 03:59.534
Are you still talking?

04:04.074 --> 04:05.484
I've never actually been to Texas.

04:05.534 --> 04:09.484
I have, however, been to UCLA where
I got my degree in criminology.

04:09.534 --> 04:11.484
To go along with my Master's from Yale.

04:11.534 --> 04:13.844
I also have a doctorate in
statistical mapping from MIT,

04:13.894 --> 04:15.510
although I don't use
the whole doctor thing,

04:15.534 --> 04:18.684
cos nobody likes a wise-ass,
isn't that right, PC Drakes?

04:18.733 --> 04:21.004
But you are right about one thing...

04:21.053 --> 04:25.484
Your government demands a
10% cut in your budget...

04:25.534 --> 04:28.484
to go along with the 10%
reduction in crime rate.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.484
And that's where I come in.

04:30.534 --> 04:34.484
I was America's top metropolitan
police chief three years running.

04:34.534 --> 04:38.484
I ran departments in San
Diego, Denver, Miami.

04:38.534 --> 04:39.484
And now, East Lincs.

04:39.534 --> 04:42.484
What the Sergio Aguero are you doing here?

04:42.534 --> 04:45.004
My ancestors are from
here. Boston, Lincolnshire.

04:45.054 --> 04:47.484
- Came over in the Mayflower.
- Really, sir?

04:47.534 --> 04:49.164
Fuck, no.

04:49.214 --> 04:51.484
I'm the best at what I
do, you need what I do.

04:51.534 --> 04:52.484
Your numbers are bad.

04:52.534 --> 04:53.484
I'm here to find out how bad.

04:53.534 --> 04:55.534
You can't police with numbers.

04:56.534 --> 04:58.484
I'm almost glad you said that.

04:58.534 --> 05:02.484
21st-century policing
is only about numbers.

05:02.534 --> 05:05.484
Length of time to charge is now 18 days.

05:05.534 --> 05:07.030
That's four days worse than last year.

05:07.054 --> 05:10.484
Crime convictions are down 15% to 9%.

05:10.534 --> 05:12.484
There is one area in
which you are succeeding,

05:12.534 --> 05:14.484
you have the highest
murder rate in the country.

05:14.534 --> 05:16.484
So, congratulations on THAT.

05:16.534 --> 05:18.484
I've got some bugger
nicking satellite dishes

05:18.534 --> 05:19.484
off council estates.

05:19.534 --> 05:22.164
You'll not catch bugger from
behind t'laptop, will ya?

05:22.214 --> 05:24.484
I could police this whole
county from Miami Beach

05:24.534 --> 05:26.374
with a cell phone and good Wi-Fi.

05:27.534 --> 05:29.484
But I'm not on a beach.

05:29.534 --> 05:31.484
I'm here.

05:31.534 --> 05:33.164
For some reason. Oh.

05:33.214 --> 05:35.534
I almost forgot. The inspirational stuff.

05:36.894 --> 05:38.484
My dad was a cop.

05:38.534 --> 05:40.484
Patrolled the same beat from the age of 18

05:40.534 --> 05:42.534
until they forced him out at 67.

05:43.534 --> 05:46.164
I watched it grind him down

05:46.214 --> 05:48.484
year after year like trying to beat back

05:48.534 --> 05:51.534
a wildfire of social
disintegration with a fly swatter.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.134
That's not going to happen to you.

05:55.534 --> 05:58.324
When I leave here, you will
have lost your grey frowns

05:58.374 --> 06:01.524
and defensive negativity, and you
will actually want to come to work.

06:01.574 --> 06:05.484
And that will do a lot more to help
you and the community you serve

06:05.534 --> 06:06.484
than a pat on the back

06:06.534 --> 06:10.484
and some more bullshit about how
policing is all about people.

06:10.534 --> 06:12.534
Yee-ha.

06:20.534 --> 06:22.484
Daddy's home.

06:22.534 --> 06:24.484
Well, there goes the
Christmas party budget.

06:24.534 --> 06:26.164
You must be Lydia. Lydia Price?

06:26.214 --> 06:28.324
- Deputy Chief Constable Price.
- Yeah.

06:28.374 --> 06:30.484
Thanks for running the
transition so smoothly.

06:30.534 --> 06:32.484
It is literally my job, sir.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.164
The problem around here, your numbers.

06:34.214 --> 06:36.510
- There aren't enough of them.
- Oh, would you prefer more crimes?

06:36.534 --> 06:38.004
It would help my algorithm.

06:38.054 --> 06:40.484
I'll have a word with the
local criminal fraternity,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.484
- see if they can't up their game.
- Lydia.

06:42.534 --> 06:45.484
I'm just going to ask one
thing of you. I'm American.

06:45.534 --> 06:47.734
If you're going to stab
me, stab me in the front.

07:02.374 --> 07:04.524
Maybe I should go meet the principal.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.484
Kelsey!

07:06.534 --> 07:08.484
Kelsey.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.534
Call me.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.844
'Hey, Doc, it's me, I just
dropped her off at school.'

07:16.894 --> 07:18.484
'How's she doing over there?'

07:18.534 --> 07:21.484
'I don't know. She tries
so hard to fit in...'

07:21.534 --> 07:24.484
'OK, OK, I suggest we wait and see.'

07:24.534 --> 07:26.324
The problem with waiting and seeing

07:26.374 --> 07:28.510
is sometimes you wait and see and
your 12-year-old daughter is...

07:28.534 --> 07:30.684
'OK, OK, I will give her a call.'

07:30.734 --> 07:32.524
That would be great. Thank you.

07:32.574 --> 07:34.484
I'll send you her UK cell.

07:34.534 --> 07:37.534
'All right, Bill. Bye, Bill.'

07:40.534 --> 07:42.534
Any means of identification, please, sir.

07:44.534 --> 07:46.484
37 miles an hour, awesome!

07:46.534 --> 07:48.484
That means 20.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.484
20's plenty where people live.

07:50.534 --> 07:52.484
Well, DC Cobley, I'll
make sure you're put up

07:52.534 --> 07:53.484
for tightass of the month.

07:53.534 --> 07:56.484
Shouldn't you be on an estate somewhere?

07:56.534 --> 07:58.004
Trying to catch the satellite thief?

07:58.054 --> 07:59.484
No, there's a ban on overtime, sir.

07:59.534 --> 08:02.484
Don't need any overtime,
there's a pattern to the thefts.

08:02.534 --> 08:05.484
No pattern. Random times, random days.

08:05.534 --> 08:09.484
My algorithm runs details of crime
against government statistics,

08:09.534 --> 08:11.484
weather and about 300 other things

08:11.534 --> 08:13.550
that a human being of limited
bandwidth wouldn't understand.

08:13.574 --> 08:16.484
All the crimes take place
between dawn and dusk

08:16.534 --> 08:19.484
- within 48 hours of major sporting events.
- Right?

08:19.534 --> 08:22.484
PGA, WNBA, FA Cup, whatever
the fuck that is...

08:22.534 --> 08:25.484
- He's nicking them to order.
- Exactly.

08:26.534 --> 08:29.484
Champions League, tomorrow
night. Exactly. Right.

08:29.534 --> 08:31.844
So, eight hours of surveillance,
three cops over two days,

08:31.894 --> 08:34.484
- no overtime needed.
- That's brilliant, sir.

08:34.534 --> 08:36.484
80 quid.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.534
Half-price if you pay within 14 days.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.534
Oof! Bastard! Argh!

09:03.534 --> 09:04.894
Come here!

09:07.214 --> 09:09.484
He's heading due east
along the ground floor.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.534
Climbing up a floor.

09:18.374 --> 09:21.534
Go, get him! Up a floor, now!

09:35.534 --> 09:36.894
Try and keep up, lads.

to know all about you.

10:35.870 --> 10:38.820
In fact, your photograph was the
most clicked face of February.

10:38.870 --> 10:39.820
I think it's the teeth.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.846
We haven't got anything as
white and shiny round here.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.820
- Well, my teeth are my greatest asset.
- Oh, good.

10:44.870 --> 10:47.820
OK, quickfire round: Marmalade or Marmite?

10:47.870 --> 10:48.820
OK, now you're just making up words.

10:48.870 --> 10:51.860
Pyjamas or birthday suit?

10:51.910 --> 10:53.820
Seriously?

10:53.870 --> 10:56.820
I'm a cop. Just me and my six shooter.

10:56.870 --> 10:58.820
Brexit. In or out?

10:58.870 --> 11:00.870
In, obviously.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.820
Or... out?

11:04.870 --> 11:06.820
What's your greatest fear?

11:06.870 --> 11:08.820
That my father was right about me.

11:08.870 --> 11:10.820
Oh, snakes.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.820
Snakes are my greatest fear.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.820
OK, well, thank you, Lisa.

11:14.870 --> 11:17.820
The Chief Constable is anxious
to get back to his desk, so...

11:17.870 --> 11:20.870
I thought this was a meet and
greet? He hasn't met or gret.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.820
Well, why don't we start right here?

11:23.870 --> 11:26.550
Looks like a fine, patriotic household.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.180
Hello.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.820
I'm the new Chief Constable.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.820
No, you're not.

11:35.870 --> 11:36.820
You're American.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.660
The Home Office directive of 2014

11:39.710 --> 11:41.820
opened recruitment of senior officers

11:41.870 --> 11:44.820
- to citizens of foreign countries.
- Why?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.846
Because they spent two years
trying to find a Chief Constable

11:46.870 --> 11:50.820
for East Lincolnshire and no
British CC wanted to touch the job.

11:50.870 --> 11:53.970
I'm sure they didn't spin it that
way when they wooed you, though.

11:54.870 --> 11:57.820
Up it, you two, section commanders
and above on walkabouts.

11:57.870 --> 11:59.820
I'm not here for his bloody walkabout.

11:59.870 --> 12:02.820
It's a resolved MissPers case,
ma'am. Mum lives at number 42.

12:02.870 --> 12:03.820
Well, the press are here, Muriel,

12:03.870 --> 12:06.660
maybe the new Chief would
like to deliver the good news.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.310
That's the thing. It's resolved,
but it's not good news.

12:11.870 --> 12:13.820
What's he going to do?

12:13.870 --> 12:15.820
I haven't had any grief
counselling training.

12:15.870 --> 12:17.870
You and every other copper in Boston, sir.

12:29.910 --> 12:32.870
She's not home.

12:38.910 --> 12:41.050
Are you Angela Stainsford?

12:42.870 --> 12:44.820
Yeah.

12:44.870 --> 12:46.820
That's me.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.870
Mother of Melissa Jane Stainsford?

12:52.870 --> 12:55.670
Been waiting ten years for
you lot to knock on that door.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.020
Yeah, that's Mel.

13:01.070 --> 13:03.870
I said, "Just go off and see the world."

13:05.870 --> 13:08.710
"Don't be like your old
mum, stuck in this dump."

13:26.870 --> 13:28.870
Yeah.

13:32.910 --> 13:34.870
That's her.

13:35.870 --> 13:39.020
My baby. My baby.

13:39.070 --> 13:42.820
'So, he just found a severed head,
kept in the freezer for ten years?'

13:42.870 --> 13:45.870
He's distraught, poor lad. He
didn't realise she was real.

13:46.870 --> 13:49.820
Thought she was some hippy's art project.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.820
So why did he keep her
head in a freezer, then?

13:51.870 --> 13:54.860
- Thought she were made of marzipan.
- A marzipan art project.

13:54.910 --> 13:56.820
Yeah, well, it's Arthur, sir,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.820
he's a known nutter, but he's no killer.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.870
Where the hell am I?

14:06.390 --> 14:09.820
Sorry about the ears. What ears? Exactly.

14:09.870 --> 14:12.820
They, er, snapped off when we took
the earrings out for identification.

14:12.870 --> 14:16.820
- So, you're thinking... Ten years?
- It's anyone's guess.

14:16.870 --> 14:18.820
That's the wonderful
thing about deepfreeze.

14:18.870 --> 14:20.370
Fresh as the day it was picked.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.820
Mineral deposits suggest
she was from the area,

14:23.870 --> 14:26.020
hair tests positive for
cannabis from root to tip.

14:26.070 --> 14:29.340
Well, then again, so
would mine. So, sue me.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.820
So, did this happen before she
died? Or was it post-mortem?

14:31.870 --> 14:34.820
Blood was still flowing when the
head was severed. Look at the cut.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.820
No ragged edges. That's...

14:38.550 --> 14:41.820
...one single blow. Would have taken
a hell of a lot of strength, that.

14:41.870 --> 14:44.820
And a hell of a weapon.
Carbon reinforced steel.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.820
Found it in a C-one Atlas.

14:46.870 --> 14:49.820
You're looking for a machete,
a sword, an axe, perhaps.

14:49.870 --> 14:51.820
Even an industrial cutter.

14:51.870 --> 14:52.870
Any DNA on that blade?

14:54.390 --> 14:57.820
- You don't have a DNA sequencer?
- It's 250 grand!

14:57.870 --> 15:00.820
- It's just very common where I come from.
- You mean America.

15:00.870 --> 15:02.870
I mean the 21st-century.

15:06.910 --> 15:10.870
Yeah, so, she just walked out
the door one Thursday night.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.820
- We had words, but...
- Can I ask, what about?

15:14.870 --> 15:17.820
Boys. Nothing.

15:17.870 --> 15:19.870
Mother daughter stuff.

15:20.870 --> 15:23.170
You still haven't told
me what's happened to her.

15:24.870 --> 15:27.820
Would you rather speak to
a family liaison officer?

15:27.870 --> 15:29.820
I've talked to the FLOs.

15:29.870 --> 15:31.820
Mm. Yeah.

15:31.870 --> 15:34.820
They drank my tea and talked my legs off.

15:34.870 --> 15:36.070
Never found her, though.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.870
Never looked for her, far as I can tell.

15:40.870 --> 15:42.820
So... boys.

15:42.870 --> 15:45.870
She weren't no slag, if
that's what you're thinking.

15:46.870 --> 15:50.870
That was me. I like the
boys and they like me.

15:52.870 --> 15:57.500
No, Mel was the serious one.
Into exams and everything.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.820
So, she had a serious boyfriend?

15:59.870 --> 16:03.820
Well, yeah, I mean, her and
Marek were pretty keen.

16:03.870 --> 16:06.500
You know, they were gonna go off together.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.820
Marek? So he was Polish?

16:08.870 --> 16:10.820
Presumably still is.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.070
He's still around. He's cut his hair.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.820
Did you suspect he had anything to
do with Melissa's disappearance?

16:17.870 --> 16:19.820
Well, you would think so, wouldn't you?

16:19.870 --> 16:21.370
But you lot didn't go after him.

16:21.870 --> 16:24.820
You know, I see those foreign
lads on my way to work.

16:24.870 --> 16:27.020
They're on the strong lager at 7 AM.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.820
A lot of them work night shifts.

16:29.870 --> 16:33.070
So, when we're on our breakfast,
they are on their after-work drinks.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.870
How does that help Melissa?

16:37.870 --> 16:39.870
I don't suppose it does, really.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.820
I need to know everyone
that she knew. Mrs Stains...

16:44.870 --> 16:45.970
I was a terrible mother!

16:48.230 --> 16:50.870
I suppose you've realised
that already, haven't ya?

16:54.870 --> 16:56.870
I failed her.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.390
Now your turn, Miss Plod.

17:03.870 --> 17:05.970
What's so bloody awful
that you can't tell me?

17:06.869 --> 17:09.819
Love you.

17:09.869 --> 17:11.819
Ms Stainsford, how are you?

17:11.869 --> 17:14.869
How the bloody hell do you think I am?

17:15.869 --> 17:17.869
Who did that to my little girl?

17:18.869 --> 17:20.819
We are going to find out.

17:20.869 --> 17:24.819
I give you my word, I have
every confidence in young...

17:24.869 --> 17:27.819
- Muriel, sir.
- Her?!

17:27.869 --> 17:31.820
She's 12. You're going to send
a tweenager to catch a maniac?!

17:31.870 --> 17:34.820
I found the current address for
Melissa's former boyfriend.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.820
Marek Rudnicka. I'm going there now.

17:36.870 --> 17:38.846
Yeah, well, he does Muay Thai,
so I wouldn't let her go alone.

17:38.870 --> 17:41.860
Ms Stainsford, Mr Hixon
is Chief Constable.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.710
You don't understand, you don't have kids.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.870
And you haven't lost a daughter, have you?

17:56.870 --> 17:58.870
I thought I had.

18:04.870 --> 18:07.820
I'm not like everyone else,
sir, I'm excited you're here.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.180
It's like Ronaldo signed
for the Imps, you know?

18:11.870 --> 18:13.820
Love what you did in Cincinnati.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.820
Pro-oriented police reform.

18:15.870 --> 18:18.820
69 point drop in citizen complaints,

18:18.870 --> 18:22.020
56% down on citizen fatalities
during encounters with police...

18:22.070 --> 18:23.820
Tell me about Queen Anne's.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.820
- The street, the park, the pub, or the posh school?
- The school.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.820
My daughter's just
started. What's the story?

18:29.870 --> 18:31.820
Do they have any issues there?

18:31.870 --> 18:33.820
Any substance abuse, that kind of thing?

18:33.870 --> 18:36.860
We ran a self-harm awareness
event there last Halloween,

18:36.910 --> 18:38.870
that was well attended.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.030
I like you, Yeardsley, you remind
me of me when I was your age.

18:43.070 --> 18:46.820
Smarter than the rest,
misunderstood, overweight,

18:46.870 --> 18:50.820
- if you must know. - Seriously?
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

18:50.870 --> 18:52.820
Er, I'm not fat.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.820
I'm farm stock. I've got
three older brothers.

18:55.870 --> 18:58.860
Every ounce of flesh is a war
I've waged for my very existence.

18:58.910 --> 19:02.500
This isn't fat, it's
prime Lincolnshire pork.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.820
It's good you're turning a disadvantage...

19:04.870 --> 19:06.870
This isn't a disadvantage.

19:08.870 --> 19:11.870
Mr Rudnicka? Marek Rudnicka?

19:12.870 --> 19:14.820
It's Ruddy now. Mark Ruddy.

19:14.870 --> 19:18.820
Boston's the Brexit capital of
Britain. Ruddy plays better.

19:18.870 --> 19:19.870
Check the fuel tank.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.820
Er, We'd like to talk to
you about the disappearance

19:23.870 --> 19:25.660
of Melissa Stainsford.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.010
Any idea where she might be?

19:27.870 --> 19:30.820
You don't think you lot came
knocking down my door ten years ago?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.500
Excuse me.

19:34.870 --> 19:36.870
- OK.
- Jurek.

19:45.870 --> 19:48.820
I've had pickers on my farm
from Poznan since I were a kid.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.820
What happened between you
and Melissa Stainsford?

19:51.870 --> 19:54.820
We'd saved up to go travelling.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.820
Dubai, the Big Apple...

19:56.870 --> 20:00.870
- But you didn't go.
- Packed my bags, Mel didn't show.

20:02.344 --> 20:04.820
Her mum said she hadn't seen her.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.820
I figured she ditched me and
went off with another bloke.

20:07.870 --> 20:09.820
Nice place, this.

20:09.870 --> 20:13.340
We are now the top agricultural
plant hire south of Grimsby.

20:13.390 --> 20:17.820
Er, you started off with two plate
fillers and an onion loader.

20:17.870 --> 20:20.820
Massey Ferguson said you
put down 100 grand cash.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.870
Less then a year after
Melissa's disappearance.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.820
It's a nice D-700 combine, that.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.820
Carbon steel blades?

20:29.870 --> 20:31.660
I have a wife and family now.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.820
Wherever Melissa Stainsford
is, I've moved on.

20:33.870 --> 20:36.020
You should stop referring
to her in the present tense.

20:36.070 --> 20:37.180
Melissa's dead.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.550
Somebody cut off her head
and put it in a field.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.671
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

20:57.671 --> 20:59.621
I thought you'd been abducted by aliens.

20:59.671 --> 21:01.621
I called you 11 times.

21:01.671 --> 21:02.621
Yeah, Dr Marks called me

21:02.671 --> 21:04.821
and warned me you were
losing your shit again.

21:04.871 --> 21:06.621
I am not losing my shit.

21:06.671 --> 21:08.621
I'm just checking up on you.

21:08.671 --> 21:10.621
New school, new country...

21:10.671 --> 21:14.621
It's a school, Dad. Same backed up
toilets, same bat-shit teachers.

21:14.671 --> 21:16.621
No Pledge of Allegiance, though.

21:16.671 --> 21:18.671
- Honestly, these people...
- Yeah.

21:19.671 --> 21:21.671
Do they seem happy to you?

21:22.671 --> 21:24.847
I think they make it a
particular point of national pride

21:24.871 --> 21:26.671
to be miserable all the time.

21:42.671 --> 21:44.621
Well, this is a bit
coal-faced for you, isn't it?

21:44.671 --> 21:47.461
I thought you were strictly upstairs?

21:47.511 --> 21:50.621
The building only has two floors
and both of them are downstairs.

21:50.671 --> 21:52.141
How can I help you?

21:52.191 --> 21:54.981
A number. That's your forte, innit?

21:55.031 --> 21:57.621
How many are you here to get rid of?

21:57.671 --> 21:59.301
You're here to cut jobs.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.621
I reckon it's what got
you the gig. So, how many?

22:01.671 --> 22:02.621
- Six.
- Six? Well...

22:02.671 --> 22:04.621
Hundred.

22:04.671 --> 22:08.621
Combining departments, outsourcing
back-office and custody work.

22:08.671 --> 22:11.621
Oh, and before you ask, just fine.

22:11.671 --> 22:14.621
- I sleep just fine.
- 600.

22:14.671 --> 22:16.621
So that's why you're here.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.821
Hello?

22:20.871 --> 22:22.821
'I think I'm onto something, sir.'

22:22.871 --> 22:25.621
I've run your algorithms,
cross-referencing and that.

22:25.671 --> 22:28.621
Melissa Stainsford had a Lincs Pass.

22:28.671 --> 22:30.621
I've got the data.

22:30.671 --> 22:33.621
She took the same bus nearly every
day to a place near Anton's Gowt.

22:33.671 --> 22:35.621
Where are you, Yeardsley?

22:35.671 --> 22:38.621
Er, I'm on the number 64
hopper with PC Cobley.

22:38.671 --> 22:40.621
Cobley? What's he doing
there? He's a beat cop.

22:40.671 --> 22:43.191
My bloody head. I found it.

22:49.871 --> 22:53.671
- So, this is the bustling metropolis of Anton's Gowt.
- Yep.

22:54.671 --> 22:56.621
What is a gowt, anyway?

22:56.671 --> 22:58.671
What was Melissa doing here?

22:59.671 --> 23:01.621
Follow me.

23:01.671 --> 23:04.191
I used to play here when I was a kid.

23:07.671 --> 23:09.621
These are bunkers.

23:09.671 --> 23:12.671
Left over from the war. I'm
sure this was the place.

23:14.511 --> 23:16.621
Yeah, I remember, we used to hide out here

23:16.671 --> 23:18.621
and there was a way we could get in.

23:23.031 --> 23:24.671
Bugger me!

23:26.671 --> 23:27.671
Jesus Christ!

23:29.671 --> 23:32.621
So we have four tables, 30 foot long,

23:32.671 --> 23:34.621
plants eight inches apart,

23:34.671 --> 23:40.141
so 180 plants, $300 per plant per
harvest, four harvests a year...

23:40.191 --> 23:42.621
That's $200,000.

23:42.671 --> 23:47.461
So, Melissa wasn't just smoking it,
she were growing it, wholesale.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.621
Melissa? Nah...

23:49.671 --> 23:52.621
Operation this size,
take a bit of know-how.

23:52.671 --> 23:54.351
Or somebody already knew how.

23:55.671 --> 23:57.621
Ruddy Marek!

23:57.671 --> 23:59.981
Mel was the brains. I
was just the gardener.

24:00.031 --> 24:01.981
We had so much of it, we
didn't know what to do.

24:02.031 --> 24:04.671
We had Sainsbury's bags full of the stuff.

24:05.671 --> 24:08.621
We needed to find someone to
take that volume off of us.

24:08.671 --> 24:10.031
Someone?

24:11.671 --> 24:12.991
There was this Russian in town...

24:13.031 --> 24:16.461
What Russian? You mean Kraznov?

24:16.511 --> 24:17.671
Oleg Kraznov?

24:20.671 --> 24:23.271
His guys were selling shitty
weed at twice the price.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.461
Melissa did a deal with them.

24:26.511 --> 24:28.141
300 grand for the lot.

24:28.191 --> 24:30.621
- 300 grand?
- Yes.

24:30.671 --> 24:32.621
Between the two of you?

24:32.671 --> 24:35.671
So, where is it? Where's the money?

24:37.031 --> 24:40.621
I mean, if Oleg Kraznov
gave you 300 grand,

24:40.671 --> 24:43.671
where's Melissa's share?

24:45.671 --> 24:49.671
Mr Hopkins has been holding
this in his safe for ten years.

24:51.671 --> 24:55.621
It's all there. 150 grand.

24:55.671 --> 24:57.671
Waiting for Mel to come and get it.

25:07.518 --> 25:09.468
Well, that's a first.

25:09.518 --> 25:11.468
We've had dog, raccoon, even human...

25:11.518 --> 25:13.828
but nothing this big.

25:13.878 --> 25:17.468
Some of them are going to lose their
jobs, they need to blame somebody.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.468
If you hired a baby-sitter, I'll kill you.

25:21.518 --> 25:23.468
Go back inside. Right now.

25:23.518 --> 25:26.468
- Go on.
- Is that the one whose daughter died?

25:26.518 --> 25:27.468
How do you know about that?

25:27.518 --> 25:29.468
Head in a fridge? Massive clickbait.

25:29.518 --> 25:31.494
I don't want you are looking
at that kind of a thing.

25:31.518 --> 25:33.968
- You can't protect me all my life.
- I'm a cop. It's my job.

25:34.018 --> 25:35.468
You're not a cop.

25:35.518 --> 25:37.494
Granddad was a cop, but you're
smarter than that, remember?

25:37.518 --> 25:39.518
I heard you arrested Marek.

25:40.558 --> 25:42.518
What did he say?

25:43.518 --> 25:45.828
Ms Stainsford, I can't possibly...

25:45.878 --> 25:47.518
I'm sorry, I can't stop...

25:49.518 --> 25:52.508
...thinking about how Mel died.

25:52.558 --> 25:54.916
Hi. I'm Kelsey.

25:54.917 --> 25:56.468
Hi, Kelsey.

25:56.518 --> 26:00.518
- This is Angie. She is...
- I'm a nobody.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.468
I'm sorry to disturb you.

26:04.518 --> 26:06.358
Do you like pizza? Angie?

26:06.807 --> 26:09.198
Dad forgot to book a baby-sitter.

26:10.518 --> 26:12.988
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.518
It would really help us
out, wouldn't it, Dad?

26:17.558 --> 26:19.198
Sure.

26:20.639 --> 26:22.505
Come on.

26:49.965 --> 26:50.965
Bravo!

26:56.465 --> 27:00.415
- This is Bill Hixon.
- Our new Chief Constable.

27:00.465 --> 27:01.415
Lady Harborough.

27:01.465 --> 27:03.775
Lady H is my mum. I'm Mary.

27:03.825 --> 27:07.415
The Right Honourable Judge
Mary Harborough, QC.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.145
- Drink?
- Please.

27:10.465 --> 27:12.415
I suppose it's only fair.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.415
We sent enough of our
cast-offs to the States.

27:15.465 --> 27:18.415
I'm pretty sure my ancestors
left of their own volition.

27:18.465 --> 27:21.415
- Probably had something to do with the food.
- Ta.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.441
Wait a minute, you're not
the same Judge Harborough

27:23.465 --> 27:26.415
who granted bail to the satellite
thief this morning, are you?

27:26.465 --> 27:29.415
Mr Dennison has three young children

27:29.465 --> 27:32.415
and a wife currently undergoing
radiotherapy at Lincoln County.

27:32.465 --> 27:34.415
I get it. If I grew up in a castle,

27:34.465 --> 27:36.415
I'd probably try to help
the peasants as well.

27:36.465 --> 27:40.985
Mr Hixon, you are everything
I thought you'd be.

27:43.465 --> 27:44.985
Only more ripped.

27:46.465 --> 27:50.415
Our deep thanks go to Lord and
Lady Harborough for hosting us

27:50.465 --> 27:54.415
to raise funds for the Kraznov
wing of the children's hospice,

27:54.465 --> 27:56.415
here at Stickney.

27:56.965 --> 27:59.415
So, that's Oleg Kraznov, huh?

27:59.465 --> 28:01.415
The very man.

28:01.465 --> 28:04.415
Kraznov does a lot of
work for charity, Bill.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.415
He runs a haulage firm out of Grimsby.

28:06.465 --> 28:10.415
KTT refrigerated trucks, the
construction business, all the rest.

28:10.465 --> 28:13.465
Just classic front for organised crime.

28:15.465 --> 28:17.415
Right. He's coming over.

28:17.465 --> 28:21.415
Try not to talk shop. I'm
not that stupid. Mm...

28:21.465 --> 28:24.415
- Bill Hixon, Chief Constable.
- Kraznov.

28:24.465 --> 28:27.415
Thank you for supporting
our little evening. Please.

28:27.465 --> 28:29.415
This is my community now.

28:29.465 --> 28:32.415
I can see how hard you've worked
to make it your community.

28:32.465 --> 28:35.465
I came to Lincolnshire to make
a better life for my family.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.145
What are you doing here?

28:39.505 --> 28:41.415
I'm looking for a psychotic killer.

28:41.465 --> 28:44.415
Mm. I read about that girl.

28:44.465 --> 28:47.455
"That girl's" name was Melissa Stainsford.

28:47.505 --> 28:49.415
She was 19-years-old.

28:49.465 --> 28:52.465
And a known business
associate of Oleg Kraznov.

28:54.465 --> 28:57.095
Isn't that your car, Chief Constable?

28:57.145 --> 28:58.845
Looks like someone's stealing it.

29:05.985 --> 29:08.465
Hey! Hey!

29:09.505 --> 29:11.415
I am so sorry, ma'am.

29:11.465 --> 29:14.465
- I need to borrow this for police business.
- Right...

29:24.465 --> 29:25.465
Fuck!

29:29.825 --> 29:31.465
Goddamn it!

29:39.305 --> 29:40.415
Argh!

29:40.465 --> 29:42.465
He's going to do the dirty on her.

29:45.205 --> 29:48.155
Everyone's so... normal.

29:48.205 --> 29:52.155
You either get zeros or
thinner on American TV.

29:52.205 --> 29:55.195
Was it the Botox and anorexia? Is
that why your dad brought you here?

29:55.245 --> 29:57.155
I don't know why we're here.

29:57.205 --> 29:59.205
He doesn't exactly blend in.

30:00.205 --> 30:02.155
He doesn't blend in anywhere.

30:02.205 --> 30:04.155
He says it keeps him objective.

30:04.205 --> 30:06.515
Yours is the first case I've
seen him get involved in.

30:06.565 --> 30:09.155
He must really like you.

30:09.205 --> 30:11.205
It isn't about me.

30:17.205 --> 30:19.205
That's Mel.

30:21.245 --> 30:24.045
- That...
- Could be you.

30:33.205 --> 30:34.495
He's for it, now!

30:35.045 --> 30:37.195
'Fuck you! Was it worth it?

30:37.245 --> 30:40.205
- 'You mess around with
my daughter?' - Kelsey?

30:44.789 --> 30:46.789
Twat...

31:04.500 --> 31:05.739
'Fuck you, was it worth it?

31:05.789 --> 31:06.789
'Huh?

31:07.222 --> 31:10.664
You mess around
with my daughter?'

31:10.789 --> 31:11.789
Oh, my God...

31:17.093 --> 31:18.413
Who sent this?

31:20.413 --> 31:22.413
Christ!

31:35.141 --> 31:37.181
Right, well I'll leave you two to talk.

31:38.617 --> 31:39.817
We fuck them up, Mr Hixon.

31:41.457 --> 31:42.777
We don't mean to, but we do.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.777
That's a strange proverb, Angie.

31:47.777 --> 31:50.777
- But thank you.
- Well, I'll let myself out.

31:54.977 --> 31:57.727
At least now I know why we left Miami.

31:57.777 --> 31:59.777
You beat up the star quarterback.

32:01.777 --> 32:02.777
He was bullying you.

32:04.457 --> 32:05.727
And those photos...

32:05.777 --> 32:08.727
- How do you know about those?
- I'm the police.

32:08.777 --> 32:10.727
Did you go through my phone?

32:10.777 --> 32:12.777
What would you expect?!

32:15.777 --> 32:17.817
- After what happened.
- What happened?

32:21.777 --> 32:23.457
Go on, say it.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.777
Say it!

32:30.777 --> 32:32.477
My daughter tried to kill herself.

32:40.777 --> 32:43.727
Did you get fired? From Miami?

32:43.777 --> 32:46.727
Did you get fired because of this?

32:46.777 --> 32:49.727
He filed a complaint, the
Department paid him off,

32:49.777 --> 32:51.727
I agreed to quit.

32:51.777 --> 32:53.277
I didn't know there was a video.

32:54.777 --> 32:56.777
So that's why we're here.

32:57.777 --> 32:59.137
Because of me.

33:05.777 --> 33:07.727
You didn't tell me about the video.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.727
I didn't know about the video.

33:10.777 --> 33:12.727
I hired you to make me look good.

33:12.777 --> 33:14.727
Instead of that, I look like a dick.

33:14.777 --> 33:15.727
Again.

33:15.777 --> 33:17.727
- You hit a child!
- Oh, come on!

33:17.777 --> 33:20.727
He was 18-years-old and built
like a brick shit house.

33:20.777 --> 33:22.727
He put pictures of my
daughter on the internet.

33:22.777 --> 33:25.087
- He's lucky I left my gun at home.
- Wild Bill, eh?

33:25.137 --> 33:30.727
Well, you can take a few days off
until the fallout... falls out.

33:30.777 --> 33:32.727
Lydia's going to man the
fort in the meanwhile.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.727
And if I say no?

33:34.777 --> 33:37.727
Well, it's less of a suggestion,
more of a suspension.

33:37.777 --> 33:40.727
You can have two weeks off with no pay.

33:40.777 --> 33:42.727
I thought you were a lot
smarter than this, Bill.

33:42.777 --> 33:44.727
Oh, I am.

33:44.777 --> 33:46.777
I quit.

33:50.777 --> 33:52.457
Er, sir!

33:55.777 --> 33:57.727
Erm...

33:57.777 --> 34:02.457
That video of you was distributed
from our own servers.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.777
From this building? Are you sure?

34:08.777 --> 34:10.777
I need you to tell me who sent it.

34:12.777 --> 34:15.726
I can't. I owe her too much, sir.

34:15.777 --> 34:16.777
Lydia.

34:23.777 --> 34:25.777
Hey, you're not bailing
on us, are you, sir?

34:27.777 --> 34:28.726
Please.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.137
You promised Ms Stainsford, sir.

34:34.137 --> 34:35.726
What's this?

34:35.777 --> 34:39.726
You said to check the database for
cannabis arrests from back then.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.137
I didn't expect quite so many.

34:45.777 --> 34:47.726
Well...

34:47.777 --> 34:50.617
as you people like to
say, bugger me sideways.

34:51.777 --> 34:55.137
Caution for cannabis possession?
What does this have to do with...

34:58.777 --> 35:00.247
...me?

35:00.297 --> 35:03.407
I had a hard time keeping
that out of the paper.

35:03.457 --> 35:05.767
I was a pupil barrister
in London at the time,

35:05.817 --> 35:08.727
but I still came home every
weekend for my laundry

35:08.777 --> 35:11.247
and an eighth of Lincolnshire green gold.

35:11.297 --> 35:13.727
Our notes say you didn't
know your dealer's name?

35:13.777 --> 35:16.273
Or was it that you just didn't
want to make any trouble for her?

35:16.297 --> 35:18.777
It was Melissa Stainsford, wasn't it?

35:19.777 --> 35:21.767
She disappeared on January 8th,

35:21.817 --> 35:24.727
your caution was on January
10th, so you saw her.

35:24.777 --> 35:26.977
Did she seem frayed?

35:28.777 --> 35:29.727
Erm...

35:29.777 --> 35:32.727
She didn't turn up. It was a
man. Some bloke... Polish.

35:32.777 --> 35:35.727
Her boyfriend, he said.

35:35.777 --> 35:37.727
He'd been in a fight.

35:42.777 --> 35:44.727
It was Marek.

35:44.777 --> 35:47.727
He had scratches on him two
days after Melissa disappeared.

35:47.777 --> 35:49.087
I'm pulling into his yard now.

35:49.137 --> 35:52.777
'I thought you had resigned,
sir? Be careful, sir.'

35:57.457 --> 35:58.777
Shit. He's leaving.

36:02.457 --> 36:04.727
Yeardsley, what else you got on this?

36:04.777 --> 36:08.727
'Right. I've looked back
through his employment records.

36:08.777 --> 36:11.727
'When he first came to England,
Marek worked for Grimsby boats.

36:11.777 --> 36:14.727
- 'His gang master was...'
- Oleg Kraznov.

36:14.777 --> 36:17.767
'So they were in it
together. Kraznov and Marek.

36:17.817 --> 36:19.777
'They killed her for the weed.'

36:46.777 --> 36:49.087
Remind me never to partner with you.

36:49.137 --> 36:51.567
Partner?

36:51.617 --> 36:55.137
With some Polack farmer growing
weed in a council flat?

36:56.457 --> 36:58.777
Huh. Bollocks to that.

36:59.777 --> 37:01.777
Let's get you out of here.

37:04.137 --> 37:05.727
The Russian killed her.

37:05.777 --> 37:07.727
Did he? You're the one
who fought with her,

37:07.777 --> 37:09.753
you had scratches all over your
face, do you remember that?

37:09.777 --> 37:12.727
She threw a plate at me. A woman's
never thrown a plate at you?

37:12.777 --> 37:14.727
A Foreman Grill, once.
What did you fight about?

37:14.777 --> 37:17.727
I don't remember. It's what
we did. We fought, we made up.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.753
It doesn't matter what I say,
you still think I'm guilty.

37:19.777 --> 37:22.727
Oh, I know you're guilty, I just
don't know what you're guilty of.

37:22.777 --> 37:26.727
All right. Last chance.

37:26.777 --> 37:28.777
Tell me something I can understand.

37:30.777 --> 37:33.567
We fought, she got
emotional, it was nothing.

37:33.617 --> 37:35.727
Oh, please. This is
Lincolnshire, not Napoli.

37:35.777 --> 37:38.727
I've been here a week, already I
know Boston girls don't draw blood

37:38.777 --> 37:40.737
just cos you put a wet
towel on the bedroom floor!

37:40.777 --> 37:42.727
What did you do to her?

37:42.777 --> 37:44.777
Hey, what did you do to her?!

37:45.777 --> 37:46.977
I fucked another woman.

37:47.777 --> 37:49.137
OK?

37:54.777 --> 37:57.087
- Who'd you sleep with?
- Does it matter?

37:57.137 --> 37:58.727
Mel found out.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.727
It had nothing to do with her death.

38:00.777 --> 38:02.727
That Russian dupek chopped off her head

38:02.777 --> 38:04.727
and left it in the field for the crows,

38:04.777 --> 38:06.753
- and you're doing nothing about it.
- What about the weed factory?

38:06.777 --> 38:09.727
Somebody smashed that place up.
Oleg didn't even know where it was!

38:09.777 --> 38:11.877
What'd he say? "Growing
weed in a council flat"?

38:15.777 --> 38:17.727
Mel was pissed at you.

38:17.777 --> 38:21.087
And she smashed up the place
because you were fucking around!

38:21.137 --> 38:22.727
And then...

38:22.777 --> 38:25.777
And then she what?! Cut her own head off?

38:27.777 --> 38:28.727
I'm no detective, Mr Hixon.

38:28.777 --> 38:32.777
Clearly... neither are you.

38:51.777 --> 38:54.727
'Neither of them killed her.
None of this makes any sense.'

38:54.777 --> 38:56.727
Well, you know what they say, sir.

38:56.777 --> 38:58.727
When you've eliminated the impossible,

38:58.777 --> 39:01.727
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

39:01.777 --> 39:03.727
What idiot says that?
Her head was cut off.

39:03.777 --> 39:07.567
'She smashed the bunker, she
came out in this field...'

39:07.617 --> 39:08.767
We're making progress, sir.

39:08.817 --> 39:10.727
'There is no "we", DC Yeardsley.

39:10.777 --> 39:12.727
'There was no "we" when
I was Chief Constable,

39:12.777 --> 39:13.727
'there's even less of a "we" now.'

39:13.777 --> 39:16.407
I only came here to get my life on track.

39:16.457 --> 39:19.247
Now I'm disgraced, humiliated,
probably unemployable,

39:19.297 --> 39:21.727
my own daughter won't speak to
me, and she's the only reason

39:21.777 --> 39:24.767
I came to this godforsaken
cabbage patch in the first place!

39:24.817 --> 39:26.767
So, who did it, sir?

39:26.817 --> 39:29.727
Who cut off Melissa Stainsford's head?

39:29.777 --> 39:32.777
Were you listening? I don't do this.

39:39.297 --> 39:41.777
- No-one did it.
- 'What do you mean?'

39:43.777 --> 39:44.727
What are you on about, sir?

39:44.777 --> 39:47.777
'S... hello? Hello?'

39:57.777 --> 40:00.777
I'm sorry, Angie. We
know how Melissa died.

40:01.777 --> 40:04.377
She jumped off the wind
turbines in Langrick and...

40:04.977 --> 40:06.777
...the blades...

40:08.777 --> 40:12.297
I think Melissa found out
that Marek was cheating on her.

40:13.777 --> 40:14.777
Broke her heart.

40:17.137 --> 40:18.753
I wish there was something
that I could do,

40:18.777 --> 40:20.727
but nobody's responsible.

40:20.777 --> 40:22.777
Do you reckon?

40:24.297 --> 40:25.727
What about Marek?

40:25.777 --> 40:28.457
And that sad slag he shagged?

40:30.777 --> 40:32.777
They both...

40:34.777 --> 40:36.977
...they both may as
well have cut her throat.

41:07.297 --> 41:08.727
Poor Mel.

41:08.777 --> 41:10.777
Poor Angie!

41:12.777 --> 41:15.777
Yeah, she was shocked. And very upset.

41:16.777 --> 41:19.727
Wouldn't want to be the other woman
when Angie gets a hold of her.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.727
Girls can be vicious.

41:21.777 --> 41:22.777
What do you mean?

41:24.777 --> 41:27.777
Oh! It's Angie. It's a voicemail.

41:31.777 --> 41:33.247
What is she saying?

41:33.297 --> 41:35.087
She knows we're leaving...?

41:35.137 --> 41:38.457
It's so windy. I think
she's saying... goodbye?

41:39.777 --> 41:41.777
Christ!

41:56.777 --> 41:58.777
You stay here. Don't move!

42:01.777 --> 42:03.727
Shit.

42:19.777 --> 42:20.727
Angie!

42:20.777 --> 42:22.777
Leave me alone!

42:23.977 --> 42:26.457
This is between me and my daughter.

42:27.457 --> 42:30.727
- I know what happened.
- No, you don't!

42:30.777 --> 42:32.727
You were the other woman.

42:32.777 --> 42:34.247
Shut up.

42:34.297 --> 42:35.727
You slept with Marek.

42:35.777 --> 42:38.617
I said, shut up! Shut up.

42:41.777 --> 42:44.727
You knew he was a bad guy, you were
just trying to prove it to her.

42:44.777 --> 42:46.777
It's not your fault.

42:47.777 --> 42:50.727
I was jealous of her. I was
jealous of my own daughter.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.077
I shagged her boyfriend.

42:52.777 --> 42:55.727
And that's why she jumped.
That's what you said!

42:55.777 --> 42:58.777
Stop! Angie! Stop. Listen.

43:00.817 --> 43:02.817
There's 150 grand cash in a bag.

43:04.777 --> 43:05.727
You can have it.

43:05.777 --> 43:08.727
You can use it to help
people... I don't know.

43:08.777 --> 43:10.727
I'm way out of my league, here.

43:10.777 --> 43:12.777
She hated me!

43:13.777 --> 43:16.767
And there was me, I was
thinking, she could be somewhere.

43:16.817 --> 43:19.567
She could be living somewhere,

43:19.617 --> 43:20.727
happy.

43:20.777 --> 43:23.777
You got a second chance
with your daughter.

43:25.457 --> 43:26.817
But what about me?

43:29.457 --> 43:31.777
I never got a chance to say sorry.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.777
I think you just did.

43:42.777 --> 43:44.727
Whoa, what's wrong?

43:44.777 --> 43:49.727
I took two boxes of Aspridine
Extra in case I chickened out.

43:49.777 --> 43:52.727
Kelsey! Call an ambulance!

43:52.777 --> 43:54.777
OK! OK!

44:00.777 --> 44:02.777
Mel? Mel!

44:04.777 --> 44:06.457
I'm so sorry.

44:25.777 --> 44:28.727
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.
- I'm so sorry...

44:28.777 --> 44:30.817
Stay with me. It'll be OK.

44:46.777 --> 44:48.727
Already dressed for Houston.

44:48.777 --> 44:51.617
And goodbye to the good people of Britain.

44:53.457 --> 44:56.727
What if they're actually happy,
Dad? And it's you that's miserable?

44:56.777 --> 44:58.727
Me? Miserable?

44:58.777 --> 45:01.877
There are boxes in the garage
that we haven't touched since Mom.

45:07.777 --> 45:11.727
My God, you'd stay... here.

45:11.777 --> 45:14.727
You're a cop here, Dad. You look...

45:14.777 --> 45:15.817
Like a drowning man?

45:16.777 --> 45:18.777
You looked like Grampa.

45:21.777 --> 45:23.727
Jesus.

45:23.777 --> 45:25.727
You'd stay?

45:25.777 --> 45:27.777
Mm-hmm.
