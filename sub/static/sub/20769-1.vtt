01:35.554 --> 01:36.930
Yes, we received your payment.

01:38.015 --> 01:44.146
No, it wasn't late, but it was for $78.13,
and the bill was for $78.31.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.816
Okay, great.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.738
No, thank you.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.203
I think it's the intake manifold.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.333
- Was I right?
- Not even close.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.463
I think I just like saying
"intake manifold."

02:51.546 --> 02:54.174
Maybe when I get a job,
I'll get Triple A.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.134
I thought you worked
at the water company.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.218
Temping.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.723
- How's your parents?
- They're doing okay.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.269
I should, um, get going,
actually, for dinner.

03:06.353 --> 03:10.315
But, um, we should make a plan.
I'll send you a text.

03:10.399 --> 03:14.069
Or we could do that now
since we're both here.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.030
- What?
- Nothing.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.573
Okay.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.247
<i>Nice of Mercer.</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
I always thought you two
would make a good...

03:27.374 --> 03:29.626
- Mom.
- Couple.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.297
Boy from the neighborhood?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.632
That would've been cute.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.720
Remember when he fixed the roof?

03:39.803 --> 03:41.763
Stop.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.015
- He's not...
- I know, I know.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.316
Mm.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.404
Any word on the insurance?

03:57.487 --> 04:02.492
Oh, they won't cover the cost of IGIV.
It's $40,000.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.036
So, you know, surprise, surprise.
It's not on their list.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.913
Oh, enough of all that.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.332
Come on, honey.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.253
- Help me up.
- Okay.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.964
Here. You got it?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.341
Thanks, Mae.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.425
- Okay?
- Yeah.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.970
That's it.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.265
Well, not so fast.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.231
Okay and turn... just...

04:35.150 --> 04:37.819
- Ready?
- Yeah. I'm good.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.987
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.122
- <i>What are you doing right now?</i>
- I'm at work.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.626
I come here each day and in return,
I receive money to buy goods and services.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.589
<i>Ah, well, I've got to be quick.
I'm in Germany.</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:56.314
- Why are you in Germany?
- <i>Regulatory mess.</i>

04:56.338 --> 04:59.841
<i>Those guys did not screw around,
but listen, I got you an interview.</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:01.802
- What?
<i>- I got you an interview tomorrow.</i>

05:01.885 --> 05:05.013
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

05:06.056 --> 05:07.057
Really? No.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.977
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
I did, tomorrow.</i>

05:11.061 --> 05:13.146
Holy shit, Annie, I love you.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.150
<i>Remember,
it's just customer experience.</i>

05:15.232 --> 05:17.210
<i>So answer phones, help people,
what you're already doing</i>

05:17.234 --> 05:18.360
<i>but now a real company.</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:19.820
I know, it's perfect.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.571
<i>Tons of people started there.</i>

05:21.655 --> 05:23.532
I know, I know. Thank you.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.243
<i>Stop saying that.
We're hiring a hundred people this month.</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:29.204
<i>- One of them may as well be you.</i>
- Right, good.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.790
<i>This doesn't mean you're in.
You have to kill the interview.</i>

05:31.873 --> 05:33.875
<i>Know the Circle inside out.
I'm back next week.</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:36.545
<i>By then, you'll be hired
if you kill the interview.</i>

05:36.628 --> 05:37.921
Okay, I will.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.714
<i>You can do it, Mae. Own it!</i>

05:52.936 --> 05:56.940
How would you describe
what the Circle is to say,

05:57.023 --> 05:59.484
- your grandmother?
- Take True You, for example.

06:00.652 --> 06:05.407
It combined everything that was separate
and sloppy into one account.

06:05.490 --> 06:10.120
No more forgetting your password,
multiple identities, identity theft.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.415
You use your real name,
which is tied to your credit card.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.858
I think Grandma's falling asleep.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.671
Okay.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.386
Before True You, it was like
you needed a different vehicle

06:26.469 --> 06:28.263
for every single one of your errands,

06:28.346 --> 06:30.348
and no one should have to own
87 different cars.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.017
It doesn't make sense.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.146
It's the chaos of the Web
made elegant and simple.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.690
Speed round. Paul or John?

06:38.773 --> 06:39.773
Early Paul, late John.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.236
- Mario or Sonic?
- Early Sonic, late Mario.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.030
Introspection or communication?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.199
- Uh...
- Mae.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.910
- Sorry, I'm thinking about it.
- So that's introspection.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.912
- Sushi or Soylent?
- Sushi.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.122
Ever owned a Velcro wallet?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.334
- Yes.
- Velcro shoes?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.961
- Yes.
- Velcro... pants?

07:00.045 --> 07:01.296
Yes.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.150
What was the name of the receptionist
who checked you in this morning?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.175
Um...

07:10.555 --> 07:12.849
- Linda.
- Joan Baez or Joan Crawford?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.392
- Joan Didion.
- "Gif" or "jif"?

07:14.476 --> 07:17.479
I'm not answering that.
There's too much at stake.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.230
Would you like to go out with me?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.860
That's very inappropriate.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.947
Good. Quality or convenience?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.698
Not mutually exclusive.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.867
Needs of the society
or needs of the individual?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.036
- Should be the same.
- You're most scared of?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.165
Unfulfilled potential.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.644
All right, heliport, gym, daycare,

07:57.727 --> 07:59.980
- organic farm, pétanque.
- Pétanque?

08:00.063 --> 08:02.774
- Oh, it's like bocce but French.
- Oh.

08:02.857 --> 08:06.027
Tetherball, lap pool, social pool, doga.

08:09.739 --> 08:14.119
Kennel, nightclub, salon, maker space,

08:14.202 --> 08:18.081
rock climbing, trampoline,
clinic, volleyball.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.457
Was that...? Was that the...?

08:19.541 --> 08:22.627
Content people, news,
arts, film, engineers,

08:22.711 --> 08:25.755
management and me, advertising and you.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.218
All right, let's go.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.638
Your legs are so long.

08:39.811 --> 08:40.645
What?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.981
It's all on sensors.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.858
The elevator reads your ID
and says "hello."

08:44.941 --> 08:48.820
We do that for visitors mostly.
They're usually impressed.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.464
Annie, that's the worst picture
of me ever.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.907
Oh, come on... Oh. Oh, dear.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.492
- Danny!
- What's up?

08:54.576 --> 08:55.928
You remember Dan? I'm handing you off.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.370
- You're all grown-up.
- Oh.

08:57.454 --> 09:01.166
I have the privilege and the honor
to give you your brand new tablet, Mae.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.768
And I sent the password to your phone.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.586
- Oh, my God. It has my name on it.
- Uh-huh.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.838
Oh, this is too sad.
You take care of my little girl.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.757
I will.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.384
If we don't give customers
a human and humane experience,

09:11.468 --> 09:13.803
we have no customers,
it's pretty elemental.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.239
Jared will be doing your training.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.892
I oversee the team,
and Jared oversees the unit.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.686
As you know, you'll be doing
straight-up customer maintenance

09:21.770 --> 09:23.480
for the smaller advertisers.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.565
You work on your portable here.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.368
They send a message
to customer experience,

09:27.442 --> 09:29.861
and it gets routed over to one of you.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.447
Random at first, but once
you start working with a customer,

09:32.530 --> 09:35.658
they'll continue to be routed over to you
for the sake of continuity.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.786
Um, you get the query,
figure out the answer,

09:37.869 --> 09:41.081
you write them back,
and that is the core of it.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.124
Simple enough in theory. So far so good?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
- Uh, yeah.
- Cool.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.754
So let's say you've answered
a client's question,

09:47.837 --> 09:49.005
and they seem satisfied.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.650
Now, it's not just that you get a smile
or a frown, though that is part of it.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.135
You get your smile...
it's almost always a smile.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.721
Um, that is when you send the survey.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.225
The survey is a set of quick questions
about, you know, your overall service,

10:00.308 --> 10:03.478
how you did,
and they send that immediately back,

10:03.561 --> 10:06.707
and you get to see how you did right here.
That is the rating. Uh, you know what?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.024
Let's just do a live one.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.735
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.488
Okay.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.824
Have a nice day.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.495
That's pretty good, 99 is good,

10:20.578 --> 10:24.582
but I can't help wondering
why it wasn't 100. Let's look.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.418
Okay.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.697
Boom. Sometimes you just encounter someone
who isn't really sensitive to the metrics.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.513
So it's important to ask them
and make sure you get that clarity.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.183
And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.227
Oh, wow.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.521
All right, are you ready to do this
on your own?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.814
- Yes.
- Awesome.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.463
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.448
Hey, how's it going?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.259
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.
- Oh, just for a day.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.802
Then London, then New York, now here.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.037
- Have you slept?
- A few hours on the plane.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.414
A couple pills, I'm good.
So you? First week.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.541
What?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.709
You got an 87 average.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.086
- That's like a solid B.
- How long till I'm fired?

11:52.170 --> 11:54.189
Listen, when I first started,
it took me a few weeks

11:54.213 --> 11:55.774
to really get the hang of it.
Believe me, okay?

11:55.798 --> 11:58.009
Believe me, you're doing fine.
You're good, all right?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.093
Mm-hm.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.261
Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.849
Hey.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.689
Thank you, thank you.
So glad to see you all here.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.276
Now a bunch of you are new
to the company since I last spoke,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.487
so can the guppies all stand up?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.740
- Right, that's you.
- Come on, guppies, just stand up.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.263
- Whoo!
- Guppies, stand up, come on.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
Congratulations, nice to have you.

12:25.203 --> 12:29.916
Now "guppies" is just an affectionate term
for you baby fishies.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.835
Soon you will all grow
to become powerful...

12:32.919 --> 12:35.338
- You're adorable.
- I hate you.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.383
...the fish that guppies grow up
into being...

12:38.466 --> 12:40.593
What do they grow up into?

12:40.677 --> 12:42.637
Anyway, all right, this is Dream Friday,

12:42.720 --> 12:46.516
the latest in our long tradition
of presenting our newest innovations.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.602
The first Dream Friday
featured Ty Lafitte,

12:49.686 --> 12:52.230
the inventor of True You
and our founding father.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.733
And usually, we feature one
of our engineers or our visionaries

12:55.817 --> 12:58.403
but today unfortunately,
it's just me and for that,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.071
I apologize in advance.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.924
We love you, Eamon!

13:01.948 --> 13:03.116
Thanks, Mom.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.137
Now you might not have seen me
around campus

13:07.161 --> 13:08.722
for the last few days,
and maybe you were wondering

13:08.746 --> 13:10.206
just where the heck I've been.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.416
Surfing!

13:11.499 --> 13:13.251
Argh!

13:13.334 --> 13:16.713
You got me! Yes, I've been surfing.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.132
And that's part
of what I'm here to talk about.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.551
I love to surf and in the past,

13:21.634 --> 13:26.305
I would have to wake up
and call the local surf shop

13:26.389 --> 13:29.559
to ask about the local breaks,
and pretty soon,

13:29.642 --> 13:32.854
the local surf shop
stopped answering their phone.

13:32.937 --> 13:37.108
And then I got a cell phone,

13:37.191 --> 13:39.861
and I could call up my buddies
who were already out

13:39.944 --> 13:42.113
at the beach before me,
and I could ask them,

13:42.196 --> 13:45.533
but they, too,
stopped answering their phones.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.036
And then came...

13:49.078 --> 13:50.079
the Internet.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.082
Whoa. Oh!

13:53.166 --> 13:57.086
Some geniuses set up cameras
on the beaches,

13:57.170 --> 14:00.757
so I could log on
and get some very crude images

14:00.840 --> 14:02.842
of the waves at Stinson Beach.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.637
It was almost worse
than calling the surf shop.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.514
Here's how it used to look.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.268
Almost useless, right?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.562
But now let's refresh that page

14:14.645 --> 14:18.691
and show the site
with our new Circle video delivery.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.737
Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.822
Yeah, maybe I should be
out there right now.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.241
But would it surprise you to know

14:27.325 --> 14:31.621
that this is not coming
from some big camera

14:31.704 --> 14:34.791
but actually just one of these?

14:36.167 --> 14:39.796
This camera needs no wires.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.591
It transmits this image via satellite.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.843
I set up that camera this morning.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.722
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes
with no permit, nothing,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.974
in fact, no one even knows it's there.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.976
And actually,
I was pretty busy this morning

14:54.060 --> 14:58.648
because here's Rodeo Beach,
Montera,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.942
Ocean Beach,

15:01.025 --> 15:02.527
Fort Point.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.694
This is my front yard.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.281
And here's my backyard.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.533
Here's traffic on the 101.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.743
Oh, did you think this was just a camera?

15:10.827 --> 15:13.996
No, welcome
to real time analytic processing.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.750
When you see this,
you're also getting this.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.881
Air quality, traffic volume,
weather patterns, biometrics,

15:23.965 --> 15:28.970
facial recognition, saved and searchable,
all to serve you better.

15:29.053 --> 15:34.183
My friends, we are looking
at retailing these in just a few months

15:34.267 --> 15:36.686
for less than a pair of jeans.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.814
And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.692
I'm talking about the ones
like I'm wearing.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.818
Wow!

15:43.901 --> 15:48.698
Now, Circlers... do you like to share?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.491
Sharing is caring!

15:50.575 --> 15:53.411
Sharing is caring.
I thought you might say that.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.972
- Sharing is caring?
- Sharing is caring.

15:54.996 --> 16:00.209
I have a dozen helpers all over the world
right now carrying these cameras.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.087
Imagine the human rights implications.

16:03.171 --> 16:07.467
Activists no longer have
to hold up a camera.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.470
Now it's as easy as
gluing a camera to a wall,

16:10.553 --> 16:13.139
and actually, we've done just that.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.975
Do you see any cameras here?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.144
No.

16:18.227 --> 16:23.691
We have 144 cameras in place here,
and it took us just a day to do it,

16:23.774 --> 16:25.109
and they're virtually invisible.

16:25.193 --> 16:29.113
They come in every color,
so camouflaging is a cinch.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.365
This is my favorite. Whoa!

16:31.449 --> 16:33.659
Nice catch.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.036
Sign her up.

16:35.119 --> 16:39.916
So now, the entire world is watching.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.584
You know, I agree with the Hague,

16:41.667 --> 16:44.378
with the human rights activists
all over the world.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.422
There needs to be accountability.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.301
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.

16:50.384 --> 16:55.348
We will see them. We will hear them.
We will hear and see everything.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.850
If it happens, we'll know.

16:59.477 --> 17:03.147
We're calling it... SeeChange.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.609
SeeChange.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.365
Oh, we'll know the good things, too.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.242
- Aw.
- Aw.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.578
We will see it all.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.790
Because knowing is good.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.376
But knowing everything is better.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.219
Whoo! Yeah!

17:42.103 --> 17:44.939
Good thing you guys like
to keep things modest.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.357
What's this party even for?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.151
SeeChange. Summer solstice.
Everything. Nothing.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.696
Come on, let's be the only ones
who know how to dance!

17:51.779 --> 17:54.240
My God, is that Beck?

17:57.618 --> 18:01.706
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:05.042
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

18:06.210 --> 18:10.089
<i>♪ Come on out of your dreams ♪</i>

18:10.172 --> 18:12.800
<i>♪ And wake up from your rêverie ♪</i>

18:14.635 --> 18:18.347
<i>♪ Time is here, don't go to sleep ♪</i>

18:18.431 --> 18:21.100
<i>♪ Streets are running on the brink ♪</i>

18:22.351 --> 18:24.854
So Bailey, what's he actually like?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.355
You're in the gang of 40.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.750
Yeah, but I don't get a ton
of alone time with him.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.086
I mean, you know,
a lot of people work in the White House.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.362
How many people really get
to know the President?

18:33.446 --> 18:36.490
Oh, actually,
do you wanna see something?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.618
Oh, my God. You need to see this.
Follow me.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.662
<i>♪ Here we are ♪</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:46.417
Here. This is it.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.299
Nice knocker.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.594
Holy shit, right?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.639
Right?

18:59.722 --> 19:02.558
I think all of these have gotta
be first editions?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.561
Oh, but, um, you have to give me a verbal
nondisclosure agreement, okay?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.104
- Annie.
- Seriously.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.941
You shouldn't be here and probably
won't ever be here again, so verbal NDA.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.364
- I promise not to disclose anything.
- Good.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.492
This is where Bailey and Stenton
make all of their plans.

19:19.575 --> 19:24.121
It's very serious.
I mean, this is high nerd, right?

19:24.205 --> 19:25.925
Oh, no, you probably shouldn't play with...

19:28.167 --> 19:32.171
- Like this?
- You're such a dork.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.255
Well...

19:34.382 --> 19:37.927
- So this is where it all happens.
- To be a fly on the wall, right?

19:39.345 --> 19:40.846
We should get back to the party.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.349
Well, you should at least.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.812
- You're not coming back?
- I've got work.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.457
- Annie, it's like, 11 o'clock.
- I've got Australia in a few minutes.

19:50.481 --> 19:53.317
Ah. A-ha. Actually, a few minutes ago,
but you have fun, okay?

19:53.401 --> 19:55.695
- Annie...
- You're gonna have so much fun.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.112
- You guys are gonna love this.
- Okay.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.454
Whoops.

20:17.758 --> 20:21.429
So I heard there's a party around here.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.848
You know, if that's, like...

20:23.931 --> 20:25.641
your kind of thing.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.184
Yeah, maybe I'll check it out.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.031
It's probably not as interesting
as whatever's on your phone, though.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.235
Okay, probably not.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.661
- Do you want a drink?
- I do, but they ran out like an hour ago.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.164
I think they did too, but shh.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.336
Are you serious? Whoa.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.715
- You have glasses in there, too?
- It's my party trick.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.553
- Oh.
- All right.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.763
Thank you.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.393
You're new here.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.024
- You are, right?
- How can you tell that?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.507
- I don't know, I just guessed.
- That's really embarrassing.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.780
I'm sorry.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.740
What do you think?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.742
- Of this?
- Yeah.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.705
I'm excited.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.915
Mm-hm.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.795
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.397
It's just everyone
that works at the Circle

21:37.421 --> 21:40.382
is so excited to be here,

21:40.466 --> 21:44.345
and they just want to tell everyone
about it all the time. It's, you know...

21:44.428 --> 21:45.948
It's like, "Here, try this Kool-Aid!"

21:46.013 --> 21:47.866
- Oh, Kool-Aid?
- "It's delicious. You'll love it."

21:47.890 --> 21:49.558
- Oh, wow!
- I love Kool-Aid.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.435
Don't you love Kool-Aid?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.856
After my last job
where I just tried to, like,

21:55.940 --> 21:58.180
calm down angry people all day...

21:59.193 --> 22:01.195
I'm just grateful to be here.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.114
I got to go put out a fire.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.743
- Sounds exciting.
- Very. So, uh...

22:07.827 --> 22:08.828
I'll leave you to it.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.749
Have a drink, have a good time,
and stay excited.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.959
You're at the Circle.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.385
Did he tell me his name? I forgot it.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.598
- Have a good night, guppy.
- Oh! Thanks.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.601
<i>Last shuttle
will be leaving in five minutes.</i>

22:59.795 --> 23:03.591
I'm telling you Mae-Mae...
there's something about you.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.467
You have a glow.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.596
- You do.
- I do not have a glow.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.682
Like you're with child.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.517
Ignore him.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.477
So it's been great?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.605
I don't think I ever wanna work
anywhere else.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.482
I told, um, Carolina's mom.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.776
I might've let your salary slip.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.445
- Oh, Mom.
- What?

23:24.528 --> 23:28.532
It's been fun to casually
insert it into conversation.

23:28.616 --> 23:32.620
"My daughter works for the best company
on the planet!

23:32.703 --> 23:34.705
And has full dental."

23:34.788 --> 23:37.082
Please don't. I just got lucky.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.627
- If it wasn't for Annie...
- Annie, how is Annie?

23:40.753 --> 23:41.754
She's good.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.507
- Working too hard.
- What does she do exactly?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.844
She's in the gang of 40.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.929
Uh-huh.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.556
She's in on all the big decisions,

23:54.058 --> 23:56.352
deals with regulatory issues
in other countries.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.313
That sounds important.

24:00.939 --> 24:05.486
Mae, hon, why don't you get your daddy
another beer?

24:05.569 --> 24:06.570
Sure, Dad.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.254
Your hair.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.298
It was a phase.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.092
It was a cute phase.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.095
You good?

24:31.178 --> 24:32.971
I'm good.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.015
You should come visit me at work sometime.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.099
At the Circle?

24:37.017 --> 24:38.727
I'll give that idea a smile.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.270
Hey...

24:40.354 --> 24:42.981
They might think I was there
to clean the toilets.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.818
Come on. They'd love you.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.463
All those tech guys secretly wish
they knew how to use a hand saw,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.364
make something out of wood.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.533
That really sums me up pretty well.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.953
- It could be worse, I guess.
- You know what I mean.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.497
They want you to tell them
about your secret hiking spots.

24:58.580 --> 25:02.084
So they could put them on True You
and ruin it forever?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.920
Ooh, biting commentary.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.964
I mean, come on,
you have to admit, like,

25:07.047 --> 25:10.467
smiles and frowns
used to be for middle school.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.832
Like, "Hey, you know,
do you like stickers and unicorns?"

25:12.886 --> 25:15.723
"Yes, I love stickers and unicorns."
Smile, you know.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.891
And now... now it's everyone.

25:17.975 --> 25:21.854
I can't help it if you're not... social.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.941
I am social enough.
I mean, isn't... this socializing?

25:27.484 --> 25:31.739
I assume you've heard about that senator
that's trying to, like, break you guys up

25:31.822 --> 25:34.450
- citing antitrust laws, right?
- Give me a break, Mercer.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.910
Don't you have to go
and chop some wood or something?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.542
- Thanks, hon.
- Sure, Dad.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.337
His business is doing well.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.841
Mercer? The antler chandeliers?

25:50.924 --> 25:53.302
They are beautiful, Mae.
He's making one for us.

25:53.385 --> 25:57.514
Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?
They say that's pretty good for a guppy.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.684
Who's a guppy?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.478
Well, that's great, Mae.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.441
- Honey?
- Hm?

26:07.524 --> 26:10.360
Oh. Come on,
we'll go in the house, come on.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.321
Dad? Don't worry.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.257
- What happened?
- Please, Mae, let your mother.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.282
Honey, just, just...

26:15.365 --> 26:17.051
Just tell everybody
that Dad's not feeling well,

26:17.075 --> 26:19.953
and they'll understand, really.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.164
It's okay.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.749
Dad.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.793
Please, Mae.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.170
We got it.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.380
It's okay.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.342
Come on.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.389
Thanks.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.438
See you soon, Mae.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.732
Bye.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.508
<i>Today, I call upon
the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee</i>

27:56.592 --> 27:58.385
<i>to investigate the Circle.</i>

27:58.468 --> 28:02.723
<i>We cannot rely on them to say,
"We're not violating antitrust laws."</i>

28:02.806 --> 28:05.976
<i>I'm sure the Circle
will be glad to cooperate.</i>

28:06.059 --> 28:09.897
<i>We have every confidence
that Senator Williamson's allegations</i>

28:09.980 --> 28:10.981
<i>will be discredited.</i>

28:11.064 --> 28:13.442
You are probably wondering
about your new screen.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.277
Hi, I'm Gina.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.653
- I'm Matt.
- Hi.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.698
Dan said this would be a good moment
to set up all your socials.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.199
- Do you have time?
- Sure.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.284
Great.

28:22.367 --> 28:26.705
I take it last week you were too busy
to set up your company social account,

28:26.788 --> 28:29.124
and I don't think
you've imported your old profile.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.418
Sorry, I've just been
kind of overwhelmed so far.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.295
- Oh.
- No, in a good way.

28:33.378 --> 28:37.215
I just haven't had time yet
for extracurricular stuff.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.717
Wow.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.886
That's so interesting you put it that way.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.931
We actually see your profile
and the activity on it

28:44.014 --> 28:48.101
as integral to your participation here.
This is how your coworkers,

28:48.185 --> 28:51.647
even the ones on the other side of campus,
know who you are.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.067
Communication certainly
isn't extracurricular, right?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.985
Right. Of course.

28:57.069 --> 29:01.448
We consider you a full knowable person
of unlimited potential

29:01.531 --> 29:03.659
and a crucial member of the community.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.370
But you're such an enigma.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.454
I am?

29:07.537 --> 29:11.208
It's been years since someone
so shrouded in mystery started here.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.919
- Everyone really likes you.
- Your work's been exemplary.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.129
Strong ratings for your first week.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.548
Are you satisfied with your performance?

29:18.632 --> 29:21.134
Uh, I think I can do better.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.887
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?

29:23.971 --> 29:26.932
- It's all also about community.
- Of course.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.434
It's all connected.

29:30.435 --> 29:34.189
But you've had a blip or two when it comes
to meshing with the community,

29:34.273 --> 29:37.651
like your absence at several weekend
or evening events.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.070
Which are, of course, optional.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.173
- I'm sorry?
- Let's start with this weekend.

29:42.197 --> 29:48.495
You left campus at 11:42 p.m. on Friday
and got back 8:46 a.m., Monday.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.080
Was there work on the weekend?

29:50.163 --> 29:51.707
- Oh, no, no!
- I didn't... I'm sorry.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.624
Oh, so sweet.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.428
There wasn't mandatory work
on the weekend.

29:54.459 --> 29:58.046
This isn't like a clock in,
clock out type place, thank God!

29:58.130 --> 29:59.941
But, you know,
there were thousands of people here

29:59.965 --> 30:01.859
participating in a hundred
different activities.

30:01.883 --> 30:02.883
So many.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.055
I'm sorry, I, um...

30:07.139 --> 30:11.101
My dad had an... an episode,
and I was home helping out with that.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.854
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is that related to his MS?

30:15.564 --> 30:18.275
Uh... yeah.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.118
We didn't know anything
about this incident.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.487
Did you reach out to any Circlers
during this crisis?

30:22.571 --> 30:26.783
- Annie? Anybody?
- Uh, no. I... No.

30:26.867 --> 30:30.912
Mae, there are four groups here
for staffers dealing with MS,

30:30.996 --> 30:33.081
two of them for children of MS patients.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.417
Have you sought out a group?

30:35.500 --> 30:38.045
- I didn't know.
- Okay.

30:38.128 --> 30:42.215
Can you... talk about what you did
the rest of the weekend?

30:42.299 --> 30:44.885
Nothing, really. I just... I kayaked.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.138
You kayaked? With who?

30:48.221 --> 30:50.807
Nobody. Just on my own.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.392
I kayak.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.703
We could have kayaked together.

30:53.727 --> 30:58.774
Nothing on your profile about kayaking,
no smiles, no ratings, no posts.

30:58.857 --> 31:03.278
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior
sometimes stems from low self-worth.

31:03.362 --> 31:07.866
This is what participation is all about,
bringing you, lifting you up.

31:07.949 --> 31:11.203
Thus, your participation window.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.790
I can't believe you've been here this long
without being on the main social feed.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.000
You're about to have your world rocked.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.045
See, these are all
of last week's messages.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.755
That's why there's so many.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.841
- Eight thousand?
- Mm-hm.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.345
Looks like you have a lot
of catching up to do here. A feast!

31:28.428 --> 31:29.971
Have fun.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.308
Oh, forgot one more thing.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.229
This is your participation rank.
Party rank for short.

31:37.312 --> 31:41.358
Some people here call it the
popularity rank, but it's not really that.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.360
It's just an algorithm-generated number

31:43.443 --> 31:46.363
that takes into account
all your activity in the inner circle.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.446
That makes sense?

31:48.365 --> 31:51.910
- I think so.
- Okay. And again, it's just for fun.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.954
- It's just for fun!
- Okay, bye.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.668
Um, I think
it's for Tuesday next week?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.420
Is that in Building 74 or...?

32:01.503 --> 32:03.743
- Uh, no. It's actually off campus.
- Okay.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.087
<i>It's been a month.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:47.883
<i>When are you coming home?
We miss you.</i>

32:47.966 --> 32:49.676
I can't. You know.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.637
<i>How's the dorm?
Do you have to clean your own room?</i>

32:52.721 --> 32:55.015
- We have people that do that.
- <i>Ooh, thank God.</i>

32:55.098 --> 32:57.184
How's Dad?

32:57.267 --> 33:00.228
<i>He's okay. He... he fell yesterday.</i>

33:00.312 --> 33:03.815
<i>And I couldn't lift him up,
but thank God Mercer came by.</i>

33:03.899 --> 33:05.108
<i>He's stronger than I thought.</i>

33:06.818 --> 33:07.819
I'm sorry.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.030
I should have been there.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.581
Is that one of his?

33:20.582 --> 33:24.419
<i>- Yeah. I think it's his best work.</i>
- It's awesome.

33:26.755 --> 33:30.050
I gotta go, Mom. I love you.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.219
<i>- Okay, well, bye. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.821
I'm so sorry about last week.
I've been up my own ass.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.758
And I didn't mean
to be a shitty friend.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.243
It's okay. Where are we going?

33:56.326 --> 33:58.787
Listen, I've been looking
into your parents' situation,

33:58.870 --> 34:01.831
and I think... I have an idea.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.750
All right? Yeah?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.001
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:05.085 --> 34:08.880
- This is Jessica. This is Mae.
- Hello, Mae, how are you?

34:08.964 --> 34:11.507
I understand you haven't done
your medical intake yet.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.842
- No.
- Can you drink this for me?

34:19.014 --> 34:20.308
All of it, if you can.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.942
- I told you about Mae's dad's...
- Mm-hm, multiple sclerosis.

34:29.025 --> 34:32.070
I did my post doc on MS.
Love to get some real time data.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.406
Here you go.

34:35.447 --> 34:36.447
Okay.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.411
- How does this feel?
- Warm.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.791
Is this for free?

34:44.873 --> 34:46.710
Of course. You get to keep it.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.628
So, it's going to feel warm
for a few days,

34:48.712 --> 34:51.005
then you and the media band
will get used to each other,

34:51.089 --> 34:54.092
but it has to touch the skin to work.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.844
Waterproof. No need to take it off.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.555
Let's activate it, shall we?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.266
Is that the...?

35:01.349 --> 35:04.769
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor
you ingested a second ago.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.941
And now...

35:10.025 --> 35:12.265
Let's have you walk around the room.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.531
Briskly.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.662
It'll collect data on your heart rate,
blood pressure, cholesterol,

35:22.746 --> 35:28.460
sleep duration, sleep quality,
digestive efficiency, on and on.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.338
And all that data is stored
in the Cloud and in your tablet,

35:31.421 --> 35:34.924
anywhere you want, and of course, it's all
collated with the rest of the Circle.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.612
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see

35:37.636 --> 35:40.263
and the problems we can avoid
when we have all that data.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.742
Speaking of which, I was thinking
it would make sense for...

35:42.766 --> 35:45.477
Mae's folks to come
on the Circle health plan.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.187
Uh, wait, what?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.749
Wouldn't be the first time,
and I'd really like to get

35:49.773 --> 35:50.982
real time data from your dad.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.400
Sit back down.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.194
Can you get in touch with HR,

35:54.277 --> 35:55.421
- clear it with them?
- Yep.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.155
- Tell them I say it's a go.
- Absolutely.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.409
We'll send someone out
to set them up, okay?

36:03.536 --> 36:05.622
<i>Honey, this is gonna
save our lives.</i>

36:05.705 --> 36:09.292
<i>- Thank you. And thank Annie too.</i>
- They thank you.

36:09.376 --> 36:10.877
Aw.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.380
<i>This is amazing. Call you later, okay?</i>

36:13.463 --> 36:16.299
Okay. I gotta go.
Big event here on campus.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.550
<i>- Exciting.</i>
- I know.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.427
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.888
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye.

36:23.348 --> 36:26.935
- Thank you.
- Oh. You're welcome.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.022
All right. You okay?

36:31.106 --> 36:33.316
Okay. Come on.

36:40.532 --> 36:44.911
Openness is something
we advocate here at the Circle.

36:45.954 --> 36:46.955
We live it.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.792
We demonstrate our commitment
to openness every day.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.547
Our government, not so much.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.426
We expect openness,
and we get obfuscation.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.302
We get doublespeak.

37:01.386 --> 37:06.850
No wonder Congress' approval rating
is currently at 11 percent.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.646
Now, I'm sure a lot of you
have heard about a certain senator

37:11.730 --> 37:17.819
who it was revealed has been involved
in some... very unsavory business.

37:18.862 --> 37:23.241
What are we to learn from this?
We need accountability.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.410
We need openness.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.080
We need to know
what the people who represent us

37:29.164 --> 37:32.792
are doing with their time on our dime.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.713
To serve us better.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.381
Well, I'm happy to report

37:38.465 --> 37:43.678
that there's a woman
who is taking all of this very seriously

37:43.762 --> 37:48.767
and is taking some pretty dramatic steps
to address the problem.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.770
So please join me in welcoming

37:51.853 --> 37:55.523
Olivia Santos,
Congresswoman for District 14.

37:59.986 --> 38:01.106
That's right, Tom.

38:02.071 --> 38:06.075
I am as concerned as you are
about the need for citizens to know

38:06.159 --> 38:09.162
what their elected leaders are doing.

38:09.245 --> 38:15.293
So I intend to show exactly
how democracy can and should be.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.635
Starting today, my every meeting,

38:23.718 --> 38:28.431
my every phone call
and e-mail will be accessible

38:28.515 --> 38:32.185
to my constituents and to the world.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.899
In real time!

38:37.982 --> 38:43.613
It will all be on my True You page.
That's right. Thank you, thank you.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.950
Goodbye, backroom deals.
Goodbye, shady lobbyists.

38:47.033 --> 38:51.538
Hello, democracy. Open and accountable!

38:51.621 --> 38:53.206
That's right. That's a fact!

38:54.916 --> 38:58.253
- Where do you work?
- I work in customer experience.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.548
I started in CE, too. A lot of us did.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.550
Cool. Where do you work now?

39:03.633 --> 39:06.469
Biometrics, iris scanning,
facial recognition.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.222
Right now, I'm working on Child Track.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.225
The program protects children
from predators.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.186
The second a kid isn't where
they're supposed to be, an alert goes off

39:15.270 --> 39:17.772
and the kid can be tracked down
within 90 seconds.

39:17.856 --> 39:22.068
- Wow. Do they wear a bracelet or...?
- We place chips in the bone.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.407
Uh, you're...

39:29.909 --> 39:31.327
You're serious?

39:31.411 --> 39:35.582
I'm serious about immediately reducing
kidnapping, rape, and murder

39:35.665 --> 39:37.166
by 99 percent.

39:40.587 --> 39:41.856
I think I'm going to get a drink.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.339
- But...
- Oh.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.884
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.100
- Hey.
- Hey, check your e-mail

39:54.183 --> 39:57.645
- 'cause I sent you an invite.
- Awesome. Thank you. All right.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.772
- Yeah, good to see you.
- You too.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.524
- Hi, Mae! How's it going?
- Hey.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.192
- You having fun?
- Yeah, you?

40:03.276 --> 40:04.277
Yeah.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.020
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.944
So, what did you think
about the whole presentation?

40:46.027 --> 40:47.654
- The Santos thing?
- Yeah.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.784
It's exciting. It's a...

40:52.867 --> 40:56.579
- Momentous moment in the history of...
- Okay, what did you really think?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.920
I thought it was a bit much.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.523
Just a little bit.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.092
So where does all the data go?

41:09.175 --> 41:12.512
Is it stored somewhere? In the Cloud?

41:13.554 --> 41:15.014
There's a physical place, too.

41:18.685 --> 41:19.978
Do you wanna see something?

41:42.166 --> 41:46.087
So you're gonna have to leave
your stuff outside before you go in.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.548
Just because you're not
supposed to... you know.

41:53.970 --> 41:58.975
So I'm just going to have to take... this.
And this.

42:11.654 --> 42:12.798
I want to thank you already for this.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.908
I love following strangers
down dark corridors.

42:15.992 --> 42:19.287
- This is the best.
- Almost there.

42:25.585 --> 42:30.214
This holds Congresswoman Santos,
every second of her from now on.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.634
And this will be the next one.

42:35.511 --> 42:38.431
- Just these?
- Oh, no. There's more.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.269
What is this?

42:43.352 --> 42:46.606
Well, it was supposed to be a part
of a subway but they abandoned it.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.443
- Where does it go?
- It connects to the bay.

42:50.526 --> 42:54.614
But I've traveled about a half a mile
into it, gets too wet.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.495
And that's where the rest of it will be.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.540
- The rest of what?
- The rest of it all.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.086
Santos is just the start.

43:09.212 --> 43:12.465
The plan is everything recorded,
seen, broadcast,

43:12.548 --> 43:16.552
all of it stored, analyzed,
available to the Circle in any way.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.579
You did your health intake, right?

43:20.807 --> 43:22.391
- Yeah.
- See, right? Look.

43:22.475 --> 43:25.853
Every step, every breath,
all of it stored.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.232
They can use it however they see fit.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.858
We're being studied.

43:30.942 --> 43:34.487
Everyone's data in the Circle
is being studied, monetized.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.030
It is voluntary.

43:37.198 --> 43:40.493
And isn't that the whole point?
Having everything in one place?

43:42.161 --> 43:44.247
I mean, that's True You.

43:44.330 --> 43:47.959
That's not why I invented True You.
Not even close.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.794
Ty Lafitte invented True You.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.964
Yeah.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.047
I'm Ty.

43:56.050 --> 43:57.260
No, you're not.

43:57.343 --> 44:00.012
Ty Lafitte has been off the grid
for years.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.643
Oh, my God.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.726
I'm Ty.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.480
Why the low profile?

44:09.564 --> 44:12.358
I just wanted to move through
this world like a normal person.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.944
I didn't wanna be watched every second.

44:15.027 --> 44:17.196
But I do spend a lot of time here.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.408
It's easier. I don't have to deal
with Stenton and Bailey.

44:20.491 --> 44:24.745
Not that I'm privy to their conversations
in their little sanctum.

44:24.829 --> 44:29.208
Holy shit. I'm in a cave with Ty Lafitte.

44:29.292 --> 44:35.423
Wait, hold on. So when we met,
you didn't know who I was?

44:35.506 --> 44:38.259
You never told me your name.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.386
And after a while,
it was just weird to ask.

44:42.180 --> 44:46.517
I knew I could trust you when I met you.
I don't know, I just thought to myself,

44:46.601 --> 44:48.801
this girl, she doesn't have
a cynical bone in her body.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.480
Reminds me of how I used to be.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.151
Listen, you can't tell anyone
that you were here.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.474
Okay? That I brought you here.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.487
Okay.

44:58.571 --> 45:02.909
Things at the Circle,
they need to change.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.202
Like what? Connecting the world?

45:06.495 --> 45:08.331
Insuring my parents?

45:08.414 --> 45:11.000
You should be really proud
of what you created.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.085
Look, proud? Proud of what?

45:13.169 --> 45:16.380
The disregard for privacy,
the use of personal data

45:16.464 --> 45:18.925
for the accumulation of wealth
and control?

45:19.008 --> 45:20.927
I'm not proud.
This is not what I created.

45:21.010 --> 45:22.988
Do you think Senator Williamson
being investigated

45:23.012 --> 45:25.097
by the FBI is just a coincidence?

45:25.181 --> 45:27.075
We can't be seen together,
and you have to promise me.

45:27.099 --> 45:28.899
You can't tell anyone
that we were down here.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.241
Hello?

45:44.325 --> 45:46.494
<i>Mae, you have a visitor here
to see you.</i>

45:46.577 --> 45:47.745
In the lobby?

45:53.834 --> 45:55.586
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.714
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm really not okay.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.968
Why didn't you call, send a text?

46:02.051 --> 46:05.513
Because I wanted to see you in person.
I wanted to look you in the eyes.

46:07.056 --> 46:08.140
Okay.

46:08.224 --> 46:13.980
- Um, I'll sign you in.
- No, just wait, I...

46:14.063 --> 46:17.733
- The stuff you posted about my work.
- Your chandeliers?

46:17.817 --> 46:20.987
Yeah.
I know you meant well, but...

46:21.070 --> 46:23.489
What's the problem?
I thought I saw good stuff going up.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.491
They started calling me a deer killer.

46:26.492 --> 46:29.245
And then there's a campaign
to shut me down.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.747
I wasn't even online. I was working.

46:31.831 --> 46:34.625
And when I checked my e-mail,
there were death threats.

46:38.713 --> 46:39.755
I'm sorry.

46:39.839 --> 46:41.173
Death threats, Mae.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.092
Obviously, I never meant
for this to happen.

46:43.175 --> 46:45.469
But I... I can fix it.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.559
Mae.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.642
Mae.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.062
Will you listen to me?

46:56.355 --> 46:57.231
I can't do this.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.776
I can't be a part of this world
that you're creating.

47:00.860 --> 47:01.986
What are you talking about?

47:02.069 --> 47:04.155
Jesus Christ, look at these people!

47:04.238 --> 47:05.865
Does this really seem okay to you?

47:05.948 --> 47:07.676
Why don't you go
kill some more deer, Mercer?

47:07.700 --> 47:10.703
I never killed any deer.
I don't kill deer.

47:10.786 --> 47:14.248
Mercer, look, let's not do this here.

47:14.331 --> 47:15.875
Let's go upstairs.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.335
- I'll figure it out.
- Do you ever leave this place, Mae?

47:19.920 --> 47:23.674
We used to go on adventures
and have fun and see things,

47:23.758 --> 47:26.218
and you were brave and excited.

47:28.054 --> 47:30.347
And now it's all filtered through this.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.022
Bye.

50:44.500 --> 50:46.001
I can't believe I was so stupid.

50:48.003 --> 50:49.689
I'm so lucky that you guys
were around here.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.382
Luck? Hell.

50:51.465 --> 50:53.884
SeeChange cameras saved your life.

50:53.968 --> 50:55.427
A cop saw you go through the fence,

50:55.511 --> 50:57.888
and then we got a call
from someone watching the seals.

51:04.353 --> 51:05.938
So, Mae, how do you feel?

51:09.900 --> 51:10.900
Ashamed.

51:10.943 --> 51:13.654
I... I barely slept.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.365
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.
We all are.

51:17.408 --> 51:19.910
And everyone
who watched your adventure online.

51:19.994 --> 51:22.413
I hope your folks weren't too worried.

51:22.496 --> 51:23.539
They're doing okay.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.251
I understand
your father's condition has improved.

51:28.585 --> 51:29.837
Very much.

51:34.174 --> 51:35.175
Mr. Bailey...

51:36.176 --> 51:38.679
I want to say how much
I value my position here...

51:40.681 --> 51:42.349
and what you've done for my family.

51:42.433 --> 51:46.020
Mae, you're a valued part of the Circle,
and you're family.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.564
And we care about
everybody you care about.

51:49.732 --> 51:53.319
You know, this incident
has actually shown a lot of people

51:53.402 --> 51:54.611
the necessity for SeeChange.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.532
I'm so glad those cameras were there.

51:58.615 --> 52:00.093
I wish you would've known
there was a camera there

52:00.117 --> 52:02.369
before you swiped that kayak,
but...

52:04.997 --> 52:08.292
Mae, Tom and I want to talk you
about an idea, but before we do,

52:10.336 --> 52:12.046
is there anything you want to tell us?

52:16.717 --> 52:18.927
That I've been here before?

52:19.011 --> 52:22.097
It's only our lies that get us in trouble,
the things we hide.

52:23.682 --> 52:26.101
Of course I know you've
been in here before.

52:28.103 --> 52:30.856
And now that I know your secret,
do you feel better or worse?

52:35.569 --> 52:37.446
Better.

52:37.529 --> 52:38.655
Relieved, actually.

52:40.491 --> 52:43.952
I am a believer
in the perfectibility of human beings.

52:44.036 --> 52:47.664
When we are our best selves,
the possibilities are endless.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.792
There isn't a problem
that we cannot solve.

52:49.875 --> 52:53.629
We can cure any disease
and we can end hunger, and...

52:55.339 --> 52:59.927
Without secrets, without the hoarding
of knowledge and information,

53:00.010 --> 53:02.805
we can finally realize our potential.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.102
This is a special Dream Friday.

53:08.185 --> 53:13.399
I thought I'd change it up a bit today
and not have a speech but an interview.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.902
I had a conversation
with a young Circler the other day

53:16.985 --> 53:18.487
that I wanted to share with you.

53:19.488 --> 53:22.825
I've asked Mae Holland,
who some of you might know

53:22.908 --> 53:26.412
as one of our new guppies in customer
experience, to join me today.

53:26.495 --> 53:30.666
Mae's only been with us for a few months
but she has made quite an impression.

53:30.749 --> 53:33.085
Let's bring her out. Mae Holland!

53:43.554 --> 53:45.431
Well, hi, Mae, how are you?

53:45.514 --> 53:46.515
- Terrified.
- Mm.

53:46.598 --> 53:48.058
Don't be nervous.

53:48.142 --> 53:50.102
Easy for you to say.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.021
All right, Mae, we have all seen

53:53.105 --> 53:54.825
the SeeChange footage
from the other night,

53:54.898 --> 53:57.109
but please describe
what happened for us.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.112
I committed a crime.

54:01.363 --> 54:04.867
I borrowed a kayak
without the owner's knowledge,

54:04.950 --> 54:06.470
paddled out to the middle of the bay,

54:07.828 --> 54:10.497
and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.

54:10.581 --> 54:14.918
Well, I'm not sure
that's exactly a capital offense,

54:15.002 --> 54:17.129
but you did risk your own life.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.716
So, Mae, do you think
you behave better or worse

54:20.799 --> 54:23.635
- when you are being watched?
- Better.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.763
Without a doubt.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.600
And what happens when you're alone
and unobserved?

54:30.684 --> 54:32.561
Well, for starters, I steal kayaks.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.398
Jesus. She's a natural.

54:36.482 --> 54:40.611
Seriously. I do things I don't wanna do.

54:41.904 --> 54:43.238
I lie.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.258
When we spoke the other day,
you had a way of putting it

54:45.282 --> 54:46.926
that I thought
was very interesting and succinct.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.660
Could you tell us all what you said?

54:50.537 --> 54:52.664
I said that secrets are lies.

54:53.874 --> 54:55.250
Secrets are lies.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.211
Go on.

54:59.379 --> 55:04.635
Secrets are what make crimes possible.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.513
We behave worse
when we're not accountable.

55:08.931 --> 55:11.308
I was my worst self

55:11.391 --> 55:13.977
because I didn't think
anyone was watching.

55:15.604 --> 55:16.604
I thought...

55:18.190 --> 55:19.191
that I was alone.

55:20.317 --> 55:24.071
So, what did you see
on this kayaking trip, Mae?

55:24.154 --> 55:26.365
- Was it beautiful?
- It was.

55:27.533 --> 55:29.243
There was almost a full moon.

55:30.369 --> 55:31.620
And it felt like...

55:33.664 --> 55:37.084
it felt like I was paddling
through liquid silver.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.670
Hmm, sounds incredible.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.839
But there's no record of any of it.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.925
- Not outside my own memory.
- Hmm.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.388
Okay.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.932
So now here we get
into something personal.

55:52.015 --> 55:56.144
As you know, I have a son, Gunner,

55:57.229 --> 55:59.606
who was born with cerebral palsy.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.775
And though he's living a very full life

56:01.858 --> 56:04.820
and we're always trying
to improve his opportunities,

56:04.903 --> 56:07.948
he is confined to a wheelchair.

56:08.031 --> 56:11.034
He can't walk.

56:11.118 --> 56:13.036
He can't run.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.289
He can't go kayaking.

56:16.498 --> 56:20.043
So, what does he do if he wants
to experience something like that?

56:20.127 --> 56:22.129
Well, he watches video.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.672
He looks at pictures.

56:24.881 --> 56:29.011
And much of his experiences of the world
come through the experience of others.

56:29.094 --> 56:32.723
When he experiences the view
of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya,

56:32.806 --> 56:34.933
he feels like he's climbed Mount Kenya.

56:37.144 --> 56:40.606
When he sees firsthand video
from an America's Cup crew member,

56:40.689 --> 56:45.777
he feels in some way that he's sailed
in the America's Cup too.

56:45.861 --> 56:49.239
And these experiences
were facilitated by generous humans

56:49.323 --> 56:52.409
who shared what they saw with the world,
my son included,

56:52.492 --> 56:54.971
and there are many others out there
that are just like Gunner.

56:54.995 --> 56:57.623
Now does it feel right
to have deprived them

56:57.706 --> 56:59.416
of seeing what you saw, Mae?

57:03.086 --> 57:04.087
It doesn't.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.425
It feels very wrong.

57:11.386 --> 57:12.512
It was selfish.

57:14.389 --> 57:19.728
When you deprive others of experiences
like the ones I had,

57:22.606 --> 57:24.608
you're essentially stealing from them.

57:25.651 --> 57:30.072
Knowledge is a basic human right.

57:32.532 --> 57:38.914
Access to all possible human experience
is a basic human right.

57:52.302 --> 57:55.847
Thank you, Mae, for your candor
and your consummate humanity.

57:55.931 --> 57:58.016
Now... now the best part.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.727
In the interest of sharing
everything she can with the world,

58:00.811 --> 58:03.522
Mae has, uh... Mae has some news.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.318
From now on...

58:10.237 --> 58:16.952
I'll be wearing a modified
SeeChange camera at all times.

58:19.454 --> 58:21.665
I'm going fully transparent.

58:24.668 --> 58:26.712
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.

58:28.755 --> 58:32.259
I'll be starting immediately.

58:32.342 --> 58:33.342
That's right.

58:35.137 --> 58:38.724
Mae will be the first Circler
to share every single second

58:38.807 --> 58:41.935
of her work
and her personal life with the public,

58:42.019 --> 58:44.312
so let's give her an even bigger hand!

58:54.364 --> 58:55.615
I'm proud of you.

59:01.246 --> 59:04.041
Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae!

59:04.124 --> 59:05.417
Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae!

59:24.061 --> 59:25.413
<i>Hello.</i>

59:25.437 --> 59:27.397
Good morning, everyone.

59:27.481 --> 59:30.692
<i>The sun is shining,
and I definitely need my coffee.</i>

59:31.902 --> 59:34.863
We are in my third week of transparency,

59:34.946 --> 59:37.032
and we're up to...

59:37.115 --> 59:41.203
2,308,007 viewers.

59:41.286 --> 59:42.120
<i>Wow.</i>

59:42.204 --> 59:44.372
Did I tell you guys
I'm not a morning person?

59:45.540 --> 59:49.252
Okay, among all of those viewers...

59:50.378 --> 59:51.378
are...

59:52.214 --> 59:54.591
- <i>I don't even know what...</i>
- Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.

59:54.674 --> 59:56.510
<i>- Hi!
- Hi, Mae.</i>

59:56.593 --> 59:58.095
Say hello to everyone.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.222
<i>Hello, Circle.</i>

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.808
Look. We match.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.476
<i>- Yeah.
- We sure do.</i>

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:07.020
<i>- These are great.
- Very stylish.</i>

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.272
I love you guys. I'll see you later.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.650
<i>- Love you. Bye.
- Love you too, sweetheart.</i>

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:20.867
- Hello, Circlers.
<i>- Hi, Mae.</i>

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.954
So this is where I worked
when I first arrived at the Circle,

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:27.415
and this is where I still work
at the Circle.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:30.210
Because even though I have you guys
looking over my shoulder...

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.588
I'm still basically a guppy.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:38.426
- Go! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.388
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.658
<i>What are you doing?
Tell your own stories, sheep.</i>

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:46.059
<i>Stop looking at us, sheep!</i>

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.769
<i>All right, that's our scene.</i>

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.605
Whoo!

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:55.110
Sorry about that. Okay, so, next up,
we just need the name of a person

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:59.030
who is historically significant.

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:02.200
- Mae Holland!
- Oh, my God!

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.785
<i>Sorry, we don't know who that is.</i>

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:07.247
She's nobody, trust me.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.168
Home sweet home.

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.503
Speaking of which,
let's check in with the folks.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.091
Hey, where are you guys?

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:23.972
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.975
<i>- Yeah. There you go.</i>
- Whoa! Ah!

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.435
Um...

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.729
Uh, I hope the engineers are watching,

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.124
because that definitely
shouldn't have happened

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:36.484
and, um, it definitely
won't happen again.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.254
You can trust me there.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.166
<i>This is me brushing my teeth.</i>

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.335
<i>If you're enjoying this,
I'm worried about you.</i>

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.269
Good night, everyone.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.023
I'm not gonna lie, it was a crazy day,

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:18.193
but I'm happy I had you with me,
each and every one of you.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.744
<i>Never a boring day here.</i>

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:14.040
A lot of you guys have been asking me
about this sculpture,

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.417
which is a treat for me.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.211
I finally get to use
my art history degree.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.172
<i>This was made by an artist
who has frequently been in trouble</i>

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.757
<i>in his own country.</i>

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:26.845
I wanna thank all the watchers
who sent frowns to the government there,

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.889
both for their persecution of the artist

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.642
and for their restriction
on Internet freedoms.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:37.105
We have sent 180 million frowns
from the U.S. alone.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.317
You can bet that's gonna have
an effect on the regime.

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.112
Annie.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:47.907
<i>Annie.</i>

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.410
Annie!

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.830
Annie!

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.214
Annie!

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.927
Annie Allerton!

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:19.855
Are we alone?

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.736
I have three minutes to use the bathroom
without the video on.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.237
Pervs.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.532
How are you?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.536
- Good.
- Well...

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.621
you should be good.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:35.705
You're killing it.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:37.791
Do you think?

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.834
Oh, come on,
false modesty won't work here.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:40.918
You should be psyched.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.128
Yeah.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.257
- I am.
- You're a meteor. It's insane.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.361
People are coming to me
trying to get to you.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:49.552
It's... crazy.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:52.597
How are you really, Annie?

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.058
You look wiped.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.144
Thanks, Mae.
You know how much I like to be told

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.039
right after I appear
in front of your millions

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.690
that I look terrible.
Thank you, you're sweet.

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:04.067
Let me take you for dinner.

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:07.987
You gotta eat sometime.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:11.533
Your camera and me looking so terrible.
That sounds fantastic, but, no.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:14.202
I just...
I'm worried about you.

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:17.372
- You're working too hard.
- You're worried about me?

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.207
You're... I'm worried about the EU,

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.726
but it's good to know
you're worried about me.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.211
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Don't worry in any way.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.509
- I know you can handle it.
- Oh, thank you, Mae.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.178
Your confidence in me
will be the wind beneath my wings.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.139
How are your parents?

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:39.727
Sorry.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.983
They're over that little... episode?

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.865
I haven't heard from them, actually.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.910
I guess it'll just take some time.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.121
Sorry, Mae. Shit.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.291
I'm fried.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.170
And I have to pull another all-nighter.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.965
Stenton is on my ass all the time.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.510
I shouldn't have questioned him
about that whole Senator Williamson thing.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:17.223
And then...
there's all the new work on Completion.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.143
But I assume Bailey told you about that.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:24.898
Of course.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.274
Of course.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.517
I'll be there
at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:29.568
What?

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.407
- There's a Concept Kingdom...
- I know what it is. But you're going?

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:39.287
- Yeah. Bailey said I should be there.
- And broadcast it?

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.707
- Is that a problem?
- No.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.502
I'm just surprised, that's all.
Those meetings are sensitive.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.671
You know, maybe he's planning on
having you attend just the beginning.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:51.007
I mean, Mae,
you're in over your head.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.136
Are you leaving?

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.554
Yeah.

01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.225
I'm really so far behind on everything,
I could just die.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.188
Annie?

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.296
<i>Hello.</i>

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.193
See ya.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:25.875
<i>So here's how many people voted
in the last national election.</i>

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.920
<i>Here's how many were eligible to vote.</i>

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:35.260
And here is how many Americans
are registered in the Circle.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.680
And there's that guy.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.890
So now we get down to the meat
of today's session,

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.102
something we've discussed
with Congresswoman Santos and others.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:51.901
What if... your Circle profile
automatically registered you to vote?

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:56.072
With True You,
in order to set up a profile,

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.825
you have to be a real person
with a real address,

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:02.537
the complete personal info,
real social security number,

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.747
with all the information
that the government wants

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.791
when you register to vote.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:10.920
So why wouldn't the state
consider you already registered

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:12.630
when you open a Circle account?

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.300
There's no reason.

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:20.345
Uh, we've got verbal commitments
from governors of almost every state,

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:25.435
and they've agreed to push for legislation
that would make your Circle account

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:28.062
an automatic path to voter registration.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:31.314
Bravo.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.362
I think it's a great idea.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.162
Well, yes, Mae.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:50.084
Why couldn't we take it one step further?

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:52.462
I mean, I...

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:56.131
I don't have it
completely figured out yet...

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:59.344
No, no, no, go on, go on, go on.
You started really well there.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:02.388
I like those words, "one step further."
It's how the company was built.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:08.519
Okay. Working backwards from your goal...

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:10.188
Go on.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:13.149
We all agree 100 percent participation
is what we'd like.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.734
A hundred percent participation
is the ideal.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:18.988
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:23.451
And we already have 83 percent
of voting-age Americans

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:24.952
registered to the Circle.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.245
Yep.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.163
And it seems we're on our way

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:32.460
to users being able to register it
and maybe actually vote

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.604
through their Circle account.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:38.174
Well, that's a small leap, but... Yes.
Okay, go on.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:45.430
Why not require every voting-age citizen
to have a Circle account?

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.350
Let her finish. Let her finish.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.813
Okay, I know the initial reaction
will be resistance.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:55.316
I mean, how can we require anyone
to use our services?

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.337
But there are all kinds of things
that are mandatory

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.505
for citizens of this country.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.489
Yep. We have to pay taxes
we don't wanna pay.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.199
And we have to pay for Social Security.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.952
- We have to serve on juries.
- Right.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.454
And we have to pee indoors,
not on the street.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.832
- We do. We do have to be pee indoors.
- She's right.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.126
I mean, we have thousands of laws.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:16.379
We require citizens
to do hundreds of things,

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:19.173
but we don't require them to vote?

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.470
They are already doing this
in dozens of countries.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:28.975
With the technology we already have,
users will already be registered.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:34.188
That means you have 241 million voters
eligible to vote.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:38.818
You have 241 million voters
that have to vote.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.281
You have the full will of the nation.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:46.033
- And how exactly do we do that?
- Annie.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:51.789
Well, you know,
it could be something as simple as a zing,

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:56.210
"Hey, Annie.
Remember to take five minutes and vote."

01:10:56.294 --> 01:11:00.506
It's what we would do
with our own surveys. You know that.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:04.927
- But, Mae, what about stragglers?
- We all pay taxes.

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.931
And what, 80 percent of us
did that online last year.

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:14.103
Why not stop duplicating services?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.566
Why not just make it all part
of one unified system?

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:23.529
You could pay your taxes,
vote, pay your parking ticket,

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.823
all through your Circle account.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:28.618
We'd save users hundreds of hours
of inconvenience.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.954
- We'd save the government billions.
- Hundreds of billions.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.248
We could eliminate half of it overnight.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.613
Why wouldn't the government
just build a similar service?

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:37.960
Why the hell does it need us?

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:44.008
It would cost too much.
They don't have the expertise.

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:47.470
- We already have the infrastructure.
- You're absolutely right.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:51.891
The government needs us
more than we need them.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:56.270
Imagine having the full will
of the people.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:58.898
Instantly.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.529
You'd have... true democracy

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.865
for the first time in human history.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.082
This is such bullshit.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.668
No voter suppression.
You're voting from home.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:21.420
<i>Think of the implications
for totalitarian regimes.</i>

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.089
No more rigged elections.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.275
The UN can demand
that they're held through the Circle.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:28.302
But only if everyone is heard.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.138
Every human on Earth.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:33.224
We can take the pulse of the nation,

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:36.811
<i>everyone in the world in seconds
on any subject.</i>

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.063
- It's the only way, right?
- Right.

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:40.398
Yeah!

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:47.238
So it looks like I've got 20 minutes here.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.782
Let's try Mom and Dad.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.179
Hey, Mae, what's up?

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.204
Hi.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:03.671
- Hey, where have you been?
<i>- Mae.</i>

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.924
I've seen your cameras aren't working.
I can send Tech out...

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.552
<i>Yeah, we disconnected them.</i>

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.178
<i>Sweetheart...</i>

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:15.725
<i>We're sorry, but we,
we can't keep doing this.</i>

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:19.520
<i>It's... Well, it's more than we ever...</i>

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:22.690
<i>You know we love you,
and we don't wanna...</i>

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:27.028
<i>- We love you. We love you.
- We have to have our privacy.</i>

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.615
<i>And we're worried you don't realize
what you've gotten yourself into.</i>

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:31.741
I'm so sorry.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.160
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.179
<i>- It's not you. It's us.
- No, we know that.</i>

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:39.165
<i>- Yeah, it's us.
- We just need you to understand that.</i>

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:45.129
- I love you.
<i>- We love you too.</i>

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:46.212
<i>Bye, honey.</i>

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:52.269
<i>- </i> You're the one, Mae!
- You're changing the world, Mae!

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:15.034
Hello, everyone. I'm Mae Holland.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:21.624
Okay.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:25.336
We've had some good weeks
thinking about Completion,

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:28.589
envisioning a day when everyone
is in the Circle,

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:32.635
when all of humanity
is connected and united.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.388
And it will happen.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.932
Already, 22 nations have agreed
in principle

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:41.268
to operate their elections
through the Circle

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:46.190
with mandatory participation
from all of its citizens.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:57.702
And when everyone is united,
everyone is known, heard, accountable,

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.621
they can be better served.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:05.167
But what about the people
who aren't part of the Circle,

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:08.671
who don't want to be woven
into the fabric of society

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:12.383
or worse, want to tear out that fabric?

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:17.596
I want to introduce Soul Search.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.642
And we're putting it to the test
in front of the entire Circle audience,

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:25.021
here and globally.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.105
Do you feel ready?

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.232
Hell, yeah!

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.900
<i>You went well so far.</i>

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.068
<i>Great.</i>

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:38.701
In seconds, the computer will select,
at random, a fugitive from justice,

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:42.204
a proven menace to our global community.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:46.375
Our assertion is that
whoever he or she is,

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:50.796
Soul Search will locate them
in under 20 minutes.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.757
Wow.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.762
Let's select that fugitive.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.098
Okay.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:03.768
This is Fiona Highbridge,

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:06.771
44 years old born in Manchester, England.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:10.149
She was convicted
of triple murder in 2004.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.651
She locked her three children
in the closet

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.988
and went on holiday to Spain.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:19.533
They all starved.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:23.579
She was sent to prison in England
but escaped

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:26.707
with the help of a guard
who she apparently seduced.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:32.713
Over a billion people are watching.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:34.673
Let's see how many are in the UK.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.969
Do you all think 14 million Brits

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.764
and a billion global
participants worldwide

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:45.059
can find Fiona Highbridge
in under 20 minutes?

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.462
Yeah!

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.772
Yeah!

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.899
All right.

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.567
Let's bring up the clock.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.278
Good.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:59.740
Is everyone ready?

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.200
On your mark...

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:03.953
get set...

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.287
go!

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.298
Okay, time to get serious.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:46.829
<i>I've got her, Mae.</i>

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:49.372
<i>That's her.</i>

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.251
Be careful.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.334
<i>I will.</i>

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:03.596
Whoa!

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:05.763
Whoa!

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.150
<i>Fiona! Stop!</i>

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:20.279
- Follow her.
<i>- Stop her!</i>

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.989
<i>Somebody stop her! She's a killer!</i>

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.283
<i>Stop her!</i>

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.577
<i>Somebody stop her!</i>

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:29.788
- Go!
- Grab her!

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.793
<i>Stop her!</i>

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:37.004
<i>Somebody grab her!</i>

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:39.590
- <i>She must be kept safe.</i>
- Keep her safe.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.927
<i>- It's Fiona Highbridge!</i>
<i>- </i><i>No! No! No!</i>

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.273
<i>All right. Watch it.</i>

01:18:58.943 --> 01:18:59.943
<i>No.</i>

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.570
Stop the clock.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:06.450
Soul Search, baby!

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:08.994
I guess that's it.

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:21.131
Let's do another!

01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:22.216
We could.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.362
- Um...
<i>- Maybe not a fugitive this time.</i>

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:27.346
Let's try for a regular civilian.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:30.641
Okay, everyone.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.519
We're gonna find a regular person.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.647
It can be anyone.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:39.608
A relative, a lost love.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:44.488
When everyone can be found,
we can never lose a friend.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.284
We can take a suggestion
from the audience.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:52.371
- Uh... anyone?
- Find Mercer!

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.918
I'm pretty sure
he doesn't wanna be found.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.963
- Anyone else?
- Where's Mercer?

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:05.342
<i>No, Mae, this is what Soul Search
is all about as well as Completion.</i>

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:06.427
Other suggestions?

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:08.363
- Let's try Mercer.
- Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.406
<i>It's the whole point
of Soul Search, Mae.</i>

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:10.264
No.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.558
Mercer! Mercer!

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.536
- Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.228
No, I...

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.731
<i>Mae, this is the right choice.</i>

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.108
Wait. Hey, everybody.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:23.071
Hey.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.946
I think it's time we reunited
Mae and Mercer, don't you?

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.158
All right then.
And through the power of the Circle,

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.744
let's bring them
back together again, okay?

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:35.581
The perfect use of Soul Search.
Let's find your friend.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.418
Go, Mae, now.

01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:52.389
Okay.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:21:01.607
So our second Soul Search today
involves not a fugitive from justice,

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:04.109
but you might say a fugitive from, um...

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:06.444
a friendship.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.372
This is my friend Mercer.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:20.000
I haven't seen him in a while.

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.377
I'd love to see him again.

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:27.758
Like Fiona, though, he is someone
who is trying not to be found,

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.843
but unlike Fiona, he's not a criminal.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.554
He's good, people.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.194
Let's see if we can break
our previous record.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.899
Whoo!

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.463
Oh, yeah.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:08.841
Unbelievable.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.843
Can you believe that? Yes!

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:14.596
<i>Do you think he's in here?</i>

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.184
<i>- Mercer!
- Mercer!</i>

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.185
<i>Mercer, are you in there?</i>

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.938
<i>Are you, like, killing deer,
making chandeliers?</i>

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:27.710
<i>Mercer, we know you're in there.
We see your truck. It's right here.</i>

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:29.587
<i>- I think he's in there.
- Fine. Let's go around.</i>

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:32.865
<i>Oh, my God, he's in there!</i>

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.825
<i>Mercer, come out. He's gotta be here.</i>

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:37.119
Remember to be nice, okay?

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.522
<i>Mercer, we know you're in there.</i>

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:40.414
You found where he is. You did it.

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:41.748
I think we should leave.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:44.460
<i>No, Mae, stay on this.</i>

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.628
<i>You've got millions of people
enjoying this.</i>

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:48.380
<i>There he is. There he is.</i>

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:51.216
<i>There he is. We just got Mercer.
I cannot believe this.</i>

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.020
<i>There he is! He's in the driveway!</i>

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:01.977
<i>Leave me alone! Jesus Christ!</i>

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.833
You're kidding me.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:31.840
Can someone please get me audio
on the camera?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.968
Mercer.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:38.013
Mercer, stop driving. It's just me.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:39.723
Mercer, stop the truck.

01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.934
You're surrounded by friends.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.062
Can we turn the speaker up?

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:47.314
Mercer.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:49.983
Can you hear me?

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.653
Mercer, it's me.

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.376
You're surrounded by friends.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.952
Mercer, stop.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:24.851
How you doing, sweetie?

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.982
You've been in bed for three days.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.986
Come out in the garden
with me today, okay?

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.406
I've got some new snapdragons
that need to be planted.

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:39.700
Okay?

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:41.910
Honey.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.164
Oh, honey.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.501
Oh.

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:53.922
Oh.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:56.526
<i>The California
Department of Motor Vehicles</i>

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:59.177
<i>has proposed regulation
that self-driving cars</i>

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:02.222
<i>should be required to have
a licensed driver inside.</i>

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.724
<i>Is that a good principle?</i>

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:06.643
<i>Yeah, I mean, I think obviously,</i>

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:09.229
<i>where technology is today
that is a good principle,</i>

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.708
<i>and of course, we would not suggest
putting something unsafe on the road.</i>

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:13.191
<i>That's why we have fed...</i>

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.391
<i>Mae.</i>

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:12.811
Where are you?

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.605
- Are we alone?
- Yes.

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:16.690
Are we?

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:17.774
Yes.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:22.946
How is it daytime where you are?

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:25.407
Wait, you're in Scotland.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.993
Yep, I went home. Can you see?

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:31.413
What happened?

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:34.291
What, besides almost ODing
on speed and Soylent?

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:36.126
Well, I found out I'm allergic to wheat.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:42.716
Um... I don't know.

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.092
I guess I almost died?

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:49.848
Oh, come on, no, don't.
Don't make me cry.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.350
Come on. No.
I'm not going to cry anymore.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.601
You getting better there?

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:58.690
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:04.404
I eat. I look out the window.
I come out here, and I think I daydream.

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:05.572
Hadn't done that in years.

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:08.158
I'm glad you called.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:12.788
I didn't want to lose you, too.

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:15.332
<i>I know.</i>

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.419
Listen, Mae, I'm really,
really sorry about Mercer.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:23.298
And I'm a shit friend.
I should've said something sooner.

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:24.758
I should've, and I'm sorry.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:27.719
It's just so horrible.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:31.890
Have they spoken to you about it?

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.226
Not yet.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:37.020
I'm going in tomorrow.

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:40.357
<i>Uh-huh. They ask for forgiveness
and never for permission.</i>

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.526
They have to go.
They've broken a hundred laws.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:45.612
They've made me suffer
a thousand regulations.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:47.239
There's got to be a way to...

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.574
What? Stop people doing bad shit?

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:51.701
Yeah.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.289
Do you need some time away here, too?
I've got an extra bed if you want it.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:04.756
This feels so good, just being with you.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.384
- Even like this.
- Yeah.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.719
Yeah. I know.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.225
This is going to sound crazy. But...

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.352
I keep having this feeling that...

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:20.772
Mercer would still be here
if we hadn't lost touch.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.816
No, come on,
what were you supposed to do?

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.193
I mean, you know, he drifted away.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.320
It happens.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:30.490
Yes, but we have this technology,
all this power.

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:33.952
Well, I mean, technology
didn't exactly help the situation.

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:36.955
What if it could?

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:46.214
Hey, your dad woke up at 4:00
this morning,

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.133
and your light was still on.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.802
What were you doing in your room?
Were you on the phone?

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.139
It helped.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.057
I have friends all over the world.

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:58.476
They care.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.894
Mm.

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:03.565
- I spoke to Annie.
- How is she?

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.275
Good. Better.

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.111
I realized how much I missed her.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.159
I have to go back.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.660
Go back where?

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.205
Not to the Circle.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:21.333
The Circle didn't kill Mercer, Mom.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.960
It was a bad tool, a bad system.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.963
It... It can be fixed.

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:31.009
We're not gonna become Amish, Mom.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.720
I... When someone dies in a plane crash,

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:37.724
you don't abandon planes,
you make them safer.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.476
Mae, at least wait a bit.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.436
I'm the only one who can do this.

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:43.938
I'm sorry.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.108
I love you.

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.926
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:15.887
<i>Mae. How are you holding up?</i>

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.932
<i>Better, actually.
I'm coming in to see them today.</i>

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:22.352
<i>- But I need your help.
- Sure. Name it, anything you need.</i>

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:54.443
We were worried
when we didn't hear from you for so long.

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.219
We were very concerned.

01:31:56.302 --> 01:31:58.596
No contact for four days.
Your camera was off.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:31:59.680
How are you doing?

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:03.809
I'm okay.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:06.914
Tom and I have been talking
about how little we knew

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.857
about this young man Mercer.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.151
He's someone we should
have been able to help.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:13.987
A fund should be established
for his family.

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:17.615
Yeah, absolutely, that's done.

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:20.660
Listen, Mae, we would like
to offer you a new role

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:25.415
here at the Circle
with no formal obligation,

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:27.459
maybe a lighter schedule.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.044
You can choose your own projects,
and you can think long-term.

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:32.464
You could take pottery, if you wanted.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.066
I don't know if you're aware of this,

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:36.843
- but one of our founders, Ty Lafitte...
- Yeah.

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:42.223
...was given the same opportunity,
and now he loves his freedom.

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:45.518
And I don't know
if this is any consolation,

01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:48.980
but at our next Dream Friday...

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.940
We're going to imagine a world

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:54.736
in which every disturbed young man
could be kept safe.

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:57.739
Would you like to join us?

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.494
I'm not sure I'm ready for that. But...

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:05.538
thanks for the invitation.

01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:07.539
Take your time.

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:36.569
I did what you asked.
You won't believe the shit I found.

01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:41.074
It's worse than I could've imagined.
And, and look, Mae, I'm so sorry.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:45.036
I never met him, but they should build
a monument to Mercer.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.959
- Yeah.
- I mean, this... this changes everything.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:54.087
Okay, he's the martyr
who will wake everyone up, right?

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.632
I don't know what you're planning,
but if you turn that camera back on,

01:33:57.715 --> 01:34:00.635
whatever you say about the Circle
is heard around the world,

01:34:00.718 --> 01:34:02.345
and it changes everything.

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:18.735
<i>Hello</i>.

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:23.408
Hello again.

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:30.456
<i>- Hi!
- Hey, Mae.</i>

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:41.634
And that is how it should have been,

01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:44.220
how it could've been,
but we didn't have the technology.

01:34:44.304 --> 01:34:45.555
But we will.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:47.015
And when we do,

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:50.393
when every vehicle
is known and connected,

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:53.813
the data we have will help us
improve traffic patterns,

01:34:53.897 --> 01:35:00.486
keep drivers safe, and optimize
Circle services across all platforms.

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.698
Shopping. Lodging.

01:35:03.781 --> 01:35:05.325
Attractions.

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.036
Attractions like Mae Holland.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:09.799
Mae, come on out here.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:12.248
<i>Come on out here. Gosh, Mae.</i>

01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:14.667
<i>Oh, you're transparent again.
Look at that.</i>

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.920
Hello, hello.

01:35:17.003 --> 01:35:18.003
Mae Holland.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:21.549
Welcome back, Mae!

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:27.013
Now, Mae is a brave person

01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:28.932
because even amid her grieving,

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:33.853
she knows that she has a responsibility
to her followers,

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:35.480
to the whole world, really.

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:41.486
Thanks for saying that, Eamon.
And I couldn't agree with you more.

01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:45.823
I know that Tom, he agrees, too.

01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:49.994
Right, Tom? You want to come out?

01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:52.705
- Come on.
- There you are.

01:35:56.668 --> 01:36:00.171
First, I want to thank everyone here
and around the world

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:03.591
for the support you've given me
since we lost Mercer.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:08.429
These past days,
I've realized something about myself

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:09.681
and about the Circle.

01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:13.184
It's that I don't want to be disconnected.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.564
I don't want to have to search
for friends, family, my loved ones.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:21.275
We lost track of Mercer.

01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:25.405
But what if we never lost touch
with each other?

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.409
What if instead of searching...

01:36:30.743 --> 01:36:31.911
we always knew?

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:38.960
What I am proposing is radical openness
and unbroken connection.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.673
It would have to start here.

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:45.425
Mm-hm.

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:48.886
You know the usual hypocrisy
of the digital world.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:53.141
We want everything in the Cloud,
and yet our leaders...

01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.936
live above it.

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:01.649
So I want to invite Eamon and Tom

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:06.112
to join me in this experiment
that they've pioneered.

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:13.494
I invite them to set an example
for the Circle and the world...

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:18.124
to go transparent.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.422
What do you say, guys?

01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:27.425
Will you join me?

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:38.561
Wouldn't it be great to know
their every move, their every word?

01:37:38.644 --> 01:37:43.024
From now on,
every message, meeting, phone call,

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:48.362
all will be public,
knowable, never erased.

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.699
In fact, Ty Lafitte has helped us
make every document

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:55.411
in the company's history public.

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:58.039
Every message, every plan including...

01:37:58.122 --> 01:38:01.375
And this is my favorite part,
every e-mail,

01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:05.505
from Tom and Eamon's accounts,
and their private accounts...

01:38:06.506 --> 01:38:08.692
...and their secondary
confidential accounts.

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:12.678
And even their super-secret
scrambled code accounts,

01:38:12.762 --> 01:38:18.684
that nobody, not even their assistants
or wives knew existed.

01:38:20.186 --> 01:38:21.312
Until now.

01:38:24.273 --> 01:38:26.150
It's all been sent to you already.

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.989
We are so fucked.

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:35.993
I think we're entitled
to that kind of access. Don't you?

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:39.497
Yeah.

01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:42.792
Mae, you are a very brave woman
to do this.

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:51.759
There are no more secrets.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:53.594
Privacy was a temporary thing.

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:55.888
And now it's over.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.809
We won't live in the shadows anymore.

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.437
Hey. Good timing.

01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:24.000
Thank you.

01:39:25.251 --> 01:39:26.919
Thank you.

01:39:27.003 --> 01:39:33.968
I'm tired of hiding,
these passwords and secret knocks,

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.846
the difference between public and private.

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:39.515
Aren't you all?

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.894
Come to think of it,

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:44.896
I'm tired of standing here in the dark.

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:48.065
Don't worry.

01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:52.945
Eamon will catch up. Or maybe he won't.

01:39:53.029 --> 01:39:55.781
Either way, it's time for a change.

01:39:55.865 --> 01:39:57.783
We're gonna remake this place.

01:39:57.867 --> 01:40:03.456
And if we do it right,
we will set an example for everyone.

01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:05.124
The future won't wait.

01:40:49.335 --> 01:40:50.336
