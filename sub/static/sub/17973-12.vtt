DONNA: Cleveland, stop,

00:39.440 --> 00:42.107
Is that
our heating duct?

00:42.109 --> 00:43.175
It was.

Wow, this is...

00:54.822 --> 00:57.923
You did it, Donna,
you really did it.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.458
I'm a sculptor now.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.427
It's my second career.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.495
Well, that and I'm
going to sell the house

01:03.497 --> 01:05.597
as a rental property
and be the manager.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.866
Sweetie, do you think
you could possibly,

01:07.868 --> 01:10.269
maybe be having
some sort

01:10.271 --> 01:12.371

01:12.373 --> 01:13.705
I'm not the one in crisis!

01:13.707 --> 01:15.507
You're the one in crisis!

01:15.509 --> 01:17.876
Oh, Cleveland,
I'm sorry.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.378
I just need to be held.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.979
What is happening to me?

01:20.981 --> 01:24.917
It's okay, you're just going
through the terrible 42s.

Cleveland,
are you trying

to use the Force
to get the remote?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.171
No.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.707
You will make me
a roast beef sandwich

01:48.709 --> 01:51.343
and a glass
of tomato juice.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.946
Make your own
damn sandwich.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.781
There is another.

Thank you.

So, you nervous that you're
up for reelection on Tuesday?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.414
(blows raspberry)
Hardly.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.849
My record is impeccable

02:30.851 --> 02:33.685

are always reelected.

Well, thanks

03:36.584 --> 03:39.084

to tell a woman

what she can and cannot do

'Cause I'm student body
president and what I say goes.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.371
Do black people
still say "fly"?

04:32.373 --> 04:33.472
I don't know.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.540
Just because a bunch
of nerds voted for him,

04:35.542 --> 04:37.476
he thinks
he's so fly.

get those clothes?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.284
I brought 'em from my home
right here in Stoolbend,

05:19.286 --> 05:22.487

05:25.693 --> 05:30.662
And I'm announcing my candidacy
for student body president

05:30.664 --> 05:35.100
because we need a leader,
not an eater.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.368
(all laughing)

05:36.370 --> 05:38.437
That's funny and incisive.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.807
Is that the level of discourse
we want at our school?

05:41.809 --> 05:43.375
She got boobies.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.610
Did somebody say "boobies"?

05:45.612 --> 05:47.512

05:47.514 --> 05:50.682
See, I told you
voters were dumb.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.451
Now, get some
stupid chant going.

must be preserved.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.764

06:23.783 --> 06:26.785

I could record a demo.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.089
Honey, what if sometime in
the extremely near future,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.925
some friends of
mine-- say, the guys--

06:33.927 --> 06:35.494
invited me on
a hunting trip?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.995
Absolutely not.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.997
Your drunken friends
with firearms?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.432
You could get killed.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.502
(playing "Taps")

06:46.372 --> 06:48.473
(voice breaking):
Then what would I do?

06:48.475 --> 06:50.509
I suppose I'd start over.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.978
Dye my hair blonde.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.447
Do you think I'd look good
with blonde hair?

06:55.449 --> 06:56.648
Is that your thing?

06:56.650 --> 06:57.649
No.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.184
On an unrelated
note, you see

06:59.186 --> 07:01.253
all these bags
I've got packed here?

07:01.255 --> 07:05.757

...farts

you need that course,

how you do it.

Of course, Mr. President.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.936

Yep.

Anything?

09:29.336 --> 09:30.368
What?!

09:30.370 --> 09:32.304
Oh, well, I thought
that might reverse it.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.472
You'd be surprised
how often that works.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.441
The good news is,
it's a temporary impairment.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.442

hearing

Great! But what do
I tell my wife?

09:41.348 --> 09:45.183
If she finds out I lied to her
and went on a hunting trip,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.919
she'll go all Elin Woods on me!

09:50.656 --> 09:52.257
A'ight, then.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.291
Cleveland, you should know,

much louder than...

10:03.336 --> 10:05.437
I'm home...

10:05.439 --> 10:06.638
Yah!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.840
We are suing
the Rite Aid.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.442
Remember last month
when I told you

10:10.444 --> 10:11.442
about that cashier bitch

10:11.444 --> 10:14.279
who always judges me when
I buy antifungal cream?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.280
Well, yesterday...

10:15.282 --> 10:19.184
(inaudible)

10:20.686 --> 10:24.289
Yeah, yep, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yep.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.659
Cleveland, sincerely, tell
me, was I in the wrong?

10:27.661 --> 10:29.327
(gulps)

10:30.363 --> 10:33.365
I agree with you.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.301
Finally, someone hears
what I'm saying.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.972
Now, come upstairs, I want to
give my man a real homecoming.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.273
But first, let me recap

10:42.275 --> 10:43.541
last night's entire
<i>True Blood</i> for you.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.944
You know Sookie, the one with
the worst teeth on the show?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.178
Well, she can cast
a spell on a...

10:47.180 --> 10:49.114
I think I'm onto something.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.515
Huh?
You heard that?

10:50.517 --> 10:53.451
I said, "I think
you've lost weight."

10:53.453 --> 10:55.186
You better get
in the basement.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.789
Bedroom's too clean for
what I'm about to do to you.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.357
(giggles)

11:06.265 --> 11:08.533
Voting closed two hours ago.
What have you heard?

11:08.535 --> 11:10.001
How were the exit polls?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.270
Have any of the major networks
declared a winner?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.506
Uh, no, Junior.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.042
The major networks have
not yet weighed in

11:17.044 --> 11:19.010
on your dumbass high school
election.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.378
Relax, man.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.280
Wally doesn't count
the votes till 2:00.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.016
So I broke into
his office.
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.352
Do you have another one
of those Blow Pops?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.254
Uh, yeah.
Here you go.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.288
Mm.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.024
Mm-mm-mm.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.428
Anyway, I broke into Wally's
office and took care of it.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.462
We golden.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.763
Really?
What'd you do?

11:38.765 --> 11:41.666
Let's just say it'll be
pretty hard

11:41.668 --> 11:43.435
for Roberta
to win without these.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.303
That's a lot of votes.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.339
That's all her votes.
Every single one of them.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.008
Landslide, Junior.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.509
Every single...

11:51.511 --> 11:53.044
You stole every
vote she got?!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.313
Do you have any idea how
suspicious that looks?

11:55.315 --> 11:56.614
You gotta fix it.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.149
Break into Farquhar's
office again

11:58.151 --> 11:59.584
and put back enough
of those ballots

11:59.586 --> 12:01.119
so it doesn't look fishy.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.353
(bell ringing)

12:12.498 --> 12:14.499
That's a bingo.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.707
(clearing throat)

12:26.645 --> 12:28.513
Junior!
Junior told me to do it!

12:28.515 --> 12:30.882
All Junior's fault!
I'll wear a wire!

12:33.419 --> 12:38.990
(loudly): Guys! I've got an
incredible secret. Huddle up.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.425
I cracked the code.

12:40.427 --> 12:45.597
I found the only three sentences
we need to say to women.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.931
One:

12:50.102 --> 12:51.436
Two:

12:55.307 --> 12:57.542
And three:

13:01.914 --> 13:04.449
Love it. Love lists.
Love letters.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.984
Wrote 30 of them
to Meredith Vieira.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.187
Asked repeatedly for a picture
of her squatting over a mirror.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.656
Closest I got was a <i>Today Show</i>
<i>promo picture of Matt, Al,</i>

13:11.658 --> 13:13.658
and Hoda Kotb squatting
over a mirror.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.494
Al had it fogged up, though.
Couldn't see anything.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.531
Is he telling the
Al Roker story again?

13:23.702 --> 13:26.104
(inaudible)

13:26.106 --> 13:27.939
(voice slowly fades in): ...this
one is called Vanilla,

13:27.941 --> 13:29.707
and the other one
is called Vanilla Bean.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.644
I have to go to the bathroom.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.445
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.
(Donna talking)

13:34.447 --> 13:36.481
I can hear! Oh, no!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.449
Oh, here we are.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.318
Cleveland, are you okay?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.021
Yup. Just poopin'.
Okay.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.356
While you're in there, take
a look at that wallpaper.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.358
You know my old collection
of sea glass

13:47.360 --> 13:49.527
that you always say does not
belong in our bedroom?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.363
How about if we make
a mosaic of...
(voice fading)

13:54.834 --> 14:00.205
(loudly): I know exactly
how you feel, and I think
you've lost weight!

14:00.207 --> 14:02.106
Aw.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.011
(inaudible)

14:07.013 --> 14:09.314
CLEVELAND:
<i>God, Pictionary sucks.</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:11.316
<i>I love not having</i>
<i>to hear my family.</i>

14:11.318 --> 14:13.151
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>Something's happening.</i>

14:14.653 --> 14:18.389
We're happy and
jumping. Yay!

14:25.931 --> 14:29.634
So anyway, I sure am hungry.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.303
Yeah.
Me, too.
Tell me about it.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.607
Yep. Ready... for...
din-din!

14:38.477 --> 14:40.511
Uh, where's your mother
with the damn dinner?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.980
She left, man.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.749
To obtain dinner from
a take-out emporium,

14:44.751 --> 14:46.251
or automat cafeteria, or...

14:46.253 --> 14:47.685
No, dummy.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.455
She left for Florida,
like we talked about.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.290
Yeah. Ms. Donna
announced her plans...

14:52.292 --> 14:56.027
...to quit my job
and move to...

14:56.029 --> 14:57.328
Florida.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.496
That's right.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.266
Where I will attend the
University of Miami

15:01.268 --> 15:03.434
for six months to get
my graduate degree

15:03.436 --> 15:06.771
in Marine Biology with a
concentration in Dolphin History

15:06.773 --> 15:09.941
while Cleveland takes care of
you kids and all the housework.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.377
The midlife crisis is over.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.344
Yay!

15:13.346 --> 15:14.746
Find yourself, Mama.
The U!

15:14.748 --> 15:17.282
We're happy and
jumping. Yay!

15:17.284 --> 15:21.619
But the thing you've neglected
to mention is how the hell

15:21.621 --> 15:25.757
Miss Homecoming Queen expected
to pay for all this?!

15:25.759 --> 15:27.825
That was my favorite part.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.361
She asked if she could sell
your whole collection

15:30.363 --> 15:32.330
of baseball cards and stuff,
and you said,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.532
"I hear your truth.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.935
I honor your womanhood."

15:36.937 --> 15:38.970
Oh, God.
But I don't.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.306
(screaming)
My treasured keepsakes.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.342
(whimpering)

15:44.344 --> 15:49.480
No! It's gone!
It's all gone!

15:49.482 --> 15:53.351
Well, at least she
didn't sell my old sub
shop mascot costume.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.488
(wolf whistle)
(whimpers)

15:57.490 --> 16:01.326
Now I remember why I keep
this in the attic.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.266
...so I've got to drive
all night to Florida,

16:08.268 --> 16:11.369
because I hadn't actually heard
a word of Donna's plan

16:11.371 --> 16:13.838
to attend school
there until now.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.875
But it does explain her
emotional good-bye this morning.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.944
(sobbing)

16:19.946 --> 16:22.613
I'm the luckiest woman
alive to have a husband

16:22.615 --> 16:25.450
who would go so far
to support my dream.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.485
Slender!

16:29.421 --> 16:31.255
All right, people.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.325
The hand goes up,
the mouths go shut.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.995
I'm here to announce
the results of the inquiry

16:36.997 --> 16:38.296
into the results
of the election.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.664
BOY:
Sounds boring.

16:41.133 --> 16:45.436
I'm declaring Roberta Tubbs
the first female president

16:45.438 --> 16:47.939
in Stoolbend High history.
(gasps)

16:47.941 --> 16:50.308
(cheering)

16:50.310 --> 16:54.979
It is an honor and a privigen
to be your president.

16:54.981 --> 16:58.182
Of course, y'all didn't elect me
for politics as usual.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.818
Therefore, I have decided
to resign,

17:00.820 --> 17:03.488
so that I may better serve
Stoolbend High

17:03.490 --> 17:05.590
from outside the office
of president

17:05.592 --> 17:07.525
where I don't have to do
extra work,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.594
or go to a bunch
of stupid meetings.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.596
Plus, I've proven my point.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.132
Uh... boobies.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.833
That's two points.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.702
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.103
(scattered applause)

17:19.105 --> 17:21.305
Wha-- seriously?

17:21.307 --> 17:23.274
She resigned?

17:23.276 --> 17:27.278
All right, anyone else
want to be president?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.781
Junior, you probably
want to do it, right?

17:29.783 --> 17:30.948
Do I?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.950
Yippee!

17:32.952 --> 17:35.253
(chanting):
Junior's fat.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.287
ALL:
Junior's fat.

17:36.289 --> 17:40.291
Junior's fat,
Junior's fat...

17:40.293 --> 17:43.561
The two-party system is a joke.

17:50.335 --> 17:54.472
Did anybody else see that
little kid disappear?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.207
Hello?

18:01.113 --> 18:02.947
Find employment.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.616
Cleveland?! What
are you doing here?

18:05.618 --> 18:07.185
Donna, manners.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.454
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your friends?
Fine.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.489
This is Kirsten,
and this is Celia.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.459
I'm beginning to matriculate.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.694
How are the kids?
Is Rallo taking his baths?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.463
Who won the election?
Who's watching them?

18:18.465 --> 18:19.664
I don't know.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.366
But right now, that's so far
down the list of reasons

18:22.368 --> 18:24.268
for you to be angry at me.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.305
Celia, Kristen-- could
you give us a moment?

18:27.307 --> 18:30.675
Actually, could you stay where
you were, but turn around?

18:30.677 --> 18:31.843
Thank you.

18:31.845 --> 18:36.481
Donna, when I told
you I was attending

18:36.483 --> 18:38.483
a cable installers'
seminar, I lied.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.584
(gasps)

18:39.586 --> 18:42.420
I actually went on
a hunting trip,

18:42.422 --> 18:46.290
where a stray gunshot caused me
to go deaf for a few days.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.292
I hid my hearing loss from you

18:48.294 --> 18:51.429
by simply agreeing
to everything you said.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.298
Wait. You said you went
deaf for a few days.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.634
Ah! Man talking.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.770
At that point, I had
begun using earplugs

18:59.772 --> 19:02.807
so as not to hear
the sound of your voice.

19:02.809 --> 19:07.512
Oh, Donna, can you ever forgive
me for behaving so unlikably?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.580
(sobbing)

19:16.622 --> 19:18.823
I should thank you
for this stupid stunt.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.591
Because when you
agreed with me,

19:20.593 --> 19:22.994
it made me believe
I could achieve my dream.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.696
And now my crisis
is over. I'm happy.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.498
All right.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.001
And I don't want to put
too fine a point on this,

19:30.003 --> 19:32.637
but technically,
I didn't really agree with you,

19:32.639 --> 19:35.873
which means you can't
achieve your dream, so...

19:35.875 --> 19:37.642
Hmm...

19:37.644 --> 19:39.177
Sorry, Cleveland.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.445
For too long, it's been
about everybody else.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.548
But now, it's got to be
about me, too.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.754
Donna, wait.
(sighs)

19:49.756 --> 19:52.857
Donna, you're my dream.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.293
You always have been.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.328
Good-bye, Cleveland.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.930
Celia, wait!

19:58.932 --> 20:00.298
DONNA:
Good-bye, Cleveland.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.568
I don't remember
the other girl's name.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.039
(rat squeaking)
Ha-ha! Ten points.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.275
Boys, stop it. No.
(door opens and closes)

20:11.277 --> 20:14.812
Donna? You're not supposed
to visit until next weekend.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.182
Yeah, well,
I'm home. For good.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.850
What is that smell?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.919
The rats got diarrhea.

20:21.921 --> 20:22.987
Thank God you're back.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.755
But why did you
change your mind?

20:24.757 --> 20:25.990
Cleveland, I love you,

20:25.992 --> 20:28.159
but I don't trust you
to raise my children.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.694
I don't trust you at all.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.630
And what I can see
bears out that judgment.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.632
Okay.
Where're your friends?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.634
And, I'm going to stop
holding myself back

20:36.636 --> 20:39.503
from shooting for everything
I've ever dreamed of,

20:39.505 --> 20:42.573
having a wonderful family
and a great career.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.510
But from now on,
there are going to be

20:46.512 --> 20:48.512
some serious changes
in our marriage.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.915
First of all, you are no longer
spending every other night

20:50.917 --> 20:53.451
with your buddies because I am
transferring to Stoolbend U

20:53.453 --> 20:55.152
where I will continue
my studies.

20:55.154 --> 20:58.823
