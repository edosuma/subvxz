00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
HxHPRC: Enjoy your hours!

00:33.900 --> 00:36.400
We're going to do
a Christmas tune for you now.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.200
You got to trust me. This one's
just a little bit different.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.100
It combines the Christmas
colors, red...

00:43.300 --> 00:44.500
...green...

00:44.800 --> 00:46.300
...and blues!

01:14.100 --> 01:17.700
Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly, happy soul

01:19.100 --> 01:23.400
He was smoking his pipe, baby
His two eyes were made of coal

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say

01:30.400 --> 01:34.400
He was made of ice and snow
Then he came to life one day

01:36.300 --> 01:40.400
Frosty the Snowman
Was as bad as he could be

01:40.800 --> 01:43.300
And the children say
He could laugh and play

01:43.500 --> 01:46.300
Just the same as you and me

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Man, check it out.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.300
It's the Jack Frost Band.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.300
They're digging it. They're loving it.
We gotta sign these guys.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.200
There must've been some magic
In the air that night

02:37.000 --> 02:40.600
For that old silk cap they found

02:42.800 --> 02:44.200
For when

02:44.700 --> 02:47.600
They laid it upon his head

02:48.100 --> 02:49.200
He began

02:50.400 --> 02:53.300
To hootchy-koo around

02:54.700 --> 02:56.100
And Frosty the Snowman

02:56.400 --> 02:58.900
Is a fairy tale they say

03:00.100 --> 03:01.900
He was made of ice and snow

03:02.200 --> 03:03.600
Till he came...

03:03.800 --> 03:04.600
...to...

03:05.200 --> 03:06.000
...life...

03:07.300 --> 03:08.800
...one day

03:22.400 --> 03:26.000
That was Medford's own Jack Frost Band.
Best band no one's ever heard of.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.200
That's recorded live last night
at Denver's Music Hall.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.800
Don't ask how we got the tape.
They are due for a break.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We got more music coming
from the '70s and '90s.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.300
No '60s. No '80s. I promise.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.700
Central Colorado's classic rock.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.500
School's out!

04:10.400 --> 04:13.100
No running. Feet are for walking.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.200
Merry Christmas, everybody.
See you next year!

04:16.600 --> 04:18.399
Merry Christmas, Miss Moon.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.899
Hey, Charlie.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.800
Happy vacation, Charlie.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.700
Snowball fight!

04:41.700 --> 04:43.600
- The brain's here.
- What's going on?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.300
The 7th graders have us pinned down.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.100
They're using the heavy artillery!

04:47.400 --> 04:49.100
Come on, how bad could it be?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.100
Two, three, launch!

04:55.100 --> 04:56.000
What was that?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.800
Bull's-eye!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
- We tried to tell you.
- Rory Buck.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.800
Alexander!

05:04.700 --> 05:05.500
Help him!

05:05.800 --> 05:07.400
Natalie, help!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.800
Eat snow, you little wieners.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.700
Huddle up. Come on.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.100
Remember what we learned
in history class?

05:22.300 --> 05:24.100
- No.
- Not really.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.600
If you want to stop an army,
stop the general.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.200
You're taking on Rory Buck?

05:30.400 --> 05:31.800
Trust me, Tuck, all right?

05:32.100 --> 05:33.500
You draw their fire.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.000
Good luck, man.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
Fire!

05:41.100 --> 05:42.100
Get him!

05:42.800 --> 05:43.900
I dare you to hit me.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.300
Load me up.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.800
- Are you all right?
- No.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.600
Come on. Give me your best shot.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.500
Can't you do better than that?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.000
Okay, that was a good one.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
Go now! Go, run!

06:05.400 --> 06:06.200
Wait!

06:08.300 --> 06:09.300
Come on, Alexander!

06:09.500 --> 06:11.200
What did you do that for, butthead?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.200
That little twerp's getting away!

06:13.800 --> 06:16.100
Run like the wind, Alexander!

06:20.000 --> 06:20.900
Are you okay?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.800
I'll take care of this one myself.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.400
Hold your fire.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.200
Rory's pissed!

06:35.200 --> 06:38.100
Well, well, well.
Little Charlie Frost.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
- Hanging with the second graders now?
- Get off, Rory.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.200
I got a present for you.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.200
Nail him, Rory.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.400
Good, I like presents.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.400
Can you say, "brain freeze"?

06:54.800 --> 06:55.900
Brain freeze.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.100
Way to go, buddy.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.100
All right, Charlie.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.700
This isn't the end of it, Frost.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
Oh, yeah! Way to go!

07:10.700 --> 07:11.900
Shut up!

07:15.500 --> 07:17.200
You okay? Good man.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.200
Thanks, Charlie. You're amazing.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.300
No problem.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.500
See you at hockey, Charlie.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.800
- See you, Natalie.
- Good job, dude.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.400
See you later.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.200
Hey, Chester.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.900
Come on, boy.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.400
Dad?

08:15.100 --> 08:15.900
Hi, Mom.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.600
It's a long drive from Denver.
You know he won't be back until late.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.800
This drain, I don't get it.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.200
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.300
So?

08:27.600 --> 08:28.700
So?

08:28.900 --> 08:32.400
So not turning over your report card
right away is a bad sign.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.200
Here.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.500
I'm going to play hockey
in the driveway.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.700
Running away. That's another bad sign.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.700
You may have your father's looks,
but you get your brains from me.

08:47.900 --> 08:51.000
Good work, Charlie.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.100
Wait till your dad sees this.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.300
Excuse me, miss?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.300
Listen, my car broke down back here.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.400
Can I borrow a couple of bucks
till I get to a gas station?

09:13.700 --> 09:15.800
Money? I'm sorry.
My husband's a musician.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.000
Really?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.400
- Is he any good?
- Yeah.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.700
Really?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.400
You know, I also left
my lip balm in the car.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.400
So I'm out, and I think
I'm feeling a little...

09:28.600 --> 09:30.000
Chapped?

09:30.800 --> 09:33.000
I wonder if I could
borrow some lip balm?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.600
I don't know if you'll like what I got.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.900
Do you mind if I try?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.500
- You like it?
- You know, I can't tell.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.200
Let me just...

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.700
Okay, that's for you.
What's for me?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.700
I hope you brought me chocolates.
Yes!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.500
He waited as long as he could.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.800
- Let's get him up.
- No. Don't get him up.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.200
Come on.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.500
He's got the whole vacation to sleep.
Come on.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.500
Dude? Charlie-boy?

10:13.900 --> 10:14.800
Charlie-boy.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.800
Dad?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Get up, man.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.700
I was just resting my eyes.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.100
You were?

10:22.300 --> 10:23.700
You looked asleep. Didn't he?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.700
You looked like you were asleep.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.300
- Exactly like you were sleeping.
- No, I was waiting up for you.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.800
Okay, you can go back to sleep.
I just wanted to say hi.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.500
I want to give you
a weather update too.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.400
It's snowing!

10:40.100 --> 10:40.900
Can I, Mom?

10:44.800 --> 10:45.900
Can I, Mom?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.100
Dad, not another fathead.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.600
He's not a fathead.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.900
He's just smart, so he needs
a big cranium for his brain.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.000
Now what?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.800
Nose. Come on, nose.

11:05.000 --> 11:05.900
I said "nose"!

11:06.100 --> 11:07.700
I thought you said "hose".

11:07.900 --> 11:09.000
Sorry.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.900
Scarf.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
Give me your hat.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.700
Thank you.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.500
Yes. Perfect.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.600
How's he look?

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
He Looks like you.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.800
He does?

11:28.100 --> 11:29.600
Only a little cuter.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.200
Good one, Mom.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.600
Really?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Really.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.300
Cuter than this?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
Don't even...

11:41.300 --> 11:42.400
You are...

11:43.200 --> 11:45.200
...so dead!

11:49.600 --> 11:51.500
You know what?
You throw like a girl.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.000
Welcome home, Jack!

11:55.200 --> 11:56.800
Now go to sleep!

11:57.200 --> 11:59.400
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.200
Sorry, Mrs. Wilkins.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Hey, seriously, from this angle...

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
...she looks hot
in that flannel nightgown...

12:15.900 --> 12:17.000
Pulling an all nighter?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.400
Get your skinny little butt
in that bed.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.600
Nice work on that snowman, dude.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.700
Thanks.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.100
- Except you made his head way too big.
- I did?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
You put the bottom ball
on the top ball.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.100
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.600
- How was Denver?
- Denver's pretty cool.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.000
Cool. How're the guys?

12:35.300 --> 12:37.000
They're great.
Everybody says hi.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.400
So?

12:38.700 --> 12:39.600
So?

12:39.900 --> 12:41.800
Is there anything you need to show me?

12:42.100 --> 12:42.900
Like?

12:43.100 --> 12:44.600
Like something in the shape...

12:45.500 --> 12:46.700
...of a present.

12:47.100 --> 12:47.900
Like from the gig?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.400
Like those plastic swords they
stick through the olives and onions?

12:51.700 --> 12:54.700
Yeah, Like for the martinis
Mom packs in my lunch.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.200
Mom's making you martinis?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.600
- I'm up to two now.
- Good.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.700
Two a day.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.400
I brought you this.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.000
One of your harmonicas?

13:15.300 --> 13:16.900
That's one of my old harmonicas.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.100
Sure you want me to have this?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.200
Absolutely I want you to have it.

13:21.900 --> 13:22.900
Where'd you get it?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.200
Where'd I get it?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.100
I got that from...

13:27.300 --> 13:30.800
...an old famous blues player named
Sonny Boy Wayne.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.000
- Yeah, right.
- I did.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.000
Sonny Boy Wayne.

13:34.300 --> 13:38.300
He was 9 feet tall and could play, man.
There was a white light around him.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.400
And he gave you this?

13:39.600 --> 13:42.200
He did. He said,
"Son, I want you to have this.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.800
It'll give you the power".

13:45.000 --> 13:46.900
Come on, seriously.
Where'd you get it?

13:47.100 --> 13:48.200
You want to know?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.100
I got that...

13:50.800 --> 13:52.200
...the morning you were born.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.700
Really?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.200
Little music store
across from the hospital.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.800
I walked out in a great mood,
bought myself that harmonica.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.300
And I never had a harmonica
that played better.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.900
My favorite one.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
- Now it's yours.
- Thanks.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.700
You're welcome. Now go to sleep.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Son...

14:11.200 --> 14:13.200
...I want you to go to sleep now.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.200
It's awesome!

14:18.900 --> 14:20.400
Okay, see you in the morning.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.700
We play hockey tomorrow.
Can you come?

14:23.900 --> 14:28.300
Yes, sir. Wait a minute, I can't.
We have to go into the studio.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.400
Well, the game's not till four.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.800
And it's against
our arch rivals, the Devils.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.200
You're 1 1. You already have arch rivals?

14:36.900 --> 14:39.800
Four. Yeah, what am I thinking?
I'm there. I'm there.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.000
Definitely.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
Great.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.200
You know another thing about this
harmonica? It has magic powers.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.600
Yeah, right.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.700
I'm serious.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.400
When you play that,
no matter where I am...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
...I can hear it.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.500
Right.

14:54.700 --> 14:55.600
I'm telling you.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.000
Good night.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.300
Love you. Go to sleep.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.100
You looking for the power?

15:06.300 --> 15:07.400
Just testing it.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.800
A major label? What do you think
of this Kaplan kid?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.300
I Like him. He's smart.
He really knows music.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.400
And you know what?
I think this guy really gets us.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.000
Oh, good.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.700
How's things at the bank?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.200
How's that new guy
in the loan department?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.600
Glenn? He's a nice guy.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.300
He hit on me.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.100
Really?

15:34.900 --> 15:37.800
How about that? Guys don't even
check for rings anymore.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.800
Relax. He's 63.
I straightened him out.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.700
You straightened him out?
What exactly does that mean?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.500
Stop it.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.500
No wonder he hit on you.
Look at you.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.900
I don't wear this to the bank.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.900
You're barely wearing it here.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.200
Sing me a smile.

15:57.900 --> 16:01.400
Well, the driver on the bus says,
"Move on back..."

16:01.700 --> 16:03.300
No, sing me the other one.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.900
My song.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Every time

16:08.400 --> 16:10.200
We say goodbye

16:11.200 --> 16:13.800
I die a little

16:14.600 --> 16:15.800
Take off your boots.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Every time

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
We say goodbye

16:20.700 --> 16:23.200
Oh, man, if I had one hit song...

16:23.900 --> 16:25.300
You will.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.100
I'd make you guys proud of me.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.800
We're already really proud of you.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.600
- Buy you a nice big house.
- I'd settle for a new sink.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
I can get you a new car,
like a Porsche.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.600
Anything but a Jeep is a sissy car.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.400
I'd get you some diamonds.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.100
All I need is you.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.400
I love you, Gab.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.600
I Love you too.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.800
'Cause when you're near

17:14.000 --> 17:15.900
There's such an air

17:16.099 --> 17:17.800
Of spring

17:18.099 --> 17:19.700
About it

17:23.500 --> 17:25.800
I bet you would Like
a snow blower, though.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.800
Lift it up.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.800
I don't remember you hanging
this many lights last year.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.800
That's because I didn't hang this many.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.700
Little straighter.
Yours is crooked on that side.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.200
If you come down a bit at your end...

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
You've come too far now.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.800
See, you've gone too far there...

18:02.600 --> 18:03.700
Be careful, Mac.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.800
You don't want to be on the wrong end
of that left hook.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
Bye, baby.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
I'll be in the car.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.500
Front of the goal, shoots.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.600
Hit the post.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.600
A little wide. But nice shot.
Who taught you that shot?

18:16.800 --> 18:17.700
Coach Gronic.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.400
Dicky Gronic?

18:19.700 --> 18:22.000
Dicky Gronic is your coach?
He can't play hockey.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.400
Dad, Sid Gronic.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.400
Sid Gronic's good.
Sid Gronic's very good.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.500
He's one of the best,
if he could stay out of prison.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.100
What was that?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.400
That's something I call the "J-shot".

18:36.700 --> 18:37.900
- Teach me.
- Come here.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.900
You're big enough to handle this now.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
- We got to go.
- Be with you in one second.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.800
Hold on a minute.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.800
Say the guy's coming down
right here, defensive man.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.200
Bring it on the stick's toe.
Back to the heel.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.200
Now cut loose.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.800
There you go. Nice shot.
Very good.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.100
- I still don't get it.
- I'll show you when I come back.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.900
But I need it for today's game.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.500
Teach you when I come back.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.000
But, Dad, I want to...

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
"Butt Dad"?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.800
Did you just call me "Butt Dad"?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Is that the kind of thing
Coach Gronic teaches you? Butt Dad?

19:10.200 --> 19:12.600
By the way, that would
make you Butt Boy. Bye.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.200
Bye, Butt Family.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
See you in a while.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.700
Love you guys. Bye.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.400
All right.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.100
Oh, man.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.800
First period's behind us.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Forget about it.
God knows I'm going to try.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.600
I know you're just kids.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.600
And we're really here to teach you...

19:38.800 --> 19:41.700
...fair play and sportsmanship
and all that crap.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.400
But I am so tired of Looking
up at that scoreboard...

19:46.600 --> 19:49.100
...and seeing that we're behind
the Devils again...

19:49.400 --> 19:50.300
...and again...

19:50.600 --> 19:51.900
...and again...

19:53.000 --> 19:54.200
Lighten up, Dad.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
Sorry.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.900
History is made by winners.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.500
Conquerors.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.400
Barbarians.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.300
Now, I want you to go out there...

20:06.800 --> 20:10.600
...and wipe the ice
with their filthy butts!

20:10.900 --> 20:11.700
All right?!

20:13.200 --> 20:15.000
Play clean.
Have a good game.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.900
Come on, guys.
Let's whup them!

20:20.500 --> 20:21.600
Hey, Rory.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.500
Hey, sweetheart. Miss me?

20:26.100 --> 20:29.300
Let's nail it this time. You're
getting tighter. We're almost there.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
Come on, Charlie!

22:04.000 --> 22:06.300
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.700
- Good luck, Jack.
- Afraid I'm going to need it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.600
- See you Later.
- All right, man. Thanks.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.400
I hope it's not bad.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.400
How bad is it in there?

22:22.300 --> 22:24.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.200
- Something smells good...
- You promised him.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.300
Why'd you go and do that, Jack?

22:46.900 --> 22:51.000
I've told you. If you're not going
to be there, don't say you will be.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.000
You know how I knew you promised him?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.200
He kept Looking at me up in the stands.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.000
And after about the 40th time...

22:57.200 --> 23:00.300
...I realized he expected you
to be there.

23:01.800 --> 23:06.100
I don't care if you get too busy
or you flake out on me.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.700
Well, I care, but I chose it.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.700
I married you. I'll deal with it.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.200
He didn't choose this.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.300
One of these days,
Charlie will score his first goal...

23:16.500 --> 23:19.400
...and you won't see it.
Like you never saw his measles...

23:19.600 --> 23:22.700
...or the time he jammed
Fig Newtons into the projector.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Those things only happen once.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.500
Don't, Jack. You said enough.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.600
Hey, buddy.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.800
How'd you guys do?

23:46.400 --> 23:49.000
Got killed. Eight-zip.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.600
I'm really sorry I didn't make it.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.400
I'm really sorry, man.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.400
Hey, look...

24:13.200 --> 24:15.800
I got to talk to you about something...

24:17.500 --> 24:19.100
...that's really important.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.600
You know how you always wanted to be
the next Wayne Gretzky?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.100
I always had a dream too.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.400
Ever since I was about your age...

24:31.700 --> 24:33.800
...I just really wanted
to be a great musician.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.200
I just wanted to be a real player.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.500
I wanted to make a living
doing what I Love.

24:39.700 --> 24:43.000
And I really want to make
a nice Living for you, me and Mom.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.400
Well, see...

24:45.600 --> 24:47.200
...that might be...

24:47.800 --> 24:49.400
...kind of starting to happen.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.200
That's good, Dad.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
Yeah, it is good.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.200
And it's really, really good
for you to have a dream.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.900
Tricky part here is sometimes...

24:59.100 --> 25:01.200
...if you're not careful, you can...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.900
...I don't know, kind of turn
into kind of a...

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
Selfish jerk?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.600
All right.

25:13.500 --> 25:14.600
Yeah.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.900
So are all musicians really flaky?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.400
Yeah, basically, I think.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.300
All the drummers.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.600
Okay, here's an idea.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.800
I've thought about this one
for a while.

25:33.300 --> 25:36.800
You, me, Mom,
we go to the cabin up at Pine Top.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.500
We have a real Christmas vacation,
just us.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.000
No phone, no TV, no band, nothing.
What do you think?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.500
Really?

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
Will you teach me the J-shot?

25:46.900 --> 25:48.100
I will teach you the J-shot.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.900
Hold on a second. No TV?

25:51.200 --> 25:53.200
Yeah, I know.
I was thinking about that too.

25:53.700 --> 25:54.600
Maybe a Little TV.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.000
Okay, cool.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.400
So, eight-oh...

26:00.700 --> 26:01.600
How bad was it?

26:01.900 --> 26:04.000
I think Coach Gronic popped a vein.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.900
- Here, hon, let me get that bag.
- I forgave you last night.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.000
- Then can you grab one of these?
- Nope.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.100
What's in there, a dead body?

26:15.400 --> 26:18.500
No, it's just, like, Gameboy,
batteries, food, clothes...

26:18.700 --> 26:20.700
We'll only be up there
three days.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.400
We could get snowed in for months.
You'll thank me.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.800
Grab the phone, will you?

26:30.900 --> 26:32.000
Hello?

26:32.300 --> 26:33.800
Yeah, sure, hold on a second.

26:34.000 --> 26:34.800
It's for you.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.100
John Kaplan?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.000
I'll meet you in the car.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.400
I just got this...

26:50.700 --> 26:52.900
...kind of unbelievable phone call.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.200
The record company heard our tape...

26:57.500 --> 26:58.800
...went nuts.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.500
Oh, honey!

27:04.700 --> 27:05.900
Dad, this is awesome!

27:06.200 --> 27:07.300
That's great!

27:07.500 --> 27:09.400
- You think?
- What's the matter?

27:09.700 --> 27:12.500
Well, the head of Asylum
has to see us.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.400
He'll only sign one act.
There's 3 other bands...

27:15.700 --> 27:18.600
...and he'll only sign us
if we go to his party in Aspen.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.600
When?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.000
Tomorrow.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.400
Christmas?

27:24.700 --> 27:25.500
I know.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.500
There's got to be another time
he can see you.

27:28.700 --> 27:31.300
According to Kaplan,
there is no other time. This is it.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.200
Don't worry. Forget about it.
It's too hard, because...

27:34.400 --> 27:35.700
Hold on a second.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.100
I don't even want to go.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.200
Let's see if we can work this out.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.300
I mean, how Long
do you have to play?

27:42.400 --> 27:45.800
I don't know. That's a good point.
Could maybe play a half an hour.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.900
Don't play a whole set. They can tell
how you sound in a few songs.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.000
Get out...

27:51.200 --> 27:53.900
Maybe I could borrow Mac's car.
I could drive back.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.300
That way I could be back
by Christmas night.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.100
But I'll miss Christmas Day for sure.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.300
Here.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.400
What's this?
I gave this to you.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.000
I don't want it.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.800
This is going to be a great gig, man.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.600
We'll rock this guy's house and
blow it apart. He'll have to remodel.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.400
This is the one. I'm telling you.
This is a good thing.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.800
- So when do you want me to pull over?
- Right now. Over here.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.000
What am I, crazy? I got a great wife.
I got a great kid.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.500
I'm not living this life anymore.
I'm going home.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.700
Good.
You're making the right decision.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.200
If they like us now,
they'll like us next week.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.600
It's Christmas.
They can mail us the contract.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.800
- How do I explain this to the guys?
- Are you nuts? Watch this.

29:10.700 --> 29:11.900
Hey, guys.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.700
- The gig's off.
- Thank you, Santa.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.100
Nobody wanted to come. Lou's mom
wants to cook Christmas dinner.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.600
Yes, Merry Christmas, boys.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.500
I'm going to see my family.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.800
This is great! I'll take
the 40 to Highway 2, and then...

29:27.700 --> 29:29.000
Why don't you take the car?

29:29.700 --> 29:31.200
It'd be so much faster that way.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.100
Oh, man!

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
Now, where did he say that spot was?

30:05.200 --> 30:06.400
There it is.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.500
Come on, Mac.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.200
Merry Christmas.
Have a great vacation.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.400
Merry Christmas.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.300
Thanks.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.000
Feet are for walking!

31:20.700 --> 31:23.000
Frost. You big butthead.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.100
Forget it, Rory.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.100
He's no fun to pick on anymore
since his old man died.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
Yeah? Well, it's time
he gets over it.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.000
I never even met my old man.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.400
- Want a lift home?
- No, I'm not going home.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.400
You shouldn't walk in the road.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.300
No one's around. It's all right.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.800
Okay, well, I'll see you tonight.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.400
Why?

31:54.600 --> 31:55.600
I'm baby-sitting.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.800
Well, not baby-sitting.
You're not a baby.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.500
We can hang out
while your mom Christmas shops.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.200
All right.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.900
See you later, Charlie.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.500
Sorry, dude!

32:41.300 --> 32:42.400
Damn it!

32:48.300 --> 32:49.400
Damn it!

33:09.400 --> 33:11.000
I can drive through it.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
I can get it.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.600
Really, it's okay.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.300
No, it's not okay. Hold on.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.700
It's okay. It's okay.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.400
Charlie, it's okay. It's okay.

33:35.400 --> 33:39.100
I miss him too. I miss him too.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.000
It's going to be okay, honey.
I promise.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.700
Here you go.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.200
Thanks.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.199
How you doing, little bear?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.199
Fine.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.199
I'll stay home. We'll hang out.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.400
No, Mom, I'll be fine.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.699
I've done my Christmas shopping.
I'm good.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.500
No, me and Mac'll be fine.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.500
Want a marshmallow?

34:25.900 --> 34:27.199
What do you want? One?

34:28.800 --> 34:29.800
Two?

34:31.199 --> 34:32.300
Maybe four?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.600
Maybe all 500?

34:36.400 --> 34:37.199
Thanks, Mom.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.800
Your dad loved this guy.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.199
They even played together
a couple of times.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.700
Nice to know he had
time for someone.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.900
Come on, Dad, put the head on.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.400
Now, okay, Natalie,
pack some snow in there.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.100
Let's go in the house.
Come on. It's getting cold.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.900
I'm going to get you now.
Gotcha!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.100
I'm home!

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Hey, I'm home.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.900
Man, it's cold!

39:59.100 --> 40:00.200
Could you open up?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.200
Charlie, it's me.
It's Dad!

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Could you get the door?

40:33.400 --> 40:34.200
What?!

40:36.300 --> 40:37.100
No.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.000
No way!

40:53.200 --> 40:54.800
Can't be.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.200
What is that?

41:06.800 --> 41:09.300
Hey! Come on!
That's disgusting!

41:09.900 --> 41:11.300
Chester, it's me.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
It's me. It's Jack!

41:16.500 --> 41:20.000
- Chester just peed on a live snowman!
- No cranberries.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.600
What?

41:21.900 --> 41:23.100
This is not happening.

41:23.700 --> 41:24.800
This cannot be happening!

41:26.300 --> 41:27.300
Can you let me in?

41:28.800 --> 41:29.700
Charlie, look...

41:30.900 --> 41:33.000
I'm having kind of a bad day here.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.500
Come on, Mac.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.000
This ought to do it.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.600
Kiddo, it's getting cold!

41:51.000 --> 41:52.800
That's my branch!

41:54.800 --> 41:55.700
Okay, come on.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.700
Come on. Come on!

41:58.000 --> 41:59.100
This is unbelievable.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.600
When I was a human, nothing.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.700
Now all of a sudden
you want to play?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Come on, Chester...

42:11.100 --> 42:13.400
That's the coldest wedgie
I ever had.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.200
Well, look what we have here.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.100
Let me pick up my...

42:18.300 --> 42:19.100
...arm.

42:26.700 --> 42:27.800
Is that a snowplow?

42:35.100 --> 42:36.400
Excuse me. Hello!

42:36.700 --> 42:39.800
I'm on the front of your plow,
Mr. Snowplow Driver!

42:48.200 --> 42:49.500
Big headache!

43:04.700 --> 43:07.000
Wonderful service.
Thanks for the lift.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.900
Come on, shake it off.
It's just snow.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.400
Great.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.500
Talk about your separation anxiety.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.400
Hey, you!
Ball number two.

43:26.700 --> 43:29.000
Don't just sit there.
Give me a hand.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
Okay, that's it.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.300
Come on, no.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.000
Get the mitten out of my eye.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.300
No, that's my nose.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.200
That's my cork!

43:37.600 --> 43:39.300
There we go.
Got it. Got it.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.400
Now watch it.
Okay, one, two...

43:42.400 --> 43:43.200
...three!

43:44.400 --> 43:45.800
I'm getting dizzy.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.200
Man!

43:51.600 --> 43:52.800
Something's missing.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.800
Nice work, ball number three.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.400
Man, it's bad enough
my ticket got punched...

44:06.800 --> 44:10.100
...but to come back like this!
It's embarrassing.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.800
I've put myself back together
after some rough nights...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.900
...but this is ridiculous.

44:23.900 --> 44:27.200
Don't panic.
Just act real casual.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, just act casual.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.400
Wait a minute. I'm a snowman.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.100
There you go.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.300
Hello there.

44:46.900 --> 44:49.500
Maybe Charlie's snapping out of it.

44:55.700 --> 44:58.000
It's good to see these again.

45:01.800 --> 45:05.300
Let's get you bundled up.
It's going to be a cold one.

45:22.900 --> 45:23.700
Back off!

45:24.000 --> 45:27.300
- What's going on?
- I'm so glad to see you.

45:30.400 --> 45:33.200
Have you been watching
the Sci-Fi Channel again?

45:33.900 --> 45:35.200
Gabby, you're back.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.700
Charlie's been great all evening.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.800
- What happened here?
- I was thinking the same thing.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.100
It's the snowman.

45:42.300 --> 45:44.300
I saw it. Terrific job!

45:44.600 --> 45:46.000
No! Mom, he's alive!

45:47.800 --> 45:49.500
Well, I'd better be going.

45:49.700 --> 45:52.700
Not so fast.
Honey, are you sure you're okay?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.600
I swear, he came to life,
waddled into the street...

45:56.800 --> 45:58.400
...and a snowplow took him away!

46:03.200 --> 46:04.500
Well...

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
...I guess it got a cab back, then.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.300
What?

46:11.600 --> 46:12.600
How...?

46:14.400 --> 46:15.200
Thanks, Mac.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.800
You're welcome.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.400
Good work!

46:38.000 --> 46:38.900
You look good.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.600
Oh, man...

46:44.600 --> 46:46.400
...I never did fix that.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.200
Oh, man, why me?

47:12.600 --> 47:14.300
Why a snowman?

47:15.600 --> 47:18.300
I mean, could the universe
really be that unoriginal?

47:19.200 --> 47:20.600
I don't know.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.700
Is it the name Jack Frost?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.900
Because if that's it,
that's not even clever.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.500
I should accept it.
I'm a frozen freak of nature.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.500
I just want to know why.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.800
I'm just...
Could you just give me...

47:36.900 --> 47:39.800
Could I just have some kind of sign?

47:40.400 --> 47:41.800
What the...?

47:43.900 --> 47:45.700
Well, at least it's not a snowplow.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.600
Sid? Sid Gronic?

47:51.400 --> 47:52.600
Sid, is that you?

47:54.300 --> 47:56.800
Been hearing great things about you.
Seriously.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.800
Sid, come here!
Wait, wait, wait!

48:04.300 --> 48:05.800
Where you going?

48:06.500 --> 48:07.400
Wait.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.700
Thanks for the help, Sid!

48:13.300 --> 48:16.500
All right, wait a minute.
I just have to pull this together.

48:16.900 --> 48:21.200
When I saw my reflection, I denied it.
That was my denial period.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.700
I go off on Sid.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.200
Clearly, I've had my anger period.

48:25.400 --> 48:29.200
That's what they say you do.
First you deny, then you go into anger.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.600
I just have to accept it.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.700
I accept I'm a snowman.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.200
Sid!

48:59.900 --> 49:01.100
All right.

49:01.700 --> 49:02.800
Come on.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.900
Just a regular snowman, huh?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.500
We'll see about that.

49:14.300 --> 49:16.200
Who are you and what do you want?

49:17.100 --> 49:19.100
Talk, or I'll
turn you into a puddle.

49:20.300 --> 49:21.500
I know you're alive.

49:22.300 --> 49:23.800
So you better...

49:24.700 --> 49:25.800
...start...

49:26.400 --> 49:27.800
...talking.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.000
That thing's hot.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.800
What are you doing?
I'm your father.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.200
Okay, you're grounded.

49:34.500 --> 49:35.300
Come here.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.100
Charlie, it's me! Dad!
Honest.

49:38.300 --> 49:40.900
- I can explain everything.
- Get away from me!

49:41.200 --> 49:44.000
I can't explain the part about
me being a snowman, but...

49:49.200 --> 49:50.800
Go pick on someone as dumb as you.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.600
As dumb as me?

49:58.000 --> 49:59.800
- Good one, Rory.
- Give it back!

50:00.100 --> 50:01.300
Spin move.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.300
Right here, right here,
right here.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.000
Oh, look.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.400
It's our little hero.

50:09.700 --> 50:12.500
Don't worry about him anymore.
He's not even in the game.

50:13.800 --> 50:14.900
You're so immature.

50:15.100 --> 50:16.800
Come on, give it back.

50:17.700 --> 50:18.800
Give it back.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.000
Did you guys see that?

50:27.600 --> 50:29.200
So you do want a piece of me.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.200
Thought you learned your lesson.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.200
Kid, how's it going?

50:38.100 --> 50:39.400
What are you doing here?

50:39.800 --> 50:42.300
Guess it's time for a
refresher course.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.100
Okay, snowball fight?

50:49.300 --> 50:52.900
You picked the wrong area
to mess with me, and that's snow.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.300
Three balls, two sticks,
one cork nose. Snowman? No.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.000
Much, much more.
I am the Wizard of Blizzard!

51:08.600 --> 51:11.000
Now run!
Run, you little mountain goats!

51:19.500 --> 51:21.300
Boy, the old Wizard
could use a nap.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.200
I'm out of gas.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.400
Run!

51:26.500 --> 51:27.400
Let's get him!

51:33.900 --> 51:34.800
Hold up.

51:35.700 --> 51:37.500
He's not going anywhere.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.000
Where are you going to go now, Frost?

51:48.600 --> 51:49.400
Be careful!

51:53.900 --> 51:54.700
Help!

51:54.900 --> 51:55.800
Just hold on!

51:57.500 --> 51:59.000
I'm coming. I'm coming!

52:03.600 --> 52:04.700
I'm coming, Charlie!

52:05.300 --> 52:06.500
I can't hold on!

52:08.700 --> 52:10.700
Hold on. I'm coming.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.300
What are you doing?

52:12.600 --> 52:14.500
Don't you worry. I'm coming!

52:19.900 --> 52:21.400
Told you I was coming.

52:24.200 --> 52:27.200
You know, sometimes
it's good to have a big butt.

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
Let's get out of here!

52:32.700 --> 52:33.900
There he is!

52:34.600 --> 52:35.800
Let's get him!

52:37.000 --> 52:39.200
Come on, guys.
Go, go, go!

52:40.400 --> 52:41.200
You steer.

52:41.500 --> 52:42.400
I'll scream.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.200
Do something!

52:49.400 --> 52:50.400
Zap them into ice.

52:50.800 --> 52:54.300
Zap them into ice? Get real!
I don't even have pockets.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.900
Duck, Charlie!

53:10.400 --> 53:11.400
That'll cool him off.

53:13.900 --> 53:14.900
Hold on!

53:15.200 --> 53:16.000
I am holding on.

53:24.900 --> 53:25.800
You the man!

53:26.000 --> 53:27.600
No, you the man.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.700
I'm the snowman.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.200
We're safe!

53:37.000 --> 53:38.400
Okay, we're not safe.

53:40.200 --> 53:41.500
What's going on?

53:42.400 --> 53:43.400
Nothing.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.800
I don't think so.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.600
All right!

54:27.000 --> 54:28.100
Look out!

54:46.000 --> 54:47.100
Time to split.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.600
I'll see you at the bottom.

55:08.200 --> 55:09.700
I slimmed down!

55:14.500 --> 55:15.400
Shredding.

55:18.100 --> 55:19.200
Big air!

55:19.900 --> 55:20.900
Right behind you, Frost.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Pull your vehicle over.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.400
Snowman!

55:29.000 --> 55:30.100
Perfect.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.700
Here we go.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.300
Catch some air, baby!

55:51.500 --> 55:52.800
This is awesome!

55:56.400 --> 55:58.000
Look out.
Look out for the trees!

55:59.000 --> 56:00.800
- Carving time!
- I'm behind you!

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Big carves.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.800
- We were ripping!
- That was cool.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.800
- That was great.
- Did you see that?

56:09.500 --> 56:11.000
One time, thank you.

56:11.200 --> 56:14.000
Did you see me going down?
The nice thing about big...

56:14.200 --> 56:17.000
...balls, excuse me, is look how
you can move around them.

56:17.800 --> 56:19.000
I like the roundedness.

56:19.300 --> 56:22.400
You can throw your weight over
on this side of the board.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.600
- Better than being skinny.
- Hold on.

56:25.700 --> 56:28.500
- You almost got me killed.
- I saved your butt too, pal.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
So I'm supposed to believe
you're my dad?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.900
Do me a favor. Go easy on me.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.100
Because I'm having trouble
dealing with it myself, okay?

56:37.400 --> 56:38.200
You know...

56:38.500 --> 56:39.900
...he died a year ago.

56:40.100 --> 56:41.700
I know. I was there.

56:42.100 --> 56:43.600
You're nuts.

56:44.100 --> 56:46.600
Great. He doesn't believe me.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.500
It's not enough I got...

56:48.700 --> 56:50.900
...these stick arms
and this humongous butt.

56:51.100 --> 56:52.400
And that dippy walk.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.400
What's wrong with my walk?
Is it that bad?

56:55.700 --> 56:57.000
All right.

56:57.400 --> 56:59.100
So you're my dad, huh?

57:00.100 --> 57:01.500
How did my hamster die?

57:02.500 --> 57:04.400
Your hamster? Heart attack.

57:04.700 --> 57:05.800
Vacuum cleaner.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.200
Well, yeah, but...

57:07.400 --> 57:09.800
I'll bet it had a heart attack
on the way in.

57:10.500 --> 57:11.700
All right.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.200
What's my hockey position?

57:13.400 --> 57:15.100
That's easy. Right wing.

57:15.400 --> 57:17.200
- Wrong.
- What? You're a wing.

57:17.400 --> 57:19.300
They moved me to defense last year.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.900
Oh, man, Charlie-boy.

57:21.200 --> 57:24.500
I'm sorry. Defense is a good position,
but you're a natural winger.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.300
Hold on.
What'd you call me?

57:28.200 --> 57:29.300
I said...

57:30.200 --> 57:31.200
..."Charlie-boy".

57:31.900 --> 57:34.600
That's what I always call you.
Charlie-boy.

57:36.000 --> 57:36.800
Dad?

57:40.300 --> 57:41.200
Dad!

57:44.700 --> 57:47.900
It is me, Charlie.
I'm back.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.600
Hold on.
This is really weird.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.600
I just hugged a snowman.

57:55.900 --> 57:57.900
You played on the magic harmonica.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.100
What? Magic harmonica?

58:00.800 --> 58:01.900
I thought you made that up!

58:02.100 --> 58:03.600
So did I.

58:04.800 --> 58:05.800
You know what?

58:06.200 --> 58:07.800
Let's go home and talk, okay?

58:08.200 --> 58:11.300
You know, catch up on stuff.
And you know something?

58:11.900 --> 58:13.100
I'm hungry.

58:15.400 --> 58:18.500
Boy, your mom is going to be jazzed
we fixed that sink.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.100
Snow peas.
You should like these.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.000
Level with me. How is she?

58:24.200 --> 58:25.000
She's good.

58:25.400 --> 58:28.000
She moved a picture
of you next to her bed.

58:37.700 --> 58:38.600
What's that?

58:38.800 --> 58:39.800
Mom's home.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.900
She can't be!
She can't see me like this!

58:42.100 --> 58:44.500
Nobody can see me like this,
but especially her.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.500
Just a minute, Mom!

58:58.000 --> 59:00.600
Honey, why are all the windows open?

59:00.900 --> 59:02.200
Please, you gotta help me.

59:02.500 --> 59:04.100
It's freezing in here.

59:09.900 --> 59:11.400
Charlie, what's going on?

59:12.200 --> 59:13.200
Science fair project.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.800
You're kidding.

59:15.800 --> 59:16.800
Why is the floor wet?

59:17.100 --> 59:19.000
Well, the science fair project...

59:19.300 --> 59:21.900
...it's about what it's like
to live in an igloo.

59:22.200 --> 59:25.700
And Eskimos have
wet floors, Mom. Duh.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.800
It's freezing in here.
What's going on?

59:34.500 --> 59:36.100
And what's with all the food?

59:36.300 --> 59:37.400
I got kind of hungry.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.400
Three bags of veggies?

59:39.800 --> 59:41.000
I got real hungry?

59:42.800 --> 59:43.600
What?

59:46.200 --> 59:48.400
There's something I need to tell you.

59:48.700 --> 59:49.500
Well?

59:49.700 --> 59:51.000
This science fair thing?

59:51.500 --> 59:52.800
It was Natalie's idea.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.700
Okay. Just tell Natalie
the next experiment's at her house.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.300
Grab some towels and help me
with this, okay?

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.200
I think I need a day off.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.600
Frosty the Snowman

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.900
Had to hurry on his way

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.100
But he waved goodbye

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.400
Saying, "Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some..."

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.900
You said the snowman spoke to you?

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.500
Yes, he did.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.800
And he knew my name.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.400
Were there any other witnesses?

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.800
There wasn't any other witnesses.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.800
In the Rocky Mountain states...

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.300
...folks may not be in for
a white Christmas after all.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.700
Charlie, honey,
did you fix the sink?

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.600
Why is the snowman facing this way?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.300
I turned him...

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.000
...to even out his tan.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.800
Was that Sid I heard talking on TV?

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.300
What was he talking about?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.400
Nothing, really.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.600
I saw him yesterday at the bank...

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.600
...and he told me
that you quit the team.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.800
Charlie, you didn't tell me.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.100
You want to talk?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.100
About what?

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:58.600
I don't know.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.600
This hockey thing...

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.600
...or how you're doing in school.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.500
You tell me.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.200
I'm trying to watch the weather.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.900
Gabby, it'll be all right.
I'm here now.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.800
Well...

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.300
...sort of.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.700
Oh, boy.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.300
I invented the backdoor escape,
okay? What's up?

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.100
Since you showed up, Mom thinks
I'm nuts, Rory Buck wants to kill me...

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.300
...and I'm pretty sure
my dad's a snowman.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.200
So what's the problem?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.800
I know yesterday was a rough day.
Things'll get better.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.200
Quit following me.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.700
You're a snowman!

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.800
People will see you and cut you up
into ice cube trays.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.400
If that's the danger of hanging out
with you, I'll take the chance.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.500
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.200
Really fine.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.800
Fine as wine...

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.400
What?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.300
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.000
I think we look kind of...

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.800
...you know, cute.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.500
Somebody's going to hear you.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.000
Check it out.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.500
What's up with that?

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.600
Dude, he ditched us for a snowman.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.400
I saw on the Geology Channel...

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.100
...they can actually turn pine cones
into a homemade explosive device.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.100
How's your science
project coming?

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.200
What science project?

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.900
- The one about what it's like...
- Isn't that Charlie?

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.200
Hey, Mac.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.700
Finally come in for
some Christmas lights?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.400
I need a cup of that house paint
you call coffee.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.200
You got it.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.400
So what's going on?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.400
Know when I promised not to bother
you for any talks with Charlie?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.900
I lied.
I need you to talk to Charlie.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.400
Nobody knows about this place.
I come here to think.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Well, it's really cool.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.800
I've been here a lot this year.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.400
You know, Dad, I'm sorry
I gave you back the harmonica.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.900
Don't worry about it.
You were mad. I'd be mad too.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.600
Can I ask you why you
quit playing hockey?

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.200
- Hockey's not that great.
- Yeah, right.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.100
The last person you see every night
is Wayne Gretzky on your wall.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.900
Tell you what. We're here.
Let's work on the J-shot.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.200
I don't think so.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.800
I see. It's like that.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.600
Looks like I'm working
out by myself...

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.000
...even though I haven't
played hockey in...

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
...a year.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.000
I'll find a rock to use as a puck,
seeing as I'll be playing...

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.000
...all alone.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.500
All right, all right, I'll skate.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.700
Just stop bellyaching.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.000
We'll get our nice balance.
We'll get set up.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.500
Man, this was a lot easier
when I had legs.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.600
We're going to stay nice and relaxed.
Real loose.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.400
We come through. We snap our wrist.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.800
Just before we do that...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.900
...I make this little move here.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.200
That goalie could sue me
for whiplash.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.900
That's pretty cool.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.800
A little thing I call the J-shot.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.600
Now, let's play some hockey.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.700
Are you looking for the power?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.100
Then bring it, son.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.900
That's a J-shot, dude!

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.000
- I did it!
- That's you! That's all you!

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.400
But I didn't score.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.200
Life is full of setbacks.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.800
Look at me.
I'm a snowdrift with arms.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.800
You can give up, or you can
keep firing the puck, bud.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200
What do you think?

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.100
All right, give me the puck.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.300
There's a lot of wood!

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.000
Fakes left, fakes right.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.700
Man, nice shot. All right!

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.500
You got the...

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.500
All right!

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.500
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.300
I think you got the J-shot.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.700
I think you got the J-shot down.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.800
All right, come on.
Let's go home.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.200
Come on, come on.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400
You played great.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.300
Thanks for teaching me the J-shot.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.300
I want to see you use it.
You got to get back on the team.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.900
- No, I don't think so.
- I do.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.800
You're letting your friends
and yourself down.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.800
- But wait a second...
- No "buts".

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.400
Let's talk about schoolwork.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.800
What about it?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I saw your report card.
You've got serious jamming to do.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.100
What's this, a lecture?
Now you're giving me a lecture?

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.400
See? It's kind of scary.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.800
Think how the snowman must feel.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.000
And I'm worried about your mom.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.700
- Why?
- Has she hung any Christmas lights?

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.000
Not a lot.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.600
Yeah, I know. Hardly any.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.399
Why are you telling me this?

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.399
You've got responsibilities now.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.200
You'll just have to face them.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.000
You got to watch out for Mom...

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.399
...and straighten things out
with your friends.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.899
I'm only 1 2 years old.
I can't take all this!

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.300
I might have pushed it
a smidge too hard.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.000
Hey, hon.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.500
I'm heading to the Shiverfest.
You want to come along?

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.600
No, thanks.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.399
Or if you'd rather,
you can come with me.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.200
I'm going to go caroling with
Mrs. Wilkins and the neighbor ladies.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.899
They did a good job this year.
Do you like the tree?

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.899
Want a balloon or anything?

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.600
Or pretzels? They've got...

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.500
Wow! Check out these snowmen.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:25.000
Finals of the father-son snowman
building contest begin in 5 minutes.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.600
Five minutes.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.399
Mom thinks I'm going nuts, doesn't she?

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.000
No, no, no.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:35.100
She's just a little concerned,
that's all.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:39.700
So...

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:40.899
...what's going on?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.399
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.400
Come on, let's check out the band.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.300
Talk about a tough gig.
It's freezing out here.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.200
Why don't you play music anymore?

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.200
I kind of lost the groove.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.800
The groove?

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.000
Playing with your dad, I never
thought about what music was.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.400
Music was life. It was...

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.600
...just...

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.400
...like breathing, really.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.700
So natural.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.900
After he died...

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.000
...music became...

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.600
...a job.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.400
You know, Jack always said to me:

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.200
"It should never feel like work".

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.800
He was your best friend, huh?

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.300
Your dad was the real deal.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.800
Do you think he wanted me
to be a musician?

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.900
More than anything, he wanted you to be
whatever you wanted to be.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.300
He didn't care what that was.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.500
Just whatever made you happy.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.600
Really?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.200
Really.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.000
Think you'll get the groove back?

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.500
Someday, maybe.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.000
I hope so.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.600
Man, you got your shopping done, folks?

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.800
You got 10 hours till Christmas Eve...

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.200
...and it's already 55 degrees.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.000
Could get up to 70 today.

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.500
Snowplow drivers got a day off.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.500
It's hot enough to melt a snowman.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.100
Although, you know,
good news for Sid Gronic.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.200
Speaking of hot,
here's a little Billy Idol for you.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.700
"Hot in the City"
on central Colorado's classic rock.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.400
Hey, man. Good morning.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.000
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what you said.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.100
You're right.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.800
The J-shot,
it wasn't just about hockey, was it?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.300
What do you think?

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.400
There's something I got to do.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.100
Hey, guys.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.400
Hey, Coach.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.400
I'd like to get back on the team.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:54.800
What?

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.000
You ditched us, Charlie.
Remember?

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.800
Do we have to bring
your snowman buddy along too?

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.300
There'll be no mention of snowmen
in this car.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I don't know, Charlie.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.600
Well, I do.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.300
I say we let him back on the team.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.000
Everybody deserves a second chance.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.800
Go get your stuff.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.400
Go, Charlie!

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.600
They let me back on the team.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.000
Listen, Dad, about last night, I...

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.500
It's okay, buddy.
What time they drop the puck?

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.200
- 1 1 :30. But you don't got to come.
- I know that.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.000
He's talking to the snowman again.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.300
What'd I say, Tuck?

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.800
Shake it, Charlie!

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.600
Remember...

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.700
...arms and wrists.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.400
Straight but relaxed.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.000
Thanks again, Dad.
See you after the game.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.900
Man, this sun is brutal.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.200
I mean, I am literally
melting my ass off.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.800
I didn't come
all the way from the hereafter...

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.200
...to miss another one
of my kid's hockey games.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.000
Chet, listen.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.600
Chet, I know
we've had our differences...

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.100
...but I got a game to catch.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.000
I really could use your help.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.600
So how are we going to do this?

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.800
Go. Yes, Frost!

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.200
He's good.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.600
Come on, okay. Here we go.
Come on.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.000
Maybe you got some friends
who are Huskies.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.100
You know a Saint Bernard?

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.100
Score! One-nothing.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.900
And here we go again.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.900
That's right, Chet.
Take your time.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.900
Wonder if there's gonna be any
cute poodles there.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.000
That's what I thought!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.400
Good pass, Charlie!

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.100
Go, Spencer! Go!

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:51.800
He scored!

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.400
Score by Spencer Jordan,
with an assist by Charlie Frost.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.200
Mountaineers, one.
Devils, one.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.200
Okay, so far, so good.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.500
Stay cool.

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.200
Almost there.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.200
All right, Frost!

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.600
Get it back!

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.600
Go, Charlie. Go!

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.500
Yes, Frost. Go!

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.200
One hundred yards
of piping-hot asphalt.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.800
Bad day to be a snowman.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.800
This could really sting.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.700
Okay, baby steps, baby steps.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.100
Man, this is getting hot.
This is hot.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.900
This is hot on my tootsies.
My tootsies is burning.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.700
Holy habanero!

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.100
This is hot.
Let's speed her up!

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.300
Leaping Lawrence of Arabia!

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.300
I am so hot!

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.700
All right, all right, Frost!

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.800
All right, Charlie!

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.200
Turn it around!

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.000
Frost, yes, go!

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.200
The J-shot, Charlie-boy, come on!

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.900
Arms and wrists.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.000
Straight but relaxed.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.100
Nice going, butthead!

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.500
Outstanding! Yes!

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.100
My man! Yes!

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.400
You got the power!

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.600
Way to go, Charlie.

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.600
The ice is now open
for all free skates.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.900
Outstanding game.
What can I say?

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200
You rock, dude.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.800
You're melting.
You gotta be crazy to come here.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.200
I couldn't miss your big game.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.100
Let's get you on the ice
so you can cool off.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.000
That's not going to work.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.800
I got to get you someplace cold.
I won't lose you again.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.400
I'll be back!

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.800
Someplace cold.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.400
Mom?

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.000
No cutting!

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.800
It's okay, ma'am.
He's my son.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.100
You need to drive us somewhere
right now.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.500
- Honey, I'm working.
- You've got to!

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:08.500
What's wrong?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.200
- He's melting.
- Who's melting?

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.500
The snowman's melting.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.000
That's just the way it is.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.600
If you drive us to the mountains,
he won't melt.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.100
I'm not driving you
and your snowman anywhere.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.400
I know this has been hard for you.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.300
You don't understand, Mom.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.200
Dad's the snowman.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.300
What?

01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.100
I'm sorry, but he made me promise
not to tell you.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.700
Honey, he died a year ago.

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.500
You'll just have to accept that.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.700
No, Mom, you don't understand.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.700
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.800
Do me a favor.
Watch out for snowplows.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.600
Charlie's run away with the snowman.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.400
Really.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.500
Oh, my!

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.100
Look out! Move, move!

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.700
Excuse me. Look out.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.300
- He could be anywhere.
- Mac, it's a kid and a snowman.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.700
You and me.
Once and for all.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.800
I'll fight you any other time.
Just not now.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.600
I don't know who's more stupider,
you or your snowman.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.000
Excuse me.
Did you just say "stupider"?

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.200
What kind of word is "stupider"?

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.000
Who said that?

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.500
I did...

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.000
...you little baggy-pants snow punk.

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.800
What the heck is it?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.600
Not what. Who.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.100
And he's my dad.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.200
I knew it!

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.000
Mitch and Pudge thought I was crazy.
But I saw you that day.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.800
You throw a mean snowball.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.200
Okay, okay, okay.
Just chill, kid.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.700
Don't have a meltdown.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.700
Look, Rory,
it's too hot down here.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.200
If I don't get him up to
the mountains, I'll lose him.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.700
He does look pretty bad.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.100
Come on.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.900
You know what it's like
not to have a dad.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.100
It sucks.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.700
It sucks big time.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.500
All right.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.700
Snowdad's better than no dad.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Let's go.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.000
Come on.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.600
Come on, let's go!

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.200
That was good.
Merry Christmas.

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:42.800
Come on.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.600
- Good Luck, Charlie!
- Thanks!

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.200
Okay, what's the snowman look like?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.600
Like a snowman.
He looks like a snowman.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.200
Three balls, two stick arms,
a cute cork nose.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.000
What do you think he looks like?

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.500
I'm trying to do my job, that's all.
Can you help me?

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.400
Five-eight.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.600
White.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Caucasian.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.400
Stocky. He's sort of well-built.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.200
I'd say 500, 550 pounds.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.700
Could you estimate an age?

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.600
We're here!

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.400
Ready? On three.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.700
I'm with you, buddy.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.400
One...

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.500
...two...

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.600
...three!

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.000
Fresh powder. My favorite!

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.200
My balls are freezing.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.600
I never thought I'd say that
with a smile.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.000
Come on, Dad, let's go.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.100
Let's go get you warmed up, buddy.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.200
I was so busy trying to make my mark
on the world, I didn't...

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.500
You are my mark on the world.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.200
Did you find him?

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400
Charlie's sleeping.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.100
He had one heck of a day.

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.100
Who is this?

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.000
Where's Charlie?

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.400
He's right here at the cabin.

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.700
Why don't you come get him?

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.900
Jack?

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.400
It's Christmas!

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.700
Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.500
Merry Christmas to you, bud.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.500
You know what?

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.200
I think this is
the best Christmas I ever had.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.800
You know that night you came back?
It was because of your harmonica.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:26:59.900
I wished it.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.800
I wished you would be here
for Christmas.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.100
Thanks for giving me a second chance
to be your dad.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.200
Now, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.200
It's time for me to go.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.700
What?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.200
No. I'm not going to let you.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.700
You've got to get on with your life.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.700
No, come on.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.900
It'll get cold again, Dad.
You'll see.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.800
Winter's just barely started.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.200
And when it gets warm?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.500
We'll go to South America.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.200
Summer here is winter there.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.500
What about Mom?
Mom needs you.

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.100
What if I need you?

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.600
I will always be there.
I promise.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.200
As long as you hold someone
in your heart...

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.900
...you can never lose them.
Ever.

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.700
You let me back into your heart,
and that took real courage.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.200
You did it. And if you can
do that, you can do anything.

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.500
I'm so proud of you.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.000
If you ever need me,
I'll be right here.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.900
You just call me.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:01.800
Here.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.200
I love you, Dad.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.200
I love you, Charlie.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.500
You're gonna be a good man.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.700
Okay now, let me go.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.800
Oh, honey!

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.600
- I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
- It's okay.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.600
Oh, my God!

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.100
You look so...

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.100
You look so great.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.400
Sing me a smile, Jack.

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.600
Every time

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.900
We say goodbye I cry a little

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.700
I love you so much, Gab.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.100
I love you too, Jack.

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.200
Goodbye.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.400
Goodbye, Jack.

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.500
Charlie-boy...

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.000
...we had us a time, didn't we?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.200
Yeah, we did.

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:34.000
Love you.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Bye, Dad.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.000
Goodbye.

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:40.900
Bye.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.000
I will always hear you.
