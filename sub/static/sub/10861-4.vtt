16:10.040 --> 16:12.560
Where did they come from? 
 Aw, geez!

16:12.560 --> 16:14.840
If Gramps were here, 
 he'd know what to do.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.120
Dougie, enough!

16:16.120 --> 16:18.640
What if my parents find out 
 what happened a Miss Clove's?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.960
I'l be grounded for life.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.040
They're not going to find out. 
 It's over!

16:22.040 --> 16:24.240
I say we take this back 
 to Miss Clove's and apologize.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.840
Then I cantell my folks 
 we did the right thing.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.320
Forget it! 
 No one is telling nobody nothing!

16:29.320 --> 16:32.200
- But my folks! 
 - "But my folks!"

16:32.200 --> 16:35.480
I wish you'd just lose your folks. 
 Aah!

16:37.160 --> 16:39.200
It moved, didn't it?

16:39.200 --> 16:42.720
- No, no. It's just-- 
 - You made a wish!

16:42.720 --> 16:45.160
- No, I didn't. 
 - You wished I'd lose my folks.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.640
- Yeah, but-- 
 - [RING]

16:50.320 --> 16:54.120
- Don't answer it. 
 - [RING]

16:56.000 --> 16:59.360
- [RING] 
 - Hello?

16:59.360 --> 17:02.400
- [MAN] Is this Douglas Freeman? 
 - Yes.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.160
This is Lieutenant Carruthers 
 from the Cooper City Police.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.280
I have some bad news for you, son.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.040
Your parents have been 
 in a car accident.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.800
They've been taken 
 to the hospital--

17:09.800 --> 17:11.800
- No! 
 - Who was that?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.520
Mom and Dad had an accient.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.319
They're in the hospital. 
 It was the wish!

17:15.319 --> 17:17.040
No way!

17:17.040 --> 17:20.119
It was! You wished it!

17:20.119 --> 17:24.280
- Then wish for them to be OK. 
 - Yeah! No.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.800
Every time we make a wish, 
 something bad happens.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.760
- Then do something! 
 - I wish Gramps were here.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.720
He'd know what to do. 
 Aah!

17:35.600 --> 17:40.960
Dougie, your grandfather's dead. 
 You don't think...

17:40.960 --> 17:43.280
[CAR HORN HONKS TWICE]

18:05.080 --> 18:07.040
That's Gramps' car. 
 It's him!

18:07.040 --> 18:10.880
No! 
 I don't want to meet no ghost!

18:10.880 --> 18:12.920
We got to wish it away!

18:12.920 --> 18:15.800
- No! 
 - Where is it?

18:15.800 --> 18:19.240
- I wish-- 
 - The wishes are bad!

18:24.760 --> 18:29.000
Dougie, he's dead! 
 He may be a skeleton or rotten.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Uh! Get off!

18:34.800 --> 18:36.080
Uhh!

18:36.080 --> 18:39.160
I got one wish left, 
 and I ain't meeting no ghost!

18:39.160 --> 18:41.600
You can't! 
 That's the wrong way.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.400
Uhh!

18:49.120 --> 18:50.960
Get off!

18:53.000 --> 18:56.280
- [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 - Oh, man!

18:59.240 --> 19:01.400
Wish it away, Dougie, please!

19:01.400 --> 19:05.200
No. I'm going to make the wish 
 we should have made from the start.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.320
We're sorry we broke 
 Miss Clove's vase,

19:07.320 --> 19:10.200
and we wish 
 it never, ever happened.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.320
Whoa! Whoa!

19:15.320 --> 19:17.800
[DOORBELL RINGS]

19:18.680 --> 19:21.880
- Don't answer it. 
 - I got to.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.240
[DOORBELL RINGS]

19:54.680 --> 19:57.080
Sorry. 
 We forot our keys.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.840
Again.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.760
If I didn't take them, 
 they wouldn't get taken.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.440
Hi, Kev.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.320
So... you guys are OK? 
 Nothing happened?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.120
We only went over 
 to the Morrisons'.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.040
Apart from that maniac truck 
 driver that almost sideswiped us.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.400
- Oh, it wasn't that dramatic. 
 - Whoa! What's this for?

20:16.400 --> 20:20.840
- I'm just glad to see you. 
 - We're glad to see you, too.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.400
Hang out, guys.

20:22.400 --> 20:26.040
I say we raid the fridge 
 for some ice cream.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.280
The car.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.440
It's gone.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.840
I don't get it.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.280
Wait.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.280
How did that happen?

20:54.280 --> 20:56.440
Check your pockets.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.960
My medal's gone! 
 Where did it go?

20:59.960 --> 21:02.520
- Bostick's got it. 
 - Say what?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.160
He's got it. 
 He won the race

21:04.160 --> 21:07.800
just like he was supposed to, 
 and there never was a ghost car,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.320
- and those tough guys never chased us. 
 - What do you mean?

21:10.320 --> 21:14.680
I finally made the right wish. 
 None of it ever happened.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.120
[DOORBELL RINGS]

21:19.280 --> 21:22.240
Are you sure 
 the car was gone?

21:42.120 --> 21:44.160
What does it say?

21:44.160 --> 21:48.360
It says "Trick or treat!"

21:50.520 --> 21:55.280
[DAVID] All they could hear 
 was the sound of the wind

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
blowing through the trees.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.320
[FAINT EVIL LAUGHTER]

21:59.320 --> 22:03.240
Or was it the cackle 
 of a sly witch?

22:03.240 --> 22:07.280
[WOMAN] 
 Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

22:07.280 --> 22:09.520
[CLANG]

22:10.360 --> 22:11.320
The End.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.200
I declare this meeting 
 of the Midnight Society closed.
