BY THE END OF THE WEEK,

39:35.974 --> 39:38.544
OR YOU WILL FIND
THE POLICE AT HIS DOOR,

39:38.577 --> 39:41.780
AND YOUR SON, YOUNG AS HE IS,
WITH A RECORD AS A SEX OFFENDER.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.416
I'LL KEEP THIS.

39:44.450 --> 39:47.919
PULL RANK ON ME,
TRY TO HURT
MY HUSBAND'S CAREER,

39:47.953 --> 39:50.355
I'LL MAKE SURE NOT ONLY
THAT YOUR SON NEVER
GETS INTO WEST POINT,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.825
BUT THAT HE SPENDS
THE REST OF HIS LIFE
WEARING AN ANKLE BRACELET.

40:03.134 --> 40:06.738
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I AM SO GRATEFUL.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.575
NINA TOLD ME
HOW YOU LOOKED AFTER HER.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.544
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS A--
SHE WAS A BIG HELP TO US.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.581
WITHOUT HER, WE MIGHT NOT
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESCUE
EVERYONE THAT WE DID.

40:15.614 --> 40:19.485
REALLY?
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS ONE.
SHE'LL FOOL YA.

40:19.518 --> 40:24.289
I DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT MUCH.
ALL I DID WAS GET SICK.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.991
UH, YEAH.
BUT YOU DID IT ON CUE.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.263
- AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?
- CAN WE JUST GO HOME NOW?

40:34.533 --> 40:36.468
THANK YOU AGAIN.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.940
YOU FORGOT THESE.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.943
HEY. THANKS.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.345
YOU GONNA PUT
THOSE ON, OR--

40:47.378 --> 40:50.816
NO, I-I HAVE NO FURTHER
USE FOR THEM.

40:50.849 --> 40:55.186
WELL, THEY ARE A LITTLE TOO,
UM, CLARK KENT FOR YOU.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.359
I--

41:04.630 --> 41:07.499
I'M VERY HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

41:07.533 --> 41:10.201
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:12.370 --> 41:15.406
UH-- HOW'D THEY TEACH YOU
NOT TO GET SO SCARED?

41:17.576 --> 41:20.612
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING MY JOB
TO BE SCARED.

41:20.646 --> 41:24.282
IT'D ACTUALLY BE WORSE FOR ME
IF I WAS IN HIS POSITION.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.619
TOO MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS.
ALL THOSE AWFUL POSSIBILITIES.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.155
MMM. NOW YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE THE MATH TEACHER.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.659
NO. JUST A DAD.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.176
UH, LISSY, GO INSIDE.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.316
THE PICTURE OF LISSY--
YOU FOUND IT?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.719
I FOUND IT, YES.

42:00.752 --> 42:04.756
UH, THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN
IN YOUR HOUSE.

42:04.790 --> 42:09.360
THIS BOY WAS UNDRESSING
MY DAUGHTER AND TAKING A PICTURE
OF HER INSIDE YOUR HOUSE.

42:09.394 --> 42:12.230
WOULD YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

42:16.234 --> 42:18.704
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PHOTO.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.739
BUT YOU KNEW THEY WERE IN THERE.
YOU GAVE THEM A PLACE TO--
NO.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.741
- YOU DIDN'T?
- NO.

42:23.942 --> 42:28.513
OKAY. LET'S START AGAIN.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.684
UH, DID YOU ALLOW
THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER
INSIDE YOUR HOUSE?

42:32.718 --> 42:35.787
YES, WHEN I WAS THERE.

42:35.821 --> 42:38.256
THEY CAME BACK LATER
WHEN I WASN'T THERE. MY KEY--

42:38.289 --> 42:41.126
- YOU GAVE THEM FREE REIN
WITHOUT TELLING ME.
- NO. I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT--

42:41.159 --> 42:43.729
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

42:43.762 --> 42:48.266
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
BROKE INTO MY HOUSE.

42:48.299 --> 42:53.304
TO BE WITH THIS BOY,
SHE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE.

42:53.338 --> 42:57.108
SO THIS DAVID BOY
THINKS SHE'S A WHORE, BUT YOU
JUST THINK SHE'S A THIEF?

42:57.142 --> 42:59.911
- NO. I JUST--
- YOU GET TO BE COOL AUNT KIM,
BUT I'M THE ONE...

42:59.945 --> 43:03.314
THAT NEEDS TO TAKE HER TO
A DOCTOR NOW AND GET HER TESTED
FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT!

43:03.348 --> 43:07.152
- IT DIDN'T GO THAT FAR.
- OH. WELL, SINCE YOU'RE SO
INFORMED, HOW FAR DID IT GO?

43:07.185 --> 43:09.220
I CAME HOME
AND I INTERRUPTED THEM.

43:09.254 --> 43:12.057
- THEY WERE ONLY AS FAR
AS WHAT WAS IN THE PICTURE.
- YES.

43:12.090 --> 43:17.796
SO YOU KNEW THIS BOY
HAD MY DAUGHTER'S SHIRT OFF
INSIDE YOUR HOUSE,

43:17.829 --> 43:21.266
AND YOU DIDN'T CONSIDER THAT
RELEVANT INFORMATION
TO SHARE WITH ME?

43:22.300 --> 43:24.736
NO, I DID NOT.

43:24.770 --> 43:27.172
SAY THAT AGAIN.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.409
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BEST.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.781
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS BEST
TO TEACH HER TO SNEAK AROUND
AND LET A BOY VIOLATE HER?

43:35.814 --> 43:40.786
I, YOU MAY REMEMBER,
DISCOVERED YOUR DAUGHTER
BAWLING LAST YEAR.

43:40.819 --> 43:43.822
WHY?
BECAUSE SHE FOUND A PICTURE
OF HER MOTHER--

43:43.855 --> 43:46.692
THE CONCERNED,
SELF-RIGHTEOUS MOTHER--
HALF-NAKED,

43:46.725 --> 43:49.160
CAVORTING
WITH HER FATHER'S BOSS.

43:49.194 --> 43:52.998
AND SO WHERE DID SHE LEARN
ALL OF THIS SEXUAL ABANDON,
DO YOU THINK?

43:53.031 --> 43:55.834
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT
BEFORE YOU START
ACCUSING ME?

43:55.867 --> 44:01.106
BECAUSE I'M FAIRLY SQUARED AWAY
ABOUT WHAT GOES WHERE AND UNDER
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES.

44:01.139 --> 44:05.877
BUT MAYBE YOU NEED
A LITTLE HELP AT YOUR HOUSE.
THAT BE THE CASE?

44:11.516 --> 44:13.852
GOOD-BYE.
