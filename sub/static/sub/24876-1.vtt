They found something..

08:26.840 --> 08:28.331
Oh, they didn't have
any palm oil

You've got
a businessman's face.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.493
I'd rather have
his wallet.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.455
What are these?

12:39.008 --> 12:41.751
Oh, herbs.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.878
Ooh! Huh.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.677
My mum used to buy those
basil plants in a pot.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.222
- Ocimum basilicum.
- Hm.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.685

keep going black.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.729
I think she just likes
the smell of it

12:54.732 --> 12:55.939
on her fingers.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.606
Your mum's probably got
a touch of black spot.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.484
Uh, it's easier to grow
basil from the seed.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.655

the equator.

this climate very much.

find any cranberry

use blackcurrant.

You haven't had
a proper drink all night.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.804

is it?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.272
No, it's just..

14:19.275 --> 14:21.562
- No.
- What?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.606
Sends me off.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.730
Where to?

14:25.740 --> 14:28.073
I don't know,
somewhere else.

Have you got any music?
iPod or somethin'?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.919
You got a radio?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.458
Oh, that sets
the neighbor's dog off.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.922
Aah, that's his problem.

14:43.925 --> 14:44.841
Well, he's
pretty aggressive.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.003
What sort of dog is it?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.091
No, I didn't mean
the dog.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.757
[laughing]

14:53.226 --> 14:56.139
- Where's your dog anyway?
- I haven't got a dog.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.681
You said you had a dog.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.522
- I don't get along with dogs.
- On your profile.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.643
You said that
you were an animal lover.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.610
Well, animals are okay.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.448
So what else have you
lied about then?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.942
No, no, it's was just..

15:11.953 --> 15:13.819
[laughs]

15:13.830 --> 15:16.368
You look at other people's
profiles, you..

haven't you?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.918
How many girls have you
bought back here then?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.833

make you?

Ahh!

55:58.438 --> 55:59.679
Oh!

55:59.690 --> 56:03.229
My foot.
You've broken my foot.

56:03.235 --> 56:05.227
- Out!
- Don't.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.570
No, Carl, I don't..

56:07.573 --> 56:09.986
Uh, I don't
deserve this.

56:09.992 --> 56:11.028
I don't deserve this!

56:11.034 --> 56:12.320
Out!

56:14.413 --> 56:16.029

Carl.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.165
Carl.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.268
Before you say it
I'm leaving now.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.937
You look like a clown.

57:28.654 --> 57:31.192
I've got an
appointment..

57:31.198 --> 57:32.780
...someone special.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.239
I wouldn't think
anyone's that desperate.

57:37.245 --> 57:39.157
[sighs]

57:40.082 --> 57:41.744
Not like that.

57:45.671 --> 57:47.333
There hasn't
been anyone..

57:49.758 --> 57:51.545
...not since
you went away.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.720
What do I care?

58:07.275 --> 58:08.811
I've got my own
to think of now.

58:19.454 --> 58:21.286
[coughing]

58:28.880 --> 58:30.371
A girlfriend?

58:32.801 --> 58:35.669
- And one on the way.
- Mm.

58:35.679 --> 58:37.591
I'm happy for you.

58:39.391 --> 58:41.428
Maybe I should
take you both out.

58:42.728 --> 58:43.969
My treat.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.766
It's a bit late
for that.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.435
I told her
you were dead.

58:53.321 --> 58:55.608
I'll pick my
case up later

58:55.615 --> 58:56.822
when you're not here.

58:58.785 --> 58:59.785
That's alright?

Carl?

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.122
Is everything okay?

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.825
Oh, she didn't turn up.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.077
Then that wasn't you and Kitty-Kat
that passed here last night?

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:34.329
No, I was
in all evening.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.251
And you didn't hear all
that banging and bashing

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.749
in front of the door
early this morning?

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.216
This morning?

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.755
When I came down,
they'd gone.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.048
I'll be late for work.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.760

Hello, Carl.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.971
Maureen.

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:29.513
I was wondering if you were
around late last night.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.055
No.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.224
Uh, it's just one of the clients
said she saw someone

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.473
moving about
in the roses.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:38.191
Oh. A fox?

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:39.777
No, she swears
it was a man.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:44.983
[chuckles]

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.958
I was thinking, it's probably best
if we keep the key

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:01.253
to the side door
in the office from now on.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.046
Just to be
on the safe side.

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.388
[music continues]

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:28.943
<i>Why are you still here?</i>

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.620
Who said you
could smoke?

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.617
Will you sit down, Carl?

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.334
I've something
to tell you.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.090
What?

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:46.385
A new beginning, I hope.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.258
<i>Might take a few days
to clear.</i>

01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.849
I won it..

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.521
...on the lottery.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.946
I want us to make up.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.239
[sighs]

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:17.459
<i>I was thinking.</i>

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.708
I might go and visit
my sister in Canada.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.257
We've started
talking again.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:30.505
Do you remember
your cousin, Casper?

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:33.474
<i>[scoffs]
You once made a pact</i>

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:37.265
you would do down Niagara Falls
in a wooden barrel.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:38.729
Remember?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.438
Used to obsess you,
those men in barrels.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.529
Forever hiding
yourself away

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.364
<i>in small spaces.</i>

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.246

the falls," you'd say.</i>

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.796
<i>I doubt you'd both
get in one now.</i>

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.926
We could even

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.510
go first class.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:13.385
An adventure.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.895
<i>Is there no way
to start again?</i>

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.810
<i>After all this time.</i>

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.520
But I haven't
had any time.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:31.778
All my time
has been taken away.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:36.203
Well..

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.573
...I don't have much of it
left myself.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:43.916
The oncologist says
it's in my bones.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.666
Where's your medication?

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:49.712
<i>No, I don't need it.</i>

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:51.969
There's no pain.

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.763
Not yet.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.016
[scoffs]
I don't believe you.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:01.387
Look, if it'll make you
hate me any less

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.185
why don't you ring
the consultant?

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.523
Here, Dr. Burman.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.360
He won't lie.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.824
Maybe you're not
the only one

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.164
that's allowed
to change.

been here now, Carl?</i>

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.942
Uh, about a year,
uh, just over.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.606
Have you stayed
anywhere else?

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.980
No, this was the first
place I got.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.950
Your downstairs neighbor, Mr. Prempeh
recalls hearing...

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:41.195
Loud music,
dancing and voices.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.448
Voices. Plural.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.199
- Yes.
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.827
Yes, plural.
My mother was staying.

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:50.250
- Dancing?
- Uh, no.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.373
- I... I was dancing.
- While she was?

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:55.126
- Watching.
- Uh, complaining actually.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:58.379
She doesn't like music and she
wanted me to turn it off.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:06:59.800
Is your mother
still staying?

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.719
Uh, no,
she left this afternoon.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.469
<i>- Not from London then?
- Isle of Wight.</i>

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.596
<i>- Did she stay long?
- Three or four days.</i>

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:07.847
Three or four?

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:10.607
Four.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.693
<i>Did either of you leave
the flat that night?</i>

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.438
No.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:33.748
Thank you.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.929
<i>Silly me.</i>

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.554
I left it on the bedroom lamp.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.979
So..

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.228
...I'll say goodbye.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.104
<i>If that's what
you want.</i>

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.531

None of them
is missing a button.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.419
They've arrested
someone.

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.297
The husband.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:32.051
Well, it's always
the ones that are closest.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.680
Denies it, of course.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.400
He says she left
the nightclub

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.610
with another man.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.615
<i>So they've checked
the CCTV.</i>

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:51.870
It seems the cameras were
either fake or broken.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:56.958
So they've put
the word out

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:59.248
for someone
with a mobile

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:02.914

taken pictures.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:43.523

Ca... Canada.

- Wh...
<i>- I can't hear you.</i>

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.022
Uh, about Canada.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.328
I... I'd have to get
my passport renewed.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.410
<i>Just like that?</i>

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.750
Is... Isn't that
what you were suggesting?

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.668
<i>Last I heard you were
starting a family.</i>

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.344
I thought she
could come.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.258
<i>You'll have some
explaining to do.</i>

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.184
<i>You told her
I was dead remember?</i>

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.428
I'll sa... say
it was a joke.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.681
<i>You never had
the wit for jokes.</i>

<i>What does Rose do
with herself I wonder?</i>

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.318
Works with dogs.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:38.070
Walks 'em.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.788
She's a dog walker.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.373
<i>You don't like dogs.</i>

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.914
And is that who
you were with?

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.541
Rose?

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.508
Yes.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:56.675
<i>Stayed the night,
did she?</i>

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.845
Yes.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:05.848
But you didn't think to
tell that to the police.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:09.477
Well, we'd, we'd
had an argument and..

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:11.399
...I thought if..

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:12.862
<i>...I said she was here.</i>

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:15.699
They might think
she was the poor

dead girl.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:19.663

Did you have
a drink, Carl?

<i>Did you have
a little drink?</i>

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:40.303
Why don't you come in

something</i>

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.555

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.024
You don't want it?

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.234
He's being polite.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.443
He's already eaten.

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:34.857
Then leave it.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.321
It's okay.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.447
The police were here
askin' questions

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:42.661
about that poor girl.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:46.285
Oh, you don't want
to read about it

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.453
but you do, don't you?

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.452
You can't help yourself.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.455
Cut her up into bits.

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:54.502
Threw her away
like a piece of rubbish.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:58.510
Right here in one
of these flats.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.595
No.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.339
They've arrested
someone.

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:04.432
Not any more, they let
the husband go.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.265
- Why?
- New leads.

01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:08.557
Is all they said.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.869
[dishes clattering]

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:49.687
Carl?

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:52.890
Would you bring me
a plaster?

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.856
<i>Carl.</i>

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.363
<i>Can you bring me
a plaster?</i>

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:26.886
You'll have
to clean it first.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:52.786
I must have scraped it..

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.329
...when I sat down.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:32.531
[sighs]

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.952
Did you have
sex with her?

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:43.132
That's something
I can't wash out.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:13.159

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.289
You left clues
everywhere.

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:44.044
Don't you remember

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.914
how happy we were?

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:46.924
Where is the phone?

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:50.089
Happiness to kill for.

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:55.473
You destroyed it.

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:56.592
The phone!

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:03.682
[instrumental music]

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:10.363

please.</i>

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.895
<i>I only want
to help you.</i>

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.814
<i>Please.
Open the door.</i>

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:24.784

the colors change.</i>

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.369
Do you like it, son?

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.743
<i>Uh, the door's stuck.</i>

01:26:56.753 --> 01:27:00.246
Got it on the ferry over,
remember?

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:02.419
<i>Happy as a jumping bean
you were.</i>

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:04.634
[knocking on door]

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:07.174
When I came
back for you.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.012
I didn't even
recognize you.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.848
<i>Staring back at me
with your mother's eyes.</i>

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:14.770
[knocking on door]

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.262
<i>Hello.</i>

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.855
<i>I can't open the door.</i>

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.396
I don't blame you, Carl.

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.025
She filled you
full of poison.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:29.238
<i>Carl..</i>

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.780
<i>...touch me.</i>

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.154
<i>I can't open the door.</i>

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:40.870
<i>Please, I can't
open the door.</i>

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:54.884
I'm going to stay.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.301
Will you open
the fucking door?

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.351
<i>I can see you.</i>

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.208
Hey. No... no...
no... no.

01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:52.371
Wesley, stop it!
Get the fuck out!

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:53.839
Get out!

01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:55.799
Fuck's sake.

01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:58.794
For fuck's sake.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:29.333

to my jeans?</i>

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:36.791

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:54.020
Here.

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:58.942
Uh.

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:03.696
What have you done
to my stuff?

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:07.030
It's fucked.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.952
Where's my phone?

01:33:08.958 --> 01:33:09.994
I don't know.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:15.416
You, you said..

01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:18.707
If it... it...
it sent me somewhere.

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:21.753
You'd come and get me.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.428
