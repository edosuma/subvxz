WEBVTT

00:00.201 --> 00:00.234
.

00:02.736 --> 00:05.273
(Mindy)
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
ABOUT NEW RELATIONSHIPS IS

00:05.306 --> 00:06.540
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER

00:06.574 --> 00:08.409
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE OF ONE MIND.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.278
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
TONIGHT?

00:10.311 --> 00:14.148
I WAS THINKING MAYBE THAI FOOD--
SEX ON THE WASHING MACHINE.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.684
OKAY.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.053
REALLY?
SEE, ONE MIND.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.788
OKAY, I BETTER HEAD OUT
TO MY C-SECTION.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.657
IT'S A CUTE ONE.
TWO TWINS ARE HUGGING, DANNY.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.659
THAT SOUNDS ADORABLE.
DON'T FORGET YOUR STUFF.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.228
MY TOOTHBRUSH AND BRUSH?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.229
I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST
LEAVE THAT HERE.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.298
UH, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANNA DO THAT, YOU KNOW?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.466
IT MIGHT JUST GET LOST
IN MY CLUTTER.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.667
CLUTTER?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.369
THIS PLACE IS TIDY
LIKE A SERIAL KILLER'S LAIR.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.837
I LIKE TO KEEP EVERYTHING
IN ITS PLACE:

00:36.870 --> 00:40.341
MY COMPACT DISC, MY BALSAMICS,
MY SEAT FROM YANKEE STADIUM.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.277
OH, THAT OLD BENCH
WHERE I CUT MY TOENAILS?

00:43.311 --> 00:45.379
NEXT TO YOU, THAT'S
THE MOST VALUABLE THING I OWN.

00:45.413 --> 00:49.317
IT EVEN HAS VINTAGE CURSE WORDS
CARVED IN IT.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.785
I DID THOSE.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.786
TAKE YOUR STUFF.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.524
[sighs]
FINE.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.560
(Mindy)
SO IF DANNY WON'T LET ME
KEEP SOME OF MY THINGS HERE,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.862
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.234
THERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.
AW.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.301
HOW--

01:07.335 --> 01:08.169
(Mindy)
AND SINCE THAT DIDN'T WORK,

01:08.202 --> 01:11.272
I'LL FIND
EVEN MORE CREATIVE PLACES.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.446
HERE YOU GO, BABE.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.619
(Mindy)
UNTIL FINALLY I PUT THEM IN
A PLACE HE'LL NEVER FIND THEM.

01:25.653 --> 01:26.854
HEY.
[screams]

01:26.887 --> 01:29.857
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS STUFF
GOT OUT HERE.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.792
HERE YOU GO.

01:31.825 --> 01:32.793
YOU KNOW, DANNY,

01:32.826 --> 01:34.362
I'M SPENDING
A LOT OF NIGHTS HERE,

01:34.395 --> 01:35.463
AND IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE TIRING

01:35.496 --> 01:36.697
LUGGING MY STUFF
BACK AND FORTH.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.599
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:38.632 --> 01:40.434
THINKING
ABOUT THE SAME THING.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.770
OH.
COME HERE, CHECK THIS OUT.

01:42.803 --> 01:47.275
HALF OF YOUR CLOSET?
FOR ME?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.742
MA GAVE THIS TO ME

01:48.776 --> 01:50.511
WHEN SHE SENT ME
TO DIVORCED KIDS CAMP.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.379
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
IN THERE.

01:51.412 --> 01:55.149
YOU CAN WHEEL YOUR STUFF
BACK AND FORTH.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.617
THAT'S A VERY NICE GIFT,
DANNY.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.287
HEY, IT'S A LOAN.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.458
[wheels squeaking]

02:04.492 --> 02:06.494
SEE YOU LATER.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
YOU DIDN'T, UH--

02:08.562 --> 02:09.763
YOU GOTTA PUT
YOUR STUFF IN IT, MIN.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.266
[upbeat music]

02:14.702 --> 02:18.439
THERE ARE FIVE SIGNS
OF LOW-GRADE SQUAMOUS LESION.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.474
I CHOSE THIS GRAPHIC
OF A COOL DOLPHIN, THOUGH,

02:20.508 --> 02:21.475
BECAUSE SOMEONE
VERY CLOSE TO ME

02:21.509 --> 02:22.776
TOLD ME
THAT LESIONS ARE GROSS.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.378
OH, I JUST GOT
A SHOUT-OUT.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.546
ANYWAY--
I'M SO SORRY.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.415
AFTER THE PRESENTATION,
IS THERE A LIMIT

02:27.448 --> 02:28.249
ON BAGELS PER PERSON?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.350
BECAUSE HEAD COUNT-WISE,

02:29.383 --> 02:30.184
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE ENOUGH.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.151
I'M NOT DOING QUESTIONS,
AND I TOLD YOU

02:31.185 --> 02:33.221
NOT TO DEPEND ON FOOD AT WORK
FOR SUSTENANCE.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.755
HE'S JUST PICKING
THE SEEDS OFF.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.357
IT WAS AN EVERYTHING BAGEL.
NOW IT'S NOTHING.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.891
HE'S NOT WRONG
TO BE CONCERNED.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.793
GREAT, NOW PEOPLE ARE RAISING
THEIR HANDS. YEAH?

02:39.827 --> 02:41.595
ARE YOU MINDY LAHIRI?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.297
I AM.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.365
ARE YOU
FROM MCFADDEN'S STEAKHOUSE?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.235
DID YOU FIND MY SHOE?
NO.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.569
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.204
(man)
WOW.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.506
MINDY, YOU HAVEN'T
PAID YOUR TAXES IN SIX YEARS.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.341
WHAT?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.908
NO WONDER THEY WANT
TO LOCK YOU UP.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.278
I THOUGHT THEY TOOK IT
OUT OF OUR PAYCHECKS.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.446
HEY, TAX EVASION
IS A SERIOUS CRIME.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.647
YOU'RE STEALING FROM AMERICA.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.982
ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF,
STEALING FROM THE GRAND CANYON?

03:02.015 --> 03:02.816
THE LIBERTY BELL?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.219
THE LIBERTY BELL IS
A PIECE OF CRAP.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.354
THERE'S A CRACK
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.355
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
(Danny)
WHAT?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.290
THAT WAS JACKED UP
WELL BEFORE I HIT THE SCENE.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.791
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT YOU ALL PAY YOUR TAXES?

03:10.824 --> 03:11.892
(all)
YES.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.661
I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO PAY
INCOME TAXES

03:13.694 --> 03:16.564
BECAUSE MY SALARY PUTS ME
UNDER THE POVERTY LEVEL.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.766
I CAN'T HEAR ABOUT
YOUR ECONOMIC ISSUES.
[tiny violin sound]

03:18.799 --> 03:20.501
POOR BABY!
HOW IS THAT
YOUR REACTION?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.371
MINDY, YOUR BIGGEST ASSET
IS YOUR STAKE IN THIS PRACTICE.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.739
IF THE GOVERNMENT
PUTS A LIEN ON YOUR EARNINGS,

03:25.773 --> 03:27.408
IT'S GONNA AFFECT US ALL.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.243
DAMN IT, MINDY, YOU CAN'T MAKE
A MESS AND IGNORE IT

03:29.277 --> 03:30.678
AND JUST EXPECT IT
TO GET CLEANED UP.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.745
IT AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.315
LIKE THE TIME SHE LEFT
MY FAUCET ON ALL WEEKEND.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.316
BECAUSE THE EARTH
ISN'T COVERED

03:35.349 --> 03:36.817
WITH A MILLION
OCEANS, DANNY.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.319
WHEREVER WILL WE
GET MORE WATER?

03:38.352 --> 03:39.387
NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T HEAR

03:39.420 --> 03:40.254
ABOUT THIS FAUCET
THING ANYMORE.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.922
MINDY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET A LAWYER.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.591
OH, WAIT.
I DID GET A LAWYER

03:43.624 --> 03:44.792
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS
MONTHS AGO.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.294
OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.362
OH, GOD.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.430
WHAT?

03:49.463 --> 03:51.031
WELL, WELL, WELL,

03:51.064 --> 03:54.302
WELL, WELL, WELL,
WELL, WELL, WELL,

03:54.335 --> 03:55.603
WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL, WELL--

03:55.636 --> 03:56.804
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.339
CLIFF, YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA

03:58.372 --> 03:59.340
TAKE CARE OF THIS.
YEAH, AND YOU SAID

03:59.373 --> 04:00.341
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
CHEAT ON ME

04:00.374 --> 04:01.675
WITH DANNY,
AND THEN DUMPED ME.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.576
OKAY, I WOULD NEVER
HAVE SAID THAT.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.446
THAT WOULD HAVE
SOUNDED VERY SUSPICIOUS.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.047
LOOK, CLIFF.
I AM VERY SORRY

04:07.080 --> 04:09.283
THAT I HURT YOU.
BUT...

04:09.317 --> 04:10.384
CAN'T YOU JUST
TAKE CARE OF THIS

04:10.418 --> 04:12.586
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?
NO.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.854
COULD YOU TAKE CARE OF THIS
FOR THAT TIME

04:13.887 --> 04:16.424
WE DID IT IN
THE WAX MUSEUM?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.592
THAT WASN'T ME.
WHA--REALLY?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.628
OKAY, THAT WAS DANNY.
OKAY, I AM SO SORRY.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.429
ALL RIGHT,
JUST AT LEAST GIVE ME

04:21.462 --> 04:22.763
MY RECEIPTS
AND MY PAPERS BACK.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.764
NO, MINDY.
I THINK THE UNIVERSE

04:23.797 --> 04:24.798
SHOULD PUNISH YOU.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.866
WHY DO YOU GET
EVERYTHING YOU WANT?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.000
I MEAN, I HELP
YOU OUT WITH THIS

04:27.034 --> 04:28.001
AND YOU STILL GET
TO DATE THE GUY

04:28.035 --> 04:28.902
THAT YOU CHEATED
ON ME WITH?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.404
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THAT YOU WOULD

04:30.438 --> 04:31.972
HELP ME IF I WASN'T
DATING DANNY?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.908
WELL, I DON'T KN-KNOW.
I MEAN...

04:34.942 --> 04:37.511
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
DID YOU TWO...

04:37.545 --> 04:39.313
BREAK UP?

04:42.783 --> 04:46.420
YES. YES, WE DID
BREAK UP.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.390
AND DANNY
CHEATED ON ME.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.327
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH
DANNY'S BETRAYAL,

04:53.361 --> 04:54.528
SO WE BROKE UP.
OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T--

04:54.562 --> 04:55.529
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.697
IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE,
CLIFF,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.031
JUST HORRIBLE.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.032
I'VE COMPLETELY
STOPPED EATING,

04:59.066 --> 05:00.568
AS YOU CAN TELL.
I'M SO THIN.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.035
GOD, IT'S COLD
IN HERE.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.036
AND THEY EVEN
SAID THEY MIGHT

05:03.070 --> 05:05.105
TAKE AWAY
THE PRACTICE.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.407
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.008
THE WORLD HAS A WAY

05:08.041 --> 05:09.943
OF BEING SO
UNKIND TO PEOPLE

05:09.977 --> 05:11.545
LIKE US...

05:11.579 --> 05:14.915
PEOPLE WHO JUST
WANT TO LOVE.

05:14.948 --> 05:15.716
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.785
YOU'RE RIGHT, MINDY.
I-I DIDN'T KNOW

05:17.818 --> 05:19.387
THAT YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH ALL OF THIS,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.088
AND I CAN CERTAINLY
RELATE TO IT.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.090
AND I'M SURPRISED
THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE

05:23.123 --> 05:24.358
SHARING THIS WITH ME.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.526
SO COMFORTABLE.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.995
I ACTUALLY
JUST FARTED.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.996
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.364
MAYBE I'M CRAZY,
BUT I'LL DO IT.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.433
I'LL TAKE
YOUR TAX CASE.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.467
YOU WILL?
YEAH.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
OH, MY GOD.
CLIFF, THANK YOU

05:35.035 --> 05:36.670
SO, SO MUCH.
I CAN NEVER

05:36.704 --> 05:38.071
RE-PAY YOU,
AND I DON'T PLAN TO.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.039
I KNOW.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.144
UM, PETER,
COULD I SQUEEZE BY

05:44.177 --> 05:47.715
AND GET TO THE CABINET?

05:47.748 --> 05:48.782
JUST WITHOUT
MY DAILY VITAMIN,

05:48.816 --> 05:52.686
MY VISION BLURS.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.021
NO WORRIES, MAN.
I GOT IT FOR YOU.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.856
OH...
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE

05:55.889 --> 05:57.024
WHILE I'M IN THE CAB?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.526
WE GOT MINDY'S
OSTEOPOROSIS CHEWS,

05:58.559 --> 05:59.993
IN CASE YOU WANNA
KEEP YOUR BONE

06:00.027 --> 06:01.495
GAME TIGHT.
THANK YOU.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.668
WOW, PETE. YOU'RE BEING
REALLY NICE TO THAT GUY

06:07.701 --> 06:09.770
WHO WAS JUST PLAYING
TONSIL HOCKEY WITH YOUR GIRL.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.505
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT LAUREN AND I

06:11.539 --> 06:12.606
HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.941
AND WHAT HAPPENED
WITH HER AND JEREMY,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.042
THAT WAS A CRAZY TIME.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.043
THE LEAVES WERE CHANGING.

06:16.076 --> 06:16.944
EVERYONE WAS PSYCHED ABOUT

06:16.977 --> 06:18.546
THE NEW FALL SHOWS.
I DON'T KNOW, PETE.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.147
YOUR KISSES ARE
FOR THREE THINGS--

06:20.180 --> 06:21.148
YOUR MA, YOUR GIRL,

06:21.181 --> 06:23.484
AND YOUR WRESTLING COACH
AFTER YOU WIN REGIONALS.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.553
IT AIN'T A REAL KISS
IF IT'S ABOVE THE BELT.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.756
YES. THANK YOU, BEVERLY.
THANK YOU.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.824
HEY.
HEY.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.527
DID YOU NOTICE I PUT SOME
AXLE GREASE ON WHEELIE?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.028
SMOOTH RIDE, HUH?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.930
YEAH. AND I'M MEETING
A LOT OF COOL PEOPLE

06:36.964 --> 06:38.999
WHEN I DRAG IT UP
THE SUBWAY STAIRS.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.968
A LOT OF, "GO BACK
TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY."

06:41.001 --> 06:42.970
OH, THAT'S NICE.
OKAY, LET ME GET

06:43.003 --> 06:44.738
THAT FOR YOU HERE.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.106
HEY, DID YOU
TALK TO CLIFF?

06:46.139 --> 06:47.841
EVERYONE'S REALLY
FREAKED OUT

06:47.875 --> 06:48.809
THAT WE'RE GONNA
LOSE THE PRACTICE.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.944
MORGAN'S BEEN GOING
UP TO THE ROOF A LOT.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.047
I DID TALK TO CLIFF,
AND THE GREAT NEWS

06:54.081 --> 06:55.916
IS THAT HE SAID HE WOULD
HELP ME WITH MY TAXES.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.051
NICE.
THERE'S A SMALL CATCH.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.620
OKAY.
CLIFF WAS STILL

06:59.653 --> 07:02.723
VERY UPSET THAT
I CHEATED ON HIM WITH YOU.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.225
RIGHT.
SO I TOLD HIM
THAT WE WERE BROKEN UP.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.760
YOU DID WHAT?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.061
I TOLD HIM THAT
WE WERE BROKEN UP.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.463
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

07:09.497 --> 07:10.698
BECAUSE CLIFF
ONLY WANTED TO HELP ME

07:10.731 --> 07:12.065
IF HE FELT
SORRY FOR ME.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.101
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY
GUYS EVER WANT TO HELP GIRLS.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.565
THAT'S ONLY

13:52.599 --> 13:53.934
THAT MEANS LESS

14:39.712 --> 14:42.115
'SCUSE ME.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.922
[phone rings]

14:48.956 --> 14:50.323
DOWNTOWN NEUROLOGICAL
PARTNERS.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.191
IF THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.360
PLEASE CALL THE TRIBECA
INSANE ASYLUM.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.029
(Peter)
HELLO, THIS IS
DR. JEREMY REED,

14:56.063 --> 14:57.130
BABY, YEAH.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.698
SCWHING!
DONK-AY!

14:58.731 --> 15:00.033
HEY, DR. REED.

15:00.067 --> 15:00.833
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

15:00.867 --> 15:03.170
WELL, GUV'NAH.
I WAS JUST CALLING

15:03.203 --> 15:05.939
TO SEE IF LAUREN
HAD ANY LUNCH PLANS TODAY.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.575
YOU KNOW, ME BEING
TERRIBLY FORGETFUL AND ALL.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.177
YEAH, SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AT LUNCH

15:10.210 --> 15:12.012
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.214
I KNEW IT!
UH, UH--

15:14.247 --> 15:16.950
UH, THANK YOU,
UH, VERY MUCH

15:16.984 --> 15:19.252
[weird accent]
FOR THIS-A INFORMATION.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.354
UH, W-W-WHO YOU TALKING TO?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.023
UH, MY WIFE.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.626
DR. REED IN HERE?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.128
HUH?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.632
OH, MAMA. WELL.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.666
[thud]
YOU TELL MY GIRLFRIEND

15:33.700 --> 15:36.603
I'M STILL MARRIED?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.271
SO YOU ARE
STILL TOGETHER WITH MINDY.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.472
YEAH, I KNEW IT.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.707
YOU KNOW, MY FIRST CLUE
WAS WHEN MINDY

15:40.740 --> 15:42.542
POSTED A PHOTO OF YOU
IN THE SHOWER.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.444
HASHTAG,
MY SUDSY BOYFLIFE.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.979
I THOUGHT
I SAW A FLASH.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.647
YEAH. YOU'RE
A PERFECT COUPLE.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.316
YOU'RE TERRIBLE PEOPLE
AND YOU'RE HUGE LIARS.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
OH, YEAH? WELL, I'M NOT
LYING ANYMORE, CLIFF.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.352
I'M DONE WITH LYING.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.586
I'M GONNA GO
SEE A LAWYER,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.288
I'M GONNA
FINALIZE MY DIVORCE.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.523
THAT'S GREAT.
WHICH LAWYER?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.691
MY COUSIN DON.
HE MOSTLY HANDLES

15:58.725 --> 15:59.559
DOGS THAT BITE PEOPLE,

15:59.592 --> 16:01.361
BUT HE KNOWS STUFF
ABOUT HUMANS TOO.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.662
SO, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.764
I GOT IT COVERED.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.765
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT,

16:05.798 --> 16:07.367
DANNY?
WHAT?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.070
DON'T DO THAT.
I'LL HANDLE YOUR DIVORCE.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.704
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO DO THAT FOR ME?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.440
YOU'VE ACTUALLY
GOT SOMETHING I WANT.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.741
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT MINDY?

16:14.774 --> 16:16.676
SOMETHING THAT'S HAD
EVEN MORE MEN ON TOP OF HER.

16:20.713 --> 16:24.384
BEAUTIFUL.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.718
I DON'T REMEMBER
ALL THESE SWEAR WORDS

16:25.752 --> 16:29.022
BEING CARVED INTO IT,
THOUGH.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.124
[sniffles]

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
DANNY, YOU'RE NOT
CRYING, ARE YOU?

16:33.526 --> 16:35.528
NO!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.502
WELL, IT WAS NICE
KNOWING ALL OF YOU.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.405
CAN'T SAY THE SAME.
BEING HONEST.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.175
IMMIGRATION SERVICES
ARE LOOKING INTO MY STATUS.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.411
APPARENTLY, AN ANONYMOUS PHONE
CALL HAS GOTTEN ME RED-FLAGGED.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
WHY DO THEY CARE?
YOU'RE MEXICAN.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.415
I CAN'T GO
BACK TO ENGLAND.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.317
I'VE FORGOTTEN
ALL THE WORDS.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.652
HOW DO THE ENGLISH
SAY "ELEVATOR"?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.355
LORF?
BLIFT?

17:02.389 --> 17:03.756
LOOK, JEREMY,

17:03.790 --> 17:04.824
I THINK YOU
SHOULD GO BACK

17:04.857 --> 17:06.393
TO ENGLAND
FOR AS LONG AS

17:06.426 --> 17:07.627
IT TAKES
FOR YOU TO GET

17:07.660 --> 17:09.229
THIS SITUATION
SORTED OUT.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.563
COME BACK
IN A FEW MONTHS.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.565
SURE, SOME PEOPLE
WILL HAVE MOVED ON

17:12.599 --> 17:13.733
TO SOME OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT--

17:13.766 --> 17:14.767
NOT ONLY AM I GETTING
DEPORTED,

17:14.801 --> 17:16.236
BUT LAUREN TELLS ME

17:16.269 --> 17:17.670
SHE WANTS TO PUT
A PIN IN IT.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.539
WAIT. I'M SORRY.
LAUREN TOLD YOU

17:19.572 --> 17:21.241
SHE WANTED
TO PUT A PIN IN IT?

17:21.274 --> 17:22.309
SO YOU'RE NOT
DATING ANYMORE

17:22.342 --> 17:23.710
NO. QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.778
I'M A MAN
WITH NO COUNTRY

17:25.812 --> 17:27.380
AND NO WOMAN.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.482
(Morgan)
OH.
OH, MY GOD.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.651
I HAD TO TAKE
THE STAIRS.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.087
YOU GUYS KNOW
THE BLIFT IS BROKEN?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.358
YOU WILL KEEP
YOUR PORTION

17:38.391 --> 17:39.592
OF THE PRACTICE,
AND CHRISTINA

17:39.626 --> 17:41.561
WILL RETAIN OWNERSHIP
OF YOUR BOAT,

17:41.594 --> 17:42.729
THE FUGGETA-BOAT-IT.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.431
THAT'S OKAY.
AFTER CAPTAIN PHILLIPS,

17:44.464 --> 17:46.499
I GOT TOO SPOOKED
TO GO ON IT.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.435
WELL,
YOU ARE DIVORCED.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.869
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MAN

17:49.902 --> 17:52.672
AND...NOTHING.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.141
HEY, CLIFF.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.642
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.745
AND SAY THAT I'M...

17:58.778 --> 18:00.847
I'M SORRY ABOUT
ALL THE LIES, OKAY?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.449
MINDY'S GONNA
BE REALLY HAPPY

18:02.482 --> 18:03.716
WE SORTED THIS OUT,
SO...

18:03.750 --> 18:06.119
YEAH. GOOD.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.388
WHAT?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.657
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
WITH THE TWO OF YOU?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.592
BECAUSE WHEN MINDY AND I
WERE GOING STRONG,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.561
MY APARTMENT WAS JUST
ABSOLUTELY BURIED IN HER STUFF--

18:14.594 --> 18:17.197
HIDDEN WINE BOTTLES,
BRAS DRYING IN THE OVEN.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.665
HER STUFF WAS
SCATTERED EVERYWHERE.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.569
DANNY, THERE'S NO SIGN
OF HER HERE.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.137
WELL, THERE'S
PLENTY OF HER STUFF

18:24.171 --> 18:25.405
ALL AROUND HERE, SO...

18:25.438 --> 18:26.473
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.774
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
YEAH.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.676
I'M GONNA, UH,
GO TAKE THIS YANKEE SEAT

18:29.709 --> 18:30.743
AND LIGHT IT ON FIRE.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.512
WHAT?
I'M A RED SOX FAN.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.147
YOU ARE?
YEAH.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.715
GO, SOX!

18:44.357 --> 18:45.658
(man)
AS THE ACCOUNTANT
FOR THIS PRACTICE,

18:45.692 --> 18:47.894
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.229
THIS IS
THE MOST CHALLENGING

18:49.262 --> 18:51.898
TAX CASE
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.233
IN JULY
OF LAST YEAR,

18:53.266 --> 18:56.503
YOU SPENT MORE
MONEY ON EMOJIS THAN RENT?

18:56.536 --> 18:57.737
COUPLE THINGS.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.706
NOT CRAZY ABOUT
THIS JUDGMENTAL TONE,

18:59.739 --> 19:01.374
FIRST OF ALL.
SECOND OF ALL,

19:01.408 --> 19:02.842
THOSE WERE
A BUSINESS EXPENSE.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.511
THEY HELPED
TO SELL MY BRAND.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.513
WHICH IS
SASSY-BUT-BANGABLE BRAT.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.481
WE'RE REALLY PUSHING
THE BRAND THIS YEAR.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.849
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.751
I JUST THINK
IT'S TIME I RETIRE.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.186
(Lauren)
JEREMY?

19:13.220 --> 19:14.687
EXCUSE ME.
IS JEREMY HERE?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.890
OH.
STAY HERE.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.759
JUST...
WORK YOUR MAGIC.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.694
HEY, ARE YOU
GETTING DEPORTED?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.330
YOU CAN'T GO
BACK TO ENGLAND.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.298
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
THE I.N.S. LOST INTEREST

19:25.332 --> 19:27.334
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
I WAS RICH AND WHITE.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.935
THAT'S SUCH GREAT NEWS.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.471
LISTEN, WHEN I THOUGHT
OF YOU GOING AWAY,

19:31.504 --> 19:32.972
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
MAYBE I DON'T

19:33.005 --> 19:34.407
WANT TO PUT
A PIN IN IT.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.475
LET'S NOT PUT
A PIN IN IT.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.709
OKAY.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.980
[mumbles]
WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE
GOING TO--WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.715
THEY COULD BE
GOING IN THERE TO BREAK UP.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.351
YEAH, MORE LIKE
HOOK UP.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.985
[sighs]
SORRY.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.754
(Mindy)
WITH THIS SIGNATURE,
I AM SQUARE

19:47.787 --> 19:49.356
WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.823
WOW, IF I'M GONNA PAY
FOR NATIONAL PARKS,

19:50.857 --> 19:53.493
I BETTER CHECK THEM OUT.
WHAT'S THAT ONE CALLED?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
BIG HOLE?
MOUNT FACEMORE?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.796
MMM.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.398
YOU WANNA
STAY OVER TONIGHT?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.532
YOU CAN EAT
THE CHOCOLATE CASINGS

19:59.566 --> 20:01.301
OFF ALL
MY ICE CREAM BARS.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.535
I SHOULDN'T.
IF I SPEND THE NIGHT

20:02.569 --> 20:03.536
WITH A MARRIED MAN,

20:03.570 --> 20:04.537
IT'S GONNA BE
BECAUSE HE GOT

20:04.571 --> 20:05.638
MY KID
INTO PREP SCHOOL.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.740
WELL, THAT'S...
REALLY GOOD NEWS,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.743
'CAUSE I'M NOT
MARRIED ANYMORE.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.745
I FINALIZED
MY DIVORCE.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.747
REALLY?
YEAH.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.250
THANK YOU.
BECAUSE YOU HELPED ME

20:17.284 --> 20:19.852
CLEAN UP MY OLD MESS.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

20:19.886 --> 20:22.389
I CAN CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME,

20:22.422 --> 20:23.990
LIKE...

20:24.023 --> 20:26.659
MY WORK.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.262
AND FAITH.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.530
AND YOU.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.964
WHAT? NO.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.033
AFTER FAITH?
THAT'S TOO MUCH.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.269
I CAN'T
ACCEPT THAT.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.470
I CAN'T, THOUGH.
I ACTUALLY NEED

20:37.504 --> 20:38.905
TO GO HOME.
I LEFT WHEELIE THERE.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.440
COME HERE.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.711
OH, MY GOD.
DANNY!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.613
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
THIS IS LIKE

20:46.646 --> 20:47.647
THE NICEST PIECE
OF FURNITURE

20:47.680 --> 20:49.449
IN YOUR HOUSE.
I GOT IT AT

20:49.482 --> 20:52.485
SOME GIRL BOUTIQUE
CALLED ISABEL'S ATTIC.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.953
THE LADY'S CAT
WAS ALL OVER ME.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.655
YOU MET DOILIE?
IF SHE LIKES YOU,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.790
THAT'S HUGE.
YEAH?

20:57.824 --> 21:00.293
DANNY...
IT'S PERFECT.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.561
YOU LIKE IT?
THANK YOU.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.795
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.664
NOW HOW ABOUT WE GO
TO YOUR BEDROOM

21:04.697 --> 21:06.366
AND YOU SHOW ME
IF THERE'S ANY ROOM

21:06.399 --> 21:07.634
IN YOUR CLOSET FOR ME.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.036
NO. NO, THERE'S NO
SPACE FOR YOU IN THERE

21:10.069 --> 21:12.539
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL
MY PRESSED JEANS GO, OKAY?

21:12.572 --> 21:14.874
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU.
YOU GOT THIS NOW, OKAY?

21:14.907 --> 21:17.344
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GO AND, UH, CHECK ANYWAY.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.346
I DON'T NEED TO CHECK.
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,

21:19.379 --> 21:20.647
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU
IN THERE.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.048
HAVE SEX WITH ME
IN YOUR CLOSET,

21:22.081 --> 21:24.617
YOU DUMB-DUMB.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.786
OHH.
OKAY.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.087
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.523
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.524
(Mindy)
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT CLEVER.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.792
(Danny)
OKAY.
