00:08.836 --> 00:11.645
Marco, you all right?

00:11.669 --> 00:14.382
Been waiting a long time for this, Andrea.

Go go go!

00:34.536 --> 00:35.643
Quiet!

01:08.838 --> 01:11.226
Marco! Upstairs!

01:18.347 --> 01:20.473
- Shit.
- There are three of them.

01:20.593 --> 01:22.592
Looks like they've been here for months.

01:23.861 --> 01:25.702
Recognize anyone of them?

01:27.930 --> 01:29.250
Yeah.

01:40.237 --> 01:42.078
Oh my God!

01:45.988 --> 01:47.383
Pietro Fonti,

01:47.503 --> 01:50.561
taken from a car park in
Rhode Island when he was 13.

01:50.681 --> 01:52.015
13...

01:52.284 --> 01:53.721
Jesus.

02:01.136 --> 02:02.767
What's that?

02:03.111 --> 02:04.271
I don't know.

02:05.575 --> 02:07.046
Maybe nothing.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.636
- Get an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.706
Stop!

02:37.164 --> 02:38.890
Stop!

02:42.235 --> 02:44.875
Turn around. Hands in the air!

02:46.918 --> 02:49.404
Come on. Turn around.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.965
Put the gun down. Drop...

02:55.403 --> 02:57.532
Hey, wait! OK?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.149
Just wait. Look...

03:04.037 --> 03:05.484
I'm unarmed.

03:06.042 --> 03:07.846
You found me, Inspector.

03:07.869 --> 03:10.973
Let's talk. OK? Just talk.

03:12.313 --> 03:14.101
Just tell me where she is.

03:14.221 --> 03:15.712
Please.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.787
I'm not going to prison.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.451
It's gonna be all right.

03:19.571 --> 03:21.750
- No!
- Just tell me where she is.

03:22.973 --> 03:24.870
That's all I wanna know.

03:25.660 --> 03:26.852
OK?

03:27.092 --> 03:28.586
You'll never find her!

03:28.896 --> 03:30.708
No!

03:31.893 --> 03:33.472
"You'll never find her!"

INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, The Hague

04:17.394 --> 04:19.930
Silence General Wombosi.

04:20.534 --> 04:22.539
Is that your response?

04:23.863 --> 04:25.984
Did you pose a question, Mr. Dorn?

04:26.039 --> 04:28.431
Look at the screens in front of you.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.312
Crimes against children,

04:30.351 --> 04:32.472
crimes that include mass murder,

04:32.518 --> 04:34.136
ethnic cleansing.

04:34.384 --> 04:36.491
Those are the charges
that have been assessed

04:36.492 --> 04:38.655
and levelled against you, sir.

04:38.716 --> 04:40.934
- What say you?
- You had the charges,

04:40.950 --> 04:42.839
for which you have no evidence.

04:45.509 --> 04:48.792
I have no personal connection
to any of these crimes.

04:48.977 --> 04:51.207
I'm not required to answer such lies.

04:52.152 --> 04:54.382
Get to the point, Mr. Dorn.

04:54.644 --> 04:56.247
Well, then I'll just deal with

04:56.367 --> 04:58.554
irrefutable facts.

05:04.469 --> 05:06.706
We have provided

05:06.826 --> 05:08.487
concrete evidence

05:08.541 --> 05:10.523
that you have ruled your country

05:10.554 --> 05:12.342
with an iron fist

05:12.462 --> 05:15.648
- for 13 years.
- And I will rule it for another 13 years,

05:15.679 --> 05:18.412
once this charade is over.

05:18.899 --> 05:21.206
Once this is over, General,

05:21.872 --> 05:25.472
you will never again
leave your prison cell.

05:27.476 --> 05:29.032
I thank the court,

05:29.152 --> 05:32.903
but we have refuted all
evidence blaming General Wombosi.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.985
If Mr. Dorn continues to insists my client

05:35.986 --> 05:38.166
is guilty of these terrible acts

05:38.171 --> 05:40.366
committed in the East Congo,

05:40.999 --> 05:42.337
I say,

05:42.746 --> 05:43.855
prove it.

05:44.325 --> 05:45.384
Michel...

05:46.868 --> 05:48.068
I just found...

05:51.410 --> 05:52.896
Mr. Dorn?

05:54.568 --> 05:56.814
You asked for proof connecting you

05:56.819 --> 05:58.719
personally to these crimes.

05:59.181 --> 06:00.600
General,

06:00.779 --> 06:03.182
did you order the execution of

06:03.188 --> 06:06.353
hundreds of villagers in 2013?

06:06.473 --> 06:08.415
These are encrypted emails

06:08.452 --> 06:10.341
showing that foreign mercenaries

06:10.363 --> 06:12.606
killed those villagers in Banui

06:12.802 --> 06:15.178
under orders personally given

06:15.364 --> 06:16.695
by you.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.159
If it please the court,

06:25.163 --> 06:28.000
I ask for a recess to study

06:28.061 --> 06:30.557
this new allegation against my client.

06:30.954 --> 06:32.496
Recess granted.

06:35.776 --> 06:37.789
Where did you get that evidence from?

06:37.790 --> 06:39.335
I'd tell you but I'd have to kill you.

06:39.336 --> 06:40.836
Does he have any more, your source?

06:40.875 --> 06:42.758
He says he has a lot more.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.162
We've got a problem.

06:54.537 --> 06:56.136
Well, where you got that from,

06:56.152 --> 06:57.799
your timing was perfect.

06:59.913 --> 07:02.099
A little bit more of this stuff,

07:02.340 --> 07:04.464
and that bastard's
conviction will be assured.

07:04.483 --> 07:06.818
Oh, you would have got that
conviction no matter what.

07:09.004 --> 07:10.280
No, they've been clever.

07:10.793 --> 07:11.993
Really clever.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.952
It's been a good day, Sophie.

07:14.137 --> 07:17.585
- Thank you for it.
- No, thank you, Michel.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.951
And thank you for convincing
me to be your second.

07:22.883 --> 07:24.667
- Good night.
- Here.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.148
Good night, dear.

07:31.139 --> 07:33.976
- Sleep well.
- Oh, thank you, Jan.

07:34.007 --> 07:36.174
Take me home, I'm exhausted.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.024
_

07:50.480 --> 07:53.162
_

07:53.163 --> 07:55.734
- Hey... come, please.
- Basta! (Enough!)

08:08.432 --> 08:10.581
- Costante?
- Inspector Costante,

08:10.701 --> 08:12.340
my name is Michel Dorn,

08:12.396 --> 08:14.001
I'm the chief prosecutor

08:14.002 --> 08:16.295
for the International
Criminal Court at The Hague.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.636
How can I help you, Mr. Dorn?

08:17.685 --> 08:19.492
Miss Sophie Baines, my second,

08:19.504 --> 08:20.718
has been kidnapped.

08:20.838 --> 08:22.820
- When?
- 11 hours ago.

08:22.826 --> 08:24.641
Her chauffeur has been executed.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.932
A small bore bullet to his head.

08:26.963 --> 08:29.576
So you want me to advise
the investigator in charge?

08:29.595 --> 08:32.573
You are the best kidnapping
investigator in Europe.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.253
I want you on a plane.

08:55.582 --> 08:59.511
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, The Hague

09:07.989 --> 09:09.210
- Good morning.
- Morning.

09:09.222 --> 09:11.210
Inspector Marco Costante.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.335
Inspector Costante?

09:14.078 --> 09:15.874
Don't worry, I'll let him in.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.679
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

09:22.841 --> 09:24.181
It's an honour to meet you, sir.

09:24.182 --> 09:26.457
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate your help.

09:26.935 --> 09:27.982
I didn't get your name.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.552
Arabela Seeger, formerly
with the Rotterdam PD.

09:30.614 --> 09:31.983
You're with the Cross Border Unit?

09:32.103 --> 09:34.857
I was, until it was shut down 6 months ago.

09:34.906 --> 09:36.826
Yeah, I heard about Major Louis Daniel.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.350
That was a tragedy.

09:38.617 --> 09:41.453
- Yes, it was.
- What about the rest of your team?

09:41.503 --> 09:43.528
- Carl Hickman?
- You know Hickman?

09:43.571 --> 09:45.132
Only by reputation.

09:45.516 --> 09:46.885
He went home.

09:47.232 --> 09:48.644
As did the others.

09:48.764 --> 09:50.694
So you were the only one
who stayed with the court?

09:51.455 --> 09:52.818
That's right.

09:53.178 --> 09:53.971
Just me.

09:54.091 --> 09:56.430
What about your... forensic IT guy?

09:56.436 --> 09:57.533
I heard he was pretty good.

09:57.557 --> 09:59.372
- Sebastian Berger?
- Yeah.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.621
I haven't seen him in a while.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.764
Inspector Costante, Carine Strand.

10:18.279 --> 10:21.019
Carine is our senior
investigator for the court.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.843
He's ready to see us.

10:27.882 --> 10:29.939
The driver is Jan Ottendorf,

10:29.979 --> 10:32.223
killed at close range,
single shot to the head.

10:32.253 --> 10:33.729
No traceable fingerprints,

10:33.750 --> 10:35.769
forensics are running hair and fibre, but

10:35.850 --> 10:36.995
they're not hopeful.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.239
We did find this.

10:39.587 --> 10:41.187
- A mobile phone.
- Where?

10:41.192 --> 10:43.005
In a puddle on the passenger side.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.583
- Whose is it?
- The IT guys

10:44.584 --> 10:45.840
couldn't get anything off of it.

10:45.935 --> 10:47.965
There's too much water damage from the mud.

10:49.317 --> 10:50.769
Still no ransom demand?

10:50.889 --> 10:51.611
No.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.987
And the clock is ticking.

10:53.005 --> 10:54.482
We desperately need some answers.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.383
I gathered you think this, ah,

10:56.428 --> 10:58.390
dictator Wombosi took her.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.119
Everybody saw Sophie
walk into the courtroom

11:01.139 --> 11:02.005
with that evidence.

11:02.022 --> 11:04.445
And kidnapping is very
much Wombosi's style.

11:04.652 --> 11:06.907
He's made thousands of
his enemies disappear.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.244
What are your thoughts?

11:09.458 --> 11:10.523
Well, I think this

11:10.553 --> 11:12.926
whole attack was obviously premeditated.

11:13.595 --> 11:15.433
The driver stops in the muddy fields,

11:15.444 --> 11:16.970
6 kilometres from the victim's house,

11:16.971 --> 11:18.793
with no sign he was pursued...

11:18.807 --> 11:21.304
- You think someone got to him?
- I think they threatened him.

11:23.777 --> 11:25.545
Or more likely his family.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.613
They kill him anyway.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.995
Leaving no witnesses.

11:34.039 --> 11:35.307
Professionals.

11:43.889 --> 11:46.733
It'll be really helpful to
find out whose phone that is.

11:48.353 --> 11:49.810
What about your, ah,

11:49.930 --> 11:52.272
- IT guy, Sebastian?
- Berger.

11:54.966 --> 11:56.309
Do you wanna bring him in?

11:58.290 --> 11:59.490
Can you find him?

12:00.521 --> 12:02.359
I'll see what I can do.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.616
I have a text from Wombosi's lawyer.

12:07.736 --> 12:10.019
He'll accept questioning in camera.

12:11.248 --> 12:13.027
Would you like to have a look at him?

12:19.444 --> 12:20.846
Sophie's a...

12:20.966 --> 12:23.349
- close friend of Mr. Dorn, yeah?
- Very.

12:23.914 --> 12:27.040
She worked so hard to put
Wombosi away, it's, uh...

12:27.303 --> 12:28.542
it's personal to her.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.831
Well, I can understand that.

12:31.599 --> 12:34.289
I was sorry to hear about what happened.

12:35.235 --> 12:37.520
Your suspect, who shot himself.

12:38.618 --> 12:39.818
Thank you.

12:40.418 --> 12:42.147
You tracked him for a long time.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.610
Well, it's why I became a police officer.

12:44.893 --> 12:46.111
To find him.

12:47.414 --> 12:48.771
He was my, ah...

12:49.549 --> 12:51.229
last and best lead.

12:51.709 --> 12:53.497
All the other evidence had closed?

12:53.710 --> 12:56.787
My sister was abducted when
I was 12 years old, Inspector.

12:56.956 --> 12:59.215
The trail has gone very, very cold.

12:59.335 --> 13:00.886
You never stopped looking for her.

13:00.887 --> 13:02.087
I never will.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.171
No matter what it takes.

13:15.964 --> 13:17.783
I'll have someone get you some coffee.

13:18.625 --> 13:19.825
Thank you.

13:29.823 --> 13:31.616
Uh, black please, no sugar.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.441
Yes, uh, two coffees, black please.

13:35.561 --> 13:37.929
- Yes, ma'am.
- Elleanor Delfont-Bogard.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.920
But people usually just call me Ellie.

13:40.116 --> 13:41.316
And you are?

13:41.585 --> 13:43.775
I just graduated from
the Met Police Service

13:43.794 --> 13:46.138
with a degree in forensics psychology. I...

13:46.188 --> 13:47.867
hope you don't mind if I observe.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.068
And if I do?

13:51.917 --> 13:53.117
You can observe.

13:56.916 --> 13:59.413
We've come as you asked, Mr. Dorn.

13:59.453 --> 14:02.460
Thank you for agreeing to
speak with us, General Wombosi.

14:04.363 --> 14:06.003
What is this about, Ms. Strand?

14:06.042 --> 14:07.464
My second,

14:07.722 --> 14:09.382
Sophie Baines,

14:09.932 --> 14:11.711
went missing last night.

14:11.879 --> 14:14.867
- Is that so?
- Her driver was shot and killed.

14:14.911 --> 14:18.176
And you think my client had
something to do with this?

14:18.246 --> 14:20.077
- Are you saying he didn't?
- The smile.

14:20.122 --> 14:21.525
It's very telling, don't you th...

14:21.526 --> 14:24.167
- Of course, he didn't.
- But he knows who did.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.461
I assure you, Ms. Strand,

14:26.581 --> 14:28.923
my client had nothing to do with this.

14:29.043 --> 14:30.820
But you should not be surprised.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.333
God punished those who
persecute the mighty.

14:35.551 --> 14:37.954
Let me be absolutely clear:

14:38.118 --> 14:40.883
should any harm befall Ms. Baines,

14:42.047 --> 14:44.941
I will find out from whose hands it came,

14:45.788 --> 14:47.725
and they will pay a price.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.500
Oh, a price will be paid, Mr. Dorn.

14:50.882 --> 14:53.171
A very heavy price. By you,

14:53.246 --> 14:55.802
and by anyone who helps you.

14:58.057 --> 14:59.407
Go, go, go, go.

14:59.529 --> 15:00.767
Go. Yeah.

15:03.350 --> 15:04.550
Hi.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.075
Hey.

15:06.348 --> 15:08.023
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

15:08.344 --> 15:09.544
Thank you for coming.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.477
Hello.

15:11.982 --> 15:13.182
Do you remember me?

15:13.607 --> 15:16.119
- Arabela, right?
- Right.

15:17.136 --> 15:18.766
Um, could we talk over here?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.059
- Sure.
- Yeah. Thanks.

15:20.742 --> 15:22.387
We'll just be over there.

15:25.919 --> 15:27.673
- What's with you and...
- Kathrin.

15:27.723 --> 15:28.937
She got a new job.

15:28.986 --> 15:31.364
She's living in The Hague now, so, um...

15:31.365 --> 15:33.488
We've been alternating
weekends these past few months.

15:33.489 --> 15:35.744
That's amazing. Good for you, Sebastian.

15:35.759 --> 15:37.191
And you're still at the court?

15:37.221 --> 15:40.080
Investigating war crimes
for the court, yes.

15:40.122 --> 15:41.323
And yourself?

15:41.498 --> 15:43.509
I've been having a hard time finding a job.

15:43.584 --> 15:46.140
I guess I did a few too
many warrantless searches.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.250
Would you like a job?

15:47.652 --> 15:48.990
Are you serious?

15:49.505 --> 15:50.927
- Yes.
- But...

15:52.533 --> 15:53.895
What am I gonna do with him?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.759
ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands.

16:04.569 --> 16:06.204
- Morning.
- Hi.

16:06.563 --> 16:07.785
Want a cup?

16:12.187 --> 16:14.038
You're off to a late start today?

16:14.158 --> 16:16.150
Ah, I got hung up at the office.

16:16.416 --> 16:17.679
- Again?
- Hm.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.903
Pemberton doesn't seem to realise that

16:19.928 --> 16:22.641
Europe is 9 hours ahead of California.

16:24.056 --> 16:25.256
You OK?

16:26.363 --> 16:28.122
Yeah, fine.

16:29.565 --> 16:31.701
You seem on edge lately.

16:32.803 --> 16:35.027
Just got a lot on at work.

16:37.108 --> 16:39.141
More details from the court in The Hague...

16:39.201 --> 16:42.731
In his ongoing trial at the
International Criminal Court today,

16:42.851 --> 16:46.119
lawyers for General Wombosi
seemed caught off guard by the...

16:46.137 --> 16:47.337
Is this yours?

16:48.070 --> 16:50.479
Yeah. Been looking for that.

16:50.486 --> 16:52.567
Since when do you read The Hague Guardian?

16:53.705 --> 16:56.158
You know me, I like to stay well informed.

16:56.278 --> 16:58.795
Then don't forget the
doctors appointment tomorrow.

16:58.803 --> 16:59.909
I won't.

17:01.962 --> 17:03.670
I gotta get dressed.

17:04.271 --> 17:08.337
... with evidence to the effect
in the form of a series of emails.

17:08.564 --> 17:11.191
The African dictator is
accused of slaughtering

17:11.199 --> 17:15.154
hundreds of residents of
the Banui village, in 2013.

17:15.178 --> 17:17.790
A challenge to the admissibility
of evidence is expected

17:17.799 --> 17:20.491
when the trial resumes, and
questions are being asked

17:20.521 --> 17:24.328
about how Chief Prosecutor Michel
Dorn, obtained this evidence.

17:26.308 --> 17:28.860
A price will be paid, Mr. Dorn.

17:28.980 --> 17:31.417
A very heavy price. By you,

17:31.650 --> 17:33.863
and by anyone who helps you.

17:35.241 --> 17:37.218
That son of a bitch enjoyed that.

17:37.234 --> 17:38.919
Exactly what we might expect.

17:38.938 --> 17:41.703
Not just a complete lack of
empathy, but schadenfreude.

17:43.781 --> 17:47.342
Schadenfreude is German for pleasure
derived in seeing others suffer.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.437
He's a pathological
narcissist, wouldn't you say?

17:49.461 --> 17:51.557
I understand Miss Delfont-Bogard

17:51.587 --> 17:53.856
just, ah, graduated from
the Met Police Service.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.883
And was first in her class
in Cambridge before that.

17:56.903 --> 17:59.356
We like to mentor here, Inspector.

18:00.511 --> 18:01.724
What are your thoughts?

18:02.032 --> 18:03.776
The man's a monster, for sure,

18:03.795 --> 18:05.644
but he has nothing to do with this.

18:05.645 --> 18:06.845
Why not?

18:07.819 --> 18:10.301
If she was being held
to ensure an acquittal

18:10.361 --> 18:12.606
you would have received
some kind of a ransom demand.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.713
But we know that kidnapping is
straight out of his play book.

18:15.742 --> 18:18.705
Schadenfreude or not, he
was genuinely surprised

18:18.825 --> 18:20.212
when he heard she'd been taken.

18:20.747 --> 18:23.444
And kidnapping people in his
own country is one thing but

18:23.447 --> 18:26.559
in The Netherlands? No.
If he wanted her dead,

18:26.950 --> 18:28.238
why not just kill her?

18:28.358 --> 18:29.635
Very clear.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.908
- So who took her?
- And why?

18:33.358 --> 18:36.208
- There has to be a connection.
- Right, of course.

18:37.802 --> 18:39.610
Excuse me.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.236
You stupid, stupid girl.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.252
- Sebastian Berger.
- Carine Strand.

18:47.266 --> 18:48.621
This is Inspector Costante.

18:48.741 --> 18:50.024
- Hey.
- Good to meet you.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.694
I was able to clean up and
repair the central processors

18:52.695 --> 18:54.375
on the mobile phone found in the mud.

18:54.559 --> 18:55.759
It was a burner.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.084
Who dropped it?

18:57.277 --> 18:58.718
From the call list and GPS,

18:58.719 --> 19:01.253
I'd say it belonged to
your missing prosecutor.

19:01.370 --> 19:03.492
It's looking like Sophie
had a throwaway phone.

19:03.499 --> 19:04.360
I didn't know that.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.521
Well, the question remains,

19:05.534 --> 19:06.859
what was she doing with a throwaway?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.853
We think she was afraid someone
might hack her work phone.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.087
Why would you think that?

19:11.300 --> 19:12.340
Because,

19:12.460 --> 19:13.985
someone did.

19:15.181 --> 19:17.193
I've already alerted your IT guys.

19:17.252 --> 19:18.897
It wasn't just Sophie's phone, but

19:18.932 --> 19:21.489
Dorn's, Arabela's and
yours Inspector Strand.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.639
I can see that Mr. Berger.

19:23.759 --> 19:24.760
Who's hacking us?

19:24.781 --> 19:26.722
Well, I can't identify the IP address, but

19:26.751 --> 19:28.079
whoever he is,

19:28.123 --> 19:29.880
he's got to be pretty sophisticated

19:29.912 --> 19:31.483
to get past the ICC firewall.

19:31.524 --> 19:33.684
There's a fifth number being hacked.

19:33.734 --> 19:34.908
Yeah, someone in London.

19:34.952 --> 19:35.905
Luke Wilkinson,

19:35.926 --> 19:38.655
he's an inspector working
for the Metropolitan Police.

19:39.065 --> 19:40.918
Do we know how he's connected?

19:40.928 --> 19:42.152
I can find out.

19:42.439 --> 19:44.723
Can you send me his details to my phone?

19:45.313 --> 19:46.398
You're being hacked.

19:46.438 --> 19:47.890
My personal phone.

19:47.935 --> 19:49.135
Doing it now.

19:49.203 --> 19:50.937
- Would you care for a drive?
- Where to?

19:51.007 --> 19:52.637
- Sophie Baines' house.
- Let's go.

19:52.761 --> 19:53.961
Thank you.

19:54.218 --> 19:56.864
- Nice to meet you Mr. Berger.
- And you.

19:57.169 --> 19:59.183
So where are you from
originally, Miss Strand?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.475
Born and raised, Minnesota. But I
was ten years with the Chicago PD.

20:02.506 --> 20:06.035
- What brought you to Europe?
- I came to consult on a case. I never left.

20:06.155 --> 20:07.914
- You like it here?
- I love it.

20:07.921 --> 20:10.021
In the way only an American could.

20:10.061 --> 20:12.256
Not that I have time for sightseeing.

20:12.287 --> 20:15.437
- Your live for your work.
- I'm afraid so.

20:15.689 --> 20:18.587
I was touched by violence
too when I was very young.

20:22.546 --> 20:24.243
What is it we're looking for, Inspector?

20:24.262 --> 20:25.500
I'm not sure.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.972
But I know Sophie didn't
drop the burner by accident.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.713
I was thinking the same thing.

20:29.731 --> 20:30.666
She left it,

20:30.691 --> 20:32.444
- hoping we'd find it.
- Yeah.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.058
And hoping it would help us find her.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.270
What?

20:40.774 --> 20:41.974
Nothing.

21:02.352 --> 21:03.616
Single mother.

21:03.617 --> 21:04.817
Widowed.

21:05.604 --> 21:06.917
War veteran.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.579
- Impressive woman.
- Very.

21:15.372 --> 21:16.394
What?

21:16.395 --> 21:17.622
Maybe nothing.

21:18.307 --> 21:19.806
It's The Hague Guardian.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.113
He took the paper!

21:59.527 --> 22:00.727
I got him!

22:01.500 --> 22:02.993
I'll go 'round!

22:25.342 --> 22:26.542
Get out!

22:35.799 --> 22:37.834
_

22:38.075 --> 22:40.805
_

22:56.873 --> 22:58.073
Thanks.

23:10.628 --> 23:12.318
Inspector Wilkinson?

23:16.498 --> 23:17.698
Yeah.

23:18.069 --> 23:20.892
Sir, Arabela Seeger with the ICC.

23:21.084 --> 23:22.284
The ICC?

23:22.534 --> 23:24.776
- In The Hague?
- Do you have a minute?

23:24.831 --> 23:27.383
Sure. Give us five.

23:33.701 --> 23:35.736
Tracking me down here on a Saturday.

23:36.073 --> 23:37.235
It must be pretty important.

23:37.252 --> 23:39.232
A prosecutor was kidnapped last night.

23:39.263 --> 23:40.576
Sophie Baines.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.685
She's been assisting in the
trial of Fabrice Wombosi.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.579
The wannabe Idi Amin.

23:45.635 --> 23:47.592
Yeah, I've heard of him.

23:48.979 --> 23:51.135
Look, what's this about, Ms. Seeger?

23:51.172 --> 23:54.715
Whoever kidnapped Ms.
Baines, hacked several phones,

23:55.266 --> 23:57.322
- including yours.
- Mine?

23:57.786 --> 24:00.288
- Why?
- You've a military background, Inspector,

24:00.294 --> 24:01.911
five years in the army.

24:02.418 --> 24:04.314
Yeah. Marksman.

24:04.345 --> 24:07.719
But I was never posted anywhere near
Africa. If that's where you're headed.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.451
What about any of your
open cases now with the Met.

24:10.571 --> 24:12.184
I've got plenty, take your pick.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.496
- How many's plenty?
- Uh, I dunno, a dozen maybe.

24:14.805 --> 24:17.249
But I think I'd know if
any were to do with Wombosi.

24:19.797 --> 24:22.498
I hate to ruin your weekend, Inspector, but

24:22.618 --> 24:24.745
I'm gonna need you to fly back with me.

24:24.865 --> 24:25.884
What for?

24:25.897 --> 24:28.907
You are connected to
this case in some way, and

24:28.912 --> 24:30.529
we need to find out how.

24:30.946 --> 24:32.649
_

24:33.165 --> 24:34.584
_

24:35.844 --> 24:37.044
Yes.

24:37.173 --> 24:38.471
You wanted to see me?

24:42.076 --> 24:43.686
What is it, Michel?

24:45.755 --> 24:47.426
Wombosi's lawyer has challenged

24:47.443 --> 24:48.976
the evidence Sophie gave us.

24:49.025 --> 24:51.118
If we don't have her source to back it up,

24:51.298 --> 24:52.951
he will have it thrown out.

24:52.988 --> 24:55.212
We have no idea who gave
her that information.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.460
We have to find out who.

24:56.676 --> 24:58.104
And fast.

24:59.055 --> 25:00.255
Carine,

25:00.262 --> 25:03.554
I had them put the boxes in the
conference room, I hope that's OK.

25:03.591 --> 25:05.331
- It's perfect.
- What are they?

25:05.451 --> 25:07.760
Ah, Sophie's files from the Wombosi case.

25:07.772 --> 25:10.280
We're gonna go through them, page by page.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.677
Inspector Costante said
he didn't think Wombosi

25:12.689 --> 25:14.399
had anything to do with her abduction.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.638
He may be right.

25:15.853 --> 25:19.012
In which case, someone else
really wants her evidence.

25:19.347 --> 25:21.620
Someone else had a motive.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.602
For kidnapping Sophie.

25:24.339 --> 25:26.160
Did you manage to get any sleep yet?

25:26.203 --> 25:27.708
I'll sleep later.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.737
I feel a little silly

25:32.960 --> 25:35.041
about the schadenfreude incident.

25:35.790 --> 25:38.094
I was just trying to hard again, I guess.

25:38.862 --> 25:40.305
Ellie, listen to me.

25:40.696 --> 25:42.312
A professional killer

25:42.432 --> 25:44.307
shot Sophie's driver in cold blood,

25:44.319 --> 25:47.174
and if we don't find her, he
will very likely kill her too.

25:47.192 --> 25:49.075
And we will spend the rest of our lives

25:49.106 --> 25:51.175
knowing that we failed to save her.

25:51.205 --> 25:53.739
You can't try too hard.

25:54.147 --> 25:56.705
None of us can possibly try hard enough.

25:57.268 --> 25:58.468
OK?

27:09.879 --> 27:11.874
You must be Sebastian Berger.

27:12.183 --> 27:14.686
No. Everybody makes that mistake.

27:14.722 --> 27:15.831
Are you sure?

27:15.850 --> 27:18.042
'Cause I've bought a hot
chocolate for Sebastian.

27:18.061 --> 27:21.201
- I'd hate to see it go to waste.
- I'm Erik, his son.

27:21.321 --> 27:23.741
Erik, of course. Well,

27:23.821 --> 27:25.883
I don't that your father
would mind, do you?

27:26.405 --> 27:28.312
- Not at all.
- OK.

27:28.665 --> 27:30.826
- Thank you.
- You're most welcome.

27:31.756 --> 27:35.218
Elleanor Delfont-Bogard.
But please, call me Ellie.

27:35.255 --> 27:37.126
- Thanks for that, Ellie.
- Not a problem.

27:37.151 --> 27:39.368
It's an honour to meet you, Mr. Berger.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.032
An honour?

27:41.251 --> 27:43.344
Well, yes, your infiltration

27:43.345 --> 27:45.259
of the Cavalier Motorcycle Club alone

27:45.283 --> 27:46.935
should be taught to cadets.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.492
How do you know about this?

27:48.503 --> 27:50.731
I've studied all Cross Border Unit cases.

27:51.024 --> 27:53.440
You're a very impressive
person, Mr. Berger.

27:54.610 --> 27:57.607
Police work's a pretty unusual
career for your background.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.704
- The accent, right?
- And the surname.

28:01.788 --> 28:03.745
Your father's at the World Bank, isn't he?

28:03.931 --> 28:06.830
He doesn't exactly approve
of my career choice.

28:07.171 --> 28:08.371
But you

28:08.372 --> 28:10.936
were attracted to the long hours, low pay

28:10.954 --> 28:12.447
and lack of prestige.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.686
Well, I suppose I just
wanted to make a difference.

28:15.692 --> 28:17.469
Not just by writing cheques.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.829
What is that?

28:20.956 --> 28:22.728
Uh, satellite scanner.

28:22.759 --> 28:24.481
The burner phone that Sophie dropped.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.240
That'll pick it up.

28:28.823 --> 28:31.146
And how are you getting
on with the newspapers?

28:31.702 --> 28:34.960
Running analytical metrics. Page by page.

28:35.139 --> 28:36.440
What are you looking for?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.146
Something worth stealing
The Hague Guardian for.

28:41.215 --> 28:42.912
Was that the man they chased?

28:43.543 --> 28:44.949
Yeah, that's him.

28:44.955 --> 28:47.593
Inspector Strand managed to
snap his photo as he drove off.

28:47.637 --> 28:48.977
And you can ID him from that?

28:48.990 --> 28:51.663
The resolution is a little
soft at this distance

28:51.891 --> 28:53.328
but I'm working on it.

28:54.564 --> 28:56.522
I've sharpened the resolution here.

28:56.764 --> 28:58.417
Yes, that's him.

28:58.484 --> 29:01.518
What about the car outside
Sophie's house, with German plates?

29:01.706 --> 29:03.725
Stolen from a car hire in Hannover.

29:03.768 --> 29:05.886
So we're looking for a German national?

29:05.936 --> 29:07.924
Stolen from a car hire in Hannover,

29:07.925 --> 29:09.968
not necessarily by a German national.

29:10.018 --> 29:11.828
Yes, but we should still get a description

29:11.844 --> 29:13.506
of Sophie to the Hannover police.

29:13.548 --> 29:14.948
- Doing it now.
- Good.

29:16.211 --> 29:19.178
This is Inspector Wilkinson,
from the London Met.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.274
Glad you could come over, Inspector.

29:22.473 --> 29:24.058
Michel Dorn. Sit down.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.802
Do you recognize this man?

29:27.750 --> 29:29.428
Uh, should I?

29:29.548 --> 29:31.253
We ran into him this afternoon,

29:31.270 --> 29:33.487
stealing newspapers from
Sophie Baines apartment.

29:33.745 --> 29:35.382
Sorry, I've never seen him before.

29:35.628 --> 29:36.828
Figures.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.201
I have.

29:39.471 --> 29:40.099
And fast.

29:40.149 --> 29:42.032
- Where?
- In the court.

29:42.152 --> 29:43.462
Wombosi's trial.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.630
We should check CCTV.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.427
- I can show him.
- Good.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.361
Sorry, you said "figures"?

29:58.481 --> 30:00.404
You don't think I know this guy.

30:01.811 --> 30:03.657
- No.
- Why not?

30:03.977 --> 30:05.177
I checked.

30:05.323 --> 30:06.989
No one's called you from The Hague.

30:07.032 --> 30:09.076
You checked my calls?

30:09.460 --> 30:11.485
Was there a court order or my consent?

30:12.847 --> 30:14.835
- Are you telling me you mind?
- Yeah.

30:14.867 --> 30:16.836
- That's exactly what I'm telling you.
- A life is in danger,

30:16.855 --> 30:18.608
- every second counts.
- Please,

30:18.728 --> 30:21.079
accept our apology, of course,

30:21.134 --> 30:23.265
we should have asked for your permission.

30:23.385 --> 30:26.591
Sebastian will erase all data
that he collected immediately.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.499
He already did.

30:28.685 --> 30:29.942
Appreciate that.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.479
Inspector Wilkinson, can we review some of

30:32.483 --> 30:34.170
Wombosi's holdings in the UK?

30:34.525 --> 30:37.052
I'd like to see if any of
them mean anything to you.

30:37.172 --> 30:38.730
Yeah, good idea.

30:42.936 --> 30:44.261
That was fun.

30:48.026 --> 30:49.816
Don't take it personally.

30:52.219 --> 30:53.941
Was that Marco Costante?

30:54.061 --> 30:55.564
Yes, why?

30:55.684 --> 30:58.091
I heard he retired. After that shooting.

30:58.951 --> 31:02.322
We were told he took leave
of absence. What shooting?

31:02.667 --> 31:03.886
I don't know the details,

31:03.907 --> 31:06.294
just that some suspect
killed himself a month ago.

31:14.534 --> 31:15.810
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:15.847 --> 31:17.364
I need your help with something.

31:18.238 --> 31:20.164
Have any idea what this is?

31:22.300 --> 31:23.500
No.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.182
Is it connected to our case?

31:25.665 --> 31:27.635
No. Personal.

31:31.419 --> 31:34.256
16 spokes emanating from the centre.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.664
Same images on the Indian flag.

31:37.091 --> 31:39.092
Right. Saw that on Google.

31:41.043 --> 31:42.746
I can try to dig deeper if you want.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.437
I'll call you if I find something.

31:44.557 --> 31:46.320
Thanks, man, appreciate it.

32:38.653 --> 32:40.774
Hello?

32:45.759 --> 32:47.788
Hello?

32:49.225 --> 32:50.344
Hello?

32:50.464 --> 32:51.931
Hello?!

32:59.096 --> 33:00.933
Hoping I was someone else?

33:09.758 --> 33:10.958
Dad?

33:11.672 --> 33:12.872
Hey.

33:14.638 --> 33:16.094
Time to sleep.

33:16.859 --> 33:18.126
You OK?

33:18.869 --> 33:20.981
Why can't I go to Mum's?

33:22.133 --> 33:23.347
Because,

33:23.539 --> 33:25.287
I told you, she's out of town.

33:25.843 --> 33:27.048
And, um,

33:27.242 --> 33:28.989
I wasn't really expecting this.

33:30.203 --> 33:32.198
Can you come up? Now.

33:32.318 --> 33:34.193
- What is it?
- The man in Sophie's house,

33:34.236 --> 33:35.506
we've got a name.

33:37.302 --> 33:38.949
Sweet dreams.

33:39.602 --> 33:40.802
Sleep.

33:43.204 --> 33:45.136
- Who is he?
- Robert Penny.

33:45.180 --> 33:48.227
- How did you find his name?
- I didn't. Inspector Costante did.

33:48.239 --> 33:49.895
- Nice.
- He used a false passport

33:49.896 --> 33:51.107
to sign into the court.

33:51.442 --> 33:54.359
But his own credit card paid
for petrol for that stolen car

33:54.379 --> 33:56.286
in the station 2 kilometres away.

33:56.323 --> 33:57.259
What have you got?

33:57.277 --> 33:59.204
Robert Penny. War veteran.

33:59.228 --> 34:02.606
He did 7 tours in Iraq, then
left the Royal Navy in 2010.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.492
He's been working as a
gun for hire ever since

34:04.508 --> 34:06.478
for those private security contractors.

34:06.927 --> 34:08.389
I know that one.

34:08.509 --> 34:11.021
- Which one?
- Melvoy Security.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.753
They've got offices all over the
world but their chief of security

34:13.797 --> 34:16.379
Dominic Fitzroy is based out of Amsterdam.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.713
What was your business with him?

34:18.726 --> 34:22.181
Uh, I had a few routine questions
about one of his clients, Argento.

34:22.243 --> 34:24.293
Argento? They make smartphones.

34:24.324 --> 34:26.844
Yep, smartphones, other mobile devices.

34:26.876 --> 34:29.795
Had some suspicious high value
bank accounts out of London.

34:29.824 --> 34:32.500
What the hell does Wombosi
have to do with smartphones?

34:32.551 --> 34:34.147
I bet Sophie could tell us.

34:34.266 --> 34:36.067
Or at least her source could.

34:43.603 --> 34:46.042
_

34:46.634 --> 34:49.223
_

35:07.166 --> 35:08.733
Who are you working for?

35:11.390 --> 35:13.180
You can talk to me, you know.

35:17.787 --> 35:19.032
Eat.

35:37.487 --> 35:38.687
Not bad.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.169
You know, I wouldn't have
chosen eggs for my last meal.

35:45.725 --> 35:47.732
It is my last meal, isn't it?

35:51.306 --> 35:52.780
You killed my driver.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.576
You strand me here.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.034
You're just waiting on orders to kill me.

36:00.162 --> 36:02.986
You're just a man who follows orders.

36:03.741 --> 36:06.058
Did you learn that in the Navy?

36:06.178 --> 36:08.554
What were you? Special Forces?

36:10.455 --> 36:11.830
And how do you know that?

36:12.084 --> 36:13.608
Tattoo on your arm.

36:15.014 --> 36:16.490
I was in the Navy too.

36:17.696 --> 36:19.102
7 years.

36:19.995 --> 36:21.339
Sorry Miss Baines.

36:22.218 --> 36:24.001
We're on opposite sides on this one.

36:40.662 --> 36:43.437
- Costante? Where are you going?
- Amsterdam.

36:43.473 --> 36:45.117
Inspector Wilkinson and I are going to see

36:45.126 --> 36:46.839
this security contractor, Fitzroy.

36:46.849 --> 36:48.298
We're running out of time.

36:48.341 --> 36:51.209
If we don't hurry up and find
Sophie Baines, they will kill her.

36:51.246 --> 36:54.256
You realize this isn't about
Sophie Baines, Mr. Dorn?

36:54.288 --> 36:57.174
- She's just the means to an end.
- To her source, I know.

36:57.205 --> 36:58.883
And I know that that's why

36:58.902 --> 37:01.726
Wombosi's lawyer challenged
the evidence that she gave us.

37:01.727 --> 37:04.272
If we don't find backup for it in 48 hours

37:04.273 --> 37:06.050
they will have it thrown out of court.

37:06.261 --> 37:07.946
And you still don't think

37:07.977 --> 37:10.906
- that Wombosi is behind her kidnapping?
- I don't.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.783
Oh, I'm sure there's a connection.

37:13.111 --> 37:15.137
Look, I know she's a friend of yours,

37:15.162 --> 37:17.391
I understand how difficult this is.

37:17.511 --> 37:19.980
I will not have her blood on my hands.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.777
I cannot.

37:22.736 --> 37:24.142
We'll find her.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.413
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands

37:42.067 --> 37:43.455
Nice place.

37:43.727 --> 37:45.845
Being a gun for hire pays well.

37:47.380 --> 37:49.498
Inspectors Costante and Wilkinson.

37:49.535 --> 37:50.959
We were expecting you.

37:50.984 --> 37:53.220
May I offer you some tea? Coffee?

37:53.430 --> 37:56.440
- Uh, black...
- We'd just like to see Mr. Fitzroy.

37:56.490 --> 37:58.230
Of course. Right this way.

37:59.438 --> 38:01.166
A bloke could get used to this.

38:03.396 --> 38:06.492
We provide services for
clients all over the world.

38:07.081 --> 38:09.552
General Wombosi isn't one of them.

38:10.624 --> 38:13.095
Someone hacked Miss Baines' phone.

38:13.565 --> 38:15.640
And several others, including mine.

38:15.974 --> 38:17.114
Now,

38:17.683 --> 38:19.944
we think that it may have been this man.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.782
Robert Penny.

38:27.104 --> 38:28.176
You know him?

38:28.561 --> 38:29.700
Of course.

38:29.820 --> 38:31.800
He's worked for me occasionally.

38:31.844 --> 38:33.213
But not recently.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.591
Do you have any idea
how we could locate him?

38:35.628 --> 38:38.322
Personnel files are protected information.

38:38.353 --> 38:39.424
Sorry, but,

38:39.926 --> 38:41.864
I can't share those with you.

38:42.130 --> 38:44.533
See, I'm particularly curious

38:44.546 --> 38:46.460
why he might have hacked my phone,

38:46.580 --> 38:48.125
Mr. Fitzroy.

38:48.918 --> 38:50.380
Last time we spoke

38:50.404 --> 38:52.783
it was about one of your clients,

38:52.903 --> 38:54.826
Argento International.

38:57.557 --> 39:00.709
And because this man
worked for me in the past,

39:00.889 --> 39:03.385
you think there might be
some connection between

39:03.428 --> 39:05.843
Argento and this kidnapping.

39:10.929 --> 39:13.326
I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but

39:13.446 --> 39:14.769
I can assure you

39:14.943 --> 39:17.048
there's no connection whatsoever.

39:17.779 --> 39:20.591
If I come across any
information that might be useful

39:20.622 --> 39:22.177
I'll share it with you at once.

39:26.109 --> 39:29.064
- He's lying.
- Oh, yeah, he is!

39:36.891 --> 39:38.091
Well?

39:38.189 --> 39:41.555
- We've got trouble, Mr. Pemberton.
- Can you contain it?

39:44.893 --> 39:46.348
We won't have to.

39:46.468 --> 39:47.879
For much longer.

40:17.258 --> 40:18.519
Come on, start...

40:19.177 --> 40:20.377
start!

40:22.319 --> 40:24.654
You'll need gasoline to start the engine.

40:25.527 --> 40:27.912
You didn't think I'd be
that careless, did you?

40:51.258 --> 40:52.998
- Well?
- Well,

40:53.011 --> 40:55.600
that guy, Fitzroy's got
one hell of a poker-face.

40:55.624 --> 40:57.129
- I'll give him that.
- What have you got?

40:57.249 --> 41:00.134
We've gone through everything
there is to know about Argento,

41:00.152 --> 41:01.954
Melvoy Security and Wombosi.

41:01.955 --> 41:05.609
If there is a connection, they've
been careful to keep it offline.

41:05.925 --> 41:07.125
Dad?

41:08.013 --> 41:10.707
Didn't realize you were
running a crèche, Sebastian.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.255
What are you doing up?

41:12.286 --> 41:14.119
Back to bed. Let's go.

41:14.491 --> 41:17.322
- It keeps beeping.
- What?

41:18.567 --> 41:21.274
- What is it?
- It's a VHF signal.

41:21.394 --> 41:23.769
Someone calling the number
for Sophie's burner phone.

41:23.889 --> 41:25.844
Comes from a quarry outside of Hannover.

41:25.845 --> 41:26.933
Sophie?

41:27.132 --> 41:28.891
She's calling her own phone.

41:29.504 --> 41:31.554
I'll get the chopper. Let's go.

42:00.839 --> 42:02.319
How far are we?

42:02.384 --> 42:03.818
Less than 2 kilometres.

42:03.854 --> 42:07.440
- I have the live feed up, over there.
- I'll contact emergency services.

42:10.221 --> 42:11.956
You don't have to kill me.

42:12.525 --> 42:15.413
I've got a daughter,
just let me go, please!

42:15.705 --> 42:18.124
You were a hero before, be a hero again.

42:18.143 --> 42:20.335
Is that what you think I
was back there in the desert?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.106
A hero?

42:26.338 --> 42:27.538
- Move.
- No.

42:27.539 --> 42:29.075
- Get up! Get up!
- No!

42:29.342 --> 42:31.076
Get on the fucking boat, you bitch!

42:33.949 --> 42:35.453
Move in closer.

42:45.351 --> 42:46.635
Where is she?

42:50.963 --> 42:52.963
- Come on! Move!
- Please!

42:53.142 --> 42:54.342
Come on!

43:00.830 --> 43:03.352
He gets into that boat, she's dead.

43:03.842 --> 43:05.060
Please.

43:05.604 --> 43:07.078
Just think what you're doing.

43:10.881 --> 43:12.865
This is a tough shot, Inspector.

43:20.909 --> 43:22.148
I've got it.

43:23.491 --> 43:25.132
- Get on the boat!
- Let me go.

43:25.151 --> 43:27.380
- Keep moving.
- Do it, now!

43:27.424 --> 43:28.821
He's moving too much.

43:42.555 --> 43:43.961
God!

43:48.241 --> 43:50.086
Nice shot, Inspector.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.720
Sophie,

44:14.110 --> 44:15.523
it's all right.

44:17.647 --> 44:19.481
You're going to be all right.

44:20.186 --> 44:21.431
Trust me.

44:22.112 --> 44:23.369
Miss Baines?

44:23.976 --> 44:26.676
I'm so sorry, but, we don't have much time.

44:26.863 --> 44:28.873
We have less than 48 hours before

44:28.874 --> 44:31.736
your evidence against Wombosi
is thrown out of court.

44:32.982 --> 44:35.602
They kidnapped me to keep
me away from my source.

44:35.722 --> 44:38.277
The one who gave me the
evidence against Wombosi.

44:38.284 --> 44:39.646
We figured as much.

44:39.766 --> 44:41.071
How can we find them?

44:42.186 --> 44:44.422
I don't even know his name.
