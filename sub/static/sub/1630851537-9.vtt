00:11.970 --> 00:15.432
"Adrian looks into the mirror and wonders,

00:15.932 --> 00:21.146
is this all a dream,
a figment of her imagination?"

00:22.063 --> 00:23.356
No, that sucks.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.901
Gary, that's twice in two days.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.238
You keep falling asleep in that sauna,
you're gonna cook yourself.

00:31.656 --> 00:35.702
Is your computer pressuring you to update?
Just click, "Remind me tomorrow."

00:35.785 --> 00:37.412
You won't do it then, either.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.041
No, I'm just frustrated.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.501
I'm writing a short story. Or trying to.

00:43.585 --> 00:47.255
That's cool. Short stories
are my favorite length of stories.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.299
You won't be reading this one.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.427
I have the worst writer's block
I've ever had.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.429
Give it time. You'll get there.

00:54.512 --> 00:55.847
I don't have time, Grant.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.183
I'm trying to submit
to the Harvard Review,

00:58.266 --> 01:01.061
and the deadline is soon,
and I can't come up with an ending.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.604
You can't, huh?

01:02.687 --> 01:04.272
Oh, good. Michael.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.568
Can you wrap me in these towels
and bury me under the free weights?

01:10.320 --> 01:13.740
I mean, I could,
but I'd have to run it by HR.

01:15.950 --> 01:19.162
Chelsea, I could develop
a workout program for you.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.955
Clear that writer's block up.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.582
That's a very kind offer,

01:22.665 --> 01:26.211
but I can't imagine working out
will clear my writer's block.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.923
I wouldn't be so sure.
You see that lady doing chest flies?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.175
-Yeah.
-That's Athena.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.637
She's an astrophysicist
who was blocked on some project,

01:35.720 --> 01:37.639
until she worked out with Grant.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.682
In a week, she discovered a quantum realm.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.267
Impressive, huh?

01:41.351 --> 01:44.479
I was proud of myself
when I discovered Santa Monica.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.650
Hey, Grant. How's my miracle worker?

01:48.733 --> 01:52.195
Doing great. Was telling Chelsea
about your breakthrough.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.322
Oh, yeah. One week with this guy,

01:54.405 --> 01:58.201
and suddenly,
I'm changing the course of human history.

01:59.536 --> 02:03.331
I call him MacArthur Genius Grant,
because he helped me win one.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.085
You mind handing me a fresh towel?

02:07.168 --> 02:10.338
Sure. They're not folded yet, sorry.

02:10.421 --> 02:15.385
Actually, every element in matter
is folded billions of times over.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.846
Grant helped me figure that one out
on week two.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.682
Not to mention
what he did for my pelvic floor.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.854
So, what do you say?

02:26.354 --> 02:30.692
Okay, I'm in, but we have to start now
'cause my deadline's in three days.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.527
I still have Maureen on my schedule.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.486
Screw Maureen!

02:34.362 --> 02:36.156
Hi, Maureen! Cute top.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.837
Thank you, Howard.
Another delicious brunch.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.797
We don't serve brunch on Tuesdays.

02:52.881 --> 02:57.051
What you just had, Jayden, was
a single banana and a lot of cocktails.

02:58.386 --> 03:02.891
It's really fun hanging out like this.
You've been so busy lately, Solana.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.560
I know.
Energy work has been in high demand

03:05.643 --> 03:08.354
ever since J.Lo claimed
it's why she doesn't have wrinkles.

03:11.065 --> 03:11.941
Allison, hi.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.236
Hi! What?

03:16.738 --> 03:20.742
-Funny bumping into you--
-Well, okay then, you must be on your way.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.329
Okay. I'll leave you to your meal.
See you tomorrow.

03:24.412 --> 03:29.667
Yes! Tomorrow is
certainly, yes, a day, that is for sure.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.085
Bye.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.003
Bye.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.966
-What was that?
-Did that guy just call you Allison?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.594
Allison? Do I look like an Allison to you?

03:39.677 --> 03:41.262
-No way.
-Who was that guy?

03:41.346 --> 03:44.349
-What guy?
-The guy talking to you.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.852
And ignoring me,
even though my hair is amazing. That guy.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.564
What are you talking about?
You guys are being really weird.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.907
Okay, all right.
I'm ready to "shred," as they say.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.951
So what do you wanna start with?

04:03.660 --> 04:04.494
Nope.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.997
Some push-ups? Some pull-ups?

04:08.081 --> 04:11.709
Ooh, that thing I saw on TV where men
in kilts throw telephone poles over walls?

04:12.877 --> 04:16.130
-Nope. We'll start on the treadmill.
-Oh, okay. Great.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.551
-Fire me up. Crank me to 11.
-I'm not turning it on.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.304
Just walk forwards and backwards.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.598
Walk on a motionless treadmill?

04:25.682 --> 04:29.185
While keeping your eye on this can
the entire time.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.815
-This is how Athena had her breakthrough?
-No.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.734
Athena did
high-intensity cardio kickboxing.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.945
You're gonna walk
on a powered-off treadmill.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.947
While staring at a can.

04:41.030 --> 04:41.906
Begin.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.616
Okay.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.249
-How will this help me--?
-Be back in an hour.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.042
-Hour?
-Eye on the can.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.088
Oh, why keep my eye on the can?
Okay. Jeez!

05:01.968 --> 05:05.430
I can't get over
how strange Solana was acting earlier.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.807
Pretending not to know that guy.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.726
Yeah, what was with that Allison stuff?

05:09.809 --> 05:13.313
Don't get me wrong.
I get mistaken for people all the time.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.566
Once, someone thought I was the alpaca
that looks like Tilda Swinton.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.487
It felt like Solana was hiding something.
I mean, who was that man?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.198
Maybe he's a celebrity client,

05:24.282 --> 05:27.327
and she uses a fake name
to protect his anonymity.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.787
Claire, there are only a handful
of famous bald men,

05:29.871 --> 05:31.914
and they're all
in the Fast & Furious movies.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.583
That guy was not one of them.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.877
Unless it was Tyrese.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.211
Was that Tyrese?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.923
-There is another possibility.
-What?

05:43.134 --> 05:46.095
Okay, hear me out. She could be in a cult.

05:46.846 --> 05:47.889
Do you think?

05:47.972 --> 05:50.391
Jayden, I have to tell you something.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.311
When I first got to L.A.,
I was desperate to make friends.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.772
So I fell into a group
of super nice, super hot people

05:55.855 --> 05:57.774
and, well, one thing led to another.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.902
And what I'm trying to say is,
I was in a cult.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.362
No way.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.155
Me too!

06:04.864 --> 06:06.574
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

06:06.657 --> 06:07.700
Wait, which one?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.744
Okay, on three.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.413
Sun Collective. Oh, my God!

06:12.497 --> 06:17.126
I knew we were solstice sisters.
Wait, when were you there, girl?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
-I took my vow in 2016.
-Ah. 2015.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.464
Wait, how did we not run into each other?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.174
I was a year ahead of you.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.717
Year one was all fun and games,

06:24.801 --> 06:27.804
but year two was entirely devoted
to digging the Infinity Hole.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.098
Year two was a nightmare.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.683
During one of my digging sessions,
I found a collarbone.

06:33.684 --> 06:37.355
Jayden, I'm scared for Solana.
I think she might be in a cult.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.441
That guy at Franklin's
did have a super cult-y look.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.861
Loose fitting jeans,
New Balances, no pop of color.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.448
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

06:47.532 --> 06:51.744
You're right. The last time we jumped
to conclusions, we joined a cult.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.206
Maybe we should investigate to confirm.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.292
Great. If there's one thing we learned
in the Sun Collective,

06:58.376 --> 07:01.629
it's how to uncover secrets
our loved ones are hiding.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.763
-My cult name was Rainbow. What was yours?
-Judy.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.773
Ow, ow.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.984
Ow, ow.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.694
Ow.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.696
Can't believe I'm sore from walking.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.450
It's the backwards part.
Most people walk forwards.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.705
-Ready to get back to the gym?
-No, Grant. I'm not.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.459
Feel like I was
zipped up in a sleeping bag

07:39.542 --> 07:40.835
and thrown down the stairs.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.879
That's typical after a workout.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.465
Walking on a shut-off treadmill

07:45.548 --> 07:48.050
while staring at a can is not a workout.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.053
That's a performance art piece
by a college freshman.

07:51.762 --> 07:55.725
I lost an entire day, and I still
don't have an ending to my story.

07:56.225 --> 08:01.689
Thank you for your help, but I'll just
tell the Review I won't be submitting.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.899
Unacceptable!

08:03.900 --> 08:05.985
-What are you doing?
-I'm not letting you quit.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.071
You made a promise to yourself.
Don't make promises you can't keep.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.657
Don't make promises you can't keep?
Grant, I can't--

08:11.741 --> 08:15.286
I'm not Grant.
I'm your trainer, named Grant.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.288
Now, quit whining,

08:17.371 --> 08:20.374
put on your Harvard sweatshirt
so everyone knows you went there,

08:20.458 --> 08:21.918
and get to the gym.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.922
Wow, that was very intense
but kind of exciting.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.257
-Are you like this with all--?
-No more questions!

08:28.341 --> 08:32.011
Okay. All right. Listen,
just to say, the Harvard sweatshirt,

08:32.094 --> 08:34.222
it's not to show off,
it's just comfortable--

08:34.305 --> 08:36.599
I said, go.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.643
-Where did the whistle come from?
-Now!

08:38.726 --> 08:40.102
Okay. Fine.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.979
Come on, go. Come on!

08:42.063 --> 08:44.899
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.075
What do you think she's reading?

08:54.158 --> 08:57.370
Probably the cult by-laws.
I read them for hours.

08:57.453 --> 09:01.916
Not to brag, but I won
the by-law trivia bee. Unopposed.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.504
Ooh, she's getting a phone call.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.589
Hey. Yeah.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.176
Look, this will all be over soon,

09:12.260 --> 09:15.513
and the final judgment
will be better than anything.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.764
Final judgment!

09:16.847 --> 09:19.934
It's confirmed. She's in a cult.
We need a game plan.

09:20.017 --> 09:24.397
Oh, and I just wanted to apologize
for acting odd at the restaurant.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.525
My roommates
don't know I'm practicing law again,

09:27.608 --> 09:30.403
but I assure you,
it won't affect our case.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.155
We need to tell her that we know,

09:33.239 --> 09:36.200
-and that she has to get out of it.
-We can't confront her.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.537
Like when someone has terrible bangs,
you don't tell them.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.082
They have to realize for themselves
the bangs don't work.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.544
You liked my bangs, right,
before they grew out?

09:46.627 --> 09:48.504
Oh. Mm-hm.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.757
Okay. Talk soon.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.718
Okay, she's coming. Go, go, go.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.680
Oh, hi, Solana.
I didn't realize you were home.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.225
Not for long.
I've got a big day ahead. Of healing.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.395
Why don't you do your healing
here at home, with us?

10:04.478 --> 10:09.066
I could do some of my very tranquil,
very relaxing beatboxing to set the mood.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.702
Thanks, but it's an in-home client.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.580
Okay, well, I just wanna let you know

10:22.663 --> 10:26.667
that if you need to talk
to anyone about anything, we're here.

10:26.751 --> 10:30.630
Yeah. If you're scared
or feel like you don't know where to turn,

10:30.713 --> 10:33.799
or you're nervous
for an upcoming erotic ritual,

10:33.883 --> 10:35.051
we got you, girl.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.179
I'm fine. I gotta go.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.017
Last time I heard someone say "I'm fine,"

10:43.100 --> 10:45.519
Richard was sent to visit Mother Spider.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.274
She's in deep. She needs us.
She can't be trusted on her own!

10:50.358 --> 10:51.651
We have to follow her.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.903
I still remember how to stalk people

10:53.986 --> 10:56.822
from when the Collective was
obsessed with Dianne Feinstein.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.367
Right. "Stay behind-y the Feiny."

11:04.664 --> 11:05.915
How's she doing?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.918
Walking real slow,
staring at that chunk of metal.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.253
This must be
how goats get pumped for dinner.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.048
And has she complained
about staring at the can?

11:14.131 --> 11:18.427
No. But she does
keep looking over at me like...

11:18.928 --> 11:20.763
Grant!

11:22.098 --> 11:23.557
You see? Just like that.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.184
She's not ready, Michael.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.103
Grant, please!

11:27.186 --> 11:28.187
Eye on the can.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.194
What is this place?

11:35.277 --> 11:39.949
I don't know, but the walls are so green,
I feel like I'm inside an avocado.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.120
-Someone's coming. What do we do?
-Say something cult-y.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.873
-Uh, love and blessings.
-Late '90s Madonna.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.919
Okay, she was acting crazy.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.383
Jayden, there she is,
and there's the bald guy.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.093
And they're wearing suits?

11:59.176 --> 12:02.513
It's worse than we imagined.
The fashions in particular.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.142
You entered into an agreement,
there's no negotiating it.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.602
You're asking us to do the unthinkable.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.021
There's no coming back
according to the affidavit.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.941
Affidavit?
My really German SoulCycle instructor?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.735
He's wrapped up in this too?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.322
Have you even
considered the circumstantial evidence?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.575
They're circumcising each other.

12:24.368 --> 12:28.706
Enough talking. Let's get this done
and execute the final judgment now.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.585
Oh, my God, it's happening now.
We have to save her.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.253
Applesauce.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.089
That's it! We've heard enough!

12:37.173 --> 12:41.135
We're here to save this girl.
We know she's in there. Remember her!

12:42.678 --> 12:44.054
Why are you guys here?

12:44.138 --> 12:47.141
Solana, it's Jayden,
your most famous friend.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.477
I'm here now. I'm here now.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.562
I hope someone's recording this.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.564
What is going on?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.608
You are escaping this death cult.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.485
-Cult?
-Cult?

12:57.568 --> 13:02.490
Oh, excuse me, techno-spiritual
soul-enlightening organization.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.783
I know what you're up to.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.869
You wanna change Solana,
own her and possess her,

13:06.952 --> 13:10.039
all while playing Frisbee
in the sunniest parks.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
Allison, what are they talking about?

13:12.124 --> 13:15.085
Stop calling her by her cult name.
Her real name is Solana.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.504
No, it's not!

13:18.464 --> 13:21.050
My real name is Allison.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.097
What?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.643
And I'm not in a cult.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.396
I'm practicing law again.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.109
Oh.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.031
-I see that now.
-Yeah, this feels less heroic.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.290
She's gone completely blank.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.834
Eyes all glazed over.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.795
Looks like my mom
when she watches QVC at 3 a.m.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.256
Any complaining?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.508
No. She hasn't even pointed out

14:02.591 --> 14:05.052
raspberry's misspelled
on the smoothie chalkboard.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.971
She's ready.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.061
All right, Chelsea, time to run.
Keep your eye on the can.

14:14.144 --> 14:18.107
Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.443
Now we're talking. This feels good.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.822
Whoa! Hey.
Hello! How fast are we going here?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.408
-Keep your eye on the can.
-I can't--

14:27.491 --> 14:29.034
-Eye on the can.
-I can't--

14:29.118 --> 14:32.079
Eye on the can.
Repeat after me. Eye on the can.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.123
-Eye on the can.
-Good. Again.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.082
-Eye.
-Eye.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.208
-Can.
-Can.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.002
-I can.
-I can.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.712
-I can.
-I can.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.380
I can.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.507
I can.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.134
I can.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.053
-What can you do?
-I can run fast.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.722
Yes, you can. What else?

14:49.805 --> 14:52.558
I can parallel park while someone watches.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.601
What else?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.312
Put on eyeliner without opening my mouth!

14:56.395 --> 14:57.396
What else?

14:57.479 --> 15:01.108
I can... I can finish my story.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.151
Yes, you can!

15:02.234 --> 15:06.030
Yes, I can. Yes, I can!
I can finish my story!

15:07.990 --> 15:11.201
I gotta finish my story.
You're coming with me, mister.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.915
Well, I gotta go to Hawaii.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.543
If she can leave her job
in the middle of the day, so can I.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.839
I'm sorry I lied to you guys.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.924
It's okay.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.052
I just don't understand why
you've been hiding being a lawyer.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.137
I get why you wouldn't want us to know

15:30.220 --> 15:32.473
that you hang out
with people who dress like that,

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
but otherwise, yeah, why?

15:34.725 --> 15:38.187
Being a lawyer is a part
of a really dark time in my past.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.356
You'll never speak to me again
if you knew.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.441
Solana, there's no judgment here.

15:42.524 --> 15:46.070
Jayden and I were part of a cult
that kidnapped the uncles of celebrities

15:46.153 --> 15:49.239
to raise money
to build a big retaining wall.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.953
Yeah, what happened, sweetie?
You can tell us anything.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.000
Well, I became a lawyer
to fight the big guy, right?

16:00.501 --> 16:03.879
Then I took a job at a firm
to pay my law school debt.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.383
I became their youngest partner.
Allison the Assassin.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.884
-So fun.
-I love that.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.138
I got this big corporate client
with a highly problematic case.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.643
You defended People magazine when they
named Blake Shelton the sexiest man?

16:18.852 --> 16:23.190
No. I defended Deepview Petroleum
in the Blackwater Horizon oil spill.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.027
The one that dumped oil
into the Gulf of Mexico.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.197
-Killed all those poor dolphins?
-Yes.

16:30.906 --> 16:34.034
I argued that
the dolphins were being too chatty,

16:34.118 --> 16:38.706
thus sending sonar waves into the pipes
and bursting them with their chirps.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.000
You blamed the oil spill on the dolphins?

16:42.876 --> 16:44.169
And I won.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.133
I know. You hate me, and you're right to.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.592
I'm a monster.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.303
I hated the old me too,
that's why I changed my name.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.640
Solana is just Allison
with the letters changed around.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.310
Are we sure about that?

17:03.981 --> 17:09.028
Look, whether you're Solana or Allison,
we could never hate you.

17:10.070 --> 17:14.199
And, sure, what you did back then
wasn't super cool to the dolphins,

17:14.283 --> 17:16.994
but you're obviously an amazing lawyer.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.288
Just use your superpowers for good.

17:20.330 --> 17:25.461
Yeah, on actual evil, like frackers
and people who read Cigar Aficionado.

17:28.130 --> 17:32.801
I think it's time for peaceful Solana
and hard-arguing Allison to merge together

17:32.885 --> 17:34.678
into one unstoppable...

17:34.762 --> 17:37.306
-Solallison!
-The Assassissin!

17:38.348 --> 17:39.516
Thanks, guys.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.684
-Of course.
-Yeah.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.020
Ooh. Now that you're practicing law again,

17:43.103 --> 17:47.066
I'm being sued by Wendy's for wearing
red pigtails in a nude photoshoot.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.151
Bring them on.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.863
Oh, there's my girls.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.744
Good night, Linda.
Good luck with your pot roast.

18:02.081 --> 18:02.915
Hey.

18:02.998 --> 18:07.669
Hey, Chels. What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be home writing.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.963
I'm done.

18:10.464 --> 18:14.426
I wrote.
And the words just flowed out of me.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.470
-Like a microwave.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.558
I came up with an ending
and I submitted my story.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.810
That's great.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.062
Yeah, it's amazing.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.525
Then why are you looking at me
like I'm an ages-14-and-up puzzle?

18:31.026 --> 18:34.613
I just...
I can't wrap my head around what you did.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.907
"I can." It's just...

18:36.990 --> 18:38.534
Kind of silly, I know.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.037
I didn't see it coming.
How did you know it would work?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.415
Yesterday, you said "I can't"
three different times.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.709
-Really? You noticed?
-Seven throughout the day.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.421
Fifteen, if you count today.
I'm a trainer, I'm very good at counting.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.759
I can get down on myself sometimes.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.680
The Chelsea I know
can do anything she puts her mind to.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.849
I just needed to remind her.

19:03.308 --> 19:07.938
You. I'm talking about you.
You're the "her" that I'm talking about.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.482
Yeah. I get it.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.447
Grant, I've never met anyone like you.
You're kind of brilliant.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.367
-Stop it.
-No, I'm serious.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.453
-Means a lot coming from you.
-From me? Please.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.791
Are you kidding? I feel lucky
that I even get to hang out with you.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.588
That's like the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me. God.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.506
I could just kiss you.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.391
What did I say
about making promises you can't keep?
