00:02.268 --> 00:03.135
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:06.171
- Even though matty is blind
to your treachery,

00:06.173 --> 00:07.072
I'm not.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.039
- End it with colin
or tell matty.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.375
- You need to shut
that [bleep] down.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.611
- Your mom's throwing you
a surprise party!

00:12.613 --> 00:15.047
All: Surprise!

00:23.056 --> 00:25.591
- Jenna, honey?

00:25.593 --> 00:28.927
Are you still in there?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.296
- Physically, yes.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.799
Mentally, I am
all over the place.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.769
- Are you coming out today?

00:36.771 --> 00:39.638
- No.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.340
- So you're not going to school?

00:41.342 --> 00:45.210
- How can I go to school
if I'm not coming out?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.012
- Good point.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.715
Should I tell the school
you're sick?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.650
- Tell them whatever you want.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.651
My life is over.

00:52.653 --> 00:56.789
Matty won't return my calls
or my emails or my texts.

00:56.791 --> 00:57.790
I even called his house phone

00:57.792 --> 01:00.959
And his mom picked up and said
that he wasn't available.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.094
What does that even mean?

01:02.096 --> 01:05.464
That's he's not available
for everyone or for me?

01:05.465 --> 01:06.932
I am freaking out.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.467
So just please go away.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.970
I'm never gonna recover from
everything that happened.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.806
- I'm gonna go run some errands.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.040
Are you sure
you don't wanna come with?

01:15.042 --> 01:19.311
And tell me if you and matty
are still together?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.380
- Go away.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.816
- Or you can just tell me.

01:23.818 --> 01:26.919
- Go away!

01:45.472 --> 01:47.906
- Ha!
I fooled you.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.575
Just talk to me.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.576
- I don't wanna talk.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.077
I just wanna be left alone

01:52.079 --> 01:53.045
To suffer in silence.

01:53.047 --> 01:55.781
I am an ass[bleep]
and a cheater and a liar

01:55.783 --> 01:56.849
And everyone hates me.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.283
- Did you and matty break up?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.051
Or are you still together?

01:59.053 --> 02:01.787
Just give me something
that I can work with.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.555
I need clarity.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.991
- And I need a hug.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.726
- Oh, baby.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.027
Oh!

02:10.030 --> 02:11.497
Damn it!

02:11.499 --> 02:13.932
[door closes]

02:16.236 --> 02:20.606
Honey, I know what
will make you feel better!

02:20.608 --> 02:22.407
Let's open your gifts!

02:22.409 --> 02:25.644
[loud rock music plays]

02:25.646 --> 02:27.479
â™ª

02:27.481 --> 02:33.819
If you don't come out,
I'm gonna open them for you!

02:35.722 --> 02:38.557
I'm doing it!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.564
Never mind!

02:48.568 --> 02:50.736
Jenna won't
come out of her room.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.004
She's been in there all weekend

02:52.006 --> 02:53.705
And now she's
not going to school.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.806
- So she's pulling a sick-out?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.575
- A what-out?
- A sick-out.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.476
She's being a truant.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.077
- I'm gonna write her a note.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.879
- Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.047
The less I know the better.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.416
I cannot be complicit
in your scheme.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.684
- What should I do?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.718
- Break down her door.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.121
- I thought about that,
but I just painted the hall.

03:09.123 --> 03:09.788
- Right, right.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.089
It's a little extreme.
Tear gas?

03:11.091 --> 03:14.760
- I think we've had enough tears
this weekend to last a lifetime.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.129
- Okay, let's just cut
to what's really important.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.164
Are jenna and matty
still together?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.799
- I don't know.
- Damn it!

03:20.801 --> 03:22.868
- Can you keep
your ears to the street?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.169
- That's where they live l-dog.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.371
I'll call you later
with the intel.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.339
[phone beeps]

03:27.341 --> 03:28.173
- You have to talk to jenna.

03:28.175 --> 03:31.610
- I would if I could,
but she won't return my calls

03:31.612 --> 03:32.945
Or answer any of my texts.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.012
Have you talked to matty?
- No.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.949
I haven't seen him all day or
heard from him all weekend.

03:36.951 --> 03:37.883
Not since the party.

03:37.885 --> 03:38.784
He's icing me out too.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.052
- Where's t?
- Hell if I know.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.286
She's not answering her cell.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.322
- What is going on in our world?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.590
- It's madness.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.793
It's total [bleep] madness.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.161
So, what do you think?

03:49.163 --> 03:51.196
Jenna and matty break up or not?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.965
- Isn't it obvious?

03:52.967 --> 03:53.599
It's over.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.801
- How do you know?
- How do you not know?

03:55.803 --> 03:56.568
You were there too.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.803
You saw the aftermath.
- No.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.438
After jenna and collin
came through the door,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.441
I went out back to call tamara
and give her a heads-up.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.208
Don't you remember?

04:03.210 --> 04:05.277
- Dude, I wasn't paying
attention to you.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.613
I was watching the show.
- What show?

04:07.615 --> 04:10.115
- You don't know?
- Know what?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.049
- Okay.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.752
So it was moments
before the surprise.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.454
We were crouching
behind the couch,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.288
Waiting to surprise jenna.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.757
- Oh, yeah, that's when
I asked, "where's tamara?"

04:18.759 --> 04:21.260
- And I said,
"she's on her way."

04:21.262 --> 04:22.661
- And then I rolled my eyes.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.528
- Are you gonna let me finish

04:23.530 --> 04:24.963
Or are we gonna debate
the details all day?

04:24.965 --> 04:25.831
- Okay, okay.
Continue.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.268
- So, we could hear the keys
rumbling at the door

04:29.270 --> 04:31.370
And then valerie
was getting apoplectic

04:31.372 --> 04:32.571
About shushing me up

04:32.573 --> 04:34.273
Because lissa
was going on and on

04:34.275 --> 04:35.874
About finally
getting out of her neck brace.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.077
- And my doctor, brian, he let's
me call him by his first name

04:39.079 --> 04:40.746
Because he wants me
to feel more comfortable

04:40.748 --> 04:42.748
When he examines
my breasts, so--

04:42.750 --> 04:43.815
- Do you not understand english?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.884
When I said quiet,
I meant <i>silencio!</i>

04:45.886 --> 04:48.186
If you keep talking,
you're gonna ruin the surprise,

04:48.188 --> 04:48.854
And ruining the surprise

04:48.856 --> 04:52.291
Is the worst thing
that can possibly happen.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.292
[door slams]

04:53.294 --> 04:55.827
All: Surprise!

04:55.829 --> 04:57.162
- Surprise indeed.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.497
- So I guess
ruining the surprise

04:58.499 --> 05:00.265
Is not the worst thing
that could happen.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.734
- Then collin bailed

05:02.736 --> 05:06.438
And matty went after him,
pissed.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.539
- Oh, my god.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.575
- I was trying to sneak out
and watch the action

05:10.577 --> 05:12.978
When valerie
jock-blocked the exit.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.979
- Nothing to see here!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.480
Let's just put on some music

05:15.482 --> 05:16.148
And roll out the snacks.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.350
It's a [bleep] party, people,
so let's party!

05:18.352 --> 05:23.322
- So I grabbed a seat just
in time to see the aftermath.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.656
- I'm so sorry, collin.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.757
I can't deal.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.126
- Matty hit collin,

05:28.128 --> 05:30.362
Then jenna apologized to collin,

05:30.364 --> 05:33.031
Which infers
that she's sided with him,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.900
Which further infers
the obvious fact

05:34.902 --> 05:37.703
That jenna and matty are done.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.271
- But matty didn't hit collin.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.006
- Then who did?
- Jenna.

05:41.008 --> 05:41.973
- What?

05:41.975 --> 05:42.974
How do you know?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.277
- Well, I had just tried
calling tamara, you know,

05:45.279 --> 05:46.611
To fill her in on the sitch,

05:46.613 --> 05:48.447
But she wasn't picking up.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.448
So when I came back in,

05:49.450 --> 05:52.484
Jenna was taking collin
into the kitchen.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.286
- I'm so sorry, collin.

05:54.288 --> 05:54.920
I can't deal.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.522
And then the dude
slowly turned to me,

05:57.524 --> 06:00.225
Looked me square
in the eye and said...

06:00.227 --> 06:02.160
- I didn't know a girl
could hit that hard.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.630
- Can you believe he had the
balls to turn to me for empathy?

06:05.632 --> 06:06.765
- It's infuriating.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.368
But besides the point,
what happened next?

06:09.370 --> 06:10.469
And where was I?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.269
- Well, then jenna left the room

06:11.271 --> 06:13.138
And mrs. Hamilton
took collin to the sink.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.539
- Oh, god.
Okay, come with me.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.809
- You were on the couch
eating guac and chips.

06:17.811 --> 06:18.410
- Right.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.812
My blood sugar always
gets low when I'm stressed.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.414
- And mrs. Hamilton
makes some good guac.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.516
- Please.
She don't make that.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.250
It's store-bought.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.352
- But I've seen her putting
avocados into a bowl.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.987
- With the store-bought guac.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.088
It's her trick.

06:30.090 --> 06:35.394
So what we know is jenna hit
collin to win matty back.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.429
- And then felt bad
for [bleep] up collin's face.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.898
- So she went back inside
to help fix said face, then--

06:39.900 --> 06:43.201
- Went back outside again
to find matty

06:43.203 --> 06:43.869
To beg for forgiveness.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.370
- And he's a softie,
which means...

06:45.372 --> 06:46.772
Both: They're still together!

06:46.774 --> 06:49.975
- But jenna didn't hit collin.

06:49.977 --> 06:50.675
I did.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.811
Which is why I missed school
this morning.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.512
I had to see a doctor.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.680
My hand blew up
to the size of a potato.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.082
- Everyone's hand
is the size of a potato.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.385
- No, like, a modern potato
that's jacked and stacked.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.052
On steroids.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.521
- So what happened?
- I sprained it.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.389
Both: No, with collin.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.424
- Ohhh.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.627
So I was jimmy-jammying it
to get to the party,

07:08.629 --> 07:09.728
But I had a wardrobe malfunction

07:09.730 --> 07:11.363
And had to stop
to de-cling the static

07:11.365 --> 07:12.798
That was riding
the jutt of my butt.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.566
So my timing was off
and I was late-late.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.801
And I couldn't find my phone.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.336
It wasn't in my purse
or on my person

07:18.338 --> 07:19.404
And I still can't find it.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.239
Anyway, when I got
outside the house,

07:21.241 --> 07:23.475
Jenna and collin were getting
up close and personal

07:23.477 --> 07:24.376
And I didn't know what to do.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.778
I was speechless,
which really says something.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.714
So I slid and hid,
and then before I could get

07:29.716 --> 07:32.184
Into a good squat of thought,
I heard...

07:32.186 --> 07:33.418
All: Surprise!

07:33.420 --> 07:36.588
- At that point, I knew it was
safe to make an appearance.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.856
But as I popped out
of the bushes,

07:37.858 --> 07:40.892
Collin then matty then jenna
rolled out of the house.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.595
As the boys ran down the steps,
jenna yelled...

07:43.597 --> 07:44.329
- Wait!

07:44.331 --> 07:45.030
- And it was so sad

07:45.032 --> 07:47.699
Because they both turned, not
knowing who she was talking to.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.167
- It didn't mean anything.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.101
It was a mistake.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.503
- She was talking to matty.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.704
And matty--poor matty.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.639
He looked like he had been
stun gunned to the heart,

07:54.641 --> 07:57.242
So he was, like, paralyzed,
not saying anything.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.411
So I did what any
decent friend would do.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.745
I gave him a nudge.

08:00.747 --> 08:04.249
Hit him!

08:04.251 --> 08:06.952
- What's the point?

08:06.954 --> 08:07.686
- Fine.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.221
If you won't, I will.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.689
- Ow!

08:10.691 --> 08:11.957
[bleep]!

08:11.959 --> 08:12.757
You broke my nose.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.392
- And you broke my bf/gf/bff!

08:14.394 --> 08:17.195
Do you even realize how many
years of praying it took

08:17.197 --> 08:18.597
To make that dream a reality?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.966
You ruined my life!
Ow.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.001
Can you believe that douchebag?

08:23.003 --> 08:23.902
- I can't believe you hit him.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.471
- It was an impulsive reaction
to an emotional situation

08:26.473 --> 08:29.508
And I swear, I will never
pissed-fist again, ever.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.009
Please don't be disappointed.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.078
- I'm not disappointed.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.011
I'm impressed.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.280
You did some real damage.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.114
Up top, babe.

08:36.116 --> 08:40.217
I love you.
- I love you.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.722
- [clears throat]

08:44.824 --> 08:46.558
So they're over?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.760
- Finished.
- Done-zo washington.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.861
- Who are you talking about?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.962
All: Jenna and matty.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.565
- They're not done.

08:57.937 --> 08:58.737
- How are they not done?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.938
- I don't know the ins and outs.

08:59.940 --> 09:00.872
I just know what I know.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.706
And here's what I know.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.342
I was crouched down
next to ming for the surprise,

09:04.344 --> 09:06.511
Which was tricky,
because I'm not a small person.

09:06.513 --> 09:10.815
Suddenly, jenna and collin came
through the door, tongue tied

09:10.817 --> 09:14.452
And we yelled:
All: Surprise!

09:14.454 --> 09:15.554
- Were were there, we know.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.122
Get to the pertinent info.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.891
- Okay, okay.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.493
So the scene became chaotic.

09:21.495 --> 09:25.130
Complete, disorganized mayhem,
and mayhem isn't my middle name.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.898
It's chen.
- Oh!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.301
- Therefore, I was
extremely uncomfortable.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.201
- Nothing to see here.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.336
Let's just put on some music--

09:31.338 --> 09:33.471
- All I wanted was
to grab a snack and go.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.274
But I got sandbagged
by ms. Marks.

09:36.276 --> 09:36.808
- You.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.009
You're tall and good at math.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.144
I need your expertise.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.111
Come with me.

09:40.113 --> 09:40.946
This is the ticket.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.148
Nothing gets a party
back on track

09:43.150 --> 09:44.015
Like la pinata.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.618
And I jam packed that bad boy
with so many goodies

09:46.620 --> 09:48.853
That we will be blowing away
our problems

09:48.855 --> 09:51.957
Along with little
bottles of bubbles.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.925
- I think that
may be the problem.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.360
The pinata's too heavy.

09:55.362 --> 09:59.130
- Put your back into it, junior.
Your people built the railroads.

09:59.132 --> 09:59.531
Come on.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.366
- Is that why she asked
if you're good at math?

10:01.368 --> 10:02.634
- Possibly.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.069
Or she's racist.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.770
- Ooh, who's a racist?

10:05.772 --> 10:06.471
All: Valerie.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.373
- Tell me something
I don't know.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.574
- I'm about to.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.376
Anyway, I finally figured out

10:11.378 --> 10:13.378
How to rig the pinata
based on an algorithm

10:13.380 --> 10:15.780
Of height plus weight
minus ignorance.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.751
When suddenly, out of a play
in my own handbook,

10:19.753 --> 10:20.452
Matty hopped the fence

10:20.454 --> 10:21.920
And headed to a back entrance
of the house.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.155
All: Jenna's backdoor!
- Sure.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.292
- Did he or didn't he
go inside?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.528
- I don't know where he went
or the layout of the house.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.365
I've only been privy to
the living room and backyard.

10:33.367 --> 10:38.637
- After he hopped the fence,
did matty go right or left?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.306
- It was the left.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.907
- That's the side yard.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.376
There's no entrance.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.477
- Maybe it was the right.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.678
I'm getting flustered.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.447
Let me think.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.249
It was the right.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.717
Definitely the right.

10:52.719 --> 10:53.385
I think.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.587
- How do you not know
your right from your left?

10:55.589 --> 10:56.287
- This is important!

10:56.289 --> 10:57.989
- I'm--I'm not good
under pressure,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.157
And I'm moderately dyslexic!

10:59.159 --> 11:02.060
- That's okay.
Take a breath.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.328
So from what we can gather,

11:03.330 --> 11:06.264
Matty went to jenna's backdoor
to make up.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.432
- Or tear into her.
- Nope.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.133
You're both wrong.

11:08.135 --> 11:12.771
Apparently I'm the only backdoor
authority at this table.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.574
You see, I had gotten to the
party just in the nick of time.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.878
And while everyone was
scrambling for a hiding spot,

11:19.880 --> 11:20.879
Nature called.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.682
I need to find the little boys'
room and fast.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.317
But the powder room
was too close to the action

11:26.319 --> 11:29.821
And I don't like
to broadcast my stream.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.258
[toilet flushes]
upon finishing my business,

11:33.260 --> 11:35.894
I heard:
All: Surprise!

11:35.896 --> 11:36.761
- I had missed the spectacle,

11:36.763 --> 11:39.764
So I decided to take my time
and lather up on lotion.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.434
Managing our skin care
is essential at our age.

11:42.436 --> 11:46.738
Not to mention, the lotion
was jasmine scented.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.206
I love me some tropical flowers.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.642
Reminds me of this time
I was time-sharing in tulum

11:50.644 --> 11:51.743
And the family
was gathered around.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.845
We were all laying out
on the beach, tanning--

11:53.847 --> 11:54.879
All: Get to it!

11:54.881 --> 11:56.047
- Jeez, settle down.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.483
I'm just trying to paint
a pretty picture.

11:58.485 --> 12:02.253
So, I left the bathroom
and lo and behold,

12:02.255 --> 12:05.223
There was jenna
on her bed, crying.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.224
Oh, no.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.759
Did the surprise scare you?

12:07.761 --> 12:09.360
Jenna didn't answer.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.262
She just cried harder.
- [sobs]

12:11.264 --> 12:14.566
- And that's
when matty barged in.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.700
All: And then what?

12:15.702 --> 12:16.367
- He started pacing.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.737
- 'cause he was trying
to figure out what to say.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.105
- Or fight off the tears.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.706
- Or get a little exercise.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.541
- Stop interjecting!

12:23.543 --> 12:25.610
Clark, finish, please.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.778
- Thank you, sweetie.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.749
So, matty continued
pacing back and forth

12:30.751 --> 12:32.751
Looking around the room
and jenna pleaded:

12:32.753 --> 12:34.319
- Matty, please, I can explain.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.653
- Oh, you don't
need to say anything.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.489
I think that kiss said it all.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.823
- Would you please
just look at me?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.225
- But he wouldn't look at her.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.193
He just kept pacing
around the room.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.495
And then--
all: And then?

12:43.497 --> 12:45.330
- He found
his car keys and left.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.999
- That doesn't mean anything.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.101
- Or maybe it does.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.503
Maybe he left to calm down

12:51.505 --> 12:54.405
And jenna texted collin
to tell him to leave,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.608
And maybe that's why
collin got upset

12:56.610 --> 12:58.576
And started the fire
in the kitchen.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.011
- There was a fire?

13:00.013 --> 13:01.312
- Oh, right.
The fire.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.549
We were eating chips and guac--
- made at gelson's.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.584
- When something
started to smell.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.052
Is something burning?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.721
- Um...
[sniffs]

13:09.723 --> 13:11.189
Yeah.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.392
[smoke detector beeps]

13:14.394 --> 13:16.661
- Fire!

13:17.930 --> 13:21.166
- Lacey, what are you thinking

13:21.168 --> 13:22.901
Cooking pre-cooked cupcakes?

13:22.903 --> 13:25.937
- Told ya, mrs. Hamilton
doesn't cook.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.071
She collaborates.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.106
- Well, what about the stir-fry

13:28.108 --> 13:29.307
She made for me last year
on my birthday?

13:29.309 --> 13:34.479
- That wasn't stir-fry.
It was stir-lie, my friend.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.380
- And that's it?

13:35.382 --> 13:36.581
That's all we know?

13:36.583 --> 13:37.382
- Actually, no.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.984
After the fire was out,
we heard a scream.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.587
- And we ran outside
to console jenna.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.055
- But that wasn't jenna.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.524
- Why did you scream?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.726
- Well...

13:48.894 --> 13:51.296
It started when I was
waiting for the surprise

13:51.298 --> 13:53.565
And I got the great idea
to film it.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.334
I mean, who wouldn't wanna
see their own surprise

13:56.336 --> 13:57.435
After being surprised?

13:57.437 --> 13:58.803
But my phone was in my purse

13:58.805 --> 13:59.904
That was under a couple of bags

13:59.906 --> 14:01.906
Around the other side
of ming and fred.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.975
But thankfully,
I had full mobility again

14:03.977 --> 14:07.312
And I could reach around
with full range of commotion.

14:07.314 --> 14:07.846
All: Motion.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.113
- And then the door
started to turn

14:09.115 --> 14:10.014
And valerie got in my face

14:10.016 --> 14:12.650
And next thing you know,
I was up on my feet.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.452
All: Surprise.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.453
I mean, I sprung up real fast

14:15.455 --> 14:19.023
'cause I'm almost as flexible
as I was before the accident.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.025
All: Skip ahead!

14:21.027 --> 14:24.762
- So then, jenna and collin
came back inside

14:24.764 --> 14:26.764
And I started eating
and texting--

14:26.766 --> 14:28.600
All: Skip ahead!
- To where?

14:28.602 --> 14:31.002
All: The scream!
- Oh.

14:31.004 --> 14:31.569
Okay.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.538
[smoke detector beeps]
so there was a fire.

14:33.540 --> 14:33.972
Fire!

14:33.974 --> 14:35.773
And I hate fires,
so I ran outside,

14:35.775 --> 14:37.308
But I didn't know
which way to run.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.677
First I ran one way
and into matty,

14:39.679 --> 14:41.012
Who was hopping the fence.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.081
Then I ran the other way and--

14:43.083 --> 14:45.483
[screams]

14:45.485 --> 14:49.687
Got hit in the head.
- Are you okay?

14:50.422 --> 14:52.891
- I'm okay.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.198
Now I'm not.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.001
[all gasp]

15:03.003 --> 15:04.736
- Ah, nailed it!

15:04.738 --> 15:06.437
- Now I'm confused.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.539
Matty left and hopped the fence,

15:08.541 --> 15:11.743
But...Did they break up?

15:11.745 --> 15:14.812
- Do you want me to guess?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.915
All: No.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.250
- Where did matty go?

15:19.252 --> 15:22.153
- My house.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.590
- What happened at your house?

15:25.592 --> 15:26.591
- A celebration of sorts.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.460
While I wasn't invited
to jenna's party,

15:29.462 --> 15:30.361
I was there.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.730
Virtually speaking.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.499
All: Surprise!

15:34.501 --> 15:39.771
- Oh, hamiltoe, how you never
cease to disappoint.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.140
[knocks on door]

15:44.476 --> 15:45.877
Matty was apathetic.

15:45.879 --> 15:50.181
That bitch was dead to him
on arrival.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.718
- How could she do this to me?

16:04.930 --> 16:10.034
- I gotta say, I was surprised
he was so callous.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.537
- He dumped her?

16:12.539 --> 16:15.239
- I cannot confirm
nor deny that statement.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.409
- What does that mean?
- It means she's useless.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.246
- And you're a troll.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.717
You're welcome.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.019
- This is pointless.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.654
Can we talk
about something else?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.154
- Please.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.190
- Nussbaum liquor
doesn't card anymore.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.791
All: Really?

16:33.793 --> 16:39.364
[chattering, laughter]

16:39.366 --> 16:42.133
- L-dog, I got nada.
No intel.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.401
No one's talking about it.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.435
- Thanks for trying.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.771
I guess we won't know
till we know.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.108
- Is the fox still in the hole?
- She's in her room.

16:50.110 --> 16:54.245
And there's no telling
if she'll ever come out.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.347
Gotta go.
[phone beeps]

16:56.349 --> 16:57.749
Honey, you okay?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.117
Where are you going?

16:59.119 --> 17:00.685
- To talk to matty.

17:00.687 --> 17:05.490
- To...Break up?
Make up?

17:05.492 --> 17:07.657
- I don't know.

17:39.358 --> 17:43.094
- I don't know what to say.

17:44.696 --> 17:48.266
How long has it been going on?

17:48.268 --> 17:50.568
- A day.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.704
A few days.
Not long.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.007
- What did you do with him?

17:56.009 --> 17:57.275
Actually don't--don't tell me.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.877
I don't wanna know.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.513
Just tell me
that I won't ever have to know.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.216
- Okay.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.851
But it meant nothing.

18:06.853 --> 18:11.856
- Okay, I-I can
forgive you, jenna.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.326
It's just--it's gonna
take me some time.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.627
- I understand.

18:16.629 --> 18:23.301
- So, well, uh, let's try
to get back to where we were?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.807
- We can't.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.910
- What do you mean?

18:32.912 --> 18:38.983
- I mean,
I can't--I can't go back.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.021
- Are you breaking up with me?

18:44.023 --> 18:45.356
- No.

18:45.824 --> 18:50.261
We're breaking up with
each other because...

18:50.263 --> 18:52.897
This must have happened
for a reason,

18:52.899 --> 18:54.866
And I can't look at you

18:54.868 --> 18:57.535
And wonder if
when you look at me

18:57.537 --> 19:00.004
You see the same girl
you fell in love with

19:00.006 --> 19:02.907
Before this happened.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.979
I'm so, so sorry, matty.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.482
I'm so sorry.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.220
- â™ª I need you back

19:16.222 --> 19:19.790
â™ª are you comin' back â™ª

19:19.792 --> 19:22.493
- [sniffles]

19:22.495 --> 19:27.832
- â™ª I'm waiting â™ª

19:27.834 --> 19:34.672
â™ª I'm waiting â™ª

19:36.575 --> 19:37.308
- Next on <i>awkward...</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:39.010
A barbecue is the perfect way
to ease the weirdness.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.144
- Who's coming?
- Everybody.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.879
- Everybody except matty.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.381
- I'll go to the damn barbecue.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.148
I seriously don't care.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.816
- I don't want them
feeling pressured

19:45.818 --> 19:46.617
To take sides.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
- No one is taking sides.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.320
- Where are all the hotties?

19:49.322 --> 19:50.621
- Ming texted.
They're running late.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.658
- How late?
[phone tone]

19:53.660 --> 19:55.226
- Late.
