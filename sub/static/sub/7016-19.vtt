WEBVTT

00:03.981 --> 00:05.087
Wow that was great.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.947
I'm glad we stretched beforehand.

00:09.179 --> 00:12.071
And I have to say, I was terrific.

00:14.039 --> 00:17.374
You know, I've never said this
before Tracy, but...

00:17.374 --> 00:19.483
you're the best lover I ever had.

00:25.198 --> 00:27.493
You know I have never said this
before Nicole, but...

00:28.648 --> 00:30.859
you're the best lover I ever had.

00:37.184 --> 00:39.229
I never said this before Susan...

00:39.699 --> 00:41.359
you're the best lover I ever had.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.555
My name is Lucy.

00:46.055 --> 00:48.542
The one time people understand me
I get the name wrong.

00:54.978 --> 01:00.071
Jackie, I'd offer you a third sandwhich but
you've cleaned me out of meat and condiments.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.283
And cheese-whiz.

01:04.495 --> 01:07.611
Well now we're gonna have to use
the artificial stuff.

01:09.931 --> 01:11.198
I don't know what's wrong
with me okay ?

01:11.198 --> 01:14.074
I want a guy I can't have,
I can't stop stuffing my face.

01:14.698 --> 01:17.215
I am a thin girl with fat girl problems.

01:18.166 --> 01:18.900
Alright.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.156
If Fez and Jackie get together,
it's official...

01:21.478 --> 01:23.542
She becomes Point Place
sluttiest slut.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.495
Well I think it's nice you wanna be
with Fez.

01:28.721 --> 01:30.748
He has turned into a fine young man.

01:31.073 --> 01:33.823
And you never know with foreigners,
they can go either way.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.621
Come on Jackie, I know what'll
cheer you up.

01:42.088 --> 01:45.590
Let's go down to the mall and make fun
of all the people coming out of the Big&Tall store.

01:47.670 --> 01:51.484
Donna, if you need something from
the Big&Tall, just say so...

01:53.825 --> 01:54.782
Well Kitty...

01:55.825 --> 01:58.449
...cardiologist said I don't have to take
my heart pills anymore.

01:59.034 --> 02:00.826
Well that is wonderful news.

02:01.418 --> 02:02.972
Oh and you know what this means ?

02:03.575 --> 02:06.048
We can bring back fried cheese friday !

02:07.140 --> 02:08.638
It's not good news Kitty.

02:09.013 --> 02:11.810
I just bought a four month supply
of heart pills I don't need now.

02:12.223 --> 02:14.637
That's 200 bucks down the crapper.

02:16.158 --> 02:17.544
Why don't you just sell 'em ?

02:19.670 --> 02:24.423
You know, there's a seedy subculture
that buys drugs for recreation...

02:27.513 --> 02:31.126
I saw one time on an after school special...

02:33.546 --> 02:38.847
Well you can't sell drugs, it's illegal.
And it should be, because people
shouldn't have easy access to...

02:39.186 --> 02:42.125
...addictive substances that dull
their senses.

02:44.037 --> 02:45.827
I will be in the bath.

02:48.923 --> 02:51.203
You know man, you can sell
those pills.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.826
No I can't.

02:52.826 --> 02:55.060
Yes you can, you just have to find
the right market.

02:55.297 --> 02:57.562
Well who the hell is gonna want
a bunch of heart pills ?

03:00.736 --> 03:02.680
Anybody here take procardiacs ?

03:04.609 --> 03:06.723
The doctor is in !

03:11.790 --> 03:14.666

03:48.665 --> 03:51.345
It is torture knowing Fez is with all
these different women.

03:51.807 --> 03:55.230
All I hear from his bedroom is
"Oh Fez, you're so hot"...

03:55.697 --> 03:57.906
And then he comes out of his room
and goes off to his date.

04:00.168 --> 04:03.197
Yeah. If the walls of Fez' bedroom
could talk.

04:04.014 --> 04:06.838
Well, we probably wouldn't be able
to understand them either.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.642
You know if the walls in Fez' bedroom
could talk they'd yell...

04:11.033 --> 04:13.293
"quit humping your Victorica Principal
poster" !

04:15.941 --> 04:17.918
Oh.
Hey Fez...

04:18.952 --> 04:20.481
Where's your skank of the day ?

04:21.997 --> 04:23.502
I worked a double yesterday.

04:25.215 --> 04:26.589
So I'm taking the day off.

04:27.752 --> 04:30.620
In fact, I'm taking a break from
the ladies altogether.

04:31.122 --> 04:32.410
I knew it, he's gay !

04:34.294 --> 04:36.404
I just won 20 bucks from Mrs. Forman !

04:38.106 --> 04:42.605
No, I'm done sewing my wild oates.
Mostly because my oates can't take it anymore.

04:43.949 --> 04:47.128
These tight jeans make my ass look
great, but you pay the price up front.

04:48.857 --> 04:51.796
So wait Fez uhm, what,
no more one night stands ?

04:52.418 --> 04:55.783
Nope. I just didn't find those meaningless
flings satisfying.

04:56.544 --> 04:58.514
I think I might be a one woman guy.

04:58.748 --> 05:01.639
Do you hear that Jackie ?
Fez is a one woman guy...

05:02.565 --> 05:04.575
Yeah.
Surprising, but true.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.969
Now if you'll excuse me, these jeans
are splitting me in half.

05:12.192 --> 05:14.394
Congratulations Jackie, he's all yours !

05:15.153 --> 05:16.637
It's like you won the lottery.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.735
Oh you know, a really crappy lottery.

05:23.559 --> 05:26.651
Pretty cool huh...
50 bucks for 15 minutes work.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.288
That was on a slow day.

05:29.383 --> 05:32.134
Imagine what we could make if we
set up shop on Betty Grable movie night.

05:33.635 --> 05:38.368
Steven, we're not setting up shop anywhere.
All I want to do is get my money back.

05:38.901 --> 05:40.977
Just like after I bought Eric
that baseball mitt.

05:42.445 --> 05:44.542
Dumbass used it as a hat.

05:46.196 --> 05:48.158
Fine. We'll just get your money back.

05:48.967 --> 05:50.571
Now, where is the rest of the stash ?

05:51.495 --> 05:55.774
It's in the medicine cabinet and don't
start calling the heart medicine the stash !

05:57.010 --> 05:58.541
It makes it sound like we...

06:06.636 --> 06:07.852
What's going on ?

06:08.995 --> 06:12.025
Oh. Just...
having a little man-to-man talk.

06:13.822 --> 06:15.103
About what ?

06:16.415 --> 06:17.468
Well uh...

06:18.197 --> 06:20.637
Steven's getting a little older and
he just had some...

06:21.198 --> 06:22.119
questions...

06:26.154 --> 06:29.314
Oh please.
He was married to a stripper.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.026
If anything, he should be giving you
advice.

06:36.199 --> 06:37.338
See what you made me do ?!

06:37.860 --> 06:40.157
Now I'm lying to Kitty about
selling drugs.

06:41.854 --> 06:46.604
That's it I'm throwing those pills away.
I can't spend my retirement as a lying...

06:47.278 --> 06:48.255
...dope peddler.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.194
No man, you're not a dope peddler.

06:51.442 --> 06:52.966
You are champion of the people !

06:54.475 --> 06:58.084
Now, where does Kitty keep
those little plastic baggies ?

07:04.880 --> 07:09.224
So Fez, I hear you've been with
a different woman every night.

07:12.754 --> 07:15.257
I just hope you're doing
the gentlemanly thing.

07:15.257 --> 07:17.589
"Thank you" cards never go out of style.

07:19.037 --> 07:21.758
Actually Miss Kitty, I'm hanging out
my leather pants.

07:23.037 --> 07:26.021
Yes. I'm ready to be with the one woman...

07:26.287 --> 07:27.946
...I should've been with all along.

07:28.616 --> 07:33.570
Fez I told you a thousand times,
Mr. Forman and I are very happy together.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.977
I'm just kidding !

07:41.653 --> 07:43.695
So, is this woman someone I know ?

07:44.022 --> 07:44.946
Yes !

07:50.655 --> 07:53.070
And I know for a fact that she likes me...

07:54.655 --> 08:01.435
Oh... Oooohhh...
Fez I am so happy for you !

08:01.843 --> 08:06.071
New love is exciting, I remember the
first time I tried Peppermint Schnapps.

08:09.726 --> 08:12.198
But I want to be the one to tell her
so uhm...

08:12.607 --> 08:14.821
...so please don't tell anyone that
we had this conversation.

08:15.087 --> 08:16.679
I already forgot about it !

08:18.056 --> 08:18.883
What ?!

08:22.008 --> 08:23.573
We just had it, pay attention !

08:25.415 --> 08:28.135
No Fez, I can keep a secret.

08:28.822 --> 08:29.962
For instance...

08:30.760 --> 08:38.073
...I never told anyone that I once caught
Red wearing my nightgown to keep
his legs warm.

08:44.634 --> 08:47.636
Oh, oh you didn't hear that !

08:49.045 --> 08:51.572
Yes I did, I was right here !

08:52.385 --> 08:55.634
No I'm just saying, your secret's
safe with me.

08:59.385 --> 09:01.220
Oh hey Mrs. Forman.
What’s up ?

09:01.658 --> 09:04.057
Fez is crazy about you !

09:05.657 --> 09:07.750
Wai- What ? Really ?!

09:07.750 --> 09:09.607
Yeah ! Now I wasn’t supposed
to say anything...

09:09.847 --> 09:12.841
...but I hate when they drag things
out on soap opera’s.

09:13.184 --> 09:17.700
Nothing happens Monday through Thursday,
we all know Marlena’s the killer !

09:25.653 --> 09:28.828
Let’s just sell these things
and go home.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.848
I don’t wanna be known as the pill-guy !

09:34.186 --> 09:37.988
- Relax, you’re not the pill-guy.
- Hey ! It’s the pill-guy !

09:38.974 --> 09:40.486
Smitty, keep it down !

09:41.504 --> 09:43.950
Red, can you get me any diet-pills ?

09:44.498 --> 09:46.951
My wife’s having trouble getting
into the house.

09:47.312 --> 09:48.701
Through the garage !

09:50.140 --> 09:53.671
You think your wife is big ? My wife
just took a job at the movie theatre.

09:54.015 --> 09:55.224
As the screen !

09:56.861 --> 09:59.624
Hey guys. You come here to tell jokes
or do business ?

10:00.176 --> 10:03.914
The way I see it, you guys got
a condition, we got the product.

10:04.515 --> 10:06.674
So quit yankin’ my crank and let’s
do this, huh ?

10:07.579 --> 10:11.016
So is there someplace that we can
talk a little more private ?

10:11.268 --> 10:14.062
Certainly. Step into my office…

10:18.099 --> 10:20.626
Okay, this is what I’ve been thinking.

10:21.283 --> 10:24.893
You give us the rest of the pills and
we give you two cases of beer.

10:25.515 --> 10:30.928
Plus a couple of passes to our Friday-night
bingo marathon and Medicare seminar.

10:32.990 --> 10:35.394
What kind of deal is that ?!

10:36.673 --> 10:41.040
I come down here, sit in the sauna with
you half-naked and this is what you offer me ?!

10:42.439 --> 10:44.268
Come on Red, let’s hit the nursing homes.

10:45.438 --> 10:49.006
Whow, whow, settle down kid, we’re
all friends here, let’s work something out...

10:49.382 --> 10:53.377
...before we say things we don’t mean.
And someone winds up dead.

10:57.913 --> 11:00.518
I’m just kidding, let’s order a pizza.

11:01.532 --> 11:04.583
I just wanna get this over with.
So Steven, shut up.

11:04.975 --> 11:07.133
Cal, I’m gonna sell you those pills
at cost.

11:07.479 --> 11:10.681
And Smitty for the last time,
close your damn legs.

11:12.144 --> 11:14.362
I can’t believe Fez likes me !

11:14.790 --> 11:18.536
I mean you guys, this is everything
I ever dreamed of.

11:18.536 --> 11:22.366
Having said that I’m really glad that
my racist father isn’t here to see us together.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.738
Oh good. You’re all here.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.229
I have some big news to tell you.

11:30.846 --> 11:33.167
Unless it’s that you’re gay,
I don’t wanna hear it.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.208
Shut up, Bjorn Borg !

11:38.660 --> 11:40.509
Well Fez, what is it ?

11:41.605 --> 11:44.352
Well I finally figure out the one
woman for me.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.833
As a matter of fact…

11:47.471 --> 11:48.739
she is here right now.

11:49.116 --> 11:52.067
- Oh my Gooood…
- Hi guys !

11:53.709 --> 11:54.730
Caroline !

11:55.285 --> 11:58.241
Caroline ! I haven’t seen you since
you tried to kill us…

12:00.196 --> 12:04.230
I just couldn’t believe it when Fez called.
It was so nice to hear a familiar voice.

12:04.948 --> 12:07.537
Oh you mean coming from
outside you head ?

12:08.331 --> 12:10.021
Okayyy… the old me would’ve...

12:10.021 --> 12:13.310
...ripped out your eyeballs and hung
them from my rear-view mirror like dice.

12:13.662 --> 12:16.573
But the new me just smiles and
slaps the anger away !

12:22.147 --> 12:23.858
How sexy is that ?!

12:32.243 --> 12:34.949
Uh Fez, you said you were
a one woman guy.

12:35.357 --> 12:37.419
Caroline’s got like eight personalities.

12:39.537 --> 12:42.085
You’ll go to bed with her one night
and wake up the next morning...

12:42.085 --> 12:45.197
with like an 82-year old Portugese
fisherman.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.230
Hey, Caroline accepts me for
who I am.

12:48.991 --> 12:50.743
So I’m gonna accept her for
who they are.

12:52.460 --> 12:56.178
Fez, the last time you dated Caroline
she chased you around the room
with a corkscrew.

12:57.199 --> 12:59.069
It’s called foreplay, jerk.

13:00.162 --> 13:02.523
Yeah nothing spices up the bedroom
like a crazy woman...

13:02.742 --> 13:05.087
...who might suffocate you when
you’re asleep with a pillow.

13:06.336 --> 13:07.870
Donna we were role-playing !

13:09.663 --> 13:12.374
She was a sexy nurse and I was
the guy she was trying to kill.

13:15.649 --> 13:17.573
Red, do you need anything
from the super market ?

13:17.952 --> 13:18.795
Yeah.

13:19.994 --> 13:22.610
Graham Crackers that don’t taste
like cardboard.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.608
I fought in two wars, I deserve
name-brand cookies.

13:29.151 --> 13:30.996
Well those are name-brand !

13:31.883 --> 13:34.795
Look at the box, there is the
Kubler Dwarves.

13:38.338 --> 13:42.574
I can’t believe we’re out of plastic baggies
already. I swear I just bought a box.

13:45.151 --> 13:46.837
Well…maybe you misplaced them…

13:47.949 --> 13:50.712
You know, you’re always losing things.

13:52.267 --> 13:56.076
Like aluminum foil, remember that time
you lost the aluminum foil ?

13:57.109 --> 13:58.486
I sure do !

14:03.874 --> 14:06.823
Hello ? Hello ?

14:08.025 --> 14:10.276
Is anybody there ?!

14:12.965 --> 14:14.621
That’s the third hang-up today !

14:15.686 --> 14:19.450
Oh and this afternoon someone called
and asked me if I had “the stuff”….

14:23.808 --> 14:24.811
Wait a second…

14:25.771 --> 14:28.338
I saw a sixty minute piece on this
the other day.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.652
Missing baggies, mysterious phone calls…
I know what’s going on !

14:33.935 --> 14:34.765
Kitty I can explain…

14:34.865 --> 14:36.655
Steven is selling drugs !

14:36.855 --> 14:38.143
Yes he is !

14:49.030 --> 14:51.592
Wow. She’s really putting away
that pizza…

14:53.639 --> 14:56.184
The last time I saw her this upset
was when Reverend Brown...

14:56.184 --> 14:58.450
...told her that ugly people
go to heaven too.

15:00.341 --> 15:02.590
Sooo Jackie, can I get a slice of that ?

15:02.590 --> 15:03.997
No !

15:05.247 --> 15:07.550
Okay. I was only asking because
it’s mine !

15:10.216 --> 15:14.927
- Jackie, look. Fez and Caroline are
never gonna last. - Hi guys !

15:17.718 --> 15:19.514
Well that was just bad timing…

15:21.279 --> 15:23.029
Why are you wearing a wedding dress ?

15:24.280 --> 15:27.921
Oh my God, did Fez propose to you ?!

15:28.500 --> 15:30.342
Not yet ! But he will !

15:31.967 --> 15:33.655
And I wanted to show him
what I look like.

15:34.515 --> 15:36.185
Oh but you know, I was hoping
he’d be here cause...

15:36.185 --> 15:39.711
...I gotta get this back to the store before
they realize I climbed out the dressing room window.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.030
Don’t worry… I’m sure they’ll just
knock of ten percent..

15:44.343 --> 15:47.968
and put it on the rack marked “Previously
worn by psycho’s”.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.690
You have a sharp tongue.
It would taste great in a salad.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.157
I can’t believe Fez chose that
whack-job over me !

16:00.875 --> 16:03.531
Jackie, the only reason Fez chose
Caroline over you is because...

16:03.531 --> 16:05.240
...he doesn’t have any idea that
you like him.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.941
- Well whose fault is that Donna ?!
- Yours !

16:10.220 --> 16:13.205
Oh, thank you for kicking me
while I’m down !

16:16.628 --> 16:17.846
You know, Jackie...

16:18.710 --> 16:22.595
if you worked as hard at getting Fez
as you are at polishing off my pizza...

16:23.282 --> 16:26.095
...you'd be pushing a little bilingual
baby through the park right now.

16:32.752 --> 16:33.923
Steven how could you ?!

16:34.302 --> 16:35.960
Just a product of my environment.

16:37.359 --> 16:39.161
Wait, what are you talking about ?

16:40.253 --> 16:43.774
We know you’ve been selling drugs out
of the house, this is the worst thing
you have ever done.

16:43.774 --> 16:46.784
You have turned my living room
into East St. Louis !

16:49.236 --> 16:53.501
So please, just admit what you’re
doing it’ll be better for everybody.

16:55.189 --> 16:56.754
I'm not admitting anything.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.689
Although if I were selling drugs,
it's...

17:01.054 --> 17:04.974
probably because I don't have a new
19-inch TV to keep me off the streets.

17:06.147 --> 17:10.565
What ? Steven, we do not reward this
kind of behavior. Right, Red ?

17:11.209 --> 17:12.627
Right...

17:13.863 --> 17:17.268
A 13-inch TV should do the trick...

17:18.086 --> 17:20.097
Why are you even discussing this ?

17:20.532 --> 17:26.598
If ever there were a time for your foot to
be ankle-deep in someone's bottom, it's now !

17:32.880 --> 17:35.878
Red, those pills sold like hotcakes !

17:37.224 --> 17:39.207
We came by to give you your cut.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.419
This is not a good time guys !

17:41.419 --> 17:44.801
Red Forman, have you been selling
your heart medication ?!

17:45.003 --> 17:45.839
Yeah !

17:45.839 --> 17:47.713
They’ve done wonders for me
in the bedroom.

17:48.213 --> 17:50.337
I’m asleep before my wife comes in.

17:51.631 --> 17:52.848
I can’t believe this.

17:53.488 --> 17:55.820
I can take care of your problem
here Red…

17:56.425 --> 17:58.038
...no questions asked…

18:00.680 --> 18:03.911
I’m kidding. We should all have
dinner sometimes.

18:05.553 --> 18:07.680
Yeah well, thanks for coming by guys…

18:08.880 --> 18:09.651
Red…

18:10.476 --> 18:12.692
Look, I know what I did was wrong.

18:13.101 --> 18:15.662
But don’t you even want to know
what I was gonna do with the money ?

18:15.662 --> 18:16.528
I don’t care.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.677
I was gonna take you on a vacation
to the Wisconsin dells.

18:19.912 --> 18:22.991
Oh my God !
I feel like a Kennedy !

18:24.882 --> 18:27.257
Ohhh, and the dells are three
counties away.

18:27.602 --> 18:29.570
We’re gonna have to take the interstate !

18:34.037 --> 18:35.505
Well that worked out pretty good…

18:35.865 --> 18:37.008
You're going to the dells...

18:37.008 --> 18:38.944
I’m getting a new TV...

18:39.599 --> 18:42.696
Yeah. And you’re gonna love watching
that new show called...

18:42.943 --> 18:44.912
“Blow it out your ass”...

18:51.468 --> 18:53.195
Hey uh Fez, we need to talk.

18:53.545 --> 18:54.872
Okay fine.

18:56.563 --> 19:00.291
I used your deodorant because I wanted
to see if it was strong enough for a man.

19:02.116 --> 19:03.719
By the way, it wasn't.

19:05.509 --> 19:07.469
Uhm Fez you see...

19:08.399 --> 19:10.601
...when I heard you were ready
to be with one woman...

19:11.445 --> 19:13.117
...I got really excited.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.320
But that's because I thought you were
talking about someone else.

19:19.071 --> 19:19.946
Who ?

19:24.197 --> 19:25.852
Fez ?!

19:28.436 --> 19:30.121
Uhm, I can explain !

19:31.010 --> 19:32.058
Go ahead.

19:32.384 --> 19:34.870
Uhm, her tongue was in my mouth
and then you walked in.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.227
You...cheating...bastard....

19:42.414 --> 19:44.149
Why do you make me do this
to you ?!

19:47.623 --> 19:49.071
Not in the face !

19:49.384 --> 19:51.793
Owww okay the face !
The face !

19:57.261 --> 19:59.730
- How are you feeling ?
- Not so good.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.776
My face is freezing.

20:05.408 --> 20:08.871
I'm really sorry this happened, but
you're actually lucky that she's gone.

20:10.604 --> 20:12.370
Jackie, what was that kiss all about ?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.216
Fez it's something that I wanted
to do for a really long time.

20:18.324 --> 20:20.387
And I was wondering...
You know...

20:21.573 --> 20:24.690
...hoping, that maybe you and I
could be together.

20:26.408 --> 20:27.908
You want to be with me ?!

20:28.605 --> 20:30.159
Yeah. I mean Fez...

20:30.159 --> 20:34.386
my life has been so crappy lately that
you have been the one good thing.

20:35.529 --> 20:39.496
Well. So you want me because you're
lonely ? Great, so that makes me what,
your last resort ?

20:41.247 --> 20:44.136
- No Fez. You're wrong, it's not...
- You know what Jackie, forget it.

20:45.326 --> 20:48.980
You went to be with Kelso and Hyde.
I don't wanna be your sloppy thirds.

21:08.814 --> 21:11.847
Hey guys. Want to cross some more
of those heart pills.

21:12.327 --> 21:13.889
Well actually, we have all we need.

21:14.348 --> 21:16.034
Oh. Really ?

21:16.653 --> 21:18.876
Sure would be a shame if you ran
out just when you needed it.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.733
Like say you're driving your car and
all of a sudden you find that your break
lines have been cut.

21:23.654 --> 21:24.702
Who would do that ?

21:24.939 --> 21:25.953
I don't know...

21:26.266 --> 21:27.765
Maybe a guy who knows a guy.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.920
But hey, if you guys don't need 'em,
you don't need 'em.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.109
Drive safe.

21:32.109 --> 21:33.159
I'll take 20 pills...

21:33.159 --> 21:35.888
That's what I like to hear.
You did the right thing.
