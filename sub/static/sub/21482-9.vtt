The world
will have to deal with us.

00:46.499 --> 00:48.149
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

00:48.249 --> 00:51.149
- What the hell are you doing?
- <i>Diana's not quite herself right now.</i>

00:51.249 --> 00:52.849
<i>She'll do whatever
tess tells her to.</i>

00:52.949 --> 00:54.949
<i>Tess is schizophrenic.</i>

00:55.049 --> 00:57.249
The strain of hiding out,
the guilt over what we did,

00:57.349 --> 00:59.449
she can't handle it.
It's caused a break.

00:59.549 --> 01:01.249
<i>She needs medical care.</i>

01:01.349 --> 01:04.016
<i>I will not sacrifice
Tess to you.</i>

01:04.238 --> 01:06.094
<i>You made your choice,
but you're my daughter.</i>

01:06.194 --> 01:07.841
<i>If you quit this now,
I'll stand by you.</i>

01:12.586 --> 01:13.586
Daddy?

01:13.686 --> 01:15.757
<i>What about my father?
Has anybody heard from him?</i>

01:16.649 --> 01:18.149
<i>They did something to me
last night.</i>

01:18.249 --> 01:21.049
<i>Those people who came into my room
were dressed for an operation.</i>

01:21.149 --> 01:22.400
<i>They put something into me.</i>

01:23.428 --> 01:24.428
<i>Matthew Ross...</i>

01:24.528 --> 01:27.249
<i>What if they took whatever
is inside of him and put it into me?</i>

01:27.349 --> 01:29.982
- Please tell me that you're still you.
- I think so.

02:00.982 --> 02:02.249
Sorry. I know it's late.

02:02.349 --> 02:05.182
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
- No, I was just...

02:05.282 --> 02:07.332
Good, because I didn't know
where else to go.

02:07.999 --> 02:10.749
I was out with friends.
The rep is doing a revival of "Arcadia".

02:10.848 --> 02:13.000
You know that...
Tom Stoppard play?

02:14.074 --> 02:17.174
Anyway, when the show let out,
I found this on my windshield.

02:17.574 --> 02:19.300
Every car on the block
had one.

02:20.857 --> 02:23.049
So basically, if you want
to be cool, take promicin.

02:23.149 --> 02:25.899
Today on the news, I heard
a story about two middle school kids

02:25.999 --> 02:27.849
who took the shot.
12 years old.

02:27.949 --> 02:29.349
Both died.

02:29.707 --> 02:31.400
We're losing the war, Tom.

03:16.140 --> 03:17.209
<i>My God, thank you...</i>

03:19.949 --> 03:21.349
This one's my favorite.

03:21.949 --> 03:23.774
Come on, everyone.
Let's dance.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.949
Hello. This is Shawn.

03:51.049 --> 03:52.749
<i>Shawn,
it's Kevin Burkhoff.</i>

03:53.699 --> 03:55.282
Listen to me,
I don't have much time.

03:55.549 --> 03:56.849
It's tess, all right?

03:57.049 --> 03:59.549
<i>Her schizophrenia
is out of control.</i>

03:59.649 --> 04:01.949
<I>I have tried every combination of meds
I can think of.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.049
Nothing works.

04:03.149 --> 04:05.282
So you have to help her.
Or heal her.

04:05.399 --> 04:06.416
Before she hurts someone.

04:06.749 --> 04:08.049
Can you get her
to the center?

04:08.149 --> 04:09.423
<I>No, listen to me.

04:09.523 --> 04:12.449
She's taking over a diner,
all right?

04:12.549 --> 04:14.382
<I>She won't allow
anyone to leave.

04:14.849 --> 04:15.899
<i>We're trapped here.</i>

04:18.266 --> 04:19.666
Put down the phone.

04:19.815 --> 04:20.999
<i>Dr. Burkhoff?</i>

04:21.249 --> 04:23.300
Where are you?
Where's the diner located?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.666
<i>So this is the last one
and then I'm really leaving.</i>

04:28.766 --> 04:30.049
<i>I've kept you up long enough.</i>

04:30.149 --> 04:32.082
<i>Maybe I should put on
some coffee.</i>

04:33.049 --> 04:34.849
<i>You let me sit here
for hours,</i>

04:34.949 --> 04:37.549
<i>ranting about promicin
and Jordan Collier, and...</i>

04:37.949 --> 04:40.299
<i>instead of kicking me out,
you're offering me coffee?</i>

04:40.699 --> 04:42.599
That's so... sweet.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.800
I don't know about sweet.
Selfish maybe.

04:47.357 --> 04:50.549
Since kyle left,
it's been pretty lonely around here.

04:50.649 --> 04:52.982
Besides, I know how
stressful the job can be.

04:53.182 --> 04:56.432
I'm the guy who thought he was possessed
by some entity from the future.

04:56.532 --> 04:59.349
I had a perfectly harmless mole
removed for no good reason.

04:59.449 --> 05:00.832
But it's healing, though, right?

05:00.932 --> 05:02.500
- Let me look.
- Yeah, I think so.

05:11.073 --> 05:12.073
Sorry.

05:13.149 --> 05:14.766
I don't know
why I did that.

05:15.341 --> 05:17.800
Maybe we could both
use some coffee.

05:20.950 --> 05:21.950
Maybe later.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.849
Tell me again
why we're doing this

05:30.949 --> 05:32.499
at 6:30 in the morning?

05:33.649 --> 05:36.800
Because I like to have
fresh tomatoes with my eggs.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.967
Besides, I love
working in the garden.

05:42.274 --> 05:45.624
It makes me feel like I'm contributing,
even though I don't have an ability.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.724
I've got to admit,
it's pretty amazing.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.266
A week ago, this place
was a toxic wasteland, and now we're...

05:53.791 --> 05:55.500
having our first harvest.

05:56.712 --> 05:58.900
Well, you're amazed now.

06:00.033 --> 06:01.700
Wait till we get
to actually eat them.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.707
Okay. Very funny.

06:09.549 --> 06:11.000
Who's doing that?

06:25.383 --> 06:26.383
Dad?

06:27.650 --> 06:28.900
Hello, Isabelle.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.109
So...

07:36.725 --> 07:38.200
What's it been now?
Six months?

07:39.300 --> 07:40.624
Something like that.

07:41.024 --> 07:44.500
I have to say, all that time,
you don't seem so glad to see me.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.433
The last time I saw you,
you tried to kill me.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.249
Isabelle, I'm not here
to hurt you.

07:51.349 --> 07:52.566
How'd you get in here?

07:53.049 --> 07:54.316
I have friends.

07:54.749 --> 07:56.482
4400s
who live here now,

07:56.949 --> 07:58.699
left a key for me
under the mat.

07:59.049 --> 08:01.807
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
a moment alone with my daughter.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.057
Kyle, it's okay.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.012
- You sure?
- Yeah.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
Why are you here?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.300
I wanted to apologize.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.983
To tell you how sorry I am
for being such a lousy father.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.900
I guess I wasn't exactly
the best daughter.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.749
You needed guidance.

08:22.849 --> 08:24.624
Someone to teach you
right from wrong.

08:25.157 --> 08:28.000
And I wasn't there for you.
I tried, but didn't do a very good job.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.107
You were so powerful,
even as a baby.

08:31.232 --> 08:33.049
I was never comfortable
with that.

08:33.448 --> 08:35.100
And then you grew up
overnight.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.982
And your mother aging
the way she did.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.532
I tried to deny it, but...

08:41.249 --> 08:43.298
I guess part of me
blamed you for her death.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.300
Maybe I was responsible.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.400
I still don't know.

08:50.258 --> 08:52.674
- But I never meant to hurt her.
- I know that.

08:52.774 --> 08:54.503
But all the other
bad things I did...

08:57.700 --> 08:58.800
They were my fault.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.400
My decisions.
Not yours.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.267
You weren't ready to make
those kinds of decisions.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.300
You were used
by the future,

09:07.100 --> 09:08.849
by Dennis Ryland.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.616
If I had been stronger,
I could have prevented all that.

09:11.716 --> 09:14.249
But instead, I allowed things
to get ugly between us.

09:14.349 --> 09:15.749
And we both
paid the price.

09:15.849 --> 09:18.407
All I want is for us
to be father and daughter again.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.100
I want that, too.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.207
You'll stay, right?

09:22.649 --> 09:23.657
I want you to.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.107
So do I.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.257
Hello, Richard.

09:31.149 --> 09:32.600
Welcome to Promise City.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.424
Oh, sorry.

09:44.989 --> 09:47.670
Tom, the second time we did it
with the lights on, it's not like

09:47.770 --> 09:50.602
there's anything you haven't seen.
Could you help me with this zip?

09:53.199 --> 09:55.382
I'll have to make
a quick stop at home to change.

09:55.949 --> 09:58.207
Good. Then we won't be
showing up at the same time.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.249
This is only going to be weird
if we let it.

10:01.349 --> 10:03.266
- And we're not going to, right?
- Right.

10:04.349 --> 10:05.499
Last night was...

10:06.282 --> 10:07.282
Fun.

10:07.849 --> 10:10.716
It's been a rough couple of months.
We both needed a little...

10:11.400 --> 10:12.857
distraction,
a little comfort,

10:13.357 --> 10:15.957
But it doesn't have to be
anything more than that. Okay?

10:16.391 --> 10:18.770
So, you're saying last night
was just a...

10:19.304 --> 10:20.304
one-time thing?

10:21.800 --> 10:22.800
Well, yeah.

10:23.783 --> 10:24.783
I think so.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.000
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.925
You have that list I asked for?

10:32.049 --> 10:34.249
Every diner
in the greater Seattle area

10:34.349 --> 10:35.632
that has a jukebox.

10:35.749 --> 10:37.324
You sure
it was '50s music you heard?

10:37.424 --> 10:38.957
Pretty sure,
I heard Chuck Berry.

10:39.349 --> 10:42.349
You're gonna have to cancel all
my appointments for today and tomorrow.

10:42.449 --> 10:44.816
Are you sure you should be
going after Dr. Burkhoff?

10:44.966 --> 10:47.608
He's a wanted man.
You could get in a lot of trouble.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.464
Kevin saved my life,
and the lives of all the other 4400s

10:50.564 --> 10:53.432
after the government's inhibitor program
almost killed us all.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.828
And besides, if there's anyone that can
reduce the risk of taking promicin...

10:59.000 --> 11:00.007
It's him.

11:00.349 --> 11:01.357
He's worth it.

11:22.034 --> 11:23.400
What's wrong
with everyone?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.949
Why aren't they dancing?
Are they trying to ruin my party?

11:28.549 --> 11:30.766
They've been dancing
for two days.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.649
They're exhausted.
They need sleep. So do you.

11:33.749 --> 11:36.749
Sleep? Why would anyone
want to sleep? It's a party.

11:36.849 --> 11:39.400
What would Bobby think
if he showed up and I was sleeping?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.700
I love you, Bobby.

11:43.574 --> 11:45.600
He has eyes
like Montgomery Clift.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.707
Soulful, you know?

11:48.149 --> 11:50.695
Where is he anyway?
Why isn't he here yet?

11:51.678 --> 11:52.900
Maybe he's not coming.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.549
You're just jealous.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.649
Because Bobby's my boyfriend
and you're not.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.249
- That's not why.
- No, I don't want to hear it.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.699
Bobby cares about me.
He's so sweet.

12:03.149 --> 12:04.482
He'd do anything for me.

12:05.049 --> 12:07.600
Everybody, get up.
Everybody, dance.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.807
So...

12:26.191 --> 12:27.603
One fugitive to another,

12:27.849 --> 12:30.216
tell me how you managed
to stay off NTAC's radar

12:30.316 --> 12:31.316
all these months.

12:32.049 --> 12:33.200
I had lots of help.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.500
4400s who risked
their freedom to...

12:37.600 --> 12:38.941
to give me shelter,

12:39.391 --> 12:41.007
money, pretty much
anything I needed.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.082
These friends of yours...

12:44.649 --> 12:48.449
How do they feel about promicin?
About people developing abilities?

12:48.549 --> 12:50.407
The world's changed.
You changed it.

12:52.107 --> 12:54.349
They're just trying to
figure out where they fit in.

12:54.449 --> 12:55.816
I'll tell you
where they fit in.

12:55.957 --> 12:57.200
Right here in Promise City.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.800
Everyone with an ability
belongs here.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.300
This is a pretty amazing place
you've created here.

13:11.617 --> 13:14.500
Oh, I didn't do it.
Not alone, anyway.

13:15.291 --> 13:16.749
Everyone here...

13:16.849 --> 13:19.132
has helped to make
Promise City a reality,

13:19.532 --> 13:20.700
including you.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.300
No, I'm serious.

13:25.257 --> 13:28.174
All the work that you did
for me at the center,

13:28.449 --> 13:30.149
everything that
you accomplished,

13:30.832 --> 13:32.399
it all led to us being here.

13:33.649 --> 13:34.666
If you say so.

13:34.849 --> 13:36.549
But there is work
yet ahead of us.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.700
Plenty of it.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.191
And I could use
your help, Richard.

13:40.449 --> 13:43.749
I guess telekinesis could come in handy
In case the government ever decided...

13:43.849 --> 13:46.249
That's a remarkable ability, yes,

13:46.349 --> 13:48.382
but it's your leadership
I could really use.

13:48.849 --> 13:51.349
These people, they respect you.
They listen to you.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.100
You can make
a big difference.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.133
I'm here to reconnect with my daughter,
not join the movement.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.467
Well, I hope you'll
consider doing both.

14:14.557 --> 14:16.649
Kyle says they're
throwing you a welcome party.

14:16.749 --> 14:18.157
I guess I should
feel honored.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.391
Mr. Tyler!

14:21.091 --> 14:23.300
It's so good
to have you with us.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.800
Thank you.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.549
You see that?

14:29.649 --> 14:31.582
Everyone's glad
you're here.

14:31.949 --> 14:33.257
Including me.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.257
Jordan's been great,
and Kyle, too,

14:37.357 --> 14:39.449
but... I'm the only person
here without an ability.

14:39.549 --> 14:41.041
I still feel
like I don't belong.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.100
I was kind of hoping
you could help me find my way.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.600
That's why I'm here,
Isabelle.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.600
To help you all I can.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.800
Starting right now.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.783
You're going to feel a little dizzy,
Isabelle. Don't be scared.

15:01.850 --> 15:02.850
Daddy?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.007
It's okay.

15:06.241 --> 15:07.900
Everything's going to be
just fine.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.841
Richard's gone.
I think Isabelle's with him.

15:40.949 --> 15:42.100
Wait for it.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.699
No doubt about it.
The man is a genuine badass.

15:51.799 --> 15:54.116
Maybe when we catch him,
you can ask for his autograph.

15:54.216 --> 15:56.040
Now we know why
we never caught up with him.

15:56.140 --> 15:58.849
- He's hiding out with Jordan Collier.
- I don't think so.

15:58.949 --> 16:00.749
If Richard was with Collier,
we would've known about it.

16:00.849 --> 16:02.349
He's too important
to be kept in the background.

16:02.449 --> 16:05.040
Somehow, he managed to get into
Promise City without us even knowing,

16:05.140 --> 16:07.294
which means he could have left
just as discreetly.

16:07.449 --> 16:08.599
He looked like
he was in a hurry.

16:08.699 --> 16:10.932
I couldn't tell if isabelle
was unconscious or dead.

16:11.032 --> 16:12.849
He did try to kill her
once before, right?

16:12.949 --> 16:15.249
If she were dead,
why carry the body away?

16:15.349 --> 16:17.249
I think it looks like
a kidnapping.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.449
Well, I guess we won't know
for certain until we find him.

16:19.549 --> 16:22.049
Well, we could start
by talking to Jordan Collier.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.949
He did say he was willing
to keep the communication lines open,

16:25.049 --> 16:26.599
so let's see how serious he is.

16:27.049 --> 16:28.132
Knock on his front door.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.500
See if anyone answers.

16:42.691 --> 16:43.774
Take it easy.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.337
Your head's going to hurt
for a little while.

16:47.449 --> 16:48.649
Drink some water.

16:48.749 --> 16:49.874
You'll feel better.

16:52.700 --> 16:53.907
What did you do to me?

16:54.391 --> 16:56.257
Stopped the flow of blood
to your brain.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.900
Only for a few seconds.

16:59.241 --> 17:00.624
Just enough
for you to pass out.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.800
Why?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.099
Where are you taking me?

17:06.099 --> 17:07.707
Away from Collier's war.

17:08.049 --> 17:09.549
Away from Promise City.

17:09.707 --> 17:11.099
We don't belong there.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.700
That's the only place
we're safe.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.348
The government, NTAC,
they're all going to come after us.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.732
They're not going to find us,
I promise.

17:22.949 --> 17:25.507
I'm sorry I had to do it like that,
but it's for the best.

17:28.050 --> 17:30.067
From now on, we're going
to be a family again.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.550
We've got a long trip ahead of us.
You should eat something.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.400
I'm not hungry.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.200
I want to go back.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.500
That's not going to happen.
You have to accept that.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.800
Come on.
You got to keep your strength up.

17:51.117 --> 17:52.300
At least drink some water.

18:07.057 --> 18:09.274
Please.
I can't do it anymore.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.500
It's been two days.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.174
I need to stop.
Rest.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.200
I don't believe this.
Wake him up.

18:25.641 --> 18:26.923
The rest of you, keep dancing.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.715
I'll get him some water.
Come with me.

18:31.607 --> 18:34.649
You are torturing those poor people
and it's going to stop right now.

18:34.749 --> 18:38.149
This is my big night, Kevin.
A girl only turns 16 once.

18:38.249 --> 18:41.349
You turned 16
back in 1953.

18:41.449 --> 18:42.649
That was a long time ago.

18:42.749 --> 18:45.049
And you never even had
a sweet 16 party.

18:45.149 --> 18:48.207
You told me you had your first
schizophrenic attack the night before,

18:48.307 --> 18:49.649
and your parents called it off.

18:49.749 --> 18:51.249
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

18:51.349 --> 18:52.949
This is my party!

18:53.049 --> 18:54.632
I want Bobby.
Where's Bobby?

18:54.732 --> 18:58.149
Listen to me. Even if Bobby were alive,
he'd be, like, what?

18:58.249 --> 18:59.466
- 70?
- That's a lie.

18:59.582 --> 19:01.182
You don't know
what you're saying.

19:01.299 --> 19:03.349
Look at those people.
Look at them.

19:03.449 --> 19:05.100
You see
what you're doing to them?

19:06.100 --> 19:08.833
Get your hand off me.

19:15.091 --> 19:16.091
Don't!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.683
I'm afraid
there's not much to say, Tom.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.000
Richard Tyler
was only here for a few hours.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.474
I'm afraid he didn't inform me
of any plot to kidnap his daughter.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.607
Do you have any idea
where he's taken her?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.832
Did he mention where he's been hiding
the last few months?

19:36.932 --> 19:38.202
Safe house?
Friends?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.949
Sorry, dad.
He didn't tell us anything.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.119
There is one name.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.702
Michael Ancelet.

19:44.189 --> 19:45.184
Ancelet?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.451
I remember that name.
He's an original 4400.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.564
When Richard was running
security at the center,

19:49.684 --> 19:50.916
Michael was his deputy.

19:51.185 --> 19:54.011
If Richard goes to anyone for help,
it might well be him.

19:54.271 --> 19:55.606
Thanks for the lead.

19:56.057 --> 19:57.456
I hope it pans out.

20:02.446 --> 20:04.331
Jordan,
why would you help them?

20:04.451 --> 20:06.533
My dad'll throw
Richard and Isabelle in prison.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.670
We welcomed Richard Tyler
into our home.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.980
We trusted him.

20:10.514 --> 20:12.683
He broke that trust.
We owe him nothing.

20:13.923 --> 20:14.937
Besides,

20:15.792 --> 20:18.672
helping NTAC
apprehend a fugitive

20:18.792 --> 20:20.470
puts your father in our debt.

20:20.983 --> 20:22.092
That could prove useful.

20:22.212 --> 20:24.377
What about Isabelle?
Do you care what happens to her?

20:24.509 --> 20:26.608
Kyle, I understand
you two have grown close,

20:27.880 --> 20:30.639
but Isabelle's role in the movement
has never been clearly defined.

20:30.759 --> 20:33.329
Neither the book nor Cassie...

20:33.752 --> 20:35.511
have made any mention
of her importance.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.711
She's important to me.

20:38.252 --> 20:40.143
I'm going to find her
before my father does.

20:42.161 --> 20:43.227
A rescue attempt

20:44.274 --> 20:45.495
is reckless at best.

20:47.052 --> 20:48.057
Losing you

20:48.235 --> 20:50.846
vastly outweighs the
benefit of finding Isabelle.

20:51.943 --> 20:53.320
Don't do anything foolish.

21:08.117 --> 21:10.032
How long
have you been planning this?

21:13.104 --> 21:15.404
Ever since I found out
you moved to Promise City.

21:17.554 --> 21:19.285
You could probably use some sleep.

21:19.762 --> 21:22.128
Your room is at the top of the stairs
through the door.

21:29.251 --> 21:30.894
Dad, this is a kid's room.

21:32.493 --> 21:34.737
There's no way I'm going
to fit in that little bed.

21:35.266 --> 21:36.364
Don't worry about it.

21:36.842 --> 21:38.091
I've got that covered.

21:40.262 --> 21:41.642
You're going to be happy here.

21:42.065 --> 21:43.098
Safe.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.079
I'll be sure of it.

22:25.568 --> 22:26.929
<i>Daddy!</i>

22:32.732 --> 22:33.990
Everything's okay.

22:35.007 --> 22:36.077
Don't be scared.

22:36.802 --> 22:39.300
Something's wrong.
I think I'm shrinking.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.867
What did you do to me?

22:41.854 --> 22:44.164
I told you, Isabelle,
we're starting over.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.308
You're not get smaller,
you're getting younger.

22:48.071 --> 22:49.273
What?

22:52.860 --> 22:55.665
Daddy, what am I?
14? 15?

22:56.149 --> 22:57.151
For now, anyway.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.987
What is that supposed to mean?

22:59.107 --> 23:00.523
How much younger
am I gonna get?

23:00.643 --> 23:02.259
I'm just trying to help you,
Isabelle.

23:02.569 --> 23:04.438
Find a way to make
things better for you.

23:04.664 --> 23:06.326
For month,
it's all I could think about.

23:06.617 --> 23:07.988
Then I met Cora.

23:09.162 --> 23:10.277
She has an amazing ability.

23:10.397 --> 23:12.233
She can actually
make people younger.

23:12.919 --> 23:14.235
That's what I could give you.

23:14.498 --> 23:16.973
A chance to start over,
to have a normal childhood.

23:17.093 --> 23:19.145
Soon, you'll forget about
all those terrible things you did,

23:19.265 --> 23:20.767
all those regrets
weighing you down.

23:20.887 --> 23:22.927
Daddy, I was doing fine on my own.

23:23.290 --> 23:25.816
You don't have to do this, daddy.
Please.

23:29.881 --> 23:32.069
Do you know what the happiest
day of my life was?

23:33.555 --> 23:35.439
It was back
when we were living at the center.

23:36.315 --> 23:39.325
Your mother was working for the
healing foundation with Shawn.

23:39.869 --> 23:42.321
I took you to Madison park.
To the playground.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.933
I put you on my lap,
and we sat on one of the swings,

23:45.053 --> 23:46.956
and I rocked you back and forth,
it must've been 20 min.

23:47.076 --> 23:48.349
You laughed the whole time.

23:49.741 --> 23:50.990
It was a perfect day.

23:54.588 --> 23:56.441
The next morning,
you woke up 20 years older,

23:56.561 --> 23:58.268
and your mother was
dying in front of my eyes.

23:58.388 --> 24:00.977
I want us to be able to start over,
and now we can.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.709
I have started over.

24:04.372 --> 24:07.714
I have my own life now.
It might not be perfect, but it's mine.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.944
Please don't take
that away from me, daddy.

24:10.064 --> 24:11.475
I know this is scary for you,

24:12.277 --> 24:14.404
but soon,
you won't remember any of this.

24:31.074 --> 24:32.962
This is the water
you gave me in the car.

24:34.972 --> 24:36.596
That's how this all started,
isn't it?

24:37.348 --> 24:38.512
It's in the water?

24:39.465 --> 24:41.165
Is that how you're doing this?

25:02.711 --> 25:04.345
Kevin, I brought you some butter.

25:04.514 --> 25:06.458
My mom said it's good for burns.

25:06.735 --> 25:08.454
Thank you, but my hand's fine.

25:09.387 --> 25:11.810
How could that be?
It was all black and blistered.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.716
I can heal myself, Tess.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.700
It's my ability from
when I took the shot.

25:17.995 --> 25:21.377
Just like you can compel people
to do things against their will.

25:26.313 --> 25:28.292
Sometime, Kevin,

25:28.412 --> 25:30.408
you say the craziest things.

25:30.941 --> 25:32.810
I guess that's why I like you.

25:34.559 --> 25:36.362
Oh, my goodness!
That must be Bobby.

25:36.896 --> 25:39.356
Everybody,
look like you're having fun.

25:42.627 --> 25:43.775
Hey, Tess.

25:44.158 --> 25:45.161
Bobby?

25:45.281 --> 25:47.216
It's about time, Bobby.
Tess was worried.

25:47.336 --> 25:49.451
She was afraid
you weren't going to show up, Bobby.

25:50.093 --> 25:51.173
Where you been?

25:51.449 --> 25:53.552
I'm sorry. I had some car trouble.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.033
Well, you're here now.

25:56.879 --> 25:58.842
- That's all that matters.
- What are you doing?

25:58.962 --> 26:00.974
Bobby is gonna help you, Tess.

26:01.094 --> 26:02.524
He's gonna make you
feel better.

26:02.646 --> 26:03.663
I feel fine.

26:03.783 --> 26:05.612
Believe me, you're not fine.

26:06.167 --> 26:07.855
But that's okay.
I can make that all better.

26:07.975 --> 26:09.672
All you have to do
is take my hands.

26:09.792 --> 26:12.031
- It's real easy.
- No. Don't touch me.

26:12.587 --> 26:13.893
You're not Bobby.

26:14.013 --> 26:15.648
You two are playing a joke on me.

26:15.789 --> 26:17.714
A horrible, nasty joke.

26:21.536 --> 26:22.757
You're right, I'm not Bobby,

26:22.938 --> 26:24.589
but I really am here to help you, Tess.

26:24.709 --> 26:25.926
You're sick, Tess.

26:26.233 --> 26:27.360
Shawn is a healer.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.820
There's nothing wrong with me.
Stop saying there is.

26:30.953 --> 26:33.338
- Listen to me.
- No. Gloria needs a partner.

26:34.684 --> 26:37.126
- Tess, listen to me.
- No talking. Just dancing.

26:38.881 --> 26:39.919
And you...

26:40.501 --> 26:41.790
You're not my friend anymore.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.452
You're mean.

26:44.288 --> 26:45.471
I hate you.

26:57.851 --> 26:59.513
Why are you still her, Kyle?

27:00.312 --> 27:01.561
Isabelle needs you.

27:02.465 --> 27:03.601
I promised Jordan.

27:03.770 --> 27:04.771
Jordan is wrong.

27:05.478 --> 27:06.783
Don't look so surprised.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.225
Even Messiahs
make mistakes sometimes.

27:09.534 --> 27:11.092
Do you know
where Richard took her?

27:11.613 --> 27:13.087
As a matter of fact, I do.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.744
I'll be right with you.

27:18.987 --> 27:20.771
I just have
to get this thought down.

27:21.847 --> 27:24.791
Seems like you've had
a lot of those lately, Mr. Ancelet.

27:25.051 --> 27:26.358
It's my autobiography.

27:27.887 --> 27:29.365
You must have had a busy life.

27:29.485 --> 27:30.963
I'm about to start on fourth grade.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.964
What are we talking about here?
Some kind of total recall?

27:34.084 --> 27:35.842
That's right.
I remember

27:36.263 --> 27:39.188
people, events,
dreams, thoughts even.

27:39.308 --> 27:41.441
If I experienced, I remember it.
All of it.

27:41.581 --> 27:43.708
- You're writing it all down.
- Only thing that keeps me sane.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.097
Otherwise, it just...

27:46.138 --> 27:48.955
builds up in my head, until it feels
like my brain is gonna explode.

27:49.075 --> 27:50.844
Mr. Ancelet,
you know why we're here?

27:55.102 --> 27:56.921
- Richard Tyler.
- Do you know where he is?

27:57.041 --> 27:58.381
I know he's my friend.

28:01.317 --> 28:02.612
I understand.

28:02.738 --> 28:04.109
Friendship's important.

28:05.735 --> 28:06.796
But, Mike,

28:06.970 --> 28:09.433
aiding and abetting a fugitive?
A 4400?

28:09.553 --> 28:11.747
That's a...
That's a prison sentence.

28:12.377 --> 28:14.632
And in that prison,
you're not gonna get computers,

28:14.892 --> 28:16.080
or pens, or paper.

28:16.375 --> 28:17.924
It'll just be you.
Alone...

28:18.246 --> 28:19.354
with your thoughts.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.957
Where are you?

29:32.515 --> 29:33.717
How's that soup?

29:34.518 --> 29:36.180
I like the noodles.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.624
That boy?

29:41.570 --> 29:42.922
The one at the center.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.724
The one I liked so much?

29:45.391 --> 29:46.837
What was his name again?

29:47.448 --> 29:48.559
Shawn Farrell.

29:49.384 --> 29:50.718
I was mean to him...

29:51.300 --> 29:52.436
Wasn't I?

29:53.955 --> 29:56.405
I'm having a hard
time remembering things.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.931
That's okay.

30:01.596 --> 30:02.939
We'll make new memories.

30:03.539 --> 30:04.600
Better ones.

30:08.104 --> 30:09.683
All it takes is...

30:09.984 --> 30:11.223
one big sip,

30:12.114 --> 30:13.128
then we're done.

30:13.485 --> 30:14.668
And then what?

30:15.494 --> 30:17.146
I won't be me anymore.

30:17.879 --> 30:19.798
It'll be like I never existed.

30:20.300 --> 30:21.520
If your mother were here,

30:22.164 --> 30:23.498
she'd want us to do this.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.921
She'd want us to be
a family again.

30:26.287 --> 30:27.470
Be together.

30:30.512 --> 30:31.695
Stay here.

30:54.557 --> 30:55.994
What did you do to her?

30:56.323 --> 30:58.435
It's a 4400 ability.

30:58.896 --> 31:01.037
He wants to turn me
into a baby again.

31:01.255 --> 31:02.823
Richar, this is crazy.

31:03.177 --> 31:04.286
You have to stop this.

31:04.406 --> 31:07.106
This is between me and my daughter.
It has nothing to do with you.

31:07.226 --> 31:08.733
Daddy, don't.

31:09.531 --> 31:10.808
Kyle is my friend.

31:10.993 --> 31:13.472
He's the first person
who ever believed in me,

31:13.967 --> 31:15.771
believes that I could change.

31:15.891 --> 31:17.542
She's not
the same person you knew.

31:17.662 --> 31:19.372
If you'd spent more time
in Promise City,

31:19.503 --> 31:21.233
you'd have seen that.
Come on, Isabelle.

31:22.570 --> 31:23.890
Where do you think
you're going?

31:24.010 --> 31:25.148
Away from here.

31:25.373 --> 31:27.195
We'll fix this, okay?
I promise you.

31:37.212 --> 31:38.743
Can I talk to you for a second?

31:40.948 --> 31:42.215
It's about Bobby.

31:42.864 --> 31:44.038
He's here.

31:45.397 --> 31:46.414
No, he's not.

31:46.534 --> 31:48.052
Yes, he is.
He's right over there.

31:51.441 --> 31:52.765
That's just Kevin.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.497
Hey, Bobby loves you, right?

31:56.489 --> 31:57.832
He's always there for you.

31:58.020 --> 31:59.766
He'd do anything
to make you happy.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.005
Yes, he would.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.976
Then I'm telling yoy, that's Bobby.

32:03.937 --> 32:04.970
Go over to him.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.641
Look into his eyes.
See for yourself.

32:25.609 --> 32:26.674
Bobby?

32:27.421 --> 32:28.754
Is that really you?

32:36.096 --> 32:38.236
I've been waiting for you
a long time.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.906
Well, I'm here now.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.786
Promise
you'll never leave me again.

33:04.564 --> 33:06.019
I promise.

33:32.147 --> 33:33.302
I'm so tired.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.225
I know you are.

33:39.583 --> 33:40.870
Shawn can help.

33:42.134 --> 33:43.730
He can make you feel better.

33:44.448 --> 33:45.697
Would you like that?

33:47.990 --> 33:49.445
That would be nice.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.656
You ready?

34:33.668 --> 34:34.683
Kevin?

34:35.335 --> 34:36.556
I was so scared.

34:37.844 --> 34:38.888
And sick.

34:40.032 --> 34:41.750
I hurt these people, didn't I?

34:42.751 --> 34:44.018
It's all right.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.962
You're better now.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.375
And you're going to be
better from now on.

34:49.056 --> 34:50.233
I'm so sorry.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.134
We should go.

34:57.290 --> 34:58.341
Wait.

34:58.550 --> 35:00.626
They're not gonna remember
any of this, right?

35:07.208 --> 35:09.020
Not if I don't want them to.

35:19.699 --> 35:21.043
Backup's five minutes out.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.488
We should go in now.

35:22.648 --> 35:24.390
- What?
- If we go in hot,

35:24.510 --> 35:26.149
we'll be forcing Richard
to fight back.

35:26.269 --> 35:28.642
And you was what he did to
the guardsmen outside Promise City.

35:28.762 --> 35:30.362
You really think
you can talk him down?

35:30.482 --> 35:31.558
It's worth a try.

35:45.084 --> 35:46.633
I'm not gonna hurt him, Isabelle.

35:46.984 --> 35:48.096
You have my word.

35:52.314 --> 35:53.723
Richard.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.347
Look, it's over, all right?

35:56.301 --> 35:57.380
Dad?

36:13.046 --> 36:14.341
We have to go, Isabelle.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.319
Oh, boy.

36:46.995 --> 36:47.999
You okay?

36:49.144 --> 36:50.487
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

36:54.774 --> 36:56.379
Diana, do me a favor,

36:56.499 --> 36:58.020
make sure
everyone's okay out there.

36:58.140 --> 37:00.638
And stall them
as long as you can, okay?

37:01.336 --> 37:02.650
I'll see what I can do.

37:03.602 --> 37:04.633
Where's your car?

37:04.753 --> 37:06.111
- Out back.
- Come on.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.183
NTAC doesn't know you're here.
This way.

37:09.383 --> 37:11.645
But I'd stay off
the main roads just to be safe.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.917
You're letting me go?

37:14.578 --> 37:15.959
Yeah, it looks that way.

37:17.222 --> 37:19.241
You going to be able
to get back to Promise City?

37:19.474 --> 37:20.676
I got out, didn't I?

37:21.028 --> 37:22.277
Thanks, dad.

37:25.382 --> 37:26.631
Okay, go. Just go.

37:30.959 --> 37:31.963
Promise City?

37:33.179 --> 37:35.207
That's the last place
I'd want to live.

37:35.816 --> 37:37.581
I thought that you and Jordan
were close.

37:37.830 --> 37:39.098
Not anymore.

37:39.248 --> 37:40.440
He scares me.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.277
He always has.

37:43.234 --> 37:46.633
Yeah, this messiah
complex he's developed.

37:46.980 --> 37:48.203
Very disturbing.

37:48.354 --> 37:50.125
And all this talk
about heaven and Earth,

37:50.245 --> 37:52.292
frankly, I don't buy it.

37:52.582 --> 37:54.376
You guys can stay
here as long as you like.

37:54.496 --> 37:56.712
Well, that would be wonderful,
but we're fugitives.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.724
If they track us here,
you could be in a lot of trouble.

38:00.182 --> 38:01.882
That's a risk iI'm willing to take.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.731
You can use
our medical facilities

38:03.851 --> 38:05.213
to continue your research.

38:05.335 --> 38:07.062
Find a way to make promicin safer.

38:07.955 --> 38:09.100
Tell him, Kevin.

38:09.795 --> 38:10.820
What?

38:11.269 --> 38:14.146
It's really only
a theory at this point.

38:14.266 --> 38:15.397
Well, I'd like to hear it.

38:15.725 --> 38:18.660
Well, I'm putting together profiles
of the people

38:18.780 --> 38:20.007
who have taken the shot,

38:20.127 --> 38:22.371
the ones we know of anyway,
to see if I could discover

38:22.546 --> 38:24.676
why some survive
and others don't.

38:25.117 --> 38:28.094
And the initial research

38:28.363 --> 38:30.100
is promising.

38:30.593 --> 38:32.968
Pretty soon, Kevin thinks
he'll be able to predict

38:33.097 --> 38:35.238
who will survive the shot
and who won't.

38:35.702 --> 38:38.378
And if people know for certain
that promicin will kill them,

38:39.160 --> 38:40.586
they won't take the shot.

38:42.559 --> 38:44.521
And a lot less people would die.

38:49.529 --> 38:51.492
Isabelle, did you hear
what I said to you?

38:54.516 --> 38:57.004
You don't have to drink the rest of it
if you don't want to.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.289
And if I don't, then what?

39:00.036 --> 39:02.289
I start my life over
again as an eight-year-old?

39:03.045 --> 39:04.416
We could go see Cora.

39:06.564 --> 39:08.381
Maybe she could reverse
the process.

39:09.005 --> 39:10.573
Age you back
to where you were.

39:14.858 --> 39:16.905
That boy, Kyle,
risked his life to come find you.

39:17.309 --> 39:18.999
Someone cares
that much about you.

39:20.546 --> 39:21.673
It says a lot about him.

39:22.869 --> 39:23.996
And about you.

39:36.118 --> 39:37.527
Maybe you have changed.

39:38.534 --> 39:40.149
Maybe you're a different person now.

39:40.990 --> 39:43.901
But you still want me to drink it,
don't you?

39:44.674 --> 39:47.003
I just want us to have
more perfect days, Isabelle.

39:48.525 --> 39:50.364
But like I said,
it's up to you now.

40:10.601 --> 40:11.793
I'm scared.

40:19.482 --> 40:20.562
I'm right here.

40:26.265 --> 40:27.505
You know iI had him?

40:28.200 --> 40:30.886
He was standing right there
in front of me, and I let him go.

40:32.516 --> 40:34.535
What else could you do,
arrest him?

40:35.042 --> 40:37.029
I thought if I ever
got him out of Promise City,

40:37.149 --> 40:38.743
that's exactly
what I would have done.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.396
Or if I didn't want
to bring him into NTAC,

40:40.518 --> 40:41.861
at least I would've
brought him back here

40:41.981 --> 40:43.267
until I figured out a next step.

40:43.387 --> 40:45.768
And what would you have done?
Locked Kyle in his bedroom?

40:45.888 --> 40:48.273
He would've taken off the moment
you'd turn your back.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.993
Tom, you had a choice
between Promise City and prison.

40:52.776 --> 40:55.170
If it was my kid,
I would've done exactly the same thing.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.367
Am I making you
feel any better at all?

40:59.724 --> 41:00.888
Yeah.

41:01.217 --> 41:02.297
Sorry.

41:03.234 --> 41:04.773
Thank, by the way, for...

41:05.117 --> 41:07.183
for coming over here
and letting me ramble.

41:07.652 --> 41:09.868
Sure.
We're friend, right?

41:10.177 --> 41:11.228
Yeah.

41:12.581 --> 41:13.708
Friends.

41:19.938 --> 41:21.549
Okay, we're good friends.

41:21.949 --> 41:23.136
Good friends.

41:27.511 --> 41:29.312
- What?
- I felt something behind your ear.

41:29.432 --> 41:31.035
- What?
- Turn around. Show me.

41:32.519 --> 41:33.965
Your mole is back.

42:01.231 --> 42:02.424
Daddy!
