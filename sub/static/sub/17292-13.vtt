<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.630
You're, like, really dramatic and weird.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.800
Did you see this resume?
Harvard, Yale, special skills: Mandarin?

00:08.883 --> 00:10.051
What the hell is she doing here?

00:10.135 --> 00:13.471
Why are you even in our lives?
No one really knows you.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.932
<i>I was in New York. I ran into Josh.</i> He made me feel warm inside,
like glitter was exploding inside me,

00:18.476 --> 00:19.310
then I moved here.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.647
-I love him so much.
-I know, sweetie.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.691
When we were kids,
he made me feel so happy.

00:24.774 --> 00:29.738
And if I could get back to that place,
my life would magically be okay.

00:29.821 --> 00:30.697
Josh?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.410
[screams]
The wedding is in two weeks!

00:35.493 --> 00:37.746
Of course, my father's not coming to
the wedding and walking me down the aisle.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.956
Of course! 'Cause that's a normal thing,
and normal things are not for me.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.625
<i>And Josh-- he's gonna walk out,</i>
<i>just like my dad did,</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.377
<i>and he's never gonna come back.</i>

00:44.461 --> 00:46.171
Darryl and I need to see you
in his office ASAP.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.340
Dad, you're really here!

00:52.927 --> 00:56.389
[takes deep breath]

01:30.799 --> 01:31.674
[knocking on door]

01:32.675 --> 01:34.511
-Hey, hey!
-Hi!

01:34.594 --> 01:37.055
Oh! It's all ready. You want to see it?

01:37.138 --> 01:38.056
-Yeah!
-Okay.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.560
-[sighs]
-Hm?

01:43.311 --> 01:44.896
Oh...

01:44.979 --> 01:48.733
-Look, look, look.
-Oh, Paula, it's so pretty.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.070
[chuckles]
I'm crafty. I can do stuff.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.321
Wow.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.698
Okay, but you know what?
It's all just hot-glued,

01:55.782 --> 01:58.368
and it can, like, fall apart
at any second, so just don't--

01:58.451 --> 02:00.245
Don't tug on it. Ahh!

02:00.328 --> 02:03.498
Okay. Let's just... just...

02:03.581 --> 02:04.999
[sighs]

02:06.042 --> 02:09.504
Oh, my God.
I just can't believe this is happening.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.967
Paula, I'm marrying Josh Chan.

-Hi!

04:00.406 --> 04:02.659
Um, it's three days until our wedding.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.286
-Can you believe it?
-Oh, yes. So exciting.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.330
-Then it will all be over with.
-Hey!

04:07.413 --> 04:10.041
Oh! [chuckles]
I mean, like, a wedding is great,

04:10.124 --> 04:13.586
but I'm excited
for our actual life together to start.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.213
Oh, that's sweet.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.716
But weddings are also really important

04:18.800 --> 04:21.261
'cause, you know,
it's family and tradition,

04:21.344 --> 04:23.012
and they bring everyone together.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.430
[sighs]

04:24.514 --> 04:28.226
I'm so excited that my dad's coming.
I'm so excited, Josh.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.520
And, God, when he walks me
down the aisle...

04:32.272 --> 04:34.023
it might heal things between us.

04:34.941 --> 04:35.942
Yeah.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.320
Well, I'm glad
you're so excited about him.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.031
I mean, usually you refer to him
as the "garbage father"

04:42.115 --> 04:43.700
or the "Westchester Sperm Machine."

04:45.076 --> 04:46.828
Yes, yes, you are right.

04:46.911 --> 04:50.123
You know, we've had our problems,
but that's in the past.

04:50.206 --> 04:53.293
To be honest, as a kid,
I was probably really difficult.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.045
I mean, I was dramatic and weird.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.005
[sighs]

04:57.088 --> 05:00.550
I'm kidding.
My life is practically perfect now.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.927
You know, I'm a different person.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.555
So, I really think
this is the version of Rebecca Bunch

05:05.638 --> 05:07.265
he's gonna stick around for.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.851
-[phone dings]
-Oh! Maybe that's him! Ooh!

05:10.685 --> 05:11.686
[muttering]

05:11.769 --> 05:14.647
"Hey." Oh, he's typing. He's still typing.
It's not just "Hey." It's not just "Hey."

05:14.731 --> 05:16.107
He's still typing.
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

05:16.190 --> 05:20.611
Okay, here we go. "Love to see you today,
but have work calls, so no can do.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.906
See you at rehearsal dinner. Okay?"

05:23.990 --> 05:28.786
-Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
-What? No, it's... it's fine. It's okay.

05:28.870 --> 05:33.041
Look, he texted me after 17 minutes.
It's practically an instant.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.126
And he's not going anywhere.
He's here for my wedding.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.464
You know, he's not gonna abandon me,
just like you're not gonna abandon me.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.424
Of course, I'm not abandoning you.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.219
Right. Sorry, that was a...
weird thing to say.

05:45.303 --> 05:50.808
No, I'm just-- I'm excited. I'm excited
and happy and content and excited.

05:51.851 --> 05:52.727
Mm!

05:54.103 --> 05:55.813
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

06:00.485 --> 06:02.987
This is what happy feels like.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.950
You look so pretty in that veil.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.081
Oh, Robert...

06:15.625 --> 06:18.544
-I'm sorry, what?
-What?

06:19.170 --> 06:23.800
-Uh, you just called me Robert.
-No, I didn't.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.051
Yeah, you did.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.846
You know what? I'm sorry.
I was thinking about work.

06:28.930 --> 06:33.309
We have a new client named,
um... Robert. Julia Roberts.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.187
Yeah, she's a single mom
investigating water contamination.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.190
Oh, yeah. Real spitfire, short skirts,
nice smile, real pretty woman.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.317
Anyway, sorry about that.
[giggles]

06:48.783 --> 06:49.909
[glass clinking]

06:49.992 --> 06:52.578
Excuse me! Excuse me, everyone!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.664
First of all, Josh,

06:54.747 --> 06:57.208
I just want to thank you
for including me in your stag party.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.292
I am just so excited.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.463
And, as Rebecca's boss and mentor
and White Josh's main squeeze,

07:02.547 --> 07:06.843
I feel like I'm the marshmallow that's
holding together this Rice Krispie Treat.

07:06.926 --> 07:12.974
So, to get this party started,
I had gifts made!

07:13.057 --> 07:15.184
Yeah, look at 'em. It's your couple name!

07:15.268 --> 07:18.229
ReJoshecca ChaBunch!
[chuckles]

07:18.312 --> 07:20.773
We started out with something
more complicated and whittled it down.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.109
Okay, everybody, circle 'em up.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.529
Whoo!

07:26.612 --> 07:28.573
-Yeah!
-There you go.

07:29.198 --> 07:33.578
All right. Best of luck
to the very lucky couple.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.704
Yeah, good luck.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.914
Cheers.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.459
Cheers.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.174
Hey, um--
[clears throat]

07:46.257 --> 07:49.552
-Heard about your cool client.
-Hm?

07:49.635 --> 07:52.346
The single mom investigating
water contamination?

07:52.430 --> 07:56.809
Uh, spitfire, short skirts, great smile,
real pretty woman.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.479
-Rebecca was talking about her.
-What?

07:59.562 --> 08:02.940
-That's the plot to <i>Erin Brockovich.</i>
-Oh, yeah.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.360
That's what I call
Oscar award-winning movies.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.489
"Clients." It's a code.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.282
Cool!

08:11.365 --> 08:16.454
[clears throat]
Uh, hey, just wanted to say cheers, Josh.

08:17.622 --> 08:23.503
My mom is so excited about the wedding.
Bought a great dress. Burgundy A-line.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.798
Very tasteful.
She's a winter. Little snowflake.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.846
Cool tones complement her skin.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.682
-Uh, yeah, totally.
-Sure, yeah, okay.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.975
You guys are weird.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.685
-Okay.
-We're weird.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.731
Hey, so what was that comment
under your breath just a minute ago?

08:43.814 --> 08:45.149
Oh.

08:45.233 --> 08:49.278
Dude, I love Josh,
but those are the last two people

08:49.362 --> 08:52.073
who should be getting married...
to anyone possibly ever.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.452
I don't know. Just not big into marriage
in general. You know that.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.872
No, I don't know that.
That's not a thing that I know.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.167
What? Oh, yeah, no.
It's just not my thing.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.711
Most people end up getting divorced.
I mean, you got divorced.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.631
I don't know. Having kids I get, but...

09:08.714 --> 09:10.800
getting married
just makes no sense to me.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.437
So, God is okay with you
wearing that shirt?

09:23.521 --> 09:27.400
Yeah, dude. God gave me this shirt
when I joined the seminary.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.568
That's dope.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.361
Being a priest is dope.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.614
You know, I've always thought
it was so cool

09:33.698 --> 09:37.159
how you made the ultimate commitment
and married Jesus.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.454
Hey, did you worry before you did that?

09:40.538 --> 09:45.459
Like, did Jesus ever give you
any reason to, like, have doubts?

09:45.543 --> 09:47.837
-No.
-[scoffs]

09:47.920 --> 09:51.215
Hey, man, that day I joined
the seminary in San Luis Obispo,

09:51.299 --> 09:55.845
when Father Rodrigo
welcomed me with open arms,

09:55.928 --> 09:59.223
I just... I felt at peace
with my decision, man.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.059
-I never questioned it.
-God, that's great.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.519
-Yeah.
-That must have felt amazing.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.646
It did. It really did, man.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.400
It really balances out the fact
that I don't bone.

10:09.483 --> 10:13.487
[laughs]

10:13.571 --> 10:17.199
Do you know a Robert?
Like, anybody named Robert?

10:17.283 --> 10:22.288
I personally don't know
any Roberts. Why?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.624
Nothing. Just-- Never mind.

10:30.046 --> 10:35.301
Okay! Rehearsal dinner.
Everyone's rehearsing for my life.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.012
My dad will be here soon.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.889
Oh, you look halfway decent. Good.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.267
Hey, B-T-dubs, I need you to send me
a song for the father-daughter dance.

10:43.351 --> 10:48.189
Uh, I'm sorry. Stop.
Uh, father-daughter dance?

10:48.272 --> 10:50.566
I get to dance with my dad,
like, in front of everyone?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.360
It's what people do.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.154
Uh, okay, getting married
just gets better and better

10:55.237 --> 10:56.822
'cause now I get to dance with my daddy?

10:56.906 --> 11:00.493
Daddy? Yuck. You mean
the Westchester Sperm Machine?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.537
Every time you call him "Daddy,"
I get this-- [coughs]

11:03.621 --> 11:06.624
barfy ball of phlegm
in the back of my throat.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.126
Okay, just-- Can you please--?
It's my rehearsal dinner.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.506
Right. Planned by your fiancé's
ex-girlfriend. Brilliant.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.508
[Valencia]
I'm so good at my job.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.719
Head coordinator
for assistant coordinator.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.429
Um, I'm right next to you.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.808
Tell the caterer
these need to be hand-buffed.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.018
This is a special day,
not a freaking hootenanny.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.522
-What?
-[doorbell rings]

11:29.605 --> 11:32.316
Oh, oh! Is that him? Is that him?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.654
Welcome, everyone.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.448
Help yourself to a refreshing cocktail.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.700
The staff is circulating with ceviche.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.246
I'm the wedding planner.
It's a long story. Don't ask.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.208
-Cringe-worthy.
-Hundred percent.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.376
[sighs]

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295
-How's it going?
-Hi! It's great.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.756
You know, it's funny
just 'cause, uh, Waze said

11:55.840 --> 11:57.925
that my dad's drive
should only take six minutes.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.009
Yeah. Hey, cookie.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.762
I just, um-- I know you're really excited
that your dad's here,

12:01.846 --> 12:05.057
but I just want to make sure
that you don't, like, expect him

12:05.141 --> 12:07.393
to, all of a sudden,
be a totally different person.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.145
Because I had this bookmark once,

12:09.228 --> 12:12.523
and it said the best predictor
of the future is the past--

12:12.606 --> 12:15.317
Hey, thank you so much
for telling me that 'cause I always--

12:15.401 --> 12:19.155
I-I value your opinion and I cherish
our friendship more than anything.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.741
But, um, you're so wrong. Like,
you're just-- you're wrong. So, yeah.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.995
[gasps]
Oh, Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

12:26.078 --> 12:28.038
-[giggles]
-Ow!

12:28.122 --> 12:30.040
-Hi!
-Oh, hey.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.625
-Hi!
-Hey, sweetie.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.960
-Welcome!
-Thank you.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.503
-Hi!
-Thank you.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.673
-Oh, I'm just so glad you're here.
-Thank you.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.426
Yeah. Yeah.
[giggling]

12:40.509 --> 12:43.012
[coughs, wheezes]

12:43.095 --> 12:44.305
Phlegm ball!

12:44.388 --> 12:45.931
[retches]

12:47.850 --> 12:49.727
Sorry.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.106
[both sighing]

12:54.190 --> 12:55.316
[Rebecca giggles]

12:55.399 --> 12:57.568
She's playing it so cool with him.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.236
-[continues giggling]
-Hey. Hi.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.657
Yeah, yeah.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.617
[groans]

13:04.700 --> 13:06.535
[both chuckling]

13:09.580 --> 13:12.791
[sighs]
Oh! Oh! Oh! Josh, Dad. Dad, Josh. Uh...
Can I get a picture of this moment?

13:16.170 --> 13:19.340
Of just the two most important men
in my life meeting?

13:19.423 --> 13:22.384
Just get together, get together,
get together. And one, two, three.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.761
Yay!

13:23.844 --> 13:28.224
Look at you guys, by my side,
just forever and ever.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.895
It's nice to finally meet you, sir.
Heard a lot about you.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.438
Well, it's all lies.

13:34.522 --> 13:39.193
Wow, that's a very firm handshake.
Says a lot about a man.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.112
You know, I'd love
to catch up with you later.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.740
Have a drink, you know.
You say some stuff, I say some stuff.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.159
I ask you questions, you answer them.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.744
You mean a conversation?

13:48.827 --> 13:51.413
-Yeah.
-Exactly! Yeah.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.459
-Yeah.
-Well, Silas, there you are.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.337
And where's your beautiful wife
and your ugly son?

13:58.420 --> 14:03.592
-[grunts]
-[laughing] Sorry, I forgot.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.178
You're bitterly divorced again. Aw.

14:06.262 --> 14:11.141
Dad, um, hey! I have amazing news.
Um, okay, three words...

14:11.225 --> 14:14.395
Father. Daughter. Dance.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.647
I've been thinking about it, and I was
thinking we could get a choreographer,

14:16.730 --> 14:17.815
and I have some songs in mind.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.317
Maybe an acoustic guitar version
of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,"

14:20.401 --> 14:22.319
or maybe "Kiss Me"
by Sixpence None the Richer--

14:22.403 --> 14:26.240
Excuse me! What about
my mother-daughter dance?

14:26.323 --> 14:28.117
You know how fast I pick up choreo.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.453
Anyway, Dad, what do you think?
It sounds like fun, right?

14:34.582 --> 14:37.376
I would love to, Rebecca.
Thank you for asking.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.295
Great. Paula?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.921
-Yeah.
-He said yes!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.339
Yay!

14:42.423 --> 14:44.633
[indistinct chatter]

14:44.717 --> 14:46.969
What's he doing here?
What are you doing here?

14:47.052 --> 14:50.097
Hey, Rebecca, you're looking lovely-ish.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.473
Your father invited me.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.934
I did give him a private
plane ride, remember?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.978
I do and thank you for that.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.523
I'm so glad I did that nice thing for you.
So selfless of me.

14:59.607 --> 15:04.028
It feels so good, and it makes me
like myself even better because of it.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.697
You know, I mean,
anybody can buy a guy a plane ticket,

15:06.780 --> 15:07.865
but to send a whole plane?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.367
"Hero" is not too strong a word,
I don't think.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.704
Oh, oh, Josh and my dad are talking.
Ooh, I wonder if they're talking about me.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.999
Hero! Oh, I like saying that word.
I don't know what it is,

15:17.082 --> 15:19.793
but I wear it well
and it fits me like a cape.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.795
Okay, I'm really glad
that you're somehow becoming nicer,

15:21.879 --> 15:23.505
but it's also kind of boring and-- Shh!

15:23.589 --> 15:25.925
Stop. Please stop talking.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.178
-So, you work in electronics?
-Yeah, assistant storeroom manager.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.888
Yeah, so, uh, you know,

15:30.971 --> 15:33.933
Rebecca and I were talking
about Robert the other day--

15:34.016 --> 15:38.562
-Who?
-Robert, you know, from her... past?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.898
Well, I can't say I remember him.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.736
Oh, wait. I do know that name.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.197
I think he had something to do
with that whole Harvard Law School thing.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.450
Harvard Law? No.
She went to Yale Law. Yeah.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.161
She talks about it a lot. Like, a lot.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.121
She was supposed
to have gone to Harvard Law.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.333
She got in and something happened
and she went to Yale.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.754
Anyway, that ceviche is not going to swim
its way out here. Let's go.

16:03.837 --> 16:09.093
Uh, wait. How does Robert work
into the whole Harvard-Yale thing?

16:09.176 --> 16:11.887
I have no idea.
The only reason I know that name

16:11.971 --> 16:15.015
is because I'm not supposed
to know that name.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.643
Rebecca and her mother
kept a lot of stuff from me.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.562
Now, I'm hungry, son. Want to join me?

16:20.646 --> 16:24.024
-Oh, no, thanks. Go right on ahead.
-Cheers.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.401
Cheers.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.993
-Come on. Let's go, kids. Let's go!
-Yeah!

16:34.076 --> 16:36.912
[blows whistle]
Good hustle! Let's see those free throws!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.664
You got it. You got it.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.711
Hey, man, what's up with you?
You don't seem like your normal self.

16:43.794 --> 16:48.716
[sighs] Ah, I'm okay.
I'm just thinking about my wedding.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.592
Sorry again I didn't invite you.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.886
Dude, I've known you for two weeks.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.806
Okay, fine, I'll tell you what's going on.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.183
What seems to have happened is...

16:58.267 --> 17:03.355
my fiancée has become a bit of an enigma.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.566
-That means "mystery."
-Thank you for that.

17:05.649 --> 17:09.403
[chuckles] Sorry, I don't know
what people know what words.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.780
But, you know,
it's normal to feel like this

17:11.864 --> 17:13.866
right before you get married, isn't it?

17:13.949 --> 17:14.950
Isn't it normal?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.869
What do you mean, this is not normal?

17:16.952 --> 17:20.748
Don't all brides show up to their wedding
dance rehearsal dressed like this?

17:21.915 --> 17:27.671
No, but I love it.
You two are such a handsome couple.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.090
Oh! Oh, my God. He thinks we're a couple.
That's funny. We're not a couple.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.759
But he thinks we're a couple.
We're not a couple.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.344
But that's so funny. He thinks
we're a couple. We're not a couple.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.181
-But he thinks we're a couple.
-No, no, no. I'm-I'm... I'm the dad.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.099
Oh, sorry about that.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.393
-No, it's all right. It's fine.
-Okay.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.978
Let's start moving together, huh?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.605
-Oh, okay.
-There you go.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.731
Okay.

17:45.814 --> 17:49.693
Now, use the history of your relationship
to inform the movement.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.944
Tell me,

17:51.028 --> 17:54.406
what are some of the favorite times
you've had together recently?

17:55.407 --> 17:56.867
Recent? Um...

17:57.534 --> 18:01.789
Well, we actually haven't really
seen each other in four years.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.957
Right, when he came to New York
to see<i> The Lion King.</i>

18:04.041 --> 18:07.044
-Oh, that's a great memory.
-I didn't go to <i>The Lion King.</i>

18:07.127 --> 18:10.422
He actually went with his new wife
and son. I wasn't really--

18:10.506 --> 18:11.840
I wasn't technically invited, but--

18:11.924 --> 18:15.094
but it's okay because
people on stilts frighten me.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.553
I'm so sorry about that.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.639
Tucker was going through
a really tough time.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.682
It's totally fine.
And then we got coffee afterwards.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.601
-It was such a great 20 minutes.
-Yeah.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.062
See? Dance heals.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.857
Okay, I'm gonna go
pick out a song for you.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.527
-All right.
-Mm.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.781
Oh, this is nice. I always hoped
someday we could reconnect.

18:36.698 --> 18:40.619
-You and I, adult to adult.
-Really? I've wanted that, too.

18:41.787 --> 18:46.083
Actually, there's something
I've wanted to tell you since I got here.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.962
But it's not easy to say.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.840
You can say anything you want to me, Dad.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.843
I need to borrow some cash.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.805
Sorry, what?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.731
He asked you for money
for his son's braces?

19:09.815 --> 19:14.278
I am so sorry. That is not okay.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.990
Your father is a terribly
negligent parent.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.451
He disappears from your life,
you only hear from him sporadically,

19:21.535 --> 19:23.287
and now he wants money from you?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.998
I'm very glad you called me.

19:26.081 --> 19:30.210
Look, Rebecca,
maybe some good can come from this.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.670
Maybe now you can see

19:31.753 --> 19:35.382
that your father's behavior in the past
has set a pattern for you.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.051
Seeking the love of men
who don't fully love you back.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.386
Men you have to pursue.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.598
Men who are taken
or emotionally unavailable,

19:42.681 --> 19:48.020
like your father, like Josh, like Greg,
like other men, I'm sure.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.690
Oh, Robert.

19:54.776 --> 19:55.777
-Rebecca.
-Hm?

19:55.861 --> 19:56.904
Uh...

19:58.238 --> 20:01.825
You know how much I care about you, but...

20:03.243 --> 20:05.621
I'm sorry, we can't see
each other anymore.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.956
What? What are you talking about?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.291
I'm sorry.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.003
You said that we were gonna get married
and that you were gonna leave your wife,

20:13.086 --> 20:15.422
and that's why
I went to the registrar's office today.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.966
And I dropped out of your class.
There's no conflict anymore.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.053
And then I went to a drug store
and I got this cheap veil.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.473
I tried, but I can't. I-I just can't.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.434
What? Robert... No!

20:29.186 --> 20:30.270
What just happened?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.481
-What?
-Who is Robert?

20:32.564 --> 20:35.359
You just yelled, "Robert, no!"

20:36.109 --> 20:38.528
What? No, I didn't.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.573
Yeah, you did. And you're not aware.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.992
That's called a dissociative episode.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.079
Oh, my God! Do you hear yourself?
"That's called a dissociative episode."

20:47.162 --> 20:49.373
-And that's called copying me.
-"And that's called copying me."

20:49.456 --> 20:51.708
[breathing heavily]
Wait.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.252
What if my dad leaves
before the wedding?

20:53.335 --> 20:56.588
I mean, he was kind of upset when
I didn't agree to the loan right away.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.757
He can't leave. He can't leave.
I have to make him stay.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.384
I have to find some way
to make him stay.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.844
No, no, Rebecca.
You can't make him do anything.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.222
Rebecca, wait! Please!

21:06.390 --> 21:09.643
Well, that was a good eight minutes.
We're really getting there.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.778
[humming]

21:19.861 --> 21:21.530
[gasps, chuckles]

21:21.613 --> 21:25.450
Oh, God, you startled me.
Poppin' up out of nowhere.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.660
[chuckles]

21:26.743 --> 21:28.412
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.957
Hey, Naomi, who's Robert?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.752
-What did you just say?
-Well, Rebecca mentioned a Robert--

21:35.836 --> 21:36.837
Robert.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.341
He was our dog.
I named him after Redford.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.677
Rebecca loved him.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.723
And then he got those lumps that dogs
sometimes get and-- [inhales sharply]

21:47.806 --> 21:53.812
Curtains. I would not mention him
to Rebecca. Makes her upset.

21:53.895 --> 21:57.274
Okay, but what does that have
to do with Harvard Law School?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.151
What has gotten into you today?

21:59.234 --> 22:00.527
-I just--
-Josh...

22:00.610 --> 22:03.030
Rebecca does not need this right now.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.865
She's madly in love with you.

22:04.948 --> 22:10.620
And the one thing that she does not need
is an indecisive kid with the jitters.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
So, forget it.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.625
Apology accepted.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.919
[knocking on door]

22:18.670 --> 22:22.674
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm barging in. I'm sorry. Um...

22:22.758 --> 22:25.594
I just got back from the drugstore,
and I have to tell you something.

22:25.677 --> 22:30.807
So, here are 14 Father's Day cards,
from all of the ones that I missed.

22:30.891 --> 22:36.480
Chocolates, shaving kit,
a "Number One Dad" mug, huh? Um...

22:38.273 --> 22:40.650
I'm sorry that I am the way I am. Okay?

22:40.734 --> 22:44.279
I'm sorry that I was a needy kid
who pressured you and drove you away.

22:44.362 --> 22:48.658
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of it.
So, here is a check for Tucker.

It doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter.

All that matters
is that I want you in my life.

about going, please don't go.

Honey, of course, I'll stay.
Of course, I'll walk you down the aisle.

23:14.309 --> 23:18.605

They... They really mean a lot.

-Sit, sit.
-Rebecca, grab my... grab my hands.

36:33.900 --> 36:34.942
All right, just breathe.

36:35.026 --> 36:40.156
[overlapping chatter]

36:40.239 --> 36:45.244
[voices fading out]

36:45.328 --> 36:48.664
-[screams]
-Wait!

36:53.920 --> 36:56.297
Rebecca, stop!

36:57.715 --> 36:58.716
Where are you go--?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.510
Hey. Hey.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.387
Stop!

37:07.683 --> 37:11.479
I guess Josh isn't marrying
this girl, either.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.814
One hundred percent not.

37:16.901 --> 37:20.863
Rebecca! Rebecca! Wait!

37:21.864 --> 37:23.074
Cookie, stop!

37:27.161 --> 37:31.123
Stop! Okay, honey, okay.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.709
Look, I'm... I'm right here, honey.
Just turn around.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.504
Just step back, okay?

37:39.924 --> 37:41.884
Why do they all leave?

37:44.595 --> 37:47.098
Every man I've ever loved, they leave.

37:48.557 --> 37:51.560
Josh... my father...

37:53.980 --> 37:55.064
Greg...

37:57.275 --> 37:58.150
Robert!

37:59.277 --> 38:02.071
Who the dickens is Robert?

38:03.072 --> 38:04.532
Okay. Okay, you know what?

38:04.615 --> 38:07.118
Let's just-- Let's sit down
and let's talk about it.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.496
No, no, no!
Don't come close to me, okay?

38:10.579 --> 38:13.499
Just nobody--
Just don't take one step closer.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.088
Honey, are you okay?
[voice echoing]

38:19.171 --> 38:23.175
What's going on? Look at me. Come on.
Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.260
What's happening? Rebecca!

38:24.343 --> 38:26.095
[Rebecca]
<i>They all leave.</i>

38:26.178 --> 38:28.389
[Heather]
<i>Who the dickens is Robert?</i>

38:28.472 --> 38:31.058
What? Robert, no! No!

38:31.142 --> 38:33.019
No, no! No, no, no!

38:33.102 --> 38:35.479
Robert, Robert! No, you can't leave me.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.649
You can't leave me. We're meant to be.
I love you. I love you.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.987
-It's over. Let yourself out.
-Robert! Hey, no. Robert!

39:00.755 --> 39:02.423
[man]
<i>And three counts of attempted arson.</i>

39:03.424 --> 39:05.426
Your Honor, she's just a girl in love.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.428
She can't be held responsible
for her actions.

39:07.511 --> 39:11.557
I am granting Professor Donnelly's
request for a restraining order.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.685
-No, but I'm going to Harvard Law.
-Not anymore.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.563
Furthermore, I will strike the conviction
from your record,

39:17.646 --> 39:20.816
only if you agree to get appropriate
mental help, Miss Bunch.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.570
But I don't need help.
I have no underlying issues to address.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.948
What's with this one?

39:28.032 --> 39:31.160
She sings to herself all day.
No one knows why.

39:49.678 --> 39:55.643
Oh, no, no, no!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

39:58.729 --> 40:02.525
It's my fault.
It's my fault they don't love me.

40:02.608 --> 40:05.069
No, no, no. Stop.
Stop it. You hear me?

40:06.028 --> 40:08.697
This is not your fault.
You have done nothing wrong.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.324
Josh is the one to blame.

40:10.408 --> 40:16.330
All these men, they are the ones to blame,
including Robert, whoever that is.

40:16.414 --> 40:21.460
And starting with your garbage father
who left you.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.760
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of this.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.305
I don't need to stand around
and be insulted. I'm out of here.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.850
Good!

40:37.852 --> 40:41.730
Good. You should go.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.150
Go.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.404
Just take your check and get out of here.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.825
I never want to see you again.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.660
Fine.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.705
You're crazy. Little bit.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.004
Where's your plane?

41:05.087 --> 41:08.799
[scoffs] Oh, yeah, right.
Have fun flying coach, dick.

41:15.347 --> 41:20.895
Listen, we are gonna make Josh pay,
I promise you. I will help you.

41:20.978 --> 41:24.231
We'll TP his house, we'll hack
his Facebook, we'll key his car.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.817
No, no, no,
we can't do any of those things.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.110
Why not?

41:29.570 --> 41:31.071
Because they're not enough.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.702
Because Josh Chan must be destroyed.
