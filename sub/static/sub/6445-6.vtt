WEBVTT

00:12.513 --> 00:13.753
Come on, tippytoes.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.926
What you got?
You gotta learn how to tango, baby.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.430
Good-looking brother ﬂying in.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.062
Yeah, baby.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.205
And that's game.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.339
Guess you won't be
dancing with the stars.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.139
Time to pony up, Yance.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.096
Think I'm paying you, man? You crazy.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.978
-Dog, you set the table, I cleaned up.
-Tomorrow night.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.389
Best two out of three.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.309
-Can't do it. Gotta study.
-You know you gotta square me up.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.647
Look, I got a test, man. I can't—

01:28.964 --> 01:30.170
Hey, what was that?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.008
No way, man. Don't go back there.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.676
Don't you ever watch movies?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.851
Check it out.

02:28.357 --> 02:31.849
Yo, that was some creepy creepy, man.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.185
"That was some creepy creepy, man."

02:38.784 --> 02:41.742
-Where is Kai-El?
-What "El"?

02:41.912 --> 02:43.573
I said...

02:44.039 --> 02:45.700
...where is Kal-El?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.327
What you going on about, man?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.538
What's a "Cow-El"?

04:21.845 --> 04:26.259
Middle of the night, mysterious meeting,
suspicious briefcase.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.925
You normallyjust call me with an update,
Dr. Groll. Why all the intrigue?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.970
The precautions
aren't for dramatic effect.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.809
Are you in some sort of danger?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.598
I think we both are.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.897
These CDs contain
all my research on the box.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.154
Every test result,
every theory I've written.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.316
-You're quitting?
-l'm disappearing.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.359
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

04:50.248 --> 04:53.456
You'll ﬁnd that when you're in
as deep as we are with the Luthors...

04:53.627 --> 04:55.288
...they won't let you walk away.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.455
We've started military testing.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.798
I thought we were
still in the analysis phase.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.846
Lex didn't tell me that we were
testing with the military.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.384
Forgive me. I believe that there's
a lot that Lex neglects to tell you.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.313
You could have just left.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.980
Why come to me?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.642
Because I'm not the only one
I'm worried about.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.188
Despite our differences, Miss Lang,
I thought you deserved a warning.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.775
I'm getting as far away from the Luthors
as possible.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.534
| suggest you do the same.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.306
"Oakland, California"?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.062
Authorities determined it was made
by a shooting star...

05:58.233 --> 06:00.770
...but that was just wishful thinking.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.394
Sorry. It impacted six weeks ago.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.813
Around the time you fell out
of the Phantom Zone.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.733
It gets worse. He's already killed once.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.242
Two boys went missing
on the site of the crater...

06:11.413 --> 06:15.156
...and all they found
were human ashes and a basketball.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.242
It sounds like heat vision.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.584
Not unless your heat vision
comes with a radiation setting.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.465
The ashes were off the Geiger charts,
and the next day...

06:25.635 --> 06:28.718
...the nuclear facilities
20 miles away were hit.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.629
Any idea why the Zoner would be there?

06:30.807 --> 06:35.392
Well, aside from giving the ﬁve researchers
a premature cremation...

06:35.562 --> 06:38.975
...the radioactive material that they'd
been working with was sucked dry.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.690
It's almost like he was feeding off it.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.101
We need to check the plants in the area.

06:45.655 --> 06:50.399
Hello. Have you met me?
There have been a half a dozen incidents...

06:50.577 --> 06:54.661
...across the continent. The most recent one
was just outside Metropolis.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.496
Chloe, these attacks form a straight line.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.457
Headed directly towards you.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.957
-Chloe--
-l'|l make a list of possible sites...

07:07.135 --> 07:10.502
-...within a hundred-mile radius. I'll call you.
-Thanks.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.610
Raya.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.865
Hello, Kal-El.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.668
l was afraid I'd never see you again.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.056
-l'm sorry. I didn't wanna leave you.
-You had no choice.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.308
It's okay, Kal-El.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.062
And if it wasn't for you,
I would have never escaped.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.019
I would have never seen all this.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.856
It's more beautiful than the world
your father described.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.899
How'd you ﬁnd me?

08:11.074 --> 08:15.158
Your father told me about the family
he had chosen for you...

08:15.328 --> 08:17.410
...about Smallville.

08:17.581 --> 08:21.039
It must have been hard
growing up here by yourself.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.870
I had my parents. I had my friends.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.914
But no one who really understood you.

08:31.803 --> 08:35.091
You mean, what was it like to grow up
with such a big secret?

08:35.682 --> 08:40.051
And the amazing rush of racing trains...

08:40.228 --> 08:42.890
...knowing nothing can hurt you.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.433
| used to try to pretend not to notice.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.024
But sometimes I would catch my dad
watching me...

08:51.198 --> 08:54.861
...when I'd pick something up
that was impossible for him to even move.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.738
He wanted so much to know
what that felt like.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.203
But he never could.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.290
No matter howl think I ﬁt in...

09:05.629 --> 09:08.291
...every day I'm reminded
I'm not one of them.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.210
You're not alone anymore.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.458
I'm here.

09:20.143 --> 09:24.102
Hey, the wayward boyfriend returns.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.182
Jimmy, we're in the bullpen,
not the back of my Yaris.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.647
Which I am looking forward
to visiting again soon.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.948
But ﬁrst, you need a swanky new dress.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.697
Gotta look sharp when we're accepting
our Pulitzer.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.360
Your words, my pictures.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.489
Think I should rent a tux?
Is that too stuffy?

09:43.667 --> 09:47.751
Jimmy, I would hold off on the bow tie.
This is a bumper.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.334
Yeah, but watch. This guy
takes a metal briefcase into the car...

09:51.508 --> 09:52.668
...and leaves without it.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.050
-What were they doing out there?
-l'm working on it.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.303
Well, who is this mystery man?

10:00.475 --> 10:02.807
I don't know.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.018
What's in the briefcase?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.352
Something illegal?

10:10.527 --> 10:13.519
Jimmy, this isn't a story, it's a hunch.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.653
What were you doing
playing stalkerazzi...

10:15.824 --> 10:18.531
...in the middle of the night,
following Lex Luthor around?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.318
Being proactive.
Hopefully, nailing a front-page shot.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.992
Don't think a
back-alley handoff is suspicious?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.782
I think Lex Luthor
getting out of bed is suspicious...

10:27.961 --> 10:30.748
...but you need facts. You need proof.

10:31.381 --> 10:35.374
Well, thanks for the pop-up commentary,
but that's where l was...

10:35.552 --> 10:37.417
...kind of hoping you would come in.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.881
Look, Jimmy,
I've dealt with the Luthors before...

10:40.056 --> 10:42.798
...and the kind of ball they play
is very, very hard.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.598
Then I guess I better bring my bat.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.394
Appreciate the help.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.231
Jimmy.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.700
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.405
Serious lack of signage down here.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.746
-Which way is Archives?
-lt's over there.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.828
Are you one of the new...

11:13.006 --> 11:14.962
...intems?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.663
Kal-El.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.965
What do you mean,
Groll's lab is cleaned out?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.802
This schematic can't be all that's left.
What about all the research?

12:07.310 --> 12:09.266
Just ﬁnd him.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.069
Mr. Luthor, thanks for seeing me.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.191
Your girlfriend is very close
with the person I care most about.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.485
That's the only reason you're here,
Mr. Olsen.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.572
Would you mind if I start with pictures?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.161
Actually, I do.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.622
I'll have my people send you
a publicity shot.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.385
Right.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.885
So, what is this about?

12:44.264 --> 12:48.132
Okay, then, down to business.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.765
What is your connection to this man,
Mr. Luthor?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.851
What was in the steel case he gave you?

13:17.714 --> 13:20.251
So can I take that as a "no comment"?

13:33.938 --> 13:39.729
You know, James, I was very happy to hear
that Chloe ﬁnally landed a boyfriend.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.277
It appears myjubilation was premature.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.695
Mr. Olsen has to get back to Metropolis.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.414
Make sure he ﬁnds the way out.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.833
Jimmy.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.293
Tell Chloe, Lana says hello.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.425
And if you ever try anything
like this again...

14:06.596 --> 14:10.214
...you'll be leaving through the window,
no matter who you're dating.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.028
I thought I should
just give you the car...

14:33.206 --> 14:36.790
...since you obviously don't like asking
to borrow it.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.201
I didn't know that I had to.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.122
Lana, the car is not a big deal.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.382
You sneaking out of the house
at midnight?

14:48.972 --> 14:50.963
That bothers me.

14:52.850 --> 14:57.560
There's nothing to be upset about, Lex.
I had a late-night craving for ice cream.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.643
Mocha mint?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.562
That's your favorite, right?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.273
What's Dr. Groll's?

15:12.495 --> 15:15.908
Did you honestly think
this wouldn't catch up with you?

15:17.917 --> 15:21.000
I don't like playing
cat-and-mouse games, Lana.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.834
Is it the game that you don't like...

15:26.593 --> 15:29.505
...or the fact that someone's playing it
on your level?

15:29.846 --> 15:34.055
I don't know where you stashed the box,
but I want it back. Now.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.009
Please.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.535
You cheated.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.448
I couldn't let a rookie catch me
in the last county.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.913
Jor-El would have never let you
get away with that.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.715
What was he like?

16:17.935 --> 16:18.970
My father.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.554
Brave. Strong.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.940
With the biggest heart
of anyone I've ever known.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.728
To be honest,
that's not the Jor-El I imagined.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.989
He was determined to save us.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.360
I remember helping him build your ship.

16:36.537 --> 16:41.998
He was so careful. Planning every detail,
down to your baby blanket.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.462
| wish they could see you now.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.545
I haven't been the best son.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.796
Your father was hard on himself too.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.056
He felt guilty
that he couldn't save Krypton.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.185
His only redemption
was sending you to save Earth.

17:04.607 --> 17:05.847
Save it from what?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.936
Extinction.

17:08.111 --> 17:12.696
Your civilization is going to destroy itself,
just like Krypton.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.115
You should know this.
It was part of your training.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.986
I haven't started my training.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.159
And now the Fortress is damaged.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.083
Jor-El tried to warn me.
I didn't listen.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.795
How could I trust someone
who brought pain into my life?

17:32.969 --> 17:37.633
Pain is a part of anyone's journey, Kal-El.
You can't escape it.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.549
You must accept your destiny.

17:42.937 --> 17:46.179
Too bad that destiny's
just gotten a little shorter.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.729
The last son of Krypton.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.984
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.245
You're the one who's been
coming for me.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.249
And I think it will be worth the trip.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.961
What's the matter, Raya...

18:10.757 --> 18:12.338
...don't recognize an old friend?

18:14.552 --> 18:17.919
It's me, Baern.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.429
He's one of the Phantoms.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.929
How do you like the new suit?

18:24.854 --> 18:27.812
-What do you want?
-To pay back your old man...

18:27.982 --> 18:30.018
...for giving me a one-way ticket to hell.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.354
But then he had to get himself
eviscerated...

18:32.528 --> 18:35.736
...along with everyone else
from that ice cube you call a planet.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.986
So I guess you'll have to do.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.225
Kal-EI?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.477
Where is he?

19:23.496 --> 19:27.239
I know my father told you where
he sent me, but how did Baern know?

19:29.752 --> 19:33.836
After Krypton fell and Jor-El was dead,
the prisoners in the Phantom Zone...

19:34.006 --> 19:37.089
...discovered that he'd only managed
to save his own son.

19:37.260 --> 19:41.549
The story of your survival was a myth,
a rumor.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.715
One of hope for some of us,
and revenge for others.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.680
For someone who's been dreaming
of killing me for 20 years...

19:48.855 --> 19:50.186
...his visit was short-lived.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.393
I don't think he was expecting
to ﬁght both of us.

19:53.568 --> 19:57.186
He was weakening.
His race feeds off radioactive energy.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.773
So that's why he's so strong.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.988
Baern killed hundreds on his own planet
before he came to Krypton.

20:04.161 --> 20:07.198
But Jor-El managed to exile him
to the Phantom Zone.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.329
Baern is searching
for a new energy source.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.458
It won't take him long.
He can sense power sources.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.244
There's only one thing that can stop him:

20:16.299 --> 20:17.880
Your father's crystal.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.304
Hey.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.311
I've sent you, like, 10 text messages.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.392
Really? I must have missed it.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.478
Look, I'm sorry.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.984
I shouldn't have blown off
your conspiracy theory.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.693
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew what a shark Lex is.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.698
I know, you're right.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.992
So you're dropping it?

20:47.163 --> 20:50.075
No, I meant that you were right
that I needed proof.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.238
So I pulled a little:

20:51.417 --> 20:54.534
"How about free publicity for your charity?"
with Luthor the Lesser.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.998
I got my foot in the door
and took a look around.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.505
Wow, you must have been
pretty persuasive.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.666
Lex doesn't usually take interviews.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.509
Yeah.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.137
Actually, I may have dropped your name.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.511
Look, I'm sorry, but I had to.
It was so worth it. Take a look.

21:16.651 --> 21:17.811
Oh, my God.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.267
You see those symbols?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.311
They're like hieroglyphics.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.028
Do you know what this means, Chloe?

21:28.037 --> 21:31.120
Lexis working with the Egyptians.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.919
You know, I think you're right.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.379
Why don't you make copies? And I'll call
the embassy and see what I can dig up.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.635
Hey, now, that is my girl.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.719
Baern wouldn't have left the area
with you still alive.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.852
There must be some other place he'd go.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.514
A military installation
the public doesn't know about?

21:58.693 --> 22:01.651
Hey, I've been trying to call you.
Where have you been?

22:01.821 --> 22:02.901
Racing around.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.564
Chloe, this is Raya.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.702
Oh, Raya. wow.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.784
It's nice to know something good
came out of the Phantom Zone...

22:14.959 --> 22:16.915
...especially since
we have a big problem.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.336
This is what Zod was gonna use
to wipe out the Earth.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.296
-Where'd you get this?
-Jimmy took it.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.335
It was on Lex's desk.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.010
-I thought I destroyed it.
-I know this design.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.596
It's part of
the Brain InterActive Construct.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.431
-The what?
-Brainiac.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.311
This box is its power core...

22:38.482 --> 22:42.100
...a Kryptonian energy source exponentially
stronger than anything on Earth.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.688
Baern.

22:44.238 --> 22:49.107
If he gets ahold of this, it'll give him
enough power to fuel him indeﬁnitely...

22:49.535 --> 22:51.947
...and kill us both.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.924
Safe and sound.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.309
You didn't keep it.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.139
It's not mine to keep.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.726
Incredible, isn't it?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.816
Such a small, fragmented
piece of metal...

23:27.990 --> 23:29.946
...might hold the secrets of the universe.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.280
Or a new way to destroy ourselves.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.993
Lex, you didn't tell me
you started working with the military.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.910
Well, who better to help defend us?

23:42.963 --> 23:46.672
Lana, the future always has risks.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.833
That doesn't mean
we shouldn't move fonNard.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.472
I thought we were in this together.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.342
We still are.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.353
Just not on the same side.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.646
Lex, you're obsessed.

24:06.028 --> 24:09.441
We've been through this before
with the ship and something has gotta give.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.733
The box...

24:13.911 --> 24:15.151
...or me?

24:28.217 --> 24:31.050
-You have something I need.
-Lana, call security.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.711
They're kind of unavailable right now.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.354
You're not getting near it.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.605
Lex!

25:15.598 --> 25:16.587
Lex.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.850
It's only a second-degree burn.
Nothing to worry about.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.637
They wanna run an x-ray,
make sure my ribs are all right.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.101
How did that thing know about the box?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.731
That's exactly what I was wondering.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.699
Do you think that I'd actually be involved
in something like this?

25:37.870 --> 25:39.406
That I'd let you get hurt?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.369
No.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.788
Of course not.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.467
Clark.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.128
What are you doing here?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.465
I went by the mansion.
I heard you were taken to the hospital.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.550
You okay?

25:59.725 --> 26:03.684
We're ﬁne, Clark. Both of us.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.477
-What happened?
-We had an uninvited guest.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.940
But we're used to that kind of thing.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.316
I'm glad you're all right, then.

26:22.790 --> 26:25.281
Mr. Luthor, let's get you down to X-ray.

26:35.761 --> 26:40.846
Hate to question your good-natured visit,
but are you really interested in Lex's health?

26:41.016 --> 26:44.179
-What's the real reason?
-You don't wanna get in the middle.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.561
No, you don't want me in the middle of it,
but it's too late.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.978
Clark, stop trying to think up excuses
and just tell me what's going on.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.900
Have you seen this before?

27:05.374 --> 27:06.910
Yes.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.959
But it doesn't matter anymore.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.212
It's just a pile of ash now.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.128
That thing destroyed it.

27:23.851 --> 27:27.389
Raya, I told you the Fortress is dead.
Why are we here?

27:27.563 --> 27:30.396
It's our only hope to defeat Baern.

27:38.741 --> 27:42.108
This was all we had left of our home,
Kal-EI.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.034
And now it's gone too.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.201
It was more than that.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.419
The Fortress was a storehouse
for all the knowledge in the universe.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.463
At least, all that we had.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.720
How could this happen?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.015
I'm
sorry

28:09.772 --> 28:11.603
I don't know how to bring it back.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.099
Your father wouldn't have given up
so easily.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.727
I haven't given up.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.021
I don't know what to do.
I've tried everything.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.863
Everything except the training
your father wanted for you.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.455
So why are we here?

28:32.669 --> 28:35.251
Baern is too dangerous to attack
anywhere else.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.131
With the power he absorbed from the box,
he could wipe out half a continent.

28:39.301 --> 28:42.134
-If he's that strong, will the crystal work?
-It should.

28:42.304 --> 28:45.467
Provided we stay alive long enough
to use it.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.637
I'm not sure it'll be that easy
to lure him here.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.303
I'm gonna see if I can reroute
whatever power is left.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.063
Just enough to send out a signal...

28:56.318 --> 28:58.650
...to let Baern know you're here.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.942
Clark, I'm home.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.612
I canceled the rest of my meetings
and came back early.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.823
If I had to listen to one more egoist
droning on about the need...

29:08.997 --> 29:12.990
...for school reform rather than
actually doing something about it....

29:17.339 --> 29:18.328
Clark?

29:18.507 --> 29:20.463
Don't you mean "Kai-El"?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.546
He left without saying goodbye.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.170
Who are you?

29:27.182 --> 29:28.217
Where's Clark?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.804
That's what I would like to know.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.570
Kal-El.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.165
That's all the power I was able to draw.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.881
-Hopefully, it'll be enough.
-That sound, I've heard it before.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.637
Every Kryptonian family
has a unique tone...

30:09.808 --> 30:12.800
...a beacon to identify itself.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.394
Baern's sure to recognize yours.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.347
And follow it straight to me.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.767
So this is Jor-El's famed
Fortress of Knowledge.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.442
I thought it'd be bigger.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.904
It doesn't matter.
You won't be staying long.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.909
Big talk, big man.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.332
I'm surprised you're still standing.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.459
Jor-El was right about how the yellow sun
affects you Kryptonian cockroaches.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.413
But I'm back. And now...

30:43.425 --> 30:44.881
...l'm super-sized.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.760
This is the perfect place
for the fall of the House of El.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.473
Paying for the sins of your father
can be a bitch.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.271
Raya?

31:53.328 --> 31:54.488
Raya.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.742
The crystal...

31:58.083 --> 31:59.869
...it has enough power now.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.252
Restore the Fortress.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.010
You can't leave me. Not now.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.433
I'm
sorry

32:24.026 --> 32:29.316
...I couldn't share in your destiny, Kal-El.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.809
What happened?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.057
I mean, where am I?

33:05.317 --> 33:06.898
Hospital...

33:07.235 --> 33:08.896
...in Kansas.

33:10.739 --> 33:11.899
Kansas?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.281
You have any idea how you got here?

33:18.955 --> 33:21.367
I barely even know where here is.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.793
I mean, no ball, no beach.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.665
Kansas is strictly ﬁy-over.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.168
-So the last six weeks...?
-Six weeks?

33:35.138 --> 33:39.222
I mean, the last thing I remember was....

33:39.893 --> 33:42.976
Okay, I was playing ball
with my boy, Yance.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.228
And after that...

33:49.820 --> 33:51.230
...nothing.

33:58.787 --> 33:59.947
Am I supposed to know you?

34:01.790 --> 34:03.246
No.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.999
My name's Clark Kent.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.786
We found you unconscious and....

34:11.925 --> 34:14.632
I didn't know what else to do,
so I brought you here.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.804
This is crazy.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.303
Yeah.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.103
The doctors say you're gonna be all right.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.821
I get the feeling I've got you
to thank for that.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.488
Kansas, huh?

34:48.211 --> 34:49.826
Kansas.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.846
Oh, no. I know that look. Meeting
didn't go well with the editor, huh?

35:05.020 --> 35:08.353
Some meeting. I pitched my take
on the Lex Luthor-Egyptians conspiracy.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.230
They refused to put somebody on the story,
and I had proof.

35:11.401 --> 35:15.861
Well, maybe not deﬁnitive proof,
but you deﬁnitely were onto something.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.113
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.739
That's not even the worst of it.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.777
Well, you couldn't have been demoted.
You can't get any lower.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.702
Try unemployment.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.747
Apparently, Lex made a call.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.328
-They ﬁred me.
-What?

35:29.503 --> 35:34.463
Look, I managed to talk my way back,
but only as far as the basement.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.882
Well, don't knock the basement.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.553
My career's over. I'll be scanning
other people's photos...

35:45.727 --> 35:48.969
-...into the archive for the rest of my life.
-No, you won't.

35:49.147 --> 35:53.060
In fact, you should consider the fact
that Lex tried to get you ﬁred a compliment.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.066
If you hadn't been so good at yourjob--

35:55.237 --> 35:57.603
Too good.
--he wouldn't have even bothered.

35:59.533 --> 36:03.617
You're gonna be a great photographer
one day, Jimmy Olsen.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.457
I thought maybe you'd had
another sweet-tooth attack.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.090
Don't worry, Lex.
I'm not going anywhere.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.168
You sure?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.967
Not tonight.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.679
I think we need to reassess some things.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.145
-Because of the box?
-Because you lied to me, Lana.

36:36.653 --> 36:39.190
After all your talk about honesty....

36:39.823 --> 36:41.438
Then I guess we're even.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.155
I'm just glad that the box was destroyed.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.699
How can you say that?

36:51.459 --> 36:55.452
You've seen what can happen,
the threats that are out there.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.872
The box was our only hope
at defending ourselves.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.217
The human race has survived this long.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.879
It doesn't need Lex Luthor to save it.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.811
You know, our conversation
was interrupted.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.648
Don't you mean "your ultimatum"?

37:21.698 --> 37:25.361
Do you honestly think
I wouldn't have chosen you?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.333
I guess we'll never know.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.017
Raya sounds like an amazing woman.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.270
I wish you could have met her.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.898
She loved this place, this whole world.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.269
She barely had enough time
to discover it...

38:02.489 --> 38:05.481
...before she gave her life to protect it.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.530
It looks like Krypton gave us
more than one hero.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.783
I'm so sorry, Clark.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.075
When I was with Raya...

38:17.712 --> 38:19.543
...I didn't feel alone anymore.

38:20.674 --> 38:23.211
-Clark—
-Mom, I know how much you love me.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.501
And how much Dad....

38:29.057 --> 38:32.049
But I've always felt different.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.308
It's because I am.

38:35.271 --> 38:39.355
And Raya was the ﬁrst person I ever met
who could really understand that.

38:40.610 --> 38:44.148
And I don't think I ever really
thought about what I had lost:

38:44.823 --> 38:48.156
A family, a whole race of people
who were just like me.

38:51.162 --> 38:56.907
For the ﬁrst time, I'm ready to stop running
from who I really am.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.584
From my destiny.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.918
Your training with Jor-El...

39:08.263 --> 39:09.503
...you wanna go.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.427
But I can't.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.349
Not yet.

39:16.271 --> 39:20.640
Not until every prisoner that I released
from the Phantom Zone is returned...

39:21.443 --> 39:23.354
...or destroyed.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.578
