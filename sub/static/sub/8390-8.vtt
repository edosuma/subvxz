WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.159
- YOU KNOW WHAT, CROSBY,
HOWEVER HARD YOU THINK IT IS

00:03.210 --> 00:04.472
HAVING A KID,
JUST DOUBLE IT.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.545
- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU HAD
A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE

00:06.590 --> 00:08.729
WHILE LEAVING OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD
SON ALONE IN THE POOL.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.819
- CAN WE JUST REWIND
AND FORGET

00:10.870 --> 00:12.201
ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION?
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:12.250 --> 00:13.558
ACTUALLY,
YOU JUST NEED TO GO, OKAY?

00:13.590 --> 00:14.830
- BERKELEY IS
A LIVING HELL, MOM.

00:14.870 --> 00:15.837
I AM NOT MOVING THERE.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.838
I AM MOVING IN
WITH DAMIEN.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.077
WE HAVE DECIDED.
- [shouts]

00:20.120 --> 00:21.109
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO ME?

00:21.150 --> 00:22.424
YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE.

00:22.470 --> 00:25.109
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DROVE
ALL THE WAY FROM FRESNO.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.194
- OH.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.118
- SHE BOUNCES THE BALL
BEHIND MY BACK

00:31.160 --> 00:32.366
DURING STORY TIME.

00:32.410 --> 00:34.674
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.
- SHE DISRUPTS THE CLASS.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.859
USES THE BALL
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HERSELF.

00:36.890 --> 00:39.063
- I'M SURPRISED.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.853
- I WAS TOO.
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH THIS BALL.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.276
I'M PRETI'Y SURE SHE TOOK

00:43.310 --> 00:45.551
A BOX OF RUBBER BANDS
OUT OF MY DESK DRAWER.

00:45.590 --> 00:46.864
- WHEN WOULD SHE HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT?

00:46.900 --> 00:48.379
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.591
- IS SHE EVER LEFI'
IN THE ROOM ALONE?

00:49.630 --> 00:51.143
- NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.249
- THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY EVIDENCE

00:52.290 --> 00:53.598
THAT SHE COULD DO THAT.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.143
- NO, I'M NOT CERTAIN.

00:55.190 --> 00:57.158
I WAS GOING TO LET IT
RUN ITS COURSE,

00:57.190 --> 00:58.873
BUT WHEN IT BECAME
A DANGER...

00:58.920 --> 01:00.842
- WAIT. YOU MEAN A DANGER--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:00.880 --> 01:04.884
- SHE HIT LI'I'I'LE JADEN KRANTZ
IN THE HEAD WITH THAT BALL.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.194
- ON PURPOSE?
- IS HE OKAY?

01:06.230 --> 01:07.401
- HE IS OKAY.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.125
AND I DON'T THINK SHE DID IT
ON PURPOSE.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.888
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN AIMING
AT ME.

01:11.930 --> 01:14.376
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHY I HAD TO TAKE

01:14.410 --> 01:17.106
THE BALL AWAY
AND CALL YOU IN.

01:17.140 --> 01:20.200
- SURE.
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.172
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:24.490 --> 01:25.559
- I CAN TAKE THIS,
RIGHT?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.830
- SURE.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.359
- MY DOCTOR SAYS,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.119
"YOU CAN'T HAVE A GARLIC KNOT."
I MEAN...

01:31.160 --> 01:32.013
- REALLY?
- FROM MAMA LUCIA'S?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.915
- YOUR--NO, NOT RIGHT NOW,
THANK YOU.

01:33.950 --> 01:37.124
- WHOO. IS SHE NEW?
- YOU'VE MET JENNY BEFORE.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.572
- OH, IS SHE GORDON'S ASSISTANT?
HEY, WHERE'S GORDON?

01:39.610 --> 01:41.578
- LOOK, IF THE DOCTOR'S TELLING
YOU NOT TO HAVE GARLIC KNOTS,

01:41.610 --> 01:42.577
DON'T HAVE THE GARLIC KNOTS.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.646
- OKAY, I WON'T.
- [sighs]

01:44.690 --> 01:45.645
ALL RIGHT, JUST TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, WOULD YOU?

01:45.690 --> 01:46.714
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

01:46.760 --> 01:48.204
- THERE'S
THIS INVESTMENT PROPERTY

01:48.240 --> 01:49.855
THAT I WANT YOU TO SEE.
- UH-HUH.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.551
- AND IN THIS CLIMATE, IT'D BE
AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.579
BEFORE I DO ANYTHING WITH IT,

01:53.630 --> 01:54.892
I WANT TO GET
YOUR OPINION.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.215
- MY OPINION?
WHY?

01:57.250 --> 01:58.558
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:58.600 --> 02:02.252
REAL ESTATE/ BUSINESS ACUMEN,
SON.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.803
- ACUMEN?
- YEAH.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.149
WE'D HAVE TO DRIVE THERE,
STAY OVERNIGHT.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.259
- COME ON, DAD.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.325
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO STAY
OVERNIGHT SOMEWHERE.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.361
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

02:09.400 --> 02:10.844
- IT'D BE LIKE FATHER
AND SON TIME, YOU KNOW.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.222
WE COULD GET A CHANCE
TO TALK, ADAM.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.294
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
OF THAT.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.228
- I'LL CALL KRISTINA.

02:15.270 --> 02:17.158
I'LL JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S CLEAR WITH HER, OKAY?

02:17.200 --> 02:17.882
- THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO HEAR.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.238
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.373
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SORRY.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:20.410 --> 02:21.718
- YOU WANT SOME GARLIC KNOTS?

02:21.760 --> 02:22.966
- WHY DON'T I TAKE THOSE
FROM YOU?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.480
- NO. I'LL HAVE
AS MANY GARLIC KNOTS AS I WANT.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.171
- YOUR REAL ESTATE ACUMEN?

02:28.210 --> 02:29.552
HE USED THE WORD "ACUMEN"?

02:29.590 --> 02:31.239
- YUP.
- THAT'S WORRISOME.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.907
- YEAH, I WAS WONDERING
IF HE WANTED ME

02:32.940 --> 02:34.487
TO GO IN ON A PIECE OF,
I DON'T KNOW,

02:34.530 --> 02:35.929
VACATION REAL ESTATE
WITH HIM OR SOMETHING.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.904
THEN HE TRIED TO SELL IT TO ME
AS FATHER AND SON TIME.

02:38.950 --> 02:39.939
- YIKES.

02:39.980 --> 02:42.608
HEY, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I BROUGHT SOMETHING OVER

02:42.640 --> 02:43.800
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.

02:43.850 --> 02:46.569
- YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?

02:46.610 --> 02:48.646
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

02:48.680 --> 02:49.988
- THAT'S GREAT?
- YEAH.

02:50.030 --> 02:51.850
- YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD
TO RECEIVE AN INVITATION

02:51.890 --> 02:53.266
TO YOUR SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
IN THE MAIL?

02:53.310 --> 02:55.198
- YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU GOT INVITED AT ALL.

02:55.240 --> 02:55.922
- HEY,
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.404
- THERE ARE NO SIDES HERE.

02:57.450 --> 02:59.202
YOU JUST GOT TO PAY ATTENTION
TO YOUR KID.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.616
- YEAH, LISTEN,
I'VE BEEN SPENDING

03:00.660 --> 03:01.888
A LOT OF TIME
WITH JABBAR, OKAY?

03:01.940 --> 03:03.999
HE KNOWS ME PRE'ITY WELL NOW,
AND HE'S SMART,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.621
SO IF I DON'T PLAN THIS PARTY,

03:05.660 --> 03:06.649
HE'S GONNA SENSE THAT.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.792
GREAT CHAIR.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.932
- YOU LIKE THIS?
- YEAH, HIGH QUALITY.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.242
- [groans]

03:10.290 --> 03:11.621
LOOK,
IF YOU WANT TO BE THERE,

03:11.670 --> 03:12.944
JUST, YOU KNOW,
GIVE JASMINE A CALL

03:12.980 --> 03:14.424
AND TELL HER
YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.563
- SHE'S JUST SENDING
A LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.942
IT'S, LIKE, HALF THE TIME
SHE WANTS ME TO BE THE DAD,

03:18.990 --> 03:21.015
AND THEN THE OTHER HALF,
SHE'S KEEPING ME ON THE OUTSIDE.

03:21.060 --> 03:24.575
I JUST WISH SHE WOULD PICK
A PATH AND STICK TO IT.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.020
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD GO.

03:26.060 --> 03:28.688
YOU SHOULD CALL JASMINE AND SAY
YOU WANT IN.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.335
EXCEPT YOU SHOULDN'T USE
THOSE WORDS.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.472
- I DON'T GET IT.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.680
IS THERE A SEXUAL JOKE
IN THERE?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.961
- [laughs]
- AMBER, I'M COMING IN.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.241
- MOM, CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A MINUTE?

03:37.280 --> 03:38.656
I'M SHOWERING.
- YES. CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?

03:38.700 --> 03:39.860
I'M JUST BRUSHING MY TEETH.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.970
HEY, DO YOU HAVE
THE TOOTHPASTE IN THERE?

03:42.010 --> 03:42.795
- NO, NO, NO.
- [screaming] OH, MY GOD!

03:42.840 --> 03:45.001
- HEY, MRS. BRA--
IT'S JUST ME.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.563
- NO, YOU'RE DEAD.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.874
GET OUT!
NO, NOT NOW.

03:47.910 --> 03:50.777
LATER.
[screams]

03:50.810 --> 03:52.778
- WE'RE SCREWED.

03:52.810 --> 03:55.370
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

03:55.400 --> 03:57.846
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

03:57.890 --> 04:00.336
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

04:00.370 --> 04:02.816
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

04:02.860 --> 04:05.408
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

04:05.450 --> 04:07.657
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

04:07.690 --> 04:09.965
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:10.000 --> 04:12.446
FOREVER YOUNG

04:12.490 --> 04:14.936
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

04:14.970 --> 04:17.359
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

04:17.390 --> 04:19.904
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

04:19.940 --> 04:21.908
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

04:21.950 --> 04:24.908
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

04:24.950 --> 04:26.872
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

04:26.920 --> 04:29.059
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:29.090 --> 04:31.706
FOREVER YOUNG

04:31.750 --> 04:33.980
MAY YOU STAY

04:34.030 --> 04:37.306
FOREVER YOUNG

04:40.030 --> 04:43.033
- AH!
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

04:43.070 --> 04:45.721
- EXCUSE ME, BUT WHO THE HELL
IS THAT RUNNING OUT OF MY HOUSE?

04:45.760 --> 04:47.489
AMBER!
JEEZ.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.385
- DAD, IT'S AMBER'S BOY--
EX-BOYFRIEND FROM FRESNO.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.284
DON'T--DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- I CAN'T GET ANY PRIVACY.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.628
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A TATI'LETALE?

04:51.670 --> 04:52.762
- WAIT--
DAMIEN, THE DEMON SEED?

04:52.800 --> 04:53.903
- WHY IS EVERYBODY YELLING
AT ME?

04:53.940 --> 04:55.453
- WE GOT TO SET
SOME BOUNDARIES, AMBER.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.944
- CALM DOWN, GRANDPA.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.493
- I'M NOT YELLING AT YA.
- YES, YOU ARE.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.736
- IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S MY HOUSE!

04:59.780 --> 05:01.941
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT, DAD.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.811
[sighs]

05:06.090 --> 05:07.955
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.787
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

05:09.820 --> 05:10.787
- YOU'RE MAD AT ME
BECAUSE OF MR. CYR.

05:10.820 --> 05:11.684
BECAUSE OF DATING YOUR TEACHER.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.709
- PLEASE, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.512
- AND I KNOW YOU'RE STILL MAD,
AND I'M SORRY.

05:14.550 --> 05:15.892
- IT'S FINE.
I DON'T CARE.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.751
- I'M SORRY I WENT OUT
WITH YOUR TEACHER.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.860
- IT'S FINE.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.551
- WE LEFI' FRESNO, YOU KNOW,
SO YOU COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.047
AND I PULLED YOU AWAY
FROM A LOT OF THINGS,

05:28.080 --> 05:29.945
BUT HE WAS ONE OF 'EM.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.778
AND THEN, TO HAVE HIM HERE
IN THE SHOWER,

05:32.810 --> 05:34.949
I MEAN, AMBER,
COME ON.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.868
DON'T SCREW EVERYTHING UP
FOR YOURSELF

05:36.920 --> 05:37.875
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.911
- THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.099
NOT EVERYTHING I DO
IS ABOUT YOU.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.644
I LOVE HIM,
AND HE LOVES ME, OKAY?

05:44.680 --> 05:46.056
- OH, GOD.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.579
- WHAT?

05:47.620 --> 05:51.408
- WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON MAKING EVERY MISTAKE I MADE?

05:51.450 --> 05:57.411
- YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEING A MISTAKE,

05:57.460 --> 06:00.623
ALL I HEAR IS THAT
MY WHOLE EXISTENCE IS A MISTAKE

06:00.670 --> 06:03.047
AND YOU...
- OH, NO. OH, NO, NO.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.832
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.019
- HONEY, I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE YOU SO UPSET.

06:07.050 --> 06:09.041
- PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE,
OKAY?

06:09.090 --> 06:11.467
PLEASE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.741
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.475
I'M REALLY SORRY.
- IT'S FINE, MOM!

06:18.510 --> 06:19.954
PLEASE, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
- OKAY.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.024
I'LL COME BACK.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.964
- DON'T TAKE
ANY RUBBER BANDS OFF, PLEASE!

06:29.000 --> 06:30.797
- WAIT, WAIT, WHOA.
WHY?

06:30.830 --> 06:32.889
- WELL, BECAUSE I'VE GOT 'EM
ALL COUNTED UP.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.032
18 BLUE,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.934
53 REDS,

06:35.980 --> 06:39.143
118 BROWN.
THERE'S TOO MANY BROWN.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.908
AND I DON'T WANT THE BROWN
RUBBER BANDS TO TAKE OVER.

06:40.950 --> 06:44.010
I WANT MY BALL. I WANT MY BALL!
- OKAY.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.221
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:45.260 --> 06:46.818
LET'S GO UPSTAI RS.

06:46.850 --> 06:47.839
WE'RE GONNA FINISH
GETTING READY,

06:47.890 --> 06:49.983
AND WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS
IN THE MORNING.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.054
- I WANT MY BALL.
- NO. NO.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.909
HEY, HEY.
- I WANT MY BALL!

06:52.960 --> 06:57.579
- SWEETHEART, THE BALL
IS STAYING RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

06:57.620 --> 06:59.133
- PLEASE, I WANT MY BALL.
- NO.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.728
WE WILL NOT TOUCH IT.
I PROMISE YOU.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.990
WE'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE IT.
OKAY?

07:03.040 --> 07:04.723
I PROMISE.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.762
NOW GET UPSTAIRS.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.566
- SHE WAS ALWAYS ASKING

07:18.610 --> 07:20.225
WHERE'S THE NEAREST BAR

07:20.260 --> 07:23.673
WELL, PEDAL ON THE GAS, KID

07:23.710 --> 07:25.780
GETTING, PLAYING HARD, HARD

07:25.820 --> 07:28.266
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN

07:28.300 --> 07:30.860
COOKING UP A SHARK

07:30.890 --> 07:31.925
WHILE SALLY'S OUT PREPARING

07:31.960 --> 07:34.758
WITTY REMARKS,
WITTY REMARKS

07:34.790 --> 07:36.894
WITTY REMARKS

07:37.940 --> 07:41.000
YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

07:41.040 --> 07:44.589
- I'M SORRY.
YOUR AMBER'S GRANDFATHER,

07:44.630 --> 07:45.938
THE VIETNAM VET.

07:45.980 --> 07:50.565
- WELL, DAMIEN, GEE,
I'M JUST SURE YOU'RE A NICE GUY,

07:50.600 --> 07:54.013
AND EVERYTHING, BUT YOU LEFT
YOUR SOCK IN MY HOUSE,

07:54.050 --> 07:55.745
BUT YOU TOOK
MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.288
HERE'S YOUR SOCK.

07:58.330 --> 08:01.709
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A 20,

08:01.750 --> 08:04.810
AND I WANT YOU
TO FILL UP YOUR TANK,

08:04.860 --> 08:08.091
AND I WANT YOU
TO CLEAR OUT OF HERE.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.129
AND I'M ASKING YOU
NICELY.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.922
- WHAT ABOUT AMBER?

08:10.970 --> 08:17.034
- DAMIEN, IF THIS VAN
IS WITHIN A FIVE-MILE RADIUS

08:17.080 --> 08:19.310
OF MY HOUSE,
I'LL KNOW IT.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.804
'CAUSE I CAN SMELL IT.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.149
AND THEN YOU AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE A VISIT,

08:23.190 --> 08:26.045
AND I'M GONNA SPEND
SOME QUIET TIME WITH YOU.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.159
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

08:27.190 --> 08:29.078
- SIR, I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW

08:29.120 --> 08:32.192
THAT I CONSIDER MYSELF
A STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY.

08:32.230 --> 08:35.882
LIVE AND LET LIVE.
I MEAN NO HARM TO ANYONE.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.923
- I AM AN IRRATIONAL HARDASS
WITH RAGE ISSUES.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.616
DON'T PISS ME OFF.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.177
[engine starts]

08:53.320 --> 08:54.730
- COME IN, COME IN.
- THANKS.

08:54.770 --> 08:56.180
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

08:56.220 --> 08:57.209
- OH, UM...
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:57.260 --> 08:58.943
- JUST--YEAH.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.663
- I WAS GONNA MAKE SOME TEA.
DO YOU WANT SOME?

09:00.710 --> 09:02.223
- SURE.
- CHAMOMILE OR ORANGE PEKOE

09:02.260 --> 09:04.114
OR GREEN?
- WHATEVER. PERFECT.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.196
- WHATEVER? OKAY.
- HI, MAX.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.881
- MAX, BUDDY,
AUNT JULIA JUST SAID HI TO YOU.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.299
- OH, DID YOU KNOW
THAT PILL BUGS AND SOW BUGS

09:13.340 --> 09:16.264
ARE OFTEN MISTAKENLY THOUGHT OF
AS INSECTS,

09:16.310 --> 09:19.894
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY CLASSIFIED
IN THE GROUP CALLED ISOPODS...

09:19.930 --> 09:21.795
- HE GOT A NEW BOOK
ON ROLY-POLIES TODAY.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.697
HEY, BUDDY, HONEY, AUNT JULIA'S
PROBABLY NOT IN THE--

09:24.730 --> 09:27.073
HONEY.
SO ADAM IS NOT HERE.

09:27.110 --> 09:29.863
HE'S AT THE OFFICE.
UM...

09:29.910 --> 09:32.663
- THAT'S FINE. I ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

09:32.710 --> 09:33.904
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:33.950 --> 09:37.670
- THIS IS GONNA SOUND STUPID.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.019
- OKAY.
- IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS BALL.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.391
SYDNEY'S OBSESSED WITH IT,

09:41.440 --> 09:46.059
AND BASICALLY I JUST WANTED
TO ASK YOU

09:46.100 --> 09:48.955
IF YOU COULD TELL ME ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, SOME OF THE FIRST SIGNS

09:49.000 --> 09:50.786
THAT YOU SAW WITH MAX.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.250
- UM, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A SEAT?

09:56.280 --> 09:57.759
- OKAY.
- AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.869
I'M JUST GONNA TRY
TO RALLY HIM TO GET UPSTAIRS.

09:58.900 --> 09:59.867
- WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.174
- NOTHING, BABE.
- HAVE A SEAT.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.074
- THANKS.
- CAN YOU DO MOMMY A FAVOR?

10:03.110 --> 10:03.929
I NEED TO TALK
TO AUNT JULIA ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:03.980 --> 10:04.833
HONEY, PLEASE,
I JUST WANT TO TALK

10:04.880 --> 10:06.313
TO AUNT JULIA
FOR A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.351
THANK YOU.
- COME UP SOON SO I CAN GET

10:08.400 --> 10:10.868
MY STICKERS.
- I WILL. I PROMISE.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.911
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

10:12.950 --> 10:16.704
UM, I AM 100% SURE THAT YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.889
- HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
ABOUT THAT?

10:18.920 --> 10:20.330
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.645
BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN...

10:22.690 --> 10:25.375
- OKAY, SHE COUNTED
THE NUMBER OF RUBBER BANDS.

10:25.410 --> 10:28.299
SHE KNOWS HOW MANY OF EACH COLOR
THERE ARE.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.966
AND SHE'S SO UTTERLY FIXATED
ON IT

10:31.000 --> 10:32.695
THAT SHE CAN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT
ANYMORE IF YOU TALK TO HER.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.005
- OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.247
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
DR. PELIKAN'S NUMBER.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.973
HE'S OUR DOCTOR
THAT WE USE FOR MAX.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.807
HE'S AMAZING.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.468
AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU
IF ANYTHING'S GOING ON,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.388
WHICH I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG.

10:45.430 --> 10:46.465
I REALLY DON'T.
- OKAY.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.183
- I JUST WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.983
- YEAH, I'M--I'M, YOU KNOW...
- OH, JULIA.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.123
- I'LL BE FINE.
- IT'S OKAY.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.720
- OH, SO STUPID.
I'M SORRY.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.854
- IT'S NOT STUPID AT ALL.
IT'S NOT.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.996
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON, HONEY.
- WHY?

11:00.030 --> 11:02.237
- BECAUSE WHEN JULIA TOLD ME
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG

11:02.280 --> 11:04.373
WITH SYDNEY, PART OF ME
FELT GLAD AND HAPPY AND, LIKE--

11:04.420 --> 11:06.445
- A BIG PART?
- LIKE I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.799
IT WAS WEIRD. IT WAS LIKE
THIS FEELING JUST CAME OVER ME--

11:08.840 --> 11:09.932
- WELL, I THINK
THAT'S HUMAN,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.039
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.002
- WHAT WOULD BE SO WRONG
WITH HAVING SOMEBODY ELSE

11:13.050 --> 11:15.041
IN THE FAMILY LIKE MAX?
- WELL, IT DOESN'T FEEL FAIR.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.809
- EXACTLY.
AND HE WOULD BE LESS ISOLATED.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.944
- WE'D BE LESS ISOLATED.

11:18.980 --> 11:19.730
- YOU'RE HORRIBLE TOO.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.498
YOU ARE--
YOU'RE HORRIBLE TOO.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.223
YOU WERE THINKING IT.
- I'M NOT HORRIBLE.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.363
- YOU'RE THE HORRIBLEST.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.152
AND THOSE JEANS
ARE JUST TERRIBLE.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.293
- WHY DO YOU THINK MY DAD THINKS
I HAVE REAL ESTATE ACUMEN?

11:28.340 --> 11:30.365
I THINK HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.
- TAKE THESE INSTEAD.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.923
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
YOUR SISTER'S FACE, THOUGH.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.370
SHE WAS TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.968
LOOK AT SYDNEY
COMPARED TO MAX.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.729
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THESE KIDS
HAVE THE SAME THING.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.034
- MAYBE SHE HAS A.D.D.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.105
- YEAH, OR O.T.B.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.448
- OFF-TRACK BETTING?
- O.C.D.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.798
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

11:41.830 --> 11:42.831
- WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.007
I DID DO ONE GOOD THING.

11:44.040 --> 11:44.972
- WHAT'S THAT?

11:45.010 --> 11:46.216
- I DIDN'T TELL HER

11:46.250 --> 11:47.865
ABOUT MAX'S RUBBER BAND BALL.

11:47.910 --> 11:49.878
- WELL, SEE,
YOU'RE NOT HORRIBLE.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.979
- I KNOW.
- YOU'RE A SWEETIE.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.214
- I AM SWEET.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.249
- KABOOM.
- POW.

11:53.290 --> 11:54.325
- LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.988
KABOOM !

11:57.020 --> 11:59.193
ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, I FEEL BETTER.

11:59.230 --> 12:00.333
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.156
NOW YOU COULD MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.260
- [laughs]
I'LL GET YOU THE LOTION.

12:05.310 --> 12:08.131
- ALL RIGHT.
- RIGHT BACK. LOTION RUB.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.759
- OOH, BATMAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:19.800 --> 12:20.903
- WE DID BATMAN
TWO YEARS AGO.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.999
- DOES HE LIKE G.I. JOE?

12:23.050 --> 12:25.382
- HIS FRIEND HAD
A G.I. JOE PARTY LAST MONTH.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.876
- WELL, I KNOW
HE LIKES SPONGEBOB.

12:27.910 --> 12:31.494
- HE LOVES SPONGEBOB.
WE DID THAT LAST YEAR.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.189
- MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE ASKED
FOR THE LIST OF THINGS

12:33.230 --> 12:34.504
THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE.

12:34.540 --> 12:37.191
- YOU WANTED TO COME HERE.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

12:37.230 --> 12:40.028
- WELL, HE'S MY KID.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.472
I WANT TO PLAN HIS PARTY.
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.274
- HOW ABOUT THIS?
BASEBALL. THINK IT'D BE CUTE?

12:46.310 --> 12:47.789
- YEAH, OKAY.
- YEAH?

12:47.830 --> 12:49.240
- YEAH,
BRAVERMANS LOVE BASEBALL.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.417
- GREAT.
- OKAY.

12:50.450 --> 12:51.963
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

12:52.010 --> 12:53.898
- PAPER PLATES AND UTENSILS.
ABOUT A DOZEN.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.316
- OKAY, WAIT,
A DOZEN?

12:55.360 --> 12:59.069
THAT'S NOT EVEN GONNA COVER
MY FAMILY.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.326
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.907
ARE YOU SAYING
MY FAMILY'S NOT INVITED?

13:01.950 --> 13:04.043
- YOU'VE SEEN MY APARTMENT.
IT'S TINY.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.467
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY'RE HIS FAMILY TOO.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.298
- OKAY, SO HOW ABOUT YOU
INVITE FOUR FROM YOUR FAMILY?

13:09.340 --> 13:13.959
- I'LL JUST--LIKE SURVIVOR.
I'LL JUST PICK FOUR.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.433
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY PEOPLE
FROM YOUR FAMILY ARE GOING?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.820
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

13:18.860 --> 13:23.308
- I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE, 10, MAYBE 15.

13:23.350 --> 13:26.968
- OH, JUST 10 OR 15.

13:27.010 --> 13:29.934
FINE.
JUST, WILL YOU PROMISE ME

13:29.980 --> 13:32.039
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
AN A'S THEME PARTY

13:32.080 --> 13:33.047
AND NOT A GIANTS?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.947
- A'S?
- YEAH.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.187
- STEP ASIDE.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.289
- OH, YOU--
YOU DON'T--OH.

13:40.330 --> 13:43.606
[chuckles]
THIS IS GONNA GET UGLY.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.606
- SYDNEY IS A GREAT KID.

13:45.650 --> 13:49.097
SHE IS PLAYFUL AND COOPERATIVE.
- THANK YOU.

13:49.130 --> 13:50.927
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.588
- JULIA, JUST...
- I WOULDN'T SAY WRONG.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.966
SHE DOESN'T TEST
IN THE NORMAL RANGE.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.523
SYDNEY IS GII-TED.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.627
- I'M SORRY. WHAT?
- SHE'S--

14:07.670 --> 14:08.637
- SHE TESTS

14:08.670 --> 14:11.639
WAY ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE
FOR HER AGE.

14:11.670 --> 14:14.980
HER ISSUES IN SCHOOL ARE
PROBABLY COMING FROM BOREDOM.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.500
SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S IN AN ENVIRONMENT

14:17.540 --> 14:19.087
WHERE SHE IS BEING CHALLENGED.

14:19.130 --> 14:21.052
SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL HAVE
TO MONITOR OVER TIME,

14:21.100 --> 14:22.670
AND SOMETHING THAT,
AS PARENTS,

14:22.720 --> 14:26.167
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF,
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO.

14:26.210 --> 14:28.963
- I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.
- GOOD.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.410
- WE'RE DRIVING
IN THE SLOWEST LANE.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.894
WHAT ARE WE DOING,
ABOUT 30?

14:31.940 --> 14:33.100
- HEY, I'M DRIVING.
- NOT VERY WELL.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.107
YOU'RE DRIVING
IN THE SLOWEST LANE.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.381
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TRIP
TO THE GRAND CANYON?

14:36.420 --> 14:37.648
- YEAH.
IT WAS A GOOD TIME.

14:37.700 --> 14:42.000
- YEAH. REMEMBER, YOU VOMITED
ALL OVER YOUR MOTHER'S HEAD?

14:42.050 --> 14:43.597
- YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD,
THAT WASN'T ME.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.948
THAT WAS CROSBY.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.151
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, GO AHEAD AND DENY IT.

14:46.190 --> 14:47.498
BLAH!
[laughs]

14:47.540 --> 14:49.053
YOU KNOW,
I HAD A LITTLE CONFRONTATION

14:49.090 --> 14:51.058
WITH THE KID, AND MAYBE
I WAS A LITTLE HARD ON HIM.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.364
I'M NOT SURE.
SCARED THE HELL OUT OF HIM.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.719
- ALL RIGHT.
- DO YOU THINK THEY CAUGHT

14:53.750 --> 14:54.910
THE ZODIAC KILLER?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.269
MOVE OVER.
WE GOT A LANE OPEN.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.504
- YOU KNOW WHAT--
DAD, DAD, DAD.

14:58.550 --> 15:00.711
- HOW'S THE SEX LIFE?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.478
- MY SEX LIFE IS FINE.
WHY?

15:02.520 --> 15:03.407
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.304
- YOU LEARNED TO HAVE SEX
IN VIETNAM?

15:05.350 --> 15:07.557
- YEAH, BASICALLY.
WELL, I WAS A KID, YOU KNOW?

15:07.590 --> 15:10.309
I MEAN, GOSH, THOSE GIRLS COULD
TEACH YOU SO MUCH, YOU KNOW.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.931
JUST--I WAS READY TO LEARN.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.550
SHE'S NOT HAVING ORGASMS?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.148
SO YOU WERE OKAY?
IT WAS ALL KRISTINA'S FAULT?

15:16.190 --> 15:18.283
'CAUSE THE BRAVERMANS, YOU KNOW,
THE BRAVERMAN MEN,

15:18.330 --> 15:19.706
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
- LOOK.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.628
- WE'RE STRONG
IN THE SEXUAL DEPARTMENT, SON.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.739
IS THIS EMBARRASSING
TO YOU?

15:22.780 --> 15:24.259
- YEAH. YEAH, IT IS
A LITTLE BIT.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.632
- I'M GONNA TICKLE YOU.
- GET OFF.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.740
IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED TO COME
OUT HERE AND TAKE THIS DRIVE?

15:29.790 --> 15:30.779
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

15:30.820 --> 15:31.957
- NO, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU...

15:32.000 --> 15:34.685
- DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE GONNA SHOW ME?

15:34.720 --> 15:36.608
- NO, I DON'T.
I WANT TO KEEP IT AS A SURPRISE.

15:36.650 --> 15:37.753
IT'S GONNA BE VERY EXCITING.

15:37.790 --> 15:39.519
NOW I GOT TO PEE.

15:39.550 --> 15:40.756
HOW ABOUT A REST STOP?
- WHAT ARE YOU, FIVE YEARS OLD?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.688
- HOW DO YOU UNSCREW THIS THING?

15:42.730 --> 15:44.038
- DON'T PEE IN THE CUP.
I'LL PULL OVER UP HERE.

15:52.810 --> 15:55.631
- HELLO?

15:55.670 --> 15:57.604
WHO'S THERE?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.323
- HEY, MISS BRAVERMAN.

15:59.370 --> 16:01.258
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.335
IF MY FATHER SEES YOU...

16:02.370 --> 16:05.021
- HE HINTED
THAT I SHOULD WASH UP,

16:05.060 --> 16:07.233
BUT THEN I SAW THESE PLANTS
THAT NEEDED ATTENTION.

16:07.270 --> 16:12.060
- DAMIEN, LISTEN, YOU SEEM
LIKE A, YOU KNOW, AN OKAY GUY,

16:12.100 --> 16:15.172
BUT AMBER'S FROM A BROKEN HOME.

16:15.210 --> 16:16.757
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

16:16.800 --> 16:19.030
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP

16:19.080 --> 16:21.662
FROM A SANDWICH YET,
AND THE POINT IS

16:21.700 --> 16:23.486
I WANT HER
TO FOCUS ON HERSELF,

16:23.530 --> 16:25.669
ON HER FUTURE,
SCHOOL, MAYBE EVEN COLLEGE.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.497
- YEAH.
- THERE'S AN OLD EXPRESSION.

16:27.530 --> 16:30.351
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,
SET THEM FREE.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.743
IF THEY COME BACK,
THEY'RE YOURS.

16:32.780 --> 16:37.058
IF THEY DON'T,
THEY NEVER WERE.

16:37.090 --> 16:38.057
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.056
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.649
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:43.690 --> 16:48.411
IT ISN'T THAT EASY.

16:48.450 --> 16:51.032
BUT IT WOULD
REALLY HELP HER OUT.

16:51.070 --> 16:54.039
JUST FOR NOW,
YOU KNOW.

16:55.660 --> 16:58.356
- OH.
OH, BOY.

16:58.390 --> 17:00.119
I GOT THIS.
- YOU GOT THIS.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.356
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

17:01.390 --> 17:03.278
- I GOT THIS. OKAY.
- I BELIEVE IN YOU.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.319
[knock at door]

17:04.360 --> 17:06.043
both: HI.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.114
- KRISTINA.
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.320
- I'M GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

17:08.370 --> 17:09.814
- I ONLY HAVE A MINUTE.
CAN I COME IN?

17:09.850 --> 17:10.748
- OH, PLEASE.
- OKAY, GREAT.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.407
- HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

17:12.440 --> 17:13.714
- I'M GOOD.
- YEAH?

17:13.750 --> 17:14.648
- YEAH, THANK YOU.
WE'RE GOOD.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.784
WE'RE GOOD.
- I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY

17:16.820 --> 17:18.196
AND DROP OFF A COUPLE OF BOOKS
FOR YOU.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.468
- OH.
- THEY WERE A REAL COMFORT

17:19.520 --> 17:20.782
TO ADAM AND ME.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.582
AND I ALSO WANTED TO TELL YOU
THE OTHER DAY

17:22.620 --> 17:23.860
WHEN YOU STOPPED BY,

17:23.900 --> 17:25.549
I DON'T THINK
THAT I FULLY EXPRESSED TO YOU

17:25.590 --> 17:28.388
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU
AND SYDNEY AND YOUR FAMILY.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.728
AND I JUST--
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

17:29.770 --> 17:31.488
THAT YOU'RE WITH US
IN OUR HEARTS.

17:31.530 --> 17:34.215
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.569
WE LOVE YOU TOO,
AND, NO, I KNEW THAT.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.808
- IF YOU NEED ANY--
- YEAH, KRISTINA...

17:39.850 --> 17:42.876
- YEAH?
- UM...

17:42.920 --> 17:46.128
YOU KNOW...

17:46.160 --> 17:49.744
WE--
AS SOON AS WE HEAR ANYTHING...

17:49.790 --> 17:51.098
- YOU'LL CALL ME.
- I WILL CALL YOU.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.472
EXACTLY.
THANK YOU.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.829
- WE DON'T KNOW YET, SO...
- YEAH.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.475
WE'LL SEE.
OKAY.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.203
- I GOTTA RUN.
- OKAY, GREAT.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.559
- YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.865
- OKAY, THANKS.
YOU TOO.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.698
both: OKAY. BYE.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.721
- I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

18:07.770 --> 18:11.149
- WHA--
- YOU WERE SO STRONG.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.806
I THOUGHT SHE TOOK THAT
RATHER WELL.

18:15.810 --> 18:18.153
- SHE JUST WENT OUT
WITH DAMIEN

18:18.200 --> 18:19.770
AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO LIE ABOUT IT.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.299
- THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

18:22.410 --> 18:23.502
IN THIS CONTEXT,
IT SHOWS

18:23.550 --> 18:25.643
A COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT.

18:25.690 --> 18:28.409
- SWEETIE, YOU CAN'T LIVE
THEIR LIFE FOR THEM.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.725
YOU KNOW?

18:30.760 --> 18:36.699
REALLY. THE BEST YOU CAN DO
IS HELP THEM AVOID MAKING

18:36.730 --> 18:37.890
SOME OF THE MISTAKES YOU MADE.
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.931
- I FAILED AT THAT
ALREADY.

18:39.980 --> 18:40.833
- YOU HAVEN'T.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.872
- WHY DIDN'T I JUST LET
DAD KILL HIM?

18:42.910 --> 18:45.526
I'M OUT HERE QUOTING
JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL

18:45.570 --> 18:46.389
LIKE AN IDIOT.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.603
- YOU WERE OBSESSED
WITH THAT BOOK.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.562
AND AMBER LIKED IT TOO,
DIDN'T SHE?

18:50.610 --> 18:54.330
- WHY DOES SHE HATE ME,
MOM?

18:54.370 --> 18:58.818
- DAUGHTERS HATE THEIR MOTHERS.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.816
I THINK
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.784
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEN THEY COME BACK.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.838
SARAH...

19:16.870 --> 19:19.498
YOU'RE MY BEST ONE.

19:19.530 --> 19:24.183
MAYBE NOT MY BEST ONE,
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I...

19:24.230 --> 19:27.324
MOST IDENTIFY WITH.

19:31.990 --> 19:34.550
- NOT PERFECT ADAM?

19:34.580 --> 19:36.753
- NO.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.473
YOU'RE THE BRAVE ONE.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.751
YOU TAKE RISKS.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.961
YOU ALWAYS TOOK A CHANCE.

19:44.010 --> 19:47.457
YOU DECLARED YOUR INDEPENDENCE
PRETTY EARLY ON,

19:47.490 --> 19:48.627
AND YOU WENT FOR IT.

19:52.530 --> 19:54.452
YOU HAVE TO HONOR
THAT PERSON.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.628
THAT YOU ARE.

19:57.670 --> 20:00.946
'CAUSE I DO.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.671
I MEAN,
MAYBE I NEVER SAID IT

20:05.720 --> 20:07.950
IN, YOU KNOW,
THOSE EXACT WORDS BEFORE,

20:07.990 --> 20:09.230
BUT...

20:15.760 --> 20:18.274
SWEETIE,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.762
OH, SWEETIE.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.761
I PROMISE.

20:35.820 --> 20:36.775
- THINK ABOUT THIS.
IF YOU BUY IT,

20:36.820 --> 20:38.048
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
TO HANG ON TO IT

20:38.090 --> 20:40.297
BEFORE IT PAYS OFF?
- [laughs]

20:40.340 --> 20:42.786
WELL, THAT'S THE GREAT THING,
SON, IS I ALREADY OWN IT.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.789
- WELL, THEN WHAT
DO YOU NEED ME FOR?

20:45.830 --> 20:48.469
- WELL, LOOK, BEFORE I DO
ANYTHING ELSE WITH IT,

20:48.520 --> 20:50.920
I WAS THINKING WHAT A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY THIS WOULD BE

20:50.970 --> 20:52.756
FOR YOU, YOU KNOW,
FOR YOUR COMPANY, RIGHT?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.007
A NEW MANUFACTORY
AND A FACTORY,

20:55.040 --> 20:56.519
YOU KNOW,
THAT SORT OF THING.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.279
AND I WAS THINKING
THAT YOUR COMPANY

20:59.320 --> 21:01.971
COULD BUY IT FROM ME
FOR A PRICE...

21:02.010 --> 21:05.662
ADAM, WHEN IT COMES BACK, THIS
PLACE IS GONNA BE UNTOUCHABLE.

21:05.710 --> 21:08.770
IT'S GONNA BE
A GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.394
WHO THE HELL, YOU KNOW,
WANTS TO BUILD A FACTORY

21:12.440 --> 21:14.089
IN THAILAND
OR MEXICO?

21:14.130 --> 21:15.404
I MEAN, COME ON.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.850
YOU GOT THE SAVINGS RIGHT HERE.

21:16.890 --> 21:18.755
PLUS, YOU CAN HIRE
AMERICAN WORKERS.

21:18.790 --> 21:22.658
NOW YOU'RE INTO THAT, RIGHT?
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.

21:22.690 --> 21:23.896
[sighs]

21:23.930 --> 21:26.581
WELL, WHO OWNS
THE REST OF THE COMPLEX?

21:26.630 --> 21:28.382
- OFFICE PARK.
- SORRY.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.762
- OTHER ENTITIES.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.722
I MEAN,
SOME OF IT'S IN FORECLOSURE.

21:31.770 --> 21:33.522
THAT'S WHY THE CONSTRUCTION
IS STALLED,

21:33.560 --> 21:34.834
BUT I MEAN, COME ON,
IT'S STILL GOT--

21:34.870 --> 21:36.974
STILL GOT PLENTY
OF ADVANTAGES.

21:37.010 --> 21:39.979
HEY, YOU STILL GOT THAT--
THE CAMERA THING ON YOUR PHONE?

21:40.020 --> 21:41.874
- YEAH.
- WELL, OKAY, COME ON.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.319
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
SOME PICTURES,

21:43.370 --> 21:44.507
AND RIGHT OVER HERE,

21:44.540 --> 21:45.746
YOU CAN TAKE 'EM BACK
TO THE OFFICE

21:45.780 --> 21:46.747
AND DISCUSS IT
AMONGST YOURSELVES

21:46.780 --> 21:47.917
AND ALL OF THAT, RIGHT?

21:47.960 --> 21:50.337
I MEAN, ADAM, SON, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT SOME RAW SPACE.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.509
- DEFINITELY RAW SPACE.
- ALL RIGHT?

21:52.550 --> 21:54.097
YOU GET IT?
- YUP.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.928
- OH, WHOA, THAT GOES
RIGHT ON THIS WALL HERE.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.938
- I THOUGHT
YOU SAID PUT IT HERE.

22:01.970 --> 22:05.963
- SO?
I WANT THAT HERE.

22:08.050 --> 22:11.736
- SO YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE
TWO THINGS HANGING HERE

22:11.770 --> 22:13.419
AND THEN NOTHYIL'I'PG OVER THERE?

22:13.470 --> 22:14.846
- THAT'S HOW YOUR FAMILY
DOES IT?

22:14.880 --> 22:17.087
- HOW MY FAM--
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU,

22:17.120 --> 22:18.109
THE PARTY EXPERT NOW?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.889
HOW MANY PARTIES
HAVE YOU THROWN?

22:19.920 --> 22:22.889
- YEAH, WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.740
- WE ARE NOT GONNA GO THERE
RIGHT NOW.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.508
- NO, WE'RE DOING THIS
RIGHT NOW.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.619
- NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.924
- LISTEN TO ME.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.520
YOU ROBBED ME OF FIVE YEARS
OF MY SON'S LIFE.

22:31.550 --> 22:32.858
WHAT GAVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO DO THAT?

22:35.830 --> 22:38.173
I'M DECORATING,
AND I'M SEEING PICTURES OF HIM

22:38.210 --> 22:41.008
ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND THAT'S
ALL I'M EVER GONNA SEE OF HIM

22:41.040 --> 22:42.382
AT THIS AGE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.624
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
CALLED ME BACK

22:43.670 --> 22:45.729
BECAUSE I CALLED YOU
THREE TIMES, FOUR TIMES,

22:45.770 --> 22:46.737
AND YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.

22:46.770 --> 22:47.907
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

22:47.950 --> 22:49.941
- YOU KNOW, LEAVE ME A--
- LEAVE A MESSAGE

22:49.980 --> 22:51.151
ON YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE?

22:51.190 --> 22:52.748
"HEY, CROSBY,
IT'S JASMINE.

22:52.780 --> 22:53.986
I'M PREGNANT.
CALL ME BACK."

22:54.020 --> 22:55.817
- YEAH, ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER THAN WHAT YOU DID.

22:55.850 --> 22:57.602
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
AFTER THE THIRD CALL,

22:57.650 --> 22:59.811
I REALIZED
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO CALL BACK.

22:59.860 --> 23:02.988
I HAD THIS BIG,
SERIOUS THING TO DO--

23:03.030 --> 23:05.612
HAVE A BABY
AND RAISE THAT BABY,

23:05.660 --> 23:06.649
AND WHAT I DIDN'T NEED

23:06.690 --> 23:08.794
WAS SOME FLAKY GUY
IN THE PICTURE.

23:08.830 --> 23:10.798
- HEY, IT'S MY SON.

23:10.830 --> 23:12.457
YOU DON'T GET
TO JUST MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

23:12.490 --> 23:13.764
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I DON'T GET--

23:13.800 --> 23:15.973
THAT'S MY SON TOO.
I GAVE BIRTH TO HIM, OKAY?

23:16.010 --> 23:17.830
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
NOW YOU WANT TO PLAY DADDY?

23:17.870 --> 23:20.179
WHAT KIND OF FATHER
TAKES HIS SON ON A PLAY DATE

23:20.220 --> 23:22.142
AND LEAVES THEM WITH A STRANGER
IN A POOL?

23:22.190 --> 23:23.908
- IT'S NOT A STRANGER.
IT WAS A LIFEGUARD.

23:24.810 --> 23:25.913
- YEAH.

23:25.950 --> 23:27.747
- THIS IS HIS PARTY.
I'M HIS DAD.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.463
MY FAMILY IS HIS FAMILY.

23:29.510 --> 23:32.229
I WANT HIS COUSINS AND HIS AUNTS
AND HIS UNCLES HERE.

23:32.270 --> 23:36.502
THEY HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE HERE.

23:36.550 --> 23:38.165
HEY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

23:40.030 --> 23:41.725
- OKAY.
UM...

23:41.760 --> 23:47.039
YOU--YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT, UM, MY FAMILY

23:47.080 --> 23:49.867
ISN'T EXACTLY INCLINED
TOWARDS YOU.

23:50.910 --> 23:52.047
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

23:52.080 --> 23:57.666
- WELL, MY FATHER ABANDONED US,
AND THEY THINK YOU'RE--

23:57.710 --> 23:59.769
YOU DID JUST, LIKE,
THE SAME THING.

23:59.810 --> 24:01.607
- YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I HAD A KID.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.607
HOW IS THAT SIMILAR?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.983
- THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

24:05.020 --> 24:09.810
- WAIT, THEY THINK
THAT I KNEW ABOUT JABBAR

24:09.860 --> 24:10.997
AND THAT I JUST BLEW HIM OFF?

24:11.030 --> 24:13.089
- IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.960
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D EVER BE
BACK IN HIS LIFE AGAIN.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.161
- OH-HO-HO!

24:17.210 --> 24:18.791
- I'M SORRY.

24:18.830 --> 24:23.767
JUST INVITE EVERYONE.
HAVE 'EM ALL COME.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.869
WE'LL MANAGE.

24:24.910 --> 24:28.801
- I HAVE TO ADMIT I LIKE
WHEN YOU SCREW UP, KINDA.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.762
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE WE'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE...

24:30.810 --> 24:31.834
- [laughs]

24:34.610 --> 24:36.225
OKAY.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.840
- NO, NO,
HEY, HOLD UP.

24:39.890 --> 24:41.198
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS ON ME.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.674
- DAD, I CAN PAY
FOR MY OWN ROOM.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.121
- TWO ROOMS? COME ON.
THAT'S CRAZY.

24:46.170 --> 24:49.298
- UH, TWO DOUBLE BEDS?

24:49.340 --> 24:52.798
- YOU HAVE LOVELY EYES,
BY THE WAY.

24:52.830 --> 24:53.865
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

24:53.900 --> 24:55.037
- MANISHA.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.277
- MANISHA.
CAN YOU SAY THAT?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.595
[toilet flushes]

25:03.950 --> 25:05.838
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.565
ICE ROAD TRUCKERS.
COME ON.

25:08.610 --> 25:11.010
- HEY, DAD, CAN WE JUST PAUSE
WITH THE TV FOR A SECOND?

25:11.060 --> 25:12.880
I JUST WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.194
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:14.230 --> 25:16.027
- WITH THIS PROPERTY.

25:16.060 --> 25:19.268
YOU KNOW, THAT PLACE,
IT'S NOT A GREAT INVESTMENT.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.811
I WISH I THOUGHT IT WAS.

25:20.860 --> 25:22.612
AND YOU'RE A GREAT SALESMAN,
BUT I DON'T THINK

25:22.650 --> 25:24.163
YOU BELIEVE IT IS EITHER.

25:24.210 --> 25:25.097
- LONG-TERM IT IS.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.893
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, THEN, HOLD ON TO IT.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.168
- I CAN'T,
SONNY.

25:35.390 --> 25:36.618
- WHY NOT?

25:36.670 --> 25:39.764
- YOU'RE MY FIRSTBORN SON.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.119
I NEVER WANTED TO GO
TO YOU FOR ANYTHING.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.219
I GIVE TO YOU.

25:47.260 --> 25:50.912
ESPECIALLY NOW, I MEAN,
WITH MAX.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.882
- HOW BAD IS IT?
- IT'S BAD.

25:52.930 --> 25:55.922
I SAW THIS OPPORTUNITY.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.133
I MEAN, HOW THE HELL
WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

25:58.170 --> 26:00.377
THERE WAS GONNA BE A BUBBLE?

26:00.420 --> 26:02.627
I HAD TO TAKE A SECOND OUT
ON THE HOUSE

26:02.660 --> 26:05.311
SO I COULD GRAB IT,
AND THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

26:05.350 --> 26:07.215
- POPS.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.070
- WELL, I MEAN,
THE COUNTRY'S IN THE TOILET.

26:09.110 --> 26:12.113
IT'S NOT JUST ME.
- YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.944
LOOK, YOU HAVE GREAT INSTINCT S.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.915
IT'S JUST--LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S JUST TIMING LIKE YOU SAID.

26:19.950 --> 26:20.939
YOU KNOW?
- YEAH.

26:20.990 --> 26:22.014
- BAD TIMING.

26:23.020 --> 26:26.649
- OKAY, NOW, LOOKIT.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.716
NOW LISTEN HERE.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.405
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE AT ALL

26:32.450 --> 26:33.849
WITH YOUR COMPANY?

26:33.900 --> 26:35.788
- DAD, I SAID
I WILL TALK TO THEM.

26:35.830 --> 26:36.865
I WILL TALK TO THEM.

26:36.900 --> 26:37.889
- AND YOU SHOW 'EM THE PICTURES,

26:37.940 --> 26:39.658
AND YOU TELL 'EM THAT IT'S...
both: RAW SPACE.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.247
- I GOT IT.
RAW SPACE.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.283
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

26:49.330 --> 26:50.877
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.798
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU MIGHT LOSE THE HOUSE?

26:54.780 --> 26:57.010
I MEAN, DO YOU NEED
TO TALK TO MY ACCOUNTANT?

26:57.060 --> 26:59.984
- I HAVE AN ACCOUNTANT,
ADAM.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.952
- I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.810
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S SERIOUS.

27:03.860 --> 27:06.749
I MEAN,
WOULD WE BE HERE

27:06.790 --> 27:08.724
IF IT WASN'T SERIOUS?
COME ON.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.852
SERIOUS.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.961
- DOES ANYBODY ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

27:14.010 --> 27:15.409
HAVE YOU TOLD MOM?

27:15.460 --> 27:17.690
- OH, I CAN'T TELL HER THIS.

27:17.730 --> 27:21.143
- YOU HAVE TO TELL--
YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS FROM HER.

27:21.190 --> 27:25.968
LOOK, I WILL TALK
TO GORDON.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.057
OKAY?
- YEAH.

27:29.090 --> 27:30.318
- BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL MOM.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.980
- OKAY.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.278
- WANT TO SEE MY ROOM?
- SANDWICH?

27:45.310 --> 27:47.005
WOULD YOU LNEE’A SANDWICH?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.144
SANDWICH?
NO?

27:49.180 --> 27:51.239
WATCHING YOUR FIGURE?

27:51.290 --> 27:54.908
- HEY, CROSBY. I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET SOME PEOPLE.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.147
THIS IS MY BROTHER SEKOU.

27:57.190 --> 27:59.078
- OH, GREAT.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.280
- I TRIED TO RUN

28:00.330 --> 28:01.809
BUT COULDN'T GET

28:01.850 --> 28:03.818

28:03.850 --> 28:07.024
- AND THIS IS MY--
MY MOTHER RENEE.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.436
- HI.

28:08.470 --> 28:10.472

28:10.510 --> 28:11.818
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

28:11.860 --> 28:14.021

28:14.070 --> 28:15.958
SHEILA, COULD YOU HELP ME?
- YEAH, UM...

28:16.000 --> 28:17.274
[doorbell rings]

28:17.310 --> 28:18.823
- HI.
- HELLO.

28:18.860 --> 28:23.797
[greetings]

28:23.840 --> 28:26.388
- WHO ARE ALL THESE WHITE
PEOPLE? [laughs nervously]

28:26.420 --> 28:27.899
- THE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.248
- WE DID SEE ONE OF THOSE,
BUT--

28:29.290 --> 28:31.906
[indistinct conversation]

28:31.950 --> 28:33.212
- IT'S A HOUSEBOAT.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.739
THERE'S ACTUALLY A BEDROOM
AND A LIVING ROOM

28:34.780 --> 28:36.463
AND A KITCHEN.
IT'S PRETTY COMFORTABLE.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.503
- WELL, THAT'S
AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

28:39.540 --> 28:42.156
- SEKOU.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.237
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
- THANK YOU.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.067
- YOU NAMED HIM
AI-TER SEKOU TARUNGA,

28:47.100 --> 28:49.204
THE AFRICAN INDEPENDENCE LEADER,
I ASSUME.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.447
- NOW HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.163
- BERKELEY IN THE '605,
BABE.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.440
- OH, I HEAR THAT.

28:55.490 --> 28:57.799
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M SORRY, THIS IS WEIRD.

28:57.830 --> 29:01.243
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
AND ALL THAT STUFF,

29:01.290 --> 29:02.552
BUT WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
DUDE?

29:02.600 --> 29:05.319
- UM, I WISH
I HAD BEEN HERE.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.873
- YEAH, THAT'S YOUR LOSS.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.014
- YEAH.
NO ONE KNOWS THAT MORE THAN ME.

29:09.050 --> 29:11.393
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GLAD
I GET TO BE IN HIS LIFE NOW

29:11.430 --> 29:13.819
AND HOPEFULLY
BE A ROLE MODEL.

29:13.850 --> 29:14.771
- HE HAS A ROLE MODEL,
CROSBY.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.367
I'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE THE DAY HE WAS BORN.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.812
- SEKOU.
- NO, I'M JUST TELLING HIM

29:18.860 --> 29:20.020
HOW IT WAS.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.266
I DROVE HIM BACK
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

29:21.310 --> 29:23.824
I STOOD AT HIS CHRISTENING.
HUH?

29:23.860 --> 29:26.920
LOOK, I MOVED APARTMENTS
JUST TO BE CLOSER TO HIM.

29:26.970 --> 29:28.926
- I'M GONNA GO GET THE CAKE.

29:28.970 --> 29:29.823
SEKOU,
WOULD YOU HELP ME?

29:29.870 --> 29:32.134
- NO, I'M TELLING HIM
HOW IT WAS, MOM.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.239
- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING
IF I MAY.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.599
- DAD.
- ARE THERE ANY MORE

29:35.630 --> 29:36.904
OF THOSE LITTLE CORN MUFFINS?

29:36.940 --> 29:38.908
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE
A WONDERFUL FAMILY.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.498
I'VE MET YOU,
AND I LIKE YOU ALL,

29:40.530 --> 29:42.907
BUT WHY ARE YOU TREATING
MY SON

29:42.950 --> 29:44.918
LIKE HE'S A PARIAH?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.941
THE ONLY REASON
I CAN THINK OF

29:46.990 --> 29:47.979
IS BECAUSE HE'S WHITE.
- DAD!

29:48.020 --> 29:49.260
- GRANDPA, NO ONE--

29:49.300 --> 29:52.428
- WE THINK HE HAS TOURETTE'S.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.981
- HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT
THE WAY THAT IT SOUNDS.

29:54.030 --> 29:55.099
- STATING THE OBVIOUS.

29:55.130 --> 29:57.883
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S IRRESPONSIBLE.

29:57.930 --> 30:01.855
- RENEE,
THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.482
- WELL, THERE'S
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD LITTLE BOY HERE

30:04.520 --> 30:07.080
THAT HE HASN'T SEEN
FOR FIVE YEARS.

30:07.110 --> 30:11.001
- UM, ZEEK, I THINK
I UNDERSTAND

30:11.050 --> 30:12.358
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAY.

30:12.390 --> 30:15.279
EVERYONE HERE IS UPSET
WITH CROSBY

30:15.330 --> 30:19.869
BECAUSE THEY FEEL
THAT HE ABANDONED JABBAR AND ME.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.148
BUT HE DIDN'T.

30:21.190 --> 30:23.010
- WHAT?

30:23.060 --> 30:26.530
- I NEVER TOLD HIM

30:26.580 --> 30:27.911
ABOUT HIS SON.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.884
- YOU WHAT?
- WOW.

30:30.930 --> 30:34.161
- UH, IT WAS JUST,
UM, EASIER

30:34.210 --> 30:36.929
FOR ME TO LIE
TO ALL OF YOU

30:36.970 --> 30:41.896
AND LET YOU BELIEVE
THAT HE WAS JUST LIKE DAD.

30:41.940 --> 30:47.185
- EASIER FOR WHO,
YOU OR JABBAR?

30:47.220 --> 30:50.667
- LOOK, UM, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THE ONE

30:50.710 --> 30:53.224
THAT CHOSE TO HAVE
THIS BABY

30:53.260 --> 30:54.670
AND NOT LET HIS FATHER KNOW.

30:54.710 --> 30:58.191
IT WAS ME.
IT WAS ME.

30:58.230 --> 31:00.573
AND I'M SORRY.

31:00.610 --> 31:01.952
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE MAD
AT ANYONE,

31:01.990 --> 31:03.571
JUST BE MAD AT ME.

31:03.620 --> 31:06.475
DON'T BE MAD AT HIM.

31:08.210 --> 31:09.893
- IS IT TIME FOR CAKE?

31:09.930 --> 31:11.033
- [laughs]

31:11.070 --> 31:12.344
- OH, BUDDY, IS IT EVER.

31:12.380 --> 31:13.961
YEAH, LET'S EAT CAKE NOW.

31:14.010 --> 31:16.581
- MAYBE GRANDPA ZEEK CAN HELP US
CUT THE CAKE.

31:16.630 --> 31:18.552
- I'M ON TOP OF IT, RENEE,
I MUST SAY.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.419
EXCUSE ME.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.552
- TAKE IT EASY, THOUGH, DAD.
OKAY?

31:20.600 --> 31:23.421
[cheers and applause]

31:25.640 --> 31:28.427
- ALL RIGHT!

31:28.470 --> 31:31.052
- IS THIS TOO MUCH MAYONNAISE
STILL?

31:31.090 --> 31:32.705
- NO.
- NEVER TOO MUCH.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.718
- EXCUSE ME, BY THE WAY,
WHY WASN'T AMBER THERE TODAY?

31:34.750 --> 31:37.674
- UM, SHE...
- SHE WAS STUDYING.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.199
- OH, WELL, I THINK
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.684
- SORRY.
YEAH.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.995
- DID YOU TALK
TO MOM YET?

31:43.030 --> 31:44.679
- HEY, SONNY,
I TOLD YOU

31:44.730 --> 31:49.440
I WOULD TALK TO HER.
- OKAY.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.412
- KRISTINA.
- HEY.

31:51.460 --> 31:54.668
- UM, I'M RETURNING THIS.
I READ IT THREE TIMES.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.213
- YOU DID?
- I DID.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.490
I DID.
- WAS IT HELPFUL?

31:57.530 --> 31:59.179
- YEAH.
- IT'S HELPFUL, RIGHT?

31:59.220 --> 32:00.664
- I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE FACING.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.599
- WELL.
- I WANTED YOU TO KNOW ALSO,

32:03.640 --> 32:05.631
JUST, JOEL AND I BOTH,
WE WERE SO MOVED

32:05.680 --> 32:07.295
BY THE WAY
THAT YOU REACHED OUT,

32:07.330 --> 32:08.501
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT, SO...
- OH, MY GOSH.

32:08.540 --> 32:09.711
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU WOULD DO THE SAME.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.194
IT'S FINE.
- YEAH. THANK YOU.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.367
- HOW IS SYDNEY?
IS SHE GOOD?

32:12.410 --> 32:14.571
- SHE'S GOOD, YEAH.

32:14.620 --> 32:19.159
WE--WE GOT THE TEST RESULTS,

32:19.210 --> 32:21.371
HER TROUBLE'S STEMMING
FROM BOREDOM IN SCHOOL,

32:21.420 --> 32:24.309
AND SHE TESTED GIl-TED.

32:24.350 --> 32:26.557
- OH.

32:26.590 --> 32:28.217
GIl-TED.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.002
THAT'S GREAT.

32:30.050 --> 32:32.769
THAT'S--WHAT AM I--
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

32:32.810 --> 32:34.084
THAT'S AMAZING.
- YEAH.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.395
I WAS EM BARRASSED
TO TELL YOU THAT.

32:36.430 --> 32:37.658
- JULIA, NO.
- I'M SORRY.

32:37.710 --> 32:39.632
- THAT IS AMAZING.
- THANKS.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.126
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU AND HER.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.604
THAT'S GREAT.
- HEY, I'M GOING OUT.

32:43.650 --> 32:45.606
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
OKAY?

32:45.650 --> 32:47.572
GOOD NIGHT.

32:47.620 --> 32:50.134

32:52.170 --> 32:54.309
- HEY.

32:54.350 --> 32:55.339

32:57.140 --> 32:58.721
- WE MISSED YA
AT THE PARTY.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.034
- HOW WAS IT?
- IT WAS FUN.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.035
IT WAS GOOD.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.104
I SAVED YOU
A PIECE OF CAKE.

33:02.150 --> 33:03.219
- THAT'S NICE.
THAN KS.

33:03.250 --> 33:04.558
I'LL HAVE IT
WHEN I GET BACK.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.589
- OH, NO, TAKE IT WITH YOU.
IT'S A PAPER PLATE.

33:05.630 --> 33:07.427
- THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL HAVE IT WHEN I GET BACK.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.018
- WHY WON'T YOU TAKE THE CAKE?

33:09.050 --> 33:10.358
- I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THE CAKE.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.436
I'M DONE TRYING
TO CONTROL YOU.

33:15.470 --> 33:18.530
I--IT DOESN'T WORK.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.571
- YOU KNOW, I'M FINE.

33:20.610 --> 33:22.362
- ARE YOU?

33:24.100 --> 33:26.330
SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.169
I JUST DON'T WANT US
TO BE LIKE THIS.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.314
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

33:33.350 --> 33:37.593
I THINK I'LL JUST...

33:37.630 --> 33:42.146
TRY TO GET ALONG
WITH YOU

33:42.190 --> 33:44.704
AND...

33:44.740 --> 33:46.731
TRUST YOU.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.498
- OKAY.

33:48.540 --> 33:51.191
- OKAY.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.811
- I'M MEETING DAMIEN.
HE'S PICKING ME UP.

33:55.890 --> 33:58.859
- OKAY.

33:58.890 --> 34:03.611
- [sighs]

34:03.660 --> 34:07.380
SEE YOU LATER.
- SEE YOU LATER.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.677
[laughter]

34:24.710 --> 34:26.575
- YOU LOOK
LIKE A LITTLE BABY.

34:26.610 --> 34:29.226
IT'S ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.655
SO, LIKE, THE OTHER DAY,
I GOT A "C"

34:43.700 --> 34:45.839
ON THIS TEST THAT I WAS, LIKE,
SURE THAT I HAD ACED.

34:45.870 --> 34:47.280
_ A "C"?
- IT WAS 50 WEIRD.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.311
- WELL, I GUESS A "C'"S
BETTER THAN A "D,"

34:49.360 --> 34:50.759
AND YOU'VE HAD PLENTY
OF THOSE, RIGHT?

34:50.810 --> 34:51.799
- YEAH, I GUESS.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.149
- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ACE
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

34:54.190 --> 34:57.159
BUT THAT STUFF
DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.397
I MEAN,
AFTER THE ELECTRICAL GRID FAILS,

34:59.440 --> 35:00.748
I MEAN,
WHO'S GONNA SURVIVE?

35:00.780 --> 35:03.533
SOMEONE WHO GETS AN "A"
ON A TEST

35:03.580 --> 35:05.434
OR SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
IN THE SCHOOL OF LIFE?

35:08.310 --> 35:12.235
IT'S ALL COMING DOWN,
THE WHOLE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.689
- REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK?

35:16.730 --> 35:20.382
- YEAH.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.559
BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHAT YOU GET
ON A REPORT CARD

35:22.600 --> 35:24.522
IS GONNA SEEM
PRETTY INSIGNIFICANT

35:24.570 --> 35:27.209
WHEN YOU'RE LIVING
OFF THE LAND

35:27.260 --> 35:29.490
AND FENDING OFF "MAROODERS."

35:29.540 --> 35:32.873
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

35:32.920 --> 35:33.887
- MAROODERS.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.775
[laughter]

35:36.820 --> 35:38.219
- BUT YOU KNOW
IT'S MARAUDERS.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.407
- MAROODERS.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.408
- MM.
MARAUDERS.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.829
NO ONE SAYS THAT.
- MM, MARAUDERS.

35:43.860 --> 35:45.782
- OKAY?
- MARAUDERS.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.822
- EAT THIS.

35:48.870 --> 35:50.132
TCHH.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.719
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR TRIP.

35:55.770 --> 35:56.862
HOW'D IT GO?

35:56.910 --> 35:58.764
- WELL, IT WAS GREAT.

35:58.810 --> 36:01.699
- WAS OUR NUMBER ONE SON
HELPFUL?

36:01.740 --> 36:04.709
- NOW, I WILL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, THAT KID ADAM

36:04.740 --> 36:06.537
HAS GOT A GREAT HEAD
FOR BUSINESS.

36:06.570 --> 36:09.505
OH, YOU CAN SETTLE
AN ARGUMENT WE WERE HAVING.

36:09.540 --> 36:12.885
NOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TRIPS
GOING TO THE GRAND CANYON...

36:12.920 --> 36:14.615
[mutters indistinctly]

36:14.650 --> 36:17.642
WAS IT ADAM OR CROSBY

36:17.690 --> 36:20.375
THAT VOMITED ON YOUR HEAD?

36:20.410 --> 36:22.207
IT WAS SARAH.

36:22.240 --> 36:25.698
- BOY, YOU REALLY
DON'T REMEMBER, DO YOU?

36:25.730 --> 36:27.459
- WELL, I MEAN,
THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON.

36:27.490 --> 36:30.903
YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN QUITE
A BACKGROUND OF INFORMATION.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.589
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF ALL OF IT.

36:32.630 --> 36:35.451
- WELL, MAYBE THAT WAS BECAUSE
THE VOMIT WASN'T DRIPPING

36:35.500 --> 36:37.468
DOWN YOUR FACE.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.229
YOU WERE TOO BUSY LAUGHING.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.706
- [chuckles]

36:41.750 --> 36:45.607
OH, YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT WAS FUNNY.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.303
- THIS IS THE WAY IT WENT.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.581
JULIA GOT SICK

36:53.620 --> 36:56.680
AND THREW UP IN MY HAIR.

36:56.730 --> 36:59.699
SHE WAS SCREAMING
HER LITTLE HEART OUT.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.004
AND I WAS TRYING
TO COMFORT HER

37:01.040 --> 37:03.417
WHILE WIPING PUKE
OUT OF MY EYES.

37:03.460 --> 37:07.931
YOU WERE TOO BUSY LAUGHING
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT HELPING.

37:07.980 --> 37:11.359
YOU DID ME THE BIG FAVOR
OF PULLING INTO A GAS STATION.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.530
WHILE YOU WERE FILLING UP
THE TANK, I WAS IN THAT...

37:15.570 --> 37:20.678
BLECH, DISGUSTING BATHROOM
TRYING TO WASH THE VOMIT

37:20.720 --> 37:24.713
OUT OF MY HAIR
UNDER THE FAUCET IN THE SINK.

37:29.830 --> 37:34.585
- [sighs]

37:34.630 --> 37:38.908
MILLIE, I NEVER KNEW
IT UPSET YOU THAT MUCH.

37:38.940 --> 37:42.000
WOULD YOU ACCEPT
A BELATED APOLOGY?

37:42.050 --> 37:45.019
I'M SORRY.

37:45.050 --> 37:48.702
- HA.
SURE.

37:55.060 --> 37:58.575
SO WHAT ELSE ABOUT THE TRIP?
ANYTHING?

37:58.620 --> 38:01.339
- ADAM, HE SNORES
LIKE A CHAINSAW,

38:01.380 --> 38:04.679
BUT HE'S NOT
GOING TO ADMIT IT.

38:04.730 --> 38:09.417
WHAT ELSE CAN I TELL YOU?

38:09.450 --> 38:11.759
- [groans]

38:11.800 --> 38:15.076
- IS HE ASLEEP?
- YEAH. THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.975
- THANK GOD.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

38:18.010 --> 38:23.084
- WELL...
I FOUND SYDNEY'S BALL

38:23.120 --> 38:24.803
BENEATH HIS PILLOW.

38:24.850 --> 38:26.465
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

38:26.510 --> 38:27.886
- OH, MY GOD,
SHE GAVE IT TO HIM?

38:27.920 --> 38:29.808
- NO.
HE STOLE IT FROM HER.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.715
- HE STOLE IT FROM HER?
- UH-HUH.

38:31.750 --> 38:34.332
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.439
- OKAY, HONEY,
WE HAVE TO CALL JULIA AND JOEL.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.617
CALL THEM.
WHERE'S THE PHONE?

38:37.660 --> 38:38.991
- CALL THEM AND WHAT?
GIVE IT BACK?

38:39.040 --> 38:40.109
- YES.
- OH, SCREW THAT.

38:40.140 --> 38:41.619
- WHAT?
- LOOK, IF SHE'S

38:41.660 --> 38:43.514
SUCH A LITTLE GENIUS,
SHE CAN MAKE, YOU KNOW,

38:43.560 --> 38:45.141
A THOUSAND OF 'EM
USING COLD FUSION.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.727
- COLD FUSION?
- YEAH.

38:46.770 --> 38:49.455
- HONEY, YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THAT THIS IS NOT OKAY.

38:49.490 --> 38:50.627
HE CAN'T JUST TAKE THINGS
WITHOUT ASKING.

38:50.670 --> 38:52.763
- WELL, I DID TELL HIM.
- OKAY. GOOD. WHAT DID HE SAY?

38:52.810 --> 38:54.493
- HE SAID HE ASKED HER.

38:54.530 --> 38:56.157
- AND?
- AND SHE SAID NO.

38:56.190 --> 38:58.465
- SO HE JUST STOLE IT?
- MM-HMM.

38:59.710 --> 39:03.771
[laughter]

39:03.820 --> 39:04.889
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

39:04.920 --> 39:07.684
- YOU ARE, BUDDY.
- IS THAT MY RUBBER BAND BALL?

39:07.720 --> 39:08.948
- HUH?
- I COULDN'T FIND

39:09.000 --> 39:10.888
THE RUBBER BAND BALL
WHEN YOU GUYS WOKE ME UP

39:10.930 --> 39:11.919
WITH THE LAUGHING.

39:11.970 --> 39:13.540
- WHY DON'T YOU COME IN HERE?

39:13.590 --> 39:15.751
- WELL, I ASKED HER FOR IT.
- YOU DID?

39:15.800 --> 39:17.586
- YOU SAID
I JUST HAD TO ASK.

39:17.630 --> 39:19.006
- NO, I DIDN'T.

39:19.040 --> 39:23.693
- YOU JUST SAID YOU CAN
ONLY HAVE IT IF YOU ASK HER.

39:23.740 --> 39:26.459
- BUT SHE HAS TO SAY YES.
- YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.525
- WHAT YOU READING ABOUT?

39:28.570 --> 39:31.084
WATER SCAVENGER BEETLE.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.088
EMERALD CLICK BEETLE.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.918
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE BEETLE?

39:35.950 --> 39:38.714
- HERCULES BEETLE.
- HERCULES BEETLE.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.919
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU, BUDDY?

39:43.960 --> 39:48.135
HMM?
- AS MUCH AS I LOVE BEETLES.

40:00.840 --> 40:01.977
- WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

40:02.020 --> 40:03.635
- [laughs]

40:03.670 --> 40:05.535
YOUR FAMILY IS INTENSE.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.730
- YOU THINK?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.532
- THAT'S SAYING A LOT,
COMING FROM ME.

40:08.570 --> 40:09.707
- OH, YEAH.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.674
- THANKS FOR STICKING UP
FOR ME.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.948
I KNOW
THAT WASN'T EASY.

40:15.990 --> 40:18.754
- YEAH, WELL,
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD 'EM THE TRUTH

40:18.790 --> 40:20.678
A LONG TIME AGO,
YOU KNOW.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.479
- FEELING ON THE VERGE

40:26.520 --> 40:28.693
- I THINK JABBAR HAD
A GOOD BIRTHDAY PARTY.

40:28.730 --> 40:30.618
- YEAH.
DID YOU NOTICE

40:30.660 --> 40:32.480
THAT HE HAD THREE PIECES
OF CAKE?

40:32.530 --> 40:35.499
- DID YOU NOTICE THAT HE WENT
INTO A WEIRD LITTLE SUGAR COMA

40:35.530 --> 40:37.521
AT ONE POINT
ON THE THIRD SLICE

40:37.570 --> 40:39.538
WITH, LIKE,
DROOL COMING DOWN

40:39.570 --> 40:41.629
MIXED WITH THE BLUE DYE?
- YES, I NOTICED THAT.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.432
HE'S VERY CUTE,
OUR SON.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.744
- I THINK
I'M FALLING IN LOVE.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.755
WITH JABBAR.
- OH.

40:52.790 --> 40:54.200
- IT'S OKAY.
- GOOD.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.923
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.
- YEAH.

40:55.970 --> 40:57.130
- YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU SAW A GHOST.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.889
- GOOD. I WAS WORRIED
FOR A SECOND.

41:03.730 --> 41:08.178
UM, WHY DON'T YOU...

41:08.220 --> 41:10.666
WHY DON'T YOU COME JOIN ME
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

41:14.090 --> 41:16.877
- I CAN HARDLY LEAVE
MY ROOM

41:16.920 --> 41:17.909
- OKAY.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.235
- I TOLD DAMIEN
TO GO BACK.

41:24.270 --> 41:26.545
IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

41:26.580 --> 41:31.165
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

41:31.210 --> 41:35.169
- AND I'LL LISTEN
FOR A TUNE

41:38.700 --> 41:42.693
WHEN THE MIND
IS ON THE MOON

41:46.780 --> 41:50.876
AND IF I STUMBLE

41:50.920 --> 41:54.913
AND IF I STALL

41:54.960 --> 41:57.781
AND IF I SLIP NOW

41:57.820 --> 42:01.688
AND IF I SHOULD FALL

42:01.720 --> 42:07.204
AND IF I CAN'T BE

42:07.240 --> 42:10.619
ALL THAT I COULD BE

42:10.660 --> 42:13.720
WILL YOU

42:13.770 --> 42:16.318
WILL YOU WAIT

42:16.360 --> 42:18.521
FOR ME
