WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:06.006
(trippy music)

00:11.011 --> 00:12.580
- [Voiceover] John
Griggs heard about this

00:12.680 --> 00:16.817
movie producer up in LA
that had a stash of LSD.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.653
- [Voiceover] It was,
like, $35 to $50 a hit

00:19.753 --> 00:25.593
and that was just more
than anybody could afford.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.130
John decided him and
his friends were gonna

00:29.230 --> 00:34.168
rob the house where the
LSD was in Hollywood.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.806
- [Voiceover] They took
guns and went up there

00:38.906 --> 00:41.942
and held this guy
up and took his LSD.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.978
And they go into Orange
County and they took it,

00:45.079 --> 00:48.516
and they had deep,
spiritual revelations.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.085
They took a lot.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.553
- When John took LSD,

00:52.653 --> 00:54.688
it totally turned him around.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.624
Actually, his first time,

00:56.724 --> 00:58.292
he just started
running and running.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.993
And he said he just
had to get home

01:00.094 --> 01:02.830
to tell me how much he loved me.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.232
By the time he got home,

01:04.331 --> 01:05.866
it was about three
in the morning.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.136
He was completely out of breath

01:08.236 --> 01:11.839
and just, his eyes
were wide and crazy.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.842
He just had to tell me how
much love he was feeling.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.811
It just pumped and
flowed through him

01:17.911 --> 01:21.349
and he said he could feel
divinity flowin' through him

01:21.449 --> 01:24.518
as he ran, you know, and
he had been going totally

01:24.618 --> 01:26.654
in the wrong direction in life.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.690
You hadn't heard any stories
like this before, you know?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.226
It just, this was a
new one, you know?

01:32.326 --> 01:34.928
This was a new one for
planet Earth, you know?

01:35.028 --> 01:39.833
The wake-up call.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.837
- LSD was the kind of
thing that changed people,

01:43.937 --> 01:46.740
one at a time, individually.

01:48.776 --> 01:53.581
I graduated from
high school in 1962.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.249
I went to college,

01:55.349 --> 01:59.587
thought I would be a
businessman of some kind

01:59.687 --> 02:02.856
and then LSD came along
while I was in college

02:02.956 --> 02:05.092
and that changed everything.

02:05.193 --> 02:08.262
That changed everything.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.732
I started taking
philosophy classes

02:11.832 --> 02:15.035
and classes on religion.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.805
- Michael was John's friend.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.575
Psychedelics is what
brought them together.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.478
They became tripping buddies.

02:24.578 --> 02:25.946
- I knew there
was something else

02:26.046 --> 02:29.717
in this whole acid
experience that I needed

02:29.817 --> 02:32.953
to understand more
and more and more.

02:33.053 --> 02:36.224
* When I die and
they let me to rest

02:36.324 --> 02:39.793
* Gonna go to the
place that's the best *

02:39.893 --> 02:43.764
- I started smuggling
pot in, actually in '64,

02:43.864 --> 02:46.600
before I ever took psychedelics.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.302
At that time I was
building surfboards

02:48.402 --> 02:50.671
at a surfboard shop
in Laguna Canyon,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.240
but I also
supplemented my income

02:52.340 --> 02:55.843
by dealing a little weed.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.313
If you knew us, we were
polimen, spiritual warriors.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.482
If you didn't know us, we
were a bunch of drug dealers.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.116
You know, we were both.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.685
- [Voiceover] The
international business

03:04.785 --> 03:06.287
and the risks that we took.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.423
Not only risks of getting
locked up indefinitely

03:09.523 --> 03:11.325
in some foreign
country where they just

03:11.425 --> 03:13.461
throw the key away and
forget you're there,

03:13.561 --> 03:15.929
but there was people
killed in those days

03:16.029 --> 03:17.465
for possession of hash

03:17.565 --> 03:18.766
and there we were, you know,

03:18.866 --> 03:22.169
smuggling LSD and
hash and marijuana.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.839
So, we could have
easily been executed

03:25.939 --> 03:30.077
and we knew it, and
we did it anyway.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.779
- We were rolling
through tons of karma,

03:31.879 --> 03:34.014
taking that much acid,
smuggling and all that.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.983
We were doing things
nobody else could do.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.451
Other people try to
do that and they died

03:37.551 --> 03:38.852
or ended up in jail.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.521
We had the power to do stuff

03:40.621 --> 03:42.856
and we did it and we
knew it and it worked.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.725
* When you die

03:44.825 --> 03:48.696
* He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

03:48.796 --> 03:52.366
* Going to recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

03:52.466 --> 03:55.869
* That's where you
gonna go when you die

03:55.969 --> 03:58.972
* When you die and
they lay you to rest

03:59.072 --> 04:03.143
* You're gonna go to the
place that's the best *

04:08.181 --> 04:13.287
- 1960, I was 15.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.723
Johnny Grigg's group
from Anaheim was sitting

04:15.823 --> 04:18.358
in their designated
area on the beach

04:18.459 --> 04:23.230
and Garden Grove was
over here, you know?

04:23.331 --> 04:26.266
Johnny turned around
and he just stared at me

04:26.367 --> 04:29.102
for a real long time
and it penetrated me.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.872
That was it, that
was just it for me.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.707
You know they say it's
love at first sight

04:33.807 --> 04:36.043
or it's a lightning
bolt or something.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.947
That is what happened to me.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.949
My girlfriend's all warned
me about him, you know?

04:42.049 --> 04:47.321
That he was kind of a little
bit of a troublemaker.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.223
Johnny asked me if I
would go out with him

04:50.324 --> 04:53.394
and I had known for
months and months

04:53.494 --> 04:56.397
and been already
in love with him.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.400
When he kissed me
I was so shocked,

04:59.500 --> 05:02.035
because he seemed so timid

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
and he was almost afraid.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.073
He says, "I was so
nervous, you know,

05:06.173 --> 05:10.277
"'cause I had everything
banking on that kiss, you know."

05:10.378 --> 05:13.414
It was like, you know,
if it wasn't then,

05:13.514 --> 05:16.450
it wasn't gonna
happen, you know.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.618
And that was it.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.152
From that kiss on.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.422
* I need your love

05:21.522 --> 05:24.324
* I need your love so badly

05:24.425 --> 05:26.427
* Now since I've
learned you wanted

05:26.527 --> 05:28.962
* No one else around me

05:29.062 --> 05:33.000
* Me, your love, and
I'm counting on it all *

05:33.100 --> 05:35.436
- Johnny went to Brigham
Young University.

05:35.536 --> 05:39.106
He had a scholarship
in wrestling there.

05:39.206 --> 05:44.044
When he came back in
May, I got pregnant.

05:44.144 --> 05:49.182
I was my 17th birthday;
my first time out.

05:49.282 --> 05:54.221
(chuckling) Happy birthday!

05:54.321 --> 05:57.991
My parents and John's
parents took us to Las Vegas

05:58.091 --> 06:01.294
because they had to sign
for me 'cause I was only 17

06:01.395 --> 06:04.097
and we got married there.

06:04.197 --> 06:09.102
We were totally in love
so it didn't matter.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.305
Johnny and I bought a
house in Fountain Valley

06:12.406 --> 06:14.274
with our little family.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.776
It was a cul-de-sac.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.210
My kids could go to school.

06:17.310 --> 06:23.083
I thought it was everything
I wanted in life.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.953
Well, I was just against
all drugs, you know?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.387
I just never did a drug.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.724
I never smoked pot
or did anything.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.962
John was taking LSD and he
was doing it in my house

06:35.062 --> 06:40.067
and I thought it was a little
crazy, but I was young.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.703
Johnny would select a
few of his close friends

06:42.803 --> 06:46.540
that he wanted to experience
that and who were open.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.841
They were tripping inside

06:47.941 --> 06:49.009
and then they went
out into nature

06:49.109 --> 06:50.911
to the beaches, and surfing

06:51.011 --> 06:54.214
and John was turning on 24/7

06:54.314 --> 06:58.118
and for about nine months before

06:58.218 --> 07:02.289
they decided I needed
to join the club.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.828
Him and his friends took me out,

07:07.928 --> 07:11.264
took me down, maybe, you
know, with breakfast;

07:11.364 --> 07:17.971
scrambled eggs and it
was in the orange juice.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.208
Man, the whole universe
came down on me.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.012
I experienced deep within
and I didn't want this

07:25.112 --> 07:27.114
two-story Fountain Valley house

07:27.214 --> 07:30.584
that I thought was everything
I wanted in life, you know?

07:30.684 --> 07:34.187
This little stray piece
of land here and fit in

07:34.287 --> 07:38.425
and that night, I didn't
want any of it, you know?

07:38.526 --> 07:40.027
I didn't want any of it.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.195
I just wanted to
move to the country

07:42.295 --> 07:48.168
and be my own special
self whatever that was.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.237
- Well, the experiences
you have when you take LSD

07:50.337 --> 07:54.241
is a, is a sense of
being in communion

07:54.341 --> 07:55.743
with powers greater
than yourself

07:55.843 --> 07:59.146
and intelligence which far
outstretch the human mind

07:59.246 --> 08:02.115
and energies which
are very ancient.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.984
- Johnny have read this article

08:04.084 --> 08:07.487
in Life Magazine about
these Harvard professors

08:07.588 --> 08:10.257
who were experimenting with LSD.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.892
- Our aim, like the aims

08:11.992 --> 08:14.294
of any religious
group just beginning,

08:14.394 --> 08:16.797
is to transform
American society.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.666
I'm sure many of
your viewers know

08:18.766 --> 08:21.935
that American today
is an insane asylum.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.271
The American people
are completely hung up

08:24.371 --> 08:27.975
on material acquisition,
on power, on war-making,

08:28.075 --> 08:29.943
it's an insane asylum over here.

08:30.043 --> 08:33.179
And it's our goal to
lift the spiritual level

08:33.280 --> 08:34.748
of the American people.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.517
We're gonna try to bring
about a religious renaissance

08:37.618 --> 08:40.352
and a spiritual revolution.

08:40.453 --> 08:44.625
- Timothy Leary was very
much a spiritual being.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.326
He had written a Tao Te Ching,

08:46.426 --> 08:48.161
and Psychedelic Experience.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.697
He was trippin'.

08:49.797 --> 08:53.500
You know, I mean this is the
head honcho, the high priest.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.436
Johnny went to
Millbrook and met him,

08:56.536 --> 08:57.705
and then they talked,

08:57.805 --> 09:00.808
and Johnny brought back
books and information,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.276
and then we had more printed.

09:03.376 --> 09:08.281
We had lived in Fountain Valley
'bout 10 months to a year

09:08.381 --> 09:10.017
and you know we
had a down payment

09:10.117 --> 09:12.720
and making our payments
on this thing, you know.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.488
And I just walked up
to the main office,

09:15.589 --> 09:17.658
and I gave him my
keys and I told him

09:17.758 --> 09:19.660
we were giving the house back.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.161
They said, "What,
we can't do that."

09:21.261 --> 09:23.196
I said, "Yeah we can,
we don't want it.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.298
"It's yours, sell it, resell
it, we don't want it."

09:25.398 --> 09:28.201
(classical guitar)

09:28.301 --> 09:30.070
- [Michael R.] We
realized that we were

09:30.170 --> 09:32.505
a group of sort of bonded people

09:32.606 --> 09:37.645
and we found this old
church in Modjeska Canyon;

09:37.745 --> 09:44.151
beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful little canyon

09:44.251 --> 09:47.254
- [Carol] We moved to
Modjeska Canyon as a group

09:47.354 --> 09:50.390
from our individual
dwellings in Anaheim,

09:50.490 --> 09:53.526
Long Beach, and Garden Grove.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.562
- [Voiceover] The first time
I went to Modjeska Canyon

09:55.663 --> 09:57.064
it felt spiritual.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.801
It felt religious in a way.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.703
- The goal of the
group at that time

10:02.803 --> 10:07.507
was your personal enlightenment,
changing yourself.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.877
You know, we all started
reading spiritual books

10:09.977 --> 10:11.278
and philosophies.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.246
Most of us didn't
know anything among,

10:13.346 --> 10:15.716
I was raised pretty
much without religion.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.018
I was pretty much an atheist,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.020
'til I started
taking psychedelics.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.324
(trippy music)

10:24.424 --> 10:27.360
- [Carol] In the beginning
we relied a lot on holy men,

10:27.460 --> 10:31.832
like Yogananda
Ramakrishna and Ram Dass.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.067
We had a Zen master for a while.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.469
You know, we searched
around to find

10:36.569 --> 10:40.741
people that could explain
the mystery to us.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.211
* The seed doesn't fall

10:44.311 --> 10:47.247
(trippy music)

10:49.000 --> 10:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:58.391 --> 11:00.227
- [Carol] Each time we took LSD

11:00.327 --> 11:02.730
we woke up a little bit
more, and a little bit more,

11:02.830 --> 11:07.000
and we surrendered to that
process and to that light.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.802
- John Griggs' dream
was to give LSD

11:08.902 --> 11:11.104
to everybody, change the world.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.007
Hopefully everybody can
see what we were seeing.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.243
- [Michael R.] There was always
this tension in the world

11:16.343 --> 11:18.979
that just seemed like
would probably go away

11:19.079 --> 11:23.083
if everybody took a dose of
acid, is what we thought.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.685
That's when we decided
to form a church.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.722
(trippy rock music)

11:35.595 --> 11:37.931
- [Travis] We had one of
our meetings, one of our,

11:38.031 --> 11:39.833
I think it was a
Wednesday night meeting,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.034
and John was trying to come up

11:41.134 --> 11:42.836
with a name for the group.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.337
- [Carol] Dwight
Buckley said something

11:44.437 --> 11:46.473
like "The Brotherhood".

11:46.573 --> 11:50.010
And somebody said "Well,
the Brotherhood of what?"

11:50.110 --> 11:51.779
And then Chuck Mendell said--

11:51.879 --> 11:53.180
- The Brotherhood
of Eternal Love--

11:53.280 --> 11:54.514
- The Brotherhood
of Eternal Love.

11:54.614 --> 12:01.388
- The Brotherhood of
Eternal Love and it stuck.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.124
* We are the brothers here

12:04.224 --> 12:06.726
* And they can't
take that away *

12:06.827 --> 12:10.530
- The idea was that each
one of those, say 12 people

12:10.630 --> 12:13.500
would go out and
have 10 or 12 people,

12:13.600 --> 12:17.237
and show them how
this, how this works.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.307
- Everybody you know, go
out and tell everybody,

12:20.407 --> 12:22.976
your workplace, your school,
your family, anybody.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.311
Get 'em to take LSD with you.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.979
- The obvious thing was,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.015
we need to know how
to make as much acid

12:28.115 --> 12:33.420
and get it to as many
people as we possibly can.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.155
* I love it

12:35.255 --> 12:37.557
- We felt it was our duty
to turn the world on.

12:37.657 --> 12:41.228
We really, really, truly
believe that it is our mission

12:41.328 --> 12:42.996
- We were called
upon to do this.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.697
it felt like that to all of us.

12:44.798 --> 12:51.404
we said, "this is something,
this is what I have to do."

12:51.504 --> 12:54.574
- [Carol] LSD was much
more expensive then.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.344
Say, that's hence where
all the hash scams

12:57.444 --> 13:03.350
and the weed scams came through.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.285
- Almost everyone

13:05.385 --> 13:07.220
was doing a scam.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.356
By a scam, we mean an operation,

13:09.456 --> 13:12.525
some sort of
smuggling operation.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.361
When it came down
to the real business

13:14.461 --> 13:16.429
of making this into
a big business,

13:16.529 --> 13:18.265
I was the guy to do that.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.034
- Michael started working
very closely with Johnny,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.203
was his kind of right-hand man

13:23.303 --> 13:24.972
- John and I were best friends.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.406
That's how I became his partner.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.641
I think like he does.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.643
I was one of the
ground-floor investors

13:30.743 --> 13:33.613
in a scam where we
were a movie company.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.548
In those days, everything
was big, you know.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.985
And only had film
canisters and the idea was

13:38.085 --> 13:40.553
to fill the film
canisters with LSD,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.390
and you can't open them
or you expose the film.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.626
* I feel this rust
I'm in so bad *

13:46.726 --> 13:48.228
- I was the hash guy.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.163
Hash was my thing.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.632
- Travis inspired me because
he was always a go-getter,

13:52.732 --> 13:55.002
and he still is to this day.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.004
Perales used to buy
weed in Tijuana,

13:57.104 --> 13:59.139
walk it up to the
border, leave it,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.474
and go through Tijuana, go and
pick it up and drive it home.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.676
And he did that when
he was 17 years old.

14:03.776 --> 14:07.080
* I can't get your love,
I can't get affection *

14:07.180 --> 14:09.649
- [Voiceover] Ron, my older
brother is a pretty smart guy,

14:09.749 --> 14:11.952
engineer kind of mind, you know.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.421
He can build things,
design things.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.755
He's very handy.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.457
- You know they always
called me Poindexter,

14:17.557 --> 14:18.825
because I am really smart,

14:18.926 --> 14:19.927
but book smart.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.361
I'm street-stupid.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.997
You can ask Travis,
(laughs) he'll tell you.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.167
I took on the building of the
vehicles kind of as a job,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.536
but, it was real interesting

14:29.636 --> 14:35.442
to figure out where
to put the hash.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.110
- Carol was the queen mother,

14:37.210 --> 14:39.446
and all the other
wives looked to Carol.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.548
She was just like all
of us looked to John.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.016
- It was always 50-50.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.618
The women, we all did our share.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.954
We worked hard.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.056
Women made everything
legitimate.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.491
You wanted a woman in the
car with you, you know,

14:51.591 --> 14:54.361
not a couple of
shady looking guys.

14:54.461 --> 14:58.631
* I need you girl by my side

14:58.731 --> 15:00.500
- [Carol] John was the magician.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.835
He made it happen.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.005
We would get a huge
load of something,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.539
and he would be instrumental

15:06.639 --> 15:09.676
in making sure it got to York,

15:09.776 --> 15:11.744
and who it went out to,

15:11.844 --> 15:13.480
and who it hooked up to,

15:13.580 --> 15:16.549
and he was a business
man, kind of.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.585
- [Voiceover] Johnny
was sort of the hub,

15:18.685 --> 15:23.056
and this group was
growing around him.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.258
- [Michael R.] I
found in most cases

15:25.358 --> 15:27.494
people that you're going
to dangerous things with

15:27.594 --> 15:28.895
and break the law,

15:28.996 --> 15:30.597
you better be close friends.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.933
You better be sure that
you got each other's back.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.703
- You know, a goal was
not the drug business,

15:36.803 --> 15:38.571
it just morphed
into this, you know,

15:38.671 --> 15:39.939
it went from a group,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.609
a handful of guys seeking
spiritual enlightenment,

15:42.709 --> 15:45.212
to next thing you know,
we were smuggling.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.579
- First it started
off small things,

15:46.679 --> 15:49.349
but then the loads kept
getting bigger, bigger,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.585
which was more revenue.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.088
The money for the
LSD all went back in

15:55.188 --> 15:56.589
to make more to make it cheaper,

15:56.689 --> 15:59.292
give it away for almost nothing.

15:59.392 --> 16:06.333
(funky music)

16:06.433 --> 16:09.536
- People on the east coast
pay like five times more money

16:09.636 --> 16:12.572
than we do on the west
coast for marijuana,

16:12.672 --> 16:14.474
so however you
get it back there,

16:14.574 --> 16:19.379
you can make quite
a bit of money.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.414
Used to be able to
go to the airport

16:21.514 --> 16:24.917
and say, "Hi my name is"
whatever name you want.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.588
Go on a one way ticket,
take a large suitcase,

16:28.688 --> 16:30.123
fill it with weed.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.093
Check it into baggage on the
airplane, fly it to New York.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.661
You could do that.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.663
- [Ron] At this time, you
could get on a plane anywhere,

16:36.763 --> 16:39.332
and whatever you had
on your body was fine.

16:48.041 --> 16:52.445
- All the Afghani hash was
known as Primo, Afghani Primo.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.082
One of my reasons for
exploring the hash business

16:55.182 --> 16:56.849
was I loved it so much,

16:56.949 --> 16:58.318
but it was so expensive.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.087
I mean you pretty much
had to be a dealer

17:00.187 --> 17:01.788
to be able to afford to use it,

17:01.888 --> 17:03.756
so I wanted to make it cheaper.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.025
(dramatic music)

17:06.126 --> 17:07.294
I just started doing
a little research

17:07.394 --> 17:08.661
on where they had hash,

17:08.761 --> 17:11.598
figured it out and
decided to go do a ...

17:11.698 --> 17:13.200
I got Ricky Bevells
to go with me

17:13.300 --> 17:15.602
and we flew to Europe,

17:15.702 --> 17:19.539
clean cut, corduroy sport
jackets, and short hair.

17:19.638 --> 17:20.839
- [Voiceover] We decided
we'd go to Germany

17:20.940 --> 17:26.713
and buy a car, and
drive to Nepal.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.282
Since we both had hid
cars with door panels

17:29.382 --> 17:30.483
from Mexico and everything,

17:30.583 --> 17:32.185
we thought okay,
well we'll get a car,

17:32.285 --> 17:34.521
score and fill it
up, and ship it home.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.656
We had no idea
where we were going,

17:36.756 --> 17:39.226
or what we were
going to encounter.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.794
- We picked up a couple
hippies that were hitchhiking.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.130
It was a guy and a girl.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.365
So, we started smoking
with these hippies,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.134
and one thing came to another,

17:47.234 --> 17:48.668
and they figured out
we were coming there

17:48.768 --> 17:49.902
to get some hash.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.471
So the guys says,
"You know what, man?"

17:51.571 --> 17:54.841
He says, "You wanna
go to Afghanistan."

17:54.941 --> 17:57.009
And I said, "Where the
heck, where's that?"

17:57.110 --> 17:59.011
I had never heard of that.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.181
He says, "They got the best
hash in the world there,

18:01.281 --> 18:02.982
"and it's only four
dollars a kilo."

18:03.082 --> 18:04.717
I said, "When do we leave, man?"

18:04.817 --> 18:08.988
And the next morning, man,
we headed for Afghanistan.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.590
- [Voiceover] We
were very young,

18:10.690 --> 18:14.727
and not very fearful of
hardly anything, actually.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.196
We weren't two kids,

18:16.296 --> 18:19.232
like you think of a 19
year old and a 20 year old.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.600
It was different than that,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.602
because we had been weekly

18:22.702 --> 18:26.806
tapping into this
self that is eternal.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.208
And we knew that.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.878
So, we were like, old
souls in young bodies

18:31.978 --> 18:36.449
going over to do this deed.

18:36.549 --> 18:37.750
- When we first got there,

18:37.850 --> 18:39.186
we were standing in
line at this fruit stand

18:39.286 --> 18:40.720
to buy some fruit,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.755
when this guy comes
walking across the square,

18:42.855 --> 18:43.956
looking right at us.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.092
And I see kind of a guy
in a turban, you know,

18:46.193 --> 18:47.694
and he comes right
up to us and goes,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.630
"Would you guys like to
buy some fine Afghan shit?"

18:50.730 --> 18:52.532
I said, "What kind of
shit you got, man?"

18:52.632 --> 18:55.602
He said, "Well, I
got cocaine, hashish,

18:55.702 --> 18:58.205
"morphine, opium."

18:58.305 --> 19:02.975
I go, "Well, that
hash sounds good."

19:03.075 --> 19:04.911
We'd gone on this
trip originally

19:05.011 --> 19:06.813
planning on trying
to get 10 kilos.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.881
22 pounds, that was our goal.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.051
We ended up buying 50
kilos from these guys.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.788
This is Ayatoolah and
Nazareem, two po-ki brothers.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.424
So, we had all this hash,

19:17.524 --> 19:19.459
We were gonna figure out, how
are we gonna get this home?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.928
So, we started
going to the bazaar,

19:22.028 --> 19:23.996
looking at antiques and stuff.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.065
And things were so
ridiculously cheap.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.901
We found all these beautiful
antique musical instruments,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.471
drums, and like tablas,

19:31.571 --> 19:35.007
and stringed instruments
like tambouras.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.644
We just bought a bunch of it
and we packed it with hash.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.745
You could pack the neck.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.147
You could line the body of it.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.849
- [Voiceover] We saw
it in the news paper,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.852
that they had executed
a Canadian guy

19:45.952 --> 19:48.288
for possession of a very
small amount of hash.

19:48.388 --> 19:52.325
So, we didn't realize we
were risking our lives.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.327
- So, I'm sitting out in Pomona.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.629
Travis and Rick, he
called me from Europe.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.832
And they proceed to tell me
that they sent me a shipment,

19:59.932 --> 20:01.634
and the hash is in
it and it's coming,

20:01.734 --> 20:03.803
and I have to go pick it
up from the LA Customs.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.438
Why'd they send it to me?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.607
I didn't tell them they
could send that to me.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.342
Why the fuck did
they send that to me?

20:09.442 --> 20:12.111
Why didn't they
send it to themself.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.046
So, I go to the
airport, pick this up.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.616
Well, they had sent animal skins

20:16.716 --> 20:19.286
with all the instruments that
they packed the hash into.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.487
They hassled me about the skins.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.621
They said, "You can't
import these skins.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.022
"What are you guys doin'?"

20:23.122 --> 20:24.524
And I'm standing there with
these two customs agents

20:24.624 --> 20:26.726
for hours when they've got
this stuff all over the floor.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.227
- [Voiceover] It wasn't
over till it was over.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.331
So, until Ron had cleared
it, we were all ahead.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.400
I was worried about my
brother getting busted.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.867
Ron was worried
about getting busted.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.305
Trav was probably worried
that we'd lose everything.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.808
- And the one guy picks
up the one wooden tabla,

20:41.908 --> 20:44.711
the drum, and he says,
"This thing's heavy.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.746
"He says, it must
be solid wood."

20:46.846 --> 20:48.981
And other customs agents
picks up another one,

20:49.081 --> 20:51.818
and said, "Yeah, and I
suppose this is solid metal."

20:51.918 --> 20:53.553
And they're looking
at each other.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.221
And I'm just standing there.

20:55.322 --> 20:59.592
They said, okay, you can go.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.894
- So, we showed up
with 88 pounds of hash

21:01.994 --> 21:03.830
that nobody even knew
that hash was like that.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.897
It was so good,
so different

21:04.997 --> 21:06.699
than anything we'd
ever seen before.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.835
There's, it's the best
hash in the world.

21:08.935 --> 21:12.672
(serene music)

21:12.772 --> 21:16.609
- I'm in Ann Arbor
at a college commune,

21:16.709 --> 21:18.978
and I walk in,

21:19.078 --> 21:24.617
and this wonderful
aroma wharfs past me,

21:24.717 --> 21:27.920
and it was almost like
a moment, you know,

21:28.020 --> 21:29.856
that I really, to this day,

21:29.956 --> 21:31.724
I mean how many
years ago was that?

21:31.824 --> 21:34.694
45 or something, 50 years ago,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.863
and I'm still thinking
of when I think of it.

21:36.963 --> 21:40.533
It really is a moment of wow.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.868
And I said, "This
stuff's really good.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.102
"Where'd you get it?"

21:43.202 --> 21:44.771
And he said,

21:44.871 --> 21:47.974
"These people called The
Brotherhood bring it in."

21:48.074 --> 21:51.411
And I said, "There's people
called The Brotherhood?"

21:51.511 --> 21:55.081
(laughs) And I said,
"Well, that sounds cool."

21:55.181 --> 21:56.949
- [Voiceover] People were
associating this hash

21:57.049 --> 21:59.285
from Afghanistan
with the Brotherhood,

21:59.386 --> 22:00.920
because we were the
ones that had it.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.823
And the name Brotherhood
probably went along with it.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.224
It was dealt in pounds.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.893
Then it was dealt in ounces.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.562
Then it was dealt
in grams, you know.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.998
- Everybody had to have some,

22:12.098 --> 22:15.435
and then of course that just
set everyone to thinking,

22:15.535 --> 22:20.206
we can do this, you know?

22:20.306 --> 22:24.977
John and I had started to
pursue the idea of providing

22:25.077 --> 22:28.981
massive amounts of LSD,
as much acid as we could.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.083
- [Voiceover] We went
through a number phases

22:31.183 --> 22:33.920
where we got different
types of LSD.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.356
There was 7th Chakra
Lavendar, Blue Levis.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.026
There was Red Tab.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.128
- Ram Dass, who was
Richard Alpert's said,

22:42.228 --> 22:43.496
"You guys need a center.

22:43.596 --> 22:47.700
"You need a place to
explain how you're

22:47.800 --> 22:48.768
"surviving."

22:48.868 --> 22:50.937
Because now we're selling acid.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.606
* Pack too much baby

22:53.706 --> 22:54.974
* Say you'll be my girl

22:55.074 --> 22:58.144
- [Michael R.] So, we
went to Laguna Beach.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.414
It was an artist colony.

23:01.514 --> 23:05.317
It was the most liberal of
places in Orange County.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.186
Who doesn't like the beach?

23:07.286 --> 23:09.656
* Back again let me in

23:09.756 --> 23:11.991
* The war is over
where you been *

23:12.091 --> 23:14.326
- Johnny and I started
immediately talking

23:14.427 --> 23:16.395
that a bookstore,

23:16.496 --> 23:17.997
a metaphysical bookstore,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.199
that's what we were gonna do.

23:20.299 --> 23:24.403
And we then found the place
on Pacific Coast Highway

23:24.504 --> 23:27.173
that was just way bigger
than a bookstore place,

23:27.273 --> 23:28.407
but it looked perfect

23:28.508 --> 23:30.810
and the whole thing
just expanded out like,

23:30.910 --> 23:32.011
"Well, hell let's

23:32.111 --> 23:34.046
"put a bookstore here
and other stores there."

23:34.146 --> 23:36.148
It became a bigger vision.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.919
- And that way we
could be creative and

23:40.019 --> 23:42.021
more hide what we were doing.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.691
* Walk right by
the old news baby *

23:44.791 --> 23:46.893
- A clothing store,
handmade clothing,

23:46.993 --> 23:50.162
there was a bead
store, art gallery,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.064
a health food juice bar,

23:52.164 --> 23:54.066
and we called it
Mystic Arts World.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.668
And it was a hit,

23:55.768 --> 23:58.004
and the place started
making money from day one.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.172
* Hey hey hey hey

24:00.272 --> 24:02.709
* No no no no

24:02.809 --> 24:05.512
- [Michael R.] The
Los Angeles Times said

24:05.612 --> 24:08.881
that, "Mystic Arts World
was the finest gallery

24:08.981 --> 24:10.917
"in southern California."

24:11.017 --> 24:12.852
There was nothing
like it around.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.854
There has never been
anything like it around.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.591
It was a psychedelic emporium.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.126
- [Travis] Mystic
Arts became the center

24:20.226 --> 24:21.127
for southern California

24:21.227 --> 24:22.361
for the hippie movement,

24:22.461 --> 24:23.630
and the psychedelic movement,

24:23.730 --> 24:25.231
the spiritual movement,

24:25.331 --> 24:27.033
and Laguna became the
town everyone flocked to.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.869
It was like Haight
Ashbury south.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.138
And we ended calling
the place Dodge City,

24:32.238 --> 24:34.106
because of everybody
was dealing pot,

24:34.206 --> 24:35.875
and psychedelics, and just,

24:35.975 --> 24:40.613
I mean, it became the place.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.549
- [Carol] There was no
law there, you know.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.050
It was the wild west,

24:44.150 --> 24:45.217
and a new frontier.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.253
You know, it was
our own community.

24:47.353 --> 24:48.921
- [Michael R.] It
was like the Shire,

24:49.021 --> 24:53.660
this beautiful idyllic
little weird community.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.261
- [Voiceover] You could
just go out on the street,

24:55.361 --> 24:56.395
and you'd run into
somebody you knew,

24:56.495 --> 24:57.997
and have a conversation,

24:58.097 --> 24:59.932
or go over to their house
and smoke a joint with them,

25:00.032 --> 25:01.734
or get some waves, go surfing.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.271
It was all so relaxed
and sort of utopia.

25:05.371 --> 25:08.274
- [Carol] Johnny used to
love to take acid and surf.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.142
That was their whole thing.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.644
That's what got 'em all goin'.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.981
A lot of the surfers, they
called it Christ in the curl.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.117
- You had surfers meeting
with all the hippies

25:18.217 --> 25:19.518
and everybody smoked weed.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.920
Everybody took acid.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.055
Everybody did.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.324
- [Carol] Chuch Wendell
had brought Mike Hynson

25:25.424 --> 25:28.360
out to the canyon to meet us.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.196
- Mike Hynson was
the best surfer

25:30.296 --> 25:32.431
in the world,
practically in the day,

25:32.531 --> 25:36.035
and a movie star, kind of.

25:36.135 --> 25:39.839
His story on black
speech in San Diego once,

25:39.939 --> 25:41.440
we're passing a
joint back and forth,

25:41.540 --> 25:43.042
both high on acid,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.476
and Mike picked up his board,

25:44.577 --> 25:48.147
and he jumps in the water
with the joint still lit,

25:48.247 --> 25:50.016
jumps into this wave,

25:50.116 --> 25:52.051
catches it just perfect,

25:52.151 --> 25:55.287
and he disappeared
inside the curl,

25:55.387 --> 25:56.723
and sitting on the
beach, can't see him.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.390
And all of a sudden
he comes flying out

25:58.490 --> 26:01.527
the back end of the wave
kind of sitting cross-legged

26:01.628 --> 26:03.830
on the back of the surfboard,

26:03.930 --> 26:07.533
and hops off, grabs
the surfboard,

26:07.634 --> 26:13.773
and the joint is still lit.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.843
He said, "That's how you're
supposed to do it, brother."

26:16.943 --> 26:19.612
You know, it was like, my God.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.356
- Selling psychedelics
was a dharmic way to be.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.358
It was a good way
to make a living.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.492
It was honest.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.527
It was a good product.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.997
It was wanted, you know.

26:38.097 --> 26:43.169
The only problem
is it was illegal.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.271
- Because they made it illegal,

26:45.371 --> 26:47.273
it produced commerce.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.075
All the hippies can't
be just smoking weed

26:49.175 --> 26:50.009
and taking LSD.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.011
Someone has to make the money.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.345
Now there was bands.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.681
There was health food stores.

26:54.781 --> 26:55.915
There was record shops,

26:56.015 --> 26:58.250
but the main commerce
came from the LSD,

26:58.350 --> 27:00.186
the marijuana, and the hashish.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.754
From the smugglers
to the ground dealer,

27:01.854 --> 27:03.455
this started a commerce

27:03.555 --> 27:10.262
that allowed the hippie
movement to happen.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.397
- [Carol] The movement

27:11.497 --> 27:13.565
and the name of The Brotherhood

27:13.666 --> 27:15.301
kept getting bigger and bigger.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.404
- And I think a lot of
people realized that

27:18.504 --> 27:21.774
we were gonna be
a major influence

27:21.874 --> 27:24.476
in the psychedelic world.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.884
- I was an attorney.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.486
I had been practicing
for a number of years.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.924
We were representing a lot of
draft resisters at the time

27:38.024 --> 27:40.793
and a lot of drug
dealers at the time.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.829
My basic view of the law was

27:42.929 --> 27:45.297
anybody our
government didn't like

27:45.397 --> 27:46.598
couldn't be all bad.

27:46.699 --> 27:49.501
So, we represented criminals.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.838
We were very
political ourselves,

27:51.938 --> 27:57.176
very proud student activists.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.445
- [Michael R.] I mean,
I think the 60s was

27:59.545 --> 28:02.448
the perfect storm
in so many ways.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.316
With all the
background of people

28:04.416 --> 28:06.819
just getting sick
and tired of racism,

28:06.919 --> 28:10.089
women wanting to be
treated more equally

28:10.189 --> 28:11.924
in society and they weren't.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.793
- [Carol] It was
during the Vietnam War.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.328
You know, nobody wanted
to go fight the war.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.296
Nobody wanted to do that.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.165
It was all about peace and love.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.367
- You had the marches going on.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.435
They know it was,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.437
a lot of turmoil.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.639
- Great steps forward often come

28:27.740 --> 28:30.542
from a surprising stimulus.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.946
Psychedelics was just the
catalyst you drop into it,

28:34.046 --> 28:37.817
and it all started to
gel and come together.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.351
People just said,

28:39.451 --> 28:41.387
"We're not gonna put
up with this anymore.

28:41.487 --> 28:46.092
"This isn't right,
and so we rebuild."

28:46.192 --> 28:50.696
(upbeat music)

28:50.797 --> 28:53.032
We were there for
the Berkeley riots.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.234
- [Voiceover] 400 police
officers moved skirmish lines

28:55.334 --> 28:56.535
through the area.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.337
- My beautiful girls
would run around topless,

28:58.437 --> 29:00.672
and give the soldiers flowers,

29:00.773 --> 29:03.242
and sometimes refreshments

29:03.342 --> 29:05.511
that were laced with
acid, of course.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.814
There were times
when we'd go out,

29:07.914 --> 29:11.083
and this roadblock
isn't there anymore.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.186
All the guards are layin'
on the lawns of the houses,

29:14.286 --> 29:15.554
in their uniform,

29:15.654 --> 29:18.357
with their stupid looking
old bolt action rifles,

29:18.457 --> 29:19.892
flowers in the stock,

29:19.992 --> 29:22.494
and they're as loaded
as they could be.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.264
There was a time, particularly
in southern California,

29:25.364 --> 29:26.565
where word spread.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.434
It was mostly mythology,

29:28.534 --> 29:32.338
The Brotherhood of Eternal
Love could take a tab of acid,

29:32.438 --> 29:34.240
and with a little
pair of gloves,

29:34.340 --> 29:36.242
they'd put it on your doorknob.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.377
They could put it in
your drinking water.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.346
They could put it everywhere,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
and you didn't even
know it had hit you

29:42.548 --> 29:44.083
until you were stoned
outta your mind,

29:44.183 --> 29:45.584
and wondering, "Whoa!

29:45.684 --> 29:50.022
"Why am I looking into the
face of God all of a sudden?"

29:50.122 --> 29:52.524
- [Voiceover] We were on a
mission to change the world,

29:52.624 --> 29:55.427
and we were doing it by
supplying psychedelics

29:55.527 --> 29:57.263
to help change
people's thinking.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.098
So, it was worth the risk.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.766
- It began a year ago,

30:00.867 --> 30:03.035
when to so-called
free speech advocates,

30:03.135 --> 30:05.471
who in truth have no
appreciation for freedom,

30:05.571 --> 30:07.306
were allowed to
assault and humiliate

30:07.406 --> 30:08.941
the symbol of law and
order of policemen

30:09.041 --> 30:10.209
on the campus.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.477
- What we were doing
became political

30:11.577 --> 30:13.779
because it influenced
so many people.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.382
- This year, I will
propose a drug control act,

30:16.482 --> 30:18.117
to provide stricter penalties

30:18.217 --> 30:21.687
for those who traffic in LSD,

30:21.787 --> 30:25.124
and other dangerous
drugs with our people.

30:25.224 --> 30:28.560
The time has come
to stop the sale

30:28.660 --> 30:30.562
of slavery to the young.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.564
- The war on drugs
was a war on us.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.434
The war on drugs is a
war on psychedelics,

30:35.534 --> 30:37.569
things that they cannot control.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.805
- [Voiceover] 20,000 young
people filled the canyon

30:39.906 --> 30:42.508
outside the resort
town of Laguna Beach.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.944
They came by the thousands
to sleep on the ground,

30:45.044 --> 30:46.612
or in their cars and campers.

30:46.712 --> 30:47.846
- [Voiceover] We were
starting to realize

30:47.947 --> 30:49.615
that more and more
people shared the vision

30:49.715 --> 30:51.483
that we'd had, which was great.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.452
Think, "Oh, yeah,
this is really good.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.653
"You know, it's spreading.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.355
"It's spreading like we
were hoping it would."

30:56.455 --> 30:59.425
- Drugs are just an
everyday part of life here.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.360
It's a special day
that it's really happy

31:01.460 --> 31:06.332
and a lot of people and
a lot of brotherhood.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.001
- I had come to Laguna,

31:09.101 --> 31:11.637
and I wanted to get more hash.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.705
While I was there,
I had met everyone,

31:13.805 --> 31:16.042
and everyone was really nice,

31:16.142 --> 31:19.611
but I was wondering, you know,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.713
where's the Brotherhood?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.282
Who's the Brotherhood?

31:23.382 --> 31:25.884
You know, they were
supposedly the people who,

31:25.985 --> 31:27.886
who get this and I actually,

31:27.987 --> 31:31.357
had kind of paid
for that connection.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.559
So, I wanted to, I wanted,

31:33.659 --> 31:36.062
I didn't want to go
through other people.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.997
- [Voiceover] The rock
lovers keep coming.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.531
They leave their cars and walk.

31:39.631 --> 31:44.803
- The last of '66,
'67, and into '68,

31:44.903 --> 31:48.374
Laguna was like an anthill,

31:48.474 --> 31:51.710
and just, just these hippy-types

31:51.810 --> 31:55.447
just buzzin' around.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.183
I'll never forget my first time

31:57.283 --> 31:58.917
I actually parked there,

31:59.018 --> 32:00.919
and I walked down at sunset.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.554
It was about 7:00 at night,

32:02.654 --> 32:05.257
and I looked out there,

32:05.357 --> 32:07.559
and as far as you
could see both ways,

32:07.659 --> 32:10.396
there was more potheads
down there smokin'

32:10.496 --> 32:13.199
watchin' the sun goin'
down cross-legged,

32:13.299 --> 32:14.566
"Om ...

32:14.666 --> 32:16.768
"Om ..."

32:16.868 --> 32:21.140
And I'm just thinkin',
"You know, nothing.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.675
"I guess this is just
a free wide open place,

32:23.775 --> 32:25.077
"but this is bull.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.512
"Marijuana's a felony.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.514
"All these other
drugs are felonies."

32:28.614 --> 32:30.949
And I'm gonna,

32:31.050 --> 32:33.185
I'm going to make
it my business.

32:38.224 --> 32:41.227
The orders of the police
department at that time was,

32:41.327 --> 32:44.296
we're gonna write as many
tickets as we can write,

32:44.396 --> 32:46.698
and we're gonna make as
many arrests as you can.

32:46.798 --> 32:51.603
That's all there is to it.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.272
- [Voiceover] Well,
we opened up the shop,

32:53.372 --> 32:55.307
and people started
coming from all around,

32:55.407 --> 32:57.576
and hanging out on the
sidewalk in front there,

32:57.676 --> 32:59.978
and smoking pot
and getting busted.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.248
It just slowly sort of built up,

33:02.348 --> 33:03.615
that notoriety,

33:03.715 --> 33:05.284
which brought
people like Purcell

33:05.384 --> 33:07.986
to start trying to
observe us more closely.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.089
You know, from behind
the bushes and stuff,

33:10.189 --> 33:13.725
watching.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.262
- By now, we had a reputation,

33:16.362 --> 33:18.330
that The Brotherhood
can move it,

33:18.430 --> 33:19.598
you know, whatever it is.

33:19.698 --> 33:25.504
If it's good, it's
pure, we can move it.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.139
- [Travis] The cops
used to come in there,

33:27.239 --> 33:29.108
trying to rouse people
and bust people,

33:29.208 --> 33:33.145
and it was just a big
game of cops and robbers.

33:33.245 --> 33:36.182
- Neil Purcell pulls into
Dodge City, you know,

33:36.282 --> 33:40.252
and were smokin' the hooka
at one of the hotels.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.621
He came running in
there all by himself,

33:42.721 --> 33:43.822
"You're all under arrest!"

33:43.922 --> 33:45.457
Somebody pushed him
into the swimming pool

33:45.557 --> 33:46.692
in his uniform,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.360
and we grabbed the hooka
and everybody left.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.861
By the time he got
out of the pool,

33:49.961 --> 33:50.796
nobody was there.

33:50.896 --> 33:53.665
He fucking hated us.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.101
In those days, you know,

33:55.201 --> 33:59.305
most people would really
bow to authority's rule,

33:59.405 --> 34:01.373
but we didn't.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.808
We refused to behave,

34:02.908 --> 34:05.811
or even to pretend to
behave, we refused to.

34:05.911 --> 34:08.013
You know, it was just
like in your face,

34:08.114 --> 34:11.617
"No, we're gonna
be the way we are."

34:11.717 --> 34:13.819
We were gettin' stoned,
we were smokin' dope,

34:13.918 --> 34:17.723
takin' acid, pursuing
a spiritual life.

34:17.822 --> 34:24.230
(dramatic trippy music)

34:24.330 --> 34:27.032
Everything grows organically.

34:27.132 --> 34:30.702
You start selling acid to
10 people, then 100 people,

34:30.802 --> 34:32.371
then thousands of people,

34:32.471 --> 34:36.775
and pretty soon
you have a demand.

34:36.875 --> 34:41.280
These guys Nick, Sam, and Tim
Scully made a bunch of acid.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.186
It was the largest
amount of acid

34:47.286 --> 34:48.853
that was available for sale

34:48.954 --> 34:51.056
that was real, real good,
that we knew of, and so--

34:51.157 --> 34:52.724
- They wanted The Brotherhood
to be the distributors

34:52.824 --> 34:53.925
of the LSD.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.362
Up until that point,
the main distributors

34:56.462 --> 34:58.430
were the Hells Angels.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.332
- [Michael R.] We
wanted the exclusive.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.900
You don't want five
people to have this.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.404
You want one group to have it.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.606
We saw something in each other,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.608
Nick, and I, and Johnny.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.944
And that was it,
we were the guys.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.247
- [Voiceover] So many
miraculous things happened,

35:15.347 --> 35:18.350
that made it possible
to do the things we did.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.954
It feels like there was
divine intervention involved.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.290
- They came up with these bags,

35:24.390 --> 35:27.593
these old bags of yellow tabs,

35:27.693 --> 35:30.262
and orange tabs,

35:30.362 --> 35:32.798
and blue tabs.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.701
For some reason, everyone
liked the orange ones.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.404
- We had it all in
the trunk of this car,

35:38.504 --> 35:39.805
and turned on the radio,

35:39.905 --> 35:41.907
and there was Back
on the Street Again,

35:42.007 --> 35:43.775
by the Sunshine Company.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.445
- And they named
'em Orange Sunshine.

35:46.545 --> 35:52.484
- It became, like
overnight famous.

35:52.584 --> 35:56.121
I remember flying back east
with a small duffle bag

35:56.222 --> 35:59.425
that had baggies
of Orange Sunshine.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.660
And you know, it'd
just take five hours

36:01.760 --> 36:03.795
to get it from the west coast
and it'd be on the east coast

36:03.895 --> 36:05.297
as fast as the plane lands,

36:05.397 --> 36:08.500
and pretty soon the acid
hits the street that night.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.640
Chuck Scott, he
was kind of the one

36:14.740 --> 36:18.310
that got the New York
Market established for us.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.812
And we had people
in Laguna Beach

36:20.912 --> 36:24.850
that sold a lot of
acid on the west coast.

36:24.950 --> 36:25.951
* What'd you take

36:26.051 --> 36:27.085
* Orange Sunshine

36:27.185 --> 36:28.086
* Do you want more

36:28.186 --> 36:29.921
* Yeah yeah

36:30.021 --> 36:31.857
- Orange Sunshine

36:31.957 --> 36:33.825
became synonymous
with The Brotherhood.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.462
- It became a household
name damn quick.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.464
Sunshine was far more popular

36:38.564 --> 36:40.999
than say, Windowpane,
Purple Haze,

36:41.099 --> 36:44.002
or other things
that were around.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.338
- [Michael K.] The Grateful
Dead was always in love

36:46.438 --> 36:47.539
with The Brotherhood,

36:47.639 --> 36:49.608
because although
their music was great,

36:49.708 --> 36:52.944
it was even greater
with Orange Sunshine.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.318
- [Michael R.] People in
Hollywood were interested.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.186
People came from all over.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.289
- Acid, Sunshine?

37:03.389 --> 37:04.990
- It was happening
in San Francisco.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.224
It was happening in Amsterdam,

37:06.325 --> 37:07.826
in England, and Germany.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.961
The kids, all over the world,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.197
got this LSD at the same time.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.033
- [Voiceover] Paul, how
often have you taken LSD?

37:15.133 --> 37:17.035
- About four times.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.070
- [Voiceover] Where
did you get it from?

37:19.170 --> 37:20.171
- Oh, you know, I mean,

37:20.272 --> 37:21.673
if I was to say
where I got it from,

37:21.773 --> 37:22.874
you know it's illegal
and everything,

37:22.974 --> 37:24.843
it's silly to say then.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.912
- It was in every
city there was,

37:27.012 --> 37:28.246
and it had a name,

37:28.347 --> 37:29.915
and you know, the
Orange Sunshine.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.417
- [Voiceover] I took some acid,

37:31.517 --> 37:34.753
and they were these
little orange pills.

37:34.853 --> 37:35.921
- Were they barrel-shaped?

37:36.021 --> 37:37.523
- [Voiceover] Uh, yes.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.725
- Okay, right, you did some
Orange Sunshine, Peter.

37:39.825 --> 37:40.926
(laughing)

37:41.026 --> 37:46.832
(funky music)

37:46.932 --> 37:49.067
- [Michael R.] We
eclipsed everything.

37:49.167 --> 37:54.840
You know, we were
the Coca-Cola of LSD.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.709
- I never sold LSD or
smuggled it to make money.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.445
Ever, I can honestly say that.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.548
- Most of us said, "Hey,
the LSD should be free."

38:02.648 --> 38:04.049
That was John's dream.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.117
John's dream was everybody
did LSD for free.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.087
He said it should be in
gum machines on the corner.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.090
- When more money came in,
it didn't matter to us.

38:12.190 --> 38:15.427
The money just afforded us
to try and make more acid.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.629
Nobody was living
high on the hog,

38:17.729 --> 38:20.432
and had Cadillacs or fancy cars.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.768
I mean, I drove my old pickup.

38:22.868 --> 38:26.972
- People maintained the
same spiritual values.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.107
We just got bigger and we just,

38:29.207 --> 38:32.644
it made the machine
grow in a organic way.

38:32.744 --> 38:36.247
We made a lot of LSD,
a whole lot of it.

38:36.348 --> 38:39.284
(crowd cheering)

38:54.533 --> 38:57.969
- [Carol] At that point, you
could feel the police presence,

38:58.069 --> 39:00.806
snooping around and
asking questions,

39:00.906 --> 39:03.074
and watching people.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.910
- When you add the element
of what we're doing

39:05.010 --> 39:06.311
is very, very risky.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.946
Don't forget the fear part,

39:08.046 --> 39:11.316
and the prayers of "I hope we
don't get caught doin' this,

39:11.417 --> 39:12.951
"'cause this isn't ...

39:13.051 --> 39:15.687
"This isn't a platinum
record we're doing here.

39:15.787 --> 39:19.124
"This is something that could
send you to jail forever."

39:19.224 --> 39:20.826
- Cops, or narcs,

39:20.926 --> 39:23.094
or whoever they who were
would sit out in their cars

39:23.194 --> 39:26.131
and just watch people
coming in and going out.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.933
Trying to figure who's who,

39:28.033 --> 39:32.571
and hook who up to what and ...

39:32.671 --> 39:39.177
Oh good luck.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.212
- The Brotherhood was known more

39:41.312 --> 39:43.615
as a mystical organization.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.451
There were a lot of
people that said,

39:45.551 --> 39:47.819
"It doesn't really
exist, It's not real."

39:47.919 --> 39:49.488
- I never allowed
my picture taken,

39:49.588 --> 39:51.623
so people might know my name,

39:51.723 --> 39:55.126
but they wouldn't know
what I looked like.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.394
- After my first couple,

39:56.495 --> 39:58.163
my first trip or
two to Afghanistan,

39:58.263 --> 40:01.232
I decided we should probably
start getting fake ID.

40:01.332 --> 40:05.370
And, it was really
easy in those days.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.976
- [Michael R.] We had blank
Social Security cards,

40:11.076 --> 40:12.143
so you could fill in a number

40:12.243 --> 40:13.979
on the Social Security
card if you want.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.647
And what you do with
the birth certificate,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.516
is you could erase everything
on the birth certificate

40:17.616 --> 40:19.551
and put in other numbers
and make a copy of it,

40:19.651 --> 40:20.986
and then kind of
make it official.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.721
Put a stamp in there
and then emboss it,

40:22.821 --> 40:24.322
and it worked.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.991
- [Voiceover] The
idea was to travel

40:26.091 --> 40:27.325
under a fictitious name

40:27.425 --> 40:28.894
in case something happened
in a foreign country,

40:28.994 --> 40:30.829
and you could pay your
way out over there,

40:30.929 --> 40:32.931
so it wouldn't
reverberate back here

40:33.031 --> 40:34.432
and get us in trouble here.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.202
- We were using the
names of dead people

40:37.302 --> 40:39.437
and going and getting passports.

40:39.538 --> 40:43.609
I had four passports of
my own and three fakes.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.010
- I can remember going up to LA

40:45.110 --> 40:47.679
to the Passport Bureau one time,

40:47.779 --> 40:49.080
and I changed my appearance.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.116
I got some glasses that were
just plain glass though,

40:51.216 --> 40:53.919
stage glasses, and
changed my hair.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.187
I went in there and said, "I
need an expedited passport,

40:56.287 --> 40:57.623
"I'm leaving tomorrow."

40:57.723 --> 40:59.357
For an extra 20 bucks, man.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.594
"Okay", (mumbles) walked
out with a passport,

41:02.694 --> 41:04.696
right then, same day.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.365
Went out, went to a hotel room,

41:07.465 --> 41:10.201
changed my appearance,
completely.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.403
Went back the same day,

41:12.504 --> 41:14.105
went in a different cube,

41:14.205 --> 41:15.707
got in a different line,

41:15.807 --> 41:17.142
and got another passport,

41:17.242 --> 41:18.944
in the same office
in the same day,

41:19.044 --> 41:20.145
under two different IDs.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.312
No computers,

41:21.412 --> 41:22.981
there was not cross-referencing.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.115
- So, we were able to function

41:24.215 --> 41:29.020
right under their
nose, basically.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.090
- [Ron] We went on to
smuggle more Afghani hash,

41:32.190 --> 41:33.424
than anybody.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.926
We did big things.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.828
2400 pounds at a time.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.063
We weren't fuckin' around.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.265
We did one and
another and another.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.568
- A couple brothers
would fly to Germany.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.469
Get a car into Afghanistan,

41:44.570 --> 41:46.738
meet up with the
Tilkai brothers,

41:46.838 --> 41:47.839
all this kind of stuff.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.609
Work out a deal,
200, 300, 500 pounds.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.177
After the dope was loaded,

41:52.277 --> 41:54.145
seal, weld 'em all back up,

41:54.245 --> 41:56.114
and maybe have it
shipped to Seattle.

41:56.214 --> 42:00.619
The drive it from Seattle,
Portland down to Laguna.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.120
They were not dummies.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.591
They had some smart
people in there,

42:05.691 --> 42:08.026
but they're all crooks.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.062
(mellow music)

42:31.249 --> 42:35.286
- [Ron] Winter of '67,
Timothy moved to Laguna.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.256
He came out and joined us.

42:38.356 --> 42:40.158
- Tim saw in the brotherhood,

42:40.258 --> 42:43.228
an actualization
of his own dreams,

42:43.328 --> 42:44.796
of his own imagination,

42:44.896 --> 42:46.632
and he loved it,

42:46.732 --> 42:48.533
and they loved him.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.335
- Timothy was a focal point,

42:50.435 --> 42:53.471
a spiritual focal point
that was necessary.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.306
And he was brilliant.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.878
And his spiritual
insight was profound.

42:59.978 --> 43:02.814
You know, John Griggs was
a holy, holy, holy man,

43:02.914 --> 43:06.351
and Timothy had a big
influence on John Griggs,

43:06.451 --> 43:09.988
but John Griggs had a bigger
influence on Timothy Leary.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.257
- [Carol] Timothy Leary
looked up to Johnny

43:12.357 --> 43:14.225
as a spiritual being.

43:14.325 --> 43:17.696
They both had the same
vision and the same dream,

43:17.796 --> 43:22.167
to turn the world on.

43:22.267 --> 43:26.237
The energy was moving so
fast at that particular time.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.373
- It got to a point where it ...

43:28.473 --> 43:32.744
If somebody had some LSD,
or some pot, or some hash,

43:32.844 --> 43:35.080
and they said this was
from The Brotherhood,

43:35.180 --> 43:36.181
that's all they needed to say.

43:36.281 --> 43:40.418
It would be sold quick.

43:40.518 --> 43:42.053
- [Michael R.] It
was starting to slip

43:42.153 --> 43:45.256
into a different gear.

43:45.356 --> 43:47.425
- Dodge City had been
taken over by more hippies,

43:47.525 --> 43:49.895
and rock 'n rollin',

43:49.995 --> 43:53.331
probably crazier than ever.

43:53.431 --> 43:54.465
- [Voiceover] More
and more people

43:54.565 --> 43:56.034
were peripherally
involved with us,

43:56.134 --> 43:57.568
and then you started
hearing people say,

43:57.669 --> 43:58.870
"You know so and so?"

43:58.970 --> 44:00.538
And I'd say, "No, I
don't know that person."

44:00.638 --> 44:02.040
"Well, they're
Brotherhood members."

44:02.140 --> 44:03.742
- It wasn't for
the whole anymore.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.477
It was a group of a
bunch of smugglers

44:06.577 --> 44:07.478
that worked together.

44:07.578 --> 44:08.747
That was a whole 'nother thing.

44:08.847 --> 44:13.218
That's kind of a
business, in a way.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.720
Police were starting to go,

44:14.820 --> 44:18.423
"Oh my God this is getting
out of control, you know?"

44:18.523 --> 44:20.391
They're having big
public meetings

44:20.491 --> 44:23.561
with a few thousand
people showing up.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.896
- [Voiceover] The
game we played before

44:24.996 --> 44:26.131
was just cat and mouse,

44:26.231 --> 44:27.665
and we were always winning.

44:27.766 --> 44:30.668
Things got a little
more serious after that.

44:30.769 --> 44:32.270
- They just wanted
us outta there.

44:32.370 --> 44:37.208
Laguna was tired of
the hippie scene.

44:37.308 --> 44:39.277
- Mystic Arts World was torched

44:39.377 --> 44:41.813
by the elders of Laguna Beach.

44:41.913 --> 44:44.182
They arsoned our store.

44:44.282 --> 44:47.418
They threw a fire bomb
through the fucking sky light,

44:47.518 --> 44:51.156
and it smoke damaged everything.

44:51.256 --> 44:55.260
And it was way too
hard to reopen.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.863
The writing on the wall
was very clear to everyone.

44:57.963 --> 45:02.167
It was probably that
those days were over.

45:02.267 --> 45:05.203
(mellow music)

45:10.608 --> 45:13.278
- [Travis] The spring '68
is when we bought a ranch

45:13.378 --> 45:17.348
in Idyllwild, California
called Fobes Ranch.

45:17.448 --> 45:20.151
It was an experiment
in communal living.

45:20.251 --> 45:22.854
We were trying to find
this ideal lifestyle,

45:22.954 --> 45:24.522
and it was like
everybody contributing,

45:24.622 --> 45:28.359
everybody pitching in,
whatever you can give.

45:28.459 --> 45:29.995
We did everything together.

45:30.095 --> 45:32.463
You know, we cooked
together, ate together,

45:32.563 --> 45:35.033
you know, had our
ceremonies together.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.869
- The whole group, the
whole thing, it was family.

45:37.969 --> 45:41.039
We were all a family.

45:41.139 --> 45:44.509
Family values, that's what
we tried to cultivate,

45:44.609 --> 45:48.613
and that was a lot
of Johnny's goal.

45:48.713 --> 45:51.416
Everyone of my children,
from day one up,

45:51.516 --> 45:54.485
they knew exactly
what was going on.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.856
You know, they were
part of the movement.

45:57.956 --> 46:00.391
If my children were
playing with the

46:00.491 --> 46:02.360
outside of these realms,

46:02.460 --> 46:05.997
they knew not to talk
about what went on,

46:06.097 --> 46:10.635
and they were all very,
I would say, savvy.

46:10.735 --> 46:15.273
They were miniature hippies.

46:15.373 --> 46:20.178
- [Michael R.] The vision
was always to produce LSD,

46:20.278 --> 46:23.348
but once we got to a
certain stage with that,

46:23.448 --> 46:27.552
and Johnny saw I was
able to take care of it,

46:27.652 --> 46:28.887
he moved back.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.522
He wanted to live a
more domestic life,

46:31.622 --> 46:37.195
and I took over for him with
the traveling and all of that.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.730
- I was always trying to
find Michael a girlfriend,

46:39.831 --> 46:43.534
'cause he was a
sincere, neat guy.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.538
- I would have probably
been a lot more peaceful,

46:47.638 --> 46:51.409
if I was just pursuing my
spiritual life at the ranch,

46:51.509 --> 46:57.148
but I was obeying
a higher calling.

46:57.248 --> 46:58.383
We were successful.

46:58.483 --> 47:02.320
We sold everything
and we got to where

47:02.420 --> 47:05.590
we were ready to
take the next step,

47:05.690 --> 47:08.393
which was make more.

47:08.493 --> 47:12.397
So, we bought a house
close to Palm Springs,

47:12.497 --> 47:15.400
and we set up a lab in there.

47:28.446 --> 47:31.616
- Everybody took off to
Afghanistan to do these scams.

47:31.716 --> 47:33.284
Well, we were tired of
doing these Volkswagens

47:33.384 --> 47:35.954
and getting 400, 500
pounds in them, right?

47:36.054 --> 47:38.356
So, we find the finest
motorhome we can,

47:38.456 --> 47:40.591
and I go out to Pomona
and we buy a Lazy Days,

47:40.691 --> 47:42.593
and we get this guy
Al that was in prison,

47:42.693 --> 47:43.929
a Mexican welder,

47:44.029 --> 47:46.297
and he does the car
just like we want.

47:46.397 --> 47:48.199
I put stash places everywhere.

47:48.299 --> 47:52.503
There was probably ten
different places to stash.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.605
We did 1300 pounds in that one.

47:54.705 --> 47:59.177
It was the first big one.

47:59.277 --> 48:03.448
(upbeat hippy music)

48:03.548 --> 48:07.185
- Summer of '68, I went
back to Afghanistan

48:07.285 --> 48:09.921
to get another load.

48:10.021 --> 48:12.057
Mike Henson and David Hall,

48:12.157 --> 48:15.060
they hollowed out a spot
in these two surfboards.

48:15.160 --> 48:20.065
And they could just
pack 'em with hash.

48:20.165 --> 48:21.466
So, I took 'em along.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.034
Strapped 'em to
the top of the VW.

48:23.134 --> 48:25.636
Two surfboards in the
dead of winter in Europe,

48:25.736 --> 48:26.871
drove through the Alps,

48:26.972 --> 48:29.574
and down and across all
the way to Afghanistan.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.342
They were really out of place,

48:31.442 --> 48:33.044
and I had a wife and
a little kid with me,

48:33.144 --> 48:35.546
a little girl with me.

48:35.646 --> 48:36.647
* I'm waiting for a man

48:36.747 --> 48:40.051
* From Afghanistan to come

48:40.151 --> 48:42.487
* He got a kilo in the
bottom of a suitcase

48:42.587 --> 48:45.690
* In a cabin son

48:45.790 --> 48:48.493
* If the captain comes
you don't give him no lip

48:48.593 --> 48:51.997
* But you pick it up later
and you know the trip *

48:52.097 --> 48:53.664
- When we came back,

48:53.764 --> 48:56.367
we shipped the surfboards
as unaccompanied baggage.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.269
We got home and
everything was cool.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.238
United Airlines had
had some kind of strike

49:00.338 --> 49:01.906
in their cargo thing,

49:02.007 --> 49:05.576
and the two surfboards sat
out in the yard in the sun.

49:05.676 --> 49:07.245
And they were in canvas bags,

49:07.345 --> 49:09.747
that were made out
of denim, blue denim.

49:09.847 --> 49:12.417
And the hash started goin' off,

49:12.517 --> 49:15.086
started decaying in
there and swelled up.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.354
So, when the strike was over

49:16.454 --> 49:17.688
they went to ship
the boards to LA,

49:17.788 --> 49:18.789
someone picked 'em up

49:18.889 --> 49:20.225
and stuff was rattling
around in there.

49:20.325 --> 49:22.727
They cut 'em open,
they found the hash.

49:22.827 --> 49:25.263
They shipped it on over,
had me come pick it up.

49:25.363 --> 49:26.731
Customs agents even
helped me load it

49:26.831 --> 49:27.865
and tie it on the car,

49:27.965 --> 49:30.635
rather than bust me
right on the spot,

49:30.735 --> 49:34.439
and then they followed me.

49:34.539 --> 49:38.143
- The rule at the ranch was,
not to endanger the ranch.

49:38.243 --> 49:41.146
You know, don't
bring the load there.

49:41.246 --> 49:44.649
Travis, God bless his soul,

49:44.749 --> 49:47.552
has brought more
heat down people

49:47.652 --> 49:51.289
than anyone I've ever known.

49:51.389 --> 49:54.425
The feds followed
them all the way,

49:54.525 --> 49:56.627
all the way to
the fucking ranch,

49:56.727 --> 49:59.630
and it was a disaster.

49:59.730 --> 50:02.167
- They had a plane spotting me.

50:02.267 --> 50:03.901
And when I went through
the locked gate,

50:04.001 --> 50:05.670
and got part way up the road,

50:05.770 --> 50:06.837
I remember turning back

50:06.937 --> 50:07.938
and looking back
down in the valley,

50:08.039 --> 50:09.940
and seeing this train of cars,

50:10.041 --> 50:13.611
just coming up the dirt
road, just hauling ass.

50:13.711 --> 50:14.779
And they swooped on us,

50:14.879 --> 50:16.147
guns drawn and
everything and got us.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.815
And then they wanted to
see what was up this road,

50:17.915 --> 50:20.385
where I was going.

50:20.485 --> 50:22.787
- The next thing I
know, Travis pulls up,

50:22.887 --> 50:25.156
and down comes the helicopter

50:25.256 --> 50:28.093
that had followed
him all the way in.

50:28.193 --> 50:31.596
We looked out the windows
and went, "Holy God!"

50:31.696 --> 50:36.334
You know, they are so here.

50:36.434 --> 50:38.436
- The cops pull right up in
the front of the ranch there.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.438
There's all these
hippies everywhere.

50:40.538 --> 50:41.872
You know, they don't
even know what to think.

50:41.972 --> 50:44.709
What the heck's this?

50:44.809 --> 50:46.577
And then they took me away.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.119
- Everything was blown.

50:54.219 --> 50:55.686
Now passports were checked.

50:55.786 --> 50:57.021
What was shipped back?

50:57.122 --> 50:58.823
Those surfboards,
what was in 'em?

50:58.923 --> 51:02.627
I mean everything,
now they know.

51:02.727 --> 51:05.663
Now, legal things are
starting to happen.

51:05.763 --> 51:09.734
A lot of money that was
earned went into legal defense

51:09.834 --> 51:12.337
for whoever it was
that was in trouble.

51:12.437 --> 51:13.838
We were a family, you know.

51:13.938 --> 51:15.973
Nobody, nobody suffered.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.514
- [Michael R.] Timothy Leary
and a small contingency

51:23.614 --> 51:24.849
of people from Millbrook

51:24.949 --> 51:27.818
came to live at the ranch.

51:27.918 --> 51:30.688
- Timothy's
philosophy is Taoism.

51:30.788 --> 51:33.558
Taoism wants you to stay down.

51:33.658 --> 51:36.261
Stay in the background,
behind the scenes.

51:36.361 --> 51:38.329
And when Timothy decided
to run for governor,

51:38.429 --> 51:41.332
it was almost against everything
he'd been teaching us.

51:41.432 --> 51:43.334
- I'm going to run
for the governorship

51:43.434 --> 51:45.002
of the state of California.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.772
I think that we
need a new party,

51:47.872 --> 51:50.241
and by party I mean party.

51:50.341 --> 51:52.710
- We were like, what?

51:52.810 --> 51:55.513
This guy's sitting in the
teepee, next to the pear tree,

51:55.613 --> 51:57.282
in the meadow at our ranch,

51:57.382 --> 51:59.250
should not be
running for governor.

51:59.350 --> 52:01.686
* When you make love

52:01.786 --> 52:04.222
* Play it to me

52:04.322 --> 52:06.191
- [Carol] Johnny and I, when
we got back to the teepee,

52:06.291 --> 52:07.858
we both cried,

52:07.958 --> 52:10.728
because it was
something had changed.

52:10.828 --> 52:14.365
It wasn't going in the
direction that we wanted.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.967
- We had this engagement
in the real world out here,

52:17.067 --> 52:18.569
because we were
trying to change it,

52:18.669 --> 52:21.138
but we didn't want to
be governor, you know.

52:21.239 --> 52:22.773
I might have to put suits on

52:22.873 --> 52:24.575
and dress up like I'm straight,

52:24.675 --> 52:28.613
but that don't mean I
have to be straight.

52:28.713 --> 52:30.248
- [Travis] John Lennon
wrote Come Together

52:30.348 --> 52:34.285
as Timothy Leary's
campaign song.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.120
People hear that on the
radio all the time now.

52:36.221 --> 52:37.922
That song plays well,
every theme song

52:38.022 --> 52:40.891
for Timothy Leary's
governor race.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.093
He was gonna run against
Ronald Reagan as governor.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.829
- Let the kids get high.

52:44.929 --> 52:46.664
As a matter of fact,
President Nixon,

52:46.764 --> 52:50.000
why don't we all
turn on together.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.168
- [Michael K.] At the time,

52:51.269 --> 52:53.938
the government probably
feared Tim Leary

52:54.038 --> 52:56.106
more than they feared anybody.

52:56.207 --> 52:57.808
Nixon thought that dope dealers

52:57.908 --> 53:00.311
were among the worst
criminals on Earth.

53:00.411 --> 53:02.747
- We must wage what I
would call total war

53:02.847 --> 53:05.015
against public enemy number one

53:05.115 --> 53:06.451
in the United States,

53:06.551 --> 53:09.454
the problem of dangerous drugs.

53:09.554 --> 53:10.955
- [Travis] That was the
beginning of the end.

53:11.055 --> 53:13.991
That was when they
decided to target Tim.

53:14.091 --> 53:16.927
They're gonna get him
one way or the other.

53:26.971 --> 53:28.105
- This one night,

53:28.205 --> 53:31.276
and it was December 26th of '68,

53:31.376 --> 53:33.778
at about 11:00 P.M.,

53:33.878 --> 53:38.849
I by myself, black and white
police unit, full uniform,

53:38.949 --> 53:41.652
and here's this car stopped

53:41.752 --> 53:45.356
facing me in the
middle of the road.

53:45.456 --> 53:48.359
So, I walk over and
I tap on the window,

53:48.459 --> 53:50.295
and all of a sudden
the window comes down.

53:50.395 --> 53:53.030
And this grey-haired guy says,

53:53.130 --> 53:56.200
"What's the problem
officer?", real nice.

53:56.301 --> 53:58.135
And I looked at him

53:58.235 --> 54:01.706
and I'm thinkin', "Holy moly,

54:01.806 --> 54:04.875
"this looks like Leary."

54:04.975 --> 54:07.812
I said, "May I see
your driver's license?"

54:07.912 --> 54:09.246
"Oh sure", real nice.

54:09.347 --> 54:12.249
Come, take out, and
all of a sudden, bingo.

54:12.350 --> 54:15.753
Timothy Leary,
1230 Queens Street,

54:15.853 --> 54:17.888
Berkeley, California.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.924
I said, "Well, Mr. Leary,

54:20.024 --> 54:24.395
"I smell the odor of burned
marijuana", which I did.

54:24.495 --> 54:27.031
I tell Leary, "Step
out of the car.

54:27.131 --> 54:28.766
"This is a narcotic
investigation."

54:28.866 --> 54:31.201
He is just coming unglued.

54:31.302 --> 54:33.203
You don't have probable cause.

54:33.304 --> 54:35.039
This is an illegal stop.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.874
This is an illegal
this and that.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.509
I go in his car,

54:38.609 --> 54:40.545
obvious place to look
first, the ashtray.

54:40.645 --> 54:43.781
There's two little
roaches there.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.951
Pull 'em out, and I said,

54:47.051 --> 54:49.920
"You're under
arrest, Mr. Leary."

54:50.020 --> 54:52.189
- [Voiceover] Dr. Leary's
political ambitions

54:52.289 --> 54:53.524
were cut short,

54:53.624 --> 54:55.526
when Governor Reagan
had Leary arrested,

54:55.626 --> 54:57.595
and sentenced to
30 years in jail,

54:57.695 --> 55:01.298
for possession of $10
worth of marijuana.

55:08.673 --> 55:13.043
- Tim was in prison and
we were taking his appeal.

55:13.143 --> 55:16.781
He had been arrested in
Texas, bullshit charges.

55:16.881 --> 55:19.717
He was arrested in
California twice,

55:19.817 --> 55:21.552
again no real charges,

55:21.652 --> 55:25.623
but he was a political
person who they feared.

55:25.723 --> 55:28.393
And they would do anything
to get him off the street,

55:28.493 --> 55:29.994
get him into prison,

55:30.094 --> 55:32.129
and try and shut him down.

55:32.229 --> 55:34.932
- Timothy was a
spiritual leader,

55:35.032 --> 55:39.437
and to keep the path
going of Orange Sunshine,

55:39.537 --> 55:41.906
we did the outrageous
other option

55:42.006 --> 55:43.674
that no one thinks of:

55:43.774 --> 55:46.844
prison break.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.813
The first thing that we did is

55:48.913 --> 55:50.981
looked at the prison
that Timothy was in

55:51.081 --> 55:54.652
and started working with
this guy on the inside,

55:54.752 --> 55:57.822
"What is the best way
to get out of here?"

55:57.922 --> 55:58.956
That was over the fence,

55:59.056 --> 56:01.692
just a straight
up over the fence.

56:01.792 --> 56:04.328
There was a place that
was perfect to go over,

56:04.429 --> 56:06.130
the way the trees were situated,

56:06.230 --> 56:09.033
the road was virtually
right fucking there.

56:09.133 --> 56:11.969
And Timothy needed to start
doing pullups and things

56:12.069 --> 56:13.838
so he had better
upper body strength,

56:13.938 --> 56:17.475
and could get his
ass over that fence.

56:17.575 --> 56:19.544
- [Carol] I remember talks

56:19.644 --> 56:21.779
around the table
of the main house.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.048
"Who was gonna fly him
from here to there?"

56:24.148 --> 56:28.085
- This went on for six months,
nine months or something.

56:34.124 --> 56:37.127
(eery music)

57:05.990 --> 57:09.760
You know, when you
take LSD with people,

57:09.860 --> 57:15.466
you feel every thought,
every emotion all together.

57:15.566 --> 57:21.238
And so, when you take LSD with a

57:21.338 --> 57:24.108
advanced spiritual being,

57:24.208 --> 57:26.176
you're gonna know
about it right away.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.679
You will have a
different kind of trip.

57:28.779 --> 57:32.750
And that's what Johnny was.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.251
- See, the higher
doses you take,

57:34.351 --> 57:36.086
the more far out it gets.

57:36.186 --> 57:38.188
And it can get pretty scary too.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.558
John was always there for
when it got really heavy.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.360
John would be the guy
that could reassure you,

57:43.460 --> 57:45.930
grab your hand and just
touch you to make it feel,

57:46.030 --> 57:48.432
make you go ma, the
bad stuff go away,

57:48.533 --> 57:53.771
just with his presence.

57:53.871 --> 57:57.241
- God always chooses
unlikely things, you know.

57:57.341 --> 57:58.743
Holy men are not

57:58.843 --> 58:01.411
always what you
really might think of.

58:01.512 --> 58:03.213
They're ...

58:03.313 --> 58:05.149
A good holy man
has got some flaws,

58:05.249 --> 58:06.751
and something wrong,

58:06.851 --> 58:10.054
or maybe they're not a
perfect person now to T,

58:10.154 --> 58:14.191
but they have a gift that is

58:14.291 --> 58:17.227
something you can't explain.

58:17.327 --> 58:20.130
Johnny Griggs was that way.

58:20.230 --> 58:23.500
He was the most powerful man.

58:23.601 --> 58:24.935
- You know, I could
never take LSD

58:25.035 --> 58:27.337
with anyone that
was higher than him.

58:27.437 --> 58:28.906
It was unbelievable.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.108
He really was something.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.144
(eery music)

58:38.215 --> 58:39.750
- We were in our teepee,

58:39.850 --> 58:42.086
up in Idyllwild at the ranch,

58:42.186 --> 58:44.855
and Johnny wanted to give thanks

58:44.955 --> 58:46.957
to the universe.

58:47.057 --> 58:49.126
And we got things
ready in the teepee,

58:49.226 --> 58:50.795
and food prepared,

58:50.895 --> 58:52.930
and our firewood
stacked and stuff,

58:53.030 --> 58:57.067
and we were gonna
have a session.

58:57.167 --> 59:00.470
My mother, and father, and
grandmother had all come up,

59:00.571 --> 59:03.874
and they took the
children with them,

59:03.974 --> 59:07.044
so it was just Johnny and I.

59:07.144 --> 59:12.216
I took the mescaline,
and I thought Johnny did.

59:12.316 --> 59:15.853
I had no idea.

59:15.953 --> 59:18.322
It hadn't been very long,

59:18.422 --> 59:20.190
maybe an hour.

59:20.290 --> 59:25.229
Johnny says, "Something
feels not right to me."

59:25.329 --> 59:26.831
And I said, "What do
you mean, not right?"

59:26.931 --> 59:28.498
And I said, "I feel just fine."

59:28.599 --> 59:31.168
He said, "Well, I didn't
take what you took."

59:31.268 --> 59:34.304
He says, "I was testing
this new stuff",

59:34.404 --> 59:37.241
that had just been given to him.

59:37.341 --> 59:40.177
Johnny decided that
whatever was happening

59:40.277 --> 59:42.212
to his body wasn't right.

59:42.312 --> 59:46.150
He said, "Call out", because
other people in their teepees

59:46.250 --> 59:48.185
were going to trip
that night also.

59:48.285 --> 59:49.586
It was gonna be a group thing,

59:49.687 --> 59:51.889
but we had started early.

59:51.989 --> 59:55.025
So, we stayed together
most of the night,

59:55.125 --> 59:58.195
but he was physically
struggling,

59:58.295 --> 01:00:03.067
which I had never
ever seen before.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:06.236
At one point, I was walking
out the teepee door,

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.572
and he said, "Stand
there for a minute."

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.608
And I stood there, and he said,

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.511
"I do believe you are
the most beautiful thing

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.114
"I have ever seen in my life."

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.049
And just then,
like, I don't know,

01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:23.220
it was like electricity
went through me.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.455
You know, it was ...

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:28.793
I felt like he was
saying goodbye,

01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:30.360
and I just panicked.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.797
I said, "Johnny please,
please don't leave me.

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:35.299
"I mean if that's what's
going on, I can't.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.401
"I don't wanna be
here without you."

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:39.904
You know, he was my teacher,

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:43.273
my lover, my best friend.

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:46.576
You know, he was my
boyfriend, you know.

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:49.313
And, he said, "Mama",

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:52.216
he said, "we got it made."

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:56.153
The sun just came up
and he fell forward.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:59.189
(dramatic music)

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:09.800
I ran out of the teepee and
there were some other people.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.669
Mark got his dad to
pull up the pickup.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.710
We went down to
the Hemet hospital.

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:35.926
Mark and I, we got
ahold of Michael.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:39.930
- I was talking to
Carol on the phone.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.267
And the doctor came to her.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:47.204
I could hear him,
said, "He's gone."

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.040
When they told her that Johnny

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.610
had died, she started
crying and screaming.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.286
- And I handed
the phone to Mark,

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.289
and Mark said, "You
know, it's true."

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.192
Michael couldn't even accept it.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.393
None of us could.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.862
It just, we were not prepared.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.363
Boom,

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:17.802
the teacher was gone.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.504
- He took the psilocybin,

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.873
and we don't know what happened.

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:24.508
I had taken it many times.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:29.213
We had all taken it before.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:32.249
So, I took some,

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.418
'cause I figured fuck
it, I'll go with him.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:37.855
I don't know, I wasn't
sure what to do.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.890
It didn't kill me.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.994
It didn't kill me.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.462
He was only 26.

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:02.779
(somber music)

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.415
- [Carol] After Johnny
died, I think that's what

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:09.553
shattered a lot of the
southern California movement.

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:12.289
I think it shook a
lot of people's faith.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:13.958
- It left some people adrift.

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:16.560
Some people didn't have
enough of their own,

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.528
their own, know who
they were themselves,

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.430
so many people relied
so much on John

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.700
that it left them adrift.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.269
A lot of people
split at that point,

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:28.438
after John died,
everybody just scattered.

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.274
- The Brothers sent
me over to Hawaii.

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:33.643
They've got a big house there.

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:36.080
I just remember in my mind,

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.449
it was hell being in paradise.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:42.052
To feel so broken,

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:46.523
and then to be in such
a beautiful place,

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:49.626
But I, you know, held up.

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:52.129
You know, because
I had children.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.563
I just knew I had to be strong.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.399
No matter what, I had children,

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.568
and I had to be strong, I
had a baby at my breast.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.671
Yeah.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:06.043
That's a hard thing to do.

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:08.445
- Travis and other
people went to Hawaii,

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:12.950
leaving more of a skeleton
crew at the ranch.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.519
I made sure there was
money for things to work.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:18.755
I took care of
Carol and the kids.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.458
I had to keep in motion.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.493
Big things were going on.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.029
Big, big things were going on.

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:27.531
I cannot let go of
this, I have to.

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:29.466
The only way to accomplish
what was started

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:31.801
is to continue to
follow the path,

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.603
kind of like that
little trail of crumbs

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:39.509
wherever God is taking me.

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:43.513
I got very high at the
ranch once, by myself.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.516
I think I took five doses
of Sunshine or something,

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.718
you know, maybe 10,

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:51.755
and John came to me.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:55.559
And we didn't talk, but
there was energy exchanged,

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.894
and information and things.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:02.766
And it was positively
him, positively him.

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:07.671
We spent the day together,
and we made a few plans.

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:12.242
We focused things, or
we clarified things,

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:14.678
and I knew, I knew that
we were gonna go forward

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:17.214
and really kick some ass now.

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:19.883
We were gonna do it and we did.

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:23.587
We made 10 kilos
of LSD after that,

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:30.127
10 kilos of pure white LSD.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:33.563
No one's ever done that before,

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.432
or since.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.768
It's a lot lot.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.171
- 100 million doses.

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:52.082
- [Carol] Most of
the meetings about

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:53.883
planning Timothy's escape

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:59.756
were all done at the ranch.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:01.591
Michael finally came up.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.593
He had a date and times,

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.562
and they're, everybody's
gonna be waiting,

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.764
and it's gonna happen.

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:10.767
- There were people from
New York at the ranch,

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.269
and other people,

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.871
and they gathered everyone
together and said,

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.641
"Everybody, except the
people live at the ranch

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.876
"need to leave now.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.845
"Go now.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.480
"Don't be here."

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.415
And a couple of people had
been growing some pot plants.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:26.883
I said, "You know what?

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.453
"Pull those fucking pot
plants up and get everything.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.654
"We gotta get ready.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:34.424
"The onslaught, they're
gonna come here."

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:36.260
Timothy needed to use a blanket

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.164
to keep the barbed wire
and razor wire away,

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:43.767
and then drop down and
wait at a certain place.

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:47.304
And this all had to be timed.

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:49.839
It all turns out
that it was perfect.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:53.477
- $17,000, that what
we gave the weathermen,

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:57.514
what they charged for picking
him up outside the prison.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.183
- They drove off a little ways.

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:00.917
He changed clothes immediately.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.619
Then they met another car,

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:03.687
and they gave the clothes,

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.622
his prison clothes
to the other car,

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:07.757
who turned around
and went south.

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.627
They north with Timothy
where there was a motorhome

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:14.964
that took him to Canada
and they split from there.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:17.134
- Dr. Timothy Leary,
formerly of Harvard,

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:19.603
now known as the high
priest of the drug cult

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.004
escaped during the night

01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:23.807
from the California Men's
Colony of San Luis Obispo.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.375
Apparently he simply walked out

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:29.913
of the minimum security prison.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:32.282
- [Voiceover]
September 15th, 1970.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.118
This is the fourth communication

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.220
from the Weathermen Underground.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.654
The Weathermen
Underground has had

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:39.823
the honor and pleasure of
helping Dr. Timothy Leary

01:07:39.923 --> 01:07:41.191
escaped from the POW camp

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.128
of San Luis Obispo, California.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.730
Dr. Leary was being
held against his will,

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:50.467
and against the will of millions
of kids in this country.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.001
He was a political prisoner,

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.171
captured for the work he
did in helping all of us

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.039
begin the task of
creating a new culture

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.874
on the barren wasteland
that has been imposed

01:07:57.974 --> 01:08:00.577
on this country by
Democrats, Republicans,

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.213
Capitalists, and creeps.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.582
LSD and grass, like
the herbs, and cactus,

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.717
and mushrooms, of
the American Indians,

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.085
and countless civilizations

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:10.687
that have existed on this planet

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.422
will help us make a future world

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.824
where it will be possible
to live in peace.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.560
Now, we are at war.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.675
- I had this little short

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.844
fling thing in life.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.113
This man from New York,

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:39.749
he wanted to wine and dine me,

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.085
take me

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:45.189
to Jamaica, me and the kids.

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:47.756
And I considered
taking off and just

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:53.830
go to some foreign country and
drop out for a little while.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.866
And Michael'd come up with some

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.102
really beautiful,
gorgeous woman.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:00.737
She was French or Moroccan.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.772
She had the accent, the looks.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.908
She was just so
fabulous, you know?

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.577
I felt jealous.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.046
I'd never ever, I didn't
know what the feeling was,

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.481
'cause I'd never
felt that before.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.716
I never had to, not like that.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:17.720
And, they went off, went
under the waterfall tripping,

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.622
and I tell my girlfriends,

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:22.426
"God, what is, why
do I feel this way?

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:24.794
"Why do I feel so
anxious and torn

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:28.665
"that he's all gone off
with this woman, you know."

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.434
I says, "I don't know."

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.303
I says, "I think
I love Michael."

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:35.404
- I was with someone on

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.506
the top of the mountain,

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.843
that was my lover for a while.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.444
And I loved this woman.

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:42.845
I loved her a lot,

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:45.349
but I realized, just like

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:47.517
a bell went off,

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:50.254
that I loved Carol,

01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:53.590
and that she was the
only woman I wanted.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.192
I just wanted Carol.

01:09:56.293 --> 01:09:58.528
I mean, I just knew it.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:09:59.929
Boom!

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.931
I said, "I'm gonna
do everything I can,

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.033
"and come, and come back here,

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:08.305
"and I'm gonna try and
get her to marry me."

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.873
- [Carol] When he
showed up at the ranch,

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.008
with his little
suitcase, you know,

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:13.142
I was in the kitchen,

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:14.378
and I was hand-squeezing
orange juice,

01:10:14.478 --> 01:10:16.880
and making oatmeal for the kids,

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.283
and all of a sudden he appeared.

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:23.620
Said, "I just came up to
tell you that I loved you."

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.155
- I told Carol, "I
gotta have you, baby."

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:27.691
- And I said, "My God!"

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:28.692
You know?

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:30.193
I mean, I had no idea he had

01:10:30.294 --> 01:10:32.996
those kind of feelings
for me, you know.

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:36.900
I said, "Well, I was thinking
about running off to Jamaica"

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.235
And he said, "My
God, what about me?"

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:41.037
And I just looked
at him and said,

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:42.706
"Yeah, what about you?

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.841
"You know, I'm totally
in love with you.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:48.177
"I was just trying to
escape somewhere, you know?"

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:53.950
He threw a kiss on me and
we've never been apart.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.986
- Shortly after
that, we got married.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:00.023
(mellow music)

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:16.740
In the early 70s, we had become

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.444
an international

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.079
situation.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:27.283
We made a really huge
amount of acid in Europe.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:30.954
And we set up hash oil
factories in Lebanon.

01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:32.956
- At that particular point,

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:35.525
The Brotherhood was the largest

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.529
supplier of psychedelics,

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.866
in the world.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:46.269
- We tried to get
the feds involved.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.938
We tried FBI.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:51.541
Not anything doin'.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.043
We tried the B and DD.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.080
They said, "Oh, we've
heard about this group.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.615
"It's nothing."

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:01.985
And we said, "Look,
this is what we have."

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:05.589
We brought in a couple
boxes of records,

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:08.257
showing this whole tie-in.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:11.060
There is an organization called

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.296
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:17.767
Yes, it's incorporated as
a religious organization,

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:21.137
but within that organization
is this core group

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:26.175
of big time buyers
and distributors,

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:29.145
and it's just not Laguna Beach.

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:31.247
It is nationwide,

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.318
and now we're finding
out it's international.

01:12:35.419 --> 01:12:40.724
And the feds were
just spellbound.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:43.259
- We really became a target.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.961
The crosshairs were on us,

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.164
and on me a lot.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:49.833
We knew our phone was tapped,

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.502
we knew that we were under
surveillance a lot of time.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.638
- It took 'em another year

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:57.173
of watching and
tapping and foll--

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:59.008
they followed me
to Saint Martin,

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.044
followed me ski trips,

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.980
followed me to Europe,
followed me everywhere.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.381
They didn't catch me.

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:06.950
They didn't catch me smuggling.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.351
They caught me with
a whole lot of money,

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:10.019
but they didn't catch
me with any dope.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:13.457
- They never got any hash.

01:13:13.557 --> 01:13:16.159
So, how can you be
convicted of smuggling

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:17.994
3000 pounds of hash,

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.830
when they don't
even have one pound?

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.165
They don't have an ounce.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:23.567
They don't have anything.

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:25.969
- There was never a case
that the government had made

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:30.474
that really had any substantial
criminality underlying it.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.308
They just didn't have it.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.243
So, what the
government had to do

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.646
was bring the Hell's
Angels into the case,

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.981
and say to the world,

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.583
"These guys are working
with the Hell's Angels.

01:13:39.683 --> 01:13:40.850
"They're making acid.

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.151
"Hell's Angels are
distributing the acid.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.386
"Killing everybody.

01:13:43.487 --> 01:13:45.154
"They're the nastiest
people on Earth,

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.724
"so these guys can't be
any god damn good either."

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:50.159
That was their whole
theory of the conspiracy.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.427
Put the bad together
with the good

01:13:51.528 --> 01:13:57.801
and bring the good down.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:14:00.604
- The Brotherhood indictment
was a conspiracy charge

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:02.405
for everything, you name it.

01:14:02.506 --> 01:14:06.275
It was conspiracy engulfed
it all, from hash smuggling,

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.877
weed smuggling,

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.680
manufacturing of LSD.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:16.853
They were charged with it all.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:20.056
Michael and Eleanora,
our lawyers called me,

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.092
and said, "I do believe

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:26.996
"it's time to leave."

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:28.097
- [Voiceover] Over the weekend,

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.933
in a concerted multi-state raid,

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.367
federal authorities
captured members

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.369
of the international
drug-smuggling ring

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.438
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:37.206
- When the indictment came out,

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.942
it was like (mimics explosion).

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:41.244
They hit everywhere, they
got everybody at once.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:42.378
It was like, bam!

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:43.813
You know, everybody was busted.

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:45.782
- [Travis] They were
busting my ranch.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.884
They were busting
Chuck Scott's house.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.786
They were busting Jack
Harrington's house,

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:51.087
looking for Gordon.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:53.623
They were going
after everybody, man.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:56.125
- [Voiceover] Federal, state,
and local narcotics officers

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.461
arrested 15 of 29
persons indicted

01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:00.263
by the Orange County grand jury.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:01.164
- [Voiceover] Authorities seized

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.099
7.9 million dollars in drugs,

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.134
and two LSD laboratories.

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.804
- At the time, it
was a unprecedented

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.907
coordinated effort
among the feds,

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.776
and all the local people;

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:15.344
California, Oregon, Hawaii.

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:18.414
The news people
were all over it.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:23.252
They were gonna put us
down once and for all.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.255
Mark Stanton, and Russell
and his wife and kids,

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.523
everybody had kids,

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.593
me and Carol and all,
didn't know what to do,

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:34.197
so we went to the Barnum
and Bailey Circus.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:38.101
And we just sort of
stayed there all day.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:42.171
We could be anonymous in it.

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.873
And we saw the first show,

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.208
and then it got finished.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:47.110
Saw the next show,

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.213
and we would sometimes
go out to the car

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:51.881
and listen to the
radio a little bit,

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:53.717
and see if we could
hear anything else.

01:15:53.817 --> 01:15:55.151
- [Voiceover] Three more member

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:56.285
of the Brotherhood
of Eternal Love

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.621
have been caught in
an overnight raid

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:59.789
by authorities in Orange
County, California.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.157
- [Voiceover] 14 members
of The Brotherhood,

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.160
including Dr. Timothy
Leary, remain fugitives.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:04.961
Authorities now--

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:05.862
- That was it.

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:08.231
That was the day that was over.

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:10.900
You know, everything that
we had known before that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.401
was pretty much finished.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.638
- We just ran.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.840
We all just ran,

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:23.613
and hid, with our kids.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.081
- [Carol] We were all separating

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:27.817
and going different
places to hide out.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.052
- [Voiceover] The pre-dawn sweep

01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:30.253
of southern and
northern California,

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.387
Hawaii, and Oregon,

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:33.589
netted 1.5 million LSD tablets,

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:35.391
30 gallons of hashish oil.

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:37.694
- Somebody warned me that
they knew where I was

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.228
and they were coming to get me.

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.897
- So, Travis and I left.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:42.598
We left that afternoon.

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:45.201
And we flew from
there to Belize,

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:47.771
and then from Belize
we took a bus,

01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:50.439
and then we switched our IDs
as we crossed the border.

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:55.244
We went into
Yucatan with new ID.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.747
- Michael and I went
to the Caribbean.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.216
We just bought
tickets, paid cash.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:03.286
Gone, no record, nobody.

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.855
We went to the Bahamas
and Cayman Islands,

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.257
and we ended up in Jamaica.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.961
We were underground for sure.

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:13.629
We had to change our identity,

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.964
but we were good at that.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.232
We were like chameleons,

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:19.635
whatever the situation
called for, you know.

01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:21.404
Be straight, be not straight.

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:22.972
You know, be groovy,

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.941
whatever we needed to be.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:27.376
Our children, you know, they
all kept their first names.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.246
You know, they knew if
somebody asked them questions,

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:32.248
they just don't answer
certain questions.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:36.152
They don't know,
they're just kids.

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:39.388
I had to change their
original transcripts

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:42.358
into a different name,

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:47.630
so we had records to
get 'em into school.

01:17:47.731 --> 01:17:49.398
The future was uncertain.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.736
- [Michael R.] I did not know
when we went to New Mexico

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:55.238
what was gonna happen.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:58.574
I bought some jewelry equipment
and stone cutting equipment,

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.345
and I started making
a living with that.

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:05.581
- We were just at the crest
of the wave of the big boom

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.616
of Indian turquoise jewelry,

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:11.420
when it went off in the 70s.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.622
- Well, I spent 11
years as a fugitive.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:15.424
Raised my family as a fugitive,

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.193
living all over world.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:20.263
And I actually hooked
up with Michael Randall,

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.867
and Chuck Scott who I
hadn't seen in years.

01:18:23.967 --> 01:18:25.534
Kind of rejoined the crew.

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:27.370
I bought a ton of hash,

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.439
so I gave them the whole
Moroccan load to sell.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:35.178
I just let them do it,
and they moved it all.

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:37.180
- We were in the studio one day,

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.648
and the phone rang and
it was from Travis,

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:41.617
and I could hear
the conversation,

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.219
Michael talking to 'em,

01:18:43.319 --> 01:18:49.358
Something inside me just
knew something was wrong.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:54.563
- They tapped every phone
in the town of Long Pine.

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.232
Me and a guy named Bill

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:58.968
were taking a Cayman Airways
flight over the Grand Canyon.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:02.505
We got on the plane,
and the door closes.

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:04.140
The plane pulls
away from the gate.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.374
It was about three feet.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.343
It pulls back up.

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:09.678
The door opens, these
guys come on board,

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.347
two or three of 'em, memory ...

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.482
They come up, stop
right at my row,

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.651
look at me and go,
"Mr. Ashbrook?"

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:18.154
I hadn't used the name in years,

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.522
years, and years.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:20.890
I just didn't even look up.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:23.426
"Mr. Ashbrook?

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:24.994
"Come with us, please."

01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:33.436
- [Voiceover] I had met this
guy through Chuck Scott,

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.038
from the east coast

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:38.541
who had been bringing in
Pakistani hash on airplanes.

01:19:38.641 --> 01:19:41.444
And he had somebody at
the airport in New York

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.346
that would clear it.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.580
I met Kitting,

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.249
he seemed like a straight
shooter, good guy.

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.085
So I fly to Afghanistan,
and I land I Kabul.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:51.554
And when I'm walking
up to immigration,

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.289
they see my name on my passport,

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:54.891
and I'm red-listed.

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:57.093
So, all of a sudden,
everything's different

01:19:57.193 --> 01:20:00.063
than anything I'd experienced
flying in there before.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:06.335
A guy says, "I need
you to come with me."

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:09.973
- I was on the run
for about 10 years.

01:20:10.073 --> 01:20:11.574
After I got back to America,

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:13.709
when I was back in
California permanently,

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:17.446
I didn't have any ID
for about eight years.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.782
One day I'm moving Wendy
up to northern California,

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:21.617
and I've got big pickup truck,

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:23.419
and it's filled with her stuff,

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.889
where I can't see behind me.

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:28.157
And I pull into
this liquor store,

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:29.993
but I kinda miss
the entrance to it,

01:20:30.093 --> 01:20:31.260
and I had to back up,

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.495
but I couldn't tell if
anyone was behind me,

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.429
and I couldn't see him.

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.497
So, I backed the truck up,

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:35.764
and I pulled around,

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:37.833
pulled into the little
convenience store,

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.435
whatever market was there,

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.737
and I jumped out of my
truck and I looked back,

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.139
and my car's like this,

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:45.641
and a cop car's
parked right there,

01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:46.943
and he's got his window down,

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.677
and he's goin' like this.

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:51.280
And he tells me, "Well, you
almost hit me back there.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.348
"You know that?"

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:53.516
I said, "I know,
I couldn't see,

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:54.918
"but I didn't hit you, right?"

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:58.087
He said, "No, but you
really came close though.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:01.590
He says, "Well, let
me see your license."

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.791
And I told him ...

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.360
I kind of hemmed and hawed,

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.462
and he said, "You don't
have a license, do you?"

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:10.866
I told him, "No."

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:12.135
- [Michael R.] Chuck
Scott was killed

01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:16.405
by US Marshals in Mill Valley.

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:19.475
- Shot him in the head
as he was running,

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:22.946
in front of his
wife and his baby,

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:25.949
and she was pregnant.

01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:27.984
Police were going to
my parents' house,

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:32.888
telling 'em, "You know, we
just shot Chuck in the back.

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:35.124
"You better tell us where
your son and daughter are.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.859
"You know, because
when we find 'em,

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.627
"we're not going
to ask questions.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:43.232
"We're going to be shooting."

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:46.135
- We were living
outside of Boulder.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.404
It was a little
town called Lions,

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:52.308
out where it's really
in the country.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.742
It was a hot summer day,

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.512
and I had, I was studying for my

01:21:56.612 --> 01:22:00.383
GIA Diamond Certificate class.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:01.717
I'm studying for it,

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:04.020
and my son, Daniel,
is takin' a nap.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.989
He's sleepin' in my lap,

01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:08.257
and the front door was open.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:10.559
I didn't even hear
their cars come.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:16.932
(ominous music)

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:19.668
- We were down in the
lower part of our house.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.171
It was like a sunken room.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:26.442
I stood up, and I looked out,

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:29.945
and I could see all these men

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:35.151
surrounding our
house with rifles.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:36.919
And I went over, and I said,

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.222
"Honey, they're here."

01:22:39.322 --> 01:22:40.723
And he said, "Who?

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:43.092
"The kids are back from
the beach already?"

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:47.430
I said, "No, they're here."

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:49.532
I made Michael promise me

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:52.768
that he would not panic and run.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:00.043
- [Michael R.] They came
charging in pointing 45s at me,

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:00.976
and I'm trying to tell them,

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:03.712
"I have a child in my lap."

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:10.019
You know, be careful.

01:23:10.119 --> 01:23:13.256
- They allowed us
to hug and kiss.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.658
They handcuffed him,

01:23:15.758 --> 01:23:17.326
and that's when they drove away.

01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:31.374
(somber music)

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:54.597
The 60s had its casualties.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:57.466
It wasn't just a clean
ride for everybody.

01:23:57.566 --> 01:24:01.604
And I know that
more than anybody.

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:05.941
But, through all trials,
tribulation, and suffering,

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.811
we never ever lost faith.

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:11.614
There was so much at stake.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:13.149
We were a unit,

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.783
and whatever we went through,

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.652
we went through together,

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:18.154
as a group,

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:20.623
as a couple,

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.425
as a family.

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.139
- Well, I made it.

01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:37.406
- [Carol] You must
have been overhead.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:38.674
- Good, good, good
to see you again.

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:39.875
You good?

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:41.043
If you go like that, you
got one missing lens.

01:24:41.144 --> 01:24:43.379
We were very idealistic.

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:45.848
We were young kids and

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:48.484
it seemed like a
beautiful utopia dream.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.052
We were trying to make it real.

01:24:50.153 --> 01:24:52.255
- [Voiceover] One, two three.

01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:53.856
And again.

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:55.224
- The Brotherhood
will never end.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:57.160
It's in the people that
had that experience,

01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.728
that were there, that
experienced that special time.

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.597
It'll be with 'em forever.

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:03.632
They'll carry it
past their graves.

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:10.773
- [Wendy] No, your favorite.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:11.707
- Oh, okay.

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:13.842
We don't have Social Security.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.578
We have nothing.

01:25:15.678 --> 01:25:19.215
If I don't pay my rent next
month, we're on the street.

01:25:19.315 --> 01:25:20.549
There probably isn't one of us

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:21.950
that couldn't say that
the other guy owes 'em

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.118
a half a million,

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:24.587
but I imagine if he
paid a half million,

01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:25.754
he'd pay the half
million, that all,

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:28.391
that there would
be even in the end,

01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:29.725
'cause everybody's got a story,

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:31.394
but we don't care.

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:33.296
It isn't like somebody else
burned us, or took anything.

01:25:33.396 --> 01:25:34.730
Loaded balls, we don't care.

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.432
It all's a wash.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:38.267
We're here, we love each other.

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:39.602
Awesome, dude.

01:25:39.702 --> 01:25:41.136
I'm happy to spend
the day with you.

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:43.739
Those things don't change,
those things don't change.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.442
Once you really are
the same, and one,

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:48.811
and brothers, and real
friends, it doesn't matter.

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.613
Time can't space friends.

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:52.147
You just are.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.895
- [Voiceover] I often thought

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.432
that if I ever told a
story about my life,

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:12.167
I would call it
The American Story,

01:26:12.268 --> 01:26:14.903
because I think all of
it is very American,

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:17.273
even the drugs,
the psychedelics.

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:20.075
We have a lot of freedoms
here in this country,

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:23.612
and we exercised those
freedoms to the utmost,

01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:25.848
to experiment the
way that we did,

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:29.252
and to travel worldwide
and to take big risks.

01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:32.488
I think that's an American
story, I really do.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.864
- It's hard for
people to believe

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.766
that Eleonora and
could have lived

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.668
through the times we lived,

01:26:45.768 --> 01:26:47.703
and never been afraid.

01:26:56.745 --> 01:26:58.213
Loved his work.

01:26:58.314 --> 01:27:00.182
Crazy, yeah maybe.

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:02.818
No, it's because we believed.

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:04.052
We believed in
what we were doing,

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:05.954
and if we took us out,
'cause we were doing it,

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.456
we'd have been taken out.

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:08.991
It just didn't happen to us.

01:27:09.091 --> 01:27:11.026
It happened to a
lot of other people.

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:25.808
- We were outlaws, yes.

01:27:25.908 --> 01:27:28.010
We broke the law, you betcha.

01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:29.177
Laws were wrong.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:31.414
We have to break 'em
if they're wrong,

01:27:31.514 --> 01:27:34.950
because we had a goal of
wanting to turn on the world.

01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:42.325
Then in only 50 years,

01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:45.027
we have organic foods
in all kinds of places.

01:27:45.127 --> 01:27:47.029
The changes that have bloomed

01:27:47.129 --> 01:27:48.897
all around the world as a result

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:53.802
of taking people psychedelics.

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:57.440
I know for sure that
Steve Jobs took Sunshine.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.343
I know positively that
the guy that discovered

01:28:00.443 --> 01:28:03.278
the double helix DNA
was high on acid,

01:28:03.379 --> 01:28:07.983
and I'm pretty sure
it was Sunshine.

01:28:08.083 --> 01:28:12.688
What we were involved in
is human enlightenment.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.524
That's no small thing.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:20.195
I mean, 120 million
doses of acid.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.231
That's called turning
on the world, man.

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:26.268
(upbeat music)

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:46.321
* We are the nomadic kids

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:51.193
* And they can't take that away

01:28:51.293 --> 01:28:54.597
* We come with a message now

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:59.234
* It's fighting down away

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:02.270
* Some day old Sister Jude

01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:07.843
* Will be in a holy place

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:11.847
* Our brothers

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:14.182
* These kinda brothers

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:19.488
* Our brothers

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:22.525
(funky rock)

01:30:38.133 --> 01:30:39.267
* What's your name

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.569
* Orange Sunshine

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:41.770
* Do you want more

01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.739
* Yeah yeah

01:30:43.839 --> 01:30:45.440
(scatting)
