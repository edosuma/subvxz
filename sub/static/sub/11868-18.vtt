WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:05.251
Morning, SARAH.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.961
SARAH: Good morning,
Sheriff. Coffee?

00:07.090 --> 00:09.832
Yeah, two.
Um, one black and
one with milk and...

00:09.968 --> 00:12.254
Three teaspoons of sugar.
Yes, I know.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.048
Good memory, SARAH.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.672
I looked it in
the system preferences
after the third night.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.469
Yeah, but not that
you're counting, right?

00:22.981 --> 00:27.315
Oh, I could do that all day.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.856
Well, call in sick.
I can write a note
to your boss.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.148
Oh, you are the boss.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.067
(CHUCKLES)
Temporarily.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.486
And, as tempting
as that sounds,

00:35.619 --> 00:37.951
we're testing this new
supercollider at G.D. today,

00:38.080 --> 00:42.244
and if all goes well,
we actually could prove
the existence of dark energy.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.786
Oh, that old bag.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.707
Yeah, that old bag is
the key to understanding
the laws of the universe.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.922
You should come.
It's gonna be, ooh,
quite a show.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.087
It's not the kind of show
I care for.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.506
Okay, we can save
that show for later.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.469
Hey. Hands where
I can see 'em.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.718
Good morning, Zoe.

01:02.854 --> 01:03.809
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:03.939 --> 01:06.897
Um, okay,
I should probably go.
I'll see you later?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.014
See you later.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.891
Okay. Have a good day.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.155
Go ahead.
I know it's killing you.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.908
No, she's adorable.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.652
And plus, now
you can't give me grief
about Lucas.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.576
(LAUGHS) Yes, I can.
It's not the same thing.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.541
What's with the sweats?

01:26.670 --> 01:29.332
Dive meet at 1:00 for
Pilar's biotech final.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.329
Since when do you dive?

01:31.466 --> 01:33.752
Since I stupidly agreed
to be her guinea pig.

01:33.885 --> 01:38.094
Uh, novice divers controlled
by neural muscle remote.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.759
Wow.
You don't have to come.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.973
Are you kidding?
lwouldn't miss it.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.718
Oh, my God.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.844
What's wrong?

01:45.981 --> 01:47.141
I got offered
early admission

01:47.274 --> 01:50.061
to an undergrad
pre-med program
at Harvard.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.855
You... That's...
But that's not for,
like, two years.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.731
Well, I told you everyone
at Tesla applies early,

01:57.868 --> 02:02.077
and they only accept
a few people for admission,
and they picked me.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.366
But, I mean,
you have a 8- average.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.364
Yeah, which is like
an A+ in the real world.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.832
And it's not all about GPA.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.747
It says someone wrote
a letter on my behalf.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.915
They did?

02:11.048 --> 02:14.006
It starts next semester.
Can you believe it?

02:14.760 --> 02:18.594
Um, no. It's...
Uh, soon.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.837
SARAH: Are you okay, Sheriff?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.304
I'm picking up a spike
in your blood pressure.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.470
Yeah, I'm excited.
I mean, I'm freaked out,
but I'm excited.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.594
Oh, thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.140
Oh, I have to
go call Lucas.
Sure.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.809
It's amazing, right?
Yeah!

02:29.941 --> 02:30.896
Oh, my God.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.644
Yeah, (STAMMERING) it's huge.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.688
LUCAS: lt's devastating.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.611
We were going to apply
to the same schools.

02:40.744 --> 02:44.202
She is a special candidate,
and there was only one spot.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.738
l'm special.
Yes, you are.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.536
But it's notjust
about le, Lucas.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.830
And, besides, you know,
you can join her next year.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.544
(GROANS) This just
wasn't part of the plan.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.915
Well, life rarely goes
according to plan.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.838
I mean, take Kim's ship.
I lose it 20 years ago,

02:58.970 --> 03:00.881
and it returns
with enough data

03:01.014 --> 03:03.221
to unlock the secrets
of the universe,

03:03.350 --> 03:06.683
and | get to share it with
one of my best students.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.894
I appreciate
the opportunity, Dr. Deacon,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.934
but all the data
in the world

03:12.067 --> 03:14.274
can't take the place
of the woman you love.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.397
Hmm.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.529
I'm sorry.
I meant Zoe and me and...

03:19.658 --> 03:21.319
It's okay. Really.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.782
(SIGHS)

03:22.911 --> 03:23.866
(DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY)

03:23.995 --> 03:27.829
Whoa. Check out the scan
of our solar system
from Kim's data.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.789
Look at the distortion
on the northern edge
of the heliosphere.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.715
Could that be
what I think it is?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.252
Nemesis.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.175
It's not like
it's the end of
the world, Carter.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.885
Easy for you to say.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.515
This is an
amazing opportunity.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.801
You should be
proud of her.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.720
No, I am proud.
I just got blindsided.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.138
I thought we had
another year together.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.104
Hey, guys. Fresh muffins.
Get 'em while they're hot.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.517
I love Muffin Monday.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.765
I can't.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.313
SARAH said that
l have to watch
my blood pressure.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.778
The end of the world
is coming. The people
have a right to know.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.818
Mmm-hmm,
and with you around,
it'll end sooner than later.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.782
And that doesn't help.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.447
LARRY: You can't
do this, Fargo.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.695
lt's putting us all
at risk.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.412
Stop. Who did What?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.122
It's what they're
about to do.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.833
lgnore him.
It's not us this time.
It's Nemesis.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.293
Nemesis?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.170
Is that real, or is that
like a super villain

04:18.300 --> 04:19.915
from your fantasy
Justice League?

04:20.051 --> 04:23.885
Oh, it's real, and that
is an awesome name.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.796
Nemesis is a neutron star

04:25.932 --> 04:28.514
that's been theorized
to be in binary orbit
with our sun.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.350
lt crosses Earth's orbit
every 65 million years,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.141
causing an
extinction-level event.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.979
Like a killer asteroid?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.814
Oh, that's not even
the half of it.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.434
The tidal stresses
from the star's
gravitational pull

04:39.571 --> 04:41.687
could cause
a sudden reversal of
Earth's magnetic poles

04:41.823 --> 04:45.532
and unleash
earthquakes, tsunamis,
total global chaos.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.527
The world could
literally be turned
upside down.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.791
All right, um,
I'll check with Henry.
How much time do we have?

04:51.917 --> 04:55.375
If we're lucky,
maybe 2,000 years.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.172
Two thousand...

04:58.965 --> 05:01.752
See, that's not
so much a problem.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.752
So, next time,
don't bury the lead.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.048
Exactly, kids.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.137
Sheriff, the real
problem here is

05:08.266 --> 05:10.473
the supercollider
these guys are
about to test.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.763
lt'll wipe us out
long before Nemesis
gets the chance.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.352
Histrionic much, Larry?

05:14.481 --> 05:17.723
That thing makes the
Hadron Collider at CERN
look like a slingshot.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.646
Mark my words,
some things should
not be messed with.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.770
Like the laws of physics.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.981
For once,
Larry makes a fair point.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.740
So, the laws of physics
are in peril,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.157
my daughter's moving out,

05:32.290 --> 05:34.827
and the world's
coming to an end?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.748
I say, have the muffin.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.455
I'll have the muffin.

05:45.136 --> 05:49.129
TESS: Easy, Fargo,
that's a $10 billion
piece of equipment.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.222
You break it, you buy it.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.716
FARGO: All right,
that's it.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.559
Radio isotopes
are in place.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.849
Ready to smash some
unstable atoms together

05:56.982 --> 05:58.643
atneany
the speed of light?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.436
You know,
when he says it
like that,

06:00.569 --> 06:02.651
it doesn't sound
like a good idea.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.690
Okay, kids. Here we go.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.109
Isn't this exciting?
I mean, if we find
dark energy,

06:10.245 --> 06:12.782
we could prove
the existence of
the Higgs boson,

06:12.914 --> 06:14.950
discover the nature
of quark-gluon interaction,

06:15.083 --> 06:18.246
maybe even find
a true Unification Theory.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.915
I love it when
you talk nerdy to me.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.335
ZANE: Particle velocity's
at 0.50C.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.508
0.70.

06:28.972 --> 06:29.927
0.80.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.842
Should we be wearing
safety goggles or...

06:31.975 --> 06:33.966
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll protect you.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.101
0.90.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.767
What's happening?
(STAMMERING) I don't know.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.859
The field sensors
are off-scale.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.774
(BEEPING)
Whoa! Power surge
in the delivery arm.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.694
ZANE: The dampening rings
are destabilizing.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.986
Get down!

07:12.724 --> 07:14.589
(GASPING)

07:14.726 --> 07:15.681
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
You okay?

07:15.810 --> 07:16.765
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE) Yeah.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.260
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
Everyone okay?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.102
FARGO:
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE) Yeah.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.271
Why are we talking
like Chip and Dale?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.358
Uh, liquid helium cools
the magnets surrounding
the collider tunnel.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.772
The ring hit
the supply line.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.270
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
You think?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.443
l'll shut off the line
and open the surface vents.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.569
I knew we should have
worn safety goggles.
Safety goggles are good.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.956
Now, what the hell happened?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.367
Fargo happened.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.831
Hey, my part
went flawlessly.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.871
You must have screwed up
the containment
field calibration.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.210
I checked them
a dozen times.
They were spot on.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.001
Well, they're not now.
Yeah, take a look at that.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.880
But... But this
can't be right.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.252
(IN NORMAL VOICE) There was
a high-voltage spike

07:52.389 --> 07:53.845
in the damping
ring stabilizer.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.760
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Uh, and itjust snapped?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.884
No way. No way.
The stabilizer unit,
it's shielded.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.226
Something or
someone did this.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.720
TESS: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
But this is a critical test

08:01.856 --> 08:02.720
in proving
the laws of physics.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.688
Who would want to stop it?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.726
I think I might have an idea.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.895
Well, you can't say
I didn't warn you.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.942
That's why
we're here, Larry.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.109
(SCOFFS) You think I
messed with the collider?
Are you insane?

08:15.245 --> 08:16.610
Just following up
on leads.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.452
You seemed pretty vocal
about wanting to
shut it down.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.788
Hello?
Freedom of speech.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.123
Just because I thought
it was a stupid idea

08:22.252 --> 08:23.412
doesn't mean
l'd act on it.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.331
You did hijack Martha.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.715
One tiny lapse in judgment,

08:27.841 --> 08:28.876
and I never hear
the end of it.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.467
Truth is, I should file
a complaint against them.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.631
(LAUGHS)
For what exactly?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.470
Contaminating my experiment.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.845
My fem-bot prototype
was working perfectly...

08:39.978 --> 08:42.060
Do I really
want to know this?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.889
She was working perfectly
before I went to
get my coffee.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.891
When I came back after
the collider accident,

08:48.028 --> 08:51.987
she was completely
non-responsive.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.905
Maybe she's just
not that into you.

08:58.038 --> 09:03.908
How could the collider
affect your, um,
mechanical girlfriend?

09:05.211 --> 09:08.499
You think
they call it dark energy
because it's friendly?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.499
They have no idea
what it can do.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.475
The embedded
controller's fried.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.890
No wonder
the balance was off.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.857
I'm just glad
you're okay.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.982
Actually, Julia, I'm not.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.109
My brush with death
and this whole
Nemesis thing

09:32.238 --> 09:35.901
has made me realize
that life is short
and fate is cruel.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.149
Especially around here.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.992
There are so many things
I want to do before I die,

09:40.830 --> 09:43.788
and I know we haven't
been together for very long,

09:43.917 --> 09:47.284
but, um, I'd like to
do them with you.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.419
What did you
have in mind?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.501
I made a list.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.879
Feel free to add to it.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.763

Yeah, I figured Jo
could help us out
with that one.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.893
I mean,
she'd probably enjoy it.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.360
Fargo, what is that?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.151
No, it's an
incredible opportunity.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.871

a little more time.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.705
Okay. Bye.

a time share in Boca.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.335

10:31.923 --> 10:34.630
Actually, a job opportunity.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.343
After Allison gets back
from maternity leave,
I am officially unemployed.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.050
Yeah, what is it?

10:41.182 --> 10:44.891
A private funder is
building a new ultra-large
radio telescope array,

10:45.019 --> 10:46.930
and they need
someone to run it.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.475
Congratulations.
And where is it?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.854
Um, Australia.

Oh.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.898
That's far.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.534
And you're
considering it?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.159
Um, well, they made me
the job offer a week ago.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.792
Oh, so before you and l...

11:10.920 --> 11:11.875
Yeah.

You okay?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.966
(STAMMERING) You could have
mentioned it before.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.933
At the time it didn't have
anything to do with you.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.646
So...

11:33.943 --> 11:35.194
Right.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.776
Okay.

11:37.906 --> 11:43.822
Um, the collider accident
may have been more serious
than we thought.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.615
Larry says that dark energy
might be the cause.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.784
Okay. Well, first of all,
the accident was contained.

11:51.002 --> 11:54.665
You know,
I really have to deal
with this collider thing.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.128
Okay. Well,
don't worry about it.

or a Fargo anomaly.

you push this time?

Can you not
recognize a victim
when you see one?

12:50.186 --> 12:53.804
Well, you know, he's right.
There's nothing in this lab
that could cause that.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.890
Maybe he brought it in
with him from the lab
that recently exploded.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.857
The collider has nothing
to do with gravity.

12:58.987 --> 12:59.942
Well, how about dark energy?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.151
You said
you don't know
what that does yet.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.272
Well, I know that you
can't track it around
on your shoes.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.821
Guys? Can we maybe focus
on getting me down
before gravity returns?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.114
It's okay, honey,
lgotyou.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.038
You know what, Fargo?
Why don't you try just
pushing yourself away

from the ceiling?

you've been exposed to.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.823

but I want to talk

Okay, so, I'm not
gonna get electrocuted

you didn't tell me
about the pain.

I can't believe
this could be

not so sentimental.

Yeah, okay,
but everything
we do now

15:25.675 --> 15:27.882

accepted yet.
Look, it doesn't matter.

Okay, tell me you
figured out this
dark energy problem.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.522
Well, theoretically,
the power surge

16:28.654 --> 16:30.485
could have produced
a negatively charged
strangelet,

16:30.615 --> 16:35.200
or possibly a monopole,
or maybe even an itty,
bitty black hole.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.823
"ltty, bitty black hole"?

16:37.955 --> 16:41.789
Yeah, but none
of those things happened,
including a dark energy leak.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.918
Well, you seem
pretty certain.
How do you know?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.378
Because
the stabilizer froze.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.790
It broke down before
it even started.

No, no, no, actually,
he's quite anemic.

iron supplements
all of his life.

I mean, that fits.
Right?

Everything that was metal
got stuck to the ceiling.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.568
Wait, so Fargo was
a human magnet?

17:15.701 --> 17:18.283
Something produced
a wellspring of
electromagnetic energy,

17:18.412 --> 17:20.789
and I suppose
Fargo got caught up in it.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.951

collider break down?

17:23.084 --> 17:24.949

that my watch stopped.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.125

messed it up

17:30.258 --> 17:31.589
also messed up
the stabilizer?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.503
An intense electromagnetic
energy field

17:33.636 --> 17:34.842

your watch gears.

Not the real Nemesis.
A man-made copy.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.702
But the similarities
are remarkable.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.496
I mean, this growing
electromagnetic field

22:59.628 --> 23:02.244
has all the properties
of a massive magnetic
polar disturbance.

(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)
How massive are
we talking here?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.586
Hey, Jo, I'm sort of
in the middle of
something here.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.799
Yeah, so am I.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.795
All the metal
at Cafe Diem
just took up flying.

23:10.931 --> 23:11.716
It hit Cafe Diem.

23:11.849 --> 23:12.838
Tell her it's dissipating.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.806
Uh, it's dissipating.
Hang on, Jo.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.891

Never mind. We're good.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.400
Okay.
Keep me posted.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.151
So, Cafe Diem.
Where's it heading next?

23:34.288 --> 23:36.495
Well, there's no way to tell.
The magnetic field shows

23:36.624 --> 23:38.239
fluctuating energy
that comes and goes.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.785
It's the same effect
we see over time

23:39.919 --> 23:41.625
when the Earth's
magnetic poles reverse.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.086
But magnitude's
stronger and faster.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.079
Right now,
it's localized in Eureka.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.502
But if the energy
keeps building,
it won't be for long.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.127
If it's only happening here,
then someone here
must have caused it.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.677
So, what I need to know
is who could have created
a mini Death Star?

23:56.518 --> 24:00.352
Well, they would
have to have detailed
knowledge of Nemesis

24:00.481 --> 24:03.223
in order to
replicate the effect.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.478
Oh, please.
Give me a little credit.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.819
Credit. Maybe that's
what they wanted.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.739
Credit for what?
For starting an
extinction-level event?

24:15.871 --> 24:16.656
Or stopping one.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.450
I mean,
saving the world looks
pretty good on a resume.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.324
Yeah, but, Jack,
it's 2,000 years away.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.826
You know,
they would have to have
access to Henry's data.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.921
What kind of novice
would attempt something
so dangerous?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.755

It was my idea.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.527
Tell me
you're talking about
electromagnetic energy.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.370
Oh, I think she is.

25:43.709 --> 25:47.497
Is this
a micro-electromagnetic

25:47.629 --> 25:49.915
Uh, pulse amplifier.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.172

it's supposed to be.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.813
I mean, it worked.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.613
What is that?

26:24.875 --> 26:27.287
That is a new magnetic pole.

like the North Pole?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.083

26:32.216 --> 26:35.128
This is very, very bad.

26:41.809 --> 26:45.518
How in Bejesus' name
did you create
a new North Pole?

26:45.646 --> 26:46.977
Ignore the crazy man,
Lucas,

26:47.106 --> 26:49.267
and just talk us through it.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.525
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

26:50.651 --> 26:52.312
lu.lused
the data from Kim

26:52.444 --> 26:53.945
to build the simulation
of the forces

26:54.071 --> 26:56.357
that Nemesis would create
when it passed Earth.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.606
To measure
the relative change
in gravitational pull.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.449
Right. Then I designed the
electromagnetic amplifier

27:01.578 --> 27:03.239
to lock our planet's
poles in place

27:03.372 --> 27:04.908
so they wouldn't reverse.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.371
But my test failed.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.615
Well, not so much.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.958
There have been
magnetic problems
all over town,

27:10.087 --> 27:12.499
including what happened
to Zoe at the pool.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.165
But my amplifier
isn't even on now,

27:16.301 --> 27:17.962
and it's only
a scale model.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.757
It doesn't have
enough juice to cause
something like that.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.595
Unless there was
a boost in energy
from somewhere else.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.100
The explosion
from the collider.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.591
I think that your amplifier

27:25.727 --> 27:27.513
threw off the
magnetic stabilizers.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.182
And that surge
in electromagnetism

27:29.314 --> 27:30.815
fed back into
the strength of
the amplifier,

27:30.941 --> 27:32.556
creating a loop of
building energy.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.900
And, voila,
a new North Pole.

27:35.237 --> 27:37.899
I swear, I had no idea.

27:38.490 --> 27:42.278
Well, you are gonna
have to tell Santa

27:42.411 --> 27:44.777
that he needs to
move his workshop.

you thinking?

27:50.127 --> 27:51.708
That you were leaving.

27:53.755 --> 27:54.710
I couldn't handle it.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.673
I thought maybe if
I came up with a solution
to Nemesis,

27:57.801 --> 28:00.588
then Henry would write me
a recommendation letter

28:00.721 --> 28:03.588
like he did for you,
and then we could
go together.

by the Earth's own

Uh, can't move my legs.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.109
Or arms.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.823
The field is affecting
his nervous system.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.112
He's losing
muscle control.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.281
Hang on.
I'm going to help you up.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.585
(GROANING)

34:56.720 --> 34:58.676
Oh, I don't
like this at all.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.689
Oh! Oh!

35:11.818 --> 35:13.809
Jump! Jump!
Blondie, jump!

35:13.945 --> 35:15.560
Uh, hang on.

35:18.408 --> 35:21.946
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm just getting some
electromagnetic interference.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.576
Tess? We lost
the signal again.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.324
How will we know
when to launch?

35:31.046 --> 35:32.536
(ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
SPARKING)

35:46.519 --> 35:48.771
I'd say that's
a good sign.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.062
Oh! Ow!

35:57.572 --> 35:58.937
TESS: Oh, no.
What?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.905
They've launched
the drone.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.696
HENRY: You've got to
reverse the polarity
and get out of there.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.113
Martha's on her way.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.782
LUCAS: It's right
in front of you.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.377
(LAUGHING) Got it!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.341
There's a dial
on the left side
of the housing.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.177
Turn it clockwise
until it stops to
reverse the polarity.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.100
Come on, Tess.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.719
A little closer.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.434
I can feel my legs.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.107
It's working.
The amplifier's
weakening the field.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.572
Jack, Martha's
almost there. Run.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.237
(GRUNTS)

37:05.557 --> 37:07.513
Jack, are you there?

37:07.642 --> 37:08.757
Jack?

37:09.018 --> 37:11.851
Dad. Dad,
please say something.

37:15.692 --> 37:16.932
I need a vacation.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.564
(SIGHS)

37:20.697 --> 37:21.812
You did it, Jack.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.116
Yeah, I had a little help.

37:29.622 --> 37:30.748
I need a vacation.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.078
TESS: Bet you never thought
you'd be happy to
see them doing that, huh?

37:38.214 --> 37:41.422
Well, I'm not sure
if "happy" is quite
the right word.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.338
Well, we dodged
a major bullet today.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.132
Yeah. Yes,
and he helped.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.180
We also wouldn't
have needed help
if it wasn't for him.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.424
That's true.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.925
But what he created
will be essential

37:52.061 --> 37:54.643
to saving the planet
when the real
Nemesis comes.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.558
CARTER: You can
come up for air anytime.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.150
That was quite a day.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.818
Well, it's never dull.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.619
Yeah, that's what
makes this so hard.

38:11.706 --> 38:12.695
(SIGHS)

38:12.832 --> 38:15.699
And I'm sorry for
making it even harder.

38:17.754 --> 38:21.588
Jack, look,
the reason I didn't tell you
about the job offer

38:21.716 --> 38:24.753
was because I didn't know
what this was between us.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.303
It's the perfect job for you.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.511
I know that.

38:30.558 --> 38:33.721
And I've always wanted
to visit Australia. So...

38:36.439 --> 38:37.815
Then come with me.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.354
I can't come with you.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.519
Why not?

38:40.652 --> 38:43.109
Zoe's leaving. You know,
Jo can handle things here.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.355
Jack, we could
have something.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.737
Would you think about it?

38:50.745 --> 38:51.860
Okay.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.741
In the meantime,

38:56.084 --> 38:59.167
if you hate it,
you can come back.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.709
I can come back
even if! don't.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.292
Yeah, you can.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.804
(CHUCKLES)

39:15.895 --> 39:17.396
Sure this is all
gonna fit?

39:17.772 --> 39:21.264
Yeah, I'm making Lucas
pack all the spillover
in his car.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.434
Oh, so MlT did
end up taking him?

39:24.571 --> 39:26.402
Yeah, with Henry's
recommendation.

39:26.531 --> 39:29.523
You know, it turns out
the guy has a lot of pull.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.696
Well, ljust think
he knows talent
when he sees it.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.995
SARAH: I still can't
believe our little girl
is leaving home.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.910
Oh, SARAH, don't worry.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.328
The holidays will be here
before you know it.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.997
You sure
you don't want me
to come with you?

39:42.130 --> 39:44.246
It's sort of a dad's
rite of passage.
I could help. I...

39:44.382 --> 39:46.748
Yeah, I know, but, um...

39:48.177 --> 39:50.338
I think this is something
I have to do on my own.

39:50.847 --> 39:54.055
And besides, God knows
what havoc they'd wreak here
while you were gone.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.763
You know, I'm actually
really gonna miss it.

39:59.439 --> 40:02.146
Part of me
just kind of wants to
call the whole thing off.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.149
No. No, no, no, no.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.647
You're gonna do great.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.110
You really think so?

40:15.830 --> 40:16.865
I know so.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.875
Thank you.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.041
For what?

40:27.508 --> 40:31.092
For never giving up on me.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.297
That was an option?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.799
(LAUGHS) Oh!
You're hilarious.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.554
(LAUGHING)

40:44.192 --> 40:46.683
I am gonna miss you
like crazy.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.112
But I'm so proud.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.404
Well, you know,
if! hate it,

40:56.913 --> 40:58.278
I can come back.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.531
You can come back
even if you don't.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.503
(SIGHS)

41:07.632 --> 41:08.838
May I walk you out?

41:10.760 --> 41:11.920
Yeah.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.899
Hey. How you holding up?

41:37.328 --> 41:38.488
Um...

41:39.956 --> 41:41.696
l'm... I'm okay.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.831
Really?

41:45.378 --> 41:46.538
Um...

41:47.797 --> 41:49.833
I think sometimes
change is good.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.383
(JO CLEARING THROAT)

41:59.308 --> 42:02.675
l was about to grab
a Vinspresso.
You want to come?

42:04.480 --> 42:07.392
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
l'll catch up.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.520
Okay.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.645
Oh, and there was a package
that came for you. I...

42:14.449 --> 42:15.814
I put it on your desk.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.196
Okay.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.154
Yeah.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.578
(DOOR CLOSES)

42:55.698 --> 42:57.199
(PHONE RINGING)

43:02.288 --> 43:03.619
Jack Carter.

43:03.748 --> 43:04.783
Allison.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.953
Hey. Yeah. Um...

43:10.546 --> 43:12.082
l was just about to call you.
