I've seen bigger.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.328
Maybe we should chopper in
some strippers, huh?

01:25.419 --> 01:26.499
Amp up the party.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.955
Listen, I gotta ask you something
before we go on here.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.632
When you told me
the old man didn't want to hire me,

01:33.719 --> 01:35.584
did you mean that
or were you fucking with me?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.591
Spence, don't develop
a complex about it, okay?

01:37.682 --> 01:39.263
-| just need to know.
-No, no, he loves you.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.681
Believe me, he's a big fan.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.554
ljust did that to, you know, rile you up.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.636
-Stoke your fire a little.
-Well, you stoked the fuck out of it.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.765
Okay, then I did great.

01:53.823 --> 01:54.983
What, do you guys got sunstroke?

01:55.074 --> 01:56.985
Take off your shoes. Put 'em in the thing.

Good to see you. You remember Spencer.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.498
Mr. Anderson. Thanks for seeing us.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.457
-Yeah, the football guy.
-Right.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.134
Not as big as I thought you'd be.

02:18.723 --> 02:21.965
So, did you guys bring me anything?

02:22.059 --> 02:26.473
Or did you come here to,
you know, polish my vessel?

02:26.939 --> 02:28.440
We've decided to make a push.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.139
We're gonna hold a corporate event,

02:30.234 --> 02:31.895
bring more high-income athletes
to the company.

02:31.986 --> 02:32.975
It's about fucking time.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.527
And you, I thought we lost you
to the NFL Network or something.

02:35.614 --> 02:36.990
Nah, not my style.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.814
We just signed Vernon Littelfield.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.321
That deal's gonna be huge.
He's a very popular guy around the league.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.867
So between those two and my connections,

02:49.962 --> 02:52.669
we can establish a very unique brand
and grow the company.

May | ask you something?
Why am ljust hearing about this

02:55.134 --> 02:58.672

there might be something more to it than that.

And lose my cred with the team?
Not a chance.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.621
But the story is floating around,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.829
and if it goes public, he'll have to finish
his career in Saskatchewan.

and it's partly my fault.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.665

You understand what I'm saying?

10:00.768 --> 10:03.009
Man, you take away
that helmet and the jersey,

10:03.103 --> 10:07.267
I'm just a big dude
who works down at the Chevy dealership.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.814
You're depressing the hell out of me, man.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.183
(CHEERING)

10:14.865 --> 10:16.856
MAN: He's sweatin' over there, y'all.

10:18.994 --> 10:19.983
Let's do it. Let's do it.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.864
-$400.
-Put 'em down.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.745
That's five.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.368
You guys mind if I play?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.835
-Nigga, do you even have any bread?
-No, I don't.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.288
I just got a shitload of money
that I wanna lose.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.883
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

10:33.967 --> 10:36.083
-Okay. Okay.
-Time's up?

10:36.178 --> 10:39.966
Yeah, okay, all right. Wait.
These aren't loaded, are they?

10:40.057 --> 10:41.046
(LAUGHS)

10:42.976 --> 10:45.137
(ALL CHEERING)

10:45.229 --> 10:48.016
Tracy said there's a story
brewing about the fight.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.313
-Alonzo ratted me out.
-No, anonymous tip.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.563
Yeah, well, this anonymous asshole say
he put my shit in the cold tub?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.519
-Treating you like a rookie?
-Can you believe that shit?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.445
All I did was offer to buy Alonzo's number.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.070
Guys do it all the time. You know this.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.242
Look, what you need to do, honestly,
is bury that bone again.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.614
Maybe she buries the story.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.491
Oh, ljust sling D and everything goes up?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.573
-That's right, babe, sling it. It'll fix everything.
-(LAUGHS)

11:07.668 --> 11:09.374
She ain't gonna run the story.
It's not her style.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.419
But the problem is
somebody will run the story.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.752
They're always making shit out
to be worse than it is.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.004
Come here, brother. Talk to me. I'm your boy.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.461
What's going on between you two?

11:20.556 --> 11:22.262
I'm telling you, man,
if Alonzo's got some kind of beef,

11:22.349 --> 11:23.384
that's his fucking problem.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.090
Right, but when you try
to feed him your Jordans,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.595
then it's our problem. (LAUGHS)

11:26.687 --> 11:29.053
Well, you know what?
Come on, man, it's a party. All right?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.559
Life is too short to be walking around
in a bad mood all the time.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.060
-I'm not in a bad mood.
-You sure?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.187
I'm sure, brother.
ljust wish you'd spend as much time

11:35.279 --> 11:36.860
thinking about your actions as I do.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.858
(LAUGHS) All right, well, you should
think less and live more.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.531
-We only go around once.
-Stop charming me.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.949
(ALL CHEERING)

11:45.664 --> 11:46.699
Shit!

11:46.790 --> 11:48.997
So, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let me get this straight.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.915
You take a booze cruise to a tittie bar?

11:51.003 --> 11:55.918
No, no, no, the tittie bar is on the boat.
We call that shit the motorboat.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.293
(BLUBBERING)

11:58.135 --> 12:00.626
That's the best idea I've ever heard, man.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.884
Boating, booze, and boobs,
the holy trinity of fun.

World star, bitches.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.275
How's life in the real world, Spence?
You still dreaming about laying people out?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.522
Nah, let me tell you something, Dan.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.071
Right now my dreams
are all about deals and dollars.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.399
It's hard to lay people out
when you're aiming for their kneecaps.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.279
Oh, is that your
professional opinion, Reggie?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.235
Well, hell, you never saw the Buffalo game.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.908
-What was that, 2000...
-Eight.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.955
2008, you never saw that one, did you?

12:31.043 --> 12:32.624
The Balsamo hit. Brutal.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.327
I don't collect scalps,
but that one's right up there.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.004
Okay, I'm amazed either one of you two
walked off the field after that hit.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.297
Look at him now in one piece,

12:39.384 --> 12:41.420
destined for success
in financial management.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.251
-Hear, hear.
-You look beautiful.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.929
-(CHUCKLES) Thank you, Jay.
-You'd make a hell of a GM, Spence.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.756
You got compassion, people skills.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.594
I appreciate that, Coach. Just give me
a pair of wraparounds and a visor. (LAUGHS)

12:51.688 --> 12:54.145
No,no,no.
Don't want to have to negotiate with this guy.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.517
-You won't have to.
-Good.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.395
What is the endgame here, though, Spence?

12:57.486 --> 12:59.192
Is it agent? Broadcaster? Coach?

12:59.279 --> 13:02.863
Man, you're such a star,
why not own a damn team while you're at it?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.362
Well, Ifigured
if Venus and Serena could do it,

13:06.453 --> 13:07.613
own a piece of the Dolphins, why can't I?

13:07.704 --> 13:08.739
Magic and Jordan did it.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.161
Getting your profit off the crop ain't enough?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.863
You want to own the whole damn plantation.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.745
Now I know your bell been rung.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.086
Who is this asshole?

13:15.170 --> 13:16.626
You know,
why don't you give it a rest, Reggie?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.374
Excuse me, boys. Duty calls.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.670
Hey, Spencer.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.967
Hey.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.674
I got a proposition.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.505
Oh, I'm giddy with anticipation.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.977
I want a real stake in Vernon.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.224
I mean, I'm not trying to get squeezed out,
end up his personal valet.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.225
I want to be invested like you.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.558
You get 3% of, what, every dollar you handle?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.143
I'll take one of those.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.646
(CHUCKLES)

13:43.740 --> 13:46.231
-You'|l take one?
-Oh, and you'll give one.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.442
I mean, I would ask you
for a suitcase full of money,

13:48.537 --> 13:51.199
but I don't think you have any left,
Mr. Franchise Owner.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.248
(CHUCKLES) So think on it.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.085

14:13.603 --> 14:15.184
You've got to be kidding me.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.684
No, it's not funny. It's cruel.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.765
Look, I wouldn't touch this shit
with a 10-foot pole,

14:19.860 --> 14:22.977
but the tabloids will have a field day.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.858
There's no proof, right? It's just hearsay?

I don't want to hear about none of you
tomorrow morning

14:45.343 --> 14:49.131

14:50.974 --> 14:53.932
I repeat, do not fuck up.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.010
Clear, Coach. We ain't gonna fuck up.
We got you.

I never worry about
a sweetheart like you, Jerret.

-The party is a success. Almost perfect.
-Mmm.

Almost? Man, we turned up in this bitch.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's Kara, my interior designer.

-She's beautiful.
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.200

Get the... No, no, no, no.
She doesn't wear a ring and neither does he.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.377
She doesn't wear a ring
'cause that's not Alonzo's wife.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.591
She's his mom.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.764
Yeah.

Motherfucker.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.725
Yes, that is in fact you.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.983
Man, I got to get me one of these bad boys.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.230
The upkeep alone would cost you millions.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.981
You got to crew it, maintain it, gas it.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.906
This thing drinks five gallons a mile.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.404
Joe knows boats.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.159
That I do.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.998

16:46.089 --> 16:47.499
-You did?
-Yeah. Not like this.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.924
This is... This is barely...
This is like a fucking spaceship.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.672
But she was pretty damn sweet, man.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.844
-I loved that boat.
-So why'd you lose it?

16:54.931 --> 16:58.264
Sometimes the things we love
aren't long for this world, Vern.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.681
Especially when your alcoholic ex-wife
gets drunk

17:01.771 --> 17:04.262

-What?
-I think he crying, Nate.

-No, it'sjust the weed. I'm not crying.
-You tripping, Joe.

-No, really.
-I'm over it.

Hey, hey, Joe. Joe, your yacht is amazing.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.722
Thank you. You should see my other yacht.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.808
I would show that to you,
but I loaned it to Prince

17:49.903 --> 17:51.393

-Two, and a half.
-Okay.

17:58.662 --> 17:59.822
I went down on her in the kitchen.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.370
She put in these gorgeous
quartz countertops.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.080
Please tell me you did not know who she was.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.909
Oh, man, her last name isn't even Cooley.
I got her card in my wallet.

This is not good.
You're gonna have to apologize to Alonzo.

18:09.881 --> 18:10.916
Why should I?

Because you have gone in where he came out.

Kara is a grown-ass woman.
More grown than I thought, but it is what it is.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.764
She is Alonzo's mother.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.136
Okay? That's a line we don't cross.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.344
No wives, no moms.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.144

so we can stop the bleeding.

-I like her.

they'll tell you
that I conduct myself accordingly.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.884

And would every one of these players tell me
it's okay to bang their morn?

Chill out, man.
These honeys, man, they are DTF. Okay, man?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.683
Listen, I can't handle all these girls by myself.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.814
-You got it. You're good.
-Come on, baby.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.191
-I love you, Miami!
-(CHEERING)

20:00.200 --> 20:02.657
I mean, I guess I could stay
a little while longer.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.156
-Yeah, man, you don't want to be rude.
-Exactly.

20:05.455 --> 20:09.414

GIRLS: G0!

20:23.640 --> 20:26.131
Charles! Charles! GO, Charles!

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

20:58.466 --> 20:59.797
My man V.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.169
(WHOOPING)

21:01.386 --> 21:02.375
(LAUGHING)

21:03.805 --> 21:06.512
Oh, my God. Let's play Truth or Dare.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.849
And we can... You guys can be my...
You guys can be sister wives.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.302
We'll have orgies all the time.

21:12.397 --> 21:16.140
That you get the highest
if you put it right up your asshole.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.966
-Get back here, you.
-No.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.470
You know, me and your son
are on the same team.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.427
Ain't that a conflict Of interest?

21:55.482 --> 21:58.269
Oh. 'ZO's had plenty of fun with my friends.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.771
-NO reason I can't have fun with his.
-(CLICKING TONGUE)

22:00.862 --> 22:03.148
Me and Alonzo are not friends.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.072
Me and Alonzo are teammates.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.525
Okay, teammates that wind up
being like brothers,

22:08.620 --> 22:12.158
which makes our thing extra fucked up,
now that I think about it.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.579
Ricky, Ricky, listen to me.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.951
I don't talk about who my son is

22:15.043 --> 22:17.659
because I want to be taken seriously
in the design world,

22:18.171 --> 22:21.755
and I'd come off like I'm using his name
to get ahead.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.717
Yeah, I mean, I get that.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.089
But I also get why he'd be so upset.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.263
Yeah, 'Zo's always been the sensitive one.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.760
Oh, whoa, whoa.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.887
Sensitive one?

22:33.978 --> 22:35.434
Well, yeah.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.264
I mean, his brothers aren't nearly
as thin-skinned,

22:38.358 --> 22:39.347
and his sisters...

22:41.653 --> 22:43.109
Tough as nails.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.236
How many kids you got?

22:49.786 --> 22:50.775
(LAUGHING)

22:51.788 --> 22:53.119
You good, Charles?

22:53.206 --> 22:55.288

23:05.635 --> 23:06.750
What's up, Chucky?

23:07.262 --> 23:09.173

-I'm gonna go find my shirt.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.385
-You hit 'em?
-Yeah, I hit 'em, all right.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.387
-I made two grand rolling dice.
-What?

23:15.478 --> 23:17.560
-And I got three verbal commitments.
-Wow!

23:17.647 --> 23:19.103
These guys fucking love me.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.647
-You're feeling it?
-Yeah! Yeah.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.599
We are cementing our brand.

23:23.695 --> 23:27.153
Yeah, Anderson Financial,
get rich, get laid, have fun.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.320
Put that on the letterhead.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.815

23:29.909 --> 23:31.524
Yeah, later we'll do that.
Let's get some drinks.

23:31.619 --> 23:32.699
Let me handle some business real quick.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.072
-I'Il meet you over there.
-Yeah, all right.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.905
-Tequila.
-GO, go, go, go. Tequila.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.035
Excuse me.

23:38.126 --> 23:40.617
Ricky Ross in the house.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.954
-Oh, here come Mr. Flimflam Man.
-Oh.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.163
How's the swindle?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.593
Uh, you know, I've been thinking about
what you said.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.133
I think I might remember
what you're talking about.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.381
But then again, I might not.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.428
You're trying to bait me, Reg.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.223
You see, I give you a point
and then you go run and tell Vernon

23:56.311 --> 23:58.097
that I tried to buy you Off.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.769
See, here's the truth, brother,
I don't have to buy you Off.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.223
And I won't go for your knees.

24:03.318 --> 24:05.229
No, no, no. I'll go right through you.

24:05.320 --> 24:08.528
Real talk right now, man.
LOOk, I know that you gave Vernon 300 grand

24:08.615 --> 24:10.025
so that you could
try to wring something out of it.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.108
Okay, well, real talk right now.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.863
The only reason why you're still in the mix

24:15.371 --> 24:17.407
is because Vernon feels
he owes you something.

24:17.498 --> 24:18.874
But he doesn't owe you shit.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.825
See, Vernon blew up more than you
or anybody else could ever imagine.

24:21.919 --> 24:22.999
But I want you to think about this.

24:23.087 --> 24:26.579
There's no shame in having me come in
and help manage that.

24:26.674 --> 24:30.542
I'm not gonna let you or anybody else
use my man Vernon.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.551
Okay.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.213
But I'm still gonna do what I gotta do.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.718
I won't let you take them, man.

24:37.852 --> 24:42.437
Vernon, Mama, Marcus, Nate. The whole crew.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.147
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.316
Hey, listen, man, you can't steal my family

24:47.403 --> 24:50.816
just 'cause you adopted
and ain't got one Of your own.

24:54.744 --> 24:55.950
The fuck did you just say to me?

24:56.037 --> 24:57.652
I try and do the right thing
and this is what you do?

24:57.747 --> 24:59.362
-This what I dO.
-You stir the shit

24:59.457 --> 25:01.243
and you make things harder than it should be.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.325
-Is this how you take care of your family?
-Calm down with that.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.501
That's how you take care... You need me!

25:05.922 --> 25:06.911

-Shit!

25:14.555 --> 25:17.171
-Oh, shit, man.
-Oh, shit.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.255
Reg, come here, brother.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.262
Get the fuck away from me, man.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.351
Yeah, y'all saw what he did, right?

25:26.442 --> 25:28.694
This the kind Of psycho
you want taking care Of your money?

25:28.778 --> 25:30.314
Your futures?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.699

25:38.121 --> 25:40.453
You go ahead and make
that two points now, big boy.
