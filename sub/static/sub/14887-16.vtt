12:10.964 --> 12:14.735
Cousin, I can read you
like a scroll.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.539
You're not fasting.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.373
You're avoiding Vince.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.375
You still don't trust him.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.911
Cousin, the way you're acting

12:24.945 --> 12:25.979
I wouldn't be surprised

12:26.012 --> 12:28.414
if he's the last
prisoner we ever get.

12:30.116 --> 12:34.821
Balki, it's hard to trust a man
who might kill me in my sleep.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.257
But, cousin,
you're not even trying.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.961
I don't think you really believe
Vince is a changed man.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.162
Bingo.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.766
Don't change the subject.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.235
Balki, the man
threatened to kill me.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.873
Well, he threatened me, too,
but I trust him.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.011
‐ How do you do that?
‐ Cousin, it's easy.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.046
You‐you just, you know

13:00.080 --> 13:01.414
trust him a little bit

13:01.447 --> 13:03.550
and then you trust him
a bit more

13:03.584 --> 13:05.451
and then you trust him
a lot more.

13:06.587 --> 13:07.988
You can start small.

13:08.589 --> 13:10.256
Loan him your car.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.329
Hi, guys.
Boy, life is good.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.430
You know, they let me
in the building

13:17.463 --> 13:18.565
without a strip‐search.

13:20.166 --> 13:20.967
[Balki]
Hi, Vince.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.869
‐ Ready to go to lunch?
‐ Oh, you bet.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.805
I could kill
for a chili dog, right now.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.307
Cousin? Coming?

13:28.274 --> 13:29.843
Yeah. Sure.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.245
Why not?
I tell you what, Vince.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.247
[keys jingling]

13:34.280 --> 13:35.516
Why don't you drive?

13:35.549 --> 13:37.183
Oh, thanks.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.452
It'll be good to drive again.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.254
Hey, you guys
ever see the car chase

13:41.287 --> 13:42.288
in "The French Connection?"

13:48.261 --> 13:51.064
[instrumental music]

13:55.435 --> 13:57.370
Ah‐ha‐ah‐huh, no trouble,
Mr. Denagree.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.172
I‐I'm still starting
work tomorrow.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.544
[dramatic music]

14:03.577 --> 14:06.279
I just need some
photography advice.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.615
I want to take a picture
of the guys I'm staying with.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.383
You know, frame it,
then give it to 'em

14:10.416 --> 14:11.384
as a gift for being
so nice to me.

14:12.653 --> 14:15.255
[Vince]
But I want it
to be a surprise.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.258
But the problem is every time
I try to get a shot off

14:18.291 --> 14:20.226
this one guy Larry
is watching me.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.498
Well, I‐well, I thought about

14:25.532 --> 14:26.900
shooting them
in their sleep, but...

14:29.570 --> 14:31.605
[Vince]
I really wanted
their eyes to be open.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.677
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're probably right.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.545
It, uh, won't be
much of a surprise

14:38.579 --> 14:40.280
but at least it will
get the job done.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.417
I'll just sit them down
tomorrow morning

14:44.450 --> 14:45.451
and shoot them both.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.123
Thanks, boss.
I'll see you later.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.026
[dramatic music]

14:55.161 --> 14:56.162
[Vince clears throat]

15:03.637 --> 15:06.172
Balki. Balki, wake up.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.542
We've got to get out of here.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.343
Vince is going to kill us.

15:11.712 --> 15:13.547
Now, cousin,
you had a bad dream.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.948
Go back to bed.

15:17.718 --> 15:19.319
Balki, I'm serious.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.456
Vince is going to shoot us
first thing tomorrow morning.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.559
Are you sure?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.294
He told me himself
he's not a morning person.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.031
Balki.

15:31.732 --> 15:32.933
Balki.

15:33.634 --> 15:34.635
Balki!

15:36.369 --> 15:37.738
I'm not making this up.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.706
I believe in what
you're trying to do with Vince

15:39.740 --> 15:42.709
I really do,
but it's not working!

15:42.743 --> 15:45.478
I just heard Vince on the phone
planning our murders.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.715
Cousin, are you sure?

15:48.749 --> 15:50.316
This never happened on Mypos.

15:51.685 --> 15:55.021
Our two arsonists
were perfect guests.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.323
Of course we couldn't barbecue
when they were there.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.163
Balki.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.598
I'm sure the criminals on Mypos

16:04.631 --> 16:06.733
are a darn fine
bunch of people.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.435
Unfortunately, Vince is a lemon.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.337
No. I think he's a Pisces.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.009
I mean, he hasn't reformed.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.378
But he's been so nice to us.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.146
Lots of killers are nice.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.115
Lizzie Borden
was homecoming queen.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.085
Oh, hi, guys.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.053
Vince, you're up.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.089
Yeah, been up for a while,
I couldn't sleep.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.725
I had a nightmare.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.460
The same one I've had
ever since I went to prison.

16:35.796 --> 16:38.131
Well, we all have bad dreams.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.734
Why don't we turn in
and think happy thoughts.

16:42.536 --> 16:43.637
You know, it's a funny thing.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.372
But, uh, you two
were in my dream.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.274
Get out of the city!

16:48.308 --> 16:49.475
We were in your dream?

16:51.211 --> 16:53.647
It's just the three of us
in this room with no doors.

16:54.548 --> 16:56.316
Just like solitary

16:56.349 --> 16:59.185
except I don't have
the straitjacket on.

17:05.726 --> 17:07.728
Did you ever have the dream
where you couldn't run?

17:11.765 --> 17:13.800
Well, the dream always
happens the same way.

17:13.834 --> 17:16.703
Uh, I talk real nice to you

17:16.737 --> 17:18.638
tell you a few jokes.

17:18.672 --> 17:22.407
Then, then we're laughing
and having fun

17:22.442 --> 17:23.743
I grab you!

17:23.777 --> 17:25.310
Then with my bare hands

17:25.345 --> 17:28.114
I squeeze your necks
tighter and tighter

17:28.147 --> 17:30.784
feeling the bones
crack under my thumbs

17:30.817 --> 17:34.254
feeling the life drain from
your pathetic little bodies.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.461
Oh, sorry, uh...

17:44.197 --> 17:45.331
Did you ever have a nightmare

17:45.365 --> 17:46.600
that was so real that you felt

17:46.633 --> 17:48.268
that you were living it?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.614
Well...

18:05.385 --> 18:06.452
Well...

18:14.460 --> 18:15.862
Well...

18:20.734 --> 18:23.670
It's been fun
reminiscing like this...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.274
...but I think I'll turn in.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.143
Before you go, Larry

18:30.176 --> 18:32.478
I got something I was gonna
wait until the morning to do

18:32.513 --> 18:34.447
but since we're all up

18:34.480 --> 18:35.649
I might as well do it now.

18:36.917 --> 18:37.884
I'll be right back.

18:40.921 --> 18:42.355
We'll be right here.

18:44.525 --> 18:45.726
[grunting]

18:47.661 --> 18:50.330
[both grunting]

18:55.869 --> 18:57.237
‐ What's going on?
‐ Going on?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.605
Nothing's going on,
is there, Balki?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.741
No, no. Nothing's going on.

19:00.774 --> 19:02.208
We were just...

19:02.242 --> 19:03.376
...measuring ourselves.

19:04.745 --> 19:07.213
Oh, cousin, you've‐you've
shot up an inch.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.489
What you got there, Vince?

19:16.523 --> 19:17.591
You'll see.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.292
Now, this ain't going
to hurt a bit.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.894
Stand over there.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.684
Now's our chance. Grab him!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.853
[grunting]

19:46.887 --> 19:49.289
[camera shutter clicks]

19:50.891 --> 19:52.458
I've been hit.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.897
Getting shot
isn't as bad as I thought.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.868
Just a flash of
light and then...

20:01.902 --> 20:03.403
...your mind shuts down.

20:07.307 --> 20:11.444
Cousin, Vince
don't have a gun gun.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.714
Vince has a flash gun.

20:13.747 --> 20:15.582
Just like yours.

20:15.616 --> 20:16.750
Look.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.386
Very nice.

20:22.055 --> 20:22.923
Well, why would I have a gun?

20:22.956 --> 20:24.490
It would be
a violation of my parole.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.728
Well, Cousin Larry thought

20:27.761 --> 20:29.630
that he heard you on the phone

20:29.663 --> 20:31.565
telling someone
you were going to shoot us.

20:33.634 --> 20:36.269
I was talking to the guy
I'm gonna to work for.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.438
I wanted to shoot
a picture of you.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.674
You know, frame it
and give it to you

20:40.707 --> 20:42.375
as a way of paying you back

20:42.408 --> 20:44.377
for all the things
you've, you've done for me.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.913
Oh.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.352
Oh, no.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.923
Oh, Vince, I‐I feel... awful.

20:56.957 --> 20:58.692
I am so sorry.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.395
I don't know what to say.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.432
You guys thought
I was going to shoot you?

21:06.466 --> 21:07.934
Balki didn't.

21:07.968 --> 21:09.435
He‐he had faith in you.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.004
He trusted you
right from the beginning.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.006
This is... all my fault.

21:13.574 --> 21:14.875
I...

21:16.442 --> 21:19.345
God, Vince, can you,
can you ever forgive me?

21:20.547 --> 21:22.516
You thought
I was gonna shoot you...

21:22.549 --> 21:23.850
...with a gun?

21:24.585 --> 21:25.586
Yes.

21:25.619 --> 21:26.920
[laughing]

21:26.953 --> 21:28.354
This is great!

21:28.388 --> 21:29.656
A gun! I love it!

21:31.391 --> 21:33.493
You know, I‐I haven't laughed

21:33.527 --> 21:35.061
this much since
the "Newhart" show.

21:35.095 --> 21:39.600
Not the new one the old one with
Suzanne Pleshette. Ha ha ha.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.101
This is great. Ha ha ha.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.673
You know...

21:46.707 --> 21:48.341
...I might actually
be able to sleep now.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.577
[Vince]
Goodnight, guys.

21:50.611 --> 21:53.413
I'll, uh... shoot
that picture in the morning.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.556
Booga booga! Ha ha ha.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.991
You guys kill me! Ha ha ha!

22:08.562 --> 22:11.331
[instrumental music]

22:18.438 --> 22:20.073
[Larry]
Balki...

22:20.106 --> 22:22.042
...guess what came
in the mail today.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.910
Vince sent us
the picture he took of us.

22:23.944 --> 22:26.513
‐ Oh, cousin, isn't that nice!
‐ Yeah.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.383
Just goes to show you
what a little trust can do.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.019
Okay, I admit

22:33.053 --> 22:35.622
I was a little
skeptical at first

22:35.656 --> 22:38.959
but from now on Larry Appleton
will go out of his way

22:38.992 --> 22:40.761
will bend over backwards

22:40.794 --> 22:43.463
will walk that extra mile
to help his fellow man

22:43.496 --> 22:45.398
back on the straight
and narrow path.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.400
Oh, cousin. That's nice.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.536
I think Willie will be
happy to hear that.

22:51.705 --> 22:54.575
Willie? Willie who?

22:54.608 --> 22:56.442
Oh, Willie the Weasel.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.478
He and Vince were
roommates in prison.

22:58.512 --> 23:01.481
And so, I invited him to come
and stay here when he gets out.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.149
Balki...

23:03.183 --> 23:05.485
You know, the thing is
I'm not sure when he's coming.

23:05.519 --> 23:09.489
Because he said after
he goes over the wall

23:09.523 --> 23:13.994
then he has to lay low
until the heat dies down.

23:14.027 --> 23:17.130
So I guess that means
we'll see him...

23:17.163 --> 23:19.465
...early fall?

23:19.499 --> 23:22.435
[instrumental music]

23:26.039 --> 23:27.808
