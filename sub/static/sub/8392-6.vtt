WHEN I'M GONNA BE BACK.

09:05.610 --> 09:06.918
IT MIGHT BE DAYS.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.291

09:30.050 --> 09:31.278
[cheers]

09:31.320 --> 09:32.799
[laughter]

09:32.840 --> 09:34.353

09:34.400 --> 09:36.186
I OWE HER 50 BUCKS.

09:36.230 --> 09:39.017
- YOU KNOW I'M GONNA COLLECT.
THAT IS SO COOL.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.197
- THAT'S BETTER
THAN A PROMOTION.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.959
IS IT BORN YET?

09:41.990 --> 09:43.639
- NO, HE'S...

09:43.680 --> 09:45.022

09:48.000 --> 09:50.059

FINALLY CAME THROUGH.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.374
- UM, NO.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.992
THE AGENCY WAS NOT QUITE
VERY HELPFUL AT ALL.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.827
- YOU SWITCHED AGENCIES.

09:56.870 --> 09:58.656
- HOW'D YOU GET HOOKED UP
WITH THE BABY THEN?

09:58.700 --> 10:00.793
- UM...

10:00.840 --> 10:03.934
THERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WORKS AT MY OFFICE

10:03.980 --> 10:05.311
WHO IS PREGNANT.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.043
SHE ACT UALLY--
SHE WORKS AT THE COFFEE CART.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.390
AND SHE IS NOT KEEPING
THE BABY.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.705
AND WE ARE ADOPTING IT.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.126
- WOW.
- SO IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.775
- A COFFEE CART.
- YOU'RE GETTING A BABY

10:15.820 --> 10:17.082
FROM A COFFEE CART.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.097
DO YOU KNOW HER?

10:18.130 --> 10:19.199
- YOU KNOW WHAT, WE--

10:19.230 --> 10:20.299
- YES.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.989
- TYPICALLY
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

10:22.030 --> 10:24.089
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PARENTS AT ALL.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.131
- RIGHT.
- BUT THE AGENCY KNOWS.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.922
USUALLY.
I MEAN, THEY KNOW SOMETHING.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.109
THEY HAVE BACKGROUND.

10:30.140 --> 10:31.869
- RIGHT.
- SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD,

10:31.900 --> 10:33.242
THOUGH, DOESN'T IT?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.168
- IT'S DIFFERENT.
- IT'S NOT WEIRD.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.837
- NO.
- BUT YOU HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

10:38.870 --> 10:39.973
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YEAH.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.899
SHE'S AGREED TO LET US ADOPT
HER CHILD.

10:42.950 --> 10:45.043
- LOVELY GIRL.
WE'VE HAD HER OVER HERE.

10:45.090 --> 10:46.045
- SHE ASK YOU FOR MONEY?

10:46.090 --> 10:47.773
- NO.
WE...

10:47.810 --> 10:49.983
WE'RE COVERING
HER MEDICAL EXPENSES,

10:50.020 --> 10:52.124
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY
IN OUR BEST INTEREST.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.957
- AND YOU'RE SURE
THAT SHE'S PREGNANT?

10:53.990 --> 10:56.049
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:56.100 --> 10:58.261
- THAT'S A VALID QUESTION.

10:58.310 --> 10:59.379
SHE'S DEFINITELY PREGNANT.

10:59.410 --> 11:00.718
SHE'S DEFINITELY--
- OKAY--

11:00.760 --> 11:02.307
- I'VE BEEN TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH HER.

11:02.350 --> 11:04.204
- IT'S STUFF
YOU GOT TO ASK, YOU KNOW.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.105
- NO, WE HAVE ASKED.

11:06.140 --> 11:08.074
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF IT.

11:08.110 --> 11:10.078
SO...

11:15.010 --> 11:16.830
- WHAT?
- WHAT IS THAT?

11:16.880 --> 11:18.495
- WHAT?
- FEELS LIKE PAPER.

11:18.530 --> 11:20.225
[gaSPSI
BUSTED.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.943
YOU'VE BEEN SMOKING?

11:21.990 --> 11:23.503
IS THIS A NEW PLAYWRIGHT?

11:23.540 --> 11:25.223
- I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT.

11:25.270 --> 11:27.431
- SMOKING IN BED,
THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.927
- THEY'RE NOT MINE.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.097
SO...

11:31.130 --> 11:32.757
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:32.790 --> 11:34.371
- IT'S...

11:34.410 --> 11:35.968
- WHOSE ARE THEY?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.060
- THEY'RE SETH'S.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.793
- UM...
- LET ME EXPLAIN.

11:40.830 --> 11:44.004
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:44.040 --> 11:47.350
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU THIS,
AND WE JUST GOT DISTRACTED.

11:47.390 --> 11:49.210
HE GOT--
HE WAS VERY DRUNK.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.739
HE GOT IN A FIGHT.
HE CALLED ME.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.010
I WENT TO GET HIM.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.041
AND HE JUST--
I JUST BROUGHT HIM BACK HERE

11:54.090 --> 11:55.114
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
- AND HE SLEPT HERE,

11:55.160 --> 11:56.491
AND WHERE DID YOU SLEEP?

11:56.540 --> 11:58.121
- IT WAS JUST TO SOBER UP,

11:58.160 --> 11:59.434
AND I SLEPT HERE
IN MY CLOTHES.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.812
- NEXT TO HIM.
- ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.125
YEAH.
- OKAY.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.809
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH YOU GUYS?

12:05.860 --> 12:06.997
- OH, MY GOD, NO.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.999
- YOU NEED TO TELL ME.
YOU CAN JUST TELL ME ANYTHING.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.312
I'M DONE...

12:15.350 --> 12:16.999
HELPING HIM.

12:19.150 --> 12:22.074
- THE FACT
THAT YOUR EX-HUSBAND

12:22.120 --> 12:23.803
SLEPT HERE
AND YOU SLEPT THERE

12:23.840 --> 12:24.943
AND THERE'S CIGARETTES--

12:24.980 --> 12:27.187
EVEN AS A TRUSTING PERSON,

12:27.220 --> 12:30.360
JUST A LITTLE HARD FOR ME
NOT TO GET BUMPED BY THAT.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.784
I WOULDN'T...

12:41.380 --> 12:42.927
- SHOW ME THE PLACE.
- YEAH.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.996
THIS IS THE MAIN STUDIO.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.300

12:47.350 --> 12:49.511

12:49.560 --> 12:51.073
KIND OF IN THE AIR HERE.

12:51.110 --> 12:53.522

13:04.120 --> 13:06.054
THIS ROOM ISN'T SET YET.

13:06.090 --> 13:07.079

13:07.130 --> 13:08.529
I WANT TO RECORD IN HERE.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.808

13:14.170 --> 13:15.125

- IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.138

'CAUSE YOU KNOW
HOW HE GETS, HONEY.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.767
- I SHOULD JUST LEAVE.
- THIS IS SO EXCITING.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.118
- I SHOULD JUST GO.
- WAIT, W-WAIT.

17:35.150 --> 17:36.663
IS IT AMY?
- YEAH.

17:36.710 --> 17:39.702
- YOU'RE GONNA KISS AMY
ON THE MOUTH.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.253
- YES.
- I'M SO EXCITED.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.153
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.226
I MEAN, IS SHE INTO IT?

17:44.270 --> 17:45.885
LIKE, HAVE THERE BEEN MOMENTS
THAT YOU FEEL--

17:45.920 --> 17:47.330
- I FEEL LIKE YES.
- WOW.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.406
- BUT I CAN'T--
I MEAN, I'M NOT POSITIVE.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.543
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

17:50.580 --> 17:51.786
- HOW DO I GAUGE
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.447
- OKAY, I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THIS.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.617
- ALL RIGHT,
I APPRECIATE THIS.

17:54.650 --> 17:57.278
- SO, FIRST, YOU KNOW,
GO KIND OF, LIKE,

17:57.310 --> 17:58.652
SIT NEXT TO HER OR SOMETHING.
- UH-HUH.

17:58.690 --> 18:00.442
- AND PUT LIKE YOUR LEG
NEXT TO HER LEG.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.696
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
SO IT'S TOUCHING A LITTLE BIT.

18:01.730 --> 18:04.107
- MAN, I CAN'T...
- WHAT? YOU COME TO ME,

18:04.150 --> 18:05.902
YOU ASK ME,
I'M TELLING YOU.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.384
JUST LISTEN.

18:07.430 --> 18:09.694
SO JUST, LIKE,
IF SHE DOESN'T MOVE HER LEG,

18:09.740 --> 18:11.492
THEN SHE'S PROBABLY INTO IT,
OKAY?

18:11.530 --> 18:13.771
SO PHASE TWO IS, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SI'ITING

18:13.810 --> 18:15.254
NEXT TO HER,
AND YOU JUST KIND OF WANT

18:15.300 --> 18:17.188
TO GIVE HER A LOOK.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.676
YOU KNOW,
AND YOU JUST KIND OF KEEP

18:19.710 --> 18:22.167
HER EYE CONTACT,
AND, IF SHE DOESN'T LOOK AWAY,

18:22.200 --> 18:24.885
YOU JUST KIND OF...

18:24.930 --> 18:26.750
- NO.
I CAN'T.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.132
- COME ON.

18:28.170 --> 18:29.614
- OH, MAN.
- I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.161
IT'S A LOT EASIER
THAN IT SEEMS.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.279
HON ESTLY.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.891
I'M SURE SHE WANTS
TO KISS YOU.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.170
AND I'M SURE
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.417
- THANK YOU.

18:40.770 --> 18:41.930
- NO PROBLEM.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.288
- ALL RIGHT,
SO HOW MANY TIMES

18:43.320 --> 18:44.252
HAS HE TRIED
TO GET CLEAN?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.770
- I DON'T KNOW.
A LOT.

18:46.810 --> 18:49.802
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
- HOW? WHY?

18:49.850 --> 18:52.910
- BECAUSE EVERY OTHER TIME
HE'S TRIED TO GET SOBER,

18:52.950 --> 18:54.918
HE HAS TRIED TO DO IT
BY HIMSELF.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.292
THIS TIME, HE'S SAYING
HE WANTS HELP.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.921
HE'S GOING TO REHAB.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.269
- OH, MAN, WHY AREN'T WE
THROWING HIM A PARTY?

19:01.310 --> 19:02.265
- OKAY.

19:02.310 --> 19:03.686
- WELL, IT IS--
IT IS DIFFERENT.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.585
- SARAH, HE'S PLAYING YOU.

19:05.620 --> 19:06.962
- HE'S NOT.
- WELL, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.513
COME ON.
LET'S JUST LISTEN.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.199
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION, OKAY?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.457
HE'S MADE A DECISION
FOR HIMSELF

19:13.490 --> 19:14.764
FOR HIS FAMILY.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.279
HE'S LOOKED INTO PLACES.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.628
HE WOULD BE THERE TODAY,

19:17.670 --> 19:18.762
BUT THERE'S A WAITING LIST

19:18.810 --> 19:19.970
AT THE STATE FACILITY,

19:20.020 --> 19:21.772
AND THE PRIVATE FACILITIES
ARE EXPENSIVE,

19:21.810 --> 19:23.220
AND HE'S FIGURING THAT OUT.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.363
- HEY, HERE IT COMES.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.492
HERE IT IS.
- WHAT IS HERE?

19:25.540 --> 19:26.529
WHAT IS COMING?

19:26.570 --> 19:27.707
- HE'S WORKING YOU FOR MONEY.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.956
- HE'S NOT WORKING ME
FOR MONEY.

19:28.990 --> 19:29.957
- OH, HONEY, PLEASE.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.958
SARAH, MY GOD.

19:31.990 --> 19:33.992
YOUR LOSER EX-HUSBAND
SHOWS UP

19:34.030 --> 19:34.997
AI-TER ALL THIS TIME...
- THAT'S NICE.

19:35.030 --> 19:36.952
- AND, WHAT, HE DECIDES
HE'S GOT TO CLEAN UP

19:37.000 --> 19:39.275
HIS ACT, BUT, OH,
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.299
"I NEED SOME MONEY."

19:40.350 --> 19:42.818
SO WHERE'S HE
GONNA GET IT FROM?

19:42.870 --> 19:45.202
GO'ITA COME FROM YOU.
- HE HAS NOT ASKED ME

19:45.250 --> 19:46.319
FOR ONE PENNY.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.624
- NOT YET.
- I'M DONE WITH THIS.

19:47.660 --> 19:50.424
SO...

19:50.460 --> 19:51.836
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

19:51.880 --> 19:55.498
ACTUALLY, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU BELIEVE IN HIM OR NOT,

19:55.530 --> 19:56.701
BECAUSE I DO.

19:56.740 --> 19:59.493
I BELIEVE HE CAN CHANGE.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.679
I REALLY DO.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.479
[door shuts]

20:08.340 --> 20:11.332
- DAMN IT.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.232
- DON'T GIVE HER ANY MONEY,
CAMILLE.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.864
- I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

20:24.630 --> 20:28.760

21:22.140 --> 21:23.892
I DON'T THINK THIS WAS
SUCH A GOOD IDEA, MAN.

21:23.930 --> 21:24.965
- HEY, IT WAS THE ONLY IDEA.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.447

WE WEREN'T READY.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.867

WE HAVE TO BE READY.

21:30.910 --> 21:32.480

THAT A MONKEY CAN DO, YOU KNOW.

21:32.530 --> 21:34.691
I HAVE TO BE PRESENT.
I HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS

21:34.740 --> 21:36.560
AND BE MINDFUL,

21:36.600 --> 21:38.010
I NEED TO BE AWAKE.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.833

23:46.490 --> 23:48.833
IT'S ON FIRE,

WHAT TO TELL YOU, OKAY?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.996
MAYBE THIS IS NORMAL FOR HIM.
MAYBE IT'S NOT.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.007
I DON'T KNOW.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.132

24:48.000 --> 24:49.683
YOU CANNOT
TAKE THAT PERSONALLY.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.891
- NO.
I'M NOT TAKING IT PERSONALLY.

24:50.930 --> 24:52.238
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY TIRED.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.999
UH, THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO IT.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.907

AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE
TIME TO DO EVERYTHING

25:09.610 --> 25:10.747
WE'D LIKE TO DO.

YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

25:12.370 --> 25:15.578
- I'M GONNA GO

25:22.380 --> 25:24.655

I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED GREAT.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.032
I MEAN, IF I'M THE AUDIENCE,
THAT WAS STELLAR.

26:04.070 --> 26:05.583
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TO GO AGAIN.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.905
I MEAN, HE NAILED THAT
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

26:07.940 --> 26:09.760
BUT THEY GOT
TO HAVE ANOTHER CONFERENCE.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.074
IS THIS NORMAL FOR THEM TO--

26:11.120 --> 26:13.588
- CAN YOU STOP ASKING ME
IF EVERYTHING IS NORMAL?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.870
I NEED YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE
SO I CAN WORK, OKAY?

26:15.910 --> 26:17.150

26:18.680 --> 26:21.740
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.919
HEY.

I GOT SOME STUFF TO DO.

26:25.410 --> 26:26.957
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.785

WHO ELSE TO ASK.

26:47.980 --> 26:51.279
AND I DID LOOK INTO
THE STATE FACILITIES, YOU KNOW.

26:51.330 --> 26:53.082
- YEAH.
- AND THERE'S SUCH

26:53.120 --> 26:55.702
A LONG WAITING LIST,
AND I REALLY DO FEEL

26:55.750 --> 26:58.127
LIKE HE'S READY,
YOU KNOW.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.299
HE'S SO READY TO CHANGE.

27:00.340 --> 27:03.685
HE'S SO FULL OF HOPE,

27:03.720 --> 27:05.950
AND, I MEAN,
HE WANTS TO CHANGE, YOU KNOW.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.683
HE REALLY WANTS TO BE THERE
FOR THEM.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.132
AND WHO ELSE DOES HE HAVE,
YOU KNOW?

27:10.180 --> 27:11.727
AND, WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO WATCH HIM GO TO JAIL

27:11.760 --> 27:12.931
OR WORSE?
- NO.

27:12.970 --> 27:16.315
YEAH, NO.

27:16.350 --> 27:18.238
- I MEAN, HE'S THEIR DAD.

27:20.980 --> 27:24.734
- WE'RE GONNA--WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.669
- DON'T SAY YES
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, REALLY.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.325
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.019
- NO, IT'S IMPORTANT.

27:31.060 --> 27:33.199
IT'S IMPORTANT.
I GET IT.

27:33.230 --> 27:34.674
OF COURSE I'LL HELP.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.880
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

27:35.930 --> 27:38.922
- OF COURSE.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.245
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.339
THEY ARE CONFERRING
IN THERE

27:49.390 --> 27:52.382
AND WANTED TO DO THAT
WITHOUT ME THERE.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.002
- CROSBY,
WE CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.870
WE CAN'T LOSE IT
IN FRONT OF THE CLIENTS, OKAY?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.878
AND YOU CAN'T KICK ME
OUT OF THE CONTROL BOOTH.

27:59.910 --> 28:01.150
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S THE LEAST

28:01.190 --> 28:02.919
OF OUR WORRIES
RIGHT NOW.

28:02.950 --> 28:05.293
- WELL, MAYBE TO YOU, BUT TO ME,
IT'S OF VITAL CONCERN, OKAY?

28:05.330 --> 28:07.264
WE ARE BUSINESS PARTNERS.
WE'RE NOT JUST BROTHERS, OKAY?

28:07.300 --> 28:08.949
WE CAN'T BRING THAT--
- LOOK, YOU GOT TO BE SENSITIVE.

28:08.990 --> 28:11.049
WE ARE FAILING IN THERE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

28:11.100 --> 28:13.989
YOU NEED TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.072
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
HE HASN'T LIKED A SINGLE TAKE.

28:23.110 --> 28:24.793
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.284
YOU KNOW,
I'VE DONE THIS 100 TIMES.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.868
- MAYBE IT'S NOT YOU.
MAYBE IT'S THEM.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.769
- YOU GUYS TAKING
A LITTLE BREAK?

28:34.810 --> 28:36.425
- NO. NO.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.847
WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.

28:41.090 --> 28:41.909
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.360
- WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

28:47.440 --> 28:51.968
- WELL, I THINK
WE WERE PROBABLY JUST FIRED.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.186
- THEN WE

29:07.220 --> 29:08.562
- WHAT?

29:08.600 --> 29:11.046
- MARK.
- YEAH?

29:11.090 --> 29:14.878
- SETH'S GONNA GO
INTO REHAB, HE TOLD ME.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.911
- OKAY.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.359
UM...

29:18.410 --> 29:20.332
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

29:20.370 --> 29:21.541
THAT'S GREAT.
- YEAH.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.923
- AND GREAT
FOR YOUR KIDS TOO.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.030
- YEAH, I THINK
HE'S REALLY TRYING TO BE THERE

29:26.070 --> 29:27.799
FOR THEM.

29:27.830 --> 29:30.378
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
FOR YOU, I MEAN?

29:30.420 --> 29:34.936
IS HE TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR YOU TOO?

29:34.980 --> 29:37.835
- I'LL SEE HIM
THROUGH IT.

29:37.870 --> 29:40.282
- OKAY.

29:40.330 --> 29:44.118
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.368
- I DON'T KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU...

29:47.400 --> 29:51.882
NEED TO GET INVOLVED,
AND H MEAN,

29:51.920 --> 29:55.879
I WOULD EXPECT
NOTHING LESS OF YOU.

29:55.930 --> 29:59.058
- BUT?

29:59.100 --> 30:03.867
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.882
- GOOD MORNING.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.399
- GOOD MORNING.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.295
- WELL, WHAT'S THE WORD?
ARE WE FIRED YET?

30:27.340 --> 30:30.810
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE COMING BACK, ADAM.

30:34.210 --> 30:36.098
- THAT HOW THEY DO IT?
THEY JUST DON'T SHOW UP?

30:36.140 --> 30:37.448
IS THAT
HOW WE'RE GONNA GET FIRED?

30:37.490 --> 30:38.559
- NO, MAYBE THEY'LL CALL US

30:38.590 --> 30:40.899
OR THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST SEND
AN ASSISTANT DOWN

30:40.940 --> 30:42.168
TO GRAB ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT.

30:42.210 --> 30:46.909
I MEAN--
I MEAN, UGH.

30:46.940 --> 30:49.352
WHO KNOWS?

30:49.390 --> 30:51.904
OH, MAN.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.875
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,

30:56.920 --> 30:59.263
SO THAT'S IT THEN.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.670
- I'M SO SORRY.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.167
I FEEL LIKE I LET YOU DOWN
AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY

31:06.200 --> 31:08.441
AND THE NEW BABY.
- [mutters]

31:08.480 --> 31:11.927
WE'LL GET OTHER MUSICIANS
IN HERE TO RECORD.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.689
WE WEREN'T READY.

31:14.730 --> 31:16.652
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID?

31:16.700 --> 31:18.930
WE GAVE IT OUR ALL.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.665
AND THAT'S ALL
ANYBODY CAN DO EVER.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.453
LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.422
WE HIT A LITTLE BUMP.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.529
SO THAT WE COULD TOAST
WRAPPING UP THIS JOB.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.639
GUESS WE'RE JUST HAVING IT
A LITTLE EARLIER

31:34.680 --> 31:37.240
THAN I THOUGHT WE WOULD.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.407
TO THE LEMONADE STAND.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.613
- TO THE LUNCHEONE'ITE.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.959
- YO.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.444
GOOD MﬁRNING.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.720
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
- HOW ARE YA?

31:45.760 --> 31:47.034
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU GUYS READY

31:47.070 --> 31:48.412
TO HIT IT AGAIN?
- ANY TIME YOU WANT.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.509
WE'RE READY TO GO.
- YESTERDAY WAS KIND OF

31:50.560 --> 31:51.959
LIKE A SUCK ASS DAY, MAN.
- YEAH.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.102
[overlapping statements]

31:53.150 --> 31:54.970
- I WAS KIND OF CAUGHT UP
IN TRYING

31:55.010 --> 31:56.079
TO DO IT LIKE JANIS,

31:56.120 --> 31:57.314
AND I REALLY
WASN'T FEELING THAT.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.691
BUT I FOUND THIS OTHER APPROACH
TO IT.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.560
ERMA FRANKLIN'S VERSION.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.465
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THAT?
- YEAH, YEAH.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.422
IT'S A LITTLE MORE SOUL.
- EXACTLY.

32:04.470 --> 32:05.676
- YEAH, YEAH.
- IT'S MY THING,

32:05.710 --> 32:07.189
SO WE'LL TRY THAT TODAY.

32:07.230 --> 32:08.458
- THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT, COOL,

32:08.510 --> 32:09.534
SO I'LL SEE Y'ALL IN THERE.
- YEAH.

32:09.580 --> 32:10.717
- ALL RIGHT. COOL.
- PEACE.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.923
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, GENTLEMEN.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.963
OH, MAN. LISTEN TO ME.
- YEAH.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.481
- DON'T WORRY
ABOUT MY FAMILY HERE EVER, OKAY?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.727
WE ARE BUSINESS PARTNERS HERE.
THAT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.651
YOU JUST GOT TO GO IN THERE
AND MAKE GREAT MUSIC.

32:27.700 --> 32:28.769
- OKAY.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.620
- ALL RIGHT.
KICK ASS.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.459
- YEAH, HOLD ON.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.489
HEY, ADAM.
- YEAH.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.462
- I NEED YOU, MAN.

32:48.690 --> 32:50.999
- [grumbles]
- OH.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.338
- NO WAY.
SHE'S REALLY OUT, RIGHT?

32:52.380 --> 32:54.132
- SHE IS KNOCKED OUT.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.205
- HEY.
- HI.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.105
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE
- SHE'S ASLEEP.

32:57.140 --> 33:00.200
- I GOT TO PROPOSE A TOAST HERE
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.797
- GET READY.
- KRISTINA AND NORA.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.001
OKAY, THEY'RE NOT HERE.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.520
AND TO ADAM AND CROSBY
AND THEIR NEW BUSINESS VENTURE.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.288
- CHEERS.

33:09.330 --> 33:10.706
- AND TO THE REST OF 'EM.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.775
THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT THEY'RE IRRELEVANT.

33:11.810 --> 33:14.085
[laughter]

33:14.130 --> 33:15.609
- THANK YOU FOR DINNER
IN ADVANCE.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.709
- YOU'RE WELCOME. OH.
- I DIDN'T KNOW

33:16.750 --> 33:18.297
ABOUT THE ABSENT PEOPLE TOAST.

33:18.340 --> 33:20.547
- YEAH.
THAT'S A WHOLE SIDE OF HIM...

33:20.580 --> 33:23.378
- SO SYDNEY WAS REALLY,
REALLY WIPED OUT.

33:23.410 --> 33:24.445
- I'M SO HUNGRY.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.789
- BY THE WAY...
- IT'S SOl-TBALL.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.752
- SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE THING,

33:28.790 --> 33:31.099
AND WE ARE HAPPY,
MORE THAN HAPPY,

33:31.140 --> 33:33.768
TO HELP OUT.
- OH. YEAH.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.767
YEAH, YEAH.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.520
- ANYWAY, WE'RE...

33:38.560 --> 33:40.289

33:40.320 --> 33:41.526
- WHAT?

33:41.570 --> 33:43.117
- NOTHING, MOM.
NOTHING.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.321
- IT'S A SECRET.
IS IT A SECRET?

33:44.360 --> 33:45.395
- SEEMS LIKE IT.

33:45.430 --> 33:46.806
- COME ON.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.294
OH, THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.843
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- THIS IS JUNIOR HIGH.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.051
- NO, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

33:51.090 --> 33:52.603
WHAT'S UP?

33:52.650 --> 33:53.605
- I'M SORRY.

33:53.650 --> 33:54.742
- MOM AND DAD,

33:54.790 --> 33:56.360
JOEL AND JULIA
ARE GIVING ME MONEY

33:56.410 --> 33:58.401
TO PUT SETH IN REHAB.

34:02.730 --> 34:05.449
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

34:05.490 --> 34:07.481
- NO.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.215
- WHY?
I MEAN...WAIT A MINUTE.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.810
- DAD, THIS IS
HOW I'M HANDLING IT.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.728
- WHAT THE HELL
DID HE EVER DO FOR YOU?

34:17.770 --> 34:21.183
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

34:21.230 --> 34:23.778
I MEAN, Al-TER WE TALKED, SARAH.
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE--

34:23.820 --> 34:25.082
HE DIDN'T ASK YOU
FOR MONEY?

34:25.130 --> 34:26.574
JULIA, YOU CAN'T GIVE
THIS GUY MONEY.

34:26.610 --> 34:28.749
- ZEEK.

34:28.790 --> 34:31.748
THAT'S ENOUGH.

34:33.790 --> 34:36.714
I RESPECT THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.797
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I DO.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.242
BUT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT
THE DECISION

34:42.280 --> 34:45.408
THAT MY SISTER-IN-LAW MADE HERE.

34:45.460 --> 34:49.669
YOU RAISED
TWO SMART, WONDERFUL GIRLS.

34:49.700 --> 34:53.807
AND THIS ONE, I MEAN,
SHE'S OPENED HER HEART HERE.

34:53.850 --> 34:57.843
AND ANYTIME YOU DO THAT,
IT'S THE RIGHT CHOICE.

34:57.880 --> 35:03.853
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, EVEN IF
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT,

35:03.890 --> 35:07.849
WE'RE GONNA GIVE MONEY
TO WHOEVER WE WANT.

35:07.890 --> 35:13.544
AND WE'RE GONNA ADOPT
FROM WHOMEVER WE WANT

35:13.590 --> 35:15.410
HOWEVER WE WANT.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.832
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BE OKAY WITH THAT.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.734
- YOU'RE OUT
ON THE STREET

35:28.780 --> 35:30.532
LOOKING GOOD

35:30.570 --> 35:32.538
LOOKING REAL GOOD, BABY

35:32.570 --> 35:34.845
AND YOU KNOW DEEP DOWN
IN YOUR HEART

35:34.890 --> 35:36.676
THAT IT AIN'T RIGHT

35:36.720 --> 35:38.859
OH, YOU AIN'T RIGHT,
DARLING

35:38.890 --> 35:40.858
BUT YOU NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER HEAR ME

35:40.890 --> 35:42.858
WHEN I CRY AT NIGHT

35:42.890 --> 35:43.857
OOH

35:45.210 --> 35:46.928
I TELL MYSELF

35:46.970 --> 35:50.690
THAT I CAN NO LONGER STAND
THE PAIN

35:50.730 --> 35:53.767
BUT WHEN YOU HOLD ME
IN YOUR ARMS

35:53.800 --> 35:57.213
I SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN

40:15.750 --> 40:17.786

40:24.040 --> 40:25.723
- I MEAN, WE MAY AS WELL,
RIGHT?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.625
JUST FOR THE COLOR.

40:37.780 --> 40:39.839
A BOWL OF FRESH STRAWBERRIES.

40:44.890 --> 40:48.747

40:48.790 --> 40:52.612
I WON'T SHED A TEAR

40:52.650 --> 40:56.541

I'LL KEEP YOU WARM

41:04.280 --> 41:06.214
TILL THE SUN GIVES IN

41:06.250 --> 41:07.524

SHE CAN'T GET ME IN TROUBLE.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.800
I DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.182
I MEAN,
I AM NERVOUS, THOUGH.

41:10.220 --> 41:11.528
WHAT DID YOU DO, YOU PERV?
- NOTHING.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.832

41:12.880 --> 41:17.089

TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.190

41:19.230 --> 41:21.084
- DID YOU GET A KISS?
- TO SAY THE LEAST. YEAH.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.882
- MY LI'ITLE BROTHER
GOT A BIG KISS.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.616
- MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLED
THE MEETING FOR.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.269
DAD.

41:28.310 --> 41:30.858
- HI, SON.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.208
[sighs]

41:32.240 --> 41:36.586
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

41:41.740 --> 41:44.629
BUT YOUR MOM'S HELPED ME COME
TO AN IMPORTANT DECISION

41:44.670 --> 41:46.114
IN MY LIFE,

41:46.150 --> 41:49.039
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU
ABOUT IT.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.775
I'M GONNA GO TO REHAB,

41:51.810 --> 41:55.576
AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG, HARD ROAD.

41:56.850 --> 41:59.569
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

41:59.620 --> 42:03.898
BUT I'M GONNA DO IT.

42:03.930 --> 42:09.209
AND I NEED YOUR SUPPORT.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.696
AND WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.211
AS A FAMILY.

42:16.250 --> 42:21.597

42:22.670 --> 42:25.776
THE RISING TIDE
