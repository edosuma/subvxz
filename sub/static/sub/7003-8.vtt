00:04.503 --> 00:08.006
Good night, al.
Good night, heidi.

00:09.008 --> 00:12.543
Good show tonight, al.
You think so?

00:12.544 --> 00:14.980
You insulted me 17 times.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.616
You're right.
Great show!

00:17.617 --> 00:19.584
Tim. Al.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.620
Hi, heidi.
Hi.

00:21.621 --> 00:24.856
Super episode.
Right up there with vila.

00:24.857 --> 00:29.628
Thanks, wes.
Thank you,
president davidson.

00:29.629 --> 00:33.632
He's president of binford tools,
not the United States, al.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.133
So how are my friends
at <i>tool time?</i>

00:35.134 --> 00:39.270
Beats me. I don't think
you have any.

00:39.271 --> 00:42.841
You know, tim, you're as funny
now as when we first started
selling tools.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.442
I remember that.

00:44.443 --> 00:48.880
You know, wes here was binford's
best number-two tool salesman.

00:48.881 --> 00:52.684
Boy, I can't remember the guy's
name that was number one. Who
was the number-one salesman?

00:52.685 --> 00:54.653
It was you, tim.
Was it me?

00:54.654 --> 00:57.088
But we all know who's
number one now, don't we?

00:57.089 --> 00:59.323
Yes, we do,
mr. President.

00:59.324 --> 01:02.727
Al, I really enjoyed
the "what's new" segment,

01:02.728 --> 01:05.030
And it started my little
gray cells churning.

01:05.031 --> 01:07.365
Mm-hm?
Seems like it churned the hair
right off your head.

01:07.366 --> 01:09.333
Hey! Hey.

01:09.334 --> 01:12.070
The hair's off-limits,
taylor.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.673
It's off your scalp, too.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.374
Anyway...

01:16.375 --> 01:20.111
We just finished the prototype
for a new reciprocating saw.

01:20.112 --> 01:22.113
I didn't know we were
developing one.
You didn't know I'd be

01:22.114 --> 01:27.351
Your boss one day either.
Gentlemen, the binford 6100,

01:27.352 --> 01:30.254
With state-of-the-art
electronic feedback control.

01:30.255 --> 01:32.791
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, I love
that in a saw!
Boy.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.426
Look how thin she is.
And she's light.

01:35.427 --> 01:39.064
And look at this,
there's a pistol grip.
Down, boy!

01:39.065 --> 01:43.201
I thought it would be perfect
if you could give it a sneak
preview on Friday's segment.

01:43.202 --> 01:45.036
That's a very good idea.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.172
We can see now why
you're number one.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.708
Thanks, al.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.976
Well, back to work.

01:51.977 --> 01:54.212
Bye, al.
See you, timmy.

01:54.213 --> 01:59.283
So long, wessy.
See you, mr. President.

01:59.284 --> 02:02.887
Why don't you just glue
your lips to his butt?

02:09.695 --> 02:12.363
There's no need
to be snitty.

02:12.364 --> 02:14.966
Besides, I think you're
overlooking something very
important

02:14.967 --> 02:17.635
That has just happened here.

02:17.636 --> 02:21.405
<i>(both)</i> we got a new tool!

03:38.483 --> 03:41.886
There's nothing to eat
in this house.

03:41.887 --> 03:44.522
Hey, randy.
What's in the pantry?

03:44.523 --> 03:49.593
We got some garlic powder,
nutmeg and fennel.

03:49.594 --> 03:51.996
What's fennel?

03:51.997 --> 03:55.233
That's what al's shirts
are made of.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.769
Hey, guys, are you here?
<i>(brad)</i> yeah.

03:58.770 --> 04:02.673
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
What a day!

04:02.674 --> 04:04.642
The computers all went
down at work,

04:04.643 --> 04:07.645
And then I had a library
fundraiser meeting, and I got
this headache -

04:07.646 --> 04:11.082
I thought my head
was going to explode.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.852
Mom, we're completely
out of food.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.954
Thank you for caring.

04:16.956 --> 04:20.124
You father and I just went to
the grocery store two days ago.
How can there be no food?

04:20.125 --> 04:23.328
There's no food!

04:23.329 --> 04:28.299
Gosh! You guys are just like
piranhas in blue jeans.

04:28.300 --> 04:33.104
Ok, I'll order a pizza for
tonight. Tomorrow I'll go
to the grocery store.

04:33.105 --> 04:36.407
Can you make sure the food
is here by the time we get home
from school?

04:36.408 --> 04:38.609
Why don't I just meet you
at the bus stop?

04:38.610 --> 04:41.712
I can serve you
as you get off.

04:41.713 --> 04:44.615
You're always
thinking, mom.

04:44.616 --> 04:47.852
Here's what I'm thinking:

04:47.853 --> 04:50.088
Tomorrow I'm gonna give
you boys some money.

04:50.089 --> 04:54.192
Yeah! Money!
I'm gonna send you
to the grocery store.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.594
You're gonna buy everything I
tell you to - nothing else.

04:56.595 --> 04:58.363
Oh, man!

04:58.364 --> 05:01.099
And when I say potatoes
I don't mean potato chips.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.568
And milk does not mean
milk duds, ok?

05:04.569 --> 05:07.471
Can we at least
get something sweet?

05:07.472 --> 05:11.242
You could buy me some flowers -
that'd be sweet.

05:11.243 --> 05:13.844
Hi, everybody.
Oh, hi.

05:13.845 --> 05:17.348
How is the best gosh-darn family
in the whole world?

05:17.349 --> 05:21.152
You got a new tool,
didn't you?
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah!

05:21.153 --> 05:23.687
Binford's coming out with
a new saw.

05:23.688 --> 05:26.690
I get to promote it on the show.
Tonight I get to try it out in
the garage -

05:26.691 --> 05:28.626
If you'll help move
the hot rod chassis out.

05:28.627 --> 05:30.795
Is it a power saw?
You bet.

05:30.796 --> 05:33.965
I'll get the candles.
I'll get the band-aids.

05:43.542 --> 05:46.644
Honey, are you still here?
It's two in the morning.

05:46.645 --> 05:49.280
Come over here, jill.
Look at this.

05:49.281 --> 05:51.816
Know what I found out
when I took this apart?

05:51.817 --> 05:55.853
That you couldn't put it
back together?

05:55.854 --> 05:58.256
This is an inferior tool.

05:58.257 --> 06:02.327
I'm embarrassed to have it in
the garage breathing the same
air as the rest of my stuff.

06:02.328 --> 06:07.031
Honey, I know they're
like little people to you,
but get a grip.

06:07.032 --> 06:10.134
No, no, no.
Look at these washers.

06:10.135 --> 06:13.904
These are plastic washers,
plastic screws.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.274
I knew this'd happen
when davidson took over.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.742
He doesn't care about quality
the way I do.

06:18.743 --> 06:22.780
No kidding. I saw his wife
at a christmas party.

06:25.884 --> 06:29.420
Binford would have never
made a tool like this.

06:29.421 --> 06:32.556
The length of the stroke
isn't even half an inch.

06:32.557 --> 06:37.761
Well, that may be obvious
to you and me, but...

06:37.762 --> 06:41.499
Davidson may not know
that this is a bad tool.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.302
How could he not know
this is a bad tool?

06:44.303 --> 06:47.872
He's been sitting behind
a desk for ten years.

06:47.873 --> 06:51.809
You're right. Even when we were
selling tools together -

06:51.810 --> 06:55.779
- Get this, he didn't know
the difference between
a spline shank and a two-flute.

06:57.782 --> 07:00.584
That was exactly
my reaction.

07:00.585 --> 07:03.354
Honey, if you tell him
that this is a bad tool,

07:03.355 --> 07:05.223
He may not want you
to promote it.

07:05.224 --> 07:07.791
You think so?
Yeah. You should go
talk to him.

07:07.792 --> 07:10.895
Maybe you're right.
I'm always right.

07:10.896 --> 07:14.899
Why is that?
'cause I'm so smart.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.436
If you're so smart,
mrs. Magna cum lately,

07:18.437 --> 07:21.506
Why don't you help me
put it back together.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.408
Absolutely not.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.177
See, I'm getting smarter
all the time.

07:27.179 --> 07:30.548
Well, here we are.
Have a seat.

07:30.549 --> 07:32.850
Mr. Davidson will be
with you shortly.

07:32.851 --> 07:34.618
Thanks, laura.

07:34.619 --> 07:38.222
Oh, by the way, al, all of us
here at binford love you.

07:38.223 --> 07:41.792
I bet we both have
a lot of fans around here.

07:41.793 --> 07:45.896
Well, like I said,
mr. Davidson will be
with you shortly.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.739
Why did we have to come here?

07:55.740 --> 07:58.409
You know I'm not good at
confronting superiors.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.278
Al, you got to speak up.

08:00.279 --> 08:04.415
If a kiss-up like you has
a complaint, he'll take it
seriously.

08:04.416 --> 08:08.786
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Hello, mr. President.

08:11.190 --> 08:15.093
Comfortable, tim?
How can I not be?
It's so homey in here.

08:17.896 --> 08:20.965
How are you guys?
You want anything?

08:20.966 --> 08:23.468
We want you to scrap
production on the 6100.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.406
I was thinking more along
the lines of coffee or tea.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.476
It's an inferior tool.
Both al and I agree.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.479
Is this true, al?

08:42.654 --> 08:46.357
I would like some tea.

08:46.358 --> 08:49.026
The point is I took it
home last night

08:49.027 --> 08:50.928
And fiddled around with it.
Al tried it this morning.

08:50.929 --> 08:52.763
The motor's really
too small, wes.

08:52.764 --> 08:56.534
There's all those
plastic parts in it.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.504
Do you have chamomile?

08:59.505 --> 09:01.805
The whole thing is cheesy
and lightweight.

09:01.806 --> 09:05.643
We feel that the lighter weight
parts make it easier to use.

09:05.644 --> 09:08.613
Particularly for the ladies.
The ladies?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.214
My wife was just remarking
the other night,

09:10.215 --> 09:12.617
"when are they gonna make
a reciprocating saw for me?

09:12.618 --> 09:15.453
"something small you can put in
a cocktail purse. Or maybe hang
it like a pendant.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.655
Maybe some drop earrings
out of it."

09:17.656 --> 09:21.292
With all due respect,
mr. President,
I... I did try it.

09:21.293 --> 09:25.796
And I felt that it wasn't
up to binford's usually
high standards.

09:25.797 --> 09:30.401
Al, it's a perfectly fine tool.
We just found some new,

09:30.402 --> 09:32.770
Innovative
manufacturing techniques.

09:32.771 --> 09:36.607
Don't you mean you found
a cheaper way to make it, wes?

09:36.608 --> 09:38.676
All right, forget
all this stuff, ok?

09:38.677 --> 09:42.112
The basic design is there.
With modifications, we got
a great tool.

09:42.113 --> 09:43.781
All you need is
a heavier casing,

09:43.782 --> 09:45.650
Go from plastic to
metal washers...

09:45.651 --> 09:48.919
Guys! I'm happy with
the saw as is.

09:48.920 --> 09:54.858
Fine. Let's just see how happy
you are when we will not promote
it on <i>tool time.</i>

09:56.261 --> 09:58.128
Tim, it's very simple.

09:58.129 --> 09:59.763
<i>(hits hole in one)</i>

09:59.764 --> 10:04.435
Binford makes tools.
Binford makes <i>tool time.</i>

10:04.436 --> 10:07.438
Your point?
If the show won't promote
our products,

10:07.439 --> 10:11.975
We have no reason continue it.
At least, not with you.

10:11.976 --> 10:14.845
Don't threaten me, wes.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.351
Al?

10:23.922 --> 10:27.325
You can cancel my tea... Sir.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.797
Mom, we're back!
We got everything on the list.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.099
<i>(jill)</i> everything?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.167
Everything except
the garlic gloves.

10:37.168 --> 10:39.337
Garlic gloves?

10:39.338 --> 10:42.607
That's garlic cloves,
honey.

10:42.608 --> 10:46.910
Oh. Then we had mark smelling
gloves for nothing.

10:47.912 --> 10:50.881
Uh-oh!
What is all this stuff?

10:50.882 --> 10:54.084
There's licorice here, potato
chips, chocolate-covered
peanuts.

10:54.085 --> 10:55.753
These things were not
on the list.

10:55.754 --> 10:58.789
We bought it with the money
we had left over.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.726
You shouldn't have had
any money left over.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.995
We're smart shoppers.
Yeah.

11:04.996 --> 11:07.798
This fruit is bruised.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.933
The crackers are smushed.

11:09.934 --> 11:12.637
What's with this can of
spaghetti sauce?

11:12.638 --> 11:15.973
Mom, it was half the price
'cause it was dented.

11:15.974 --> 11:19.243
Great. We can have
spaghetti al dente.

11:19.244 --> 11:21.312
That's a good idea.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.281
Did you buy anything
that wasn't damaged?

11:23.282 --> 11:27.451
Yeah, the chicken. We couldn't
find any dented ones.

11:27.452 --> 11:31.054
Why didn't you just throw it
up against the wall before you
got to the register?

11:31.055 --> 11:34.825
See, randy?
I told you we should do that.

11:34.826 --> 11:38.663
Well, thanks for trying.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.531
Hi, everybody.

11:40.532 --> 11:42.600
Back from shopping.
How'd it go?

11:45.304 --> 11:49.006
There's no labels on these.

11:49.007 --> 11:52.810
What is it? It could be
succotash or dog food.

11:52.811 --> 11:56.747
With the way mom cooks,
I don't think it makes
a difference.

11:56.748 --> 11:59.717
<i>(jill)</i> I heard that!

12:02.421 --> 12:04.722
So how'd it go
with davidson?
Huh!

12:04.723 --> 12:08.492
You know what they say, honey.
A weasel is a weasel...

12:08.493 --> 12:10.795
...Is a weasel!

12:10.796 --> 12:12.663
That good, huh?

12:12.664 --> 12:16.934
I guess the bottom line is,
I either promote the tool
or he fires me.

12:16.935 --> 12:18.268
What?

12:18.269 --> 12:20.638
I don't think he can hurt
"the tool man" tim taylor.

12:20.639 --> 12:24.074
He's the president of
the company. He has
the power to fire you.

12:24.075 --> 12:26.777
Who's he gonna replace me with?
Borland?

12:26.778 --> 12:32.282
Al's show now? <i>Flannel</i> <i>time?</i>
Who's gonna watch that?

12:32.283 --> 12:34.652
Ok, tell me about this tool.
Does it work?

12:34.653 --> 12:37.621
It works.

12:37.622 --> 12:39.156
Is it unsafe?

12:39.157 --> 12:41.325
No, it's not unsafe,
but this isn't the point.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.561
Is this really
about the tool?

12:43.562 --> 12:45.429
Or is it about your
problem with davidson?

12:45.430 --> 12:47.765
I don't have a problem
with davidson.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.467
You think he's a weasel.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.602
I don't have a problem
with that.

12:51.603 --> 12:56.173
Ok, if it's not about davidson
and the tool is safe.

12:56.174 --> 12:59.243
Are you really willing
to lose your job over this?

12:59.244 --> 13:03.280
Binford has always stood
for quality tools.

13:03.281 --> 13:05.383
This is a bad
reciprocating saw.

13:05.384 --> 13:08.652
What's next? A rubber miter box?
Styrofoam nails?

13:08.653 --> 13:11.655
Is there no way you can
compromise?
Jill...

13:11.656 --> 13:14.958
A lot of guys watch
the show and buy tools because
I recommend them on the show.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.994
It's a responsibility
I don't take lightly.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.932
All right.
"all right" what?

13:21.933 --> 13:25.636
All right, I'm behind you -
whatever you decide to do.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.672
Even if I lose my job
and I've gotta go back
on selling tools on the road?

13:28.673 --> 13:31.776
I won't see you,
but I'll be behind you.

13:31.777 --> 13:34.278
That's why I love you.

13:36.748 --> 13:39.082
And you don't think
I'm crazy?

13:39.083 --> 13:41.886
That's a separate issue.

13:48.226 --> 13:51.762
Hey, dad, remember the landing
gear you fixed on my plane
yesterday?

13:51.763 --> 13:53.196
Did a good job,
didn't I?

13:53.197 --> 13:55.433
I guess the glue
didn't work.

13:55.434 --> 14:00.103
Oh. I can't figure that out
my thumb was stuck to the work
bench for three hours.

14:01.506 --> 14:03.874
Well, I'll fix it again.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.546
You like me being tim "the tool
man" taylor, don't you?

14:08.547 --> 14:10.213
Yeah!

14:10.214 --> 14:12.215
You know, I also used to be
a tool salesman.

14:12.216 --> 14:14.251
I was the best salesman
binford ever had.

14:14.252 --> 14:16.520
I know.
How do you know?

14:16.521 --> 14:18.722
You told me a million times.

14:18.723 --> 14:22.626
I didn't tell you about
being on the road, though.
Staying in hotels -

14:22.627 --> 14:24.995
You get to make a big mess and
someone else cleans up after
you.

14:24.996 --> 14:26.997
Doesn't mom do that?

14:26.998 --> 14:31.669
Yeah, but the chambermaid
doesn't give you those
nasty looks.

14:31.670 --> 14:36.640
You get to eat all the food you
want - get bloated and all gassy
at night.

14:36.641 --> 14:38.375
That doesn't sound
so good.

14:38.376 --> 14:42.012
Oh, but rental cars. You can do
whatever you want to 'em.

14:42.013 --> 14:43.881
Commuter flights.
<i>(imitates plane sputtering)</i>

14:43.882 --> 14:47.551
"is that wing supposed
to be doing that?"
<i>(imitates plane nose-diving)</i>

14:47.552 --> 14:50.788
Oh, boy. Staying up late.
Talking to your kids by phone.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.691
Never being home for holidays.
I hated doing that.

14:53.692 --> 14:57.728
Dad, if you were a tool
salesman, you'd never be
home with us.

14:57.729 --> 15:00.430
I wanna be home with you guys.
I wanna do <i>tool time.</i>

15:00.431 --> 15:02.332
That's really the life I like.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.201
Here you go.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.455
It stinks, wilson.

15:25.456 --> 15:31.094
Well, tim, you can't expect
a compost heap to smell like
fine perfume.

15:31.095 --> 15:35.265
No, I'm referring to
the situation with
that weasel davidson.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.768
It's a lose-lose situation.

15:37.769 --> 15:42.172
I either promote a tool
that I don't believe in,
or I risk losing my job?!

15:42.173 --> 15:46.376
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm!
That is quite a pickle.

15:46.377 --> 15:49.146
You're right, wilson.
It's a real predicament.

15:49.147 --> 15:53.551
No, I was referring to the big
dill between the coffee grounds
and the eggshells.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.420
Wilson, could we?

15:56.421 --> 15:58.822
Oh, I'm sorry, tim.

15:58.823 --> 16:04.161
You know, it was robert
ingersoll, a 19th-century
lawyer, who said:

16:04.162 --> 16:07.731
"it is a blessed thing
that in every age

16:07.732 --> 16:11.068
Somebody has had the courage
to stand by their convictions."

16:11.069 --> 16:14.471
A lawyer said that?!

16:17.075 --> 16:21.579
On the other hand, I'm reminded
of a general named pyrrhus.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.013
That's right.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.849
It was a greek general
who fought the romans.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.719
His army won the war,
but he lost so many men,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.789
It might just as well
have been a defeat.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.357
Today we call that
a pyrrhic victory.

16:34.358 --> 16:37.995
What are you saying? That this
might not be worth the fight?

16:37.996 --> 16:41.765
It wasn't for pyrrhus.
It may be for you.

16:41.766 --> 16:46.470
You see, tim, when it's
a question of integrity,
there are no easy answers.

16:46.471 --> 16:50.774
I could come back.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.477
You're right, wilson.
This is really a pickle.

16:53.478 --> 16:56.580
And I don't mean that dill.

17:10.095 --> 17:14.064
So? What are you gonna do
about the reciprocating saw?

17:14.065 --> 17:17.467
I'm gonna do my job, al.

17:17.468 --> 17:19.269
You're not gonna promote it
on the show, are you?

17:19.270 --> 17:21.105
What about your principles?

17:21.106 --> 17:26.644
I don't wanna end up in
a pyrex victory, all right?

17:26.645 --> 17:28.310
What?

17:28.311 --> 17:32.883
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

17:32.884 --> 17:37.554
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present
tim "the tool man" taylor!

17:40.625 --> 17:42.192
Thank you.

17:42.193 --> 17:46.797
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

17:46.798 --> 17:50.067
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,
and you all know my assistant
al borland.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.707
Today we finish up "what's new"
this week on <i>tool time.</i>

17:56.708 --> 17:59.176
Got a little surprise. How would
you guys all like to see

17:59.177 --> 18:01.945
A top-secret prototype of
a new tool from binford?

18:01.946 --> 18:03.147
Yeah!

18:05.050 --> 18:09.753
Well, prepare your eyes,
cover 'em if you're a child,
'cause here we go.

18:09.754 --> 18:11.188
<i>(audience)</i> whoa!

18:11.189 --> 18:12.790
"whoa" is right.
Look at this.

18:12.791 --> 18:17.527
The new binford 6100
reciprocating saw.

18:17.528 --> 18:20.230
<i>(audience gasps)</i>
phew!

18:20.231 --> 18:24.601
Huh? Every tool binford makes
goes through a rigorous
quality-control system

18:24.602 --> 18:26.737
To make sure it's
top of the line.

18:26.738 --> 18:29.639
And the binford 6100...

18:32.510 --> 18:35.779
...Bombed out big-time.

18:37.315 --> 18:40.350
Al, if you wanna walk away,
I'll understand.

18:40.351 --> 18:43.754
I never walk away
from a tool in need.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.156
That's right.

18:46.157 --> 18:51.895
The binford 6100 bombed out
of every single test we threw
at her.

18:51.896 --> 18:56.233
And... And I bet you're
wondering who's responsible
for making a tool like this.

18:56.234 --> 19:00.670
It's the new president of
binford tools, wes davidson.
He's right over there.

19:00.671 --> 19:03.406
A man who doesn't mind
a bad tool.

19:03.407 --> 19:07.444
As long as it's made
by somebody else.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.882
'cause if it says binford on it,
it's gotta be the best.

19:11.883 --> 19:14.818
I think wes davidson deserves
a big round of applause. Wes.

19:14.819 --> 19:16.153
Come on over here, wes.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.589
Come on!

19:21.726 --> 19:24.128
It's because of this man

19:24.129 --> 19:27.197
You'll only see quality products
in your hardware store.

19:27.198 --> 19:30.667
Wes, tell us a little bit
about the problem you had
developing the 6100.

19:30.668 --> 19:33.971
Please, tell us.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.538
I'd be glad to, guys.

19:35.539 --> 19:39.777
We found that the motor
was a little underpowered.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.545
And the casing?

19:42.546 --> 19:47.317
And the casing would have been
a little stronger had we used
metal.

19:47.318 --> 19:51.155
Hm. What are you
gonna do with it?

19:51.156 --> 19:55.592
Well, in the interests of
the consumer, I've decided
to hold off production.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.327
<i>(dramatic gasp)</i>

19:59.664 --> 20:02.666
Isn't this the kind of guy
you want selling you tools?

20:02.667 --> 20:03.801
<i>(audience)</i> yeah!

20:06.037 --> 20:10.407
Uh, I got an idea.
Heidi, would you bring out
the binford big boy zx?

20:10.408 --> 20:11.641
Sure, tim.

20:13.511 --> 20:17.181
Here on <i>tool</i> <i>time,</i> when we
have a tool or product

20:17.182 --> 20:19.149
That doesn't measure up
to our standards,

20:19.150 --> 20:22.552
We give it an... Ooh!
...Interesting farewell.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.821
Heidi?

20:30.895 --> 20:32.996
The binford tool masher.

20:32.997 --> 20:35.565
Al, you wanna take
the honors here?

20:35.566 --> 20:39.536
I don't think so, tim.

20:39.537 --> 20:42.339
But perhaps wes
would like to.

20:42.340 --> 20:46.009
How about it,
mr. President?

20:46.010 --> 20:48.846
All right!
Just shove it right in there.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.480
Watch your hands!

20:53.351 --> 20:57.287
<i>(machine whirring and clunking)</i>

21:05.396 --> 21:08.565
And what we end up with...

21:08.566 --> 21:11.335
Is the new binford 6100...

21:11.336 --> 21:13.603
...Paperweight.

21:20.411 --> 21:25.582
<i>("tool time" theme tune on tv)</i>

21:25.583 --> 21:27.817
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

21:27.818 --> 21:31.922
It took a lot of integrity
to stand up to davidson
like that.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.324
Well, I'd like to say
it was no big deal.

21:34.325 --> 21:37.694
No, it was a big deal.

21:37.695 --> 21:40.163
However, if you had lost
your job,

21:40.164 --> 21:41.464
It wouldn't have been
the worst thing.

21:41.465 --> 21:44.234
What do you mean? I'd have to
go back to selling tools

21:44.235 --> 21:46.436
And be on the road
for 30 weeks.

21:46.437 --> 21:50.473
And the downside would be?

21:50.474 --> 21:53.010
You'd miss me.

21:53.011 --> 21:56.313
Until jake the pool boy
dropped by.

21:58.049 --> 22:02.685
We don't have a pool.
We'd get one.

22:02.686 --> 22:05.855
Maybe I'll just stay home.
That'd be ok, too.

22:05.856 --> 22:09.559
Since I'd be the major
breadwinner, you'd have
to stay home

22:09.560 --> 22:11.128
And do the laundry
and the cooking

22:11.129 --> 22:13.696
And the shopping, cleaning...

22:13.697 --> 22:15.966
30 weeks isn't that long.

22:15.967 --> 22:19.736
I'd have two
very interesting options.

22:19.737 --> 22:22.639
On the one hand,
you would stay home
and do the laundry.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.543
And on the other hand,
I would get the pool guy.

22:30.548 --> 22:32.482
Oh, honey!

22:32.483 --> 22:35.852
I'd never trade you
for anybody.

22:39.290 --> 22:42.926
Unless I could get a pool boy
who did the laundry.

22:47.732 --> 22:49.566
