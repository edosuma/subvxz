WEBVTT

00:00.689 --> 00:02.621
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:02.641 --> 00:03.701
You trying to bribe the judge?

00:04.617 --> 00:05.661
No.

00:05.681 --> 00:09.665
I think I need an estimate
of how long you're gonna hate me.

00:09.681 --> 00:11.641
I don't know.

00:11.657 --> 00:13.625
Can I help you fellas?

00:13.645 --> 00:16.645
That guy in the shop,
he's my father.

00:16.665 --> 00:18.705
You were too young to be tied down
to a wife and kids.

00:19.621 --> 00:20.657
Is that why you left?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.990
In pas de deux, there are
trust exercises they make us do,

00:27.006 --> 00:28.977
which is a bit sad,

00:28.997 --> 00:33.027
because if trust was a given,
then you wouldn't need exercises.

00:33.043 --> 00:35.970
Please, Abigail. Come on.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.004
You'd believe
someone when they say it.

00:38.025 --> 00:42.974
Must you whine like that?
There's plenty of hot water left.

00:46.057 --> 00:47.988
Abigail!

00:48.007 --> 00:51.038
And be able to
tell the truth in every situation.

00:51.054 --> 00:53.969
Have you told your friends about us?

00:53.985 --> 00:55.036
I didn't think it was a secret.

00:55.053 --> 00:59.030
No, it isn't... anymore.

01:05.044 --> 01:06.975
In pas de deux,

01:06.994 --> 01:09.006
it's usually fear that stops you
from trusting your partner...

01:10.981 --> 01:12.037
unless they've dropped you before.

01:14.011 --> 01:15.015
Hi.

01:15.030 --> 01:17.993
Then it's learning from experience.

01:18.013 --> 01:20.948
Ah.
What's your schedule like today?

01:20.968 --> 01:24.990
Uh, first up, inappropriate PDA -
tick.

01:27.033 --> 01:31.971
And then avoid being run over
by a dude who can't read

01:31.986 --> 01:33.034
'pedestrians only'.

01:36.940 --> 01:39.995
Hey. It's not a bad place
if you live in the city.

01:40.011 --> 01:41.942
What are you doing here?

01:41.962 --> 01:45.940
I thought... Didn't I text you?
No.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.010
Oh. Well, I thought
I'd take some time off...

01:49.031 --> 01:52.937
I'm gonna take a wild stab.
You're Christian's...

01:52.956 --> 01:55.015
This is Raf.
Oh, right. Well, I'm Kat.

01:55.935 --> 01:58.930
It's nice to meet you.
You too.

01:58.949 --> 02:00.997
I should probably find a car park
or something.

02:01.016 --> 02:03.935
There is one down there.
We can show you if you like.

02:03.956 --> 02:06.977
Ah, no, we've got to get to class.
We're running a bit late, so...

02:06.998 --> 02:09.925
Well, we should catch up later,
if that's alright.

02:09.940 --> 02:10.976
Yeah, sure.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.982 --> 02:25.925
I'm sure it was his Dad,

02:25.944 --> 02:29.987
and Kat was there introducing herself
in, like, a girlfriend capacity.

02:30.002 --> 02:31.982
And I was fine about it.

02:32.001 --> 02:34.984
Congratulations, Chicken.
We have closure.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.931
Exactly.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.919
I miss Kat and I think she misses me,

02:38.938 --> 02:40.978
so now things can go back to
the way they were.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.953
Christian, you are killing me.

02:42.972 --> 02:44.959
That is a fraction
of what you're capable of.

02:44.976 --> 02:46.906
Right, I think we all need something

02:46.926 --> 02:47.986
to get us over
this mid-semester slump.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.933
So this weekend,

02:49.953 --> 02:51.988
you're going to be learning circus
skills from seasoned pros.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.902
The weekend, including Sunday?

02:54.923 --> 02:56.982
Why would you desecrate
our one day off?

02:57.901 --> 02:58.992
It's gonna teach you about
trusting your bodies

02:59.909 --> 03:01.987
and trusting each other...

03:02.907 --> 03:04.910
stuff which I think
is very important for you guys.

03:05.949 --> 03:07.932
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:07.952 --> 03:11.911
Um, guys, boarding house,
six o'clock, important announcement.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.917
Sammy, I have to
sort out this thing.

03:13.934 --> 03:14.965
It's cool. You've lived it.

03:14.981 --> 03:17.972
Uh, Abigail. Yeah?

03:17.987 --> 03:19.962
Uh, no excuses, OK?

03:22.913 --> 03:26.887
Mate, I, uh, wasn't feeling a whole
lot of enthusiasm back there.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.886
You're going to have to
lift it up a notch

03:28.906 --> 03:29.934
if you plan on winning
the Nationals.

03:29.949 --> 03:31.924
Winning?

03:31.945 --> 03:34.907
Then representing Australia
at the Prix.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.906
That's what I'm thinking,

03:37.925 --> 03:39.977
but I'm gonna need some help
from your end.

03:44.970 --> 03:48.972
Thanks for being so prompt, guys.
Is popcorn appropriate?

03:49.892 --> 03:50.956
So I wanted to tell you,
the inner sanctum,

03:51.875 --> 03:53.966
before you found out
through anybody else.

03:54.881 --> 03:55.949
Uh...

03:56.953 --> 04:01.891
- I'm seeing Ollie.
- Yay!

04:01.910 --> 04:04.957
I'm so proud of you.
And he is gorgeous.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.927
I knew it. I have the best gaydar.
You have no 'dar'.

04:08.946 --> 04:11.865
And I didn't say I was gay.
I just have a boyfriend.

04:11.881 --> 04:13.865
Kind of hetero-flexible. Cool.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.935
I can't believe I wasted
studio time for this.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.898
OK, so who asked who out?
I'm suffering details deprivation.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.877
I can't believe you're all accepting
it so easily.

04:20.897 --> 04:22.956
Tara, are you shocked, 'cause
you're looking kind of shocked.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.895
I have always wanted
a gay best friend.

04:30.888 --> 04:33.870
Hey. What do you think?

04:33.891 --> 04:37.869
It doesn't run yet,
but it's yours if you want it.

04:37.885 --> 04:40.875
You already got me a surfboard.

04:40.895 --> 04:43.886
I don't think you can buy me
17 years of neglect.

04:43.905 --> 04:47.848
Well, that's a relief,
'cause I don't have any money.

04:47.868 --> 04:51.866
Nah, this is a mate of mine's
and he's trying to get rid of it.

04:51.886 --> 04:54.873
Do me a favour
and see if you can start it?

04:54.889 --> 04:56.863
Yeah, sure.

04:56.884 --> 05:00.842
Yep. Put the clutch in there,
kick down hard on there.

05:04.876 --> 05:05.908
Right-o. Hop off for a sec.

05:08.878 --> 05:10.905
How's school going?

05:10.921 --> 05:12.852
Yeah, it's fine.

05:13.891 --> 05:19.845
There's this teacher, Zach, he's got
all these high expectations for me.

05:19.860 --> 05:20.928
Wants me to be his personal project.

05:21.848 --> 05:25.853
Yeah, I've never coped well
with people like that.

05:25.874 --> 05:29.851
Keep your expectations low,
no-one ever gets disappointed.

05:35.873 --> 05:37.872
I can't believe that was
your first coming out.

05:37.887 --> 05:39.886
I averaged one a week at the Royal.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.824
Kat, um, we're doing
this circus thing this weekend.

05:43.841 --> 05:44.872
It sounds really fun.

05:44.893 --> 05:46.851
Except I think it's for
second years only, T.

05:46.871 --> 05:50.826
No, Zach's all about inclusion.
I'm sure we can win him over.

05:50.841 --> 05:51.889
I mean, only if you wanna come.

05:52.893 --> 05:54.883
Uh, yeah, yeah.

05:54.903 --> 05:58.862
I'm sure I have a sequined leotard
somewhere. See you tomorrow.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.859
Hey, who let you guys in here?

06:29.879 --> 06:32.801
Everyone meet Charlie,
acrobat and...

06:33.840 --> 06:35.820
wife extraordinaire.

06:35.835 --> 06:37.806
Nice work, Zach.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.850
Well, I'm gonna be more like
your flight attendant this weekend.

06:39.869 --> 06:42.884
Your safety's my first priority.
Any questions?

06:44.848 --> 06:47.798
Ballet kids -
no idea what they're in for.

06:47.818 --> 06:49.881
What?!
Huh!

06:50.796 --> 06:52.827
Wow.

06:52.844 --> 06:54.815
Yep. Use those arms.

06:54.830 --> 06:57.881
Yep. Oh, boys, looking great.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.860
Just make sure
that's always tight.

06:59.876 --> 07:05.806
Nice, nice. Hold it. Lovely, Grace.

07:05.821 --> 07:07.784
It's just the same as walking.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.850
That's great, guys.
Remember your core strength.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.848
Oh, my tummy's already cramping.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.815
Snap. We're in sync.

07:17.836 --> 07:19.846
That happens, doesn't it, Sammy?
What?

07:19.867 --> 07:22.813
You get your period
the same time as your best friend.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.776
Best?
Only anecdotally.

07:25.791 --> 07:26.860
It's never been proven.

07:27.775 --> 07:28.814
Wait. Why are you asking me that?

07:28.834 --> 07:31.865
OK, Ben, Christian,
you guys come with me, alright?

07:32.780 --> 07:33.840
Me too, Zach?

07:33.860 --> 07:35.863
Uh, ladies,
you're outside with Charlie.

07:41.784 --> 07:43.815
Wow.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.846
So, the trapeze.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.800
Trapeze is all about the bond
that you have with your flier.

07:49.816 --> 07:52.795
Now, this connection is vital,

07:52.814 --> 07:54.785
because when you're performing
without a net,

07:54.806 --> 07:56.801
you're putting your neck
in someone else's hands.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.834
You should go up there with Grace.

08:02.754 --> 08:05.828
Oh, I doubt we're that compatible,
connectivity-wise.

08:05.849 --> 08:08.771
You have heaps in common.
You're both... Blonde.

08:08.791 --> 08:10.809
You'll like her
once you spend more time with her.

08:10.826 --> 08:12.821
OK, so who's gonna be my first pair?

08:15.747 --> 08:18.746
Yeah?
Um, Grace, you can be catcher.

08:19.797 --> 08:20.841
Come on.

08:30.740 --> 08:32.835
No trapeze for you?

08:33.751 --> 08:35.798
I'm not interested in teamwork.

08:35.818 --> 08:39.799
Hey, what do you think it means
when they equate me with hula hoops?

08:45.813 --> 08:48.780
Look, I'd try
and psyche you out, but...

08:49.827 --> 08:52.782
it's unnecessary.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.745
Have another go.

08:56.727 --> 08:57.823
Can't I be on that.
Like, this is boring.

08:58.743 --> 08:59.822
Have you ever heard of
Philippe Petit?

09:00.738 --> 09:01.770
No.

09:01.789 --> 09:03.808
The man hooked a cable up
between the New York Twin Towers,

09:04.728 --> 09:06.791
walked it for 45 minutes
with no harness,

09:06.807 --> 09:09.757
104 stories up.

09:09.777 --> 09:11.760
And, uh, since you said
it was boring,

09:11.780 --> 09:14.735
you can keep going
till you get to the other side.

09:24.726 --> 09:26.730
Hey.

09:26.745 --> 09:28.772
Yeah, now is a good time.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.754
Oh.

09:35.777 --> 09:39.747
Alright. OK.
Alright, that's good, Grace.

09:39.763 --> 09:40.802
I am a fruit bat.

09:41.718 --> 09:42.790
It's all about timing, OK?

09:46.724 --> 09:48.787
It's a big leap. Here we go.

09:49.702 --> 09:50.738
Don't you trust me?

10:02.775 --> 10:04.783
Ooh.

10:05.698 --> 10:07.713
Harness wedgie. Sorry.

10:22.742 --> 10:24.781
I see you made it
across the tightrope.

10:25.697 --> 10:27.724
Uh, yeah. I grew as a person.

10:29.719 --> 10:31.726
No. I'm not gonna be able
to cross that.

10:31.742 --> 10:33.761
That's the thing. I think you will.

10:33.777 --> 10:36.716
You just need to commit yourself.

10:36.735 --> 10:40.714
Christian, your dad...
Uh, Raf's here.

10:41.761 --> 10:43.708
G'day. I'm Zach.
Hey.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.727
Uh, you're welcome to stick around
and watch if you like.

10:45.747 --> 10:48.753
No, we've got some family things
to do today.

10:49.674 --> 10:54.679
Yeah. I might drag him away
for the afternoon, if that's cool.

10:55.682 --> 10:58.692
Of course. I'll see you tomorrow.
Great.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.696
Great, guys.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.758
Thanks. It's been a long time
since I've wagged school.

11:13.745 --> 11:16.696
You got it running?
Yeah.

11:16.712 --> 11:19.695
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

11:19.711 --> 11:22.669
Or we could do something.

11:23.697 --> 11:24.740
OK.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.689
Make sure you push
with your feet, guys.

11:40.704 --> 11:41.736
Take the pressure off your knees.

11:42.655 --> 11:46.662
Zach. Zach.
Yeah.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.676
I wanna do that.

11:48.697 --> 11:51.656
What, the no-wrap set?
Mate, that's too advanced for you.

11:51.675 --> 11:53.730
I know I used to be weedy.
I acknowledge that.

11:54.649 --> 11:55.697
But I've been working out.
Yeah, I know.

11:55.718 --> 11:57.732
You just have different skills.
What about juggling?

11:58.652 --> 12:00.691
Mate, you were born to be a clown.
Juggling?

12:00.710 --> 12:04.669
Isn't this meant to be about
extending ourselves?

12:05.672 --> 12:08.683
Alright, how are you with heights?
Yeah, mad for them.

12:08.699 --> 12:11.665
Can't get enough.

12:15.675 --> 12:18.726
Come on, T.
You're literally leaving me hanging.

12:33.679 --> 12:37.641
Whoops. Sorry. Sorry.

12:40.715 --> 12:43.650
I thought you
were all about the flying.

12:43.670 --> 12:47.672
I am.
Oh, the little petal was scared?

12:47.692 --> 12:50.694
Of course she's scared, Grace.
She had a broken back.

12:51.614 --> 12:52.693
And do you really have to
talk in that voice?

12:53.613 --> 12:54.669
Kat.
Sorry.

12:54.685 --> 12:56.659
It's just, as the best friend,

12:56.680 --> 12:58.667
you'd think she'd understand
why you might be worried

12:58.683 --> 13:00.629
about getting injured.

13:00.650 --> 13:03.704
Grace does understand. She was
there for me through all of it.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.611
Yeah, unlike you, who made it worse.

13:07.626 --> 13:09.634
And there it is.

13:12.636 --> 13:14.663
Ha. Great jump to my defence, T.

13:15.678 --> 13:17.621
Kat...

13:19.648 --> 13:22.643
Have you forgiven me, or is this
just punishment in close proximity?

13:25.614 --> 13:28.684
I'm sorry. I honestly thought
that if I was over Christian...

13:30.623 --> 13:31.667
But it's what you did.

13:31.682 --> 13:34.594
One kiss.

13:34.609 --> 13:35.641
You guys were broken up.

13:35.661 --> 13:38.607
No, you liked him the whole time
I was with him,

13:38.624 --> 13:40.606
and before that, you lied to me.

13:40.627 --> 13:45.616
I wanna forgive you, but...
But you can't.

13:45.636 --> 13:48.678
So... so, what?
We're never gonna be friends again?

13:52.644 --> 13:54.604
I guess not.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.599
I can't.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.641
It's OK. Just fall like I taught you.

14:07.657 --> 14:09.589
He's having a moment.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.655
Relax. Unwind, so to speak.

14:14.574 --> 14:15.633
Yeah, why don't I just
plummet to my death?

14:15.654 --> 14:17.632
Sammy, you were the one
that begged to do this.

14:17.653 --> 14:20.599
Really? He hates heights.
He hates heights.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.597
Wow.

14:32.614 --> 14:34.568
You still breathing? Come on.

14:34.588 --> 14:36.599
Apart from the lady screams,
that was impressive.

14:36.616 --> 14:38.622
Just get away from me, alright?

14:47.646 --> 14:50.637
So how do you get
your learner's permit for a bike?

14:51.556 --> 14:54.590
Well, you've got to do
a written test first.

14:55.650 --> 14:58.557
I could take you tomorrow,
if you want.

15:00.644 --> 15:02.622
I remember when I first
got my license.

15:02.639 --> 15:04.614
I took this trip down to Tassie.

15:04.634 --> 15:08.568
Thinking about getting back down
there in November.

15:08.588 --> 15:10.603
November?
Mm-hm.

15:10.619 --> 15:13.609
I finish second year around then.

15:13.630 --> 15:17.596
Zach thinks I'll be in this big
competition final, but, you know...

15:17.611 --> 15:19.563
That doesn't sound too bad.

15:19.582 --> 15:24.561
Yeah, but it's, like,
way more pressure than I'm keen on.

15:24.576 --> 15:25.619
Tassie could be cool.

15:27.611 --> 15:31.605
Yeah. Yeah, if you wanted to come.

15:31.621 --> 15:33.564
For sure.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.556
Kat.

15:41.572 --> 15:43.571
Hey.

15:44.578 --> 15:48.548
Yeah, I'm just handing out with...
my dad.

16:12.601 --> 16:15.567
Hey. You know Ness and Will?

16:15.588 --> 16:18.554
What do you think
of our chory assessment?

16:18.575 --> 16:21.536
Hey, can I just talk to you
for a second?

16:21.553 --> 16:23.544
Sure.

16:25.563 --> 16:27.565
Will's organising a futsal team
if you're keen...

16:27.586 --> 16:29.573
Yeah, I wasn't ready
to tell our friends about us.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.563
OK. Did they take it badly?

16:33.566 --> 16:35.578
It's irrelevant.

16:35.597 --> 16:37.573
You should have asked me
before making it public.

16:37.593 --> 16:39.572
OK, I know this is
a big deal for you,

16:39.592 --> 16:42.519
but trust me,
it's better to rip off the bandaid.

16:42.539 --> 16:43.586
You don't want to be
sneaking around.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.541
Yeah, well, maybe I was comfortable
with the bandaid.

16:46.556 --> 16:47.588
You know, a bit of time

16:48.508 --> 16:50.530
to figure out whether I wanted to
alter my entire life.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.557
But no, thank you
for deciding that for me.

16:54.569 --> 16:56.564
It's premature anyway.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.531
Shortest relationship ever.

17:08.526 --> 17:10.549
You should come watch me
get my learner's today.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.536
Help me cheat.

17:12.556 --> 17:14.555
Um, no, no.
You spend time with your dad.

17:14.570 --> 17:17.553
Does that sound weird? 'My dad'?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.525
It sounds awesome.

17:19.544 --> 17:23.499
And, um, you're right
to go back to the circus?

17:27.492 --> 17:28.564
I'm not gonna be pushed out.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.524
Running away and joining the circus

17:30.543 --> 17:31.571
has always been my back-up plan,
so...

17:32.491 --> 17:34.513
So I've heard. Alright.
I gotta go. Bye.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.561
Good luck.
Thanks.

18:01.504 --> 18:04.463
You've been quiet
on the love front lately.

18:04.483 --> 18:08.465
Anybody in your sights?
Why?

18:08.485 --> 18:10.460
Well, I broke up with Ollie
last night,

18:10.476 --> 18:13.526
so we're both available, you know.

18:13.547 --> 18:15.554
What is wrong with you
at the moment?

18:16.469 --> 18:17.500
Nothing.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.522
Oh. OK. So you don't see me
as a contender now either.

18:23.542 --> 18:25.521
I go out with a guy
for half a second,

18:25.541 --> 18:28.455
and suddenly,
I'm not one of the guys anymore.

18:28.471 --> 18:31.529
I'm Sensitive Sammy.

18:32.450 --> 18:35.480
Wake up, Lieberman.
That's who you've always been.

18:37.495 --> 18:38.539
I have?

18:39.458 --> 18:40.525
Yeah, that was
until you sat me down...

18:40.542 --> 18:42.473
your ex-girlfriend...

18:42.492 --> 18:46.443
in front of a room full of people
to tell me you now have a boyfriend.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.498
Like, without any consideration
how that would affect me.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.472
Suddenly not so sensitive.

18:57.521 --> 19:00.436
You don't get dibs
on feeling betrayed, Tara.

19:00.456 --> 19:01.500
Please, can we just not...
Yes.

19:01.519 --> 19:04.521
I liked Christian all that time, OK,
but I tried to make it go away

19:05.442 --> 19:07.529
because hurting you is the equivalent
of cutting off my own arm.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.447
But that doesn't go both ways,
does it?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.517
YOU are the one
that ended our friendship,

19:14.433 --> 19:16.496
like it never meant anything,

19:16.516 --> 19:20.462
so you don't get dibs
on feeling betrayed.

19:27.475 --> 19:29.470
Hey, Christian.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.516
I ran into Raf in the car park.
He asked me to give you this.

19:43.503 --> 19:48.444
Hey. Good, you caught me.
Yeah.

19:48.465 --> 19:52.442
Uh, look.
Uh, I didn't want to get in the way.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.482
I know you've got a lot to do.

19:54.501 --> 19:57.440
I guess it wouldn't involve getting
my learner's today, would it?

19:57.456 --> 19:59.459
Yeah, look, I'm not the best teacher.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.445
Sorry, it's just...
Sydney's a bit full-on.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.407
Sure.

20:08.427 --> 20:12.457
If I'm doing something this summer,
I'll give you a text, alright?

20:32.431 --> 20:33.479
When I broke my back,

20:34.398 --> 20:35.478
there was a good chance
the fracture might never heal...

20:36.393 --> 20:37.441
I'm not gonna drop you.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.388
And a very small chance

20:39.408 --> 20:41.459
that the bone would end up
stronger than it was before.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.426
Got you, T.
I know.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.379
Then another break happened,

21:05.400 --> 21:08.402
and the odds must have been
on my side,

21:08.422 --> 21:11.420
because I no longer have
a best friend.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.463
I have something stronger.

21:15.379 --> 21:17.381
A sister...

21:17.398 --> 21:19.369
who I would trust with my life.

21:21.404 --> 21:24.442
I think that's why we do
trust exercises.

21:24.459 --> 21:27.393
Ollie, wait up.

21:27.413 --> 21:31.414
Because most of the time, the problem
isn't only with the other person.

21:33.374 --> 21:35.401
My friends, they weren't...

21:36.408 --> 21:38.403
They weren't shocked or outraged.

21:38.420 --> 21:41.418
That was... that was only me.

21:43.425 --> 21:45.428
I just don't wanna be someone
who had a boyfriend.

21:45.448 --> 21:50.405
Sammy, dude,
you never had a boyfriend.

21:50.426 --> 21:53.400
You had an Ollie.
Stop making him sound generic.

21:53.420 --> 21:56.371
Did you just talk
about yourself in the third person?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.444
So we're good, right?

22:04.371 --> 22:05.415
We're good.

22:13.347 --> 22:14.402
The hardest part of pas de deux

22:14.422 --> 22:16.433
is trusting yourself
to trust someone else.

22:18.388 --> 22:20.383
Zach...

22:20.404 --> 22:23.342
stop trying to make me
your project.

22:23.362 --> 22:25.425
I don't need you telling me
to win Nationals

22:26.341 --> 22:28.344
'cause that's just not me, alright?

22:28.363 --> 22:30.422
Sure. Except you came
all the way over here to say that.

22:31.342 --> 22:33.377
Maybe I'm not cut out
to commit to anything.

22:33.397 --> 22:37.347
Maybe I just want to
walk away from all of it.

22:38.351 --> 22:42.356
I don't think so, mate.
I don't think that's you at all.

22:46.386 --> 22:49.338
Just one foot in front of the other.

22:49.357 --> 22:52.387
Just focus on the end.
Focus on the end.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.335
That's it.

22:57.389 --> 23:00.360
You need someone there
to steady you,

23:00.376 --> 23:03.331
to put their faith in you

23:03.346 --> 23:04.390
so you can be...

23:06.373 --> 23:08.352
extraordinary.
