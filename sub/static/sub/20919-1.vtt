suffer Thor's hammer.

11:59.925 --> 12:02.760
You have made a terrible
mistake in coming here.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.437
So it appears.

12:05.956 --> 12:08.073
[Captain America]
Black Panther? Thor?

12:08.151 --> 12:09.492
There you are.

12:10.260 --> 12:13.659
You can't run off on your own
like that, Thor. We're a team.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.917
A team that
could not save Tony.

12:16.065 --> 12:18.651
I will do what I must
to protect my friends,

12:18.713 --> 12:21.034
and if that means my life
should be forfeit in battle,

12:21.143 --> 12:23.440
Captain, then so be it.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.206
The Leader
reached the Vibranium.

12:25.276 --> 12:27.198
We stopped him just in time.

12:27.393 --> 12:28.979
On the contrary.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.479
You did exactly
what I expected.

12:31.659 --> 12:33.823
Without Iron Man,
you win battles,

12:33.893 --> 12:36.206
while you cannot
even see the war.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.416
Meet my new Cabal.

12:41.018 --> 12:45.010
The Enchantress,
Asgardian master of magic.

12:45.252 --> 12:48.456
And the Asgardian warrior,
Skurge.

12:48.651 --> 12:51.893
Arnim Zola,
brilliant Hydra commander.

12:52.127 --> 12:56.455
Kang the Conqueror,
ruler from the 30th century.

12:58.049 --> 13:00.159
[grunts]
[grunts]

13:00.276 --> 13:03.956
Kang, see to
our esteemed Leader.

13:04.143 --> 13:07.518
I didn't join your Cabal
to be your rescuer.

13:07.737 --> 13:11.081
No, you joined the Cabal
to get the Avengers.

13:11.606 --> 13:13.739
So what's stopping you?

13:16.807 --> 13:20.377
Finally, a chance to unwind.

13:25.088 --> 13:26.376
[grunting]

13:26.487 --> 13:29.338
Enchantress!
I'll see that you're locked

13:29.448 --> 13:31.713
in the deepest dungeons
of Asgard!

13:31.870 --> 13:34.487
Thor, son of Odin.

13:34.659 --> 13:36.776
I see you haven't forgotten me.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.284
And you remember Skurge?

13:39.557 --> 13:41.792
[both grunting]

13:43.948 --> 13:45.792
Captain America.

13:45.901 --> 13:48.737
The vengeance
I've dreamt of for so long

13:48.854 --> 13:51.034
is nearly at hand.

13:52.072 --> 13:53.271
[grunts]

13:53.319 --> 13:55.315
Keep dreaming, Zola.

13:57.829 --> 13:59.061
[grunts]

13:59.588 --> 14:02.306
Interesting.
Your skill set is impressive.

14:02.456 --> 14:06.417
- I never realized. [grunts]
- You realize it now?

14:06.752 --> 14:08.026
[grunting]

14:10.127 --> 14:11.893
[grunts]

14:12.825 --> 14:13.891
[roars]

14:14.254 --> 14:15.386
[grunting]

14:15.461 --> 14:16.994
[roars]

14:21.771 --> 14:23.538
[grunts]

14:28.479 --> 14:30.151
[grunts]

14:30.651 --> 14:34.448
Thank you for your hospitality
and the lovely parting gift.

14:34.566 --> 14:37.940
Come, my Cabal.
We have what we came for.

14:42.697 --> 14:46.042
Enchantress,
let's tuck in our friends.

14:46.497 --> 14:47.963
[chuckling]

14:48.277 --> 14:50.310
As you wish.

14:55.543 --> 14:57.576
We're trapped.
[grunts]

14:58.513 --> 14:59.588
[grunts]

15:00.649 --> 15:01.829
[gasps]

15:05.394 --> 15:06.880
[grunts]

15:11.075 --> 15:12.675
[yells]
[roars]

15:13.622 --> 15:15.716
[grunts]

15:15.805 --> 15:16.937
[straining]

15:16.985 --> 15:19.106
[yells]

15:21.219 --> 15:22.747
[growling]

15:23.341 --> 15:25.739
Hawkeye,
can you hit a target?

15:25.849 --> 15:27.700
Well, duh.
It's kind of what I do.

15:27.848 --> 15:30.940
You know, saying "well, duh,"
to the king is punishable by...

15:30.988 --> 15:32.927
Fine, fine, fine, fine. Sorry.
What do you want me to hit?

15:32.974 --> 15:36.776
Far wall, red button. It controls
the mansion's defense systems.

15:37.489 --> 15:38.684
[grunts]

15:41.976 --> 15:43.010
[beeps]

15:44.475 --> 15:45.628
[grunts]

15:46.752 --> 15:47.851
[grunts]

15:48.246 --> 15:49.690
[growling]

15:52.678 --> 15:53.743
[grunts]

15:58.767 --> 16:01.735
No more monkey business!

16:05.857 --> 16:07.450
[Falcon]
I've got a fix on the Cabal.

16:07.529 --> 16:10.294
They're a few miles straight
up, in a ship above the city.

16:10.935 --> 16:11.904
[grunts]

16:11.952 --> 16:13.184
Aah!
[grunts]

16:13.338 --> 16:14.989
Unhand me!

16:15.194 --> 16:17.027
Can't do this
by yourself.

16:17.132 --> 16:20.167
I tried it before.
Doesn't work.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.169
[Black Panther]
Everyone aboard my jet.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.802
A ride fit for a king.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.324
[Black Panther] We will overtake
the Cabal in one minute.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.013
Leader's going
to see us coming.

16:33.061 --> 16:34.841
No, he will not.

16:36.614 --> 16:39.927
Stealth mode is no match
for Asgardian magics.

16:40.544 --> 16:44.400
Did you really think
your technology would hide you?

16:53.077 --> 16:55.244
[growling]

16:56.673 --> 16:58.699
And it's a dragon.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.496
[Black Panther]
Everyone, hold on!

17:11.395 --> 17:12.515
[grunts]

17:14.605 --> 17:16.894
We can't avoid
that dragon forever.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.722
I will take care of it myself.

17:20.770 --> 17:23.472
- Right with ya, Thor.
- Falcon, no!

17:39.387 --> 17:42.266
Ha! Too easy.

17:44.598 --> 17:48.004
I cannot keep her in the air.
We have lost inertial guidance.

17:48.065 --> 17:51.622
Then we go straight in, as soon as we
get Zola's cannon out of commission.

17:51.724 --> 17:54.207
Steady, Hulk.
Try to hold me steady!

17:54.372 --> 17:57.273
Ugh! Quit complaining
and shoot!

18:00.244 --> 18:01.443
[grunts]

18:14.912 --> 18:16.576
Your bravery is inspiring.

18:16.624 --> 18:18.623
I was wrong
to act without you.

18:18.893 --> 18:20.740
We must move forward together,

18:20.826 --> 18:24.139
as I can only protect you
as much as you can protect me.

18:24.302 --> 18:25.396
Yep.

18:26.237 --> 18:28.631
Now look who's
an unwelcome guest.

18:29.110 --> 18:31.881
Cutting our link to Tony,
the prototype core,

18:32.122 --> 18:34.222
the Vibranium,
the Cabal.

18:34.428 --> 18:36.146
What's your game,
Leader?

18:36.646 --> 18:39.225
Mm, don't think too hard,
Captain.

18:39.365 --> 18:42.896
I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.
That's our job.

18:42.999 --> 18:45.006
Cabal, attack!

18:50.190 --> 18:51.834
[Hulk grunts]

18:54.227 --> 18:56.305
[grunting]
[groans]

18:57.523 --> 18:58.852
[grunts]

19:00.074 --> 19:01.773
[both grunting]

19:04.677 --> 19:08.508
Fight, Skurge,
and crush Thor for me.

19:12.316 --> 19:17.477
If you had but a gram of intelligence
between you, you would run away.

19:21.039 --> 19:24.266
Run away?
Where's the fun in that?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.324
[grunts]

19:30.273 --> 19:32.805
You are no match
for my chemistry,

19:32.903 --> 19:35.305
or my weaponry.
[grunts]

19:35.516 --> 19:37.414
[grunting]

19:37.531 --> 19:39.578
Gotta... fight it...

19:39.783 --> 19:41.949
Hey, Zola! Catch!

19:43.431 --> 19:45.398
[screaming]

19:47.318 --> 19:49.414
[grunting]

19:51.117 --> 19:54.094
Do you like magic,
green ogre?

19:57.128 --> 19:58.427
Evil witch!

19:58.555 --> 20:00.453
Hulk hate magic!

20:00.648 --> 20:02.008
[thud]
[grunts]

20:02.294 --> 20:04.664
My lady!
[grunts]

20:04.753 --> 20:07.492
You'll pay for that,
you beast!

20:09.789 --> 20:11.297
[grunts]

20:12.255 --> 20:14.133
Aw, thanks, Cap.
[grunts]

20:14.516 --> 20:15.528
[grunts]

20:16.179 --> 20:17.570
I have an idea, Hawkeye,

20:17.742 --> 20:20.383
but I need to get behind them
and attack their blindside.

20:20.477 --> 20:24.219
- You saying you need cover?
- Well, duh.

20:27.641 --> 20:28.945
Hmm.

20:31.395 --> 20:34.442
[grunts] I have your
back, and you have mine.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.131
We fight together!

20:36.332 --> 20:38.762
Right where
I want them.

20:38.982 --> 20:40.621
Kang, now!

20:43.107 --> 20:45.960
[all screaming]

20:46.139 --> 20:48.850
Perhaps Stark would've seen
the trap coming.

20:48.925 --> 20:50.881
But I guess we'll never know.

20:51.102 --> 20:54.608
You're going to be test subjects
for my new Static Expander.

20:54.771 --> 20:57.077
You may recognize
the crucial parts...

20:57.202 --> 21:00.850
Dr. Foster's invention,
Vibranium as the focal point.

21:00.976 --> 21:04.866
And now I have a target...
The Avengers.

21:05.185 --> 21:07.115
There's one missing.

21:07.218 --> 21:09.327
Who is still out there?

21:16.554 --> 21:19.968
What did they say
about curiosity and the cat?

21:20.164 --> 21:21.742
[chuckling]

21:22.226 --> 21:24.054
[laughing]

21:24.215 --> 21:26.381
