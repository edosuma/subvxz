00:01.750 --> 00:03.753
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.753 --> 00:06.589
MARTY: We're going to get a look
 at the seismic results.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.842
This is definitely
the largest anomaly.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.760
It is a competent structure,
whatever it is.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.429
Is that consistent
with a chamber?

00:13.429 --> 00:15.055
Yeah. It is.

00:15.055 --> 00:17.141
MARTY:
 Now we have a target,

00:17.141 --> 00:19.227
so we need to drill it right
away, find out what it is.

00:19.227 --> 00:22.646
TERRY: Wow, look at that.
This is a lot of wood here.

00:22.646 --> 00:23.897
MARTY:
 Maybe it is the old Money Pit.

00:23.897 --> 00:25.899
GARY:
Look at this! This is old.

00:25.899 --> 00:28.193
We're talking, like,
Templar old.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.159
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:35.159 --> 00:38.496
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.496 --> 00:41.750
for more than 200 years.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.668
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.668 --> 00:47.296
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.296 --> 00:50.091
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.091 --> 00:54.179
and a lead cross,
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.179 --> 00:56.847
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.847 --> 01:01.226
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.226 --> 01:04.272
And, according to legend,

01:04.272 --> 01:07.358
one more will have to die

01:07.358 --> 01:11.069
before the treasure
can be found.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.793
It is a day
of great anticipation

01:24.793 --> 01:27.629
for brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:27.629 --> 01:31.632
and the other members
of their Oak Island team...

01:31.632 --> 01:34.259
-Looked like a wide road
until we got on it.
-MICHEL: Yeah.

01:34.259 --> 01:36.304
NARRATOR: ...because today
 marks the first day

01:36.304 --> 01:38.305
in the construction

01:38.305 --> 01:43.269
of an enormous 525-foot-long
cofferdam at Smith's Cove,

01:43.269 --> 01:45.896
one of the most intriguing
and mysterious places

01:45.896 --> 01:47.816
on the island.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.819
It looks like
a really sturdy pad.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.361
It'll just gradually
start coming together

01:52.361 --> 01:54.322
over the next couple of days.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.865
NARRATOR:
 When completed,

01:55.865 --> 01:58.325
the cofferdam
will effectively wall off

01:58.325 --> 02:00.328
ocean water to the cove.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.496
JACK: We have quite
a reach with this crane.

02:02.496 --> 02:04.540
MIKE J.: We've got quite
a reach, but it takes

02:04.540 --> 02:06.000
every bit of that crane

02:06.000 --> 02:07.751
-to reach what we need to do.
-All right.

02:07.751 --> 02:11.548
NARRATOR: Using a powerful
 hydraulic hammer,

02:11.548 --> 02:15.384
approximately 120 interlocking
steel sheets

02:15.384 --> 02:18.847
will be driven some 25 feet
into the ground.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.223
This will allow the water
to be drained,

02:21.223 --> 02:24.686
and then the entire area
searched for important clues--

02:24.686 --> 02:27.563
clues that might help
the Laginas solve

02:27.563 --> 02:31.025
a 223-year-old
treasure mystery.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.027
It may also help them locate
an elaborate system

02:34.027 --> 02:35.737
of booby-trapped flood tunnels

02:35.737 --> 02:38.031
that have thwarted searchers
from exploring

02:38.031 --> 02:44.038
the so-called Money Pit
located some 170 yards away.

02:44.038 --> 02:47.917
MARTY: Every time Smith's Cove
 has been searched in the past,

02:47.917 --> 02:49.877
it's been just
an earthen cofferdam.

02:49.877 --> 02:51.336
More or less similar

02:51.336 --> 02:53.506
to the bladder system
we used last year.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.593
I mean, there's so much seepage
under there, through the sands

02:56.593 --> 02:59.596
and the gravel and whatever
underneath there,

02:59.596 --> 03:02.473
that it's working
in constant flooding.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.975
So this time,
we're gonna drive sheet piling

03:04.975 --> 03:07.061
down 23 feet and interlock it.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.772
That should stop
the bulk of the water.

03:10.772 --> 03:14.360
What is, realistically,
the closest time frame

03:14.360 --> 03:16.820
to when we start
being able to dig

03:16.820 --> 03:18.907
and excavate in Smith's Cove
this year?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.908
We're anticipating
about three weeks' work

03:20.908 --> 03:22.911
from the time we started today

03:22.911 --> 03:25.121
until we can probably
turn it over to you folks.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.497
-Right on schedule, basically.
-Yeah.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.875
JACK: And then we can get
started and see

03:28.875 --> 03:31.461
if there's anything else
hiding down in Smith's Cove.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.586
-Yes.
-PETER: Absolutely.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.425
NARRATOR: As the team from
 Irving Equipment Limited

03:37.425 --> 03:41.346
continues with their operation
at Smith's Cove...

03:41.346 --> 03:43.932
-MARTY:
This should be a good day.
-RICK: Absolutely.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.308
NARRATOR: ...brothers
 Rick and Marty Lagina

03:46.308 --> 03:49.145
along with Craig Tester,
Dave Blankenship

03:49.145 --> 03:51.271
and Charles Barkhouse

03:51.271 --> 03:55.485
are traveling some 2,300 miles
west of Oak Island

03:55.485 --> 03:58.947
to the city of Calgary
in Alberta, Canada.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.116
MARTY:
 Seismo, here we go.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.992
I'm looking forward to it,
that's for sure.

04:03.992 --> 04:06.621
-It should give us
some good targets.
-Yeah.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.122
NARRATOR:
 They are on their way

04:08.122 --> 04:10.123
to the headquarters
of Eagle Canada...

04:12.460 --> 04:14.378
...a geophysical
exploration company

04:14.378 --> 04:17.130
which over the past two weeks
has conducted

04:17.130 --> 04:20.759
a major seismic imaging scan
of the Money Pit site.

04:22.971 --> 04:27.350
This revolutionary process
involves the detonation

04:27.350 --> 04:31.812
of literally hundreds
of explosive dynamite charges.

04:31.812 --> 04:35.649
These charges send powerful
shockwaves down into the earth

04:35.649 --> 04:38.485
which are then measured
and recorded,

04:38.485 --> 04:42.447
allowing for the creation of
a virtual three-dimensional map

04:42.447 --> 04:46.159
which, in turn, could reveal
the precise location

04:46.159 --> 04:49.872
of everything from old searcher
tunnels and booby traps

04:49.872 --> 04:53.959
to underground treasure vaults.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.254
CHARLES:
 I'm excited.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.672
This is the first opportunity

04:57.672 --> 05:00.382
that people can
look underground.

05:00.382 --> 05:02.009
-Yep.
-CRAIG: Yeah, and the mega-bin

05:02.009 --> 05:04.345
should be in an area
with excellent data.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.014
Where is that?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.557
That's the Triton Shaft,
where Dan, you know,

05:08.557 --> 05:10.685
felt he hit the tunnel
and they brought up wood.

05:10.685 --> 05:14.605
NARRATOR: Also included in
 the seismic scanning operation

05:14.605 --> 05:18.358
was another search area
known as the mega-bin,

05:18.358 --> 05:22.904
located some 600 feet north
of the Money Pit site.

05:22.904 --> 05:26.867
It was here,
in the early 1970s,

05:26.867 --> 05:29.954
that veteran treasure hunter
Dan Blankenship

05:29.954 --> 05:31.956
and his company,
The Triton Alliance,

05:31.956 --> 05:34.792
drilled some
40 exploratory boreholes

05:34.792 --> 05:36.711
searching for tunnels

05:36.711 --> 05:40.465
that Dan believed were
connected to the Money Pit.

05:40.465 --> 05:44.259
We're going to get a look
at the seismic results,

05:44.259 --> 05:46.637
which we're very excited to see.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.264
I do have high hopes

05:49.264 --> 05:52.894
for them being able to see
vertical structures.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.646
We each have our own little
version of what that might be,

05:55.646 --> 05:57.774
you know, mental image
of what that might be.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.692
But in any event,

05:59.692 --> 06:03.571
this is the first time we might
get some scientific imaging

06:03.571 --> 06:07.033
of what's going on underground,
both at the Money Pit

06:07.033 --> 06:09.494
and over there on the hillside
by the Triton shaft.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.661
(indistinct chatter)

06:11.661 --> 06:13.247
-Morning, gentlemen.
-Hey, guys.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.624
ROBERT W.: Hey, good morning.
Have a seat.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.834
Welcome to Calgary.
Welcome to Eagle.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.877
ALEX G.: So, I'm glad you guys
were able to make it.

06:18.877 --> 06:21.422
Uh, we got some pretty exciting
news today.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.257
-Great.
-So I'll let Jeremy
talk about the results.

06:24.257 --> 06:26.343
-MARTY: Okay.
-So let's jump into it.

06:26.343 --> 06:31.557
Here is the lay of the two 3-Ds
and the 2-D line mega-bins

06:31.557 --> 06:35.103
up there to the north and then
the orthogonal down here

06:35.103 --> 06:37.521
to the south over the Money Pit.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.108
So here's the mega-bin.

06:41.108 --> 06:44.069
This map is built
from an amplitude slice.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.737
MARTY: And the significance
of the colors?

06:45.737 --> 06:49.324
JEREMY: Um, reds usually
represent reductions in density,

06:49.324 --> 06:51.034
negative values or troughs.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.702
Typically, reductions in density

06:52.702 --> 06:54.956
are usually
the more interesting features.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.415
So yeah, there's your mega-bin
right there.

06:57.415 --> 07:03.004
This is definitely the largest
anomaly in this data set so far.

07:03.004 --> 07:04.464
It's roughly 50 meters long,

07:04.464 --> 07:07.968
so you're in
the 150-175 foot length.

07:07.968 --> 07:11.430
What would the distance be
between the top and the base?

07:11.430 --> 07:13.641
-Seven to 12 feet.
-Can you dimension that?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.643
JEREMY: Yeah, I'll give you
a cross section.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.478
So here it is.

07:17.478 --> 07:22.065
We're around
the 40-ish, 50-foot depth there.

07:22.065 --> 07:24.360
So, like, the anomaly is this.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.653
You've got a hard reflector
on top,

07:25.653 --> 07:27.487
a hard reflector on the base.

07:27.487 --> 07:30.490
What's interesting is things
are draping on top of it,

07:30.490 --> 07:33.161
so it is a competent structure,
whatever it is.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.579
Is that consistent
with a chamber,

07:35.579 --> 07:37.874
with a roof and a floor?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.040
Yeah. It is.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.543
Wow.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.920
NARRATOR:
 A 175-foot chamber,

07:43.920 --> 07:48.884
located at a depth
of approximately 50 feet?

07:48.884 --> 07:52.721
Could this discovery finally be
the proof the Laginas

07:52.721 --> 07:55.516
and generations of other
treasure hunters

07:55.516 --> 07:59.437
have been trying to find
for more than two centuries?

07:59.437 --> 08:03.274
Proof that man-made structures
really do exist

08:03.274 --> 08:06.194
beneath the surface
of Oak Island?

08:06.194 --> 08:10.531
Structures that might contain
an incredible treasure?

08:10.531 --> 08:12.699
It's astounding, even,
what you've drawn,

08:12.699 --> 08:14.701
right there already,
because Dan told

08:14.701 --> 08:17.079
Rick and I years ago
that he had drilled that well,

08:17.079 --> 08:20.249
the so-called latrine hole,
and he believed at the time

08:20.249 --> 08:24.461
that it was the "relief area"
for an underground chamber

08:24.461 --> 08:26.338
where people were working,
and he was quite sure.

08:26.338 --> 08:28.132
He was absolutely certain.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.134
And he kind of drew something
that looked just like that.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.509
So it's just incredible.

08:31.509 --> 08:33.721
I'm very excited

08:33.721 --> 08:35.889
to see that they've imaged
what they hope

08:35.889 --> 08:38.893
is some sort of chamber,
and it's only at 50 feet.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.312
RICK: For me, personally,
 I've always wanted

08:41.312 --> 08:43.773
to give Dan his breakthrough,
and now we have

08:43.773 --> 08:48.235
a target, a defined target,
not a hope and a poke scenario.

08:48.235 --> 08:50.613
That, I can tell you for sure,

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
that's going to figure
in our exploration plans.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.075
We're not gonna
walk away from that.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.743
JEREMY:
Okay, so, uh,

08:55.743 --> 08:58.495
-we'll move on to the Money Pit.
-The Money Pit.

08:58.495 --> 08:59.788
-Yes.
-MARTY: Yes.

08:59.788 --> 09:01.374
JEREMY:
So here's the first anomaly

09:01.374 --> 09:03.500
I want to show you
from this area.

09:03.500 --> 09:08.630
This is below any
of the historical excavations.

09:08.630 --> 09:11.174
It is also interesting
how you have,

09:11.174 --> 09:13.510
basically, a large blue region

09:13.510 --> 09:14.720
-of nothing really happening...
-All around it.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.429
...and then this emerges
out of it.

09:17.764 --> 09:20.017
So, here's our limestone,

09:20.017 --> 09:22.186
consistent limestone marker,
here's the anhydrate marker.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.940
And then you have a hard roof

09:25.940 --> 09:28.525
with a void
within the limestone.

09:28.525 --> 09:30.903
There's C-1,

09:30.903 --> 09:34.365
and then H-8, interestingly,
he's kind of on the edge of it.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.076
What depth are we here?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.287
160 to 170 feet.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.788
NARRATOR:
 A large void,

09:41.788 --> 09:46.961
located at a depth
of 160 to 170 feet?

09:46.961 --> 09:49.297
And adjacent
to the C-1 and H-8 boreholes

09:49.297 --> 09:53.301
that Rick and Marty
dug in the Money Pit?

09:53.301 --> 09:56.636
That's where a lot
of odd stuff came out of, H-8.

09:56.636 --> 09:59.472
-(clattering)
-DANNY: We are definitely
sitting on something.

09:59.472 --> 10:02.475
It feels like I'm on a whole
bunch of wood at once now.

10:02.475 --> 10:06.022
NARRATOR: Last year,
 while drilling borehole H-8,

10:06.022 --> 10:08.982
the Oak Island team found
compelling evidence

10:08.982 --> 10:12.403
of what they believed to be
the so-called Chappell Vault,

10:12.403 --> 10:15.405
the seven-foot-tall wooden box,
first discovered

10:15.405 --> 10:20.244
by William Chappell
and Frederick Blair in 1897.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.331
It was while searching
the spoils from this same hole

10:23.331 --> 10:24.914
that the team also made

10:24.914 --> 10:27.960
a number
of incredible discoveries...

10:27.960 --> 10:29.461
TERRY: Okay, that's
 kind of interesting.

10:29.461 --> 10:31.504
NARRATOR:
 ...including pottery,

10:31.504 --> 10:34.466
bits of parchment
and leather bookbinding,

10:34.466 --> 10:38.428
and even pieces of human bones,
which, when tested,

10:38.428 --> 10:42.015
were determined to be the
remains of two individuals:

10:42.015 --> 10:45.602
one from Europe, and the other
from the Middle East.

10:45.602 --> 10:51.024
And each estimated to be
more than 400 years old.

10:51.024 --> 10:55.111
Unfortunately, when the team
attempted to penetrate

10:55.111 --> 10:58.573
the suspected vault with
a 60-inch-wide drilling caisson

10:58.573 --> 11:01.701
the object was
pushed lower down

11:01.701 --> 11:04.830
into the wet, muddy ground.

11:04.830 --> 11:09.751
Could this large chamber
located near the H-8 shaft

11:09.751 --> 11:13.630
be where the elusive
Chappell Vault is now located?

11:13.630 --> 11:15.924
If it is real, it could answer
a lot of stuff.

11:15.924 --> 11:18.969
It could explain where
we pushed that vault down to.

11:18.969 --> 11:22.431
You know, if there's
a-a cavity over there

11:22.431 --> 11:24.182
that has been breached,

11:24.182 --> 11:26.894
then maybe that's where
the stuff went.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.188
Maybe it is the bottom
of the old Money Pit.

11:30.188 --> 11:35.568
You end up at H-8 here
being at the extremity of it.

11:35.568 --> 11:39.155
Like, all your, uh,
caissons are over there.

11:39.155 --> 11:40.448
We missed it by this much.

11:40.448 --> 11:42.326
(laughter)

11:42.326 --> 11:46.996
It's touching the edge
of that cavern or void.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.749
JEREMY:
It has a squared-off shape.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.000
You just don't--
nature doesn't tend to produce

11:51.000 --> 11:52.753
such square features,
you know, like that.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.797
-Yeah, exactly.
-MARTY: Yeah.

11:54.797 --> 11:59.342
That's obviously dramatic and
it needs to be looked into.

11:59.342 --> 12:01.261
There's no question about that.

12:01.261 --> 12:02.596
And it gets better.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.769
-JEREMY: And it gets better.
-MARTY: Really?

12:09.769 --> 12:11.730
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.066
NARRATOR: While visiting the
 headquarters of Eagle Canada

12:14.066 --> 12:17.278
in Alberta, Canada,
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

12:17.278 --> 12:19.779
along with members
of the Oak Island team,

12:19.779 --> 12:23.783
have just been given
the startling information

12:23.783 --> 12:26.162
that seismic scanning
has revealed the existence

12:26.162 --> 12:28.788
of underground voids
in the Money Pit area,

12:28.788 --> 12:34.128
voids that appear to surround
the borehole known as H-8.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.298
This anomaly here,
very interesting.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.799
When you start seeing
eyeball-type features

12:39.799 --> 12:41.759
that's usually
something notable.

12:41.759 --> 12:44.971
So I grabbed a slice
through that.

12:44.971 --> 12:47.224
Here's C-1. Here's H-8.

12:47.224 --> 12:52.645
This complex of linear features
that kind of come off of it,

12:52.645 --> 12:54.981
that carries on into what
looks like a larger network

12:54.981 --> 12:57.485
around the 100
to 110 foot-ish range.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.820
-Flood tunnel?
-CHARLES: Could be.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.654
Wow.

13:01.654 --> 13:03.240
NARRATOR:
 A flood tunnel

13:03.240 --> 13:06.576
located at a depth of
approximately 100 feet?

13:06.576 --> 13:08.828
Certainly, it's possible

13:08.828 --> 13:10.413
that it's a flood tunnel.

13:10.413 --> 13:12.541
It does beg
for further investigation.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.125
MARTY: All right, well,
we're going to have

13:14.125 --> 13:15.878
to figure out what we do
with this new data here.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.837
-My understanding
is you would like...
-Yeah.

13:17.837 --> 13:20.508
-to do some more
number crunching.
-Yeah.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.676
MARTY:
I'm very excited about this.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.595
So, I want to explore this.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.721
I think there's
enough data right now

13:26.721 --> 13:27.722
-for us to do something here.
-Yeah.

13:27.722 --> 13:29.390
-RICK: Yes.
-Yeah.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.559
You've given us reason
to certainly move forward,

13:31.559 --> 13:35.147
-you know, and-and we have
intentions of drilling holes.
-Yeah.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.692
-Yeah.
-I would like to see
some more investigation

13:38.692 --> 13:44.280
of these two sites, for sure,
and that's awesome.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.115
MARTY:
All right, we thank you.

13:46.115 --> 13:48.826
We look forward to lots more
work, lots more data

13:48.826 --> 13:51.120
and, um, let's get out there
and do something.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.664
-Awesome. -Awesome.
-MARTY: We're done.

13:52.664 --> 13:55.709
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.879
NARRATOR: While Rick, Marty
 and members of the team

13:58.879 --> 14:02.674
eagerly make their way
back to Oak Island,

14:02.674 --> 14:07.888
Jack Begley, Gary Drayton and
area geophysicist Mike West

14:07.888 --> 14:10.515
head to the beach on Lot 26,

14:10.515 --> 14:13.811
located on the island's
southwest shore.

14:13.811 --> 14:18.190
They have come here in hopes
of finding historical artifacts

14:18.190 --> 14:21.610
like the gold-covered brooch
Gary and Rick Lagina discovered

14:21.610 --> 14:24.779
just one week ago
and which was estimated

14:24.779 --> 14:27.740
to be as much as 700 years old.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.411
We're going to be working
in tandem.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.538
Mike's got different metal
detecting equipment to me

14:33.538 --> 14:37.125
and he's going to be
looking for targets,

14:37.125 --> 14:40.211
hopefully deeper targets
than I can detect.

14:40.211 --> 14:45.091
Then I'm going to cross off
any shallow surface finds

14:45.091 --> 14:47.760
with my surface metal detector.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.139
This looks like a point here,

14:50.139 --> 14:52.307
all the way down here
with the boulders.

14:52.307 --> 14:53.683
This could potentially be a...

14:53.683 --> 14:55.269
MIKE W.:
Yeah, there's definitely

14:55.269 --> 14:56.729
-something going on here.
-...a landing spot.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.355
Yeah.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.107
And what do people do
when they come up by a boat?

15:01.107 --> 15:03.110
-They lose stuff getting
on and off boats.
-Yeah.

15:03.110 --> 15:06.779
JACK: Mm-hmm. If anything,
it almost makes more sense

15:06.779 --> 15:08.615
because this is Captain
Anderson's property.

15:08.615 --> 15:13.787
-He was one of the original
owners of Lot 26.
-Yeah.

15:13.787 --> 15:19.083
NARRATOR: During the American
 Revolution in 1783,

15:19.083 --> 15:22.629
Captain James Anderson
was a privateer

15:22.629 --> 15:26.133
who pledged his allegiance
to the United States.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.345
However, after being
given command

15:29.345 --> 15:31.804
of his own ship, the Betsy,

15:31.804 --> 15:35.725
he became a spy for
the British and fled the U.S.,

15:35.725 --> 15:38.979
taking his ship and the
valuable cargo it was carrying

15:38.979 --> 15:40.480
with him.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.067
Facing charges
of treason levied

15:43.067 --> 15:45.485
by then Governor of Virginia
Thomas Jefferson,

15:45.485 --> 15:48.447
Anderson escaped to Nova Scotia

15:48.447 --> 15:52.826
where he purchased Lot 26
on Oak Island.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.788
If this is a natural beach
or man-made,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.790
Mike West's metal detector
should be able

15:58.790 --> 16:01.125
to see deeper than
what your detector can

16:01.125 --> 16:03.211
and especially if
they were possibly

16:03.211 --> 16:05.047
-loading and unloading stuff.
-Yeah.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.506
Let's see what we can find.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

16:06.506 --> 16:08.174
MIKE W.:
All right. Let's get her going.

16:08.174 --> 16:10.469
-All right, mate,
we'll follow you.
-Okay.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.553
NARRATOR:
To assist them in their search,

16:12.553 --> 16:17.893
Mike will use a metal detecting
device known as the EM61.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.729
Unlike conventional
metal detectors,

16:20.729 --> 16:23.524
which are generally limited
to an average scanning depth

16:23.524 --> 16:28.403
of between one and three feet,
the EM61 is equipped

16:28.403 --> 16:31.115
with powerful transmitter
and receiver coils,

16:31.115 --> 16:33.450
allowing it
to sense metal objects

16:33.450 --> 16:36.620
buried up to 20 feet
deep underground.

16:36.620 --> 16:41.582
It also features a GPS device
which will allow the team

16:41.582 --> 16:43.711
to record the exact location

16:43.711 --> 16:47.380
of any targets too deep
to be dug up by hand.

16:50.717 --> 16:53.386
Come on, Mr. West.
Find us something good.

16:53.386 --> 16:56.056
I'll find something.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
(EM61 beeping)

17:00.269 --> 17:01.894
JACK:
You think he's got something?

17:03.438 --> 17:06.482
-Come get it.
-JACK: Yup. He found something.

17:06.482 --> 17:08.902
-Great.
-Is it a big or a little target?

17:08.902 --> 17:10.903
Real hard to tell.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.202
-JACK: Oh.
-GARY: You see it?

17:21.414 --> 17:23.415
JACK:
Oh, it's square.

17:23.415 --> 17:25.419
Oh, yeah, now that's an oldie.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.587
-Yeah, that looks old to me.
-Yeah.

17:27.587 --> 17:30.173
Yeah, that's a nice, old one.

17:30.173 --> 17:31.884
That's a 1700s spike.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.385
MIKE W.:
Purely 'cause it's square?

17:34.385 --> 17:37.806
Yeah, it's square and then with
the round flathead like that.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.476
That's textbook 1700s, this.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.685
Might even be older.

17:42.685 --> 17:46.440
If this was a wharf
or a landing or a boat slip,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.150
this is exactly
the type of thing

17:48.150 --> 17:50.277
you would expect
to find in the area.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.864
NARRATOR:
 A spike from a shipping wharf

17:53.864 --> 17:56.866
possibly dating back
to the 1700s?

17:56.866 --> 17:59.744
Could it have been part
of a dock or boat slip

17:59.744 --> 18:02.580
once used
by Captain James Anderson?

18:02.580 --> 18:05.125
This was in this area
used for something.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.796
-I'm pretty certain, but what?
-Mm-hmm.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.048
GARY:
Pretty cool.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.965
All right mate, I'll recheck it

18:12.965 --> 18:14.134
-and see if there's
anything else here.
-Sure. Yeah.

18:17.136 --> 18:19.096
(metal detector beeping)

18:19.096 --> 18:21.141
Nope. That was it.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.644
I'm gonna turn off and let you
bring that big, bad boy in.

18:27.522 --> 18:29.148
(EM61 beeping)

18:35.572 --> 18:38.741
JACK:
Find something, Mike?

18:38.741 --> 18:40.827
Yeah, it's small,
but I want to get a feel

18:40.827 --> 18:42.703
for what-what it could be.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.664
Yeah, there's a little piece
of iron here by the look of it.

18:44.664 --> 18:46.916
All right, Jack, just here.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.221
All right, let me see.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.973
I'll try and expose it.

19:01.973 --> 19:04.143
Look at that.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.978
-Wow.
-Oh.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.770
What is that?

19:12.608 --> 19:14.528
JACK:
 What is that?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.573
GARY:
All right, let's see.

19:20.867 --> 19:23.578
-Looks like a hook, doesn't it?
-JACK: Yeah.

19:23.578 --> 19:26.582
NARRATOR:
 While exploring Lot 26,

19:26.582 --> 19:28.875
located on the southwestern
beach of Oak Island,

19:28.875 --> 19:33.297
Jack Begley, along with metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

19:33.297 --> 19:36.758
and geophysicist Mike West,
have just found another

19:36.758 --> 19:40.136
potentially important artifact.

19:40.136 --> 19:43.390
I mean, hooks were used
for hooking sacks

19:43.390 --> 19:46.434
-and lifting stuff
off boats and onto boats.
-Oh.

19:46.434 --> 19:48.394
NARRATOR:
 A hook?

19:48.394 --> 19:51.981
Used for unloading cargo
from ships and found on land

19:51.981 --> 19:56.111
once owned by the 18th-century
pirate Captain James Anderson?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.988
Check this thing out.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.990
Last year, members
of the Oak Island team

20:00.990 --> 20:03.868
travelled to the home
of Steve Atkinson,

20:03.868 --> 20:05.913
a direct descendant
of James Anderson,

20:05.913 --> 20:08.957
where they were shown
one of the infamous buccaneer's

20:08.957 --> 20:10.791
actual sea chests.

20:10.791 --> 20:13.086
STEVE A.: That one opens
that treasure chest.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.839
In addition to the chest was
a ring of four mysterious keys.

20:16.839 --> 20:19.425
STEVE A.: Could there have been
more treasure chests

20:19.425 --> 20:21.260
on the island?
That's what I wonder.

20:21.260 --> 20:25.807
Could the hook that the team
has just found on Lot 26

20:25.807 --> 20:28.602
be evidence that
at least one of the legends

20:28.602 --> 20:30.895
concerning Captain James
Anderson is true?

20:30.895 --> 20:34.607
That he off-loaded a ship
filled with treasure

20:34.607 --> 20:37.944
and then placed it
in each of four chests,

20:37.944 --> 20:40.780
chests which he later buried
at various locations

20:40.780 --> 20:42.615
around Oak Island?

20:42.615 --> 20:45.493
-All right. That's good,
that's good.
-Okay.

20:45.493 --> 20:48.204
You got it?
That's off to a good start.

20:48.204 --> 20:50.999
-So I'll turn this off and wait
for your next target.
-Yeah.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.627
(EM61 beeping)

20:54.627 --> 20:58.339
NARRATOR: As another sun
 sets on Oak Island,

20:58.339 --> 21:02.134
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

21:02.134 --> 21:04.721
have called a meeting
in the war room.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.347
They are eager to share
with their team

21:06.347 --> 21:10.018
the incredible results
of the seismic testing

21:10.018 --> 21:12.104
that they received
earlier that day

21:12.104 --> 21:14.021
from the technicians
at Eagle Canada in Calgary.

21:14.021 --> 21:16.607
JACK:
Hey, Craig.

21:16.607 --> 21:19.193
-Hey, guys.
-MARTY: Hey, Craig.

21:19.193 --> 21:22.321
Okay, guys, I've got
the seismic maps here.

21:22.321 --> 21:24.907
Rick and Craig and I
have seen these results,

21:24.907 --> 21:26.993
um, you others haven't yet.

21:26.993 --> 21:29.037
So this is the mega-bin.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.248
Here's-here's
the Triton shaft, Dan.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.709
Oh, yeah.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.627
This is what they believe
is a cavity of some sort.

21:36.627 --> 21:38.672
This is only 50 feet deep.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.383
So that would be above
sea level, years ago.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.843
Yes.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.510
NARRATOR:
 Over the years,

21:44.510 --> 21:46.387
there have been many
Oak Island theorists

21:46.387 --> 21:50.182
who believe that the Money Pit
was constructed as a decoy,

21:50.182 --> 21:53.353
designed to thwart the efforts
of would-be searchers

21:53.353 --> 21:56.189
and keep them from finding
the actual treasure vault.

21:56.189 --> 22:00.359
It was their belief that,
after the Money Pit was dug

22:00.359 --> 22:02.863
and then booby-trapped
with sea water,

22:02.863 --> 22:06.032
another, more secret tunnel
was constructed,

22:06.032 --> 22:08.535
which branched off
from the fabled shaft

22:08.535 --> 22:10.244
and then lead
to a treasure vault

22:10.244 --> 22:12.705
located safely above sea level.

22:12.705 --> 22:15.959
I have always felt that
the theory proposed by others,

22:15.959 --> 22:18.461
that the Money Pit was dug
as deep as could be dug

22:18.461 --> 22:22.257
at the time and then
there is a-a tunnel

22:22.257 --> 22:24.718
that goes off from it somewhere,

22:24.718 --> 22:27.304
and at a relatively
shallow depth,

22:27.304 --> 22:29.221
that created
a chamber underground.

22:29.221 --> 22:31.391
And that makes so much sense

22:31.391 --> 22:34.227
because there would be
absolutely no way to find that

22:34.227 --> 22:36.229
with 300-year-old technology,

22:36.229 --> 22:38.065
unless you knew where it was.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.232
NARRATOR:
 Could the shallow anomaly,

22:40.232 --> 22:43.028
as indicated
on the 3-D seismic map

22:43.028 --> 22:46.280
and located some 600 feet north
of the Money Pit,

22:46.280 --> 22:49.951
be evidence that this
incredible theory is true?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.787
It's away from
searchers' excavations,

22:51.787 --> 22:54.288
pretty much guaranteed,
isn't it?

22:54.288 --> 22:55.915
-Yes.
-Nobody ever

22:55.915 --> 22:57.541
really did much there.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.752
Right.

22:59.752 --> 23:04.340
Um, this is H-8 and that's C-1.

23:04.340 --> 23:06.384
Well, what's this
spot right there?

23:06.384 --> 23:09.261
MARTY: They think
that's another chamber.

23:09.261 --> 23:10.638
This is so dramatically

23:10.638 --> 23:12.641
different than
the rest of the stuff.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.853
What's this one taken at, Craig?
That roughly corresponds to 160?

23:16.853 --> 23:18.814
Yes, about there.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.148
That's really the area
that I'm expecting

23:21.148 --> 23:24.944
serious originators work
is below 160 feet

23:24.944 --> 23:26.238
in the limestone, so...

23:26.238 --> 23:27.823
CRAIG:
We also have the other map

23:27.823 --> 23:30.784
that kind of shows potential
tunnels around 100 feet.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.162
MARTY: So we have
a rather simple task today.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.123
We're gonna pick where
we're gonna do the core holes.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.582
I think we should
pick the locations

23:37.582 --> 23:38.875
and then I think
we should prioritize them..

23:38.875 --> 23:40.460
I agree.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.461
MARTY:
So that is an obvious target.

23:42.461 --> 23:43.963
There's one core hole for sure.

23:43.963 --> 23:45.423
Mm-hmm.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.299
I can pick a couple locations
that can hit

23:47.299 --> 23:49.385
both the tunnel at 100 feet

23:49.385 --> 23:53.013
and this deeper chamber,
you know, in the Money Pit area.

23:53.013 --> 23:54.516
-MARTY: Okay.
-So I got two locations,
potentially.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.351
MARTY:
All right.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.604
-I would like to go here first.
-I agree.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.605
Okay.

24:01.605 --> 24:03.817
MARTY: Based on these results,
 this will very accurately,

24:03.817 --> 24:07.194
precisely, locate
a core hole location

24:07.194 --> 24:09.029
and we'll try
and core this anomaly.

24:09.029 --> 24:11.324
I mean, it's a
simple strategy, right?

24:11.324 --> 24:13.034
Find something in the Money Pit.

24:13.034 --> 24:16.371
MARTY: I just can't wait
to put the real-world test

24:16.371 --> 24:17.998
to their interpretations.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.457
-Yes.
-MARTY: All right,

24:19.457 --> 24:21.500
I think we're done here.
Uh, this is great.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.170
Um, it's gonna be
real interesting.

24:23.170 --> 24:26.381
So thanks, Craig.
I think we're all set.

24:26.381 --> 24:33.680
-RICK: See you, Craig.
-CRAIG: See you, guys.
-MARTY: See you.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.932
NARRATOR:
 The next morning,

24:35.932 --> 24:38.018
as the team waits
for drilling equipment

24:38.018 --> 24:39.810
to arrive on Oak Island,

24:39.810 --> 24:44.481
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
head to Smith's Cove,

24:44.481 --> 24:47.193
where the team from
Irving Equipment Limited

24:47.193 --> 24:49.028
has now begun the construction

24:49.028 --> 24:51.530
of the massive steel cofferdam.

24:51.530 --> 24:54.284
Look at that.
It's actually up in the air.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.619
MARTY:
It's a good day, Rick.

24:56.619 --> 24:59.372
Over there, look at all that
sheet piling stacked up there.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.874
RICK:
Look at that.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.837
Well... (chuckles)

25:06.837 --> 25:09.673
Michel, how are you?

25:09.673 --> 25:11.718
-How you doing? How you doing?
-Good, good, good.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.553
-This year, right?
-Oh, yeah, this year.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.721
Quite impressive.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.144
How long do you think
it would take

25:21.144 --> 25:22.811
to do that section right there?

25:22.811 --> 25:24.314
COLIN: If everything goes good,
I think we'll be done--

25:24.314 --> 25:26.566
we'll have the sheets
in a couple days.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.859
MARTY: It's gonna be
a massive undertaking

25:28.859 --> 25:31.403
-for us to dig behind it.
-MICHEL: Yeah, exactly.

25:31.403 --> 25:33.155
RICK: We believe there's
something in the Money Pit,

25:33.155 --> 25:34.574
but here, we know
there's something.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.242
That U-shaped structure
is definitely there

25:36.242 --> 25:37.535
and we want to expose it.

25:37.535 --> 25:40.079
-Yeah.
-RICK: So we have a hard target.

25:40.079 --> 25:44.250
-And maybe some artifacts.
-And maybe some artifacts.

25:44.250 --> 25:47.253
NARRATOR:
 In the early 1970s,

25:47.253 --> 25:50.089
Oak Island treasure hunter
Dan Blankenship

25:50.089 --> 25:52.759
made his own attempt
to excavate Smith's Cove

25:52.759 --> 25:55.971
and locate the flood tunnels,
which he hoped would lead him

25:55.971 --> 25:58.682
directly to the fabled
treasure vault.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.559
Like the Laginas, he
constructed a large cofferdam

26:02.559 --> 26:04.229
around Smith's Cove,

26:04.229 --> 26:07.941
made of large boulders
packed with earth.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.278
Unfortunately, harsh weather
plagued his efforts,

26:11.278 --> 26:13.779
and before he could locate
the flood tunnels,

26:13.779 --> 26:16.449
Dan's cofferdam
was washed away,

26:16.449 --> 26:20.744
but not before he made
an amazing discovery.

26:20.744 --> 26:25.083
Located just off shore,
and some ten feet underground,

26:25.083 --> 26:28.961
Dan found the remains of
an elaborate wooden structure.

26:28.961 --> 26:31.047
Because of its unique shape,

26:31.047 --> 26:33.799
Dan dubbed it
"the U-shaped structure,"

26:33.799 --> 26:35.634
although its intended purpose,

26:35.634 --> 26:38.471
as well as the identities
of those who constructed it,

26:38.471 --> 26:41.557
have remained a mystery.

26:41.557 --> 26:45.436
The hope is that, because of
the type of construction,

26:45.436 --> 26:48.105
we can get it quite dry,

26:48.105 --> 26:52.318
and that's the only way to do
a very disciplined dig

26:52.318 --> 26:55.488
and to expose the U-shaped
structure in its entirety,

26:55.488 --> 26:58.782
and if we track one
of the French drains back,

26:58.782 --> 27:01.076
we find the
flood tunnel system,

27:01.076 --> 27:03.997
we find exactly where
the Money Pit is.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.082
All right, well,

27:06.082 --> 27:07.584
I don't want to hold
these guys up.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.169
Let's get 'er done.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.171
RICK:
It's gonna be interesting.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.266
NARRATOR:
 Later that day, as work

27:23.266 --> 27:25.434
continues at Smith's Cove,

27:25.434 --> 27:28.688
Rick Lagina, along with
his nephew, Peter Fornetti,

27:28.688 --> 27:31.106
Craig Tester, and other members
of their team,

27:31.106 --> 27:33.777
gather at the Oak Island
visitor's center.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.612
-Hi, are you Brennan?
-I'm Brennan.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.779
-Craig Tester.
-Nice to meet you, Craig.

27:36.779 --> 27:38.239
-Finally.
-Nice to meet you.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.949
NARRATOR:
 They have scheduled a meeting

27:39.949 --> 27:42.035
with representatives
of Choice Drilling,

27:42.035 --> 27:44.537
a company that specializes
in a process

27:44.537 --> 27:47.374
known as sonic drilling.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.375
So that's the rig?

27:49.375 --> 27:51.126
This is the rig.

27:51.126 --> 27:55.048
NARRATOR: Unlike regular air
 or mud rotary drilling,

27:55.048 --> 27:56.965
which uses powerful drill bits

27:56.965 --> 27:59.551
to literally grind
beneath the ground,

27:59.551 --> 28:02.262
sonic drilling uses vibrations

28:02.262 --> 28:04.182
to create a high
frequency sound,

28:04.182 --> 28:07.559
which can literally
pulverize obstacles.

28:07.559 --> 28:11.021
A coring barrel is then used
to extract samples

28:11.021 --> 28:13.066
of earth and objects from areas

28:13.066 --> 28:16.236
as much as 500 feet deep.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.323
RICK: I think we all
are quite curious how

28:20.323 --> 28:22.700
this-this rig works.
We've never seen one before.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.827
-She'll be a treat for you.
-RICK: Well, we've got some

28:24.827 --> 28:27.538
real targets for you, we'll see.

28:27.538 --> 28:28.748
Well, I'm eager
for the challenge.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.084
-It is Oak Island.
-It is.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.127
CRAIG: Let's head on back,
let you guys get set up.

28:33.127 --> 28:34.421
-Sounds good.
-All right,
super exciting, guys.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.005
Good luck.

28:42.095 --> 28:46.432
RICK: I've always been
 against just guessing.

28:46.432 --> 28:50.019
I mean, the whole point of
the seismic program was to find

28:50.019 --> 28:54.273
anomalous features underground
in the Money Pit.

28:54.273 --> 28:56.567
Well, they targeted an area
that's worth investigating,

28:56.567 --> 28:58.778
and thus,
we're gonna drill there.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.571
If we can't get excited
about that,

29:00.571 --> 29:01.990
it's time to go home.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.243
What we're gonna just do is,

29:06.243 --> 29:07.369
we're gonna take
that water truck

29:07.369 --> 29:09.622
and I'll just park it over here.

29:09.622 --> 29:12.875
NARRATOR: Assisting the team
 with their drilling operation

29:12.875 --> 29:16.003
is area geologist
Terry Matheson.

29:16.003 --> 29:20.258
Okay, so the surveyors
put in the D-line, D2 to D6,

29:20.258 --> 29:22.634
so there's our spot.

29:22.634 --> 29:26.931
So it's halfway between D and E?
Right on line six,

29:26.931 --> 29:29.933
-so DE-6.
-TERRY: DE-6 it is.

29:29.933 --> 29:32.144
NARRATOR:
 Using last year's

29:32.144 --> 29:35.731
Geotech grid as a reference,
the team has decided to dig

29:35.731 --> 29:39.318
their first hole at a location
known as DE-6.

29:39.318 --> 29:42.113
Here, they hope to find

29:42.113 --> 29:46.159
not only a possible system
of tunnels some 100 feet deep

29:46.159 --> 29:48.869
but also a 30-foot-wide chamber

29:48.869 --> 29:53.290
at a depth of approximately
170 feet.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.417
It is also in this chamber

29:55.417 --> 29:57.252
that the team hopes
it will locate

29:57.252 --> 29:59.422
the mysterious Chappell Vault,

29:59.422 --> 30:02.174
in which bits of gold
and a piece of parchment

30:02.174 --> 30:05.010
were recovered
more than a century ago,

30:05.010 --> 30:09.015
shortly before it sank
further beneath the ground.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.893
So, what's the target depth
on this one?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.310
Seismic anomaly,

30:13.310 --> 30:16.355
he's thinking 100 feet to 185,

30:16.355 --> 30:19.526
so it'll go to at least 185,
and maybe deeper.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.277
-All right, let's find out.
-TERRY: This could be the one.

30:26.615 --> 30:29.661
NARRATOR: After coring
 and collecting samples

30:29.661 --> 30:32.079
at intervals of up to ten feet,

30:32.079 --> 30:34.332
the samples will then
be transferred

30:34.332 --> 30:37.042
into plastic sleeves
for thorough inspection

30:37.042 --> 30:39.295
of any potential artifacts
or treasure.

30:41.713 --> 30:43.883
-CRAIG:
What depth did you get to?
-MIKE T.: 75.

30:43.883 --> 30:46.134
So, it looks like
we're at 75 feet

30:46.134 --> 30:47.929
at the bottom
of the last sample.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.472
Target depth is about 90
or a 100, I think.

30:50.472 --> 30:53.559
The elevation's changed so much
with all the digging,

30:53.559 --> 30:54.894
we-we want to start
looking early.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.186
-Yeah.
-I'd say about 90.

30:56.186 --> 30:57.896
Sure. So, we got to start,
you know,

30:57.896 --> 30:59.566
looking very closely
at all this stuff.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.701
Yup, there it goes.

31:10.701 --> 31:12.662
TERRY:
It went through?

31:12.662 --> 31:15.582
-Yeah, it went real fast.
-Excellent.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.960
BRENNAN:
Well, who knows what this is.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.048
All right.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.260
-Take the bit right over.
-If it comes out.

31:31.597 --> 31:33.682
Bring it on over.

31:33.682 --> 31:36.102
There's your wood.

31:36.102 --> 31:39.771
MIKE T.:
That's, uh, 83...

31:39.771 --> 31:40.940
-or 93, sorry.
-It's 93.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.192
-93.
-93. Wow.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.652
That's interesting.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.445
And that...
the way it's cut...

31:46.445 --> 31:48.865
-I love it.
-It was laying this way.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.616
-Yeah.
-Not standing up.

31:50.616 --> 31:52.242
It was laying like this,
so it could be

31:52.242 --> 31:54.621
the top of a... a tunnel.

31:59.625 --> 32:01.501
CRAIG:
 Could be the top of a tunnel.

32:01.501 --> 32:04.130
-Wow!
-NARRATOR: While examining
 spoils excavated

32:04.130 --> 32:06.798
from borehole DE-6
at the Money Pit,

32:06.798 --> 32:09.594
Oak Island partner Craig Tester

32:09.594 --> 32:12.137
and geologist Terry Matheson

32:12.137 --> 32:13.472
have just made
what they believe

32:13.472 --> 32:16.643
could be an important
discovery.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.435
CRAIG:
Definitely more wood.

32:18.435 --> 32:20.313
TERRY:
Certainly very interesting.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.815
CRAIG: Yeah, I like the fact
that it's laying horizontal

32:22.815 --> 32:26.068
-so it looks to me
like a tunnel.
-Yeah. Yeah.

32:26.068 --> 32:28.738
NARRATOR:
 Wood? From a tunnel?

32:28.738 --> 32:30.656
But from what period?

32:30.656 --> 32:33.034
Could it be little more
than the remains

32:33.034 --> 32:35.577
of a searcher tunnel--
one of the dozens

32:35.577 --> 32:38.330
that have been dug
on the island over the years?

32:38.330 --> 32:41.041
Or could it be
physical evidence

32:41.041 --> 32:43.502
from an original
underground structure,

32:43.502 --> 32:46.088
one that may have been
put there centuries ago

32:46.088 --> 32:48.340
by the people
who came to the island

32:48.340 --> 32:50.676
looking to hide
an incredible treasure?

32:50.676 --> 32:53.346
We're-we're looking
for open tunnels,

32:53.346 --> 32:56.848
and-and, to me, um, what's
at the bottom of that tunnel?

32:56.848 --> 32:59.644
Is there something down there
that-that man left there

32:59.644 --> 33:01.979
that we can identify
and say, hey,

33:01.979 --> 33:04.731
this is the original tunnel?

33:04.731 --> 33:08.403
So let's see what's
on the bottom of that tunnel.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.529
-Or vault.
-Or a vault.

33:10.529 --> 33:12.365
Here's hoping, yeah.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.415
What's the depth of this, Mike?

33:21.415 --> 33:24.961
-Uh, 96.
-96.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.880
TERRY: Okay. So, we got s...
we got quite some serious

33:27.880 --> 33:29.882
-minced-up wood there.
-CRAIG: Yeah.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.509
-TERRY: It's pretty interesting.
-It is.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.138
Gentlemen.

33:36.138 --> 33:38.182
-TERRY: Hey, guys.
-Hi.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.558
-Wow.
-Look what we got.

33:39.558 --> 33:42.228
This is what
we came into at 93 feet.

33:42.228 --> 33:45.355
This was
the very top of it, here.

33:45.355 --> 33:47.232
And it was all nice
and horizontal.

33:47.232 --> 33:50.361
You can see where the bit was,
cutting right through like that.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.405
We came right
out of the material

33:53.405 --> 33:55.074
into a horizontal beam,

33:55.074 --> 33:58.035
so it sure looks like
it's-it's a tunnel.

33:58.035 --> 34:00.078
But then, when they drilled,

34:00.078 --> 34:01.913
they only drilled
three more feet,

34:01.913 --> 34:03.750
and the last foot
is back into solid clay,

34:03.750 --> 34:06.919
so it's... there's
a very limited interval

34:06.919 --> 34:08.963
where true wood came from.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.047
-So it almost has
to be collapsed.
-CHARLES: A collapsed tunnel?

34:11.047 --> 34:13.259
TERRY: Yeah, you would
think collapsed, yeah.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.552
CHARLES: Craig, does this match
up with the seismic anomaly

34:15.552 --> 34:17.137
-that we saw?
-CRAIG: Yeah. This is the heart

34:17.137 --> 34:18.931
of that anomaly,
right where we're drilling.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.851
We're there.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.936
A tunnel could be there.

34:24.936 --> 34:26.355
It could have been
one of the other tunnels

34:26.355 --> 34:27.690
coming off the Money Pit.

34:29.942 --> 34:33.112
We've encountered a...
what we believe to be a tunnel

34:33.112 --> 34:36.157
in an area
where we have a target

34:36.157 --> 34:39.409
based on the seismic data, but
we don't know what that means.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.788
It could be original work.

34:41.788 --> 34:45.458
We don't know, and that's what
we're trying to decipher.

34:45.458 --> 34:49.295
It's exciting. It-it can't
be just a coincidence.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.090
-Definitely get this
carbon dated.
-Yeah.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.092
If it comes back
really, really old,

34:55.092 --> 34:56.427
-then we know
it's original people.
-Absolutely.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.471
Exactly.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.431
NARRATOR: The discovery
 of a possible tunnel

35:01.431 --> 35:03.309
directly connected
to the Money Pit

35:03.309 --> 35:05.853
offers exciting news
for the Laginas

35:05.853 --> 35:08.105
and members of their team.

35:08.105 --> 35:12.193
It means that the seismic data
they received from Eagle Canada

35:12.193 --> 35:15.153
was able to accurately pinpoint
the existence of a structure

35:15.153 --> 35:19.826
located some 93 feet
below ground.

35:19.826 --> 35:24.496
It also means that as they
continue to drill down deeper,

35:24.496 --> 35:26.498
the team may also be successful

35:26.498 --> 35:29.960
at finding another
critically important chamber,

35:29.960 --> 35:31.795
the one which they believe

35:31.795 --> 35:35.173
might contain
the legendary Chappell Vault.

35:36.842 --> 35:39.846
Is this interesting?
Absolutely.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.681
You know, it mandates
that we continue,

35:41.681 --> 35:43.474
and we're gonna
continue the process,

35:43.474 --> 35:45.518
get down to where the anomaly
is featured.

35:45.518 --> 35:48.186
-CRAIG: Yeah.
-CHARLES: Exactly.

35:48.186 --> 35:51.440
NARRATOR: As the sonic drilling
 operation continues

35:51.440 --> 35:53.400
in the Money Pit area,

35:53.400 --> 35:56.027
Jack Begley, Gary Drayton

35:56.027 --> 35:59.865
and Mike West return to Lot 26,

35:59.865 --> 36:01.867
property that was once owned

36:01.867 --> 36:04.871
by the 18th-century pirate
and privateer

36:04.871 --> 36:06.496
Captain James Anderson.

36:06.496 --> 36:08.456
(beeping)

36:14.422 --> 36:16.882
GARY: I think Mike's
got another signal.

36:16.882 --> 36:19.342
Any idea of the size of it?

36:19.342 --> 36:21.137
Yeah, something here,
it's quite small.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.722
But in this area here, where
I just kicked off a little bit.

36:23.722 --> 36:26.516
GARY:
Yeah, I'm getting it.

36:26.516 --> 36:29.519
It's only reading
four or five inches.

36:29.519 --> 36:32.231
What? All right,
that makes it easy.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.362
-JACK: You want to check?
-GARY: All right, mate-- yep.

36:39.362 --> 36:40.864
JACK:
Oh, it's out! It's right there.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.909
GARY: I see it, yeah.
Yep, I see it.

36:43.909 --> 36:45.911
JACK:
What is it?

36:45.911 --> 36:47.538
GARY:
Yeah, look at that.

36:49.623 --> 36:51.166
JACK:
A welding rod?

36:51.166 --> 36:54.420
-No. Look at this.
-No?

36:54.420 --> 36:56.088
Oh, shoot.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.425
GARY:
 Unbelievable!

37:01.344 --> 37:05.097
NARRATOR: While searching
 for artifacts on Lot 26,

37:05.097 --> 37:07.099
located on the island's
southwest shore,

37:07.099 --> 37:09.809
Jack Begley, Mike West

37:09.809 --> 37:11.938
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

37:11.938 --> 37:14.940
have just made
a curious discovery.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.275
GARY:
That looks like a bleedin' bolt.

37:17.275 --> 37:20.445
-Wow! That looks
like a crossbolt.
-(laughs): Yeah.

37:20.445 --> 37:22.697
-JACK: Totally.
-NARRATOR: A crossbow bolt?

37:22.697 --> 37:25.617
On Oak Island? But how
did such an unusual object

37:25.617 --> 37:28.119
come to be in Nova Scotia?

37:28.119 --> 37:30.664
And, perhaps
even more important,

37:30.664 --> 37:33.041
who brought it here?

37:33.041 --> 37:35.293
That is sweet.

37:35.293 --> 37:38.713
I mean, this is old. We're
talking, like, Templar old.

37:38.713 --> 37:41.634
-No!
-Yeah, that's when
they used them.

37:41.634 --> 37:45.972
That could be anywhere
from a 1000 to 1500.

37:47.472 --> 37:49.182
NARRATOR:
 Dating back to as early

37:49.182 --> 37:51.018
as the 7th century BC,

37:51.018 --> 37:55.188
the crossbow was
a powerful long-ranged weapon

37:55.188 --> 37:57.650
favored for its accuracy
and ability

37:57.650 --> 38:00.568
to pierce through heavy armor.

38:00.568 --> 38:04.364
They were also widely used
by individuals of high status

38:04.364 --> 38:07.492
throughout the militaries
of Medieval Europe

38:07.492 --> 38:09.829
until they were replaced
in the 16th century

38:09.829 --> 38:13.123
by gunpowder-based firearms.

38:13.123 --> 38:17.210
Could what Gary has identified
as a possible crossbow bolt

38:17.210 --> 38:20.213
really be evidence that members
of the Knights Templar

38:20.213 --> 38:23.509
visited Oak Island
centuries ago?

38:23.509 --> 38:26.344
Let's give Rick a call.

38:26.344 --> 38:29.974
-He's gonna be excited.
-He's gonna flip out
when he sees.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.684
(line ringing)

38:31.684 --> 38:34.353
If this is a crossbow bolt--
which it looks like it is--

38:34.353 --> 38:36.355
this was a weapon.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.858
And by the time people started
colonizing Nova Scotia,

38:39.858 --> 38:42.777
crossbows had, like,
really gotten out of use.

38:42.777 --> 38:45.364
People were using muskets
and other firearms.

38:45.364 --> 38:49.201
So an object this out of place
on Oak Island

38:49.201 --> 38:51.369
could be a really,
really big find.

38:51.369 --> 38:53.204
RICK:
Hey, Gary.

38:53.204 --> 38:55.623
GARY: Well, we'll show you
what we've been up to.

39:00.588 --> 39:04.382
A weapon, or a crossbow bolt.

39:04.382 --> 39:06.092
-Yeah. Exactly.
-Yup. (chuckling)

39:06.092 --> 39:09.554
Crossbolt or arrow,
but I think that's a crossbolt.

39:09.554 --> 39:12.057
And if that's a crossbolt,

39:12.057 --> 39:16.228
that is very, very, very old.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.731
And something like this
would have been used

39:18.731 --> 39:21.900
for piercing chain mail.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.277
Templar, baby.

39:24.277 --> 39:26.072
I'm using the "T" word.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.907
(laughter)

39:27.907 --> 39:30.451
I think we were all blown away

39:30.451 --> 39:32.244
by the potential crossbow bolt.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.789
Gary is saying
it's very, very, very old.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.456
And this type of crossbow bolt

39:36.456 --> 39:38.416
was meant
to penetrate chain mail.

39:38.416 --> 39:40.376
Well, chain mail is Medieval.

39:40.376 --> 39:43.005
So it's possible
that it might go back

39:43.005 --> 39:46.842
perhaps to the 12 or 1300s,
perhaps even earlier.

39:46.842 --> 39:50.137
So it's an exciting find.
There's no question about it.

39:50.137 --> 39:52.681
I mean, that is fantastic.
Crossbolt.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.934
You guys are smiling now.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.936
We knew you would like this.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.896
That is cool.
That is-that is cool.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.108
This shape might be
culture-influenced,

40:02.108 --> 40:05.777
some way to define
where it came from.

40:05.777 --> 40:09.614
Laird and-or Kelly Bourassa
would know something about this.

40:09.614 --> 40:13.159
But you're right, that's-that's
the find, right there.

40:13.159 --> 40:15.788
-JACK: And it's exciting.
-RICK: It is.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.164
And, well, I don't know
which is more exciting, this,

40:18.164 --> 40:20.793
or what yet remains to be found
in the Money Pit.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.795
But it's all about now,

40:22.795 --> 40:26.965
continuing to search
and do research.

40:26.965 --> 40:29.300
I feel like we just scratched
the surface of this area.

40:29.300 --> 40:32.346
RICK: I can't say anything
but thanks for all your efforts.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.056
Great day, you know?
Great day.

40:39.018 --> 40:42.148
NARRATOR: Following a week
 of intriguing revelations

40:42.148 --> 40:44.608
and exciting, new discoveries,

40:44.608 --> 40:48.737
Rick, Marty, and the Oak Island
team are convinced

40:48.737 --> 40:50.822
that they are closer than ever
to solving

40:50.822 --> 40:54.326
this 223-year-old mystery.

40:54.326 --> 40:57.163
But as they continue
to drill deeper

40:57.163 --> 41:00.833
towards what they hope is
a centuries-old treasure vault,

41:00.833 --> 41:02.376
what will they find?

41:02.376 --> 41:05.003
Millions in gold and jewels,

41:05.003 --> 41:08.047
stolen by pirates
on the high seas?

41:08.047 --> 41:11.092
Priceless religious artifacts?

41:11.092 --> 41:14.889
Or will they discover
that the Oak Island treasure

41:14.889 --> 41:17.766
is so well-protected
that the price

41:17.766 --> 41:20.226
they will be forced to pay
in order to retrieve it

41:20.226 --> 41:24.731
will not be measured
in dollars, but in lives?

41:29.027 --> 41:32.030
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:32.030 --> 41:34.032
RICK: We know we have a target.
 The Money Pit.

41:34.032 --> 41:35.576
CRAIG: Fingers crossed,
 we hit the vault.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.369
RICK:
All it would take is one little

41:37.369 --> 41:39.204
obscure piece of paper
to make it all worth it.

41:39.204 --> 41:41.248
-Here it is.
-Oh!

41:41.248 --> 41:43.583
RICK: We're on something
really, really hard.

41:43.583 --> 41:46.045
Could this be the "aha" moment?

41:46.045 --> 41:47.755
-We have another sample for you.
-Let's have a look at it.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.882
MARTY: We need to run
 composition analysis on it.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.382
Okay.

41:51.382 --> 41:54.177
-MARTY: Wow.
-It appears to be Roman.

41:54.177 --> 41:55.429
-Wow.
-No way!

41:55.429 --> 41:57.556
-Roman, baby.
-(laughing)
