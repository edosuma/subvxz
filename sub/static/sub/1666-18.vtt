WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:01.818
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.819 --> 00:04.673
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

00:04.674 --> 00:06.795
The city grew accustomed
to having a King.

00:06.796 --> 00:08.114
You wanted this throne.

00:08.115 --> 00:10.016
If you won't do anything, I will.

00:10.017 --> 00:13.764
Kieran's the only family I have left.
I'm tired of being alone.

00:15.653 --> 00:19.349
You're supposed to be a harvest girl,
but maybe you don't belong here.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.856
A battle is brewing, T.

00:20.857 --> 00:22.356
While everyone's busy choosing sides,

00:22.357 --> 00:24.605
I'm gonna find a way
to take back our city.

00:24.606 --> 00:26.607
Daylight rings shield
vampires from the sun,

00:26.608 --> 00:30.705
so why not a moonlight ring to
protect werewolves from the curse?

00:30.706 --> 00:32.406
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?

00:32.406 --> 00:35.032
We could finally control what we are.

00:35.033 --> 00:37.611
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

00:37.612 --> 00:39.282
the vampires who hate us,

00:39.283 --> 00:42.789
we wouldn't just be their equals.
We'd be their superiors.

00:49.572 --> 00:51.982
You're up early.

00:51.983 --> 00:54.482
After the night we had,
I expected you to sleep in.

00:55.026 --> 00:58.350
Yes, well, morning sun
offers the best light.

01:00.702 --> 01:01.770
Hold still.

01:02.907 --> 01:04.307
I'm almost finished.

01:06.848 --> 01:10.526
In my last life, I was far too
modest if I was in the nude.

01:10.527 --> 01:12.632
Well, then consider
yourself much improved.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.301
Modesty is for the weak.

01:22.970 --> 01:25.332
Well, are you gonna show me?

01:25.333 --> 01:27.521
The painting is a gift.

01:27.522 --> 01:32.050
A token to honor our pact.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.369
Our pact?

01:34.370 --> 01:35.636
We had such a lovely night

01:35.637 --> 01:37.886
and now I see it was
all a means to an end.

01:37.887 --> 01:42.449
A rather delicious means to
a mutually beneficial end.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.922
Tell me.
Beyond the pleasures of last night

01:44.923 --> 01:48.158
and the promise of what I'm
sure is an exquisite painting,

01:48.159 --> 01:50.196
what exactly would
a french quarter witch gain

01:50.197 --> 01:52.001
from aligning with you?

01:52.002 --> 01:54.641
Well, the treaty my
dear brother negotiated

01:54.642 --> 01:56.905
between the warring
factions of this city,

01:56.906 --> 01:58.577
the one that you yourself signed.

02:00.446 --> 02:03.385
No doubt everyone means well,
but this is after all...

02:03.386 --> 02:04.958
Still the french quarter?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.863
A borough rife with natural enemies.

02:08.864 --> 02:14.771
What you and your witches need is
the protection only I can provide.

02:14.772 --> 02:16.758
No one... not vampires,
not werewolves,

02:16.759 --> 02:20.599
not even my brother will dare trifle
with you if I am on your side.

02:22.017 --> 02:26.856
And in exchange...
I am to offer you what, exactly?

02:29.161 --> 02:33.442
All I ask is for
the promise of your allegiance.

02:33.443 --> 02:37.941
One never knows when a powerful
witch might come in handy.

02:38.711 --> 02:40.532
Well, then.

02:59.692 --> 03:00.972
Aah!

03:03.616 --> 03:09.625
Sine la quatrieme puella leve,
comme Genevieve ceciderit.

03:09.626 --> 03:15.097
Sine la quatrieme puella
leve, comme Genevieve ceciderit.

03:16.500 --> 03:21.698
Monique, are you ok? Monique, you
sounded like you were possessed.

03:21.699 --> 03:23.742
I wasn't possessed.

03:23.743 --> 03:26.078
I was channeling the ancestors.

03:26.079 --> 03:28.458
They say it's time to
complete the reaping.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.918
To do that, the fourth harvest
girl must be resurrected,

03:32.919 --> 03:37.031
which means... it's time
for Genevieve to die.

03:48.741 --> 03:50.852
Enough with all the racket!

03:50.853 --> 03:52.682
Is there a problem, brother?

03:52.683 --> 03:54.398
Gentlemen, please.

03:54.399 --> 03:58.694
I agreed to a general sprucing
up, not a bloody 3-ring circus.

03:58.695 --> 04:00.627
Marcel and his minions abused our home

04:00.628 --> 04:02.496
for the better part of a century.

04:02.497 --> 04:05.117
Now, you might be content
to live in squalor. I'm not.

04:05.118 --> 04:06.800
I agree with your brother.

04:06.801 --> 04:08.937
It's a new era in the french quarter.

04:08.938 --> 04:11.043
This place could use a makeover.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.478
Careful, Elijah.

04:12.479 --> 04:17.216
When this one agrees with you, it's
a sure sign she wants something.

04:17.218 --> 04:21.007
Actually... I do
have a request.

04:21.009 --> 04:23.496
I'm told our coven hasn't been
able to celebrate feast days

04:23.497 --> 04:26.730
in the open since Marcel
restricted the use of magic.

04:26.731 --> 04:29.700
Now with the new peace,
I'd like that to change.

04:29.701 --> 04:32.639
Am I to assume that you have
a certain feast day in mind?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.397
The fete des benedictions.

04:35.398 --> 04:37.482
Feast of the blessings.
In the past,

04:37.483 --> 04:39.580
members of the community
offered witches gifts

04:39.581 --> 04:41.049
in exchange for blessings.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.552
We'd like to use it as a forum

04:42.553 --> 04:45.488
for introducing our young
harvest girls to society.

04:45.489 --> 04:47.617
So your coven attempted
to destroy my family

04:47.618 --> 04:51.425
and you yourself held my
siblings in unspeakable torment.

04:51.426 --> 04:53.832
And you would like
a party for the witches.

04:56.419 --> 04:58.256
I made my amends with your brother.

05:01.273 --> 05:02.775
Why don't you think it over?

05:05.714 --> 05:07.951
Oh, don't be such a stiff, Elijah.

05:07.952 --> 05:09.931
The tourists love a good festival.

05:09.932 --> 05:11.885
Besides, what better way
to cement the solidarity

05:11.886 --> 05:14.561
than a show of faith
toward a onetime enemy?

05:14.562 --> 05:19.107
A onetime enemy with whom you've
grown rather nauseatingly intimate.

05:19.108 --> 05:22.319
Who said maintaining
alliances can't be fun?

05:22.320 --> 05:24.802
One would think you'd
be a little more interested

05:24.803 --> 05:27.741
in attending to the needs of
the mother of your child.

05:27.742 --> 05:32.496
So she's the reason behind this
oh-so-thoughtful renovation.

05:32.497 --> 05:35.317
Elijah, the truth is the mother
of my child is werewolf royalty.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.120
She's far safer in
the bayou with her pack

05:37.121 --> 05:38.922
than she would ever be here with us.

05:40.478 --> 05:44.156
Don't worry. I'll bring her
home before the birth.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.825
No child of mine
will be born in a swamp.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.059
You've gotta be kidding me.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.515
Seriously, what is going on?

05:51.516 --> 05:52.927
Who are all these people?

05:52.928 --> 05:56.164
Why are they standing out
here all weird and lurky?

05:56.165 --> 05:58.647
They've come from all over.
All the packs.

05:58.648 --> 06:01.775
Why? To see a baby
that isn't even born yet?

06:01.776 --> 06:05.946
Forget the baby. These freaks,
they come here to see you.

06:05.947 --> 06:07.304
You know, given
the place your parents

06:07.305 --> 06:09.042
held in pack hierarchy,
maybe they think

06:09.043 --> 06:12.577
you're gonna be the long-lost
werewolf messiah or something.

06:12.578 --> 06:15.831
Great. No pressure or anything.

06:18.944 --> 06:20.012
Hello?

06:20.013 --> 06:22.981
Oliver. I trust you have an update
on the matter we discussed.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.984
Yeah, um...
About that.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.185
We got wolves coming in
by the truckload right now,

06:28.186 --> 06:30.521
so it's gonna be a little
tricky to find us one guy.

06:30.522 --> 06:32.156
I mean, all you gave me
was a first name.

06:32.157 --> 06:33.351
Yes. His name is Cary.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.184
He's got blond hair and blue eyes.

06:36.185 --> 06:38.196
He's one of my clan...
A distant relative

06:38.197 --> 06:40.105
from the northeast Atlantic pack.

06:40.106 --> 06:43.733
His presence is required if
we are to continue with our plan.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.801
You find him and you bring him to me.

06:46.703 --> 06:48.036
All right, fine.
I'm on it.

06:48.037 --> 06:50.470
Another thing... my brother
will soon invite you

06:50.471 --> 06:52.540
to a feast honoring the witches.

06:52.541 --> 06:56.246
You and your friends will
graciously accept the invitation.

06:56.247 --> 06:58.457
Why the hell would I do that?

06:58.458 --> 07:00.448
Because if Elijah believes
his treaty is working,

07:00.449 --> 07:02.183
he'll be less inclined
to get in my way.

07:13.197 --> 07:14.364
What do you want?

07:14.365 --> 07:18.059
I formed an alliance with someone
who may be able to help your uncle.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.572
Let me guess.
Tall, redhead, axe to grind?

07:21.573 --> 07:23.175
Those resurrected witches
are the ones who

07:23.176 --> 07:24.210
hexed Kieran in the first place.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.775
Why would she want to help?

07:25.776 --> 07:28.114
Because it's my decree that she does.

07:30.337 --> 07:33.408
I believe the words you're
looking for are "thank you."

07:33.409 --> 07:36.921
By all means, say no if
you have an alternative.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.895
No.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.678
Wait.

07:53.609 --> 07:54.711
Do whatever you have to do.

07:54.712 --> 07:56.244
Just help him.

08:03.356 --> 08:05.724
You wanted me to
keep an eye on Klaus. I did.

08:05.725 --> 08:07.026
If you ask me, this is a good thing.

08:07.027 --> 08:08.561
Him fawning all over a girl

08:08.562 --> 08:10.595
you've got wrapped around
your finger helps us.

08:10.596 --> 08:12.267
I don't want Cami getting hurt.

08:12.268 --> 08:14.533
She's already got witches spying on her.

08:14.534 --> 08:16.304
Do you have any idea
what Klaus is gonna do

08:16.305 --> 08:18.078
when he finds out that we hooked up?

08:18.079 --> 08:19.204
Not my problem.

08:19.205 --> 08:22.791
The thing we need to worry about
is what his hybrid ass is up to.

08:22.792 --> 08:24.782
He's got something going
on with the witches,

08:24.783 --> 08:26.916
and he's doing it
behind Elijah's back.

08:26.917 --> 08:29.451
Whatever he's up to,
if I can find proof...

08:29.452 --> 08:32.116
Oh, you'll what? You're gonna rat
him out to his older brother?

08:32.118 --> 08:34.010
You're gonna turn them
against each other?

08:34.010 --> 08:35.761
You're exiled from the quarter.

08:35.763 --> 08:37.658
Elijah even smells you
coming and you're dead.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.559
You don't know them like I do.

08:41.075 --> 08:43.227
They're half turned
against each other already.

08:43.229 --> 08:47.899
1,000 years of family
drama, pride, guilt, envy,

08:47.900 --> 08:50.068
all built up like a powder keg.

08:50.069 --> 08:52.938
All you have to do is light a match.

08:52.939 --> 08:54.803
Then where do we buy matches?

08:57.341 --> 09:00.120
Look around, Marcel.
We have nothing.

09:00.121 --> 09:01.624
I started with nothing.

09:03.411 --> 09:06.129
Hell, things didn't get
rolling until I turned you.

09:07.726 --> 09:11.984
You and your music and the
whole city for the taking.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.655
Those were the days, T.

09:14.656 --> 09:16.264
Let's go get them back.

09:18.654 --> 09:20.307
And who put you in charge?

09:20.308 --> 09:22.360
I communed with the ancestors.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.398
They said it's time for
you to sacrifice yourself.

09:29.369 --> 09:35.033
Of course. It will be an honor
to fulfill my duty to our coven.

09:36.672 --> 09:39.075
But it's not quite my time yet.

09:39.076 --> 09:40.513
The ancestors were very clear.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.616
We need for you to die so
our community can have

09:42.617 --> 09:44.456
the full power of the harvest.

09:44.457 --> 09:46.291
Careful, Monique.

09:46.292 --> 09:48.918
Not so long ago,
I was one of those ancestors.

09:48.919 --> 09:51.129
A spirit forced to watch
as little by little,

09:51.130 --> 09:54.344
witches surrendered
everything to vampires.

09:56.775 --> 09:59.406
We may no longer live
under Marcel's thumb,

09:59.407 --> 10:03.975
but I for one don't particularly
enjoy answering to Elijah, either.

10:03.976 --> 10:06.561
Before I take my leave,
I'd like to ensure

10:06.562 --> 10:09.916
that you have the power
to control your own fate.

10:09.917 --> 10:12.820
The Mikaelsons' mother
Esther was a powerful witch.

10:14.043 --> 10:17.993
Her spellbook contains enchantments
that we can use to our own ends.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.964
I can steal it for our coven

10:19.965 --> 10:22.163
and we'll never be held
in subjugation again.

10:24.011 --> 10:25.704
You'll have your sacrifice...

10:27.010 --> 10:30.961
But I have things to do before I die.

10:35.731 --> 10:38.075
You want us to go to a witch event

10:38.076 --> 10:39.516
on bended knee and give them a gift?

10:40.915 --> 10:42.686
I'm sorry, but I just remembered.

10:42.687 --> 10:45.433
We're busy doing just about
anything else that night.

10:45.434 --> 10:46.923
Diego, this isn't a request.

10:46.924 --> 10:48.424
Your name is on that treaty.

10:48.425 --> 10:50.625
Now, if you have
any difficulty whatsoever

10:50.626 --> 10:54.904
with your newfound position, I'd be
more than willing to remove you.

10:58.471 --> 11:00.172
I never thought I'd see the day.

11:00.173 --> 11:02.340
Vampires bowing down to witches.

11:02.341 --> 11:04.775
I see it as a demonstration
of strength...

11:04.776 --> 11:07.080
Acknowledging a lesser faction.

11:07.081 --> 11:10.003
But you're not asking, are you?

11:13.488 --> 11:16.825
I see it's true what
they say about you, Elijah.

11:16.826 --> 11:19.993
You make even
strong-arming seem noble.

11:21.828 --> 11:27.503
Well...
The tourists do eat this stuff up.

11:27.504 --> 11:28.872
Can you imagine what they'd think if

11:28.873 --> 11:31.773
they suddenly found
out it was all real?

11:31.774 --> 11:33.972
I take it you want me
at the public show

11:33.973 --> 11:36.192
and the private party afterward?

11:36.193 --> 11:37.677
That is correct.

11:37.678 --> 11:39.345
I'd be happy to attend.

11:40.963 --> 11:44.184
And in return, you will
owe the humans a favor.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.921
Your people are uniquely poised

11:46.922 --> 11:49.425
to set an example for
the rest of the french quarter.

11:49.426 --> 11:52.529
Which is why it's important
for the wolves to attend.

11:52.530 --> 11:54.544
Thanks but no thanks?

11:54.545 --> 11:55.796
Let's hear the man out.

11:55.797 --> 11:58.899
The witches are the ones
that cursed your pack.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.368
And they've been
nothing but crap to me

12:00.369 --> 12:02.402
since I first came to town. No.

12:04.105 --> 12:05.224
We're not going.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.039
It's a new day in the quarter, Hayley.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.336
I agree with Oliver.

12:11.206 --> 12:13.408
If we're gonna coexist,
we have to play ball.

12:13.409 --> 12:16.486
We'll send a representative
with a gift.

12:30.394 --> 12:31.794
That was too easy.

12:33.390 --> 12:34.698
Don't trust him.

12:36.268 --> 12:37.702
Don't trust any of them.

12:47.279 --> 12:48.893
You don't stop squirming,

12:49.419 --> 12:52.644
I don't care who you know, I'm
gonna kneecap you right here.

12:52.645 --> 12:56.263
When I asked you to bring Cary
to me, it was as my guest.

12:56.264 --> 12:58.024
Might I recommend you release him

12:58.025 --> 13:00.613
before I opt to release you
from your mortal coil.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.345
I found him like you
asked and he jumped me.

13:06.346 --> 13:07.412
Now, his pack's been going at mine

13:07.413 --> 13:09.744
since the beginning of time
I don't owe him a thing.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.820
You see, it's that shortsighted attitude

13:11.821 --> 13:13.957
that led to the demise
of the werewolves.

13:13.958 --> 13:16.087
I'm pretty sure Marcel
and the witches did that.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.378
The packs should have been united.

13:18.379 --> 13:20.838
Marcel saw that weakness
and he exploited it.

13:20.839 --> 13:23.141
If you seek to rebuild
with only the crescents,

13:23.142 --> 13:25.513
you may as well stay
in your hovels in the bog.

13:30.328 --> 13:32.783
I don't believe we've had
the pleasure of an introduction.

13:32.784 --> 13:34.720
Legele says you're
descended from our line.

13:34.721 --> 13:36.604
The legends are true.

13:36.605 --> 13:41.131
Come here. I understand that
this ring was passed down

13:41.132 --> 13:42.997
through generations of our family.

13:45.671 --> 13:47.699
I need to know what stone it housed.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.534
I never saw it with a stone.

13:49.535 --> 13:52.161
Could you ask around
for me, mate? Hmm?

13:52.162 --> 13:54.479
See what you can find out.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.482
You can't just start
a revolution all on your own

13:57.483 --> 13:59.085
from exile across the river.

13:59.086 --> 14:02.257
I mean, like it or not, Elijah's
plan is the new reality.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.391
Elijah's got you
bowing down to witches.

14:04.392 --> 14:07.695
How long until you're
kowtowing to werewolves?

14:07.696 --> 14:11.902
Right. And who's gonna lead
this rebellion, huh? You?

14:13.371 --> 14:15.005
I got a few ideas.

14:17.676 --> 14:21.484
I remember the last time I stood
with you against an original.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.859
Didn't go so well.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.290
All we gotta do is show
that we won't bow down.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.157
Make enough noise, they'll leave.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.830
I figure we can be a lot louder
if we're in it together.

14:30.831 --> 14:34.769
Look, Elijah Mikaelson's
a dick, no doubt.

14:34.770 --> 14:37.138
Thing is, with him at
least I know where I stand.

14:37.139 --> 14:38.503
Do you?

14:38.599 --> 14:40.505
We've been watching Klaus.

14:41.040 --> 14:45.506
Making deals with witches, holding
secret meetings with werewolves.

14:45.507 --> 14:47.383
You can't trust these people.

14:47.384 --> 14:49.469
You're the one who
picked up Klaus' coin.

14:49.470 --> 14:50.508
You, Marcel.

14:50.509 --> 14:52.909
Maybe T's got a short you're
the one who memory, but I don't.

14:54.615 --> 14:55.895
You're a coward.

14:57.677 --> 14:59.612
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:03.348 --> 15:06.049
When I picked up that coin,
I was saving your ass.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.698
Klaus was gonna kill all of you.

15:08.615 --> 15:11.217
A good leader knows when he's
gotta fight another day.

15:11.218 --> 15:12.449
Now that day's here.

15:12.450 --> 15:14.385
I'm ready. You gonna fight with me?

15:14.386 --> 15:17.588
With what? Huh?
Look around.

15:17.589 --> 15:20.626
All you got is Thierry
and a whole bunch of talk.

15:20.627 --> 15:22.896
You guys don't seem to get it.
You lost, all right?

15:22.897 --> 15:25.627
I picked the winning side, so
if you want to start a war...

15:26.594 --> 15:28.162
You're fighting against me.

15:34.863 --> 15:36.976
Time we got more persuasive.

15:43.046 --> 15:44.981
What is this?
High School?

15:44.982 --> 15:47.150
Why don't you take the hint
and mind your own business?

15:49.419 --> 15:50.489
This is my pack.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.118
That makes it my business.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.560
No need to get all riled up.

15:54.561 --> 15:55.595
It's not good for you, Hayley.

15:55.596 --> 15:57.230
I have tried no need to get
to play nice.

15:57.231 --> 16:00.289
The last month of pregnancy is
all hormones and mood swings,

16:00.290 --> 16:02.497
so unless you want me to
snap your arm like a twig,

16:02.498 --> 16:04.898
I suggest that you
tell me what is going on.

16:04.899 --> 16:06.467
- You can go to hell.
- Knock it off.

16:06.468 --> 16:07.969
There's no reason to keep it from her.

16:07.970 --> 16:09.438
I can think of a reason.

16:09.439 --> 16:12.010
Tall and immortal and wears
a pocket scarf. Uhh!

16:12.011 --> 16:15.447
Hayley, you're one of us.
You deserve to know.

16:15.448 --> 16:16.681
Go on.

16:24.989 --> 16:29.293
We made an alliance... That's gonna
change everything for the wolves.

16:29.294 --> 16:31.237
An alliance with who?

16:31.238 --> 16:32.237
Klaus.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.132
Tell me everything.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.672
You came all this way to
beg for some human's life?

16:39.673 --> 16:43.809
Father Kieran's time is running out
and he has been an ally to me.

16:43.810 --> 16:46.978
Your ally, and Cami's uncle.

16:48.214 --> 16:51.782
Sorry. As I've already said,
there's no way to undo that hex.

16:51.783 --> 16:54.585
Oh, come on. You and I both
know there's always a loophole.

16:54.586 --> 16:56.522
Not for this.

16:56.523 --> 16:58.059
At least not among my people.

16:58.155 --> 16:59.994
Although I do wonder.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.764
Your mother was powerful.

17:03.765 --> 17:06.314
She would have had access
to all manner of spells.

17:06.315 --> 17:07.944
Perhaps I could take a look

17:08.040 --> 17:09.771
through her grimoire.

17:09.772 --> 17:11.875
You want to use
father Kieran's ailment

17:11.876 --> 17:14.209
as an excuse to look through
my mother's spellbook.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.508
Very devious.

17:15.509 --> 17:17.828
Come on.
The grimoire is worthless to you.

17:18.978 --> 17:22.451
But with its power, I could
solidify my place in the coven.

17:22.452 --> 17:23.752
No, I'm sorry, love.

17:23.753 --> 17:26.959
It's bad enough my mother's power was
consecrated with your ancestors.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.622
The last thing I need is for you to

17:28.623 --> 17:31.839
get a look at an entire book
of her dirty, little tricks.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.064
That's unfortunate.

17:34.065 --> 17:36.098
Particularly for poor father Kieran.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.100
I guess you'll be
the one to tell Cami.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.443
You think you have leverage over me?

17:44.444 --> 17:47.380
I will not be manipulated.

17:52.834 --> 17:56.086
And I won't be threatened.
So, between the two of us,

17:56.087 --> 17:57.621
we each know where we stand.

17:57.622 --> 18:00.326
As long as we can retain
that mutual respect,

18:00.327 --> 18:02.957
I don't see a need for any
further demonstrations of power.

18:03.464 --> 18:05.001
Don't call me again.

18:46.596 --> 18:48.237
It's time.

18:48.238 --> 18:52.073
Klaus will be at the event, which
means the compound will be empty.

18:52.074 --> 18:53.508
You know what to do.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.271
Now, in accordance with
the fete des benedictions,

19:16.272 --> 19:19.992
the witches of New
Orleans bless you all.

20:31.527 --> 20:33.524
A little too easy, isn't it?

20:35.664 --> 20:37.486
I've been expecting you.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.403
You're late.

20:48.760 --> 20:49.977
Davina.

20:51.429 --> 20:52.957
Elijah.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.218
It's lovely to see you.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.587
And under far better circumstances.

20:57.588 --> 20:59.055
Is it?

20:59.056 --> 21:01.727
My friend Tim is still dead and
your brother's still breathing.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.231
Davina, that's enough.

21:03.232 --> 21:05.386
Elijah has been a patron
to us this evening.

21:05.387 --> 21:07.558
We will show him respect.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.009
Thank you for all of this.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.687
This isn't for you.

21:14.688 --> 21:17.214
You know as well as I that your
people would never accept a truce

21:17.215 --> 21:19.451
unless we showed them some respect.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.751
So be it.

21:23.378 --> 21:25.159
Enjoy your party.

21:33.096 --> 21:37.496
Strange. I thought you'd be in the
company of your colorful friends.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.796
Oh. You asked for a representative
for the werewolves,

21:40.797 --> 21:44.099
so... take me or leave me.

21:54.817 --> 21:56.019
Is something wrong?

21:57.662 --> 22:00.459
These people came to praise witches.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.561
What has she done
to prove herself worthy?

22:02.562 --> 22:05.162
She's a harvest girl.
Like you.

22:06.834 --> 22:09.305
Our power is a gift
from the ancestors.

22:09.306 --> 22:11.905
I've had to make sacrifices
to honor that gift.

22:13.136 --> 22:16.165
I lost my mother.
My aunt.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.128
Davina has done nothing
but stand against us.

22:18.979 --> 22:21.212
She just needs a little lesson.

22:21.213 --> 22:24.718
If there's one thing I'm good at,
it's putting people in their place.

22:30.487 --> 22:35.732
Welcome. As is our
time-honored tradition,

22:35.733 --> 22:38.970
you are all welcome to
deliver your offerings.

22:39.454 --> 22:42.879
It is our custom that no one
should be turned away,

22:42.880 --> 22:45.181
no blessing be denied.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.799
Do you get any gifts?

23:31.536 --> 23:32.604
What are you doing here?

23:32.605 --> 23:35.369
Technically, I'm crashing,
but it's you I came to see.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.167
Don't worry, I just want to say
my piece and then I'll leave.

23:38.979 --> 23:40.210
Here.

23:40.781 --> 23:42.293
And what is this?

23:42.294 --> 23:44.413
An offering, from me.

23:44.414 --> 23:46.172
I know we have no reason
to like each other,

23:46.173 --> 23:48.591
but I want to honor
what Elijah has built.

23:48.592 --> 23:50.676
What my uncle worked for.

23:50.677 --> 23:53.429
Oh. So this is about your uncle.

23:53.430 --> 23:57.395
Like I said, I know you have no
reason to help me, but Klaus said

23:57.396 --> 24:00.167
a long time ago,
you were cheated out of life, and

24:00.168 --> 24:05.507
if I can't help him, if you can't
help him, neither will he.

24:05.508 --> 24:09.406
And so I'm asking you... please.

24:14.653 --> 24:17.036
Klaus said you were from this era.

24:17.037 --> 24:21.525
And I thought with your red hair...
I had one just like this.

24:27.501 --> 24:30.170
Perhaps I can help you.

24:47.195 --> 24:50.194
Josh. What are you doing here?

24:50.195 --> 24:51.530
What, are you kidding?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.163
No way I'd miss out on your big day.

24:53.671 --> 24:55.741
Besides, music, wind, fire...

24:55.742 --> 24:58.122
The club kid in me
is, like, in heaven.

25:01.143 --> 25:03.752
You don't look like you're
having much fun, though.

25:05.781 --> 25:09.630
Hey. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

25:09.631 --> 25:11.354
Joshua.

25:11.856 --> 25:14.304
What a fortunate coincidence
finding you here.

25:15.985 --> 25:17.593
We have unfinished business.

25:25.234 --> 25:26.468
You need to leave here.
Right now.

25:26.469 --> 25:27.770
Now, to be fair, you're not

25:27.771 --> 25:29.572
quite as powerful as
you once were, are you?

25:29.573 --> 25:31.339
You're in no position to give orders.

25:33.475 --> 25:34.609
Come along, lad.

25:34.610 --> 25:35.942
Hey, can we talk about this?

25:35.943 --> 25:37.142
Josh!

25:39.413 --> 25:44.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

25:44.040 --> 25:49.715
We are gathered here today to pay
homage to our beloved witches,

25:50.460 --> 25:56.054
but one very special witch
has been utterly ignored.

25:57.894 --> 26:00.017
That seems
a little unfair to me.

26:03.003 --> 26:04.171
No.

26:06.703 --> 26:08.317
I don't want your gift.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.843
I understand why you would
reject me, given our past

26:16.812 --> 26:22.453
in truth, many of us here today
have been wronged in the conflict

26:22.454 --> 26:24.618
which my brother's treaty ended.

26:24.619 --> 26:28.088
Your friend Josh was involved
in a plot to kill me.

26:28.089 --> 26:34.088
It would be well within my right
to execute him here and now.

26:37.532 --> 26:41.971
But. In the spirit of solidarity,

26:41.972 --> 26:46.063
and for your favor, Davina,
I hereby pardon him.

26:47.452 --> 26:52.528
Josh... from this day forward, you
have nothing to fear from me.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.400
Please.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.515
So are you gonna open it?

27:33.487 --> 27:35.693
What? What is it?

27:35.694 --> 27:37.739
It's the spell that
makes daylight rings.

27:46.386 --> 27:49.174
I hear you made quite an
impression with the wolves.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.777
My arrangement with them was
supposed to be a secret,

27:52.778 --> 27:54.511
and yet you forced it out of them.

27:54.512 --> 27:56.046
It's very bold.

27:56.047 --> 28:01.677
As was your decision to represent
them here today, on your own.

28:01.678 --> 28:04.757
I trust you'll do nothing
to harm our cause.

28:04.758 --> 28:07.516
Are you really gonna go
behind Elijah's back?

28:07.517 --> 28:10.497
What difference does it make to you
as long as your people benefit?

28:10.498 --> 28:14.937
If I find out that you are playing
some game, trying to manipulate us

28:14.938 --> 28:16.106
for one of your schemes...

28:16.107 --> 28:17.442
You know, you've come a long way,

28:17.443 --> 28:18.947
little wolf.

28:20.413 --> 28:23.182
I knew you were tough,
I knew you were cunning,

28:23.183 --> 28:25.151
but I never knew you were a queen.

28:50.852 --> 28:54.062
Happy fete des benedictions.

28:54.063 --> 29:01.406
We have a message for all
of you from Marcel Gerard.

29:18.621 --> 29:20.217
Control yourselves.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.175
This is a vulgar trick.

29:23.176 --> 29:26.348
We do not violate our agreement.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.304
Hey!

29:45.880 --> 29:47.783
- Elijah?
- Hayley.

29:47.784 --> 29:50.280
It's okay.
It's all right.

30:14.995 --> 30:16.361
Blood on the walls.
Pile of bodies.

30:16.362 --> 30:18.162
All in all, I'd say message received.

30:18.163 --> 30:19.662
Did you get Davina out first?

30:19.663 --> 30:21.799
As planned, Josh took care of Davina.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.136
I made sure the other harvest
girls got out in the clear.

30:24.137 --> 30:26.474
That was just the warning shot.

30:26.475 --> 30:27.843
Now we double down.

30:27.844 --> 30:29.209
Marcel!

30:29.210 --> 30:30.495
Aah!

30:33.918 --> 30:35.355
I.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.626
And yet still you return
to the french quarter.

30:39.627 --> 30:42.257
You gonna kill me, Elijah? Go ahead.

30:42.353 --> 30:44.864
But then you won't know
what Klaus has got going

30:44.865 --> 30:46.334
with that witch in his pocket.

30:46.335 --> 30:47.801
Oh, whatever shall I do?

30:47.802 --> 30:49.511
I suppose I could just ask him.

30:49.512 --> 30:52.174
Yeah. Make sure he tells you all about

30:52.175 --> 30:54.678
the secret meetings
with the werewolves.

30:54.679 --> 30:57.317
That is, if he's still speaking to you

30:57.318 --> 30:59.062
once he knows that you killed me.

30:59.063 --> 31:00.853
Do you not know me?

31:10.673 --> 31:12.078
For your violation.

31:17.246 --> 31:19.461
No. No, no.

31:26.723 --> 31:31.730
You live... or you die
according to my will.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.303
Try to remember that.

31:47.391 --> 31:49.115
You left without my offering.

31:50.228 --> 31:52.260
Your vampires ruined my party.

31:52.261 --> 31:55.535
Oh, they're not
my vampires anymore, love.

31:55.536 --> 31:57.200
Although Marcel certainly took a page

31:57.201 --> 32:00.271
out of my book of dramatic effect.

32:00.272 --> 32:04.381
Look, I owed Davina some consolation
because I killed her first love.

32:06.613 --> 32:09.049
I do try to make up
for my wrongdoings.

32:09.050 --> 32:11.455
As with our little quarrel earlier.

32:13.156 --> 32:15.058
So. Here.

32:16.124 --> 32:18.103
I picked it out earlier tonight.

32:18.199 --> 32:21.464
A friend of yours gave me a hand.

32:21.465 --> 32:22.899
And what friend was that?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.970
Well, open it.
See for yourself.

32:30.076 --> 32:34.160
Did you really think I would leave
my mother's grimoire unprotected?

32:40.429 --> 32:46.548
A century ago, I dreamed of what
it would be like to know you.

32:48.020 --> 32:49.673
Now I'm glad I didn't.

32:49.674 --> 32:52.827
I might have been naive enough
to fall for you, or fear you,

32:52.828 --> 32:56.564
but I learned a lot in death,
and trust me, Klaus Mikaelson:

32:56.565 --> 32:58.999
It's you who should be afraid of me.

33:02.970 --> 33:05.108
Pity. I will miss the sex.

33:07.641 --> 33:09.321
Your friend Cami showed up tonight.

33:10.668 --> 33:13.180
Her offering was quite sweet.

33:13.983 --> 33:17.215
So I gave her hope that I
would lift Kieran's hex,

33:17.216 --> 33:18.371
but there is no hope.

33:20.011 --> 33:22.125
Or if there was, there isn't now.

33:22.657 --> 33:25.192
If the priest dies, then believe me,

33:25.193 --> 33:26.959
you will follow swiftly after him.

33:26.960 --> 33:34.170
It would be foolish of
you to kill me, a potential ally,

33:34.171 --> 33:37.471
in defense of some powerless
human who is, by the way,

33:37.472 --> 33:40.545
sleeping with your enemy... Marcel.

33:45.581 --> 33:47.148
I've learned my lesson.

33:47.149 --> 33:48.915
At first I was against your plan.

33:48.916 --> 33:51.886
I thought that we should just
live with Elijah's treaty,

33:51.887 --> 33:55.614
but after that party,
those innocent people.

33:55.615 --> 33:57.531
There will never be a peace.

33:57.532 --> 34:01.953
The weak will always be at the mercy
of whoever is calling the shots.

34:01.954 --> 34:03.580
It's survival of the fittest.

34:03.581 --> 34:06.375
We need to protect ourselves.

34:06.932 --> 34:11.299
And we... we need
to protect each other.

34:17.491 --> 34:20.388
We need to use Klaus' help while
he's still willing to give it.

34:20.389 --> 34:26.429
But Jackson... From now on, you
have to tell me everything.

34:26.431 --> 34:31.069
And no matter what...
We do not trust Klaus.

34:40.516 --> 34:43.081
Well, I see that you've already
avenged the little wolf.

34:46.119 --> 34:49.292
But judging by your look,
you're still out for blood.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.460
If the definition of insanity is doing

34:51.460 --> 34:54.061
the same thing repeatedly and
expecting different results,

34:54.062 --> 34:56.596
then surely my quest
for your salvation

34:56.597 --> 34:58.967
ranks me as one of the maddest of men.

35:00.470 --> 35:05.100
Come on, then. What horrible deed
has the bastard done this time?

35:05.101 --> 35:08.145
Do you know, in the past,
I actually appreciated

35:08.146 --> 35:10.355
the methods to your manipulations.

35:10.356 --> 35:13.692
However, now here we are, poised
on the brink of a new era

35:13.693 --> 35:15.944
which will benefit not only
your home but your child,

35:15.945 --> 35:19.239
and you go behind my back
to conspire with wolves.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.117
Conspire is hardly the word I
would use for a family council.

35:22.118 --> 35:24.130
Lest you forget, Elijah,
they are my family

35:24.131 --> 35:25.463
as much as any Mikaelson...

35:25.464 --> 35:28.543
A name, in truth,
I cannot even call my own.

35:30.432 --> 35:33.542
How casually you disavow 1,000
years of allegiance towards you.

35:33.543 --> 35:35.143
And now that I've found the remnants

35:35.144 --> 35:37.340
of my other family,
am I to ignore their plight?

35:37.341 --> 35:39.745
I would've thought you'd
support my desire to help them,

35:39.746 --> 35:42.115
when in doing so,
I help Hayley, and the child.

35:42.116 --> 35:44.764
Do not question my allegiance
towards that child.

35:44.765 --> 35:46.519
Oh, and I suppose
your affection for Hayley

35:46.520 --> 35:48.810
has nothing to do with
your tireless dedication.

35:48.811 --> 35:52.025
Yes, you see, I saw how
you cared for her tonight.

35:52.492 --> 35:54.441
Called her name in the dark.

35:54.442 --> 35:57.655
The zeal with which you destroy
those who would harm her.

36:00.796 --> 36:05.035
I have denied every single impulse
I have ever had for that woman.

36:05.036 --> 36:06.574
Out of some misbegotten respect

36:06.575 --> 36:09.956
for intentions that
you don't even have.

36:09.957 --> 36:11.944
- I'm warning you...
- I'm warning you.

36:11.945 --> 36:14.294
I've forgiven you.
I have stood by you.

36:14.295 --> 36:16.421
I've forsaken every single
one of my desires

36:16.422 --> 36:19.466
in the name of your
ridiculous redemption.

36:19.467 --> 36:22.806
No more.
If I want something...

36:24.595 --> 36:25.891
I'll take it.

36:26.739 --> 36:32.238
And nothing... nothing...
Will stand in my way.

36:55.225 --> 36:56.259
Klaus, what are you...

36:56.260 --> 36:58.293
I came here to apologize.

36:59.897 --> 37:01.845
I've made a terrible mistake.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.932
Whatever it is, you
should sleep it off.

37:03.933 --> 37:05.564
I'm sure it can wait till morning.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.434
You went to Genevieve.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.335
She was moved by your plea.

37:11.336 --> 37:12.974
She may even have cured Kieran.

37:12.975 --> 37:15.024
But I insulted her.

37:16.705 --> 37:21.072
And as a means of revenge,
she is refusing him aid.

37:22.680 --> 37:29.590
Kieran will die because of me,
and it will be a horrible death.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.086
Why are you telling me this?

37:35.182 --> 37:40.236
Because I believe that
secrets are a poison.

37:40.237 --> 37:42.939
They need to be spat out.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.075
Like your secret...

37:45.076 --> 37:47.477
About your time with Marcel.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.519
Isn't that what you wanted?

37:57.755 --> 37:59.899
You compelled me
to go out with Marcel.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.358
You made me your spy.

38:01.359 --> 38:03.528
And maybe it's your fault
we got together,

38:03.529 --> 38:06.029
and you're just mad because
you didn't get to control it.

38:08.299 --> 38:14.298
You tell Marcel if I see him again,
I'll kill him.

38:37.798 --> 38:39.500
You don't need to keep coming out.

38:42.416 --> 38:46.146
I'd tell you if something was wrong.

38:46.147 --> 38:47.580
But she's doing ok.

38:50.017 --> 38:53.023
The girl has a natural
gift for leading.

38:53.024 --> 38:55.166
She surprised everyone.

38:56.861 --> 38:58.062
Not everyone.

39:09.846 --> 39:12.216
Do you want to join us?

39:15.491 --> 39:16.955
What I want...

39:19.993 --> 39:21.862
Is for that girl to be happy.

39:25.706 --> 39:27.206
Don't tell her I was here.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.955
This is Thierry Vanchure.

39:34.956 --> 39:39.292
Mean-ass horn player,
lover of feisty women,

39:39.293 --> 39:41.459
witch, vampire, and human alike.

39:47.147 --> 39:52.206
I rebuilt this city with him
and he always had my back.

39:52.207 --> 39:54.507
Even when I screwed up
and forgot to have his.

39:56.443 --> 39:57.677
And now...

39:59.414 --> 40:01.485
All I can do is promise you this, t.

40:03.557 --> 40:05.403
I won't let you die in vain.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.360
I will take back our city.

40:17.977 --> 40:19.834
Going up against The Originals?

40:22.185 --> 40:24.169
For real, no backing down?

40:24.170 --> 40:25.789
No backing down.

40:53.130 --> 40:54.465
You failed us.

40:54.466 --> 40:56.201
I told you.
It will take time.

40:56.202 --> 40:58.635
Do you think the ancestors
care about your excuses?

40:58.636 --> 41:01.471
The vampires attacked us.
We can't retaliate

41:01.472 --> 41:03.378
until we possess our full strength.

41:04.544 --> 41:06.614
Your sacrifice is the final step.

41:20.240 --> 41:24.187
Nous concedumus sa vie a Genevieve.

41:24.188 --> 41:27.398
Si elle hecatage a filia de Mikaelson.

41:30.592 --> 41:32.073
What are they saying?

41:33.526 --> 41:35.451
They told me to let you live.

41:37.591 --> 41:39.705
But in exchange, they
want another offering.

41:41.553 --> 41:43.373
One of their choosing.

41:43.374 --> 41:46.417
Tell me. Whatever it is they want,
I will make sure they get it.

41:46.418 --> 41:47.710
I swear it.

41:47.711 --> 41:49.132
It's the child.

41:50.729 --> 41:53.311
They want us to kill Klaus' child.
