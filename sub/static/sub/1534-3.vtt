00:02.148 --> 00:03.936
<i>Previously on Once Upon A Time...</i>

00:03.936 --> 00:05.358
- Who are you?
- My name is Elsa.

00:05.358 --> 00:06.602
I'm looking for my sister.

00:06.727 --> 00:09.195
Through Belle, there's
love in my life again.

00:09.230 --> 00:10.329
I've started it with a lie.

00:10.364 --> 00:12.030
She thinks she has the real dagger.

00:12.065 --> 00:14.367
Regina... I-I want you to meet Marian.

00:14.401 --> 00:16.369
Are you two together? Leroy: Power's out.

00:16.403 --> 00:17.970
- So are you gonna do about it?
- Me?

00:18.004 --> 00:20.005
- You are the mayor now.
- I am?

00:20.039 --> 00:21.707
Elsa: It should be melting away.

00:21.742 --> 00:22.775
I'm the only one with this power.

00:22.809 --> 00:24.410
I should be able to undo it.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.957
I know this town might
seem strange at first,

00:38.992 --> 00:41.626
but you do get used to it.

00:41.661 --> 00:43.395
And roland loves it here.

00:43.429 --> 00:45.563
He loves watching the boats at the harbor

00:45.598 --> 00:48.032
and eating at granny's...

00:48.066 --> 00:49.801
And ice cream.

00:49.835 --> 00:51.836
Yes. How could we forget about ice cream?

00:51.870 --> 00:54.038
Can we get some now, please?

00:54.072 --> 00:55.373
Well, I think your mother's seen

00:55.408 --> 00:56.741
enough strange things for one day.

00:56.776 --> 00:58.009
We should get back to the camp.

00:58.043 --> 01:00.778
Please, mom? Regina let me.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.647
Sure.

01:05.684 --> 01:08.719
Rocky road for the little man.

01:08.753 --> 01:10.487
Thank you.

01:10.522 --> 01:12.723
[Chuckles] You're welcome.
And his dashing father.

01:12.757 --> 01:16.160
And I don't believe that
I've met the beautiful mother.

01:16.195 --> 01:18.228
Uh, this is Marian.

01:18.262 --> 01:20.997
It is lovely to finally meet you, Marian.

01:21.032 --> 01:24.000
Well, since you've been
through such an ordeal,

01:24.035 --> 01:27.638
the least I can do is... is
get you something on the house.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.773
What flavor would you like?

01:29.808 --> 01:31.608
I...Don't know.

01:31.643 --> 01:33.109
Uh, in our world,

01:33.144 --> 01:36.847
the, uh, flavor choices
of ice were dirt and mud.

01:36.881 --> 01:39.883
In this world, we've
made some improvements.

01:40.952 --> 01:43.586
Trust me, there is no problem

01:43.620 --> 01:47.190
that can't be solved
with a bit of ice cream.

01:59.603 --> 02:01.303
Thank you. That's very kind.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.972
No, thank you.

02:03.006 --> 02:06.641
Seeing a happy family like yours in here

02:06.676 --> 02:08.877
really warms my heart.

02:13.183 --> 02:15.184
Mmm. [Chuckles]

02:29.298 --> 02:30.599
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

02:30.633 --> 02:32.601
but I've never seen her before in my life.

02:32.635 --> 02:34.302
So how'd she end up inside your urn

02:34.336 --> 02:36.004
inside your secret vault of terror?

02:36.038 --> 02:38.673
Look, if you really want to
know how she wound up there,

02:38.708 --> 02:40.574
she's standing right beside you, miss Swan.

02:40.609 --> 02:41.943
Why don't you simply ask her?

02:41.977 --> 02:44.279
She did. But I can't remember.

02:44.313 --> 02:45.914
Something happened to my memories.

02:45.948 --> 02:49.483
Well, an all-too-common
affliction 'round these parts.

02:49.518 --> 02:50.785
Pity.

02:50.819 --> 02:53.955
But as you can see, many objects
fall into my possession...

02:53.989 --> 02:57.458
urns, necklaces, all manner of things.

02:57.492 --> 02:58.793
I can't know the history
behind all of them.

02:58.827 --> 03:00.428
Only if there's something in it for you.

03:00.462 --> 03:01.529
Right, mate?

03:01.563 --> 03:03.864
Yeah, well, that may have been true once.

03:03.899 --> 03:07.200
But recently my life has been...

03:07.235 --> 03:09.303
Turned upside down.

03:09.337 --> 03:14.641
I've lost a son. I've gained a wife.

03:14.675 --> 03:16.643
So you might say...

03:16.677 --> 03:18.511
I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.513
Emma: Don't forget about my super power.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.115
I'll be able to tell if you're lying.

03:22.150 --> 03:23.450
How about I do you one better?

03:23.484 --> 03:25.652
Let's simply have Belle
use the dagger on me.

03:25.686 --> 03:27.154
[Stammers] No. No.

03:27.188 --> 03:29.489
Rumple, you don't... you
don't have to do that.

03:29.523 --> 03:31.458
No, no, no. Miss Swan wants proof.

03:31.492 --> 03:33.125
And I'm happy to cooperate.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.763
[Sighs] Fine.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.201
[Sighs]

03:42.235 --> 03:46.372
I command you, dark one...

03:46.406 --> 03:50.042
To tell them the truth.

03:50.077 --> 03:52.378
The truth is...

03:52.412 --> 03:55.348
Just as I said.

03:55.382 --> 03:59.352
I had no idea there was
someone inside there.

03:59.386 --> 04:00.853
I know nothing about Elsa.

04:02.421 --> 04:03.822
Or her sister.

04:05.792 --> 04:07.793
But I wish you best of luck finding her.

04:10.262 --> 04:12.598
Elsa: So, no one has heard from Anna?

04:12.632 --> 04:15.266
There's been no sightings
from any of the scouts?

04:15.301 --> 04:18.168
Since you asked me 10 seconds ago?

04:18.204 --> 04:19.437
Nope.

04:19.471 --> 04:21.206
She's gonna be fine.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.742
I've seen Anna fight
wolves and snow monsters

04:24.776 --> 04:26.411
and that idiot from the Southern Isles.

04:26.445 --> 04:28.246
- Hans?
- Whatever his name is.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.581
Look, the point is she
can take care of herself,

04:30.616 --> 04:32.283
so stop worrying.

04:32.318 --> 04:33.951
Well, I can't just sit
here. I'm going after her.

04:33.986 --> 04:36.921
She told me you'd try that
and she told me to stop you.

04:36.955 --> 04:38.523
Well, you can't. I'm the queen.

04:38.557 --> 04:40.024
Which is exactly why you
need to stay in Arendelle,

04:40.058 --> 04:41.191
as you told her.

04:43.962 --> 04:45.596
Yep. Anna was right.

04:45.631 --> 04:47.698
Logic and reason do work on you.

04:47.733 --> 04:51.868
Right now, your kingdom
needs you more than Anna.

04:51.903 --> 04:53.537
She knows me too well.

04:53.571 --> 04:56.773
It's not hard to see. You're a softy.

04:56.807 --> 05:01.211
Beneath that "oh, baby,
I'm the queen" thing.

05:01.246 --> 05:03.914
Why is it your compliments
are so aggravating?

05:03.948 --> 05:06.917
Well, I start out that way,
but you'll warm up to me.

05:06.951 --> 05:08.952
Your majesty.

05:08.986 --> 05:10.453
I apologize for barging in like this,

05:10.487 --> 05:12.221
but we have news from one of our scouts.

05:12.256 --> 05:13.489
Have you found Anna?

05:13.524 --> 05:15.559
No. But they discovered
something else in their search.

05:21.599 --> 05:23.066
What does it say?

05:23.100 --> 05:26.436
There's an army massing
in the Southern mountains.

05:26.470 --> 05:30.106
Heading for Arendelle, led by prince hans.

05:32.109 --> 05:34.743
[Sighs] Well, I know every
inch of those mountains.

05:34.778 --> 05:36.612
Let me sneak up there
and see what he's up to.

05:36.646 --> 05:38.614
I didn't realize the
official Arendelle ice master

05:38.648 --> 05:40.950
and deliverer got a say in matters.

05:42.052 --> 05:43.485
He doesn't.

05:43.519 --> 05:45.788
You're not going anywhere.
It's too dangerous.

05:45.822 --> 05:48.523
<i>Oh, there you go warming
up to me. You do care.</i>

05:48.558 --> 05:49.825
My sister wants a wedding.

05:49.859 --> 05:51.594
It's probably best the groom is alive.

05:51.628 --> 05:53.095
So I'll be real careful.

05:53.129 --> 05:54.763
You're staying right here.

05:54.798 --> 05:57.432
As you said, I am the queen of Arendelle.

05:57.467 --> 06:01.436
So let me be the queen and handle it.

06:01.471 --> 06:03.605
[Indistinct conversations]

06:03.639 --> 06:07.442
Hi.

06:07.477 --> 06:08.943
Come on inside.

06:08.978 --> 06:10.312
Need a hand?

06:10.346 --> 06:12.046
Oh, no. I got it.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.048
You're planning to run
your first fireside chat

06:14.083 --> 06:15.617
holding a newborn?

06:15.651 --> 06:17.814
Yeah, I'm fine. Mothers
are natural multi-taskers.

06:17.814 --> 06:19.648
That may be, but you're
juggling a lot right now.

06:19.846 --> 06:20.524
Well, that's true.

06:20.524 --> 06:22.323
I have to say, I'm starting
to have more and more respect

06:22.357 --> 06:23.891
for our court Jester every day.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.359
Yeah. Rupert was special.

06:25.393 --> 06:26.995
- [Chuckles]
- But you're sure you can...

06:27.029 --> 06:29.664
we took back a kingdom, remember?

06:29.698 --> 06:31.732
I can handle this.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.033
Hi, everyone.

06:33.067 --> 06:37.004
And welcome to the very
first mayor's fireside chat.

06:37.038 --> 06:40.174
For too long, this office
was a place to be feared.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.843
Well, I want every citizen

06:42.877 --> 06:45.212
to feel welcome and included here.

06:45.247 --> 06:48.248
So, if you could just
refer to the meeting agenda

06:48.282 --> 06:49.549
I've printed, there are...

06:49.583 --> 06:51.752
uh, what's this about an ice wall?

06:51.786 --> 06:54.855
Oh, that's, uh, item four.
We'll get to that in a minute.

06:54.889 --> 06:57.590
I vote we skip items one,
two, and three. Show of hands.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.825
[All murmuring]

06:58.860 --> 07:00.160
Yeah, that's... oh,
fine. No, I can...

07:00.194 --> 07:01.895
[sighs] I can be flexible.

07:01.929 --> 07:05.398
The ice wall is nothing to worry about.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.502
For the time being, it does
surround the entire town...

07:09.537 --> 07:10.670
<i>- woman: What?!</i>
- The entire town?

07:10.704 --> 07:11.871
Are you serious?

07:11.905 --> 07:13.105
- So, no.
- [Neal cries]

07:13.140 --> 07:14.607
Oh. Everyone calm down. The
wall isn't hurting anyone.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.909
We've been through all this before.

07:16.943 --> 07:19.379
I ain't worried about the wall.
I'm worried about who made it.

07:19.413 --> 07:21.380
Item five.

07:21.414 --> 07:23.683
Her name is Elsa. She's a friend.

07:23.717 --> 07:25.217
Is she the one that froze my truck?

07:25.251 --> 07:27.787
And made that snow monster
that almost killed Marian?

07:27.821 --> 07:29.588
Bu... I-I'm fine. Really.

07:29.622 --> 07:30.956
I've spoken to Elsa, and I promise you

07:30.991 --> 07:33.292
we will have all of this
under control very soon.

07:33.326 --> 07:36.095
<i>[Distorted] And there will
be no more danger of any kind.</i>

07:36.129 --> 07:38.530
<i>[Distorted] So, if we could
all just circle back around</i>

07:38.565 --> 07:41.032
<i>to item one, we
can all discuss...</i>

07:41.067 --> 07:42.100
Marian!

07:42.134 --> 07:44.903
Marian!

07:44.937 --> 07:46.771
Marian!

07:59.712 --> 08:02.514
I didn't know which ones
you were reading these days.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.517
These are awesome. Much
better than algebra.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.518
- Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

08:06.552 --> 08:07.952
But you didn't have to do this.

08:07.986 --> 08:11.289
Well, I wanted to. But
don't get used to it.

08:11.323 --> 08:12.424
[Both chuckle]

08:16.228 --> 08:21.032
Isn't it funny how these
are just ink and paper

08:21.066 --> 08:23.334
but everything in your storybook is real?

08:23.368 --> 08:25.636
Makes you wonder who wrote it, doesn't it?

08:25.670 --> 08:28.139
- The storybook?
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.173 --> 08:29.340
No one knows.

08:29.374 --> 08:31.008
Oh, come on.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.842
You're such an expert on all this.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.477
You've read it cover to cover.

08:34.511 --> 08:38.482
There's nothing in the book
that gives... Even a clue?

08:38.515 --> 08:40.650
What are you up to?

08:40.684 --> 08:42.986
[Scoffs]

08:43.020 --> 08:45.355
[Sighs]

08:47.625 --> 08:51.094
These stories about me in the book,

08:51.128 --> 08:54.431
I was written as a villain.

08:54.465 --> 08:56.066
[Scoffs]

08:56.100 --> 08:59.735
And things never work out
for the villain, so I...

08:59.770 --> 09:04.740
Want to find who wrote
this book and make them...

09:04.775 --> 09:07.543
Ask them...

09:07.578 --> 09:11.547
To write me a happy ending.

09:11.582 --> 09:13.282
Is that crazy?

09:13.316 --> 09:15.351
This is the best idea you've ever had.

09:15.385 --> 09:18.855
We have to change the book
because it's wrong about you.

09:18.889 --> 09:21.190
We just have to find the clues.

09:21.224 --> 09:23.860
"We"? What? You'll help me?

09:23.894 --> 09:25.695
It'll be our own secret mission.

09:25.729 --> 09:26.863
[Chuckles]

09:26.897 --> 09:30.432
Like that "operation
viper" you had with Emma.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.766
"Cobra," but yeah.

09:31.801 --> 09:35.270
This one we'll call "operation..."

09:35.305 --> 09:36.938
"Mongoose."

09:36.973 --> 09:38.607
Perfect.

09:38.641 --> 09:40.275
"Operation mongoose" it is.

09:40.310 --> 09:41.276
[Bells jingle]

09:41.311 --> 09:42.611
[Laughs]

09:42.645 --> 09:43.745
Oh, Regina.

09:44.847 --> 09:45.814
Can we talk?

09:45.848 --> 09:49.317
[Clears throat]

09:49.351 --> 09:51.285
What are you doing here?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.221
It's Marian. Something's happened to her.

09:53.255 --> 09:55.724
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to turn to.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.893
I need your help.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.461
How is she?

10:00.496 --> 10:03.731
Not good. She's getting colder.

10:03.765 --> 10:05.266
[Sighs] Regina, thanks for coming.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.235
Don't thank me till I've done something.

10:07.269 --> 10:10.838
Who's idea was that?

10:10.872 --> 10:14.208
Oh, I thought I would put my
own personal touch on the office.

10:14.243 --> 10:16.944
Well, you've succeeded.

10:16.978 --> 10:18.612
- [Neal coos]
- Hideously.

10:18.647 --> 10:21.281
Is there anything you can do?

10:21.315 --> 10:24.752
[Exhales sharply] This is strong magic.

10:24.786 --> 10:28.622
I-I can't stop it, but
maybe I can slow it down.

10:28.657 --> 10:30.758
[Footsteps approach]

10:30.792 --> 10:32.560
What happened?

10:32.594 --> 10:35.929
Perhaps you should ask your new friend.

10:35.963 --> 10:38.898
After all, it was her
monster that attacked Marian.

10:38.933 --> 10:40.900
Well, to be fair, we did provoke the beast.

10:40.935 --> 10:43.770
But this isn't my magic.
Someone else did this.

10:43.804 --> 10:45.439
Oh, and we're supposed to trust you?

10:45.473 --> 10:47.607
You can trust me. If she says
it was someone else, it was.

10:49.377 --> 10:50.476
So, how do we break the spell?

10:50.510 --> 10:52.645
The only way to cure a freezing spell

10:52.680 --> 10:54.614
is an act of true love.

10:54.648 --> 10:57.383
True love's kiss.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.989
Well, then there's no time to lose.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.871
What's wrong? Why isn't it working?

11:19.906 --> 11:21.340
David: I've seen this once before,

11:21.374 --> 11:23.308
when Frederick was turned to gold.

11:23.342 --> 11:25.443
- Who the hell's Frederick?
- Long story.

11:25.478 --> 11:27.445
So, the cold is acting as a barrier?

11:27.480 --> 11:28.947
Is there nothing we can do?

11:28.982 --> 11:31.783
Well, every curse is different.

11:31.818 --> 11:34.119
I need more time to study this one.

11:34.153 --> 11:36.888
I'm gonna go find who did
this before it happens again.

11:36.923 --> 11:38.256
Well, I hope you bring backup.

11:39.891 --> 11:41.526
What the hell was that supposed to mean?

11:42.551 --> 11:45.025
Well, between the snow
monster and the cave-in...

11:46.043 --> 11:48.123
seems like the savior
needs saving these days.

11:48.123 --> 11:50.384
I think you're bitter and you're
taking it out on the wrong person.

11:51.583 --> 11:52.661
I'll be fine.

11:54.163 --> 11:56.356
Well, I like that battle
plan, so I'm with you, Swan.

11:56.356 --> 11:57.923
No. Take Elsa to the sheriff's station.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.094
Keep her out of sight. Once
people get word of this,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.312
they're gonna be calling for her head.

12:01.312 --> 12:02.565
I'd rather save yours than hers.

12:02.565 --> 12:03.768
There's someone dangerous out there.

12:03.768 --> 12:05.200
I don't have time to
argue with you about this.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.333
Can you for once just do what I say?

12:08.668 --> 12:09.802
[Grunts]

12:09.836 --> 12:12.037
I am doing what Elsa said.

12:12.072 --> 12:14.406
[Exhales sharply] Well,
the spirit of it, anyway.

12:15.541 --> 12:19.377
Fine. Okay. I'm disobeying her.

12:19.412 --> 12:22.047
But she'll be glad, sven. You'll see.

12:22.082 --> 12:24.316
She just doesn't know it yet.

12:24.350 --> 12:25.985
Now, stay put, buddy.

12:26.019 --> 12:27.285
[Groans]

12:27.320 --> 12:29.321
[Indistinct conversations in distance]

12:36.596 --> 12:38.130
[Horse neighs]

12:38.164 --> 12:40.465
Wow. He wasn't exaggerating.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.167
He really does have 12 brothers.

12:42.201 --> 12:44.469
Jurgen: Hans.

12:44.504 --> 12:47.038
More wood on the fire. It's freezing.

12:47.072 --> 12:49.107
I'm busy. Do it yourself.

12:51.343 --> 12:54.846
Now, is that any way to
treat your big brother?

12:55.781 --> 12:57.548
Maybe I'll throw you on instead.

12:57.582 --> 13:01.552
You would be wise not to insult
the future king of Arendelle.

13:03.522 --> 13:04.855
[Laughter]

13:09.427 --> 13:11.395
Don't you think it's a little early

13:11.429 --> 13:13.230
to be sizing the crown, hans?

13:13.265 --> 13:14.665
Remember what happened the last time.

13:14.699 --> 13:16.333
Of course I remember.

13:16.368 --> 13:19.136
But last time, I didn't have this.

13:22.874 --> 13:25.008
Even if they had enough
men to storm the castle,

13:25.043 --> 13:27.177
I'd freeze them before
they reached the gate.

13:27.211 --> 13:28.178
He's posturing.

13:28.212 --> 13:29.680
Prince hans has seen what you can do.

13:29.714 --> 13:31.281
Kristoff: And he knows how to defeat her.

13:31.315 --> 13:32.949
Kristoff.

13:32.984 --> 13:35.885
Shouldn't you be... somewhere else?

13:35.919 --> 13:37.753
I should be.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.289
I was.

13:39.323 --> 13:41.457
Uh... I mean...

13:41.492 --> 13:43.059
I went to spy on hans, okay?

13:43.093 --> 13:44.627
You disobeyed me.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.563
Punish me after I tell you what I found.

13:46.597 --> 13:49.899
There's an urn hidden in
a cave in the north valley.

13:49.933 --> 13:52.367
It has the power to trap people like you.

13:52.402 --> 13:54.970
People... Like me?

13:55.005 --> 13:56.338
With magic.

13:56.372 --> 13:59.341
Hans wants to use it against
you and then invade Arendelle.

13:59.375 --> 14:01.510
Your majesty, if this is truly his plan,

14:01.544 --> 14:02.912
let us take the fight to him.

14:02.946 --> 14:04.780
No. I will not risk that many lives.

14:04.815 --> 14:07.449
There has to be a way to avoid war.

14:07.483 --> 14:09.451
I know the valley, the cave,

14:09.485 --> 14:11.587
the shortcut that they don't.

14:11.621 --> 14:14.423
Let me bring a few soldiers,
and I will destroy the urn.

14:14.457 --> 14:15.924
You can bring one.

14:17.159 --> 14:18.960
Me.

14:18.994 --> 14:21.597
Elsa's the problem. Today it's Marian.

14:21.631 --> 14:23.265
Tomorrow she could freeze the whole town.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.100
Much as I like to move the hot cocoa,

14:25.134 --> 14:26.634
somebody's got to stop her.

14:26.668 --> 14:30.071
Wait. You can't just condemn
her without all the facts.

14:30.106 --> 14:31.139
Look around.

14:31.173 --> 14:33.208
Who else can turn people into popsicles?

14:33.242 --> 14:34.843
It's Elsa, and we all know it,

14:34.877 --> 14:37.612
so she's got to be stopped
before she hurts someone else.

14:37.646 --> 14:39.580
[All murmuring]

14:45.483 --> 14:47.890
Did hans say anything else
about the urn? Anything at all?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.081
Just that it can trap people like you

14:50.081 --> 14:51.376
and it's really, really old.

14:51.831 --> 14:53.498
Do you understand what that means?

14:53.532 --> 14:55.766
There must have been others like me.

14:55.801 --> 14:57.702
I always thought I was alone.

14:57.736 --> 14:59.704
You've never been alone. You have Anna.

14:59.738 --> 15:02.840
And I love her. But... We're not the same.

15:02.874 --> 15:04.675
Yeah. No, I got that. You know what I mean.

15:04.710 --> 15:08.679
We're sisters, and I love
her, but I have this... Magic.

15:08.714 --> 15:09.947
You should understand.

15:09.982 --> 15:12.083
I mean, you grew up with rock trolls.

15:12.117 --> 15:13.250
So?

15:13.284 --> 15:17.221
So you're human and
they're, you know, rocks.

15:17.255 --> 15:19.289
[Scoffs] They're family.

15:19.324 --> 15:21.626
They just wanted what was best for me.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.227
I guess I never really felt alone.

15:23.261 --> 15:24.695
Wish I could see it like that.

15:24.730 --> 15:25.862
Whoa! Watch out!

15:25.896 --> 15:28.965
- [Gasps]
- [Rocks clatter]

15:30.568 --> 15:33.703

- Welcome to the north valley.

15:33.738 --> 15:34.838
[Sighs]

15:34.872 --> 15:38.175
The cave is about 100 feet straight down.

15:38.209 --> 15:39.809
Not a problem.

15:39.844 --> 15:41.978
Would you prefer a slide
or a spiral staircase?

15:42.013 --> 15:44.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. We can't use magic.

15:44.081 --> 15:47.316
Hans might see it and
be right on top of us.

15:47.351 --> 15:49.485
Well, what would you suggest?

15:49.520 --> 15:54.357
Well, something a bit more rustic.

15:55.893 --> 15:57.994
[Indistinct conversations]

15:58.029 --> 15:59.328
Wait.

16:02.732 --> 16:04.200
All right. Coast is clear.

16:07.404 --> 16:09.572
That means go, love.

16:09.606 --> 16:11.607
I'm not coming with you.

16:11.642 --> 16:14.443
There's someone out there
with powers like mine.

16:14.478 --> 16:15.644
I need to find out who.

16:15.679 --> 16:18.613
I...I can't just hide out
in some sheriff's station.

16:18.648 --> 16:21.116
Oh. Well, that works
out quite nicely, then.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.285
- 'Cause that's not where we're going.
- It's not?

16:23.319 --> 16:25.353
With Emma running into
danger? Not a chance in hell.

16:25.388 --> 16:26.922
And the sheriff's station's that way.

16:26.956 --> 16:29.024
And what's that way?

16:29.059 --> 16:33.094
With any luck, danger.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.368
David: Robin and Marian's tent's up ahead.

16:40.403 --> 16:43.205
So, what exactly are we looking for?

16:43.239 --> 16:46.208
If whoever cursed Marian
has the same powers as Elsa,

16:46.242 --> 16:48.710
maybe they left a trail.

16:48.744 --> 16:52.546
So we split up and we
look for anything... Cold.

16:52.581 --> 16:54.381
[Scoffs] Yeah.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.050
Well, shout if you
need help, and I'll...

16:56.085 --> 16:57.919
okay. Yeah. I got it.

17:02.357 --> 17:04.192
[Clattering]

17:11.299 --> 17:12.766
Whoever's in there, come out.

17:23.944 --> 17:26.733
Who the hell are you? What
are you doing in that tent?

17:26.733 --> 17:27.818
[British accent] It depends who's asking.

17:27.818 --> 17:28.961
The sheriff's asking.

17:29.617 --> 17:31.890
I never did like sheriffs very much.

17:33.381 --> 17:34.651
Though you do seem like the decent sort,

17:34.837 --> 17:38.291
so I'm guessing you're not
gonna shoot a man in the back.

17:50.704 --> 17:51.704
Hey, stop!

17:51.739 --> 17:54.439
[Grunts]

[Grunts]

18:05.585 --> 18:06.685
Where were you going?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.988
I almost had him, but I... Fell.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.656
Don't worry about it. That's
why we have two sheriffs.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.525
Two sheriffs? Bloody hell.
That's not even fair, is it?

18:13.559 --> 18:14.793
Who are you?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.162
All right.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.965
My name's will Scarlet.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.167
I used to be a merry man

18:22.201 --> 18:24.636
until me and Robin Hood
had a bit of a falling out.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.671
So what are you doing in his tent?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.338
Well, I heard what happened to Marian.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.472
Terrible thing.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.975
But I kind of know
something that might help.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.077
Well, he's not here right now, so tell us.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.846
Look, I'm a thief.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.348
Always been a thief,
always gonna be a thief.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.950
And when there's a blackout
like the other night,

18:38.984 --> 18:40.018
do you know what a thief does?

18:40.052 --> 18:42.187
- He goes to work.
- Exactly.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.022
So, I'm working me way down main street

18:45.056 --> 18:46.890
when I break into the ice-cream parlor

18:46.925 --> 18:48.359
and see the strangest thing.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.361
There'd been no electricity for hours,

18:50.395 --> 18:53.030
but still all the ice
cream was frozen solid.

18:53.064 --> 18:56.266
How... how does something
like that happen?

18:56.301 --> 19:00.204
Regina: The curse is working
its way towards her heart.

19:00.238 --> 19:04.041
Once it touches... that's it.

19:04.075 --> 19:06.543
Is there nothing you can do?

19:06.577 --> 19:10.413
[Sighs]

19:10.448 --> 19:14.084
There might be something.

19:14.118 --> 19:16.853
But only if you trust me completely.

19:16.887 --> 19:18.588
I do.

19:18.622 --> 19:22.258
Then I'll send Henry to my
vault to get what I need.

19:22.292 --> 19:25.428
Of course. What are you going to do?

19:25.463 --> 19:28.064
Something drastic.

19:28.098 --> 19:30.467
[Bells jingle]

19:30.501 --> 19:33.516
I must apologize, but I'm
really rather busy today.

19:33.516 --> 19:35.169
And here I was hoping for a warm hello

19:35.169 --> 19:38.407
from the newly-reformed Mr. gold.

19:38.441 --> 19:41.610
This is still a place of business.

19:41.644 --> 19:44.213
So unless you have something to offer me,

19:44.248 --> 19:46.115
I'm afraid I can be of no further help.

19:46.149 --> 19:49.118
Well, as it turns out, I do
have something to offer you...

19:49.152 --> 19:50.686
my silence.

19:53.523 --> 19:56.324
See...

19:56.359 --> 20:01.062
I know that that dagger
you gave Belle was a fake.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.567
- Is that right?
- Mm.

20:06.602 --> 20:08.836
I've hunted you a long
time, my old crocodile,

20:08.871 --> 20:10.638
and I know you better than most.

20:10.672 --> 20:11.973
And I know that you would never

20:12.008 --> 20:14.475
let anyone have power over you.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.912
Not even Belle.

20:16.946 --> 20:20.081
And you expect her to believe you

20:20.116 --> 20:22.683
without a shred of proof?

20:22.718 --> 20:25.185
Well, I could ask her to
summon you with the dagger.

20:25.220 --> 20:27.855
And then, when it doesn't work...

20:27.890 --> 20:30.458
Proof.

20:30.492 --> 20:34.529
That's a very dangerous insinuation.

20:34.563 --> 20:37.698
So we have a deal?

20:37.733 --> 20:40.700
[Sighs]

20:40.735 --> 20:44.038
I do hope miss Swan's worth it.

20:44.072 --> 20:46.873
Good news!

20:46.908 --> 20:49.609
He's agreed to help.

20:53.348 --> 20:55.149
This hair is from Marian.

20:55.183 --> 20:57.183
Someone cast a freezing curse on her.

20:57.217 --> 21:00.487
We need to know who it is.

21:03.257 --> 21:05.892
Well... you're in luck.

21:05.927 --> 21:09.729
Magic can change forms,
but never be destroyed.

21:09.764 --> 21:13.266
We'll simply return it
to its natural state.

21:17.037 --> 21:19.538
[Scoffs] Snowflakes.

21:21.708 --> 21:25.845
Magic similar to yours, dearie,

21:25.879 --> 21:27.713
though not quite the same.

21:27.747 --> 21:31.884
Much like a snowflake, each
person's magic is unique.

21:31.918 --> 21:34.553
Poetic. How does that help us?

21:34.588 --> 21:36.889
Well, magic seeks out like-magic.

21:36.923 --> 21:40.058
So if I set this free...

21:40.093 --> 21:42.027
[Blows]

21:42.061 --> 21:44.697
It should find its way home,

21:44.731 --> 21:48.433
back to the person who cast it.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.884
Come on.

22:02.894 --> 22:03.887
- Ah! [Chuckles]
- Got your hands full.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.325
No, I'm fine. It's just a
little trouble with the stroller.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.459
You know, they...

22:07.483 --> 22:08.860
they make these
contraptions so complicated.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.696
Oh! See?

22:10.730 --> 22:11.964
Ohh.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.198
[Laughs]

22:13.232 --> 22:15.033
I can't imagine how
complicated things must be

22:15.068 --> 22:17.469
with all your new
responsibilities as a mother

22:17.503 --> 22:21.139
and Storybrooke and this whole ice problem.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.308
It's a lot to take on, even for snow white.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.543
Oh, I can handle it. You know, 'cause...

22:25.578 --> 22:28.413
I mean, I want to. They say
that they grow up so fast.

22:28.447 --> 22:31.082
And I don't want to miss a second.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.084
Yeah. Because you missed it with Emma.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.989
I don't remember scheduling a session.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.924
I'm sorry.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.592
Um... I-I just can't help myself.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.729
But, you know, it... it's really okay.

22:44.763 --> 22:48.398
It's actually healthy
to not be joined at the hip.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.900
And I can tell you,

22:49.935 --> 22:53.470
if you let it go, even just a little,

22:53.505 --> 22:56.973
the baby will be just fine.

22:57.008 --> 23:00.277
And you'll be even better. I promise.

23:00.311 --> 23:03.313
[Neal cries]

23:12.857 --> 23:14.457
I don't know. Looks pretty normal to me.

23:14.491 --> 23:16.459
It was bleeding cold in
there, I'm telling you.

23:16.493 --> 23:18.494
Because they sell ice
cream. During the blackout.

23:18.529 --> 23:20.163
Says the guy who's trying to avoid jail.

23:20.197 --> 23:21.731
I may be a thief, but I'm no liar

23:21.766 --> 23:23.266
and I can bloody well prove it.

23:25.569 --> 23:28.437
Really? You think breaking in
again is gonna help your case?

23:28.472 --> 23:29.705
Can you just be quiet a second, mate?

23:29.739 --> 23:31.807
I'm just trying to do
this. Takes concentration.

23:31.841 --> 23:33.609
Bit tricky.

23:33.644 --> 23:35.378
It's all about... yeah, the tumblers.

23:35.412 --> 23:36.546
I got it.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.548
You do?

23:38.582 --> 23:39.815
[Sighs]

23:39.849 --> 23:41.984
Neal taught me a few things.

23:42.018 --> 23:43.286
[Bells jingle]

23:48.158 --> 23:49.524
[Door closes]

23:49.559 --> 23:50.726
Emma, it doesn't look like...

23:50.760 --> 23:52.294
wait. Shh. Listen.

23:52.328 --> 23:54.529
I don't hear nothing.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.364
Exactly.

23:56.399 --> 23:58.667
No compressor hum
means no cooling system.

23:58.702 --> 24:00.669
Smartass here was telling the truth.

24:00.704 --> 24:02.304
Something's not right here.

24:02.338 --> 24:04.839
Check the back. You'll see how right I am.

24:12.881 --> 24:14.349
Well, look at that.

24:14.383 --> 24:17.352
Looks like we owe will an apology.

24:17.386 --> 24:20.354
[Bells jingle]

24:20.388 --> 24:22.156
Son of a...

24:26.729 --> 24:29.931
He's gone. And he didn't
leave empty-handed.

24:29.965 --> 24:31.699
Emma, stop. He's not the most
important thing right now.

24:31.734 --> 24:33.400
So I just let him go?
And then you'll find him.

24:33.435 --> 24:34.736
Will I?

24:34.770 --> 24:36.837
What's going on?

24:36.871 --> 24:39.340
Emma, I'm your father.

24:39.374 --> 24:40.574
- Talk to me.
- It's Regina.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.908
What she said, she was right.

24:41.943 --> 24:44.010
It's like I can't save a
cat from a tree right now.

24:44.045 --> 24:45.379
It's like I'm the anti-savior.

24:45.413 --> 24:46.714
You're being a little hard on yourself.

24:46.748 --> 24:48.115
We all have bad days.

24:48.149 --> 24:50.050
Well, I'm having a run of them.

24:50.084 --> 24:51.385
I know.

24:51.419 --> 24:53.720
But you can't lose faith in yourself.

24:53.755 --> 24:55.155
Trust me.

24:57.725 --> 25:00.160
[Whoosh]

25:02.163 --> 25:03.830
What are you doing?

25:04.766 --> 25:05.899
Leaving a trail.

25:05.933 --> 25:07.567
I'm more accustomed to
outrunning bad weather

25:07.601 --> 25:09.068
than following it.

25:09.102 --> 25:12.204
Snow isn't bad. And we're following magic.

25:12.239 --> 25:14.807
Try to outrun that, too,
when given the chance.

25:14.841 --> 25:15.808
[Chuckles]

25:15.842 --> 25:17.644
What's so funny?

25:17.678 --> 25:19.312
It's just Emma has magic,

25:19.346 --> 25:21.648
and you clearly don't want to outrun her.

25:21.682 --> 25:23.983
More like the other way around.

25:24.017 --> 25:26.152
Maybe she feels the same way about pirates

25:26.186 --> 25:27.820
as you do about magic.

25:27.854 --> 25:29.488
I've worked to change.

25:29.522 --> 25:30.856
Though, in fairness, being a pirate

25:30.891 --> 25:32.124
is not necessarily a bad thing.

25:32.159 --> 25:34.960
Particularly a charming one like meself.

25:34.995 --> 25:37.562
I think your self-appreciation
is blinding you

25:37.597 --> 25:39.899
to a simple fact...
this isn't about you.

25:39.933 --> 25:42.233
- It's about her.
- Is that right?

25:42.268 --> 25:45.304
A few short days,
and you know Emma so well?

25:45.338 --> 25:46.638
We're a lot alike.

25:46.673 --> 25:48.973
When you have the weight of
the world on your shoulders,

25:49.008 --> 25:50.442
it can be hard to let people in,

25:50.476 --> 25:52.110
to trust them.

25:52.144 --> 25:54.078
Even when they want what's best for you.

26:00.786 --> 26:01.886
There's the urn.

26:03.289 --> 26:04.588
[Chuckles] See?

26:04.623 --> 26:08.092
I told you we could beat
hans the old-fashioned way.

26:08.127 --> 26:09.694
Now let's destroy it.

26:09.728 --> 26:11.529
Do you mind if I use my magic now?

26:11.563 --> 26:15.366
Or would you prefer to hack
away at it with your ice-axe?

26:15.400 --> 26:17.034
[Scoffs] You know,
my hacking arm's a little tired.

26:17.068 --> 26:18.969
I think you should do
the honors, your majesty.

26:19.003 --> 26:21.472
Why, thank you, ice master.

26:30.315 --> 26:32.482
[Crackles]

26:32.516 --> 26:33.984
Wait.

26:34.018 --> 26:37.154
[Scoffs] There's something written here.

26:37.188 --> 26:40.824
I think these are ancient Futhark runes.

26:40.859 --> 26:43.493
I can't read it.
What do you think it says?

26:43.527 --> 26:45.929
Uh... "Dangerous urn! Keep away!"

26:46.731 --> 26:48.365
Just a guess. Does it matter?

26:48.399 --> 26:50.367
Let's destroy it and get out of here.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.268
What if it can tell me if
there are others like me?

26:52.302 --> 26:54.036
I'm the only one in my
family born with magic.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.204
I'd like to know why.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.639
Elsa, I know you want answers.

26:56.674 --> 26:59.576
But right now we can get rid
of that urn for your own good,

26:59.610 --> 27:00.577
and Arendelle's.

27:00.611 --> 27:02.912
I want to know what it says.

27:02.946 --> 27:04.480
I might not get another chance.

27:04.514 --> 27:05.848
Please, Elsa, you have
to trust me on this...

27:05.883 --> 27:07.549
no!

27:07.584 --> 27:08.885
[Footsteps approach]

27:08.919 --> 27:10.353
Someone's coming.

27:11.889 --> 27:13.522
Hans.

27:13.556 --> 27:14.891
And his brothers.

27:15.859 --> 27:17.826
Three of them, anyway. The urn.

27:18.695 --> 27:20.496
Get it.

27:21.631 --> 27:22.765
[Whoosh]

27:22.799 --> 27:24.466
[Ice crackling]

27:27.604 --> 27:29.805
[Breathing heavily]

27:38.981 --> 27:41.283
Enough, witch.

27:41.317 --> 27:44.619
Unless you want your
sister to be left a widow.

27:44.653 --> 27:46.540
You know, technically,
she wouldn't be a widow.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.024
We're not married yet, so... ow.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.227
Hand it over.

27:53.995 --> 27:55.730
Now.

28:07.443 --> 28:10.625
- I'd say we're on the right track.
- Yes.

28:12.745 --> 28:14.612
There she is.

28:14.646 --> 28:16.581
- Look.
- Get down.

28:22.087 --> 28:24.555
What is that thing? [Beep]

28:24.590 --> 28:26.890
[Sighs] I don't know.
It's a device for... Talking.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.058
I don't bloody know.

28:28.093 --> 28:30.560
I press the "Emma" button,
and she answers usually.

28:30.595 --> 28:32.629
[Beep]

28:32.663 --> 28:35.465
[Sighs] [Ringing]

28:35.499 --> 28:37.467
<i>- Emma: Hey, this is Emma. Leave a message.
- [Beep]</i>

28:37.501 --> 28:39.803
Why should I carry
around this ridiculous thing

28:39.838 --> 28:42.639
if you're never there when I use it?

28:42.673 --> 28:44.108
We found the person who froze Marian.

28:44.142 --> 28:46.309
Get to the west edge
of the woods right away.

28:46.344 --> 28:47.238
What the bloody hell are you doing?

28:47.382 --> 28:50.617
Sorry. I've never seen
someone like me before.

28:51.852 --> 28:52.886
She doesn't look evil.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.721
Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving, love.

28:54.755 --> 28:55.960
So let's just stay out of sight.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.794
I haven't a fondness of icebergs

28:57.829 --> 28:59.930
and I'd rather avoid being turned into one.

28:59.964 --> 29:01.298
[Sighs]

29:02.800 --> 29:06.202
This is the man she's to marry?

29:06.236 --> 29:07.870
[Scoffs] In fairness,
I never tried to kill her.

29:07.904 --> 29:10.707
I didn't try to kill
her. I left her to die.

29:10.741 --> 29:12.408
Important distinction.

29:12.443 --> 29:14.744
But I'm happy to kill you.

29:14.778 --> 29:16.346
Please, no! Don't hurt him.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.113
Then give me the urn.

29:18.148 --> 29:20.349
Elsa, don't.

29:20.383 --> 29:21.917
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

29:21.952 --> 29:23.018
Just don't let him have it.

29:24.254 --> 29:25.420
Wait.

29:25.455 --> 29:27.756
You can take it. Just let him go.

29:27.790 --> 29:29.358
Elsa!

29:29.392 --> 29:30.359
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.194
I should have listened to you

29:32.229 --> 29:34.063
and destroyed it when I had the chance.

29:34.097 --> 29:35.164
Don't you understand?

29:35.198 --> 29:36.965
If hans has the urn and traps you,

29:36.999 --> 29:38.233
then Arendelle is doomed.

29:38.267 --> 29:39.234
No, it isn't.

29:39.268 --> 29:40.235
I didn't trust you before,

29:40.269 --> 29:41.803
which is why I have to trust you now.

29:41.838 --> 29:45.574
You have to find Anna and save Arendelle.

29:59.454 --> 30:01.089
[Chuckles]

30:01.123 --> 30:03.391
Huh?

30:03.425 --> 30:05.927
Oh, you want to make fun of me now?

30:07.796 --> 30:09.430
Showed them.

30:09.464 --> 30:10.765
Now I'll show you.

30:10.799 --> 30:12.833
You don't belong in this world.

30:12.868 --> 30:14.968
You don't belong anywhere.

30:15.003 --> 30:16.937
Which is why I'm gonna put you somewhere

30:16.971 --> 30:18.773
where it's like you don't even exist.

30:18.807 --> 30:19.874
[Exhales sharply]

30:29.784 --> 30:33.686
The citizens of Arendelle will
cheer when I take their kingdom

30:33.721 --> 30:35.555
because they'll finally have a real ruler.

30:38.726 --> 30:41.761
Not a monster like you.

31:11.224 --> 31:14.226
No one thought to check if it was empty?

31:14.261 --> 31:15.828
What's going on? Who are you?

31:15.862 --> 31:16.995
Hmm, from what I just heard,

31:17.029 --> 31:19.364
I think you'd call me a monster.

31:19.398 --> 31:21.099
[Whoosh]

31:33.912 --> 31:35.913
You...

31:35.948 --> 31:38.483
You saved me.

31:38.517 --> 31:40.818
I know from experience.

31:40.853 --> 31:42.988
No one should be trapped in that urn.

31:43.022 --> 31:46.024
Especially someone as special as you.

31:47.093 --> 31:48.058
Who is this?

31:48.093 --> 31:49.894
It's okay. He's okay.

31:49.928 --> 31:54.799
His name's Kristoff. He's my friend.

32:00.539 --> 32:03.674
We've waited long enough.
We have to find Emma.

32:06.277 --> 32:07.577
[Whoosh]

32:07.612 --> 32:09.413
[Grunts]

32:09.447 --> 32:11.315
Snow queen: I'm sorry.

32:13.418 --> 32:15.285
I'm afraid I can't let you leave.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.786
What?

32:16.821 --> 32:19.023
Let go of him now.

32:19.057 --> 32:21.758
Not when you and I have
so much catching up to do,

32:21.792 --> 32:24.528
my sweet Elsa.

32:24.562 --> 32:26.730
Catching up? What? You know her?

32:26.764 --> 32:28.698
I've never seen her before.

32:28.733 --> 32:30.266
You've simply forgotten.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.769
I wouldn't forget someone like you.

32:32.803 --> 32:35.038
Like me.

32:35.072 --> 32:39.542
The magic of the rock
trolls. They pull memories.

32:39.576 --> 32:42.378
They did quite a number on you, I'm afraid.

32:42.413 --> 32:45.314
The rock trolls? Why
would they do that to me?

32:45.349 --> 32:48.817
For the same reason they
did it to your sister, Anna.

32:48.852 --> 32:50.619
Some memories are too painful.

32:50.654 --> 32:53.222
You know Anna? What happened to her?

32:53.257 --> 32:56.224
The same things that happens
to every ordinary person.

32:56.259 --> 33:00.128
Eventually... they grow to fear us.

33:00.163 --> 33:03.465
You wonder...

33:03.499 --> 33:07.235
How you ended up trapped in that urn.

33:07.270 --> 33:08.604
It was your sister.

33:10.373 --> 33:12.407
Anna put you there.

33:12.442 --> 33:13.641
You're lying.

33:13.676 --> 33:15.977
Am I? Look at the people in this town.

33:16.011 --> 33:17.479
They're ready to burn you at the stake.

33:17.513 --> 33:19.647
Because of what you did.
You hurt one of them.

33:19.682 --> 33:22.917
You mean that woman... Marian.

33:22.952 --> 33:25.587
Well, that was an accident.

33:25.621 --> 33:27.254
No, it wasn't.

33:27.289 --> 33:29.924
You wanted them to think
it was me. To blame me.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.292
Why?

33:31.326 --> 33:36.297
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

33:36.331 --> 33:41.102
Eventually, everyone
turns on people like us.

33:41.136 --> 33:43.137
Even friends.

33:43.171 --> 33:45.772
Even family.

33:45.807 --> 33:47.108
They're just waiting for a reason.

33:47.142 --> 33:48.275
[Ice crackles] What are you doing?!

33:50.472 --> 33:51.528
Don't bother.

33:51.711 --> 33:55.616
- I've neutralized your magic.
- [Grunting]

33:55.650 --> 33:58.619
When your friend is found,
you'll look responsible.

33:58.653 --> 34:00.954
Then they'll turn on you

34:00.989 --> 34:02.388
and they'll treat you as the monster

34:02.423 --> 34:05.325
that they truly see you as,
and you'll know that I'm right.

34:05.359 --> 34:07.794
- No!
- Hey! Dairy queen!

34:09.764 --> 34:11.965
Emma?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.034
Do we know each other?

34:14.068 --> 34:16.869
Of course not.

34:16.902 --> 34:19.772
Your reputation precedes you.

34:21.775 --> 34:24.511
You really think that your
magic is a match for mine?

34:24.545 --> 34:26.179
There's only one way to find out.

34:26.213 --> 34:27.679
[Whoosh]

34:30.518 --> 34:31.751
[Ice cracking]

34:31.784 --> 34:33.152
No.

34:33.186 --> 34:35.554
[Ice crackling]

34:35.588 --> 34:36.722
[Whoosh]

34:37.556 --> 34:39.025
- [Whoosh]
- [Both grunt]

34:41.226 --> 34:42.895
You guys okay?

34:42.929 --> 34:45.731
Yeah, we're fine.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.699
Where is she?

34:51.638 --> 34:53.272
She's gone.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.474
[Panting]

34:58.357 --> 35:00.804
Have you ever made a snowman
come to life? That's the best.

35:00.804 --> 35:02.403
Have you tried building an ice palace yet?

35:02.551 --> 35:04.419
Yes. You have to see it sometime.

35:04.453 --> 35:06.755
[Giggles]

35:06.789 --> 35:08.790
Oh.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.900
That's my favorite painting of my parents.

35:20.402 --> 35:24.205
I feel like it gets my
mother's smile just right.

35:25.908 --> 35:29.276
I agree.

35:29.311 --> 35:31.077
You knew her?

35:31.112 --> 35:33.580
Yes.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.718
She's my sister.

35:37.752 --> 35:42.289
I knew, when you told me
you were queen, that I...

35:42.324 --> 35:45.625
I was waiting for the right moment.

35:45.659 --> 35:47.794
I-I-I didn't want
to overwhelm you.

35:47.829 --> 35:49.196
Did... did I?

35:49.230 --> 35:51.198
No, I...

35:51.232 --> 35:53.366
Well, a bit, yes.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.203
Mother never told me she had a sister.

35:58.272 --> 36:01.907
I'm sure she was trying to
spare you a very painful history.

36:01.942 --> 36:04.577
Y-you see I was
trapped in that urn

36:04.611 --> 36:08.815
by people who fear magic like ours.

36:08.849 --> 36:10.483
But that was a long time ago.

36:10.517 --> 36:14.721
And now I cannot wait to
see my beloved sister again.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.056
Where is she?

36:17.090 --> 36:20.492
Lost at sea. I'm sorry.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.828
My poor darling girl.

36:22.863 --> 36:26.232
You must have felt so lonely when she died.

36:26.266 --> 36:30.069
It was just me and my sister, Anna.

36:30.103 --> 36:31.403
But now she's missing

36:31.437 --> 36:34.138
and I fear something's
happened to her, too.

36:34.173 --> 36:37.409
We'll find her. Together.

36:37.443 --> 36:41.813
That's what family is for.

36:45.718 --> 36:49.521
[Sighs] No sign of her. Not even tracks.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.155
What is it? You okay?

36:52.858 --> 36:55.526
Hey, we're gonna find her. Don't
let Regina shake your confidence.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.861
It's not that. It's this snow queen.

36:56.896 --> 36:58.596
It's like she didn't just
know Elsa. She knew me, too.

36:58.630 --> 37:00.765
Well, you are the sheriff
and the savior and royalty.

37:00.799 --> 37:03.268
I think pretty much everyone in
Storybrooke knows who you are.

37:03.302 --> 37:05.436
[Sighs] There's something more.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.271
It's like, when she said
my name, I-I-I don't know.

37:07.305 --> 37:08.873
It sounded familiar.

37:08.907 --> 37:12.342
Well, we'll figure it out.
But today you did good.

37:12.377 --> 37:14.144
You stopped her.

37:14.178 --> 37:15.446
It was a pretty impressive show, sheriff.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.547
Killian: That it was.

37:16.581 --> 37:18.048
But perhaps we should keep searching,

37:18.082 --> 37:19.550
find the villain's lair, as it were.

37:19.584 --> 37:21.552
So you can almost get
yourself killed again?

37:21.586 --> 37:24.254
That's exactly why I told you
to go to the sheriff's station.

37:25.056 --> 37:26.323
[Sighs]

37:26.357 --> 37:28.825
How are you doing?

37:28.859 --> 37:30.460
That woman was lying about my sister.

37:30.494 --> 37:33.463
She would never trap me in that urn.

37:33.497 --> 37:35.165
She was lying about the past.

37:35.199 --> 37:36.866
I just wish I knew the truth.

37:36.901 --> 37:39.536
I've learned the past has
a way of revealing itself.

37:39.570 --> 37:40.537
Give it time.

37:40.571 --> 37:42.472
We're gonna find her, Elsa.

37:42.506 --> 37:44.974
Your sister, Anna, and this snow queen.

37:45.008 --> 37:46.976
My gut tells me that
you two are just pawns.

37:47.010 --> 37:48.711
I think this is about something more.

37:48.746 --> 37:50.346
What makes you say that?

37:50.380 --> 37:53.683
I brought you to this world,
Elsa, but it was an accident.

37:53.717 --> 37:57.019
The snow queen, she was already here.

37:57.054 --> 38:00.189
I'm starting to think maybe
it wasn't just some curse

38:00.223 --> 38:01.723
that brought her to Storybrooke.

38:03.526 --> 38:05.828
[Door opens]

38:06.729 --> 38:09.031
[Sighs]

38:09.066 --> 38:10.532
Roland's with little John now.

38:11.901 --> 38:14.903
I wish I could have told
him I did everything I could.

38:14.938 --> 38:16.037
[Sighs]

38:16.072 --> 38:18.774
Even true love's kiss
can't solve every problem.

38:18.808 --> 38:22.778
Well, there's a reason
that kiss didn't work.

38:22.812 --> 38:24.913
And it's not what everyone thinks.

38:26.415 --> 38:29.384
I'm in love with someone else.

38:34.590 --> 38:37.892
[Scoffs] You are?

38:37.926 --> 38:41.262
Yes. But...

38:41.297 --> 38:43.398
I know.

38:43.432 --> 38:47.234
I know you... have to go back to her.

38:47.268 --> 38:48.769
She's still your wife.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.271
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

38:51.306 --> 38:54.108
[Footsteps approach]

38:54.142 --> 38:57.111
You really need to clean that vault out.

38:57.145 --> 38:59.380
But I found it.

39:02.350 --> 39:04.985
You're sure you still want me to do this?

39:05.020 --> 39:07.221
Yes.

39:11.259 --> 39:13.860
[Inhales deeply]

39:20.801 --> 39:22.301
[Grunts]

39:22.336 --> 39:24.137
[Exhales sharply] [Heart beating]

39:25.305 --> 39:27.273
[Sighs]

39:27.307 --> 39:31.110
Well, the ice hasn't touched her heart yet.

39:31.145 --> 39:33.146
We can keep her alive.

39:33.180 --> 39:37.616
So, then, she'll simply stay like this?

39:37.651 --> 39:40.453
Alive but... Frozen?

39:40.487 --> 39:42.922
Until we find a cure.

39:44.224 --> 39:46.292
And I will find one.

39:48.395 --> 39:49.595
[Bells jingle]

39:51.465 --> 39:54.266
Swan. Don't make a man drink alone.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.868
Not in the mood for a drink or a man.

39:55.902 --> 39:57.870
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you today.

39:57.904 --> 39:59.237
All right, I know you feel like

39:59.272 --> 40:00.639
you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.975
But at some point, even
though we're quite different,

40:03.009 --> 40:04.610
you've got to trust me.

40:04.644 --> 40:06.645
That's what you think this is
about? That I don't trust you?

40:06.680 --> 40:07.780
Is that not what it's about?

40:07.814 --> 40:09.514
Of course I trust you.

40:09.549 --> 40:10.848
Then why do you keep pulling away from me?

40:10.883 --> 40:12.917
Because everyone I've
ever been with is dead.

40:16.422 --> 40:18.890
Neal and Graham.

40:18.924 --> 40:20.258
Even Walsh.

40:21.994 --> 40:23.628
I lost everyone.

40:23.662 --> 40:28.466
I... I can't lose you, too.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.169
Well, love, you don't
have to worry about me.

40:34.239 --> 40:39.611
If there's one thing
I'm good at, it's surviving.

41:14.478 --> 41:16.613
Don't worry, dearie.

41:16.647 --> 41:19.349
It's only me.

41:19.383 --> 41:23.253
Sorry things didn't work
out the way you wanted.

41:23.287 --> 41:25.788
They will.

41:25.822 --> 41:28.658
We shall see.

41:30.727 --> 41:34.363
And, uh...

41:34.397 --> 41:39.234
Did miss Swan remember you?

41:39.269 --> 41:41.937
No.

41:41.972 --> 41:44.606
That's good for you.

41:44.641 --> 41:47.076
Because it could happen.

41:47.110 --> 41:49.878
And you wouldn't want that, now, would you?

41:51.814 --> 41:54.983
Are you sure you don't want my help?

41:55.017 --> 41:58.587
When I'm ready to make
a deal, I'll come to you.

41:58.621 --> 42:03.325
A moment I eagerly await.

42:03.359 --> 42:06.895
Now, you should find some shelter.

42:06.929 --> 42:10.197
It's getting quite frosty.
