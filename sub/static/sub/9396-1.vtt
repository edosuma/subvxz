00:02.001 --> 00:03.731
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:03.803 --> 00:07.500
<i>Look, I've got an opening in my lineup.</i>
<i>Varsity. What do you say?</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:10.805
If this new kid's taking your position,
he's no longer your teammate.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.539
-He's your opponent.
<i>-I can describe Lucas in one word.</i>

00:13.613 --> 00:15.137
Bastard.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.474
So what if he wins? What does he get?

00:17.550 --> 00:19.643
-He gets you.
<i>-Lucas.</i>

00:19.719 --> 00:21.653
<i>I don't know what hurts worse.</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:24.550
<i>You and Lucas sneaking around</i>
<i>behind my back.</i>

00:24.624 --> 00:26.387
Or you lying about it to my face.

00:26.459 --> 00:27.858
<i>lf I could just get up...</i>

00:27.927 --> 00:31.158
I'd walk over to you
and I'd tell you how much I need you.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.695
-Haley.
-It's okay.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.295
<i>No, that's just like him!</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:42.273
To get you branded with his jersey number
right above your ass.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.775
He doesn't even know about it.

00:43.843 --> 00:47.108
You have no right to think of him,
not today or any other day.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.306
How dare you.

00:48.381 --> 00:52.010
<i>lf you weren't helping your friend Karen,</i>
<i>you might have been there for him.</i>

00:52.085 --> 00:53.143
I need a doctor!

00:53.219 --> 00:56.780
I want you out of this house,
or I will stab you in your sleep.

00:56.856 --> 00:59.290
<i>-You're his legal guardian?</i>
-He's my son.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.384
<i>Were you drinking before</i>
<i>you drove Lucas?</i>

01:01.461 --> 01:03.793
-Yes.
-I want you to leave.

01:03.863 --> 01:06.127
Were you serious about
wanting to get out of here?

01:06.199 --> 01:08.360
<i>I've got a way,</i>
<i>but you'd have to leave tomorrow.</i>

01:08.435 --> 01:12.303
-I asked you if you had a problem.
-Yeah, I do. It's called you, bitch.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.269
Keith!

01:20.180 --> 01:22.808
They handed me the consent forms.
He needed surgery.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.215
-You have a right to be upset, but--
-Thank you.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.049
I need to talk to you.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.621
-Okay.
-I think I'm pregnant.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.453
-I love you, Karen.
-Keith.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.654
Marry me.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.390
I thought you weren't ready.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.524
I thought you were gonna
wait till you got married.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.828
I did wait.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.096
What are you talking about, Haley?

01:45.805 --> 01:47.500
We got married last night.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.441
Mom, I want to leave Tree Hill.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

03:37.650 --> 03:39.618
You killed me, you bitch.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.140
Hey, you.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.374
Hi.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.382
I had the strangest dream.

04:15.154 --> 04:18.248
I dreamt we actually got married
yesterday.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.586
That's weird.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.956
-I had the same dream.
-No.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.129
That's right.

04:30.837 --> 04:34.068
-We actually did get married.
-We did get married.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.703
Pretty wild, huh?

04:39.512 --> 04:42.879
-How do you feel?
-I was just watching you sleep, thinking:

04:44.083 --> 04:46.643
-''Let's always be like this.''
-Yeah.

04:50.156 --> 04:52.488
Then I turned my cell phone back on.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.724
It's my mom. She's been calling like crazy.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.400
Do you think she found out about us?

05:02.468 --> 05:05.062
No. She probably just wants her car back.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.271
In that case, don't worry about it.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.832
Give me that.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.024
Holy cow.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.995
What happened to your head?

05:34.400 --> 05:38.632
-I figured new town, new look.
-Okay. Whatever you say, Felicity.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.237
At least the town looks nice.

05:41.307 --> 05:42.934
Yeah, it does.

05:43.743 --> 05:47.076
-I think we're gonna like it here.
-Yeah.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.882
You know, not many people get a chance
just to start over, you know.

05:52.085 --> 05:55.054
I mean, just leave Tree Hill
and reinvent themselves.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.388
And it all starts today.

05:57.824 --> 05:58.848
Yeah.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.257
Hello.

06:55.848 --> 06:56.974
Hey, girl.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.318
Doesn't anyone ring the doorbell
in this town?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.751
Some do. I don't.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.888
-Let's go.
-And where are we going?

07:03.956 --> 07:07.653
It is day two of the Brooke and Peyton
hos over bros reunion tour.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.110
Come on, you fake-blonde Goldilocks,
let's go!

07:43.296 --> 07:45.025
Bad news?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.360
My dad's in the hospital.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.662
-He had a heart attack.
-No. Is he gonna be okay?

07:51.737 --> 07:54.570
I don't know.
My mom just left it on my voicemail.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.474
-I'm sorry, Nathan.
-Yeah. I've got to go see him.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.139
Yeah, I'll go with you.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.310
Nathan.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.144
Maybe we shouldn't tell them
about us yet.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.087
I mean, maybe we should just wait
until he recovers.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.487
-They're gonna find out, Haley.
-I know.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.788
It's just that I saw your dad
before the game...

08:14.861 --> 08:16.829
and he wasn't happy about us dating.

08:16.896 --> 08:20.127
-What's he gonna say now?
-It's not about him.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.829
We're married now, Haley.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.067
I'm never gonna hide that.

08:30.042 --> 08:33.135
-Brooke, what are you up to?
-You've been on my dad's boat before.

08:33.212 --> 08:37.273
-Yeah, with you and your dad.
-Details. It's like driving a car...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.909
just on water and without a speed limit.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.921
Peyton, look at us. Look at this day.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.584
We are practically a beer commercial.
It would be wrong not to take it.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.921
So let's go.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.664
Hop on, bestest friend.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.984
Is it normal for him
to be unconscious like this?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.586
Yes and no. Your husband is sedated...

09:20.660 --> 09:22.560
from the angioplasty.

09:23.229 --> 09:27.393
But he suffered major heart failure.
He could be unconscious for a while yet.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.831
Would it have mattered
if I had found him sooner?

09:33.906 --> 09:36.306
In medicine, earlier is always better.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.501
But you called as soon as you could, right?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.047
Dan.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.819
Dan, can you hear me?

09:54.360 --> 09:55.759
-Deb.
-What?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.730
You better hope I die.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.365
You're threatening me?

10:06.639 --> 10:07.628
Here.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.001
Dial it yourself.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.032
Deb.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.438
You know, I came here to apologize.
To tell you I was sorry.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.043
Even though you've basically been
the assiest ass on the planet...

10:20.119 --> 10:22.519
for the better part of our married lives.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.557
-What are you doing?
-I'm considering, Dan.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.286
Please.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.856
Help me.

10:39.705 --> 10:40.694
Dan.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.615
I'm sorry.

11:03.262 --> 11:04.593
Keith.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.155
Jeez, who died?

11:08.567 --> 11:11.365
It's Dan. He had a heart attack.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.044
Haley, have you seen my gray T-shirt?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.387
<i>I want to do something, okay.</i>

11:37.897 --> 11:38.886
Haley....

11:39.832 --> 11:41.322
No, it's okay.

11:58.651 --> 12:02.246
-I could love you forever.
-So could I.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.588
You're my family now, Haley.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.990
The only true thing I have.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.031
I never want to lose you.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.031
You won't.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.465
What?

12:24.410 --> 12:25.536
Marry me.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.770
-Stop it.
-What? Would you?

12:29.849 --> 12:32.147
-You're embarrassing me.
-Why not?

12:33.986 --> 12:36.614
Because we're in high school.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.623
So what? I'm emancipated.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.024
Is this about sex? Because I want to wait?

12:42.094 --> 12:44.790
No. I could see you caving
on that one already.

12:45.364 --> 12:46.695
Maybe so.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.470
Nathan, couples don't get married
in high school.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.301
-It's not normal.
-So? I'm not normal.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.442
What I'm feeling is definitely not normal.

12:58.077 --> 13:01.638
And to be honest with you, Haley,
I don't ever want to be normal.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.846
Not with you.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.518
I'm serious.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.519
I know you are.

13:10.589 --> 13:14.548
Okay, so I'll say it again:
I could love you forever.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.856
-Nathan, so could I, but....
-So why can't forever start today?

13:30.609 --> 13:33.305
Do I have a view like this in Tree Hill?

13:36.348 --> 13:38.179
You want to talk about Dan?

13:38.884 --> 13:40.681
Do you think my mom knows?

13:41.587 --> 13:43.054
I don't know.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.289
-Think she cares?
-Do you?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.131
You know, Luke...

13:54.266 --> 13:56.097
Dan's your birth father.

13:57.736 --> 14:01.638
Even though he's never been in your life
it wouldn't be wrong to be concerned.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.868
Would it be wrong to hope he dies?

14:09.315 --> 14:12.148
Dan has a heart condition known as HCM.

14:12.218 --> 14:16.587
It's a genetic mutation
that causes the heart muscles to thicken.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.814
Eventually, it prevents the heart
from pumping blood.

14:19.892 --> 14:20.984
But why now?

14:21.060 --> 14:25.929
Sometimes cardiac arrest is brought on
by excessive physical activity...

14:26.232 --> 14:27.927
even excessive stress.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.798
I've made so many mistakes, Deb.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.871
With you and with Nathan.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.042
But I'm willing to change.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.043
I'll do anything.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.343
I'll do everything to keep you in my life.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.550
I'm not proud of who I've been.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.063
But don't give up on me...

15:00.099 --> 15:01.930
because I still love you.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.205
Coach Durham.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.171
Karen.

15:50.015 --> 15:53.473
I always pretend to be asleep
when the nurse comes in here.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.514
She looks a lot like Death...

15:57.122 --> 15:58.749
only uglier.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.924
How are you doing?

16:00.993 --> 16:03.393
You know, they want to operate.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.792
But it's a long story,
full of all kinds of medical mumbo jumbo.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.191
I've got lots of time.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.928
I closed the cafe for the day.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.775
I guess your nest is
feeling pretty empty, huh?

16:20.546 --> 16:21.911
I guess so.

16:22.348 --> 16:25.283
You ever think
maybe that's what Lucas wanted?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.210
That silence would close in on you...

16:28.287 --> 16:31.313
and you'd have to go out
and make some noise yourself?

16:33.192 --> 16:36.320
I was thinking
that maybe I'd take some classes...

16:36.395 --> 16:37.862
over at the university.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.660
Stop thinking about it, damn it, and do it.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.500
You know what I'd do if I was your age?

16:45.971 --> 16:47.336
Everything.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.700
And then, by golly,
I'd turn around and do it again.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.768
I wouldn't give a rat's ass
who disapproved...

16:53.846 --> 16:56.007
or what I looked like doing it.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.378
Karen.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.181
Take it from me.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.326
When you're my age,
you don't want to be here...

17:11.563 --> 17:14.464
tangled up in that road you never traveled.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.959
Make some time.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.666
Take a few chances.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.645
-Listen, you hear that?
-Hear what?

17:35.154 --> 17:38.317
-Silence. It's nice.
-Yeah.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.559
At least it was until you started talking.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.596
So what do you want to do after this?

17:45.664 --> 17:49.327
Maybe some ice cream, or lingerie,
a facial.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.335
It's okay to miss him, Brooke.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.272
-Miss who?
-Lucas.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.475
I don't miss him.

17:59.244 --> 18:02.873
Really, I mean, maybe a little,
you know, now that he moved...

18:03.782 --> 18:07.377
but whatever. There's other fish in the sea.
We'll find new boyfriends.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.513
It shouldn't be hard
considering you're you and I'm me.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.716
Yeah. His loss.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.757
Jake's, too.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.256
You want to know a secret?

18:18.997 --> 18:21.363
I was secretly pulling for you and Jake.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.695
Even when I was at the top
of your bitch list?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.965
-Even then. You know why?
-Why?

18:27.039 --> 18:28.836
Because I wasn't into him.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.344
Stop!

18:45.891 --> 18:47.552
Boys are so easy.

18:49.661 --> 18:52.562
We could swim if we had suits.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.124
When has that ever stopped us?

19:11.817 --> 19:15.116
You gonna give me a hand
or are you gonna live in the truck?

19:15.354 --> 19:17.151
It just seems like a waste.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.352
We're going back, right?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.553
Why? Are you a heart surgeon?

19:26.231 --> 19:27.596
Look, Luke...

19:28.600 --> 19:32.195
I want Dan to get better, too.
I'm really pulling for him.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.998
But, you know, my future's here now.
I can't just go back.

19:36.308 --> 19:39.141
I get it. I don't want to go back either...

19:40.245 --> 19:42.213
but it just doesn't feel right.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.670
Okay.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.249
AII right, I'll tell you what.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.752
Give me your reasons to stay.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.017
Keith.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.291
No, I'm serious.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.227
We'll make a list.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.528
Give me one reason
why you don't want to go back.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.195
Dan.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.436
Yeah, Dan. Dan's an ass. That's good.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.810
What else?

20:16.915 --> 20:19.110
I screwed up with Brooke and Peyton.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.316
I didn't even say goodbye.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.884
There was so much to say,
and I just wrote it in a letter.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.786
-Having fun, P. Sawyer?
-Hell, yes, B. Davis.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.793
-You?
-Yeah.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.957
But I'm thinking about Lucas.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.024
It's not that he left.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.230
It's kind of how he left.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.167
I just can't believe
he didn't even say goodbye.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.901
Brooke, there's something
I need to show you.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.411
It was taped to my front door yesterday.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.445
This is from Lucas.

20:55.787 --> 20:59.314
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hid it from you.
-But you did.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.450
I've been carrying around
that he left without a word.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.121
-You had the words and didn't tell me?
-I was going to.

21:05.197 --> 21:09.156
-When? After you read it first?
-No. I wouldn't do that. I promise.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.934
Whatever, Peyton. We should head back.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.608
Listen, Haley, if you want,
I can do this alone.

21:24.683 --> 21:28.585
-You don't have to come in.
-No, I'm okay. I want to.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.587
Good. I was hoping you'd say that.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.415
Besides, we stuck together
with my parents.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.428
Anybody home?

21:39.331 --> 21:40.628
Mom, Dad?

21:41.266 --> 21:42.858
In the kitchen, Haley.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.940
No matter what happens next,
I want you to know...

21:53.145 --> 21:54.976
if my parents say yes...

21:55.881 --> 21:57.246
I would marry you.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.884
Okay? Yeah, I would.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.817
-Mom?
-Hey, baby.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.357
Don't just stand there, give me a hug.

22:12.564 --> 22:15.158
-You must be Nathan. I'm Marion.
-Hi.

22:18.136 --> 22:20.627
-Is my mom here?
-She's around here somewhere.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.537
Here's that article, Marion.

22:23.942 --> 22:26.968
How someone can actually type
with their head up their ass...

22:27.045 --> 22:28.672
is beyond me.

22:30.716 --> 22:31.910
Nathan.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.418
Did you climb
through Haley's window again...

22:34.486 --> 22:37.182
or did you actually locate
our front door this time?

22:37.255 --> 22:39.553
-Mom.
-I came in the front door, Mrs. James.

22:39.624 --> 22:41.216
Attaboy. You hungry?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.818
Actually, could we just talk
to you and Dad?

22:44.062 --> 22:45.962
-Are you pregnant?
-What?

22:46.031 --> 22:48.591
Pregnant, with child, bun in the oven.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.396
-Mom!
-Lydia, stop.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.835
-You know that Haley's a virgin.
-Marion.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.498
And it's a damn shame if you ask me.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.267
Can we just talk to you and Dad?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.071
AII right, I can take a hint.

23:04.516 --> 23:07.542
Besides, your mother's going to tell me
every word of it.

23:07.619 --> 23:09.644
Call me with the details, Lydia.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.090
Is Dad here?

23:17.729 --> 23:20.789
Jimmy! Kitchen. Haley's pregnant.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.532
-Shall we sit?
-I think we better.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.012
-Can I help you?
-I'm his son.

23:47.025 --> 23:48.185
Is he gonna die?

23:48.260 --> 23:51.423
You should talk to your mom.
I think she's in the chapel.

23:55.133 --> 23:58.193
AII right.
Just to recap on the reasons-to-stay side.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.728
We've got: Dan's an ass, you were an ass...

24:02.240 --> 24:05.732
my new teaching job,
we both get a fresh start.

24:06.411 --> 24:10.211
Your mother annihilated my heart,
and this apartment has a killer view.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.373
So what else?

24:13.018 --> 24:14.246
Nathan.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.452
Yeah, that marriage thing
must have been tough for you.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.857
No, I meant for reasons to go back.

24:25.430 --> 24:28.126
I was wrong about him. He's a good guy.

24:29.367 --> 24:33.804
Yeah, okay. Him and Haley,
it's kind of weird...

24:35.140 --> 24:37.005
but I'm glad for them.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.308
Luke, I'm really proud of you
for getting to know Nathan.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.909
If you think you should go home,
then you should.

24:47.185 --> 24:51.144
But there are things in Tree Hill
that I'm not sure I can face.

24:52.457 --> 24:53.788
Like what?

24:54.526 --> 24:57.620
Just something I'm not proud of.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.233
I'm gonna take a little walk.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.665
Keith.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.638
I'm good.

25:10.408 --> 25:12.501
I've just gotta get a little air.

25:26.491 --> 25:27.958
What happened?

25:29.327 --> 25:32.296
I found him at the beach house
on the floor.

25:33.431 --> 25:37.299
I called 911,
but they said I might have called too late.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.571
Mom, it's not your fault.

25:44.609 --> 25:48.272
Remember when you were little,
and you had to have your tonsils out?

25:48.747 --> 25:52.581
I came to this chapel that night
and sobbed...

25:54.019 --> 25:57.785
because I had the worst feeling
that something was going to go wrong.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.023
That I was going to lose you.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.826
You didn't lose me.

26:05.664 --> 26:08.724
We're here for you, Mrs. Scott.
Whatever you need.

26:09.968 --> 26:11.629
Thank you, Haley.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.096
I guess I'm not ready to let go.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.505
We were going to tell you today.

26:26.518 --> 26:30.477
-Tell me what?
-I love your son very much, Mrs. Scott.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.682
Tell me what, Nathan?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.484
We got married.

26:44.736 --> 26:46.727
I must be losing my mind.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.297
Mom, we'll talk about it later,
when Dad's well.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.036
When Dad is well?

26:52.110 --> 26:55.079
Your father is unconscious, Nathan.
Plus he may...

26:55.146 --> 26:57.637
or may not be my husband at this point,
who the hell knows?

26:57.716 --> 27:00.184
And now you're telling me
you got married?

27:00.752 --> 27:03.152
This has got to be a joke.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.184
It's not a joke, Mom.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.417
-Mrs. Scott, we--
-Shut up, Haley.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.792
You did this to your father.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.152
-You're the reason he's here.
-Mrs. Scott--

27:12.230 --> 27:15.028
I said shut up.
Shut your selfish little mouth!

27:15.100 --> 27:16.226
Mom.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.233
You walked away from him.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.204
And you helped him do it.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.335
You're both to blame.

27:44.362 --> 27:47.456
Deb, what's wrong? What happened?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.357
He's gonna die.

27:51.436 --> 27:52.494
Who?

27:53.338 --> 27:56.535
Dan. He had a heart attack.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.075
Oh, my God.

28:02.881 --> 28:06.510
He's gonna die. And it's all my fault.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.819
They got married?

28:18.430 --> 28:22.457
-That is not the Haley James that I know.
-You mean the Haley Scott.

28:24.202 --> 28:28.764
I don't know whether to laugh
or cry or throw up.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.871
Dan's in the hospital.
Nathan is apparently married.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.177
And Keith....

28:35.814 --> 28:37.577
Have you called him?

28:38.983 --> 28:40.109
Yeah.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.044
Talk about your bad timing.

28:45.623 --> 28:50.026
It would be better if he were here.
Keith is good in a crisis.

28:53.264 --> 28:56.165
How is it possible
that they could even get married?

28:57.135 --> 28:58.466
Well.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.994
Haley James in my house between
the hours of 8:00 a.m. and midnight.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.669
-Hi, Mr. James.
-Hello, Nathan.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.811
-Did you come in through the window?
-He found the front door.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.470
Nice work, Nate.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.876
To what do we owe this surprise?

29:13.952 --> 29:16.113
We wanted to talk to you, Daddy.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.420
Daddy? This is gonna be expensive.

29:22.794 --> 29:26.389
You guys know that I am
an extremely cautious person...

29:26.664 --> 29:29.224
and I consider things from every angle...

29:29.300 --> 29:31.632
and I don't just jump into things.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.331
Like getting to the point
of this conversation?

29:34.405 --> 29:36.134
Mr. and Mrs. James.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.206
As you know,
I'm emancipated from my parents.

29:40.812 --> 29:44.179
And I think you also know
that I respect both of you very much.

29:44.249 --> 29:47.480
I think I know where this is going.
And here's the thing, Nathan.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.110
You see, if we adopt you...

29:49.187 --> 29:52.714
the making out with Haley
is gonna have to stop. At least in public.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.352
Could you guys be serious
for, like, one minute of my life, please?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.991
I'd like to marry your daughter.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.444
I didn't see that coming.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.578
Dad, Mom.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.483
I will discuss this with your father.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.482
You will?

30:24.889 --> 30:26.948
If this is what you want.

30:31.029 --> 30:32.189
It is.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.024
Brooke, wait up.

30:35.099 --> 30:37.329
-You should have told me about the letter.
-I know!

30:37.402 --> 30:40.064
Then why didn't you?
Why would you hide it from me?

30:40.138 --> 30:42.231
Because we were having fun again.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.773
Brooke, having our friendship back
has been really great.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.078
I figured Lucas is gone, so it didn't matter
what was in the letter...

30:52.150 --> 30:54.015
because it was just gonna
come between us.

30:54.085 --> 30:55.814
Why would you think that?

30:57.755 --> 31:00.315
Remember when we used to get up
every Tuesday morning...

31:00.391 --> 31:03.451
-and ride our bikes to the mall?
-So you could buy some stupid CD.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.793
Yeah, and you could buy makeup
your mom wouldn't let you wear.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.561
We'd spend half the day in my bedroom
listening to music...

31:09.634 --> 31:13.092
and putting on awful eye shadow
and that was just the Tuesdays.

31:14.606 --> 31:18.303
We used to do a lot of really great stuff
until guys got in the way.

31:20.311 --> 31:23.474
I was actually just going to the mall
with you to check out a boy.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.083
-Brooke, we were nine.
-What's your point?

31:28.519 --> 31:31.647
Okay, I am sorry.
I should have shown you the letter...

31:31.956 --> 31:34.481
but considering our history, it scared me.

31:36.261 --> 31:39.389
I just wanted my friend back
for a little while.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.696
Come on. God!

32:01.319 --> 32:02.911
Closed during the day?

32:04.822 --> 32:07.484
I guess my heart just wasn't in it today.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.558
Come on in, Mrs. Scott.

32:14.832 --> 32:15.924
I'm sorry.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.401
I really wish you could have been there,
but it was so sudden.

32:19.637 --> 32:20.729
Yeah.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.136
Is Deb here?
I figured you must have talked to her.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.371
She had to go back to the hospital.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.612
She was really upset.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.012
Dan's not doing so well.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.782
I know. But I meant with me.

32:38.656 --> 32:41.955
-Does that surprise you?
-Yeah, a little.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.516
I could understand if it was Dan...

32:43.594 --> 32:46.586
but Deb's been really supportive
of my relationship with Nathan.

32:46.664 --> 32:49.724
-Yeah, when you were dating.
-Is that how you feel?

32:50.134 --> 32:53.763
-Haley, it doesn't matter how I feel.
-It matters to me.

32:56.441 --> 32:59.933
Haley, I know that you and Nathan
are in love...

33:00.011 --> 33:03.947
and you know that I was also in love
in high school.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.213
But, sometimes, love fades...

33:09.854 --> 33:13.984
and I just hope with all my heart
that it doesn't fade for you.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.197
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Hey, man.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.428
-It's Lucas.
-Hey, man.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.666
<i>Crazy 48 hours, huh?</i>

33:26.938 --> 33:28.929
Yeah, I guess so.

33:30.308 --> 33:31.502
So, listen...

33:32.877 --> 33:35.107
I know this is weird for us...

33:36.848 --> 33:39.316
-but I just wanted to call because--
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:39.384 --> 33:41.944
He's still unconscious...

33:42.620 --> 33:46.147
but you know him. He's just waiting
to wake up on his own terms.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.950
I'm here for you, okay?
For you and Haley both.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.155
Just call if you need anything.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.234
Thanks, Luke.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.706
So, listen. How did this marriage thing
happen anyway?

34:03.841 --> 34:07.777
The boy's emancipated, Jimmy.
Haley just needs our permission.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.870
Need I remind you
that up until an hour ago...

34:09.947 --> 34:12.438
this boy came and went
through a second story window...

34:12.516 --> 34:14.485
like a horny cat burglar?

34:15.018 --> 34:18.648
-How can you even be considering this?
-Jimmy. You know our daughter.

34:18.723 --> 34:23.217
She has never done an impetuous,
hasty thing in her life.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.023
Most days,
she's more mature than we are.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.626
-They're in love.
-They're in high school.

34:30.701 --> 34:34.603
Besides, if it's meant to be,
it'll still be meant to be after college.

34:34.705 --> 34:37.902
Okay. We forbid her to do it. She hates us.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.275
She keeps seeing him.
Maybe she gets pregnant.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.676
She drops out of school.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.681
-She turns to a life of prostitution.
-Stop it.

34:46.350 --> 34:50.013
There she is,
smoking crack and sleeping in the gutter.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.085
Did you know...

34:55.293 --> 34:57.818
that my parents forbade me to marry you?

34:59.030 --> 35:02.227
-Why?
-Because they thought we were too young.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.660
-Why didn't you listen?
-Because I loved you.

35:06.337 --> 35:10.774
In the end we got married all the same.
We've made quite a life together.

35:12.577 --> 35:15.978
But I always loved them less
for not seeing what I saw in you.

35:25.356 --> 35:28.484
I've been thinking
I'm done with boyfriends for a while.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.558
Right. Brooke Davis. Solo?

35:33.397 --> 35:35.695
Relationships are just too hard.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.733
Hooking up with boys is so much easier.

35:44.175 --> 35:47.042
I've been thinking
I don't want to read the letter.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.144
I mean, you can. I just....

35:50.748 --> 35:53.239
Whatever it says, I don't want to know.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.352
Are you sure?

35:56.821 --> 35:59.221
It's not gonna change how I feel.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.424
About Lucas.

36:01.626 --> 36:05.084
Yeah, about him, or you, or me.

36:06.397 --> 36:10.026
Aren't you tired of measuring yourself
by what guys think?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.233
I just...

36:12.737 --> 36:15.706
I need to stop chasing boys
and focus on myself more.

36:20.878 --> 36:22.209
I hear you.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.043
Hos over bros.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.956
I hope it wasn't money.

37:11.529 --> 37:14.293
<i>This hasn't been going on, okay?</i>
<i>It just happened.</i>

37:14.365 --> 37:16.196
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

37:16.267 --> 37:18.258
Those are the last words
you'll ever speak to me.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.169
You are no longer my brother.
You understand that?

37:21.505 --> 37:23.370
You do not exist to me.

37:25.509 --> 37:26.703
Keith.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.971
I thought I might find you here.

37:34.585 --> 37:37.645
Yeah, I was just standing here...

37:38.422 --> 37:40.583
listening to that voice in my head.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.016
And what's it saying?

37:43.561 --> 37:46.086
It's saying if we leave this place today...

37:46.397 --> 37:48.024
we may never come back.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.168
And what does the voice
in your heart say?

37:52.903 --> 37:54.894
Luke, you know that's not fair.

37:55.573 --> 37:58.201
You know Dan's a bad guy.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.942
You said it yourself.
You hoped that he would die.

38:02.013 --> 38:05.449
I said that for you.
I know how bad you want this.

38:05.516 --> 38:09.008
-Yeah, I do want this. Don't you?
-Yeah, I do. But it's--

38:09.086 --> 38:10.314
But what?

38:10.855 --> 38:12.948
Why should we have to give it up?

38:13.991 --> 38:15.856
He was never a father to you.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.894
He leaves your mom when she's pregnant.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.420
He rides Nathan until he cracks
under the strain. Whitey, Deb.

38:21.499 --> 38:25.026
Every single life that he touches
is worse because of it.

38:25.870 --> 38:29.431
Now we're just supposed
to give it all up in his hour of need.

38:32.743 --> 38:36.509
I'm sorry, Luke,
but just give me one single reason...

38:38.015 --> 38:39.710
why I should go back.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.750
Because he's your brother.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.277
Excuse me.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.881
Could you tell me what room
Dan Scott is in?

39:20.991 --> 39:24.552
I'm sorry. He's in intensive care.
Only immediate family allowed.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.823
He's the father of my son.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.270
The tumor is pressing on your brain
and affecting your vision.

39:35.339 --> 39:38.433
So in the morning, we want to go in
and remove it.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.603
But there are risks involved.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.283
Haley, what's wrong?

39:51.889 --> 39:55.916
I was just alphabetizing our CDs,
and we don't have any doubles.

39:56.193 --> 39:57.421
Not one.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.225
So what?

40:01.499 --> 40:03.899
So, Natalie Merchant after Nas...

40:03.968 --> 40:06.095
and Wilco before the Wu Tang Clan?

40:07.004 --> 40:09.905
So you listen to crummy music.
I can live with that.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.972
We made a mistake, Nathan.

40:13.811 --> 40:15.073
-Haley.
-No.

40:15.946 --> 40:17.573
I'm not ready for this.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.084
I just really want to go home to my room.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.444
I'm not a wife. I'm not even a senior!

40:24.522 --> 40:27.252
-Haley, listen. This is not a mistake.
-How can you be sure?

40:27.324 --> 40:29.815
Because there's nobody
that thinks this thing can work.

40:29.894 --> 40:30.952
I do.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.623
I promise you, Haley.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.999
I will always be there for you.
I will always protect you.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.464
I will always protect you.

40:46.544 --> 40:47.772
AIways.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.545
Someday, this beach might wash away.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.913
The oceans may dry. The sun could dim.

41:00.758 --> 41:03.249
But on that day, I'll still be loving you.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.251
AIways and forever.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.361
I promise you, Haley.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.934
And now, Haley, please repeat after me.

41:13.938 --> 41:15.929
I, Haley, take you, Nathan.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.937
I, Haley, take you, Nathan.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.939
To have and to hold from this day forward.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.817
<i>To have and to hold from this day forward.</i>

41:38.295 --> 41:40.263
<i>ln sickness and in health.</i>

41:44.368 --> 41:46.302
<i>For richer or poorer.</i>

41:52.643 --> 41:54.941
<i>For better or worse.</i>

41:58.849 --> 42:02.478
<i>I promise that I will love and cherish you.</i>

42:08.459 --> 42:12.020
<i>And will deny all those</i>
<i>that would come between us.</i>

42:22.406 --> 42:24.670
<i>I make this promise for eternity.</i>

42:30.581 --> 42:33.141
<i>A promise that I will keep forever.</i>

42:40.591 --> 42:42.456
<i>Until the end of time.</i>

42:50.301 --> 42:52.292
<i>Till death do us part.</i>
