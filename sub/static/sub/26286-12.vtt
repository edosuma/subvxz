WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:05.506
-Previously on This Is Us...
-Nicholas Pearson?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.241
Our dad told us you died
in Vietnam.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.743
He should never have come
for me.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.846
Bec, I didn't tell you the truth
about where I went today.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.584
I went to see someone, someone
that I'd known from the war.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.552
He'd been having a rough go
of things lately,

00:18.586 --> 00:21.655
mostly because of something bad
that happened there,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.991
something he did.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.693
You know, there are people

00:25.726 --> 00:27.428
-that you can talk to.
-I'm gonna go clean up.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.999
REBECCA:
Why didn't I ask him more?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.534
I want the truth.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.503
KEVIN:
That's no way to live, huh?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.571
All messed up, living alone
for 40-some-odd years.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.407
I can't leave him like Dad did.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.087
Okay.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.596
Come on.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.732
You're spending the night
at the hotel with us.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.940
All right.
Here we go, pretty, uh,

01:12.973 --> 01:15.143
standard hotel room, right?

01:15.176 --> 01:19.280
Bathroom and bed, obviously.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.748
It looks like they got
a nice TV for you

01:20.781 --> 01:23.451
in case you want
to watch some... shows.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.886
You sure you don't want us
to order you anything to eat?

01:25.919 --> 01:29.690
NICKY:
Uh, no.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.060
You want some water, or...?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.762
KEVIN:
There's, uh, there's snacks

01:34.795 --> 01:36.564
over there, too, you know.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.132
Like, there's some Pringles
over there, if you want

01:38.166 --> 01:41.735
some Pringles.
Everybody loves... Pringles.

01:41.769 --> 01:46.006
Yeah. Uh, look... I-I'm fine.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.643
I-I just think I'm gonna,
you know, get some sleep.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.313
-So...
-Oh.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.682
-NICKY: Okay.
-Well, we'll see you
in the morning.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.250
-All right, okay.
-RANDALL: Yeah.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.452
Good night, Nicky.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.621
Good night.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.023
-Your, uh, room key.
-Okay.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.159
And, you know, I'm-I'm right
across the hall, 204,

02:05.193 --> 02:07.695
If you need anything, just knock
on the door, I'll be...

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
Good night.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.203
-Okay, so what are we gonna do?
-Shh.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.174
(whispering):
What are we gonna do?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.609
I don't know, bro.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.777
He's getting hammered
in his leaky trailer

02:23.811 --> 02:25.546
with a gun sitting next to him
on the table.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.548
And... I just offered him
Pringles.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.183
-Pringles are pretty great.
-Come on.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.551
-Don't be funny right now.
-I'm not.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.819
-I really like Pringles.
-Randall.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.790
We got to do something.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.359
We could probably throw him
some cash

02:38.392 --> 02:39.893
to make the place
a little more livable,

02:39.927 --> 02:41.529
but I don't suspect
he'll take it.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.963
Livable.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.632
He's got a hole in his ceiling.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.567
The man's got PTSD;
he's depressed.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.536
He's obviously an alcoholic.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.571
Yeah, but Kev, he's been living
like this for years.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.473
He's our uncle.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.575
He's family,
we're gonna help him.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.079
Who wants to call Mom and tell
her what's going on here?

02:59.112 --> 03:01.482
Um, um... um.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.717
(chuckles) Okay.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.853
All right. Yeah, no, I'll do it.
So you guys are a lot of help.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.689
I'll jus-- I'll-I'll take care
of the whole thing.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.224
Good night.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.426
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.899
* I made my home...

03:18.932 --> 03:21.702
KATE:
Have you been up all night?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.771
KEVIN:
Uh, yeah, I guess I have.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.840
Just doing research on, uh,
VA hospitals, vet centers.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.577
I found this place nearby in
Youngsville, looks pretty good.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.745
You know, I figure
if we can get him over there,

03:31.779 --> 03:33.614
maybe get him into an in-patient
program, if he agrees.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.916
-Mornin'.
-Morning.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.452
You know, Randall, I think
for the first time in history

03:38.486 --> 03:40.754
Kev has done more homework
than you.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.891
Did you call Mom?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.559
Yeah, I did.
I talked to her last night.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.127
How was she?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.563
It's unclear, you know.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.231
I told her where we were
and what was going on.

03:51.265 --> 03:54.468
She had some questions,
a lot of... a lot of processing.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.070
Well, I mean,
she probably feels like...

03:57.104 --> 03:58.472
Nicky.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.907
-NICKY: Hi.
-KEVIN: Morning.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.209
-KATE: Good morning.
-Morning. Morning.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.377
Sleep okay?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.078
-Slept.
-KEVIN: Good.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.580
That's good.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.616
You, uh...

04:08.649 --> 04:12.152
You ever been to this, uh,
this vet center in Youngsville?

04:12.185 --> 04:13.754
-You ever hear of that place?
-Youngsville.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.888
Yeah.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.757
Uh, no, not that one.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.727
I thought maybe we could
go there today.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.496
Yeah, well, you know, I've been
to a lot of vet centers.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.164
They're all pretty much
the same.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.434
Kev's done a lot of research.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.602
This one looks pretty cool.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.137
We don't have to go there
and spend the whole day.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.672
We can just swing by
and see what you think.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.006
REBECCA:
Hello.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.746
RANDALL:
Mom.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.013
What are you doing here?

04:41.815 --> 04:44.485
I'm Rebecca.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.720
I was Jack's wife.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.842
Uh, Kevin told me
you guys were here

05:08.876 --> 05:10.711
and I d-didn't even think
about it,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.613
and before I knew it,
I was just in the car driving.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.881
(quietly):
You...

05:16.016 --> 05:18.552
Wow.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
You have his eyes.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.690
I mean, it's-it's different,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.725
but there's something
in the eyes.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.601
Well, nice to meet you,
Rebecca.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.672
Did you know about us?

05:38.706 --> 05:40.641
NICKY:
Yeah.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.377
Uh, yeah,
I saw Jack once in, um...

05:43.411 --> 05:46.246
He came up here in early '92.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.048
Um...

05:48.081 --> 05:49.983
And he showed me your picture.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.719
Showed all of you.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.521
And, uh,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.424
you know, he-he seemed,
he seemed very, uh...

05:56.457 --> 05:58.559
He seemed very happy.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.763
I'm just gonna go outside
for a moment.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.301
JACK:
Can't tell you how good
it is to be home.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.915
(Rebecca sighs)

06:25.719 --> 06:27.120
You can't sleep?

06:27.154 --> 06:30.458
Neh.

06:30.491 --> 06:34.795
I'll see your "neh" and raise
you a... (blows raspberry)

06:38.298 --> 06:40.067
-Jack.
-Supposed to take Kevin

06:40.100 --> 06:42.235
to the mall tomorrow

06:42.269 --> 06:45.272
and get some baseball cards
signed,

06:45.305 --> 06:48.308
but I... just...

06:48.341 --> 06:50.811
(sighs) I need a day.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.846
I'll take him.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.383
-You sure?
-Yeah.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.818
Thanks, babe.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.853
Of course.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.628
KATE:
Dad, you're back. Yay!

07:07.661 --> 07:08.962
Yeah.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.465
Good to be home, Katie girl.

07:11.499 --> 07:14.434
Did you get me something?

07:14.468 --> 07:17.771
Did I...?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.607
You know what?
It was such a short trip

07:19.640 --> 07:21.441
that I forgot your snow globe,

07:21.475 --> 07:22.910
but I'll bring you two
next time, okay?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.578
KEVIN:
Dad, let's go.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.446
-We got to get there early.
-RANDALL: I don't even know

07:26.480 --> 07:27.981
why you want John Smiley's
autograph.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.417
Everybody's saying he's getting
traded to the Twins.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.620
That's why I got to get my card
signed now, Dorkburger.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.188
He might not be in Pittsburgh
much longer.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.757
If I don't get my card signed,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.425
it's never gonna double
in value.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
Dad, get dressed. Come on.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.362
Oh, actually,
I'm-I'm gonna take you, Kev.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.666
-Why?
-'Cause I want to.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.534
And I think it'll be fun.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.701
Go get your jacket.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.170
I'll meet you in the car, okay?

07:50.203 --> 07:52.372
Go. Go ahead.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.841
-You're gonna have fun
with your mom, okay?
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.475
KATE:
Mom, you're supposed to help us

07:55.509 --> 07:57.044
with our Valentine's Day cards.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.112
I've seen you with
a magic marker, Bug.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.614
You don't need my help.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.651
And Dad will be here
if you need anything, okay?

08:09.723 --> 08:10.891
KEVIN:
Mom.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.727
You all right?

08:20.267 --> 08:23.236
I remember that weekend, I do.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.206
He, um...

08:26.239 --> 08:30.310
said he was going
to visit some war buddy,

08:30.343 --> 08:32.713
somebody he had had
a falling out with.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.582
And it was right around
Valentine's Day.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.686
He was acting so strangely.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.222
Huh.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.558
I think the-the best thing
for us to do now

08:44.592 --> 08:48.061
is just to get him into that,
that vet center, you know?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.863
If we get him over there,
he can't,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.699
can't argue going, right?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.101
And then maybe we can
convince him to stay.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.536
What?

08:56.570 --> 09:00.540
Kev, I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow in L.A.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.009
-Right.
-I'm not supposed to miss

09:02.042 --> 09:03.611
-any appointments.
-Of course. No.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.545
Just... I get it.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.414
I got to go, too, bro.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.282
What? What do you mean?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.719
It was supposed to be
a sibling road trip.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.687
Wh-- Randall, you drove.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.189
I know.
But my wife is unemployed

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
and she's all over the place.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.127
You know, I-I take office
in the next few weeks,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.695
and God only knows
what kind of effect

09:21.729 --> 09:23.263
that's gonna have
on my family.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.565
Look, I... I can't,

09:25.599 --> 09:27.768
I can't just camp out
in some hotel

09:27.801 --> 09:29.903
with an uncle
who doesn't want our help

09:29.937 --> 09:32.740
and Dad didn't want us to know
in the first place.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.408
-Wow.
-What?

09:35.442 --> 09:36.977
Wh-- You jump at the chance
to save everybody else

09:37.010 --> 09:39.546
on the planet, our uncle
needs help, he's family,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.014
and-and you-you got to be home
in time for dinner.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.720
(sighs)

09:46.754 --> 09:48.555
I'm sorry. I'm tired.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.790
I-I was up all night.
I didn't sleep.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.725
-I-I'm sorry.
-KATE: Mm.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.427
It's all right.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.599
(sighs)
Looks like it's you and me.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.639
Mother-son day.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.809
It's gonna be fun.
(laughs)

10:23.390 --> 10:25.458
Just because he kept something
from us

10:25.492 --> 10:27.627
doesn't mean
you didn't know him.

10:27.661 --> 10:31.264
He had stuff going on,
and we had absolutely no idea.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.969
Like, no, he saw Nicky
in 1992, he said.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.971
-Yeah.
-And we had no clue.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.675
Yeah, because we were 11.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.443
You know what's weird?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.545
Hmm?

10:45.578 --> 10:48.215
I think I remember that weekend.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.051
That... he went away
on a work trip...

10:51.084 --> 10:53.453
-Mm-hmm.
-...and when he came back,

10:53.486 --> 10:55.956
that's the day
that we had the sequin fight.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.493
-Oh, the sequin fight.
-Yeah.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.629
God, we destroyed the house.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.065
Oh, my gosh,
I remember Dad...

11:05.098 --> 11:08.668
just laughing,
completely covered in sequins.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.872
We were finding little sequins
in the floor cracks for years.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.674
Hmm.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.544
What?

11:17.577 --> 11:20.213
Nothing.

11:20.247 --> 11:24.051
* Sorry I had to go

11:24.084 --> 11:25.318
* Sorry...

11:25.352 --> 11:28.688
I miss that house.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.725
(Randall sighs)

11:31.759 --> 11:34.161
You know, when William and I
took that trip

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
to Memphis before he died,

11:36.129 --> 11:38.231
we went to visit
his childhood home,

11:38.265 --> 11:40.667
and the owners let us in.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.203
It was pretty cool for him,
I think.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.273
Yeah.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.708
Got a couple hours
to kill before your flight.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.778
Not that far from Pittsburgh.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.748
Okay. The thing I...

11:54.782 --> 11:57.350
I think you're forgetting is,
our childhood home is gone.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.387
Right, the house isn't there,
but the yard is,

12:00.420 --> 12:04.557
the street is, the...
the-the neighbors.

12:04.591 --> 12:08.028
* Free falling
into parts unknown... *

12:08.061 --> 12:10.097
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.100
Dad, I'm gonna write a personal
note to everyone in my class

12:13.133 --> 12:14.534
and then cover it in sequins.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.103
(indistinct male voice on TV)

12:16.136 --> 12:17.370
Dad?

12:17.404 --> 12:21.108
It's good, Katie girl.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.110
What about you, Randall?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.412
-The Simpsons say it better
than I ever could.
-Mm.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.248
Dad, can you help me count
footballs?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.550
MAN (on TV):
...an eye on that.
Their score 29.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.720
Uh, you know what?
Why don't, um...?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.589
Why don't you guys do it
yourselves, okay? I have, uh...

12:36.623 --> 12:38.926
-I got some stuff to do.
-KATE: Like what?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.795
You know, grown-up stuff.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.797
Work, taxes.

12:43.831 --> 12:46.233
Just don't go making a mess,
okay?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.235
Your mother's gonna lose it
if she comes home

12:48.268 --> 12:51.538
and the house is a disaster,
okay? Okay.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.143
(birds singing)

12:59.612 --> 13:01.614
Hey, Dad.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.285
What's up, bud?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.134
(overlapping chatter)

13:21.168 --> 13:23.170
This is our lounge.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.673
We have sessions for vets,

13:26.706 --> 13:28.876
service members
and their families.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.011
Hey, and, uh,
all the counselors are...

13:31.044 --> 13:33.380
-They're vets themselves,
correct?
-Exactly.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.782
So you're talking to someone who
knows what you're going through.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.551
We also have financial
caseworkers to help you

13:38.585 --> 13:41.354
sort out your benefits,
any disability payments.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.224
And of course, we have
one-on-one counseling, as well.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.995
I can introduce you

13:48.028 --> 13:50.197
to a few more folks,
or I can answer

13:50.230 --> 13:52.232
-any questions.
-No, thank you.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.235
VET CENTER REP:
I'll let you talk.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.470
Just let me know if there is
anything else I can do for you.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.107
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.712
Pretty nice place, huh?

14:05.745 --> 14:08.315
Look...

14:08.348 --> 14:10.517
I appreciate the effort, I do.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.487
I can tell that me
seeing this place, you know,

14:14.521 --> 14:17.257
meant something to you, so,
you know, here I am.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.494
But I've been
to counselors before,

14:21.528 --> 14:24.231
and it didn't work.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.934
Also, I'm a drunk.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.403
Oh, and also, I can't seem
to leave my trailer

14:30.437 --> 14:32.405
without getting the shakes.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.107
You think, uh... you think

14:34.141 --> 14:36.009
doing a jigsaw puzzle's
gonna fix that?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.711
I think a meeting could help.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.380
-It won't.
-It could.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.714
It won't!

14:41.748 --> 14:43.883
(Nicky scoffs)

14:43.917 --> 14:45.285
(sighs heavily)

14:45.318 --> 14:47.387
You're out of your depth, kid.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.459
Well... Mm.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.630
Mom, I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna take a minute.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.413
Hey, Kev.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.383
I'm sorry, Mom.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.586
I'm just frustrated, you know.
Uh, it's been a long, uh...

15:19.619 --> 15:22.255
(sighs heavily)

15:22.289 --> 15:24.757
(clears throat)

15:24.791 --> 15:26.893
I make it all the way here,
you know.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.629
I-I... I actually find my uncle.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.631
(sighs)

15:31.664 --> 15:34.401
To have it end this helplessly
just-- it sucks.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.636
Yeah, I know.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.605
And you know what?
I'm mad at Dad.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.608
I'm pissed off
that he never told us about him.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.343
He's been gone 20 years.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.944
He had a brother
this whole time.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.114
I-I had an uncle
I could have known.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.851
I'm sorry.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.354
No. No. I'm mad, too.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.024
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.527
And it's hard to be mad at
someone who's not here anymore.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.497
There's nothing you can...
do with those feelings.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.699
But, yeah.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.069
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm mad.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.322
-(crowd chatter)
-(sighs)

16:31.391 --> 16:34.627
Hey, Kev, I'm really hungry.
Why don't we go get some lunch?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.297
Then we'll come back and see
if the line's any shorter, yeah?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.699
They said they're shutting down
at 2:00. I'm not leaving.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.502
Hey, Kevin, I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.171
We're gonna go get some lunch,

16:44.204 --> 16:45.872
and then we will come back,
okay?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.374
-No!
-Come on.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.677
-Yes. Come on.
-No!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.312
I need his rookie card signed.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.181
-I'm not leaving.
-(sighs)

16:54.214 --> 16:56.316
Okay, fine.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.252
I will go get us some lunch,
and you stay in line.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.388
-You promise me
you'll stay in line?
-Fine.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.756
Okay, I'll be right back.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.897
I know you probably want
to get back home.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.533
Do you mind if we spend
one more night here?

17:13.566 --> 17:16.769
Sure. Fine.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.738
Okay.

17:21.774 --> 17:25.212
I think it's time
you and I talked.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.751
Wild Draw Four.
Sorry, Grandpa.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.587
-Ruthless.
-Don't worry, Ma.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.290
We're only staying here
a few weeks, a month, at most.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.292
-I'm sorry.
-What are you talking about?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.594
-We love having you here.
-Dad doesn't love

17:41.628 --> 17:44.231
that his painting studio
is now Ella's bedroom.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.798
Oh, I love it.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.101
I love that you didn't listen
to your father

17:48.135 --> 17:50.270
and ran off and eloped
with a musician

17:50.303 --> 17:53.906
and have now returned home at 28
to take over my painting studio.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.109
-Fine. Then we'll leave.
-(doorbell rings)

17:56.143 --> 17:57.444
I'll get it.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.347
No, I'll get it.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.453
Hi. I'm Randall.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
Um, this is my sister Kate.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.922
-Hi.
-It's a super weird story,

18:09.956 --> 18:11.924
but we actually
used to live in this house.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.727
-Well, not this house, but...
-I'm sorry. It's a bad time.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.664
It's...

18:17.697 --> 18:20.800
You should have let me talk.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.436
I panicked.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.638
Actually, I almost said,
"Hi. I'm Randall Pearson,

18:25.672 --> 18:27.607
and I'm running
for city council."

18:27.640 --> 18:29.342
-It's a force of habit.
-(chuckles softly)

18:29.376 --> 18:31.578
(Randall sucks air
through teeth)

18:31.611 --> 18:34.013
Wow.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.582
Almost all the houses

18:35.615 --> 18:38.385
on the street look
completely different.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.522
I was thinking

18:42.555 --> 18:46.326
about the day
we had the sequin fight.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.196
I think that was the day
that we invented Pearson Pizza.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.599
That was that day?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.667
Yeah.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.136
-I mean, it might have been.
-Huh.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.706
(knocking on car window)

18:59.739 --> 19:01.208
Oh.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.809
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.644
Do you want to see my room?

19:11.050 --> 19:13.320
(rhythmic panting)

19:13.353 --> 19:14.821
-You okay?
-(grunts softly)

19:14.854 --> 19:16.889
Yeah.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.459
I'm okay, bud.
I'm fine.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.229
We're hungry.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.298
You are?
Well, just order a pizza.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.634
Whatever you guys want, okay?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.069
Something for your mom
and Kevin, too.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.672
Okay? Get the money out
of my wallet.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.709
You want us to order a pizza?

19:36.743 --> 19:40.547
Yeah. Yeah, something everybody
will like, okay?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.582
Okay.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.520
(panting, hissing)

19:47.554 --> 19:49.556
(birds singing)

19:53.560 --> 19:55.562
(sighs)

20:18.951 --> 20:20.920
(line ringing)

20:20.953 --> 20:23.456
Hi. You're reached Zoe.
Leave a message.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.725
-(beeps)
-Hey. Uh, Zoe, it's me.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.761
Ugh. I think
I'm gonna be home tomorrow.

20:28.795 --> 20:33.700
My uncle's a mess,
his trailer's a mess.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.402
Took him to the vet center,

20:35.435 --> 20:38.471
he barely even looked at it,
so, um...

20:44.644 --> 20:46.813
(whispers):
I don't know.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.848
Talk to you later.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.753
My grandma told me
I could come and get you.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.121
Hello!

20:55.154 --> 20:56.723
-Hi! (chuckles)
-Hi!

20:56.756 --> 20:58.325
-I'm Kate.
-Geeta.
-Rohan.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.659
I'm Randall. Hi.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.594
-Geeta.
-Randall.
Nice to meet you, Geeta.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.163
Sorry about my daughter
slamming the door in your face.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.566
She's-she's going through
a tough time right now,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.768
-which has become
our tough time.
-It's okay.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.737
-But welcome.
-Come.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.105
-(sighs) Thank you.
-Wow.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.408
It's really different.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.578
I don't even know what room
I'm standing in right now.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.314
How long ago did you live here?

21:21.348 --> 21:24.684
We lived here
in the '80s and '90s.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.486
The house got rebuilt
after we left.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.888
Why did you move?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.524
We grew up.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.761
ELLA: Was this fireplace here
when you lived here?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.195
RANDALL:
Uh, no.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.664
Actually,
it was completely different.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.166
This used to be the dining room.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.934
And over there,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.937
that was the living room.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.340
What is it, Kate?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.709
Um...

21:49.742 --> 21:51.711
This is where it happened,
Randall.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.180
This is-- this is where
we had the sequin fight.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.483
Right here.
(chuckles)

21:56.516 --> 21:58.651
Dad said we could order
our own pizza?

21:58.685 --> 21:59.952
Yes!

21:59.986 --> 22:02.154
Ho-ly crap!

22:02.188 --> 22:04.657
(deep voice):
Hi, I'm an adult.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.025
Can I order a pizza?

22:06.058 --> 22:08.728
(laughing)

22:08.761 --> 22:10.363
(chuckles)

22:10.397 --> 22:14.567
I'm sure being here
brings back a lot.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.236
Yeah.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.672
Yeah. We were just...

22:19.706 --> 22:21.173
telling stories
about when we lived here

22:21.207 --> 22:22.409
and we had a sequin fight.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.977
This place was covered,

22:25.011 --> 22:26.679
absolutely covered in sequins.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.716
I mean, we had
some awesome days here.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.018
But that day was the awesomest.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.021
No.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.558
I don't think it was, Kate.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.527
Don't you remember?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.862
You remember the plate?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.832
Don't you remember
that broken dish?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.234
-* I can't live
without your love *
-(door opens)

22:48.267 --> 22:50.670
-(door closes)
-KATE: Dad, we invented
the greatest pizza

22:50.703 --> 22:52.204
in the history of the world!

22:52.238 --> 22:54.407
One favorite pizza topping

22:54.441 --> 22:57.076
-for everyone so that...
-Hey, what-what is this?

22:57.109 --> 22:59.278
What is this?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.548
Kate, I asked you. I asked.

23:01.581 --> 23:05.051
I specifically asked you
for one thing today:

23:05.084 --> 23:06.185
do not make a mess!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.720
So y-you're gonna clean this up.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.556
Okay?

23:09.589 --> 23:10.557
I didn't need this today, Kate.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.691
I didn't need it.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.259
* I wait

23:13.292 --> 23:15.628
* Mm, here for an answer

23:15.662 --> 23:18.465
* Wonder if tomorrow
will be like yesterday. *

23:18.498 --> 23:20.767
(plate shatters)

23:30.342 --> 23:32.945
Dad, what happened?

23:33.946 --> 23:35.715
Plate.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.651
Slipped out of my hand
when I was

23:38.685 --> 23:40.553
putting it in the sink.
I'm sorry.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.754
-I can give you...
-No, no, no, no, no.

23:41.788 --> 23:42.622
Stop, stop.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.623
You're gonna hurt yourself.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.559
Just...

23:46.593 --> 23:48.561
Go get me the broom.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.731
KATE:
I don't remember that at all.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.234
Dad didn't throw a plate.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.770
He let us order pizza.
We had a sequin fight.

23:57.804 --> 24:00.507
-I don't think
that's right, Kate.
-Well, I do,

24:00.540 --> 24:02.108
-'cause I remember it.
-Okay.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.176
Fine.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.444
What, Randall?

24:05.478 --> 24:07.514
GEETA:
(chuckles) Sorry,

24:07.547 --> 24:11.718
but we're probably heading out
soon, so...

24:20.827 --> 24:23.295
(indistinct chatter)

24:27.734 --> 24:31.003
So, he told me some good places.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.205
And I also did my research.
Um, but, yeah,

24:33.239 --> 24:34.841
there's this one placed
called the Pub.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.676
-JOHN: Oh. Nice.
-Yeah, it's really good.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.913
You know, when I found out
that you were alive...

24:42.081 --> 24:45.017
...I didn't want to meet you.

24:45.051 --> 24:48.187
'Cause I didn't want to...

24:48.220 --> 24:52.725
unravel what Jack
had always told me.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.997
It has been a long time
since I've been in a room

24:58.030 --> 25:01.200
with somebody who has memories
of him that I don't know.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.037
(exhales)
But...

25:09.609 --> 25:12.211
Do you have any fun stories
about your childhood?

25:14.346 --> 25:18.350
Wasn't a childhood
worth remembering.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.555
(whispers):
Yeah.

25:22.589 --> 25:25.825
Well, he never really told me
a whole lot about you.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.526
He told you I died.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.896
Because, uh,

25:29.929 --> 25:31.898
he wished I was dead.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.704
The kids told me what happened.

25:37.737 --> 25:41.574
Sounds horrific
and-and very complicated.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.910
I'm-I'm sorry.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.514
You know, for what it's worth,

25:48.547 --> 25:51.283
right before he passed away,
Jack was newly sober.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.785
And...

25:52.819 --> 25:55.021
he was opening up
in ways he never had before.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.889
And I obviously don't know
for sure,

25:56.923 --> 25:59.626
but I...

25:59.659 --> 26:02.795
I think he would've found
his way back to you.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.599
(exhales)
Well,

26:06.633 --> 26:08.601
he missed his chance.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.804
Yeah, he did.

26:11.838 --> 26:15.808
But you still have a chance
to make things right,

26:15.842 --> 26:18.077
because I'm here.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.012
And his son is here.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.051
And Kevin is...

26:25.084 --> 26:28.487
Oh, he's always been tricky.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.490
He's harder to define.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.792
It was great meeting you, Kevin.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.526
Thank you.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.999
What did you say during your
big moment with John Smiley?

26:40.032 --> 26:42.869
Nothing. I asked him to sign
my card, and he signed it.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.338
I have to pee.
Can-can you wait?

26:46.372 --> 26:47.807
Yeah. Here,
I'll hold your stuff. Go pee.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.476
-Thank you.
-It's right there. Go, go.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.748
Hi. Sorry. 'Scuse me.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.283
-Mr. Smiley? Hi.
-Yes?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.786
You just met my son.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.855
You signed his rookie card
for him?

27:02.889 --> 27:04.623
-Yeah.
-I was wondering what you guys

27:04.657 --> 27:06.525
were talking about.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.028
Uh, he wanted to tell me where I
could shoot pool in Minneapolis.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.030
-What?
-He read in the paper

27:11.063 --> 27:12.865
I'm going to get traded
to the Twins.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.367
Which... could happen.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.603
And he has my rookie card, so...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.105
See?

27:19.138 --> 27:21.708
"John enjoys hunting, karate,

27:21.741 --> 27:23.442
"shooting pool...

27:23.475 --> 27:25.111
(chuckles)
"watching drag racing,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.846
and going to the beach."

27:26.879 --> 27:29.548
Yeah, he said he took a travel
guide out of his school library.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.818
Gave me a list
of karate centers, too.

27:31.851 --> 27:35.822
I didn't even know that Kevin
knew his school had a library.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.958
He said he just... wanted
to make sure I was happy,

27:38.991 --> 27:41.227
wherever I ended up.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.529
Special little boy you have.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.364
And I run into a lot of them.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.499
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.535
-Thank you very much.
-Of course. Thank you.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.137
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you, too.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.671
Hey, I hope
you don't get traded.

27:52.705 --> 27:55.041
-Yeah. Me, too.
-(chuckles)

27:57.009 --> 27:59.812
REBECCA:
I know he seems

27:59.846 --> 28:01.814
like he has it all.

28:01.848 --> 28:05.684
He's tall and he's handsome and
he seems so confident, but...

28:05.718 --> 28:07.319
really, underneath all of that,

28:07.353 --> 28:09.688
he's just
a sensitive little boy.

28:09.722 --> 28:12.024
And he's had
a really tough year.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.762
He is newly sober,
just like his father.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.997
And...

28:18.030 --> 28:20.833
he's just worried about you.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.601
He's worried about your health.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.603
He's worried
about your leaky roof.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.905
Because he cares.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.540
This is so important to him.

28:28.574 --> 28:31.778
You are already so important
to him.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.946
Because...

28:33.980 --> 28:36.949
because you're family to him
already.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.450
So let me get this straight.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.252
Um, the message here is, uh,

28:40.286 --> 28:42.755
"Shape up, Nicky,
'cause the kid needs a win"?

28:42.789 --> 28:44.791
No, that's not what I'm saying.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.793
I-I'm not a prop, Rebecca.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.094
I'm not...

28:48.127 --> 28:50.729
Kevin sees me as family.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.398
Well, you know how I see him?

28:52.431 --> 28:57.269
I-I see him as a tall, blond kid
who pulled me from my home,

28:57.303 --> 29:00.406
the only place I'm comfortable,

29:00.439 --> 29:02.875
so a movie star could, uh,

29:02.909 --> 29:06.846
you know,
be a real-life hero for a day.

29:33.806 --> 29:37.343
RANDALL:
I think they might call the cops
if we don't leave soon.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.079
Did I misremember
our entire childhood?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.313
No.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.349
Of course not.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.452
That was the day that, uh, Dad
had seen his estranged brother,

29:46.485 --> 29:48.287
who he lied to us about.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.090
You remember him yelling at me
and throwing a plate,

29:51.123 --> 29:54.093
and I remember a sequin fight.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.562
How can it be the same day?

29:58.564 --> 30:00.666
Means he did a good job.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.601
You remember the good stuff.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.136
Or I'm completely delusional.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.938
No.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.340
Look, we all have bad days
as parents.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.342
I've had some doozies.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.643
And you will, too.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.946
You've had some doozies?

30:13.980 --> 30:16.682
It's hard to believe,
but... yeah.

30:18.684 --> 30:21.153
Look, all you can do as a parent

30:21.187 --> 30:23.856
is try to pack the days with
as much good stuff as possible

30:23.890 --> 30:26.692
and hope
that it outweighs the bad.

30:26.725 --> 30:30.696
You hope
that the good stuff sticks.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.199
That's what he did for us.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.011
It's looking good, guys.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.821
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.589
Okay? Dad's tired.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.191
Forgive me?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.565
Great.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.367
Hey, by the way,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.003
this pizza is so good.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.571
You guys might be geniuses.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.041
-Pizza geniuses.
-Pizza geniuses.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.376
I mean, this is so good,
we got to name it. Right?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.511
What should we call it,
Pearson Pizza?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.181
I mean, Randall,
I'm-I'm really coming around

31:22.214 --> 31:24.183
to this whole spinach thing,
you know?

31:24.216 --> 31:25.417
Adds a nice crunch.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.419
Makes me feel like Popeye.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.421
(imitates Popeye's laugh)

31:29.455 --> 31:31.357
No?

31:31.390 --> 31:34.760
(chuckles)
Katie girl, I think, um...

31:34.793 --> 31:37.429
I think this one could use
a couple more sequins.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.398
Don't you?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.467
Dad!

31:41.500 --> 31:42.969
(laughing):
Oh, my God. Oops.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.204
I-I missed.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.373
-(laughing)
-I don't... Wow.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.075
What's wrong with my hand?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.542
Something's wrong...

31:50.576 --> 31:52.278
with my hand.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.348
-Sequin fight?
-Sequin fight.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.485
-Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
-(Kate yells)

31:59.518 --> 32:01.287
JACK:
Who got some... Whoa!

32:04.991 --> 32:07.126
You okay?

32:07.159 --> 32:09.495
Yeah.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.645
I'm sorry that we
invaded your space.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.147
It was never...

32:28.180 --> 32:29.481
-Stop.
-our inten...

32:36.055 --> 32:39.758
Uh, Jack liked
to build things as a kid.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.761
I was, uh,
I was real bad at it.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.863
But, um...

32:44.896 --> 32:47.499
he was a frickin' artist.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.336
He could...
he could build anything.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.805
He once built a-a tree fort
in our backyard.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.375
See, Nicky?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.944
"Tongue and groove, Nicky."

32:58.977 --> 33:00.612
Like that.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.581
Tongue and groove.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.218
NICKY:
"Tongue and groove."

33:06.252 --> 33:08.687
That's what he'd say.
(chuckles)

33:08.720 --> 33:11.057
I didn't know what the hell
he was talking about.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.830
I wanted to be a writer.

33:21.767 --> 33:25.003
And then I, uh,
I wanted to be a doctor.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.374
And then...

33:28.407 --> 33:30.376
I didn't...

33:30.409 --> 33:33.645
want anything.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.620
I used to be a person.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.192
I...

33:46.225 --> 33:48.760
wish I could...

33:48.794 --> 33:52.664
be that person again...

33:52.698 --> 33:56.135
but it's been so long,
I-I don't think I can.

34:02.308 --> 34:03.509
(sniffles)

34:03.542 --> 34:06.345
Anyway, um...

34:06.378 --> 34:08.114
you drove a long way,

34:08.147 --> 34:12.050
so the least
I could do was, um...

34:12.084 --> 34:13.585
tell you about...
(sighs)

34:13.619 --> 34:16.488
...Jack's tongue-and-groove
fort.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.261
And, uh...

34:25.397 --> 34:27.766
(sighs)

34:27.799 --> 34:31.470
(crying): You guys were
all he ever wanted.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.680
(knocking at door)

34:48.487 --> 34:50.489
Come on. Let's go.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.134
NICKY: Final step--
plasterboard goes up there.

35:02.168 --> 35:04.170
Never had anyone tall enough.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.110
(quietly):
All right...

35:14.380 --> 35:16.315
You're not bad at this.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.116
You done it before?

35:18.150 --> 35:21.453
No. I did play a handyman
in a student film one time

35:21.487 --> 35:22.988
a while back.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.456
It's not porn.
Honest to God.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.058
I know it sounds
like porn, but...

35:30.629 --> 35:32.164
Well, that ought to do it.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.300
-That ought to do it.
-Yep.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.946
You don't need to worry
about my...

35:47.979 --> 35:50.249
leaky roof anymore.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.319
I wasn't worried.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.621
Okay.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.888
Um...

35:59.225 --> 36:02.894
And I'm going to...
go to one of those meetings

36:02.928 --> 36:05.297
at the, um, vet center.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.299
I don't promise
I'm gonna go to two meetings,

36:07.333 --> 36:10.035
but I'll, you know,
I'll go to one.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.403
Really?

36:11.437 --> 36:12.771
Yeah.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.643
I know you want to fix things.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.645
Fix me.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.514
And I w...

36:22.548 --> 36:25.584
I wish I could give you that.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.486
But...

36:27.519 --> 36:29.855
you...

36:29.888 --> 36:32.123
and, uh, your family...

36:33.425 --> 36:36.094
It's just...

36:36.127 --> 36:38.196
too painful.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.034
So, um...

37:00.151 --> 37:02.220
Uh...

37:05.090 --> 37:07.192
It was a pleasure to meet you.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.060
And, uh...

37:09.094 --> 37:11.062
maybe I'll see you again.

37:11.096 --> 37:13.131
-Maybe.
-Okay.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.570
(door opens)

37:20.171 --> 37:22.974
RANDALL:
Hello? Hello, hello?

37:23.008 --> 37:24.142
-Family?
-Hey.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.811
What's going on, girls?

37:25.844 --> 37:28.914
Good to see you.
I missed you.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.149
Eatin' your dinner and all.
Mwah!

37:31.182 --> 37:33.285
-How you doing, sweetie?
-ANNIE: Good. How are you?

37:33.319 --> 37:34.786
Mm, good, thank you.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.988
Whoa. Taking a trip?

37:37.022 --> 37:38.757
My mom hurt her damn hip again.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.592
You know, I just got off
the phone with the hospital,

37:40.626 --> 37:43.094
and I was gonna call you, but
then I had to get on the phone

37:43.128 --> 37:45.130
and make a plan with Zoe, then
the hospital called again...

37:45.163 --> 37:46.665
-Is she okay?
-No...

37:46.698 --> 37:49.100
Yeah. I just hope
she didn't break it again.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.670
Um, I got to head down to D.C.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.339
-Of course. When?
-Now.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.774
I was just waiting on you
to get back.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.343
I got to pick up Zoe
from the train station.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.777
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.245
-I love you.
-All right. Love you.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.113
-Yeah.
-I'll call you from the road.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.849
All right, girls, love you.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.984
-Bye-bye.
-Love you.
-Bye.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.356
Oh, boy.
(clears throat)

38:10.389 --> 38:14.125
Angelica, Eliza, Peggy.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.461
-I'm Peggy?
-You're Peggy.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.629
Why is this bag so heavy?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.365
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Presents.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.799
Yay!

38:20.832 --> 38:23.301
Can I get a drumroll, please?

38:23.335 --> 38:26.104
You don't get any presents
without a drumroll.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.607
-God, you're so embarrassing.
-"You're so embarrassing."

38:28.640 --> 38:30.642
Good.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.178
(singsongy):
Where are my guys?

38:33.211 --> 38:35.381
(gasps)

38:35.414 --> 38:38.984
-There's one.
-Oh, hi. We missed you.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.052
-Hi.
-Oh-ho-ho.
You must be so exhausted.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.288
(softly):
I got you some new slips.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.190
-Thank you.
-So just slap these
on your feet.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.859
-I'm gonna make you
some tea, okay? Mwah.
-Okay.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.528
-Wait, babe.
-Yeah?

38:51.029 --> 38:53.965
When we buy a house,
I want a backyard.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.067
And I want to get
a projector screen.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.737
And I want
to take our son out there,

38:58.770 --> 39:01.973
and I want to bring
blankets and popcorn,

39:02.007 --> 39:04.743
and I want to stay up late,
and I want to...

39:04.776 --> 39:07.479
I want to show him
all of our favorite movies.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.915
* Maybe it's a sign
of weakness *

39:09.948 --> 39:11.216
Okay.

39:11.249 --> 39:14.052
* But I don't know what to say

39:14.085 --> 39:15.320
* Maybe I

39:15.353 --> 39:17.155
* Wouldn't know

39:17.188 --> 39:20.859
* What to do
with strength anyway... *

39:20.892 --> 39:22.093
For Deja.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.062
Fancy non-smelly lotions

39:24.095 --> 39:25.897
-in the sample size.
You're welcome.
-Hmm.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.766
And for you two,

39:27.799 --> 39:30.869
gossip magazines featuring
the world's hottest celebrities

39:30.902 --> 39:32.671
pumping their own gas

39:32.704 --> 39:34.740
and scooping
their own dog's poop.

39:34.773 --> 39:35.774
-Celebrities.
-Ooh.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.075
* We belong to the lie

39:37.108 --> 39:39.778
* We belong to the thunder

39:41.580 --> 39:44.115
* We belong to the sound

39:44.149 --> 39:45.050
* Of the words...

39:45.083 --> 39:46.752
(laughing):
Hi.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.421
Hey, babe. Sorry. Um...

39:49.455 --> 39:52.958
a sequin fight broke out,
and we couldn't help it.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.561
It-it just happened.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.062
Sorry.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.898
(laughs):
I am not cleaning this up.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.099
Understood.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.333
-REBECCA: 'Kay.
-Okay.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.070
Go ahead. Join...

40:05.103 --> 40:07.072
JACK: Get him! Get the new guy!
Get the new guy!

40:07.105 --> 40:08.974
JACK:
Hey! Oh, he's getting a heart!

40:09.007 --> 40:10.642
-(lively chatter)
-He's getting a heart one!

40:10.676 --> 40:12.911
-Dad!
-He's getting a heart one!

40:23.922 --> 40:26.124
You did exactly
what you set out to do.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.260
You should feel
really good about that.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.996
Yeah.

40:32.798 --> 40:35.100
I mean, I'm
really grateful to you.

40:35.133 --> 40:38.436
'Cause if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be able to...

40:38.470 --> 40:41.306
(chuckles softly)
...think about your father

40:41.339 --> 40:45.010
building a fort, saying,
"Tongue and groove, Nicky."

40:46.311 --> 40:49.280
So thank you for that.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.983
KEVIN:
My uncle's a mess.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.952
His trailer's a mess, it's...

40:53.985 --> 40:56.354
I took him to the vet center,
he barely even looked at it.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.456
So I'm...

41:02.661 --> 41:05.030
(whispers):
I don't know.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.065
talk to you later.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.011
(grunts)

41:49.007 --> 41:52.210
(coughing)

41:53.078 --> 41:54.846
(exhales)

41:54.880 --> 41:56.347
(sniffles)

42:02.087 --> 42:04.923
I'm really proud of you, Kevin.
