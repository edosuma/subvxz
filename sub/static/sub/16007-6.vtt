to get close to Felix

to see if she could get him
to reveal who kneecapped him.

07:49.241 --> 07:52.277
Yesterday, she and Andy played out
the violent boyfriend scenario,

07:52.853 --> 07:56.885
which was designed to convince Felix
that the only way to protect her

07:56.901 --> 07:58.889
was to contact that man.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.853
Who turned out to be Brett Bonar?
Yep.

08:00.873 --> 08:02.877
Why did he play the boyfriend
when there was a risk

08:02.897 --> 08:04.893
whoever shot Felix
might be someone he'd met?

08:07.997 --> 08:08.901

Do we think Brett
shot up the Nobakhts' house?

08:11.889 --> 08:14.125
That doesn't make sense.
He was a mate.

08:14.150 --> 08:16.849
And weapons are passed around
all the time.

08:16.869 --> 08:17.933
Brett probably onsold that gun
months ago.

08:18.853 --> 08:20.913
Considering he used it
to put a hole the size of a dim sim

08:20.933 --> 08:24.051
in Felix's patella first,
I think we can safely assume

08:24.071 --> 08:26.075
he was involved in criminal activity
of some kind.

08:26.091 --> 08:27.889
Although what and who for,

08:27.909 --> 08:31.027
unfortunately he's no longer
in a position to tell us.

08:32.917 --> 08:35.913
This undercover thing's
been going on for a while?

08:37.852 --> 08:38.849

he, um...

12:33.885 --> 12:36.865
..recognised my colleague
and fired on us both.

12:38.901 --> 12:41.901

12:54.929 --> 12:56.929
The surest way to be safe, though,

12:56.954 --> 12:59.905
is for us to find out

14:23.849 --> 14:26.085
when some idiot
overturns a conviction,

14:26.110 --> 14:28.463

So, I'll now be appearing
before the SCC in the morning

14:38.933 --> 14:41.110
and, given they took
both your phones,

14:41.135 --> 14:43.155
it's a fair bet
that you'll be called as witnesses.

14:43.849 --> 14:45.857
Do you know what it's about?
No, but whatever it is,

14:45.877 --> 14:47.913
they'll want to catch me in a lie,
make me look unethical.

14:47.933 --> 14:50.913
And if they can do that with the
help of my own staff, even better.

14:50.933 --> 14:54.875
So, is there anything on your phones
the SCC might throw in my face?

14:54.900 --> 14:58.253

that aren't quite appropriate?

14:58.913 --> 15:00.909
Oh, like that sext you sent me.

15:00.929 --> 15:03.849
Have I ever sent you anything
off-colour?

15:05.845 --> 15:09.140

or emailed anyone about me,

15:09.165 --> 15:10.877
about my work?

15:10.897 --> 15:13.074

Oh, I don't know.

15:13.861 --> 15:15.901
Let's start with
the last couple of weeks, I suppose.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.901
Well, I...

15:17.921 --> 15:20.937
I texted Andy about your...
your manner.

15:23.921 --> 15:25.885
What about it?

15:25.905 --> 15:29.865
Well, it's hard to remember
the exact words.

15:29.881 --> 15:31.893
Try a precis.

15:33.877 --> 15:37.857
I think it had to do with
you knowing it all

15:37.877 --> 15:40.054
and making the rest of us
feel stupid.

15:42.913 --> 15:44.889
Any others?

15:47.885 --> 15:51.933
I might have suggested that
sometimes you can be a little bit...

15:52.853 --> 15:56.921
..unyielding
and maybe something about, um...

15:56.941 --> 15:59.913
..you being condescending
and patronising.

16:01.853 --> 16:02.909
Thank you, Lina.

16:11.933 --> 16:14.849
Me?

16:14.865 --> 16:16.897
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

16:22.929 --> 16:30.845
Ah, Heather did send me a text once,
um, comparing you to an ice queen,

16:30.865 --> 16:35.861
all phenomenal cosmic powers
and a heart of ice,

16:35.881 --> 16:38.352
But I set her straight -
I replied and said

16:38.377 --> 16:40.401
that you're not an ice queen,
you're just a control freak.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.853
But in a good way.
In... in a good way.

16:48.873 --> 16:50.913
There was that text you sent me

16:50.933 --> 16:53.110
after I told you
I found that bracelet

16:53.135 --> 16:54.881
that Todd bought for Elaheh.

16:54.901 --> 16:57.849
Remember when I said
we'd have to spend $1,750

16:57.869 --> 16:58.937
and you said,
"Don't tell the taxpayer."

16:59.857 --> 17:01.913
You don't think...
Yeah, no.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.521
Can't be that. It's too trivial.
If I was the Attorney-General

17:05.547 --> 17:08.559
with evidence that a political enemy
had misappropriated public funds...

17:08.845 --> 17:10.140
The Nobakhts are here.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.454
Bahman's up first.
Start with the money?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.148
Or go back to the shooting?
Money.

17:15.861 --> 17:16.936
Great.

17:17.853 --> 17:18.905
You alright?

17:19.936 --> 17:22.901
Yes. Let's get going.

17:39.857 --> 17:42.210
Ms King,
can we get on with this, please?

17:42.235 --> 17:45.239
Sam and I have already
missed our flight

17:45.857 --> 17:47.885
and we've got to get home
so we can rebook for tomorrow.

17:47.905 --> 17:49.913
I'm afraid you won't be
going anywhere, Mr Nobakht.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.345
What?
You were trying to leave the country

17:52.370 --> 17:55.253
with more than twice
the permitted amount of cash.

17:55.278 --> 17:57.366
Our credit cards don't work in Iran.
We have to take cash.

17:57.853 --> 17:59.881
$30,000 American?

18:07.845 --> 18:09.929
I need it to stay out of the Army,

18:10.849 --> 18:14.929
to avoid
compulsory military service.

18:15.849 --> 18:19.865
We are still Iranian citizens,
so I have to.

18:19.885 --> 18:23.853
Although, you can buy
an exemption certificate.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.281
That's how Amil got off.

18:25.853 --> 18:29.877
That's how all Iranian guys
who live overseas get off.

18:29.893 --> 18:33.861
But now with the war with ISIS,

18:33.877 --> 18:37.881
Iran needs soldiers more than money,

18:37.901 --> 18:41.877
so we cannot buy certificate
after this week.

18:41.897 --> 18:44.897
If I don't go back to Tehran
by Friday,

18:44.913 --> 18:47.933
I will be sent to the Iraqi border.

18:54.869 --> 18:57.917
Just don't go back at all.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.526
I mean, they can't extradite you
for missing military service.

19:01.551 --> 19:04.845
You're an Australian resident.
My mother.

19:04.865 --> 19:10.877
Her exit visa was rejected so she
can only visit once or twice a year.

19:10.897 --> 19:16.849
And we can go back, but it's very
difficult to all live in Australia.

19:17.921 --> 19:21.873
If I don't get exemption in time,

19:21.893 --> 19:24.917
they will find a reason
to arrest her.

19:24.933 --> 19:27.849
So please, Ms King, can we just go?

19:27.869 --> 19:30.869
We haven't finished
with Sam's evidence, Mr Nobakht.

19:30.894 --> 19:32.898
Please sit down.

19:34.921 --> 19:36.873
Sit down.

19:44.933 --> 19:48.893
Where did you get US $30,000?

19:48.913 --> 19:52.901
We've accessed
your family bank statements.

19:52.921 --> 19:56.569
There's no record of you having
anything like this kind of cash

19:56.594 --> 19:58.542
available before.

20:05.925 --> 20:10.869
Amil and Todd
have a friend from school.

20:10.889 --> 20:13.419
I think you have spoken to him.
Brett Bonar?

20:13.861 --> 20:16.877
Brett knew we needed the money
for Sam,

20:16.893 --> 20:18.913
so he come to Amil

20:18.933 --> 20:21.869
and he said
he could pay us $40,000...

20:22.917 --> 20:25.925
..if we could put our business name
and address

20:26.845 --> 20:29.728
on the bill of lading
for some overseas container.

20:29.753 --> 20:30.865
OK.

20:30.885 --> 20:33.180
What was in the container?
I don't know.

20:33.205 --> 20:34.382
Weren't you curious?

20:34.857 --> 20:36.845
I didn't particularly like
the arrangement.

20:36.865 --> 20:38.917
Was Brett setting this up
for himself or someone else?

20:38.937 --> 20:42.467
I don't know anything more about it.
I just needed the money.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.869
I told you what you wanted to know!
May we please go?

20:45.889 --> 20:46.941
You're not going anywhere,
Mr Nobakht,

20:47.861 --> 20:49.920
until you're straight with us.
I am!

20:49.945 --> 20:53.357
Night of the 31st, someone
shot 14 bullets into your house.

20:55.849 --> 20:56.913
Who?
I don't know.

20:56.933 --> 20:59.913
Not cooperating with the
royal commission - that's contempt.

20:59.933 --> 21:02.933
Committing perjury is worse
and now you face charges

21:02.953 --> 21:05.542
of taking undeclared cash
out of the country.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.547
So I'll ask you once again.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.198
Who shot up your house?

21:14.865 --> 21:15.941
It was Brett, OK?

21:16.857 --> 21:17.897
Why?

21:17.917 --> 21:20.853
I changed my mind
about the container,

21:20.869 --> 21:21.937
wanted nothing to do with it.

21:22.252 --> 21:23.889
But when I told Brett,

21:23.909 --> 21:27.145
he said we still had to be
the point of contact, had to.

21:27.861 --> 21:29.917
You understand?
He shot up your house to warn you?

21:29.933 --> 21:31.901
It was very upsetting.

21:31.921 --> 21:35.569
Brett was the first friend Amil made
when we come to Australia,

21:35.594 --> 21:36.630
and for him to do this...

21:36.857 --> 21:38.901
Why didn't you want to be involved
with the container anymore?

21:38.921 --> 21:41.274
Todd was murdered!
Whatever was going on,

21:41.849 --> 21:43.497
I wanted no more part of it!

21:43.522 --> 21:45.534
But you still took the money.
We were desperate!

21:45.845 --> 21:47.885
By then, it was our only choice.

21:47.905 --> 21:51.553
Did Todd tell someone about
the arrangement with the container?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.853
Is that why Brett killed him?

21:53.869 --> 21:55.885
Brett didn't kill Todd.

21:55.901 --> 21:57.893
How can you be sure?

21:57.913 --> 22:00.941
Brett loved Todd.
He was shocked when he die.

22:01.861 --> 22:05.873
Devastated! We were all devastated!
Do you know who shot him?

22:05.889 --> 22:07.913
No. He was a good young man.

22:07.933 --> 22:11.885
A bit foolish sometimes,
but a good husband to my daughter.

22:11.905 --> 22:15.023
And he would have been a good father
to my grandchild.

22:15.845 --> 22:18.897
Do you really think I wouldn't
tell you who killed him if I knew?

22:18.917 --> 22:22.212
Alright. Thank you, Mr Nobakht.
We'll take a short break.

22:22.237 --> 22:25.173
Then I'll call Amil for evidence.
Thank you.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.089
Well, you've had one hell
of a morning.

22:36.114 --> 22:38.122
Hey, you OK?
Always.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.853
Look what just turned up
at Brett's place.

22:42.857 --> 22:45.865
Whoa! Who needs that many guns?

22:45.885 --> 22:48.121
Someone who shoots people
for a living.

22:49.917 --> 22:54.881
And also, I found this
in Brett Bonar's fish tank.

22:54.897 --> 22:56.893
It's a 9mm Zodiac PT92.

22:56.913 --> 22:59.893
Ballistics just confirmed it put
one round into Felix Murphy's leg

22:59.913 --> 23:02.325
and 14 into Bahman's house.

Oh, that's great news.

23:03.921 --> 23:05.937
Lina Badir? Thank you.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.941
Brett's DNA results are in.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.214
Brett's DNA matches
one of the two traces

23:12.239 --> 23:13.275
found at George Healy's murder.

23:13.845 --> 23:14.901
And he did the drive-by
and shot Felix.

23:14.921 --> 23:16.865
Got around, didn't he?
Has Bahman said

23:16.885 --> 23:20.003
who Brett was arranging the
container importation for?

23:20.019 --> 23:22.003
Doesn't know, or says he doesn't.

23:22.023 --> 23:26.869
Andy, did Brett's DNA match traces
found at any other crime scene?

23:27.937 --> 23:30.901
It didn't match the DNA
at Ash's murder.

23:30.917 --> 23:34.881
Brett didn't kill her.

23:34.897 --> 23:36.885
But he knew who did.

23:36.901 --> 23:38.881
Must have, he worked with him.

23:38.901 --> 23:41.137
He murdered George alongside him
and...

23:42.853 --> 23:46.869
..and now we can't ask Brett
who that man is.

23:46.885 --> 23:47.929
Thanks.

24:25.933 --> 24:28.913
FELIX: Who is it?
Me.

24:38.913 --> 24:41.853
Get them to say their name.

24:41.869 --> 24:43.917
"Me"? Could be anyone.

24:43.933 --> 24:45.897
Yeah, could.

24:49.937 --> 24:52.913
I've briefed
the witness security team.

24:54.857 --> 24:58.916
You should have a new identity and
a ticket to the UK within 24 hours.

24:58.941 --> 25:00.849
The UK?

25:00.869 --> 25:03.909
Well, given the level of threat,
overseas was deemed safest.

25:03.929 --> 25:05.917
What about my car? My stuff?
You can't.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.879
Mum. I gotta...
You can't go home.

25:07.904 --> 25:09.952
That part of your life's over.

25:11.857 --> 25:13.861
Dead and buried.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.901
Felix, you're safe here.
We weren't followed

25:15.921 --> 25:18.845
and I've organised
a police guard for overnight.

25:18.861 --> 25:21.849
You really are a cop, aren't you?

25:24.861 --> 25:28.869
That doesn't mean I don't know
how scary this must be.

25:33.893 --> 25:36.897
Or that I didn't enjoy
getting to know you.

25:38.861 --> 25:41.901
I felt good with you...
or with Steph.

25:41.921 --> 25:44.845
Felt like a better person
for a minute.

25:44.861 --> 25:45.897
You are a good person, Felix.

25:45.917 --> 25:48.565
You tried to help a woman
in fear of her life.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.598
Seems you can look after yourself.

25:52.901 --> 25:55.857
Giving us Brett
was a really important piece

25:55.877 --> 25:58.873
of this gun crime puzzle the royal
commission's trying to solve.

25:58.889 --> 26:00.857
But he didn't shoot you for free.

26:00.873 --> 26:02.932
Whoever you owed money to paid him.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.988
And that person, he's up to his
eyeballs in the drive-bys,

26:05.004 --> 26:06.917
the kneecappings, the murders.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.877
Who lent you the money?

26:09.921 --> 26:11.925
Oh, so that's how this works?

26:11.941 --> 26:14.845
I don't tell you what you want

26:14.865 --> 26:16.933
and my shiny new identity and
ticket to Neverland just goes away?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.893
No...
And I get shoved out the door

26:18.913 --> 26:20.893
to be shot
and dumped in the Parramatta River!

26:20.913 --> 26:23.853
You gave us Brett. Tomorrow,
we're getting you out of here.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.861
But if we don't take down
whoever he worked for,

26:25.877 --> 26:26.913
tomorrow there'll be another Brett

26:26.933 --> 26:28.913
in Western Sydney,
shooting people for money.

26:28.933 --> 26:30.921
I can't tell you.
They'll find out.

26:30.941 --> 26:33.881
No, they won't. You're safe here.
Well, how do you know?

26:33.901 --> 26:35.877
They could have got in
and bugged the place.

26:35.897 --> 26:38.074
This place is secure, Felix.
Trust me.

26:38.099 --> 26:39.885
Trust you?

26:39.901 --> 26:41.865
I already did.

26:56.849 --> 27:00.877
The phone number on the bill of
lading for the container was yours.

27:01.929 --> 27:04.877
Yes, I put my number on the form.

27:04.897 --> 27:07.074
When I was told
the container arrived,

27:07.099 --> 27:09.115
I let Brett know, but that's it.

27:10.885 --> 27:13.937
Who did Brett report to?
No idea.

27:14.857 --> 27:17.897
Get the call it was there,
let Brett know.

27:17.917 --> 27:20.035
It was
a straightforward arrangement.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.938
Which included
falsifying Port Authority documents

27:22.963 --> 27:25.761
and knowingly
making bogus claims to Customs.

27:25.913 --> 27:27.873
For which you were paid.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.869
Thank you, you're excused.

27:38.941 --> 27:41.865

27:43.933 --> 27:45.889
If you give me your wife's address,

27:45.909 --> 27:48.873
I can make sure that
we involve the relevant authorities.

27:48.893 --> 27:51.070
Australian police
have no power there!

ISIS is 100km
from the Iran-Iraq border.

27:53.901 --> 27:55.849
Sam is not a soldier.

27:55.865 --> 27:57.889
This royal commission of yours

27:57.909 --> 28:00.913
is set up to protect us
from gun violence.

28:00.933 --> 28:05.881
And you're going to send
my youngest boy, a film student,

28:05.897 --> 28:07.869
to face the bullets of ISIS?

28:07.885 --> 28:08.921
Are you?

to lose someone that you love.

We've already lost Todd.

28:21.877 --> 28:23.885
Please.

28:29.893 --> 28:31.909
OWEN: Do we believe
that the Nobakhts had no idea

28:31.929 --> 28:33.929
that the container
was full of guns

28:33.949 --> 28:36.361
or who Brett was working for
or with or...

28:36.386 --> 28:37.845
I believe them.

28:37.865 --> 28:39.885
I think they considered him
to be part of the family.

28:39.905 --> 28:42.023
And now they've lost him too.
Well...

28:42.039 --> 28:43.216
Live by the sword...

28:43.241 --> 28:45.865
Hi.
Bianca.

28:45.885 --> 28:49.238
Ever noticed how undercover work
on TV seems so glamorous?

28:49.263 --> 28:51.905
I saw Felix.
He's not gonna tell us anything.

28:51.925 --> 28:54.873
Right. The expression
'square one' springs to mind.

28:54.893 --> 28:56.865
Did you explain
how critical that name is?

28:56.885 --> 28:59.857
He's terrified they'll blame him
for Brett's death.

28:59.877 --> 29:00.937
Short odds.
I've got him into WitSec.

29:01.857 --> 29:05.681
They're moving him OS. But for him,
the only safe path is silence.

29:05.706 --> 29:07.726
I'll speak to him.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.873
You won't change his mind.
I'm the one who's lost a partner.

29:10.893 --> 29:13.917
He won't see just another cop. He'll
see a victim of crime, just like him.

29:13.937 --> 29:16.349
Just another cop?
That's not what I meant.

29:16.849 --> 29:17.897
Why didn't you speak to him
yourself?

29:17.917 --> 29:19.925
Instead of creating a situation
where someone got killed!

29:20.845 --> 29:21.917
We need that name.
He's traumatised, Janet.

29:21.937 --> 29:24.905
We've stirred up serious shit
for him. It's not fair do this.

29:24.921 --> 29:27.039
If Felix doesn't tell what he knows,

29:27.059 --> 29:30.589
another innocent person's
gonna end up with a bullet in them.

29:30.614 --> 29:32.440
That's not fair.

29:35.917 --> 29:38.937
Briefing room now.

29:39.941 --> 29:43.118
Lina, the woman Keisha
heard scream when Todd was shot?

29:43.853 --> 29:44.929
I'm going through
the police interviews,

29:45.849 --> 29:47.877
contacting every female
in the area - there are hundreds.

29:47.897 --> 29:50.849
Alright, what about Brett?
I've been going through his phones.

29:50.869 --> 29:53.921
He had three. He had numbers for all
the powerful men in Western Sydney,

29:53.937 --> 29:57.885
including Patrick Boccaro, Sam Hall,

29:57.901 --> 29:59.897
Luigi Alfarno, Ahmed Mohammed,

29:59.917 --> 30:03.905
Mustafa Ibrahim, Bao Long -
practically every POI on the board,

30:03.921 --> 30:05.905
including Simon Hamilton.

30:05.925 --> 30:09.925
Brett Bonar called Simon Hamilton
three weeks before Todd was killed.

30:09.945 --> 30:11.913
This major's looking dodgier
by the minute.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.853
OK, unless we get any more
out of Brett's phone,

30:14.869 --> 30:17.885
the Nobakhts are unlikely.

30:17.905 --> 30:21.889
And until Felix Murphy reveals
at whose behest he was kneecapped,

30:21.909 --> 30:24.498
best line of inquiry
for Todd Wilson's murder

30:24.747 --> 30:27.865
and the container of guns
is now Major Simon Hamilton.

30:27.885 --> 30:29.917
There are connections.
Todd stole Simon's identity.

30:29.933 --> 30:31.897
We can't prove Simon knew that.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.857
Todd was shot with a 3D-printed gun

30:33.877 --> 30:35.877
Simon had a file
for one of these on his computer.

30:35.897 --> 30:37.909
But we searched his house.
No printer, no filaments.

30:37.929 --> 30:40.518
No evidence he'd ever
actually made a weapon.

30:40.857 --> 30:41.917
Could have made it at work,
taken it home.

30:41.937 --> 30:45.845
And Simon's never said where he was
the night that Todd was murdered.

30:45.865 --> 30:48.160
Should we recall him?
No, he stonewalls.

30:48.185 --> 30:50.249
Let's wait until we've got a plan
and we can break him down.

30:50.857 --> 30:52.889
How far back have you gone
into Simon's phone?

30:52.905 --> 30:54.877
Two weeks before Todd's murder.

30:54.897 --> 30:57.545
Maybe we should go further.
Two months, three.

30:57.857 --> 31:00.328
You can find all sorts of things
on phones.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.925
It's the best sav blanc
the house can provide.

31:18.941 --> 31:20.921
Cheers.

31:24.901 --> 31:27.865
Are you not drinking? Shit day?

31:28.869 --> 31:31.281
What do you think?
You were almost killed.

31:31.877 --> 31:34.113
No, the worst thing
that happened to me

31:34.138 --> 31:36.550
was a mountain
of post-shooting paperwork.

31:37.845 --> 31:39.963
I hear this place
does great falafel.

31:39.988 --> 31:41.694
How was it, being undercover?

31:43.917 --> 31:47.861
It wasn't really. I just came in
to play out a scenario with Bianca.

31:48.873 --> 31:50.885
I saw the surveillance footage.

31:50.901 --> 31:52.845
From the reserve.

31:55.897 --> 31:57.845
Yeah.

31:57.861 --> 32:00.865
That's pretty intense, watching...

32:00.881 --> 32:02.865
..watching what you did to her.

32:02.881 --> 32:04.849
It had to convince Felix.

32:04.869 --> 32:06.937
It looked like when you grabbed her
you were doing it for real.

32:07.857 --> 32:09.853
We'd talked about it.
Bianca knew what was coming.

32:09.873 --> 32:11.933
That you'd toss her to the ground
and put a gun to her head?

32:12.853 --> 32:16.265
She said I had to go that far.
It was all with her consent.

32:20.881 --> 32:22.877
And I'm sorry you had to see it.

32:23.933 --> 32:26.889
I'm sorry you had to do it.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.925
Um...

32:40.941 --> 32:43.853
..I've got some news.

32:45.885 --> 32:48.933
Um... I'm pregnant.

32:49.849 --> 32:52.873
(WHISPERS) You're joking?

32:52.889 --> 32:54.242
(LAUGHING) No, I'm not.

32:54.267 --> 32:58.195
Oh, my God, are you serious?

33:31.937 --> 33:33.889
Come in.

33:50.917 --> 33:53.329
Is it true Brett
was killed by the police?

33:53.921 --> 33:56.853
Something to do
with the royal commission?

33:56.869 --> 33:57.909
Yeah.

33:58.929 --> 34:01.988
So like him to want to help find out
who killed Todd.

34:06.845 --> 34:07.905
Why...

34:07.925 --> 34:10.864
Why did you let him be there?
He was helping you.

34:10.885 --> 34:13.869
You should have protected him.
You shouldn't have let him get shot!

34:13.885 --> 34:14.933
Keisha.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.889
Brett wasn't working
FOR the royal commission.

34:18.905 --> 34:20.880
What do you mean?

34:22.853 --> 34:24.853
What do you mean, Richard?

34:24.869 --> 34:27.853
I mean, we were focusing on him.

34:27.869 --> 34:28.909
What, he... he was a suspect?

34:28.929 --> 34:30.897
Royal commissions
don't use that terminology.

34:30.913 --> 34:32.849
We prefer 'person of interest'.

34:32.869 --> 34:35.864
Yes, Brett's activities brought
him under our terms of reference...

34:35.885 --> 34:38.415
What activities?
I can't reveal the details.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.558
He was into some pretty nasty stuff.

34:40.857 --> 34:42.900
I'm sure he wasn't a saint, but...

34:42.920 --> 34:45.157
..he was always
completely sweet to me.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.853
He was involved in gun crime.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.873
You're not telling me
he killed his best friend?

34:58.889 --> 35:00.937
No, other crimes.

35:01.941 --> 35:04.881
Brett wouldn't hurt anyone.

35:04.897 --> 35:06.662
I don't... I don't believe it.

35:06.853 --> 35:07.901
Well, that's up to you.

35:07.921 --> 35:09.865
You're not telling me
what he's done!

35:09.885 --> 35:11.901
God forbid you do anything
that might upset your boss!

35:11.921 --> 35:14.897
It's nothing to do with Janet.
You always do what she tells you!

35:14.913 --> 35:16.897
Yeah, she's usually right!

35:16.913 --> 35:18.849
Sorry.

35:20.889 --> 35:22.897
Why are you here?

35:23.929 --> 35:26.881
Why are you here?
What do you want?

35:26.897 --> 35:28.877
To see you.

What did you make?

A blue snake.
Oh!

Well, I can't wait
to meet Mr Blue Snake.

Are you coming up Saturday?
Yeah, I'm hoping to.

36:49.893 --> 36:51.913
Things are just a little bit hectic
at the moment.

36:51.929 --> 36:53.881
OK, keep me informed.

36:53.897 --> 36:55.917
Did you find your iPad?

36:55.937 --> 36:58.877

you know.

36:58.897 --> 37:02.309
No, not yet. But I promise
I'll FaceTime them tomorrow, OK?

Alright. I'd better get them fed.

37:45.881 --> 37:47.929
Did you speak to Felix?

37:49.857 --> 37:51.897
I decided it was a bad look.

37:51.913 --> 37:53.909
For you?

37:55.881 --> 37:57.885
For the royal commission.

38:00.889 --> 38:03.881
So you're on stand-down?

38:03.897 --> 38:05.905
Automatic, after a shooting.

38:05.921 --> 38:07.861
And the obligatory counselling.

38:07.881 --> 38:10.176
You'll have to talk
about what happened.

38:10.901 --> 38:12.861
Plenty of opportunity.

38:12.881 --> 38:14.909
Between us, police complaints,
the coroner.

38:14.929 --> 38:17.106
Well, you won't have a case
to answer.

38:17.131 --> 38:18.889
I mean, you had to shoot him.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.905
Didn't you?

38:22.885 --> 38:25.885
If I didn't want him to shoot Andy
and then me, yes.

38:27.849 --> 38:29.857
God, all that work.

38:29.877 --> 38:32.348
We don't know that Brett
would have talked.

38:32.373 --> 38:34.845
But to get that close
and lose everything.

38:34.861 --> 38:36.845
You know I'm the one who...

38:36.865 --> 38:37.937
Taking a human life
is not insignificant,

38:38.857 --> 38:40.849
no matter what horrific things
that person has done.

38:40.865 --> 38:41.893
Of course...

38:41.913 --> 38:44.857
And Felix, he rebuilt his life
and now it's ruined,

38:44.877 --> 38:46.861
because I did a brilliant job
winning him over,

38:46.877 --> 38:47.901
which got us nowhere.

38:47.921 --> 38:50.392
On top of that,
the SCC has taken my phone,

38:50.417 --> 38:53.241
trawling through it
looking for God knows what...

38:53.266 --> 38:55.266
I'm sorry all this has happened.

38:55.929 --> 38:59.929
I just don't think I can talk about
your commission right now, Janet.

39:06.857 --> 39:08.975
Then perhaps we should leave things.

NEWSREADER: The 28-year-old man
shot here by police this morning

39:24.580 --> 39:26.917
has been identified
as Brett Ian Bonar.

39:26.933 --> 39:29.857
Police are refusing to confirm.

39:29.877 --> 39:32.849
Mr Bonar's death
is connected to investigations

39:32.869 --> 39:35.987
arising from the King
Royal Commission into gun crime.

39:36.012 --> 39:39.849
Meanwhile, Robert Carter
maintains his vigil

her car was struck by a vehicle

39:55.997 --> 39:59.037
in what police have called
suspicious circumstances.

39:59.853 --> 40:03.885
With violent crime showing no sign
of abating in the city's west,

40:03.905 --> 40:07.913
Commissioner Janet King has yet
to issue even an interim report.

40:07.933 --> 40:10.885
The Attorney General
has also not commented.

she really expects...

42:17.917 --> 42:20.800
Oh, I thought you'd ditched
that security blanket.

42:20.825 --> 42:23.885
I can't let her down, OK?

42:23.905 --> 42:27.082
I'm steeped in Protestant
work ethic, like, up to here.

42:27.107 --> 42:30.083
Dutiful to my core.

42:31.869 --> 42:33.853
I like your hair like that.

42:33.869 --> 42:35.929
It's more you.

42:39.873 --> 42:41.579
The people of New South Wales

42:41.861 --> 42:43.937
expect their public officials
to be of impeccable character

42:44.857 --> 42:49.869
and to display behaviour
that is beyond reproach.

42:49.889 --> 42:54.857
Now, when it comes to allegations of
corruption against public officials,

42:54.877 --> 42:58.230
they apply what is quaintly referred
to as 'the pub test'.

42:58.853 --> 43:01.971
That is, if behaviour looks,
sounds or smells corrupt,

43:01.996 --> 43:04.913
then it probably is.

43:04.933 --> 43:07.893
This State Corruption Commission
hearing

43:07.913 --> 43:10.937
is the result
of information received.

43:11.853 --> 43:15.901

43:15.921 --> 43:20.861
that you, someone who holds one
of the highest of public offices,

43:20.881 --> 43:22.885
attempted to pervert
the course of justice.

43:22.905 --> 43:25.905
Commissioner Embry, may I ask when
this alleged attempt took place,

43:25.921 --> 43:27.869
and what it actually was?

43:27.885 --> 43:30.937
No, Mr Gillies, you may not.

43:31.857 --> 43:34.740
While Ms King may wish
to listen to you, I do not.

an employee of the DPP
and now a royal commissioner,

43:48.869 --> 43:52.517
would you agree that your conduct
must be of the highest order?

43:52.857 --> 43:53.917
Yes, and mine is.

to get out of bed, Richard?

43:56.861 --> 43:57.869

would have no reason

43:59.857 --> 44:00.893
to criticise your professionalism?

in any workplace,

"Tell her about Filippetti.
She'll be fine."

45:28.941 --> 45:32.849
By Filippetti,
you were referring to...

45:33.877 --> 45:36.865
Crown versus Filippetti, 1984.

45:36.881 --> 45:38.845
And what happened in that case?

45:38.865 --> 45:41.885
The accused was not convicted
of possession

45:41.905 --> 45:45.258
because the drugs were found
in the living room of a house

45:45.274 --> 45:46.569
shared by many people,

45:46.594 --> 45:49.133
so the Crown could not...

45:51.917 --> 45:57.845
So the Crown could not prove
who actually owned the drugs.

45:57.865 --> 46:00.748
In other words,
you were giving Mr Stirling advice

46:00.773 --> 46:04.733
on what his friend needed to do
to avoid charges of drug possession.

46:07.917 --> 46:11.881
Advising on ways
to avoid criminal charges -

46:11.901 --> 46:18.857
that is perverting the course
of justice, Ms King, is it not?

46:23.861 --> 46:25.893
Janet, I'm so, so sorry.

46:25.913 --> 46:27.869
I never should have
gotten you involved.

46:27.889 --> 46:30.873
It's a bit late now. She's already
facing a full public hearing.

46:30.893 --> 46:32.869
Did you forward that text to anyone?
No.

46:32.889 --> 46:35.861
Well, did one of Keisha's flatmates
get a hold of your phone, or...

46:35.881 --> 46:37.901
I didn't even see them.
They were all out at some gig.

46:37.917 --> 46:39.909
Would it help if I explained?

46:39.929 --> 46:43.853
Fell on my sword? Self-immolated?
It's not your fault, Richard.

46:43.873 --> 46:45.885
Roger Embry's had it in for me
for years.

46:45.905 --> 46:48.909
Never forgiven me for turning down
his drunken proposition at uni.

46:48.929 --> 46:51.857
Don't forget he's a mate
of the Attorney-General. Hello?

46:51.877 --> 46:55.407
What I want to know is how the SCC
found out about that text.

46:55.432 --> 46:58.138
Not from me.
Well, somebody found out about it.

46:58.889 --> 47:01.654
Janet, listen...
Don't you have somewhere to be?

47:07.925 --> 47:09.905
Ah, how are you feeling?

47:09.925 --> 47:12.901
Strong? Weak? Icy?
Spit it out.

47:12.921 --> 47:16.216
Your sister-in-law's appealing
the probate judge's ruling

47:16.241 --> 47:17.865
on the frozen embryo.

47:17.881 --> 47:19.587
Now, it's listed for hearing,

47:19.612 --> 47:21.604
but with everything
on your plate at the moment,

47:21.849 --> 47:22.905
my advice would be
to seriously consider

47:22.921 --> 47:24.881
whether it's worth pursuing.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.877
I don't know. I don't know.

47:30.933 --> 47:35.901
Deborah.
Deb's the anonymous informant.

47:35.917 --> 47:37.857
Well, how do you figure that?

47:37.877 --> 47:39.941
You remember when I texted Richard
and she was sitting nearby.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.925
Do you think she overheard me talking
about drugs in the living room,

47:44.845 --> 47:47.493
or could she possibly have googled
Filippetti?

47:47.518 --> 47:48.921
Ahh...

47:48.941 --> 47:52.877
Aunty Deb with her platitudes
about family and love.

47:52.893 --> 47:53.917
Janet. Janet.

47:53.937 --> 47:56.349
You know, I won that probate ruling,
Tony.

47:56.853 --> 47:58.889
Jesus, Janet, you do not want
another court case now.

47:58.909 --> 48:02.853
You're already the subject
of a corruption investigation,

48:02.873 --> 48:04.865
and you're running
a royal commission.

48:04.885 --> 48:08.853
Not to mention giving Lincoln 'God's
gift to Attorney-Generalling' Priest

48:08.869 --> 48:10.693
another stick to beat you with.

48:10.718 --> 48:13.542
Let me know when you want
to talk appeal tactics.

48:13.567 --> 48:16.563
Oh...

48:18.865 --> 48:21.865
I take it Roger Embry's
off the Christmas card list?

48:21.885 --> 48:23.849
Oh, good to hear
the grapevine's healthy.

48:23.869 --> 48:24.921
Couple of journalists
phoned already,

48:24.941 --> 48:26.913
asking why you've been caught
by the SCC.

48:26.929 --> 48:28.897
I gave them my best finger.

48:28.913 --> 48:30.929
As only you can. Anything else?

48:31.696 --> 48:33.873
Andy sorted out
the infra-red cameras,

48:33.893 --> 48:35.877
but he stopped short
of buying you a new iPad.

48:35.897 --> 48:38.849
Simon Hamilton's phone?
Barren as a boulder so far.

48:38.865 --> 48:40.925
Screaming female witness? Richard?

48:41.845 --> 48:43.933
Ballistics on the guns Andy found
at Brett's are starting to come in.

48:44.853 --> 48:47.795
I'm checking those against
other firearm incidents.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.140
Keep up the good work.

49:01.937 --> 49:04.929
Did she say
"Keep up the good work"?

49:06.889 --> 49:09.881
I think I like her better
as an ice queen.

49:35.873 --> 49:38.638
Simon Hamilton's phone -
I've been going through

49:38.845 --> 49:40.257
everything he had on it.

49:40.853 --> 49:42.849
Calls, texts, emails, photos.

49:42.865 --> 49:43.901
I'm about three months back

49:43.921 --> 49:45.889
and there's nothing
you wouldn't expect.

49:45.905 --> 49:47.845
But just now the signal came up

49:47.865 --> 49:48.917
showing that an app
had been deleted.

49:48.937 --> 49:51.996
I ran it through the recon program,
reconstructed it.

49:52.021 --> 49:53.877
Turned out to be a dating app.

49:53.897 --> 49:57.897
Well, not so much dating as a "meet
and let's have sex right away" app.

49:57.917 --> 50:00.885
Soon as you open it up, up
comes photos of people in your area

50:00.905 --> 50:03.611
who're up for it.
I know what a hook-up app is.

50:03.636 --> 50:05.889
Ah. This one was a gay one.

50:05.909 --> 50:07.909
OK.
Yeah, I know.

50:07.929 --> 50:10.885
I pegged Simon Hamilton for
as straight as they come too,

50:10.905 --> 50:12.893
so I started going
through all the profiles

50:12.909 --> 50:14.845
of the blokes he'd checked out.

50:14.865 --> 50:16.921
Look, his sexual orientation's
of no relevance to us.

50:16.937 --> 50:19.873
I know it's not. It's not that.

50:19.893 --> 50:22.877
This was the last guy
Simon hooked up with.

50:22.893 --> 50:24.889
After this, he deleted the app.

50:29.869 --> 50:30.941
Robbie Carter?

50:39.925 --> 50:41.913
How's that for a coincidence?

50:41.929 --> 50:43.913
That's not a coincidence.

50:43.929 --> 50:46.917
It can't be.

51:16.917 --> 51:18.901
Who is it?
Me.

51:18.917 --> 51:21.849
Sergeant Grieve.

51:24.849 --> 51:25.913
So you say.

51:29.933 --> 51:31.937
(SIGHS PROFOUNDLY)

51:34.889 --> 51:36.937
Oh, I play myself.

51:37.853 --> 51:38.937
A form of therapy.

51:39.857 --> 51:42.853
Most people in your situation
would go for scotch.

51:44.861 --> 51:46.845
Passport and a new name.

51:46.861 --> 51:48.391
Midday flight to Heathrow.

51:48.416 --> 51:51.534
References for you as a chef
and bank account details.

51:51.853 --> 51:53.089
Ten thousand dollars?

51:53.845 --> 51:54.921
Well, it's not a sheep station,

51:54.941 --> 51:58.059
but it's enough to keep you going
till you find a job.

51:58.079 --> 52:01.021
Blow that all in one night
if my luck turned south.

52:01.046 --> 52:01.877
Hey!

52:01.893 --> 52:04.889
Don't worry, I won't. I hope.

52:05.913 --> 52:07.877
Thanks.

52:08.881 --> 52:10.925
Constable will take you
to the airport, if you're ready.

52:10.941 --> 52:12.885
OK.

52:14.925 --> 52:16.889
You ready?
Yep.

52:16.905 --> 52:21.861
Just hate leaving a game unfinished.

52:29.941 --> 52:31.909
Thanks, mate. Cheers.

52:37.889 --> 52:41.885
Well, goodbye, Sergeant.

52:41.901 --> 52:43.857
Good luck, Felix.

52:48.889 --> 52:50.893
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

53:00.921 --> 53:02.901
Oi, Steph.

53:02.917 --> 53:04.857
That game.

53:04.873 --> 53:06.857
You should make the next move.

53:59.897 --> 54:02.780
You cannot keep saying
that you have nothing to do

54:02.857 --> 54:04.845
with the tragedies
that happen around you!

54:04.865 --> 54:07.101
Please, we have the answers.
Please go.

54:07.121 --> 54:09.129
Answers hardly matter now.
We know who killed Todd.

54:09.149 --> 54:11.845
I think it's time.
What will you do?

54:11.861 --> 54:13.450
It's been an honour, Janet.

54:13.475 --> 54:14.885
It was you, wasn't it?

54:14.905 --> 54:16.893
The anonymous call
that could end my career.

54:16.913 --> 54:19.897
So what would it take for you
to be an ally rather than an enemy?

54:19.917 --> 54:22.865
I have no choice
but to suspend this royal commission

54:22.885 --> 54:25.857
and all current operations
will cease immediately.

54:25.873 --> 54:27.579
So really I have two choices.

54:27.604 --> 54:30.905
Resignation or a completely ruined
reputation.
