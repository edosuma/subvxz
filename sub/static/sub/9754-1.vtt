00:27.488 --> 00:30.275
I just met you

00:30.366 --> 00:32.572
Yet I'm feeling

00:32.659 --> 00:36.871
It seems that somehow
we met somewhere before

00:36.956 --> 00:39.743
I think I loved you

00:39.834 --> 00:44.294
In my dreams 100 times or maybe more

00:48.384 --> 00:50.092
What a connection

00:50.177 --> 00:52.336
I just can't conceal it

00:52.429 --> 00:55.300
There's a kind of magic in the air

00:55.391 --> 00:57.882
Ooh, I can feel it

00:57.977 --> 01:00.053
Something special

01:00.146 --> 01:04.095
Is gonna happen tonight

01:04.191 --> 01:07.311
I want you to know that

01:07.403 --> 01:09.645
Something special

01:09.738 --> 01:13.783
Is gonna happen tonight

01:13.868 --> 01:18.031
I promise I'll be good to you

01:26.547 --> 01:28.207
What a connection

01:28.299 --> 01:30.837
I just can't conceal it

01:30.926 --> 01:33.761
There's a kind of magic in the air

01:33.846 --> 01:36.218
Ooh, I can feel it

01:36.307 --> 01:38.632
Something special

01:38.726 --> 01:42.937
Is gonna happen tonight

01:43.022 --> 01:45.976
I want you to know that

01:46.066 --> 01:48.142
Something special

01:48.235 --> 01:52.280
Is gonna happen tonight

01:52.364 --> 01:55.449
I promise I'll be good to you

01:55.534 --> 01:57.574
Something special

01:57.661 --> 02:01.576
Is gonna happen tonight

02:37.409 --> 02:40.446
Oh! All right. That's it.

02:40.538 --> 02:44.238
- What's the matter, Marie? What happened?
- She tried to kill me.

02:44.333 --> 02:47.085
- Well, isn't that the point?
- No, Lauren.

02:47.169 --> 02:51.416
This is theatrical fencing.
This isn't an autopsy. All right?

02:52.758 --> 02:54.418
All right.

02:54.510 --> 02:57.427
Damn it! I don't even know
why we have to do this.

02:57.513 --> 03:00.549
If you want to do Shakespeare,
Shakespearean people have duels.

03:00.641 --> 03:04.508
- Not the women.
- It's my ambition to play Hamlet.

03:04.603 --> 03:07.308
Oh, that'll pack 'em in the aisles.

03:07.398 --> 03:09.474
Yes.

03:11.527 --> 03:13.603
Paulette.

03:15.239 --> 03:17.315
Lan.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.077
Good. Lauren.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.996
Excellent.

03:33.048 --> 03:35.124
Naomi.

03:36.552 --> 03:38.628
Bitch.

03:42.224 --> 03:44.300
- Lauren.
- Hi, George.

03:44.393 --> 03:47.513
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- What?

03:47.605 --> 03:51.554
- Say, "Yes."
- George.

03:51.650 --> 03:55.066
- Say, "Yes."
- Why are you acting like this?

03:56.363 --> 03:59.033
Because I wanna be with you.

03:59.116 --> 04:01.192
Well, that's nice.

04:03.496 --> 04:06.165
This is so funny, George.
I thought you were gay.

04:06.248 --> 04:10.246
Oh, I am. It's just, I play
so many heterosexual roles...

04:10.336 --> 04:14.203
I feel I really need to
do some serious research.

04:15.382 --> 04:17.255
Mm-hmm.

04:17.343 --> 04:19.418
And just when you think
there's no greater depth...

04:19.512 --> 04:21.588
to which an actor could possibly sink.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.595
- That's nothin'. Remember Fred?
- Fred.

04:25.684 --> 04:28.010
I've got a 50 percent
hearing loss in this ear...

04:28.103 --> 04:31.307
from him yelling "Stella" in bed.

04:31.398 --> 04:34.269
I tell ya, I swore
off actors a year ago.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.479
I said if that's the only
subspecies of men available...

04:37.571 --> 04:39.813
I'd rather not date at all.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.398
And I haven't. But
there are other things.

04:42.493 --> 04:46.621
My work, I perfect my craft.
L... Kor... Korzenowski!

04:46.705 --> 04:49.955
- Yeah.
- He's taking students.

04:50.042 --> 04:53.577
- Hey, but where you gonna get that kind of money?
- L...

04:53.671 --> 04:57.205
I gotta use that phone.
Come on. You're up.

05:03.389 --> 05:05.465
Who is it?

05:05.558 --> 05:08.677
It's your sister-in-law. Hurry
up. My feet are falling off.

05:08.769 --> 05:11.687
Well, hi, Shirley.
I'm glad you finally...

05:11.772 --> 05:13.848
Wait a minute.

05:13.941 --> 05:17.061
Get in front of the camera.

05:22.366 --> 05:25.320
- I knew it.
- Come on, Mom. Let me in.

05:25.411 --> 05:28.412
No, we can't afford it.

05:28.497 --> 05:30.573
Mom, please.

05:30.666 --> 05:32.742
- Is that my baby?
- Daddy!

05:32.835 --> 05:35.955
Yes, but she can't come
in. She wants a loan.

05:36.046 --> 05:38.122
Daddy, can I come in, please?

05:38.215 --> 05:40.920
Please, please, please,
please, please, Daddy? Daddy?

05:41.010 --> 05:43.086
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Oh, yes.

05:43.179 --> 05:46.096
- You don't know she wants money.
- Of course she does.

05:46.182 --> 05:49.515
- You don't know that.
- That's right, Mom.

05:49.602 --> 05:53.516
Can't I just drop in to see my parents?

05:56.483 --> 05:58.772
Okay, I need $5,000.

05:58.861 --> 06:01.778
- But it's to study with Korzenowski. -
$5,000. - She might have a good reason.

06:01.864 --> 06:05.612
- Daddy! Stanislav Korzenowski.
- $5,000, Daniel.

06:05.701 --> 06:08.192
- I'll pay you back.
- What did you say?

06:08.287 --> 06:10.363
W
- What was that?

06:11.916 --> 06:16.993
- I know I owe you some money.
- You owe us $3 2,000.

06:17.087 --> 06:19.923
But it's the Korzenowski.

06:20.007 --> 06:24.384
Lauren, we sent you to Yale
and London and the institute.

06:24.470 --> 06:28.337
You have been at this acting thing for
years, and you haven't earned a dime.

06:28.432 --> 06:30.508
You are still working as a salesgirl!

06:30.601 --> 06:33.602
- Honey, face it. Maybe it's time for you to give it up.
- Daddy.

06:33.687 --> 06:36.178
- Daniel. Hey, what did you
do? - Oh. Oh, Daddy. - Nothing.

06:36.273 --> 06:38.764
- You gave her that money? - Oh, Daddy.
- I cannot believe that you did that.

06:38.859 --> 06:42.311
- She is our only child. - Oh. Oh, Daddy!
- I can't believe it. She is sucking us dry.

06:42.404 --> 06:45.524
- $5,000. Thank you, Daddy!
- She isn't. Well, I just got another bill from Bloomingdale's.

06:45.616 --> 06:47.692
- Oh, thank you.
- Drop that now. Don't you dare start talking about that.

06:50.704 --> 06:54.453
Give me back my fuckin' quarter! Damn!

06:55.751 --> 06:57.827
Well, good luck.

07:08.138 --> 07:09.798
I'm Lauren Ames.

07:09.890 --> 07:12.179
There's my application,
your board, your pen.

07:12.268 --> 07:15.269
- Thank you.
- And my down payment.

07:15.354 --> 07:18.438
Keep that for now. You
still have to audition.

07:18.524 --> 07:21.015
- Right.
- Sit down. Mr Korzenowski will call you.

07:21.110 --> 07:23.186
Thank you.

07:29.952 --> 07:32.241
You nervous? Sorry. I'm sorry.

07:32.329 --> 07:36.078
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay. No, I'm... I'm not... It's fine.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.539
I guess we're all a little bit, uh...

07:38.627 --> 07:40.834
Don't talk. Right.

07:40.921 --> 07:43.412
Oh, boy. I don't blame you.

07:44.884 --> 07:47.505
This is so intense. Shut up, Weldon.

07:47.595 --> 07:50.465
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Holy Mary!

07:50.556 --> 07:53.889
Isn't there one fucking phone
in this whole town that works?

07:55.311 --> 07:57.387
You got a phone I can use?

08:06.614 --> 08:09.947
Yeah, hi. This is Sandy
Brozinsky. Who's this?

08:10.034 --> 08:14.281
Howie. Okay, Howie. I'm holding
in my hand this thingee...

08:14.371 --> 08:16.862
says you're gonna turn
off my phone at noon.

08:16.957 --> 08:18.997
Oh, yeah? Well, I wanna
tell you somethin'.

08:19.084 --> 08:20.958
I just got out of the hospital.

08:21.045 --> 08:23.121
I get home after two
months of intensive care...

08:23.214 --> 08:26.547
they wheel me into my
building, I open my mailbox...

08:26.634 --> 08:31.212
I find your thingee screaming at
me I have till 12 noon today...

08:31.305 --> 08:33.712
Hey, no, you listen. You listen!

08:33.807 --> 08:36.927
I just opened the damn thing. I just
now laid eyes on it for the first time.

08:38.770 --> 08:40.431
What was I supposed to do?

08:40.523 --> 08:43.856
Have 'em unhook the life-support
machine so I could pay my bills?

08:45.528 --> 08:49.691
Oh, really? Yeah, so now I have
three... No, make that two minutes...

08:49.782 --> 08:52.487
to write a check and wheel
myself down to your office?

08:52.576 --> 08:54.652
Howie, is that the drill?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.289
24 hours?

09:02.378 --> 09:04.536
24 big ones?

09:04.630 --> 09:07.121
All right, Howie. You're
a prince among men.

09:07.216 --> 09:09.588
I mean it. I wanna have your child.

09:09.677 --> 09:11.135
Yeah, bye.

09:16.016 --> 09:18.305
No, stop!

09:19.395 --> 09:23.558
Please, do not screech at anyone else.

09:25.818 --> 09:28.225
I am trying to prepare
for an audition here.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.396
Thank you.

09:30.489 --> 09:32.731
Oh, yeah? What for?

09:32.825 --> 09:35.742
A workshop with Stanislav Korzenowski.

09:35.828 --> 09:38.283
Who's that?

09:38.372 --> 09:41.373
Only one of the great
geniuses of the theatre.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.617
Now if you don't mind.

09:43.711 --> 09:46.914
Hey, maybe I should audition
for him too. I'm an actress.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.884
Hey, no, I'm a pro. I bet
I'm more of a pro than you.

09:55.389 --> 10:00.181
Uh-huh. Well, I just made
2,500 bucks doin' a movie, yeah.

10:00.269 --> 10:03.887
That's where I've seen you.
It has been driving me crazy.

10:03.981 --> 10:08.524
- You saw Ninja Vixens?
- I, uh, must have.

10:08.611 --> 10:11.730
Huh. Well, this whole acting
thing's been goin' pretty good.

10:11.822 --> 10:14.693
I mean, it's all just
bullshittin', right?

10:16.118 --> 10:18.526
Actors are just
bullshitters who get paid.

10:18.621 --> 10:20.697
Where do I sign up?

10:22.291 --> 10:25.411
Just exactly what do you think
you're going to do in there?

10:25.502 --> 10:28.420
I don't know. I'll make somethin' up.

10:28.505 --> 10:32.455
You're going in to Stanislav
Korzenowski and wing it?

10:33.677 --> 10:36.168
Jesus, you'd think I was
gonna go in and pee on him.

10:38.015 --> 10:40.091
Listen to me.

10:40.184 --> 10:44.134
You do not audition for a man
of Korzenowski's reputation...

10:44.230 --> 10:46.306
without a prepared classical monologue.

10:46.398 --> 10:48.605
That means Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare.

10:48.692 --> 10:52.227
I'm doing Ophelia's mad scene. I'm
not waltzing in off the street...

10:52.321 --> 10:55.856
saying, "Gee, I think
I wanna be an actress."

10:56.992 --> 10:59.068
You know what I bet?

10:59.161 --> 11:02.079
I bet you haven't been
laid in about a year.

11:06.377 --> 11:09.710
- Ames, Lauren.
- Ah, ah.

11:09.797 --> 11:12.917
Yes, I'm coming. I'm...
I'm... I will be co...

11:13.008 --> 11:15.962
I'm... I'm... I'm ready. I'm... I'm...

11:16.053 --> 11:18.971
- I'm ready.
- Quickly, Miss Ames.

11:19.056 --> 11:21.547
I have a good mad scene.

11:22.184 --> 11:24.806
It's really great. I just saw it.

11:24.895 --> 11:26.971
Hmm.

11:53.174 --> 11:58.381
I will not only wish you to
absorb everything that I say.

11:58.471 --> 12:03.465
I will also wish you to keep
notes of everything that I say.

12:03.559 --> 12:08.351
And I will wish to look at those notes.

12:08.439 --> 12:12.816
Now if you say this
is like high school...

12:12.902 --> 12:14.978
I do not apologize.

12:17.072 --> 12:19.148
I am an old egotist...

12:19.241 --> 12:22.693
and I want to know that
you record my ideas.

12:23.746 --> 12:27.281
If you do not, you're
gone from the class.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.076
All right. We begin.

12:30.169 --> 12:35.127
We begin with vowel groups.

12:35.216 --> 12:37.707
Vowel groups.

12:38.761 --> 12:40.837
Mr Weldon...

12:41.889 --> 12:45.887
do you know the difference
between a Texas diphthong...

12:45.976 --> 12:48.467
and a Georgia diphthong?

12:50.189 --> 12:51.600
Sorry I'm late.

12:51.690 --> 12:55.902
They made me fill out all these
dumb-ass financial aid forms.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.112
You want 'em?

12:57.112 --> 12:57.646
You want 'em?

12:57.738 --> 13:00.858
I cannot believe... I absolutely
cannot believe he let her in!

13:00.950 --> 13:03.026
And on scholarship!

13:03.118 --> 13:06.036
I just bet I know what
she did as an audition.

13:07.081 --> 13:10.082
The woman has no
training, no experience.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.041
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.

13:12.127 --> 13:14.416
I really thought if you
worked at your craft, maybe...

13:14.505 --> 13:16.794
just possibly, you'd get to
work with one of the greats.

13:16.882 --> 13:20.631
It's $2.95, not $295.

13:20.719 --> 13:22.795
I knew that.

13:25.474 --> 13:29.057
Something's seriously
wrong with my life.

13:29.144 --> 13:31.470
Excuse me.

13:33.524 --> 13:36.774
- Are you all right?
- Better.

13:39.113 --> 13:41.070
L-I w... I was just, um...

13:41.156 --> 13:43.233
- Who cares? May I help you?
- Yeah.

13:43.325 --> 13:47.109
- Have you got something in a pumpkin?
- The shade pumpkin?

13:47.204 --> 13:50.490
- No, a pumpkin costume.
- Oh.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.659
God, I sound like an idiot.

13:52.751 --> 13:54.827
The reason is that I
teach grammar school.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.079
- You're a
schoolteacher? - Uh-huh.

13:57.172 --> 13:59.960
- You're not an actor?
- Oh, God, no. I'd be awful.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.924
Why do you ask?

14:02.011 --> 14:05.462
Oh, well, there's just so many
actors who come in here. Please go on.

14:05.556 --> 14:07.632
Well, we're putting
on a little pageant...

14:07.725 --> 14:10.476
and there's a kid in my
class who's very insecure.

14:10.561 --> 14:12.968
You know, the other kids pick on
him and his mother doesn't sew...

14:13.063 --> 14:15.139
and I think it would
give him such a boost...

14:15.232 --> 14:17.521
to have the best darn
costume in the place.

14:17.610 --> 14:22.236
So I thought a professional costumers
would have an incredible pumpkin.

14:23.282 --> 14:25.358
But I can't go more than $50...

14:25.451 --> 14:27.739
because this is coming
out of my own pocket.

14:30.539 --> 14:33.291
I'm really sorry. I don't
think we have a pumpkin.

14:34.877 --> 14:37.415
What about a squash?

14:37.504 --> 14:40.624
We don't have any vegetables as such.

14:41.383 --> 14:43.257
I'm sorry.

14:43.344 --> 14:45.835
Well, this is the
last place on the list.

14:47.014 --> 14:50.679
But I'll just throw something
together myself, huh?

14:50.768 --> 14:53.341
I really appreciate your time. Thanks.

14:53.437 --> 14:57.304
Um, uh, listen. I don't know,
maybe, uh, maybe someone...

14:57.399 --> 15:01.527
Maybe I could, uh... I've
made a lot of my own costumes.

15:01.612 --> 15:05.859
I'm sure it wouldn't be that
difficult. If I could help out, I'd...

15:05.950 --> 15:08.026
like to.

15:08.118 --> 15:10.325
That would be fabulous.

15:21.006 --> 15:23.628
- I hope you'll forgive me, Lauren.
- For what?

15:23.717 --> 15:26.837
L... I don't usually
lunge at women like that.

15:26.929 --> 15:29.764
- Oh.
- But you just, uh...

15:32.351 --> 15:34.640
I just had to kiss you.

15:34.728 --> 15:37.848
L-I really am sorry and I hope
that you'll want to see me again.

15:37.940 --> 15:42.187
Oh, where in the world
did you come from?

15:42.278 --> 15:45.812
- New Mexico, originally.
- No, no, I mean...

15:45.906 --> 15:48.195
how can a man so delightful as you...

15:48.284 --> 15:52.447
be just wandering the
streets of New York?

15:52.538 --> 15:55.658
Single, single, yeah.
I can't believe it.

15:55.749 --> 15:58.916
Well, that's not by choice.
I'd like to be married.

15:59.962 --> 16:03.331
- This isn't happening.
- Why not?

16:03.424 --> 16:06.757
Well, there must be something wrong
with you. Don't you have any faults?

16:08.554 --> 16:11.045
I smoke.

16:12.308 --> 16:15.558
You smoke? That's it? Call the police!

16:15.644 --> 16:19.179
No, no, no. It's an addiction.

16:19.273 --> 16:23.223
Colton's tobacco. New Mexico's finest.

16:23.319 --> 16:25.810
I hope you don't mind.

16:25.905 --> 16:29.819
Well, I'll struggle through somehow.

16:31.744 --> 16:33.617
Good. Very good.

16:33.704 --> 16:36.824
Because, uh, I'd like
to see you again...

16:38.542 --> 16:40.618
tomorrow night.

16:42.588 --> 16:44.664
Well, yes.

16:54.642 --> 16:57.346
Mmm, thank you.

17:01.732 --> 17:04.436
What's this?

17:04.526 --> 17:09.319
"Ooh, eee, ooh, ah, ooh, eee, ah, ooh."

17:09.406 --> 17:12.359
- That's what you do in acting class?
- Those are vowel groups.

17:12.451 --> 17:16.496
Mmm, sorry. "Wowel" groups.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.537
- Ooh. -
Ooh. - Ooh.

17:18.624 --> 17:21.790
- Ooh, I feel the same way.
- Ooh, ooh.

17:21.877 --> 17:24.997
Will you please kiss
me hard on the lips?

17:27.174 --> 17:29.665
That was tender, but tasty.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.251
- Bite my face.
- Okay.

17:33.848 --> 17:38.011
Bite my leg. Now bite my other leg.

17:41.272 --> 17:44.605
- You get her two 1 X legs and...
- Going over the fence gymnastics?

17:44.692 --> 17:46.980
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

17:48.237 --> 17:51.688
Oh, my. That kind of evening, huh?

17:54.285 --> 17:58.069
Not the kind you're used
to. No money changed hands.

18:08.674 --> 18:11.379
No, no, no, no. Reveal, reveal.

18:11.468 --> 18:14.802
You have killed your father.
You have married your mother.

18:14.889 --> 18:17.380
Na, no words, remember.

18:18.434 --> 18:20.307
Na, reveal.

18:29.653 --> 18:32.939
Here we have a sick sea lion. Go.

18:34.867 --> 18:38.318
- Miss Brozinsky.
- Okay.

18:38.412 --> 18:42.362
You will now perform for
us, also without words...

18:42.458 --> 18:45.031
Hamlet's soliloquy.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.619
Who's that?

18:48.714 --> 18:50.790
Hamlet.

18:52.343 --> 18:54.419
Hamlet.

18:55.888 --> 18:58.758
Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.343
Ah, well.

19:05.439 --> 19:08.559
Uh, for her, we get the comic book, huh?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.869
Taxi!

19:18.953 --> 19:20.826
Hey!

19:30.631 --> 19:32.090
Hey!

19:32.174 --> 19:35.958
Oh. Ooh, that creep
Korzenowski is driving me nuts.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.295
Ooh.

19:38.389 --> 19:41.390
I know what I need.

19:48.065 --> 19:50.983
Oh, God!

19:51.068 --> 19:53.144
Oh, God!

19:53.237 --> 19:56.154
Oh, God! Oh, God!

19:56.240 --> 19:58.114
Oh, God!

19:58.200 --> 20:02.743
Oh, God! Oh, God!

20:02.830 --> 20:04.906
Ooh.

20:11.714 --> 20:14.833
To die on the stage...

20:16.260 --> 20:19.795
is perhaps the greatest
single challenge...

20:19.889 --> 20:22.380
an actor can face.

20:25.477 --> 20:29.855
The audience must know,
must absolutely believe...

20:29.940 --> 20:32.645
that the breath, that the very life...

20:32.735 --> 20:35.142
is going out of your body.

20:35.237 --> 20:37.313
Now...

20:37.406 --> 20:41.653
You! You will die now, please.

20:42.494 --> 20:45.448
No, no, I don't believe you.

20:47.333 --> 20:51.081
Maintain your focus.
Na, I don't believe you.

20:51.170 --> 20:55.796
- Maintain your focus and lean forward.
- Stop, stop, stop. Stop it. Stop it.

20:59.553 --> 21:02.388
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

21:06.977 --> 21:11.057
Perhaps you would like to
die for us now, Miss Ames.

21:12.107 --> 21:16.152
You, I think, I will shoot.

21:17.404 --> 21:21.023
You will feel the
bullet enter your body.

21:21.116 --> 21:24.450
You will lose all muscle control.

21:24.536 --> 21:28.202
You will fall down dead.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.534
Bang.

21:45.432 --> 21:48.682
This can only be the achievement...

21:48.769 --> 21:51.260
of years of training.

21:54.108 --> 21:59.731
No other way would we ever
see so false a performance.

21:59.822 --> 22:03.155
So mechanical, so thought-out.

22:03.242 --> 22:07.785
Never for one moment truly felt.

22:07.872 --> 22:13.079
Here, you must reach
deep inside yourself.

22:13.168 --> 22:16.668
You must go beyond the
safety of what you know.

22:16.755 --> 22:19.246
We know you can act, Camille...

22:19.341 --> 22:23.802
but can you be a person
of flesh and blood?

22:23.888 --> 22:26.260
Ah, time.

22:27.558 --> 22:30.049
We die again tomorrow.

22:30.144 --> 22:33.061
And, uh, please, give me your notebooks.

22:33.147 --> 22:35.223
I wish to see them.

22:38.819 --> 22:41.310
You can't walk there!

22:41.405 --> 22:44.739
Hey, Ed, you want the delivery or not?

22:44.825 --> 22:47.114
The man is a Nazi.

22:49.371 --> 22:53.120
I have never been the
dumbest in any class before.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.165
I haven't seen you for nine hours.

22:59.381 --> 23:03.130
Taxi!

23:04.637 --> 23:06.843
Taxi!

23:06.931 --> 23:08.674
Mmm.

23:08.766 --> 23:11.304
- You know what today is?
- No.

23:11.393 --> 23:14.181
It's our third-week anniversary.

23:14.271 --> 23:16.893
- Stop on the next corner.
- You got it.

23:16.982 --> 23:21.276
- I think you need some roses.
- Oh, no, no, you can't afford any more flowers.

23:21.362 --> 23:23.438
- Right here.
- No, don't stop.

23:23.531 --> 23:26.022
- Half... Half a dozen.
- No, don't stop. I know what teachers make.

23:26.116 --> 23:28.192
Don't stop.

23:42.675 --> 23:44.751
Michael!

23:46.762 --> 23:49.798
A crowd is gathered here. Traffic
is backed up for two blocks.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.935
Killed in the explosion are Lee
Veran, the owner of the flower shop...

23:54.019 --> 23:58.397
and Michael Santers, a teacher
at Holmes Elementary School.

23:58.482 --> 24:01.898
Two terrorist groups have claimed
responsibility for the blast.

24:02.570 --> 24:07.860
It's all right, Miss Ames. We've
got a positive ID from his wallet.

24:07.950 --> 24:10.192
You don't have to see him.

24:10.286 --> 24:12.990
I want to see him.

24:19.253 --> 24:24.045
I warn you, there's
very little left to see.

24:24.133 --> 24:28.296
Particularly in the,
uh, upper body region.

24:30.139 --> 24:32.012
I wanna see him.

24:32.099 --> 24:36.678
I'm very sorry you
feel a need to do this.

24:36.770 --> 24:39.475
Just leave me alone with him, please.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.496
What are you doing here?

24:59.585 --> 25:03.168
- Me? What the fuck are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.

25:03.255 --> 25:05.544
- I am in mourning.
- Well, so am I!

25:05.633 --> 25:09.167
- For my lover.
- Well, so am I!

25:12.264 --> 25:15.384
- Who?
- Michael Santers.

25:15.476 --> 25:19.639
- No, no, you little witch! No!
- You bitch, you didn't know him!

25:19.730 --> 25:22.102
- Oh, he loved me.
- How could you lie, little bitch?

25:22.191 --> 25:26.058
- Oh, get away from me! Oh!
- Get out of here right now!

25:26.153 --> 25:30.945
- I'm gonna bitch-slap you! I'm gonna break
every bone in your body! - Oh, you are?

25:31.033 --> 25:33.738
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am!

25:36.080 --> 25:38.487
How dare you! How dare you!

25:40.042 --> 25:42.118
- Oh. Ooh.
- He loved me.

25:42.211 --> 25:44.453
He loved me!

25:44.546 --> 25:46.788
Loved you? Loved you?

25:46.882 --> 25:49.552
- Damn right he did!
- Ha, that's obscene.

25:49.635 --> 25:53.467
No, that's reality, baby, 'cause no
way did that guy give a shit about you!

25:55.224 --> 25:59.387
I refuse to believe for one
second that he would lower himself.

25:59.478 --> 26:03.227
Oh, he lowered himself, all right.

26:03.315 --> 26:07.942
This is all a lie. You are
psychotic. Yes, that's right.

26:08.028 --> 26:11.148
I've known from the first time I
saw you sleaze into that office.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.482
You lied to that phone man...

26:13.576 --> 26:16.197
you lied your way into the
class and you're lying now.

26:16.287 --> 26:18.778
- I'm gonna get you for this!
- Whoa!

26:18.873 --> 26:20.865
Whoa, my... Oh!

26:45.566 --> 26:47.642
Well, what the hell?

26:47.735 --> 26:50.440
- Well, that's not his...
- No way. Look at that.

26:50.529 --> 26:54.278
- It's too small.
- It's a fuckin' pencil.

26:54.366 --> 26:58.115
- Where's the appendix scar?
- And that little mole?

26:59.163 --> 27:01.654
It's somebody else! He's alive!

27:01.749 --> 27:03.825
He's alive! He's a...

27:06.086 --> 27:09.290
Well, thank you. Wait a minute,
wait a minute. This was my idea.

27:09.381 --> 27:11.457
I don't care, I'm gonna handle this.

27:11.550 --> 27:13.709
You don't have the dimmest,
dullest notion how to handle this.

27:13.802 --> 27:16.340
You can't just walk in and bluntly
announce this kind of thing.

27:16.430 --> 27:18.506
Thing, thing. What kind of
thing are you talking about?

27:18.599 --> 27:21.516
You can't even say it. You
sure as hell can't tell 'em.

27:21.602 --> 27:24.852
And just what do you think the
response is going to be when you do?

27:28.108 --> 27:30.018
You suggest...

27:30.110 --> 27:31.984
You suggest...

27:36.533 --> 27:41.445
You suggest that on the basis of
this little nugget of testimony...

27:41.539 --> 27:45.702
we spend tax dollars
on an investigation?

27:46.794 --> 27:48.870
Have you been listening to us?

27:48.963 --> 27:53.091
The man in the morgue could
not possibly be Michael Santers.

27:53.175 --> 27:56.295
All you have to do is look at his...

27:56.387 --> 27:58.593
If you were to look...

27:58.681 --> 28:01.053
in the region...

28:02.101 --> 28:04.140
If you were to look down.

28:06.772 --> 28:11.683
Michael was not a guy other guys would
have made fun of in a locker room, okay?

28:11.777 --> 28:17.068
- I think he's got the big picture now.
- Well, I don't think he does.

28:17.157 --> 28:20.075
This guy in the morgue, whoever he is...

28:20.160 --> 28:22.616
he's got, uh...

28:24.373 --> 28:26.449
Does the phrase "needle dick..."

28:26.542 --> 28:29.543
"the bug fucker," mean anything to you?

28:31.088 --> 28:32.962
- I beg your pardon!
- You big lunkhead!

28:33.048 --> 28:35.622
Now get outta here and don't come back.

28:36.677 --> 28:38.551
The model of tact and decorum.

28:38.637 --> 28:40.713
Oh, who gives a shit?
He wasn't gonna help us.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.842
Well, of course not! You sounded insane.

28:43.934 --> 28:46.852
Oh, it is insane.

28:46.937 --> 28:49.013
If he's alive, where is he?

28:49.106 --> 28:52.855
He's probably back at my house,
wonderin' where the hell I am.

28:52.943 --> 28:55.019
- Taxi! - Your
house? - Taxi!

28:55.112 --> 28:57.188
- Oh. - Taxi!
- Wait a minute.

28:57.281 --> 29:01.195
- W-W-Wait just a minute
here. - Come here! Taxi!

29:01.285 --> 29:03.776
I don't believe for one minute
that he's at your apartment.

29:03.871 --> 29:05.947
Oh, boy, are you gonna shit cement!

29:06.040 --> 29:08.957
Taxi! Taxi!

29:09.043 --> 29:12.993
If Michael is anywhere, I
assure you he is at my place.

29:13.088 --> 29:16.374
- Taxi, taxi!
- Oh, you believe that?

29:16.467 --> 29:20.167
I believe that he loved
me, that he barely knew you.

29:20.262 --> 29:23.927
And you're... you're fantasizing
a relationship that is probably...

29:24.016 --> 29:27.432
- an isolated, drunken encounter.
- Isolated? Isolated?

29:27.520 --> 29:30.271
Hey, this girl does not
have one-night stands.

29:30.356 --> 29:32.395
Every guy I have ever slept with...

29:32.483 --> 29:35.567
and we are way into double digits
here, has come back for more.

29:35.653 --> 29:38.144
Every single one!

29:38.239 --> 29:40.812
- You wanna hit me, right? - Oh, wouldn't
I just love it. - Okay, give it a try.

29:40.908 --> 29:43.743
Give it a try. Let's go, let's go.

29:43.828 --> 29:45.904
Bob and weave, honey. Bob and weave.

29:45.996 --> 29:48.570
- Who dresses you anyway?
- Okay, okay. Try it. Okay.

29:50.918 --> 29:56.588
Stand still, you little bitch. I'm
gonna bash your little WASP brains out.

29:56.674 --> 29:59.081
I'm gonna hit you. I'm gonna murder you.

29:59.176 --> 30:02.094
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Talk about dingbats.

30:02.179 --> 30:04.884
They'll lead us right to him.

30:06.976 --> 30:10.558
- Nine... Nine years of ballet!
- You're too weird to hit.

30:10.646 --> 30:13.018
- Taxi! - Oh, taxi!
- Taxi! - Taxi!

30:13.107 --> 30:16.108
Taxi! Well, now wait just
a minute. Wait just a...

30:16.193 --> 30:20.405
All right, all right. Okay, okay. You
insist Michael is at your apartment.

30:20.489 --> 30:22.778
I think he's at mine.
So we'll go to both.

30:22.866 --> 30:24.942
If he's at your place, which I doubt...

30:25.035 --> 30:27.111
then I will tell him
goodbye and good riddance.

30:27.204 --> 30:29.280
If on the other hand he's at mine...

30:29.373 --> 30:32.493
you will find yourself a nice
biker and compare tattoos.

30:41.719 --> 30:44.210
Oh!

30:44.305 --> 30:46.974
You see, he's here.
Now don't make a scene.

30:47.057 --> 30:49.762
Try to be adult about this.

30:56.734 --> 31:00.482
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, it's just thieves.

31:01.655 --> 31:04.407
Russian thieves?

31:05.451 --> 31:07.739
He was here.

31:09.246 --> 31:11.951
- Colton's?
- They're looking for Michael.

31:12.041 --> 31:14.662
Let me see.

31:25.763 --> 31:29.179
Hi, Mrs Hardy.

31:29.266 --> 31:31.722
- Who are these morons?
- I don't know.

31:31.810 --> 31:35.179
Stop! Come back!

31:35.272 --> 31:38.059
Oh, oh. Oh, God.

31:38.150 --> 31:40.641
- Oh, my God.
- Help me.

31:40.736 --> 31:42.812
Come on!

31:49.536 --> 31:51.197
Pretty baby.

32:14.061 --> 32:16.350
- Oh!
- Put it down. This isn't supposed to be up.

32:16.438 --> 32:19.807
Oh, damn! You messed up the thingee!

32:23.195 --> 32:26.481
You crazy bastards.

32:54.268 --> 32:56.889
Mr Atkins, these girls are
bimbos. They know nothing.

32:56.979 --> 32:59.055
- What do we want 'em for?
- They know he survived.

32:59.148 --> 33:01.437
They may know where he is. We
gotta get back on the trail.

33:01.525 --> 33:04.230
So we're gonna cover every
airport, every bus depot...

33:04.320 --> 33:06.775
every train station, every
car rental out of this city.

33:13.954 --> 33:17.288
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

33:24.590 --> 33:28.255
Well, so much for your
apartment. You wanna try mine?

33:35.267 --> 33:37.556
They've been here. Oh, my God.

33:37.645 --> 33:40.978
Wait a minute. Nobody's
been here. This is normal.

33:41.065 --> 33:45.109
- Come on. Geez!
- Oh, no.

33:45.194 --> 33:48.314
Michael? Michael?

33:48.405 --> 33:52.652
Michael? Michael? Mi...

33:53.285 --> 33:55.776
- He's not here.
- I'm going to find him.

33:55.871 --> 33:59.121
- Oh yeah? -
Yeah. - Where?

33:59.208 --> 34:01.580
Well, he... he could be hiding,
he could be hurt. I don't know.

34:01.669 --> 34:04.753
But I know that he needs
me. Now if you'll excuse me.

34:04.838 --> 34:07.674
Where you gonna look? His apartment?

34:07.758 --> 34:10.878
You think he's gonna be hangin' out at
his apartment, someone wants to kill him?

34:10.969 --> 34:13.840
Oh, well, I'm not
going to his apartment.

34:15.056 --> 34:19.219
- Then where are you going?
- Isn't that my business?

34:19.311 --> 34:21.600
Okay, look. Hold it, okay?

34:21.688 --> 34:24.524
All right, if you have an
idea, you might as well tell me.

34:24.608 --> 34:28.522
And we'll both go. We'll go find
him and we'll help him out of this.

34:28.612 --> 34:30.900
And then we'll make him choose.

34:30.989 --> 34:32.899
- Choose?
- Yeah.

34:32.992 --> 34:34.984
- Between us?
- Yeah.

34:36.620 --> 34:39.954
- I doubt that he'll know your name.
- Then we're on.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.623
I mean, you're so goddam sure it's
gonna be you, what do you care?

34:44.670 --> 34:47.243
I'm confident, yes.

34:48.299 --> 34:50.255
Well, so am I. So let's go.

34:50.342 --> 34:53.877
- Good.
- Oh, wait. I gotta fluff.

34:57.474 --> 35:00.475
Could you fluff a little faster?

35:00.561 --> 35:04.012
- What is that?
- I got it off a Christmas tree at Saks.

35:04.106 --> 35:08.056
- You defiled a Christmas tree?
- No one saw.

35:08.152 --> 35:10.773
What, nothing for the nose?

35:12.614 --> 35:15.948
Oh, Lady Di, explain this to me.

35:16.035 --> 35:19.368
The man's afraid for his life.
He's not gonna stop and buy tobacco.

35:19.455 --> 35:23.618
Oh, you obviously didn't spend the
kind of time with Michael that I did.

35:23.709 --> 35:27.754
- He... He couldn't last a day without his Colton's.
- I knew that.

35:27.838 --> 35:30.543
Uh-huh. Did you also know this is the
only place in town that carries it?

35:30.633 --> 35:32.958
- I didn't know that.
- No, no, you didn't.

35:33.052 --> 35:37.263
Now, listen. This time,
let me handle this.

35:37.348 --> 35:39.839
Your simplest exchanges with
people become pornographic.

35:39.934 --> 35:43.184
- That is a fucking lie.
- Need I say more.

35:43.270 --> 35:45.346
Excuse me, sir.

35:45.439 --> 35:47.977
Yeah, I know the guy.

35:48.067 --> 35:50.902
Have you seen him? Was he here today?

35:50.986 --> 35:53.145
Yeah, maybe.

35:53.239 --> 35:55.777
Maybe not.

35:57.034 --> 36:00.070
When do you think you
might arrive at a decision?

36:00.162 --> 36:03.614
Uh, over a drink?

36:03.707 --> 36:07.871
Mm-hmm. Wouldn't you feel
better, as a person...

36:07.962 --> 36:12.588
just unselfishly helping somebody find
out something she really needs to know?

36:13.884 --> 36:16.091
No. How 'bout dinner?

36:17.262 --> 36:20.596
- How 'bout a blow job?
- How 'bout a...

36:20.683 --> 36:25.391
- What did you say?
- Right here. Right now. Both of us.

36:25.479 --> 36:29.892
Kind of, uh, taking turns.

36:32.278 --> 36:34.769
- He was in here this afternoon.
- This afternoon?

36:34.863 --> 36:37.152
- You sure it was this afternoon?
- Yeah, right at my lunch break.

36:37.241 --> 36:39.530
1:00. He bought 10 pouches of Colton's.

36:39.618 --> 36:42.109
- What else?
- Nothing. He was kinda in a hurry.

36:42.204 --> 36:44.280
He used the phone and then
he ran right out of here.

36:44.373 --> 36:46.745
He used the phone at 1:00? Is that it?

36:46.834 --> 36:49.954
That's all she wrote, baby.

36:51.922 --> 36:54.627
Here or in the back?

36:54.717 --> 36:57.920
I think I can take care of it from here.

36:58.971 --> 37:01.129
Couple of floozies!

37:01.223 --> 37:03.512
Oh, my God.

37:03.601 --> 37:07.135
- That is the most disgusting, unscrup...
- What is your problem now?

37:07.229 --> 37:11.606
Promising sexual favours? That
sends us back to the Dark Ages.

37:11.692 --> 37:13.768
It's something you simply do not do!

37:13.861 --> 37:17.194
You do if you're lying.
Besides, it worked.

37:21.368 --> 37:23.444
Excuse me, but I must
have missed something.

37:23.537 --> 37:26.242
How exactly did it work?
We're at a dead end.

37:26.332 --> 37:28.822
- You'll see. - I'll see?
- Howie Rinker, please.

37:28.917 --> 37:32.867
- Oh, Howie.
- How! San!

37:32.963 --> 37:35.252
- Great, how 'bout you?
- Hey, Frankie, wanna paper?

37:35.341 --> 37:38.128
Yeah? How's your fish?

37:38.218 --> 37:40.507
Uh-huh. What'd the vet say?

37:40.596 --> 37:43.301
- What does a diseased fish have to...
- Stop it. It's in the bag.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.348
Listen, cutey.

37:45.434 --> 37:47.723
Seeing as how you're my main
man over at the phone company...

37:47.812 --> 37:50.848
I wanna ask you just a
teensy favour, all right?

37:50.940 --> 37:55.934
Can you tell me what number was called
out of Wally Frank Tobacconist at 1:00?

37:56.028 --> 37:59.978
- This afternoon. Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.
- This is good.

38:00.074 --> 38:03.822
It's probably one of those guys
with polyester pants and hips.

38:03.911 --> 38:05.987
- Yeah, I'm
here. - Uh-huh.

38:07.039 --> 38:09.115
- Good boy.
- All right.

38:10.584 --> 38:13.075
That's a cab company, right?

38:13.170 --> 38:15.246
Got it. Oh, you're a catch, How.

38:15.339 --> 38:17.711
Our kids are gonna be
gorgeous, you know that?

38:17.800 --> 38:20.635
- See you.
- Okay, don't gloat.

38:20.719 --> 38:22.379
Taxi!

38:34.066 --> 38:36.142
Is that all the money
you walk around with?

38:36.235 --> 38:40.612
Well, where's yours? I thought you
were the working pornographic actress.

38:40.698 --> 38:42.904
I went to the Bahamas.

38:45.661 --> 38:49.706
Hi. Can you help me? I,
uh... I'm such a ditz.

38:49.790 --> 38:52.993
L-I left my, uh, tennis racket
in one of your cabs today.

38:53.085 --> 38:56.786
Uh, I was picked up around,
uh, uh, 77th a-a-and Broadway...

38:56.881 --> 38:58.957
at 1:00.

38:59.049 --> 39:02.715
- Is there a
reward? - Yes. - No.

39:02.803 --> 39:05.092
Ooh! Ah!

39:05.180 --> 39:08.680
What the hell is goin' on? What
the hell you gonna do to me, huh?

39:08.767 --> 39:11.258
- What's wrong with you?
- Yo!

39:11.353 --> 39:13.844
Dipstick! There's your man.

39:13.939 --> 39:16.015
What?

39:17.485 --> 39:19.857
- Your turn.
- Come on, Rico. Back to work.

39:19.945 --> 39:22.863
- I don't wanna go back to work.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

39:22.948 --> 39:26.198
No, I can't talk to him.
I went to a private school.

39:26.285 --> 39:29.451
Hey, he looks like a
prince. He's gonna love you.

39:36.086 --> 39:38.375
Hi.

39:38.464 --> 39:41.963
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about a fare...

39:42.051 --> 39:44.755
you might've had earlier in the day.

39:44.845 --> 39:47.799
A very attractive Cauca-ca...

39:50.267 --> 39:53.802
Just "person" will do nicely,
won't it? Why differentiate?

39:53.896 --> 39:58.641
You would have picked him up, uh,
right outside a little smoke shop.

40:00.194 --> 40:03.064
Does that ring any bells of any kind?

40:03.155 --> 40:06.939
Whatsoever? Hello?

40:07.993 --> 40:10.365
- Tall dude? -
Yes. - Tweed coat?

40:10.454 --> 40:12.992
Yes, yes. A tweed coat, right.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.117
I don't remember a thing.

40:16.210 --> 40:19.709
- No, no, you just said a tall dude...
- I didn't say nothin'.

40:19.797 --> 40:23.332
Oh, come on now. Don't give
me a big song and dance.

40:23.426 --> 40:25.632
Oh, no.

40:30.724 --> 40:33.096
Yeah. Oh, my God.

40:33.185 --> 40:35.759
- He's going to hurt us.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

40:35.854 --> 40:39.223
Why should he help us
with nothin' in it for him?

40:39.316 --> 40:42.353
All right, you tell
me. What should I do?

40:42.445 --> 40:46.276
You're an actress. Bullshit him.

40:46.365 --> 40:50.659
I don't use my training
to tell lies to people.

40:50.744 --> 40:55.537
Well, what do you use it
for? Geez, it's so simple.

40:57.251 --> 41:00.702
Hey, how'd you like to
make a quick 200 bucks?

41:00.796 --> 41:03.714
- Say what?
- 200 bucks, cash...

41:03.799 --> 41:07.382
to take us to where
you, uh, took the guy.

41:11.557 --> 41:16.100
Are you out of your
mind? We don't have $200.

41:16.187 --> 41:18.938
Ah, chill out, would ya?

41:20.399 --> 41:22.308
Where are we?

41:22.401 --> 41:27.229
We've been going for miles, and I haven't
seen a single white person on the street.

41:27.323 --> 41:30.905
There's one. Oops, they got him.

41:30.993 --> 41:33.401
That's not funny.

41:44.381 --> 41:47.217
- Oh, my God.
- You sure this is it?

41:49.595 --> 41:53.593
Hey, keep your pants on. We're
coming right out, all right?

41:55.184 --> 42:00.640
Look, you know and I know I'm never gonna get
another cab to come out here to Vietnam, cue ball.

42:00.731 --> 42:03.400
So get real, all right?

42:03.484 --> 42:06.687
All right, I'll give you 300 bucks.

42:06.779 --> 42:09.104
Three hundred bucks just to
sit here till we get back.

42:09.198 --> 42:11.190
Three hundred?

42:11.283 --> 42:13.442
You're a real pain in
the ass. You know that?

42:13.535 --> 42:17.580
- Gonna break his neck. I'm gonna break his neck.
- Beyond belief.

42:17.665 --> 42:20.286
- You're really determined to have us killed, aren't you?
- Hey, get over yourself.

42:20.376 --> 42:22.250
- He's not gonna kill us.
- Oh? Why not?

42:22.336 --> 42:26.084
- 'Cause we're gonna be raped and murdered in this building.
- Oh!

42:28.467 --> 42:31.634
Oh! Ohh.

42:31.720 --> 42:36.181
Oh, no. Oh. Is that urine on the floor?

42:36.267 --> 42:39.718
- What's a little urine?
- Freeze!

42:39.812 --> 42:44.141
- Oh, my God, he's just a child.
- Well, at least rape's out.

42:44.233 --> 42:48.444
Let me do this. Do you really think you
should be playing with your daddy's...

42:48.529 --> 42:51.648
Shut up! Where's your
money? Credit cards!

42:51.740 --> 42:54.907
- Revoked. Where do you think?
- Your bags.

42:54.994 --> 42:58.943
- Throw 'em over here.
- Oh, I love this bag.

43:02.793 --> 43:05.201
Ohh! Oh! Oh.

43:09.341 --> 43:12.011
I'm not hit. You little...

43:12.094 --> 43:14.217
Give me that, you little thug.

43:14.304 --> 43:17.590
- I'll be damned. -
What? - It's a fake. - Oh.

43:17.683 --> 43:20.352
- Where'd you get this?
- Santa.

43:20.436 --> 43:24.979
Oh, yeah? Well, if you want to see another
Christmas, you're gonna have to help us find someone.

43:31.822 --> 43:34.230
Shh.

43:51.258 --> 43:54.627
- Come on, man, stop begging.
- This was a mistake.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.425
Not any more.

43:57.514 --> 43:59.922
Police! You're under arrest!

44:01.185 --> 44:06.772
Don't even think about it. Don't even fuckin'
think about it, or I'll blow your fuckin' nuts off!

44:06.857 --> 44:11.104
Do we understand each
other? Okay, turn around.

44:11.195 --> 44:14.611
Face the wall. Do it.

44:14.698 --> 44:17.616
Do it! Do it! Do it!

44:17.701 --> 44:20.951
- Okay, frisk 'em.
- Frisk 'em?

44:24.792 --> 44:28.077
Damn. Busted by two broads.

44:28.170 --> 44:30.840
Nice buns, boys. You been working out?

44:38.972 --> 44:41.760
Read 'em their rights.

44:41.850 --> 44:44.176
You have...

44:44.270 --> 44:47.970
the right to remain silent...

44:48.065 --> 44:51.398
because anything you say can...

44:51.485 --> 44:54.403
and will be used against you.

44:54.488 --> 44:56.611
You, uh...

44:58.784 --> 45:03.446
Attorney. You have, uh, you
have the right to an attorney.

45:05.166 --> 45:07.952
- Shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it, I heard it.

45:08.043 --> 45:10.878
Hey, look, look, what do you
want? You got it. Just talk to me.

45:10.963 --> 45:13.288
You know, he's right. We could
make you a real sweet deal, baby.

45:13.382 --> 45:16.003
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard it.

45:16.093 --> 45:18.762
Wait a minute. Maybe they
can help us find Santers.

45:18.846 --> 45:21.930
- They don't know Santers.
- Michael Santers?

45:22.016 --> 45:25.716
The hell you say! He was just here.
He was just here a few hours ago.

45:25.811 --> 45:28.598
- Rat fixed him up with a passport.
- Ah, fuck you, Gilroy.

45:28.689 --> 45:33.849
- What the fuck you want me to say?
- Oh, we're in the phoney ID business as well. Ain't that nice?

45:33.944 --> 45:37.444
- What name was the passport under?
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.

45:37.531 --> 45:40.947
Oh, yeah? It's gonna be
kind of a short conversation.

45:41.035 --> 45:43.526
They'll have to squeegee
your brains off the wall.

45:43.620 --> 45:47.665
Yeah. You, uh, you
better tell her the name.

45:47.750 --> 45:51.368
- She's kinda cranky.
- Yeah. I got my period.

45:52.755 --> 45:55.756
- John Strauss.
- John Strauss.

45:55.841 --> 45:59.127
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, look, he's leaving town. That's all I know.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.889
Hey, look, I'm bein'
real nice here, huh?

46:01.972 --> 46:06.100
Why don't you be nice and,
uh, open that box on the table?

46:06.185 --> 46:08.142
Go on.

46:13.609 --> 46:16.729
- Now, look, why don't you just keep it?
- You givin' them the money?

46:16.821 --> 46:19.572
- Forget that we ever met.
- Are you sick?

46:19.656 --> 46:23.868
- Turn around!
- Yeah. Happy to.

46:26.580 --> 46:29.202
Well, I hate to give it to
you, but that was pretty good.

46:29.291 --> 46:31.580
Yeah, it was, it was.

46:35.506 --> 46:37.545
Yeah, yeah.

46:37.633 --> 46:41.216
Well, a deal's a deal.

46:41.303 --> 46:44.886
And now, my man, we
wanna go to the airport.

46:48.686 --> 46:50.678
The airport.

46:50.771 --> 46:54.389
- Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- They don't give out passenger lists.

46:54.483 --> 46:57.769
- You have to be police or FBI.
- You are such a dip.

46:57.862 --> 47:00.613
This is all the FBI we need.

47:00.698 --> 47:03.271
His luggage was totally
over the weight limit.

47:03.367 --> 47:07.531
Can you imagine the gall, trying
to bribe an airline official?

47:07.621 --> 47:10.539
He offered me $ 100
to let it go through.

47:10.624 --> 47:15.037
- Ah, what a world. I tell ya.
- This is the final boarding call for Eastern Airlines flight 501...

47:15.129 --> 47:20.004
- Watch and learn.
- To Albuquerque, now boarding at gate 4 2.

47:20.092 --> 47:24.968
Excuse, please. I was
hoping you would to help me.

47:25.055 --> 47:27.593
Uh...

47:27.683 --> 47:29.889
how... how do I to say?

47:29.977 --> 47:32.550
You say it quickly. I'm
off in three minutes.

47:33.814 --> 47:39.021
My father, he's coming here. We...
No, I tell you from the beginning.

47:39.111 --> 47:43.025
My name is Anna. This
is my sister Elona.

47:43.115 --> 47:45.784
My half-sister. She
does not speak English.

47:45.868 --> 47:50.446
My father, we have not seen him
since we was babies in Prague.

47:50.539 --> 47:54.786
He send us here in suitcase on train.

47:54.877 --> 47:57.913
We, uh, escape, you see?

47:58.005 --> 48:03.379
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Now we get letter.

48:03.469 --> 48:05.841
He escape.

48:05.929 --> 48:08.052
He is here.

48:08.140 --> 48:11.426
But we do not know where.
We do not know which plane.

48:11.519 --> 48:15.682
Could be any plane. Please,
you tell us which plane. Please?

48:15.773 --> 48:18.809
Absolutely not. I'm sorry.

48:40.798 --> 48:43.289
That was the single biggest crock...

48:43.384 --> 48:49.137
I've ever had the privilege to
hear in my 19 years at this airline.

48:50.516 --> 48:54.561
I think that deserves something.

48:54.645 --> 48:57.266
What was the name?

48:57.356 --> 49:01.899
- Strauss. John Strauss.
- John Strauss.

49:04.613 --> 49:07.021
- Here we
go. - Uh-huh.

49:07.116 --> 49:10.485
Flight 501 to Albuquerque.

49:10.577 --> 49:12.784
- Looks like you just missed him.
- Oh, no!

49:12.872 --> 49:17.450
Wait a minute, wait a minute. He took another
line through St Louis, and it's delayed.

49:20.129 --> 49:23.580
If I can put you on our flight
225 through Kansas City...

49:23.674 --> 49:25.168
- you can beat
him. - Yeah! - Aha!

49:25.259 --> 49:28.094
- But it's leaving in one minute.
- You get the tickets, I'll hold the plane.

49:28.178 --> 49:32.390
Oh, good, good. Two tickets
to Albuquerque, please.

49:32.474 --> 49:36.306
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

49:36.395 --> 49:39.349
- Oh, thank you.
- No parking.

49:39.440 --> 49:45.312
The white zone is for the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only. No parking.

49:46.989 --> 49:52.944
The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.

49:53.037 --> 49:54.745
No parking.

49:58.125 --> 50:02.538
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- Come on, over there, you jackass!

50:04.465 --> 50:06.588
Officer, those men are bad!

50:06.675 --> 50:09.083
Hold it right there!

50:10.929 --> 50:14.381
Hold it! Come back here!

50:19.563 --> 50:24.474
I swear to you, she'll be here any second.
Her ivy got caught in the luggage rack.

50:24.568 --> 50:26.360
Sandy, where are you?

50:26.445 --> 50:29.018
She's a sick woman. She's
gotta get on this plane.

50:29.114 --> 50:31.949
There's a kidney in Kansas City
that's not gettin' any fresher.

50:32.034 --> 50:36.945
Sandy! Excuse me. Look
out. Wait, Sandy. Sandy.

50:37.039 --> 50:39.660
- Here you go.
- Hold up there!

50:39.750 --> 50:42.704
- Anyone care for some money?
- Money! Money!

50:46.924 --> 50:50.209
What have you done? Oh, my God!

50:51.679 --> 50:54.680
- That's all our money. What are you doing?
- Hey! Hey!

50:58.686 --> 51:01.223
Albuquerque, honey, Albuquerque. Thanks.

51:07.278 --> 51:09.484
I gotta get on that plane!

51:47.276 --> 51:51.321
I sell cars in Albuquerque.
Give us a call if you can.

51:51.405 --> 51:54.856
- Wanna apprehend?
- No. We'll pick up surveillance.

51:56.827 --> 52:00.611
I had this old Cadillac, see? We couldn't
get rid of it. I said, what the hell...

52:00.706 --> 52:03.031
Oh, my God, there they are.

52:03.125 --> 52:06.292
- And I played it big. No use playing it little. I'm just sorry it was so...
- Look.

52:06.378 --> 52:09.048
Fan out.

52:09.131 --> 52:11.290
- Why don't you get your car the same colour as your...
- Come on.

52:11.383 --> 52:15.381
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, where
you gals scootin' off to, huh?

52:18.182 --> 52:20.851
- Panansky!
- Bobby, this way!

52:27.149 --> 52:28.940
Ow!

52:49.463 --> 52:52.499
Hey, buddy! Hey, where
do you think you're...

53:01.350 --> 53:03.758
Throw something.

53:10.150 --> 53:12.476
Go!

53:20.619 --> 53:23.490
And I thought coach was bad.

53:30.713 --> 53:34.248
Panansky! Panansky!

53:34.341 --> 53:37.212
Excuse me. Sir.

53:37.302 --> 53:41.252
- Has flight 501 arrived? - Yes,
ma'am. Right there. - Uh-huh. Yeah.

53:41.348 --> 53:43.341
Panansky!

53:49.940 --> 53:52.396
Where's he going?

53:52.484 --> 53:55.521
No, no, ladies. You
know better than this.

53:55.613 --> 53:59.480
- You're right. - That way. - You're
right, of course. Thanks for your help.

53:59.575 --> 54:02.492
Panansky! Where the hell have you been?

54:07.166 --> 54:10.416
- Michael! - Michael!
- There he goes!

54:10.502 --> 54:13.124
Wait! No, no, wait!

54:13.213 --> 54:16.298
Oh, no, no!

54:16.383 --> 54:18.921
Oh! Yes, okay.

54:27.770 --> 54:31.637
- Hey! Stop!
- Go through that next light! Go through the yellow! Through it!

54:55.506 --> 54:57.545
You can take the bike back.

54:57.633 --> 55:01.927
Michael and I will be spending
the night in that motel we passed.

55:02.012 --> 55:05.796
Dream on. We'll be on a plane to Hawaii.

55:12.022 --> 55:14.644
- I can't believe it.
- He's really in there.

55:14.733 --> 55:17.059
Yeah.

55:17.152 --> 55:19.394
What's the matter? You afraid?

55:19.488 --> 55:21.896
Why should I be?

55:24.451 --> 55:27.025
Then why don't you go rushing
into his... into his arms, huh?

55:27.121 --> 55:30.157
Well, why don't you?

55:30.249 --> 55:33.285
It's a long way to come to get bad news.

55:33.377 --> 55:35.369
Yeah.

55:35.462 --> 55:37.870
Well...

55:42.720 --> 55:45.127
- Oh, God!
- Oh, I know.

55:45.222 --> 55:47.678
- Let me see.
- Oh, no! Oh!

55:47.766 --> 55:50.304
- Rat woman! Oh!
- Oh, it's not that bad.

55:50.394 --> 55:52.351
- Oh, I'm...
- Oh, no!

55:52.438 --> 55:54.430
- Could we share the mirror?
- Oh, Christ!

55:54.523 --> 55:57.809
- What is it?
- I would be getting a zit.

55:57.902 --> 56:00.393
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.

56:00.488 --> 56:02.397
- No?
- No. You're worse than I am.

56:02.489 --> 56:05.324
- At least you have eyelashes. Geez.
- Oh, what do you want? You're a natural blonde.

56:05.409 --> 56:07.448
- And you tan. - I want
eyelashes. - You make me sick.

56:07.536 --> 56:10.537
Oh, natural? You think this is natural?

56:10.623 --> 56:12.781
"Oh, my dear, you too
can have this colour."

56:12.875 --> 56:16.374
- No shit? It looks great.
- Oh, thanks. It's just a rinse and a cellophane toner.

56:16.462 --> 56:20.045
- Yeah? - You want a Tic
Tac? - Yeah. - Okay. L...

56:27.514 --> 56:30.718
Well, I'd say good luck, but...

56:32.478 --> 56:35.099
Yeah.

56:35.189 --> 56:37.596
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

56:47.826 --> 56:51.030
Hello.

56:51.122 --> 56:54.288
Michael, no!

56:54.375 --> 56:57.329
You.

57:07.847 --> 57:10.053
- Oh, Michael!
- Michael!

57:13.269 --> 57:16.305
- He's all right.
- Oh! Let's get him out of here.

57:23.112 --> 57:25.781
- Michael? Oh!
- Michael. Oh!

57:25.864 --> 57:27.656
Oh!

57:27.741 --> 57:30.576
You're okay. It's just a bump.

57:30.661 --> 57:33.199
- Yeah.
- My God.

57:34.456 --> 57:37.161
- Michael! - Michael! - I feel that
we are entitled to an explanation here.

57:37.251 --> 57:39.409
- What is your relationship with this woman?
- Did you make it with her?

57:39.503 --> 57:42.290
Do you even know this person?

57:42.381 --> 57:44.836
- That's why you're
here? - Yeah! - Well...

57:44.925 --> 57:47.463
I know you're in some sort of trouble,
but I'd like to discuss this first.

57:47.553 --> 57:49.711
- Please.
- Right now.

57:49.805 --> 57:52.296
- W-Wait a minute. -
Please? - Oh, Michael. Here.

57:52.391 --> 57:56.852
- Darling, let me help you up.
- Oh! Easy.

57:56.937 --> 57:59.606
- You mean you did this on
your own? - Yeah. - Yeah.

58:01.275 --> 58:03.563
- There's nobody with you?
- No.

58:03.652 --> 58:06.226
- He changed the subject. Did you see how he did that?
- Yes, you did.

58:06.322 --> 58:10.699
Now, look here, Michael, there's an issue at stake
and I'm sorry, you're just not going to get out of it.

58:10.784 --> 58:15.826
- How did you follow me here? - L-l... Well,
we... we knew you weren't dead at the morgue.

58:15.914 --> 58:18.240
- And you told them?
- Of course we told them. We...

58:18.333 --> 58:20.706
- Shit.
- Bad idea, huh?

58:20.794 --> 58:24.044
Wait a minute. You mean
you wanted to be dead?

58:24.131 --> 58:27.215
It would have been useful.

58:30.638 --> 58:34.421
Russell, abort the rendezvous. There's a
chopper out there, and this could be trouble.

58:34.516 --> 58:37.601
- Get out of here. I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
- Screw 'em. You got the stuff.

58:37.686 --> 58:41.518
No, we don't have the advantage here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas. Acknowledge.

58:41.607 --> 58:44.773
You're the boss. Over and out. Let's go.

58:50.741 --> 58:52.947
You're not a schoolteacher,
are you, Michael?

58:53.035 --> 58:56.202
Michael, what's going
on? What's in Tres Crucas?

58:57.498 --> 58:59.953
- I'm sorry you heard that.
- Who cares what I heard?

59:00.042 --> 59:02.367
What was I to you?

59:02.461 --> 59:04.999
- What was I?
- Convenient.

59:07.341 --> 59:10.627
Moderately enjoyable...

59:10.719 --> 59:12.878
largely forgettable...

59:12.972 --> 59:15.723
and a lesson to me not
to leave loose ends.

59:38.914 --> 59:42.117
I can't go on. I don't wanna go on.

59:42.209 --> 59:47.370
Oh, Mother told me about men like
this. I hate it when she's right.

59:47.464 --> 59:50.252
Oh, loose ends!

59:50.342 --> 59:53.379
That's all I was to him? A loose end?

59:53.470 --> 59:57.800
What are you doing worrying about your
love life going to shit? We're gonna die!

59:57.891 --> 01:00:00.217
That's comforting.

01:00:06.025 --> 01:00:10.271
- Who the hell are they?
- Well, how am I supposed to know? He's after Michael.

01:00:12.406 --> 01:00:14.648
They're the good guys!

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.030
- Help us! Take us!
- Down here! Here! Please! Help us!

01:00:19.121 --> 01:00:21.529
Down here!

01:00:21.624 --> 01:00:26.499
Get into the light! He won't
go for us if we're in the light!

01:00:26.587 --> 01:00:29.125
- But it won't hold still!
- It's moving too fast!

01:00:29.214 --> 01:00:31.788
Sandy! Oh!

01:00:33.927 --> 01:00:35.588
Come on, Sandy!

01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:48.982
Hurry!

01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:51.190
Oh, how do they ever catch criminals?

01:00:55.866 --> 01:00:59.698
- He's going to cut us off!
- I'll get you. I'll get you!

01:01:15.135 --> 01:01:17.970
Come on!

01:01:18.055 --> 01:01:22.218
Looks like these ends are gonna stay loose
just a little longer, you big shithead!

01:01:25.687 --> 01:01:28.261
Come on! Down here!

01:01:40.369 --> 01:01:43.370
- Hello!
- Weldon?

01:01:43.455 --> 01:01:47.702
Hello! I guess you know Mr Atkins!

01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:50.829
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's all right!

01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:55.503
We're CIA!

01:01:55.593 --> 01:01:57.715
CIA?

01:01:57.803 --> 01:02:00.555
Uh, can I offer you ladies
coffee, or, um, a Coke?

01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:03.889
- Weldon!
- Weldon! What is going on?

01:02:06.145 --> 01:02:08.896
I'm not authorized to debrief you at...

01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:11.519
You're not authorized to debrief me?

01:02:11.608 --> 01:02:15.274
After I saved you from
being throttled? Weldon!

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:21.655
Who is Michael Santers?

01:02:24.663 --> 01:02:27.119
He was one of our best.

01:02:27.207 --> 01:02:29.781
Very high clearance.
Access to everything.

01:02:29.877 --> 01:02:32.498
And then...

01:02:32.588 --> 01:02:36.004
we began to suspect that he was a
double agent working for Korzenowski.

01:02:37.384 --> 01:02:41.085
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Korzenowski, our teacher?

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.308
Our teacher and, I'm sorry to tell you,
a key undercover man for the Russians.

01:02:45.392 --> 01:02:50.054
Oh, please! The man has a reputation.
He was the definitive Lear.

01:02:50.147 --> 01:02:53.516
He is the definitive KGB.
That's why I was in that class.

01:02:53.609 --> 01:02:57.986
I was supposed to keep an eye on him,
see if he and Santers were in contact.

01:02:58.072 --> 01:03:00.527
- And they were?
- We still don't know how.

01:03:00.616 --> 01:03:03.285
I never saw them come
within a mile of each other.

01:03:03.369 --> 01:03:06.535
But somehow Korzenowski hired him.

01:03:06.622 --> 01:03:08.947
What did Michael do?

01:03:10.292 --> 01:03:13.542
He stole the prototype
of an experimental virus.

01:03:13.629 --> 01:03:19.169
It's called floratoxin. It's,
uh, an airborne defoliant.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.049
A few drops destroys all vegetation for
hundreds and hundreds of square miles.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.889
Like grass and trees a-and
the... and the whole shot?

01:03:28.978 --> 01:03:31.515
- As in California.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:31.605 --> 01:03:35.899
- As in the entire wheat belt.
- He would do that?

01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:40.646
All he has to do is spill a couple
of drops, and the wind'll do the rest.

01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:45.734
Don't try to bargain with
me. I want $20 million cash.

01:03:45.828 --> 01:03:49.078
And please don't insult my
intelligence by trying to mark it.

01:03:49.164 --> 01:03:53.873
All right. Only it's going to take
a couple of hours. Where are you?

01:03:56.338 --> 01:03:58.960
Don't be ridiculous, Weldon.
They're his accomplices.

01:03:59.049 --> 01:04:01.338
- Oh, please! - They're
professionals. - Oh, no, sir!

01:04:01.427 --> 01:04:03.218
- I believe them.
- What?

01:04:03.304 --> 01:04:05.380
- You believe that a couple of
two-bit actresses... - Oh, l...

01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:07.430
- Where are they taking me? - Could
have tracked down Michael Santers? - Yes.

01:04:07.516 --> 01:04:10.268
It was a rendezvous. They helped him
to escape. I was there. You remember?

01:04:10.352 --> 01:04:13.638
Yeah, what did we know? He was just
some guy we happened to be boffing.

01:04:13.731 --> 01:04:17.680
Damn it, I don't boff.
I have never boffed.

01:04:17.776 --> 01:04:21.856
Okay, had sex with. Is
that white enough for you?

01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:24.984
- Move it.
- Sir, if you'll just go over their statements...

01:04:25.075 --> 01:04:30.699
That's what I intend to do at Fort Morgan in a nice
underground cell until we get Santers' whereabouts.

01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:35.535
You want to know his whereabouts? Fine. He
said he was going to Tres Crucas, New Mexico.

01:04:35.628 --> 01:04:38.881
That's a little bit too easy,
isn't it? Get in the van!

01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:39.462
That's a little bit too easy,
isn't it? Get in the van!

01:04:39.548 --> 01:04:44.044
Okay, okay, here's an idea. Why don't we all
go to Tres Crucas and see if Michael is there?

01:04:44.136 --> 01:04:47.007
I'll prove it to you.

01:04:47.097 --> 01:04:50.466
I kn... I know, I know. Your head hurts,
and it's our fault. I understand that.

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:52.468
- But if you'd only identified yourself...
- Oh, I see.

01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:56.689
- You want me to walk up to enemy operatives and hand
over... - Oh, come on! - Ah, who's an enemy operative?

01:04:56.774 --> 01:04:59.894
- Hey, Steve, why the hell are we slowing down?
- Wait just a...

01:05:03.531 --> 01:05:06.104
Who the hell are you?

01:05:10.329 --> 01:05:12.286
Oh, my God!

01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:25.791
Some of us who teach can also do.

01:05:27.763 --> 01:05:29.756
What do you want?

01:05:29.848 --> 01:05:33.218
- Where is Michael Santers?
- Hey, you should know.

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.635
You're the ones he's working for.

01:05:46.865 --> 01:05:50.484
This is last time I will ask you.

01:05:50.577 --> 01:05:52.985
Where is Michael Santers?

01:06:08.554 --> 01:06:11.887
Come on, come on, come on! Go. Go!

01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:16.593
I think you'll stay.

01:06:52.806 --> 01:06:55.262
I never died better, did I, teach?

01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:58.435
Okay, let's go up, real easy.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.475
That a boy. That a boy.

01:07:01.565 --> 01:07:04.353
Yeah, you're a good
actor, but a lousy shot.

01:07:04.443 --> 01:07:06.981
Please, look, we can make bargain.

01:07:07.071 --> 01:07:11.483
- Uh, the KGB is very generous.
- Oh... Oh, stop with the KGB.

01:07:11.575 --> 01:07:14.113
How dare you defraud the entire
New York theatre community?

01:07:14.203 --> 01:07:15.662
- Lauren. - I've
never... Hi. - Lauren.

01:07:15.746 --> 01:07:17.904
- I've never heard such behaviour in my
life. - Lauren. - These people are artists.

01:07:17.998 --> 01:07:21.332
- Lauren. - What is it? -
Th-That's not the hot issue here.

01:07:21.418 --> 01:07:23.791
The... No. No.

01:07:23.879 --> 01:07:26.085
Okay. Okay, here it comes, Stan.

01:07:26.173 --> 01:07:29.459
You're gonna tell us right now
what was going on in that class...

01:07:29.552 --> 01:07:33.134
or Sandy's gonna shoot you.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.048
I'll shoot it off, Stan.

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:41.142
We needed couriers.

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:44.100
- How? -
Yeah. - Uh...

01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:46.267
your notebooks.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:52.529
I left microdot for him in yours,
and he sent back reply in yours.

01:07:52.616 --> 01:07:56.696
Well, if he stole the toxin
for you, why don't you have it?

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:04.375
He screwed you too.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:06.620
He screwed me too.

01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:14.219
Ladies, I admit I've made a big mistake,
but if you'd just put yourself in my hands...

01:08:14.305 --> 01:08:17.259
you can walk away from here right
now with full federal protection.

01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:20.765
Complete clearance of
all conspiracy charges.

01:08:20.853 --> 01:08:25.810
I will give you free acting
lessons for the rest of your life.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:29.269
- We'll pay all the expenses you've incurred.
- Oh, stop it.

01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:32.859
The both of you, you're so
full of it. Come on, let's go.

01:08:32.948 --> 01:08:35.356
It stinks around here.

01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:37.858
Thanks for trying.

01:08:40.622 --> 01:08:44.287
- We'll find you.
- Not if the coyotes find you first!

01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:55.337
- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
- Please!

01:08:55.429 --> 01:08:57.801
Please!

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:03.015
Blood is on your head, you putz.

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:06.354
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yeah.

01:09:08.108 --> 01:09:10.813
- We're a couple of chumps. You know that, don't you?
- Oh, we're worse than that.

01:09:10.903 --> 01:09:14.188
- Mmm, well, okay, yeah.
- I can't believe I didn't see it.

01:09:14.281 --> 01:09:17.033
- I am so humiliated.
- I know.

01:09:17.117 --> 01:09:19.654
He hit on us for those notebooks.

01:09:19.745 --> 01:09:22.912
"Hit on"? He got me to pick him up.

01:09:22.997 --> 01:09:27.210
Tell me! I attacked
him in a Burger King.

01:09:29.254 --> 01:09:33.334
I worked all night on his
fucking pumpkin costume.

01:09:33.425 --> 01:09:35.714
- For a mythical student, if you will.
- No!

01:09:35.803 --> 01:09:37.760
- Yes!
- No.

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:41.096
Hey, I baked cookies
for his entire class.

01:09:41.183 --> 01:09:44.054
- Oh, no!
- Could you see me baking?

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:47.845
Icing... Icing these little
happy faces on every one of'em?

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:51.356
Well, I paid $5,000
to study with the KGB.

01:09:51.443 --> 01:09:54.480
The KGB. Oh, my God!

01:09:54.571 --> 01:09:56.979
Oh, he trashed me much
worse than he trashed you.

01:09:57.074 --> 01:10:00.739
- Oh!
- Really. Hamlet. How am I gonna know Hamlet?

01:10:03.747 --> 01:10:07.413
You really should if you're
going to be an actress.

01:10:13.382 --> 01:10:15.458
Oh, pardon me...

01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:20.462
but, you know, we can't all of us study at the
London School of Shakespearean Weirdness, you know.

01:10:20.556 --> 01:10:23.592
Some of us had to schlepp
drinks for a living.

01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:29.602
I'm sorry, Sandy.

01:10:31.942 --> 01:10:34.350
Oh, God.

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:39.614
So, where you wanna go now?

01:10:41.327 --> 01:10:43.699
I don't know.

01:10:43.787 --> 01:10:46.907
They'll be after us.

01:10:46.999 --> 01:10:50.333
- I was thinking...
- Yeah. So was I.

01:10:50.419 --> 01:10:52.412
What?

01:10:52.504 --> 01:10:55.754
That we go find Michael
and rip his face off.

01:10:55.841 --> 01:10:59.625
- That, and get the toxin back.
- Oh, the hell with the toxin.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.923
- I just wanna rip his face off.
- No, we need the toxin.

01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:07.807
We don't want the CIA on
our backs all our lives.

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:13.518
- Just so I get to rip his face off.
- I promise we'll rip his face off after we get the toxin.

01:11:13.609 --> 01:11:17.108
Hey! Hello, honey! Hello!

01:11:17.196 --> 01:11:19.604
No, no, you idiot!

01:11:21.534 --> 01:11:23.740
My shoes!

01:11:29.124 --> 01:11:31.746
- Hey, Stan.
- What?

01:11:31.835 --> 01:11:36.414
Looks like you're gonna
be facing KGB tribunals.

01:11:36.507 --> 01:11:40.587
Unless, of course, you'd
like to make an arrangement.

01:11:40.678 --> 01:11:43.844
Would such an arrangement include, uh,

01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:46.338
unlimited expense account?

01:11:47.935 --> 01:11:50.342
Condo on the Potomac?

01:11:52.147 --> 01:11:55.184
Redskins season tickets? Huh?

01:12:14.169 --> 01:12:16.162
Aw, nuts!

01:12:16.255 --> 01:12:18.710
Thanks, Humphrey. It was sweet of you.

01:12:18.799 --> 01:12:21.207
Oh, it was my pleasure, Lauren.

01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:28.641
Well, what should we do first?
Get a little sushi? Take in a show?

01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:43.489
Now, why do they do that?

01:12:43.574 --> 01:12:47.073
Has there ever been one woman in the
history of the world who actually said...

01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:49.617
"Yes, fellas, please, take me now."

01:12:49.705 --> 01:12:52.825
For a bed and a bath,
I'd... I'd consider it.

01:12:52.916 --> 01:12:57.080
- Bite your tongue.
- Hey, turisto. Welcome.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:02.509
Hey, you're lookin' for a guide, right?

01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:08.049
Native Indian to show you the hidden
wonders of this great Chicatacawa nation?

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.761
Well, ladies, you have found him.

01:13:10.851 --> 01:13:16.308
Special price, today only... $20.

01:13:16.398 --> 01:13:20.645
I don't want to be the first to break
this to you... you are not an Indian.

01:13:20.736 --> 01:13:22.693
That's a technicality.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.074
I've been a blood brother to
the Chicatacawa since 1968.

01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:30.943
I got a tan. What do you want for $20?

01:13:32.498 --> 01:13:38.417
Honey, I'm an actress. I love to dress
up and pretend. And the hat is fabulous.

01:13:38.504 --> 01:13:42.039
But what we need right
now is to find a man.

01:13:42.132 --> 01:13:45.833
Well, okay, but it's
not gonna be that great.

01:13:45.928 --> 01:13:48.383
- I'm a little bombed.
- What?

01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:51.757
And it's still $20.

01:13:51.851 --> 01:13:54.341
No. No, no. No, no, no.

01:13:54.437 --> 01:13:58.055
- We're looking for a specific man...
- So we can kill him.

01:13:58.148 --> 01:14:02.775
Oh, then you need a witness. Hey,
I'll stand up for you in court.

01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:06.776
I saw the whole thing. It was an
accident. The axe slipped out of your hand.

01:14:06.866 --> 01:14:09.783
It's a wonderful scenario. When we
find the guy, we're gonna let you know.

01:14:09.869 --> 01:14:12.655
- Thanks.
- Find him?

01:14:12.746 --> 01:14:16.032
Find as in "locate"? "Track down"?

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:20.123
Hey, now we are rollin'. We have
hit the nail right on the hammer.

01:14:20.212 --> 01:14:23.961
I'm a tracker. That's
my vocation... a tracker.

01:14:24.049 --> 01:14:28.378
A guy who tracks down other
guys. That's my main gig!

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:31.922
Genuine Indian shit.

01:14:32.015 --> 01:14:33.593
- What do you think?
- He's a bum.

01:14:33.684 --> 01:14:36.519
But he might have good instincts.
Should we ask for references?

01:14:36.604 --> 01:14:39.521
Hey, you wanna find this guy or not?

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:48.188
- Ah, ancient Indian techniques.
- Oh, those could be anybody's.

01:14:48.282 --> 01:14:54.450
Yeah, they could...
anybody about 185 pounds...

01:14:54.622 --> 01:14:57.955
dragging his right leg a
little like it's injured.

01:14:58.042 --> 01:15:00.747
And...

01:15:02.504 --> 01:15:05.458
smoking one hand-rolled Colton's...

01:15:05.549 --> 01:15:08.087
every three minutes.

01:15:09.303 --> 01:15:13.764
Admit it. The man is cool.

01:15:13.849 --> 01:15:16.387
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, baby.

01:15:16.477 --> 01:15:18.932
Yeah, why you do this to me, huh?

01:15:25.736 --> 01:15:29.401
Oh, my God.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:33.784
Wow! That is some major
ill repute happening there.

01:15:33.869 --> 01:15:36.075
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, don't try it.

01:15:36.163 --> 01:15:40.375
You'll never get past
Gert. It's customers only.

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:43.709
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on. Hey.

01:15:43.796 --> 01:15:47.924
- Let's go, will ya. Come on.
- Customers?

01:15:48.008 --> 01:15:50.843
Customers! You get his
shirt, I'll get his pants.

01:15:50.928 --> 01:15:55.471
What? Come on! You had your chance
at me, and you lost it. Come on, now!

01:15:55.557 --> 01:15:58.393
- Oh, I want the hat.
- Will you stop it!

01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:06.974
Who do you think you're kiddin', huh?

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.487
How old are you boys?
Thirteen? Fourteen?

01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:16.902
Hell, you're just babies.

01:16:16.996 --> 01:16:20.364
Why, you can't even shave yet.

01:16:20.457 --> 01:16:24.834
- Your daddy know you're here?
- Hell, yes. He told us where to come.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.458
Come. Get it?

01:16:27.548 --> 01:16:31.213
Oh. First time.

01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:33.840
Oh, no way!

01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:37.298
- It's his first time.
- What'd you tell her that fer?

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:39.467
- You chickenshit, huh?
- I ain't! I done it plenty!

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.098
- You chickenshit. You chickenshit.
- Oh, you always tell my secrets. I'm gonna get you.

01:16:42.187 --> 01:16:46.351
Chickenshit... Oh, lordy, don't do that.
That ain't no way to act in a whorehouse.

01:16:46.442 --> 01:16:48.849
Be a man. Be a man!

01:16:52.198 --> 01:16:56.361
This is Tina and Maria. Have fun.

01:17:00.414 --> 01:17:03.451
Yeah, now tell me how
we're gonna get it up.

01:17:21.227 --> 01:17:24.062
Definitely not.

01:17:25.397 --> 01:17:28.185
Oh, God.

01:17:28.275 --> 01:17:31.940
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:17:32.029 --> 01:17:34.437
- He's there.
- "Oh, God, oh, God."

01:17:34.531 --> 01:17:37.568
- Won't be long now.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:17:37.659 --> 01:17:40.696
Oh, God. Oh, God!

01:17:40.788 --> 01:17:44.322
Oh... Oh, God!

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:47.038
- That was it.
- He'll be asleep in three seconds.

01:17:47.127 --> 01:17:50.579
Did you ever think you'd be
glad men roll over and pass out?

01:18:06.355 --> 01:18:08.762
- Okay?
- You've gotta be...

01:18:11.986 --> 01:18:14.393
Have a nice day.

01:18:16.031 --> 01:18:18.522
- I've come to a definite conclusion.
- What's that?

01:18:18.617 --> 01:18:21.025
You can have him.

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:25.323
Oh, God.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.487
Was it good for you too?

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.567
H-H-Hurry!

01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:10.078
Hey, baby!

01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:32.811
Help me up!

01:19:37.029 --> 01:19:41.774
You guys are the sweetest,
most gorgeous creatures.

01:19:41.867 --> 01:19:43.907
You're sweet.

01:19:43.994 --> 01:19:46.402
Yikes!

01:20:14.316 --> 01:20:17.566
- Hey, wait a minute. Guys!
- Wait a minute. We're not supposed to stop.

01:20:17.653 --> 01:20:20.274
Why... Why are we
stopping? Why did we stop?

01:20:20.364 --> 01:20:22.190
- Oh. Sorry. - Uh, w-we
have to get to a phone.

01:20:22.283 --> 01:20:25.118
- Yeah, uh, uh, phone. - We have to...
Oh, God. - Phone. Phone. - Oh, my God.

01:20:25.202 --> 01:20:28.653
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get back to the reservation...

01:20:28.747 --> 01:20:32.163
before one of these guys hits
on me for my phone number.

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:37.328
- Oh, come on, you don't look so bad.
- Except for prints don't work for him. He should stick with solids.

01:20:37.423 --> 01:20:41.290
- Wait a minute. Did he say phone?
- Phone!

01:20:41.385 --> 01:20:44.718
- Frank! - Leave me alone!
- Frank, you have to listen!

01:20:44.805 --> 01:20:47.047
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!

01:20:47.141 --> 01:20:50.640
- Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh.

01:20:50.728 --> 01:20:54.144
- I'm sorry, Frank, but this is really important.
- Oh, leave me alone.

01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:57.019
- Just leave me alone!
- Look, we gotta use your phone.

01:20:57.109 --> 01:20:59.944
Forget it! You stiffed me for $20.

01:21:00.028 --> 01:21:04.490
You leave me in drag. You got some
maniac with a knife chasing you.

01:21:04.575 --> 01:21:08.620
These things do not tempt me
to wanna team up with you guys.

01:21:09.955 --> 01:21:12.992
- Ah, what's wrong with my head?
- Are you okay?

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:16.203
No! I think I'm gettin' sober!

01:21:16.295 --> 01:21:20.162
Look, listen, Frank, we're
not just jerking you around.

01:21:20.257 --> 01:21:22.463
Some guys are chasing us 'cause
one of them stole a virus...

01:21:22.551 --> 01:21:26.845
that's gonna kill and destroy all the plants and all
the trees for thousands of miles all the way around.

01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:30.097
We stole it back, so now they're
trying to kill us. You get it?

01:21:30.184 --> 01:21:33.884
Jesus, the '60s were
good to you, weren't they?

01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:37.099
Frank, that's right.
Think back to the '60s.

01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:40.809
- People did things for each other.
- They were wasted.

01:21:40.903 --> 01:21:44.022
Listen, Frankie, get us
to a telephone, all right?

01:21:44.115 --> 01:21:47.483
I swear to you, you're
gonna be showered with money.

01:21:47.576 --> 01:21:49.901
Showered with money.

01:21:53.958 --> 01:21:56.994
Okay, ladies, this is it.

01:21:57.086 --> 01:22:01.546
This is it, Frank? It's not exactly
the hub of the reservation, is it?

01:22:01.632 --> 01:22:05.001
- Hey, it's off season. What do you want?
- We wanna use the phone, Frank.

01:22:05.093 --> 01:22:07.798
Hey, five minutes. That's it.

01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:11.802
If you guys stay more than five minutes,
you'll bring down a goddam tornado.

01:22:11.892 --> 01:22:14.134
We have no intention of hanging around.

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:16.850
- Fine.
- I just wanna make this call... I must have that blouse!

01:22:16.939 --> 01:22:21.767
- That shirt has my name on it.
- Oh! Oh, I love this.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.696
- I wore one of these when I did Oklahoma.
- Oh, that'll be cute on you.

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.363
- You think? Not too short-waisted? - No! You get
a little snakeskin belt, give it a little texture.

01:22:28.451 --> 01:22:31.404
- Oh, that's a good idea. I like this too.
- Hey!

01:22:31.495 --> 01:22:34.330
Will ya? Come on, now. Just take the
blouse. Keep 'em. They're on the house.

01:22:34.415 --> 01:22:37.749
- Now, you gotta make this phone call. - Oh, thanks,
Frank. - Get on the phone, and let's get going here.

01:22:37.835 --> 01:22:42.046
Right. Right, right, right. Okay, who are
we gonna call? The New York Times. Huh?

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:46.378
- No. We'll call the president.
- Oh, yeah! That's really a call he's gonna take.

01:22:46.468 --> 01:22:50.087
"Hi, we're two struggling actresses.
We're saving the world." Get real.

01:22:50.181 --> 01:22:53.431
He was an actor.

01:22:53.517 --> 01:22:55.426
Okay, the FBI.

01:22:56.979 --> 01:23:01.143
We're gonna call the FBI, we're gonna
turn this in, we're gonna save our country.

01:23:01.233 --> 01:23:03.475
Uh-huh. Do you have a changing room?

01:23:05.488 --> 01:23:08.488
This doesn't work.

01:23:12.119 --> 01:23:15.156
They must have cut me off.

01:23:15.247 --> 01:23:18.367
- I owe 'em a little money.
- Don't you know how to deal with those dorks?

01:23:18.459 --> 01:23:21.459
- You don't have to pay them anything.
- You don't?

01:23:21.545 --> 01:23:23.917
- No, all you have
to do... - No! - What?

01:23:24.006 --> 01:23:26.212
No, not that again.

01:23:30.554 --> 01:23:33.974
Frank, how do we get
to a phone that works?

01:23:33.974 --> 01:23:34.472
Frank, how do we get
to a phone that works?

01:23:34.558 --> 01:23:38.176
Okay, ladies, this here's Frodo.
He'll take real good care of ya.

01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:41.888
Now, you're gonna ride across those hills
till you come to the edge of a cliff.

01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:44.520
Don't go off there.
That's a 700-foot drop.

01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:50.280
Now, if you do get down, you're gonna come to the
rattlesnake area. Be real careful goin' through there.

01:23:50.366 --> 01:23:53.569
Now, take a left at the rattlesnakes
and you'll come around to a dirt road.

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:57.243
Take you right into the taco stand.
They got a phone in there. Huh?

01:23:57.331 --> 01:24:00.201
It couldn't be just a block and
a half to the corner store, Frank?

01:24:00.292 --> 01:24:02.665
Not around here.

01:24:02.753 --> 01:24:05.956
- Hey, Frank, thanks.
- Oh, okay, all right.

01:24:06.048 --> 01:24:07.875
- Now, come on, we gotta... - We
won't forget you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:07.967 --> 01:24:10.375
- We're gonna see you get something out of this, Frank.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:24:10.469 --> 01:24:13.802
I'll be showered with money. I can hardly
wait. Come on, let's get outta here.

01:24:13.889 --> 01:24:16.131
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. I don't have the toxin.

01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:19.428
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, hold on a second there.

01:24:24.858 --> 01:24:27.266
Give me the vial.

01:24:27.361 --> 01:24:30.030
Slowly.

01:24:33.283 --> 01:24:35.988
- Let go of me!
- Go!

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:45.828
Whoa! Asshole! Come on!

01:24:45.921 --> 01:24:48.329
Well, of course.

01:24:50.175 --> 01:24:53.260
Russell! Boyd!

01:24:53.345 --> 01:24:54.756
- Where's the other one?
- She got away.

01:24:54.847 --> 01:24:57.420
- Now you're gonna make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to drive a stick shift.

01:24:57.516 --> 01:25:00.351
- Get in the back.
- Oh.

01:25:12.615 --> 01:25:17.691
Let's turn around, okay?
Let's just go this way.

01:25:21.499 --> 01:25:23.372
Holy shit.

01:25:29.548 --> 01:25:33.131
Go away!

01:25:33.218 --> 01:25:35.923
- Frank?
- Go away!

01:25:36.013 --> 01:25:38.883
- What happened? Where's Lauren?
- They took her.

01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:41.382
- We gotta go find her.
- Oh, no!

01:25:41.477 --> 01:25:44.763
Frank, I can't track her without
you. Now, please, come on!

01:25:44.855 --> 01:25:48.271
- You go! I'm busy bleeding!
- Frank!

01:25:48.358 --> 01:25:53.316
You don't give up, do ya? You think I'm gonna go
chasing a pack of psychos for some dumb blonde?

01:25:53.406 --> 01:25:56.110
She's not dumb, and she's not a blonde.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.450
- Well, good luck, lady.
- Frank!

01:25:59.537 --> 01:26:01.328
Frank!

01:26:06.752 --> 01:26:11.129
Okay, okay, the truth.

01:26:11.214 --> 01:26:15.793
Lauren and I pulled a bank job. Those guys
were feds, and Lauren buried the money...

01:26:15.886 --> 01:26:19.718
- Spare me, will ya?
- Well, what about revenge?

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:22.761
I mean, these guys trashed your
house. Don't you want to get even?

01:26:22.852 --> 01:26:26.552
I'm insured. No deductible.
Save your breath.

01:26:28.315 --> 01:26:33.061
I'm running out of bullshit,
Frank. They're gonna kill her.

01:26:33.153 --> 01:26:35.360
I know it's not your problem...

01:26:35.447 --> 01:26:39.397
but this person and I, we've been through
a lot of disgusting things together.

01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:41.901
This person and I are...

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:48.206
This person's a friend...

01:26:48.293 --> 01:26:52.208
and I don't have that many friends.

01:26:57.219 --> 01:26:58.429
I do.

01:26:58.429 --> 01:26:59.627
I do.

01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:15.687
Hello, Michael. This is Atkins.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.531
Hello, Joe. Do you have the money?

01:27:18.615 --> 01:27:21.153
Yep, it's here.

01:27:21.243 --> 01:27:23.532
Fine. Here it is.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:30.205
You'll get into the chopper and fly to
Mesa Azul Cliffs at the Four Fingers.

01:27:30.294 --> 01:27:34.042
Don't even think about ground
support because I've got lookouts.

01:27:34.131 --> 01:27:39.754
Now, if I see a plane, a tank, a
chopper other than your chopper...

01:27:39.845 --> 01:27:44.257
I'll get very nervous and I'm gonna dump this
stuff in the first stiff wind blowing east.

01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:47.220
You got it?

01:27:47.311 --> 01:27:50.062
You will not land the chopper.

01:27:50.147 --> 01:27:54.311
You'll come level with the mesa and
you'll lower the money down to me...

01:27:54.401 --> 01:27:56.975
at 5.:00 p.m. Exactly.

01:28:11.418 --> 01:28:14.206
And now you're gonna make the exchange.

01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:17.463
I knew you wouldn't keep
your end of the bargain.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.502
This is your big moment.
Don't you wanna do it yourself?

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:27.932
Atkins is a crack shot.

01:28:28.018 --> 01:28:30.972
Like I said, I'm doing the exchange.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.683
- I see somebody. It's Lauren.
- Now you wanna tell me how much you believe them?

01:28:38.779 --> 01:28:43.026
No, don't shoot. Sir,
she's being coerced.

01:29:31.624 --> 01:29:34.494
- Will you land this damn thing!
- He's trying!

01:29:51.143 --> 01:29:54.559
Throw down the bag.

01:29:54.646 --> 01:29:57.980
- Throw it down.
- You'll shoot me.

01:29:58.066 --> 01:30:00.308
I'm really sorry about this.

01:30:21.173 --> 01:30:23.296
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:30:24.885 --> 01:30:28.752
- Aren't you dead yet?
- Not till I play Hamlet.

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:36.762
- Boy!
- Oh, you came back.

01:30:36.855 --> 01:30:39.643
- Sure!
- I can't believe it.

01:30:39.733 --> 01:30:42.188
- And look at you. You made off with the works.
- Yes.

01:30:42.277 --> 01:30:46.939
- I got the toxin and $20 million.
- Wow!

01:30:47.032 --> 01:30:49.606
This time l... l-I think
I'll hold the money.

01:30:49.702 --> 01:30:52.821
- You don't mind.
- Oh, look, there's Weldon.

01:30:52.913 --> 01:30:55.535
Maybe we can hitch a ride
with those guys. Hey, handsome!

01:30:58.752 --> 01:31:01.956
- Go! Go!
- Go where?

01:31:20.899 --> 01:31:23.900
I will never...

01:31:23.986 --> 01:31:27.520
date a man again.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:39.333
- Sandy.
- Getting laid just isn't worth it.

01:31:39.418 --> 01:31:41.790
Oh, Sandy!

01:31:43.797 --> 01:31:47.213
Get it! Get it!

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.179
Pull!

01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:59.227
Pull! Oh!

01:32:00.522 --> 01:32:02.930
There is no God.

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:11.114
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!

01:32:49.154 --> 01:32:51.562
Yes. Let's go.

01:32:53.909 --> 01:32:56.400
- Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.

01:33:08.174 --> 01:33:11.376
You son of a bitch! En garde!

01:33:12.427 --> 01:33:14.716
- Yes!
- Go!

01:33:35.326 --> 01:33:38.825
- Where is it? Shit.
- I don't have it!

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:42.496
I have it. Let her go.

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:44.908
No! You...

01:33:48.797 --> 01:33:51.205
Shit.

01:33:55.971 --> 01:33:57.762
Ah, nuts.

01:34:49.983 --> 01:34:52.190
Oh, shit!

01:35:23.392 --> 01:35:26.346
Nine years of ballet, asshole!

01:35:29.731 --> 01:35:31.771
You did it! You did it!

01:35:39.408 --> 01:35:42.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:36:07.645 --> 01:36:10.432
That is the best Hamlet ever.

01:36:12.107 --> 01:36:14.598
Except for mine.

01:36:17.613 --> 01:36:20.981
Wow! Yeah!

01:36:36.215 --> 01:36:39.797
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.

01:36:39.885 --> 01:36:43.052
- They bought that shit.
- Sh... "Shit"?

01:36:43.138 --> 01:36:46.139
You're calling my Hamlet shit?

01:36:46.225 --> 01:36:49.060
He's a wimp. I mean, look at him. He
can't make up his mind about anything.

01:36:49.145 --> 01:36:52.596
He stands around all night and says,
"What'll I do? What'll I do? What'll I do?"

01:36:52.689 --> 01:36:56.557
Give me Romeo or Henry the Fifth.
Now, there's a guy I could boff.

01:36:56.652 --> 01:36:59.439
Boff? Oh, we're back to boffing, are we?

01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:03.776
- I see. That's... That's the criteria for your great...
- Absolutely!

01:37:03.868 --> 01:37:05.990
Right, whether you would boff the hero.

01:37:06.078 --> 01:37:10.290
Well, who will you go to

01:37:10.374 --> 01:37:14.538
When there's no one to betray

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:16.288
And I said

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.669
Who will you go to

01:37:18.757 --> 01:37:22.376
When your best friend turns away

01:37:22.469 --> 01:37:24.177
Hey, hey

01:37:24.263 --> 01:37:26.089
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:37:26.182 --> 01:37:29.266
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:37:29.352 --> 01:37:32.387
It's the last time

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.472
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:37:34.565 --> 01:37:37.601
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:37:37.693 --> 01:37:40.777
It's the last time, baby

01:37:40.863 --> 01:37:42.902
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:46.026
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:37:46.118 --> 01:37:49.202
It's the last time

01:37:49.288 --> 01:37:51.197
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:54.375
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:37:54.459 --> 01:37:56.702
It's the last time, baby

01:37:56.795 --> 01:38:00.709
There's a garden full of roses

01:38:00.799 --> 01:38:04.963
There's a necklace full of pearls

01:38:05.054 --> 01:38:09.597
You have come to take the roses

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:13.348
To give to other girls

01:38:13.437 --> 01:38:18.016
Well, I'm just a pretty thing

01:38:18.108 --> 01:38:21.691
You wanted for a day

01:38:21.779 --> 01:38:25.907
There is nothing left between us

01:38:25.991 --> 01:38:29.443
There is nothing left to say

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:31.245
Hey, hey

01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:33.287
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:36.410
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:38:39.588 --> 01:38:41.628
Last time you're gonna let me down

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:44.882
Last time you're gonna
fool around with me

01:38:53.269 --> 01:38:56.388
It's the last time

01:38:57.305 --> 01:39:03.641
