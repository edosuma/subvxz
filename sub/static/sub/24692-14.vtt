NARRATOR: In New York City's
war on crime,

00:08.908 --> 00:11.047
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued

00:11.111 --> 00:13.818
by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.416
These are their stories.

FULLA T: <i>I come
from these streets</i>

00:25.792 --> 00:27.703
This is where it all
started for me.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.173
That's why I'm always happy
to be back home, baby!

00:30.230 --> 00:31.402
You know? This is it!

00:31.464 --> 00:32.943
Been flying around the world,

00:32.999 --> 00:35.639
but it's about what's going on
right here in these streets, baby.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.342
New York City, that's
where I'm from, the hood!

00:38.405 --> 00:40.749
Yeah! Want to do
the boom, boom, boom?

00:40.807 --> 00:42.150
(EXCLAIMING)

00:43.743 --> 00:45.347
Artists get big these days

00:45.412 --> 00:47.824
and they lose touch with
where they're coming from.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.862
So you gotta come back and touch
these bricks right here, baby!

00:50.917 --> 00:52.919
Keep it really, really real!
You know what I'm saying?

00:52.986 --> 00:54.021
That's what I'm talking about.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.623
Charity, I'm talking
about children.

00:55.688 --> 00:59.602
In every neighborhood. Your
neighborhood, you feel me?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.733
Tonight, we do a little promo.

01:01.795 --> 01:05.538
You know, this new album. This really,
honestly, is my best album ever.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.599
Everybody ready?

01:06.666 --> 01:07.701
ALL: Yeah!

01:07.767 --> 01:12.443
So, Fulla T, this new CD
is definitely a departure.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.644
Yeah, this is definitely
a different direction,

01:14.707 --> 01:17.984
but, you know, Nightshade, I've
been in this game a long time.

01:18.044 --> 01:21.514
And I felt like it was time to
do something for the community,

01:21.581 --> 01:25.222
'cause trust me, baby, it's
like gangsta this, thug that.

01:25.652 --> 01:28.360
It's crazy out here and it's time to
do something to save these babies.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.601
Well, you know, you're
definitely doing your thing.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.864
You know, giving the people
a little something new.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.996
That's what's up.

01:34.060 --> 01:38.133
Well, let's pop a listen to
his new single, Seen Nuttin'.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.709
Nightshade, don't play it.
Let me say it.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.408
Let me drop it like it's hot.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.744
All right. Do your thing!

01:44.804 --> 01:45.839
All right.

it's about doing what's good

02:12.665 --> 02:16.135

working the night shift, huh?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.237
Happy to be here.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.899
Uh, real name
is Terrance Smith.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.841
But, uh, you listen
to rap music, right?

04:59.899 --> 05:00.934
Regularly.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.877
Yeah, well, then you
know him as Fulla T.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.408
Who's that?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.545
No ID. He won't
give us his name.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.523
He was standing over the body with a gun.
Said he didn't kill the guy.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.353
Girlfriend?

05:17.417 --> 05:20.864
No. That's, uh, Norma
Robbins, aka Nightshade.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.696
DJ. She was
interviewing Fulla T.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.699
So what's your story?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.030
It's a dangerous city.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.006
Your sector crew
almost blew me away.

05:32.565 --> 05:33.805
Sector crew?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.542
Why didn't you ID yourself? You
could have gotten yourself killed.

05:37.603 --> 05:38.707
Who the hell are you?

05:38.771 --> 05:40.580
Logan. Major Case.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.145
Oh. What are you
doing here?

05:43.710 --> 05:46.020
(SCOFFS) Losing sleep.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.018
See any witnesses?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.493
You're kidding, right?

05:50.583 --> 05:51.891
Actually, no, I'm not.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.191
Everybody?

05:53.252 --> 05:55.391
Yeah, well, he had
some people with him.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.124
Do you know who they were?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.466
No. Never met them
before tonight.

06:01.394 --> 06:04.466
Everything hip-hop in this borough
goes through my task force.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.736
You don't want any part of it.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.000
Why not?

06:07.066 --> 06:09.672
Look at me. Look at you.
You see any difference?

06:09.969 --> 06:13.348
NYPD's not supposed to
engage in racial profiling.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.247
For the most part.

Hey, Wheeler, meet, uh...
What's your name?

06:19.746 --> 06:20.918
Williams.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.187
Williams.
He's a hip-hop cop.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.821
He's so deep undercover, he
almost got his head blown off.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.967
Here, push me in the car.
Make it look good.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.230
Okay, let's go.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.175
Hey, smile for the camera.

06:40.099 --> 06:43.080
There's been a lot of trouble around here.
Intel put them in.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.106
Anything else you want
to tell us?

06:45.271 --> 06:46.477
Yeah.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.984
Good luck, Major Case.

chillin' when there's a killin'.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.785
Too many of our brothers and
sisters getting blown away.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.887
Next time it goes down,
have something to say.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.622
This was the first in what
was supposed to be a series

07:02.688 --> 07:04.690
of public service
announcements for the city.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.896
He's advocating snitching?

07:08.161 --> 07:11.836
We called it "working together
to keep your community safe."

07:11.898 --> 07:13.377
But then Fulla was killed.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.311
Kind of cuts the value
of the PSA.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.780
Logan, okay.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.817
So, who knew
about this project?

07:19.872 --> 07:21.374
It was very closely held.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.149
There was a detective at the
crime scene, Harry Williams,

07:24.210 --> 07:26.554
said he was part
of the hip-hop task force.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.383
There is no hip-hop
task force.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.659
He's part of the Gang Unit,
and he's connected.

07:30.716 --> 07:31.751
Use him as a resource.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.856
Actually, he wanted us to kick
the whole case back to his unit.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.958
I don't blame him.
You're on his turf.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.100
Major Case wasn't my decision.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.003
It was the mayor's.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.599
I hope he made the right call.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.371
(SIGHING)

07:49.435 --> 07:52.439
Okay, so maybe
Fulla T was killed

07:52.505 --> 07:54.007
to send the community a message

07:54.073 --> 07:56.110
and the community
has its back up

07:56.175 --> 07:58.280
over the 50 shots
fired in Queens.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.388
Maybe not everyone in his
entourage was loyal to his cause.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.988
LOGAN: Yeah, I bet someone in
this elevator knows the truth.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.731
Be prepared to hit
a wall of silence.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.364
We already have.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.858
Check it out.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.796
The DJ, Nightshade?

08:14.861 --> 08:18.673
She told me she had never met anyone from
Fulla's entourage before last night.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.872
LOGAN: Hmm, those two
look very cozy.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.711
Looks like there's been
a killin' and she's chillin.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.424
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

08:42.587 --> 08:43.692
What's up?

08:43.756 --> 08:45.360
What's up is you lied to me.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.766
You told me you didn't know anyone
who was with Fulla T last night.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.170
Nightshade don't snitch.

08:52.231 --> 08:55.075
Well, enlighten us. Is it snitching
to say you know somebody?

09:05.111 --> 09:06.249
WHEELER: We got
you on tape.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.985
It looks like you know
the girl pretty well.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.185
If you're worried about what your
coworkers are going to think,

09:11.250 --> 09:13.491
don't, 'cause we're gonna walk
out of here all pissed off

09:13.553 --> 09:15.464
like you didn't give us
what we wanted to know.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.302
Yeah. I met her before.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.265
What's her name?

09:26.666 --> 09:27.804
Carmen.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.039
Does Carmen have a last name?

09:29.101 --> 09:31.138
I don't know.
She hung with Fulla.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.780
I only met her once before.
At Tommy's party.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.914
And Tommy would be...

09:36.976 --> 09:40.719
Tommy Marconi.
He owns Run Records.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.525
Well, we're coming back
with a subpoena.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.065
Don't worry about that.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.582
I know. You didn't expect
me to look like this.

10:12.745 --> 10:13.951
No one ever does.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.822
That's 'cause people
think hip-hop's a color.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.451
It's not.
It's a business.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.928
WHEELER: These guys were
with Fulla T last night.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.991
Hey, I'm Switzerland.
I don't get involved.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.126
Try again.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.132
We can place this woman
at one of your parties.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.737
Look, I throw a party
every week.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.138
I got magazines
on my coffee table too.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.044
PBA Monthly.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.974
There's a picture
of me in it, you know.

10:40.506 --> 10:43.146
Oh! There you are.
It's a good likeness.

10:43.743 --> 10:44.949
Can you read that?

10:46.679 --> 10:51.219
"Run Records, Tommy Marconi.
Pictured with DJ Bobby Boyd."

10:51.784 --> 10:54.424
Oh, here he is
in Fulla's entourage.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.558
I didn't make the connection.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.934
Tommy, you do a lot of
business in the city, right?

11:01.394 --> 11:03.704
Concerts, private parties,
appearances...

11:03.763 --> 11:05.470
And you're gonna need
all kinds of permits,

11:05.531 --> 11:08.740
so you're not thinking of hindering
our investigation, are you?

11:10.770 --> 11:11.942
Off the record?

11:15.074 --> 11:19.147
Bobby Boyd, club DJ, works out of
the Banger Bar at St. Nick's Pub.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.057
What can I get
for you, Detectives?

11:31.123 --> 11:32.966
We're looking for Bobby Boyd.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.005
We understand he deejays here.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.077
Friendly response, huh?

11:42.601 --> 11:43.807
There's a friend.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.294
What're you doing, coming here?

12:00.352 --> 12:03.925
Hey, I'm not a psychic. I didn't
know this was your private club.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.832
Yeah, well, you work
undercover, you gotta fit in.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.097
(SIGHS)

12:07.359 --> 12:08.394
What do you want?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.407
We're looking for a DJ
named Bobby Boyd.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.106
He's not your shooter.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.108
Look, man, I told you, I ain't
seen nothin', all right?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.202
Watch your attitude!

12:16.268 --> 12:17.611
I ain't seen nothin', man.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.947
That's better.
And you're lucky.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.546
(SCOFFS)

12:23.175 --> 12:24.950
That's harassment, man!

12:30.916 --> 12:33.453
I'm not having such a good
feeling about this guy Williams.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.090
There's a thin line between
cops and perps, right?

12:36.155 --> 12:37.657
Who said that?
You did.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.099
Yeah, well, he walks
right up to that edge.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.530
Yeah, where you at, baby girl?

12:44.163 --> 12:49.044
1607 Frederick Douglass?
Apartment what? 4B?

12:50.069 --> 12:51.548
I'm gonna head over
there right now, baby.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.527
Bobby Boyd? Police, with
some Fulla T questions.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.895
So that's what you're gonna do
now, you're gonna impede me?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.333
In the lobby, where I live?

13:12.391 --> 13:14.166
You gonna stand there
and impede me?

13:14.226 --> 13:15.398
Let's talk about
this upstairs...

13:15.461 --> 13:16.906
No, I want everybody
to hear this.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.205
These cops, they want to ask
me questions in my home, man!

13:20.266 --> 13:21.404
They can get a warrant.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.777
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, Bob, Bob.
We don't need a warrant.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.338
We just want to
talk to you upstairs.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.747
I ain't got nuttin' to say.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.524
He got nuttin' to say.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.090
Come on, man. You know
I'm not gonna talk.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.890
You know I'm not gonna talk.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.596
Look, man. I'm no snitch.
I'm no snitch, man!

13:46.659 --> 13:49.367

25:59.257 --> 26:01.897
You don't have a motive
You have a theory.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.166
Remember how that's different?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.571
We understand, Chief.
Good.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.269
Because what I got is the
mayor spitting blood at me.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.273
What about Gordon's gun?

26:10.335 --> 26:11.336
Waiting for ballistics.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.475
Waiting? What kind of an
outfit are you running, Danny?

26:14.539 --> 26:17.918
Don't wait. You should be jamming
them till you get a report.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.048
I still gotta tell you how to work
the system after all these years?

26:21.112 --> 26:23.854
Well, a call from you
might speed things up.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.030
What did you say, Detective?

26:29.554 --> 26:30.897
I'm just saying, Chief.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.536
I mean, we all know
the politics here.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.128
But we haven't
dropped the ball.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.540
You haven't?

26:45.670 --> 26:47.081
Here's what I think.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.682
Be right, Logan.
Be right.

26:51.076 --> 26:54.148
Because I'm thinking the
worst decision lever made

26:54.212 --> 26:56.715
was letting the mayor
kick this to Major Case.

26:58.483 --> 27:01.191
I want Detective Harry Williams
back on this case now.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.833
Chief! I don't care about protocol.
You follow his lead.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.663
Logan for the defense.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.669
I appreciate it, Logan.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.902
Don't do that again.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.775
Worst decision lever made?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.212
Probably.

27:18.670 --> 27:22.982
This case, one witness gets
killed, another disappears.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.486
Seem like more than
a rap rivalry?

27:25.944 --> 27:28.015
Yeah, well, these entourages,

27:28.079 --> 27:30.582
they could be running drugs, they
could be running guns. Who knows?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.129
But I'll tell you one thing.
Whatever it is, I got a feeling

27:33.184 --> 27:35.460
that our Detective Harry
is up to his eyeballs in it.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.558
Harry, not answering his cell.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.096
Find him.

27:58.743 --> 27:59.915
(EXCLAIMS)

28:00.512 --> 28:01.923
You can't sleep here, sir.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.291
The way this city's changed,
I can't sleep anywhere else.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.854
The box is all my
NYPD salary can afford.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.025
Detective Vann, we need to
talk to Harry Williams.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.592
According to his sergeant, he's
supposed to be working with you.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.968
You're Major Case. He told
me he was working with you.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.238
He told you that?

28:18.296 --> 28:19.866
Yeah. Last night he
said he was on loan.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.411
Wouldn't be here today.
You check his house?

28:22.467 --> 28:25.004
Twice. You have any idea
where we might find him?

28:26.071 --> 28:27.482
You might want to
try his girlfriend.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.816
Patricia, a bank VP, Metro
Federal on 14th Street.

28:30.975 --> 28:32.420
A cop dating a banker?

28:33.111 --> 28:34.681
When her bank
was robbed last summer,

28:34.746 --> 28:36.453
Harry was on
the investigating team.

28:36.915 --> 28:38.588
He kept checking in
on her, you know?

28:38.983 --> 28:40.792
Oh, he had to make sure
she got over the trauma.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.530
Well, I don't see
his picture anywhere.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.764
You think he'd tell her
he was undercover?

28:48.827 --> 28:50.238
They started dating
in the summer?

28:51.229 --> 28:53.709
That's too soon for an undercover
to reveal his assignment.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.472
That could backfire
in too many ways.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.911
Hmm. Been there, burned
that, huh, Wheeler?

28:58.403 --> 29:02.715
Detectives, I rushed back from
lunch when they called me.

29:02.774 --> 29:03.809
What's wrong?

29:03.875 --> 29:05.377
It's about
your boyfriend, Harry.

29:05.443 --> 29:06.513
Is he all right?

29:06.578 --> 29:10.048
You know, I keep telling him, undercover's
too dangerous, get out of it.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.651
No, no, no, no. We're just
trying to locate him.

29:11.716 --> 29:13.059
You don't know where he is?

29:13.118 --> 29:15.621
Well, you know, there's
bureaucracy in the department,

29:15.687 --> 29:18.065
paperwork gets lost,
that kind of thing.

29:18.323 --> 29:19.495
When's the last
time you saw him?

29:19.557 --> 29:20.627
Last night.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.402
He said he had to clean up
some mess Major Case made.

29:23.828 --> 29:24.932
You should call them.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.240
We are Major Case.

29:27.799 --> 29:30.143
Did he mention anything
else, about the mess?

29:30.568 --> 29:32.241
He was on the phone
half the night.

29:33.404 --> 29:34.644
Playing the hero.

29:35.006 --> 29:36.679
Any idea who he was rescuing?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.088
His goddaughter, Carmen.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.815
Carmen Rivera is
Harry's goddaughter?

29:43.181 --> 29:45.422
So he says. He talks
to her every day.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.824
She'd better be
his goddaughter.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.929
Harry, you're hurting me!

29:49.988 --> 29:52.195
Just get in the car.
You don't got a choice.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.845
LOGAN: We ask Williams
about Bobby Boyd,

30:08.907 --> 30:10.887
the next thing we know,
Boyd flies off a roof

30:10.942 --> 30:12.683
and Williams gets
there before we do.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.424
I tell him we're on our way
to Carmen Rivera's apartment,

30:15.480 --> 30:18.689
Carmen disappears, and Gordon
Thomas beats us to her address.

30:18.750 --> 30:22.163
Oh, yeah, and his girlfriend,
who knows that he's undercover,

30:22.220 --> 30:24.427
says that Carmen is
Harry's goddaughter.

30:25.456 --> 30:29.063
So, Detective Harry Williams has
just moved from lead investigator

30:29.127 --> 30:30.367
to lead suspect.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.664
I can't wait to tell
the Chief of D's.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.973
Oh, yeah, well, I say we kick this
whole mess back to the Gang Unit, huh?

30:36.034 --> 30:37.843
He's their problem. I'd
rather stay out of it.

30:38.369 --> 30:39.643
Logan, you looking for me?

30:49.914 --> 30:52.292
You can't think I had anything
to do with the Fulla T murder.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.330
Why did you you lie to your
buddies on the task force?

30:54.752 --> 30:56.561
And why did you go
AWOL for 24 hours?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.500
I had to take care
of some business.

30:58.556 --> 30:59.864
Okay, what business?

31:00.158 --> 31:01.899
My business.
It's not your business.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.705
Where is Carmen Rivera? You
know, your, uh, goddaughter.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.004
All right.
I know her.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.444
Yeah, right.
So let's hear it.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.078
(SIGHS)

31:14.839 --> 31:17.149
Carmen and I grew up
in the projects together.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.189
It wasn't easy for her. Father
gone, mother worked three jobs.

31:20.411 --> 31:23.221
A few years ago, her brother
took a bullet to the spine.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.487
Paralyzed.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.126
To this day, he won't
tell us who shot him.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.089
Uh-huh. Well, she's a
witness to a homicide.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.067
Where is she, Harry?

31:34.325 --> 31:35.861
I wouldn't tell you
if I did know.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.399
NYPD doesn't exactly have a perfect
record of protecting witnesses.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.410
What, are you crazy?
You need to bring her in.

31:41.466 --> 31:44.572
A dozen other people witnessed the shooting.
Lean on them.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.775
I am leaning on you!

31:47.005 --> 31:50.680
It is your sworn duty as a
police officer to bring her in!

31:54.279 --> 31:56.555
Why are you protecting
Fulla T's murderer?

31:56.614 --> 31:57.649
That's not what's
going on here.

31:57.715 --> 31:58.785
That's what it looks like.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.557
Look, I'm trying to
keep Carmen alive.

32:01.986 --> 32:04.990
If NYPD takes her in,
she's a dead woman.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.365
If you hide her, it's
obstruction of justice.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.529
Is it?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.368
Does that mean you're
gonna go behind my back?

32:10.428 --> 32:11.429
Report me to IA?

32:11.496 --> 32:12.566
I don't know.
Do I have to?

32:13.564 --> 32:14.599
(SCOFFS)

32:17.268 --> 32:18.645
Go ahead and snitch.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.749
One way or another,

32:20.805 --> 32:23.376
you always find a way to bring
your brother officers down.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.977
Hey! Don't push me on that!

32:25.043 --> 32:27.080
Hell, why don't you just shoot
me, like you did the other...

32:27.145 --> 32:29.022
Hey! I've had it with you!

32:30.181 --> 32:31.421
Hold on! Hold on!

32:31.916 --> 32:33.190
Where is she?

32:33.251 --> 32:35.857
Somewhere safe, very safe.

32:41.893 --> 32:42.894
Excuse me.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.412
And that was your idea
of staying out of it?

32:53.204 --> 32:55.810
Well, yeah, till he stops
holding out on us.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.642
Okay, for what it's worth,

32:57.709 --> 33:01.816
the D.A. has authorized you to pick up
Carmen Rivera as a material witness.

33:01.879 --> 33:04.485
Great. Does he have any
idea of where she is?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.395
No. Do you?

33:06.918 --> 33:08.454
Yep, I got a hunch.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.357
And it's a long drive.

33:16.527 --> 33:18.734
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

33:26.437 --> 33:28.280
Not too sugary
for you, Detective?

33:29.107 --> 33:30.381
No, it's just right.

33:30.975 --> 33:32.977
My grandson's gonna be furious.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.956
I told Harry
I'd keep Carmen here.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.091
We'll make sure she's okay.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.760
I'm sure you'll try.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.857
(SIGHS) Wheeler,
we've got a long drive.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.194
Would you like some
lemonade for the road?

33:47.258 --> 33:48.464
Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.241
That girl's cold as ice.

33:52.663 --> 33:54.939
All the heart's been
cried out of her.

33:54.999 --> 33:58.344
She won't tell you anything, Detectives.
I know her.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.183
Well, thank you for your
help, Mrs. Williams.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.844
Oh, I don't want your thanks.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.846
I want your assurance that nothing's
going to happen to that poor child,

34:08.679 --> 34:11.056
because if something does
happen to her,

34:12.150 --> 34:14.255
her blood is on your hands.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.009
You want to stop?

34:33.103 --> 34:34.344
Get some food?

34:47.952 --> 34:49.761
Carmen, I know you're afraid.

34:50.621 --> 34:54.034
But you don't really want to see Fulla's
killer get away with this, do you?

34:55.893 --> 34:57.429
How do you know what I want?

34:58.196 --> 35:00.198
Look, I know we're
from different worlds.

35:00.665 --> 35:01.837
And that in your world...

35:01.899 --> 35:02.900
My world?

35:03.501 --> 35:06.072
You don't know nothin' about my world!
Where'd you grow up?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.117
We moved around.

35:11.242 --> 35:13.017
Right, "we."

35:13.744 --> 35:16.520
You had a mother and a
father who loved you,

35:16.914 --> 35:18.325
who raised you up...

35:18.382 --> 35:20.953

nice place to live,

35:22.420 --> 35:23.524
Well, I had some...

don't know jack about my world.

I don't need an escort.
Where is she?

35:42.106 --> 35:43.779
Isn't that what
we were asking you?

35:44.175 --> 35:46.121
You terrify my girlfriend
at her workplace.

35:46.177 --> 35:47.713
You take Carmen,
from my grandmother's!

35:47.778 --> 35:48.848
I mean, what the hell is that?

35:48.913 --> 35:52.019
You took her out of state when
you knew we had a judge's order.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.188
Detective Williams, I don't
care who this woman is

35:54.252 --> 35:55.526
or what she means to you.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.190
I don't care about
your special status.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.735
One more move,
your badge is gone.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.565
She didn't talk, did she?

36:04.095 --> 36:07.474
Of course not. But just the
fact that you brought her in?

36:07.965 --> 36:09.706
You might as well have just
signed her death warrant.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.178
Oh, yeah, well,
that's all very dramatic.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.511
But the fact is, people
keep dying around you

36:13.571 --> 36:14.982
and it's never your fault.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.518
Don't preach, Detective.

36:17.241 --> 36:18.345
You want my badge?

36:19.877 --> 36:22.050
Here, you can have it.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.446
I hate to say it,
but Harry may be right.

If she stays in New York,

36:46.137 --> 36:48.174
she either pulls a Lil' Kim
or she's a dead woman.

down to North Carolina.

was gonna happen?

and I was gonna lose it?

37:25.309 --> 37:28.586
Or that I'm gonna get scared 'cause
people seeing me talk to NYPD?

cares about Fulla T?

at that punk,

but Fulla's killer
can just walk away?

to tell us who killed Fulla T,

38:04.782 --> 38:07.194
but there is one question
I'd like you to answer.

38:07.251 --> 38:08.423
What is that?

38:10.254 --> 38:11.255
Why?

38:12.790 --> 38:13.860
Why?

38:15.693 --> 38:17.001
Fulla...

38:18.462 --> 38:20.237
He said something.

38:21.165 --> 38:22.508
Said what?

38:22.767 --> 38:25.839
He said something that somebody
thought was disrespectful.

38:27.405 --> 38:29.407
Fulla was disrespectful to you?

38:29.473 --> 38:32.613
No. Fulla treated
me special.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.518
Not like Gordon.

38:35.946 --> 38:37.983
Gordon gets mad real easy.

38:40.284 --> 38:41.490
And then he hits you?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.591
I don't know.
You know, sometimes,

38:45.656 --> 38:47.761
I might have misspoke myself.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.237
But Gordon didn't like that you
and Fulla were together, did he?

38:50.294 --> 38:51.602
We was just hanging out.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.198
We was just a part of the crew!

38:53.264 --> 38:55.835
So you came here,
to the station, that night.

38:58.302 --> 38:59.542
Gordon showed up.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.943
He said Fulla was weak,

39:03.641 --> 39:07.088
and he was a sellout for saying
that we should snitch to the cops.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.425
Yeah, and Fulla didn't
take that, did he?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.481
No.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.561
He said that Gordon
wasn't a real man.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.762
He said a real man
wouldn't hit a woman.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.767
And then Gordon shot him.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.127
That was it.

39:53.624 --> 39:56.104
Fulla T lost his life
over "who's the man."

40:10.107 --> 40:12.144
I heard Carmen's gonna testify?

40:13.644 --> 40:14.782
I don't see it.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.258
That's right.
I know all about it.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.253
She doesn't have to testify.

40:23.354 --> 40:25.766
You're gonna confess
to the murder of Fulla T.

40:25.823 --> 40:27.131
And why would I do that?

40:27.191 --> 40:30.035
Because no matter what,
you're going down.

40:31.195 --> 40:33.175
Why would you want to bring
Carmen down with you?

40:35.866 --> 40:37.402
She's got you, doesn't she?

40:38.836 --> 40:40.042
(CHUCKLING)

40:42.139 --> 40:44.983
What is it with you cops, always
trying to save the damned?

40:46.177 --> 40:47.247
(SIGHING)

40:48.279 --> 40:51.158
I plead manslaughter. My bid
is eight and I'm out in five.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.360
WHEELER: And what
about Bobby Boyd?

40:53.918 --> 40:55.363
Did he just fall off the roof?

40:55.686 --> 40:56.824
Bobby who?

40:57.888 --> 40:59.128
Manslaughter.

41:00.825 --> 41:02.998
And your girlfriend,
Carmen, is bulletproof.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.406
You have my word.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.170
And we're supposed
to trust you?

41:07.231 --> 41:08.767
I don't care if you do.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.506
But trust this.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.409
I don't get a deal?

41:15.105 --> 41:16.607
I can't control my people.

41:18.375 --> 41:21.151
Her sad life could turn tragic.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.054
It's your call, Officers.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.366
(SIGHS) He played me.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.603
Come on, he talked a jury
out of a cop killing.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.144
For him to take a plea...

41:43.567 --> 41:45.706
Do we really think
Carmen's gonna be safe?

41:46.837 --> 41:49.750
I guess Harry really was just
trying to protect Carmen.

41:50.608 --> 41:51.678
Maybe.

41:56.447 --> 41:57.721
(RAP SONG PLAYING)

41:58.305 --> 42:04.262
