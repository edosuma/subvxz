[hisses] You know,
I killed somebody's husband.

I never see you again.

You know, honestly,
I could kinda tell something was going on.

12:42.537 --> 12:44.673
Like, I could feel it.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.776
And then Tom said

13:26.448 --> 13:27.849
I'm okay.

13:32.155 --> 13:35.190
I guess you don't wanna talk
about what happened.

13:35.323 --> 13:38.326
- Talk about what?
- [chuckles]

13:38.460 --> 13:40.796

At first, I thought we could
all go together this weekend,

14:16.398 --> 14:17.332
like old times.

14:17.466 --> 14:19.334
But now I see that you two

14:19.468 --> 14:21.536
need some "alone" time.

14:23.206 --> 14:25.507
Where did you get
that money?

14:25.640 --> 14:28.144
Serafina's mom got it as
a giveaway at some event,

14:28.276 --> 14:31.613
and they couldn't use it,
so they asked if we wanted it.

14:32.148 --> 14:33.315
Okay. Right?

14:33.448 --> 14:35.383
Yeah, why not?

the money, right?

16:32.902 --> 16:36.305

Where is it?

16:37.240 --> 16:41.443
Listen, I don't want you two
involved, all right?

No problem at all.

where you put it.

with the money,

they're gonna send you
back there.

about that.

[car door opens]

22:33.629 --> 22:35.197
[James] You know, babe,

22:35.331 --> 22:38.300
this could really be like
a second honeymoon.

22:40.802 --> 22:42.238
Wow.

22:43.505 --> 22:45.140
This place is really nice.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.994
[sighs] Is something
on your mind?

23:09.098 --> 23:12.001
I didn't recognize you
when you came home.

23:13.269 --> 23:14.836
James Baker.

23:16.639 --> 23:17.973
And you are?

23:19.475 --> 23:21.776
Lisa Rodriguez.

23:27.349 --> 23:28.517
Nice to meet you.

23:31.887 --> 23:34.957
Babe, I'm still
the same man you married.

23:37.026 --> 23:39.328
I don't want you working
for them anymore.

23:41.430 --> 23:43.032
I'm not.

23:43.699 --> 23:45.833
- Really?
- Really.

23:46.902 --> 23:48.137
Why?

23:48.637 --> 23:50.339
I'm just not.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.274
What are you gonna do?

23:53.808 --> 23:55.511
[sighs]
I don't know.

23:58.347 --> 23:59.982
But I'm starting
to get an idea.

24:00.115 --> 24:02.384
- [chuckles]
- Come here.

24:19.601 --> 24:22.504
I got a bad fucking
feeling about this.

24:24.073 --> 24:25.374
You'll be all right.

24:25.974 --> 24:27.842
[footsteps approaching]

24:27.976 --> 24:29.912
Just stay close
to me.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.858
[sighs]

24:46.595 --> 24:47.963
Four of them.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.467
There's Daddy, Mommy

24:52.867 --> 24:54.503
and their two daughters.

24:55.571 --> 24:56.572
Piece of cake.

24:57.272 --> 25:00.175
But hands off my two cupcakes.

25:00.943 --> 25:02.644
'Cause they're mine.

25:04.313 --> 25:07.149
We're just going in to
make sure it's all there.

25:08.650 --> 25:11.487
We're gonna wait
until they're gone

25:11.620 --> 25:12.821
to actually get it.

25:12.955 --> 25:14.323
Ah, fuck.

25:15.224 --> 25:17.092
Where's the fun in that?

25:18.494 --> 25:22.064
Johnny wants it quiet.
And clean.

25:27.469 --> 25:29.538
What Johnny wants,
Johnny gets.

25:30.472 --> 25:32.474
Yeah. He does.

25:35.444 --> 25:36.578
All right.

25:38.514 --> 25:39.648
Come on.

26:36.538 --> 26:37.573
- Wait!
- What?

26:42.010 --> 26:43.278
Is he asleep?

26:46.014 --> 26:47.316
[screams]

26:47.449 --> 26:50.018
- Oh, shit! Go, go, go, go!
- Fuck!

26:58.093 --> 26:59.695
James!

27:07.836 --> 27:09.338
- James.
- Mom?

27:09.471 --> 27:12.341
[Lisa] Go back to your rooms,
right now. Right now!

27:13.075 --> 27:14.443
James.

27:15.277 --> 27:17.012
Give me the gun.

27:18.647 --> 27:20.015
Give me the gun.

27:24.353 --> 27:26.788
[James breathing heavily]

27:30.960 --> 27:32.294
Baby.

27:33.262 --> 27:35.230
You've gotta get help.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.467
I'm all right.

27:51.915 --> 27:54.049
Oh, what the fuck?

27:54.182 --> 27:55.817
We should have killed him.

27:55.952 --> 27:57.152
I need to think.

27:57.286 --> 28:00.122
Think? You're always
fucking thinking!

28:00.255 --> 28:02.558
Stop thinking! All right?

28:03.759 --> 28:05.827
Now we know who the fuck
we're dealing with.

28:05.962 --> 28:07.262
Right?

28:08.196 --> 28:10.832
So why don't we just
fuck off back home,

28:12.067 --> 28:13.535
think of something else?

28:13.669 --> 28:17.472
We'll come back later
and take care of business.

28:21.109 --> 28:23.078
[breathes heavily]
Fuck.

28:24.780 --> 28:27.082
[breathes heavily]

28:59.015 --> 29:00.282
Baby.

29:05.021 --> 29:06.521
I need help.

29:11.259 --> 29:13.428
What are we gonna do
about this?

29:16.131 --> 29:19.534
I don't think we should keep
that in the house for a while.

29:24.907 --> 29:28.210
Baby, I'd understand it
if you want me to leave.

29:29.012 --> 29:30.445
Oh.

29:30.947 --> 29:32.648
No, baby, no.

29:39.122 --> 29:40.722
I'm not gonna leave you.

30:03.112 --> 30:04.713
[doorbell rings]

30:27.669 --> 30:28.770
Every night?

30:30.572 --> 30:33.341
I knew you were having
a hard time, but I...

30:35.777 --> 30:36.913
Yeah.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.648
That's why I need you here.

30:40.716 --> 30:42.919
I'm afraid
I'm gonna hurt my family.

30:44.586 --> 30:45.687
Hey.

30:47.422 --> 30:49.691
We're not gonna
let that happen.

30:49.825 --> 30:50.960
You got me?

30:51.860 --> 30:53.495
It'll just be
for a little while,

30:53.628 --> 30:55.363
just till I get this
under control.

30:55.497 --> 30:57.566
I am here
as long as you need.

30:59.768 --> 31:00.836
Appreciate it.

31:02.071 --> 31:04.673
[therapist on computer] <i>There's
nothing wrong with you, James.</i>

31:04.806 --> 31:05.741
[James scoffs]

31:05.874 --> 31:06.943
<i>I'm serious.</i>

31:07.076 --> 31:09.578
<i>What you experienced
is a normal reaction</i>

31:09.711 --> 31:12.748
<i>to extremely
abnormal experiences.</i>

31:13.815 --> 31:15.250
[James sighs]

31:17.285 --> 31:19.088
[James] So what
am I supposed to do?

31:19.222 --> 31:22.091
How do I tell
from what's real

31:22.225 --> 31:24.426
and what's... you know.

31:25.928 --> 31:29.031
<i>Start with one thing
you can see with your eyes.</i>

31:29.999 --> 31:31.234
<i>The tree.</i>

31:31.366 --> 31:34.569
<i>Then what can you hear
with your ears?</i>

31:34.703 --> 31:37.039
<i>I can hear the buzzing
of my air conditioner.</i>

31:38.074 --> 31:40.609
<i>What can you sense
with your skin?</i>

31:41.777 --> 31:44.981
<i>My collar on my neck.
My watch on my arm.</i>

31:45.680 --> 31:47.382
<i>What do you taste?</i>

31:48.483 --> 31:50.685
<i>The coffee I just drank
on my tongue.</i>

31:51.286 --> 31:54.289
<i>Now, what do you smell?</i>

31:55.992 --> 31:59.162
<i>My perfume. Those flowers.</i>

31:59.294 --> 32:02.397
<i>Focusing on your five senses
will get you out of your head</i>

32:02.531 --> 32:04.399
<i>and back to the present.</i>

32:05.567 --> 32:07.502
<i>Now, you try.</i>

32:08.271 --> 32:09.805
<i>What do you see?</i>

32:13.642 --> 32:15.044
[therapist laughs]

32:15.178 --> 32:17.880
<i>You're going to have to try
a lot harder than that.</i>

32:21.416 --> 32:24.053
Um, Jennifer's drawing.

32:24.187 --> 32:25.922
[therapist] <i>Good.</i>

32:26.055 --> 32:28.390
<i>Now, what do you hear?</i>

32:30.293 --> 32:31.626
[exhales]

32:38.234 --> 32:39.936
[sighs]

32:40.069 --> 32:41.603
[phone beeps]

32:46.341 --> 32:48.443
- [cell phone ringing]
- Ah.

32:50.445 --> 32:52.447
Hey. Talk to me.

32:53.715 --> 32:54.850
What?

32:56.618 --> 32:59.021
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "not yet"?

33:00.923 --> 33:02.524
Look, look,
do what you gotta do.

33:02.657 --> 33:03.758
We went over it, just...

33:03.893 --> 33:05.694
All right.
I'll take care of it.

33:06.295 --> 33:07.762
No worries. We got this.

33:07.897 --> 33:10.699
All right. No, it's cool.
Bye.

33:12.001 --> 33:13.401
[phone beeps]

33:20.076 --> 33:21.743
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

33:25.948 --> 33:29.551
Yeah, honey, I got it all written down.
I won't forget the milk.

33:29.684 --> 33:32.121
Milk, butter, cereal.
I got it, honey.

33:32.255 --> 33:34.489
All right, I'll see you soon.
Love you too. Bye.

33:34.623 --> 33:36.025
Wife busting
the chops again, huh?

33:36.158 --> 33:38.460
Let me give you
a little marriage advice.

33:38.593 --> 33:40.428
She's the boss.
Whatever she says goes.

33:40.562 --> 33:41.763
Happy wife, happy life.

33:41.898 --> 33:43.132
Here's the file
you asked for.

33:43.266 --> 33:45.935
- You take care of that. I gotta run.
- All right.

33:55.344 --> 33:56.345
Hey.

33:56.478 --> 33:58.747
Well, goddamn! Goddamn!

33:58.881 --> 34:01.483
Oh! What you doin'? Oh!

34:01.616 --> 34:04.086
- Are you sneakin' up on me? Huh?
- Yeah.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.188
- Mr. Policeman! Yeah.
- Yeah, well, look at you.

34:06.322 --> 34:09.690
- Look at you, man. Filled out.
- Yeah, little bit.

34:09.824 --> 34:12.395
- You look like a million bucks, brother.
- And you do too.

34:12.527 --> 34:15.364
- Well, they finally let you out, huh?
- Yeah.

34:15.530 --> 34:18.433
I was beginning to think they were
gonna keep your ass locked up forever.

34:18.565 --> 34:21.835
Yeah, well, you know,
it felt like forever.

34:23.272 --> 34:24.839
Listen, coz, uh,

34:25.607 --> 34:27.442
I need your help
on something.

34:28.945 --> 34:32.847
Well, must be serious, huh?
What's in it for me?

34:35.918 --> 34:39.422
More money than you're making
doing what you're doing, bro.

34:39.554 --> 34:40.956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:41.090 --> 34:45.827
I can cut your ass in
for 2% of three million.

34:47.897 --> 34:50.498
Two percent of three million.
Let's see...

34:51.167 --> 34:52.935
That's $60,000.

34:54.569 --> 34:56.705
Well, it must be
something serious, huh?

34:56.838 --> 34:58.673
Well, this is my career
we're talking about.

34:58.807 --> 35:01.710
I'm gonna have to ask
for about 10% on that.

35:04.447 --> 35:05.714
Deal.

35:07.149 --> 35:08.117
You got it.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.752
All right, man.
Let's make some money.

35:10.886 --> 35:12.888
- Let's make some money.
- All right. Welcome back.

35:13.022 --> 35:15.324
Let's make some noise, bro.
Let's go have a beer.

35:15.458 --> 35:17.059
Yeah. Come on.

35:17.193 --> 35:19.895
Let's go find us
a supermodel or two.

35:20.930 --> 35:22.131
Now we're talking.

35:22.264 --> 35:24.066
[both laugh]

35:29.071 --> 35:30.705
[birds chirping]

35:33.641 --> 35:34.642
Sometimes I...

35:34.776 --> 35:38.147
I can't tell what's real...

35:39.482 --> 35:41.217
or what's in my head.

35:41.350 --> 35:45.154
<i>There's nothing to
be ashamed of with PTSD.</i>

35:45.287 --> 35:47.890
<i>You just have to take it
one day at a time.</i>

35:48.523 --> 35:50.026
<i>It takes time.</i>

35:50.159 --> 35:53.661
<i>Your brain is still processing
a traumatic experience.</i>

35:53.795 --> 35:55.663
<i>The next time
you're in that compound,</i>

35:55.797 --> 35:57.799
<i>here's an exercise you can do.</i>

35:57.933 --> 35:59.834
<i>Every time
you look at your thumb,</i>

35:59.969 --> 36:03.805
<i>ask yourself, "Is this real</i>

36:04.873 --> 36:06.409
<i>or is this fake?"</i>

36:06.541 --> 36:08.077
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

36:14.682 --> 36:16.185
Is this real?

36:16.851 --> 36:19.055
<i>Or is this fake?</i>

36:19.188 --> 36:21.090
Or is this fake?

36:21.223 --> 36:22.590
<i>Well?</i>

36:23.259 --> 36:24.060
Real.

36:24.193 --> 36:26.694
<i>Good. That's a good start.</i>

36:26.828 --> 36:29.564
<i>Keep doing it
until it becomes a habit.</i>

36:33.235 --> 36:36.138
[therapist] <i>You're still going
on vacation with your wife?</i>

36:36.939 --> 36:39.375
[James sighs] <i>I don't know.</i>

36:39.508 --> 36:42.811
[therapist] <i>You should. I think
it'd be good for you two.</i>

36:42.945 --> 36:44.813
<i>She needs you too, James.</i>

36:44.947 --> 36:47.316
<i>Just as much as you need her
right now.</i>

36:47.450 --> 36:49.118
<i>Don't shut her out.</i>

36:52.321 --> 36:53.688
[knocking on door]

36:55.524 --> 36:57.126
Mr. James Baker?

37:01.830 --> 37:03.765
- Hello.
- Hey.

37:03.899 --> 37:06.135
Well, I appreciate you
coming down here, sir.

37:06.268 --> 37:07.970
Yeah.
So how can I help you, Sheriff?

37:08.104 --> 37:10.473
Well, it seems we've got
ourselves a little problem.

37:10.605 --> 37:11.907
What kinda problem?

37:12.041 --> 37:14.477
Well, it's probably
not gonna amount to much.

37:14.609 --> 37:16.845
I know you're DEA
and all that.

37:16.979 --> 37:19.681
Well, I got a warrant here
with your name on it.

37:20.682 --> 37:22.384
James Baker, yeah?

37:27.289 --> 37:29.791
"Breach of Peace"?
This is bullshit.

37:29.925 --> 37:32.161
- I just got here.
- [chuckles] Well...

37:32.294 --> 37:34.829
it must have followed you
from San Antone.

37:35.730 --> 37:37.799
- This makes no sense.
- Hmm.

37:37.933 --> 37:40.402
Listen, I got a buddy
in the government.

37:40.536 --> 37:42.271
He sent me your record.
Hope you don't mind.

37:42.404 --> 37:44.806
But I gotta tell ya,
I'm very impressed.

37:45.341 --> 37:47.076
DEA, military. Phew.

37:48.344 --> 37:53.048
But it also says that you
were just diagnosed with PTSD.

37:54.316 --> 37:55.850
Post-Traumatic Stress.

37:55.985 --> 37:58.521
That's a terrible thing.

37:58.653 --> 38:01.856
See, I was in
the service myself,

38:01.991 --> 38:03.926
and, well, let's say
I knew a lot of guys

38:04.059 --> 38:06.061
who pretended they were sick

38:06.195 --> 38:08.898
so they could get a little
extra on their pension.

38:09.932 --> 38:11.534
That's a shameful thing
to do.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.269
What the fuck?

38:14.270 --> 38:16.205
This is signed
by the attorney's office.

38:16.338 --> 38:18.507
There's no judge's signature
on this.

38:18.641 --> 38:19.975
There's not?

38:20.109 --> 38:21.843
No. No.

38:21.977 --> 38:24.113
Let me see
that goddamn thing.

38:27.416 --> 38:30.718
Well, I'll be damned.
You're right. [laughs]

38:32.121 --> 38:33.721
I don't know
what you're trying to pull,

38:33.855 --> 38:35.857
but next time you try
to bring me down here,

38:35.991 --> 38:38.561
you contact my superiors,
my RAC,

38:38.693 --> 38:40.262
and don't waste my time.

38:41.063 --> 38:42.298
Hmm.

38:42.431 --> 38:45.334
Deputy, will you show
this gentleman out?

38:45.467 --> 38:49.004
What the fuck did you have me
come down here for anyway?

38:54.776 --> 38:56.711
[chuckles]

38:56.844 --> 38:58.480
[groans]

39:00.683 --> 39:02.284

39:07.056 --> 39:09.325
- [line ringing]

39:10.426 --> 39:11.961
Yeah, he just left.

39:12.895 --> 39:14.897
[chuckles] Yeah.

39:18.434 --> 39:19.501
[groans]

39:30.079 --> 39:31.746
They're leaving.

39:33.716 --> 39:36.151
This is
an in-and-out job.

39:37.553 --> 39:39.255
No more problems.

39:40.522 --> 39:43.259
This ain't your average
snatch and grab, boys.

39:43.392 --> 39:45.793
We gotta make this one
calculated.

39:46.929 --> 39:49.864
- We'll see about that.
- Yeah, we fucking will.

39:51.233 --> 39:53.435
You gotta keep your head
in this one, man.

39:54.536 --> 39:56.438
Well, let's fucking see.

40:46.388 --> 40:48.057
Ho! Let's go!

40:48.190 --> 40:50.858
What are we waitin' for now?
Fucking Christmas?

40:50.993 --> 40:53.696
Dominic, relax. What if
they forgot something?

40:53.828 --> 40:57.499
Forgot something? What the fuck
are they gonna forget?

40:57.633 --> 40:59.501
Let's fucking do this!

40:59.635 --> 41:02.371
Man.
Keep your fucking head.

41:03.272 --> 41:05.541
[whispers] Ah. Fucking head!

41:59.795 --> 42:01.964
[tapping on dashboard]

42:09.071 --> 42:11.407
[Rudy] You wanna knock
that the fuck off?

42:12.841 --> 42:15.310
[dance music playing
on speakers]

42:30.125 --> 42:31.994
Mom and Dad
are gonna be pissed.

42:32.127 --> 42:33.362
They'll never know.

42:34.530 --> 42:37.199
Isn't that what they say in the
movies before they get caught?

42:37.332 --> 42:39.368
Then they won't be surprised
when they catch us.

42:39.501 --> 42:40.869
You. Catch you.

42:41.003 --> 42:43.105
Catch me. Whatever.

42:44.139 --> 42:45.541
I had nothing to do
with this.

42:45.674 --> 42:47.676
It's not like I invited
the whole school.

42:55.551 --> 42:56.985
Hit that shit!

42:57.119 --> 42:58.554
[rock music playing
on radio]

42:58.687 --> 42:59.688
Oh!

42:59.822 --> 43:01.457
[chuckles]

43:04.293 --> 43:05.961
Didn't get the invite.

43:07.262 --> 43:08.730
It's melon ice.

43:08.864 --> 43:11.300
Yo, yo, yo.
Kiwi's the best flavor, no cap.

43:11.433 --> 43:13.702
Tom, that's so cap, bro.

43:13.836 --> 43:16.738
You're like 50% cap,
50%...

43:16.872 --> 43:18.674
- What?
- [all laugh]

43:18.807 --> 43:20.042
Naughty!

43:21.210 --> 43:23.745
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's fucking go!

43:23.880 --> 43:25.047
Let's go, let's go!

43:25.180 --> 43:27.583
We're doing this,
Tommy boy! Whoo!

43:27.716 --> 43:29.218
Why you so riled up,
Tom?

43:29.351 --> 43:31.553
Why you so riled up
right now?

43:31.687 --> 43:33.222
Good job, bitch!

43:33.957 --> 43:36.625
- So, uh...
- Her parents are gone.

43:36.758 --> 43:39.461
- But what about Natalie?
- Don't worry about her.

43:40.729 --> 43:44.333
Look, I'll handle her,
you handle Dyana.

43:44.466 --> 43:45.534
All right.

43:45.667 --> 43:47.002
[chuckles]

43:47.135 --> 43:49.304
[door bell ringing]

43:50.038 --> 43:51.273
I'll be in my room.

43:51.406 --> 43:53.642
You know, maybe
if you were nicer to people,

43:53.775 --> 43:54.877
you'd have more friends.

43:55.010 --> 43:56.211
Maybe if you weren't,

43:56.345 --> 43:58.013
people wouldn't think
you were so vapid.

43:58.146 --> 43:59.581
[footsteps departing]

44:00.849 --> 44:02.551
[all] Hey!

44:02.684 --> 44:03.920
Whoo!

44:04.052 --> 44:06.421
Okay, okay.

44:06.555 --> 44:08.557
Somebody gonna get it
in tonight!

44:08.690 --> 44:11.126
- Somebody gonna get it in!
- [laughs]

44:11.693 --> 44:13.495
The more, the merrier.

44:29.611 --> 44:31.280
[screaming]

44:35.350 --> 44:38.053
[whispers]
Is this real? Is this real?

44:42.124 --> 44:43.559
[James clears throat]

44:49.164 --> 44:51.099
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

44:56.271 --> 44:58.041
Are you sure you wanna know?

44:58.173 --> 44:59.808
Of course I wanna know.

45:02.678 --> 45:04.646
[sighs] If we can...

45:04.780 --> 45:06.148
James.

45:06.281 --> 45:08.684
Just tell me.

45:11.921 --> 45:13.255
Okay.

45:13.822 --> 45:15.157
Pull over.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.395
[turn signal clicking]

45:21.630 --> 45:23.799
[muffled dance music playing
on speakers]

45:23.933 --> 45:25.767
[muffled chattering]

45:45.754 --> 45:47.356
Are you kidding me?

45:57.033 --> 45:58.433
[grunts]

46:06.875 --> 46:08.377
Damn it.

46:12.848 --> 46:14.182
What?

47:32.061 --> 47:34.429
There was a firefight.

47:38.567 --> 47:40.802
We exchanged gunfire.

47:45.340 --> 47:50.479
After we'd taken the...
the men down...

47:52.380 --> 47:53.715
[exhales]

47:58.054 --> 47:59.621
...there was...

48:02.191 --> 48:03.792
We saw blood

48:05.293 --> 48:08.497
<i>coming from
underneath a closet.</i>

48:14.904 --> 48:17.773
And when we opened the closet,
there...

48:22.044 --> 48:23.378
there were...

48:25.248 --> 48:28.416
a mother
and two daughters.

48:28.951 --> 48:30.186
[Lisa gasps]

48:30.318 --> 48:33.956
They had been killed
by our gunfire.

48:34.090 --> 48:35.323
Uh...

48:36.591 --> 48:39.028
[groans] Babe, I see them.

48:40.196 --> 48:41.596
I see them.

48:42.265 --> 48:43.765
It was an accident.

48:46.401 --> 48:48.336
It's not your fault.

48:50.539 --> 48:53.943
That's just it.
It was. I...

48:56.478 --> 48:58.613
- Baby...
- It was just a mistake.

48:59.381 --> 49:00.682
[sighs]

49:02.118 --> 49:03.752
It was my mistake.

49:05.387 --> 49:06.822
[sniffles]

49:13.095 --> 49:14.696
[sighs]

49:14.830 --> 49:17.532
I love you.
You know that, right?

49:19.467 --> 49:20.735
I love you too, babe.

49:20.869 --> 49:22.671
[chuckles]

49:24.406 --> 49:27.876
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.514
It's okay.

49:33.648 --> 49:35.750
Ah, come over here.

49:42.225 --> 49:44.626
[typing]

50:21.264 --> 50:22.631
Fuck!

50:55.197 --> 50:56.831
Who is she?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.136
[Dominic]
<i>There's a bit of totty for me.</i>

51:01.569 --> 51:04.006
[pop ballad playing, muffled]

51:06.342 --> 51:07.776
[vehicle approaching]

51:07.910 --> 51:09.644
[whispering]
What the fuck?

51:12.647 --> 51:13.883
[engine turns off]

51:14.984 --> 51:17.386
You just scared me.
[laughs]

51:18.354 --> 51:22.124
What are you doing hanging out outside?
[chuckles]

51:24.726 --> 51:26.195
I see you weren't expecting me.

51:26.329 --> 51:29.631
He just looked at me.
Did he just fucking look at me?

51:29.764 --> 51:30.900
[Sebastian]
You okay?

51:31.033 --> 51:32.467
Yeah.

51:33.768 --> 51:36.238
Your dad just asked me
to check on you, so...

51:38.441 --> 51:39.641
That's not my fault.

51:39.774 --> 51:42.510
Oh, now we're blaming
our sister?

51:42.644 --> 51:43.946
You know me.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.114
I know.

51:46.548 --> 51:48.184
Can I show you something?

51:48.317 --> 51:50.186
- Yeah.
- Okay.

51:54.723 --> 51:56.459
I'll fucking rub you,
you fuckin' cunt!

51:56.591 --> 51:58.793
We need to figure
this shit out, man.

52:06.969 --> 52:09.205
Natalie, what's going on?

52:20.483 --> 52:21.616
Where did you get this?

52:21.750 --> 52:24.253
I found it
under the floorboards.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.257
I think my sister
found some money too.

52:31.994 --> 52:34.263
I was doing some research,

52:34.763 --> 52:36.232
and I found this.

52:37.732 --> 52:39.335
"Was arrested
for a string of robberies

52:39.468 --> 52:42.004
that terrorized the city
and sentenced to 15 years,

52:42.138 --> 52:43.571
maximum federal
penitentiary."

52:43.705 --> 52:45.408
None of the money
was ever recovered.

52:45.540 --> 52:47.209
Okay, okay.

52:47.343 --> 52:48.643
We don't know it's his.

52:48.777 --> 52:50.112
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

52:50.246 --> 52:52.281
This money has been here
for a long time.

52:52.415 --> 52:56.385
We don't know any of that.
We don't know anything.

52:56.519 --> 52:57.819
Put it back.

52:58.387 --> 52:59.889
Just put it back.

53:01.524 --> 53:03.492
- Have you told anyone else?
- No.

53:03.625 --> 53:05.660
Good.
Have you spent any of it?

53:05.794 --> 53:07.897
Seriously?
I mean, what are we gonna do?

53:08.030 --> 53:09.697
Mom and Dad aren't
even here right now.

53:09.831 --> 53:11.666
And she's downstairs
acting like a crazy...

53:11.800 --> 53:14.170
- Calm. Nat... Natalie.
- ...wild child!

53:14.303 --> 53:16.405
It's not against the law
to find money.

53:17.339 --> 53:20.109
Okay? We're gonna figure
this out. Not a problem.

53:20.242 --> 53:22.844
Just put it back.
Let's go talk to Jen.

53:23.979 --> 53:26.148
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

53:37.692 --> 53:39.328
[pills rattling]

53:44.467 --> 53:46.668
What the fuck
are you doing?

53:50.339 --> 53:52.041
Fueling the fire.

53:52.575 --> 53:54.676
Fueling my calm.

53:55.643 --> 53:57.046
See, this

53:57.880 --> 54:00.049
is the calm
before the storm.

54:01.183 --> 54:03.618
And it's gonna be
a big fucking storm.

54:05.454 --> 54:06.922
Oh.

54:09.824 --> 54:11.093
[exhales]

54:15.231 --> 54:16.499
[groans]

54:16.631 --> 54:18.601
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

54:18.733 --> 54:21.070
Johnny wanted us
to bring this guy?

54:22.238 --> 54:24.706
Are you gonna
keep it together?

54:24.839 --> 54:28.277
- Rip off your beard!
- Get the fuck off me, bro.

54:29.211 --> 54:32.814
- Chill the fuck out.
- You'll be okay.

54:34.716 --> 54:36.818
[chuckles]

54:36.952 --> 54:40.422
Bro, are you gonna be
the fuck all right?

54:40.556 --> 54:42.191
We got shit to do,

54:42.324 --> 54:44.994
and you gotta have your
fucking brain together, man.

54:46.661 --> 54:47.729
[clears throat]

54:47.862 --> 54:49.198
[exhales]

54:50.032 --> 54:51.733
Let's fucking do it.

54:51.866 --> 54:54.836
Let's fucking do it. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

54:56.005 --> 54:57.839
It's time to play.

54:58.706 --> 55:00.242
Can we fucking play?

55:01.210 --> 55:02.710
Please.

55:13.122 --> 55:14.390
Hey!

55:14.990 --> 55:15.925
Where's Jen?

55:16.058 --> 55:17.526
What's your problem?

55:17.660 --> 55:18.928
Where's my sister?

55:19.061 --> 55:21.397
I don't know.
I think they went to her room.

55:21.964 --> 55:22.898
I'll get her.

55:23.032 --> 55:24.866
I'll check the back.

55:26.969 --> 55:28.803
[pop music playing]

55:33.542 --> 55:34.476
[knocking on door]

55:34.610 --> 55:35.843
Jen.

55:38.846 --> 55:40.316
I need to talk to you.

55:40.449 --> 55:41.517
I'm kinda busy.

55:41.650 --> 55:43.285
It's important.

55:43.419 --> 55:44.920
- Can it wait?
- No.

55:45.588 --> 55:47.089
Fine. What is it?

55:49.892 --> 55:51.527
[whispers] I found
something in my room.

55:51.660 --> 55:53.929
Congratulations. You found
something in your room.

55:54.063 --> 55:57.333
I'm so proud of you.
Now get the fuck out my room.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.035
Where were we?

56:00.169 --> 56:02.338
Let's see what
everyone else is doing.

56:02.804 --> 56:04.240
But, Jen...

56:04.373 --> 56:06.542
There's more important
things going on right now.

56:06.675 --> 56:08.377
- Like what?
- Put your clothes on.

56:08.510 --> 56:10.812
Look, Jen, just 30 minutes.

56:10.946 --> 56:13.015
[chuckles]
Like you can last that long.

56:14.216 --> 56:15.884
Why not?

56:16.018 --> 56:17.486
There's nothing going on
downstairs.

56:17.620 --> 56:19.854
I have stuff to do.
Get dressed!

56:20.723 --> 56:22.524
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

56:22.658 --> 56:23.726
And your boxers?

56:23.858 --> 56:26.195
Fireworks, dude?
Are you, like, 12?

56:29.431 --> 56:30.832
But...

56:30.966 --> 56:32.434
But I love you!

56:35.571 --> 56:37.940
[line ringing]

56:38.073 --> 56:40.842
Pick up. [sighs]

56:40.976 --> 56:43.245
<i>This is Captain James Baker.
Please leave a message.</i>

56:43.379 --> 56:46.415
Dad. Call me.
I need to talk to you.

56:46.548 --> 56:48.050
It's important.

56:51.453 --> 56:53.289
[engine starts]

56:56.492 --> 56:59.428
Fuck it. It's time.

57:00.596 --> 57:01.897
Finally.

57:03.365 --> 57:04.400
Come on.

57:15.077 --> 57:16.211
[Dominic] Hey.

57:16.345 --> 57:17.479
Look at me.

57:17.613 --> 57:20.616
[sniffs] Look at me.

57:20.749 --> 57:22.918
Have I ever let you down?

57:23.052 --> 57:25.554
Pills or no pills?

57:28.257 --> 57:30.025
No.

57:30.159 --> 57:32.027
[Dominic] ...problem.
What are you worried about?

57:32.161 --> 57:34.229
Lighten up. Have a bit of fun.

57:34.363 --> 57:35.364
[claps]

57:35.497 --> 57:38.033
For my brother, man.
You gotta take it cool.

57:38.167 --> 57:39.902
Brother, shmother.

Yeah, it's a fucking problem.

Because we don't have
Johnny's ring.

Who gives a shit about a ring
when you got all this money?

01:06:22.424 --> 01:06:24.260
It's his fucking
dead wife's ring.

01:06:24.392 --> 01:06:26.628
She died when he
was overseas.

01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:28.965
And we're
a hundred grand short.

01:06:31.433 --> 01:06:34.402

I swear, I only took
a few hundred.

01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:08.905
No, no, there's more
than a few hundred missing.

All right, listen.

01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:14.409
I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

Are you sure
it's not gonna...

It's civilian life
I'm not used to.

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:49.558
- Okay.
- You still have the gun in the house?

01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:50.894

Enough with the games,

01:16:25.761 --> 01:16:27.196
Give it up.

01:16:30.532 --> 01:16:32.936

I don't see shit.

01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:19.808
I'm gonna check it out.

01:18:42.664 --> 01:18:44.700

Okay. Where's Sebastian?

01:21:27.029 --> 01:21:27.997
They killed him.

01:21:28.131 --> 01:21:30.465
They stabbed him
over and over.

[Natalie sobbing]

01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:21.070
It'd be a real shame
to put a hole

01:24:21.203 --> 01:24:23.172
in her pretty little face,
wouldn't it?

It's okay.

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:49.631
It's okay. Okay.

Sweetie, sweetie.
Listen. Listen.

01:24:55.104 --> 01:24:56.906
I'm gonna need you
to be strong, okay?

01:24:57.039 --> 01:24:59.708
Now, your mother's downstairs.
I need you to go to her.

01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:01.876
- No.
- Yes, and I want you to use this,

01:25:02.011 --> 01:25:03.845
if you need to, to get away.
You can do it.

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.581
- Dad, no.
- Baby, baby, just go downstairs.

01:25:06.715 --> 01:25:08.084

Go ahead, baby.
All right.

01:25:21.964 --> 01:25:22.999
Hey, Johnny!

01:25:26.268 --> 01:25:27.836
It's James.

01:25:28.803 --> 01:25:30.872
It's just you
and me now.

01:25:33.342 --> 01:25:34.809
Are you listening
to me?

01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:37.712
Let's make a deal.

01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:42.151
I know what you want.

01:25:43.219 --> 01:25:46.022
I'm comin' in.
Don't shoot.

01:25:56.332 --> 01:25:57.665
Drop that shit.

01:25:58.566 --> 01:25:59.969
[gun thuds]

01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:02.104
Don't worry.

01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:05.241
Some things bullets
won't satisfy.

01:26:23.725 --> 01:26:25.294
Hey, we could make a plan.

01:26:25.428 --> 01:26:26.996
[growls]

01:26:39.707 --> 01:26:41.576
All right, motherfucker.

01:26:51.887 --> 01:26:53.688
<i>and Sebastian!</i>

01:26:54.323 --> 01:26:55.991
You gotta go.

01:26:57.193 --> 01:26:59.061
[sheriff]
I wouldn't do that.

01:27:07.303 --> 01:27:08.471
Shoot him.

01:27:09.238 --> 01:27:11.974
Goddamn it, motherfucker,
shoot him!

01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:15.945
You work for me.
Shoot him!

01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:19.281
I don't think
you're getting it, Johnny.

01:27:19.415 --> 01:27:22.717
I think that silencer says
he works for himself.

01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:24.086
Ain't that right?

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.422
That's not
a department-issue gun, is it?

01:27:26.555 --> 01:27:30.259
And that's your money he's got
right there in that bag, Johnny.

01:27:30.392 --> 01:27:32.027
Am I right?

01:27:33.195 --> 01:27:36.098
With everybody dead,
you get all the money.

01:27:36.232 --> 01:27:38.300
All you gotta do
is kill one more.

01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:42.770
But if you kill me, there's
gonna be an investigation.

01:27:42.905 --> 01:27:44.839
But if you take out
poor Johnny here,

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:47.276
well, the good guys win.

All we gotta do is figure out
how to split up the money.

01:27:56.952 --> 01:27:59.955
The money that nobody
but you and me knows about.

01:28:03.858 --> 01:28:06.028

I'll kill you!

about that deal.

- Sheriff.
