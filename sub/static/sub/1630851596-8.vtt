WEBVTT

00:03.829 --> 00:05.353
- Nica,
sometimes when we're together,

00:05.396 --> 00:07.964
<i>you looking at me-- </i>
and I know it's you.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.141
<i>It's not Chucky. </i>
And I live for those moments.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.538
<i>- Okay, so there's just </i>
one left, right?

00:16.581 --> 00:18.018
<i>One doll left.</i>

00:18.061 --> 00:20.411
Open the fucking door!

00:20.455 --> 00:21.586
Shit.

00:21.630 --> 00:24.502
- Our charity matinee,
"Frankenstein,"

00:24.546 --> 00:26.939
will still take place tomorrow
as planned.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.419
- Mom or mayor?
- Excuse me?

00:28.463 --> 00:30.291
- Choose. Because Lexy didn't
sign up for all of this,

00:30.334 --> 00:31.857
and neither did I.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.512
- Why is someone random guy
delivering a Good Guy doll

00:34.556 --> 00:36.688
to Charles Lee Ray's old house?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
<i>- Devon's at </i>
Charles Lee Ray's house.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.173
My name's Devon, by the way.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.480
- What's yours?
- It's Chucky.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.177
- I love you.
I just want to protect you.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.831
- It's over.
We're done.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.181
<i>My dad kissed some lady </i>
at the wake.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.748
<i>My mom's wake.</i>

00:52.791 --> 00:54.706
Real classy, Dad.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.101
- No wonder she jumped.
- Shut your goddamn mouth!

01:00.147 --> 01:02.149
- She killed herself
because of you.

01:06.109 --> 01:08.459
- Kid, thank you!
Finally!

01:08.503 --> 01:11.114
You have no idea
how hard it's been

01:11.158 --> 01:12.811
<i>getting one </i>
of you little shits

01:12.855 --> 01:15.597
<i>to step up and play.</i>

01:22.430 --> 01:26.390
<i>Now, the real fun can start.</i>

01:32.962 --> 01:35.617
- Shit.
- Who is he?

01:35.660 --> 01:40.448
- Someone who never had
the balls to be one of us.

01:40.491 --> 01:43.886
- Or the height.
Dude's almost as short as you.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.671
- I know, right?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.377
What do we do?

01:56.420 --> 01:57.987
What do you think?

02:13.263 --> 02:15.004
I'm looking for Jake Wheeler.

02:15.047 --> 02:18.442
- And you are?
- A friend.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.792
- Jake's sure got
a lot of new friends.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.099
Is he here?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.144
Nope.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.623
What about your mother?

02:27.712 --> 02:32.630
- She died.
- She died? How?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.502
- Not that it's any
of your business,

02:34.545 --> 02:36.112
but she killed herself.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.375
Jesus.

02:38.419 --> 02:43.032
Well, is your dad home?

02:43.075 --> 02:47.210
- Yeah, actually, he is.
This way.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.789
So how do you know Jake?

03:00.832 --> 03:03.313
- We met in an online
chat group.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.359
For Good Guy doll collectors.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.710
Said he has one for sale.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.539
- I didn't know he was
getting rid of Chucky.

03:11.582 --> 03:15.847
- Is Chucky here?
I'd love to take a look at him.

03:15.891 --> 03:19.286
I mean,
if he's as mint as Jake says.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.289
- I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.955
Huh.
He was just here.

03:39.741 --> 03:44.702
- Your dad or the doll?
- Both, actually.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.269
Uh...

03:46.313 --> 03:48.184
Dad?

03:49.881 --> 03:54.103
My mistake.
I guess he went out.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.193
- With the doll?
- I guess.

04:03.155 --> 04:06.724
Where'd he go, your dad?

04:06.768 --> 04:09.945
- Probably out
with his girlfriend.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.163
Mm-hmm.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.693
- You don't mind if I take
a quick look around, do you?

04:18.736 --> 04:23.437
just in case he's here?
The doll, I mean.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.916
I don't mind.

04:48.810 --> 04:52.117
- Look, I'm sorry.
I know how weird this is.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.597
What's your name?

04:53.641 --> 04:56.774
- Junior.
I'm Jake's cousin.

04:56.818 --> 04:57.993
Andy.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.911
You said your dad
went out with his girlfriend.

05:02.954 --> 05:06.175
You really think
he brought the doll with him?

05:06.218 --> 05:08.830
- I'd rather not think
about that at all. Thanks.

05:10.614 --> 05:11.833
Why don't we call him?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.620
What, now?

05:16.664 --> 05:19.057
- Yeah.
Let's try his cell.

05:19.101 --> 05:23.323
- And ask if he has Chucky?
- Humor me, okay?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.393
You having a bath?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.439
I was about to.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.537
He always leaves it.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.401
Be careful.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.924
It's freezing.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.798
Do you have any idea where

06:47.842 --> 06:50.105
your father and his girlfriend
may have gone?

06:50.148 --> 06:51.454
Nope.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.630
- What about Jake?
Where's he tonight?

06:53.674 --> 06:57.155
- Sorry.
I have no idea.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.462
Lot going on.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.507
I'll let myself out.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.076
But if you see Jake,
tell him to call me.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.255
And Junior, if you see
the doll, stay away from him.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.518
Okay?

07:38.327 --> 07:41.765
I knew he'd never look in here.

07:41.809 --> 07:45.029
The guy's got serious issues.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.820
- Why didn't you kill him?
- He had a gun.

07:52.863 --> 07:56.606
I hate guns.
They're like my Achilles heel.

07:56.650 --> 07:59.783
Along with axes, fire,

07:59.827 --> 08:04.527
and those big,
industrial-size fans.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.619
I just wanted to fuck with him.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.796
I got other plans
for Andy Barclay.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.581
What'd you do with my dad?

08:14.624 --> 08:17.018
Down the laundry chute.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.196
You hungry?

08:45.612 --> 08:48.484
- He doesn't exactly need
help killing people.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.705
No, he doesn't.

08:51.748 --> 08:55.883
- So why bother?
What's he getting out of it?

08:55.926 --> 08:57.754
Seriously, why has Chucky

08:57.798 --> 08:59.756
been trying to get one of us
to kill somebody?

08:59.800 --> 09:00.975
What would that accomplish?

09:01.018 --> 09:05.022
- Maybe it's part
of some voodoo spell.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.371
Maybe it has something to do

09:06.415 --> 09:10.332
with that doll you got
at the bus station.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.552
I left it in the kitchen.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.229
Here's Chucky!

09:56.291 --> 09:59.947
- Who are you?
- I'm Kyle. I'm with Andy.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.168
- Okay, how many
freaking Chuckys are there?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.866
- That's a good
freaking question.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.215
We need to kill all of them.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.434
- We need to find Devon first.
- Who's Devon?

10:09.478 --> 10:10.958
His boyfriend.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.656
- He's not my--
he's at Chucky's old house.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.092
Okay.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.920
Well, trust me, if we're going
into the lion's den,

10:16.964 --> 10:19.270
we're gonna need help,
and we're gonna need Andy.

10:19.314 --> 10:22.230
And we're gonna need
a lot of coffee.

10:28.149 --> 10:32.762
- Where's Andy?
- Don't worry, he's on his way.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.198
Okay, so Chucky can, like,

10:34.242 --> 10:36.636
splinter himself
into other dolls?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.594
Only Good Guy dolls.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.683
It has to be
an identical vessel.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.729
Except for Nica.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.775
- Who's Nica?
- Poor girl at the asylum.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.952
Chucky possessed her, too.
I know.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.826
Whack.
Fucking voodoo, man.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
A few weeks ago,
there were three dolls.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.786
Jake, we thought
you had the last one.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.005
But here's the thing.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.268
If Chucky can corrupt
an innocent,

11:00.311 --> 11:04.011
if he can get just one kid
to kill someone,

11:04.054 --> 11:07.710
he can make an entire army.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.320
Either of you kill
anyone lately?

11:12.236 --> 11:15.675
- Will you please
just let it go?

11:15.718 --> 11:17.328
Somewhere here in Hackensack,

11:17.372 --> 11:20.244
I fear some poor kid
is Chucky's friend to the end.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.159
- It's not Devon.
Devon's fine.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.900
And they've probably
got him as bait,

11:23.944 --> 11:25.815
so what are we waiting for?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
- Don't worry.
I have a plan.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.524
I'm really sorry.
I feel terrible.

11:39.568 --> 11:44.225
But Andy would kill me if
I let anything happen to you.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.532
This is all I could think of
to keep you safe.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.711
No.

11:51.754 --> 11:55.758
- I promise to do everything
I can to save your friend.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.239
Everything's gonna be okay.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.763
And now...

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
you are, too.

12:12.079 --> 12:16.518
Hi, honey! I'm home!

12:17.737 --> 12:19.869
Nica?

12:19.913 --> 12:23.699
Ooh, where did Nica go?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.223
Where is she?

12:26.267 --> 12:29.357
Oh, I see a little foot.
Ha!

12:29.400 --> 12:31.098
- That was fun!

12:31.141 --> 12:32.882
Please don't hurt me.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.102
- One thing you should know
about me, Nica.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.887
I would never, ever hurt you.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.541
- No, please.
I'm scared of needles.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.456
- Don't be scared.
It's just a little.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.587
You won't feel anything.

12:45.416 --> 12:49.769
- Oh, I'm disappointed in you,
Tiff.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.687
Here we are again, huh?

12:55.731 --> 12:58.342
This will make--how many times
have I killed you?

12:58.386 --> 13:00.431
- Is it three?

13:00.475 --> 13:05.262
No, four. Four, if you count
human bodies and doll bodies.

13:05.306 --> 13:10.180
This--this will be
the last time, babe.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.834
I promise.

13:11.878 --> 13:15.272
- You can't kill me, Chucky!
You need me!

13:15.316 --> 13:18.623
You need me,
or the plan won't work!

13:20.451 --> 13:21.670
Think about it.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.284
- Oh, thinking is for losers.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.677
Think again.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.944
She's right, bro.
We need her.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.642
And I'm kind of used
to having her around.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.514
Sweetface.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.124
Help her up.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.735
Yeah, help me up, asshole.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.477
Get up.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.653
Fuck you, Chucky.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.091
Thank you, Chucky.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.876
Come to Mama, come to Mama!

13:53.920 --> 13:56.009
- Who's a good little Good Guy?

13:56.052 --> 13:59.490
Who's a good little Good Guy?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.493
Aww!

14:02.537 --> 14:04.931
- Looking good, doll.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.238
You're not looking so bad
yourself, Sweetface.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.110
Mwah!

14:10.153 --> 14:14.766
- So where are they?
- They're right downstairs.

14:14.810 --> 14:18.074
- Follow me.
- Okey-doke.

14:18.118 --> 14:23.210
- Come into my inner sanctum.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.952
Watch your step. We wouldn't
want to have any accidents.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.045
Chucky, it worked.

14:34.612 --> 14:38.573
- Thanks to my pal here,
Mr. Patricide.

14:38.616 --> 14:44.100
Proud of him.
Now, he's gonna do his friend.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.624
- That's you.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.151
You want me to kill Devon?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.022
- Not yet.
He could still be useful.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.112
Good thinking.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.593
- Are you ready to meet
the troops, Chucky?

15:05.252 --> 15:08.385
- Pretty soon, the good guys
are gonna come for him,

15:08.429 --> 15:13.521
and then, we're gonna
party like it's 1999.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.699
What does that mean?

15:17.742 --> 15:19.309
We're gonna fuck 'em up.

15:19.353 --> 15:23.226
- Oh.
- And then, vaya con Dios.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.880
Kill 'em all.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.751
Any questions?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.753
Um, uh...

15:28.797 --> 15:31.931
is there an age limit?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.542
On potential victims?

15:34.585 --> 15:37.066
Good question.

15:37.110 --> 15:40.591
No babies.
We're not savages.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.985
And they make better stooges
anyway.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.857
Anyone else?

15:45.901 --> 15:47.555
Uh, yeah.

15:47.598 --> 15:51.602
Could you define "baby"?

15:51.646 --> 15:56.781
I mean, they can get pretty
wily once they start walking.

15:56.825 --> 16:00.916
- Well, let's just say nobody
under the age of five or six.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.614
Fair enough?

16:03.658 --> 16:05.442
What about twins?

16:05.486 --> 16:07.749
Those freaks
will gang up on you.

16:07.792 --> 16:11.883
- I mean, two against one?
That's not a fair fight.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.625
Am I right?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.717
- See you tomorrow night
at the theater.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
- Don't be late.
- You got it.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.241
All right.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.388
- No cookies
for bad little boys.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.782
There you go, Sweetface.

17:24.826 --> 17:29.178
- Don't get me started
on Andy Barclay, bro.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.137
You should have seen
the look on his face

17:31.180 --> 17:34.270
when I whacked his babysitter.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.969
- Chucky!
We did it!

17:38.013 --> 17:40.885
- We--

17:40.929 --> 17:43.758
- Chucky, Chucky,
Chucky, Chucky,

17:43.801 --> 17:47.805
- In a minute.
- Ah, Jesus Christ, huh?

17:47.849 --> 17:51.679
So what's all this been like?

17:51.722 --> 17:56.379
- You wouldn't believe the
amount of tail I get like this.

17:56.423 --> 18:01.689
- Fuck.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.777
Dick, too.

18:09.175 --> 18:13.614
- You know, Chucky, you really
need to get over yourself.

18:13.657 --> 18:17.008
You are the most
self-involved man

18:17.052 --> 18:21.143
I have ever met
in my entire life.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.407
- Are you talking to me?
- Or me?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.148
Well, strictly speaking,

18:26.192 --> 18:29.282
neither one of you
is a man at all.

18:29.325 --> 18:33.503
A real man would know
how to treat a lady!

18:41.685 --> 18:46.647
- But I don't see no lady.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.475
- Oh!

18:54.220 --> 18:56.918
Oh, no.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.838
No!

19:03.881 --> 19:06.884
- Oh, shit.
- Please.

19:06.928 --> 19:10.018
- At least she treats me
with a little respect.

19:10.061 --> 19:14.762
- Okay. Tiff, you're right.
I'm sorry.

19:14.805 --> 19:18.026
And maybe I should
just get over myself.

19:18.069 --> 19:22.204
And sometimes that takes
real sacrifice.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.296
Kill her.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.256
- No! No! No, no, please!
Please!

19:30.299 --> 19:31.257
I'm sorry?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.694
- You know what
that does to me.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.089
- Chucky,
she's a part of you, too!

19:38.133 --> 19:41.049
- Plenty of me
to go around nowadays.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.704
There's 72 more of me
on that truck.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.271
Now kill the bitch.

19:45.314 --> 19:48.970
- Okay, Chucky.
I'll do it for you.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.276
But I don't want to do it.

19:50.319 --> 19:53.888
- Who is it you're afraid
of losing, Tiff?

19:53.931 --> 19:55.542
Me or her?

19:57.108 --> 20:00.721
- Please! Please!
Please! Please! Please!

20:00.764 --> 20:02.853
Junior, do it.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.643
I'm sorry, Chucky.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.559
I'm sorry.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.454
Chucky, I mean, who is she?

20:38.498 --> 20:40.282
She's your goddamn trophy.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.024
Now do her,
or I'll do the three of ya!

21:10.051 --> 21:13.881
You fucking hag!

21:13.924 --> 21:15.709
You're upside-down.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.236
Back off, Junior!

21:21.280 --> 21:24.457
Who are you gonna trust to get
you out of this shithole town

21:24.500 --> 21:27.329
before they find
your father's corpse?

21:27.373 --> 21:29.462
Me?

21:29.505 --> 21:30.724
Or that?

21:46.217 --> 21:48.481
I'm done with you, Chucky!

21:48.524 --> 21:53.834
I'm done with your petty shit
and your massive ego

21:53.877 --> 21:56.750
and your tiny fucking dick!

21:57.881 --> 21:59.970
Tell me something, Sweetface.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.059
Did you ever wonder

22:02.103 --> 22:05.236
how those cops found you
that night in Chicago?

22:08.588 --> 22:11.112
We never kill anybody
together anymore.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.509
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

22:16.552 --> 22:17.510
Going out.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.734
Don't wait up for me, Red.
Eh?

22:29.435 --> 22:33.743
- I'd like to speak to
Detective Mike Norris, please.

22:33.787 --> 22:37.791
I have some information
on the Lakeshore Strangler.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.054
- I'm gonna get you for it!

22:40.097 --> 22:42.230
- I'm gonna get you!

22:42.273 --> 22:46.539
- One of me's gonna get you!
No matter what!

22:46.582 --> 22:50.456
- You'll do no such thing.
You need me, Chucky.

22:50.499 --> 22:55.417
Besides, it's like
my mother always said.

22:55.461 --> 22:59.552
If you love somebody,
set them free.

22:59.595 --> 23:03.425
Well, I'm setting us
both free, Chucky.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.906
Vaya con Dios!

23:05.949 --> 23:09.083
See you in hell!

23:11.433 --> 23:14.262
- Mic drop.

23:14.305 --> 23:17.308
All right, Junior, look alive.
Make yourself useful.

23:17.352 --> 23:20.355
I'm gonna make her
go nighty-night.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.620
- No! Tiffany, stop!
Please don't! Tiffany, don't!

23:27.362 --> 23:30.800
So noisy.
All right.

23:30.844 --> 23:35.283
Here, honey.
Help me with your auntie, Nica.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.938
I have more important
things to do.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.031
- What's that?
- Isn't it cute?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.642
My darling Glenda
gave it to me.

23:46.686 --> 23:50.951
They have exquisite taste.

23:59.002 --> 24:04.530
A little something to welcome
Andy Barclay with a bang.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.760
All right.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.504
You took one?

24:22.548 --> 24:23.897
Can I keep him?

24:26.856 --> 24:28.510
Okay, you can keep him.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.687
But you gotta
clean up the mess.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.843
Get up!

25:03.763 --> 25:05.199
Kill the twink.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.131
No!

25:32.922 --> 25:34.228
Andy.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.272
The front door's
booby-trapped.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.013
Yeah, I figured.

25:37.057 --> 25:39.233
- They delivered
the dolls in a truck.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.539
Andy, they're all alive.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.932
- Just get out.
Now.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.894
Another goddamn head.

25:47.937 --> 25:48.895
Why not?

25:52.812 --> 25:54.074
Where are the dolls, Chucky?

25:54.117 --> 25:56.729
- I'm not telling you,
short stack,

25:56.772 --> 25:58.469
so don't even bother.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.515
- Oh, you're gonna tell me,
all right.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.386
Where the fuck are you?

26:02.430 --> 26:06.086
I'm everywhere.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.304
Andy?

26:09.611 --> 26:12.745
Help me! Please, help!

26:14.224 --> 26:15.399
Andy?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.621
Kyle, no!

26:56.702 --> 27:00.357
Lexy, wake up.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.532
Wake up.

27:10.367 --> 27:13.849
The bitch drugged us.

27:13.893 --> 27:16.243
How long were we asleep?

27:23.380 --> 27:28.168
- Mom sent like 100 texts
from the hotel.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.518
She's actually
worried about me.

27:30.561 --> 27:33.826
- Devon's still
at Charles Lee Ray's old house.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.828
Jake.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.004
What?

27:38.047 --> 27:39.179
Check your alerts.

27:50.059 --> 27:53.106
- No.
No, not Devon.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.239
Jake, I'm so sorry.

28:17.173 --> 28:21.656
<i>together: </i>

28:43.025 --> 28:46.159
Jake?

28:46.202 --> 28:49.379
- Devon.
I thought you were dead.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.384
- I was looking
for you everywhere.

29:04.133 --> 29:07.267
- So what happened?
- That woman.

29:07.310 --> 29:11.010
She was at Bree's wake.
She planted a bomb.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.142
What about Andy and Kyle?

29:13.186 --> 29:17.756
I got out, but...

29:17.799 --> 29:18.800
they were both inside.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.938
We're on our own.
Again.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.548
Kyle said that

29:27.591 --> 29:31.508
Chucky needs to convince
an innocent to kill somebody.

29:31.552 --> 29:35.512
If he does, he'll have an army.

29:35.556 --> 29:39.212
But who's the innocent?

29:39.255 --> 29:41.301
And who did they kill?

29:41.344 --> 29:43.303
He killed his dad.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.306
- Who?
- Junior.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.786
Oh, shit.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.309
- There was a room
full of Chuckys,

29:49.352 --> 29:51.311
living ones, at the house.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.791
There was dozens of them.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.532
But they took them away
in a truck.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.143
- Those dolls
could be anywhere.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.496
The mayor's benefit is today.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.281
Some fundraiser
for children's hospitals.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.979
- Chucky's gonna hit
the benefit.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.328
<i>We gotta get to the theater.</i>

30:10.330 --> 30:11.810
I'd like to thank all of you

30:11.853 --> 30:14.116
for coming
to this important event,

30:14.160 --> 30:17.424
a benefit not only
for the children of Hackensack,

30:17.467 --> 30:21.515
but for children in need
all over the USA!

30:22.908 --> 30:25.519
What better way to celebrate
the occasion

30:25.562 --> 30:27.260
than to announce the identity

30:27.303 --> 30:29.392
of our special
celebrity guest--

30:29.436 --> 30:32.526
and I know this will come
as a wonderful surprise--

30:32.569 --> 30:34.049
Oscar-nominated actress

30:34.093 --> 30:36.704
and professional poker player,
Jennifer Tilly!

30:36.747 --> 30:40.751
- Hi!

30:40.795 --> 30:43.885
Hello, Hackensack.
Hello!

30:43.929 --> 30:45.321
Lexy!

30:46.932 --> 30:48.585
Help me.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.588
- Hello!
You look ravishing.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.286
Thank you for coming.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.158
Oh, please, sit down.
I love you all.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.729
- Junior?
- Lexy!

31:03.470 --> 31:05.951
- Every Better Days hospital
in the country

31:05.994 --> 31:10.694
will receive a priceless gift
from her personal collection...

31:10.738 --> 31:15.308
of vintage Good Guy dolls!

31:15.351 --> 31:19.486
- "Hi. I'm Chucky. Wanna play?"

31:19.529 --> 31:20.922
That's right.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.665
72 authentic Good Guy dolls
that will be transported

31:24.708 --> 31:27.233
immediately after the show
to Teterboro Airport,

31:27.276 --> 31:30.932
and from there to needful
children from coast to coast.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.414
Let's hear it
for Ms. Jennifer Tilly! Whoo!

31:34.457 --> 31:35.719
Thank you.

31:35.763 --> 31:38.026
- Chucky!
I want Chucky!

31:38.070 --> 31:43.118
- Okay. So let's all go watch
"Frankenstein," all right?

31:43.162 --> 31:45.599
- Yay!
- Let's go.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.906
- Chucky wants to watch
"Frankenstein" too!

31:47.949 --> 31:50.865
- No, sweetheart,
those are for sick children

31:50.909 --> 31:52.911
who need someone
to take care of them.

31:52.954 --> 31:57.176
- Well, I'm sure one measly,
little, sick child

31:57.219 --> 31:59.091
can take care of himself.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.657
Here, sweetheart.

32:00.701 --> 32:05.053
Your very own Good Guy doll.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.272
Be careful, you two.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.274
Don't get into
too much trouble.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.369
Lexy!

32:18.153 --> 32:19.111
Junior?

32:27.249 --> 32:29.121
Junior?

32:56.583 --> 33:00.935
<i>- Look, it's moving. </i>

33:12.425 --> 33:14.862
<i>It's moving. </i>
It's alive!

33:14.905 --> 33:16.385
Junior?

33:16.429 --> 33:20.694
<i>- It's alive, it's alive, </i>
it's alive, it's alive!

33:20.737 --> 33:22.043
What did you do to Junior?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.871
<i>In the name of God!</i>

33:23.914 --> 33:25.829
See for yourself.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.048
<i>- Now I know what </i>
it feels like to be God!

33:40.801 --> 33:44.065
<i>I'm Maria.</i>

33:44.109 --> 33:45.980
<i>Will you play with me?</i>

33:53.292 --> 33:54.989
<i>See how mine floats?</i>

34:07.132 --> 34:10.048
This is my favorite part.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.052
<i>- No, you're hurting me! </i>
No!

34:27.848 --> 34:29.241
Hi.

34:31.808 --> 34:32.722
Thank you.

34:42.123 --> 34:45.518
- Chucky?
Where are you going?

34:45.561 --> 34:47.694
- I'm gonna get some popcorn.
- Oh, yeah?

34:47.737 --> 34:48.956
You want some?

34:55.180 --> 34:56.137
Hey.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.144
Please, Junior.

35:04.406 --> 35:06.582
- I think we should
get back together.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.630
You do?

35:10.673 --> 35:13.023
It's incredible.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.199
What is?

35:18.899 --> 35:22.946
I used to be so afraid.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.167
Afraid to compete,
afraid of my dad.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.867
I was even afraid of you.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.001
- That's--

35:34.044 --> 35:38.005
- But Chucky
changed everything.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.011
How's that?

35:45.969 --> 35:48.233
He taught me how to be a man.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.371
<i>- The brain which was stolen </i>
from my laboratory

35:56.415 --> 35:58.286
<i>was a criminal brain.</i>

36:00.767 --> 36:02.116
What'd I miss?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.857
<i>- After all, it's only </i>
a piece of dead tissue.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.294
- Here you go.
<i>- Only evil can come of it.</i>

36:06.338 --> 36:08.209
<i>Your health will be ruined if </i>
you persist in this madness.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.605
<i>- I'm astonishingly sane, </i>
Doctor.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.738
<i>- You have created a monster, </i>
and it will destroy you!

36:34.235 --> 36:35.410
Nathan?

36:40.894 --> 36:41.982
What's going on?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.739
- Ha!

37:56.012 --> 37:58.885
- One of us, Lexy.
That's who you are.

37:58.928 --> 38:02.802
You're a winner.
And you know what winners say.

38:02.845 --> 38:06.284
Fuck the losers
who can't take a joke.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.113
Come with us.

38:10.157 --> 38:13.943
Come with us, and it'll be
better than it ever was before.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.816
You and me.
Together.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.821
I'm not like that.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.039
Bullshit!

38:23.083 --> 38:26.826
You're exactly like that,
and you know it.

38:26.869 --> 38:31.831
You and Junior are made
for each other.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.462
Caroline.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.159
Hey.
Care?

38:56.203 --> 38:57.639
Devon's gonna get you
out of here,

38:57.683 --> 38:59.902
but you have to hold his hand
the whole time.

38:59.946 --> 39:03.253
- But the movie's not over yet.
- I know. We'll watch it later.

39:03.297 --> 39:06.518
But right now, Devon's
gonna get you out of here.

39:06.561 --> 39:07.736
But what about Daddy?

39:23.056 --> 39:24.318
- He's coming!
Go!

39:29.932 --> 39:31.717
Chucky!

39:33.327 --> 39:37.853
Here I am, asshole!
Come and get me!

39:37.897 --> 39:39.942
You know what, Jake?

39:39.986 --> 39:41.770
Once I hack you to pieces,

39:41.814 --> 39:45.121
the world's gonna forget
all about you.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.820
Eventually,
they're gonna forget the names

39:47.863 --> 39:50.779
of everybody who
died here tonight.

39:50.823 --> 39:55.741
All they'll remember is
the <i>number</i> of people I killed.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.264
My body count.

39:57.307 --> 40:00.223
And they'll remember <i>my</i> name.

40:00.267 --> 40:03.270
And from now on,
when they think of Hackensack,

40:03.313 --> 40:05.881
they won't think
about families,

40:05.925 --> 40:08.014
they won't think about kids
growing up

40:08.057 --> 40:11.626
to be doctors or CEOs

40:11.670 --> 40:15.630
or Instagram influencers.

40:15.674 --> 40:20.243
They won't think about
pathetic losers like you, Jake.

40:20.287 --> 40:24.160
They'll think of Hackensack
as ground zero

40:24.204 --> 40:29.252
for the army of me
that invaded America.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.558
Not if we stop that truck.

40:30.602 --> 40:33.387
Not if I kill you first.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.409
You're thinking,

40:55.453 --> 40:59.108
"How could a little doll
possibly be so strong?"

40:59.152 --> 41:02.068
Doesn't make any sense!

41:02.111 --> 41:05.027
- You're nothing
against the power

41:05.071 --> 41:07.943
of the great, almighty
Damballa!

41:12.992 --> 41:14.210
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

41:14.254 --> 41:18.301
- I loved you, Junior.
I honestly did.

41:21.566 --> 41:24.699
Because you were kind,

41:24.743 --> 41:27.093
'cause you were loyal,

41:27.136 --> 41:30.705
'cause you forgave me
every time I screwed up.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.925
I was a bitch.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.404
God, I was such a bitch.

41:34.448 --> 41:39.409
And you were
the sweetest boy ever.

41:42.804 --> 41:45.372
I think I'm gonna be sick.

41:45.415 --> 41:47.722
He's not a boy,
he's a man.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.855
No, Junior, you're a boy.

41:49.898 --> 41:52.771
And you will never be the kind
of man he wants you to be.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.733
Kill her now, Junior!

42:01.127 --> 42:04.260
But if you fall...

42:04.304 --> 42:07.437
this time I'll catch you.

42:07.481 --> 42:08.743
I promise.

42:08.787 --> 42:10.702
Bullshit!

42:10.745 --> 42:12.225
Kill her!
Or I will!

42:19.580 --> 42:21.582
Leave her alone.

42:27.153 --> 42:30.330
She's not like us.

42:30.373 --> 42:36.031
I think I'm gonna be sick.

42:42.472 --> 42:43.604
Lexy.

42:43.648 --> 42:46.128
Junior! No! No!

42:46.172 --> 42:49.654
No, Junior, please don't.
Oh, my God.

42:49.697 --> 42:53.266
Tell everyone...I'm sorry.

42:53.309 --> 42:56.095
No, no, no.

43:17.072 --> 43:18.944
<i>- There he is! </i>
The murderer!

43:25.124 --> 43:26.647
Sacrilege!

43:26.691 --> 43:30.782
You dare defy
the almighty Damballa?

43:30.825 --> 43:33.523
- Yeah. I've been doing
some pushups lately.

43:35.047 --> 43:37.049
Look at you now, Chucky.

43:37.092 --> 43:39.878
You're pathetic.
You're nothing.

43:42.315 --> 43:45.274
- You're just
Teddy Ruxpin without a knife.

43:51.237 --> 43:53.369
I don't need that shit.

43:53.413 --> 43:55.110
All I need are my bare hands.

43:59.332 --> 44:01.769
All that anyone's
gonna remember tonight

44:01.813 --> 44:03.379
is that we kicked your ass.

44:03.423 --> 44:08.646
- The world won't believe you.
They never do.

44:08.689 --> 44:10.560
Admit, Jake.

44:10.604 --> 44:14.042
When I killed your dad,
you were thrilled.

44:14.086 --> 44:16.349
I saw it in your eyes.

44:16.392 --> 44:18.481
- I knew he'd never be able
to hurt me again.

44:18.525 --> 44:20.919
And this is how you thank me?

44:22.921 --> 44:24.836
Then I was pissed.

44:24.879 --> 44:26.707
I'm still pissed...

44:26.751 --> 44:28.709
that we never got the chance
to work it out,

44:28.753 --> 44:29.971
or to be friends again.

44:30.015 --> 44:32.931
I was your friend.

44:32.974 --> 44:35.411
I accepted you.

44:35.455 --> 44:39.720
Your father never would have.

44:39.764 --> 44:42.592
Yes, he would have.

44:42.636 --> 44:46.335
If he only got the chance
to meet Devon.

44:46.379 --> 44:49.164
Oh, that is so gay.

45:15.974 --> 45:17.758
Watch your fucking mouth.

45:17.802 --> 45:20.239
That's my boyfriend
you're talking about.

45:54.186 --> 45:57.058
What--what about Daddy?

45:57.102 --> 45:59.147
- Sweetie.

46:15.642 --> 46:16.817
Junior?

46:28.568 --> 46:31.266
- Good job, good job.
The plane leaves at midnight.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.528
Don't be late.

46:32.572 --> 46:35.270
Or I'll kill you.

46:35.314 --> 46:38.056
Just joking.
Actually, I'm not.

47:11.089 --> 47:13.787
It's Andy.

47:29.934 --> 47:32.893
No!

47:32.937 --> 47:34.460
He did it.

48:05.665 --> 48:07.972
- Andy, I don't think
we've had the pleasure.

48:08.015 --> 48:12.237
I'm Tiffany, the doll,
not the person.

48:12.280 --> 48:15.457
It's complicated.

48:15.501 --> 48:17.372
- You're not as cute
as I thought you'd be.

48:17.416 --> 48:19.461
Just drive.

48:19.505 --> 48:22.029
If you know
what's good for you.

48:50.362 --> 48:53.582
Morning, sleepyhead.

48:59.458 --> 49:03.157
I really like you, Nica.

49:03.201 --> 49:07.988
After all we've been through.

49:08.032 --> 49:10.382
Just one snag.

49:10.425 --> 49:14.995
I couldn't run the risk that
Chucky would sneak back in.

49:16.605 --> 49:19.478
Who knows what that little shit
would do to me?

49:23.047 --> 49:26.572
Sometimes a girl's just
gotta advocate for herself.

49:29.357 --> 49:31.533
So I fixed it.

50:20.191 --> 50:23.411
<i>- Hackensack's motto </i>
is "defendit numerus,"

50:23.455 --> 50:26.153
<i>Latin for "safety in numbers."</i>

50:26.197 --> 50:28.590
<i>But what happens </i>
when we feel outnumbered?

50:28.634 --> 50:30.201
<i>How do we fight back?</i>

50:30.244 --> 50:31.898
<i>How do we stand a chance </i>
against an enemy

50:31.941 --> 50:34.248
<i>who disguises himself </i>
as our friend?

50:34.292 --> 50:36.207
<i>Maybe the best way </i>
is to know the difference

50:36.250 --> 50:38.296
<i>between friend and enemy.</i>

50:38.339 --> 50:41.255
<i>And that means digging </i>
deep enough to find out.

50:41.299 --> 50:43.431
Sometimes bad things happen.

50:47.653 --> 50:51.178
We try to stop them.

50:51.222 --> 50:52.962
Sometimes we can't.

50:59.230 --> 51:02.189
If people die,
it's up to us to remember them.

51:06.889 --> 51:09.414
Junior wasn't born
with evil in his heart.

51:09.457 --> 51:10.980
Chucky put it there.

51:13.766 --> 51:16.464
Like he tried to do with me.

51:19.250 --> 51:20.425
But you guys stopped him.

51:22.514 --> 51:24.429
Thanks for saving my life.

51:50.063 --> 51:52.848
<i>- We can never tell anyone </i>
what really happened.

51:52.892 --> 51:55.851
<i>Not even Ms. Fairchild.</i>

51:58.724 --> 52:00.204
<i>- But the three of us </i>
are enough.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.989
<i>Even though believing </i>
in one another is not easy,

52:03.032 --> 52:05.296
<i>standing together </i>
does not come naturally.

52:05.339 --> 52:08.299
<i>But when we do, </i>
united like that,

52:08.342 --> 52:12.520
<i>that's how we fight back. </i>
That's how we win.

52:22.356 --> 52:23.749
Oh.

52:23.792 --> 52:26.708
Hello.
I didn't see you there.

52:26.752 --> 52:32.192
I'm Chucky, and I hope
you enjoyed my new show.

52:32.236 --> 52:35.891
You were probably wondering
how it all turned out.

52:35.935 --> 52:40.809
Who lived, who loved, who died.

52:40.853 --> 52:44.987
The eternal questions,
explored by authors

52:45.031 --> 52:48.991
such as Austen,
Shakespeare,

52:49.035 --> 52:50.776
Mancini.

52:50.819 --> 52:56.347
And speaking of who died,
let's review, shall we?

52:56.390 --> 52:59.088
I scored one electrocution...

52:59.132 --> 53:01.178
<i>one decapitation... </i>

53:01.221 --> 53:03.223
<i>one defenestration... </i>

53:03.267 --> 53:05.094
<i>one exsanguination... </i>

53:05.138 --> 53:06.792
<i>an explosion... </i>

53:06.835 --> 53:09.229
<i>an awesome dishwasher mishap,</i>

53:09.273 --> 53:10.752
<i>a neck break,</i>

53:10.796 --> 53:12.232
<i>and one beat down</i>

53:12.276 --> 53:17.498
<i>I'm sure you agree </i>
the victim 100% had coming.

53:17.542 --> 53:19.935
<i>And let us not forget</i>

53:19.979 --> 53:22.721
<i>the good, </i>
old-fashioned stabbings.

53:24.984 --> 53:28.509
<i>And exactly how did </i>
I kill the cat?

53:28.553 --> 53:32.731
<i>Probably better I leave that </i>
to your imagination.

53:32.774 --> 53:35.429
<i>Making for a grand total</i>

53:35.473 --> 53:38.563
<i>of 21 victims.</i>

53:38.606 --> 53:41.740
Well, at least the kids
got their happy ending.

53:41.783 --> 53:44.786
True love, BFFs,

53:44.830 --> 53:47.615
and a whole bunch
of dead parents!

53:51.097 --> 53:54.535
But what about Andy and Nica,

53:54.579 --> 53:57.538
and that truck full of Chuckys?

53:57.582 --> 54:00.672
What kind of ending
do they get?

54:00.715 --> 54:06.025
And now,
a word from our sponsors.
