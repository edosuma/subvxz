00:03.376 --> 00:06.793
(haunting, gentle music)

00:16.675 --> 00:21.675
(water gurgles)
(haunting music)

00:26.232 --> 00:28.982
(haunting music)

01:17.744 --> 01:19.547
(man sighs)

01:19.547 --> 01:22.047
(quiet music)

01:38.344 --> 01:41.011
(woman panting)

01:57.337 --> 02:00.170
(gravel crunches)

02:19.762 --> 02:22.095
(man sighs)

02:48.890 --> 02:51.833
- [Man] Hey, who are you?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.700
- Do you know what happened?

02:59.490 --> 03:00.940
You mean you didn't see that?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.443
- [Man] See what?

03:05.399 --> 03:08.183
- There was a big flash of
light, everything went bright.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.240
- I didn't see anything.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.030
- Do you have a TV?

03:13.030 --> 03:16.818
Can we see if there's
anything on the news, please?

03:16.818 --> 03:17.651
- Okay.

03:20.590 --> 03:21.423
Come on.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.223
Are you alone?

03:32.329 --> 03:33.163
- Yeah, why?

03:54.280 --> 03:56.030
- Can I get you something to drink?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.233
- Sure, sure.

04:12.179 --> 04:13.690
I'm Sasha, by the way.

04:13.690 --> 04:14.540
- [Man] I'm Cole.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.443
- Thanks.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.600
- [Cole] What are you doing way out here?

04:31.950 --> 04:33.250
- I was with my boyfriend,

04:36.390 --> 04:40.983
and then he was gone, he disappeared.

04:42.159 --> 04:43.523
- I'm sure he's around.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.860
What do you say we go into town?

04:50.850 --> 04:52.230
He probably got lost.

04:52.230 --> 04:54.050
It's pretty easy to do around here.

04:55.292 --> 04:57.106
- Yeah, yeah.

04:57.106 --> 05:00.356
(quiet, pulsing music)

05:15.460 --> 05:16.983
- Sorry about the outhouse.

05:18.130 --> 05:19.757
- Oh, it's all right.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.007
I've been camping before.

05:29.742 --> 05:32.825
- What do you say we call it a night?

05:34.690 --> 05:36.290
I won't try anything, I promise.

05:39.150 --> 05:39.983
- Okay.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.550
- [Cole] You take the
bed, I'll take the couch.

05:46.550 --> 05:47.383
- Are you sure?

05:48.659 --> 05:49.493
- Yeah.

05:50.840 --> 05:51.990
Can I get you anything?

05:54.056 --> 05:55.193
- Just a glass of water.

05:56.685 --> 05:57.852
- [Cole] Okay.

07:08.214 --> 07:10.258
- [Sasha] There you are.

07:10.258 --> 07:11.091
- Morning.

07:14.023 --> 07:15.323
Know what you're thinking.

07:16.340 --> 07:17.720
It's the 2000s, and this guy

07:17.720 --> 07:19.420
still gets his water from a creek.

07:20.414 --> 07:22.464
- (chuckles) I wasn't gonna say anything.

07:26.930 --> 07:29.330
- Just like to enjoy the
simpler things in life.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.650
- I wish my life was simple.

07:40.212 --> 07:42.168
- Would you mind?

07:42.168 --> 07:43.418
- [Sasha] Sure.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.740
- So, I was thinking about
what you said last night,

07:50.740 --> 07:51.990
about the flash of light.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.969
What do you think it was?

07:54.969 --> 07:55.802
- Hey, wait!

07:55.802 --> 07:56.635
- Sasha!

08:00.870 --> 08:01.703
Hey.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.960
What was all that about?

08:06.390 --> 08:07.690
- There was a little girl.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.873
- Where?

08:29.760 --> 08:30.593
I'm sorry.

08:31.900 --> 08:32.732
- For what?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.460
- I know you're worried right now.

08:39.490 --> 08:41.450
- First Blake, then this
little girl shows up.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.640
I just don't know what the
hell's going on anymore.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.893
- I don't know about any girl, except you.

08:48.810 --> 08:50.933
But it can't just be the two of us.

09:01.260 --> 09:02.110
Have you read it?

09:04.960 --> 09:06.843
- Parts of it, when I was younger.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.410
- You don't think-

09:13.410 --> 09:15.030
- The rapture?

09:15.030 --> 09:15.863
- Yeah.

09:15.863 --> 09:18.963
- I thought about it,
but everybody's gone.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.520
- I didn't think about that.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.020
I mean, surely we're not the only two

09:28.020 --> 09:29.420
sinning nonbelievers around.

09:30.667 --> 09:34.084
(Cole and Sasha chuckle)

09:37.910 --> 09:39.163
- Blake believes in God.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.230
- [Cole] Yeah, me, too.

09:46.230 --> 09:48.113
- Then where has everybody gone?

09:49.150 --> 09:49.983
- I don't know.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.130
I'm gonna find out, though.

09:54.130 --> 09:57.047
(shimmering music)

10:06.680 --> 10:08.280
- Somebody doesn't get out much.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.480
- Yeah, one of the perks of
working at the factory, I guess.

10:15.290 --> 10:16.123
- Yeah.

10:16.123 --> 10:18.370
- I don't really go into
town unless I have to.

10:19.330 --> 10:23.103
- I don't suppose you get
Chinese delivery out here.

10:29.210 --> 10:32.180
Any cell service, any cell signal yet?

10:32.180 --> 10:34.080
- Nah, it doesn't really work up here.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.630
- What happened to you?

10:44.340 --> 10:47.230
I guess we'll save that for another time.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.163
Look, thanks for letting me stay.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.397
I really appreciate it.

10:51.397 --> 10:52.230
You didn't have to.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.063
- Yeah, I did.

10:53.063 --> 10:55.270
It's nice to have someone to talk to,

10:55.270 --> 10:56.470
even for a little while.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.683
But my people skills could
probably use a little work.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.273
- You're like the Tom
Cruise of cabin dwellers.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.100
- Show me the money.

11:26.723 --> 11:27.556
(Sasha knocks)

11:27.556 --> 11:28.440
Hey.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.060
- Hey.

11:30.060 --> 11:35.060
Do you mind if I clean up a little bit?

11:35.460 --> 11:36.543
- [Cole] Yeah, be my guest.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.140
- Do you mind?

11:44.140 --> 11:44.973
- Sure.

11:56.180 --> 11:58.200
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.033
- [Sasha] Night.

12:00.427 --> 12:02.060
- Night.

12:02.060 --> 12:07.060
Oh, if you need to, use
the water in the jug,

12:07.330 --> 12:08.450
and, if you have to go-

12:08.450 --> 12:10.350
- [Sasha] I'll take it outside.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.183
- Yeah.

12:13.280 --> 12:18.280
Oh, also, if you want, I
have a shirt you can use.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.820
Just throwing that out there.

12:20.820 --> 12:21.653
- Thanks.

12:27.000 --> 12:27.833
- All right.

12:30.190 --> 12:31.023
Night.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.253
- Hey, can I get that shirt?

12:42.420 --> 12:43.253
- Yeah.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.663
- I saw her photo.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.113
She was beautiful.

13:01.862 --> 13:04.362
(Sasha gasps)

13:05.715 --> 13:06.548
You scared me.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.077
I'm Sasha, what's your name?

13:10.077 --> 13:10.910
- Mya.

13:12.171 --> 13:13.004
- Hi, Mya.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.080
What are you doing here?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.457
Do you know what happened?

13:21.810 --> 13:22.773
Can you tell me?

13:28.110 --> 13:29.493
Can I trust Cole?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.765
- [Mya] Shh.

13:32.765 --> 13:34.950
(Cole knocks)

13:34.950 --> 13:39.928
- Hey, are you still up?

13:39.928 --> 13:40.883
Sorry to bother you.

13:41.965 --> 13:44.788
- [Sasha] It's all right.

13:44.788 --> 13:46.138
- I thought I heard voices.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.760
- Sometimes I talk in my sleep.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.563
- [Cole] I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were sleeping.

13:53.540 --> 13:54.590
- Oh, it's just late.

14:07.230 --> 14:08.530
- I can't sleep right now.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.013
I don't-

14:12.138 --> 14:13.888
- [Sasha] What is it?

14:17.510 --> 14:18.343
You can tell me.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.170
- I'll let you get some rest.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.695
(mysterious music)

15:13.907 --> 15:17.083
What are you doing in my house?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.860
(watch clicks)

15:19.860 --> 15:21.113
- We need to talk, Cole.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.030
- How do you know my name?

15:24.920 --> 15:26.670
- That's unimportant.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.473
Come sit down.

15:30.551 --> 15:31.601
- I'll stand, thanks.

15:32.950 --> 15:34.373
- [Mysterious Man] She's dangerous.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.880
- Sasha?
- Mm hmm.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.673
Her past is clouded in mystery.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.490
- I don't exactly have
the best past, either.

15:46.490 --> 15:49.800
- You need to get rid of
her, before it's too late.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.156
- Get rid of her?

15:51.156 --> 15:52.420
I just met her.

15:52.420 --> 15:53.290
- You know, your father once-

15:53.290 --> 15:56.803
- [Cole] Whoa, whoa, you knew my father?

15:59.900 --> 16:00.763
- [Mysterious Man] Yes.

16:02.372 --> 16:04.277
But don't trouble yourself
about that right now.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.793
- Do you know where everyone's gone?

16:11.674 --> 16:15.341
(shimmering, pulsing music)

16:36.950 --> 16:38.710
- You've been dealt a particularly unique

16:38.710 --> 16:40.053
hand of cards, my friend.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.600
There's nothing I can say to give you

16:42.600 --> 16:45.653
a satisfactory explanation
for what you're going through.

16:48.081 --> 16:49.310
- I just want answers.

16:49.310 --> 16:51.263
- You're gonna have to
figure it out on your own,

16:52.925 --> 16:54.133
and you don't have much time.

16:56.690 --> 16:57.553
- Time for what?

16:59.629 --> 17:01.340
- If you don't get rid of her soon,

17:01.340 --> 17:04.093
everything you know is in
danger of becoming extinct.

17:06.530 --> 17:07.829
- How much time do I have?

17:10.410 --> 17:11.933
- A week, maybe less.

17:13.237 --> 17:15.819
(watch clicks)

17:17.660 --> 17:18.492
- [Cole] Hey.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.690
What's your name?

17:22.690 --> 17:25.063
- It's Flynn, but that's not important.

17:28.610 --> 17:29.813
Clock's ticking, Cole.

17:55.989 --> 17:59.220
- Hey, about last-
- Look, I'm-

17:59.220 --> 18:00.053
- Go ahead.

18:02.150 --> 18:02.983
- It's okay.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.100
- Everything's a little off.

18:14.188 --> 18:17.049
I really don't know what's
going on around here.

18:17.049 --> 18:18.137
- You're not the only one.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.200
- See, that's just it.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.630
- What do you mean?

18:27.120 --> 18:30.130
- Do you really think
we're the only ones left?

18:30.130 --> 18:31.690
- I don't know.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.710
I mean, if so, why us?

18:37.865 --> 18:39.115
- I don't know.

18:40.993 --> 18:45.493
I don't think I'd be very
good for starting over with.

18:46.621 --> 18:47.980
- I'm not perfect, either.

18:49.455 --> 18:51.128
- You seem all right to me.

18:51.128 --> 18:52.170
I mean, you're female.

18:52.170 --> 18:55.190
(Sasha snorts)

18:55.190 --> 18:57.723
- I'm no Eve, but I can give it a shot.

18:59.450 --> 19:01.790
She is the one that tempted Adam.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.290
- You planning on tempting me?

19:04.820 --> 19:06.683
- Got any forbidden fruit laying around?

19:12.982 --> 19:15.482
(Sasha sighs)

19:20.865 --> 19:21.865
- I'm sorry.

19:23.132 --> 19:24.370
- What do you mean?

19:24.370 --> 19:26.140
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.677
I'm on my way inside, on my own.

19:30.471 --> 19:32.510
I know it's a little lame,
but if you'd like to-

19:32.510 --> 19:33.343
- [Sasha] Sure.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.310
- Sure what?

19:35.310 --> 19:36.700
- I'll join you.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.260
- Really?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.540
- I'm here, you're here.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.690
Might as well make the most of it.

19:41.690 --> 19:42.523
- Okay.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.123
- I'm Sasha.
- Blake.

19:56.450 --> 19:57.710
What happened back there?

19:59.520 --> 20:00.353
- Asshole.

20:02.390 --> 20:05.553
- Listen, as guys,
we're wired to be dicks.

20:06.650 --> 20:10.050
It's only through proper
training and conditioning

20:10.930 --> 20:13.625
that we can treat women with respect.

20:13.625 --> 20:16.540
- (chuckles) Is that so?

20:16.540 --> 20:17.373
- Yeah.

20:19.971 --> 20:20.804
Yeah.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.660
- I thought we really had something.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.460
- She was your cousin.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.320
- But we really connected.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.230
- Blood is thicker than water, boys.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.160
At least, that's what they say.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.600
Hit me.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.860
- Saddle up, little doggies,

20:34.860 --> 20:37.481
we's going out on the
open prairie tonight.

20:37.481 --> 20:38.314
(actress laughs)

20:38.314 --> 20:40.180
- How about you, Chuck,
how's your love life?

20:40.180 --> 20:41.970
- Eh, you know, I do all right.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.160
- All right, huh?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.750
- He's dating my best friend Kate.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.770
- When did this happen?
- You knew?

20:46.770 --> 20:48.820
- We're friends, doofus, and we're girls.

20:48.820 --> 20:50.147
We talk.

20:50.147 --> 20:51.090
- You talk, do you, is that what you do?

20:51.090 --> 20:52.310
And what do you talk about,

20:52.310 --> 20:54.543
other than my scorching good looks.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.170
- Just girl stuff.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.350
- Beer, boobs, and football?

20:59.350 --> 21:00.800
- You guessed it, Mikey.
- Whose boobs?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.780
- Can we please stay
on the matter at hand?

21:02.780 --> 21:03.770
- And what matter is that?

21:03.770 --> 21:04.780
- Kate!

21:04.780 --> 21:05.950
What did she say about me?

21:05.950 --> 21:06.783
- Hit me.

21:23.444 --> 21:24.444
- Oh, did I?

21:26.908 --> 21:28.158
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

21:29.042 --> 21:29.875
- [Sasha] It's all right.

21:29.875 --> 21:30.710
Let's get outta here.

21:31.579 --> 21:32.412
- Yeah.

21:40.335 --> 21:43.252
(screeching tones)

21:51.340 --> 21:54.923
(echoing, distorted voice)

21:58.937 --> 22:00.690
- [Radio Voice] If anyone
can hear this message,

22:00.690 --> 22:04.582
you are (speaker collapses
into distortion).

22:04.582 --> 22:06.201
If anyone can hear this message,

22:06.201 --> 22:11.201
you are not alone (speaker
collapses into distortion).

22:37.518 --> 22:40.018
(Sasha sighs)

22:40.951 --> 22:43.151
(Sasha gasps)

22:43.151 --> 22:44.530
- Why do you keep doing that?

22:44.530 --> 22:46.113
- You startle easily.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.013
- You knew this was the end
of the world, didn't you?

22:57.540 --> 22:58.690
Why didn't you tell me?

23:01.820 --> 23:03.283
- [Mya] Look, we need to go.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.303
- Where?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.363
Cole's the only one around.

23:11.630 --> 23:14.080
Don't you think it's better
if we stick together?

23:18.149 --> 23:20.649
(Sasha sighs)

23:33.827 --> 23:36.244
(Cole sighs)

23:42.980 --> 23:44.180
- Glad to have you back.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.080
- I'm sorry about last night.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.190
- You're free to leave whenever you want.

23:50.190 --> 23:51.353
It's not a prison here.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.873
- I know, it's-
- It's fine.

23:56.740 --> 23:59.690
- It's not like me to just take
off without saying goodbye.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.860
- So, is that was this is?

24:06.050 --> 24:08.100
Maybe we should go our own separate ways,

24:09.330 --> 24:10.280
for a little while.

24:15.439 --> 24:17.500
- What are you doing?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.293
- Losing what's left of my sanity.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.810
- Why do you have all these?

24:27.630 --> 24:28.780
You're not one of those

24:28.780 --> 24:31.433
end of the world type creeps, are you?

24:33.110 --> 24:36.590
- No, actually, I haven't
even read half of these books.

24:36.590 --> 24:38.270
Besides, I don't even own a bomb shelter.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.730
I'm pretty sure that's a requirement.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.963
- Yeah. (chuckles)

24:45.840 --> 24:47.790
- I'll let you know if I find anything.

24:52.265 --> 24:54.932
(water gurgles)

25:05.289 --> 25:07.872
(woman grunts)

25:13.643 --> 25:16.310
(static hisses)

25:25.730 --> 25:28.010
(Cole sighs)

25:28.010 --> 25:29.690
- You're pathetic.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.483
You've really let yourself go.

25:32.609 --> 25:35.550
You're (stutters) pathetic.

25:35.550 --> 25:38.903
You have really let
yourself (stutters) go.

25:40.963 --> 25:41.796
- Mom?

25:42.770 --> 25:44.720
- Don't give me that!

25:44.720 --> 25:47.060
Is this how you wanna spend
the rest of your life,

25:47.060 --> 25:48.243
or what's left of it?

25:51.520 --> 25:54.400
- I don't know what to do.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.700
Things haven't been the same since-

25:56.700 --> 25:58.786
- So you decided to just waste away.

25:58.786 --> 25:59.950
- Well, I don't even
know if there's a world

25:59.950 --> 26:01.983
for me to be part of anymore.

26:01.983 --> 26:03.210
- God!
- I mean, for all I know,

26:03.210 --> 26:04.750
I'm the last man on earth.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.730
- Oh, well, what about
that (stutters) girl

26:06.730 --> 26:08.190
you've been spending so much time with?

26:08.190 --> 26:09.023
- Sasha.

26:09.023 --> 26:10.240
- Tramp.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.230
- She's not a tramp, she's
just as confused as I am.

26:13.230 --> 26:16.440
- No one will ever be as confused as you.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.133
- I devoted my life to you!

26:19.241 --> 26:22.503
- (stutters) Whatever
helps you sleep at night.

26:23.970 --> 26:26.498
- This is the end of the world, and you.

26:26.498 --> 26:29.586
(static hisses)

26:29.586 --> 26:30.442
You're dead.

26:30.442 --> 26:33.109
(static hisses)

26:49.186 --> 26:51.436
What the hell am I missing?

27:16.088 --> 27:16.921
Candace?

27:45.871 --> 27:48.204
Did you do what you need to?

27:49.452 --> 27:50.285
- Yeah.

27:54.913 --> 27:57.273
What if we are the last people on Earth?

28:01.344 --> 28:02.594
- I don't know.

28:04.870 --> 28:05.703
Repopulate?

28:08.460 --> 28:09.993
- You would like that, wouldn't you?

28:14.230 --> 28:17.140
You are totally into me, aren't you?

28:17.140 --> 28:18.580
- I've seen better.

28:18.580 --> 28:19.813
- Oh, better, huh?

28:21.150 --> 28:22.850
Do you see any better around here?

28:24.698 --> 28:26.398
- I don't see anybody around here.

28:27.329 --> 28:28.603
- [Sasha] That's what I thought.

28:32.610 --> 28:33.610
- So where'd you go?

28:38.190 --> 28:40.240
It's all right, you don't have to say it.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.363
- It's just things have
been so strange lately.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.980
- You mean besides the apocalypse?

28:52.310 --> 28:53.410
There's been a lot of other weird stuff

28:53.410 --> 28:54.460
going on around here.

28:56.114 --> 28:57.781
- [Sasha] Weird how?

28:59.275 --> 29:02.942
- Well, I had an argument
with my dead wife,

29:03.890 --> 29:06.900
and I also had a
conversation with my mother,

29:06.900 --> 29:07.923
who is also dead.

29:09.270 --> 29:10.103
- Really.

29:11.090 --> 29:13.040
- I've also been seeing this guy Flynn.

29:15.550 --> 29:16.383
- Who's he?

29:21.770 --> 29:22.763
- [Cole] What is it?

29:24.180 --> 29:25.013
- Nothing.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.560
- Please, tell me I'm not going crazy.

29:32.430 --> 29:35.783
- Better prep the padded
room, reservation for two.

29:40.372 --> 29:41.205
- Come on.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.430
- No offense, but those clothes

29:55.430 --> 29:57.180
look like they've seen better days.

30:00.780 --> 30:02.340
- They're all I have.

30:02.340 --> 30:05.160
- Still have some of my
wife's clothes in the closet.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.600
- [Sasha] Oh, you don't have to.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.433
- It's okay.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.430
She has no need for them anymore,

30:10.430 --> 30:12.763
so you're welcome to help yourself.

30:15.910 --> 30:16.743
- Thank you.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.537
What do you think?

30:31.379 --> 30:33.020
- You look good.

30:33.020 --> 30:34.170
- [Sasha] Yeah, I know.

30:43.047 --> 30:45.640
- I'm glad you decided to come back.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.473
- Yeah, me, too.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.570
I know it's none of my business,

30:55.570 --> 31:00.270
but why haven't you, you
know, gotten back out there?

31:08.680 --> 31:12.610
- When you meet someone
who just really takes

31:12.610 --> 31:13.473
your breath away.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.943
- Well, what happened, if
you don't mind me asking?

31:22.340 --> 31:24.673
- She was out collecting
water from the creek,

31:26.350 --> 31:27.850
the way she did every morning.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.563
She loves being outdoors.

31:35.808 --> 31:36.770
(woman grunts)

31:36.770 --> 31:39.793
Something just felt wrong.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.280
So I went out to go check on her.

31:44.646 --> 31:47.146
(quiet music)

31:56.787 --> 31:59.204
(Cole weeps)

32:07.970 --> 32:09.053
- I'm so sorry.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.990
- Her ring was laying nearby.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.070
- It's all right.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.623
I'm here, love.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.713
What is it?

32:26.580 --> 32:29.127
- Nothing, it's just
something she used to say.

32:30.788 --> 32:31.621
- Oh.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.063
- What is this?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.911
- Hey, what's that?

32:44.950 --> 32:46.893
- Looks like she was writing a book.

32:48.180 --> 32:49.670
- You should probably respect her privacy.

32:49.670 --> 32:50.923
- I have to read that.

32:53.660 --> 32:56.600
- She wouldn't want you
thumbing through her things.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.380
- Well, why wouldn't she tell me about it?

32:58.380 --> 33:00.250
- Everybody has secrets, Cole.

33:00.250 --> 33:02.043
Some things are better left alone.

33:10.275 --> 33:13.192
(shimmering music)

33:19.117 --> 33:20.360
- [Flynn] What did I
tell you about the girl?

33:20.360 --> 33:21.253
- Jeez.

33:22.617 --> 33:23.910
- [Flynn] Well?

33:23.910 --> 33:25.130
- Yeah, I know what you said,

33:25.130 --> 33:27.000
it's just-
- You like her.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.760
- There might be something to her.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.260
- Yeah.

33:34.260 --> 33:37.943
She's gorgeous, possibly the
last woman on the planet,

33:39.158 --> 33:40.325
and, you know.

33:42.831 --> 33:43.664
- And what?

33:43.664 --> 33:45.263
- And she reminds you of?

33:48.340 --> 33:49.520
- No.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.120
- [Flynn] You miss her?

33:51.120 --> 33:54.310
- Of course I miss her,
but Sasha's not even-

33:54.310 --> 33:56.880
- There's things you
still don't understand.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.030
- There's a hell of a
lot I don't understand.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.980
Women are just one of those things.

34:00.980 --> 34:04.420
- Cole, there's forces
working against you.

34:04.420 --> 34:07.330
- Why are you even here.

34:07.330 --> 34:08.960
There's no way that you can be real.

34:08.960 --> 34:09.862
- What's reality?

34:11.340 --> 34:13.290
- [Cole] Why are we talking philosophy?

34:14.409 --> 34:17.103
- If your brain thinks
something is real, it's real.

34:18.053 --> 34:20.389
(Cole sighs)

34:20.389 --> 34:23.040
- My brain tells me there
is no way that you're real.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.889
But here we are, carrying on

34:25.889 --> 34:27.889
like two characters in a bad soap opera.

34:30.730 --> 34:31.730
Are you real or not?

34:33.460 --> 34:34.306
- You decide.

34:35.409 --> 34:38.327
(fluttering music)

34:40.429 --> 34:41.263
- Flynn?

34:45.245 --> 34:46.078
Flynn?

34:48.926 --> 34:51.342
(Cole sighs)

34:57.460 --> 34:59.040
- My God, are you okay?

34:59.040 --> 34:59.990
- [Cole] I'll live.

35:01.150 --> 35:02.483
- What happened?

35:05.754 --> 35:08.054
- I thought I saw my
wife's ring in the creek.

35:09.033 --> 35:10.228
- So you dove in?

35:10.228 --> 35:12.145
- [Cole] No, I slipped.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.659
- Let's get you cleaned up.

35:14.659 --> 35:15.905
Let's get a shower.

35:15.905 --> 35:19.322
(gentle, haunting music)

36:24.423 --> 36:26.150
That's a new look.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.700
- Well, it's time for a change.

36:34.310 --> 36:36.047
What are we gonna do
with the rest of our day?

36:38.569 --> 36:39.969
- We could just stay in bed.

36:41.870 --> 36:44.040
- [Cole] You're something
else, you know that?

36:44.040 --> 36:44.873
- Oh, I know.

36:49.663 --> 36:50.713
(gasps) Blake!

36:52.372 --> 36:53.930
- What's wrong, baby?

36:53.930 --> 36:56.170
- What are you doing here?

36:56.170 --> 36:58.270
- Rocking your world, if I'm not mistaken.

37:01.030 --> 37:02.780
What are you doing with this loser?

37:03.910 --> 37:04.743
- [Sasha] Cole?

37:05.802 --> 37:07.553
- How many guys are you sleeping with?

37:10.940 --> 37:14.295
You know, I never would've
pegged you for a cheater.

37:14.295 --> 37:15.760
- That's not fair!
- No, what's not fair

37:15.760 --> 37:17.660
is you don't whether or
not I'm dead or alive,

37:17.660 --> 37:19.690
and, yet, here you are banging this idiot.

37:19.690 --> 37:21.200
- You disappeared!

37:21.200 --> 37:22.033
- How do you know I just didn't go

37:22.033 --> 37:24.150
down to the pub, get shit-faced,

37:24.150 --> 37:26.364
and end up in the gutter
for a couple of days?

37:26.364 --> 37:28.401
- I don't know what you want me to say.

37:28.401 --> 37:29.560
- No, you know what?

37:29.560 --> 37:30.560
I see where I stand.

37:31.590 --> 37:32.913
- Wait, Blake!

37:38.879 --> 37:40.879
- Did you say something?

37:42.127 --> 37:43.577
- No, I was talking out loud.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.493
- Okay.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.983
Wanna try heading out to the pub?

37:53.060 --> 37:54.310
- Yeah, I'll get dressed.

37:59.464 --> 38:00.464
- All right.

38:02.980 --> 38:06.160
- You think we're gonna
find anything in there?

38:08.575 --> 38:10.075
It's worth a shot.

38:11.354 --> 38:13.096
- At the very least,
we can get some drinks.

38:13.096 --> 38:14.429
- Oh, hell yeah.

38:24.088 --> 38:26.525
- Are you good at pool?

38:26.525 --> 38:28.358
- I can kick your ass.

38:29.820 --> 38:30.720
- I need to hit the head.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.387
Where do you think the bathroom's at?

38:33.387 --> 38:35.100
Follow the signs, okay.

38:35.100 --> 38:37.850
(Sasha chuckles)

38:39.563 --> 38:41.280
Oh, here we go.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.977
I'll go this way, and you go that way.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.873
(urine splatters)

39:07.342 --> 39:12.342
(bluesy rock music)
(people chattering)

39:21.773 --> 39:23.440
Are you seeing this?

39:25.064 --> 39:25.897
- Uh huh.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.193
I was not expecting people.

39:36.828 --> 39:38.078
- Let's mingle.

39:42.169 --> 39:44.669
(balls clack)

39:45.800 --> 39:48.667
- Hey, bud.

39:48.667 --> 39:49.599
- Me?

39:49.599 --> 39:50.651
- [Blake] Come here.

39:50.651 --> 39:53.651
(bluesy rock music)

39:56.349 --> 39:57.182
- Thanks.

40:01.324 --> 40:02.737
Do I know you?

40:02.737 --> 40:05.250
- Nah, man, you don't know me,

40:05.250 --> 40:06.300
but maybe you should.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.273
- Okay.

40:11.940 --> 40:12.773
- Drink up.

40:14.530 --> 40:15.453
But I know you.

40:16.610 --> 40:17.910
You're the apocalypse guy.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.330
- So you're not real, either?

40:23.340 --> 40:25.220
- Perception is reality.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.190
Everyone knows that.

40:27.190 --> 40:29.040
- [Cole] Okay, are you the Riddler or?

40:29.040 --> 40:31.493
- No, man, no, I'm not the Riddler.

40:32.634 --> 40:33.467
I'm Blake.

40:34.586 --> 40:36.150
- Hi, Blake.

40:36.150 --> 40:37.143
- Sasha's Blake.

40:38.460 --> 40:39.293
- Oh.

40:42.010 --> 40:43.510
Well, hey, she's around here.

40:43.510 --> 40:44.650
I'm sure she'd be really happy-

40:44.650 --> 40:46.820
- It's not her I'm interested in.

40:49.193 --> 40:50.026
- Oh.

40:51.485 --> 40:53.318
What can I do for you?

40:55.575 --> 40:57.535
- You can stay the hell away from my girl.

40:57.535 --> 40:59.200
- Look, I didn't know that she was-

40:59.200 --> 41:00.300
- I know what you did.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.750
- Okay.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.883
No offense, but as far as I can tell,

41:07.430 --> 41:10.263
she's the only one who's
real in here, besides me.

41:14.635 --> 41:15.770
Thanks for the drink.

41:15.770 --> 41:16.603
- Keep it real.

41:17.730 --> 41:22.730
(people chattering)
(bluesy rock music)

41:29.914 --> 41:31.736
- What did I tell you about the girl?

41:31.736 --> 41:34.488
- I know, I know.

41:34.488 --> 41:36.405
- You're not listening.

41:38.531 --> 41:39.366
She's coming.

41:39.366 --> 41:42.533
(pounding rock music)

41:43.665 --> 41:46.147
- Who's your friend?

41:46.147 --> 41:47.589
I'm Sasha.

41:47.589 --> 41:50.756
(pounding rock music)

42:04.810 --> 42:08.352
What the hell is his problem?

42:08.352 --> 42:09.185
- He's a comic.

42:09.185 --> 42:12.352
(pounding rock music)

42:13.737 --> 42:16.654
Find anyone interesting to talk to?

42:18.573 --> 42:20.353
- Just one of my imaginary friends.

42:20.353 --> 42:23.520
(pounding rock music)

42:26.131 --> 42:29.376
- We should probably head back.

42:29.376 --> 42:32.503
- Cole, we might not get
another chance like this.

42:32.503 --> 42:35.103
(pounding rock music)

42:35.103 --> 42:36.092
- Let's go.

42:36.092 --> 42:39.259
(pounding rock music)

42:41.481 --> 42:42.314
- Blake!

42:44.057 --> 42:46.640
(Cole retches)

42:53.230 --> 42:55.730
(quiet music)

43:15.155 --> 43:16.405
How ya feeling?

43:17.587 --> 43:18.683
- How do I look?

43:19.870 --> 43:20.870
- [Sasha] Like shit.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.737
I talked to him, you know.

43:32.737 --> 43:34.543
- And you didn't say anything?

43:35.450 --> 43:40.200
- I didn't know who he was, at first.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.780
(Sasha sighs)

43:41.780 --> 43:43.023
He's not real, you know.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.563
- How do we even know what's real anymore?

43:51.420 --> 43:54.150
- What if they're just
distracting us from-

43:54.150 --> 43:56.400
- What, from what we're
supposed to be doing?

43:58.180 --> 43:59.013
- Yeah

43:59.013 --> 44:00.423
- What are we supposed to be doing?

44:07.570 --> 44:08.770
- I'm reading that book.

44:11.650 --> 44:12.680
- What book?

44:12.680 --> 44:13.880
- [Cole] Candace's book.

44:23.154 --> 44:24.090
- What do you think you're doing?

44:24.090 --> 44:25.620
- Trying to find out
what's so damn important

44:25.620 --> 44:27.420
she didn't want me to know about it.

44:37.388 --> 44:38.477
"They lived in a quaint cabin in the woods

44:38.477 --> 44:40.994
"outside a small Colorado town.

44:40.994 --> 44:42.967
"A soft flowing creek ran
behind their loving home,

44:42.967 --> 44:44.367
"and provided the perfect backdrop

44:44.367 --> 44:45.837
"for what they hoped would one day be home

44:45.837 --> 44:47.307
"to their future children."

44:51.520 --> 44:52.370
Is this about us?

44:59.367 --> 45:00.563
"Sasha knew."

45:01.650 --> 45:02.483
Sasha?

45:04.157 --> 45:06.637
"Sasha knew she could never
tell him what happened.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.097
"He would be crushed.

45:08.097 --> 45:09.517
"Blake had always wanted a child,

45:09.517 --> 45:11.217
"and the loss would devastate him.

45:14.147 --> 45:16.217
"Several years passed,
but she never told him

45:16.217 --> 45:17.853
"about the miscarriage.

45:19.117 --> 45:21.227
"Their love had been the
one constant in their lives,

45:21.227 --> 45:24.397
"and she didn't wanna do
anything to put that in jeopardy.

45:24.397 --> 45:26.617
"Maybe one day they would
know the love of a child,

45:26.617 --> 45:29.837
"but Mya, she was her secret."

45:37.436 --> 45:39.329
(book bangs)

45:39.329 --> 45:40.429
What the hell is this?

45:42.024 --> 45:43.670
- [Sasha] (sighs) I
told you not to read it.

45:43.670 --> 45:45.303
- Why are you in this book?

45:46.406 --> 45:48.569
(Sasha sighs)

45:48.569 --> 45:50.183
- We knew you wouldn't understand.

45:52.040 --> 45:52.873
- We?

45:54.270 --> 45:55.140
- I'm leaving.

45:55.140 --> 45:57.900
I can't stand to watch this
train wreck any longer.

45:57.900 --> 45:58.733
- Wait, Sasha!

46:00.400 --> 46:01.810
Sasha!

46:01.810 --> 46:03.883
Sasha, where are you going?

46:06.270 --> 46:07.733
- I shouldn't have come back.

46:09.570 --> 46:10.653
Just leave me alone.

46:41.070 --> 46:41.903
- Dad?

46:47.960 --> 46:49.160
What are you doing here?

46:50.280 --> 46:51.113
- You need to quit worrying

46:51.113 --> 46:52.680
about what other people are doing,

46:52.680 --> 46:54.773
and start thinking about
what you need to do.

46:55.890 --> 46:57.470
- [Cole] Which is what?

46:57.470 --> 46:59.240
- It's time for you to make a choice.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.100
- What choice?

47:01.100 --> 47:01.933
Dad.

47:02.989 --> 47:05.739
(dramatic music)

47:16.060 --> 47:17.114
Are you Mya?

47:17.114 --> 47:19.864
(dramatic music)

47:37.250 --> 47:38.403
My father blamed me.

47:40.355 --> 47:43.236
He climbed into a bottle,
and he never looked back.

47:43.236 --> 47:45.986
(dramatic music)

47:56.581 --> 47:58.998
(lush music)

48:47.629 --> 48:49.060
What do you want?

48:49.060 --> 48:50.290
Hey!

48:50.290 --> 48:51.373
- Get over yourself.

48:53.187 --> 48:54.830
- [Cole] Can I help you?

48:54.830 --> 48:56.610
Just here to go through all my shit?

48:56.610 --> 48:57.800
- I'm here on business.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.083
- [Cole] Well, I'm not buying.

49:00.060 --> 49:01.160
- I want my life back.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.523
You're obviously confused, Cole, as usual.

49:08.470 --> 49:09.660
- Why are you even here?

49:09.660 --> 49:12.071
Do you wanna borrow
some sugar or something?

49:12.071 --> 49:14.313
- (chuckles) You're funny.

49:15.150 --> 49:17.023
Sugar, nah, not sugar.

49:18.490 --> 49:19.323
Blood, maybe.

49:20.450 --> 49:21.343
Maybe pain.

49:23.270 --> 49:24.923
- [Cole] What are you talking about?

49:26.794 --> 49:28.838
- Was I rambling again?

49:28.838 --> 49:30.500
Maybe there's something in the water.

49:30.500 --> 49:31.833
- Get to the point!

49:33.020 --> 49:35.400
- Take it easy, I come in peace.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.700
- Why don't I believe you?

49:37.960 --> 49:39.433
- 'Cause I'm obviously lying.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.063
We're all lying, Cole.

49:44.185 --> 49:45.873
You're just too dumb to figure it out.

49:45.873 --> 49:46.771
- [Cole] Then why don't you tell me

49:46.771 --> 49:48.140
what the hell is going on?

49:48.140 --> 49:50.563
- The answers will come, in time.

49:51.450 --> 49:55.283
And Sasha, she'll come back to you.

49:55.283 --> 49:56.580
- I thought she was your girl.

49:56.580 --> 49:57.780
- [Blake] Things change.

49:59.620 --> 50:02.040
- Look, man, I didn't mean to.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.340
- Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

50:04.650 --> 50:07.533
I'm not here for excuses or apologies.

50:08.490 --> 50:10.585
- [Cole] Then what the hell do you want?

50:10.585 --> 50:13.085
(fist smacks)

50:16.280 --> 50:18.130
- Don't make the same mistakes I did.

51:02.765 --> 51:06.098
(tense, exciting music)

51:43.307 --> 51:44.943
- What in the hell is
going on around here?

51:46.330 --> 51:47.780
- Let's go stretch your legs.

51:54.858 --> 51:55.783
- [Cole] I saw my mom.

51:57.290 --> 51:58.440
- [Flynn] She's around.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.050
- I had a daughter.

52:03.050 --> 52:05.003
I've been feeling terrible.

52:06.840 --> 52:09.790
- Well, that's to be expected.

52:09.790 --> 52:10.980
- Really?

52:10.980 --> 52:13.163
- Look, I'm not here to
answer your questions.

52:15.024 --> 52:17.050
- Then why are you here?

52:17.050 --> 52:18.313
- That's not important.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.733
What is important is this.

52:22.594 --> 52:23.540
- [Cole] What do you know about this?

52:23.540 --> 52:25.560
- There's nothing but trouble in there.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.110
You best get rid of it now
while you still have a chance.

52:28.110 --> 52:29.330
- [Cole] I had a daughter.

52:29.330 --> 52:31.680
- Heed my warning, son.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.290
That book is dangerous.

52:33.290 --> 52:35.370
It'll only hold you back,

52:35.370 --> 52:36.920
and you're running out of time.

52:39.130 --> 52:41.100
I'm afraid this is farewell.

52:41.100 --> 52:43.727
Good luck, I'll be rooting for you.

52:56.580 --> 52:57.413
- What now?

52:59.410 --> 53:01.051
The hell's your problem?

53:01.051 --> 53:02.710
- You know what they
say, if I can't have her.

53:02.710 --> 53:03.610
- You're not real.

53:04.730 --> 53:06.367
- [Blake] That real enough for you?

53:06.367 --> 53:07.804
(Cole groans)

53:07.804 --> 53:08.637
There ain't room enough in the world

53:08.637 --> 53:09.680
for the both of us, friend.

53:10.559 --> 53:12.080
- What the hell do you want?

53:12.080 --> 53:14.942
- Face it, Cole, you're all alone.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.442
(Cole grunts)

53:23.130 --> 53:24.843
- Still reading those books?

53:25.810 --> 53:27.653
- They're actually pretty fascinating.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.020
- This laundry is fascinating.

53:32.290 --> 53:33.200
- You know, one day, we'll have some kids,

53:33.200 --> 53:35.400
and then we can make
them do all the chores.

53:37.010 --> 53:38.710
- Is that why you wanna have kids?

53:41.620 --> 53:43.570
- I wanna have kids because I love you,

53:44.720 --> 53:47.533
and I want some little rascals
to share that love with.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.720
- [Candace] Good answer.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.820
- What do you say we start trying?

53:52.820 --> 53:53.653
- Now?

53:54.712 --> 53:56.040
What about the laundry?

53:56.040 --> 53:56.873
- It can wait.

54:15.090 --> 54:17.940
I used to think about what I
would do if I ever lost you.

54:23.142 --> 54:25.920
I'm talking to people that can't be real,

54:25.920 --> 54:27.683
sleeping with women who aren't you.

54:31.232 --> 54:32.903
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

54:35.490 --> 54:36.740
But I gotta do something.

54:42.757 --> 54:45.424
(Cole sniffles)

54:47.907 --> 54:49.587
"Blake leaned over to Sasha and whispered

54:49.587 --> 54:50.927
"sweetly into her ear."

54:52.630 --> 54:54.630
What the hell are you trying to tell me?

54:56.110 --> 54:56.943
You're not real.

54:58.669 --> 55:00.330
- [Blake] Don't you see, farm boy?

55:00.330 --> 55:01.520
- See what?

55:01.520 --> 55:03.943
- You'll never defeat
me 'cause you are me.

55:06.806 --> 55:09.139
(men grunt)

55:17.562 --> 55:20.562
- No, no, come on, come on, come on.

55:23.358 --> 55:26.276
(Cole weeps)

55:26.276 --> 55:28.206
You're all I have left.

55:28.206 --> 55:30.623
(Cole pants)

55:42.460 --> 55:43.293
Candace?

55:48.850 --> 55:49.800
I don't understand.

55:51.620 --> 55:52.670
- Come with me, Cole.

55:55.557 --> 55:58.140
(gentle music)

56:02.380 --> 56:03.330
- What's happening?

56:04.500 --> 56:06.150
- There's something in the water.

56:07.580 --> 56:08.530
- What do you mean?

56:10.610 --> 56:11.660
- It's affecting you.

56:16.727 --> 56:18.894
You have to make a choice.

56:22.310 --> 56:23.343
- You or Sasha.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.063
- No, the truth or.

56:29.090 --> 56:29.923
- The lie.

56:37.750 --> 56:38.960
I'm having such a good time with you,

56:38.960 --> 56:40.210
but I know it's not real.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.283
Am I the last man on Earth?

56:49.030 --> 56:50.943
- [Candace] Is that
what's important to you?

56:57.637 --> 57:01.773
- What about Sasha, the book?

57:03.560 --> 57:08.003
- It was too personal
to use our real names.

57:11.500 --> 57:12.450
- Blake said...

57:17.530 --> 57:18.363
Theater.

57:38.910 --> 57:39.743
I'm sorry.

57:41.925 --> 57:43.540
- What do you mean?

57:43.540 --> 57:45.583
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.363
I'm on my way in, all by myself.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.250
I know it's kinda lame,
but I was wondering-

58:00.250 --> 58:01.083
- Sure.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.610
- Sure what?

58:04.610 --> 58:05.783
- [Candace] I'll join you.

58:07.090 --> 58:07.923
- Really?

58:10.160 --> 58:11.410
- [Candace] I'm here, you're here,

58:11.410 --> 58:13.110
might as well make the most of it.

58:14.140 --> 58:15.376
- Okay.

58:15.376 --> 58:17.876
(quiet music)

58:30.290 --> 58:31.940
That was the best day of my life.

58:32.880 --> 58:33.713
- Mine, too.

58:37.053 --> 58:39.257
- What about Flynn?

58:39.257 --> 58:41.567
- You don't remember?

58:41.567 --> 58:44.817
(gentle, solemn music)

58:54.991 --> 58:55.824
Cole?

59:02.577 --> 59:04.577
- [Cole] Can I help you?

59:05.705 --> 59:07.372
- Boy, you've grown.

59:08.414 --> 59:09.764
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

59:11.780 --> 59:14.730
- Last time I saw you, you were
knee-high to a grasshopper.

59:16.440 --> 59:19.420
My name's Flynn, but that's not important.

59:20.700 --> 59:22.450
I'm an old friend of your father's.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.380
- My father doesn't live here.

59:25.380 --> 59:26.213
- Yeah.

59:30.110 --> 59:31.620
Look, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

59:31.620 --> 59:33.233
but your dad passed away.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.513
I know you weren't close.

59:46.580 --> 59:47.980
- Do you know what happened?

59:52.820 --> 59:53.720
- He was drinking,

59:56.410 --> 59:58.023
like he often did, you know.

1:00:00.875 --> 1:00:03.390
(gun clicks)

1:00:03.390 --> 1:00:06.140
(father panting)

1:00:09.269 --> 1:00:11.602
(gun bangs)

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:19.953
Well, I'm sorry you
had to hear it from me.

1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:25.640
I'll be on my way.

1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.400
- Hey, thanks for letting me know.

1:00:36.010 --> 1:00:36.910
- No problem, kid.

1:00:38.310 --> 1:00:39.600
See you around.

1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:57.973
- That was a hard day.

1:01:00.910 --> 1:01:01.743
- Yeah.

1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:07.950
Why are all these visions, these people,

1:01:07.950 --> 1:01:12.950
trying to keep Sasha, us, us,

1:01:14.870 --> 1:01:16.720
why are they trying to keep us apart?

1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:21.200
- Part of you would want to keep

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:22.793
the illusion alive forever,

1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:26.550
but your body can't take
much more of the poison.

1:01:27.594 --> 1:01:30.094
(Cole coughs)

1:01:39.189 --> 1:01:40.023
- I'm not ready.

1:01:40.023 --> 1:01:42.856
(emotional music)

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:56.245
I still have so much...

1:01:56.245 --> 1:01:59.078
(emotional music)

1:02:08.679 --> 1:02:09.981
I still have so much.

1:02:09.981 --> 1:02:12.814
(emotional music)

1:03:12.965 --> 1:03:15.548
(Cole retches)

1:03:17.905 --> 1:03:20.738
(emotional music)

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:43.360
- [Man Voiceover] This is Gunter Harrison.

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:45.239
We have regained radio signal.

1:04:45.239 --> 1:04:47.590
I repeat, we are back on the air.

1:04:47.590 --> 1:04:51.030
If anyone can hear this
message, you are not alone.

1:04:51.030 --> 1:04:52.715
There are others.

1:04:52.715 --> 1:04:55.847
We are gathering in the
small town of Black Hawk.

1:04:55.847 --> 1:04:57.950
We have food and fresh water.

1:04:57.950 --> 1:05:00.240
I urge you to leave the
comfort of your homes,

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.811
make your way to Black
Hawk as quickly as you can,

1:05:02.811 --> 1:05:06.613
and, whatever you do, do
not trust the strangers.

1:05:06.613 --> 1:05:09.696
I repeat, do not trust the strangers.

1:05:10.546 --> 1:05:14.129
(haunting, ethereal music)
