WEBVTT

00:03.510 --> 00:06.840
Oh, I am so sorry, ladies. It's too late, but don't hate.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.720
Ollie's already got a prom date!

00:11.650 --> 00:14.450
Oh and... you can have your eggs and you can have your bacon,

00:14.450 --> 00:17.200
but argh... you can't have Lily 'cause she is taken!

00:17.240 --> 00:18.370
Oh, did you see that!

00:19.580 --> 00:20.430
See ya.

00:20.630 --> 00:23.290
-You are just so adorable!  -You are!

00:23.330 --> 00:24.110
Let's go to prom together!

00:24.180 --> 00:25.350
-OK.  -Alright!

00:25.730 --> 00:28.660
You know it's so great not having to sit around praying

00:28.660 --> 00:30.670
that the one guy you really want to go with will ask you.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.940
That feeling of being so desperate, so needy, so...

00:35.000 --> 00:39.240
Ask me. Ask me. Ask me. Ask me!

00:39.240 --> 00:39.980
So that.

00:40.850 --> 00:41.930
Cheap shot.

00:42.020 --> 00:45.080
Ask me. Ask me. Ask me NOW!

00:45.540 --> 00:48.240
You ask me ask me NOW!

00:49.300 --> 00:50.740
Is it what you used on me?

00:51.740 --> 00:53.150
Yeah. You bet...

00:55.350 --> 00:57.170
Miley you don't seriously think that...

00:57.410 --> 01:01.270
'this' is gonna get Hottie Lomatie to ask you to prom do you?

01:01.430 --> 01:02.220
You're right.

01:02.340 --> 01:02.850
You're right.

01:02.850 --> 01:05.200
I'm acting like a little... little lovesick puppy, you know

01:05.209 --> 01:06.640
if it's meant to happen it'll happen.

01:06.670 --> 01:08.190
Absolutely. Good for you.

01:08.290 --> 01:09.280
We'll see you after class.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.210
I mean either way is fine with me.

01:11.330 --> 01:15.920
I mean I'm an... independent, mature, strong woman.

01:21.810 --> 01:26.380
Ask me to prom! Ask me to prom!

01:28.160 --> 01:32.090
-Oh, single people.  -So sad.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.360
-You are so cute. -You are cute!

01:34.440 --> 01:35.800
-You're cuter!  -Oh! Thank you.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.990
-You are the cutest girl I have ever seen.  -Wait!

01:45.730 --> 01:48.480
You get the limo out front.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.260
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.740
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

01:57.270 --> 02:01.320
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

02:01.910 --> 02:05.220
Who would've thought that a girl like me

02:05.390 --> 02:10.770
would double as a superstar?

02:11.330 --> 02:15.360
You get the best of both worlds.

02:19.290 --> 02:23.150
You get the best of both worlds.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.220
Mix it all together and you know that

02:26.250 --> 02:28.690
It's the best of both worlds.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.780
Hannah Montana  S03E14  Promma Mia

02:35.730 --> 02:37.160
(Seaview High School Junior Prom)

02:37.820 --> 02:38.520
Hey Miley.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.700
Oh Gabe. Hey, didn't even see you there.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.500
Where you headed? Over over... over there?

02:49.520 --> 02:52.990
Argh... yeah, you know. I'm just heading to English.

02:53.130 --> 02:57.060
Oh, eh... OK, yeah. That would just...

02:57.400 --> 03:01.470
that would just be to your right past the prom poster.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.980
And then another right... by the prom poster

03:03.980 --> 03:06.120
that... that you just saw.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.490
Right. Got it.

03:10.180 --> 03:15.220
You better hurry. It's always good to be 'prom'pt.

03:16.670 --> 03:20.510
Prompt! Prompt! Prompt!

03:25.000 --> 03:26.230
Hottie at 3:00!

03:31.880 --> 03:34.810
Ewgh! I wasted a good hair flip on Oliver?

03:35.550 --> 03:36.810
What! He's a hottie to me.

03:38.430 --> 03:40.040
-So cute.  -You're so cute!

03:40.450 --> 03:42.500
OK, never not gross.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.430
Bitter.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.310
Quick! Here's Gabe. Give me your perfume!

03:50.540 --> 03:51.750
-Oh, okay.  -Hurry.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.600
No, that's not my perfume that's my...

03:56.730 --> 03:58.100
Safety siren.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.650
Well, on the plus side he didn't notice you.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.500
Hey Gabe. There you are again.

04:12.590 --> 04:17.079
Are you following me? 'Cause here we are again.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.519
Just gettin' something to eat...

04:18.660 --> 04:22.790
Oh, well, I'm actually gettin' a low-cal beverage myself.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.800
Gonna make sure I'm looking good for any

04:24.800 --> 04:29.010
upcoming pep rallies, proms, football games,

04:29.090 --> 04:31.970
proms, and I don't know... the occasional prom.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.300
And eh... pop goes the weasel!

04:44.600 --> 04:46.030
Please tell me you thought that was adorable!

04:46.080 --> 04:47.050
Miley, are you okay?

04:47.310 --> 04:49.170
No. I'm not.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.830
I mean why can't you get that

04:50.830 --> 04:52.070
I wanna go to prom with you?

04:53.430 --> 04:54.550
She said sweetly.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.450
Miley, I'd love to--

04:57.290 --> 04:58.110
Yes!

04:58.500 --> 04:59.270
But I can't,

05:00.060 --> 05:02.220
Theresa Hartman already asked me this morning.

05:03.550 --> 05:06.640
Oh... that's Okay. I mean

05:07.200 --> 05:08.920
Theresa is a great girl and

05:09.660 --> 05:11.780
I bet for prom she will even shave her back.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.650
What?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.260
I'm just saying. Bye!

05:17.000 --> 05:18.280
Think about it this way:

05:18.540 --> 05:21.150
Now you don't have to worry about getting you hair done or

05:21.250 --> 05:22.990
finding the right shoes or

05:23.160 --> 05:25.720
finding that perfect dress that flows just right when

05:25.720 --> 05:28.640
you're slow dancing on that big romantic dance floor...

05:28.850 --> 05:32.390
feeling like the most special girl in the whole wide wor...

05:35.690 --> 05:40.330
So Amy. I was thinking that maybe if you're not going to the

05:40.400 --> 05:44.310
you know... prom, event, salutatory thing yet...

05:44.340 --> 05:48.300
maybe you and I could possibly, maybe go together.

05:48.330 --> 05:50.750
Or in separate cars. If that makes you more comfortable.

05:51.450 --> 05:55.190
We could go there together or in separate cars. Prom?

05:56.300 --> 05:59.870
Whoa! That's totally sweet of you.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.980
But to tell you the truth I'm waiting

06:01.980 --> 06:04.890
for somebody better to ask. Sorry.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.930
Oh. Appreciate the honesty.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.020
Poor Aaron.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.370
Yeah, no kidding.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.780
Man. I am so glad I'm not out there any more.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.310
That is embarrassing.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.030
Not that there aren't positives,

06:20.030 --> 06:23.130
I mean suffering helps you grow as a person.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.570
You know, Lily, you really should write a book.

06:25.740 --> 06:26.680
About what?

06:26.730 --> 06:28.760
I don't care as long as you stop talking.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.130
I'll be back.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.160
-Hey Aaron.  -Sorry I'll move.

06:34.190 --> 06:36.740
No! No, honey, sit. Um...

06:37.360 --> 06:38.350
I just want to say

06:39.400 --> 06:40.900
I saw what happen with Amy

06:40.900 --> 06:42.080
and I think it's totally unfair.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.090
Any girl in this school would be lucky to

06:44.090 --> 06:45.790
go to prom with a guy as nice as you.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.700
Really? You mean that?

06:47.720 --> 06:50.190
Yeah! You're great and don't you forget it.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.400
Will you go with me?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.870
Keep walking!

06:59.650 --> 07:00.570
Miley

07:02.440 --> 07:03.330
Dang it!

07:06.120 --> 07:07.790
You meant me, Miley?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.240
Will you go to prom with me?

07:14.240 --> 07:15.010
Sure.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.660
Yes! My best friend is not going to believe this.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.730
Hello mum? You're not going to believe this--

07:27.110 --> 07:29.250
I saw that coming from the minute you got up.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.440
Look. You know what it's OK. I'm doing a nice thing and

07:32.610 --> 07:33.500
I feel great about it.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.580
Gabe prom is gonna be so much fun.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.560
And now I feel even better.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:54.840 --> 07:55.630
Morning, dad.

07:56.190 --> 07:58.640
Morning? It's two in the afternoon.

08:00.130 --> 08:02.990
Fine, good afternoon then, Mr. Technicality.

08:03.530 --> 08:06.270
Wow, somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed

08:06.490 --> 08:09.300
Yes, I did.  Six hours ago!

08:10.120 --> 08:14.320
Oh, no wonder you're cranky. You probably need a nap.

08:16.110 --> 08:18.020
And you need a kick in the butt.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.400
You know, I let you come home from college

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
because you said you were homesick.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.150
And now I'm homesick, too.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.570
Sick I'm having you home doing nothing.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.520
Now just because Tennessee didn't work out

08:29.520 --> 08:31.060
doesn't mean you still can't go to college.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.120
But Dad, what if I don't want to go to college?

08:33.590 --> 08:36.840
And do what? You gotta have some plans for future.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.950
I have a plan. Inherit half of your money

08:38.960 --> 08:41.299
and if that runs out write a tell-all book about Miley.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.289
Done and done.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.400
Oh, you're done, alright?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.890
It's time for you to cowboy up and act like a man.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.660
Now tomorrow morning you're going down to

08:48.660 --> 08:50.860
Malibu Community College and enroll.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.400
I hear what you're saying, Dad,

08:52.400 --> 08:55.090
and I love the fact that you are so concerned about...

08:56.490 --> 08:59.360
That smells great. Are you doing something different?

08:59.390 --> 09:01.530
Actually I am. Half way through the rinse cycle

09:01.530 --> 09:03.930
I'm starting added just a dash of softener.

09:03.990 --> 09:05.600
It's made all the difference in the world.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.200
I can feel it.

09:07.260 --> 09:10.800
Oh, that is so nice when someone notices the hard...

09:11.280 --> 09:13.420
Wait a minute. We were talking about the college.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.390
Oh, right... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to try to change...

09:18.060 --> 09:20.000
look at that shine

09:20.160 --> 09:22.400
Are you wiping the floor with something different?

09:22.630 --> 09:23.690
I'm about to.

09:24.170 --> 09:27.060
Tomorrow. College. A.M.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.140
That means the morning.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.350
No, actually it means "a morning" not

09:31.350 --> 09:33.980
"the morning", otherwise it would be TM.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.040
And I'm the one that's asked to go to college

09:40.160 --> 09:43.630
A tell-all book about Miley? That's not a bad idea.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.590
Right?

09:46.690 --> 09:47.910
Get up there!

09:53.740 --> 09:56.910
Jackson Rod Stewart it's nine in the morning.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.340
I want your rear in gear in your car

09:59.340 --> 10:02.320
on your way to higher education in the next two minutes!

10:09.370 --> 10:13.040
Dad, I don't feel so good.

10:14.220 --> 10:18.230
Ohhh, poor little fella!

10:18.300 --> 10:19.980
Looks like you got a bad case of

10:19.990 --> 10:22.280
"I-think-my-Dad's-an-idiot"-itis.

10:22.550 --> 10:24.570
You know I'm not always trying to pull something.

10:24.570 --> 10:26.210
Sometimes I really am sick.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.230
And now, not only does my head hurt,

10:32.230 --> 10:35.780
but thanks to you, so does my heart.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.570
It would be nice if you believe me once in a while.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.950
And it would be nice if you put that lid back on that felt pen

10:44.260 --> 10:46.220
Now the rash is spread to your butt.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.840
Now get upstairs and change.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.240
Fine.

10:52.770 --> 10:56.410
Haha. Pen rash. I tried that when I was thirteen.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.000
You just spit in my eye!

11:02.080 --> 11:04.680
Yeah I did. Yeah I did.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.940
I just wanna thank you for

11:08.940 --> 11:10.740
being brave enough to have a second child.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.680
Honey, we all develop at our own pace.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.740
Whatever stops the tears, daddy.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.920
I'll tell you one thing I'm proud of...

11:19.270 --> 11:20.800
the way you stepped up to the plate

11:20.800 --> 11:23.160
tonight to go to the prom with that Aaron boy.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.240
You know that probably means the world to him.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.420
I'm happy to do it. Aaron's a sweet guy and

11:27.450 --> 11:29.210
you know sometimes it feels good doing something

11:29.210 --> 11:30.340
just because it's the right thing.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.080
Hello?

11:34.310 --> 11:36.240
Hey, Hannah, it's David Archuleta

11:39.050 --> 11:40.000
Hey David. What's up!

11:40.020 --> 11:42.090
Oh I'm in town recording and I was just

11:42.090 --> 11:44.430
thinking about how we talk about doing a duet together.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.720
Oh, yeah, I'd love to. Any time's great except for...

11:47.800 --> 11:48.570
Tonight?

11:48.670 --> 11:49.280
Exactly.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.630
-So you'll do it?  -Yeah.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.460
-Oh, great.  -When?

11:52.570 --> 11:53.750
-Tonight.  -Tonight?

11:54.030 --> 11:56.290
Tonight. Do we ever have a bad connection?

11:56.810 --> 11:58.040
No! Ah...

11:58.090 --> 12:00.900
I know it's last minute but I'm leaving town tomorrow

12:00.900 --> 12:02.380
and I just really wanted to work with you.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.400
But if you can't I totally understand.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.060
No! Ah...

12:08.930 --> 12:10.890
I was just going to say that um...

12:13.440 --> 12:16.090
I can cancel what I'm doing tonight. See you later! Bye.

12:18.870 --> 12:22.280
You know tomorrow I'm going to get you one of those cat bells.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.280
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.480
Miley Miley Miley.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.630
Whoa. There is no reason to three-Miley me.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.110
There is a perfectly good explanation for...

12:31.120 --> 12:32.340
Breaking that boy's heart?

12:32.850 --> 12:34.120
OK, Daddy.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.250
I think you need a little bit of perspective here.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.530
See if I go to prom with Aaron I make one guy happy,

12:40.630 --> 12:41.910
but if I do this duet with David

12:41.910 --> 12:43.820
we make millions of people happy.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.900
So see I think that if Aaron knew this, he would be

12:45.900 --> 12:48.300
the first to insist that I bail on prom and if he doesn't...

12:48.440 --> 12:50.450
I don't want to go with someone so selfish anyways.

12:50.630 --> 12:51.990
Oh and another thing is

12:51.990 --> 12:53.740
he kinda took advantage of me you know,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.680
when he cornered me into going out with him tonight.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.270
So I think that boy actually owes me an apology.

13:00.980 --> 13:01.610
Here you go.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.370
What's this for?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.040
Well if you're going to pile it out that deep

13:05.040 --> 13:06.880
you're going to need that to dig yourself out.

13:08.130 --> 13:09.630
I still shine next to Jackson!

13:10.580 --> 13:12.370
Whatever stops the tears darling.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.430
Ah. Ok.

13:24.590 --> 13:27.420
Aaron, I'm sorry but...

13:27.830 --> 13:29.660
No! Um,

13:29.820 --> 13:33.840
Aaron look, I, eh, in life bad things happen but...

13:34.540 --> 13:35.760
No...ehm...

13:35.870 --> 13:37.670
Come on, just do it.

13:37.670 --> 13:40.080
Do it you gutless little jellyfish, do it!

13:41.340 --> 13:43.000
Oh no, I did it!

13:43.080 --> 13:44.560
Why did you do it? Let's go!

13:45.650 --> 13:48.360
Miley, hey, hi, hey there.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.030
Aaron, hi...

13:51.310 --> 13:53.010
Why are you in your tux already?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.800
Oh, actually it's my Dad's tux

13:54.800 --> 13:56.380
my grandma is just tailoring a little.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.540
See, about that, it just...

13:59.620 --> 14:02.150
Aaron? Who is at the door?

14:02.860 --> 14:06.510
Oh, you must be Miley.

14:06.610 --> 14:07.550
Oh, you see, Aaron,

14:07.550 --> 14:11.160
I told you some pretty girl would snap you up.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.720
Yeah, about that...

14:12.820 --> 14:15.940
Grandpa, you were wrong, the boy didn't make her up.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.550
You owe me five bucks.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.120
You live with your grandparents?

14:20.310 --> 14:23.490
No, my parents are buying a new camera for tonight.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.350
New camera?

14:25.400 --> 14:27.370
Have to capture the big night.

14:28.130 --> 14:31.320
We flew in from Pittsburgh as soon as we got the news.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.330
Last minute flights are expensive

14:33.330 --> 14:36.350
so we had to dip into our meat money.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.570
Your meat money?

14:39.350 --> 14:41.470
Yes£¬but it was worth it,

14:41.560 --> 14:44.660
just to see the smile on my grandson's face

14:44.720 --> 14:46.510
Gamm-Gamm! Please!

14:46.520 --> 14:48.650
Oh alright. I'll leave you two alone.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.990
Grandpa get out of their refrigerator, that's their meat.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.190
Sorry about that.

14:59.410 --> 15:00.680
Yeah, it's OK.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.090
I forgive you

15:02.450 --> 15:03.490
because after all

15:03.490 --> 15:05.570
forgiveness is the most important thing in this world.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.420
what you know, it makes us human and

15:07.420 --> 15:08.490
seperates us for the animal kingdom,

15:08.510 --> 15:10.150
which reminds me, someday we should go to the zoo

15:10.150 --> 15:12.770
and then I can explain you why I can't go to the prom with you

15:12.780 --> 15:14.710
but you know, we'll have a big old laugh. Ha...

15:14.760 --> 15:16.640
I'll see you at school love the Gamm-Gamm bye.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.040
Bye, Miley.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.100
Oh, sweet pea, I iron these things enough.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.570
It's time for plan B

15:44.000 --> 15:46.350
So son, how did registration go?

15:46.860 --> 15:47.920
It didn't, OK!

15:48.620 --> 15:50.540
I went down there. I stood in line.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.300
the woman called out next and

15:52.510 --> 15:54.310
I didn't want to be next!

15:54.800 --> 15:57.180
I didn't even want to be next to next

15:57.240 --> 15:59.340
or... or next to the next to the next.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.770
to the next...

16:01.640 --> 16:02.880
I think you skipped a next.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.150
No. That next left before I did.

16:05.010 --> 16:05.640
Jackson.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.020
Look face it, Dad! I'm not college material.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.480
I'm, I'm... sleep till noon, eat toaster waffles

16:12.480 --> 16:14.780
play football online with some kid in Iceland

16:14.780 --> 16:16.740
and then take a power nap till dinner material!

16:17.670 --> 16:21.690
That's who I am. Just accept it, embrace it.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.250
Leave it alone.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.750
I think I know what this is about.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.910
It's totally natural for someone

16:28.910 --> 16:30.980
to be scared about going to college.

16:31.150 --> 16:35.450
Scared? You think that I'm scared?

16:35.590 --> 16:39.460
You think that Jackson Rod Stewart is scared?

16:46.040 --> 16:48.200
I'm terrified!!

16:52.550 --> 16:56.150
It's okay, son. It's okay. Change is always scary.

16:56.380 --> 16:59.960
But I know that you're brave enough and smart enough.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.800
You can nail it.

17:01.060 --> 17:04.450
No I'm not, dad. Look at me I'm a mess.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.829
It's Ok son,

17:06.829 --> 17:09.040
if you don't wanna go to college you don't have to.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.060
Really?

17:10.619 --> 17:11.720
Absolutely.

17:12.010 --> 17:15.250
If you wanna work at Rico's for the rest of your life...

17:15.250 --> 17:16.240
totally fine by me.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.950
For the rest of my life?

17:28.099 --> 17:31.990
Hey yoo. My aching back.

17:32.890 --> 17:34.590
Jackson, wake up.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.810
Miley Stewart is Hannah Montana...

17:38.300 --> 17:40.760
Oh no, I just gave up the secret.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.770
What secret?

17:43.040 --> 17:45.130
She anounced it at Red Vinyl

17:45.130 --> 17:49.800
Farewell Concert fifty Years ago.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.760
Oh, that's right yeah. I missed that one because I was eh...

17:54.770 --> 17:58.230
I was eh... I was eh

17:59.140 --> 18:00.000
Jackson!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.430
Miley Stewart is Hannah Montana!

18:03.260 --> 18:07.520
You're the worst excuse for an employee I ever had.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.700
You're fired.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.700
But... but what will I do?

18:13.130 --> 18:14.710
I never went to college

18:15.410 --> 18:17.210
That's your problem.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.260
Muhahah...

18:31.410 --> 18:33.400
I gotta register for college.

18:41.340 --> 18:42.160
Thanks, dad.

18:47.910 --> 18:51.000
I'm gonna need to leave that boy a lot of money.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.130
When I saw you over there

19:05.210 --> 19:06.610
I didn't mean to stare

19:06.670 --> 19:09.250
But my mind was everywhere I wanna know you

19:09.440 --> 19:10.940
Gonna guess that you're the kind

19:11.000 --> 19:12.330
To say what's on your mind

19:12.330 --> 19:14.900
But you listen when I have something to show you

19:15.270 --> 19:16.580
You smile, never shout

19:16.730 --> 19:18.060
You stand out in the crowd

19:18.200 --> 19:20.810
You make the best of every situation

19:21.010 --> 19:22.520
Correct me if I'm wrong

19:22.570 --> 19:23.990
You're fragile and you're strong

19:24.050 --> 19:26.460
A beautiful and perfect combination

19:31.380 --> 19:32.930
I wanna know you

19:36.990 --> 19:40.020
I wanna go there, where you go

19:40.030 --> 19:42.800
I wanna find out, what you know

19:42.900 --> 19:45.650
And maybe someday down the road

19:45.700 --> 19:48.220
I'll sit back and say to myself

19:48.270 --> 19:49.980
Yeah, I thought so

19:51.810 --> 19:53.020
Is everything OK?

19:54.400 --> 19:57.560
I'm sorry David. I'm just... I can't do this.

19:58.650 --> 20:00.360
It was the onion bagel wasn't it?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.700
No, no. You're fine.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.070
Just maybe... maybe next duet

20:04.070 --> 20:06.800
you might wanna try a nice little lemon bar.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.970
Then what is it?

20:09.590 --> 20:10.800
Oh no. When I called you you thought

20:10.800 --> 20:12.160
that I was David Cook.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.580
No no. It's just...

20:15.670 --> 20:19.010
I broke a promise that I... I really need to keep.

20:19.180 --> 20:20.170
Well, that's cool then.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.310
Do what you have to do. I totally understand.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.150
Thanks.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.510
I like how you are with me

20:28.620 --> 20:31.360
And our future history

20:31.450 --> 20:34.350
And maybe someday down the road

20:34.440 --> 20:36.820
I'll sit back and say to myself

20:37.120 --> 20:38.270
Yeah, I thought so

20:40.170 --> 20:44.900
I thought so, Who-whoa

20:45.230 --> 20:49.190
Yeah, Yeah

20:49.680 --> 20:54.270
Yeah, yeah

20:54.290 --> 20:55.720
I wanna know you

20:55.720 --> 21:00.020
Yeah, yeah

21:00.090 --> 21:02.860
I wanna go there, where you go

21:02.990 --> 21:05.630
I wanna find out, what you know

21:05.820 --> 21:08.580
And maybe someday down the road

21:08.730 --> 21:11.050
I'll sit back and say to myself

21:11.520 --> 21:14.370
I like how you are with me

21:14.380 --> 21:17.020
Oh yeah our future history

21:17.210 --> 21:19.970
And maybe someday down the road

21:20.170 --> 21:22.810
I'll sit back and say to myself

21:23.000 --> 21:24.260
Yeah I thought so

21:28.180 --> 21:29.670
You got any eights?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.250
Go fish!

21:32.710 --> 21:34.130
You got any fives?

21:35.470 --> 21:36.730
Go fish!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.590
Liar! I know you got fives.

21:39.930 --> 21:40.600
How?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.900
Look at your hand when you went to the bathroom.

21:43.020 --> 21:43.620
What?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.600
Well, you were in there long enough.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.460
-Cheater!  -Liar!

21:48.480 --> 21:49.620
-Cheater!  -Liar!

21:49.630 --> 21:51.580
-Cheater!  -Liar!

21:51.630 --> 21:55.550
Get sick you old geezer. You're going down.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.660
Well, bring it on.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.250
You OK?

22:05.420 --> 22:07.550
-Yeah, you?  -Yeah.

22:08.030 --> 22:09.930
And go!
