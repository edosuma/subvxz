00:03.916 --> 00:05.598
Previously on "Stitchers":

00:05.623 --> 00:07.829
Wait. That's weird. There's a boy here.

00:07.854 --> 00:10.775
We use nanobot technology in the bodies.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.946
It's the key into stitching
into their memories.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.105
Turner's memory is a mess.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.390
It's making me really dizzy.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.599
I have been just so flooded...

00:19.222 --> 00:21.159
with all of these feelings, but...

00:21.184 --> 00:23.664
You just need time. It's... it's
what you're trying to tell me.

00:24.696 --> 00:26.703
Meet Theo, my brother.

00:26.728 --> 00:28.861
When Theo shows up, trouble follows.

00:28.886 --> 00:30.719
He just showed up at my door.

00:30.744 --> 00:32.384
So nobody taught you
never to feed a stray.

00:32.409 --> 00:33.376
So he's gone.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.260
Yep.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.577
He cleared out.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.804
You told me that Ed was cremated.

00:37.829 --> 00:38.947
That's what I was told too.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.558
Let's say I was trying to find someone

00:40.583 --> 00:42.380
who did want to disappear.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.458
Your father?

00:43.483 --> 00:45.868
Everything is math,
so maybe there is an equation

00:45.893 --> 00:48.298
to solving the mystery
of finding your father.

00:50.209 --> 00:51.500
Camille: Is that him?

00:51.525 --> 00:52.928
Yeah.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.276
Ed wanted to be cremated.

00:57.301 --> 01:00.973
I'm just glad I was finally
able to do it for him.

01:01.290 --> 01:04.894
God, I cannot believe
Turner kept Ed's body

01:04.920 --> 01:07.205
on ice this whole time. That's just...

01:07.230 --> 01:09.150
Disturbing? Or criminal?

01:09.175 --> 01:10.711
All of the above.

01:11.107 --> 01:13.099
But Turner's dead and nobody's mourning

01:13.124 --> 01:14.482
his sorry ash, so...

01:14.507 --> 01:16.982
maybe there's karmic justice
in the world after all.

01:17.007 --> 01:18.924
Where am I gonna put him?

01:18.949 --> 01:20.732
Well, how 'bout over here?

01:21.173 --> 01:24.342
I made a little, uh, spot for him. See?

01:24.367 --> 01:26.545
Thank you.

01:28.115 --> 01:29.615
Camille: So I have an idea.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.254
How about you, me, Linus,
and Cameron just go out tonight

01:33.279 --> 01:34.915
and, like, blow off some steam?

01:34.940 --> 01:36.604
- Cameron? I don't know.
- Why?

01:36.629 --> 01:37.622
Are things bad with Goodkin?

01:37.647 --> 01:39.174
No, they're fine.

01:39.384 --> 01:40.809
Just...

01:40.834 --> 01:43.339
what I really wanna do is
find that son of a bitch

01:43.364 --> 01:45.996
father of mine and bring
him to karmic justice.

02:31.356 --> 02:33.585
Camille's brother stole my stuff.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.913
Wait. Rewind.

02:34.938 --> 02:37.657
Theo took all of my smart appliances.

02:37.682 --> 02:39.596
He took my smart dishwasher,

02:39.621 --> 02:40.747
he took my smart oven,

02:40.772 --> 02:42.259
he took my smart washer-dryer.

02:42.284 --> 02:43.405
I guess it wasn't so smart

02:43.430 --> 02:44.964
to let Theo crash with you then, huh?

02:44.989 --> 02:46.011
Have you called your landlord or...

02:46.036 --> 02:47.561
I'm already on thin ice with her.

02:47.586 --> 02:49.423
Apparently a tenant called
and complained about me.

02:49.449 --> 02:50.362
Complained about what?

02:50.386 --> 02:51.848
That I was making too much noise.

02:51.873 --> 02:53.375
It was probably Theo too.

02:53.823 --> 02:55.702
Look, I just need to keep
everything on the D.L.

02:55.727 --> 02:57.576
and I need to replace all
of the appliances on my own.

02:57.601 --> 02:58.563
I just don't have the money.

02:58.588 --> 03:00.197
Well, why don't you just
stay with your parents?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.549
Are you kidding? If they ever found out

03:01.574 --> 03:04.102
about this,
I would never hear the end of it.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.582
I'm getting the feeling you
don't want me as a roommate.

03:06.607 --> 03:08.048
I don't.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.712
Dude, I had a roommate
freshman year who insisted

03:10.737 --> 03:12.077
on writing his term papers in the nude

03:12.102 --> 03:13.261
while sitting on my bed,

03:13.286 --> 03:15.016
and after that, I was
like, "Never again."

03:15.041 --> 03:17.399
First of all,
I'm not a clothing optional kind of guy,

03:17.424 --> 03:20.007
and secondly, I'm not some stranger

03:20.032 --> 03:22.423
who's assigned to you
to be your dorm-mate.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.358
I'm your best friend.

03:24.512 --> 03:26.011
Hmm.

03:26.158 --> 03:28.149
- (phones chiming)
- Oh.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.567
It's Maggie. New sample.

03:30.896 --> 03:33.516
So, what do you say? Help a brother out?

03:33.655 --> 03:36.653
- Fine, you can stay.
- All right! I owe you one!

03:36.678 --> 03:38.616
So, how long do you think it'll
take to replace all your stuff?

03:38.641 --> 03:41.502
Not long. Three, four months tops.

03:41.527 --> 03:43.766
Hey, Fisher. How are you feeling?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.328
Stronger everyday.

03:45.353 --> 03:47.054
Good. I'm glad.

03:47.079 --> 03:50.267
Uh, any, uh, official leads on my dad?

03:50.291 --> 03:52.455
Stinger did a great job erasing himself.

03:52.481 --> 03:54.620
(coffee pouring)

03:55.486 --> 03:58.523
But maybe my dad's been
tech-savvy for so long,

03:58.548 --> 04:00.928
he's forgotten there's a
whole world of information

04:00.953 --> 04:02.478
that isn't digital.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.747
Like, my garage is full of boxes,

04:04.772 --> 04:06.157
and before I knew the
house was my family's,

04:06.182 --> 04:08.266
I kind of assumed that
it was Ed's, but...

04:08.291 --> 04:10.728
maybe there's something
in there from my dad.

04:10.753 --> 04:13.604
Yeah. Well, if you need any help
looking through it, let me know.

04:13.629 --> 04:14.532
Thanks.

04:14.557 --> 04:15.338
Morning.

04:15.363 --> 04:17.074
- Hey, Cam.
- Hey.

04:17.099 --> 04:18.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.201
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

04:20.225 --> 04:21.878
- You take it.
- Uh, no.

04:21.903 --> 04:23.253
It's the... it's the last caramel one.

04:23.278 --> 04:24.510
That's fine. I'll grab something else.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.920
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,
it's your favorite.

04:25.945 --> 04:27.528
You were here first. Just take it.

04:27.553 --> 04:28.966
- It's not...
- Cameron, just take it.

04:28.991 --> 04:31.711
- Excuse me.
- I'll take the...

04:31.736 --> 04:34.503
(machine whirs)

04:34.528 --> 04:36.415
(sighs)

04:36.868 --> 04:39.796
(coffee pours)

04:41.005 --> 04:42.249
Hi.

04:42.274 --> 04:43.323
What?

04:43.348 --> 04:44.917
Theo stole your stuff?

04:44.943 --> 04:45.975
Why didn't you tell me?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.540
Be... because it's no big deal.

04:47.565 --> 04:50.403
Linus, no big deal is
losing a sock in the dryer,

04:50.427 --> 04:53.465
not having your smart dryer
stolen by my dumb brother!

04:53.490 --> 04:55.946
Why are you yelling at me?
I am the victim here.

04:55.972 --> 04:56.963
(sighs)

04:56.988 --> 04:58.283
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:58.308 --> 05:01.215
What about, um, your renters insurance?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.067
Renter's insurance.
Is... is that a thing?

05:03.092 --> 05:05.092
Oh, Linus. Okay.

05:05.117 --> 05:07.390
Um, I guess I'll try to cover

05:07.414 --> 05:08.392
the cost of whatever he took from you.

05:08.417 --> 05:09.654
No. Absolutely not.

05:09.679 --> 05:11.291
Maggie: Listen up, everyone.

05:11.316 --> 05:12.811
(sighs)

05:14.122 --> 05:17.509
Maggie: A John Doe was found
dead in a dumpster in Carson.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.739
Cause of death: repeated
blunt force trauma

05:19.764 --> 05:20.850
to the head and body.

05:20.874 --> 05:23.037
Ligature marks on his wrists and ankles

05:23.063 --> 05:25.931
suggest that he was
restrained during the attack.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.427
Did we get a hit on his fingerprints?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.810
John Doe's fingerprints are missing.

05:28.835 --> 05:30.392
Looks like they were burned off.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.728
Based on scar tissue,
it appears it happened

05:32.753 --> 05:33.957
at least a year ago.

05:33.982 --> 05:35.710
So, his fingerprints were removed

05:35.735 --> 05:37.447
long before he was beaten to death.

05:37.472 --> 05:38.891
Don't criminals sometimes

05:38.915 --> 05:40.728
burn their fingerprints off
to conceal their identities?

05:40.754 --> 05:43.136
Which is why we need to
figure out who he was

05:43.161 --> 05:44.788
and why he was murdered.

05:46.426 --> 05:47.862
Com check one, two.

05:47.887 --> 05:49.105
I hear you.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.272
Hey, Stretch,
go to a private channel for a moment.

05:51.297 --> 05:52.531
(beeping)

05:52.556 --> 05:53.855
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.152
We've got a job to do.

05:55.177 --> 05:56.696
Yeah. Your point?

05:56.721 --> 05:58.771
You know, you and me working together,

05:58.796 --> 06:00.375
it's not gonna be awkward, is it?

06:00.400 --> 06:03.501
Oh. Wait, you mean
like you just made it?

06:04.658 --> 06:06.198
So...

06:06.223 --> 06:08.918
I never actually figured
out what you do here.

06:08.943 --> 06:10.076
(chuckles)

06:10.101 --> 06:11.345
Well...

06:11.370 --> 06:14.831
uh, initially I was
recruited to spy on Kirsten,

06:14.856 --> 06:17.361
but that mission's
been aborted obviously.

06:17.386 --> 06:19.993
So, now I stand here and
hold this tablet computer.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.022
- That's it?
- No, no.

06:23.047 --> 06:24.981
Sometimes I stand over there

06:25.006 --> 06:26.874
and occasionally save everyone's life.

06:26.899 --> 06:28.766
I'm itching for another
assignment of some kind.

06:28.791 --> 06:30.816
- Like in the field?
- Yes. God.

06:30.841 --> 06:33.465
Then you should take your self-defense
training to the next level.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.502
I'd hate to see something happen to you.

06:35.527 --> 06:37.373
But I thought you were my coach.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.397
No.

06:38.422 --> 06:41.278
You need something more... brutal.

06:41.304 --> 06:42.499
More brutal than you?

06:42.524 --> 06:43.827
I didn't know that was possible.

06:43.851 --> 06:44.789
Oh. Why, thank you.

06:44.815 --> 06:46.475
- Cameron?
- Hm?

06:46.500 --> 06:49.179
Any chance you might switch
back to an open channel

06:49.203 --> 06:51.547
before John Doe becomes unstitchable?

06:51.572 --> 06:52.559
Right. Sorry.

06:52.584 --> 06:53.992
Okay, we are back on the air.

06:54.017 --> 06:55.772
Mission clock set to
five minute, please.

06:55.797 --> 06:58.217
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

06:58.242 --> 07:01.126
In three, two, one, mark!

07:01.151 --> 07:03.701
(whirring)

07:03.863 --> 07:06.754
_

07:07.384 --> 07:09.444
Your total is $36.05.

07:09.469 --> 07:11.475
I am in a supermarket.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.585
The Green Basket.

07:13.610 --> 07:15.445
Looking up The Green Basket.

07:15.470 --> 07:17.933
See? I am important.

07:19.838 --> 07:21.638
John Doe is bagging groceries.

07:21.663 --> 07:22.775
Bagging like he's in

07:22.800 --> 07:24.405
one of those self checkout lines or...

07:24.430 --> 07:26.464
No, bagging like...

07:26.489 --> 07:27.590
he's a bag boy.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.448
The Green Basket is an independent

07:29.473 --> 07:30.759
family-owned market in Culver City.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.163
Mr. Hughes, I have another one.

07:33.188 --> 07:34.349
Okay, Jamie.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.785
Let me hear it.

07:38.036 --> 07:39.826
John Doe's name is Jamie.

07:39.851 --> 07:40.997
Jamie B.

07:41.022 --> 07:43.502
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

07:43.527 --> 07:45.564
- Peanut butter.
- Peanut butter who?

07:45.589 --> 07:48.156
- Clean up on aisle five!
- (laughs)

07:48.181 --> 07:49.864
That... Now, that's your best one yet.

07:49.889 --> 07:51.267
(laughter)

07:51.292 --> 07:53.539
Now go on ahead and help
Mrs. Wilkins out to her car.

07:53.564 --> 07:56.222
Okay.
Don't forget your receipt, Mrs. Wilkins.

07:56.247 --> 07:59.460
Jamie couldn't have been
a spy or a criminal.

08:00.302 --> 08:03.184
- Why is that?
- He just couldn't.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.915
Wait, something's going on.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.018
Uh, remember the boy in
the red baseball hat?

08:09.043 --> 08:10.721
The one I saw in Captain
Mulaney's memory?

08:10.746 --> 08:11.786
Yeah. What about him?

08:11.811 --> 08:13.866
He's here in Jamie's memory too.

08:13.891 --> 08:15.238
In the store.

08:15.263 --> 08:17.017
He must be connected to both cases.

08:17.042 --> 08:19.993
Fisher, let's get the security
cam video from the store.

08:20.018 --> 08:21.149
Let Linus take a look.

08:21.174 --> 08:22.732
Maybe we can I.D. this kid.

08:22.757 --> 08:26.215
Okay, Kirsten,
I'm moving you to a memory hotspot.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.286
Everything just went dark.

08:31.850 --> 08:34.827
Nothing wrong on my end. Linus?

08:35.107 --> 08:36.630
Wait.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.557
Man: Stop the act, Rain Man!

08:38.582 --> 08:39.493
- (punching, grunt)
- (gasps)

08:39.518 --> 08:40.472
Kirsten, what's wrong?

08:40.496 --> 08:41.741
Jamie just got punched.

08:41.767 --> 08:44.735
Guys, I think he's blindfolded
and tied down to something.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.188
Jamie: Please!

08:46.213 --> 08:47.712
Stop!

08:47.737 --> 08:48.987
He's scared and confused.

08:49.012 --> 08:51.233
Man:
I'll stop when you give us what we want!

08:51.259 --> 08:52.547
- (punching)
- (gasps)

08:52.572 --> 08:54.029
(groans) There's a man here.

08:54.054 --> 08:55.559
Man: We know you have it!

08:55.584 --> 08:58.702
Jamie:
I don't understand what your words mean.

08:58.727 --> 09:01.375
- (punching)
- (gasps)

09:01.400 --> 09:03.479
- (fast blipping)
- Heart rate and blood pressure rising.

09:03.503 --> 09:04.428
She's in the death memory.

09:04.453 --> 09:05.554
This is the end of the line.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.866
Kirsten, you're getting closer
to the memory of Jamie's death.

09:07.891 --> 09:08.709
Make the bounce!

09:08.734 --> 09:10.127
- Jamie: No!
- (slam)

09:10.152 --> 09:11.117
(gasps)

09:11.142 --> 09:13.400
Kirsten: He just died.

09:13.425 --> 09:15.727
<i>(jazz music playing)</i>

09:17.726 --> 09:19.695

09:23.429 --> 09:25.583
- Kirsten?
- (gasping)

09:25.608 --> 09:27.300
Jamie's under water! He's drowning!

09:27.325 --> 09:28.960
Drowning? Linus, where is she?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.172
She's in an earlier memory.

09:31.197 --> 09:32.674
This is much earlier.

09:32.699 --> 09:34.719
He can't have two death memories.
It's impossible.

09:34.744 --> 09:36.064
Kirsten, make the bounce!

09:36.089 --> 09:37.070
I heart Linus.

09:37.095 --> 09:39.505
(gasping)

09:39.529 --> 09:40.569
(coughing)

09:40.594 --> 09:42.385
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Deep
breaths, deep breaths.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.043
Kirsten, how did Jamie B. die?

09:44.067 --> 09:46.374
Was he beaten to death or did he drown?

09:46.400 --> 09:47.774
Both.

09:48.075 --> 09:51.062
He... he died twice.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.416
Guys, the medical examiner's report

09:57.441 --> 09:59.036
said there was no water in his lungs.

09:59.062 --> 10:01.401
He died of blunt force
trauma, not drowning.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.482
Poor guy.

10:02.507 --> 10:03.553
Who would want to hurt him?

10:03.578 --> 10:05.856
Whoever it was wanted
information from him,

10:05.881 --> 10:07.718
but he didn't know what
they were talking about.

10:07.743 --> 10:09.396
It must have been mistaken identity.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.341
They got the wrong guy.

10:10.366 --> 10:11.509
Yeah, but why two death memories?

10:11.534 --> 10:13.564
That part is a puzzle.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.601
We just spoke to Mr. Hughes,

10:15.626 --> 10:17.707
the store manager at The Green Basket.

10:17.732 --> 10:19.333
Told him about Jamie B.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.260
- How'd he take it?
- Not well.

10:21.286 --> 10:24.043
He said that Jamie wandered
into the store eight months ago

10:24.068 --> 10:26.254
with virtually no memory
just repeating his name.

10:26.279 --> 10:28.195
- "Jamie B."
- Was it amnesia?

10:28.220 --> 10:30.610
Usually, in amnesia cases, there's
at least a missing person's report,

10:30.634 --> 10:32.936
but I checked.
Nobody was looking for Jamie B.

10:32.961 --> 10:35.075
Mr. Hughes took to Jamie so much,

10:35.100 --> 10:37.146
he gave him a job, a place to live.

10:37.171 --> 10:38.899
A room in the back of the store.

10:38.924 --> 10:40.319
See what you can find there.

10:40.345 --> 10:41.951
I'll head back to the crime scene.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.230
See if we missed anything.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.239
Hey, wait, hold on.

10:45.264 --> 10:48.347
Um, listen,
I feel awful that Theo ripped you off.

10:48.372 --> 10:50.360
I should have insisted
you not take him in.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.327
- I mean, I did...
- Don't. It's okay.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.136
It's just stuff.

10:58.536 --> 11:01.588
He had nowhere to go, no home...

11:01.613 --> 11:03.394
no family.

11:03.717 --> 11:06.547
At least, nothing he remembered.

11:07.222 --> 11:09.429
And... and when did you last see him?

11:09.454 --> 11:11.308
Two days ago.

11:11.809 --> 11:13.566
That Jamie was a wanderer.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.258
Did Jamie leave anything behind?

11:16.283 --> 11:19.115
Some clothes, uh...

11:19.140 --> 11:21.328
a notebook.

11:22.008 --> 11:23.866
He only had what I gave him,

11:23.891 --> 11:25.557
which wasn't very much.

11:25.598 --> 11:27.598
Our boss said that, um,

11:27.623 --> 11:29.175
you had a video card for us.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.131
Oh, yeah.

11:31.837 --> 11:33.999
Thank you.

11:36.711 --> 11:39.105
(sighs shakily)

11:41.552 --> 11:43.385
You were there for him

11:43.420 --> 11:45.590
when no one else was.

11:47.612 --> 11:50.820
_

11:51.514 --> 11:53.739
_

11:53.764 --> 11:56.314
- You all right?
- It's family drama.

11:56.350 --> 11:58.682
Theo's a handful, isn't he?

12:01.635 --> 12:05.111
I've vetted everyone
involved with this program.

12:06.106 --> 12:08.271
I have to be able to predict my team

12:08.296 --> 12:11.257
based on behavior patterns
and family history.

12:11.282 --> 12:14.228
Well, I bet you had a field
day with my family history.

12:14.253 --> 12:16.287
Well, your upbringing wasn't a picnic.

12:16.312 --> 12:17.344
You rose above it.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.802
Yeah, until Hurricane
Theo blew into town.

12:19.827 --> 12:21.480
You're strong, smart.

12:21.505 --> 12:24.507
I think that you are a
natural for this line of work.

12:24.532 --> 12:28.197
Well, no one stands around
and holds a tablet like I do.

12:28.222 --> 12:30.634
That's not the work I'm talking about.

12:31.549 --> 12:34.214
I know you're anxious to do
something more challenging.

12:34.239 --> 12:36.740
I just need to make sure
you're ready for it.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.572
How will you know?

12:39.597 --> 12:41.103
Trust me, we'll both know.

12:41.907 --> 12:44.660
You're not the same girl
with the crappy past

12:44.685 --> 12:46.647
that left Bakersfield a few years ago.

12:46.672 --> 12:50.392
So, do what you need to
do to make things right.

12:54.214 --> 12:57.057

12:59.519 --> 13:02.690

13:04.101 --> 13:06.049
So, I may be a little new at this,

13:06.074 --> 13:08.718
but when did hugging become
part of our investigative tools?

13:08.743 --> 13:09.881
What do you mean?

13:09.906 --> 13:12.242
You and the manager at the supermarket.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.074
Mm.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.958
Well, I don't know. It just, um...

13:16.983 --> 13:18.352
came over me.

13:18.377 --> 13:20.305
It seemed like the right thing to do.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.663
Mr. Hughes was like a father to Jamie.

13:23.944 --> 13:25.810
Ed Clark...

13:26.306 --> 13:29.373
he took care of me when my father left.

13:29.449 --> 13:32.375
He didn't have to, but he did,

13:32.400 --> 13:34.417
and I guess, um...

13:36.603 --> 13:37.959
(sighs)

13:37.984 --> 13:41.039
I guess in my way, I was grateful.

13:44.611 --> 13:46.976
But I never told him.

13:49.149 --> 13:51.776
You know, and now he's dead, so...

- What are you talking about?

awkward for you and Kirsten.

What is going on with you guys?

14:56.222 --> 14:58.599
Nothing.
Just when she stitched into my memories,

14:58.624 --> 15:00.741
she basically tripped
over my feelings for her.

15:00.766 --> 15:01.995
That's all.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.819
- She knows how you feel.
- Yeah!

15:04.697 --> 15:07.546
- Oh, that sucks.
- Why?

15:07.606 --> 15:09.773
Because she has all the power now.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.400
No, I know how she feels too though.

15:11.425 --> 15:13.047
No, you just think you do.

15:13.072 --> 15:14.238
Let me guess...

15:14.551 --> 15:16.503
- "I need time to understand my feelings."
- Oh...

15:16.528 --> 15:17.611
Look, it's typical!

15:17.636 --> 15:19.877
Dude, just cut her some slack, man.

15:19.902 --> 15:22.553
I mean, until recently, she didn't
have many feelings to understand.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.087
Look, I love both of you guys.

15:24.112 --> 15:25.481
I just don't see it happening.

15:25.506 --> 15:26.506

15:27.803 --> 15:30.544
You greased the wheels with wine,
you shared a pizza,

15:30.569 --> 15:33.408
- you were face to face and you...
- And you ruined the moment.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.892
If the moment was meant to happen,

15:34.917 --> 15:37.439
an Indian guy in his boxers
wouldn't be able to ruin it.

15:37.464 --> 15:39.158
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

15:39.183 --> 15:41.177
- Why?
- Driving me nuts!

15:41.202 --> 15:44.052

15:47.401 --> 15:49.042
That was our first fight.

15:56.451 --> 15:57.517
My father left in a rush,

15:57.551 --> 15:59.718
so he probably didn't have
time to cover his tracks.

15:59.743 --> 16:01.941
I mean, his analog ones, that is.

16:01.966 --> 16:04.441
Well, maybe something
here will lead us to him.

16:07.468 --> 16:09.588
Can I ask you a question?

16:09.613 --> 16:10.695
Sure.

16:10.731 --> 16:13.259
When did you first know
you loved your wife?

16:13.284 --> 16:14.790
You mean the wife who left me?

16:14.815 --> 16:17.766
The wife who was convinced
that I was 51% cop

16:17.791 --> 16:18.824
and 49% husband?

16:18.849 --> 16:21.078
- You mean that wife?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

16:21.103 --> 16:22.520
No, it's...

16:22.546 --> 16:23.698
it's okay.

16:23.723 --> 16:25.270
I don't know that she was wrong.

16:25.295 --> 16:27.122
We did love each other once.

16:27.783 --> 16:29.316
A lot.

16:30.461 --> 16:32.399
It was a different life ago.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.041
When I first met you,

16:35.187 --> 16:36.583
you used to wear your wedding band,

16:36.608 --> 16:37.908
but you haven't since the hospital.

16:37.933 --> 16:39.442
It was time to move on.

16:39.858 --> 16:42.455
So, based on my inability
to stay married,

16:42.481 --> 16:43.557
maybe I shouldn't be the one

16:43.581 --> 16:44.958
that gives you relationship advice.

16:44.983 --> 16:46.643
That being said, I do
know how hard it is

18:27.175 --> 18:29.292
Wait, like,
his first issue of his first series

18:29.317 --> 18:31.706
that was ignobly canceled in 1963?

18:31.731 --> 18:33.274
So I take it you're interested?

18:33.299 --> 18:35.181
Yeah! Hell yeah! Yeah!

18:35.539 --> 18:38.790
Then, uh, type your number in my phone

18:38.815 --> 18:40.815
and I'll give you a
call when it comes in.

18:41.043 --> 18:43.292
Cameron: <i>Induce stitch
neurosync on my mark.</i>

18:43.317 --> 18:46.496
<i>In three, two, one, mark!</i>

18:47.309 --> 18:49.297
We've been here before, Cameron.

18:49.322 --> 18:51.394
I need to go further
back in Jamie's memory.

18:52.201 --> 18:54.906
Finding a hotspot. Stand by.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.471
Hold up. Something is not right.

18:59.496 --> 19:03.293
I am seeing two separate
memories overlapping.

19:03.318 --> 19:05.391
Jamie at The Green Basket...

19:07.293 --> 19:09.413
and Jamie in a lab?

19:09.438 --> 19:11.605
- What lab?
- Can you stabilize the image?

19:11.630 --> 19:13.607
I see the anomaly. Let me try something.

19:13.632 --> 19:15.508
- (keyboard clicking)
- (beep)

19:15.533 --> 19:16.412
Here you go.

19:16.437 --> 19:17.866
Kirsten, you still seeing doubles?

19:17.891 --> 19:19.764
It's stable.

19:21.756 --> 19:23.867
I'm in a research lab of some kind.

19:23.892 --> 19:25.464
Half the time.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.684
Jamie's talking to a woman.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.140
What's a bag boy doing in a lab?

19:29.165 --> 19:30.352
What's Jamie doing there?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.620
They can navigate across
the surface of the water,

19:32.644 --> 19:36.055
consuming the hydrocarbons
of the oil in half the time.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.746
Jamie was a scientist.

19:37.771 --> 19:39.525
I thought Jamie was...

19:39.550 --> 19:42.267
He was,
but now he's talking about hydrocarbons.

19:42.293 --> 19:45.648
How soon do you think you'll be
able to replicate your nanobots?

19:45.673 --> 19:47.458
Two weeks?

19:47.483 --> 19:50.273
I still need to make
some programming changes.

19:51.913 --> 19:53.746
Jamie worked at MeriCorp Energy.

19:53.771 --> 19:54.811
It's an oil company

19:54.836 --> 19:56.584
with a research facility in Pasadena.

19:56.609 --> 19:58.342
Linus: Found another hotspot.

19:58.366 --> 20:01.394
Hang on. You're going on the move.

20:01.836 --> 20:04.450
(whirring)

20:06.175 --> 20:09.437
- (whirring)
- (screams)

20:17.623 --> 20:20.813
_

20:26.082 --> 20:28.059
Just give it to me.

20:30.072 --> 20:32.567
(Jamie screams)

20:35.510 --> 20:37.568
He's at the underwater
death memory moment.

20:37.593 --> 20:39.708
Kirsten, make the bounce!

20:46.755 --> 20:48.114
Jamie was a scientist

20:48.139 --> 20:49.836
who was working on nanobot technology

20:49.862 --> 20:51.458
for MeriCorp Energy.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.642
Something went wrong

20:52.667 --> 20:54.518
and he was trying to keep it secure.

20:54.542 --> 20:57.251
- What about the drowning?
- Someone cornered him for the code.

20:57.276 --> 20:59.209
That's when he fell off the
cliff and into the water.

20:59.234 --> 21:01.526
Only he survived,
but he suffered brain damage.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.718
Cut to yesterday when
Jamie's body was found...

21:03.743 --> 21:06.160
this time, really dead.

21:06.185 --> 21:09.000
Whatever Jamie was working
on at MeriCorp Energy

21:09.025 --> 21:11.320
is what got him killed.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.329
Let's talk nanobots.

21:18.354 --> 21:20.680
Microscopic, programmable,
self-replicating machines.

21:20.705 --> 21:22.548
We know about nanobots.
We have plenty of our own.

21:22.573 --> 21:23.706
Hello. Talking.

21:23.741 --> 21:27.647
So our nanobots,
programmed by the quantum computer.

21:27.672 --> 21:29.388
We circulate them through our subjects

21:29.413 --> 21:30.579
to bridge the gaps in their synapses.

21:30.604 --> 21:31.724
That's what makes stitching work.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.607
Now Kirsten, in the stitch,
you said you heard Jamie

21:33.632 --> 21:35.298
talking about hydrocarbons, right?

21:35.374 --> 21:36.373
Mm-hmm.

21:36.398 --> 21:37.531
Okay, so story time.

21:37.556 --> 21:39.255
About, like, five years ago,

21:39.280 --> 21:41.511
I was dating this oil
rig worker named Dirk.

21:41.536 --> 21:44.145
Dirk? You dated a Dirk?

21:44.579 --> 21:46.197
What's he got to do with anything?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.288
Only everything. Let me elaborate.

21:48.313 --> 21:50.450
- My ex-boyfriend, Dirk...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.414
I thought you just dated him.
Now he's an ex-boyfriend?

21:53.439 --> 21:55.012
Still talking.

21:55.819 --> 21:58.563
So Dirk said there was a company

21:58.588 --> 22:00.388
working on technology
to clean oil spills

22:00.413 --> 22:02.941
using hydrocarbon-eating nanobots.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.945
You guys, I bet Jamie was
developing that technology

22:06.970 --> 22:08.861
for MeriCorp Energy,
only he accidentally

22:08.886 --> 22:12.020
his nanobots to consume
carbon instead of hydrocarbon.

22:12.045 --> 22:15.147
Carbon, as in living tissue, as in...

22:15.172 --> 22:16.785
- People.
- It's worse than that.

22:16.810 --> 22:19.757
Guys,
we all know that people are not the only

22:19.782 --> 22:21.481
carbon-based life forms on the planet.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.669
Plants, animals, insects,

22:22.694 --> 22:23.827
everything up and down the food chain.

22:23.852 --> 22:26.348
And if those nanobots
are self-replicating,

22:26.373 --> 22:28.000
they won't stop making
more of themselves

22:28.025 --> 22:28.975
until they run out of food.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.208
So, we're talking about, like,
a whole world of gray goo.

22:32.941 --> 22:36.485
- Where are you going?
- To poke a bear.

22:37.176 --> 22:39.201
- You're welcome.
- (phone chimes)

22:39.763 --> 22:40.713
(phone beeps)

22:40.738 --> 22:42.280
_

22:45.360 --> 22:47.785
_

22:47.810 --> 22:50.092
So you went out with someone named Dirk?

22:50.117 --> 22:52.118
Oh, Dirk and I only
dated for about a week.

22:52.143 --> 22:53.143
Oh.

22:53.453 --> 22:56.378
I dated his sister a lot longer.

22:56.403 --> 22:57.569
(chuckles)

22:57.594 --> 23:00.243
Wait, his sister? What?

23:01.175 --> 23:02.885
- Kirsten, we need to talk.
- Yeah, agreed.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.651
When we get upstairs,
I'll handle the whole

23:04.677 --> 23:05.917
"Who the hell killed Jamie?"

23:05.942 --> 23:07.425
and you do... just do
the nanobot of it all.

23:07.450 --> 23:10.537
I mean we need to talk.

23:10.855 --> 23:12.931
Last night when you
were at my apartment,

23:12.956 --> 23:15.605
you were acting a little...

23:15.630 --> 23:17.747
A little what?

23:17.772 --> 23:19.020
(phone rings)

23:19.045 --> 23:21.351
Just a second.

23:21.982 --> 23:24.088
- Hello?
- (sighs)

23:24.113 --> 23:25.340
Nina!

23:25.365 --> 23:28.569
Um, yeah, no, no, it's okay.

23:28.594 --> 23:29.515
I know, right?

23:29.540 --> 23:31.111
Shut up.

23:31.136 --> 23:32.559
<i>The Incredible Hulk #102</i> ?

23:32.583 --> 23:33.645
You're amazing! That...

23:33.670 --> 23:35.706
No, you're... Yes.

23:35.731 --> 23:37.230
And funny. Yeah.

23:37.255 --> 23:39.518
Um... (whispers) Sorry. Just...

23:39.543 --> 23:40.723
one second.

23:40.748 --> 23:42.355
Nina, you're... You're
kinda breaking up.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.568
Can... can you hear me?

23:43.594 --> 23:44.594
Nina?

23:45.572 --> 23:48.607
Hi. I was wondering
if you could help me.

23:48.632 --> 23:50.757
I'd like to talk to a
scientist named Jamie B.

23:50.782 --> 23:52.305
He works in nanotechnology.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.601
Excuse me.

23:53.627 --> 23:56.254
I overheard you. I'm Jamison Barrett,

23:56.279 --> 23:58.651
- but people call me...
- Jamie B.

23:58.676 --> 24:01.089
How do you know about
our nanobot initiative?

24:01.115 --> 24:02.797
We need to talk.

24:02.822 --> 24:05.214
Let's go to my office.

24:05.239 --> 24:07.844
Okay. Anytime after 8:30 works for me,
if that's cool with you.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.495
Great.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.706
All right. Okay. Bye.

24:14.531 --> 24:16.917
Where the...

24:17.711 --> 24:20.390
I was lead bio-engineer
on the hydrocarbon team

24:20.415 --> 24:23.349
and only had peripheral
involvement with the nanobot group.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.750
I'm not sure what I can help you with.

24:25.775 --> 24:28.271
Who is that next to you in the picture?

24:31.163 --> 24:33.852
That's Dr. Steven Benning.

24:34.490 --> 24:36.868
He... he used to work here?

24:37.693 --> 24:39.644
Until he disappeared.

24:39.669 --> 24:41.561
It's been over a year.

24:41.673 --> 24:43.695
What happened to him?

24:44.351 --> 24:46.955
We don't know for sure.

24:47.535 --> 24:49.648
His car was found on PCH,

24:49.673 --> 24:51.521
but he never turned up anywhere.

24:51.546 --> 24:55.570
Never went to his house,
never touched his bank accounts.

24:56.677 --> 24:58.579
Steve had been stressed at work,

24:58.604 --> 25:01.096
so the police think he simply took off.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.998
Ran away from his life.

25:05.437 --> 25:09.062
I guess that's why it's still
difficult for me to process.

25:09.476 --> 25:11.780
Who are you?

25:15.946 --> 25:18.259
Why are you talking to Dr. Barrett?

25:18.284 --> 25:22.397
Actually,
it's you that I really want to talk to.

25:22.451 --> 25:25.749
I'm a big fan of nanobot technology

25:25.774 --> 25:28.992
and complex encryption coding.

25:29.017 --> 25:32.223
Dr. Barrett, the strategic
planning session is starting.

25:32.248 --> 25:34.457
You should go.

25:39.863 --> 25:42.780
Okay, who are you and what do you want?

25:42.805 --> 25:44.809
I have the encryption
code that you need to open

25:44.834 --> 25:47.385
the nanobot storage device
Dr. Benning locked up.

25:47.410 --> 25:49.441
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:49.954 --> 25:51.704
Okay.

25:52.324 --> 25:55.154
(writing)

25:56.331 --> 25:58.478
Call me if you happen to get an idea

25:58.503 --> 25:59.547
and you want to make a deal.

25:59.572 --> 26:01.550
I can find my way out.

26:06.010 --> 26:08.460
<i>♪ Rrr, I rip it like chainsaw ♪</i>

26:08.485 --> 26:10.274
<i>♪ Respect, that's what I came for ♪</i>

26:10.299 --> 26:12.262
<i>♪ Just keep the jaws dropping ♪</i>

26:12.288 --> 26:14.972
Millie! What's up?

26:15.962 --> 26:17.300
You're early.

26:17.325 --> 26:18.477
Yeah, I was hungry.

26:18.502 --> 26:21.081
<i>Su casa es mi casa</i>, right?

26:21.106 --> 26:24.618
No, no.<i> Mi casa es mi casa.</i>

26:24.643 --> 26:26.552
Touch that and I'll end you.

26:27.184 --> 26:28.910
Give Linus his stuff back.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.768
Ooh, not gonna happen.

26:30.793 --> 26:33.150
So, why don't you tell your boy toy

26:33.175 --> 26:37.265
that having you fight his
battle didn't work out so good.

26:37.425 --> 26:38.686
Theo.

26:38.711 --> 26:40.776
And while you're at it,
tell Linus he should

26:40.801 --> 26:43.765
thank me for teaching
him to be less trusting.

26:43.790 --> 26:44.960
You're out of toilet paper.

26:44.985 --> 26:46.028
Okay.

26:46.743 --> 26:51.776
Get up, get Linus'
stuff back to him. Now.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.428
Who does she think she is?

26:54.453 --> 26:55.914
Giving me orders.

26:55.939 --> 26:57.483
(laughs)

26:58.050 --> 26:59.422
Yeah.

26:59.447 --> 27:01.815
Who do I think I am?

27:03.441 --> 27:05.679
(gasps)

27:07.456 --> 27:10.270
I think I'm NSA, bitch.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.532
<i>♪ You're not ready for the new beat ♪</i>

27:12.557 --> 27:15.508
FYI, Jamie B., our Jamie B.,

27:15.533 --> 27:18.089
was actually Dr. Steven Benning.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.465
He was the head of MeriCorp Energy's

27:19.490 --> 27:21.029
nanobot program,

27:21.054 --> 27:24.755
and Jamie B. is really
Dr. Jamison Barrett.

27:24.780 --> 27:26.610
The woman you spoke with today

27:26.635 --> 27:28.819
without me even though I
was literally right there?

27:28.844 --> 27:29.830
Oh...

27:29.855 --> 27:32.892
Wait, like,
you mean when you were talking to Nina?

27:32.917 --> 27:35.014
Nina works at a comic book store.

27:35.039 --> 27:36.038
She was calling about an order.

27:36.063 --> 27:36.917
Whatever.

27:36.942 --> 27:39.861
Anyway,
I think Dr. Benning took Jamie B.'s name

27:39.886 --> 27:41.477
because even though he
forget everything else,

27:41.502 --> 27:42.786
he could never forget her.

27:42.811 --> 27:44.617
(phone rings)

27:47.183 --> 27:48.525
Linus. Hey.

27:48.550 --> 27:50.454
I reviewed the security
camera footage you got.

27:50.479 --> 27:52.137
I went through it frame by frame

27:52.162 --> 27:53.874
at the exact time you said.

27:53.899 --> 27:55.488
All I see is Jamie B.

27:55.513 --> 27:57.267
Helping a lady with her groceries,

27:57.292 --> 27:59.780
but there's no boy in a red hat there.

27:59.805 --> 28:02.486
But that's impossible. I know I
saw him in two different stitches.

28:02.511 --> 28:04.748
- Check it again.
- I've already done that.

28:04.773 --> 28:06.562
Do it again. He's gotta be there.

28:06.587 --> 28:07.541
Please.

28:07.566 --> 28:09.957
(sighs) Okay.

28:11.596 --> 28:13.560
He was there. I know he was.

28:13.585 --> 28:15.170
(phone rings)

28:16.041 --> 28:17.589
Hello?

28:17.614 --> 28:20.391
Naomi: <i>Let's make the deal.</i>

28:23.170 --> 28:25.661
Kirsten told Naomi Burke
about the encryption code

28:25.686 --> 28:27.118
and made a deal to give it to her.

28:27.143 --> 28:29.648
It's a smart move. If we can get
Burke to offer us money for it...

28:29.673 --> 28:30.944
We can turn around and arrest her.

28:30.969 --> 28:33.418
Burke and the security guard
have already killed a man.

28:33.443 --> 28:35.493
- Twice.
- She's not gonna hand over money

28:35.529 --> 28:37.021
without proof the code works.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.940
Yeah, but we can't prove
it without cracking it.

28:38.965 --> 28:41.145
Any idea what kind of
encryption key Benning used?

28:41.170 --> 28:43.101
Yeah, a 2048-bit SSL key.

28:43.126 --> 28:43.997
- Oof.
- (groans)

28:44.022 --> 28:46.228
You guys are geniuses.
How hard can it be to crack

28:46.253 --> 28:48.019
a 2048 character code?

28:48.044 --> 28:50.329
Well, using a conventional computer,

28:50.354 --> 28:53.471
only 400,000 times longer
than the universe has existed.

28:53.496 --> 28:55.410
But with the help of
our quantum computer,

28:55.435 --> 28:56.920
we can do it in half the time.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.696
Kay, not geniuses.

28:58.721 --> 28:59.898
But Dr. Benning was.

28:59.923 --> 29:01.141
We just need to think like him.

29:01.166 --> 29:03.703
I heard music in Benning's memory

29:03.728 --> 29:05.115
when he was programming the code.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.060
Well, music is mathematical.
Do you remember the song?

29:07.247 --> 29:08.330
Not well.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.089
Just fire up the old temporal dysplasia.

29:10.114 --> 29:11.230
(scoffs)

29:11.255 --> 29:14.339
Hello, I'm not a walking DVR
player anymore, remember?

29:14.364 --> 29:15.909
I can't just replay memories.

29:15.934 --> 29:18.771
Do you at least remember
what kind of music it was?

29:18.796 --> 29:20.744
Jazz. I... It sounded like jazz.

29:20.769 --> 29:23.280
- Okay then. Idea.
- What are you searching for?

29:23.305 --> 29:25.705
Jazz songs with exactly 2,048 notes.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.110
Maybe Benning used the
song as the encryption key.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.291
Oh, what? There are four possibilities.

29:31.316 --> 29:33.092
Okay, let me hear 'em.

29:33.117 --> 29:34.697
<i>(jazz music plays)</i>

29:34.722 --> 29:36.332
No.

29:36.637 --> 29:38.623
<i>(jazz music plays)</i>

29:38.648 --> 29:40.286
No.

29:41.045 --> 29:42.778
<i>(jazz music plays)</i>

29:42.803 --> 29:44.453
That's it. That's the song.

29:44.478 --> 29:48.132
<i>Kiss me Now</i>,
recorded in 1949 by Cal Metzinger.

29:48.474 --> 29:51.085
I'll upload <i> Kiss Me Now</i>
to the quantum computer,

29:51.110 --> 29:54.545
I'll reprogram it to convert
all 2,048 musical notes

29:54.570 --> 29:56.451
on the chromatic scale to
the corresponding numbers,

29:56.476 --> 29:57.866
- and...
- (beep)

29:57.891 --> 29:58.727
Bam!

29:58.752 --> 30:00.424
We got ourselves an encryption key.

30:00.449 --> 30:02.684
- I just...
- Okay, maybe geniuses.

30:02.709 --> 30:03.624
Thank you so much.

30:03.649 --> 30:05.967
Then we can download the code
from the quantum computer

30:05.992 --> 30:08.491
onto a flash drive so
I can sell it to Naomi.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.698
Wait a sec. We are talking
about a code that could unlock

30:10.723 --> 30:12.527
a horde of flesh-eating nanobots.

30:12.552 --> 30:14.057
Okay? What if something goes wrong?

30:14.082 --> 30:16.333
Cameron's right.
I'm not gonna send you out there cold.

30:16.358 --> 30:20.207
You know, our quantum
computer uses nanobots, right?

30:20.384 --> 30:23.459
If Dr. Benning
reprogrammed his nanobots,

30:23.484 --> 30:25.534
why can't we reprogram ours?

30:25.559 --> 30:28.592
(gasps) To do what?

30:30.690 --> 30:33.196
Oh, man. I really wish
Kirsten wore a wire.

30:34.414 --> 30:36.554
Naomi'd be expecting that though.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.131
We got eyes on her. We should be good.

30:38.156 --> 30:39.447
As soon as the exchange is made,
we'll grab her.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.472
All right.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.849
(sighs)

30:44.686 --> 30:46.799
(sighs)

30:49.246 --> 30:50.945
Yo, Fish...

30:50.971 --> 30:55.416
so... hypothetically, if a...
if a guy wanted to...

30:55.865 --> 30:57.967
you know, bust out of the friend zone

30:57.992 --> 30:58.940
before it's too late...

30:58.965 --> 31:00.895
God, not more relationship advice.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.405
But the girl's not even
sure she likes me...

31:05.356 --> 31:06.356
and...

31:06.409 --> 31:07.860
And you want to know
if this connection is

31:07.897 --> 31:09.427
actual love or a really deep friendship?

31:09.452 --> 31:11.024
- Is that it?
- (sighs)

31:11.049 --> 31:12.632
Yeah.

31:12.657 --> 31:14.073
I don't know, buddy.

31:14.098 --> 31:16.065
It's different for everyone.

31:16.090 --> 31:18.739
But what I can tell you
from personal experience,

31:18.764 --> 31:21.526
some people make better
friends than they do couples.

31:21.551 --> 31:24.102
(inhales deeply)

31:24.656 --> 31:26.984
Now put your game face on. Naomi's here.

31:28.456 --> 31:30.622
(phone beeping)

31:33.323 --> 31:34.914
I'm not wired.

31:35.316 --> 31:38.214
You can never be too safe.

31:38.416 --> 31:40.302
You have no idea the lengths

31:40.327 --> 31:42.269
people will go to steal
corporate secrets.

31:42.294 --> 31:44.210
Oh, I can imagine.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.283
Which is why I'm curious.

31:46.308 --> 31:48.473
How did you acquire the encryption key?

31:48.498 --> 31:49.806
That's my business.

31:49.831 --> 31:51.700
And are we making a deal or not?

31:52.494 --> 31:54.340
I'm always happy to help another woman

31:54.365 --> 31:56.233
get her slice of the American pie.

31:56.369 --> 31:57.828
You have my key?

31:57.853 --> 31:59.195
You have my pie?

31:59.350 --> 32:02.446
Actually, there's an alley out back.

32:02.471 --> 32:04.504
It's a little less public.

32:05.642 --> 32:07.410
I like public.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.500
I'm going.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.848
Dude, something's wrong.
She's not making the exchange.

32:14.873 --> 32:17.457
Come with me, and we make the deal.

32:18.099 --> 32:21.751
Stay here, and enjoy your dinner.

32:24.614 --> 32:28.953
Wait. Look.

32:32.090 --> 32:33.947
Okay. Let's give her a minute.

32:33.972 --> 32:35.736
We've gotta trust her.

32:38.047 --> 32:41.147
Here's mine. Now show me yours.

32:42.318 --> 32:44.583
Not so fast.

32:44.608 --> 32:46.484
I need to make sure the code works.

32:46.509 --> 32:48.540
The device is at the lab.

32:49.391 --> 32:51.453
Let's take a ride.

32:51.478 --> 32:53.481
Then you'll get your money.

Okay, dude, something's wrong.

33:00.572 --> 33:02.167
How long does it take

33:02.192 --> 33:03.399
I agree. Let's go.

36:11.732 --> 36:14.011
Naomi, what's going on?

36:15.606 --> 36:19.377
Dr. Benning mistakenly
reprogrammed the nanobots

36:19.402 --> 36:20.602
to consume carbon-based material.

36:20.627 --> 36:22.950
Naomi here decided to
turn it into weapon.

36:23.907 --> 36:26.057
That's why she killed him.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.328

36:28.353 --> 36:29.758
Get in.

36:29.783 --> 36:32.016

that if these nanobots

36:32.041 --> 36:33.701
were released into the
world that everything,

36:33.726 --> 36:37.373
including both of you,

36:45.252 --> 36:47.817

See, what you're feeling
right now are my nanobots

36:52.081 --> 36:55.341
building stronger connections
between the synapses in your brains.

36:55.365 --> 36:57.191
Unfortunately for you,

36:57.216 --> 37:00.603
your synapses don't need
stronger connections,

37:00.628 --> 37:02.183
so your brains are short-circuiting.

37:02.209 --> 37:03.144
(both gasping, wailing)

37:03.169 --> 37:04.966
But don't worry, the bots are programmed

37:04.991 --> 37:06.518
to stop after a few hours.

37:06.543 --> 37:08.710
You have nanobots?

37:08.735 --> 37:09.834
Sure.

37:09.859 --> 37:12.476
Doesn't everybody?

37:15.759 --> 37:17.779
We infected the USB drive

37:17.804 --> 37:19.043
with our nanobots.

37:19.068 --> 37:20.138
When they both handled it,

37:20.163 --> 37:22.436
the nanobots entered their
bodies through their skin.

37:22.461 --> 37:24.495
But they didn't affect you.

37:24.520 --> 37:28.259
We reprogrammed our
nanobots to avoid my DNA.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.830
They're still unconscious,

37:34.855 --> 37:36.435
but I'm told they should be fine.

37:36.459 --> 37:39.305

be. They killed Steve.

37:48.303 --> 37:51.582
I mean, after he forgot who he was.

37:51.607 --> 37:52.999
He was a good person.

37:53.024 --> 37:57.179
He was kind and loving
and he never forgot you.

37:57.204 --> 38:00.371
He kept a notebook and
wrote your name in it

we thought his name was Jamie B.

You're my best friend.

39:10.427 --> 39:15.376
<i>♪ I didn't have to see you go ♪</i>

39:18.451 --> 39:20.659
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:20.684 --> 39:22.635
Okay.

39:26.533 --> 39:30.829
<i>♪ I didn't have to see you go ♪</i>

39:31.529 --> 39:34.093
(sighs)

39:35.741 --> 39:37.985
(giggling)

39:38.383 --> 39:41.835
- (clang)
- Camille: Ooh! Shh! Shh!

39:41.860 --> 39:42.975
(giggling)

39:43.000 --> 39:44.538
Oh...

39:44.562 --> 39:48.002
(knocking)

39:54.908 --> 39:56.190
Nina!

39:56.216 --> 39:57.794
- (crashing)
- Uh...

39:57.818 --> 40:02.179
May I present <i>The Incredible Hulk #102.</i>

40:02.204 --> 40:04.651
Wow. This... this is...
This is a big moment.

40:04.676 --> 40:05.758
Historic.

40:05.783 --> 40:09.511
You are now the envy of fanboys
and fangirls everywhere.

40:09.536 --> 40:10.876
(chuckles)

40:11.472 --> 40:13.165
Please.

40:13.773 --> 40:15.961
Oh, man. Thank you.

40:15.986 --> 40:18.631
And thank you for bringing it over.

40:18.656 --> 40:19.738
You're a very lucky guy.

40:19.763 --> 40:23.188
A chance like this comes
once in a lifetime.

40:23.923 --> 40:26.673
What are you... what are you doing now?

40:26.698 --> 40:28.781
You mean besides
delivering the Holy Grail

40:28.806 --> 40:29.914
to a fellow comic book nerd?

40:29.939 --> 40:31.589
- (chuckles)
- Nothing.

40:31.614 --> 40:33.495
You wanna get something to eat?

40:33.762 --> 40:35.632
U... unless... unless it's too late.

40:35.657 --> 40:37.170
It's not too late.

40:37.195 --> 40:38.962
Not yet anyway.

40:41.727 --> 40:44.983
So I heard back from the tailor's son.

40:45.008 --> 40:47.709
His father died five years ago.

40:47.734 --> 40:49.089
Fisher: <i>Did he leave any records?</i>

40:49.114 --> 40:51.969
No. It's another dead end.

40:51.993 --> 40:54.672
<i>Mm. All right.
Well, don't get discouraged, kiddo.</i>

40:54.697 --> 40:56.973
<i>You're smart.
You'll find a different way to go.</i>

40:57.055 --> 40:58.004
Right.

40:58.029 --> 41:00.396
<i>Kirsten, you did good today.</i>

41:00.421 --> 41:02.097
<i>Today was a win.</i>

41:02.122 --> 41:04.601
Thanks, Fisher.

41:25.116 --> 41:29.351
