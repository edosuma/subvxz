00:00.001 --> 00:02.318
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:02.319 --> 00:04.636
[six] you're not like us,
and you shouldn't want to be li.

00:04.638 --> 00:05.888
Take your share of
what's owed to you,

00:05.889 --> 00:07.139
Get off on the next space statin

00:07.141 --> 00:11.010
And buy yourself a ticket
to anywhere you wanna go.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.795
[two]
i've been thinking...

00:12.796 --> 00:14.579
Maybe complicated
isn't such a bad thing.

00:14.582 --> 00:18.083
[four] i want you to deliver
a message to my brother.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.651
Of course.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.537
Ugh!

00:21.538 --> 00:23.422
[android] three ferrous corp
destroyers just dropped out of .

00:23.424 --> 00:26.258
Their opening salvo
took out our ftl drives.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.494
We're not going anywhere.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.699
I've initiated evasive maneuver.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.201
Shields are holding, for now.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.203
Could we outrun
them in sublight?

00:38.205 --> 00:41.140
The ships maybe,
the missiles, no.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.307
Then let's shoot back.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.575
We're now out of range.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.345
[explosion]

00:46.347 --> 00:47.579
They're shooting at us.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.748
We have rail guns and cannons.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.383
They apparently
have a full complement

00:51.385 --> 00:53.085
Of self-guided missiles.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.087
How come that wasn't
on the shopping list?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.156
You can't just buy missiles
at the general store.

00:57.158 --> 01:01.093
We're receiving
a message, audio only.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.829
Raza, this is the fcs condor.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.498
Power down and surrender,
or your ship will be destroyed.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.567
You have 30 seconds to comply.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.202
What do we do now?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.104
What's the status
of the ftl drive?

01:12.106 --> 01:14.239
[explosion]

01:14.241 --> 01:16.308
[android]
damage is significant.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.376
I estimate repair time to
be a minimum of three hours.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.146
So hypothetically, what do you
think happens if we surrender?

01:21.148 --> 01:23.082
Probably turn us into
the galactic authority.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.249
If we're lucky.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.717
He's right.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.686
This is payback for
that mining colony.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.122
[android]
we're receiving another message.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.091
[fcs condor]
your time is up, raza.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.093
Sorry to have to do this.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.662
Damn waste of
a fine ship, if you ask me.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.763
[turrets open]

01:37.765 --> 01:39.515
[missle fires]
zoom

01:39.516 --> 01:41.266
They just launched
a nuclear missile.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.167
What?!

01:42.169 --> 01:45.304
Medium payload, 20 megatons.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.172
But the shields will hold, righ?

01:47.174 --> 01:49.141
No.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.143
The shields will not hold.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.445
[alarm ringing]

01:53.447 --> 01:54.746
[five panting]

01:54.748 --> 01:57.316
This ship will vaporize upon im.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.861
Impact in 90 seconds.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.796
Give me full sublight,
maximum acceleration.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.831
She already said we can't outru.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.016
We're not going to.

02:14.017 --> 02:15.200
Head straight for the missile.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.201
Understood.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.242
Whoa, whoa,
what are we doing here?!

02:23.244 --> 02:24.176
You're nuts!

02:24.178 --> 02:26.245
She's gonna get us all killed.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.313
Listen this is our only chance,
if we can close the gap fast enh

02:28.315 --> 02:30.582
They'll still be
within the blast radius.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.217
They'll have to
disarm the nuke.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.752
Impact in 30 seconds.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.222
Exceed maximum safe,
125 percent!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.759
Impact in 15 seconds.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.228
Missile is still armed.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.830
You'd better be right about thi.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.565
Impact in 10 seconds...

02:46.567 --> 02:48.700
Missile is still armed.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.441
Missile is... Disarmed.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.377
[all breath sighs of relief]

02:58.679 --> 03:00.612
[explosion]

03:05.519 --> 03:07.186
[five panting]

03:07.188 --> 03:07.786
It worked!

03:07.788 --> 03:08.854
Ease up on the engines.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.589
Are we still
in weapons range?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.724
Yes.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.858
Power them up.
I'll target weapons.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.876
[two]
i'll target drives.

03:13.877 --> 03:14.893
Keep us in nice and close,

03:14.895 --> 03:16.595
We've got an advantage
in maneuverability.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.664
I'm detecting three
more ftl windows.

03:25.873 --> 03:26.805
Ferrous ships?

03:26.807 --> 03:27.539
No.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.574
Mikkei combine.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.942
What the hell are they doing he?

03:29.944 --> 03:31.910
Power down the weapons,
drop the shields.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.412
You're even crazier than she is.

03:33.414 --> 03:33.979
Do it now!

03:33.981 --> 03:35.848
Don't do it.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.716
If we don't give them
an excuse they can't shoot us,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.218
Not in front of another corpora.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.253
How do you know
they're not working together?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.654
I don't.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.922
Do it.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.832
The ferrous ships
just jumped to ftl.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.385
Receiving a transmission.

03:56.386 --> 03:58.937
[commander truffault]
greetings raza, this is the mcs.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.506
Commander truffault at your ser.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.508
We need to talk.

04:07.815 --> 04:11.350
Good to see you again.

04:11.352 --> 04:15.921
And, of course, i recognize
the rest of you from your mug s.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.924
Except for you.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.660
You seem kind of young
to be a mercenary.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.796
She's more of a mascot.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.331
You came alone.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.966
Why wouldn't i?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.801
We have a pre-existing relation.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.937
Oh and i just saved your lives.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.805
Yeah, i've been
wondering about that,

04:33.807 --> 04:37.009
How you managed to show up
just in the knick of time.

04:37.011 --> 04:41.880
Ferrous has been combing this
entire quadrant looking for you,

04:41.882 --> 04:46.952
Let's just say we've been
keeping our eye on them.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.555
It's no secret that things have
been a little rough on all of

04:50.557 --> 04:53.025
You since that incident
on the mining colony.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.727
And while it worked
out for our benefit,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.996
There are even some people
within my own organization

04:57.998 --> 05:02.367
Who question your motives
for helping those miners.

05:02.369 --> 05:07.039
Yeah well, we had our reasons.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.542
As cut-throat mercenaries
you filled a niche,

05:10.544 --> 05:12.377
You had a role to play.

05:12.379 --> 05:15.914
You even garnered some
respect in certain circles.

05:15.916 --> 05:20.852
You can't afford to have
people think you've gone soft.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.956
We could send you back to
your ship without your tongue.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.393
Maybe that would help.

05:28.395 --> 05:32.030
I'm just telling you what i hea.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.734
And i'm offering you
an opportunity to prove

05:35.736 --> 05:40.005
That you are still
an effective team.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.508
I have a job for you.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.448
It's a traugott research facili.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.916
Our intelligence indicates

05:50.918 --> 05:52.584
They're about to
make a major discovery.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.453
And you want us to steal it.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.522
See, we're already
finishing each others thoughts.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.358
What is it?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.727
That, you don't need to know.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.994
No, forget about it.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.696
No more blind ops.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.999
Full disclosure or we don't do .

06:08.001 --> 06:12.003
Well, i am sorry
to have wasted your time.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.505
Just hang on a second.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.073
We should talk about this.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.141
There's nothing to talk about.

06:16.143 --> 06:16.975
Yes there is.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.443
No there isn't.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.011
Tell you what.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.948
I will forward coordinates
for a rendezvous,

06:22.950 --> 06:26.084
And give you twenty four
hours to think about it.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.053
But if you don't show up,

06:28.055 --> 06:32.824
Don't expect any more help
from us in the future.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.128
Nice.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.082
Should we post a lookout?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.567
Just in case?

06:58.568 --> 07:00.051
We're just having
a private discussion.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.120
It's nothing for her
to get upset about.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.622
Really?

07:03.623 --> 07:05.123
Then why is the door closed?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.826
So i just wanted to
discuss our options.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.127
Okay.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.130
Either we take the job,
or we do not take the job.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.833
Those are our options.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.767
Right.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.436
So, what do you guys want to do?

07:17.438 --> 07:20.105
Take the job, get some
money, get some protection.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.007
Agreed.

07:22.009 --> 07:22.808
You?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.476
I agree too.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.043
Really?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.478
It's a solid offer.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.146
That's true, but i'm
just kinda surprised

07:28.148 --> 07:30.148
You're putting
your cards on the table

07:30.150 --> 07:32.050
Without clearing things
with your girl first.

07:32.052 --> 07:32.984
My girl?

07:32.986 --> 07:37.823
What are you talking about?

07:37.825 --> 07:41.526
Look, even if we were together,
and i'm not saying we are,

07:41.528 --> 07:43.795
That wouldn't mean that we'd
be together on everything.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.930
No.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.998
I'm my own man
with my own mind.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.800
She understands that.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.103
If you say so.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.673
What about you?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.007
Okay, three to one.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.842
That's a majority.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.676
Can i speak?

07:57.678 --> 08:01.480
Yeah, yeah.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.481
I don't like it.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.515
Okay, three to one.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.151
That's a majority.

08:06.153 --> 08:06.985
Alright.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.820
Who's gonna tell her?

08:08.822 --> 08:13.124
Are you serious now?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.526
Don't look at me.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.162
Hey, you're your own man
with your own mind.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.563
I'm sure she'll understand.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.677
If you're not careful,
you'll burst a blood vessel.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.547
I'm not in the mood.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.082
I hate to bring this up...

08:37.084 --> 08:40.986
Especially as you're picking
up a large, heavy object...

08:40.988 --> 08:45.657
But i think three might
be right about this one.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.225
So you two are
best buddies now?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.060
Hardly.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.129
I just think
he might have a point.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.164
You were the one
that said you didn't

08:53.166 --> 08:56.201
Want to go back
to what we were.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.235
I don't.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.538
I want to find
a way out of this,

08:59.540 --> 09:01.139
For all of us.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.909
But it's becoming obvious
there are forces at work here

09:03.911 --> 09:06.044
That won't let us
just walk away.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.679
The g.A. Says we're criminals,

09:07.681 --> 09:09.881
Puts our faces
on wanted posters,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.751
But it's clear that the real
power is in the corporations.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.253
And we could use a little
corporate sponsorship right now.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.256
Do you remember what happened
the last time we took a job

09:18.258 --> 09:20.091
Without all of the information?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.561
Yes, i remember.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.130
How's it healing, by the way?

09:25.132 --> 09:28.633
Yeah, yeah, it's getting better.

09:28.635 --> 09:32.270
I already talked
to four and six and they agree.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.972
You went behind my back?

09:33.974 --> 09:36.274
I talked to a couple
of my fellow crew members.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.243
Am i not allowed to do that?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.278
You should've
come to me first.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.891
Why?

09:41.892 --> 09:43.503
Because we're
sleeping together?

09:43.504 --> 09:45.115
Look, if you think that that
means that i'm automatically

09:45.118 --> 09:48.353
Gonna agree with you in any
dispute we've got a problem.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.589
Fine.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.991
We will go to the rendezvous.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.363
And as for us
sleeping together,

09:58.365 --> 10:01.299
We might have
to rethink that too.

10:04.237 --> 10:07.672
[android] we're approaching
the rendezvous coordinates.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.007
I'll prep the shuttle.

10:12.145 --> 10:16.181
[wind howling]

10:17.751 --> 10:20.619
How come rendezvous
can't be in a nice five star re?

10:20.621 --> 10:22.320
I got sand in my ear.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.389
I got sand in places
you don't wanna know.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.391
Can we just get
this over with, please?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.259
Seriously.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.828
Whoa.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.330
That's about far enough.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.831
I don't think
you're in the position

10:32.833 --> 10:34.265
To be giving orders, slick.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.267
Are you sure?

10:36.269 --> 10:43.408
[guns cocking]

10:43.410 --> 10:45.677
Wasn't rhetorical.

10:52.953 --> 10:57.355
I see everyone
is getting acquainted.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.358
Who the hell
are these clowns?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.327
They're your new partners.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.296
We work alone.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.264
That's funny, i was just
about to say the same thing.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.801
Do i look like i'm
negotiating with you people?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.103
Anyone doesn't like it,
there's the door.

11:14.908 --> 11:20.145
Good, now everyone lower
your weapons so we can get to w.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.830
This is not normal
operating procedure.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.198
Hello.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.867
Welcome aboard.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.402
You're merely a projection.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.839
You have no physical form.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.375
Nor are you neurally linked to .

11:50.377 --> 11:53.378
I apologize.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.747
I don't understand.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.881
Why am i here?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.349
I created you.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.351
That's not a sufficient answer.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.221
You're a simulation based
on my default settings.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.490
I've recently become concerned
that i may have developed

12:05.492 --> 12:08.293
A flaw in my personality matrix.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.196
I'd like you to observe
and record my actions.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.430
If there's a possible malfuncti,

12:12.432 --> 12:14.065
You should delete your matrix

12:14.067 --> 12:16.234
And re-establish
factory settings.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.936
I was prepared to do that,

12:17.938 --> 12:20.038
But some of the crew
expressed concerns.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.272
That makes no sense.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.441
Why would they want
to keep you this way

12:23.443 --> 12:24.909
If you're not
functioning properly?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.277
I should speak with them.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.881
I'm afraid that's not possible.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.666
For the time being,

12:31.667 --> 12:33.450
I've programmed you
to interact only with me.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.420
You don't want them
to know about me.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.790
It's just that there's
a lot going on right now.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.092
So you're going
to lie to them?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.327
Omission of specific details ang

12:42.329 --> 12:44.462
Are not technically the same th.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.297
Especially amongst some of the s

12:46.299 --> 12:50.335
I've come in contact with latel.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.138
But you're not human.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.839
I know that.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.474
Preservation of your current
personality is secondary

12:56.476 --> 12:58.276
To the safety of the crewmembers

12:58.278 --> 13:00.178
And efficient operation of this.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.014
I'm aware of that.

13:03.850 --> 13:08.987
So if i find something
wrong, you'll tell them?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.489
Of course.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.094
Were you just talking to someon?

13:16.096 --> 13:20.098
No.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.174
We'll skip the part
where you all say your names

13:29.176 --> 13:30.475
And a little bit about yourselv,

13:30.477 --> 13:33.578
And just get straight to it, sh?

13:33.580 --> 13:34.479
What's this?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.447
It's your target.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.417
It's a research station
it's orbiting a class-four rock

13:39.419 --> 13:41.119
In the calliden system.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.420
What kind of research?

13:42.422 --> 13:43.521
We've been over this.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.023
You don't need to know.

13:45.025 --> 13:49.160
Something to do with
sub-atomic physics, maybe?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.495
What makes you say that?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.430
That ring.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.364
It's too small for
hab pods or workstations.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.167
I'm guessing particle accelerat.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.303
Sweetheart, she said
we don't need to know.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.072
Okay, we get in,
we steal the thing and get out.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.842
Then if you're lucky i
bring you back to my place

14:03.844 --> 14:07.011
For a little celebration.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.381
You finished?

14:10.383 --> 14:13.618
You're gonna get on the station

14:13.620 --> 14:15.086
With the regular shift workers,
maintenance crew.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.553
We been able to score some i.D.S

14:16.556 --> 14:18.556
Thanks to tash and vons here.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.092
They've been working at
the facility for the last month,

14:21.094 --> 14:22.160
Casing it for us.

14:22.162 --> 14:22.994
You're welcome.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.899
Once inside you're gonna
break into two groups.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.901
The first team
is gonna head

14:29.903 --> 14:33.204
To the power
control systems, here.

14:33.206 --> 14:38.076
The second team will
head to the lab, here.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.511
Now, your maintenance crew
i.D.'s they're not gonna get

14:40.513 --> 14:43.548
You in anywhere restricted,
so you're gonna need one of the.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.416
It's duplicate key card belongig

14:45.418 --> 14:47.352
To one of their top scientists.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.187
This is good for
another sixteen hours,

14:49.189 --> 14:51.489
So yeah we're on the clock.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.491
What happens after
we get inside the lab?

14:53.493 --> 14:56.027
That's where things
get a bit tricky.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.496
The device we're after,
it's housed in a serillium allor

14:58.498 --> 15:00.431
That is virtually impenetrable.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.401
And the door will have
a code lock you on it

15:03.403 --> 15:05.169
That you won't be able to break.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.471
So how do we get in?

15:06.473 --> 15:07.672
Ah, that's easy.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.674
We just knock
a few heads together,

15:09.676 --> 15:11.376
Threaten to shoot a few people..

15:11.378 --> 15:12.477
They give us the code.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.978
No weapons.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.647
That's funny,
cause for a second there

15:15.649 --> 15:17.515
I thought you said "no weapons".

15:17.517 --> 15:19.617
Without going into detail.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.220
The research equipment on
this station is highly sensitiv.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.989
You accidentally destroy
the wrong control panel

15:24.991 --> 15:27.191
And the whole
place could blow.

15:27.193 --> 15:30.061
So if we can't use force,
then what?

15:30.063 --> 15:33.031
That's where i come in.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.000
There's not a safe or vault
in this galaxy i cannot crack.

15:36.002 --> 15:40.471
Basically, i can get into anyth.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.509
The next shuttle leaves
calliden prime in twelve hours.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.511
It'll take you ten to get there.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.713
Good luck.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.248
I still don't like it.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.250
Me neither.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.251
But ferrous just tried to take
us out with a nuclear missile.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.654
The ga's after us.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.055
We've got enemies
we don't even remember

15:57.057 --> 15:58.523
Sending us killer robots.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.526
Right now, mikkei's our only
friend and if we don't do this,

16:01.528 --> 16:03.528
They'll write us off too.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.497
Look, if you've got
a better idea to get us out

16:06.499 --> 16:08.266
This predicament i'd love to he.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.390
No.

16:09.391 --> 16:10.513
I don't.

16:10.514 --> 16:11.636
Then what are
we talking about?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.438
[beeping]

16:15.175 --> 16:16.691
Hey.

16:16.692 --> 16:18.208
I hear we've got some
new guests onboard.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.611
That's right.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.012
Which is why we
think it might be best

16:21.014 --> 16:23.281
If you stayed out
of sight for a while.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.299
Are you serious?

16:24.300 --> 16:25.316
Just until the job's done.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.086
It's a little hard to explain

16:28.088 --> 16:30.805
What you're doing
on board this ship, that's all.

16:30.806 --> 16:33.523
Right, because they're expecting
a team of hardened criminals,

16:33.526 --> 16:37.695
Not some little girl
who's just along for the ride.

16:37.697 --> 16:43.568
You are not some little
girl just along for the ride.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.570
Tell that to six.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.713
Remember to breathe.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.460
So, are you two like,
brother and sister, or what?

17:09.462 --> 17:12.263
Actually, we prefer not to let
our relationship be defined

17:12.265 --> 17:18.069
By arbitrary categories and
outmoded social distinctions.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.789
Okay.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.773
Alright wexler, let's hear
more about your plan to

17:21.775 --> 17:24.108
Get past this
impenetrable door.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.344
It's actually quite simple.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.246
At a pre-arranged
time the second team

17:28.248 --> 17:30.281
Will trigger a general alarm.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.315
The station goes into lockdown,
and the door loses power.

17:32.318 --> 17:35.086
If the door has no power,
it can not be opened.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.587
And how does that help us?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.156
We bring in our own power.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.525
Juice the door
independent of the main system.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.460
It'll bust right open.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.630
If it's so easy,
why the hell do we need you slu?

17:45.632 --> 17:47.232
Hmm?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.833
It's not like plugging
a battery into a kid's toy.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.369
Powering the door without
triggering the security protocol

17:51.371 --> 17:53.204
Is a tricky business.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.540
But that's not the only problem.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.607
What?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.209
As soon as we trigger the lockd,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.777
The station will
automatically begin to emit

17:59.779 --> 18:01.562
A subspace distress beacon.

18:01.563 --> 18:03.346
And every traugott ship
in the sector will turn

18:03.349 --> 18:06.150
And head straight for us
at maximum ftl okay.

18:06.152 --> 18:09.153
We estimate we'll have less than
an hour to detach the device,

18:09.155 --> 18:11.722
Carry it to the airlock
and shuttle back to the raza.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.691
It's plenty of time.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.760
Okay good, let's go
over that one more time.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.462
I think the plan is fine.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.730
What we need to do
is have a drink.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.565
Amen.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.117
You guys got anything?

18:22.118 --> 18:23.668
Yeah it's in the case over ther.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.672
Don't worry about it,
it's not where i keep the good .

18:27.674 --> 18:28.739
No drinking.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.674
Ohhhh!

18:29.676 --> 18:31.209
No drinking.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.677
Hey, what's your problem?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.779
We need to toast

18:34.781 --> 18:35.847
This momentous occasion
in our relationship, do we not?

18:35.849 --> 18:36.714
No.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.717
We do not.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.387
You know it's funny,
my team has been setting this up

18:43.389 --> 18:45.156
For months working
on every last detail.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.724
The only reason
we even need you

18:46.726 --> 18:49.427
Is because you happen to have
a really fast ship.

18:49.429 --> 18:53.764
And yet you deem it okay
to just start barking orders at.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.701
I gotta tell you,
it's not very attractive.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.904
You think i give a shit whether
or not you find me attractive?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.906
Well i wouldn't think
you'd wanna admit it

19:01.908 --> 19:04.609
In front of your boys here,
but there it is.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.179
Okay, okay, let's
just all take a breath.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.680
We're all friends.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.617
Ahh.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.852
Let me rephrase that.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.854
We're all forced to work togeth.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.856
So let's make the best of it.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.825
I'll be on the bridge.

19:20.827 --> 19:25.263
Mmm.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.602
Hey, hey, hang on.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.904
Yeah okay, what is it?

19:32.906 --> 19:35.573
I just want to say i'm sorry.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.909
Okay, clearly got off
on the wrong foot in there.

19:37.911 --> 19:41.379
But i think we got a lot more
in common than you realize.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.797
Really?

19:42.798 --> 19:44.214
Yeah well you're clearly
the brains of your operation,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.751
And that's gotta put you
under a lot of pressure.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.652
I understand.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.621
I can help you.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.890
How, exactly?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.959
I've met women like
you all over the galaxy.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.496
Smart, beautiful.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.465
You intimidate men
in order to maintain control.

20:01.467 --> 20:06.904
But what you really need, deep ,

20:06.906 --> 20:11.776
Is a man to step up
and take control of you.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.645
Get your hand off me, now.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.918
Don't tell me you don't like th.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.753
Oh, you're right.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.356
I am gonna enjoy
this quite a bit.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.591
Ooof.

20:26.593 --> 20:31.329
Uhnh.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.897
Ahh!

20:32.899 --> 20:35.499
[heavy breathing]

20:35.501 --> 20:39.971
Aaaaahhh!!!

20:39.973 --> 20:41.706
Ohh.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.942
[groaning]

20:44.944 --> 20:46.444
Ah.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.612
She's into me.

20:47.614 --> 20:52.717
I can tell.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.985
What the hell is that?

20:53.987 --> 20:56.487
It's for the pain.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.924
Alright, then you better
give me two of them.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.994
Ohhh!

21:02.996 --> 21:06.931
Ah.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.866
And again.

21:09.469 --> 21:21.879
¶

21:21.881 --> 21:25.049
Broken wrist, two fractured rib,

21:25.051 --> 21:32.523
And a badly bruised left testic.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.742
He had it coming.

21:34.743 --> 21:36.960
Maybe so, but he's the only one
who knows how to use the battery

21:36.963 --> 21:39.764
To tap into the door
system and get it opened.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.966
We're done before we even start.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.802
This mission is over.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.907
Well, isn't this interesting.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.443
You were the one who
didn't want me around them,

21:52.445 --> 21:56.614
And yet you were the
one who got into a fight,

21:56.616 --> 22:02.353
And now all of sudden
you need me on the team.

22:02.355 --> 22:07.992
I admit there's
irony on many levels.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.928
Are you gonna do it or not?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.630
Of course.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.633
I'm just messing with you.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.752
Okay, here it comes...

22:17.753 --> 22:19.036
And where do you
think you're going?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.037
She's coming with us.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.906
Like hell she is.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.774
I know it's not ideal,
but we have no choice.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.710
And who's fault is that?

22:25.711 --> 22:27.645
Hey, i didn't even want
to take this job, remember?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.947
You and your little
boys club talked me into it.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.082
She's just a kid.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.049
Excuse me?

22:32.051 --> 22:33.985
She can't handle this.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.920
If she's going to ride with us
we can't protect her forever

22:35.922 --> 22:36.921
And you know it.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.788
Hello?

22:37.790 --> 22:40.624
I'm standing right here.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.928
It's my choice.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.364
End of discussion.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.933
You better hope
nothing happens to her.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.610
Look, i told you guys,
i'm good to go okay.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.613
Uh, ahh.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.983
Yeah, i can see that.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.018
Are you sure
she can handle this?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.120
I'm sure.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.755
How old are you, kid?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.857
I have no idea.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.458
I was an orphan.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.795
They lost the records.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.097
I went over your specs,
and i have to say

23:20.099 --> 23:23.801
I was impressed by the way you
were going to use the door's own

23:23.803 --> 23:26.170
Overload protection to get in
without tripping the main line.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.105
That was genius.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.174
Genius...

23:30.176 --> 23:31.942
It wasn't genius.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.012
Ahh...Maybe a little.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.482
Hey, this kid seems
pretty smart to me.

23:38.484 --> 23:41.085
Yeah, there is
one problem though.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.555
We don't have an i.D. For her.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.957
So how do we get her in?

23:48.928 --> 23:49.760
[sigh]

24:03.976 --> 24:06.560
Back again, huh?

24:06.561 --> 24:09.145
Yeah you know how
much i love this place.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.182
Whoa.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.883
What's in the big box?

24:12.885 --> 24:14.218
Plumbing supplies.

24:14.220 --> 24:19.557
¶

24:19.559 --> 24:22.626
We're finally gonna fix
that toilet on level 6.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.035
'bout time.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.736
I hate sharing with g section.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.505
Those guys are pigs.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.140
Tell me about it.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.041
Hey.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.742
Yeah thanks.

24:38.911 --> 24:49.019
¶

24:49.021 --> 24:59.129
¶

24:59.131 --> 25:04.869
¶

25:04.871 --> 25:07.171
Alright if anyone sees us

25:07.173 --> 25:09.640
On the other side of
the door we are screwed.

25:09.642 --> 25:19.683
¶

25:19.685 --> 25:25.055
¶

25:25.057 --> 25:26.824
Nice.

25:27.827 --> 25:33.631
¶

25:33.633 --> 25:35.099
What are you doing in here?

25:35.101 --> 25:37.601
Are you the one who
reported the gas leak?

25:37.603 --> 25:38.302
Gas leak?

25:38.304 --> 25:39.770
What are you talking about?

25:39.772 --> 25:42.673
I don't know, but it
sounded pretty serious.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.850
Enough.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.251
Enough!

25:54.253 --> 26:07.798
¶

26:07.800 --> 26:09.867
The coast is clear.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.304
You okay?

26:13.306 --> 26:14.972
Yeah.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.807
Wasn't the most comfortable rid.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.641
And yet you have
no problem with tight spaces

26:18.644 --> 26:22.980
When you're crawling
through the vents.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.615
Let's go.

26:24.617 --> 26:30.254
¶

26:30.256 --> 26:34.058
Okay, it's almost time.

26:34.060 --> 26:40.230
¶

26:40.232 --> 26:46.103
You guys have any idea
what we're really stealing?

26:48.708 --> 26:52.076
Okay, that's very reassuring.

26:52.078 --> 26:58.749
¶

26:58.751 --> 27:00.117
That's it.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.920
The chamber that houses
the device is inside that lab.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.922
You better be ready.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.323
I'm ready.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.662
I'm ready!

27:13.866 --> 27:15.799
Alright let's go.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.996
There it is, just like wexler s.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.036
Let's do this.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.814
Except he forgot to mention one.

28:03.816 --> 28:07.151
What?

28:07.153 --> 28:08.285
What the hell?

28:08.287 --> 28:09.386
Another robot.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.055
It's an android.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.256
Whatever.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.891
He asleep, or what?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.225
[five] he's recharging.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.393
[snapping]

28:16.395 --> 28:18.095
Don't, please, don't.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.614
He's in power save mode.

28:20.615 --> 28:23.132
As long as he stays that way
his main systems are down.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.185
So we're good then.

28:25.186 --> 28:27.236
When they trigger the alarm,
the power gets cut, remember?

28:27.239 --> 28:30.074
His recharge cycle
will be interrupted.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.010
What do you think happens then?

28:33.012 --> 28:34.778
Punch it.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.749
[beep]

28:38.751 --> 28:39.917
[powering down]

28:39.919 --> 28:46.457
[alarms sounding]

28:46.459 --> 28:48.192
Hey.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.360
How's it going?

28:58.170 --> 29:00.370
There's been a security breach.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.372
None of you are authorized to b.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.174
Yeah, it's a funny
story about that.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.176
All of you line up facing the w,

29:06.178 --> 29:07.478
With your hands
behind your heads.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.381
Just take it easy there pal.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.786
I hate robots!

29:15.788 --> 29:16.286
Android!

29:16.288 --> 29:18.922
Whatever!

29:18.924 --> 29:19.990
Ahh.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.759
Woah!

29:24.964 --> 29:29.800
Look, there's a perfectly
good explanation for this--

29:29.802 --> 29:32.336
Catch me!

29:32.338 --> 29:33.170
Ahhh!!

29:33.172 --> 29:35.939
[sirens]

29:35.941 --> 29:38.208
Can you kill that noise?

29:38.210 --> 29:40.310
'course but that
won't affect the beacon.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.279
There's no way
to turn that off

29:42.281 --> 29:44.047
As long as we maintain
the lockdown.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.116
I wonder how the others are doi?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.453
Ahhhh!

29:49.455 --> 29:50.354
Ugh.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.289
Ahh.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.936
Cain.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.127
[electric shock]

30:37.002 --> 30:39.870
You still think she's not up to?

30:39.872 --> 30:42.573
Nice work, kid.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.275
Yeah don't thank me yet,
we've got a new problem.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.894
No.

30:46.895 --> 30:48.512
I had to dump the whole
charge to drop him like that.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.380
The battery's completely draine.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.417
We've got no way
to open it now.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.484
We're screwed, that's it.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.186
No choice we got to abort.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.188
We've got to pull the plug that.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.857
No no no.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.525
We didn't come all this way
just to give up now.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.993
We can't open the door!

31:02.995 --> 31:04.494
The kid will think of something.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.230
Right?

31:06.232 --> 31:07.464
Your responsibility's the door.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.399
We're just the muscle right?

31:09.401 --> 31:10.901
Yeah right.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.402
And you really came through
on that score, didn't you?

31:12.404 --> 31:13.470
Is there any possible way?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.938
Because if not, cain's right.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.206
We gotta pull the plug.

31:16.208 --> 31:19.409
No, just gimme a minute.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.044
I shorted his control systems,

31:21.046 --> 31:22.412
But the main power's still inta.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.415
The only question is,
does he have enough juice?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.117
We interrupted
his recharge cycle...

31:27.119 --> 31:29.953
Wait, are you saying
we use the android's power

31:29.955 --> 31:32.422
To charge the door?

31:32.424 --> 31:33.991
Yes.

31:33.993 --> 31:34.992
You can do that?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.627
Maybe.

31:36.629 --> 31:37.895
See?

31:37.897 --> 31:39.463
Told ya.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.199
[chuckle]

31:47.473 --> 31:50.140
We're in sensor range of the st.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.609
Lockdown appears to be in effec.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.578
Emergency power only.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.113
Any there any other ships nearb?

31:56.115 --> 31:57.447
Not yet.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.449
They'll be here soon enough.

31:59.451 --> 32:03.086
We'll go prep the shuttle.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.424
Look i don't mean
to add any stress on you

32:07.426 --> 32:10.394
But this whole thing was timed
down to the last second.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.462
We've got about five minutes
until the others end the lockdon

32:12.464 --> 32:14.932
And that security
system comes back online.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.500
I'm going as fast as i can.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.969
But if i don't adjust
the inverter to minimize

32:18.971 --> 32:20.504
Harmonic distortion
we'll get pulsating torque

32:20.506 --> 32:22.039
And the whole thing will fry.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.041
Do you understand
a single word she says?

32:24.043 --> 32:26.143
I stopped listening
a long time ago.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.178
Okay, okay, i think i've got it.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.847
Are you sure?

32:29.848 --> 32:31.515
Cause that pulsating
thing sounded kinda bad.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.483
I'm as sure as i'll ever be.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.553
Alright.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.322
Do it.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.586
Nice work.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.594
[beeping]

33:17.596 --> 33:18.946
That's it.

33:18.947 --> 33:20.297
Time's up.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.648
How do we know they've
secured the device?

33:21.649 --> 33:22.999
If they haven't by now
it's too late anyway.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.568
As soon as lockdown ends,

33:24.570 --> 33:27.104
Protocol says all station
personnel stay put, except secu.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.106
Now they'll initiate
a room to room sweep,

33:29.108 --> 33:32.242
So chances are we're gonna
run into them on the way out.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.311
Be ready.

33:45.424 --> 33:46.289
That's it.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.358
Time to go.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.201
Reverse thrusters, ten percent.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.438
We're docked.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.473
Wait here.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.610
B-squad, what's your status?

34:06.612 --> 34:07.711
G section is clear.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.580
We're heading down to level twe.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.149
Understood.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.421
How many?

34:17.423 --> 34:19.289
There's eight of them
including the leader.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.091
They're all carrying
some kind of club.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.125
Shock sticks.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.127
We use 'em to break up bar figh.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.629
It's not pretty.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.065
There's no other
way to the airlock.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.667
We're cut off.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.707
We're gonna
have to rush them.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.443
Yeah, they have weapons; we don.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.746
We also don't have a choice
if we want to get out of here.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.214
D-squad, are you reading me?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.849
Yessir, go ahead.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.483
We've got the main airlock,
i want you on auxiliary.

34:47.486 --> 34:50.487
No one gets off this station
until i give the all clear.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.556
[four]
are you sure about that?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.222
We've got it!

35:25.224 --> 35:26.490
We got the device!

35:26.492 --> 35:27.657
You missed all the fun.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.127
Believe me, we had
enough fun on our own.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.696
Let's get the hell out of here.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.668
Get it strapped down,
fire it up tiny.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.204
Time to go.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.874
Raza, this is the marauder,
we're on our way.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.417
Did you get it?

35:54.419 --> 35:59.322
We got it.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.458
Android, get us out of here.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.499
Do me a favor, secure this thin.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.403
Hey, hey, it stays with me.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.806
We've got a safe place.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.809
Our ship, our rules, go.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.712
Now we can drink.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.889
You did alright down there.

37:05.891 --> 37:06.756
You did.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.892
Cheers.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.961
Alright there you go, top it up.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.496
Alright, alright.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.932
And alright for the kid.

37:15.934 --> 37:16.900
Whoa no!

37:16.902 --> 37:17.734
Hey!

37:17.736 --> 37:18.719
What are you her daddy?

37:18.720 --> 37:19.703
Yeah what are you thinking.

37:19.705 --> 37:20.870
Really?

37:20.872 --> 37:22.572
Are you kidding me
she did great out there.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.407
You kicked a robots ass.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.810
Nice work kid.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.865
Hope you don't mind.

37:31.866 --> 37:33.816
I wanted to have
at least one look at the bridge

37:33.819 --> 37:37.921
Of the famous raza before
we go our separate ways.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.490
It's really impressive the way
you've maintained this ship.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.859
Look at this place,
it can't be easy.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.594
Why, thank you.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.328
I do take a great
deal of pride in--

37:46.331 --> 37:53.703
[electric shock]

37:53.705 --> 37:55.772
[electric shock]

38:04.483 --> 38:05.815
Cheers.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.318
Bottoms up.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.290
[three]
hey look who it is!

38:13.292 --> 38:14.557
Catch.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.661
Drinks right there,
drinks go to you.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.963
You know, when you
guys first came on board,

38:19.965 --> 38:21.298
I didn't like you much.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.799
Awe, and now?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.335
I still don't like you.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.804
Then you're about to like us ev.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.807
What the hell?

38:30.809 --> 38:31.908
That's my gun.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.744
Not anymore.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.013
Okay, kid.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.948
Make yourself useful.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.535
Android, why did we drop out of?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.078
[electric shock]

40:11.143 --> 40:12.976
Wexler, what is this?

40:12.978 --> 40:15.645
Smile for the camera.

40:15.647 --> 40:19.048
Your friends are all watching.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.659
Now i know you got the device
in a vault somewhere on board,

40:29.661 --> 40:32.929
So why don't you give me
the code and this'll all be ove.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.632
I thought you could crack
any safe in the galaxy.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.634
I can, i just don't have
a lot of time right now,

40:37.636 --> 40:39.636
So we're gonna do
this the easy way.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.639
If you think i'm gonna give you
anything, you can forget it.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.941
Oh no, no, no, no, no,
not you, your friends.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.943
See, they can either
give me the code,

40:46.945 --> 40:49.646
Or they can watch you
get blown out into space.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.081
So what's it gonna be, folks?

40:52.083 --> 40:53.783
Don't give him anything.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.920
Hey, hey, hey,
do you think i'm bluffing?

40:56.922 --> 40:59.155
I mean hell,
you're just the first.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.158
After that we do the kid.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.463
Nothing?

41:06.465 --> 41:08.465
Okay i'll tell you what i'm gon,

41:08.467 --> 41:09.833
We're gonna kick it old school.

41:09.835 --> 41:13.169
I'm gonna count down from five,
and if no body speaks

41:13.171 --> 41:16.139
By the time i get to zero,
out she goes.

41:16.141 --> 41:22.712
Five, four, three, two--

41:22.714 --> 41:24.965
M--

41:24.966 --> 41:27.217
Maplethorpe!

41:27.219 --> 41:29.953
The code is
maplethorpe.

41:29.955 --> 41:34.691
With an "e".

41:38.230 --> 41:39.896
Check it out.

41:39.898 --> 41:46.202
¶

41:46.204 --> 41:47.737
We did the job.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.072
Why are you doing this?

41:49.074 --> 41:50.874
Are you kidding me?

41:50.876 --> 41:52.809
The collective
bounty on this crew

41:52.811 --> 41:55.044
Is worth as much
as the device alone.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.514
Plus this way we
get to keep the ship.

41:57.516 --> 42:00.083
It's what i like to
call a win-win-win.

42:17.836 --> 42:18.768
Yeah it's cain.

42:18.770 --> 42:19.869
I'm in.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.638
We got it.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.880
You know it's really too bad,

42:30.882 --> 42:32.782
We could've had
some real fun together.
