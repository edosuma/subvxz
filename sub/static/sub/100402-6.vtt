WEBVTT

01:52.695 --> 01:55.698
Halt, sisters, and welcome.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.867
Welcome is for guests.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.996
You summoned us here against our will,
Zelda Spellman.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.250
I did, Gryla. I summoned you here
for the good of all witchkind.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.418
You are no longer safe on your own.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.755
None of us are.
A community of pagans has risen.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.259
They have a gorgon and the great god Pan
in their menagerie.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.427
Their plan is to kill us all.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.013
I smell weakness.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.433
I smell fear.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.479
No one summons Pesta...

02:28.273 --> 02:29.482
and lives!

02:29.566 --> 02:30.608
<i>Arrêtez!</i>

02:30.942 --> 02:32.110
Stop!

02:32.402 --> 02:34.487
We do not need to fight each other.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.865
That is what men do.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.993
But we are women, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

02:40.702 --> 02:42.078
Witch women.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.457
We can do more than fight, can we not?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.750
Yes.

02:48.835 --> 02:49.711
Quite.

02:53.298 --> 02:57.635
We face a common enemy,
and our choice is simple:

02:58.094 --> 02:59.262
unite, or die.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.515
You know me, Gryla.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.350
You know what I stand for.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.479
Now please, will you listen
to what I have to say?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.154
Do you have any gin?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.073
Certainly.

03:19.157 --> 03:24.370
Sabrina, fetch food and drink
for our guests. And chairs.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.498
Get Prudence and Nicholas to help you.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
And find your Aunt Hilda, will you?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.085
She should be here.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.553
If you had to choose, like,
absolutely had to choose...

03:40.637 --> 03:43.431
-Yep.
-...would it be <i>Munsters</i> or <i>Addams Family?</i>

03:43.514 --> 03:44.557
Oh, gosh--

03:44.641 --> 03:46.226
-Be careful with this choice.
<i>-</i>I will be.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.644
-Could be a deal-breaker.
-I know.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.563
So, this is the controversial decision.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.522
Oh, no.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.317
But <i>The Munsters.</i>

03:55.485 --> 03:58.613
-Oh, wrong answer, apparently.
<i>-</i>Wow.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.240
Telly's not on my side.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.158
What's--

04:05.078 --> 04:06.120
Hilda!

04:08.623 --> 04:09.832
What is it, love?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.003
I--

04:19.092 --> 04:20.760
You know,
I never thought I would say this,

04:20.843 --> 04:24.097
but I may have been watching
too many horror movies.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.848
- Oh.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.642
Okay, well, in that case,

04:27.725 --> 04:31.354
why don't we rehearse our number
for the <i>Sweeney Todd</i> audition next week?

04:31.437 --> 04:32.272
Oh!

04:32.355 --> 04:33.189
Hey, Mr. T?

04:33.273 --> 04:36.192
Oh, marvelous idea, Mrs. Lovett.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.194
I'm full of them, you know.<i> </i>Come on.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.952
Your coven has always
turned our kind away.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.622
For centuries,
we've had to brave the wilderness alone.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.749
Why should we join you now?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.210
Our numbers are depleted.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.379
Our magick's non-existent.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.716
We need your strength, it's true.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.803
But if you help us,
this could be your home.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.180
We could make a new coven together.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.517
There is wisdom in what she says.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.770
Better to be united for what is coming.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.689
What about the Dark Lord?

05:16.190 --> 05:20.028
At large, but trapped in a flesh Acheron,
as far as we know.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.738
His strength muted.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.742
If we agree to help,
what would you need us to do?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.910
Stand with us against the pagans
when they come.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.455
They said three days,
but they could come at any moment.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.333
Pesta, you could poison the soil
around the Academy

05:33.416 --> 05:36.669
so if any pagan touched it,
they'd shrivel with disease.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.173
I could do that, yes, easily.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.716
Where would we sleep?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.509
I've brought my house.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.345
The Desecrated Church.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.639
Sabrina, would you prepare it
for our guests.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.976
Prudence and, um... Nicholas can help you.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.980
Sure.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.992
What news from the Pit?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.995
Any sign of our fugitive Dark Lord?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.872
We've searched the Nine Circles, mistress,

06:12.955 --> 06:15.500
and His Dark Lordship is
nowhere to be found.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.251
But this gift came for you.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.639
What is it, Your Magnificence?

06:30.515 --> 06:33.393
A fetish doll given to me by Adam.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.812
I must admit, I...

06:38.731 --> 06:39.941
I really love it.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.484
Back in the Garden?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.903
Not that Adam.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.324
Mary Wardwell's Adam.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.701
I was actually quite fond of him.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.915
Then Lucifer slaughtered him as proof
that he would never show me mercy.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.086
This gift is from the Dark Lord,

07:01.587 --> 07:03.256
a not so thinly veiled threat

07:03.339 --> 07:06.134
that he's on his way
to seek revenge for my...

07:07.468 --> 07:09.971
usurping him and imprisoning him.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.807
Pack my belongings.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.687
I must leave Hell at once
and seek safe haven elsewhere

07:17.937 --> 07:20.440
before he manages
to separate from Blackwood.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.330
Hey, how you doin', Sabrina?

07:36.414 --> 07:39.250
Fine, Nick, and you?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.878
Um... good, yeah.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.006
Just didn't think
we'd be seeing each other so soon.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.509
Well, we do go to the same school
and belong to the same coven, so...

07:48.593 --> 07:51.012
All right, what's going on
between you two turtledoves?

07:51.095 --> 07:52.889
Why aren't you kissing and holding hands?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.727
-We're taking a break.
-We broke up.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.564
So now you're just--

08:01.647 --> 08:02.565
Friends.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.276
Right.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.278
Friends.

08:08.779 --> 08:13.284
Well, I'm gonna get some more pillows
and blankets for the hedge witches.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.578
Yeah, you do that, Nicky.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.210
Sabrina, your mortal side is showing.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.170
Heartbreak's not a good look on witches.

08:24.253 --> 08:28.049
Nick dumped me less than two hours ago,
Prudence, I think I'm allowed.

08:28.132 --> 08:32.345
Oh, I can make the pain go away
with a cord-cutting spell.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.722
It's a very simple spell.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.141
All you need is two candles
joined by one wick,

08:37.225 --> 08:40.603
and whatever emotional ties
you have with Nicholas

08:40.686 --> 08:41.896
will be burned away for good.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.024
What if this is just temporary,
and we still get back together?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.484
Is that what you want?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.195
Why?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.989
I mean, come on, Sabrina, be honest.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.075
Were you and Nick ever good together?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.703
I mean, don't get me wrong.
We were all living for the drama,

08:57.787 --> 09:00.331
but you two were mismatched
from the start.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.502
Let me ask you this,
did Nicholas ever thank you?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.087
For what?

09:06.587 --> 09:08.005
For saving his life,

09:08.089 --> 09:09.715
for helping him get clean?

09:10.424 --> 09:12.426
-No.
-No.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.763
And yet, all you want is
to go back for more.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.390
Hmm.

09:17.473 --> 09:20.476
I would think that you, of all people,
would have more self-respect than that.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.354
Forgive me if I don't take romantic advice
from you, Prudence.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.856
Where are you going?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.191
After Nicholas?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.361
No, to save my friends,

09:30.444 --> 09:32.363
and take a break from this place.

09:34.907 --> 09:39.203
Ladies, infernal sisters,
if I might bother you for a moment.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.540
I've been asked to collect
all of your information.

09:42.623 --> 09:47.795
First up is Gryla of the Mountains.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.798
Single mother of...
How many yule lads do you have?

09:50.881 --> 09:54.343
Thirteen lads in my brood,
and another coming.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.845
Congratulations.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.763
And where are they currently?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.766
They're all around you, warlock.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.147
Right. Uh...

10:07.732 --> 10:10.401
Moving onto Sycorax.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.154
Now, confirming you are a sea witch?

10:13.237 --> 10:14.989
No, a river witch.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.532
Forgive me. Um.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.825
And what can you do?

10:18.534 --> 10:20.536
-I could drown you where you stand.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.164
But of course.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.542
As Zelda said, you will be very helpful
against the pagans.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.711
All of you will.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.884
Where have you guys been? You look--

10:34.967 --> 10:37.053
We were in the mud. Where have you been?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.180
All over. Things have been a little crazy.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.432
-Baseball players got turned into pigs.
-What?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.392
Harvey and Billy and Carl went
to the carnival.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.894
And this woman, some kind of witch--

10:44.977 --> 10:46.062
Circe.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.357
...turned Billy and Carl
and Martin and Eric into pigs.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.983
They're in Theo's barn.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.735
And Robin's one of 'em.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.280
Wait, Robin, you're a pagan?

10:57.865 --> 10:59.200
I travel with them.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.202
If you travel with the pagans,

11:01.285 --> 11:03.621
then why are you here with Theo and Harvey
and not with them?

11:04.622 --> 11:09.752
They are planning a slaughter
that I will not be party to.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.131
I knew love once,
and I wanna feel it again.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.967
I... I am feeling it again,

11:17.718 --> 11:19.679
and I don't want what they want,
not anymore.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.805
And what do they want?

11:22.181 --> 11:28.604
They... We came to Greendale
to resurrect the pagan gods,

11:28.688 --> 11:31.023
starting with the oldest one,
the Green Man.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.525
Why should we believe you?

11:32.942 --> 11:36.195
Robin didn't have to tell us any of this.
He's trying to help.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.780
I, uh...

11:40.241 --> 11:42.076
I put myself in your hands.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.580
And there's no going back to the pagans
after what I said to you.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.792
How do we stop them?

11:50.835 --> 11:51.669
Um...

11:53.629 --> 11:54.714
What?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.090
Guys, what is it?

11:56.590 --> 12:01.345
The ultimate resurrection of the Green Man
can't happen without a virgin sacrifice.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.640
Which is why Robin got close to me

12:04.724 --> 12:07.059
and why the snake charmer
got close to Harvey,

12:07.143 --> 12:09.228
to keep tabs on us,

12:09.311 --> 12:12.440
'cause we're, um... we're all, um...

12:13.607 --> 12:14.442
Virgins.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.943
Except for Roz,

12:16.152 --> 12:18.988
which is part of the reason
why they turned her into stone.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.282
Also, 'cause she could use her cunning
against them.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.950
This is a nightmare.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.995
And when exactly is this resurrection
supposed to happen?

12:26.078 --> 12:30.666
When the Green Man's head scrapes the sky,
and the ripe fruit falls from his arms.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.795
So there's still time to stop that
from happening and save Roz?

12:34.879 --> 12:37.465
You keep saying that, Sabrina, but how?
You don't have any powers.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.883
Perhaps I can help.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.343
What the hell is he doing here?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.262
Caliban, if this is
about the third challenge--

12:43.345 --> 12:47.391
I came to make a proposal,
away from the courts of Hell.

12:47.475 --> 12:51.812
If my queen were to entertain it,
I would, in turn, help your friend.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.148
What do you know
about turning someone from stone to flesh?

12:54.982 --> 12:55.900
I'm made of clay.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.985
True, forgot about that.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.363
There's a spell, a Pygmalion spell
that will turn her back into flesh.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.366
- Do you know it?
-Not by heart, no, I'd have to find it.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.162
If you came with me,
I could outline my proposal.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.623
-Sabrina, if he can fix Roz--
-Fine, I'll do it.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.291
Let's go.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.422
Whoa.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.382
I should go.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.426
We should go.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.805
Um... but we'll swing by later,
okay, Harvey?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.519
Harvey.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.645
Dad.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.772
Come into the house. Dinner's ready.

13:35.981 --> 13:36.982
I'm not hungry.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.903
Harvey, get your ass in the house.
I'm not eating alone.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.696
Take a shower.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.532
You look like hell.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.757
<i>♪ By the sea, Mr. Todd</i>
<i>That's the life I covet ♪</i>

14:01.841 --> 14:04.885
<i>♪ By the sea, Mr. Todd</i>
<i>Oh, I know you'd love it ♪</i>

14:04.969 --> 14:08.848
<i>♪ You and me, Mr. T</i>
<i>We could be alone in a house ♪</i>

14:08.931 --> 14:12.017
<i>♪ What we'd almost own down by the sea ♪</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:17.022
<i>-♪ Anything you say ♪</i>

14:46.260 --> 14:47.261
What?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.183
Hilda?

14:53.642 --> 14:54.935
Okay. Dr. Cee?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.437
No, no, no, stay away from me!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.731
Stay... stay away from me.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.358
Okay. Okay.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.319
It's okay, love.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.279
It's just me.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.240
It's just me.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.911
Could we just sit down?

15:12.953 --> 15:15.706
Just come, and I'll explain.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.335
Please.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.758
Why's it called a Pygmalion spell?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.802
Don't you know the myth of Pygmalion?

15:29.970 --> 15:33.599
He was a sculptor
who carved a woman made of ivory.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.478
Pygmalion fell in love with the statue,

15:38.479 --> 15:39.855
wished her alive.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.067
He made an offering to the gods,

15:43.776 --> 15:46.987
promised he would give up
his greatest love, sculpting.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.784
In exchange,
when Pygmalion kissed the statue,

15:53.869 --> 15:55.120
she turned to flesh.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.042
That's beautiful.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.880
-Why are you crying?
-You wouldn't understand.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.925
And we have a spell to find.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.637
Yes, and a proposal to discuss,
which you promised to consider.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.682
We could compete against each other

16:14.765 --> 16:17.059
to find the third item
of the Unholy Regalia,

16:17.142 --> 16:18.602
Judas' pieces of silver,

16:19.228 --> 16:20.062
or...

16:21.522 --> 16:23.065
we could work together to find them.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.819
-Who would win the throne in that case?
-We both would.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.614
We could align and rule Hell together.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.574
Align?

16:33.742 --> 16:34.576
Get married.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.578
Married?

16:37.037 --> 16:39.373
I think we want different things, Caliban.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.250
-Are you certain of that?
-A hundred percent.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.128
I don't wanna turn Earth into
the Tenth Circle of Hell, for starters.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.131
-What if I took that off the table?
-Is this a negotiation?

16:47.756 --> 16:50.884
Because if so,
I'm still not marrying you, Caliban.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.096
-A, I just broke up with my boyfriend--
-Make me a counter offer then.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.640
And I'll give you this spell I just found.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.435
Is that it, the Pygmalion spell?

17:01.311 --> 17:05.649
What will you trade me for it to save
your friend and stabilize the realms?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.443
Are we seriously having this conversation?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.361
A monarch must know how to compromise.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.907
Well, as you suggested,
Earth would be off-limits,

17:13.991 --> 17:16.577
and there would be
no enslavement of anyone.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.370
But what would we do instead?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.540
We'd reform the Hell that already exists,
make it better,

17:22.124 --> 17:24.376
work with Heaven
instead of against it, maybe.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.754
Work with Heaven?
Do you think they would do that?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.840
Caliban, why do you even wanna be King?

17:30.966 --> 17:34.011
Same as you want to be Queen... power.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.766
I need certain things from you
in writing first.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.687
And to be clear, our alignment
would be political and not romantic.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.273
-Carnal?
-Not carnal, no.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.108
But if you just broke up
with your boyfriend--

17:48.192 --> 17:49.651
Maybe we'll get back together.

17:52.654 --> 17:56.408
Perhaps we should continue this discussion
after we cure your friend.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.996
You heart might have softened
towards me by then.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.425
Lilith, what in the heaven
are you doing here? What's wrong?

18:13.967 --> 18:15.302
You know very well.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.263
Lucifer walks free.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.808
Don't you think
he'll take vengeance upon us?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.811
The Dark Lord is not known
to forgive and forget.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.230
I've already received a threat.
I need asylum.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.274
I am sorry for that, but we're rather
more focused on not being annihilated

18:29.358 --> 18:31.026
by a group of unhinged pagans.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.905
-I could help you.
-Oh, you, the ultimate wild card.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.991
But you must give me sanctuary.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.120
You worship me.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.501
And what good has that done us?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.004
No, find someplace else to hide.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.382
You...

18:55.676 --> 18:57.219
You're a pathetic lot,

18:58.220 --> 19:01.765
hanging your onions
to keep the Dark Lord at bay.

19:03.058 --> 19:03.892
No.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.646
No, I think I won't stay here.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.817
What good are witches against his wrath?

19:14.361 --> 19:19.241
No, what I need is a good Christian woman.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.582
Oh, no. Oh, Harvey!

19:26.665 --> 19:27.833
Roz broke.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.585
I don't know what happened.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.589
I left for 15 minutes and came back,
and she was... like this.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.384
Caliban, does this mean she's--

19:37.467 --> 19:40.470
Dead? No. She needs to be
put back together, that's all.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
She's in all these pieces.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.141
We'll gather and arrange them
into her shape.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.310
Make sure none of her bits are missing.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.354
There's a special epoxy we'll need.
I'll prepare it and be right back.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.452
I hate this.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.246
I'm so sick of putting all you guys
in danger.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.583
This one isn't on you, 'Brina.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.669
You're not making the pagans
go after virgins.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.379
True.

20:16.423 --> 20:20.093
So you and Roz never...

20:22.679 --> 20:23.513
No.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.559
We were going to, for sure.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.854
But?

20:33.440 --> 20:34.441
But...

20:36.902 --> 20:38.403
the carnival came to town.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.365
That's when everything
started going wrong.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.286
Nick and I never had sex either.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.997
Really?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.794
I assumed 'cause you're a cool witch,
and he's a cool warlock that--

20:53.877 --> 20:55.087
Nope.

20:55.170 --> 21:00.300
He definitely has, like, all the time,
but not with me.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.930
We broke up...

21:06.306 --> 21:07.474
earlier today.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.185
What? How come?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.729
Lots of reasons.

21:12.813 --> 21:13.772
I dunno.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.901
Maybe he just wasn't the right one.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
It's a spell, a pagan spell.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.379
Well, a curse, and there's nothing
that can be done. I've tried everything.

21:37.462 --> 21:41.967
I've tried every potion, every poultice,
every arcane incantation.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.844
It's just that the curse is too strong.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.762
What does that mean?

21:46.430 --> 21:49.474
That I'm going to die, I think.

21:50.392 --> 21:54.104
No, Hilda, that's--
I won't allow that to happen.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.190
-I--
-Darling, it's better to accept it.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.692
Accept, never.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.111
Hilda Spellman, now you listen to me.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.740
We're gonna have a long, long life,
you and me.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.660
A simple life in the country with a fire
and books and tea and everything.

22:08.744 --> 22:13.582
Everything that you ever wanted,
because that's what you deserve.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.708
Oh...

22:15.417 --> 22:19.087
I want nothing more
than to have a quiet life with you.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.215
-I'm calling Zelda.
-Stop it. Stop it, please.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.678
There's nothing that can be done.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.765
And I don't wanna burden Zelda.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.600
I don't wanna burden the coven,
not like this.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.187
I came here because I wanted
to spend time with you before it...

22:39.149 --> 22:40.233
Can we do that?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.613
Of course.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.741
Yes, if that's...

22:49.368 --> 22:51.203
if that's what you really wanted.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.038
Um...

22:53.872 --> 22:58.168
just tell me if there's anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.420
You are a treasure.

23:04.674 --> 23:08.595
Now, I do have a craving, besides flies.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.017
There's a diner in Riverdale,
and it sells the juiciest hamburgers

23:14.101 --> 23:17.854
and the thickest milkshakes,
not that yours are not wonderful.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.566
Of course, of course. Coming right up.

23:31.284 --> 23:35.080
Bondye, almighty Gran Mèt,

23:35.163 --> 23:38.458
we behold the <i>pouvoir</i>
of the Universal Creator

23:38.542 --> 23:40.919
as we ask for your protection.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.964
Hear our <i>priyère</i> to Ginen,

23:44.047 --> 23:49.761
as we surrender to the spirits
of the ancestors and divine within.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.033
That is quite enough.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.369
What exactly is the meaning of this?

24:15.954 --> 24:20.041
<i>Tanpri, </i>you have nothing
to be afraid of, eh.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.587
I am only sharing the ways
of Haitian voodoo with the sisters.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.130
That is not why you are here.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.841
I asked Mambo Marie
to teach us a dance of protection.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.597
In that case, Prudence,
may I have a word with you alone?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.640
Yes, Sister Spellman.

24:41.438 --> 24:45.400
You, a prefect,
drumming while this perfect stranger--

24:45.484 --> 24:47.611
Mambo Marie is not a stranger.

24:47.694 --> 24:51.072
Ambrose and I met her in New Orleans.
She helped me find my father.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.366
I don't understand,
why did she answer our call then?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.744
I invited Mambo Marie.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.662
Separate from the summoning.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.248
She happened to arrive
at the same time as the hedge witches,

25:00.332 --> 25:01.833
but she is certainly not one of them.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.629
We are in the fight of our lives
against the pagans and their monsters.

25:05.712 --> 25:09.049
Yes, and if we're going to survive it,
we need to adapt.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.343
I've seen her magick work.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.969
She doesn't get power
from the Dark Lord,

25:13.053 --> 25:16.389
she gets it from... somewhere else,
and if we could learn where--

25:16.473 --> 25:19.142
Never in the history
of the Church of Night

25:19.226 --> 25:22.312
has an outsider been allowed
to lead a ceremony.

25:22.395 --> 25:27.859
Oh, I see, so you invite the hedge witches
because they can't challenge your status.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.278
But I invite one occultist
with the skill and authority

25:30.362 --> 25:32.155
to help us out of this mess,
and you're worried

25:32.239 --> 25:33.865
she threatens your position
in the church.

25:33.949 --> 25:38.328
Prudence, she is a Catholic,
for Satan's sake.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.045
I am sorry you are frightened
by my ceremony.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.091
I can see you are wary of the unknown.

25:52.551 --> 25:58.807
<i>Mais calmez-vous, </i>the only spirits
I invite in are the ones I know and trust.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.687
As for myself,
perhaps if you knew me better,

26:04.312 --> 26:07.607
I would not be quite so fearsome.

26:08.733 --> 26:13.613
I am Mambo Marie LeFleur,
Vodouisant of the Fourth Ward.

26:22.247 --> 26:26.918
I can see your <i>mèt-tèt.</i> He is beautiful.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.296
Powerful.

26:30.171 --> 26:34.217
I can see you and I are more alike
than you know.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.973
It is true, Prudence invited me,

26:41.558 --> 26:46.146
but I have been waiting for her invitation
all my life.

26:48.023 --> 26:48.940
You see,

26:49.899 --> 26:56.072
my <i>mèt-tèt </i>told me, long ago,
that something was coming.

26:56.781 --> 27:01.036
Something very old and very evil,

27:01.119 --> 27:04.998
and that if I could summon my courage,

27:05.624 --> 27:10.211
I might play a role
in helping to beat it back.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.173
But of course,

27:15.342 --> 27:17.844
I will not stay where I am not wanted.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.349
Wait! Mambo Marie,

27:24.100 --> 27:28.563
I admit that I'm a bit wary of newcomers,

27:29.564 --> 27:32.317
but I can see you mean to help,

27:32.734 --> 27:35.195
and I'm in no position to refuse you.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.155
So please, stay,

27:38.323 --> 27:40.033
as our honored guest.

27:40.533 --> 27:45.455
High Priestess Zelda Spellman,
I accept your invitation.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.089
Is that every piece of her?

27:54.839 --> 27:56.800
Yeah, we checked everywhere.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.512
What do we do now, glue her back together?

28:00.595 --> 28:04.349
The Pygmalion spell will be most effective
where you and your beloved first kissed.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.017
Do you remember where that was?

28:06.101 --> 28:09.521
Yeah, of course, at school,
the night of the Valentine's dance.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.022
-Is it close?
-Mm-hmm.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.401
Let's take her there then. Carefully.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.779
We'll apply the epoxy,
and then you'll make your offering.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.200
Maybe we should take two trips.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.745
We can help you carry her.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.749
Please let us.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.837
Let me help.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.929
Hello.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.305
Anybody here?

28:45.306 --> 28:47.392
Um, go away. We're closed.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.441
Sign says you're open, lady.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.818
And I was hoping to get some dinner.
I'm hungry.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.447
I am too.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.241
Come to the back then.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.034
Uh...

29:05.994 --> 29:06.953
Okay.

29:16.838 --> 29:20.383
Hey, you know what, I've changed my--

29:27.515 --> 29:29.184
When she comes back to life,

29:30.018 --> 29:31.895
she won't be scarred, will she?

29:31.978 --> 29:34.063
-She will not.
-Oh, that's a relief.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.190
What happens now?

29:35.273 --> 29:38.067
You say the spell, but first,
you make your offering.

29:38.651 --> 29:41.529
-To whom?
-Aphrodite or Eros.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.989
What am I offering?

29:43.072 --> 29:44.491
Your love for Rosalind.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.785
Give it up,
and she'll be restored to flesh.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.787
Give it up? What are you talking about?

29:48.870 --> 29:51.331
Aphrodite is the goddess of love.

29:51.414 --> 29:54.667
She'll grant your wish,
but demands your heart's desire, Rosalind.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.922
Vow to forsake your truest love,

29:59.422 --> 30:02.091
then to complete the spell...

30:02.842 --> 30:03.676
kiss her.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.054
She'll restore to flesh once more.

30:06.137 --> 30:09.140
But if you betray your vow,

30:10.058 --> 30:11.768
if you ever kiss her again,

30:12.644 --> 30:15.772
she'll return to stone and will remain
that way until the end of days.

30:15.855 --> 30:19.734
Wait, no! Harvey, there has to be
some other kind of offering.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.152
There is none.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.737
That is the price.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.406
Love for life.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.329
I'll do it.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.207
I'll do it.

30:38.127 --> 30:41.965
Say the words to Aphrodite
and give her a kiss.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.015
Roz...

30:53.101 --> 30:54.394
if you can hear me...

30:56.980 --> 30:58.022
I love you.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.317
Please understand that I had to do it.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.492
"Aphrodite, fair and mighty,

31:09.576 --> 31:12.704
take this form of fixed stone,

31:12.787 --> 31:14.706
and turn her back to flesh and bone.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.126
As below, so above...

31:21.212 --> 31:24.591
I yield to you my truest love."

31:37.812 --> 31:38.938
Nothing happened!

31:39.522 --> 31:40.356
Caliban?

31:41.232 --> 31:42.567
His offering was rejected.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.361
-What does that mean? Why?
-You must not truly love her.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.696
That's bullshit!

31:46.779 --> 31:48.823
Aphrodite would only accept
your heart's true desire.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.368
That must not be Rosalind.
Must be something else or someone else.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.120
-Shut the hell up!
- Hey!

31:55.496 --> 31:57.832
What'd you know,
you and your bullshit spell?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.460
-How do we know if any of this is real?
-Why would I lie?

32:00.543 --> 32:02.128
Harvey, Caliban, stop!

32:02.211 --> 32:04.964
Strike me again, mortal. I'll grind
every bone in your body to sand.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.342
-All right, that's enough.
-Tell them what you told me.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.303
-I should kick your ass.
-Harvey!

32:10.386 --> 32:11.804
Please calm down.

32:15.558 --> 32:17.268
Tell us what, Robin?

32:17.810 --> 32:20.188
Among the pagans,
there's that witch, Circe,

32:20.271 --> 32:22.023
the one that turned your friends
into pigs.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.400
She has powerful magicks
of transformation.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.569
She could turn your friend
back into flesh.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.279
For someone who's trying
to earn our trust,

32:28.363 --> 32:29.906
why would you only tell us this now?

32:29.989 --> 32:32.075
No, it's too dangerous.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.370
Circe's power resides in her hands.
All she'd have to do is touch you,

32:35.453 --> 32:38.164
and she could turn you
into any creature she's ever seen before.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.167
And without magick,
you're no match against her.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.088
I don't have magick, it's true,

32:46.297 --> 32:48.132
but I know where we can borrow some.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.559
-Yes.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.020
Who is it?

33:05.441 --> 33:06.442
Who's there?

33:07.902 --> 33:10.697
Mary, it... it's me.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.907
Adam?

33:23.751 --> 33:25.211
-Adam.
-Mary.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.592
I feared the worst. I...

33:33.219 --> 33:37.432
-I thought you were dead.
-No, no, no, no, my darling, I'm here.

33:38.182 --> 33:41.519
But, Mary, someone's after me,
someone bad,

33:41.602 --> 33:44.689
someone dangerous,
and I need you to hide me.

33:46.315 --> 33:50.236
Where have you... where have you been?
I mean, who's after you?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.030
There's no time to explain.

33:52.113 --> 33:56.367
You must hide me with your goodness.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.245
Only your goodness can protect me
from what's coming.

33:59.746 --> 34:03.291
Please, please, I...
I'm at your mercy.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.418
If you love me, help me.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.216
I love you.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.802
Of course...

34:16.054 --> 34:17.055
I'll help you.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.689
Just stoke the fire
and give us the light--

34:26.773 --> 34:29.442
Prudence, have you seen Ambrose?
We need his help with something.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.777
I believe he---

34:30.860 --> 34:33.571
Oh, wow, that didn't take long.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.910
I guess I was right.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.369
Right about what, Nick?

34:40.453 --> 34:43.081
About you and your friend here.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.334
-I knew it the night of the carnival.
-Caliban is helping me save Roz.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.128
It's okay, Spellman,
you don't have to lie to me.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.463
Lie to you?

34:52.048 --> 34:57.053
I have never once lied to you
about anything, Nick.

34:58.638 --> 35:02.183
Unlike you, who lied to me constantly,
when you weren't cheating on me.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.393
She does have a point, Nicky.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.686
And I am sorry.

35:05.770 --> 35:09.023
I am truly sorry
you went through what you did.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.902
Everyone on this planet owes you a debt
they can never repay,

35:14.070 --> 35:17.990
but you're not a martyr,
and you're not an innocent.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.785
And don't ever disrespect me again,

35:20.868 --> 35:22.954
or you can forget about us
ever being friends.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.539
-Sabrina.
-Save it.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.916
Believe it or not,
I have more important things to deal with

35:26.999 --> 35:29.001
than your drama and narcissism right now.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.446
Hilda?

36:08.457 --> 36:10.084
No, no, Hilda.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.381
Good news...

36:17.049 --> 36:18.217
Dr. Cee.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.095
I'm not dying.

36:22.763 --> 36:27.393
It turns out I just needed
a little bit of blood,

36:28.603 --> 36:33.608
and that has made me so much lustier.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.611
What?

36:38.029 --> 36:41.073
I have all these eggs inside me

36:41.866 --> 36:46.162
waiting to be fertilized.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.625
You're not scared of me, are you?

36:57.340 --> 36:59.759
You're still in love with him,
or is it just lust?

36:59.842 --> 37:01.385
Quit while you're ahead, Caliban.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.346
Ambrose, are you here?

37:04.889 --> 37:06.557
Or is it the mortal that you love?

37:06.641 --> 37:08.309
-Excuse me?
-As he loves you.

37:08.392 --> 37:09.852
-He does not.
-Mmm.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.395
Okay, you know what?

37:11.896 --> 37:14.523
I so do not need to be having
this conversation with you right now.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.817
Is this what it's like for you
when you're not in Hell?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.945
It's called multi-tasking, Caliban.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.905
And I suppose
you're the picture of nobility?

37:22.114 --> 37:23.741
You rang, cousin?

37:23.824 --> 37:24.784
I did.

37:24.867 --> 37:27.745
I need your help with something.
Caliban, I'll see you later.

37:28.955 --> 37:29.872
Bye!

37:30.289 --> 37:31.290
As you wish.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.795
Hmph...

37:36.837 --> 37:38.631
back in the saddle already, I see.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.260
I'm ignoring that, by the way.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.765
And I've been thinking about those witches
we summoned, Ambrose,

37:47.848 --> 37:51.102
and your stone circle,
and how it's time we go on the offensive.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.687
Oh, why is that?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.605
We need Roz and Dorcas back asap

37:54.689 --> 37:56.983
before their transformation to stone
is irreversible.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.236
Right now, the pagans don't know
about the hedge witches.

38:00.319 --> 38:02.196
That gives us an advantage.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.746
Oh, how can I help you, Father?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.040
Good woman Wardwell,
my name is Father Brown.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.877
I'm visiting the homes
of good Christian folks to warn them.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.922
Is yours a good Christian home?

38:20.006 --> 38:22.842
I should hope it is, Father.

38:23.759 --> 38:24.677
Warn them?

38:25.553 --> 38:26.804
Evil is afoot.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.599
The Devil has come to Greendale.

38:31.183 --> 38:32.560
-The Devil?
-Mm-hmm.

38:33.728 --> 38:38.649
Why, yes, I have felt his presence,
too, all around me, and there's...

38:39.734 --> 38:44.280
there's so many... so many things
I have no explanation for.

38:44.697 --> 38:49.118
But there is a darkness here,
of that I'm sure.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.913
Quite right, Goody Wardwell,
but Satan does not work alone,

38:52.997 --> 38:54.040
he has allies.

38:54.957 --> 38:55.875
Allies?

38:57.710 --> 39:00.588
Do you mean witches?

39:00.671 --> 39:03.049
Yes, witches.
There are witches in Greendale.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.260
Some you may even know.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.387
Who? Who?

39:10.014 --> 39:13.142
Sabrina Spellman and her family.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.603
They are witches.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.857
They seek to destroy you,
to make you unholy.

39:20.608 --> 39:24.320
Tell me, Mary, are you weak?

39:24.403 --> 39:26.322
Will you let Satan take hold of you?

39:26.405 --> 39:27.698
No, never!

39:27.782 --> 39:29.492
Do you not feel him, woman?

39:29.575 --> 39:32.745
Do you not know when the Devil himself
is in your own home,

39:32.828 --> 39:35.539
manipulating you,
appearing to you in some guise?

39:35.623 --> 39:38.584
-What guise?
-He could appear to you as anyone, Mary.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.128
A friend, a student,

39:42.129 --> 39:45.007
an errant lover perhaps.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.428
Adam.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.265
I could've sworn he was dead, but...

40:01.315 --> 40:02.441
He's here,

40:03.818 --> 40:04.819
the Devil.

40:07.613 --> 40:08.614
Over there.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.117
Please.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.369
Please help me.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.998
Do I have your permission,
good woman Wardwell?

40:19.583 --> 40:20.584
Take it.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.006
Prepare yourself, Devil.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.760
Prepare to meet your match!

40:41.230 --> 40:42.731
Reveal thyself, deceiver.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.236
No.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.697
I'd run if I were you.

40:49.780 --> 40:50.739
Oh!

40:55.870 --> 40:57.580
Very good, Lilith.

40:57.663 --> 41:02.084
We'll want privacy for what comes next,
a ritual of separation.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.085
Come on!

41:08.382 --> 41:10.009
Diretrix Spellman speaking.

41:10.092 --> 41:12.803
<i>Zelda, help me, please.</i>

41:12.887 --> 41:13.846
Hilda?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.598
Sister, where are you?

41:15.681 --> 41:16.724
<i>He's dead.</i>

41:17.516 --> 41:19.643
<i>He's dead, and I killed him.</i>

41:19.727 --> 41:21.604
Who?<i> </i>What are you talking about?

41:22.313 --> 41:23.939
<i>Come to Dr. Cee's,</i>

41:24.940 --> 41:26.859
<i>and please, bring a gun.</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:28.819
-Hildy--

41:34.283 --> 41:37.495
Hey, witches, who wants some vino?

41:38.037 --> 41:39.705
-Give it here.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.880
<i>♪ An old man came riding by</i>
<i>We say so ♪</i>

41:47.963 --> 41:49.465
<i>♪ And we know so ♪</i>

41:49.548 --> 41:55.179
<i>♪ And the sharks will have his body</i>
<i>And the Devil have his soul ♪</i>

41:57.973 --> 41:58.974
Sisters!

41:59.433 --> 42:02.645
My Aunt Zelda would have us wait
for the pagans,

42:02.728 --> 42:05.689
but I say, we are strong!

42:06.815 --> 42:09.860
I say we take our fight to them.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.613
Who wants to mess up some pagans?

42:19.828 --> 42:22.206
Remember, witches,
we're focusing our energies on Sabrina.

42:22.289 --> 42:25.751
The stones around us will reflect
those energies back onto her poppet.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.086
Prudence will cue us.

42:29.129 --> 42:34.176
<i>Sororibus,</i>
<i>audire vocationem nostram.</i>

42:34.718 --> 42:38.973
<i>Sororibus, audire vocationem nostram.</i>

42:39.056 --> 42:42.851
<i>Sororibus,</i>
<i>audire vocationem nostram.</i>

42:45.312 --> 42:46.355
All right, Salem.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.941
Let's find Circe
and get the heaven outta here.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.126
Hey!

43:08.502 --> 43:10.296
We give to thee the power--

43:10.379 --> 43:11.505
Pesta!

43:23.225 --> 43:24.893
We give to thee the power of--

43:24.977 --> 43:26.020
Sycorax!

43:32.318 --> 43:34.528
We give to thee the yule lads of--

43:34.612 --> 43:35.446
Gryla!

44:02.431 --> 44:05.684
And where did you come from?

44:08.270 --> 44:10.230
I've got her.<i> </i>Do it now!

44:16.570 --> 44:17.821
Release me, heathens.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.116
Not until you undo the damage you
and your pagans did to our friends.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.495
First, you're turning Roz and Dorcas here
back to flesh.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.664
Even if I could, I would never!

44:26.747 --> 44:29.208
You're a witch of transformation, Circe,
that's what you do.

44:29.291 --> 44:32.711
Well, if you don't,
I suppose we only really need your hands.

44:33.253 --> 44:36.340
Ambrose is right, Circe.
We can do this the easy way...

44:36.423 --> 44:39.885
Or we can do this
the <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> way.

44:39.968 --> 44:42.596
We'll take those hands from you ourselves
to save our friends.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.015
Try to attack us,
and we'll chop you down like a tree.

44:53.315 --> 44:54.400
I...

44:57.611 --> 44:58.737
submit.

45:10.749 --> 45:16.880
These bodies petrified in stone,
return them please to flesh and bone.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.052
Oh, my sister.

45:22.720 --> 45:23.637
Roz!

45:24.054 --> 45:25.055
Oh, are you okay?

45:27.683 --> 45:30.185
- Sister. Oh, my sister.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.277
And now, traitor?

45:40.279 --> 45:43.699
Now, you're gonna turn those pigs

45:44.450 --> 45:45.701
back into jocks.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.995
Wait, turn what into who?

45:50.205 --> 45:52.332
All of them, back to who they were.

45:53.041 --> 45:56.754
They'll kill you for betraying them,
Carcosa and Nagaina.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.380
Just do it, Circe.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.931
Welcome back, boys.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.683
Now here's how it's going to be.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.269
You're going to follow me out
of the Academy,

46:12.352 --> 46:14.730
and then you're going to walk
to your respective homes,

46:14.813 --> 46:18.108
and you're not going to remember anything
from the last two days.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.777
Is that understood?

46:22.279 --> 46:23.238
Good.

46:23.697 --> 46:24.740
Come with me.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.122
Hilda?

47:14.039 --> 47:16.083
What in Satan's name?

47:18.001 --> 47:19.545
It's Dr. Cee.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.507
Hilda, is that you?

47:30.931 --> 47:33.892
Hildy, what happened?

47:34.852 --> 47:36.395
Pagans did this.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.940
What? Turned you into a spider woman?

47:44.528 --> 47:46.697
That's why you have to shoot me.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.159
Hilda, what rubbish.
Of course I can't do that.

47:53.328 --> 47:54.329
Please.

47:57.374 --> 47:58.417
It's the only way.

48:02.254 --> 48:03.630
Do you know,

48:04.673 --> 48:06.592
I believe you're right, sister.

48:22.691 --> 48:25.319
So, Circe's in the dungeon
and the boys are back home,

48:25.402 --> 48:26.278
none the wiser.

48:26.361 --> 48:29.448
A win for us.
Not a huge win, but a win nonetheless.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.951
Glad to have you in the Fright Club, dude.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.579
I'm, uh, glad to be here.

49:40.268 --> 49:41.353

A <i>mèt-tèt </i>is a guardian spirit
that watches over us

50:03.500 --> 50:05.544
from the moment we are born.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.255
We each have a <i>mèt-tèt.</i>

50:08.922 --> 50:10.382
Even me and Judas?

50:10.465 --> 50:12.175
Yes, <i>chérie,</i>

50:12.718 --> 50:16.471
because everyone is worthy
of a <i>mèt-tèt's</i> guidance...

50:17.305 --> 50:18.724
and protection.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.518
A stroke of genius bringing Marie
to the Academy.

50:22.394 --> 50:25.522
I invited her, Ambrose,
but she came for her own reasons.

50:26.565 --> 50:29.568
Until they're revealed,
I want her to teach us her ways,

50:31.069 --> 50:32.654
even Judith and Judas.

50:34.072 --> 50:36.533
Perhaps she can undo
my siblings' brainwashing.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.953
I hope you're right, Prudence.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.719
The oil is ambergris.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.639
The water...

51:00.474 --> 51:02.100
is from the River Styx.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.102
Water and oil.

51:05.228 --> 51:07.939
The separation ritual is quite simple.

51:08.982 --> 51:11.443
Like splitting a yolk from an egg.

51:12.819 --> 51:17.032
But it's recommended
that both parties be asleep, Dark Lord.

51:49.523 --> 51:50.982
Father Blackwood.

51:52.692 --> 51:53.610
Demoness.

51:55.904 --> 51:56.863
Where am I?

51:57.572 --> 51:58.615
What is this?

51:59.533 --> 52:01.827
You're in a tub of water mixed with oil.

52:03.453 --> 52:07.457
Now that Lucifer is asleep,
we have business to discuss, and quickly.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.793
What business
could I possibly have with you?

52:10.293 --> 52:16.716
We must perform an act
that will ensure we both remain alive

52:17.342 --> 52:19.469
after I separate you from the Dark Lord.

52:20.428 --> 52:24.141
Otherwise, it will be a horrific death
for the two of us.

52:26.351 --> 52:27.519
What kind of act?

52:28.728 --> 52:29.646
Oh...

52:31.314 --> 52:32.649
one you are...

52:34.151 --> 52:36.027
intimately familiar with.

52:55.797 --> 52:57.591
<i>Poor Dr. Cerberus.</i>

52:57.674 --> 52:59.843
I wish I'd known about Aunt Hilda.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.305
I could've brought her to Circe
without you having to...

53:04.097 --> 53:05.265
kill her.

53:05.390 --> 53:09.144
Yes, well, perhaps we should
start talking again, Sabrina...

53:09.644 --> 53:11.313
being a family again.

53:12.355 --> 53:13.607
I've missed you.

53:15.775 --> 53:18.069
And if my hunch is correct,
and they usually are,

53:18.153 --> 53:21.031
when Hilda rises from the Cain Pit,
she'll be her old self again,

53:21.114 --> 53:24.284
not that spider monstrosity
I shot in the bookstore.

53:24.701 --> 53:27.746
How long do you reckon before she awakens?

53:28.163 --> 53:29.915
Shan't be too much longer now.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.628
In fact, I'm going to go wait
in the parlor.

53:35.253 --> 53:39.382
And tonight, we shall dine as a family.

53:40.550 --> 53:41.843
Well done, both of you.

53:44.679 --> 53:47.265
And as soon as your Aunt Hilda
comes back to us,

53:47.349 --> 53:50.560
we'll return to the Academy
and prepare for the upcoming battle.

54:01.988 --> 54:05.033
No, Salem, I have to do this
for my own good.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.287
Prudence said to carve my name
on this one, Nick's on the other,

54:09.371 --> 54:14.459
then I just burn the wick,
and all my feelings for him are gone.

54:14.542 --> 54:16.044
Our cords cut.

54:20.507 --> 54:23.009
Yes, of course, Nick, who else?

54:24.761 --> 54:25.845
Harvey?

54:25.929 --> 54:32.435
No. I mean, I'll always love Harvey,
but I don't think I still...

54:40.068 --> 54:41.444
I don't wanna hurt Roz.

54:42.404 --> 54:43.738
I don't wanna hurt Harvey.

54:45.407 --> 54:46.866
It's better safe than sorry.

55:40.045 --> 55:43.256
-Oh, at last.

55:50.305 --> 55:51.348
Hilda.

55:51.806 --> 55:53.975
Witches, all of them.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.269
Witches.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.228
Lilith?

56:03.735 --> 56:04.986
This is for Adam.
