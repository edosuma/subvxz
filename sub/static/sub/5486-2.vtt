WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:03.610
Danny, listen to my great idea.

00:03.610 --> 00:04.844
We should name the baby

00:04.845 --> 00:06.312
after a classic movie character,

00:06.313 --> 00:08.848
like Indiana or Wall-E.

00:08.849 --> 00:10.417
I told you,
I want a name from history.

00:10.418 --> 00:12.852
Yeah, I suggested O.J.
and you thought it was too edgy.

00:12.853 --> 00:14.154
Although to be safe,

00:14.155 --> 00:15.955
we probably should pick
something gender-neutral.

00:15.956 --> 00:17.524
You know, in case he's trans.

00:17.525 --> 00:19.125
He's not gonna be trans.

00:19.126 --> 00:20.760
Well, that's up to herm.

00:20.761 --> 00:21.928
"Herm"?

00:21.929 --> 00:22.929
I don't think so.

00:22.930 --> 00:24.164
- Danny?
- Hmm?

00:24.165 --> 00:25.665
Put your book down. I'm horny.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.067
Uh, okay, babe, maybe...

00:28.068 --> 00:30.203
- Maybe not tonight.
- Come here, come here.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.604
Okay, okay.

00:32.606 --> 00:35.141
Just want a little sweet D.

00:35.142 --> 00:37.110
It's just,
I don't want my special guy

00:37.111 --> 00:38.912
so close to my special guy.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.380
I mean, he might hear us.

00:40.381 --> 00:43.116
You don't want to have
sex because of the baby?

00:43.117 --> 00:46.119
Danny, this is my baby.
He loves sex sounds.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.321
How would you like it if you
were minding your own business

00:48.322 --> 00:51.224
and a big penis just came
and hit you right in the face?

00:51.225 --> 00:53.426
Yeah, that's my life
you're describing.

00:53.427 --> 00:55.094
Sweetheart, look at this ring.

00:55.095 --> 00:57.330
This is our solemn oath
to be with each other

00:57.331 --> 00:59.032
for the rest of our lives,
is it not?

00:59.033 --> 01:00.433
- It is, yes.
- Okay.

01:00.434 --> 01:02.569
You bought the cow,
now get the milk for free.

01:02.570 --> 01:04.671
Babe, I'm sorry, I just...

01:04.672 --> 01:06.372
A son should only see
his father's thing

01:06.373 --> 01:08.041
when they stop on a hike to pee.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.209
You know what, you prude?

01:09.210 --> 01:10.944
I don't even need you.
Read your book.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.414
I will just draw my own erotica.

01:18.352 --> 01:20.086
Aah. Ooh.

01:20.087 --> 01:21.688
This is some real good stuff.

01:21.689 --> 01:23.923
You're just drawing
the number 69.

01:23.924 --> 01:25.592
Yeah. Ooh la la.

01:25.593 --> 01:26.893
- Oh oh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.894 --> 01:29.729
You keep it going, 69.

01:29.730 --> 01:32.966
- Just please, please! Please!
- What? Stop! No!

Oh, good news, everybody.

01:51.452 --> 01:54.120
I'm taking the entire staff
out to dinner tomorrow night,

01:54.121 --> 01:56.322
with Whitney,
the girl I'm dating.

01:56.323 --> 01:57.924
It's actually
the restaurant where the guy

01:57.925 --> 02:00.493
breaks up with his phone plan
in the Verizon commercial.

02:00.494 --> 02:01.794
No big deal.

02:01.795 --> 02:03.930
Sorry, I'm taking
a night school class.

02:03.931 --> 02:06.232
It's called
"Making Excuses at Work."

02:06.233 --> 02:09.435
Bev! I was counting on you.
Come on, guys.

02:09.436 --> 02:12.639
Don't make Whitney think
I'm a weird loser with no friends.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.307
- Adrian?
- No, sorry.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.644
I gotta give the dog his shots
while my wife's on a date.

02:17.645 --> 02:19.279
At least she's letting
me in the house.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.047
Mindy, Morgan.

02:21.048 --> 02:23.483
You love free slop.

02:23.484 --> 02:27.620
Look, Jeremy. I for one would
love to want to go to that.

02:27.621 --> 02:29.489
But my fertility
clinic has a booth

02:29.490 --> 02:31.157
at the Manhattan Fertility Expo.

02:31.158 --> 02:33.826
Yeah, we started a pretty
innovative new program.

02:33.827 --> 02:35.194
It's to convince
girls in their 20s

02:35.195 --> 02:36.429
to want to freeze their eggs.

02:36.430 --> 02:38.531
It's called "Later, Baby!"

02:38.532 --> 02:41.067
And it was my idea!
I'm a business partner.

02:41.068 --> 02:42.902
Frisbee!

02:42.903 --> 02:43.970
- Sorry.
- Really?

02:43.971 --> 02:45.805
No takers for a free dinner?

02:45.806 --> 02:47.407
Unbelievable.
You lot would turn down

02:47.408 --> 02:49.075
a free car if it was from me!

02:49.076 --> 02:51.945
Wait, who's giving
away a free car?

02:51.946 --> 02:53.513
Uh, I'm good.

02:53.514 --> 02:55.381
I... I mean... just...

02:55.382 --> 02:56.883
Tamra!

02:56.884 --> 02:59.319
Hey, we were wondering
if we could run our spiel

02:59.320 --> 03:00.920
for the Fertility Expo by you?

03:00.921 --> 03:03.890
'Cause you're young
and millennial, right?

03:04.925 --> 03:06.259
Perfect.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.161
Do you know there's no better
time to freeze your eggs

03:08.162 --> 03:09.429
than when you're in your 20s?

03:09.430 --> 03:11.230
Mm-hmm, and it's
a great way to make sure

03:11.231 --> 03:14.133
that your reproductive
health is... on fleek.

03:14.134 --> 03:17.604
And that is... cool.

03:17.605 --> 03:19.138
Freezing your eggs?

03:19.139 --> 03:20.740
I heard that stuff's unnatural,

03:20.741 --> 03:22.375
at least that's what
the midwives from upstairs said

03:22.376 --> 03:23.476
in their ad.

03:23.477 --> 03:25.545
- The midwives?
- Yeah, look.

03:25.546 --> 03:27.447
Okay.

03:27.448 --> 03:30.083
Pollution. Drought.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.918
Peanut sensitivity.

03:31.919 --> 03:35.521
The modern world is
ruining our lives.

03:35.522 --> 03:38.091
And now, from birthing
drugs to egg freezing,

03:38.092 --> 03:41.194
Big Fertility wants to change
the way we make new life.

03:41.195 --> 03:42.895
But there is another way...

03:42.896 --> 03:44.564
A more natural way.

03:44.565 --> 03:46.566
At Downtown Women's
Holistic Health Center,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.167
- my brother Duncan and I...
- Hi!

03:48.168 --> 03:51.137
Are returning to traditions
when birth was a tribal ritual,

03:51.138 --> 03:55.241
spiritual, erotic even...
not a sterile medical procedure.

03:55.242 --> 03:58.077
Brendan has the charisma
of a young Paul Newman.

03:58.078 --> 03:59.379
That's enough.

03:59.380 --> 04:02.982
Drug-free birthing techniques
for every kind of family,

04:02.983 --> 04:06.386
from same-sex couples to
inter-species triples.

04:06.387 --> 04:08.354
Let's hear from Brooke Burke.

04:08.355 --> 04:09.789
Thanks to Paleo Birth,

04:09.790 --> 04:13.326
I didn't go into labor
surrounded by masked doctors.

04:13.327 --> 04:14.661
Masks?

04:14.662 --> 04:15.928
Really, doctors?

04:15.929 --> 04:17.130
What are you hiding?

04:17.130 --> 04:19.699
You know who else wears masks?
Bank robbers.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.034
And ISIS.

04:21.035 --> 04:24.137
I gave birth right here
in my Brentwood garden,

04:24.138 --> 04:27.040
and my child's first sight
wasn't a hospital gown.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.441
It was a butterfly.

04:28.442 --> 04:32.078
And then the sprinklers
came on and we had to move.

04:32.079 --> 04:33.546
Paleo Birth.

04:33.547 --> 04:36.716
Stone Age health
care is finally here.

04:36.717 --> 04:37.850
Bye-bye!

04:37.851 --> 04:39.018
Natural birth?

04:39.019 --> 04:40.586
Easy for you to say,
Brooke Burke!

04:40.587 --> 04:42.488
If I had a birthing
canal that straight,

04:42.489 --> 04:44.557
basically, having a baby
is like taking a big fart.

04:44.558 --> 04:45.625
All right, yeah, sure,

04:45.626 --> 04:47.493
that movie was
beautiful and well-made,

04:47.494 --> 04:48.795
but at the end of the day,

04:48.796 --> 04:50.196
what are you gonna
remember more:

04:50.197 --> 04:53.332
A great movie,
or a good ol' Frisbee

04:53.333 --> 04:55.501
made in the U.S. of...

04:55.502 --> 04:56.903
- Chernobyl?
- Okay, just...

04:56.904 --> 05:00.206
Y'all mad.
That video was hella compelling.

05:00.207 --> 05:02.075
And everyone knows Brooke
Burke doesn't get out of bed

05:02.076 --> 05:03.876
for less than $10,000.

05:03.877 --> 05:06.112
Okay, it wasn't compelling
and everyone hated it.

05:06.113 --> 05:07.246
And let me tell you something.

05:07.247 --> 05:09.615
I will never have
a natural birth, okay?

05:09.616 --> 05:11.217
I'm gonna be so drugged
out for my C-section,

05:11.218 --> 05:12.418
that when I wake up,

05:12.419 --> 05:14.320
Donald Trump will have
started second term.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.759
Morning, Danny.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.728
C-section? Drugged up?

05:21.729 --> 05:24.731
Have we not gone over
my birthing plan?

05:24.732 --> 05:26.966
What the hell?
You want to have the baby here?

05:26.967 --> 05:29.635
Sir, this is the most luxurious

05:29.636 --> 05:31.170
birthing suite in Manhattan.

05:31.171 --> 05:33.306
We've hosted everyone
from Bethenny Frankel

05:33.307 --> 05:34.707
to Miss Tina Fey.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.110
It's everything
I've ever creamed of.

05:37.111 --> 05:39.278
Come on, this place is
bigger than my apartment.

05:39.279 --> 05:40.346
It's nicer, too.

05:40.347 --> 05:41.781
Danny, look at this place!

05:41.782 --> 05:44.517
There's a massage chair,
there's satellite radio.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.986
They put spa water
in the IV for you.

05:46.987 --> 05:49.522
Sir, I understand you're
nervous, but don't worry.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.224
This suite has a "Dad Cave,"

05:51.225 --> 05:53.793
with a tequila list
curated by Pitbull.

05:53.794 --> 05:54.827
A very smart breed.

05:54.828 --> 05:56.129
I don't care about any of that.

05:56.130 --> 05:57.263
Mindy,
don't you think you should

05:57.264 --> 05:58.698
check out the delivery room?

05:58.699 --> 06:00.333
Oh, don't worry about that,
Dr. Lahiri.

06:00.334 --> 06:01.834
You'll never remember it.

06:01.835 --> 06:04.337
You've opted for the five-day
C-section knockout package.

06:04.338 --> 06:05.671
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

06:05.672 --> 06:07.607
Are you serious?
You want to be high on goofy gas

06:07.608 --> 06:09.609
for the most beautiful
moment of your life?

06:09.610 --> 06:11.611
Okay, the most beautiful
moment of my life

06:11.612 --> 06:13.746
was when I got a selfie with
Gayle King on that flight.

06:13.747 --> 06:15.515
Second of all, Danny,
this is my delivery.

06:15.516 --> 06:17.583
Just let me do what I want.

06:17.584 --> 06:19.786
Well, you have time to decide.

06:19.787 --> 06:22.321
Her baby removal appointment
isn't until next Saturday.

06:22.322 --> 06:24.023
You mean childbirth?
Okay, guys, look.

06:24.024 --> 06:25.725
We need to figure
this out, okay?

06:25.726 --> 06:27.426
We need to be prepared
if the little guy

06:27.427 --> 06:29.562
wants to come out on its own...
naturally.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.230
- Naturally?
- Naturally.

06:31.231 --> 06:32.732
He can't come out early!

06:32.733 --> 06:35.368
Then he'd be a Virgo and Virgos
are honest and reliable.

06:35.369 --> 06:37.436
Okay. All right.

06:37.437 --> 06:38.571
Uh, Brad?

06:38.572 --> 06:41.574
This was an amazing tour.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.709
This is for you.
For your troubles.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.311
Sir, this is a dollar.

06:45.312 --> 06:47.915
Exactly,
and I need 50 cents back.

06:49.550 --> 06:51.017
Hello, Daniel. I'm excited

06:51.018 --> 06:53.519
you've finally decided to
see me about your problem.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.721
Problem? What problem?

06:55.722 --> 06:57.190
Well...

06:57.191 --> 06:59.225
You were molested by
your priest as a child.

06:59.226 --> 07:01.194
That's why your personality
turned out this way.

07:01.195 --> 07:03.329
Why does everyone
assume I was molested?

07:03.330 --> 07:05.264
Listen, the reason I'm here
is because I saw your video

07:05.265 --> 07:08.501
and I thought you might
be able to suggest some...

07:08.502 --> 07:11.270
non-medical ways to
induce childbirth.

07:11.271 --> 07:13.639
Mm-hmm, I understand.
And remind me again

07:13.640 --> 07:15.675
how you described
my methods on the local news?

07:15.676 --> 07:18.744
Was it "superstitious
hoodoo for dumdums?"

07:18.745 --> 07:21.047
Yeah, I stand by it.
But who knows?

07:21.048 --> 07:23.583
The Yankees always won every
time I sat on Father Tony's lap.

07:23.584 --> 07:26.452
I mean, anything's possible.

07:26.453 --> 07:29.355
Hmm. I think I can help you.

07:29.356 --> 07:31.624
Chapter seven of
my new book "Paleo Birth"

07:31.625 --> 07:35.361
suggests natural ways
to induce childbirth.

07:35.362 --> 07:37.163
That's great. Thank you.

07:37.164 --> 07:38.164
You're welcome.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.232
How much do I owe you?

07:39.233 --> 07:40.833
You know what?
Just pay it forward.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.602
Initiate a conversation on race.

07:42.603 --> 07:44.203
Take in a homeless
person for a week.

07:44.204 --> 07:46.839
Start a critical mass
bike ride for veganism.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.742
Okay, great. Thank you.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.614
Whoa.

07:54.615 --> 07:55.982
Lot of candles, babe.

07:55.983 --> 07:58.718
Natural ways to
induce childbirth...

07:58.719 --> 08:01.087
Come over here.
Try this arrabbiata.

08:01.088 --> 08:02.755
You cooked?

08:02.756 --> 08:04.857
Ooh. Looks great.

08:04.858 --> 08:05.958
- There you go.
- Okay.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.793
Spicy foods...

08:07.794 --> 08:09.395
Ow!

08:09.396 --> 08:12.031
Oh, my God! That is very spicy.

08:12.032 --> 08:13.966
- Sorry, here.
- Hm.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.501
- Red wine...
- Alcohol?

08:15.502 --> 08:16.702
Yeah.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.070
Tried to have a sip of
your beer last month,

08:18.071 --> 08:19.405
you called me Casey Anthony.

08:19.406 --> 08:20.673
Not tonight.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.408
Massage...

08:22.409 --> 08:24.911
Would you like a massage?

08:24.912 --> 08:26.579
Okay.

08:29.116 --> 08:32.051
Oh, that's good.

08:32.052 --> 08:33.119
Ah, babe.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.054
Nipple stimulation...

08:37.124 --> 08:38.323
Ow!

08:38.325 --> 08:39.859
Why'd you tweak my tit?

08:39.860 --> 08:41.360
I'm horny, let's get to it.

08:41.361 --> 08:43.129
- You're horny?
- Very.

08:43.130 --> 08:45.464
Oh, my God, Danny,
this is great news,

08:45.465 --> 08:47.199
'cause I've been cheating
on you with a banister .

08:47.200 --> 08:48.367
- Let's go.
- Mmm.

08:48.368 --> 08:50.636
Sexual intercourse.

08:50.637 --> 08:52.605
Ow, ow. There's something here.

08:52.606 --> 08:53.941
Don't worry about it.

08:55.609 --> 08:57.476
- "Paleo Birth"?
- Nah, it's...

08:57.477 --> 08:59.478
Danny, why do you have this?

08:59.479 --> 09:01.882
Were you trying to boink
the baby out of me?

09:06.954 --> 09:07.954
I cannot believe you.

09:07.955 --> 09:09.488
You tried to trick my body

09:09.489 --> 09:11.557
into giving birth
before my C-section.

09:11.558 --> 09:12.892
Booze? Sex?

09:12.893 --> 09:14.760
Danny, you used all
my favorite things against me!

09:14.761 --> 09:17.263
Look, Min, if you have this
baby safe and naturally,

09:17.264 --> 09:18.364
you'll be glad you did.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.933
Your body knows how to
do this... it knows.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.134
My body is an idiot.

09:22.135 --> 09:24.170
Have you ever seen me
try to climb a ladder?

09:24.171 --> 09:26.973
Danny, it's decided, okay?
I'm getting a C-section.

09:26.974 --> 09:28.441
Do you know what
that C stands for?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.876
Yeah, comfort,
convenience, coolness.

09:30.877 --> 09:33.479
No. C is for "coward."

09:33.480 --> 09:35.548
C-sections are designed

09:35.549 --> 09:36.849
for emergencies,

09:36.850 --> 09:38.985
not for rich women to
schedule their births

09:38.986 --> 09:40.586
between spin classes.

09:40.587 --> 09:42.822
How dare you.
You know I don't spin.

09:42.823 --> 09:45.291
Look, if you let it,

09:45.292 --> 09:47.093
birth can be
a beautiful experience.

09:47.094 --> 09:48.594
Excuse me?

09:48.595 --> 09:50.463
I'm an OB/GYN, too, Danny.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.331
We both know that childbirth
is a horror movie.

09:52.332 --> 09:53.866
Basically, your vagina explodes

09:53.867 --> 09:55.468
a bloody,
screaming little alien.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.769
Yeah, well,
that sounds beautiful to me.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.171
Besides,
the pain of childbirth, I mean,

09:59.172 --> 10:01.173
that's a rite of
passage for a woman.

10:01.174 --> 10:03.576
Why should only women have
to suffer through pain, okay?

10:03.577 --> 10:04.744
Why don't you get one
of your cavities filled

10:04.745 --> 10:05.745
without any Novocain?

10:05.746 --> 10:06.746
I don't get cavities, okay?

10:06.747 --> 10:08.047
I got a brushing ritual.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.448
Two minutes up and down,
two minutes round and round,

10:09.449 --> 10:10.683
- and I go...
- I can't listen to you

10:10.684 --> 10:12.351
talk about how you brush
your teeth anymore.

10:12.352 --> 10:14.220
Why does it bother
you so much, okay?

10:14.221 --> 10:15.588
Why don't you just let
me sleep through it,

10:15.589 --> 10:17.123
like when you make
me watch "Frontline"?

10:17.124 --> 10:18.190
Okay, so you want
to sleep through

10:18.191 --> 10:19.525
your first big challenge
of being a mom?

10:19.526 --> 10:21.027
Fine.

10:21.028 --> 10:24.030
But there's gonna be nothing but
more challenges down the line,

10:24.031 --> 10:27.300
and you're not gonna be
able to sleep through those.

10:35.075 --> 10:37.643
- Startle the mother.
- Dammit, Danny!

10:37.644 --> 10:41.080
Whoo! Expo is here, Dr. L!

10:41.081 --> 10:43.549
I am nervous, but excited.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.518
What two things are you?

10:45.519 --> 10:48.020
My two words?
Betrayed and upset.

10:48.021 --> 10:49.388
What?

10:49.389 --> 10:50.589
You want to know what Danny
tried to do last night?

10:50.590 --> 10:54.093
Danny tried to trick my body
into giving birth early.

10:54.094 --> 10:55.661
- Okay, between me and you?
- Yeah?

10:55.662 --> 10:57.196
- I love Dr. C.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.197 --> 10:59.198
He's always been the Yoko of
our relationship.

10:59.199 --> 11:00.199
Well, who am I?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.134
- The Beatles.
- Who are you?

11:02.135 --> 11:04.070
Morgan. Not a music fan.

11:04.071 --> 11:05.271
Listen, the point is this.

11:05.272 --> 11:08.374
You are a confident,
beautiful ethnic goddess, okay?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.976
Don't let some man tell you
what to do with your body.

11:10.977 --> 11:12.578
- Thank you.
- Last time I checked,

11:12.579 --> 11:14.346
this was America,
and we respect women here.

11:14.347 --> 11:16.282
Yeah, "Roe v. Wade" and stuff.

11:16.283 --> 11:19.151
Yeah, "Roe v. Wade,"
Dwyane Wade, all the Wades.

11:19.152 --> 11:21.087
Thank you, Morgan. You're right.

11:21.088 --> 11:23.289
And you know what?
I'm really excited for the Expo.

11:23.290 --> 11:24.857
As long as this
little guy doesn't try

11:24.858 --> 11:26.325
to come out before
the C-section.

11:26.326 --> 11:28.327
Oh, let me handle that one.

11:28.328 --> 11:31.030
Hey, boy! Hey, sit!

11:31.031 --> 11:32.865
Sit! Stay!

11:32.866 --> 11:33.966
Okay.

11:33.967 --> 11:36.001
Good boy. You get a treat.

11:36.002 --> 11:37.870
Okay, how many times
have I told you?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.205
The only thing you're
allowed to kiss are my feet.

11:39.206 --> 11:40.673
You got it.

11:40.674 --> 11:42.341
Well, it's gonna be great.

11:42.342 --> 11:43.409
Aah!

11:43.410 --> 11:44.543
Ow!

11:44.544 --> 11:45.678
What happened? Did you say "ow"?

11:45.679 --> 11:47.513
Or did you start to say "owl?"

11:47.514 --> 11:49.683
'Cause I can get you an owl.

11:54.721 --> 11:55.921
Hey, mate.

11:55.922 --> 11:58.757
Hey, what do you think
about Frank as a baby name?

11:58.758 --> 12:00.659
Oh, I have
a brother named Frank.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.794
You do?

12:01.795 --> 12:03.529
Yeah, he used to walk
me to the garden,

12:03.530 --> 12:06.866
where he'd have the others
wait for me, with their sticks.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.869
I gotta stop
running these names by you.

12:09.870 --> 12:13.439
Okay, so, what's up?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.441
Oh, nothing.
Just seeing who's around.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.443
I'm surprised you're not
at the Fertility Expo.

12:17.444 --> 12:19.945
Yeah, Mindy and I had
a difference of opinion.

12:19.946 --> 12:21.280
I thought I'd stay here.

12:21.281 --> 12:23.315
Aha! Busted!

12:23.316 --> 12:25.484
If you're not going to the Expo,
then you have no choice

12:25.485 --> 12:27.153
but to come to dinner
with Whitney and me.

12:27.154 --> 12:28.320
Tonight?

12:28.321 --> 12:30.055
To... oh, you know what?

12:30.056 --> 12:32.424
I'm sorry, I just remembered,
Ma needs me...

12:32.425 --> 12:34.293
No, no, no, no, no.
You're trapped, Danny,

12:34.294 --> 12:36.795
like a mouse wriggling
on glue paper.

12:36.796 --> 12:38.864
Now Whitney will see
what good friends I have.

12:38.865 --> 12:40.400
Ha!

12:44.571 --> 12:47.306
Hey, guys... I appreciate
that you're coming with us,

12:47.307 --> 12:49.441
but do you think you could
let a pregnant lady sit?

12:49.442 --> 12:50.676
Sorry, I can't.

12:50.677 --> 12:53.145
My legs are tired from
being long and thin.

12:53.146 --> 12:55.114
How do you know
I'm not pregnant?

12:55.115 --> 12:56.382
I'm late!

12:56.383 --> 12:57.950
So then,
I will just continue to stand,

12:57.951 --> 13:00.186
even though I am
1,000 months pregnant.

13:00.187 --> 13:01.587
You guys are jerks.

13:01.588 --> 13:02.688
Oh, God.

13:02.689 --> 13:03.956
It's the Deslauriers.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.559
Oh, hey, Brendan! Duncan!

13:06.560 --> 13:07.993
Come over here
and stand with us!

13:07.994 --> 13:09.395
What are you doing?
We hate them.

13:09.396 --> 13:10.496
Oh, right.

13:10.497 --> 13:12.031
- Hey, Morgan.
- Hey, what's up?

13:12.032 --> 13:13.332
Oh, hi, guys!

13:13.333 --> 13:15.434
What a nice coincidence, ha-ha.

13:15.435 --> 13:18.270
Mindy, congratulations.
When did you have the baby?

13:18.271 --> 13:19.405
Okay, that's hilarious.

13:19.406 --> 13:21.373
What are you, a comedian now?

13:21.374 --> 13:24.510
For your FYI, this baby is
getting delivered on schedule,

13:24.511 --> 13:25.678
in a ritzy birthing suite,

13:25.679 --> 13:28.714
that Saddam Hussein called,
quote, "a bit much."

13:28.715 --> 13:30.716
Aah.

13:30.717 --> 13:32.618
Are you okay?

13:32.619 --> 13:34.220
Are you having contractions?

13:34.221 --> 13:37.189
No, I was just remembering a
funny joke that Morgan told me.

13:37.190 --> 13:38.791
Oh, was it the one
about the banana

13:38.792 --> 13:40.559
on a date with silverware?

13:40.560 --> 13:42.895
"You're very a-peel-ing.
Wanna fork?"

13:43.930 --> 13:46.599
Why is the floor all wet, Mindy?

13:46.600 --> 13:47.933
Oh, God.

13:47.934 --> 13:49.635
'Cause she's laughing
so hard at my joke,

13:49.636 --> 13:51.303
she peed herself, obviously.

13:51.304 --> 13:53.372
Yeah, why is it
so hard to believe

13:53.373 --> 13:55.040
that Morgan is hilarious?

13:55.041 --> 13:56.709
All right? He should be
hosting "The Daily Show."

13:56.710 --> 13:57.710
Yes!

13:57.711 --> 14:00.679
Mindy, your water just broke.

14:07.053 --> 14:08.187
Oh, God.

14:08.188 --> 14:09.188
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:09.189 --> 14:10.689
This cannot be
happening right now.

14:10.690 --> 14:12.791
- I had a plan.
- Yeah, me too!

14:12.792 --> 14:14.660
God, I was supposed to
be at the Expo right now,

14:14.661 --> 14:16.795
networking with other
business Morgans.

14:16.796 --> 14:18.664
Ah, I'm starting to feel
a little bad that I ever

14:18.665 --> 14:20.099
messed with your birth
control in the first place.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.901
- What?
- I still ain't moving.

14:25.772 --> 14:28.307
Sorry, folks.
We have a slight delay.

14:28.308 --> 14:30.576
Apparently a man has
fallen onto the tracks

14:30.577 --> 14:33.379
while filming a viral
video of some kind.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.714
Well, just run him over,
for God's sakes!

14:35.715 --> 14:38.784
We will update you on
the premise of the viral video

14:38.785 --> 14:40.653
when we have more information.

14:40.654 --> 14:42.021
Thank you for riding the MTA.

14:42.022 --> 14:43.455
It's gonna be a song parody.

14:43.456 --> 14:46.325
Okay, Mindy,
you're going to have this baby

14:46.326 --> 14:47.893
right now on this subway.

14:47.894 --> 14:49.295
Oh, my God!

14:49.296 --> 14:50.696
A subway baby?

14:50.697 --> 14:52.131
You're gonna be on
"The Ellen Show!"

14:52.132 --> 14:53.565
Sheena was in the audience once,

14:53.566 --> 14:55.901
and she got some Omaha
steaks and a pair of Tom's.

14:55.902 --> 14:57.469
- No, no, no, no, thanks.
- Up, up, get up now.

14:57.470 --> 14:58.971
Thank you.
I won't be needing your help.

14:58.972 --> 15:00.739
I'm just gonna keep
my legs closed,

15:00.740 --> 15:01.740
and wait till we get
to the Javits Center.

15:01.741 --> 15:02.875
- Shh.
- Thanks.

15:02.876 --> 15:05.711
Everyone stay calm.
She's in good hands.

15:05.712 --> 15:07.513
Although my techniques
are designed for younger

15:07.514 --> 15:08.814
and more athletic women,

15:08.815 --> 15:11.183
this one is going to have
her baby the Paleo way.

15:11.184 --> 15:13.720
- You can do it, Mindy!
- Shh, we don't know that yet.

15:16.356 --> 15:17.990
- Hey.
- Danny!

15:17.991 --> 15:19.325
Thank God you're here.

15:19.326 --> 15:20.959
Okay, if there are people
you don't recognize

15:20.960 --> 15:22.428
at the dinner table,

15:22.429 --> 15:24.630
I've hired some improv actors
to play my other friends.

15:24.631 --> 15:27.099
One of them...
I have no idea why...

15:27.100 --> 15:28.534
is doing a surfer dude.

15:28.535 --> 15:29.836
Okay.

15:31.638 --> 15:33.205
Danny, hello? What's wrong?

15:33.206 --> 15:35.074
What's happening?
What's the matter?

15:35.075 --> 15:36.275
Have I a booger?

15:36.276 --> 15:37.443
No, you're fine. Look...

15:37.444 --> 15:38.444
- Sure?
- Yeah.

15:38.445 --> 15:39.878
I just got this
crazy woman pregnant

15:39.879 --> 15:41.180
and now she wants to check out

15:41.181 --> 15:43.782
for the most important
moment in her life.

15:43.783 --> 15:47.286
Well, maybe it's
because she's terrified.

15:47.287 --> 15:48.721
Terrified?

15:48.722 --> 15:50.856
Of what, a little pain?
No, that's not Mindy.

15:50.857 --> 15:53.192
I mean, just last week,
she spent the whole day

15:53.193 --> 15:54.593
with a dart in her shoulder.

15:54.594 --> 15:57.229
Danny, whenever Mindy gets
scared of doing something hard,

15:57.230 --> 15:59.131
she always tries to pretend
like it's not happening.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.699
Like that time
she stole all that Oxy

16:00.700 --> 16:02.901
because she was afraid
to get a Brazilian.

16:02.902 --> 16:04.603
She's scared, Danny.

16:04.604 --> 16:06.605
Yeah.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.974
I mean, she hasn't been to
the dentist in, like, 10 years.

16:08.975 --> 16:11.677
The other day we were kissing
and a tooth came right out.

16:11.678 --> 16:12.911
I swallowed it.

16:12.912 --> 16:14.513
That's the worst
thing I've ever heard.

16:16.549 --> 16:18.084
What's up? Who's that?

16:21.287 --> 16:23.422
What's wrong?

16:23.423 --> 16:25.190
You bet... no, no, no, no.
You better not be leaving.

16:30.930 --> 16:32.298
- What?
