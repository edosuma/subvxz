00:16.600 --> 00:18.935
After monster Wuba was set
free by his human parents,

00:18.936 --> 00:21.646
Wuba and other monsters
moved into the wilderness.

00:21.647 --> 00:25.275
But every day, Wuba yearns
for his papa and mama.

00:39.581 --> 00:43.251
<i>Don't think too much.
Don't worry too much.</i>

00:43.252 --> 00:46.837
<i>Everything is great today,
now is the time to dance!</i>

00:46.838 --> 00:50.466
<i>You are my friends. You are my families.</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:54.136
<i>With this joyful song,
now is the time to dance!</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:57.723
<i>It doesn't matter where you're from,</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:01.143
<i>you're welcome to share our happiness.</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:04.813
<i>Dance along! Shake your body!</i>

01:04.815 --> 01:08.610
<i>Taste the sweetness of our cheerful joy.</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:21.247
<i>Move your limbs. Then you
will feel wonderful.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:24.792
<i>Join us this moment. Now
is the time to dance!</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:28.421
<i>He-ya-He-ya-Pi-ya...
Pi-ya-Xie-ya-Xie-ya.</i>

01:28.422 --> 01:30.089
<i>Hey-ya-Hey-ya-Za-ya...

01:30.090 --> 01:31.883
<i>Now is the time to dance!</i>

01:32.009 --> 01:35.530
<i>It doesn't matter where you're from,</i>

01:35.554 --> 01:39.140
<i>you're welcome to share our happiness.</i>

01:39.141 --> 01:42.727
<i>Dance along! Shake your body!</i>

01:42.728 --> 01:46.564
<i>Taste the sweetness of our cheerful joy.</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:50.444
<i>This is the way to dance.</i>

01:53.447 --> 01:56.301
I look slimmer without the human skin!

01:56.325 --> 01:58.744
Did you lose weight?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.632
What's this?

02:12.591 --> 02:14.009
A giant monster!

02:14.885 --> 02:16.093
Sent by the evil Monster King!

02:16.094 --> 02:17.179
A giant monster!

02:17.638 --> 02:18.388
Where's Wuba?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.181
Protect Wuba!

02:22.517 --> 02:23.727
Wuba.

02:24.728 --> 02:25.729
Wuba.

02:28.982 --> 02:29.983
Another one.

02:32.110 --> 02:32.819
Darling!

02:32.819 --> 02:33.779
I'll protect you!

02:34.946 --> 02:36.239
More!

02:46.416 --> 02:48.585
A four-winged monster!

02:49.461 --> 02:50.671
Honey, swing me!

02:51.254 --> 02:52.255
Catch!

02:53.715 --> 02:54.591
Don't think about it!

03:04.851 --> 03:05.727
Xiao Wu,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.271
Catch!

03:08.939 --> 03:09.856
Gao!

03:14.152 --> 03:15.153
I got it.

03:22.035 --> 03:22.911
Incoming!

03:30.377 --> 03:31.545
Header!

03:37.676 --> 03:39.094
Gotcha!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.076
Go, Auntie Mo.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.663
Hold tight!

04:06.664 --> 04:08.081
Don't let it fly away!

04:09.458 --> 04:10.852
Hang in there!

04:10.876 --> 04:12.544
We can't hold anymore!

04:12.669 --> 04:13.730
Hang in there!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.839
Yang, Our turn!

04:38.904 --> 04:41.907
Gao, did Wuba get away?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.117
He did.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.287
I hope he'll be alright.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.414
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Barr reporting for duty, Your Majesty!

04:50.415 --> 04:53.084
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Those idiots,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.546
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Can't even capture a little monster.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.507
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Barr,

04:58.673 --> 05:03.678
<i>Monster Language.</i>
I now order you to find me that thing.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.974
<i>Monster Language.</i>
You must bring it back alive!

05:08.558 --> 05:13.188
<i>Monster Language.</i> I want to see what is
so special about this little monster.

05:13.396 --> 05:17.858
<i>Monster Language.</i> that may change
the human and monster worlds.

05:17.859 --> 05:22.197
<i>Monster Language.</i> I will get the job done,
Your Majesty.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.858
I'm seeing vision again.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.619
My master is blind and
dumb, but he can hear.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.957
He said he has never felt
such a strange pulse.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.209
It's like all the gynecological
disorders in the world

06:17.210 --> 06:18.837
thrown into one body.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.134
Master wants to know
which date is your menstrual cycle.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.802
Does it matter?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.053
You're already a mother.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.390
There's no need to be shy.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.642
He's the mother!

06:33.768 --> 06:35.729
On the 15th of each month...

06:37.814 --> 06:39.024
I eat vegan.

06:39.357 --> 06:39.983
Doc.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.902
I'm totally fine.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.527
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.987
Ever since he gave birth,

06:44.988 --> 06:47.281
he's been depressed and losing sleep.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.700
Can you cure him, Doc?

06:50.911 --> 06:51.578
He said,

06:51.579 --> 06:54.414
he's never treated a man
for postpartum depression.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.707
Just treat him like a woman.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.376
That's how I treat him.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.879
When do you usually feel depressed?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.090
When he thinks of the moment
he sent his son away.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.849
The problem is all in your mind.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.746
Take this and boil it

07:37.624 --> 07:38.916
with three bowls of water...

07:38.917 --> 07:40.627
Can I add more water?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.338
It'll be easier to swallow.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.257
Master said, you
must be delirious!

07:47.258 --> 07:48.926
Master wants you

07:48.927 --> 07:51.220
to pour it out after it's boiled.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.930
Then place incense on it.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.473
Your mind is ill.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.183
You should pray to the
sun for positive energy!

07:56.184 --> 07:57.102
Next!

08:12.367 --> 08:13.368
I think

08:13.535 --> 08:16.037
you'd be fine if Wuba was still with us.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.015
Careful.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.499
That was close.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.675
Reveal your true form, monster!

08:32.511 --> 08:33.761
Where's the little monster?

08:33.763 --> 08:36.140
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.392
Freeze!

09:01.791 --> 09:02.625
Get her!

09:41.247 --> 09:42.207
Are you alright?

09:42.208 --> 09:43.792
Fine.
Please hold this for me.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.102
My son!

11:05.373 --> 11:08.418
How awesome!

11:36.029 --> 11:37.238
Thanks for the help.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.907
Are you hurt?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.743
<i>Monster Hunter Bureau.</i>

11:42.744 --> 11:44.329
Are you from the Monster Hunter Bureau?

11:48.917 --> 11:50.335
Are you hunters too?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.002
We're just small potatoes.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.086
I'm Tianyin Song.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.338
This is my wife Xiaolan.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.422

11:55.423 --> 11:58.134

11:58.885 --> 12:00.886
Sorry, I have to get back.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.471
You keep up the good work.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.556
Take care.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.936
Amazing!

12:10.688 --> 12:12.023
You know...

12:12.857 --> 12:14.942
Yun is from the Monster Hunter Bureau.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.401
Since your father is a monster hunter,

12:16.402 --> 12:18.279
perhaps we can find
clues of his whereabouts there.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.863
Then we should pay a visit.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.823
Let's go!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.876
Do you think Wuba is
afraid of thunder?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.045
Wuba is such a troublemaker.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.464
I think the thunder is afraid of him.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.304
When did you make this?

12:43.638 --> 12:45.890
It's not that I don't miss Wuba.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.475
I just think that

12:47.809 --> 12:49.978
monsters and humans can't co-exist yet.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.775
When I talk to the doll,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.778
it makes me feel like Wuba is by my side.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.865
I'm a level ten hunter! Surrender, monster!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.254
Monster!

13:59.255 --> 14:02.175
Capture it!

14:02.550 --> 14:03.801
Monster!

14:04.510 --> 14:06.137
Monster!

14:07.889 --> 14:09.349
Monster!

14:11.809 --> 14:13.978
It's... it's a real monster!

14:15.897 --> 14:16.689
Catch it!

14:16.856 --> 14:17.648
Catch it!

14:17.774 --> 14:21.819
Don't move! Stop running!

14:23.613 --> 14:28.159
<i>Clear Water Town.</i>

14:44.300 --> 14:46.445

14:53.768 --> 14:55.019
Do you see it?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.938
There it is!

14:58.564 --> 14:59.690
Don't let it get away.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.793
Get it!

15:00.817 --> 15:01.734
It's gone!

15:01.734 --> 15:02.527
Get it!

15:02.528 --> 15:06.030
Stop right there!

15:10.910 --> 15:13.495
Where has it gone? I can't find it.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.540
Don't let it get away.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.797
Search everywhere!

15:23.798 --> 15:25.466
Can't find it.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.775
Let's search elsewhere.

15:47.238 --> 15:51.117
It's gone.
Let's go.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.564
15 wins in a row!

17:04.565 --> 17:05.983
What a streak!

17:06.317 --> 17:08.861
For someone who has never lost,

17:09.028 --> 17:11.864
there is no meaning
when you win one more.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.493
Let me help you make it meaningful, then.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.838
One game.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.224
you can leave with your money right now.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.936
I never let an opportunity pass me by.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.437
Let alone...

17:43.854 --> 17:45.356
one as beautiful as you.

It must be to the right. Thanks.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.813
Looks like we've got
a couple of swindlers here.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.316
I have to teach you two a lesson.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.960
Don't sling mud at me.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.819
That thing came out from your side.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.988
Looks like you're the one who is cheating.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.615

Tu? Is that him?

19:23.621 --> 19:24.580
Pay me back!

Don't you run! Stop!

21:02.845 --> 21:04.638
Get him!

21:07.600 --> 21:08.350
Don't you run!

21:08.976 --> 21:10.269
Corner him on the other side!

21:17.067 --> 21:18.420
Go forward!

21:18.444 --> 21:19.779
Damn!

21:33.793 --> 21:34.502
He's gone.

21:34.503 --> 21:35.878
Where is he?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.716
What's this thing?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.423
Back in my day, I fought
ten guys at once.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.569
People called me The Killer!

22:24.593 --> 22:26.554
I was worshipped by many,

22:26.804 --> 22:28.513
not for my amazing skills,

22:28.514 --> 22:29.723
but for my integrity.

22:30.057 --> 22:30.975
We agreed on five rounds,

22:30.976 --> 22:32.518
you played fifteen rounds!

22:33.727 --> 22:35.019
You're throwing the book at me now?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.938
Ten taels for overtime!

22:36.939 --> 22:38.774
Ten taels for my nausea!

22:39.024 --> 22:40.567
You sold me out in there,

22:40.568 --> 22:42.444
so ten taels for mental distress!

22:42.570 --> 22:44.445
I worked overtime
and missed a date with my girl,

22:44.446 --> 22:45.655
two wasted theater tickets...

22:45.656 --> 22:46.824
So it's a total of ten taels then.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.867
Exactly!
You screwed up my game

22:48.868 --> 22:50.327
and you now ask me for money?

22:50.828 --> 22:53.246
I despise greedy people...

22:53.247 --> 22:54.415
and monsters.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.709
Lemme tell ya, whenever I come across one,

22:57.084 --> 22:58.335
I won't show no mercy!

22:58.836 --> 23:00.129
BenBen! Blade!

23:02.673 --> 23:04.215
What's wrong with you?

23:04.216 --> 23:06.302
Who would use something this big
to kill this tiny thing?

23:06.719 --> 23:07.803
Get me the small one.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.971
You said you won't show mercy to

23:09.972 --> 23:11.681
anyone greedy you come across.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.642
You can use this to kill yourself.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.439
At least pay me my wages.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.607
If you don't,

23:20.608 --> 23:22.234
I'll have my girlfriend eat you alive!

23:22.359 --> 23:23.776
My girlfriend is a big girl!

23:23.777 --> 23:24.862
You trying to scare me?

23:25.279 --> 23:26.196
How big can she be?

23:26.488 --> 23:27.614
Is she as big as my head?!

23:27.615 --> 23:28.699
Good.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.116
You wanna be shameless?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.202
Just remember that I'm fearless!
Take it easy.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.078
I'm a dignified man

23:34.079 --> 23:35.789
with a reputation to maintain.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.500
I'll pay you.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.297

23:52.431 --> 23:53.349

You jerk.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.641
You'll pay for this.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.226
And you'll have to pay your share, too.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.686
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Go to hell!

23:58.020 --> 24:00.396
Are you happy being this rude?

24:00.397 --> 24:01.941
You're happy to see me dead.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.196
Yummy.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.448
Where did you get the corn?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.950
At Mama Zhang's stall,
opposite the tofu stand at the market.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.202
When you pass by tomorrow,

24:13.452 --> 24:14.786
bring back some more!

24:14.787 --> 24:17.206
You still owe Mama Zhang 30 taels!

24:17.665 --> 24:19.708
She said, if you don't pay her back,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.252
you will have to marry her third daughter.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.254
You mean Cui?

24:25.047 --> 24:26.423
She's twice your size!

24:26.757 --> 24:28.675
Forget it. Tell Mama Zhang

24:28.676 --> 24:30.052
I'd rather pay her back.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.431
Who are you?

24:37.768 --> 24:39.311
Your secret son?

24:39.603 --> 24:41.188
We just met.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.447
Stop babbling!

24:51.198 --> 24:52.282
You're eating my corn.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.909
And you're giving me attitude?!

24:56.912 --> 24:58.706
Farewell, little one!

25:51.425 --> 25:52.342

26:03.979 --> 26:06.314
That monster is just a child!

26:06.315 --> 26:07.232
Right.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.153
Thank you!

26:11.154 --> 26:13.072
Next, Hunter Zhang.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.242
The Monster Hunter Bureau is rich!

26:18.619 --> 26:19.787
Thanks!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.205
Actually,

26:21.455 --> 26:22.956
I ought to be a level three hunter by now.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.542
The wage should be pretty good.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.211
I should get promoted, too.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.047
You?

26:30.714 --> 26:32.049
You should stick to giving birth.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.375
Oh, excuse me then.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.419
A lady?
We're just looking around.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.004
Wait.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.426
I am...

27:16.677 --> 27:17.594
...the Workshop Master?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.053
How did you know?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.889
You fix weapons?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.975
And your weapon needs fixing?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.019
How did you know?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.439
Did it get damaged in a monster hunt?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.108
How did you know?

27:34.027 --> 27:35.195
Guess how I knew?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.781
I...
I guess you don't need to know.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.533
Should I talk to someone else,

27:39.783 --> 27:40.993
or can you really fix it?

27:41.785 --> 27:42.910
This damaged whip

27:42.911 --> 27:45.038
is the proof of your
ignorance and shallowness.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.666
Why didn't you take good care of it?

27:48.250 --> 27:49.751
This is absolutely not fixable.

27:50.752 --> 27:51.670
Never mind him.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.214
I think you are special.

27:54.882 --> 27:55.757
Really?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.176
You look like...

27:57.301 --> 27:59.760
you haven't washed your hair in two months.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.304
It shows that

28:01.305 --> 28:02.722
you don't get caught in small things.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.349
You only care about the big picture!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.143
Gimme that!

28:06.643 --> 28:08.187
I was the one who damaged the whip.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.771
It's mine.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.356
My lady,

28:12.774 --> 28:14.276
I feel like we understand each other.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.237
Since this is yours,

28:19.031 --> 28:21.282
somehow that inspires me,
I've suddenly thought of a way to fix it.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.076
I knew you can do it!

28:24.244 --> 28:26.330
I sense that we share a connection.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.207
Alright.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.251
The paper soldiers want new weapons, too.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.213
Whatever the lady
wants, the lady gets.

28:34.922 --> 28:35.964
After all, a kindred spirit

28:36.965 --> 28:38.258
is hard to find.

See you around! Thank you!

28:45.682 --> 28:46.934
Please get my whip fixed soon!

28:52.356 --> 28:55.400
Hey, were you not
happy just now?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.194
How did you know?

28:59.905 --> 29:01.823
Because we share a connection.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.554
Why don't you connect with him instead?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.163
You're jealous!

29:08.747 --> 29:09.665
Jealous!

29:09.666 --> 29:11.500
<i>Zhu's Bank of Gold.</i>

29:30.185 --> 29:31.603
Boss Zhu,

29:33.188 --> 29:34.064
how have you been?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.898
When you owe me money,

29:35.899 --> 29:37.252
you call me Boss Zhu.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.610
When you want to borrow money,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.320
you call me Little Zhu.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.071
Which one is the real me

29:42.072 --> 29:43.615
in that heart of yours?

29:44.199 --> 29:45.409
I have another question,

29:45.575 --> 29:46.952
and you better answer honestly...

29:47.160 --> 29:48.120
When will I pay you, right?

29:48.328 --> 29:49.121
Wrong.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.295
When's our wedding?

29:58.839 --> 30:00.507
"If his debt isn't paid in three months,

30:01.008 --> 30:02.008
Little Tutu...

30:02.009 --> 30:05.053
will marry his beloved Little Zhu."

30:05.637 --> 30:07.639
You signed this marriage agreement

30:07.848 --> 30:10.100
and you even sealed it with a kiss.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.770
You got me drunk and made me sign it.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.439
I thought it was an IOU!

30:15.647 --> 30:17.024
I don't care about the money.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.109
I've checked the calendar

30:19.526 --> 30:20.651
and today

30:20.652 --> 30:23.946
is a perfect day for a wedding.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.574
Not today!

30:26.116 --> 30:27.743
We have to run this by
our parents and a matchmaker.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.095
This ain't right yet!

30:29.119 --> 30:31.663
You just don't want to marry me, do you?

30:32.748 --> 30:33.957
You are a straight up

30:34.416 --> 30:35.542
scum!

30:45.302 --> 30:47.846
Pick your favorite girl.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.313
I can pick anyone I like?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.148
You can pick me, too.

<i>Marry me.</i>

31:20.337 --> 31:22.756
<i>Hair dressing.</i>

31:23.840 --> 31:24.859

31:26.676 --> 31:27.886
Sure.

31:39.856 --> 31:40.482
Speak!

31:40.607 --> 31:41.691
When will you settle your debt?

31:42.442 --> 31:44.485
I truly want to pay you back.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.196
But I don't have the money.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.115

31:48.824 --> 31:49.907
pick another girl.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.166
How about...

31:58.625 --> 31:59.501
her!

32:18.979 --> 32:20.021
Stop the massage!

32:20.397 --> 32:22.274
Three days! I'll pay up in three days!

32:23.316 --> 32:24.985
If I don't, I'll let you

32:27.571 --> 32:28.714
tear me apart

32:28.738 --> 32:30.073
and parade me down Main Street!

32:32.200 --> 32:33.201
Boss.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.328
Those who claimed to have
found the little monster are here.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.438
Go away!

33:02.314 --> 33:03.190
Boss!

33:03.191 --> 33:04.816
Tu may die from laughing too hard.

33:06.985 --> 33:07.861
Stop!

33:11.740 --> 33:13.742
If he dies,

33:14.159 --> 33:15.410
Who's gonna marry me?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.747
Who's gonna marry me?

33:18.955 --> 33:20.832
This is what I want!

33:21.958 --> 33:23.710
Not these!

33:26.129 --> 33:27.964
You're looking for that tiny guy, too?

33:28.256 --> 33:30.133
The one that babbles "wuba wuba"?

33:30.300 --> 33:31.426
Do you know where it is?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.196
We're bosom buddies!

33:33.220 --> 33:34.638
We hang out all the time!

33:36.681 --> 33:37.807
Bring it to me.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.518
Then we can renegotiate

33:40.101 --> 33:41.019
our deal.

33:45.232 --> 33:48.026
<i>Memorial Hall.</i>

34:18.681 --> 34:19.891

34:20.058 --> 34:21.393
How could you climb over memorial tablets?!

34:21.685 --> 34:22.518
Xiaolan!

34:24.103 --> 34:25.188
It's my father.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.817
Hey, don't touch that!

34:32.404 --> 34:33.797
How dare you trespass on sacred grounds?!

34:33.822 --> 34:34.882
That's my father's tablet!

34:34.906 --> 34:37.492
Yeah, that's my father-in-law's tablet.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.790
Brother Yun.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.166
Yun.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.212
You're Daitian Song's son?

34:50.672 --> 34:52.632
You know my father?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.009
He's my senior.

34:55.927 --> 34:56.969
This is my father's sword.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.598
It proves that I'm his son.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.226
It's true.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.687
You do have his eyes.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.314
Is my father...

35:07.689 --> 35:09.107
already dead?

35:11.901 --> 35:13.421
Brother Song went missing ten years ago

35:13.445 --> 35:14.779
in Clear Water Town.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.867
No one knows whether
he's alive or dead.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.454
Tianyin and I have searched far and wide.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.788
But all this time,

35:24.789 --> 35:26.291
we still couldn't find him.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.628
<i>Monster Hunter Records.</i>

35:30.629 --> 35:32.671
This is your dad's monster hunting records.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.675
I think it may help
you to know more.

35:35.842 --> 35:36.718
Brother Yun,

35:37.052 --> 35:38.553
whether I find him or not,

35:38.845 --> 35:40.055
I'm truly grateful for your help.

35:40.430 --> 35:41.598
We are all monster hunters,

35:41.765 --> 35:42.641
that makes us brothers.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.728
The fact that Brother Song
hasn't returned means

35:46.895 --> 35:49.689
the conflict between humans and monsters
hasn't been solved.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.736
But it is not easy for
any of us to resolve this.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.822
Legend says that
a little monster

35:58.114 --> 36:00.617
can change the situation.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.410
A little monster?

36:02.535 --> 36:05.789
It's the son of the
former Monster King.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.791
It has hair like grass

36:08.291 --> 36:10.752
and it makes a sound when it's happy.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.004
Wuba.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.297
Wuba.

36:14.964 --> 36:15.924
But...

36:16.299 --> 36:17.717
he's gone missing as well.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.096
What can we do, then?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.517
Wait, I've just thought of an idea.

36:26.017 --> 36:26.976
Perhaps we can try that.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.733
<i>Monster Tracking Pavilion.</i>

36:40.281 --> 36:41.616
This is the Sand Dune of Longing.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.345
Monster Hunters use this to track monsters.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.747
When a monster longs
for its family,

36:47.872 --> 36:49.624
it creates a power that will

36:50.041 --> 36:51.918
show the location of the one it yearns for.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.044
Can humans use it too?

36:53.503 --> 36:54.939
I've never tried that.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.381
Or...

36:56.506 --> 36:58.717
if there's someone that you yearn for,

36:59.592 --> 37:00.802
you can give it a try.

37:01.094 --> 37:01.970
Brother Yun,

37:04.472 --> 37:06.099
we've lost the spiky,

37:06.266 --> 37:07.243
but we just caught its mother

37:07.267 --> 37:08.435
in the neighborhood.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.858
Spiky monsters are dangerous to humans,

37:15.108 --> 37:16.943
they must be eliminated!

37:56.858 --> 37:58.067
My son!

38:07.869 --> 38:08.870
It's Tianshu Forest!

38:09.245 --> 38:10.914
Hunters, let's go!

38:11.331 --> 38:12.540
Brother Yun,

38:12.957 --> 38:14.417
can we tag along?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.184
Spiky.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.395
Your mother is worried sick!

38:43.988 --> 38:46.991
You... met... my mother?

38:48.076 --> 38:49.160
At the Monster Hunter Bureau.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.996
I saved... a human... why catch... me?

38:52.205 --> 38:53.140
You saved a human?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.082
Who did you save?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.353
Are you here to kill him or catch him?

39:15.812 --> 39:16.813
There's no difference.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.359
Stop!

39:29.868 --> 39:30.535
Brother Yun!

39:32.245 --> 39:33.371
Which one of you hit my husband?!

39:35.415 --> 39:36.416
Uh...

39:37.250 --> 39:38.042
Don't let it go.

39:38.585 --> 39:39.627
Brother Yun!

39:39.961 --> 39:41.897
Spiky said he did what
he did to save humans.

39:41.921 --> 39:42.839
Monsters are full of lies.

39:42.964 --> 39:45.150
It deserves to die for
destroying the monster traps.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.235
There are good and bad people,

39:46.259 --> 39:47.719
and the same goes for monsters.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.139
Let's get some answers first.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.525
We won't hurt you.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.403
Tell me, who did you save?

40:05.945 --> 40:08.072
Hunters. Traps.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.409
Hurt children. I saved!

40:12.076 --> 40:14.621
They said. I destroy.

40:14.954 --> 40:15.955
Want to kill me.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.091
Brother Yun, Spiky is hurt.

40:27.342 --> 40:28.485
If we bring him back,

40:28.509 --> 40:30.553
can you promise not to
hurt him and his mother?

40:30.845 --> 40:33.431
The Bureau will make a fair judgement.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.022
Do you know...

40:42.899 --> 40:44.734
that your mom misses you so?

40:58.539 --> 40:59.791
Do you know...

41:01.459 --> 41:02.794
ever since you left,

41:03.670 --> 41:05.838
I have been terrified that
I may never see you again?

41:22.814 --> 41:25.817
There's no greater pain in this world

41:26.109 --> 41:28.403
than being separated from family.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.787
That's why

41:38.538 --> 41:40.081
you can't leave her.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.792
Come back with us.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.086
Go back to your mother.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.005
Okay?

42:07.984 --> 42:09.527
Wuba Wuba!

42:09.944 --> 42:10.903
Wuba!

42:14.699 --> 42:17.076
I've always said that
you should be more forgiving.

42:17.618 --> 42:18.828
That little radish is so cute.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.305
Why can't he stay with us?

42:20.329 --> 42:21.831
And you forced me to get rid of him.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.374
You're so coldblooded!

42:23.750 --> 42:24.876
<i>Monster Language.</i> Go to hell!

42:25.376 --> 42:26.544
Why are you yelling at me?

42:26.919 --> 42:27.962
If you wholeheartedly wanted him to stay,

42:28.129 --> 42:29.773
why didn't you stop me?

42:29.797 --> 42:31.758
You gotta learn to grow some backbone.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.634
Please don't sell Wuba.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.928
I think Wuba is looking for his family.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.722
What do we get out of that?

42:38.097 --> 42:40.641
Lemme tell you,
other than money,

42:40.808 --> 42:41.893
don't trust anything else in this world.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.228
How can I settle my debts
if I don't sell Wuba?

42:44.937 --> 42:46.415
Do you want Zhu to kill me?

42:46.439 --> 42:47.398
She won't kill you.

42:47.732 --> 42:48.816
She fancies you!

42:49.067 --> 42:52.278
Just marry her, then
Mama Zhang's daughter

42:52.487 --> 42:53.738
will be out of the picture.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.908
You're speaking gibberish.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.669
Wuba Wuba!

43:14.133 --> 43:15.426
Stupid BenBen,

43:16.010 --> 43:17.512
playing hide and seek again?

43:19.305 --> 43:20.932
Wait 'til I catch you.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.696
Little radish!

43:35.988 --> 43:37.406
There you are.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.618
It's been a while.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.078
I really miss you.

43:43.079 --> 43:45.248
You know, I'm here to
take you to your parents.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.251
Are you hungry?

44:01.430 --> 44:03.432
How can you spit on the
person who feeds you?

44:04.058 --> 44:05.058
I have to teach you a lesson!

44:05.059 --> 44:06.935
Why are you trying to hit him again?

44:06.936 --> 44:09.771
Monsters only spit on the ones they like.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.773
But why would he like you?

44:11.774 --> 44:13.275
I should be the one he spits on!

44:13.276 --> 44:15.987
Wuba Wuba, are you
out of your mind?

44:17.864 --> 44:20.783
<i>Monster Language.</i> Mom, Mom...

44:22.410 --> 44:25.621
<i>Monster Language.</i>
Mom's right here, don't worry.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.504
Even though they're locked up,

44:34.505 --> 44:36.465
they can still be happy
when they're together.

44:40.595 --> 44:41.846
What are you looking at?

44:42.388 --> 44:43.973
I'm thinking...

44:44.223 --> 44:46.184
how do we set them free?

44:48.060 --> 44:49.477
Look at them.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.104
I don't think they care.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.272
What if we let them go

44:52.273 --> 44:54.459
and they get caught by other people?

44:54.483 --> 44:56.319
Are they any safer here?

45:31.812 --> 45:33.022
I have an idea.

45:36.359 --> 45:39.654
Why did you set them free?

45:41.989 --> 45:44.282
You've been drinking!

45:44.283 --> 45:45.534
Uh...

45:47.370 --> 45:48.913
Higher.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.416
It should be lower!
Higher will look more noble.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.708
It should be lower.

45:53.709 --> 45:54.919
Stop it!

45:56.504 --> 45:58.547
Is this a flower arrangement?

46:04.428 --> 46:06.055
That's perfect.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.865
You miss again!

46:25.199 --> 46:26.784
Go left!

46:28.577 --> 46:31.914
Levitating objects
takes concentration.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.754
Tianyin!

46:39.046 --> 46:40.565
What are you thinking?

46:40.589 --> 46:42.925
Did you turn dumb after giving birth?

46:43.676 --> 46:45.303
I'm not thinking about anything.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.601
I'll teach Tu a lesson for you.

46:53.019 --> 46:55.312
Wuba, do you know

46:55.313 --> 46:57.480
when a baby monster

46:57.481 --> 46:58.982
screams out in fear,

46:58.983 --> 47:00.526
who will come to rescue?

47:03.904 --> 47:06.239
Anyone that's been spat
on by a baby monster.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.033
When a baby monster screams,

47:07.034 --> 47:09.660
that person will see what the monster sees.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.921
I've found the little monster.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.716
Let's talk business.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.474
What the... you...

47:33.893 --> 47:35.353
You're so beautiful.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.438
I know.

47:40.483 --> 47:42.234
Gimme a kiss first.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.864
What's with you?

47:49.909 --> 47:51.160
You don't like it?

47:53.245 --> 47:56.916
I like the way you're
looking at me today.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.835
A girl could use some compliments.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.962
Just a few nice words will do.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.093
What the devil?!

48:08.094 --> 48:09.553
Gross!

48:13.766 --> 48:14.849
You can say no to the kiss

48:14.850 --> 48:16.727
instead of hitting me in the face.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.187
How dare you disrespect our boss?!

48:19.188 --> 48:20.815
You called her a devil!

48:24.485 --> 48:25.693
I'm sorry.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.238
I didn't mean it,

48:27.780 --> 48:29.072
but I just saw

48:29.073 --> 48:31.659
something that's even grosser than you.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.201
What?!

48:33.202 --> 48:35.037
Since you don't love me,

48:36.080 --> 48:37.539
then hand over the radish.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.915
We can skip the negotiation.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.543
I think female devils
are just gorgeous.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.337
That's what I meant.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.799
You're heavenly in my eyes.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.678
Do you honestly

48:50.928 --> 48:52.346
like the way I look?

48:53.222 --> 48:54.598
I love it!

49:01.981 --> 49:03.274
Your face today

49:03.732 --> 49:05.234
has the resemblance of...

49:09.697 --> 49:11.031
a butt!

49:11.574 --> 49:13.159
Don't point your butt at me!

49:16.912 --> 49:18.706
Why'd you call my face a butt?

49:24.628 --> 49:26.880
Boss, I'll cut out his tongue.

49:26.881 --> 49:27.964
He's clearly blind.

49:27.965 --> 49:29.382
I should gouge out his eyeballs.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.508
Tongue first!

49:30.509 --> 49:31.760
Eyeballs first!

49:31.927 --> 49:33.679
You've really pissed me off!

49:35.723 --> 49:38.809
I actually do think that
you're gorgeous today,

49:39.101 --> 49:41.269
but I honestly did see a butt just now!

49:41.270 --> 49:43.062
A butt with two little legs!

49:43.063 --> 49:45.523
Do I look like an idiot?

49:45.524 --> 49:46.983
I'd rather trust a devil

49:46.984 --> 49:48.777
than that mouth of yours!

49:49.403 --> 49:51.238
If I can't have you,

49:51.655 --> 49:53.239
nobody will!

49:53.240 --> 49:54.282
Calm down!

49:54.283 --> 49:56.784
You can have the little
radish for free.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.871
If you lie to me again,

49:59.455 --> 50:00.748
I'm going to...

50:03.334 --> 50:05.169
cut out your roots!

50:25.981 --> 50:28.359
It's you who have been messing with me!

50:37.451 --> 50:40.119
I remember the old wound
on your shoulder.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.621
It's time that you should get it fixed.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.415
Let me give you a rub.

50:48.671 --> 50:50.129
Why are you

50:50.130 --> 50:52.299
so aggressive today?

50:54.718 --> 50:55.970
Have a seat.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.472
Take a break.
I'll be right back.

51:01.183 --> 51:02.476
What's up with him?

51:10.776 --> 51:13.403
Stupid BenBen, think
you can fool me?

51:13.404 --> 51:15.406
I just don't want you to sell Wuba!

51:16.657 --> 51:18.534
Did I just see what he saw?

51:18.784 --> 51:20.118
Yep.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.869
How could that have happened?

51:21.870 --> 51:23.789
Since he spat on you,

51:24.081 --> 51:26.124
you can see what he sees

51:26.125 --> 51:28.043
when he screams loud.

51:33.757 --> 51:35.342
I saw Wuba's hands!

51:42.641 --> 51:44.017
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

51:44.018 --> 51:45.436
You never asked.

51:52.401 --> 51:53.777
Little Zhu.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.778
One day.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.238
Give me one more day.

51:57.239 --> 51:59.074
I'll bring the little
monster to you tomorrow.

51:59.408 --> 52:03.119
I'm done believing you.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.913
Lies are all you have!

52:12.588 --> 52:14.256
Why would I lie to you?

52:16.759 --> 52:18.010
Trust me!

52:24.224 --> 52:26.934
Can you... lend me
100 taels more?

52:26.935 --> 52:28.562
I'll sign another vow for you.

52:29.438 --> 52:30.773
What should we do?

52:30.898 --> 52:32.523
"Little Tutu

52:32.524 --> 52:33.775
will love.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.318
Little Zhu

52:35.319 --> 52:37.279
forever and ever."

52:45.120 --> 52:47.998
<i>Love.</i>

53:02.388 --> 53:03.681
Love you.

53:16.568 --> 53:18.487
Fooled again.

53:18.821 --> 53:21.155
Boss, he's lying again!

53:21.156 --> 53:22.366
You're wrong!

53:22.783 --> 53:24.242
Look at his eyes.

53:24.243 --> 53:25.993
Listen to his heartbeat.

53:25.994 --> 53:27.662
And look at the vow

53:27.663 --> 53:29.081
that he wrote me.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.210
Look, boss!

53:34.169 --> 53:36.129
<i>Little Tutu is indebted to Little
Zhu forever.</i> He got you again.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.048
I have it on record, boss.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.387
How many times is it now?

53:45.389 --> 53:46.682
Boss.

53:52.271 --> 53:55.816
Well, then.

53:56.358 --> 53:59.153
Don't be so sad, boss.

54:01.155 --> 54:03.073
You know nothing about love.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.452
Get some classy paper

54:07.453 --> 54:09.246
and we'll start a new count!

54:11.957 --> 54:13.666
Wuba... sounds like "winning hands".

54:13.667 --> 54:14.876
With a name like that,

54:14.877 --> 54:17.045
you're joining me on the mahjong table.

54:24.887 --> 54:30.684
<i>Tu owes a kid three silvers,
he should be "kurzed".</i>

54:31.185 --> 54:33.352
It's just a pair of hands.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.146
Maybe it's not Wuba's.

54:35.147 --> 54:36.690
Relax.

54:37.566 --> 54:39.567
You know, my father wasn't very popular

54:39.568 --> 54:41.069
at the Monster Hunter Bureau.

54:41.403 --> 54:43.112
He freed a lot of monsters.

54:43.113 --> 54:44.990
He only captured the bad ones.

54:45.491 --> 54:47.784
It says here the sword
my father left me

54:47.785 --> 54:49.411
can transform into different sizes.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.205
Once it turns bigger,
it works well on huge monsters.

54:52.206 --> 54:55.793
The magic word is Sulusulu...

54:56.376 --> 54:57.711
Maybe Wuba

54:58.796 --> 55:00.672
is trying to talk to me through my dreams?

55:10.933 --> 55:12.142
Eight Wan.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.523
Nine Wan.

55:19.858 --> 55:20.609
Green dragon.

55:20.610 --> 55:21.610
Pong!

55:22.778 --> 55:24.238
<i>Red Dragon.</i>

55:28.283 --> 55:29.408
I win again!

55:29.409 --> 55:30.576
Again?

55:30.577 --> 55:32.703
How come you are so lucky?
How come you have all the tiles we want?

55:32.704 --> 55:34.121
This can't be.

55:34.122 --> 55:36.166
What the...?

55:40.212 --> 55:41.838
You're in my seat.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.798
On no. Not her.

55:43.799 --> 55:44.966
Cui,

55:44.967 --> 55:46.384
don't you need to help
your mom to sell corns?

55:46.385 --> 55:47.885
How'd you find the time for mahjong?

55:47.886 --> 55:49.470
None of your business!

55:49.471 --> 55:50.681
Hurry!

55:56.854 --> 55:58.146
Eight Wan.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.244
There it is again! I'm seeing things again!

56:12.703 --> 56:13.829
Nine Wan.

56:14.037 --> 56:15.414
What did you see?

56:16.164 --> 56:17.457
Corn!

56:27.676 --> 56:28.886
Pong!

56:31.263 --> 56:32.472
Three Circles!

56:40.772 --> 56:41.899
Nine Wan.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.916
This mustache...

56:59.666 --> 57:00.876
is my lucky charm.

57:01.001 --> 57:02.729
I need the luck!

57:02.753 --> 57:04.421
You look familiar...

57:04.922 --> 57:07.799
except that his nose
isn't as big as yours.

57:14.723 --> 57:15.950
This is a nose of fortune.

57:15.974 --> 57:17.517
It attracts wealth.

57:17.684 --> 57:18.769
You've got the wrong guy.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.023
You are... T...

57:24.691 --> 57:25.376
BenBen!

57:25.400 --> 57:26.234
Tu.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.153
Tu.

57:29.988 --> 57:30.989
Pay me back!

57:32.074 --> 57:33.075
Don't let him get away!

57:39.247 --> 57:40.289
Wuba!

57:40.290 --> 57:41.583
I just saw Wuba!

57:41.750 --> 57:43.418
Tu...

57:44.795 --> 57:46.213
Get him!

57:52.803 --> 57:54.012
Don't move! Tu.

57:58.141 --> 57:59.768
Tu. Don't run!

58:13.407 --> 58:14.074
BenBen!

58:14.282 --> 58:15.242
Hurry up!

58:27.796 --> 58:29.464
Stop!

58:32.884 --> 58:34.344
Don't let him get away!

58:50.861 --> 58:52.487
He's gone.

58:52.738 --> 58:53.655
Split up and find him!

58:54.823 --> 58:57.034
Where's your tiger costume?

58:57.826 --> 58:59.828
Where have you been? Quit slacking.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.681
It's time go get on stage.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.582
Always taking forever with the makeup.

59:04.041 --> 59:04.666
Dear,

59:04.958 --> 59:05.810
when intermission starts,

59:05.834 --> 59:07.020
don't forget to pass out leaflets.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.336
Speed up!

59:32.235 --> 59:33.861
You won't find who you're looking for here.

59:33.862 --> 59:35.530
These are all performers!

59:36.073 --> 59:36.990
You may want to try somewhere else.

59:36.991 --> 59:38.241
Sorry I can't walk you out.

59:39.618 --> 59:40.911
Have a good night!

59:41.119 --> 59:43.872
Be sure to come again
to watch the show!

59:45.332 --> 59:46.517
You're up.

59:46.541 --> 59:47.584
Everyone's waiting!

59:52.089 --> 59:53.673
Get out there!

59:55.425 --> 59:57.219
Quick!

59:57.344 --> 59:58.303
The tiger is here!

59:58.304 --> 01:00:00.764
Lie down.

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:04.768
Get ready!

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.269
Stay still!

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:08.897
Hey, bro.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.541
Go easy, alright?

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:11.483
It's my first time.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.068
What a coincidence.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.486
It's my first time too!

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.072
Crush rock on chest!

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.085
You may want to hit harder.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:31.962
Bingo!

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.265
Bro, don't blame me.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.351
You told me to hit harder.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.062
Get up.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.022
Take him away.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.864
Why are you still out here?

01:00:58.865 --> 01:00:59.865
Hurry!

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.199
What's with the mess?

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.409
Hurry!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:03.535
Get in!

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.422
You again?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.215
Are you a magician or a clown?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:18.966
Business is tough.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.820
I just do what the boss told me to.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:21.720
Hey!

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:23.388
Don't tell me this is
your first time again.

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:25.432
Bro, No worries,

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.808
I've been performing this act

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.351
for 20 years.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.901
Sorry, bro, I
stabbed a bit hard.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.710
Are we done?

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:57.130
Now, I'm going to saw
this man in half.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.761
Help!

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.262
Help!

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:05.805
Help!

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.557
Hey, Stop!

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.727
Stop!

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:11.853
Hey!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.393
He's not really dead.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:19.838
See.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.172
He's fine!

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.099
I'm fine.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.100
Don't cry.

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:33.226
Silly thing.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.551
What a great show.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.802
Look over there.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.721
That little monster.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:11.598
There it is!

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.059
Get it!

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:16.936
Don't let it get away!

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.104
Go!

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:21.941
Tu!

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:22.901
Freeze!

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:26.111
Pay me back!

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.238
Get him!

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.239
Jump.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.742
Don't you run!

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:46.049
We don't really know where Wuba is.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.759
Where could we start?

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:49.969
We don't know where your father is, either,

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.472
but we haven't stopped looking.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.186
Let's calm down first,

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.396
okay?

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.148
Do you really want to find Wuba or not?

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.001
Of course I do.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:06.277
So you just don't believe me, then.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.239
Tianyin,

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:12.325
how can you not believe your wife?!

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:13.993
You said you saw a pair of hands,

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:16.037
then later you said you saw some corn.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.622
How do I believe you?

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:19.707
Fine.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.937
If you trust me, come with me.

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:24.796
If you don't,

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:26.255
then stay away from us

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.590
after I've found Wuba.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.111
I know you miss him.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:31.719
I want him to be with us, too.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:32.971
But Wuba is a monster.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.639
He belongs in the monster world.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.559
He won't be safe here among humans.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.936
I miss him too...

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.396
But protecting him is more important.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.981
How are we protecting him?

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.316
Is it not possible for
him to live in the human world?

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:48.903
Everyone wants to be with family.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.530
You think Wuba is any different?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.657
I'm the one who gave birth to Wuba.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.284
You don't have to be responsible.

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:58.537
Tianyin, you've
crossed the line!

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.330
I'm Wuba's mother, too!

01:05:59.331 --> 01:06:00.498
Outta the way!

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.861
Do you think we've
been walking too fast?

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.572
He's crippled, after all.
He can't possibly catch up, right?

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.511
But why didn't he call out to me?

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:38.620
He could've just yelled,

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.414
I'm sorry, Xiaolan!

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:42.874
Is that so hard?

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.170
I have a good temper.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:49.589
I just lose it once in a while.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:51.132
You agree?

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.220
Do I have a short fuse?

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:07.232
Even though they're locked up,

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.025
they can still be happy
when they're together.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:26.477
This little monster...

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.669
he either spits or slobbers.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.087
Does he has a jaw problem?

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:30.588
Let me hold him.

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:32.131
Don't bother.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.758
You'll wake him up.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:37.845
You should be nicer to him.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.222
All your life,

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.183
no one else has ever shed a tear for you.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.784
I guess we won't make it down tonight.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:38.281
<i>Monster Tracking Pavilion.</i>

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:30.792
Wuba!

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:45.890
Xiaolan.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.156
Let's try this together.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.005
That's...

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:00.590
the hot air balloon?

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:02.258
Wuba's not far from us after all!

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:03.593
He's also in Clear Water Town!

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.812
I'll go in by myself.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.731
I'll be quick!

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.485
Okay-

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.111
But don't stay too long.

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:36.793
I just made this sleigh.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.003
It's perfect for two.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.463
Have a seat.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.090
This is cool.

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:46.219
We...

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.638
I know.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.228
Great job!

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.103
So many weapons!

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:58.123
Thanks!

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.649
We should...
My lady,

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.948
I have something special for you.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:55.787
Thanks for the weapons!

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:56.831
Thanks so much.

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:58.958
Not just the weapons.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.253
You can also have these

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:04.630
popped rice.

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:07.216
Cooked in high temperatures.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:08.718
It's nutritious and crunchy.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.179
They're delicious.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.181
Take this for the road.

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:16.827
Thanks! We gotta go.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.269
Thanks again!
Wait,

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.358
I have something else for you.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.154
It's portable and multi-purpose.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.597
Use it to shoot out spells
to attack monsters.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.581
Or use it to cook rice.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:41.417
You can even use it
as a salt shaker.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.461
You're truly talented.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.880
Such an imaginative inventor!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.191
Thank you, but we
really have to go.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:48.883
Thanks!

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:50.384
Lady,

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.386
actually, I...
Stop right there.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.805
I know what you're saying. I get it.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.809
I, I, I, I get it too!

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.860
I don't get it.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:13.950
Hot air balloon!

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.561
Let's try that way.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.535
What do we do now?

01:14:58.452 --> 01:14:59.412
What else can we do?

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.788
Let's hit the gambling tables!

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:03.374
You could've opened a casino
with the money you've lost!

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.376
Never mind.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.105
Where is he?

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.568
What should we do now?

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.530
Wuba needs to pee!

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.831
You've lost weight!

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.754
We're sorry, Wuba.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:15.756
We shouldn't have left you.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.132
We won't leave you again!

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.551
Never again!

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.265
Wuba,

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.599
I'm sorry.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:26.559
Don't cry.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:27.892
We'll never be apart.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.687
I promise we'll always be together!

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.286
Gimme that!

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:47.830
What are you doing?

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.081
Give Wuba back to us!

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.208
Mr. Tiger,

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.169
Wuba is our son.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.545
You're human and he's a monster.

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:56.754
How can he be your son?

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:59.109
You might as well call
me the son of the cousin

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.300
of the husband of the 18th sister

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:01.594
of the Heavenly Father!

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:04.637
Pay your debt, Tu!

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.849
Pay your debt!

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:11.979
Finders keepers.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.815
If you want him, Pay up!

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.652
How much do you want?

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:19.754
A thousand taels.

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:20.696
What?!

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.198
What's your problem?

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:23.532
Whose side are you on here?

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:26.284
Don't think that I don't know
about this little monster.

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:28.037
There are people who will pay more.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:30.455
We don't have that much money with us.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.726
But... the Monster
Hunter Bureau does.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.751
Monster Hunter Bureau?

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:37.630
Is this a trap?

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.649
What trap?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.218
You want money and
we want Wuba back.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.802
Shall we?

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.266
Alright.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.493
I'll trust you for now.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:52.728
If I owe you money, come along!

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:55.105
Let's go.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.341
A thousand taels?

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:24.260
No discount.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.387
We want that big one, too.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:28.657
He's sold by weight.

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.015
A thousand taels per kilo.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.093
Let's go, BenBen.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.929
I don't want to go with you.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.474
You've got your money,

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.144
you don't need me anymore.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:26.447
Fine.

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.574
I'll be just fine.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.492
I don't need anyone.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.121
See you never.

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:44.506
Brother Yun,

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:45.674
thank you

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.259
for getting our family back together.

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:50.888
Brother Yun?

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:58.311
This monster doesn't
belong to the human world.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:20:59.998
I'm taking him away.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.523
He belongs in the monster world.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.068
Wuba!

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:18.624
The monster world?

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.292
I know the way.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:22.461
But I need a carriage to take you.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:23.980
I know where to get one.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:24.922
Follow me.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.758
You're really something, Tu!

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.889
Finally got my money back.
You owe me three coins!

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:43.315
Wow, we're rich!

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:44.566
This is for you,

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:45.901
and this is yours!

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:47.986
Let's get candy!

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.045
Believe in your luck!

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:08.507
Your jackpot is on the way!

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:11.259
This way please, sir.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.846
<i>Casino.</i>

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.191
You are supposed to be a prince.
As a prince,

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.944
is this how you should behave?

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:33.699
What are you doing now?

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:40.705
Why would you pee after you fart?

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.166
What kind of habit is that?

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.209
Do you know the work that
went into this suit?

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.254
Do you know how rare this fabric is?

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.595
You absolutely need military training.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.775
Why aren't you eating?

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.444
Is it that bad?

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.993
She'll be back, right?

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.227
Do you know how much I love this suit?

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:46.270
Hasn't anyone told you

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.524
not to pee on people's clothes?

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.985
This is the entrance to the monster world.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.577
Wuba!

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:02.829
Come here, Wuba!

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.340
I should've gone on a diet!

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:21.098
Wuba!

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:02.681
Wuba!

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:20.031
Catch him!

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.533
Give me your hand.

01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:26.204
It's not that easy!

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.470
Wuba's been taken.

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:42.804
We gotta get him!

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.934
Where did they go?
This is the monster world.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.103
Be careful!

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:51.437
Be careful of what?

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:52.689
I don't know either.

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.244
The big belly monsters
at the clinic!

01:26:06.245 --> 01:26:08.330
They were posed as pregnant women.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.790
They are all overweight!

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:12.751
They were the monster hunters
behind Brother Yun, too.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.003
It was a trap for us from the start.

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:23.345
Let's use the weapons from the workshop!

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:32.771
Hurry up!

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:40.779
Don't waste the Workshop
Master's hard work.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.656
Find something we can use.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:26.824
Watch out!

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:27.909
Don't let them see us.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.369
How can they not see us?

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:30.162
I'm just saying.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.121
Go, hurry!

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.881
Tianyin!

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.553
I can't breathe.
Me neither.

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.556
Loan! It stinks!

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.683
Hang in there. Wuba needs us.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.065
<i>Laugh.</i>

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:21.588
<i>Itch.</i>

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:37.771
Why are you laughing?

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:39.648
Did a laugh spell hit you?

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.442
Nope. I just find them hilarious.

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:49.533
He's leaving!

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:51.993
Go on. We'll cover you!

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:11.930
Don't be scared, Wuba!

01:29:11.931 --> 01:29:12.931
Mom and dad are here!

01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:15.684
I'm here, too.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.705
Hang on, Wuba! Or you're gone for good.

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:22.022
He'll be in pieces instead.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.732
What's the difference?
Actually no.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:25.192
Don't be scared, Wuba!

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.987
Mom's here!

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.702
I'm afraid of heights!

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:37.289
I'm afraid of ground!

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.917
Grab the whip, Wuba!

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:55.181
Hang on tight.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:29:59.769
I'm nimble.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:05.733
Oh my!

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:06.943
Is the sword valuable?

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.894
Good thing I have a big tummy.

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.480
Wuba!

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:46.149
Wuba!

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.197
You're unarmed, be careful!

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:03.208
<i>Magic word.</i> Mi-mi-Po-Ni-Kong-Kong!

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.850
Cover your nose.

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:23.644
They are getting stinkier.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.647
What's wrong with your stomach?

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:34.197
<i>Monster Language.</i> Go to hell!

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:35.240
How dare you took Wuba!

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:37.075
I'll crush you with my thousand taels!

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:43.163
I told you, my girlfriend is a strong lady!

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.623
And she can fly too!

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:46.542
How do you two kiss?

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.169
Just curious.

01:31:57.387 --> 01:31:58.762
Found this on the way.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:31:59.681
It's so shiny.

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:00.890
I thought it was gold!

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.183
Thank you, Mr. Tiger!

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.728
Why did you come for us?

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.066
Because I realized that...

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:12.485
I can't live without you.

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:14.362
Really?

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:15.780
Stupid!

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.615
When will you learn?

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:20.994
Stop chatting!

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.002
Take me up!

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:30.795
Hurry!

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.302
Fly to that monster!

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:21.929
You dummy.

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.598
Why didn't you tell me
about your secret weapon?

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.392
You never asked.
It's time to go!

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:45.703
It's getting bigger!

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:47.455
How can you leave us now?!

01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:50.834
I'm 90mg to call for help.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:53.753
Wuba!

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:54.712
Come back!

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:02.846
Wuba's going to attack!

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:12.354
That's not working.

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:13.606
Does he have something better?

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.071
Why are you doing this?

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.615
Because it's an order!

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:25.743
Run!

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:06.117
I just saw myself!

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:07.952
Did he spit on you, too?

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:11.706
I understand now.

01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:13.541
Anyone that Wuba spat on

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.085
will see what he sees
when he screams.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:17.837
Clever!

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.463
Now what?

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:20.965
How do we get out of this?!

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.359
Stay calm.

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.801
Let me think of something.

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:26.095
I sot it!

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:27.722
But we need to work together

01:35:27.723 --> 01:35:29.098
to make this plan work!

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:33.519
Wuba,

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:34.729
961 it?

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:56.960
<i>Magic word.</i> Mi-mi-Po-Ni-Kong-Kong!

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.175
Go!
BenBen!

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:07.804
Spit!

01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.405
Don't worry about me. Save Wuba!

01:36:36.332 --> 01:36:37.292
Wuba!

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.422
The sword can transform!

01:36:43.423 --> 01:36:44.424
The magic word is

01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:47.427
su... su...

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:49.762
Su-Lu-su-Lu-suo-Po-he!

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:24.797
Let go of me!

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:30.303
Wuba!

01:37:30.304 --> 01:37:31.512
You're up!

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:38.186
Tianyin,

01:37:38.187 --> 01:37:40.063
Wuba's eyes are closed.
I can't see a thing.

01:37:40.438 --> 01:37:41.314
I got you.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.254
Wuba!

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:46.671
Give me!

01:38:46.672 --> 01:38:48.089
We were so worried.

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:14.448
I hope that humans and monsters

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:16.075
can co-exist someday.

01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:18.161
And that monsters
won't need to wear human skins.

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:19.786
That would be wonderful.

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:20.912
Then I can walk around naked!

01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:22.707
You're already naked every day!

01:39:27.253 --> 01:39:28.503
You should feel sorry

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:29.797
for leaving us like that!

01:39:30.089 --> 01:39:31.631
I'm all about loyalty.

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:33.384
I don't leave my brothers behind.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:34.469
Now.

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:36.554
Here's my girlfriend's cousin.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.558
She's even bigger than Cui.

01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:43.186
I have a bad feeling about this.

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:46.230
Hey.

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:48.816
Hey.

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:50.860
Ask your girlfriend's cousin

01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:52.820
to take Wuba's family back.

01:39:52.945 --> 01:39:54.155
I'll pay you double.

01:39:54.489 --> 01:39:56.407
No problem. I'll do it for free!

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.537
Brother Tu, we have
to thank you for...

01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:03.080
No need to thank me.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.790
Thank you, Brother Tu!

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:06.292
Okay, enough.

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:08.586
That's enough out of you, too.

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.171
Wuba just said, you
should stop gambling.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:12.381
Enough already!

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:16.802
That's really enough, guys.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.141
Wuba.

01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:25.144
I'll miss you!

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.066
Do take care.

01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:33.194
Eat more

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:37.156
and be good!

01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:44.497
Stop crying, BenBen.

01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:46.207
Let's go!

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:03.266
All this time I've known you,

01:41:03.516 --> 01:41:05.560
this is the first time I've seen you cry.

01:41:06.102 --> 01:41:06.852
Shut up.

01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:21.909
I wonder, why hasn't
Wuba spat at me yet?

01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:24.537
Simply because he doesn't like you!

01:41:29.208 --> 01:41:30.292
Did you see that?!

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:30.960
Spit at him!

01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:33.169
Enough! Don't, stop!

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:33.713
Stop!

01:41:33.713 --> 01:41:34.505
No!

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:35.047
Not "don't stop."

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:35.631
I mean "Don't!" "Stop!".

01:41:35.632 --> 01:41:36.841
Stop!

01:41:43.514 --> 01:41:46.224
Now I understand
why Spiky's family can be happy

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:47.727
even when they're in jail.

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:51.646
It doesn't matter
if we're in the monster or human world.

01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:54.442
What matters most is that
we stay together as a family.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:05.494
I kind of miss Little Zhu.

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.622
She's really not that bad.

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.957
Are you thinking about that big cousin?

01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:11.125
No way!

01:42:11.126 --> 01:42:13.210
That's absurd.

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:15.712
I saw the way you looked at her.

01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:17.173
You can't deny.

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:19.008
Was I that obvious?

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:21.635
But she does have a nice figure.

01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:23.262
I didn't know that's what you're into.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:25.764
How about you lend me some money?

01:42:25.765 --> 01:42:27.492
I want to take her out to dinner.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:29.934
She seems to have a big appetite.

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:31.520
It will cost you a lot, BenBen.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:33.855
Please don't call me
BenBen in front of her?

01:42:33.856 --> 01:42:35.273
It sounds kind of weak.

01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:36.609
You are strong and fast.

01:42:37.193 --> 01:42:38.860
I've been calling you BangBang.

01:42:38.861 --> 01:42:42.073
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:44.283
You never asked.

01:43:19.902 --> 01:43:21.820
I knew that this would happen!

01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:23.155
My bad.

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:31.580
You...

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:39.880
You little naked brat!

01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:55.520
How do you two kiss?

01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:57.231
Just curious.

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:26.903
That's perfect.

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:28.155
Get away from me.

01:44:28.179 --> 01:44:29.847
Good take!

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.100
I'm swollen.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:35.019
Do you still need another take?

01:44:36.896 --> 01:44:37.855
Switch legs.

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:44.836
