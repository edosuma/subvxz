ALL:
Beat Mandeville!

01:33.026 --> 01:35.518
- Yeah!
-(cheering and applause)

01:35.629 --> 01:38.792
(all squealing, laughing)

01:38.899 --> 01:41.061
0y! I could have been
a cheerleader.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.599
- Hi, Al.
- Oh, hi, Rich.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.035
Hey, you going
to the pep rally'?

01:45.138 --> 01:47.107
Oh, no, no,
that's high school stuff.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.766
No, I just brought
the car around

01:48.875 --> 01:49.968
to pick up the instruments.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.840
We have to play
at the, uh, Leopard Lodge

01:51.945 --> 01:54.539
Annual Poo-Pah Doo-Dah Dance.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.673
You going to be going, Al?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.150
No, I'm not allowed to.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.721
- I don't have enough spots yet.
- RICHIE: Oh.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.756
But someday, I'll be a Poo-Pah.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.518
Or I'll be a Doo-Dah.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.719
I could even be
a Poo-Pah Doo-Dah.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.264
I know it's a dream.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.233
(cheering): Come on,
see the basket, see the ball.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.702
Come on, stupid, hit the wall!

02:17.804 --> 02:20.069
Yeah!

02:20.173 --> 02:21.436
They're all outside.

02:21.541 --> 02:25.000
Oh. Well, they can't
start without me. Oh.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.545
Hi, Chachi!

02:26.646 --> 02:29.047
Wah, wah, wah.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.275
What is he wearing?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.749
CROWD (chanting):
Let's go, team!

02:31.852 --> 02:33.342
Let's go, team!
Let's go, team...!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.114
- RICHIE: Hi, Chachi.
- Hi, Rich. Hey, Al.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.985
CROWD: Let's go, team!
Let's go, team...

02:37.090 --> 02:38.183
I came to load the drums.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.350
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

02:39.459 --> 02:40.654
Wait a minute.
Let me see this.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.989
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

02:42.095 --> 02:43.392
Lords? What are you, crazy?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.964
-(chanting continues)
- No, I'm the drummer, remember?

02:45.065 --> 02:47.466
Is that a gang jacket?

02:47.567 --> 02:48.796
Yeah, Al. I joined the Lords.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.393
It's the best gang in town.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.028
And did I luck out.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.970
My first day in the gang,
we got a rumble.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.166
Isn't it cool?

02:55.275 --> 02:56.766
Wait'll the chicks hear that.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.071
(laughs)

02:58.178 --> 02:59.771
Chicks? Rumble?

02:59.880 --> 03:00.938
Cool?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.174
CROWD:
Let's go, team...!

03:02.282 --> 03:03.750
Those gangs are tough!

03:03.850 --> 03:06.115
I mean, those-those...
they got bad reputations!

03:06.219 --> 03:07.983
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

03:08.088 --> 03:10.819
That's not
my Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.892
What's the matter, Al?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.290
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

03:14.394 --> 03:16.192
I could make this
the Lords' new hang-out.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.661
- What do you say?
-(chanting continues)

03:17.764 --> 03:19.664
I don't want
that kind of business!

03:19.766 --> 03:21.666
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

03:21.768 --> 03:24.067
Beat Mandeville! Beat
Mandeville! Beat Mandeville!

03:24.171 --> 03:25.502
What's he got against gangs?

03:25.605 --> 03:28.234
I'll tell you what he's got
against gangs, Clyde.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.502
Sit down.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.077
I don't have to sit. I'm a Lord.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.112
I said, sit down!

03:33.213 --> 03:35.204
Guess Lords sit.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.079
You got scrambled eggs
for brains? Joining a gang.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.348
There's nothing wrong
with being in a gang. It's cool.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.980
And besides,
the Lords don't call me Clyde.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.581
And they don't treat me
like a kid.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.217
Yeah, and neither
will the police...

03:47.327 --> 03:49.125
when they haul you in
for-for rumbling,

03:49.229 --> 03:50.628
or stealing, or even worse.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.131
Oh, yeah? Well, Fonzie was in a
gang, and he's doing all right.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.564
He was the leader
of the Falcons.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.965
Oh, he quit.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.594
See, Fonzie was smart.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.196
Quit? The Fonz?!

04:00.307 --> 04:02.298
- That's right.
- CHACHl: You're kidding.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.639
I thought
they just retired his jacket.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.839
No.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.850
Well, I guess Fonzie doesn't
talk too much about those days.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.046
All right, all right, I'm going
to tell you about 'em.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.750
First time I ever met Fonzie,
he was still in the Falcons.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.384
It was about, uh,
three and a half years ago.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.759
Matter of fact,
I think it was the first day

04:23.864 --> 04:26.230
of my sophomore year
at Jefferson High School.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.200
(jukebox plays upbeat
rock 'n' roll)

04:29.302 --> 04:31.771

05:04.671 --> 05:06.639
Would you believe this?
This is Arnold's!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.037
Yeah.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.939
I've been waiting
all my life to come here.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.704
I can't...
Well, this is Arnold's!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.143
We're sophomores now, Rich.
We're entitled.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.373
Yeah.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.246
Man, oh, man, we got it made
in the shade. Hey.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.148
(girls giggling)

05:23.089 --> 05:24.887
Okay, sports, what'll it be?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.118
The usual.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.194
Potsie,
this is our first time here.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.594
Uh, well,
what would you suggest?

05:31.698 --> 05:34.725
Ordering...
before I lose my patience.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.769
Oh, oh, we'll have, uh,
two cherry colas

05:36.870 --> 05:38.633
and, uh, an order of fries.

05:38.738 --> 05:39.967
And separate checks.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.973
Sophomores.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.305
Cute.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.846
I knew she'd be impressed.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.285
Who's the kid
with the gum on his face?

05:59.392 --> 06:02.089
He's a new kid in my home room,
just moved in from across town.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.754
He's a funny guy.
You're gonna love him.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.990
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Hey.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.567
How are you?
How are you? How are you?

06:07.667 --> 06:09.328
Yeah.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.801
Arthur Godfrey, right?

06:10.904 --> 06:13.635
Yeah, the old redhead.
Pretty good, huh?

06:13.740 --> 06:16.835
Oh, uh, Richie Cunningham,
this here is Malph Ralph.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.570
You got it backwards.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.942
It's Ralph... Malph, see?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.640
I got it. So does my T-shirt.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.046
-(Ralph laughs)
- Oh.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.176
Well, either way, it's, uh,
very nice meeting you.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.754
Yeah, everyone says that.
(laughs)

06:27.854 --> 06:29.322
Say, did you two guys
hear the one

06:29.422 --> 06:31.152
about the fat lady
who walked into the drugstore

06:31.258 --> 06:32.691
and asked for the talcum powder?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.522
So, the druggist says,
"Sure, walk this way."

06:34.628 --> 06:36.459
The lady says,
"if I could walk that way,

06:36.563 --> 06:37.587
I wouldn't need the powder."

06:37.697 --> 06:39.222
(Ralph guffaws)

06:39.332 --> 06:40.891
That's great. That's great.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.264
You got any more?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.701
Do birds have beaks?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.839
We got company. A biker.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.474
Worse than a biker.
It's a Falcon.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.574
I know. I know.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.546
(Richie, Potsie and Ralph
humming and whistling)

07:04.658 --> 07:06.956
(Richie clears his throat)

07:07.060 --> 07:08.459
Hi.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.188
Something I could do for you?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.332
Oh, well, I... I guess not.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.743
Been nice talking to you.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.151
Now you've done it. We're dead.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.243
Yeah, you rang, Fonzie?

07:35.789 --> 07:39.156
Oh, yeah, Fonz, there's three
nerds sitting in your booth.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.751
What do you want me
to do to 'em, huh?

07:41.861 --> 07:43.625
Some, uh,
free dental work maybe?

07:43.730 --> 07:46.165
(man laughs, Ralph cries)

07:46.266 --> 07:47.460
I just got my braces off.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.433
I haven't had a Tootsie Roll
in three years.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.698
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
now, you guys...

07:51.805 --> 07:54.831
You guys wouldn't hit a man
in glasses now, would you?

07:57.210 --> 07:59.907
You and your pals
are in big trouble.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.503
Pals? What pals?

08:01.614 --> 08:03.310
I don't know these guys.
I'm new here.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.850
As a matter of fact,
I just met 'em.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.112
See you at school, strangers.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.812
I gotta go, too.

08:07.921 --> 08:08.854
Cancel our order!

08:08.955 --> 08:11.083
Wait, Pots, wait a minute.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.091
Wait. Why-Why can't we just
sit here?

08:13.193 --> 08:14.888
- Because.
- Why?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.462
Because!

08:16.563 --> 08:18.759
Why? Why, Fonz?
Why can't they sit here?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.835
Falcon turf.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.198
Turf?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.772
No, no, this isn't turf,
this is a booth.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.739
I don't see your name on it.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.800
Hmm?

08:33.380 --> 08:36.144
"This is Falcon turf."

08:36.249 --> 08:39.150
Oh... hmm...

08:39.251 --> 08:42.051
I carved that myself.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.123
With that nail.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.693
Yeah, you got it real deep, too.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.594
-(Richie clears his throat)
- Yeah, real deep. Oh.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.258
Look, uh, let me, explain this
to you, kid.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.392
You see, we gotta
defend our turf,

08:56.503 --> 08:57.800
because, if we don't,

08:57.904 --> 09:00.305
then we ain't got no turf
to defend.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.773
You see how simple it is?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.241
I tell you,

09:04.344 --> 09:06.676
this whole situation
is just full of malarkey.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.874
Okay, enough gabbing.
Let's fight.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.041
- Fight?!
- RICHIE: No, no!

09:11.151 --> 09:13.244
No way I'm gonna
fight over a booth.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.344
Well, you're gonna have to,
dope.

09:15.455 --> 09:18.220
'Cause you're gonna get creamed,
anyways.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.953
Who's your warlord?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.995
What's a warlord?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.690
Warlord--
he, uh, makes arrangements.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.630
He don't fight.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.669
I'll be his warlord.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.433
Tonight, in the alley, midnight.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.805
That okay with you, Rich?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.310
No.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.312
Potsie, you... you know
I can't stay out

09:41.414 --> 09:44.042
after 9:00 on weeknights.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.379
(laughing)

09:45.485 --> 09:48.352
Hey, you crack the Fonz up.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.150
Yeah, I-I-I can see that.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.021
Uh, he's hysterical.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.323
Doesn't your mommy
and your daddy let you stay out

09:56.429 --> 09:58.420
on Saturday night?

09:59.732 --> 10:01.633
Well, yeah, sure,
Saturday, sure.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.101
The alley, Saturday night,
10:00.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.831
Without weapons.
I don't need 'em.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.133
Be there.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.139
Alone.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.767
And you B-Y-0-B.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.811
B-Y-O-B?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.380
Yeah. Bring your own Band-Aids.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.505
Get out of here.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.480
POTSIE:
Boy, Rich,

10:21.588 --> 10:23.385
wasn't coming
to Arnold's worth waiting for?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.015
Imagine, first time here,
and I'm a warlord.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.924
Aw, sit on it, Potsie!

10:35.602 --> 10:37.729
HOWARD: Well, Marion,
we're finally going to get rid

10:37.837 --> 10:39.532
of the snow
on this television set.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.232
Hi, Mom, Dad.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.706
HOWARD:
Richard.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.574
Oh, Richard,
you still have those pants on.

10:45.678 --> 10:46.839
Yeah, I guess so.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.505
How could you?

10:48.615 --> 10:50.481
You wore those same pants
yesterday.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.812
Well, Mom, they're not dirty,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.943
and besides,
I got to get 'em broken in.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.181
- They look too new.
- Oh.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.418
Do I have to start
laying your clothes out again?

10:59.526 --> 11:00.720
Oh...!

11:00.827 --> 11:01.885
Dad!

11:01.995 --> 11:03.155
Marion!

11:03.263 --> 11:05.163
Howard!

11:05.265 --> 11:07.961
Sorry, Rich,
I did the best I could.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.403
Oh, I just hate it
when they grow up.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.032
It's Saturday night.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.610
Haven't you got a date?

11:17.710 --> 11:20.305
Oh, well, uh, I-l was supposed
to meet this-this guy,

11:20.413 --> 11:23.110
but, uh, no, I don't... I don't
think I'm-I'm gonna go.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.912
Oh, well, good, then, you can
give me a hand with this.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.543
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't want to miss Gleason.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.848
Sure, Dad.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.753
<i>.53“?
“mm?</i>

11:30.857 --> 11:34.088
You know, a really strange thing
happened to...

11:34.194 --> 11:35.855
uh, at the cafeteria
the other day?

11:35.962 --> 11:37.122
Yeah?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.720
Hand me that tall one, will you?

11:38.831 --> 11:40.129
Oh, sure.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.928
See, this, uh...

11:42.035 --> 11:44.196
this-this guy was just sitting
at this table.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.397
- Mm-hmm. -Actually,
he's a very, very nice guy.

11:46.506 --> 11:50.465
And, uh, all of a sudden,
this hood comes up to him, see?

11:50.577 --> 11:53.341
And the hood comes up
to the guy and says,

11:53.446 --> 11:56.382
"Can't sit there.
It's my turf."

11:58.318 --> 11:59.910
See, and sin...
then the nice guy--

12:00.019 --> 12:01.919
who really is
a very, very good guy--

12:02.021 --> 12:04.752
he says "Oh, well,
it's not turf.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.416
Why can't I just sit here?"

12:06.526 --> 12:08.119
So-so then the hood

12:08.227 --> 12:10.526
wanted to fight the nice guy
over the table.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.189
Oh, that's not right.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.595
Listen, hand me another tube,

12:13.700 --> 12:14.894
-will you?
- Yeah.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.366
Well, I'll tell you something,
Richard.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.497
If, uh, eating at that table
was important to the nice guy,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.905
and he really cared
about what other people thought,

12:23.009 --> 12:24.272
well, then, I guess maybe

12:24.377 --> 12:26.243
he fought for something
he believed in.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.246
Yeah.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.010
Yeah, you're right, Dad.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.085
And I'm going to fight him!

12:33.186 --> 12:34.585
- Thanks.
- HOWARD: It's all right.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.950
What?!

12:45.064 --> 12:47.465
(dog barking in distance)

12:57.944 --> 12:59.275
-(cat screeches)
-(Richie gasps)

12:59.379 --> 13:01.370
(clattering)

13:05.385 --> 13:08.081
All right, I heard you!

13:08.187 --> 13:10.952
You're out there somewhere!

13:11.057 --> 13:12.616
Just come on out.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.386
Show yourself, like a man.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.059
-(cat screeches)
-(Richie shouts)

13:29.342 --> 13:30.832
- POTSIE: Rich?
- Potsie?

13:30.943 --> 13:34.345
Yeah. It's me and Malph Ralph.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.937
RALPH:
It's Ralph Malph.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.676
Just read the T-shirt.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.345
POTSIE: Look, when he gets here,
send him this way.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.218
RALPH:
We'll clobber him!

13:43.322 --> 13:44.813
What?

13:44.924 --> 13:47.518
Hey, come on out here, guys,
will you? Hurry up.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.288
- Rich...
- Yeah?

13:50.396 --> 13:51.796
Rich, you gotta go along
with this.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.593
It's the only way
you stand a chance.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.463
Ambush one guy?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.059
Three against one?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.331
Oh, I think that's worse
than the Falcons.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.202
Let's do it anyway.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.277
No, Potsie, Richie's right.
We can't do that.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.607
I'm sorry, Rich. It was my idea.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.613
You see, I was really ashamed
about the way I acted

14:08.715 --> 14:10.114
at Arnold's, you know? So...

14:10.216 --> 14:12.275
Well, Potsie and I had this talk
in homeroom.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.411
We decided we'd come here and
help you from getting creamed.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.682
Yeah.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.348
Oh.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.689
Guys, showing up,
that was really keen.

14:21.794 --> 14:25.356
Oh, well, Pots,
what can I say about you?

14:25.465 --> 14:28.298
- A lot.
-(chuckles)

14:28.401 --> 14:30.096
And, Ralph...

14:30.203 --> 14:34.037
you know, you're a real regular
guy for a... for a new kid.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.972
- Thanks, Rich.
- Yeah.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.840
But, look, guys,
I took this fight.

14:38.945 --> 14:42.438
And I-l just got to handle it
without any... ambushes.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.575
- Well, it always worked
for Randolph Scott. -Mmm.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.585
Look, Rich, are you sure
you don't want us to stay?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.246
- I'm positive.
- RALPH and POTSIE: Good!

14:49.355 --> 14:51.346
- See you later.
- Good luck.

14:53.059 --> 14:58.054
I wonder if Randolph Scott
ever cried.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.859
(sighs)

15:06.405 --> 15:08.965
10:00.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.908
I guess he's not showing up.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.809
(nervous chuckle)

15:14.947 --> 15:16.347
Heyyy.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.376
But I could be wrong.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.592
Hi.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.094
You showed.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.756
Sure, I showed. Why shouldn't
I show? I'm prompt.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.067
Very impressive.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.107
Three of my fights tonight
didn't show up.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.505
Well, that would be rude.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.741
The night wasn't a total loss.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.282
Red Devils and me had a rumble.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.045
Well, you just took
on a whole gang. Why?

15:53.152 --> 15:56.054
Because one of the Red Devils

15:56.155 --> 15:59.318
bumped into Monk on a bus.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.326
Oh, he bumped into him. Oh.

16:02.428 --> 16:04.920
What's the matter? Couldn't you
find a firing squad?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.798
We fight for a lot
of good reasons.

16:08.901 --> 16:09.959
Yeah? Like what?

16:10.069 --> 16:12.163
All right, I had
to take care of some guy

16:12.271 --> 16:14.171
because he looked
at Lefty's girl.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.674
Oh, looked at his girl.
Oh, yeah, that's a beaut.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.175
All right,
I had to take care of some guy,

16:18.277 --> 16:19.335
Big Murph, as a matter of fact,

16:19.445 --> 16:21.470
because he was down
reading our magazines

16:21.581 --> 16:23.742
at the Falcon candy store.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.579
All right, all right,
let me just get this straight.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.176
Uh, you fight for,
uh, bumping...

16:28.287 --> 16:30.187
-for looking...
- That's right.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.313
And for reading.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.391
That's right.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.050
Those are, uh...

16:34.160 --> 16:36.151
interesting reasons.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.223
They're reasons.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.164
Let's get this over with.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.168
- You ever street fight before?
- Yeah, yeah...

16:44.270 --> 16:46.170
- Tell me when.
- I've mixed it up a few times.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.899
- When?
- In the third grade once...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.499
Oh, yeah? That's what I thought.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.771
(strained):
Well, I can't remember 'em all.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.511
All right.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.677
All right, look, we came here
to fight, so let's do it.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.982
Let's just get it over with.
Will you do something?

17:03.990 --> 17:06.083
Well, what's the matter, kid?

17:06.192 --> 17:07.625
If someone punched me
in the stomach like that,

17:07.727 --> 17:09.126
I'd make him part of the wall.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.127
Okay.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.925
Okay, you asked for it.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.431
You think you're real tough,
don't you,

17:14.532 --> 17:16.694
just 'cause you got that Falcon
jacket on, don't you?

17:33.486 --> 17:35.113
Well, that answers
that question.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.848
Let's just stop dillydallying,
all right?

17:39.959 --> 17:42.951
All right, you asked for it.
You just bought it, buddy.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.900
What are you, crazy?
Bring a gun?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.559
Yeah.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.694
(imitates gunshot)

17:55.641 --> 17:57.075
So what do you want to do?

17:57.176 --> 17:59.941
You want to play
Cowboys and Indians now, huh?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.274
This time it was pretend.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.349
Next time you won't be so lucky.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.543
What happens if you run
into some dark alley?

18:05.651 --> 18:07.210
Some maniac with a real gun?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.345
Instead of a-a prompt kid
with a quick finger?

18:09.455 --> 18:11.082
Let me tell you something...

18:11.190 --> 18:13.750
Let me tell you something, punk.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.623
I knew you were kidding.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.457
I was kidding this time.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.123
What happens when somebody
finds you dead in a gutter?

18:20.232 --> 18:21.791
Because somebody bumped Monk

18:21.901 --> 18:23.801
or somebody read
a Falcon comic book?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.803
Why are you even in a gang?
It's crazy.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.270
Because I'm cool, that's why.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.932
Because there's cool in numbers,
that's why.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.135
You're cool-- I agree with that.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.610
All those other guys are cool
because of you.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.237
Did you ever think
that they're using you?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.283
Just stay off my back, all
right? Just stay off my back.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.556
You-you just...

18:45.658 --> 18:47.490
The...

18:47.593 --> 18:50.085
the whole building with the...
You just...

18:50.196 --> 18:52.028
H-How did you do that?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.929
It's a gift.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.127
Hey, you know something?
You know something?

18:57.236 --> 18:59.898
Yeah, I know something.
I did it without my jacket.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.805
Let's go.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.883
All right. But I'm warning you,

19:10.983 --> 19:13.884
I'm scrappy-

19:13.986 --> 19:16.478
Okay, scrappy-

19:16.589 --> 19:18.216
You know something, kid?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.416
You know something?

19:19.525 --> 19:21.493
You got a lot of guts.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.653
I like that.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.926
W-Was that just a-a punch?

19:27.033 --> 19:30.002
Or, uh...

19:30.102 --> 19:32.071
were you being friendly?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.230
You're still standing,
aren't you?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.534
You were being friendly.

19:35.641 --> 19:36.938
Heyyy.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.476
I'll give you a ride home.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.273
Thanks.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.904
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute, uh...

19:42.014 --> 19:44.142
you're forgetting something.
You...

19:44.250 --> 19:46.082
Don't forget your jacket
and your cap.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.414
Hey, what are you, crazy?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.386
You think
I need those to be cool?

19:49.488 --> 19:52.481
I think I'm gonna leave
the Falcons.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.955
Oh, so, uh...

19:59.065 --> 20:01.363
I guess what I said
kind of sunk in, huh?

20:01.467 --> 20:03.026
- Let me tell you something.
- Hmm...?

20:03.135 --> 20:05.695
I make my own decisions,
you understand?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.170
- Yeah. -I been thinking
about this a long time.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.638
I've been waiting
for the right time.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.641
You think I've got to hang
around with a bunch of nerds,

20:10.743 --> 20:13.974
bumping people, having rumbles
over stepping on somebody?

20:14.080 --> 20:17.243
Huh? You think I want to end up
in a dark alley

20:17.349 --> 20:20.376
with some prompt maniac
sticking a knife in my ribs?

20:20.486 --> 20:22.921
Whoa.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.855
Well, no, no, that's, uh...
that's good reasoning.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.052
I know that.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.789
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.626
Hold it, hold it.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.632
I never got your name.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.964
Oh, it's, uh, Cunningham.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.594
- Hmm.
- Richard Cunningham.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.674
That's cute.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.469
You can call me the Fonz.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.203
All right, uh... great.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.642
You can call me Richie.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.806
Whoa.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.175
Get out of here. Come here.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.434
So Fonzie quit the Falcons.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.973
For good.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.976
You see, he realized he didn't
have to be in a gang to be cool.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.911
Yeah, but you mean...

21:22.014 --> 21:23.175
That was the fight?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.307
Yep. That was it.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.182
Cute story, Cunningham,
but I got to run.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.278
A couple of the Lords are gonna
meet me down here.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.720
They're gonna drive me
to the rumble.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.314
What neat guys.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.894
(scoffs)

21:35.995 --> 21:37.622
I'll go load the drums.

21:37.730 --> 21:41.063
Yeah, well, thanks for listening
to my cute story.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.800
(sighs heavily)

21:49.909 --> 21:52.810
Yeah, I agree with you, Al.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.143
(both sigh heavily)

21:56.248 --> 21:58.911
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.712
Wh-Where is he? Where is he?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.585
Do you know what that
knucklehead is doing? Huh?

22:04.690 --> 22:05.919
Where's Chachi?
He wants to join the Lords

22:06.025 --> 22:06.855
or something like that.

22:06.959 --> 22:07.983
There he is.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.493
- No, wait, Fonz. Wait a minute.
- What?

22:09.595 --> 22:11.825
Look, uh, don't hit him
or anything.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.831
I already had a long talk
with him.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.628
At this moment in my life,
I think that belting

22:15.734 --> 22:16.702
is better than talking.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.702
Well, maybe neither one is best.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.034
I think he's got to make up
his own mind on this.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.041
Hey, he can make up
his own mind.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.409
If he makes it wrong, I'm gonna
tie his eyebrows together.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.073
Hey, Chach, where are you?
Hey, there.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.014
Come on over here, look,
I got the weapons for you.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.949
Look at that. Hey, look at that.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.022
Your very own rumble chain,
what do you think of that?

22:37.122 --> 22:39.114
I oiled it for you, too, huh?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.886
You fight with chains?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.688
IGGY: Yeah, we got to teach
them Hornets, man,

22:42.795 --> 22:45.560
that they can't get away with
stepping on the Masher's foot.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.030
Right?

22:47.132 --> 22:49.362
You're rumbling over a foot?

22:49.468 --> 22:53.098
Yeah, we're gonna fight
for a lot of good reasons, man.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.105
Yeah, I heard.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.107
So just forget it.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.109
I don't want to be in your gang.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.145
(quietly):
What...?

23:03.749 --> 23:05.376
What?!

23:05.484 --> 23:06.975
Hey, kid, come over here.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.452
Nobody quits the Lords.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.784
Uh-uh.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.653
Not unless they want to go out
on a stretcher.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.055
So come on!

23:14.159 --> 23:16.594
You're gonna fight me?

23:16.695 --> 23:18.925
Kid...

23:19.031 --> 23:22.558
you got a lot of guts.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.839
Hey, kid, I'm gonna take you
and twist you around

23:28.941 --> 23:32.172
until I turn you inside out.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.769
- Oh, yeah? (chuckles)
- Yeah.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.348
Help?

23:37.383 --> 23:40.546
Okay, bucko,
you just put him down.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.280
You gonna mess with him,
you better be ready

23:42.388 --> 23:44.288
-to mess with me, too.
- Oh, wow.

23:44.390 --> 23:48.190
- That goes for me, too.
-(Iggy chuckles)

23:52.531 --> 23:53.692
Uh, well, look...

23:53.799 --> 23:56.860
Hey, uh... look, kid,

23:56.969 --> 23:58.869
nobody gotta
get hurt here, right?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.404
We don't mean to be here, right?

24:00.506 --> 24:02.633
Come on, let's get out of here.

24:02.741 --> 24:04.903
- And don't come back!
-(Richie chuckles)

24:05.010 --> 24:07.001
Chickens!

24:20.459 --> 24:21.517
You did the right thing, Chachi.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.526
CROWD (chanting):
Beat Mandeville!

24:22.628 --> 24:24.357
You're a good boy.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.453
Yeah, you did great.

24:25.564 --> 24:26.690
CROWD: Beat Mandeville!
Beat Mandeville!

24:26.799 --> 24:30.462
Fonz, uh, did you see that?
(chuckles)

24:30.569 --> 24:33.095
You guys were tigers.

24:34.573 --> 24:35.699
Let's go to a pep rally.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.968
- CROWD: Let's go, team...!
- Pep rally?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.304
Wait a minute.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.504
Telling me you're interested
in basketball?

24:40.612 --> 24:42.547
Who's talking baskets and balls?

24:42.648 --> 24:44.241
I'm talking cheerleaders.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.647
- Oh.
- Heyyy.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.810
Hey, wait for me!

24:47.920 --> 24:51.447
Cheerleaders-- wah, wah, wah.
(chuckles)

24:51.557 --> 24:52.683
FONZIE and RICHIE:
