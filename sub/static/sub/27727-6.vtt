(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:53.960 --> 00:55.880
(CHEERING)

00:59.160 --> 01:02.520
Hello, everybody. Hel-lo!

01:02.560 --> 01:04.520
(WHISTLING)

01:04.560 --> 01:07.520
-Hello!
-Thank you.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.560
-Thank you, everybody.
-Hello!

01:09.560 --> 01:11.280
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.920
RICHARD:
Hello!

01:13.000 --> 01:16.040
Thank you so much, everybody.
Thank you. Now...

01:16.080 --> 01:19.520
Coming up
in this week's show:

01:19.560 --> 01:22.040
A supercar
is dismantled for no reason.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.120
A man with no shirt on.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.600
And my whole tongue
is wrapped up in intestine.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.960
My whole tongue
is wrapped up in intestine.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.480
Those are the highlights.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.960
-Those are the best bits.
-Yep.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.280
They really are.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.920
Anyway...
over here in the West,

01:42.960 --> 01:46.920
we tend to think
that at £360,000

01:46.960 --> 01:50.080
a Rolls Royce Phantom
is quite expensive.

01:50.120 --> 01:54.760
But this week, The Grand Tour
is focusing mostly on China.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.920
And over there,
things are a bit different.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.520
(INSECT BUZZING)

02:06.560 --> 02:11.720
JEREMY: Not that long ago,
China was full of old,
bent-over rice-farmer ladies,

02:11.760 --> 02:14.120
up to their ankles in mud.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.120
But these days,
things have changed a bit.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.280
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

02:39.840 --> 02:43.080
As recently as the 1980s,

02:43.120 --> 02:45.720
people here
would lie awake at night

02:45.760 --> 02:47.760
dreaming of
having enough money...

02:48.840 --> 02:50.760
...to buy a mule.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.680
Whereas now,
just 30 years later,

02:56.720 --> 03:00.000
they dream of being able
to buy a Hongqi.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.440
Specifically this Hongqi -
the L5.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.520
In Chinese,
Hongqi means "the red flag",

03:10.560 --> 03:13.560
the symbol
of communism.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.520
But there's nothing
at all communistical

03:16.560 --> 03:18.560
about this monster's
price tag.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.720
Which is £880,000.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.360
The interior is
an exquisite work of art

03:29.400 --> 03:33.080
with rosewood panelling
and cream leather.

03:33.120 --> 03:37.560
The dashboard and centre
console are fully digital.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.600
There's jade in
the door handles

03:39.640 --> 03:42.720
and golden sunflowers
everywhere else.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.560
I only saw this thing for the
first time a few moments ago

03:47.600 --> 03:49.880
and already I'm in love.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.720
I love the way each door
weighs the same as
a medium-sized mountain.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.600
I love the red flags here
and on the bonnet.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.080
I love the flagpoles.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.760
It's like... it's like
a cartoon baddie's car,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.640
cos in real life
nobody could be that bad.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.760
I mean, it's impossible!

04:12.080 --> 04:15.440
One thing the Hongqi doesn't
have is armour plating,

04:15.480 --> 04:17.000
but even so,

04:17.040 --> 04:22.200
it weighs
just shy of 3.2 tons.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.440
Now to move this
enormous weight around,

04:27.480 --> 04:31.200
it's fitted with
a six-litre V12 engine

04:31.240 --> 04:34.200
which turns petrol
into silence.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.920
It's not particularly
comfortable, though.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.440
The seats especially
are very hard.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.360
And the steering wheel
adjuster button is broken

04:43.440 --> 04:44.920
and there are no cup holders.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.760
And it certainly isn't fast.

04:47.800 --> 04:53.240
In fact, it has the same
power-to-weight ratio
as a Peugeot 308 diesel.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.800
Hongqi won't say
what the 0 to 60 time is.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.800
I suspect because
it won't actually do 60.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.200
You know what, though?
I don't care
about any of that,

05:05.240 --> 05:08.360
because it is just
magnificent and evil.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.880
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

05:09.920 --> 05:13.000
Gloriously, brilliantly evil.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.240
Despite its villainous
presence, though,

05:17.240 --> 05:19.360
the price is mad.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.360
So, I called May and Hammond

05:22.360 --> 05:24.720
and we came up with an idea.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.440
If you are a Chinese
businessman or
businessman-woman,

05:38.480 --> 05:40.600
and you want a car
that reflects your status,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.280
you don't need
to spend £880,000.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.480
You can simply
pop over to Europe

05:45.520 --> 05:47.960
and buy a Mercedes S-Class,
like this one.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.800
And even though
this is the 6-litre V12,

05:55.840 --> 05:59.200
it cost me just £8,800.

05:59.240 --> 06:05.280
In other words, you could
have 100 of these
for the price of a Hongqi.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.560
At this point, my colleague
Richard Hammond arrived in...

06:08.600 --> 06:10.040
something or other.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.400
What is that?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.640
This is a Cadillac STS
and you can shut up.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.200
-I wasn't gonna say anything.
-Good.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.840
Because this is fitted
with one of the
best engines of all time.

06:20.880 --> 06:25.320
The creamy smooth,
4.6-litre Northstar V8.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.360
Making 300
all-American horsepower.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.320
That engine was designed
so it can run
for up to 100 miles

06:31.360 --> 06:32.800
with no coolant in it at all,

06:32.840 --> 06:36.040
by shutting down one bank
of the V8 until it cools

06:36.080 --> 06:38.520
and then the other one,
and then the other one.
That is clever.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.280
-And front-wheel drive?
-Yeah?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.720
It's a luxury car.
Who cares what wheels
are being driven, James?

06:44.760 --> 06:49.480
Well, people who care
about torque steer,
weight distribution,

06:49.520 --> 06:51.200
-dignified engineering,
doing things properly.
-All right.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.520
I'll cancel all the track
days I've entered in it

06:53.560 --> 06:56.080
and I'll just drive around
in it as a luxury car.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.360
Anyway, this is the Mercedes
S-Class, which, as we know,

06:59.400 --> 07:01.760
is really a sort of paradigm
for the luxury car

07:01.800 --> 07:04.120
and it's a pioneer of many
things that are new on cars

07:04.160 --> 07:06.280
and that we come to see
as standard some years later.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.480
For example...

07:08.520 --> 07:11.320
-first car to have...
-Soft-close doors.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.560
How many miles has it done?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.840
180...000.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.880
RICHARD:
Yeah, well, I figured.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.840
-Where did your car
come from?
-Germany.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.520
-A German...
-Mm-hm.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.320
...bought a Cadillac?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.160
We were then interrupted

07:24.200 --> 07:28.560
by the arrival of Clarkson
in a BMW.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.560
Ooh, I see you've
bought the long car.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.280
-Yours is long as well.
-Are you two beamed
from the 1970s?

07:36.320 --> 07:39.080
-No, they're long-wheel base
and this is long.
-It is long.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.880
This is the BMW 750 IL,

07:43.920 --> 07:46.280
as Q called it in the Bond
film Tomorrow Never Dies.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.720
JAMES: Did he?
BOTH: He did.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.240
-Nobody told him?
-Nobody on set said,

07:50.280 --> 07:52.080
"Desmond,
that's not what it says."

07:52.120 --> 07:54.040
You would think,
wouldn't you? Oh, well.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.800
And in the film,
they use 740s rebadged.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.320
JAMES: Do they?
-Yeah. This is the real deal.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.320
-The 5.4 litre V12.
JAMES: Hmm.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.120
And all I paid for it
was £8,400.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.560
That is one hell
of a lot of car.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.960
I only paid £3,000
for my Cadillac.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.440
That's a Cadillac.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.400
Yes, the point I'm gonna make
is what kind of a moron

08:18.440 --> 08:20.080
in Germany said,

08:20.120 --> 08:23.480
"Zere's Audi, zere's BMW,
zere's Mercedes.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.920
I should buy a Cadillac."

08:24.960 --> 08:27.640
In fact, I know exactly.
You know those Germans

08:27.680 --> 08:29.320
you see that think
they're Hell's Angels?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.720
-They're dentists, but they
have Harley Davidsons.
-Yes?

08:31.760 --> 08:34.320
And they go
to the Oktoberfest
and they drink Budweiser.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.720
Yes, well, I know
the Germans you mean.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.240
No, it... You're wrong.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.720
Because the previous
owner of that car

08:39.760 --> 08:42.000
was an American
general living in Germany.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.400
-Was he?
-A general?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.040
An American general
and he bought that because

08:45.080 --> 08:47.400
he recognised what Cadillac
intended with that car,

08:47.440 --> 08:50.080
which is to take
on Audi, BMW, Mercedes,

08:50.120 --> 08:52.280
directly with that car
with the Northstar engine.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.600
Oh, yes, they were
very successful with that,
Europe is full of Cadillacs.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.840
-Yeah, you see them
everywhere.
-You never see an Audi.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.640
JEREMY: Tripping over these.
-Rarity and exclusivity are part
of luxury.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.520
-Let's have a look at yours.
-Mine, honestly,
is in perfect nick.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.040
-It's um...absolutely fine.
-I saw that. I saw that.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.280
-Saw what? Nothing to see.
-That's got double glazing
in it and has gone wrong.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.000
Oh, wait a minute,
is your... Come on!

09:12.040 --> 09:13.600
What's the disease?
It's got...

09:13.640 --> 09:16.160
-James, is that
between the panes?
-Yeah, it's got mumps.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.120
That's the most depressing -
a double-glazed window
with mildew in-between it.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.160
-What's the matter?
-You've got mildew
inside your windows.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.520
-Where?
-There.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.040
-Well, it's just, it's...
-That's really poor.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.200
Oh, my God! Basically,
it's disappearing
before your eyes.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.520
JAMES: How can a German car...
Sure it's a real one?

09:33.520 --> 09:35.400
Was it parked in the sea
when you bought it?

09:35.440 --> 09:38.520
Let's not get bogged down
with the oxidisation
of my car.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.120
Because a lot of Chinese
people, as we know,
come to Europe these days.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.640
Mostly to go to the
Mr Shopping Village.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.120
Which is now a bigger tourist
attraction for the Chinese
in England

09:48.160 --> 09:49.720
than Buckingham Palace -
true fact.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.280
-Anybody else find that faintly
depressing?
-Very depressing.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.200
If Chinese people
are going to come to the UK

09:55.240 --> 09:57.880
and buy Western soap
and Western frocks,

09:57.960 --> 10:00.480
why would they not
buy Western cars
when they're there?

10:00.520 --> 10:03.520
RICHARD: Yeah,
you can't buy these cars
second-hand over here.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.640
-No, this vintage isn't
available here.
-No.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.040
JAMES: No.
-Because when these cars were
new, everyone in China had...

10:09.080 --> 10:10.880
-Bicycles.
-Yes! Or oxen.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.240
-Yeah.
-And what we're saying is,

10:12.280 --> 10:13.840
you can buy one of these

10:13.880 --> 10:17.000
for a lot less than
a luxury Hongqi.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.520
-A lot, lot less.
-And that's what we're here
to prove, people of China.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.600
JEREMY: We couldn't have
chosen a better location
for our test -

10:27.640 --> 10:32.640
the absolutely mind-blowing
city of Chongqing.

10:46.520 --> 10:51.000
Let me give you a few facts
and figures, if I may,
about Chongqing.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.080
Population in the municipal
area of around 30 million,

10:54.120 --> 10:57.120
so it's one of the biggest
cities in the world.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.400
14 different car makers here,
so it's China's Motown.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.880
And it's the capital
of the Chinese
motorcycling industry.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.400
And they made
100 million laptops
here last year.

11:15.960 --> 11:20.360
Apparently the city is
twinned with Leicester
and you can see why.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.520
Apart from...
everything about it.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.440
Oh, look, a train going
through a building.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.720
Obviously.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.520
It's an
amazing-looking place.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.520
The people of Dubai think
they're good at knocking up
a building quickly,

11:38.560 --> 11:40.480
but look at the stuff
being built here.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.400
JEREMY: Of course when a city
gets this big, this fast,

11:48.440 --> 11:51.880
there are many ways
to make money.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.760
There's steel

11:55.800 --> 11:57.240
and glass

11:57.280 --> 11:58.560
and concrete.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.440
But one man thought,
"Hold on,

12:01.480 --> 12:04.640
every one of the rooms
in every one of
those buildings...

12:06.360 --> 12:09.240
..is going to need a door."

12:09.280 --> 12:11.120
Genius.

12:11.160 --> 12:16.960
No brainer on the Dragons'
Den, that's for sure.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.840
It was such a good idea,
he now has
a drive-through door factory.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.560
RICHARD: Security doors,

12:33.600 --> 12:37.200
front doors,
interior doors...

12:37.240 --> 12:39.320
...really
fancy-shmancy doors.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.080
Ornate doors,
bank vault...

12:41.120 --> 12:43.040
Car doors.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.880
JEREMY: Five million
of them last year:
five million doors.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.840
Well, that's not very
interesting, is it?

12:49.880 --> 12:54.640
Yes, but now I'm
the richest man in the world.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.120
"If employee
is angel overtime,

12:57.160 --> 12:59.920
it is not devil
when they get salary."

12:59.960 --> 13:03.920
OK, he's not
a brilliant writer,
but what a maker of doors!

13:08.400 --> 13:11.280
JEREMY: The most noticeable
thing about Chongqing,
though...

13:12.440 --> 13:14.560
...is the heat.

13:14.600 --> 13:19.360
This is called
the furnace of China.

13:19.400 --> 13:24.120
Average daily temperatures,
this time of year, which is,
mid-July,

13:24.160 --> 13:26.080
45 degrees.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.040
With 80% humidity.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.760
This place is hot.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.520
Like mega hot.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.760
It's so hot and so sticky

13:37.800 --> 13:40.320
that five minutes after
putting up a building,

13:40.360 --> 13:43.680
the jungle
is growing out of it.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.520
And this is OK

13:45.560 --> 13:47.760
if you're in
an air-conditioned BMW

13:47.800 --> 13:49.040
or Cadillac.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.760
However...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.920
I'm gonna have to tell you
that the air-conditioning

13:53.960 --> 13:55.960
simply doesn't work
in my car.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.600
Please, no. Not here.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.600
Have you heard the news?
James's aircon.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.240
-What?
-(MOUTHS)

14:07.280 --> 14:09.960
Oh, dear.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.480
-(LAUGHS)
-Oh!

14:11.520 --> 14:13.360
Oh, that...
he's gonna feel that.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.320
-Ho-ho!
-(LAUGHS)

14:17.320 --> 14:19.000
JEREMY:
Aircon issues aside, though,

14:19.040 --> 14:22.000
it did seem like we were
on to something with our

14:22.040 --> 14:24.240
pre-owned Western limousines.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.240
Cars here cost round about

14:30.280 --> 14:32.200
twice as much
as they do in the UK

14:32.240 --> 14:34.240
because of taxes and...

14:34.280 --> 14:36.280
profiteering
from the car companies.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.480
So if you see someone
in a Range Rover Velar
as I just did,

14:40.520 --> 14:43.200
that here is £140,000.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.960
Yeah, I mean, that S-Class
there, if that's a tasty one,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.320
that's a £300,000 car
in China.

14:52.360 --> 14:56.800
And that's why
this BMW makes sense.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.320
You could come to Europe,

14:58.360 --> 15:02.160
pick up a 750IL like this
for £8,500,

15:02.200 --> 15:04.880
pay for the shipping
to China, pay the taxes,

15:04.920 --> 15:09.880
and it would still cost you
less than a Honda Civic.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.000
And it's not like this
is on its last legs.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.400
I don't have a single thing
in here that's broken.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.000
Steering wheel adjuster,

15:18.040 --> 15:20.280
unlike in the Hongqi,
is working.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.320
Indicators, lights, stereo -
everything. Everything works.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.440
Windows.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.680
I've even got
a cassette player.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.200
Look at that.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.280
RICHARD: All my electrics
were working too.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.520
But actually,
in this superheated-city,

15:38.560 --> 15:41.400
there's an even better reason
for buying a Cadillac.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.920
When Americans build a car,

15:44.960 --> 15:47.320
they start with the
air-conditioning unit

15:47.360 --> 15:49.760
and then say, "Right,
let's fit a car to it.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.560
It's top priority."

15:52.600 --> 15:54.160
Speaking of which...

15:54.200 --> 15:56.760
What this is, viewers,
if you were wondering,

15:56.800 --> 15:58.440
is something called
an ice towel.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.440
You soak it in water and
it remains cool
for up to two hours.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.520
Borrowed it from one of
the crew. It's fantastic.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.360
JEREMY: Eventually,
we decided to leave

16:09.400 --> 16:12.120
the centre of the biggest
city you've never heard of.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.000
So we negotiated

16:15.040 --> 16:17.760
this gentleman's
sausage-shaped junction

16:17.800 --> 16:20.200
to try our cars
on the freeway.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.960
Where, immediately,
we had a problem.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.920
(CLICKING)

16:29.920 --> 16:32.160
Every few hundred yards,

16:32.200 --> 16:35.360
there's a gantry with cameras
covering all the lanes.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.960
And every single car
is photographed.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.640
And every single photograph
is then analysed by...

16:43.680 --> 16:48.920
..an official in a room
to make sure
the driver is smoking.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.800
Because as far
as I can work out,

16:51.840 --> 16:54.480
that is still
compulsory here.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.320
Other things -
well, they're making sure

16:56.360 --> 16:58.840
that you have
your seatbelt done up,

16:58.880 --> 17:01.280
that you're not talking
on a mobile phone.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.920
And that you're not...

17:02.960 --> 17:04.920
Oh, how can I put this?

17:04.960 --> 17:08.160
...touching either yourself
or your passenger.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.040
Apparently
that's a thing in China.

17:10.080 --> 17:15.320
Quite a few people
are prosecuted
for pleasuring themselves,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.200
or one another,
on a long journey.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.680
JAMES: Yes! Oh, yes.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.760
Ohh! Oh, yes.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.720
That is...
that's actually really nice.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.560
Ow!
Shit, I've fanned my todger.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.080
JEREMY: Eventually,
we arrived at the location

17:40.160 --> 17:42.280
for our first test.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.240
It's one of 78 centres
around Chongqing

17:46.280 --> 17:50.880
where teenagers can learn to
drive away from the traffic.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.320
To us, however,
it looked like a racetrack.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.680
Which made it perfect for
an ingenious handling test

17:57.720 --> 17:59.280
that I'd just thought of.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.520
Now, to do this, we're gonna
use drones, like this one,

18:04.560 --> 18:06.960
which have been fitted
with flamethrowers.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.320
They actually use these
in China for clearing um...

18:11.400 --> 18:14.640
litter that's got stuck
on overhead power cables.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.800
Right. So how are we
going to use airborne
flamethrowers, like this,

18:19.880 --> 18:22.880
to test the power
and agility of our cars?

18:22.920 --> 18:25.680
Good question.
Each of our cars has,
as you can see,

18:25.720 --> 18:28.280
been fitted with
three chains of firecrackers.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.560
One on the bonnet,
one on the roof,
one on the boot lid. OK?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.320
So you drive round
a special course here,

18:33.400 --> 18:36.280
while you're attacked by
the airborne flamethrowers.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.440
And then you score a point
when you've finished

18:39.480 --> 18:42.800
for every one of the targets
that haven't gone off.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.520
Since we were up against
two geeky millennials

18:49.560 --> 18:53.040
and we'd be driving
powerful Western saloons,

18:53.080 --> 18:55.080
we figured we could
outrun and outsmart

18:55.160 --> 18:57.560
the drones easily.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.800
♪ Flight Of The Valkyries

19:00.800 --> 19:04.760
-(TYRES SCREECH)
-Sadly, though,
it was a massacre.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.560
-Ah, fire from the sky!
-(FIRECRACKERS POP)

19:11.640 --> 19:13.040
Agh! Agh!

19:13.080 --> 19:14.440
(POPPING AND FIZZING)

19:18.080 --> 19:20.000
(TYRES SCREECH)

19:21.440 --> 19:22.920
-(POPPING)
-Agh! Agh!

19:24.480 --> 19:26.640
There's the drone on my left.
The first one.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.280
(TYRES SCREECH)

19:31.760 --> 19:33.440
-(POPPING AND FIZZING)
-Ah, God.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.200
God's truth!

19:39.560 --> 19:41.320
-(POPPING)
-Ohh!

19:45.080 --> 19:47.880
Fire everywhere.
Oh, God.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.560
Bandit at ten o'clock.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.240
(TYRES SCREECH)

19:57.640 --> 20:00.720
Oh, no! Oh, shit!

20:00.760 --> 20:03.160
-That will have alarmed him.
-It will have slightly, yeah.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.520
-You know,
dogs don't like fireworks?
-No, they hate it.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.880
-(FIRECRACKERS POPPING)
-Agh! Aagh! Arghh! Aaargh!

20:22.560 --> 20:23.800
(APPLAUSE)

20:23.880 --> 20:26.640
JEREMY:
That was such a good laugh.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.920
Belting around
with airborne flamethrowers.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.320
-Really good afternoon,
that was.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.640
-What?
-Hang on.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.080
-Yeah?
-That was
a totally useless test.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.280
-Why was it?
-Well, we did nothing

20:40.320 --> 20:42.080
to convince
Chinese business people

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
that our second-hand limos
were a good idea.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.160
And we all scored nought.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.560
-Yeah, and we all ruined
our paintwork as well.
-Yes, but it'll buff out.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.040
-No, it won't.
-Well, it might.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.160
Anyway, we shall pick
that up later on.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.000
But now, it is time for us

20:56.040 --> 20:58.440
to splash
in some puddles of chat...

20:58.480 --> 21:01.200
-(LAUGHTER)
-...left by
the drizzle of debate

21:01.240 --> 21:04.320
that falls
on Conversation Street.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.320
(MELLOW JAZZ)

21:08.000 --> 21:10.280
(LAUGHTER)

21:10.320 --> 21:12.800
RICHARD: I like that one.
I like that one.
-Yeah, I know.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.160
Damn.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.040
We'll stick with China.
If we may.

21:19.080 --> 21:22.240
Um...before we were allowed
to drive over there,

21:22.280 --> 21:24.440
we all had to sit
Chinese driving tests.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.400
Now, we've seen driving tests
around the world.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.400
I remember one in India
I encountered once,

21:28.440 --> 21:32.720
where a woman passed,
even though she was
in the back of the car.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.160
And her examiner
was in another car

21:35.200 --> 21:37.160
-following along behind.
-Yeah.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.560
Used to be in Egypt
that you had to drive
six feet forwards,

21:40.640 --> 21:43.320
but then six feet backwards
and then you'd pass.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.640
-And that was it.
-I'd love to meet somebody
who failed that.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.560
Yeah. Anyhow,
so we figured that
to get a Chinese driving test

21:48.640 --> 21:50.800
it would be, you know,
quite an easy test.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.440
However, we were
in for a bit of a surprise.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.760
Now, um...I actually
got some footage
of Hammond taking his test.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.360
-Does anyone wanna see it?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

21:59.400 --> 22:02.360
It's poor quality, it's on
my phone, but here we go.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.120
JEREMY:
Test centre.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.560
Right, so he has
to ball his fists.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.960
Then a squat. There he goes.
There he goes.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.160
And then he has to get
on some weigh scales.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.400
Tense moment here,
tense moment.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.360
Still tense.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.320
You passed!
Hammond has passed!

22:25.360 --> 22:27.600
-(LAUGHTER)
-Seriously...

22:27.640 --> 22:29.120
-(APPLAUSE)
-Well done.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.120
-That was it.
-Yes!

22:31.160 --> 22:34.280
It was nothing.
I made it look easy.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.840
That was, well,
it was the easiest driving
test I've ever heard of.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.480
Basically I passed because I
proved that my hands do that

22:40.520 --> 22:42.280
and I'm affected by gravity.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.080
-That's it.
-I think it is actually
just a test to check

22:45.120 --> 22:47.080
that you are a human being
and not a dog.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.480
-Cos they can't...
-Sure it was.
However, afterwards,

22:49.520 --> 22:51.240
we were taken in
to a sort of lecture theatre

22:51.280 --> 22:53.560
by a man who...

22:53.600 --> 22:56.280
talked us through the perils
of the road in China.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.000
And he said that
we had to look out
for a number of things

22:59.040 --> 23:00.960
running out into the road,
in front of us.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.240
Including, and I'm not -
this is a quote, yes?

23:03.280 --> 23:05.320
You will back me up on this.
This is what he said.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.160
Including dogs, children,
and women.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.160
-(LAUGHTER)
-That's what he said.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.320
-He said that.
-"Be careful,
they run out into the road."

23:12.360 --> 23:14.280
"You never know,
they're unpredictable."

23:14.320 --> 23:15.600
(LAUGHTER)

23:15.640 --> 23:18.280
I don't think
the #MeToo movement

23:18.320 --> 23:20.040
has reached
Chongqing just yet.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.720
No. Mind you,
you say that,

23:21.760 --> 23:26.560
there are 78 self-made
billionaire women
in the whole world.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.680
-And 49 of them are Chinese.
-Yeah.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.120
Well, there would be more,
but some of them
got run over.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.720
(LAUGHTER)

23:33.760 --> 23:36.320
Anyway, look, can we talk
about that Hongqi for a bit?

23:36.360 --> 23:37.840
I knew you'd
want to talk about that.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.920
-It's so you.
-It's interesting.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.000
-It's so you.
-It's got him
written all over it.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.480
Bad news, though,
you can't have it in brown.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.280
Why would I want it in brown?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.760
-Oh, yes, you would.
-You love a brown car.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.760
Your cars are grey
and dark green.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.320
Mine are blue, metal fake,
red, and orange.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.960
I can't see into your mind.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.360
God knows
I'm not sure I want to.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.800
But...I know James May,

23:59.840 --> 24:02.680
as you drift off
to sleepy bobos tonight,

24:02.720 --> 24:05.840
a brown Hongqi
will be driving...

24:05.880 --> 24:07.200
(LAUGHTER)

24:07.240 --> 24:08.920
"But I don't like
brown cars."

24:08.960 --> 24:10.680
-It's like him saying,
"I love horses."
-Ha-ha.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.000
Things that aren't true.
Things that aren't true.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.040
You love a brown car and you
can't have it in brown.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.440
I've never had a brown car
and I am interested
in the Hongqi.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.280
-So tell us more about it.
-OK.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.520
Something I didn't say
in the film, which is
quite interesting,

24:21.560 --> 24:25.840
is that when you order one,
they send a tailor round
to your place of business.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.760
And he measures
you up for a suit

24:27.800 --> 24:30.600
that you then wear when you
take delivery of the car.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.360
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.120
I'd actually quite like
to be the tailor

24:34.160 --> 24:35.440
who made the suit for you

24:35.480 --> 24:37.680
when you take delivery
of your Hongqi.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.440
It would have
some writing on it.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.640
-Would it?
-Not in Chinese,
it would be in English.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.960
Would it be a pithy
description of the wearer?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.520
Yes, that's what it was.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
It's funny you
should say that, because...

24:48.440 --> 24:51.760
in China there's a tendency
for people to wear clothing

24:51.800 --> 24:53.880
with English words,
you know, written on them.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.840
They've obviously got no idea
what those words say.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.640
I was sitting in
a traffic jam one day there

24:58.680 --> 25:01.800
and there was a woman
on a bus next to me.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.400
And she was
a perfectly respectable,
50-something woman

25:04.440 --> 25:06.800
on her way obviously
to an office job or whatever.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.040
She was wearing
a white blouse
with red flowers on it.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.360
Now, I took a picture.
Here it is.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.000
And what that says is,
"He was a (BLEEP) asshole."

25:15.040 --> 25:16.240
(LAUGHTER)

25:18.160 --> 25:20.960
I would love a picture
of her face when somebody

25:21.000 --> 25:22.920
explained to her
what it said on her shirt.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.440
Do you know what's really
amazing about that?

25:25.480 --> 25:28.520
That's exactly what
I was gonna have
put on your Hongqi suit.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.520
-She knew.
-She knew!

25:31.560 --> 25:34.080
I wanna get back to cars,
if I may.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.480
Because there's some truly
astonishing stats, really,

25:37.520 --> 25:39.040
about cars in China.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.960
We've got a graph here of
global car production, yes?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.240
There's the UK
in tenth place.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.880
We made 1.67 million cars
here in 2017.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.760
Japan 8.35 million.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.360
China, let's put it up.

25:52.400 --> 25:57.080
RICHARD: Mind-blowing!
-24.8 million cars
they made there.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.760
And what's extraordinary is
that you can't just buy a car
and then use it.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.000
You have to apply to a
government-run lottery

26:05.040 --> 26:07.560
for a registration plate
for your car.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.560
Now here's one, OK?

26:09.600 --> 26:12.720
In Beijing last year,
for every thousand people

26:12.760 --> 26:14.960
who applied
for a registration plate

26:15.000 --> 26:16.360
for a car
they intended to buy...

26:16.400 --> 26:17.840
For every thousand
who applied,

26:17.880 --> 26:19.760
how many do you think
actually got one?

26:19.800 --> 26:21.960
-500.
-200.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.680
-600.
BOTH: 300.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.280
-Three.
-Three people?

26:25.320 --> 26:27.160
For every thousand people
who applied,

26:27.200 --> 26:29.920
only three actually got
a registration plate,

26:29.960 --> 26:32.040
were allowed to buy a car.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.840
This is good conversation,
this whole issue actually.
It's really interesting.

26:35.880 --> 26:41.040
Would you like to guess
what was the bestselling car
in China in 2017?

26:41.080 --> 26:46.360
Well, Volkswagen have been
there forever, so I'm
gonna say the Passat.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.080
I'm gonna say
it's a mid-sized Hyundai

26:49.120 --> 26:52.360
-of some sort,
sort of boxy thing.
-And you're both wrong.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.680
It's the Wuling Hongguang.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.320
-(LAUGHTER)
-What, that?

26:56.360 --> 26:58.200
Yep, there it is.
That's the fella.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.600
That's the bestselling-car
in China?

26:59.640 --> 27:02.920
They sold half a million
of them in China in 2017.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.720
-Really?
-Half a million
of those were sold, yeah.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.600
They sold... Well,
half a million of...Wu...

27:08.640 --> 27:10.160
-Wuling Hongguang.
-Those.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.160
That's more than
the Ford Focus.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.640
Yeah, and don't forget the
Ford Focus is sold globally.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.800
That's just sold in China.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.880
The car, the Chinese car,
that caught my eye,
I must say,

27:19.920 --> 27:22.120
was the Bestune T77.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.040
-Familiar with it?
-Oh, the Best... No.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.280
-Never heard of it.
-No, exactly.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.160
We've got
a picture of it here.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.480
It looks a bit like the
Lamborghini from last week,
the Urus.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.160
But it's much smaller, 1.2-litre
engine SUV.
All quite normal.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.320
Except it comes
with something called
a dashboard assistant.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.680
Which is a little holographic
figure that pops up

27:40.720 --> 27:42.960
and you talk to it and it
helps you set the satnav

27:43.000 --> 27:45.200
-and make phone calls
and so on.
-That's very hi-tech.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.480
Except the little holographic
figure is of a Japanese -

27:49.520 --> 27:51.920
a Japanese schoolgirl.

27:51.960 --> 27:56.400
And then you can choose
what colour miniskirt
you'd like her to wear.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.760
Got a picture...
I'm not making it up.
There's a picture here.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.480
(LAUGHTER)

28:02.520 --> 28:04.160
I'm not sure about that.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.720
I'm not either, but here's
the thing, James,

28:06.760 --> 28:10.240
the Chinese don't care
what we think, anybody.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.240
Cos they look at us
like we look at cows.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.480
We're just big daft things
standing around.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.360
Only instead of milk,
we give them luggage
and watches.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.280
(LAUGHTER)

28:21.320 --> 28:23.480
That's actually the end
of Conversation Street.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.720
It's not the end, however,
of the Chinese stuff.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.960
Because we had a call the
other day from a Chinese car
manufacturer called NIO.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.600
And they said, "We have built
a blisteringly fast,
all-electric supercar.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.800
And would one of you
like to try it out?"

28:38.840 --> 28:41.920
Yeah, now after his escapade
going up a Swiss hill

28:41.960 --> 28:44.600
in a blisteringly fast,
all-electric supercar,

28:44.640 --> 28:48.440
Richard Hammond said
that he really didn't think
he was the man for the job.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.520
However, it turned out

28:50.560 --> 28:52.600
that the car was only
available for one day

28:52.640 --> 28:55.320
and unfortunately
on that day, I had the
boiler man coming round.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.240
-Yeah. And I had
a dental appoint...
-Dentist.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.680
Dental appointment, yeah.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.680
Yep. So, guess what?

29:11.840 --> 29:13.560
(GLASS TINKLING)

29:15.160 --> 29:16.840
RICHARD: Here it is.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.560
It's called the EP9.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.960
And it's pretty clear
that this is no Nissan Leaf.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.320
Because a Leaf doesn't have
giant head restraints

29:30.360 --> 29:32.800
to stop G-forces
from snapping your neck

29:32.840 --> 29:34.760
during hard cornering.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.120
And that's
just the start of it.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.640
What I have here
is a comparison

29:44.680 --> 29:47.040
between this NIO EP9

29:47.080 --> 29:49.240
and the Rimac Concept One,

29:49.280 --> 29:51.760
in which I had my little,
um...

29:51.800 --> 29:55.200
tumble down
a Swiss mountainside.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.360
So in the Rimac Concept One,

29:57.400 --> 30:02.680
power:
1,207 brake horsepower.

30:02.720 --> 30:09.200
In this NIO,
1,341 brake horsepower.

30:09.240 --> 30:14.240
Power to weight:
in the Rimac is 652
brake horsepower per ton.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.840
In this NIO,

30:15.880 --> 30:19.440
773 brake horsepower per ton.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.080
Oh, good.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.640
So, no pressure, then.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.600
Right. The high voltage
system is active.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.520
So here goes. To launch,
it's gotta be in drive.

you get from these

However, there is some good

My lungs are
on the front again.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.960
Oh.

32:11.800 --> 32:16.120
Now if you want to experience
this phenomenal speed
for yourself,

32:16.160 --> 32:18.520
you will need two things.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.720
First of all, a lot of money.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.800
Because this costs
£1.15 million.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.240
Secondly, a racetrack.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.560
Because it works like
that Ferrari FXX -

32:33.600 --> 32:36.320
where you buy the car, they
deliver it to a track for you

32:36.360 --> 32:37.880
along with a support team.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.000
You drive it, crap yourself,

32:40.040 --> 32:42.520
then they take it away
and hose it out for you.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.200
Since it's an electric car,

32:45.240 --> 32:47.520
you'll be wondering
about range.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.160
Obviously if you hammer it
round a track,

32:50.200 --> 32:52.760
you are gonna wear those
batteries out pretty quickly.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.840
However, on the plus side,

32:54.880 --> 32:56.600
they only take
45 minutes to charge.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.440
On the minus side,

33:07.480 --> 33:10.560
you have to take
the batteries out to do it.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.160
And as they weigh
317 kilograms each,

33:14.200 --> 33:16.000
you won't be doing that
on your own.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.560
It is a bit more of a faff
than say, a can of petrol.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.000
However, if you're
an electric petrol head

33:32.040 --> 33:34.040
and you're tempted
by the NIO,

33:34.080 --> 33:35.520

interested to know

33:35.560 --> 33:38.080
that it's not
short of pedigree.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.360

the people behind this thing

33:40.400 --> 33:42.320
really know
what they're doing.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.120
For starters,
the outfit that makes the EP9

33:47.160 --> 33:50.360
also runs a Formula E team:

33:50.400 --> 33:54.120
one which won the inaugural
championship in 2015.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.120
And until recently,

33:59.160 --> 34:03.800
the EP9 itself
held a lap record
around the Nurburgring,

34:03.840 --> 34:05.360
with an astonishing time of

34:05.400 --> 34:08.920
6 minutes 45.9 seconds.

34:11.160 --> 34:14.160

35:51.760 --> 35:54.640
Thanks for sticking me
with that.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.600
You know, um...
it's interesting.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.920
Watching that
has convinced me

35:59.960 --> 36:03.960
that I will never buy
an electric car
as long as I live.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.400
-Why not?
-Because why on Earth

36:07.440 --> 36:09.800
would I want to employ
a team of men

36:09.840 --> 36:12.880
and buy a forklift every time
I need to go anywhere?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.880
Yeah, that's all very well,
but a lot of people

36:14.920 --> 36:16.840
are more enlightened than
you, including me, in fact.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.360
-So, Hammond?
-Yes?

36:18.400 --> 36:21.800
Tell me, what are the...
how does it compare
with the Rimac?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.800
-Nobody's interested.
-Yes, they are. Shut up.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.640
The NIO, it's just, the NIO
is just more of everything.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.960
It's more power,
more grip, more speed.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.640
I have to say, that looked
painfully fast, that car.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.400
It is.
It is astonishingly fast.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.440
But it is a novelty.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.160
An amazing powerfully
fast one, but a novelty
nevertheless.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.360
And we should make it
absolutely clear you can't drive
it on the road at all.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.120
-It's not road legal.
-No, you can't.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.400
The Rimac, you can,
that's what
makes it so amazing.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.920
And there's a new Rimac
coming out soon

36:48.960 --> 36:52.520
that'll have more than
1900 horsepower.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.520
But imagine the size of the
internal combustion engine

36:54.560 --> 36:56.640
you would need
to make 1900 horsepower.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.440
-It would be...
-It'd be massive.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.880
That's why the future
of supercars like that
is electric.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.920
-It is.
-What?

37:04.960 --> 37:07.080
-It just isn't.
RICHARD AND JAMES: It is.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.480
That's the way it's gonna go.
It's the way it is going.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.920
OK, then, let's find out how
fast your beloved NIO

37:12.960 --> 37:15.040
goes around the Eboladrome.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.880
(WHOOSH)

37:16.920 --> 37:20.520
And it's off to
the sound of the spin cycle.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.920
Jiggling around on its
racing car suspension,

37:23.960 --> 37:25.880
as it powers onto the Isn't.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.200
That's exciting.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.640
A lift and then
building up speed again.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.120
That is looking pretty brisk.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.640
Right, now down into
Your Name Here.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.680
Sparks flashing off
the rear diffuser.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.560
Torque vectoring should be
doing its stuff round here
to keep it in place.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.440
(HIGH-PITCHED WHINE)

37:48.480 --> 37:50.440
And now back to full voltage

37:50.480 --> 37:53.560
for the frantic whirr
back down the Isn't.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.040
Sounding more like
a jet fighter

37:55.080 --> 37:56.800
and less like a Zanussi now.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.440
OK, hard braking
for Old Lady's House.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.160
More milk floaty noises.

38:04.160 --> 38:08.520
And now the run
to Substation.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.120
If it crashes here,
there really will be
a lot of sparks.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.640
OK, two corners left.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.800
Very tidy through there.
Just Field of Sheep to go.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.320
Keeps it neat
and across the line.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.480
RICHARD: That looked good.
JEREMY: She did well there.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.440
-She did do well.
-She did well.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.520
So exciting
with those noises.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.800
-I like the noises.
-What? You can't like
those...

38:31.840 --> 38:34.320
-There's a whole new set
of noises, you pillock.
-(LAUGHTER)

38:34.360 --> 38:35.800
-OK.
-It's the future.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.320
OK, let's see how fast your
elegantly entitled N ten,

38:39.360 --> 38:40.880
-no, NIO...
-NIO.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.280
-...EP9...
-Yes.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.800
...got round, shall we?
Here we go.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.800
JEREMY: Top ten?
RICHARD: Come on.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.840
There you go.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, oh, yes!

38:48.880 --> 38:50.920
-Come on. Come on!
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)

38:50.960 --> 38:53.280
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.440
That...

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
That is faster...

38:58.200 --> 39:00.640
faster than
the Aston Martin Vulcan.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.080
You're absolutely right,
Hammond.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.120
It is a very impressive car.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.760
And it is faster
than a Vulcan.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.600
But it's slower

39:07.640 --> 39:10.280
than the petrol-powered
McLaren Senna,

39:10.320 --> 39:11.760
which is road legal.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.920
-So that is petrol: one...
-Yes.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.680
Electricity: zero!

39:15.760 --> 39:17.000
All right,
don't do that face.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.760
Don't do that face!

39:19.880 --> 39:21.080
-No.
-Smug face.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.280
Not the smug face. I don't...

39:23.320 --> 39:26.920
James,
just move it on, quick.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.160
Yes, in this show
we are explaining
to the people of China

39:30.200 --> 39:32.360
that they don't need to waste
huge sums of money

39:32.400 --> 39:35.280
on new luxury cars when they
could buy something used

39:35.320 --> 39:37.400
from Europe for a lot less.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.840
Now so far,
we've done city driving.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.480
We've done motorway driving.

39:41.520 --> 39:44.080
And we've done a completely
pointless handling test

39:44.120 --> 39:45.800
-that Jeremy devised.
RICHARD: Yep!

39:45.840 --> 39:47.760
And now we had
to get to a rally stage

39:47.800 --> 39:49.960
to take part in another test
that he dreamt up

39:50.000 --> 39:52.440
whilst enjoying another
night on the pneumonia.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.920
(LAUGHTER)

39:53.960 --> 39:55.480
Whatever, OK.
However, listen,

39:55.520 --> 39:58.360
before we left the
test centre where we did
the flamethrower -

39:58.400 --> 40:00.160
the flamethrower
handling test -

40:00.200 --> 40:04.520
we popped next door
to something called the
Zunyi Conference centre.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.400
It was on this very spot,
in 1935,

40:11.440 --> 40:14.200
that Chairman Mao
unveiled the plans

40:14.280 --> 40:16.480
for the future
of his country.

40:18.680 --> 40:22.600
This then is the birthplace
of Communism in China,

40:22.640 --> 40:26.960
and today it stands
as an anti-Capitalist shrine.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.520
Naturally we headed
straight for the gift shop.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.160
-(CASH REGISTER BEEPING)
-Oh, that is exquisite.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.680
Yes, I'll definitely have
a Chairman Mao snow globe.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.480
RICHARD: That one.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.000
-Oh, look.
-(WOMAN GIGGLES)

40:44.040 --> 40:46.080
How much are these?

40:46.120 --> 40:47.400
(CASH REGISTER BEEPS)

40:47.440 --> 40:50.080
So that's 230.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.160
JEREMY: It's Donald Trump.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.760
-I'm absolutely starving.
-Yeah, me too.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.600
-Oh, that's handy.
-That'll do.

40:57.640 --> 41:01.160
Having paid our respects
to Communism...

41:01.200 --> 41:05.360
...we got back on the road
in our fire-damaged cars

41:05.400 --> 41:10.480
with James still moaning
about his temperature issues.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.480
The air conditioning
is now so broken
that it's permanently hot,

41:13.520 --> 41:18.160
even when I turn it to low
and press every auto button.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.480
I decided there was only one
thing I could do about this.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.520
Ignore him.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.840
Jesus!

41:24.880 --> 41:26.560
Look at that.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.360
They're actually building
another motorway

41:28.400 --> 41:29.960
with viaducts and tunnels

41:30.000 --> 41:32.840
on the other side
of the valley.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.520
You've got one motorway.
Why would you need
another one over there?

41:36.560 --> 41:39.400
Still, all these motorways
did mean we could prove

41:39.440 --> 41:43.760
that our cars work well,
as long-distance cruisers.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.760
If you gloss over
the slightly worn,

41:47.800 --> 41:50.160
interior trim on this car,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.840
I am staggered
at how comfortable it is.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.280
Every inch the Cadillac.

41:55.320 --> 42:00.360
It's fitted with something
called continuously variable
road-sensing suspension.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.200
Or suspension.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.560
And there's more.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.640
In Britain,
this car was described as

42:07.640 --> 42:09.640
astonishingly reliable.

42:09.680 --> 42:13.160
Not my words,
the words of the RAC.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.360
The Royal Automobile Club.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.680
The Queen herself
as good as commended

42:18.760 --> 42:22.560
this car's reliability.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.880
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
in the stuck record.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.200
Lovely engine, silky smooth.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.080
Seats are comfortable,

42:30.120 --> 42:33.040
everything works,
except the air conditioning.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.160
I'm running out of fuel.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.480
There's... That's happened
very suddenly.

42:40.520 --> 42:44.480
Er...This is May, how's
everyone doing for fuel?

42:44.520 --> 42:48.200
I have...about
a quarter of a tank.

42:48.280 --> 42:53.120
I'm gonna need more fuel.
The mighty North Star
has drunk it.

42:53.160 --> 42:57.440
JAMES: Happily,
we soon saw signs
for a service station.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.760
That's excellent. I was just
about to start panicking.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.600
Oh.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.640
Small problem here.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.120
It's not open.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.640
JAMES: So we drove
on to the next one.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.640
Oh, thank God.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.600
Where is it?

43:21.400 --> 43:22.800
Where's the fuel?

43:23.920 --> 43:27.320
Oh, it's not finished.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.640
They could even be fuel tanks
waiting to go in.

43:31.280 --> 43:34.120
JAMES: So, we drove on
to the next one.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.280
Please let this one be open.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.440
But that didn't have
fuel either.

43:41.480 --> 43:45.640
How much money are they
spending on service stations?

43:45.640 --> 43:48.840
Well, a lot, but they're not
earning any from them,
I can tell you that.

43:50.920 --> 43:55.640
The problem China has is it's
building motorways so fast

43:55.680 --> 43:58.680
that the people
building the service stations

43:58.720 --> 44:03.120
to supply the motorway with
fuel...can't keep up.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.400
Chaps, my fumes
are running out now.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.040
After passing two more
unfinished service stations,

44:11.080 --> 44:13.440
we finally got lucky.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.280
Oh, thank God.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.440
Ooh, that's a relief.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.880
JEREMY: However, our
problems weren't quite over.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.760
I mean,
is that petrol or diesel?

44:26.800 --> 44:29.040
What... What's that?

44:29.080 --> 44:32.160
Does green
mean petrol or diesel?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.360
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)
-Oooh!

44:35.400 --> 44:37.080
(WOMAN SPEAKS CHINESE)

44:37.120 --> 44:39.560
-Oh, hello.
-How do you know
which fuel is which?

44:39.600 --> 44:43.360
Well, we've no idea.
She just comes. This is
what she just did with mine.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.600
-She just put that in and
I'm going, "Is it petrol--"
-(SPEAKS CHINESE)

44:46.640 --> 44:50.160
She's putting it in
whatever it is.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.360
JEREMY: With the lucky dip
fill-up complete,

44:52.400 --> 44:54.760
we were ready to roll.

44:54.800 --> 44:58.400
However, in the
RAC-approved Cadillac...

44:58.440 --> 45:01.920
-(CLICK, BEEPING)
-Er...my car won't start.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.520
It's the battery.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.240
Or have you filled it up
with Ribena?

45:07.280 --> 45:08.520
(CAR HORN BEEPING)

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
As the rest of China
was keen

45:10.600 --> 45:13.760
to use this one completed
service station,

45:13.800 --> 45:17.720
I had to push Hammond clear
of the pumps.

45:17.760 --> 45:22.360
JEREMY: It's not really
the message we want
to be sending out to...

45:22.400 --> 45:24.720
the people of China,
that our cars have broken.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.840
-(CAR HORN BEEPS)
-I'm doing manual labour.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.840
-I've found the battery.
-(BLEEP)

45:30.880 --> 45:32.880
(ENGINE STARTS)

45:32.920 --> 45:34.560
(ENGINE REVS)

45:34.600 --> 45:36.560
RICHARD: Success.
JAMES: Very good.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.720
Hammond, quite a lot
of Chinese people looking.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.640
Well, that's the jump leads
test done.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.160
We've done
the jump leads test.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.200
If ever we needed them,
we can do it.

45:48.240 --> 45:51.400
-Those Chinese-made
jump leads were excellent.
-Excellent.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.840
Excellent.
Not that we needed them.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.680
RICHARD:
Back on the road,

45:56.720 --> 46:00.160
I was wondering
if the battery
wasn't the only issue.

46:00.200 --> 46:03.800
I can't understand the
German messages on the dash,

46:03.840 --> 46:07.200
but the engine
warning light is on.

46:07.240 --> 46:11.000
I'll be very disappointed
if my glorious North Star
engine lets go.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.080
It's not going to,
it's tough.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.480
It'll be fine.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.120
JEREMY:
In fact, we all had issues.

46:22.160 --> 46:26.360
Chief among which was trying
to understand the road signs.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.600
Don't "dring" when... What?

46:30.640 --> 46:33.240
Don't "drmng" when tired.
"Drmng."

46:33.280 --> 46:36.160
JEREMY:
Descent length surplus.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.800
Over-speeding prohibition.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.760
Don't drmng when tired,
again.

46:40.800 --> 46:45.120
(LAUGHING) We've got a lot
of don't drmnging when tired.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.960
There was another
problem too.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.440
The roads had no drainage.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.760
So, even in a shower...

46:52.880 --> 46:55.120
JAMES: Look at that.

46:55.160 --> 46:59.200
The cars on the other side
are sending fountains of
water onto this one.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.240
Whoa.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.480
Aquaplaning.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.160
Holy moley.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.280
That man's dropped...
His crash helmet's actually
come off his head.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.560
Still, at least when it got
dark, things got worse.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.920
(CLICKING)

47:26.080 --> 47:30.040
Whoa! Whoa!

47:30.080 --> 47:33.280
They'll give you epilepsy,
these cameras.

47:33.320 --> 47:35.320
Constantly being flashed.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.000
JEREMY: After this long
and difficult journey,

47:42.040 --> 47:44.840
we reached
the overnight halt...

47:44.880 --> 47:49.440
...where we were hoping
to unwind with some
relaxing comfort food.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.080
(SIZZLING AND BUBBLING)

47:52.640 --> 47:54.760
Holy cow, that is hot!

47:56.840 --> 47:58.120
How... Oh, jeez.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.480
RICHARD:
Oh...oh...

47:59.520 --> 48:02.480
-What...what...
-That's goose intestines.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.040
Goose intest...
Do you want some?

48:04.080 --> 48:07.240
I've seen more
appetising things than that

48:07.280 --> 48:09.160
stuck to the back of
my terrier.

48:09.200 --> 48:12.080
A rub... Ooh!
...rubber hosepipe...

48:12.120 --> 48:14.400
-Nice.
-...coated in napalm.

48:14.440 --> 48:16.680
(BLEEP) hell!

48:16.720 --> 48:20.640
As our mouths melted,
I brought up
another idea I'd had.

48:20.680 --> 48:25.520
We really should be in
the back of these cars,
because...

48:25.560 --> 48:28.560
-I agree, yeah.
-...if you're
a Chinese businessman

48:28.600 --> 48:31.160
you're not gonna drive a car,
a 750IL or a Cadillac,
are you?

48:31.200 --> 48:32.760
You're gonna be in the back.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.040
Actually it's more
relevant here anyway,
isn't it?

48:35.080 --> 48:37.400
-That's what
people care about.
-It's all they care about.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.080
The rear seat accommodation,
leg room.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.880
Now, Jaguar, Audi,
Mercedes and BMW

48:42.920 --> 48:44.960
all make long cars

48:45.000 --> 48:48.920
specifically for
the Chinese market.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.680
So, look, why don't we...
I'm sure we could do this.

48:51.720 --> 48:55.040
Why don't we hire some local
chauffeurs to drive our cars

48:55.080 --> 48:58.000
and we'll ride in the back,
which is what we should be
doing.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.800
-That's a proper place
to assess them.
-Mm, that is a good idea.

49:00.840 --> 49:04.440
And how's this for taking it
one step further?

49:06.000 --> 49:09.800
Why don't we, tonight,
modify our cars...

49:09.840 --> 49:13.080
...to make them more
relevant and luxurious

49:13.120 --> 49:16.000
for the Chinese
business community?

49:16.040 --> 49:19.200
OK, and while we're at it,

49:19.240 --> 49:23.840
if you two dress less like
tramps and more like
gentlemen of commerce,

49:23.880 --> 49:27.160
the ladies and gentlemen
of China might take us
more seriously.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.920
JEREMY: (MUFFLED)
So we've gotta get changed?

49:28.960 --> 49:30.400
-Sorry.
-Yes.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.960
Sorry, my whole tongue
is wrapped up in intestine.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.920
(SIZZLING AND BUBBLING)

49:39.240 --> 49:41.440
JEREMY: The next morning
we reconvened

49:41.480 --> 49:44.320
after buying ourselves
some business suits.

49:51.440 --> 49:54.160
We're supposed to be
sending out a message
that we're important,

49:54.200 --> 49:56.680
and that people should listen
to what we have to say.

49:56.720 --> 49:59.320
-Now I've done that.
-I think
we are doing that well.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.560
No, I am.
No, you just look like

50:01.600 --> 50:04.480
you've got a sub-machine gun
in a violin case.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.840
-Have you seen James,
by the way, this morning?
-No.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.280
No, I haven't seen
what he's gone for,
but let's be honest...

50:09.320 --> 50:10.560
-Brown.
-Yes.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.080
BOTH: It'll be brown.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.560
-Nothing is more certain
than brown.
-Sombre, severe.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.280
-Yeah.
-It's not brown.

50:17.320 --> 50:19.120
That's not... Ohhh!

50:19.160 --> 50:22.320
JEREMY: (YELLS)
Good morning, Vietnam!

50:22.360 --> 50:24.520
That is bold.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.000
Now don't pretend
you did that on purpose.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.000
-Well, shall I be honest?
BOTH: Yes.

50:29.040 --> 50:32.880
I ordered it using
a translation app
I got for my phone.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.680
And you mistook
green for grey.

50:34.720 --> 50:36.920
I don't know if I did, or
they did, or it doesn't work,

50:36.960 --> 50:39.480
but I said "light, grey",

50:39.520 --> 50:41.520
meaning lightweight, grey.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.960
But I got green.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.560
Yes, and you look ridiculous,

50:44.600 --> 50:47.480
and nobody's going to listen
to a word you say.

50:47.520 --> 50:51.560
The fact is, though,
we were all suited up.

50:51.600 --> 50:55.680
So it was time to get into
the back of our modified cars
and get going.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.520
RICHARD: What's that?
-That's one of
my modifications.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.680
-It's Giovanni.
-No, it's Cato.

51:03.720 --> 51:07.240
See, I ask him for something
and then he passes it
through the ski hatch.

51:08.680 --> 51:11.840
-Absolute genius.
-It's barbarous.

51:11.880 --> 51:16.080
Having agreed
that my manservant
was a brilliant idea,

51:16.120 --> 51:20.680
we introduced ourselves
to our chauffeurs
and then set off.

51:27.440 --> 51:30.360
My driver is
the excellent Mr Hoo.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.160
I wonder
if he's a doctor, actually.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.200
Dr Hoo is not
a particularly tall man,

51:35.240 --> 51:38.480
but nevertheless, the space
in the back of the S Class
is fantastic.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.960
I've got all this leg room,
I can adjust the seat.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I can recline myself a bit.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.720
I can make myself
a bit more upright.
It's quite warm.

51:45.760 --> 51:50.440
The air conditioning
still doesn't work. I should
actually warn Dr Hoo of that.

51:50.480 --> 51:55.160
Doctor, I apologise, the
air conditioning is broken.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.240
(TRANSLATOR APP
SPEAKS CHINESE)

51:57.280 --> 52:00.880
Doctor, the hair in the
college has not been spoken.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.840
Obviously our cars were built
before Bluetooth

52:05.880 --> 52:09.280
and internet connectivity
had been invented.

52:09.320 --> 52:13.720
But that's OK, because
it means you're forced to
spend your time in the back,

52:13.760 --> 52:17.320
doing something interesting.

52:17.360 --> 52:22.120
What I'm gonna do, instead
of watching CNN drone on
about Donald Trump,

52:22.160 --> 52:24.200
or checking on
Nasdaq prices...

52:25.280 --> 52:28.320
...is er...make a model...

52:28.360 --> 52:33.120
a matchstick model
of the Eiffel Tower.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.800
My colleagues had also
decided to make the back seat

52:35.840 --> 52:38.800
a place of learning
and self-enrichment.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.480
I've said many times
on this programme

52:42.520 --> 52:45.320
how I can't cook anything
other than baked beans,

52:45.360 --> 52:47.680
but I'm gonna use
this journey,

52:47.720 --> 52:51.480
together with this simple
stove, this wok,
and these ingredients,

52:51.520 --> 52:54.440
to put that right and learn
how to make supper.

52:54.480 --> 52:59.280
I've got
my cookery book here.

52:59.320 --> 53:02.440
Steamed razor clams with
black beans and chilli sauce.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.080
JAMES: I, meanwhile,
had decided to try
my hand at painting.

53:09.200 --> 53:11.200
Now this is an ideal studio

53:11.240 --> 53:15.000
because I can paint the
things that I'm going to see
out of the window.

53:15.040 --> 53:19.720
Sort of montage, if you like,
of typical roadside sights,

53:19.760 --> 53:22.280
on a chauffeur-journey
through China.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.760
Trees...

53:25.800 --> 53:28.560
Trees right here, there.

53:31.200 --> 53:34.000
(LIT MATCH CRACKLES)

53:34.040 --> 53:35.960
Lovely, lovely.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.960
(CLINKING)

53:39.000 --> 53:40.440
Not now, Cato.

53:40.480 --> 53:43.240
I could be sitting here
now...

53:43.280 --> 53:46.560
...answering pointless emails
from pointless people

53:46.600 --> 53:48.840
with nothing better to do
all day.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.640
Not now, Cato.

53:50.680 --> 53:55.040
But, no...
I'm doing something useful,

53:55.080 --> 53:57.880
something joyous,
something pleasurable.

53:57.920 --> 54:01.400
(TAPPING)

54:01.440 --> 54:04.280
Not now, Ca... No, Cato,
no, that's inappropriate.

54:05.400 --> 54:07.320
-(SIZZLING)
-Oh, yeah.

54:07.360 --> 54:08.840
Oh, yeah.

54:10.040 --> 54:13.480
Watercress.
Bit of that.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.600
Spend enough time on
the motorway in the back
of your luxury car

54:16.640 --> 54:20.040
and you could turn yourself
into a part-time
professional chef.

54:20.080 --> 54:22.680
-We could improv...
-(CLATTERING)

54:22.720 --> 54:24.200
Oh.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.600
JEREMY:
Meanwhile, in the BMW...

54:27.640 --> 54:30.600
Cato, my suit.
My suit jacket.

54:30.640 --> 54:32.360
Cato, fire extinguisher.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.920
Cato, now!

54:33.960 --> 54:35.920
-(WHOOSH OF
FIRE EXTINGUISHER)
-Thank you. Yeah.

54:38.080 --> 54:41.160
After a few more
mostly fire-free miles,

54:41.200 --> 54:43.920
we pulled over
to compare our work.

54:46.160 --> 54:49.120
May we see, James May,
what you have achieved,

54:49.160 --> 54:51.000
instead of doing emails?

54:56.600 --> 54:57.800
Well, it's naive.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.320
If I were your mum or dad,

54:59.360 --> 55:00.960
I'd put that
on the fridge door

55:01.000 --> 55:02.360
and I'd be very proud of you.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.280
This is going
on the wall at home.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.560
Can we taste your soup?

55:06.600 --> 55:08.560
Well,
you'll have to suck my tie.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.280
That's where it all ended up.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.240
Were you expanding your mind
by setting yourself on fire?

55:13.280 --> 55:16.440
-Is that all you've done?
-No, no, no, no, no,
it's matches.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.080
One snapped
and went into my sleeve.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.800
JAMES: You've ruined
that beautiful suit.

55:21.840 --> 55:23.600
-I wanna see
what you've done.
-Let's have a look.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.840
I'm a bit embarrassed by it.

55:24.880 --> 55:27.200
Is it... It's a burnt
wreck, isn't it?

55:27.240 --> 55:28.600
It's not my best work.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.600
This was gonna be
your birthday present,

55:30.640 --> 55:32.760
but now you've said it's
crap you're not having it.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.760
Please don't laugh.

55:35.800 --> 55:38.400
Oh, right.
And you made that, did you?

55:38.440 --> 55:40.880
-Really?
-In the back of your car.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.680
Yeah, I know, but I...
Look... At great cost.

55:43.720 --> 55:45.640
Yeah. Yeah.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.520
JEREMY: For the next leg
of our journey

55:49.560 --> 55:52.880
we tried out
the modifications
we'd made to our cars,

55:52.920 --> 55:58.040
so they'd suit the world
of modern commerce.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.480
Businessmen always want
a flat bed when they're on
an aeroplane,

56:01.520 --> 56:04.920
so why wouldn't you want one
if you're in your car?

56:04.960 --> 56:07.520
Very simple to achieve this.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.880
Recline the front seat,

56:08.920 --> 56:11.720
put a mattress on it,
duvet, pillow.

56:11.760 --> 56:15.480
Take off what's left of
your jacket and into bed.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.920
Oh, it's gone dark.
That's nice.

56:20.800 --> 56:24.400
In the Cadillac, Hammond had
been a little more ambitious.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.680
Name me one businessman hotel
that doesn't have a gym.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.080
Exactly.

56:35.120 --> 56:38.000
They all do, which is why
I've fitted my Cadillac

56:38.040 --> 56:39.840
with this rowing machine.

56:39.880 --> 56:43.400
So as we drive along,
I can get in shape.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.960
Healthy body
means a healthy mind.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.840
-How's life in your car,
Mr Hammond?
-It's brilliant, thank you.

56:48.880 --> 56:52.720
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm just nodding off.

56:52.760 --> 56:55.640
You go in a tunnel, it feels
like night, it's lovely.

56:55.680 --> 56:59.120
Um... Question, though.
What's... What's James done?

56:59.160 --> 57:01.560
I can't see him.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.680
Bit more on the coals.

57:04.760 --> 57:06.680
(SIZZLING)

57:06.720 --> 57:09.720
I realise this now
looks like an idiotic idea.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.880
It was already
a sauna in my car,

57:10.920 --> 57:12.640
so I've built a sauna in it.

57:12.680 --> 57:16.400
But...let's imagine you were
in the far north of China.

57:16.440 --> 57:18.200
Let's imagine
it's the winter.

57:18.240 --> 57:21.680
You can get through
from the other side,
through that door,

57:21.720 --> 57:23.520
-enjoy a sauna...
-(SIZZLING)

57:23.560 --> 57:25.080

into your car,

your oil painting.

57:27.760 --> 57:29.800
Ohh. Ohh.

57:31.520 --> 57:34.680
There was, however, one small
drawback to my plan.

57:34.720 --> 57:38.600
My driver
couldn't see his mirrors.

57:38.640 --> 57:42.480
-(HORN BEEPS)
JAMES: Whoa! Bollocks.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.520
-All right, all right.
-(HORN BEEPS)

57:44.560 --> 57:48.480
God, Dr Hoo's getting
a right strop on. I know,
it's steamed up. Hang on.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.600
-(KNOCKING)
-All right, all right,
all right.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.920
JEREMY:
Oh, that's so nice.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.600
Oh, that's lovely.

57:59.680 --> 58:01.600
That is lovely,
lovely, lovely.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.240
Mm.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.600
Not... Not yet, Cato.

58:15.400 --> 58:20.560
JEREMY: The next morning,
having proved that all cars
need saunas, gyms and beds,

58:20.600 --> 58:22.520
we sacked our chauffeurs

58:22.560 --> 58:25.600
and headed for the location
of our final challenge.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.720
However, in the USS
Norman Schwarzkopf...

58:34.040 --> 58:35.960
-(BLEEP)
-Geschw Grenze?

58:37.240 --> 58:38.840
What does that one mean?

58:38.880 --> 58:40.640
(BLEEP)

58:40.680 --> 58:42.240
It's not well.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.600
(BLEEP)

58:43.640 --> 58:45.280
Oh, that's another...
I don't...

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
I don't know what that
warning says either.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.240
-Oh, God, it's dying.
-(ENGINE KNOCKING)

58:55.720 --> 58:57.640
(STEAM HISSING)

59:03.400 --> 59:05.400
Oh, it's losing oil.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.360
(JEREMY CHUCKLES)

59:09.840 --> 59:12.600
What's happened?

59:12.640 --> 59:17.120
Loads of warnings came on...
and then it lost power.

59:17.160 --> 59:20.480
I made it to this off-ramp
and now it's... it died.

59:20.520 --> 59:21.640
Oh, dear.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.720
I'm not sure my jump leads

59:23.760 --> 59:25.400
are gonna get that going,
are they?

59:25.440 --> 59:26.920
-No.
-Oh, look.

59:26.960 --> 59:29.120
-Oh, dear.
JAMES: That's really
gone bang, hasn't it?

59:29.160 --> 59:32.480
RICHARD: There's oil
coming out everywhere.

59:32.520 --> 59:34.600
Do you know the number for
the emergency services?

59:35.320 --> 59:36.880
No, I don't.

59:36.920 --> 59:39.120
Do you know how to say,
"My Cadillac's broken down"?

59:39.160 --> 59:41.160
-Do you know
what junction you're at?
-No.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.200
-Oh, dear.
-No, neither do I.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.920
-Do you?
-No idea, no.

59:44.960 --> 59:47.160
Come on,
we've got a long way to go.

59:49.600 --> 59:54.400
Leaving the multilingual
Brummie to deal with the
Chinese breakdown services,

59:54.440 --> 59:57.960
James and I got back onto
what is fast becoming...

59:58.000 --> 59:59.920
...the eighth wonder
of the world:

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:07.240
China's road network.

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:16.040
In 1988, China had
no motorways at all.

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:20.800
And now, 30 years later,
it has 84,000 miles of them.

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:24.160
That's more than any other
country in the world.

1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:37.480
And they're only just
getting into their stride.

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:42.800
Since 2011, they've been
building 6,000 miles of
motorway every year.

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.000
6,000 miles a year!

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:51.720
It beggars belief and it's
not like the terrain is easy.

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.520
Here, though, there ain't
no mountain high enough

1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:58.240
and there ain't no valley
low enough, to stop them.

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:03.040
This bridge, for example...

1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.960
...is 34 miles long.

1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:16.400
And then there's this one,
the Duge Beipanjiang Bridge.

1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:19.520
You could fit the London
Shard underneath it...

1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:22.240
...twice over.

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:33.080
I'm telling you.

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:36.160
In Britain, we're doomed.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.720
We're doomed.

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:41.720
We were headed, though,
for an old road,

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.080
to test the one thing
we hadn't tested so far.

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:50.920
And here in China, it's
the most important thing.

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.360
The thing is, luxury's all
very well, but in China,

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:55.960
driving is
a relatively new thing.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.520
People have only been
doing it for 30 years.

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:03.040
And as is the way with all
new things, it should be fun.

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:06.760
Eventually we...

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:10.400
Well, two of us, arrived at
the location we'd selected.

1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:19.200
It's known as
the 24-curve road

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:25.320
because it has
24 fun-filled curves.

1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:30.280
It was built in 1935 to ferry
US military equipment
to China.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:35.480
And it hasn't really
been maintained since.

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:38.560
So the surface is
loose and potholed.

1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:41.240
And it looked like
it should be a right laugh.

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:46.360
This was actually part
of the road that led...

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:50.160
the only road that linked the
then capital of China with
India and Burma.

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.000
Yeah, well, before that,
all the supplies

1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:54.000
that came into China
had to be flown over
the Himalayas,

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.040
which was incredibly
dangerous in the '30s.

1:02:56.080 --> 1:02:58.240
I think the Americans
lost something like 400--

1:02:58.280 --> 1:02:59.720
Sorry... Sorry to interrupt,

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:01.600
have you seen
this stupid thing?

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:05.240
Well, never mind that,
look what he's driving.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.880
What, is that Hammond?

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.240
-I guess the Cadillac's
definitely broken, then.
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:10.880
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.240
Nice!

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:17.480
-Check out my Fulu.
-Why have you got that?

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:20.600
Well I wasn't gonna let you
have all the fun, was I?

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.640
Never mind that,
why have you got it?

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:27.120
My telephone translation
device at the toll booth
worked to a degree,

1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:28.600
to this extent.

1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:30.480
What you...
Somebody got you a car?

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.040
Look, I got wheels,
three of them.

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:35.720
-What engine's it got?
-588cc twin-cylinder
two-stroke.

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:37.040
-(JEREMY INHALES)
-It's in the back.

1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:39.880
Ah, look at that.

1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:42.320
It's actually smaller
than its own air filter.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:45.560
I was gonna say, my
alternator's bigger than
that in the Mercedes.

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:47.600
Anyway, listen.
Here's what we're doing.

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:50.360
-Yeah.
-It's a test of speed.

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:53.040
Cos we are against the clock,
bear that in mind, OK?

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:54.960
And durability,
at the same time.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000
So you've gotta get
up this road,

1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:58.840
which goes all
the way up there,

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:00.440
as fast as possible,

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:03.440
and keep your car
in one piece in the process.

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.240
Richard and I decided
that James

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.200
should volunteer to go first.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.240
Oh.

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:15.120
Oh, you look exactly
like a racing driver,
apart from visually.

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:17.000
It's a racing clown.

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:19.600
Can we just get on with it?
It's very hot in here.

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.280
Going with your window
down or up? Lot of stones.

1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:22.560
Down?

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.400
It's a small risk
from being hit by a stone.

1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:26.880
It's a large risk of
dying from suffocation.

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:29.360
Right. Anything else
we wanna say to him?

1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:30.880
Yes. "Go."

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:32.360
Just take some time
and prepare mentally,

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:34.240
and really think about this.

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:36.160
-Have you visualised
the course?
-No.

1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:38.680
RICHARD: OK.

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.960
JEREMY: He looks quite cross.
RICHARD: He does, yeah.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000
-Three, two, one, go!
-There you go.

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:44.480
Push.

1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:48.520
Oh ,God, I can't...

1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:51.360
I can't see round
right-hand bends because
of my sauna.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:56.560
Whoa!

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.920
Massive hole there.

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:01.640
I've just realised that
I've only been comfortable

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:04.040
for 20 minutes
of this entire trip.

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:07.040
My car's been too hot,
my suit's too hot,

1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:08.840
now the road's too rough.

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:18.720
Bit of squirrelling there
from the broken traction
control.

1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:26.160
The finish line!

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:27.280
I've done it!

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:34.480
JEREMY: Next, it was my turn.

1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:39.320
Right, I'm attaching the
wobbly-headed symbol
of Capitalism here,

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:41.880
to bring me good fortune
on this perilous test.

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.000
-If you're ready.
-Yes.

1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:47.960
Five, four, three...
(LAUGHS)

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:51.160
...two, one.

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:52.880
Go!

1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:03.360
Now, I'm guessing James May
will have gone for caution.

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:05.120
I'm not going to.

1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:08.440
Cos I'm going
for speed and power.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:13.040
And then just trust
in the BMW build quality.

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:19.000
My wobbly-headed symbol
of Capitalism is wilting.

1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:22.240
It's not... Arrrgh!

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:24.880
Jesus, that was
a big tail slide there!

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.520
Oh, yeah.

1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:31.600
Stick it in here. Oh, yes.

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:36.520
-(RATTLING)
-Oh, what's happened?

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:42.840
(RATTLING AND CLANKING)

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.240
Yeah.

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:54.720
-You overdid it, didn't you?
-Yeah.

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:57.240
JAMES: So I've won that.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:59.280
Well, we don't know.
We haven't got your time yet.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:03.400
You said - your words: "Test
of durability and is against
the clock."

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:05.440
Your car is broken.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:08.920
-It's not broken,
a tyre's come off.
-It's broken.

1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:10.800
RICHARD:
Down at the start line,

1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:12.720
I was waiting
for the signal to go.

1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:17.240
Hm. Little cubby hole.

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:19.000
JEREMY: Richard Hammond.

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.800
Hello, yes.

1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:25.240
JEREMY: Three, two, one, go!
-Oh, come on, I'm not...

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:27.080
Right, OK, here I go.

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:28.680
(ENGINE REVS)

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.280
And we're off.

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:32.040
Oh, Christ! Oh.

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:35.520
I am limited on power.

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.520
Top speed: 39 miles an hour.

1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:41.840
Ow, ow!

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:44.600
We're never gonna get an air
ambulance in here, are we?

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.560
Well, he might
have a very long winch.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:53.840
Ohhh!

1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:55.680
Big drops, I don't like that.
Ow!

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.080
Nervous of hill
climbs these days.

1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:02.560
Agh, oh.

1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.640
A line, use my line.

1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:07.320
Ow.

1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:08.480
Oh, my God!

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:11.080
Oh, dear!

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:12.800
Oh, God!

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:22.960
-Did anyone s...
-Was that...

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.760
-Did he just crash it?
-Was that a crash or did he
just disappear behind the...

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.720
He has, look,
he's gone off there.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.400
Er...so there we are,

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:36.880
I'm afraid that
Richard Hammond's luck
has finally run out.

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.720
And it's with deep regret,
and great sadness,

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.600
that James and I
must now announce
the untimely demise of...

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.560
RICHARD: I'm all right.

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:49.360
-Not again.
-How's he do it?

1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:51.400
I don't know.

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.040
Well, on that terrible
disappointment,

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:54.760
back to the tent.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.760
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:02.600
-Look at my face.
-I'm OK. I'm OK.

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:04.040
JEREMY: Smug face.
-I'm fine.

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.440
-Don't worry.
-Smug.

1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:11.080
Smug because I won that.

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:13.800
-No, you didn't.
-I did, I was the fastest.

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.560
And it was supposed to be a
test of fun and you moaned
the entire way up the hill.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:22.160
It was a test of durability.
You had to change a wheel
and where's the fun in that?

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.920
Well, I wasn't the idiot that
put a sauna in my car.

1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:26.360
What's wrong with a sauna?

1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:28.800
Because in every hotel
that's got a sauna,

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:31.760
the corridors are
always full of wet idiots

1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:33.640
with those slippers
that don't fit.

1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.560
-Hello? Hello?
-What?

1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:39.000
I did have quite a big crash
at the end there. I thought--

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:40.800
There's nothing particularly
remarkable about that,
is there?

1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:42.040
I mean, why would you...

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:44.000
The fact is,
the reason you crashed...

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:46.000
Well, obviously
you're incompetent.

1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:51.680
But also because your
Cadillac broke down and
your Mercedes was too humid.

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:54.720
So that means
the winner is definitely,
of the whole thing,

1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:57.440
the BMW 750i.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:59.360
-What?
-Actually, no.

1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:02.800
To be fair, the real winner
of the whole thing was
our brilliant idea

1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:05.720
to sell second-hand limos
to the Chinese.

1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:07.280
No, he's absolutely right
about that,

1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:08.960
because it makes them happy

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.120
and it helps us with
our balance of payments.

1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:13.160
-Everybody wins.
-It was a good idea.

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:15.200
-Yes.
-Except for one tiny detail.

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:20.280
You see, this programme
is shown in every single
country in the world.

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:21.800
Except one.

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:24.400
(LAUGHTER)

1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:26.080
-Which one?
-China.

1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:27.680
Ah.

1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:31.080
So this entire show has been
a total waste of time.

1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:35.200
It's an hour of your life
you'll never get back.

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.320
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:40.040
Next week, I'm happy to say,
we're back in the groove.

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:43.400
We're in Scotland and I get
an Alfa Romeo GTV6,
make me very happy.

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.320
See you then, take care.
Good night.

1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.280
-Good night.
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
