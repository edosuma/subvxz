00:02.200 --> 00:03.725
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.920 --> 00:05.843
<i>You're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:08.087
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.526
It's the fault of only one man.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.767
<i>And we're going to stop him.</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:12.161
Do you remember what I promised you?

00:12.400 --> 00:13.367
A new beginning.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.686
And you will have it.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.925
<i>I've seen
what he can do with his powers.</i>

00:18.200 --> 00:19.850
<i>But when he tried to use them on me,</i>

00:20.080 --> 00:21.605
<i>it completely backfired.</i>

00:21.840 --> 00:23.604
<i>And my bloodlust was gone.</i>

00:23.760 --> 00:26.604
Help me figure out a way
to make that permanent.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.967
One day, I will have my moment,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.201
and I will kill you.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.526
Take her!

01:02.720 --> 01:04.084
Take that away as well.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.006
The food attracts flies,
and I prefer my solitude.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.405
The pepper came from the garden.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.924
The garden grows strong,
even in your absence.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.490
Please try a bite.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.800
The mountain will be ours by morning.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.161
We must act quickly.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.528
The Usurper will return,
and with him, his followers.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.687
Has the Lotus been found?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.644
In Kyushu. It's well-guarded.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.764
So was this place upon a time.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.201
Good news is that the burglar
is headed straight toward you.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.880
Bad news is that the burglar
is headed straight towards you.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.441
Freeze!

02:40.840 --> 02:42.001
Where'd he learn to do that?

02:42.200 --> 02:43.611
I'm thinking Cirque du Soleil.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.767
He's headed for the roof.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.406
Thank you, Black Canary.
That is your cue, Green Arrow and Speedy.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.722
- Is she...
- Overusing our code names?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.445
Yeah. Indulge her.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.971
We got him, Overwatch.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.169
You have no idea
how much I love hearing that.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.811
<i>I think we do, actually.</i>

02:57.440 --> 02:58.407
<i>Two rooftop doors.</i>

02:58.600 --> 03:00.443
Floor plans show that the staircase
splits a level below you.

03:00.840 --> 03:01.966
He could come out either door.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.846
Got him.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.926
Speedy!

03:55.680 --> 03:56.727
FELICITYI How's Thea?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.042
She's okay.
She's resting at our place.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.401
She said it was just exhaustion.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.886
We don't believe a word of that, do we?

04:03.080 --> 04:04.081
What else could it be?

04:05.680 --> 04:06.681
The Pit.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.887
The bloodlust makes her feral,
it doesn't make her lose consciousness.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.287
- And Thea hasn't gone aggro in months.
- Exactly.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.567
Maybe this is some sort of side-effect

04:14.760 --> 04:15.966
of her white-knuckling her way through it.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.571
It still seems like a bit of a leap.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.526
Ollie, what are you thinking?

04:21.399 --> 04:23.528
That I should have done a betterjob
of keeping an eye on her.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.566
She told me the bloodlust came back
two months ago and I didn't even know.

04:27.760 --> 04:31.048
I've been focused on the campaign,
and I've been...

04:31.240 --> 04:34.562
Running back and forth
to Central City and...

04:36.080 --> 04:39.084
How is it that you always manage to
blame yourself for everything?

04:39.360 --> 04:41.522
That's his superpower. Guilt Arrow.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.368
Did our thief steal anything else
from AmerTek?

04:44.560 --> 04:45.561
A network mapper.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.404
A piece of tech designed to scan

04:47.640 --> 04:50.723
all nearby digital infrastructure
for potential vulnerabilities.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.046
Do we think it's his last score?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.605
We better hope that it is.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.731
AmerTek's one of the last
viable businesses left in Star City.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.400
Turns out, Palmer Tech is
one of those "viable businesses."

04:59.600 --> 05:01.090
For now, at least.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.446
What do you mean, "For now?"

05:02.640 --> 05:04.130
The board, in their infinite wisdom,

05:04.360 --> 05:05.691
decided to move the presentation of

05:05.880 --> 05:08.326
Curtis' world-changing tech
from April to now.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.330
And guess who gets to be the
face of that potential disaster?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.967
Oh, well, do you want me to come with you?
A little moral support.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.766
- No. I'll be fine. It's just a dry run.
- Okay.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.244
<i>Uh, in the past 30 years,</i>

05:23.440 --> 05:26.523
<i>battery technology has been
at a virtual standstill,</i>

05:26.760 --> 05:31.402
<i>with batteries lasting no longer than
they did in the 19703...</i>

05:33.440 --> 05:34.726
Damn it.

05:38.600 --> 05:43.640
<i>But Palmer Tech's Power Cell</i>

05:44.000 --> 05:46.082
<i>represents</i> a <i>major breakthrough...</i>

05:47.720 --> 05:50.803
Sorry. I should've gone with
overhead projector.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.601
Mr. Holt, could you give us
the room, please?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.165
Well, actually, that's gonna be
a little difficult

05:57.360 --> 05:59.362
seeing as how the entire building's
a property of...

06:02.160 --> 06:03.650
I just... I'll be right outside.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.761
Sorry.

06:08.840 --> 06:09.966
- Felicity.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.209
May I be uncomfortably honest?

06:12.640 --> 06:16.281
Well, you have never shown
an inability to do so before.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.521
Right.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.121
This company has been
flirting with bankruptcy

06:21.320 --> 06:22.970
since before you returned to Star City.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.844
And your injury...

06:25.200 --> 06:27.680
Well, it didn't exactly help
our stock price.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.606
We stake the future of Palmer Tech
on this Power Cell.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.609
We need to put our best foot forward.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.645
Well, that is not something
I'm exactly able to do right now.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.201
- But...
- Sorry.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.846
Poor choice of words.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.760
What I mean is...

06:41.000 --> 06:44.686
Perhaps it'd be better to let someone else
do this presentation.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.727
And by "someone else,"
you mean someone not in a wheelchair.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.527
This is about doing
what's best for the company.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.560
Anything less than a perfect launch
and we are sunk.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.650
Right. You're right.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.806
Please let the board know.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.287
Hey-

07:19.240 --> 07:22.449
Just wanted to check in,
see how you were doing.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.564
Why, I'd think the answer to
that question is fairly self-evident.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.048
Thea's bloodlust is
the balancing of an equation.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.129
She was given life
and now she needs to take it.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.402
Malcolm, we know that already.
What we don't know is why...

07:33.640 --> 07:34.766
What you don't know.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.930
What I didn't know until Thea collapsed

07:38.120 --> 07:42.125
is that, if the life she
owes doesn't come from taking others,

07:42.320 --> 07:44.322
it will come from the life of the host.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.564
Please do not refer to me as "the host."

07:47.760 --> 07:48.886
This isn't a joke.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.086
If you don't indulge this bloodlust,
you will die.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.402
I don't understand. Sara wasn't like this.

07:54.600 --> 07:59.083
John Constantine made Sara whole
and restored the balance.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.324
Thea, I thought you were doing okay.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.410
Because the bloodlust was
temporarily blunted.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.727
By What?

08:08.440 --> 08:09.601
Damien Darhk.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.962
When we rescued Andy from HIVE,
Iran into him.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.603
He tried to kill me
with his magic death touch thingy,

08:18.800 --> 08:20.928
but it didn't work on me.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.963
What it did do was stop the bloodlust.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.650
For a time.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.921
We need to find Damien Darhk,

08:26.120 --> 08:27.645
and make whatever he did to her permanent.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.251
Oliver,
even if that were possible,

08:29.480 --> 08:32.289
even if you caught Damien
in a more cooperative mood,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.289
he and his HIVE have gone to ground.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.845
Or haven't you noticed?

08:38.960 --> 08:40.041
- Yeah.
- Our sticky-fingered friend

08:40.240 --> 08:41.765
just pulled anotherjob at Cadmus Tech.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.604
He's two blocks east of you, headed south.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.761
John, I can't right now.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.206
He stole a weapon this time.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.726
Just go.
Nothing is gonna change here in an hour.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.087
I'm on my way.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.561
Where am I looking?

08:55.800 --> 08:57.211
<i>We're working on it.</i>

08:57.480 --> 08:59.005
Got him!

09:58.360 --> 09:59.486
Roy?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.850
First Sara, then Ray,
then John's brother...

10:13.040 --> 10:15.202
Whose shocking return
can we look forward to next?

10:15.400 --> 10:17.164
Oliver, I'm gonna ask this just to ask it.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.890
- Are you sure that it was...
- It was Roy. Absolutely.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.286
Or maybe it was just somebody

10:22.480 --> 10:24.369
who's able to
make themselves look like Roy.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.284
Don't act like
it's the craziest possibility

10:27.520 --> 10:29.045
after everything that we've experienced.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.050
What's "crazy" is Roy stealing
from tech companies.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.321
What did he take this time?

10:33.520 --> 10:36.888
Triode capacitor bomb.
Tiny device, really huge boom.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.250
It's Alex for the 500th time today.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.281
OLIVER; Hey.

10:48.760 --> 10:49.966
Hey, I was just texting you.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.563
- How did you not...
- Oh.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.041
- Campaign office has a secret elevator.
- What?

10:55.560 --> 10:58.723
I'm kidding.
I came in the side to avoid the media.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.046
Got your nine-one-one.
Everything all right?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.241
No. Not really.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.647
Ledger's going to press with it tomorrow,
but we got a heads up.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.251
Someone else is
throwing their hat in the ring.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.250
- Who?
- Political novice, it looks like.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.562
Still working up a bio,
but she seems to have come out of nowhere

11:10.760 --> 11:13.366
to suddenly have a campaign office
in Pennytown.

11:14.000 --> 11:14.967
Ruvé Adams.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.208
Do you know her from somewhere?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.801
No. I'm just surprised
to have an opponent.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.047
Yeah.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.163
Well, it's pretty much a game-changer.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.761
Yes, it is.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.481
I've never doubted
your resiliency, Mr. Queen.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.960
But you will tell me.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.365
Why did you need these maps?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.642
He can't tell you anything
if you kill him!

11:52.840 --> 11:54.126
Get her out of here!

11:55.920 --> 11:57.410
No!

12:04.360 --> 12:05.885
What did your tattoos reveal, hmm?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.325
What were you trying to find?

12:27.840 --> 12:29.001
Hello, Oliver.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.170
It's good to see you again.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.850
Are you here to endorse me?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.610
I want a meeting with your husband.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.526
I'm not sure you would survive
another "meeting" with my husband.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.125
No fight this time.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.490
I have a proposition for him.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.886
I'm listening.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.562
Tomorrow, 10:30. Kershaw and Eighth.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.809
Uh, we have a new problem.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.010
I was going over the schematics
of the two pieces of stolen tech,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.202
trying to figure out
where Roy was going to hit next...

13:09.400 --> 13:10.367
Any luck?

13:10.600 --> 13:11.840
No, I mean not at first.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.407
A capacitor bomb and a network mapper,
that's like...

13:14.640 --> 13:16.005
Ceiling fan and broccoli.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.521
- Sounds like a messy combination.
- Combination being the breakthrough.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.451
I stopped trying to figure out
what the two pieces of tech had in common

13:21.640 --> 13:24.166
and started working on what would happen
if they were combined somehow.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.526
Their components, specifically.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.687
Tell us something good.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.245
It depends on your definition of "good."

13:28.440 --> 13:30.727
But I'm pretty sure that
AmerTek's network mapper

13:30.920 --> 13:34.447
and Cadmus' capacitor could theoretically
be used to create a web-nuke.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.081
Like a bomb?

13:36.280 --> 13:37.247
Roy already stole a bomb.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.364
No, lam talking about a device
that can destroy the entire Internet.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.042
We're talking banking systems,
nuclear arsenals, power grids...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.402
Last year,
Roy could barely spell computer.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.889
Even assuming
he did build this device, I...

13:49.080 --> 13:50.889
- Why hasn't he used it?
- Because it's incomplete.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.004
A device like this needs a really
substantial power source to run off of.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.730
And guess what company in Star City

13:56.920 --> 13:59.446
just invented the next generation
revolutionary battery?

14:06.440 --> 14:07.407
I don't wanna hurt you.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.647
I don't want you to hurt me either.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.080
Well, I'm gonna need to take that.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.287
Oh...

14:11.480 --> 14:12.845
I think you might have to hurt me, then.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.330
Roy, stand down.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.131
There's something wrong with him.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.731
Yeah, I think that's been established.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.251
Let's talk about this, Roy.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.880
<i>Drone is in position.</i>

14:58.200 --> 15:00.089
Roy. Roy, what are you doing?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.371
Listen very carefully.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.808
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Do it.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.006
No, wait!

15:14.680 --> 15:16.011
What did you do?

15:31.400 --> 15:33.846
Take out the tranq, carefully.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.328
Let's hope the Faraday cage
Cisco installed in here works.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.646
A what?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.601
Basically a shield for everything
broadcast and electromagnetic.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.962
- Which eye did you see the tech in?
- The right one.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.846
How'd you even know he had it?

15:48.040 --> 15:49.007
Roy's eyes are blue.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.009
I'm guessing this was transmitting
an AV signal,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.725
probably to
whoever was picking up the tech.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.445
Well, he can tell us when he wakes up.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.761
- Where am I?
- It's okay.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.568
We took out the contact. We made it
look like we killed you. You're safe.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.410
While I'm in here, at least.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.442
New lair. Nice.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.123
I heard about what happened. I'm sorry.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.484
Roy, what happened to you?

16:22.840 --> 16:24.001
I got made.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.404
I was in Hub City.
A new life, new name. Everything.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.365
- And then I got an e-mail.
- Saying, what?

16:29.560 --> 16:30.846
Steal a bunch of stuff?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.610
Or he'll expose me as Roy Harper.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.401
Suddenly, the Arrow's not dead anymore.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.171
And then the police,
they'd be looking at you. Again.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.361
Who's the blackmailer?

16:38.600 --> 16:42.002
I don't know. I've never met him.
But he calls himself The Calculator.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.567
This is what happens
when the bad guys name themselves.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.081
- Roy, you should've come to us sooner.
- I couldn't.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.129
He's right.
There's a camera built into this.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.441
This is really incredible tech.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.246
He could see every single move I made,
every person I talk to.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.680
I couldn't just expose you guys like that.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.325
We would've figured something out.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.602
- This is my problem.
- 'Cause you were solving my problem.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.404
<i>Okay, well our problem is that</i>

17:00.600 --> 17:03.683
The Calculator now has everything he needs
to melt the Internet.

17:03.880 --> 17:04.847
I love the Internet.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.242
Which means we have to find him. Fast.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.410
Can you back-trace the components
and figure out where that broadcasts to?

17:10.599 --> 17:12.887
- Girl, you read my mind.
- Pop yourjacket off, I'll patch you up.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.844
Man, I cannot believe you shot me.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.921
Really?

17:24.079 --> 17:25.127
Mei?

17:25.480 --> 17:26.481
<i>Shade.</i>

17:29.040 --> 17:30.121
Shado's dead.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.530
I know. You're having a vision.
The result of your injuries.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.886
You're not real?

17:42.360 --> 17:43.361
No.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.444
But what I've come to tell you is.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.450
What have you come to tell me?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.562
You need to forgive yourself
for what you've done.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.761
Unfortunately, you're gonna
have to be a little bit more specific.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.931
You had the chance to leave this island,
to return to your family.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.804
They miss you terribly.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.611
Can't go back to my family.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.971
Not the way that I am now.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.170
Then it's time to start changing.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.690
The only way out is through, Oliver.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.688
That's what Amanda Waller said.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.486
Through what?

18:25.720 --> 18:29.327
Through your own darkness. Let it go.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.640
I don't know how.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.560
Then I will teach you.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.527
This is it.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.321
- I see no shrine.
- The woods are the shrine, Talibah.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.082
In times long past, the people of Japan
found their gods in all things.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.050
Nature was their temple.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.681
I must do this alone.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.122
If I do not return within the hour,
tell the others...

19:14.000 --> 19:15.331
The war is over.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.401
Hello, Tatsu.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.881
You look well.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.161
Being a member of the Crescent Order
clearly suits you.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.165
I have found my purpose.
What is yours in Japan?

19:55.320 --> 19:56.731
I've come for the Lotus.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.880
It is my responsibility to keep it safe.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.921
I know.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.520
Unfortunate.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.131
We're evenly matched.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.123
One of us must yield,
or this will go on for ages.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.805
I have nowhere else to be.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.641
I do.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.087
In a matter that concerns Oliver Queen.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.040
I see two options.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.086
We keep fighting
until one of us drops from exhaustion.

20:53.600 --> 20:58.481
Or we lay down our swords,
and you listen to what I have to say.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.328
Maybe next time, we can
do something that doesn't involve

21:04.520 --> 21:06.841
me getting stabbed or shot at.
Justanidea.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.290
I'm sorry that I put you in this position.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.443
I'm pretty sure I put myself
in this position.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.607
Man...

21:13.800 --> 21:14.801
I remember you not being all that happy

21:15.040 --> 21:16.485
that I faked my death
to protect your secret.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.920
I never should have let you.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.005
Do you ever get tired?

21:20.280 --> 21:21.247
You know carrying the weight of the world

21:21.440 --> 21:22.487
on your shoulders like that all the time?

21:22.680 --> 21:24.091
You sound like Felicity.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.726
And Diggle.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.166
Well, great minds.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.603
So what are Felicity and John saying
you're taking responsibility for now?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.601
Thea?

21:38.720 --> 21:39.801
Oh, my God.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.210
Am I hallucinating?

21:44.840 --> 21:46.001
It's really you.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.726
How are you?

21:50.280 --> 21:51.611
I've been better. Um...

21:53.080 --> 21:54.206
How are you?

21:54.800 --> 21:56.211
Where have you been?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.204
What are you doing here?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.407
How long are you... Here...

22:04.280 --> 22:07.443
(Thea“.Thea! 4COUGHWG)

22:07.800 --> 22:10.201
What's happening?

22:10.400 --> 22:12.368
I don't... I don't know.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.370
- Oh, my God...
- it's the wound. From Ra's.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.807
- I'll call nine-one-one.
- No, doctors can't help her.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.170
Stay with us, Thea. Stay strong.
Give it a minute. It will pass.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.166
You're okay.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.241
<i>How's it going?</i>

22:43.560 --> 22:46.530
This tiny piece of plastic
has more computing power in it

22:46.760 --> 22:47.841
than most high-end laptops.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.441
I have half a mind to
reverse engineer it for Palmer Tech.

22:50.760 --> 22:51.727
But first...

22:51.920 --> 22:54.969
Yes, I found a tiny flaw in the O.S. code

22:55.160 --> 22:56.889
and I'm pretty sure I can exploit it to

22:57.080 --> 22:59.651
open a back door
into his main computer system.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.763
Right, but wouldn't that
risk exposing us?

23:03.400 --> 23:06.529
My pride that you understood
what I was saying is slightly undercut

23:06.720 --> 23:08.085
by your lack of faith in me.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.881
I have nothing but faith. Just do it.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.566
I already did.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.761
<i>Well, Well...</i>

23:15.760 --> 23:18.843
Whoever you are, let me just say,
I am very impressed.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.289
<i>No one's ever been able to break through
my encryption before.</i>

23:22.480 --> 23:23.686
Bravo.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.126
Disguise your voice.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.887
Thanks.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.127
<i>I would take that
as</i> a <i>compliment</i>

23:30.320 --> 23:33.449
<i>if it wasn't coming from some nut-job
who's trying to destroy the Internet.</i>

23:33.720 --> 23:35.609
Why would I want to take down the 'net?

23:36.360 --> 23:40.331
Not only is it where I work,
I'm addicted to funny cat videos.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.688
Well, if you're not trying to
take down the Internet,

23:42.880 --> 23:44.450
what do you need a web-nuke for?

23:44.760 --> 23:47.684
<i>Very clever.
Keeping me talking to buy you time to</i>

23:47.840 --> 23:49.649
breach my firewall.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.606
<i>So that's a pass on telling me
your evil plan?</i>

23:52.800 --> 23:54.245
Let's put it this way.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.644
If you wanna make a statement,
you don't take down the system.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.802
You take down a city.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.209
Damn it! He shut me out.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.243
Not before indicating
what his plan might be.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.688
How do you take down a...

24:15.120 --> 24:16.804
Oh, no...

24:17.000 --> 24:17.967
What?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.731
Well, I've been thinking
about what would happen

24:20.920 --> 24:22.843
if he used the web-nuke
to take down the Internet,

24:23.040 --> 24:24.849
but if you used it right...

24:26.160 --> 24:28.561
Overloading the electrical grid,
shutting down hospital equipment,

24:28.760 --> 24:30.410
causing water main breaks...

24:31.000 --> 24:34.402
He... He could kill everyone in the city.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.807
So a web-nuke needs to be
deployed somewhere...

24:46.160 --> 24:48.003
We need to know
where The Calculator wants to install it.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.929
I am not calling him that on principle.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.009
Because it is a lame codename.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.486
Okay, Felicity,
but we still have to check...

24:53.720 --> 24:56.485
I am conducting a review of all the nodes,
sub-nodes, and network access points

24:56.720 --> 24:59.564
where the web-nuke
would do the most damage.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.609
- Any luck?
- Why do you always ask me that?

25:02.800 --> 25:04.290
If I had any luck looking for
what I'm looking for,

25:04.520 --> 25:06.761
I would be telling you about it
instead of looking for it!

25:08.200 --> 25:10.248
Sorry. Stressed.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.121
In addition to our lunatic of the week,
I have Palmer Tech to look after.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.881
Palmer Tech. Ray worked up something
last year called a battering ram,

25:20.120 --> 25:22.043
basically something that could crash
through cyber security.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.480
No commercial application, but...

25:23.680 --> 25:25.808
Can you use it to get back
into The Calculator's system?

25:26.040 --> 25:27.929
Stop calling him that. I'm serious.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.444
Your darkness is guilt.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.884
You've taken many lives.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.406
The life of your love's brother
most recently.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.848
I'm not in love with Taiana.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.286
She helped you recover the maps
from the Amazo,

25:50.520 --> 25:52.363
she nursed you back to health

25:52.560 --> 25:56.884
and all she's received from you in return
is a lie.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.886
Open your eyes.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.126
What's this?

26:13.600 --> 26:16.080
Curtis Holt,
have you seen the battering ram?

26:16.280 --> 26:19.966
It's this kickass piece of tech
that Ray invented last year.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.083
Um, cylindrical shape, titanium shell.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.408
- I'm gearing up for a brute force attack.
- Look out for that...

26:24.640 --> 26:27.166
And I need all the firepower I can muster.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.931
Stool... Uh, never mind.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.244
Hey, you've gotten pretty slick
on that thing in the last 24 hours.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.447
What happened?

26:33.640 --> 26:35.881
Yes! I got it.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.209
- Thanks, Curtis. You're the best.
- I <i>didn't</i> do anything.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.767
You're the one who's whipping around here
like a house on fire.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.531
Well, that is what happens
when the entire city is at stake.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.087
But not when it's just, say,
an entire company.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.930
Mr. Dennis says you're no longer
presenting the Power Cell to the Board?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.565
Well, my dry run was an epic disaster.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.689
Yeah. I know, it was.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.201
It was a spectacular failure.
Like, it was really bad.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.243
- Okay.
- But it wouldn't have been

27:01.440 --> 27:02.771
if this Felicity had come in.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.769
You know, the one who wheels in here,

27:04.960 --> 27:06.962
kicking ass and taking names
like you just did.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.366
No, this is different.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.330
No, it's not.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.449
There's two Felicitys, Felicity.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.042
The one in that boardroom,
whose wheelchair makes her doubt herself.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.406
And this Felicity.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.241
Brilliant force of nature.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.566
This company needs the second Felicity.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.640
Hey-

27:33.080 --> 27:34.445
Laurel told me.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.561
You Okay?

27:37.920 --> 27:39.570
I'm feeling a bit better.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.003
Hey, I'm working on something.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.130
If it's a pedophile for me to kill,

27:45.320 --> 27:48.767
Malcolm's already been
pitching that one hard.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.285
You're not a killer, Thea.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.965
That's not a way for you to live.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.241
But it sounds like Damien Darhk might be.

27:56.600 --> 28:01.640
Yeah, I'm sure
he's just itching to do us a favor.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.002
We're gonna find out.
I arranged a meeting.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.964
It's not like he's gonna be
willing to help me.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.770
Maybe there's something that he wants.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.811
- Something I can trade him.
- Ollie, that's insane.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.963
Not to mention stupid. I...

28:18.880 --> 28:21.451
I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.608
And I can't let you die.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.361
I won't.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.487
That's not up to you.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.568
Look, I know how you take everything on,
everyone's problems.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.521
It's one of the things
I love the most about you.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.724
But you can't fix this one, Ollie.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.481
I have to try.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.721
<i>No, you don't.</i>

28:48.640 --> 28:50.051
It's my choice.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.731
It's my life.

29:00.880 --> 29:01.927
She's stubborn, isn't she?

29:03.840 --> 29:05.683
Definitely something she gets
from your side of the family.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.847
It doesn't matter.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.726
Because you're going to go,
hood in hand, to Damien Darhk?

29:12.520 --> 29:13.760
I am the Demon's Head.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.240
<i>I have my resources.</i>

29:15.720 --> 29:18.007
And I know how to put my ear
up against a door.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.605
Leaving the epic stupidity
of your plan aside...

29:24.920 --> 29:25.921
Thea's right.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.044
This isn't either of our decisions.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.888
Malcolm, do you want her to die?

29:32.120 --> 29:33.246
<i>Of course not.</i>

29:34.240 --> 29:36.561
Do you have any idea how badly
I wanna put a knife in her hand

29:36.760 --> 29:38.444
and force her to slit someone's throat?

29:39.760 --> 29:42.604
I've come this close to dragging someone
in here for her to kill.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.046
<i>And the reason I don't</i>

29:44.200 --> 29:47.761
is because that would be about
my feelings and not Thea's.

29:49.080 --> 29:53.961
Oliver, sometimes the greatest act of love
is no action at all.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.442
<i>It's her life. It's her choice.</i>

30:00.400 --> 30:03.609
This almost feels like cheating,
using Ray's tech to beat this guy.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.243
Got it. He's installing the web-nuke
at Flint Hill's Data Farm.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.084
- Installing?
- Yeah. He's doing it right now.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.651
Get Oliver.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.481
<i>Device is onsite.</i>

30:51.680 --> 30:52.920
Dandy.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.521
Hang on a sec...

31:00.760 --> 31:01.886
Miss me?

31:22.800 --> 31:24.290
I have seriously missed this.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.481
Overwatch, we're on station.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.647
<i>I'm trying to find the web-nuke,</i>

31:26.840 --> 31:29.491
but our adversary knows I'm in his system
and he's trying to kick me out.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.125
I did get a look at his protocols, though,

31:31.320 --> 31:33.971
and if the web-nuke goes online,
he could kill 8,000 people.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.884
<i>I'd say that's a conservative estimate.</i>

31:36.160 --> 31:38.527
Blowing the gas mains alone
will kill 3,000.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.246
Just wait till you see what I've got
planned for the subway cars...

31:41.520 --> 31:43.921
Ooh, good story. Write me a letter.
From prison.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.531
<i>The battering ram was a neat trick.</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:49.202
But the only way you're going to stop me
is by removing the web-nuke on site.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.843
And I suspect that you don't come out
from behind that keyboard much.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.843
That's what I have friends for.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.526
Okay, so does anyone know
how to disconnect this thing?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.047
I brought friends too.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.446
<i>Hired mercenaries.</i>

32:07.680 --> 32:10.001
It's amazing who you can find
on the Dark Web.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.243
Always gotta make an entrance, don't you?

32:24.440 --> 32:27.046
Sorry. It was a meeting
that I decided not to go to.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.120
Look,
I know it's been a while for me,

32:30.360 --> 32:31.725
but this still isn't a good thing, right?

32:31.920 --> 32:34.048
You know, I almost feel bad
about beating you.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.885
Rarely do I get to meet someone
with your talents.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.451
What did you do?

32:43.640 --> 32:46.803
Boom! I believe the technical term
is I pwned you.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.441
Be that as it may,
I can breach through the firewall faster

32:49.640 --> 32:52.769
than I can remove the DRMs
off a Beatles tune.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.610
Guys, the web-nuke is hard-wired in.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.451
Not to get too inside baseball on you,
but I need you to blow the thing up.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.766
How much time do we have?

32:58.960 --> 33:01.930
It's a long story, but somewhere between
<i>I</i> Want To Hold Your <i>Hand</i> and Hey Jude.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.925
Priming the explosive.
Something's not working...

33:05.120 --> 33:06.485
He's jamming the detonation frequencies.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.121
Okay. We do this the old fashioned way
and manually set the charge.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.402
Yeah, but how do we do that
and get out of here in one piece?

33:11.560 --> 33:12.925
Someone has to stay behind.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.081
I'll do it.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.925
Even if you trigger the C4 with an arrow
at a distance,

33:17.120 --> 33:18.690
you still need to outrun the blast radius.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.445
- I can do that.
- Yeah, just because you're wearing red

33:20.680 --> 33:21.681
doesn't make you the Flash, Roy.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.126
I didn't say it wasn't gonna be risky.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.847
You just got a fresh start.
I don't want you to throw it all away.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.128
I'm the one who brought this maniac
into your lives.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.762
I need to do this.
This is my choice. It's my life.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.441
Okay.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.691
See you outside, kid.

33:40.840 --> 33:41.841
Good luck.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.521
Hey-

33:46.440 --> 33:47.771
You run like hell.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.966
Yeah.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.726
You guys might wanna get out of here.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.727
Come on, Roy. Come on!

34:39.679 --> 34:41.091
Just like riding a bicycle.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.688
It's good to have you back, Roy.
You've been missed.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.600
Oh, don't get too used to me.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.684
And I'm gonna have to
go underground again.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.208
Even deeper
now that The Calculator knows who I am.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.044
What's to keep him
from posting it on the Internet?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.248
Oh, I might've installed
a virus in his system

35:03.440 --> 35:05.249
that wiped out everything he had on Roy.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.206
I'm sorry I can't stay.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.411
Not just for you guys, but for Thea.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.761
She'll understand.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.530
She's gonna be okay, Oliver.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.764
Well, whatever she decides,

35:18.120 --> 35:19.360
I'm gonna back her play.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.970
Thank God.
I thought the fever would never break.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.884
- I'll get you some water.
- Taiana.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.562
I need to tell you something.

35:43.880 --> 35:44.961
It's okay.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.484
Whatever it is, it can wait
until you've had some water.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.767
I lied to you.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.961
When I said that Conklin
killed your brother, that was a lie.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.327
I don't understand.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.767
I have this darkness inside of me

36:03.080 --> 36:05.924
that I've been trying to escape
for the longest time.

36:06.760 --> 36:11.163
And I think that I found a way
but first I need to earn your forgiveness.

36:11.760 --> 36:12.841
For what?

36:13.520 --> 36:15.602
I didn't know that Vlad was your brother.

36:17.960 --> 36:22.443
There are reasons but they don't matter.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.011
They don't change what I did.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.646
I killed your brother.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.604
No.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.448
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.001
You are gonna be great. Break a leg.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.641
Sorry.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.881
Okay.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.167
Hmm.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.801
Welcome.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.884
This is a day I have looked forward to
for a very long time.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.330
Because today, I stand...

37:14.080 --> 37:16.401
On the shoulders of many giants.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.847
Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison,

37:19.520 --> 37:23.366
Ray Palmer and, of course, Curtis Holt.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.522
Their work has always been about
making this world a better place.

37:28.720 --> 37:33.681
And today, we get to take another step
towards that goal.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.521
As you know, battery technology has been
at a virtual standstill for decades,

37:37.680 --> 37:42.481
with batteries lasting, nor charging,
any faster than they did in the 1970s.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.840
Until now.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.481
Today, Palmer Tech is pleased to
introduce the Power Cell.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.411
A 100% recyclable battery.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.849
It can charge an electric car
for thousands of miles.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.483
And right now, it is single-handedly

38:00.640 --> 38:04.201
not only powering
this entire presentation,

38:05.920 --> 38:07.251
but this entire building.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.524
She's something else, isn't she?

38:20.880 --> 38:22.041
You have no idea.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.887
You know, you should be a nurse
in your new life.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.891
You're a natural.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.730
Only problem is, I am a one-patient man.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.210
And I am already committed to you.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.085
Is that why you're leaving?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.361
You know, I get it.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.723
Star City is filled with too many people
who can recognize you.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.647
You know, I thought about staying anyway.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.886
<i>For you.</i>

38:57.600 --> 38:59.921
You know what you could do? For me?

39:00.400 --> 39:03.563
Go live an amazing life.

39:05.080 --> 39:09.324
Get married, have a couple kids.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.641
Yeah.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.245
And get a minivan.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.603
Just go be normal.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.446
There's nothing in this world
that would make me happier than that.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.607
You know,
if I could do all of this over again...

39:31.160 --> 39:33.401
I would do every
single one of those things with you.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.646
Me, too.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.125
I love you, Thea Queen.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.645
I love you, Roy Harper.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.602
You were amazing out there.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.844
Thanks. How's Thea doing?

40:00.160 --> 40:01.321
I'm gonna go check on her now.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.324
I'm just gonna debrief with Curtis,
but text me how she's doing, okay?

40:04.480 --> 40:05.606
Okay.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.291
Oh, my God.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.641
Dad?

40:28.800 --> 40:30.689
- How is she?
- Resting.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.561
Where's your new BFF Damien?

40:32.800 --> 40:34.006
I don't know.

40:34.240 --> 40:37.005
Like you said, this is Thea's decision,
it's not mine.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.204
Oliver, I know it feels wrong,
but you did the right thing.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.086
However it feels,
I couldn't have done it without you.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.522
Malcolm, thank you. For everything.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.163
Oliver. It's Thea.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.043
How long will she be in a coma?

41:02.720 --> 41:05.690
Right now she's barely a three
on the Glasgow Scale.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.685
The prognosis isn't good.
I'm sorry.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.444
Thea, please, don't go.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.284
There's only one way to prevent that.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.126
My father once told me of an elixir
known as the Lotus.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.400
Capable of countering
the effects of the Lazarus Pit,

41:40.600 --> 41:42.762
a secret weapon developed by
the League's enemies.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.128
- Do you have it?
- I do.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.129
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.560
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.521
English SDH
