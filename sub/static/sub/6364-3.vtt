00:05.172 --> 00:06.205
Good, bad, ugly.

You should have told me.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.774
- I've been clean
for seven months.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.642

So many times.
- But this is different, baby.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.046

[siren blaring]

01:07.535 --> 01:09.101
- Shot to the neck.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.569
My partner's got her
behind the bar.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.504

01:26.620 --> 01:29.321
- So you knew the victim?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.656
- Maddie callahan.
She worked there.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.424
- No i.D. On the shooter?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.259
- No, patrol's going door to
door in the neighborhood

01:34.261 --> 01:35.494
Looking for witnesses.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.463
- That was the hospital.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.365
Your friend's in icu,
but she's alive.

01:40.367 --> 01:44.636
- Thanks.
- Hey, it's not your fault.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.271
Someone needs to talk
to bembenek.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.474
- Oh, olinsky's already
on that.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.243
- A black arcadia was found
abandoned in englewood.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.711
It matches the description
of the getaway vehicle,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.580
But there's no prints.
They torched it.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.348
- White male just checked
into a south side clinic

01:56.350 --> 01:57.850
About a half hour ago,
two bullet wounds.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.585
- All right, lindsay,
antonio, get on it.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.553
No, no, no, jay.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.523
You're in protective custody
until this dies down.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.524
- They shot my friend.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.658
They nearly killed
me and erin.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.360
- You got a target
on your back.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.329
You're not going anywhere
till that target's removed.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.364
- So i'm under
house arrest?

02:12.366 --> 02:15.567
- You wanted to see us,
sergeant?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.870
- Halstead doesn't leave
your sight until i say so.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.538
And he stays here
at the 21st.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.572
- You got it.
- They don't have to stay

02:20.574 --> 02:21.607
Up here to keep
an eye on me.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.876
You--you got to be
kidding me!

02:27.381 --> 02:29.581
- Keep an eye on him.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.719
- Sorry, guys.
- Hey--

02:33.721 --> 02:36.555
- Oh, the investigation
can begin, everyone.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.524
Nadia's here.
What, did you take a bus?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.192
- Two, actually.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.527
- What are you doing here,
nadia,

02:41.528 --> 02:42.861
Answering phones
for 12 bucks an hour?

02:42.863 --> 02:43.862
- Hey, it's a start.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.365
- No, pumpkin,
it's an end.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.766
You're going to be up there
until your boobs

02:47.768 --> 02:49.301
Are bouncing
off your knees,

02:49.303 --> 02:50.836
And all you're going to have
to show for it

02:50.838 --> 02:52.704
Is free dental,
maybe a couple of flings

02:52.706 --> 02:54.406
With some married cops.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.607
- I'm going to be a cop
one day,

02:55.609 --> 02:56.775
And a damn good one.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.377
- Not going to happen.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.712
Not with your resume.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.819
- Happy birthday,
sergeant.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.794
- Hey.
- Lindsay, you got a visitor.

03:20.634 --> 03:21.867
- You got to be
kidding me.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.569
- Who's that?

03:23.571 --> 03:24.903
- I'll meet you
in the car.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.406
- Make it quick.
- Yeah.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.807
I am in the middle
of something.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.709
- I emailed you
like you told me to,

03:30.711 --> 03:33.345
But you didn't answer me, so--
- summarize your email.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.647
- I'm getting married today.

03:35.649 --> 03:39.418
At 5:00.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.420
- Why do you want
me there?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.854
Really.
I met the guy,

03:42.856 --> 03:45.257
I played along,
me and you, we're best friends.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.925
And if johnny didn't buy it,
i'm sorry.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
That's the best i can do.

03:48.562 --> 03:53.298
- Could you just put your
machete down for one minute?

03:53.300 --> 03:55.567
I'm getting married.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.769
You're my only child.

03:57.771 --> 04:01.640
I'm trying to turn
my life around.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.642
- I gotta go.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.947
[door buzzes]

04:30.304 --> 04:32.604
- So they got you
in protective custody, i hear.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.873
You got a lot of enemies
in gen pop, don't you?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.375
- [scoffs]
nah.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.277
Just friends.
I got friends everywhere.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.811
- Me too.

04:39.813 --> 04:44.516
The warden
used to be a cop.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.953
I know you're afraid
to die, oskar.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.789
I could always see it
in your eyes.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.696
So i'm here
to give you one chance...

04:57.698 --> 04:59.898
To live.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.900
You call off the hit
on halstead,

05:01.902 --> 05:03.835
And you tell me

05:03.837 --> 05:05.804
Who it was tried
to take him out at that bar.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.673
- Wait, wait--
we're talking about

05:07.675 --> 05:10.309
The detective halstead
that killed my brother?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.477
That halstead?
- Listen to me.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.812
Carefully.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.515
I'm giving you
one chance.

05:16.517 --> 05:20.052
[tapping]
- i'm doing time.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.954
Trying to get my head
around that.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.626
Can't be worried about
the outside world.

05:39.039 --> 05:39.471
.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.173
- Hey.
Hey, sergeant.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.874
Listen, we know bembenek
put this contract

05:42.876 --> 05:44.876
Out from prison,
but he's not talking.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.579
So we turned his cell
upside down, we got nothing.

05:47.581 --> 05:51.783
We think he put the call out
from a prison land line.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.919
Olinsky knows the warden,
says you know somebody

05:53.921 --> 05:55.954
In the sheriff's office
who handles these things.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.956
So if there's any way
i could get those recordings

05:57.958 --> 05:59.624
Without having to go through
all the red tape,

05:59.626 --> 06:04.830
That would be...
Well, that would be dandy.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.599
- Deputy radigan.
I'll give you her number.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.101
- Sweet.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.736
What the hell is that?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.437
- This?
- Yeah.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.839
- It's a ham sandwich.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.776
No, it's a shrimp boat.
You want the number or not?

06:17.778 --> 06:18.977
- Yes, please.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.512
- Let me ask
you something.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.548
- Mm-hmm.
- How's nadia doing up there?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.450
- She's killing it.
Why?

06:25.452 --> 06:28.520
No reason.
- Thank you.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.896
- Where are you going,
donald?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.931
- Do i know you?

06:39.933 --> 06:43.402
- What did you
get treated for?

06:43.404 --> 06:46.471
- Hey, look, i just--
ah!

06:46.473 --> 06:49.474
I accidentally
thumbed the trigger.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.742
Pow.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.878
- Twice, in the back?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.647
- Detective dawson,
i'm going to bet you

06:55.649 --> 06:56.948
A week's salary that
the bullets they took

06:56.950 --> 06:58.650
Out of his shoulder
are going to match my gun.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.619
- You couldn't give me odds
high enough to take that bet.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.588
- You tell us what happened
before we get the slugs

07:03.590 --> 07:06.491
From the nurse,
you're officially co-operative.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.460
You wait until after,
and you just bought yourself

07:08.462 --> 07:11.046
Another ten years.

07:11.047 --> 07:13.631
- I just drove.
I swear to god, i just drove.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.034
And i sure as hell didn't know
a cop was the target.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.470
- Who was the shooter?

07:18.472 --> 07:21.473
- Nurse.
- He's my friend, man.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.476
[knocking]
- karl forsman!

07:24.478 --> 07:26.545
[clattering]

07:26.547 --> 07:27.679
- Chicago pd!

07:27.681 --> 07:30.749
- Come on, hit it.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.986
- Stop! Police!

07:48.836 --> 07:49.901
- Uhh!

07:52.906 --> 07:55.540
- Get up.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.709
- Uhh!
- There we go.

07:59.546 --> 08:03.181
- Opened up on a couple
of cops last night, huh, karl?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.249
- [snorts]

08:08.856 --> 08:10.555
- That hurt my feelings.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.947
Don't you have
some paperwork to do, kevin?

08:35.948 --> 08:36.948
- Yeah.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.519
Yeah, i got some
typing to do.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.102
- Oof!

08:57.104 --> 09:00.171
[gags, grunts]

09:00.173 --> 09:03.041
[coughs, gasps]

09:04.211 --> 09:05.877
- Did you grow up
catholic, karl?

09:05.879 --> 09:10.215
I mean, most poles
are catholic, right?

09:10.217 --> 09:13.685
Remember hearing
about purgatory?

09:13.687 --> 09:14.953
I mean, if you weren't
paying attention,

09:14.955 --> 09:20.825
It's--it's a way station
between heaven and hell.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.160
It's like this place.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.134
Heaven, for you,
is upstairs.

09:29.136 --> 09:33.204
Cup of coffee,
comfortable chair, we talk.

09:33.206 --> 09:39.110
You tell me why you opened up
on two cops,

09:39.112 --> 09:43.114
Put a girl in the hospital
with a hole in her neck,

09:43.116 --> 09:46.685
Clinging to life.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.690
Hell...

09:51.692 --> 09:56.695
It's a place we call
the silos.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.665
About a 15-minute drive
from here.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.866
- [stifled grunt]

10:01.868 --> 10:04.736
[short breaths]

10:04.738 --> 10:06.771
Where do you want to go?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.612
- Okay.
Okay.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.715
Got it.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.883
Uh, detective halstead?

10:18.885 --> 10:21.386
Sergeant voight is on
his way up with the suspect.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.756
Um, he asked that on his way
to the interview room,

10:24.758 --> 10:27.759
You wait in his office
for them to pass by.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.861
- Which suspect?
- Uh...

10:29.863 --> 10:31.930
Maybe it's better
that you don't know, right?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.398
- Is it the shooter?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.000
- Let's head
in voight's office, jay.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.872
- First of all,
it's detective.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.107
Second of all,
let's not me and you

10:42.109 --> 10:43.675
Get off on the wrong foot.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.844
- I'm all for that.
But if you can join me

10:45.846 --> 10:49.014
In voight's office, detective,
that'd be great.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.762
- That's him, that's--
- hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.765
- Sarge, give me five minutes.
Gimme five minutes!

11:06.767 --> 11:07.999
- Is that what we're
going to do, throw?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.234
Because you're not walking
past me

11:09.236 --> 11:10.802
Until i get an "all clear."

11:10.804 --> 11:12.771
You got that?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.318
- Mm.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.956
- I was at the club.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.125
Some, uh, higher-level guys
were talking

11:34.127 --> 11:38.930
About the contract
on this cop, halstead.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.766
I've been trying
to move up, impress the guys.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.302
Hell, a hundred grand for
the hit wouldn't hurt either.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.870
- It's just you
and this driver?

11:45.872 --> 11:49.040
Novak?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.210
- Yeah, that's it.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.230
Did he give me up?

11:55.231 --> 11:58.249
- Tends to happen when people
are looking at murder charges.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.284
- Yeah.
[scoffs]

11:59.286 --> 12:01.853
Well, for whatever
it's worth,

12:01.855 --> 12:04.055
I wasn't going to go after
anyone else on that list.

12:04.057 --> 12:08.927
- Wait, hold it.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.762
What list?
What are you talking about?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.865
- The list.
Bembenek has a hit list.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.233
If he was going to go
away to prison,

12:15.235 --> 12:17.001
He wanted certain people
killed.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.938
- How many people?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.439
- I don't know.
But it was more

12:21.441 --> 12:24.042
Than just the cop
on there.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.911
[door opens]
- antonio's in logan square.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.914
He's saying he needs you
down there.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.916
- I'll let you
keep him company.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.793
[police radio chatter]

12:43.263 --> 12:44.429
- The assistant
state's attorney

12:44.431 --> 12:47.198
In bembenek's murder trial,
steve kot?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.933
- Yeah.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.908
- Kot's daughter.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.077
Two shots to the skull.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.979
16.

13:05.118 --> 13:05.350
.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.063
- Doubling up on squad cars
in front of all the homes

13:07.064 --> 13:08.775
Of the people involved
in the bembenek trial.

13:08.776 --> 13:10.487
There's judges,
lawyers, clerks.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.440
- Bembenek
anticipated that.

13:12.441 --> 13:14.391
That's why he's going after
their family members.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.294
- Two taps to the head
without an eye witness.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.929
That was
a professional hit.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.563
- And we have no idea how many
people are on this list?

13:19.566 --> 13:22.033
- No.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.134
- Hey, will you call
chicago med

13:23.136 --> 13:26.304
And check on maddie
from the bar?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.340
- Yeah, of course.
[phone buzzes]

13:29.342 --> 13:30.575
Hello?

13:30.577 --> 13:33.344
- How'd you know
it was my birthday?

13:33.346 --> 13:36.014
- I have access to all
the personnel files.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.415
Wasn't that hard
to figure out.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.151
And i can assure you
it won't happen again.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.520
Anything else, sergeant?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.521
- No.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.458
- You have a good day.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.060
- Hey, everyone,
this is, uh,

13:49.062 --> 13:50.361
Sheriff charlene radigan.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.996
She helped me secure
phone recordings

13:51.998 --> 13:54.199
Bembenek made on
a cook county land line.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.817
- Most of the calls
are in polish.

13:55.818 --> 13:57.434
Inmates switch to their
native tongues all the time

13:57.437 --> 13:59.437
When they try to cover up
what they're talking about.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.939
- So we're going to need
a translator.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.373
Forsman kid flipped,
right?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.075
You think he'd--
you think he'd do it?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.544
- He'll paint my house
if i want him to.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.313
It's in here.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.549
- Remember, this saturday,
f.O.P. Picnic.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.285
Corn dogs.
- Corn dogs.

14:15.589 --> 14:18.623
- [ahem]
gotta get a cup of coffee.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.492
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get some coffee too.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.461
- Yeah, right.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.635
- So listen, i don't know
what that sounded like,

14:30.637 --> 14:32.570
But i'm not going
to the f.O.P. Picnic with her.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.072
- Corn dogs?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.340
- She mans
the booth i guess.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.875
I told her i like them.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.409
Doesn't everybody like them?
You like them?

14:38.411 --> 14:41.145
- Adam, maybe this
is getting too complicated.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.581
- Stop.
Look, she asked me to go, yes.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.384
I probably should have said,
"no, thank you," flat out, but--

14:46.386 --> 14:48.620
- Maybe we need
to take a break.

14:52.459 --> 14:57.528
- [speaking polish]

14:59.332 --> 15:01.199
- Uh, i don't know who's on
the other end of that call.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.568
I've never heard
that voice before.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.169
He just told bembenek
"i've got the list.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.372
Just tell me when
you want to go shopping."

15:07.374 --> 15:08.606
- We tried to triangulate

15:08.608 --> 15:10.308
The location of where
that call went,

15:10.310 --> 15:11.509
But no luck.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.911
Phone was a throwaway.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.246
- [speaking polish]
- [speaking polish]

15:15.248 --> 15:17.248
- The guy's upset that bembenek
offered the job

15:17.250 --> 15:19.617
To somebody else first.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.353
Somebody named jp.

15:22.355 --> 15:27.492
- Jp?
Joe price.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.960
I thought he was out
of the game.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.263
- Let's find out.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.069
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.570
Sorry, man.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.374
Is there something
you want to say to me?

15:43.376 --> 15:46.411
- You really don't
remember me, do you?

15:46.413 --> 15:47.412
- Should i?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.414
- Patrolman byrne.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.716
That doesn't ring
a bell?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.422
- What's with
the guessing game?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.525
- You know what?
Forget it.

16:00.527 --> 16:05.096
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here, come here.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.698
Listen,
when your testicles drop

16:06.700 --> 16:09.167
And you finally decide to
tell me what your problem is,

16:09.169 --> 16:10.852
I'm all ears.
But until then,

16:10.853 --> 16:12.536
You do not walk around here
giving me the high hat.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.505
Is that clear?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.240
- Absolutely clear.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.743
- Okay.

16:36.563 --> 16:41.032
- Mike, why don't you head into
the house for a minute, okay?

16:41.034 --> 16:43.067
- What's up, jp?

16:43.069 --> 16:44.736
- Long time, detectives.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.371
How are you guys doing?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.639
How's tricks?
- Kid looks good.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.641
- Yeah, couldn't
be prouder.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.478
Get to spend a lot more time
with him these days,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.413
So thank the good lord
for that, right?

16:55.415 --> 16:56.714
You guys parents?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.716
- Why'd your name come up
on a recorded call

16:58.718 --> 17:01.619
Oskar bembenek made
from cook county?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.021
- Can't help
who calls me.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.656
- We know you were offered
the contract.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.425
- Then you also know
i turned it down.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.493
I'm retired.
Ask ray zancanelli.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.229
He'll tell you.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.065
I just hang out
with the kid these days.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.601
That's it.
- How big is the hit list?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.736
- Conversation
didn't go that far.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.637
[phone ringing]
i said "no thanks," click.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.723
- Hello.

17:21.723 --> 17:22.807
- The judge
from the bembenek trial,

17:22.809 --> 17:25.276
Joseph murray,

17:25.278 --> 17:28.613
Just found his mother
with two in the head.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.618
- You need to come down
to the district.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.186
- I can't help you guys.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.753
- You don't know what
you can do for us.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.625
- At least let me tell
my son.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.326
- Just get in the car.
Come on.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.770
- How are you holding up?
- Not well.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.206
My mother's got this house
on irving park.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.642
I pay the mortgage,
and they've frozen my assets.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.677
- Is there someone
that can help you out?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.646
- Why do you think
i'm talking to you?

18:01.648 --> 18:04.449
- You know who bembenek's
talking to?

18:08.822 --> 18:11.656
A name
would be helpful.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.825
- Look, we got
a 16-year-old girl,

18:13.827 --> 18:16.861
70-year-old woman,

18:16.863 --> 18:19.530
Both executed.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.799
What, are you going
to just sit here and...

18:21.801 --> 18:24.769
Let another innocent
family member get killed?

18:27.540 --> 18:31.175
- My son is trying
to get into tsa.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.111
He's got this pissant
obstruction charge

18:33.113 --> 18:35.713
From when he was 18.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.349
Get that charge sealed,
i'm here to help.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.351
- That would take time.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.786
Time we don't have.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.355
- All i need is a handshake
and your word.

18:51.731 --> 18:56.167
Patrick shostak.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.637
New breed
of contract killer.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.509
Back in the day, we...

19:04.511 --> 19:07.612
I don't know.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.847
There was honor in it.

19:12.218 --> 19:16.354
Today, they blow up a city block
to take out one mark.

19:16.356 --> 19:22.493
They murder the kids if
they can't get to the parents.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.562
- [sighs]
yeah.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.365
- I had the stomach
for a lot of things.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.600
But not for that.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.838
- Do you know how to get
ahold of this shostak guy?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.440
- He has
a messaging service.

19:36.442 --> 19:39.277
Whether or not
he calls me back...

19:39.279 --> 19:40.878
- Give it a go.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.282
- If he calls me back
i say what?

19:44.284 --> 19:47.185
- You have halstead,
and you want to make a deal.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.587
And tell him you got
a photo of halstead, dead.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.755
We'll rig it.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.256
- What if he doesn't
go for it?

19:52.258 --> 19:53.591
- Just improvise.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.859
Isn't that
what you had to do

19:54.861 --> 19:56.194
When you're trying
to kill someone

19:56.196 --> 20:00.398
And the plan
went sideways?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.567
- Allegedly.

20:07.507 --> 20:07.838
.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.558
- Command staff has put
together a task force

20:10.559 --> 20:13.277
To try and reach out
to every aunt, uncle, cousin

20:13.279 --> 20:15.479
Of anyone involved
in the bembenek trial...

20:15.481 --> 20:18.282
Although there's only so much
they can do.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.585
- Hey, that was chicago med.

20:20.587 --> 20:21.586
Maddie's heading
into surgery,

20:21.588 --> 20:24.822
So they're going
to let me know.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.490
- She'll pull through.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.959
- I never should
have been there.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.429
- Don't do that to yourself.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.531
- Hey, ruzek and atwater,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.299
I need a cell phone
rigged up right now.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.235
- What's going on?
- Sit tight.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.536
- I'm tired of sitting.
- Sit tight.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.809
- You're never going to be able
to trace a call from him.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.411
He goes from one drop phone
to another.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.646
I don't know why
you're bothering.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.248
- You know what,
how about i do my job,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.516
You do yours?
How about that?

20:54.787 --> 20:56.887
[phone rings]
- boss.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.996
[ringing]

21:07.267 --> 21:10.334
[ringing]

21:10.336 --> 21:12.370
- Hello.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.971
- Jp?

21:13.973 --> 21:17.041
- What's up, shostak?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.477
I have something
you may want.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.445
- I want a lot of things.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.881
- Halstead.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.851
- My understanding is
you turned down this contract.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.588
- And i heard they offered you
a lot more money than me.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.922
I want half.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.691
- Or what?

21:33.693 --> 21:36.494
- Or i let him go.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.980
And you better
think quick.

21:38.981 --> 21:41.465
The dilaudid i pumped into him's
going to wear off soon.

21:41.467 --> 21:45.870
- 1/3rd.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.638
- Okay.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.706
I'll take care of it,

21:48.708 --> 21:50.041
I'll bring you
a photo for proof.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.676
- No, no, no, no, no.

21:51.678 --> 21:52.610
Just because
i'm talking to you

21:52.612 --> 21:54.879
Doesn't mean i trust you.

21:54.881 --> 21:58.582
I want to see him alive.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.518
- Deal.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.353
- Highway between cermak
and kedzie.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.721
30 minutes.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.866
- There's too many risks.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.101
- There's always risks.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.703
- Jay, you'd be in the car
with a hitman.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.838
- Who's retired,
and who we made a deal with.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.373
- Because that
changes everything.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.675
- We don't know how many people
bembenek wants dead.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.982
[chair clatters]

22:33.619 --> 22:35.686
Isn't this enough?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.757
Sarge.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.592
Sarge,

That'll release the city
from all liability.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.673
I don't have
any beneficiaries anyway.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.975

a badge on my chest.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.671
We have these barbecues.

- It's just friends
and the kids,

Anyone who can
stop by really, and

36:50.709 --> 36:52.742
I was wondering if maybe
you could come by sometime.

36:52.744 --> 36:53.877
- Oh, honey, there's lisa.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.278

thank her for it.

a couple of months

37:27.679 --> 37:29.746
Before i came to live
with you,

37:29.748 --> 37:32.782
I borrowed 200 bucks?

37:32.784 --> 37:35.485
- Vaguely.

37:35.487 --> 37:39.656
- That was so i could buy
junk for my mom.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.458
Yeah, she--
[chuckles]

37:41.460 --> 37:42.592
She showed back up,

37:42.594 --> 37:45.762
And she was
in withdrawal real bad.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.565
But i couldn't get her a fix
until the morning, like--

37:48.567 --> 37:50.834
Like right before school.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.469
So, i got it to her,

37:52.471 --> 37:55.739
And right
when she injected it,

37:55.741 --> 38:01.511
She puked all over me.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.413
- Mm
- and the city had shut

38:03.415 --> 38:06.916
The water off by then,
so i couldn't take a shower.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.719
And i went to school
like that.

38:09.721 --> 38:16.559
Ugh, just reeked
of booze and vomit.

38:16.561 --> 38:18.895
And the teacher
pulled me aside

38:18.897 --> 38:22.666
'cause she thought
that i had a drinking problem.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.842
And i copped to it

38:32.844 --> 38:35.812
To protect my mom.

38:42.387 --> 38:46.656
Um, anyway, i just uh,

38:46.658 --> 38:50.026
Wanted to say thanks
for taking me in.

38:54.433 --> 38:57.967
You're my family.

39:04.543 --> 39:09.612
- You're about the best thing
ever happened to me.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.015
And i mean that.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.954
[door opens]

39:27.399 --> 39:29.766
- I thought, uh,
paramedics weren't supposed

39:29.768 --> 39:32.802
To follow up on
people they responded to.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.105
- I-i didn't know
that rule.

39:35.107 --> 39:37.574
I'm still new, i guess.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.411
- Is there any update?

39:41.413 --> 39:43.146
- Waiting on one.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.949
Maddie's parents
and her sister are in there.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.857
- You know, i've--i've seen
dead bodies,

39:53.859 --> 39:59.028
And i've seen
people shot in front of me.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.599
But uh...

40:02.601 --> 40:05.135
I've never seen
somebody...

40:05.137 --> 40:09.038
Take a bullet that was
meant for me.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.176
[door opens]

40:13.178 --> 40:14.944
- Alec.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.113
- Okay, uh,
here's the latest.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.149
The bullet severed
the subclavian vein.

40:19.151 --> 40:21.885
The emergency surgery
was to repair the rupture.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.553
Thankfully the bullet
missed the jugular

40:23.555 --> 40:24.988
And the spine.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.890
So she's going to be
in the icu

40:26.892 --> 40:29.492
For at least another week,
but we're very optimistic.

40:29.494 --> 40:32.962
She's going to be okay.
- That's so good to hear.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.531
- Thanks.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.099
- [exhales deeply]
wow, right?

40:36.101 --> 40:40.737
What a relief.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.773
- A bunch of folks at 51
are down at molly's

40:43.775 --> 40:44.874
If you wanna join.

40:44.876 --> 40:48.077
We'll raise a beer to maddie.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.547
- Sounds good. Yeah.
I'll see you there.
