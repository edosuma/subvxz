us it made its way to US soil.

That's not
my problem anymore.

MacGruber, the X-5 is one of
the most powerful nuclear...

Yeah, I know
what the X-5 is.

Lieutenant, give us
a minute, will you?

06:52.425 --> 06:53.449
Yes, sir.

Mac, you're
our only hope.

about Casey, she...

07:10.343 --> 07:13.904
It's not about Casey.
It's about a promise I made to myself.

No, you listen!

But the players are the same.

it's Cunth.

07:22.989 --> 07:24.081
What?

07:24.190 --> 07:26.658
We have reason
to believe

07:26.760 --> 07:30.389
the X-5 is now in the
possession of Dieter Von Cunth.

Jim. But I can.

10:16.863 --> 10:17.989
So what do we
know so far?

10:18.097 --> 10:19.621
Very little,
unfortunately.

10:19.732 --> 10:22.360
We think Cunth smuggled
the X-5 into the US,

10:22.468 --> 10:24.959
but we lost the trail before we
could pin any hard evidence on him.

10:25.071 --> 10:27.699
I was actually talking
to the Colonel. Colonel?

10:27.807 --> 10:29.798
Everything Piper
just said is correct.

10:29.909 --> 10:32.139
Thank you, Colonel.

10:33.146 --> 10:34.408
Well, then,
if you'll excuse me,

10:34.514 --> 10:35.845
it's time to go
pound some Cunth.

10:35.949 --> 10:38.850
Mac. It's not
that easy.

10:38.952 --> 10:41.785
Sure, to us, he's a black market arms dealer.
But to everyone else,

10:41.888 --> 10:43.515
he's become
a respected businessman

10:43.623 --> 10:45.113
and a major
political donor.

10:45.224 --> 10:46.248
He's untouchable.

10:46.592 --> 10:48.321
Oh, I'll touch him, rookie.

10:48.428 --> 10:49.986
I'll touch him
wherever I want.

10:50.096 --> 10:51.586
(CHUCKLES)

10:51.698 --> 10:55.031
Now, Mac, one thing we
have working in our favor

10:55.134 --> 10:57.898
is that Cunth needs passcodes
to make the X-5 operational.

10:58.004 --> 11:00.564
It is imperative that Cunth
does not get those codes.

11:00.673 --> 11:02.641
Oh, thanks.
Because before you said something,

11:02.742 --> 11:05.404
I thought it'd be fine
if he got them.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.403
Now, I'm not gonna
lie to you, Mac.

11:09.082 --> 11:11.107
This is a very tall order.

11:11.217 --> 11:13.583
Word on the street is
Cunth's put together a team

11:37.777 --> 11:38.937
No fucking way.

11:44.650 --> 11:46.675

Well, I bet you wish
your nose was a dick,

18:15.207 --> 18:17.107
so you could use it
to fuck butts.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.473
I forget.
The last time I saw you,

18:19.578 --> 18:21.978
did I remember to tell you
how ugly I think you are?

18:22.081 --> 18:24.242
No, you didn't.
Well, I think you're really ugly.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.181
I think you're looking in the mirror.
You want to go?

18:26.285 --> 18:27.912
Any time,
any place.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.648
(SCOFFS) I'm starting
to like this guy.

18:30.756 --> 18:32.917
Just kidding.
I still hate you.

18:33.025 --> 18:34.959
Well, I hate you.
You want to go?

18:35.060 --> 18:37.858
Hey, guys, guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. Cool it.

18:40.299 --> 18:44.736
So, MacGruber, we understand
you've recruited quite a team.

18:44.837 --> 18:47.829
Quite a team? Yeah,
you could say that.

18:47.940 --> 18:52.570
Frank Korver, Tanker Lutz, Tut Beemer,
Tug Phelps, Vernon Freedom, moi.

18:53.512 --> 18:54.672
Yeah, I'd say
it's a pretty good team.

18:56.215 --> 18:57.204
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:57.316 --> 18:58.806
Look, Mac, are you sure
you won't change your mind

18:58.918 --> 19:00.249
about letting Piper
here join you?

19:00.352 --> 19:02.013
He'd make
a hell of an asset.

19:02.121 --> 19:06.023
Oh, I would love to,
but the van's pretty full.

19:07.059 --> 19:08.686
You see, it's filled
with American heroes

19:08.794 --> 19:11.627
with over a hundred years
of combined combat experience

19:11.730 --> 19:13.823
and a whole lot
of brotherhood.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.924
(MOCKINGLY) And no, you can't
ride in the trunk, bud!

19:16.602 --> 19:21.539
'Cause the trunk is filled with over
75 pounds of homemade C-4 explosive

19:21.640 --> 19:25.406
that I personally packed in
there with my own two...

19:29.782 --> 19:31.647
Oh, fuck!

19:32.918 --> 19:36.615
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

19:36.722 --> 19:40.214
Tut, Tug!
You guys okay?

19:40.326 --> 19:42.817
Oh, somebody's
gotta be in there!

19:43.329 --> 19:44.728
Oh! Oh!

19:45.197 --> 19:48.724
Call 911! Call 911!

19:50.769 --> 19:54.227
(SOBBING) Oh, God!
Oh, God!

19:54.740 --> 19:57.937
(SCREAMS)

20:01.947 --> 20:04.040
They were nice funerals.

20:04.149 --> 20:08.245
Yeah. What did you
think of my eulogies?

20:10.523 --> 20:12.115
Very touching.

20:12.224 --> 20:15.193
I might have cut back
on the F-words a little.

20:15.294 --> 20:17.524
Well, they were
fucking great guys.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.723
And this is a fucking
asshole of a day.

20:19.832 --> 20:21.094
I know.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.901
It's just that their kids were there.

20:24.003 --> 20:25.197
They laughed.

20:25.304 --> 20:27.602
Because of your use
of heavy language.

20:27.706 --> 20:29.333
Well, fuck 'em.

20:31.544 --> 20:33.375
I should have
been in that van.

20:33.479 --> 20:34.741
But you weren't.

20:34.847 --> 20:36.371
No, I wasn't.

20:36.482 --> 20:39.110
And nobody's gonna regret
that more than Cunth.

20:40.319 --> 20:41.650
MacGruber, about that.

20:41.921 --> 20:42.910
Look, I'm taking you
off the case.

20:44.890 --> 20:46.357
I'm sorry, I must
have heard wrong.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.289
'Cause I thought
I just heard you say,

20:48.394 --> 20:49.418
"MacGruber, about that.

20:49.528 --> 20:50.756
"Look, I'm taking you
off the case."

20:50.863 --> 20:52.125
That's exactly
what I said.

20:52.231 --> 20:54.597
Damn it, Jim.
You can't do that. Okay?

20:54.700 --> 20:55.894
I'm the best
chance you got.

20:56.001 --> 20:57.832
You told me yourself
at the monastery.

20:57.937 --> 20:59.199
But the game has changed!

20:59.305 --> 21:00.533
But the players
are the same!

21:00.639 --> 21:02.539
Mac, I got no choice.

21:02.641 --> 21:05.769
Look, you've been through
a very traumatic experience.

21:05.878 --> 21:07.209
You're too close.

21:07.313 --> 21:08.678
And without a team
behind you,

21:09.214 --> 21:11.705
I just can't chance it.

21:11.817 --> 21:13.785
I'm sorry, Grubes.

21:27.499 --> 21:29.399
Sir, I just...
Piper.

21:29.501 --> 21:30.866
Where's the Colonel?

21:30.970 --> 21:33.632
You gotta help me.
They want to kick me off the mission.

21:33.739 --> 21:35.001
Well, under
the circumstances...

21:35.107 --> 21:36.802
Fuck you, dickhead!
All right.

21:36.909 --> 21:38.809
Wait, wait, wait! I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

21:38.911 --> 21:40.378
What do you want,
MacGruber?

21:41.080 --> 21:43.048
Join my team.
What?

21:43.148 --> 21:46.242
Join my new team, and tell
the Colonel I can do this.

21:46.352 --> 21:47.319
I can't do that.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.951
Okay, don't make
me beg here.

21:51.056 --> 21:52.284
'Cause I will do it.

21:54.059 --> 21:55.287
I am so sorry.

21:57.262 --> 21:59.753
(SOBBING)
I'm so goddamn sorry.

21:59.865 --> 22:02.527
Look, I'm freaking
out here.

22:02.635 --> 22:04.796
I killed them.
I killed them all!

I'm so fucking stupid!

22:08.374 --> 22:11.639
I don't know what I'm doing
and everybody hates me!

22:15.748 --> 22:18.410
Look, I will
suck your dick.

22:19.451 --> 22:20.884
I will suck
your fucking dick.

22:20.986 --> 22:23.716
I will do it,
just join my team.

or get fucked by me.

You can watch me
fuck something.

Just point at something in the
room and I'll fuck it for you.

what you want me to fuck!

Just tell me
what you want me to fuck.

22:42.174 --> 22:44.540
Okay, I don't have any lubricant.
Do you see any Wite-Out?

22:44.643 --> 22:46.406
Or, like, copy toner
should work, or...

22:46.512 --> 22:48.503

22:48.614 --> 22:49.581

23:03.262 --> 23:04.820
The man who
killed my wife

23:04.930 --> 23:07.160
is in control of
a nuclear warhead,

23:07.266 --> 23:09.427
and I can't do a goddamn
thing about it!

23:09.535 --> 23:11.230
And it's not so bad?

23:13.005 --> 23:14.529
Cunth killed your wife?

23:16.341 --> 23:19.242
It was never proven
in a court of law,

23:19.344 --> 23:21.744
but I saw it
with my own eyes.

23:22.848 --> 23:25.476
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

my chance to do

23:27.586 --> 23:30.350
what I should have
done 10 years ago.

23:30.456 --> 23:32.048

waiting to take you

23:34.226 --> 23:36.217

what happened.

use some help.

I got myself a new team.

24:24.376 --> 24:25.604

here, MacGruber?

Vicki.

Cunth owns this place,

24:48.066 --> 24:51.001
so if we wanna find out where
that passcode deal is going down,

we gotta turn
over some stones.

the hell was that?

"sending a message."

received loud and clear.

That's what
I'm worried about.

26:56.094 --> 26:57.288
Why?

26:57.396 --> 26:58.920
Because he thought
you were dead.

(CHUCKLES) Gotcha!
It's pretty good, huh?

29:04.723 --> 29:05.690
Can we talk
about this, please?

29:05.791 --> 29:07.190
Well, there's nothing
to talk about.

29:07.292 --> 29:09.283
Everybody knows
that rats like cheese.

29:09.394 --> 29:11.726
And you, Vicki,
are the cheese.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.058
But you're the one
he wants to come after.

29:13.165 --> 29:15.133
Why can't you be
dressed like you?

29:15.233 --> 29:16.666
Because...

29:17.169 --> 29:18.158
You are.

29:18.270 --> 29:21.467
I have to say, I have some serious
concerns about this operation.

29:21.573 --> 29:23.541
If you think that I would
let that monster Cunth

29:23.642 --> 29:25.610
touch one hair
on Vicki's head,

29:25.911 --> 29:26.900
then you're
sorely mistaken.

29:27.012 --> 29:28.001
Thank you.

29:28.113 --> 29:30.240
He'll get close to her,
possibly dangerously close.

29:30.348 --> 29:33.146
And of course, in this line of
business, anything can happen.

29:33.251 --> 29:35.116
But I know that Vicki
can take care of herself.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.744
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

29:36.855 --> 29:38.755
Don't worry.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.188
When you turn around
at gunpoint,

29:40.292 --> 29:42.089
and they see that
it's not me,

29:42.194 --> 29:43.752
they are gonna
be so furious,

29:43.862 --> 29:45.454
they're not gonna
know what to do.

29:45.564 --> 29:46.622
And that's when
we got them.

29:51.236 --> 29:52.203
Hmm.

29:52.304 --> 29:53.271
What?

29:53.371 --> 29:54.770
You just look
really pretty.

29:56.041 --> 29:57.201
Thank you?

29:57.309 --> 29:59.243
Come on, Piper.
Come on, MacGruber.

29:59.344 --> 30:00.641
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

30:07.119 --> 30:09.417
All right, Vick.
If we're gonna draw this bastard out,

30:09.521 --> 30:12.513
he's gotta think he's got eyes
on the real live MacGruber.

30:13.258 --> 30:14.282
Okay.

30:14.392 --> 30:15.859
MACGRUBER ON RADIO: Okay, don't
worry, we got your back.

30:15.961 --> 30:17.861
We're only seven blocks away,
so if anything goes down...

30:17.963 --> 30:18.930
Seven blocks?

30:19.030 --> 30:21.089
Okay, you got me.
About 20 blocks.

30:21.199 --> 30:23.394
But if anything goes down,
we'll be right there.

30:23.502 --> 30:24.526
Wasn't anything closer?

30:24.636 --> 30:26.467
Nope. There were tons
of spots closer.

30:26.571 --> 30:28.232
Yeah, with meters.

30:28.340 --> 30:31.309
Fine. Look, I don't think I
should be talking to you anymore,

30:31.409 --> 30:34.606
because people are gonna be staring at me
and thinking that I'm talking to myself.

30:34.713 --> 30:37.739
And I don't want
to attract attention.

30:39.050 --> 30:40.984
And I'm at the counter,

30:42.387 --> 30:44.446
so just gonna order now.

30:45.290 --> 30:46.257
Can I help you?

30:46.358 --> 30:47.985
(TIMIDLY) Can I have a small latte?

30:48.093 --> 30:49.151
No, no, no.

30:49.261 --> 30:51.388
MacGruber would
never order that.

30:51.496 --> 30:53.396
I'm all about
the large Tazo tea.

30:53.498 --> 30:56.797
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Can I change that?

30:56.902 --> 30:58.767
Can I get
a large Tazo tea?

30:58.870 --> 31:00.030
Sure. Anything else?

31:00.138 --> 31:01.400
No!
No!

31:02.774 --> 31:03.866
(MOUTHING) Sorry.

31:03.975 --> 31:04.999
Can I get your name?

31:05.110 --> 31:06.907
I'll let you take
this one, Vick.

31:07.012 --> 31:08.980
Um... (LOUDLY) MacGruber.

31:09.247 --> 31:10.714
Good job.

31:13.151 --> 31:14.311
It's gonna be $3.45.

31:14.419 --> 31:18.753
Yes, it is. That's what it
is every time I get it.

31:21.459 --> 31:22.448
(SOFTLY) Thanks.

31:23.295 --> 31:26.355
No, Vicki, no tip. What are you doing?
Get that tip back.

31:26.498 --> 31:28.557
I have to...

31:36.675 --> 31:37.664
I'm sorry.

31:37.776 --> 31:38.936
No, say you're not sorry.

31:39.044 --> 31:41.137
I'm not...
I'm not sorry.

31:41.246 --> 31:45.182
(WHISPERING) I mean, I'm sorry.
As me, I'm sorry.

31:45.684 --> 31:47.083
Wow.

31:47.185 --> 31:49.653
Okay, now why don't you move
down to the end of the counter?

31:49.754 --> 31:53.281
Further. Further...
Stop! Stop!

31:53.391 --> 31:54.653
MacGruber.

31:54.759 --> 31:55.726
That's me.

31:55.827 --> 31:59.524
Now, here is the most important thing.
Listen carefully.

31:59.631 --> 32:02.691
With your left hand, lift
the cup up to your mouth.

32:02.801 --> 32:05.463
Open your lips,
then tilt the cup back

32:05.570 --> 32:06.662
until the liquid...

32:06.771 --> 32:08.898
(GUN FIRING)
Down, down, down!

32:09.107 --> 32:11.098
(MACGRUBER SCREAMING)

32:12.444 --> 32:13.741
(SCREAMING)

32:23.188 --> 32:24.746
MACGRUBER: We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

32:25.991 --> 32:27.390
Hand me that
Incredi-Mop!

32:27.492 --> 32:28.720
I'm a little busy
at the moment!

32:30.095 --> 32:32.154
Hand me that Incredi-Mop,
and that is an order!

32:32.264 --> 32:33.356
(SCREAMING)

32:33.465 --> 32:34.762
Fine!

32:39.271 --> 32:43.002
(CRYING) No!
Oh, my God! No!

32:48.480 --> 32:50.038
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTING)

32:56.488 --> 33:00.686
Oh, God! Oh, no!
Oh, my God.

33:02.294 --> 33:05.388
Vicki? Oh, my God!
You're alive?

33:05.497 --> 33:08.398
Yeah, we're alive. We're coming over there.
Meet us out in the alley.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.365
Okay. (SIGHS IN RELIEF)

33:18.176 --> 33:19.734
(CLEARS THROAT)

33:24.616 --> 33:27.016
My teammates
were getting shot.

33:32.223 --> 33:35.021
They're alive.
They made it.

33:37.195 --> 33:38.219
Thank you.

33:41.599 --> 33:43.157
That was nice work
with that Incredi-Mop.

33:43.268 --> 33:45.532
Yeah, it would be a good
commercial for their product.

33:45.637 --> 33:48.105
I'm not so sure
that it would be.

33:50.475 --> 33:54.434
Hoss Bender.
Dead at the age of who-the-fuck-cares.

33:57.182 --> 33:58.308
MacGruber!

33:58.416 --> 33:59.713
Vicki.

34:00.418 --> 34:01.510
(CHUCKLING) Ooh.
(CAR ALARM BEEPS)

34:01.619 --> 34:03.780
MacGruber, I was
so worried about you.

34:03.888 --> 34:06.254
Well, I was really worried
about you, too, Vick.

34:06.358 --> 34:07.882
Really?
Yeah.

34:08.592 --> 34:10.288
I mean, I only have,
like, two of these vests,

34:10.395 --> 34:11.657
so if either of them
got shot up,

34:11.763 --> 34:13.525
it would be a real
bummer for me.

34:13.630 --> 34:14.620
I mean, they're
not expensive.

34:14.733 --> 34:16.530
But they're really hard to find.
Yeah, I got it.

34:16.634 --> 34:19.295
Hey, guys!
I found Hoss' car.

34:21.739 --> 34:22.706
Oh, mama!

34:23.241 --> 34:24.799
That's a whole
lot of wampum.

34:25.543 --> 34:28.137
He's got every strip club
in the city in his GPS.

34:28.246 --> 34:29.543
Hoss Bender, what the hell
are you planning on doing

34:29.647 --> 34:30.614
with all this money?

34:33.385 --> 34:34.443
I think it's
fairly obvious.

34:36.721 --> 34:38.052
He was going to use it
to buy the pass...

34:38.156 --> 34:39.282
Buy the passcodes! Yup.

34:39.391 --> 34:40.380
Got there at
the same time,

34:40.492 --> 34:41.891
maybe even slightly
before you.

34:41.993 --> 34:45.087
Yep, he's gonna use it
to buy the passcodes.

34:45.196 --> 34:46.288
This is weird.

34:46.398 --> 34:49.161
He has an appointment this afternoon,
and all it says is "STD."

34:49.634 --> 34:50.601
Been there.

34:51.703 --> 34:54.570
STD is also code for the
old Stansfield rail yard,

34:54.672 --> 34:55.730
which is about
10 miles from here.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.436
I'm just going to pop
that into this GPS.

34:58.676 --> 34:59.643
Yeah, pop it in.
(GPS BEEPING)

35:00.478 --> 35:02.946
Well, what do you know?
It's already routed.

35:03.047 --> 35:05.277
What do you say we go get
ourselves some passcodes?

35:05.383 --> 35:07.317
Yeah, but if Hoss doesn't show
up, they'll abort the drop.

35:07.485 --> 35:09.476
Who said Hoss isn't
gonna show up?

35:14.526 --> 35:17.324
Okay, now, before we do
this, any questions?

35:17.429 --> 35:18.794
Why do I have
to be Hoss?

35:18.897 --> 35:20.330
Because you're good
at what you do.

35:20.432 --> 35:21.831
And why do I
have to be you?

35:21.933 --> 35:25.425
First of all, you will never be me.
And second of all...

35:26.271 --> 35:27.465
I forget your question.

35:27.572 --> 35:28.698
Okay.

35:28.907 --> 35:31.239
So it looks like we're dealing
with three guards here.

35:31.976 --> 35:33.068
PIPER: Then
it's three on three.

35:33.278 --> 35:35.303
Okay, so once we take
out the guards,

35:35.413 --> 35:37.347
Vicki will walk in
dressed as Hoss,

35:37.449 --> 35:39.178
and then we'll just,

35:39.284 --> 35:40.717
you know,
see what happens.

35:40.919 --> 35:42.477
MACGRUBER: You ready?
PIPER: Wait.

35:42.754 --> 35:44.449
Wait, so we're just
gonna wing it?

35:44.823 --> 35:47.314
Piper, there's a big
difference between winging it

35:47.425 --> 35:48.756
and seeing
what happens.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.088
Now let's see
what happens.

35:52.931 --> 35:54.899
No, thanks.
What?

35:54.999 --> 35:56.796
MacGrubie don't
play like Homey.

35:56.901 --> 35:58.869
And Homey don't
play like that.

35:59.204 --> 36:01.729
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're saying.

36:02.373 --> 36:04.637
I'm saying
I don't use guns.

36:04.843 --> 36:06.606
So it's true what
they say about you.

36:06.744 --> 36:09.212
Guns are for the weak.
Guns are for the stupid.

36:09.681 --> 36:11.171
No offense.

36:11.282 --> 36:13.682
MACGRUBER: Let's see,
what do we got in here?

36:13.885 --> 36:15.978
A piece of cloth,
a spool, a tennis ball...

36:16.287 --> 36:17.447
What are you doing?

36:17.555 --> 36:20.353
Making a little distraction.

36:23.194 --> 36:24.388
(MACGRUBER CAWING)

36:24.496 --> 36:26.259
What the hell is that?

36:31.169 --> 36:32.431
What the fuck?

36:49.454 --> 36:50.443
(WHISPERS) Now!

36:50.655 --> 36:51.679
Jesus.

36:51.890 --> 36:53.687
Now! Now! Now!

36:56.594 --> 36:57.561
Yes!

37:02.100 --> 37:03.863
I gotta admit,
that sort of worked.

37:04.068 --> 37:06.593
Sort of worked?
I just killed three bad guys.

37:06.704 --> 37:08.103
They're dead
because I shot them.

37:08.206 --> 37:09.537
Because they
were distracted.

37:09.641 --> 37:11.233
Okay, now,
piece of advice.

37:11.342 --> 37:13.105
When you use
the old celery trick,

37:13.211 --> 37:14.576
you're gonna wanna go
with the thick end.

37:14.679 --> 37:16.146
Seems counter-intuitive,

37:16.247 --> 37:17.612
but if you go
thin end first,

37:17.715 --> 37:18.807
it just slides right
out and you're...

37:18.917 --> 37:20.009
You're wasting your time.

37:20.118 --> 37:22.109
I'm never, ever
gonna do that.

37:22.554 --> 37:26.183
Never ever say, "Never ever.
" Okay, follow me.

37:31.863 --> 37:34.331
That's Constantine Bach
and Zeke Pleshette.

And if I'm not mistaken,
which I never am,

37:37.569 --> 37:40.936
that briefcase-carrying pile
of shit has the passcodes.

37:41.139 --> 37:42.697
All right, Vick,
it's go time.

37:42.941 --> 37:44.033
Do I really
have to do this?

Start walking.

37:46.878 --> 37:47.970

happened yet.

Look, you're
gonna be fine.

37:57.855 --> 37:59.447
This is just
like Nicaragua.

37:59.657 --> 38:00.919
I got shot in Nicaragua.

38:01.125 --> 38:04.117
Don't worry, this is
nothing like Nicaragua.

38:04.629 --> 38:05.596
(NERVOUSLY) Okay.

38:05.863 --> 38:07.330
Okay, I think I see you
through the window.

38:07.432 --> 38:10.401
Now just walk on in here,

you're Hoss Bender,

39:32.216 --> 39:33.342
Sorry.

39:35.053 --> 39:36.452
I peed them.

39:41.693 --> 39:42.853
Gross.

39:43.061 --> 39:44.688
I washed it.

39:44.896 --> 39:46.227
(WHISPERS) I didn't.

39:46.431 --> 39:48.160
Looks like this cell
phone's all we got.

39:48.266 --> 39:49.893
Then we better make
the most of it.

39:50.001 --> 39:52.401
'Cause at this point, this is
our only connection to the X-5.

39:52.503 --> 39:53.470
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

39:53.571 --> 39:56.631
Holy shit! It's ringing!
Vicki, call tracer.

39:56.741 --> 39:57.935
Call tracer.

39:59.677 --> 40:01.167
Set to jet,
MacGruber.

40:01.279 --> 40:02.337
Now remember, MacGruber,

40:02.447 --> 40:04.347
you gotta keep him on the line
long enough to get a location.

40:05.516 --> 40:07.245
Don't worry.
I've done this before.

40:07.351 --> 40:09.717
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
Hoss and Zeke are dead,

40:09.821 --> 40:11.083
and if you don't tell
me who this is...

40:11.189 --> 40:12.451
He hung up.
Did you get it?

40:12.557 --> 40:13.751
No.
Wow.

40:13.858 --> 40:14.950
Damn it. Is that
thing working?

40:15.059 --> 40:17.357
Yeah. But you gotta keep them on
the phone for at least 20 seconds.

40:17.462 --> 40:19.453
That was 20.
That was maybe three.

40:19.564 --> 40:21.429
Shit! You're right.
Shit, shit, shit!

40:21.532 --> 40:22.499
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:22.600 --> 40:24.431
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Second chance!
In your face!

40:24.535 --> 40:27.231
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
Hoss and Zeke are...

40:27.438 --> 40:28.666
That's my phone.
Talk to me.

40:28.773 --> 40:30.104
MacGruber, it's Faith.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.267
Colonel!
How's it going?

40:32.410 --> 40:33.434
What's the mission status?

40:33.611 --> 40:35.841
Positively banging,
Colonel. Right, guys?

40:36.047 --> 40:38.038
Oh, they're jazzed.
How's everything at the P-Gon?

40:38.149 --> 40:39.275
Well, we do
have one lead.

40:39.383 --> 40:41.112
You probably already
know about it.

40:41.319 --> 40:44.447
Cunth's having a fundraising
event at his mansion tonight.

40:44.555 --> 40:46.648
We do know
about Cunth's party,

40:46.758 --> 40:48.419
and we will be there
with bells on.

40:48.626 --> 40:49.957
Absolutely not,
MacGruber.

40:50.094 --> 40:51.391
Sir, I'm not
gonna wear bells.

40:51.496 --> 40:54.260
No, Mac.
You are not to enter that party.

40:54.365 --> 40:56.026
Right now, Cunth has no
idea you're even alive

40:56.467 --> 40:57.434
and that is a huge
advantage to us.

40:57.535 --> 40:58.524
Yes.

41:00.037 --> 41:01.664
This is surveillance only.

41:01.873 --> 41:04.103
I want to know exactly who
comes through that door.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.334
Is that clear?

41:05.443 --> 41:07.411
Loud and.

41:09.647 --> 41:10.875
So, Cunth is
having a party?

41:10.982 --> 41:12.415
Yeah, he is.

41:12.917 --> 41:15.613
And guess who just
made the guest list.

41:19.824 --> 41:20.950
Guess who just made
the guest list.

41:21.058 --> 41:22.423
Us?
Yes.

41:28.366 --> 41:30.891
For the record, I think this
is a really stupid move.

41:31.002 --> 41:33.937
MACGRUBER ON RADIO: Don't worry,
I'm gonna keep a real low profile.

41:59.230 --> 42:00.458
May I take your coat?
No.

42:00.598 --> 42:01.587
Your car stereo?

42:01.699 --> 42:02.757
Nice try.

42:08.105 --> 42:10.403
Okay, I think our
definitions of low profile

42:10.508 --> 42:11.736
might be a little
different.

42:11.943 --> 42:13.968
You think?
Where's Vicki?

42:14.178 --> 42:16.339
She arrived 10 minutes ago.
She's out back.

42:16.981 --> 42:18.278
I'll find her
in a sec.

42:18.382 --> 42:20.316
First, I got a little
business to attend to.

42:21.519 --> 42:22.486
MacGruber, come in.

42:52.550 --> 42:53.881
Jesus Christ.

43:34.525 --> 43:35.514
Where have you been?

43:35.626 --> 43:38.356
Sorry, I just took an upper
decker in the master bathroom.

43:38.462 --> 43:39.429
Upper decker?

43:39.530 --> 43:41.930
Yeah, it's where you take a dump in
the water tank and not in the bowl.

43:42.033 --> 43:43.762
You look great.

43:45.002 --> 43:45.969
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

43:47.038 --> 43:48.699
Look, Vick,

43:48.973 --> 43:51.032
I'm going to need you to poke
around, see what you can dig up.

43:51.275 --> 43:52.401
I'm way ahead of you.

43:52.510 --> 43:53.636
You see that guy
over there?

43:53.945 --> 43:55.435
I saw him coming out
of Cunth's office.

43:55.546 --> 43:56.877
I think he's one
of his goons.

43:56.981 --> 43:58.141
Which guy?

43:58.249 --> 43:59.375
That handsome guy.

43:59.784 --> 44:02.947
That guy?
You think he's handsome?

44:03.054 --> 44:04.783
Yeah, he's very handsome.

44:05.256 --> 44:07.281
Really? Well, if you
think he's so handsome,

44:07.391 --> 44:08.517
then why don't you
marry him?

44:09.193 --> 44:10.182
No, seriously.

44:10.461 --> 44:13.089
If you think he's so
handsome, go marry him.

44:13.197 --> 44:15.222
Leave the case.
Piper and I will do it. Okay?

44:15.333 --> 44:16.925
Is he that
handsome to you?

44:17.034 --> 44:18.092
Are you willing to
quit your job for him?

44:19.603 --> 44:21.230
No.
Good.

44:22.173 --> 44:24.038
Now that's the guy
I want you to check out.

44:24.875 --> 44:26.740
He's teeming with intel.

44:26.944 --> 44:28.002
What?

44:28.112 --> 44:30.307
Follow that guy,
and that is an order.

44:30.414 --> 44:31.711
And stay away
from that guy,

44:31.816 --> 44:33.340
who I actually would
describe as ugly.

44:33.517 --> 44:34.506
And that is
another order.

44:34.618 --> 44:35.812
So, two orders.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.217
Piper, you got
a location on Cunth?

44:37.321 --> 44:38.754
He appears to be
in the south wing.

44:39.256 --> 44:40.245
On my way.

44:41.158 --> 44:42.455
That guy.

44:47.231 --> 44:50.598
I will see your 25,000
and raise you 50.

44:54.905 --> 44:55.872
MACGRUBER: He's bluffing.

44:57.074 --> 45:00.202
I can tell by the look
in his beady little eyes.

45:00.745 --> 45:02.736
MacGruber.
We've been expecting you.

45:02.947 --> 45:05.108
Bet's to you,
Senator Garver.

45:09.453 --> 45:10.579
I'm all in.

45:11.188 --> 45:14.715
The Senator's
all in for $750,000.

45:17.895 --> 45:18.953
CUNTH: Call.

45:20.464 --> 45:21.931
Straight flush.
Damn it!

45:23.234 --> 45:25.759
My associate will assist you with
your debt, Senator. Good night.

45:29.974 --> 45:31.942
Sorry about that.
Really.

45:32.643 --> 45:33.803
I thought he was
bluffing there, so...

45:33.911 --> 45:34.900
Thank you, MacGruber.

45:35.012 --> 45:38.038
You just made me a teeny-weeny
bit wealthier than I already am.

45:38.149 --> 45:40.049
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something useful to do with it.

45:41.919 --> 45:43.944
Your companion's a very
beautiful young woman.

45:44.055 --> 45:45.044
Thank you.

45:45.156 --> 45:46.919
Hope you enjoy being
date raped, ma'am.

45:47.024 --> 45:48.013
This is my daughter.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.114
Hello.

45:50.628 --> 45:51.595
MACGRUBER: Sorry.

45:51.896 --> 45:53.591
He killed my wife.

45:53.964 --> 45:55.864
Will you excuse us
for a minute, please?

46:00.938 --> 46:02.303
Where's the X-5?

46:02.640 --> 46:04.267
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:04.375 --> 46:05.933
Where's the fucking
warhead?

46:06.043 --> 46:07.840
What would I want
with a nuclear warhead?

46:08.746 --> 46:11.146
(LAUGHS) I never
said it was nuclear.

46:11.248 --> 46:14.183
That's right, because most
warheads are filled with air.

46:15.820 --> 46:17.481
You know, I ran
into Zeke Pleshette

46:17.588 --> 46:19.112
and Hoss Bender
the other day.

46:19.256 --> 46:20.280
Really?
How were they?

46:20.391 --> 46:21.983
A lot less dead
than they are now.

46:22.093 --> 46:23.287
Oh, really.
That's too bad.

46:23.394 --> 46:25.055
Yeah, it's too bad for you.
'Cause they were a part

46:25.162 --> 46:27.187
of your little dream team
of thugs, weren't they?

46:27.298 --> 46:30.563
Oh, that's right. You got me.
Past tense. They were...

46:30.668 --> 46:32.465
Yeah, it's really quite
a sad story, actually.

46:32.636 --> 46:33.625
What do you mean?

46:33.737 --> 46:35.762
I had assembled the greatest
dream team of thugs

46:35.873 --> 46:37.397
in the history
of the world.

46:37.508 --> 46:39.032
I had them all
in one room,

46:39.143 --> 46:41.236
and I also had
some homemade C-4.

46:41.345 --> 46:43.973
And wouldn't you know
it, it exploded.

46:44.081 --> 46:45.241
And I lost them all.

46:45.349 --> 46:47.010
You're shitting me.
You're shitting me!

46:47.384 --> 46:48.783
Well, we have
a lot in common

46:48.886 --> 46:50.148
because I basically did
the same thing...

46:50.254 --> 46:51.380
Oh, no, wait.
That didn't happen to me

46:51.489 --> 46:54.981
because I'm not a fucking retard
who blows up his own dudes.

46:55.092 --> 46:56.150
Fuck you, Cunth.

46:56.327 --> 46:58.761
And by the way,
I have a new team now.

46:58.863 --> 47:00.626
Not only do I have
Vicki St. Elmo...

47:00.731 --> 47:02.221
Maybe you've heard of her?

47:02.333 --> 47:05.530
But I also have one of the greatest
young military minds around.

47:05.669 --> 47:07.694
I mean, this guy's
the real deal.

47:07.805 --> 47:09.170
And we're gonna stop you.

47:09.473 --> 47:12.169
Well, you certainly have a
healthy imagination, MacGruber.

47:12.276 --> 47:16.042
But I don't know anything about a
warhead, nuclear or otherwise.

47:16.280 --> 47:19.249
You're lying.
And you're a piece of shit.

47:19.350 --> 47:20.578
We're all done here.

47:20.684 --> 47:22.584
Would you show
Mr. MacGruber the door?

47:23.888 --> 47:25.822
Let me tell you how
this is gonna go down.

47:26.123 --> 47:27.818
First I'm gonna
kick you in the chin,

47:27.925 --> 47:29.790
breaking your jaw
in four places.

47:29.927 --> 47:32.191
I'm gonna take you and karate
flip you over my back,

47:32.296 --> 47:34.696
and then knee your nose into your
brain, killing you instantly.

47:35.032 --> 47:36.659
I do wanna get
a throat rip in here.

47:36.767 --> 47:38.826
I think that's gonna
be you, small fry.

47:39.136 --> 47:41.696
One thing I do know, at the
end of the day, Cunth,

47:41.805 --> 47:42.863
I'm gonna rip your dick off
and shove it in your mouth.

47:44.675 --> 47:47.906
And that is non-negotiable.
Who's first?

47:50.781 --> 47:51.748
Shit!

47:52.583 --> 47:53.743
My fucking back.

47:57.621 --> 48:00.021
You did not just do that.
That is a Blaupunkt!

48:00.357 --> 48:02.222
You owe me
a Blaupunkt!

48:03.427 --> 48:04.416
Where's Vicki?

48:12.570 --> 48:14.197
I'm not sure
I can do this.

48:14.371 --> 48:15.702
MACGRUBER ON RADIO:
Vicki, where are you?

48:15.806 --> 48:18.036
Don't do it for yourself.
Do it for your family.

48:18.142 --> 48:19.234
Vicki!

48:19.343 --> 48:20.310
GARVER: My family?

48:20.711 --> 48:21.939
Good night, Senator.

48:22.179 --> 48:23.271
Vicki, I just got
thrown out of the party.

48:23.380 --> 48:24.847
I got thrown through a window.
Shh.

48:24.982 --> 48:26.313
Threw my Blaupunkt out, too.

48:26.417 --> 48:27.384
And it's broken, and I'm really
fucking bummed about it.

48:28.919 --> 48:31.888
MacGruber, I'm watching Senator
Garver talk to Constantine Bach.

48:31.989 --> 48:33.889
Oh, well, I'm glad that
you're having so much fun

48:33.991 --> 48:36.186
checking out all the cute
guys at the party, Vicki,

48:36.827 --> 48:38.852
but there's a nuclear
threat going on

48:38.963 --> 48:40.794
and we could use all
the help we can get.

48:40.898 --> 48:42.388
So can you please
get out here?

48:42.499 --> 48:43.557
(SIGHS) Fine.

48:46.904 --> 48:48.235
First of all,
great party.

48:48.339 --> 48:49.601
Let's get that
out of the way.

48:49.707 --> 48:51.538
I loved the music,
I loved the dancing,

48:51.642 --> 48:52.768
the sushi, excellent.

48:52.876 --> 48:54.741
I particularly enjoyed
being humiliated

48:54.845 --> 48:57.405
by MacGruber in front of my
daughter and all my guests.

48:57.514 --> 48:59.607
By the way, does anyone
know how he got in?

49:00.217 --> 49:02.014
He walked in
the front door, sir.

49:02.419 --> 49:03.750
He walked in
the front door.

49:03.854 --> 49:07.312
I imagined there'd be a more
complicated explanation than that.

49:07.424 --> 49:08.391
Sorry, sir.

49:08.492 --> 49:10.687
Jeff, there's no need
to apologize.

49:10.794 --> 49:11.818
I appreciate
your honesty.

49:11.929 --> 49:13.760
Would you move a bit
to your left, please?

49:14.131 --> 49:15.098
Sir.

49:15.733 --> 49:16.700
Great.

49:19.737 --> 49:21.261
Anyone else feel
like being honest?

49:22.473 --> 49:25.965
Great, hang that in the foyer
and go kill MacGruber.

49:29.313 --> 49:30.211
Damn it, MacGruber!

49:30.547 --> 49:31.980
I specifically told you
not to go in there.

49:33.784 --> 49:34.944
I got him exactly
where I want him.

49:35.052 --> 49:37.885
Do you? 'Cause I think
it's the other way around.

49:37.988 --> 49:39.512
Agree to disagree, Jim.

49:41.191 --> 49:42.590
Look, I'm really
sorry, okay?

49:42.926 --> 49:47.022
"Sorry" is not going to keep us
safe from this goddamn warhead!

49:49.199 --> 49:53.135
Mac, you've turned
into a liability.

49:54.104 --> 49:57.801
And I have no choice but to
take you off this mission.

49:57.908 --> 49:59.739
And this time,
it's for real.

49:59.943 --> 50:01.934
But he has
the passcodes now!

50:02.046 --> 50:04.344
Because you couldn't
stop him.

50:04.448 --> 50:06.177
Jim, you can't do this.

50:06.417 --> 50:08.408
Oh, I can and I just did.

50:24.635 --> 50:26.830
I will suck
your fucking dick.

50:28.305 --> 50:30.170
I will let you fuck me.

50:30.574 --> 50:31.541
(SCOFFS)
I'm sorry, Mac.

50:33.477 --> 50:34.774
It's over.

50:39.883 --> 50:43.410
I can't stop thinking about that
envelope that Senator Garver got.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.420
I bet there was some
kind of a clue in there.

50:45.522 --> 50:48.457
It's cute that you're still
thinking about that, Vicki.

50:48.559 --> 50:51.187
But, trust me, there's
nothing to Garver.

50:51.295 --> 50:52.489
I have a feeling
in my gut.

50:52.763 --> 50:54.128
Yeah. Sorry.

50:54.264 --> 50:56.664
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

50:56.767 --> 50:59.497
Both of you guys have
just done a great job.

50:59.603 --> 51:01.400
If there's anyone
to blame here, it's me.

51:03.207 --> 51:04.071
If it's any consolation,

51:04.174 --> 51:05.698
being with you
the last few days,

51:05.809 --> 51:06.867
I've learned a lot.

51:08.045 --> 51:10.138
All of it was
what not to do,

51:10.247 --> 51:12.010
but that's an important part
of the learning process.

51:13.450 --> 51:14.883
I'm gonna go use
the ladies' room.

51:14.985 --> 51:16.179

or number two?

51:16.353 --> 51:17.684
Number none-of-your-business.

51:17.788 --> 51:19.312
That means number two.

51:19.423 --> 51:20.390
Shut up!

51:24.495 --> 51:25.621
So when are you
gonna make your move?

51:25.896 --> 51:27.227
What are you
talking about?

51:27.398 --> 51:29.491
Come on, man.
You can see it from a mile away.

51:49.219 --> 51:51.084
But I can very
confidently tell you

51:51.188 --> 51:54.180
that Vicki and I will
never ever be like that.

51:54.525 --> 51:56.322
Never ever say,
"Never ever."

51:57.094 --> 51:59.187
No, this time I can.

52:01.064 --> 52:02.964
After Casey, I made
a promise to myself

52:03.066 --> 52:05.626
that I would never be
with another woman.

52:06.737 --> 52:07.863
Must have been
really hard.

52:09.206 --> 52:12.198
Why did he do it?
Why did Cunth kill your wife?

52:12.376 --> 52:14.469
To this day,
I have no idea.

52:16.280 --> 52:18.180
We actually all went
to college together.

52:19.516 --> 52:22.542
Believe it or not,
we were very close friends.

52:24.455 --> 52:27.481
Then after graduation,
he got engaged to her.

52:28.892 --> 52:31.087
He asked me
to be his best man

52:31.195 --> 52:32.560
and right about
that time,

52:32.663 --> 52:35.325
I started banging her
and mowing her box.

52:37.034 --> 52:38.262
She was actually
the first person

52:38.368 --> 52:41.201
I felt comfortable
enough around

52:41.305 --> 52:42.897
to let eat
out my butt.

52:45.742 --> 52:48.040
Anyway,
shortly thereafter,

52:49.179 --> 52:50.908
she left him
for me.

52:51.381 --> 52:54.179
She was actually carrying
his child at the time.

52:54.885 --> 52:57.080
I asked her to terminate
it, obviously,

52:57.187 --> 52:58.711
so we could
start fresh.

52:59.156 --> 53:00.646
And she agreed.

53:03.126 --> 53:04.821
We were so in love.

53:06.497 --> 53:08.021
And he took
that from me.

53:08.799 --> 53:10.198
That's really fucked up.

53:10.667 --> 53:11.827
Thanks.

53:13.704 --> 53:15.797
You know,
you're a good guy.

53:16.340 --> 53:18.934
And I need to apologize
for something.

53:19.676 --> 53:20.665
No, you don't.
No, I do.

53:22.212 --> 53:24.077
I treated you so badly.

53:25.816 --> 53:29.411
I guess I just felt threatened
by you, believe it or not.

53:30.454 --> 53:33.014
And I'm not used
to feeling that way.

This is textbook Cunth.

I'm telling you,
Mac, he's clean.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.163
Yeah, as clean
as a pig dick.

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.097
Look, Jim, this has gotta
be some kind of distraction

01:03:49.205 --> 01:03:50.968
so he can
use the X-5.

01:03:51.074 --> 01:03:53.201

he's gonna use it soon.

he's gonna do...

I understand.
Or at least I think I do.

us some serious time.

Okay, I rounded
up this wrench,

01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:27.444
and I already have
this bottle cap.

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:31.042

for one large brown egg.

There are too many guys.
I need you to take two of these guns.

01:13:40.329 --> 01:13:42.797
I told you,
I do not use guns.

01:13:42.898 --> 01:13:43.887
Well, you better start,

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:46.160
because sticking a piece of
fucking celery up your ass

01:13:46.268 --> 01:13:47.292
ain't gonna hack it
this time.

01:13:47.403 --> 01:13:49.462
I'm not going to use a gun!
Why?

01:13:49.572 --> 01:13:51.597
Because

01:13:51.707 --> 01:13:54.073
I don't know how. Okay?

01:13:54.176 --> 01:13:55.438
I don't fucking
believe it.

Do you want
to save Vicki?

01:14:00.049 --> 01:14:02.142
Okay, okay.
So what do I do?

01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:04.151
You point it
and you shoot it.

01:14:04.253 --> 01:14:06.153

Did you see that?

I think I actually got him,
but you're doing a great job.

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:24.662

take those two guys out.

This is so much better than those
stupid fucking gadgets I used to make.

We gotta make a run
for that door.

just keep shooting.

We made a pretty
substantial Costco run.

01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:45.880
Might not be able to get food
for a while, so we got enough

01:16:45.981 --> 01:16:48.211
for, like, an entire
nuclear winter.

a lamb and take these two

gonna rip my throat out?

No, I want your throat
to stay right where it is

scream bloody murder

01:17:14.743 --> 01:17:16.768

01:21:56.425 --> 01:21:59.588
No. I cannot defuse
this missile.

01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:02.991
CUNTH: Bravo, MacGruber!

01:22:03.098 --> 01:22:05.191
I expected no less
from a washout like you.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.564
Once again,
I win. You lose.

01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:10.069
I didn't finish
my sentence, Dieter.

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:14.370
No, I cannot defuse your missile.
But I can do this.

01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:16.740
Launch commencing
in one minute.

01:22:16.845 --> 01:22:18.608

01:22:18.714 --> 01:22:19.703
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

01:22:19.815 --> 01:22:20.873
No!
A nuclear warhead's

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:23.577
not quite the same without
its thermonuclear core.

01:22:23.685 --> 01:22:25.209
CUNTH: Damn it!
(LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY)

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.015
It doesn't matter.

01:22:27.122 --> 01:22:29.249
There's still enough ammonium
nitrate left in that warhead

01:22:29.358 --> 01:22:31.724
to blow up the White House
and Congress, combined.

01:22:31.827 --> 01:22:32.919
Right again, Cunth.

01:22:33.028 --> 01:22:36.657
Of course, it's going to be
awfully hard to fly it without

01:22:37.099 --> 01:22:38.259
(CLATTERING)

01:22:40.102 --> 01:22:41.194
The guidance system.

01:22:41.303 --> 01:22:42.565
Weak!

01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:44.263
So I guess
you do win.

01:22:44.373 --> 01:22:47.171
And your prize will be
getting blown to smithereens

01:22:47.276 --> 01:22:48.868
in about how long,
Mrs. MacGruber?

01:22:48.977 --> 01:22:50.274
Thirty-two seconds!

01:22:50.379 --> 01:22:53.405
Well, we better scoot.
We do have a wedding to plan.

01:22:54.383 --> 01:22:55.350
Let's move.

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:56.576

Toodle-Ioo.

01:23:05.193 --> 01:23:06.592
MacGruber!

01:23:17.239 --> 01:23:22.609
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:28.672
five, four, three,
two, one, zero.

01:23:40.429 --> 01:23:43.193
Classic MacGruber.

01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:50.260
I love you both.

01:24:00.782 --> 01:24:04.309
PRIEST: Theirs is a love
that knows no bounds.

01:24:04.419 --> 01:24:06.512
A love that heals
in times of sickness.

01:24:07.289 --> 01:24:11.350
A love that forgives
in times of anger.

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.896
A love that loves
in times of love.

01:24:15.297 --> 01:24:17.390
Vicki wrote that.
PIPER: Hmm.

01:24:17.499 --> 01:24:18.466
It's beautiful, honey.

01:24:18.567 --> 01:24:19.829
Thank you.

01:24:19.935 --> 01:24:24.065
Now, is there anyone here with
just cause why these two souls

01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:25.969
should not be joined
in holy matrimony?

01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:30.637
(MOUTHING)
You scared me!

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:35.879
Bye.

01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:38.715
Then let's get to it.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.584
Do you, Vicki
Gloria St. Elmo,

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:44.352
take MacGruber to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:48.327
(SINGING) I do

01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:49.829
And do you, MacGruber,

01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:54.800
take Vicki Gloria St.
Elmo to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.329
(CHUCKLES MALICIOUSLY)

01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:03.973
No!

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:05.969

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:25:12.788 --> 01:25:13.948
Are you all right?
VICKl: I'm okay.

01:25:21.897 --> 01:25:23.057
No, Vicki, don't.

01:25:34.943 --> 01:25:36.171
I gotta admit,

01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:38.746
I'm kind of glad
you're still alive.

01:25:38.847 --> 01:25:42.078
'Cause there's something I've been wanting
to say to you for a long, long time.

01:25:42.184 --> 01:25:46.120
Hey, Cunth,
suck your own dick.

01:25:46.221 --> 01:25:47.188
Come and get it.

01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:54.687
What the fuck?
Where is it?

01:25:54.796 --> 01:25:55.888
(LAUGHING)

01:25:55.997 --> 01:25:57.760
It was blown up
in the explosion.

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.163
You are shitting me!

01:25:59.267 --> 01:26:00.234
Are we done here?

01:26:00.335 --> 01:26:01.666
God damn it!

01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:03.601
Are we...
No, we're not done here!
