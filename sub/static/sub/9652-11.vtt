<b>And finally, it's</b> <b>the
end of the school year,</b>

19:01.208 --> 19:02.943
<b>and that means yearbook time.</b>

19:02.976 --> 19:05.345
<b>I wasn't nearly as popular</b> <b>in
high school as I am today.</b>

19:05.378 --> 19:07.614
<b>That's why I asked</b>
<b>my Twitter followers</b>

19:07.647 --> 19:10.450
<b>to tell me what they would
write</b> <b>in my yearbook</b>

19:10.483 --> 19:12.285
<b>if this were nine years ago</b>

<b>KATS stands for</b> <b>"kick

19:57.364 --> 20:00.500
<b>not "kidnap a tiny seahorse."</b>

20:05.305 --> 20:07.440
<b>Because I was cool</b>
<b>under pressure,</b>

20:07.474 --> 20:09.009

<b>Naw, I'm kidding.</b>

20:10.176 --> 20:12.679
<b>I let 'em play with my B-hole.</b>

20:16.850 --> 20:18.552
<b>It's not about being cool.</b>

20:18.585 --> 20:20.520
<b>It's about being accepted.</b>
