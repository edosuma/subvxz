01:05.800 --> 01:09.800
Tom, come on up here and pack this thing.
Let's get going.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.200
I'll be right up.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Hurry.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.200
Okay, I'm gonna put some
of these things in your bag. Can I?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Okay.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
- Say, Helen?
- Yeah?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.600
I have everything packed but my sweater.
May I put it in your bag?

01:25.800 --> 01:29.000
You better leave it out.
It's a long ride back.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
- It gets cold around midnight.
- All right.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.200
Oh, we'll make New York by 10:30
if we get started on time.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.200
- Three hearts.
- Five spades.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.800
- Pass.
- Little slam in spades.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.000
- Pass.
- I hope you make it.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.800
Your ex-husband says he divorced you
because of overbidding.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.000
Yeah? Well, you take it from me,
my ex-husband's ex-wife divorced him

01:52.000 --> 01:54.400
because he sang in his bathtub.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.800
You ought to double six spades,
Dr. Bernard.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.800
Come on, Dot. Get hot. Step on it.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.199
Loosen up, Dot. Loosen up.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.000
This is a foxtrot, not an Australian crawl.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.600
Looseness is your specialty, not mine.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.800
No, no. Open your clubs. Open your clubs.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Hannah, will you attend to your dinner?

02:28.200 --> 02:32.000
It's all ready, if Miss Jerry'd come back
with the fish she promised me.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.600
I'll leave you the spades.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.400
Confound that daughter of mine,
she and Ted have been gone ages.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.800
Come on, Dot. Put more "uh" into it.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.600
Good gracious, Don.
You're dancing with me,

02:43.600 --> 02:46.000
not giving me an osteopathic treatment.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.800
Nothing personal, I assure you.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.200
And if you would take your mind off Paul
and concentrate more

02:51.200 --> 02:54.600
on your own left leg,
I think we'd do a lot better.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
We make it.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.800
Oh, Doctor, you should've played
your queen instead of the ten-spot.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.000
I'm sorry.
I can't keep my mind on my cards.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.800
- I'm worried about those two.
- Now, let's see here.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.600
- I wonder could anything be wrong.
- Dinner's ready.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.800
Oh, thank goodness, I'm starved.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Hey! Upstairs, there. Dinner!

03:14.200 --> 03:16.400
Come on down and let's eat.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.200
Will you please stop gazing at that man
and come and have some food?

03:27.200 --> 03:30.200
Blow the horn again.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.400
That doesn't sound like Jerry.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.600
Could be Ted.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.000
Oh, now look here.
You're taking this thing too seriously.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.400
I'm sure Ted was spectacular in college,

03:49.400 --> 03:52.200
but you don't go through life
on a lot of touchdowns.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.400
You wait a little while,
she'll come to her senses.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.000
I hope you're right, Doctor.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.600
You better come now, Doctor,
if you want to get anything.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.400
All right. Come ahead, Paul.
Let's have some dinner.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.800
My head's going round like a pin wheel.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.200
My heart's beating like a steam engine.
Feel.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
When did you first start
having heart troubles?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.800
From the first moment I met you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Then why have you been
holding out on me?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.200
Well, you see, darling,
I'm only a poor newspaper man

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
and we don't make much money.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.800
But from now on,
I'm keeping track of the overhead.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.400
And when I've saved enough money,
we're going to be married.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.200
You sound as if you were proposing
to my grandmother.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.200
What am I going to be doing
while you're saving the first million?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.200
Waiting for me.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.600
Waiting isn't my idea of the king
of indoor sports.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.800
I've no intention of waiting around
for three or four years

05:04.800 --> 05:07.200
while you harvest an additional crop
of wild oats.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.800
Now see here, darling,
I'm not as bad as that.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
No, but you're no Saint Anthony.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.800
You're just human, so am I.
That's why I don't want to wait.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.200
Jerry, you certainly say it straight.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.000
Sure. Isn't that the way we're going to be?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
Straight from the shoulder,
open, above board?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.200
Oh, you're a great girl.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.200
And you know,
you've got a man's point of view.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.400
That's why we're gonna make a go of it.
Everything equal.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.600
- You bet.
- 75/25.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
Shake.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.800
When will you marry me? Tomorrow?

05:45.800 --> 05:48.000
- Oh, gracious, no.
- Next week?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.000
- Oh, I couldn't.
- What, next month?

05:51.200 --> 05:53.400
Well, maybe.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.800
Oh, the first, Jerry, huh?
That's three whole, long weeks off.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.200
Oh, please the first, huh? Say yes.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.800
I won't let you go until you say yes.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.800
Say yes, darling, say yes.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.800
For the love of Mike, lady,
say yes so I can get out of here.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.800
You're not eating a thing, Paul.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.400
Buck up, there's nothing to worry about.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.200
I'm not so sure.
I wish you'd have a look for them.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.000
Right-o, Doctor.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.400
I know right where she fishes.
It'll only take a minute.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.800
- Well, for the love of Pete.
- No, for the love of Ted.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.600
Where have you been and why?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
Remember anything you say
will be used against you.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.400
Answer yes or no.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.600
I've already said yes.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.200
Yes.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.000
- Yes.
- Well!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
Hope you don't mind?

07:16.600 --> 07:19.200
Would it make any difference
whether I do or not?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.400
No.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.000
You rascal.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.600
- I'm simply thrilled. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.000
Hey, customers.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Boy and girl take big leap.
Hear it and weep.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.600
- Sorry, old man.
- So am I.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.800
- It may be possible that...
- Oh, it's all right, let's forget it, Doctor.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Attaboy.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.000
Well, aren't you gonna
congratulate me, Don?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Ted's the one I'm congratulating.
Lucky dog.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.400
And to think that you brought us together.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.600
My mistake.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.800
Why, you're not suggesting
that your slightly shopworn emotions

08:22.800 --> 08:24.600
were ever centered on me, are you?

08:24.600 --> 08:28.200
And why not?
You're a fascinating wench, Jerry.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.200
- Well, it's too late.
- Never too late to yearn.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
You'll never die yearning.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.400
Here we are.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.600
Great Scott, I thought you said a drink.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.200
Oh, it'll do you good.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.200
- A place for the future bride and groom.
- That's awfully sweet of you.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.000
Now, darling, I want you to eat something.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.400
Here. You two have a pickle.
It's good for those in love.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.200
- Mary?
- What?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.600
You're not ever going to marry, are you?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.800
- Is this a proposition?
- No, no. No.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Why not?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.600
Of course, you haven't a moral
to your back,

09:17.600 --> 09:19.800
but you're young
and good-looking and rich.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.600
Millions for defense
but not one cent for alimony.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.200
What a lot of heathen you are!

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
Oh, Dad, don't let them worry you.

09:28.200 --> 09:33.400
Anyway, Ted and I are gonna be married
and stay married, aren't we, darling?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.200
Yes, we're going to stay married.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.400
How unpatriotic.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.000
A man should be willing to lay down
more than one wife for his country.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.400
You know what time it is?
We must be on our way.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Got to pack that toothbrush.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.200
Got to take this on the run.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.600
I might stay here and finish this, darling.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.200
I want a great big helping of that.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.000
Well, I'm a big engaged man, you know,
I've got to eat.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.600
- Paul, I thought...
- Hello, Jerry.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.400
- We were just drinking to your happiness.
- Oh, thanks.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.600
And I was binding up the wounds.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.400
Never thought of myself, of course.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.200
Wounds? Nonsense.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.000
Why, Paul and I have always been friends.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
We're gonna stay friends, aren't we?

10:18.600 --> 10:21.800
I'm afraid so, Jerry.
I wish you all the luck in the world.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Of course you do.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.800
Hey, Romeo, are you packed?

10:31.800 --> 10:34.800
Coming up to finish, Juliet.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.600
I can't let you out of my sight a minute.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.600
Oh, you sweet darling.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.800
Soon you'll be wondering
how to get rid of me.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.600
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.800
Stop your fooling.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.400
You funny little man.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.200
- Here, time.
- Great!

11:13.800 --> 11:15.600
- Marvelous time, Doc.
- Goodbye.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.200
I had a marvelous time.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
See you at the wedding.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.600
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.800
- Doctor, we had a perfectly grand time.
- I'm awfully glad.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.200
Most marvelous party I ever attended.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.000
- See you in town, Doctor.
- Hey!

11:27.600 --> 11:30.800
Excuse me. You coming with me, Dot?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.800
- Try and get rid of me.
- Yeah, well, come along.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.800
Come on, we gotta get going.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.800
- Dorothy?
- Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.200
Listen, dear,
do you think Paul ought to drive?

11:41.200 --> 11:44.800
Oh, don't be such a crab. You'd think
you were my mother instead of my sister.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.200
Come on.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.200
See you down the car.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
- All right.
- Come on, darling.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.800
- There we are.
- Now, Paul.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.600
Hadn't you better let Hank drive?

11:54.600 --> 11:58.000
Oh, say, I'm all right, Mary.
I'm fit as a fiddle.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.600
- Is it all right with you, Dot?
- Anything you do is okay with me.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.200
There you are. Come on, let's go.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.200
- Everything all right, Paul?
- Sure, get aboard, Hank.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.400
- Come on, put your bag in there.
- All right. I'll do that.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.600
Wait a minute, Doctor.

12:12.600 --> 12:17.000
Did you remember to lock the cellar door?

12:17.800 --> 12:23.600
- Paul. Paul, please be careful.
- Who said careful? Let's go.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.800
Paul, please be careful.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.600
Paul, please drive slower.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.600
Oh, you hear me! Will you stop? Please!

13:06.000 --> 13:09.200
My God. They've turned over!

13:14.600 --> 13:17.400
Here, come on, boys.
Get my case, there.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
Oh, Mary.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.000
I'm all right. I'm all right.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.200
Dorothy! Oh, Ted, let me see her.
No, please let me see her.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.400
Well, I want to see her. I've got to see her.
Where is she?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.600
Oh, God, please don't stop me. Don't!

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
Dorothy!

13:35.200 --> 13:37.600
Oh, she's dead.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.200
Oh, she's dead.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.800
Father, she's not...

13:42.000 --> 13:45.400
No, no. She's still alive.
We must get her to the hospital quick.

13:45.400 --> 13:49.800
No, she's not, she's dead. You're lying
to me. Let me see her face.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.000
Mary. Mary, come up here.
Don't look at her.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.200
Oh, I never thought
it'd be so horrible, Jerry.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.600
- Just come away. Don't look at her.
- Oh, I hope she dies.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.600
- Jerry, I hope she dies.
- You don't know what you're saying, Mary.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.600
She was so pretty. I hope she dies.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.200
You! You!

14:10.600 --> 14:14.600
You dirty rotten beast!
I told you not to drive.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.600
I tell you, if you've killed my sister,
you'll pay for this.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.000
Mary, you don't know what you're saying.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Got drunk, just because Jerry
turned you down.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.800
You quitter. You rotten, rotten quitter.
You hear me on this, you'll pay for this.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.000
If you've wrecked my sister's life,
I'll make you pay for this.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.200
I'll make you pay for it.
I'll make you pay for it.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.200
Oh, that rotten beast!

15:38.800 --> 15:42.000
- With this ring...
- With this ring...

15:42.000 --> 15:45.200
...I thee wed.
...I thee wed.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.600
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father...

15:48.600 --> 15:51.200
...and of the Son...
...and of the Son...

15:51.400 --> 15:54.800
...and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.800
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.000
God the Father, God the Son,
God the Holy Ghost.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.400
Bless, preserve and keep you.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
The Lord mercifully with his favor
look upon you

16:11.000 --> 16:14.600
and fill you with all
spiritual benediction and grace

16:14.600 --> 16:17.400
that ye may so live together in this life

16:17.600 --> 16:21.400
that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.000
Amen.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.000
Well, it ain't my place to say it, Miss Jerry,
but if I had a boss that was so hard-boiled

17:01.200 --> 17:03.800
he wasn't satisfied with my working
all day at the office

17:03.800 --> 17:06.200
without slaving home at night,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.200
I'd tell him to go to...

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
The place he's heading for, and moreover...

17:10.599 --> 17:12.000
Thank you, Hannah.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.400
Have you got Mr. Ted's bag packed?

17:14.599 --> 17:19.800
Just going to. No offense is intended
and I hope none will be took,

17:20.200 --> 17:24.200
but if I had a husband
that went to Chicago

17:24.200 --> 17:25.800
on the third anniversary of his wedding,

17:25.800 --> 17:30.000
leaving me behind,
I wouldn't consider it natural.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.400
But he has to go, Hannah. It's on business.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.600
Well, I suppose so.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.000
Oh, Miss Jerry, if you don't
need me anymore,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.800
I've got a date to go to the second show
with the butcher.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.600
Are his intentions honorable, Hannah?

17:48.200 --> 17:53.600
I'm afraid they are.
He just wants to keep a good customer.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Ted.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.200
- Many happy returns.
- Same to you, darling.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.400
I brought you something.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.200
- Surprise.
- Ted.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.600
- Go ahead, open it.
- Oh, you darling.

18:31.400 --> 18:35.800
Just to remind you that you married me
three years ago today.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.800
Ted, you adorable,
extravagant wretch, you.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.600
- You must've robbed a bank.
- No, it belonged to my mother.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.600
- I had it reset for you.
- Oh, it's lovely, darling.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.400
- You like it?
- Mmm.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.200
It's to keep your wedding ring company.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.400
You dear. It's lovely.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.200
Will you think of me
every time you look at it?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.600
As though I didn't think of you
every second

19:08.600 --> 19:12.400
of every minute, of every hour,
of every day.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.400
You darling.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.200
- Gee, that's slick.
- You really like it, darling, huh?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
I'm glad.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.000
Did I ever happen to mention
what a wonderful girl I think you are?

19:29.200 --> 19:32.400
Well, not for a long time.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.600
I'd like to make love to you
till you scream for help.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.800
Can't scream.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.200
Three whole years
and I love you more than ever.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.600
That goes double, sweetheart.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.200
And every anniversary is going to be
just that much better.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.000
How long are you going to be gone?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.600
Well, not any longer
than I can help, sweetheart.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.600
But I'm afraid it'll spoil a week.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.800
I'll miss you like the mischief.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.000
A New York nightingale.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.200
No romance complete without one.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.200
Come on, you're going upstairs.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.200
Where do I go, upstairs?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.200
Yeah, up the stairs.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.200
Thanks, you're too much.
Oh, what a nice baby.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
Sure, I go upstairs. Come on, baby.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.400
I'm gonna take you upstairs.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
We'll make a nice time.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
make way for the wild and wicked wop.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.000
Thrills the ladies for nothing at all.
From the old country.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.800
What a man! He eats them alive.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.000
Hello, Jerry. How are you?

20:51.400 --> 20:52.400
Don!

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I love everybody.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.600
I am the great big lover.
You don't know what...

20:58.600 --> 21:00.800
Oh, what a grand, beautiful baby.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.000
Oh, hi!

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
All my life I look
for such a beautiful <i>bambina.</i>

21:06.000 --> 21:08.200
Hey, you bust up my big moment.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
What's the matter you?

21:09.400 --> 21:12.000
Come to me, I am the great,
big, Italian lover.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
Stop it, now I'm ticklish.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.600
Come to my arms, kiddo.
Come to my arms.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.800
Say, I come all to pieces.
What's a matter you?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.400
- Well, you can quit right now.
- Is that so?

21:26.600 --> 21:27.800
When he was a child...

21:28.000 --> 21:31.400
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about you. This is Janice.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.200
- I don't know your last name.
- Meredith.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.200
Mrs. Dickson Meredith.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.400
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Meredith?
- Just a floating grass widow.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.000
Floats them and gets them.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.600
Oh, please.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.800
We found her in a little restaurant
where we stopped off.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.200
She said she knew Ted and was lonesome,
so we brought her along.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.200
Hello, Ted.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.400
Hello, Janice.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
Well, she does seem to know you.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.400
You know Bill, Jerry.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.000
Oh, hello, Bill.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.800
You know Bill Baldwin.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.800
- I've heard of him.
- How are you?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.200
He owns Arkansas and Texas.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.400
No, no, wait. Only Arkansas.

22:14.400 --> 22:19.800
Listen, everybody.
Silence in the court, please. I rap for order.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.400
Oh, what a cranium.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.200
I wish to announce on this
happy occasion... How's that?

22:25.400 --> 22:27.000
I can't tell yet.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.800
Because of the excellent example
set by our young friends here,

22:30.800 --> 22:34.600
I shall, one week from today,
go tripping and blushing up the aisle

22:34.800 --> 22:37.800
with a gentleman from Arkansas.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Nice work, Bill. Congratulations.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.600
- And me, too.
- Much obliged.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.000
That's all right.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.600
Well, if we're going anywhere,
let's get under way.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.600
I'm sorry, Don, I can't.
I'm taking the late train to Chicago.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.200
- Chicago?
- Yeah, it's just one of those things.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.800
- Business, you know.
- Isn't that a shame?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.600
Jerry's going to be awfully lonesome.
You can celebrate without me.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.200
- Take her along.
- Why, certainly, I'd be only too glad to.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.800
That's sweet of you.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.800
Anyway, darling, we're all going
down to the train to see you off.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.400
- Aren't we, kids?
- Sure we are.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.600
- You'll be back for our wedding, Ted?
- Well, you bet you. I wouldn't miss it.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.000
Hey, let's do a little celebrating.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.400
Sweetie, out in the refrigerator...
Well, you know.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.200
- I got you.
- Make it snappy.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.000
Helen, I'm so excited
about you getting married.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.800
And me, too. I'm thrilled to death.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.600
Oh, don't get excited, it's all right.
I'll take them right off.

23:26.800 --> 23:31.800
My Italian blood, she is very excited.
I must sing, that's all. I've got to sing.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
All right.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.200
Hurry up, Jerry. Get the pennies.
Hurry up, get some more pennies.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.600
Hurry up.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.800
Hurry up.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.000
Hey, what you do...

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Ted.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.800
Say, what the deuce did you horn in
on this party for?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.800
I wanted to see the woman
that stood between us.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.200
Do you realize that
this is my wedding anniversary?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
It's not decent.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.200
Why haven't I heard from you in a month?

24:12.200 --> 24:15.800
- Conscience.
- You're not that old-fashioned, are you?

24:15.800 --> 24:19.600
Now see here, Janice.
I was plastered, and you know it.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.600
Oh, but you're not such a sterling
character when my arms are around you.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.000
- Be true to me in Chicago?
- Cut it out, Janice. Cut it...

24:36.000 --> 24:38.400
A little cramped for room, weren't you?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.600
If I could think as fast as that
I might have stayed married.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.800
Think of all the fun you'd have missed.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.200
Ted, you have a train to catch.

24:49.200 --> 24:53.800
- I hadn't forgotten, dear.
- Oh, really? Good.

24:59.200 --> 25:05.000
And some guests who are only thirsty.
I'm going to dress.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.800
- That gal's real opposition.
- Well, you're not. Get that straight.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.600
- Ted.
- Open that door.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.200
- Now, Ted...
- I said open that door.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.400
- Here we are, folks.
- The drought's broken.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.600
Tell Jerry to hurry, will you, dear?
We haven't much time.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.000
Yes, I'll tell her. She'll be out in a minute.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.400
- Excuse me, Bill.
- Okay.

25:44.800 --> 25:49.400
- You ready, Jerry?
- Just about.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.600
You know, it's a darn shame I've got
to get on that train tonight, isn't it?

26:10.600 --> 26:14.400
Yes, Janice and I will both miss you.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.000
Oh, now see here, Jerry.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.800
How do you like this little pose?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
Don't you think it's rather fetching?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.400
- Now, what are you driving at?
- Nothing.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.600
Except that Janice seemed
to be rather enjoying herself

26:35.800 --> 26:37.800
when I came into the kitchen just now.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.600
Nonsense.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.400
It was something in the way she looked
at you that made me want to kill her.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.600
Am I right, Ted?

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
Am I right?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.800
You know I won't lie to you.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Jerry.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
Then...

27:36.800 --> 27:39.600
She has a right to look at you
any way she likes?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.400
Now see here, Jerry.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.600
I'm sorry, darling. Of course.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.800
But there's no sense in over-playing it.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.800
There's nothing to it.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.000
Come on. Snap out of it.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.400
It isn't the end of the world, darling.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.200
Why gosh, I don't care a snap
of my fingers

28:11.200 --> 28:13.200
for any woman in the world but you.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.600
If I'd killed somebody, you'd go
all the way and back again for me.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.200
I'd ask you to try and forgive me
if I thought it was the right thing to do.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.600
But that isn't the point.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.600
Darling, you've got to get
a broader look at things, that's all.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.800
Well, you're out in the world
doing a man's work.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.400
Was that just a lot of talk
about a man's point of view?

28:48.200 --> 28:51.800
Please believe, me, darling.
It doesn't mean a thing.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.800
Not a thing.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.200
Doesn't make the slightest difference.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.800
Come on, snap out of it.
Now, pull yourself together.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.600
Yes, of course. We're...

29:10.800 --> 29:13.400
We're celebrating
our third anniversary, aren't we?

29:15.600 --> 29:18.400
All right, Ted, I won't spoil it.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.000
We'll think another time.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.600
That's fine.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.600
And that, too.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.200
We'll do that another time.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.800
What could've happened to those kids?

29:38.400 --> 29:41.400
Here, cut out the private farewells
and come on out here.

29:45.400 --> 29:49.000
Don't you realize that
we have a lot of catching up to do?

29:49.200 --> 29:50.800
Jerry's awfully upset, Don.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.800
Yes, I know, about your going to Chicago.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.200
Well, never mind. I'll cheer her up.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.600
There's nothing I like better
than taking care of lonesome wives

29:56.800 --> 29:58.600
who talk exclusively about their husbands.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.800
Come, come.
A little cheer for the departing host.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Here you are.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.000
Thank you. Here you are, Ted.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.200
- Oh, thanks, old boy.
- Not at all.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.400
Oh, sorry to have held up the party.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.800
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, there you are.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.000
Here you are, darling.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.000
Thank you, Helen.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the bride and groom.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.400
May they never be less happy
than they are at this moment.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.000
- Cheerio.
- Skoal.

30:27.600 --> 30:31.400
May we never be less happy
than we are at this moment.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
Why, Jerry!

30:42.400 --> 30:44.000
- What's the idea?
- What did you do that for?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.600
Just an old Spanish custom.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.000
- Come on, everybody, let's go.
- Get my coat, will you, dear?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Jerry!

30:51.200 --> 30:52.600
I always did like saying goodbye to husbands.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.200
Well, I guess we'd better be off.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.400
Well, that's all right. Here you are, Ted.
Here's your hat and coat.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.000
Now, you're sure you have
everything packed?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.800
You've got your pajamas, your toothbrush
and everything?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Everything set? Now, hurry up, come on.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.800
Well, well, come on, hurry up, Jerry.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.200
We've got to get some business.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.400
Hurry up, hurry up. Make it quick.
Hurry up. That's it, baby.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.800
- Oh, porter?
- Yes, sir.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.800
Porter, how long do we stop
at the next station?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.400
Long enough to telephone?

31:35.400 --> 31:37.800
Yes, sir.
If you ain't gonna talk to nobody too far.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.800
We're supposed to stop there
in about six minutes.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.200
- I see. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.200
Same old plight I've always
had with keyholes.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.600
You stick with me and I'll win this one.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.600
I'm going to invent a key
for leaping keyholes.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
- Thanks, Don.
- Don't mention it.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.800
- Nice of you to bring me home.
- Oh, it's all right, it's all right.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
Sorry to be such a nuisance
and drag you away.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.000
- Smarty, smarty had a party.
- And everybody stayed but smarty, I know.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.200
Yeah. Sure.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.600
What's the matter with you, Jerry?

32:29.200 --> 32:33.200
I'm just trying to hang onto the marvelous
latitude of a man's point of view.

32:36.600 --> 32:39.200
But I find I can't do it
and rub elbows with Janice.

32:40.600 --> 32:45.000
- What do you mean, Janice?
- Oh, don't stall, Don. I know all about it.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.400
Ted told me tonight.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.800
And I suppose I'm the last one
to find it out.

33:02.600 --> 33:07.600
Listen, how could any man
who ever held you in his arms

33:07.800 --> 33:09.400
be serious about Janice?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.000
I know, Don.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.600
It doesn't mean a thing.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.800
Ted told me that.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.600
Not a thing.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
Well, how could it?

33:22.200 --> 33:26.200
You're too marvelous.
You're a wonderful girl, Jerry.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.400
Thanks, Don.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.800
But nevertheless,
I couldn't stand the party.

33:33.800 --> 33:38.400
Oh, it doesn't mean a thing.
Janice? Not a thing.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.600
That's funny. Very funny.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.600
Let me in on the joke.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.000
It doesn't mean a thing, not a thing.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.400
What's the matter with me?

34:04.600 --> 34:05.800
Jerry.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.800
I'm sorry. You know, I can't understand it.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.600
Oh, come on now. Pull yourself together.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.600
Please, Don.

34:21.800 --> 34:27.199
Oh, now, darling. It doesn't mean a thing.
Not a thing.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.000
Now, now, now. There.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.800
Hello? Hello? Can't you get it?

34:41.199 --> 34:44.000
I know, but keep on trying,
will you, please?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.600
This is very important.
I've only got a few minutes, you know.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.200
There, there, there, don't you worry
your little head about Janice.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.200
Janice, my hat!

35:00.000 --> 35:02.200
Why, you're the grandest girl.
You got everything.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.200
Most wonderful girl in the world.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
Feel better now.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.600
Thanks for being so sympathetic.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.000
Been awfully sweet, Don.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.800
I guess I'm all right now.
You'd better run along like a good fellow.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.800
- Oh, somebody forgot something.
- What is it?

35:36.000 --> 35:38.200
- What's that letter?
- Which one?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.200
There's only one.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.000
Looks like a "J" when it stops dancing.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.800
"J" for Janice.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.600
I wonder why she left that?

35:52.600 --> 35:54.000
She took everything else.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.000
Oh, I've got to get out of here.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.000
I can't stand it. This place is haunted.
Come on, Don.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.200
Okay, where do you wanna go?

36:04.200 --> 36:07.200
Oh, anywhere as long as it isn't here
and I'm not alone.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.200
Okay by me.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.000
I got plenty of places to go
and lots of things to do.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.200
We'll go all the places
and do all the things.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.200
Jerry?

39:52.200 --> 39:53.400
Jerry?

40:09.800 --> 40:11.000
Hello, Jerry.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.000
Hello, Ted.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.800
- You'll upset a perfectly good breakfast.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.600
I...

40:19.400 --> 40:22.400
- I brought you something.
- Oh, how lovely, Ted.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.200
That's sweet of you.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.600
Well, aren't you going to kiss me?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.600
Well, I love you, so why not?

40:48.000 --> 40:49.400
Where's Hannah?

40:49.600 --> 40:51.000
Oh, she had to go to the dentist.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.000
That tooth that's been bothering her
for the last eight years.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.800
Oh, really? That's too bad.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.600
Nice trip?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.200
Oh, no, awful nuisance.

41:00.200 --> 41:03.000
A lot of big dinners,
and bald heads and double chins.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.400
You know, stupid.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.000
Too bad.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.000
- Smells good.
- Oh, this is great, Jerry.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.400
So, why didn't you answer the wires
I sent you?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.800
Oh, there was a lot to think about.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.400
And the longer you wait,
the more sense you get.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.600
You know, letting things ride the way
you did certainly whipped me plenty.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.600
Boy.

41:33.400 --> 41:37.400
You know, I imagined all
sorts of receptions when I got home.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.400
- This is great.
- You'll spill it.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.800
Well, believe me, I've done all
the spilling I want to do.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.200
Yes?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.200
- Anything new?
- No.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.200
Oh, Helen and Bill are going
to get married today.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.000
Oh, really?
I suppose we'll have to go to that.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.400
- I'm best man.
- Oh, yeah?

42:02.800 --> 42:05.400
And after the wedding tonight,
there's going to be a jamboree.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.400
- A get-together of all their friends.
- Thanks.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.000
Oh, gosh.
I suppose we'll have to go to that, too.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.400
Well, they'll expect us to.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.000
You know, it was our blissful example
that made them do it.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.200
Was there an overtone of sarcasm
in that remark, Jerry?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.800
Or am I looking for trouble?

42:21.200 --> 42:22.200
Hmm?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.600
No, Ted. Your cheeriness is amazing.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Well, what do you mean?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.600
You're like a little boy
that's stolen some jam,

42:30.200 --> 42:32.800
been spanked, and kissed,
and is happy again.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.600
You know, that's just the way I feel.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.400
You know, Jerry, darling,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.600
I was afraid of my life
we wouldn't hurdle this.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.600
Gosh, you'll never know what
an awful week I've spent without you.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.400
I can't live without you, Jerry.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.400
I never knew how much I loved you.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.800
Darling, please. Now, don't do that.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.800
Well, for heaven's sake, Jerry,

43:01.800 --> 43:04.400
you'll have to make up your mind,
you know, one way or the other.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.800
Gosh, I thought you'd already done it.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.200
Ted, let me understand something.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.200
When you say that being unfaithful
doesn't mean anything,

43:21.200 --> 43:23.000
you mean just that, don't you?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.800
- Well, what I said was...
- Yes.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.000
I remember what you said.
"It doesn't mean a thing."

43:36.200 --> 43:39.400
I wish I could cover up things
and forget them, Ted.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.800
I'll answer that.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
Hello.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.200
- Hello, Jerry?
- Yes.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.400
This is Don.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.400
I've been trying to get in touch
with you ever since...

43:54.600 --> 43:56.400
Well, for the last week.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.600
I understand Ted's getting back
in town today.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.000
I realize how you feel

44:02.000 --> 44:06.400
and I sympathize with all your ideas
about truth, honesty and ethics.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.800
I want you to give me your word
that you won't say anything to Ted.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.400
- Will you do that?
- No.

44:12.400 --> 44:16.600
For heaven's sake. Don't you realize
it will be all up with you if you tell Ted?

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
Perhaps.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.600
Well, if you won't consider yourself,
will you consider me?

44:24.200 --> 44:26.400
After all, I'm supposed to be
his best friend.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
And...

44:27.600 --> 44:31.000
Hello? Hello? Don't hang... Hello, Jerry?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh, Lawson?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Lawson?

44:36.400 --> 44:38.400
- Yes, sir?
- Find out what boats are sailing today.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.600
- Where to, sir?
- I don't care, the further the better.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.600
Yes, sir.

45:01.400 --> 45:04.200
What were you saying
when the telephone rang?

45:07.400 --> 45:09.600
That I've balanced our accounts.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.200
That's all.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.600
I didn't really intend to,
but that's how it is.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.200
I had to tell you.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.000
Don't look at me like that, Ted.

45:50.400 --> 45:54.000
- You don't mean that, Jerry.
- I'm telling you the truth.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.400
- Who's the man?
- Oh, Ted, don't be conventional.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Who's the man?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.600
I want to see him.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.200
Isn't it a rather good time
to remember what you said?

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
- That it doesn't mean a thing?
- Shut up, you!

46:20.600 --> 46:21.800
It can't be true.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.200
Why, I always thought you were
the most decent thing in the world.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.600
Can't be true.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
Well,

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
it is.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
I'm going to work, Ted. I'm late.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
See you tonight.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.000
Great party.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.000
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Hank.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.800
- Ted back from Chicago?
- Yes.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.400
Is he coming tonight?

48:08.400 --> 48:10.800
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since the morning.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.400
What's the idea?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.400
Well, you're a full-fledged
married man now.

48:19.200 --> 48:22.400
- You certainly have a fine girl, there.
- Sure.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.000
I hope you'll be very happy.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.000
We're bound to be, aren't we, darling?

48:26.800 --> 48:27.800
Say, let me tell you something.

48:27.800 --> 48:30.000
All you have to do
to get a free sandwich here,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.600
- is to wish them health and happiness.
- This is a private party.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.000
I understand all that.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.800
- Hello, Ted.
- Helen.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.200
- I told you they knew me.
- Yes, sir.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.800
- Hello, Arkansas.
- How are you?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.600
I'm sorry I'm late, Helen.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.600
Husbands should never be late. No, sir.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.600
You never know
who's sitting on the bench

48:51.800 --> 48:54.200
waiting to take your place
when you fall out of the game.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.200
Oh, don't be silly, Ted.
What made you so late?

48:58.400 --> 48:59.400
Well, I...

49:01.400 --> 49:05.600
- This little hand, you hand it over?
- Oh, pull yourself together, Ted.

49:07.600 --> 49:12.000
"I weep for you," the walrus cried.
"I deeply sympathize."

49:13.000 --> 49:14.800
I bet you haven't had any dinner?

49:15.000 --> 49:18.200
Dinner? No, I don't believe I have.

49:18.800 --> 49:20.200
You better have some food, son.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.400
I haven't seen my wife since
she welcomed me home this morning.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.200
Don't worry about her.
Have some food first.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.200
- We'll find her later.
- No!

49:28.800 --> 49:31.600
I'll find her. I'm all right.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.000
- Hi, Ted. Where've you been?
- Hello. How are you?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.000
What's the matter, Ted?

49:39.400 --> 49:40.400
Hello, Ted.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.800
- Help yourself, son.
- Help myself, huh?

49:49.800 --> 49:51.600
All right, I'll take the blonde.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.000
- I beg your pardon?
- It's all right.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.200
Ted.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.000
Look at the hero.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.600
Just a fool, that's all.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.200
There isn't a woman
in the world worth that.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Love, honor and obey, huh?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.200
Don't make me laugh.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.600
- Ted!
- Where's my wife?

50:09.400 --> 50:11.800
- Ted.
- Oh, there you are.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.800
Oh, so you're the white-haired boy, huh?

50:17.800 --> 50:20.000
Murderer returns to the scene
of his crime.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
- Ted, you don't know what you're saying.
- Wait a minute!

50:22.600 --> 50:24.000
But I don't know whether you are or not,

50:24.400 --> 50:25.400
but just for luck...

50:25.600 --> 50:27.800
- Ted, stop it. Cut it out!
- Let go of me!

50:28.200 --> 50:30.000
I'll go through this crowd like a high wind.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.000
- Ted, pull yourself together!
- Get away from me!

50:32.200 --> 50:35.200
Come here, come here.
Get him out!

50:54.400 --> 50:56.600
Does this mean
that you're leaving me, Ted?

50:57.000 --> 50:58.600
It's rather apparent, don't you think?

51:00.600 --> 51:03.200
Oh, don't let's make a mess
of things like this.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.800
Spoil our happiness.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.200
Happiness?

51:06.400 --> 51:09.000
Don't you think it's a little late
to talk about that?

51:09.400 --> 51:10.600
Well, you didn't think of that when...

51:10.600 --> 51:13.200
Oh, I see. You're going to put
all the blame on me, huh?

51:14.400 --> 51:17.600
Oh, Ted, no. I didn't mean to say that.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.800
Well, listen, I'm not the first man
in the world who's made a...

51:23.800 --> 51:24.800
Oh, Ted.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.800
Don't let's talk about men and women.
They do all sorts of things.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.800
We've got to live our own life, dear.
There's so much of it ahead.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.200
I'll never do anything you don't like.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.800
I'll never make you sorry, really.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.200
I'll forgive you anything, dear.
Can't you please forgive me?

51:57.400 --> 52:01.200
When I try to look ahead without you,
why, everything goes black.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.200
I love you, dear. I can't go on without you.

52:05.400 --> 52:09.200
Oh, you'll get along all right.
You've made a pretty good beginning.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.600
Oh, Ted, don't.

52:11.200 --> 52:15.400
We both made a horrible mistake
but that doesn't mean we can't try again.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.600
Try again?
With all our friends laughing at me?

52:20.400 --> 52:22.200
- Laughing at you?
- Yes.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.600
Someplace among the people
we know, there's a man.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.200
Maybe men, I don't know.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.000
But from now on, I'll wonder which one.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.400
And how many of them
are laughing at me?

52:34.800 --> 52:38.000
Well, couldn't I have said that
the day you asked me to marry you?

52:38.400 --> 52:39.800
Supposing I had said,

52:39.800 --> 52:43.600
"No, Ted. I'm afraid I may meet
the women that you've known."

52:44.000 --> 52:46.600
And why not? I waited for you.
You were my first love.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.800
But this is entirely different.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.400
All right, then,
but tonight I come back here,

52:50.400 --> 52:53.000
ready to humiliate myself,
beg for your forgiveness.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.600
Ready to forgive you anything
because I love you.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.400
And you say that's different?

52:57.800 --> 53:00.600
- You tell me your vanity is hurt?
- Oh, call it anything you like.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.600
Vanity! I'll never forget that.

53:04.200 --> 53:06.200
Let's not talk anymore about it.

53:06.400 --> 53:09.000
And I thought your heart
was breaking like mine.

53:09.600 --> 53:13.600
But instead, you tell me your man's pride
can't stand the gaffe.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.800
- Now, wait a minute, Jerry. Listen...
- No, I don't want to listen.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.200
I'm glad I discovered there's more
than one man in the world

53:18.400 --> 53:19.600
while I'm young and they want me.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.800
Believe me,
I'm not missing anything from now on.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.200
I don't doubt it.
Once a woman throws down her fences...

53:24.200 --> 53:26.600
Oh, print it on a motto and hang it
where Janice can see it.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.400
- Stop that!
- Oh, loose women, great,

53:28.600 --> 53:30.800
- but not in the home, eh, Ted?
- Cut it, do you hear?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.200
The looser they are, the more they get.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.800
The best in the world. No responsibility!

53:35.800 --> 53:39.000
Well, my dear, I'm gonna find out
how they do it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.800
So look for me in the future
where the prim roses grow

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and pack your man's pride with the rest.

53:44.400 --> 53:48.400
And from now on, you're the only man
in the world that my door is closed to.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.800
That is all.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.400
Counsel will prepare the decree.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.600
This decree is interlocutory
and becomes final in three months.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.800
Congratulations, my darling, you're free.

54:11.800 --> 54:14.600
You're exactly as you were
before you were married.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.000
Exactly.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
All I need is a complete set
of young illusions

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
and an innocent expression.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.600
Oh, cheer up.
I had a very good time as an ex-wife.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.000
Why shouldn't you?

54:25.400 --> 54:28.800
- All men are fair game.
- Yes, but I guess there's only one...

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Oh, nonsense.
I'll show you a flock of them.

54:31.200 --> 54:33.400
Friends of Bill's. They're as rich as mud.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.400
In a year, you'll have forgotten
the color of Ted's hair.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.600
- I hope so.
- My dear, I know so.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.400
All right, Helen.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.200
From now on,

54:46.200 --> 54:51.000
I take all the hurdles, see all the scenery
and listen to the band play.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.600
Come along.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.600
- Ted.
- Yeah?

56:05.600 --> 56:07.600
I just want to wish you a happy New Year.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.400
Thank you. Same to you.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.600
Don't let me keep you from your friend.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.200
Oh, I couldn't think of accepting
such a valuable gift.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.600
But, my dear, my feeling for you
is purely platonic.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.000
Really? I've heard of platonic love,

56:35.200 --> 56:37.800
but I didn't know there was such a thing
as platonic jewelry.

56:40.600 --> 56:45.800
My dear, Jerry.
You American women are so cold.

56:47.600 --> 56:52.200
Are you sure you can tell
whether a woman is cold or careful?

57:08.200 --> 57:09.600
I don't understand French,

57:09.600 --> 57:12.600
but I know the symptoms
of high blood pressure in any language.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.200
By the way, Jerry,
I see your husband around quite a lot.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh, yeah?

57:22.200 --> 57:25.200
Well, the next time you see him,
you tell him I'm still holding my own.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.400
I didn't know
you had a husband, Jerry.

57:28.400 --> 57:30.000
I had, but I haven't.

57:30.600 --> 57:33.800
Let's drink to his health, the infernal fool.

57:54.800 --> 57:58.600
When you have grown old,
you will be very, very sorry.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.200
Yes, I know.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.400
I shall most likely push back the gray hair,
curse at the wrinkles,

58:05.600 --> 58:10.000
and say, "You did not allow
the great lvan to make love to you,

58:10.200 --> 58:12.200
"and now look at you."

58:12.200 --> 58:16.000
Jerry, darling,
what you need is a great romance.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.200
Oh, one more would be the death of me.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.600
What are you doing in my train, anyway?

58:21.800 --> 58:24.000
International peace conference at Boston.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.200
Stop off a day or so.
It might amuse you, eh?

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Why not?

58:32.200 --> 58:33.200
Two reasons.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.800
One, I am, after all, a businesswoman

58:36.800 --> 58:38.800
on my way to a convention in Toronto.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.400
And the other reason?

58:42.400 --> 58:45.200
You are much too fascinating.

58:45.200 --> 58:49.000
Jerry, darling, I have madly loved you
for a year or so.

58:51.600 --> 58:56.600
What you feel for me is not love.
It's the call of the gorilla to its mate.

58:59.400 --> 59:03.000
Funny picture.
Ivan swinging through the tree tops.

59:08.600 --> 59:11.400
Oh, am I cramping your style?

59:13.800 --> 59:17.400
- I am serious.
- Oh, you mean you're proposing to me?

59:18.200 --> 59:23.000
Jerry, you are too clever to be provincial.
Much too clever.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.200
Do I not interest you?

59:28.800 --> 59:31.200
- Possibly.
- Tell me the truth.

59:31.400 --> 59:32.800
The truth?

59:33.600 --> 59:36.200
The last thing any man wants to hear
from any woman.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
That's a lesson I learned from my husband.

59:42.800 --> 59:45.000
And what you learn
at your husband's knee,

59:45.200 --> 59:46.200
you never forget.

59:47.400 --> 59:50.400
You shall not amuse yourself with me.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.600
Only the bell saved me. Come in.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.600
Porter, will you open the window?
It seems a bit warm in here.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.800
- That's all, ma'am?
- Yes, that's all. Thank you.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yes.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Why, Paul. Come in here!

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.000
Hello, Jerry. How are you?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.600
Oh, it's so long since I've seen you.
You should have a long gray beard.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.600
Not at all. I just happen to catch
a glimpse of you through the door.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
Oh, do you know...

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.000
Oh, how do you do?
I met you once at the press club.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.400
Yes, of course.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.600
Well, listen, what are you doing up
so late and so far from home?

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600
Oh, you are old friends, eh?

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh, yes, we're very old friends.
In fact, I'm the man she should've married.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.200
But that would have been
not so fortunate for some of us.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.800
Yes, I'd have been particular
about some of her friends.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.000
- I beg your pardon?
- Why...

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.800
Pardon me. I have so many things
to talk over with Paul.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.600
Will you excuse us a few moments, lvan?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.200
Just a few moments?

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.200
Look here, young man.
I've been bumped five times

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.200
between New Haven and Springfield
and it's got to stop.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Sorry.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.600
Rather dangerous playmate, isn't he?

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.600
Oh, well, perhaps that's
what makes him amusing.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.800
- Paul, I am so glad to see you.
- Then you haven't forgotten me?

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.000
Far from it.
In fact, I'm trembling like a leaf.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.400
You bring back so much, so suddenly.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.600
You've been trying to forget quite a lot,
haven't you, Jerry?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.400
- Who told you that?
- Oh, nobody.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.000
I've been around New York
most of the time.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.800
And heard the echo of my misdeeds
as I thundered up and down Broadway?

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.000
Why haven't I seen you?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.400
I understand several
were killed in the rush.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.600
Well, you don't exactly take the veil
when your decree is granted, you know.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.600
- So I understand.
- Oh, that sounds disapproving.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.400
What should an ex-wife do?
Spend her days doing good deeds?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.600
Going to bed at night with suitable books?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.400
Great Scott, Jerry. I'm not criticizing.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.200
Why, whatever you do,
as far as I'm concerned,

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.200
is all right, because you do it.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.600
That's sweet of you, Paul.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
Where are you bound for?

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.400
- Away from New York.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.400
Tomorrow will find me on my boat
in some quiet little cove.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.200
No office, no telephone, no neighbors.
It's good for the nerves.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.200
You ought to try something
like that, Jerry. It'd do you good.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400
Sounds wonderful.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.200
But not for me.
It's too late for that sort of thing.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.200
I've worked too hard and played too hard.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.000
I take my outings in the subway
and my exercise in the nightclub.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.400
I belong to the sweet, pure air
of 42nd Street and Broadway.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.000
Not you, Jerry. I know better.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.200
Well, don't let's talk about me.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.200
Tell me about Dorothy, Paul.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.400
Well, we're still married.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.400
Oh, just that?

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.000
I've heard your name quite often, Jerry.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.200
- From whom?
- Dorothy.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh, why?

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.000
She knows that I loved you, Jerry.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.600
That I always have and always will.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.000
My dear, you don't mean that.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.200
You're not going to tell me
that love is anything lasting.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.800
I've tried to forget that.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.000
Forever and a day, Jerry. And after that.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.000
I've made such a mess of it, Paul.
I'm so tired.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.400
Forgive me, Jerry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.000
I'm so tired.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.000
You brought back so much.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.200
Oh, I... I'm so fed up.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.600
I've made such a wreck of things.
Such a good for nothing mess.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.600
Well, what is it, dear. What's the matter?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.200
I'm just dizzy. I can't see.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.000
Oh, I'm not going to faint,

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.400
but I'm just...

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.800
Jerry, take it easy, please.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.800
It's all right, dear.
Oh, you mustn't let yourself go this way.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.200
Come on, dear. It's all right.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.000
It's all right, Jerry.
You're just worn out, you're tired.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's all right, Jerry.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.000
It's all right, dear.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.800
I'll see you in the morning.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.400
Oh, listen, old man.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.400
Jerry's pretty tired
and she's not feeling well,

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.600
but I think she'll sleep.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.400
So if I were you, I wouldn't go back.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.400
You assume some rights, do you not?
You are not her guardian.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.800
- No, but you're not going back.
- No?

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.000
- We shall see.
- I mean it.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.000
Good old American custom, eh,
minding other people's business?

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.400
What sentimental slop!
You are not protecting an innocent girl.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.800
- She is nothing more...
- Why, you...

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.200
That's another good old American custom.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.400
- Oh, porter?
- Yes?

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.000
There's only supposed to be one person
in Drawing Room A, isn't there?

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200
- Yes, boss.
- Well, see that's how it is. Get me?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.600
I get you.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.200
Did he hurt you, boy?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.200
Go away!

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.600
He's got a kick on him
like a Missouri mule.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.000
What are you thinking of?

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.600
Oh, how nice it is.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.800
And how much you can shake off
with just a little change in environment.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.000
Happy? You look great.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.200
I told you what a couple of weeks
would do for you.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.200
- Oh, it's been lovely, Paul.
- It's yours for the rest of your life, Jerry.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.800
- With my compliments.
- Thank you.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.000
Oh, Jerry,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.800
I have here the confirmation of my
appointment to the Far East from my firm.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.800
You like the idea, don't you?

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.000
If I can take you.
There's nothing anywhere without you.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.000
What about Dorothy?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.200
She'll be much happier, Jerry.
Our marriage hasn't meant anything.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.800
She's always bitter and morbid.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.400
Never lets me forget for a minute
the accident that disfigured her.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.400
Oh, well, you know.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.200
Poor Dorothy.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.800
It hasn't been easy for you either,
has it, dear?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.200
Oh, it's been fair enough, Jerry.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.600
It's just that it hasn't mattered very much,
but now things are different.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.000
I have this offer, it's interesting.
And most important, I found you.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.400
Dorothy'll give me a divorce.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.000
You and I can be married and...
And we'll be happy.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.400
- You think so, Paul?
- I'm crazy about you, Jerry.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.200
Always have been.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I believe you. I really do.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.400
They want me to spend
five years in Japan.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.600
You know, we can have a beautiful time.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.800
Leave all our mistakes 7,000 miles
behind us.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.200
7,000 miles.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.000
It sounds grand.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.800
We deserve a little happiness,
don't you think?

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.600
I think you do, Paul.
I think you deserve anything you can get.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.600
Beg pardon. Lunch will be ready
in just a minute, Miss Jerry.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.800
Good news, Hannah.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.399
- Nice here, eh?
- It's just heaven.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.399
Of course I ain't heard any angels singing,
but aside from that...

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.200
Well, we've got to eat anyway.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.200
Hey, come on.
Don't you know it's 4:00 in the morning?

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:48.200
The night is young
and we are practically children.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.399
- Hello, Joe.
- How are you?

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.600
How about a table for six?

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.200
Harry, table for six in the other room.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200
Right this way, please.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.600
I want four specials
and two orders of turkey legs.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.600
Oh, here we are. Right here.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.200
Well, isn't New York a wonderful place?

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.600
You go to shows and you see legs.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800
You go to restaurants,
and they give you legs.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.200
Don't laugh, Joe. It's a serious matter.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.600
- Don.
- Well, this is luck.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.200
Well, you old son of a sea cook.
I didn't even know you were in New York.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.000
I've been in Europe
for the last few months.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.200
Just got back.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.000
Well, you're doing a lot
of that sort of thing, aren't you?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.399
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.399
Same here. How've you been?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.000
Oh, fine. Lost my job yesterday.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.399
And I'm nursing
a pretty, little hangover today.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.800
- Outside of that, I'm great.
- That's tough. Anything I can do?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.399
No, thanks. I'll work it out all right.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.800
Say, it seems ages since I've seen you.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.399
Seen any of the old mob?

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.399
I suppose you heard about Jerry and me?

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.000
- Yeah. Too bad.
- Oh, well. That's life.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.400
Say, I'd like to get together with you, Don.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.600
- Fine.
- How about tomorrow?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.600
Tomorrow? I'm off again tomorrow.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.000
- Canada, for a couple of weeks.
- Really?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.600
- When I get back.
- Sure, if I'm here.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.800
- Oh, you leaving town?
- Yes. New York's bad medicine.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.200
A lot of things I want to forget.
I can't seem to do it very well around here.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.000
I know exactly how you feel.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.800
You see, I keep thinking
what a sad, little fellow I am,

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.400
and brooding over the man
that ruined my life.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.200
- What would you do if you found him?
- Kill him, I suppose.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.400
Funny, isn't it,

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.200
how one girl can be bigger
than all the tall buildings?

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.800
Well, I'll look you up.
When you get settled, let me know.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.000
I may start and never stop.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.400
That's my specialty. Well, so long.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.800
So long, Don.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.800
She'll be in any minute now, Miss Helen.
She knows you're here.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.400
- You going to Japan with them, Hannah?
- Oh, sure.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.800
I want to see where the money's gone.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.600
I've gave to foreign missions
for the heathen.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.400
How soon are they starting?

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.600
Oh, I forget you've been honeymooning
so long you don't know anything.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.600
His wife's going to let him loose.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.000
It'll be soon, now.
Miss Jerry's gave up her job.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.000
Really? She's resigned?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.800
And her firm come right back with an offer
of $7,500 a year to go to London.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.800
- They have branches in Europe.
- Hooray for Jerry.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.200
Personally, I'd a darn sight rather go
to London than to Yokohokohamie.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.800
- Hello there, darling!
- Jerry.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.800
Well, globetrotter bride
and what have you.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.600
Hello, yourself, you stormy petrel.
It's about time I came back.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.400
Gee whiz, but I'm glad to see you.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.200
Say, I've missed you
like the dickens, Helen.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.200
You, getting yourself out of one upheaval
into another all the time.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400
Let me take a look at you.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.000
Better be careful, darling.
My sea legs are still wobbly.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.400
Now tell me, are you happy?

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.600
Yes, sure. Bill's a big shot in his way.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.200
He stands without hitching.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.400
Nice and secure, eh?

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.000
Yes, but... That other business.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You know, when you stand at the altar
with someone you're wild about

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.200
and the organ makes you dizzy
and you say,

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.000
"This is heaven and we'll last forever."

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.600
Of course, that's gone forever.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.200
- I wish you hadn't said that, Helen.
- But why?

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.000
Well, that brings my leaping mind
back to its big news.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.000
Big news?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600
We ran across Ted.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.800
- Where?
- In Paris. Saw quite a lot of him.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.200
What's he doing?

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.800
Trying to wreck a fairly good mind
and an A-1 body.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800
Really?

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.400
He's doing newspaper work,
for the time being.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.000
Of course, it won't last.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.000
Ask about me?

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.600
My dear, he hates you so hard,
I think he's still mad about you.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.000
Oh, no, he's not.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.600
Making a fool of himself, eh?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.800
Oh, well, you know what
Americans do in Paris.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.000
When they meet someone
who speaks American and knows Paris.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.800
Ted was taking bets to see
how many nights in succession

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800
he could stay drunk
without spending a cent for it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
He'd gone six weeks when we started.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.800
You know, Bill's been crazy about him
ever since he broke up our wedding party.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.800
It seems in the West
where men are so and so,

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.000
that, that's considered
a pretty good piece of work.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.600
Well, anyhow,
I've been busting to tell you.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.400
What a girl.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.600
The lad I divorced is married again,
has a baby

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.000
and arrives in Wall Street
every morning at 9:00.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.200
Helen!

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, I guess that's Paul now.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.200
- He'll be delighted to see you, Helen.
- I'll be very glad to see him.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.200
It's Dorothy, Jerry.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.200
Oh, yes, of course. Come in, Dorothy.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.600
I suppose I should have called you
and made a date.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.800
Well, for heaven's sake, Dorothy.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.400
Hello, Helen. I hear you've married again.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.800
Yes, a big cattle and horse man.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.800
Thanks for the tea, darling.
I must be going.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.000
Buffalo Bill is waiting.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.800
- I hope I didn't interrupt.
- Oh, no, not at all.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.800
We're at the Ritz, dear.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.400
Why don't you come over
and have dinner with us?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.800
Sorry, I have a date for dinner.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.600
- Helen!
- Hello, Paul.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.400
Hello. Well, Jerry...

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.400
If anything happens to your date, dear,
come on over.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.600
Thanks.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.600
- Goodbye, Paul, see you later.
- Goodbye, Helen.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.600
- Have some tea, Paul, won't you?
- No, thanks, Jerry.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.600
Well, Dot, what are you doing here?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.600
I just wanted to see Jerry
for a few minutes.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.000
What did you want to say to her?

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.400
I guess I was going to ask her
not to take you from me.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.000
But I've told you that Jerry has
no responsibility in the matter, Dot.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.400
I thought that everything was all settled.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.600
And besides, you said that we...

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.400
I know I said I'd set you free.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.800
When you told me, my pride revolted
at holding you against your will.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.800
But now that I've had time to think it over,
I have no pride, Paul.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.200
Maybe our marriage hasn't meant much,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.400
but there's nothing at all without it.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.200
It does give me an excuse for living,
being married to you.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.400
- There isn't anything else.
- Wait a minute, Dot.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.600
You know that I'm not planning
to desert you.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.000
I've made certain definite arrangements
to take care of you.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.400
And that's everything in the world
I have for you, my dear.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.800
I have a right to a chance at some kind
of personal life, haven't I?

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.400
Like anyone else?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.200
Well, how about it, Dot?

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.200
Just a minute.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.800
- Can't we talk afterwards?
- I'm afraid not.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I'm afraid she's right, Paul.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.000
I couldn't do it.
I wouldn't dare expect to be happy.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.400
Please, Paul, it hit me.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400
It brought back something.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.800
Devastation just like this.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.400
Only I deserved it.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.000
Let me say it, Paul.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.200
She married the man she loved. So did I.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.600
Every woman does, if she can.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.800
But Dorothy is just trying to hang on.
I didn't.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.800
I see my way. I see it so clearly now, Paul.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.200
I've never given my word
and broken it before, except once.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.600
And that was the promise I made
on the altar with all my heart and soul.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.600
Jerry I... This is just a storm.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.400
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, please.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.000
You've saved us both
from a horrible mistake.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.400
I'm really grateful.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.800
This is right, Paul, and in our hearts
we've known it, haven't we?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.000
Marriage is the one thing in the world
I thought ought to be perfect.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.200
Nothing else is.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.400
And when mine wasn't, I quit.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.400
I don't know whether Ted could ever
give me another chance.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.000
But wherever he is, I'm going to find him

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.800
and find out.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.200
Jerry, if Ted doesn't come here,

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.000
we'll go over to Zelly's.
We may find him there.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
We'll wait a while, Hank.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.400
What do you think he'll do
when he finds you're in Paris?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.400
Who can tell?

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.800
Why, there he is now!

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.800
- Is he alone?
- No.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.000
Quite a party.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.200
Jerry, don't you want to talk to him?

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.200
- Hank, will you take me over there?
- Why, certainly, Jerry.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.400
Ted! Come on, Ted. Come on.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800
- Ted!
- Jerry!

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.000
What are you doing here?

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.400
Surprised?

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.600
Well, I thought when I put
the Atlantic Ocean between us,

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.000
I wouldn't be seeing you.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.400
You should have found a wider ocean.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.000
Don't you think it would be more Christian
if you'd give me a chance to forget you?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.600
Do you still hate me that much, Ted?

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400
Where's your husband?

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.600
Oh, he's not far away.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.400
You do keep track of me, don't you?

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:20.000
That's why I left New York,
because I couldn't think of anything else.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.600
I'm still a little groggy, Jerry,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
but with time out I think I'll be able
to finish the game.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.000
You deserve the best in the world, Ted.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.800
There's no one that wishes it
for you more than I do.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.400
Sure, I know.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.000
And there's no reason on Earth
why we can't still be friends.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.800
No, of course not.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.600
I hope that, that other fellow gives you
the break you deserve.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.200
I certainly didn't.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.400
Well, here's everything, Jerry.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.400
And happy New Year.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.400
I'm working in London, Ted.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.400
This is the third time I've been in Paris
looking for you.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.800
- For me?
- Yes.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.200
Why?

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.400
You see, I had to leave New York, too.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.400
Couldn't forget that little church
and a lot of other things.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.400
You're the only husband I've ever had
and ever want.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.800
It's New Year in a minute, Ted.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.600
All the world gets a new chance.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:32.200
Don't kid me, Jerry.
I'd give my right arm for another chance.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.800
I like that right arm.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.600
How about putting it around me?

01:21:39.305 --> 01:21:45.825
