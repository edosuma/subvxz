00:10.400 --> 00:12.523
You're in a pretty good mood tonight.

00:12.652 --> 00:14.276
Why not?

00:14.403 --> 00:17.819
l was up till two in the morning
finishing off Kierkegaard.

00:17.948 --> 00:20.106
l hope he thanked you for it.

00:22.786 --> 00:24.862
l see Coach and George
are still at it.

00:24.996 --> 00:28.495
Yeah. lt's kind of fun.
They enjoy each other's company.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.867
lt's nice to have someone
your own age to spend time with.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.417
You've been through the same fads.
You don't have to explain things.

00:37.549 --> 00:41.877
- There's a real comfort in that.
- Too bad we're not closer in age.

00:44.847 --> 00:47.088
lsn't it?

00:47.224 --> 00:49.975
However, six or seven years
really isn't that much.

00:50.101 --> 00:52.770
l would have thought eight or nine.

00:53.854 --> 00:58.599
- l find older men stimulating.
- l hope you're not talking about me.

00:58.734 --> 01:02.601
Certainly not. You're not
in the least bit stimulating.

01:04.447 --> 01:07.282
Listen. Seriously,
l would not worry about your age.

01:07.408 --> 01:12.069
You're obviously young enough to
bring that Kierkegaard fellow home.

01:12.204 --> 01:15.121
Do you two think that
you could put your glands on hold

01:15.248 --> 01:18.533
long enough
to get some work done here?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.981 --> 02:34.104
You win again, George.

02:34.233 --> 02:38.361
l just had all the cards today,
Coach. You'll get me tomorrow.

02:38.487 --> 02:40.859
You bet l will. Take it easy, pal.

02:42.115 --> 02:45.863
Always do. See you, pal.
See you, folks.

02:45.993 --> 02:47.073
- Take care.
- Bye.

02:47.203 --> 02:50.702
Sam, can l borrow
20 bucks till payday?

02:50.831 --> 02:53.037
You bet.

02:53.166 --> 02:56.831
- Boy, was that George hot!
- l didn't know you played for money.

02:56.961 --> 02:59.630
Every day for months.

03:00.631 --> 03:04.415
- How many games have you won?
- lf l had to guess, let me see...

03:05.385 --> 03:06.844
None.

03:07.387 --> 03:08.169
None?

03:08.304 --> 03:11.755
Sam,
l've been right in there every game.

03:11.891 --> 03:16.351
- Coach, that guy's a hustler.
- George and me, we're like pals.

03:16.478 --> 03:18.850
That's how they operate. Trust me.

03:18.980 --> 03:22.764
- We're only playing for fun.
- How much fun have you lost?

03:22.900 --> 03:26.103
- About eight grand.
- Eight grand?

03:26.904 --> 03:30.818
That's spread over
since last February.

03:31.992 --> 03:37.661
Don't you see what he's doing? He's
taking you for everything you got.

03:37.788 --> 03:39.413
l can't believe it.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.955
Sam, you are at least six or seven
years older than l am. Admit it.

03:43.085 --> 03:44.460
Wait a second.

03:44.586 --> 03:48.797
We just discovered George has been
hustling Coach for a lot of money.

03:48.923 --> 03:53.003
George? That sweet,
white-haired gentleman?

03:53.135 --> 03:56.420
- Piffle.
- No, Diane, it's true.

03:57.681 --> 04:00.302
Sam, isn't there anything
we can do about it?

04:00.433 --> 04:05.593
l got it. We beat him up, strip him,
take his money and put him on a bus.

04:08.607 --> 04:12.106
- Subtle, Carla.
- That's how l got to Boston.

04:18.656 --> 04:20.982
l just had the worst idea
l've ever had.

04:21.118 --> 04:26.242
- Worse than hiring her?
- The second worst idea.

04:26.372 --> 04:28.412
Remember Harry?

04:29.041 --> 04:31.532
Maybe he could help us out here.

04:31.669 --> 04:35.713
You mean that hustler
you're always throwing out?

04:35.839 --> 04:38.709
That's like calling Spinoza
to settle an argument

04:38.841 --> 04:41.546
between Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.

04:44.096 --> 04:46.135
She's got a point there, Sam.

04:49.934 --> 04:53.018
Look, l think
it's a mistake to trust Harry.

04:53.146 --> 04:57.854
George is a con men. Harry's
a con man. What's the old saying?

04:57.983 --> 05:00.556
- ''Send a thief...''
- ''To camp for the summer.''

05:02.779 --> 05:05.020
l don't even know where to find him.

05:05.156 --> 05:09.698
l know exactly where he is.
ln jail, like he always is.

05:09.827 --> 05:11.866
You sure?

05:15.540 --> 05:19.158
ln Boston, for the city jail.
Sure you don't mind me doing this?

05:19.293 --> 05:23.290
No, go ahead. l use lnformation
to get numbers all the time.

05:32.388 --> 05:34.012
Coach.

05:34.974 --> 05:37.429
- Hi, Harry.
- Harry...

05:40.145 --> 05:43.893
..Here's the 1 0 bucks l'm gonna owe
you in about five minutes.

05:45.733 --> 05:48.188
Thanks. Coach, where's Sam?

05:48.318 --> 05:51.153
- He'll be out in a minute.
- Wanna play for a drink?

05:51.279 --> 05:53.106
Not a chance, Harry. No way.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.119
Don't show fear.

06:04.749 --> 06:06.789
He smells fear.

06:07.669 --> 06:10.338
Cliff. You feel lucky?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.421
- Sure. Why?
- Tell you what.

06:13.549 --> 06:17.795
l'll bet you a dime l can drink
that drink without touching the hat.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.837
A dime?

06:21.973 --> 06:24.463
- OK. You're on.
- You'll love this.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.564
lt's gone.

06:50.497 --> 06:54.495
What's so good about that?
Anybody can do that. l can do that.

06:54.626 --> 06:57.330
- No.
- A dime?

06:57.462 --> 06:59.501
Coach, another shot, please.

07:00.715 --> 07:05.293
A dime says l can drink the old shot
without touching the old <i>chapeau.</i>

07:07.804 --> 07:11.636
Are you ready? l'll be right back.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.436
OK, that baby's gone.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.148
That's great, Cliff.
That's worth a dime.

07:34.452 --> 07:37.121
You can laugh,
but at least l got my money back.

07:37.246 --> 07:39.654
Five bucks for the booze, Cliffo.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.500
- Thanks, Cliff.
- Any time, Harry.

07:44.628 --> 07:46.288
What's the matter?

07:46.421 --> 07:49.587
lf you gave as much to the
space programme as you have to him,

07:49.716 --> 07:52.171
we'd have condos on Venus.

07:53.135 --> 07:55.708
Thank you for coming.
Can l get you a drink?

07:55.846 --> 07:59.012
- For free is too easy.
- Let's go sit down over there.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.975
Coach, you wanna join us?
Carla, you got the bar?

08:03.019 --> 08:06.518
She always gets to watch the bar.

08:06.647 --> 08:09.517
- Diane, you may have the bar.
- Goody.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.272
Diane has the bar.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.863
- Yes?
- l need a Bloody Mary.

08:22.994 --> 08:25.450
A Bloody Mary coming up.

08:26.581 --> 08:28.620
Where do we keep the Mary?

08:31.168 --> 08:33.207
''The Bartender's Guide.''

08:35.964 --> 08:37.244
''The Bloody Mary.''

08:37.381 --> 08:41.164
''There's nothing like a fresh
Bloody Mary to start any day.''

08:41.302 --> 08:44.219
''A traditional favourite
served with lunch, brunch,

08:44.346 --> 08:47.133
and often as the
'hair of the dog that bit you'.''

08:47.265 --> 08:51.049
- ''lts name derives from...''
- Make the drink!

08:54.397 --> 08:59.438
That's Eddie the Mole from Phoenix.
They call him Mole Man, or Moley.

08:59.568 --> 09:01.893
- ln Philly they call him Sid.
- Sid?

09:02.028 --> 09:04.566
Philly's a dull town.

09:06.574 --> 09:09.528
So, what you're saying
is he's pretty well-known?

09:09.660 --> 09:12.447
Any bird-dogger knows him.
He runs paper and cubes,

09:12.579 --> 09:15.200
mainly in the crib,
sometimes up against the wall.

09:15.332 --> 09:17.620
Puts on a straight-up-guy front,

09:17.750 --> 09:20.537
and then grinds away slow
with coolers and hop toads,

09:20.669 --> 09:22.578
real rip and tear kind of stuff.

09:23.047 --> 09:25.039
Yeah. That sounds like him.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.791
lt seems to me he got in trouble
with the boys in Vegas last year.

09:28.927 --> 09:31.880
He's been keeping a low profile.
Could be him.

09:32.013 --> 09:35.595
A lot of those guys lay low
by making small money off dumb saps.

09:35.724 --> 09:37.764
So where do l come in?

09:39.895 --> 09:42.930
Sam, excuse me. Where do you keep
the measuring spoons?

09:43.564 --> 09:46.435
- We don't have any.
- What?

09:47.526 --> 09:51.654
''Precise measurements are one of
the keys to a good drink.'' Page 1 2.

09:51.780 --> 09:55.528
Serving it the same day it's ordered
is right up there, too.

09:57.910 --> 09:58.692
Carla,...

09:58.828 --> 10:01.069
Girls, please.

10:03.582 --> 10:06.369
C'mon, Harry.
You got anything? You got any ideas?

10:06.501 --> 10:11.874
l think you need a poker game.
The Mole is not known for poker.

10:12.006 --> 10:15.706
Call him and tell him you have
a little game going here at closing.

10:15.842 --> 10:19.377
That makes you the roper.
You bring him into the game.

10:19.512 --> 10:23.556
How do we know that he brings
enough money to cover Coach's losses?

10:23.683 --> 10:27.265
The guys always carry a big roll.
They gotta be ready for action.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.597
You have to promote this
as a friendly neighbourhood game.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.806
- You're the inside man.
- With you so far.

10:32.941 --> 10:36.391
- l'm gonna need a bankroll.
- You just lost me.

10:36.527 --> 10:39.860
Sam, if you don't stake me,
it doesn't go down.

10:39.988 --> 10:43.820
- l need about five grand.
- Five grand? Are you kidding me?

10:43.950 --> 10:46.867
This whole thing's
getting out of hand.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.112
Sam, please.

10:52.875 --> 10:56.872
Alright. l'll be the... What d'you
call the guy who brings the money?

10:57.003 --> 10:59.708
You call him the guy
who brings the money.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.332
One other thing, Sam.

11:07.304 --> 11:11.218
- l appreciate this.
- l appreciate getting bailed out.

11:11.933 --> 11:16.096
Besides, l don't like the idea of
somebody else plucking my pigeons.

11:16.228 --> 11:18.304
See ya.

11:18.438 --> 11:20.478
Thanks, Sam.

11:26.445 --> 11:28.485
''A dash of pepper.''

11:29.907 --> 11:32.148
A lot of ingredients
in a Bloody Mary.

11:32.284 --> 11:37.194
That's why we usually mix up five
gallons and put it in the fridge.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.488
Carla, why'd you let her do it?

11:39.623 --> 11:42.707
l wanted to see her
try and make vodka.

11:51.634 --> 11:56.509
- Closing time.
- Sammy, let me get this straight.

11:56.638 --> 11:58.844
Whatever we lose,
we're gonna get back.

11:58.974 --> 12:01.262
- That's right.
- Great.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.634
l love to gamble without risk.

12:05.604 --> 12:08.890
Sam, would you mind
if l stay and watch?

12:09.024 --> 12:12.439
l promise l won't ask
a bunch of dumb questions.

12:12.569 --> 12:15.522
- You won't even know l'm here.
- OK.

12:17.114 --> 12:19.154
So, why poker?

12:20.617 --> 12:24.946
Why not crazy eights or chess? Why
don't l shut up like l said l would?

12:25.497 --> 12:29.494
l always get this way when
l'm nervous. What can l do to stop?

12:29.625 --> 12:33.539
l know what to do with hiccups,
but with runaway chattering...

12:37.424 --> 12:39.463
Hello, everyone.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.047
Hi, George.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.678
l understand you fellas have
a little poker game going tonight?

12:46.807 --> 12:49.013
We get together
every once in a while.

12:49.142 --> 12:51.467
Coach thought
you might like to sit in.

12:51.603 --> 12:57.356
l haven't played poker in years.
l just hope l don't embarrass myself.

12:57.483 --> 13:00.519
Embarrass yourself?
You're playing poker with guys

13:00.652 --> 13:03.522
who can't bet and chew gum
at the same time.

13:08.451 --> 13:11.985
We got an extra chair in here, Harry,
if you wanna sit in.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.828
Me?

13:13.955 --> 13:18.451
Well, l've heard that poker
can be a pleasant diversion,

13:19.961 --> 13:22.630
if it doesn't get too intense.

13:22.755 --> 13:26.834
- Aren't you playing, Coach?
- Not me, George. Gin's my game.

13:28.927 --> 13:33.054
OK. Minimum buy-in's $500.
Let's see some money, gentlemen.

13:39.603 --> 13:41.642
You're pretty good.

13:42.647 --> 13:47.143
- Lucky tonight.
- Yeah, real lucky, huh, Harry?

13:51.488 --> 13:53.480
Your bet, Cliff.

13:53.615 --> 13:59.403
l'll see that 50
and l'll raise you...

14:01.121 --> 14:07.455
Let's see. l'll raise you
1 00 Paul Revere commemoratives.

14:12.006 --> 14:13.998
You can't bet stamps.

14:15.842 --> 14:18.167
l'll fold, then.

14:18.303 --> 14:22.430
- Up to you, Norm.
- The Lord hates a coward.

14:22.557 --> 14:28.310
l'll see the 50 and raise $300.

14:29.479 --> 14:32.433
- You're bluffing.
- You're right. l'm out.

14:37.736 --> 14:39.610
l'll raise 500.

14:41.156 --> 14:42.983
Too rich for my blood.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.626
l'm calling you, George.

15:04.009 --> 15:06.465
Looks like it's my night, boys.

15:09.014 --> 15:13.011
Harry, maybe we ought to
get out of the game.

15:13.142 --> 15:14.969
- What for?
- No reason.

15:15.102 --> 15:17.260
You lost most of the money l put in,

15:17.396 --> 15:20.729
George has got all the cards,
and you're playing lousy.

15:20.857 --> 15:23.146
Everything's fine.
l'm toying with him.

15:23.276 --> 15:26.691
l'm giving him
a false sense of security.

15:26.821 --> 15:29.490
You're giving him
a genuine sense of security.

15:30.824 --> 15:32.864
Fellas, let's play cards.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.538
Straight to the jack.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.293
Damn.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.465
- What the hell happened?
- l lost.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.925
No kidding.
You lost everything l put in.

16:03.061 --> 16:05.551
Why didn't you cheat?
That was the whole point.

16:05.688 --> 16:10.812
l ran every gaff l know
and he beat me.

16:10.942 --> 16:14.856
l don't know what to say to you
except l'm sorry.

16:14.988 --> 16:17.146
l'm going to wash up.

16:17.281 --> 16:20.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's been a pleasure.

16:21.076 --> 16:25.619
Sam, could l ask you a question?
Does four of a kind beat a straight?

16:25.747 --> 16:26.861
Of course.

16:26.998 --> 16:30.580
Then why did Harry throw in
these four threes?

16:30.710 --> 16:34.707
- Look what time it's getting to be.
- George, hang on a second.

16:34.838 --> 16:37.411
- What's going on here?
- l'm just going home.

16:37.549 --> 16:39.588
Maybe not.

16:41.219 --> 16:44.836
You and Harry concocted this
whole deal this afternoon, right?

16:44.972 --> 16:47.463
Are you gonna go outside
and split the winnings?

16:47.599 --> 16:48.678
Of course not.

16:48.809 --> 16:52.177
Then you wouldn't mind
if we just take our money back.

16:56.065 --> 16:59.896
Try anything and l'll tell the police
about this poker game.

17:00.027 --> 17:03.111
You could lose your liquor licence.

17:03.238 --> 17:05.277
You've done this before.

17:08.034 --> 17:12.410
You made a fool out of me,
and you can keep my money.

17:12.538 --> 17:15.740
l just want my friends to get
their money back, every penny.

17:15.874 --> 17:17.582
You understand?

17:17.709 --> 17:20.828
l'm not giving you
any of my money back, Coach.

17:20.962 --> 17:27.675
- What if we cut up Harry's share?
- That's not such a bad idea.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.928
You could play him again, beat him,
and give us our money back.

17:32.055 --> 17:34.094
l never did like the guy.

17:36.016 --> 17:40.310
- l'll challenge him to another game.
- You think you can beat him?

17:40.437 --> 17:42.476
Of course l can.

17:43.898 --> 17:47.183
l can have three queens
in my hand at any time.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.399
All l need to know is
when he can't beat that.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.687
You mean like a sign?

17:52.823 --> 17:56.820
Please let me give the sign.
All this trouble's on account of me.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.702
Please let me give the sign.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.070
l don't know. lt's tricky, isn't it?

18:02.206 --> 18:06.499
He is the last person Harry would
figure being in on anything clever.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.993
Just don't screw it up.
Come here, Coach.

18:14.008 --> 18:18.835
Give your sign the first time
Harry can't beat three queens.

18:18.970 --> 18:21.757
- What's the sign?
- Let me see.

18:21.889 --> 18:24.843
l'll rub my nose like this.
lt's the old bunt sign.

18:24.975 --> 18:26.304
Got it.

18:28.145 --> 18:31.395
OK, good night, everybody.

18:31.523 --> 18:34.938
- George, you need a ride downtown?
- They're onto us, Harry.

18:35.068 --> 18:38.899
- Onto what?
- They figured out our little prank.

18:46.619 --> 18:52.491
Come on, Sam. Times are hard.
A guy's gotta do what he can.

18:52.624 --> 18:56.704
Harry, l was never
much of a team player,

18:56.836 --> 18:59.457
especially with Boston small-timers.

19:01.090 --> 19:06.629
Why don't you and me play a little
one-on-one for the whole jackpot.

19:09.055 --> 19:14.013
You know, Mole, l was never
too impressed by Arizona hustlers,

19:14.143 --> 19:17.393
except they got good sinuses.

19:20.565 --> 19:22.225
You're on.

19:22.359 --> 19:25.312
- Mind if l deal?
- No.

19:25.445 --> 19:29.228
- What's the game?
- Five-card draw, no limit.

19:29.365 --> 19:31.820
- Here's your half.
- Fine.

19:34.119 --> 19:36.526
- Ante's a yard.
- What?

19:36.663 --> 19:38.904
$1 00. Pay attention.

19:40.207 --> 19:42.579
l'll bet two.

19:43.961 --> 19:46.451
lt's covered. What do you need?

19:46.588 --> 19:48.047
One.

19:48.715 --> 19:50.754
Dealer takes one.

19:58.307 --> 20:00.975
George, did you see that?

20:03.353 --> 20:05.890
Yes, l did, Coach.

20:06.022 --> 20:08.975
l scratched my nose
because it was itchy.

20:10.984 --> 20:14.816
- Right. l saw you do that.
- lt was really itchy, George.

20:14.946 --> 20:17.946
- That's why you scratched it.
- Exactly.

20:18.074 --> 20:22.071
Stimulating conversation.
We playing cards or what?

20:22.202 --> 20:26.246
- lt's George's bet.
- Harry, let's stop fooling around.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.913
l'm going into my private stash.

20:34.463 --> 20:36.502
Ten grand.

20:40.176 --> 20:42.215
l like those socks.

20:49.643 --> 20:51.968
Covered.

20:52.103 --> 20:54.142
Three little ladies.

20:59.735 --> 21:02.142
- Four threes?
- That can't be.

21:02.279 --> 21:04.604
Seeing is believing, Mole.

21:04.739 --> 21:08.274
- Why did you make the bet?
- Because you scratched your nose.

21:08.409 --> 21:11.326
But l told you
why l scratched my nose.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.784
That does it. l never wanna see you
come through that door again.

21:16.916 --> 21:18.992
Don't worry, Malone, you won't.

21:20.378 --> 21:24.873
You caused me to lose a fortune,
you old fool.

21:25.007 --> 21:30.249
You're a stupid, blundering moron
who deserves to lose his money.

21:35.975 --> 21:38.216
What a night.

21:38.352 --> 21:40.925
l don't believe
the whole thing happened.

21:41.062 --> 21:43.102
l feel so used.

21:48.736 --> 21:50.775
What are you doing?

21:52.447 --> 21:54.487
Sammy, l think he's snapped.

21:58.619 --> 22:00.446
He's laughing.

22:00.579 --> 22:02.987
- What are you laughing at?
- That.

22:03.123 --> 22:05.792
One born every minute.

22:10.171 --> 22:12.709
We did it, Harry.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.209
There's your money.
Who wants to play double or nothing?

22:19.095 --> 22:22.298
You had George conned that
you two were working together

22:22.432 --> 22:24.471
while it was you and Coach?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.972
- You're not even close.
- Yeah, he is.

22:27.102 --> 22:29.640
That's it exactly.

22:30.856 --> 22:33.726
Come on, everybody, coffee's on me.

22:36.652 --> 22:39.143
So only you and Coach
knew about this?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.605
Why didn't you let us in on it?

22:41.740 --> 22:45.358
l didn't think you were
bright enough to pull it off.

22:45.493 --> 22:47.984
l still don't like you.

22:53.417 --> 22:56.750
You feeling lucky tonight?

22:57.963 --> 22:59.789
What you got in mind?

22:59.923 --> 23:03.006
A game of chance,
simple cut of the cards.

23:05.177 --> 23:07.715
What are the stakes?

23:08.513 --> 23:11.549
lf l win,
l get to go to bed with you.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.930
- What if l win?
- You get to go to bed with me.

23:23.234 --> 23:25.061
Forget it.

23:25.194 --> 23:28.444
l understand. You'd rather earn it.
