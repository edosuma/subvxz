00:00.795 --> 00:02.770
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.913 --> 00:05.293
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.369 --> 00:08.789
I have so many surprises
waiting for you.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.232
Can you tell me
who Roderick is?

00:10.346 --> 00:11.188
He's a friend of Joe's.

00:11.296 --> 00:12.693
What is Joe doing?
Why do you listen to him?

00:12.802 --> 00:14.735
He's teaching me
to feel my life.

00:14.844 --> 00:16.024
Damn it!

00:16.140 --> 00:17.528
Federal agents!
Get down now!

00:17.564 --> 00:18.504
Aah!

00:18.601 --> 00:19.989
I was just with your mom.

00:20.108 --> 00:21.049
I was supposed to
bring her here.

00:21.159 --> 00:22.822
- What happened?
- I screwed up.

00:22.950 --> 00:24.222
What happened
to Paul and Jacob?

00:24.337 --> 00:26.391
Why did you
leave us? Emma!

00:26.491 --> 00:29.193
The warden granted Joe
Carroll's request for a transfer.

00:29.295 --> 00:29.996
He's leaving.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.377
Joe's not in the
transport vehicle.

00:31.479 --> 00:32.615
One of his people
got to the warden.

00:32.728 --> 00:33.857
Where the hell is he?

00:33.980 --> 00:35.515
I'm David. It's
a pleasure, sir.

00:35.621 --> 00:36.671
Aah!

00:36.952 --> 00:38.150
Aah!

00:40.234 --> 00:42.384
So Joe's free,
and now get locked up.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.590
Protective custody.
Better if I don't know.

00:44.710 --> 00:45.617
Hey, Joey.

00:45.738 --> 00:48.510
I know you.
You're my dad.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.750
Hey, hey.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.068
Hey. Morning.

01:02.401 --> 01:04.075
You sleep all right?

01:06.004 --> 01:08.026
I know you're scared of me.

01:09.005 --> 01:12.589
I sensed it last night
when I first arrived,

01:13.964 --> 01:16.075
but I hope that will change

01:16.267 --> 01:19.035
and you'll give me
another chance.

01:22.821 --> 01:26.015
Nothing? Don't want
to speak to me?

01:27.929 --> 01:29.774
That's okay.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.016
Look. I'm sorry
your mother isn't here.

01:32.123 --> 01:33.072
She was meant to be.

01:33.183 --> 01:35.026
That was the plan,
but then things

01:35.141 --> 01:38.435
just went a little--
pff-- awry.

01:38.554 --> 01:41.552
I am doing everything
I can to-- to rectify that,

01:41.677 --> 01:44.398
but in the meantime,
I hope that you will...

01:45.265 --> 01:48.756
you will give me a chance
to prove that I am not a...

01:49.301 --> 01:50.926
a horrible man

01:51.067 --> 01:53.363
and that I have
the ability to be a rather--

01:53.979 --> 01:58.204
a rather cool
and fun guy-- uh, dad.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.985
Dad.

02:05.683 --> 02:09.759
Oh. Well, um, we'll
take things slow, huh?

02:11.426 --> 02:14.292
Well, that's all for now.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.881
How'd it go?

02:27.090 --> 02:30.692
He's giving me
the silent treatment.

02:31.335 --> 02:33.242
He needs to get to
know you, that's all.

02:36.471 --> 02:39.272
Come. Everyone's
waiting.

02:39.377 --> 02:40.753
What for?

02:41.273 --> 02:42.888
For you.

03:09.946 --> 03:11.676
Good morning, everybody.

03:13.091 --> 03:16.903
Sync and corrections by n17t01

03:20.846 --> 03:23.239
A suspect instrumental
in Carroll's escape

03:23.364 --> 03:25.551
was wounded and taken
into custody.

03:25.679 --> 03:27.147
Several deaths have...

03:30.514 --> 03:32.163
Carroll has escaped twice.

03:32.276 --> 03:34.333
This time, he flew away
in a helicopter.

03:34.452 --> 03:35.842
There's no way to spin that.

03:35.963 --> 03:38.525
This is
a Bureau nightmare, people.

03:38.628 --> 03:40.235
From now on,
we have a new protocol.

03:40.342 --> 03:42.746
All investigations
will need to be approved by me.

03:42.858 --> 03:45.597
Now I apologize in advance
for being a control freak,

03:46.478 --> 03:48.062
but that's the way
we're doing things.

03:50.233 --> 03:52.047
So I see Quantico
sent in a new guy.

03:52.168 --> 03:54.308
Nick Donovan,
top of the food chain.

03:54.420 --> 03:56.818
Director Franklin brought
him in to supervise us.

03:56.947 --> 03:58.216
So it's official.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.467
The Bureau's freaking out.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.140
Everyone's freaking out, Ryan.

04:01.256 --> 04:02.508
Carroll escaped twice.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.609
Have you turned on the TV?
The news is insane.

04:04.726 --> 04:06.442
What about Claire?
Are we sure she's safe?

04:06.545 --> 04:07.541
Has anyone spoken to her?

04:07.657 --> 04:08.794
Who's got her
detail-- Turner?

04:08.917 --> 04:09.877
I don't know anything.

04:10.003 --> 04:11.050
It's protective custody.

04:11.165 --> 04:12.432
I don't have
that kind of clearance.

04:12.562 --> 04:13.664
How about the guy
we have in custody,

04:13.776 --> 04:14.982
the acolyte from Joe's escape?

04:15.084 --> 04:16.499
I need to question him.

04:16.610 --> 04:18.207
You mean, the one you tortured?

04:19.378 --> 04:20.630
I got information.

04:20.749 --> 04:21.930
He did.

04:22.036 --> 04:23.038
We found the warden's daughter,

04:23.150 --> 04:25.290
and she is safe as a result.

04:27.541 --> 04:30.146
Ryan, nice to meet you.

04:31.076 --> 04:32.861
Have you run prints on the guy?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.579
Yeah. We got nothing.

04:34.683 --> 04:36.148
This cult is doing
a very good job

04:36.263 --> 04:37.685
of wiping their
identities clean.

04:37.799 --> 04:38.744
That's why we need
to speak to him,

04:38.884 --> 04:41.370
to find out who and where
this Roderick guy is.

04:41.632 --> 04:44.229
Ryan, we appreciate your help,

04:44.411 --> 04:45.838
but you were brought in
as a consultant,

04:45.961 --> 04:48.764
and I think it's time you adopt
more of a consulting presence.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.104
Uh, Carroll is the
one who made Ryan

04:50.227 --> 04:51.339
more than a consultant.

04:51.447 --> 04:52.729
I'm aware of that,

04:52.879 --> 04:55.306
but Ryan is no longer
an agent with the FBI.

04:55.441 --> 04:57.510
Oh, come on! You know
as well as I do that--

04:57.624 --> 05:00.151
No, it's okay.
He's right.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.955
I'm here to consult.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.284
This has become
a Bureau nightmare, right?

05:04.415 --> 05:05.658
I'm a liability.

05:05.784 --> 05:08.601
I'll just, uh-- I'll be
in the other room...

05:09.058 --> 05:10.499
consulting.

05:20.382 --> 05:21.570
Everything okay?

05:22.273 --> 05:23.379
Nobody likes me.

05:23.506 --> 05:26.007
Well, you're inconsistent
and extreme,

05:26.180 --> 05:27.686
and people don't know
how to respond to you.

05:27.963 --> 05:29.341
I was joking.

05:29.637 --> 05:30.857
Sorry.

05:30.974 --> 05:32.377
We need to bring our suspect
up for questioning.

05:32.483 --> 05:33.376
I want to talk to him.

05:33.495 --> 05:34.625
No can do.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.963
Donovan's gonna do it.

05:36.084 --> 05:37.531
He insisted.

05:37.690 --> 05:39.021
Great.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.610
I didn't realize
there were so many people.

05:44.537 --> 05:47.858
I've been cooped up
at the farmhouse.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.590
Well, I wanted Joey
to be comfortable.

05:51.747 --> 05:53.185
I know he trusts you.

05:53.299 --> 05:54.622
This would have
overwhelmed him.

05:54.759 --> 05:55.866
Mm-hmm.

05:59.416 --> 06:01.731
Any word from Jacob and Paul?

06:01.916 --> 06:05.045
No. They haven't
called,

06:05.183 --> 06:08.218
and there's been
nothing on the news.

06:08.334 --> 06:13.004
Well, I take that as a good sign
that they're somewhere safe.

06:16.049 --> 06:20.437
You know, I will never forget
what you've done for me.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.464
I have my son because of you.

06:26.515 --> 06:27.878
What the...?

06:33.858 --> 06:35.326
Joe Carroll.

06:41.153 --> 06:42.610
How the hell are you?

06:46.622 --> 06:48.085
Roderick!

06:48.900 --> 06:51.023
Ohh! I got here
as soon as I could.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.556
Ahh. It is good to see you.
Heh heh heh!

06:54.662 --> 06:55.851
Ha ha ha!

06:56.320 --> 06:57.630
I'm Roderick.

06:57.743 --> 06:58.789
You must be Emma.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.181
Nice to meet you in person.

07:00.724 --> 07:01.718
Darling.

07:01.852 --> 07:03.020
Easy on the charm.

07:04.848 --> 07:07.445
So far, everything
has worked out as planned.

07:08.197 --> 07:10.259
Yeah, sure, there's been a
few hiccups along the way.

07:10.375 --> 07:13.670
Ryan Hardy has kept us
on our toes.

07:13.771 --> 07:15.815
But you've improvised
quite nicely.

07:16.621 --> 07:18.639
I'm in your debt, my friend.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.097
Thank you.

07:20.402 --> 07:22.259
I'm the one that owes you.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.774
I killed two of those girls.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.862
You took the blame.

07:33.211 --> 07:36.649
There's no point both of
us rotting away in here.

07:37.894 --> 07:40.009
How can I ever repay you?

07:40.129 --> 07:42.014
Oh, you will.

07:42.506 --> 07:44.799
My friend, you will.

07:47.819 --> 07:51.210
We're in this together,
you and me.

07:51.319 --> 07:54.652
Everything I am
is because of you.

08:01.112 --> 08:03.529
Come on.
I'll show you around.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.716
Is this place insane or what?

08:08.119 --> 08:09.709
Interesting.

08:10.753 --> 08:12.811
It's a work in progress.

08:13.191 --> 08:14.696
We're slowly fixing it up.

08:14.813 --> 08:16.164
Takes a village, right?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.390
Sheriff Nelson.

08:18.636 --> 08:19.853
Yeah. Sheriff here.

08:19.955 --> 08:21.890
Did you want potato
salad or cole slaw

08:22.008 --> 08:23.420
with your sandwich?

08:23.526 --> 08:25.910
Let's go with potato salad
today, Sally honey.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.528
- Roger that, sir.
- Thank you.

08:31.797 --> 08:34.135
Sheriff's a very important
job around here.

08:39.094 --> 08:41.370
Seems our man in custody
has shut down.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.974
He won't talk
to anyone but you.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.595
Oh.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.458
What would you like
me to do, sir?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.569
I'd like you to sit in with me,

08:53.310 --> 08:54.987
and you can call me Nick.

08:55.093 --> 08:56.733
Sure thing, Nick.

08:57.009 --> 08:58.765
Anything I can do to help.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.128
I'm Nick Donovan, and you are?

09:21.489 --> 09:23.214
Hello, Ryan.

09:24.222 --> 09:27.430
Hello.
How's the leg?

09:27.548 --> 09:29.115
Sorry. I don't
know your name.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.697
You can call me David.

09:39.428 --> 09:41.683
This guy is nuts.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.783
Look at him.

09:49.494 --> 09:51.728
Is this a staring contest?

09:51.832 --> 09:54.328
Because you asked to see me.

09:54.545 --> 09:56.527
Here I am.

09:57.162 --> 09:59.322
How did you like
the plot twist?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.976
Joe Carroll escaping twice.

10:02.094 --> 10:03.350
Bet you didn't see that coming.

10:03.459 --> 10:04.522
Yeah. That was good.

10:04.650 --> 10:05.955
Now you're boring me.

10:06.078 --> 10:08.068
So you got something
to say, say it.

10:09.023 --> 10:12.888
Or you can tell us
where we find Joe.

10:12.993 --> 10:15.022
Oh, you're not gonna find Joe.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.829
You don't find us.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.061
We find you,

10:19.510 --> 10:21.410
and we're everywhere.

10:21.523 --> 10:23.496
We're your sons,
your daughters,

10:23.603 --> 10:25.482
husbands, your wives,

10:25.896 --> 10:28.414
neighbors, fathers, mothers,

10:28.539 --> 10:31.562
and soon, more
will be dead tomorrow.

10:31.671 --> 10:33.174
Now you're paraphrasing
Ted Bundy.

10:33.276 --> 10:34.828
He's paraphrasing Ted Bundy.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.149
Very poorly, I might add.

10:36.245 --> 10:37.549
What is the point of all this?

10:37.867 --> 10:40.581
Hold close your fear.

10:41.449 --> 10:42.736
It is all that you know

10:42.891 --> 10:45.358
when you take your last breath.

10:47.157 --> 10:49.259
Wow that was creepy.

10:52.510 --> 10:54.734
So how about you give
us something real...

10:56.397 --> 10:57.862
David?

11:12.240 --> 11:13.219
Hey, hey.

11:17.416 --> 11:18.601
Guards!

11:19.204 --> 11:22.465
Guards! Guards!

11:23.136 --> 11:24.276
He took something!

11:43.467 --> 11:45.022
We have tech town in here.

11:45.195 --> 11:49.222
Everything is completely
secure, untraceable.

11:49.634 --> 11:50.977
Charlie.

11:51.425 --> 11:52.595
You've been hiding
yourself away

11:52.732 --> 11:54.251
since I got here.

11:59.057 --> 12:00.486
I'm sorry, sir.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.548
About Claire.
I failed you.

12:04.715 --> 12:05.802
I want you to know
that--

12:05.905 --> 12:07.721
Not now, Charlie.

12:08.282 --> 12:10.408
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Charlie.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.178
Take what you've learned
and apply it, hmm?

12:17.663 --> 12:19.498
All right. This way.

12:20.613 --> 12:23.290
Hi. You remember Louise?

12:23.392 --> 12:25.062
Yes, but of course.
She was my savior.

12:25.158 --> 12:26.805
The pleasure was mine.

12:31.090 --> 12:32.924
We set this up for you.

12:33.782 --> 12:37.747
It's meant to be your--
your inspiration room,

12:38.529 --> 12:41.299
where you can write,
hold class,

12:41.660 --> 12:42.838
poker on mondays.

12:42.946 --> 12:45.221
How many people live here?

12:46.024 --> 12:47.772
I see so many new faces.

12:47.882 --> 12:49.261
I've been recruiting.

12:49.653 --> 12:50.441
There's the ones you know,

12:50.554 --> 12:52.364
about a dozen more
you have yet to meet.

12:52.481 --> 12:55.844
We've, uh, built a life here.

12:55.973 --> 12:58.684
In a small town that
you're sheriff of.

12:59.088 --> 13:00.881
That's genius.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.824
Everybody's...

13:03.957 --> 13:06.200
so excited you're
finally here, Joe.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.700
They're anxious to get started.

13:08.816 --> 13:10.456
As am I.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.046
Claire first.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.584
Do know where she is?

13:15.666 --> 13:17.173
She's in protective custody.

13:17.294 --> 13:19.352
They, uh, they got
her out clean.

13:19.693 --> 13:22.962
My son needs a mother.

13:23.252 --> 13:26.575
Losing Claire was a mistake.

13:27.346 --> 13:29.125
I'm sorry about that, Joe,

13:31.186 --> 13:33.299
but I have an idea
how we can find her.

13:36.031 --> 13:38.103
Let the FBI tell us.

13:38.804 --> 13:39.734
Heh heh.

13:39.845 --> 13:40.837
I've done all the research,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.482
I've got it all worked out.

13:45.581 --> 13:48.637
Which one first? Hmm?

13:52.495 --> 13:53.867
This one.

13:54.004 --> 13:55.278
We're waiting
on the coroner's report,

13:55.392 --> 13:56.923
but I think it's
a suicide pill,

13:57.309 --> 14:00.310
a basic cyanide or a
common PSP toxin.

14:00.438 --> 14:01.285
He had it in his hand.

14:01.396 --> 14:02.434
Yeah. It was sewn
into his skin.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.360
It was implanted in the fold

14:03.470 --> 14:04.965
between his thumb
and his forefinger.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.095
It's a CIA ploy
from the sixties.

14:07.223 --> 14:08.862
Al-Qaeda's been known
to use it, as well.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.514
I got some new intel
on the deceased.

14:11.639 --> 14:12.637
Thanks.

14:13.028 --> 14:14.309
I'll take that.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.903
Seriously?

14:20.288 --> 14:21.722
Based on the method
of his suicide,

14:21.838 --> 14:24.103
they ran his prints through
a military database.

14:24.401 --> 14:25.319
Came up with a match.

14:25.421 --> 14:26.530
Got a positive ID.

14:26.654 --> 14:27.900
Yeah, more than that.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.453
He's named in an investigation.

14:29.553 --> 14:31.331
There were soldiers
conducting lethal fights

14:31.438 --> 14:33.494
with Iraqi civilians for sport.

14:35.844 --> 14:38.171
My e-mail was hacked.
Was it you?

14:38.279 --> 14:39.673
Yeah. That was me.
I did it.

14:39.782 --> 14:42.093
Sorry, Ryan. You don't have
access to hack my e-mail.

14:42.177 --> 14:43.597
Weston?

14:44.215 --> 14:46.557
Uh, yes, sir, I did.

14:46.788 --> 14:47.712
I apologize.

14:47.810 --> 14:49.102
I need a word.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.353
What's going on?

15:00.849 --> 15:02.346
Think I got Weston in trouble.

15:02.466 --> 15:03.970
They hacked
Donovan's e-mail.

15:04.123 --> 15:06.205
You what?
Damn it, Ryan!

15:06.316 --> 15:07.539
What happened?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.080
I'm being sent home...

15:09.574 --> 15:10.898
Wait, wait.

15:11.016 --> 15:12.622
This is my fault.
I'll go.

15:12.744 --> 15:13.531
I asked him to do it.

15:13.645 --> 15:14.567
Well, he's going home.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.492
- And that's a bad call!
- Excuse me?

15:16.629 --> 15:18.862
Look, man. We're spinning
our wheels here.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.040
We need to keep things moving,

15:20.155 --> 15:22.162
and we can't do that if you're
sitting on information.

15:22.272 --> 15:24.526
This investigation
starts at my desk now.

15:24.635 --> 15:26.216
I understand your
relationship to this case,

15:26.325 --> 15:28.338
and I am trying
really hard to be polite,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.304
but it's not something
I excel at.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.565
Just go back to the motel,

15:39.788 --> 15:43.306
and we'll talk in the morning.

16:37.968 --> 16:39.421
Are you getting in?

16:39.535 --> 16:42.239
No, thanks. I'll wait
for the next one.

17:19.866 --> 17:20.852
You okay?

17:20.964 --> 17:21.957
Yeah.

17:22.189 --> 17:23.615
You need some help with that?

17:26.877 --> 17:28.820
No, I'm fine.
Thanks.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.596
Your call has been
forwarded to an automatic voi...

17:45.607 --> 17:47.809
Mitchell, Weston's
not picking up.

17:47.908 --> 17:49.230
I've tried him 3 times.

17:49.344 --> 17:50.711
That's not like him.
He always picks up.

17:50.807 --> 17:51.729
Can you ping his phone?

17:51.810 --> 17:53.242
Already on it.

17:54.749 --> 17:56.798
It says he's at the motel.

17:58.236 --> 17:59.805
Something's not right.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.172
I'm gonna check it out.
Let Parker know.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.411
You need to pace yourself.

18:29.558 --> 18:31.235
When was the last time
you were drunk?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.740
Oh. Years.

18:34.509 --> 18:37.393
Oh. Is that
scotch I see?

18:41.135 --> 18:43.922
Oh, this is really bad scotch.

18:44.274 --> 18:44.900
Heh heh heh.

18:44.997 --> 18:46.396
To hell with it.

18:48.126 --> 18:51.214
I don't think I'd know
good scotch anymore.

18:51.778 --> 18:53.360
Oh, damn it!

18:54.373 --> 18:59.240
What I really need is this
damn thing off, please.

18:59.535 --> 19:03.029
Of course.
You're sloshed.

19:03.167 --> 19:06.809
Oh, yes. Yes,
I am... sloshed.

19:06.925 --> 19:08.407
You deserve it.

19:08.816 --> 19:10.268
I'm sure there are
a lot of things

19:10.390 --> 19:12.233
that you need to catch up on.

19:13.727 --> 19:15.878
Yes. Yes. That's...

19:16.907 --> 19:18.442
that is true.

19:18.560 --> 19:23.534
It has been depressingly
quiet on that front.

19:23.807 --> 19:26.862
Um, you need to fix that then.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.687
Here you go.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.645
All better?

19:36.991 --> 19:39.494
Yes. All better.

19:41.316 --> 19:42.750
Roderick called.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.552
All's going to plan.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.425
They should be back by dawn.

19:45.536 --> 19:46.984
Splendid, Aaron.

19:47.084 --> 19:48.564
Thank you.

19:51.977 --> 19:56.121
So how long have you and
Roderick known each other?

19:56.397 --> 20:00.606
Oh. Uh, just a little bit
longer than I've known you.

20:01.590 --> 20:03.319
Was he a student of yours?

20:03.941 --> 20:06.752
Yes. In some ways,
he was, um...

20:07.574 --> 20:09.676
my first student.

20:10.107 --> 20:11.281
Why are we here?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.143
Why? Are you scared?

20:13.289 --> 20:17.750
No. Should I be,
Professor Carroll?

20:36.494 --> 20:38.116
Smell it?

20:39.910 --> 20:41.587
What am I doing here?

20:43.414 --> 20:45.623
I'd like to teach you.

20:54.935 --> 20:58.657
Now first I like to
gauge their fear.

21:00.736 --> 21:02.801
Listen to their breathing.

21:04.876 --> 21:07.145
You want to
get in sync with it...

21:09.334 --> 21:11.761
make their breathing
become yours.

21:11.867 --> 21:16.175
It's a way to connect
to their heartbeat.

21:22.224 --> 21:26.523
Now first take
the very tip of the blade,

21:26.671 --> 21:29.826
and you place it softly
on their skin.

21:29.919 --> 21:32.889
Then push every so gently

21:32.977 --> 21:36.020
until you feel the moment...

21:36.189 --> 21:37.134
of...

21:41.267 --> 21:42.557
give.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.025
Heh heh.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.387
Your scotch.

21:53.552 --> 21:54.092
Ohh.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.492
Your scotch is all-- heh.

21:59.358 --> 22:01.091
Joe...

22:07.949 --> 22:09.611
I love...

22:10.054 --> 22:12.965
I love my wife, Emma.

22:16.830 --> 22:19.044
You understand that?

22:20.773 --> 22:25.066
Now. Let's go
and find the others.

23:19.769 --> 23:22.141
Hey. Did Mitchell send over the
motel surveillance footage?

23:22.253 --> 23:23.813
Yeah. I got it
right here.

23:24.078 --> 23:26.071
They could have killed him,
they didn't.

23:26.188 --> 23:27.586
They want something.

23:27.780 --> 23:28.818
All right.
Confirmed identities

23:28.943 --> 23:30.127
of who were dealing with.

23:30.239 --> 23:33.060
Charles Mead, the man who
abducted Claire Matthews, is one.

23:33.222 --> 23:35.563
The other is Louise Sinclair
out of New Orleans,

23:35.667 --> 23:37.120
former Blackwater operative.

23:37.255 --> 23:38.700
Another overachiever.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.289
Find out if she ran
the plates yet.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.099
We put out an APB in a
300-mile radius of Richmond.

23:43.202 --> 23:44.341
If it's out there,
we'll find it.

23:44.425 --> 23:45.547
Put the call on speaker.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.332
Debra, it's Nick.

23:49.433 --> 23:51.344
The image of the license
plate isn't perfect.

23:51.469 --> 23:54.564
We can make out 3,
maybe 4 numbers clearly,

23:55.012 --> 23:57.160
but the local police found
9 potential matches

23:57.265 --> 23:58.740
of the color, make, and model.

23:58.832 --> 24:01.158
They've got 9 potential
matches on the plates.

24:01.272 --> 24:02.282
Where are the cars?

24:02.377 --> 24:04.431
A couple of them are
registered to upstate New York.

24:04.561 --> 24:06.529
Two registered
in upstate New York.

24:06.633 --> 24:07.672
Two are out of service,

24:07.782 --> 24:09.029
police spotted one
in a parking lot

24:09.151 --> 24:11.052
outside an abandoned shipyard
in Newport Harbor.

24:11.171 --> 24:12.720
Police spotted one
in a parking lot

24:12.818 --> 24:15.452
outside an abandoned shipyard
in Newport Harbor.

24:15.566 --> 24:16.482
That's the one.

24:16.583 --> 24:17.314
How do you know?

24:17.407 --> 24:19.670
Timestamp on the video is
about an hour and a half ago.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.750
That's how long it takes to get
from here to Newport Harbor,

24:21.846 --> 24:23.242
plus they need
someplace quiet to do

24:23.358 --> 24:24.646
whatever it is they're
gonna do to him.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.174
Abandoned shipyard
fits the bill.

24:26.282 --> 24:27.180
Sounds like a hunch.

24:27.279 --> 24:28.872
A good one.
We're gonna head over.

24:28.974 --> 24:29.882
That's my call.

24:30.007 --> 24:31.486
So make it.

24:34.294 --> 24:36.598
Fine. Go.

24:36.924 --> 24:38.114
Let's go.

24:50.278 --> 24:51.754
Agent Weston.

24:53.350 --> 24:54.975
Welcome to our little...

24:55.347 --> 24:57.277
slice of paradise.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.579
Thanks.

24:58.719 --> 24:59.873
You are?

25:00.235 --> 25:03.331
I'm your host
for tonight's main event.

25:04.118 --> 25:05.587
Here's how it works.

25:05.956 --> 25:08.009
I'm going to ask you
a few questions,

25:08.137 --> 25:11.668
you're going to
answer them, truthfully.

25:12.693 --> 25:14.289
And if I don't?

25:14.883 --> 25:16.745
That's where it gets fun.

25:17.186 --> 25:19.112
See, we have a little game
that we like to play,

25:19.233 --> 25:20.951
a fight sport.

25:21.502 --> 25:24.986
You lie, we begin a round.

25:25.663 --> 25:27.586
You lie some more...

25:29.670 --> 25:31.596
it gets worse. Heh.

25:34.976 --> 25:38.057
So... tell me...

25:42.089 --> 25:44.359
where is Claire Matthews?

25:45.405 --> 25:47.373
Ha ha ha!

25:47.829 --> 25:49.600
Is that what this is about?

25:49.917 --> 25:51.272
Sorry, man.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.429
She's in protective custody.

25:52.530 --> 25:54.178
No one knows where she is.

25:54.544 --> 25:57.922
Bzzzt. That's a lie.

25:58.741 --> 26:00.581
Round one.

26:02.433 --> 26:04.015
Ding ding.

26:11.809 --> 26:13.766
Come on now.
You need to get up.

26:13.991 --> 26:16.117
Big boy.
Gonna have some fun.

26:20.508 --> 26:21.669
Nice!

26:23.339 --> 26:25.545
Match on our hands here.

26:25.672 --> 26:27.375
Rah rah.
Pick it up, boys.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.237
Let's see some real blood.

26:38.508 --> 26:39.731
Unh!

26:53.778 --> 26:55.303
Okay. All right,
all right.

26:55.403 --> 26:56.668
Hey.

27:00.485 --> 27:02.405
You want to end this?

27:02.908 --> 27:04.539
Tell us where Claire is.

27:07.423 --> 27:09.171
I don't know anything.

27:09.627 --> 27:11.992
You think we don't
know about you?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.438
Agent Michael Emerson Weston,

27:15.567 --> 27:17.705
born in San Diego, California,

27:17.807 --> 27:20.305
political science major
at Wesleyan,

27:20.420 --> 27:21.964
then 3 years at Quantico

27:22.076 --> 27:25.418
studying high-profile
personal security.

27:25.522 --> 27:27.219
You know everyone,
you know everything

27:27.324 --> 27:29.956
about FBI protective custody.

27:31.874 --> 27:34.013
You know where they hid Claire.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.817
You know everything about me,

27:37.356 --> 27:39.128
and I don't know
anything about you.

27:39.696 --> 27:41.071
Roderick?

27:44.934 --> 27:47.104
Isn't that what they call you?

27:53.746 --> 27:55.051
Yeah.

27:55.161 --> 27:58.392
Okay. Same question,
second round.

27:58.495 --> 27:59.678
Where's Claire?

28:00.310 --> 28:01.806
I don't know.

28:01.909 --> 28:03.303
They didn't tell me that.
Why would they?

28:03.411 --> 28:05.163
Round two's gonna hurt.

28:16.483 --> 28:17.976
Ding ding.

28:22.787 --> 28:24.052
Unh!

28:49.795 --> 28:51.473
That's definitely the car.

28:51.780 --> 28:53.243
They got to be inside.

28:53.344 --> 28:55.009
I'll check the perimeter.

29:03.220 --> 29:05.228
Come on. Come on.

29:05.339 --> 29:06.481
Ring-a-ding-ding.

29:06.771 --> 29:08.116
Come on.

29:08.815 --> 29:12.386
It's not over until
you stop breathing.

29:20.266 --> 29:21.903
You're still breathing.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.404
You got one last chance here.

29:29.196 --> 29:30.674
Where's Claire?

29:33.107 --> 29:34.749
I don't know.

29:35.182 --> 29:36.870
I don't know.

29:38.613 --> 29:40.890
I don't--
I don't know.

29:44.338 --> 29:46.551
I don't know, I don't know.

29:46.647 --> 29:48.381
I believe you.

29:49.124 --> 29:51.832
I believe you.

29:55.652 --> 29:57.306
Final round.

30:25.398 --> 30:27.099
Help him up.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.061
Get up!

30:33.452 --> 30:36.078
I'm gonna find Claire
whether you help me or not.

31:04.786 --> 31:06.726
Aah!

31:19.553 --> 31:21.277
I got this.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.255
Help me hold his head.

31:39.890 --> 31:41.222
Let's get out of here.

31:56.775 --> 31:59.149
Stop! FBI!

31:59.651 --> 32:01.261
FBI!

32:11.506 --> 32:13.863
Oh. No, no. Don't
move, don't move.

32:14.072 --> 32:15.619
An ambulance is coming.

32:15.996 --> 32:17.369
Take it easy.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.305
I didn't tell them, Ryan.

32:22.018 --> 32:24.524
I didn't tell them anything.

32:25.943 --> 32:27.629
Okay.

32:31.435 --> 32:32.556
Hey, hey, hey.

32:32.665 --> 32:34.597
Come on.
Come on, come on.

32:34.710 --> 32:36.368
Stay with me, buddy.

32:53.269 --> 32:56.368
Severe concussion, blood loss.

32:56.487 --> 32:59.621
He'll need surgery, but the paramedics
believe he'll pull through.

33:08.271 --> 33:10.058
You okay?

33:12.489 --> 33:14.021
No.

33:15.378 --> 33:18.685
I'm gonna head over
to the hospital.

33:19.103 --> 33:21.273
He'll be in surgery for hours.

33:22.185 --> 33:23.771
Still.

33:26.268 --> 33:28.796
You know this wasn't
your fault, Ryan?

33:30.956 --> 33:34.819
You can't own everything
that goes wrong.

33:35.396 --> 33:37.613
No. That's not it.

33:38.104 --> 33:40.220
It's just I know hospitals.

33:40.327 --> 33:41.970
They're no fun.
Just think somebody

33:42.078 --> 33:44.546
should be there when he
wakes up, that's all.

34:16.027 --> 34:17.909
We got nothing,

34:18.253 --> 34:20.396
lost 5 men.

34:24.245 --> 34:26.344
I'm sorry, Joe.

34:29.491 --> 34:31.478
You'll find Claire.

34:35.587 --> 34:36.637
And bring her home.

34:36.755 --> 34:39.719
Of that I'm... certain.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.293
I will find her...

34:44.168 --> 34:46.045
I owe you that.

34:51.947 --> 34:53.301
One more thing.

35:07.890 --> 35:09.641
I let you down again, sir.

35:09.745 --> 35:11.434
I won't lie, Charlie.

35:12.395 --> 35:14.443
I'm disappointed.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.018
I want to make it right.

35:19.018 --> 35:21.402
The reason I wanted
to know you,

35:22.127 --> 35:24.125
to be a part of this

35:25.295 --> 35:29.341
is I wanted my life
to mean something.

35:30.074 --> 35:31.268
Hmm.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.078
You want to do this for me?

36:31.205 --> 36:34.430
I want to be important, sir.

36:35.576 --> 36:37.932
I want my life to matter.

36:40.141 --> 36:42.312
This is my gift.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.687
And my apology.

37:06.417 --> 37:09.185
You will always matter.

39:03.034 --> 39:04.363
How long has he been out?

39:04.481 --> 39:05.459
About an hour.

39:05.585 --> 39:07.087
Surgery went well.

39:07.187 --> 39:09.742
Kept saying, "I didn't
tell them anything."

39:09.825 --> 39:11.616
What was he talking about?

39:12.030 --> 39:13.839
Claire's location.

39:17.537 --> 39:19.224
He knew the whole time?

39:19.944 --> 39:21.268
Yeah.

39:21.382 --> 39:23.625
He spent two years with the
Protective Custody Division

39:23.734 --> 39:25.457
in Quantico.

39:25.572 --> 39:27.324
He has clearance.

39:28.865 --> 39:31.853
He's the only one who does
know where Claire is.
