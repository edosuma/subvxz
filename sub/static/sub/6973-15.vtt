Almost home now, Jason.
What do we say?

00:15.915 --> 00:19.078
[Together]
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

00:19.152 --> 00:21.416
but words can never hurt me.

00:21.488 --> 00:24.753
Keep your chin up, son.
We'll get through this just fne.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.354
[Yelling, Shouting]

00:32.432 --> 00:34.832
Jason, have you got a comment?
How do you feel, Jason?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.137
[Man]
Back up! Back up, there!

00:55.455 --> 00:57.480
Okay, folks, come on out.
You're safe now.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.856
Just step out and stay in front of me.
We'll get you in your house.

01:00.927 --> 01:03.361
- Come on, son.
- Just stay in front of me.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.034
[Thunder Rumbling]

01:23.483 --> 01:26.077
There you go, sweetheart.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.882
If you need anything
during the night,

01:28.955 --> 01:32.391
if you don't feel well,
you just ring that bell, okay?

01:32.459 --> 01:35.121
Okay, Mom.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.493
Good night, Jason.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.172
I know you're afraid.

01:56.015 --> 01:59.041
Maybe you think those people
outside are right...

01:59.119 --> 02:02.350
that we should take you to the hospital
and let the doctors treat you.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.690
We could do that.

02:05.758 --> 02:11.196
And they might take away your cancer
and your body might feel better,

02:11.264 --> 02:13.858
but not your soul.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.767
It's God himself who gave you
this illness, Jason,

02:17.837 --> 02:20.670
for reasons that are his.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.767
If you're to be well
in body and spirit,

02:24.844 --> 02:27.972
it's God who must come
to deliver you.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.826
[Wind Howling]

02:55.608 --> 02:57.838
[Rumbling]

05:00.698 --> 05:03.758
Good morning. Here's a story to warm
the cockles of your heart, Scully.

05:03.834 --> 05:07.770
"An 11 -year-old boy diagnosed with
lymphatic cancer cured with a miracle."

05:07.838 --> 05:09.897
Jason McPeck.
Goochland, Virginia.

05:09.974 --> 05:11.874
Oh.

05:11.942 --> 05:15.878
Yeah, his parents refused
treatment on religious grounds.

05:15.946 --> 05:18.176
His faith forbids
medical aid,

05:18.249 --> 05:20.444
and soJason's cure
was delivered by angels.

05:22.353 --> 05:25.811
Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder,
isn't completely unheard of.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.188
So-called "miracle" recoveries
attributable...

05:28.259 --> 05:30.193
to no clear cause or reason.

05:30.261 --> 05:33.458
It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of.
It's the messenger.

05:33.531 --> 05:35.465
That came as
an anonymous e-mail to me...

05:35.533 --> 05:38.468
from the Defense Advance
Research Projects Agency.

05:38.536 --> 05:41.096
- DARPA?
- Someone at DARPA.

05:41.172 --> 05:43.868
How'd you hear about it?

05:43.941 --> 05:45.875
[Clears Throat]

05:47.645 --> 05:49.738
You subscribe to
the Goochland Guardian?

05:49.814 --> 05:51.281
No.

05:51.348 --> 05:53.407
So this just appeared miraculously
on your doorstep this morning?

05:53.484 --> 05:56.112
As far as I can tell, I was
the only one to whom it was delivered.

05:56.187 --> 05:58.655
Someone wants us
on this case.

05:58.722 --> 06:01.589
- It's not a case, Mulder.
- Yeah, not yet.

06:01.659 --> 06:03.524
I'm gonna go
back over to DARPA.

06:03.594 --> 06:05.619
You see what else you can
find out about that boy.

06:07.331 --> 06:10.164
I just gotta know whether it was
Roma Downey or Della Reese.

06:13.571 --> 06:16.506
[Laughing, Shouting]

06:28.686 --> 06:30.620
- Yes?
- Hi.

06:30.688 --> 06:34.317
I'm Dana Scully with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

06:34.391 --> 06:38.293
- Are you Mrs. McPeck?
- What can we do for you?

06:38.362 --> 06:40.694
I'm here about your son.

06:40.764 --> 06:42.959
- Are we under investigation?
- Uh, no.

06:43.033 --> 06:47.333
L-I was just hoping to better
understand what happened to him.

06:47.404 --> 06:50.430
- May I ask, is he okay?
- Jason, you've got somebody to see you.

06:52.376 --> 06:55.345
- Tell her how you're feeling.
- I feel good.

06:55.412 --> 06:57.437
Just a little out of breath.

06:57.515 --> 06:59.449
You're looking at God's work.

06:59.517 --> 07:02.782
Jason's life owes to his grace
and exalts his name in the highest.

07:02.853 --> 07:05.014
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

07:06.423 --> 07:08.789
And you say that
you saw angels?

07:09.927 --> 07:13.158
- Yes.
- May I ask what they looked like?

07:13.230 --> 07:15.698
They looked like men.

07:15.766 --> 07:18.166
They came from the sky
in a ball of light.

07:19.537 --> 07:22.472
- And what did they say?
- They said not to be afraid.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.373
Then one of them
pinched me kind of hard.

07:25.442 --> 07:28.570
- And then I was better right away.
- He pinched you? Where?

07:28.646 --> 07:30.511
Right here.

08:00.511 --> 08:03.537
- What the hell are you doing?
- God's work. What else?

08:03.614 --> 08:07.812
- Get out of my car.
- I'd hoped for more
accommodation toward the man...

08:07.885 --> 08:10.683
who saved that young boy's life,
and yours.

08:11.755 --> 08:14.280
You got your light.
Now get out.

08:21.699 --> 08:23.633
You're not at all curious...

08:23.701 --> 08:27.193
about the chip that's been
put in that boy's neck?

08:27.271 --> 08:30.934
You, a medical doctor, who has
the same technology in your body,

08:31.008 --> 08:33.602
who's witnessed this
wondrous miracle firsthand?

08:33.677 --> 08:38.477
I've taken considerable trouble
to prove my intentions.

08:38.549 --> 08:42.212
The newspaper at your door,
the e-mail to Mulder,

08:42.285 --> 08:45.983
the elaborate demonstration
of curing this boy's cancer.

08:46.056 --> 08:48.456
You see,
I'm dying myself.

08:50.861 --> 08:54.592
A dying man who wants to make right...
to share his secrets...

08:54.665 --> 08:57.065
and to bequeath this cure to millions
of others, just like that boy.

08:57.134 --> 08:59.728
So you wanna give it to us?

08:59.803 --> 09:01.634
To you, Agent Scully.

09:01.705 --> 09:05.505
I've tired of
Mulder's muleheadedness.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.942
His foolish ideas
of overthrowing the system.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.503
You think
I'm fooled by this?

09:10.581 --> 09:12.606
I made you my offer.

09:12.683 --> 09:16.084
Agent Mulder hears a breath of this,
rest assure I'll rescind it.

09:17.721 --> 09:20.087
Take it to my grave.

09:53.357 --> 09:55.325
[Line Ringing]

10:13.444 --> 10:17.676
- [Woman, Indistinct]
- Yes, I need a trace
on a D.C. Area phone number.

10:17.748 --> 10:21.240
I need an address.
Thank you.

10:34.998 --> 10:38.559
- May I help you?
- I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

10:40.471 --> 10:43.201
- [Lock Clicks]
- May I see some identification?

10:45.476 --> 10:48.070
Look, is this necessary?
I just walked through the wrong door.

10:48.145 --> 10:49.908
Your identification, please.

11:06.597 --> 11:08.565
- Look...
- Third floor.

11:44.902 --> 11:46.836
[Cigarette-Smoking Man]
Agent Scully.

12:00.481 --> 12:02.346
Please, sit.

12:06.421 --> 12:10.289
- I'm glad you came.
- You obviously knew that I would.

12:10.358 --> 12:15.455
- Well, I know you're a doctor
and a woman of compassion.
- Please.

12:22.136 --> 12:24.070
In the end...

12:25.506 --> 12:28.134
a man finally looks
at the sum of his life...

12:28.209 --> 12:30.143
to see what
he'll leave behind.

12:30.211 --> 12:33.180
Most of what I worked to build
is in ruins.

12:33.247 --> 12:36.216
And now that
the darkness descends,

12:36.284 --> 12:38.775
I find I have
no real legacy.

12:40.688 --> 12:42.622
What are you dying of?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.694
Cerebral inflammation.

12:47.762 --> 12:49.855
A consequence of brain surgery
I had in the fall.

12:49.931 --> 12:51.865
The doctors give me
just a few months.

12:51.933 --> 12:55.300
So you want to use me
to clear the slate...

12:56.537 --> 12:59.370
to make you
a respectable person?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.374
It won't work.

13:03.044 --> 13:05.535
How many people in the world
are dying of cancer?

13:06.981 --> 13:10.280
And here we are
wasting time with the past.

13:10.351 --> 13:12.717
I'm here.
Where is it?

13:12.787 --> 13:16.154
This miracle cure of yours.

13:16.224 --> 13:19.819
We'll need to take a trip.
It will require a few days.

13:19.894 --> 13:22.658
I'll get back to you.

13:22.730 --> 13:24.925
I have access, Agent Scully.

13:26.901 --> 13:30.029
I have these miraculous chips, but the
genetic research that makes them work...

13:30.104 --> 13:32.766
is closely guarded.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.865
There are men in this building
who would kill me if they knew...

13:34.942 --> 13:37.342
what I'd offered you.

13:37.411 --> 13:39.606
They'd kill you too
in the blink of an eye.

13:41.782 --> 13:44.751
I've destroyed a lot
of things in my life,

13:46.020 --> 13:48.454
including the people
most precious to me.

13:48.523 --> 13:53.859
All I want is a chance to do something
in service to man before I go.

14:08.476 --> 14:12.003
[Electronic Voice]
Call received 8:01 p.m.

14:12.079 --> 14:14.343
[Scully] Mulder, it's me.
I wanted to let you know...

14:14.415 --> 14:16.542
that I'll be out of town
for a day or two.

14:16.617 --> 14:19.177
It's a family emergency.

14:19.253 --> 14:21.187
I'll call you when I can.

14:21.255 --> 14:24.816
[Dialing Phone]

14:28.529 --> 14:32.021
- [Phone Ringing]
- This is Dana Scully.
I'm not in right now.

14:32.099 --> 14:34.727
- Please leave a message after the beep.
- [Beeps]

14:34.802 --> 14:37.669
[Mulder] Hey, Scully, it's me.
Pick up if you're there.

14:37.738 --> 14:40.764
Scully, you there?

14:40.841 --> 14:43.776
All right, I just... I got your message,
and I hope everything's okay.

14:43.844 --> 14:45.778
I'll try you
on your cell right now.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.676
You're going to smoke?

15:56.751 --> 15:59.345
[Window Lowering]

16:04.425 --> 16:08.521
- It's time I quit.
- Just like that?

16:08.596 --> 16:11.497
No sacrifice
is purely altruistic.

16:11.565 --> 16:14.159
We give,
expecting to receive.

16:14.235 --> 16:16.669
What exactly is it
you expect to receive?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.608
Your trust.

16:23.177 --> 16:26.772
You question my sincerity.
You think I'm heartless.

16:26.847 --> 16:29.281
Would it soften your opinion
of me if I confessed that...

16:29.350 --> 16:31.682
I've always had
a particular affection for you?

16:35.156 --> 16:37.215
I assure you,
my intentions are honorable.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.282
I have affection
for Mulder too.

16:40.428 --> 16:42.362
My affection for you
is special.

16:43.464 --> 16:46.524
I held your life in my hands.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.626
Your cancer was terminal,
and I had a cure.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.638
Can you imagine
what that's like?

16:51.706 --> 16:54.266
To have the power
to extinguish a life...

16:54.342 --> 16:56.333
or to save it
and let it flourish?

16:59.647 --> 17:02.047
Now to give you that power...

17:03.117 --> 17:05.050
so you can do the same.

17:08.888 --> 17:11.686
She said
it was a family matter.

17:11.759 --> 17:15.752
Dropped off the key, asked me
to water the plants. No biggie.

17:15.829 --> 17:18.526
A great girl.
Independent as they come, you know?

17:18.598 --> 17:20.567
- She's a great girl.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:20.634 --> 17:23.159
Tenants like having
an F.B.I. Agent in the building.

17:23.237 --> 17:25.171
Gives them
a sense of security.

17:25.239 --> 17:27.469
Do you know how many people
have died in there?

17:27.540 --> 17:31.204
- We don't talk about that.
- You said she was carrying a suitcase.

17:31.278 --> 17:33.644
Did you notice anything else?
Anything abnormal?

17:33.714 --> 17:37.115
No, no. Actually,
it wasn't her carrying the suitcase.

17:37.184 --> 17:39.948
- It was her driver.
- Her driver?

17:40.020 --> 17:41.954
Yeah, an older guy.
Tall.

17:42.022 --> 17:44.786
I've seen him here before.
Smokes like a chimney.

17:47.361 --> 17:49.295
Hey, don't you want...

18:03.744 --> 18:07.646
You've been at the wheel too long.
Would you like me to drive?

18:07.715 --> 18:10.479
I might if you let me know
where we're going.

18:12.319 --> 18:15.311
Knowing that, you'd feel comfortable?
You'd trust me?

18:18.125 --> 18:20.059
How long did it take Mulder
to win your trust?

18:20.127 --> 18:22.186
I've always trusted Mulder.

18:23.631 --> 18:27.328
You're not being honest with yourself.
Think back.

18:27.401 --> 18:29.528
There was a time when you feared
for your future, for your career,

18:29.603 --> 18:32.504
when you were frst partnered
with this man.

18:32.573 --> 18:34.734
I told you,
I've studied you for years.

18:36.377 --> 18:39.141
And if you would permit me,
I'd like to make an observation.

18:40.648 --> 18:43.412
You're drawn to powerful men,

18:43.484 --> 18:46.385
but you fear their power.

18:46.454 --> 18:49.890
You keep your guard up...
a wall around your heart.

18:49.957 --> 18:52.152
How else do you explain
that fearless devotion...

18:52.226 --> 18:54.717
to a man obsessed
and a life alone?

18:55.796 --> 18:58.094
You'd die for Mulder,

18:58.165 --> 19:00.099
but you won't allow yourself
to love him.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.804
Wow.

19:04.872 --> 19:07.102
I'm learning
a whole other side to you.

19:07.174 --> 19:12.009
You're not just a coldblooded killer.
You're a pop psychologist as well.

19:13.981 --> 19:15.915
I've been a destroyer
all my life.

19:17.885 --> 19:19.978
Before I die,

19:20.054 --> 19:23.023
I'd like to prove that
I'm capable of something more.

19:25.659 --> 19:28.287
- Turn here, on the left.
- Where are we going?

19:28.362 --> 19:30.296
To show you
what I'm capable of.

20:09.668 --> 20:13.263
[Cigarette-Smoking Man]
Her name's Marjorie Butters.
She's got quite a green thumb.

20:13.338 --> 20:16.432
Plays a mean game of Scrabble,
if you're interested.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.942
And what's
her relationship to you?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.944
Well, how should I put it?

20:21.012 --> 20:24.072
You could say that
I'm her angel.

- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

20:54.079 --> 20:57.139
Well, come inside.
I baked some fresh bread this morning.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.309
And there are tomatoes
from the garden.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.478
I'll put the kettle on.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.958
To have this power...

21:11.029 --> 21:13.497
to visit this woman
and see her joy...

21:16.802 --> 21:18.736
It must be why
you became a doctor.

21:29.781 --> 21:31.715
I'll expect your call.
Thanks.

21:31.783 --> 21:34.843
She requisitioned a fleet sedan
when she left the Bureau yesterday.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.388
I don't know why,
and there have been no fuel charges.

21:37.455 --> 21:39.889
Her mother doesn't know anything
about a family emergency.

21:39.958 --> 21:42.893
Look, I know you're worried
about the company that she's in.

21:42.961 --> 21:45.657
But from what you've told me,
it's not like she's sneaking out.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.426
And the truth is, she's gone to
a lot of trouble to allay your fears.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.764
I know she can
take care of herself.

21:50.836 --> 21:52.770
It's just not like her
to lie to me.

21:52.838 --> 21:55.329
[Phone Ringing]

21:55.407 --> 21:57.341
That's my private line.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.044
- Skinner.
- [Scully] Sir?

22:01.112 --> 22:03.876
- Agent Scully, where are you?
- I'm on the road.

22:03.949 --> 22:07.077
- I'm sorry to call you on this line.
- It's all right.

22:07.152 --> 22:08.710
It's just we've been
worried about you.

22:08.787 --> 22:12.621
Everything's okay. I just wanted you
to express that to Mulder.

22:12.691 --> 22:16.923
- He's standing right here.
Why don't you do that yourself.
- No, sir, that's all right.

22:16.995 --> 22:20.931
Can you tell him that I'll call him
later? Just tell him that I'm fine.

22:23.435 --> 22:25.369
She said she's fine.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.438
She's in trouble.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.059
I'm going
to the restroom.

23:13.919 --> 23:17.150
Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able
to make sense of what's on this tape.

23:17.222 --> 23:19.349
I had no other way
of contacting you.

23:19.424 --> 23:21.619
Please try and understand
that I weighed the risks.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.752
I couldn't divulge these plans
without risking them,

23:23.828 --> 23:26.296
and I promise you
that I weighed everything.

23:26.364 --> 23:29.663
Our current location is northbound
on the Upstate Expressway.

23:29.734 --> 23:32.999
We're driving
my F.B.I. Fleet sedan.

23:33.071 --> 23:35.869
I promise I will get these tapes
to you as fast as I can.

23:53.758 --> 23:56.318
Oh!
Excuse me.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.864
Lifesaver?

24:36.434 --> 24:39.835
You may as well get comfortable.
We've got a good drive ahead.

26:07.058 --> 26:09.151
[Knocking On Door]

26:18.203 --> 26:20.137
It's the masters of disguise.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.800
- Can we laugh it up in your apartment?
- We got heat on our tail.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.241
We did what you asked,
pulled up what we could on Scully.

26:26.311 --> 26:29.803
We started with her credit cards to see
if she purchased any airline tickets.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.714
And ended up hacking into
some defense department node.

26:32.784 --> 26:35.184
Where they demanded that
we immediately identify ourselves...

26:35.253 --> 26:38.381
or face prosecution for espionage
or crimes against the government.

26:38.456 --> 26:40.447
What does this have to do
with finding Scully?

26:40.525 --> 26:44.188
When we went into her computer, we found
a series of deleted transmissions.

26:44.262 --> 26:47.493
E-mail that had been erased from her
sub-directories, but not her hard drive.

26:47.565 --> 26:51.399
- A series of communications.
- From someone named Cobra.

26:51.469 --> 26:54.905
Who the hell is Cobra?
Scully would have told me about him.

26:54.973 --> 26:58.534
Well, looks like she's gone to
great lengths to keep this from you.

26:58.610 --> 27:03.138
I don't believe that. She knows
that I'd fnd her no matter what.

27:03.214 --> 27:06.081
Mulder, we can't find her.
There's nowhere to start looking.

27:06.151 --> 27:08.551
Yeah, I don't
believe that either.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.554
Give me that.

27:56.665 --> 27:58.826
How do you take your coffee?

27:58.900 --> 28:00.834
Unadulterated, thank you.

28:03.705 --> 28:05.639
You drugged me.

28:05.707 --> 28:07.698
I did nothing of the sort.

28:07.776 --> 28:10.108
How the hell did I get
out of my clothes and into bed?

28:10.178 --> 28:13.045
I carried you.
You'd been up for over 30 hours.

28:13.115 --> 28:16.448
You were delirious.
I only wanted to make you comfortable.

28:20.222 --> 28:23.055
- Where are we?
- Milford, Pennsylvania.

28:23.125 --> 28:25.457
Well, that wasn't
part of the deal.

28:25.527 --> 28:28.087
I don't know
what you're up to.

28:34.069 --> 28:36.594
The keys are in the ignition.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.605
You're free to go, of course.

28:40.342 --> 28:42.469
The choice is still yours.

29:00.929 --> 29:02.760
Sir, I need your attention.

29:02.831 --> 29:04.765
- Is my assistant...
- No.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.767
She's away from her desk.
I wouldn't just bust in here,

29:06.835 --> 29:09.531
- but as I said,
it's a breaking situation.
- What the hell's going on?

29:09.604 --> 29:13.665
- That's my question exactly.
I believe you've all met.
- Is this place secure?

29:13.742 --> 29:16.142
- Is it secure?
- Don't get testy, G-man.

29:16.211 --> 29:19.612
Are you aware of a federal fugitive
code-named Cobra?

29:21.883 --> 29:23.942
For the past six months,
Cobra's been e-mailing Scully...

29:24.019 --> 29:26.146
from the Department of Defense
where he works on a shadow project...

29:26.221 --> 29:28.052
for advanced research.

29:28.123 --> 29:31.354
- A shadow project is right.
- Where this dude works,
even the shadows have shadows.

29:31.426 --> 29:34.452
- Is that what I'm looking at here?
- No.

29:34.529 --> 29:37.862
What they're pulling up is
Scully's correspondence back to Cobra.

29:37.933 --> 29:40.197
- She has a relationship?
- No. Somebody posing as Scully...

29:40.268 --> 29:43.465
who hacked into her computer
and has been capturing all her e-mail,

29:43.538 --> 29:47.599
passing themselves off as Scully
in order to win Cobra's trust.

29:47.676 --> 29:49.871
The last five exchanges
hinted a meeting...

29:49.945 --> 29:52.812
where they're gonna exchange information
on the project Cobra's working on.

29:52.881 --> 29:55.406
- A meeting? Where?
- [Frohike] Don't know.

29:55.484 --> 29:59.147
- They just ended.
- Who's been in her computer?

29:59.221 --> 30:01.587
Smoking Man,
or someone working for him.

30:01.656 --> 30:03.647
You gotta get to him now.

30:03.725 --> 30:06.592
You of all people should know
that you just don't get to him.

30:06.661 --> 30:10.495
If you don't get to him, it may be
the last time we see Scully alive.

30:17.906 --> 30:19.931
[Knocking On Door]

30:23.745 --> 30:25.975
We'll be getting fnal instructions
from our contact tonight.

30:26.047 --> 30:28.379
He's... He's invited us
to dinner.

30:32.087 --> 30:34.385
I took the liberty of
getting you something to wear.

30:38.326 --> 30:41.090
It's, uh...
It's beautiful.

30:41.162 --> 30:43.790
I'm glad you like it.

30:43.865 --> 30:46.129
I look forward
to tonight.

31:03.852 --> 31:06.320
##[Piano]

31:29.778 --> 31:33.009
- So your contact's going to join us?
- I presume so.

31:33.081 --> 31:37.848
You extol our great trust, but
you still haven't told me who he is.

31:37.919 --> 31:41.150
He is to human
genetic science...

31:41.222 --> 31:45.488
as Oppenheimer and Fermi were
to the advent of nuclear warfare.

31:46.962 --> 31:51.092
I'm still not clear what my
importance is to this exchange.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.936
This man...
We'll call him Cobra...

31:56.004 --> 31:58.199
he needs assurances...

31:58.273 --> 32:01.674
that the science he's gonna hand over
won't fall into the wrong hands.

32:04.879 --> 32:09.509
- I've told him of you.
He's expecting to meet you here.
- [Pouring Liquid]

32:13.088 --> 32:15.022
Well...

32:15.090 --> 32:17.024
to the future.

32:24.099 --> 32:26.033
I must tell you
something else.

32:28.637 --> 32:30.764
Something
that's so unbelievable,

32:30.839 --> 32:32.773
so incredible,

32:35.110 --> 32:37.635
that to know it is to
look at the entire world anew.

32:37.712 --> 32:39.509
What?

32:39.581 --> 32:44.177
What we are being given,
it's not the cure for cancer.

32:46.988 --> 32:49.286
It's the holiest
of grails, Dana.

32:52.193 --> 32:54.354
It's the cure
for all human disease.

32:57.832 --> 32:59.766
How?

33:01.936 --> 33:04.029
It's from that final frontier.

33:05.507 --> 33:07.441
It's largely
extraterrestrial.

33:14.449 --> 33:16.383
Then you would be cured.

33:17.886 --> 33:19.877
That which makes miracles...

33:21.489 --> 33:23.423
can also make great evil.

33:23.491 --> 33:28.019
There are those who would use
this power for their own purposes.

33:28.096 --> 33:31.361
To choose who will live
and who will die.

33:35.670 --> 33:38.161
Theoretically,
I can be cured, but...

33:38.239 --> 33:41.003
everything I've told you
about wanting to make right?

33:46.047 --> 33:48.277
I'm a lonely man, Dana.

33:55.790 --> 33:58.588
Would you excuse me?

34:41.469 --> 34:43.937
Cobra hasn't shown.

34:44.005 --> 34:47.065
- What do you wanna do?
- Wait. What else can we do?

34:48.777 --> 34:51.438
What trust you've won...

34:51.513 --> 34:53.639
Scully won't
stick around forever.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.919
What's wrong?

35:00.355 --> 35:02.289
Just do your damn job.

35:51.071 --> 35:54.131
Calico inlet's 15 minutes out.
South end.

35:54.207 --> 35:57.768
- What do I do when I get there?
- I don't know. Just wait.

36:02.048 --> 36:03.982
Be careful.

37:11.084 --> 37:13.018
Finally we meet.

37:13.086 --> 37:18.820
You're just as you described yourself.
Certainly more so last night at dinner.

37:21.795 --> 37:24.263
I only wish we could continue
to correspond,

37:24.331 --> 37:27.858
but it must end after this.

37:27.934 --> 37:30.266
I hope one day
we can take some time...

37:30.337 --> 37:32.328
when I'm not a marked man.

37:34.174 --> 37:37.200
This is it...
the science I promised you.

37:42.582 --> 37:45.517
Well, wait.
Where did you get this?

37:45.585 --> 37:48.418
- Where did it come from, this science?
- Where did it come from?

37:48.488 --> 37:51.685
- Who developed it?
- Scully?

37:51.758 --> 37:55.455
Yes, I'm Scully, but I don't believe
we've spoken before or corresponded.

38:11.978 --> 38:14.378
[Gunshot]

38:25.825 --> 38:27.588
[Gunshot]

39:19.846 --> 39:21.814
They shot him.
They killed him.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.509
And they shot at me.

39:26.419 --> 39:30.287
- Did you get it?
- You told me that
no one else knew about this!

39:30.356 --> 39:33.154
I wouldn't have sent you
if I thought there'd be any danger.

39:36.529 --> 39:39.498
Dana.

39:39.566 --> 39:41.500
Yes, I got it.

39:45.805 --> 39:47.739
Forgive me.

39:49.209 --> 39:53.543
Here. Take it.
This is for you.

39:53.613 --> 39:55.547
I gotta go.

39:58.818 --> 40:00.911
Go.

40:37.924 --> 40:39.858
There's nothing on this.

40:39.926 --> 40:42.827
- It's empty.
- Completely.

40:42.896 --> 40:45.797
No. It can't be.

40:45.865 --> 40:48.390
It can't be.

40:48.468 --> 40:50.402
It's got to be on there.

41:30.977 --> 41:33.741
He was here!

41:33.813 --> 41:38.147
These were his offices.
What the hell is this?

41:38.217 --> 41:40.412
He used you.

41:40.486 --> 41:42.647
Mulder, he laid it all out for me.
I recorded it.

41:42.722 --> 41:45.452
I mailed you the tape.

41:45.525 --> 41:48.494
This old woman, Marjorie Butters,
I met her.

41:48.561 --> 41:50.620
I saw her pictures,
her birth certificate.

41:50.697 --> 41:53.461
You saw what you needed to see
in order to make you believe.

41:53.533 --> 41:56.366
Well, then what about
this boy?

41:56.436 --> 41:59.428
This boy with cancer?
You can't deny that.

41:59.505 --> 42:02.099
That's...
That's undeniable proof.

42:02.175 --> 42:04.609
Even if we could convince his parents
to let us march him out,

42:04.677 --> 42:08.443
how long before that chip in his neck
mysteriously disappears?

42:08.514 --> 42:12.143
This was the perfectly
executed con, Scully.

42:12.218 --> 42:15.051
And the only thing I can't figure out
is why you're still alive.

42:16.556 --> 42:18.854
Mulder,
I looked into his eyes.

42:20.793 --> 42:23.193
I swear what he told me
was true.

42:33.673 --> 42:36.073
The man's motives
never changed.

42:36.142 --> 42:38.610
[Scully] You think
he used me to save himself...

42:38.678 --> 42:41.238
at the expense
of the human race?

42:41.314 --> 42:45.216
[Mulder] He knows what that
science is worth, how powerful it is.

42:45.284 --> 42:47.718
He'd let nothing
stand in his way.

42:47.787 --> 42:49.982
[Scully]
You may be right.

42:50.056 --> 42:53.116
But for a moment,
I saw something else in him.

42:53.192 --> 42:55.752
A longing for something
more than power.

42:57.030 --> 42:59.396
Maybe for something
he could never have.

44:21.278 --> 44:24.214
[Child]
I made this!
