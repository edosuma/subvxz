00:20.542 --> 00:23.762
When I was 10,
my sister was killed

00:23.806 --> 00:26.722
in front of me. My life
was never the same after that.

00:31.596 --> 00:35.035
And now, 9 years later,

00:35.078 --> 00:37.341
my life has taken another turn.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.822
It's become a living nightmare.

00:49.788 --> 00:53.314
Amber! Amber, January 25th.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.490
Died in a hit and run.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.753
Driver's name was... Ron Wilson.

00:57.796 --> 01:01.974
We were walking home from...
from where?

01:02.018 --> 01:04.890
Mrs. Cole's house,
the neighbor's.

01:07.328 --> 01:10.374
We were hit by a car
driven by Ron Wilson.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.594
We had just left Mrs. Cole's
house after dropping...

01:12.637 --> 01:15.945
- Tia! Tia!
- She was 17. She died.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.774
- What are you doing out here?
- I...

01:18.817 --> 01:22.082
- I wasn't feeling well.
- It's like 10 below.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.214
- Aren't you freezing?
- Yeah. I... I... just...

01:24.258 --> 01:26.434
I just thought
that the cold air would help.

01:32.179 --> 01:36.400
- Are you gonna throw up?
- I thought I was. I'm okay now.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.402
You're not pregnant, are you?

01:38.446 --> 01:40.535
I know you said you and Connor
aren't having sex yet,

01:40.578 --> 01:42.754
- but if you are, you can tell me.
- No.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.887
I just feel like you've been
acting different lately.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.586
We're not. I'm not pregnant.
I think it was something I ate.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.893
Well... Mr. Meyer saw you
outside the window

01:50.936 --> 01:54.070
and asked me to come
check on you. Do you...

01:54.114 --> 01:56.986
- feel like you can go to class?
- Yeah.

01:58.857 --> 02:02.034
Every day, it gets harder
and harder to be normal,

02:02.078 --> 02:04.472
to act normal.
I can hear things,

02:04.515 --> 02:07.039
smell things, taste things
a hundred times stronger

02:07.083 --> 02:09.172
than I ever could.
At the same time,

02:09.216 --> 02:11.392
I can feel my brain dying.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.785
My memories are slipping away
one by one.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.005
The older ones are the
hardest ones to hang on to.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.181
This means, pretty soon,

02:18.225 --> 02:20.575
all my memories of my
sister Amber will be gone

02:20.618 --> 02:22.968
and I can't let that happen.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.949
I started keeping a journal
to record

02:46.992 --> 02:48.777
everything that was going on,

02:48.820 --> 02:50.909
but with my sharpened sense
of hearing,

02:50.953 --> 02:52.998
it was becoming more difficult

02:53.042 --> 02:55.305
to concentrate.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.538
Emory!

03:12.235 --> 03:14.237
- Can't you read?
- I can read better

03:14.281 --> 03:16.239
than you can spell!

03:16.283 --> 03:18.502
- Why did you do that?
- I'm trying to concentrate

03:18.546 --> 03:21.288
- on homework.
- You can't even hear it!

03:21.331 --> 03:24.682
I'm gonna tell Mom you're
bullying me. Now, get out!

03:35.563 --> 03:38.043
Hey, sweetie!

03:38.087 --> 03:40.829
I brought you chicken
home for dinner.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.918
How are you?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.920
You still look a little tired.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.139
Don't worry, Mom.
I'm just going

03:47.183 --> 03:49.229
to the library to study.
It's hard to concentrate here.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.361
Is Emory bothering you again?

03:51.405 --> 03:55.539
He just doesn't understand
how important this year is

03:55.583 --> 03:58.368
- for you getting into college.
- No. He wasn't bugging me.

03:58.412 --> 04:01.328
I just... I'm distracted.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.766
The roads are slick.
I'd rather you stay home.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.725
Mom, I'll be careful.
We talked about this last week.

04:07.769 --> 04:11.599
I know. I know. It's just...

04:11.642 --> 04:16.255
It's just sometimes still hard
seeing you walk out the door.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.391
I sometimes still see her leave.

04:21.435 --> 04:24.089
I'll be fine.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.918
Get home early.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.051
I will. I love you.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.401
I love you too.
You forgot your coat again.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.366
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.846
- Bye.
- Bye!

04:44.632 --> 04:47.765
It's been tough trying to hide
my condition from my mom.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.029
I know that she's worried
about me.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.205
She's obsessed that something
is going to happen to me

04:53.249 --> 04:55.164
like it did with my sister,

04:55.207 --> 04:57.645
but I don't have the heart
to tell her it already has.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.356
Is it that hard
to get some new books?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.971
I spend half of my time trying
to be a normal teenager.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.583
Spend time
with my boyfriend Connor,

05:22.626 --> 05:25.455
study...
I still play basketball.

05:25.499 --> 05:28.458
The other half,
I spend researching.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.896
Trying to find a cure
for my... condition.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.431
- Hey, babe!
- Hey!

05:44.474 --> 05:46.781
- Why are you whispering?
- I'm in the...

05:46.824 --> 05:49.479
- the library studying.
- So...

05:49.523 --> 05:51.568
you still want to come around
tomorrow night, right?

05:51.612 --> 05:53.701
Seems like you haven't been
feeling too good lately.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.051
Yeah, of course.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.270
I already told you I wanted
to make your favorite meal.

05:58.314 --> 06:02.057
Would your feelings be hurt
if I suggested something else?

06:02.100 --> 06:04.059
- Like what?
- Well...

06:04.102 --> 06:07.105
Jason can get us into
Draxen Club with him and Sammy.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.281
You have to be 21.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.762
Not if the bouncer
owes you a favor.

06:11.806 --> 06:15.592
What do you think?
You said you wish we could go there.
We could double date.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.681
Um... Yeah, sure.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.292
It's... it's your day
so it's your choice.

06:20.336 --> 06:23.208
Of course, I'll be there. I want
to spend your birthday with you.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.428
Great. Awesome. I'll see you
tomorrow at school.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.430
This is gonna be awesome,
by the way!

06:27.474 --> 06:29.911
- Yeah.
- I love you, babe.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.526
Because everything
Jason does is awesome.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.984
- Happy birthday, babe!
- Best.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.813
Birthday. Ever.

07:04.859 --> 07:08.384
Look who's at the bar!
It's Riley.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.038
Riley?

07:10.081 --> 07:12.823
You met him at the mini mart
that one day.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.956
- You don't remember?
- No.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.698
OK, let's go say hi.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.351
Riles, Hey!

07:19.395 --> 07:21.310
Connor, man!
How are you doing?

07:21.353 --> 07:23.355
- What's up?
- I'm good, man.

07:23.399 --> 07:26.489
- Tina, right?
- Close. Tia.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.535
Right. Nice to see you again.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.886
Let me buy you guys
a drink.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.802
- A couple of beers is good.
- Alright.

07:34.845 --> 07:37.369
How did you guys get in here?
A couple of fake IDs?

07:37.413 --> 07:40.329
- No. My buddy Jason got us in.
- Jason?

07:40.372 --> 07:43.027
Jason Ellzey. He's here
with his girlfriend Sammy.

07:43.071 --> 07:46.422
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.251
I know him.
Just those two beers.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.123
- You can cash me out.
- Are you leaving?

07:52.167 --> 07:54.735
Yeah. I actually have work
early in the morning.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.041
- My girlfriend does too, so...
- Hey!

07:57.085 --> 08:00.088
Check to who
Connor's talking to.

08:00.131 --> 08:03.134
Interesting that he can afford
a night out,

08:03.178 --> 08:07.182
but he can't seem to pay you
the 3 grand he owes you.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.271
Let's say hi!

08:13.449 --> 08:16.017
Riley.

08:16.060 --> 08:19.455
Hey. What's up?

08:21.762 --> 08:24.373
Hey, sorry! The bathroom line
was super long.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.158
Hey, babe. Um, Connor, Tia,
this is my girlfriend Jasmine.

08:27.202 --> 08:31.249
- And this is Jason and his girlfriend Sammy.
- Hello.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.034
- Hey... Another round! On me.
- Don't worry about it. We were actually

08:34.078 --> 08:37.168
- just on our way out.
- Come on! It's early!

08:37.212 --> 08:40.823
- Girl time. Let's go dance.
- OK.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.703
Well, these beers
are going right through me.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.706
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- It's over there, man.

08:56.057 --> 08:59.930
Look, I'm gonna be real.
I'm offended.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.021
I was there for you when
you came to me and needed help.

09:04.065 --> 09:07.503
And then, I see you
out here clubbing it up

09:07.547 --> 09:10.332
with your girl.
It's almost like you don't feel

09:10.375 --> 09:12.334
responsibility to pay me back
in a timely manner.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.815
Jason, that is
a hundred percent not true.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.687
Things been really tough lately.

09:17.731 --> 09:22.039
Look, it's Connor's birthday,
OK? I'm here with my girl.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.433
Can we just talk
about this another time?

09:24.476 --> 09:27.044
Let's go have a cigarette.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.064
You're still driving
that blue Mustang?

09:47.108 --> 09:49.632
- Yeah.
- Great.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.200
Sign it to me,
we'll call it even.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.941
What?

09:53.984 --> 09:56.596
Where are the pink slips?
At your house?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.209
Dude, I'm not signing my car
over to you.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.777
That's crazy! I told you
I'd get you your money.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.605
Crazy?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.650
No... I didn't...

10:07.694 --> 10:09.086
I didn't mean crazy. I just...

10:10.653 --> 10:12.655
That car is worth like 8 grand.
I owe you 3.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.875
Perfect. You can
sell it to me for 5.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.054
Look, I gotta go, OK?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.972
- Itaking this seriously!
- What the hell? Get off me!

10:33.154 --> 10:35.765
You don't take advantage
of people who help you!

10:48.212 --> 10:51.955
Get up, brother.
Come on, Riley!

10:51.999 --> 10:54.479
Riley?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.090
Riley?

10:59.006 --> 11:00.747
Shit!

11:07.275 --> 11:09.669
Hey, Where's Riley?

11:09.712 --> 11:13.063
I don't know.
We were just over by the bar

11:13.107 --> 11:15.152
and then he took off
to take a call.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.200
So, how long have you two
been together?

11:19.243 --> 11:23.465
- Just a few months.
- How about another round?

11:23.508 --> 11:25.554
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go see

11:25.597 --> 11:28.035
where Riley snuck off to.

11:33.867 --> 11:37.087
Hey, Sammy... Let's go dance.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.573
What's going on?
You're acting weird.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.749
- Something is wrong with Riley.
- What?

11:46.793 --> 11:49.143
We were outside having
a smoke, talking about the money

11:49.186 --> 11:51.841
and then he copped an attitude,
and so I punched him.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.975
I knocked him to the ground and then
I kicked him and then he just...

11:55.018 --> 11:58.892
started coughing up blood
and... I don't know what to do.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.242
Okay, where is he?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.244
He's out back in the alley.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.691
Okay, this isn't
my fault, alright?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.041
I didn't mean to do it!

12:18.085 --> 12:20.740
He's alive, right?

12:24.526 --> 12:27.050
He's dead.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.704
Come on.

13:03.695 --> 13:07.395
Emory! Emory! Emory! God!

13:09.049 --> 13:11.703
Look at me! My God!

13:11.747 --> 13:16.012
You brat!

13:16.056 --> 13:18.319
Woah! What did you do
to your eyes?

13:18.362 --> 13:21.757
What did you do to your eyes?

13:21.801 --> 13:25.717
What is going on down here?

13:25.761 --> 13:29.591
He scared the crap out of me!
He was just laying here in the
dark with this fake blood.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.854
- Emory!
- It's just rubber.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.030
Dylan brought it
to class yesterday.

13:34.074 --> 13:37.947
Emory, what in the world
are you doing? It's not funny!

13:39.906 --> 13:42.299
- Go to bed.
- Jeez, none of you can take a joke.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.258
Why don't you ask Tia
about her eyes?

13:46.129 --> 13:48.653
I have no idea
what he's talking about.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.892
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:09.936 --> 14:13.330
What's up?
Is something... wrong?

14:13.374 --> 14:16.725
- Riley's dead.
- What?

14:16.768 --> 14:19.249
Yeah, they found his body
this morning behind a dumpster

14:19.293 --> 14:22.383
- at the club.
- My God!

14:22.426 --> 14:24.994
They don't have many details.
Apparently, it was a homicide.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.649
- How did you find out?
- Jason texted me

14:27.692 --> 14:30.957
like, five minutes ago.
I mean, the bouncer told him.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.351
It's horrible! He seemed
like a really nice guy.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.876
He was.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.008
Are you going to class?

14:39.052 --> 14:41.924
Yeah.
Yeah, I...

14:41.968 --> 14:44.187
guess I need to think
about something else.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.407
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll see you later.

14:48.757 --> 14:52.674
- Um... Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.937
It doesn't look
like you're doing too good.

14:54.981 --> 14:59.333
I haven't been sleeping a lot
lately, but... I'm okay.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.596
Seriously, I'm okay.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.033
Alright. Um...

15:04.077 --> 15:07.080
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

15:17.264 --> 15:20.876
Thanks for coming in.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.879
- I appreciate it.
- Of course. I mean,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.273
we still can't believe
that this happened.

15:26.316 --> 15:29.580
- Was he robbed?
- No.

15:29.624 --> 15:33.062
At least, he still had
his wallet and his cellphone.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.980
So...

15:38.024 --> 15:40.635
you were talking to the victim
and his girlfriend

15:40.678 --> 15:42.854
- inside the bar?
- Yeah.

15:42.898 --> 15:45.074
We didn't know
that he was gonna be there,

15:45.118 --> 15:47.250
but... when we saw them,
we bought them a round.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.079
After that, Jasmine said
you and she went over to dance

15:50.123 --> 15:52.603
and that was the last time
that she saw Riley

15:52.647 --> 15:54.823
- before the attack.
- That's right. We talked

15:54.866 --> 15:56.868
for a minute and then he said
he had to take a call

15:56.912 --> 15:59.262
and then he walked off.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.221
That was the last time
I saw him too.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.444
Good job, everyone.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.056
Now, I want you to move
the ovaries off to one side

16:10.099 --> 16:13.189
so you see the coil tubes
of the oviducts.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.845
Seriously?
Why can't we just

16:16.888 --> 16:19.065
do this on the computer?
I feel like we're in 1912.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.980
How do you not think
this is cool?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.897
Jesus, it's still alive!

16:25.941 --> 16:28.988
No, it's dead. It's dead.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.468
- Why the hell is it moving?
- A dead animal

16:31.512 --> 16:33.862
or a person can have
reflective muscle action

16:33.905 --> 16:35.995
up to 12 hours after death.

16:36.038 --> 16:39.085
- Can it still feel?
- No.

16:39.128 --> 16:42.479
Once the brain is dead,
there is no feeling at all.

16:42.523 --> 16:46.005
Did you see Riley talk
to anyone else?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.485
Actually... We...
Yeah, remember, we...

16:48.529 --> 16:50.879
We saw him talking
to that tall guy

16:50.922 --> 16:54.274
when we first came in.
I don't know who he is, though.

16:54.317 --> 16:58.408
- Tall guy?
- Yeah. Like, 6'2, 6'3 maybe.

16:58.452 --> 17:01.585
- Short, brown hair.
- That's right.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.935
Was it a heated conversation?

17:03.979 --> 17:06.721
Um... No,
it wasn't heated, but...

17:06.763 --> 17:08.983
it was intense.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.551
- What was this guy wearing?
- I think it was

17:11.595 --> 17:14.945
a black shirt.
I don't...

17:14.990 --> 17:18.166
really know, it was so dark
in there, it was hard to tell.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.560
And you'd never seen
this person before?

17:20.604 --> 17:23.172
No. But...

17:23.215 --> 17:26.480
I mean, we weren't really
thinking much of it.

17:26.522 --> 17:30.484
So, what happened?
I heard he got beat up.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.964
Official cause of death:

17:33.008 --> 17:36.142
internal bleeding
from a ruptured spleen.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.882
I see.

17:37.926 --> 17:43.062
Alright, well... Thanks.
If you think of anything else...

17:44.628 --> 17:46.978
- ...give me a call.
- Yeah.

17:47.022 --> 17:50.112
Definitely.

17:50.156 --> 17:54.029
Riley was a good friend.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.815
- I hope that you find who did this.
- I intend to.

18:04.953 --> 18:07.042
Hold up a sec!

18:14.223 --> 18:17.618
- Okay?
- Yeah.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.016
Hey, you know...

18:27.062 --> 18:29.020
I didn't think
I hit him that hard.

18:29.064 --> 18:32.198
You know,
to... rupture his spleen.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.243
I didn't even know that somebody
could die from that.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.724
Forget about it. Okay?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.987
She bought
the tall mystery guy story.

18:39.030 --> 18:43.165
Hey! We're gonna be okay.

18:49.998 --> 18:53.044
I'm thinking ahead.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.656
Actually, you know what?
I forgot something.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.248
I forgot something.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.250
- No worries.
- Bye.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.208
- Have a good day, Tia!
- You too.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.074
It was the strangest thing.

20:06.117 --> 20:08.598
I felt like I had
switched bodies.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.645
I could see what the frog saw
before its brain ended up in a jar.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.403
If I were surrounded by six
or eight of these things,

20:30.446 --> 20:32.883
would I stand a chance with
'em?- Well, there's no problem.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.537
If you had a gun, shoot them
in the head. That's a sure way

20:34.581 --> 20:37.105
to kill 'em. If you don't, get
yourself a club or a torch.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.760
Beat them or burn them.
They go up pretty easy.

20:42.763 --> 20:45.156
My God! It keeps dropping.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.304
The police told me last night

21:02.348 --> 21:04.698
that they were questioning
everyone who was at the club.

21:04.741 --> 21:08.049
You and your girlfriend
should go in voluntarily.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.312
We can't! We're underage.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.316
It's homicide. They're not gonna care.
They just want information.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.581
We don't have any. And besides,
I don't think he was involved.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.672
Hey, Jasmine.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.109
- Sorry about Riley.
- Thanks.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.808
Look, I don't mean
to bother you guys at school.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.245
I found out which one you go to
from social media.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.291
I was just gonna send you
a message, but...

21:32.334 --> 21:34.336
I thought it might be better
to come in person.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.034
She thinks Jason has something
to do with Riley's murder.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.341
- What?
- I don't know for sure, but...

21:39.385 --> 21:41.952
when Riley and Jason left
to go talk together

21:41.996 --> 21:44.955
while we were on the dance
floor, Riley seemed...

21:44.999 --> 21:47.654
- I don't know, really nervous.
- I'm telling you,

21:47.697 --> 21:51.135
- Jason would never do something like that.
- Look, all I'm asking

21:51.179 --> 21:54.443
is that you go to the police
and just tell them what you saw.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.967
- I saw them walk away together.
- Exactly. And then,

21:57.011 --> 21:59.056
Jason came back to the table
without Riley.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.885
Look, I'm not implying Jason had
something to do with this when he didn't.

22:01.929 --> 22:05.019
And besides, if the cops are wasting time looking
at Jason, they won't find the real killer.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.456
- No, the cops are gonna do their job.
- I'm sorry.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.198
If they ask if we were there
that night, I'm saying no.

22:14.855 --> 22:18.772
- Just tell them what you saw.
- Look, I'll talk to Connor. Here, what's your number?

22:22.819 --> 22:25.387
Riley was a great person.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.085
I wish you could've had
the chance

22:28.129 --> 22:31.306
- to know him better.
- Me too.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.308
Bye.

22:36.877 --> 22:39.096
Hey.

22:41.795 --> 22:46.365
- Hi.
- I saw you at the library.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.977
You were
researching the undead.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.850
Wow! Good memory.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.852
Do you always pay
close attention to what

22:55.896 --> 22:58.377
- other people are reading?
- No. I just have a passion

22:58.420 --> 23:01.467
- for zombies, so I took note.
- Really?

23:01.510 --> 23:04.644
What other passions do you have?

23:04.687 --> 23:08.299
A little of everything.
I guess I'm a bit of a polymath.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.301
I don't even know
what that means.

23:10.345 --> 23:13.087
You should learn it
before you take the SATs.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.917
I am... doing

23:16.960 --> 23:20.529
a... research project
on zombies.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.445
Do you think you could help me?

23:23.489 --> 23:26.883
- I could pay you...
- Yeah, sure.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.669
History
or anthropology?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.368
Your project,
what class is it for?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.414
Anthropology.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.680
- What's your name anyway?
- Flynn.

23:40.723 --> 23:44.031
Tia.

23:44.074 --> 23:47.251
I know. We had greek mythology
together freshman year.

23:47.295 --> 23:51.473
Right, yeah. Sorry, I forget
a lot of stuff lately.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.867
It's okay. I just have
one of those faces

23:53.910 --> 23:56.260
people tend to forget.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.180
- I won't hold it against you.
- Thanks.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.970
Hey, you know, those books
you got from the library,

24:10.013 --> 24:12.799
they're crap.
There's a better place

24:12.842 --> 24:14.975
- for information.
- Where?

24:15.018 --> 24:18.674
Well, if you meet me here
at lunch, I... I can show you.

24:18.718 --> 24:23.026
- Okay.
- Alright.

24:23.070 --> 24:26.334
See you after class.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.947
- So, where are we going?
- My house.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.689
Seriously?

24:33.733 --> 24:36.910
If you're trying to trick me into a
lunchtime hook-up, that's super lame.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.478
No, I... I...
I wouldn't do that.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.134
I swear.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.875
Trust me.

24:51.446 --> 24:55.232
Here it is.
Wait till you see my basement.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.979
I've been collecting
data on zombies

25:03.023 --> 25:06.548
and other paranormal stuff
since I was 6.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.898
This place is insane.

25:08.942 --> 25:13.163
- But... oddly inviting.
- Here, see.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.296
It's the Center
for Disease Control's

25:15.339 --> 25:17.559
preparedness guide
for the zombie apocalypse.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
This is real?
The US department

25:19.605 --> 25:22.782
- of Health and Human Services actually put this out?
- Yeah.

25:22.825 --> 25:26.394
Here. Cinematic History of Zombies...

25:26.437 --> 25:29.136
Globalistic Zombie Walks...

25:29.179 --> 25:31.442
Of course,
George Romero's biography.

25:34.097 --> 25:37.057
Why don't we start by
you telling me the real reason

25:37.100 --> 25:39.581
you're researching zombies?

25:39.625 --> 25:41.583
What do you mean?

25:41.627 --> 25:44.151
I can't help you
unless you're real with me.

25:46.893 --> 25:50.070
And I think if anyone
can help you, it's me.

25:53.464 --> 25:58.121
I'm trying to find a cure
for zombism and... soon.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.430
I knew there was something
I liked about you.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.320
So, how did it happen?

26:23.364 --> 26:26.106
You can't tell anyone this.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.238
You're the only person
who knows.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.545
I promise I won't tell anybody,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.503
but people are gonna
start noticing.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.505
I mean, you're already
starting to change.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.640
I'm not
a hundred percent sure, but...

26:38.684 --> 26:41.643
I think it happened last July

26:41.687 --> 26:44.037
in the parking structure
at the mall.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.392
Hi, kitty!

26:51.435 --> 26:54.090
Are you hungry, baby?

26:59.487 --> 27:01.707
Here you go.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.936
Is that crazy?
Because, to tell you the truth,

27:13.980 --> 27:16.417
I'm really scared.
Stuff keeps happening to me

27:16.460 --> 27:19.507
- and I can't stop it.
- What kind of stuff?

27:19.550 --> 27:21.596
My body temperature keeps
dropping every couple of days.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.294
I'm losing all my memories
and my coordination

27:24.338 --> 27:26.296
and eating and drinking
makes me sick

27:26.340 --> 27:29.169
unless it's brains.
Look, I... I wrote it all down.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.301
The only thing
that seems to be good

27:31.345 --> 27:33.564
is that I can hear and smell
better than I ever could

27:33.608 --> 27:35.697
and... I seem
to be getting stronger.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.749
Here. Bend this.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.276
Um...

28:04.334 --> 28:06.380
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Steven.

28:06.423 --> 28:09.600
- Who's Steven?
- He's someone you really need to meet.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.777
I'm gonna leave him a message,

28:11.820 --> 28:14.214
then we should really
get back to school.

28:17.826 --> 28:20.437
Sorry, I can...
I can roll it up.

28:20.481 --> 28:23.658
It's okay. I don't mind.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.890
I guess
we're a little late for class.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.196
It's okay.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.723
- Thank you. For today.
- Yeah,

28:44.766 --> 28:47.551
I'll keep your secret.
I swear on my life.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.467
Well... hopefully yours
is longer than mine.

28:52.295 --> 28:55.298
I'm gonna help you, you know?

28:55.342 --> 28:57.605
You're gonna be okay.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.786
So, um... I'll text you
when I hear back from Steven.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.704
Okay.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.751
Bye.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.281
Nice of you to join us.

29:21.324 --> 29:24.806
- Sorry.
- We were just talking about the frog's brain.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.462
Now, you notice behind
the cerebrum the optic globes.

29:30.029 --> 29:33.293
Now, what did you notice
about them, Tia?

29:33.336 --> 29:36.035
Um... That they were tangy.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.866
- Tangy?
- I'm sorry.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.738
I meant that
they were... tiny.

29:43.782 --> 29:48.090
Tiny... compared to...
the cerebrum and the medulla.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.832
Okay. Alright.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.052
So, people,
why do you think that is?

29:53.095 --> 29:55.445
Because frogs' eyes
use articular movement

29:55.489 --> 29:57.491
to accommodate. Like humans...

29:57.534 --> 30:00.320
...who can change the shape
of their lenses. Is that why?

30:00.363 --> 30:03.714
She's out of her mind.
Why would Jason beat up Riley?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.718
There could be a reason.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.896
- Like what?
- I don't know.

30:10.939 --> 30:14.508
Maybe... Riley owed Jason
money or something.

30:14.551 --> 30:17.554
Why would you even think that?

30:17.598 --> 30:20.470
Because I overheard them
talking about it.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.125
When? I was with you
the whole time.

30:23.169 --> 30:26.215
- I don't remember that.
- You were really drunk

30:26.259 --> 30:28.087
that night.

30:30.002 --> 30:33.005
No. No way.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.273
What's up with you
and that weirdo?

30:41.970 --> 30:44.886
- What?
- I saw you talking to him.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.889
Nothing. He just...

30:47.933 --> 30:50.283
He has research material
that I need.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.589
Just be careful.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.896
He's obviously into you.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.725
Why do you say that?

30:57.768 --> 31:00.293
Look at him. You're probably
the first hot girl

31:00.336 --> 31:02.034
that's ever given him
the time of day.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.603
- That's not very nice.
- Maybe not, but it's true.

31:12.783 --> 31:15.525
Jasmine thinks I had
something to do with it?

31:15.569 --> 31:17.484
That's what she said to me and Tia.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.616
- I told her she was crazy.
- I already told

31:19.660 --> 31:21.749
the lady detective that I saw
Riley talking to some guy.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.969
Jasmine wasn't with him,
so she probably didn't see it.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.363
What happened after you walked
away from the bar with him?

31:27.407 --> 31:29.365
Nothing happened.
What do you mean?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.977
He didn't, like... owe you
money or anything, did he?

31:32.020 --> 31:33.848
Where did you hear that?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.459
Tia just said that she might
have heard you talking about it.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.767
I was pretty wasted,
so I don't remember much.

31:39.810 --> 31:42.813
Tia's wrong.
I wouldn't say

31:42.857 --> 31:44.946
- anything like that.
- Yeah, I figured.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.079
It sucks, though.
I'll feel better once they catch

31:47.122 --> 31:49.255
- the real killer.
- Yeah. Me too, man.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.867
Me too.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.624
Living with this disease,

32:10.667 --> 32:14.062
I noticed that some days,
my symptoms would come and go.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.412
But sometimes, they'd take
a turn for the worse.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.675
I would crave animal brains
and by eating some,

32:18.719 --> 32:21.026
I'd get better
for a little while,

32:21.069 --> 32:24.812
but over time, my new diet
was becoming less effective.

32:24.855 --> 32:28.990
I had to eat more to keep
the symptoms... manageable.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.723
What is going on?

34:27.674 --> 34:30.024
- Hi, Mom.
- Tia, where are you?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.112
I'm okay, don't worry.

34:32.157 --> 34:35.029
Are you crying?
Where are you?

34:35.072 --> 34:39.033
I... I'm just at Connor's.
I'll be home in a bit, okay?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.208
No, no, no.
You need to leave now.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.429
Okay.

34:43.472 --> 34:47.389
Okay...

34:59.009 --> 35:01.447
I cannot believe
you would sneak out

35:01.490 --> 35:03.318
in the middle of the night and
not tell me where you're going!

35:05.712 --> 35:08.149
What if something
happened to you?

35:08.193 --> 35:10.586
You're right. I shouldn't
have done that. I'm sorry.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.198
You know who's out on the road
at this time of night?

35:13.241 --> 35:16.418
Drunks. I can't believe
you would risk your life

35:16.462 --> 35:18.507
for... for what?
To be with your boyfriend?

35:18.551 --> 35:21.641
I said I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

35:21.684 --> 35:24.600
- I'm not done talking to you!
- There is nothing left to say!

35:24.644 --> 35:26.950
In a split second,
your whole life could change.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.953
I know. I was there
when she got killed.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.608
Remember? But you spend
more time worrying

35:32.652 --> 35:35.089
about people dying than you do
actually enjoying your life!

35:35.133 --> 35:38.179
I won't live like that!
I can't.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.269
Life is too short.
Like I said,

35:41.313 --> 35:44.272
won't happen again.

35:46.013 --> 35:48.146
See, I'm not the only one
who does bad stuff.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.061
Go to bed.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.593
Hey, guys, guys, wait up!

36:00.636 --> 36:03.509
Hey!

36:03.552 --> 36:06.338
- Hey!
- Hi.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.645
- You ready for tonight?
- I'm sort of grounded.

36:09.689 --> 36:12.126
I have to go straight home
after school.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.651
- We were supposed to drive out and see Steven.
- I know.

36:15.695 --> 36:18.611
Anyway, you'd be willing
to cut class and go now?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.096
So what's this guy's story?

36:27.968 --> 36:30.449
I met him at a paranormal
convention a few months ago.

36:30.492 --> 36:33.103
He's looking for
the same thing you are.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.803
I should warn you, though.
He's further along than you.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.719
- Is he bad?
- He's coherent on the phone,

36:39.762 --> 36:41.590
so I don't know.

36:43.070 --> 36:47.553
- Why are you helping me?
- What do you mean?

36:47.596 --> 36:52.819
Just your interest in zombies
or are you just a humanitarian?

36:52.862 --> 36:56.257
If the situation were
reversed, would you do the same?

36:58.738 --> 37:01.262
Yeah.

37:01.306 --> 37:04.700
Then here's your answer.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.226
And you're sure she wasn't

37:08.269 --> 37:11.011
- at Connor's last night?
- I don't know!

37:11.054 --> 37:13.666
You know, it's just not like Tia

37:13.709 --> 37:16.146
to sneak out.
It's something Emory would do.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.279
But not her.

37:20.281 --> 37:23.110
Tia was doing that.
Remember when her father left

37:23.153 --> 37:27.288
- six or seven years ago?
- Yeah, but it's not just that.

37:27.332 --> 37:30.552
She's been acting strange
lately. Distant, you know.

37:30.596 --> 37:33.338
And she looks exhausted.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.427
Gaunt!

37:35.470 --> 37:37.429
It just feels like
there's something going on

37:37.472 --> 37:39.605
in her life right now and she's
not talking to me about it.

37:39.648 --> 37:43.609
Why don't you take her out?
Mother-daughter outing.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.307
Maybe she'll open up to you.

37:46.351 --> 37:49.267
Yeah, that's a good idea.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.230
How did you contract the...

37:56.274 --> 37:59.015
disease?

37:59.059 --> 38:01.627
I don't
know exactly.

38:01.670 --> 38:05.848
It might have been a dog that I tried
to help one night as I was coming home.

38:05.892 --> 38:09.374
He was hopping like he'd been hit by a car.
I tried to pick him up

38:09.417 --> 38:12.507
and put him in the back of my truck, but...
he bit me and ran off.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.336
Now, I heard about this lab

38:15.380 --> 38:17.469
that was doing research
on animals

38:17.512 --> 38:19.384
and they were injecting them
with a neurotoxin

38:19.427 --> 38:21.342
to see if they could
turn them into...

38:21.386 --> 38:22.909
zombies.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.306
Have you been able
to slow down the progression?

38:31.657 --> 38:34.703
I don't know.
What's typical?

38:42.494 --> 38:44.234
No blood.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.978
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's only gonna get worse.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.372
Memory loss,

38:51.416 --> 38:54.897
you'll find yourself coming out
of a catatonic state,

38:54.941 --> 38:58.553
you'll become
more... aggressive.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.037
I need to know what to expect,

39:04.080 --> 39:06.474
how much time I have.

39:06.518 --> 39:08.476
By month three, you'll have
bursts of strength.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.566
The cravings get so bad
you can't help yourself.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.221
Days pass without you knowing
what you did and...

39:14.264 --> 39:16.658
your flesh begins to rot

39:16.702 --> 39:19.226
and fall off.

39:21.228 --> 39:23.796
What did you mean by aggressive?

39:23.839 --> 39:26.581
Dangerous to other people?

39:26.625 --> 39:28.757
Well, not to others like us.
We're dying.

39:28.801 --> 39:32.979
To living people, yeah.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.416
You can almost smell
the fresh, wet brains

39:35.460 --> 39:38.637
inside of them.
And you want it so bad

39:38.680 --> 39:42.423
and you'll do anything to
get it. And after you're done,

39:42.467 --> 39:45.165
you get to experience their
memories for a short while.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.864
You almost feel human again.

39:48.908 --> 39:52.041
To feel blood pumping
through your veins...

39:52.085 --> 39:55.131
and a heart that beats...

39:56.829 --> 39:58.961
Hahaha! Yeah,

39:59.005 --> 40:01.442
it's why
I don't go outside anymore.

40:05.664 --> 40:08.971
What's that for?

40:09.015 --> 40:10.886
When I feel it coming on,

40:10.930 --> 40:14.368
I chain myself to the wall
so that I can't...

40:14.412 --> 40:16.892
hurt anyone.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.633
When I'm in that state, I don't
know where I've put the key.

40:18.677 --> 40:22.463
And when you come out of it,
you unlock yourself?

40:22.507 --> 40:25.335
As my brain continues to die,
I'll eventually stay in that state.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.469
And I'd rather starve and die
chained to a wall

40:28.513 --> 40:30.166
than to have that type
of existence.

40:30.210 --> 40:33.822
What happened to her?
Your wife.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.005
Let's go.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.533
Yes?

40:48.576 --> 40:55.453
Detective Berreiter,
Jasmine Mandeville is on line 6 for you.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.636
- Hey!
- Hey!

41:48.680 --> 41:51.509
- What are you doing home?
- Emory wasn't

41:51.552 --> 41:53.554
feeling well,
so I picked him up early.

41:53.598 --> 41:58.864
- Chicken and rice soup?
- Yeah. You know, does the trick.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.562
Mom, can you get my controls
down? I want to play a game.

42:01.606 --> 42:05.087
No. You need to go lay down.
I'll bring you soup in a minute.

42:15.794 --> 42:19.145
So I was thinking, let's you
and me go on a girls' weekend.

42:19.188 --> 42:21.103
Just mother-daughter.

42:21.147 --> 42:22.452
We'll go to a spa...

42:24.411 --> 42:27.632
Mom!

42:27.675 --> 42:29.634
- My God!
- Emory!

42:34.029 --> 42:36.728
I can't lift it. I need help.

42:38.164 --> 42:39.513
Tia!

42:39.557 --> 42:41.559
Move, Mom, move.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.087
Here.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.480
- Are you okay?
- My leg!

42:50.524 --> 42:52.874
God! Alright, we're taking
you to the ER. Here.

42:55.311 --> 42:58.663
Okay, just be very careful.

42:58.706 --> 43:01.666
Thank God these books
helped break the fall.

43:03.798 --> 43:06.714
At least it's just a bone
bruise and he didn't break anything.

43:09.325 --> 43:11.284
What happened back there?

43:11.327 --> 43:14.113
- Are you on drugs?
- What do you mean?

43:15.854 --> 43:17.638
You lifted that thing off him
like it was light as a feather.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.597
That happens sometimes!

43:19.640 --> 43:21.686
You hear about mothers lifting
cars off their kids and stuff.

43:21.729 --> 43:25.254
No. No, that's not what
that was. Your eyes changed

43:25.298 --> 43:29.215
color! Your...
your face changed.

43:29.258 --> 43:31.391
What was that?

43:31.434 --> 43:35.047
Tell me the truth.

43:35.090 --> 43:37.484
You won't believe me
if I tell you.

43:37.527 --> 43:40.226
You're my daughter, Tia.
I need to know what's going on!

43:43.621 --> 43:47.146
I contracted a condition that
slowly causes my brain cells to die.

43:47.189 --> 43:51.280
As I lose all my memories
and my motor skills,

43:51.324 --> 43:54.066
other senses increase.
There's not a cure

43:54.109 --> 43:56.677
as far as I can tell,
but I'm looking.

43:56.721 --> 43:58.940
That's not funny.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.377
Why would you tell me that?
You know how scared I am

44:01.421 --> 44:03.466
of something happening
to one of my kids!

44:03.510 --> 44:07.645
That's why I didn't
tell you, Mom. It's not a joke.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.255
From the shelving unit.

44:09.298 --> 44:12.171
- It never bled.
- My God!

44:14.521 --> 44:17.742
- You need to see a doctor.
- No! We can't see a doctor. If we talk to a doctor,

44:17.785 --> 44:21.310
they're gonna want to admit me and do
tests and I don't have time for that!

44:21.354 --> 44:23.922
If I don't find a cure
in three months,

44:23.965 --> 44:25.967
I'm not gonna be
the same person.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.670
It's your brother.
He... he's ready to see us.

44:39.285 --> 44:42.549
After I eat the brain,
I see all their memories.

44:45.421 --> 44:47.293
How is this possible?

44:47.336 --> 44:49.556
I'm trying to figure
that out myself.

44:51.514 --> 44:54.039
I wish you had told me.
I could have been

44:54.082 --> 44:57.216
- helping you.
- No, I didn't want to worry you, Mom.

44:57.259 --> 45:00.262
And to be honest, it's taken me
this long to fully understand

45:00.306 --> 45:04.136
- it myself.
- Who else knows?

45:04.179 --> 45:08.009
Just my friend from school.
He's been helping me research it.

45:08.053 --> 45:11.970
We're trying to track down a scientist
that may know where it all started.

45:12.013 --> 45:15.495
Of course. What else?

45:17.758 --> 45:20.239
Well... Just one thing.

45:21.806 --> 45:24.025
Have you ever been
to the 24-hour Korean market

45:24.069 --> 45:26.288
on 24th street?

45:28.551 --> 45:31.119
I mean, it's five star.

45:33.600 --> 45:37.560
Tia Scott and Connor
Foster, please come to the principal's office.

45:37.604 --> 45:40.389
- Were you two at the club that night?
- No.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.304
Who told you about that?

45:42.348 --> 45:45.830
Look... I know you two
are both underage,

45:45.873 --> 45:49.529
but I can assure you if you come forward
with whatever information you have,

45:49.572 --> 45:52.053
you won't be
in trouble for that.

45:52.097 --> 45:54.360
There's nothing to tell.

45:55.753 --> 45:59.365
We weren't there.

46:13.379 --> 46:14.772
Detective!

46:14.815 --> 46:17.513
- Tia?
- I need to talk to you.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.434
The night that Riley was killed,
I heard Jason Ellzey say

46:25.478 --> 46:27.697
that Riley owed him some money.

46:30.135 --> 46:33.442
- What else?
- That was it.

46:33.486 --> 46:35.531
Look, I'm not saying
that Jason did anything,

46:35.575 --> 46:38.970
but it could be a reason for them to...

46:39.013 --> 46:41.407
You know, fight.

46:41.450 --> 46:44.584
Thank you.

46:44.627 --> 46:47.456
- I'll keep in touch.
- Okay.

47:01.253 --> 47:03.603
I'm heading out for lunch. You want to come?

47:03.646 --> 47:06.736
No, thanks. I've... I've got an errand
actually that I need to run this afternoon.

47:06.780 --> 47:11.132
- Okay.
- Stef, I'm thinking about taking a week off.

47:11.176 --> 47:15.006
- How do you feel about handling things here?
- Good!

47:15.049 --> 47:17.225
- Are you going on vacation?
- I'm...

47:17.269 --> 47:20.315
taking your advice and I'm gonna
spend some time with Tia.

47:20.359 --> 47:22.448
Okay.

47:22.491 --> 47:24.537
Just get me up to speed

47:24.580 --> 47:26.582
- on the new hires before you go.
- Okay.

47:26.626 --> 47:29.411
We'll go over it tomorrow.

47:29.455 --> 47:31.500
Thanks, Stef!

47:31.544 --> 47:34.199
You're welcome.

47:38.377 --> 47:42.337
I couldn't find out anything about
that research lab Steven told us about.

47:42.381 --> 47:44.165
Me neither.

47:44.209 --> 47:47.516
I told my mom about what's
going on. She's looking too.

47:47.560 --> 47:49.562
You told her everything?

47:49.605 --> 47:53.871
I had to. It's getting
harder and harder to hide.

47:57.265 --> 48:00.007
Flynn, what if it doesn't exist
and we're just chasing our tails?

48:03.010 --> 48:06.666
I... I think I know someone
who could help us find out.

48:13.803 --> 48:16.154
- Hey, kid!
- Hey, Dad.

48:16.197 --> 48:18.939
This is the girl I was
telling you about, Tia.

48:18.983 --> 48:23.596
Hi, Tia. I'm Dr. Murson.
Why don't you... come with me?

48:31.430 --> 48:34.085
She's had these dark circles around
her eyes for about a week now.

48:34.128 --> 48:36.348
She just hasn't seemed herself.

48:36.391 --> 48:39.481
How is that possible?

48:49.013 --> 48:52.016
I'd like to do a full blood
panel if that's okay with you.

48:52.059 --> 48:54.496
- Yeah, of course.
- You can try.

49:00.328 --> 49:01.939
Tia!

49:01.982 --> 49:03.027
What are you doing?!

49:03.070 --> 49:04.289
My...

49:04.332 --> 49:06.334
God!

49:06.378 --> 49:08.641
I have never seen
anything like this.

49:10.599 --> 49:12.950
There must be
some medical explanation...

49:12.993 --> 49:15.822
There is.

49:15.865 --> 49:17.737
I'm a zombie.

49:22.872 --> 49:24.787
I'm sorry, honey.

49:24.831 --> 49:27.007
It's gonna be
another late night.

49:27.051 --> 49:28.748
Again?

49:28.791 --> 49:31.751
At least we got a break today
in the case.

49:31.794 --> 49:34.145
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

49:34.188 --> 49:36.930
A girl emailed me some photos
she took at the club

49:36.974 --> 49:39.889
the night our victim was killed.
Shows him walking

49:39.933 --> 49:41.891
away with someone.

49:41.935 --> 49:44.459
I need to go through the reports
and see if anyone we talked to

49:44.503 --> 49:47.462
- matches the description.
- Dinner's waiting for you.

49:47.506 --> 49:50.770
- I love you.
- Thanks, babe. I love you too.

49:50.813 --> 49:53.991
- Just leave it in the fridge, I'll warm it up when I get home.
- Okay. Bye.

50:00.519 --> 50:02.782
Well, the only lab nearby

50:02.825 --> 50:05.263
is about 90 miles from here.

50:05.306 --> 50:07.482
It's called Cordalas Research.

50:07.526 --> 50:11.008
It was bought by the university two
years ago and now it's a teaching lab.

50:11.051 --> 50:13.401
Well, don't you know
someone who works there?

50:13.445 --> 50:15.838
No, but I will get in touch
with them tomorrow.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.840
Isn't there anything
that you can do, though?

50:17.884 --> 50:20.495
I mean, to slow down
the progression?

50:22.280 --> 50:24.543
Until I understand what it is...

50:26.327 --> 50:27.589
...no.

50:57.576 --> 50:59.578
Ew! what are you making?
It smells gross.

50:59.621 --> 51:01.580
It's not for you, sweetheart.
It's for Tia.

51:01.623 --> 51:03.451
You're getting spaghetti.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.458
Why does she get
something different?

51:10.502 --> 51:14.593
Because she's on a special diet.

51:14.636 --> 51:18.031
- Are you hungry?
- No.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.120
Dr. Murson said you need
to keep your strength up.

51:20.164 --> 51:22.688
Dr. Murson?
Are you sick or something?

51:22.731 --> 51:25.691
What do you have?
Irritable bowel syndrome?

51:27.910 --> 51:30.043
Mwah! I love you.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.132
You need to go do your homework.
I'll let you know

51:32.176 --> 51:35.048
- when dinner's ready, okay?
- Nobody ever tells me anything.

51:37.790 --> 51:41.272
Did you print all these out for me?

51:41.315 --> 51:43.230
I mean, since brains
is all you can eat,

51:43.274 --> 51:45.580
I figured I didn't want you
to get sick of it.

51:45.624 --> 51:47.930
I love you.

51:47.974 --> 51:49.497
I love you too.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.164
- Do you like it?
- It's so good!
- Really?

52:07.124 --> 52:09.474
Flynn, hi!

52:09.517 --> 52:12.651
So my dad spoke to a woman from the lab
who was there when it was still Cordalas.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.957
I'll text you her number.
He said she'd be happy

52:15.001 --> 52:17.786
- to talk to you.
- That's amazing! Thanks!

52:17.830 --> 52:19.136
No problem.
Let me know what she says.

52:19.179 --> 52:20.746
I will.

52:23.836 --> 52:25.838
- We have a lead.
- I have a rush.

52:25.881 --> 52:31.757
The sample is... well, it's
small, but... do your best.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.846
Yeah, call me the moment
you have the results.

52:33.889 --> 52:37.066
And this stays between us.

52:37.110 --> 52:40.722
There's absolutely

52:40.766 --> 52:42.724
no animal testing at all
in this lab.

52:46.206 --> 52:49.166
But that neurotoxin project
you asked about,

52:49.209 --> 52:51.777
that was the last experiment
that used animals.

52:51.820 --> 52:53.909
University policy.

52:53.953 --> 52:56.260
And why was the
neurotoxin project abandoned?

52:56.303 --> 53:00.699
- Is it because the university bought the lab?
- Animal activists believed

53:00.742 --> 53:03.441
that our lead researcher
was illegally conducting...

53:03.484 --> 53:05.356
personal experiments
on the animals.

53:05.399 --> 53:08.446
They raided the lab
in the middle of the night.

53:08.489 --> 53:12.711
Hundreds of mice and rabbits were set
free and years of research was lost.

53:12.754 --> 53:15.670
What was the neurotoxin
experiment trying to find out?

53:15.714 --> 53:18.847
We were trying to develop
new anesthesia for surgery.

53:18.891 --> 53:21.981
The neurotoxin renders
most individuals catatonic.

53:22.024 --> 53:24.810
Combating unintended
intraoperative awareness.

53:24.853 --> 53:27.116
And... what is that?

53:29.031 --> 53:31.033
A small percentage of people
undergoing general anesthesia

53:31.077 --> 53:33.166
for surgery can actually
feel themselves

53:33.210 --> 53:35.473
being operated on.
But because

53:35.516 --> 53:37.910
of the muscle relaxers, they
aren't able to tell the surgeons.

53:37.953 --> 53:40.347
We believed our new anesthesia
would prevent that.

53:40.391 --> 53:42.915
- Were you the lead researcher?
- My goodness, no.

53:42.958 --> 53:44.917
No, that was...

53:44.960 --> 53:47.136
Dr. Michael Davrow was
in charge of that experiment.

53:47.180 --> 53:49.748
Is he here,
Dr. Michael Davrow?

53:49.791 --> 53:53.491
No. I'm afraid he was
let go after the raid.

53:53.534 --> 53:55.667
I guess the financiers
didn't like the publicity.

53:55.710 --> 53:59.018
Is there a number
so we could get a hold of him?

53:59.061 --> 54:01.499
Michael went into hiding.

54:01.542 --> 54:04.066
Several of us have tried
to find him over the years,

54:04.110 --> 54:07.461
but... no one has.

54:13.989 --> 54:16.470
- Hey!
- Hey!

54:16.514 --> 54:19.473
Do I still have a girlfriend?
I never get to see you anymore.

54:19.517 --> 54:21.954
Yeah, I've just been
really busy lately.

54:21.997 --> 54:24.435
Maybe you want
to grab burgers later?

54:24.478 --> 54:27.133
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

54:29.962 --> 54:32.007
- See you then.
- Bye.

54:39.276 --> 54:42.322
Hi! I'm trying to reach
Dr. Michael Davrow.

54:42.366 --> 54:46.326
Alright. Thank you.

54:46.370 --> 54:48.850
This man clearly doesn't
want to be found.

54:52.419 --> 54:55.335
Connor!

54:55.379 --> 54:57.990
- Hey! What are you... What are you doing here?
- You keep telling me

54:58.033 --> 55:01.254
how great this place is
and I was in the area.

55:01.298 --> 55:03.909
Hey, Tia.

55:03.952 --> 55:05.563
Hi!

55:05.606 --> 55:08.000
What were you doing in the area?

55:08.043 --> 55:10.698
Just some business.

55:10.742 --> 55:13.222
Mind if I join?

55:13.266 --> 55:15.703
Sure.

55:15.747 --> 55:18.184
OK, so you've never worked
at Cordalas?

55:18.227 --> 55:20.795
Sorry, wrong Michael Davrow.

55:20.839 --> 55:23.929
- Alright, thanks for your time.
- So, good news.

55:23.972 --> 55:26.018
The detective officially
cleared me.

55:26.061 --> 55:27.846
I gotta say,

55:27.889 --> 55:31.284
I'm so glad that's over.
I can't believe they'd think

55:31.328 --> 55:34.766
- that I'd be involved.
- Really?

55:34.809 --> 55:36.855
So Riley didn't owe you money?

55:36.898 --> 55:39.771
No.

55:41.425 --> 55:43.992
Excuse me. I need to go.

55:44.036 --> 55:46.386
Listen, you need
to stop saying things

55:46.430 --> 55:50.303
- you know nothing about.
- Maybe I know more than you think.

55:52.740 --> 55:55.221
Can I have my purse, please?

56:00.705 --> 56:03.664
- Tia, wait!
- How dare you set me up?

56:03.708 --> 56:06.493
I'd expect this from him
or... or Sammy,

56:06.537 --> 56:09.235
- but my own boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, okay? He just said

56:09.278 --> 56:12.891
he wanted to talk to you and he thought it'd be
easier if you just happened to bump into him.

56:12.934 --> 56:15.197
So what, you just lie to me and pretend
like this is some sort of date?

56:15.241 --> 56:19.245
No! I did want to spend time with you.
It's a rare occurrence these days.

56:19.288 --> 56:22.204
- You seem to be spending a lot of time with your other boyfriend.
- Don't flip this!

56:22.248 --> 56:24.729
I didn't fake a date so you
could be accosted by my friend.

56:24.772 --> 56:27.558
- No, you just lie about other things.
- Like what?

56:27.601 --> 56:29.777
I'm not even sure!

56:29.821 --> 56:32.432
All I know is that there's
something you aren't telling me.

56:32.476 --> 56:35.609
Look, you've been weird and
distant the last couple of weeks.

56:35.653 --> 56:38.307
If you want to be with that Flynn
weirdo, then just be honest about it.

56:38.351 --> 56:41.006
He's not a weirdo.
You don't even know him.

56:41.049 --> 56:44.096
- You seem to know him well.
- Yeah, and I thought I knew you really well.

56:55.673 --> 56:59.764
I never should have let you talk
me into this, man. Now she's pissed!

56:59.807 --> 57:03.811
If anyone should be pissed, it's me. She's
been making up stuff and going to the cops!

57:03.855 --> 57:07.598
I don't know what's gone into her, man.
She's acting so bizarre lately.

57:07.641 --> 57:11.340
- Bizarre?
- Here you go. Enjoy.

57:13.168 --> 57:16.911
She keeps ditching class,
avoiding me, and she sneaks off

57:16.955 --> 57:19.958
with this creepo kid
named Flynn.

57:20.001 --> 57:22.482
She says they're working on a project
together, but I question it.

57:22.526 --> 57:26.051
- What all do you know about this Flynn guy?
- Flynn Murson.

57:26.094 --> 57:30.708
He's like the kid that has no friends. He just
sits by himself all day wearing all black.

57:30.751 --> 57:33.841
It blows my mind that
she'd cheat on me with that!

57:35.756 --> 57:39.020
Well... maybe you two
should take a break.

57:41.109 --> 57:43.068
Clear your head.

57:45.592 --> 57:46.985
Maybe.

57:55.428 --> 57:58.300
- Hey!
- She's gonna be a problem.

57:58.344 --> 58:01.216
So what do you want to do?

58:08.136 --> 58:12.489
- What's this?
- Banana smoothie. Extra protein.

58:14.969 --> 58:16.493
Okay...

58:27.199 --> 58:29.854
Thank you!

58:34.946 --> 58:38.166
Hello?

58:38.210 --> 58:42.388
Hi, this is Dr. Davrow.

58:42.431 --> 58:46.610
- Hi, is this the Dr. Davrow from the Cordalas lab?
- Yes.

58:46.653 --> 58:49.917
- Thank you so much for calling me back. I think we've got him.
- My pleasure.

58:51.789 --> 58:53.878
Are you sure

58:53.921 --> 58:56.010
- you don't want me to come with you?
- No, it's okay.

58:56.054 --> 58:58.796
I'll call you and let you know
what we find out.

58:58.839 --> 59:01.102
Maybe we can put Dr. Davrow
in touch with your dad

59:01.146 --> 59:03.540
- and he can explain some of this stuff to him.
- Yeah.

59:03.583 --> 59:06.455
Well, he made copies of all
your notes, he's working on it.

59:06.499 --> 59:08.719
I'll bring you your notebook
back tomorrow.

59:08.762 --> 59:10.764
Alright.

59:10.808 --> 59:13.332
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

59:51.500 --> 59:54.895
- Emory! What are you doing in here?
- I'm scared.

59:54.939 --> 59:57.637
Do you want me to check
your room for the boogeyman?

59:57.681 --> 59:59.030
Very funny.

01:00:00.945 --> 01:00:03.512
Come here.

01:00:06.472 --> 01:00:09.997
- What are you scared of?
- Something bad is going on

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:12.130
and nobody's telling me
what it is.

01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:15.220
I live here too.
I have a right to know.

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:19.311
I don't want you to worry, okay?

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:22.923
I'm just going through something
right now that you may not...

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:25.796
understand until you get
a little bit older.

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:29.364
Tia, I love you and I don't
want anything to happen to you.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.631
Come here.

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:47.992
No, it's okay, I'm fine. You can
all stop worrying about me.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:51.343
- T, it's freezing outside.
- What did you come

01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:54.128
all the way in the middle of
the night to tell me, Connor?

01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:57.175
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:59.438
You said that over text.

01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:02.702
You didn't
respond. Look,

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:05.487
I used bad judgment, okay?

01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:09.796
Jason was hounding me to talk to you, and
you're right, I shouldn't have misled you.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.714
It's just one mistake. Nothing's
worth ruining our relationship over.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:17.021
It's not just one thing.

01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:19.632
It's not just about the whole
Sammy and Jason thing.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:23.462
- What do you mean?
- Look,

01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:25.899
you tried to get me
to lie to the cops.

01:01:25.943 --> 01:01:29.729
That's not how I operate, and I didn't
think that's how you did, either.

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:32.514
- I just didn't want us to get into trouble.
- You didn't want Sammy

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:37.258
- and Jason to get into trouble.
- They're my friends!

01:01:37.302 --> 01:01:40.261
So was Riley.
And now he's dead.

01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:43.134
Look, you and I are just...

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:45.136
life is too short

01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:48.008
to be wasting it on
partying all the time.

01:01:48.052 --> 01:01:50.619
And I don't like
how you judge people.

01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:53.057
The more I get to know you,
the more I realize

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.495
that you and I are just too
different to make it work.

01:01:58.453 --> 01:02:01.369
Don't say that, Tia.
We're good together.

01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:04.024
- You know that.
- No, we're not.

01:02:04.068 --> 01:02:07.506
And you're sure
this is what you want?

01:02:09.377 --> 01:02:12.206
Change your mind.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.740
Alright. I guess I'll...
see you around.

01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:43.194
Um, evidence of a virus...

01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:45.892
but the type is unknown.

01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:49.766
Result summary. Subject
appears to be contaminated

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:52.551
with blood of a non-human,
perhaps animal in origin?

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:56.773
Diagnosis inconclusive.

01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:33.722
- Hey, you! It's Flynn, right?
- Yeah?

01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:35.942
Hop in. I'd like
to talk to you.

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:39.424
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of Tia's.

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:42.166
OK, well, what do you want?

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.603
Just get in the car.

01:03:44.646 --> 01:03:47.214
Don't say anything,
get in the car now.

01:03:52.698 --> 01:03:54.656
You know, you can make this
stop right now.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.834
I told you, I don't know anything
about a murder investigation!

01:03:57.877 --> 01:04:01.750
- She never said anything.
- Yeah, what doyou know?
- Nothing I'd tell you.

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.627
Did she go to the cops?

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:13.197
What's this?

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.330
What are these?

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.158
Nothing, just schoolwork.

01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:21.248
Really? It doesn't look
like schoolwork to me.

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:26.253
Whatever, man.

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:58.024
- She's not alone.
- That's okay.

01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:01.245
Just follow them.

01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:33.059
I'll be back.

01:05:33.103 --> 01:05:35.801
- Dr. Murson.
- Dad,

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:38.673
- it's me.
- Hey, kiddo. Where are you? Are you at school?

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:42.373
No, some guy
was looking for Tia.

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:44.636
He drove me out here, took my phone.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:48.248
I need you to come pick me up, or I
could take a cab to school, get my car.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:51.686
- I just don't have any money.
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.341
I'm fine. I'm just...
at a bar.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:57.910
- The Eagle Pen, downtown.
- Okay, I'll send a cab to pick you up.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.739
Okay, thanks.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.756
Mom, what if he doesn't have
the answers?

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.977
Well, then he can help us find them.

01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:33.990
- Mom, can we stop and use the bathroom?
- Yeah, sure.

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.363
I already hated Jason
for what he did to Riley,

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:47.976
but when I realized he'd done something
to Flynn, I pretty much lost it.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.763
Every time I'd started to cross the line
before, I was able to pull it back.

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:54.157
But this time, I didn't want to.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.117
Where's Flynn? What
did you do to Flynn?!

01:07:58.161 --> 01:07:59.814
Where is he?

01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:06.430
You better hope he's okay, because if
he isn't, I'm going to hunt you down,

01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:09.955
tear at your throat, reach inside
your skull and take out your brain

01:08:09.998 --> 01:08:13.698
- with my bare hands. Got it?
- He's fine!

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:35.937
Hey, is the bathroom clean?
I think I'm gonna use it before we hit the road.

01:08:35.981 --> 01:08:38.157
Yeah, actually, no, they're
not working. Plumbing problem.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:40.768
We'll just stop at
the next one. Let's go.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:01.136
Tia?

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:04.183
My God, your eyes!

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:07.229
It's happening more and more.

01:09:16.238 --> 01:09:19.502
You got your phone back?

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:22.027
Dr. Murson, it's Tia.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:24.943
- Tia? Are you with Flynn?
- No,

01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:28.468
but I think that he might be
hurt. I found his phone

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:31.341
with these two people I know and...
I don't know what they did to him.

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:34.996
He's fine. I spoke
to him a while ago.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.216
I was just... I just
wanted to make sure.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.957
- Who are these guys, Tia?
- They're friends

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:43.048
of my ex, Connor. It's a long
story, I'll tell you later.

01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:48.184
- Okay. You be careful.
- I will.
- What's going on?

01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:52.492
- Did Connor's friends steal Flynn's phone?
- Connor's friends

01:09:52.536 --> 01:09:55.539
- murdered someone.
- What?!
- Mom,

01:09:55.582 --> 01:10:00.196
- look at the road. I'll tell you the whole story.
- My God!

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:23.784
I think this is it.

01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:26.091
This looks like the house.

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:42.890
- Hi.
- Please, come in.

01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:53.858
So... you need to know
what happened

01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:56.295
and how to cure it.

01:10:56.339 --> 01:11:00.821
Two years ago, I was
hired to head up

01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:04.390
a privately funded project
to test the effects

01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:07.828
of neurotoxins as a component

01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:11.092
of... of...

01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:15.227
Sorry.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.491
- Yes. Anesthesia.
- That was the project

01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:21.494
- that was shut down.
- Exactly.

01:11:21.538 --> 01:11:25.759
The lab was raided by activists.

01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:28.066
All the animals escaped,

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:32.113
including a particular rat
that I'd been working with.

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:34.725
Galvani.

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:37.597
Galvani was technically part

01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:40.034
of the experiment,
but I'd been doing

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:43.168
additional research on him.

01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:46.302
No one at the lab knew about it.

01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:49.000
On a trip to Haiti,

01:11:49.043 --> 01:11:51.611
I procured

01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:54.222
a different neurotoxin
than what we were using.

01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:56.703
What kind of neurotoxin?

01:11:56.747 --> 01:11:59.880
One that had traces

01:11:59.924 --> 01:12:02.230
of human remains
and was believed

01:12:02.274 --> 01:12:04.885
to be the toxin

01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:07.366
used by voodoo priests

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:10.978
- to create...
- What?

01:12:11.022 --> 01:12:13.720
Zombies.

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:16.419
I didn't know the effect

01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:18.812
until almost a year later,

01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:23.904
when I realized that
it had caused a...

01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:26.429
a mutation!

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:31.303
It had caused
a mutation in Galvani,

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.740
making him susceptible
to what is known

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:36.743
as the zombie virus.
When he bites,

01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:40.399
the toxin

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:43.750
that now lives inside him...

01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:45.709
is transferred.

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:48.929
To people?

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.240
There's no cure.

01:12:57.285 --> 01:13:00.985
But I believe I've
discovered a way

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.943
to stop the disease
in its tracks.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:05.555
I've been waiting

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:08.209
almost two years

01:13:08.253 --> 01:13:10.342
for another infected person
to come to me

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:16.043
- so that I could try it out.
- Well, why don't we try it on her now?

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:19.830
- I can't.
- What do you mean? Why not?

01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:23.790
I don't know it anymore.

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:26.097
One year ago,

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.534
I was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

01:13:28.578 --> 01:13:32.973
I lose more memories every day.

01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:35.454
The antidote

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:38.326
is one of those memories
that's gone.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:42.548
- So you had the cure and now you don't?
- It's not gone forever.

01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:45.464
The knowledge exists.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.946
It's locked inside my brain.

01:13:48.989 --> 01:13:51.383
I just can't access it.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:55.561
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:59.347
How does this help us?

01:14:02.263 --> 01:14:04.831
You know what I'm thinking,
don't you?

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.662
You know how to access
my memories.

01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:11.838
If you...

01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:14.754
I'm not going to eat your brains,
if that's what you're implying.

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:17.931
What choice do you have?

01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:21.500
mean, it's gotta be somewhere,
somewhere in this house.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:26.374
- We can help you find it. We can look.
- Kate, I'm dying.

01:14:26.418 --> 01:14:29.203
It's not just the Alzheimer's.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:31.467
I've got stage 4 lung cancer.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:34.861
When I go, that
knowledge goes too.

01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:38.256
Your daughter doesn't
have much time.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:41.564
There has to be another way.

01:14:51.269 --> 01:14:53.532
No, no, no! What are you doing?

01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:58.058
I'm not gonna murder

01:14:58.102 --> 01:15:00.365
and eat you. There has
to be another way.

01:15:00.408 --> 01:15:05.718
There isn't. You can save your
own life, Tia. Once I'm dead,

01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:08.504
break open my skull without
destroying the brain tissue.

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:11.245
- No. No way.
- Eat slowly.

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:13.639
Once you remember the formula,

01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:16.686
a doctor should be able to get
you what you need to create it.

01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:21.212
- I'm not a murderer.
- I'll make it easy for you, then.

01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:23.519
How do you know
it's gonna even work?

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:26.347
You'll have access
to all my memories.

01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:30.090
- You just need to concentrate.
- Sorry

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:34.094
to break up the party, but we have
to have a few words with Tia.

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:36.836
You're not having words with
anyone. Get out of my house!

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.536
Get out of the way, old man.
Don't make me kill you.

01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:44.278
Move!

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:54.375
- You should've kept your mouth shut.
- No, Tia!

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:01.426
- You really think you can kill me?
- What the hell?

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:20.924
- Mom?
- It's fine. It just grazed me.

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:25.798
You know what I have to do.

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.805
Okay...

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.676
Trust me, with the Kung Pao sauce, you won't
be able to tell the brain from the chicken.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.809
Eat, Tia. Come on, sit up.

01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:23.508
There you go.!

01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:28.034
That's okay. It's okay. Just use
your fingers. Use your fingers.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.911
Focus, Tia. Focus.

01:17:34.954 --> 01:17:38.523
Focus. Focus. Listen
to my voice, Tia.

01:17:38.566 --> 01:17:41.221
Remember the day he was
creating the antidote, okay?

01:17:41.265 --> 01:17:43.746
He must have been
using a microscope.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:48.751
The virus was dying.
Come on, focus. Focus, Tia.

01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:53.494
- The virus was dying.
- The antidote is one of those memories

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:56.672
that's gone.

01:17:56.715 --> 01:17:59.936
It's not gone forever.
The knowledge exists.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:04.244
It's locked inside my brain.

01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:06.769
I just can't access it.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:14.254
I got it! I got it!

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:18.781
Salicylate, capsaicin...

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:22.001
- What else?
- Prilocaine, hydrochloride...

01:18:22.045 --> 01:18:26.832
Prilocaine, hydrochloride, what else,
Tia? Tia, focus. Flynn, what's going on?

01:18:28.138 --> 01:18:31.924
Hey, hey, hey... It's okay.

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:36.102
- Your mom's okay, everything's fine.
- Tia, focus. What else?

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:38.975
Two part prilocaine,

01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:42.152
hydrochloride...

01:18:42.195 --> 01:18:45.198
What else, Tia?

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:48.680
What else?

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.995
Thank God.

01:19:47.913 --> 01:19:51.003
Welcome back.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:20:00.143
Come, sit.

01:20:00.186 --> 01:20:02.580
Here we go.

01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:04.625
Just got one more
little thing I gotta do.

01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:07.628
Finger...

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:10.980
Great, thank you.

01:20:11.023 --> 01:20:13.852
This won't hurt a bit.

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.997
Where's Flynn?

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.651
He went to talk to your brother.

01:20:30.695 --> 01:20:33.698
Emory's gonna spend the night
at his friend's house.

01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:36.396
- Don't worry, he's fine.
- Okay.

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.751
I'm so glad to see you.

01:20:43.795 --> 01:20:46.711
That stuff he gave you worked.

01:20:46.754 --> 01:20:51.368
The antiviral drug he gave me won't
eliminate the virus altogether,

01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:54.414
but it'll stop it from
reproducing and evolving.

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:57.330
You have to give me a boost
every couple of weeks.

01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:59.680
And if you do it
that way, you feel normal?

01:21:04.598 --> 01:21:07.993
It's Detective Berreiter. She has
both Sammy and Jason in custody.

01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:11.910
Thank God!

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:20.832
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.791
- How's Emory?
- He's okay.

01:21:23.835 --> 01:21:26.882
He fell asleep before I left.

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:30.102
It's cool that you went
to go talk to him.

01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:36.674
- I think this belongs to you.
- Yes. Thanks.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.766
Thank you.
For everything.

01:21:41.809 --> 01:21:44.551
Come on, I didn't do much.

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:48.468
Are you kidding me? If it
weren't for you and your dad,

01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:52.298
my mom would be dead
and I would be a zombie.

01:21:55.823 --> 01:21:58.435
So, what now?

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:01.264
What do you mean?

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:05.181
We just go back to school
and pretend nothing happened?

01:22:07.183 --> 01:22:09.620
I won't tell if you don't.

01:22:09.663 --> 01:22:12.536
I was talking about us.

01:22:12.579 --> 01:22:16.453
I... I thought
you were with that guy.

01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:19.847
That didn't work out.

01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:22.720
Yeah, why not?

01:22:22.763 --> 01:22:25.636
Because I think I found
someone I like better.

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:28.421
Yeah, who's that?

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:32.948
Before I answer that,
I have a question for you.

01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:37.691
Have you ever been
kissed by a zombie?

01:23:01.019 --> 01:23:03.021
Hey, guys!

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:06.982
Okay, one for you...
one for you.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:09.854
- Thanks, Mom.
- So you guys are gonna be careful

01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:12.117
on your hike, right?
You took the whistle?

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:16.034
Yes. I have a flare, the first
aid kit, the antivenin

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:19.342
- and my cell phone. We'll be fine.
- Okay. I know you will.

01:23:19.385 --> 01:23:22.127
Are you sure you don't wanna
come with us, Mom?

01:23:22.171 --> 01:23:24.434
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah, just come.

01:23:24.477 --> 01:23:26.479
You know, maybe I will.

01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:29.265
- You will?!
- Really?!

01:23:29.308 --> 01:23:32.659
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I will.

01:23:32.703 --> 01:23:35.967
- Alright. You can wear my old hiking boots.
- I have an extra backpack.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:40.276
- Come on, Mom, let's go!
- Alright.

01:23:50.764 --> 01:23:55.508
Sometimes it takes one
tragedy to heal from another.

01:23:55.552 --> 01:23:57.902
Some of my memories have
disappeared forever,

01:23:57.945 --> 01:24:01.993
like the hit-and-run that killed my
sister, but I still have some of her

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:05.170
still alive, and those
are the ones

01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:07.781
- I'd rather hang on to.
- How do I look?

01:24:07.825 --> 01:24:10.088
Great!

01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:13.222
- Let's go hiking, people.
- Okay.
