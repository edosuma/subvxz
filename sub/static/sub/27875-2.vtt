take the lead on this one.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.236
- Out of the other
two teams, Zahida,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.238
which way do you think
we should go?

19:00.306 --> 19:04.208
- It's obvious to me I would
pick Ashley, Zoe, Amanda,

19:04.277 --> 19:05.543
'cause Ashley
has a lot of issues

19:05.612 --> 19:07.245
with people in the house,

19:07.313 --> 19:10.114
and I know you have
your issues with Hunter,

19:10.183 --> 19:12.583
but, like,
it's Georgia's first week,

19:12.652 --> 19:15.153
and, like, that's
who me best friend is in here.

19:15.221 --> 19:18.489
- Zach, do you concur?
- Whatever she says.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.657
- Ooh.
- Wow.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.225
- Ooh, whipped, I see.
- Wow.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.162
- Zach turned into a bitch.
- [inaudible] Zach.

19:24.230 --> 19:27.932
- Matches the shirt.
- I think Amanda's just jealous

19:28.001 --> 19:30.968
that Zach is letting his
female partner take the reins.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.970
- We'll see how long
that lasts.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.674
When it comes to voting,
we'll see where it goes.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.610
- I know how evil
and nasty Amanda is,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.847
and all she's trying to do
is to get a rise out of me,

19:42.916 --> 19:44.749
and I'm just gonna sit there,

19:44.817 --> 19:47.652
I'm gonna smile, and I'm gonna
walk away from it.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.320

- All right. See you.

more respect on his name,

24:39.545 --> 24:42.112

37:33.719 --> 37:36.987
- Georgia pulls off one of
the most epic upsets

37:37.055 --> 37:38.555
in "Challenge" history.

37:38.624 --> 37:41.458
Already rookie
of the year nominee.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.760
- [inaudible].
<i> - I guess now I have someone</i>

37:43.829 --> 37:47.430
who's already an enemy of mine
as an enemy back in the house.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.532
<i> I'm always swimming</i>
<i> against the tide.</i>

37:49.601 --> 37:50.900
- Yes!

37:55.340 --> 37:56.973
<i> I've been</i>
<i> a competitor my whole life,</i>

37:57.042 --> 37:58.708
and I've always had a chip
on my shoulder,

37:58.777 --> 38:01.544
and that's the one thing
I could always be proud of,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.613
was the [bleep] chip,
that dig deep inside

38:03.682 --> 38:05.382
that nobody can beat you,
that you're the man,

38:05.450 --> 38:07.317
<i> and she took the money from</i>
<i> me,</i>

38:07.386 --> 38:08.952
<i> but when she took that,</i>
<i> she took that chip,</i>

38:09.021 --> 38:11.488
that inner demon that
I've always had, and tonight...

38:11.556 --> 38:13.223
- It's back.
- Tonight I got it back.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.091
- I told you I was gonna
get it back for you.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.695
- And now I got it back,
and I could not be happier.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.802
- Hunter and Georgia getting
the job done tonight.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.170
Congratulations.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.639
[cheers and applause]

38:29.708 --> 38:32.175
So, Hunter,
Ashley took your money.

38:32.244 --> 38:35.145
You took her game.
Nice work, man.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.414
- All right.
- That's still not fair.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.949
<i> - You just won</i>
<i> the previous season,</i>

38:40.018 --> 38:42.285
and then you got beat
by a rookie.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.254
<i> That's a hard pill</i>
<i> to swallow, champ.</i>

38:44.323 --> 38:46.956
I'ma go get you some water.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.225
- So, Chase and Ashley,
you guys

38:49.294 --> 38:52.028
are the first casualties
on the killing floor.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.296
Take care of yourselves.
Have a good one.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.198
- Good job.
- Well done, guys.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.667
<i> - So I'm going back into</i>
<i> this house without Ashley.</i>

38:57.736 --> 38:59.436
Now I don't have power.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.271
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> what's gonna happen,</i>

39:01.340 --> 39:03.873
but I just hope Hunter can
forgive us for voting him in.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.342
[cheers and applause]

39:05.410 --> 39:08.311
- Oh, Lord,
I just hate to lose.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.946
<i> Not only are we out</i>
<i> of the game now.</i>

39:10.015 --> 39:12.048
<i> All of my alliances</i>
<i> are gonna be out of the game</i>

39:12.117 --> 39:14.217
<i> on by one,'cause they don't</i>
<i> have a pot to piss in.</i>

39:14.286 --> 39:17.087
They're pretty much [bleep].
I'm [bleep].

39:17.155 --> 39:18.688
I'm on my way back
to the States.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.390
I'm pissed, but I'm sure

39:20.459 --> 39:23.460
<i> I'll be talking to Hunter</i>
<i> and Amanda pretty soon.</i>

39:24.629 --> 39:27.931
- I'm [bleep]. I think
that Hunter's gonna gun for me,

39:27.999 --> 39:29.666
and he's not gonna forget this.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.435
<i> This guy holds a grudge,</i>
<i> and he's emotional as [bleep].</i>

39:32.504 --> 39:34.738
I'm in a really
messed up situation.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.740
- All right, so,
Hunter, Georgia,

39:36.808 --> 39:40.110
now the game is gonna get
switched up a little bit.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.712
There's just
another little twist.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.782
This is a relic.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.385
<i> Next on "The Challenge"...</i>

39:48.453 --> 39:49.152
<i> Next on "The Challenge"...</i>

39:49.221 --> 39:50.920
- Kill each other!

39:50.989 --> 39:54.524
[all shouting]

39:54.593 --> 39:56.726
- If I go in, I'm gonna
[bleep] stab a bitch

39:56.795 --> 39:57.761
in the [bleep] throat.

39:57.829 --> 39:58.928
- I'm not scared.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.364
You can come for me all you
want.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.066
- I didn't see that coming.
