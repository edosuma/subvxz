07:08.083 --> 07:10.667
YOU'RE BEING CLEAR WITH SARAH
THAT IT'S TOO EARLY FOR SEX.

07:10.709 --> 07:13.041
OH, DR. FREEDMAN,
SHE'S ALREADY HAVING IT.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.208

ANOTHER EIGHTH GRADER.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.625
THEY BOTH HAVE
HORMONES RAGING,

07:17.667 --> 07:20.041

BUT YOU'RE CONDONING THIS.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.709
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN
WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.709
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP AS MUCH
OF IT AS I CAN ON MY TERMS.

07:28.750 --> 07:32.041
THE KIDS ARE ONLY ALLOWED
TO HAVE SEX IN MY HOUSE

07:32.083 --> 07:34.083
WHEN I'M THERE.
UH, WAIT.
I'M--I'M SORRY. WHAT?

07:34.125 --> 07:36.250
WOULD IT BE BETTER IF I
FORCE THEM TO SNEAK AROUND,

07:36.291 --> 07:39.083
SCRAMBLING FOR PRIVACY GOD KNOWS
WHERE WITH NO SUPERVISION?

07:39.125 --> 07:42.458
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
IF YOU JUST TOLD THEM NO?
AND ENFORCE IT HOW?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.333
IT'S JUST ME,
AND I WORK 50 HOURS A WEEK.

07:45.375 --> 07:49.083
I CAN ONLY TRY TO STEER HER
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

07:49.125 --> 07:50.792
HELP HER AVOID GETTING HURT.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.500
SHE'S 12 YEARS OLD AND SHE'S
HAVING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

07:53.542 --> 07:56.333
SHE'S ALREADY BEING HURT.
ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU ARE OUT OF LINE.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.041
MOM.
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:59.083 --> 08:01.709
WE'RE LEAVING. THANK YOU.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.333
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HER?

08:08.625 --> 08:10.291
(sighs)

08:10.333 --> 08:13.041
(Duncan) SO YOU BELIEVE
DR. ALLEN'S DIAGNOSIS

08:13.083 --> 08:15.917
AND TREATMENT WERE APPROPRIATE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

08:15.959 --> 08:17.917
MORE THAN APPROPRIATE.
EXTRAORDINARY.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.083
UH, MARTIN WEISER
CAME INTO THE E.R.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.041
WITH CRUSHING CHEST PAINS,
HYPOXIC,

08:23.083 --> 08:25.041
BARELY RESPONSIVE.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.041
WHEN THE PATIENT PROGRESSED
TO FULL CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST,

08:27.083 --> 08:30.625
DR. ALLEN DID C.P.R.
AND DEFIBRILLATION,

08:30.667 --> 08:34.208
EXACTLY AS INDICATED, UH,
EXACTLY AS ANY DOCTOR WOULD DO.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.083
SO IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION,
DR. BENNETT,

08:36.125 --> 08:39.041
WERE THERE MISTAKES MADE HERE?
EVEN WHEN
WE DO EVERYTHING RIGHT,

08:39.083 --> 08:41.041
AND I BELIEVE DR. ALLEN DID,

08:41.083 --> 08:44.125
THERE ARE SOME PATIENTS
WE JUST CAN'T SAVE.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.041
NOW THAT'S NOT MALPRACTICE.
THAT'S... THAT'S JUST LIFE.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.083
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.959
(coughs)

08:56.000 --> 08:59.125
I'M SORRY. UH, DR. BENNETT,
I AM CORINNE LEE.

08:59.166 --> 09:02.667

WIDOW AND HIS SON.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.542

"A GOOD DOCTOR

"TO EVALUATE THEM INDIVIDUALLY,
NOT BY THE BOOK.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.041

A QUESTION SOMEWHERE HERE?

09:15.041 --> 09:17.834

BUT DOESN'T IT CONTRADICT

09:20.875 --> 09:24.083
WHAT YOU WERE JUST SAYING
ABOUT MR. WEISER'S CARE?

09:24.125 --> 09:27.250
YOU QUOTED TEXTBOOK CASES
AND STANDARD PROTOCOLS.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.041
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.792
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE HIM.
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

09:31.834 --> 09:34.250
WELL, I STAND BEHIND
EVERYTHING I SAID

09:34.291 --> 09:37.417
ABOUT DR. ALLEN'S CARE.
SO YOU DIDN'T MEAN
WHAT YOU WROTE?

09:37.458 --> 09:40.375
I DID. UH, I-I SPENT A LOT OF
TIME RESEARCHING AND WRITING--

09:40.417 --> 09:43.208
DOES THAT LEAVE YOU MUCH TIME
FOR SEEING ACTUAL PATIENTS?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.041
WELL, WELL, I HAVE
A VERY ACTIVE MEDICAL PRACTICE.

09:46.083 --> 09:50.041
YES, UM,
OCEANSIDE WELLNESS GROUP.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.041
THERE WAS
A MEASLES OUTBREAK THERE.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.709
DID YOU FOLLOW THE BOOK
ON THAT ONE?
OBJECTION. ARGUMENTATIVE.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.625
DR. BENNETT IS HOLDING HIMSELF
UP AS AN EXPERT.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.417
I'M ENTITLED TO QUESTION HIM
ON THAT CLAIM.
OVERRULED.

10:01.458 --> 10:06.041
SO, UH, THE MEASLES OUTBREAK.
A CHILD DIED.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.959
AGAIN, ARGUMENTATIVE.
WITHDRAWN.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.959
WAS THE NOTED CYCLIST
RAY DANIELS

10:10.000 --> 10:11.417
A PATIENT UNDER YOUR CARE?

10:11.458 --> 10:13.834
YES, HE WAS.
HE HAD A SERIOUS
HEART MUSCLE DISORDER,

10:13.875 --> 10:17.041
BUT YOU LET HIM COMPETE
IN A 100-MILE BIKE RACE,

10:17.083 --> 10:19.542
AND HE DIED AS WELL,
DIDN'T HE?
I TOLD HIM NOT TO RACE.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.709
BUT YOU TREATED HIM
FOR A SPORTS INJURY

10:21.750 --> 10:24.500
SO THAT HE COULD RACE.
SEE, RAY--RAY WAS PIGHEADED.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.750
PIGHEADED? DO YOU ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS LIKE THAT?
NO, NO.

10:27.792 --> 10:30.667
OR ONLY THE DEAD ONES?
WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE--

10:30.709 --> 10:33.041
THIS FAMILY LOST A HUSBAND,
A FATHER.

10:33.083 --> 10:36.041
HE WALKED IN THE DOOR
AND DID NOT GET THE TREATMENT

10:36.083 --> 10:37.583
THAT HE NEEDED.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.917
NOW IT MAY BE OKAY WITH YOU
THAT PATIENTS JUST DIE.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.083
IT'S NOT OKAY WITH THEM.

10:43.125 --> 10:47.083
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR NICKNAME...

10:47.125 --> 10:49.250
"DR. FEELGOOD."

10:58.333 --> 11:01.041
I JUST SPENT TIME WITH
A HAPPY, HEALTHY GIRL

11:01.083 --> 11:02.959
THAT SHE HAS RAISED.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.333
YVONNE IS OBVIOUSLY
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
SHE'S DOING
A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.959
I DON'T THINK THAT EXCUSES

11:07.000 --> 11:09.291
LETTING HER DAUGHTER HAVE SEX
IN THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.000
VIOLET, COULD YOU
BACK ME UP HERE?
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.375
I MEAN, ADOLESCENT SEXUALITY

11:13.417 --> 11:16.625
IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN JUST SAY NO TO.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.041
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE NUANCES
OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION.
YEAH, SO A MOTHER

11:19.083 --> 11:21.041
WHO ACKNOWLEDGES
HER DAUGHTER'S DESIRES

11:21.083 --> 11:23.083
AND TRIES TO
CHANNEL THEM SAFELY IS...
PROBABLY DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

11:23.125 --> 11:26.041
YEAH. HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHOA, WHOA.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.417
HOPSCOTCHERS.
YEAH.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.417
HELLO, HOPSCOTCHERS.
VIOLET.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.875
UH-HUH.
THE MOTHER IS ALLOWING
HER 12-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

11:31.917 --> 11:34.875
TO HAVE SEX IN HER HOUSE.
COOPER, IF YOU'RE NOT THERE,
IT'S--IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW

11:34.917 --> 11:37.959
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HER
AND HER DAUGHTER.
(Dell) RIGHT, 'CAUSE WHY
WOULD A MAN GET A SAY?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.208
UGH!
I MEAN, THE MOTHER KNOWS BEST.
THAT'S HOW THE WORLD WORKS.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.667
SEE? OKAY,
LIKE WITH DELL, RIGHT?

11:42.709 --> 11:45.333
MOTHER DOES NOT
ALWAYS KNOW BEST.
YEAH, BUT IT'S APPLES
AND ORANGES.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.333
NO, IT IS NOT.
AND HOW CAN YOU,

11:47.375 --> 11:50.333
AS THE MOTHER OF A LITTLE GIRL,
HOW--HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE

11:50.375 --> 11:52.959
A PROBLEM WITH WHAT YVONNE
IS DOING HERE?
WELL, WITH MAYA, THIS--

11:53.000 --> 11:55.542
I MEAN, ZERO CHANCE OF HAPPENING
'CAUSE I WOULD KILL HER.

11:55.583 --> 11:58.041
BUT I-I AM TALKING ABOUT
YVONNE'S RIGHT AS A PARENT

11:58.083 --> 12:01.041
TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST
FOR HER CHILD.
FINE, BUT MOTHERHOOD
IS NOT A TRUMP CARD.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.333
WRONG IS WRONG.
PARENTS GET TO
DECIDE THAT, COOPER.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.375
YES.
NOT DOCTORS.

12:05.417 --> 12:08.041
I-I JUST HOPE
THAT WHEN BETSEY'S 12,

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
THERE'S SOMEONE
LIKE COOPER THERE TO SAY

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
THAT IT'S NOT OKAY TO BE
SLEEPING AROUND,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.417
NO MATTER
WHAT THE MOTHER THINKS.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.917
(babies crying)

12:20.959 --> 12:22.917
HEY, I GOT BRODY
FROM ANESTHESIA

12:22.959 --> 12:25.041
TO COME IN FOR MORGAN.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.000
I BOOKED THE O.R.
FOR 4:00.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.375
OKAY, WELL, UM,
WHAT ABOUT THE 26 WEEKS?

12:29.417 --> 12:31.000
IS THAT OKAY?

12:31.041 --> 12:33.792
UH, IT'S LATE.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.834
BUT IT'S THE BEST CHOICE.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.417
SHE LOVES YOU, YOU KNOW?

12:40.458 --> 12:42.041
I KNOW.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.083
SHE NEEDS YOU.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.125
I KNOW.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.208
(Ben) STOP IT.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.250
(Pete) YOU TAKE CARE
OF THIS CHARACTER.
(woman) OKAY.

12:51.291 --> 12:55.041
THANKS FOR COMING IN.
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, REALLY.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.041
SEE YOU TOMORROW, OKAY?
TAKE CARE.
OKAY. BYE.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.041
(elevator doors close)
HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK

12:59.083 --> 13:01.458
ABOUT SLEEPING
WITH A PATIENT'S MOTHER?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.875
WHAT?

13:02.917 --> 13:06.750
THAT FLIRTY SMILE,
LEADING TO UNNECESSARY BUT...

13:06.792 --> 13:08.750
COME ON.
GENTLE PHYSICAL CONTACT.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.125
YOU KNOW WHAT, VIOLET?

13:10.166 --> 13:12.333
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMMENT
ON MY LOVE LIFE. YOU DON'T.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.750
IT'S AN ETHICAL ISSUE.
WHAT? I'M TREATING HER SON,
NOT HER.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.750
YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
A YOUNG, VULNERABLE MOTHER

13:16.792 --> 13:18.917
WHO CAN'T HELP BUT RESPOND...
OH, PLEASE.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.917
TO SOMEONE IN A POSITION
OF AUTHORITY.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.041
YOU THINK
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

13:23.083 --> 13:26.166
SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN ME?

13:29.083 --> 13:32.041
(knocks on window)
ETHICALLY SPEAKING--

13:32.083 --> 13:34.083
WRONG PERSON
TO TALK TO RIGHT NOW.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.083
PROBLEM?

13:37.709 --> 13:40.041
NEVER MIND.
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

13:40.083 --> 13:43.125
DATING A PATIENT'S MOTHER--
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, RIGHT?

13:43.166 --> 13:45.125
VIOLET THINKS
IT'S A PROBLEM.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.583
I DON'T KNOW, PETE.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.583
OH, GOD.

13:51.083 --> 13:54.291
I'M ABOUT TO OPERATE
ON NOAH'S WIFE.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.083
AND I LIKE HER.
I REALLY LIKE HER.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.125
AND THEIR MARRIAGE
IS ON THE ROCKS,

13:59.166 --> 14:02.709
AND THE ONLY THING HOLDING IT
TOGETHER IS THIS BABY,

14:02.750 --> 14:06.125
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO SAVE IT.
WELL, YOU'LL SAVE THE BABY.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

14:06.166 --> 14:09.500
OF COURSE I'M GONNA SAVE
THE BABY. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.
(snaps fingers)

14:09.542 --> 14:11.500
IT'S... I DON'T KNOW.
(clears throat)

14:11.542 --> 14:15.542
ADDISON, THEIR MARRIAGE, UH,
IT'S--IT'S NOT IN YOUR HANDS.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.333
WHAT IF IT IS?
THEN IT'S ALREADY GONE SOUTH.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.583
I'M NOT A CHEATER, PETE.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.542
I'M NOT. I MEAN...

14:25.583 --> 14:28.041
MAYBE THAT ONE TIME I DID,
BUT NOT NOW.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.875
I'M--IT'S NOT WHO I AM.
I AM NOT A CHEATER.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.667
I KNOW.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.959
THEN WHY
DO I FEEL LIKE I AM?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
(elevator bell dings)

14:41.083 --> 14:43.041
SAM...

14:43.083 --> 14:45.166
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:45.208 --> 14:47.166
HE JUST LOST IT
ON THE STAND, NAI.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.166
THE OTHER SIDE CAME AFTER HIM--
THE PRACTICE, HIS CREDIBILITY--

14:50.208 --> 14:54.041
AND HE JUST... HE JUST
LET HER SHRED HIM UP THERE.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.583
IT WAS THAT BAD?

14:55.625 --> 14:58.583
I KNOW THAT I WAS THE ONE THAT
TALKED HIM INTO DOING THIS,

14:58.625 --> 15:01.667
BUT I JUST... THOUGHT...
HE'S SAM.

15:01.709 --> 15:04.041
ALL THAT EXPERIENCE
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA...

15:04.083 --> 15:06.917
HE'S A DOCTOR.
HE'S NOT A SPOKESPERSON.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.166
IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE
OF TURNING THIS AROUND,

15:09.208 --> 15:12.041
I NEED TO PUT SAM
BACK UP THERE ON THAT STAND.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.166
BUT ONLY IF HE CAN DO IT.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.834
(gasps)
(monitor beeping rapidly)

15:16.875 --> 15:19.041
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHORTNESS OF BREATH
WITH PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.792
SATs ARE DROPPING,
D-DIMER'S POSITIVE.

15:20.834 --> 15:23.041
PROBABLY THREW A P.E.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.041
(gasping) IS THE...
THE BABY OKAY?

15:26.083 --> 15:29.250
THERE'S NO SIGNS
OF FETAL DISTRESS, MORGAN.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.667
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:31.709 --> 15:34.041
V-FIB. SHE'S CODING.
GET THE CRASH CART, STAT!

15:34.083 --> 15:36.208
(woman) LET'S GO.
GET THE CART OVER HERE.
GIVE ME THE BAG.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.208
GIVE ME THAT.
GIVE ME THE BAG.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.250
GET READY TO CHARGE.
I'LL DO IT.
I'M--I'M GONNA DO IT.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.834
NOAH--
NO, LOOK. SHE'S MY WIFE.
I'LL DO IT.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.041
CHARGE TO 200.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.834
(defibrillator whines)

15:47.875 --> 15:51.041
OKAY. CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

15:51.083 --> 15:53.250
CHARGE TO 300.
(defibrillator whines)

15:53.291 --> 15:55.041
ALL RIGHT. CLEAR.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.250
(paddles thunk)

15:57.291 --> 16:00.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
I GOT A PULSE.
OKAY, PRESSURE'S COMING UP.

16:00.375 --> 16:03.959
BABY'S HEARTBEAT IS NORMAL.
START HER ON LIDOCAINE.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.959
CALL I.C.U. AND TELL 'EM
WE NEED A ROOM, NOW.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.333
UM, BOLUS 75 MILLIGRAMS,

16:07.375 --> 16:09.250
THEN START A 2-MILLIGRAMS-
PER-MINUTE DRIP.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.250
NOAH. NOAH.
SHE ALMOST DIED.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.125
BUT SHE DIDN'T.
SHE DIDN'T.

16:13.166 --> 16:16.125
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD'VE
KNOWN ABOUT THE P.E.
I'M A HEART SURGEON.
I SHOULD'VE.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.875
THERE'S NO WAY--
I MEAN, I LIVE WITH HER.
I WASN'T PAYING ANY ATTENTION.

16:18.917 --> 16:21.375
THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.
NOAH, THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT.
I WASN'T PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO HER.

16:21.417 --> 16:24.125
IT IS. IT IS MY FAULT.
I DON'T SEE HER ANYMORE.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.125
I DON'T LOOK AT HER...
BUT--

16:26.166 --> 16:28.125
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER,
NOT LIKE I SHOULD.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.458
I MEAN, I CARE ABOUT THE BABY,
BUT I DON'T--
YES, BUT--

16:30.500 --> 16:34.625
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER.
I DON'T SEE HER ANYMORE.
BUT YOU JUST
SAVED HER LIFE, NOAH.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.041
WOULD YOU STOP TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?!

16:37.083 --> 16:40.083
I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER.
ALL I THINK ABOUT IS YOU.

16:40.125 --> 16:44.125
ALL I THINK ABOUT IS YOU,
AND SHE COULD'VE DIED.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.333
SHE COULD'VE DIED.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.000
FEELING BETTER?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.834
I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT
IN THERE, NAI.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.208
I'M A GOOD DOCTOR.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.041
I'M A GREAT DOCTOR.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.041
YES, YOU ARE A GREAT DOCTOR.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.041
YOU ARE NOT
A PROFESSIONAL WITNESS.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.792
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.792
SAM, I HAVE SEEN YOU

17:19.834 --> 17:22.542
CONVINCE AN ENTIRE AUDITORIUM
OF PEOPLE

17:22.583 --> 17:24.750
TO DO WHAT YOU WROTE
IN YOUR BOOK.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.125
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU CAN
CONVINCE 12 PEOPLE

17:27.166 --> 17:30.000
THAT YOU'RE NOT
A BLITHERING IDIOT.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.750
HE WANTS TO PUT YOU
BACK ON THE STAND.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.750
(scoffs) REALLY?

17:34.792 --> 17:36.166
YEAH.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.375
THAT MEANS I GOTTA GO
BACK OVER

17:41.417 --> 17:43.792
ALL THE MEDICINE FROM THAT CASE
AND MEMORIZE IT.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.583
THAT WAY,
NO MATTER WHAT I'M ASKED,

17:46.625 --> 17:50.041
I'LL BE ABLE TO BRING IT BACK
TO WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT MATTERS.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.041
I WILL NOT BE THROWN.

17:52.083 --> 17:56.208
(ringtone playing)

17:59.875 --> 18:01.834
(ringtone stops)

18:05.083 --> 18:07.208
(sighs)
(Violet) I CAN'T HELP IT.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.208
ALL I WANT TO DO IS EAT
AND SLEEP AND BARK.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.834
I BARKED AT PETE THIS MORNING.
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE DESERVED IT.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.125
HE WANTS TO DATE
A PATIENT'S MOTHER. WHAT?

18:15.166 --> 18:16.750
A MESSAGE FROM SOME KID

18:16.792 --> 18:19.208
ABOUT THE NAKED PICTURES
OF MY 12-YEAR-OLD PATIENT

18:19.250 --> 18:21.208
THAT ARE NOW
APPARENTLY FLOATING AROUND.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.500
YOU STILL THINK
MOTHER KNOWS BEST?
(dial tone drones)

18:23.542 --> 18:26.417
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
I'M CALLING D.C.F.S.

18:26.458 --> 18:30.542
ABOUT SARAH? NO, COOPER.
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PROTECT
THIS GIRL.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.542
YOU CANNOT CALL FAMILY SERVICES.
I JUST GOT HER BLOOD WORK BACK.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.917
SARAH'S PREGNANT.

18:35.959 --> 18:38.250
(slams down receiver)

18:38.291 --> 18:40.041
(Addison) HEY.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.041
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
DROPPED ME AS A PATIENT.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.041
I SEEM TO BE TROUBLE.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.041
YOU'RE DOING FINE NOW.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.500
(exhales deeply)

18:49.542 --> 18:51.041
NOAH TOLD ME.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.875

SO, UH, I WAS GOING
BACK OVER THE RECORDS,

20:27.709 --> 20:30.625
UH, TRYING TO ANTICIPATE
EVERY QUESTION

20:30.667 --> 20:33.041
THAT THEY MIGHT ASK ME,

20:33.083 --> 20:35.583
AND, UH, WELL,
TWO YEARS AGO,

20:35.625 --> 20:38.250
YOUR PATIENT HAD
A HERNIA PATCHED UP.

20:38.291 --> 20:41.000
IT WAS JUST A QUICK,
20-MINUTE PROCEDURE.

20:41.041 --> 20:44.000
THEY GAVE HIM MORPHINE
FOR--FOR THE PAIN.
HE WASN'T MY PATIENT
TWO YEARS AGO.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.041
I KNOW,
BUT MORPHINE WAS OVERKILL.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.041
THEY WOULD'VE JUST GIVEN HIM

20:48.083 --> 20:50.375
A NON-STEROIDAL
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY

20:50.417 --> 20:52.041
UNLESS...

20:52.083 --> 20:56.041
HE WAS ALLERGIC
TO ASPIRIN.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.041
NOW THE ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY
WOULD'VE--

20:58.083 --> 21:01.125

UH, ON THE CHART.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.959

21:16.083 --> 21:19.417

WHY YOU COULDN'T REVIVE HIM.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.458

AND HE WAS...

21:22.500 --> 21:24.458

JUST A HEART ATTACK.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.041

A BARELY RESPONSIVE PATIENT

21:27.083 --> 21:29.041

21:40.083 --> 21:42.333
PROBABLY NOT, BUT Y-YOU
COULD'VE TESTIFIED TO THAT.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.333

WOULD'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY

EVERY THOUSAND PATIENTS?

21:53.083 --> 21:56.291

AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS AT YOUR AGE.
(Yvonne) OKAY, WE'VE HEARD
YOUR POINT OF VIEW,

29:58.333 --> 30:01.125
AND OF COURSE SHE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.083
SHE'S HAVING AN ABORTION.
OKAY, THIS IS WHERE
YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN?

30:04.125 --> 30:07.250
SHE'S 12 YEARS OLD.
AND WHERE DID YOU THINK
IT WAS LEADING?

30:07.291 --> 30:08.875
COOPER.
EXCUSE ME.

30:08.917 --> 30:11.000
THANK YOU.

30:13.083 --> 30:16.041
(voice breaks)
I WANT TO KEEP THE BABY.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.291
(knock on door)

30:29.333 --> 30:31.291
HEY, VIOLET, I ASKED LISA OUT.
BEN'S MOM.

30:31.333 --> 30:34.041
UM, IT'S NOT WRONG,
I'M DOING IT OPENLY,

30:34.083 --> 30:37.583
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
ABOUT IT, SO I'M TELLING YOU.
I UNDERSTAND.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.583
I'M TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE,

30:39.625 --> 30:41.583
WHATEVER THAT IS,
AND, UH...

30:41.625 --> 30:43.834
BUT I ALSO
NEED TO HAVE A LIFE.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.041
YOU SHOULD.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.000
THANKS.

30:53.542 --> 30:56.041
(sighs)

30:56.083 --> 30:59.125
YOU NEED TO BACK OFF
IN THERE.
OKAY, HOW...

30:59.166 --> 31:01.208
(lowered voice)
HOW ARE WE S--

31:01.250 --> 31:04.000
FORGET IT.

31:05.375 --> 31:08.375
GOOD MORNING.
YEAH, I WENT OUT
PRETTY HARD LAST NIGHT.

31:08.417 --> 31:11.750
I FELT LIKE CRAP THIS MORNING,
SO...
WHAT, WHAT, SO YOU JUST
DECIDED TO SLEEP IN?

31:11.792 --> 31:14.750
MM. NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS
UP EARLY, BUT I HAD BED SPINS.

31:14.792 --> 31:17.041
THEN I SAW IT WAS
3 TO 5 AND GLASSY.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.041
FIGURED I'D GET AN HOUR IN
THE WATER BEFORE I HEADED HERE.
DELL, THIS IS NOT YOU.

31:20.083 --> 31:23.125
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS ME,
AND MAYBE SINCE I'M ONLY 24,

31:23.166 --> 31:26.875
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT
AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT YOU
CAN'T HAVE ANY FUN.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.875
BUT YOU HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES HERE, DELL--
I'M SICK OF TRYING
TO WORK SO HARD

31:29.917 --> 31:31.875
TO DO THE RIGHT THING
ALL THE TIME.

31:31.917 --> 31:35.041
WORK FULL-TIME, GET LICENSED,
ACT LIKE AN ADULT--WHO CARES?

31:35.083 --> 31:36.667
WHO CARES?

31:36.709 --> 31:38.667
OKAY, YOUR SATs LOOK GOOD.

31:38.709 --> 31:42.041
I'LL HAVE THE NURSE COME
AND PREP YOU FOR THE CERCLAGE,

31:42.083 --> 31:44.625
AND I WILL MEET YOU
IN THE O.R.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.041
HAVE YOU SEE NOAH?

31:46.083 --> 31:47.625
HE'S NOT HERE YET?

31:47.667 --> 31:50.166
HE HASN'T COME
OR ANSWERED THE PHONE.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.417
WELL, I'LL, UM, I'LL PAGE HIM.
MAYBE HE'S IN SURGERY.

31:53.458 --> 31:56.583
I ALREADY TRIED. HE'S NOT.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.583
I CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT HIM.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.083
MORGAN... WE CAN'T WAIT ON THIS.
WE--WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW.

32:02.125 --> 32:04.083
THEN FIND HIM FOR ME.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.375
PLEASE.

32:05.417 --> 32:07.709
JUST FIND HIM.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.834
(sniffles)

32:13.959 --> 32:16.959
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
I HAD TO RUN UP HERE

32:17.000 --> 32:18.417
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DAY?

32:18.458 --> 32:20.917
I WANT TO THROTTLE SOMEONE.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

32:20.959 --> 32:22.917
I'M S--I'M SERIOUS.
I'M SERIOUS. I JUST HAD TO--

32:22.959 --> 32:25.750
I HAD TO WALK OUT OF A CONSULT
SO I DIDN'T EXPLODE

32:25.792 --> 32:27.750
AT THE MOTHER
OF MY 12-YEAR-OLD PATIENT--

32:27.792 --> 32:29.500
MY PREGNANT
12-YEAR-OLD PATIENT--

32:29.542 --> 32:31.500
WHOSE MOTHER HAS DECIDED
ALL OF A SUDDEN

32:31.542 --> 32:33.083
SHE'S INTERESTED
IN PARENTING AGAIN.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.041
OH, I SHOULD'VE CALLED
D.C.F.S.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.041
COOP, ISN'T THIS
WHAT YOU WANTED,

32:37.083 --> 32:39.709
FOR HER TO STEP UP
AND PARENT?

32:39.750 --> 32:42.542
PARENT? YES. SHE IS DICTATING
AN ABORTION TO A 12 YEAR OLD.

32:42.583 --> 32:45.041
IS SHE WRONG?

32:45.083 --> 32:46.458
(sighs)

32:48.500 --> 32:50.041
PROBABLY NOT.

32:50.083 --> 32:52.875
I SEE WHAT IT IS DOING
TO THAT GIRL

32:52.917 --> 32:55.250
AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE
DOING TO HER...

32:55.291 --> 32:59.166
AND I FIND THAT HARD...
TO FORGIVE.

32:59.208 --> 33:03.000
YOU FORGAVE ME... FOR WORSE.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.041
(elevator bell dings)

33:06.083 --> 33:08.375
(Lisa) DR. WILDER.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.959
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW. HE CALLED ME
FROM A FRIEND'S HOUSE,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.125
SAID HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE
SWALLOWING, AND THEN IN THE CAR,

33:14.166 --> 33:16.583
HE SAID HE WAS--
HE WAS FEELING DIZZY.

33:16.625 --> 33:19.583
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY. WE'LL
TAKE CARE OF HIM RIGHT HERE.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.417
HE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
WITH FOOD.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.375
IT'S ONLY BEEN ENVIRONMENTAL.
PROBLEMS CAN START
AT ANY AGE,

33:24.417 --> 33:26.375
AND BEN'S
A HIGHLY ALLERGIC KID.
(gasping)

33:26.417 --> 33:28.000
BEN?
SOMETHING'S... WRONG.

33:28.041 --> 33:30.625
OKAY, BEN, YOU'RE HAVING
AN ACUTE ALLERGIC ATTACK,

33:30.667 --> 33:33.500
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. I'LL
TAKE CARE OF YOU, ALL RIGHT?

33:33.542 --> 33:36.625
I JUST HAVE TO GRAB
A COUPLE OF THINGS.
BUDDY, LISTEN TO ME.
HE'S GONNA GET SOME MEDICINE.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.500
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER
IN JUST A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

33:39.542 --> 33:41.917
I'M RIGHT HERE. I'M RIGHT HERE.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

33:41.959 --> 33:45.041
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER
IN JUST A COUPLE MORE SECONDS.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME ADRENALINE.

33:45.083 --> 33:47.709
VERY SOON, BEN.
IT'S GONNA OPEN UP
YOUR AIRWAY.

33:47.750 --> 33:51.041
(Ben groaning)

33:51.083 --> 33:54.041
(Lisa whispers)
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

33:54.083 --> 33:57.000
(groaning continues)

34:03.083 --> 34:06.125
IS YOUR THROAT OPENING?
YOU GETTING SOME AIR?

34:06.166 --> 34:07.959
(exhales deeply)

34:08.000 --> 34:11.125
(sniffles and sobs)

34:11.166 --> 34:13.041
(laughs)
IT'S WORKING.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.041
THANK YOU.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.750
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

34:16.792 --> 34:20.542
(sniffles) THANK YOU.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.542
(Duncan) SO BASED ON
YOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,

34:22.583 --> 34:25.083
THE DOZENS OF CARDIAC PATIENTS

34:25.125 --> 34:27.041
THAT YOU HAVE
PERSONALLY ATTENDED TO,

34:27.083 --> 34:29.875
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION,
DR. BENNETT,

34:29.917 --> 34:32.875
DID DR. ALLEN DO EVERYTHING
THAT HE REASONABLY COULD DO

34:32.917 --> 34:34.625
TO SAVE THE PATIENT?

34:37.083 --> 34:39.000
YES, HE DID.

34:39.041 --> 34:42.208
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU
WOULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY?

34:45.125 --> 34:47.667
DR. BENNETT?

34:50.041 --> 34:53.917
UH, GIVEN WHAT DR. ALLEN
KNEW AT THE TIME,

34:53.959 --> 34:56.917
NO.

34:56.959 --> 34:59.917
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

34:59.959 --> 35:01.917
RECROSS.

35:06.542 --> 35:09.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "GIVEN WHAT
DR. ALLEN KNEW AT THE TIME"?

35:09.709 --> 35:11.458
OBJECTION.
CALLS FOR SPECULATION.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.959
OVERRULED. YOU MAY ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.458
UH, DR. ALLEN WAS WORKING
SO FAST,

35:22.500 --> 35:26.083
AND HE WAS UNDER
SO MUCH PRESSURE...

35:26.125 --> 35:28.083
THAT HE DIDN'T STOP TO LOOK

35:28.125 --> 35:31.083
AT THE PATIENT'S
FULL MEDICAL HISTORY.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.875
SO HE WAS NOT AWARE
THAT MARTIN WEISER HAD

35:34.917 --> 35:37.917
AN ASPIRIN ALLERGY.

35:42.542 --> 35:45.250
THAT'S NOT
IN ANY OF OUR DISCOVERY.

35:45.291 --> 35:48.083
THAT'S BECAUSE, UH, DR. ALLEN
SWAPPED OUT ONE OF THE PAGES,

35:48.125 --> 35:50.375
UH, FROM THE FILE.

35:50.417 --> 35:52.333
HE LIED?

35:54.041 --> 35:56.041
YES.

35:56.083 --> 35:59.000
(gallery murmuring)

36:03.041 --> 36:05.041
(gavel bangs)

36:07.208 --> 36:09.583
YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO ME
AND TOLD ME WHAT YOU FOUND.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.750
THAT WOULD'VE PUT YOU
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.
AND YOU THOUGHT
THIS WOULD BE BETTER?

36:11.792 --> 36:14.375
YOU WANTED ME HERE
AS AN EXPERT, A DOCTOR.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.000
THAT MEANS I'M ASKING PEOPLE

36:16.041 --> 36:18.000
TO TRUST ME WITH THEIR LIVES
EVERY DAY.

36:18.041 --> 36:20.542
NOW PART OF THAT TRUST
MEANS TELLING THE TRUTH.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.375
EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD,
I HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH.

36:23.417 --> 36:25.417
YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO ME.

36:30.375 --> 36:33.125
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

36:33.166 --> 36:37.125
I CAN'T LOOK AT HER.
SHE'LL SEE IT IN MY EYES.

36:37.166 --> 36:39.333
IT'S TIME FOR HER SURGERY,
NOAH.

36:39.375 --> 36:41.333
LOOK, I'M CHEATING ON HER.
NO--

36:41.375 --> 36:44.041
IN MY SOUL, I AM--
I'M CHEATING ON HER.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.875
SHE DESERVES MORE.
WHAT KIND OF MAN--
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.

36:46.917 --> 36:49.750
YOUR WIFE IS ABOUT TO HAVE
A PROCEDURE

36:49.792 --> 36:52.041
THAT SCARES
THE HELL OUT OF HER.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.542
SHE'S UPSTAIRS, SHE'S ALONE
AND SHE NEEDS YOU.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.375
WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU?
YOU'RE THE KIND OF MAN WHO PUTS

36:55.417 --> 36:58.375
HIS OWN FEELINGS ASIDE,
AS HARD AS THAT MIGHT BE,

36:58.417 --> 37:01.125
AND GOES IN THAT O.R.
AND HOLDS HIS WIFE'S HAND.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.291
THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN
YOU ARE.

37:05.083 --> 37:09.000
(speaking indistinctly)

37:21.709 --> 37:23.875
WELL, I SCREWED UP.

37:23.917 --> 37:26.041
I HAD MY CHANCE
TO BE A PARENT,

37:26.083 --> 37:28.041
AND I SCREWED UP.

37:28.083 --> 37:31.375
NOW SHE DOESN'T CARE
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.000
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE TOLD ME?

37:34.041 --> 37:37.834
THAT SHE'S THE BABY'S MOTHER,
SO SHE GETS TO DECIDE.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.834
SHE'S RIGHT. YOU CAN'T
FORCE HER TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.583
BUT YOU'RE STILL HER MOTHER.

37:42.625 --> 37:44.667
AND IF SHE'S GONNA BE
A PARENT,

37:44.709 --> 37:47.250
SHE'S GONNA NEED YOU
EVEN MORE.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.250
SARAH IS STILL A CHILD,

37:49.291 --> 37:51.834
AND SHE AS A LOT TO LEARN
FROM YOU.

37:51.875 --> 37:54.417
YOU THINK
SHE'LL LISTEN TO ME?

37:54.458 --> 37:57.458
I THINK
YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.709
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

38:02.750 --> 38:06.083
(inhales and exhales deeply)

38:06.125 --> 38:08.750
(door opens)

38:11.083 --> 38:13.417
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE COMING.
I'M HERE.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.458
TELL ME
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.041
IT IS.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.792
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

38:31.333 --> 38:32.500
HEY.

38:32.542 --> 38:33.709
HEY.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.333
HOW'D THE TESTIMONY GO?

38:35.375 --> 38:38.041
OH, UH, IT WAS COMPLICATED.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.333
OH, COMPLICATED GOOD,
OR COMPLICATED BAD?

38:40.375 --> 38:41.959
UH... (blows air)

38:42.000 --> 38:44.333
YOU WANT TO COME DOWN
BY THE WATER WITH ME,

38:44.375 --> 38:46.333
HAVE A DRINK,
I'LL TELL YOU?

38:46.375 --> 38:49.333
OH, UM, YOU KNOW, I, UM,
I, UH, I HAVE PLANS, SO--

38:49.375 --> 38:52.000
OH, OKAY.

38:52.041 --> 38:54.041
I'M GOING OUT WITH DUNCAN.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.250
REALLY? OH. OKAY.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.375
SO TOMORROW?

38:58.417 --> 39:00.667
SURE. SURE.

39:00.709 --> 39:01.834
OKAY.

39:01.875 --> 39:02.834
BYE.

39:05.083 --> 39:07.041
(Naomi) HI.
(Duncan) HEY.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.041
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.041

YES, YOU DO.

HEY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.375
SPARE ME THE SERMON, OKAY?

39:24.417 --> 39:26.375
NAOMI'S ALREADY
PREACHED TO ME TWICE.

39:26.417 --> 39:29.000
THIS ISN'T A SERMON,
AND I'M NOT PREACHING.

39:29.041 --> 39:31.041
I'M TELLING YOU
