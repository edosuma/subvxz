WEBVTT

00:08.220 --> 00:11.810
We were in a store and a guy in that store...

00:11.890 --> 00:14.520
...told us to put our uniforms on.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.680
"What the hell are you talking about?"

00:17.860 --> 00:22.161
He says, "The USA is in a war with Japan."

00:22.670 --> 00:24.060
We couldn't believe it.

00:24.130 --> 00:26.190
Well, our country was attacked.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.500
It's different.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.440
It wasn't like Korea or Vietnam.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.000
We were attacked.

00:31.910 --> 00:34.710
And, you know, it was a feeling that...

00:35.280 --> 00:38.250
...maybe, we're just dumb country people but...

00:38.320 --> 00:41.480
...where I come from a lot of us volunteered.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.820
"Who would like to volunteer for the Tank Corps?

00:43.890 --> 00:46.450
"Who would like to volunteer for the Air Force?

00:46.520 --> 00:49.750
"Who would like to volunteer
for the Navy?" or whatever.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.220
And then, they said:

00:51.300 --> 00:53.690
"Who would like to volunteer for the Airborne?"

00:54.130 --> 00:56.360
Somebody says, "What the hell's the Airborne?"

00:56.430 --> 00:57.660
Nobody ever heard of it.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.030
We came from a small, small town.

01:00.170 --> 01:04.269
And three fellows in that town that were 4F...

01:04.340 --> 01:07.170
...committed suicide because they couldn't go.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.540
A different time.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.740
I did things.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.640
I didn't do them for medals.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.520
I didn't do them for accolades.
I did 'em because it's what had to be done.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.620
The guy says, "would you jump out of airplanes?

01:19.690 --> 01:21.350
"You know, you got all your army equipment...

01:21.430 --> 01:24.260
"...and you jump out of airplanes,
to fight the enemy."

01:24.600 --> 01:26.560
These guys, they said, "Go to hell."

01:26.630 --> 01:28.220
Nobody put up their hands.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.270
And then, I don't know what it was brought it up...

01:30.330 --> 01:33.230
...but the guy giving the speech was saying:

01:33.300 --> 01:35.930
"But you get paid $50 a month more."

01:36.010 --> 01:38.060
So, that made it a hundred bucks.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

04:36.820 --> 04:38.880
I want a whiff of chicken pie.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.110
Okay, boys, let's get this gear stowed.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.040
Fox Company... we go in five.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.160
"In the name of the Father..."

05:22.260 --> 05:24.200
1st Platoon, draw small arms.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.060
Do you need a hand, Lieutenant?

05:28.170 --> 05:31.600
Easy Company! Listen up!

05:31.670 --> 05:33.500
Gather up around me.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.010
Just move it up. Come on, gentlemen.

05:36.310 --> 05:37.570
Let's go!

05:41.320 --> 05:44.770
Now, the Channel coast
is socked in with rain and fog.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.440
High winds on the drop zone.

05:46.890 --> 05:48.980
No jump tonight.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.610
The invasion has been postponed.

05:51.690 --> 05:54.820
- We're on a 24-hour stand-down.
- Son of a bitch.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.620
Drill sergeants, take charge.

05:58.630 --> 06:01.960
Well, this is quite a surprise.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.330
Not particularly.

06:03.470 --> 06:05.700
It so happens I rather expected it.

06:06.210 --> 06:12.080
Well, I can't see how you people
can pass up $80,000 for the Cause

06:12.150 --> 06:13.630
For whose cause?

06:14.080 --> 06:16.280
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

06:16.350 --> 06:18.110
...why don't you join the Army?

06:41.210 --> 06:43.110
I think it's clearing up.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.680
You think it's clearing up?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.240
No.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.480
I think it's clearing up.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.180
How are your men?

06:58.360 --> 06:59.820
They'll be fine.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.360
5:00 in New York.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.520
4:00 in Chicago.

07:11.170 --> 07:13.570
Happy hour, huh? Yeah.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.230
Happy hour.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.040
A couple of drinks.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.640
Maybe an early dinner before the theater.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.140
A civilized place for civilized men.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.720
Should've been born earlier, Nix.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.420
What, and give up all this?

07:53.950 --> 07:56.410
We'll go to Chicago, I'll take you there.

07:57.150 --> 07:58.380
Yeah.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.520
We'll see.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.090
Actually, you know who's from there?

08:12.160 --> 08:14.530
Who? Oh, him.

08:15.670 --> 08:19.190
712 days of that son of a bitch and here we are.

08:45.670 --> 08:49.500
You people are at the position of attention.

08:57.240 --> 09:01.670
Private Perconte, have you been blousing
your trousers over your boots like a paratrooper?

09:01.750 --> 09:02.540
No, sir.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.780
Then explain the creases at the bottom.

09:05.180 --> 09:06.240
No excuse, sir.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.080
Volunteering for the Parachute Infantry is one thing...

09:09.160 --> 09:11.680
...but you've got a long way to prove you belong here.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.850
Your weekend pass is revoked.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.650
Name? Luz, George.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.690
Dirt in the rear side aperture.

09:19.770 --> 09:21.160
Pass revoked.

09:33.710 --> 09:36.240
When did you sew on these chevrons, Sergeant Lipton?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.080
Yesterday, sir.

09:38.150 --> 09:40.280
Long enough to notice this. Revoked.

09:40.690 --> 09:41.580
Sir.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.380
Name?

09:44.460 --> 09:45.850
Malarkey, Donald G.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.560
Malarkey's slang for bullshit, isn't it?

09:48.630 --> 09:49.490
Yes, sir.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.230
Rust on the butt plate hinge spring,
Private Bullshit.

09:54.370 --> 09:55.660
Revoked.

09:57.100 --> 09:57.900
Name?

09:57.970 --> 09:59.400
Liebgott, Joseph D., sir.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.230
Rusty bayonet, Liebgott.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.500
You want to kill Germans?

10:06.580 --> 10:07.340
Yes, sir.

10:07.410 --> 10:08.640
Not with this.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.310
I wouldn't take this rusty piece of shit to war.

10:14.390 --> 10:17.680
And I will not take you to war in your condition.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.190
Now, thanks to these men and their infractions...

10:20.260 --> 10:23.020
...every man in the company who had a weekend pass...

10:23.330 --> 10:24.690
...has lost it.

10:27.470 --> 10:30.590
Change into your PT gear, we're running Currahee.

10:33.610 --> 10:34.730
2nd Platoon, fall out.

10:34.810 --> 10:35.830
We have two minutes.

10:35.910 --> 10:36.960
Fall out!

10:42.280 --> 10:44.080
I ain't going up that hill.

10:45.380 --> 10:49.050
Perconte, what are you thinking of
blousing your pants?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.210
Shut up, okay?

10:50.290 --> 10:51.380
He gigged everyone.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.680
You should know better.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.190
Don't give him no excuses.

10:54.260 --> 10:55.450
Excuses?

10:55.530 --> 10:57.650
Why don't you come here, look at these trousers...

10:57.730 --> 10:59.560
...get down and tell me if there's a crease?

10:59.630 --> 11:01.360
Let's go on the road in PT formation.

11:01.470 --> 11:02.900
Let's move, move, move!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.800
Perconte, let's go, Perconte.

11:10.180 --> 11:13.370
Private White, why are you not in your PT gear?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.770
I asked you a question, Private.

11:36.970 --> 11:38.940
Oh, Easy Company.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.370
While you're running, don't worry.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.230
We'll take your dames to the movies.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.870
Yeah, good, they need some female company.

11:51.180 --> 11:52.340
Where do we run?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.580
Currahee.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.810
What does "Currahee" mean?

11:54.890 --> 11:56.040
We stand alone.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.650
How far up, how far down?

11:57.720 --> 11:59.520
Three miles up, three miles down.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.310
And what company is this?

12:01.390 --> 12:02.790
Easy Company.

12:02.860 --> 12:05.230
And what do we do? Stand alone.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.290
Do not help that man! Do not help that man!

12:08.670 --> 12:10.360
We do not stop.

12:11.870 --> 12:14.800
You've got 30 minutes
to get to the top of this mountain...

12:15.240 --> 12:17.760
...if you want to serve in the Paratroopers.

12:18.210 --> 12:20.770
Hi-ho, Silver!

12:46.670 --> 12:47.860
You can make it up there.

12:47.940 --> 12:48.670
Come on.

12:48.740 --> 12:49.860
Come on, Alley, let's go.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.070
Come on, Guarnere.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.400
Christenson, come on.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.970
I never thought I'd see the day, Private Wynn.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.940
We are coming on 23 minutes.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.570
That may be good enough for the rest of the 506...

13:02.650 --> 13:05.490
...but that is not good enough for Easy Company.

13:15.830 --> 13:18.200
We can make it, we can do this, come on.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.260
I'm going to say something.

13:49.630 --> 13:50.790
To who?

13:54.340 --> 13:55.630
Lieutenant Winters.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.100
What is it?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.070
Permission to speak, sir?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.340
Permission granted.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.470
Sir, we got nine companies, sir.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.270
That we do.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.080
How come we're the only company...

14:08.150 --> 14:12.550
...marching every Friday night, 12 miles,
full pack in the pitch dark?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.680
Why do you think, Private Randleman?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.620
Lieutenant Sobel hates us, sir.

14:22.260 --> 14:25.560
Lieutenant Sobel does not hate Easy Company,
Private Randleman.

14:26.970 --> 14:28.700
He just hates you.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.900
Thank you, sir.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.910
He hates him back.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.270
He hates you, too, Muck.

14:37.350 --> 14:40.980
Lieutenant Winters, I want canteens out of belts
with the caps unscrewed.

14:41.050 --> 14:43.020
Easy Company, canteens out and open.

14:43.190 --> 14:46.280
On my command, they will pour
the contents onto the ground.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.880
On the CO's order, you will upend your canteen.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.050
Now, Lieutenant.

14:50.130 --> 14:51.180
Pour them.

14:57.470 --> 14:58.520
Who is this?

14:59.670 --> 15:00.860
Christenson.

15:00.940 --> 15:03.230
Why is there no water in your canteen?

15:03.310 --> 15:05.030
You drank from your canteen, didn't you?

15:05.310 --> 15:06.970
Lieutenant. Yes, sir.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.880
Was this man ordered to not drink
from his canteen during the Friday night march?

15:11.950 --> 15:12.810
He was, sir.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.370
Private Christenson,
you have disobeyed a direct order.

15:15.450 --> 15:16.640
You will fill your canteen...

15:16.720 --> 15:20.210
...and repeat all 12 miles
of the march immediately.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.260
Yes, sir.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.450
Fall out!

15:31.200 --> 15:34.000
What in the name of God are you doing
with my company?

15:34.570 --> 15:38.440
You're late and you allow troopers
to disobey direct orders?

15:38.510 --> 15:39.840
No excuse, sir.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.700
You're making me look bad, Lieutenant.

15:43.780 --> 15:47.480
This is not Dog Company. This is not Fox Company.

15:47.550 --> 15:50.140
This is Easy Company.

15:50.590 --> 15:52.480
Under my command, this will be the first...

15:52.550 --> 15:54.780
...and finest company in this regiment.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.820
I want the names of six men.

15:59.830 --> 16:04.630
Their infractions and your disciplinary
recommendations on my desk by 0130.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.960
Is that clear?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.960
What infractions, sir?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.830
Find some.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.700
So, what'd you do?

16:18.210 --> 16:20.650
Picked six men and gave them latrine duty.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.280
The lucky six?

16:22.350 --> 16:25.340
McDowell, Toye, Perconte.

16:25.420 --> 16:28.620
Lipton, Muck and Guarnere.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.120
Why them?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.560
It was their turn.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.390
Sobel's a genius.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.690
I had a headmaster just like him in prep school.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.990
I know the type.

16:38.270 --> 16:39.460
Lewis.

16:39.530 --> 16:42.160
Michelangelo's a genius, Beethoven's a genius.

16:42.270 --> 16:46.030
You know a man in this company
who wouldn't double-time Currahee with a full pack...

16:46.110 --> 16:48.540
...just to piss in that guy's morning coffee?

16:49.780 --> 16:51.470
Let's go, let's go.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.380
Stand in the door.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.640
1,000, 2,000.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.310
You just broke both your legs, Private Gordon.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.040
Are you trying to get killed?

17:02.190 --> 17:03.490
No, sir.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.990
Stand in the door.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.329
Shit.

17:27.810 --> 17:28.680
To the wall.

17:28.750 --> 17:29.650
Over as a team.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.550
Go on, against the wall.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.950
Jesus, what the hell is this?

17:35.020 --> 17:37.010
That's pig guts, boy.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.720
Goddamn it!

17:44.460 --> 17:45.900
Why are you here, Private Gordon?

17:45.970 --> 17:47.060
To be in the Airborne, sir.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.620
I don't believe you. Why are you here, Private Gordon?

17:49.700 --> 17:51.070
To be in the Airborne, sir.

17:51.140 --> 17:55.010
You have 50 minutes to the top and back,
and I will be watching you.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.600
What are you waiting for?

18:39.220 --> 18:43.650
Easy Company has the finest performance record
in the entire 2nd Battalion.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.280
I believe every bit of that is thanks to you.

18:48.230 --> 18:49.590
Congratulations, Captain Sobel.

18:49.660 --> 18:50.920
Thank you, sir.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.700
Isn't that Lieutenant Winters
leading Easy Company in PT?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.170
Yes, sir.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.860
He's a damned good man.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.270
I was planning on giving him a set of these today.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.070
Why don't you do it?
He'd be proud to get them from you.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.650
Pornography, contraband.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.550
Non-regulation clothing, contraband.

19:21.730 --> 19:26.030
This man had 200 prophylactic kits in his footlocker.

19:26.330 --> 19:30.700
How in the name of God was he going to have
the strength to fight the war?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.700
How is it Private Tipper...

19:34.070 --> 19:37.530
...has spare time for so much correspondence?

19:38.540 --> 19:41.840
Captain, are personal letters
to be considered contraband?

19:43.450 --> 19:46.110
These men aren't paratroopers yet, Lieutenant.

19:46.190 --> 19:48.380
They have no personal property.

19:52.490 --> 19:53.680
What is this?

19:55.190 --> 19:56.460
Anybody?

19:57.560 --> 19:59.120
It's a can of peaches, sir.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.530
Lieutenant Nixon thinks this is a can of peaches.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
That is incorrect, Lieutenant.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.900
Your weekend pass is cancelled.

20:06.970 --> 20:11.200
This is United States Army property...

20:11.640 --> 20:16.140
...which was taken, without authorization,
from my mess facility...

20:16.280 --> 20:19.720
...and I will not tolerate thievery in my unit.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.340
Whose footlocker is this?

20:21.420 --> 20:23.010
Private Parks, sir.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.420
Get rid of him.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.890
All weekend passes are cancelled.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.720
Officers included.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.430
Carry on.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.330
Lieutenant Winters.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.180
Colonel Sink has seen fit to promote you.

20:52.050 --> 20:55.350
As First Lieutenant,
you'll serve as my executive officer.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.720
Congratulations.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.210
Thank you, sir.

20:59.290 --> 21:06.290
And, as a test of your organizational skills
and command potential...

21:06.370 --> 21:10.530
...I am designating you mess officer for 14 days.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.500
Report to the mess kitchen at 0515 hours.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.370
Company breakfast to be served at 0600.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.040
Yes, sir.

21:21.310 --> 21:24.940
And, Dick, there's rain forecast tomorrow...

21:25.120 --> 21:30.010
...so the company will have a light afternoon
of lecture and classroom instruction.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.050
I think a special meal
before their afternoon off...

21:36.190 --> 21:37.790
...would be a welcome change of pace.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.060
Would you agree?

21:39.130 --> 21:40.030
Yes, sir.

21:41.570 --> 21:42.860
I like spaghetti.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.400
Hold on, more coming.

21:55.010 --> 21:56.710
These guys are packing it away.

22:08.190 --> 22:09.420
This stuff is orange.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.950
Spaghetti ain't supposed to be orange.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.260
This ain't spaghetti.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.320
This is army noodles with ketchup.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.330
You ain't got to eat it.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.730
Oh, come on, Gonorrhea, as a fellow Italian...

22:19.800 --> 22:22.400
...you know that calling this spaghetti is a mortal sin.

22:22.470 --> 22:24.340
I'll have it. No, I'm eating here.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.710
Hey, get out of here.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.670
Orders changed, get up!

22:29.810 --> 22:31.340
Lectures are cancelled.

22:31.420 --> 22:33.750
Easy Company is running up Currahee.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.340
Move, move!

22:38.620 --> 22:41.110
Three miles up, three miles down.

22:41.630 --> 22:44.060
Hi-ho, Silver!

22:44.860 --> 22:46.590
Let's go, let's go.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.860
You're a washout, Private Hoobler!

22:53.940 --> 22:56.300
You should pack up both your ears and go home.

22:56.370 --> 22:57.930
Looks like Gordon's done.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.740
Aren't you, Gordon. You finished?

22:59.810 --> 23:01.900
You do not deserve to get your wings.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.950
Private Randleman, you look tired.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.710
There's an ambulance waiting for you
at the bottom of the hill.

23:07.790 --> 23:10.010
It can all be over right now.

23:10.090 --> 23:12.490
No more pain, no more Currahee.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.920
No more Captain Sobel.

23:15.090 --> 23:18.720
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

23:18.800 --> 23:21.850
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

23:22.070 --> 23:25.430
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

23:25.500 --> 23:28.900
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry

23:29.040 --> 23:32.200
"We pull upon the risers We fall upon the grass

23:32.280 --> 23:35.240
"We never land upon our feet We always hit our ass

23:35.610 --> 23:38.770
"Hide tidee, Christ almighty Who the hell are we?

23:38.980 --> 23:42.180
"Zim zam, goddamn! We're Airborne Infantry"

23:56.230 --> 23:58.890
So, do we feel like we're ready to be army paratroopers?

23:58.970 --> 24:00.160
Yes, Sergeant.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.570
I hope so.

24:01.940 --> 24:06.310
This'll be the first of five exits
from a C-47 aircraft scheduled for today.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.100
Get ready!

24:09.480 --> 24:10.950
Stand up!

24:11.520 --> 24:12.450
Hook up!

24:12.520 --> 24:15.450
Upon successful completion
of your fifth and final jump...

24:15.590 --> 24:17.920
...you'll be certified army paratroopers.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.990
Check equipment!

24:21.490 --> 24:23.820
Sound off for equipment check!

24:24.430 --> 24:25.590
Nine okay.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.820
Eight okay.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.020
Seven okay.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.190
Six okay.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.070
Five okay.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.600
Four okay.

24:33.670 --> 24:34.970
Three okay.

24:35.040 --> 24:35.900
Two okay.

24:35.970 --> 24:36.960
One okay.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.740
There'll be a lot of men dropping from the sky today.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.740
Hopefully, under deployed canopies.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.540
Stand in the door!

24:47.380 --> 24:50.050
I guarantee you're going to love it, Lieutenant.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.920
Go, go!

24:51.990 --> 24:53.960
Jumping from 1,000 feet AGL...

24:54.420 --> 24:57.360
...in sticks of 12 jumpers per aircraft.

24:57.790 --> 25:00.960
All you have to do is remember
what you were taught...

25:01.330 --> 25:04.230
...and I guarantee you,
gravity will take care of the rest.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.360
Go, go, go, go!

25:11.540 --> 25:13.970
Go, go, go!

25:18.250 --> 25:21.080
Go, go, go!

25:48.840 --> 25:50.240
Damn it.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.640
And, gentlemen, rest assured...

25:53.720 --> 25:57.310
...any refusals in the aircraft or at the door...

25:58.490 --> 26:02.550
...and I guarantee you,
you will be out of the Airborne.

26:02.830 --> 26:04.050
Four okay.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.190
Three okay.

26:05.260 --> 26:05.920
Two okay.

26:06.000 --> 26:06.790
One okay.

26:07.260 --> 26:08.630
Stand in the door.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.460
Go!

26:23.950 --> 26:28.440
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000...

26:28.520 --> 26:31.040
...7,000, 8,000, 9,000!

26:35.120 --> 26:36.780
Hi-ho, Silver!

26:42.830 --> 26:45.600
Now just think,
if you had any class or style like me...

26:45.670 --> 26:47.730
...somebody might mistake you for somebody.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.770
You mean like your fucking sergeant?

26:51.470 --> 26:53.030
I'm just kidding.

26:55.950 --> 26:57.280
Congratulations, Martin.

26:57.350 --> 27:01.340
Corporal Toye, there will be
no leaning in my company.

27:02.550 --> 27:05.180
Are those dusty jump wings?

27:05.620 --> 27:09.110
How do you expect to slay the Huns
with dust on your jump wings?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.790
Luz, just give me a drink.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.660
Hell of an idea, Joe.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.290
There you go.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.030
Three miles up, three miles down.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.270
Ten-hut!

27:33.780 --> 27:35.580
Well, at ease, paratroopers.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.910
Good evening, Easy Company.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.610
Evening, sir.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.350
Now, Parachute Infantry is a brand-new concept...

27:43.420 --> 27:45.080
...in American military history.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.090
But, by God, the 506 is going
to forge that brand-new concept...

27:48.160 --> 27:49.130
...into victory.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.290
Yes, sir.

27:50.470 --> 27:54.130
I want you to know that I'm damned proud
of each and every one of you.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.470
Now, you deserve this party.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.160
Thank you, Sergeant Grant.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.300
Sir.

27:59.410 --> 28:03.100
So, I want you to have fun and remember our motto:

28:03.180 --> 28:04.270
Currahee!

28:04.350 --> 28:06.110
Currahee!

28:32.770 --> 28:33.970
Petty.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.240
Map.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.210
Come on.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.940
Ah, Christ.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.890
We're in the wrong position.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.630
We're in the wrong position.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.860
We're textbook position for ambush, sir.

29:00.030 --> 29:03.400
We should sit tight,
let the enemy team come into our killing zone.

29:03.470 --> 29:04.900
They're right out there somewhere.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.400
Let's just get them.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.300
Sir, we have perfect cover here.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.410
Lieutenant, deploy your troops.

29:13.150 --> 29:15.940
2nd Platoon, move out.

29:16.180 --> 29:16.980
What?

29:17.050 --> 29:18.180
Tactical column.

29:37.940 --> 29:41.900
Captain, you've just been killed,
along with 95 percent of your company.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.640
Your outfit?

29:44.650 --> 29:47.340
Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th.

29:51.020 --> 29:55.420
Leave three wounded men on the ground
and report back to the assembly area.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.950
Goddamn it.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.860
You, you, you.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.230
Well, what are you going to do?

30:10.300 --> 30:12.240
Nothing, just keep training the men.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.440
Am I interrupting?

30:17.210 --> 30:18.770
No, no.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.970
Lieutenant Lewis Nixon.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.610
Lieutenant Harry Welsh, just in from the 82nd.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.980
Congratulations on the promotion.

30:25.050 --> 30:26.950
Thanks, if you want to call it that.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.420
You'll learn him pretty quickly.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.820
No flaws, no vices, no sense of humor.

30:32.460 --> 30:35.360
Just like your chums up at battalion staff.

30:36.030 --> 30:37.260
What's up?

30:38.030 --> 30:39.790
I'm hearing a lot of rumblings.

30:39.900 --> 30:40.990
Sobel?

30:41.070 --> 30:42.630
Just talking about that.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.970
So, he gets a little jumpy in the field?

30:46.270 --> 30:48.430
He gets jumpy and then you get killed.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.070
That's nice.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.540
Yeah, listen, if we discuss it,
I think it should just be amongst ourselves.

30:53.610 --> 30:54.840
Absolutely.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.710
2nd Platoon, ready?

31:04.790 --> 31:05.880
Ready, sir.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.150
Then get them in formation.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.320
We're moving out.

31:10.460 --> 31:11.760
Yes, sir.

31:36.790 --> 31:38.450
Shut up, Cobb.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.790
You got to admit it.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.290
He's got no chance.

31:41.560 --> 31:45.120
Either the Krauts will get him or one of us.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.930
Who, Sobel?

31:47.370 --> 31:49.130
He screwed up one maneuver.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.960
Well, you know, I'm always fumbling with grenades.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.200
It would be easy if one went off by accident, you know?

31:55.270 --> 31:58.370
Well, now they must have put him in charge for a reason.

31:59.110 --> 32:02.380
Yeah, 'cause the Army wouldn't make a mistake, right?

32:17.130 --> 32:19.960
Going my way? Wherever the train takes me.

32:20.030 --> 32:22.190
Where do you suppose that might be?
I haven't got a clue.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.860
Yeah, come on, take a guess.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.590
Atlantic, Pacific, Atlantic?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.870
I'm not the intelligence officer.

32:30.380 --> 32:34.280
Well, as such, I, of course, know,
but if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.780
So, don't tell me.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.480
New York City.

32:40.690 --> 32:41.850
Troopship.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.280
England.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.850
We're invading Europe, my friend.

32:48.830 --> 32:50.520
Fortress Europa.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.150
Since when do I drink?

32:56.330 --> 32:59.170
If I thought you'd drink it,
I wouldn't offer it to you.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.970
Nix?

33:03.510 --> 33:06.100
What are you going to do
when you get into combat?

33:07.850 --> 33:10.410
I have every confidence
in my scrounging abilities.

33:12.020 --> 33:16.320
And I have a case of VAT 69
hidden in your footlocker.

33:20.430 --> 33:21.250
Really?

33:21.330 --> 33:22.090
Oh, yeah.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.620
'Morning.

33:28.230 --> 33:30.200
This could turn into a real nice trip.

33:46.550 --> 33:48.540
"Dear sir or madam:

33:49.020 --> 33:54.010
"Soon your son will drop from the sky
to engage and defeat the enemy.

33:54.430 --> 33:57.290
"Your frequent letters of love and encouragement...

33:57.360 --> 33:59.830
"...will arm him with a fighting heart.

34:00.430 --> 34:04.390
"With that he cannot fail,
but will win glory for himself...

34:04.540 --> 34:08.060
"...make you proud of him,
and his country ever grateful...

34:08.139 --> 34:10.570
"...for his service in its hour of need.

34:10.940 --> 34:14.310
"Signed, Herbert M. Sobel,
Captain Commanding."

34:27.389 --> 34:31.350
Right now, some lucky bastard's headed
for the South Pacific.

34:31.429 --> 34:32.400
Oh, what I'd give.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.050
He's going to get billeted on some tropical island.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.000
Keep talking.

34:36.070 --> 34:39.090
Sitting under a palm tree
with six naked native girls...

34:39.170 --> 34:42.830
...helping him cut up coconuts
so he can hand-feed them to the flamingos.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.130
Flamingos are mean.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.469
They bite.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.170
So do the naked native girls.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.400
With any luck.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.739
Hey, guys, I'm glad I'm going to Europe.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.780
Hitler gets one of these right across the windpipe.

34:54.920 --> 34:58.010
Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving to Joe Toye Day...

34:58.090 --> 35:01.580
...and pays me $10,000 a year
for the rest of my fucking life.

35:02.490 --> 35:04.320
What if we don't get to Europe?

35:04.390 --> 35:06.220
What if they send us to North Africa?

35:06.300 --> 35:07.420
My brother's in North Africa.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.620
He says it's hot.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.530
Really, it's hot in Africa?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.120
Shut up.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.170
The point is, it don't matter where we go.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.300
In combat, the only person you can trust...

35:16.370 --> 35:18.530
...is yourself and the fellow next to you.

35:18.610 --> 35:21.580
Hey, as long as he's a paratrooper.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.510
Oh, yeah?

35:22.580 --> 35:25.550
And what if that paratrooper turns out to be Sobel?

35:25.620 --> 35:29.310
If I'm next to Sobel in combat,
I'm moving on down the line.

35:29.620 --> 35:33.450
Hook up with some other officer,
like Heyliger or Winters.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.290
I like Winters, he's a good man.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.330
But when the bullets start flying...

35:37.390 --> 35:40.090
...I don't know if I want a Quaker
doing my fighting for me.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.150
How do you know he's a Quaker?

35:42.230 --> 35:43.390
He ain't Catholic.

35:43.470 --> 35:44.660
Neither is Sobel.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.570
That prick's a son of Abraham.

35:47.700 --> 35:48.970
He's what?

35:49.210 --> 35:50.540
He's a Jew.

35:54.410 --> 35:55.340
I'm a Jew.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.700
Congratulations.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.910
Get your nose out of my face.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.080
What's all that about?

36:09.390 --> 36:11.330
Gonorrhea called Sobel a Jew.

36:11.630 --> 36:14.120
Liebgott took offense 'cause he's a Jew too.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.400
Fighting over Sobel, that's smart.

36:36.590 --> 36:38.050
Attack!

36:41.390 --> 36:43.820
No, you want to kill him!

36:43.890 --> 36:45.830
Parry right, parry left.

36:46.000 --> 36:46.930
Thrust!

36:47.230 --> 36:48.290
Take cover.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.660
Okay.

36:50.270 --> 36:54.000
Yesterday, we talked about magnetic declination...

36:54.070 --> 36:56.500
...and the "left add, right subtract" rule.

36:56.570 --> 36:58.130
Today we're putting it into practice.

36:58.570 --> 37:01.370
There are two basic types of fighting positions.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.310
The first is the prepared position.

37:04.380 --> 37:10.120
The advantages of a prepared position
are that it gives you cover and concealment.

37:10.190 --> 37:11.850
Commence fire!

37:16.160 --> 37:19.390
We'll then maneuver right in through these trees.

37:19.460 --> 37:24.230
At the same time, our second platoon,
in this particular case, moves over here.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.670
He's then going to close with
and kill or capture that German.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.390
Sobel's late.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.000
Why is there a fence here?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.340
There should be no fence here.

38:13.650 --> 38:15.050
Give me the map.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.610
Perconte, Luz.

38:19.690 --> 38:21.620
Get the men, get them...

38:21.690 --> 38:23.380
Take cover behind those trees.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.890
You heard the word. Let's go over there.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.960
There should be no...
There should be no fence here.

38:33.030 --> 38:35.000
We could go over it, sir.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.630
Really?

38:36.810 --> 38:39.070
That's not the point. Where the goddamn...

38:39.240 --> 38:41.210
Where the goddamn hell are we?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.270
Perconte? Yeah.

38:44.350 --> 38:46.710
Sobel's lost again, right? Yeah, he's lost.

38:46.780 --> 38:47.910
Fucking Christ.

38:51.890 --> 38:53.940
Can you do Major Horton?

38:54.660 --> 38:57.720
Does a wild bear crap in the woods, son?

38:58.630 --> 39:00.820
Maybe the good major can goose this schmuck.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.160
Get us moving?

39:02.600 --> 39:03.590
No way.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.890
Yes. You got to.

39:07.340 --> 39:08.960
All right, just this once.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.570
Three-five-six-eight-three-three.

39:17.650 --> 39:18.800
Isn't that the intersection?

39:18.880 --> 39:20.070
No, sir, it's here.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.510
You're a full grid off.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.750
Goddamn it.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.440
Is there a problem, Captain Sobel?

39:26.520 --> 39:27.610
Who said that?

39:27.720 --> 39:29.020
Who broke silence?

39:29.490 --> 39:31.890
I think it's Major Horton, sir.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.220
Major Horton?

39:35.300 --> 39:36.960
What is he... Did he join us?

39:37.730 --> 39:40.260
I think maybe he's moving between the platoons, sir.

39:40.340 --> 39:44.170
What is the goddamn holdup, Mr. Sobel?

39:46.340 --> 39:48.270
A fence, sir.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.800
God!

39:50.210 --> 39:51.910
A barbed wire fence.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.040
Oh, that dog just ain't going to hunt!

39:56.420 --> 40:00.610
Now, you cut that fence
and get this goddamn platoon on the move!

40:02.620 --> 40:03.920
Yes, sir!

40:06.490 --> 40:08.550
Where are my goddamn wire cutters?

40:10.670 --> 40:11.930
We have to move.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.470
Sir, without Captain Sobel and 1st Platoon?

40:15.240 --> 40:18.000
It's a T-intersection. We improvise.

40:18.140 --> 40:22.170
Double envelopment laid on a base of fire
to cut the road in all directions.

40:22.280 --> 40:25.800
Hook right with first squad.
Tell Guarnere to move left with second.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.940
I'll be right up the middle with third, go. Yes, sir.

40:51.370 --> 40:52.840
Deary me.

41:04.050 --> 41:05.450
Bloody hell.

41:25.110 --> 41:27.000
You've done it now, Yanks.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.270
You've captured me.

41:32.650 --> 41:35.380
Hi-ho, Silver!

41:39.250 --> 41:41.190
Would that be the enemy?

41:41.620 --> 41:43.710
As a matter of fact, yes.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.130
Good work, 2nd Platoon.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.600
We took the objective.

42:03.810 --> 42:06.940
Who is the idiot who cut that man's fence?

42:07.010 --> 42:08.170
I was ordered to, sir.

42:08.250 --> 42:09.080
By whom?

42:09.150 --> 42:10.340
Major Horton, sir.

42:10.420 --> 42:11.850
Major Horton? Yes, sir.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.310
Major Horton told you to do that? Yes, sir.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.420
Major Horton ordered you to cut the fence?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.590
Yes, he did.

42:19.860 --> 42:23.390
Major Horton is on leave in London.

42:26.170 --> 42:27.790
Get those cows out of here.

42:56.930 --> 42:58.230
Lieutenant Winters.

43:01.770 --> 43:03.790
With Captain Sobel's compliments, sir.

43:07.070 --> 43:08.130
Lieutenant.

43:27.490 --> 43:29.120
Oh, for crying out loud.

43:29.430 --> 43:31.400
This spells court-martial.

43:31.460 --> 43:33.560
Wide open! Yes.

43:37.300 --> 43:39.270
No, sir, I do not understand.

43:39.670 --> 43:43.130
Your orders to me were
to inspect the latrines at 1000 hours.

43:43.210 --> 43:48.710
From 0930 to 0955 I was censoring the enlisted men's mail
by order of Colonel Strayer.

43:49.580 --> 43:52.680
At 1000 hours I followed
your orders to the minute.

43:52.750 --> 43:55.410
I changed that time to 0945.

43:55.490 --> 43:56.550
No one told me, sir.

43:56.620 --> 43:57.680
I telephoned.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.190
I'm quartered with a family that has no telephone.

44:00.260 --> 44:01.660
And sent a runner.

44:01.730 --> 44:03.160
No runner found me, Captain.

44:03.230 --> 44:11.640
Irregardless, when given a task to perform by a ranking officer
you should have delegated your task of latrine inspection to another officer.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.140
You failed to do so.

44:13.510 --> 44:17.130
Were I to let such a failure of duty
by my own XO go unpunished...

44:17.210 --> 44:19.510
...what kind of message is that to the men?

44:19.610 --> 44:21.870
I performed my duty as I was ordered, sir.

44:22.110 --> 44:23.550
And I disagree.

44:23.780 --> 44:27.010
So, your options are quite simple, Lieutenant.

44:27.720 --> 44:32.620
Punishment for your offenses will be denial
of a 48-hour pass for 60 days.

44:32.690 --> 44:34.820
Stand before me at attention.

44:37.900 --> 44:42.300
Or you may initiate a letter of appeal
and request a trial by court-martial.

44:47.210 --> 44:49.070
You spend your weekends on the base anyway, Dick.

44:49.140 --> 44:51.070
Be a man, take the punishment.

44:52.510 --> 44:54.370
May I borrow your pen, sir?

45:06.360 --> 45:07.880
My endorsement, sir.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.690
I request trial by court-martial.

45:23.310 --> 45:25.140
We lost Winters to battalion mess.

45:25.710 --> 45:27.440
You're shitting me. No.

45:27.510 --> 45:31.470
Strayer did it, while they try to figure out
the procedures for his court-martial.

45:31.550 --> 45:33.680
Nix better find a loophole and get him out.

45:33.750 --> 45:34.840
And if he don't?

45:35.090 --> 45:38.750
Winters scrambles eggs while the rest of us
make the big jump with Sobel.

45:40.560 --> 45:41.790
Not me.

45:42.590 --> 45:44.930
So we're going through with this, right?

45:45.330 --> 45:46.890
We've got to do something.

45:46.970 --> 45:48.190
Yeah.

45:49.800 --> 45:50.890
All right.

45:51.700 --> 45:52.960
Good.

45:54.610 --> 45:56.660
But we'd all better be clear on the consequences.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.940
I don't care about the consequences.

46:00.310 --> 46:03.070
We could be lined up against a wall and shot.

46:05.050 --> 46:06.950
Now, I'm ready to face that.

46:08.650 --> 46:10.920
And every one of us had better be, too.

46:16.560 --> 46:20.050
I will not follow that man into combat.

46:23.230 --> 46:24.360
Me neither.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.630
All right.

46:30.170 --> 46:31.400
Then let's do it.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.950
"I hereby...

46:48.690 --> 46:53.280
"...no longer wish to serve...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.020
"...as a non-commissioned officer...

47:05.240 --> 47:06.800
"...in Easy Company."

47:20.720 --> 47:22.090
All right, boys.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.250
Good luck.

47:28.730 --> 47:30.290
I ought to have you all shot!

47:31.230 --> 47:33.360
This is nothing less than an act of mutiny...

47:33.440 --> 47:36.500
...while we prepare for the goddamn invasion of Europe.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.160
Sergeant Harris.

47:38.310 --> 47:38.970
Sir.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.030
Turn in your stripes, collect your gear.

47:41.110 --> 47:43.870
You are hereby transferred out of my regiment.

47:44.110 --> 47:44.810
Sir.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.710
Get out.

47:47.380 --> 47:48.650
Sergeant Ranney.

47:48.790 --> 47:50.010
Sir.

47:50.120 --> 47:53.250
You consider yourself lucky,
I'm only busting you to private.

47:53.460 --> 47:57.360
All of you NCOs have disgraced the 101st Airborne.

47:57.430 --> 48:02.360
Consider yourself lucky that we are on the eve
of the largest action in the history of warfare...

48:02.470 --> 48:06.330
...which leaves me no choice but to spare your lives.

48:09.710 --> 48:12.470
Now, get out of my office and get out of my sight.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.200
Get.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.590
Keep them coming, atta-boy.

49:06.400 --> 49:10.020
I can only speculate, sir.
Most of the men would never do this...

49:10.100 --> 49:14.190
...but I believe just a few
of the sergeants may have felt...

49:14.270 --> 49:18.070
...their loyalty lay more to the platoon
than to the company.

49:18.970 --> 49:22.570
And these few sergeants convinced
all of the other NCOs in your company...

49:22.650 --> 49:23.910
...to turn in their stripes?

49:23.980 --> 49:25.940
As staff sergeants,
they have a great amount of influence, sir.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.740
But as I say, the rest are good men.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.240
I know them, I can work with them.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.720
This business with the Winters' court-martial...

49:39.800 --> 49:41.990
...has been an unpleasant distraction.

49:42.060 --> 49:44.050
Indeed it has, sir.

49:44.730 --> 49:46.220
However...

49:46.870 --> 49:49.670
...your command of Easy Company has been exemplary.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.530
Thank you, sir.

49:52.170 --> 49:56.580
In fact, except for the actions
of a few of your non-coms...

49:57.280 --> 50:01.810
...I believe you've fielded
one of the finest companies of soldiers I've ever seen.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.040
Yes, sir.

50:04.390 --> 50:06.880
Herbert, Division has established...

50:06.960 --> 50:09.390
...a parachute training school at Chilton Foliat.

50:09.460 --> 50:12.910
The idea is for non-infantry types who...

50:13.600 --> 50:15.560
...were vital to the coming invasion...

50:15.630 --> 50:19.330
...such as doctors and chaplains,
to take jump training there.

50:20.970 --> 50:23.100
I can't think of anyone more qualified...

50:23.170 --> 50:25.730
...to command such a school than you are.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.580
Sir?

50:33.920 --> 50:36.210
I'm reassigning you to Chilton Foliat.

50:45.430 --> 50:47.390
I'm losing Easy Company?

50:47.530 --> 50:49.520
The war effort needs you elsewhere.

50:56.570 --> 50:58.060
Permission to speak, sir?

50:58.210 --> 50:59.370
Granted.

51:03.810 --> 51:06.370
Is... Who will be replacing me?

51:06.580 --> 51:09.740
Lieutenant Meehan from Baker Company is senior.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.290
Good luck at Chilton Foliat, Herbert.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.950
Don't let us down now.

51:22.860 --> 51:23.920
No, sir.

51:31.270 --> 51:33.070
Carry on.

52:26.330 --> 52:27.760
2nd Platoon, listen up.

52:27.860 --> 52:30.660
I want the first squad and A-side tents right up there.

52:31.230 --> 52:33.630
Third squad, second row...

52:48.080 --> 52:49.880
Holy shit.

52:51.220 --> 52:53.150
No, it's all right. We're tommies...

52:53.220 --> 52:54.580
...not bleeding boche.

52:54.660 --> 52:55.850
Is all this real?

52:55.960 --> 52:56.940
Yeah, yeah.

52:57.020 --> 52:59.720
Some is from the Hermans,
somebody's tailor's knocked up.

52:59.790 --> 53:02.760
For you, so you can get your mince pies
on this Jerry clobber...

53:02.830 --> 53:04.160
...if you know what I mean.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.390
Not really.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.290
Mack, you got a Luger?

53:07.370 --> 53:09.030
I'm dying to get a real Luger.

53:09.100 --> 53:10.300
Yeah, go on then.

53:12.470 --> 53:14.030
A quick butchers, yeah?

53:18.050 --> 53:19.940
Boy, she sure is a doozy.

53:20.010 --> 53:21.310
Yeah, it's pukka, ain't it?

53:21.380 --> 53:22.310
What?

53:23.780 --> 53:25.340
Hey, Petty.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.120
Hey, mate.

53:28.860 --> 53:31.720
You're having a bath if you think
you're half-inching that.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.520
Oh, yeah.

53:33.590 --> 53:35.320
Sorry. Well, good luck.

53:35.560 --> 53:36.590
You too, mate.

53:38.300 --> 53:39.730
What's up, Hoobs?

53:40.630 --> 53:44.630
These men have been through
the toughest training the Army has to offer.

53:44.770 --> 53:46.860
Under the worst possible circumstances.

53:47.970 --> 53:49.500
And they volunteered for it.

53:49.580 --> 53:52.670
Christ, I was just shooting craps with them.
It's not like...

53:52.750 --> 53:54.540
You know why they volunteered?

53:54.610 --> 53:59.520
So, when things got really bad,
the man next to them would be the best.

54:00.150 --> 54:02.710
Not some draftee who's going to get him killed.

54:02.790 --> 54:04.760
Are you ticked because they like me?

54:05.190 --> 54:07.780
Because I'm spending time
to get to know my soldiers?

54:07.860 --> 54:10.820
You've been with these guys for what,
two years?

54:10.900 --> 54:12.420
I've been here for six days.

54:13.830 --> 54:14.960
You're gambling, Bob.

54:15.030 --> 54:16.860
So what? Soldiers do that.

54:16.940 --> 54:18.840
I don't deserve a reprimand for it.

54:19.310 --> 54:20.900
What if you'd won?

54:22.540 --> 54:25.700
What? What if you'd won?

54:30.820 --> 54:34.440
Never put yourself in a position
where you can take from these men.

54:39.990 --> 54:41.020
Lieutenant Meehan?

54:41.090 --> 54:42.120
Enter.

54:44.700 --> 54:48.000
On the last training jump, I had a compass.

54:49.370 --> 54:50.990
Close the flap.

54:53.210 --> 54:54.170
Then we turn left.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.230
Yeah.

54:55.310 --> 54:58.070
Bearing zero-four-two.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.340
12 minutes.

54:59.410 --> 55:00.940
Then another left?

55:02.250 --> 55:04.610
Call it three-five-eight...

55:05.890 --> 55:07.510
...for 10 and a half minutes.

55:08.320 --> 55:10.880
Green light, right over Ramsbury.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.010
Ramsbury.

55:12.090 --> 55:13.720
Every single time.

55:14.630 --> 55:18.080
Linear distance on the grid of about...

55:20.870 --> 55:21.730
Okay.

55:21.800 --> 55:22.820
Ramsbury.

55:24.370 --> 55:25.560
Upottery.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.300
So...

55:35.580 --> 55:36.810
It's Normandy.

55:38.020 --> 55:39.210
St. Marie du Mont.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.840
Causeway Number One.

55:40.990 --> 55:42.610
Causeway Number Two.

55:42.690 --> 55:44.350
The ultimate field problem.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.750
The estuary of the Douve River
divides two beachheads...

55:48.830 --> 55:52.420
...code-named Utah, here, and Omaha, here.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.790
Seaborne Infantry
will hit these beaches in force...

55:55.870 --> 55:58.060
...at a date and time to be specified.

55:58.470 --> 56:00.630
H-hour, D-day.

56:00.770 --> 56:05.070
Airborne's objective, gentlemen,
is to take the town of Carentan...

56:05.140 --> 56:09.010
...thus linking Utah and Omaha
into a single, continuous beachhead.

56:09.080 --> 56:12.520
...linking Omaha and Utah
into one continuous beachhead.

56:13.180 --> 56:16.050
Each trooper will learn
this operation by heart...

56:16.150 --> 56:19.590
...and know his and every other outfits'
mission to the detail.

56:19.660 --> 56:20.420
Meehan?

56:20.490 --> 56:21.690
Yes, Dukeman.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.060
Sir, are we dropping tonight?

56:23.130 --> 56:25.120
When it's time for you to know,
we'll let you know.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.760
In the meantime, study these sand tables,
maps, and reconnaissance photos...

56:29.830 --> 56:32.560
...until you can draw
a map of the area by memory.

56:32.800 --> 56:39.510
Now, we will drop behind this Atlantic wall
five hours before the 4th Infantry lands at Utah.

56:39.610 --> 56:42.880
And between our assembly area
and the battalion's objective...

56:42.950 --> 56:47.250
...there is a German garrison right here
in this area, St. Marie du Mont.

56:47.520 --> 56:50.820
Easy Company will destroy that garrison.

56:53.290 --> 56:56.920
Three-day supply of K rations,
chocolate bars, charms, candy...

56:57.000 --> 56:58.990
...powdered coffee, sugar, and matches.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.020
Compass, bayonet, entrenching tool,
ammunition, gas mask.

57:03.100 --> 57:07.500
Musette bag with ammo, my webbing,
my.45, canteen...

57:07.570 --> 57:09.000
...two cartons of smokes.

57:09.070 --> 57:12.060
Hawkins mine, two grenades,
smoke grenade, gamma grenade...

57:12.140 --> 57:15.740
...TNT, this bullshit,
and a pair of nasty skivvies.

57:15.810 --> 57:16.900
What's your point?

57:16.980 --> 57:18.350
This weighs as much as I do.

57:18.420 --> 57:21.480
I've still got my chute, my reserve chute,
my Mae West, my M-1.

57:21.550 --> 57:23.750
Where are you keeping your brass knuckles?

57:24.220 --> 57:26.190
I could use some brass knuckles.

57:26.990 --> 57:28.360
Hey, anything for me?

57:28.430 --> 57:28.430
No.

57:28.430 --> 57:31.720
Sergeant Martin.

57:38.470 --> 57:40.200
For Talbert.

57:44.470 --> 57:45.530
Heavy! Condoms?

57:45.610 --> 57:46.970
I don't know, probably.

57:47.040 --> 57:47.870
What you got?

57:47.980 --> 57:50.540
"Dear Floyd: Give them hell."

57:51.050 --> 57:52.810
It's from the chief of the Kokomo Police.

57:52.880 --> 57:53.940
Right.

57:57.790 --> 57:59.620
You've got to love cops.

57:59.820 --> 58:01.880
All right, listen up, listen up.

58:02.590 --> 58:06.620
If you did not sign your GI life insurance policy...

58:06.960 --> 58:11.370
...you go on over and see Sergeant Evans
at the headquarters company tent.

58:12.570 --> 58:16.000
You boys don't let your families
miss out on $10,000.

58:17.040 --> 58:18.170
You hear that, Gerry?

58:18.240 --> 58:19.040
Hey, Lip?

58:19.110 --> 58:20.080
Yeah, boy.

58:23.050 --> 58:25.170
Has Guarnere said anything about his brother?

58:25.250 --> 58:26.210
No.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.440
I got a problem.

58:28.020 --> 58:31.450
My wife keeps up with things back home,
casualty lists and like that.

58:31.520 --> 58:32.540
Yeah?

58:32.860 --> 58:34.450
Guarnere's brother in Italy?

58:34.520 --> 58:35.720
Henry?

58:35.990 --> 58:37.460
Killed in Monte Cassino.

58:39.430 --> 58:41.020
Well, I'm sure he doesn't know.

58:41.100 --> 58:41.930
Damn.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.660
What'd you think I should do?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.200
If it were me, I'd tell him.

58:47.870 --> 58:49.860
Couple of hours before we jump?

58:51.040 --> 58:52.770
I don't know.

59:02.020 --> 59:04.510
Why are they springing these things on us now?

59:05.220 --> 59:08.280
It's just an extra 80 pounds
strapped to your leg.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.920
Does anybody have any idea
how the hell this thing works?

59:12.760 --> 59:14.790
Colonel Sink.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.000
Colonel Sink.

59:20.540 --> 59:22.440
"Soldiers of the regiment.

59:22.810 --> 59:27.870
"Tonight is the night of nights.

59:28.750 --> 59:30.940
"Today, as you read this...

59:31.150 --> 59:34.880
"...you are en route to the great adventure
for which you have trained...

59:34.950 --> 59:37.010
"...for over two years."

59:37.290 --> 59:39.310
So, that's why they gave us ice cream.

59:42.190 --> 59:44.560
Easy Company, listen up!

59:47.060 --> 59:49.760
Channel coast is socked in with rain and fog.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.430
No jump tonight.

59:53.100 --> 59:55.190
The invasion has been postponed.

59:55.540 --> 59:57.700
We're on a 24-hour stand-down.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.670
Well, this is quite a surprise.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.940
Not particularly.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.040
It so happens I rather expected it.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:13.350
Well, I can't see how you people
can pass up $80,000 for the Cause.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.580
For whose cause?

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.480
If you're so interested in serving a cause...

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.890
...why don't you join the Army?

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.450
Next, please.

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:25.600
Oh, 4F.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.070
You look 1A to me.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.070
You don't look so bad yourself.

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.100
"Dearest Johnny"?

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.970
Well, should you be giving blood?

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.240
I woke up.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.210
I got the wrong goddamn jacket.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.910
I was struck by lightning.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.820
Nobody dancing.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.050
It doesn't matter.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.420
"Your pal, Bill Guarnere's brother..."

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.720
Good luck, lads.

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:33.120
See you, tommies.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.460
See you, mate.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.400
Try and get these leg straps through.

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.640
Johnny?

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.920
Got something you might be looking for.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.290
Took your jacket by mistake.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.560
I'm sorry.

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:10.030
You read it?

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.960
Where the fuck is Monte Cassino?

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.000
I don't know. Italy somewhere.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.170
Sorry about your brother, Bill.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.470
I'm sorry for my ma.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.110
He was...

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.080
Let's get this over with.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.590
Bill?

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.260
I'll meet up with you over there.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.540
Gentlemen, Doc Roe is handing
these out for air sickness.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.470
Orders are, "Every man takes one now,
another, 30 minutes in the air."

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.370
Lieutenant.

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.680
2nd Platoon, listen up.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.650
Good luck.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.850
God bless you.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:17.530
I'll see you in the assembly area.

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:16.750
If the wire contacts are sensitive,
then I think all we should have to do...

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.620
Goddamn, Lieb.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.690
That airsick pill is making me loopy.
