00:01.929 --> 00:04.070
- Previously:
- His son's part of the prophecy.

00:04.929 --> 00:07.179
The Nyazian scroll said
it wouldn't be born.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.169
Darla died during childbirth.

00:11.529 --> 00:13.699
She sacrificed herself for the child.

00:13.929 --> 00:16.699
I'm his family. My job is
to be everything for him.

00:17.530 --> 00:20.199
- We have to get that baby.
- Bogey at the back door!

00:20.530 --> 00:22.420
Everyone will come for him.

00:22.929 --> 00:26.859
- No one will touch this child.
- The visions are killing me.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.309
Humans can't handle the visions.
Only demons can.

00:31.929 --> 00:35.189
So demonize me already.

00:36.729 --> 00:39.399
We have to solve my vision.
The one I'm having now.

00:39.729 --> 00:41.799
- Cordy....
- What?

00:42.130 --> 00:44.549
Holtz, Daniel.
Vampire killer. Circa 1754.

00:45.130 --> 00:48.289
I know what it's like to grieve.
I want to help you.

00:49.329 --> 00:51.219
Stay the hell away from me.

00:59.530 --> 01:02.020
- I'll teach you to fight.
- What's in it for you?

01:02.530 --> 01:05.060
- Help me kill a vampire.
- You don't need me.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.719
I do. This vampire is strong.

01:14.530 --> 01:18.180
Sixty. Seventy. Eighty.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.659
One. Two. Three.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.640
Angel.

01:27.730 --> 01:29.549
How's the Connor fund?

01:30.129 --> 01:32.090
There was $1.83 in change
in the cushions.

01:32.530 --> 01:35.510
That's perfectly good money
just laying around.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.670
- How's it going?
- Moments away.

01:42.129 --> 01:43.500
Make that bigger.

01:45.129 --> 01:47.480
Bold but, you know, tasteful.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.819
Tasteful. Sure.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.959
You are so cute. Yes, you are.

01:55.329 --> 01:58.209
You're just the best little boy
in the whole world.

01:58.930 --> 02:04.129
- How's my little man?
- Where has his father been?

02:04.930 --> 02:06.819
Papa's got mouths to feed.

02:07.329 --> 02:11.330
I have a mouth too.
Always have had one.

02:12.129 --> 02:17.259
Kind of known for it,
and we've fed it fine for years. Yes.

02:20.530 --> 02:25.169
Angel, I'm glad you wanna
take care of your son. I am.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.000
Just don't lose sight of the mission.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.750
We have to earn money.
Not just for Connor.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.719
First and foremost,
we work for The Powers.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.169
Help the helpless.
Promise me we won't neglect that.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.990
I promise. I promise. Well?

02:41.530 --> 02:44.270
We hired some guys.
6000 of these all over town.

02:45.129 --> 02:47.900
Nice! I'd call me. Wouldn't you?

02:48.729 --> 02:51.849
Hey, the website's up. We're live.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.189
We're live, little guy. Come on.

02:55.930 --> 02:59.050
Beautiful. We're online.
We got flyers, yellow pages.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.789
Welcome to a new era
of Angel Investigations.

03:03.729 --> 03:08.750
All we do now is wait for that phone
to ring and the money to roll in.

03:09.729 --> 03:13.379
Because someone's gotta clothe and
educate and feed this little guy, huh?

03:18.729 --> 03:23.300
Yep. All we have to do is wait.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.360
It's just a matter of time.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.289
Don't worry. This town's full
of people with problems.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074

04:05.530 --> 04:07.490
Come on, come on!

04:09.729 --> 04:11.409
Come on!

04:13.330 --> 04:14.629
Fabrizio's Pizza.

04:19.930 --> 04:22.699
Is this the right phone number?

05:23.850 --> 05:27.430
That's the last of them.
Six thousand new ones.

05:40.649 --> 05:43.279
- Adorable.
- So sweet.

05:45.449 --> 05:49.699
- I meant the baby.
- I meant the hot mama.

05:52.050 --> 05:55.600
- Sorry about the mix-up.
- We can't afford more mistakes.

05:56.250 --> 06:00.180
Making mistakes costs money and
money's our number one priority. Lorne.

06:01.050 --> 06:04.000
If this is about the baby
formula I snagged, sorry.

06:04.649 --> 06:07.250
It was that or a glass of pig's blood.

06:07.649 --> 06:10.250
By the way, baby formula
and Kahlúa, not bad.

06:11.250 --> 06:15.459
Find out what Holtz is up to.
He's out there. We can't forget it.

06:16.050 --> 06:17.870
- He's our number one priority.
- I thought--

06:18.449 --> 06:21.610
Finding Holtz and making money
are our two priorities.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.769
Helping the helpless, Holtz...

06:24.449 --> 06:27.750
...and making money are
our three number one priorities.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.209
Hey, look, we've got
some hits on our website!

06:33.449 --> 06:34.889
Angel Investigations.
May I help you?

06:36.449 --> 06:37.889
Angel Investigations.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.250
- Absolutely.
- We're in business.

06:43.050 --> 06:45.540
You should be thanking me.

06:46.050 --> 06:48.189
For disobeying an order?

06:49.050 --> 06:51.610
For dusting two vamps.

06:52.050 --> 06:55.740
Two vampires from whom
I had told you to walk away.

06:56.250 --> 07:01.060
- Guess I misunderstood.
- Which is why we're here.

07:02.250 --> 07:05.689
Would a couple light bulbs
and some plumbing kill you?

07:05.850 --> 07:08.240
We are here to determine
whether or not...

07:08.850 --> 07:13.660
...you have the commitment
necessary for the work at hand.

07:14.850 --> 07:18.850
At hand? That's a joke, right?

07:19.649 --> 07:22.879
Why are you wasting my time?

07:23.850 --> 07:25.459
What do you want from me?

07:26.250 --> 07:28.949
I just told you. Commitment.

07:29.250 --> 07:32.660
Something you must now
convince me you have.

07:40.649 --> 07:44.509
So I've explained why
I'm doing this. Why are you?

07:46.649 --> 07:51.040
Let's just say feeling something
is better than feeling nothing.

07:52.050 --> 07:55.949
Take it out anytime you like.
If you're here when I return...

07:56.850 --> 08:00.709
...we'll consider the next phase
of our partnership.

08:11.970 --> 08:14.709
Welcome to Angel Investigations, Mr...

08:15.569 --> 08:18.170
...Bleeshusengrung.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.589
Have a seat and an associate
will be right with you.

08:22.170 --> 08:25.189
- Lorne, non-human on deck.
- Coming.

08:31.769 --> 08:34.720
The guys with the face plates,
they're Nahdrahs.

08:35.370 --> 08:37.230
I speak their lingo, sort of.

08:37.169 --> 08:40.289
They have a job for our leader
and a lot of money.

08:41.370 --> 08:44.779
- Let's not keep them waiting.
- Our leader being Wesley.

08:44.970 --> 08:49.679
They saw his web articles on DNA
fusion comparisons in Tri-ped demons.

08:50.970 --> 08:53.289
Wesley, Wesley.
Talk to the Nahdrahs.

08:53.370 --> 08:56.879
- Office free? It's kind of personal.
- Yeah, go.

08:58.169 --> 09:01.429
This keeps up, we may
have to incorporate, huh?

09:02.370 --> 09:05.559
- We're getting stretched thin here.
- We can handle it.

09:05.970 --> 09:09.659
Really? Why don't you handle it by
picking up lines two, three and four?

09:11.970 --> 09:14.500
Angel Investigations.
Your problems are ours.

09:14.970 --> 09:17.110
Okay, how urgent is it?

09:17.970 --> 09:19.720
What do you do for a living?

09:19.769 --> 09:24.269
Good company. You own it?
Okay, hold on. Pen, paper, quick.

09:25.169 --> 09:28.470
I don't sleep. I'm afraid to go out
or answer the phone.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.029
I hate stalkers.
We'll put a stop to it. Have a seat.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.370
Thank you.

09:35.370 --> 09:40.529
- So do you know who this guy is?
- Yeah. It's Brian, my ex-boyfriend.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.399
- Have you been to the police?
- Yeah.

09:44.370 --> 09:48.059
They act like I'm some kind of nut.
Like I'm just making it up.

09:48.570 --> 09:51.269
The cops don't do a thing
till somebody's dead.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.039
- Somebody is dead.
- Who?

09:53.370 --> 09:58.110
Brian. Isn't that the kind
of stuff you guys deal with?

09:59.370 --> 10:02.740
All the time. So your dead boyfriend
is stalking you?

10:03.570 --> 10:06.830
Well, I mean,
he's not my boyfriend now.

10:07.169 --> 10:10.289
The article I'm currently
writing posits a formula...

10:10.769 --> 10:13.120
...for the genome mapping
of creatures without genes.

10:17.370 --> 10:18.700
It's an exciting arena.

10:19.169 --> 10:23.070
One we can download at I'll-never-
know-the-love-of-a-woman dot-com.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.850
Let's get to business.
They wanna buy your head.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.889
A little rusty with the lingo.
I should clarify that.

10:32.970 --> 10:35.990
They want your mind.
They're celebrating the prince's....

10:36.570 --> 10:39.870
It's like a birthday,
only they're disgorged, not born.

10:40.169 --> 10:44.169
They need you to solve a puzzle
so they can give it to him.

10:44.970 --> 10:47.669
- Could be interesting.
- They're puzzle people.

10:47.970 --> 10:50.389
Did you see their tunics?
Geometric shapes.

10:50.970 --> 10:53.500
Each a prime number,
if you count the edges...

10:53.970 --> 10:56.950
...arranged in order
of exponential accumulation.

10:57.570 --> 11:02.070
Yes, I did...not notice that at all.

11:05.970 --> 11:10.179
They wanna know why your girlfriend
was pointing. I better tell them.

11:10.769 --> 11:13.960
She's not my-- Silly.

11:17.370 --> 11:20.250
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, they liked you.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.830
So much they ran away?

11:23.370 --> 11:28.039
They either have to consult
with the prince or eat a monkey.

11:28.769 --> 11:30.490
Wes, I think I need you.

11:30.570 --> 11:32.600
Great. I'm on my way.

11:34.169 --> 11:37.539
- Big case. Gotta run. Here.
- Oh.

11:38.370 --> 11:41.039
He needs changing.
Oh, and a bottle, 3:00.

11:41.370 --> 11:42.559
Hi, there.

11:45.250 --> 11:48.059
Right. Yeah, okay.
That's good for us.

11:48.850 --> 11:53.169
Tell him a six-month million-dollar
guarantee, and we'll cover the cost.

11:53.649 --> 11:57.090
Yeah. No, I get that. But we
need a decision by tomorrow.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.480
Somebody walked into my office.
I'll call you.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.500
- Mr. Angel.
- Just Angel.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.669
Harlan Elster.
Thanks for meeting me.

12:06.250 --> 12:10.779
No problem. I know what it's like when
your name's on the letterhead and....

12:11.649 --> 12:14.809
- You're not exactly what I pictured.
- No?

12:15.250 --> 12:19.009
You're pretty well-coifed. You're not
afraid to get a little mussed, are you?

12:20.049 --> 12:22.789
That's what you'll be
just by going in there.

12:23.049 --> 12:25.649
- In where?
- 83rd and Vermont.

12:26.649 --> 12:30.759
Used to be low-income housing.
Now it's a nest.

12:31.450 --> 12:35.590
Boarded-up windows, no electricity,
sewer access. They like it dark.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.759
- Vampires.
- Whole gang.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.330
Those photos were taken
by the last guy.

12:41.049 --> 12:42.419
What happened to him?

12:42.850 --> 12:45.200
He got mussed.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.779
You have much experience
with vampires?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.970
- Some.
- Well, not like these.

12:50.649 --> 12:53.669
They're not out for blood.
They want money.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.480
- Money?
- Yeah, I know.

12:56.049 --> 12:59.240
Whoever heard of a vampire
out to make a buck, right?

13:01.450 --> 13:04.009
They're putting the squeeze
on businessmen.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.070
We pay them a protection fee,
and they don't eat our employees.

13:08.649 --> 13:11.389
- They're demanding $5000 by midnight.
- Wow.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.659
I'm prepared to pay you 10
to make this problem go away.

13:15.850 --> 13:20.629
Five thousand now.
Remainder when the job's finished.

13:21.850 --> 13:23.740
That would make 10.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.730
Which is more than
they're asking you for.

13:29.049 --> 13:32.279
- But this isn't about money.
- No, of course it's not...

13:33.250 --> 13:36.090
...about that, money.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.269
I'll get right on this.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.970
- Thanks.
- Sure.

13:50.649 --> 13:53.669
- What are you doing in my office?
- Mr. Elster.

14:15.649 --> 14:18.000
Decided to stick around.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.490
You asked me what I wanted from you.

14:24.049 --> 14:28.759
Go out and find others like you.
People who have suffered as we have.

14:30.049 --> 14:32.610
People with the same rage,
the same fire.

14:33.049 --> 14:37.860
You'll know them when you see them.
Their eyes will look like this feels.

14:45.649 --> 14:49.340
Are we clear? Have we learned
our lessons, Justine?

14:49.850 --> 14:51.919
We're clear.

14:57.649 --> 14:59.970
You son of a bitch.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.990
Is this country great, or what?
5000 smackaroos.

15:07.250 --> 15:10.549
All I have to do to get 5000 more
is clean out a vamp nest.

15:11.450 --> 15:13.340
- Where's Wes and Gunn?
- On a case.

15:13.850 --> 15:16.519
A young woman's dead boyfriend
is stalking her.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.519
- That's terrible. Did you--?
- I ran her credit.

15:19.850 --> 15:24.169
Nice. How's my little magna cum laude,
Notre Dame, class of 2020?

15:25.250 --> 15:30.240
I don't think it's a great idea to be
working on so many cases at once.

15:31.250 --> 15:36.059
What if we're out making money and
some poor devil comes in for our help?

15:36.649 --> 15:39.909
- Buon giorno, everybody!
- Have you been drinking?

15:40.850 --> 15:45.769
I can hold my liquor. Unfortunately
I can't say the same for fire water.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.179
- Aren't they the same?
- Hey, Fred.

15:48.649 --> 15:52.370
This is special fire water, used
to loosen up my Gar-wawk snitch.

15:53.450 --> 15:57.240
They light the water on fire and
a bong and look out, Houston!

15:57.649 --> 16:01.230
- You learn anything about Holtz?
- Yeah. He's not fond of you.

16:01.850 --> 16:05.850
I'm led to believe that he
and his Grapplers had plans to...you.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.440
- Is my breath stinky?
- Yeah.

16:09.049 --> 16:11.649
Holtz is using the Grapplers
as soldiers.

16:12.049 --> 16:16.259
No, he poisoned them, and he's
looking for human replacements.

16:16.850 --> 16:20.039
- We know where he is?
- I got rats looking all over town.

16:21.049 --> 16:24.139
Not real rats, except two of them.
I don't feel good.

16:24.649 --> 16:26.649
We've got company.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.100
Lorne? It's all
snap-crackle-pop to me.

16:31.850 --> 16:34.590
These are the guys that wanted Wesley.

16:37.850 --> 16:41.039
- Not anymore. Now they want Fred.
- For what?

16:43.850 --> 16:47.639
They think she can solve the puzzle
they wanna give to their prince.

16:48.049 --> 16:51.169
- They weren't offended, but impressed.
- Really?

16:51.649 --> 16:54.840
Where would she have to go
and how long would it take?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.879
They live on a barge
docked in the marina.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.970
And a day or two. Depends on
how long it takes her to solve it.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.519
- You game?
- Sure.

17:08.450 --> 17:11.049
You have to go.
Tell them it won't be cheap.

17:11.450 --> 17:15.240
They're getting two employees.
That's salary, per diem, overtime.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.858
Okay, okay.

17:21.049 --> 17:25.368
They apologize for the paltry offering
and hope you'll accept.... $50,000?!

17:26.450 --> 17:27.319
- Fifty...
- ...thousand...

17:27.650 --> 17:28.630
...dollars?

17:29.450 --> 17:31.309
We accept.

17:39.450 --> 17:43.380
I consider myself independent,
and it's hard to ask for help...

17:43.650 --> 17:46.140
...but it feels good
for you to be here.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.109
That woman's right.
You inspire confidence.

17:49.650 --> 17:53.299
- Which woman?
- Brunette. Really cute. Texan, maybe.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.779
- Fred.
- Fred.

17:56.849 --> 17:59.450
Said I inspire confidence.

17:59.849 --> 18:03.890
- The comment was directed at me.
- Really? Because I don't think so.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.880
Here, this is Brian.
Not exactly a rocket scientist.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.970
But he's so sweet.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.809
Ever meet somebody and know
you belong together? It feels--

18:14.250 --> 18:16.210
- Comfortable.
- Comfortable.

18:16.650 --> 18:20.230
- You read the same science journals.
- Laugh at the same jokes.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.940
And the sex.
Oh, God, do I miss the sex.

18:25.049 --> 18:26.559
Tell me about it.

18:26.849 --> 18:30.539
So explain this. How can Brian
be stalking me if he's dead?

18:31.049 --> 18:33.220
Witchcraft, black magic, voodoo...

18:33.450 --> 18:36.259
...zombification,
demon possession, vampirism.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.079
Why's he here?
What does he want?

18:39.450 --> 18:42.930
Perhaps he left something unfinished.
Something he wants to say.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.720
He may just want
to eat your intestines.

18:46.049 --> 18:49.700
We don't know that he's a zombie.
And the flesh-eating's a myth.

18:50.849 --> 18:54.470
Zombies mangle, mutilate
and occasionally wear human flesh.

18:55.049 --> 18:57.369
So there's no reason
to be frightened.

19:04.650 --> 19:06.900
Right, then. Zombie it is.

19:12.890 --> 19:13.940
Are you okay?

19:14.089 --> 19:16.720
I was seasick when
we were still on dry land.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.849
- Do I look greener than usual?
- A little.

19:25.490 --> 19:30.480
Nice décor. It's sort of a Jules Verne
meets Leona Helmsley.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.089
Come on.

19:35.690 --> 19:39.170
Oh, great.
They want to take our picture.

19:40.490 --> 19:42.589
Oh, terrific.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.430
This is the puzzle.

19:45.289 --> 19:48.269
I'm guessing it fits together in a sort
of algorismic sequence.

19:48.289 --> 19:50.750
Any hints?

19:52.490 --> 19:57.930
Just one. He said if they knew
how to do it, you wouldn't be here.

19:59.089 --> 20:03.369
So.... Causation corollary.

20:05.089 --> 20:07.119
Causatum corollary.

20:08.690 --> 20:13.470
Are we talking a closed curve
in a simply connected domain of zero?

20:14.089 --> 20:16.119
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?

20:16.490 --> 20:19.609
Oh, hors d'oeuvres. I couldn't.

20:20.089 --> 20:22.970
I had eyeballs and insects
for breakfast.

20:37.329 --> 20:41.259
Aren't we just the scary
serial vamps...

20:42.130 --> 20:44.869
...with the spooky lair?

20:46.930 --> 20:51.390
And the taking of the trophies
of our victims?

20:54.130 --> 20:55.640
Lame.

21:27.130 --> 21:30.779
Next time you hit the yard sales,
avoid the wooden furniture.

21:31.930 --> 21:33.650
I hear wicker's nice.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.789
Oh, great. Two more.

21:40.329 --> 21:42.400
Dibs on the coat.

21:46.329 --> 21:48.890
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

21:49.930 --> 21:54.069
- I'm looking for Harlan Elster.
- I'm Harlan Elster.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.549
- That's bad.
- How's it bad?

21:57.130 --> 22:02.259
Well, because the Harlan Elster
I'm looking for gave me this.

22:06.130 --> 22:11.289
Really? Well, he gave me this.
At least mine's real.

22:12.130 --> 22:15.390
The man who forged my name,
your height? Less beat up?

22:16.329 --> 22:17.450
Yeah, that's him.

22:17.529 --> 22:21.599
Sam Ryan. Used to work for me.
Fired him six months ago.

22:22.329 --> 22:24.789
He came to me to bankroll
his kooky scheme.

22:25.329 --> 22:28.519
- Kooky scheme?
- He's been off since his friend died.

22:29.529 --> 22:33.640
Wanted me to pay some ghostbuster
to clean out an abandoned rat-hole.

22:34.329 --> 22:37.519
He was convinced vampires
were nesting there.

22:37.930 --> 22:40.390
Some people would take advantage
of a guy like that.

22:40.930 --> 22:42.859
Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.329 --> 22:47.329
Immortals living in a rat-infested
building, guarding their treasure.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.920
Right.

22:50.529 --> 22:51.829
Treasure?

22:52.490 --> 22:57.299
There's an ascending and descending
causation instantly proved by...

22:57.890 --> 22:59.329
...that.

22:59.690 --> 23:01.509
I think I'm onto something here.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.599
Yeah, me too. Unfortunately
it requires a vomitorium.

23:06.289 --> 23:09.170
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.880
I'll just go use the facilities.
Keep up the good work.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.930
Thanks.

25:21.650 --> 25:27.230
Hm. Well, I figured it was a long shot.
But I really can float, you know.

25:27.650 --> 25:31.200
Well, I did at one time
during my last vision.

25:31.849 --> 25:35.009
Somebody needs a change.

25:36.049 --> 25:37.589
Before that, believe me...

25:37.849 --> 25:41.680
...there was no "floaty at peace
with my destiny" to the visions.

25:42.049 --> 25:45.140
There was just killer pain.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.670
Unfortunately,
that's not an exaggeration.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.900
They really were killing me.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.809
So The Powers That Be
put a little demon in me.

25:55.849 --> 25:58.410
And as far as side effects go...

25:58.849 --> 26:02.470
...the visions are a breeze now.

26:03.049 --> 26:05.890
I don't know
what else might be in store.

26:06.650 --> 26:10.369
I'm keeping an eye out
for horns and a tail.

26:10.849 --> 26:15.839
It just occurred to me what
a weird life you're in for, little guy.

26:16.849 --> 26:20.750
Your Aunt Cordy gets visions
and your daddy's a....

26:21.049 --> 26:23.650
Well, you won't see him
aging a whole lot...

26:24.650 --> 26:26.930
...or catching surf and sun in Malibu.

26:27.049 --> 26:31.859
But he is a good man, a champion,
and he loves you very much.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.539
Plus he's quite the natty dresser.

26:36.049 --> 26:39.950
And your daddy's out right now
fighting evil for money.

27:06.650 --> 27:09.910
- Give it back.
- I've earned it. Is it a Rolex?

27:10.849 --> 27:12.430
Timex.

27:12.650 --> 27:17.069
Considering the trouble you went
through, we know it's not just a watch.

27:18.049 --> 27:22.299
- That's true. It's not.
- Probably worth more than 10 grand.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.460
A lot more.

27:24.650 --> 27:27.740
What's it do? Open a portal?
Raise an army?

27:28.849 --> 27:33.170
It glows in the dark.
Probably about all it will do now.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.930
They cracked it
when they took it off him.

27:36.650 --> 27:40.440
I told him to let them have it,
but he wouldn't give it up.

27:40.849 --> 27:45.660
- It was the first thing I bought him.
- These vampires killed your friend.

27:46.849 --> 27:50.009
I'm sorry about what I did.
I didn't know what to do.

27:50.450 --> 27:53.400
- So you lied to me.
- I'm sorry.

27:54.049 --> 27:58.190
I didn't kill three vampires for
nothing. Ten grand, that was the deal.

27:58.849 --> 28:00.740
- Seven.
- Fine, I'll take seven.

28:01.250 --> 28:04.130
You said three vampires.
There were seven.

28:07.849 --> 28:11.009
- Which would make four more?
- Four more.

28:12.569 --> 28:16.359
You're gonna discover there's
a lot of cool things in this world.

28:17.009 --> 28:19.849
Fifty grand,
way up there on the list.

28:21.210 --> 28:25.069
We're just gonna lock this up
in the safe and--

28:25.849 --> 28:27.670
Right after this vision.

28:36.650 --> 28:40.299
Oh, God.
Fred, don't solve that puzzle.

28:42.049 --> 28:44.579
Shouldn't be long now.

28:47.650 --> 28:52.250
Do you know how much longer we'll be?
I've got plans this evening.

28:54.250 --> 28:57.019
We've taken every precaution,
secured every entrance--

28:59.049 --> 29:01.150
With the exception of the skylight.

29:01.450 --> 29:04.569
Allie! Allie, baby, I just--

29:08.049 --> 29:10.009
Into the bedroom!

29:20.650 --> 29:25.359
Well, your Uncle Wes and Uncle Gunn,
not picking up either.

29:26.650 --> 29:31.779
And your daddy, he doesn't know how
to work voice mail or keep a promise.

29:32.650 --> 29:36.690
So we'll go down to the marina,
return the money...

29:37.450 --> 29:40.500
...and explain it was all
a big mistake.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.490
Allie, why won't you talk to me?

29:45.849 --> 29:48.480
Because you're dead! Now, go away!

29:49.450 --> 29:53.140
I'm paying good money here.
Can you please get rid of him?

30:00.250 --> 30:02.529
Just give me another chance, baby.

30:02.650 --> 30:05.390
- Who are they?
- We're protecting her from you.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.230
Protection?
I thought you were dating them.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.099
This is exactly
why I broke up with you.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.480
You're suffocating me. Now, get lost!

30:27.849 --> 30:30.869
- What's he doing?
- Pouting.

30:31.450 --> 30:33.660
Okay, that's it.

30:36.250 --> 30:40.460
You know, this is so typical of you.
You're all bluster, then you pout.

30:41.049 --> 30:44.349
- I thought we had fun together.
- We did. But you're needy.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.619
Needy? Because I cared?

30:47.049 --> 30:49.650
Caring didn't entitle you to read
my diary, follow me....

30:50.049 --> 30:53.279
I never-- Okay, I read your diary.

30:53.650 --> 30:56.069
Does that give you any reason
to poison me?

30:57.849 --> 30:59.500
What?

31:00.849 --> 31:03.450
- You'll believe a zombie?
- She killed you?

31:03.849 --> 31:06.519
- I'd forgive her if she took me back.
- You're kidding.

31:06.849 --> 31:08.430
No.

31:09.250 --> 31:13.710
I've seen the guys you're going out
with, and you're not having any fun.

31:14.049 --> 31:17.420
Come on. Let's give it another shot.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.509
What do you say, baby? Me and you.

31:22.450 --> 31:27.089
- I can't. It's creepy.
- Come on. I miss you.

31:27.849 --> 31:32.980
Well, I don't know.
Maybe I was a little...

31:35.049 --> 31:37.009
...hasty.

31:45.849 --> 31:48.130
Will that be cash or charge?

31:48.849 --> 31:50.990
All right, you're kidding me, right?

31:51.250 --> 31:53.950
Sorry. I don't get paid,
I can't fight.

31:54.849 --> 31:58.750
- I can't hold this by myself.
- Yeah, I see that.

31:59.049 --> 32:01.150
- They're coming through.
- Okay.

32:02.049 --> 32:04.960
I'll help barricade it. But that's it.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.700
I'm sorry I lied to you.

32:09.849 --> 32:12.730
You did the wrong thing.
Your heart was in the right place.

32:13.450 --> 32:16.289
- Your motives were noble.
- Thank you.

32:17.049 --> 32:20.809
- I've been accused of nobility.
- Well, then you understand.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.730
Being a champion's not all
good deeds and happy endings.

32:25.450 --> 32:28.890
A lot goes on behind the scenes.
People don't consider that.

32:29.650 --> 32:32.809
- We got real trouble here.
- We can work something out.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.549
- Own a car?
- The bank owns it.

32:35.049 --> 32:36.839
- House?
- I rent.

32:37.450 --> 32:38.609
How's your credit?

32:38.650 --> 32:41.319
I spent everything I had
tracking these guys.

32:41.650 --> 32:45.859
I don't know what to say. I can't kill
on deferment. Sets a precedent.

32:56.049 --> 32:58.009
Oh, it was nothing.

32:58.450 --> 33:01.500
Are we going somewhere to celebrate?

33:02.650 --> 33:05.740
Say, has anyone seen
my friend with the horns?

33:06.250 --> 33:09.970
He wasn't feeling so good,
and I'm a little worried about him.

33:13.289 --> 33:15.220
And me, now.

33:15.289 --> 33:19.079
Yeah, I know.
We're in a bit of a situation here.

33:24.289 --> 33:26.710
Oh, God. I don't have
to marry him, do I?

33:27.289 --> 33:31.500
In fact, no. And that's something
we can be grateful for.

33:32.049 --> 33:33.519
What are they gonna do?

33:34.450 --> 33:38.420
The prince's head, or heads,
wear out every so often and they--

33:38.650 --> 33:40.299
Cut off someone else's
and give him a new one?

33:41.049 --> 33:42.029
Uh....

33:44.650 --> 33:46.650
Lorne, help! Help!

33:47.769 --> 33:51.069
Hey! I'd just like a word here.

33:53.849 --> 33:56.450
You guys are so gonna
get your butts kicked.

33:56.849 --> 33:57.859
- Lorne.
- Sorry.

33:58.049 --> 34:00.119
I yield
to the person not tied up.

34:00.450 --> 34:01.750
- Translate.
- Okay.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.779
There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

34:07.450 --> 34:11.630
And I know you're men of honor,
and I know we can make an exchange...

34:12.250 --> 34:14.460
...in a civilized manner.

34:20.050 --> 34:22.539
We return your gift,
and you return Fred.

34:23.050 --> 34:25.260
Sorry, but we need her head at work.

34:25.449 --> 34:29.139
- Firmly attached to her body.
- That goes without saying.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.329
Say it.

34:37.449 --> 34:41.210
I told them what they had to do
and what would happen if they didn't.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.670
We are in no position to threaten.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.130
Sure we are. Angel, Wes
and Gunn can take them.

34:48.849 --> 34:53.030
- Where are they, anyway?
- Out making money.

34:53.650 --> 34:58.710
So when I said they were surrounded
by warriors, I was stretching the truth?

35:00.250 --> 35:02.739
Just enough to get us all killed.

35:15.050 --> 35:17.469
What about the complimentary
barricading?

35:18.050 --> 35:20.960
It's gonna give.
I'm getting you out of here.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.829
- Let's go.
- No, you go.

35:26.449 --> 35:28.449
- What?
- I'm not leaving. I can't.

35:28.849 --> 35:31.730
- You can take four vampires alone?
- Probably not.

35:32.449 --> 35:35.710
But they killed Jack.
If I run now, I'll run forever.

35:36.650 --> 35:39.179
Do you think this is
what Jack would want?

35:39.650 --> 35:44.710
I think Jack would want to be here,
but that's never gonna happen.

35:49.849 --> 35:54.840
You take on a job in good faith,
you expect to be compensated.

35:55.250 --> 35:59.989
You provide the best service
you can offer. Quality service.

36:03.050 --> 36:07.329
But there's overhead, there's rent,
three phone lines, advertising.

36:07.849 --> 36:10.409
It adds up. Here.

36:10.849 --> 36:12.780
Thank you. I can't even
begin to express my....

36:15.650 --> 36:16.590
I owe you.

36:16.849 --> 36:20.010
- You're a real champion.
- Whatever. Hello?

36:20.449 --> 36:22.800
Hello? Hello?

36:23.449 --> 36:26.750
- I think that's your voice mail.
- Damn it.

36:30.650 --> 36:34.619
- Lorne, do these guys have groins?
- Is that important right now?

36:35.449 --> 36:37.309
- Work with me here.
- I think so.

36:37.849 --> 36:40.409
I never knew one intimately.

37:05.449 --> 37:07.269
Help! Help her!

37:07.849 --> 37:09.639
- Fred!
- Fred!

37:25.250 --> 37:28.800
Well, I guess you cut
off the snake's head....

37:30.050 --> 37:32.510
You piss the other snakes off.

37:53.769 --> 37:55.980
- I should have listened to you.
- Yeah.

37:56.170 --> 38:00.489
- I shouldn't have left you two alone.
- Well, yeah.

38:02.170 --> 38:06.139
If you can keep your head when those
about you lose theirs, you're lucky.

38:06.969 --> 38:09.139
I could kiss you both.

38:11.170 --> 38:13.449
Still tied up down here.

38:15.369 --> 38:18.630
- My hands are turning pink.
- Can I say something?

38:21.369 --> 38:24.559
Money's important,
but it isn't everything.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.099
I got carried away.

38:35.769 --> 38:39.840
I just never had a life that was
totally dependent on me before.

38:42.369 --> 38:45.039
But that's no excuse....

38:45.369 --> 38:48.210
- Where was I?
- Money's not the most important....

38:48.969 --> 38:53.469
No, it's not.
What's important is family...

38:57.969 --> 39:00.139
...and the mission.

39:03.969 --> 39:07.300
They tried to cut Fred's head off.
We earned every penny.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.199
- Hold the baby.
- Uh-huh.

39:11.170 --> 39:13.840
Spending money. All right!

39:24.969 --> 39:27.139
I'm just saying, a boat.

39:27.969 --> 39:31.130
No. College fund.

39:31.570 --> 39:36.239
Yes, college fund. And pay our bills.

39:37.570 --> 39:40.309
And put a down payment on a boat.

39:40.570 --> 39:43.030
I'm not getting a boat.

39:45.969 --> 39:48.179
They're fun.

39:49.570 --> 39:51.639
They're expensive.

39:51.969 --> 39:55.159
And when would I go on this boat?

39:55.570 --> 39:58.550
Moonlight sails.

40:01.570 --> 40:03.389
Okay.

40:07.570 --> 40:13.300
College fund, pay our bills
and rent a ski condo in Aspen.

40:14.769 --> 40:16.139
Ski condo?

40:15.969 --> 40:18.949
There's gotta be some fun
in our lives.

40:21.969 --> 40:24.599
I like a ski condo.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.690
Sure.

40:26.769 --> 40:29.960
Snow.... Trees....

40:30.969 --> 40:34.300
Chipmunk robots on ice....

40:39.369 --> 40:43.059
Chipmunk robots on ice.

40:44.305 --> 40:50.288
