01:26.620 --> 01:28.055
Come on.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
Yeah, okay.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.618
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:57.651 --> 02:00.354
-Yeah.
-She's beautiful.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.524
Look at these colors

Dad, come on.

-No, uh, you go.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.701
-She's so soft.
-Yeah.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.874
Can we take her home?

02:20.908 --> 02:23.744
I don't think
she'll fit in the car, love.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.814
(chuckles)

02:31.919 --> 02:33.287
Put that down.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.323
(chuckles)

02:36.324 --> 02:38.326
(birds singing)

02:47.235 --> 02:49.570
Dad, look.
It's unicorn poo.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.605
Dirty.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.376
All right,
better get going, love.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.010
-So...
-But I want to stay.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.546
Yeah, I know, but we'll...

02:58.579 --> 03:00.848
-we'll come back
another day, all right?
-Okay.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.718
Bye.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.087
(whispering):
I will never forget you.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.492
Let's go, eh?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.926
-(grunts)
-Look.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.428
-Oh, that's cool.
-Wow.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.397
-Beauty.
-ALLY: You want a hand?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.432
Yeah.
(grunting softly)

03:22.603 --> 03:25.373
-Just watch it...
-I'm okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.141
-You got it?
-Yeah.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.557
(leaves rustling)

03:44.758 --> 03:47.094
(soft clattering)

03:47.127 --> 03:49.129
(clicks tongue)

03:51.632 --> 03:53.734
(whispering):
Hey.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.438
Hey.
(clicks tongue)

03:57.471 --> 03:59.973
Good girl. Good girl.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.976
Yeah, good girl. Good girl.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.078
You want
to get this horn off, eh?

04:05.112 --> 04:07.047
Let me. Come on.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.116
There you go.
There you go.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.452
-(groans)
-(whinnies)

04:11.485 --> 04:14.254
Oh. Fuck.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.029
(doorbell plays a tune)

04:29.169 --> 04:30.571
How ya going?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.573
Can we have a word outside?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.508
Sure.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.677
(Ray hums a tune)

04:40.681 --> 04:42.583
What's up?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.185
Brit said you had
the sex talk with her?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.588
Yup.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.590
Look, I'm not having a go
at you, but don't you think

04:49.623 --> 04:51.359
it's important that
if you're gonna have those kind

04:51.392 --> 04:54.261
of conversations with her, you
at least flag it with me first?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.996
Well, I couldn't
flag it with you

04:56.029 --> 04:58.332
'cause she caught us
having sex.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.334
Oh.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.336
Where were you having sex?

05:02.370 --> 05:04.104
-Does it matter?
-No,

05:04.137 --> 05:05.439
-just...
-What, do you think
we're having sex

05:05.473 --> 05:07.207
-in front of her or something?
-No.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.109
-I just... It's just...
-(door opens)

05:09.142 --> 05:10.444
BRITTANY:
Hi.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.513
-Hello.
-Are we going bowling?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.282
Are we going bowling?
Um...

05:15.315 --> 05:18.519
I don't know. I don't know if
I'm allowed to take you bowling.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.521
-You better ask your mum.
-Mum, can we go bowling?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.189
Of course
you can go bowling, sweetie.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.425
-Cool.
-Awesome.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.165
(grunts)

05:32.199 --> 05:33.300
Nice. Nice.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.902
BRITTANY:
Oh, no.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.470
RAY:
Still got a fair shake.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.806
-I'm gonna win still.
-No, you're not.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.508
-Yes, I am.
-No, I got a key in there.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.975
No, I'm gonna win.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.944
No, I'm gonna start.
I'm gonna focus now.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.552
* Tonight... *

05:51.585 --> 05:53.353
No!

05:53.387 --> 05:56.223
Now you have... 40 points.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.592
40. I'm catching up.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.628
(indistinct conversations)

06:10.571 --> 06:12.573
-(kids chattering)
-It's fucked.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.910
I spent an hour this morning
going from place to place,

06:16.944 --> 06:19.947
just trying
to find a normal breakfast.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.182
What happened
to bacon and eggs on toast?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.851
-Mm.
-Spin me.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.252
And now it's all fuckin'

06:25.285 --> 06:28.221
smashed avo on a brioche
of quail eggs

06:28.255 --> 06:30.357
served up by some Pilate...

06:30.390 --> 06:32.292
weekend Pilates instructor

06:32.325 --> 06:34.094
man-bun ponce named Tristan
who wants

06:34.127 --> 06:37.297
-to give you a lecture
about fuckin' gluten-free and...
-MADDY: Faster, faster!

06:37.330 --> 06:39.567
-I gave up, man.
-Mm.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.802
So you're living
in Bondi now, eh?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.037
No, I just brought Maddy over
to the beach.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.906
I'm in Maroubra.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.307
On your own?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.244
Me and Zoey split up.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.814
When did this happen?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.049
-Early March.
-Thanks for telling me.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.818
(short chuckle)

06:57.851 --> 07:00.120
You don't want to hear
about that shit, mate.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.390
So, you working?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.893
MADDY:
Brittany!

07:05.926 --> 07:08.428
-Do you want me to spin you?
-How come?

07:08.462 --> 07:11.131
What am I gonna do?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.566
You got to do something, man.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.568
Can I have a drink, Dad?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.937
-Sure, Mads. What do you want?
-Lemonade.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.940
Lemonade?
What do you say?

07:19.973 --> 07:22.142
Please?

07:22.175 --> 07:25.479
Please, Dad,
'cause you are the best daddy

07:25.513 --> 07:26.914
in the universe.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.349
Please, Dad,
because you are the best dad

07:29.382 --> 07:30.784
in the universe.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.520
-Huh?
-Well-trained. Well done. Mm.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.656
Brittany!
Other way.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.168
(toilet flushing)

08:02.149 --> 08:03.784
-What?
-What's that smell?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.185
What smell?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.354
-The cigarette smell.
-Don't know.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.624
Must be one of the neighbors.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.059
Mum says you smoke.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.527
Yeah, I used to smoke.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.195
But not anymore?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.597
Mm-mmm.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.366
Pinky swear?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.469
I'm not gonna pinky swear.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.271
Look, I s...
You know...

08:26.273 --> 08:29.309
-I have one occasionally,
all right?
-Why did you lie?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.211
'Cause I don't want you knowing
that I smoke.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.547
-Why?
-'Cause I don't want you
thinking it's okay to smoke,

08:33.581 --> 08:35.315
and then, one day,
you start smoking.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.050
No way. Smoking's bad for you.
It gives you cancer.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.253
-I'm not stupid.
-Yeah, well, I didn't say
you were stupid.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.556
Well, I don't want you
to get cancer.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.391
Well, I don't want
to get cancer, either.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.693
-Then why don't you stop, then?
-'Cause it's not

08:45.726 --> 08:47.094
bloody easy to quit.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.528
It's...

08:48.562 --> 08:49.763
addictive.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.665
Why?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.534
Well, you got this... there's
this stuff called nicotine.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.936
Now, that's a chemical,
all right?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.071
And that's in
the cigarettes, right?

08:58.105 --> 09:01.108
So when you smoke it, you get
used to getting that nicotine.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.276
So when you stop,
the receptors in your brain

09:03.310 --> 09:05.846
don't get the nicotine anymore,
and they start screaming out,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.380
and it makes you go crazy.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.382
Well, will you stop for me?

09:09.416 --> 09:10.818
-(sighs)
-Please?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.090
All right.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.191
Promise?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.426
Look,

09:19.459 --> 09:22.429
I promise you
I'll try to quit, okay?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.765
I can't guarantee 100%
that I can do it,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.066
but I'll try, okay?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.736
Well, you need to try
really, really hard.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.804
Okay. I promise

09:30.838 --> 09:33.106
I'll try really hard, okay?

09:33.140 --> 09:35.242
-Okay.
-Ah.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.144
Happy now?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.613
-Yes.
-Good.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.314
Clean your room up?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.583
-No, it's Christmas.
-You don't clean your room up,

09:43.617 --> 09:45.753
-Santa won't give you
any presents.
-You told me

09:45.786 --> 09:47.487
-Santa's not real.
-Yeah, well, I won't give you

09:47.520 --> 09:49.122
any presents if you don't
clean your bloody room.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.124
-How does that sound?
-(sighs) Fine.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.526
Mm-hmm.
Bye-bye.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.032
BRUCE:
No, no. That one.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.135
Yeah.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.907
Who's that from, Britt?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.677
-From Uncle Bruce.
-Okay.
-Mm.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.316
Oh, cool. Thanks.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.318
Is that all right?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.754
Yeah, it's great.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.791
You're welcome, beautiful.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.493
Do you want your present now?

10:26.526 --> 10:28.495
-You got me a present?
-Mm-hmm.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.530
Sure.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.502
Are you ready?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.204
-Yeah.
-Tell Uncle Bruce

10:37.237 --> 10:38.839
what your present is, Britt.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.708
Oh. Um, I wrote you some jokes.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.509
You wrote some jokes?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.177
-Mm-hmm.
-Tell him what you want to be

10:44.211 --> 10:45.779
-when you grow up.
-A stand-up comedian.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.448
A stand-up comedian?
Wow.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.950
When did this happen?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.452
Oh, this is just what she wants
to be this week, mate.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.621
It'll, uh...
it'll change next week.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.856
BRUCE:
All right.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.190
RAY:
Go for it, Britt.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.192
What's brown and sticky?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.361
I don't know. What?

11:01.394 --> 11:02.662
A stick.

11:02.696 --> 11:03.663
Oh.
(chuckles)

11:03.697 --> 11:04.832
Oh. Very good.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.801
Why did the chicken
cross the road?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.503
I don't know. Why did
the chicken cross the road?

11:10.537 --> 11:13.640
Why are you asking me?
I asked you.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.642
Eh?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.810
Don't look at me, man.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.712
(both laugh)

11:18.746 --> 11:20.213
Very good.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.382
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.151
Interrupting cow.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.352
Interrup...

11:25.385 --> 11:27.420
-Moo.
-Ah.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.589
-You got me. Very good.
-(chuckles)

11:29.622 --> 11:32.025
-Very good. Bravo.
-Okay.
-(clapping)

11:32.059 --> 11:34.627
Very...
Thank you, beautiful.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.397
Mm.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.232
What'd you get me, man?

11:39.266 --> 11:40.367
-You?
-Mm.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.035
Oh...

11:43.570 --> 11:46.039
Here we go.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.674
Oh, you got me one of those.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.009
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.543
Oh, I got you...
I-I got you something,

11:50.577 --> 11:51.779
but I got you two of 'em.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.280
-Oh. Thank you.
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.783
(both chuckle)

11:55.816 --> 11:57.417
Is that for Ally?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.852
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

11:58.886 --> 12:00.253
What did you get her?

12:00.287 --> 12:02.022
I made her a necklace.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.424
-You made it?
-Yeah.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.593
She will love that.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.196
-Um, you got all your stuff?
-Mm-hmm.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.431
-Hey, mate, you sure
you don't want to come?
-No, mate.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.599
I'm good.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.601
What are you gonna do?

12:14.634 --> 12:16.536
Television.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.371
All right.
Okay.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.140
-Come on, boogaloo.
-Bye.
-Bye.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.608
You look beautiful.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.609
-Thanks, mate.
-Thanks.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.611
-Not you.
-Oh.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.446
Merry Christmas!

12:26.479 --> 12:28.715
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, mate.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.751
-See you in a bit.
-Yeah.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.787
(door closes)

12:40.961 --> 12:42.762
RAY:
32.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.965
Ah.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.266
(clears throat softly)

12:47.968 --> 12:49.502
Want to ring that bell, love?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.240
Nice house, huh?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.408
Eh?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.310
Hi!
Merry Christmas.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.312
Hi, darling.
Oh.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.248
Oh!
You didn't have to do that.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.283
Thank you.
Come in, come in, come in.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.685
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

13:05.718 --> 13:09.356
(indistinct chatter)

13:09.389 --> 13:10.958
-So, that... Oh.
-(door closes)

13:10.991 --> 13:12.592
Here we go.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.761
-What's your mum's name again?
-Sally.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.762
(exhales)

13:15.795 --> 13:17.764
-Hello.
-Hi.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.166
-Merry Christmas.
-Mum, this is Brittany.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.834
-This is Ray.
-How you doing?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.435
-How you doing, Ray?
-Um... Oh, here.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.770
-Hang on.
-Merry Christmas. Welcome.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.873
Merry Chr... Yeah,
merry Christmas to you, too.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.474
-Nice house.
-Oh.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.109
-Thank you very much.
-Sure. Yeah.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.011
-Did you want
a sparkling apple juice?
-Yes, please.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.312
Yes. And can I open this now,
please?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.313
-Yes.
-You sure?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.314
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.
-Would you like a beer?

13:34.347 --> 13:35.648
-Wine?
-Yeah. Yeah, that'd
be great, yeah.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.783
Come on outside.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.151
-Okay. Cool.
-Yeah.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.887
SALLY:
This is where
it's all happening.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.655
TOM:
So, what do you get
if you cross a skeleton

13:42.689 --> 13:44.491
with a famous detective?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.059
TRENT:
What, Dad?

13:46.093 --> 13:48.028
Sherlock Bones.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.164
-Oh, come on. No.
-(laughs)

13:51.198 --> 13:52.832
-ALISHA:
I liked the sausage one better.
-TRENT: Here you go, Mum.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.402
-(conversation continuing)
-SALLY: Thanks, love.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.004
-(Tom laughs)
-ALLY: Terrible. I'm sorry.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.006
-TROY: Genius. Genius.
-TOM: That is a cracker.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.674
(quietly):
Are you okay?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.076
I need a smoke.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.912
-Well, go have one.
-Can't.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.480
Promised Britt I'd give up.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.550
On Christmas Day?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.919
Jesus H.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.153
-Mm.
-Mm.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.254
Okay. Good.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.522
TOM:
Hey, Ray,

14:15.555 --> 14:17.157
ever played Secret Santa before?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.892
-No, mate.
-Oh, mate,

14:18.926 --> 14:21.328
you are in for the time
of your life.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.064
Okay, the way it works:
there's 12 of us in here--

14:24.097 --> 14:25.732
there's all
the little cards in here

14:25.765 --> 14:27.667
-with numbers on 'em, one to 12.
-TRENT: We all know how to play,
Dad.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.202
Everybody takes a number.
Come on, Troy.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.172
-Come on in, mate.
You grab a number there.
-Oh, sorry, Pop.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.406
Okay, now, what's gonna
happen is that

14:33.440 --> 14:34.908
whoever draws number one,

14:34.942 --> 14:37.911
-they get to go up there first.
There you go, T-Roy.
-Thanks, Pops.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.679
Number two, they follow 'em up

14:39.712 --> 14:41.348
and they get to pick
a present as well.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.250
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.085
If they don't like
their present,

14:45.118 --> 14:46.920
-they can swap it
with number one.
-Yeah.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.621
-(laughs)
-Which means number 12

14:48.655 --> 14:51.724
is the best place to be, okay?
Because you get to pick

14:51.758 --> 14:53.793
-from all the other presents
at the end.
-RAY: Okay.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.428
And here's me.
I got number four.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.597
-Who's number one?
-Aw, that's m...
I have it again.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.232
Same as last year.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.468
-Every year. Loser.
-(indistinct chatter)

15:01.501 --> 15:03.136
Oh, Dad! Okay.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.138
-Can I check
what they all-all are?
-ALISHA: Just-just--

15:05.172 --> 15:07.140
-Don't shake too hard.
Some are breakable.
-TROY: Biscuits.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.142
-Can I... (laughs)
-Biscuits.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.144
-TRENT: Come on, sis.
-ALLY: All right,
I'll go for the thin one. Okay.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.413
-TOM: Fish bowl, for sure.
-ALISHA: I'm guessing a book.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.815
What have we got? We've got...

15:15.848 --> 15:19.252
-Ah. How to Insult People
in 50 Languages.
-What is it?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.154
-How useful.
-TOM: Oh, that's perfect
for you, love.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.557
-(laughter)
-* Have yourself *

15:24.591 --> 15:28.928
-* A merry little Christmas... *
-A lightsaber. (whooshing)

15:28.962 --> 15:30.998
ALISHA:
What do you want to do, Zo--
do you want to swap it?

15:31.031 --> 15:32.932
-* Let your heart be light *
-TOM: No! No, I don't want to...

15:32.966 --> 15:35.635
Aw!

15:35.668 --> 15:37.437
Not just one-- two!

15:37.470 --> 15:41.141
-* From now on *
-Block your eyes,
block your eyes.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.843
-* Our troubles will be out... *
-What is that? Oh.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.913
-TOM: You got a good one?
-Yeah.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.248
TROY:
Oh!

15:48.281 --> 15:50.017
Oh!

15:50.050 --> 15:52.119
She-Ra!

15:52.152 --> 15:55.955
-No, that's special.
-* Have yourself *

15:55.989 --> 15:58.258
-* A merry little *
-Merry Christmas.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.993
-Ooh!
-* Christmas... *

16:00.027 --> 16:01.995
Dinos.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.432
Dino molds. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, yeah.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.535
-I'm gonna have to swap.
Sorry. Sorry.
-Oh!

16:08.568 --> 16:10.770
* From now on *

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
-* Our troubles *
-TOM: Oh, that's
a beautiful present.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.307
-* Will be miles away... *
-Good on ya, mate.

16:14.341 --> 16:18.178
And lucky last, number 12...

16:18.211 --> 16:20.147
is Trent.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.482
-Come on up here, son.
-ALLY: You're the worst.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.684
-TOM: Come on.
-Sounds broken.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.354
Is that the--
is that the "shake gently" one?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.189
-That's the "shake gently" one.
-That's-that's...

16:29.222 --> 16:31.324
TROY:
Bet you it's teacups.
I bet you it's teacups.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.559
(Trent grunts)

16:32.592 --> 16:33.826
TROY:
Yeah, bet you it's teacups.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.528
* Of yore... *

16:35.562 --> 16:37.864
-Ah, see, I told you.
-ALLY: Ah, the couple together.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.567
See, they even look like the two
of you. That's perfect.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.202
TRENT:
Thanks, sis.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.870
-TOM: Dino mold.
You'll love that.
-ALISHA: Take these.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.705
-Well, Dad,
those-those do look good.
-(chatter continuing)

16:45.738 --> 16:47.874
-TROY:
He's going for the headphones.
-ALISHA: You want... Take these.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.542
But I think I like
what's in the box.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.544
-Oh, you're not.
-SALLY: Trent.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.813
-TOM: Trent.
-Come on.
-ALISHA: Oh, my God.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.882
-What is wrong with him?
She's just a little kid.
-TRENT: What?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.551
-Hey, it's the rules.
-She's a kid, man. Dude.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.353
-Really?
-ISABELLE: I want the unicorn.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.489
TROY:
What are you gonna do
with a unicorn?

17:02.522 --> 17:05.024
-I don't know yet.
-TOM: All right, everybody.

17:05.058 --> 17:08.027
(chuckles)
Let's, um... l-let's, uh,

17:08.061 --> 17:09.662
-clean the place up,
pick up all the papers.
-All right.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.898
-Then we'll go and have a drink
outside. What do you say?
-(indistinct chatter)

17:11.931 --> 17:14.601
-MIA: Merry Christmas!
-ALISHA: Merry Christmas!
Grab a bag,

17:14.634 --> 17:16.002
-and we'll put it all in here.
-ROB: Merry Christmas.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.404
TOM: Good on ya, Robbie.
-ALISHA: Rob, have you been
chewing yours?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.415
How's it going, dude?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.183
Yeah, good.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.584
Smoke?

17:31.618 --> 17:33.253
Nah, I gave up.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.587
Yeah, I should.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.956
Yeah, you should.
(sniffs)

17:36.989 --> 17:39.592
Hey, you know that, uh...
that unicorn candle?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.595
-Yeah, it's pretty cool,
isn't it?
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.964
Is there any chance
you can give it back?

17:45.998 --> 17:46.966
Why?

17:46.999 --> 17:48.868
Well, me daughter, she's...

17:48.901 --> 17:51.804
kind of obsessed with unicorns
at the moment.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.374
-Yeah.
-And, uh, you know,

17:54.407 --> 17:56.109
I was hoping maybe, you know,
you can give it back

17:56.143 --> 17:58.545
and, you know, I'll, uh,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.247
throw you 100 bucks
or something.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.249
You trying to bribe me
to give your daughter

18:02.282 --> 18:04.917
-the unicorn candle?
-I wouldn't say I'm bribing you.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.319
More like I'm...

18:06.353 --> 18:08.655
asking you a favor, you know?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.657
And if you can do it...

18:10.690 --> 18:12.425
I'll show a bit of gratitude

18:12.459 --> 18:14.060
and throw you some cash.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.928
Do I look like I need the money?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.732
I don't think you look
like you need the money.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.335
You know how much I make
in a year?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.803
Why-why are you
being a dickhead?

18:23.836 --> 18:26.939
(scoffs) Yeah, I think one of us
is being a dickhead.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.518
Why the fuck
would you take a present

18:38.551 --> 18:41.454
off a little kid?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.990
You're a grown man.
What the fuck do you want

18:44.023 --> 18:46.526
with a fuckin' girly candle?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.861
Eh, 'cause it's kitchy.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.130
It's kitchy?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.032
Yeah. Kitchy.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.501
Aha.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.902
(short chuckle)

18:59.038 --> 19:01.608
* Hail the new year,
lads and lasses *

19:01.641 --> 19:03.976
* Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la *

19:04.010 --> 19:06.613
* Sing we joyous, all together *

19:06.646 --> 19:09.349
* Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la *

19:09.382 --> 19:11.284
* Heedless of the wind
and weather... *

19:11.318 --> 19:13.353
-Trent, just... I know.
-Mum?
-Careful, Mum, careful.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.887
Okay.
Dad, can you get a t...

19:18.891 --> 19:20.327
BRITTANY:
Hey, Dad?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.196
What happened
with Ally's brother?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.398
I think he tripped over or...

19:25.432 --> 19:28.134
he had a bit much to drink.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.669
So he was drunk?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.070
Yeah, I think so.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.573
How come you took
the candle off him?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.008
Oh, he didn't
really want it, so...

19:36.042 --> 19:38.645
Should I give him
my present, then?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.214
No, you keep it.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.722
All right, love.
Kiss, kiss.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.990
Mwah.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.059
All right.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.664
-See you.
-Bye.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.065
(door closes)

20:00.600 --> 20:02.168
-JACINTA: Hey.
-Hi.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.537
-How was it?
-Good.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.573
-You have fun?
-Yeah.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.277
(engine starts)

20:29.161 --> 20:30.963
(knocking)

20:50.783 --> 20:53.420
(dishes clacking)

21:08.535 --> 21:10.970
-(deep breath)
-I'm sorry.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.306
(chuckles):
Yeah.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.009
RAY:
I'm not making excuses, but...

21:17.043 --> 21:19.178
Britt caught me smoking
this morning,

21:19.211 --> 21:20.947
and, um, she made me promise

21:20.980 --> 21:23.783
to give up, and I
hadn't smoked all day, and...

21:24.984 --> 21:26.486
You know?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.188
Fair enough.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.860
You okay?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.329
No.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.564
Yeah.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.767
Fair enough.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.102
What about your bro?
How's...

21:43.135 --> 21:44.504
Is he all right?

21:45.538 --> 21:47.239
How do you think?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.410
Mm.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.549
(exhales)

22:03.322 --> 22:06.426
So, you know that guy
that I was engaged to, yeah?

22:07.494 --> 22:09.696
I ended that.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.064
We were together for...

22:12.098 --> 22:14.166
uh, three years.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.572
He had demons, like you.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.142
He used to lash out
and smash things

22:23.175 --> 22:26.178
and punch walls.

22:26.212 --> 22:29.582
And then one day
he started on me.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.085
Then he apologized
and told me that he loved me,

22:33.119 --> 22:36.288
and... I forgave him.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.695
And then a few weeks later,
he, um...

22:42.729 --> 22:44.397
slapped me.

22:44.431 --> 22:47.033
After that, he kicked me,
punched me...

22:48.901 --> 22:51.738
And every time, you know,
he'd say, uh...

22:51.771 --> 22:54.541
"I'm sorry."

22:54.574 --> 22:56.375
And told me that he loved me.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.111
"I'm sorry."

23:01.414 --> 23:03.382
And he's-he's not a bad person.
I used to tell myself that

23:03.416 --> 23:05.084
all the time.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.286
He's just...
He's damaged, and...

23:08.921 --> 23:10.790
I thought that I could save him.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.360
(short chuckle)
And I tried, I really...

23:14.393 --> 23:16.729
I really tried.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.567
-But I couldn't.
-Mm.

23:30.309 --> 23:32.178
There's a darkness in you.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.748
And I think
that's one of the things

23:35.782 --> 23:37.950
that attracted me to you
in the first place.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.886
But now I think...

23:39.919 --> 23:41.921
I don't know, I think that...

23:43.656 --> 23:45.825
...the very thing
I loved about you--

23:45.858 --> 23:47.359
now it scares me.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.004
I'll never hit you.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.508
That's what he used to say.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.779
-And I can't take that chance.
-Mm.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.815
I can't.
I'm sorry.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.825
So that's it?

24:23.329 --> 24:25.798
Yeah.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.005
I'm sorry.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.042
So am I.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.681
I love you.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.016
I do.
Know that.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.888
And walking away
from someone that you love

24:48.921 --> 24:52.659
is one of the hardest fucking
things in the world to do.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.128
Yeah.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.363
(sniffs)

25:01.734 --> 25:03.536
Well...

25:03.570 --> 25:04.737
(sniffs)

25:14.246 --> 25:16.716
Yeah.
All right.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.891
Look after yourself.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.197
You too.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.407

25:41.440 --> 25:43.442

26:17.509 --> 26:21.413

26:21.447 --> 26:24.216

26:24.250 --> 26:25.584
* This time *

26:27.319 --> 26:30.422

26:34.093 --> 26:36.095
* The way that it is *

26:36.128 --> 26:38.097
* In my mind *

26:43.970 --> 26:46.338
* Someday *

26:46.372 --> 26:49.809
* I'll get over you *

26:49.842 --> 26:53.112
* I'll live *

26:53.145 --> 26:56.082
* To see it all through *

26:56.115 --> 26:59.585
* But I'll always miss *

26:59.618 --> 27:01.587
* Dreaming my dreams *

27:01.620 --> 27:03.555
* With you. *
