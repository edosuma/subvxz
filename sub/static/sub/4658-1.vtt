03:26.600 --> 03:29.280
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.480
Did you know him well?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.280
I knew him.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.160
Well, nil nisi bonum.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.280
But did he really deserve...

03:39.480 --> 03:41.680
...a place in here?

03:55.960 --> 03:58.760
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

03:59.040 --> 04:00.920
What, more words?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.480
The revolt in the desert...

04:04.680 --> 04:08.160
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.040
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.480
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.440
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.320
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.040
And to make him known to the world.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.520
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.760
Thank you.

04:32.960 --> 04:37.440
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.520
You, sir. Who are you?

04:39.760 --> 04:41.880
My name is Jackson Bentley.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.120
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.480
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

04:48.760 --> 04:50.680
No, I can't claim to have known him.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.280
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.040
Knew him? I never knew him.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.600
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.040
Michael George Hartley...

05:19.320 --> 05:22.480
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.680
That's right.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.080
We are not happy in it.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.960
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.480
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.440
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.080
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.080
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

05:47.560 --> 05:49.720
- Is it there?
- Of course.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.480
Headlines.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.040
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.880
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

06:00.760 --> 06:04.320
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.080
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.480
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.880
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.800
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.680
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.680
And you're balmy!

06:43.240 --> 06:46.080
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.040
What's the trick, then?

06:48.280 --> 06:52.160
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.240
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

06:55.520 --> 06:58.680
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.440
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.600
Lawrence.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.520
Yes?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.480
You're supposed to be...

07:13.840 --> 07:16.160
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

07:17.000 --> 07:17.960
Always.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.320
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.880
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.920
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.480
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.080
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.680
Where are you going?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.280
I must say, Lawrence!

07:37.480 --> 07:40.200
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.680
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
Sorry.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.880
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.200
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

07:53.440 --> 07:56.800
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.160
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.640
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.280
There is, indeed.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.400
He's of no use here in Cairo.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.560
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.280
Knows the books, you mean.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.480
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.360
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.080
Well, what more do you want?

08:22.280 --> 08:25.280
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

08:25.480 --> 08:27.320
...giving military advice.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.400
By God, I should hope not.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.960
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

08:34.120 --> 08:35.200
To what?

08:35.440 --> 08:37.799
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.919
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

08:42.159 --> 08:44.800
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.320
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.320
They did attack Medina.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.800
And the Turks made mincemeat
of them.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.280
We don't know that.

08:54.680 --> 08:58.840
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.320
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.760
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.720
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.280
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

09:12.480 --> 09:15.000
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.760
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.000
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

09:22.240 --> 09:26.520
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

09:26.760 --> 09:31.480
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.240
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.040
Good morning, sir.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.680
Salute.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.000
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.920
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.880
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.960
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.080
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.560
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.360
Why, I can't imagine.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.920
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.880
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

10:12.040 --> 10:14.200
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.880
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.280
It says so in your dossier.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.440
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.680
But I suppose I could be wrong.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.920
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.480
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

10:38.360 --> 10:39.680
Yes, what is it?

10:39.880 --> 10:42.520
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.640
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.800
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.680
But there must be artillery!

10:53.320 --> 10:56.680
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.960
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.680
He can't do that in six weeks.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.880
- Two months, then.
- Three.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.240
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.080
Thank you, sir.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.680
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.680
Shut up and get out.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.880
Sir?

11:33.280 --> 11:36.400
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

11:37.360 --> 11:41.120
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.680
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.720
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

11:47.960 --> 11:49.600
Find Prince Feisal.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.560
Good. And when I've found him?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.680
Find out what kind of a man he is.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.480
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.080
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.440
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.040
That's new.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.880
Where are they now?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.840
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.520
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.240
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.400
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.640
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

12:28.920 --> 12:32.280
Bedouins and gods,
and you're neither. Take it from me.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.680
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.480
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.280
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.880
Here you may drink.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.680
One cup.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.680
You do not drink?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.280
No.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.240
I'll drink when you do.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.160
I am Bedu.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.680
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

16:20.960 --> 16:22.280
Yes.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.480
From Cairo?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.280
Yes.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.880
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.880
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.840
And before?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.880
From Britain?

16:39.160 --> 16:40.480
Yes.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.080
Truly?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.920
From Oxfordshire.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.280
Is that a desert country?

16:49.240 --> 16:53.400
No. A fat country. Fat people.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.080
You are not fat?

16:56.760 --> 16:57.880
No.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.880
I'm different.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.080
Here...

17:29.800 --> 17:31.240
...take it.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.400
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.080
Take it now.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.480
Bedu food.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.480
Good.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.880
More?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.880
- Bedu.
- Where?

19:22.960 --> 19:25.440
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.880
Yes, I know.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.920
- I am not Harith.
- No.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.680
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.720
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.480
When you are ready to go...

20:11.720 --> 20:14.680
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

20:31.600 --> 20:35.080
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.840
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.520
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

20:58.760 --> 20:59.840
Now!

21:57.440 --> 21:58.680
Good?

21:58.920 --> 22:00.640
It's all right.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.840
This is a Harith well.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.680
The Harith are a dirty people.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.280
Turks?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.760
Bedu.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.040
Who is he?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.080
He is dead.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.880
Yes.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.160
Why?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.280
This is my well.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.360
I have drunk from it.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.000
You are welcome.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.920
He was my friend.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.880
- That?
- Yes, that.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.640
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.880
His?

26:22.480 --> 26:23.680
Mine.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.080
Then I will use it.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.800
Your friend...

26:37.760 --> 26:39.840
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.480
I know.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.920
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.440
I have heard of you.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.640
So...

26:58.920 --> 27:00.680
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

27:00.960 --> 27:04.280
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

27:04.760 --> 27:08.080
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.880
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.080
I can both read and write.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.480
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.480
What is your name?

27:25.360 --> 27:27.840
My name is for my friends.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.080
None of my friends is a murderer.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.880
You are angry, English.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.080
He was nothing.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.040
The well is everything.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.880
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.640
He knew that.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.040
Salaam.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.160
Sherif Ali.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.440
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

28:06.720 --> 28:09.120
...so long will they be
a little people...

28:09.320 --> 28:10.680
...a silly people.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.200
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Come.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.280
I will take you to Feisal.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.480
I do not want your company, sherif.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.880
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.120
You will not find it,
and you will die.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.080
I will find it with this.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.240
Good army compass.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.640
How if I take it?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.320
Then you would be a thief.

29:00.440 --> 29:01.760
Have you no fear, English?

29:02.600 --> 29:05.080
My fear is my concern.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.880
Truly.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.640
God be with you, English.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.960
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

30:02.200 --> 30:04.040
You can hear the girls declare

30:04.280 --> 30:07.000
He must be a millionaire

30:24.760 --> 30:30.440
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

30:47.880 --> 30:49.600
Hey, you!

31:07.240 --> 31:10.240
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.640
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.200
How did he know?

31:14.440 --> 31:17.200
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.360
I'll give him that. No escort?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.000
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.000
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.560
Bloody savages.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.200
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.880
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

31:35.160 --> 31:39.000
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.800
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

31:44.000 --> 31:48.800
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.200
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.440
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

31:56.680 --> 32:00.480
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.040
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.800
What I want to say is this:

32:05.080 --> 32:07.600
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

32:07.800 --> 32:09.600
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

32:09.800 --> 32:13.400
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.400
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.360
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to...

32:22.840 --> 32:24.600
Oh, my God.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.000
Not again.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.720
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.960
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

33:02.840 --> 33:06.200
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

33:31.640 --> 33:34.920
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.200
Fire back at them.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.280
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.120
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.480
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.000
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.000
You were right and I was wrong.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.600
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.240
They can hardly come with us.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.640
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant?

35:16.480 --> 35:17.600
Lawrence.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.200
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...

35:20.360 --> 35:25.280
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.560
First the guns, and now this.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.200
Cigarette?

36:23.400 --> 36:24.800
I'm sorry.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.920
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

36:37.800 --> 36:39.040
Umph off.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.600
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

36:59.560 --> 37:00.640
Hold it, Jenkins!

37:04.840 --> 37:06.200
Jenkins!

37:15.240 --> 37:16.800
Lawrence?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.360
You have no servant.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.000
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

37:23.240 --> 37:26.840
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.960
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.160
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

37:54.360 --> 37:54.440
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.560
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.360
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

38:03.240 --> 38:08.360
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.720
Others do battle in His cause.

38:13.960 --> 38:18.080
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.400
And observe the prayers.

38:22.480 --> 38:27.760
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.600
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

38:33.320 --> 38:38.200
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...

38:38.440 --> 38:39.800
Greetings, Ali.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.720
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.000
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.600
Yes, my lord.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.200
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

38:53.400 --> 38:55.640
"By the noonday brightness...

38:55.880 --> 38:57.920
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

38:58.120 --> 39:00.480
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

39:00.680 --> 39:03.040
...neither hath He been displeased.

39:03.280 --> 39:07.360
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

39:07.640 --> 39:11.000
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

39:11.200 --> 39:13.400
...and thou be satisfied."

39:15.280 --> 39:16.600
So?

39:18.440 --> 39:19.640
Yes, colonel.

39:20.040 --> 39:23.560
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.400
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

39:26.600 --> 39:30.360
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.480
You could supply us through Aqaba!

39:32.840 --> 39:34.400
Aqaba!

39:35.160 --> 39:37.720
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.840
- But you can't!
- You could.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.760
You mean, the navy?

39:43.640 --> 39:46.840
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.960
Can you imagine what that means?

39:49.240 --> 39:50.880
Yes, I can imagine.

39:51.080 --> 39:55.120
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.760
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.960
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.960
You can see that, sir, surely.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.000
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.120
It is of little consequence to us.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.560
I must ask you not to speak like that.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.360
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.280
Possibly.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.040
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.800
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.080
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

40:26.360 --> 40:29.120
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

40:29.320 --> 40:32.120
No. Guns. Artillery.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.480
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.600
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.400
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.200
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

40:44.480 --> 40:48.400
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.920
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

40:57.640 --> 41:00.320
I think it is far from Damascus.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.840
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.920
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.840
Yes, my lord.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.360
It is beautiful, is it not?

41:11.640 --> 41:13.280
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.440
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.520
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.960
Small population compared with some.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.160
It's small, but it's great. And why?

41:28.440 --> 41:31.160
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.600
Because it has a navy,
because of this...

41:33.760 --> 41:35.360
...the English go
where they please...

41:35.640 --> 41:38.080
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.360
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

41:40.640 --> 41:42.760
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.040
But I would like to hear his opinion.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.560
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

41:47.840 --> 41:51.080
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

41:51.360 --> 41:56.360
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.960
My lord, I think...

42:01.880 --> 42:04.000
I think your book is right.

42:04.280 --> 42:08.520
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.680
On this ocean, the Bedu go
where they please...

42:10.840 --> 42:12.320
...and strike where they please.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.720
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.760
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.000
And this is the way you should
fight now.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.760
I don't know.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.160
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.920
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.200
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.440
No, colonel.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.800
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
They must say their say.

42:41.080 --> 42:45.880
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.480
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.200
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.000
You tread heavily...

42:56.040 --> 42:58.560
...but you speak the truth.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.480
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

43:03.880 --> 43:05.600
...it is late.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.040
Colonel Brighton means
to put my men...

43:23.240 --> 43:25.960
...under European officers,
does he not?

43:26.240 --> 43:28.000
In effect, my lord, yes.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.200
And I must do it...

43:30.760 --> 43:34.400
...because the Turks have
European guns.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.160
But I fear to do it...

43:38.040 --> 43:40.160
...upon my soul I do.

43:42.080 --> 43:46.040
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

43:46.280 --> 43:49.280
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.400
Then you must deny it to them.

43:51.640 --> 43:55.040
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

43:55.680 --> 43:58.480
To England and to other things.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.240
To England and Arabia both?

44:01.480 --> 44:03.200
And is that possible?

44:09.640 --> 44:13.720
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.000
Doughty, Stanhope...

44:16.520 --> 44:18.760
...Gordon of Khartoum.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.160
No Arab loves the desert.

44:21.440 --> 44:26.200
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.600
And no man needs nothing.

44:32.560 --> 44:36.000
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

44:36.280 --> 44:39.680
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

44:39.960 --> 44:44.000
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

44:44.280 --> 44:47.440
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

44:47.680 --> 44:50.040
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

44:50.280 --> 44:51.880
...when London was a village.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.840
Yes, you were great.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.120
Nine centuries ago.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.440
Time to be great again, my lord.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.800
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

45:03.040 --> 45:06.640
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.000
But my father is old...

45:10.960 --> 45:12.600
...and I...

45:14.200 --> 45:17.760
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.400
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.400
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

45:27.640 --> 45:28.640
...or...

45:28.840 --> 45:30.200
Or?

45:30.680 --> 45:34.200
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.800
We need a miracle.

48:34.480 --> 48:35.480
Aqaba.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.160
Aqaba.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.560
From the land.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.160
You are mad.

48:45.560 --> 48:49.800
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.200
That's right.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.600
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.600
I'll cross it if you will.

48:55.800 --> 48:59.800
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.720
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

49:02.920 --> 49:06.760
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.600
Fifty men?

49:08.840 --> 49:11.320
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

49:11.560 --> 49:13.840
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

49:14.080 --> 49:16.960
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.000
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

49:20.280 --> 49:23.200
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.600
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...

49:26.560 --> 49:29.760
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

49:30.040 --> 49:34.000
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

49:34.200 --> 49:37.760
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

49:38.040 --> 49:42.840
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.600
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.800
Aqaba's over there.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.360
It's only a matter of going.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.720
You are mad.

50:05.560 --> 50:08.000
And where are you going, lieutenant?

50:09.280 --> 50:11.200
With 50 of my men.

50:12.760 --> 50:13.920
To work your miracle.

50:14.280 --> 50:18.400
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

50:19.080 --> 50:21.560
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.360
Why not you?

50:24.960 --> 50:27.800
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

50:28.040 --> 50:30.240
Yes, I must.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.400
But I will spare these to you.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.200
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

50:38.800 --> 50:42.600
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.880
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.080
No.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.400
Since you do know...

51:00.880 --> 51:04.280
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

51:04.680 --> 51:07.800
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.560
But in whose name do you ride?

53:34.040 --> 53:36.640
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.000
They were here. I caught them.

53:39.200 --> 53:41.960
Why are you here? Boy!

53:42.200 --> 53:44.040
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.760
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.800
You have been tracking us.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.560
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

53:51.840 --> 53:53.760
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.840
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.560
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.000
Don't do that.

54:01.480 --> 54:05.960
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.160
Be warned. They are not suitable.

54:09.400 --> 54:13.000
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.880
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.440
One shilling, every week?

54:24.680 --> 54:26.200
That is fair.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.120
- Each?
- No.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.880
- That is too much.
- All right.

54:38.120 --> 54:42.160
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.720
There is the railway.

54:57.560 --> 55:00.360
And that is the desert.

55:01.800 --> 55:05.320
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.680
For the camels, no water at all.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.360
If the camels die...

55:12.640 --> 55:13.960
...we die.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.520
And in 20 days they will start to die.

55:22.800 --> 55:25.960
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

57:51.960 --> 57:53.600
I was thinking.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.440
You were drifting.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.840
Yes. It will not happen again.

58:01.160 --> 58:04.680
Be warned, you were drifting.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.240
It will not happen again.

59:06.880 --> 59:08.680
That water is wasted.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.080
From now on,
we must travel by night...

59:16.360 --> 59:19.120
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.680
A few hours each day.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.320
Why don't we start now?

59:25.440 --> 59:28.040
No. We will rest now.

59:29.720 --> 59:30.800
Three hours.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.320
Fine.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.280
I'll wake you.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.720
Do we rest here?

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.000
There is no rest now short of water.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.200
The other side of that.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.400
And how much of that is there?

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.200
I'm not sure.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.400
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.600
This is the sun's anvil.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.600
Have we done it?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.840
No, but we're off the anvil.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.160
Thank God for that anyway.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.200
Yes, thank Him.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.880
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.360
I know.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.000
We've done it.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.760
God willing.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.760
When do we reach the wells?

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.160
God willing, midday.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.880
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.960
Gasim's.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.360
What's happened to him?

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.560
God knows.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.960
Why don't you stop?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.760
For what? He will be dead by midday.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.560
We must go back.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.560
What for, to die with Gasim?

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.960
In one hour comes the sun.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.840
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.360
I can.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.760
Take the boys.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.760
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.160
Gasim you have killed already.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.920
Get out of my way.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.960
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.440
Nothing is written!

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.760
Go back, then!

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.360
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.160
English blasphemer!

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.720
Aqaba?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.920
Was it Aqaba?

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.360
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.840
Go back, blasphemer...

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.320
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.320
I shall be at Aqaba.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.520
That is written.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.360
In here.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.520
English!

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.360
English!

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.040
Lawrence! Daud!

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.200
Nothing is written.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.560
Al Lawrence.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.200
Farraj.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.400
Wash.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.680
Al Lawrence.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.560
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.920
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.760
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.160
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.920
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.800
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.760
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.160
No.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.960
You have an elder brother.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.360
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.720
He didn't marry my mother.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.760
I see.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.560
I'm sorry.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.200
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.080
Yes, I suppose I am.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.000
Al Lawrence is best.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.760
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.160
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.960
Very fine.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.760
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.320
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.160
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.960
They are good for riding. Try.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.080
What are you doing, Englishman?

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.920
As you see.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.120
Are you alone?

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.080
Almost.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.760
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.320
Yours?

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.520
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.920
I've heard of another man
of that name.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.400
Other? What other?

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.800
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.240
He must be a great hero.

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.080
He is.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.360
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of Nefud Desert.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.680
Now, would he not?

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.920
No, that must be some other man.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.120
Here is my help.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.440
Son, what fashion is this?

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.280
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.200
A Beni Wejh sherif.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.560
And is he Harith?

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.920
No, Father, English.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.320
Son...

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120
...they are stealing our water.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.760
Tell them we are coming.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.520
Tell them.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.160
- Empty that!
- Do not!

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.440
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.120
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.920
Harith.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.880
Ali.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.720
Does your father still steal?

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.880
No.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.280
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.480
No. There is no resemblance.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.640
Alas, you resemble your father.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.840
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.720
I knew your father well.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.920
Did you know your own?

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.720
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.120
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.280
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.760
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.880
Call off your men.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.760
This honours the unworthy.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.080
I've only just begun to teach him.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.400
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.560
Be not clever with me, English.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.360
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.520
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.200
Is he your tongue?

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.600
We do desire it.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.600
Then it is given, if you will take it.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.840
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.640
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.600
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.000
But...

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.760
...dine with me.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.480
Dine with Auda, English.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.640
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.960
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.600
This thing you work against Aqaba...

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.280
...what profit do you hope from it?

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.960
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.200
The Harith do not work for profit.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.920
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.800
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.840
But I...
I cannot serve.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.600
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.760
Yes, it is my pleasure.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.880
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.360
No?

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.920
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.880
The Arabs?

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.760
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.880
I have even heard of the Harith.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.960
But the Arabs?

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.480
What tribe is that?

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.080
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.240
Well, they are nothing to me.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.280
My tribe is the Howeitat.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.760
Who work only for profit.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.520
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.240
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.560
Serve?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I serve?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.760
It is the servant who takes money.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.480
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.520
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.720
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.120
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.920
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.160
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.280
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.480
Because I am a river to my people.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.960
Is that service?

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.720
No.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.520
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.320
And lost his taste for fighting.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.520
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.360
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.280
Why should they wish to?

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.360
Now...

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.960
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.360
...a servant's wages.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.360
They pay me, month by month...

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.480
...100 golden guineas.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.680
150, Auda.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.720
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.120
And a long tongue between them.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.520
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.360
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.480
In Aqaba.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:57.280
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.920
You trouble me like women.

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:04.280
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.000
- For money?
- No.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.480
- For Feisal?
- No!

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.640
Nor to drive away the Turks.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.160
He will come...

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.280
...because it is his pleasure.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.680
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.360
Make God your agent!

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.720
Aqaba!

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.520
Aqaba!

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.480
God be with you.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.920
God be with you.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.280
God be with you.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.680
God be with you.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.440
Yes.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760
Aqaba.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.880
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.880
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:12.680
If you are right about the guns.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.080
He killed. He dies.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.880
This is the end of Aqaba.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.240
One of our men
murdered Auda's man.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.360
Why?

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.480
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.080
Ali!

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.240
It is an ancient wound.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.280
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.640
It is the law, Lawrence.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.080
The law says the man must die.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:12.880
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.080
Yes.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.920
Sherif Ali!

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.000
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.480
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.880
Then I will execute the law.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.880
I have no tribe.

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.280
And no one is offended.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.200
Gasim.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.880
Did you do it?

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.320
Well, Lawrence...

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.840
What ails the Englishman?

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.360
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.480
It was written, then.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.240
Better to have left him.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.880
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.480
Besides, it was necessary.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.640
You gave life and you took it.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.680
The writing is still yours.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360
Auda Abu Tayi!

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.520
The miracle is accomplished.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.040
Garlands for the conqueror.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.320
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.720
I'm none of those things, Ali.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.480
- What, then?
- Don't know.

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:19.760
Thanks.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.320
My God, I love this country.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.880
What!

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.680
No gold in Aqaba!

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.320
Auda, I found it!

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.720
That's a pity.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.560
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.160
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.400
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.680
And you?

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.880
I'm going to tell the generals...

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.120
...in Cairo.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.520
Yes, cross Sinai.

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.800
Come on!

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.400
Sinai?

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.160
Yes.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.160
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.200
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.240
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.240
I see.

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.840
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.080
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.880
...and then they will believe you.

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.480
You're an ignorant man.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.200
Paper.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.800
Paper!

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.000
There is no gold in Aqaba.

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.840
No gold.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.080
No great box!

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.360
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.120
For my pleasure, as you said.

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.720
But gold is honorable...

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.360
...and Lawrence promised gold.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:32.520
Lawrence lied.

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.800
See, Auda.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.400
"The Crown of England...

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.840
...promises to pay...

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.040
...5000 golden guineas...

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.040
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:59.280
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.920
...by...

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.720
...me.

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.840
In 10 days...

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560
...I'll be back with the gold.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.200
With gold, with guns, with everything.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.840
Ten days.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.640
You'll cross Sinai?

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.240
Why not?

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.640
Moses did.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.280
And you will take the children?

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.880
Moses did.

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.720
Moses was a prophet...

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.720
...and beloved of God.

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.800
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.800
He is not perfect.

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.880
Lord, can we not rest?

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.080
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.880
Have you two slept in beds?

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.320
Farraj?

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.160
Daud?

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.960
With sheets?

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.120
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.600
I promise.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.400
Then it shall be so, lord.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.040
Look!

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.080
Pillar of fire.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.080
No, lord. Dust.

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:47.360
My compass.

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.360
No matter.

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.360
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.960
Due west.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.720
Come on!

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.320
Lawrence!

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:05.760
Farraj!

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.360
Farraj, don't! Don't!

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.760
Don't!

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:53.440
Why do you walk?

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.920
But why, lord?

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.000
But why, lord?

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.520
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.600
Lawrence, look!

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:48.680
It's all right, Farraj.

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.360
It's all right.

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.160
Who are you?

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.760
Who are you?

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:42.200
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:01.160
You taking him in there?

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.560
Yes.

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.600
Here!

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.680
Here. You!

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:33.520
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.680
We are thirsty.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:39.760
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:43.160
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.560
You can't take him in there, sir.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.520
What do you think you look like?

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.000
No, no. You must go.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.720
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:18.160
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.800
We want two large glasses
of lemonade.

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.720
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.600
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.320
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.200
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.280
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.960
What's going on?

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:56.560
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.360
Explain yourself.

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:01.720
We've taken Aqaba.

01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.800
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:09.360
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.360
We have.

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.840
He likes your lemonade.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.040
You mean the Turks have gone?

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.120
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.560
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.160
That's not true. We killed some.

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.160
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.240
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.600
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.480
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.560
I did it.

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.200
You'd better talk to Allenby.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.120
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.520
That's a step in the right direction.

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.880
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:03.760
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:08.200
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.360
See Allenby first, though.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.560
Will he see me?

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:14.760
I think so.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.960
Do that, then.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:24.160
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.880
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.360
"Undisciplined.

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:43.040
Unpunctual.

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.000
Untidy.

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.800
Several languages.

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.960
Knowledge of music...

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.480
...literature.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.400
Knowledge of...

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:01.400
Knowledge of..."

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.360
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.960
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:13.800
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:15.320
Then why did you?

01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.920
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.560
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:24.760
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:29.360
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.920
True.

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:35.560
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.680
Am I going for Jerusalem?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.160
Yes.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.800
Very well.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.200
Aqaba behind my right.

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:49.160
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.760
Anything else?

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.160
Yes.

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.800
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.200
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:02.840
No. I think you should
leave them there.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.960
You acted without orders, you know.

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:09.720
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.160
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.600
Yes, I know.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.360
Already?

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.760
Yes.

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.960
I'm promoting you major.

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.080
I don't think that's a very good idea.

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:28.240
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:31.960
...and carry on the good work.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:35.160
No. Thank you, sir.

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:39.440
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.960
Let me see now...

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:46.200
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.520
One was a boy.

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:50.120
That was...

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.440
...yesterday.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.600
I led him into a quicksand.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.440
The other was a man.

02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.640
That was...

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.160
...before Aqaba, anyway.

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.400
I had to execute him with my pistol.

02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.800
There was something about it
I didn't like.

02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:12.040
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.480
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:18.680
No. Something else.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.800
What, then?

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:24.920
I enjoyed it.

02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:35.520
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.680
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.520
Yes. Entirely.

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.760
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.000
Fascinating gear they wear.

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:50.400
How would I look in this, Harry?

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.960
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:58.760
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.720
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.120
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.320
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.640
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.760
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:20.960
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:24.240
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.960
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:34.120
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.440
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.560
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.560
Come on, then.

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:53.760
You're a clever man, sir.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.520
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:00.360
That's fair, surely?

02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:24.920
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.360
- Bravo.
- You know better?

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.840
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:51.360
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.760
Easy, gentlemen, please.

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:32.040
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.960
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:37.840
Tracy.

02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:41.440
Shall we go outside?

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:55.320
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.520
Yes.

02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:56.800
With 1000 Arabs?

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.960
With 1000 Arabs?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.120
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.240
It means 1000 camels.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:11.640
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:15.760
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.160
I'll smash his railways.

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.800
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.720
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:26.240
You are going back, then?

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.160
Yes.

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.760
Of course I'm going back.

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.280
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:43.600
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.920
...he'll withdraw.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.760
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:50.400
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.040
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:55.800
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.760
That's what I've told them anyway.

02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:05.960
That's what they think.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.520
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.560
They've only one suspicion.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.160
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:23.720
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.920
Have we?

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.520
I'm not a politician, thank God.

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:30.720
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.840
Difficult question, sir.

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.400
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:42.840
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.320
Certainly.

02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:05.440
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.760
Right.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.240
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:14.440
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.160
More money.

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:19.520
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:22.320
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:25.240
A couple of armoured cars.

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.760
Right.

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.960
Field artillery.

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.360
Right.

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.360
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:40.360
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:43.160
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.160
Congratulations!

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:32.000
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.960
I was wondering that, sir.

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:36.280
Might be difficult to get it back.

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:39.920
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.000
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.080
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:46.960
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:49.080
Not like that poor devil.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.040
He's riding the whirlwind.

02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.400
Let's hope we're not.

02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.240
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:44.960
To Prince Feisal.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.840
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.360
You know him though?

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:52.880
He is my master. I am his servant.

02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:57.200
Can you read?

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.840
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:13.480
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:28.200
Now...

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:33.160
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.400
Not altogether, sir, no.

02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:39.840
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.000
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:44.400
I don't know.

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:47.600
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.520
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.920
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.480
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:00.360
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:01.800
They do.

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:05.080
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:06.800
Myself...

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.240
...I am going to Cairo.

02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:11.320
- As you know.
- Yes.

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:13.960
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.640
Yes.

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.360
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.240
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.400
It restricts us to small things.

02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.840
It's intended to.

02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:31.960
Do you know General Allenby?

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.280
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:39.160
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.200
Slim customer. It's very good.

02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.840
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:50.440
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.960
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:55.280
...who struggle for their freedom.

02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:57.600
Very gratifying.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.400
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.800
I badly want a story to tell.

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.640
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:14.040
I will give you a guide and a letter.

02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:16.120
And before I leave here...

02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.600
...which must be presently...

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.200
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.040
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:28.320
I do, sir.

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:31.360
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.960
My army is made up of tribes.

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.040
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:40.280
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:43.400
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.200
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.280
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:54.000
...beyond every other man.

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:57.680
One figure I can give you
from my head...

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:01.400
...because it never leaves my head.

02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.760
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:09.000
...37 wounded...

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:14.640
...156 dead.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.760
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.200
Yeah.

02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.840
Four times as many.

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.600
That's because those too wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:31.200
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.160
- You mean?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:38.880
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:43.400
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:45.440
...and are treated harshly.

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:47.160
How harshly?

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.200
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:51.920
I see.

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.200
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:59.080
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.160
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.680
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.440
Why should you suppose?

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.000
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.560
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.360
That is exactly so.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.920
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.000
With me, it is merely good manners.

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.160
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:30.040
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.560
Thank you, sir.

02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:37.440
Can you manage the letter...?

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.440
I'll do everything I have said...

02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.040
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.560
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:51.400
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.040
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.320
Oh, no.

02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:59.200
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:02.040
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:04.120
And Turkey.

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.560
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.400
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:14.520
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.160
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:21.440
All right. Yes.

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:23.600
Lawrence is your man.

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:02.840
Stop!

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.000
Stop it!

02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:25.120
Stop it!

02:16:32.959 --> 02:16:34.360
Come on, men!

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.000
Lawrence!

02:18:01.879 --> 02:18:03.799
Good God! God!

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.840
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.240
Why don't you take a picture?

02:18:55.639 --> 02:18:56.840
Wish I had.

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.000
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:06.160
Am I in this?

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.760
Did you take his picture?

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.200
Yeah.

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.440
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:22.799
Charming company you keep.

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.240
Auda?

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.840
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.160
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:34.440
It's all right to take your picture?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.440
- All right.
- Okay.

02:19:36.639 --> 02:19:38.040
Just walk.

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:37.840
Major Lawrence!

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.040
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:51.240
This looting has got to stop!

02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.760
It is customary.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.440
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:58.840
I would not say that to Auda.

02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.960
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:04.840
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:08.880
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:17.400
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:19.240
They'll come back.

02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:22.880
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.240
Not this year, Lawrence.

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:30.160
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:33.040
- Less.
- Well, then?

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:35.640
I said, they'll come back.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:37.440
You badly hurt?

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.600
Not hurt at all.

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:44.840
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:03.640
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:07.440
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:12.400
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.240
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:18.680
Did I answer well?

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:23.040
You answered without
saying anything. That's politics.

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.880
You learn quickly.

02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:29.240
I have a good teacher.

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:33.040
Yeah.

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:42.240
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:47.080
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:50.200
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:53.680
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.000
One.

02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:59.240
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:01.840
They hope to gain their freedom.

02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:04.120
Freedom.

02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:08.040
"They hope to gain their freedom."

02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:11.800
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.640
I'm going to give it to them.

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:21.840
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:26.120
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:30.040
It's clean.

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:34.200
Well, now...

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.080
...that's a very illuminating answer.

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:39.000
May I...

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:42.040
...take one farewell picture?

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.720
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.840
One clock for two lamps.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.480
A fair bargain.

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:53.240
Fair? I robbed him.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:05.640
Trash.

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:09.080
I must find something honorable.

02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:10.840
Honorable?

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.040
The year is running out, Brighton.

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:22.120
I must find something honorable.

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:49.560
Now you may blow up my train.

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.440
And what will you do now?

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:56.040
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.680
They will carry my toys too, see?

02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:02.040
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.520
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:10.160
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.840
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:14.640
No, I shan't, Auda.

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:16.760
Then you are a fool.

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:20.280
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:23.440
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.640
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.

02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:29.840
You are an impudent rascal.

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.440
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:47.080
Like talking to a brick wall.

02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.960
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:00.240
I'll go north.

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:03.280
That's what Allenby wants.

02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.440
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.840
Then that's where I'll take it.

02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:15.480
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:16.840
Won't we?

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Train, Farraj.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.440
Yeah, Lawrence.

02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:21.240
Hide yourself, my friend.

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.440
Detonator.

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:46.040
All right, fetch another.

02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:49.840
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:56.440
Farraj?

02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:09.240
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:24.560
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.

02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:36.440
If they take him alive,
you know what they'll do to him.

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.640
Daud will be angry with you.

02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.440
Salute him for me.

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:14.040
What will you do now?

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:16.840
Go north.

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:18.440
With twenty?

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:21.640
What would
you recommend me to do?

02:31:23.320 --> 02:31:25.240
What would you recommend?

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.240
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.

02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:34.240
He's lied, in fact.

02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:39.080
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:41.840
Then there is an Arab north army.

02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:47.640
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:51.840
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.640
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:58.440
No.

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:03.000
He would if he could, I think.

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:08.040
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:10.840
What matters is I believed it.

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:12.760
The Turks believe it.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.240
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:19.800
Good heavens.

02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:23.800
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man...

02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:28.240
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:32.040
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:37.640
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:39.760
I wouldn't be surprised.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.480
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:00.920
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:04.560
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:09.240
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:11.640
So say they love you.

02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:14.440
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:17.640
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:19.920
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:23.240
That's right. That's right.

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.200
Who are you to know
what can be done?

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:30.160
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:35.000
Whatever I ask them to do can
be done. They know that if you don't.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.840
Do you think I'm just anybody?

02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:41.640
Do you?

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:47.920
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:55.440
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:57.640
Will you take 20 against 2000?

02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:01.440
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.480
Because I told the English generals...

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:07.200
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.640
Or perhaps you are here...

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:12.120
...for the English generals.

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:15.640
Who says this?

02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:17.240
Rumour.

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:20.880
That is not an argument.

02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:23.240
Oh, argument.

02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.680
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:29.240
...while the Arabs argue.

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:34.080
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:38.040
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:48.120
It's madness.

02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:53.160
What are you looking for?

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.760
Some way to announce myself.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.840
Be patient with him, God.

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:14.800
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.240
Halt!

02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:17.640
Walk on.

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:19.640
- Halt!
- Walk on.

02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.840
You and you.

02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:45.480
You.

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.280
You have blue eyes.

02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:08.200
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:11.560
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:13.920
How old are you?

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:17.040
Twenty-seven, effendi.

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.080
I think.

02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:23.640
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:26.880
It's an interesting face.

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:33.680
I am surrounded by cattle.

02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.840
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:42.640
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:47.080
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:49.040
...isolated.

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:53.360
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.240
No, effendi.

02:37:57.720 --> 02:37:59.040
Have you?

02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.440
No.

02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:03.880
That would be too...

02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:05.640
...lucky.

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:30.800
Where did you get that?

02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.640
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:40.760
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.800
Yes, you are a deserter.

02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:46.040
But from which army?

02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.600
Not that it matters at all.

02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:53.160
A man cannot be always in uniform.

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.080
Your skin is very fair.

02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:25.400
Beat him.

02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:57.360
To me!

02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:56.520
Sleep.

02:42:58.080 --> 02:42:59.560
Sleep.

02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:12.160
Eat.

02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:18.680
Eat.

02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:25.160
You have a body, like other men.

02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:34.520
Good.

02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.400
Then sleep.

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.520
Better?

02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.720
Much better. You were right.

02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:57.040
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

02:43:57.960 --> 02:43:59.920
Oh, I've learned all right.

02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:07.120
I'm going, Ali.

02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:10.160
- Why?
- Why?

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.640
Heavens.

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:14.120
Why?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.120
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.320
And the end of the Arab revolt?

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:22.560
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:25.720
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.840
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:30.920
You proved it.

02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:33.240
Look, Ali. Look.

02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:37.120
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:40.080
And there's nothing I can do about it.

02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:42.840
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:45.960
He can...

02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:48.920
...but he can't want what he wants.

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:52.920
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.280
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:03.280
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:06.160
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:09.720
Well, any man is what I am.

02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:14.520
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:16.720
...that any man can do.

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:18.840
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:21.720
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.520
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:32.560
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:34.360
...ordinarily...

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.360
...happy.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.560
Can I take this?

02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:44.000
It is not clean.

02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.160
No, but it's warm.

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:48.760
And these...

02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:52.760
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:59.200
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:03.440
And let me go back to mine.

02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:34.360
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:41.760
Mind if I join you?

02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.160
Honoured, sir.

02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:49.560
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:52.560
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.960
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.400
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:00.960
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:02.560
Jolly good.

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:07.160
Well, I have to go up there.

02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:10.520
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:12.400
Bloody wogs.

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:15.560
Yes, probably.

02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:18.520
Jolly good about the squash court.

02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.560
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:37.480
Morning.

02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:39.360
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.

02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:42.560
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:47.000
Hello.

02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:50.560
Morning. You're to go right in.

02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:03.520
Lawrence.

02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:07.640
Or is it Major Lawrence?

02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:09.640
Sir.

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:16.960
Well, general, I will leave you.

02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:20.000
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.920
...about my people
and their weakness...

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:28.760
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.520
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:36.680
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.

02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:41.240
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.360
I know this treaty does exist.

02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:45.440
Treaty, sir?

02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:49.440
He does it better than you, general.

02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:52.840
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:08.000
You really don't know?

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:12.120
Then what the devil's this?

02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:16.840
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:18.400
For what reason?

02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.760
You sure you haven't heard
of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:22.280
No.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.040
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:29.120
Well, now...

02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:32.440
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.

02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:35.640
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:39.880
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:43.360
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.280
Including Arabia.

02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:49.440
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:52.640
An agreement to that effect.

02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:56.680
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.560
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:02.800
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.520
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:10.960
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:15.760
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:19.440
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:22.240
You might have told me that, Dryden.

02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:25.560
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:28.040
That's my reason for resigning.

02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:30.840
It's personal.

02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:33.160
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:36.400
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.840
And as it happens, a damned
important one. Are you mad?

02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:43.160
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:45.360
That's my reason too.

02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.360
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:52.440
...and you are part of it.

02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:56.440
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:00.400
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:03.080
What about your Arab friends?

02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:06.960
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:09.280
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:14.400
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:17.440
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:22.680
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:24.960
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:26.840
Thank you, sir.

02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:30.000
Why don't we?

02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:34.240
There's blood on your back.

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:38.440
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.640
Tell me what happened.

02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:48.440
Say, what goes on in there?

02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.040
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:54.560
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?

02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:58.560
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:02.520
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:06.040
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:08.880
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:13.240
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:16.440
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.360
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.280
Always walking away, aren't you?

02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:24.000
Well, I'll tell you.

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:27.040
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:30.040
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

02:52:30.280 --> 02:52:32.920
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:36.640
I believe your name will
be a household word...

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:40.640
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:44.240
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:46.240
Leave me alone.

02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:48.920
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:51.640
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:54.520
All right, I'm extraordinary.

02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:57.480
What of it?

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:00.440
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:03.640
It's a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has.

02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.880
Are you speaking from experience?

02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:07.480
No.

02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:09.440
You're guessing, then.

02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:11.840
Suppose you're wrong.

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:15.000
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:18.640
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...

02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:23.040
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?

02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:25.240
I'll give you a lot of money.

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:28.240
- Artillery?
- I can't.

02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:32.240
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:34.640
They'll be coming for Damascus.

02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:37.600
Which I'm going to give them.

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:40.000
That's all I want.

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:43.840
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:48.120
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:51.440
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:53.920
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:55.440
Fair enough.

02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:58.720
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:01.240
It's going to happen.

02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:03.920
I shall want quite a lot of money.

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:06.200
All there is.

02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:08.240
Not that much.

02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:14.040
The best of them
won't come for money.

02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.200
They'll come for me.

02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:36.120
No pictures!

02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.640
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.

02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.840
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:45.240
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:52.000
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back?

02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:53.520
Yes.

02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:55.960
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

02:54:56.120 --> 02:54:58.920
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:07.000
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:12.240
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:16.320
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:18.200
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.280
- I did.
- What did he say?

02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:22.000
He laughed.

02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:25.040
He told me to gather the Harith here.

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.040
He offered me money.

02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:28.800
Did you take it?

02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:32.080
No. But many did.

02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:11.200
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:14.400
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:18.120
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.240
The sheiks will hang these men.

02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:22.200
These men are mine.

02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:26.840
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.480
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:33.520
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.600
Aye, but for what?

02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:37.880
Sherif, for Lawrence.

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:44.040
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:46.920
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:50.000
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:55.600
Damascus!

02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:57.840
Damascus! Damascus!

02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:01.000
Damascus! Damascus!

02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:36.920
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:40.640
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:44.360
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume...

02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:45.520
Certainly.

02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:47.360
He can't be far from Mallud...

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:52.120
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:54.280
Splendid. Philip.

02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:57.240
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:00.880
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:04.840
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.240
Any questions?

02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:10.600
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:13.200
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:15.200
Where are they now?

02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:20.600
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:23.080
Pound them, Charley.

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:25.000
Pound them.

02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:37.840
God help the men who lie under that.

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.640
They're Turks.

02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:41.440
God help them.

02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:26.000
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:27.520
Cocky?

02:59:27.720 --> 02:59:29.400
More than cocky, sir.

02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:32.840
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:36.400
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:38.800
- Unless...
- Unless?

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:42.720
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

02:59:42.960 --> 02:59:45.840
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:50.800
I wonder where they are now.

03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.840
No prisoners.

03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:35.200
Damascus, Lawrence.

03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:47.440
Lawrence, not this.

03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:51.960
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:54.200
No prisoners.

03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:05.440
This was Talaal's village.

03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:11.440
Talaal!

03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:22.200
Talaal!

03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:32.800
No prisoners!

03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:34.320
No prisoners!

03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:46.960
God.

03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:51.840
God.

03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:55.040
God!

03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:09.720
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:44.320
Major!

03:06:44.920 --> 03:06:46.520
Major Lawrence!

03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:53.520
Jesus wept.

03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:09.680
Jesus wept.

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:13.480
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:16.720
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

03:07:16.960 --> 03:07:18.720
Barbarous and cruel.

03:07:19.480 --> 03:07:21.320
Who but they?

03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:23.000
Who but they?

03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:27.520
Oh, you rotten man.

03:07:28.520 --> 03:07:32.760
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:36.760
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:05.520
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:07.600
Damascus!

03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:09.560
Take them to Sherif Ali.

03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:11.160
Tell him.

03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:13.720
Remind him.

03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:17.560
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.

03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:20.560
Tell Sherif Ali that.

03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:23.520
They are not ripe.

03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:31.160
General salute!

03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:33.560
Present arms!

03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:49.120
Port arms!

03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:53.600
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

03:08:53.800 --> 03:08:56.560
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:04.320
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:06.360
They've been here a day and a night.

03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:08.960
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:12.960
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:15.560
What else beside the town hall?

03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:18.560
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:21.120
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:24.160
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:25.920
...and they're in the town hall.

03:09:26.200 --> 03:09:28.960
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.000
What should we do about it?

03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:34.520
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:37.120
How about that, Dryden?

03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:41.440
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:45.080
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:47.240
By special train in two days' time.

03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:48.760
Two days.

03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:52.160
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.400
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:57.880
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:01.600
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:05.920
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:07.840
Does that apply to technical units?

03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:10.120
Technical units particularly.

03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:11.680
Yes, sir.

03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:13.600
Medicals too, sir?

03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:15.960
I'm afraid so, Harry.

03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:17.920
Medicals too.

03:10:56.640 --> 03:10:58.120
We here...

03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:01.120
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

03:11:01.320 --> 03:11:04.360
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:07.960
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

03:11:08.200 --> 03:11:10.120
He insulted me.

03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:15.160
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:18.120
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.120
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:25.760
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:30.360
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

03:11:31.240 --> 03:11:34.560
You speak to me of bloodshed?

03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:40.960
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:42.680
Humbly?

03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:44.200
Humbly, Harith?

03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:46.360
Yes, humbly.

03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:48.760
This is a new trick.

03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:51.320
Why is there no electricity?

03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:54.880
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:57.880
There are three large machines.

03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:00.360
He means generators!

03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:01.960
So.

03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:04.000
One of them is burning.

03:12:04.240 --> 03:12:07.240
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:10.160
It is so of all machines.

03:12:10.360 --> 03:12:14.200
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:19.800
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:23.560
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:24.960
Take...

03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:30.120
Fire has broken out.

03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:31.800
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:34.800
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:36.680
Then use the fire brigade!

03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:39.680
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:41.320
Then you must carry it.

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:45.760
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

03:12:57.560 --> 03:13:00.960
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:05.360
This afternoon!

03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:31.960
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

03:13:32.160 --> 03:13:35.960
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:38.960
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:41.600
Sorry, sir.

03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:45.360
Maybe it's the bulb.

03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:50.960
No, sir.

03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:52.960
It's the power.

03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:08.880
They're leaving.

03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:11.160
That's it, then.

03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:13.680
Marvellous-Iooking beggars,
aren't they?

03:14:34.040 --> 03:14:36.800
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:38.960
- Come where?
- Back.

03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:45.360
I know your heart.

03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:55.000
What is it?

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:57.560
Is it this?

03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:03.160
I tell you, this is nothing.

03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:17.440
Is it the blood?

03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.160
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:26.840
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

03:15:27.880 --> 03:15:29.120
Hear me, God.

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:34.400
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

03:15:50.600 --> 03:15:51.840
What about you?

03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:56.240
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:00.000
A very low occupation.

03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:03.360
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.760
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:16.800
It's what I came for.

03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:21.360
And then...

03:16:23.680 --> 03:16:25.000
...it would be something.

03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:26.400
Yes.

03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:28.160
Much.

03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:48.800
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:50.240
- You love him.
- I fear him.

03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:52.200
Then why do you weep?

03:16:52.520 --> 03:16:54.560
If I fear him, who love him...

03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:57.600
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:00.960
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:06.440
So you are not yet entirely politician.

03:17:06.600 --> 03:17:07.640
Not yet.

03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:12.040
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:14.400
And Allah be thanked.

03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:16.200
I'll tell thee what...

03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:19.680
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:43.440
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:46.440
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

03:17:46.640 --> 03:17:50.840
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:53.960
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

03:17:54.240 --> 03:17:55.720
No, sir, I will not.

03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:58.160
Control yourself.

03:17:58.640 --> 03:18:01.640
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:04.760
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

03:18:04.960 --> 03:18:07.680
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:12.320
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:17.360
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:25.200
What's it like?

03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:40.880
This is outrageous!

03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:43.760
Outrageous!

03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:48.560
Outrageous!

03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:51.720
You filthy little wog!

03:20:01.800 --> 03:20:05.720
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

03:20:05.960 --> 03:20:08.320
"My friend Lawrence."

03:20:08.560 --> 03:20:12.960
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:15.720
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:20.840
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:24.560
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:28.160
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:31.720
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:34.720
You're promoted colonel.

03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:37.280
Yes. What for?

03:20:37.480 --> 03:20:40.560
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:44.720
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

03:20:45.280 --> 03:20:47.480
Then, thank you.

03:20:51.520 --> 03:20:52.720
Well, then...

03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:54.280
...Godspeed.

03:20:54.760 --> 03:20:58.520
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:02.720
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

03:21:02.960 --> 03:21:05.200
Young men make wars,
and the virtues of war...

03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:07.160
...are the virtues of young men.

03:21:07.400 --> 03:21:10.720
Courage and hope for the future.

03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:13.520
Then old men make the peace.

03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:17.360
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:19.920
Mistrust and caution.

03:21:20.800 --> 03:21:22.560
It must be so.

03:21:38.320 --> 03:21:42.720
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

03:21:52.080 --> 03:21:55.600
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

03:21:55.840 --> 03:21:57.520
The pumping plant I must retain.

03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:00.160
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:03.960
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

03:22:04.200 --> 03:22:07.920
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:09.760
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.

03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:12.280
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

03:22:12.600 --> 03:22:14.360
I'm sure your government...

03:22:14.600 --> 03:22:18.320
...does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor.

03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:21.920
I say!

03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:25.120
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:29.520
May I shake your hand, sir?

03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:33.120
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:38.720
Haven't we met before?

03:22:38.960 --> 03:22:40.480
Don't think so, sir.

03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:43.320
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:52.320
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:54.440
They have no power. It's illusory.

03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:57.040
Illusions can be very powerful.

03:22:57.400 --> 03:22:58.920
Particularly...

03:22:59.800 --> 03:23:02.320
...when they take this form.

03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:07.240
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:09.360
...liberated by the Arab army.

03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:12.800
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

03:23:13.320 --> 03:23:18.160
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

03:23:18.400 --> 03:23:21.320
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

03:23:24.800 --> 03:23:26.920
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

03:23:27.720 --> 03:23:29.920
You are merely a general.

03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:33.840
I must be a king.

03:23:36.720 --> 03:23:38.520
Excuse me, sir.

03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:53.760
Well?

03:23:54.600 --> 03:23:55.960
Well...

03:23:56.360 --> 03:23:59.160
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:01.520
...with an Arab flag on it.

03:24:01.720 --> 03:24:03.560
Do you think it was worth it?

03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:06.280
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:07.760
Yes, sir.

03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:09.560
So you keep saying.

03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:11.320
You, I suspect...

03:24:11.800 --> 03:24:15.520
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:18.920
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:23.680
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:03.120
Well, sir. Going home.

03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:06.920
Home, sir.

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:17.120
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you

03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:20.400
Though it breaks my heart to go

03:25:21.305 --> 03:25:27.559
