00:12.761 --> 00:14.462
I gotta get home.

00:15.803 --> 00:17.853
I meant it last night.

00:18.545 --> 00:20.192
We'll talk later.

00:26.420 --> 00:27.157
Hurry up!

00:27.157 --> 00:28.700
Here, let's take this.

00:29.074 --> 00:31.256
- What's that for?
- It's just for show.

00:39.976 --> 00:40.811
Work?

00:40.811 --> 00:41.815
- Take me.
- Work, work, work.

00:41.815 --> 00:43.270
- I work. Por favor?
- Eh, work?

00:43.270 --> 00:44.251
I work hard.

00:44.251 --> 00:46.808
I work hard. Eh?

00:53.076 --> 00:55.521
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

00:55.521 --> 00:58.188
Me either.
And I waited up.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.654
I was working on my film.
I didn't want to wake you.

01:01.654 --> 01:03.454
Your mother was worried.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.712
Sorry, Eme.

01:04.712 --> 01:06.100
You'll be home for dinner?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.687
Yeah, I'll try.

01:24.062 --> 01:24.974
Hey!

01:24.974 --> 01:26.633
Hey, I'm talking to you.

01:28.207 --> 01:30.662
Was it you? Huh?

01:30.865 --> 01:32.230
Was it you?

01:32.230 --> 01:33.543
- Did you hit the baby?
- No.

01:33.543 --> 01:34.939
Was it you?

01:36.280 --> 01:37.334
Are you crazy, man?

01:37.334 --> 01:38.496
Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna dare you.

01:38.496 --> 01:40.618
- You crazy?
- Get out of our neighborhood!

01:40.618 --> 01:41.942
Hold him!

01:42.372 --> 01:43.544
Come on!

01:47.480 --> 01:50.046
Stop! Don't!
I'm taping all of you!

01:51.298 --> 01:53.181
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:54.715 --> 01:55.516
Get her.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.722
Come on, come on, get her!

01:57.722 --> 01:59.340
Terrorist bitch!

01:59.954 --> 02:01.360
Give me the camera.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.038
Get away from me.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.501
- Give me the camera.
- Get away from my camera!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2007/01/02

02:59.270 --> 03:01.537
Meena Hasni, 19.

03:01.537 --> 03:04.409
Student of Queensboro
community college.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.501
4911.

03:08.501 --> 03:10.520
It's for 9/11?
Another hate crime?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.248
Third attack on a Muslim this month.

03:12.248 --> 03:13.475
If you're keeping score.

03:13.475 --> 03:15.552
- You have any witnesses?
- We're canvassing.

03:15.552 --> 03:18.505
ME puts the death within an hour
of midnight either way.

03:18.505 --> 03:20.915
Pretty quiet around here by then.

03:22.922 --> 03:26.339
Whoever it was, they smashed
the hell out of her face.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.690
Yeah, but they left her gold bracelets,

03:28.690 --> 03:31.065
her watch, her wallet.

03:31.065 --> 03:32.752
Somebody was sending a message.

03:32.752 --> 03:36.145
Well, looks like she fought back.

03:36.468 --> 03:40.304
She's got scratches
on her left hand here.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.583
Whoever it was,
they really gave her a beating.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.204
And left her to die
under the whole world.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.629
Lucky for us.

03:55.782 --> 03:58.433
She still had her video camera.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.869
Was it you?

04:01.815 --> 04:02.835
Are you crazy, man?

04:02.835 --> 04:04.471
Get out of our neighborhood!

04:04.471 --> 04:05.806
Hold him!

04:06.999 --> 04:08.036
Stop! Don't!
I'm taping all of you!

04:08.036 --> 04:09.172
A chainsaw?

04:09.172 --> 04:10.267
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

04:10.267 --> 04:11.523
Give me the camera.

04:13.096 --> 04:14.397
Get away from me.

04:14.397 --> 04:16.071
That's weird.

04:16.861 --> 04:19.176
Oh, wait. Freeze that.

04:19.678 --> 04:23.046
Since when do Jews care about
Mexicans taking their jobs?

04:23.046 --> 04:23.809
They don't,

04:23.809 --> 04:25.962
but they sure were upset
when they say Meena taping.

04:25.962 --> 04:27.851
They went right at her.

04:32.307 --> 04:33.830
This is all early morning.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.569
Look at the shadows.

04:36.347 --> 04:39.029
That means the timeline is off.

04:39.341 --> 04:43.304
How did she end up dead
at the Unisphere 15 hours later?

04:47.261 --> 04:48.622
Wait, hold on.

04:49.403 --> 04:50.860
Zoom in there.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.665
Savoy at Little neck.

04:55.144 --> 04:59.356
So this shape-up must be right by
the Nassau county border.

04:59.855 --> 05:01.853
Visitors welcome.

05:05.644 --> 05:07.453
Hey, fellas. Habla ingles?

05:07.453 --> 05:09.267
- Habla ingles? Habla ingles?
- Policia! Policia!

05:09.267 --> 05:10.401
Hey, hold on, hold on!

05:10.401 --> 05:11.461
Come here!

05:13.148 --> 05:14.439
It's okay.

05:19.239 --> 05:22.210
We just wanna know
who attacked you yesterday.

05:22.795 --> 05:24.357
No one.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.496
All right, look, you got nothing to
worry about with us, all right?

05:26.496 --> 05:28.596
Who had the chainsaw?

05:29.659 --> 05:31.488
It was three white boys.

05:31.488 --> 05:34.351
Two had bats,
one had a saw to my face.

05:34.351 --> 05:35.614
I could feel the breeze.

05:35.614 --> 05:38.011
- Did you recognize them?
- Not these guys.

05:38.011 --> 05:40.347
Okay, so you've been
harassed before, huh?

05:40.347 --> 05:41.554
Every day.

05:41.554 --> 05:44.293
I mean, usually they yell at us
about stealing jobs,

05:44.293 --> 05:47.301
but yesterday, these guys,
they kept yelling the baby.

05:47.301 --> 05:48.996
Who hit the baby?

05:49.527 --> 05:51.082
And how about her?

05:52.598 --> 05:54.932
Yeah. She had a camera.

05:54.932 --> 05:57.968
And they yell at her to stop.
And they ran after her.

05:57.968 --> 05:59.345
And then...

05:59.345 --> 06:01.118
and then we ran.

06:05.957 --> 06:07.332
Go ahead.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.387
"Who hit the baby?"

06:13.387 --> 06:14.459
Last Friday night,

06:14.459 --> 06:18.730
a mother and her stroller were hit by a van
full of day laborers on Northern boulevard.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.307
She was on her way to synagogue.

06:20.307 --> 06:22.687
Well, this has got to be payback.

06:22.963 --> 06:24.973
Until Meena got in the way.

06:27.351 --> 06:32.252
Some illegal alien runs over a mother
and her baby and you arrest me?

06:36.492 --> 06:38.878
You recognize this one?

06:39.575 --> 06:40.990
No.

06:42.595 --> 06:43.946
No?

06:45.064 --> 06:46.604
No.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.520
'Cause we have videotape
of you and your chainsaw buddies

06:50.520 --> 06:54.198
chasing this woman
who ends up like this.

06:57.363 --> 07:00.556
Okay, we ran after her,
but that's all we did.

07:00.556 --> 07:02.070
I mean, she was spying on us.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.288
Where'd you chase her?

07:03.288 --> 07:05.356
Through the empty lot.

07:05.356 --> 07:07.351
She fell, she got up,

07:07.351 --> 07:09.013
and then she ran towards the subway.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.181
And where did you go?

07:10.181 --> 07:12.148
To the Jewish community center.

07:12.148 --> 07:14.201
We teach Hebrew.

07:14.484 --> 07:16.067
Your rabbi gonna back you up?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.579
Of course.

07:20.212 --> 07:22.950
We didn't hurt the Mexicans
or that Arab girl.

07:22.950 --> 07:25.644
We just want these people
out of our neighborhood

07:25.644 --> 07:28.838
before they kill any more
of our children.

07:29.061 --> 07:32.230
Put your hand on the table
where I can see it.

07:34.692 --> 07:36.083
Go on.

07:39.447 --> 07:41.360
Now spread your fingers.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.593
He gave up the other two batters.
No priors on any of them.

07:57.593 --> 07:59.386
They even pay their
parking tickets on time.

07:59.386 --> 08:01.100
And their rabbi confirmed their alibi.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.319
Three upstanding racist orthodox Jews.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.226
In Queens, the most ethnically
diverse county in the country.

08:09.226 --> 08:12.206
I guess that makes them
even more xenophobic.

08:13.855 --> 08:15.484
The Unisphere.

08:15.484 --> 08:19.955
It was built to symbolize the theme
of the '64 World's fair.

08:19.955 --> 08:22.347
Peace through understanding.

08:22.347 --> 08:24.705
I spoke to Meena's college advisor.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.585
She was making a documentary
about racism in Queens.

08:27.585 --> 08:31.282
And her film partner Emily Williams
left town yesterday morning.

08:31.282 --> 08:33.563
She's on her way back now.

08:33.761 --> 08:36.922
Family's on the way to the morgue
to ID the body.

08:41.743 --> 08:44.476
Yes, that's Meena.

08:45.577 --> 08:47.653
My daughter.

08:48.659 --> 08:51.046
Look at her face.

08:51.252 --> 08:54.278
We're very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Hasni.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.595
Who would do this?

08:56.595 --> 08:59.987
We're in the process
of investigating that right now.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.141
Do you know who she was with last night?

09:03.141 --> 09:05.486
The body must be washed.

09:06.024 --> 09:08.179
Could you tell us
the last time you saw her?

09:08.179 --> 09:10.538
Yesterday, at breakfast.

09:10.538 --> 09:12.975
The funeral must happen right away!

09:12.975 --> 09:16.006
If you wouldn't mind just answering
a few questions first.

09:16.006 --> 09:17.965
How am I going to tell your mother?

09:17.965 --> 09:19.606
Not now, please.

09:19.606 --> 09:21.060
Another time.

09:26.604 --> 09:27.966
Cause of death,

09:27.966 --> 09:30.930
a contracue injury to the brain.

09:31.342 --> 09:33.188
Explain that to my partner.

09:33.188 --> 09:35.225
I'll listen too.

09:35.734 --> 09:38.654
All right, her head hit the ground.

09:38.654 --> 09:41.308
Her brain smacked against
the back of her skull,

09:41.308 --> 09:42.315
which fractured.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.199
Then the brain rebounded

09:44.199 --> 09:46.648
and collided with the front of her skull.
Contracue.

09:46.648 --> 09:49.054
- Oh, got it.
- Yeah.

09:49.054 --> 09:52.148
You see this with rollerbladers
who don't wear helmets.

09:52.148 --> 09:54.871
You hit your head like that,
don't get to a neurosurgeon in ten minutes,

09:54.871 --> 09:56.217
you're an organ donor.

09:56.217 --> 09:59.945
Uh, Rodgers, what about
these bruises on her face?

09:59.945 --> 10:02.434
Not enough impact to kill her.

10:02.434 --> 10:06.379
But I did find pieces of concrete
in her cheeks, nose.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.451
So she falls backwards,

10:08.451 --> 10:11.529
gets a hematoma that'll kill her.
But her attacker doesn't know that,

10:11.529 --> 10:13.590
so he turns her around.

10:13.590 --> 10:15.808
Bashes her face into the ground.

10:15.808 --> 10:18.783
- That's a lot of rage.
- Yeah.

10:19.136 --> 10:21.034
One more thing.

10:21.034 --> 10:23.184
She was seven weeks pregnant.

10:28.096 --> 10:30.174
I saw Meena yesterday.

10:30.392 --> 10:34.287
I was her family counselor,
but that's all I can say about it.

10:34.287 --> 10:36.586
You know someone killed her last night.

10:36.586 --> 10:40.030
I know. I'm sorry, but it's supposed
to be kept confidential.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.722
Oh, look. Okay, miss,

10:41.722 --> 10:43.941
Meena was Pakistani and Muslim.

10:43.941 --> 10:45.311
We make one call to the feds,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.441
they can invoke the Patriot act,
get all the records.

10:47.441 --> 10:49.122
Now, I don't wanna go that route,

10:49.122 --> 10:50.831
but I will.

10:51.131 --> 10:54.017
Geez. Okay.

10:54.017 --> 10:56.984
She came in with her boyfriend
and it was tense.

10:56.984 --> 10:58.032
What was his name?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.767
Uh, Rudi Ventano.

10:59.767 --> 11:00.570
He was pushy.

11:00.570 --> 11:03.276
She wanted to discuss options
and he kind of flipped.

11:03.276 --> 11:06.442
Meaning he wanted her
to get an abortion.

11:06.442 --> 11:08.966
No, that wasn't it at all.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.090
I wanted Meena to have the baby.

11:12.090 --> 11:13.753
But she didn't want to?

11:13.753 --> 11:15.076
We'd have worked it out.

11:15.076 --> 11:16.168
I loved her.

11:16.168 --> 11:18.937
I wanted her to move in with me,
get married, everything.

11:18.937 --> 11:20.551
When did you see her last?

11:20.551 --> 11:22.900
The night before.
We spent it together.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.057
Rudy, Meena had breakfast
with her family.

11:26.676 --> 11:28.462
Look, she always did that, okay?

11:28.462 --> 11:30.735
She'd sneak home
before they woke up.

11:30.735 --> 11:32.684
They didn't know about you?

11:32.684 --> 11:33.882
They didn't approve.

11:33.882 --> 11:35.315
It was the religion thing.

11:35.315 --> 11:38.144
So you're sure that's
the last time you saw her.

11:40.502 --> 11:43.829
That's not what they told us
at the clinic, Rudy.

11:44.827 --> 11:49.818
Yeah, I saw her yesterday afternoon.
Like I said, nothing was resolved.

11:51.494 --> 11:52.696
Okay.

11:52.941 --> 11:55.008
By the way, what happened to your hand?

11:56.146 --> 11:58.122
I was doing construction.

12:01.104 --> 12:03.029
Listen to your uncle, Joseph.

12:03.029 --> 12:04.331
You got nothing to worry about!

12:04.331 --> 12:05.904
What if someone saw me?

12:05.904 --> 12:07.862
They'd have taken you in.

12:07.862 --> 12:10.503
Look, if they want
to talk to you again,

12:10.503 --> 12:12.350
what were you doing?

12:13.290 --> 12:14.828
I was with you,
watching the Knicks.

12:14.828 --> 12:17.053
- Perfect!
- And afterwards?

12:17.053 --> 12:19.646
Nobody needs to know about that.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.128
Look, you were sleeping down here,
I went upstairs.

12:24.128 --> 12:25.532
Got it?

12:28.572 --> 12:32.273
You mother said she was trouble, Rudy,
from day one.

12:33.388 --> 12:36.279
Rudy, she's gone now.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.033
Meena didn't have a boyfriend,
she was a good girl.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.473
Very studious.

12:48.473 --> 12:50.771
Rudy Ventano said they were in love.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.665
What? What nonsense.

12:56.706 --> 13:01.580
I told my daughter stay away
from those people. They're thugs.

13:01.807 --> 13:04.657
In the mafia.
They hate us.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.564
The mafia?

13:07.748 --> 13:10.069
Are you talking about Italians?

13:10.069 --> 13:11.446
You have dark skin and an accent,

13:11.446 --> 13:13.048
they'd beat you to death
as soon as look at you.

13:13.048 --> 13:14.961
Rudy was one of them.

13:18.466 --> 13:20.543
Your daughter had many friends.

13:20.543 --> 13:22.083
Classmates.

13:22.083 --> 13:26.008
Our daughter studied very hard.
She didn't have time to date.

13:26.008 --> 13:29.441
Then why did Rudy say that he
and Meena were getting married?

13:29.753 --> 13:31.669
'Cause he's a liar.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.495
Mr. and Mrs. Hasni, this is difficult,

13:37.495 --> 13:40.730
but we need to tell you,
Meena was pregnant.

13:42.218 --> 13:43.097
No.

13:43.097 --> 13:44.525
That's impossible.

13:44.525 --> 13:46.805
Meena was promised to Tariq.

13:46.805 --> 13:48.096
Who is Tariq?

13:48.096 --> 13:51.163
Tariq Amir from Lahore.

13:51.344 --> 13:54.765
Our family and the Amir family,
we had an agreement.

13:54.765 --> 13:57.220
Tariq came here two weeks ago
and enrolled at Queensboro.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.529
They were supposed to marry.

13:58.529 --> 14:00.557
Then move back together to Pakistan.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.882
Meena agreed to that,
an arranged marriage?

14:02.882 --> 14:04.573
Those were the wishes of her family.

14:04.573 --> 14:05.862
She must have told Rudy.

14:05.862 --> 14:07.668
Maybe he got angry.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.802
My child. My child.

14:10.802 --> 14:14.308
My child and my grandchild.

14:15.937 --> 14:19.723
So, we've got one girl, two fiances.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.581
One fiance must have
found out about the other

14:21.581 --> 14:23.219
and taken it out on Meena.

14:23.219 --> 14:24.880
And her family blames the Italian.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.708
When they admit he exists.
They're in denial.

14:27.708 --> 14:30.590
They actually believe she was going
to accept an arranged marriage.

14:30.590 --> 14:33.603
A 19-year-old college student born here.

14:33.603 --> 14:35.691
From a radically different culture

14:35.691 --> 14:38.519
where the parents' judgment is absolute.

14:38.841 --> 14:41.509
Anyone you can talk to
outside of her family?

14:41.509 --> 14:44.303
Her documentary partner, Emily Williams.

14:45.567 --> 14:48.041
This is the Jewel of Punjab,

14:48.041 --> 14:51.088
the restaurant
my parents owned until 9/11,

14:51.088 --> 14:53.162
when everything changed.

14:53.162 --> 14:55.523
And everyone stopped coming.

15:00.393 --> 15:04.085
Now they work here
with my brother Dani.

15:04.313 --> 15:08.150
He had to drop out of college
to help the family.

15:10.746 --> 15:13.455
When our customers shunned
the restaurant, we came here.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.357
And we all live
in a small apartment on top.

15:22.311 --> 15:25.073
What did Meena's parents
say about the documentary?

15:25.073 --> 15:26.731
They never saw it.

15:26.731 --> 15:29.312
It won the student film award last year,

15:29.312 --> 15:30.690
and they weren't interested.

15:30.690 --> 15:34.488
Meena and her parents weren't on the same
page about her life, her studies?

15:34.488 --> 15:37.125
Yeah, 'cause Meena wanted a life.

15:37.125 --> 15:40.666
Her family's friends called her an ABCD.

15:40.666 --> 15:43.931
American born confused Dessie.

15:43.931 --> 15:47.165
A Dessie's someone from southern Asia.

15:47.165 --> 15:50.249
Meena was split
between the two worlds.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.084
So she argued with her family?

15:52.084 --> 15:53.091
No.

15:53.091 --> 15:55.109
She was too respectful.

15:55.109 --> 15:58.190
Was she really going along
with an arranged marriage?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.513
No.

15:59.732 --> 16:01.979
She was in love with Rudy.

16:02.835 --> 16:06.679
Had you noticed any tension
between them lately?

16:08.594 --> 16:11.208
We know about her pregnancy.

16:12.212 --> 16:15.209
Look, she loved Rudy.

16:15.209 --> 16:18.158
But she wasn't ready to move
into his mom's basement

16:18.158 --> 16:19.848
and start a family.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.574
His mom's basement?
That was his plan?

16:22.574 --> 16:25.941
Yeah, but she said that was as bad
as what her parents wanted.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.752
So she decided to have an abortion.

16:29.611 --> 16:33.420
She made up her mind
when she got back from the clinic.

16:36.091 --> 16:38.742
I was gonna go with her next week.

16:40.213 --> 16:42.037
That's a lie.
We loved each other.

16:42.037 --> 16:43.204
Meena may have loved you, Rudy,

16:43.204 --> 16:46.286
but she wasn't ready to be barefoot,
pregnant, and in your basement.

16:46.286 --> 16:47.714
She was confused, okay?

16:47.714 --> 16:49.304
She was scared.
So was I.

16:49.304 --> 16:52.178
You're saying Meena loved you,
but she didn't tell you?

16:56.342 --> 16:58.606
You wanna be a little
careful here, Rudy,

16:58.606 --> 17:02.872
'cause you've already lied to us once
and you're not very good at it.

17:04.781 --> 17:08.023
Okay, she told me.

17:08.023 --> 17:09.356
Later that night.

17:09.356 --> 17:11.013
The night she was killed?

17:11.013 --> 17:14.094
That's when she told you
she'd scheduled an abortion?

17:14.328 --> 17:18.071
Was there any reason you didn't
tell us this before, Rudy?

17:20.442 --> 17:22.934
Now tell us the whole story.

17:23.778 --> 17:27.522
We went for a walk at the Unisphere.

17:28.731 --> 17:30.712
She was crying.

17:30.712 --> 17:33.387
I was upset.
We were stressed.

17:33.973 --> 17:36.534
We kind of went at it.

17:37.313 --> 17:40.337
And I did the worst thing
I ever did in my life.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.300
What was that?

17:43.300 --> 17:46.698
I left her in the park alone.

17:49.921 --> 17:51.749
What time was that?

17:52.166 --> 17:54.759
10, 10:30.

17:54.966 --> 17:57.126
And then where did you go?

17:58.025 --> 17:59.866
I went home.

17:59.866 --> 18:03.001
I spent the rest of the night
with my uncle Joseph.

18:04.796 --> 18:07.580
If I could just take it back...

18:08.409 --> 18:10.594
Leaving her there.

18:12.101 --> 18:14.579
I'd do anything.

18:17.649 --> 18:20.182
Well, he seems genuinely upset.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.795
He has a lot of guilt.

18:21.993 --> 18:24.051
Yeah, he left his girlfriend to die.

18:24.051 --> 18:25.813
Or he killed her.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.041
Meena could have told him
she was having an abortion,

18:28.041 --> 18:30.317
he flew into a rage.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.537
I don't get that from him.

18:32.537 --> 18:34.065
He wanted to control her.

18:34.065 --> 18:35.793
Like everyone else in her life.

18:35.793 --> 18:37.830
He may have pressured her
to have their baby,

18:37.830 --> 18:38.779
but I'm with Logan.

18:38.779 --> 18:44.195
I don't see him bashing her skull in
or writing 4911 in her blood.

18:44.195 --> 18:45.869
You wanna street him?

18:45.869 --> 18:49.436
Sure. He'll just run home to mama
if we need him.

18:49.436 --> 18:51.729
In the meantime,
talk to his uncle.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.445
If Rudy has any idea
who killed Meena,

18:53.445 --> 18:55.788
he'll tell his uncle
before he'd tell us.

18:59.182 --> 19:01.624
We should call my cousin Vera, okay?

19:01.624 --> 19:03.548
She's an attorney,
she'll help you.

19:03.548 --> 19:04.921
She's a paralegal, ma.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.773
- And I don't need a lawyer, okay?
- Where are you going?

19:06.773 --> 19:09.351
- Don't go anywhere.
- Look, I have to talk to them, okay?

19:09.351 --> 19:12.065
Explain what happened before the cops
tell them I was with her.

19:12.065 --> 19:14.206
Don't be crazy. Talk?

19:14.206 --> 19:15.357
To those Arabs?

19:15.357 --> 19:17.324
What? Pakistanis.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.747
Not Arabs!

19:18.747 --> 19:20.761
How many times I gotta tell you?

19:32.506 --> 19:34.654
Yeah, my Rudy.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.091
He was in love with that girl.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.528
She was gonna move in
with him down here.

19:43.003 --> 19:44.791
He built a room for the baby?

19:44.791 --> 19:46.571
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

19:47.949 --> 19:50.261
And who put the hole in the wall?

19:50.261 --> 19:51.762
Rudy.

19:52.603 --> 19:54.380
When he found out
she was killed, bam,

19:54.380 --> 19:56.146
he went ballistic.

19:56.146 --> 19:57.820
So your son has a temper.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.319
Oh, Joseph, basta.

20:00.319 --> 20:02.931
No, my son, he had nothing
to do with this girl's death.

20:02.931 --> 20:04.579
Cecilia, please.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.493
Don't start in with me, Joseph.

20:06.493 --> 20:08.009
I know what happened, all right?

20:08.009 --> 20:11.194
Mrs. Ventano, Rudy saw Meena
the night she was killed.

20:11.194 --> 20:14.031
Whoa, whoa, and he left her alive.

20:14.031 --> 20:16.082
He spent the night here with me.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.048
What were you two doing?

20:18.400 --> 20:19.943
We were watching the game.

20:19.943 --> 20:22.003
Yeah, the Knicks.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.360
Oh, yeah.

20:23.643 --> 20:26.023
You remember the final score?

20:26.330 --> 20:28.631
It was memorable.

20:28.631 --> 20:30.469
The Knicks won.

20:30.469 --> 20:31.713
Double overtime.

20:31.713 --> 20:33.144
He was here.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.547
You should be talking to her family!

20:35.547 --> 20:37.879
Those people, those Muslims,

20:37.879 --> 20:40.297
they're killing each other all the time!

20:40.297 --> 20:42.279
The bombs,
cutting each other's heads off.

20:42.279 --> 20:43.885
They're like animals, those people.

20:43.885 --> 20:45.291
Mrs. Ventano.

20:46.095 --> 20:48.737
This isn't a terrorist attack,
it's a homicide.

20:48.737 --> 20:51.149
I apologize for my sister.

20:51.149 --> 20:54.251
Don't you apologize for me.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.561
Why are you bothering us?

20:57.561 --> 20:59.345
Why don't you go talk to those Arabs?

20:59.345 --> 21:02.168
'Cause god only knows
what they've doing to him.

21:03.425 --> 21:05.965
What they're doing to him?

21:06.810 --> 21:09.597
Are you saying that
your son went over there?

21:10.597 --> 21:15.149
He left an hour ago.
I begged him not to go.

21:15.149 --> 21:19.027
He said he needed to let them know
that he was innocent.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.255
Let's go.

21:22.308 --> 21:23.853
Listen, Meena loved me.

21:23.853 --> 21:25.479
- You killed my sister.
- No, man.

21:25.479 --> 21:26.784
- Get out! Leave us alone.
- Hey, watch it, man.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.323
Think you can come in here,
threatening us?

21:28.323 --> 21:29.458
Back off!

21:31.127 --> 21:33.213
Hey! What is going on?

21:35.145 --> 21:37.383
Look, I just need to explain, okay?

21:37.383 --> 21:40.273
- You get out!
- This is what you people do.

21:40.273 --> 21:41.304
Oh, man.

21:41.304 --> 21:43.818
- Get off me!
- Look, just take it easy.

21:48.121 --> 21:49.541
What the hell are you doing?

21:51.118 --> 21:52.699
Just drop the gun.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.072
Dani!

22:07.168 --> 22:08.614
Kazi, no!

22:08.614 --> 22:09.620
Savia!

22:20.038 --> 22:21.141
Drop that gun!

22:21.141 --> 22:22.400
Drop it!

22:39.072 --> 22:40.852
Rudy just showed up,
threatening me.

22:40.852 --> 22:42.597
Telling me to keep my mouth shut.

22:42.597 --> 22:43.401
About what?

22:43.401 --> 22:45.092
That Meena was breaking up with him.

22:45.092 --> 22:46.422
He told me not to tell the police.

22:46.422 --> 22:49.144
I said I would say whatever I wanted
and he jumped me.

22:49.144 --> 22:51.852
- And then your father came in.
- Yeah.

22:53.361 --> 22:56.263
Please, my husband
is not a violent man.

22:56.263 --> 22:58.367
I know he doesn't
have a license for the gun.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.336
Well, after 9/11, we needed it.

23:00.336 --> 23:02.225
Just to scare them.

23:02.225 --> 23:04.513
They attacked our restaurant.

23:04.733 --> 23:07.460
He would never hurt anyone.
He never even used it.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.481
Until tonight.

23:09.952 --> 23:11.736
This is America?

23:11.909 --> 23:13.017
I'm a citizen.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.337
Don't I have the right
to protect my family?

23:15.337 --> 23:17.507
Mr. Hasni, you have a right
to remain silent.

23:17.507 --> 23:19.276
We're bringing you
down to the station.

23:19.276 --> 23:22.176
He came at me and my son!

23:22.376 --> 23:24.384
You're under arrest, Mr. Hasni.

23:24.384 --> 23:25.209
Let's go.

23:25.209 --> 23:26.719
No, please. Kazi!

23:26.719 --> 23:27.881
Papa!

23:31.020 --> 23:32.125
Kazi!

23:32.977 --> 23:34.981
Why, why are you doing this?

23:34.981 --> 23:35.677
Kazi!

23:35.677 --> 23:37.536
Ma'am, stand back.

23:37.536 --> 23:38.705
Go ahead.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.070
My father was protecting us!

23:42.070 --> 23:43.627
You see what they do to him?

23:43.627 --> 23:46.911
Let him go! Let him go!

23:46.911 --> 23:48.676
Let him go!

23:49.855 --> 23:52.598
Listen, I do not care
how tragic this is.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.076
If you try to incite a riot,

23:54.076 --> 23:56.128
I'm gonna throw your ass in jail!

23:56.128 --> 23:57.499
You understand me?

23:57.499 --> 23:59.258
Now, cool it!

24:05.284 --> 24:06.532
Okay, folks. Get us out.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.742
Let's go. Go inside, please.

24:11.886 --> 24:14.144
No, please.
I want my boy.

24:14.144 --> 24:15.393
Why?

24:15.608 --> 24:18.936
- There was nothing we could do.
- Get your hands off me!

24:23.963 --> 24:25.277
Oh, god.

24:27.435 --> 24:29.826
We're very sorry for your loss.

24:32.049 --> 24:33.971
I told him.

24:34.333 --> 24:38.756
I told him that family
was gonna kill him.

24:39.910 --> 24:43.848
And those monsters killed him.

24:47.868 --> 24:50.370
Charges just went up
from attempted murder to murder.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.041
Mr. Hasni was just arranged.

24:52.041 --> 24:55.422
The public defender claimed
defense of self and others.

24:55.422 --> 24:57.499
We'll see what a jury says.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.660
So we still don't know
who killed Meena,

25:00.660 --> 25:03.679
but now we have two families
locked in a tribal war.

25:03.679 --> 25:07.877
Post a car outside the Ventano home
and the Hasni home.

25:10.633 --> 25:11.737
What?

25:11.737 --> 25:13.334
- Trouble?
- Too late.

25:13.334 --> 25:16.766
The precinct reports a 10-31
at the Hasni family store.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.316
The car's en route.

25:37.925 --> 25:40.455
Why is he refusing your lawyer?

25:40.674 --> 25:42.738
He's very emotional right now.

25:42.738 --> 25:45.637
He probably shouldn't be
talking to anybody.

25:48.517 --> 25:50.763
What is she doing here?

25:50.992 --> 25:52.527
- Oh!
- Oh, hey!

25:52.527 --> 25:54.751
- My son is dead 'cause of you!
- All right, that's enough.

25:54.751 --> 25:56.101
- That's enough. Hey!
- I'm so sorry.

25:56.101 --> 25:57.991
You're sorry?
You killed my son!

25:57.991 --> 25:59.727
You killed my boy!

25:59.727 --> 26:01.115
Your son, my daughter.

26:01.115 --> 26:02.422
Your whore daughter.

26:02.422 --> 26:04.100
You terrorist bitch!

26:04.100 --> 26:06.263
You've had enough. Let's go.

26:08.363 --> 26:10.976
I'm the only father he had.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.125
I never married.

26:14.125 --> 26:18.222
I worked as a doorman for 30 years
so he wouldn't have to.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.545
All for nothing.

26:20.545 --> 26:23.383
Did Rudy want to marry Meena?

26:23.688 --> 26:25.893
Yeah, yeah.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.912
My sister doesn't
need to know the truth, okay?

26:31.912 --> 26:33.716
I don't want her to know.

26:33.716 --> 26:36.055
What is the truth?

26:38.451 --> 26:40.190
What does it matter, huh?

26:40.190 --> 26:41.834
He's gone!

26:42.081 --> 26:45.735
You gonna let him take the rap
for killing the one person he loved?

26:46.632 --> 26:48.144
Come on, Joseph.

26:48.144 --> 26:51.408
It's time for you to tell us
what he was doing that night.

26:52.082 --> 26:55.723
And this time, the truth.

26:57.890 --> 26:59.755
Okay.

27:01.742 --> 27:05.565
He came home close to 11 o'clock.

27:05.565 --> 27:08.928
They had a big fight over the baby.

27:09.633 --> 27:11.476
And?

27:11.805 --> 27:14.485
Oh, no.

27:14.485 --> 27:15.917
And stupid me,

27:15.917 --> 27:19.807
what do I know? I mean, I wanted
to make him feel better.

27:19.807 --> 27:21.689
So I...

27:31.635 --> 27:34.345
I took him to a cathouse.

27:41.914 --> 27:44.086
Write down the address.

27:47.419 --> 27:49.071
We didn't come here to arrest you.

27:49.071 --> 27:50.802
We just wanna talk to you
about this guy.

27:50.802 --> 27:53.690
His name is Ventano. Rudy.

27:53.690 --> 27:56.096
Might have used a different name.

27:59.763 --> 28:01.865
He used his real name.

28:01.865 --> 28:05.396
Tuesday night,
arrived 11 with his uncle.

28:05.396 --> 28:08.313
They had drinks,
came in here with me at 12.

28:08.313 --> 28:09.509
For how long?

28:09.509 --> 28:11.852
Friendly uncle paid for an hour.

28:12.071 --> 28:15.635
Did you notice if the younger guy
had any bruises or scratches on him?

28:15.635 --> 28:17.086
We didn't get that far.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.234
He wouldn't even let me touch.

28:19.234 --> 28:20.166
Why not?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.724
He just cried the whole time.

28:22.724 --> 28:23.723
About?

28:23.723 --> 28:26.411
His girlfriend didn't
want to have his baby.

28:26.411 --> 28:27.872
Not what I usually hear.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.992
She's lucky to have him.

28:29.992 --> 28:32.316
Yeah, well, her luck ran out.

28:35.453 --> 28:38.278
What does your "hooker intuition" say?

28:38.473 --> 28:40.206
Hooker intuition?

28:40.602 --> 28:43.234
I didn't even know
they were using Blackberries.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.461
She's got no reason to lie.

28:47.461 --> 28:48.591
If Rudy didn't do it,

28:48.591 --> 28:50.771
we're back to Tariq, the spurned suitor.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.445
Boat ticket. Take it.

28:56.795 --> 28:59.471
Why not just fly home?

29:00.483 --> 29:03.209
They are looking for you, Tariq.

29:05.187 --> 29:07.002
Then I should hide.

29:07.002 --> 29:08.780
You'll end up in prison.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.387
You have any idea
how Americans would treat you?

29:10.387 --> 29:12.541
The police, the criminals, the guards?

29:12.541 --> 29:15.035
You've seen what they do.

29:29.508 --> 29:30.876
Rudy didn't kill Meena.

29:30.876 --> 29:32.815
They had a fight in the park,
he left her there.

29:32.815 --> 29:34.538
His uncle took him to a brothel.

29:34.538 --> 29:37.522
And he didn't sleep with the hooker,
he just cried about Meena.

29:37.522 --> 29:39.565
Does Meena's father know?

29:40.026 --> 29:41.441
Not yet.

29:41.441 --> 29:44.263
He's in Rikers.
Hasn't posted bail yet.

29:44.263 --> 29:45.898
Next time you see Mr. Hasni,

29:45.898 --> 29:48.493
let him know the kid he killed
loved his daughter.

29:48.493 --> 29:49.472
Thank you.

29:49.472 --> 29:50.944
That was the INS.

29:50.944 --> 29:52.794
The fiance Tariq Amir,

29:52.794 --> 29:55.683
they picked him up last night
trying to board a freighter.

29:55.683 --> 29:57.843
Will wonders never cease.

30:04.905 --> 30:09.556
Meena Hasni, I barely knew her.

30:11.064 --> 30:12.428
You were gonna marry her, weren't you?

30:12.428 --> 30:13.859
Of course.

30:13.859 --> 30:15.336
That's why I came here.

30:15.336 --> 30:18.953
Yeah, but she didn't want
anything to do with you, right?

30:19.298 --> 30:22.266
Her family couldn't control her.

30:22.266 --> 30:23.972
Yeah, that's what I said.

30:24.172 --> 30:25.405
She didn't want
anything to do with you.

30:25.405 --> 30:26.625
No!

30:27.725 --> 30:30.447
She wasn't pure.

30:30.647 --> 30:33.516
And in your eyes, that's a disgrace.

30:34.224 --> 30:36.781
Is that why you killed her?

30:36.781 --> 30:39.189
Why would I kill her?

30:39.189 --> 30:43.926
Not worth wasting a bullet
or dulling a knife.

30:43.926 --> 30:47.502
I told her father she was a whore.

30:48.474 --> 30:50.334
Nice.

30:51.507 --> 30:53.369
Where were you Tuesday night?

30:53.369 --> 30:55.287
At a restaurant.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.879
Here's the receipt.

31:08.924 --> 31:13.765
This is a strip club, Mr. Amir.

31:15.857 --> 31:17.888
Was it a pure one?

31:19.809 --> 31:22.975
Okay, her parents didn't do a great job
picking out a husband for her.

31:22.975 --> 31:25.526
But if his alibi checks,
we're back to square one.

31:25.526 --> 31:26.542
Maybe not.

31:26.542 --> 31:28.999
Meena's family said she'd
agreed to the marriage.

31:28.999 --> 31:31.268
They were ashamed to tell us the truth.

31:31.268 --> 31:36.687
Imagine the shame when Tariq told Kazi
his daughter was a whore.

31:37.317 --> 31:39.826
Maybe Kazi tried to bring her to heel.

31:39.826 --> 31:41.597
An honor killing.

31:41.915 --> 31:43.618
In New York?

31:43.618 --> 31:46.872
A lot of women in a lot of countries
have been killed for less.

31:46.872 --> 31:49.513
The thing is, Mr. Hasni.

31:49.513 --> 31:51.966
Rudy didn't kill your daughter.

31:51.966 --> 31:53.710
I saw him.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.164
I saw his temper.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.554
You didn't see the way
he went after my boy.

31:57.554 --> 31:59.523
Turns out he had an alibi.

31:59.523 --> 32:00.709
He was with someone else.

32:00.709 --> 32:02.192
It can't be.

32:04.008 --> 32:06.494
This family, they tell lies for him.

32:06.494 --> 32:09.569
No. We checked, Mr. Hasni.

32:09.796 --> 32:11.530
We're sure of it.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.642
The boy was innocent?

32:18.863 --> 32:20.991
What have I done?

32:22.786 --> 32:24.982
She...

32:24.982 --> 32:27.403
broke my heart.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.243
America...

32:29.467 --> 32:30.946
I came here 25 years ago.

32:30.946 --> 32:34.057
I thought my children
would have a better life.

32:34.334 --> 32:36.524
And in one day,

32:37.585 --> 32:39.813
it all changed.

32:40.635 --> 32:43.168
I don't want my grandchildren
to grow up here now.

32:43.168 --> 32:46.398
Well, you've lost a lot in five years.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.309
Your home and your restaurant.

32:50.121 --> 32:53.206
Your daughter meets an American boy.

32:54.941 --> 32:58.379
Then she defies you
in front of Tariq.

32:58.692 --> 33:02.616
We also know that Tariq
didn't kill your daughter.

33:04.189 --> 33:07.971
He also has an alibi for that night.

33:11.114 --> 33:15.504
Which brings us to where you were
the night your daughter was killed.

33:16.717 --> 33:18.122
Mr. Hasni, as your attorney,
I would...

33:18.122 --> 33:21.277
No, no, no, no.
I want to confess.

33:23.243 --> 33:25.359
I killed my daughter.

33:25.653 --> 33:29.238
Charge me with the crime.
Write it down, I will sign it.

33:30.202 --> 33:32.611
Mr. Hasni, we can't
tell you what to say.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.399
You have to tell us what you did.

33:37.952 --> 33:39.408
Start with the park.

33:39.408 --> 33:42.025
How did you know your daughter
was even there?

33:42.025 --> 33:45.052
I followed her from home.

33:46.339 --> 33:49.303
I thought she was going
to run away with that boy.

33:49.303 --> 33:52.431
It was 10 at night.
You weren't working?

33:55.229 --> 33:59.009
I left my son and my wife in the store.

34:02.385 --> 34:05.988
And your daughter,
she was alone in the park?

34:05.988 --> 34:09.791
No, she was with that boy Rudy.

34:09.791 --> 34:11.828
They were arguing.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.603
He left.

34:13.603 --> 34:15.994
I thought now
she would listen to reason.

34:15.994 --> 34:19.672
I told her that I could fix it
so that she could still marry Tariq.

34:19.672 --> 34:22.112
But she refused.

34:22.112 --> 34:24.150
And then you got into a fight.

34:24.150 --> 34:25.501
Yes.

34:25.791 --> 34:28.496
We were angry.

34:28.496 --> 34:31.119
And people didn't hear you?

34:37.621 --> 34:41.496
They probably couldn't hear you
'cause the fountain was on.

34:41.938 --> 34:43.465
Yes.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.879
Yes, that's right.

34:50.558 --> 34:52.612
Go on.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.632
I...

34:55.061 --> 34:57.309
I pushed her. Hard.

34:57.309 --> 34:58.827
She fell.

34:58.827 --> 35:01.031
She was bleeding.

35:01.894 --> 35:05.284
And I left her there to...

35:05.284 --> 35:08.579
die.
That is what happened.

35:13.353 --> 35:14.515
He's obviously lying.

35:14.515 --> 35:16.408
The fountain's emptied in October.

35:16.408 --> 35:19.059
Yeah, the million-dollar question is,

35:19.059 --> 35:20.934
who's he protecting?

35:22.397 --> 35:24.437
This was our beautiful home

35:24.437 --> 35:28.686
before we had to move
to the apartment above the store.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.747
Her first movie.

35:31.747 --> 35:33.974
It was about our family?

35:34.420 --> 35:36.349
You never saw it?

35:36.349 --> 35:39.535
No, my husband didn't want to.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.845
This is my mother and father
on their wedding anniversary.

35:45.144 --> 35:48.561
Their marriage was arranged
for them 22 years ago.

35:48.561 --> 35:51.219
I believe they love each other very much.

35:51.219 --> 35:54.200
But I've never seen them kiss.

35:54.446 --> 35:57.848
They just work all the time.

35:59.214 --> 36:03.528
This is my boyfriend Rudy.
I've never seen him work.

36:28.081 --> 36:30.548
Why are you showing me this?

36:32.108 --> 36:34.593
So that you can see what she saw.

36:34.802 --> 36:36.284
That he loved her.

36:37.758 --> 36:40.066
- Yes, I know.
- He didn't hurt her.

36:40.066 --> 36:41.885
I understand.

36:41.885 --> 36:45.463
And Meena was right,
you love your husband, don't you?

36:45.463 --> 36:47.522
Very much.

36:48.596 --> 36:51.450
Where was he the night
Meena was killed?

36:51.450 --> 36:53.818
In the store with me.

36:53.818 --> 36:56.728
And where was your son?

37:00.028 --> 37:04.063
Zaphir, we think one of them
may have been in the park that night.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.230
No.

37:06.230 --> 37:09.950
Your husband said it was him.
He confessed to the murder.

37:09.950 --> 37:11.709
No, no, that's not true.

37:11.709 --> 37:14.070
He was with me all night.

37:14.070 --> 37:17.817
Then he shouldn't spend his life in jail
for a crime he didn't commit.

37:17.817 --> 37:20.669
There would be no honor in that.

37:21.150 --> 37:23.182
What do you mean?

37:23.383 --> 37:25.698
Someone needs to speak up
for you daughter.

37:25.698 --> 37:28.483
Who can do that better than you?

37:35.194 --> 37:38.430
I want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

37:39.775 --> 37:43.475
But my parents,
they'll never understand.

37:45.059 --> 37:47.753
She was just starting her life.

37:49.063 --> 37:51.577
Someone took it from her.

37:53.842 --> 37:56.458
If I tell you who killed my daughter,

37:56.458 --> 37:59.454
will you have mercy on my husband?

38:10.695 --> 38:14.037
I was over there by those trees.

38:14.246 --> 38:17.725
And Rudy and Meena were here,
fighting.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.619
About what?

38:19.619 --> 38:21.420
I couldn't hear her,
but he was angry.

38:21.420 --> 38:22.565
Your father was with you?

38:22.565 --> 38:25.605
No, I was alone.
So you can let him go.

38:25.605 --> 38:27.694
No, Dani, that's not enough.
He already confessed.

38:27.694 --> 38:29.097
What you said doesn't prove anything.

38:29.097 --> 38:30.371
My father is lying.

38:30.371 --> 38:31.951
How do we know that?

38:31.951 --> 38:33.342
I mean, we're trying
to get to the truth here,

38:33.342 --> 38:35.057
but you're gonna have to help us.

38:35.057 --> 38:36.947
Otherwise, you know, we're gone.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.492
And then your father's finished.

38:38.492 --> 38:40.438
I'm telling you, I saw it.
The whole thing.

38:40.438 --> 38:43.028
I saw Rudy kill her.

38:43.518 --> 38:46.604
Specifically what did you see?

38:46.604 --> 38:48.076
I was over there.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.015
And they were here arguing.

38:50.015 --> 38:51.766
He pushed her.

38:52.473 --> 38:56.124
So you saw all that
from over there in the dark.

38:56.124 --> 39:00.349
I kept moving closer.
I ended up over there.

39:00.983 --> 39:02.524
Why were you even in the park?

39:02.524 --> 39:03.989
I followed her to protect her.

39:03.989 --> 39:05.399
Then why didn't
you stop the fighting?

39:05.399 --> 39:06.687
'cause he moved too fast.

39:06.687 --> 39:08.971
He shoved her down, hard.
That was it.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.977
He pushed her from the front
or the back?

39:13.201 --> 39:16.285
We know the right answer
from the autopsy.

39:16.832 --> 39:20.317
Show us what happened
and use detective Wheeler here.

39:22.105 --> 39:24.336
Go ahead, you won't hurt me.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.155
That's it?

39:33.793 --> 39:35.561
She didn't fight back?

39:35.561 --> 39:37.018
No.

39:37.755 --> 39:40.207
She was surprised.

39:40.524 --> 39:41.918
He pushed her harder than that.

39:41.918 --> 39:44.242
Meena fell to the ground
and hit the back of her head.

39:44.242 --> 39:46.798
How hard? Show me.

39:58.481 --> 40:00.184
Then what?

40:01.185 --> 40:02.906
He, uh...

40:04.437 --> 40:06.691
he got down next to her.

40:09.201 --> 40:10.755
And...

40:11.610 --> 40:13.848
he turned her around.

40:15.071 --> 40:17.535
Why did he do that?

40:18.029 --> 40:20.798
'cause he can't
bear to look at her.

40:21.713 --> 40:23.802
Go on.

40:25.047 --> 40:29.897
He grabs the back of her head.

40:30.288 --> 40:31.961
How, Dani?

40:51.583 --> 40:54.466
He bashes her face
against the concrete.

40:54.466 --> 40:56.646
Until she's dead!

40:58.006 --> 41:00.484
And his family is saved.

41:05.889 --> 41:08.136
Why, Dani?

41:10.481 --> 41:12.904
'cause she wouldn't marry Tariq.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.558
The one thing they asked her to do.

41:14.558 --> 41:16.337
I had to do everything they asked.

41:16.337 --> 41:19.105
I gave up college, my future.

41:19.105 --> 41:20.464
To honor them.

41:20.464 --> 41:23.511
And you shame them?

41:23.787 --> 41:25.764
You defied papa?

41:25.764 --> 41:28.431
Tariq called you a whore
in front of our father.

41:28.431 --> 41:30.263
I had to.

41:30.263 --> 41:33.322
I tried to save our family
from your dishonor.

41:33.322 --> 41:35.712
I tried.

41:41.897 --> 41:43.738
Oh, my god.

41:44.915 --> 41:46.367
Oh, Meena.

41:47.426 --> 41:48.562
Meena, please.

41:48.562 --> 41:49.901
Please forgive me.

41:49.901 --> 41:51.990
Please, Meena.

41:51.990 --> 41:53.770
Please. Please forgive me.

41:53.770 --> 41:55.418
It's too late, Dani.

41:56.624 --> 41:58.331
It's too late.

41:58.562 --> 42:00.608
Put your hands behind your back.

42:01.266 --> 42:03.167
You're under arrest.

42:07.351 --> 42:08.699
Take him.
