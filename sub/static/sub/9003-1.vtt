Can I help?

06:35.770 --> 06:37.813
Yes. I hope so.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.941
I want to sell this.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.403
Uh, where'd you get this ring?

06:44.487 --> 06:47.572
It's mine.
My wife gave it to me.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.908
Look. The initials are on the inside.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.578
Yes?

06:53.663 --> 06:57.124
- "T.J.N."
- Yeah.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.126
Do you have your I.D.?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.087
I'm British.
I have a passport.

07:04.006 --> 07:08.135
- "Thomas Jerome Newton."
- The wind in the willows played

07:10.221 --> 07:14.015

- This is not a pawnshop.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.268
I beg your pardon?

07:16.352 --> 07:19.729
If I buy this ring now,
you can't redeem it later.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.773
- Understand?
- I understand.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.733

Oliver, Mr. Newton is here.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.029
I'm Oliver Farnsworth.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.455
Would you like a scotch and water
or something, Mr. Newton?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.540
Oh, a glass of water.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.460
[Man]
Fine.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.379
- Would you like a scotch?
- Yes, please.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.720
Are you all right?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.806
Just tired.

10:41.891 --> 10:47.020
I'm sorry I didn't have time to see you
at my office today, Mr. Newton.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.105
I had hardly even 10 minutes.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.107
- [Phone Rings]
- [Man] Excuse me.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.543
What's this?
Some kind of bribe?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.796
I'm paying you for your time.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.550
As from now, I want at least 10 hours
at $ 1,000 an hour.

11:19.136 --> 11:24.265
Mr. Newton, this kind of money buys
more than 10 hours even of my time.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.311
What exactly do you want?

11:28.396 --> 11:31.523
I want a lawyer
who's well versed in paten — patents.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.275
That's me.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.113
Here.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.289

11:55.631 --> 11:57.590
May I keep it overnight?

11:59.176 --> 12:01.511
I'm sorry.
I can't leave it with you.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.097
It's not that
I don't trust you.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.562
All right. I'll read it.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.821
If you want to put
a record on, Mr. Newton...

12:19.905 --> 12:21.823
music doesn't disturb me.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.159
Oh, no, thank you.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.996
Well, if there's anything
you want, just ask.

[Farnsworth]
I don't believe it.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.010
I can't believe it.
You have nine basic patents here.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.471
Nine.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.308
That's basic patents.
Do you know what that means?

14:12.393 --> 14:15.186
- [Newton] Yes, I think so.
- Do you really?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.230
I wonder.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.818
It — It means, Mr. Newton,
that you can take RCA...

14:21.902 --> 14:25.697
Eastman Kodak and DuPont,
for starters.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.701
In, say, three years,
what would this be worth to me?

14:31.495 --> 14:34.455
I'm a lawyer, not an accountant,
Mr. Newton.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.626
But I'd say it must be
something in the area of...

14:39.628 --> 14:41.671
$300 million.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.549
- Not more?
- More?

14:44.633 --> 14:47.594
- I need more.
- What the hell for?

14:49.013 --> 14:52.265
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.226
It's just I'm trying
to adjust my mind to all this.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.354
I'll offer you 10% of my net profits...

14:58.439 --> 15:00.523
plus five percent
of all corporate holdings.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.406
[Sighs]
I must think about it all.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.491
I'll ask Trevor
to take you home.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.369
I don't drive.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.166
Thank you. I have
my own driver waiting.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.127
- All night?
- If you take this assignment...

15:21.211 --> 15:24.088
you'll have complete authority,
below me.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.216
I don't want to have contact
with anyone except you.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.469
When you take this position,
Mr. Farnsworth...

15:29.553 --> 15:33.723
you'll be able to replace your antiquated
sound equipment and buy some of mine.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.225
- Buy it?
- At cost, naturally.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.354
[Darnsworth] Perhaps you're not
so different after all, Mr. Newton.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.233
Arthur, would you
please slow down?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.028
We're only doin' 45,
Mr. Newton.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.447
It's making me feel dizzy.

15:49.531 --> 15:53.242
Keep to 30, please.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.995
[Farnsworth]
My father used to say, "Oliver...

15:56.080 --> 15:59.624
"when you get a gift horse,
walk up to it...

15:59.708 --> 16:02.835
"pat it,
quiet the animal down...

16:02.920 --> 16:05.672
"and then, using both hands,
force open its jaws...

16:05.756 --> 16:08.549
and have a damned good look
in its mouth."

16:08.634 --> 16:10.551
I'd say that was
good advice.

16:10.636 --> 16:14.430
Yes. But my father
was always wrong.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.948
I just marked your paper.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.950
How'd I do?

18:39.034 --> 18:41.536
- Don't worry about it.

what they look like?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.656
I don't believe this. No.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.493
No, it's impossible.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.915
[Girl]
That one. Clever, isn't it?

21:00.842 --> 21:04.095
[Darnsworth Narrating]
It happened literally overnight.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.597
When Mr. Newton
came into my apartment...

21:06.682 --> 21:10.935
my old life went
straight out the window.

21:11.019 --> 21:15.147
In no time at all,
I got a brand-new life, and I like it.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.693
Maybe I'm not my own boss
the way I used to be...

21:18.777 --> 21:21.445
but... so what?

21:21.530 --> 21:26.492
Oliver, you're the president of
one of the largest corporations in America.

21:26.576 --> 21:30.746
[Chuckles]
I'll tell you one thing. It's never too late.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.874
I didn't think a man
could change at my age.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.253
I still can't believe it.

21:37.337 --> 21:40.631
- [Typing]
- [Darnsworth] Yes, that's possible.
We can do that.

21:40.716 --> 21:45.344
Are you sure this is
the right moment, Mr. Newton?

21:45.429 --> 21:48.097
You know, don't you,
that this one has virtually no bottom?

22:28.513 --> 22:33.434
- [Seagull Squawking]
- [Waves Crashing]

22:46.156 --> 22:48.574
No. No.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.952
I want you to begin negotiations
with Eastman Kodak immediately.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.499
[Farnsworth]
We've been together a long time now...

22:56.583 --> 23:00.336
and I don't see why you'd
even consider selling off this division.

23:03.215 --> 23:07.676
Well, I mean, if I owned
a copyright on the Bible...

23:07.761 --> 23:10.096
I wouldn't sell it
to Random House.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.727
It's what I want.
I'm on my way to New Mexico now.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.939
I shall be staying at
an hotel near the border.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.733
I can't tell you yet.
I'll be in touch.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.619
Results are results, Nate,
and your class is way below par.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.914
- [Chuckles]
- I have the computer statement right here.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.792
And, uh — [Chuckles]
It's kind of sad.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.794
The campus computer, I gather?

23:41.878 --> 23:46.048
- That damn thing doesn't have a mind.
- It's not meant to have a mind.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.343
- That's what makes it perfect for this place, right?
- [Grumbles]

23:50.429 --> 23:54.265
Oh, the company that made that self-developing
film that I showed you a while ago?

23:54.349 --> 23:56.308
They've, uh — They've made
this announcement.

23:56.393 --> 24:00.062
They're — They're dumping computers.
They're installing human beings.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.731
- Oh, really.
- Want to know why?

24:02.816 --> 24:04.775
They want to bring back
human error...

24:04.860 --> 24:08.446
because that's the way you get new ideas —
by making mistakes.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.532
Back to man and his imagination.

24:11.616 --> 24:16.287
If you can't spot a piece of bullshit
commercial publicity when you hear it...

24:16.371 --> 24:18.372
you're even more naive
than I thought.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.374
Keep your mind on yourjob.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.376
- That's my advice.
- That's your advice to me?

24:22.502 --> 24:25.713
- Yeah.
- You're so fucking smug and ignorant,
you don't know what's going on.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.715
- Oh, really?
- These kids are bored.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.468
They're bored with you
and these fucking textbooks.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.053
They're five years out of date.
I mean —

24:33.138 --> 24:36.390
[Chuckles]
What they need is some real stimulus.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.560
- Ideas to pursue.
- Yes, well...

24:39.644 --> 24:42.897
we've had enough
of your pursuits.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.692
What are you talking about?

24:46.776 --> 24:50.863
I'm talking about
the things you pursue, Nate.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.867
Young things.
I don't know. Maybe it's your age.

24:54.951 --> 24:58.996
You've become a novelty freak,
and you're not that young anymore.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.499
You don't even get it, do you?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.501
I'm younger than most of those kids.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.921
- Oh, come on!
- They're already middle-aged
because that's what they're taught.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.507
Well, I want out.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.468
- That's the fact.
- Face the facts.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.387
What the hell else
can you do now except teach?

25:16.598 --> 25:18.516
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.977
Tell you what. Why don't you go get a job
with that great company of yours?

25:22.062 --> 25:23.979
I believe I will.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.859
I believe you won't.

25:29.986 --> 25:34.657
[Country]

25:36.243 --> 25:39.495
All the boys from the South
play the guitar

25:39.579 --> 25:41.872
- Dance to town, gonna sing
- [Laughing]

25:41.957 --> 25:44.416
They stand when a lady
enters the room

25:44.501 --> 25:47.002
They won't let her do a thing

25:47.087 --> 25:50.172
All the boys from the South
went to boarding schools

25:50.257 --> 25:52.383
It didn't hurt them none

25:52.509 --> 25:56.011
- Weird-lookin' one.
- Hey. That's got a New York license number.
Shall we check it?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.055
- Yeah, might as well.
- Run an N.C.I.C.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.560
39 Artesia. Ten-four.
Request N.C.I.C. Check.

158, zebra, boy, bou.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.069
Morning. How are you this mornin'?

26:12.153 --> 26:14.363
Uh, Sussex. I have a reservation.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.532
Oh, yes, Mr. Sussex.
We've been expecting you.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.534
Room 505, please.

26:20.328 --> 26:24.164
Boy, that sure is a fancy-lookin' pen
you got there.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.208
When shall I call
for you, sir?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.086
I'm not sure.
Sometime tomorrow. I'll let you know.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.050

26:35.135 --> 26:37.428
He was born in Dixie

26:37.512 --> 26:40.973
- On a sultry summer night
- Um —

26:41.057 --> 26:43.892
No. No, I'll take that.

26:47.272 --> 26:51.108
- No, I'll take the stairs.
- It's five flights.

[Groaning]

26:54.988 --> 26:57.323

- You've got more little wrinkles.
- Mmm.

- I'm probably older than your dad.
- Probably so.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.953
That's why you tease me
so much, isn't it? Huh?

Well, I'm not
a lecherous old man.

something with your water.

finish this up and then —

I'll have another one.

about your life...

and company officials report...

37:12.021 --> 37:14.314
they know of no reason
for the sudden interest —

37:19.111 --> 37:22.280
[Nate Narrating] For a whole year
I concentrated equally on two things:

37:22.365 --> 37:24.407
Fucking and World Enterprises.

37:24.492 --> 37:28.787
It was neck and neck.
Well, I have to admit that I —

37:28.871 --> 37:32.123
It began to look like Canutti was right
because World Enterprises...

37:32.208 --> 37:37.587
was evasive and slow to reply
to my persistent letters and calls and —

37:37.672 --> 37:41.758
Suddenly, I got this letter
from Farnsworth.

37:41.842 --> 37:46.221
I'd landed a job in the research department
of the fuel division.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.223
Strangely, after that...

37:48.307 --> 37:51.184
I gradually began to lose my interest
in 18-year-olds.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.896
I don't know what happened to me.
I'm not sure.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.857
But my mind had developed
a libido of its own...

37:57.942 --> 38:02.195
and I didn't need the stimulation of legs
and so forth.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.366
The salary was terrific too.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.244
It was three times
what I'd been getting.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.746
The first thing I did
is I ordered a French car.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.541
This upset Canutti
more than anything else.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.795
Last time I remember
feeling so exhilarated...

38:18.879 --> 38:22.507
was 10 years back when I'd been
experimenting with heat photography.

38:22.591 --> 38:25.802
It came to nothing, of course,
because academia got in the way.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.804
But this time...

38:27.888 --> 38:31.224
I knew I was gonna be given
a proper chance.

38:31.309 --> 38:35.854
And you know how I knew that?
Because I had faith in myself.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.023
What I didn't know then...

was someone else

Oh, uh, not anymore.

I still keep an apartment there.

I've come to like it out here.
I think you will too.

39:33.245 --> 39:35.914
It's got a lot of...

39:36.916 --> 39:38.833
space.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.835
That means freedom.
You know what I mean?

39:40.920 --> 39:43.755
Yes, I do.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.759
Then there's the job itself.

39:47.843 --> 39:51.179
It will entail certain, uh —

39:51.263 --> 39:53.556
Uh —

39:53.641 --> 39:58.019
Well, you won't live
in quite the same way as you did before.

39:59.021 --> 40:02.065
Of course, there's the salary.

40:02.149 --> 40:06.444
- Another adjustment.
- I know this is what I want.

That's the way it should be —
no involvements, no complications.

- No danger.
- None at all.

Hello, Tommy.

40:37.226 --> 40:40.103
I got that white wine
you like from Reichman's.

40:40.187 --> 40:43.356
It's not cold.
You want me to pour you a glass?

40:44.358 --> 40:48.153
- Why not?
- [Man On TV] I suppose most girls
are sentimental about their first love.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.032
[Woman On TV]
Oh, I suppose so.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.618
Like their first pair

I don't understand how
you can watch them all at the same time.

You know, Tommy,
you're really a freak.

I don't mean that unkindly.

Everything gets so maudlin.

41:20.936 --> 41:23.438
I think people should
always behave...

41:23.522 --> 41:25.440
as though they were between planes.

41:25.524 --> 41:29.569
- Very sound, Mr. Flannagan.
- Face it.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.664

- Sound off.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.086
Hey! What the hell do you think
you're doing, you maniac?

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:22.631
All of you!

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.550
Corrected...

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.220

- [Phone Rings]
- Oh, hello.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:55.539
Mr. Farnsworth.
Yeah, it's Bryce.

01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.666
Is everything all right?

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.461
Well, uh, to tell you
the truth, I'm baffled.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:05.757
I've been here for so long, and I —
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.343
Oh, uh, and, Mr. Farnsworth,
about this, uh...

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:12.013
liquid gas problem, I —
I really must tell ya, I can't —

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:16.351
I'm afraid I know nothing about
liquid gas, Dr. Bryce.

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:21.773
What I've called to tell you is that Mr. Newton
will be visiting you the day after tomorrow.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.818
Yes. Wednesday.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:29.531
He will be able to answer
all of your questions.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.119
No, I'm afraid...
he's away at the moment.

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:37.873
Ah. Well, thanks for calling,
Mr. Farnsworth.

- Hmm?
- Mr. Newton sent me to collect you.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.038
This way, Dr. Bryce.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.422

hasn't he?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.508
Yes, sir.
He come in this mornin'.

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:18.575
Dr. Bryce? I'm Newton.

- We've met before. I —
- [Door Closes]

Mm-hmm.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.916
How are you getting on?
Have you found your feet yet?

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.586
Well, not yet.
Not — Not really.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:33.506
Well, I'm here to help you.

I believe we — we share a common interest,
Mr. Newton: Photography.

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:45.185
Hmm. My interest is energy.

Transference of energy.

01:07:48.355 --> 01:07:50.273
Oh.

01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:53.234
- Transference of energy.
- Yes.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.362
Well, I know it's gonna be very exciting
working with you. I —

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.907
I've looked forward
to meeting you.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:02.160
I've thought about you
once or twice.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:57.549
This — This is some kind
of space vehicle, right?

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.720
Well, what for?
Is it a solar probe?

01:09:04.348 --> 01:09:06.975
I want you to think
beyond that.

01:09:07.059 --> 01:09:11.270
I want to show you this
because I value your contribution to my work.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.982
Well, I'm not certain
what that's to be.

01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:16.442
Fuel conservation, Dr. Bryce.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.444
It may be the key
to our project.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:24.200
- Ask me.
- What?

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:27.370
The question you've been wanting
to ask ever since we met.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.790
Are you Lithuanian?

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.417
I come from England.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.752
Oh, that's not so terrible.

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:41.134
Is this a weapon?

01:09:41.218 --> 01:09:44.720
- A weapon?
- Well, it's too small for interplanetary travel.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.933
You assume that it's a weapon?

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.977
- Does that matter to you?
- Yeah.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.022
If I thought that you were
building a weapon...

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:58.985
you were employing me to help you,
I'd have to quit the project.

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.988
Don't be s — suspicious.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.746
I know people think me
unnecessarily secretive.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:12.665
If I were you,
I'd be secretive.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.714
Would you be
comfortable in here?

01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:24.302
I think I'd last about 20 minutes.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.304
And then?

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:29.933
I'd start screaming.
Wouldn't everyone?

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:33.561
Last night, I was watching television.
I saw these, uh, ex-astronauts.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.272
Some of them are
basket cases now.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.608
Television.

01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.736
The strange thing about
television is that it...

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.821
doesn't tell you everything.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.367
[Newton]
It shows you everything about life on Earth...

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:49.452
but the true mysteries remain.

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:52.497
Perhaps it's in
the nature of television.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.000
Just waves in space.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.586
Do you trust me, Dr. Bryce?

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.672
I think so.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:05.176
- That's not good enough.
- It's the best I can do.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.554
Let's put it this way.
Uh, I want to.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:12.433
You see, Mr. Newton, I'm kind of a cliche.
I'm the disillusioned scientist.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:16.813
That goes with the cynical writer,
the alcoholic actor and the spaced-out spaceman.

01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:19.565
A man like you wouldn't
understand a guy like me.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.069
I'll try to, Dr. Bryce.

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:25.488

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.830
That's Latin.

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:36.457
Latin?

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.668
You must know that in England.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:42.213
- Royal Air Force — their motto.
- Yes.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:47.093

[Farnsworth]
I appreciate your coming all this way to see me.

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:05.111
Would you say we're getting close
to an understanding?

01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:07.280
I'm afraid not, Mr. Peters.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:10.283
That's a pity.

01:12:11.535 --> 01:12:14.704
We seem to have spent
so much time on this question.

01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:18.624
You must understand,
World Enterprises sees itself as a loner...

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.210
a pioneer, if you will.

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:25.465
We have that get-up-and-go spirit.

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:29.385
Frankly, what you're suggesting
sounds like interference.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.806
I beg you to reconsider,
Mr. Farnsworth.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:37.810
The world is ever-changing,
like our own solar system...

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:41.647
and a corporation the size of yours
has a duty to recognize that fact.

[Faint Static]

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:46.569

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:51.866
The way I see it,
Mr. Peters, I'm way ahead.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.662
It's going to be hard.

01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:06.339
I'm concerned about
the recovery program.

01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.592

- No, I don't think so.

- With W.E. Film, what you see is what you get.

just drop it in your nearest W.E. litter bin.

It will be recycled for you.

as you can see
from a spiral band of clouds.

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:23.346
And the bright clouds
over Minnesota and lowa —

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:27.600

in western Texas, Oklahoma —

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.602

over the eastern Rockies.

and 100-mile-an-hour winds —

- Where are they?
- They live in Los Angeles.

Why aren't you with them?

01:17:57.547 --> 01:18:01.926
I'm separated from my wife,
but I see my daughter.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.137

[Man]
In these circumstances, we have to take action.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.041
Well, I talked with Farnsworth.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:38.462
- He just cannot, or will not, see it our way.
- [Chuckles]

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:43.884
The problem with this corporation
is that it is, uh, technologically overstimulated.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.220
And the economic trouble
stems from that fact.

01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:49.181
Then you must go further.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:51.684
They have to take a wider view.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:58.566
What kind of measure
would you say is appropriate?

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.193
Well, we're flexible.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:06.073
Something, uh, elastic.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:09.410
But, remember,
we're not the mafia.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:13.205
This isn't an archaic
Italian joke.

Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:36.171
