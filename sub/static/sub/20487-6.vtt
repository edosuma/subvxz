03:19.600 --> 03:23.800
The sultanate of Oman
is an absolute monarchy,

03:23.833 --> 03:25.633
a predominantly Islamic state

03:25.667 --> 03:27.833
and a vital strategic
choke point

03:27.867 --> 03:30.067
in the world's oil supply.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.700
It is surrounded by some of

tolerant,
welcoming to outsiders,

03:46.367 --> 03:50.700
peaceful,

with succession issues

03:53.533 --> 03:55.767
and declining oil reserves.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.800
The question of what's next
is a big,

03:58.833 --> 04:00.767
if often unspoken one.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.200
So, pre-1970,
this was a very different,

04:06.233 --> 04:07.700
very different place to live.

04:07.733 --> 04:08.900
Very different country.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.767
Quite simply, there was nothing.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.833
We had only three schools
all over Oman.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.333
And only for boys.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.367
We had only two hospitals.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.567
- For the whole country.
- Yes, for the whole country.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.800
And nine miles of paved road
in Muscat.

very, very quickly.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.433
Absolutely.
His Majesty took over

05:00.467 --> 05:04.133
and he changed the whole scene.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.200
This is not a democracy.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.433

He's presided over everything
Omani for the last 47 years.

From a dusty,
primitive backwater

05:33.533 --> 05:38.333
to a modern, functioning,
largely secular society.

05:38.367 --> 05:41.633
His vision was to deliver

05:41.667 --> 05:46.733
Electricity, water,
heath care, education.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.733
It was like a one man show.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.367
And usually, one man shows

Oman, it should be understood,

06:23.400 --> 06:26.400
sits at the top
of the Indian Ocean rim.

06:26.433 --> 06:30.400
The empire once stretched
from Pakistan to East Africa,

06:30.433 --> 06:32.100
with important trade routes
that reached

06:32.133 --> 06:35.133

is it's very low slung.
Yeah.

07:04.767 --> 07:09.233
It seems like a calculated,
aesthetic decision.

07:09.267 --> 07:10.760
If you're someone who wants
to build your house,

07:10.767 --> 07:13.567
you first submit your plans
to municipality.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.367

a certain height,

07:15.400 --> 07:16.800

functions in our daily life.

say, how it would've functioned

07:43.333 --> 07:46.100

and going into the Souq,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.333
say, 200 years ago.

of this all over the world.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.366
But shuwa is special.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.667

Oman, along with an elite force

Right.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.300
The war began
as a local rebellion

13:15.333 --> 13:17.733
by the Dhofari people
against the autocratic

13:17.767 --> 13:22.167
and outdated rule of then
Sultan, Said bin Taimur,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.700
who had kept his nation
isolated and stunted

13:24.733 --> 13:27.167
out of his concern
for his hold on power.

13:28.733 --> 13:30.567
What started as a local uprising

13:30.600 --> 13:32.967

full-blown,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.700
communist-backed insurgency,

13:34.733 --> 13:39.133
as Soviet and Chinese influence
poured in through Yemen.

Ian Gardner remembers
the conflict well.

alongside Omani infantry

13:48.367 --> 13:50.100
as a British Royal Marine.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.633
And later wrote about
the experience

13:51.667 --> 13:54.367
in his memoir,
"In the Service of the Sultan,"

13:54.400 --> 13:57.733
a rare chronicle of the brutal,
incredibly difficult

13:57.767 --> 14:00.467
and almost entirely unknown war,

14:00.500 --> 14:03.000
fought in the rugged
southern mountains.

14:03.033 --> 14:05.533
The old Sultan was not
an inhuman man.

14:05.567 --> 14:08.267
But he was an old man.
He was deeply reactionary.

14:08.300 --> 14:12.467
So he wanted to keep his country
in a medieval time warp.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.467
The thing that changed it
was the advent of

14:15.500 --> 14:17.800
the Japanese transistor radio.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.033
And the first time,
his people could hear

14:20.067 --> 14:22.500
what the other Arab countries
were doing with their oil.

14:22.533 --> 14:25.267
And they wanted some of that.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.733

Churchill had switched

mode of power

14:30.000 --> 14:31.367
from coal to oil.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.767
And suddenly,
everything changed.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.567
They needed oil and lots of it.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.367
