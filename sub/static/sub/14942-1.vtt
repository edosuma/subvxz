WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.333
(Brush crunching)

00:03.334 --> 00:05.205
Hello?

00:05.206 --> 00:08.039
Hello. Is anybody there?

00:10.081 --> 00:11.211
Aah!

00:11.212 --> 00:13.012
(Laughs) Dude,
I totally had you.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.314
Jerk. You almost
gave me a heart attack.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.385
Sorry I'm late.

00:15.386 --> 00:17.247
My dad almost caught
me sneaking out.

00:17.248 --> 00:18.248
(Sighs)

00:18.249 --> 00:19.249
Forgive me?

00:19.250 --> 00:20.390
(Chuckles)

00:20.391 --> 00:23.223
(Tires screeching, clattering)

00:23.224 --> 00:24.254
Oh, my god.

00:24.255 --> 00:27.097
Run!

00:27.098 --> 00:28.199
(Grunts)

00:31.362 --> 00:34.234
(People speaking indistinctly)

00:34.235 --> 00:35.265
Hi, mom.

00:35.266 --> 00:38.037
Good morning, lace.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.369
(Todd) Hey.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.211
Ugh. Sorry about
the last-minute notice.

00:41.212 --> 00:44.074
I'll be done with my deposition
in time to get her after school.

00:44.075 --> 00:46.076
It... it is no problem.
Stop apologizing. Okay.

00:46.077 --> 00:47.277
I'm just happy to be here.

00:47.278 --> 00:48.419
(Chuckles)

00:53.224 --> 00:54.224
Morning, Megan.

00:54.225 --> 00:55.425
Kate.

00:55.426 --> 00:57.157
Bye.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.259
Bye, sweetie.

01:00.331 --> 01:02.262
So... (Sighs)

01:02.263 --> 01:04.194
Uh, you want to
get some breakfast?

01:04.195 --> 01:06.136
We still have a little time.

01:06.137 --> 01:07.267
I'd like to,

01:07.268 --> 01:09.399
but can you just drop me
off at the school library?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.341
I've got a test today
and I need to study.

01:11.342 --> 01:13.203
You didn't study last night?

01:13.204 --> 01:15.205
It's kinda hard to concentrate
at the house lately.

01:15.206 --> 01:18.248
The walls are, like, paper thin.

01:18.249 --> 01:20.280
Wait. (Chuckles)

01:20.281 --> 01:22.182
What are you saying?

01:22.183 --> 01:25.215
I'm saying, I can hear
the TV downstairs.

01:25.216 --> 01:27.157
What are you saying?

01:27.158 --> 01:29.159
Nothing. Nothin'. Just... mm.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.461
Nothing at all.

01:32.463 --> 01:35.295
(Whispers) Eww.

01:35.296 --> 01:39.169
(Emergency radio chatter)

01:39.170 --> 01:42.173
(Camera shutter clicking)

01:43.404 --> 01:45.435
Good morning, Peter.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.307
Good morning.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.108
What do we got?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.280
The car sailed over
the embankment

01:50.281 --> 01:51.381
just before 5:00 A.M.

01:51.382 --> 01:54.113
The victim's been identified
as Daniel Davidson.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.485
He lives not even
five minutes away.

01:55.486 --> 01:57.147
Who found him?

01:57.148 --> 01:59.249
Two teenagers snuck
out here this morning

01:59.250 --> 02:01.221
to sow their burgeoning oats.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.453
Lot of that going around lately.

02:03.454 --> 02:06.125
Oh, just not
with you, I take it.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.327
(Indistinct conversations)

02:07.328 --> 02:09.128
This fell out of the car

02:09.129 --> 02:11.331
when the medics opened the door.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.303
Another texting
and driving accident?

02:13.304 --> 02:15.165
(Mozart's "eine kleine
nachtmusik" playing)

02:15.166 --> 02:17.267
Oh, god. That's me.

02:17.268 --> 02:18.438
That is your ringtone?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.270
For my mother.

02:20.271 --> 02:23.173
I find the music soothes me
before the inevitable onslaught.

02:23.174 --> 02:24.174
(Music stops)

02:24.175 --> 02:25.215
Damn it. (Liquid splashes)

02:25.216 --> 02:27.146
(Emergency radio chatter)

02:27.147 --> 02:30.180
Is your paresthesia
acting up again?

02:30.181 --> 02:31.381
No. (Exhales)

02:31.382 --> 02:33.383
My mother is.

02:33.384 --> 02:36.186
(Radio chatter continues)

02:36.187 --> 02:37.527
(Man) We've got a
vehicle tech on the way...

02:37.528 --> 02:40.290
(Speaks indistinctly)

02:40.291 --> 02:42.332
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:42.333 --> 02:44.334
Call bud and Sam.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.196
(Morris) He already did.

02:46.197 --> 02:47.537
Ooh. Must be
something pretty juicy

02:47.538 --> 02:51.301
for you to want to call
homicide to a car accident.

02:51.302 --> 02:52.372
Maybe I just missed you.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.473
(Laughs)

02:53.474 --> 02:55.375
Okay.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.377
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

02:57.378 --> 02:59.509
(Exhales)

02:59.510 --> 03:01.511
We've got mud on his shoes

03:01.512 --> 03:04.484
but not on the
gas or brake pedal.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.555
That's weird,

03:05.556 --> 03:07.357
but not stop-the-presses weird.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.259
(Camera shutter clicks) Hmm.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.460
Seat belt's all twisted up.

03:10.461 --> 03:12.262
Seems kinda careless.

03:12.263 --> 03:13.323
Look at his arms and hands.

03:13.324 --> 03:14.524
There's no apparent
compression fractures.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.366
Which he would've gotten
if he'd have braced himself

03:16.367 --> 03:18.328
before the crash. Well,
maybe he was drunk.

03:18.329 --> 03:19.529
Check this out.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.332
Thermal burn from the air bag.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.274
Right in the center
of the forehead.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.205
He didn't turn
away before impact,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.408
which means, he was
probably unconscious.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.440
That's juicy enough for me.

03:30.441 --> 03:32.542
Somebody strapped
this guy into the car

03:32.543 --> 03:35.545
and pushed him over the edge.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.389
This was no accident.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.228
(Indistinct conversations)

03:51.332 --> 03:53.503
What are you up to over there?

03:53.504 --> 03:55.365
Ah, new equipment
coming in today.

03:55.366 --> 03:58.237
Gas chromatograph
mass spectrometer.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.239
I know what it is, but we
ain't getting a new one here.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.511
Yeah, we are. It's
on its way right now.

04:01.512 --> 04:04.314
Oh, no, ma'am. Those babies
cost over 100 grand a pop.

04:04.315 --> 04:06.576
That's my entire equipment
budget for the year.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.378
Mm-hmm, which is
why I spent months

04:08.379 --> 04:10.450
writing Grant proposals
and wining and dining

04:10.451 --> 04:12.382
every major
benefactor in Philly.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.484
No one is touching your budget.

04:14.485 --> 04:15.625
Huh.

04:15.626 --> 04:18.528
I'm glad somebody's in
bed with the right people.

04:18.529 --> 04:19.529
(Laughs)

04:19.530 --> 04:22.362
We all have our talents.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.294
What did she say?

04:24.295 --> 04:26.336
I didn't hear nothin'.

04:26.337 --> 04:27.367
Ethan.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.398
Yeah.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.469
Stop everything.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.301
I have something very
important for you to do.

04:31.302 --> 04:33.503
Really? Sure. What is it?

04:33.504 --> 04:34.604
Fix my cell phone.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.547
It fell into a puddle
at the crime scene.

04:37.548 --> 04:39.349
Uh, yeah.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.580
Thanks.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.452
So... (Sighs)

04:42.453 --> 04:44.283
What is your story?

04:44.284 --> 04:48.287
I did a rapid saliva
test. He wasn't drunk.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.661
Right. Cell phone. That's
what I should be doing.

04:53.564 --> 04:56.496
I see faint ligature marks...
(Camera shutter clicks)

04:56.497 --> 04:58.528
On...

04:58.529 --> 05:00.430
Both wrists... (Clicking)

05:00.431 --> 05:02.432
With a distinct pattern.

05:02.433 --> 05:04.404
No restraints were
found on scene.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.607
And two abrasions on the
posterior upper right arm,

05:07.608 --> 05:09.379
already healing.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.641
Also not from the
accident. (Clicking)

05:11.642 --> 05:12.682
But...

05:12.683 --> 05:15.615
(Clicks)

05:15.616 --> 05:17.517
Huh.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.689
A splinter.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.451
(Click)

05:21.452 --> 05:23.393
And it looks like it's
got white paint on it.

05:23.394 --> 05:24.524
(Blows air) Check
his left nostril.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.498
I think there's
something inside.

05:31.602 --> 05:33.463
Red cloth fibers?

05:33.464 --> 05:35.605
Maybe something was held
over his face to incapacitate him.

05:35.606 --> 05:36.666
Why tie him up?

05:36.667 --> 05:38.408
Good question.

05:38.409 --> 05:39.539
I gotta get a fiber analysis

05:39.540 --> 05:41.511
and a tox screen on
this guy right away.

05:41.512 --> 05:43.413
Ethan.

05:43.414 --> 05:45.415
(Object clatters) Uh, right.

05:45.416 --> 05:49.419
Do you want me to do that
before or after the cell phone?

05:49.420 --> 05:50.481
Before.

05:51.722 --> 05:55.485
Are you sure it was my Daniel?

05:55.486 --> 05:58.528
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Davidson.

05:58.529 --> 06:01.491
You mind telling us the last
time you saw your husband?

06:01.492 --> 06:04.694
When we went to bed
last night, around 11:00.

06:04.695 --> 06:07.366
But he was gone when
I got up this morning.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.738
You weren't surprised
when he wasn't there?

06:08.739 --> 06:10.670
No. He always went to work early

06:10.671 --> 06:12.472
to avoid the traffic.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.474
What'd your husband do?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.676
He was a c.P.A.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.379
Started at his firm the
day after our honeymoon.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.653
Going on 16 years.

06:23.654 --> 06:26.486
(Voice breaks) He was
always such a cautious driver.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.488
Mrs. Davidson,

06:28.489 --> 06:30.490
there's a strong possibility

06:30.491 --> 06:32.592
that someone
staged the accident.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.393
How can that be?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.625
Do you know of anyone

06:35.626 --> 06:37.396
who may have wanted
to hurt your husband?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.628
No.

06:38.629 --> 06:40.500
Everyone loved Daniel.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.503
All he ever did was work
hard to provide for us

06:43.504 --> 06:47.406
so we could have a
house like this and...

06:47.407 --> 06:49.408
"We're... we're all...
We're all living the dream,"

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
he used to always say.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.413
(Crying) I'm sorry.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.447
I can't, uh...

06:57.748 --> 06:59.750
(Mrs. Davidson sniffles)

07:02.553 --> 07:05.556
(Engine whirring)

07:24.545 --> 07:27.548
(Skateboard wheels rattling)

07:36.527 --> 07:38.559
(Peter) Megan, what's wrong?

07:40.531 --> 07:43.793
I used to live on a
cul-De-sac like this.

07:43.794 --> 07:47.838
Nothing is ever what it seems.

07:51.642 --> 07:52.842
(Fabric snaps)

07:52.843 --> 07:55.606
♪♪♪

08:00.811 --> 08:02.712
I'm telling you,

08:02.713 --> 08:04.754
there's something
in the air around here.

08:04.755 --> 08:05.955
I can feel it.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.917
Well, that intuition
and about $7

08:07.918 --> 08:09.789
will get you a cup of coffee.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.621
Where do you get your coffee?

08:11.622 --> 08:12.892
Little bistro down the street.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.923
A bistro?

08:13.924 --> 08:15.625
Oh, come on.

08:15.626 --> 08:16.826
Let's go see if c.S.U.

08:16.827 --> 08:19.699
Has finished processing
the davidsons' car.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.731
And a cause of
death wouldn't hurt.

08:21.732 --> 08:23.833
I'm all over it, detective.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.835
That is, if you can
pry Peter away.

08:25.836 --> 08:27.637
(Car door closes)

08:27.638 --> 08:28.908
(Peter and woman
speaking indistinctly)

08:28.909 --> 08:30.911
(Engine turns over)

08:34.715 --> 08:39.649
(Peter speaking indistinctly)

08:39.650 --> 08:42.021
Thank you.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.855
(Giggles)

08:45.856 --> 08:47.827
What was that? What was what?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.730
(Sexy voice) Oh, your badge...

08:50.731 --> 08:53.863
So big, so powerful.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.004
You should use
that voice more often.

08:55.005 --> 08:56.005
Mm.

08:56.006 --> 08:57.938
(Laughs)

09:04.875 --> 09:06.946
Where are you going?

09:06.947 --> 09:10.050
That splinter in Daniel's arm...

09:12.853 --> 09:15.686
That's blood.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.858
Can I help you?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.861
Uh, Peter dunlop. We're with
the medical examiner's office.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.734
We're investigating the
murder of Daniel Davidson.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.836
Heard it was just a car crash.

09:26.837 --> 09:27.898
Well, you heard wrong.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.070
Now this fence is
on his property line.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.072
Would you care to
explain the blood?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.875
I got into a fight with
Daniel the other day.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.006
A fight about what?

09:37.007 --> 09:38.948
Son of a bitch poisoned my dog.

09:38.949 --> 09:40.049
Do you know that for a fact?

09:40.050 --> 09:41.711
He kept complaining that my dog

09:41.712 --> 09:42.882
was digging up his flower beds.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.984
Then suddenly,
skipper got real sick.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.956
Daniel denied it,

09:46.957 --> 09:48.988
but you do the math.
Where's the dog now?

09:48.989 --> 09:50.820
The vet put him down.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.822
My kids are devastated.

09:52.823 --> 09:54.994
So, yeah, next time I saw him,

09:54.995 --> 09:57.026
we got into it.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.769
But kill him?

09:59.770 --> 10:00.871
No.

10:02.773 --> 10:05.005
Do you mind?

10:11.742 --> 10:15.084
Curtis, have you seen Megan?
She's not answering her cell.

10:15.085 --> 10:16.916
She's out with
Peter, bud, and Sam.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.948
Would you just please let
her know... (Elevator bell dings)

10:18.949 --> 10:20.951
I need to speak
with her immediately?

10:25.856 --> 10:26.856
(Sighs)

10:26.857 --> 10:28.028
(Elevator bell dings)

10:29.860 --> 10:33.102
Hey. Kate was just looking
for you, head all full of steam.

10:33.103 --> 10:35.064
Ugh. Tell her I'm
on a murder case.

10:35.065 --> 10:37.767
Unh-unh. I watch telenovelas.

10:37.768 --> 10:39.939
You two ain't sticking
me in the middle.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.972
This story has a tragic
end with no survivors.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.814
(Indistinct conversations)

10:44.815 --> 10:46.946
(Morris) So c.S.U. Found
some fingertip impressions

10:46.947 --> 10:49.849
on the rear bumper
of the car, caked in dirt.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.950
Right where you
push a car off the road.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.852
Any Ridge detail?

10:52.853 --> 10:55.124
No, just a crosshatch pattern.
The killer probably wore gloves.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.126
But they also
found this fancy key

10:57.127 --> 10:59.058
lodged in the driver's seat.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.792
I'll do you one better.
Remember Daniel's cell phone?

11:02.793 --> 11:03.893
Yeah.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.835
There was an unsent text
message on the screen.

11:05.836 --> 11:08.037
Before he died, he typed out,

11:08.038 --> 11:09.999
"I have to say something."

11:10.000 --> 11:12.001
Who was he gonna send it to?

11:12.002 --> 11:14.944
Just comes up a
first name... "Vicki."

11:14.945 --> 11:16.005
And you traced the number?

11:16.006 --> 11:18.007
She's one of his neighbors.

11:18.008 --> 11:19.849
(Indistinct conversations)

11:19.850 --> 11:20.910
(School bell rings)

11:20.911 --> 11:23.083
(Indistinct conversations)

11:35.966 --> 11:37.026
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

11:37.027 --> 11:38.968
Kate?

11:38.969 --> 11:40.830
Lacey, what happened?
Are you okay?

11:40.831 --> 11:43.102
I-I got sick in class.
What are you doing here?

11:43.103 --> 11:46.936
Uh, your dad is in
court, and your mom is...

11:46.937 --> 11:49.980
I just want to go home.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.919
(Sighs)

11:59.920 --> 12:01.951
Oh, where have
you been, Casanova?

12:01.952 --> 12:03.192
You know, that woman
may have had information

12:03.193 --> 12:04.924
that was pertinent to the case.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.055
Stuck in her cleavage?

12:06.056 --> 12:07.126
(Laughs)

12:07.127 --> 12:08.958
You were flirting.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.159
I was just doing my job, Megan.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.001
Mm.

12:12.002 --> 12:14.003
You're the one who seems
to be fixated on sex lately.

12:14.004 --> 12:17.236
Maybe it's because my boss

12:17.237 --> 12:21.040
is having sleepovers
with my ex-husband

12:21.041 --> 12:23.072
in a house with
paper-thin walls.

12:23.073 --> 12:25.945
Okay, let's change
the subject, shall we?

12:25.946 --> 12:28.017
What was Daniel
Davidson's cause of death?

12:28.018 --> 12:31.981
Aortic transection due
to the impact of the crash.

12:31.982 --> 12:34.223
But I did find something
I didn't expect.

12:34.224 --> 12:35.885
What?

12:35.886 --> 12:37.256
The color of the brain is off,

12:37.257 --> 12:40.890
and the cortical surfaces are
mildly depressed bilaterally.

12:40.891 --> 12:43.032
He had a leukoencephalopathy.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.994
How'd he get that? Not sure.

12:44.995 --> 12:47.166
The insulation of the
nerves inside his brain

12:47.167 --> 12:49.238
was being destroyed.

12:49.239 --> 12:52.241
Given the demyelination,
it could be m.S.

12:52.242 --> 12:55.044
Or he could have a
polyomavirus infection,

12:55.045 --> 12:57.206
specifically a j.C. Virus.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.178
Doesn't that virus
only infect people

12:59.179 --> 13:01.951
with a weakened immune system?

13:01.952 --> 13:05.054
But Daniel has never
had an organ transplant.

13:05.055 --> 13:08.087
And he had no history
of hodgkin's or leukemia.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.989
There is one other possibility.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.020
(Splashes)

13:11.021 --> 13:14.194
He could be h.I.V. Positive.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.070
Vicki hemington?

13:21.071 --> 13:22.071
Yes.

13:22.072 --> 13:23.072
Bud Morris.

13:23.073 --> 13:24.203
Philly homicide.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.936
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

13:26.937 --> 13:28.307
about Daniel Davidson
if you don't mind.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.309
(Exhales) It's so
horrible, what happened.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.082
Daniel was such a great guy.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.085
Well, we think his accident
was a result of foul play.

13:36.086 --> 13:37.216
Really?

13:37.217 --> 13:40.089
Would you mind if we took
a look around, uh, inside?

13:40.090 --> 13:42.952
Oh, uh... no. Not at all.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.153
Yeah. Follow me.

13:44.154 --> 13:46.026
(Whispers) Sam.

13:55.205 --> 13:58.037
So tell me, Mrs. Hemington,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.169
did you know Daniel very well?

14:00.170 --> 14:03.042
As well as you can
know a neighbor, I guess.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.274
I know this is a
sensitive matter,

14:05.275 --> 14:07.146
but I have to ask.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.078
Were you two having an affair?

14:09.079 --> 14:10.279
(Man) A what?

14:10.280 --> 14:12.151
Bill, what are you doing home?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.023
Vicki, what the hell?

14:14.024 --> 14:16.025
I didn't know you were
coming home for lunch.

14:16.026 --> 14:18.027
Yeah, I guess not.
What's going on?

14:18.028 --> 14:19.228
Who are you?

14:19.229 --> 14:21.130
They're from the police
department, honey.

14:21.131 --> 14:22.992
It's about Daniel. They say
he may have been murdered.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.334
Detective Samantha baker.
You must be bill hemington.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.266
There's a cop in our house?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.998
We were invited in.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.199
Now you're invited out.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.272
I'm an attorney.
I know our rights.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.104
Oh, bill, her
partner's here, too.

14:35.105 --> 14:37.076
Where?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.278
(Objects clatter)

14:39.279 --> 14:41.350
(Sighs)

14:41.351 --> 14:44.253
Sam, can you come
in here, please?

14:44.254 --> 14:47.117
Excuse me.

14:53.063 --> 14:56.295
Guess we know
who tied him up now.

14:56.296 --> 15:00.299
I just love it when suspects
provide their own handcuffs,

15:00.300 --> 15:02.232
don't you?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.579
Your husband's
in the other room,

15:10.580 --> 15:12.511
Mrs. Hemington, so...
be honest with me.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.444
You were having an
affair with Daniel Davidson.

15:15.445 --> 15:17.987
Like I told your partner... No.

15:17.988 --> 15:20.649
So the key to your s-and-m
treasure trove just, uh...

15:20.650 --> 15:22.952
Happened to fall into his car?

15:22.953 --> 15:24.923
No, he must have
taken it by mistake.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.695
And did he also accidentally

15:26.696 --> 15:28.697
tie himself up?

15:28.698 --> 15:31.460
Oh, no, I did that.

15:31.461 --> 15:32.931
We did have sex,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.033
many...

15:34.034 --> 15:36.635
(Laughs) Many, many times.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.538
Yeah, but I wouldn't
call it an affair.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.611
Yes, I knew my wife
was sleeping with Daniel.

15:42.612 --> 15:43.973
You did?

15:43.974 --> 15:46.015
I'm the one who set them up.

15:46.016 --> 15:49.678
I'm a very sexual
person, detective.

15:49.679 --> 15:51.550
And bill, god love him,

15:51.551 --> 15:53.722
he tried so hard
to keep me happy.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.024
(Clicks tongue)

15:55.025 --> 15:57.656
But I was just getting a
little bored, you know?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.058
So bill just did what

15:59.059 --> 16:00.959
any good husband would.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.032
I threw a block
party to, you know,

16:03.033 --> 16:04.994
put out some feelers.

16:04.995 --> 16:06.996
I was a little nervous at first.

16:06.997 --> 16:09.638
The neighborhood
could cast us out.

16:09.639 --> 16:12.001
Almost everyone wanted in.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.702
Y-Your block is
full of swingers?

16:13.703 --> 16:14.703
Play couples.

16:14.704 --> 16:16.975
Oh. Play couples.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.508
Yeah. And can I
tell you something?

16:19.509 --> 16:23.983
It has made my marriage
stronger than ever.

16:25.585 --> 16:30.020
When's the last time you
had total mind-blowing sex?

16:32.722 --> 16:35.694
1994.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.567
Monogamy is dead, detective.

16:38.568 --> 16:40.729
So...

16:40.730 --> 16:42.771
Is my murder victim.

16:42.772 --> 16:45.104
Well, I didn't kill him.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.606
Daniel was perfectly fine when
he left my house this morning.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.638
And what time was that?

16:49.639 --> 16:51.580
4:45 A.M.

16:51.581 --> 16:54.613
Bill knocked off early, and
I was feeling a little restless

16:54.614 --> 16:56.615
so I called up Daniel,
and he came over.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.016
And what did you do?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.049
A lot less than
I would've liked.

17:00.050 --> 17:03.092
I tied him up. You know,
tried to play some games.

17:03.093 --> 17:05.094
But I don't know. He just
wasn't into it for some reason.

17:05.095 --> 17:07.626
(Clicks tongue) So we
just ended up talking.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.727
(Inhales)

17:08.728 --> 17:11.600
Just before he died, he
was going to send you a text.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.802
"I have to say something."

17:13.803 --> 17:15.764
What was that about?

17:15.765 --> 17:18.107
I don't know.

17:18.108 --> 17:21.570
Maybe he wanted to
say something to his wife.

17:21.571 --> 17:25.074
I mean, he said that he
wasn't into the lifestyle anymore,

17:25.075 --> 17:27.116
that it had... Consequences.

17:27.117 --> 17:29.649
Consequences? What k...

17:31.821 --> 17:34.783
What kind of consequences
are you talking...

17:34.784 --> 17:36.786
(knocking on window)

17:40.160 --> 17:41.691
Excuse me.

17:48.598 --> 17:50.599
Did I call it or what?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.070
A wife-swapping cul-De-sac.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.672
You were right.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.803
Now was that intuition,

17:54.804 --> 17:56.805
or do you have something
you'd like to share with me

17:56.806 --> 17:58.707
about you and
your ex? (Laughing)

17:58.708 --> 18:00.109
I'm just saying...

18:00.110 --> 18:03.182
This has piqued more than
just your professional curiosity.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.783
Yeah.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.785
If it weren't for
the consequences.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.188
(Bill) Yeah, a few times
over the past six months or so.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.190
(Sam) And Daniel
was okay with this?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.191
Of course.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.622
So?

18:13.623 --> 18:15.624
So I imagine an
arrangement like that

18:15.625 --> 18:17.626
would breed a lot of jealousy.

18:17.627 --> 18:19.168
No, we had very specific rules.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.099
Sex with no secrets.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.173
Everyone plays fair,
nobody gets hurt.

18:24.174 --> 18:26.175
Did the rules always
work? Not always.

18:26.176 --> 18:28.777
Kevin kaiser's wife
left him, took the kids.

18:28.778 --> 18:31.180
She, uh, couldn't handle it.

18:31.181 --> 18:33.782
Mr. Hemington, I'm with
the medical examiner's office.

18:33.783 --> 18:35.784
It seems that Daniel
Davidson's immune system

18:35.785 --> 18:37.146
was compromised.

18:37.147 --> 18:39.148
I don't have confirmation yet,

18:39.149 --> 18:41.791
but it's possible that he
was infected with h.I.V.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.224
No. Uh...

18:45.225 --> 18:48.227
No, i-i-i... I can't
believe that.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.129
That was another
one of our rules.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.132
Everyone gets tested,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.234
frequently.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.166
So... you didn't
happen to discover

18:57.167 --> 18:58.767
Daniel was infected

18:58.768 --> 19:01.810
and kill him for
exposing your wife?

19:01.811 --> 19:03.872
No.

19:03.873 --> 19:07.676
Daniel was clean.

19:07.677 --> 19:08.878
I swear to god.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.152
(Indistinct conversations)

19:14.153 --> 19:16.154
You still fretting about
that dang phone?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.756
You know, I used
everything in this lab

19:17.757 --> 19:18.887
to try and dry it out.

19:18.888 --> 19:20.689
You know, I even
stuck it in the centrifuge.

19:20.690 --> 19:21.830
You did what now?

19:21.831 --> 19:24.233
I give up. I'm a
doctor not an engineer.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.696
(Sighs) What, are you
selling stuff on eBay?

19:27.697 --> 19:29.167
Hmm. You real funny.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.700
Homicide confiscated this

19:31.701 --> 19:33.772
from a suspect in
the Davidson case.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.906
Ha ha. How you like me now,
Darth Vader? Who's your daddy?

19:37.907 --> 19:40.178
I don't think we saw the
same "star wars," man.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.711
Here we go.

19:42.712 --> 19:44.913
Restraints.

19:44.914 --> 19:47.787
Let me see.

19:48.818 --> 19:52.821
Same width, same
circular pattern.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.923
Looks like a match to me.

19:54.924 --> 19:56.265
Congratulations.

19:56.266 --> 19:57.926
You just proved that he
liked to be tied up during sex.

19:57.927 --> 20:00.198
Ethan, I will pop you, boy.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.771
Did you find a
red cloth in there?

20:02.772 --> 20:03.832
Why?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.304
'Cause we found
fibers in his nose

20:05.305 --> 20:07.205
from whatever was
used to knock him out.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.907
No, nothing but leather...

20:08.908 --> 20:10.739
(Clattering)

20:10.740 --> 20:11.880
Chains...

20:11.881 --> 20:14.212
Ew. And some kind of gel.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.914
That's not gel. (Groans)

20:15.915 --> 20:18.747
Oh, no. Dr. Hunt. I gotta
tell her about her phone.

20:18.748 --> 20:20.749
Her phone? Come
on. Where's her phone?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.951
Oh, no. No, no, no, no,
no. Where's her phone?

20:22.952 --> 20:24.753
Oh, this can't be happening.

20:24.754 --> 20:25.824
Ethan.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.756
What?

20:27.757 --> 20:29.828
What are you doing?!

20:29.829 --> 20:30.999
You put it in rice?
Are you crazy?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.301
You owe me. What
is wrong with you?

20:32.302 --> 20:33.302
I owe you? What...

20:33.303 --> 20:35.334
My phone.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.836
You fixed it.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.837
Genius. Thank you.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.909
Ain't no thang. (Chimes)

20:40.910 --> 20:42.271
Oh, god. What?

20:42.272 --> 20:43.913
Lacey.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.818
(Imitates Yoda)
Saved my butt, you did.

20:49.819 --> 20:50.919
Mm.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.783
Shut up, Ethan.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.828
What happened?
Is Lacey all right?

20:59.829 --> 21:01.860
She's fine. She's fine.
She threw up at school

21:01.861 --> 21:03.292
and just needed
someone to pick her up.

21:03.293 --> 21:05.294
I was stuck in my
depo. I-I-I called you.

21:05.295 --> 21:06.835
I called your
office, your cell...

21:06.836 --> 21:08.036
I didn't get any messages.
My cell was broken.

21:08.037 --> 21:09.798
Otherwise, I
would've been there.

21:09.799 --> 21:11.039
I know, I know, but you weren't.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.372
So I called the next
person I could think of.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.043
Right.

21:15.044 --> 21:16.845
Your girlfriend.

21:16.846 --> 21:17.876
I tried to reach you, Megan.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.378
You didn't try hard
enough. Megan.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.049
(Clears throat) She's sleeping.

21:21.050 --> 21:22.381
She's in her room. Don't worry.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.953
Don'ttell me not to worry.

21:24.954 --> 21:27.356
Megan... stop.

21:27.357 --> 21:28.987
Come on. She's fine. All right?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.320
I'll let her know you
came by, all right?

21:31.321 --> 21:33.962
Just let her rest.

21:33.963 --> 21:36.896
Come on.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.975
Thank you.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.381
(Lowered voice) I'm sorry.

21:52.382 --> 21:54.043
(Sighs)

21:57.887 --> 21:59.388
(Elevator bell dings)

21:59.389 --> 22:01.390
(Sighs)

22:01.391 --> 22:02.991
Good morning.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.353
Hey, I got the, uh,
blood work back

22:04.354 --> 22:05.424
on Daniel Davidson.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.955
And guess what.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.957
He didn't have h.I.V.
Or any other disease

22:08.958 --> 22:10.959
that would've caused
the immunosuppression.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.030
Really?

22:12.031 --> 22:13.101
Yep.

22:13.102 --> 22:15.033
Then what gave him
the leukoencephalopathy?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.435
Beats me, but I did find out

22:16.436 --> 22:18.106
what the cloth fibers
were doused with.

22:18.107 --> 22:19.368
Brake cleaner.

22:19.369 --> 22:20.969
Why would anybody
use brake cleaner

22:20.970 --> 22:22.371
to knock somebody out?

22:22.372 --> 22:23.972
Weapon of opportunity maybe?

22:23.973 --> 22:26.074
(Sighs)

22:26.075 --> 22:28.417
Daniel's neighbor
across the street...

22:28.418 --> 22:31.450
He was working
on his motorcycle.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.923
Call Peter. Tell him
to meet me there.

22:34.924 --> 22:38.026
I wanna understand this
whole swapping thing.

22:38.027 --> 22:40.358
I mean, what's the math?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.960
How many people?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.362
Is it two, three, ten?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.034
Megan, this is Kevin kaiser,

22:46.035 --> 22:48.437
the guy whose wife left him
over the whole swapping thing.

22:48.438 --> 22:50.038
That might be a
little bit insensitive,

22:50.039 --> 22:51.369
don't you think?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.141
You're so square. (Laughs)

22:53.142 --> 22:55.474
(Peter) Mr. Kaiser, we're, uh,

22:55.475 --> 22:57.075
investigating the murder
of Daniel Davidson.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.077
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

22:59.078 --> 23:01.010
Sure. What do you want to know?

23:02.452 --> 23:04.152
Uh, uh, we understand

23:04.153 --> 23:08.086
that relationships on
the cul-De-sac were...

23:08.087 --> 23:09.387
Complex.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.089
That's personal.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.991
What does that have
to do with Daniel?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.092
Well, a lot, actually,

23:14.093 --> 23:15.464
if you were sleeping
with each other's wives.

23:15.465 --> 23:17.165
We heard from one
of your neighbors

23:17.166 --> 23:19.068
that it might have
broken up your marriage.

23:21.030 --> 23:22.170
I, uh...

23:22.171 --> 23:25.103
I realized I was having
feelings for Andrea.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.006
Unfortunately, my
wife realized first.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.478
That sounds like motive to me.

23:29.479 --> 23:31.480
Your wife leaves
you, and the only thing

23:31.481 --> 23:33.411
standing between you
and Andrea is her husband?

23:33.412 --> 23:36.485
No. That's not it at all. You mind if
I have a look around your garage?

23:36.486 --> 23:38.117
It's fine. Okay.

23:44.494 --> 23:45.954
So...

23:45.955 --> 23:48.096
Um...

23:48.097 --> 23:50.158
Yeah?

23:50.159 --> 23:52.000
Never mind.

23:52.001 --> 23:54.002
(Elevator bell dings)

23:54.003 --> 23:56.034
I'm just saying,
it's been too long

23:56.035 --> 23:58.967
since I've had total
mind-blowing sex.

23:58.968 --> 24:02.210
Not right now, thanks. I
got a caffeine headache.

24:02.211 --> 24:04.442
No red shop towels or
brake cleaner laying around.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.044
Then again, I don't imagine

24:06.045 --> 24:07.476
he'd keep them after a murder.

24:07.477 --> 24:10.549
Why just limit it to him?
It takes two to tango.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.181
Or three or... ten?

24:13.182 --> 24:14.553
(Morris) Seriously,

24:14.554 --> 24:16.154
Jeannie and I need to reconnect.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.026
I'm thinking date night.

24:18.027 --> 24:19.127
(Cell phone rings)

24:19.128 --> 24:20.529
I better warn that poor woman.

24:20.530 --> 24:22.460
(Ring)

24:22.461 --> 24:24.133
Baker.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.536
Go ahead, Megan.
You're on speaker.

24:27.537 --> 24:29.467
So are you.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.040
Remember that guy that
bill hemington told us about,

24:32.041 --> 24:33.502
uh, Kevin kaiser,

24:33.503 --> 24:36.575
the one whose marriage
broke up because of thelifestyle?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.076
Yeah.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.207
(Peter) It was Andrea
Davidson who caused it.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.579
Uh, Kevin had feelings for her.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.551
What if the feelings
were reciprocated?

24:42.552 --> 24:44.082
What if they were
in it together?

24:44.083 --> 24:47.055
Bump off Daniel, pocket the
life insurance money and...

24:47.056 --> 24:49.017
That would explain the cash.

24:49.018 --> 24:50.158
Wait a minute. What cash?

24:50.159 --> 24:52.160
(Sam) We ran the
financials on the davidsons.

24:52.161 --> 24:54.092
Andrea took out a cash
advance on her credit card

24:54.093 --> 24:55.223
two days ago.

24:55.224 --> 24:56.565
$15,000.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.226
Vicki hemington said that Daniel

24:58.227 --> 25:00.068
left her house at 4:45.

25:00.069 --> 25:03.271
And he went over the
embankment 15 minutes later.

25:03.272 --> 25:05.604
In that time, someone had
to grab him, incapacitate him,

25:05.605 --> 25:08.537
drive him out to that park,
and push the car over.

25:08.538 --> 25:10.078
Tight window.

25:10.079 --> 25:11.580
So either Vicki's
lying about the timeline

25:11.581 --> 25:13.111
or...

25:13.112 --> 25:15.183
Or the killer was already
outside Daniel's house,

25:15.184 --> 25:16.514
laying in wait.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.547
After being paid $15,000.

25:18.548 --> 25:21.551
Our grieving widow
hired a hit man.

25:26.996 --> 25:28.997
(Morris) So what did you
spend the $15,000 on?

25:28.998 --> 25:30.929
You think I hired someone
to kill my husband?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.131
We know couples were
exchanging partners

25:33.132 --> 25:34.262
in your neighborhood,
Mrs. Davidson.

25:34.263 --> 25:36.134
And that your relationship
with Kevin kaiser

25:36.135 --> 25:38.106
ended his marriage.

25:38.107 --> 25:39.938
Well, I never wanted that.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.009
(Megan) No?

25:41.010 --> 25:43.071
He told us that he
had feelings for you.

25:43.072 --> 25:44.272
You didn't feel the same way?

25:44.273 --> 25:47.275
No. Never.

25:47.276 --> 25:50.218
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

25:50.219 --> 25:53.181
Daniel and I, we had
our rough patches.

25:53.182 --> 25:56.254
But being with Kevin only
made me love my husband more.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.086
Vicki hemington told us that

25:58.087 --> 26:00.288
your husband said he wasn't
even enjoying the lifestyle,

26:00.289 --> 26:03.291
that it had consequences.

26:03.292 --> 26:05.034
He said that?

26:06.135 --> 26:08.136
Well, he was right.

26:08.137 --> 26:10.999
It was all just a distraction.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.972
And that's why I
took out the money.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.105
I-It was an investment
in our future.

26:17.106 --> 26:19.107
How so?

26:19.108 --> 26:22.310
I was gonna buy into
a time-share condo

26:22.311 --> 26:25.353
in narantha island,
near Bermuda.

26:25.354 --> 26:28.086
You thought a time-share
would save your marriage?

26:28.087 --> 26:32.060
Daniel always wanted
to go somewhere tropical,

26:32.061 --> 26:34.222
and the island seemed perfect.

26:34.223 --> 26:36.024
It was a place
we could have fun,

26:36.025 --> 26:37.225
learn how to be a couple again.

26:37.226 --> 26:41.029
Like everything
else, it backfired, too.

26:41.030 --> 26:42.100
How?

26:42.101 --> 26:44.072
(Sighs) He found
out about the money

26:44.073 --> 26:46.034
and he got really angry.

26:46.035 --> 26:48.036
I told him I'd try
and get it back.

26:48.037 --> 26:49.237
Who'd you give the money to?

26:49.238 --> 26:52.110
(Sighs) Vicki.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.243
She talked to all the
women on the block about it,

26:55.244 --> 26:57.385
told us to invite
our female friends.

26:57.386 --> 27:02.120
She's giving a presentation
at her house later today.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.392
That text message... "I
have to say something."

27:04.393 --> 27:06.394
Do you think Daniel found out

27:06.395 --> 27:08.396
Vicki was trying
to hide something?

27:08.397 --> 27:10.398
I would love to see that
presentation, but no way

27:10.399 --> 27:13.061
we're getting back in that
house, not after yesterday.

27:13.062 --> 27:15.033
Excuse me. She'd never allow it.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.064
Excuse me.

27:16.065 --> 27:18.136
Vicki's never met me.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.338
(Calypso music playing)

27:20.339 --> 27:23.271
Ooh, Andrea.

27:23.272 --> 27:26.174
You poor dear.

27:26.175 --> 27:29.047
So brave to still
make it out today.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.179
Just know...

27:31.180 --> 27:33.121
We are all grieving.

27:33.122 --> 27:34.322
Thank you. Yeah.

27:34.323 --> 27:36.124
You said to bring
friends, right?

27:36.125 --> 27:37.185
Mm-hmm.

27:37.186 --> 27:38.256
This is Megan.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.328
Ooh. So nice to
have you. Thank you.

27:40.329 --> 27:43.131
Ladies, please...
Make yourself at home.

27:43.132 --> 27:44.362
(Music continues)

27:44.363 --> 27:46.164
Thank you.

27:46.165 --> 27:49.167
(Music continues)

27:49.168 --> 27:50.438
(Bell tinkling) Ah, yes.

27:50.439 --> 27:53.141
Thank you. (Andrea,
singsongy) Ladies.

27:53.142 --> 27:56.404
(Chuckles) It is so great
to have you all here today.

27:56.405 --> 27:59.077
(Tinkles)

27:59.078 --> 28:02.410
As a sisterhood, we all
have something in common.

28:02.411 --> 28:07.255
We know an amazing
opportunity when it presents itself

28:07.256 --> 28:11.219
and also possess
the strength to seize it.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.220
(Sets glass down)

28:12.221 --> 28:13.291
Narantha island...

28:13.292 --> 28:15.393
This newly discovered gem

28:15.394 --> 28:19.127
has been untouched
by time or tourism.

28:19.128 --> 28:21.099
And for a small down payment,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.471
you can begin to own a piece

28:23.472 --> 28:26.474
of an all-inclusive community.

28:26.475 --> 28:29.107
I know I don't need
to give you a hard sell

28:29.108 --> 28:31.109
because the proof
is in the pudding.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.380
(Giggles)

28:32.381 --> 28:36.314
I'm giving each of you a
chance to invest in yourselves,

28:36.315 --> 28:38.346
in your own future,

28:38.347 --> 28:42.250
to stop being dependent
on your parents,

28:42.251 --> 28:44.322
your husbands,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.325
anyone. (Silverware
clanks against glass)

28:48.127 --> 28:49.497
Excuse me. Hi.

28:49.498 --> 28:51.229
Hello.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.400
Sorry.

28:52.401 --> 28:57.135
I am all for financial
independence

28:57.136 --> 28:58.336
but I think,

28:58.337 --> 29:01.269
first the sisterhood

29:01.270 --> 29:03.271
should first know
the ingredients

29:03.272 --> 29:05.413
in therealpudding.

29:05.414 --> 29:08.246
I had my friends at
the police department

29:08.247 --> 29:10.278
do a little research.

29:10.279 --> 29:13.281
And it turns out
that narantha island

29:13.282 --> 29:16.524
is not so much an island per se

29:16.525 --> 29:19.487
but a landfill
covered with topsoil.

29:19.488 --> 29:22.290
And as for being near Bermuda,

29:22.291 --> 29:24.332
it's actually...

29:24.333 --> 29:27.295
In the Bermuda triangle.

29:27.296 --> 29:30.198
I'm not saying that you'll
disappear if you go there,

29:30.199 --> 29:32.370
but your money certainly will.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.302
Guaranteed.

29:34.303 --> 29:36.444
I imagine you already
knew all that, didn't you?

29:36.445 --> 29:38.476
(Laughs) Are youkidding?

29:38.477 --> 29:40.308
Of course not.

29:40.309 --> 29:42.510
Oh. And what about
Daniel Davidson?

29:42.511 --> 29:44.452
He catch on to your scheme?

29:44.453 --> 29:46.354
That's enough. Get out.

29:46.355 --> 29:47.555
I'm gonna find out the truth.

29:47.556 --> 29:49.457
But until then,

29:49.458 --> 29:53.322
you're going to pay back
every cent you were given.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.464
(Sighs)

29:56.465 --> 29:59.227
(Indistinct conversations)

29:59.228 --> 30:00.398
I'm not sure when
I'll be off work.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.201
(Woman) No problem.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.373
You know, we should
go and grab a drink or...

30:05.374 --> 30:06.574
(Woman) Yeah.
Coffee or... i don't know.

30:06.575 --> 30:08.306
Yeah, let's do it. Peter.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.377
Anything. Huh?

30:09.378 --> 30:11.239
Uh...

30:11.240 --> 30:12.310
You better call me.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.213
I will. (Door closes)

30:16.285 --> 30:17.345
(Woman laughs)

30:17.346 --> 30:19.347
(Women speaking indistinctly)

30:19.348 --> 30:21.549
Wow. You certainly
know how to clear a room.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.491
Ugh. You wouldn't
believe it in there.

30:23.492 --> 30:25.293
What did Vicki say?

30:25.294 --> 30:27.295
It's not just her. It's
all of them. It's bizarre.

30:27.296 --> 30:29.297
I mean, i... Daniel's
just been murdered,

30:29.298 --> 30:31.329
and... and they act
like nothing's going on.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.361
This is really
affecting you, huh?

30:33.362 --> 30:35.233
What? I'm not crying.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.265
Yes, you are. (Chuckles)

30:37.266 --> 30:41.309
(Women continue
speaking indistinctly)

30:41.310 --> 30:43.371
Where's your kit?
You have your kit?

30:43.372 --> 30:45.373
(Sighs)

30:45.374 --> 30:47.615
What are you doing?

30:47.616 --> 30:50.448
Those vials are for
evidence, you know?

30:50.449 --> 30:52.420
Exactly.

30:52.421 --> 30:53.551
What, you honestly think

30:53.552 --> 30:56.324
the answer to solving
this case is in your tears?

30:56.325 --> 30:58.327
Actually, I do.

31:07.196 --> 31:08.396
I have to say, this
goes above and beyond

31:08.397 --> 31:10.198
even for you, doctor. (Sighs)

31:10.199 --> 31:12.300
Actually using taxpayer dollars

31:12.301 --> 31:13.441
to test your own tears

31:13.442 --> 31:15.303
just to disprove the
fact that you cried.

31:15.304 --> 31:16.504
I was not crying, detective.

31:16.505 --> 31:18.306
Believe me, you will
know when I'm crying.

31:18.307 --> 31:19.377
Uh-huh. Sure you weren't.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.349
Everyone of those
women at the presentation

31:21.350 --> 31:23.381
got all teary-eyed for
no reason whatsoever,

31:23.382 --> 31:24.452
and then I did.

31:24.453 --> 31:25.513
That's called being a woman.

31:25.514 --> 31:27.455
Scientists proved that
thousands of years ago.

31:27.456 --> 31:29.517
Oh! (Ethan) Hey.

31:29.518 --> 31:32.290
Here's the tox report
you ordered on your...

31:32.291 --> 31:35.463
Uh, lacrimal fluids.

31:35.464 --> 31:37.265
This can't be
right. It's negative.

31:37.266 --> 31:40.198
Can we go back to
solving a murder now?

31:40.199 --> 31:42.200
Ethan, could you please
get me a ph test strip

31:42.201 --> 31:43.431
and the collection vial?

31:43.432 --> 31:46.204
Right away.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.307
(Clears throat)

31:49.578 --> 31:51.410
This... this horse
is dead, you know?

32:03.322 --> 32:04.592
(Laughs) I knew it.

32:04.593 --> 32:06.354
That thing test insanity?

32:06.355 --> 32:09.397
It tests acidity.

32:09.398 --> 32:11.399
The normal ph of
human tears is around 7.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.530
Mine is at a 4,

32:12.531 --> 32:15.303
which means that everyone
at the hemington house

32:15.304 --> 32:18.536
was exposed to a
volatile acidic compound

32:18.537 --> 32:21.469
which affected all of
our mucus membranes.

32:21.470 --> 32:27.375
I need to see the slides
of Daniel Davidson's brain.

32:27.376 --> 32:31.449
It turns out, there actually
is something in the air.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.551
Ah. So...

32:33.552 --> 32:35.553
Daniel did have
spongiform regions

32:35.554 --> 32:37.425
in his subcortical white matter,

32:37.426 --> 32:39.427
which means he was suffering
from a leukoencephalopathy

32:39.428 --> 32:40.628
like I thought,

32:40.629 --> 32:42.430
but this was toxin-induced.

32:42.431 --> 32:43.591
Toxin-induced?

32:43.592 --> 32:46.294
Like from the brake cleaner
he was incapacitated with?

32:46.295 --> 32:47.465
No, that was an acute exposure.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.596
This would be chronic.

32:48.597 --> 32:51.469
Absorbed over a
period of months maybe.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.471
So what was he exposed to?

32:53.472 --> 32:55.473
(Sighs) We'll have to check
his liver and blood to find out,

32:55.474 --> 32:57.475
and that is not a
normal tox report.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.477
Farming it out is
gonna take days.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.380
No, it won't. Why don't we
just use our new mass spec?

33:02.381 --> 33:05.313
You're funny. Oh, my god. Do I
know something that you don't know?

33:05.314 --> 33:06.514
(Laughs) We don't
have a new mass spec.

33:06.515 --> 33:08.356
Yes, we do have a new mass spec.

33:08.357 --> 33:10.358
It was delivered
yesterday. It was set up.

33:10.359 --> 33:13.392
It's ready to go. Dr. Kate
Murphy to the rescue.

33:15.664 --> 33:18.367
Huh.

33:20.369 --> 33:22.370
Hi, lace. It's me again.

33:22.371 --> 33:23.571
I hope you're feeling better.

33:23.572 --> 33:25.373
And I hope you know

33:25.374 --> 33:28.476
that I wasn't avoiding
your calls yesterday.

33:28.477 --> 33:31.639
I'm gonna come
by after work, okay?

33:31.640 --> 33:34.482
Love you.

33:34.483 --> 33:36.384
(Knock on door)

33:36.385 --> 33:37.616
This a bad time?

33:48.697 --> 33:51.459
When Lacey was 7,

33:51.460 --> 33:53.661
she got these
skates that she loved.

33:53.662 --> 33:55.603
She used to...

33:55.604 --> 33:57.605
Go up and down
the street for hours.

33:57.606 --> 33:59.607
I'd watch her.

33:59.608 --> 34:01.569
And one day she, um...

34:01.570 --> 34:05.473
She hit a rock, she tripped,
and she skinned her knees.

34:05.474 --> 34:07.645
I carried her into the
house, fixed her up,

34:07.646 --> 34:11.550
and just held her
until she calmed down.

34:13.352 --> 34:16.524
And she looked up at me...

34:16.525 --> 34:18.557
Smiled...

34:20.589 --> 34:24.562
And I felt something that
I had never felt before.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.695
I was her hero.

34:29.538 --> 34:32.571
I've done nothing but
disappoint her ever since.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.406
Yesterday, you were her hero.

34:38.407 --> 34:41.609
Megan, Todd asked for my
help and I gave it. That's all.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.412
And I tried to get ahold
of you numerous times.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.384
My phone was broken.
You... you could've tried Peter.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.416
You know, I have
a job to do, too.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.418
And if you think for a minute
that I want to get in the middle

34:50.419 --> 34:52.520
of whatever family drama
you've got on tap for the day...

34:52.521 --> 34:54.462
Come on. That is not fair.

34:54.463 --> 34:56.464
No, what's not fair is you
playing me off as a bad guy

34:56.465 --> 34:57.695
for helping your daughter

34:57.696 --> 35:00.698
just because you're desperate
to buy back a moment with her.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.500
All right? It's not
my responsibility.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.702
Okay? It's yours.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.536
I'm telling you, telenovelas,
ain't no survivors.

35:08.537 --> 35:10.438
What is it, Curtis?

35:10.439 --> 35:12.680
Got the report you needed
from the new mass spec...

35:12.681 --> 35:16.414
Daniel Davidson's
liver and blood.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.416
There's definitely a toxin
running through his system.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.418
There's a spike in the
area of the volatiles,

35:20.419 --> 35:23.421
characteristic of...

35:23.422 --> 35:24.522
Toluene.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.693
That's a hydrocarbon.

35:25.694 --> 35:27.425
Nasty stuff.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.658
Found in gasoline, acrylics,
and paint thinners among others.

35:30.659 --> 35:32.700
So Daniel was suffering
from toluene toxicity.

35:32.701 --> 35:35.503
That is what caused
the leukoencephalopathy.

35:35.504 --> 35:38.807
That whole neighborhood
is being exposed to poison.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.512
And it could be
killing all of them.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.618
(Sirens wailing)

35:50.619 --> 35:52.680
(Tires squealing)

35:52.681 --> 35:53.881
(Wailing continues)

35:53.882 --> 35:55.683
(Police radio chatter)

35:55.684 --> 35:57.755
Fan out! Fan out!

35:57.756 --> 36:01.158
We need to evacuate every
single house in this neighborhood.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.830
And until we find the
source of those chemicals,

36:02.831 --> 36:05.162
proceed with caution.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.766
(Wailing continues)

36:08.767 --> 36:12.169
(Man) Take your
team around back!

36:12.170 --> 36:14.772
(Man) Somebody
knock on this door.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.704
(Man) And I got a guest house.

36:16.705 --> 36:18.906
(Police radio chatter)

36:18.907 --> 36:21.209
Mr. Kaiser.

36:21.210 --> 36:22.880
(Radio chatter continues)

36:22.881 --> 36:25.853
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

36:25.854 --> 36:27.655
Philly pd.

36:27.656 --> 36:28.786
(Man) Check the garage.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.758
(Man) And across the street!

36:30.759 --> 36:32.860
(Morris) Anybody home?

36:32.861 --> 36:34.722
Hey, bud. What?

36:34.723 --> 36:37.665
Look at these flowers in front.

36:37.666 --> 36:38.766
Yeah?

36:38.767 --> 36:40.668
Yeah, now check out
these over on the side.

36:40.669 --> 36:43.731
They're the exact same
flowers, but they're turning green.

36:43.732 --> 36:45.233
They're a different color. So?

36:45.234 --> 36:47.235
When anhydrous ammonia
escapes into the air,

36:47.236 --> 36:48.976
it can change the
color of flowers to green.

36:48.977 --> 36:50.978
Somebody's cooking
meth around here.

36:50.979 --> 36:54.943
That's what the neighbors
have been breathing in.

36:56.785 --> 36:58.886
(Man) All right. Let's go!

36:58.887 --> 37:00.988
(Police radio chatter)

37:00.989 --> 37:04.723
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

37:15.834 --> 37:16.964
Philly pd!

37:16.965 --> 37:18.766
Hands in the air, kaiser.

37:18.767 --> 37:20.007
In the air. Higher.

37:20.008 --> 37:22.940
Get on your knees. Lace
your hands behind your head.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.973
Get on your knees! Now!

37:27.776 --> 37:29.817
We found the red
shop towel you used

37:29.818 --> 37:31.018
to incapacitate Daniel Davidson.

37:31.019 --> 37:32.820
And the pattern on your gloves

37:32.821 --> 37:35.953
matches the ones we found
on the rear bumper of his car.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.827
It's time to come clean, Kevin.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.732
(Grunts)

37:44.993 --> 37:47.035
I, um...

37:50.268 --> 37:52.800
I lost my job a year ago.

37:52.801 --> 37:54.842
And, uh...

37:54.843 --> 37:56.043
(Inhales deeply)

37:56.044 --> 37:59.307
(Exhales) I couldn't
get hired anywhere.

37:59.308 --> 38:02.950
We were deep in
debt, and I just...

38:02.951 --> 38:04.011
(Sighs)

38:04.012 --> 38:06.283
Unraveled.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.956
Quite a leap to
meth manufacturing.

38:08.957 --> 38:11.889
One of my cousins
used to be a dealer.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.891
He told me I could get
out of the hole I was in

38:13.892 --> 38:16.293
by cooking meth.

38:16.294 --> 38:20.768
I thought maybe if I
could right myself, I...

38:20.769 --> 38:22.930
I could get things back
to the way they used to be.

38:22.931 --> 38:25.032
How did Daniel find out?

38:25.033 --> 38:27.034
It was so early in the morning,

38:27.035 --> 38:30.037
i-i... I never expected
anyone to hear me.

38:30.038 --> 38:32.780
But he was coming
home from Vicki's house.

38:32.781 --> 38:35.012
Suddenly, he was
just there in the shed,

38:35.013 --> 38:37.314
asking me what
the hell I was doing.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.847
Are you aware that

38:39.848 --> 38:41.989
the waste product
from your meth lab

38:41.990 --> 38:44.051
has contaminated
the air and soil

38:44.052 --> 38:45.993
of the entire neighborhood?

38:45.994 --> 38:48.796
It's already killed
your neighbor's dog.

38:48.797 --> 38:50.898
If Daniel hadn't found out...

38:50.899 --> 38:54.002
How many people
would've been next?

38:55.804 --> 38:59.907
So you got the drop on
Daniel with the shop cloth and...

38:59.908 --> 39:02.911
I, um...

39:06.845 --> 39:09.076
I took his car out
into the woods,

39:09.077 --> 39:12.079
and, um...

39:12.080 --> 39:15.023
I pushed it over.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.127
(Voice breaks) I just, uh...

39:21.059 --> 39:22.860
(Sniffles)

39:22.861 --> 39:25.092
(Exhales)

39:25.093 --> 39:29.367
I couldn't have anything
else taken away from me.

39:35.944 --> 39:39.376
(Indistinct conversations)

39:39.377 --> 39:42.149
Oh-ho. I just heard. A meth lab?

39:42.150 --> 39:43.951
What do you want, Ethan?

39:43.952 --> 39:45.953
Well, if you're going
back to the police station,

39:45.954 --> 39:47.154
could you return these for me?

39:47.155 --> 39:48.155
Oh.
