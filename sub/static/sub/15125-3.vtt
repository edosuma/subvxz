WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:04.472
Dinner!

00:04.505 --> 00:07.808
Ooh, I love
International Taco Night.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.143
VIRGINIA
We have...

00:09.177 --> 00:11.145
French fries, Greek yogurt,

00:11.179 --> 00:13.514
Canadian bacon,
Chinese noodles,

00:13.547 --> 00:14.882
Italian sausage,
American cheese,

00:14.915 --> 00:18.018
and from the country
of Chile, chili.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.420
Kind of just seems like
we're eating all the food

00:19.453 --> 00:20.554
in the fridge
that was about to go bad.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.090
Yes, but in a taco shell.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.592
This is like the buffet
at the United Nations

00:24.625 --> 00:26.026
without all the grab-ass.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.928
Hope, look,
these noodles

00:27.961 --> 00:29.563
were made all
the way in China

00:29.597 --> 00:31.399
by little girls
the same age as you.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.766
You know, in China,

00:32.800 --> 00:33.834
they actually eat
a completely different

00:33.867 --> 00:35.103
kind of noodle
than we have here.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.704
I don't want to sound racist,

00:36.737 --> 00:38.339
but I kind of think
all Chinese noodles look alike.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.873
Yeah. I'm just saying.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.342
My family used to travel a lot
when I was a kid.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.544
China, Argentina,
Australia...

00:43.577 --> 00:45.846
When I was a kid,
I learned to keep my mouth shut

00:45.879 --> 00:47.615
and not be such
an annoying know-it-all.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.284
You know, we went on a lot of
trips when I was little, too.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.952
I should, uh, show you the
vacation photos after dinner.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.054
Uh, that's a terrible idea.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.290
Nobody likes to look at
other people's vacation photos.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.259
Besides, those pictures
don't exist anymore.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.360
BURT:
Yeah.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.794
They melted in a...

01:00.828 --> 01:03.864
Strangely contained
shelf fire?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.133
Are you sure?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.900
I thought I saw them
a couple days ago.

01:06.934 --> 01:07.768
Uh...

01:07.801 --> 01:08.869
Are these supposed to be

01:08.902 --> 01:11.239
hard or soft shell tacos?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.540
That's a napkin, Maw Maw.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.676
What will those Mexicans
think of next?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.313
Mmm.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.116
* Whoo!

01:22.150 --> 01:23.751
* Here we go

01:23.784 --> 01:26.920
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:26.954 --> 01:29.657
And that is when we went
to Lake World.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.593
Oh, man, the catfish show
was amazing.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.994
Look at you,
all tuckered out.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.496
(laughs)

01:35.529 --> 01:37.165
Oh, and this is when we
went skiing in Vermont.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.600
We stayed in this big cabin
next to Ben and Jerry.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.968
No, not the
ice cream guys,

01:41.001 --> 01:42.236
just a gay couple
on vacation.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.771
SABRINA:
You're asleep again.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.573
Yeah, I always used to get
carsick on vacations,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.074
so my parents would
give me medicine

01:47.107 --> 01:48.676
and it would make
me kind of drowsy.
Oh.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.411
We had to choose between
a puker and a sleeper.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.679
We chose sleeper.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.281
Hey, not to change the subject,

01:53.314 --> 01:54.815
but is it just me,

01:54.848 --> 01:57.451
or is there a lot more
Velcro on stuff lately?

01:58.686 --> 02:01.088
Yeah, what is this
brown stain in the sky?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.757
Storm cloud.
I'm starting to get a weird
feeling in my stomach.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.194
There's a rip
in the side of this mountain.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.695
Of course there is.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.963
That's Rip Mountain.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.299
Oh, my God.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.833
These are all fake.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.034
Fine.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.303
Some of them are fake.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.637
But the first one's real.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.971
When you were little,
all the other kids

02:18.005 --> 02:19.373
were bragging about
going to Lake World,

02:19.407 --> 02:20.774
so we took you.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.443
But you got carsick,
so we gave you medicine.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.877
Not only did it knock you out
for the drive,

02:23.911 --> 02:25.179
you slept through
the whole day.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.380
VIRGINIA:
And the next morning,

02:26.414 --> 02:27.815
all you could talk about

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
was what a great time
you had at Lake World.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.319
So we figured, why stop there?

02:31.352 --> 02:34.021
Why not give you great memories
of seeing the whole country?

02:34.054 --> 02:35.122
Drink up, honey.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.291
It's a long drive
to Hawaii.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.893
Once you were in dreamland,

02:39.927 --> 02:42.029
we'd just drive across town
to the Dumpster

02:42.062 --> 02:43.331
behind the photography studio.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.168
BURT:
I did landscaping nearby,

02:48.202 --> 02:51.004
so every time I saw them
throw out a backdrop,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.173
we knew it was vacation time.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.717
VIRGINIA:
We went everywhere.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.419
We gave Jimmy the greatest

03:05.453 --> 03:07.288
imaginary childhood
a kid could have.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.004
So you're telling me
I never used the toilet

03:24.037 --> 03:25.273
that Elvis died on?

03:26.307 --> 03:27.841
I mean, I still
brag about that!

03:27.875 --> 03:29.610
Shh. It's okay, Jimmy.
It's okay.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.945
It's all water
under the Brooklyn Bridge.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.381
Which we now know
you never actually saw.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.548
The important thing is that

03:34.582 --> 03:36.250
we're gonna work harder
for Hope.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.451
We worked pretty hard.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.619
I just mean
we're gonna take her

03:38.652 --> 03:39.620
on a real vacation.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.689
Oh. A "real" vacation.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.024
Good luck with that on two
grocery baggers' salaries.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.058
Ha.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.226
It doesn't have
to be fancy,

03:46.260 --> 03:47.361
as long as
we're together.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.262
And awake.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.930
It's not worth it.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.232
Family vacations just get
everybody out of sync.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.401
She's right.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.868
It's nothing but
driving and sunburns

03:54.902 --> 03:56.437
and a whole lot
of fighting.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.938
How would you know?
You never took us anywhere.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.273
See?
We're already fighting.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.275
Pretty soon
we're gonna be sunburned.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.377
Maybe we didn't
give Jimmy real vacations.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.746
But we gave him
real memories.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.648
And that's all kids remember

04:07.681 --> 04:10.951
from vacations anyway...
is memories.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.420
And now all Jimmy's memories
are ruined.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.488
Thank you, Helen Keller.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.756
I don't think that's
who you think it is.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.124
The girl detective.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.759
You're thinking of
Amelia Earhart.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.462
Nancy Drew.
You're thinking of Nancy Drew.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.830
Doesn't ring a bell.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.598
It's not important.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.401
The fact is, Jimmy was happy,
well-traveled and ignorant,

04:27.435 --> 04:29.970
and you just took away
two of those things.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.412
I hate to think
your mother is right,

04:38.446 --> 04:41.482
but all the vacations in here
cost thousands of dollars.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.351
Have you looked
into a cougar cruise?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.118
It's three nights
on the Caribbean.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.754
It's pretty wild.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.255
JIMMY: Frank, we're trying
to plan a family vacation,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.123
not have sex with older women.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.826
No, these are actual
live cougars.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.596
You sail the high seas
with them.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.799
It's loosely based off that
hilarious movie Life of Pi.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.434
But it is a cruise,

05:00.468 --> 05:03.270
so... there are
a lot of older women,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.438
if you're into that.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.873
Check this out.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.875
I mean, it's no cougar cruise,

05:07.908 --> 05:09.543
but at least it's
still a boat trip.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.711
"Travel and make money."

05:10.744 --> 05:12.145
Oh, that sounds cool.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.714
You know what else is cool?

05:13.747 --> 05:16.384
Not talking about the awesome
trips you're gonna take

05:16.417 --> 05:19.052
in front of someone
you haven't invited.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.988
Yet.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.628
Guess what.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.129
You guys were wrong.
Shh.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.564
Sabrina found us
a great vacation.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.065
Shh.
Shh.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.834
Can't you see we're
doing a teeth cleaning?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.202
If you startle
Maw Maw awake,

05:35.235 --> 05:37.004
one of us could
lose a finger.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.407
Hey, look.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.677
It's the little iron
from the Monopoly set.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.713
We haven't played
in over a year.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.481
We should really
floss her more often.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.182
We came over here
to invite you guys

05:49.216 --> 05:50.584
on a real
family vacation.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.019
One that will take place
outside of an alley

05:52.052 --> 05:53.587
and nowhere near
a Dumpster.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.722
Let me check my calendar.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.756
Pass.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.990
BURT:
You guys have fun.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.992
We got our paradise
right here.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.429
Look, it's a game
board bonanza.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.497
Think I found Colonel
Mustard's candlestick.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.499
No. That's just a filling.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.034
JIMMY: You guys sure
you don't want to go

06:07.067 --> 06:08.201
on this vacation with us?

06:08.235 --> 06:09.570
Look, this rich
Vanderklam family

06:09.603 --> 06:12.205
is paying us 500 bucks
to go sail their boat

06:12.239 --> 06:13.507
down the river to
the Fulton Marina.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.775
SABRINA:
Then we're gonna use

06:14.808 --> 06:16.209
that money on
two nights at a hotel

06:16.243 --> 06:17.445
and train tickets
back to Natesville.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.580
You thinking what I'm thinking?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.781
Boat sex?

06:20.814 --> 06:21.882
Excuse me?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.517
Did you just
say "boat sex"?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.586
We've got this whole
"transportation sex" checklist

06:25.619 --> 06:26.587
we're plowing through.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.789
Ooh, a plow!

06:28.822 --> 06:30.123
Is that even on the list?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.258
It is now. (chuckles)

06:31.291 --> 06:32.626
This all started years ago

06:32.660 --> 06:34.528
when your mom and I
snuck a ride on a bus.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.197
We should wait for a bumpy
section of highway

06:37.230 --> 06:39.132
and let the road
do all the work.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.001
You're so smart.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.407
Thanks, Dale.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.610
(whooping)

06:53.447 --> 06:54.715
(both laugh)

06:54.748 --> 06:56.383
Well, uh...

06:56.416 --> 06:57.985
I was hoping that
you'd want to come with

06:58.018 --> 06:59.419
to be part of
our family memories.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.088
Oh, definitely.
We're in.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.757
We are gonna have
front-row seats

07:03.791 --> 07:05.225
for this vacation disaster.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.894
Okay, that's it.

07:06.927 --> 07:07.728
Get the pickle.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.930
(Maw Maw snoring)

07:12.132 --> 07:14.334
Oh...

07:14.367 --> 07:16.937
That's how Paw Paw
used to wake me up.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.271
Of course, his pickle

07:18.305 --> 07:20.874
was smaller
and smelled a lot worse.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.413
Hi.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.482
Uh, we're here to take
the Vanderklams' boat

07:28.516 --> 07:29.750
to the Fulton Marina.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.018
(laughs):
Oh...

07:31.051 --> 07:32.486
I like how you dressed the part.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
It's not often you see
folks get so decked out

07:34.522 --> 07:36.256
just to tow a boat
down the highway.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.691
We're towing it?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.760
We... Are you kidding me?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.361
I thought we were gonna
take it out on the water.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.531
And I thought Jimmy Buffett
was a good role model.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.732
Have a great trip.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.367
Aw, man.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.369
Bet carsick medicine
sounds real good now.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.771
VIRGINIA:
You two just give the signal,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.574
and it's nighty-night juice
all around.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.279
Now, on the flyer, the boat is
clearly not on a trailer.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.014
It's highly misleading.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.282
Well, nothing like this
ever happened

08:02.315 --> 08:04.151
when we took Jimmy
on vacations.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.353
Nothing happened because being
unconscious is not a vacation.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.555
I beg to differ.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.956
Now, it looks like there's

08:08.989 --> 08:10.691
a Stuffed Animal Museum
right on the way,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.392
and that'd be
a great memory for Hope.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.794
Burt and I will ride
on the boat.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.395
Just to give you two
some privacy.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.630
I'll grab the champagne
and the boombox

08:16.664 --> 08:18.131
out of the back
of the car,

08:18.165 --> 08:19.332
we'll set sail.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.467
No, no.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.835
No one is allowed
in the boat.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.637
Didn't you read
the contract?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.305
Oh, yeah,
I read every word.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.007
That's why my daughter's wearing
a snorkel on a road trip.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.076
Is there anything else
I might've missed?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.178
If you don't get the boat
there by 4:00 p.m.,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.580
you forfeit
half the money.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.815
(snorts)
Right.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.750
So that means
we had to leave, what?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.518
30 minutes ago?

08:39.587 --> 08:40.588
Everyone get in the car.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.922
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:50.764 --> 08:52.099
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.300
Sorry.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.503
Can we please stop
the car, Sabrina?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.905
We've been holding it
for five hours.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.240
We're supposed
to be holding it?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.374
That's news to me.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.776
Me, too.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.444
We're gonna stop
at the next gas station.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.179
That's what you said about
the last five gas stations.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.380
The next gas station
that has room

09:07.414 --> 09:08.415
for a boat to go
in and out of it.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.050
Just hang in there.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.284
It looks like there's one
coming up in about a mile.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.385
Hey, the Stuffed
Animal Museum's

09:12.419 --> 09:13.621
coming up in
about a mile.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.788
We're gonna be
stopped right by it.

09:14.822 --> 09:15.923
Okay, Jimmy,
delivering the boat

09:15.956 --> 09:17.691
is our priority
right now.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.459
Just wanted to make sure you
didn't forget about the museum.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.194
It's hard to forget about it
when you mention it ten times.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.730
Sounds like somebody's getting
a little out of sync.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.231
JIMMY and SABRINA:
We're not out of sync!

09:24.264 --> 09:25.633
Please don't say "sink."

09:25.666 --> 09:28.468
Or the name of anything else
I have ever peed in.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.348
Go quickly.
We only have ten minutes.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.093
Okay.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.561
Come on.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.230
What...?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.398
Where the hell
is the car?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.167
Hey, between
you and me,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.135
this vacation's starting
to get interesting.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.242
Wha...? What?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.778
This doesn't make
any sense.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.579
Why would somebody take the car
but leave the boat?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.447
Because nobody wants
to tow a boat?

10:14.481 --> 10:16.349
Nothing like this ever happened
to us at Rip Mountain.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.450
MAW MAW:
It's a sign.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.485
First we gather two

10:18.518 --> 10:19.586
of every kind of animal.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.888
Then we wait.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.857
SABRINA:
Okay, I got this.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.759
Jimmy, I just want you
to take Hope and Maw Maw

10:25.793 --> 10:27.127
and go into
the Stuffed Animal Museum, okay?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.428
I'm gonna
call the cops.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.629
Don't worry, everybody.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.931
There's still
plenty of time

10:30.964 --> 10:32.933
to make some happy
family memories, okay?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.601
Our car was just stolen.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.203
I don't want to leave you
on your own to deal with this.

10:36.236 --> 10:40.173
Jimmy...
we came here to have fun,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.042
and we are gonna
have fun, damn it.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.543
So take the kid

10:43.576 --> 10:45.612
and take the crazy old lady,

10:45.645 --> 10:46.814
and go in there

10:46.847 --> 10:48.716
and make some happy memories!

10:48.749 --> 10:50.283
Okay?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.952
All right.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.620
Let's go make some memories!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.588
Let's make memories!

10:57.691 --> 11:00.093
Watch the boat.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.063
What are you doing?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.399
No punk car thief is gonna
take down my vacation.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.772
If I'm not back in five minutes,
forward my mail to Hell.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.142
I'm just kidding.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.911
If I'm not back in five minutes,
please call an ambulance.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.418
I tried to warn her.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.520
Vacations are a disaster.

11:27.554 --> 11:32.325
Hey, we have that boat
all to ourselves.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.526
She said watch the boat.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.995
Didn't say watch it
from outside.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.063
(chuckles)

11:36.096 --> 11:37.765
Come on... whoa!

11:37.798 --> 11:38.966
Uh...

11:43.236 --> 11:46.373
Good enough for Jimmy's crib,
good enough for a boat.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.676
OLD MAN: Welcome to
the Stuffed Animal Museum.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.944
A menagerie

11:50.978 --> 11:54.247
of wonders and merriment
for all ages.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.383
All right, well, one adult,
one child

11:56.416 --> 11:57.517
and one senior, please.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.887
Oh...

11:59.920 --> 12:02.522
seniors are free.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.924
Of course.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.592
'Cause we're not
real people anymore,

12:05.625 --> 12:08.862
just clothes
and skin holding in farts.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.899
Aren't you delightful!

12:11.932 --> 12:15.235
You don't look
a day over 85.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.437
Likewise.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.807
Once you've gone
through the tour,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.875
why don't we just, uh,

12:21.909 --> 12:24.277
take our teeth out
and see what happens.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.880
(both laughing)

12:26.914 --> 12:28.982
Not to interrupt
this disgusting interaction,

12:29.016 --> 12:31.284
but my four-year-old
is real anxious

12:31.318 --> 12:32.619
to go see the
stuffed animals.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.955
I believe
you mean to say "excited."

12:34.988 --> 12:37.490
"Anxious" means
"filled with anxiety."

12:37.524 --> 12:39.927
These kids today and
their grammar.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.395
Okay, once inside, just follow

12:42.429 --> 12:45.332
the yellow paw prints on the
floor to guide you through.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.533
(clicks tongue)

12:47.700 --> 12:48.768
Enjoy.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.437
All right.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.910
We're gonna go through...

12:56.944 --> 12:58.078
You ready, Hope?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.479
This is gonna be awesome.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.581
(Jimmy shrieks)

13:01.614 --> 13:03.851
Not the cute
kind of stuffed animals!

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
Not cute!

13:06.719 --> 13:08.288
(grunting)

13:08.321 --> 13:09.356
It won't spin this way.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.757
Help!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.592
There's been some kind of
misunderstanding.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.094
Would you let us out!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.796
(amplified): Please follow
the yellow paw prints.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.431
Thank you and enjoy.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.368
(whimpering) Maw Maw, help me
get Hope out of here.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.338
Shh! I'm in a staring
contest with this owl.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.186
(rock music blaring over radio)

13:43.356 --> 13:45.025
Hey...
(grunting)

13:45.058 --> 13:48.628
I came here to deliver a boat
and have a nice vacation.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.697
And right now,
I'm all out of vacation.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.632
What does that even mean?
(laughs)

13:52.665 --> 13:54.201
(groans)

13:54.234 --> 13:56.103
(spits)

14:02.009 --> 14:03.543
(wolf howling over P.A.)

14:03.576 --> 14:05.145
It's okay, Hope.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.680
We're just playing a long,
creepy game of peek-a-boo.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.983
(Jimmy gasps, whimpers)

14:10.017 --> 14:11.484
I am gonna write
a very negative

14:11.518 --> 14:12.852
online review of your museum!

14:12.886 --> 14:14.922
(amplified):
Go ahead, I'll delete it.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.890
Well, then
I'll write another one!

14:16.924 --> 14:19.659
(amplified):
Then I'll delete that one, too.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.228
(Jimmy whimpers)

14:21.261 --> 14:24.197
Fine! Then I'll probably
give up at that point.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.433
But I'll still be very upset!

14:28.902 --> 14:30.803
(screaming)

14:31.704 --> 14:34.274
(screaming)

14:36.109 --> 14:37.510
Jimmy!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.678
Get this guy's card.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.679
He's good.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.048
I was thinking cremation,

14:41.081 --> 14:43.183
but if he can make
this old bat look good,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.318
imagine what he could do for me.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.923
(plastic squeaking,
Virginia moaning)

14:53.793 --> 14:54.928
Ah...

14:54.962 --> 14:56.463
Burt, what's going on?

14:56.496 --> 14:59.299
I think I'm having
a little problem.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.900
Do we have to get those pills

15:00.934 --> 15:03.403
where we sit in bathtubs
in a field?

15:03.436 --> 15:05.472
No, I think I'm just distracted

15:05.505 --> 15:07.640
by these pictures of
this family on vacation.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.442
I'm wondering if we could've
done better for Jimmy.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.979
Burt, these people
are "boat rich."

15:12.012 --> 15:13.613
Of course they had
fancy vacations.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.315
But they're not
all fancy vacations.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.250
They went hiking,
they went to the beach.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.718
They went fishing
at Natesville Lake.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.886
That's closer to our house
than the Dumpster

15:19.919 --> 15:21.588
behind the photo studio.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.457
(scoffs) Next you're gonna say
you think Sabrina was right.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.325
No, no, no, no.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.060
No!
(laughing)

15:27.094 --> 15:28.761
No.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.797
Maybe.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.165
Maybe?

15:32.199 --> 15:33.766
Not a definite maybe.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.068
A maybe-ish maybe.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.936
So...

15:36.970 --> 15:38.671
you're saying I'm wrong?

15:38.705 --> 15:39.839
Maybe?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.442
Maybe you're saying that,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.844
or maybe I'm wrong?

15:44.877 --> 15:47.814
Or...

15:47.847 --> 15:50.817
maybe you're the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

15:50.850 --> 15:55.022
Maybe you should have
boat sex by yourself.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.424
No, Virginia, I've already
done that on a boat.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.826
Come on! Virginia!

16:00.994 --> 16:03.130
Virginia, wait!
(car tires screeching)

16:05.065 --> 16:06.599
I got the car back.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.867
You guys...

16:07.900 --> 16:08.868
what are you doing?

16:08.901 --> 16:10.270
Look who saved the day

16:10.303 --> 16:12.139
chasing thieves
on her stolen motorcycle.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.706
Little Miss
Right About Everything.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.009
I never said
she was right about everything.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.777
For God's sake,
she married Jimmy.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.879
This is officially
the worst vacation ever.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.314
SABRINA:
Excuse me?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.950
I have done absolutely
everything I can do

16:23.983 --> 16:26.719
to give this family something
that they've never had before.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.121
A stolen motorcycle?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.123
No. A vacation.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.391
You stole a motorcycle?

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
To get the car back.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.361
Jimmy, it was
a selfless act of heroism

16:34.394 --> 16:36.729
so you could enjoy your time
at the teddy bear museum.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.730
They were not teddy bears.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.731
They were stuffed animals.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.732
Real animals.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.000
Eating other animals.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.735
Hope's going
to be scarred for life.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.939
I pilfered this antelope,
so the day wasn't a total loss.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.210
You're right, Burt,
we messed up.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.679
When Jimmy was a kid, we should
have taken him on vacation,

16:52.712 --> 16:55.548
stolen a motorcycle and gone
to the museum of nightmares.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.417
Those would've been way better
vacation memories

16:57.450 --> 16:58.685
than we ever gave him.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.153
It's not about
what we gave Jimmy.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.588
We did the best we could
with what we had.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.323
I can live with that.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.525
But they could do better with
Hope if we're on their side,

17:05.558 --> 17:06.926
not rooting against them.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.861
JIMMY: ...a motorcycle ride
would've been fun.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.263
SABRINA:
You know what, you guys?

17:10.297 --> 17:14.201
Let's just hitch up
the boat and drop it off,

17:14.234 --> 17:15.668
then we can all just go home.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.239
Hey, Jimmy, I always
suspected you fancied boys,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.608
but when did you start
advertising it?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.243
What are you talking about?

17:23.276 --> 17:26.679
Your bumper sticker says,
"I'd rather be spelunking."

17:26.713 --> 17:28.381
This is not our car.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.518
(siren whoops)

17:31.551 --> 17:32.452
(gasps)

17:35.722 --> 17:38.458
Which one of you assaulted
this man and stole his vehicle?

17:38.491 --> 17:39.459
What?

17:39.492 --> 17:40.793
Hold this for me.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.563
No reason both of us
have to go to jail.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.570
Look, honestly,
it's-it's such an easy mistake.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.372
Our-our cars are
the exact same color...

17:52.405 --> 17:53.740
She assaulted me!

17:53.773 --> 17:55.642
Do you know how swollen
my testicles are?

17:55.675 --> 17:57.910
We'll never know
unless you show us.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.215
That psycho from
the Stuffed Animal Museum

18:02.249 --> 18:03.916
is the real criminal!

18:03.950 --> 18:06.653
Those deviants didn't even
follow the yellow paw prints!

18:06.686 --> 18:08.955
They went right out
the fire exit!

18:08.988 --> 18:10.923
You cuff 'em,
I'll stuff 'em!

18:10.957 --> 18:12.559
Everybody quiet down.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.993
Put your hands
behind your back, miss.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.428
You're arresting me?

18:15.462 --> 18:17.430
Look, my only crime
is caring too much.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.399
I mean, sure,
assault and grand theft auto,

18:19.432 --> 18:20.833
but mostly just caring too much.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.170
Look, I just really wanted
to give my daughter

18:23.203 --> 18:24.437
a fun vacation memory.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.672
VIRGINIA:
If you're gonna arrest her,

18:25.705 --> 18:27.274
you're gonna
have to arrest me, too.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.342
Why?
She wouldn't have
had to do any of this

18:29.376 --> 18:30.743
if I just tried harder

18:30.777 --> 18:32.679
to give my granddaughter
a real vacation.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.915
Well, if that little cutie
is your granddaughter,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.317
you're missing it.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.286
Hey, Gram!

18:39.319 --> 18:42.322
I'm driving a boat.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.290
Hope!

18:43.323 --> 18:44.457
Please, can you just wait

18:44.491 --> 18:45.858
one second to arrest me?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.694
I just... I really want
to get this on video.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.396
Okay. Stay there.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.132
Come on, Hope,
let's make a memor... (screams)

18:55.868 --> 18:57.103
Oh, yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.372
Same thing happened
with Jimmy's crib.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.841
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Cardiology, 3128. Cardiology...

19:01.874 --> 19:03.776
Oh. Am I in jail?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.178
No.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.046
You hit your head;
you're in the hospital.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.315
BURT:
Good news is,

19:08.348 --> 19:09.682
when they saw you
flopping around

19:09.716 --> 19:11.150
on the ground like
a fish out of water,

19:11.184 --> 19:12.652
they felt too bad
to press charges.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.387
Oh, that's good news.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.822
Oh, on the flip side,

19:15.855 --> 19:18.358
I just gave Hope
the worst vacation ever.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.026
I don't think
she feels that way.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.228
Look at this.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.068
(laughing)

19:32.705 --> 19:35.074
You put me up on the boat
while I was unconscious?

19:35.107 --> 19:36.543
Hey, I mean, you planned
the whole thing.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.378
We weren't gonna leave
you out of the videos.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.480
And holding you upright kept you
from swallowing your tongue

19:40.513 --> 19:41.814
till the ambulance got there.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.082
Check these out.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.818
Catfish!

19:45.852 --> 19:47.254
Whoa! Catch it!

19:47.287 --> 19:48.588
Whoa!

19:48.621 --> 19:50.189
Oh...

20:00.199 --> 20:02.469
(laughs)
Whoa!

20:05.605 --> 20:07.073
Eh? That's good, right?

20:07.106 --> 20:09.976
Oh, I'm glad Hope
had a good time.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.879
Virginia, you were so right.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.182
Having a real vacation is
more trouble than it's worth.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.617
Well, this trip was awful.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.952
This was more of a crime
spree than a trip.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
But next year,
we could do better

20:23.089 --> 20:24.757
if we all work together.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.560
And who knows, maybe someday
the Chances will take a vacation

20:27.594 --> 20:29.729
where one of us isn't
passed out in every picture.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.398
I would really like that.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.832
But no more boats.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.068
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Aah!

20:36.102 --> 20:38.070
Jimmy, how did
I get so sunburned?

20:38.104 --> 20:41.007
I may have forgotten to
put your sunscreen on.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.476
(groans)

20:43.510 --> 20:45.645
Hey, I'm proud of you.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.980
I know how hard it is for you
to admit you're wrong.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.115
No, it isn't.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.517
I totally agree.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.288
Too bad there's no boat here.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.489
Oh, that's okay.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.825
Plenty of other vehicles
in the sea.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.835
Let's go! We have a spelunker
with a ruptured testicle!

21:12.972 --> 21:14.841
(siren wailing)

21:14.874 --> 21:17.209
(gentle classical music playing)

21:19.278 --> 21:21.280
It's so nice to dance
with something

21:21.314 --> 21:24.183
that still has a pulse.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.618
Dinner was lovely.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.187
The chicken was delicious!

21:28.220 --> 21:30.490
That's because
it wasn't chicken.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.525
It was meerkat.
