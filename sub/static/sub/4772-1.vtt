00:15.891 --> 00:19.394
You guys,
I'm really gonna miss this place.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.604
Me too.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.733
Hey, let's all promise
that in ten years from today,

00:24.816 --> 00:27.986
we'll meet again and we'll see
what kind of people we've blossomed into.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.071
Yeah!

00:29.154 --> 00:30.614
- I'll be here.
- I wouldn't miss it.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.467
- What time you wanna meet?
- You mean ten years from now?

00:32.491 --> 00:33.742
Yeah.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.203
Let's meet in the morning
so we can make a day of it.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.665
Okay, so what is it?
Is it, like, 9:00 or 9:30?

00:39.748 --> 00:42.417
Well, let's say 9:00.
That way, we can be here by 9:30.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.728
- That makes sense.
- Definitely.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.965
Well, no, why don't we say 9:30 and then
make it your beeswax to be here at 9:30?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.488
We're gonna be in our late 20s then.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.052
I just don't see any reason
why we can't be places on time.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.264
Okay, then. It's settled. 9:30 it is.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.557
- All agreed?
- Agreed.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.849
- Yeah.
- Agreed.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.601
Great, 'cause I have something at 11:00.

00:59.685 --> 01:03.021
[scoffs] You just got a Trapper Keeper
full of appointments, right?

01:03.105 --> 01:05.025
No, I have something at 11:00
that I can't change

01:05.107 --> 01:06.441
'cause I already moved it twice.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.015
[Katie] This is on the right track,

01:21.039 --> 01:23.500
but I think we need more of a classic feel
to fit the brand.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.224
Lose that, lose that, move this up there.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.380
Circle that, circle that,
move this here, that there,

01:28.463 --> 01:30.441
these up top, these underneath
and then flip it. Got it?

01:30.465 --> 01:33.218
- You got it, Katie.
- Good. Then circle that, circle that.

01:33.302 --> 01:37.389
Put that up there, move this, move that,
this and that, these and those,

01:37.472 --> 01:39.766
that and that, all of that, all of this.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.852
This, that, that, that, that and that.

01:41.935 --> 01:42.853
- Katie, does this...
- No.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.816
Any new thoughts
on what the fall color will be?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.231
I'm still trying to crack it.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.900
It's like I can see it
in the corner of my mind's eye,

01:48.984 --> 01:51.528
and then I turn and look, and it's gone.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.615
- [dance music playing]
- [crowd cheering]

01:59.536 --> 02:01.538
Whoo!

02:01.622 --> 02:03.624
- Oh! [Laughs]
- [women cheering]

02:06.710 --> 02:08.419
Oh! [Laughing]

02:11.173 --> 02:14.801
Three deep at the bar!
This place is rockin' and a-sockin'!

02:14.885 --> 02:17.220
You're the man, Victor! Whoo!

02:17.304 --> 02:19.931
Upper East Side, baby, is where it's at!
[chuckles]

02:20.015 --> 02:22.392
- Snap, crackle, and pop!
- [song changes]

02:22.476 --> 02:24.895
- [both] Oh!
- That's my cue!

02:25.937 --> 02:27.356
[women cheering]

02:30.233 --> 02:33.070
Everybody, look! Look at him!

02:38.700 --> 02:41.953
And table 45 is up. There you go.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.749
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.668
Presentation is everything.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.629
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

02:52.339 --> 02:53.465
- Perfect.
- [chuckles]

03:06.144 --> 03:08.313
- I can't let you rent that.
- Is it reserved?

03:08.397 --> 03:13.026
I have a moral obligation to prevent
any further decay of romantic expectations

03:13.110 --> 03:16.696
provided by the fallacy perpetuated
by Hollywood romantic comedies.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.491
Also, it's very derivative of <i>Annie Hall.</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:21.159
I'm going to Tower Video.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.828
Great!

03:23.453 --> 03:26.706
Why don't you go to a B. Dalton Bookseller
on the way, while you're at it?

03:31.169 --> 03:36.133
Honey! I need an eight-letter word
that means a place where clothes are kept.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.094
- Huh. Vestiary?
- Hmm.

03:40.262 --> 03:44.307
Speaking of vestiaries, I cleared out
a whole bedroom closet for you to use.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.268
I told you, I only need one drawer.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.813
Oh, come on! Look at that thing, Claire.
It's stuffed to the brim!

03:49.896 --> 03:51.496
We've been dating since we were at camp.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.775
How embarrassing will it be
if we show up to the reunion

03:53.859 --> 03:55.652
and we're still just hangin' out?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.029
When are we gonna take the next step?

03:58.113 --> 04:01.450
Mark, you know how important
maintaining my independence is.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.244
You mean maintaining that flea-trap studio
down in the Village.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.747
- Well, it's my flea trap.
- [sighs]

04:06.830 --> 04:11.001
Who says that we have to move in together
or get hitched to prove we're committed?

04:11.084 --> 04:15.005
Oh, I don't know. Society? Community?
The general public?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.298
My parents!

04:17.798 --> 04:20.844
[Lindsay] Ready? Are we rolling yet?
Here we go. Let's go.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.598
On today's "Puff Stuff,"
doggy treats gone gourmet?

04:24.681 --> 04:28.310
These East Side chefs
think it could be something to bark about.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.188
I'll have the full report on <i>News at Noon.</i>

04:32.063 --> 04:33.356
Okay? We got it.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.027
[alarm ringing]

04:37.903 --> 04:39.488
- Gonna miss the flight.
- [gasps]

04:41.114 --> 04:42.114
[sighs]

04:42.991 --> 04:44.743
Oh, my God. We're gonna miss the flight.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.912
Aw, my head!

04:46.995 --> 04:48.997
Counting Crows shows
at the Viper Room are fun,

04:49.080 --> 04:50.665
but the after-parties are deadly.

04:52.501 --> 04:57.172
Next time Eric Stoltz asks us
to do Jäger bombs, we say no.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.342
[baby cooing]

05:02.344 --> 05:06.848
Who's my little Ashley?
Who's my little Ashley?

05:06.932 --> 05:09.184
Hey, Ben, we gotta get packed up
and hit the road

05:09.267 --> 05:11.603
if we're gonna make it to camp
before lunch.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.523
You know traffic on 95 is gonna be a bear.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.359
- Ben!
- Huh?

05:17.692 --> 05:20.195
[sighs] Sorry, I was lost in my work.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.323
These blueprints
are literally kicking my ass.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.368
They can kick your ass later.
We've got a reunion to get to.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.830
I can't believe it's been ten years
since our wedding at Firewood.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.916
- [sighs]
- What is it, babe?

05:32.999 --> 05:36.294
Well, none of them have seen me
since I got my nose job.

05:36.378 --> 05:40.006
You had a deviated septum.
You were snoring like crazy.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.594
It was a medical issue.
Besides, you look exactly the same to me.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
[sighs]

05:57.107 --> 06:02.195
Coop, I think this has the potential
to be a once-in-a-generation memoir

06:02.279 --> 06:04.864
that really captures the zeitgeist
of the early '90s.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.032
Yes, yes.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.870
But not yet,
because it still doesn't have an ending.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.038
I know, I know.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.750
But how am I supposed to write an ending
to a story I'm still living?

06:15.834 --> 06:18.503
That's something you're gonna have
to figure out on your own.

06:19.087 --> 06:23.049
Because without a boffo ending,
I can't sell this.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.970
No boffo.
It's the story of my life! [Scoffs]

06:27.053 --> 06:30.348
Look, take the weekend.
You're going up to this camp.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.935
You talk about it in the book.
Camp "Fi-rey-woad."

06:34.019 --> 06:35.061
Firewood.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.022
Maybe you can get
some inspiration up there.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.959
[man on radio]
<i>Good morning, New York City.</i>

06:39.983 --> 06:41.818
<i>It's 7:30 on a hot summer day</i>

06:41.901 --> 06:45.405
<i>and there's a pileup
on the BQE slowing traffic to a crawl.</i>

06:45.488 --> 06:47.574
Man, that was a long night.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.745
Whoo! I ask you, my friend,
is this not the life or what? Okay?

06:51.828 --> 06:55.248
I mean, getting paid to sling drinks
for horny coeds.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.416
- [laughing]
- What?

06:56.499 --> 06:59.002
You're the best, man.
Truly, the absolute greatest.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.421
Hey, I gotta ask you something.
Now that you're single,

07:01.504 --> 07:02.940
when are you gonna
take advantage of this position?

07:02.964 --> 07:05.425
- You gotta take advantage, man!
- What you talking about?

07:05.508 --> 07:10.055
I'm talking about the snizzy-lizzy,
the muffin stuff. Girls, Neil!

07:10.138 --> 07:14.184
- Come on! You gotta get your jack waxed.
- No, I don't think Shari would like that.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.646
Shari? She dumped you, man.
Who gives a flying shit what Shari...

07:17.729 --> 07:20.941
- Oh, hey, Shari.
- Hi, Victor. Hi, Neil.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.824
- Shari, what are you doing here?
- I called but your machine was full.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.504
I've got the rest of your stuff.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.906
Ooh, awkward. [Laughs]

07:28.657 --> 07:30.867
Hey, I'm gonna head upstairs
and finish packing.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.303
We're heading back to Camp Firewood

07:32.327 --> 07:36.581
for a little skunky, monkey,
funky, trunky junkie. [Laughing]

07:36.665 --> 07:38.917
- If you get my meaning.
- Always. Hands down.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.462
That's Vic. He's the greatest.
He's the best. Just one of a kind.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.839
They broke the mold, et cetera.
You know the drill.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.276
So, you guys are still doing
that ten year reunion thing, huh?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.469
Yeah, well, we made a promise to meet up.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.181
We don't just walk away
from our commitments to each other, Shari.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.549
Here's the rest of your stuff.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.895
It's your Apple PowerBook 100.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.456
- It's your inline skates.
- Love that.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.858
It's your beeper.
It's a bunch of other things from 1991.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.529
What happened to us, Shari?
What did I do wrong?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.572
You didn't do nothing, Neil.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.575
But I'm 26 now,
and I want more out of life

08:12.659 --> 08:15.328
than eating corn dogs
and watching horror flicks on your futon.

08:15.412 --> 08:20.875
So, you just dump me for some artsy-fartsy
fancy pants you met at an art gallery?

08:20.959 --> 08:23.128
His name is Brodfard Gilroy...

08:23.211 --> 08:25.547
- Oh!
- And he's cultured.

08:25.630 --> 08:29.801
He's a professor at Columbia University,
and he takes me places.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.761
Classy places. Places in Midtown.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.765
I've been to the opera, Neil.
Have you ever even heard of <i>Don Giovanni?</i>

08:36.850 --> 08:38.850
- Sure. That's... He's like...
- [tires screeching]

08:40.437 --> 08:43.231
Hey, you must be Neil.
I've heard so much about you.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.985
- Really?
- No. That's just a thing that people say.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.320
Come on, Shari,
we've got some motoring to do.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.365
Hey, Neil, I'm having
a little end-of-summer soirée

08:52.449 --> 08:55.493
at my country home up north later today.
You should stop by.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.996
Bye, Neil.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.961
[woman on radio] <i>WTOS,</i>
<i>New England's mountain of rock.</i>

09:05.045 --> 09:06.880
<i>Here's a classic from 1981.</i>

09:06.963 --> 09:09.758
<i>♪ Feel it coming like a tidal wave ♪</i>

Okay, we are all set.

09:21.853 --> 09:22.853
Hi!

09:23.480 --> 09:25.440
Hey! Are you Harriet?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.609
I must admit,
I was expecting someone a little older.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.862
No, I'm Renata.
Harriet called in sick at the last minute.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.197
I'm her replacement.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.240
[gasps] And this must be Ashley.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.992
Yes, she is!

09:36.826 --> 09:37.911
[whispers] Who is this?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.914
- I booked us a nanny for the weekend.
- What?

09:40.997 --> 09:42.040
Why?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.291
[sighs]

09:44.084 --> 09:47.962
- Would you give us a minute?
- Oh, my pleasure. Hi, Ashley.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.089
[both chuckle]

09:49.172 --> 09:51.841
What the hell, man?
You just handed our baby to a stranger.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.677
Mack, this nanny service is top-notch.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.514
And we'll get more time
to hang out with our friends.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.309
You deserve it. We both deserve it.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.703
Ben, you have no idea
how much is involved.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.562
We don't even know if she can swaddle.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.690
Of course she can swaddle. I promise.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.318
Now, this service is top-notch.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.446
They got an A-plus
from the Better Business Bureau.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.740
Well, the BBB doesn't fool around.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.033
She's beautiful.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.119
Thank you!

10:19.202 --> 10:20.787
And don't worry. I'm a great swaddler.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.872
- Oh! We...
- Yeah.

10:23.456 --> 10:29.254
Okay. Claire, if your life were a movie,
what would the title be?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.173
Uh, I don't know, <i>Camera Shy?</i>

10:32.257 --> 10:35.218
Uh, can anyone say, "Lame"?
Put that thing down.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.221
Hey, babe, did you remember
to bring the box fan?

10:37.303 --> 10:40.682
- Those cabins get really hot.
- Uh, no, I thought you were bringing it.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.977
J.J., stop it!

10:57.115 --> 10:59.284
[gasps] There it is! Camp Firewood!

10:59.367 --> 11:01.161
Whoo-hoo!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.830
[Arty] <i>Good morning, everybody.</i>

11:03.913 --> 11:07.000
<i>Well, it's the last day of camp,
so once again,</i>

11:07.083 --> 11:09.419
it's time for all of you to grab
that one last kiss,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.546
last dance, last...

11:11.629 --> 11:13.882
[chuckles] Well, you know what I mean.

11:13.965 --> 11:18.219
There are certain things I can't say
on a family radio station, folks. [Laughs]

11:18.303 --> 11:19.387
Buzz!

11:20.179 --> 11:23.308
Ah, y'all just got stung
by your humble servant,

11:23.391 --> 11:24.726
the Beekeeper himself,

11:24.809 --> 11:28.104
manning the controls
for the tenth summer in a row.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.357
<i>And preparations are in full swing
for tonight's last blast,</i>

11:31.441 --> 11:34.611
<i>End of Summer Night's Dream Dance,
up in the barn.</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:37.822
But that's gonna be a night time thang.
[hooting]

11:37.906 --> 11:40.617
<i>Oh, and don't worry
if you see any old fogies</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:42.785
<i>wandering around the grounds today.</i>

11:42.869 --> 11:46.789
<i>The Firewood Class of 1981
has returned for their ten-year reunion.</i>

11:46.873 --> 11:50.376
<i>And McKinley, if you're listening,
I showered just last week.</i>

11:52.837 --> 11:57.759
- What's on your mind, Beth?
- Another summer come and gone, Nance.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.136
- Time sure flies.
- Yeah.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.222
Some years I feel
I've just barely kept it together.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.099
- [sighs]
- And ultimately I wonder,

12:05.183 --> 12:07.018
what is the point of it all?

12:07.101 --> 12:08.186
[car honks]

12:08.269 --> 12:11.606
- Beth! They're here! They're here!
- Oh! Oh!

12:11.689 --> 12:13.232
[all shouting]

12:13.316 --> 12:14.817
Claire! Oh!

12:14.901 --> 12:17.028
- [laughs] Hey!
- [car honks]

12:17.111 --> 12:20.156
Hey, I'm lost.
Does anyone know where Camp Firewood is?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.491
[all] Katie!

12:21.574 --> 12:23.284
It's so great!

12:23.368 --> 12:24.911
- Oh!
- Look at you!

12:24.994 --> 12:27.080
- My gosh! Oh, gosh.
- Oh!

12:27.163 --> 12:29.248
- Hey! Hi, Nance.
- Oh, Katie!

12:29.332 --> 12:31.209
Um, where's Coop? Is he coming?

12:31.292 --> 12:34.504
Of course. He's probably been
planning on this for the past ten years.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.799
- [Katie] Who is it?
- [Mark] Who's in the taxi?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.718
What's up, bitches? Let's rage!

12:40.802 --> 12:42.512
- [all] Susie!
- Yeah!

12:42.595 --> 12:45.014
- [Claire] Susie, you made it!
- Of course I made it!

12:45.098 --> 12:47.058
What, am I gonna miss my camp reunion?

12:47.141 --> 12:50.478
I told those New Line execs who wanted me
to stick around for a location shoot,

12:50.561 --> 12:52.480
"Screw that. I'm goin' back to my roots."

12:52.563 --> 12:53.606
- Ooh.
- That is true.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.235
She did actually say that. That's true.
I was standing right there. It was mental.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.319
[gasps]

12:58.403 --> 13:00.243
[whispers] Oh, my God.
That is Garth MacArthur.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.132
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>Espresso Compresso?</i>

13:02.156 --> 13:04.242
It is getting huge buzz at Telluride.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.868
- Garth MacArthur.
- Yes!

13:05.952 --> 13:07.495
- Uh, this is Garth, by the way.
- Hi.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.790
He's the lead actor in the film that I'm
producing slash co-executive producing.

13:10.873 --> 13:15.336
And take a really good look at his face
'cause he's gonna be a huge star one day.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.756
Stop it.
She's always buttering me up, aren't you?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.050
- Like a little crumpet or something.
- [both laugh]

13:21.134 --> 13:23.386
Garth, I would like to say
that any friend of Susie's

13:23.469 --> 13:25.179
is so very welcome here at Camp Firewood.

13:25.263 --> 13:29.475
So, does that include this ALF puppet
that I stole from the Warner Brothers lot?

13:29.559 --> 13:32.603
- [all exclaiming]
- [Mark] It's really ALF!

13:32.687 --> 13:37.275
[stammers] I'm a huge fan.
<i>Espresso Compresso</i> is amazing, obviously.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.611
- But I also loved <i>London Fog.</i>
- Oh, you saw that?

13:40.695 --> 13:45.366
Yeah, yeah. I'm a bit of a film buff.
I work at an alternative video store.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.536
Oh, nice one, man.
We should, uh, grab a pint later.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.830
Oh, my God! I would love that.
Black and Tan?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.123
[car honks]

13:52.206 --> 13:53.124
Whoo!

13:53.207 --> 13:55.001
[all] Victor!

13:56.002 --> 13:57.003
And Neil.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.005
- Hey, Neil.
- Hi, Neil.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.923
I brought a half a six pack!

14:04.260 --> 14:05.970
- Hi!
- [Nancy] The baby is here!

14:07.013 --> 14:09.057
- The baby is here!
- There she is!

14:09.140 --> 14:10.808
The baby is here!

14:11.309 --> 14:13.853
No, wait.
Nancy, you have not washed your hands yet.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.080
- Oh, come on.
- No, you have not.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.440
- Hey, everyone. This is our nanny, Renata.
- Hi.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.649
It's just for the weekend.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.693
Susie!

14:20.777 --> 14:21.986
[both laughing]

14:22.070 --> 14:25.740
- Oh, my God!
- You have a freaking baby!

14:25.823 --> 14:29.702
Hey, um, I don't know if you notice,
but I...

14:29.786 --> 14:30.786
I did.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.289
Did it fix your deviated septum?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.916
- It did.
- That's all that matters.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.794
- Oh, Sue.
- Aw. You look amazing.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.337
- Thanks.
- Even better than before.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.630
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.299
- Guys!
- [all] Abby!

14:45.134 --> 14:47.970
Neil, Neil! Check it out, check it out!

14:48.054 --> 14:52.725
Abby Bernstein's here,
and she's lookin' fly!

14:52.809 --> 14:54.519
- Wild.
- [chuckling]

14:59.190 --> 15:01.210
Oh, shit. Dude, she's coming over here.
How do I look?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.653
- You look great, you look great.
- Yeah?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.113
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No one better.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.366
- Hiya, Vic. How you doing?
- [chuckles nervously]

15:08.449 --> 15:10.076
You're still sportin' the perm, huh?

15:10.159 --> 15:14.497
It's all natural so... That's what it is.
It just comes out this way.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.790
That's great.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.836
[stammers] What is your job,
or whatever it is that you do?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.171
- I work for the <i>Downtown Press,</i>
- Uh-huh.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.732
And I write a sex and intimacy column,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.049
- Ah!
- Which is...

15:25.133 --> 15:26.843
It's a diary, kind of, really,

15:26.926 --> 15:29.679
- of my adventures with men and women.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.932
You know, whomever I meet.
[chuckles] I mean, you know.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.559
- Ah!
- You should check it out.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.144
There's some hot stuff.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.330
- [exhales sharply]
- How about you? What are you up to?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.231
[both laugh]

15:41.649 --> 15:44.735
I think... I'm gonna... I've been...
I work at a bar.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.364
That was good. I timed it.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.700
Hey, guys.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.536
[all] Gary Chester Silverson!

15:54.745 --> 15:55.788
[car honks]

15:55.872 --> 15:57.957
- There's Coop!
- [all exclaim]

15:58.833 --> 16:01.919
- Walla-walla-hoo!
- [all] Walla-walla-hey!

16:02.003 --> 16:05.381
- Kim-chu-ay!
- [all] Chu-ay!

16:05.465 --> 16:06.674
[all laugh]

16:08.092 --> 16:09.552
Hey, man! All right!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.596
- Coop!
- Oh!

16:12.513 --> 16:13.514
Hey, Katie.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.266
I've been thinking
a lot about you, Coop.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.310
I've been thinking a lot about you, too.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.978
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.104
Oh, wow.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.107
- [chuckles]
- This is gonna be a really fun weekend.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.402
Um...

16:27.778 --> 16:30.781
Yeah, I... I guess so.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.914
- [Victor] Whoo!
- [Beth] Okay, guys.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.958
Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody, everybody, everybody.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.252
Hand goes up, mouths go shut.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.171
[all boo]

16:45.254 --> 16:48.925
You may all be in your mid-20s,
but here at Firewood, you're campers.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.844
- Oh, come on, Beth. We're grown-ups now.
- [all murmuring]

16:51.928 --> 16:54.055
With social security cards and everything.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.473
Yeah. We drink wine.

16:55.556 --> 16:59.227
And I'm, like, getting
really into amber beers, like Schleinbach.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.621
I like to curl up with a good book.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.313
- Oh, yes.
- We all do, we all do.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.148
Me, too. I'm reading
<i>The Kitchen God's Wife </i> by Amy Tan

17:05.233 --> 17:06.400
and loving it.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.904
Well, this weekend, you're campers.
Sleeping assignments are as follows.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.548
Boys are in bunk eight. Girls, bunk six.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.258
- [sighs]
- And if I catch anybody sneaking out,

17:13.281 --> 17:14.575
you will miss group swim.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.243
- Come on!
- Just like old times.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.971
McKinley, I gave you and Ben
your own bunk,

17:17.994 --> 17:20.748
but only because you have a baby
and I know you need your privacy.

17:20.830 --> 17:21.707
[whispers] Thank you, Beth.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.669
We have an action-packed 24 hours
planned for you.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.463
Oh, yeah?
Beth, do you mean 24 hours, 3-6-9?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.881
- No, 65.
- 69?

17:28.965 --> 17:30.174
- Dirty dog.
- Right?

17:30.258 --> 17:32.927
[stammers] Like, when my wiener's
in her... like, near her face,

17:33.010 --> 17:37.306
and then her wiener or whatever that is,
is near my face?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.142
- It's a vagina.
- Vagina.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.066
And of course, the Shakespearean-inspired
barn dance later tonight.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.276
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

17:48.359 --> 17:51.529
- Walla-walla-hoo!
- [all] Walla-walla-hey!

17:51.612 --> 17:55.491
- Kim-chu-ay!
- [all] Chu-ay!

17:55.575 --> 17:56.635
[Beth] Okay, go get unpacked,

17:56.659 --> 18:00.371
'cause the first order of business
is chill time by the water.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.665
- Okay, here we go.
- You got this. You got this.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.749
- Yeah, buddy.
- Nice!

18:03.833 --> 18:06.043
Ah, rafter ball.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.504
- You're going down, Gar.
- Go for it, man.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.066
So, you and Claire
still aren't married, huh?

18:11.090 --> 18:14.719
Yeah, she doesn't believe
in societal institutions. It sucks.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.888
So I'm like, "Hey, if the cat's away,
the mice will play."

18:17.972 --> 18:20.367
- You know what I mean?
- [chuckles] I think I do, you dirty dog.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.226
[both] Ah-boom-boom-boom, hey-yah!

18:22.310 --> 18:23.310
[both chuckle]

18:24.562 --> 18:28.899
And so, anyway, I said to her,
"Sorry, Yasmine, but three is a crowd."

18:28.983 --> 18:31.652
- Yasmine Bleeth?
- I can't say.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.737
Obviously Bleeth.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.948
Susie, what you've done with your career
is just amazing.

18:36.032 --> 18:36.907
Thank you.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.552
And what's this thing
you're working on right now?

18:38.576 --> 18:41.537
And who is this debonair
British dreamboat?

18:41.621 --> 18:44.081
The film is called
<i>By the Grace of God and Ever After.</i>

18:44.165 --> 18:48.169
And it's being produced
slash executive produced by me.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.422
And Garth MacArthur is the lead
and also maybe an associate producer,

18:51.505 --> 18:53.341
depending on the work he does on set.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.104
And we're going out to Laura San Giacomo
for the role of the mother.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.512
- She's so...
- She's amazing.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.056
And she's become a very good friend.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.641
You're so creative.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.444
It takes such a risk to do
what you do, and just put it all out there

19:04.518 --> 19:05.996
and just create something out of nothing.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.855
A film is like a baby.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.750
And then you have it
and then it goes out into the world

19:09.774 --> 19:12.151
and everybody else gets to pass it around.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.234
- [Abby] Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.637
- It really is like having a baby.
- Yeah, yeah. I get that.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.657
No, no. It's very much like that.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.367
Yeah, no, I really get that.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.161
Having a film is like having a baby.
It's very, very much like that.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.289
- You have to deliver the film...
- Yeah, no, I really get that.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.459
It's such an interesting metaphor.
It's very much like having a baby.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.294
Oh.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.172
So, tell us about your makeup!
I wanna know, what are the colors?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.216
- I brought samples!
- [all screaming]

19:35.299 --> 19:36.676
[indistinct screaming]

19:36.759 --> 19:39.095
- Where? Where? Give it to me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.600
There's my girl. Yeah. There's my girl.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.227
- Can I hold her?
- Yeah.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.188
Yeah!

19:50.147 --> 19:51.399
Hey, wait a second.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.859
Don't worry about her. She's fine.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.282
McKinley, you have to calm down.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.619
Renata's great.
She really knows what she's doing. She's...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.746
Top-notch. I know, I know.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.248
And her agency got an...

20:07.331 --> 20:10.418
[both] A-plus rating
from the Better Business Bureau.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.879
[smack lips] They don't fool around.
That's why people trust them.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.464
I know, I know, I know.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.802
See, this is fantastic. We can have fun
and I can get some work done.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.556
Those blueprints are literally
kicking my ass.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.107
Ooh-la-la!

20:33.190 --> 20:34.525
[chuckles]

20:34.608 --> 20:37.236
I banged half of bunk seven
in this cot.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.946
Oh, wow, that was a crazy night.

20:39.029 --> 20:43.951
And since then I have been crazy
with the ladies every night of the week.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.371
Oh, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.500
Hey, did he forget hump day?
I think not! [Chuckling]

20:55.379 --> 20:56.380
Wow.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.007
He's still a virgin.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.426
Look at him.

21:00.509 --> 21:04.221
Oh, man, I took some good naps
on these camp beds back in the day.

21:05.473 --> 21:09.435
Wonder if they still got the magic touch,
if you know what I mean. [Chuckles]

21:09.518 --> 21:12.188
Hey, you guys, wake me up
in a couple hours.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.148
Oh, yeah!

21:15.024 --> 21:16.024
Whoo!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.903
Oh, my God, Katie, look!

21:18.986 --> 21:22.156
- [all] Oh!
- [Abby] Oh, my God, remember Andy?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.449
[all exclaim]

21:23.532 --> 21:26.869
Oh, you and Andy were such piping hot shit
back in the day.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.913
- [laughs]
- How's he doing?

21:28.996 --> 21:31.540
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
I haven't heard from him in years.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.059
Really? I thought you and Andy
would see each other

21:33.083 --> 21:35.711
and then you'd climb
into the wayback machine

21:35.795 --> 21:38.923
and just grind one out
for old times' sake!

21:39.006 --> 21:40.132
[all laughing]

21:41.300 --> 21:43.236
Wait, what's a wayback machine?
Is that a real thing?

21:43.260 --> 21:46.347
- No.
- You know, Andy was a girl's crush.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.516
I'm a woman now
and I have my eyes set on

21:48.599 --> 21:51.560
someone a little bit more sophisticated
this weekend.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.646
- [Claire gasps]
- Wait...

21:54.980 --> 21:57.233
- [all] Coop?
- [Katie] I know!

21:57.316 --> 21:59.860
I don't know what it is,
but I think I'm finally ready for him.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.989
And I think, judging from the brief
conversation that we just had,

22:04.073 --> 22:07.493
- he might be ready for me. So, we'll see!
- [all] Wow!

22:08.536 --> 22:11.580
Now, let's go back to unpacking. Okay.

22:16.377 --> 22:21.215
Oh, guys, I wanted to take a moment to say
that it's so great to have you all back.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.426
- The junior counselors from 1981.
- [laughs]

22:24.510 --> 22:27.137
- I've been here a lot of years, eh, Nance?
- Yeah. Right on.

22:27.221 --> 22:30.849
But something about that particular summer
was so very special to me.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.518
A lot happened that summer.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.853
President Reagan came
and killed our friend Eric.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.998
Our camp director
got turned into a can of vegetables.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.357
We went to town and shot heroin.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.692
Skylab fell on us.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.695
We almost played softball against
Camp Tigerclaw, but then didn't.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.739
Well, you know, it's like we always say,
"You can leave Camp Firewood,

22:45.823 --> 22:48.200
but the spirit of Camp Firewood..."

22:48.284 --> 22:50.452
- [all speaking indistinctly]
- "...never leaves you!"

22:50.536 --> 22:51.662
leave behind.

22:51.745 --> 22:55.708
Anyway, enough with the feelings.
Let's have some fun!

22:56.208 --> 23:00.254
<i>♪ Chums, chums, chums
On this we all agree ♪</i>

23:00.337 --> 23:03.966
- [grunts] Oh, God!
- Hey, watch your step there, Fred Astaire.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.175
Hey, that's not nice.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.429
Oh, I'm just kidding. I was having fun.
Nobody dances like Fred Astaire anymore.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.806
- [J.J.] Ugh! Tell me about it.
- [beeping]

23:24.737 --> 23:25.654
