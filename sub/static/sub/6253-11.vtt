Oh, yeah.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.664
Come on, Penny.
Show me what you got.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.168
That’s it.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.501
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, you sexy beast, you.

00:11.596 --> 00:14.133
Come on. Come on, Penny.
[ Grunting ]

00:14.223 --> 00:15.679
Find me those truffles.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.758
That’s it! That’s it!
Whoo!

00:18.853 --> 00:20.434
What? You got something?
Huh?

00:20.521 --> 00:23.137
Found some truffles there,
sweetheart? Huh?

00:23.232 --> 00:24.938
Let’s see what you got.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.529
Oh!

00:32.617 --> 00:34.323
Oh, you struck gold this time,
sweetheart.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.401
Hee, hee!

00:36.495 --> 00:38.656
Go on, find some more.
Find some more.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.997
Yeah?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.494
What you got? Huh?

00:44.462 --> 00:46.578
[Squeals]

00:47.173 --> 00:48.959
Oh, Lord.

[Gulps]

- [ Penny Squealing]

00:57.391 --> 01:00.053
Run, Penny!
Run!

01:11.322 --> 01:14.405
| just don’t understand why
we just didn’t hire that fourth
sitter that we interviewed.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.153
She was like Mary Poppins,
Bones.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.618
She didn’t know the difference
between Montessori and Waldorf
educational theory.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.411
Lookin’ for new day care?

01:21.499 --> 01:23.706
We believe the one-on-one attention
Christine will receive from a nanny...

01:23.793 --> 01:26.409
is preferable to the dynamics
of a group environment.

01:26.504 --> 01:29.041
Christine was expelled
by the Jeffersonian day care.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.632
Suspended.
I’m appealing the decision.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.832
How does a baby
getsuspended
from day care?

01:32.927 --> 01:36.135
I don’t know.
It might have somethin’
to do with her mom...

01:36.222 --> 01:39.214
questioning everything
that the staff
and the directors do.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.173
Because you care so much
about our daughter.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.183
Oh.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.477
Why did you say “oh”
like that?

01:44.563 --> 01:46.690
I didn’t. ljust said it
like “oh.”

01:46.774 --> 01:49.811
They felt that Bones was
turning the other parents
against the staff.

01:49.902 --> 01:52.279
No, we all agreed the multicultural,
multilingual song time...

01:52.363 --> 01:53.853
is not too much to ask.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.563
- Oh.
- You did it again.

01:55.658 --> 01:57.194
- I don’t think I did.
- Didn’t he?

01:57.285 --> 01:59.401
Bones,no.
We’ve gone through
two nanny services,

01:59.495 --> 02:01.611
four child-care providers,

02:01.706 --> 02:04.664
three Ph.D. candidates
from American University—

02:04.750 --> 02:06.957
because you care
so much about our daughter.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.877
- Who’s watching Christine now?
- A medical student.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.875
But today’s her last day.
I don’t know why she’s leaving.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.922
- [Chuckles] Really?
- [Cell Phone Rings]

02:14.010 --> 02:16.126
If you don’t make a decision
by the end of the day,
I’m gonna hire someone.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.429
- Booth.
- Is it possible your inability
to find adequate child care...

02:20.516 --> 02:23.724
is because you’re
feeling anxious about
separating from Christine?

02:23.853 --> 02:26.310
That’s absurd.
Great. Okay.
On our way.

02:26.397 --> 02:29.855
Okay. Gotta go.
We have a case
in West Virginia.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.479
You can’t make a decision
like this on your own, Booth.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.694
What? You don’t trust me now?
I’m not a good enough dad?
Yes, but—

02:35.781 --> 02:38.363
No more interviewing.
It’s starting to feel
like Charlie Rose.

02:38.451 --> 02:40.191
Right? You have to admit.
Okay, come on.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.697
We are really out
in the sticks, aren’t we?
Yeah.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.494
[ Pig Squeals]
Whoa, what was that?

02:47.585 --> 02:50.668
Oh, the man who found
the remains was out here
with a truffle hog.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.666
It ran off
when it saw the remains.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.463
Truffles?
There’s truffles out here?

02:54.550 --> 02:56.506
All right,
just relax there, bug boy.

02:56.594 --> 03:01.304
Let’s finish the investigation,
and you can dig for all
the truffles that you... want.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.097
Oh, wow. Talk about
dead guy standing.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.348
Yeah, his overall strap
got caught on this branch.

03:07.438 --> 03:11.181
The large projecting
mastoid process, broad chin
and high nasal root...

03:11.275 --> 03:13.607
indicate the decedent
was a Caucasian male.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.606
I heard that they were cultivating
Tuber me/anosporums in Rixeyville,

03:16.697 --> 03:19.109
but I had no idea that
the spores had made it
this far south.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.862
- What’s he talkin’ about?
What are you talkin’ about?
- The truffles.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.694
Listen. The pig’s owner
said the skull had eyes
that glowed red.

03:24.789 --> 03:28.373
Ask me,
I think this guy was
just tanked on moonshine.

03:28.459 --> 03:31.576
Nope.
It is because of these guys.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.203
What’s that?
Coleoptera: Phengodidae—

03:34.298 --> 03:37.005
also known as railroad worms.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.381
See, the females, right?
They glow green to
attract the males...

03:40.471 --> 03:42.257
and red
to frighten off predators.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.554
That’s exciting.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.677
Judging by the porosity
of the exposed ulna,

03:45.768 --> 03:48.555
the decedent was
approximately 80 years old.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.012
Oh, well,
maybe he just got hung up
on the branches there.

03:51.107 --> 03:53.564
He couldn’t unhook himself,
and he just died of
natural causes.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.108
The high volume of dried blood
on the victim’s clothing...

03:56.195 --> 04:00.438
indicates that he bled out
from penetrating trauma to
one of the major blood vessels.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.364
That would indicate assault.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.692
All right! Let’s get it back
to the Jeffersonian then.

04:04.787 --> 04:07.824
Let’s cut down
Grandpa Walton here and—

04:10.084 --> 04:11.369
Bones,
what are you doin’?

04:11.460 --> 04:14.202
I do trust you.
| just want you to know that.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.797
You’re an excellent father.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.918
Right. But this is
a professional setting,
Bones.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.718
Not for me.
There’s nothing more I can do
until I get back to the lab.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.011
Oh.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.339
[ Man Chattering]

04:26.434 --> 04:30.302
Mmm. Wow.
What was that one for?

04:30.396 --> 04:34.139
I enjoyed the previous one
so much, I wanted one more.
I’m done now.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.892
I’m not done.
Bones?

04:37.987 --> 04:40.194
Bones?

05:12.605 --> 05:15.062
Ms. Wick, I’m going to need
the clothes removed...

05:15.149 --> 05:16.935
and the bones cleaned
as soon as possible.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.891
[ Daisy]
Dr. Hodgins was gonna
swab the overalls.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.942
[ Brennan ]
There’s no reason
for the shoes to be on.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.988
- He clearly wasn’t shot
MhSEQ.
- Of course.

05:24.074 --> 05:24.859
I’m gonna
need an age...

05:24.950 --> 05:25.735
for the facial
reconstruction.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.362
80 years old.
40 years old.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.529
I hate to disagree with you,
Dr. Brennan,

05:31.624 --> 05:35.333
but, based on the robusticity
of the muscle attachments,
he was closer to 40.

05:35.419 --> 05:39.003
The porosity of the bones
indicates a male closer to 80.
It’s in my field report.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.954
You are misreading
the musculature.

05:41.050 --> 05:44.463
I’ve been reading musculature
and tissue anomalies
for 16 years.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.589
So the misreading
of the evidence is yours.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.760
- He’s 40.
- He’s 80.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.299
[Chuckles] I hate it
when Mom and Mom fight.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.975
I’m sure once you settle
your babysitting issues,

05:54.063 --> 05:55.553
you’ll be a lot less cranky.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.269
Why are the decedent’s shoes
still on?

05:59.360 --> 06:03.023
I’m gonna test the striated
muscles to show the elasticity
of the myosin myofibrils.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.523
That should give us
a definitive age.

06:04.615 --> 06:07.823
I will carbon-date the bones,
which will be even more accurate.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.821
[ Daisy]
He’s a polydactyl.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.527
[Angela ]
Will that tell us
how old he is?

06:11.622 --> 06:13.362
It just means that
he has six toes.

06:13.457 --> 06:17.325
It’s a congenital anomaly
common in Egyptian nobles
and heritage chickens.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.671
Well, since he’s neither
royalty nor a chicken,

06:19.755 --> 06:22.997
getting an ID.
and a correct age
should be a piece of cake.

06:27.179 --> 06:30.842
- [ Cooing ]
- She is adorable.
I have missed this so much.

06:30.933 --> 06:34.346
- She likes you.
- What’s not to like? She
doesn’t know I have a record.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.892
You think Tempe’s
gonna be okay with this?

06:35.980 --> 06:39.347
She’s gonna be fine with it.
You’re the grandfather.
Family, Max.

06:39.441 --> 06:44.902
Okay, I got the diapers,
the wipes and, um,
the batteries for the moni—

06:44.989 --> 06:46.820
- Dad!
- Hey, baby.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.614
Uh, boy, she’s getting big.
[ Chuckles ]

06:49.702 --> 06:50.817
Max here is gonna help out
with Christine,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.617
till, you know,
we can find someone...

06:52.705 --> 06:55.071
or she’s allowed back
into day care.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.780
You should’ve told me,
Booth.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.331
I’m telling you now, right?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.080
We don’t have anyone,
and look at that.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.749
She loves him.
[Sniffs]
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.377
I think that, uh, we have
just made a deposit here...

07:05.467 --> 07:06.752
in the diaper bank.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.586
- Oh, H can change her.
- No, allow me, please.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.337
Sure.
Be back in a jiffy.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.969
- Here.
- I got it.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.475
What? You said you trusted me.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.929
That’s the man
who abandoned me
as a child, Booth.

07:20.024 --> 07:22.811
But he risked his life, you know,
to come back into yours.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.143
Look, he loves her.
You can’t get that, no matter
how much you pay, Bones.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.022
[Cell Phone Rings]
Right? Booth.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.736
Hold on, hold on.
Great.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.738
Okay, just text me
the rest of the information.

07:33.829 --> 07:34.909
- [ Beeps ]
- What was that?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.908
Got the ID. from
one of the local hospitals.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.832
The sixth toe was a giveaway—
Tug Babcock, 65.

07:39.918 --> 07:43.376
No, that’s not possible.
The bones indicated that
he was at least 80.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.965
Okay, well, what?
You were 15 years off,
and Cam was 25 years off, right?

07:48.052 --> 07:50.168
If I were you,
I would just hang my hat
on margin of error.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.674
[Christine Cooing ]

07:53.724 --> 07:55.260
There she is.
There she is.

07:55.351 --> 07:59.344
She’s just like you.
You were exactly like this,
happy all the time.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.144
[Christine Laughing]

08:01.231 --> 08:03.187
It’s perfect!

08:04.360 --> 08:07.102
[Cooing]
Oh, man.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.782
It appears the victim
was shot on the left side.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.606
At a range of less than 15 feet,

08:12.701 --> 08:14.783
based on the powder burns
on his clothes.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.452
The bullet traversed
through the body
from left to right,

08:17.539 --> 08:20.201
nicking the L4
before hitting the pelvis.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.499
You’re saying that because
he was shot at such close range,

08:22.586 --> 08:24.247
it shattered the right half
of the pelvis?

08:24.338 --> 08:26.203
Yes. I did a great job,
didn’t I?

08:26.298 --> 08:27.879
And, by the way,

08:27.966 --> 08:32.426
I’m so sorry both you
and Dr. Brennan were wrong
about the victim’s age.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.344
I know that caused
a lot of tension.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.013
But you chose to bring it up
anyway.

08:37.101 --> 08:41.094
When will you have the rest
of the pelvis reconstructed,
Ms. Wick?

08:42.481 --> 08:43.891
It’s in a million pieces.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.018
And we already know
that he was shot.

08:46.110 --> 08:49.944
You wouldn’t wanna
miss anything, would you,
and wind up like me?

08:52.032 --> 08:55.900
Oh, no. I mean,
you’re wonderful, brilliant.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.610
- Did you find the bullet?
- No, ma’am.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.946
It’s probably still
at the crime scene.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.496
We’re gonna need it
if we’re gonna find that weapon.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.710
- I’ll send some techs out.
- I’m available.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.285
So is Angela. We’ll go.
It’s no problem.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.419
Let me know when you finish
that reconstruction, Ms. Wick.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.471
[Chickens Clucking ]

09:22.563 --> 09:24.269
We found him in the woods
off Rural Route 6.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.096
We just thought Daddy
was out campin’.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.307
Sometimes he’d be gone
for days and...

09:28.402 --> 09:31.064
then come back...
with a bunch of dead things.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.066
Mama’s a supermarket girl.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.899

she come back here
after law school,

09:38.787 --> 09:40.652
she lost her appreciation
for fresh-killed meat.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.700
It’s not the meat.
Oh.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.375

when l was in the city.

now that he’s gone.

Well, I’m, uh,
very sorry for your loss.

won a property lawsuit
against the Mobleys.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.153
is that girl who’s
always walkin’ through
those woods at night.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.731
Who? What girl?

20:42.826 --> 20:45.317
Beats me.
All I know is that she
took a shot at me one time.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.614
I had to run for my life.
And you didn’t report her?

20:47.705 --> 20:50.538
l was trespassing, okay?
What else do you
want from me?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.081
There’s no need
for hostility.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.420
Unless
you’re masking something
you don’t want me to know.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.870
Look.
I’m telling you everything.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.796
I don’t know who she was.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.875
Just some blonde,
maybe 20 or so.
It was dark.

21:01.970 --> 21:06.589
But I did see her
take off, though,
in an old blue pickup.

21:06.683 --> 21:11.222
It had a rusted hood,
only one taillight.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.571
Excellent.
Thanks.

21:20.655 --> 21:24.022
[Angela ]
Hodgins and I found the casing
as well as the bullet.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.073
But they don’t match
the old man’s gun.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.652
They could belong
to the mystery woman
in the woods.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.951
You really
do excellent work.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.872
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you, Daisy.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.168
Wait a minute.
What’s this?

21:38.256 --> 21:40.212
- Can you enlarge this image?
- Yeah.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.042
[Angela ]
Oh, that’s just
white powder on the bullet.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.719
lt— There’s some trace
in the casing too.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.718
There are tiny fragments.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.141
This is bone.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.093
Bone?

21:54.189 --> 21:56.100
But— Huh.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.772
But what?

21:58.860 --> 22:02.853
These bone fragments
from the bullet should
match the victim’s bones.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.733
Of course.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.359
But look.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.990
The colors don’t match.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.117
The bone on the bullet
is a different color—
a different porosity.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.699
Wait.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.000
That’s bone
from another person?

22:18.087 --> 22:21.705
I think we might
have two victims.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.837
[ Booth ] Two victims?
[ Brennan ]
That’s what it appears.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.923
The bone matter that
Ms. Wick found...

22:31.017 --> 22:32.848
was definitely
not from Tug Babcock.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.722
So we’re lookin’
for another body.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.975
I will look for
environmental markers
when I examine the bone.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.978
It could potentially
give us the location
for the other remains.

22:41.069 --> 22:42.605
[Line Ringing]
My father’s
not answering.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.606
Oh, he probablyjust
put Christine to bed.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.688
No, she should be up
from her nap already.

22:46.783 --> 22:49.149
Anyhow, listen.
I talked to local PD.
in West Virginia...

22:49.244 --> 22:51.735
about helping us search
for that blue pickup truck.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.036
They’re not too happy
about getting involved.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.784
Well, it’s murder.
They don’t have a choice.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.117
I think the cops
are actually glad that
they’re killing each other off.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.748
I think they’ve had it
with this feud.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.088
You’re calling again.
Yes. And I called
five times before that.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.457
Bones.
Why isn’t he picking up?

23:05.552 --> 23:06.917
Well, there could be
millions of reasons.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.385
That’s right. And not
all of them are good.
Bones.

23:09.472 --> 23:13.215
This is a man who walked out
on me and my brother...
without warning.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.470
Just left.
You think I didn’t try
calling then too?

23:15.603 --> 23:18.310
It’s different.
Is it?
Why is it?

23:18.398 --> 23:22.232
I told him I’d be calling.
I told him to keep
his phone close.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.229
What-What if
he just left again?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.653
He wouldn’t do that, okay?
He’s probably out for a walk
with her.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.319
Don’t patronize me, Booth.
I told him I’d call.
[Cell Phone Rings]

23:30.410 --> 23:31.900
Okay. Wait.
Hold on for a second.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.326
Booth.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.449
Great. Okay, listen.
They found a blue pickup truck.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.781
I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.
I got a buddy at the DC. police.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.459
I’ll give him a call.
I’ll ask him to look
for Max, okay?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.912
Okay. Thank you.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.669
And I’ll go home
and wait for them
in case they come back.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.296
H can do the preliminary work
on my bone fragments there.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.844
Call me when you find ’em.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.843
Danny, it’s Booth.
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor. Will you?

23:57.145 --> 23:59.181
[ Sweets ]
So you put that
whole pelvis back together?

23:59.272 --> 24:01.513
That must’ve been, like,
a million pieces.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.395
Yes. Pretty amazing, right?
Oh, and look what I found.

24:04.485 --> 24:08.319
You see this little hole
on the superior iliac crest?

24:08.406 --> 24:11.398
Two millimeters.
That size matches
a biopsy needle.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.905
And since there’s minimal
remodeling, it must’ve occurred
within days of his murder.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.156
So you think he was sick.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.034
I’m having Dr. Saroyan
run tests for me on the marrow.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.116
You’re having me
run tests for you?

24:21.210 --> 24:25.954
Oh, hi. No, I meant
you’re running tests,

24:26.049 --> 24:29.416
even though you
wouldn’t have a reason to
if I hadn’t found the hole.

24:29.510 --> 24:33.674
Which you wouldn’t have found
had I not insisted that you
reassemble the pelvis.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.848
Hey, there’s no sense
in fighting. I mean,
this isn’t a competition.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.799
Oh, that’s where you’re wrong,
Dr. Sweets.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.385
It is, and I’ve won.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.893
l have the results
from the marrow test.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.187
Osteogenic chondrosarcoma.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.234
Tug Babcock
had bone cancer?

24:49.322 --> 24:52.064
Stage 4
and widely metastatic.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.069
He had maybe a month to live.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.027
He was shot
with only weeks left?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.736
That’s so sad.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.948
I’m gonna tell Booth
and Dr. Brennan.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.749
This Mobley-Babcock feud
killed an old man...

25:06.839 --> 25:09.046
who just wanted
to live out a few more days.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.168
It’s crazy.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.920
Yeah, well, given
their long history...

25:12.011 --> 25:15.048
and the dynamics of a complex
interpersonal relationship—

25:15.139 --> 25:17.630
It has to end, Lance.
Look at this.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.349
Each one is a different version
of how the feud started.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.934
“Carlene was a witch who gave
Stonewall a potion that turned
his liver into worms.”

25:29.028 --> 25:31.735
“Stonewall poisoned Carlene
because his dinner was cold.”

25:31.823 --> 25:33.313
There are 50 of these.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.694
l have to find the truth.

25:35.785 --> 25:39.369
I can use the bones,
environmental factors,
historical records.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.616
- Don’t you have
other work to do?
- Lancelot.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.997
This is about bringing peace
and restoring trust
in human goodness.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.952
Don’t you think
that’s important work?

25:48.798 --> 25:50.754
Of course.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.753
Hmm.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.050
l was looking
through the bone dust,

25:58.141 --> 26:01.508
and I found a few particles
that have enough mass
to examine.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.103
[ Hodgins ]
80, What am / loo/ring for?

26:03.187 --> 26:05.394
[Brennan ]
There appears to be
tunneling in the bone.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.346
That could indicate
insect activity.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.683
Hey, this could’ve been
caused by mites.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.190
I usually only see
tunneling like this
at archaeological sites.

26:13.281 --> 26:16.489
Could the mites have left
any environmental markers?

26:16.576 --> 26:19.659
I mean, they could.
They frequently shed
their outer shells.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.204
Okay. / Will
get these samples back to you
as soon as possible.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.247
You can send them
for carbon dating...

26:25.334 --> 26:27.199
so that we can determine
when the victim died.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.785
[ Doorbell Rings]

26:28.880 --> 26:31.667
l have to go, Hodgins.
Thank you.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.552
Hello, Dr. Brennan.
Uh, Seeley wanted us to
bring him here personally.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.016
- Thank you.
- Hey, I got it, pal.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.591
I’m-I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry.

26:43.686 --> 26:47.019
My cell phone must’ve
fallen out of my jacket when
we were playing in the park.

26:47.148 --> 26:50.811
Give me Christine, please.
Oh, she— Please.
I said I was sorry.

26:50.902 --> 26:54.486
You disappeared just like before.
I had no way to get in touch.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.278
But she’s fine.
She’s more than fine.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.981
I can’t go through this again.
I can’t have another day like this.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.486
You won’t.

27:02.205 --> 27:05.413
l have to call Booth
to let him know
that Christine is back.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.032
You should leave.
Ah, listen,
please, honey.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.460
Please leave, Dad.

Okay. I love you too.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.801
You give Christine
a kiss for me. Bye-bye.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.928
I really
gotta get chained up
to listen to that?

27:25.019 --> 27:26.805
I’m sorry. You might wanna be
a little bit nicer, okay?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.386
You’re a murder suspect,
SueBob.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.309
I haven’t killed no one.
Really?

27:30.399 --> 27:33.812
Because we know that
you were taking potshots out
in the woods the other night.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.643
Maybe you were aiming
at Tug Babcock?

27:35.738 --> 27:38.275
I fired a few warnin’ shots.
That’s all.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.152
There are bears
in those woods.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.029
But I checked.
I didn’t hit no one.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.077
Okay, so I’m supposed to believe
that you were shooting at bears.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.572
You’re gonna have
to do better than that.
I don’t have to say nothin’.

27:47.667 --> 27:51.706
Fine. l’m takin’ you in.
All right, boys. Take her in.

27:51.796 --> 27:55.084

That’s what I was doin’
in the woods.

[Murmurs]

27:59.428 --> 28:00.929
Junior Babcock.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.505
Let me get this straight.
You were going to see
a Babcock?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.807
Junior and me—

28:09.021 --> 28:12.855
I love him, okay.
And he loves me.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.274
We couldn’tjust come out
with something like that.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.226
Tug would’ve started a war
if he found out.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.321
Maybe Junior killed Tug.
No way.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.525
Junior would’ve killed himself
before he would’ve
hurt his grandpa.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.655
I swear.
He dropped from heaven,
that boy.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.711
Seems like
you’re a regular at
the sheriff’s department.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.254
Isn’t that right, Junior?

28:37.341 --> 28:40.925
Look at this— burglary,
arson, vandalism,
barn burning.

28:43.014 --> 28:44.550
One’s a misdemeanor,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.222
and,uh,
the other’s a felony.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.517
Right. You sure are
a lawyer’s son,
aren’t you?

28:49.604 --> 28:52.437
Where is this leading, Agent Booth?
All those charges were dismissed.

28:52.523 --> 28:55.481
Right. You kept,
uh, clogging up
the county courts.

28:55.568 --> 28:59.231
As long as l have to live
in that backward hellhole,

28:59.322 --> 29:01.938
I will use my legal training
to reduce the violence...

29:02.033 --> 29:03.739
and move this dispute
to the courts.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.282
Now you’re acting
like that’s a crime.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.736
No. But murder, that’s a crime.
And it’s not a misdemeanor.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.947
No, I love my granddaddy.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.499
I’d never hurt him.
Grandpa taught me to shoot.

29:13.586 --> 29:17.170
It’s probably
not the best thing
to admit right now, Junior.

29:17.256 --> 29:21.124
So, you and SueBob,
you met in the woods
that night, didn’t you?

29:21.218 --> 29:22.924
How’d you know about that?

29:23.012 --> 29:25.344
You met SueBob Mobley?

29:26.599 --> 29:29.306
Why in the hell
would you do that?

29:29.393 --> 29:31.258
Probably because the two
of them, they were,

29:31.354 --> 29:33.845
you know, gettin’ it on,
right, Junior?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.100
Oh.

I’m sorry, Mama.

I wanna marry her.

29:40.071 --> 29:41.732

29:41.822 --> 29:44.029
You know the rain of hurt
you’d be bringing down
on your family?

29:44.116 --> 29:46.607
Yeah, and grandpa,
he wouldn’t have been
too happy about that either.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.609
What, you two
get into a fight?
No!

29:48.704 --> 29:50.820
- We’re done here.
- And you ended up
killing him in self-defense?

29:50.915 --> 29:54.578
- Don’t you answer that.
- You got it wrong.
Grandpa gave me his blessin’.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.118
His blessing?

29:57.213 --> 29:59.670
He said he was sick
of all the fighting.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.839
He was happy
for me and SueBob.

30:01.926 --> 30:06.044
SueBob doesn’t know it yet,
but he-he gave me money
for a ring.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.675
A ring?

30:12.019 --> 30:13.975

It’s common
to reevaluate your life
when it’s about to end.

So he wanted the feud to end
so that the kids could be happy.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.549
This is remarkable.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.378
The bone’s
120 years old?

30:48.472 --> 30:50.053
How is that
even possible?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.219
Because there was
no second victim that night.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.017
The bone dust was packed
into the ammunition.

30:56.105 --> 30:59.893
Why would someone put
a dead person’s bones
inside a bullet?

30:59.984 --> 31:02.691
It’s a custom
in certain societies,

31:02.778 --> 31:05.030
especially American
rural communities.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.854
It’s a way of honoring
their ancestors,

31:06.949 --> 31:09.986
much like some tribes
which construct their homes...

31:10.077 --> 31:12.159
out of the remains
of their relatives.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.487
I mean, if someone
made these bullets,

31:14.582 --> 31:16.743
we should be able to
find out who bought them.

31:22.506 --> 31:25.418
[Daisy] I’m thinking that
the whole feud started
from the wrong premise.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.500
The poisoning
makes no sense.

to get married first?

tearing each other apart

to repair the damage,

in the past 120 years?

of a challenge for you.

are in the old bones,

the soil and water tables.

out from under this case, Cher?
Yeah, yeah.

32:55.558 --> 32:58.049
The bullet that
killed Babcock, it was
purchased by Mobley.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.677
How can you be sure about that?
We found the gun shop
that made the bullets.

his great-great-great-
grandfather’s ashes.

All right, well,
Norbert ordered 30 rounds
of Stonewall Mobley ammo.

33:11.949 --> 33:15.533
So you can match the bullet
you found to the batch
that was made for Norbert?

in the house, yeah.

That’s great.
You were gonna poison us.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.301
It’s probably because
of the copper vein.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.852
I mean,
it was mined at the end
of the 19th century.

33:43.939 --> 33:48.854
The acid rock drainage probably
contaminated the water table
with toxic runoff.

33:48.944 --> 33:52.186
If your truffle is toxic
years after the area was mined,

33:52.281 --> 33:55.114
it must’ve been deadly
in the 18003.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.613
Wait. Why do we care
about the 18003?

to stop the lawsuits.

The tree where Tug was found,
that was where Stonewall
and Carlene’s cabin was,

39:41.588 --> 39:43.670

in the stream was toxic.

from the copper mine would’ve
contaminated their stream.

and died from acute
