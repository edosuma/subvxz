Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:04.300 --> 00:08.200
Is it Andy? It's him?

00:08.200 --> 00:10.200
Yeah, Andy.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.900
Don't do this to yourself, man.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.800
You gotta help me, Bobby.
I want these guys dead.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.700
Look, I don't think
this guy in there did it.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.500
- What did he say?
- He locks himself onto a robbery charge...

00:23.500 --> 00:26.300
- on a story that's really easy to check.
- So we're no place.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.400
Whiskey. Line 'em up.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.400
- Hi.
- Have a good walk?

01:33.100 --> 01:35.900
It's okay.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.500
- Look to tire myself out.
- This has gotta stop.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.300
Andy...

01:48.300 --> 01:50.800
you are drinking!

01:51.900 --> 01:54.400
- What are you talking about?
- Don't insult me.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.400
These late night walks. You won't even
get near me 'cause of some chest cold?

01:58.200 --> 02:01.900
- You want me to get the both of you sick?
- I have given you your time.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.600
And if you don't want to talk
to me about AndyJr., okay.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.699
- I will not stand here while you lie to my face.
- I'm not Iying!

02:12.400 --> 02:16.100
If I have a few drinks,
trying to deal with things...

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I walk till I'm sober-
I make sure I'm sober coming home.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.900
You are not sober
when you come home!

02:21.800 --> 02:25.000
And having a few drinks
isn't not drinking.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.900
I'm sober at home, at work.
I meet my responsibilities.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.400
You're not meeting
your responsibilities!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.500
Andy. God. Get out!

02:35.700 --> 02:39.100
- What?
- Put some stuff in a suitcase and get out until...

02:39.100 --> 02:43.200
you are not not drinking" or
you are not not Iying" to me.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.800
I don't want you here if you can't even
acknowledge the problem.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.300
I acknowledge some things.
Didn't I just acknowledge a few drinks?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.900
All the baby's
gonna hear me do is cry.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.100
You're telling lies inside of lies
and you are slapping me in the face.

02:57.100 --> 03:00.200
I have never laid a hand on you.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.000
Great. You want me out of here,
Sylvia, I'm gone.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Just let me get a suitcase.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.400
- You mind if I touch the baby?
- Yes!

03:12.700 --> 03:15.100
No, go ahead.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.400
I'm meeting my responsibilities.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.400
15th Squad. Ah, no, no.
She's no longer with us.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.400
- Yeah. Can I help you?
- I'm looking for the lieutenant.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.100
I wrote the name,
but I can't read it.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.000
- I'm Lieutenant Fancy.
- That's it!

04:57.900 --> 05:00.800
I'm Lucy Kinley from
the Borough. I'm your new P.A.A.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.900
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Fancy. Is that West Indian?

05:04.800 --> 05:07.400
You look just like somebody
I know from Guyana-Bissau."

05:07.400 --> 05:11.000
Uh, no. There's your desk.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.500
Oh! So I can see
everyone coming in.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.500
Yeah. You'll meet the squad
as the day goes on.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.000
Uh, you should also be aware, there was
a tragedy last week involving one of our men...

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
Detective Sipowicz.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
His son was murdered
while intervening in a holdup.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.700
Okay.

05:26.700 --> 05:30.200
Take a minute to settle.
Then I'd like to get you started.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.400
Are you familiar with the monthly stats
that come into the Borough?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.300
No. I don't know how to do those.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.000
Okay. Okay. A little later
I'll show you how.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.400
For now, type out our roll call.
I scratched it out for you there.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.200
And then fax it to the Borough
when you're through.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.500
- No problem. Thank you, Detective.
- Lieutenant... Fancy.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.100
- Last time. I promise.
- Okay.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.700
- Good morning.
- Hi.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.400
Hi. I'm Bobby Simone.
This is Diane Russell.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.800
I'm Lucy Kinley. I'm you're new P.A.A.
How you doing?

06:00.800 --> 06:04.500
I'll do better with a P.A.A.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.600
I been at the Borough for the last year.
I'm gonna do the roll call now.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.800
Then Lieutenant Fancy's gonna teach me
how to do the monthly stats later in the day.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.700
That's great.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.700
- Hey, good morning, Andy.
- How's it going?

06:23.700 --> 06:26.600
Feel like today's the day?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.700
We're getting same pattern
parole releases from Connecticut...

06:30.600 --> 06:33.800
New Jersey and Pennsylvania
about 9:30.

06:33.800 --> 06:38.300
Boy, I'll tell you.
All these leaps forward, progress...

06:38.100 --> 06:41.300
Sons of bitches that killed him
gotta be shaking in their boots.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.700
Andy, we've run every skell on
the Lower East Side through this house.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.700
We're gonna keep on doing it
until we turn these guys up.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.700
I'd like to meet the asshole
that made these things.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.300
You through in here,
or you want to look for clues?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.100
Okay. A woman was treated
last night at an E. R...

07:16.100 --> 07:17.900
for a knife wound she said
was accidental.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.900
Now she wants to press charges
on her boyfriend for attempted murder.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.200
- She's coming up?
- Yeah. She's on her way upstairs.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.800
- Angela Bohi's her name.
- Yeah, I'm Angela Bohi.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.700
I'm Detective Russell, Angela.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.700
I got stabbed above the elbow.
Attempted murder.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.100
- I'm up.
- I can take it, Andy.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.000
The interview needs a woman's touch?

07:32.900 --> 07:35.900
- She got sexually assaulted in the elbow?
- Why don't you work it with me?

07:35.900 --> 07:38.400
Why don't we all talk
in the coffee room?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.500
Why don't you have a seat?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.300
The guy who stabbed me's named
Bobby Kupchak.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.800
- It's a miracle I'm even alive.
- What's your relationship with him?

07:54.700 --> 07:58.400
Well, he's a violentjerk
I'm sick of even trying to deal with.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.800
You could pick him up at Shea Stadium.
He's got a big job there selling beer.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.600
- Slow down, Miss Bohi.
Does Bobby Kupchak live with you?

08:03.600 --> 08:07.600
- Sort of, yeah.
- What led up to him stabbing you?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.300
Okay. See, what led up to it was
we had a fight...

08:10.200 --> 08:12.200
he took a knife,
and he tried to murder me.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.300
Hey, we're here to help you, Angela.
So let's lose the attitude.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.200
He smacked my kid.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.400
Which he got no business even touching
him, let alone raising a hand in anger.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.700
- What's your boy's name?
- Timothy.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.600
This asshole smacks him
in the back of the head...

08:30.600 --> 08:32.900
Timothy told you that Bobby hit him?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
He hit him yesterday morning.
I found out last night.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.200
And last night was
when Bobby stabbed you?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.100
Okay.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.200
I brought home a chocolate cake, right,
because, you know, I like cake.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.500
Anyway, I was slicing it when Timmy says he's
afraid of being home alone with Bobby mornings.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.200
And when I ask him why, he tells me
Bobby hit him for dropping his lunch box...

08:50.200 --> 08:52.300
running out
to make the school bus.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.900
In comes Mr. Asshole. I send Timmy
to his room and ask Bobby where...

08:55.900 --> 08:59.100
he gets balls big enough to hit
on a kid ain't even his own blood...

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
in a place he don't pay
50 cents rent?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.700
So I'm holding up the knife,
the butcher knife, to defend myself and...

09:05.600 --> 09:09.500
Hey, asshole!

09:09.500 --> 09:13.100
- Cut it out, Angela.
- Am I boring you? Because I almost died!

09:12.900 --> 09:15.600
- What? You threw a soda can at me?
- Yeah, that's what I did.

09:15.500 --> 09:19.900
- You threw a soda can at me? - Andy!
Leave the room. - You gonna hit me?

09:19.800 --> 09:21.900
- You never been hit like I'll hit you!
- Andy!

09:22.000 --> 09:24.300
- What's your name?
- You never been...

09:24.300 --> 09:26.200
Andy, get the hell out of here!

09:35.600 --> 09:38.700
Throws a soda can at me.
Cigarette ashes...

09:38.700 --> 09:44.400
All right. Thanks.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.200
These Newark cops,
they think it's worth the interview.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.600
I'm gonna go talk to these guys
that did the same pattern stickup.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.200
You think I should tell Andy
maybe you got something?

09:52.200 --> 09:56.400
Maybe you should hold off on that, James.
You know, spare yourself the abuse.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
- You're sure it's okay?
- What are you? A nurse or a detective?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.400
- How's that?
- It's fine. Fine.

10:04.300 --> 10:09.600
Angela, that detective
had a personal tragedy.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.000
I'm sorry it's made this
more difficult for you.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.100
He snores in my face, and then
he says he's gonna hit me?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.800
- I'm really sorry that happened.
- You think I'm gonna sit still for that?

10:16.700 --> 10:20.400
- Maybe his boss should know.
- That's not gonna help with the problem you came here to solve.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.800
I also want you to know I'm gonna
give this case number-one priority.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.000
Let me know where I can pick up Bobby
Kupchak, and we're gonna go after him.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.800
Didn't I say
he works at Shea Stadium?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.100
- I was talking about the daytime, Angela.
- And I'm telling you...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.200
it's a day game today.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.300
All right. We're gonna
go after him right away.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.400
I'll be in touch with you
with any developments.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.500
- Your phone number's here on the 61, right?
- Yeah, right.

10:41.500 --> 10:46.600
Okay, Angela. Uh-Why don't we go
to the stairs this other way?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.900
Detective Sipovich?"
I'm Lucy. I'm your new P.A.A.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.000
- That's great.
- That's okay. I understand.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.100
There's a priest here to see you.
Mr. 'Kanak-areedy?"

10:59.100 --> 11:02.100
- Andrew.
- Sylvia sent you down here?

11:02.100 --> 11:04.000
I'd like to speak somewhere privately.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.300
This is, uh, my workplace.
I work here.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.100
I had hoped we could talk.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.900
Let's go to an interview room.
That's like our confessional, huh?

11:15.900 --> 11:18.300
People confess the sins they did.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.800
- My deepest sympathies on the death of your son.
- Thanks.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.100
To answer your question,
Sylvia's very concerned.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.400
But it was I who suggested that
I would like to speak with you.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.700
You should be talking to her.
She's who you should take care of.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.100
Andrew, before you
and Sylvia got married...

11:47.100 --> 11:49.500
when you and I spoke
at our counseling session...

11:49.500 --> 11:51.900
I felt that you were
a soul in struggle.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.700
I got no interest
in what you got to say.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.800
I know you're in pain of what's happened,
and you're angry, but...

11:59.800 --> 12:03.700
Why in the hell should I pay
attention to you, huh?

12:03.600 --> 12:09.500
You believe in God? Where was God
when my boy got killed in that bar?

12:09.400 --> 12:12.100
- He was there.
- Then he can kiss my ass.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.600
How could he stand there
and that boy die?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.000
We're not made to understand
God's purposes, Andrew.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.300
Was he trying to punish me?
All right, I deserve punishment.

12:20.300 --> 12:26.000
But what about my first wife?
She did nothing but keep care of him...

12:25.800 --> 12:27.900
and take abuse from me!

12:28.000 --> 12:30.300
And what about him, huh?
He tried to help someone.

12:30.300 --> 12:36.000
He got his whole life in front of him.
And he was as sweet as ever was born.

12:35.800 --> 12:40.800
Don't you tell me that I did
something so bad to do that to them!

12:45.900 --> 12:48.700
God is not in the punishment business.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.200
And you're not
in the center of the world.

12:51.100 --> 12:56.600
Your son's death is not part of
some equation. It's a mystery.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.700
Yeah. Well, my job is
working on the mystery part.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
Sylvia tells me you're involved
in a 12-step program.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.200
Oh, I'm one of their
big success stories.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.700
Try to accept again
the third step of your program.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.500
Turn your life over to God.
Be its witness and part of its process.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
You never had a son.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.400
- God had a son.
- Well, I'm not God.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.800
And I want you to go.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.300
God is with you, Andrew.
Try to feel his love.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.700
The Borough said there's something
wrong with the roll call you faxed them.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.400
- You got that list that I wrote out for you?
- Right away.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.200
- Excuse me. Lieu.
- Yeah?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.500
I'm gonna go pick up this
stabbing victim's boyfriend.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.200
- Um, I need someone for backup.
- Andy's not available?

14:06.200 --> 14:11.300
- No. He's busy.
- So what was that shouting about before?

14:11.200 --> 14:14.300
In the coffee room?
Complainant got a little excited.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.700
You know, she was excited, high-strung.
She tossed a soda can at Andy.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.400
It's all squared away now.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.000
So what's Andy doing now that
he's unavailable for backup?

14:20.900 --> 14:24.100
He's, uh- He's working
another aspect of the case.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
All right. Take Greg.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.200
Can I take somebody from Anticrime?
I hate to take anyone off AndyJ.'s task force.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.600
Take Greg.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.500
I, uh, I need you to help me
with this pickup.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.300
Uh-huh. Um, I-I got...

14:40.300 --> 14:42.900
- I'll be done in a few seconds.
- Okay. Let me know.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.300
- Yeah.
- Great.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.400
I have to clear decks.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.300
- Let's talk, Andy.
- Of course.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.000
Let's go into my office.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.900
What would be our topic?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.700
I, uh... want you
to take some sick days.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.700
No.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.700
Take some days, Andy.
Go home.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.300
Russell's pissed off? My attention wandered?
Can't say it to my face?

15:26.300 --> 15:30.500
She wants the interview, what? I'm supposed
to stand there the whole time at attention?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.900
All Diane said about the interview
was the woman was high-strung.

15:33.900 --> 15:38.100
Yeah, well. What's the point if you're trash
and you can't act like it, huh?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.600
As much as I feel for
what happened to your boy...

15:40.500 --> 15:42.500
you make it so I can't look
the other way.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.400
You're ruining morale. Everyone in the squad's
covering for you, pulling your weight for you.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.200
Tell them to cut it out. I do my job.
Give me something to do.

15:50.200 --> 15:55.100
Diane wouldn't say so, but she's afraid to
go on the street with you. And she's right.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.200
That's her problem. That's her job.
Don't be afraid to go out on the street.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.700
My kid's dead!

16:03.900 --> 16:06.900
Andy, go home.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.700
This is what you've
been waiting for, huh?

16:12.600 --> 16:15.800
This is the day you've been
waiting for, isn't it, pal?

16:15.800 --> 16:21.000
If I was looking to do you in, I'd take your
gun right now and send you to the farm.

16:20.900 --> 16:25.100
But I'm giving you a last chance to fix this
yourself, because I respect you doing it before.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.700
But the next time I see you, you're sober
and ready to work, or you're through.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.000
Brotherhood's got a meeting today? You be up
for a big award at the Brotherhood meeting?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.500
- Get out of here.
- They know about it, huh? We got Sipowicz?"

16:35.300 --> 16:37.400
- Shut your mouth!
- We got Sipowicz!

16:37.400 --> 16:40.900
Shut your mouth!

16:40.800 --> 16:44.900
You're embarrassing the job. And you're
embarrassing your son's memory.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.200
Please... go.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.800
- May I help you?
- Gone for the day, minimum.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.200
- All right, Detective.
- I need to talk to a detective.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.900
- Hey, what's up?
- He sent me home.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.200
Wait, wait.
How far did it go?

17:24.200 --> 17:28.700
We were gonna fight. Then we just agreed,
no cards on Martin Luther King Day.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.200
- Go home, Andy.
- Are you gonna give me a hard time too?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.800
What's your big feast day?
I won't send you no card either.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.800
Excuse me, Detective. I think maybe
you should know this right away.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.200
This woman says she knows something about
the men you're looking for in this big case.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.200
Why don't you put an ad in the Post?

17:50.100 --> 17:53.000
- You looking to talk to a detective?
- Mm-hmm.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.600
- On that case with the big reward?
- It's about these guys.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.600
Okay, come on.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.700
- What's your name?
- Deena Farnham.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.300
It's right in here.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Have a seat.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.500
What do you got for us, Deena?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.700
That one's name is Ray.
And he's Mitch.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.300
- Ray and Mitch, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.200
I mean, I knew they were
dirt-ball type guys.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.600
But I never thought, like, killers.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.400
I mean, this Andrew SipowiczJr.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.300
- You're a working girl. You did these guys?
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.300 --> 18:32.300
So the day that kid got killed, that night
they're stoned, and they're partying with me.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.700
- Where's this?
- The Mohawk. I mean, they were stoned.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.200
Like on speed and liquor.
Then later, like the next day...

18:40.200 --> 18:42.400
I'm back at my own place,
and I see on the TV...

18:42.400 --> 18:46.400
about this young guy getting killed
trying to stop a holdup.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.600
And now I'm remembering
these guys.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.900
All messed up and loaded, saying how
they messed up some guy in a bar.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.400
I mean, the guy tried to be a hero,
and they really messed him up.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.700
So now, a whole week goes by.
And these fliers, they're all around...

19:00.500 --> 19:04.300
with the sketches of these guys
from the bar waitress's description.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.800
And I know you've seen it on TV too,
with this big reward number.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.800
- Wh-What is it now?
- 65,000.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.300
65,000 there.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.500
And you don't reach out. And now...

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
- Here you are.
- I don't care about the money.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.000
I mean, I care. Yeah, I'd take it.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.600
But I'd have left it sit too.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.600
Except they paged me last night.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.900
- And now I'm scared they're gonna kill me.
- Why?

19:28.900 --> 19:31.800
Off suspecting what I know.
That's what I figure.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.900
And they figure,
just as well kill me.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.800
Deena, why don't you think that
they're just calling you to party again?

19:36.800 --> 19:40.400
I just didn't get that feeling
from their voices.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.500
Where'd they call you from?

19:42.500 --> 19:45.100
I don't know.
They said a pay phone.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.200
So we're about 85% here, right, Deena?

19:48.300 --> 19:51.600
- What do you mean?
- And you know, ordinarily, I would settle.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.300
I'd figure 85% for pretty good.

19:55.300 --> 20:00.600
Andrew SipowiczJr., this kid-
this is a cop's son.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.900
This is a kid who tried
to save a woman's life.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.900
No. You bring it all, Deena.
Or you're gonna be taking a beating.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.600
If I knew something...

20:16.600 --> 20:22.500
and didn't say it till now,
what does that mean about jail?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.900
Help us now, Deena.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.200
The only way we would jam you up
is if you killed him yourself.

20:32.500 --> 20:37.000
They left the Mohawk before me.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.900
And it must've took a week...

20:39.900 --> 20:44.400
remembering that they had lost it
or maybe that they'd ever even had it.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.800
But...

20:49.500 --> 20:51.600
They asked about it last night.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.000
And...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.500
that's how I know
they're gonna kill me.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.900
That's a Hackensack shield.

21:09.900 --> 21:13.900
I'm supposed to meet them
at Fourth and'D"at 200 to give it back.

21:31.900 --> 21:36.300
- Forty minutes late.
- She says they're late coming to party too.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.400
- I'm afraid I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.500
This is Morrisey.
Two white males just walked past our unit...

21:41.400 --> 21:43.900
same side of the street,
headed toward the restaurant.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.200
They fit her description.
Look like our guys.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.200
- Is that them?
- Yeah. Oh, my God.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.300
- Are you sure that's them?
- I'm positive.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.500
- All right, get down.
- What's going on, man?

21:53.500 --> 21:55.400
Come on.
Move your ass. Hey!

21:55.400 --> 22:00.800
I got someplace to be or I'd kick your ass
good for you, you slant-eyed piece of crap.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.600
- I'm coming out on foot
about 115 feet behind them.

22:03.600 --> 22:08.600
- What, are they beating up that guy? You got it?
- Stay here with her, James.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
You want to go?
I'll kick your ass good for you.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.000
- I'll kick your ass.
- Yo, yo, cop!

22:27.300 --> 22:30.200
Police!

23:44.500 --> 23:47.000
17 East Third Street.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.000
Hey.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.400
- Great job, Bobby.
- Thanks, boss.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.500
Yeah. Every witness makes it a good shoot.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.600
So I'm excused from Lefrak City?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.200
No. No, you gotta see the shrink.
Get your gun to Ballistics.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.300
- I know Andy went home.
- I sent him home.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.600
I thought maybe I'd go tell Sylvia.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.100
Okay, go ahead.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.700
You want someone to
drive you to Lefrak?

24:21.700 --> 24:24.800
- No. I'm good.
- All right.

24:26.900 --> 24:31.200
It's, uh, important to let him know.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.100
I will.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.300
Detective, the whole time...

24:43.200 --> 24:46.500
I was in the lavatory,
I forgot it was unisex.

24:46.500 --> 24:50.100
I sat there the whole time
without the door locked.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.500
Hi.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.300
Sylvia, the, uh, the guys
who murdered AndyJ. Are dead.

25:14.600 --> 25:18.700
- Does Andy know?
- We don't know where Andy is.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.300
I see.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.100
Bobby wanted to tell you, but
after something like this...

25:25.000 --> 25:28.400
they make you go to Lefrak City
to see the Department doctors.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.800
It was Bobby who got 'em?

25:31.800 --> 25:35.700
Uh, we were set up to take them. They drew
down, and Bobby had to shoot them both.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.700
- He's all right?
- Yeah.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.800
Bastards.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.500
I'm glad they're dead.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.200
How are you and Theo?

25:48.100 --> 25:50.500
You know Andy's out of the house.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.000
I can't have him here drinking.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.500
L- I agree with you.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.900
I just hope that this
will help him turn the corner.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.300
Uh, it's up to him.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.900
I want to help him.
But I know I can't.

26:11.900 --> 26:15.400
You're doing... what you have to, Sylvia...

26:15.300 --> 26:17.600
looking out for yourself and Theo.

26:19.900 --> 26:23.000
But I-I think you're right.
You know, these guys goin' down...

26:22.900 --> 26:25.400
can be Andy's excuse
for the day to stay drunk.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.900
But if he wants to,
he'll turn the corner.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.800
I hope he does.

26:35.100 --> 26:38.000
- I know.
- Shh!

26:40.600 --> 26:44.000
We take you now, live to the scene.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.700
A shoot-out on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan today...

26:46.600 --> 26:48.700
Brought an end to the week-long manhunt...

26:48.600 --> 26:51.800
You want to pace it a little?
I'm not going anywhere.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.500
- Son of one of their own, Andy Sipowicz-
- Two things you got to say to me:

26:54.400 --> 26:56.500
86"and closing time."

26:56.400 --> 27:00.200
Why don't you try and keep
a civil tongue in your head, okay?

27:00.200 --> 27:04.200
A robbery and sexual assault in a bar
in the 15th Precinct of Manhattan...

27:04.100 --> 27:07.100
where his father has served
as a detective for 14 years.

27:07.100 --> 27:11.700
Today, the young man's assailants lost
their lives after initiating a gunfight...

27:11.600 --> 27:15.100
in the street with precinct detectives
who were closing in for an arrest.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.100
Now back to you in the studio.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.700
Uh, I'm just checkin'
to say and confirm...

27:34.700 --> 27:37.900
two skells were involved
in a homicide.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.000
And they've been taken
down this afternoon?

27:40.000 --> 27:45.500
Uh, that's all been established?
Correct perps and so forth?

27:49.200 --> 27:52.700
What does it matter to you
who's calling? Father Christmas.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.200
Um, has anybody...

27:57.100 --> 28:01.400
The cops involved know from
anyone there was appreciation?

28:02.400 --> 28:06.600
Well, let them know that
there was appreciation.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.000
Never mind who.
Rabbi Wolf.

28:19.900 --> 28:23.200
- Bootsy Collins,
Larry Graham, Brothers Johnson.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.700
- Look at the look on his face.
Don't even have a clue too.

28:25.700 --> 28:29.100
Calls himself a bass player.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.700
- Who you listening to supposed to be so funky?
- RickJames.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.300
- Oh, Rick James!
- What?

28:34.300 --> 28:39.300
I'm gonna have to kick your ass.
I thought the lecture was gonna do it.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.300
- Excuse you?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to move it along.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.700
- Why we gotta move it along?
- I want this corner clear.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.600
- We ain't even doing nothing.
- I want you off this corner.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.500
My son and I were
looking at this corner.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.200
Look, buddy.
I can smell the liquor on your breath.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.800
So why don't you go pick on
somebody else, huh?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.800
- What's your name, mouth?
- Knowledge.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.100
- Supposed to be funny?
- Drunk-ass cop, you the funny one.

29:01.900 --> 29:05.100
Why don't you go buy what you was
gonna buy so you can get even drunker?

29:05.100 --> 29:09.600
- We ain't moving.
- I don't say something I'm not prepared to say.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.300
You don't move,
I'm gonna move you.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.900
- Let's go, y'all. It ain't even worth it.
- Hold up. Hold up.

29:18.200 --> 29:22.700
Move me. Come on, devil.
Move my black ass.

29:22.500 --> 29:26.700
You don't think I'm gonna move you?
I'm gonna show him what you do and don't.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.700
Show me.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.500
Yeah! How you like it?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.500
How you like it, huh?
How you like it?

29:43.600 --> 29:46.300
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Just stay away.
- No, sir.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.500
- I'm okay, son. Stay away.
- You're not okay.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.600
You okay now?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.200
- Hey, who's that?
- Where your gun at, pig?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.700
- I got it.
- Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

30:12.000 --> 30:17.400
Call a radio car. I'm a cop.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.900
- How is he?
- One of the nurses is talking about broken ribs.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.800
But I don't know
what else is going on.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.700
- Job go over the air?
- No. Off the books so far.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.600
Hey, Bobby.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.600
Those guys got his gun.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.600
- Detective.
- Doc, what's going on?

30:49.600 --> 30:52.600
Well, neurologically he's intact.
He's got two broken ribs.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.300
- We fitted him for a belt to protect them.
- Bobby.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.000
Yeah, Andy.
I'm right over here.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.200
Look, Doc, if Andy's name gets on
the books for this, he's jammed.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.400
I put my college dean's name
on the admitting form.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.900
- Tell Mr. Kramer I hope he feels better.
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.000
Hey, Bobby, I got a good idea on
the mutts that did this.

31:09.900 --> 31:13.100
- Me and my partner are gonna go and try and snatch them up.
- Hang on until I get Andy set up.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.100
- And then I'll go looking with you.
- All right.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
How's it going?

31:26.100 --> 31:28.000
Thanks for getting those guys.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.700
Either of them say
anything about Andy?

31:34.600 --> 31:37.000
It was a gunfight in the middle of the street.
Nobody said nothing.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.800
You gave Shannon a pretty
good description, huh?

31:41.800 --> 31:44.300
He thinks we can find
these guys who beat you.

31:46.900 --> 31:50.600
They got my gun.

31:50.400 --> 31:55.400
I'm finished.
I've made a mess of everything.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.900
You wouldn't let nobody
help you, Andy.

31:58.900 --> 32:02.000
It threw me for a loop.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
I felt the kid
was gonna be happy.

32:05.900 --> 32:10.200
I could help him after
I never did nothing for him.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.600
He got killed.
And you started drinking.

32:12.500 --> 32:17.100
And you left Sylvia alone. And the baby.
Just like you did AndyJ.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.900
So what are you gonna
do about that now?

32:25.500 --> 32:27.800
I don't know what to do.

32:29.300 --> 32:33.900
Do you want people to help you, Andy?

32:37.500 --> 32:41.400
Please help me. Yeah.

32:45.800 --> 32:49.800
Hey, there's Greg.
Can you walk?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.800
Yeah.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.400
- Hey, Andy.
- Thanks for showing up.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.000
Yeah. You need a chair?

32:57.100 --> 32:59.400
No. I can- I can walk.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.300
I want to get you back over to the house
and help Shannon look for these guys.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.700
Now, if we got lucky,
and you can make an I.D....

33:06.700 --> 33:08.800
And we can get that gun back
before the boss came in...

33:11.100 --> 33:13.300
I don't know how else we're
gonna save your job, Andy.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.800
Let's go.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.900
You better not cost me my job.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.900
If we're wrong, we'll get it
straight with your boss.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.200
- How long you been working at the A&P?
- Four years in June.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.700
I figured I'd been seeing you that long.
Got promoted, huh?

33:40.500 --> 33:43.200
- Restock clerk to produce.
- Hey, Knowledge...

33:46.300 --> 33:48.700
What lie you got going?
What you saying I did?

33:48.700 --> 33:51.400
He'll talk to you.
Wait'll the detective gets back.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.600
Find any of those guys?

34:00.500 --> 34:05.800
Andy. Andy.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.800
Hey. Andy.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.100
Is this guy right?

34:11.000 --> 34:16.500
Drink this.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.500
I lost my glasses.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.400
Th-They're right here.
Right in your coat, Andy.

34:34.900 --> 34:39.600
Is he right?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.900
He was one of them.
He was the mouth.

34:43.699 --> 34:47.900
- I'm gonna go talk to this guy.
- Andy, stay right where you are.

34:55.699 --> 34:58.200
Tough leaving things
in other people's hands.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.400
Yeah.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.400
You want me to take
those glasses, Andy?

35:06.400 --> 35:08.400
Yes, please.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.700
Hey, boss.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.500
What's going on?

35:29.700 --> 35:31.700
Andy got beat up
last night out on the street.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.800
- How bad?
- Couple ofbusted ribs.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.600
Who's in there?

35:39.500 --> 35:41.800
The mutt in the pokey's one of
the three guys who stomped him.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.400
- Andy I.D.'d him off the photo.
- Andy I.D.'d him off the photo?

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
- Wh-Where's Andy?
- Upstairs in Medavoy's crib.

35:48.300 --> 35:52.300
- Why?
- Diane says Sylvia threw him out.

35:53.900 --> 35:56.700
Lieu...

35:56.700 --> 36:00.100
They stole his gun,
the guys who stomped him.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.500
- Does the one in there know where the gun is?
- I think probably he does.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.600
- What's his name?
- Knowledge Islam.

36:11.600 --> 36:16.400
- That's my boss.
- What's this about?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.300
Assault on a cop, theft of his weapon.
Cop picked you out.

36:20.300 --> 36:23.300
Crazy, drunk-assed police.
He never showed us his badge.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.400
- We figured he was some drunk white guy looking for a fight.
- You done?

36:27.300 --> 36:30.700
I took his gun in self-defense.
Were we supposed to run...

36:30.600 --> 36:33.800
and trust him not to shoot us in the back
after he instigates the whole damn thing?

36:33.700 --> 36:35.800
You done now?

36:39.200 --> 36:42.700
I'm gonna make this simple.
You're looking at five years in jail.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.300
You take us to his gun,
you walk away.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.100
Oh, damn! Do I look that stupid?

36:48.000 --> 36:51.100
I take you to that gun, you kick my ass
about four hours...

36:51.100 --> 36:54.400
- and then lock me up anyway.
- We lock you up, you go to trial.

36:54.300 --> 36:58.200
You think we want it out in court a cop's
drunk, looking for a fight, loses his gun?

36:58.100 --> 37:01.500
So maybe I take you to the gun,
you dump me in the river.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.800
- You know where your mother's at?
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:05.700 --> 37:09.700
You, me and your mother. Three of us
go for the gun; you walk home with her.

37:13.100 --> 37:18.400
Okay. All right.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.200
We'll go with my aunt.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.800
I don't care if he's got a job. An R.O.R.
Release won't discourage this guy much...

37:35.800 --> 37:37.800
from beating up
this woman or her kid.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.100
Can't you make it 20,000? We halfway
owe this woman. There was, um...

37:43.100 --> 37:45.300
a little excitement between
her and one of our detectives.

37:46.700 --> 37:49.100
Appreciate it.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.600
That's the woman, Andy was
sawing wood during her interview?

37:51.600 --> 37:53.900
Yeah.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.900
Hey, boss, how'd you do?

37:55.900 --> 37:59.200
- I got it.
- So, now what?

37:59.100 --> 38:04.400
Now I'm gonna wash my hands.
And then I want to talk to Andy.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.500
This is yours.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.200
Do I get it back?

38:39.900 --> 38:43.100
Think about something, Andy.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.800
You come back to work
and you're still drinkin'...

38:45.800 --> 38:48.600
something like last night's
gonna happen again.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.200
Or maybe you'll wind up dead.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.200
Then Sylvia won't have a husband,
your baby won't have a father...

38:56.100 --> 38:58.400
and some guys'll spend the rest
of their lives in jail...

38:58.400 --> 39:00.700
for something that
didn't have to be.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.200
What's left for you
on this job, Andy?

39:14.700 --> 39:20.100
I could do good for people
if I could stop drinking.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.000
The key for me is
not to drink no more.

39:25.900 --> 39:29.600
- Can you stop?
- I want to stop.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.900
I realize now he's gone.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.900
You bent over backwards
to keep me on the job.

39:42.700 --> 39:48.500
And I had a wrong mouth
and everything else.

39:48.300 --> 39:52.300
Please, don't take my job.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.900
Let me take some days,
come back and try.

39:57.400 --> 40:02.300
All right. Right now your work's
at home anyway, isn't it?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.900
Don't make me sorry.

40:23.600 --> 40:28.500
I won't, boss. Thanks.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.500
I'm taking the next set off to get
myself together and be with Sylvia.

40:56.400 --> 41:01.000
- That's good.
- Would you let the squad know my appreciation?

41:00.900 --> 41:04.500
- Yeah.
- What everyone did, and...

41:04.500 --> 41:06.900
with me being such a sport.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.000
And you especially.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.600
I know what you did for me.

41:16.600 --> 41:21.500
Andy, out on the street there,
those were good shootings.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.400
What you did otherwise.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.200
I gave you nowhere to go.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.800
You're still set up with me.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.700
So you want a ride?

41:51.700 --> 41:53.900
I asked Shannon.

41:53.900 --> 41:58.000
On the ride, I can ask him
to thank the uniform cops.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.700
Could you give Sylvia a call?
Let her know I'm gonna look pretty bad.

42:11.800 --> 42:16.700
- Anything else?
- I gotta do the rest.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Hi, Andy.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.500
Fourteen hours since I drank.

43:06.400 --> 43:10.300
I apologize for what I done.

43:10.300 --> 43:14.800
I love you and the baby.
If you take me back...

43:21.100 --> 43:26.300
We love you, Andy.
And we want you back.
