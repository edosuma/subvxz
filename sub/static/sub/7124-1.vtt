(dance music plays, indistinct conversations)
Denise, we have concluded

00:36.368 --> 00:40.839
you're an interesting and conventionally
hot woman. My siblings and I would like to

00:40.906 --> 00:46.578
request a date with you. Are you available
for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on

00:46.679 --> 00:52.886
Friday, Grob on Thursday, or Gob on
Sunday? Please select your dates now.

00:55.154 --> 01:01.993
- Aaaah-oooooh! That's nice.
- Eat it, Lich.

01:02.061 --> 01:09.634
- Eat it, Lich.
- Whooo! (chomping)

01:09.701 --> 01:13.838
What?! No more crackers!
Eeeeeee!

01:14.006 --> 01:18.876
- Prismo! Prismo!
Hey, man, hey! - Hey.

01:18.944 --> 01:23.648
- Bad news... You ran out of
cheese crackers. - What?! No.

01:23.715 --> 01:29.053
- Yeah, man. What are you gonna
do about it? - Jake. (chuckles)

01:29.121 --> 01:35.493
I'm Prismo the wishmaster. We can
have all the cheesy crackers we want.

01:35.561 --> 01:42.399
(laughs) (chomping)
Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.735
- Oh, stop!
- I'm always smiling when

01:44.803 --> 01:47.605
I'm around you. I just
noticed that. I always am.

01:47.673 --> 01:51.108
I'm always smiling when I'm
around you, too. (giggles)

01:51.176 --> 01:54.879
- This feels so good.
- Peppermint butler! Death!

01:54.946 --> 01:59.650
- What's up? - Hey, um, those
guys are doing selfies on the Lich.

01:59.718 --> 02:04.187
- Is that safe? (chuckles)
- Definitely gonna send these to Denise.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.624
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
He's harmless.

02:06.725 --> 02:10.661
Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone
in the room right now... Controlling our

02:10.762 --> 02:14.832
minds, making us rip each other's eyes
out while we buttercup one another?

02:14.933 --> 02:20.771
Well, the Lich's primary function is to cause
mass death, and since he can't do that while

02:20.839 --> 02:28.079
he's trapped in my time room, he's stuck in a
standstill, like a machine without a purpose.

02:28.146 --> 02:31.182
- I'm so scared right now.
- Yikes! - Ah, don't worry.

02:31.249 --> 02:38.856
He ain't gonna hurt nobody. Ha! You got
a cup on your head. Haha! You dingus!

02:38.924 --> 02:45.229
(laughs) - See, he's docile
as a lamb. - Hmm. Well, okay.

02:45.297 --> 02:48.866
- Then I guess I can go for a selfie,
too. - Yeah, man, make your

02:48.934 --> 02:54.505
dreams come true. (both
laugh) Oh! What time is it?

02:54.573 --> 03:00.211
- Hey, yo, clockface! What
time is it? - It's 12:30.

03:00.312 --> 03:05.015
Ah, boo to that. Yo, Prismo, I got to
get back before Finn realizes I'm not

03:05.083 --> 03:07.852
home. He gets worried
if I stay out too long.

03:07.919 --> 03:10.154
- All right. Later, dude.
- Laters!

03:18.296 --> 03:23.901
- Jake, where were you?
- I was, uh, in the... All right, man.

03:24.002 --> 03:29.874
I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing
a lot of partying at Prismo's lately.

03:29.941 --> 03:34.812
- Come on, man! I don't even take lady
up there. - Dude... I found out my

03:34.880 --> 03:39.750
- human dad is still alive. - Whoa!
What? - He's at some place

03:39.818 --> 03:45.790
- called the Citadel. - Whoa!
Are... are you gonna go see him?

03:45.891 --> 03:49.994
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't.
Maybe there's a good reason he

03:50.095 --> 03:54.732
didn't raise me, like he was probably captured
by thieves and kept a slave for years.

03:54.833 --> 03:59.170
Yeah. Or maybe he was ambushed in
the wild and hid you so you wouldn't

03:59.237 --> 04:03.007
- be captured, too. - Yeah.
Maybe it's better not to rock

04:03.074 --> 04:07.244
- the boat. - But it might also
be good to find out if you got any

04:07.312 --> 04:11.582
genetic risk factors or allergies or
whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll

04:11.650 --> 04:15.219
look like as an old guy. Could
be cool. (chuckles lightly)

04:15.287 --> 04:18.889
I guess it would be okay to meet
him, just to know what I'll look like.

04:18.957 --> 04:24.662
Cool. Oh! If we hurry,
Prismo might still be partying.

04:31.002 --> 04:36.207
- Come on! Just one more game. - I don't
know, Mang. I was just gonna, like, clean up

04:36.274 --> 04:41.679
- and crash out.
- Aw, yeah! More play-ahs! (groans)

04:41.746 --> 04:45.282
- You guys want to play
some card wars? - No.

04:45.350 --> 04:48.853
- Prismo, we need to get
to the Citadel. - Whoa!

04:48.954 --> 04:54.792
You guys do not want to go
there... Seriously. Check this out.

04:54.860 --> 04:59.663
The Citadel is a nastisized prison.
Only the worst of the worst end

04:59.731 --> 05:07.738
up there. Real stinkfaces.
These guys are the pits...

05:07.806 --> 05:11.909
- The armpits. - Hey, my dad
must be, like, the warden there.

05:11.977 --> 05:17.548
I know you can't grant me and Finn any more
wishes, so we brought Shelby along to wish

05:17.616 --> 05:21.051
- on our behalf. - Hello.
- Ha! Look at that... A little

05:21.119 --> 05:25.723
- guy. - So... I wish for...
A pony for my G.F.!

05:25.790 --> 05:28.158
- Done. - Shelby!
- Sorry, dudes.

05:28.226 --> 05:32.730
My girl's been hounding me for a pony
for months. I'm gonna mad points for this.

05:32.797 --> 05:38.802
(cellphone rings)
Oh, hi! Oh, so you got it?

05:38.904 --> 05:43.073
That's great. You like him? Uh-huh.
You're gonna name him what?

05:43.141 --> 05:46.777
- Speedboat? Yeah, that's
a good one. - Dang, Shelby.

05:46.845 --> 05:51.181
A wish wouldn't have worked anyway.
You can only get to the Citadel

05:51.283 --> 05:56.554
- committing a cosmic crime. - So, what do
we got to do... Rob a cosmic bank or steal

05:56.621 --> 05:59.723
- a space baby? - Hoo! Uh,
I just remembered I got to

05:59.791 --> 06:04.662
go home. Got to groom my
feathers. Goodbye. Goodbye!

06:04.763 --> 06:10.467
Listen, if you guys are serious about this,
all you got to do is find a certain sleeping

06:10.535 --> 06:15.573
- old man and bring him here.
- That's it? - Yep, he's on one of those

06:15.640 --> 06:18.876
floating islands out there. It kind
of looks like an upside-down duck.

06:18.977 --> 06:22.646
- That doesn't seem like much of a crime.
- Yeah, but that's all there is

06:22.714 --> 06:25.449
- to it... For now.
- What? - Check it out.

06:25.550 --> 06:30.688
- I got gifts for you guys.
- Heh! Cool. It's a pen light.

06:30.755 --> 06:34.191
Bazoo! Zoooo! Vroom! Jake, don't
look directly in the... Aaaaah!

06:34.292 --> 06:38.195
(energy buzzing) - Oh! Oh,
sorry. - Pa-choo! Pa-choo!

06:38.263 --> 06:40.898
- Pew! Pew! - Pa-choo!
Pa-choo! - Pew! Pew!

06:40.966 --> 06:45.069
(clears throat) Come on, Finn.
Let's go find this old guy.

06:45.136 --> 06:50.741
Oh, one last thing, dudes.
Whatever you do, don't wake him up.

06:50.809 --> 06:52.509
Okay, you can go now.

06:57.716 --> 07:04.722
Pew! Pew! You ever wonder what happened
to make a place all wrecked up like

07:04.789 --> 07:08.959
- this? - Nope.
Hey, upside-down duck!

07:09.027 --> 07:13.831
No, wait, it's right side up.
Ah-ha!

07:19.070 --> 07:24.808
- Hey! Get out here, old man!
- Dude, shh! Don't wake him up.

07:24.876 --> 07:29.513
Hey, get out here, old man.

07:32.117 --> 07:37.021
Bazow! Old man.
(mutters)

07:37.088 --> 07:43.227
Beep. Beep. Beep.
(groans) (hissing)

07:43.294 --> 07:49.600
Uh-oh! Finn, a little help.
(hissing continues)

07:49.668 --> 07:54.705
Bazap!
(glass shatters) (groans)

07:54.773 --> 07:59.043
(hissing) Hmm. Kazow!
(glass shatters, energy)

07:59.110 --> 08:07.651
(buzzes) Let's hoof it!
(grumbling)

08:07.719 --> 08:16.193
Jake, don't jostle the package.
(all hissing)

08:16.261 --> 08:18.996
Hut! (glass shatters)
All right.

08:19.097 --> 08:28.305
- Oh! (all hissing)
- There's too many of

08:28.373 --> 08:38.182
- them! - Let's see
here. (energy hums)

08:38.249 --> 08:44.121
(steam sizzles) - Oh, hey! You're
back. - Dude's got serious

08:44.188 --> 08:52.029
- night terrors. - What now,
Prismo? - Okay. Wake him up.

08:52.130 --> 08:56.366
- What?! - Yeah. I just
wanted one last look at

08:56.434 --> 08:59.636
- myself. - Wait,
this old man is you?

08:59.704 --> 09:04.007
That's right. Prismo is nothing
but the dream of a wrinkly old man.

09:04.075 --> 09:09.313
Man, I've gotten a lot hairier, but
also balder. Tell me how that makes any

09:09.380 --> 09:11.949
sense. I look like a
big, old hairy raisin.

09:12.016 --> 09:17.254
- So, wait, what happens to you when
we wake him up? - Poof! I'm a goner.

09:17.322 --> 09:21.992
- Thus ends mighty Prismo.
- Prismo. - Killing a wishmaster is a

09:22.060 --> 09:26.229
cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian
will show up and take you to the

09:26.297 --> 09:30.000
- Citadel. - I don't think seeing
my dad is worth sacrificing your

09:30.068 --> 09:33.136
- life. - Ah, don't worry!
As soon as my corporeal body

09:33.204 --> 09:38.041
- falls asleep again... in a thousand
years, I'll be back. - You sure about this?

09:38.109 --> 09:43.780
Hold on, let me take one last look
around. Huh, thought I'd own more stuff

09:43.881 --> 09:47.684
- by now. Okay, let's do it.
- Still feels like a bad

09:47.752 --> 09:51.154
- idea, man.
- Psh, what could go wrong?

09:55.927 --> 10:00.864
- Wake up. - But wait!
I've changed my mind!

10:00.932 --> 10:03.233
(gasps) (gasps)
Prismo, don't worry!

10:03.301 --> 10:06.937
- I'll put the old man to sleep and get
you back! - Dude, that means the

10:07.038 --> 10:09.940
- Lich jacked our entry into
the Citadel! - Aw, no, man!

10:10.008 --> 10:15.312
- How you gonna see your dad?! - Hello?
Who are you guys? Could any of you

10:15.413 --> 10:19.016
strangers tell me how to go
home? I'm done with my nap.

10:19.083 --> 10:26.023
- Old man Prismo. (breathing heavily)
- I just woke up from my nap.

10:26.090 --> 10:31.061
Uh... But I'm ready to go back to
bed. I'd like to go home and take a

10:31.129 --> 10:35.265
- nap. - No, old man
Prismo. Don't talk to him!

10:35.333 --> 10:37.834
Are you my son?

10:40.938 --> 10:49.346
(gasps) (growling)
Old man Prismo! No!

10:49.414 --> 10:56.319
Lich, I'm gonna kill you!
(screams) (laughs)

10:56.421 --> 11:02.826
(static warbles)
(ice creaking) (laughs)

11:02.894 --> 11:07.397
(laughing stops) Oh, dang!
I think they're going to the

11:07.465 --> 11:10.734
Citadel.
I'm coming, daddyyy!

(both grunt)

11:29.681 --> 11:33.650
Look, Jake, more guardians.
The Citadel, I presume.

11:33.718 --> 11:38.155
- Likely so. - Hey, do you think
maybe one of them could be my dad?

11:38.223 --> 11:41.325
Nah, I don't think so. We'll
probably know when we see him.

11:41.392 --> 11:49.433
Right. Right.
That makes sense. (humming)

11:49.500 --> 11:55.172
(static warbles) Hey, the Lich, again.
This must be where the prison

11:55.240 --> 11:58.308
cells be at. See?
Good riddance, too.

11:58.409 --> 12:02.246
I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk
flapper. Some people just make the world

12:02.313 --> 12:07.017
a worse place to be, just by being
around, Jake. That's right. Bad apples.

12:07.085 --> 12:10.454
Lock 'em all up, I say, at the bottom of
the ocean, where it's too dark to see.

12:10.521 --> 12:14.258
Look at that weird, old kid down
there. He looks just like you.

12:14.325 --> 12:20.063
- Man, look at his clothes.
- Daddyyy! - Wup!

12:20.131 --> 12:22.966
(thud!)
Aah!

12:29.440 --> 12:33.477
All locked up in there. Do you
think maybe he's a criminal, too?

12:33.578 --> 12:37.414
Well, it had crossed my mind.
(groans)

12:37.482 --> 12:41.385
Geez, man! I wish I hadn't
said all that stuff before.

12:41.452 --> 12:45.255
Now my heart feels yellow
and green. (groans loudly)

12:45.323 --> 12:48.125
(sighs) Maybe we shouldn't
even have come here.

12:48.192 --> 12:51.161
- Whaaaaaa?! (blowing rapidly)
- Jake, what did you do?!

12:51.262 --> 12:55.165
- It wasn't me! It came
from up there! - Gah!

12:55.266 --> 13:00.404
He's melting the crystal all up!
Breaking cats out left and right!

13:00.471 --> 13:05.242
- Turning cats grey! (roars)
- Did he trick us, again?

13:05.310 --> 13:09.446
- I think he did. - Hey, kid!
(blows) Hey, do me a favor.

13:09.514 --> 13:18.221
Get me out of here, huh? This fire
smells crazy! (glass shatters)

13:18.289 --> 13:21.525
(groans) Thanks, kid. Now, where'd
you guys park your starskipper?

13:21.592 --> 13:26.129
This place is coming down quick, and
I'm talking quick like zip-zip, like wow.

13:26.197 --> 13:30.967
- Like boom-boom wow. (whimpers)
- Oh, we... we don't have

13:31.035 --> 13:35.339
- a starskipper. - Also,
Finn's your son. - Whaaat?!

13:35.406 --> 13:39.609
- No starskipper. (clears throat)
- I said, "Finn's your son".

13:39.677 --> 13:44.681
- He came a long way to meet you.
- Son? Oh! Hey, good for you, kid.

13:44.749 --> 13:48.518
In other news, I still got to get out
of here, and the ground is melting.

13:48.586 --> 13:52.489
- Huh. It's all pooling in the center.
- Hey, um, I... I wanted

13:52.557 --> 13:55.992
- to ask you something.
I... Well... - Hup!

13:56.060 --> 14:07.270
Hey, wait up! (muffled)
Dad! Wait! (gasps)

14:07.338 --> 14:12.442
(both gasping) Dad, I wanted
to ask you... Whoaaaah!

14:12.543 --> 14:20.584
Aaaah! (all groaning,
gasping) (coughing)

14:20.651 --> 14:29.159
Aah! (energy warbles,
train whistle blows)

14:29.227 --> 14:32.429
- No! - Gree nah gah
bah ga da da brahdada!

14:32.497 --> 14:37.667
- Gra gra gra gra bra! (laughs)
- Finn, I know we

14:37.735 --> 14:42.105
normally come out of these things okay,
but I got a bad feeling about this.

14:42.173 --> 14:47.043
Just promise me... If both my eyes get
fried off, you'll fry yours off, too.

14:47.111 --> 14:51.147
What? No. Listen,
you don't got to worry

14:51.215 --> 14:55.418
about a thing, Jake old pal. We just need to
defeat those five space villains, hijack the

14:55.486 --> 14:58.755
shard they're hijacking, and sail
it home to safety. Easy peasy.

14:58.856 --> 15:03.827
Yeah, Jake, smarten up. Soon as the
last guardian dies, the fighting stops.

15:03.894 --> 15:09.299
See? He's biting the dust
right now. (screams)

15:09.367 --> 15:13.269
(groans) Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh,
uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh...

15:13.337 --> 15:17.340
(weakly) - It's... Okay. It's okay.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

15:17.441 --> 15:22.379
- Uh-oh, uh-oh. - You just got to fetch
me a gob of that guardian blood, son.

15:22.446 --> 15:26.716
- It's got that good nooch that keeps
us young in the crystal. - Nooch?

15:26.784 --> 15:30.587
- Come on, now, partner. No
doddling. Your old man needs you.

15:30.655 --> 15:35.859
(tink!) (sighs)
Attaboy, Flynn!

15:35.926 --> 15:41.731
Do it for your old man! Yeah, just
get right in there! Don't be shy!

15:41.799 --> 15:47.570
(grunting) (splash!)
Yeah!

15:47.638 --> 15:51.741
Hey, good job, son. Now rub
some of that sap on my leg there.

15:51.809 --> 15:55.812
Make sure to get it into the
chicken-wing hole. (groans)

15:55.913 --> 15:59.649
- Dad? - Martin.
- Okay, Martin.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.619
- We need to talk. - Yeah,
okay, kid, but hurry it up.

16:02.687 --> 16:08.358
I'm trying to act cool here, but this
thing really stings! (inhales deeply)

16:08.426 --> 16:14.330
- Why did you abandon me in the forest when
I was a little baby? - Oh! I mean (chuckles)

16:14.398 --> 16:18.401
- you know me. I'm a funny guy.
- Wha... Wha...

16:18.502 --> 16:21.771
(exhales deeply) I don't know.
It was a long time ago.

16:21.839 --> 16:29.345
Who knows? Like, maybe
you left me. (sighs)

16:29.447 --> 16:35.552
But, hey, daddy's back! (grunts)
You and me, daddy and baby.

16:35.653 --> 16:42.625
Or should I say, "baby and
daddy"? Now slap that sap.

16:42.693 --> 16:49.299
(groans) Uck.

16:55.272 --> 17:01.177
Whoa! Would you look at
that? Smooth like new. (scoffs)

17:01.245 --> 17:05.982
- Couldn't fix the boot, too, huh? - Dude,
s'mores important junk happening!

17:06.050 --> 17:11.454
Look! (bubbling)
It's time to peel

17:11.521 --> 17:16.726
bananas on this fool... as a
family! How about it, Martin?

17:16.894 --> 17:21.830
- Dad? - I got to run
to the store! (groans)

17:21.932 --> 17:25.135
(explosion)
Huh?

17:29.173 --> 17:34.043
Fall.
(groans softly)

17:37.515 --> 17:44.687
(laughs) (groans)
You are alone, child.

17:44.755 --> 17:47.257
(groans)

17:50.661 --> 17:54.764
There is only darkness for you,
and only death for your people.

17:54.832 --> 18:00.536
These ancients are just the beginning.
I will command a great and

18:00.604 --> 18:05.308
- terrible army. (groaning weakly)
- And we will sail to a billion

18:05.409 --> 18:11.781
worlds. We will sail until every
light has been extinguished.

18:11.849 --> 18:22.225
You are strong, child. But I am
beyond strength. I am the end.

18:22.293 --> 18:26.963
And I have come for you, Finn.
(groans weakly) (gasps)

18:27.031 --> 18:37.774
Gah! (groaning)
What?

18:37.875 --> 18:39.842
You don't like this stuff, huh?

18:50.621 --> 18:56.492
(whimpering)
Right in the doorbell. Dad!

18:56.560 --> 19:00.263
- Jake, finish off the Lich! I got to
go catch my dad! - Dude, forget that

19:00.331 --> 19:08.875
- loser! (humming)
- Dad! Wait!

19:12.943 --> 19:19.682
Hey, cool guys. Looking
for a new boss? (tink!)

19:19.783 --> 19:26.723
(chomping) Chew faster.
That guy's really moving.

19:26.790 --> 19:31.527
(rip!) Hyup! Ugh!
(groaning)

19:31.628 --> 19:42.839
- Dad, stop!
- Finn! (groans)

19:42.940 --> 19:49.946
- Martin, I won't let you escape!
- Hey, hey! You're a void caster, right?

19:50.047 --> 19:58.588
We got to put some... Gas in
this buggy. (energy warbles)

19:58.855 --> 20:08.097
Finn, let go! He's not
worth it! (screaming)

20:08.165 --> 20:14.737
(gasps) Oh, gross!
Pedal to the medal.

20:14.838 --> 20:21.043
(energy warbles)
(screams)

20:23.847 --> 20:28.784
(gasps)
Hey, what about air...

20:53.744 --> 20:55.945
It'll be okay, dude.

21:04.254 --> 21:08.858
(sighs) I mean, at least you
finished off the Lich, right?

21:08.925 --> 21:11.727
Oh, yeah, that's the good
news. I didn't have to.

21:11.795 --> 21:18.834
One sec. Up you go!
Check this out.

21:18.902 --> 21:24.140
Brand-new baby. The Lich is super
cute now, and he smells real neat.

21:24.207 --> 21:28.110
That sap rebooted him
or something. (lips pop)

21:28.178 --> 21:34.717
- I like him a lot. (train
whistle blows) - Over here, fellas!

21:34.785 --> 21:40.124
Next stop... The Candy Kingdom.
Previous stop... This weird place.

21:42.192 --> 21:47.096
Mr. Pig, I think we should
get a d... (doorbell rings)

21:47.164 --> 21:55.838
- Okay, run. Go, go, go!
- Oh! Oh, this changes everything!

21:56.306 --> 21:57.707
