08:45.700 --> 08:48.220
chased him through the woods

But he escaped.

I smelt the ribbon.

42:21.580 --> 42:25.340
Pepper, you are to be a Pa.
And I'm to be a Ma.

42:26.820 --> 42:28.940
So we must marry.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.420
You lied to me.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.020
You promised me
you would not love me.

42:52.860 --> 42:55.300
But I saw it in your eyes
as you healed my wound.

42:58.060 --> 43:00.060
I saw a longing.

43:05.180 --> 43:07.540
(SIGHS) It's fools and dupes
who love.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.380
Weaklings who trust.

43:19.340 --> 43:21.780
We have a long journey home.

43:24.860 --> 43:27.340
Time enough for you
to convince yourself of that.

43:32.900 --> 43:34.900
(CHUCKLES)

43:51.220 --> 43:54.740
Opechancanough has changed his name.
That could be a war name.

43:54.820 --> 43:57.220
If you believe him
trampled underfoot,

43:57.300 --> 43:59.900
then your mind is diseased
with arrogancy.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.940
(SPEAKING ALGONQUIAN)

44:03.060 --> 44:06.940
If I stay, I'll be your prisoner.
Fortune favours us who last.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.940
We can have land and whatever life
we choose to have.

44:10.020 --> 44:14.380
You are the most beautiful bride
ever walked into that church.
Am I truly?

44:14.460 --> 44:16.620
Why would the Pamunkey
want war now, Henry?

44:16.700 --> 44:19.020
I hope they don't.
But we will be ready.
