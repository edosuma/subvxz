00:36.837 --> 00:38.539
My desk beckons.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.774
Where are we?

00:40.841 --> 00:43.744
About two feet above the floor.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.419
[groans]

00:56.357 --> 00:59.827
Let's stay.
It's like a museum.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.562
Zelda, we gotta get home.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.864
- Man: They're finally awake.
- Harvey.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.301
- So, this is your place.
- You broke my elevator.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.870
As I said last night,
Coney Island
is a better choice

01:09.937 --> 01:11.672

01:11.739 --> 01:12.840
Remind me who you are?

01:12.906 --> 01:16.043
Oh, Zelda, this is
Harvey Firestone, Jr.,

01:16.144 --> 01:18.246
of the tire and rubber
Firestones.

01:18.312 --> 01:22.550
Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald
of the judgmental Sayres.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.153
Even at Princeton,
Scott was famous for
going for girls

01:25.219 --> 01:26.654
far out of his league.

01:26.720 --> 01:27.997
Well, that's what happens
when you're in

01:28.021 --> 01:29.022
a league of your own.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.391
So I'm told.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.161
Voice of our generation,
right, Fitz?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.028
It's always a pleasure, Harvey.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.665
Come on, Zelda.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.500
Happy birthday to you.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.169
And try not to break
anything else
on your way out.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.238
[laughing]

01:45.973 --> 01:47.040
What's wrong with him?

01:47.175 --> 01:48.376
Oh, he's rich.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.278
They like to
set themselves apart.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.347
Luddy has piles of money,
and he's not such a high hat.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.183
Well, there's having money,

01:55.249 --> 01:57.351
and then there's being rich.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.287
Well, then, let's never be rich.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.356
Oh, never, my darling.
I vow it.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.429
Why'd we go in this entrance?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.663
Oh, because change of pace.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.866
And this door is fantastic.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.970
Man: Uh, Mr. Fitzgerald.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.306
- Oh.
- Do you have a moment?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.674
- Mr. Fitzgerald.
- Mm.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.976
- Moment of your time, sir.
- Yes.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.445
We have something to discuss.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.256
We'll keep it down.
It's a writing day today.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.748
But tonight's a different story.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.483
Let's see how fast
you can get it to 8.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.952

03:04.017 --> 03:06.254
I'm sure what you're writing
is wonderful.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.422

03:10.624 --> 03:13.427
Do you hear a baby crying?

Come in.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.017
What happened to
the old Victrola?

03:37.084 --> 03:38.752
It broke.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.288
- You bought a new Victrola?
- Maybe.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.124
Why, I just asked them
to get another one like
the old one.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.827
- Zelda, we...
- We what?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.031
Never mind.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.199
One minute.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.367
Thank you.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.202
Oh, and...

03:55.303 --> 03:57.771
There is a baby that
has been squawling
for an hour.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.408
Please do something
to make it stop.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.310
I don't hear a baby, sir.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.044
You don't?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.814
Well, it's off and on.
It... It's maddening.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.716
Well, you could play
some music, sir.

that's not the new novel.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.985
What if I'm no better

05:52.052 --> 05:54.688
You are not your father.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.924
And I will never let you fail.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.666

06:05.733 --> 06:07.167

department at Princeton?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.276
Ah.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.912
It's from Professor Gauss.

06:18.979 --> 06:23.016
He was
the one professor there
that was worth a damn.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.251
He's invited me to speak.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.786
"An acknowledgement
and celebration

06:25.853 --> 06:27.455
"of your tremendous
achievement."

06:39.199 --> 06:40.801

06:40.868 --> 06:43.136
You do that

06:50.778 --> 06:52.312

06:53.781 --> 06:58.151

Harvey and his ilk.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.734
Everyone, period,

07:13.801 --> 07:16.336

Ah, and who are you, young man?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.558
What is your business here?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.327
Lawrence Calderwood, sir.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.528
Class of '22.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.605
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.197
I needed to get a book.

12:44.264 --> 12:49.302
Well, here is the only book
you'll ever need to read.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.239
All of the smart young men
are mad over it.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.142
I've, uh...
I've read it twice.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.644
I'm a big fan of yours,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.179
I think your talk this afternoon

12:59.246 --> 13:01.581
is gonna be the highlight
of my year.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.884
Oh, Scott.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.518
Can we keep him?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.620
Lawrence, clear your schedule.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.957
I'm in dire need of a protégé.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.524
Meet downstairs, noon.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.859
Do excuse us.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.062
Mr. Fitzgerald and I
need to continue

13:15.128 --> 13:17.464
our discussion about
the literary canon.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.866
Privately.

13:21.869 --> 13:25.072
- [bell tolling]
- [chattering]

13:25.138 --> 13:26.873
Zelda: It must get
awfully lonely around here

13:26.874 --> 13:28.441
without any women.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.877
Oh, there were women.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.387
They just weren't
students. [chuckles]

13:31.411 --> 13:33.146
So, let me guess, Lawrence.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.648
Your father was
a Princeton man, too.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.883
- I'm third generation.
- Mm-hm.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.451
Both grandfathers.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.554
And I take it
the money's not gonna
run out any time soon.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.056
I suppose not.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.724
See, this is the rub.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.726
The truly rich
never have to worry about

13:46.793 --> 13:48.295
it all getting away from them.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.530
I don't know what
you're talkin' about,
Goofo.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.175
You're the best selling
author of the year,

13:52.199 --> 13:53.800
and no one's
taking that away from you.

13:53.901 --> 13:57.737
Lawrence, tell us
what you like most
about Scott's book.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.739
Well, uh...

13:59.806 --> 14:01.909
- it captures youth.
- Mm-hm.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.476
- And rebellion.
- Hm.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.946
And it takes a hatchet
to everything else.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.948
Unlike all the books
they make us read here.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.216
Here, here.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.051
I made myself
a summer reading list.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.986
Mackenzie, Wells.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.031
All the authors
Professor Bailey said
you borrowed from.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.090
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

14:17.157 --> 14:19.402
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that...
- No. No, no.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.462
Lawrence, every first novel, uh,

14:22.529 --> 14:24.664
- displays the author's
influences.
- Yes.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.533
What's important is
his second book.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.236
Which the author must make
entirely his own.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.139
- Right, Scott?
- Absolutely.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.242
Tell us about your
second book, Scott.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.010
Tell us about
your first book, Bunny.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.012
- [chuckles]
- Scott.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.248
Let's go to the book store.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.849
I want to see the display.

14:42.950 --> 14:46.586

You're supposed to order more.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.144
Yes, how can he
sign your copies if
you don't have any?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.412
President Hibben was upset

15:12.479 --> 15:13.856
with the portrayal
of the university,

15:13.880 --> 15:16.216
and doesn't want it
sold on campus.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.584
So why have I come?

15:17.650 --> 15:20.087
Just to be judged

15:20.153 --> 15:21.988
Professor Gauss invited you.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.523
He believes in you.

15:30.397 --> 15:34.034
Here. Here.
Sign this for Lawrence.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.535

15:35.602 --> 15:39.839
Mackenzie inspired you,
and you inspired Lawrence.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.508
Isn't that right, Lawrence?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.009
Absolutely.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.220
- You can't do that.
- No, no, no, no.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.147
He has money.
He's buying it.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.457
Ah, here.
You stole from
this one, too.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.433

Yeah, why the hell not?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.902

- You should thank Wells.

my boy.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.092
Indeed.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.992
Professor Gauss,
I'm Zelda, Scott's wife.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.428
I'm so honored to meet you.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.663
The pleasure is
all mine, my dear.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.633
Congratulations on your
tremendous success with
the book.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.169
Yes, I hear Hibben
doesn't like it.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.137
The president isn't
a literary man, is he?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.406
So, what can you expect.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.108
[chuckles]
Little to nothing.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.344
Let's go inside.
We're ready for you.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.921
Should we wait for
the rest of the department?

17:34.987 --> 17:38.125
Oh, uh, no.
I believe we're all here.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.398
There's a baseball game
this afternoon.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.600
I wrote.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.178
I wrote this novel.

18:31.244 --> 18:36.048
But it's not a book that
any of you will ever assign
or value.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.750
Or even understand.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.356
No book of mine will ever be.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.358
And all the writing I've done,

18:45.425 --> 18:48.528
and will do, is in spite of you.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.400
You teach with two goals:

18:53.466 --> 18:56.303
To prop up literature
that is long dead,

18:56.369 --> 18:59.239
and to curry favor with
the wealthiest students

18:59.306 --> 19:01.674
just so that you can
indulge in the fantasy

19:01.741 --> 19:04.277
that you belong to their world.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.945
You don't.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.415
He never really
fit in here, did he?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.417
Not like he wanted to.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.320
You're not a part of
anyone's success.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.555
Most certainly not mine.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.258
You are fools and eunuchs,

19:18.325 --> 19:21.694
and you are pathetic,
tragic frauds.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.895
Hmph.

- We're so sorry.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.917
- Oh, no. We are
absolutely not sorry.
- All right, Fitz.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.676
You set them straight.
Time to move on.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.778
- Zelda: Scott.
- Can you take him back
to cottage?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.914
- Scott.
- Ludlow and I will try to
repair the damage here.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.552
