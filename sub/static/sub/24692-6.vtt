00:04.596 --> 00:07.191
In New York City's war on crime,

00:07.191 --> 00:10.248
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:10.248 --> 00:12.195
of the Major Case Squad.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.013
These are their stories.

00:21.527 --> 00:22.328
It's all set.

00:22.328 --> 00:25.161
Simon Fife's in custody of
the Ho Chi Minh city police.

00:25.161 --> 00:28.085
They'll hand him over to us
at gate 3 in ten minutes.

00:28.085 --> 00:30.283
Then what's our suspect 
doing up there?

00:34.467 --> 00:36.368
Is that live?

00:36.633 --> 00:38.479
Do you know where that is?

00:51.869 --> 00:53.730
Pardon us. Excuse us.

00:53.730 --> 00:56.688
Mr. Fife, did you kill Amberleigh Harner?

00:56.688 --> 01:00.752
Amberleigh is still with us
if we're pure enough to hear her.

01:00.752 --> 01:02.280
Why did you kill Amberleigh?

01:02.280 --> 01:04.328
She died...

01:04.328 --> 01:06.829
inadvertently.

01:07.249 --> 01:09.539
In a moment of intense love.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.226
Excuse us.

01:11.547 --> 01:12.557
Out of the way!

01:12.557 --> 01:14.475
Mr. Fife, tell us about your love.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.033
NYPD!

01:16.033 --> 01:18.813
Look, folks, move out of the way.
There's no more questions.

01:18.813 --> 01:19.829
Thank you, please.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.054
Did he kill her? Are you sure?

01:21.054 --> 01:22.601
Simon Henry Fife?

01:22.601 --> 01:25.253
NYPD. He's in our custody now.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.530
Simon, are you ready?

01:26.530 --> 01:28.793
- How are you feeling?
- Back off!

01:28.793 --> 01:30.775
Autumn in New York?

01:30.775 --> 01:32.144
It's time I go home.

01:32.144 --> 01:34.152
- All right.
- Excuse me, stand back.

01:37.018 --> 01:38.527
Out of the way.

Keep this on ice.

02:34.549 --> 02:35.859
Simon?

02:37.139 --> 02:38.568
Simon?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.201
You must not fly much.

02:42.201 --> 02:44.346
You haven't taken your eyes
off the window.

02:44.346 --> 02:46.510
I've flown many times.

02:46.846 --> 02:50.985
I just haven't numbed myself
to the miracle.

02:51.905 --> 02:55.145
Sit down, or I'll throw you off.

02:56.657 --> 03:00.639
Reporters. No shame.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.336
The pain they caused Beth.

03:04.863 --> 03:07.922
Beth. Amberleigh's mother?

03:07.922 --> 03:11.211
Mr. Nate Royce helped me
understand the pain she went through.

03:11.211 --> 03:14.139
Nate Royce. That's their
next door neighbor.

03:14.139 --> 03:15.721
Beth's protector,

03:15.721 --> 03:19.764
and my email confidant
for the last three months.

03:25.974 --> 03:28.689
He turned me in, didn't he?

03:30.613 --> 03:32.078
The DA didn't brief us.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.266
We found out about this thing
an hour before we got on the plane.

03:35.266 --> 03:37.304
The time had come.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.215
Sorry, time? To confess?

03:40.215 --> 03:46.060
The time the world heard
the story of a pure love,

03:46.060 --> 03:51.529
and of a world so corrupt,
it had to force that love into darkness...

03:53.472 --> 03:56.127
where it perished.

04:12.562 --> 04:15.295
They all look sweet
when they're sleeping.

04:15.295 --> 04:18.829
But this is one sick puppy.

04:18.829 --> 04:21.298
He is Simon Henry Fife,

04:21.298 --> 04:24.224
and tonight he is in NYPD custody.

04:24.224 --> 04:26.731
After 14 years,

04:26.731 --> 04:30.065
the Halloween murder
of Amberleigh Harner...

04:30.065 --> 04:33.769
this angel, killed in the basement
of her Brooklyn home,

04:33.769 --> 04:36.365
has at last been solved.

04:36.365 --> 04:39.619
Bethany Harner, Amberleigh's mother,

04:39.619 --> 04:41.830
are there any words?

04:41.830 --> 04:47.168
I have waited so long
for justice, Faith.

04:47.168 --> 04:49.495
She was...

04:49.495 --> 04:50.988
my star.

04:50.988 --> 04:55.287
Your neighbor, Mr. Nate Royce,
led them to the killer.

04:55.287 --> 04:58.774
Without your perseverance,
Fife would still be in Vietnam.

04:58.774 --> 05:00.395
If you haven't lost your lunch yet,

05:00.395 --> 05:02.488
here's another photo.

05:02.801 --> 05:05.807
Nate, how did you trap this predator?

05:05.807 --> 05:08.605
He emailed me about three months ago.

05:08.605 --> 05:10.022
Because of your book?

05:10.022 --> 05:12.033
He wasn't the first sicko to reach out,

05:12.033 --> 05:15.428
but something in his emails unsettled me.

05:17.042 --> 05:19.200
I wonder what it was.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.087
I stopped reading when I got to Fife's line
about how he made love to Amberleigh

05:23.087 --> 05:25.067
while commingling their blood.

05:25.067 --> 05:28.415
There was no blood in the basement,
except for Amberleigh's.

05:33.955 --> 05:36.328
How much champagne
did you let him drink?

05:36.328 --> 05:38.534
Hope you got something good out of him.

05:38.534 --> 05:41.596
Well, he idealizes children,
he demonizes adults.

05:41.596 --> 05:45.494
He was most likely abused by a parent.

05:45.494 --> 05:49.173
I don't suppose you asked him if he was
in Brooklyn on Halloween night, 1992?

05:49.173 --> 05:51.623
Well, that's not exactly
a first interview question.

05:51.623 --> 05:55.561
Detective, I don't care about Fife's
childhood pain or his world view.

05:55.561 --> 05:57.384
Brooklyn homicide botched this case.
That's why it was kicked to us.

05:57.384 --> 05:59.789
- I was just trying to gain his trust.
- That's why it was kicked to us.

05:59.789 --> 06:01.252
Before Fife lawyers up...

06:01.252 --> 06:02.550
What do you want me to do,
go old school,

06:02.550 --> 06:05.672
slap him around with a phone book
until he confesses?

06:07.308 --> 06:09.030
I want the same thing you want,

06:09.030 --> 06:12.329
to be absolutely sure
he killed Amberleigh.

06:15.692 --> 06:17.084
Oh, he killed her.

06:17.084 --> 06:19.486
The detail in his emails,
his knowledge of her home...

06:19.486 --> 06:21.744
Amberleigh's become an icon
since her death.

06:21.744 --> 06:23.407
There's a lot of information out there.

06:23.407 --> 06:24.556
Yes, I know, detectives.

06:24.556 --> 06:27.174
And hundreds of people confessed to
killing the Lindbergh baby,

06:27.174 --> 06:29.285
- but Hauptmann did it.
- Okay, fine.

06:29.285 --> 06:31.528
Is there anything linking Fife
to the scene of the crime?

06:31.528 --> 06:33.733
NYPD never secured the crime scene.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.609
A dozen people tramped through
that basement

06:35.609 --> 06:37.014
before her body was found.

06:37.014 --> 06:38.726
So that's a no?

06:39.125 --> 06:41.667
There was a ransom call
from a phone booth at night.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.583
A woman's voice, right?

06:42.583 --> 06:44.224
"Feminine," I believe, is the word.

06:44.224 --> 06:46.897
And Fife? Well, you've met him.

06:46.897 --> 06:50.371
Any proof Fife ever met Amberleigh,
stalked her?

06:50.371 --> 06:51.963
Our investigators are looking into it.

06:51.963 --> 06:53.483
In the meantime, let's arraign him.

06:53.483 --> 06:55.193
In the meantime, let's not.

06:55.193 --> 06:57.318
He's comfortable in our custody.

06:57.318 --> 06:59.262
The longer we hold him,
the more he talks,

06:59.262 --> 07:01.735
the better you look when you convict.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.809
- I'd have to talk to...
- Go ahead.

07:04.809 --> 07:06.432
We'll wait.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.838
24 hours, if we're lucky.

07:12.838 --> 07:15.960
A 14-year-old unsolved case,
24 hours to solve it?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.092
Maybe someone close
to Amberleigh can place him.

07:18.092 --> 07:22.305
It won't be easy,
the mother hasn't spoken to NYPD
since the night of the murder.

07:22.305 --> 07:23.526
And the ex-husband?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.137
Away on business the night of the murder,

07:25.137 --> 07:26.984
remarried, and moved out west.

07:26.984 --> 07:28.953
Pay a visit to Amberleigh's mother.

07:28.953 --> 07:30.688
Find out if she had ever seen Fife

07:30.688 --> 07:33.572
before he crawled out
of his Vietnamese sewer.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.593
She's away, detectives.

07:46.564 --> 07:49.395
You're Nate Royce, the author?

07:49.395 --> 07:52.342
The friend and neighbor.

07:52.666 --> 07:56.267
Beth disappears around Halloween,
too many gawkers coming by the house.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.611
I'm surprised she kept this home.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.960
It's been hard for her to move on.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.388
I think now she'll be able to.

08:03.718 --> 08:06.113
You mean, if Fife is guilty.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.261
Did you ever see Fife
watching Amberleigh?

08:09.261 --> 08:14.506
No, but he knew about the blood
on the couch, the open dryer door.

08:14.506 --> 08:17.448
Yeah, but still, you know, her murder,

08:17.448 --> 08:20.635
this home invasion homicide,
it was bold.

08:20.900 --> 08:25.820
And, uh, you've been fooled
by his whimsical child/man character.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.643
You think it's an act, a persona?

08:27.643 --> 08:30.530
That he might have created this...

08:30.530 --> 08:32.549
love affair he has with Amberleigh?

08:32.549 --> 08:34.976
I think he's pathological,
not creative.

08:34.976 --> 08:36.672
Well, you'd know.

08:36.672 --> 08:37.912
He creates characters.

08:37.912 --> 08:39.357
You were a novelist, weren't you?

08:39.357 --> 08:42.803
I was, until that awful night.

08:42.803 --> 08:47.028
You found a way to be of service.
Your book, website.

08:47.028 --> 08:50.070
I did what I could for Amberleigh.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.027
It's been...

08:52.027 --> 08:53.556
it's been hell.

08:53.556 --> 08:55.836
My wife died four years
after Amberleigh,

08:55.836 --> 08:59.513
and I've had to raise
our young son alone.

08:59.513 --> 09:02.690
Well, Beth Harner
is very lucky to have you.

09:02.690 --> 09:04.397
And we need to get in touch with her.

09:04.397 --> 09:07.217
She won't talk to NYPD,
you know that.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.231
Mr. Royce, we know that
mistakes were made.

09:09.231 --> 09:11.632
I could try to talk to her.

09:11.632 --> 09:14.512
She'll be angry if she knows
I even let you walk on her property.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.736
It's the captain.
Fife is getting antsy.

09:16.736 --> 09:18.797
He wants to speak to you.

09:21.456 --> 09:23.388
Where's Bobby?
He believes me.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.754
He does, I don't.

09:24.754 --> 09:26.598
You ask me,
you made the whole thing up.

09:26.598 --> 09:29.274
- That's crazy.
- You said it.

09:30.509 --> 09:32.574
She was my girlfriend.

09:32.574 --> 09:35.333
Right. And you met her where?

09:35.577 --> 09:37.127
We met at her school.

09:37.127 --> 09:38.979
I worked as a nurse.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.637
And on Halloween night...

09:41.847 --> 09:43.965
I made love to her.

09:43.965 --> 09:47.882
There were no signs of love-making.

09:47.882 --> 09:49.760
You don't believe me.
You want proof?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.336
How about her stomach contents?

09:51.336 --> 09:52.717
Halloween?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.184
You're gonna guess candy.

09:54.184 --> 09:56.550
Just sesame logs.

09:56.883 --> 09:58.865
She loved them.

10:00.242 --> 10:02.785
I'm checking, checking.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.099
They blacked it out.

10:05.099 --> 10:09.063
She gorged on sweet honey
sesame candy

10:09.063 --> 10:11.253
while I made love to her...

10:11.253 --> 10:13.468
on the night...

10:13.727 --> 10:15.722
she left us.

10:26.678 --> 10:28.078
The ME confirmed it.

10:28.078 --> 10:30.972
Amberleigh ate sesame candy
in the last hours of her life.

10:30.972 --> 10:33.450
That was kept out of the autopsy report.

10:33.450 --> 10:36.102
Never published, never leaked.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.391
The department of Ed confirms

10:37.391 --> 10:41.865
Fife worked as a nurse at Amberleigh's
school for two weeks that September.

10:41.865 --> 10:44.207
A lot of people worked at her school.

10:44.207 --> 10:46.084
I told the DA we'd strengthen her case.

10:46.084 --> 10:46.949
You've done that.

10:46.949 --> 10:50.248
The DA told you that we had 24 hours.

10:50.248 --> 10:52.103
We haven't been into the crime scene.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.512
We haven't interviewed Beth.

10:53.512 --> 10:54.975
You know the DA's office.

10:54.975 --> 10:56.368
This case collapses,

10:56.368 --> 10:59.245
they'll spin it so everybody thinks
we botched it again.

10:59.245 --> 11:00.825
And this case collapses how?

11:00.825 --> 11:02.384
The ransom demand.

11:02.384 --> 11:05.024
The caller said,
"we have your whore daughter."

11:05.024 --> 11:08.460
Fife thinks he made
gentle love to Amberleigh.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.554
Different fantasy.

11:10.554 --> 11:12.536
Okay. Keep the clock running.

11:12.536 --> 11:14.538
Get a search warrant
for the Harner home.

11:14.538 --> 11:17.106
Track down the detective who
first responded to the scene.

11:17.106 --> 11:18.626
It wasn't a detective.

11:18.626 --> 11:21.506
She was a rookie, Linda Bonnardi.

11:22.584 --> 11:24.905
Right, I forgot.
She'd just graduated.

11:24.905 --> 11:26.036
Four months out.

11:26.036 --> 11:27.814
A year later, when I went to the academy,

11:27.814 --> 11:31.067
they were using her
as an example in class,

11:31.067 --> 11:33.877
to prove that women
were too emotional to be cops.

11:33.877 --> 11:36.629
She left the force in disgrace.

11:37.346 --> 11:38.749
Find her.

11:52.009 --> 11:53.897
Happy Halloween.

11:55.577 --> 11:59.673
4 A.M. the mother, Beth,
she's totally hysterical.

11:59.673 --> 12:03.420
Said she heard the kid scream,
ran to her bedroom.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.309
Kid's gone.

12:07.085 --> 12:10.364
10 or 15 minutes later,
she gets a ransom call.

12:10.364 --> 12:12.191
"We have your whore daughter."

12:12.191 --> 12:14.876
"We'll call back at 6.
Don't tell anyone."

12:14.876 --> 12:16.411
That's when she called us.

12:16.411 --> 12:19.655
And you searched the house?

12:19.655 --> 12:22.368
And Matt interviewed Beth.

12:22.368 --> 12:23.615
Big mistake.

12:23.615 --> 12:26.077
Beth had made phone calls
before we arrived.

12:26.077 --> 12:29.049
So while I'm searching,
people keep showing up.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.587
People? The Royces.

12:30.587 --> 12:32.713
You mean Nate and Madeline?

12:32.713 --> 12:34.490
And their kid.

12:34.490 --> 12:35.878
Weird, right?

12:35.878 --> 12:38.161
And you didn't call for backup?

12:38.161 --> 12:39.713
I thought it was a prank.

12:39.713 --> 12:41.806
But there was a ransom call.

12:42.712 --> 12:43.899
I didn't believe her.

12:43.899 --> 12:45.255
You get a call like that,

12:45.255 --> 12:47.249
"we have your whore daughter,
don't tell anybody,"

12:47.249 --> 12:49.717
and you invite ten friends over?

12:49.717 --> 12:51.630
Mm-hmm, I see your point.

12:51.630 --> 12:52.966
And the caller,

12:52.966 --> 12:54.761
she said she'd call back at 6.

12:54.761 --> 12:57.988
At 6, Beth is on the phone.

12:58.202 --> 13:00.139
I tell her, "hang up."

13:00.139 --> 13:04.051
That 6 o'clock call should've been
all she was thinking about.

13:05.996 --> 13:08.622
Who went into the basement?

13:08.622 --> 13:11.172
I did, with Beth.

13:31.787 --> 13:33.991
Nothing's changed.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.682
That cellar door wasn't open,

13:42.682 --> 13:45.734
but it was not in its locked position.

13:45.972 --> 13:47.197
You noticed that?

13:47.197 --> 13:50.296
No. Beth did, uh...
right away.

13:51.130 --> 13:54.284
Then I noticed the dryer door ajar.

13:54.505 --> 13:56.413
The light is on.

13:56.774 --> 13:58.592
I open it.

14:00.367 --> 14:03.321
For a second, I thought
she was sleeping.

14:07.857 --> 14:11.461
You let Beth take the body out.

14:11.670 --> 14:14.420
I let her lead me to the body.

14:15.528 --> 14:17.280
She killed her daughter.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.560
And because of me,

14:19.848 --> 14:21.870
she got away with it.

14:29.158 --> 14:30.335
Thank you.

14:30.543 --> 14:33.254
Don't let her get away
with it this time.

14:35.773 --> 14:38.077
She was a female rookie,
wanted to prove herself,

14:38.077 --> 14:40.915
ended up making it harder
on the rest of us.

14:40.915 --> 14:46.355
Yeah, Beth Harner's behavior was
very, very strange that morning but,

14:46.355 --> 14:52.230
it's another rookie cop's mistake
to think that strange behavior equals guilt.

14:52.731 --> 14:54.464
Nate's still on duty.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.740
Mm-hmm, and he's on the phone.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.638
I wonder who he's talking to.

14:58.979 --> 15:00.906
No. There is nothing else.

15:00.906 --> 15:03.329
The DA has copies of everything.

15:03.329 --> 15:07.529
You're not writing a new book
about the case, are you?

15:07.529 --> 15:09.231
I'm just polishing it now, actually.

15:09.231 --> 15:11.330
Put you back on that bestsellers list.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.425
I am on your side.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.260
Then put us in touch with Beth Harner.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.386
- She would kill me, if I...
- What if I just hit the "redial"?

15:17.386 --> 15:19.535
Put that down! Please.

15:20.979 --> 15:23.889
I'm sorry,
I just try to protect her.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.815
Look, she told me
she had never met Fife.

15:25.815 --> 15:28.372
We like to get our information firsthand.

15:28.372 --> 15:31.501
And you wouldn't want something
to delay the publication of your book,

15:31.501 --> 15:34.851
like, say, a subpoena of your notes?

15:38.143 --> 15:38.977
Dad.

15:38.977 --> 15:40.945
Jamie, I thought you had a meeting.

15:40.945 --> 15:42.679
Hello to you too, dad.

15:42.679 --> 15:44.181
Everything okay?

15:44.181 --> 15:49.556
Yes, I'm just helping these detectives
get in touch with Beth.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.352
I am surprised
you even want my opinion.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.023
The New York police department
never believed a word I said.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.600
And that's the guy.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.975
I never saw him in the schoolyard,
but that's the guy.

16:00.975 --> 16:02.702
You took your daughter to school?

16:02.702 --> 16:05.400
I took my daughter to school every day.

16:06.570 --> 16:09.698
Unless, of course, she was,
please don't touch anything.

16:10.032 --> 16:13.083
Unless, of course, she was working.

16:13.083 --> 16:17.736
And then, we would run lines
together for her auditions.

16:17.736 --> 16:19.950
You'd run lines?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.892
You were an actress too, right?

16:21.892 --> 16:23.906
Oh, no, uh, no.

16:23.906 --> 16:27.841
Amberleigh was truly gifted.

16:27.841 --> 16:29.553
I was, well,

16:29.553 --> 16:32.367
I danced in the chorus
of a couple of shows,

16:32.367 --> 16:34.601
and weak knees ended that dream.

16:34.601 --> 16:36.903
Oh, your knees look fine.

16:36.903 --> 16:41.543
And your talent wasn't wasted.
You gave it to Amberleigh.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.904
Thank you very much.

16:43.904 --> 16:46.936
But it wasn't just me.
I mean, we had Jenna.

16:46.936 --> 16:48.171
Jenna?

16:48.171 --> 16:49.793
Yes.

16:49.793 --> 16:51.950
Amberleigh's acting coach...

16:51.950 --> 16:54.885
for all of her commercials,

16:54.885 --> 16:57.570
even the last one that she did
in September in L.A.

16:57.570 --> 16:59.074
Sep, September?

16:59.074 --> 17:01.351
Yes, right before...

17:06.526 --> 17:10.810
You know, Amberleigh loved acting.

17:12.255 --> 17:14.992
She loved Hollywood.

17:18.715 --> 17:21.792
Sweet and juicy.

17:23.588 --> 17:26.016
Her last commercial, it never aired.

17:26.016 --> 17:28.186
As you can see,
the camera loved her.

17:28.186 --> 17:29.750
Did she love the camera?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.503
That's a lot of pressure
on a young girl.

17:31.503 --> 17:33.012
Amberleigh was a professional.

17:33.012 --> 17:36.573
Even when she was unhappy,
she never projected it on-screen.

17:36.573 --> 17:38.959
Unhappy? Her mother said
that she loved acting.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.690
Oh, she did.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.979
This is the only time
I heard her complain.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.581
The shoot kept getting postponed.

17:44.581 --> 17:47.661
She was nervous about missing
the start of school.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.361
Do you happen to remember the dates?

17:51.361 --> 17:53.415
It's on the box sleeve.

17:53.764 --> 17:56.938
First two weeks, September 1992.

17:56.938 --> 17:58.831
Amberleigh was miserable.

17:58.831 --> 18:01.693
But you never saw it on her face.

18:08.383 --> 18:11.058
Sweet and juicy.

18:13.912 --> 18:16.455
Sweet and juicy.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.248
I jimmied the lock on the cellar door.

18:28.248 --> 18:30.315
That's how I got in.

18:30.604 --> 18:33.573
Simon, that door wasn't jimmied.

18:33.573 --> 18:34.826
The door was unlocked.

18:34.826 --> 18:36.195
No.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.223
That can't be.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.267
I snuck in through the cellar door.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.968
We'll put that aside for a moment.

18:46.825 --> 18:50.076
What do you do, usually, on Halloween?

18:50.076 --> 18:52.796
I stay home, hand out candy.

18:53.248 --> 18:55.166
And it must be your favorite
night of the year,

18:55.166 --> 18:59.848
these little girls, dressed in costume.

18:59.848 --> 19:03.432
Princesses, fairies...

19:03.432 --> 19:06.143
with sparkling wings,
ribbons in their hair...

19:06.143 --> 19:08.739
Your favorite night of the year.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.638
Why did you go out?

19:18.371 --> 19:20.147
I mean, you must have went out.

19:20.147 --> 19:23.113
You said that you were
with Amberleigh that night.

19:23.113 --> 19:25.479
That's right. / Do you remember
what she was dressed as?

19:25.479 --> 19:27.456
She was a little Genie.

19:27.456 --> 19:32.203
You remember everything
about Amberleigh, don't you?

19:33.567 --> 19:37.016
First day of school,
she wore a yellow dress,

19:37.016 --> 19:41.379
and little white ankle socks
with white shoes.

19:41.772 --> 19:43.580
You can see that, can't you?

19:43.580 --> 19:46.517
I mean, you can see it in your mind's eye,
the little yellow dress?

19:46.517 --> 19:49.451
Skipping at recess.

19:49.738 --> 19:51.855
So beautiful.

19:54.295 --> 19:59.124
Simon, you and Amberleigh
were never in that school together.

19:59.958 --> 20:03.186
Amberleigh was in Los Angeles
for the first two weeks of school,

20:03.186 --> 20:06.695
and you were fired
before she came back.

20:06.695 --> 20:08.857
She was in Los Angeles?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.857
- Then what about the sesame candy?
- I don't know.

20:11.857 --> 20:14.894
Maybe somebody told you.
Maybe you read it.

20:17.481 --> 20:22.190
It must have been Beth,
in one of her emails.

20:26.573 --> 20:29.504
Amberleigh's mother sent you an email?

20:30.579 --> 20:33.682
She made me promise not to tell anyone.

20:35.700 --> 20:40.136
No one knows, not Nate Royce,
not the DA.

20:44.933 --> 20:47.580
You won't tell anyone, will you?

20:56.804 --> 20:58.673
He may not have murdered Amberleigh,

20:58.673 --> 21:02.245
but I wouldn't let him within
a hundred miles of my nieces.

21:02.245 --> 21:03.517
Well, for what it's worth,

21:03.517 --> 21:06.038
Fife has agreed to enter
a monitored program.

21:06.038 --> 21:09.172
And the ADA says
we ruined her investigation,

21:09.172 --> 21:12.009
so now it's on us to solve.

21:12.933 --> 21:17.077
We have to ask Beth Harner
about these emails she sent to Fife.

21:17.077 --> 21:21.033
Not me. He's the one she was
making goo-goo eyes with.

21:21.748 --> 21:22.887
What's your take on her?

21:22.887 --> 21:25.299
Well, she's off, at times,
in her affect.

21:25.299 --> 21:27.718
You know, she smiles
when she's upset.

21:27.718 --> 21:28.880
She craves attention.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.917
You can see why people
made her as a suspect.

21:30.917 --> 21:32.318
A suspect without a motive.

21:32.318 --> 21:34.584
She was living through her daughter.

21:34.584 --> 21:39.459
If Amberleigh ever balked
at Beth's dream for her...

21:39.459 --> 21:42.013
You said she craves attention.
Give her some.

21:42.013 --> 21:44.935
You gained Fife's trust,
gain hers.

21:49.275 --> 21:53.496
¢Ü When me and my Alice
were playing the palace in '45 ¢Ü

21:53.496 --> 21:57.727
¢Ü there wasn't a word of they hadn't
heard of that thing called jive ¢Ü

21:57.727 --> 22:00.037
¢Ü when we did our dance
there was only one dance ¢Ü

22:00.037 --> 22:05.600
¢Ü the world, it was alive
we gave them the old soft shoe ¢Ü

22:24.381 --> 22:25.517
Coming!

22:28.156 --> 22:29.366
Wel...

22:32.171 --> 22:35.086
Oh, I wasn't expecting
the both of yous.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.388
Actually, I was just
dropping my partner off.

22:37.388 --> 22:39.763
Yeah, well, maybe next time.
Come in.

22:39.763 --> 22:42.074
Call me, if you need a ride home.

22:42.873 --> 22:44.165
Bye.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.316
I'm sorry you haven't had closure.

22:53.194 --> 22:56.447
But the case will remain open, right?

22:56.447 --> 22:57.919
Yeah, the case will stay open.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.251
No, I don't mean that. I mean...

23:00.251 --> 23:02.819
you'll be the one who calls me,
who tells me things,

23:02.819 --> 23:05.534
who keeps me updated?

23:06.201 --> 23:08.162
- Okay.
- Okay?

23:16.225 --> 23:20.458
You know, you seem like a man
who is dedicated to his work.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.879
Too much maybe.

23:23.907 --> 23:26.622
Like you were to Amberleigh.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.475
All right, I did it.

23:32.475 --> 23:34.168
I mean, I pushed her.

23:34.168 --> 23:37.545
But Amberleigh wanted to stop acting.

23:37.545 --> 23:40.296
A few months before she died,

23:40.296 --> 23:43.589
she told me that it wasn't
fun for her anymore.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.489
What? The auditions,
watching her weight?

23:45.489 --> 23:46.951
Yes.

23:48.223 --> 23:50.020
Halloween...

23:50.020 --> 23:52.659
how did, how did you
handle the candy?

23:52.659 --> 23:55.487
Amberleigh was allowed
to keep ten pieces

23:55.487 --> 24:00.116
and then she had to give the rest away.

24:00.352 --> 24:01.928
To her friends.

24:05.018 --> 24:09.899
The names of these kids that went
trick-or-treating with her, you remember them?

24:09.899 --> 24:12.387
Of course I remember.

24:16.557 --> 24:18.460
- Brianna.
- Okay.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.947
From down the street.
You know? She, oh,

24:20.947 --> 24:25.892
she worshipped Amberleigh.
She worshipped Amberleigh.

24:26.270 --> 24:29.400
And the Perlman twins.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.899
And Jamie, Nate's son.

24:33.899 --> 24:36.515
Nate Royce's son,
who lived next door?

24:36.515 --> 24:39.771
- He still does.
- Okay.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.091
Detective Goren...

24:49.847 --> 24:53.592
I've never told this to anyone before.

24:55.215 --> 25:00.462
The night that my baby was murdered,

25:01.920 --> 25:06.040
she wanted to eat
an extra piece of candy,

25:06.040 --> 25:09.002
just one more little piece of candy.

25:09.002 --> 25:11.019
And I wouldn't let her have it.

25:11.019 --> 25:13.928
She went to bed, she was crying.
She was angry with me.

25:13.928 --> 25:15.865
I didn't even kiss her good night.

25:15.865 --> 25:18.667
There's a book, okay?

25:18.667 --> 25:20.802
It's about grieving.

25:20.802 --> 25:23.264
And I'm sorry, but I can't
remember the name of it,

25:23.264 --> 25:27.605
but it could, it could help.
I could email it to you.

25:27.605 --> 25:29.426
Thank you.

25:30.527 --> 25:34.298
But I don't have, um, the internet.

25:34.298 --> 25:36.131
You don't have an email account?

25:36.131 --> 25:38.076
No.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.907
If someone wants to send me a sympathy
note or anything like that, you know,

25:42.907 --> 25:47.799
they, um, email it, or send it,
or whatever it's called,

25:47.799 --> 25:52.986
to Nate, and then Nate
brings it to me.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.425
Okay.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.485
Happy Halloween!

25:59.485 --> 26:02.698
Oh, what has you guys get tonight?

26:06.675 --> 26:08.652
Anything good?

26:08.966 --> 26:10.404
Stop, Amberleigh.
Stop tickling me.

26:10.404 --> 26:12.434
Tell us what your costumes are.

26:12.434 --> 26:13.662
I'm a Genie.

26:13.662 --> 26:15.010
And I'm a prince.

26:15.010 --> 26:17.911
Oh, a prince!
Isn't he handsome, Amberleigh?

26:17.911 --> 26:22.025
Isn't Jamie a handsome
prince Charming, huh?

26:22.417 --> 26:23.221
Yeah.

26:23.221 --> 26:25.924
So Beth told me she didn't email Fife

26:25.924 --> 26:27.995
about Amberleigh's stomach contents.

26:27.995 --> 26:31.667
And she didn't know about
Amberleigh's candy binge.

26:31.667 --> 26:34.161
I wonder if prince Jamie did.

26:43.982 --> 26:46.110
I was at Amberleigh's
for the candy swap,

26:46.110 --> 26:48.218
and then my parents took me home.

26:49.435 --> 26:53.269
What kind of candy did Amberleigh
get at the swap?

26:53.269 --> 26:54.996
Sesame logs.

26:54.996 --> 26:58.510
She got, like, 30 of them
'cause nobody else liked them.

26:59.489 --> 27:03.207
Halloween, the anniversary.
It must hard for you.

27:03.207 --> 27:06.230
Well, it's two anniversaries
for me, so, yeah, I guess.

27:06.230 --> 27:10.671
My mom died on Halloween too,
four years after, in a car wreck.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.006
She was drinking,

27:12.006 --> 27:13.683
but she didn't hurt anybody else.

27:13.683 --> 27:16.783
But that must have hurt you a lot.

27:18.236 --> 27:19.981
I'm, I'm okay.

27:19.981 --> 27:22.469
I gotta go.
I got a meeting.

27:22.469 --> 27:24.697
- Faculty?
- Teach?

27:24.697 --> 27:25.630
No.

27:25.630 --> 27:29.313
Uh, I'm still a student,
but this is a meeting, meeting.

27:30.091 --> 27:31.999
- AA?
- NA.

27:31.999 --> 27:34.542
Alcohol led to drugs.

27:35.176 --> 27:37.081
How long have you been sober?

27:37.081 --> 27:38.886
14 weeks.

27:38.886 --> 27:41.238
But I was addicted for 14 years.

27:41.238 --> 27:43.184
What step are you on?

27:43.184 --> 27:44.501
Fifth.

27:44.501 --> 27:46.153
Five...

27:46.363 --> 27:49.390
to admit the exact nature of your wrongs,

27:49.390 --> 27:51.961
to stop lying.

27:54.645 --> 27:57.243
Are you ready to do that?

28:03.653 --> 28:05.174
Yeah.

28:06.584 --> 28:08.533
Yeah, I am.

28:15.949 --> 28:17.434
Halloween night,

28:17.434 --> 28:19.638
Amberleigh looked so pretty,

28:19.638 --> 28:23.890
and she kept trying to tickle me.

28:23.890 --> 28:26.394
I misunderstood.

28:26.701 --> 28:30.015
That night, later, I couldn't sleep.

28:30.015 --> 28:32.146
I snuck into her house.

28:32.146 --> 28:36.246
I said we should go to the basement
and eat all our candy.

28:38.589 --> 28:41.475
Okay. You ate candy. Then?

28:42.507 --> 28:45.932
Um, I tried to kiss her,

28:45.932 --> 28:48.519
and she screamed.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.653
I tried to cover her mouth,

28:50.653 --> 28:53.706
but I hit her nose instead.

28:53.706 --> 28:55.667
She started to bleed.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.976
She was really crying.

28:58.674 --> 29:03.899
I pushed her face into the couch
to keep her quiet.

29:07.058 --> 29:08.648
I was so scared, you know?

29:08.648 --> 29:11.485
I didn't mean to kill her.

29:11.485 --> 29:14.301
Then you put her body in the dryer.

29:14.301 --> 29:16.144
No, I went home.

29:16.144 --> 29:20.630
And there was blood on my shirt.

29:20.630 --> 29:24.271
My mom told me to go to bed,
let her handle it.

29:24.271 --> 29:26.661
And I thought she was gonna
explain it to Beth.

29:26.661 --> 29:28.995
I waited at my window.

29:28.995 --> 29:33.611
Um, mom got in the car and drove off.

29:33.611 --> 29:36.268
She probably went
to make the ransom call.

29:36.268 --> 29:38.914
Why do you think she did that?

29:39.764 --> 29:43.628
I think she meant
to get rid of the body.

29:43.628 --> 29:47.655
She must've panicked
and hid Amberleigh in the dryer.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.825
I know you're gonna tell Beth.

29:55.697 --> 29:59.112
If she'll let me,
I'd like to speak to her.

30:00.519 --> 30:03.267
You care about Beth.

30:03.671 --> 30:09.532
Jamie, why did you email Simon Fife
pretending to be Beth?

30:12.675 --> 30:15.746
I don't remember doing that.

30:18.472 --> 30:22.675
But all those years of drug use,
you know, I have gaps.

30:22.675 --> 30:26.034
Um, they have meetings in jail, right?

30:26.320 --> 30:28.412
They do.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.615
Do you think your dad blames himself

30:34.615 --> 30:36.962
for what happened to you
after Amberleigh's murder?

30:36.962 --> 30:39.433
My dad didn't know about any of this.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.798
He was asleep.
We never told him.

30:41.798 --> 30:46.005
He thought that I lost it
'cause of my mom.

30:46.005 --> 30:49.639
Um, she was a bit of a self-medicator.

30:49.929 --> 30:52.325
I know the type.

30:57.044 --> 30:58.871
Another day, another confession.

30:58.871 --> 31:00.070
You buy it?

31:00.070 --> 31:02.472
Not the part about emailing Simon Fife.

31:02.472 --> 31:04.551
The question completely surprised him.

31:04.551 --> 31:06.845
Wouldn't be the first time
drugs addled memory.

31:06.845 --> 31:11.663
Well, except that these emails to Fife
were sent in the last three months,

31:11.663 --> 31:13.726
and Jamie's been sober that whole time.

31:13.726 --> 31:15.483
Well, if he didn't write them,
maybe his dad did.

31:15.483 --> 31:18.740
I don't see how a 12-year-old boy 
and a drunk mom

31:18.740 --> 31:20.807
could have kept a secret from Nate.

31:20.807 --> 31:22.129
Try to reach Beth.

31:22.129 --> 31:24.550
Maybe she'll meet with the kid.
He lied to us about a few things.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.619
I don't think he'll lie to her.

31:29.982 --> 31:31.664
I haven't been able to reach Beth.

31:31.664 --> 31:34.506
She might be having a bad day.
It's Halloween.

31:34.506 --> 31:35.656
Keep trying.

31:35.656 --> 31:38.284
In the meantime,
we should charge Jamie.

31:38.284 --> 31:41.265
He says he did it,
his mother covered.

31:41.265 --> 31:43.401
You don't believe a mother
would protect her 12-year-old boy?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.317
There's a piece missing.
Jamie's...

31:45.317 --> 31:46.589
maybe he's protecting his dad.

31:46.589 --> 31:49.220
It doesn't sound like
his dad protected him.

31:49.220 --> 31:53.003
Jamie has a case file in the Portland,
Oregon department of child services.

31:53.003 --> 31:56.782
He was living on the street
there when he was 16.

31:58.924 --> 32:02.458
The Royces let their son turn homeless.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.994
Well, his mom was probably
in her own world by then.

32:04.994 --> 32:07.518
Nate made a career
out of protecting Beth.

32:07.518 --> 32:09.385
Why wouldn't he get his son help?

32:09.385 --> 32:11.017
I don't know.

32:18.407 --> 32:20.768
No. He didn't want him to get help.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.274
I mean, that's, that's
the whole point, isn't it?

32:23.274 --> 32:26.415
Therapy is talk, right?

32:26.913 --> 32:30.254
A kid goes into therapy, he ends up
talking about Amberleigh's murder.

32:30.254 --> 32:32.762
When did Nate and Fife start emailing?

32:32.762 --> 32:33.571
Three months ago.

32:33.571 --> 32:37.983
Jamie told us that he was
sober for 14 weeks.

32:39.236 --> 32:41.808
You know, sobriety, that must
have been Nate's worst nightmare.

32:41.808 --> 32:44.953
'Cause when his kid is out of control,
he could control him.

32:44.953 --> 32:46.303
But if his kid's in a program...

32:46.303 --> 32:47.772
Nate was afraid his son would end up

32:47.772 --> 32:50.936
telling somebody what actually
happened that night.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.313
All right.

32:52.313 --> 32:56.146
Fife emailed Nate about
his obsession with Amberleigh.

32:56.146 --> 32:58.448
Nate reeled him in.

32:58.448 --> 33:00.739
Jamie's walking a fine line,

33:00.739 --> 33:04.224
confessing to his sins,
not his father's.

33:04.224 --> 33:06.347
Jamie won't turn on his father,

33:06.347 --> 33:09.844
but Nate, he's loyal to himself.

33:09.844 --> 33:13.632
Rich, can you find
Faith Yancy's producer?

33:13.632 --> 33:17.970
Tell them it's, uh, the DA's office.

33:19.307 --> 33:24.389
Nate Royce, your own son
has confessed to this crime.

33:24.389 --> 33:26.854
Did you ever, ever see this coming?

33:26.854 --> 33:28.622
I really shouldn't be showing you this.

33:28.622 --> 33:31.087
- Never in my wildest dreams, Faith.
- Thank you.

33:31.087 --> 33:35.025
Mr. Royce, I have some news
that may shock you.

33:35.025 --> 33:37.660
An anonymous source at the DA's office

33:37.660 --> 33:42.366
tells me that they believe your son
sent many emails to Simon Fife,

33:42.366 --> 33:44.588
pretending to be Beth Harner,

33:44.588 --> 33:48.328
giving him information
that only the killer would have.

33:48.328 --> 33:54.456
Faith, my wife Madeline
was a very sick woman,

33:54.456 --> 33:59.771
and I fear that she has
passed that on to my son.

34:02.122 --> 34:05.877
I was looking for him
in the holding cell.

34:06.964 --> 34:09.813
Detective Goren reached Beth.

34:10.039 --> 34:12.021
She's willing to meet you.

34:12.021 --> 34:13.599
Tonight.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.538
Tonight?

34:25.143 --> 34:27.206
It's all right, my baby.

34:28.514 --> 34:30.492
It's over.

34:31.619 --> 34:33.831
It's all over.

34:34.042 --> 34:36.090
Go to sleep now.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.617
I love you.

34:38.617 --> 34:41.302
Mama loves you.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.091
We all miss you, Amberleigh.

34:45.536 --> 34:47.697
Are you ready, hmm?

34:54.725 --> 34:57.497
How dare you come here, detective?

34:57.497 --> 34:59.141
Jamie wanted to pay his respects.

34:59.141 --> 35:02.382
No. No, Beth's had enough stress.

35:02.382 --> 35:04.822
No, it's all right, Nate.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.986
Come in, Jamie.

35:15.626 --> 35:17.315
Beth...

35:18.554 --> 35:20.981
I'm so sorry.

35:22.091 --> 35:24.894
You were a little boy, Jamie.

35:24.894 --> 35:26.849
I didn't mean to.

35:26.849 --> 35:28.487
It was an accident.

35:28.487 --> 35:31.590
I know. I know.

35:32.648 --> 35:34.906
Oh, you were so young.

35:34.906 --> 35:37.492
You were such a little boy.

35:41.785 --> 35:44.107
I forgive you.

35:45.682 --> 35:47.124
And so does Amberleigh.

35:47.124 --> 35:49.479
Now, come on. Come on.

36:00.472 --> 36:03.705
I wish I could take your place here.

36:08.239 --> 36:09.540
We'll drive you home, Beth.

36:09.540 --> 36:10.875
Oh, thank you.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.592
Yeah, I'd like to stay,

36:12.592 --> 36:15.467
and, and, and talk
everything over with Jamie.

36:15.467 --> 36:18.520
- No, Beth.
- It's okay, dad.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.618
I'm ready to take responsibility now.

36:20.618 --> 36:22.708
This isn't about making amends, Jamie.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.408
There are serious issues here.

36:24.408 --> 36:25.601
He already confessed, Nate.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.974
But you know that.

36:26.974 --> 36:29.787
Faith Yancy told you
all about it on national TV.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.419
Jamie and I watched.

36:32.786 --> 36:35.721
You need help, son.
That's why I went on TV,

36:35.721 --> 36:37.805
so that the public doesn't turn on you.

36:37.805 --> 36:39.637
Help. He needs help?

36:39.637 --> 36:42.020
He's getting help. He's sober.

36:42.218 --> 36:44.400
He needed help 14 years ago,

36:44.400 --> 36:45.944
the night Amberleigh died.

36:45.944 --> 36:48.728
I knew nothing about that.
My wife never told me.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.706
Even so, the drugs, the alcohol...

36:50.706 --> 36:53.173
you must have seen
your boy was in trouble.

36:53.173 --> 36:54.592
Madeline refused.

36:54.592 --> 36:59.033
I was worried about Jamie,
but she didn't care.

37:00.268 --> 37:02.087
Wait a minute, that's not true, Jamie.

37:02.087 --> 37:05.160
Your mother, your mother
cared so much about you.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.429
She was a drunk, Beth.

37:07.429 --> 37:10.570
Please. You know nothing about
my private struggles.

37:10.570 --> 37:11.756
But Jamie does.

37:11.756 --> 37:15.643
When you were in Portland, homeless,
you had a case worker.

37:15.643 --> 37:17.716
Wait a minute, you were, you were...

37:17.716 --> 37:20.304
you told me he was away at school.

37:20.304 --> 37:22.483
Your caseworker remembers you, Jamie.

37:22.483 --> 37:24.056
Do you know why?

37:24.056 --> 37:29.395
'Cause your dad called him
to request that you not get counseling.

37:29.395 --> 37:31.262
Dad, why would you?

37:31.262 --> 37:36.321
'cause he didn't want to risk you telling
your therapist your family secret.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.015
Isn't that right, Nate?

37:38.015 --> 37:40.456
When Jamie found sobriety,
you found Fife?

37:40.456 --> 37:43.778
You tricked him, didn't you,
into confessing?

37:43.778 --> 37:45.444
They're lying, Jamie.

37:45.444 --> 37:49.701
Fife had information about the murder
only the killer could've known.

37:50.262 --> 37:53.439
Fife thought that Beth was emailing him.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.033
Beth, you weren't emailing him,
were you?

37:56.266 --> 37:57.751
No.

37:57.751 --> 38:00.215
It was Jamie.
He, he doesn't remember.

38:00.215 --> 38:02.365
I didn't email him, dad.

38:02.365 --> 38:03.832
You know I love you.

38:03.832 --> 38:05.919
I have always protected you.

38:05.919 --> 38:07.586
Protected?

38:08.577 --> 38:10.708
The only one you protected
in all this was yourself.

38:10.708 --> 38:14.036
Your son could have gotten help,
but you told him he'd do hard time.

38:14.036 --> 38:15.865
Don't listen to them,
listen to me.

38:15.865 --> 38:17.574
Listen to you?

38:17.574 --> 38:19.726
You've been lying to me for 14 years.

38:19.726 --> 38:23.196
Madeline made the ransom call.

38:23.196 --> 38:26.631
Tell them, Jamie.
You came home, mom panicked.

38:26.631 --> 38:28.545
Tell them.

38:30.589 --> 38:33.154
Jamie, is that true?

38:33.340 --> 38:38.373
Jamie, Beth needs to know
what really happened.

38:42.235 --> 38:46.092
No. It wasn't mom's plan,
it was dad's.

38:46.092 --> 38:47.418
They had a big fight.

38:47.418 --> 38:51.454
I watched from the window
as mom got into the car and drove off.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.022
Dad went into the house.

38:54.796 --> 38:57.106
And I saw the light go on
in the basement,

38:57.106 --> 38:58.946
and he was down there for awhile.

38:58.946 --> 39:00.900
And then the cellar door opened,

39:00.900 --> 39:02.821
and lights went on upstairs.

39:02.821 --> 39:04.372
Did you turn the lights on, Beth?

39:04.372 --> 39:09.292
Yes, when I heard Amberleigh scream
from my bedroom window.

39:09.292 --> 39:11.134
Bedroom window, which is where?

39:11.134 --> 39:15.132
It's two floors
above the cellar door.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.328
She screamed, oh, my god,
did she scream.

39:22.266 --> 39:23.827
She was alive, Nate?

39:23.827 --> 39:25.055
No, no, no, no.

39:25.055 --> 39:27.090
She was gone, Beth.

39:27.090 --> 39:30.172
The screams were
from when Jamie was with her.

39:30.172 --> 39:32.887
So you were there.

39:32.887 --> 39:37.215
Jamie, do you remember what happened
after the lights went on?

39:37.215 --> 39:39.541
The cellar door closed,

39:39.541 --> 39:41.730
and a few minutes later,
dad came out the back door.

39:41.730 --> 39:42.939
He's got it wrong.

39:42.939 --> 39:47.855
This was his mother's idea
after Jamie killed Amberleigh.

39:47.855 --> 39:52.659
Jamie, you told me that you gave
Amberleigh a bloody nose.

39:54.201 --> 39:55.411
Did you hit her hard?

39:55.411 --> 39:58.570
No, I hit her nose by mistake,

39:58.570 --> 40:01.229
and she sat down and
started crying, and I...

40:01.229 --> 40:04.517
that's when I tried to stop the noise.

40:05.094 --> 40:07.971
And you suffocated her.

40:11.310 --> 40:13.537
But her head...

40:14.865 --> 40:17.580
her head didn't hit anything.

40:17.580 --> 40:20.186
Amberleigh's autopsy,
it's in your book. It's all there.

40:20.186 --> 40:21.916
She suffocated.

40:21.916 --> 40:27.286
And her brain had bruising,
front and back from head trauma.

40:27.286 --> 40:28.708
I didn't hit her head.

40:28.708 --> 40:30.566
All Jamie did was give her a bloody nose.

40:30.566 --> 40:32.009
He doesn't know what he did.

40:32.009 --> 40:33.908
No, but you do.

40:34.864 --> 40:36.527
Right?

40:36.527 --> 40:39.382
You saw Amberleigh in the basement.

40:39.785 --> 40:42.538
You thought she was dead,
just like Jamie did.

40:42.538 --> 40:46.891
You were gonna carry her body out,
and hide it.

40:48.755 --> 40:51.867
But something happened.

40:52.881 --> 40:54.374
What was it?

40:54.374 --> 40:56.527
Did she wake up?

40:56.744 --> 40:57.621
Did she?

40:57.621 --> 41:00.290
Nate, what did you, what did you do?

41:00.290 --> 41:02.231
She start crying?

41:02.231 --> 41:04.761
She start crying, Nate,
is that what happened?

41:04.761 --> 41:06.708
You heard Beth moving upstairs,

41:06.708 --> 41:09.133
and you panicked,
just like your son did?

41:09.133 --> 41:12.868
But Jamie ran for help from you.

41:14.361 --> 41:16.656
You smashed her head,

41:16.656 --> 41:20.353
and you threw her body into the dryer.

41:24.197 --> 41:27.457
Beth, Jamie didn't kill Amberleigh.

41:28.251 --> 41:33.810
- You did.
- I never meant...

41:34.112 --> 41:35.835
It was an accident,
and I swear that.

41:35.835 --> 41:37.552
It was an accident, huh?

41:37.552 --> 41:39.802
You sure you weren't just
trying to weigh your options?

41:39.802 --> 41:43.518
You know, her life, your reputation?

41:43.518 --> 41:45.268
And then you decided to finish her off.

41:45.268 --> 41:46.974
I was trying to protect my son.

41:46.974 --> 41:48.387
From what?

41:48.387 --> 41:51.322
You told me it was my fault,

41:51.322 --> 41:53.386
told me to act dumb.

41:53.386 --> 41:57.476
And that's what I did
for the next 14 years!

41:59.644 --> 42:02.172
How could you, Nate?

42:02.853 --> 42:04.769
How could you?

42:05.393 --> 42:06.869
Look at me.

42:08.292 --> 42:10.175
Nate, look at me.

42:10.354 --> 42:11.247
Look at me.

42:11.247 --> 42:12.777
All right, get him out of here.

42:12.777 --> 42:14.629
Look at me!

42:18.598 --> 42:21.306
You took everything.
