00:07.640 --> 00:09.851
[Chip] I came to Venice by accident.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.312
No, let me rephrase that.

00:13.396 --> 00:16.148
I came to Venice
because of an accident.

00:18.860 --> 00:21.070
Ten years ago, I killed a man.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.656
It was my fault.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.366
There's no excuse for it.

00:26.325 --> 00:30.455
You see, when it's left up to me,
my best thinking...

00:30.538 --> 00:33.291
my best thinking tells me
that it's okay to get loaded

00:33.374 --> 00:35.042
and get behind the wheel of a car.

00:36.127 --> 00:37.545
And that's what I did.

00:38.797 --> 00:41.173
I took another human being's life.

00:45.303 --> 00:48.431
And, in the process,
destroyed what was left of mine.

00:48.514 --> 00:51.935
But the people in these rooms,
you got me sober.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.686
You got me back on my feet,

00:55.146 --> 00:57.356
which is just as well,
as I walk everywhere now.

00:57.440 --> 01:01.110
The state of California no longer thinks
it's a good idea for me to drive.

01:01.193 --> 01:03.237
[scattered laughter]

01:03.362 --> 01:06.365
You taught me to be humble,
to be honest,

01:06.449 --> 01:09.911
brutally honest, about who I am
and what I'd done.

01:09.995 --> 01:12.747
You taught me
that if I really wanted to help myself,

01:12.831 --> 01:15.041
that I had to stick my hand out
and help others.

01:18.169 --> 01:20.212
[Dennis] It's a real tragedy.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.300
That kid Stefan was supposed
to bring the good coffee.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.639
Tragedy is an understatement.

01:32.224 --> 01:34.894
Is it Steven or Stefan?
It's Stefan, right?

01:34.978 --> 01:38.314
- Right.
- Yo, Stefan? You in here?

01:38.815 --> 01:39.691
Yeah, man.

01:39.774 --> 01:41.776
- It's Chip.
- And Dennis.

01:43.152 --> 01:44.570
- How's it going?
- Hey, man.

01:44.654 --> 01:46.823
It's going shit.
Look at this shit.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.909
These fucking assholes.
They act like I just moved here.

01:49.993 --> 01:52.662
I've been a Venice local since 2014.

01:54.039 --> 01:54.956
Great.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.501
They're fucking dinosaurs, man.

01:58.584 --> 02:01.295
You know, either you adapt
or you get left behind.

02:02.171 --> 02:03.715
Hey, are you okay, man?

02:03.798 --> 02:06.009
We didn't see you
in the rooms this morning.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.928
Yeah, you kind of bailed
on your coffee commitment.

02:09.012 --> 02:12.015
- We had to drink shit coffee.
- Yeah, because I've been here.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.725
I'm supposed to open today.

02:13.808 --> 02:15.560
I only got enough beans
for, like, two days.

02:15.643 --> 02:18.229
- Oh, so you do have coffee, then.
- Hey.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.439
Listen, Stefan,
that sounds really rough, man,

02:20.523 --> 02:22.650
but, you know, if you don't have time
to make it to a meeting,

02:22.734 --> 02:24.276
you can always come by the store.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.862
It's a great place to talk and listen...

02:25.945 --> 02:28.489
I had the plumber come in
and put my fucking sink in backwards.

02:28.573 --> 02:31.534
How do you not know that you're
putting in a fucking sink backwards?

02:31.617 --> 02:33.160
Yeah. Well, what is it they say,

02:33.244 --> 02:38.583
that life must be lived forward
but can only be understood backwards?

02:38.666 --> 02:41.586
I find that when I do the work...

02:41.669 --> 02:44.171
Not today, man, okay?
Some of us have real work to do.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.304
So, no coffee, then?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074

03:27.173 --> 03:29.383
- What are we doing here?
- Just a little business.

03:29.467 --> 03:32.011
- You're going to do wine business now?
- They got a new waitress.

03:32.095 --> 03:33.596
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

03:33.679 --> 03:36.099
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, but I saw her first.

03:36.182 --> 03:37.683
All right.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.270
She must not be working.

03:41.353 --> 03:43.272
Man, why don't we just catch her
at shift change?

03:43.355 --> 03:46.067
Yeah. Do you ever get the feeling
like this is the one?

03:46.151 --> 03:49.361
- All the time.
- Yeah, me too, but this girl...

03:49.445 --> 03:52.615
- It's just that words can't describe her.
- Oh, yeah?

03:52.698 --> 03:54.700
- Let me take a look.
- Come on, I'll give it a shot.

03:54.784 --> 03:55.827
Her name is London.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.454
[Chip] London? I think I've been there.

03:58.537 --> 04:01.666
[Dennis] No, man. She's new to Venice.

04:01.749 --> 04:04.085
[Chip] I wish my name was a place.

04:04.169 --> 04:06.921
[Dennis] Forgive me if I indulge
in a little poetry here,

04:07.005 --> 04:08.965
but she has the sickest body.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.341
Dude, I love that book.

04:10.424 --> 04:14.470
When I first saw her,
I got, like, this electric shock.

04:14.553 --> 04:15.847
You mean you bolted?

04:15.930 --> 04:17.389
[laughs]

04:17.473 --> 04:19.976
But no, I did get out of there
as fast as I could.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.228
- It was just... it was too intense, man.
- Yeah.

04:22.311 --> 04:25.606
You know? She's got, like, this...
this depth of presence.

04:25.690 --> 04:28.734
You know what it is?
It's like when I look into a mirror,

04:28.818 --> 04:32.571
but on the other side,
it's like this insanely beautiful woman.

04:32.655 --> 04:35.200
Wait up. That sounds like a window.

04:35.282 --> 04:37.202
No, no... but it's a mirror.

04:37.284 --> 04:39.120
Because she's, like,
the perfect reflection of me.

04:39.204 --> 04:41.413
Yeah, I'm sorry, dude, but if she's
the perfect reflection of you,

04:41.497 --> 04:44.167
doesn't that make her
fifteen years too old for you?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.335
All right.
Hey, hey, hey! I'm sorry.

04:46.418 --> 04:48.671
Sorry about that.
They're very friendly.

04:48.754 --> 04:51.590
Yeah, I think he... picked up on that.

04:51.674 --> 04:53.300
Isn't he supposed to have a muzzle?

04:53.384 --> 04:57.388
Yeah, he is, but he didn't like it.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.182
Oh, he didn't? Oh, okay.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.432
[chuckles]

05:00.516 --> 05:04.520
No, look, the whole thing is, man,
I just... I just don't want you to swoop.

05:04.603 --> 05:08.357
- You know?
- Dude, when did I ever swoop?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.151
- Kara.
- Hey.

05:10.235 --> 05:12.153
Dude, I didn't even know
you were into her.

05:12.237 --> 05:13.487
Yeah. What? How...

05:13.571 --> 05:15.990
Then how do you explain
my sudden interest in indie music?

05:16.074 --> 05:18.325
No, I know now that you're
in your preliminary research phase.

05:18.409 --> 05:20.369
She played rhythm trombone
for an indie rock band.

05:20.452 --> 05:23.539
- I didn't know it at the time.
- Look, I just... I'm cool, all right?

05:23.622 --> 05:26.084
Initially, there was, like,
this residual sense of betrayal,

05:26.167 --> 05:30.337
but now that I know you're serious,
you know, it kind of softens the blow.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.218
I don't know if I'd categorize
me and Kara as "serious" per se...

05:35.301 --> 05:38.679
No? I thought I heard
she came over last night.

05:38.763 --> 05:41.390
- Who told you that?
- Nobody told me that. I heard you.

05:41.473 --> 05:44.643
I sleep, like, ten yards away.
How many times is that now?

05:44.727 --> 05:46.896
It's been a few, right?

05:46.979 --> 05:48.773
I don't know.
Maybe, like, six or seven.

05:48.856 --> 05:50.733
Definitely less than eight.

05:50.816 --> 05:53.778
So, I'm not... not yet past
the cut-off point.

05:53.903 --> 05:56.948
You mean the point at which
you cut her off?

05:57.031 --> 05:59.951
No. The point at which
a series of casual hook-ups

06:00.034 --> 06:01.410
turns into a relationship.

06:01.493 --> 06:02.494
Let me get this straight.

06:02.578 --> 06:05.206
So, you were willing to jeopardize
our friendship for this girl

06:05.290 --> 06:06.749
and you're not even serious about her?

06:06.832 --> 06:10.920
No, man, I am serious about her.
That's why we're not in a relationship.

06:11.003 --> 06:11.963
Oh.

06:13.839 --> 06:16.425
Wait. That doesn't make any sense.

06:17.509 --> 06:20.263
She's in her first year, man.

06:20.346 --> 06:24.183
It's not good for her sobriety
to be in a relationship.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.228
Plus, come on,

06:27.312 --> 06:30.982
you know that I'd never do anything
to jeopardize our friendship.

06:34.401 --> 06:35.569
[machine beeps]

06:35.653 --> 06:38.447
Hey, Chip. This is Jerry.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.909
- Fucking Jerry.
- Fucking, Jerry, man.

06:43.328 --> 06:46.038
I was wondering, are you going
to be at the store tomorrow?

06:46.122 --> 06:47.623
How do I know if I'm going
to be at the store tomorrow?

06:47.706 --> 06:48.916
Did the beep go?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.085
When did he even leave
the fucking message?

06:51.169 --> 06:52.711
- Today. It could be tomorrow.
- Yeah.

06:52.795 --> 06:56.925
We need to have
a landlord/tenant type conversation.

06:57.009 --> 06:59.386
- Cool. Oh, it's J...
- [machine beeps]

07:01.347 --> 07:03.015
I wonder what he wants. He never calls.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.936
Hey, do you mind
watching the store for me?

07:12.774 --> 07:14.818
[moaning]

07:18.238 --> 07:19.781
[Chip] Oh, God.

07:25.787 --> 07:26.913
Kara...

07:34.087 --> 07:35.339
Oh, oh, my God.

07:35.422 --> 07:38.466
You're not going to... get that...

07:59.738 --> 08:00.947
[sighs]

08:05.744 --> 08:09.289
- This is why I don't have a cell phone.
- Because you're old.

08:09.373 --> 08:14.086
No. Because I don't want to spend all day
staring at a stupid screen.

08:14.169 --> 08:16.296
So what? You'd rather stare at my ass?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.674
As a matter of fact, I would.

08:20.884 --> 08:26.473
What? Fuck! They just kicked us
out of the rehearsal space.

08:26.556 --> 08:29.601
Oh, man. That's...

08:29.684 --> 08:33.438
- That is too bad.
- "Too bad"? It fucking sucks.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.522
[sighs]

08:36.357 --> 08:37.234
No.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.779
Come on. More bad news
on the "bad news machine"?

08:40.861 --> 08:44.241
This stylist who's big on Instagram,
he's, like... wants to cut my hair short.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.575
He's obsessed.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.786
Yeah, I could see that.

08:47.869 --> 08:49.996
I think you'd look really good
with short hair.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.917
You have such a pretty face.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.339
I'm going to go take a shower.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.521
You know, if you want, you could always
use my store to rehearse.

09:16.273 --> 09:18.608
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.068
Oh, my God. That'd be dope.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.556
- Hey, is Stefan around?
- Oh, hey, Chip.

09:49.639 --> 09:53.393
Hey! Hi! Well...

09:53.477 --> 09:55.895
- You work here.
- It's Natasha.

09:55.979 --> 09:59.149
Yeah, Natasha. How are... You know what?
Can I get a regular coffee to go?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.900
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

10:00.984 --> 10:05.697
So, how's Kara doing?
I hear you guys are almost serious now.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.868
You're Kara's friend.
Yeah. Well, we are almost serious.

10:09.951 --> 10:12.912
Yeah. Hey, listen.
So, is Stefan around?

10:12.996 --> 10:16.249
Oh, he just left.
He had to go to a meeting.

10:16.333 --> 10:19.461
Oh, yeah? Oh, good.
Okay. Well, I guess...

10:19.545 --> 10:21.338
It's good he heard me.

10:21.421 --> 10:25.133
I don't know if you saw this morning,
but we kind of tangled a little bit.

10:25.217 --> 10:27.344
I hate having to play
the bad cop, you know?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.179
I didn't see.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.390
Oh, okay.

10:33.058 --> 10:34.767
- Well, that is good.
- Right?

10:34.851 --> 10:37.354
- Yeah.
- I know. Free Coffee is the best.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.272
Oh, yeah?

10:39.356 --> 10:42.484
Well, no argument here.
Thank you, Natasha.

10:42.568 --> 10:45.487
You're welcome. It'll be $4.50.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.700
Oh, I thought you said
that it was... free.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.370
That's the name. "Free Coffee."

10:53.453 --> 10:56.373
As in, free of all, like, the bad stuff.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.419
Oh, right. Okay. Well...

11:00.502 --> 11:04.881
I'll let it slide today, but next time
you've got to hit me up, okay? Make sure.

11:18.604 --> 11:20.105
[in Spanish]
On the house, Chip!

11:20.188 --> 11:21.273
Gracias, Miguel.

11:43.962 --> 11:46.506
[Dennis] So, hey,
did you talk to Jerry yet?

11:46.590 --> 11:49.092
I'm on it. Yeah, straight after lunch.

11:49.175 --> 11:53.555
Just... taking care of the...
Stefan situation.

11:53.639 --> 11:56.015
I didn't know
there was a Stefan situation.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.850
Oh, come on, man.
You were there this morning.

11:58.893 --> 12:02.855
The guy's obviously got anger issues.
Lash out at me like that?

12:02.939 --> 12:05.191
Well, I wouldn't say
that he lashed out at you.

12:05.275 --> 12:07.819
Well, anyway, he went to a meeting,
you know? The guy...

12:07.902 --> 12:08.778
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:08.903 --> 12:12.824
So, you know, he heard me,
just not in the moment.

12:12.907 --> 12:15.452
Guess he had to let it... percolate.

12:15.535 --> 12:21.166
Yeah. So, good. So, it's great.
So, you're done. Yeah. Case closed.

12:29.174 --> 12:30.175
Frida Kahlo.

12:31.510 --> 12:34.262
Yeah, yeah.
London's a big fan.

12:34.346 --> 12:36.473
- Is she?
- Mm-hmm.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.143
Good. So, we're now officially
in the preliminary research phase.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.894
Also, I didn't realize
that you spoke to her.

12:44.439 --> 12:45.815
Did you speak to her?

12:47.734 --> 12:50.278
Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:50.362 --> 12:51.697
Well, I mean, technically no,
but I was...

12:51.738 --> 12:55.325
I was there this morning
when she was speaking to her manager.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.327
That was, you know,
just to kind of do the wine list.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.496
- I was there to sort that out.
- Sure you were.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.582
She went to a costume party,
dressed as Frida Kahlo,

13:02.666 --> 13:05.168
and she got her leg, like,
caught in the spokes of a bike

13:05.251 --> 13:06.252
and she hurt her leg.

13:06.336 --> 13:09.715
"I tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol,
but the bastards learned how to swim."

13:09.797 --> 13:13.552
And the weird thing is,
what's ironic is the real Frida Kahlo,

13:13.635 --> 13:16.471
she hurt her leg
and it impacted her entire life.

13:18.348 --> 13:21.851
Huh. That is ironic.
I don't think I knew that.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.980
You know, maybe I did.
Yes, I did. Yeah. Of course.

13:26.064 --> 13:28.775
- That was her... hurt a limb.
- It was her leg.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.985
"Feet, what do I need you for
when I have wings to fly?"

13:31.069 --> 13:32.111
All right, man.

13:32.195 --> 13:34.072
Sounds like you've got
all the ammo you need.

13:34.155 --> 13:35.448
Yeah, well, I wouldn't say that.

13:35.532 --> 13:37.825
I just don't want to be the guy
that's read the first chapter

13:37.909 --> 13:39.118
of a thousand-page biography.

13:39.202 --> 13:41.747
- No, that's a shitty look.
- I want to do it right.

13:41.829 --> 13:43.956
Or do it... right?

13:57.262 --> 13:59.723
It's a "walk street," asshole!

13:59.806 --> 14:01.015
Fuck it.

14:01.099 --> 14:02.809
[male officer] Halt!

14:05.061 --> 14:07.731
Exit your vehicle... slowly.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.857
- Yeah, I can't exit...
- Show me your hands.

14:09.941 --> 14:11.109
Hands.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.446
Now, let me your ass.

14:14.529 --> 14:17.115
Come on. I don't have time for this.

14:18.784 --> 14:20.952
What the fuck you gotta do?

14:22.328 --> 14:24.038
Come on, George,
I'm in the middle of something.

14:26.249 --> 14:28.585
- Fine. You know that kid, Stefan?
- Yeah, I know Stefan.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.962
- The kid needs his ass kicked.
- Yeah, exactly.

14:31.045 --> 14:33.590
He's not working the program,
dropped a couple commitments.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.759
- So what?
- What "what"?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.594
Look, I can tell there's a "what."
What is it?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.345
No. It's nothing. I just...

14:39.429 --> 14:42.056
I actually heard he's been going around
lashing out at people, that's all.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.100
What's he saying about you?

14:46.311 --> 14:50.315
Me? No. Nothing. I mean, he...
Since you brought it up, he did...

14:50.398 --> 14:52.942
He was weird with me this morning,
but that's not... I'm fine with it. No.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.069
Oh, so you're doing damage control.

14:55.153 --> 14:57.614
I'm sorry. Why do you get
to take my inventory?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.491
Last I checked,
you're not my sponsor anymore.

14:59.574 --> 15:01.409
Look, just keep
your side of the road clean.

15:02.619 --> 15:04.120
Don't worry, it is.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.455
I gotta go, man.

15:07.457 --> 15:09.626
Show us some nipple.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.295
Come on, man. Just a little nipple.

15:21.971 --> 15:24.891
Chip, Chip, Chip! Cooler!
Come inside.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.519
Come on in. But be cool.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.151
What is it, man?

15:35.234 --> 15:37.570
Bro, bro... you've got to see
the new waitress in here, man.

15:37.654 --> 15:39.698
She is a smoke show.

15:39.781 --> 15:42.116
- Ooh! Watch her walk!
- Dude, I don't have time for this.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.328
Seriously, man. For real.
She is, like, my idea of the perfect wife.

15:45.411 --> 15:50.208
We would be so happy together
for, like, 15 years.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.585
Wait, I'm sorry. Even your idea
of the perfect fantasy wife

15:52.669 --> 15:53.753
ends in divorce?

15:53.837 --> 15:57.507
Yeah. Yeah, for sure,
but it would be amicable.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.634
Wait. So, what has gotten you
out of bed this time of day?

15:59.718 --> 16:03.054
This, man. I had to wake up early
and run a bunch of those off.

16:03.137 --> 16:05.682
I dropped a shitload off
at your store for your custees.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.517
God, you're still trying
to do this shit, huh?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.769
Yeah, man!
Tons of chicks go to these shows.

16:09.853 --> 16:11.062
- Do they?
- Yeah.

16:11.145 --> 16:13.231
And you know what they say.
"If you can make a girl laugh,

16:13.314 --> 16:15.274
you can make a girl go to bed with you."

16:15.358 --> 16:17.861
Or, in your case,
if you can make a girl go to bed with you,

16:17.944 --> 16:19.529
then you can make her laugh.

16:20.530 --> 16:23.408
You guys okay over... here?

16:24.784 --> 16:26.494
Yeah, I'm good.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.540
This is London.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.793
Good.

16:34.711 --> 16:36.295
We're good.

16:36.379 --> 16:38.172
- Good.
- Good.

16:38.256 --> 16:39.257
[Cooler] Good.

16:40.091 --> 16:42.176
- I'm going to take off.
- How's your leg?

16:42.260 --> 16:44.512
- What?
- Um...

16:44.596 --> 16:46.556
- It's okay. Thanks.
- Cool.

16:46.639 --> 16:50.017
She... she was at a costume party
and snatched her leg up,

16:50.101 --> 16:52.562
but it's... better.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.980
It was a fun night, though.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.524
Yeah, well, not for me, but...

16:57.442 --> 16:59.736
Of... yeah, right.
Not for you. You hurt yourself.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.028
So, uh-huh.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.575
Oh, who was that lady
that you went dressed as,

17:05.657 --> 17:08.243
with the big brow face with the bun?

17:08.327 --> 17:09.621
Frida Kahlo.

17:09.704 --> 17:11.830
- Yeah.
- That's ironic.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.420
Oh, right, 'cause she...
yeah, she hurt her leg as well.

17:19.923 --> 17:20.757
Yeah.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.928
Is it hard for you to work, like,
on your feet all the time, because...?

17:25.011 --> 17:27.680
Nope. Yeah, I manage.

17:27.763 --> 17:30.934
"Feet, what do I need you for
when I have wings...

17:32.727 --> 17:34.854
wings to fly?"

17:39.025 --> 17:40.568
He doesn't know anything.

17:40.819 --> 17:43.070
It's a Frida Kahlo quote, right?

17:47.993 --> 17:48.868
[Cooler] Cool.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.289
- What was that?
- Nothing.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.167
That was nothing? She had electric shocks
just from looking at you.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.921
- Look, man, I really have to go.
- Dude, where do you know stuff like that?

18:00.005 --> 18:01.840
Oh, come on.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.343
Hey, man.

18:48.511 --> 18:49.721
What's up?

18:50.471 --> 18:52.765
- Jarek, right?
- Hey, thanks for doing this.

18:52.849 --> 18:54.100
Yeah, sure. Happy to do it,

18:54.183 --> 18:56.519
just for the love of the music
and the look on their faces.

18:59.647 --> 19:02.025
We're going to be making
a lot of noise, so...

19:02.108 --> 19:04.402
Oh, that's okay.
I've got to go play paddle, anyway,

19:04.527 --> 19:05.611
so I won't be here.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.696
All right.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.032
But we can hang later if you want.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.577
I actually need an excuse to go
to this stand-up show.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.286
I don't really like comedy.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.788
Well, then you'll love this.

19:16.748 --> 19:19.291
- You know, I've got shit to do.
- Come on.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.293
It'd be fun to hang, outside a meeting,

19:21.377 --> 19:24.756
you know, with our clothes on,
not that I'm ruling that out.

19:24.839 --> 19:26.549
So, like, a date?

19:27.258 --> 19:28.885
Well...

19:28.968 --> 19:30.720
Because if it's a date, I'm out.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.099
No, it's definitely not a date.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.602
So, do I need a key or anything
to lock up, in case you're not back?

19:37.685 --> 19:39.437
No. Just push the button
on the side of the door here

19:39.520 --> 19:41.230
and, Bob's your uncle.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.691
"Bob's my uncle"? What's...?

19:44.483 --> 19:45.568
No, it's a...

19:46.318 --> 19:47.737
You've never...?

19:48.905 --> 19:50.782
Okay.

19:50.865 --> 19:52.992
- Just pull the door shut.
- Yeah.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.164
Let's go to Main Street.

19:58.247 --> 19:59.999
What? Main Street?
We're going to go play paddle, man.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.252
Yeah, but if we take Main Street,
we'll run into London. It's shift change.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.254
No, dude. Shift change?
No, come on. Let's...

20:05.337 --> 20:07.339
We're going to go play paddle.
It's a straight shot this way.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.717
Hey, shift change.
That's our best chance.

20:09.801 --> 20:11.677
We'll catch her coming or going.
You taught me that.

20:11.761 --> 20:13.972
No, I know, but I think
I'd just rather just play paddle, man.

20:14.055 --> 20:17.391
- Yeah, it's a better vibe down...
- West side! Represent!

20:17.475 --> 20:18.935
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.519
What are you guys doing
for shift change?

20:20.603 --> 20:22.730
Shift change?
No, we're not doing shift change.

20:22.814 --> 20:23.856
We're going to play paddle, man.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.525
Plus, listen, you can't make
a good first impression if...

20:27.359 --> 20:30.113
- No offense, man.
- Oh, I respectfully disagree, Chip.

20:30.196 --> 20:33.032
I make everyone look a little better.
Who we talking about?

20:33.116 --> 20:36.202
Oh, no. Just this new chick, London.

20:36.285 --> 20:37.662
- From GJ?
- Yeah.

20:37.745 --> 20:40.999
Yeah! Did Chip tell you
we saw her yesterday?

20:41.082 --> 20:42.667
No, he didn't.
He failed to mention that.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.460
Did I?

20:44.543 --> 20:46.712
He also failed to mention
that he went to GJ.

20:46.796 --> 20:49.048
Yeah, well, I mean,
I guess technically...

20:49.132 --> 20:51.218
I didn't go there for any,
like, specific...

20:51.301 --> 20:54.387
- Dude, he gave her an electric shock.
- Cooler, come on, man.

20:54.471 --> 20:56.723
- Wow. That's sweet.
- No, I mean, it was like...

20:57.307 --> 20:59.726
[mimics electrocution]
She shook.

20:59.852 --> 21:01.728
Hi. That's... her.

21:01.812 --> 21:02.938
Oh, hey.

21:04.272 --> 21:06.233
- Hello, again.
- Hey.

21:06.316 --> 21:07.860
- London, right?
- Yeah.

21:08.861 --> 21:09.862
I'm Chip.

21:10.988 --> 21:13.824
- This is Dennis.
- Yeah, well, she knows.

21:13.907 --> 21:15.242
I supply the wine at the restaurant.

21:15.325 --> 21:18.787
Oh! Okay. Well, I'm on my way there now,
actually, to start a shift, so...

21:18.871 --> 21:20.413
- A work shift?
- Right now?

21:20.497 --> 21:22.708
Okay, well, we're going to go
play paddle tennis, so we'll...

21:22.791 --> 21:24.918
We should get going, man.
Let's get down there. Let's do it.

21:25.002 --> 21:27.046
Hey, I see that the leg's all better.

21:27.129 --> 21:30.174
- Yeah, it is. Thank you.
- It's kind of ironic though, huh?

21:30.257 --> 21:31.299
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:31.383 --> 21:34.594
That you went to a costume party
as Frida Kahlo.

21:34.678 --> 21:38.765
- Because I hurt my leg?
- Yeah. What is it that she always said?

21:38.849 --> 21:41.727
"Feet, what do I need you for
when I have wings to fly?"

21:43.020 --> 21:44.604
- Chip, didn't you say the same thing?
- Cooler...

21:47.107 --> 21:49.317
You guys read the same book
on Frida Kahlo or something?

21:50.777 --> 21:51.653
Uh...

21:51.737 --> 21:55.908
Did we? No. I read the book.
I told Chip about it.

21:55.991 --> 21:58.493
Reminded me if...

21:59.161 --> 22:01.121
Okay. Well, have a good game.

22:01.914 --> 22:03.623
We will.

22:03.707 --> 22:05.500
Yeah, we will.

22:08.295 --> 22:10.505
You guys are real cool
dum-dums, man.

22:33.153 --> 22:34.738
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

22:38.909 --> 22:42.871
Still pissed at me, huh?
I'd be pissed at me, too.

22:42.955 --> 22:44.998
Honestly, I... I get it.

22:45.082 --> 22:47.960
I only went in there to see Cooler
'cause he said it was urgent,

22:48.043 --> 22:50.587
and she was there, and then I...

22:50.670 --> 22:52.298
and then I just, I heard this voice.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.550
It was like, "Oh, you've got
these feet that you're got..."

22:55.634 --> 22:59.263
And I was like, "Oh, wait.
I recognize that voice. It's mine."

23:00.055 --> 23:01.056
It was awful.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.017
She had a sick body
and a depth of presence

23:04.101 --> 23:08.230
and these eyes that were like,
"I know you, but you'll never know me."

23:08.314 --> 23:09.481
So, you do like her?

23:09.564 --> 23:11.275
No, man. Are you not listening
to what I'm saying?

23:11.358 --> 23:13.401
Oh, no, I'm listening.
It sounds like you like her.

23:13.485 --> 23:16.696
Dude, I don't like her! God!

23:18.907 --> 23:20.492
Unless, of course, you don't either,

23:20.575 --> 23:22.661
in which case I want to know
the statute of limitations.

23:28.292 --> 23:29.542
Out.

23:38.260 --> 23:41.930
Hey, man, I did you a favor!
I saved you four weeks!

23:42.014 --> 23:44.099
What? How's that?

23:44.183 --> 23:47.477
Because that's how long
it would have taken you

23:47.560 --> 23:50.147
to read that book,
and then talk to her,

23:50.230 --> 23:53.066
and then casually drop in the line
about Frida Kahlo.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.318
I introduced you.

23:54.401 --> 23:57.154
Yeah, man, you introduced me.
What does that make me?

23:57.237 --> 24:00.573
That makes you a month
ahead of schedule, man.

24:00.657 --> 24:02.617
Who knows what would have
happened in that month?

24:02.701 --> 24:05.453
Cooler might have got in there.

24:05.537 --> 24:09.582
Obviously not Cooler,
but you get the point.

24:11.335 --> 24:13.670
The point is,
you made me look ridiculous!

24:17.590 --> 24:19.718
I know, man. I'm sorry.

24:22.388 --> 24:23.930
I really am.

24:27.184 --> 24:31.604
But it was definitely you, though,
who she said hello to. Definitely.

24:31.855 --> 24:34.649
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

24:36.193 --> 24:39.821
You know, I thought so,
but then, there was just a lot going on.

24:39.905 --> 24:41.156
I couldn't be sure.

24:43.116 --> 24:45.327
So, you're definitely not into her?

24:45.411 --> 24:49.539
No, man. I told you.
I'm serious about Kara. I'm just...

24:49.622 --> 24:52.792
After tonight, I'm going to be
way past the cut-off point.

25:04.679 --> 25:05.972
Good for you, man.

25:13.063 --> 25:15.315
She forgot to lock the...

25:19.819 --> 25:20.862
Whoa.

25:20.946 --> 25:25.533
Stefan, I thought I'd see you today.
Come on, clinic's open.

25:26.118 --> 25:29.704
- I don't really have time for this, man.
- Come on in, man. Spill the beans.

25:29.788 --> 25:31.498
- Chip, I...
- Get in here, dude.

25:35.294 --> 25:39.631
Look, it's cool. I know that you've got
a lot to worry about right now.

25:40.924 --> 25:45.137
But the one thing you can't worry about
is what other people think about you.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.014
- Wait. What are people saying about me?
- You can't control that.

25:51.684 --> 25:55.730
Yesterday, you were freaking out
about your coffee supplier, the plumber...

25:55.814 --> 25:57.399
No, that guy fucking bailed on me, man.

25:57.483 --> 26:01.236
Yeah, and you fucking bailed
on your commitments.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.696
What makes your transgression
better than theirs?

26:08.118 --> 26:10.912
Every time you point
your finger at someone,

26:10.996 --> 26:13.457
you've got three more
pointing right back at you.

26:16.668 --> 26:19.712
- What about the thumb, though?
- The thumb's not a finger.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.175
I'm sorry you had to see me
freak out like that.

26:23.258 --> 26:25.969
It's okay. It's not about me.

26:29.139 --> 26:30.682
Oh, man.

26:30.765 --> 26:32.767
- Hey, Chip.
- Hey.

26:34.102 --> 26:35.770
All right, man. Be good.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.569
- [Dennis] Another satisfied customer?
- [laughs]

26:43.362 --> 26:45.405
I got you some Kombucha.

26:45.489 --> 26:48.325
- Oh, great. Yeah.
- Man, I thought you liked this shit.

26:48.408 --> 26:50.410
- No, I do. It's super good for you, man.
- Yeah.

26:50.494 --> 26:51.995
[shuffling]

26:52.078 --> 26:55.415
- Is somebody back there?
- I don't know. Maybe Kara?

27:06.343 --> 27:07.219
Fuck.

27:20.732 --> 27:24.277
Oh! What the fuck? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

27:24.361 --> 27:25.945
Nice and slow, man.
Nice and slow.

27:26.738 --> 27:29.616
I'm Granger, the appraiser.

27:30.576 --> 27:31.826
Jerry gave me keys.

27:32.827 --> 27:34.829
Fucking Jerry.

27:36.081 --> 27:38.041
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to freak you two out.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.545
Oh, that's okay.
You didn't freak me out.

27:41.628 --> 27:45.549
- So, why'd Jerry give you a key?
- To do the appraisal.

27:45.632 --> 27:47.675
- Appraisal of what?
- Of the building.

27:47.759 --> 27:50.011
- Of this building?
- Yeah.

27:50.095 --> 27:53.432
Jerry asked you to do
an appraisal of this building?

27:53.515 --> 27:56.560
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I should have made that more clear.

27:56.809 --> 28:00.272
Did he not mention that to you?

28:00.355 --> 28:03.191
So, the studio apartment is up there?

28:03.275 --> 28:05.360
Yeah, yeah, it's just up there, and...

28:05.444 --> 28:06.403
Okay.

28:07.404 --> 28:09.197
Let me know if you need anything.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.199
Yeah.

28:11.283 --> 28:15.995
Hey, man. You've got to go see Jerry.
You've got to figure this shit out.

28:16.079 --> 28:19.458
Why? It's probably nothing.

28:25.464 --> 28:27.257
So, I'll see you later
at Cooler's show, yeah?

28:27.340 --> 28:29.050
Yeah.

28:43.982 --> 28:48.361
Hey! Okay. Thank you,
everybody here in Venice.

28:48.445 --> 28:50.071
It's my home, too, you guys.

29:13.303 --> 29:17.182
One person. You know what I mean?
Where are you guys?

29:17.265 --> 29:18.850
You're a fake. You're a phony.

29:18.933 --> 29:21.394
You live in Mar Vista.
You don't live in Venice.

29:21.478 --> 29:24.856
You can't claim to be a local
if you don't live here.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.736
- This is a walk street, asshole!
- Sorry, man.

29:30.778 --> 29:32.739
It's okay.

30:38.888 --> 30:40.306
Dennis!
