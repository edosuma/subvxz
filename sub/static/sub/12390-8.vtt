08:55.500 --> 08:56.922
HE'S USING HEROIN.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.369
WHATEVER IT IS,
ANYTHING THAT PAYS

08:58.400 --> 08:59.560
IN STACKS OF CASH
LIKE THAT

08:59.600 --> 09:00.567
CAN'T BE LEGAL...

09:00.600 --> 09:01.760
OR HEALTHY.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.960
IT'S OBVIOUS
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.399
MALONE WAS INVOLVED
IN SOME SHADY DEALINGS.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.078
HE'S EITHER OFF
ON A SPENDING SPREE,

09:07.110 --> 09:08.998
OR THINGS GOT A LITTLE
TOO SHADY FOR HIM.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.348
SO, WHAT NOW?

09:10.380 --> 09:11.404
FIND HIS FRIENDS.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.678
COMPUTER CAMP? PLEASE.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.744
MALONE'S ROLLING IN DOUGH.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.017
WE FIND THEM,

09:16.050 --> 09:17.347
WE FIND HIM.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.641
THE QUESTION IS,
WHERE?

09:18.690 --> 09:20.988
WAIT A SECOND.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.124
YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.127
GUS, I'M A PROFESSIONAL

09:24.160 --> 09:25.127
AT GATHERING
INFORMATION, OKAY?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.127
I'M GETTING THERE.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.229
[CH UCKLES]

09:27.260 --> 09:28.557
YOU KNOW, SHAWN, I...

09:28.600 --> 09:30.465
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE
A LITTLE BETTER THAN THIS.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.467
JUST A LITTLE.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.569
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT IS THIS?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.828
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?
OF COURSE I DO.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.064
WHILE YOU WERE PLAYING
WITH LIGHT SWITCHES

09:35.100 --> 09:36.169
AND ORDERING BREAKFAST,

09:36.200 --> 09:37.360
I WAS INVESTIGATING A CASE.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.366
I SEE.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.502
OKAY.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.939
OKAY, I'LL BITE.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.677
WHERE IS HE,
CHOCOLATE COLUMBO?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.041
TRI-CON.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.411
WHAT?

09:48.450 --> 09:49.883
TRI-CON.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.138
THE TRI-ANNUAL COMIC BOOK
AND SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTION

09:52.190 --> 09:53.851
IS IN SANTA BARBARA
THIS WEEKEND.

09:53.890 --> 09:54.879
YOU SAW ALL THOSE
COMIC BOOKS

09:54.920 --> 09:56.387
IN MALONE'S ROOM.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.626
YOU'RE 18 YEARS OLD,
YOU HAVE A TON OF CASH

09:57.660 --> 09:58.752
BURNING A HOLE
IN YOUR POCKET,

09:58.790 --> 10:00.018
AND YOU LOVE COMICS?

10:00.060 --> 10:02.358
WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU GO
TO SPEND YOUR DISPOSABLE INCOME?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.197
THINK, SHAWN.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.197
GUS, I APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.561
THANK YOU.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.397
LET'S VERIFY IT
SO WE CAN GO CHECK IT OUT.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.169
SHAWN, I'M SURE HE'S THERE.
THERE'S NO DOUBT.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.063
YOU SURE?
YEP.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.407
HOW'S THAT?

10:19.720 --> 10:22.371
ARE THOSE DIRECTIONS
TO THE CONVENTION CENTER?

10:22.420 --> 10:23.580
I FOUND IT IN HIS WASTEBASKET.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.786
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
I NEVER SAID IT,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.457
I WAS REALLY PLEASED

10:31.490 --> 10:33.219
WHEN YOU WERE NAMED
AS CHIEF...

10:33.260 --> 10:34.625
INTERIM CHIEF.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.764
I'M SURE THAT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.563
M-HMM.
AND IT'S TRUE

10:38.600 --> 10:41.967
THAT THE OUTGOING CHIEF
WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.661
HE WAS MY MENTOR.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.462
MADE ME THE COP I AM TODAY.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.034
I KNOW THE OUTSIDE
CEPTION

10:47.080 --> 10:49.002
IS THAT THE FORCE
WAS A REAL BOYS' CLUB

10:49.040 --> 10:50.348
UNDER HIM,

10:50.380 --> 10:53.508
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY SMART
WHEN THEY NAMED A...

10:53.550 --> 10:55.313
YOU KNOW...

10:55.350 --> 10:57.238
WOMAN.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.780
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.959
EXCUSE ME. WHAT?

11:00.990 --> 11:02.116
I LOVE YOU.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.684
HUH?

11:03.730 --> 11:05.482
OKAY...

11:05.530 --> 11:07.691
YEAH, I'LL JUST SEE YOU
WHEN WE GET BACK.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.391
OKAY.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.091
I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.563
WERE YOU
SAYING SOMETHING?

11:13.800 --> 11:14.994
NO, I WASN'T.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.536
WE CAN'T JUST
WALK INTO THE CON.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.309
I'M SORRY...
"THE CON"?

11:22.340 --> 11:23.307
YEAH.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.703
YOU'RE CALLING A PLACE

11:24.750 --> 11:27.139
FILLED WITH OVERWEIGHT TEENAGERS
BATTLING MILD CASES OF SCOLIOSIS

11:27.180 --> 11:28.875
AND ADVANCED BEDWETTING

11:28.920 --> 11:30.649
"THE CON"?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.884
WE CAN'T GET IN THERE.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.182
THE TICKETS WERE SOLD OUT
A MONTH AGO.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.711
DID YOU ALREADY TRY
TO GET TICKETS?

11:36.760 --> 11:37.852
FOCUS, SHAWN.

11:37.890 --> 11:38.879
HOW MUCH WERE THEY?

11:38.930 --> 11:41.228
WILL YOU FOCUS?

11:41.260 --> 11:42.227
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.466
LEAVE THIS OUT OF SIGHT

11:43.500 --> 11:44.524
UNTIL WE GET
THE ISSUES RESOLVED

11:44.570 --> 11:45.821
WITH THE FOOD IN HIS ROOM.

11:45.870 --> 11:46.859
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S GOING TO WALK

11:46.900 --> 11:48.162
OVER THE BLUEBERRY ISSUE,

11:48.200 --> 11:49.462
BUT WE CANNOT HAVE
PEOPLE LINING UP

11:49.500 --> 11:50.967
UNTIL WE'RE SURE
HE'S PARTICIPATING.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.159
I GOT TO CALL HIS AGENT.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.802
GET ME A LIST
OF ALL THE PRODUCE VENDORS

11:53.840 --> 11:55.307
IN THE AREA.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.376
WE CAN'T RISK ALIENATING
THE STAR TR FANS.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.942
YOU CAN'T COME IN
WITHOUT TICKETS.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.642
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU
WE WERE COMING?

12:03.690 --> 12:04.987
WHO?

12:05.020 --> 12:06.510
WE WORK FOR GEORGE.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.152
"TA-KAI."

12:11.190 --> 12:13.420
YOU MEAN "TA-KAY"?

12:13.460 --> 12:14.552
YEAH, THOSE
CLOSEST TO HIM

12:14.600 --> 12:16.864
KNOW EXACTLY HOW
HE LIKES IT PRONOUNCED.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.492
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HAVE A CONVENTION

12:19.700 --> 12:20.860
SULU, JACKASS.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.094
HAVE HIS
FRESH BLUEBERRIES

12:22.140 --> 12:23.607
ARRIVED YET?

12:26.170 --> 12:28.934
I DON'T HAVE RECORD
OF RECEIVING THEM YET.

12:28.980 --> 12:31.778
YOU DON'T HAVE RECORD
OF HAVING RECEIVED THEM YET.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.619
GIVE ME THAT.

12:34.980 --> 12:35.969
[LAUGHS]

12:37.350 --> 12:39.648
THEY DON'T HAVE
THE FRESH BLUEBERRIES.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.555
[LAUGHS AWKWARDLY]

12:43.190 --> 12:44.828
W-WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

12:44.860 --> 12:45.827
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

12:45.860 --> 12:47.122
WHAT IS
THE BIG DEAL?

12:47.160 --> 12:48.297
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED

12:48.330 --> 12:49.297
WHEN THEY FORGOT
HIS BLUEBERRIES

12:49.330 --> 12:51.423
AT THE CON
IN SAN ANTONIO?

12:51.470 --> 12:53.290
THAT COMB-OVER'LL BE
THE LEAST OF YOUR...

12:54.870 --> 12:57.202
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S BETTER...

12:57.240 --> 12:59.265
IT'S BETTER
IF YOU DON'T KNOW.

12:59.310 --> 13:00.607
IT'S HOW I ENDED UP
WITH A STUTTER

13:00.640 --> 13:01.971
AND A WOODEN PINKIE TOE.

13:02.010 --> 13:03.773
NOW, FOR THE LOVE
OF SCOTTY--

13:03.810 --> 13:04.674
STILL SULU.

13:04.710 --> 13:05.574
WOULD YOU--

13:07.120 --> 13:08.576
P-PLEASE...

13:08.620 --> 13:10.019
LET ME GET IN THERE

13:10.050 --> 13:11.915
AND SAVE
ALL OF OUR ASSES?

13:28.970 --> 13:30.164
DUDE...

13:30.210 --> 13:31.199
SOME GUY
IN A WOLF COSTUME

13:31.240 --> 13:32.264
WITH A LIGHTSABER

13:32.310 --> 13:33.277
JUST SAID HI TO YOU.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.402
I DON'T KNOW THAT GUY.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.839
HE LOOKED RIGHT AT YOU.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.199
HE WAS MISTAKEN.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.138
HE SAID, "HI, GUS."

13:39.180 --> 13:42.479
AND THEN ANOTHER DUDE
WITH A CAPE AND A CODPIECE

13:42.520 --> 13:43.544
GAVE YOU A HALF-NOD.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.739
I DON'T KNOW ANY
OF THESE PEOPLE, SHAWN.

13:44.790 --> 13:45.745
UH-HUH.

13:45.790 --> 13:46.745
HEY, GUYS.

13:46.790 --> 13:47.950
I'M TALIA.
THIS IS DENT.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.287
WE'RE WITH
PARASTONE PICTURES,

13:49.320 --> 13:50.582
AND WANTED TO REMIND YOU

13:50.630 --> 13:53.349
TO SEE THE WORLD PREMIERE
OF THE RED PHANTOM TRAILER

13:53.400 --> 13:54.822
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.350
IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE
OF THE SUMMER. DO NOT MISS OUT.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.561
NO WAY. I LOVE
THE DEAD PHANTOM.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.898
RED PHANTOM.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.158
WHAT, HE DIDN'T DIE
AT THE END?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.531
BYE.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.434
GOING TO BOMB.
I HEAR THIS MOVIE'S

14:09.480 --> 14:10.902
IT'S TOO BAD.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.043
I KIND OF DUG
THE RED PHANTOM.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.570
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SEEN THE TRAILER

14:14.620 --> 14:15.678
AND YOU ALREADY HATE IT?

14:15.720 --> 14:16.675
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

14:16.720 --> 14:17.744
FORTRESS OF ATTITUDE.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.542
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

14:19.590 --> 14:20.818
FORTRESS OF ATTITUDE.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.918
IT'S THIS SITE

14:21.960 --> 14:23.382
THAT REVIEWS MOVIES
BASED ON COMIC BOOKS.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.852
THE MALCONTENT,
THE GUY WHO RUNS IT,

14:24.890 --> 14:26.118
SAYS HE ALREADY SAW

14:26.160 --> 14:28.048
A 30-MINUTE PRESENTATION
HERE AT THE CONVENTION.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.249
BLAZED IT ONLINE.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.858
CAN'T YOU JUST
LOOK AT PORN ON THE NET

14:30.900 --> 14:32.424
LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY
AND HIS BROTHER?

14:32.470 --> 14:33.698
EVERYBODY
READS THIS BLOG.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.560
NO, NOT EVERYBODY.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.828
EVERYBODY HERE DOES,
SHAWN...

14:36.870 --> 14:37.939
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:37.970 --> 14:39.301
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.137
SO WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME DO THE TALKING

14:41.180 --> 14:42.306
HERE AT THE CONVENTION,

14:42.340 --> 14:43.443
AND TRY NOT TO EMBARRASS ME.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.469
THIS IS MY TURF.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.579
AND YES,

14:45.610 --> 14:47.043
I KNEW THE GUY IN THE CODPIECE.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.447
HIS NAME IS DAVE,
AND HE'S A VERY NICE GUY.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.879
SNAP.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.197
TWO FOR 50 CENTS.

15:03.230 --> 15:04.367
WHAT?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.924
THAT'S HILTZ KOOLER.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.567
EXCUSE ME, MR. KOOLER?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.500
I'M A HUGE GREEN SPIRIT FAN.

15:11.540 --> 15:12.529
HE'S MY FAVORITE,
ACTUALLY.

15:12.570 --> 15:13.537
I WAS WONDERING...

15:13.580 --> 15:15.798
WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING
MY ORIGINAL COPY

15:15.840 --> 15:17.171
OF THE GREEN SPIRIT
STRIKES AGAIN?

15:17.210 --> 15:18.541
WHOA.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.241
HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE
IN A WHILE.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.475
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
I FOUND A GUY SELLING ONE.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.216
I LOVE HOW THIS REINVENTED
THE CHARACTER FOR TODAY.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.547
WELL, THERE YOU GO. ENJOY.

15:26.590 --> 15:27.716
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.216
YOU KNOW, I WISH
THEY'D BASED THE MOVIE

15:29.260 --> 15:30.227
ON THIS STORY ARC.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.420
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:31.460 --> 15:32.586
I TOLD THEM
ABOUT A MILLION TIMES,

15:32.630 --> 15:33.892
BUT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.056
STILL A HUGE FAN.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.852
WELL, I'M GLAD SOMEONE IS

15:36.900 --> 15:37.867
AFTER THAT
GREEN SPIRIT MOVIE.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.026
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.492
IS THIS
THE MOVIE YOU DRAGGED ME TO

15:40.540 --> 15:41.495
WHERE THE HERO
HAD BIG NIPPLES

15:41.540 --> 15:42.791
ON THE OUTSIDE
OF HIS COSTUME?

15:42.840 --> 15:44.535
DAMN THOSE NIPPLES.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.403
THEY WERE, LIKE,
BIG, ANGRY, MARSHMALLOWS.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.532
BE NICE TO HIM, SHAWN.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.604
THE GREEN SPIRIT MOVIE

15:49.640 --> 15:51.039
NEARLY KILLED
THE CHARACTER.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.015
GUS, ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS FINDING OUR GUYS.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.813
I CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.919
THERE'S TOO MUCH
REAL ESTATE.

15:58.950 --> 16:00.110
WE CAN'T COVER IT
ALL AT ONCE.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.889
MAYBE WE SHOULD SPLIT UP.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.558
I CAN HELP OUR SITUATION.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.597
SO, NEXT...

16:07.630 --> 16:09.996
NEXT ON OUR LIST... UH...

16:10.030 --> 16:10.997
SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?

16:11.030 --> 16:12.895
YEAH, I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.136
PSYCHIC...

16:14.170 --> 16:15.467
SBPD. I'LL JUST
NEED A MOMENT.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.467
PSYCHIC?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.104
WELCOME!

16:18.140 --> 16:18.959
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

16:19.010 --> 16:20.978
SCIENCE FICTION FANS,

16:21.010 --> 16:22.307
WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL TREAT
FOR YOU TODAY.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.705
WE HAVE A PSYCHIC,

16:23.750 --> 16:25.172
A REAL, LIVE,

16:27.380 --> 16:28.779
THIS IS, UH...

16:28.820 --> 16:32.779
IS MY SIDEKICK, MAGICHEAD.

16:33.990 --> 16:37.482
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC,
LIKE PROFESSOR X?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.350
PROFESSOR X IS A TELEPATH,
NOT A PSYCHIC.

16:39.390 --> 16:40.857
BUT I DO HAVE
TELEPATHIC TENDENCIES.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.855
NO, YOU DON'T.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.265
YOU HAVE PSYCHIC VISIONS.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.460
THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.592
NO, REALLY,
I CAN DO BOTH.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.699
NO, YOU CAN'T.

16:46.730 --> 16:47.992
CAN YOU READ ME?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.462
SURE.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.070
[CLEARS THROAT]

16:55.480 --> 16:56.777
I'M GETTING A READING.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.072
I'M GETTING A READING
RIGHT NOW, YES.

16:58.110 --> 16:59.543
YOU...

16:59.580 --> 17:02.617
SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME
IN FRONT OF YOUR COMPUTER.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.243
WHIOA!

17:05.290 --> 17:06.746
MM-HMM...

17:06.790 --> 17:07.688
AND I SEE A GIRL.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.618
YES.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.127
YOU LIKE HER...

17:10.160 --> 17:11.479
FROM AFAR.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.589
SHE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
YOU EXIST.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.291
YES, YES.

17:15.330 --> 17:16.797
HER NAME'S MEGAN.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.229
DO I HAVE A CHANCE?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.664
DON'T PUT TOO MUCH WORK
INTO IT.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.258
I THINK SHE MIGHT
WANT TO BE...

17:24.310 --> 17:25.732
"JUST FRIENDS."

17:27.210 --> 17:28.279
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOOKING FOR MALONE.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.073
OBVIOUSLY, MALONE IS KEEPING
A LOW PROFILE.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.543
WHOA! BOY!

17:31.580 --> 17:33.639
I'M GETTING-- WHOA!
I'M GETTING AN "R".

17:33.680 --> 17:36.114
I AM GETTING AN "R"!

17:36.150 --> 17:38.311
DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE A NAME
THAT BEGINS WITH "R"?

17:38.350 --> 17:39.487
OH, WAIT A SECOND!
WHOA...

17:39.520 --> 17:41.078

18:10.790 --> 18:12.246
SOMETIMES I SCARE MYSELF.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.597
HEY, FELLAS.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.598
FIRST, I NEED YOU BOTH
TO EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.

18:26.470 --> 18:27.459
AH!

18:28.740 --> 18:29.866
A ROOM KEY...

18:29.900 --> 18:31.106
EVEN THOUGH YOU BOTH
RESIDE LOCALLY.

18:31.140 --> 18:32.562
OH...

18:32.610 --> 18:34.430
OUR FRIEND SPRANG
FOR A HOTEL SUITE FOR US.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.879
AH, ROOM 129.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.104

18:37.150 --> 18:38.299
YES, OF COURSE.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.749
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

18:39.780 --> 18:40.849
THIS FRIEND YOU SPEAK OF,

18:40.880 --> 18:42.768
I SENSE YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM FOR A WHILE,

18:42.820 --> 18:44.481
BUT YOU DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.408
NO, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.680
YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS...

18:48.720 --> 18:50.449
YOU WERE GOING TO COMPUTER CAMP.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.856
COMPUTER CAMP, GUYS?

18:52.890 --> 18:54.152
REALLY?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.827
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HIDING!

18:58.570 --> 18:59.662
WE'RE NOT
GOING Al-TER THEM?

18:59.700 --> 19:01.634
WHAT FOR?
MALONE'S NOT WITH THEM.

19:01.670 --> 19:04.707
BUT I THINK I KNOW
WHERE HE MIGHT BE.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.174
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
SHAWN SPENCER!

19:07.210 --> 19:08.177
AND-- AND MAGICHEAD!

19:08.210 --> 19:09.199
LET'S CHECK OUT
ROOM 428.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.400
PRETTY CONVINCING.
WELL, THEY SEEMED

19:10.450 --> 19:12.645
THAT'S THEM THERE.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.648
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING PEOPLE

19:14.680 --> 19:16.477
YOU'RE MY ASSISTANTS?

19:16.520 --> 19:17.748
UH...

19:17.790 --> 19:20.145
BECAUSE WE ARE
YOUR ASSISTANTS.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.317
EXCUSE ME?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.328
ARE YOU SERIOUS,
GEORGE?

19:24.360 --> 19:27.227
I KNOW WE SAID WE'D WORK
OUTSIDE THE LOOP,

19:27.260 --> 19:28.818
BUT THIS IS
A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.521
I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.719
YOU HIRED US PERSONALLY.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.169
WE MET YOU IN CHICAGO,
AT A SCREENING

19:33.200 --> 19:34.792
OF THAT MOVIE
WITH THE WHALES.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.762
STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.199
THE LAST TIME
I WAS IN CHICAGO,

19:38.240 --> 19:40.572
I WAS DOING A READING
FROM MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.101
RIGHT. WE BOOKED THAT.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.407
REMEMBER, ROBIN TOLD US

19:45.450 --> 19:47.441
HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO
FILL A ROOM THAT SIZE?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.414
I DON'T KNOW ANY ROBINS.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.587
THAT'S BECAUSE I FIRED HER.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.644
LOOK, GEORGE,
YOU DON'T NEED

19:51.690 --> 19:53.180
THAT KIND
OF NEGATIVITY, OKAY?

19:53.220 --> 19:54.915
IT'S HER FAULT
WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN ANTONIO.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.313
THOUGH...

19:56.360 --> 19:57.884
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT FROM ME.

19:57.930 --> 19:58.885
I'M VERY CONFUSED.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.022
LOOK, GEORGE,

20:00.060 --> 20:01.254
WE CAN STAND AROUND
AND TALK ALL DAY...

20:01.300 --> 20:02.790
LIKE ROBIN USED TO.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.092
OR I CAN TRY
TO DO SOMETHING

20:04.130 --> 20:05.563
ABOUT SOLVING
YOUR BLUEBERRY CRISIS.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.965
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.195
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.537
GET TO IT.

20:10.570 --> 20:11.366
MM-HMM.
YOU.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.059
THANK YOU.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.368
EW!

20:16.410 --> 20:17.775
GOSH!

20:19.050 --> 20:20.779
I SEE WHY ROB AND DON
WERE FREAKED.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.775
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE

20:21.820 --> 20:23.117
FOR THIS MESS.

20:23.150 --> 20:25.141
THIS PLACE IS TRASHED.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.487
MAYBE JOHNNY DEPP
STOPPED BY.

[GIGGLES]

20:28.160 --> 20:29.718
I'M SORRY.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.489
DID THAT JOKE JUST ARRIVE
IN A TIME MACHINE FROM 1992?

20:31.530 --> 20:33.725
HE USED TO TRASH HOTEL ROOMS.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.829
USED TO.

20:34.860 --> 20:35.827
THE MAN HAS KIDS NOW.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.827
HE LIVES IN FRANCE.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.792
YOU GOT A BETTER VERSION?

20:37.830 --> 20:38.967
OF COURSE I DO.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.194
HOW ABOUT THAT LAME-O
WHO'S DATING KATE MOSS?

20:40.230 --> 20:42.095
HE'S BRITISH,
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.199
OKAY, FINE. TOO INSIDE.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.969
STEPHEN DORFF. ALWAYS SOLID.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.577
DUDE...

20:50.610 --> 20:52.407
COME HERE.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.413
WHY WOULD THIS KID
HAVE THESE MOCKUPS?

21:03.390 --> 21:05.483
BECAUSE I THINK
OUR MISSING PERSON

21:05.530 --> 21:07.498
HAS A SECRET IDENTITY.

21:07.530 --> 21:08.792
BY DAY,

21:08.830 --> 21:11.469
HE'S A LAPTOP-TOTING,
COMIC-LOVING VIRGIN.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.195
AT NIGHT...

21:13.230 --> 21:14.538
HE'S YOUR FAVORITE BLOGGER.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.492
YOU THINK THE MALCONTENT
IS THE KID?

21:16.540 --> 21:17.905
HE MUST'VE PISSED OFF
THE WRONG PEOPLE

21:17.940 --> 21:19.066
WITH HIS BLOG.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.503
SHAWN, LOOK.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.945
HMM.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.039
THERE GOES THE KID-
ON-A-SPENDING-SPREE THEORY.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.242
OOH!

21:31.290 --> 21:32.746
KEITH MOON.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.461
I JUST WENT OVER THE POSTS
ON MALONE'S BLOG.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.967
DID HE BASH
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.194
THE RED PHANTOM MOVIE.

21:47.230 --> 21:48.629
HE'S RELENTLESS.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.228
IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE
IF YOU GO BACK A LITTLE,

21:50.270 --> 21:51.908
HE WAS ORIGINALLY SAYING
GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.134
SO...

21:53.170 --> 21:54.637
SO PARASTONE PICTURES

21:54.680 --> 21:56.534
PAID HIM TO PRAISE
THE RED PHANTOM FLICK.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.945
THAT MUST BE WHERE ALL
THE MONEY FROM HIS ROOM

21:57.980 --> 21:58.947
CAME FROM.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.072
MAKES SENSE.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.577
MALONE'S BLOG STARTED
THE BAD BUZZ

22:01.620 --> 22:03.269
WHICH SUNK PARASTONE'S
LAST COMIC BOOK MOVIE.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.617
I DON'T THINK THE NIPPLES
HELPED EITHER, GUS.

22:04.650 --> 22:05.514
WELL, YEAH.

22:05.550 --> 22:06.847
SO THE STUDIO
HAD EVERYTHING RIDING

22:06.890 --> 22:08.016
ON THIS NEW FILM.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.288
THEY WOULD'VE DONE ANYTHING

22:09.320 --> 22:10.651
TO PREVENT HISTORY
FROM REPEATING ITSELF.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.021
BUT MALONE BLAZED
THE RED PHANTOM ANYWAY.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.288
HE RENEGED,

22:13.330 --> 22:14.251
WHICH MIGHT BE
WHY HE'S MISSING.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.597
WE NEED TO FIND THOSE EXECS.

22:15.630 --> 22:16.699
HEY.

22:16.730 --> 22:17.867
ANY PROGRESS?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.458
I PICKED UP
MALONE'S ASTRAL TRAIL.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.388
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.908
IT LEADS TO A HOTEL

22:23.940 --> 22:25.339
ACROSS FROM
THE CONVENTION CENTER.

22:25.370 --> 22:26.405
ROOM 428.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.532
OAK DOOR,
CAN'T MISS IT.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.070
THAT'S MORE SPECIFIC
THAN USUAL.

22:29.110 --> 22:31.249
SOMETIMES THE SPIRITS
ARE IN A GIVING MOOD.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.872
NOW, YOU WON'T FIND MALONE,

22:32.910 --> 22:33.911
BUT I SENSE

22:33.950 --> 22:35.872
SOME SERIOUSLY DARK
JUJU-MAGUMBO

22:35.920 --> 22:36.909
WENT DOWN IN THERE.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.212
YEAH, SEND SOME UNIFORMS

22:38.250 --> 22:39.911
TO THE HOTEL ACROSS
FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER

22:39.950 --> 22:42.510
AND TELL THEM
TO CORDON OFF ROOM 428.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.051
GOOD.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.354
THIS HAD BETTER BE
FOR REAL.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.095
SO, HOW'S THE CONVENTION?

22:49.130 --> 22:50.825
A LOT OF COOL STUFF
GOING ON, I BET.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.394
OH, COME ON.
NOT YOU, TOO.

22:52.430 --> 22:53.590
YOU'RE
A COLLECTOR, TOO?

22:53.640 --> 22:54.698
SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.139
I JUST GOT
HILTZ KOOLER'S AUTOGRAPH.

22:56.170 --> 22:57.432
SHUT UP. YOU DID NOT.

22:57.470 --> 22:58.664
YES, I DID.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.961
HI. MISSING KID.
WORRIED MOM.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.830
CAN WE FOCUS HERE?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.177
SINCE WHEN DID YOU GET
SO STRUCTURED?

23:03.210 --> 23:04.472
SINCE YOU TURNED
INTO URKEL, AND--

23:04.510 --> 23:05.772
AND YOU...

23:05.810 --> 23:07.516
JUST BECAME...

23:07.550 --> 23:10.212
JAN...BRADY...
TINA YOTHERS...

23:10.250 --> 23:11.979
THERE'S... IT'S...

23:12.020 --> 23:14.181
THERE'S NOT AN EXACT...
MATCH FOR THAT.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.653
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HER

23:15.690 --> 23:16.759
ABOUT OUR SUSPICIONS

23:16.790 --> 23:17.950
OF THE PARASTONE
EXECUTIVES?

23:17.990 --> 23:19.321
PLEASE, GUS.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.794
WE HAVE TO LEAVE SOMETHING
TO DIVINE LATER.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.354
YEAH...

23:23.400 --> 23:25.095
THIS IS NICE.

23:25.130 --> 23:28.497
SOME GOOD
ONE-ON-ONE TIME.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.996
LETTING THE GUARD DOWN.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.359
YOU KNOW, I HAD AN IDEA
NOT TOO LONG AGO,

23:33.410 --> 23:35.071
AND IT'S FUNNY I SHOULD
THINK OF IT NOW,

23:35.110 --> 23:36.907
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE

23:36.940 --> 23:38.578
TO HAVE SO MANY
OFFICERS WORKING

23:38.610 --> 23:40.510
THE DAYTIME SHIFT
AT GRAB.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.211
MOST CAR TH EI-TS
OCCUR AT NIGHT.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.081
LASSITER--
IF YOU WERE TO
SPLIT THE SHIFT--

23:44.120 --> 23:45.144
NOW, GO WITH ME
ON THIS ONE--

23:45.190 --> 23:46.418
TON!
WHAT?

23:46.450 --> 23:47.781
MY WATER JUST BROKE.

23:47.820 --> 23:49.754
ARE YOU SURE?

23:49.790 --> 23:50.984
NO, CARLTON.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.180
THERE'S WATER SPILLING OUT OF ME
FOR SOME OTHER REASON.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.754
OH, NO.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.392
OH, CAN YOU MOVE MY BRIEFCASE?

23:56.430 --> 23:58.398
IT MIGHT BE
IN THE LINE OF THE--

23:58.430 --> 23:59.727
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THIS IS?

23:59.770 --> 24:00.737
IT'S LEATHER.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.135
I DIDN'T
SCOTCH-GUARD IT.

24:02.170 --> 24:03.262
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:03.300 --> 24:04.801
NO, NEVER MIND.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.570
IT JUST HAS TREMENDOUS
SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

24:07.610 --> 24:08.736
JUST TAKE ME
TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL,

24:08.780 --> 24:09.735
ALL RIGHT?

24:09.780 --> 24:12.669
OH, I DON'T THINK
WE NEED THAT.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.541
OH, I THINK WE DO.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.547
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:15.580 --> 24:16.569
I'LL USE THE SIREN, TOO.

24:16.620 --> 24:17.587
FOR YOU.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.941
JUST IN CASE.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.981
[SIREN WAILING]

24:25.460 --> 24:26.688
HEY, GUYS.
HEY.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.719

24:27.760 --> 24:29.728
GOT TO SIGN
AUTOGRAPHS.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.068
LOOK, DUDE, I GOT A DATE

24:31.100 --> 24:32.169
WITH THAT TALIA GIRL
FROM THE STUDIO

24:32.200 --> 24:33.497
IN, LIKE, AN HOUR.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.098
A NICE, ROMANTIC WALK
ON THE BEACH TO JIM'S.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.664
BEST SCUNGILLI
IN SANTA BARBARA.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.258
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
TALK TO HER NOW?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.369
BECAUSE, GUS, HAPPY HOUR
DOESN'T START UNTIL 5:00.

24:40.410 --> 24:41.502
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FIGURING OUT

24:41.540 --> 24:42.677
IF SHE'S INNOCENT.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.541
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I PLAN TO DO.

24:44.580 --> 24:45.808
SHAWN.

24:45.850 --> 24:46.999
G.T.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.574
THE BLUEBERRIES
ARE STILL WRONG.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.417
I REQUESTED

24:50.450 --> 24:51.314
NORTH CAROLINA
BLUEBERRIES,

24:51.350 --> 24:52.487
BUT THEY SENT ME

24:52.520 --> 24:54.010
MICHIGAN BLUEBERRIES.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.928
PEOPLE SAY I'M CRAZY,
BUT I CAN TASTE THE DIFFERENCE.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.222
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S CRAZY AT ALL.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.557
AND...

25:00.600 --> 25:03.694
I REQUESTED THAT MY GREEN ROOM
NOT BE AT THE END OF THE HALL.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.595
I HAVE TO BE
IN THE MIDDLE.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.064
IT'S AFFECTING MY CHI.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.237
GUS?
WHAT?

25:09.270 --> 25:10.237
DID YOU SKIMP OUT

25:10.270 --> 25:11.100
AND GET THE MICHIGAN
BLUEBERRIES?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.232
WHAT?

25:12.270 --> 25:13.430
AND SCREW UP
THE ROOM LOCATION?

25:13.470 --> 25:14.630
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO GEORGE'S CHI?

25:14.680 --> 25:15.738
ARE YOU TOUCHING IT AND WHATNOT?

25:15.780 --> 25:16.929
STOP IT.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.174
THIS IS MY FAULT,
MR. TAKEI.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.199
MY FAULT

25:19.250 --> 25:20.274
FOR FARMING OUT RESPONSIBILITIES

25:20.310 --> 25:21.277

25:29.090 --> 25:30.409
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

25:30.460 --> 25:34.419
GOOD HELP IS HARD TO FIND,
I SUPPOSE.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.020
WHY DID YOU
BLAME THAT ON ME?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.196
DUDE, WE NEEDED
A FALL GUY.

25:39.230 --> 25:40.299
I'M CAN'T BE
THE FALL GUY

25:40.330 --> 25:41.831
IN FRONT OF
ONE OF MY HEROES, SHAWN.

25:41.870 --> 25:43.064
OKAY, YOU AND I
NEED TO CREATE

25:43.100 --> 25:44.533
A THIRD IMAGINARY
ASSISTANT

25:44.570 --> 25:45.969
THAT'S COMPLETELY
INCOMPETENT.

25:46.010 --> 25:47.875
I THINK HER NAME
SHOULD BE BEATRICE.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.832
WHAT SAY YOU?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.006
[TALIA]: ALL RIGHT.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.348
YEAH, JUST SEND IT
TO MY ASSISTANT.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.870
IT'S TREMENDOUS.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.285
YOU DON'T MIND IT,
THOUGH.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.117
YOU DON'T MIND ALL
THE COMIC BOOK STUFF.

26:00.150 --> 26:01.811
IT'S FUN, HARMLESS.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.054
A LITTLE WISH-FULFILLMENT.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.489
OH, COME ON.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.622
YOU DIDN'T PRETEND
TO FLY AROUND

26:05.660 --> 26:06.649
LIKE SUPERMAN

26:06.690 --> 26:08.726
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.455
SO, UH,

26:18.970 --> 26:20.335
IS THAT ALL
ANYONE REMEMBERS

26:20.370 --> 26:21.337
ABOUT THAT MOVIE?

26:21.380 --> 26:22.529
YES.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.774
WE HAD TO BUILD
A LANDFILL

26:23.810 --> 26:25.675
FOR THE UNSOLD
ACTION FIGURES.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.746
SO WE'RE PULLING OUT
ALL THE STOPS

26:27.780 --> 26:30.214
TO LAUNCH THE TRAILER
FOR THE RED PHANTOM MOVIE.

26:36.690 --> 26:37.850

AND MOST VITAL STEP

26:37.890 --> 26:39.255

26:39.290 --> 26:40.996

TO PAY SOMEBODY OFF?

26:41.030 --> 26:42.349
WHAT?

26:42.400 --> 26:43.765
HMM?

26:43.800 --> 26:44.892
LET'S SAY THERE'S
A BLOGGER, RIGHT?

26:44.930 --> 26:47.364
AND HE'S WIELDING WAY MORE POWER
THAN HE SHOULD,

26:47.400 --> 26:48.890
AND HE CAN BE HAD
FOR A PRICE.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.329
YOU GUYS WOULD BE FOOLS
NOT TO TAKE A SHOT, RIGHT?

26:51.370 --> 26:52.598
WHO ARE YOU, SHAWN?

26:52.640 --> 26:53.834
I'M A PSYCHIC.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.272

A DISAPPEARANCE.

A LOT ABOUT HIM.

27:07.620 --> 27:08.814
AND NOW HE'S MISSING.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.748
MISSING?

27:10.790 --> 27:13.179
LOOK, WHETHER OR NOT THIS GUY
HAD A CONSULTATION FEE

27:13.230 --> 27:14.458
IS BESIDE THE POINT.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.558
WE DON'T HARM PEOPLE.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.624
IT'S JUST A MOVIE.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.628

27:18.670 --> 27:20.365
YOU THINK YOUR BOSS
WILL TELL ME THE SAME THING?

27:20.400 --> 27:21.492
I DON'T KNOW.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.791
WHY DON'T WE GO ASK HIM
TOGETHER?

27:23.770 --> 27:24.998
AT OUR CONVENTION
HEADQUARTERS.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.803
FINE.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.637
SO NO SCUNGILLI, THEN?

27:31.710 --> 27:33.109
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE SO COOPERATIVE,

27:33.150 --> 27:34.742
SO IF I SEEMED
A LITTLE PUSHY--

27:34.780 --> 27:36.475
ACCUSING ME
OF KIDNAPPING?

27:36.520 --> 27:37.714
I ACCUSED YOU
OF BRIBERY.

27:37.750 --> 27:38.739

27:38.790 --> 27:39.745
YOU MAY HAVE HAD
SOMETHING TO DO

27:39.790 --> 27:40.859
WITH THE KIDNAPPING.

27:40.890 --> 27:42.448
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

27:42.490 --> 27:43.980
A LOT OF COUPLES START OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.383
IT JUST MEANS WE HAVE
NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.227

28:27.370 --> 28:28.689
BEFORE THE BLOGS
SHOWED UP.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.798

"THE GUILTY WILL PAY."

28:38.810 --> 28:40.038
WOW.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.342
ONE OF THESE
COMIC BOOK FREAKS

28:41.380 --> 28:42.472

BLURRED THE LINE

28:42.520 --> 28:46.786
BETWEEN REALITY AND...

28:46.820 --> 28:48.117
COMIC BOOK.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.458
THE KIDNAPPER STILL HAS
ONE MORE PERSON TO SNATCH.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.026
AND IT APPEARS
HE'S TARGETING

28:52.060 --> 28:53.550

30:21.180 --> 30:22.147
I DON'T NEED IT.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.215
LISTEN,
I WOULD PUT MYSELF

HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THIS?

30:33.130 --> 30:34.392

IS A STUNT.

30:34.430 --> 30:35.727
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:35.760 --> 30:37.057
TO PROMOTE THE MOVIE.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.567
THE WHOLE SCENARIO'S JUST...

30:38.600 --> 30:39.828
SO FANTASTICAL.

IT'S LIKE A PLOT
TO A COMIC BOOK.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.895

MAYBE TALIA.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.407
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
ALL THREE OF THEM.

ABOUT CUTTING THE CORD

40:00.860 --> 40:01.997
