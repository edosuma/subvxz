WEBVTT

01:57.867 --> 01:58.367
Amber?

02:00.503 --> 02:02.772
Oh dear, I frightened you.

02:04.739 --> 02:05.540
I'm Cynthia Miller.

02:05.608 --> 02:07.543
I'm here to show you around.

02:07.609 --> 02:08.443
Cynthia.

02:08.510 --> 02:09.778
It's nice to finally meet you.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.515
Impressive, isn't it?

02:14.883 --> 02:16.785
Come, I'll show you
the living room.

02:26.161 --> 02:29.598
If I remember correctly,
you teach music, right?

02:29.664 --> 02:30.832
I compose actually.

02:32.234 --> 02:35.604
Teaching helped me make ends
meet in the early days.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.006
Well the piano may need
some tuning,

02:38.073 --> 02:40.543
but we can include it
in the price.

02:42.677 --> 02:44.212
In fact, if you see anything
you like,

02:44.280 --> 02:45.782
we can include it in the price.

02:50.286 --> 02:54.424
So it has original hardware,
and everything works.

02:56.692 --> 02:57.727
Is this your first home?

02:58.561 --> 03:01.063
I just sold my home in Seattle.

03:01.129 --> 03:03.832
Well that's quite a change
from the big city...

03:11.907 --> 03:13.175
This is the guest room.

03:13.241 --> 03:15.877
There's a nice view
of the mountains from here.

03:17.246 --> 03:19.081
In fact, there are four full
bedrooms,

03:19.147 --> 03:20.650
if you're planning a big family.

03:23.185 --> 03:25.152
Wait till you see the master
bedroom.

03:41.604 --> 03:42.737
I love it.

03:43.838 --> 03:44.774
Come.

03:45.139 --> 03:46.475
There's more.

03:54.182 --> 03:56.585
Wouldn't this make a great
office?

04:05.627 --> 04:07.695
Why don't you take some time and
think about everything

04:07.763 --> 04:08.764
that you've seen?

04:09.230 --> 04:10.900
I'll just be downstairs.

04:16.205 --> 04:17.740
She's lost a lot of blood!

04:19.108 --> 04:19.675
Stay with me.

04:19.742 --> 04:20.943
Stay with me!

04:21.744 --> 04:24.647
We're losing her.

04:32.788 --> 04:34.557
Oh, I'm just gonna call you
back...

04:36.959 --> 04:38.194
So?

04:41.797 --> 04:43.899
The house seems so...

04:43.966 --> 04:45.233
...lonely.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.670
Well, no one's lived here in
a very long time...

04:49.737 --> 04:52.875
But I think the house is ready
for a new occupant, don't you?

04:54.742 --> 04:57.211
It might need a little bit of
fixing up.

04:57.278 --> 04:58.779
Some paint chips.

04:58.846 --> 05:00.882
A few nails in the wall.

05:00.949 --> 05:02.951
But I know the perfect handyman.

06:16.891 --> 06:17.993
Catchy tune, huh?

06:19.194 --> 06:21.829
Well it's, a bit creepy, don't
you think?

06:21.896 --> 06:22.897
It's supposed to be.

06:24.031 --> 06:25.199
Good morning, Jim.

06:25.266 --> 06:26.334
Boss.

06:27.401 --> 06:28.235
I didn't hear you come in.

06:28.302 --> 06:30.404
I didn't want to disturb you.

06:30.471 --> 06:32.039
Taking the initiative.

06:32.107 --> 06:33.041
I like that.

06:34.142 --> 06:35.476
Just doing my job.

06:35.543 --> 06:37.947
No, you're doing a very good
job, Jim.

06:42.317 --> 06:43.819
What made you come here?

06:45.821 --> 06:47.322
The solitude.

06:47.389 --> 06:49.357
Does wonders for my work.

06:49.423 --> 06:50.992
Only wish I'd done it sooner.

06:51.826 --> 06:53.060
I mean why here?

06:53.127 --> 06:55.430
This place is so isolated.

06:55.497 --> 06:57.366
Isn't there anyone that
misses you?

07:01.403 --> 07:04.139
Hey I better go back to work,
um...

07:04.206 --> 07:06.307
If you want, I can start on
something else, maybe paint

07:06.375 --> 07:07.408
the upstairs hallway or...

07:07.475 --> 07:08.810
No, no it's okay.

07:08.877 --> 07:12.014
Um, it's a nice day, I'll just
take my work outside.

07:14.583 --> 07:15.751
Amber?

07:18.319 --> 07:20.790
I'll try to mind my own
from now on.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.149
Someone there?

09:00.322 --> 09:01.823
It was just a dream.

09:02.557 --> 09:03.793
You fell asleep.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.561
My eyes and ears were wide open.

09:06.628 --> 09:08.562
Classic daydreaming.

09:08.629 --> 09:11.801
You know, you wouldn't be
the first to experience one.

09:13.601 --> 09:15.236
Hey, you know what the first
sign of going crazy is,

09:15.303 --> 09:16.403
don't you?

09:16.471 --> 09:17.304
No.

09:17.371 --> 09:19.007
Hair growing on your knuckles.

09:21.342 --> 09:22.944
Second sign is looking.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.250
What if there is someone
living here?

09:29.650 --> 09:33.053
Squatters or, kids camping out?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.189
I can take a look around
the property tomorrow

09:35.256 --> 09:39.894
before I start work... speaking
of which, I gotta get going.

09:41.229 --> 09:42.565
Hey, Jim?

09:44.332 --> 09:46.067
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

09:46.134 --> 09:47.235
I can't.

09:47.302 --> 09:50.105
I still got a few things to pick
up in town

09:50.172 --> 09:52.106
and it's a long drive, um.

09:53.107 --> 09:54.042
Rain check?

09:57.211 --> 09:59.648
Sure, another time.

09:59.715 --> 10:00.548
Cool.

10:00.615 --> 10:01.884
Later boss.

10:47.596 --> 10:49.197
Over here!

11:36.477 --> 11:37.612
Mark.

11:39.214 --> 11:40.215
Hello dear.

11:40.849 --> 11:42.350
What are you doing here?

11:43.717 --> 11:46.154
This is thirty-seven Maple
Street.

11:46.754 --> 11:48.289
I've come home.

11:51.225 --> 11:53.227
You made me break into
my own home, Amber.

11:57.798 --> 11:59.634
Do you know why you fear
commitment

11:59.701 --> 12:01.135
when you're faced with it?

12:04.405 --> 12:05.373
I know.

12:06.374 --> 12:08.009
What do you want, Mark?

12:08.876 --> 12:10.044
Loyalty.

12:11.111 --> 12:13.381
That's all I ever expected
from you.

12:16.283 --> 12:18.052
But you couldn't do that.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.254
Your loyalty was always
somewhere else.

12:21.188 --> 12:24.558
Somewhere I wasn't privileged
enough to be a part of.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.593
You have to admit,

12:26.660 --> 12:29.130
we had something wonderful
going on between us.

12:30.465 --> 12:36.204
You working, me tending to you
side by side, always together,

12:36.270 --> 12:38.740
everyday together,
and then suddenly...

12:38.807 --> 12:42.644
...let's all celebrate, Amber
Waltz, the musical prodigy!

12:42.711 --> 12:44.745
Amber Waltz,
the gifted pianist.

12:44.812 --> 12:46.114
No need for Mark anymore.

12:46.181 --> 12:47.615
Who's Mark?

12:47.682 --> 12:49.418
People don't talk to me anymore.

12:50.485 --> 12:52.187
Now I'm the nobody.

12:52.254 --> 12:52.788
Please.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.156
I love you.

12:56.158 --> 12:59.094
You're handsome and intelligent
and generous.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.361
You're extremely generous.

13:01.428 --> 13:02.496
Don't forget violent.

13:02.563 --> 13:04.531
I'm still violent!

13:04.599 --> 13:06.735
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

13:08.302 --> 13:10.237
I can still be there for you,
I can.

13:10.304 --> 13:13.107
- I can, I can...
- I told you, Amber...

13:13.841 --> 13:16.543
...next time we were together,
you wouldn't believe

13:16.610 --> 13:18.047
what I'd do for you.

13:19.280 --> 13:19.680
Mark!

13:19.748 --> 13:20.716
No!

13:37.966 --> 13:41.302
You wouldn't believe
what I'd do for you.

13:41.635 --> 13:42.669
Mark, no!

13:55.482 --> 13:56.416
Oh, Amber.

13:56.484 --> 13:59.187
See what you make me do?

15:43.091 --> 15:43.591
What ya lookin' at?

15:44.759 --> 15:47.562
Jim, Jim look,
over there by the...

15:56.471 --> 15:58.206
What am I looking at?

16:00.008 --> 16:01.809
Probably an animal.

16:01.875 --> 16:02.944
Deer maybe.

16:07.481 --> 16:08.415
Come on.

16:08.482 --> 16:09.450
Coffee's on.

16:15.123 --> 16:16.291
You okay?

16:17.524 --> 16:18.626
I'm good.

16:19.626 --> 16:20.596
Are you?

16:22.730 --> 16:23.731
Yeah.

16:24.365 --> 16:26.235
Why do you sound surprised?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.369
'Cause...

16:28.436 --> 16:29.836
...you know,
hearing the voice and all...

16:29.903 --> 16:30.772
Humming.

16:30.839 --> 16:32.307
I heard humming.

16:32.907 --> 16:34.341
Right, humming.

16:34.408 --> 16:37.077
You were tripping about that
yesterday, and then earlier...

16:37.144 --> 16:39.680
Okay, maybe a little tired.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.249
And stressed.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.519
That too...

16:47.389 --> 16:49.024
You let your hair down.

16:54.928 --> 16:57.265
Hey, I better go
check on the property now.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.401
Gonna paint the little room
upstairs when I get back.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.303
That way you can get some
work done.

18:07.134 --> 18:08.936
Doctor Pearl please.

18:09.003 --> 18:10.070
<i>Would you like
to schedule an appointment?</i>

18:10.137 --> 18:13.040
No, I'm calling long distance.

18:13.942 --> 18:15.676
I just need a moment.

18:16.009 --> 18:18.179
It's personal.

18:18.246 --> 18:19.547
<i>I'm sorry, but Doctor
Pearl's with a patient right now.</i>

18:19.614 --> 18:22.517
<i>If you give me your name
and number</i>

18:22.584 --> 18:22.984
<i>I'll have him return your call
when he's available.</i>

19:54.976 --> 19:56.043
Stop fucking around.

19:56.109 --> 19:57.445
It's over.

20:29.911 --> 20:30.912
Hello?

21:20.694 --> 21:23.731
So the station just changed
by itself?

21:26.933 --> 21:29.671
And, ah, you heard whispering.

21:32.306 --> 21:35.175
You did have an
intruder on your property.

21:35.242 --> 21:36.677
This is Miko.

21:38.913 --> 21:43.084
She's usually pretty shy,
but I think she likes you.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.796
Maybe I should spend the night.

21:55.930 --> 21:57.163
No it's, it's fine, Jim.

21:57.230 --> 21:58.232
Really.

21:58.465 --> 22:00.233
No seriously, Amber.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.703
I don't mind staying if it makes
you feel safe.

22:03.304 --> 22:05.707
I'm okay, honestly.

22:06.173 --> 22:08.042
I'm just a little tired.

22:08.942 --> 22:10.711
I didn't get enough sleep
last night.

22:15.048 --> 22:16.283
Good night, Jim.

22:19.854 --> 22:22.289
I'm gonna be honest with you,
Amber.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.626
I like you.

22:29.196 --> 22:30.798
Go home, Jim.

27:41.142 --> 27:42.409
Here she is.

27:42.476 --> 27:43.578
Sleep well?

27:44.211 --> 27:44.644
Yes.

27:44.711 --> 27:45.245
Good.

27:45.311 --> 27:46.346
Coffee's on.

27:52.519 --> 27:54.154
You look very good today.

27:55.522 --> 27:57.024
Thank you.

27:59.393 --> 28:00.361
You okay?

28:05.532 --> 28:07.601
I don't know.

28:09.603 --> 28:12.073
Well some coffee will fix that.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.275
Smells good, huh?

29:22.809 --> 29:24.243
Hey Amber, I still need to...

29:24.310 --> 29:26.013
Did you hear that?

29:27.748 --> 29:30.084
That scraping sound through
the floorboards?

29:30.851 --> 29:32.786
Ah, could be the boiler.

29:32.853 --> 29:34.455
You did just have a shower.

29:34.821 --> 29:36.823
It didn't sound like that.

29:36.891 --> 29:39.426
Oh god I hope I don't have
a rat problem.

29:39.492 --> 29:40.660
I hate rats.

29:40.728 --> 29:43.096
Relax, I'm sure it's the boiler.

29:43.163 --> 29:44.499
I'll check the cellar later.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.732
I've got a few more things
I need to pick up in town.

29:46.799 --> 29:48.234
You need anything
while I'm there?

29:48.301 --> 29:49.269
No, I'm good.

30:34.748 --> 30:36.283
Hello!

31:03.644 --> 31:04.845
Hello?

31:24.832 --> 31:25.966
I don't understand.

31:26.032 --> 31:29.368
The door was locked,
I am certain of it.

31:29.435 --> 31:31.771
And then I got to thinking,
maybe it was open all along,

31:31.838 --> 31:33.874
but I know that it wasn't.

31:36.809 --> 31:38.778
<i>What's the weather like today?</i>

31:38.846 --> 31:40.948
Was it windy?

31:41.015 --> 31:43.317
Not enough to blow
that door open.

31:45.318 --> 31:47.753
<i>Your handyman?</i>

31:47.820 --> 31:50.690
He's in town, running errands.

31:50.758 --> 31:51.892
<i>And your neighbours.</i>

31:51.959 --> 31:54.595
<i>They weren't pulling some prank
on you?</i>

31:54.662 --> 31:56.264
I've never even met them.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.735
<i>Are you
documenting these events?</i>

32:01.801 --> 32:03.670
Why?

32:03.737 --> 32:08.375
<i>Amber,
I'd just like to refer you to someone.</i>

32:08.442 --> 32:09.710
<i>He's a local.</i>

32:09.777 --> 32:12.511
I didn't call you
for a referral.

32:12.578 --> 32:14.581
<i>I've heard
he's an amazing doctor.</i>

32:21.587 --> 32:22.923
<i>Amber?</i>

32:24.857 --> 32:26.492
<i>You really should see someone
if...</i>

32:26.559 --> 32:27.461
Stop it, okay?

32:27.528 --> 32:29.596
Just... stop it.

32:31.030 --> 32:33.634
Look, I'll admit that
I was messed up.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.002
Mark nearly killed me.

32:36.069 --> 32:39.272
But I know that what I am seeing
and what I am hearing

32:39.339 --> 32:40.574
is not just some symptom
of that.

32:40.641 --> 32:41.509
<i>I never said that...</i>

32:41.576 --> 32:43.944
I do not need a fucking shrink!

32:45.778 --> 32:48.915
I'm not, I'm not crazy.

32:59.992 --> 33:01.628
Doctor Pearl?

33:04.097 --> 33:06.365
<i>I'm here, Amber.</i>

33:06.432 --> 33:09.435
<i>Just thinking about
how stressed you sound.</i>

33:11.505 --> 33:14.308
I'm exhausted, okay?

33:14.375 --> 33:15.910
Just exhausted.

33:18.378 --> 33:19.879
<i>Then let
me prescribe something.</i>

33:24.785 --> 33:26.987
Fine.

33:27.054 --> 33:28.656
Something to help me sleep.

33:32.625 --> 33:36.430
Something strong, so I don't
wake up at night.

33:46.773 --> 33:49.008
That scraping sound.

33:49.076 --> 33:50.310
It was a crow.

33:52.945 --> 33:54.548
A crow?

33:56.150 --> 33:58.919
Do you remember asking me
why I came here?

34:05.425 --> 34:09.529
You asked if I had anyone
who missed me.

34:11.864 --> 34:14.000
His name was Mark.

34:14.067 --> 34:16.971
And I loved him, very much.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.076
Mark was a troubled man.

34:23.143 --> 34:24.978
Mark, no!

34:28.215 --> 34:30.985
The wound took three months
to heal.

34:35.556 --> 34:38.425
I was the one who persuaded him
to seek help.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.762
I was the one who wouldn't let
him come home.

34:45.731 --> 34:48.735
He wasn't there to hurt me,

34:48.802 --> 34:50.103
but the treatment...

34:52.472 --> 34:55.741
...it made him see things about
himself that he just...

34:55.809 --> 34:57.545
he couldn't live with.

35:05.152 --> 35:06.987
Ever since,...

35:08.688 --> 35:10.357
...I've been...

35:12.125 --> 35:14.795
Oh, why is this so fucking
difficult?

35:36.916 --> 35:38.052
What I've been through...

35:40.186 --> 35:42.056
...it makes most people
uncomfortable,...

35:44.257 --> 35:46.092
...so I'm afraid
that you might...

35:47.661 --> 35:49.028
Judge you?

35:50.297 --> 35:51.998
I'm pretty good at helping
others through

35:52.065 --> 35:53.601
stressful times in life.

35:58.005 --> 35:59.673
This house is haunted.

36:02.108 --> 36:03.643
She wrote this.

36:05.612 --> 36:07.481
And she changed
the radio station.

36:07.547 --> 36:08.948
She?

36:09.016 --> 36:10.483
You saw her?

36:10.550 --> 36:11.851
She came to me.

36:12.985 --> 36:14.855
She played piano.

36:17.690 --> 36:19.925
So beautiful...

36:19.992 --> 36:22.061
A brunette...

36:22.128 --> 36:23.797
With these eyes...

36:29.235 --> 36:31.237
I don't know
who she is or what she wants.

36:31.304 --> 36:33.440
But, you have to find out.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.777
Are you fucking with me?

36:38.811 --> 36:40.846
Amber, please.

36:40.914 --> 36:43.083
You're my boss.

36:46.353 --> 36:49.923
Seriously though,
I'm always at your service.

36:49.989 --> 36:52.291
You should know that by now.

36:52.358 --> 36:53.726
Anything you need,...

36:56.228 --> 36:57.630
...all you have to do is ask.

36:59.666 --> 37:01.501
Deal?

37:42.842 --> 37:44.644
Um, Mrs. Murphy?

37:46.045 --> 37:48.581
Hello.

37:48.648 --> 37:49.848
Hi.

37:49.916 --> 37:51.084
I wanted to introduce myself...

37:51.150 --> 37:53.152
I know who you are.

37:53.219 --> 37:54.954
You're pretty.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.190
Thank you.

37:57.257 --> 37:59.259
Um, I wanted to ask you
a few questions...

37:59.326 --> 38:00.961
There you are.

38:01.027 --> 38:02.596
You should go back inside, dear.

38:02.663 --> 38:04.532
You haven't finished your lunch.

38:07.367 --> 38:09.537
What can I do for you
Miss Waltz?

38:11.338 --> 38:12.872
It's about the house.

38:12.938 --> 38:15.207
Isn't she pretty?

38:15.275 --> 38:17.644
I look like you in my dreams.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.312
Quiet!

38:21.782 --> 38:25.085
If this is about the house,
there's no going back on it.

38:25.152 --> 38:26.420
No, that's not why I'm here.

38:26.487 --> 38:28.688
I just wanted to ask
Mrs. Murphy a few questions.

38:28.755 --> 38:31.625
You can see, she's in no
condition for any of that.

38:31.692 --> 38:33.626
What about Mr. Murphy,
is he around?

38:33.693 --> 38:35.329
Not anymore.

38:36.963 --> 38:39.165
I made him go away.

38:39.231 --> 38:41.735
I hate him!

38:41.802 --> 38:43.068
I hate him!

38:43.135 --> 38:44.903
I hate him!!

38:44.971 --> 38:46.905
- Please, you're confusing her.
- I hate him!

38:46.972 --> 38:47.907
I hate him!

38:47.974 --> 38:50.043
I hate him!

38:50.110 --> 38:51.644
I hate him!

38:51.711 --> 38:52.778
I hate him!

39:20.373 --> 39:21.976
<i>Hello, Amber?</i>

39:24.177 --> 39:26.379
<i>...Right away Ms Waltz.</i>

39:43.963 --> 39:45.032
Amber?

39:48.034 --> 39:49.702
Oh dear, I frightened you.

39:57.911 --> 40:00.012
Is everything okay?

40:00.079 --> 40:01.146
Ah.

40:01.213 --> 40:01.713
Yes.

40:02.983 --> 40:03.517
It's fine.

40:03.583 --> 40:05.217
Really. Uh.

40:05.284 --> 40:07.286
I just came into town to visit
Mrs. Murphy.

40:08.954 --> 40:10.989
What on earth for?

40:11.056 --> 40:13.158
I wanted to ask her a few
questions about the house,

40:13.226 --> 40:14.795
and its history.

40:15.929 --> 40:17.931
But you didn't know
she was crazy.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.737
I wouldn't put it that way
but, yeah.

40:23.804 --> 40:25.706
I was hoping that she might...

40:28.074 --> 40:29.809
...maybe you know.

40:32.478 --> 40:35.147
I hear her singing.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.951
She's very sad.

40:39.418 --> 40:43.757
Cynthia, I know how this sounds,

40:43.824 --> 40:45.291
but I think someone died there

40:45.358 --> 40:48.161
and she's trying
to communicate with me.

40:48.228 --> 40:51.764
Amber, listen to me.

40:51.831 --> 40:53.065
There's no such thing as ghosts.

40:53.132 --> 40:54.933
They don't exist.

40:55.001 --> 40:57.937
You live in a big old house,
and you live alone.

40:58.003 --> 41:00.272
Anyone with half an imagination
would experience the same.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.942
I know I would.

41:05.077 --> 41:08.748
There is someone
who may know something.

41:10.050 --> 41:15.355
But Amber, if anything did
happen, it's in the past.

41:15.422 --> 41:17.057
Dead and buried.

41:20.559 --> 41:22.061
Whatever is happening
can be explained.

41:22.128 --> 41:23.931
I'm sure of it.

41:34.340 --> 41:37.242
Father Lawrence?

41:37.309 --> 41:39.145
Afternoon Miss Waltz.

41:41.581 --> 41:44.317
How'd you know my name?

41:44.384 --> 41:47.487
The Lord sends many
an odd message.

41:47.554 --> 41:49.822
I'm only teasing dear.

41:49.889 --> 41:51.891
I heard an outsider
bought the Murphy place,

41:51.958 --> 41:53.960
and since I haven't seen ya
around...

41:55.094 --> 41:57.096
Well, you can just call me
Amber.

41:57.163 --> 41:58.231
Mind if we sit?

41:58.297 --> 42:00.099
Bad knees and all.

42:02.168 --> 42:05.605
Let me guess, you're here to...

42:05.672 --> 42:08.041
...save your soul
from eternal damnation.

42:09.208 --> 42:12.377
No, actually, um I was wondering
if you knew anything

42:12.445 --> 42:13.547
about my house?

42:14.914 --> 42:17.851
You think your house is haunted.

42:17.918 --> 42:20.119
I went to see Mrs. Murphy
earlier.

42:20.186 --> 42:21.321
It's miss.

42:21.387 --> 42:23.155
She never wed.

42:23.222 --> 42:26.259
She said something strange about
making Mr. Murphy...

42:26.326 --> 42:29.461
Oh, Arthur.

42:29.528 --> 42:32.130
I remember when he met
that poor girl.

42:32.197 --> 42:34.933
He put all his time,
energy and money into her.

42:35.001 --> 42:38.939
People thought he was crazy but,
he didn't care.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.877
In my eyes, he was a savior.

42:46.646 --> 42:51.118
And she was his whole world.

42:53.954 --> 42:56.256
He raised her as if she were
his own daughter.

42:56.322 --> 42:58.458
And then the gossiping began.

42:58.525 --> 43:01.059
You know how people are.

43:01.126 --> 43:04.563
Soon no one wanted anything to
do with either of them.

43:04.630 --> 43:06.098
And then one day...

43:07.500 --> 43:09.068
...he just left.

43:11.003 --> 43:13.405
Personally I think he was
overwhelmed

43:13.472 --> 43:14.574
by the pressure of...

43:17.110 --> 43:22.249
Well, some say he had more than
just a father's love for her.

43:24.050 --> 43:25.418
Imagine.

43:25.485 --> 43:29.555
No friends, no one to talk to,

43:29.621 --> 43:31.858
like being trapped
in your own mind...

43:33.626 --> 43:35.896
and now she is...

43:41.601 --> 43:43.503
You want some advice?

43:46.106 --> 43:47.607
Holy water.

43:47.673 --> 43:51.076
Um, no thank you.

43:51.143 --> 43:52.411
Ah, but I'm...

43:52.478 --> 43:55.948
A non-believer who happens to
believe in ghosts.

43:56.016 --> 43:58.718
You've never seen one,
have you?

43:58.784 --> 43:59.219
No.

43:59.284 --> 44:01.119
Never.

44:01.186 --> 44:02.621
Could be they don't like
the crucifix

44:02.688 --> 44:04.089
dangling around my neck.

44:07.193 --> 44:08.227
Well thank you, Father.

44:08.293 --> 44:10.230
You've been very helpful.

44:13.065 --> 44:15.000
Guilt Amber.

44:15.068 --> 44:17.638
You can't let your guilt hold
you back.

44:19.338 --> 44:20.907
What's his name?

44:22.141 --> 44:24.076
The fellow
you're running away from.

44:25.478 --> 44:27.680
I wasn't born yesterday.

44:27.746 --> 44:32.318
Young woman, such as yourself,
moves out here, for what?

44:34.054 --> 44:36.322
In one way or another you're
trying to run away

44:36.389 --> 44:37.224
from something.

44:38.592 --> 44:39.626
But you're filled with a guilt
that will drive you

44:39.693 --> 44:42.362
to your wits end
if you don't confront it.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.102
Ain't no ghosts.

44:49.168 --> 44:51.938
Just your worries driving you
out of your mind.

46:13.219 --> 46:14.320
Hello?

46:19.626 --> 46:20.560
Who are you?

46:25.664 --> 46:28.134
What do you want from me?

46:40.847 --> 46:43.450
I am not leaving this house!

47:54.554 --> 47:55.688
Hey.

47:55.755 --> 47:57.891
How'd everything go in town?

48:01.661 --> 48:02.161
Um.

48:02.228 --> 48:05.197
It's done.

48:05.264 --> 48:05.764
My symphony.

48:08.934 --> 48:11.871
I mean nearly...
sort of,

48:11.938 --> 48:15.675
it still needs a little bit of
finessing, but uh,

48:15.742 --> 48:17.477
I should be able
to mail it off soon.

48:20.445 --> 48:23.215
Oh god, they'll probably
want me to tour.

48:23.282 --> 48:24.916
But I don't think
I'm ready for that yet.

48:24.983 --> 48:27.652
What about your contract?

48:27.719 --> 48:30.355
Oh, it's the entertainment
business, Jim.

48:30.422 --> 48:33.225
They may own my work,
but not my soul.

48:35.661 --> 48:37.196
Hey Amber, uh,...

48:38.597 --> 48:40.500
...what do you say I take you
out to dinner tonight.

48:44.936 --> 48:45.471
I think it'll be...

48:45.538 --> 48:47.472
Good for us.

48:47.539 --> 48:50.242
For both of us.

48:50.309 --> 48:51.777
I really miss spending time
with you Amber.

48:51.844 --> 48:53.847
I barely get to see you anymore.

48:56.014 --> 48:57.682
We're together all the time.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.952
Yeah, but you're never here
with me.

49:00.018 --> 49:02.554
It's, it's this fucking thing!

49:02.621 --> 49:04.656
Is it more important than me?

49:04.724 --> 49:05.791
Than us?

49:05.858 --> 49:06.525
Mark, no!

49:06.592 --> 49:07.893
Don't, don't, don't!

49:07.960 --> 49:09.394
You think you're some lady
Beethoven or something!

49:10.463 --> 49:11.464
Amber?

49:12.731 --> 49:15.735
Oh, uh, dinner, right, um.

49:15.802 --> 49:17.670
That sounds...

49:17.737 --> 49:18.704
Let's, let's talk about that

49:18.771 --> 49:20.673
after I've mailed
everything off.

49:20.739 --> 49:21.607
Okay?

49:22.909 --> 49:24.610
Hey what happened in town?

49:24.677 --> 49:25.711
You never did tell me...

49:25.777 --> 49:27.579
Let's just drop it.

49:27.646 --> 49:29.315
I was wasting my time and,

49:29.382 --> 49:31.217
I don't want you bothering with
it either, okay?

49:33.119 --> 49:35.954
Look um, Jim, I appreciate
everything

49:36.021 --> 49:37.322
that you've done for me.

49:37.389 --> 49:41.894
But can you please stop trying
to take care of me.

49:43.628 --> 49:45.297
Yeah.

49:45.364 --> 49:46.431
Sure.

49:46.498 --> 49:48.000
No problem.

49:50.869 --> 49:52.971
Actually, no, it is a problem.

49:53.039 --> 49:55.608
Maybe I'm prying too much here
Amber,

49:55.675 --> 49:57.343
but I gotta be honest with you.

49:57.409 --> 49:59.711
I think this whole thing
is guilt.

49:59.778 --> 50:01.681
You've been blaming yourself
for what happened to Mark,

50:01.748 --> 50:03.581
and ya can't let go.

50:03.648 --> 50:05.851
You need to accept the fact that
he was a sick man,

50:05.918 --> 50:08.854
and that his actions were just
that, his actions,

50:08.920 --> 50:10.022
not yours.

50:19.931 --> 50:21.634
Thank you, Jim.

50:24.003 --> 50:26.706
You don't need to thank me,
Amber.

50:26.773 --> 50:29.608
You never need to thank me.

50:29.675 --> 50:31.678
Not if you knew how much I...

50:37.550 --> 50:38.884
Um.

50:38.951 --> 50:41.019
I'm sorry, Jim um,

50:41.086 --> 50:43.489
I think there's been
a bit of a misunderstanding.

50:46.092 --> 50:48.860
No, no I get it, I get it.

50:48.927 --> 50:50.730
My bad.

50:54.032 --> 50:55.567
See ya tomorrow, boss.

50:57.769 --> 51:00.373
Actually, Jim.

51:00.440 --> 51:03.009
You've done an
amazing job here, but.

51:04.577 --> 51:05.945
I really don't think that
there's much left for you

51:06.012 --> 51:06.980
to do here.

51:08.914 --> 51:11.416
I hope you can understand.

52:49.815 --> 52:51.717
Hello, Amber.

52:55.820 --> 52:58.557
I don't belong here!

55:08.853 --> 55:10.989
Left the piano I see.

55:11.056 --> 55:13.224
Impressive.

55:13.291 --> 55:16.228
Can't believe she parted
with it.

55:16.295 --> 55:18.097
Miss Murphy played?

55:18.164 --> 55:19.832
Exceptionally.

55:22.867 --> 55:25.136
Did you visit here often?

55:25.204 --> 55:27.406
Hmm, from time to time.

55:27.472 --> 55:30.675
But that was when Arthur
was still around.

55:30.742 --> 55:32.911
See, things changed
when he fell on hard times.

55:34.380 --> 55:36.316
To keep the farm,
he had to sell the piano.

55:37.717 --> 55:40.419
Poor girl was devastated.

55:40.485 --> 55:42.888
She loved to play it
ever so much.

55:45.990 --> 55:49.293
I'll never figure out
how she got it back.

55:49.360 --> 55:52.764
Must have pinched every penny
she made giving lessons,

55:52.831 --> 55:54.299
but she couldn't have been
making that much.

55:57.902 --> 56:00.338
One day she stopped
receiving me.

56:00.405 --> 56:02.173
Refused to answer the door.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.942
Just locked herself away,

56:04.009 --> 56:07.746
claiming she was hearing things,
seeing things.

56:09.347 --> 56:12.817
I realize now what was really
going on...

56:12.885 --> 56:17.089
...she was displaying the first
signs of her dementia.

56:17.155 --> 56:18.391
What if...

56:18.456 --> 56:20.993
What if she really was
experiencing something?

56:22.360 --> 56:25.330
Come on Amber,
you met the woman.

56:27.233 --> 56:28.967
Wait here.

56:42.547 --> 56:44.382
This is an old town Amber.

56:44.449 --> 56:45.851
Lots of history here.

56:48.186 --> 56:49.922
Some of it unsavoury.

56:51.523 --> 56:54.125
You told me Arthur ran away.

56:54.193 --> 56:55.828
What if he didn't?

56:55.894 --> 56:56.762
What if...

57:14.112 --> 57:15.079
Perhaps I should get started.

57:20.853 --> 57:23.055
Visit, we beseech
thee, O Lord, this dwelling,

57:23.121 --> 57:26.190
and drive far from it all snares
of the enemy;

57:26.257 --> 57:30.895
let thy holy angels dwell
herein, to preserve us in peace;

57:30.963 --> 57:32.932
and let thy blessing
be upon us forever.

57:34.233 --> 57:36.969
<i>Per Christum Dominum Nostrum.</i>

57:37.036 --> 57:38.704
Amen.

57:44.043 --> 57:44.943
That's it?

57:48.380 --> 57:50.782
This house...

57:50.849 --> 57:53.918
...it's far too big for one
person to live alone in.

57:53.985 --> 57:56.420
It needs to be filled
with the sounds of many,

57:56.487 --> 57:57.756
don't you think?

58:00.458 --> 58:02.193
I hope everything works out
for you,

58:02.260 --> 58:04.195
and that you find happiness
here.

58:04.262 --> 58:06.297
Thank you, Father.

58:06.364 --> 58:07.766
See you in church sometime?

58:08.867 --> 58:09.835
I know, I know.

58:09.902 --> 58:11.235
You're not a practicing
Catholic.

58:12.471 --> 58:14.173
Have a good day, Amber.

58:14.239 --> 58:15.440
I'll let myself out.

59:08.193 --> 59:10.463
Get away from there.

59:17.603 --> 59:19.238
Miko, you heard me.

59:51.637 --> 59:53.606
Hello?

1:00:02.414 --> 1:00:04.483
Where are you?

1:00:09.454 --> 1:00:11.590
Show yourself!

1:00:24.235 --> 1:00:27.138
What do you want from me?

1:01:09.313 --> 1:01:10.615
Who are you?

1:01:18.322 --> 1:01:18.889
Stay with me!

1:01:18.956 --> 1:01:20.058
Stay with me!

1:01:24.463 --> 1:01:26.332
You're a very lucky woman.

1:01:28.333 --> 1:01:30.936
Someone's watching over you.

1:01:32.603 --> 1:01:35.339
Jim.

1:01:35.407 --> 1:01:37.542
Where am I?

1:01:37.608 --> 1:01:39.478
Kalispell.

1:01:39.545 --> 1:01:41.347
Where else would you be?

1:01:43.481 --> 1:01:45.351
What were you doing
in the orchard?

1:01:51.456 --> 1:01:54.592
She was here, Jim,
she really was.

1:01:56.494 --> 1:02:00.231
She started singing right after
Father Lawrence and I

1:02:00.298 --> 1:02:01.766
did a blessing.

1:02:01.833 --> 1:02:04.636
Father Lawrence blessed
the house?

1:02:06.605 --> 1:02:08.206
Wait, um.

1:02:08.273 --> 1:02:10.142
What were you doing here?

1:02:11.643 --> 1:02:15.047
I just came by to pick up
my tools.

1:02:15.114 --> 1:02:18.817
Heard your scream,
and found you out cold.

1:02:18.884 --> 1:02:21.320
Lucky for you, I was here.

1:02:26.525 --> 1:02:30.528
I'm sorry, Amber,
I really wish I knew

1:02:30.596 --> 1:02:32.463
how I could help you...

1:02:32.530 --> 1:02:34.699
Leave.

1:02:34.766 --> 1:02:36.768
I've already told you.

1:02:36.835 --> 1:02:38.436
I don't want you here.

1:02:38.503 --> 1:02:41.806
And I don't need you here.

1:02:41.873 --> 1:02:42.741
Leave.

1:02:44.643 --> 1:02:46.644
What the hell is wrong
with you Amber?

1:02:46.711 --> 1:02:49.081
There's nothing wrong with me.

1:02:49.148 --> 1:02:50.416
Oh really?

1:02:50.483 --> 1:02:51.182
Cause it seems like
there's a whole lot of shit

1:02:51.250 --> 1:02:52.784
going on in your head.

1:02:52.851 --> 1:02:54.719
Key words being:
in your head.

1:02:58.389 --> 1:03:02.259
Oh, you are exactly like
the rest of them.

1:03:02.327 --> 1:03:05.630
Always expecting more than
I am willing to give.

1:03:05.697 --> 1:03:07.766
You don't understand
what it's like to live

1:03:07.833 --> 1:03:09.434
for something great.

1:03:11.235 --> 1:03:15.373
I can't give myself to you,
or any other man.

1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:20.112
My devotion is to my music,
and nothing else.

1:03:22.713 --> 1:03:24.516
Do you hear me?

1:03:24.583 --> 1:03:26.318
Nothing.

1:03:30.655 --> 1:03:32.157
You should leave now.

1:03:32.224 --> 1:03:33.892
No, I think you should leave,
Amber.

1:03:33.958 --> 1:03:35.226
Just listen to yourself.

1:03:35.293 --> 1:03:36.027
This place, this place is
driving you fucking crazy!

1:03:36.094 --> 1:03:38.496
I am not fucking crazy!

1:03:40.932 --> 1:03:44.536
My head has never been
this clear.

1:03:44.603 --> 1:03:48.340
This house is the perfect
place for me.

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:49.673
I can be alone.

1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:50.541
And my work...

1:03:51.710 --> 1:03:52.845
it's the best that
it's ever been.

1:03:52.911 --> 1:03:55.815
I mean it practically writes
itself now.

1:03:58.483 --> 1:04:00.685
Fuck.

1:04:00.751 --> 1:04:03.088
After all I did for you?

1:04:04.590 --> 1:04:07.259
This is my house, Jim.

1:04:07.326 --> 1:04:08.760
My house.

1:04:08.827 --> 1:04:11.496
You, you're just the help.

1:04:11.563 --> 1:04:13.365
No, you were the help.

1:04:16.467 --> 1:04:18.303
Now go.

1:04:24.809 --> 1:04:26.677
Fine Amber.

1:04:26.744 --> 1:04:28.512
Have it your way.

1:07:36.835 --> 1:07:39.037
I'm very happy here.

1:07:39.103 --> 1:07:41.405
I completed my symphony.

1:07:41.472 --> 1:07:44.007
Mailed it off a few weeks ago.

1:07:44.074 --> 1:07:46.877
Still haven't heard back,
but other than that

1:07:46.945 --> 1:07:49.047
thing's are going great.

1:07:49.114 --> 1:07:50.981
<i>And you're sleeping well?</i>

1:07:51.048 --> 1:07:53.684
<i>You never picked up that
prescription.</i>

1:07:53.751 --> 1:07:56.587
Yeah um, had a lot going on.

1:07:57.722 --> 1:08:00.659
Everything seems
to have sorted itself out.

1:08:01.827 --> 1:08:03.329
It's funny how that happens.

1:08:04.996 --> 1:08:07.030
<i>Amber?</i>

1:08:07.097 --> 1:08:09.000
Yes, Doctor Pearl?

1:08:11.302 --> 1:08:14.672
<i>We both know things don't
just sort themselves out like that.</i>

1:08:14.739 --> 1:08:17.609
I know, but I feel really great.

1:08:17.676 --> 1:08:20.579
<i>There's a reason
why I prescribed those for you.</i>

1:08:22.613 --> 1:08:25.182
<i>You're out of your
fucking mind.</i>

1:08:25.250 --> 1:08:27.353
What did you just say?

1:08:29.087 --> 1:08:31.090
<i>You're crazy, Amber.</i>

1:08:33.757 --> 1:08:35.527
<i>You've always been crazy.</i>

1:08:42.234 --> 1:08:44.636
Why the hell would you say
that to me?

1:09:00.051 --> 1:09:01.886
Doctor Pearl?

1:09:01.953 --> 1:09:04.956
<i>No, it's me, Jim.</i>

1:09:05.023 --> 1:09:08.460
<i>I was just wondering if you
mailed your symphony</i> off yet.

1:09:08.527 --> 1:09:09.060
I did.

1:09:09.127 --> 1:09:10.795
A few weeks ago.

1:09:10.862 --> 1:09:11.762
<i>Oh great.</i>

1:09:11.829 --> 1:09:14.097
<i>Congratulations Amber.</i>

1:09:14.164 --> 1:09:16.068
<i>Guess you're free
to have dinner now.</i>

1:09:18.936 --> 1:09:20.005
<i>Amber?</i>

1:09:20.070 --> 1:09:21.872
- <i>You still there?</i>
- Hmm?

1:09:24.408 --> 1:09:25.710
Yes I'm still here, Jim.

1:09:27.578 --> 1:09:29.180
<i>Look, I admit I got a
little sensitive the last time</i>

1:09:29.247 --> 1:09:34.018
<i>I saw you, but we had something
special going on between us</i>

1:09:34.085 --> 1:09:38.489
<i>and, well, I feel like
we owe it to ourselves</i>

1:09:38.556 --> 1:09:40.757
<i>maybe give this a go.</i>

1:09:40.824 --> 1:09:43.494
- I'm hanging up now, Jim.
- <i>No, wait, uh!</i>

1:09:43.561 --> 1:09:44.496
<i>Just hear me out, Amber.</i>

1:09:44.563 --> 1:09:45.898
<i>Please!</i>

1:09:45.963 --> 1:09:47.998
<i>You have no idea
what I'd do for you.</i>

1:09:48.065 --> 1:09:50.835
<i>We'll be together,
and then</i>

1:09:50.902 --> 1:09:52.171
<i>I'll show you.</i>

1:09:54.271 --> 1:09:56.608
<i>You just wait and see.</i>

1:10:25.069 --> 1:10:26.904
Amber?

1:10:36.948 --> 1:10:38.684
Amber?

1:10:42.854 --> 1:10:44.690
Amber?

1:11:30.801 --> 1:11:32.135
Oh, no.

1:11:59.997 --> 1:12:02.900
<i>You've had too
much to drink again.</i>

1:12:07.104 --> 1:12:07.904
No.

1:12:07.971 --> 1:12:09.139
Where are you?

1:12:09.207 --> 1:12:10.709
<i>I've come home.</i>

1:12:13.377 --> 1:12:16.014
This is my home, Jim!

1:12:16.081 --> 1:12:17.248
Mine!

1:12:17.315 --> 1:12:19.216
<i>This is our house, Amber.</i>

1:12:19.283 --> 1:12:22.786
<i>It's always been our house.</i>

1:12:22.854 --> 1:12:25.356
<i>You live in it,
and I take care of it.</i>

1:12:25.422 --> 1:12:26.791
<i>That was the deal!</i>

1:12:26.858 --> 1:12:28.126
No.

1:12:28.193 --> 1:12:30.261
Jim, I think you need help.

1:12:30.328 --> 1:12:32.063
<i>You think I need help?</i>

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:34.297
<i>You think I need help?</i>

1:12:34.364 --> 1:12:37.135
<i>You're the one
that's fucked up, Amber.</i>

1:12:37.202 --> 1:12:39.270
<i>Look what you do to people.</i>

1:12:39.337 --> 1:12:41.939
<i>You used me,
just like you used Mark.</i>

1:12:42.006 --> 1:12:43.140
Stop it!

1:12:43.207 --> 1:12:45.343
- Stop it!
- <i>Oh, poor Marky-Mark.</i>

1:12:45.409 --> 1:12:46.810
It's not true!

1:12:46.877 --> 1:12:48.045
It's not true!

1:12:48.113 --> 1:12:49.213
<i>I really wish it weren't.</i>

1:12:51.949 --> 1:12:55.086
<i>Then none of us would be
suffering with this!</i>

1:12:57.988 --> 1:12:59.122
No.

1:12:59.189 --> 1:13:00.190
Jim?

1:13:00.257 --> 1:13:01.826
Jim?

1:13:29.787 --> 1:13:31.988
Oh, my God.

1:13:41.565 --> 1:13:43.134
Father Lawrence!

1:13:45.336 --> 1:13:48.139
I need you help.

1:13:48.206 --> 1:13:50.842
You can say that again, Amber.

1:13:50.908 --> 1:13:53.877
Excuse me?

1:13:53.944 --> 1:13:55.947
Father Lawrence?

1:14:17.368 --> 1:14:20.338
Get off the road,
you crazy bitch!

1:15:02.947 --> 1:15:04.149
Hello?

1:15:07.318 --> 1:15:08.887
Cynthia?

1:15:11.221 --> 1:15:12.923
It's Amber.

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.462
I need your help.

1:15:39.984 --> 1:15:41.453
Amber!

1:15:42.953 --> 1:15:44.922
Have you been waiting long?

1:15:45.989 --> 1:15:48.992
Here to save your soul
from eternal damnation?

1:16:11.548 --> 1:16:12.550
Quiet.

1:16:12.617 --> 1:16:13.717
You're misbehaving.

1:16:13.784 --> 1:16:15.353
I don't want to have
to tell you again.

1:16:17.188 --> 1:16:17.954
Ah.

1:16:18.021 --> 1:16:18.890
No!

1:16:18.957 --> 1:16:20.124
No!

1:16:20.190 --> 1:16:21.125
No!

1:16:21.192 --> 1:16:23.127
Ah!

1:16:26.229 --> 1:16:28.064
Open up or I'll call the police!

1:16:28.131 --> 1:16:29.934
No!

1:16:31.034 --> 1:16:32.036
Go ahead.

1:16:32.103 --> 1:16:34.038
Who's gonna believe you?

1:16:34.104 --> 1:16:35.071
Yeah.

1:16:35.139 --> 1:16:36.539
Mind your own business.

1:16:36.606 --> 1:16:38.275
I had it coming.

1:17:27.557 --> 1:17:29.460
<i>911 what's your emergency?</i>

1:17:29.527 --> 1:17:30.895
I think there's someone's
in my house.

1:17:30.962 --> 1:17:32.630
<i>What's the address, please?</i>

1:17:32.697 --> 1:17:35.432
12405 Figment Road.

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:36.667
Hurry, please.

1:17:36.734 --> 1:17:38.936
<i>Right away, Miss Waltz.</i>

1:17:40.704 --> 1:17:42.573
How did you know my name?

1:18:08.498 --> 1:18:10.067
Hi, I'm Cynthia Miller.

1:18:10.134 --> 1:18:11.769
Here to save
your soul from eternal damnation.

1:18:11.836 --> 1:18:14.105
I'm here to show you around.

1:18:14.171 --> 1:18:15.638
Mind if we sit?

1:18:15.706 --> 1:18:17.309
Bad knees and all.

1:18:22.846 --> 1:18:25.215
Hello.

1:18:28.586 --> 1:18:30.554
I know who you are.

1:18:30.621 --> 1:18:32.623
You're pretty.

1:18:40.631 --> 1:18:42.600
Hello, Amber.

1:18:42.667 --> 1:18:44.336
How's my girl?

1:18:45.735 --> 1:18:47.570
Who are you?

1:18:47.637 --> 1:18:49.606
Where's Jim?

1:18:49.673 --> 1:18:51.408
Sit down, Amber.

1:18:51.475 --> 1:18:52.442
Where is he?

1:18:52.510 --> 1:18:53.344
Sit down.

1:18:53.411 --> 1:18:54.444
No!

1:18:54.511 --> 1:18:55.612
Where's Jim?

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:57.048
Stop fucking around.

1:18:57.114 --> 1:18:59.449
It's over.

1:19:00.917 --> 1:19:05.189
Your ability of self-delusion
is remarkable, Amber.

1:19:10.627 --> 1:19:12.262
What's wrong?

1:19:12.896 --> 1:19:16.100
Forget to take your meds?

1:19:16.167 --> 1:19:18.202
You have quite a mind, Amber.

1:19:18.269 --> 1:19:21.338
I loved your friends.

1:19:21.404 --> 1:19:25.442
The realtor, the priest.

1:19:25.510 --> 1:19:28.546
You have a wild imagination!

1:19:28.613 --> 1:19:32.615
And your vision of a perfect
world...

1:19:32.682 --> 1:19:35.519
...fantastic!

1:19:35.586 --> 1:19:38.423
You're a real dreamer,
you know that?

1:19:39.856 --> 1:19:42.793
Only now it's time to wake up.

1:19:45.695 --> 1:19:48.800
Your mind's crumbling, Amber.

1:19:51.335 --> 1:19:53.737
No more ghosts.

1:19:53.804 --> 1:19:56.539
No more music.

1:19:56.606 --> 1:19:59.043
You're crazy, Amber.

1:20:02.345 --> 1:20:03.781
Where are you going, Amber?

1:20:04.849 --> 1:20:07.217
Where the hell are you off to?

1:20:09.420 --> 1:20:10.520
Who are you!

1:20:10.587 --> 1:20:13.590
You know who I am!

1:20:13.658 --> 1:20:15.426
Ain't no ghosts.

1:20:15.493 --> 1:20:17.595
Just your worries driving you
out of your mind.

1:20:17.662 --> 1:20:20.698
Oh dear, I frightened you.

1:20:22.733 --> 1:20:24.135
After all I did for you?

1:20:24.202 --> 1:20:26.302
I look like you in my dreams.

1:20:26.369 --> 1:20:27.270
You're confusing her.

1:20:27.337 --> 1:20:30.240
I don't belong here!

1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:31.336
Morning, boss.

1:21:35.006 --> 1:21:40.411
Little late, I know, but I'll
make it up to you later.

1:21:44.849 --> 1:21:46.617
You alright?

1:21:46.684 --> 1:21:48.219
You look kinda spooked?

1:21:50.622 --> 1:21:52.323
I think there's something really
wrong with me, Jim.

1:21:54.992 --> 1:21:56.927
You're just scared, Amber.

1:21:56.993 --> 1:21:59.496
You're just scared.

1:21:59.563 --> 1:22:03.667
Once you let go of your guilt
and accept your fate,

1:22:03.734 --> 1:22:04.535
all this will feel...

1:22:04.601 --> 1:22:06.502
What are you talking about?

1:22:06.569 --> 1:22:07.438
Fate?

1:22:11.809 --> 1:22:13.578
The deal.

1:22:19.716 --> 1:22:21.585
Our deal.

1:22:23.688 --> 1:22:26.190
I've come to collect Amber.

1:22:27.725 --> 1:22:29.793
It's not funny, Jim.

1:22:29.859 --> 1:22:32.595
Whatever, whatever you're doing,
it's not funny!

1:22:32.662 --> 1:22:34.530
Why doncha you sit down?

1:22:34.597 --> 1:22:36.466
Play something for me.

1:22:57.587 --> 1:23:01.625
I gave you everything you
wanted, didn't I?

1:23:06.896 --> 1:23:09.565
I want my piano.

1:23:09.632 --> 1:23:11.702
My piano.

1:23:11.769 --> 1:23:13.204
Is that all you want?

1:23:13.270 --> 1:23:17.242
I want to be a famous pianist
and get far away from here.

1:23:18.408 --> 1:23:19.842
You know what that'll cost you.

1:24:13.898 --> 1:24:16.434
And that would be the patient
in question.

1:24:17.835 --> 1:24:20.738
Nurse, would you please
tend to Amber?

1:24:20.805 --> 1:24:22.506
Right away, Dr. Pearl.

1:24:22.573 --> 1:24:24.108
Now, as I told you,

1:24:24.175 --> 1:24:26.510
this acute is rather a peculiar
case, Dr. Feldman.

1:24:26.577 --> 1:24:28.479
Peculiar even for this
institution.

1:24:40.858 --> 1:24:44.094
Hi, I'm Cynthia Miller.

1:24:44.161 --> 1:24:46.331
I'm here to show you around.

1:24:47.931 --> 1:24:50.001
Oh dear, I frightened you.

1:24:54.505 --> 1:24:55.739
Let me guess.

1:24:55.805 --> 1:24:59.009
Here to save your soul from
eternal damnation.

1:25:01.545 --> 1:25:02.813
Mind if we sit?

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.649
Bad knees and all.

1:25:06.884 --> 1:25:09.886
Being a famous pianist
and composer,

1:25:09.953 --> 1:25:11.554
her music was everything to her,

1:25:11.622 --> 1:25:14.525
and she just locked herself
away.

1:25:14.591 --> 1:25:18.594
Imagine, no friends, no family,
no one to talk to,

1:25:18.662 --> 1:25:20.564
just her and her music.

1:25:20.631 --> 1:25:22.733
She was working on this
particular piece

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:26.470
when the pressure
became too much.

1:25:26.537 --> 1:25:28.972
This was the last thing
she was able to compose

1:25:29.038 --> 1:25:32.108
before regressing into
the infantile state

1:25:32.176 --> 1:25:33.478
you see her in now.

1:25:34.811 --> 1:25:38.448
We've tried every treatment,
but she doesn't respond.

1:25:38.515 --> 1:25:42.185
The only thing that brings her
any solace is that recording.

1:25:42.252 --> 1:25:46.489
She listens to it all day,
everyday.

1:25:46.556 --> 1:25:49.493
Over and over and over again.

1:25:51.127 --> 1:25:54.564
She's living in her own hell.

1:25:54.631 --> 1:25:56.032
You're so pretty.

1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:58.035
I look like you in my dreams.

1:26:05.208 --> 1:26:08.244
Why don't I leave you two alone?

1:26:08.311 --> 1:26:10.782
Give you some time to get
acquainted.

1:26:19.689 --> 1:26:22.024
Come dear, you haven't finished
your lunch.

1:26:43.646 --> 1:26:45.850
Hi, I'm Dr. Feldman.

1:26:48.118 --> 1:26:50.654
We're gonna be seeing a lot of
each other.

1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:54.590
I just want you to know that
I'll always be at your service.

1:26:54.658 --> 1:26:58.662
Anything you need, all you
have to do is ask.

1:26:58.729 --> 1:27:00.498
Deal?

1:27:03.766 --> 1:27:05.001
Well,
sounds like the arrangement

1:27:05.069 --> 1:27:07.938
was to your satisfaction.

1:27:08.005 --> 1:27:10.073
I didn't know
what I was doing.

1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.776
No lie.

1:27:12.842 --> 1:27:14.679
I don't belong here.

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:20.818
But uh, I gave you everything
you wanted.

1:27:21.952 --> 1:27:24.855
Didn't I, Amber?

1:28:08.198 --> 1:28:09.667
Amber?

1:28:11.135 --> 1:28:13.538
Oh dear, I frightened you.

1:28:15.338 --> 1:28:17.140
I'm Cynthia Miller.

1:28:17.207 --> 1:28:18.307
I'm here to show you around.

1:28:18.375 --> 1:28:19.876
Nice to finally meet you.

1:28:19.943 --> 1:28:21.078
Oh the pleasure's all mine.
