WEBVTT

00:04.729 --> 00:06.453
Castle: So, what do you think?
This feels different, doesn't it?

00:06.473 --> 00:07.368
What does?

00:07.388 --> 00:09.400
Rolling up to a crime
scene as a married couple.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.934
We're like Nick and Nora Charles.

00:10.968 --> 00:12.703
Ooh, like "McMillan & Wife."

00:12.737 --> 00:14.805
- "Hart to Hart."
- "Turner & Hooch."

00:14.839 --> 00:16.373
Turner and Hooch aren't even married.

00:16.408 --> 00:18.341
Yeah,
but you still remind me a little of Hooch.

00:20.512 --> 00:23.179
[Camera shutter clicks]

00:23.214 --> 00:25.950
So, uh, morning blend?

00:25.970 --> 00:27.317
- Did this just happen?
- Ryan: Yeah.

00:27.351 --> 00:28.769
Jogger found him about an hour ago.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.420
Lanie: Which was about the time he died.

00:30.454 --> 00:32.789
Needless to say,
pretty obvious what killed him.

00:32.823 --> 00:34.323
Gunshot wound to the head.

00:34.343 --> 00:35.843
"Him" being Paul Reeves out of queens.

00:35.893 --> 00:37.094
We're running down next of kin.

00:37.128 --> 00:38.862
- Anyone hear the shot?
- No, and there's no video coverage

00:38.896 --> 00:40.264
in this area of the park.

00:40.298 --> 00:41.665
The killer probably knew that.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.867
Took Reeves' phone, cash from his wallet,

00:43.901 --> 00:45.162
and probably waltzed right out of here.

00:45.182 --> 00:47.237
- Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
- Well, there's no signs of struggle.

00:47.271 --> 00:49.505
If this was a mugging and
he didn't put up a fight,

00:49.540 --> 00:52.364
why risk shooting him,
especially in broad daylight?

00:53.124 --> 00:55.394
Singed fabric.

00:55.414 --> 00:57.881
Nobody heard anything because
the killer used a backpack

00:57.915 --> 00:59.882
or cloth to muffle the shot.

00:59.916 --> 01:02.184
And then took the victim's phone and cash

01:02.219 --> 01:03.786
to throw us off track.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.636
This wasn't a mugging.

01:05.656 --> 01:07.390
This was a deliberate murder.

01:07.957 --> 01:10.192
That just doesn't make sense.

01:10.919 --> 01:13.211
Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.

01:13.231 --> 01:14.997
Well, how much do you know
about your brother's life?

01:15.031 --> 01:17.199
- Were you close?
- Very close.

01:17.234 --> 01:21.003
In fact, Paul had been staying at my place
for the past month.

01:21.037 --> 01:24.946
He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.

01:24.966 --> 01:27.042
Was having coffee in the
park something he did often?

01:27.077 --> 01:28.844
He never went to the park.

01:28.879 --> 01:30.646
He hardly ever left the office.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.848
- Paul was a complete workaholic.
- And what did he do, exactly?

01:33.883 --> 01:36.985
He was an investigator for the government,
the G.A.O.

01:37.019 --> 01:39.020
I don't know much more than that.

01:39.054 --> 01:41.657
He really couldn't discuss his job.

01:42.566 --> 01:45.823
Was he having any troubles
at work that you're aware of?

01:46.041 --> 01:50.819
Not trouble exactly, but...
Last night, we had a beer.

01:50.839 --> 01:55.085
Paul said a crucial meeting came up
that he was worried about.

01:55.105 --> 01:57.490
What kind of a meeting? I mean w-with whom?

01:57.510 --> 01:59.841
He didn't say,
but he'd got a disturbing call

01:59.875 --> 02:01.676
from someone involved in one of his cases.

02:01.710 --> 02:05.112
And he said... that meeting...

02:05.146 --> 02:08.023
I think that was supposed
to happen this morning.

02:09.584 --> 02:11.118
I-I'm sorry, but if he had a meeting,

02:11.152 --> 02:12.753
he never mentioned anything to me,

02:12.788 --> 02:14.755
though I suppose that wasn't unusual.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.358
I gave him a lot of latitude.
Paul was my top investigator.

02:17.392 --> 02:19.293
What exactly did Paul investigate?

02:19.328 --> 02:20.394
We're a federal agency.

02:20.429 --> 02:22.796
G.A.O. Evaluates government
programs and contracts

02:22.831 --> 02:25.750
to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.868
Like defense contractors
billing 500 bucks for a hammer.

02:27.902 --> 02:30.871
Yes,
though Paul was in the healthcare division.

02:30.905 --> 02:32.439
He oversaw hospitals and medical services

02:32.473 --> 02:35.214
with government contracts...
that sort of thing.

02:35.234 --> 02:38.453
So if someone was fleecing Uncle Sam,
he could cancel their contracts?

02:38.473 --> 02:41.654
He wrote reports that could
produce that result, yes.

02:42.059 --> 02:45.385
Did anyone ever pressure Paul
to back off a report or investigation?

02:45.419 --> 02:47.754
It doesn't work that way.
We're an independent body, so...

02:47.788 --> 02:48.855
Be that as it may,

02:48.889 --> 02:51.725
we need the files of all
his active investigations.

02:51.759 --> 02:53.727
Beckett:
Paul Reeves had over 20 open cases,

02:53.761 --> 02:57.296
and he was taking on some major players...

02:57.331 --> 02:59.899
a hospital chain that defrauded medicare,

02:59.933 --> 03:02.301
a-a lab at Latham Pharmaceuticals

03:02.336 --> 03:04.570
cited for lax storage practices,

03:04.604 --> 03:07.773
and a company that sold the V.A.
defective medical equipment.

03:07.807 --> 03:09.475
I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.

03:09.509 --> 03:10.576
Yeah, well, what else is new?

03:10.610 --> 03:14.012
Consider this...
Paul uncovers a nefarious scandal

03:14.046 --> 03:16.782
rife with corruption and
financial skullduggery

03:16.816 --> 03:18.817
in connection with a federal contract,

03:18.852 --> 03:22.020
but with millions of dollars at stake,
the greedy contractor,

03:22.054 --> 03:24.823
determined to stay latched
onto the federal teat,

03:24.858 --> 03:27.259
lures Paul into a meeting in the park

03:27.293 --> 03:28.793
where he has an assassin silence him.

03:28.827 --> 03:31.496
Thus, Paul's findings never come to light.

03:32.532 --> 03:36.834
And I don't suppose that you have a
particular case of Paul's in mind, do you?

03:36.869 --> 03:40.005
Or proof? Or suspects?

03:40.039 --> 03:43.308
No, but I will once you identify
who met Paul at the park.

03:43.342 --> 03:45.309
I might be a step closer to that.

03:45.343 --> 03:46.944
Do you remember how
Paul's brother mentioned

03:46.978 --> 03:49.034
that a "meeting" had just come up?

03:49.054 --> 03:52.049
Well, I looked into Paul's phone
calls for the last 48 hours.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.284
One of them stood out...

03:53.318 --> 03:58.322
an incoming call to his office
at 11:04 yesterday morning.

03:58.356 --> 04:00.190
Call lasted less than a minute,

04:00.225 --> 04:02.192
and I traced it to a pay
phone on the lower east side.

04:02.227 --> 04:03.627
Try and find out who made that call.

04:03.661 --> 04:04.995
Yeah.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.531
Tory:
This is street-cam video of the pay phone.

04:07.565 --> 04:08.999
11:04 yesterday morning...

04:09.034 --> 04:10.968
this is the man who called Paul Reeves.

04:11.002 --> 04:14.305
Tory ran the image and
got a match on his face.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.576
Jared Stone...
misdemeanor computer trespassing?

04:19.610 --> 04:20.976
Otherwise known as hacking.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.012
Stone was an occupy Wall Street activist

04:23.047 --> 04:25.749
who hacked into a major bank,
releasing their e-mails,

04:25.783 --> 04:28.341
which reflected poorly on
their business practices.

04:28.361 --> 04:30.153
So why would a hacker like Jared Stone

04:30.187 --> 04:31.755
kill a G.A.O. investigator?

04:31.789 --> 04:34.523
He wouldn't.
That story doesn't make any sense.

04:34.558 --> 04:35.358
But this one does.

04:35.392 --> 04:37.360
Using his vaunted hacking skills,

04:37.394 --> 04:39.996
Jared Stone is the one who
uncovered the nefarious scandal.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.998
So we're back to a nefarious scandal?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.566
Yes, see,
he wants to blow the lid off a scandal,

04:43.600 --> 04:48.904
so who better to call
than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves?

04:48.939 --> 04:53.108
Because... wait for it...
Jared Stone is a whistle-blower.

04:53.142 --> 04:54.743
And Paul Reeves was murdered

04:54.778 --> 04:56.612
because of what Jared Stone told him,

04:56.646 --> 04:59.615
which... which actually means
he could be in danger now.

04:59.649 --> 05:01.083
You have to admit, Castle's theory is...

05:01.117 --> 05:02.184
surprisingly logical.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.720
Yes, and it's conveniently
unburdened by evidence.

05:04.754 --> 05:06.554
Nevertheless,
let's bring Jared Stone in for questioning,

05:06.589 --> 05:09.091
and let's take a look at the
video footage of that pay phone

05:09.125 --> 05:10.292
for the past two weeks.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.861
If Jared Stone talked to anyone,
I want to know who it was.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.429
Yo, we may have an address on Jared Stone.

05:14.464 --> 05:15.530
I ran his e-mails.

05:15.564 --> 05:17.699
He rented a place on the
lower west off Craigslist.

05:17.733 --> 05:20.068
- Go.
- Yeah, okay.

05:20.103 --> 05:23.070
Esposito: So,
what's going on with married life, huh?

05:23.105 --> 05:24.772
How is that... the whole family thing?

05:24.807 --> 05:29.043
Sarah Grace, she's...
she's growing up, changing so fast.

05:29.077 --> 05:32.113
Just trying to hold on to every second.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.783
Hey, what kind of dad do you think I'd be?

05:35.818 --> 05:37.084
You'd be great.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.286
Even growing up with no role model?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.922
Well, you know, the thing of it is,

05:41.956 --> 05:44.125
is that you know what it's
like not having a father.

05:44.159 --> 05:46.714
You'd make sure your
kid never felt that way.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.781
You and Lanie... Hmm?

05:51.801 --> 05:55.569
No. She likes things how they are.

05:55.603 --> 05:58.772
But, you know,
maybe I'm ready for more than that,

05:58.806 --> 06:01.642
you know what I'm saying?
Move forward. Huh.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.178
Hey, you hear that? That sound?

06:05.212 --> 06:07.180
No. What sound?

06:07.214 --> 06:09.082
It's my biological clock ticking.

06:09.116 --> 06:10.784
Tick, tock, tick.

06:10.818 --> 06:12.685
[Laughs] [Sighs]

06:12.719 --> 06:14.687
We were having a genuine,
honest moment here,

06:14.721 --> 06:16.589
and you had to ruin it by being a jackass.

06:16.623 --> 06:18.589
Hold on, hold on. Slow down, slow down.

06:19.493 --> 06:21.094
That's Jared Stone.

06:28.069 --> 06:29.101
Hang tight here.

06:29.135 --> 06:30.670
I'll follow him on foot,
make sure we don't lose him.

06:30.704 --> 06:33.472
[Car door opens, closes]

06:33.506 --> 06:37.176
[Indistinct talking over P.A.]

06:43.850 --> 06:45.384
[Cellphone rings]

06:45.418 --> 06:46.318
[Beep] Hey, bro.

06:46.352 --> 06:47.986
Yeah, I followed him down to the subway.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.154
I'm looking for him now.

06:49.189 --> 06:50.289
What, you lost him?

06:50.323 --> 06:53.225
No, I didn't lose him.
I just don't have visual contact.

06:53.259 --> 06:55.561
That's kind of splitting hairs, isn't it?
Look, I-I'll head down there, and...

06:55.595 --> 06:58.630
No, no, no. You stay there.
I'll... wait, I see him. He's at my 12.

06:59.582 --> 07:01.200
Yeah, he's moving fast.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.735
He's scared, like someone's after him.

07:03.769 --> 07:05.403
If someone is,
you'd better get to him before they do.

07:05.437 --> 07:07.639
Whoever killed Reeves
may be gunning for Stone.

07:07.673 --> 07:09.841
He's boarding the 7th Ave. Express.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.010
[Train beeps]

07:12.044 --> 07:14.045
All right, I'm on the train with Stone.

07:19.612 --> 07:21.185
You're holding an uncapped marker,

07:21.220 --> 07:24.255
and you're telling me you were not about
to tag this subway car?

07:24.289 --> 07:26.424
Yes. I-I mean no.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.159
I need to see some identification.

07:28.193 --> 07:29.794
I'm gonna have to write you up for this.

07:29.814 --> 07:32.597
Jared Stone? Hey.

07:33.236 --> 07:34.999
You're not in trouble, bro, but, uh...

07:35.033 --> 07:37.356
Look, I'm just here to talk to you.

07:38.269 --> 07:39.169
Don't! [Gun cocks]

07:39.203 --> 07:41.238
[People gasp]

07:41.811 --> 07:43.809
Put your gun on the ground!

07:44.921 --> 07:46.910
Now!

07:55.219 --> 07:56.219
[Air hisses]

07:58.957 --> 08:00.423
Put your gun on the ground now.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.425
Do it.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.499
Kick it over to me.

08:14.597 --> 08:15.872
Step back.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.475
Nobody else move.

08:19.509 --> 08:20.677
Nobody's moving, man.

08:20.711 --> 08:22.798
All right, I just came here to talk to you.
I'm on your side.

08:22.818 --> 08:25.881
No, you're a blunt instrument,
a tool of the one percent.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.283
Look, nobody's hurt yet,

08:27.317 --> 08:29.151
so this is just a big misunderstanding.

08:30.047 --> 08:32.650
So why don't you lower that weapon,
and we can walk right out of here?

08:32.669 --> 08:35.023
- Oh, is that really possible?
- It is, yeah.

08:35.058 --> 08:37.575
You just have to put the gun down, Jared.

08:41.164 --> 08:43.698
What the hell is that?
Are you on the phone?

08:45.334 --> 08:47.468
Everybody, shut off your
phones and get the ground now!

Stay down, don't move,

09:02.770 --> 09:04.830
This cannot be happening.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.832
Please, look, don't do this.

09:07.852 --> 09:10.826
- Okay? don't hurt my wife.
- Or the rest of us. Let's be inclusive.

09:10.846 --> 09:13.189
Hey, everybody just stay calm, all right?

09:13.494 --> 09:14.611
We're all gonna be fine.

come over the intercom yet?

Well, maybe he... shh!

You feel that? That's movement.

e-evacuating.

09:32.742 --> 09:34.772
How do they know?

09:36.211 --> 09:38.712
- Who were you on the phone with?
- Just a friend, man.

09:38.732 --> 09:41.889
Oh, what kind of friend?
Was it another cop?

09:41.909 --> 09:43.632

Yeah, he was a... he was NYPD,
but that doesn't mean anything.

09:47.623 --> 09:48.891
Okay, shut up.

09:48.925 --> 09:50.458
Okay, everybody just stop talking, okay?

09:50.493 --> 09:52.828
I got to... think.

09:54.798 --> 09:56.765
He took my service weapon.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.061
How did I let him do that?

10:00.265 --> 10:03.438
Hey, it could happen to anybody, okay?

10:03.913 --> 10:06.874
I'm Javier, Javier Esposito.

10:08.611 --> 10:09.911
[Clears throat] Jared?

10:09.945 --> 10:11.864
May I call you Jared?

10:12.247 --> 10:16.818
Grant Gerber, salesman by trade,
which means I'm a listener.

10:16.852 --> 10:19.887
I listen and learn what people
want so I can give it to them.

10:19.922 --> 10:22.256
Let me do that for you, Jared.

10:22.977 --> 10:25.159
I want to help you get what you want.

10:26.253 --> 10:28.262
I think you'll get your chance.

10:31.794 --> 10:33.400
I've just been informed that Jared Stone,

10:33.435 --> 10:35.602
a person of interest in
the Paul Reeves case,

10:35.637 --> 10:38.605
drew a gun on a subway and took hostages,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.507
including Detective Esposito.

10:40.542 --> 10:41.408
At this point, it's not clear why...

10:41.443 --> 10:44.144
Hey, if anybody can handle it, Espo can.

10:44.178 --> 10:45.312
Or what his agenda is...

10:45.347 --> 10:47.514
But why would Stone take hostages?

10:47.549 --> 10:50.083
Right now our sole
priority is to gather any

10:50.117 --> 10:52.252
and all information on Jared Stone

10:52.286 --> 10:54.087
so the hostage-rescue team

10:54.121 --> 10:55.922
will know who we're dealing with.

10:55.957 --> 10:59.692
All intel comes to me so that I
can forward it directly to HRT.

10:59.727 --> 11:02.490
[Siren wails] They should
be on the scene right now.

11:06.064 --> 11:07.200

- Yes, sir.

11:07.235 --> 11:09.034
Captain Bigelow, HRT.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.102
What's your intel on your suspect?

11:10.136 --> 11:12.171
Sir, he's a hacker,
an occupy Wall Street activist.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.439
It's all sketchy.

11:13.474 --> 11:15.775
What about your boy Esposito?
Is he someone we can count on?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.777
- He's solid?
- He's as solid as they get.

Hey, Beckett. I'm sorry.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.385
Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.
No, no, he's my partner.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.520
I should have never let
him go in there alone.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.622
We got to focus on
getting Javi out of there,

11:30.656 --> 11:33.658
so once you brief HRT,
just head over to Stone's apartment.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.394
Leave the scene?

11:35.428 --> 11:37.963
There's nothing that you can do
that HRT isn't already doing.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.531
And if we want to help Javi out,

11:39.565 --> 11:41.299
then the best thing that we can do

11:41.333 --> 11:44.202
is find out who Jared Stone
is and why he is doing this,

11:44.236 --> 11:46.571
and some of those answers
might be at his apartment.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.007
Okay. I'll check it out and let you know.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.812
Kate, is it true... what they're saying?

11:53.846 --> 11:57.181
Listen,
he has been in worse scrapes than this,

11:57.216 --> 11:58.816
and we're gonna get him out of there,
I promise you.

11:58.850 --> 12:02.887
Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish,
we've got eyes on Esposito.

12:10.095 --> 12:13.097
Beckett: Where's this coming from?

12:13.132 --> 12:16.166
I didn't think the MTA had
cameras in the subway cars.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.301
They don't.

12:17.335 --> 12:18.769
The train is part of a pilot
program for video security.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.738
This is on a separate feed,

12:20.772 --> 12:22.105
so it took me a while to find it.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.207
Wait, if this is on a separate feed...

12:24.242 --> 12:26.243
That means that we can see Stone,
but he doesn't know that.

12:26.277 --> 12:27.678
Which gives us a tactical edge.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.279
I'll make sure HRT knows about this.

12:29.314 --> 12:30.780
At least Javi's not down there alone.

12:30.815 --> 12:32.215
There's another cop with him.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.951
Beckett: Yeah, between the two of them,

12:33.985 --> 12:36.586
they might be able to
diffuse the situation.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.395
Kind of a weird time for him
to be hitting his playlist.

12:45.430 --> 12:48.030
He's trying to calm himself down.

12:48.065 --> 12:51.200
Because he's about to do what?

12:51.234 --> 12:53.035
I might need you to back me up.

try to get him to see the light,

13:01.078 --> 13:02.479
then disarm him if I get the chance.

13:02.513 --> 13:05.448
I should talk to him.
I'm the one wearing the kevlar.

13:05.482 --> 13:08.884
Yeah, but I've already got a
rapport with the guy, so...

13:08.918 --> 13:10.286
A bad rapport.

He's a little pedantic,
but he's an armchair revolutionary.

would have taken him right there.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.501
And if he was after one-percenters,

16:48.535 --> 16:50.869
this seminar would be a
target-rich environment.

16:50.903 --> 16:52.304
Sir, he also had a backup target.

16:52.339 --> 16:53.339
He had seats to an opera

at the biggest theater on Broadway...
1,900 seats.

16:56.009 --> 16:57.976

himself in the process.

20:06.132 --> 20:06.826
[Beep]

20:06.860 --> 20:07.827
That's all he said?

20:07.861 --> 20:09.895
Who the hell is Aaron Wilson?

20:09.930 --> 20:13.176
Well, if we want to save these people,
we need to find out.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.828
Beckett: Okay,
let's find who this Aaron Wilson is.

20:16.862 --> 20:18.163
[Keyboard clacking]

20:21.608 --> 20:23.283
Wait a minute.

20:25.542 --> 20:28.074
Castle, it's a woman... E-r-i-n.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.515
She's serving seven years in federal prison

20:30.550 --> 20:33.084
for felony computer trespassing.

20:33.118 --> 20:34.052
So she's a hacker, too.

20:34.086 --> 20:36.020
Court records show that
she hacked a database

20:36.055 --> 20:37.188
at the New York federal reserve,

20:37.222 --> 20:40.320
looking for proof that the fed
colluded with the big banks.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.239
What's her connection to Stone?

20:43.194 --> 20:45.296
It looks like Jared
Stone was an accomplice,

20:45.330 --> 20:48.101
but the U.S. attorney didn't
have enough to charge him.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.765
So they were partners in crime.
Erin went to prison, Stone didn't.

20:51.785 --> 20:54.036
That's why he wants to get her out.
He feels guilty.

20:54.056 --> 20:55.739
That would also explain the Maldives.

20:55.773 --> 20:57.975
- What do you mean?
- It's a non-extradition country.

20:58.009 --> 21:00.441
Hey, guys, you need to see this.

21:01.179 --> 21:03.880
What was in that shredder
was about two pages of text.

21:03.915 --> 21:06.282
So far, we've been able to
assemble a few random words,

21:06.317 --> 21:07.884
like "monitor" and "surveillance."

21:07.919 --> 21:09.119
Okay, what do you think it is?

21:09.153 --> 21:10.253
It's some kind of letter,

21:10.287 --> 21:12.155
but I don't think that Stone
was the one who wrote it.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.928
Take a look at this phrase
that we assembled just now.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.162
"Read, memorize, and then destroy"?

21:19.196 --> 21:20.831
It's not like he would
write that to himself.

21:20.865 --> 21:21.864
So they're instructions.

21:21.898 --> 21:23.833
Now we know Stone is
working with other people.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.835
Maybe this is all about Erin Wilson.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.440
Maybe she's the one behind all this.

21:28.139 --> 21:29.890
Castle and I will look into
Erin Wilson and dig deeper,

21:29.910 --> 21:32.142
and we'll also see if we
can identify any associates

21:32.176 --> 21:33.143
that Jared might have had.

21:33.177 --> 21:34.144
Ryan:
We'll keep piecing this together here.

21:34.178 --> 21:37.290
Guys,
everyone down there is counting on us.

21:38.457 --> 21:39.915
Esposito: Hey.

21:42.579 --> 21:44.838
Who's Erin Wilson?

21:45.689 --> 21:46.656
[Sniffs]

21:47.704 --> 21:49.424
She's my soul mate.

21:50.261 --> 21:51.827
[Coughs] Well,
why not give Bob more to go on

21:51.862 --> 21:53.328
so he knew who you were talking about?

21:53.363 --> 21:56.831
I want to keep him off-balance,
maintain control.

21:56.866 --> 21:58.700
You get that tip off the Internet?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.536
'Cause it's not a very good one.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.938
[Inhales deeply]

22:05.375 --> 22:06.575
What's White Knight?

22:09.579 --> 22:11.813
[Cellphone ringing] [Inhales deeply]

22:21.223 --> 22:23.391
[Beep]

22:23.425 --> 22:25.126
Tell me your plan for Erin.

22:26.383 --> 22:29.530
What the hell is taking so long, Bob?

22:29.565 --> 22:33.334
Getting her in prison didn't
seem to take any time at all!

22:33.368 --> 22:35.169
D... Bob, shut up!

22:35.204 --> 22:37.171
Shut up!

22:37.206 --> 22:38.372
Listen to me.

22:38.407 --> 22:40.938
I want her flown to the Maldives.

22:41.843 --> 22:43.578
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now, Bob.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.579
[Sniffs] Okay.

22:45.613 --> 22:46.847
I want her flown to the Maldives,

22:46.881 --> 22:50.217
and in half an hour, I want your
plan on how to make that happen.

22:50.251 --> 22:51.399
Are we clear?

22:51.419 --> 22:54.021
[Sniffs, breathing shakily]

22:54.055 --> 22:58.192
Yeah, Bob,
food would be great right about now.

22:58.483 --> 23:00.594
No. don't send any cops.

23:00.628 --> 23:02.229
I don't care if they're unarmed, Bob!

23:02.263 --> 23:04.063
I don't want any police near this car!

23:04.098 --> 23:06.065
Just drop the food!

23:06.100 --> 23:07.267
Then set it on the edge of the platform!

23:07.301 --> 23:08.768
I'll send somebody to get it.

23:08.802 --> 23:10.437
[Beep]

23:10.471 --> 23:14.541
You, the husband, go. Get the food.

23:14.575 --> 23:17.076
I know you'll come back.

23:20.447 --> 23:21.981
I just got bad news.

23:22.705 --> 23:25.184
I called the prison and
spoke to Erin Wilson.

23:25.219 --> 23:27.019
And?

23:27.054 --> 23:29.222
She's Stone's girlfriend,
but she didn't seem to know

23:29.256 --> 23:31.523
about his plan to break
her out until just now.

23:31.558 --> 23:33.925
What about you?
Anything on Stone's known associates?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.528
Stone may have lived online,
but he wasn't very social.

23:36.563 --> 23:38.196
He started a "Free Erin Wilson" website

23:38.231 --> 23:40.031
but didn't seem to interact
with any other users.

23:40.066 --> 23:41.800
He had to have interacted with somebody.

23:41.834 --> 23:44.102
Tech scrubbed his computer
and found a hidden directory

23:44.137 --> 23:46.305
that they think contained
private correspondence.

23:46.339 --> 23:47.773
- From whom?
- The contents were thoroughly erased.

23:47.807 --> 23:49.207
The only thing that was left

23:49.242 --> 23:51.376
was the name of the directory...
"White Knight."

23:53.287 --> 23:55.313
Ty: Okay, who's next?

23:55.347 --> 23:57.582
We got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.

23:57.616 --> 24:00.085
Uh, right here. Thanks.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.317
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

24:03.337 --> 24:06.295
Veggie with eggplant and garlic.

24:06.315 --> 24:09.392
Pineapple, olives, double jalapeno.

24:10.362 --> 24:12.730
- That's for me.
- Really?

24:12.765 --> 24:14.332
We're trapped in a subway car.

24:14.366 --> 24:17.468
I'm not sure you should eat that.

24:37.455 --> 24:38.655
[Coughs]

24:55.473 --> 24:58.374
Marisa: You gonna eat that thing,
or just gaze at it in wonder?

24:58.408 --> 25:02.378
I don't understand.
Why does HRT want to breach?

25:02.412 --> 25:04.214
In their assessment, Stone is trapped,

25:04.248 --> 25:07.050
with no good options and no way
to carry out his original plan.

25:07.084 --> 25:09.185
They believe the longer this goes,

25:09.220 --> 25:11.620
the more likely he will do the unthinkable.

25:11.655 --> 25:13.222
Well, why not see how things
play out with Erin Wilson?

25:13.256 --> 25:16.392
HRT thinks the Erin
Wilson demand is a ruse,

25:16.426 --> 25:19.562
Stone is playing this card to buy time,
work up his nerve.

25:19.596 --> 25:22.231
If they bust in,
what'll keep Stone from blowing that vest?

25:22.265 --> 25:23.833
Esposito will. He's in on it.

25:23.867 --> 25:25.835
Won't Stone see HRT coming?

25:25.869 --> 25:27.636
Yes, if they approach via the tunnel,

25:27.671 --> 25:28.838
but they're dropping onto
the train from above,

25:28.872 --> 25:29.872
through the subway grates.

25:29.906 --> 25:31.539
When?

25:31.574 --> 25:33.041
Soon.

25:33.076 --> 25:35.344
Any moment now.

25:35.378 --> 25:38.180
You sure we shouldn't tell the others?

25:38.214 --> 25:39.681
No.

25:40.512 --> 25:43.651
They'll get nervous,
and Stone will pick up on it.

25:49.289 --> 25:51.485
Hey, why did you become a cop?

25:52.628 --> 25:56.598
I got out of the army.
It's what made the most sense.

25:56.632 --> 25:58.032
Me too.

25:58.462 --> 26:00.981
You miss the service?

26:01.437 --> 26:02.770
Some parts.

26:02.804 --> 26:04.705
Not others.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.825
Married? Kids?

26:09.411 --> 26:13.580
No. don't do this, okay?

26:13.615 --> 26:15.582
Don't try to take my mind
off of what's coming.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.351
I don't need anyone holding my hand.

26:17.386 --> 26:19.185
You know, you got a chip on your shoulder

26:19.220 --> 26:21.388
the size of Stonehenge.

26:21.423 --> 26:23.424
I was just trying to get
to know you a little bit.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.593
Oh.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.862
[Electricity buzzes]

26:30.832 --> 26:32.994
- You see that?
- Sure did.

26:34.545 --> 26:36.803
The next flicker is go time.

26:36.837 --> 26:39.105
- You clear on the plan?
- Don't worry about me.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.173
[Inhales deeply]

26:43.311 --> 26:45.778
I can feel vibrations.
They're on the train.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.447
[Electricity buzzes]

26:56.590 --> 26:58.122
[Dialing]

26:58.157 --> 26:59.491
[Beep]

27:00.116 --> 27:03.294
You pull your people back
now or everybody dies.

27:04.025 --> 27:05.063
Now!

27:05.097 --> 27:07.090
I know they're here!

27:07.110 --> 27:09.468
Don't screw with me, Bob,

27:09.502 --> 27:12.545
or I will pull my hand off
this trigger right now!

27:13.178 --> 27:15.473
How am I supposed to trust they're gone,
huh?

27:15.507 --> 27:17.308
You just tried to send storm troopers

27:17.343 --> 27:19.310
into a subway car full of people,

27:19.345 --> 27:23.147
not knowing where they are or where I am...

27:26.285 --> 27:27.618
[Beep]

27:27.652 --> 27:30.221
Wait a second.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.098
Beckett: Don't worry. He's gonna be okay.

27:45.132 --> 27:47.009
I know. I know.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.104
How is she?

27:53.138 --> 27:54.338
[Sighs]

27:54.373 --> 27:56.840
Well, at least when she could see Javi,
she knew he was okay.

27:57.674 --> 27:59.277
We'll get Espo back.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.818
The key is finding out who
Stone was working with.

28:00.838 --> 28:02.866
The answer's probably in
that White Knight directory.

28:02.886 --> 28:05.717
But so far, but tech hasn't been
able to recover any of the data.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.760
Well, then, we'll revisit the victim.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.421
Looking into Paul reeve's investigations
is what led us to Stone.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.097
Perhaps it'll lead us to the others,
as well.

28:12.117 --> 28:13.320
Yeah.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.628
Tory, let me ask you something.

28:17.662 --> 28:20.431
Uh, t-the video from the subway...

28:20.465 --> 28:22.566
before it cut out, did you record it?

28:22.601 --> 28:25.726
Of course. All streaming video
is archived automatically.

28:25.746 --> 28:26.813
Why?

28:26.999 --> 28:30.300
Could you show it to me?
There's something I'd like to see.

28:31.864 --> 28:33.994
[Keyboard clacking]

28:34.014 --> 28:36.463
These are all 20 of the case files
Paul Reeves was working on.

28:36.483 --> 28:38.295
Here's just a summary of those cases.

28:38.315 --> 28:39.982
I figure we just go through these

28:40.016 --> 28:42.252
until something points to
Stone or to Erin Wilson

28:42.286 --> 28:43.853
or anything else we're dealing with.

28:43.887 --> 28:44.820
Okay. I'll start.

28:44.855 --> 28:46.623
Uh,
the first one is that pharmaceutical lab

28:46.657 --> 28:49.024
cited for losing samples of a flu virus.

28:49.059 --> 28:50.192
Not ringing any bells.

28:50.227 --> 28:51.294
Moving on to a medical chain

28:51.328 --> 28:53.763
that knowingly implanted
defective artificial hips.

28:53.797 --> 28:56.966
Hey, guys, that document...
I think it's a playbook.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.167
Stone's following it to the letter.

28:58.201 --> 28:59.769
Take a look at this sentence fragment.

28:59.803 --> 29:03.672
"Demand Erin Wilson's release from prison,
then hang up."

29:03.706 --> 29:04.907
More instructions?

29:04.941 --> 29:07.542
I mean, how is that telling us
anything we don't already know?

29:07.577 --> 29:08.844
You'll see.

29:08.879 --> 29:10.012
[Beep] Now take a look at this one.

29:10.046 --> 29:12.781
"And demand Erin be flown to
a non-extradition country."

29:12.815 --> 29:15.183
But that instruction comes
later on in the document,

29:15.217 --> 29:16.851
which is exactly how Stone played it.

29:16.886 --> 29:18.287
First, he demanded her release,

29:18.321 --> 29:20.155
and then he brought up the Maldives.

29:20.189 --> 29:21.156
That doesn't make any sense.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.358
If Stone wanted Erin
Wilson freed from prison,

29:23.393 --> 29:25.360
then why would he wait to
mention the Maldives until later?

29:25.395 --> 29:28.330
For the same reason he asked
about Erin Wilson's release

29:28.364 --> 29:30.331
without explaining who she was.

29:30.365 --> 29:33.334
Stone is stalling. He's playing for time.

29:33.368 --> 29:34.669
Something else is going on here,
something big.

29:34.703 --> 29:37.471
Kate, I need to show you something.

29:37.506 --> 29:40.374
I noticed something when
I was watching earlier,

29:40.409 --> 29:43.344
so I went to watch this whole video.

29:43.378 --> 29:46.814
We have a problem... a new problem.

29:46.848 --> 29:48.516
[Beep]

29:48.550 --> 29:49.917
[Sighs] This is Stone

29:49.951 --> 29:51.919
back when he was just
holding them all hostage.

29:51.953 --> 29:54.254
This is him later... and later.

29:54.289 --> 29:56.757
Castle: His asthma's getting worse.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.726
It's not just his asthma.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.329
It looks like he has fever and chills.

30:01.363 --> 30:03.596
It's only a matter of time before
he's not able to think clearly.

30:03.631 --> 30:04.664
The man is sick,

30:04.699 --> 30:07.367
and he's getting sicker
with flu-like symptoms.

30:07.401 --> 30:09.369
Flu-like symptoms?

30:09.403 --> 30:10.938
Uh, Castle, that case.

30:10.972 --> 30:14.174
Paul Reeves was investigating
a missing flu virus.

30:14.209 --> 30:16.540
This is all connected somehow.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.859
It has to be.

30:17.879 --> 30:20.547
Once I hear that she's in
international airspace,

30:20.581 --> 30:21.781
I'll surrender.

30:21.816 --> 30:23.783
[Coughs]

30:23.818 --> 30:25.418
[Sniffs, inhales deeply]

30:25.453 --> 30:27.186
[Inhales deeply]

30:27.221 --> 30:28.355
[Sighs]

30:28.389 --> 30:30.857
Because I'm giving you my word.

30:30.891 --> 30:33.226
Stone's not looking too good.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.394
Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take,
huh?

30:35.428 --> 30:37.363
If he passes out and releases that switch,
we're all dead.

30:37.397 --> 30:38.764
- We got to make a move.
- Bob, Bob, Bob, that's...

30:38.798 --> 30:40.199
- The same plan as before?
- That's not acceptable.

30:40.234 --> 30:41.467
Yeah.

30:41.501 --> 30:43.202
[Sighs]
When?

30:43.237 --> 30:45.972
He gets distracted when
he puffs on his inhaler.

30:46.006 --> 30:47.439
Next puff, we go.

30:48.675 --> 30:50.142
Look, those are my conditions.

30:50.177 --> 30:53.379
Once I hear from Erin that she's free,

30:53.413 --> 30:55.748
I swear, I'll let everybody go.

30:58.418 --> 31:00.151
[Beep]

31:00.186 --> 31:03.088
[Sighs] Don't worry, everyone.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.791
It's almost over. [Inhales deeply]

31:08.494 --> 31:09.494
[All gasping]

31:09.528 --> 31:11.496
No, stop!

31:11.530 --> 31:13.398
- Please!
- Secure the switch.

31:13.432 --> 31:17.122
I'm not done yet! I'm not done yet!

31:17.142 --> 31:18.803
Go, go, go, go.

31:21.807 --> 31:23.674
Good job.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.743
[All sigh]

31:29.981 --> 31:31.816
[Dialing]

31:34.223 --> 31:35.185
[Beep] Hey, Javi.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.754
Esposito: What's up? We took down Stone.

31:36.789 --> 31:40.080
Nobody's hurt. Everybody's fine. It's over.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.293
It's not over, man.

31:42.327 --> 31:44.295
What? What do you mean, it's not over?

31:44.329 --> 31:46.297
I don't want a ticker-tape
parade or anything like that,

31:46.331 --> 31:47.398
but did you not just hear what I said?

31:47.432 --> 31:50.334
Listen, Javi.
This is about more than a suicide vest.

31:50.368 --> 31:53.537
The CDC turned up a lethal
variant of the H5N1 virus

31:53.571 --> 31:54.972
in Stone's apartment.

31:55.006 --> 31:58.141
It's a hot zone. Stone's infected...

31:59.272 --> 32:01.377
and everyone around him might be, too.

32:01.412 --> 32:03.847
I got the door open! I got it!

32:03.881 --> 32:06.648
Close that door! I said close it now!

32:06.668 --> 32:09.486
Nobody leaves the train!

32:14.818 --> 32:16.210
Sir, how is Esposito?

32:16.230 --> 32:18.940
Well, he and the others were
transported to the hospital,

32:18.960 --> 32:21.324
- but they're in isolation.
- What's the prognosis?

32:21.358 --> 32:24.494
Well,
this particular strain of H5N1 is lethal

32:24.528 --> 32:27.129
and can be spread through airborne contact.

32:27.164 --> 32:28.531
But there is a vaccine.

32:28.566 --> 32:30.132
It's been given to the passengers,

32:30.167 --> 32:32.936
and it can knock down the
virus even after exposure.

32:33.634 --> 32:35.338
So he's gonna be okay?

32:35.372 --> 32:36.772
Doctors are optimistic.

32:36.806 --> 32:39.041
And the CDC is retracing Stone's steps

32:39.076 --> 32:42.011
to identify who else
he was in contact with.

32:42.045 --> 32:43.612
This guy's like an evil
version of typhoid Mary.

32:43.646 --> 32:46.015
The suicide vest, the demands...

32:46.049 --> 32:47.216
all about exposing people

32:47.250 --> 32:49.185
long enough to get them infected
so they'd spread the virus.

32:49.219 --> 32:51.019
Well, it could have been far worse

32:51.053 --> 32:53.188
if he had made it to that
seminar or the opera.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.390
In proximity to all those people,

32:55.424 --> 32:57.192
he could have caused an epidemic.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.873
But I-I-I'm still not clear.

32:59.893 --> 33:02.765
How does our shooting
victim fit into all this?

33:02.785 --> 33:04.867
Paul Reeves was investigating the lab

33:04.901 --> 33:07.502
where a sample of H5N1 went missing.

33:07.536 --> 33:10.505
We think he figured out that
Stone had stolen the virus,

33:10.539 --> 33:12.874
which is why Stone lured him
into the park and killed him.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.476
Beckett: But, sir,
there are still questions,

33:14.510 --> 33:16.411
like who Stone was working with

33:16.445 --> 33:18.213
and why he did this in the first place,

33:18.247 --> 33:20.212
so we need to go and talk to him.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.884
Well, you better hurry up
because I hear he's not in good shape.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.986
Yes, sir.

33:28.123 --> 33:29.323
[Monitor beeping]

33:29.357 --> 33:31.959
[Coughing]

33:37.849 --> 33:39.033
You're not the priest.

33:39.067 --> 33:41.380
No, but I can take your confession.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.738
We know you had help, Mr. Stone.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.006
White Knight... who is he?

33:46.041 --> 33:48.042
[Sighs]

33:48.076 --> 33:51.445
Someone I met through the "Free Erin" site
a few months back.

33:51.479 --> 33:53.180
What was his real name?

33:53.214 --> 33:54.148
I don't know.

33:54.182 --> 33:58.919
We bonded over Erin...
Over how to get her out.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.420
He was a strategic thinker.

34:00.454 --> 34:03.276
I wasn't, so he helped me with the plan.

34:04.256 --> 34:06.760
I never would have detonated that vest.

34:07.532 --> 34:10.563
I just... I just needed some leverage.

34:10.598 --> 34:12.931
I love Erin.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.935
All I wanted was to see her free.

34:15.969 --> 34:18.281
More like you wanted to get people sick.

34:18.964 --> 34:19.937
What do you mean?

34:19.956 --> 34:22.942
You tried to start an epidemic
by spreading your deadly virus.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.976
Erin was just a sideshow.

34:25.011 --> 34:27.179
- What are you talking about?
- The opera, the seminar...

34:27.214 --> 34:29.982
hundreds of one-percenters
in close proximity.

34:30.016 --> 34:32.885
That was the perfect environment
to spread your disease.

34:32.918 --> 34:34.887
It... disease?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.889
No, I... I was trying to find the best spot

34:37.924 --> 34:39.224
to take my stand for Erin.

34:39.257 --> 34:40.893
Then why did you call Paul Reeves?

34:40.927 --> 34:43.062
White Knight s-said that
it was part of the plan.

34:43.096 --> 34:48.065
I-I... called Reeves to tell him
about some meeting at the park.

34:48.626 --> 34:50.934
I didn't even know who he was.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.975
The seminar and the opera...

34:57.009 --> 34:59.436
were those White Knight's ideas, too?

35:04.077 --> 35:05.987
So I was set up.

35:06.247 --> 35:08.424
Somebody used me.

35:08.444 --> 35:10.187
This thing I have...

35:10.222 --> 35:13.324
I may have given it to other people, too?

35:18.535 --> 35:21.965
Okay, that is not how I imagined
that conversation would go.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.967
If Stone's telling the truth,
then he's a fall guy.

35:24.002 --> 35:26.137
He was groomed,
turned into a vector for the virus,

35:26.171 --> 35:27.971
and manipulated into spreading it.

35:28.006 --> 35:30.141
Which means this all connects
to Paul Reeves' investigation

35:30.175 --> 35:32.510
of the lab where the virus came from.

35:34.513 --> 35:36.479
[Receiver clicks] Stone
was deliberately infected.

35:36.514 --> 35:39.683
The CDC confirmed that someone
turned his asthma inhaler

35:39.717 --> 35:41.484
into a virus-delivery system.

35:41.519 --> 35:43.153
The question is,
who came up with that idea?

35:43.187 --> 35:44.554
The answer has got to be connected

35:44.588 --> 35:46.957
to this lab that Paul was investigating.

35:46.991 --> 35:48.491
I think it is.
Beckett, take a look at this.

35:48.526 --> 35:52.895
The, uh,
lab from which the virus went missing...

35:52.929 --> 35:54.531
uh, Latham Pharmaceuticals...
they're the same company

35:54.565 --> 35:56.832
that makes the vaccine that
Espo and the others got.

35:56.867 --> 35:59.636
Which is why they had samples
of H5N1 in the first place.

35:59.670 --> 36:01.404
Right, but as part of his investigation,

36:01.438 --> 36:04.040
Paul was looking into production
orders of the vaccine...

36:04.074 --> 36:07.210
specifically, this one for 10
million units of the vaccine.

36:07.244 --> 36:11.313
Castle,
there were only 1,000 reported cases

36:11.347 --> 36:13.248
of H5N1 worldwide.

36:13.283 --> 36:16.819
So why would Latham suddenly
order up 10 million vaccines?

36:16.853 --> 36:18.387
Unless they knew that there
was gonna be an outbreak.

36:18.421 --> 36:20.504
I think Paul was asking the same question.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.061
Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.

36:26.095 --> 36:27.162
O-of course.

36:27.197 --> 36:30.432
Yeah, d... have you found whoever,
uh, did this to Paul?

36:30.466 --> 36:32.668
No, not yet,
but we do have a few questions.

36:32.702 --> 36:34.069
Now, do you know

36:34.103 --> 36:36.905
why he was investigating
Latham Pharmaceuticals?

36:36.939 --> 36:38.707
It was his job.

36:38.741 --> 36:41.509
Companies that produce
vaccines with federal money

36:41.543 --> 36:43.111
are tracked by G.A.O.

36:43.145 --> 36:45.113
And Latham developed a vaccine

36:45.147 --> 36:47.115
for a rare but deadly flu virus,
didn't they?

36:47.149 --> 36:48.516
I mean, a flu so rare

36:48.550 --> 36:50.919
that the vaccine just sits on the shelf.

36:50.953 --> 36:52.954
Yeah, we see that a lot.

36:52.988 --> 36:55.256
Preventive vaccines are created,

36:55.290 --> 36:58.259
but not all flu strains become widespread.

36:58.293 --> 37:01.195
- Well, they do with a little help.
- Excuse me?

37:01.230 --> 37:03.231
You recently converted all of
your assets to Latham stock.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.991
Why is that?

37:05.835 --> 37:08.236
How I invest is none of your concern.

37:08.270 --> 37:11.305
It became my concern when you
tried to start an H5N1 epidemic.

37:11.340 --> 37:13.971
Castle: With the help of someone gullible,

37:13.991 --> 37:17.144
someone you could easily manipulate,
like Jared Stone.

37:17.178 --> 37:20.214
What on earth are you talking about?
I d... I don't know any Jared Stone.

37:20.248 --> 37:22.216
Your husband was one of the prosecutors

37:22.250 --> 37:24.338
who put away his girlfriend, Erin Wilson.

37:24.358 --> 37:27.087
So when you needed a patsy,
you knew just where to look.

37:27.122 --> 37:29.223
And then your colleague Paul,

37:29.257 --> 37:31.575
when he saw that huge vaccine order,
he started digging.

37:31.595 --> 37:33.826
And when you saw that he was
getting closer to the truth,

37:33.861 --> 37:34.794
you eliminated him.

37:34.828 --> 37:37.297
That is absurd.
You can't prove any of this.

37:37.331 --> 37:38.487
Castle: Actually, we can.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.143
We found the e-mails you
wrote in your cloud account,

37:41.453 --> 37:43.264
under the username "White Knight."

37:43.284 --> 37:46.673
We also arrested a Latham executive
with whom you were colluding.

37:46.707 --> 37:49.228
He admitted to his role, and he cut a deal.

37:49.248 --> 37:50.779
And he threw you under the bus.

37:50.799 --> 37:53.780
You could have infected
and killed millions of people, Ms. Jarvis.

37:53.814 --> 37:54.914
And for what,

37:54.948 --> 37:57.784
so you could drive a nicer car,
buy a bigger house?

37:57.818 --> 38:00.660
Was this all just because of money?

38:02.894 --> 38:06.007
- I want a lawyer.
- You better find a good one.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.298
Hey.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.265
Hey.

38:15.168 --> 38:18.457
So, I, uh... I hear everybody's good to go.

38:18.477 --> 38:19.672
Clean bills of health.

38:19.706 --> 38:20.672
This time yesterday,

38:20.706 --> 38:22.874
catching the flu was the
least of our problems.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.342
You did all right down there.

38:24.376 --> 38:25.777
I don't care what they
say about transit cops.

38:25.812 --> 38:26.812
Mm.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.379
What they say about gold
shields is even worse...

38:28.414 --> 38:30.062
mostly 'cause it's true.

38:32.765 --> 38:34.767
We make a tight team.

38:34.787 --> 38:37.497
Bonds forged in the heat of battle...
you know how it is.

38:37.517 --> 38:39.190
Yeah.

38:39.453 --> 38:41.326
I wasn't straight with you.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.570
I have a 5-year-old son.

38:44.948 --> 38:48.399
Uh, you said that you didn't have a family.

38:48.981 --> 38:49.899
Why hide that?

38:49.919 --> 38:52.537
I didn't want you worried about
me being a mom down there.

38:52.571 --> 38:53.537
[Scoffs]

38:53.571 --> 38:55.684
You are a piece of work, Marisa.

38:55.704 --> 38:57.186
Who's Lenny?

38:57.769 --> 38:59.085
Or is it Lanie?

39:00.934 --> 39:02.213
How do you know about her?

39:02.247 --> 39:05.082
On my last tour,
an I.E.D. blew out my eardrum.

39:05.116 --> 39:06.833
Got pretty good at reading lips.

39:06.853 --> 39:08.418
You were saying her name
before you took down Stone.

39:08.453 --> 39:11.888
Yeah, I don't... I don't remember that.

39:11.922 --> 39:15.024
Who you think of in that moment...
it has weight.

39:16.637 --> 39:19.727
Don't trade what's real
for something that isn't.

39:21.477 --> 39:24.668
I'll see you around, Javi.

39:31.507 --> 39:33.509
Well,
it's not every day you come across someone

39:33.543 --> 39:35.511
who makes a suicide bomber
look like the good guy.

39:36.248 --> 39:37.847
So, I talked to the hospital.

39:37.882 --> 39:40.549
Jared Stone will make a full recovery,

39:40.584 --> 39:43.118
though clearly his
troubles aren't over yet.

39:43.152 --> 39:45.354
Yeah, unless he goes to the
same prison as Erin Wilson,

39:45.389 --> 39:47.289
because in the end, Jared Stone was driven

39:47.323 --> 39:51.093
by the most primal of emotions... love.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.505
Except he could have picked
a better way to express it.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.632
Hey, look who's here. What's up?

39:56.666 --> 39:59.701
- Beckett: Hey!
- Hail the conquering hero!

39:59.735 --> 40:01.703
Man, you gave me a scare.

40:01.737 --> 40:03.948
- That's because you're a wimp.
- Oh. Okay.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.308
Yeah, well,
I guess that makes me a wimp, too.

40:06.342 --> 40:07.155
Oh.

40:07.175 --> 40:10.294
Got any of that left over for me?

40:13.062 --> 40:15.284
Javi, I was worried sick. I thought...

40:15.318 --> 40:16.718
I know what you thought, but I'm here.

40:16.752 --> 40:20.254
I'm back. I'm all right.

40:24.827 --> 40:27.595
I hate to interrupt,
but I have a brilliant idea.

40:27.630 --> 40:29.330
How about we all go to the old haunt, huh?

40:29.364 --> 40:30.765
Drinks on me.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.133
Yeah.

40:32.167 --> 40:34.101
Come on, we'll take the subway.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.305
- Too soon?
- Too soon.

40:37.339 --> 40:39.672
Please accept this as
a token of my apology.

40:39.706 --> 40:41.816
[Laughs] Am I on the wrong track, here?
