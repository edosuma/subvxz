Sir...

04:47.579 --> 04:50.503
a friend told me I might be able to rent
a room here for a night or two.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.133
Really, he must not be
a very good friend,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.422
cause we're all filled up
buddy.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.552
There a guy named
Lorne Corral here?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.843
My friend told me Lorne
would be sure to set it up.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.221
What'd you say
your friends name was?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.855
Billy Pettigrew.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.356
The Buddha sent you here?

05:14.357 --> 05:15.403
That's right.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.901
Hey, Troy.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.490
<i>You got a room?
Of course lha ve a room...</i>

05:19.736 --> 05:21.579
always got a room
for a friend of Buddha's.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.167
Hey, I need a favour,
can you cover here for me.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.209
I reckon I'll be on my way.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.971
<i>A/fa/c/mrrs G/1a? Cx2-.?5.</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:39.427

05:42.884 --> 05:45.979
Listen, entrance for room outside
you got to go through the bar,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.939
out to the left and
around back, okay.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.308
You'll see it.
Okay? Hey listen...

05:49.641 --> 05:51.609
<i>/f you need anything,
/ mean anything al' all.</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:52.943
<i>Don '2' be scared.</i>

05:53.103 --> 05:54.400
Okay. Thank you.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.001
Hello!

07:37.082 --> 07:38.925
You want to shut the hell up!

08:30.218 --> 08:31.891
Hey!!

08:32.011 --> 08:33.605
Fuck!

08:40.520 --> 08:42.648
<i>No! Calm down and...</i>

08:47.193 --> 08:48.194
<i>Stop it!</i>

09:19.768 --> 09:21.987
<i>In this hell hO/e Chuck.</i>

09:23.897 --> 09:26.525
God and the Devil
mimic each other.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.578
It's near impossible to
tell them apart.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.953
A smart man...

09:38.328 --> 09:40.956
only wants
someone he can trust.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.090
I thought I had such a friend
but I was deceived.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.424
He stole my money
and took my freedom...

09:50.882 --> 09:54.011
but that wasn't half as bad
as what he did to my heart.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.311
If you can't trust another soul
you got nothing.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.693
You're dead.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.736
You do know...

10:11.194 --> 10:13.162
why you're here,
don't you Charlie?

10:19.953 --> 10:20.875
I understand.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.797
<i>But' why me .7.</i>

10:23.915 --> 10:25.508
Consider it a favour.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.090
<i>It' is for you.</i>

10:28.211 --> 10:29.337
Not for me.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.727
You talking about this man?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.896
It's the one you want dead...

10:39.055 --> 10:41.524
the one that climbed into
little Charlie's head

10:41.850 --> 10:42.942
and made it his own.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.653
<i>He's sf/I/ there.</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:48.690
<i>He's st/I/ giving the orders.</i>

10:49.274 --> 10:50.321
<i>/ can hear him.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:53.695
<i>Sometimes...</i>

10:54.279 --> 10:56.452
<i>/ hear him better than
/ hear you.</i>

11:07.584 --> 11:09.461
Good aftemoosm.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.172
You fwave good
visit last night?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.095
What do you know about
me having a visitor?

11:15.425 --> 11:16.927
Nothing. I...

11:17.051 --> 11:19.145
"I just figured you" had a long
night with someone.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.105
I mean, it's afternoon.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.686
Why don't you stay out
of my business

11:22.807 --> 11:24.229
and I'll stay out of yours.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.786
Hey, partner.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.663
You want to make a fiver?

13:50.413 --> 13:51.790
What do I have to do for it?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.376
Get a gym bag out of locker 130.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.177
Why don' you get it?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.095
Hey, heY...

14:02.300 --> 14:04.348
Get the bag first, huh.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.141
130.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.621
Hey!

14:25.823 --> 14:26.699
Agh!

14:26.866 --> 14:27.867
Who sent you?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.164
Who gave you the fucking
locker number?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.290
No one did!

14:30.453 --> 14:31.545
Agh!

14:31.662 --> 14:33.084
Agh!

15:44.944 --> 15:47.322
<i>Looking at $78.9. 50.</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:06.595
<i>50 how do you ďŹ/re

16:07.049 --> 16:08.767
<i>"." You know what they're
saying to me?</i>

16:08.926 --> 16:11.429
<i>They're saying here 3 nobodyis mark.</i>

16:11.554 --> 16:13.682
<i>A guy with his head on his shoulders</i>

16:13.806 --> 16:15.433
<i>an eye to the future.</i>

16:15.558 --> 16:17.856
<i>Somebody who knows how to
take care of business.</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:19.479
<i>Take care of W/vafi?</i>

16:21.772 --> 16:23.365
<i>Nice.</i>

16:35.828 --> 16:37.501
What kind of boots are those?

16:40.666 --> 16:43.215
You mean my ventilated
gold diggers?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.638
Save_ those fo_r
special occasnons.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.723
How do you know this one isn't?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.050
Which one?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.559
This one.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.229
I never said it wasn't.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.819
I'm Florence.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.165
The way it works now is you
say what you want me to call you.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.288
Sam.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.127
For Samuel?

17:22.415 --> 17:23.588
For Samson.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.301
Strong guy got
done in by Delilah.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.800
I've never heard that.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.141
You ain't read the Bible?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.773
Mine's the next stop.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.667
Is that Willimette?

18:00.830 --> 18:04.801
Oto, Willimette's a whole
different neighbourhood.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.632
Where you from then?

18:12.633 --> 18:13.885
South a ways.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.012
You ain't giving away
no secrets, are you?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.138
Go ahead.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.141
Ain't that why anybody
talks to strangers?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.277
I figured people got a
lot of reasons to.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.898
Have you got business
in Willimette?

18:28.649 --> 18:29.741
Later I do.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.661
What are you gonna do till then?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.447
Eat something.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.033
There's a pizza joint
right below my place.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.162
They only got take out,
but it's pretty good.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.474
My ex left a few things
when he split.

18:56.761 --> 18:57.933
0h yeah?

19:00.056 --> 19:02.434
I, I got to keep a clear head, so.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.566
For your mysterious business
in Willimette?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.319
<i>You got anybody Samson?</i>

19:14.320 --> 19:16.163
Like how I ain't got nobody...

19:16.280 --> 19:18.282
except an ex?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.914
I had a dog.

19:26.874 --> 19:27.966
The guy I left it with

19:28.417 --> 19:31.216
when I was in jail said it got run
over by lumber truck.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.554
How long was you in jail for?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.103
Four years.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.482
You smoke weed?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.856
I just told you about that.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.525
Mm, gotta keep a clear head.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.122
<i>Was it a b/y dog?</i>

19:59.490 --> 20:00.867
It was medium big.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.245
Looked a lot like a
Border Collie...

20:04.412 --> 20:06.005
some Sheppard in it.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.298
Did you treat her good Samson?

20:08.416 --> 20:10.919
Yeah, till I left it with who
I told you about I did.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.887
You think he didn't die
how he said it did?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.015
I think I trusted a good dog

20:17.133 --> 20:18.430
to a son of a bitch who killed it

20:18.551 --> 20:20.929
<i>for the money I sent him
each week to feed it.</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:26.313
I loved a cat to death for
six years that died.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.903
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.234
His name was Gold.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.195
On account of his colour.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.117
Do you mind if I smoke Sam?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.285
No.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.327
Your your ex still got a key?

20:45.119 --> 20:47.121
He hasn't used it far as I know.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.586
So no roommate's gonna pop in?

20:50.833 --> 20:53.677
Was us coming here Samson...

20:54.044 --> 20:55.842
was that my idea or yours?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.391
Well, I ain't clear on that either.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.481
You want to watch a movie?

21:08.058 --> 21:09.355
You got one any good?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.153
I got one starring me.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.484
How's that?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.900
As soon <i>as</i> I use the john.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.527
It's over there.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.867
From whom you can hide nothing.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.576
<i>I'm in two minds on this.</i>

22:48.701 --> 22:50.203
<i>Reason / am Samson is,</i>

22:50.327 --> 22:53.001
<i>I've known people and / don't know
whether or not you're one of them</i>

22:53.247 --> 22:55.625
to get the artist mixed
up with their art.

23:01.255 --> 23:04.509
<i>They get all sorts of ideas regarding
one from the other.</i>

23:07.595 --> 23:08.687
What sort of ones they get?

23:08.804 --> 23:09.726
<i>Sister Chastity.</i>

23:09.889 --> 23:12.312
<i>Conc/ude for example
that's Florence.</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:14.564
It ain't?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.189
<i>Who is she?</i>

23:18.480 --> 23:19.777
<i>Girl named LouAnr/e.</i>

23:20.816 --> 23:23.615
I'm sorry father, but I have
nothing to confess.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.655
<i>See, I'm Florence,
I'm the actor.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:27.831
<i>That's somebody else, get it?</i>

23:30.910 --> 23:35.507
<i>Each night' I'd lay in bed thinking who</i>
<i>she, and she '0' come in...</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:40.673
<i>Florence is sort of shy really.</i>

23:41.003 --> 23:43.426
<i>She I/kes to hold hands,
talk, even if it's babble,</i>

23:43.505 --> 23:45.678
do a little blow to cut the ice.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.426
<i>But LouAnn,</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:49.808
<i>wide eyed lift/e LouAnn...</i>

23:50.346 --> 23:53.816
<i>she comes off as all
sweet and innocent at first but,</i>

23:54.308 --> 23:56.527
<i>/ '/I just say
she a/n '1' no Florence.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:00.773
Isn't that right father?

24:01.148 --> 24:03.116
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

24:03.317 --> 24:06.617
<i>Free yourself of those
nasty hab/ts.</i>

24:07.738 --> 24:10.617
<i>On one hand / 'm proud of my
performance.</i>

24:15.412 --> 24:17.585
<i>But on the other hand
LouAnnis so powerful</i>

24:17.706 --> 24:19.299

I never met a movie person
before, but I don't think I'd mix...

24:30.302 --> 24:31.849
one up for the real person.

24:31.971 --> 24:36.568
Samson, I think you got
layers, that's what I think.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.448
If I put my feet in your lap, will
you rub them good?

hurry if you ain't hon.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.984
Do you want
me to take off my clothes,

25:23.105 --> 25:24.778

get aroused, huh?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.664

25:39.455 --> 25:41.583
Our potential together?

<i>Whoa!</i>

36:56.297 --> 37:00.473
Samson, I knew you'd recognise the
connection between us.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.495
Mind if I wear these,
my clothes are still drying.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.958
Where'd you find those pants?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.998
Just somg drawer,

37:26.119 --> 37:26.915
No.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.859
What happened to you Samson?

37:54.481 --> 37:56.654
You tangle with that lion again?

37:57.192 --> 37:59.991
What Lion? What are
you talking about?

38:02.071 --> 38:04.073
It's where it hurts you most?

38:04.866 --> 38:06.743
Who says anything
hurts me, alright?

38:06.868 --> 38:09.041
Pain's written all over you.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.503
Come here, let me
rub your back.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.012
Look, I don't want nothing happening
past what's already happened.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.236
You don't want to be with
me in no kind of way.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.155
Why don't I?

38:36.648 --> 38:37.945
I just ain't.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.618
I ain't a guy you'd end up
liking that's all.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.621
You don't mean that Samson.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.490
You wouldn't have come back
if you didn"t like me

38:45.615 --> 38:47.162
and want me to like you.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.602
<i>There's this rich friend
of mine in prison.</i>

39:12.058 --> 39:13.685
We called him the Buddha.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.902
He used to love telling me about all
the fancy dishes he loved to eat.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.527
Shrimp and...

39:22.986 --> 39:24.363
lobster.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.991
He told me when I get out...

39:28.449 --> 39:30.793
that I should find the best damn
restaurant there is...

39:30.910 --> 39:32.708
and I should try some things.

39:32.996 --> 39:36.125
You got a right to taste what
other people get to taste.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.969
He write you a check for all that?

39:40.587 --> 39:42.055
I got money.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.550
Are you inviting me to
dinner Samson?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.218
Is that what this is?

39:47.343 --> 39:48.390
Yeah.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.930
And I'll buy you some
new clothes too.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.475
And I am gonna give you a good

39:53.600 --> 39:55.273
bare naked rub.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.562
Look, I don't want you to
rub on me. Alright.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.399
It might go better between us
in that area if

40:00.523 --> 40:02.070
if you let me relax you some.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.989
There's no problem with me
in that area, alright?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.453
Everything's working fine
down there.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.245
I ain't worried about it Samson.
I just want you to relax is all.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.742
Just chill.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.869

40:24.714 --> 40:27.593
Alright, how about you dress in all black
and I dress in all white?

40:27.717 --> 40:28.513

40:28.843 --> 40:30.766
Alright, you wear white and
I'll wear black.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.273
Why? Why? Samson.

Ain't we Looking to make
some nolse?

40:37.769 --> 40:40.522
<i>Can we get one with
guts, Samson?</i>

40:40.772 --> 40:41.773
<i>With a stick.</i>

40:43.399 --> 40:45.948
Growin' up in the
Oklahoma foster homes,

40:48.279 --> 40:50.782

Especially if rip roar speeding.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.837
Here's what we could do Samson.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.849
<i>/ could be flying.</i>

41:09.717 --> 41:10.764
No.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.775
This is a beauty huh?

41:22.814 --> 41:24.816
Remember that rich
friend I told you about?

41:25.984 --> 41:29.238
He made Charlie Rankin see he
born to be something special.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.998
As to keep me in the
nothing that he was.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.666
Who's that?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.248
<i>Who's who? Charlie Rankin.</i>

41:37.412 --> 41:39.210
Just an old con I used to know.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.830
That's the one you want right?

42:26.669 --> 42:30.094
You put down your name and
license number too.

42:30.465 --> 42:31.466
No.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.059
It's all hers, it's a gift.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.613
Can't you go any faster?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.997
<i>Come on, seriously!</i>

43:03.331 --> 43:05.379

Don't you want to see what
this baby's got?

43:17.095 --> 43:18.392
W000!

43:22.642 --> 43:25.236
W000! That's it Samson.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.946
Woo ho ho!

43:38.950 --> 43:40.918
There's a zoo up ahead
we can go to.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.166
Nah.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.579
You don't like animals?

43:43.996 --> 43:45.839
Mm. Not when they're
locked up in cages.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.629
I don't like that either.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.419
But I still like seeing them.

43:50.545 --> 43:51.671
We can go on a picnic.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.140
We can go into the No we ain't goin'
countryside. On no picnic.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.930
We're going to a full blown dinner.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.428
I know we are, but it's still
too early for dinner.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.647
We got the scratch at the
surface anytime we want.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.265
It's the way it works.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.392
Alright! Keep on the expressway

44:04.517 --> 44:07.521
<i>it'll take us to the place where all
the fancy eating places are.</i>

44:08.229 --> 44:10.903
What time is it? I mean I ought
to be starved last I ate!

44:13.192 --> 44:14.114
You ain't hungry?

44:14.235 --> 44:15.236
<i>/ got a right' to be.</i>

44:16.654 --> 44:18.827
All the shit I ate last four years!

44:19.615 --> 44:22.334
Damn it, what the hell is
goin' on with me?

44:24.328 --> 44:26.001
That's okay Samson.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.249
So we'll just gonna cruise for a while.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.668
Let our appetites build.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.426
I'll be alright.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.378
You ever heard that belief
that when you die,

45:14.503 --> 45:15.675
you come back...

45:15.796 --> 45:18.049
c_ome back <i>as</i> something else,
llke a rat?

45:18.716 --> 45:19.968
You ever heard that?

45:20.509 --> 45:22.102
I wrote a poem about it.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.227
I Remember You
from the Tree Tops.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.310
You figure it happens
that way then, huh?

45:28.851 --> 45:31.570
My poem's the
only place I can't lie.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.194
Everything I feel
believes in him.

45:34.815 --> 45:35.987
Do you believe in it?

45:36.400 --> 45:37.902
Like to but...

45:38.819 --> 45:40.492
just afraid it's all bullshit.

45:40.613 --> 45:41.830
<i>What if if is .7.</i>

45:42.281 --> 45:44.158
Still doesn't hurt for you
to believe.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.958
It sure would if I killed myself
to turn into something better.

45:48.079 --> 45:50.582
Instead found myself
in eternal hell it would.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.917
That's the saddest through ever.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.010
What are you doing?

45:55.169 --> 45:56.170
I'm changing.

45:56.337 --> 45:57.429
What into?

45:57.546 --> 45:59.799
I don't know, not sure,
something cool.

46:00.925 --> 46:01.801
What happened?

46:04.011 --> 46:05.263
I got bit.

46:05.388 --> 46:06.640
What happened to you?

46:07.807 --> 46:08.558
What, here?

46:08.683 --> 46:09.775
Can't you see it?

46:10.476 --> 46:11.978
Well that's too bad.

46:12.353 --> 46:14.276
Yeah.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.120
Mm.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.190
You see that Samson?

47:26.969 --> 47:28.471
<i>He)'.</i>

47:29.221 --> 47:30.347
Hey.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.849
You see that?

48:11.097 --> 48:12.770
You want to go inside
and see it?

48:12.890 --> 48:13.766
No.

48:13.933 --> 48:15.606
Why you don't like churches?

48:16.394 --> 48:17.441
Well, you go.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.529
I can tell what it is here
and you talk, huh?

48:19.647 --> 48:22.526
No. That ain't the same Samson.

48:22.650 --> 48:25.654
Come on, I don't want
to go alone.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.313
Do you believe you
have a soul Samson?

48:59.854 --> 49:01.606
I don't know if I do.

49:01.730 --> 49:02.856
You do.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.200
You do. And it's a good one.

49:05.901 --> 49:08.154
It just ain't old like mine.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.916
What proof you got of him?

49:13.242 --> 49:14.414
/ <i>feel him.</i>

49:14.618 --> 49:16.791
Just like I feel you're
a good soul.

49:17.496 --> 49:19.544
Yeah, what's that feel like?

49:20.291 --> 49:22.339
Let him put
some of it into you.

49:24.879 --> 49:25.880
Talk to him.

49:26.005 --> 49:27.097
About what?

49:27.715 --> 49:29.638
<i>Tell h/m how you a/n '1'
got no appetite,</i>

49:29.758 --> 49:30.930
<i>your stomach hu/Ts,</i>

49:31.719 --> 49:33.562
<i>and ask him to make it
stop hu/T/n'.</i>

49:43.189 --> 49:45.533
All my life I...

49:47.443 --> 49:50.037
from what I can remember of it,
I'd be dreaming,

49:51.071 --> 49:53.494
about hurting and killing
the people that hurt me.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.334
When I was younger
that made me feel better until

50:01.081 --> 50:04.335
I'd wake up
and they were all still alive.

50:05.878 --> 50:07.596
Those dreams were my secret.

50:10.424 --> 50:12.301
I told the Buddha about them.

50:13.219 --> 50:16.393
Tell God it ain't your dreams
making your belly sick.

50:17.097 --> 50:19.099
Could have come across
Tell him you don't know how you

50:19.225 --> 50:20.693
holding the
money that you are...

50:21.727 --> 50:24.526
and the cuts on
your arms and face.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.566
What do you know about me?

50:28.984 --> 50:32.909
Just that your soul is in
so much pain Samson.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.160
No, I asked him.

50:38.953 --> 50:41.502
I asked im for help when I
needed him when I was younger.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.632
He gave me nothing.

50:44.833 --> 50:48.588
He don't always answer you Samson,
how and when you think he will.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.185
I ain't going in anymore
fucking churches.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.558
It's you driving us.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.310
I'm just waiting for
you to feel better

51:02.434 --> 51:04.277
so you pan take
me to dinner Samson.

51:04.853 --> 51:06.025
And to make love to me

51:06.105 --> 51:08.199
just a little bit longer
than you did earlier.

51:36.051 --> 51:38.224
<i>The scars on your back.</i>

51:39.305 --> 51:41.307
<i>Are the y're your dream too?</i>

52:14.256 --> 52:16.008
I gotta see someone in there.

52:17.009 --> 52:18.101
MQS?

52:18.177 --> 52:19.679
You know him?

52:21.221 --> 52:22.973
You spend time in
that shit hole?

52:25.476 --> 52:27.319
Back when I was young.

52:28.729 --> 52:31.858
Hasn't everyone had a
"Mos" phase growing up, huh?

52:33.233 --> 52:34.200
Jeez.

52:34.318 --> 52:35.661
/ <i>hope not.</i>

52:36.904 --> 52:38.827
<i>It's a wonder to me you
lived this long...</i>

52:38.989 --> 52:41.287
<i>reckless way you go about it.</i>

52:44.119 --> 52:47.123
I'd certainly not live at all
than live like you do Samson.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.045
Not trusting a soul.

52:49.625 --> 52:51.798
Not even the one inside you.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.594
Yeah.

52:57.424 --> 52:59.722
You know a guy named
Lorne Corral?

53:06.809 --> 53:09.232
Did he get you into this
business of last night?

53:10.354 --> 53:11.731
Can't say.

53:12.439 --> 53:13.440
I'll be back.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.411
Don't be gone long.

54:06.785 --> 54:08.128
Hey!

54:34.438 --> 54:36.440
You lose something?

55:06.220 --> 55:07.847
You want to tell me...

55:08.055 --> 55:09.728
what went wrong last night?

55:15.312 --> 55:16.689
Who told you that?

55:17.147 --> 55:18.569
You did.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.119
You know what they say?

55:23.362 --> 55:25.990
Eyes are the windows
to the soul.

55:27.533 --> 55:30.286
You gotta learn
how to draw your curtains.

55:38.043 --> 55:39.886
There was someone else there.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.005
There was a woman there.

55:42.130 --> 55:43.052
His wife?

55:43.173 --> 55:45.050
No, some blonde.

55:45.217 --> 55:46.184
And?

55:48.512 --> 55:49.934
And I tied her up.

55:50.097 --> 55:51.189
She wasn't going nowhere.

55:51.306 --> 55:52.478
Charlie.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.360
She didn't see me, alright,
I was wearing a mask.

55:55.477 --> 55:56.524
It's fine.

55:57.479 --> 56:00.824
There are other ways
to tell who you are.

56:08.156 --> 56:10.124
What do you want me to do now?

56:13.537 --> 56:15.039
Kill that voice.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.302
Just do it.

56:48.155 --> 56:49.657
<i>Hey there Samson.</i>

56:52.367 --> 56:53.334
Everything okay?

56:54.578 --> 56:55.955
Yeah, let's go.

57:26.026 --> 57:27.152
Samson.

57:27.319 --> 57:28.616
Mm?

57:29.404 --> 57:30.906
Bridge is clear.

57:39.331 --> 57:40.674
Take a left up here.

57:40.791 --> 57:41.667
What for?

57:43.043 --> 57:45.796
T_here's a par, we can
klll some tlme at.

57:46.213 --> 57:48.307
Till you get your appetite back.

58:17.494 --> 58:19.917
You're <i>as</i> pale as a ghost.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.005
You have to eat
something Samson.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.276
Barman.

58:42.602 --> 58:43.899
One more.

59:08.295 --> 59:10.047
I gotta go somewhere.

59:10.464 --> 59:11.807
I'll be back.

59:12.507 --> 59:14.259
It was nice knowing you.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.019
I said I'll be back.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.346
Sure.

59:42.788 --> 59:44.381
<i>49/11!</i>

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.611
<i>/ thought you said you
were leaving?</i>

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.079
One more.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.338
<i>Use the door.</i>

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.923
Time for us to go.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.760
It's "us" now huh?

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.350
We can drink somewhere else.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.812
Why don't you cool it man?

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.101
Hey, did you hear me?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:47.610
Coming?

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:47.921
<i>J' If you ever think about me...</i>

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:54.629
<i>J' /f / ever cross your mind.</i>

01:01:56.588 --> 01:02:02.812
<i>J' Girl, Girl, If you ever think about me...</i>

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:09.276
<i>J' /f / ever cross your mind.</i>

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.698
<i>J' Well you know, you know I'm yours.</i>

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.858
<i>J' you know I'm yours.</i>

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.445
<i>FiAnd / know,</i>

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.618
<i>J' / know you're mine.</i>

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:29.789
I never have much liked a woman
before, anybody.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.882
Sure do you like you though,
Florence.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.922
Tell me something I don't know.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.847
Charlie Rankin...

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.397
some old timer I told you about.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.103
Charlie Rankin?

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:54.984
He wasn't shit until the Buddha
took an interest in him.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.066
Buddha got him talking again...

01:02:58.275 --> 01:02:59.902
made Charlie who he is.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.575
He saved Charlie's life?

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.964
Why would the cops know to come
looking for you in this car?

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:17.502
What?

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.221
Unless you done something the cops
might want to talk to you about.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:29.457
You got it all wrong about what's
gonna happen in this life.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:32.119
<i>/ don't got a crystal ball Samson.</i>

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.170
I don't see the future,

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:35.914
all I see is you so
twisted up inside

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:37.916
and me taking a chance on you.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:43.471
Well I aim to live
as long as I can.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.428
It's good you're back
to wanting to.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.974
What I gotta do to live ain't what
most people gotta do.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.848
You talking a
bout being the finger

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.774
at the end of
Buddha's long arm?

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:05.944
Can't take his money
and just walk away.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.075
Is that what you did?

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:13.376
<i>Is that What this ride
and this belly ache is all about?</i>

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.009
No peeking.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:37.710
Fuck Charlie, come on man.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.767
Do I rev you up more this way?

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.188
What the fuck?

01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.565
What are you doing?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.062
What's wrong Samson?

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.651
You don't like it?

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.615
My God...

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.818
you're burning up.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.245
Poison me or something?

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.492
What'd you do?

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.083
The bad is bottled up
in you Samson,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.497
its poisoned you.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.586
I knew this was coming.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.334
Florence?

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.090
What are you doin?

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.084
I keep trying to warn you
stay away from me.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.256
I can feel in your skin

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.425
what a beautiful baby you were.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.014
I keep trying to warn you.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.636
About what?

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.471
About who I am.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.519
I know who you are.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.230
I wouldn't be here if I didn't
know who you are Samson.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.098
Yeah, you don't.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:41.850
I'm Charlie.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.608
And I'm Florence.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.906
I'm Florence.

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.285
I know who you are.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.366
But I came here to kill
someone.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.458
Who did you come here to kill'?

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:01.418
Huh?

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:05.214
It don't matter who.
It does matter.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.628
It don't fuckin' matter.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.342
It will to whoever you do it to.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.133
It'll make you sicker
and sicker.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.382
I don't feel good.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.634
Come here.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.010
Let me just hold you.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:21.059
You hold me. Charlie.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.272
My baby.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:32.658
Who are you?

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.156
Jesus!

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.537
Keep fucking doing this to me!

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:38.993
Where'd you get this hair, huh?

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.662
Where'd you get that, huh?

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.379
You tell me who you are.
I'm tired of this shit.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:45.667
You tell me now!

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.466
Are you her? Are you Florence?

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:51.465
Are you?

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.511
Who are you?

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.555
Are you real?

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.478
Get inside me and feel better.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:03.814
I don't want to
be like this anymore.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:08.778
Get inside me.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.012
I can tell by watching you sleep

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:19.929
you go to a
scary place Charlie.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.348
Do you know where that is?

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.650
You look some better anyway.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.906
And I love you no matter.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:46.993
You love me?

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.295
Huh?

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.926
I don't think I'm made
for that Florence.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.644
Everyone is.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.153
You just get somebody to
teach you.

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:20.152
You think I can forget about what I...

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.911
what I dealt with growing up.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.202
Well you're wrong.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:28.000
You're wrong.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.415
You talking about Chester?

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:37.927
How do you know about him?

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.925
Only about the battle you spoke
of in your sleep.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.969
That was the nonsense
of a dream.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:52.608
The scars on your back...

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:55.694
they your dream too?

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.451
I'm gonna go to the next town.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.112
I'm gonna drop you there.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.619
No you won't.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:14.001
I think I know why you're here
more than you do Charlie.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.518
Are you scared?

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.028
Just follow
your instincts Charlie.

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:30.160
They'll take you
to the right place

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:31.908
and make you do
the right thing.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.220
Do you want me to
come with you?

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.516
No.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.356
Should I come to the
door with you?

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.150
Will that make it easier?

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.547
This state ain't got the
death penalty Charlie.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:07.383
I read that in the newspaper.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.628
I'm going to do your
feet here, alright.

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:44.757
When you're out there,
walking just listen okay?

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:48.840
Just trust.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.301
Just trust what you hear.

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.966
I think I mightjust dream it.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.387
No don't dream.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.930
Dreams don't matter.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.726
This matters.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.682
Right here.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.309
Right now.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.112
Put your hands
behind your back.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.241
Lean forward.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.873
Was me who wanted to
come with you,

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.083
Why would I leave you?

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.932
Don't be scared Florence.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.480
Don't you be Charlie.

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:13.924
Are you the police?

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.227
Did you see him?

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:33.978
He killed him in front of me.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:36.814
I tried to stop him.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.950
He was too strong.

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:43.988
I'll be right back.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:02.924
Some water.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.719
Some Aspirin for your pain.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.767
You're a doctor?

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:14.359
No.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:15.860
I could call one?

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.615
I don't feel good.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.664
Those scars?

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.832
How did you get the scars?

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:30.667
What scars?

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.536
On your hand.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:35.873
That's all long time ago.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:38.459
I was just a kid.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.762
There were scars...
