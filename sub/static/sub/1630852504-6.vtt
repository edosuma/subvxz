WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.065
Are you saying that you used
my kid in a case today

00:03.100 --> 00:04.461
and that's why
he had drugs on him,

00:04.496 --> 00:05.725
is that what
you're saying to me?

00:05.760 --> 00:07.263
Her name's
jackie sullivan.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.725
You can never
see her again.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.692
Roxy,
you got to keep it clean,

00:11.727 --> 00:12.758
you got to stay out of trouble.

00:12.793 --> 00:14.362
And, hey, no guns.

00:14.397 --> 00:15.758
I need a 96 beretta.

00:15.793 --> 00:17.593
I need it to scare
my man, all right?

00:17.628 --> 00:19.560
You had a boyfriend
point a gun in your face?

00:19.595 --> 00:21.395
When they do finally
give me my job back,

00:21.430 --> 00:22.824
you can't abandon me, okay?

00:22.859 --> 00:24.725
You know that deangelas
case, right...

00:24.760 --> 00:26.362
That I work with keegan?

00:26.397 --> 00:28.659
Well, we had hidden
cameras in every room.

00:36.529 --> 00:38.560
Hey, uh,

00:38.595 --> 00:40.527
you need any help
cleaning up or-

00:40.562 --> 00:42.131
no, no.
You can't clean.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.461
I'm good.
I got it.

00:44.496 --> 00:46.065
Son, let me give you a hand-

00:46.100 --> 00:47.527
shoes!

00:47.562 --> 00:49.263
I just cleaned
the floors, please.

00:49.298 --> 00:51.197
C'mon, I don't
want you to be upset.

00:51.232 --> 00:53.296
Oh, I'm not upset.
I'm good, really.

00:53.331 --> 00:56.362
I can do like,
lots of stuff now.

00:56.397 --> 00:57.791
I can listen
to my own music,

00:57.826 --> 00:58.759
which is going
to be awesome,

00:58.794 --> 01:01.197
on my own speakers that
I bought my own self

01:01.232 --> 01:02.560
with my own money.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.362
I'm going to bring something
up right now, actually.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.527
You guys are going to love
this, it's from the 90s.

01:06.793 --> 01:08.659
Oh yeah, do you
remember this one?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.593
Oh no, no, no.

01:10.628 --> 01:12.362
Of course you wouldn't,
because I hadn't had all

01:12.397 --> 01:14.824
the protein and marrow
sucked out of my bones

01:14.859 --> 01:16.857
and teeth when I made you.

01:16.892 --> 01:18.593
This song hadn't
hit the charts...

01:18.628 --> 01:22.197
Oh, I hadn't had
the old vagina just ripped open

01:22.232 --> 01:25.461
in the process
of giving you life.

01:25.496 --> 01:27.791
Hey, if I'm old enough
to spend the night in jail,

01:27.826 --> 01:30.362
I can make my own
decisions about

01:30.397 --> 01:33.329
where I want to live

01:33.364 --> 01:35.197
and who I want
to date, right?

01:35.232 --> 01:36.593
Mom?

01:36.628 --> 01:39.428
Elliott, let's go.

01:39.463 --> 01:41.263
Yeah, why don't you
go with your father?

01:41.298 --> 01:42.791
You should probably
go with him.

01:42.826 --> 01:45.560
Because he's been such a present
and attentive parent

01:45.595 --> 01:48.395
these past seven years.

01:48.430 --> 01:52.659
<i>♪ let it rain on me ♪</i>

01:52.694 --> 01:54.560
nice moves.

01:57.199 --> 01:59.329
He'll be back,
this'll blow over.

01:59.364 --> 02:00.890
Maybe he just
needs some space.

02:00.925 --> 02:02.428
Yeah.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.527
Like father,
like son, I guess.

02:09.166 --> 02:13.362
<i>♪ I have been a witness</i>
to a perfect crime ♪

02:15.463 --> 02:20.428
<i>♪ wipe the grin off of</i>
my face to hide the blame ♪

02:21.892 --> 02:25.692
so, are you going to tell me
what's going on, or...?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.428
What?

02:34.463 --> 02:36.230
You want one?

02:36.265 --> 02:38.659
I saw the surveillance footage.

02:38.694 --> 02:40.230
Of?

02:40.265 --> 02:41.461
Don't make this
hard, keegan.

02:41.496 --> 02:42.824
See, I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:45.463 --> 02:47.527
The deangelis case.

02:47.562 --> 02:50.758
The 10 seconds
before I came in...

02:50.793 --> 02:52.791
Or two minutes, actually.

02:54.628 --> 02:57.461
There was no footage
from the deangelis case.

02:57.496 --> 03:00.659
What did you do?

03:00.694 --> 03:03.296
You go hunting
around for this?

03:03.331 --> 03:05.890
You lied to me.

03:05.925 --> 03:08.527
To shanks,
to your squad, to everyone.

03:08.562 --> 03:09.890
I lost my temper.

03:09.925 --> 03:13.923
I had to lie to save
our play, okay?

03:13.958 --> 03:16.494
That would've meant all
our work, the whole thing,

03:16.529 --> 03:18.923
what we did together,
your work undercover...

03:18.958 --> 03:20.956
Don't you dare say
you did this for me.

03:20.991 --> 03:23.593
Oh, come on, kelly.
The guy was guilty.

03:23.628 --> 03:26.329
He was guilty,
and he's a scumbag,

03:26.364 --> 03:29.230
and he's in jail now
where he should be,

03:29.265 --> 03:30.298
because of us.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.725
But you beat up a kid
and then you lied about it,

03:33.760 --> 03:36.692
and you put me in the position
where I can't protect you.

03:38.463 --> 03:39.824
Serve and protect,
you remember that?

03:39.859 --> 03:41.362
That's what you taught me.

03:41.397 --> 03:42.824
You can't protect me?

03:45.628 --> 03:48.197
You're supposed
to be my partner.

03:48.232 --> 03:50.329
We got a code.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.923
Now you're going to turn
your back on me?

03:52.958 --> 03:54.461
How many times
I had your back, huh?

03:54.496 --> 03:57.197
-This is different.
-No, it's not.

03:57.232 --> 04:00.626
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be

04:00.661 --> 04:02.461
hiding in a closet while len
kicked the hell out of you.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.989
You better do
the right thing

04:15.024 --> 04:16.791
and get ahead of this
and tell the truth.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.758
Because if you don't,
then I will.

05:17.496 --> 05:19.494
so I guess you're
talking to me again?

05:19.529 --> 05:22.659
I'm still mad at you,
just more mad at elliott.

05:22.694 --> 05:24.659
Plus, he moved out

05:24.694 --> 05:28.296
and I can't stand being
in that house alone.

05:28.331 --> 05:31.890
You're like,
the only other person I know

05:31.925 --> 05:33.659
who doesn't have a life, so...

05:36.331 --> 05:38.857
Hey, feast your
eyes on this.

05:40.430 --> 05:43.395
Uniforms found at the old church
roxy was squatting in.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.329
Wait, is it a
black-market kidney?

05:45.364 --> 05:46.890
Because maybe I'll
just sit this one out.

05:46.925 --> 05:48.329
Come see for yourself.

05:53.826 --> 05:55.758
You gotta press it,
it's like one of the...

05:55.793 --> 05:57.329
Did you have coffee
or something?

05:57.364 --> 05:58.791
Six.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.362
-Wow.
-Yes!

06:00.397 --> 06:01.824
-And these are roxy's?
-Yep.

06:01.859 --> 06:04.659
I guess she's our friendly
neighbourhood gun runner.

06:04.694 --> 06:05.725
Wow.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.527
This way...
That way...

06:07.562 --> 06:10.659
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

06:10.694 --> 06:13.560

06:24.760 --> 06:25.956
ms. Benson, we have a few
questions for your client.

06:25.991 --> 06:27.527
Like?

06:27.562 --> 06:29.362
Like why did we find
a cooler full of weapons

06:29.397 --> 06:30.923
in her squat all registered
to a defunct chicago

06:30.958 --> 06:33.461
gun store called
nation of ammo?

06:33.496 --> 06:35.065
Operative word being, "squat."

06:35.100 --> 06:36.923
those guns could
belong to anyone.

06:36.958 --> 06:38.692
Except, the only prints
on them are roxy's,

06:38.727 --> 06:41.461
so we're going to have to
assume she owns all of them.

06:41.496 --> 06:42.857
Plus one more.

06:44.562 --> 06:46.593
Isaiah jones,
12-years-old,

06:46.628 --> 06:48.626
killed in a stockwood
drive-by four months ago.

06:48.661 --> 06:51.593
Gun on the scene was also
registered to nation of ammo.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.494
Mm, looks like someone's going
to be an accessory to murder.

06:54.529 --> 06:55.923
Mm-hmm.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.560
Unless they tell us exactly
where they got those weapons.

07:03.067 --> 07:06.428
Let's imagine my
client was a person

07:06.463 --> 07:09.395
who came into possession
of some black-market weapons.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.032
Let's say she
considered selling them

07:11.067 --> 07:12.989
to other desperate souls
who, for whatever reason,

07:13.024 --> 07:14.725
felt like they needed
to wave a gun around

07:14.760 --> 07:16.824
to be taken seriously.

07:16.859 --> 07:18.527
You could go after her
or you could go after

07:18.562 --> 07:22.560
the much more dangerous
humans supplying to her

07:22.595 --> 07:24.725
and dozens of others.

07:26.991 --> 07:28.593
Crown will drop
the sentence to six months

07:28.628 --> 07:30.824
if she gives up
her gun source.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.461
Um, awkward silence
is not going to shave

07:40.496 --> 07:42.659
four-and-a-half years off your
time, will it, wazowski?

07:42.694 --> 07:43.923
No, it really won't.

07:50.529 --> 07:51.593
Okay.

07:52.991 --> 07:55.527
Apparently...

07:55.562 --> 07:59.692
Phone a guy, leave 1000 bucks
in the public toilet

07:59.727 --> 08:02.791
across from the epic
bingo in mississauga,

08:02.826 --> 08:04.098
guy leaves a gun.

08:05.265 --> 08:06.692
Like in the back of the toilet,
in the bowl where you-

08:06.727 --> 08:08.461
in the back.

08:08.496 --> 08:10.725
Guy's name?

08:12.562 --> 08:15.494
Goes by siff. Gets
a new burner every month.

08:17.661 --> 08:18.659
Thank you.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.725
She wasn't specific,
to be clear.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.098
She just said the public toilet,
so it's possible

08:26.133 --> 08:27.266
that it could've been
left in the bowl.

08:27.301 --> 08:29.164
Hey jacks, can you pick up
sol from school later,

08:29.199 --> 08:30.659
take him to maureen's?

08:30.694 --> 08:32.527
Hey.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.824
Hello.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.824
No, why are you
assaulting me?

08:36.859 --> 08:37.989
Oh, assault?

08:38.024 --> 08:39.593
Removing your
headphones is assault?

08:39.628 --> 08:40.727
Yes, actually.

08:40.763 --> 08:42.032
It's unwanted touching
and if you don't give it back,

08:42.067 --> 08:43.428
it's robbery.

08:43.463 --> 08:46.527
what's the matter, baby?

08:46.562 --> 08:47.857
Is it the cop's kid?

08:47.892 --> 08:49.890
No.

08:51.199 --> 08:53.659
Come here. Sit up.

08:53.694 --> 08:55.428
Come here.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.725
When I was 16,

09:02.760 --> 09:07.065
I saw a picture of ivana trump
in this prada dress.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.923
She was standing
next to donald

09:09.958 --> 09:12.725
who, you know, back then,
you could almost look at

09:12.760 --> 09:13.791
without throwing up.

09:13.826 --> 09:15.164
Stop.

09:15.199 --> 09:16.923
almost.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.560
I remember thinking,

09:19.595 --> 09:23.659
"I wish I had a millionaire
husband to buy me that dress."

09:27.991 --> 09:30.527
for so long baby,
for years,

09:30.562 --> 09:33.560
I poured my energy
into helping men succeed.

09:33.595 --> 09:37.065
But what I needed

09:37.100 --> 09:39.890
was to pour some of that
energy into myself...

09:42.067 --> 09:43.758
Buy my own damn dress.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.230
You're a tiger, baby,
not a kitten.

09:48.265 --> 09:50.758
And you're nobody's pet.

09:53.991 --> 09:55.494
You want something?

09:55.529 --> 09:56.999
Go get it.

10:01.265 --> 10:03.494
This is nation of ammo.

10:03.529 --> 10:04.824
And this is levin kaplan,
former owner,

10:04.859 --> 10:06.230
he died last year.

10:06.265 --> 10:08.758
His widow, hannah, has no
idea where the inventory went.

10:08.793 --> 10:09.956
Looked into her,
spotless record.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.593
She's never even
been to canada.

10:11.628 --> 10:12.890
I got in touch
with the dealer.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.560
Swap's set for
tomorrow morning.

10:14.595 --> 10:16.164
My man.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.065
Yeah, my man... As well...

10:19.100 --> 10:20.494
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

10:20.529 --> 10:21.989
You will do the drop in
the men's restroom,

10:22.024 --> 10:23.263
hamm and I are going
to watch and wait.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.032
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No can do, samwich.

10:25.067 --> 10:27.131
I got my ds interview
tomorrow morning

10:27.166 --> 10:29.032
so you are on your own.

10:29.067 --> 10:31.923
My days of cruising bathrooms
will soon be behind me.

10:31.958 --> 10:34.791
Okay, well looks like
it's just us, chickens.

10:36.265 --> 10:38.296
okay, let's do
the old to-do list, gang.

10:38.331 --> 10:40.197
Me, 7:00 am,
I will gather the money,

10:40.232 --> 10:41.659
I will put it
in a big ziploc,

10:41.694 --> 10:43.230
I will bring the car,
I got to get gas,

10:43.265 --> 10:44.956
so that means, duff,
you're bringing the...

10:46.793 --> 10:48.131
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

10:54.331 --> 10:55.758
I can't believe he has to
leave the money in the toilet.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.527
I've given him some
hand sanitizer.

11:03.199 --> 11:04.659
God, could you stop that?

11:04.694 --> 11:06.065
Well, I don't
want to waste it.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.890
But can't you just eat
what's inside the cup?

11:07.925 --> 11:09.659
Oh my god, what are you,
the food police?

11:09.694 --> 11:11.725
I have an idea, how about
actual police work? Eyes on.

11:30.793 --> 11:34.593
I've decided
I'm going to tell shanks

11:34.628 --> 11:37.824
about elliot and jackie.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.890
Okay. Nice knowing you.

11:42.925 --> 11:45.032
I got to get it out there, can't
keep it bottled up, you know?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.626
I want to clear the air,
you should try it some time.

11:46.661 --> 11:47.923
What are you
talking about?

11:47.958 --> 11:50.329
Something is bothering you,
I know that.

11:50.364 --> 11:52.758
Come on.
Okay, let me guess.

11:52.793 --> 11:55.164
You and nathan broke up.

11:55.199 --> 11:58.032
Am I hot? Am I cold?
Am I warm? I bet I'm warm.

11:58.067 --> 11:59.758
I'm warm, aren't I?
I'm really warm.

11:59.793 --> 12:01.362
I'm probably hot.
Is that what it is?

12:01.397 --> 12:03.890
We're not together enough
to break up, okay?

12:07.958 --> 12:09.329
Look at that.

12:10.892 --> 12:13.098
Seriously, though.
Like, I tell you everything.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.329
Like, I'm thinking it,
I feel it, I'm like...

12:15.892 --> 12:16.824
and I tell you.
You don't tell me anything.

12:16.859 --> 12:17.858
You know everything
about me.

12:17.894 --> 12:21.131
Who says I want to know
those things, though?

12:24.298 --> 12:25.989
Hey, naz, someone's
heading in.

12:26.024 --> 12:27.758
Keep your eyes open.

12:37.265 --> 12:39.230
naz, what's happening?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.230
He handed me the drop.
Grab him.

12:48.265 --> 12:49.296
Let's go.

12:52.298 --> 12:54.197
Hey, police.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.395
Get your hands up.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.725
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Slow down. Don't you...

12:57.760 --> 12:58.956
Come back here.

12:58.991 --> 13:00.659
Freeze.

13:00.694 --> 13:01.692
Drop the phone.

13:01.727 --> 13:02.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hands.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.725
Don't eat it.

13:06.331 --> 13:07.956
Did he just
eat a sim card?

13:13.024 --> 13:14.989
What do you want me to say?
I don't know what to tell you.

13:15.024 --> 13:17.923
I'm not a gun dealer
and I don't have a client list.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.758
Oh, I see, you just
really enjoy the taste

13:19.793 --> 13:21.659
of sim card
in the morning.

13:21.694 --> 13:23.197
Yusuf, I am not
letting you leave here

13:23.232 --> 13:24.791
with all
the information I need

13:24.826 --> 13:26.197
swimming around
in your guts.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.989
If I have to, I'll go
fishing around in the...

13:29.024 --> 13:31.890
You know... For names.

13:31.925 --> 13:34.296
I will do it, okay?

13:34.331 --> 13:37.989
So you can either
just get things moving,

13:38.024 --> 13:40.230
which will be very unpleasant
for both of us, mostly for me.

13:40.265 --> 13:42.890
Or you could just tell me
how many guns you sold,

13:42.925 --> 13:44.890
who you sold them to
besides roxy morales.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.263
What is this?
Offering him a muffin...

13:47.298 --> 13:49.164
What's she going to do next,
make him a souffle?

13:49.199 --> 13:51.197
Just let sam do her thing.

13:51.232 --> 13:55.362
<i>5, 10, 20? 50?</i>
You sold 50 guns?

13:55.397 --> 13:57.164
I'm still waiting for
your keegan statement.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.131
If you want your partner back,
you need to write that letter.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.890
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it.

14:07.826 --> 14:10.263
<i>It is biologically unsafe</i>
to hold it in for so long.

14:10.298 --> 14:11.758
Did you know
you can get something

14:11.793 --> 14:13.131
called fecal impaction?

14:13.166 --> 14:16.395
Yeah. Also, megarectum.

14:16.430 --> 14:18.263
That's real,
looked it up on the web.

14:18.298 --> 14:21.098
Megarectum... What is...?

14:21.133 --> 14:22.692
Okay, fine. Go.

14:22.727 --> 14:24.230
Wazowski,
can you step out please?

14:24.265 --> 14:27.758
Do not gloat.
Don't do it.

14:29.298 --> 14:31.164
-What?
-Megarectum?

14:31.199 --> 14:33.329
Yeah, megarectum.

14:33.364 --> 14:34.890
let me show you how to do this.

14:37.397 --> 14:39.263
-What's going on?
-Kelly's turn.

14:39.298 --> 14:41.131
Just let her scare
the sim card out of him,

14:41.166 --> 14:43.923
then you go back in
and get it done by the book.

14:43.958 --> 14:44.999
Speaking of by the book...

14:49.397 --> 14:51.791
My son elliot is dating one of
our confidential informants,

14:51.826 --> 14:53.032
jackie sullivan.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.725
-Oh, god.
-Oh, I know, I know. I know.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.098
It's okay.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.494
They met randomly online
and I had no idea

15:00.529 --> 15:02.857
and I just found out.

15:02.892 --> 15:05.362
Does your son have
any access to your files,

15:05.397 --> 15:06.956
your work, your information?

15:06.991 --> 15:08.428
No, no.
He doesn't.

15:08.463 --> 15:10.890
My work has not
been compromised.

15:10.925 --> 15:14.461
Listen, if you have to
take this upstairs,

15:14.496 --> 15:16.230
I understand.

15:22.298 --> 15:24.032
I was already thinking
of taking jackie sullivan

15:24.067 --> 15:27.032
out of the system after
the church party fiasco,

15:27.067 --> 15:29.824
so thanks for
making my mind up.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.296
Your boy isn't going to
become trouble, is he?

15:34.331 --> 15:35.296
No, he won't.

15:35.331 --> 15:37.263
Good.

15:37.298 --> 15:39.890
Oh, kids are a real
weak spot, aren't they?

15:39.925 --> 15:41.428
Yeah.

15:43.529 --> 15:45.263
I just... I have...
If you wait...

15:49.364 --> 15:50.463
How about this?

15:50.499 --> 15:54.362
How about you tell me who
you're selling guns to asap?

15:54.397 --> 15:57.164
Asap or what?

15:57.199 --> 15:59.263
Or I'm about to unleash
a whole bunch

15:59.298 --> 16:01.197
of other acronyms on you.

16:01.232 --> 16:03.890
See, your canadian work
visa is about to expire

16:03.925 --> 16:05.296
and, well, with
crime like this,

16:05.331 --> 16:08.197
that'll get you sent
back to the usa

16:08.232 --> 16:11.263
by the doj and you'll
be sol in mcc.

16:11.298 --> 16:13.428
And don't forget
about the k-I-d.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.131
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to leave that behind.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.032
Got to love social media.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.923
That your boy?
About 10 years old?

16:22.331 --> 16:24.989
I just want to know what he's
going to look like when he's 25,

16:25.024 --> 16:26.230
because that's the next time
you're going to see him.

16:28.991 --> 16:31.824
Unless you tell us how
many guns you've sold

16:31.859 --> 16:33.197
and who you sold them to,
and make sure you stay

16:33.232 --> 16:35.065
in canada for
your sentencing.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.362
Yeah. At least you could
see your kid on the weekends.

16:48.265 --> 16:51.230
The guns belong to
my uncle in chicago.

16:51.265 --> 16:53.032
He got sick, he had
to close the store.

16:53.067 --> 16:56.197
When he died, my aunt
needed help paying the bills.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.560
I brought the guns up here,
when I sold them,

16:58.595 --> 17:00.428
I would keep half the money
for myself but I would send

17:00.463 --> 17:02.890
the other half down to her,
to help my aunt.

17:02.925 --> 17:06.098
I can give you guys
a link to my inventory list

17:06.133 --> 17:08.923
but I do not know
how to find these guys.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.890
All their numbers are...

17:18.430 --> 17:19.494
Then drink up.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.164
What...

17:30.199 --> 17:31.824
Jesus.

17:31.859 --> 17:33.857
Layna?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.362
Disgusting.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.593
Oh man.

17:47.628 --> 17:49.428
-Hi.
-Oh.

17:49.463 --> 17:51.362
Hi, tig.

17:51.397 --> 17:53.527
Don't, "oh. Hi, tig" me.

17:53.562 --> 17:55.131
You're not supposed
to leave this room.

17:55.166 --> 17:58.032
You're hiding from
the cops, remember?

17:58.067 --> 17:59.395
What the hell
were you two doing?

17:59.430 --> 18:00.923
Running some errands.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.857
We borrowed mrs. Bruce's car
and no one even saw us

18:02.892 --> 18:04.527
because we're stealthy.

18:04.562 --> 18:06.362
Until he crashed it
into a ditch, but...

18:06.397 --> 18:08.560
It's fine,
mrs. Bruce is dead.

18:08.595 --> 18:11.923
Not because
of the crash, aright?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.362
It's cancer.

18:13.397 --> 18:14.923
The car's been sitting in
her driveway for over a year.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.329
No one's even going
to notice it's gone.

18:16.364 --> 18:18.098
What is wrong
with you two?

18:18.133 --> 18:19.527
We're on molly.
You want some?

18:19.562 --> 18:21.461
-No, I don't want some.
-You should.

18:21.496 --> 18:23.362
I tracked this guy
down who sells this...

18:23.397 --> 18:25.362
Makes it himself up north.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.527
It's crazy good,
I got to tell you.

18:27.562 --> 18:29.098
Crazy good.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.659
It is. So listen.
Listen to this, okay.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.131
I got this idea,
all right?

18:34.166 --> 18:37.098
We need to go into business
with this guy bad,

18:37.133 --> 18:38.164
all right?

18:38.199 --> 18:40.032
Import coke,
export the molly.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.065
Two trips down
to the us, boom.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.131
We don't even have
to deal with misiano.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.527
Oh, okay. Great idea.

18:46.562 --> 18:49.164
Here, why don't you see
how much you can get with this?

18:49.199 --> 18:52.923
That is the money
I pay you to work for me

18:52.958 --> 18:54.131
to sell cocaine,

18:54.166 --> 18:55.593
to pay off misiano.

18:55.628 --> 18:57.065
All right?

18:57.100 --> 19:00.197
Not to run around doing drugs,
having ideas.

19:00.232 --> 19:03.329
-I'm not your employee, tig.
-No, you're my bitch.

19:03.364 --> 19:05.230
You want the rest
of your $1000 a week?

19:05.265 --> 19:07.065
Do your job.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.131
And clean this place up,
it's disgusting.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.890
And you, get it together.

19:14.628 --> 19:16.461
Is that how much
she pays you?

19:19.430 --> 19:22.461
My god. For a criminal,
he's so very organized.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.131
I'm very impressed.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.626
Is that wrong to think
it's a bit sexy?

19:26.661 --> 19:28.527
Because in another lifetime,
I don't know...

19:28.562 --> 19:30.560
Probably...

19:30.595 --> 19:32.197
It's been too long.
I'm so sorry.

19:32.232 --> 19:34.395
We have to find 77 guns?

19:34.430 --> 19:36.065
What are they doing,
trying to start a war?

19:37.727 --> 19:39.626
-Oh...
-Wow.

19:39.661 --> 19:42.329
You might want to give it
a minute before you go in there.

19:42.364 --> 19:45.197
That's all right.
I have a teenage son.

19:47.024 --> 19:48.296
Walk.

19:54.595 --> 19:57.065
Come on, baby.
Please work, please work.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.164
Yes.

20:02.199 --> 20:04.296
Oh, wow.
I cannot believe that worked.

20:04.331 --> 20:05.497
Fun fact...

20:05.532 --> 20:07.560
Stomach acid has very little
effect on technology, so...

20:07.595 --> 20:09.032
Okay.

20:09.067 --> 20:10.593
Plan of attack, to match
yusuf's call histories.

20:10.628 --> 20:13.197
The closest date of sale
on his inventory list,

20:13.232 --> 20:14.494
that would get the target
and what they bought.

20:14.529 --> 20:15.428
Here, let me show you.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.362
No, get your own copy
there, poopy mitts.

20:18.397 --> 20:20.593
They don't smell. Give it.
I washed my hands.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.395
Okay, look.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.461
On the 14th, someone
named regent called,

20:25.496 --> 20:28.560
and on the 15th, there's
sale of a glock and a p320.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.989
Maybe this regent
has those guns.

20:31.024 --> 20:32.659
Yeah, but who
the hell is regent?

20:32.694 --> 20:34.098
Who are any of these guys?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.263
Look at these names...

20:35.298 --> 20:37.758
Flinch, cappin, heat.

20:37.793 --> 20:39.263
They're gang handles.

20:39.298 --> 20:41.362
Okay, well, maybe
the numbers are traceable.

20:41.397 --> 20:43.296
Yeah, you better hope so.

20:43.331 --> 20:45.230
Otherwise, you just
stuck your hand in doody

20:45.265 --> 20:46.626
for a bunch of nothing.

20:46.661 --> 20:47.725
I don't think it smells-

20:47.760 --> 20:49.197
I will shoot you.

20:49.232 --> 20:50.758
Can you smell that?

20:50.793 --> 20:53.197
Nope. Gross, wazowski.

20:59.364 --> 21:00.494
Kobe.

21:00.529 --> 21:02.494
Still got it.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.296
Okay, come on. We're almost
there, we're almost there.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.626
Okay, okay.

21:09.364 --> 21:12.692
Um, this callum o'malley
dude is still mia.

21:12.727 --> 21:15.560
He was a military engineer

21:15.595 --> 21:17.494
but he has no recent
record of employment

21:17.529 --> 21:22.131
and his last tour
was five years ago.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.197
No credit card,
no social media-

21:24.232 --> 21:25.725
okay, okay.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.692
So there's him but there's
this whoa whoa dammit.

21:28.727 --> 21:30.395
Who's whoa whoa dammit?

21:30.430 --> 21:32.395
I arrested a guy in scarborough
who went by ring dammit

21:32.430 --> 21:34.065
and apparently
he got that nickname

21:34.100 --> 21:36.329
because he was always
calling at the wrong time.

21:36.364 --> 21:37.692
And there's key dammit,
also from scarborough,

21:37.727 --> 21:39.428
because he kept
forgetting his keys.

21:39.463 --> 21:40.791
Guess the guys
in scarborough

21:40.826 --> 21:42.461
really like dammit
in their handles.

21:42.496 --> 21:44.230
Both those guys had
ties to nicky clark

21:44.265 --> 21:46.263
from the victoria park area.

21:46.298 --> 21:48.164
I know nicky clark.

21:48.199 --> 21:50.428
-You know nicky clark?
-I know nicky clark.

21:50.463 --> 21:52.593
You know nicky clark?

21:52.628 --> 21:55.395
Okay, okay.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.593
There's a whoa whoa damn,
could that be him?

21:59.628 --> 22:01.692
Pow.

22:01.727 --> 22:03.263
Got him.

22:04.397 --> 22:06.164
you can always
rely on the stupidity

22:06.199 --> 22:08.131
of a young, punk-ass gangster.

22:08.166 --> 22:13.296
We got him.
We got him.

22:13.331 --> 22:14.692
Get it, nasty.

22:14.727 --> 22:17.626
Get it, nasty, get it.

22:17.661 --> 22:21.791
Get it, get it,
got to get it.

22:21.826 --> 22:24.626
-Little too close.
-Nasty, nasty sam.

22:24.661 --> 22:26.626
Nasty and good
morning to you.

22:26.661 --> 22:29.461
You look like you had
a shower and had sleep.

22:29.496 --> 22:32.395
Fed and toothbrush too.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.659
Yeah, it's what happens
when you have a life

22:34.694 --> 22:36.692
outside of work, ladies.

22:36.727 --> 22:38.791
What's the update
on the guns?

22:38.826 --> 22:42.230
Okay, we have every contact
except this callum o'malley guy.

22:42.265 --> 22:43.527
Mm.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.098
You two look like what
she pulled the sim card

22:45.133 --> 22:46.527
out of yesterday.

22:46.562 --> 22:48.593
Naz and hamm, you two
run with those warrants

22:48.628 --> 22:50.527
and etf will accompany
you on the raids, okay?

22:50.562 --> 22:52.329
Whoa. What?

22:52.364 --> 22:54.461
No, boss,
this is our intel.

22:54.496 --> 22:55.560
Yeah, we've been
up all night.

22:55.595 --> 22:57.791
Exactly.
Go home and get some sleep.

22:57.826 --> 22:59.494
Naz and hamm,
keep me posted.

23:05.562 --> 23:09.296
Yeah, we got it,
we got it. Oh, oh, we got it.

23:09.331 --> 23:11.692
Hamm and naz, we got it.

23:11.727 --> 23:13.758
Go hammer, go hammer, go.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ooh, ooh!

23:19.199 --> 23:21.296
He dyed his hair?
That's what happened?

23:21.331 --> 23:24.725
Oy. Freeze.

23:28.562 --> 23:30.164
What, you're just
going to ignore me now?

23:30.199 --> 23:32.296
You only called me
five times last night.

23:32.331 --> 23:34.692
And you ignored me
five times.

23:34.727 --> 23:36.296
What, so this is going
to be the first time

23:36.331 --> 23:38.362
you listen to your
mother, is it?

23:38.397 --> 23:40.593
I don't live with
my mother anymore.

23:45.430 --> 23:46.494
See you later, guys.

23:46.529 --> 23:48.197
Aw, dude.

23:54.826 --> 23:56.527
What are you doing?

23:56.562 --> 23:59.560
I thought it would be romantic
but you're too tall.

23:59.595 --> 24:01.593
yeah, add it to
the list of complaints.

24:01.628 --> 24:03.527
No, no. No complaints.
You're perfect.

24:03.562 --> 24:05.626
Now you're
lying again.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.164
Hey, I'm not lying.

24:07.199 --> 24:09.626
I'm done with the lying, okay?
No more lying.

24:09.661 --> 24:11.824
Truth, I like you.

24:11.859 --> 24:13.593
Truth, I miss you.

24:13.628 --> 24:16.296
Truth,

24:17.562 --> 24:19.296
my mother is a drug dealer.

24:21.463 --> 24:22.692
What?

24:22.727 --> 24:24.527
Yeah. She smuggles drugs
across the border.

24:24.562 --> 24:26.560
She told me to get to know
you so I can spy on your mom

24:26.595 --> 24:28.296
but then I couldn't
stop thinking about you.

24:28.331 --> 24:29.824
So here are the facts,
my mother is a criminal,

24:29.859 --> 24:31.230
your mother is a cop.

24:31.265 --> 24:32.494
Who's the bad guy?
I don't know.

24:32.529 --> 24:35.824
But here's what I do know,
I want to be with you.

24:38.859 --> 24:41.494
And, like, real talk...

24:41.529 --> 24:43.230
I am so high right now.

24:45.628 --> 24:47.626
I took some of my aunt's molly
and I'm starting to tweak.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.890
can you get any more?

25:07.661 --> 25:09.494
<i>♪ chase.</i>
Set 'em back then ♪

25:09.529 --> 25:11.230
<i>♪ yeah, you well on the disc ♪</i>

25:11.265 --> 25:12.431

25:16.298 --> 25:18.395
-hey.
-Hey.

25:18.430 --> 25:19.758
-You heading home?
-I don't know.

25:19.793 --> 25:21.461
I might do some paperwork.

25:21.496 --> 25:22.527
Oh, right. You're going to do
paperwork because you love it...

25:22.562 --> 25:24.527
Stop, wait.

25:24.562 --> 25:26.923
You are clearly
avoiding something.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.725
-Come on.
-No, I'm serious.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.197
I don't want you to
bottle it up, okay?

25:31.232 --> 25:33.395
You're going to get an ulcer.
Just talk to me.

25:33.430 --> 25:37.824
Okay.
Here's what's bottled in.

25:37.859 --> 25:40.890
-Okay.
-I'm annoyed.

25:40.925 --> 25:44.395
We tracked down
dozens of buyers,

25:44.430 --> 25:48.659
figuring out gang handles
and false last names.

25:48.694 --> 25:50.560
Yet the one guy we know
the most about,

25:50.595 --> 25:53.461
callum o'malley,
we can't find him.

25:53.496 --> 25:55.923
Can't even hand
him a warrant.

25:55.958 --> 25:58.494
Okay.

25:58.529 --> 26:00.659
What if we went to get
a breakfast sandwich

26:00.694 --> 26:03.923
with a side order of sliding
by his last known residence?

26:11.925 --> 26:13.362
oh.

26:15.826 --> 26:17.329
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:17.364 --> 26:18.989
Look at you.
Entre vous.

26:19.024 --> 26:20.659
My aunt here?
She's got something for me.

26:20.694 --> 26:24.659
Yeah, she's in the shower
or something.

26:24.694 --> 26:27.560
She better not be giving
this to you for free.

26:27.595 --> 26:30.593
This here stuff's
worth $50 a pop.

26:30.628 --> 26:31.824
yeah, okay.

26:31.859 --> 26:33.395
Just ignore him,
he's messing with you.

26:33.430 --> 26:35.461
No, I wouldn't
say ignore me.

26:35.496 --> 26:37.428
I can get that for
cheaper at school.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.890
Cheaper ain't necessarily
better, but go ahead,

26:38.925 --> 26:40.593
I don't care.

26:40.628 --> 26:43.857
Now you, you need to get your
mom to screw her head on right

26:43.892 --> 26:46.527
so we can start
moving this stuff by the-

26:46.562 --> 26:48.989
probably shouldn't talk about
this in front of a cop's kid.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.395
What?

26:51.430 --> 26:54.296
You brought
a cop's kid here?

26:54.331 --> 26:55.263
What are you, new?

26:55.298 --> 26:56.461
Don't.

26:56.496 --> 26:58.560
What are you doing, man?

26:58.595 --> 27:00.098
You going to run home
and tell mommy and daddy

27:00.133 --> 27:01.890
that you saw big,
bad drug dealer?

27:01.925 --> 27:04.032
Okay, he doesn't even
live with his mom.

27:04.067 --> 27:05.890
Yeah, but you look like
you borrow clothes from yours.

27:08.024 --> 27:09.527
This is la senza, punk.

27:12.859 --> 27:14.890
Oh, he's cute, jackie,
I'll give you that.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.923
Jackie here used to date
my little brother.

27:17.958 --> 27:20.593
He was a big,
badass drug dealer, right?

27:20.628 --> 27:23.329
Not so adorable
and dorky like you.

27:23.364 --> 27:24.527
Let's get out
of here, elliot.

27:24.562 --> 27:25.890
No, no.

27:25.925 --> 27:27.527
See, now I'm going to need
some assurances, right?

27:27.562 --> 27:30.296
-Randy.
-Quiet.

27:30.331 --> 27:31.999
Open up the drawer.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.659
Hurry up.

27:35.694 --> 27:38.461
Open up the drawer,
look in, pick it up.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.428
Pick it up.

27:41.463 --> 27:43.956
That's it.
Hold it in the air.

27:43.991 --> 27:46.494
Take a selfie with it.
That's good.

27:46.529 --> 27:49.395
Congratulations, man.

27:49.430 --> 27:50.989
Now your fingerprints
are all over that thing

27:51.024 --> 27:53.461
and that burner
is so dirty,

27:53.496 --> 27:55.890
you're going to be attached
to everything that it's done.

27:55.925 --> 27:58.659
try snitching now.

27:58.694 --> 28:01.098
Now we got that over with,

28:01.133 --> 28:03.923
go ahead and give him
a freebie, babe.

28:03.958 --> 28:06.560
I need water.

28:10.562 --> 28:11.494
Yeah, woo!

28:20.991 --> 28:23.362
No one lives in this dump.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.890
Shame. Just because
the land alone

28:24.925 --> 28:26.890
is probably worth like,
six figures.

28:26.925 --> 28:28.593
Oh, hey.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.065
Hey, do you live
around here?

28:32.100 --> 28:33.923
Yeah?

28:33.958 --> 28:35.758
Do you know who lives
in this house?

28:38.661 --> 28:41.032
Nobody.
They're in the ground.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.956
Did they die?

28:46.826 --> 28:50.362
Wait...

28:50.397 --> 28:54.428
Um, thank you.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.560
You should wear a helmet,
though, by the way.

28:56.595 --> 28:58.032
So, should we
have a look-see

28:58.067 --> 29:00.923
or do you have
a crosswalk to guard?

29:00.958 --> 29:02.890
Dibs on the front.

29:12.826 --> 29:14.890
Police.

29:14.925 --> 29:17.461
Anyone home?

29:20.826 --> 29:22.032
Police.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.032
Hello?

29:28.067 --> 29:30.560
Police.

29:39.925 --> 29:41.494
Hello?

29:55.694 --> 29:57.131
Hello?

29:58.760 --> 30:00.824
Hello?

30:21.628 --> 30:22.956
Ooh.

30:44.232 --> 30:45.692
Wow.

31:22.628 --> 31:25.461
Whoa. Jesus.

31:29.628 --> 31:31.923
-Wazowski.
-What?

31:31.958 --> 31:33.032
You got to come see this.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.824
Hey.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.692
Oh, no, no, no!

31:43.727 --> 31:45.593
Come on kid, open the door.

31:48.562 --> 31:50.098
We got us a problem.

31:57.826 --> 31:58.999
sam? Sam!

32:23.727 --> 32:25.857
Wazowski? Wazowski!

32:27.991 --> 32:29.098
-Are you okay?
-No, no, no, no.

32:29.133 --> 32:30.890
Don't come in,
don't come in.

32:30.925 --> 32:31.956
The room is rigged.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.032
-What?
-I stepped on something.

32:34.067 --> 32:35.263
I set off a trigger.

32:35.298 --> 32:37.692
Okay.

32:41.595 --> 32:43.065
I'm calling etf,
just stay put.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.263
Is it ringing?

32:45.298 --> 32:48.296
Must be a cell jammer in here,
I can't get a signal.

32:48.331 --> 32:49.659
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming out.

32:49.694 --> 32:50.758
Sam.

32:53.727 --> 32:55.164
Are you okay?

32:55.199 --> 32:56.329
I'm okay.

32:56.364 --> 32:58.164
Just don't move,
all right?

32:58.199 --> 32:59.263
Just let me think
for a minute, okay?

32:59.298 --> 33:02.263
I'm going to get us
out of here.

33:04.661 --> 33:05.956
Put this on, okay?

33:05.991 --> 33:07.230
You think I'm going to
get shot, is that it?

33:07.265 --> 33:09.197
You'll be fine,
just stay put.

33:09.232 --> 33:10.923
Duff, don't go!

33:13.331 --> 33:14.923
So, yeah.

33:14.958 --> 33:16.560
What do we know about
this callum again?

33:16.595 --> 33:18.230
Let's talk it through.

33:18.265 --> 33:20.065
He's a military engineer.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.065
All right, so that means
he wouldn't build something

33:22.100 --> 33:24.263
he couldn't get out of,
which means there's probably

33:24.298 --> 33:26.560
a way to turn
this funhouse off, yeah.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.329
Okay.

33:32.364 --> 33:36.890
Kid said whoever lived
here was in the ground.

33:36.925 --> 33:38.824
So maybe he was
talking about a bunker.

33:38.859 --> 33:40.164
Is that insane?

33:40.199 --> 33:42.593
Whoever lives here
is definitely insane.

33:42.628 --> 33:46.032
I think that kid was
talking about his own family.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.197
Yeah, the kid's the one
who locked us in the damn house.

33:48.232 --> 33:49.791
Who knows where
he's at now.

33:52.232 --> 33:53.824
Hey, duff.

33:53.859 --> 33:56.659
If you were ever going to
tell me what was bothering you,

33:56.694 --> 33:58.890
I could really use
a distraction right now.

34:03.067 --> 34:04.659
Like, before I die!

34:04.694 --> 34:06.593
You're not going
to die, all right?

34:06.628 --> 34:08.131
Why won't you tell me?

34:08.166 --> 34:09.758
I think you're being ridiculous!

34:09.793 --> 34:13.131
It's keegan, all right?

34:19.166 --> 34:22.263
He beat up that kid,
unprovoked.

34:23.859 --> 34:25.560
I saw it on
the surveillance footage.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.032
Are you going to tell siu?

34:36.133 --> 34:39.857
Hopefully I won't have to.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.890
-Hey, are you on the floor?
-Yeah, why?

34:47.166 --> 34:50.956
-Jesus.
-I think I found the triggers.

34:50.991 --> 34:52.857
-Oh, really?
-Get under the vest, okay?

34:52.892 --> 34:55.428
Okay.

34:55.463 --> 34:57.065
All right, I'm going to
count down from three.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.890
-You ready?
-Yes.

34:58.925 --> 35:01.857
Three, two...

35:17.199 --> 35:19.692
Sam? Are you okay?

35:22.892 --> 35:24.032
I'm okay.

35:26.826 --> 35:28.395
-Okay.
-I'm okay.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.989
Okay. So just get up
slowly, all right?

35:31.024 --> 35:32.923
Watch your step.

35:32.958 --> 35:34.395
Take your time.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.329
Take your time.
Take your time.

35:36.364 --> 35:37.890
Okay.

35:37.925 --> 35:40.923
-Okay, you're good.
-Thank you.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.725
Yeah, that's what
friends are for, right?

35:42.760 --> 35:44.956
Did you mean that?

35:44.991 --> 35:46.065
Well, it's just
a saying really.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.230
I think you meant it.

35:47.265 --> 35:48.824
-Let's table that.
-Nope.

35:48.859 --> 35:50.230
Let's go,
let's get out of here.

35:50.265 --> 35:52.725
You ever pick
six locks before?

35:52.760 --> 35:53.758
Trying...

35:55.826 --> 35:58.857
barnies.

35:58.892 --> 36:00.428
guns on the floor.

36:01.991 --> 36:03.692
Please and thank you.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.032
Barnies in my house...

36:16.067 --> 36:18.065
Callum, I think there's
been a terrible mistake.

36:18.100 --> 36:22.329
a big mistake.
I was born a mistake.

36:22.364 --> 36:25.065
School...
Mistake after mistake.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.197
College.

36:27.232 --> 36:31.362
And then another huge mistake
was joining the military.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.032
Killed five innocent
people over there.

36:35.067 --> 36:39.362
My superiors decided to deem
that a mistake as well.

36:48.397 --> 36:52.362
see, I do believe there's a time
and a place for violence,

36:52.397 --> 36:55.824
like when I find two
barnies in my house

36:55.859 --> 36:59.857
without papers
to justify their trespassing.

36:59.892 --> 37:04.263
I think that this is exactly
that time and place...

37:12.859 --> 37:15.824
This little piggy's
been mucking with my toys.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.923
No matter, there's more
where that came from.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.857
I got something for you,
you just wait.

37:24.298 --> 37:25.461
Duff, I don't have
the training for this.

37:25.496 --> 37:26.824
I didn't take that course.

37:26.859 --> 37:28.065
You know, there's
courses on hostage...

37:28.100 --> 37:29.362
I didn't take it.
Did you take it?

37:29.397 --> 37:31.230
-Because I didn't take it.
-Shh. Quiet.

37:31.265 --> 37:32.461
Listen, right now you
need to distract him

37:32.496 --> 37:34.461
with a good old
negotiation, okay?

37:34.496 --> 37:36.890
Hot lava.

37:38.024 --> 37:39.428
woo!

37:39.463 --> 37:42.032
Just remember what I taught you
and lean in to the truth.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.032
You can do this.

37:47.067 --> 37:48.197
Hey, callum.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.065
Hey, callum,
can I talk to...?

37:51.100 --> 37:52.263
Yeah, hi.

37:52.298 --> 37:54.131
I just, I know the game,
hot lava.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.791
I used to play it
when I was a kid.

37:55.826 --> 37:58.131
Like the floor is lava
and then the couch is safe,

37:58.166 --> 37:59.791
so stay off the floor
and you'll be fine

37:59.826 --> 38:01.230
but it's "barnies"
that I don't...

38:01.265 --> 38:02.791
I don't know
what that means.

38:02.826 --> 38:04.923
What, you never
watch television?

38:04.958 --> 38:07.494
No, it's just all jigsaws
and solitaire for me.

38:10.024 --> 38:14.131
Barney miller,
classy cops, classy pigs.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.428
You two are certainly
no exception.

38:16.463 --> 38:17.494
Pigs are cute.
They're pretty smart, too.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.824
You might like a pig.

38:18.859 --> 38:21.527
Pigs are ham, pork, bacon.

38:21.562 --> 38:23.362
Well, if I was bacon
I think I would be

38:23.397 --> 38:25.428
emotionally intuitive
bacon and...

38:25.463 --> 38:29.791
Callum, I just don't think
you're always this way.

38:29.826 --> 38:31.956
I don't know.

38:31.991 --> 38:34.494
Two tours in afghanistan, giving
your life to an institution-

38:34.529 --> 38:36.329
you think you know me?

38:36.364 --> 38:38.329
You don't know me.

38:38.364 --> 38:41.296
What does your son
think about this?

38:44.199 --> 38:47.560
My son will grow up
without your confines

38:47.595 --> 38:49.494
and constrictions.

38:51.628 --> 38:54.197
I have a son

38:54.232 --> 38:56.923
and I tried to
bring him up

38:56.958 --> 38:59.923
with my work ethic
and my morals.

38:59.958 --> 39:01.494
But guess what?

39:01.529 --> 39:04.329
He pushed me away.
He pushed me away.

39:04.364 --> 39:06.329
No, he doesn't want
to be anything like me.

39:06.364 --> 39:09.428
I would not blame him.

39:09.463 --> 39:12.923
You shut your mouth
about my son, all right?

39:12.958 --> 39:15.197
Because if you don't,
I will gut you,

39:15.232 --> 39:16.560
put you on a spit,

39:16.595 --> 39:19.230
and roast you up
like the little piggy you are.

39:19.265 --> 39:20.593
Ahh!

39:47.364 --> 39:49.626
-nice job, wazowski.
-You too, duff.

39:49.661 --> 39:52.197
Thought I was going
to die in there.

39:52.232 --> 39:55.560
-Oh yeah. 100%.
-What?

39:55.595 --> 39:56.989
Of course, not.
I had it.

39:57.024 --> 39:59.362
We- we had it.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.593
We definitely had it.

40:00.628 --> 40:04.065
we had it, we had it.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.560
Oh, look at you.

40:05.595 --> 40:08.230
we had it, we had it.

40:08.265 --> 40:10.065
I can't believe this bust.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.131
We're going to be hauling guns
out of this dump for days.

40:15.364 --> 40:18.956
speaking of, I should probably
go and just make sure

40:18.991 --> 40:20.999
that they've counted
all the bullets.

40:26.562 --> 40:27.989
Okay, what was that about?

40:28.024 --> 40:29.626
I don't know.

40:31.463 --> 40:34.989
Have you heard
anything from keegan?

40:35.024 --> 40:37.395
No, why?

40:39.727 --> 40:40.956
You might want to
take a look at this.

40:44.463 --> 40:47.131
Night.

40:51.661 --> 40:55.923
This is the purest stuff
I ever had in my life.

40:55.958 --> 40:58.197
Are you feeling it?

40:58.232 --> 40:59.626
Yeah, I am.

41:05.024 --> 41:07.032
Yo, play more music.

41:07.067 --> 41:09.131
I want to dance.

41:13.463 --> 41:15.131
This one.

41:15.166 --> 41:18.230

You gave me a key.
