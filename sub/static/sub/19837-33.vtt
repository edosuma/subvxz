<b>that you kept your word.</b>

02:43.100 --> 02:45.210
<b>It's thanks to your promise thread.</b>

02:45.650 --> 02:48.850
<b>A few times, I almost gave in.</b>

02:48.850 --> 02:51.060
<b>But when I looked at the thread,</b>

02:51.060 --> 02:53.610
<b>I was able to control myself.</b>

02:53.610 --> 02:56.280
<b>That's because I added some <i>Nen</i> to help you.</b>

02:56.280 --> 02:57.740
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

02:57.740 --> 02:59.990
<b>No, I was lying.</b>

03:00.310 --> 03:01.490
<b>Huh?</b>

03:01.490 --> 03:05.330
<b>But how could you tell that he kept his word?</b>

03:05.330 --> 03:08.790
<b>He could have been practicing in secret.</b>

03:10.430 --> 03:13.500
<b>Because the promise thread remained intact.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Zushi, what do you think?</b>

03:41.620 --> 03:43.620
<b>I-It's amazing!</b>

<b>His aura is flowing all around him!</b>

03:47.220 --> 03:48.840
<b>Soft and calm...</b>

03:48.840 --> 03:51.720
<b>But it's very strong!</b>

03:52.700 --> 03:53.980
<b>I did it!</b>

03:53.980 --> 03:55.210
<b>Whew...</b>

03:55.210 --> 03:58.050
<b>I was worried that I might

<b>Once you've learned the technique,

04:01.080 --> 04:03.930
<b>However, to become a master,</b>

04:03.930 --> 04:06.300
<b>you'll have to train hard.</b>

04:06.300 --> 04:09.900
<b>But it felt easier than before,</b>

04:09.900 --> 04:12.690
<b>despite not having been practicing <i>Ten</i>.</b>

04:12.690 --> 04:14.310
<b>That's because</b>

04:14.310 --> 04:17.390
<b>you were training your spirit each day.</b>

04:17.390 --> 04:19.690
<b>Now, look at your left hand.</b>

04:19.690 --> 04:20.480
<b>Huh?</b>

04:22.330 --> 04:23.550
<b>It snapped!</b>

04:25.080 --> 04:27.800
<b>By applying my own <i>Nen</i>, 
I tied the thread such that</b>

04:27.800 --> 04:29.930
<b>if you broke your promise and used <i>Nen</i>,</b>

04:30.750 --> 04:32.450
<b>it would snap.</b>

04:32.840 --> 04:34.750
<b><i>That's actually possible?</i></b>

04:35.550 --> 04:37.030
<b>Hey, Wing-san...</b>

04:37.030 --> 04:38.960
<b>Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?</b>

04:39.330 --> 04:40.840
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

04:40.840 --> 04:42.900
<b>What was the ability that Hisoka used?</b>

04:42.900 --> 04:46.460
<b>Could we send loose limbs flying around?</b>

04:46.460 --> 04:48.930
<b>Hmm, that's a difficult question.</b>

04:49.810 --> 04:52.470
<b>Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?</b>

04:52.800 --> 04:54.690
<b>No, not yet.</b>

04:56.450 --> 04:59.230
<b>Then I'll explain while we watch.</b>

05:07.100 --> 05:11.910
<b>Can you see the threads of aura 
extending from his left hand?</b>

05:11.910 --> 05:13.370
<b>Threads of aura?</b>

05:13.370 --> 05:14.520
<b>Yes.</b>

05:15.300 --> 05:16.870
<b>Do you see them?</b>

05:18.520 --> 05:20.170
<b>N-Nope.</b>

05:20.170 --> 05:22.050
<b>I can't see a thing.</b>

05:22.050 --> 05:23.380
<b>Same here.</b>

05:26.940 --> 05:29.840
<b>Are there really threads of aura</b>

05:29.840 --> 05:31.640
<b>coming from Hisoka's left hand?</b>

05:31.640 --> 05:34.450
<b>Yes, Hisoka is using a technique</b>

05:34.450 --> 05:37.900
<b>that makes his aura difficult to perceive.</b>

05:37.980 --> 05:40.980
<b>Null</b>

05:38.300 --> 05:42.400
<b>It's a high-level application of <i>Zetsu</i>, known as <i>In</i>.</b>

05:40.980 --> 05:42.400
<b>Hide</b>

05:42.820 --> 05:44.000
<b>When you use <i>In</i>,</b>

05:44.000 --> 05:46.900
<b>even the strongest opponents will 
find it hard to see your aura.</b>

05:47.310 --> 05:48.900
<b>The most effective counter to this technique</b>

05:47.990 --> 05:51.950
<b>Enhance</b>

05:48.900 --> 05:50.370
<b>is to focus the aura created by <i>Ren</i></b>

05:50.370 --> 05:54.790
<b>into your eyes, a technique called <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

05:51.950 --> 05:54.790
<b>Focus</b>

05:55.320 --> 05:58.440
<b>The method Gon-kun used 
in his fight with Gido</b>

05:58.440 --> 06:00.230
<b>might work, as well.</b>

06:00.790 --> 06:03.270
<b>However, you couldn't take offensive action,</b>

06:03.270 --> 06:05.380
<b>so ultimately, you'd throw your life away.</b>

06:07.170 --> 06:08.680
<b>Right.</b>

06:08.680 --> 06:10.940
<b>My assignment for you two</b>

06:10.940 --> 06:14.440
<b>is to practice <i>Ren</i> until you 
can see through Hisoka's <i>In</i>.</b>

06:14.440 --> 06:15.250
<b>Eh?</b>

06:15.250 --> 06:17.250
<b>Uh, master?</b>

06:17.250 --> 06:19.140
<b>What should I do?</b>

06:20.180 --> 06:21.240
<b>Zushi,</b>

06:21.240 --> 06:25.150
<b>you should already be strong 
enough to see past his <i>In</i>.</b>

06:25.540 --> 06:26.730
<b>I should?</b>

06:27.330 --> 06:30.110
<b>Show them your <i>Ren</i>.</b>

06:33.350 --> 06:34.770
<b>O-Osu!</b>

06:44.100 --> 06:45.010
<b><i>Ren!</i></b>

06:46.960 --> 06:49.230
<b><i>It's so strong.</i></b>

06:49.230 --> 06:51.730
<b><i>It doesn't have a much greater magnitude,</i></b>

06:51.730 --> 06:53.930
<b><i>but it's very dense.</i></b>

06:54.420 --> 06:56.950
<b>Then direct that aura into your eyes.</b>

06:56.950 --> 06:57.930
<b>Osu!</b>

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
<b><i>Gyo!</i></b>

07:09.120 --> 07:12.200
<b>So, can you see the aura that emanates</b>

07:12.200 --> 07:13.700
<b>from Hisoka's body?</b>

07:19.150 --> 07:20.460
<b>Yes.</b>

07:20.830 --> 07:24.470
<b>And how many threads are there?</b>

07:25.320 --> 07:26.960
<b>Twelve...</b>

07:26.960 --> 07:29.720
<b>No, I think it's thirteen.</b>

07:30.190 --> 07:31.500
<b>Not quite.</b>

07:31.500 --> 07:33.470
<b>But you were close.</b>

07:36.350 --> 07:38.010
<b>I could really see them!</b>

07:38.010 --> 07:40.670
<b>You're making excellent progress, Zushi.</b>

07:40.670 --> 07:42.040
<b>O-Osu...</b>

07:42.040 --> 07:43.600
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

07:43.600 --> 07:46.970
<b>By channeling all your power through <i>Gyo</i>,</b>

07:46.970 --> 07:50.110
<b>you achieved a level where you 
could see through Hisoka's <i>In</i>.</b>

07:50.550 --> 07:52.130
<b>But with enough training,</b>

07:52.130 --> 07:55.380
<b>you'll be able to use <i>Gyo</i> while fighting.</b>

07:56.980 --> 07:58.610
<b>Do you understand?</b>

07:58.610 --> 08:00.480
<b>First, practice <i>Ren</i>,</b>

08:00.480 --> 08:02.830
<b>and master the <i>Ren</i> application known as <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

08:03.280 --> 08:06.580
<b>Then you'll discover the true nature</b>

08:06.580 --> 08:08.840
<b>of Hisoka's ability.</b>

08:09.270 --> 08:13.030
<b>And will you be able to use that same ability?</b>

08:13.030 --> 08:16.220
<b>My answer is both yes and no.</b>

08:17.440 --> 08:19.470
<b>Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,</b>

08:19.470 --> 08:23.480
<b>so long as it uses <i>Nen</i>, you can learn it.</b>

08:23.480 --> 08:24.450
<b>However,</b>

08:24.450 --> 08:28.220
<b><i>Nen</i> powers depend on the 
particular individual.</b>

08:28.220 --> 08:31.800
<b>Each of us possesses different 
specialties and preferences.</b>

08:32.580 --> 08:34.860
<b>Thus, <i>Nen</i> differs for each person.</b>

08:35.750 --> 08:37.940
<b>If you're serious about mastering <i>Nen</i>,</b>

08:37.940 --> 08:40.880
<b>you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.</b>

08:40.880 --> 08:44.000
<b>It's important that you first identify 
your own strengths.</b>

08:44.780 --> 08:46.300
<b><i>Strengths...</i></b>

08:47.100 --> 08:49.610
<b>You've only just begun to develop.</b>

08:49.610 --> 08:51.510
<b>You haven't settled on one form yet.</b>

08:52.060 --> 08:55.560
<b>Initially, try to grow as much as you can.</b>

08:55.560 --> 08:57.640
<b>That is the purpose of this training.</b>

08:58.120 --> 09:00.010
<b>Train hard,</b>

09:00.010 --> 09:03.180
<b>play hard, and enjoy life.</b>

09:03.180 --> 09:04.370
<b>Osu!</b>

09:05.660 --> 09:10.870
<b>The final day of Killua-kun's 
window to fight is June 9th,</b>

09:10.870 --> 09:12.650
<b>and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?</b>

09:13.210 --> 09:16.910
<b>I'd like you both to register for your final day.</b>

09:17.550 --> 09:19.530
<b>In the meantime, you'll train.</b>

09:20.000 --> 09:22.540
<b>You must learn <i>Gyo</i> 
before it's time for your battle.</b>

09:23.020 --> 09:24.050
<b>Osu!</b>

09:25.980 --> 09:28.890
<b>Your <i>Ren</i> was impressive, Zushi.</b>

09:28.890 --> 09:32.550
<b>You moved way ahead while I was resting.</b>

09:33.010 --> 09:36.280
<b>No, I still have a long path before me.</b>

09:36.280 --> 09:39.680
<b>Hey, let's practice what we just learned.</b>

09:40.060 --> 09:43.120
<b>Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon.</b>

09:43.120 --> 09:43.930
<b>Okay.</b>

09:52.740 --> 09:54.440
<b>Killua... Zushi.</b>

09:54.860 --> 09:55.690
<b>Osu!</b>

09:56.250 --> 09:57.950
<b>We have company.</b>

10:09.210 --> 10:11.390
<b>You guys don't know when to quit.</b>

10:11.390 --> 10:13.590
<b>That's why no one likes you.</b>

10:13.890 --> 10:15.910
<b>Oh, don't be so harsh.</b>

10:15.910 --> 10:18.250
<b>Tell me when you're going to fight,</b>

10:18.250 --> 10:21.350
<b>because I'd love to be your opponent.</b>

10:23.160 --> 10:26.110
<b>I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.</b>

10:26.110 --> 10:29.470
<b>They want to rack up wins 
by beating us up.</b>

10:29.980 --> 10:32.190
<b>We're getting desperate...</b>

10:32.500 --> 10:34.580
<b>Because our deadline is nearing.</b>

10:34.920 --> 10:37.110
<b>Come on, let's fight.</b>

10:37.520 --> 10:41.520
<b>I'll even demonstrate my power</b>

10:42.330 --> 10:43.720
<b>right now.</b>

10:46.840 --> 10:49.910
<b>I'm fighting on June 10th.</b>

10:49.910 --> 10:51.130
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

10:52.050 --> 10:54.060
<b>That won't work.</b>

10:54.060 --> 10:57.630
<b>My deadline is May 29th.</b>

10:57.630 --> 10:59.640
<b>Fight on that day.</b>

10:59.640 --> 11:02.390
<b>Who cares about your deadline, moron?</b>

11:02.390 --> 11:03.500
<b>Let's go.</b>

11:05.890 --> 11:07.640
<b>Gon-chan...</b>

11:07.640 --> 11:11.280
<b>You and I will fight.</b>

11:13.380 --> 11:15.900
<b>I guarantee it.</b>

11:16.490 --> 11:18.440
<b>Gon, ignore him.</b>

11:20.060 --> 11:21.920
<b>What will you do?</b>

11:21.920 --> 11:23.690
<b>I'll force him to fight me.</b>

11:33.450 --> 11:36.500
<b>Visualize the energy building in your body.</b>

11:36.860 --> 11:42.720
<b>Power gathers in each cell, and grows.</b>

11:43.680 --> 11:45.760
<b>Then you force that power</b>

11:45.760 --> 11:46.510
<b>out!</b>

11:53.730 --> 11:55.550
<b>I'm getting used to this.</b>

11:55.550 --> 11:58.030
<b>Learning when to shroud the 
boosted aura with <i>Ten</i></b>

11:58.030 --> 11:59.550
<b>was a little tricky.</b>

11:59.550 --> 12:01.030
<b><i>A-A little?</i></b>

12:01.870 --> 12:04.280
<b><i>They pick it up too fast!</i></b>

12:04.620 --> 12:09.290
<b>But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.</b>

12:09.290 --> 12:10.820
<b>Guess we should practice more.</b>

12:11.580 --> 12:14.250
<b>N-No, that's enough!</b>

12:14.250 --> 12:16.450
<b>Learning when to rest is part of training.</b>

12:16.450 --> 12:18.560
<b>Let's call it a day.</b>

12:18.560 --> 12:19.920
<b>Really? I can still—</b>

12:20.230 --> 12:21.420
<b>No!</b>

12:22.060 --> 12:25.650
<b><i>If they pass me in half a day,

12:26.760 --> 12:28.120
<b>Oh...</b>

12:28.120 --> 12:29.330
<b>Well, it's okay.</b>

12:29.330 --> 12:30.810
<b>We'll practice more tomorrow.</b>

12:31.700 --> 12:32.430
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:34.430 --> 12:36.390
<b>See you tomorrow.</b>

12:36.390 --> 12:37.490
<b>Bye.</b>

12:43.320 --> 12:44.700
<b>Okay, then...</b>

13:16.810 --> 13:17.980
<b><i>I can't...</i></b>

13:18.560 --> 13:20.980
<b><i>I can't move!</i></b>

13:21.570 --> 13:23.880
<b><i>I can't talk or breathe...</i></b>

13:24.290 --> 13:26.000
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

13:31.350 --> 13:32.240
<b>Oops.</b>

13:38.550 --> 13:40.040
<b>Please...</b>

13:48.380 --> 13:49.930
<b>Forget it.</b>

13:52.500 --> 13:54.830
<b>I figured you were up to something.</b>

13:55.260 --> 13:58.900
<b>But you don't need dirty tricks 
to make me fight you.</b>

13:59.260 --> 14:00.920
<b>When do you want to fight?</b>

14:02.360 --> 14:03.680
<b>Don't worry.</b>

14:03.680 --> 14:05.550
<b>I'll let you win.</b>

14:05.550 --> 14:09.030
<b>I'll even give you each a win.</b>

14:09.680 --> 14:11.280
<b>Is that good enough?</b>

14:13.670 --> 14:16.240
<b>After I get my win off you,</b>

14:16.240 --> 14:18.790
<b>I'm going to fight Gon-chan.</b>

14:18.790 --> 14:20.640
<b>If you want to fight Gon,</b>

14:20.640 --> 14:22.960
<b>you'll have to follow his schedule.</b>

14:22.960 --> 14:25.790
<b>He'll be more than happy to fight you.</b>

14:27.230 --> 14:28.760
<b>I can promise you that.</b>

14:31.460 --> 14:32.630
<b>Okay.</b>

14:32.630 --> 14:35.080
<b>If you two are willing to fight,</b>

14:35.080 --> 14:38.400
<b>we don't need to bother with this.</b>

14:39.030 --> 14:41.560
<b>Let's go register together.</b>

14:42.300 --> 14:45.570
<b>Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed.</b>

14:45.890 --> 14:48.240
<b>Yeah, yeah. Sure...</b>

14:48.240 --> 14:51.270
<b>But only this once.</b>

14:54.680 --> 14:56.950
<b>May 29th...</b>

14:57.650 --> 14:59.830
<b>Okay, happy now?</b>

14:59.830 --> 15:00.960
<b>Yes,</b>

15:00.960 --> 15:03.020
<b>we'll return him.</b>

15:10.160 --> 15:13.670
<b>Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal.</b>

15:13.670 --> 15:15.640
<b>If you break your promise...</b>

15:16.540 --> 15:19.050
<b>Eh... Whatever.</b>

15:19.050 --> 15:20.370
<b>Forget it.</b>

15:20.370 --> 15:22.540
<b>What? You got me curious.</b>

15:22.540 --> 15:24.900
<b>What will happen if we break our promise?</b>

15:25.460 --> 15:27.470
<b>No point in telling you now.</b>

15:27.470 --> 15:30.150
<b>Just keep your word.</b>

15:36.980 --> 15:39.660
<b>Hello? Is this Gon-kun?</b>

15:43.650 --> 15:47.300
<b>I'm sure you'll understand what this means.</b>

15:48.360 --> 15:53.090
<b>As long as you don't tell anyone, 
and you follow my instructions,</b>

15:54.170 --> 15:58.350
<b>the three of you will be able to 
train as usual tomorrow.</b>

16:00.530 --> 16:01.990
<b><i>Zushi...</i></b>

16:08.870 --> 16:10.740
<b>How did it go with Gon-chan?</b>

16:10.740 --> 16:12.050
<b>Perfect.</b>

16:12.050 --> 16:14.290
<b>He's registered for the 30th.</b>

16:15.180 --> 16:16.920
<b>That's two wins.</b>

16:16.920 --> 16:18.370
<b>Too easy.</b>

16:25.200 --> 16:28.880
<b><i>Not killing people is pretty hard.</i></b>

16:30.800 --> 16:32.530
<b>Clean living's tough...</b>

16:40.590 --> 16:43.770
<b>Come on down! We have tickets!</b>

16:44.260 --> 16:46.770
<b>These are fresh off the press...</b>

16:46.770 --> 16:49.380
<b>Gon versus Sadaso!</b>

16:49.380 --> 16:52.030
<b>And here's Killua versus Sadaso...</b>

16:52.670 --> 16:56.050
<b>If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!</b>

16:56.050 --> 16:57.040
<b>Pops.</b>

16:57.040 --> 16:57.910
<b>Yep?</b>

16:58.270 --> 17:01.190
<b>Does Sadaso have only one arm?</b>

17:01.190 --> 17:05.170
<b>Yeah, the one-armed fighter, 
with the mask-like face.</b>

17:05.480 --> 17:09.000
<b>If he catches you with his 
invisible left arm, you're finished.</b>

17:09.000 --> 17:11.920
<b>They call him the newbie crusher...</b>

17:13.940 --> 17:15.380
<b>That bastard.</b>

17:18.980 --> 17:20.430
<b>Huh? Killua?</b>

17:20.940 --> 17:23.310
<b>Gon, you were here?</b>

17:23.800 --> 17:25.690
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

17:25.690 --> 17:26.740
<b>Killua-kun,</b>

17:26.740 --> 17:29.210
<b>I believe you helped Zushi last night.</b>

17:29.210 --> 17:30.190
<b>Thank you.</b>

17:30.630 --> 17:32.140
<b>You feeling all right?</b>

17:32.140 --> 17:33.920
<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

17:33.920 --> 17:36.190
<b>I was probably tired.</b>

17:36.190 --> 17:38.210
<b>Sorry to worry you!</b>

17:38.210 --> 17:40.520
<b>Oh, Wing-san...</b>

17:40.520 --> 17:42.450
<b>Can we watch that video again?</b>

17:43.090 --> 17:46.210
<b>I've learned how to use <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

17:48.840 --> 17:50.210
<b><i>Really?</i></b>

18:04.350 --> 18:06.140
<b>Fifteen threads, right?</b>

18:06.140 --> 18:09.500
<b>Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf,</b>

18:09.500 --> 18:13.600
<b>and a well hidden one that 
leads to the arm he tossed.</b>

18:14.260 --> 18:15.490
<b>Continue.</b>

18:16.860 --> 18:18.220
<b>Hisoka is...</b>

18:18.710 --> 18:20.610
<b>Hisoka's aura appears</b>

18:20.610 --> 18:22.990
<b>to expand and contract.</b>

18:23.660 --> 18:24.870
<b>Or does it</b>

18:24.870 --> 18:27.760
<b>attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?</b>

18:27.760 --> 18:30.080
<b>Why else would his arm reattach?</b>

18:30.870 --> 18:34.250
<b>Or fly into his opponent's chin?</b>

18:35.340 --> 18:37.930
<b>It's probably the former.</b>

18:38.410 --> 18:41.640
<b>His aura is elastic, like rubber.</b>

18:42.360 --> 18:46.390
<b>That would explain most of his tricks.</b>

18:49.180 --> 18:51.900
<b><i>He's on a completely different level!</i></b>

18:52.390 --> 18:54.600
<b>Very good... You pass.</b>

18:55.140 --> 18:57.490
<b>But I am surprised...</b>

18:57.490 --> 19:01.130
<b>I didn't expect you both to learn <i>Gyo</i> overnight.</b>

19:02.180 --> 19:03.260
<b>Gon?</b>

19:03.930 --> 19:04.830
<b>Uh-huh,</b>

19:04.830 --> 19:08.260
<b>but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power.</b>

19:08.260 --> 19:09.620
<b>So, Killua-kun,</b>

19:10.440 --> 19:15.010
<b>since you finished your assignment, 
I assume you want to fight, yes?</b>

19:16.100 --> 19:19.190
<b>O-Oh, I wasn't trying to 
beat you to the punch.</b>

19:19.190 --> 19:22.180
<b>I just got an itch to fight.</b>

19:23.090 --> 19:25.310
<b>Yeah, I get it.</b>

19:25.700 --> 19:28.560
<b><i>Gon, they must have threatened you.</i></b>

19:29.220 --> 19:32.440
<b>Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight.</b>

19:32.870 --> 19:34.610
<b>May 29th.</b>

19:34.610 --> 19:36.590
<b>Mine's May 30th.</b>

19:37.170 --> 19:38.710
<b>That's fine.</b>

19:38.710 --> 19:42.410
<b>I underestimated how fast you could learn.</b>

19:42.410 --> 19:46.370
<b>Spend the remaining days practicing <i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>.</b>

19:47.470 --> 19:51.420
<b>Be sure you get plenty 
of practice, rest, and sleep.</b>

19:51.810 --> 19:52.860
<b>Osu!</b>

19:54.900 --> 19:55.940
<b>Killua...</b>

19:56.830 --> 19:59.760
<b>They must have threatened you.</b>

20:00.240 --> 20:01.660
<b>Now I'm mad...</b>

20:02.600 --> 20:06.150
<b>Yeah, but my biggest concern</b>

20:06.150 --> 20:07.720
<b>was the master, and he agreed.</b>

20:08.160 --> 20:12.860
<b>But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.</b>

20:13.770 --> 20:15.110
<b>It'll be okay.</b>

20:16.590 --> 20:18.490
<b>You don't need to worry.</b>

20:22.560 --> 20:26.050
<b>Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.</b>

20:26.050 --> 20:28.870
<b>Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan 
for my seventh win.</b>

20:29.690 --> 20:33.870
<b>Then I just need to find three more chumps.</b>

20:35.960 --> 20:37.530
<b>And I'll be a Floor Master.</b>

20:38.210 --> 20:42.510
<b>I'll get all the wealth and glory to 
set me up for the rest of my life.</b>

20:46.980 --> 20:49.060
<b>Move, and I will kill you...</b>

20:49.600 --> 20:51.740
<b>Use <i>Nen</i>, and I will kill you.</b>

20:51.740 --> 20:53.760
<b>Make a sound, and I will kill you.</b>

20:54.290 --> 20:56.620
<b>If you understand, slowly close your eyes.</b>

20:58.390 --> 21:01.820
<b>Do you know what happens 
if you break your word?</b>

21:03.020 --> 21:06.020
<b>If you know, slowly open your eyes.</b>

21:06.020 --> 21:08.560
<b>Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.</b>

21:12.650 --> 21:15.990
<b>Never show your filthy face to us again.</b>

21:17.080 --> 21:18.430
<b>That's a promise.</b>

21:23.890 --> 21:25.930
<b>Time has run out for Sadaso!</b>

21:25.930 --> 21:27.390
<b>Killua wins by default!</b>

21:27.690 --> 21:30.970
<b>Damn, I want my money back!</b>

21:31.940 --> 21:34.400
<b>Killua opens the battle 
against the persistent trio</b>

21:34.400 --> 21:37.150
<b>with a win by default.</b>

21:37.150 --> 21:39.220
<b>Thanks to their inborn talent,</b>

21:39.220 --> 21:43.140
<b>Gon and Killua are learning <i>Nen</i> 
at incredible speeds.</b>

21:43.140 --> 21:46.350
<b>Now they will start the real battle</b>

21:46.350 --> 21:48.580
<b>at Heavens Arena.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.490
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.740 --> 23:19.330
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.700
<b>Today, we introduce Sadaso.</b>

23:11.070 --> 23:13.580
<b>A Heavens Arena 
200s-class warrior.</b>

23:11.700 --> 23:13.080
<b>He underwent the traditional greeting</b>

23:13.080 --> 23:15.050
<b>with Gido and Riehlvelt.</b>

23:13.580 --> 23:19.620
<b>Alters his <i>Nen</i> to form 
an invisible left arm.</b>

23:15.050 --> 23:15.740
<b>Yeah?</b>

23:15.740 --> 23:18.070
<b>His invisible left arm is made of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:18.070 --> 23:18.780
<b>Yeah?</b>

23:18.780 --> 23:19.270
<b>Oh.</b>

23:19.270 --> 23:19.870
<b>Yeah?</b>

23:24.960 --> 23:27.720
<b>Next time: Power x To x Avenge!</b>

23:27.720 --> 23:29.910
<b>Power, yeah?</b>

23:29.910 --> 23:31.840
<b>Avenge, yeah?</b>

23:31.840 --> 23:34.770
<b>Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?</b>
