WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.894
200 bucks missing from my wallet.

00:02.128 --> 00:03.568
- Owen?
- No elves.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.215
I saw him about an
hour ago. He was flying.

00:05.462 --> 00:06.883
- On what?
- Meth.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.134
I'm... I'm sick, man...

00:09.253 --> 00:11.823
- I want to get better.
- Okay, so here's what's going down.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.849
You're going to enroll in a program
that's going to get you off the drugs.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.816
You're going to get a job
and you're going to live your life like...

00:19.061 --> 00:21.124
You know, a relatively normal human being.

00:21.395 --> 00:23.773
The increase in suicides
started in New Orleans,

00:24.021 --> 00:26.426
then spread up through here,
and as high as Arkansas.

00:26.655 --> 00:28.910
- Suicides don't spread.
- The results are the same

00:29.084 --> 00:30.665
across all demographics.
Even kids.

00:33.115 --> 00:34.431
I found a phorbol.

00:35.946 --> 00:38.141
I found it in all the samples
of the suicide victims.

00:38.226 --> 00:40.072
Brains and all the other organs.

00:40.337 --> 00:42.320
Fuck! P.K.C.

00:42.435 --> 00:45.353
- Phorbols don't occur naturally in humans.
- So where did they come from?

00:45.477 --> 00:47.461
We have no idea.
And there's something else.

00:48.037 --> 00:50.142
This is a new one.
It's never been seen before.

00:50.416 --> 00:54.931
This chick called last night,
said, uh... Harlan died.

00:55.018 --> 00:57.181
They had a lawyer
from the company

00:57.268 --> 01:00.862
come over here last night asking for...

01:01.186 --> 01:03.522
Harlan's laptop and all of his files.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.951
I think Harlan left us something.

01:06.388 --> 01:09.590
Actually I think these genes have
something to do with sexual reproduction.

01:09.825 --> 01:13.281
Well, according to these labels,
they're all boys.

01:13.747 --> 01:17.040
So does the world really
need a cure for homosexuality?

01:17.388 --> 01:18.701
Is it a disease?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.871
Lowy have filed an
injunction that we, NorBAC,

01:20.957 --> 01:23.071
are not releasing research
that belongs to them.

01:26.696 --> 01:27.881
Where is it?

01:28.595 --> 01:30.651
No one has any idea
what happened to it.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.223
Thank you, sir.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

01:42.776 --> 01:45.441
David and Carlos left
for Arkansas this morning.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.192
Yes, they're on the suicides.

01:49.507 --> 01:50.453
What?

01:50.685 --> 01:52.311
Where are you hearing this?

01:52.986 --> 01:55.903
No! If somebody is telling you
I'm not responding to a court order,

01:55.957 --> 01:57.643
I want you to know that's bullshit.

01:58.495 --> 02:00.441
Yes, the research is still missing.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.192
Come up here for what? I'll have
something for you by the end of the week.

02:05.205 --> 02:07.591
Yeah, you have a great day too.

02:09.556 --> 02:10.493
Wes!

02:11.657 --> 02:13.921
I don't want excuses.
I don't want theories.

02:14.027 --> 02:16.073
I want to know what
happened to that research.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.073
I think we should sit
down and talk to David.

02:19.387 --> 02:21.023
I think that Connor
McGuinn would like that.

02:22.878 --> 02:25.432
I just wanted to
let you know that Carlos

02:25.525 --> 02:27.872
- and David made it to Arkansas.
- Thank you, Mayko.

02:28.955 --> 02:29.910
Wes.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.570
You need to find
Harlan Sendack's research--

02:39.617 --> 02:42.083
I could find it, if you were here.
But I think your senior scientist--

02:42.126 --> 02:45.081
Because that's your job.
And McGuinn is my job.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.533
- You got that?
- Yes!

04:20.656 --> 04:23.863
2.10 - The Wild & Innocent

04:25.998 --> 04:27.720
The State beverage is milk,

04:27.958 --> 04:29.720
the State bird is the mockingbird,

04:29.815 --> 04:31.492
the flower is the apple blossom,

04:31.595 --> 04:33.742
and Arkansas' dance is
the square dance.

04:34.227 --> 04:35.731
Doing some heavy reading?

04:35.867 --> 04:37.841
No. I had dinner
with Bob last night.

04:54.687 --> 04:57.131
So what time is
your appointment with the Mayor?

04:57.387 --> 04:59.261
He's dedicated
his entire day to me.

05:00.127 --> 05:03.170
He says he's excited to have
a "hot shot" scientist looking into this.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.611
How many patients
you looking at today?

05:07.168 --> 05:08.140
Five, I think.

05:08.248 --> 05:10.521
Unless another one walked off
the deep end since yesterday.

05:15.685 --> 05:17.381
Nice welcoming committee.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.490
Let's see if we can find out why.

05:21.578 --> 05:23.570
From New Orleans,
all the way up the Mississippi

05:23.717 --> 05:26.780
to Greanville there's been
a 50% increase in suicides.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.390
How many people
are we talking about?

05:28.485 --> 05:30.163
Almost 2,000 over the last year.

05:30.245 --> 05:32.951
Well, all I know is
it's tearing this place apart.

05:33.048 --> 05:34.912
I understand you've had
six suicides so far.

05:35.046 --> 05:37.613
Well, six officially,
but I'm saying seven.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.373
Milton Butterworth...

05:39.678 --> 05:42.053
he has a place
out there next to mine.

05:42.367 --> 05:46.512
His little daughter, Sarah, found
him in the corn crib, busted neck.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.231
The Medical Examiner
ruled accidental, but

05:50.536 --> 05:53.561
Milt was all torn up inside
for the last month or two.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.050
Torn up how?

05:55.985 --> 05:58.900
Just mopin' around.
Couldn't seem to get himself going.

05:58.985 --> 06:02.171
I've talked to him but
he just couldn't say what it was.

06:02.657 --> 06:05.393
- And the other six?
- Oh, I knew 'em all real well.

06:05.687 --> 06:07.341
There's the Arnolds' boy, and...

06:07.586 --> 06:09.670
the Nelsons' little girl, Katy.

06:11.418 --> 06:13.370
Goddamn it.
That was a hard one.

06:14.296 --> 06:17.032
She's just ten years old and
she took her daddy's hunting rifle.

06:19.427 --> 06:22.232
Look, I can get you the autopsy reports
on all the others if that'll help.

06:22.317 --> 06:24.041
- Everything'll help.
- Where do you want to start?

06:24.148 --> 06:25.970
I need to get samples.
Water. Soil. Air.

06:26.075 --> 06:28.003
And  I'm going to need
to see where these people lived.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.171
Not a problem.

06:30.088 --> 06:31.542
- Listen, Mayor...
- Oh, Ed.

06:31.765 --> 06:34.663
- Please. Mayor's not a payin' job.
- Okay, Ed.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.431
What do you think
is going on around here?

06:36.607 --> 06:38.102
What do I think?

06:38.315 --> 06:41.192
Well, Doc, I'll tell you.
This is the Middle America.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.460
Folks around here
don't get the big city blues.

06:43.657 --> 06:46.421
We worry about the price
of corn, not terrorist attacks.

06:47.518 --> 06:48.980
But I've got to
tell you that there's

06:49.088 --> 06:51.393
been a lot of talk about something
like that happening around here.

06:51.497 --> 06:53.772
- Terrorism?
- Isn't that why you're here?

06:54.358 --> 06:56.670
Isn't that what
you people deal with up there

06:56.827 --> 06:59.612
- in that hot shot biological lab of yours?
- Sometimes.

07:00.715 --> 07:03.651
So what do you think?
You got a notion of what it is?

07:04.236 --> 07:07.100
We think it has something
to do with these things called phorbols.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.992
They're plant esters.
We use them all the time in the lab

07:11.165 --> 07:13.791
as experimental tumor promoters.
They act by directly stimulating

07:14.618 --> 07:16.823
that protein kinase C, by bypassing
its normal calcium--

07:17.046 --> 07:20.292
- Oh, I had to ask.
- Sorry, my point is

07:20.547 --> 07:22.152
they're not supposed to be in us, and

07:22.365 --> 07:23.862
that's where we're finding them.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.653
All  right, we got all day
and I'm all ears.

07:26.968 --> 07:27.992
Lead on.

07:33.697 --> 07:35.372
Nice welcoming committee.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.401
Let's see if we can find out why.

07:43.007 --> 07:43.962
Hello...

07:44.296 --> 07:46.492
My name is Dr. Carlos Serrano.

07:47.106 --> 07:48.450
I'm here to help you.

07:49.058 --> 07:50.722
I'd like to check things out.

07:52.058 --> 07:53.502
Can you open your mouth for me?

07:54.526 --> 07:56.220
Your tongue is still there.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.300
Can't talk?

08:00.346 --> 08:02.541
Can you tell me how you feel?

08:03.218 --> 08:05.740
Like I want to go to
bed and sleep forever.

08:07.256 --> 08:08.701
You look sad.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.361
How sad?

08:13.148 --> 08:14.702
I can't, uh...

08:16.136 --> 08:19.542
From a scale of one to ten,
ten being the saddest.

08:21.697 --> 08:23.360
About a thousand.

08:26.258 --> 08:28.112
I just want it to go away.

08:28.547 --> 08:31.333
I want... I want to make it go away.

08:40.725 --> 08:44.120
Gotta give you credit, Doc.
You are one thorough son-of-a-gun.

08:44.225 --> 08:46.201
Yeah, well,
that's what science is all about.

08:46.408 --> 08:47.990
Looking at every little detail, and

08:48.166 --> 08:50.240
putting all the pieces
of the puzzle together.

08:50.545 --> 08:52.893
- You think the water might be poisoned?
- Could be.

08:53.415 --> 08:56.493
- You think that's what killed the deer?
- What deer?

08:58.745 --> 09:00.232
Aah, shit!

09:00.916 --> 09:02.861
One of them details
you might have missed.

09:02.961 --> 09:04.916
Yeah, thanks for pointing it out.

09:05.365 --> 09:07.930
Looks like it drowned
Something dragged it out.

09:08.254 --> 09:09.555
Raccoons'll do that.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.823
You get a lot of this down here?

09:10.995 --> 09:13.632
Dead animals?
After a tough winter.

09:14.898 --> 09:16.680
Pheasant. Rabbits.

09:16.908 --> 09:18.282
Deer  been on the rise.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.230
Too many of 'em.
Overpopulated the area.

09:21.776 --> 09:23.583
Think that's what's
making 'em so skittish.

09:23.716 --> 09:26.100
- Skittish?
- Oh, they been running around.

09:26.355 --> 09:29.961
Mike Davis runs the hardware store,
found one in his pool the other day.

09:30.457 --> 09:32.630
Got a freezer full
of venison out of it.

09:33.247 --> 09:36.242
- Suicidal animals?
- I know. I know. It's out there.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.792
Animals don't commit suicide.

09:39.458 --> 09:41.730
Neither did anybody else
in this town for the last 30 years,

09:41.908 --> 09:43.651
so who's to say that
whatever's cutting through here

09:43.736 --> 09:45.191
isn't affecting the animal
population as well?

09:46.217 --> 09:47.333
- It's possible.
- Yeah.

09:47.388 --> 09:50.311
You know, a virus
or a bacteria in the deer

09:50.446 --> 09:53.003
or whatever the fuck
they hunt for down here.

09:53.356 --> 09:56.093
Maybe that's how the victims got
the phorbols into their system.

09:56.727 --> 09:58.253
Well, it's certainly worth a look.

09:58.388 --> 10:00.723
- How'd you make out?
- No common links on the surface.

10:00.825 --> 10:02.931
I'm hoping that the blood
chemistry will tell us something.

10:03.726 --> 10:05.531
Oh, and that ambulance
we saw this morning.

10:05.617 --> 10:07.033
- Yeah?
- It was another suicide.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.083
Oh shit.

10:08.938 --> 10:10.302
Well, Greanville...

10:10.777 --> 10:12.320
it's been depressing.

10:13.165 --> 10:13.860
Yeah.

10:24.918 --> 10:27.561
Yeah, we're just getting back
to the lab now. How ya doing?

10:27.717 --> 10:29.782
<i>- Good.
- Where are you?</i>

10:30.427 --> 10:32.293
I'm just at the center.

10:32.858 --> 10:35.502
I got out of this seriously
intense counselling session.

10:35.767 --> 10:37.430
Oh yeah?
So, it's good?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.233
Yeah, totally good.
Thanks, David.

10:39.336 --> 10:42.181
No man, you're the one who's doing it.
Listen, you keep with this program,

10:42.326 --> 10:44.533
you stay clean and I'll take you
to Montreal for graduation.

10:44.635 --> 10:46.020
Good food. Beautiful women.

10:47.456 --> 10:49.372
Awesome. I gotta go.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.471
<i>Oh, alright. Well...
I'll see you later tonight.</i>

10:58.496 --> 11:00.683
- David.
- Oh, not now, Wes. I'm busy.

11:00.895 --> 11:02.510
- I'll see you up there.
- I need to talk to you.

11:02.717 --> 11:05.542
The only thing I want to talk to you
about is Harlan Sendak's missing research.

11:05.728 --> 11:08.133
- I don't know where it is.
- Yeah. That makes two of us.

11:08.588 --> 11:09.790
I'll find it.

11:10.035 --> 11:11.872
Yeah, you get right on that, Wes.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.950
One question. Why was the
research in the back of your car?

11:17.316 --> 11:19.261
Like I said, Wes, I'm busy.

11:20.057 --> 11:21.542
Don't ever touch me again.

11:26.857 --> 11:29.521
David!
Welcome back.

11:29.717 --> 11:32.153
- I have some really good news.
- I want you guys to drop everything

11:32.317 --> 11:34.613
and take a look at this
water sample every way you can.

11:35.005 --> 11:36.571
- Okay.
- Viruses, bacteria,

11:36.698 --> 11:38.722
- toxins, anything that doesn't belong.
- Got it.

11:38.848 --> 11:40.932
I need some answers
and get Bob on this too, today.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.093
- David.
- Yeah, what?

11:43.406 --> 11:45.890
Well, the needle
in the haystack? I found it.

11:46.547 --> 11:48.481
- You found the retrovirus?
- Yeah!

11:49.357 --> 11:51.691
Check it against all the databases
of viral genome sequences?

11:51.826 --> 11:52.840
I did. No match.

11:52.956 --> 11:55.410
- It's definitely an original.
- And it's definitely a retrovirus?

11:56.405 --> 11:58.383
- Well what took you so long?
- Funny.

11:58.575 --> 12:00.191
All right, let's keep this quiet.

12:00.285 --> 12:02.442
Do you know if this is in the Korean
stem cell line or is it everywhere?

12:02.567 --> 12:04.080
- Don't know yet.
- Okay, keep working.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.543
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.730
Okay, Jona...

12:29.288 --> 12:30.162
I know you.

12:31.258 --> 12:33.570
- What?
- We met.

12:34.445 --> 12:35.102
No.

12:35.258 --> 12:37.232
Yeah. At the club,
in the East Village.

12:37.445 --> 12:38.993
In New York?

12:39.195 --> 12:40.020
No!

12:40.678 --> 12:42.642
You must have been wasted.

12:42.977 --> 12:44.920
You're insane.
I've never met you.

12:45.058 --> 12:47.292
- And you're not from New York.
- Hey. True shit.

12:48.717 --> 12:52.300
I got off at the wrong subway... stop.

12:52.466 --> 12:55.291
Uh... Where'd you get the coffee?

12:55.566 --> 12:56.693
There.

12:57.586 --> 12:59.702
- Where?
- Just over there!

12:59.946 --> 13:03.270
- Over where?
- Oh my God! Right where it says fucking coffee.

13:03.388 --> 13:05.430
- Can't you read?
- No, I'm...

13:05.935 --> 13:08.350
- I'm blind.
- Great.

13:08.618 --> 13:11.422
Can you help me
find it? Please? Ow!

13:13.266 --> 13:14.843
My knee!

13:15.276 --> 13:16.912
I did a comparative LC-MS report

13:17.036 --> 13:19.343
on the two brain samples
you brought back.

13:19.457 --> 13:21.003
Both victims had phorbols.

13:21.178 --> 13:24.211
The samples were fresher,
so I was able to detect higher levels.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.333
- What levels?
- MacDonald had 4.85

13:27.447 --> 13:29.800
- and Deer had 6.7.
- You know that guy, Deer?

13:29.945 --> 13:31.140
- Yeah.
- Is a deer.

13:31.317 --> 13:32.882
- An animal deer?
- Yep.

13:33.078 --> 13:36.613
So the same phorbols that are causing
suicide and depression in humans

13:36.788 --> 13:38.442
- are in the deer too?
- Maybe.

13:38.716 --> 13:40.282
Where are you at
with that water sample?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.890
Normal viruses and bacteria.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

13:42.987 --> 13:45.712
- I'll have a toxicology report in a little while.
- Okay, good.

13:45.855 --> 13:47.563
Wait a minute.
I thought you said phorbols

13:47.685 --> 13:49.863
- came from plants?
- Well, they do.

13:50.945 --> 13:53.361
Okay, what about
the food source?

13:53.558 --> 13:56.001
Well, it would have to be
in plants that animals eat.

13:56.677 --> 13:59.011
Or breathe.
Could it be in pollen?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.161
We'll make a scientist out of you yet.

14:01.355 --> 14:02.901
What about disease?

14:03.165 --> 14:06.240
Yeah,  it could be a disease
we share with other mammals.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.650
Carlos, where are you at with those
samples you brought back from Arkansas?

14:10.775 --> 14:12.570
Running tests on
blood tissue and urine.

14:13.847 --> 14:15.382
Well. We got our marching orders.

14:15.558 --> 14:16.681
Let's go.

14:51.147 --> 14:54.483
Okay,  so I'm gonna have my own TV show.
And it's gonna start 5 minutes late

14:54.597 --> 14:56.413
because everybody's 5
minutes late anyway, right?

14:56.536 --> 14:57.851
Yeah, that's cool.

14:58.018 --> 15:01.141
Okay, so it's going to be a reality
show about me meeting superstars.

15:01.345 --> 15:04.270
And then, like, the movie stars,
they're going to act like rock stars,

15:04.398 --> 15:06.340
and the rock stars they're going
to act like supermodels

15:06.427 --> 15:08.160
and the supermodels like movie stars.

15:09.587 --> 15:11.612
So, are we gonna smoke?

15:13.456 --> 15:14.992
I have crystal.

15:15.528 --> 15:17.892
No... I'm clean these days.

15:18.677 --> 15:21.133
- Do you mind if I do?
- No, go ahead.
// FIN PARTIE 1

15:33.285 --> 15:34.981
There's no connection whatsoever...

15:36.106 --> 15:38.022
Okay, thanks, Paul.

15:38.947 --> 15:42.123
So there is nothing in the lungs
of the dead or the patients

15:42.275 --> 15:44.731
that indicates pollen,
other than what you'd expect to find

15:44.868 --> 15:48.290
in a farming community. We'll keep
pursuing it, but plants seem unlikely.

15:48.727 --> 15:51.782
I just got a call from
Paul Nixon down at the CDC.

15:51.986 --> 15:54.013
He says they got no record of diseases

15:54.137 --> 15:56.971
between humans and animals
that involve phorbols. So...

15:58.455 --> 16:00.660
I guess that leaves water.

16:09.606 --> 16:11.762
My show's going to be
called Ramona's Revenge.

16:12.026 --> 16:14.072
- Oh, is that your name?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:14.227 --> 16:15.931
- I'm Owen.
- Hey.

16:16.188 --> 16:18.233
So anyways...
In my show, right.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.020
I'm going to come to your house,
and I'm going to make it uglier.

16:21.178 --> 16:24.102
And I'm going to give people makeovers
to what they really should look like.

16:24.285 --> 16:25.733
So assholes,
they're going to look

16:25.897 --> 16:30.123
like giant assholes, and bitches
are going to look like big bitches.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.580
Do you think I'm beautiful?

16:37.886 --> 16:39.300
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:39.936 --> 16:40.942
Yeah.

16:42.115 --> 16:43.702
Beautiful enough to fuck me?

16:45.515 --> 16:47.221
No, no. You've got to do this.

16:47.556 --> 16:49.293
You've got to do this.
You've got to do it.

16:49.385 --> 16:51.400
You've got to do it. Do it.

17:14.795 --> 17:16.480
Fucking so beautiful.

17:20.337 --> 17:22.522
Fuck, I knew
we'd find something in the water.

17:23.026 --> 17:26.123
We're not sure what kind of eggs
but they're definitely eggs.

17:27.266 --> 17:29.032
Cute little bastards, aren't they?

17:29.156 --> 17:32.631
Those are from the pond. But I also found
them in the tap water sample from Greanville.

17:32.806 --> 17:34.471
Shit, so it's in the water table.

17:34.756 --> 17:36.713
I'm trying to grow the eggs. Not easy.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.883
I'm sure Jill will give you
a hand, won't you, Jill?

17:39.295 --> 17:41.181
You are, after all,
the brilliant scientist

17:41.345 --> 17:42.692
who discovered a previously
unknown retrovirus.

17:42.906 --> 17:43.830
Right you are.

17:43.968 --> 17:45.560
Very good. Good work, guys.

18:02.446 --> 18:04.281
PARASITE

18:04.546 --> 18:05.752
It's gotta be.

18:08.718 --> 18:10.753
²I gotta stay beautiful.

18:18.085 --> 18:19.751
You're fucking crazy.

18:21.585 --> 18:22.850
What did you say?

18:23.776 --> 18:25.770
You think I'm crazy? Ah!

18:30.318 --> 18:32.593
I don't give a fuck
what you think, okay?

18:32.716 --> 18:34.351
'cause they're the crazy ones!

18:38.165 --> 18:41.463
I think I'm gonna kill her. I think
I'm going to push her down the stairs.

18:41.526 --> 18:42.852
- Who?
- I'm going to push...

18:43.018 --> 18:45.000
my sister down the stairs.

18:45.548 --> 18:47.222
- What?
- My fucking therapist says

18:47.337 --> 18:49.201
the firstborns are
supposed to be achievers,

18:49.347 --> 18:50.262
suckups...

18:50.575 --> 18:53.330
and that the youngest is
supposed to be the rebel, but...

18:53.995 --> 18:56.390
My fucking sister stole my fucking job!

19:20.237 --> 19:21.150
Ramona!

19:21.447 --> 19:23.222
Come on. Come on, get up!

19:23.405 --> 19:24.522
Come on! Come on!

19:24.627 --> 19:26.250
Come on! Come on!
You gotta walk around.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.833
You've got to walk around! Come on!

19:28.057 --> 19:30.101
You've got to walk
around! Come on! Come on!

19:30.666 --> 19:32.943
Ramona, you've got to breathe!
You've got to breathe!

19:33.115 --> 19:34.710
Come on! Wake up!

19:34.968 --> 19:36.932
Breathe! Come on!

19:40.067 --> 19:42.320
- Sir, Caroline is up in her office.
- Thank you.

19:42.678 --> 19:44.390
- Everything all right?
- Just fine.

19:54.886 --> 19:55.983
I know.

19:56.397 --> 19:58.121
I know.

19:59.048 --> 19:59.781
I...

20:01.188 --> 20:03.162
I've got to go, Audrey.

20:04.465 --> 20:06.940
Yeah, I appreciate your patience.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.542
You too. Bye.

20:13.366 --> 20:15.480
So you just couldn't stay away.

20:15.928 --> 20:17.052
Audrey Graves?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.951
Have you found that research?

20:20.157 --> 20:21.332
Not yet.

20:29.985 --> 20:32.102
That'll get you in
anywhere you want to go.

20:32.287 --> 20:34.573
Even down to where
we throw out the rat crap.

20:35.158 --> 20:37.320
If you find what
you're looking for, let me know.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.752
- You sound a little upset.
- I am upset.

20:40.905 --> 20:42.893
Hey. I'm just doing my job.

20:43.205 --> 20:46.551
Really? Maybe someday you
can tell me what that job is.

20:48.065 --> 20:49.842
I'm  not the enemy.

20:57.938 --> 20:59.580
He's just over here.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.300
What kind of worms?

21:02.507 --> 21:04.872
Yeah? Well, look. Just send me
everything you've got.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.222
- Right.
- David.

21:06.476 --> 21:07.961
Hang on.
Not now, Wes. Sorry.

21:08.127 --> 21:10.510
- There's somebody here you need to talk to.
- Not now, Wes.

21:10.597 --> 21:12.273
- David.
- Hang on.

21:12.808 --> 21:15.173
There's a police officer
who would like to speak to you.

21:16.846 --> 21:18.832
Jimmy, I'm going to
have to call you back.

21:20.286 --> 21:22.042
Hi. David Sandstrom.

21:22.226 --> 21:24.100
Monica Milovsky.
Juvenile Task Force.

21:24.236 --> 21:26.281
Oh fuck. Owen.
What did he do?

21:26.696 --> 21:29.062
- You are his uncle, right?
- Is that what he said?

21:29.838 --> 21:33.480
No. The kid's just latched
onto me. I don't know why...

21:33.586 --> 21:35.210
I'm just trying to help
him out. What happened?

21:35.338 --> 21:37.883
According to Owen
he was with a girl, 14.

21:37.925 --> 21:39.191
Ramona Capobianco.

21:39.405 --> 21:41.673
They smoked crystal meth.
She started to turn blue.

21:41.977 --> 21:44.292
He took a vehicle registered to you.

21:44.376 --> 21:45.952
Drove Ramona to hospital emergency.

21:46.066 --> 21:47.941
He panicked and
left her on the sidewalk.

21:48.535 --> 21:50.600
He drove away
and into a TTC bus.

21:51.557 --> 21:52.943
- He's fine.
- Good.

21:53.666 --> 21:55.062
The girl died.

21:58.106 --> 22:01.280
Oh. Let me get my coat.

22:03.665 --> 22:05.372
What's the charge?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.872
We're asking for Criminal
Negligence Causing Death.

22:08.186 --> 22:11.700
You know, he helped bust up this marijuana
grow up in the subways of New York.

22:11.886 --> 22:13.533
It was making a lot
of people really sick.

22:13.716 --> 22:15.553
I mean, is that going
to count for anything?

22:16.238 --> 22:18.680
- Is everything okay?
- I'll talk to you later.

22:21.657 --> 22:23.151
It's all right.

22:46.447 --> 22:48.443
- I fucked up.
- No shit.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.230
I'm sorry.

22:53.027 --> 22:55.521
I'm not the one you need
to say sorry to, Owen.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.452
I tried mouth-to-mouth.
I got her to the hospital.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.182
You left her
on the fucking sidewalk.

23:01.937 --> 23:05.170
Why didn't you take her into emergency?
They could have saved her life, maybe.

23:05.365 --> 23:07.190
- She died in the car.
- Oh, you're a doctor, now?

23:07.477 --> 23:09.343
I've been there. She was dead.

23:12.607 --> 23:14.750
Did you give her the shit?

23:15.497 --> 23:17.082
No. It was hers.

23:19.275 --> 23:21.140
I swear, David.

23:23.218 --> 23:25.002
Did you smoke it with her?

23:27.787 --> 23:28.973
Yeah, I did.

23:29.315 --> 23:30.503
Fuck.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.651
Why, Owen? Why?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.113
You ever been there?

23:40.045 --> 23:43.901
Where you can see
everything so fucking...

23:44.907 --> 23:48.293
intensely.
And every fucking minute without it...

23:49.748 --> 23:52.642
everything's just nothing, you know and...

23:53.328 --> 23:55.360
it's not so hard to go there.

24:02.095 --> 24:04.231
Well that's it.
I've got to call your parents.

24:04.396 --> 24:05.302
You can't.

24:06.726 --> 24:08.372
You're in jail, Owen.

24:08.455 --> 24:10.982
In a foreign country.
With no passport.

24:11.436 --> 24:13.201
I've got to call your parents.

24:13.478 --> 24:15.253
I don't know where they are.

24:15.535 --> 24:17.271
My dad's a drunk,
my mom was,

24:17.397 --> 24:19.412
until she found Jesus,
and now blames me

24:19.497 --> 24:21.183
for putting the fucking devil in her life.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.383
Spare me, all right?

24:22.766 --> 24:24.180
My dad's an asshole.

24:24.485 --> 24:25.951
I'm an asshole, too.

24:26.135 --> 24:28.373
But at least I try to be
a better asshole, okay?

24:28.497 --> 24:30.220
It's in our DNA
to improve the species.

24:30.486 --> 24:32.603
So when you're ready
to join the rest of us...

24:34.658 --> 24:36.302
I've tried.

24:37.266 --> 24:39.233
I tried 50 fucking times.

24:40.048 --> 24:41.853
I've been in plenty of drug programs.

24:42.005 --> 24:45.480
I was in a summer camp for 2 months.
I was straight as a fucking line of coke.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.362
I got out and I cracked, okay? I'm...

24:48.545 --> 24:49.982
My life's fucked.

24:51.036 --> 24:52.970
It's looking a lot
brighter than Ramona's.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.613
I'm sorry.

24:57.105 --> 24:58.402
I am.

24:59.186 --> 25:00.643
I know she's dead.

25:03.228 --> 25:05.283
I just met her.

25:07.678 --> 25:10.633
I was clean.
I didn't want to smoke that shit.

25:14.436 --> 25:16.872
- I fucked up.
- Yeah, you did, Owen.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.980
You really did.
// FIN PARTIE A

25:47.405 --> 25:49.352
I heard about the
police. Is everything--

25:49.436 --> 25:51.963
It's fine, Bob. Don't worry about it.
How's it going with the suicides?

25:52.078 --> 25:53.572
Jill's growing the eggs.

26:01.746 --> 26:03.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:04.746 --> 26:07.553
I spoke with the medical examiners
who did the postmortems.

26:07.938 --> 26:10.291
A lot of skepticism
about the parasite theory.

26:10.425 --> 26:12.352
No one's ever heard of a
parasite that produces phorbols.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.922
Why don't you quit?

26:14.317 --> 26:15.720
Cigarettes.

26:16.078 --> 26:17.400
Ah, uh...

26:17.875 --> 26:20.312
- Nobody likes a quitter.
- Seriously.

26:21.108 --> 26:24.403
I've tried quitting a hundred times.
It's an addiction.

26:25.917 --> 26:30.130
- You don't have any addictions?
- Just booze, cigars, hockey and sex.

26:30.325 --> 26:33.352
- How long you been at it?
- Um... since I'm 14.

26:33.735 --> 26:36.950
So you figure it's pretty much
part of your biochemistry now, eh?

26:38.696 --> 26:40.982
Yeah... I have an addiction to nicotine.

26:41.185 --> 26:43.281
But do you consider yourself an addict?

26:44.356 --> 26:45.552
I suppose...

26:45.656 --> 26:47.772
- Did your parents smoke?
- No, actually...

26:47.968 --> 26:49.023
- David!
- Gotta go.

26:53.926 --> 26:55.263
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:55.408 --> 26:56.731
Come on in.

26:56.918 --> 26:58.360
- Close the door.
- Okay.

27:01.635 --> 27:03.102
- What's up?
- Did you get my message?

27:03.327 --> 27:05.071
About Owen? Yeah. Shit.

27:05.727 --> 27:07.510
- Yeah.
- He's doing okay?

27:07.678 --> 27:09.910
Well bail's gonna be tough
because he's a pretty good candidate

27:10.005 --> 27:11.553
- for running away.
- No kidding.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.270
The deal is if he doesn't get bail,
they could lock him up for two years

27:15.507 --> 27:17.231
before he gets a chance to go to trial.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.173
Might be good for him.

27:19.758 --> 27:22.480
Yeah, I hear there's a lot
of good role models in prison.

27:22.898 --> 27:24.802
It would be harsh,
David, but he'd get clean.

27:24.846 --> 27:26.573
I don't want him
going to jail! Okay?

27:28.176 --> 27:29.933
What did you want
to see me about?

27:33.938 --> 27:35.520
Genetics as a defence.

27:36.706 --> 27:39.731
- It isn't.
- No, work wh me here, okay.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.693
- You say you're an addict, right?
- Yeah.

27:43.055 --> 27:44.702
What about your parents?

27:46.327 --> 27:48.433
- They were both alcoholics.
- Okay, so there you go.

27:48.597 --> 27:52.531
I mean, what about a genetic
predisposition to addiction?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.832
I mean, did you ever
look into it for yourself?

27:54.915 --> 27:56.243
You can't cure him, David.

27:56.345 --> 27:59.250
- A genetic treatment is at least 10 years off.
- Ah, okay.

27:59.857 --> 28:02.933
So you have looked into it.
What'd you find out?

28:03.238 --> 28:06.043
- You're opening a can of worms here.
- That wasn't my question.

28:07.558 --> 28:09.690
We're not just genes!

28:10.668 --> 28:13.310
Why don't we let
a judge decide that?

28:21.748 --> 28:25.791
We'd like an adjournment of 24 hours,
as my client is undergoing medical testing.

28:26.077 --> 28:28.343
The Crown sees the
request as reasonable.

28:28.526 --> 28:30.021
So does the judge.

28:31.265 --> 28:33.930
Let me see... Tomorrow, 2 PM.

28:34.445 --> 28:37.290
I'll see you all then.
Court is adjourned.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.113
Owen, I want you to
spit your gum into that.

28:43.245 --> 28:45.081
If this is a drug test, I'm clean.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.660
Let's let the judge decide.

28:49.345 --> 28:50.823
See you tomorrow.

28:51.136 --> 28:52.780
Okay, let's go.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.500
Bob!

29:01.068 --> 29:02.343
Bob.

29:02.656 --> 29:05.140
There are 36 genes linked to
addictive personalities, right?

29:05.298 --> 29:08.321
38, I believe as of
the most recent analysis.

29:08.786 --> 29:11.062
Here's Owen's DNA.
I want you to run it against them.

29:11.195 --> 29:12.872
See if you get any hits.

29:13.357 --> 29:15.802
Bob... the eggs.
Anything hatch yet?

29:15.985 --> 29:17.813
- Nope, they're still growing.
- Okay.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.562
- Hi, Carlos.
- Hi, Bob.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.930
After you do Owen's,
can you do mine?

29:29.138 --> 29:32.550
Because if I don't have
addiction genes maybe then I can quit.

29:53.095 --> 29:56.711
<i>That meth is carving a pathway through
your veins trying to get to your brain.</i>

30:10.015 --> 30:11.443
<i>Look, I know I fucked up.</i>

30:31.988 --> 30:34.163
All right, I will see your four dollars

30:34.245 --> 30:36.292
and then I will raise you...

30:39.517 --> 30:41.553
- a hundred bucks.
- You're bluffing.

30:41.938 --> 30:43.641
- Try me.
- I'm out.

30:44.268 --> 30:46.992
He's out.
And he knows how to play.

30:47.636 --> 30:50.880
You guys should have seen
Caroline and Wes arguing in her office.

30:51.058 --> 30:54.513
Man, she was mad and
he wasn't backing down.

30:54.748 --> 30:57.062
- About what?
- I don't know.

30:57.217 --> 30:58.951
I did hear a mention
of Connor McGuinn.

30:59.137 --> 31:00.883
That guy gives me the creeps.

31:01.515 --> 31:04.101
. I'm out.
- I thought I was bluffing?

31:04.317 --> 31:06.303
You are, I just can't
afford to prove it.

31:06.685 --> 31:09.271
- Okay, me too. I fold.
- You in, or you out, Bob?

31:14.758 --> 31:17.211
- Owen's test results from the lab.
- Oh!

31:17.367 --> 31:20.291
Good, I asked them to email them to you
as soon as the analysis came in.

31:20.455 --> 31:21.850
Thanks, Bob.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.013
Holy shit!

31:24.588 --> 31:27.800
32 out of 38 gene samples
match for addiction.

31:30.618 --> 31:32.551
Call. What are you holding, David?

31:35.635 --> 31:37.893
- Pair of 2s.
- I knew you were bluffing.

31:38.198 --> 31:39.410
Only at cards.

31:39.627 --> 31:41.552
- Pair of Jacks.
- Nice!

31:41.817 --> 31:44.610
Very good!
Outstanding! Again!

31:46.155 --> 31:50.071
- Who is CS?
- I asked Bob to test my genes as well.

31:50.216 --> 31:52.070
Well, my friend...

31:52.535 --> 31:55.560
6 out of 38 matches.
Below average.

31:57.446 --> 31:59.243
Well, I just quit smoking!

31:59.328 --> 32:01.160
- Attaboy!
- Outstanding.

32:01.747 --> 32:03.983
I don't believe it. // FIN PARTIE 2

32:10.236 --> 32:12.042
I checked with the parasitology guys.

32:12.236 --> 32:13.501
Nobody's ever seen this before.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.633
We find these guys in
the humans or the deer?

32:15.847 --> 32:17.510
Nothing yet.
No eggs either.

32:18.265 --> 32:19.872
The worms produce phorbols?

32:20.887 --> 32:22.022
David, it doesn't matter.

32:22.127 --> 32:24.173
We still haven't found the worms
in any of the victims.

32:25.768 --> 32:27.412
In any of the dead victims.

32:27.605 --> 32:29.952
In the dead. We need to look
for these guys in the living.

32:30.277 --> 32:31.643
David, another victim.

32:31.776 --> 32:34.463
A little girl, twelve, about
fifteen miles north of Greanville.

32:34.868 --> 32:36.551
- So it's spreading.
- What is?

32:37.817 --> 32:39.073
Parasitic worms.

32:39.206 --> 32:40.883
- We think.
- In the goddamn water.

32:40.978 --> 32:42.772
There may be a connection
with the suicides.

32:42.916 --> 32:45.020
Do we know how the
worms got in the water?

32:45.255 --> 32:47.001
First case of suicide,
associated with depression

32:47.157 --> 32:49.630
was about 20 kilometres up
the Mississippi from New Orleans

32:49.838 --> 32:52.640
around the same time
Hurricane Katrina made landfall.

32:52.755 --> 32:54.551
That's probably it, it blew in
on the tail of a hurricane.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.920
- From where?
- We got plenty of time to figure that out.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.710
Right now we have to confirm
that this is the parasite.

32:58.848 --> 33:00.891
So Bob, get to work on the worm,
find out if it produces phorbols.

33:01.057 --> 33:03.431
- I'll get on the worms.
- Okay, Carlos, go back to Greanville.

33:03.588 --> 33:06.180
See if you can find worms
in the... depressed people.

33:06.348 --> 33:08.852
And Jill, I want you to
turn these worms inside out.

33:09.046 --> 33:10.830
Find out what they eat,
what they shit...

33:10.937 --> 33:12.762
- What their favorite TV show is.
- Where are you going?

33:13.445 --> 33:14.710
Court.

33:15.888 --> 33:17.261
Court?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.953
Owen is a kid who has a history

33:21.107 --> 33:22.991
of drug and alcohol abuse.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.862
But so do his parents.
And the relevance of that is that

33:26.976 --> 33:30.610
recent research is building
a very strong argument to suggest

33:30.756 --> 33:33.293
the connection between
addiction and genetics.

33:37.607 --> 33:41.432
There are 38 genes
that we know of right now

33:41.565 --> 33:43.651
associated with addictive behavior.

33:44.268 --> 33:48.301
In an average person, about 30 of those
would be normal, or the yellow dots.

33:48.475 --> 33:51.781
Maybe a few red dots,
which could suggest addictive traits.

33:52.355 --> 33:56.403
For example, let's say you had a gene
that gave you low levels of adrenalin.

33:56.717 --> 33:59.151
Well, your body craves
a certain amount of adrenalin,

33:59.286 --> 34:02.271
so anybody who had that gene
might become a thrill-seeker.

34:02.536 --> 34:05.371
Or let's say you had a gene that
made you very easily stressed out.

34:05.455 --> 34:08.281
That could lead to addictive behavior, because
you might take up smoking. Or if you had a gene

34:08.417 --> 34:12.920
that gave you low serotonin. Well, drugs
actually raise your serotonin levels...

34:13.056 --> 34:14.992
So... or you could... No, okay...

34:15.117 --> 34:18.003
The theory is that if you have
enough of these genes lined up

34:19.094 --> 34:21.262
you're more likely to become an addict.

34:22.188 --> 34:23.762
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.792
- And Owen has...?
- Oh! This is Owen.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.632
32 out of 38.

34:33.186 --> 34:34.551
32 out of 38,

34:34.757 --> 34:36.313
how unusual is that?

34:36.525 --> 34:39.882
The average person could pretty
easily overcome eight red dots.

34:40.327 --> 34:42.963
So 32 would be

34:43.094 --> 34:45.213
like drawing
4 aces 4 times in a row.

34:45.976 --> 34:48.063
I mean, in my opinion, Owen

34:48.375 --> 34:50.771
had a genetic destiny
to become an addict. His...

34:51.108 --> 34:53.141
his free will barely had a chance.

34:56.456 --> 34:57.772
Thank you.

35:01.518 --> 35:05.080
I won't argue the science,
though it is new and experimental.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.173
I'm more concerned
about the legal ramifications.

35:07.655 --> 35:08.751
I understand.

35:08.925 --> 35:11.483
If we don't punish him? What's going
to stop him from re-offending?

35:12.748 --> 35:15.792
Yeah, but putting him in
a juvenile detention centre for 2 years

35:15.997 --> 35:17.453
is like putting
him in a criminal school.

35:17.588 --> 35:19.393
Are you an expert on criminology?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.063
No...

35:22.347 --> 35:23.940
Where should we put him then?

35:24.597 --> 35:27.192
That's what I'm saying. AA or...

35:27.496 --> 35:30.712
counselling centres. I mean,
these are all great ideas, but if...

35:30.926 --> 35:33.140
- If addiction is in the genes...
- That wouldn't help?

35:33.288 --> 35:35.292
No. If you had genes telling you

35:35.428 --> 35:37.922
that you had red hair and then
you went and dyed it black.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.842
- Your hair would be red.
- Exactly.

35:42.108 --> 35:44.510
Owen is, what you might call,

35:44.708 --> 35:47.561
a classic case of genetic predisposition.

35:50.026 --> 35:52.161
Wouldn't it be better
to put him in a hospital?

35:52.327 --> 35:54.682
And check his genetic coding?

35:54.838 --> 35:57.470
Study it.
Find a way to help him,

35:58.488 --> 36:00.563
instead of just throwing him away.

36:05.096 --> 36:08.013
Court is adjourned while
I consider your arguments.

36:11.157 --> 36:12.371
There.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.873
I was able to collect
some of that liquid.

36:17.796 --> 36:19.792
Trace of phorbols, David.

36:21.136 --> 36:22.440
Good work, Bob.

36:22.676 --> 36:24.660
- Jill helped too.
- Fuck!

36:28.675 --> 36:30.610
Fucking shit!

36:31.046 --> 36:32.163
Bob wait!

36:32.396 --> 36:34.152
- What is that?
- David?

36:34.305 --> 36:35.533
What is it?

36:35.657 --> 36:38.352
Concentrated retrovirus in medium.

36:38.585 --> 36:40.241
- Shower now.
- Fuck!

36:53.276 --> 36:55.710
I don't know what happened.
It just blew up.

36:55.935 --> 36:58.112
Let's get you to the hospital
and have you checked out.

36:58.506 --> 36:59.911
The chances of getting infected--

37:00.037 --> 37:02.111
It's listed as Full Precaution.
You know that.

37:02.268 --> 37:04.033
Yeah, for viruses like Ebola.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.122
Look, you've sequenced the retrovirus
but you don't know

37:06.258 --> 37:08.890
if it can give you a headache
or some kind of new immunodeficiency.

37:09.747 --> 37:11.802
It looks like the vortex
might have been off kilter.

37:12.086 --> 37:15.063
What? That's bullshit.
That doesn't just happen.

37:15.386 --> 37:17.870
Jill, let's just...
get you to the hospital.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.282
How are you
feeling today, Jackson?

37:27.175 --> 37:29.081
Have you ever had an ultrasound?

37:30.166 --> 37:33.173
Just relax.
This is called a transducer

37:33.827 --> 37:36.870
and what it does,
is it transmits an image

37:37.028 --> 37:41.323
to the screen
of what's going on inside.

37:44.005 --> 37:47.453
Let's see... Clear image now.

38:02.206 --> 38:04.550
- It's okay, sit back down.
- That's in me?!

38:04.716 --> 38:06.242
Jackson, sit down please.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.362
Lie back. Just relax.

38:08.565 --> 38:10.580
It's going to be fine. Okay?

38:12.007 --> 38:15.100
So far her health is excellent
and the doctors think...

38:15.285 --> 38:17.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about your investigation?

38:20.007 --> 38:22.681
My conclusion is that the accident
was caused by her negligence.

38:22.806 --> 38:23.971
Oh, bullshit!

38:24.097 --> 38:26.153
You're supposed to check
the vortex before you use it.

38:26.336 --> 38:28.980
Whatever. What caused
the malfunction, Wes?

38:29.395 --> 38:33.533
- We're working on it.
- Swell. I feel so much better now.

38:34.055 --> 38:35.763
Thank you, Wes.

38:39.387 --> 38:41.450
What the fuck is going
on around here, Caroline?

38:41.697 --> 38:42.560
I don't know.

38:42.655 --> 38:44.201
You don't know or
you're not going to tell me?

38:44.326 --> 38:45.722
I don't know, David.
I don't know.

38:46.015 --> 38:47.142
Yeah.

38:47.475 --> 38:49.571
Research doesn't just vanish

38:49.676 --> 38:51.530
and Jill doesn't just fuck up.

38:55.547 --> 38:56.470
Hello...

38:56.706 --> 38:59.502
David, you said you wanted
the news right away. Well, we have it.

38:59.645 --> 39:01.341
About the parasites you brought back?

39:01.487 --> 39:04.841
The mature worms release about
3 micrograms of phorbols per hour.

39:05.036 --> 39:07.413
The boy I examined: 62 worms.

39:07.656 --> 39:10.782
- Jesus.
- That's 4.464 milligrams per day.

39:10.898 --> 39:13.663
Enough to raise your PKC,
so you're suicidally depressed.

39:14.266 --> 39:17.392
- Where are the worms coming from?
- They lay their eggs in the water.

39:17.737 --> 39:19.951
-That's where their life cycle begins.
- Exactly.

39:20.188 --> 39:23.023
They're mimicking
Nematomorph hairworms.

39:23.177 --> 39:24.052
What?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.713
Oh. I just finished reading about them.
They're these creepy little bastards.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.223
See, they develop in grasshoppers
until they need to reproduce.

39:30.805 --> 39:34.443
And then they brainwash the grasshopper
host by releasing all these proteins.

39:34.595 --> 39:37.862
The proteins tell the grasshopper to
jump in the water. It does and drowns.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.741
Okay, so they need to
get to the water to breed.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.811
- Yes!
- See, the worms are inside you.

39:43.995 --> 39:46.681
But they need to get out and spread to
other people in order to avoid extinction.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.720
So they make you confused and
depressed until you take your own life.

39:49.927 --> 39:52.111
Then they get out. They mate.
They lay eggs in the water

39:52.265 --> 39:55.082
and they wait for the next victim
to come along and drink up the eggs.

39:55.246 --> 39:56.603
We think that the human brain

39:56.695 --> 39:58.623
cannot be as easily
controlled as smaller animals,

39:58.745 --> 40:00.650
that's why all of our victims
did not end up in the water.

40:01.096 --> 40:02.881
Can we treat it?
Kill the parasite?

40:03.108 --> 40:06.002
There can be up to a hundred different
parasites living in the human body.

40:06.197 --> 40:09.663
A roundworm is quite common.
It can lay up to 200,000 eggs a day.

40:09.905 --> 40:11.901
Hookworm larvae go through the skin.

40:12.056 --> 40:14.152
Pinworm can infect
one in five children--

40:14.357 --> 40:15.883
Okay Bob, your point is?

40:16.317 --> 40:18.420
They're all treatable
as long as you know they're there.

40:18.737 --> 40:20.513
In other words.
Yeah, we have a chance.

40:20.738 --> 40:22.700
Okay, I'll alert the
Governor of Arkansas.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.721
You better alert the governor of Missouri,
Iowa and Illinois while you're at it.

40:25.885 --> 40:27.972
We don't know how far
this has spread up the Mississippi.

40:29.566 --> 40:31.842
Guys... Good work.

40:36.817 --> 40:38.612
Whenever you want to talk.

40:46.047 --> 40:47.231
Come in.

40:48.457 --> 40:49.912
- Hi.
- Caroline.

40:51.068 --> 40:53.443
Honey, you don't really need the mask.

40:53.587 --> 40:55.881
I mean, I've been working with
the retrovirus for over a month.

40:55.965 --> 40:57.812
If it were contagious,
it won't be airborne.

40:58.756 --> 41:01.260
I knew that, I did.

41:01.936 --> 41:04.052
It's nice of you to come down.

41:04.577 --> 41:07.583
- So, what brings you here?
- Oh... This.

41:08.748 --> 41:10.853
Organic dark chocolate.
I love dark chocolate.

41:11.435 --> 41:13.461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.553
They're saying a week quarantine.

41:17.186 --> 41:19.693
Oh. It's a waste of time, man.
I'm not going to get it.

41:19.787 --> 41:22.642
Let's hope not. But we have
to watch and see what develops.

41:22.917 --> 41:23.892
Okay.

41:24.457 --> 41:26.731
What do you think happened
with that equipment?

41:27.226 --> 41:30.152
- I don't know.
- Wes said it was loose.

41:31.267 --> 41:34.691
No. It's not possible.
Jona checks it at least once a week.

41:38.345 --> 41:40.550
Okay, well...

41:40.968 --> 41:44.350
tell me everything there is
to know about your retrovirus.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.000
Everything.

41:53.318 --> 41:57.060
The widening gap
between the enshrined rules of law

41:57.186 --> 42:00.142
and the evolutionary rules of science

42:00.317 --> 42:02.090
is something that's always bothered me.

42:02.708 --> 42:06.511
I recently read that the teenage brain
isn't even fully formed.

42:06.917 --> 42:10.802
So how are they supposed to
make complex moral decisions?

42:11.916 --> 42:15.151
Owen, you are
a citizen of another country.

42:15.378 --> 42:19.252
And we share with that country
a border that is 5,000 kilometres long.

42:19.398 --> 42:21.940
That's 3,000 miles.

42:22.568 --> 42:24.142
And if you disappear, Owen,

42:24.328 --> 42:28.013
Dr. Sandstrom's important
argument won't be heard in court.

42:28.477 --> 42:33.661
So I have decided that I'm going
to deny your motion of bail,

42:34.098 --> 42:35.972
in order that science

42:36.156 --> 42:38.002
will have its day in court.

42:40.946 --> 42:44.592
You're amended to the custody
of the youth justice services

42:44.835 --> 42:46.543
of this province.
Thank you.

42:47.628 --> 42:49.361
Hang on a sec. Hang on a sec.

42:50.458 --> 42:51.831
Owen...

42:53.527 --> 42:55.003
I'm sorry.

42:55.718 --> 42:56.763
Me too.

42:57.138 --> 42:58.590
I keep seeing her.

43:01.235 --> 43:02.533
That... that...

43:02.945 --> 43:05.352
That stuff you were saying,
about my genes,

43:05.765 --> 43:07.130
can you fix it?

43:07.708 --> 43:09.122
In ten years. Maybe.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.880
Just a second. Just a second.

43:11.698 --> 43:13.770
- That's a fucking long time.
- Yeah.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.943
Well, at least I'm not
a complete fuckup. I mean...

43:18.528 --> 43:21.743
- Some of it was how I was born.
- Sure, and how you were raised and...

43:22.276 --> 43:24.091
And some of it is me.

43:25.157 --> 43:27.821
Whichever part wins is... up to you.

43:29.147 --> 43:30.721
- Yeah.
- And you're not alone.

43:31.135 --> 43:33.153
You need anything, you call me.

43:34.687 --> 43:36.111
Thanks, Doc.

43:36.477 --> 43:37.613
See ya.

44:37.528 --> 44:38.770
What?

44:39.105 --> 44:40.583
<i>David?</i>

44:41.248 --> 44:43.071
Dad. You're all right?

44:43.526 --> 44:46.770
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Where are you?</i>

44:47.055 --> 44:48.650
David...

44:49.728 --> 44:51.950
I got a problem.

45:08.728 --> 45:10.830
<i>Dans le prochain épisode : *</i>

45:10.985 --> 45:13.533
You could have been killed in that fire.

45:13.616 --> 45:18.413
Yes. And for that
one mistake, I will die here.

45:18.747 --> 45:21.520
- Surrounded by ugliness.
- Oh... Jesus.

45:21.685 --> 45:25.150
You don't even know the effects
of GMO foods on the average person.

45:25.296 --> 45:27.670
GMOs are here to stay,
they're the future.

45:27.755 --> 45:29.573
What you're not considering
is that this technology

45:29.707 --> 45:32.401
invariably goes
where it wasn't meant to.

45:32.556 --> 45:36.223
We're like guinea pigs in the
biggest science experiment ever.

45:37.308 --> 45:38.880
Jesus Christ!

45:39.036 --> 45:41.222
You're the head guy on that panel.
Advised the government.

45:41.307 --> 45:44.641
Told them that genetically modified
fish was safe for human consumption.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.252
That's my boy, Dr. Sandstrom.

45:46.436 --> 45:49.063
One day he's running in the yard,
next day his whole body's paralyzed.

45:49.158 --> 45:50.750
Mayko, see if you can dig up

45:50.938 --> 45:53.401
any recent public health
studies of GMO fish, all right?

45:53.537 --> 45:55.953
Why, you think there's
something fishy with the fish?

45:56.245 --> 45:58.573
Basically we've got a group of kids
with muscle development problems.

45:58.825 --> 46:01.820
We're looking into their
family histories, DNA samples.

46:02.057 --> 46:05.210
Bob, are you saying that
something was dumped there?

46:05.626 --> 46:08.231
Well who do we go after? Who are
the biggest shits in the nuclear world?

46:08.407 --> 46:10.931
Russians? Americans?

46:11.217 --> 46:12.253
No...

46:12.868 --> 46:13.961
The French.

46:14.216 --> 46:16.510
- It wasn't an accident.
- Jill, I need you to sign these forms

46:16.556 --> 46:18.330
that NorBAC is not legally responsible.

46:18.556 --> 46:20.403
I'll tell you what, I'll sign
those papers as soon as you start

46:20.535 --> 46:22.952
- doing your job around here.
- And what is that supposed to mean?

46:23.107 --> 46:25.471
That means, figure out
why things are going missing.

46:25.517 --> 46:27.571
Find out who's fucking around
with my lab equipment.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.021
These are troops ramping up for Iraq.

46:30.235 --> 46:32.353
They all came down
with the same symptoms.

46:32.528 --> 46:35.322
Double vision, upper body
weakness, muscle pain.

46:35.515 --> 46:37.743
- They're not responding to any treatment.
- Hey, David.

46:37.945 --> 46:41.943
There's a military plane waiting for you
at Downsview. Get there as soon as possible.

46:42.156 --> 46:43.621
Where am I going?

46:44.167 --> 46:45.561
I can't tell you.

46:48.025 --> 46:49.701
I'm concerned about Jill.

46:49.886 --> 46:51.691
I've asked Wes
to bring you in on this.

46:51.927 --> 46:54.921
You've surprised me in the past,
and it's not too late to join in.

46:55.426 --> 46:57.710
So remember:
only you know the whole story.
