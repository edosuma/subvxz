<i>[man] Un visiteur pour Ie prisonnier

00:53.760 --> 00:56.604
[French accent] Looks like
you made yourself a pretty home in here.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.888
How long are you planning to stay?

01:02.040 --> 01:04.007
You've been here a month now.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.960
No one came for you.
You've had no visitors.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.083
No one even asked for you.
No one wrote you a letter.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.811
Don't you have family? Don't you have
a nice little girl you want to see?

01:17.960 --> 01:20.167
I mean, I can make that happen.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.369
I can put you on a train
back home today.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.682
Just tell me what you know.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.249
Your problem. Have a nice day.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.961
<i>[narrator] They think I'm just a thief.
I prefer the term white collar hooligan.</i>

<i>[man] This is the police. All crowds
should disperse this area immediately.</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:16.485
<i>[narrator] The beautiful game.
Our great nation's number one sport.</i>

03:16.640 --> 03:18.404
<i>Every week,
hundreds of thousands of people</i>

03:18.560 --> 03:20.562
<i>cram their way into these places
to follow their team.</i>

03:20.720 --> 03:24.008
<i>I love it, and if you love it too,
you don't need me to explain.</i>

03:25.200 --> 03:26.361
<i>If you don't know what I mean,</i>

03:26.520 --> 03:29.763
<i>no explanation will ever
make you understand.</i>

03:31.720 --> 03:35.406
<i>Being a part of the crowd, the mob,
gives you a great sense of power,</i>

03:35.560 --> 03:37.483
<i>like animals in a pack.</i>

03:37.640 --> 03:39.324
<i>We're strong because of the group.</i>

03:39.480 --> 03:41.687
<i>We'll always be OK
'cause our mates have got our back.</i>

03:41.840 --> 03:43.524
<i>I fucking love this game,</i>

03:43.680 --> 03:45.842
<i>the skill, the dedication
and the finesse on the pitch,</i>

03:46.000 --> 03:48.890
<i>the awesome power
of the crowd in the stands.</i>

03:49.040 --> 03:52.442
Fucking fruit! Yeah, you!
Yeah, you, you fucking pig cunt!

03:52.600 --> 03:54.204
- Oi, Mike.
- Come on, you fucking mug!

03:54.360 --> 03:56.681
- Dickhead!
- Fucking hell. Oi, Mike!

03:56.840 --> 03:58.729
Ed. Eddie Hill, mate.
What you doing here?

03:58.880 --> 04:02.965
- Same thing as you.
- Hey, fuck you, you cunt, you dickhead!

04:04.120 --> 04:06.805
They're bringing the fucking
tear gas out. You wanna go for a drink?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.530
- The Duke's open.
- Let's go, mate.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.604
Come on, let's fuck off.
Watch out, lads. Go on.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.961
<i>[Mike] A great man once said football
wasn't a matter of life and death.</i>

04:17.120 --> 04:20.726
<i>It was more important than that.
He was right.</i>

04:20.880 --> 04:22.689
- What fucking happened to him?
- Fuck knows.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.525
He's probably an accountant
by the sound of it.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.001
- Oh, shit, mate.
- What?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.766
- Oh. Fuck me. I'm gonna have to go.
- Fuck off.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.810
- I thought we were going for a drink.
- Yeah. It's work, mate.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.325
Not really something I can say no to.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.529
I'll tell you what, let's have
a big one tonight, a proper catch-up.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.648
- D'you know Terry's on Gloucester Road?
- I know it.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.883
Perfect. Freshen up and we'll meet in
a couple of hours. We'll catch up then.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.326
- A couple of hours?
- Two hours.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.403
Two hours. All right, sweet.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.010
Oi! Look at me
when I'm trying to talk to you.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.811
- What you been doing with yourself?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.043
- Oh, shit. Unemployed.
- No, just not many jobs out there.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.486
- Know what I mean, Ed?
- Bollocks.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.120
There's fucking hundreds of jobs around.
Loads of them.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.362
Just nobody wants to do them.
Well, except retards.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.888
Nobody wants to fucking flip burgers
or wipe arses for minimum wage, do they?

05:31.040 --> 05:33.407
- And who can blame them?
- I've been doing a lot of interviews.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.562
Yeah, no, course, mate.
I'm not slagging you off.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.929
I respect you. I think you've got
the right idea. Know your worth

05:39.080 --> 05:40.889
Wait for the right opportunity
to come up.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.089
You know the England manager
position's open? You should go for that

05:44.240 --> 05:45.685
Yeah, very funny.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.606
[laughs]

05:49.760 --> 05:53.367
Give it up, mate.
Nicey Pricey is bad news.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.761
She would chew you up and spit you out.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.442
Actually, mate, I do have a bit of work
on I could throw your way.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.400
Give me a call on this number if
you want a bit of cash for some driving.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.611
I really appreciate that, Ed.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.240
I'm just not looking
to get into anything dodgy right now.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.165
- You know what I mean, mate?
- Nothing dodgy. It's all above board.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.766
Easy money for a bit of driving
I'm trying to throw my mate's way.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.367
Yeah, I bet. With dodgy little packages
in the back seat of the motor.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.488
Mike, that is really harsh.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.928
Ed, you grew up five minutes
away from me, son. Look at you now.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.765
With a whistle, birds wrapped
round you in a place like this.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.402
You're either a drug dealer
or you're in the music industry.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.642
You wanna be a singer?

06:33.800 --> 06:35.370
[whispers]

06:44.360 --> 06:47.728
Mate, I gotta shoot off for a minute.
Let me take care of something.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.805
I'll be back in a bit.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.089
- Handwriting's good.
- What?

07:06.240 --> 07:07.844
Handwriting.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.365
Um...

07:09.520 --> 07:12.091
If you bothered to take a look,
which, I'm not gonna lie to you,

07:12.240 --> 07:14.447
I'm pretty sure you haven't,

07:14.600 --> 07:18.764
you'd notice that I've taken great care

07:18.920 --> 07:22.288
to make everything nice and...
nice and legible.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.121
Full of all the jobs
I've been applying for here.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.568
- Mm-hm.
- And... And not been getting.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.449
It's a competitive market.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.728
Have you considered
going back to university?

07:35.880 --> 07:38.690
- I left university a little while ago.
- Got kicked out?

07:38.840 --> 07:40.649
Well, no. I didn't complete my degree.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.728
Look, I just need something
that's a bit better than minimum wage

07:45.880 --> 07:47.882
that takes half a brain to do,
you know what I mean?

07:48.040 --> 07:50.008
Yes, but we've been sending you
on interviews.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.369
But there's not many jobs around at the
moment and a lot of people out of work.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.522
But do try again in a week or so.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.765
I really am trying, babe. I sent my CV
to those agencies you gave me.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.082
But, to be honest,
I ain't gonna hold my breath.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.288
Well, don't lose hope, OK?

08:04.440 --> 08:07.205
You'll find something
that not only pays well,

08:07.360 --> 08:09.761
that's enjoyable
and that challenges you.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.888
You'll find it soon.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.005
Thank you.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.527
Thank you for making my lunch break
more bearable.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.646
Well, thank you for buying me lunch...

08:22.560 --> 08:26.565
...and maybe renewing my season ticket?

08:33.360 --> 08:37.604
Baby, do you think we should be
a little bit more careful with money?

08:37.760 --> 08:39.602
Just until we're both earning.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.606
I know, football is part of you,
I love you,

08:43.760 --> 08:47.481
ergo I must understand
and love your love of football

08:47.640 --> 08:49.404
even if I don't share it.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.281
Now, I'm not gonna start moaning
about buying you a season ticket.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.920
Just don't let me down, OK?

08:58.480 --> 08:59.720
I won't, I promise.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.730
Safe.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.448
Oh, what, the short slee...?
Don't worry, they'll grow back, mate.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.922
What attracted me most
to working in a ladies clothes shop?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.241
Ladies.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.686
Huh. You all right there? Wanna...

09:27.600 --> 09:29.728
Job like this
must take a lot of restraint.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.281
Yeah, seriously,
you wanna be quiet a little bit?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.966
This is lovely.
This is a bit of me, this, look.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.682
Oh, it's a bit tight, though, innit?

09:40.840 --> 09:43.161
Fucking hell, have I put on weight?
Do I look fat to you, bruv?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.322
Have you got any experience
recording live music?

09:45.480 --> 09:50.361
Not much live music per se,
but I do remember recording the radio,

09:50.520 --> 09:53.683
and it takes a lot of skill to press
stop before the DJ starts talking.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.162
Listen, listen, don't, don't...
I'll do anything, all right?

09:57.320 --> 10:00.244
I'm... I'm a bit fucking desperate,
to be honest.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.449
I like gold, really, 'cause
you should always invest in gold

10:04.600 --> 10:07.410
'cause it's... available.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.485
But I've got a bird
and she obviously wears clothes.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.488
You know. Pretty much makes me
a fucking expert really, doesn't it?

10:17.640 --> 10:19.608
You ever used an MX380 before?

10:19.760 --> 10:22.764
No worries. I should be sweet with that.
I prefer the blackberry, though.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.048
Now, seriously now, yeah?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.921
I'll do cash in hand, all right? Just
under the table, no questions. Yeah?

10:32.280 --> 10:34.203
- Can I have a job?
- No.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.362
All right, can I have a doner and chips?
Hold the salad.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.007
<i>Leave us alone, would you?
What the fuck's all this?</i>

10:41.160 --> 10:43.606
Well, maybe it's time
to just lower your sights a little bit

10:43.760 --> 10:47.162
You've been out of work for a while,
which doesn't look good on your CV.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.369
And not to mention they've stopped
paying your Jobseeker's Allowance.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.602
Mm.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.569
There is one more place I could try.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.131
[whistling]

10:56.280 --> 10:57.361
Hey-

10:57.520 --> 10:59.363
- Sorry I'm late.
- About fucking time.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.885
- Have you seen this?
- What's that?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.246
There's a recession going on

11:02.400 --> 11:04.482
and we're spending 18 million quid
on a centre back.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.369
He's too fucking short.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.524
Here, listen, good things come
in small packages. Don't worry about it.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.445
- Is that what the missus told you?
- Shut up.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.241
Speaking of small packages,
that, my friend, is yours.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.767
It's a fucking hairdryer.
I'm gonna get fucking laughed at.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.570
No, you're not, mate.
Come on, look at it.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.564
It's the embodiment of inconspicuous.
It's great on fuel economy.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.725
It's fully insured
and it is all 100% yours, for work.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.326
Come on, mate. Look at it.
I can totally see you in this car.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.450
- Mikey, the successful hooligan.
- Fuck off.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.331
All right, well, how about this?
New phone.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.165
Brand-new work phone.
New phone, new car, fully insured.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.049
List all the good things
I'm doing for you.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.362
Work phone, work car. Yeah, great.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.602
Not gonna do me much good
getting the shit kicked out of me.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.411
You're not gonna get the shit kicked
out of you. It's not rocket science.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.324
It's easy money for a bit of driving.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.209
All you've gotta do
is take packages I give you

11:53.360 --> 11:54.930
to an address I tell you to go to.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.242
- Bang, you're done.
- And they give me the money?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.767
Y... No.
Nobody said anything about any money.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.082
Look, you just take the package
to the address I give you.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.322
Give me a call.
I'll phone the guys. They'll come down.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.405
They might give you a package back.
Look, it's got nothing to do with drugs.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.166
- Yeah, but it is drugs, though, innit?
- No, it is not drugs.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.324
The sentence for drugs is ridiculous,
which reminds me, mate,

12:14.480 --> 12:17.131
I don't want you drinking or driving
in this car, insured or not.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.442
Keep the tyres fully inflated.
Make sure the lights work.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.806
I don't need you pulled over.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.008
Because you don't want the Old Bill
finding the drugs.

12:23.160 --> 12:27.802
There are no drugs in this fucking car.
I'm telling you. Come on.

12:28.360 --> 12:32.081
I've actually got a date tonight, I've
got somewhere to be, you know that?

12:32.680 --> 12:36.571
Right, this is gonna be
your first assignment.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.530
You take this to that address.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.444
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.763
Do you have a pressing dinner engagement
I don't know about?

12:44.920 --> 12:45.921
No, but I just thought...

12:46.080 --> 12:50.290
That you wouldn't have to do the job
in order to do the job? Come on, mate.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.407
I don't know.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.211
Look, Mikey, if you don't wanna do this,
you don't have to do it.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.850
If the dole money is keeping you happy

12:56.000 --> 12:59.243
and you're just trundling along fine
with Katie, then don't do this.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.041
It's easy money for a bit of driving.
I'm just trying to help a mate out.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.325
Oh, mate, look,
it's not fucking drugs, is it?

13:08.480 --> 13:10.608
It's not drugs.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.643
First week's wages.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.605
- I need the fucking money.
- Good boy.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.650
- And the keys are in the ignition.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.567
Oh, Mikey, that feeling in the pit
of your stomach? That goes away.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.443
Fucking hell.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.366
Great. Fucking delivery service
for PC World.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.641
<i>[voice-mail bleeps]</i>

14:53.800 --> 14:56.724
<i>[Ed] Hello, mate.</i> I <i>bet you looked
inside that box already.</i>

14:56.880 --> 14:58.006
<i>I told you it wasn't drugs.</i>

14:58.160 --> 15:01.209
<i>Listen, the boys are gonna be there
in 15 minutes. Just sit tight.</i>

15:01.360 --> 15:02.327
<i>[bleeps]</i>

15:02.480 --> 15:03.686
<i>[Mike] I was shitting it.</i>

15:03.840 --> 15:06.161
<i>In my head, every car behind me
was undercover police</i>

15:06.320 --> 15:08.800
<i>and every speed limit
a chance to get pulled over.</i>

15:09.640 --> 15:11.483
<i>Eddie said it was all legit.</i>

15:11.640 --> 15:14.007
<i>But if it was,
why the hell weren't we using DHL?</i>

15:15.560 --> 15:18.882
<i>It did cross my mind to call him
and tell him I'd changed my mind.</i>

15:19.040 --> 15:21.725
<i>But the prospect of more job interviews
and queuing up at the dole office</i>

15:21.880 --> 15:23.564
<i>resolved me to stick it out.</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:26.849
<i>After all, money's money.</i>

15:54.680 --> 15:57.411
I <i>soon got into the swing of things</i>

15:57.560 --> 15:59.528
[rap music]

17:08.880 --> 17:11.121
[inaudible]

17:11.280 --> 17:13.281
Speaking of which,
you've been doing good at the job.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.046
- It's a piece of piss.
- I know, but you never ask questions.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.602
Well, you pay me to drive, deliver shit.
It's what I do. It's nothing.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.730
Mike, any idiot can make deliveries.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.009
I think we both know
you're more capable than that.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.529
Mate, I want you to think
of the last few months as a warm-up.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.887
- A trial for the real job.
- Yeah, go on.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.930
How would you like to earn
£1,000 a night?

17:37.240 --> 17:39.322
Ed, man,
what the fuck is it that you do?

17:40.040 --> 17:42.486
Credit cards.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.607
- Credit cards?
- Yeah.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.364
What the fuck do you do
with credit cards?

17:48.520 --> 17:50.443
Use the credit.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.167
You remember about 10 years ago,
banks and businesses,

17:56.320 --> 17:59.210
encouraged by the government,
introduced the chip and PIN system?

17:59.360 --> 18:02.125
Mate, that opened up
the floodgates for us.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.920
You know the chip and PIN pads

18:06.080 --> 18:09.050
the small little things in
petrol stations, shops, bars and clubs,

18:09.200 --> 18:10.440
you enter your number into,

18:10.600 --> 18:14.650
they were sold to the businesses on the
premise that they were 100% tamper proof,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.485
the idea that if somebody tried
to open them up or modify them,

18:17.640 --> 18:18.641
they would just shut down

18:18.800 --> 18:21.610
and more importantly
the customer data would be safe.

18:21.760 --> 18:25.367
What they didn't tell anybody was
that was a lie. It isn't safe.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.602
We found a way
to modify the chip and PIN pad

18:27.760 --> 18:31.207
so that they record the data
without affecting the transaction.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.283
I'm gonna show you how.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.728
We pay somebody
a couple of hundred quid

18:39.880 --> 18:41.882
to swap their machine
for our machine for a few days

18:42.040 --> 18:44.088
whilst it racks up the customer details.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.527
We take those details,
download them onto a server

18:46.680 --> 18:49.843
and then put them
onto clean cards for us to use.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.688
Fucking took you long enough.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.208
And it is completely 100% untraceable.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.806
We end up with thousands
of credit and debit card details

19:03.960 --> 19:05.405
which nobody knows have gone missing

19:05.560 --> 19:07.801
until after we've swiped
one of these magic cards

19:07.960 --> 19:09.041
[Mike] Fucking hell.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.524
[Ed] And the geeks put
all that information onto blank cards.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.841
Yeah, they're all in order, thank you.

19:18.960 --> 19:23.170
The hardware is very interesting, I'm
sure, but this isn't the Dixons. Thanks.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.765
They get a bit possessive.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.002
- Jack, how's it going this week?
- Yep, good, thank you.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.764
All the hardware's in,
software's loaded,

19:28.920 --> 19:31.764
and we're set for the week, I think,
and thank you for the new games console.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.082
That's OK, mate. I didn't pay for it.
Come on.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.082
It always amazes me
that they spend all day on a computer

19:37.240 --> 19:40.210
and then in the evening wanna relax
by playing another computer game.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.083
But that's geeks for you.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.330
- So, mate, what are you thinking?
- What do you do with them?

19:52.480 --> 19:55.802
Oh. Dinner and a movie.
Sometimes a new pair of shoes.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.002
What do you fucking think
we do with them?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.208
- We withdraw cash from them.
- From people's accounts?

20:01.360 --> 20:03.522
Or their credit cards.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.160
Mate, we withdraw whatever the machine
will allow us to withdraw.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.802
Anywhere between
£250 and £300 a night per card.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.450
But then we ditch the card after one use

20:11.600 --> 20:14.171
and then we move onto the next one
and the next one and so on and so on.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.006
- Yeah, it's still theft, mate.
- Mike, we're not mugging people.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.561
We're not stealing from grannies.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.802
We're not walking into a jewellery shop
with a shotgun

20:22.960 --> 20:24.485
giving somebody a fucking heart attack.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.405
The money's all insured. The only people
that lose are the fucking banks.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.087
They're the biggest cunts of all
and you fucking know that.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.402
So how are you supposed
to get rid of this many cards?

20:33.560 --> 20:35.927
It's just you and fucking Dr Spock
as far as I can see.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.529
Mate, it's a big game and we are
a tiny drop in a very large ocean.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.164
Look, mate, when you start with us,
you'll be a runner.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.243
Every team has four runners
and a supervisor.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.050
I'm the supervisor of this team.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.123
Every night you'll take 25 to 30 grand

20:51.280 --> 20:53.248
depending on what the machine
will let you withdraw.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.450
That means I take back 100 to 120 grand
every night for my team of four.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.807
That team of four is multiplied
by another team of four,

20:59.960 --> 21:02.645
so every night
I drop 200 grand to my boss.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.007
- And who's that?
- Don't worry about that for now.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.004
Mate, all you've gotta do
is take 100 cards

21:08.160 --> 21:10.401
and empty a couple of cash machines
every night,

21:10.560 --> 21:13.723
and for that I'm gonna give you
£1,000 a night in cash.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.564
What do you say?

21:16.680 --> 21:18.091
It's money for nothing.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.129
Guys, guys, guys. Shut that off.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.567
- This is Mike. Mike's the new guy.
- What happened to McClurg?

21:22.720 --> 21:26.486
He's with another team now, OK?
Mike stepped up because of the vacancy.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.086
Yeah, but I don't know this guy.
They don't this guy either.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.323
So excuse my paranoia here, mate.
Do us a favour, lift your shirt up.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.926
- You're all right. I don't lift shirts.
- I'm not fucking kidding.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.401
- You need to lift your shirt up.
- Get the fuck off me! You prick.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.562
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Back off, Topbeef.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.722
- Lift up your shirt, for fuck's sake.
- What?

21:41.880 --> 21:43.689
He just wants to see
you're not wearing a wire.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.684
- I'm not wearing a fucking wire!
- Right, so fucking prove it.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.411
Mike, please.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.766
- You happy now?
- Ecs-fucking-tatic. Thank you.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.843
Topbeef, get the cards.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.563
Get the cards.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.725
Come on, ladies, we've got work to do.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.123
These cards aren't gonna fucking do
themselves. Jamie, you're gonna drive.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.408
Dan, stop fucking doing drugs as well.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.961
I can smell it
in this fucking apartment.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.723
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.326
- What?
- What are you doing? I said let's go.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.970
- I'm rolling.
- Oh, you're rolling. OK.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.363
Well, fucking...
Come on, for fuck's sake

22:29.000 --> 22:31.651
- All right, all right.
- What are you looking at?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.323
Goon.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.801
Shouldn't we have a lookout?
We're on a main fucking road here.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.931
You're using a cash machine.
Get on with it. For fuck's sake.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.763
<i>[bleeping]</i>

22:56.760 --> 22:57.966
Fucking hell, it worked!

22:58.120 --> 23:02.444
Don't wave the money around
and don't leave the card in the machine.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.204
Two rules so basic
I failed to mention them

23:04.360 --> 23:06.328
on account of them
being so fucking obvious.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.164
You also don't dance
down the street singing,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.687
"I've just withdrawn a load of money
from a cloned credit card."

23:10.840 --> 23:12.968
- Do you understand?
- I'm just excited, that's all.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.567
You're starting to fucking wind me up,
that's what you're doing.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.166
Listen, you've got 99 cards left to do
and I can't...

23:19.320 --> 23:22.563
- Put the fucking money away.
- All right, all right, all right.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.484
I've got my own machines to do.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.563
Fucking dickhead.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.962
I'll tell you what, though.
I could get fucking used to this.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.841
<i>[Mike] Like any job, what at first
was exciting soon became routine.</i>

23:37.000 --> 23:40.368
<i>The times and places changed,
but the job was always the same</i>

23:40.520 --> 23:42.682
<i>No small talk.
No "Hi. How's it going?"</i>

23:42.840 --> 23:44.649
<i>Just withdraw as much cash as you can.</i>

23:44.800 --> 23:47.246
<i>I was still worried
about getting pinched for it,</i>

23:47.400 --> 23:50.404
<i>but, like Eddie said, it wasn't like we
were mugging old ladies or nothing.</i>

23:50.800 --> 23:53.406
<i>He'd always had a reputation
for finding a scam somewhere.</i>

23:53.560 --> 23:56.325
<i>At school he found where the dinner
ladies threw away the old meal tickets</i>

23:56.480 --> 23:58.926
<i>and then sold them back
to the other kids at half price.</i>

23:59.080 --> 24:01.242
<i>Now he'd found
a different kind of meal ticket.</i>

24:01.400 --> 24:04.324
<i>This was serious money,
and as time went on,</i>

24:04.480 --> 24:07.529
<i>we became better mates than
we'd ever been back in the old days.</i>

24:07.680 --> 24:09.967
<i>He made sure
he looked after his team as well.</i>

24:10.120 --> 24:12.361
<i>Of course, I was always tempted
to skim a I bit off the top,</i>

24:12.520 --> 24:15.410
<i>but I knew I had a good thing going
and I didn't wanna risk it.</i>

24:15.560 --> 24:17.722
<i>Each of us were rinsing
100 cards a night,</i>

24:17.880 --> 24:21.168
<i>each one paying out
between £250 and £300.</i>

24:21.320 --> 24:24.927
<i>That's 25 to 30 grand.</i>

24:25.080 --> 24:28.926
<i>Even on a slack night, a team of four
was bringing back 100 grand,</i>

24:29.080 --> 24:32.050
<i>not to mention the other team
that Eddie had running about elsewhere.</i>

24:32.200 --> 24:35.204
<i>That's 200 grand
he was giving to his boss,</i>

24:35.360 --> 24:37.931
<i>who was also taking the same amount
from another supervisor.</i>

24:38.080 --> 24:39.730
<i>That's 400 grand.</i>

24:39.880 --> 24:41.848
<i>Oh, and there's two bosses,</i>

24:42.000 --> 24:46.085
<i>meaning whoever was at the top
was raking in 800 grand a night,</i>

24:46.240 --> 24:47.765
<i>less wages and running costs.</i>

24:47.920 --> 24:49.922
<i>I could see why Eddie wanted to check
he could trust me</i>

24:50.080 --> 24:51.286
<i>before letting me in on this.</i>

24:51.440 --> 24:54.489
<i>I was handling more cash
then I'd ever seen in my life</i>

24:54.640 --> 24:56.608
<i>and it felt like a victimless crime.</i>

24:56.760 --> 24:59.127
<i>To be honest,</i>
I <i>felt like Robin fucking Hood</i>

24:59.280 --> 25:01.442
<i>After years of the banks
fucking everyone over,</i>

25:01.600 --> 25:03.523
<i>it was our turn to take from them.</i>

25:04.760 --> 25:07.127
<i>The boys were a bit wary
of the new guy at first.</i>

25:08.160 --> 25:10.640
<i>But after I saved them
from getting their collars felt,</i>

25:10.800 --> 25:14.521
<i>I was one of the team and it felt like
we'd been working together for years.</i>

25:15.280 --> 25:17.851
<i>Jamie was all right but a bit slow.</i>

25:18.000 --> 25:20.765
<i>And Dan was far too much of a stoner
for Eddie's liking.</i>

25:20.920 --> 25:23.366
<i>Topbeef seemed to have
a natural dislike for most people,</i>

25:23.520 --> 25:25.090
<i>so was the hardest to win over.</i>

25:26.320 --> 25:28.084
<i>But together we had each other's backs.</i>

25:28.240 --> 25:31.483
<i>After every night's withdrawals, we'd
go out and blow the wages straight away.</i>

25:31.640 --> 25:33.688
<i>Booze and drugs
got us through to the mornings.</i>

25:33.840 --> 25:36.411
<i>At the weekends, if we weren't
kicking the shit out of the opposition,</i>

25:36.560 --> 25:38.847
<i>we'd hire Ferraris on credit
against next week's wages.</i>

25:39.000 --> 25:42.163
<i>I never thought a grand a night
could be spent so quickly.</i>

25:42.320 --> 25:44.049
<i>It was one long fucking party.</i>

25:44.200 --> 25:48.091
<i>I guess the theory was if we kept
drinking, we'd never see the hangover.</i>

25:51.640 --> 25:53.449
- Where have you been?
- Just don't, babe.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.887
- I'm fucking shattered.
- Yeah, me too.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.405
Who are ya? Who are ya?

25:58.600 --> 26:01.410
- Where'd you get this from?
- Babe, what are you fucking doing, eh?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.164
- Where did you get it from?
- It's my wages.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.210
- He pays you in cash?
- Yes, he fucking pays me in cash.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.208
I love you so much.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.488
You've changed since you got that job.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.244
- I'll work for us both.
- I need to be successful.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.561
I have to go.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.729
- You're trying to fucking leave me.
- You've changed since you got that job.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.326
Doing what I'm doing,
I can give you a better life.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.804
Don't worry, mate.
There'll always be another one.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.524
You'll always get another crack
at the whip.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.808
Yeah.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.248
I just knew what she wanted, you know?
I just understood her.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.650
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talking about the score.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.690
1-0. We'll always get another crack
at Millwall.

27:32.840 --> 27:35.446
- You're such a cock.
- Come on, mate. It could be worse.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.126
- Oi, I know you.
- Mate, fuck off, will you?

27:38.280 --> 27:40.681
One of you cunts threw a fucking
glass bottle at my mate last week.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.002
We're having
a fucking conversation here, bruv.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.481
Why don't you do yourself a favour
and fuck off?

27:45.640 --> 27:48.530
Here they come. Oh, great.
We've got Tweedledee, Tweedledum.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.842
Oi. We ain't finished.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.122
<i>[Mike] Eddie was a good mate
as well as a good supervisor.</i>

28:02.280 --> 28:05.011
<i>If you were loyal, he'd look after you.</i>

28:05.160 --> 28:07.288
<i>But you wouldn't wanna get
on his bad side.</i>

28:10.200 --> 28:12.362
<i>- Stealing from banks was no problem.
- Dan.</i>

28:12.520 --> 28:15.888
<i>But once the money was out,
Eddie expected it all to go in the bag.</i>

28:17.320 --> 28:19.243
Come on.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.165
- Are you stealing from me?
- [Mike] Ed, what the fuck you doing?

28:22.320 --> 28:24.926
What the fuck?
Can you believe this shit?

28:25.080 --> 28:28.243
You stealing from us?
Piece of fucking junk.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.881
Fucking stealing?
Fucking stupid fucking cunt.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.085
All right, mate, all right! He's done!

28:35.240 --> 28:37.720
Ed, he's done! He's done, mate!
Fucking hell.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.247
<i>[Mike] It was plain to see
that people shouldn't get too greedy.</i>

28:40.400 --> 28:42.323
Fuck.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.971
<i>Every now and then,
Eddie fancied a change of venue.</i>

28:50.120 --> 28:53.886
<i>We'd do jobs all over the country,
but we also went international.</i>

29:30.480 --> 29:32.801
Boys, good to see you busy.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.486
Fucking hell, boys.
A bottle of wine, double bed.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.405
- A bit suspect, innit?
- Not the only thing that's suspect.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.608
I can smell fucking weed
halfway down the corridor.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.809
What are you trying to do,
draw attention to us?

29:43.960 --> 29:46.486
Topbeef, bag the rest of that up
and we'll go and see the money mover.

29:46.640 --> 29:50.008
In fact, you won't. You're gonna go and
get us tickets for the match tonight.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.685
- Good seats.
- You got it.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.526
Guys, what if somebody from housekeeping
sees all these cards and cash?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.091
No one comes in here, mate, I promise.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.449
Nobody from housekeeping came in.
Look at the fucking state of the place.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.364
We're trying to keep a low profile,
which is...

30:02.520 --> 30:04.045
<i>[phone rings]</i>

30:09.160 --> 30:13.563
Who has this room number? Topbeef,
have you given the number to anyone?

30:13.720 --> 30:15.643
<i>- Fuck off.
- [ringing continues]</i>

30:18.720 --> 30:20.643
Hello?

30:23.200 --> 30:25.009
Have one of you cunts
ordered room service?

30:25.160 --> 30:27.049
- No.
- No.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.931
Have one of you cunts
ordered room service?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.650
- Yes.
- Yes.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.691
And where's room service gonna get
delivered to? Oh, yeah, to your room.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.928
They're not hungry.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.366
Fucking get it together, guys.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.603
Get this place cleaned up. Get your
cards done in two hours when we're back.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.604
- Jamie, don't let him smoke anything.
- I won't.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.684
You're not my fucking parents
I smoke what I fucking want.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.807
I am your fucking dad

30:50.960 --> 30:54.851
I fucked your mum 18 years ago
and now look at the problem I've got

30:56.360 --> 30:58.010
And don't get pinched.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.041
<i>[Mike] You can't just walk
a bag of cash through customs.</i>

31:18.200 --> 31:20.885
<i>On jobs abroad,
Eddie always used a local money mover.</i>

31:21.040 --> 31:22.371
<i>Drop the cash with him,</i>

31:22.520 --> 31:26.923
<i>and his mate back in the UK gives you
the same amount minus his 10% fee.</i>

31:27.080 --> 31:31.165
<i>It may be a little costly, but it was
worth the price to keep things flowing.</i>

31:48.040 --> 31:50.361
- What, you not staying?
- I'm not staying. I'm the supervisor.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.000
I can't stay around watching you
learn to suck cock all my life.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.050
I'm only here for the fucking football,
to be honest. Oh, which reminds me.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.885
If we've got shit tickets, dude,
when I gave you a bunch load of money,

31:59.040 --> 32:01.008
with money-no-object rules
attached to it...

32:01.160 --> 32:03.731
I don't wanna be sitting in a wheelchair
pit or fucking behind a pillar

32:03.880 --> 32:05.166
or right up at the fucking back...

32:05.320 --> 32:07.402
Ed, I've got something
to tell you, mate.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.766
- What?
- I could only get one.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.491
- One what?
- One ticket.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.921
I sent you to a ticket tout.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.287
The geezer you hooked me up with,
he said he can only get one.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.044
He said they were like gold dust.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.886
- You got one ticket to the match?
- Yes. The geezer you set me up with...

32:22.040 --> 32:24.486
- You probably went too late.
- Listen, don't get pissy about it.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.611
- Of course it's gold dust!
- It's not gonna make a ticket appear!

32:28.760 --> 32:30.444
- Are you done?
- Yes, I'm done.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.887
- Can I have my ticket, please?
- Right, and how does that work?

32:33.040 --> 32:36.249
Because I gave you a bunch of money
to get two tickets, you get...

32:36.400 --> 32:38.368
It works because I'm your boss.
Give me the ticket.

32:38.520 --> 32:41.091
Listen, this is fucking football.
It's not work, right?

32:41.240 --> 32:43.481
- Don't pull rank on me.
- I'm not... Right, OK.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.688
- We will flip for it
- What?

32:45.840 --> 32:48.650
We're gonna flip for it.
Flip, flip. Get a coin. We'll flip.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.883
Let me teach you one of life's lessons.
Fate isn't gonna be on your side today.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.804
- Fine. Heads or tails?
- Heads.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.122
- Fuck you!
- Pow!

32:56.280 --> 32:57.770
Now, get me my fucking credit cards.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.882
Bet you wish you were
at that fucking football match.

34:10.040 --> 34:14.170
Would you please fuck off? Don't you
have something better to be doing?

34:14.320 --> 34:16.846
- Been doing it.
- You done already?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.489
Yep. There you go.

34:18.639 --> 34:23.407
- Oh, marvellous.
- And there... are the used ones.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.563
- You'll be wanting some more, then.
- Could do with a beer, I tell you.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.724
- Well, take this lot.
- Fucking hell.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.404
- Look at this. Amateur hour.
- Don't get the fucking hump with me.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.722
I mean it. You can do that with Mike
Don't do that with me.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.645
I'm your fucking supervisor.
Pick up the fucking cards.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.440
When you get back to the hotel, you're
gonna sort out which ones are done.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.683
For fuck's sake. Just run
some interference, for fuck's sake

34:55.840 --> 34:58.286
- All right, boys? What's happening?
- [speak French]

34:58.440 --> 35:01.330
Don't you fucking look lovely
in your little blue suits, eh?

35:01.480 --> 35:03.448
[speak French]

35:03.600 --> 35:06.683
In fact, ask them what the fucking score
is on the football match I should be at.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.241
Do you know
the football score for tonight?

35:09.400 --> 35:11.528
- Eddie, mate, fucking hurry up.
- Five more seconds.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.366
I can't understand a fucking word
you boys are saying, mate.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.841
Don't fucking touch,
you fucking French little ponce.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.525
- I've got it. Go, go.
- Bollocks.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.721
[siren wails]

36:06.000 --> 36:07.923
Fuck.

36:10.040 --> 36:13.647
- That was fucking close.
- That was too fucking close.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.841
- Did you see his face?
- Those fucking gendarmes, mate.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.128
They can fucking move, can't they?

36:28.640 --> 36:32.087
- Fuck. I dropped the fucking bag.
- Forget it, mate. Forget the bag.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.050
I can't forget the bag. It's got a
fucking shit load of cards and cash.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.123
- I'll go and call the boss.
- No, fuck the boss.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.282
We'll go back to the hotel,
pick up some more cards...

36:39.440 --> 36:41.363
Let me make a call.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.603
Fuck. Don't call the boss.

36:45.760 --> 36:46.761
- The key card.
- What?

36:46.920 --> 36:48.410
- The hotel key card.
- I gave it to you.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.803
- I know you did. I put it in the bag.
- Don't tell me you put it in the bag.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.169
I put the card in the fucking bag.
It's in the fucking bag.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.368
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- Fuck.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.931
Jesus fucking Christ.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.641
Call Dan and Jamie
and tell them to get out the hotel.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.610
Tell them to go back to London.
I don't fucking care how.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.130
- Hello, Jamie.
- Get back to London.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.567
Yeah, listen, mate.
It's... It's Topbeef here, son.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.210
We've got a bit of a situation, mate.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.682
Cool, cool. OK.
Police could be on their way, mate.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.808
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Shit.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.483
[loud cheering]

37:28.440 --> 37:32.684
Mike. Call me when you leave the game.
Don't go back to the hotel.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.405
Fuck. Fuck.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.006
- Have you got your passport?
- Yeah.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.164
It's time to fucking get out of here.
Come on, come on. Go.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.770
Police!

38:18.920 --> 38:19.921
Fuck!

38:24.160 --> 38:28.210
<i>And that's how I ended up sentenced
to 18 months in a French prison.</i>

38:31.640 --> 38:33.927
Fuck off! It's the middle of the night!

38:35.160 --> 38:37.083
[man] You have a visitor.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.243
All right.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.643
<i>Cinq minutes.</i>

38:52.680 --> 38:54.648
Hi.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.564
Hi.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.170
- I wasn't expecting to see you
- I bet.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.566
I assume the platinum blondes
haven't visited?

39:05.640 --> 39:08.166
No. No one has.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.321
Eddie came to visit me.

39:13.480 --> 39:17.849
He said they were taking care of you
as much as they could.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.243
Said I shouldn't worry about you.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.965
- Did it help?
- Not really.

39:26.120 --> 39:30.011
At that point I had no idea you were
doing 18 months in a French prison.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.561
I thought you were on holiday
or something, spending your new wealth.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.927
So, yeah, I did get worried.

39:38.080 --> 39:42.449
Yeah, well, don't.
They're sending me stuff.

39:42.600 --> 39:47.925
I'm sure they're keeping you happy with
everything you need to get through this.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.003
But are they gonna look after you
when you get out?

39:50.160 --> 39:53.323
- They have been so far.
- They are the reason you are in here.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.608
You could be out tomorrow
if you just tell the police...

39:55.760 --> 39:57.205
That's not how it works, Katie.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.842
Mike, spare me
the "honour among thieves" bullshit.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.606
At some point
you've gotta put yourself above them.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.491
I just hope when you do,
it's not too late.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.285
For you and for us

40:37.040 --> 40:40.328
<i>[Mike] This had been
the longest six months of my life.</i>

40:46.160 --> 40:48.481
<i>Not helped by regular visits
from the same French copper</i>

40:48.640 --> 40:52.326
<i>asking the same questions
over and over every day.</i>

40:54.040 --> 40:55.963
How did you get the cards?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.043
I've told you a million times.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.207
I bought them off a guy in London.

41:02.360 --> 41:07.400
He was white,
medium height, medium build.

41:08.320 --> 41:11.403
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You told me.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.165
And you're lying.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.368
And you're not even
doing it inventively.

41:16.520 --> 41:20.411
I'm not lying. His name's John Smith.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.881
Why don't you go and look him up
in a fucking phone book?

41:33.280 --> 41:36.284
<i>Turns out they didn't wanna keep me in
for the full stretch.</i>

41:36.440 --> 41:40.411
<i>After six months they fucked me off
back to the London. Result.</i>

42:16.160 --> 42:18.686
You wanna take these things off?

42:18.840 --> 42:21.650
I'm on a fucking train.
I'm not gonna go anywhere, am I?

42:21.800 --> 42:23.564
Until you leave this train in the UK,

42:23.720 --> 42:27.850
you're still my prisoner and you will
wear those handcuffs, okey-doke?

42:28.000 --> 42:31.925
If you wanna eat, do your best.
If you wanna shit, shit in your pants.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.560
Otherwise just shut up.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.688
You French.
Such a friendly fucking nation.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.722
Credit card fraud.
Do a lot of time for that

42:54.880 --> 42:57.929
- Already done my birthday in Paris.
- Who said anything about Paris?

42:58.080 --> 43:00.242
It's the only place
I've committed these crimes.

43:00.400 --> 43:04.564
So unless you've got evidence
to the contrary, you can charge me.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.451
Otherwise I ain't saying another word
until I see a fucking brief.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.405
<i>[voice-mail bleeps]</i>

43:10.560 --> 43:13.245
<i>[Mike] Eddie, my son,
guess who's back in town.</i>

43:13.400 --> 43:15.846
<i>Yeah, I know, takes more
than a French prison to keep me.</i>

43:16.000 --> 43:19.049
<i>They dropped me off at the local nick,
so do me a favour, come by, pick me up.</i>

43:19.200 --> 43:21.931
Fucking prick! What did we tell you?

43:24.440 --> 43:26.522
Shit! You should fucking know!

43:26.680 --> 43:30.082
I told you not to fucking steal.
You fucking did it anyway, huh?

43:30.240 --> 43:33.881
What did you fucking do that for? Huh?
What did you do it for?

43:53.200 --> 43:54.247
Look at him.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.091
Look at him. The man himself.
Well, well, well, well, well.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.571
- Hello, mate.
- How you doing, mate?

44:01.720 --> 44:03.529
- Good holiday?
- <i>Non.</i>

44:03.680 --> 44:06.524
<i>- Ah. Parlez-vous francais now?
- Un peu.</i>

44:07.120 --> 44:10.488
- Man, it's good to see you, mate.
- Good to see you too, Eddie.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.371
- So, much sex inside?
- Your mum popped in for a conjugal.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.010
- You know how it goes.
- Oh!

44:15.160 --> 44:17.731
I was wondering what you were doing
whilst you missed the FA Cup Final.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.928
Fuck you, man. I'm gutted about that.
It kick off?

44:20.080 --> 44:22.128
- Big time. You would have loved it.
- I bet.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.931
Jump in. Somebody wants to say hello.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.526
Oh, by the way, does French cock
taste the same as English?

44:27.680 --> 44:29.603
You'd fucking know, son.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.371
- How's everyone anyway?
- Yeah, good.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.648
Topbeef's running his own teams.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.962
Dan's dead. Jamie's still running.

44:46.120 --> 44:49.169
- Dan's dead?
- Yeah, overdose.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.446
Kind of had it coming.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.321
[man] What the fuck do you mean,
he can't get blood out of a stone?

44:54.480 --> 44:57.086
Who the fuck said you're made of stone?

44:59.400 --> 45:00.367
Right.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.923
OK, I'll catch you later.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.207
This him?

45:10.880 --> 45:14.851
Mr Jacobs. Nice to see you.
Heard a lot about you.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.641
Oh, yeah? Cheers.
So who are you, then?

45:18.800 --> 45:21.724
- Face looks a bit familiar.
- Mike, this is Mr Robinson.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.729
I'm your employer.

45:26.920 --> 45:28.843
What, Scotty Robinson?

45:30.480 --> 45:32.403
You run the firm, mate.
You're a fucking legend.

45:32.560 --> 45:33.925
[laughs]

45:34.080 --> 45:36.845
- It's Mr Robinson.
- Yeah, course.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.963
But, yeah, you're right.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.124
Back in the good old days
I was Scotty Robinson.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.408
The guv'nor, the boss.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.607
[Signs]

45:48.760 --> 45:50.125
But the last time I was away,

45:50.280 --> 45:55.207
I realised that the people
I was doing my bird with

45:55.360 --> 45:57.203
were earning bundles of dough,

45:57.360 --> 46:00.807
not getting their hands dirty
and doing a lot less time than I was.

46:00.960 --> 46:07.525
So when I got out, I decided
to play it smarter, not so hard.

46:09.600 --> 46:15.767
Mind you, anyone fucks with my family,
my business or me,

46:15.920 --> 46:18.810
I revert back to Scotty Robinson
just like that.

46:20.480 --> 46:24.963
But these days I leave the terraces
to the likes of you.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.851
So, what, the bosses report back
to the firm heads now?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.287
- Including me now.
- What, you're a boss?

46:30.440 --> 46:36.447
A vacancy occurred,
and naturally Eddie stepped up.

46:36.600 --> 46:40.764
Mike, we want you to come and work
for us again, this time be a supervisor,

46:40.920 --> 46:43.605
take a step up, run your own team.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.410
Yeah?

46:45.560 --> 46:49.565
It's our way of rewarding you
for your loyalty if you like.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.291
Keeping your gob shut.
Not putting us in it.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.920
- It's more money.
- More responsibility.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.811
- Be just like old times, mate.
- You'll answer directly to Eddie here

46:57.960 --> 47:00.042
What do you say?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.328
Yeah, fuck it, I'm in.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.848
But before you accept,
I've got a little question for you.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.525
Yeah, what's that?

47:07.680 --> 47:12.242
What's your take
on the 1988 FA Cup Final?

47:13.480 --> 47:15.403
It's important.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.049
It's important to me.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.727
To be honest, Mr Robinson,
I was only eight.

47:24.120 --> 47:28.330
Our team went out.
Who else you gonna support?

47:28.480 --> 47:30.369
London club. Wimbledon.

47:30.520 --> 47:33.569
Just wish I was a bit older
to put a bet on. Fuck the Scousers, eh?

47:33.720 --> 47:37.725
Fuck the Scousers, eh?
Fuck the Scousers.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.683
Alex.

47:47.520 --> 47:49.568
That's a good answer.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.801
Take it.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.289
You're gonna need it.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.450
You've become a real target now.

48:01.200 --> 48:05.125
Listen to me. In here, we're all a team.

48:05.280 --> 48:10.446
Outside, different kettle of fish.
Dangerous. Take care.

48:15.400 --> 48:19.803
I wanna ask you something. Why
didn't you come and visit me in jail?

48:19.960 --> 48:23.009
- Mikey, were you feeling unloved?
- I'm fucking serious.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.447
I was there six months.
I didn't hear a fucking thing from you.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.807
I'm not the letter-writing type, babe.

48:27.960 --> 48:32.522
Anyway, I'm here now, aren't I, hmm?

48:37.560 --> 48:40.564
I always knew you'd come back
so we could carry on the party.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.650
<i>[voice-mail bleeps]</i>

48:57.800 --> 48:59.962
<i>[Ed] Mike, I've gotta say, mate,
it's like you never left.</i>

49:00.120 --> 49:02.851
<i>I'm glad you're settling back in.
Listen, the Newcastle lot called me.</i>

49:03.000 --> 49:05.367
<i>They've got a bag full of lovely money,
so get your arse up there.</i>

49:05.520 --> 49:07.363
<i>Give us a buzz when you get back.</i>

49:22.120 --> 49:24.168
Throw us the fucking bag now!

49:24.320 --> 49:26.129
[shouting]

49:27.480 --> 49:28.970
Fuck!

49:34.120 --> 49:35.281
Fucking kill him!

49:35.440 --> 49:36.566
Shit!

49:37.440 --> 49:39.807
Let him have it!

49:52.720 --> 49:55.644
- Come on! We've got the money! Let's go!
- Come on.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.726
We've got money coming in from
Berlin tomorrow, Paris the day after.

50:00.880 --> 50:03.406
The money mover's
charging us 10% at the moment.

50:03.560 --> 50:06.166
- We can drop that to 8% if we...
- [phone buzzes]

50:06.320 --> 50:07.731
I'm sorry. Just one sec.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.206
Mike, how you doing?
Can I call you back?

50:19.480 --> 50:20.970
Slight problem with Mike.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.043
Get him back here now.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.848
Then I pulled out my gun
and tried to shoot him.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.005
Oh. You tried to shoot him?

50:31.720 --> 50:34.690
[Mike] I don't know how to use it.
I'm not a gangster.

50:35.720 --> 50:38.405
I'm a white-collar fraudster
who's been given a gun.

50:39.080 --> 50:41.970
Look, I don't know who they were,
but they were nothing to do with me, OK?

50:42.120 --> 50:45.522
All right. I believe you.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.967
I'm glad.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.726
Whoever robbed you
knew exactly where you were gonna be

50:50.880 --> 50:52.803
and that you were carrying that money.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.564
Not a lot of people knew that.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.724
Yeah. Right.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.689
Don't trust anyone.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.608
This will not happen again.

51:06.520 --> 51:09.285
To get robbed once is unlucky.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.644
To get robbed twice is fucking careless.

51:14.680 --> 51:19.402
So from now on, you will be totally
responsible for every penny you lose.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.847
Got it?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.923
Yeah, I got it.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.285
One more thing.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.368
The big match on Saturday.
Who you got your money on?

51:39.000 --> 51:40.445
United. It's a no-brainer.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.682
Oh, no, not this time.

51:43.560 --> 51:48.441
If I were you, I'd try putting my money
on the underdog.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.166
You might get a pleasant surprise.

51:52.800 --> 51:53.767
Cheers.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.443
Fuck!

52:02.320 --> 52:05.164
- Take it easy, Mike. Take it easy.
- How am I supposed to take it easy?

52:05.320 --> 52:08.483
Look, mate, you just need something
to relax. Here, look.

52:08.640 --> 52:11.803
- Take a little toot on that, OK?
- Fuck, look at me. I'm shaking.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.485
Just make sure it doesn't happen again.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.803
I'm gonna have to now. Otherwise I'm
gonna end up in the fucking Thames!

52:16.960 --> 52:20.646
Mate, just be a bit more alert, OK?
Keep your head down and you'll be fine.

52:20.800 --> 52:24.407
I've gotta get out of here, and I need
to stop doing this fucking shit!

52:24.560 --> 52:27.450
Mike, you can't leave. You leave now,
it looks like you staged the robbery.

52:27.600 --> 52:30.251
- I don't care! I don't fucking care!
- Well, you should care, Mike.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.006
I was fucking shot at today.
Do you understand what that means?

52:33.160 --> 52:37.131
I was fucking shot at! And now
that cunt, he wants to fucking kill me!

52:37.280 --> 52:40.124
I'm gonna fucking go and get what I've
earned, I'm gonna get back with Katie

52:40.280 --> 52:42.328
and go and get the fuck
out of this fucking shit.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.811
I'm over my head, Ed!

52:43.960 --> 52:47.248
You can't leave, Mike.
What did you think was gonna happen?

52:47.400 --> 52:49.004
You think you can just
hand in your notice

52:49.160 --> 52:50.924
and these guys
will give you a reference?

52:51.080 --> 52:52.889
It doesn't work like that, Mike!

52:53.040 --> 52:56.044
Play the long game.
Be a bit smart here, mate

52:56.200 --> 52:59.010
If you're gonna disappear,
you've gotta do it quickly.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.766
And if you're gonna fuck off, you may
as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.924
- I don't know what the fuck that means.
- It means we should wait, Mike.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.367
We should wait until it's worth leaving.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.251
You're not the only person
in over your head, Mike.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.723
Dan didn't die of an overdose.
He got greedy.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.566
[gunshot]

53:35.720 --> 53:38.121
- You fucking killed him!
- I didn't kill him but I saw it happen!

53:38.280 --> 53:40.203
And I couldn't do anything!

53:42.680 --> 53:47.402
Listen to me.
The boss trusts me. He trusts me.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.083
Every week he's getting me to move
larger and larger sums of money.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.561
Every week.
I'm talking two million quid.

53:53.720 --> 53:58.408
Every week I've got two million quid.
Every week, in my hands.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.720
So if you're serious about going,
what I'm saying to you is

54:01.880 --> 54:03.882
let's pick the moment.

54:10.440 --> 54:12.363
We should get back.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.371
Yeah, go on. I'll be all right.

54:24.560 --> 54:26.483
Jesus fucking Christ.

54:29.160 --> 54:33.245
<i>[Ed] Listen, mate, just make sure
you hold fire over what we talked about.</i>

54:33.400 --> 54:36.290
<i>{promised Katie I'd</i> look <i>after you
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do</i>

54:36.440 --> 54:38.522
<i>We just have to pick the right time.</i>

54:38.680 --> 54:42.321
Oh, you fucking dick.

54:47.440 --> 54:49.363
<i>[phone buzzes]</i>

54:53.480 --> 54:55.209
<i>- Hello?
- [man] Hello, mate. You all right?</i>

54:55.360 --> 54:58.284
<i>- Who's that?
- It's your favourite busy copper.</i>

54:58.440 --> 55:00.727
<i>You haven't backed a rotten,
have you?</i>

55:02.960 --> 55:05.611
- Where the <i>fuck</i> are you?
- Never you mind.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.644
<i>What d'you want?</i>

55:08.800 --> 55:11.326
I'm just making sure you ain't spent
all your money on the gee-gees.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.050
I wouldn't want you to run out

55:13.200 --> 55:15.771
I'm not doing anything illegal any more,
so get the fuck off my phone,

55:15.920 --> 55:16.887
stop harassing me.

55:17.920 --> 55:20.844
It's all right, fella.
I'm not harassing you.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.128
I'm just letting you know
that time's running out.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.805
Yeah? How d'you figure that?

55:24.960 --> 55:27.247
Look, if you just want someone
to look after you,

55:27.400 --> 55:29.607
I just wanna let you know,
well, you know, I'm here.

55:29.760 --> 55:32.366
Witness protection?
You out of your fucking mind, mate?

55:33.080 --> 55:35.082
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where I am.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.242
Thanks for the offer.
I'm all right where I am.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.682
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.365
Fuck.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.964
What's up?

55:55.120 --> 55:58.488
What's up is I just sprayed liquid soap
onto my crotch in the bathroom,

55:58.640 --> 56:00.324
so now it looks like
I've spunked myself.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.970
No, I meant with the text.

56:02.120 --> 56:06.921
Uh... It's happening. Robinson wants
to move a whole lot of cash next week.

56:07.080 --> 56:10.562
Wants me to take it to a port up
in Scotland. And I am not gonna do it.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.688
- What?
- This is our chance, mate.

56:12.840 --> 56:14.763
This is our way to get out
Let's fuck off to Rio.

56:14.920 --> 56:17.002
Stash what we can
for the next week and go.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.522
You're fucking mad, mate.
What if we got caught?

56:20.680 --> 56:22.762
If we get caught,
I've got a horrible feeling we find out

56:22.920 --> 56:24.251
what our testicles taste like,

56:24.400 --> 56:26.402
but we're not
because it's just me and it's just you,

56:26.560 --> 56:28.130
nobody to fuck it up for us.

56:28.280 --> 56:31.011
Just get your shit together.
We've got a week.

56:31.160 --> 56:33.686
After the Cup Final tomorrow,
I'll sort everything out.

56:33.840 --> 56:37.481
The Cup Final. That reminds me.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.489
I only managed to get one ticket.

56:41.640 --> 56:43.881
- Fuck off. No, fuck off.
- I know, mate. Genuinely.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.691
- Ticket tout ran out of tickets.
- Yeah, I bet he did, yeah.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.080
I genuinely could only get one.

56:48.240 --> 56:50.163
Mind you, the one ticket
is in the executive box.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.687
I know what you're doing.
This is fucking Paris all over again.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.366
- I could genuinely only get one ticket.
- We'll flip for it.

56:55.520 --> 56:57.522
- We're not flipping for anything.
- We'll flip for it.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.762
Last time you ended six months
inside a Paris jail.

56:59.920 --> 57:03.163
- You wanna do that again?
- No.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.482
- I've got a job for you anyway.
- What's that?

57:05.640 --> 57:08.120
A collection. You've gotta go up north.

57:08.280 --> 57:11.443
Get some credit-card cloning equipment
that Robinson lent a firm up north.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.602
They've held onto it
a week longer than they should.

57:13.760 --> 57:16.331
He's just getting a bit pissy about it.
Just need somebody to get it.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.324
OK, that's fantastic. So while I'm doing
this, you're going to the Cup Final.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.606
That's fucking fair?

57:20.760 --> 57:23.331
Do you wanna be a hooligan all your life
or do you wanna be a winner?

57:23.480 --> 57:24.606
- Yeah, a winner.
- Really?

57:24.760 --> 57:26.842
I'm gonna be a football hooligan,
you loser.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.604
Ooh, important call.
Hold on one second.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.922
Fucking dickhead.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.004
Well, what d'you think?

57:48.400 --> 57:50.368
I don't know
if I can just leave like that.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.963
Baby, please.

57:55.800 --> 57:58.565
I'm trying to get out of this.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.166
And if you're with me,
I think I can do it.

58:04.200 --> 58:08.250
Sorry, Mike.
I think you've gotta do this one alone.

58:18.120 --> 58:20.043
[Nicey Pricey] Hang on!

58:27.160 --> 58:29.640
Fuck me. What, heavy night, was it?

58:29.800 --> 58:32.724
Yeah, something like that.
What time is it?

58:32.880 --> 58:35.360
It's just a bit before midday.
What, did I get you out of bed?

58:35.520 --> 58:37.841
- Yeah.
- Can I come in for a sec?

58:38.000 --> 58:38.967
Um...

58:39.120 --> 58:40.963
Yeah, come in.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.485
So what do I owe
the early morning wake-up call to?

58:49.960 --> 58:51.644
Do you wanna move
to another country with me?

58:51.800 --> 58:53.723
What?

58:54.600 --> 58:56.489
I said do you wanna move
to another country with me?

58:56.640 --> 58:58.051
No.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.330
OK. You're not even
gonna think about it?

59:01.480 --> 59:02.925
I've given it enough consideration.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.844
I don't wanna move
to another country with you

59:05.000 --> 59:06.889
as much as I don't wanna marry you.

59:07.040 --> 59:08.451
"We" are not an "us", Mike.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.491
Yeah, well, I just thought, like.

59:11.640 --> 59:14.007
Look, I don't know what trouble
you're in or soon to be in,

59:14.160 --> 59:15.366
but I don't want a part of it.

59:15.520 --> 59:17.284
I don't want nothing to do with it.

59:17.440 --> 59:20.887
- Yeah. Just in it for good times, then?
- Come on.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.451
Don't act all hurt and surprised.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.489
You knew what I was about
the first time you met me.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.610
You came into this with eyes wide open.

59:27.760 --> 59:29.603
My money and your tits.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.569
Suppose that was the deal.

59:34.240 --> 59:38.245
You know, I don't even know
what I was fucking thinking. I just...

59:38.400 --> 59:40.164
It's just nice to have someone,
you know?

59:40.320 --> 59:44.882
Yeah, I get that,
but that someone ain't me, babe.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.805
Let me ask you something.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.367
What's my name?

59:51.520 --> 59:54.524
- Nicey Pricey.
- What's my real name?

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.001
You just asked someone
you don't know their proper name

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.288
to go and live abroad with 'em.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.445
It's not me you should be asking.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.523
- Well, she said no.
- Course she's gonna say no.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.570
Any girl that actually is in love with
you is gonna make you fight for it.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.881
What do you mean?

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.930
Classy girls cost more
than a Bacardi Breezer, Mike.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.611
So you think I can persuade her?

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.601
Yeah. Well, we had some fun, didn't we?

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.762
We did have some fun times.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.723
We had some very fun times,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.167
and I am gonna miss you.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.961
But... you need to go and talk
to the girl you should be talking to,

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.451
not me.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.523
Goon.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.206
Hey, babe, it's me. Could you give me
a call back when you get this, please?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.283
I was just hoping we could talk.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.442
I've come to realise I don't need
all this in my life. I just need you.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.243
Please call me back.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.645
I love you.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.210
- What?
- What? I'm here for the goods.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.409
- What d'you fucking mean, what?
- Come in.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.925
Make yourself a cup of tea!

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.489
I'm not fucking having this.
You lot are taking the fucking piss.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.642
- Now, where's the fucking gear?
- Shut up, eh?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.007
Why don't you fucking shut up,
all that yapping?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.927
What, you think you're getting it back?
It's my gear now. I need it.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.050
And you can go fuck yourselves
if you think you're getting it back.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.728
- Do you know who you're fucking with?
- I know exactly who I'm fucking with.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.248
You're just a Londoner
who thinks he's a big man

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.084
But let me tell you something.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.242
That equipment is mine

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.043
and the money in all the cash machines
around the country is ours.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.046
And if they want you back, they're gonna
have to pay for you, big time.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.329
So I do hope
you're sweet with your boss.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.403
Chaps.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.083
[Mike yells]

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.368
<i>[Mike] Eddie, it's me.</i>

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.887
<i>These lot want half a million
or they're gonna kill me.</i>

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.168
<i>Just get Robinson to pay, all right?
Please.</i>

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.243
<i>[man] That's enough!</i>

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.843
I want these out of here now.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.651
I've got a big function here tonight,
don't want them around.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.767
Sure.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.811
When you get to the docks, you'll be
phoned by a man called Gerrard.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.682
He'll tell you where to meet him.
When you've made the drop, call me.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.043
Something else?

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.962
Scotty... Mr Robinson.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.961
It's been nearly a week.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.645
I just wondered if we were gonna
try and get Mike back.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.160
I don't pay ransoms,

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.449
'cause if I did, you'd all be far more
vulnerable then you already are.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.284
Now, you wouldn't want that, would you?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.681
No, course not.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.287
But I'll get our kit back,
promise you that,

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.967
and I'll make them soppy fuckers that
took it regret ever messing with us.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.248
I just, you know,
I thought we were part of a team

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.488
Now, don't be a silly boy.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.289
You'll be telling me next
that there's no "I" in T-E-A-M.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.363
He's gone. Got it?

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.284
Right.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.171
Now, please get this stuff out of here.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:03.283
Fuck me? No, fuck you. Fuck you.
I'll tell... I'll fucking kill him.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.046
Now, you tell me, what is with
your fucking cheap-arse crew, eh?

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.009
I fucking told 'em I've got ya

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.288
and if they want you back
they're gonna have to pay.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.126
Do you know what they said?
Keep him. Fucking keep him.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.010
I mean,
what kind of fucked-up shit is that?

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.763
Your muggy little pals
had better pay up.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.571
Otherwise I'm gonna
chop you to bits, my son.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.088
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.607
You fucking bastard!

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.364
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.851
Shut your fucking face.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.570
Shut your fucking face up.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.764
You fucking...

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.043
Sorry, Mike.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.690
Fucking cunts. Fucking cunts!

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.888
You work for fucking cunts

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.726
who are not willing to pay
a decent ransom like normal people.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.965
I mean, why send us you?

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.203
Why not send us someone
they fucking liked?

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.124
As it is, you're useless...

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.410
...worthless, and there's no need
for you to be here any more.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.881
It's time to get rid of you.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.683
[screams]

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.528
Now, you're lucky
you're still breathing.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.368
[heart beats]

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.124
<i>[man, indistinct]</i>

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.122
<i>Get this ambulance prepped
and ready for operation.</i>

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.930
<i>[man 2] ...do say
will be given in evidence.</i>

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.002
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.167
Listen, you can hardly go back
to Robinson now, can you, eh?

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:30.120
He knows you were fucking in bed with
Eddie. He ain't fucking stupid, fella.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.044
What happened with all that money, eh?
What did Eddie do with it?

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.408
'Cause he didn't fucking help you out,
did he? Didn't get you out of there.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.645
No. That must have felt
a right kick in the bollocks, eh?

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.689
I mean, it's not exactly loyal, is it?

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.680
- No comment.
- What do you want me to do, eh?

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.446
You want me to fucking
drive you back there, drop you off?

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.444
Is that what you want? I'll fucking
do it. I ain't got a problem with that.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.640
- No comment.
- Listen, don't be a cunt, all right?

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.881
There is no fucking point
in you keeping your mouth shut.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.962
I know it all, all right?

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.531
You got two options.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.761
You either go back there
and I'll give you 24 hours

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.729
and you'll be fucking dead,
do you hear me?

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.920
Or you nark him up, I'll put you on
a witness protection, give you a new ID

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.323
I'll ship you out somewhere fucking
miles away and you can live your life.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:24.562
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.240
Listen, I know what I'd fucking do.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.562
No comment.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.721
You think I'm winding you up, don't you?

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.729
<i>[shouting on tape]</i>

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.962
<i>[Ed] Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Back off, Topbeef.</i>

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.009
<i>- Lift up your shirt, for fuck's sake.
- [Mike] What?</i>

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.924
<i>[Ed] He just wants to see
you're not wearing a wire.</i>

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.606
<i>- I'm not wearing a fucking wire!
- [Ed] Right, so lift your shirt up now.</i>

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.727
<i>Mike, please.</i>

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.803
That's Eddie.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.680
Detective Church, d'you wanna come in,
come and say hello?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.768
I bet you didn't see this one coming,
did ya?

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.650
Oh, Mike.
Look at the fucking state of you, mate.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.408
Don't tell me.
You fell down some stairs.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.369
Now, seriously, though, Mike,
I think you're all right.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.003
Which is why what I'm about to say
to you comes not as a police officer

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.322
but someone that wants to help you.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.769
So why don't you do yourself a solid,
take witness protection and testify?

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.571
It's the only way
you're gonna see 30, mate.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.927
Now, I've got a strong case,
ready to go,

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.890
but your testimony
will make it watertight

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.886
Everyone'll go down. There'll be
no one left to come after you.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.371
And by the time they do finally get out,
you would have been a different person,

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.488
living in a different place, for years.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.683
And this is the best and only option
you're gonna get, mate.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.568
[Church] We've got some good news
and some bad news.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.768
The good news is
we've got dozens of runners,

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.924
a load of supervisors
and several bosses.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.845
The important thing
with your testimony

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.163
they'll all go down
for a very, very long time.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.290
Unfortunately, though, we couldn't get
the people right at the top.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.603
Some of the top boys have disappeared.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.649
What?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.565
So I've gotta spend the rest of my life
looking over my fucking shoulder now?

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.724
No, don't you worry about that.
We'll sort that out now.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.609
Yeah, well, you fucking better had.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.609
Well, you're gonna go with my colleague

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.161
and he's gonna take you
to a safe house.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.245
You're gonna wait there
until we sort a few things out.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.324
Then you're gonna get relocated.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.403
All right.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.567
I need to go somewhere first, OK?

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.007
God, l fucking love this place.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.488
You win some... you lose some.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.168
No, mate.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.324
It's not about the winning and losing.
It's all about the fight.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.801
So where did it all go wrong?

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.203
When I stopped being a hooligan.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.163
Fucking Eddie.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.888
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.203
I'll be sure to tell him that
if I ever see him again.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.730
Your new identity's a national secret.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.771
Even regular police and passport control
don't know the difference.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.640
You can go anywhere you want now, Mike.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.649
Just so long as it's not round here.
So where do you wanna go, then?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.001

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.924
<i>Mike, it's Eddie.</i>

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.809
<i>Listen, mate, I'm sorry I had to bail.</i>

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.167
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't get you
out of there, but, look,</i>

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.926
<i>if you're hearing this message, I think
you know where I want you to go.</i>

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.084
<i>The code hasn't changed,
nor has my intention to look after you.</i>

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.651
<i>Just do me a favour, will you?</i>

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.690
<i>If you get out of this,
stay in during Cup Finals, will you?</i>

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.763
<i>[bleeps]</i>

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.811
Hi.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.564
- Got what you needed?
- Yep. Just the essentials.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.607
- <i>Vous avez fini?</i>
- <i>Our', merci.</i>

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.364
Cash or card?

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.603
