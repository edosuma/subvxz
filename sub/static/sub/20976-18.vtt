WEBVTT

00:06.433 --> 00:07.767
- Oh, whoa.

00:07.767 --> 00:11.133
- I was missing my whole lip,
from the middle to the edge.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.033
It's really hard.

00:13.033 --> 00:15.433
It's like, I don't want to look
like this the rest of my life.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.533
I don't.

00:16.533 --> 00:17.533
- We have a gift for you guys.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.166
Isn't that great?

00:19.166 --> 00:20.166
- Hold on, can I see it
for a minute?

00:20.166 --> 00:21.433
Here we go.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.166
- Oh, my god.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.166
- Is it weird that I think
my wife's breasts

00:24.166 --> 00:25.533
look good on Dr. Dubrow?

00:25.533 --> 00:28.266
- This is clearly fatty tissue.

00:28.266 --> 00:30.033
I've never seen this.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.000
- I don't want to be teased
or talked about,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
or the butt
of anybody's jokes.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.433
The butt.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.600
- ♪ I wanna be sexy ♪

00:40.600 --> 00:43.200
♪ I wanna be hot ♪

00:43.200 --> 00:48.033
♪ Fix me,
make me beautiful ♪

00:48.033 --> 00:50.300
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

00:50.300 --> 00:51.300
- My name is Allegra.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.467
I'm 47 years old,

00:52.467 --> 00:54.066
and my boobs are bipolar.

00:54.066 --> 00:55.600
I've got the good girl,

00:55.600 --> 00:57.600
and then the diva who doesn't
want to do a damn thing.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.033
I naturally have
a dual-sided personality.

01:01.033 --> 01:03.066
I am a sensual woman,

01:03.066 --> 01:06.166
and I just love
the extreme aesthetic.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.333
But I'm also a prodigy
on the piano.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.567
And when I was
about 6 years old,

01:12.567 --> 01:14.433
I started studying
at Brigham Young University

01:14.433 --> 01:17.333
with a professor there.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.233
My life has always been
a dichotomy.

01:20.233 --> 01:23.200
I'm the freak of nature,
willing to try anything,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.500
but I'm also a wife
and a mother and a homemaker,

01:25.500 --> 01:27.467
and I love my family.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.100
My husband now, Dyson,
always fantasized

01:30.100 --> 01:32.600
about having a wife
who had huge breasts.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.233
He loved Pamela Anderson,
had a huge crush on her.

01:35.233 --> 01:39.100
So at the age of 33,
I got my first breast implants,

01:39.100 --> 01:41.100
and they were 800 cc.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.633
People would notice,
"Oh, you have nice breasts.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.467
They're full, they're lovely."

01:44.467 --> 01:46.600
But I was getting
that boob greed a little bit.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.633
Wanted to be fuller, bigger.

01:48.633 --> 01:52.367
And I found a website where it
would bring men that wanted

01:52.367 --> 01:55.100
to financially support women
that wanted implants.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.066
And they would buy picture sets,

01:57.066 --> 01:59.600
request certain things
for a certain dollar amount.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.533
And the site would cut
the check to the doctor,

02:02.533 --> 02:04.500
and you would just go
and get implants.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.500
The doctor said he would
comfortably put in 1,700.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.667
When I got the second surgery
and I woke up from that,

02:10.667 --> 02:13.400
I felt like an elephant
was on my chest.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.633
And I--I'm getting giddy
talking about it now.

02:16.633 --> 02:20.266
I loved it, but it still wasn't
as big as I wanted to be.

02:20.266 --> 02:24.400
So I found out about a doctor
that did tissue expanders,

02:24.400 --> 02:28.400
where I could expand with saline
and grow my implants.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.500
I love being in control,

02:31.500 --> 02:34.266
and I love being in control
of my own breast size.

02:34.266 --> 02:37.266
I was able to double the size
to 4,000 cc

02:37.266 --> 02:39.133
in about five months.

02:39.133 --> 02:41.667
I am at 4,600 cc.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.700
I definitely use the gym
to strengthen my back

02:43.700 --> 02:45.533
and keep my core strong

02:45.533 --> 02:47.433
so that I can
hold these girls up.

02:47.433 --> 02:51.500
I actually have 20-plus pounds
of weight vest on,

02:51.500 --> 02:54.533
but it's the cutest weight vest
you've ever worn, I promise.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.533
After the expanders
were put in,

02:56.533 --> 02:59.266
I did notice that my left side
sat a little bit higher

02:59.266 --> 03:00.700
and was firmer.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.700
The more that I increased
the size,

03:02.700 --> 03:04.667
the more it became apparent.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.300
So what I would love

03:06.300 --> 03:08.266
for the doctors
to be able to do

03:08.266 --> 03:10.166
is fix the asymmetry.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.533
I'll be the poster child
of extreme surgery,

03:12.533 --> 03:15.033
but still wear it well.

03:15.033 --> 03:17.633
And that has been my whole
mission all along anyway.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.300
- Come in, my brother.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.467
- Whoa.

03:28.467 --> 03:31.333
- It's been four months
since I showed Terry my space.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.567
And at that time, we were just
in the middle of construction.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.333
Now I want to show him
where we're at,

03:35.333 --> 03:37.433
plus I want to make him
a little jealous.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.600
- Wow, this is nice.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.700
- Then, of course, look at that.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.467
- Wow, "Nassifmd."

03:42.467 --> 03:44.734
Is Dr. "Nassifmd" here?

03:44.734 --> 03:46.700
By the way,
how big of a pain is he?

03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
Huge, right?

03:47.700 --> 03:48.734
Scale of one to ten?

03:48.734 --> 03:50.333
Nine?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.600
She said yes.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.200
- Now look at this, LED bed.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.533
- Whoa.
- Boom!

03:57.533 --> 03:59.200
- Paul flips a switch,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.200
and it's like
the Pink Light District.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.567
I only call it that
because Red Light would imply

04:03.567 --> 04:05.734
that people would actually pay
to have sex with him.

04:05.734 --> 04:07.600
- This releases nitric oxide.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.734
- Yeah, increase oxygen flow
to your tissues.

04:09.734 --> 04:11.767
- And also to your
zebit, especially.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.767
- Oh, is that
why you bought this?

04:13.767 --> 04:15.767
You don't want to lay
in there for a few minutes

04:15.767 --> 04:18.233
before you go out tonight?

04:18.233 --> 04:20.233
Wow, it's beautiful.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.600
It's like someone's home.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.633
- Then here is where
the magic happens.

04:23.633 --> 04:25.467
- Wow!

04:25.467 --> 04:27.467
Quite a difference.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.300
This is comfortable, huh?

04:30.734 --> 04:32.500
- No.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.633
I'll bet you Paul's luck
with women

04:34.633 --> 04:36.633
would improve significantly

04:36.633 --> 04:39.200
if he just sold his house
and moved into his office.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.767
It's like the ultimate
surgical bachelor pad.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.367
This is the nicest
I've ever seen.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.734
You did a great job.

04:44.734 --> 04:46.333
Way to go, huh?

04:46.333 --> 04:47.734
Way to go.

04:49.533 --> 04:50.533
- My name is Karissa.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.400
I'm 25 years old.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.667
And a dog ate a lot more
than just my homework.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.633
I come from a three-mile town,
Bayonne, New Jersey.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.633
I went to an all-girls
Catholic high school.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.667
I would always talk so much,
that I'd get in trouble.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.333
Other than that,
I was a good student.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.767
I got pretty good grades.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.000
You could say
I was life of the party.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.266
I'm not trying to brag,

05:06.266 --> 05:07.633
but I'd light up the room.

05:07.633 --> 05:09.000
I'd literally
make everyone laugh.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.500
And then a year ago,

05:10.500 --> 05:11.767
my life changed completely
for the worst.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.367
We went to a friend's house,

05:13.367 --> 05:14.533
and we started
playing card games,

05:14.533 --> 05:15.767
just hanging out.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.633
I was playing with the dog.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.400
Sitting on the floor,
I was about to pick up my phone.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.233
And the last thing I remember

05:21.233 --> 05:22.667
is my friend running up to me
with a towel,

05:22.667 --> 05:24.400
holding it on my face,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.266
and then everyone was just
going in a panic.

05:26.266 --> 05:27.667
And I looked down,
and I was drenched in maroon.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.367
It all blacked out.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.567
Then I remember waking up
in the ER.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.300
I felt my face really heavy,

05:32.300 --> 05:33.433
and I'm like,
something's not right.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.266
And they were like,

05:35.266 --> 05:36.533
"You're not allowed
to go to the bathroom."

05:36.533 --> 05:38.266
And I'm like,
I'm 25 years old.

05:38.266 --> 05:39.667
If I have to get up
to go to the bathroom,

05:39.667 --> 05:40.700
I'm going to the bathroom.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.700
I was washing my hands.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.000
I look up.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.033
I'm covered from here to here,

05:44.033 --> 05:45.567
just all white.

05:45.567 --> 05:47.633
I unraveled it,
and guess what I saw.

05:47.633 --> 05:50.300
I was missing my whole lip
from the middle to the end.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.567
I just broke down.

05:51.567 --> 05:52.700
I sat on the floor,
and I just cried.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.567
I just couldn't believe what--

05:54.567 --> 05:56.433
I still didn't know
what was happening.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.033
I thought I was in a dream.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.567
I remember my mom and my dad
coming in.

06:00.567 --> 06:01.667
They opened the curtain.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.000
My dad started crying.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.433
He's like, "I can't do this."

06:04.433 --> 06:06.400
I just remember
the nurse saying,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.000
"All right, we're gonna prep you
for surgery; let's go."

06:08.000 --> 06:09.633
Later on when I woke up,

06:09.633 --> 06:11.533
I found out they were
trying to reattach

06:11.533 --> 06:12.700
the piece of the lip
that was taken off,

06:12.700 --> 06:14.333
but the skin was so damaged

06:14.333 --> 06:16.300
that they couldn't reconnect it.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.066
So that's when he decided
to curve my bottom lip

06:18.066 --> 06:19.700
up to my upper lip.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.734
Six months later,
I had my second surgery.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.467
I looked in the mirror,
and I looked the same to me.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.333
Everyone saw a difference,
but I didn't.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.433
I don't care
what other people see.

06:26.433 --> 06:27.567
I need to see it.

06:27.567 --> 06:28.700
So when I went to my surgeon,

06:28.700 --> 06:30.600
I told him, I was like,

06:30.600 --> 06:32.567
"I really want to be able
to open my mouth."

06:32.567 --> 06:33.700
And he's like, "I don't feel
like it'll be able to open

06:33.700 --> 06:35.567
any more than it already is."

06:35.567 --> 06:37.066
That's when I started Googling
top plastic surgeons.

06:37.066 --> 06:38.300
I clicked Dr. Nassif's name,

06:38.300 --> 06:39.734
and I see a little clip

06:39.734 --> 06:41.333
regarding why he went
into plastic surgery,

06:41.333 --> 06:42.700
than when he was in residency,

06:42.700 --> 06:44.700
a 6-year-old boy came in
with multiple dog bites,

06:44.700 --> 06:46.567
and that's what made him really
want to go into plastic surgery.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.467
And I was like, wow,

06:48.467 --> 06:50.467
if anyone really could help me
and would want to help me,

06:50.467 --> 06:53.367
I feel like it would be
Dr. Nassif.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.600
- At least you're
coming out to eat.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.734
- Like I frigging need to.

06:55.734 --> 06:57.500
I'd rather actually pet a dog

06:57.500 --> 06:58.734
than eat at a restaurant,
to be honest with you.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.066
I don't like being stared at.

07:00.066 --> 07:01.600
What are you
gonna get to eat?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.433
- A burger,
we're at a burger spot.

07:03.433 --> 07:04.467
I'll cut it up for you
if you need me to cut it up.

07:05.734 --> 07:07.100
To eat a burger,
you have to actually

07:07.100 --> 07:09.100
pick it up and bite into it.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.100
And in my case, anything that
requires me to open my mouth,

07:10.100 --> 07:12.066
I honestly can't.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.633
All my foods that I love
to eat, I have to cut.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.367
So when I'm sitting there
cutting it,

07:15.367 --> 07:16.600
I just feel like everyone
is staring at me.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.767
I feel like it was
just yesterday.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.600
- Yeah.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.600
- In the beginning,
when it first happened,

07:21.600 --> 07:22.633
I really didn't think you were
gonna leave the house at all.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.633
- I didn't plan on it.

07:24.633 --> 07:26.367
- Well, you used to be all about
make-up and doing your hair.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.100
- I used to; now I just
work a bun like this.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.500
I don't care anymore.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.767
If Dr. Nassif could help me,

07:30.767 --> 07:32.333
I want to be able
to eat normal.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.600
I want to be able
to wear lipstick.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.367
It's probably gonna sound crazy,

07:36.367 --> 07:37.767
but the main thing
I really want to do

07:37.767 --> 07:39.533
is take a nice bite
out of a juicy hamburger.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.100
And if I can wear lipstick
doing it,

07:41.100 --> 07:42.667
that would make it even better.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.367
- What if they say that they
can't do anything?

07:44.367 --> 07:46.000
- I'll be devastated,
are you kidding me?

07:48.667 --> 07:49.767
- What kind of a structure
is that?

07:49.767 --> 07:51.000
Can it be moved?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.133
- To be honest with you,

07:52.133 --> 07:54.000
I've never seen that either.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.467
If there was ever a case
that needed our attention,

07:56.467 --> 07:59.133
this is the one.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.633
- These are heavy.

08:00.633 --> 08:04.066
- Oh, my god,
my boobs are huge.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.367
- Wow, I can hear
the ocean in here.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.133
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

08:13.133 --> 08:14.400
- My name is Sharon.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.767
I'm from Jesup, Georgia.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.567
I was born with a tumor
on my lower back.

08:18.567 --> 08:21.700
Doctors then explained
that I had spina bifida.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.033
They removed the tumor,

08:23.033 --> 08:25.000
and as a result of the surgery,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.567
my backside,
it started to grow up.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.166
I always knew there was
a difference in my backside,

08:30.166 --> 08:32.000
because I have an older sister,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.567
so I could see
what hers looked like,

08:33.567 --> 08:35.300
and I knew mine
didn't look like that.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.533
Seeing my sister be able

08:37.533 --> 08:39.700
to wear certain outfits
that I couldn't wear,

08:39.700 --> 08:43.033
it just made me feel
like I didn't fit in.

08:43.033 --> 08:44.667
And I'm from the South.

08:44.667 --> 08:49.567
I like the Southern
big butt look.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.400
My family in general
didn't talk about it,

08:51.400 --> 08:53.033
because if it's talked about,

08:53.033 --> 08:56.567
then it would be out there
that you're different.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.700
I started to wear bigger shirts
and bigger pants.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.200
I remember there was
a pool party

09:01.200 --> 09:02.600
that I was invited to,

09:02.600 --> 09:03.734
and I wanted to go,

09:03.734 --> 09:06.066
but I was fearful.

09:06.066 --> 09:08.600
I may be exposed
and have to answer questions

09:08.600 --> 09:10.066
about, "What's that?"

09:10.066 --> 09:11.734
and, "Why does it look
like that?"

09:11.734 --> 09:14.433
So I said, no,
that I couldn't go.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.734
It's a fear of mine

09:15.734 --> 09:17.467
for people
to think I'm different.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.066
I don't want to be teased
or talked about

09:19.066 --> 09:21.333
or the butt of anybody's joke.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.734
The butt.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.066
I feel like I've been
carrying this burden by myself,

09:27.066 --> 09:30.066
because most people,
they have situations

09:30.066 --> 09:32.734
they can talk to someone about
that understands,

09:32.734 --> 09:34.734
but I don't have anybody
to talk to.

09:34.734 --> 09:39.600
I don't know anybody else with
my condition or my situation.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.700
It's sad.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.233
Being intimate
has been difficult.

09:48.233 --> 09:50.600
I had certain positions
I would lay in.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.734
I wouldn't let him touch me
a certain type of way.

09:53.734 --> 09:55.367
I don't want to look this way.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.100
So why should somebody

09:57.100 --> 09:58.767
want to be with somebody
that looks that way?

09:58.767 --> 10:00.633
I am so sick and tired of it.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.200
I'm ready to get it
out my life,

10:02.200 --> 10:04.033
and I'm ready.

10:07.467 --> 10:10.367
- So our first patient this
morning has a dog bite injury

10:10.367 --> 10:11.767
to the upper lip.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.500
So let's go look
at some photos.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.767
- Cute girl.
- So here she is pre-.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.200
- Oh, whoa.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.100
- Okay, so she had
an Abbe flap.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.500
- That's a big chunk
taken out, wow.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.266
- Almost half
of the whole upper lip gone.

10:22.266 --> 10:26.266
- Important anatomic features
have been removed.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.667
- Can you please
send in Karissa?

10:28.667 --> 10:30.667
- Nice to meet you.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.000
- Hi, Karissa, Terry Dubrow,
pleasure to meet you.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.100
- Pleasure to meet you.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.667
- Hi, I'm Lanie, I'm the friend.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.533
- Yeah.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.667
- I'm a good friend.
- Good friend.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.667
- Over the past year,
I've watched Karissa

10:41.667 --> 10:43.633
go through ups and downs.

10:43.633 --> 10:45.734
If Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
could fix her,

10:45.734 --> 10:47.767
she's gonna be back
to where she left off.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.000
- Can you tell us a little bit
about what happened?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.133
- A year ago this month,
I went to my friend's house.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.667
We were playing with the dog,
hanging out.

10:54.667 --> 10:55.667
- It was a mixed dog.

10:55.667 --> 10:56.734
I don't know if it was--

10:56.734 --> 10:57.767
- We don't really know.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.266
- Yeah, she was
actually with me.

11:00.266 --> 11:02.133
- Yes.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.667
- I just remember picking up
something from the floor,

11:03.667 --> 11:05.166
and then I remember
just being in the ER.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.166
- Yeah.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.300
- I don't remember anything.

11:08.567 --> 11:09.700
- Yeah, I was in the bathroom

11:09.700 --> 11:11.533
when the bite
actually happened.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.033
So I go out there,
and my friend's face is missing.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.033
So I started flipping out,
like, "Call 911."

11:15.033 --> 11:17.433
Ambulance came, they gave me
the part of her face,

11:17.433 --> 11:19.433
put it on ice
in the ambulance.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.166
- She didn't pass out,
but she was in shock.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.033
- It's not uncommon
for a patient to black out

11:26.033 --> 11:28.166
during a traumatic incident.

11:28.166 --> 11:32.266
It's kind of the brain's way
of protecting itself.

11:32.266 --> 11:35.533
- So then at that point,
you went to the emergency room.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.433
And did they take
the piece of lip?

11:37.433 --> 11:39.166
- Yeah, I gave it
to a nurse.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.166
- And what happened,
did they try to put that back?

11:41.166 --> 11:43.266
- They had it on ice, and
a surgeon tried to replace it,

11:43.266 --> 11:45.300
but there was so much
tissue damage and nerve damage

11:45.300 --> 11:47.066
that he couldn't connect it.

11:47.066 --> 11:48.200
- So he tried putting
the piece together.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.700
- Yeah, it was dead tissue.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.200
- So you know
he put a flap here.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.333
- Yeah.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.066
- So what they did was,

11:54.066 --> 11:55.567
they took a piece
of your lower lip

11:55.567 --> 11:57.200
and kind of rolled it up
to fill that defect.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.200
Before doing an aggressive
procedure like that,

11:59.200 --> 12:01.033
we would have maybe just
put the tissue together

12:01.033 --> 12:02.166
and see how it heals,

12:02.166 --> 12:03.467
because it does shorten,

12:03.467 --> 12:04.467
obviously,
the sides of your mouth.

12:04.467 --> 12:05.600
- Yeah.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.200
- That's really a shame.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.700
There's a good chance
that Karissa's mouth

12:08.700 --> 12:10.200
could have looked a lot better

12:10.200 --> 12:11.600
if the doctors used
original tissue.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.734
- She goes to doctors
all the time,

12:12.734 --> 12:14.200
and they can't do anything.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.734
- Is that what you've
been told?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.600
- You'se are literally
the last two for her.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.734
- It's just really hard.

12:18.734 --> 12:20.700
It's like...

12:20.700 --> 12:23.600
I don't want to look like this
the rest of my life, I don't.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.734
I can't really even begin
to express how I feel,

12:25.734 --> 12:29.066
because it's just been
a very long journey for me.

12:29.066 --> 12:30.367
- I think the next thing
that we need to do

12:30.367 --> 12:31.500
is go straight
to the exam room.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.100
- Okay.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
- At this point,
I really don't know

12:34.600 --> 12:36.633
if I'm gonna be able
to help Karissa.

12:36.633 --> 12:39.734
I just hope that her doctor
has done irreversible damage.

12:39.734 --> 12:43.100
- Show me your teeth.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.767
- Okay, I'm gonna do something.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.066
So this is sharp.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.100
- Yes.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.333
- Okay, and this is dull.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.767
Close your eyes.

12:51.767 --> 12:53.233
Tell me if this
is sharp or dull.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.600
- Sharp, sharp, sharp.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.100
Dull, dull.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.200
- That's good.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.734
- Yeah, that means that your
sensation of the nerve is good.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.367
Obviously, that tissue is gone.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.100
And the best way to do things

13:05.100 --> 13:07.500
is to take tissue from
another area and move it over.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.000
And there's different ways
to do that.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.266
The simpler thing
to do first is,

13:11.266 --> 13:13.633
we make a cut
along where that tissue is,

13:13.633 --> 13:16.000
and we lift it up
and go into your mouth.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.633
And we try to see if we
can pull it out a good amount.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.400
- Mm-hmm.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.667
- The first option,
which is a little bit easier,

13:22.667 --> 13:24.367
is a commissuroplasty,

13:24.367 --> 13:26.133
where you're actually
removing scar tissue

13:26.133 --> 13:28.133
and using the tissue
inside the mouth

13:28.133 --> 13:30.767
to help advance the end
of the lip a little bit more.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.266
If this doesn't work,

13:32.266 --> 13:34.133
a second possibility would be
to do something

13:34.133 --> 13:37.000
called the superior-based
nasal-labial flap.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.667
In other words,
we take tissue from here,

13:39.667 --> 13:42.266
lift it up,
and insert it into that area.

13:42.266 --> 13:45.000
That's something that
is a little bit more aggressive,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.133
but that is a possibility.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.367
You know,
if we're gonna do this,

13:49.367 --> 13:51.300
I have to think about it.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.033
So I'm not gonna give you
a definitive answer right now

13:53.033 --> 13:54.700
whether we do the simpler one

13:54.700 --> 13:56.400
versus just go
for the big procedure.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.033
- This is the reason you come
to people like us,

13:59.033 --> 14:02.166
is because we're gonna
figure it out exhaustively

14:02.166 --> 14:05.033
before we subject you
to a procedure

14:05.033 --> 14:06.266
that's a definitive procedure.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.700
Do you want to go for this?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.033
- Yes, I do.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.033
I put my trust in both of you.

14:12.033 --> 14:13.400
Knowing that this man
could give my life back

14:13.400 --> 14:15.133
is the best thing
I could ever think of.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.166
- I'm on board
if you're on board.

14:16.166 --> 14:18.033
- I'm on board.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.400
Dr. Nassif's gonna make me
myself again.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.433
This Jersey girl is happy.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.033
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Pleasure meeting you.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.033
- See you soon, thank you.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.300
- When did you first hear
about this?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.166
- Today.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.400
- You just broke it
to your best friend today?

14:31.400 --> 14:32.433
Let me show you.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.033
Hello.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.333
- Those are bigger
than basketballs.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.200
No wonder her skin
is about to die.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.400
Jesus.

14:44.734 --> 14:46.467
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

14:49.200 --> 14:51.066
- I'm ready.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.667
- Ready to see
the Hollywood Hills?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.333
- I like to think of them
as my Golden Globes.

14:54.333 --> 14:58.333
- Let's commemorate
this moment in time forever.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.467
God, those are beautiful.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.467
They are so--I mean, thank you.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.333
I'm really excited
to see the doctors,

15:05.333 --> 15:08.200
and I wanted to cast my breasts
and take it to them.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.667
So I'm sure
they're gonna love it.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.300
Guess I can help you
cut the strips.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.600
- I'm sorry, I'm not hearing

15:12.600 --> 15:14.367
anything you're saying
right now.

15:14.367 --> 15:15.367
- I'm not really even listening
to what I'm reading.

15:15.367 --> 15:16.767
So it's fine.

15:16.767 --> 15:18.100
I'm just enjoying this moment.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
- Doing the cast is really fun,

15:20.100 --> 15:22.233
because I get to massage my
wife's breasts for 30 minutes.

15:22.233 --> 15:23.367
So it's a win-win.

15:23.367 --> 15:24.700
Amazing.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.767
- Yeah, I'm glad you like this.

15:25.767 --> 15:26.767
I thought you would.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.367
- This is art work.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.100
- Well, that's kind of
how I look at it.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.767
It may not be everybody's
type of art,

15:31.767 --> 15:33.300
but you appreciate it
as much as I do, if not more.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.767
- No complaints here.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.367
Now these got to go in
through the cleavage.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.767
- Mm-hmm, the chasm.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.033
- The pit of despair.

15:41.033 --> 15:42.100
No, absolutely--

15:42.100 --> 15:43.367
- Yeah, I was gonna say,

15:43.367 --> 15:45.100
I don't know
if it's the pit of despair.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.433
- I think it's...
- The Pearly Gates.

15:46.433 --> 15:47.767
- I love showcasing her.

15:47.767 --> 15:49.367
If you have a nice Bentley,

15:49.367 --> 15:51.233
you want to take it out,
you want to show it off,

15:51.233 --> 15:53.100
you want people to admire it,

15:53.100 --> 15:56.000
because that's what beautiful
things are created for.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.266
- Oh, my god.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.400
Even these are heavy.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.734
- Those suckers are huge.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.066
Oh, my god, my boobs are huge.

16:04.066 --> 16:06.333
Look at you.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.400
- Wow, I can hear
the ocean in here.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.266
My wife's breasts
are bigger than my head,

16:11.266 --> 16:14.266
and I have a big head,
a huge head, okay?

16:14.266 --> 16:16.133
It just makes me so proud,

16:16.133 --> 16:19.100
in the weirdest,
strangest way possible.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.333
This actually makes them
look pretty...

16:20.333 --> 16:21.533
- Yeah.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.133
- I would love for the doctors

16:23.133 --> 16:25.200
to be able
to fix the asymmetry.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.133
It really doesn't matter
which one is which.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.667
If I could get
the easy-going girl

16:28.667 --> 16:30.400
to be lifted up
a little bit more

16:30.400 --> 16:32.200
or the diva
to just settle down

16:32.200 --> 16:34.000
into her little space
and be happy,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
it would really help me know

16:36.000 --> 16:39.033
that I've refined my breasts
as much as I possibly could.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.166
This one is more of a football,

16:40.166 --> 16:41.567
and this one's
more basketball.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.166
- Yeah, exactly,
both your favorite sports.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.033
- My two favorite sports, yeah.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.300
- Memory made.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
Let's go see
what the docs can do.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.266
- Our next patient is Sharon.

16:54.266 --> 16:56.567
And she was born
with spina bifida.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.433
She doesn't look like someone
who has spina bifida.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.166
She's walking around
on two legs.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.166
Patients with spina bifida

17:02.166 --> 17:04.500
have an incomplete development
of the spinal cord.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.533
Have an often
incomplete development

17:06.533 --> 17:08.300
of their lower extremities

17:08.300 --> 17:11.033
and end up in wheelchairs
and unable to walk.

17:11.033 --> 17:16.767
It left her with a very unusual
cosmetic development.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.433
What are you looking at?

17:21.266 --> 17:23.000
What kind of a structure
is that?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.200
Can it be moved?

17:24.200 --> 17:25.467
- Why don't you have Sharon
come in?

17:25.467 --> 17:28.066
- Can you please
send in Sharon?

17:28.066 --> 17:29.333
- Sharon.
- Hello.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.200
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

17:32.467 --> 17:34.400
- It's Laquoshia.
- Laquoshia, Dr. Nassif.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.133
- Hi, Laquoshia,
Terry Dubrow.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.333
Nice to meet you,
please have a seat.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.734
- Best friends.

17:39.734 --> 17:41.333
- Best friends.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.600
- Since second grade.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.333
= Oh, a long time.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.066
Longer than us.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.200
- Yeah, we didn't know
each other that long.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.467
- No.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.600
- Long time.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.567
- Still don't like him.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.066
- I'm here today because I've
waited 36 years

17:55.066 --> 17:56.467
to see if it was possible

17:56.467 --> 17:59.066
to correct the deformity
that I have.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.467
I want to be in the mirror,

18:00.467 --> 18:02.500
looking at my bikini bottom,
saying, "Mm-hmm."

18:02.500 --> 18:04.367
- Obviously what we're
focused on today

18:04.367 --> 18:06.633
is that area
of the upper buttock.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.767
You've only had
one operation, right?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.500
- Mm-hmm, yes.
- As a baby.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.500
- So what was found
at the operation?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.367
- I was actually born
with a tumor

18:14.367 --> 18:16.233
in the lower part of my back.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.633
- Right.

18:17.633 --> 18:21.300
You had that spina bifida
cyst structure

18:21.300 --> 18:22.633
that they operated on.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.367
They called it a tumor,
though, huh?

18:24.367 --> 18:26.233
- Yeah, that's what I was
always told it was.

18:26.233 --> 18:28.367
I actually contracted
staph infection,

18:28.367 --> 18:30.233
so I was in the hospital

18:30.233 --> 18:33.500
from January, when I was born,
until March.

18:33.500 --> 18:37.233
- I wonder if that contributed
to this fullness?

18:37.233 --> 18:38.567
- That's a good question.

18:38.567 --> 18:41.367
Okay, so physically,
does it limit--

18:41.367 --> 18:43.266
Can you lay back normally?

18:43.266 --> 18:45.133
- If I sit back, like, now,

18:45.133 --> 18:47.133
because it's there,
I can't sit flat,

18:47.133 --> 18:48.533
so I kind of arch.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.400
Because of my job,
I have to sit down for 12 hours,

18:50.400 --> 18:52.200
so it gets uncomfortable.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.266
I have to lean up.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.066
- I'm a 911 dispatcher.

18:56.066 --> 18:58.100
- Yeah, so your job
is to remain calm.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.133
You're calm,
I can tell you that.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.600
- Yeah, she's calm.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.400
- Nothing seems to faze Sharon,

19:03.400 --> 19:05.133
not even the sight of Paul.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.133
You guys have talked
about this before, right?

19:07.133 --> 19:08.667
- No.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.266
- You've never--
have you ever seen it?

19:10.266 --> 19:11.533
- No.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.266
- Best friend
since second grade,

19:14.266 --> 19:15.467
she didn't know about this?

19:15.467 --> 19:16.533
How did you hide it from her?

19:16.533 --> 19:18.400
- I got good at hiding it.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.000
- When did you first
hear about this?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.533
- Today.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.567
- You just broke it
to your best friend

19:24.567 --> 19:26.433
since second grade today?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.033
- When Sharon told me
she was going

19:28.033 --> 19:29.433
to see two doctors
in California,

19:29.433 --> 19:31.166
the first thing I thought,

19:31.166 --> 19:34.300
"Hey, we're going
to California."

19:34.300 --> 19:36.166
- How much
does this bother you?

19:36.166 --> 19:37.567
You're so stoic,

19:37.567 --> 19:39.567
it doesn't seem
like it bothers you that much.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.567
- I'm used to it,
but it still--

19:41.567 --> 19:43.300
I see certain outfits
that I want to wear.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.433
I can't wear it.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.500
About to cry.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.166
- That explains it.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.567
I wasn't at her wedding...

19:52.567 --> 20:00.367
♪ ♪

20:00.367 --> 20:03.300
I wasn't at her wedding
because of it.

20:03.300 --> 20:08.266
- The bridesmaid dresses, right.

20:08.266 --> 20:10.066
So what did you tell her

20:10.066 --> 20:11.467
was the reason you
couldn't be in the wedding?

20:11.467 --> 20:13.400
- I told her
that I didn't have the money.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.467
Laquoshia's wedding represented
a big part of her life,

20:16.467 --> 20:19.333
and I couldn't experience it
the way she wanted me to,

20:19.333 --> 20:21.467
because I was ashamed,

20:21.467 --> 20:25.467
and I just didn't know how
to tell her exactly

20:25.467 --> 20:27.467
why I couldn't be
in her wedding.

20:27.467 --> 20:29.400
- I find excitement in this,

20:29.400 --> 20:32.333
to give a person, potentially,
the opportunity

20:32.333 --> 20:34.600
to go from this place
in their life

20:34.600 --> 20:36.467
to that place in their life.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.467
So let's go in the exam room
and have a closer look.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.467
Sharon has one of the more
significant problems

20:40.467 --> 20:42.333
that I've seen in a long while.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.266
If there was ever a case
that needed our attention,

20:45.266 --> 20:48.633
this is the one.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.433
- This is it.
- Everything will be fine.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.233
- Just relax.

20:52.233 --> 20:54.633
- Can't tell someone that's
having surgery to relax.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.100
- I was doing a fill for her.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.734
- Yeah.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.500
- You know what we call
injecting saline into a port?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.233
We call that
the practice of medicine.

21:02.233 --> 21:03.600
Okay, that's interesting.

21:09.633 --> 21:12.433
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

21:12.433 --> 21:14.467
- Okay, stand up.

21:14.467 --> 21:15.633
Did you show it to her yet?

21:15.633 --> 21:16.633
- No.
- Okay.

21:16.633 --> 21:17.633
- So we'll show you.

21:17.633 --> 21:18.633
It's not shocking.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.100
But it's different.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.433
So here it is.

21:25.467 --> 21:28.333
Okay, now you can see why...

21:28.333 --> 21:29.667
- Yeah.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.533
- She couldn't wear
a bridesmaid dress.

21:31.533 --> 21:34.200
- Actually seeing
what she was going through,

21:34.200 --> 21:36.667
It almost felt like somebody
kicked me in my throat.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.667
Like, "Kugh!"

21:42.266 --> 21:43.433
Yeah.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.467
- I'm so sorry.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.266
I'm sorry that you had
to go through this.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.266
- Obviously, we know that.

22:05.266 --> 22:07.633
Sitting here listening to this,
you see this.

22:07.633 --> 22:09.400
It's surreal.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.300
And now luckily
you're in this guy's hands.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.567
It's so heartbreaking
to be hindered

22:12.567 --> 22:14.433
with a problem like this.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.700
But I have the utmost hope
that if anyone

22:15.700 --> 22:17.567
can help Sharon move on
and live the life

22:17.567 --> 22:20.033
that she wants to
and deserves,

22:20.033 --> 22:22.400
it's my good friend here,
Terry Dubrow.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.433
- The buttock is completely
normal in the lower portions.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.567
But, as you can feel,

22:27.567 --> 22:30.433
this is clearly fatty tissue.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.300
I've never seen this.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.367
I don't think any
plastic surgeon on earth

22:34.367 --> 22:36.033
has ever seen this.

22:36.033 --> 22:38.700
To fix this, we've got to make
incisions all over it

22:38.700 --> 22:43.166
and start removing,
lifting, tucking.

22:43.166 --> 22:46.567
This is a nip/tuck
like no other.

22:46.567 --> 22:49.033
Sharon's condition
is so unique,

22:49.033 --> 22:51.533
that I've never even heard
of anyone performing

22:51.533 --> 22:53.333
this type of surgery before.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.734
That makes it very scary,

22:54.734 --> 22:57.567
but at the same time,
very cool.

22:57.567 --> 23:00.200
If you're up for it,
I'm up for it.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.433
- I'm up for it.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.467
- You're a good friend.

23:02.467 --> 23:03.734
Much better than you are.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.500
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

23:11.734 --> 23:13.667
- Hi.
- Good morning.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.033
- I'm here for my surgery
with Dr. Nassif.

23:16.033 --> 23:17.467
- Perfect, I'll let them know
you're here.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.467
Just have a seat
right in those chairs.

23:19.467 --> 23:21.533
- Today my mom has come with me
for my surgery.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.266
Because who doesn't
want their mom after surgery?

23:23.266 --> 23:24.333
Let's be serious.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.600
- This is it.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.333
- I'm gonna throw up.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.066
- Everything will be fine,
just relax.

23:29.066 --> 23:30.567
- Can't tell someone that's
having surgery to relax.

23:30.567 --> 23:32.266
- Just think of it as,

23:32.266 --> 23:33.734
you're gonna be able
to eat again,

23:33.734 --> 23:35.500
gonna be able
to open your mouth again.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.233
- Hopefully.

23:37.233 --> 23:38.767
I just don't want
to get my hopes up,

23:38.767 --> 23:40.633
because every time I've went
into surgery so far,

23:40.633 --> 23:42.500
I always had a picture
of a different outcome,

23:42.500 --> 23:43.633
and every time I came
off of anesthesia,

23:43.633 --> 23:44.767
it was basically no difference.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.500
And I'm just praying to God

23:46.500 --> 23:47.767
it's not like this,
this time around.

23:47.767 --> 23:49.100
- So let's talk about this.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.633
When I saw you last time,

23:50.633 --> 23:52.600
I was talking
about different things.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.734
I'm thinking, before I put
a gigantic scar on your face,

23:54.734 --> 23:58.233
I'd rather see if I can use
the tissue inside your mouth.

23:58.233 --> 23:59.767
- Okay.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.500
- If I get in there
and I feel like I can't do it,

24:01.500 --> 24:02.633
then we'll just go for it.

24:02.633 --> 24:04.734
- Okay, I'm just really clammy.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.567
- You know what,
it is okay to be nervous.

24:07.567 --> 24:09.367
My plan for Karissa's surgery

24:09.367 --> 24:11.367
is first to remove
a triangle-shaped flap,

24:11.367 --> 24:13.066
then I'll make an incision

24:13.066 --> 24:14.767
separating the upper
and lower lip,

24:14.767 --> 24:16.266
which will allow me
to extend the mucosa,

24:16.266 --> 24:17.467
the muscle, and the skin.

24:17.467 --> 24:18.600
Once I join them together,

24:18.600 --> 24:20.367
it will hopefully leave Karissa

24:20.367 --> 24:22.533
with a wider
and more even mouth.

24:22.533 --> 24:25.533
We're trying to create what we
call a buccal mucosal flap

24:25.533 --> 24:29.266
so that we can reconstruct
the lower lip.

24:29.266 --> 24:31.500
The buccal mucosa
is the wet tissue

24:31.500 --> 24:32.633
inside the mouth.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.367
This is buccal mucosa, here.

24:34.367 --> 24:36.600
We're lifting up
the vermilion mucosa,

24:36.600 --> 24:39.667
and we're separating it
from the orbicularis muscle.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.000
I have to use light tissue
for light tissue,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.333
so I'm gonna use
inside mouth skin

24:44.333 --> 24:46.500
to re-create the outer edge
of her lip.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.400
We're creating
a new edge of her lip

24:48.400 --> 24:49.533
which she's never had before.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.500
This is called the commissure.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.667
Now gonna take this muscle,
stitch it to here.

24:53.667 --> 24:57.000
Dawn's gonna take that muscle
and stitch it over there,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.133
so that will make
the new commissure.

24:59.133 --> 25:01.567
Hold on, if we stitch
the muscle to the skin,

25:01.567 --> 25:03.367
why do we want the muscle?

25:03.367 --> 25:05.433
- Because that's the anchor
of the whole thing.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.433
- What is that gonna do
negatively?

25:07.433 --> 25:08.700
- It's going to give her

25:08.700 --> 25:10.567
a little bit of a grimace,
like this.

25:10.567 --> 25:13.000
It's basically like
a very gentle swing.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.567
- Let's see here;
let's take a look.

25:14.567 --> 25:16.166
Having Dr. Yu
and Dr. Irvine here

25:16.166 --> 25:17.700
here to bounce ideas off

25:17.700 --> 25:19.700
is like having
the '92 Dream Team

25:19.700 --> 25:21.433
in the operating room with me.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.700
You know, Michael Jordan,
maybe he's the king,

25:23.700 --> 25:25.700
but he still needed
Scottie Pippen

25:25.700 --> 25:28.133
and Magic Johnson
to win the gold.

25:28.133 --> 25:30.033
This is just adding
extra support.

25:30.033 --> 25:31.767
Now, the thing is,

25:31.767 --> 25:34.000
Karissa is gonna look
a little bit like the Joker,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.433
but the sutures should dissolve
in about four to six weeks.

25:36.433 --> 25:39.300
To help keep Karissa's
corner of her mouth elevated,

25:39.300 --> 25:41.533
we're gonna use
a percutaneous cable suture.

25:41.533 --> 25:43.066
That means I'm taking a stitch,

25:43.066 --> 25:45.066
stitching it down
to the temporalis fascia,

25:45.066 --> 25:46.600
passing it under the skin,

25:46.600 --> 25:48.533
attaching it
to the corner of the mouth,

25:48.533 --> 25:51.166
and then tying it--
in essence, lifting it up.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.066
All right, well, the mouth
is already looking wider.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.600
And this is the final stage.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.333
Oh, yeah, that's so much better.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.133
I'm cautiously optimistic

25:58.133 --> 26:00.133
that I've improved
Karissa's mouth.

26:00.133 --> 26:01.734
However, we're not
out of the woods yet.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.033
She can actually contract down,
get scar tissue.

26:04.033 --> 26:05.533
Any number of things
can happen.

26:05.533 --> 26:07.433
So I just want to see
how it goes.

26:07.433 --> 26:09.166
I just don't want to be
too excited yet.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.734
Great job.

26:11.734 --> 26:13.734
- Because I've never done
this procedure before

26:13.734 --> 26:15.066
and no one ever has,

26:15.066 --> 26:16.600
the body really is guiding us.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.433
- It looks so much worse
in person.

26:18.433 --> 26:20.467
- The photo doesn't
do it justice.

26:20.467 --> 26:22.166
See if you get them to--yeah.

26:22.166 --> 26:23.633
So you can get them to move.

26:23.633 --> 26:24.767
- Oh, yeah, I've got
really good...

26:24.767 --> 26:26.100
- Yeah.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.633
- She's great at parties.

26:33.767 --> 26:38.033
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

26:38.033 --> 26:40.166
- Hi, I'm Sharon,
I have to check in for surgery.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.633
- Hi, go ahead and sign in,

26:41.633 --> 26:43.500
and we'll get you taken
right back.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.033
- It's very exciting
to know that this is the end

26:46.033 --> 26:48.033
of living with this deformity.

26:48.033 --> 26:50.500
- So what's gonna be the first
outfit you're gonna wear?

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
- Whatever you make for me,
I'll wear it.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.600
- Oh, I feel so special.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.033
- You are.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.200
- Just a little bit.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.166
- Just a little bit.

26:59.166 --> 27:00.500
- I'm a designer,

27:00.500 --> 27:02.633
and once she's all healed up,

27:02.633 --> 27:06.000
I just want to make her
something that's just gonna pop.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.100
- Sharon.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.233
- Hello.

27:08.233 --> 27:09.667
- Good.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.200
- A little bit.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.533
- Just a little.

27:12.533 --> 27:14.467
- That's pretty good,

27:14.467 --> 27:15.533
because I'm really nervous.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.667
I'm just kidding.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.533
What I find a little bit scary

27:18.533 --> 27:21.533
is that, because you had
the spinal situation at birth,

27:21.533 --> 27:25.000
do you still have
spinal cord elements

27:25.000 --> 27:26.734
at the bottom of this?

27:26.734 --> 27:30.066
Obviously, when I go in there
to do what I planned,

27:30.066 --> 27:31.767
I'm gonna be very cognizant
of the fact

27:31.767 --> 27:34.533
that I could run into tissue

27:34.533 --> 27:37.200
that isn't normally
in that area.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.533
Even though I've done
a ton of butt surgeries,

27:39.533 --> 27:42.500
I've never really done
anything like this.

27:42.500 --> 27:47.166
This is going to be different
and really special, I hope.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.033
We're gonna take these down.

27:49.033 --> 27:51.033
In addition, I think
we should lipo some of this.

27:51.033 --> 27:52.433
- Yeah.

27:52.433 --> 27:55.567
- So de-bulk, remove,
lift, tuck.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.033
Do you have any questions
for us?

27:57.033 --> 27:59.000
- No.
- You're just so calm.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.567
- I've had to be stoic
in my life to protect myself.

28:01.567 --> 28:03.667
And I'm just ready
for a change.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.533
- Sharon's surgery
is unlike anything

28:05.533 --> 28:06.767
I've ever done before.

28:06.767 --> 28:08.533
I will begin by liposuctioning

28:08.533 --> 28:10.233
her lower back
and upper buttock.

28:10.233 --> 28:12.000
Then, I'll make an incision

28:12.000 --> 28:13.567
around the base
of the protruding mounds

28:13.567 --> 28:15.300
and remove the excess tissue.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.633
Finally, I will do
a butt tuck and lift,

28:17.633 --> 28:19.767
where I'll trim
the lower portion of her back

28:19.767 --> 28:21.700
into the upper portion
of her buttock,

28:21.700 --> 28:25.133
hopefully giving Sharon
a natural-looking contour.

28:25.133 --> 28:26.600
- It looks so much worse
in person.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.200
The picture
doesn't do it justice.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.166
- Right, the photo
doesn't do it justice.

28:31.734 --> 28:34.266
Okay, so first we're gonna do
some liposuction.

28:34.266 --> 28:37.200
So I'm liposuctioning
the surrounding tissue,

28:37.200 --> 28:39.600
sort of creating a nice frame

28:39.600 --> 28:43.600
around the hopefully
nicely reconstructed buttock.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.066
Look at all that fat.

28:45.066 --> 28:46.567
As I had hoped,

28:46.567 --> 28:48.567
there were no
spinal cord elements

28:48.567 --> 28:51.533
in the excess tissue
in Sharon's back area.

28:51.533 --> 28:53.333
Okay, so now we're
making an incision.

28:53.333 --> 28:57.200
So we're gonna take
the top of this mound off.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.333
- Her body is telling you
what to do.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.300
- Her body really is
guiding us.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.266
There's sort of a plane
defined by scar tissue

29:04.266 --> 29:06.734
that has tethered
this area down.

29:06.734 --> 29:09.066
Just out of curiosity,

29:09.066 --> 29:11.200
let's just staple that together
and see what that looks like.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.033
Because I've never done
this procedure before

29:13.033 --> 29:14.600
and no one ever has,

29:14.600 --> 29:17.633
we're gonna do this
in conservative steps.

29:17.633 --> 29:19.767
We have tucked in
the upper part

29:19.767 --> 29:22.200
into the lower part
of the back.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.033
That's kind of giving her
a buttock lift.

29:24.033 --> 29:25.367
Come on, that's pretty cool.

29:25.367 --> 29:27.066
- Yeah, because
it contours here.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.767
- Yeah, maybe
we should do that.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.700
Should we do
the other side first?

29:30.700 --> 29:33.066
There's no blueprint
for Sharon's surgery.

29:33.066 --> 29:34.734
By following my gut

29:34.734 --> 29:38.033
and removing
what seems appropriate,

29:38.033 --> 29:40.633
I think I can visualize
the final result.

29:40.633 --> 29:44.066
Now we're just making
minor ass-justments.

29:44.066 --> 29:45.600
Get it?

29:45.600 --> 29:47.200
- Looks amazing;
let's hope it heals.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.300
- Yeah.

29:51.266 --> 29:53.000
All right, we have a patient
named Allegra

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
who has had
three breast surgeries

29:55.000 --> 29:56.133
and is having problems
with them.

29:56.133 --> 29:57.133
Let me show you.

29:57.133 --> 29:58.600
Hello!

29:58.600 --> 30:00.233
- Those are bigger
than basketballs.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.000
No wonder her skin
is about to die--Jesus.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.633
So why don't you
bring in Allegra?

30:05.633 --> 30:08.400
- Can you please
send in Allegra?

30:08.400 --> 30:10.066
Allegra, hi, Dr. Nassif.

30:10.066 --> 30:11.133
- Hi, nice to meet you.

30:11.133 --> 30:12.667
- Hi, Allegra, Terry Dubrow.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.266
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:14.266 --> 30:16.100
- I think Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow,

30:16.100 --> 30:18.000
even though they're
in the profession

30:18.000 --> 30:19.100
and they probably see
hundreds and thousands

30:19.100 --> 30:20.367
of boobs every year,

30:20.367 --> 30:22.133
I doubt they see
many like hers.

30:22.133 --> 30:23.767
You know, I'm married to her,

30:23.767 --> 30:25.200
and I wake up to her
some mornings, and I'm like,

30:25.200 --> 30:27.100
whoa, those are nice.

30:27.100 --> 30:29.734
- I know this may be
a little unexpected,

30:29.734 --> 30:31.233
but we have a gift
for you guys,

30:31.233 --> 30:32.300
a little bit of art.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.033
- Are you guys okay
if we...

30:35.033 --> 30:36.033
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

30:36.033 --> 30:37.166
- She's an artist.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.300
- Oh, my god.

30:38.300 --> 30:40.133
- Whoa.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.166
- So there's the asymmetry.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.100
- There it is.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.000
- Absolutely.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.166
- That is craziness.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.567
- Stand up for a moment, please.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.400
Okay, there we go.

30:54.567 --> 30:55.700
- You wear them well.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.300
- Wait, hold on.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.700
- Is it weird that I think
my wife's breasts

30:58.700 --> 31:00.266
look good on Dr. Dubrow?

31:00.266 --> 31:02.166
Feel how heavy
just the cast is.

31:02.166 --> 31:03.700
So, I mean,
it begs the question,

31:03.700 --> 31:06.033
how many cc
does this represent?

31:06.033 --> 31:08.033
- 4,600 cc.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.000
- Per breast.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.400
- Wow.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.300
- This is actually
a fantastic gift.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
I've always wanted
a Golden Globe,

31:15.300 --> 31:17.066
and now I have two of them.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.166
How many breast surgeries
have you had?

31:18.166 --> 31:19.600
- Three.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.700
- And how many cc
was the original on?

31:20.700 --> 31:22.266
- 800 cc.

31:22.266 --> 31:24.033
- You went right to full size.
- Oh, yeah.

31:24.033 --> 31:25.000
- And did you have
any problems with it?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.300
- None.

31:26.300 --> 31:27.200
- What made you want
to go bigger?

31:27.200 --> 31:28.734
- I just wanted more.

31:28.734 --> 31:30.667
- So you went in
to another doctor.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.400
- I did, I said, ultimately,
I'd love to have 2,000 cc.

31:32.400 --> 31:36.667
And he said, "The most I think
I can do is 1,700."

31:36.667 --> 31:39.567
- We have a term for doctors

31:39.567 --> 31:43.000
who put more than twice
the recommended volume

31:43.000 --> 31:45.066
in a breast implant pocket.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.333
They are called insane.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.467
And what made you decide
to do this?

31:49.467 --> 31:51.700
- I'm an envelope-pusher.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.066
I love the way it looked,
yes, extreme.

31:54.066 --> 31:55.433
It just wasn't enough for me.

31:55.433 --> 31:59.333
I found a doctor
who did expanders.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.233
- Oh.

32:01.233 --> 32:04.367
And so they put a 2,000-ish cc
tissue expander in,

32:04.367 --> 32:07.633
and then serially
injected saline.

32:07.633 --> 32:11.100
- How many times did it take you
to get up to this size, 4,600?

32:11.100 --> 32:12.500
- We've probably done,
like, five or six.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.033
I was doing a fill for her--

32:14.033 --> 32:15.367
- Yeah, I do it.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.033
- Yeah.

32:17.033 --> 32:18.300
- They give you needles
and syringes

32:18.300 --> 32:19.700
and say, hey, can you do it?

32:19.700 --> 32:20.767
- Son of a doctor.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.367
I'm not really concerned.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.100
He's been--I feel comfortable
that he knows.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.767
I trust him.

32:25.767 --> 32:27.367
- Just because
you're the son of a doctor

32:27.367 --> 32:28.433
doesn't actually
make you a doctor.

32:28.433 --> 32:29.734
Usually you have to go

32:29.734 --> 32:31.467
to, you know, medical school

32:31.467 --> 32:34.300
before you can
call yourself a doctor.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.033
- I'm not ridiculous,

32:36.033 --> 32:38.200
in that I can't see
that I need to be careful.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.400
- By the way, the careful ship
sailed 4,000 cc ago.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.000
That ship is on the other side
of the world right now.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.266
- Careful on the crazy ship,
how about that?

32:47.266 --> 32:49.233
- I'm not making calls
about crazy.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.000
I'm just saying
careful and risks.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
- Right.
- Yeah.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.266
- Okay, but you're in to see us,
and you have a problem, right?

32:55.266 --> 32:57.133
- I do.

32:57.133 --> 32:59.400
- The issue for me is symmetry.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.467
I just absolutely
adore the size,

33:02.467 --> 33:04.667
But I would love them
to be more symmetrical.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.266
- I think it has to be
the most important point,

33:06.266 --> 33:07.266
is similar tissues.

33:07.266 --> 33:08.400
- It's exactly right.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.400
So why don't we have a look?

33:09.400 --> 33:12.133
- Great, love it.

33:12.133 --> 33:13.667
- It's like a face lift
to the butt.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.333
- Oh, my gosh.

33:24.033 --> 33:26.166
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

33:26.166 --> 33:29.033
- So let's have a look
at the situation.

33:29.033 --> 33:30.133
Okay, hello.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.567
So this is very firm.

33:33.567 --> 33:36.166
This is much firmer
and much higher.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.400
- It is.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.166
- And here's the port,
right here.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.033
So this is where you inject
on both sides, right?

33:41.033 --> 33:42.300
So do me a favor.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.433
Put your hands on your hips
and push.

33:44.433 --> 33:46.433
See if you can get them
to--yeah.

33:46.433 --> 33:48.033
So you can get them to move
by flexing.

33:48.033 --> 33:49.433
- Oh, yeah, I've got
really good--

33:49.433 --> 33:51.133
- She's great at parties.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.266
- I'm a great party trick, yeah.

33:53.266 --> 33:56.433
- It's important that I see how
mobile Allegra's breasts are,

33:56.433 --> 33:58.166
because the less mobile
they are,

33:58.166 --> 34:00.333
the more difficulty
we may encounter

34:00.333 --> 34:02.066
when we get inside

34:02.066 --> 34:04.166
and try to manipulate
that scar tissue.

34:04.166 --> 34:05.734
You do have obvious signs

34:05.734 --> 34:09.066
that the skin has been
stretched to the maximum.

34:09.066 --> 34:12.200
So when you see blood vessels
that are dilated like this,

34:12.200 --> 34:15.333
it indicates that, you know,
they need help.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.300
If this is the limit,
you're here.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.600
You've gone way over the limit.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.333
- I was just looking
at these, like...

34:20.333 --> 34:23.200
- Yeah, this is
the normal size breast implant.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.433
Your breast implants poop
bigger than this, you know?

34:25.433 --> 34:26.600
- Right, I'm sure.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.400
- Oh, god.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.133
Seriously, Terry, poop?

34:30.133 --> 34:32.033
Poop, really?

34:32.033 --> 34:33.467
- So this one is encapsulated.

34:33.467 --> 34:36.600
Encapsulation means scar tissue
has grown around it

34:36.600 --> 34:38.333
to protect everything.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.600
So the operation
to improve symmetry

34:41.600 --> 34:45.500
is to go in
and cut scar tissue.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.467
The problem is,
if you take tissue

34:47.467 --> 34:49.100
that's under great tension,

34:49.100 --> 34:50.467
that's having problems

34:50.467 --> 34:52.333
getting blood flow in,
blood flow out,

34:52.333 --> 34:54.467
and you make cuts in it,
you're cutting blood supply,

34:54.467 --> 34:56.233
you're thinning out the tissue,

34:56.233 --> 34:58.633
and you're exposing it
to very significant trauma.

34:58.633 --> 35:01.100
I would bet you,
if you did that,

35:01.100 --> 35:03.100
that, first of all,
you'd have problems

35:03.100 --> 35:04.633
getting this incision to heal.

35:04.633 --> 35:07.500
Do you know what's directly
underneath that open tissue?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.233
The implant.

35:09.233 --> 35:13.100
Once the implant is exposed,
game over, baby.

35:13.100 --> 35:16.367
Done-zo, over,
bye-bye big breasts forever.

35:16.367 --> 35:19.100
- The worst-case scenario for me
would be losing my boobs,

35:19.100 --> 35:20.767
and I love my boobs.

35:20.767 --> 35:23.400
So living with asymmetry now,
all things considered,

35:23.400 --> 35:25.133
I'm happy to live with it.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.667
- We don't want to do that.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.133
- Especially right now,
because right now,

35:29.133 --> 35:30.266
your tissue is doing decent.

35:30.266 --> 35:31.633
- Tissue's alive.
- Okay.

35:31.633 --> 35:33.533
- Take the syringes
and throw them away.

35:33.533 --> 35:34.633
- Okay.

35:36.233 --> 35:37.266
- Yeah, definitely.

35:37.266 --> 35:39.133
- You're the man.

35:39.133 --> 35:40.400
- I kind of had a feeling
you would say that anyway,

35:40.400 --> 35:42.000
and I was like, yeah,
I'm ready for it.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.266
- It was a pleasure
meeting you.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.667
- Thank you very much.

35:44.667 --> 35:46.133
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Thank you.

35:46.133 --> 35:47.500
- Allegra and her husband

35:47.500 --> 35:49.367
are really playing
with fire here.

35:49.367 --> 35:51.266
They have to stop doing
any more breast surgery,

35:51.266 --> 35:54.367
or they just may end up
burning the whole house down.

35:54.367 --> 35:56.133
- We're good.

35:56.133 --> 35:57.500
We've kind of poked the bear
enough now.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.533
- So the crazy train
has to come to a stop

35:59.533 --> 36:02.266
and turn around,
or just go another direction?

36:02.266 --> 36:04.533
- We're just taking crazy
in a whole different direction.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.133
- Yeah.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.166
- Hello, young ladies.
- Hello, hello.

36:12.166 --> 36:13.533
- Good.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.300
You were able to walk okay?

36:16.300 --> 36:17.667
- Mm-hmm.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.433
- It's more of a...

36:19.433 --> 36:22.166
- Discomfort more
than actual pain, mm-hmm.

36:22.166 --> 36:23.567
- Let me see
what it looks like now.

36:23.567 --> 36:25.567
By the end, it was starting
to look really good.

36:25.567 --> 36:27.533
- I have no idea what to expect,

36:27.533 --> 36:31.567
but I know, whatever it is,
it's gonna be awesome.

36:31.567 --> 36:34.400
- Oh, my gosh.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.567
Sharon.

36:39.567 --> 36:41.166
That is awesome.

36:44.133 --> 36:46.033
- These extra rolls,
remember those?

36:46.033 --> 36:47.734
I removed them.

36:47.734 --> 36:49.734
- So when you removed them,
it means you pulled them...

36:49.734 --> 36:51.467
- I lifted up the back part,

36:51.467 --> 36:54.200
pulled it down,
and cut it off.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.300
And then I took this part,
pulled it up,

36:56.300 --> 36:57.600
cut off the two mounds.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.567
- Just by lifting it up,
you got rid of it?

36:59.567 --> 37:01.467
- It's like a face lift
to the butt.

37:01.467 --> 37:03.166
- I'm really impressed
with Terry on this one.

37:03.166 --> 37:05.300
This is a fantastic result.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.600
- That is gorgeous.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.467
- Yes.

37:10.467 --> 37:12.700
- Okay, that's your before.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.333
That's your after.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.467
- Wow.

37:17.467 --> 37:19.300
That is amazing.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.200
I'm in complete shock
right now.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.200
This turned out better
than I even expected.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.467
I didn't think it was me.

37:24.467 --> 37:26.467
- So cautiously optimistic
right now.

37:26.467 --> 37:29.367
Your only job is to heal,
take it easy.

37:29.367 --> 37:31.633
Don't bend forward
like this, okay?

37:31.633 --> 37:34.233
It's very important that Sharon

37:34.233 --> 37:37.467
follow the post-operative
instructions very carefully.

37:37.467 --> 37:40.200
This is a wound
under great tension.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.633
Everything could fall apart
really easily.

37:42.633 --> 37:44.233
- I don't know what to say.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.500
- I wasn't expecting it
to be that.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.500
- I can walk out like this.

37:58.767 --> 38:02.367
- Today marks the end
of a very long journey.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.500
Living with a growth
on my backside was traumatic.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.600
I can't even really put
into words how I feel now,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.667
not having to worry
about my backside.

38:11.667 --> 38:14.233
I'm still getting used
to the idea.

38:14.233 --> 38:16.000
Sometimes I look,
and I have to look again

38:16.000 --> 38:18.633
to make sure
that it belongs to me.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.400
- I've been waiting for this,

38:20.400 --> 38:23.667
because this has been
a long, long road for her,

38:23.667 --> 38:26.500
because she's always been
like a tomboy.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.500
It was certain things
that I know she wouldn't wear

38:29.500 --> 38:32.000
on account of her butt.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.533
- I'm so excited to see Sharon

38:33.533 --> 38:35.500
in an outfit
that I made for her.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.667
I know she's just gonna show off
her whole body now,

38:37.667 --> 38:40.266
especially the end.

38:40.266 --> 38:42.533
- So you think now she can
find her a man, girl?

38:42.533 --> 38:44.000
They see that back,
they're gonna say,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.533
"Ooh, hey, mama.

38:45.533 --> 38:48.667
Sexy mama."

38:48.667 --> 38:50.367
- Hi, guys.

38:50.367 --> 38:53.300
- Oh, my god!

38:53.300 --> 38:55.433
- Look at you!

38:55.433 --> 38:57.667
- Oh, my god!

38:57.667 --> 38:58.700
Wow!

38:58.700 --> 39:00.300
She's glowing.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.033
She's happy.

39:02.033 --> 39:04.300
All I know is,
she's got that tush.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.700
So beautiful, gorgeous.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.300
You are so complete now.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.700
- I feel like a new person.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.667
- No more wearing
the long t

39:10.667 --> 39:12.300
- Oh, no, no.

39:12.300 --> 39:13.700
Sharon is officially
out of hiding.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.700
Before my surgery,

39:15.700 --> 39:17.667
I was living with the results
of having spina bifida.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.700
It left me with
a totally misshapen backside.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.700
Now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
when I look in the mirror,

39:21.700 --> 39:25.266
I see the perfect backside
that I've always wanted.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.400
- So now are you gonna be
her top model?

39:27.400 --> 39:29.300
- Of course.

39:31.266 --> 39:33.300
- I got to relearn my body,
learn how to dress it now,

39:33.300 --> 39:35.200
and find Mr. Phillips.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.333
- So now you think
that I might can get

39:37.333 --> 39:39.433
a nice grown man
in the family now?

39:39.433 --> 39:40.700
- I mean, hey,
sounds good to me.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.467
I'll take all that.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.200
Hiding my flaws
became so important,

39:44.200 --> 39:46.333
that I was never able
to be fully myself,

39:46.333 --> 39:48.600
making intimate relationships
nearly impossible.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.467
I'm ready to show the world
the real me.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.200
- I don't know
if I'm ready for thongs yet.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.300
Maybe next year.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.600
- This is...

39:57.600 --> 39:59.333
The end.

40:00.333 --> 40:01.734
- Whoo!

40:01.734 --> 40:03.300
- It's been about
a year and a half

40:03.300 --> 40:05.066
since I actually got dressed up

40:05.066 --> 40:06.433
and gone out with the girls
for girls' night,

40:06.433 --> 40:08.700
but now I'm gonna be there.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.066
Hey, ladies.

40:10.066 --> 40:12.700
- Karissa, you look beautiful.

40:18.767 --> 40:22.233
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

40:22.233 --> 40:23.633
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:23.633 --> 40:24.767
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you again.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.300
- Pleasure to see you.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.100
When I woke up and I realized

40:28.100 --> 40:29.500
that I could open my mouth
fully, I was so shocked.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.100
It's such a big difference
already,

40:31.100 --> 40:32.500
and it's only gonna get better
from here.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.633
- So remember,
the scar is over here.

40:33.633 --> 40:35.367
- Yeah.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.100
- And the end of it
was right about there.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.200
How do you feel?

40:38.200 --> 40:39.700
- I feel good.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.633
Just a little uncomfortable
in this area.

40:41.633 --> 40:44.767
- So it's called
a percutaneous sling,

40:44.767 --> 40:47.333
where we put a stitch
in the corner of the mouth,

40:47.333 --> 40:49.367
and then took that suture,

40:49.367 --> 40:51.767
and then we stitched it
deep inside the tissue

40:51.767 --> 40:53.233
here in your scalp,

40:53.233 --> 40:55.300
so it kind of yanked it
out and up.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.000
In about 30 days,
it should dissolve.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.533
- Wouldn't my face drop,
you think, because of that?

40:59.533 --> 41:01.066
- Well, things hopefully

41:01.066 --> 41:02.533
are gonna kind of stay
at that level.

41:02.533 --> 41:03.734
- Gotcha.

41:03.734 --> 41:05.333
- Right now,
you got to be careful

41:05.333 --> 41:06.667
with everything;
we just repaired it.

41:06.667 --> 41:08.000
Don't want a lot of movement
with your mouth.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.533
- It's only day one,

41:09.533 --> 41:10.667
and I feel like
I'm on top of the world.

41:10.667 --> 41:11.667
And it's eventually gonna be

41:11.667 --> 41:13.533
the perfect vision

41:13.533 --> 41:15.133
of what I want to look like
for the rest of my life.

41:15.133 --> 41:16.266
I want to hug you.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.600
- Just don't hurt your mouth.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.133
- I won't, thank you so much.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.066
The last year and a half

41:26.066 --> 41:27.633
has literally been
like a roller coaster.

41:27.633 --> 41:29.734
You go from up to down,
just up, down.

41:29.734 --> 41:31.467
And now that I'm finally
at the top,

41:31.467 --> 41:32.667
I don't want to drop anywhere.

41:32.667 --> 41:35.000
I just want to keep going up.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.266
- I hope she looks good.

41:36.266 --> 41:37.667
I'm excited to see her.

41:37.667 --> 41:40.633
Maybe she'll go to Hoboken
with me now.

41:40.633 --> 41:41.700
- Yeah, that's true.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.500
She never wanted to leave.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
- Get her out of the house
a little bit.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.700
- It's been about
a year and a half

41:46.700 --> 41:48.567
since I actually got dressed up

41:48.567 --> 41:50.433
and gone out with the girls
for girls' night.

41:50.433 --> 41:52.433
Whenever I went out,
it was all negative.

41:52.433 --> 41:53.633
It was just like, "Oh, no,
what's wrong with her face?

41:53.633 --> 41:55.633
What happened to her?"

41:55.633 --> 41:58.033
But now I'm gonna look good,
and I'm gonna do this.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.500
Hey, ladies.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.033
- You look amazing!

42:01.033 --> 42:03.433
- You look so good.
- Beautiful.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.367
- You're looking good.
- Thank you.

42:05.367 --> 42:07.433
- I love your outfit.
- Thank you.

42:07.433 --> 42:08.567
How are you guys?

42:08.567 --> 42:09.767
- I'm all right.

42:09.767 --> 42:11.433
- You look so good.

42:11.433 --> 42:12.567
- Thanks, I feel good,
I look good.

42:12.567 --> 42:13.700
I feel really good, actually.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.033
- You look really good.

42:16.633 --> 42:19.367
After a few unsuccessful
reconstruction attempts,

42:19.367 --> 42:21.467
I lost all hope that I would
ever be able to eat,

42:21.467 --> 42:23.333
feel, or look normal
ever again.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.533
But now,
thanks to Dr. Nassif,

42:24.533 --> 42:26.467
I can open my mouth more,

42:26.467 --> 42:29.600
and when I look in the mirror,
I see my old self.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.734
I look better, I feel better.

42:30.734 --> 42:32.066
- You can tell.

42:32.066 --> 42:34.000
- And I have more of a mouth.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.734
So if you're staring at me,
it's because I look good.

42:35.734 --> 42:37.600
It's not just like,
"Damn, what happened to you?"

42:37.600 --> 42:39.467
When I was younger,
I was always life of the party,

42:39.467 --> 42:40.600
and then when this happened,

42:40.600 --> 42:42.066
I shy away from everything.

42:42.066 --> 42:44.000
I came so far from what I was,

42:44.000 --> 42:45.734
that I never thought
I would be anywhere close

42:45.734 --> 42:47.400
to back to my old self.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.734
But now I wake up
and I look in the mirror.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.066
I'm like, wow,
I actually look better.

42:50.066 --> 42:51.734
And that's an amazing feeling.

42:51.734 --> 42:53.600
I can't thank Dr. Nassif enough
or Dubrow enough,

42:53.600 --> 42:56.000
because I never thought
I'd be where I am now.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.734
I would like to make a toast,
ladies, to myself, of course,

42:58.734 --> 43:00.333
and for the next chapter
of my life.

43:00.333 --> 43:01.734
- Yes.
- Cheers.

43:01.734 --> 43:04.767
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

43:04.767 --> 43:06.100
- Do you want a bite
of my burger now?

43:06.100 --> 43:07.500
- Girl, I just had lip surgery.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.767
I got makeup on, I look good.

43:08.767 --> 43:10.500
But no, I will take
a fry, though.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.233
- I actually recognize you.

43:18.033 --> 43:19.500
- World-famous
drag superstar Detox.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.100
- I would remove these.

43:21.100 --> 43:22.567
- I don't need
your little bitch ass

43:22.567 --> 43:24.500
telling me to go fix it.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
- I had a little friend
come over who's gonna help us.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.500
- Okay.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.233
- The leech lady.

43:29.233 --> 43:30.734
- The last thing
she probably thinks about

43:30.734 --> 43:32.500
is having a leech on her face.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.367
Sorry.

43:34.367 --> 43:37.100
- The nipple was black
and crusting over.

43:37.100 --> 43:39.700
- You got screwed.
