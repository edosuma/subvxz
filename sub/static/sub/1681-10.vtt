WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:03.250
<i>Why do we fight?</i>

00:03.499 --> 00:05.496
<i>What is that thing
deep with any each of us?</i>

00:05.621 --> 00:08.481
<i>That compels us to settle
disagreements with our fists?</i>

00:08.837 --> 00:11.183
<i>Whatever it is, it's there right
from the beginning.</i>

00:11.308 --> 00:13.530
Okay, okay. Stop fighting!

00:13.772 --> 00:14.606
Why?

00:14.908 --> 00:16.909
Because it's stupid and juvenile.

00:17.161 --> 00:19.414
We're six.
We are stupid and juvenile.

00:23.101 --> 00:25.566
<i>Kids, I've only been
in one fight in my life.</i>

00:25.691 --> 00:27.737
<i>And this is the story
of how it happened.</i>

00:27.862 --> 00:30.368
<i>Now, as you know,
I recently had been left at the altar.</i>

00:30.494 --> 00:32.613
<i>And the worst thing about
getting left at the altar?</i>

00:32.740 --> 00:35.145
<i>I mean, aside from actually
getting left at the altar,</i>

00:35.270 --> 00:36.669
<i>was what came next.</i>

00:36.794 --> 00:39.862
<i>A steady unrelenting
unbearable stream of pity.</i>

00:40.628 --> 00:42.331
Vodka cranberry. Gin and tonic.

00:45.329 --> 00:46.413
Scotch and soda.

00:48.867 --> 00:49.877
Thank you.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.064
- Could I see a menu?
- Ted,

00:56.301 --> 00:58.222
I'm going to go get you a menu...

00:58.501 --> 00:59.950
but I promise you,

01:00.397 --> 01:01.435
I will come back.

01:05.007 --> 01:07.061
Okay, we have to start
going someplace else.

01:07.488 --> 01:10.625
At this bar, I'm always going to be
the guy who got left at the altar.

01:10.751 --> 01:12.140
That sucks!

01:12.265 --> 01:13.368
<i>Good times.</i>

01:14.269 --> 01:16.006
- We lost Barney.
- What do you mean?

01:16.418 --> 01:18.425
There's a girl over there
in a tight red sweater.

01:18.551 --> 01:21.257
So he's not listening to a word
anyone's saying. Right, Barney?

01:21.506 --> 01:22.749
<i>Give me a break!</i>

01:23.136 --> 01:25.993
See, he figured out a while back
he could fake an entire conversation

01:26.118 --> 01:28.769
just by saying titles of black
sitcoms from the 70's and 80's.

01:29.188 --> 01:31.606
<i>- What's happening?
- Hey, Barney,</i>

01:31.859 --> 01:35.529
want to go upstairs and do stuff to me
that I won't even let Marshall do?

01:36.250 --> 01:37.770
<i>Different strokes.</i>

01:40.257 --> 01:41.577
What the hell is this?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.463
<i>I've told you kids
about Doug, right?</i>

01:43.588 --> 01:45.336
<i>I haven't? Oh, well...</i>

01:45.997 --> 01:48.151
<i>Doug Martin was
a bartender at MacLaren's.</i>

01:48.276 --> 01:49.801
<i>He was always kind of around.</i>

01:50.055 --> 01:53.055
- Have... you met Ted?
- We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"

01:53.224 --> 01:54.368
Am I dead?

01:55.307 --> 01:56.409
Am I dead?

01:56.770 --> 01:57.813
Tonight...

01:58.419 --> 01:59.792
I pick up a lesbian.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.695
<i>Anyway, three things
you need to know about Doug.</i>

02:02.863 --> 02:05.332
<i>The first thing is that Doug
had a bit of a violent streak.</i>

02:05.458 --> 02:07.348
... crumbled,
so he's on the ground, right?

02:07.473 --> 02:10.333
And we're just kicking him!
He's making that face, all shaking.

02:11.668 --> 02:14.296
So, anyway, what we did
was we left him there.

02:15.366 --> 02:16.215
Top you off?

02:17.636 --> 02:20.179
<i>The second thing is that
he was weird about his hair.</i>

02:21.521 --> 02:22.332
What?

02:22.606 --> 02:23.310
What?

02:23.957 --> 02:25.673
Are you looking at my hair?

02:26.356 --> 02:27.858
No, sir. I was not.

02:28.768 --> 02:29.819
It's a toupee.

02:31.525 --> 02:34.034
Is that funny? You want to laugh
it up? Is it funny, guy?

02:35.017 --> 02:36.537
Why don't you grab it?

02:36.706 --> 02:39.022
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead, grab it right off my head.

02:39.147 --> 02:40.143
Go ahead.

02:40.746 --> 02:42.433
You don't want to grab it? Come on.

02:42.758 --> 02:45.301
Come on, go ahead and grab it.
Want to grab it off my head?

02:45.469 --> 02:47.644
Grab my toupee right off my head.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.474
I like you guys!

02:55.434 --> 02:58.232
<i>But the third thing is
that he was very loyal to his regulars.</i>

02:58.357 --> 03:01.325
Hey-hey! There they are!
Hey, you guys want your booth?

03:01.493 --> 03:03.665
- Oh, no. We're fine over here.
- Yeah? Yeah?

03:03.790 --> 03:05.267
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>

03:05.392 --> 03:06.799
No, it's fine, it's fine.

03:06.924 --> 03:09.712
You two lovebirds! Let's take
this somewhere else booth's reserved.

03:11.132 --> 03:13.148
Let's go! Now! Come on!

03:13.273 --> 03:15.007
Let's see some hustle, Father.
Up you get.

03:15.132 --> 03:16.473
Okay, guys, here we are!

03:17.372 --> 03:18.735
<i>So, that's Doug.</i>

03:18.860 --> 03:21.936
- What the hell is this?
- Some guys are sitting in our booth.

03:22.061 --> 03:23.953
But you know what? This is fine.

03:27.516 --> 03:29.186
Let's go, I'll take care of it.

03:29.659 --> 03:31.621
Oh, boy, there he goes.

03:39.068 --> 03:41.431
Ladies, if you'll please
adjourn to your usual booth.

03:41.556 --> 03:43.848
Gentlemen, I will require
your assistance outside.

03:44.155 --> 03:45.142
Our assistance?

03:45.310 --> 03:47.742
We're going to go out in the
alley and fight those guys.

03:48.221 --> 03:49.640
What's happening now?

03:50.359 --> 03:52.715
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.063 --> 04:05.589
I'm sorry, did you just say...

04:05.757 --> 04:08.425
Those guys
are being inconsiderate, okay?

04:08.550 --> 04:11.014
So we're going to go outside
and cave in their skulls, OK?

04:11.454 --> 04:12.707
This will be fun!

04:15.612 --> 04:17.449
He wants us to fight?
Like,

04:17.574 --> 04:19.192
Like, with our hands and stuff?

04:19.620 --> 04:22.233
And feet maybe?
I don't know what the rules are.

04:22.788 --> 04:23.820
A fight.

04:24.419 --> 04:26.120
- Should we go out there?
- Come on,

04:26.288 --> 04:28.395
there's only 3 things
you'll ever see me fight:

04:28.520 --> 04:29.959
the stubborn clasp of a bra,

04:30.709 --> 04:33.080
Sexual harassment charges,
nine for nine,

04:34.884 --> 04:37.381
and the urge to vomit
when I see someone wearing

04:37.506 --> 04:39.697
brown shoes with a black suit.

04:42.150 --> 04:44.799
Dude, fighting is for losers.
We're civilized guys.

04:44.924 --> 04:47.949
Civilized guys don't fight.
Unless it's with lightsabers.

04:48.074 --> 04:49.864
But that's like three
to five years away...

04:50.032 --> 04:53.375
- Well, that's not true.
- Robin, I'm on the forums every day.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.125
Three to five
Thanksgivings from now,

04:55.250 --> 04:57.404
I'm going to be carving
the turkey with Old Green.

04:58.754 --> 05:01.086
No, I'm saying there are
plenty of legitimate reasons

05:01.211 --> 05:03.559
to get in a fight,
it might not be pretty,

05:03.684 --> 05:06.138
but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.018
Right, I forgot.
She thinks fighting's sexy.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.274
No, I do not! A lot...

05:13.055 --> 05:15.083
Look, I come from a culture
of hockey players.

05:15.209 --> 05:18.658
If a guy can throw down,
it's somewhat way hot.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.273
And scars, hello!

05:21.640 --> 05:23.623
If a guy's got a scar,
he's got a Robin.

05:24.084 --> 05:26.465
And if he's missing teeth?
I'm missing my pants.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.301
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.

05:31.189 --> 05:32.788
Outpatient procedure.

05:32.982 --> 05:35.865
Local anesthesia.
Whatever. It ain't a thing.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.325
- Maybe we should go out there.
- I can't believe

05:40.450 --> 05:42.433
we're even having this discussion.

05:42.558 --> 05:45.657
Ted, you're 30,
you're too old to act like this.

05:46.150 --> 05:49.412
<i>I was 30 and in those 30 years
I'd been punched once.</i>

05:49.833 --> 05:51.916
There's a very simple explana...

05:52.569 --> 05:54.111
<i>There was that thing at camp.</i>

05:54.236 --> 05:56.757
Today, we're going to braid
friendship bracelets.

05:58.263 --> 06:00.095
<i>In college, I studied some Kung Fu.</i>

06:06.223 --> 06:07.857
<i>And, there was some other stuff.</i>

06:12.494 --> 06:14.576
The thing with the goat
wasn't for another few months.

06:15.144 --> 06:17.041
The point is,
I had never been in a fight.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.041
- I'm going out there.
- No!

06:19.209 --> 06:22.024
Listen to me, please, trust me,
I've been in plenty of fights.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.209
It's really nothing to be proud of.

06:24.448 --> 06:25.884
Who did you get in a fight with?

06:26.828 --> 06:28.060
My brothers.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.895
Yes, I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rumpus room.

06:34.438 --> 06:36.066
I love brotherly horseplay!

06:36.234 --> 06:39.343
- Here comes the tickle monster!
- Noogie patrol!

06:40.663 --> 06:42.451
Wait, wait, wait!
Timesies! Timesies!

06:43.910 --> 06:44.953
Cocoa break.

06:48.785 --> 06:49.753
Cocoa break.

06:51.873 --> 06:53.677
Okay, it's clobbering time.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.607
Ted, don't do this,
you're a nice guy.

06:56.732 --> 06:59.257
- That's your best quality.
- Is it?

06:59.382 --> 07:01.120
'Cause I seem
to rember this nice guy

07:01.246 --> 07:03.687
getting dumped by his fiancÃ©e
for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.

07:04.235 --> 07:05.750
This may sound crazy, but I...

07:05.875 --> 07:09.576
I think I need to do this. I think
this is an experience I need to have.

07:10.703 --> 07:11.557
I'm going.

07:15.679 --> 07:16.753
Me, too!

07:19.247 --> 07:20.090
Guys...

07:20.718 --> 07:23.402
take a good look at this face,
because the next time you see it,

07:23.527 --> 07:26.476
it will be disfigured
in the hottest possible way.

07:27.356 --> 07:29.744
Because that's who I am, I'm a man.

07:30.462 --> 07:33.487
I like to fight and mix it up
and get all dirty.

07:35.282 --> 07:37.460
Can you find a wood hanger for this?

07:41.793 --> 07:43.961
- What happened here?
- I know, right?

07:44.538 --> 07:46.672
Who's not looking at my toupee now?

07:46.915 --> 07:48.343
Look what we did to these guys!

07:48.511 --> 07:50.017
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we".

07:50.142 --> 07:52.049
Come on, man, we're a good team.

07:52.257 --> 07:53.851
Nice work boys! We did it!

07:54.019 --> 07:56.355
No, no, you did it.
We didn't do anything.

07:57.648 --> 08:00.417
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure,
I just beat up three guys by myself.

08:01.258 --> 08:02.485
You guys. That's good.

08:02.794 --> 08:04.022
You and you

08:05.636 --> 08:07.080
free drinks for life.

08:11.853 --> 08:13.768
He thinks we were
in this fight with him.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.550
We were in this fight with him.

08:16.421 --> 08:18.555
Now we are going to go
in there and tell everyone

08:18.723 --> 08:21.392
the legendary tale of how
we beat up some guys.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.480
And everyone is going
to think it's great

08:23.605 --> 08:25.434
and everyone is going to
sleep with me again.

08:25.559 --> 08:28.653
Dude, come on, no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight, look at us.

08:28.821 --> 08:30.281
Oh, that's a good...

08:31.449 --> 08:32.576
What are you doing?

08:32.744 --> 08:34.442
What I should've done
a long time ago.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.832
- What?
- I just hit myself in the eye!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.033
I don't even know what I'm saying!

08:40.255 --> 08:42.090
I throw an awesome right hook,
by the way.

08:42.405 --> 08:44.010
- Are you ready?
- To go back in?

08:44.331 --> 08:45.262
No, for this.

08:48.477 --> 08:49.935
You punched me in the nose!

08:50.264 --> 08:52.169
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying!

08:52.294 --> 08:54.227
You just punched me in the nose!

08:54.648 --> 08:57.340
That's going to swell up real good.
You're going to look like Owen Wilson.

08:57.465 --> 08:58.803
Let's get back in there.

08:58.928 --> 09:01.286
Okay, but just, let's just
play this down, okay?

09:01.454 --> 09:03.656
I don't want this
to turn into a big thing.

09:04.626 --> 09:06.394
And Ted comes
and takes his shoe off!

09:06.519 --> 09:08.212
Hits him in the mouth...

09:08.380 --> 09:10.598
Hey, there they are!
The guys that got my back!

09:23.654 --> 09:25.113
You two got in a fight.

09:25.770 --> 09:26.580
Really?

09:26.705 --> 09:29.047
No, Barney punched me
and himself in the face

09:29.172 --> 09:31.623
to make it look like we got in a fight.
Come on, Marshall!

09:33.801 --> 09:35.062
Look at your eye.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.990
You look like a badass.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.793
I'm surprised to see
you had it in me.

09:39.919 --> 09:41.764
You. Had it in you.

09:43.422 --> 09:44.469
Do you...

09:45.328 --> 09:46.590
want to touch it?

09:50.484 --> 09:51.974
Oh, my God, it's warm!

09:54.291 --> 09:55.810
Hey! Victory drinks!

09:56.779 --> 09:57.659
Free!

09:57.968 --> 09:59.805
Free! Free!

10:00.111 --> 10:01.919
Free!
$7.50.

10:03.332 --> 10:06.152
- Why do I have to pay?
- 'Cause you don't got my back.

10:07.001 --> 10:09.146
- These guys got my back.
- You know what, Doug?

10:09.271 --> 10:12.212
I will gladly pay. And you know why?
Because that's what grownups do.

10:12.337 --> 10:14.753
They pay for their drinks,
and they don't get into fights.

10:15.071 --> 10:17.526
You know what I was doing,
while you were out there being immature?

10:17.651 --> 10:19.528
- I'll tell you what I was doing.
- Your nails?

10:20.636 --> 10:22.496
- I was doing...
- The relationship quiz

10:22.621 --> 10:25.663
- in this month's Cosmo?
- No. I was doing...

10:25.832 --> 10:28.106
Your best not to cry
when Big came back for Carrie

10:28.231 --> 10:30.136
<i>at the end
of the Sex and the City movie?</i>

10:30.261 --> 10:33.467
Spoilers much? No.
I'll tell you what I was doing...

10:33.637 --> 10:36.416
The captain of the football team
because he gave you his promise ring

10:36.541 --> 10:39.726
and you look so pretty in your
open back Homecoming dress?

10:42.290 --> 10:43.291
Sorry.

10:44.765 --> 10:46.146
I hate those guys!

10:46.581 --> 10:49.286
Acting like they're the manliest guys
in the universe, like they're

10:49.411 --> 10:51.745
Crocodile Dundee
and David Hasselhoff.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.373
Those are the manliest guys
in the universe?

10:54.541 --> 10:57.240
I don't understand why they're getting
all this attention. I mean,

10:57.365 --> 11:00.257
- I'm the real hero here.
- Yeah, you are.

11:00.434 --> 11:02.991
I'm serious, woman.
Put it back in your pants.

11:05.379 --> 11:08.222
You're the man every boy
should grow up to become

11:08.346 --> 11:10.179
and every girl should marry.

11:11.474 --> 11:12.641
You know what?

11:12.766 --> 11:15.246
I have 2 kids in my class
who won't stop fighting.

11:15.371 --> 11:18.008
If you come to school tomorrow
and tell them your story

11:18.134 --> 11:21.933
of choosing the path of nonviolence,
it might really set them straight.

11:22.334 --> 11:25.365
And save me having to get up early
to make a lesson plan.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.401
All right.

11:27.633 --> 11:29.798
Okay. I'll set them straight.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.178
You're a wuss.

11:31.557 --> 11:32.884
What? No!

11:33.805 --> 11:36.599
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala
are telling you kids

11:36.724 --> 11:39.608
- this story to illustrate...
- To illustrate that you're a wuss?

11:40.778 --> 11:42.687
Why didn't you just
fight those guys?

11:42.812 --> 11:44.219
Were you scared?

11:44.569 --> 11:45.372
What?

11:47.259 --> 11:48.289
I wasn't scared!

11:49.166 --> 11:52.188
- I've been in plenty of fights, okay?
- You're huge!

11:52.313 --> 11:54.717
You must weigh
like a thousand pounds.

11:56.866 --> 11:58.044
First of all,

11:58.169 --> 12:00.112
I'm wearing a baggy sweater,

12:00.237 --> 12:02.101
and it has horizontal stripes.

12:02.607 --> 12:04.543
And I also...
And I had a salty lunch...

12:04.668 --> 12:06.565
And so I'm retain...
You know what? Shut up!

12:06.734 --> 12:08.319
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

12:15.587 --> 12:16.327
So,

12:16.785 --> 12:18.572
you just beat those guys up?

12:19.160 --> 12:19.994
Just?

12:21.671 --> 12:24.112
Amanda, were it so simple. You see,

12:24.681 --> 12:27.944
hand to hand combat is about
so much more than just administering

12:28.069 --> 12:31.394
- brute force on your opponent, right B?
- You know it!

12:31.564 --> 12:32.764
It's a science.

12:33.497 --> 12:35.734
The sweet science, as it were.

12:35.903 --> 12:38.739
Wait, I'm confused,
what did those guys do to deserve it?

12:40.544 --> 12:41.990
This may sound petty,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.255
- but they sat in our booth.
- They sat in our booth.

12:45.584 --> 12:46.945
- And nobody...
- Nobody.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.672
sits in our booth.

12:52.678 --> 12:54.697
Are you going to beat those guys up?

12:59.167 --> 13:01.963
We are going to beat those guys up.
Ted, come on.

13:05.515 --> 13:07.841
You two. Our booth.

13:07.966 --> 13:09.619
Get out. Now!

13:09.788 --> 13:12.003
- What are you doing?
- Relax, we got Doug.

13:12.128 --> 13:14.446
- Big Doug's got our backs.
- Doug's not here tonight.

13:15.046 --> 13:18.225
Can I get you guys anything? Drinks?
Cash? Those two girls over there?

13:19.193 --> 13:20.427
Are you Ted Mosby?

13:21.838 --> 13:23.975
- I am.
- And you're Barney Stinson?

13:24.798 --> 13:26.185
They've heard of us.

13:26.453 --> 13:27.661
It's cool, guys.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.563
Let you leave
with your asses unkicked.

13:31.048 --> 13:32.140
This time.

13:32.695 --> 13:33.696
A'ight?

13:35.493 --> 13:38.120
- What's... What's this?
- You've been served.

13:38.289 --> 13:40.249
You're being sued for assault.

13:40.776 --> 13:41.918
Enjoy your booth.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.413
That was close.

13:53.681 --> 13:56.356
Assault!
They're suing us for assault!

13:56.526 --> 13:59.612
What's the penalty for assault?
What, do I have to pay a fine?

14:00.235 --> 14:03.701
Pick up trash on the highway? 'Cause
I've done that before, know what I mean?

14:04.507 --> 14:06.840
<i>- I don't know.
- Actually, he did know</i>

14:06.965 --> 14:09.386
<i>that the worst we were looking at
was a small civil settlement,</i>

14:09.511 --> 14:11.183
<i>and probably no criminal charges.</i>

14:11.308 --> 14:12.950
<i>But he was really pissed at us.</i>

14:13.075 --> 14:15.956
I mean, you guys could be looking at
some serious prison time.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.474
- Prison?
- I can't go to prison!

14:19.015 --> 14:22.660
I could get a lot of reading done,
finally write some short stories.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.445
Work out all the time.
Seriously, if I don't come out

14:25.570 --> 14:28.406
- of there completely ripped...
- Ted, we can't go to prison!

14:29.325 --> 14:31.086
People get shivved in the joint!

14:32.037 --> 14:34.160
Plus the meals are really starchy.

14:35.533 --> 14:38.712
You guys should have thought of that
before you beat up those guys.

14:40.722 --> 14:41.931
What if we didn't?

14:42.284 --> 14:44.164
- Didn't what?
- Didn't beat up those guys.

14:44.289 --> 14:46.975
What if Doug beat up those guys all
by himself and we didn't do anything?

14:47.145 --> 14:49.867
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

14:50.357 --> 14:52.191
You guys didn't throw
a single punch.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.731
Well, I hit Ted and myself,

14:54.856 --> 14:57.325
- so...
- Well, who's the wuss now?

14:57.450 --> 14:59.244
Answer: You guys.

14:59.412 --> 15:01.247
Look, can you just help us
get out of this?

15:01.415 --> 15:04.175
You know the old expression:
If you're not prepared to do the time

15:04.300 --> 15:07.781
don't pretend to do the crime
and laugh and get free drinks

15:07.906 --> 15:10.347
and not stand up for your friend
who, incidentally,

15:10.472 --> 15:13.139
has been in plenty of fights
with his brothers.

15:15.185 --> 15:17.394
Look, you've got to
help us out, Marshall.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.034
We're the Three Musketeers!

15:20.778 --> 15:22.905
If I give up Ted,
how much time am I looking at?

15:28.665 --> 15:30.123
I've been looking for you.

15:31.011 --> 15:34.127
I got tickets to this hockey game
tonight. It's stupid.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.824
You want to go?
It might go kind of late,

15:36.949 --> 15:39.137
so, maybe, after the game
we can grab a drink.

15:39.326 --> 15:40.640
Robin, get this.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.175
You know that fight?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.663
These guys faked the whole thing.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.453
Oh, I forgot! Tonight is no good.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.166
I... I can't go to that hockey
game tonight, I got that...

15:59.657 --> 16:00.586
That...

16:02.344 --> 16:03.257
That...

16:05.659 --> 16:06.626
That...

16:09.288 --> 16:10.134
That...

16:10.846 --> 16:11.903
That...

16:17.400 --> 16:19.658
Good news... I talked to the guys.

16:19.825 --> 16:21.749
- What guys?
- The guys you didn't beat up.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.802
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.

16:24.343 --> 16:26.710
- Lawyered.
- What? They agreed to drop it?

16:26.878 --> 16:29.715
Yeah, I just explained
that you two are wusses.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.807
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh, actually.

16:32.931 --> 16:35.472
I explained how you get
a mani/pedi once a month.

16:36.159 --> 16:38.518
Weekly, Wolverine...
some of us care.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.416
And how you played
the hammer dulcimer

16:41.541 --> 16:44.027
in the Pre-Reformation
Dance Society at Wesleyan.

16:44.385 --> 16:46.125
Did you at least tell them
we were one of

16:46.250 --> 16:48.826
the premier Medieval chamber
groups in the Little Ivies?

16:49.191 --> 16:50.142
Oh, I did.

16:50.267 --> 16:53.320
We all agreed it was much more likely
that one guy beat up the three of them

16:53.445 --> 16:56.108
than that you two had
anything to do with it, so...

16:57.259 --> 16:58.260
Wait, so...

16:58.567 --> 17:00.927
- So now they're only suing Doug.
- Affirmative.

17:01.743 --> 17:03.069
Angry, irrational,

17:04.126 --> 17:05.236
violent Doug,

17:05.362 --> 17:08.451
who now knows we were the ones
who threw him under the bus.

17:09.483 --> 17:10.441
They what?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.127
- Look, Doug, we can explain...
- Explain what?

17:14.778 --> 17:17.576
Explain how you stabbed me
in the back right to my face?

17:17.848 --> 17:20.643
- Robin, I'm scared.
- Yeah, is Doug seeing anyone?

17:21.113 --> 17:23.521
Are you seeing anyone?
You really should.

17:24.298 --> 17:25.909
Look, you don't understand,

17:26.034 --> 17:27.967
you beat up those guys
all by yourself.

17:28.304 --> 17:31.174
It's true, all right?
They had nothing to do with it.

17:32.326 --> 17:33.618
Look at these two.

17:35.231 --> 17:36.721
It was all Ted!

17:38.722 --> 17:40.862
- Look at this guy.
- Yeah, look at me!

17:41.031 --> 17:44.326
- He wouldn't last 5 minutes in a fight.
- I think I could last at least five...

17:44.495 --> 17:46.621
He's got the muscle definition
of linguini.

17:46.798 --> 17:50.074
Yeah, linguini with meatballs maybe...
Check it.

17:51.996 --> 17:53.101
- Look!
- Don't.

17:54.010 --> 17:55.817
Okay, you know what, maybe it was...

17:56.144 --> 17:59.058
just me. Actually, that makes a lot
of sense. I tend to black out a lot.

17:59.602 --> 18:01.919
Anyway, look,
I always got your back.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.673
All I ask in return is
that you got mine. But you know what?

18:06.507 --> 18:07.507
You don't.

18:08.374 --> 18:09.939
You can't be counted on.

18:10.963 --> 18:12.536
No wonder your fiancÃ©e left you.

18:13.622 --> 18:16.596
<i>And here it is, kids,
the only fight I've ever been in.</i>

18:17.051 --> 18:19.436
<i>So what can I share
about the experience?</i>

18:21.741 --> 18:24.678
<i>Well, for starters, when you
punch someone in the face,</i>

18:25.683 --> 18:27.129
<i>it hurts your hand...</i>

18:28.199 --> 18:29.068
<i>a lot.</i>

18:31.358 --> 18:33.150
<i>But what hurts even more than that?</i>

18:34.323 --> 18:35.320
<i>This.</i>

18:36.492 --> 18:39.029
<i>And the next thing
I remember was waking up.</i>

18:39.653 --> 18:42.300
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.541
Turns out getting in a fight
was a terrible idea.

18:47.173 --> 18:48.465
And that's my story.

18:48.814 --> 18:50.510
And what did you learn?

18:51.597 --> 18:54.228
Well, I learned that fighting is bad

18:55.246 --> 18:57.228
and you shouldn't do it ever.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.129
Any questions?

19:01.095 --> 19:04.177
- Where do you find these people?
- I know!

19:04.496 --> 19:06.660
Was there a big sale
at the wuss market?

19:07.003 --> 19:08.930
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

19:09.854 --> 19:12.591
<i>Of course, I didn't tell those kids
what really happened.</i>

19:13.863 --> 19:16.258
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

19:18.587 --> 19:19.703
What happened?

19:20.915 --> 19:22.043
This happened.

19:25.982 --> 19:27.234
Holy crap!

19:27.837 --> 19:29.866
<i>Turns out Uncle Marshall
and his brothers</i>

19:29.991 --> 19:31.980
<i>did a little more
than just roughhouse.</i>

19:38.520 --> 19:39.459
Cocoa break!

19:49.008 --> 19:51.369
Marshall looks good.
Has he lost weight?

19:51.494 --> 19:52.805
Bitch, don't even.

19:54.643 --> 19:56.519
<i>Kids, I'd love to leave you
with the message</i>

19:56.644 --> 19:58.506
<i>that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it,</i>

19:58.631 --> 20:00.210
<i>but I know that's pointless.</i>

20:00.335 --> 20:02.086
<i>So, I'll leave you with this:</i>

20:02.211 --> 20:04.409
<i>don't ever get in a fight
with Uncle Marshall.</i>

20:04.534 --> 20:06.249
<i>That guy's freaking crazy.</i>

20:11.845 --> 20:13.583
It is so good to be home.

20:13.905 --> 20:16.167
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.

20:16.642 --> 20:19.060
"Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat." Right?

20:19.185 --> 20:20.431
Okay, here we go.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.900
Goggles on.

20:27.116 --> 20:29.635
All right, so,
you guys pass the plates.

20:29.761 --> 20:32.234
- Lily, you want white or dark meat?
- Dark!

20:32.460 --> 20:34.208
Honey, please be careful.
