WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:01.600
Can you tell
me what happened

00:01.600 --> 00:03.200
<i>at the end of last
season of Medium?</i>

00:03.200 --> 00:06.800
Oh, it was very...
It was a really nice story.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.300
Joe was held hostage.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.600
There was gunshots.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.800
<i>There were five of us
in that room.</i>

00:12.800 --> 00:15.000
Only two of us
made it out alive.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.300
So he was told by his lawyer
that he could actually sue.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.700
My name is Cooper Conroy.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.400
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
Can you talk for a moment?

00:21.400 --> 00:22.500
Talk about what?

00:22.500 --> 00:26.000
About the millions of dollars
I believe you're entitled to.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.600
What is this? It's a liability waiver.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.400
So you're saying that if

00:29.400 --> 00:31.400
I don't sign these,
I can't come back to work?

00:31.400 --> 00:33.300
Allison was begging
Neve Campbell,

00:33.300 --> 00:36.600
the reporter chick, not to print
the truth about her.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.700
That reporter had to be, like,
a little snitch.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.600
You cannot run this story!
Debra!

00:43.100 --> 00:43.900
Please!

00:44.400 --> 00:45.800
<i>What about
my life?!</i>

00:45.900 --> 00:47.300
My husband's life?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.100
My children's lives?

00:49.100 --> 00:52.100
And now Allison's whole life is
in turmoil and in jeopardy.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.800
Well, the press is after her.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.700
Can you talk about
your relationship

00:54.700 --> 00:57.100
as a spiritual advisor
to the district attorney?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.400
Do you actually
talk to dead people?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.100
Her boss is about this close
to losing his job.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.200
This new D.A. came in,
started cleaning house,

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
and no one seemed to have wanted
Allison's services anymore.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.700
I'd like you all to meet an
old law school buddy of mine,

01:08.700 --> 01:10.600
Tom Van Dyke, Assistant
District Attorney

01:10.600 --> 01:12.300
out of Flagstaff
and a good friend.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.300
<i>Well, I went to work.</i>

01:13.300 --> 01:15.000
<i>No Devalos.
He's just not there.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.000
<i>Turns out his friend
they brought in to help</i>

01:17.000 --> 01:18.300
<i>is suddenly running the place.</i>

01:18.300 --> 01:20.400
<i>He sends an assistant
overto me</i>

01:20.400 --> 01:22.600
to tell me that my part-time
consulting services

01:22.600 --> 01:25.200
probably won't be needed
for the foreseeable future.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.800
Look, I understand
that Manny is in hot water.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.600
I know you're on

01:28.600 --> 01:29.800
thin ice where you are,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.700
but neither of you
takes my calls?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.800
Allison, Manny is on a boat
in the Gulf of Mexico fishing.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.200
And as for you, what do you
want me to say? You're toxic!

01:37.300 --> 01:38.300
Given the way
things are going,

01:38.300 --> 01:40.300
nobody wants to
hear your dreams.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.200
Nobody wants to hear

01:41.200 --> 01:42.600
from Allison Dubois.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.400
Now they both don't have jobs.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
How are they going
to survive?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.900
I don't know
what they're going to do.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
Yeah, I don't know.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.400
Yeah, that makes
no sense to me.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.400
No. We've been
negotiating this deal

01:58.400 --> 01:59.300
for three
and half months.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.800
Now he's insisting
we close it this second?

02:02.300 --> 02:03.700
No. You can't
conference him in right now.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.600
I'm with Ben.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.900
What? Uh, hold on.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.800
I'm losing you.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.200
Yeah. Hold on
a second.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.200
Ben, come here, buddy.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.200
Dad?
Yeah, uh...

02:14.400 --> 02:16.200
Fine. All right,
put him through.

02:17.100 --> 02:17.700
Ben?

02:17.700 --> 02:19.200
Uh, no, no, sorry,
Mr. Rivercott.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.500
Can you just
give me one second, please?

02:24.800 --> 02:26.500
Yes, Mr. Rivercott.
I'm here.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.400
Yes, sir, and I'm ready
to do some business.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.500 --> 02:50.400
Well, if that's all
that's standing

02:50.400 --> 02:52.400
between us and a deal, sir,
I'm sure we can...

02:55.900 --> 02:56.900
Ben?

02:58.300 --> 03:00.000
Ben? Buddy, can you hear me?!

03:01.000 --> 03:01.900
Ben?!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.400
Oh, God. Ben!

03:04.600 --> 03:05.300
Ben?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.500
Ben! Ben!

03:07.500 --> 03:08.300
Ben!

03:08.300 --> 03:09.600
Oh.
Oh.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.900
What?

03:12.900 --> 03:14.300
Did you say
something?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Dream.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.100
A little boy.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.800
A kidnapping, I think.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.800
Oh.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.100
What are you
going to do?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.400
Here. You want
to call someone?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.500
There's no one to call.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.800
Don't you reiember?

03:29.900 --> 03:31.100
Oh, yeah.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.500
I guess for a
minute there,

03:36.400 --> 03:38.100
I was hoping that
was just a dream.

Oh, no, not again.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Ugh!

04:51.900 --> 04:53.900
We really need
to have a boy.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.100
Mm...

04:56.300 --> 04:58.800
And in the forecast-
oudy, windy and cold.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.600
I'm just saying, I
don't think it's fair.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.600
Fair? I don't think
it's about fair.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.500
I mean, if what you're
saying is true, I'm sure

05:05.500 --> 05:06.300
it's just 'cause they
want to know that

05:06.300 --> 05:08.400
whoever they give the lead
role to can handle the pressure

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
and the
responsibility.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.800
Being in a new school

05:10.800 --> 05:14.000
and balancing that
with all the homework.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.300
So you agree?

05:15.400 --> 05:17.500
You think it's just fine that
because I'm in the ninth grade,

05:17.500 --> 05:19.000
and it's my first
year in high school

05:19.100 --> 05:21.200
that I shouldn't play the
lead in the school play?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.100
Even though
it#s the perfect play for me

05:23.100 --> 05:25.800
and it's the perfect role
for me and I'm perfect for it?

05:27.500 --> 05:28.500
Here, babe.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It's no good.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.900
I'm sorry, baby.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.100
That's all the peanut
butter we have left.

05:35.800 --> 05:36.000
Mom,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.100
what do you think?

05:38.700 --> 05:39.400
What do I think?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.500
I think just because all
the other kids are saying

05:41.500 --> 05:44.000
ninth graders never get the
lead doesn't make it so.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.600
I think you ought
to wait to see

05:45.600 --> 05:47.900
that you didn't get the part
before you get all upset.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.100
Great. Just my luck.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.100
<i>When I'm in ninth grade,
they do The Sound of Music.</i>

05:52.100 --> 05:53.200
And then, when I'm in tenth,

05:53.200 --> 05:55.400
<i>they'll do The Wiz or
Dreamgirls. Just watch.</i>

05:55.400 --> 05:57.500
Yeah, it's tough
looking like you.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.200
And now authorities
and the young man's family

06:00.200 --> 06:02.000
are asking for your help.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.000
Oh, no.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.500
A $20,000 reward
is being offered

06:04.500 --> 06:07.700
for any information leading
to the recovery of Ben Goldman,

06:08.100 --> 06:09.200
and both the Chief of Police

06:09.200 --> 06:12.800
and acting District Attorney
Van Dyke have pledged...

06:13.100 --> 06:14.000
D.A.'s Office.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.700
Of course, the election
is still several months away,

06:17.700 --> 06:19.500
and just to put some things
in perspective,

06:19.900 --> 06:23.100
only about 32% of the
eligible electorate

06:23.100 --> 06:25.200
is even aware that there's
going to be an election.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.300
But among those
that are,

06:27.300 --> 06:30.000
slightly more than 70%
recognized your name,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
and about half of them

06:31.200 --> 06:33.500
indicated that
they were favorably disposed

06:33.500 --> 06:34.600
to seeing you continue...

06:34.600 --> 06:35.900
Excuse me a moment.

06:37.900 --> 06:38.400
<i>Can you tell him</i>

06:38.400 --> 06:40.100
it's about the
missing Goldman boy?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.800
I- I think I may
be able to help.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.300
I think I may
know some things.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.300
As soon as he returns

06:44.300 --> 06:46.000
to the office,
I'll give him the message.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.400
And you have
all my num...?

06:51.700 --> 06:52.700
<i>Boy and girls?</i>

06:53.100 --> 06:54.300
Okay, I need
everyone's attention,

06:54.300 --> 06:56.700
because today
we have a special guest.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.200
So our mouths are closed
and our eyes and ears are open.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.300
And now-
and this is pretty exciting-

07:03.400 --> 07:08.100
I'm going to introduce
a real, live police detective.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.100
From our very own Phoenix
Police Force, let's welcome

07:11.100 --> 07:12.300
Detective...

07:12.300 --> 07:14.600
Is it, uh, Scanlawn?

07:25.300 --> 07:26.200
Scanlon.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.400
I feel like
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.500
Who am I speaking with?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.800
It's Allison.
It's Allison Dubois.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.100
Uh, please don't hang up.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.900
I know you're not supposed
to take my calls.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.500
I know I'm persona non grata.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.300
Allison, we've been
through this.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.500
I had a dream
about the Goldman boy.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.900
I called the District Attorney's
Office.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.400
I left Van Dyke a message.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.200
I know he's never going
to call me back.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.000
I called the Phoenix P.D.
I can't get a detective

07:50.000 --> 07:51.100
to take my call.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.700
I don't know what to tell you.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.000
Well, I have to do something.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.500
I can't see what I see,
know what I know,

07:58.100 --> 08:01.200
and not do anything with it,
not tell anyone.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.200
I can't go buy peanut butter and
pretend that I didn't see it.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.800
Allison, they've got me doing
public relations now.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.700
I'm about the furthest thing

08:08.700 --> 08:10.600
there is
from a homicide detective.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.900
You are the closest thing
to a homicide detective I know.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.500
Tell me what you saw.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.200
It happened in a toy store.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
They already know that.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.700
He used a doll, a marionette,

08:24.700 --> 08:26.200
to lure the boy.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.500
Allison, none
of this stuff matters.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.600
It has to matter.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
Why would I see it?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.100
Why would someone bother

08:32.100 --> 08:34.000
to show it to me
if it didn't matter?

08:34.100 --> 08:35.299
Did you see him?

08:35.900 --> 08:38.100
Did you see the man
who took the boy?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.700
Not from the front.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.200
He was wearing a...
green jacket.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.500
A green denim jacket.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.200
All right, fine. Green denim.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.900
I'll tell someone.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.400
Whether they listen,
whether they care-

08:51.500 --> 08:52.800
I can't control that.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.100
Hi.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.300
Have a seat.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.700
Last time you applied
for unemployment benefits?

09:10.700 --> 09:11.300
God.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.800
Uh, sometime in the eighties.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.800
Hmm.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.900
Um...

09:17.500 --> 09:18.500
Engineer?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.500
Aerospace.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.400
So, um, what are we
doing to find work?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.800
I'm sending out
letters of inquiry.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.800
I'm, you know, calling friends
and going to conferences.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.000
It's tough because

09:33.000 --> 09:35.100
there are really only
two other aerospace companies

09:35.100 --> 09:36.500
in the area that do the work
in the fields

09:36.500 --> 09:38.300
that I specialize in, so it's...

09:38.600 --> 09:40.200
I got three kids in school,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
so we-we really don't want
to leave the area.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.700
You're in a
tough spot.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.300
Made good
money, too.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.900
Never see it
coming, do you?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.000
"Dubois. "

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Oh, my goodness.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.700
Dubois?

09:59.100 --> 10:00.200
I take that back.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.700
Maybe you did
see it coming.

10:02.900 --> 10:03.700
I mean,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.600
maybe your
wife did anyway.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.300
$111.80.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.700
All right. Thanks.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.700
Oh, ma'am, that
card's being denied.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.800
Do you have
another card?

10:21.900 --> 10:23.800
No, I-I don't need another card.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.400
There's a mistake.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.100
I know this card's good.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.100
I just paid the bill
a couple weeks ago.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.900
Is there a problem?
I have things I need to do.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.700
There's no problem.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.000
We're just
sorting something out here.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.400
Okay, ma'am, that card's just
going to keep being denied.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.200
And if you swipe
it one more time,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.400
I'm just going to get a message
to take it away from you.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.400
You got cash?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.500
Well, not enough
for all this stuff.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.300
Okay.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.100
All right, let's just figure
out what you really need, okay?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.500
<i>My name? Rolen.</i>

11:25.000 --> 11:26.300
Allison Rolen.

11:26.800 --> 11:33.300
Uh, I think I may have
some information ???

11:36.200 --> 11:37.800
$240 a week.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.800
You work for the same
company 15 years.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.400
The government takes thousands
of dollars every month,

11:44.100 --> 11:45.400
and then when you get fired,

11:45.600 --> 11:48.300
when you can't get work,
they give you $240 a week.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.200
And act like you really ought
to be ashamed of yourself

11:50.200 --> 11:51.600
for even asking for it.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.400
The guy at the
unemployment office

11:56.400 --> 11:58.100
recognized our last name.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.200
He knew about you.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.300
Oh...

12:02.400 --> 12:04.800
Maybe I should take
Marie out of preschool.

12:05.900 --> 12:06.900
I'm home now.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.500
It's not like
she has to be there.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
No, don't do that.
We're not there yet.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.800
Hell, haven't you
been listening?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.700
I just got us $240 a week
to blow on anything we want.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.400
Oh.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.000
* You see I go by the code
Of the doctor of the mix *

12:27.000 --> 12:28.700
* These reasons
I'll tell ya why *

12:28.800 --> 12:31.000
* You see I'm six foot one
I'm tons of fun *

12:31.100 --> 12:33.000
* And I dress to a "T"

12:33.200 --> 12:35.600
* You see I got more clothes
than Muhammad Ali *

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
* And I dress so viciously *

12:37.600 --> 12:39.900
* I got bodyguards,
I got two big cars *

12:39.900 --> 12:41.800
* That definitely
ain't the whack *

12:41.800 --> 12:46.200
* I got a Lincoln Continental
and a sunroof Cadillac *

12:46.300 --> 12:48.600
* So after school,
I take a dip in the pool *

12:48.600 --> 12:50.400
* Which is really on the wall *

12:50.700 --> 12:54.400
* I got a color TV so I can see
the Knicks play basketball *

12:54.400 --> 12:56.000
* Hear me talk about checkbook

12:56.000 --> 12:57.300
* Credit card, more money... *

13:00.700 --> 13:02.000
Hey, what is it?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
Why are you
breathing so hard?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.800
What'd you see, hmm?

13:10.500 --> 13:11.600
He's white.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.200
Or at least
his feet are white.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.800
What I think he's doing
to that little boy...

13:22.100 --> 13:23.500
Is there anyone to call?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.600
Is there anything to do?

13:25.600 --> 13:26.700
No.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.800
SCANLON
What's that, Bobby, a joint?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.800
Two wrongs don't
make a right, Bobby.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.200
I know, they make a left.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.900
Just say "no. "

13:46.600 --> 13:47.500
Eat me, stupid.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.200
Haven't you heard?
Drugs are bad.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.300
Puppets.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.300
They, uh...

14:00.400 --> 14:02.600
they want me to try
'em with the older kids.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.400
Third graders.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.600
I hate my life.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.100
You're still a detective.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.600
What are you talking about?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.700
What it says on my badge?

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
No. Yes.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.500
If you think you know something,
if you think you can help...

14:18.500 --> 14:21.000
I don't know anything.
But you said Allison Dubois

14:21.000 --> 14:23.100
called you with... With nonsense,
with nothing that matters.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.800
She told me that it
happened in a toy store.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.100
The father told us it
happened in a toy store.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
Said the guy was wearing
a green denim jacket.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.400
Besides, I'm on Romper
Room duty. It's not my case.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.500
Make it your case.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.800
Go to the store.
Look around.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.500
Flash your badge.
Talk tg people.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.600
You're not listening.
I'm on the Reefer Madness tour.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.700
<i>You're not listening,
after hours.</i>

14:42.100 --> 14:43.300
Look at the crime
scene photos.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.600
Go see the family.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.900
People don't get irate
because there are

14:45.900 --> 14:47.600
too many cops asking questions.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.900
Tell them the mayor's
office sent you.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.100
<i>Tell them I sent you.</i>

14:54.100 --> 14:55.600
You don't get it.
This new D.A...

14:55.600 --> 14:57.400
Let me handle the new D.A.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
*... six foot one
And I'm tons of fun *

15:02.400 --> 15:04.400
* And I dress to a "T" *

15:04.400 --> 15:07.000
* You see I got more clothes
than Muhammad Ali *

15:07.000 --> 15:08.900
* And I dress so viciously *

15:08.900 --> 15:10.100
* I got bodyguards *

15:10.100 --> 15:11.900
* I got two big cars
that definitely *

15:11.900 --> 15:13.100
* Ain't the whack *

15:13.400 --> 15:15.700
* I got a Lincoln Continental
and... *

15:21.300 --> 15:22.100
Hello?

15:22.500 --> 15:23.600
WOMAN
Allison Rolen?

15:24.400 --> 15:27.700
I'm... sorry,
may I ask who's calling?

15:27.700 --> 15:29.000
This is Ameritips.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.300
You called our 800 number
and left us some

15:31.300 --> 15:33.500
information about ???

15:33.600 --> 15:34.700
I'm following up.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.200
My name is Cynthia Keener.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.300
Uh, right, um...

15:40.300 --> 15:41.600
What can I do for you?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.000
Actually, I was wondering
if we could meet.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.600
You could come
to our Phoenix office,

15:46.600 --> 15:48.400
or I could come to your home.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.200
Do we really have to meet?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.100
Well, I do need to follow up.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.300
I guess it really depends
if you're serious.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.000
Serious about the information
you gave us.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.500
Serious about the reward.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Uh, right, the reward.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.700
I completely forgot.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.400
I really don't feel comfortable
meeting at my home.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.800
You know the Scottsdale Fashion
Square Mall?

16:11.300 --> 16:13.000
How about we meet
in the food court?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.800
Say tomorrow at 11:00?

16:15.800 --> 16:16.700
Okay.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.900
How will I recognize you?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.900
Don't worry, I'll find you.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.900
That's what I do for a living.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.900
Hey, girls!

16:27.900 --> 16:29.400
Come on, hurry up!

16:29.700 --> 16:31.500
Daddy's going to pick up Marie

16:31.500 --> 16:33.000
and Bridgette
and meet us at home.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.700
Hannah, honey, do you
need a ride home?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.300
Oh, my God!
I got called back

16:36.300 --> 16:37.700
for Maria this afternoon!

16:38.100 --> 16:39.600
Oh, my God!
I know!

16:53.700 --> 16:54.500
Hey.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
You nervous?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.000
Terrified.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.500
Look at her.

17:03.000 --> 17:03.900
Brooke Greene?

17:04.099 --> 17:05.099
I know her.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.599
Yeah, well...

17:06.900 --> 17:09.300
she's in the tenth grade,
and I hear she's amazing.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.599
She's perfect for this.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.300
I don't stand a chance.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.099
Hey, the idea is to psych
her out, not yourself.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.000
Never mind.

17:25.099 --> 17:26.300
Hey, Brooke.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.300
Hi, Hannah.
What's going on?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.300
I just...

17:31.300 --> 17:32.600
I know you're going
out there in a minute,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.300
and I don't want you
to get rattled.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.300
Rattled bx what?

17:37.300 --> 17:38.800
Ariel's mother
is out there.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.300
Okay.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.700
And you know who
she is, right?

17:45.700 --> 17:46.500
Yeah.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.500
Well, she's Ariel's mother.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.900
And the thing is,
she already knows

17:57.900 --> 17:59.300
her daughter's
getting the part.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.400
I mean, that's why
she's sitting out there.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.000
I just...

18:04.600 --> 18:06.800
I didn't want you to see her
and have it mess you up.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.300
Brooke Greene? You're on.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.000
Thing is, we just closed,
and it's pouring out.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.100
Couldn't we do this
another time?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
I mean, come on,
you guys were here

18:21.500 --> 18:23.700
for two days. My
employees are still crying

18:23.700 --> 18:25.200
about all the
wages they lost.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, well,
the store's closed now,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.400
and no one's losing a dime.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.900
How about you just
take 20 minutes

18:29.900 --> 18:31.100
and walk me through it?

18:35.200 --> 18:36.200
What's in this direction?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.900
Two bathroom doors, both locked,

18:38.100 --> 18:39.600
employees lounge and lockers,

18:39.600 --> 18:41.800
warehouse space
for additional inventory.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.500
Other cops already
been through it twice.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.500
Yeah, well,
you know what they say.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.500
Third time's a charm.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.100
Who do you say
you work for again?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.100
The Mayor?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.200
That's what I said.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
I hate him.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.000
Oh, don't tell me
we have a leak.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.700
I just had this damn roof
re-tarred a month ago.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.900
You use red tar?

19:10.500 --> 19:11.200
What are you talking about?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.100
What's above us?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.600
Toys, what do you think?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.600
Who's up here?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.700
Someone's up here!
It's the mice.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.400
When it rains
they come inside.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.700
It's the mice.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Am I above the spot
where that drop hit me?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.800
You gotta go
towards the rail.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
Hey, hey, take it
easy up there!

19:58.800 --> 20:00.600
I gotta sell that stuff.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.400
He's not here.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.600
Is he?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.900
What are you
talking about? Who?

20:28.900 --> 20:30.100
I don't know.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.300
I think I was asleep.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.200
Then I felt it.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.000
His head on my chest.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.300
He was lying on top of me.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.800
And it was so real.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.200
I mean, I...

20:55.700 --> 20:57.800
I could smell his hair.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.500
Why doesn't someone call?

21:04.400 --> 21:05.900
Ask for ransom?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.600
Or the the police?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.500
Why don't the police call?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.800
Someone.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.100
I think he's gone.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.600
I think he just came to me...

21:28.900 --> 21:31.200
said "good-bye. "

21:31.700 --> 21:34.200
I think that's what it was.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.100
What? What is it?

21:38.800 --> 21:39.400
He's dead.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.500
I think the little
Goldman boy is dead.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.300
No... I don't
think so, honey.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.200
I just got into bed.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.500
I just got done
watching the news.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.800
They didn't say
a word about it.

21:48.900 --> 21:49.700
What are you
talking about?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.400
It's the middle
of the night.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.200
No, Allison, it's 11:45.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.000
You went to bed
just after 10:00.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.500
I stayed up to
watch the news.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.500
I'm telling you.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.200
Who you calling?

22:00.300 --> 22:01.600
I'm calling Scanlon.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
Maybe he knows something.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.200
Hello?!

22:11.600 --> 22:13.500
I'd like to speak
with the officer in charge.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.400
Hello?!

22:19.600 --> 22:22.400
Would someone point me towards
the lead detective, please?

22:27.300 --> 22:28.500
That would be me.

22:32.900 --> 22:33.600
You?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.900
You found the boy?

22:39.000 --> 22:39.700
I was unaware

22:39.700 --> 22:42.300
that you were even assigned
to this case, Detective.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.500
Some friends in
the mayor's office

22:43.500 --> 22:44.900
asked me to look into it.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.800
Kind of like an
after school project.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.200
Who knows?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.800
Who else knows about this?

22:55.100 --> 22:56.700
Just me and the
store manager.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.900
Coroner's on his way.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.900
Other than that...

23:01.200 --> 23:02.900
You haven't spoken
to any press?

23:03.600 --> 23:04.500
I called your office,

23:04.500 --> 23:05.800
the District
Attorney's Office.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.900
That's the protocol.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.100
That's what I did.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.900
This boy's parents
are in a lot of pain.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.100
I'd like to try to
keep this under wraps

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
for another 12 hours or so,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.700
at least until the
coroner and forensics

23:23.700 --> 23:25.100
have had a chance
to take a look.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.100
Maybe generate some clues,

23:27.800 --> 23:30.100
get us closer to the
animal who did this.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
I think that would make
this a much easier pill

23:33.400 --> 23:34.800
for the parents to swallow.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.500
For everyone to swallow.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.600
Certainly make
for a better story in the press.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.200
Can I count on your
discretion, Detective?

23:44.200 --> 23:45.300
Can I sleep on it?

23:45.300 --> 23:47.900
No. Not unless you plan
on sleeping alone.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.900
Let's keep your
girlfriend out of this.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.600
I'm tired mf her calls
on your behalf.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.200
I need to know if
I can count on you.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.300
I don't know what to tell you.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.900
It's after midnight and I have
to get up in five hours

24:00.900 --> 24:02.700
to talk to a group
of student crossing guards

24:02.700 --> 24:04.900
about the importance
of walking on the green

24:05.500 --> 24:06.700
and not in between.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.200
Really?

24:10.500 --> 24:12.100
I'm sure I could
find somebody else

24:12.100 --> 24:13.400
to take care of
that for you.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.300
A valuable man like you, you
should be out in the field.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
A valuable man like you

24:18.400 --> 24:22.100
should be leading
investigations for my office.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.700
It's not here.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.700
What's not there?

24:30.900 --> 24:32.700
Something I was
sure would be.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.800
<i>So now you're
the star of the play?</i>

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
It's high school.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.900
There are no stars, but...
I'm the lead.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.000
Cool.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.500
Do you know where Daddy is?

24:43.800 --> 24:45.100
No, I agree with you, Mom.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.100
Yes.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.900
No, I agree with Oprah.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.800
In a civilized society,
women should wear underwear,

24:52.400 --> 24:54.200
particularly
if they're public figures,

24:54.200 --> 24:55.900
getting out of cars,
being photographed.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
Mom...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah, Mom... Mom. Mom.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.800
I need to borrow some money.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.300
<i>Allison Rolen?</i>

25:11.700 --> 25:13.100
Have I made a mistake?

25:14.500 --> 25:15.400
Cynthia Keener.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.600
Ameritips.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.500
Allison?
Hi.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.500
I thought I was going
to meet you ten minutes

25:20.500 --> 25:21.500
at the food court.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.300
Oh, I just, well, um...

25:23.300 --> 25:25.500
I was early,
and I saw you standing there.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.800
At Least I thought it was you
standing there.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.900
I'm kind of intuitive that way.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.600
Is-is this all right?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.400
I'd be happy to wait till 11:00.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.000
Oh, this is fine,
this is fine.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.500
I know it sounds so ancient,
but I wanted to be a nun.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.200
You just don't hear that
anymore, but I did.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.900
I wanted to wear a habit

25:47.000 --> 25:50.700
and sit in the front row
Christmas mass,

25:50.700 --> 25:52.800
get mentioned in
Father's sermons.

25:53.600 --> 25:59.100
So I took temporary vows of
poverty, celibacy and obedience.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.500
And I don't know what happened
to the vows of poverty

26:01.500 --> 26:04.000
and celibacy,
but it soon became very evident

26:04.000 --> 26:07.200
that I had no talent whatsoever
for obedience.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.600
So, then I decided to go
into the family business,

26:11.600 --> 26:12.900
become a cop.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.800
I went to college,
I studied criminology.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.100
Me, too.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.500
Back then, for a woman,

26:21.400 --> 26:22.500
it was... tough.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.100
Anyway, I saw an
ad for Ameritips.

26:26.100 --> 26:30.100
And I've been an investigator
with them for 20 years.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.600
And I got my wish-

26:32.200 --> 26:33.700
I'm poor, I'm celibate,

26:34.400 --> 26:36.300
and I don't have to
listen to anyone.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.000
How many people phoned in
about the Goldman boy?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.600
We logged about 1,400 calls.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.500
1,400 calls?

26:46.600 --> 26:48.200
Most of those
are cranks

26:48.600 --> 26:51.400
and others are people fishing
for the reward money.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.400
The credible ones
really jump out at you,

26:56.000 --> 26:57.300
which is why I'm here.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.300
"Green, denim jacket. "

27:01.800 --> 27:03.900
That's rather
specific, isn't it?

27:04.600 --> 27:06.000
Of course, it's not
the kind of clue

27:06.000 --> 27:07.700
that's going to
get you a reward.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.900
Oh, I don't care
about the reward.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.300
I don't care about the money.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.200
The money would be good-
it would be great- but...

27:15.500 --> 27:17.800
I really can't get
that little boy out of my mind.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.400
I know what you mean.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.900
This is a ground floor
plan of the toy store

27:24.900 --> 27:27.000
where the Goldman
boy was abducted.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.600
I wonder if you
wouldn't mind

27:28.600 --> 27:30.900
indicating with the
cursor where you were

27:30.900 --> 27:33.100
when you saw the
man take him.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.300
What do you mean?

27:35.900 --> 27:38.100
Well, the "X" here
is where Mr. Goldman said

27:38.100 --> 27:41.000
his son was standing
the last time he saw him.

27:41.500 --> 27:45.700
And this green "X" here
is the position of the father.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.900
Where would you have been?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.500
I mean, you would have had
to have been fairly close

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
to see that the jacket
was denim.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.700
Were you in the store at all,
Allison?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.600
Enjoy your iced tea.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.700
You should Google me.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.800
My married name is Dubois.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.900
Allison Dubois.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.800
D- U-B-O-I-S.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.200
I know what I'm talking about.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.400
The jacket is green.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.500
And the man who took him?

28:36.700 --> 28:37.600
He likes to dance.

28:37.700 --> 28:38.700
And...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I think the little boy is dead.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.100
You think the
little boy is dead?

28:46.800 --> 28:47.900
Well, I work for the parents,

28:47.900 --> 28:50.500
and I think I would know
if the little boy is dead.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.900
I think you're one of the
cruelest people I've ever met.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.500
Well, I'm not trying to be.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
I saw his spirit
visit his parents last night.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.700
You saw?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.100
Look me up.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.700
It's on your computer.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Right there
for all the world to see.

29:18.600 --> 29:22.600
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.300
Bridge.

29:23.300 --> 29:26.100
Catch a tiger by the toe.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.200
I know what I want for
Christmas. If he hollers...

29:28.200 --> 29:29.500
I want my own room.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.200
...let him go.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.400
What are you doing?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.500
Choosing who's going
to take me to school.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.100
Well, now that you guys
don't have to be anywhere

29:40.100 --> 29:41.200
in the morning...

29:42.400 --> 29:43.400
I miss work.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.300
Me, too.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.500
<i>What do you mean</i>

29:45.500 --> 29:47.200
there's no evidence, Detective?

29:47.200 --> 29:49.900
This, this little boy's body
is covered with evidence.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.200
He is drenched in blood.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.100
Was he shot? Was he stabbed?

29:53.100 --> 29:54.300
Poisoned.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.500
Forced to ingest something-
we don't know what yet-

29:56.700 --> 29:59.500
that very rapidly brought
on massive dehydration,

29:59.500 --> 30:01.600
all the fluid in his
body is just gone.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.100
The skin tissue is nothing
but a hard crust.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.900
The blood you see there
came from his eyes,

30:05.900 --> 30:07.800
his nose, his mouth,
and his anus.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.300
That's enough, Detective.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.800
We're gonna begin
reinterviewing

30:14.800 --> 30:16.600
all the store employees
this morning.

30:16.700 --> 30:17.900
I'm hoping
that fairly soon

30:17.900 --> 30:20.100
the lab will be able to tell us
the exact nature of the poison.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.900
That should certainly help
point us towards

30:21.900 --> 30:23.400
whoever might have done this.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.500
I don't think we can keep
a lid on it much longer.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.100
I know you're not looking
forward to calling the parents.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.700
I'm just afraid if we don't...

30:31.600 --> 30:34.000
Too many people are aware-
cops, lab technicians-

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
for the media not to find out.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.100
We don't have a single clue?

30:40.300 --> 30:43.000
We don't have a single lead
on who this might be?

30:44.100 --> 30:46.000
Well, there is one, but it's...

30:46.600 --> 30:48.100
not much to hang your hat on.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.400
I'm not even sure
if it's credible.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.100
I need something for the press.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.900
He may have been wearing
a green, denim jacket.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.100
You found a fiber?

31:02.100 --> 31:03.900
Allison Dubois had a dream.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.100
Sir?

31:11.200 --> 31:13.200
I'll, uh, call the parents,

31:13.200 --> 31:15.500
I'll notify the media
the boy is dead.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.100
There are no leads
at the present time.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.900
<i>This shocking news just in.</i>

31:20.900 --> 31:24.100
The Coroner's office confirming
that the body of Ben Goldman,

31:24.300 --> 31:26.900
that young boy reported missing
since last week,

31:26.900 --> 31:30.300
was apparently discovered by
authorities sometime yesterday.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.800
Details of the discovery are not
being shared with reporters,

31:33.900 --> 31:36.100
nor is there
any press conference scheduled

31:36.100 --> 31:37.200
at this time.

31:40.500 --> 31:45.000
* I need someone *

31:45.800 --> 31:49.400
* Older and wiser

31:50.300 --> 31:56.600
* Telling me what to do

31:57.500 --> 32:01.900
* You are 17

32:02.900 --> 32:06.600
* Going on 18 *

32:07.900 --> 32:11.400
* I'll *

32:12.200 --> 32:16.400
* Depend *

32:18.200 --> 32:23.500
* On you. *

32:33.600 --> 32:35.100
I could never do that.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.500
What are you talking about?

32:38.900 --> 32:40.200
You have the part.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah...

32:42.000 --> 32:45.100
but nobody was more surprised
than I was when it happened.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.600
I was sure
it was going to be you.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.100
What?

32:50.700 --> 32:52.300
Your mother didn't tell you?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.400
Tell me what?

32:55.500 --> 32:56.400
She seemed to think
you knew.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.800
She seemed to think
you dreamt it

32:57.800 --> 32:58.900
and made it so.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.700
There was no use
in even trying...

33:01.900 --> 33:02.900
Well, I didn't dream it.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.000
The first I heard about you
being called back was

33:05.000 --> 33:05.900
when you told me.

33:05.900 --> 33:06.900
The first...

33:07.100 --> 33:08.700
I heard about you
getting the part was

33:08.700 --> 33:09.900
when you got it.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.200
Mom, this girl
is Maria.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.400
Hi, Mom.

33:14.100 --> 33:14.800
Hey!

33:14.800 --> 33:16.700
I thought you guys were
here the whole time.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.800
Daddy let us play
at the park

33:18.800 --> 33:21.800
until the Police came
and kicked us out!

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
Turns out the place closes
at dark,

33:24.500 --> 33:26.800
which makes no sense to me.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.400
Where are High School kids
supposed to go

33:28.400 --> 33:30.100
and do the things
they can't do at home

33:30.200 --> 33:31.400
if the park is closed?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.300
Dad!

33:33.200 --> 33:34.400
Did you grab the mail?

33:34.900 --> 33:36.000
Yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.200
Why, you expecting
something?

33:37.300 --> 33:39.100
I thought maybe
Mom... Grandma...

33:39.100 --> 33:40.600
might have sent
me something.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.000
Oh, what?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.200
Joe?

33:48.300 --> 33:49.700
I asked her
for a loan.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.500
I tried to
convince her

33:52.500 --> 33:54.000
it was gonna be cheaper
than bail.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.700
Oh, Joe...

33:58.000 --> 33:59.800
She said she was gonna
think about it.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.000
Talk to her
accountant.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.100
I guess I was just
kind of hoping

34:05.100 --> 34:07.100
that her answer would
be in the mail.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.800
It's the mice.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.300
When it rains
they come inside.

34:13.300 --> 34:14.300
It's the mice!

34:16.500 --> 34:18.600
Am I above the spot
where that drop hit me?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.100
You gotta go
towards the rail.

34:31.699 --> 34:32.100
Hey, hey!

34:32.100 --> 34:33.199
Take it easy
up there!

34:33.199 --> 34:34.800
I gotta sell
that stuff!

34:49.199 --> 34:50.900
Come on, pick up your phone.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.100
Allison, it's
barely 6:00.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.500
He's probably
sleeping.

34:57.900 --> 34:58.900
The nut.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.200
I don't know.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.500
He's not taking my calls lately.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.100
He hasn't been returning
them either.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.000
Hi. This is
Detective Lee Scanlon.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.800
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.500
I mean, what is it
that you want him to say?

35:09.500 --> 35:10.900
What is it that you
want him to tell you?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.900
I mean, you dreamt
the boy was a mouse.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.400
But clearly... he's not a mouse.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.200
Well... it means something.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.700
Who you calling now?

35:22.000 --> 35:22.900
DiNovi.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.600
Lynn? It's Allison.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.300
I need to speak
to him.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.600
Um, he's not here.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.200
Yeah, he left a half hour ago.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.700
He's at the toy store.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.300
They're reinterviewing
all the employees

35:34.300 --> 35:35.800
before the place opens
this morning.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.800
You want the address?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.900
Now the last time
you spoke to police

35:39.900 --> 35:42.000
you mentioned that you
do open the store

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Mondays and
Thursdays

35:43.000 --> 35:44.500
and that therefore
you do have a key.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.900
Is that correct Mr...

35:46.700 --> 35:47.700
Mr. Kaye?

35:48.900 --> 35:50.400
There's a lady here
to see you.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.700
Detective,

35:55.100 --> 35:56.600
I'm Cynthia Keener.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.900
I'm an investigator
with Ameritips.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.100
Well...

36:05.100 --> 36:06.100
you're here early.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.000
Didn't expect to see you

36:07.000 --> 36:08.700
till rehearsal this afternoon.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.400
Actually, that's
why I came by.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.700
I need you to listen
to something.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.300
What do you mean?

36:15.300 --> 36:17.400
You want to sing something
for me?

36:17.600 --> 36:18.700
Not exactly.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.400
Brooke?

36:25.200 --> 36:26.000
<i>Now, Mr. Kaye,</i>

36:26.000 --> 36:28.200
obviously, what we
need from you is

36:28.200 --> 36:30.000
someone to corroborate
your whereabouts

36:30.000 --> 36:33.600
for the 24 hours prior tk the
discovery of the Goldman boy.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.000
You have
another visitor.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.400
A mouse?

36:37.400 --> 36:39.100
It means something.
I'm sorry.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.300
Not to me. Neither does
the green denim jacket

36:41.300 --> 36:42.300
or the dancing.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.100
I don't know what to tell you,
Allison,

36:46.100 --> 36:47.400
but you can't hang around here.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.300
I'm just starting to get some
traction with the new D.A.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.600
If he finds out you were here... Fine.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.900
Maybe you could do me a favor.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.100
Maybe you could give me a call
when you're done with all this.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.300
Or maybe, uh...

36:57.700 --> 37:00.100
maybe you could pick up
the phone when I call you.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.500
I could probably swing that.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.800
I miss Devalos.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.300
Me, too.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.000
* Girls in white dresses

37:19.400 --> 37:23.000
* With blue satin sashes

37:23.400 --> 37:29.900
* Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes *

37:30.100 --> 37:33.100
* Silver white winters

37:33.300 --> 37:37.100
* That melt into springs... *

37:37.300 --> 37:38.400
I don't understand.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.400
When we get back home...

37:42.100 --> 37:43.600
what are we gonna do?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.900
What are you gonna do?

37:49.400 --> 37:50.300
I don't know.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.600
I'm not sure.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.100
I just can't spend
another day waiting

37:55.100 --> 37:56.900
for permission
to be who I am.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.800
I'm a lawyer.

37:58.800 --> 37:59.700
I practice law.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.200
It's all I really know.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.000
And if I can't do it
for the people,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.900
I'll open up my own office.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.100
I'll start my own practice.

38:08.400 --> 38:13.800
* These are a few
of my favorite things *

38:14.400 --> 38:18.000
* Raindrops on roses

38:18.400 --> 38:21.900
* And whiskers on kittens *

38:22.500 --> 38:29.200
* Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens *

38:29.900 --> 38:36.900
* Brown paper packages tied up
with strings... *

38:37.300 --> 38:38.700
Miss Heath...

38:39.400 --> 38:41.200
apparently you also
have a key.

38:45.400 --> 38:51.200
* These are a few
of my favorite things... *

38:51.800 --> 38:53.400
What the hell is that?
Who...

38:53.700 --> 38:55.400
Somebody unlocking
the warehouse door.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.500
* When the dog bites *

39:01.900 --> 39:05.200
* When the bee stings

39:05.900 --> 39:10.600
* When I'm feeling sad... *

39:10.800 --> 39:11.900
Well, I don't
understand.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.600
I thought everyone who had
keys to the building

39:13.600 --> 39:14.900
were here this morning.

39:15.700 --> 39:16.400
Well, yeah.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.800
Everyone
who works for us.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.300
Oh.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.700
Sorry.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.800
You, you guys having a meeting?

39:28.800 --> 39:29.900
Nobody told me.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.200
And you are?

39:31.300 --> 39:32.300
Oh, the exterminator.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.400
We have a contract.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.900
Put some poison out
the other day.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.800
I'm just back
to pick up the mice.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.200
The mice?

39:38.200 --> 39:39.000
Mice.

39:39.000 --> 39:39.800
Rats.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.500
They've had a real problem
with them.

39:41.500 --> 39:43.300
See, I put the poison out
a couple of nights ago.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.900
But thing is,
once they eat that stuff,

39:44.900 --> 39:46.800
it makes them really stiff
and bloody.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
So you really want
to get rid of them

39:48.000 --> 39:49.300
before it starts
to smell,

39:49.300 --> 39:50.800
and it gets
into the air-conditioning.

39:51.900 --> 39:53.200
Is it okay? I...

39:53.300 --> 39:54.600
I won't make too much noise.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.700
We should question him.
He has a key.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.500
Uh, you know what?

39:59.600 --> 40:01.600
I left my gloves
in my other jacket.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.400
I just gonna run
to my truck.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.400
Uh, you mind if I come with?

40:06.900 --> 40:07.600
Yeah.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.700
A little bit.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.400
Who the hell are you?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.900
I'm a detective
with the Phoenix Police force.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.200
I'm investigating the murder
of a young boy.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.100
I- I'd like to ask you

40:16.100 --> 40:17.300
some questions.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.200
* I simply remember... *

40:21.300 --> 40:22.800
What was the color
of that other jacket?

40:25.800 --> 40:27.000
Was it green?

40:27.200 --> 40:31.000
* My favorite things

40:31.500 --> 40:35.200
* And then I don't feel... *

40:46.100 --> 40:52.100
* So bad! *

40:55.500 --> 40:56.300
Hello.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.500
Green denim jacket.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.700
He was doing
a little dancy thing

41:00.700 --> 41:02.100
when he first walked
in the room.

41:02.100 --> 41:02.900
Exterminator.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.700
Which I guess explains
the mouse.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.400
So what are you doing?

41:08.300 --> 41:09.300
Me, I'm just, uh...

41:09.300 --> 41:10.300
I'm paying bills.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.600
Well, no, actually...

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Lee, someone's at the door.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.500
This guy Van Dyke-
he's an idiot.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.200
Let me try and talk to him
about you.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.800
Let me see
if we can't get you back here...

41:20.800 --> 41:22.300
at least part-time.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.800
Raally. So they making snowballs
in hell now?

41:27.600 --> 41:29.100
Lee, let me call you back.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.700
I Googled you.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.900
Apparently I owe
you an apology.

41:38.300 --> 41:39.300
$2,500?

41:39.300 --> 41:40.400
This is a personal check.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.700
This is your check.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.500
Why are you doing this?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.500
I couldn't get you
the reward.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.400
Um, you didn't find him-

41:47.400 --> 41:50.100
I mean, your clue didn't
really find him-

41:50.100 --> 41:51.900
but I thought

41:52.400 --> 41:53.800
maybe we could
keep in touch.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.200
Perhaps come to some sort
of an arrangement.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.900
Not between you
and Ameritips,

41:59.900 --> 42:01.600
but between you and me.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.800
I'm an investigator,

42:03.800 --> 42:05.900
and someone
like you...

42:08.200 --> 42:09.100
I have a feeling

42:09.100 --> 42:12.100
that we could do each other
a lot of good.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.600
And as I mentioned
the other night,

42:16.500 --> 42:18.900
I'm really quite intuitive, too.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.700
I'll be calling.
