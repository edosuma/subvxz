WEBVTT

00:01.799 --> 00:03.080
Like how I decorated?

00:03.370 --> 00:05.541
Good thing you're a cool dude,
or I'd have to kill you.

00:05.803 --> 00:09.420
- You let the damn team down.
- I'll do whatever it takes to stay.

00:09.682 --> 00:13.007
- Santiago has been working for me.
- This is a boy who needs a home.

00:13.269 --> 00:15.676
- He should move in with me.
- First real bed I ever had.

00:15.956 --> 00:17.625
I like you. A lot.

00:20.568 --> 00:23.350
You have not grown up yet.
And you are not rid me yet, you hear?

00:23.612 --> 00:24.701
Go to hell!

00:25.333 --> 00:26.520
I got this secret.

00:26.782 --> 00:29.356
And it's startin'
to literally eat away at me.

00:29.618 --> 00:30.691
Just tell the truth.

00:30.953 --> 00:34.695
I need to speak to someone about the
murder of Mike Caldwell. I killed him.

00:40.459 --> 00:43.413
And I went inside to get the food,
and she stayed outside.

00:43.573 --> 00:46.853
As soon as I heard what was happening,
I dropped the bag and I ran out

00:47.210 --> 00:48.894
and I just started hitting him.

00:49.075 --> 00:51.241
You stepped in to help your friend,
is that it?

00:51.401 --> 00:52.629
I wanted to kill him.

00:52.789 --> 00:55.151
Yeah, but he was actually
hurting the girl, right?

00:58.389 --> 01:00.584
I picked up a pipe
from the ground and I ran over.

01:00.744 --> 01:03.186
I hit him twice in the head
as hard as I could.

01:03.944 --> 01:07.097
Now listen. I'm gonna go get
a tape recorder, all right?

01:07.257 --> 01:08.566
And I'm gonna be right back.

01:09.265 --> 01:10.454
Stay put.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.570
Chad.

01:18.231 --> 01:20.749
The boy is not helping himself
out in there.

- Dad, what exactly are you doing?
- We're goin' home

01:32.764 --> 01:34.755
We really weren't done talking in there.

01:35.017 --> 01:37.984
We just need to go
and figure some things out, son.

01:38.354 --> 01:40.805
There's not anything to figure out.
I'm here to confess,

01:40.965 --> 01:44.218
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
We didn't finish what we're doing.

01:44.378 --> 01:46.968
- If we please go back in here.
- Son, listen to me.

01:47.128 --> 01:49.061
Detective Tamber's trying to help you
out here.

01:49.323 --> 01:52.523
I don't need to be helped out.
I need you to come back in here

01:52.803 --> 01:55.192
so I can finish telling you
what... what it is...

01:55.454 --> 01:59.154
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
I'm not... I came here to confess

01:59.416 --> 02:02.518
- and that's exactly...
- You're goin' home. You're goin' home.

02:02.678 --> 02:03.868
Now! Let's go!

02:04.028 --> 02:05.744
- I'm not done telling you...
- Let's go!

02:11.568 --> 02:13.432
I love you, bud. Let's go home.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.359
Matthew.

03:12.448 --> 03:13.979
Did you eat my Snackwells?

03:16.368 --> 03:17.849
My Snackwells!

03:18.043 --> 03:21.263
Grandma, it's probably late
for you to be eating snacks.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.656
Well, I want you to ask Carlotta
if she ate the Snackwells.

03:27.131 --> 03:31.246
- You want me to ask her now?
- Well, no. In the morning!

03:33.088 --> 03:34.750
Gettin' kinda tired of this.

03:37.527 --> 03:39.486
You stole my grandma's Snackwells.

03:39.646 --> 03:41.882
You probably ate 'em too.
First you take the tapioca...

03:43.448 --> 03:45.341
- Did I wake you up?
- Hi, Gracie.

03:45.606 --> 03:47.095
Sweetheart, will you please

03:47.357 --> 03:48.887
make sure that you call today?

03:49.177 --> 03:53.515
Call the party rental place today
and make sure that they are not late.

03:54.490 --> 03:58.524
- Before coming, you've got to shave.
- It's the 3rd time you've asked.

03:58.786 --> 04:00.484
Mom, are these organic apples?

04:01.214 --> 04:03.417
I doubt it seriously,
they were on sale.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.863
I asked for organic apples.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.486
Are you going to go shopping
for the christening dress?

04:07.646 --> 04:08.992
And you've got the flowers?

04:09.254 --> 04:12.788
- You're gonna clean up your room,
- Do you trust me to clean up my room?

04:13.050 --> 04:14.901
I'm not gonna honor that
with a response.

04:15.061 --> 04:16.735
You just need to chill out.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.956
This christening thing
is not that big of a deal.

04:19.116 --> 04:21.409
It is a big deal because first,
you're the godmother.

04:21.569 --> 04:23.731
Second, we've got family
comin' in from out of town.

04:24.183 --> 04:26.766
It's your sister, and it's our family,
and it's a big deal.

04:27.526 --> 04:29.539
I'm not only the coach around here,

04:29.733 --> 04:32.266
but I'm also the director
of the athletic program.

04:32.775 --> 04:34.685
And I've been brainstorming

04:34.947 --> 04:37.604
'cause the other departments
are woefully understaffed.

04:38.265 --> 04:40.274
And I have been looking for someone who

04:40.993 --> 04:43.603
owes me a favor. Someone who

04:44.095 --> 04:46.154
has been disrespectful

04:46.419 --> 04:49.616
and has shown
a great deal of selfishness.

04:50.252 --> 04:52.834
Can you think of anyone
off the top of your head?

04:53.935 --> 04:56.623
Top of my head, first guy
that comes to mind is probably Williams.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.751
You know what? I got a lot on my plate
right now, Riggins.

05:04.005 --> 05:06.070
But I thank you very much
for volonteering.

05:06.241 --> 05:09.297
And where we can start is with
the girls' varsity soccer ball uniforms.

05:09.457 --> 05:12.139
- And they are mighty dirty.
- So I'm just doing laundry now?

05:13.516 --> 05:14.831
It ain't gonna do itself.

05:15.904 --> 05:17.311
You know what? Don't even try

05:17.573 --> 05:20.480
and show me that screech porn again
'cause little piece of me dies...

05:20.742 --> 05:24.693
Hey, listen, man. I got somethin' else
for ya. It's a dating web site.

05:24.955 --> 05:27.029
- No way.
- Hey, prudy, come on, man.

05:27.291 --> 05:30.134
It's wheellovers.com, man.
It's bona fide. I'm tellin' you right-

05:30.294 --> 05:32.492
I'm sure there are lookers.
They gotta be heifers.

05:32.754 --> 05:35.579
Take a gander.
Take a gander.

05:35.952 --> 05:36.956
Come on, man.

05:37.116 --> 05:39.958
- Isabella. Stop on Isabella.
- Forget her. I'm looking for Charmaine.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.877
Normal looking, which is a shocker.

05:42.139 --> 05:43.629
Charmaine got a link to her

05:43.891 --> 05:45.255
myspace page.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.636
- Wait, don't go there yet.
- Blow!

05:47.824 --> 05:52.095
She got the camouflage panties. You
can't see 'em cause they're camouflaged.

05:52.357 --> 05:54.775
- Is that your sister?
- Don't make it weird, man.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.850
Now I ain't able to look at it.

05:58.197 --> 06:00.270
I just thought
I'd bring you boys a snack.

06:00.532 --> 06:03.654
What was I just saying about
carrot sticks? I love carrot sticks.

06:03.814 --> 06:06.326
- He loves carrot sticks.
- Thank you so much.

06:06.523 --> 06:07.694
Hand 'em over.

06:07.956 --> 06:09.817
Just let me know
if you need anything else.

06:09.977 --> 06:10.989
Will do.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.533
- Carrots and cookies.
- Beta-carotene: good for ya.

06:13.795 --> 06:14.952
Party time.

06:15.214 --> 06:17.306
You gotta get out of this place, man.

06:18.777 --> 06:21.917
He runs 4', 4'40, benches 330 pounds.

06:22.261 --> 06:25.587
When he comes to the quarterback,
it looks like he's standing still.

06:26.074 --> 06:28.673
- It sounds like the second coming.
- Hallelujah.

06:29.274 --> 06:30.926
How about it, kid? You walk on water?

06:31.485 --> 06:33.482
You rain down fumbles from above?

06:34.999 --> 06:37.766
And you may play a lot friday night too,
Santiago.

06:38.351 --> 06:39.485
Be prepared.

06:50.709 --> 06:52.644
Landry went down to the police station

06:53.166 --> 06:55.242
and confessed the murder last night.

06:59.730 --> 07:03.501
We're meeting with a lawyer,
and you'll need one too.

07:04.987 --> 07:06.065
This guy's a...

07:07.228 --> 07:08.839
good criminal defense attorney.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.701
Just have your mom call me
when she gets home

07:11.861 --> 07:14.959
- if you'll need help with the fees.
- What's gonna happen to Landry?

07:15.515 --> 07:16.515
I don't know.

07:24.118 --> 07:26.044
Looking good! Riggins!

07:30.047 --> 07:32.779
- Back on the football team, huh?
- Looks like it. Yeah.

07:35.412 --> 07:37.545
So long as when you realize
return to the herd

07:37.705 --> 07:39.368
is the biggest mistake of your life.

07:40.359 --> 07:42.201
Don't tell me I didn't tell you so.

07:48.379 --> 07:49.379
Okay.

07:50.125 --> 07:51.125
I won't.

08:05.450 --> 08:06.450
You idiot.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.706
Your dad told me what you did. Why?

08:14.546 --> 08:16.394
'Cause it was the right thing to do.

08:18.473 --> 08:20.322
I don't understand it, but I...

08:21.420 --> 08:23.477
I just can't keep lying.

08:24.032 --> 08:26.847
I wish I could but... I can't.

08:31.933 --> 08:34.221
Come on, let's go, D!
Let's go, D!

08:38.815 --> 08:40.303
Come on, Santiago.

08:40.567 --> 08:41.765
Take that block on.

08:42.904 --> 08:45.046
Did we not have this goin' last week?

08:45.218 --> 08:48.730
We were doin' fine last week.
What's different last week and now?

08:52.272 --> 08:55.356
You contain 'em on the outside,
don't you? You key off the back

08:55.516 --> 08:57.739
to see if he rushed the passer.
If he holds that ball:

08:58.001 --> 09:00.907
jailbreak. You go after the quarterback,
you understand that?

09:02.287 --> 09:03.737
Do you understand that?

09:03.938 --> 09:06.621
- Can I have a verbal response, please?
- Yes, Coach.

09:06.994 --> 09:09.605
Good. Thank you.
Now let's see you do it.

09:13.934 --> 09:16.460
- What's wrong with my boy?
- You know, he's got great instincts

09:16.620 --> 09:18.385
until you put him in first D.

09:18.647 --> 09:20.612
He's having a bad day.
We all have a bad day.

09:20.772 --> 09:23.385
An outside linebacker can get it done,
and I don't think he's it.

09:23.545 --> 09:26.523
To tell you the truth, I think
it's his head, and that scares me.

09:32.164 --> 09:35.777
Things can go in
vastly different directions on this.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.049
What do you mean?

09:37.213 --> 09:39.461
He could be trialed as an adult
for murder,

09:39.621 --> 09:42.784
or he can be let out on probation.
It all depends on how we frame it.

09:43.324 --> 09:45.120
What exactly does that mean,
to frame it?

09:47.885 --> 09:50.625
Well, the legal definition is
defense of another.

09:51.150 --> 09:54.811
If you reasonably believe
that it was necessary to hit that man

09:55.417 --> 10:00.195
with the pipe to protect your friend
from serious injury or death,

10:01.110 --> 10:03.388
- then there's no crime.
- Well, I killed him, sir.

10:05.418 --> 10:07.317
Necessary to protect

10:08.091 --> 10:10.684
someone from serious injury

10:10.983 --> 10:14.650
or death. Those are the magic words
that we need to focus on.

10:14.911 --> 10:17.104
Why do I need magic words

10:17.940 --> 10:19.946
to try and make me look good for this?

10:20.327 --> 10:23.742
- Do you not understand what I'm saying?
- Landry, I understand very well.

10:24.004 --> 10:25.882
I don't need to frame this
to make me look good

10:26.042 --> 10:27.905
when the matter is that
I killed this man.

10:28.084 --> 10:30.165
I understand that.
I've got the record right here.

10:30.623 --> 10:34.336
But when I use the word frame,
don't think of it in a negative sense.

10:35.162 --> 10:38.924
They can't catch him. He's too fast.
He scores!

10:40.270 --> 10:41.394
Hey, stranger.

10:43.023 --> 10:45.430
- What brings you by here?
- Just drivin' by.

10:45.692 --> 10:48.058
It's my favorite Christian
in the neiborhood. One second.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.596
Yeah, go ahead.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.450
Hello.

10:53.802 --> 10:54.802
Yeah, speaking.

10:57.121 --> 10:58.485
Oh, hey, hi, Isabella. Yeah.

10:59.035 --> 11:02.423
No, it's great to... It's great
to actually hear your voice, yeah.

11:02.874 --> 11:05.116
No, this weekend is...
Yeah, that's fine.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.006
Okay. That sounds good to me.

11:09.674 --> 11:11.813
All right, talk to you later. Bye.

11:12.444 --> 11:14.532
- Shut up.
- So who's Isabella?

11:14.692 --> 11:17.213
She's just a friend of Herc's.

11:17.448 --> 11:19.464
It's kinda like a setup thing.

11:20.325 --> 11:23.885
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah, it is, actually.

11:24.147 --> 11:26.846
- Are you smitten?
- No. I'm not smitten.

11:27.216 --> 11:28.781
We haven't even met yet.

11:28.977 --> 11:31.425
We're gonna go out this weekend
for the first time, you know.

11:31.585 --> 11:32.894
I might've seen a picture.

11:34.184 --> 11:35.188
That's very cool.

11:39.839 --> 11:40.839
Hey.

11:41.094 --> 11:43.819
Hey. What are you doing in here?
You said we weren't supposed to see

11:43.979 --> 11:45.240
each other at school.

11:45.502 --> 11:48.092
This is an exception.
I need to talk to you.

11:48.252 --> 11:51.495
That sounds great. Sit down then.
What can I do for you?

11:51.655 --> 11:54.573
Okay, so it's about mom
and the whole baby christening thing.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.876
- She's going off the rails.
- What do you mean?

11:57.325 --> 11:59.067
You've seen her yelling about cupcakes,

11:59.227 --> 12:01.392
and party decorations
and foldig chairs...

12:01.552 --> 12:02.971
It's very important to her.

12:03.131 --> 12:05.476
And I realize it's an important day,
and for Grace.

12:05.636 --> 12:06.978
But I just... I don't know.

12:07.138 --> 12:09.264
I feel like I'm going to
disappoint her or something.

12:12.138 --> 12:13.857
What do you mean "disappoint her"?

12:14.017 --> 12:16.019
I feel like... I don't know.

12:16.188 --> 12:19.493
I mean, I want to help. I really do.
But I just feel like she's asking me

12:19.653 --> 12:23.003
to do a million things at once.
I have to keep up with my schoolwork.

12:23.163 --> 12:24.779
And I'm practising for my SAT's,

12:25.041 --> 12:27.445
and I have dance class,
and I write for the school paper.

12:27.605 --> 12:30.410
All right, you know what I'll do?
I'll talk to her.

12:32.421 --> 12:34.205
- Really?
- That surprise you?

12:38.122 --> 12:39.732
Thanks. I appreciate it.

12:41.266 --> 12:42.380
You're welcome.

13:12.584 --> 13:16.271
- You doing all right?
- Not really. We just hit a 8.6, Coach.

13:16.748 --> 13:18.541
Stacey should be hitting
those double backs.

13:18.803 --> 13:20.502
She's been her own worst enemy all day.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.087
It's pretty bad.

13:22.606 --> 13:23.754
<i>Go, Dillon!</i>

13:26.363 --> 13:27.467
Go, Panthers!

13:27.734 --> 13:29.686
Let's go, Panthers, let's go!

13:30.672 --> 13:31.886
Who is this guy?

13:32.531 --> 13:34.057
That's my roommate.

13:35.186 --> 13:38.478
Get him over to the bleachers.
Step over to the bleachers.

13:40.830 --> 13:41.986
It's a nice gig, man.

13:42.146 --> 13:44.776
- No. It's not a nice gig.
- You seen this blonde in that outfit?

13:45.038 --> 13:46.611
You know? You gotta let me, man.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.916
All right, let's get out of here then.
Go down to the landin' strip.

13:51.076 --> 13:52.921
Early bird special.
Check out Mindy's new...

13:53.254 --> 13:56.433
I can't go to the landing strip.
I gotta stay here till it's done.

13:56.593 --> 13:58.205
Cool. I can stay, man.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.563
I love me some acrobats.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.349
Look at these girls, man.
You kiddin' me?

14:03.801 --> 14:04.879
Let's go, Dillon!

14:07.841 --> 14:08.641
So...

14:09.540 --> 14:11.010
It's third and short.

14:11.404 --> 14:13.161
It's an obvious run situation.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.116
What defense you gonna be in?
Dime or prevent?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.807
- Dime?
- No. Neither.

14:19.986 --> 14:21.312
Trick question. I got you.

14:23.187 --> 14:25.483
Hey, how much of this book
do I need to know by tomorrow?

14:25.745 --> 14:26.985
All of it.

14:28.489 --> 14:29.489
Comin' up,

14:30.793 --> 14:32.468
somethin' I invented here.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.434
Steak and ramencini.

14:42.761 --> 14:45.234
Julie came into the office today
to talk to me.

14:45.475 --> 14:46.546
She did?

14:47.144 --> 14:48.322
What about?

14:50.622 --> 14:53.220
I think she's trying to help you out,
but she thinks

14:53.384 --> 14:57.215
that you don't understand that,
because she's got so much going on.

14:58.029 --> 15:01.140
She feels overextended
for all the things you're giving her.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.521
She's got her homework.
She's got school. She's got...

15:03.783 --> 15:06.776
- What things? What?
- Just the things that she... I mean...

15:06.936 --> 15:08.915
You're giving her a lot to do, I think.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.206
And she doesn't know how to deal
with everything. And she feels that...

15:12.366 --> 15:13.531
Wait a minute.

15:13.793 --> 15:16.791
She went into your office to talk to you

15:16.951 --> 15:19.162
about how I'm giving her too much to do?

15:20.712 --> 15:24.334
I mean, you realize that I don't think
that's what that's really about?

15:24.855 --> 15:27.899
'Cause I'll tell you right now.
If our laughter Julie who goes to school

15:28.059 --> 15:30.206
and comes home, is overextended,

15:30.447 --> 15:32.358
that's not the girl
we want to be raising,

15:32.518 --> 15:35.720
if she can't help out when we've got
a big family weekend coming up.

15:38.515 --> 15:40.709
I hope you were clear with her
about that.

15:41.514 --> 15:43.735
I told her just about
everything you said.

15:44.833 --> 15:45.855
I'm sure you did.

15:53.597 --> 15:54.572
Son,

15:54.834 --> 15:56.346
can you turn off the music?

15:58.092 --> 15:59.433
I just wanna talk.

16:02.735 --> 16:05.262
Look, I realize that you're mad.

16:06.991 --> 16:09.926
- I realize that that you don't think
- I'm not mad at you.

16:10.086 --> 16:12.966
- I can handle the consequences.
- No, I can't handle it.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.298
If you go to prison,

16:19.611 --> 16:21.161
it'll break my heart.

16:22.196 --> 16:25.253
- It'll completely destroy your mother.
- I'm not gonna lie about this, dad.

16:25.413 --> 16:27.063
Why is it a lie?

16:29.002 --> 16:32.148
You didn't even know the man was there
until you heard Tyra screaming.

16:32.308 --> 16:34.445
And when you came out,
he was attacking her.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.214
What about the fact
that he was walking away?

16:38.168 --> 16:39.909
Where does that come in to play?

16:40.520 --> 16:42.829
Didn't you try to save him?
That's what you told me.

16:43.788 --> 16:47.094
Son, this man raped
five other young women.

16:47.254 --> 16:49.715
You and Tyra were fearful
for your own lives.

16:53.241 --> 16:54.591
This was self-defense.

17:07.813 --> 17:09.107
Mornin', Coach

17:11.411 --> 17:14.652
Thought I'd get a head start on laundry
and whatever else you need me to do.

17:16.534 --> 17:18.946
This sudden work ethic of yours

17:19.107 --> 17:21.992
doesn't have anything to do
with your living situation, does it?

17:27.944 --> 17:28.944
Okay.

17:40.690 --> 17:41.888
How you doin'?

17:42.267 --> 17:44.307
Smash, you gotta stop
giving away the store, man.

17:44.569 --> 17:46.100
They don't count the ice cream.

17:47.363 --> 17:50.077
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Have a good one.

17:53.670 --> 17:54.776
Hey, how you doin'?

17:55.121 --> 17:58.196
- Oh, Smash, I got this.
- No, no. I got this.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.239
My name's Brian Williams,

18:00.501 --> 18:03.116
- but my good friends call me Smash.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

18:03.276 --> 18:04.911
But actually, I wanted to talk to Matt.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.952
You think you can make me
a rocket launcher with jimmies, please?

18:16.245 --> 18:17.799
He's gonna make some ice cream.

18:18.061 --> 18:19.505
What are you doin' here?

18:20.150 --> 18:22.899
- Grandma was in a burger mood.
- No, you're a liar.

18:23.059 --> 18:25.854
- No, she did.
- No, she didn't. You wanted to see me.

18:26.527 --> 18:27.809
Oh, thank you, sir.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.471
- I can't eat this.
- Yeah, you can. It's all for you.

18:32.865 --> 18:35.527
- I'm gonna go work on grandma's burger.
- Okay.

18:37.038 --> 18:37.860
My God.

18:38.122 --> 18:41.003
That's the girl livin' at your house?
It's your graduation day, fool.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.699
- Shut up.
- Smash taught you well.

18:42.961 --> 18:45.929
- Smash didn't teach me nothin'.
- The only sad thing is:

18:46.089 --> 18:49.049
you're right in the middle
of something too good to last.

18:49.209 --> 18:52.341
- What are you talking about?
- 'Cause this a situation with no rules.

18:52.501 --> 18:56.005
Women like boundaries, okay?
They always want to define things.

18:56.207 --> 18:58.547
No, but she's different,
she ain't like that.

18:58.707 --> 19:01.718
Listen. You want this thing to last?
You need to set some ground rules.

19:10.819 --> 19:13.641
Tyra, I feel like I'm choosing
between jail or hell.

19:18.559 --> 19:21.446
Will you please just tell me the truth?

19:24.571 --> 19:26.470
Were you in fear for your life?

19:27.617 --> 19:30.235
Were you honestly in fear
for your life, Tyra?

19:37.544 --> 19:40.396
He would've raped me.
He could...

19:42.546 --> 19:43.928
He coulda killed me...

19:53.489 --> 19:55.200
if you hadn't been there...

19:59.894 --> 20:01.018
You saved me.

20:11.469 --> 20:13.118
So you're ready for the game tonight?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.575
You may see
some playin' time tonight, son.

20:17.773 --> 20:21.346
- What the hell's the point of all this?
- What'd you say, Santiago?

20:22.338 --> 20:24.314
- I can't do it.
- What?

20:26.864 --> 20:28.809
What do you care if I play, huh?

20:30.734 --> 20:32.159
You don't know me.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.857
You're not my pops!
You don't know nothin' about me.

20:37.017 --> 20:40.917
You're just some fat white guy
who wants to make himself feel good.

20:41.077 --> 20:43.110
And I don't need
nothin' from you, all right?

20:43.372 --> 20:46.239
I don't need your car dealership
and I sure as hell don't need football!

20:51.414 --> 20:54.117
Shut that door.
Shut the door!

21:00.751 --> 21:02.112
I'll tell you what,

21:02.713 --> 21:07.684
you want to go back to that cafeteria
eatin' off of plastic

21:07.980 --> 21:11.472
with 200 guys goin' nowhere,
you be my guest, son.

21:15.682 --> 21:16.939
Now listen to me.

21:17.435 --> 21:20.046
Tonight is your night.

21:20.741 --> 21:26.095
You have an opportunity to go out there
and accept the challenge.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.782
You have the opportunity
to become part of a team.

21:31.819 --> 21:33.710
If you don't do it tonight,

21:34.860 --> 21:37.584
then you're never gonna do it
in your entire life.

21:38.971 --> 21:42.857
Now, I'm goin' to the field.
So you get out, be my guest.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.030
I hate you.

21:51.257 --> 21:52.534
I hate you all.

22:00.590 --> 22:02.833
I'm so glad that y'all
are gonna make it.

22:03.619 --> 22:06.623
I know. Good, good, good.
We'll see you. Bye-bye.

22:07.505 --> 22:09.092
Okay. So this is the godmother dress.

22:13.754 --> 22:15.912
Obviously this is
another thing I did wrong.

22:16.174 --> 22:19.061
Well, sweetie, I'm just... I like it.
I think maybe, you know, if...

22:19.343 --> 22:23.306
So tell me what you want me to wear,
I will put it on. Tell me what to wear.

22:23.466 --> 22:24.849
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

22:25.009 --> 22:26.096
What you're doing.

22:26.392 --> 22:28.484
- What am I doing?
- Let's get something straight.

22:28.644 --> 22:32.238
It's been difficult
since Gracie came into this family.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.986
But it's time for you
to rise up and to grow up.

22:36.186 --> 22:40.542
It's not about Gracie.
This has nothing to do with Gracie.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.040
I would love to grow up.
Why don't you let me?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.355
I'm not doing anything to keep
you from growing up.

22:45.515 --> 22:47.360
OK, so according to you,

22:47.622 --> 22:49.677
I can't dress myself,
I can't pick my own friends,

22:49.867 --> 22:52.823
I can't make my own plans.
I can't even go to the mall

22:53.085 --> 22:55.544
and pick out a dress with Shelly.
Everything I do is wrong.

22:55.704 --> 22:56.979
You know that's not true.

22:57.139 --> 22:59.178
So somebody can take
a picture at this christening

22:59.342 --> 23:01.821
with your perfect little family
and your perfect little baby?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.746
I'm not trying to make
everybody different.

23:03.906 --> 23:06.180
I am trying to get you to grow up
into the person that I know

23:06.340 --> 23:09.048
that I raised into this family,
and the beautiful girl that you are.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.217
I'm acting a lot more grownup
than you are.

23:11.479 --> 23:14.144
- Don't scream.
- I think you're the one who started.

23:14.304 --> 23:16.358
You have been absent
ever since that baby was born.

23:16.518 --> 23:17.606
Don't tell me...

23:17.766 --> 23:19.897
Don't you scream in front of the baby.

23:20.057 --> 23:22.397
Don't you dare tell me
I'm not helping out.

23:22.573 --> 23:26.169
Do you know how many things
I've done for you?

23:26.659 --> 23:28.632
Do you know how many things
I've done for you?

23:28.792 --> 23:31.652
A thank you would be nice.
That's all I'm asking for.

23:41.826 --> 23:44.143
Well, I think a thank you
would be nice too.

23:54.772 --> 23:58.462
So why did you attack Mike Caldwell
on august 15, 2007?

24:00.515 --> 24:02.668
I thought he was going
to kill my friend.

24:03.596 --> 24:04.794
He was attacking her,

24:04.954 --> 24:07.248
and it didn't look like
he was gonna stop.

24:14.358 --> 24:15.850
I was in fear for my life.

24:20.521 --> 24:22.882
So I tried to be a vegan when I was 14.

24:23.268 --> 24:26.705
- How long did that last?
- Like six hours.

24:27.027 --> 24:29.680
- That's longer than I'd be able to do.
- It was awful.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.121
I'm from Texas so...

24:32.446 --> 24:35.176
Would it be awkward if I was to ask you

24:35.336 --> 24:37.421
why exactly you posted on the web site?

24:38.301 --> 24:41.402
Well, is it awkward
if I ask you why you were browsing it?

24:43.248 --> 24:44.719
Yeah, kind of.

24:45.536 --> 24:46.513
Kinda.

24:46.673 --> 24:49.066
- You all done with these?
- Yeah. Thank you.

24:50.219 --> 24:52.973
I see your point.
I'll refrain from asking that question.

24:53.133 --> 24:54.377
It's no big deal.

24:54.537 --> 24:56.864
I guess I just want to find guys
who are more open-minded.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.888
That is stupid.

24:59.048 --> 25:01.940
Good answer. No. No.
Completely understand.

25:07.442 --> 25:08.793
Can I be honest with you?

25:11.621 --> 25:14.445
- Of course.
- Can I tell you what gets me going?

25:16.578 --> 25:17.578
Sure.

25:20.386 --> 25:21.388
Pee.

25:26.055 --> 25:27.659
Excuse me for a minute?

25:41.357 --> 25:43.192
Excuse me.
Could you do me a favor?

25:43.352 --> 25:45.305
Could you tell the lady that I had...

25:45.465 --> 25:47.454
There's an urgent family matter
I had to attend?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.958
If the date's not going well,
just say something.

25:50.118 --> 25:52.710
- I'm not gonna help you ditch her.
- I'm not trying to ditch her.

25:52.870 --> 25:54.213
You completely misunderstand.

25:54.475 --> 25:58.130
She's not your type, fine. Be honest
with her so you can both move forward.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.828
I met this girl on a web site
and now she's talkin' about pee

26:00.988 --> 26:03.229
and I'm not exactly comfortable
with where it's goin'.

26:03.389 --> 26:04.330
What?

26:16.299 --> 26:18.970
- Care for dessert?
- I'll wait for my friend to get back.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.870
Your friend left.

26:22.573 --> 26:24.923
- Excuse me?
- Yeah. He left.

26:25.666 --> 26:29.165
I'm sorry, you must be mistaken,
'cause he's in a wheelchair and I drove.

26:29.778 --> 26:31.115
I'm sorry, he did.

26:31.846 --> 26:35.477
So he just left the restaurant
and started wheelin' down the road?

26:35.637 --> 26:37.840
- Honey, I don't have any idea.
- Whoa, don't honey me.

26:38.367 --> 26:39.592
Don't ever...

26:39.854 --> 26:42.344
- Calm down. Ma'am, calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

26:53.534 --> 26:55.632
Hey Rig, you getting crunked over there?

26:58.223 --> 26:59.360
Let's go!

27:16.165 --> 27:19.215
<i>I tell you what,
this four hood quarterback, JD Pepper</i>

27:19.477 --> 27:22.131
<i>has lived up to his billing
as Mr Untouchable.</i>

27:22.291 --> 27:25.054
<i>The Panther defense has yet
to get a saddle on Pepper</i>

27:25.316 --> 27:28.224
<i>as he's s thrown strikes
from the pocket all night long,</i>

27:28.486 --> 27:31.963

on three of four possessions.</i>

27:35.197 --> 27:36.670
<i>Pepper lets one go.</i>

27:37.495 --> 27:39.693
<i>And touchdown for Hood!</i>

27:39.955 --> 27:41.845
<i>As the cougars pull further ahead,</i>

27:42.005 --> 27:46.025
<i>28 to 13, that ends the second quarter.</i>

27:46.189 --> 27:49.589
<i>Coach Taylor has got to shake up
his defense for the second half,</i>

27:49.749 --> 27:52.373
<i>and find somebody who's gonna
put pressure on their quarterback</i>

27:52.642 --> 27:55.751
<i>or that Pepper train's gonna
keep on rolling.</i>

27:56.391 --> 27:57.461
Coach.

27:57.723 --> 27:59.373
Mac said you wanted to talk to me.

27:59.533 --> 28:02.091
Here's what I got to tell ya.
I'd like for you to play Santiago.

28:02.353 --> 28:04.218
He's not ready to get in the game.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.866
He is a street fighter. You never know
until you put him in the ring.

28:08.598 --> 28:10.048
Give the kid a chance.

28:10.903 --> 28:11.903
I'm askin'.

28:13.463 --> 28:14.656
Is that it?

28:15.115 --> 28:17.180
I'll take it into consideration.

28:19.243 --> 28:22.319
<i>Anyone who's expecting a second
half adjustment from coach Taylor</i>

28:22.581 --> 28:26.198
<i>is sorely disappointed.
as the JD Pepper hilight reel</i>

28:26.460 --> 28:30.786
<i>continues at the expense
of this gizmo Dillon defense.</i>

28:37.236 --> 28:38.492
Santiago!

28:41.384 --> 28:43.382
Come here. Come here.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.457
Get your helmet on. You're goin' in.

28:47.702 --> 28:49.386
Get your ass in there. Let's go.

28:49.983 --> 28:51.257
Come on!

28:51.978 --> 28:53.183
Come on, 59!

29:05.133 --> 29:07.197
Let's go, girls.
Time to step it up, right now!

29:07.459 --> 29:09.908
4-3, wide eyes,
outside diamond. Ready?

29:28.397 --> 29:29.654
- You ready?
- Ready!

29:41.076 --> 29:43.919
Don't come this way, bitch,
or I'll knock your ass out again.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.259
You gotta hit him! You gotta hit him!

30:13.643 --> 30:16.225
Wake up! It's time for you to wake up!
You hear me?

30:16.487 --> 30:17.976
Cover 4. Cover 4. Ready?

30:41.261 --> 30:44.461
Get it! Get the ball!
Get the ball! Get the ball!

30:45.808 --> 30:47.561
All right. Here we go.

31:03.951 --> 31:06.733
All right. Here we go! Here we go!

31:08.330 --> 31:10.028
You' going back in!

31:23.467 --> 31:26.087
Good game, Smash. Good game, guys.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.381
Santiago.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.470
You won that game, son.

31:34.732 --> 31:36.439
- No. I just...
- Listen to me.

31:36.603 --> 31:40.121
Listen to me. You changed
the momentum of the game.

31:40.904 --> 31:42.478
You brought the magic.

31:45.409 --> 31:46.894
And, uh...

31:47.863 --> 31:52.070
About earlier in the car, that was cold.

31:52.332 --> 31:53.914
No, no. Thank you.

31:55.358 --> 31:56.366
For what?

32:00.840 --> 32:01.914
Thank you.

32:05.804 --> 32:08.086
- So I opened the door.
- Right.

32:08.348 --> 32:10.329
And he is completely covered in leather.

32:10.489 --> 32:12.095
I mean, head to toe.

32:12.382 --> 32:16.352
Oh, yeah. He had the shoes.
He had the pants, the vest, the jacket,

32:16.546 --> 32:17.554
little biker hat.

32:17.816 --> 32:20.857
- He's a winner.
- That's a winner.

32:21.343 --> 32:24.937
But I have to ask you:
Did he have to go number one?

32:25.199 --> 32:28.364
Yoou are pretty competitive
in the whole bad date arena, aren't you?

32:28.524 --> 32:30.172
I'm always competitive about everything.

32:30.351 --> 32:32.528
And as far as this arena goes,
it's no contest, I win.

32:34.028 --> 32:35.918
Okay. Fine. Okay, you win.

32:36.078 --> 32:38.594
I'll give it to you this time.
All right.

32:41.003 --> 32:42.454
You really saved my ass tonight.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.748
No problem.

33:04.501 --> 33:05.727
Do you think we should...

33:08.890 --> 33:10.378
talk about maybe some

33:10.885 --> 33:12.025
ground rules?

33:13.944 --> 33:16.043
- What?
- You know, just...

33:16.491 --> 33:19.283
Kinda just put the fish on the table
so that we both

33:19.561 --> 33:21.419
so that we both know what's goin' on,

33:21.579 --> 33:23.679
how we each feel,
that way no one'll get hurt.

33:23.839 --> 33:25.163
Smash kinda had

33:25.425 --> 33:28.414
this point about how if we don't both...

33:38.269 --> 33:40.137
I think I wanna teach you
how to make mole.

33:41.942 --> 33:43.312
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:44.624 --> 33:45.895
Good night, Matt.

34:00.007 --> 34:02.661
- Tim.
- Oh, God!

34:02.963 --> 34:04.494
You forgot to feed the ferrets.

34:05.363 --> 34:06.616
Put it down.

34:07.118 --> 34:08.790
You forgot to feed the ferrets.

34:09.052 --> 34:11.888
What'd I say you had to do to stay here?
I told you to feed the ferrets.

34:14.634 --> 34:15.634
I'm sorry.

34:20.532 --> 34:22.763
- Put it down.
- Got you.

34:23.346 --> 34:26.145
You should've seen your face, man.
Come on, man.

34:26.304 --> 34:29.658
Some of my friends stopped by.
We're having a little impromptu soiree.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.232
Why don't you meet my buddies?

34:31.467 --> 34:33.623
Come on, man,
'cause you didn't feed the ferrets?

34:34.964 --> 34:36.907
Hey, but feed the ferrets, dude.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.982
Hey, buddy,
did you feed the ferrets today?

34:42.382 --> 34:44.284
Tim, man, these are my buddies.

34:44.545 --> 34:46.574
Shotgun, Connor,

34:47.290 --> 34:49.184
Spence and Pete is
around here somewhere.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.791
- How you doin' today?
- That's Pete right there.

34:52.721 --> 34:53.721
This is Lisa.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.233
Here you go.

34:56.001 --> 34:59.466
I'm alright. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go get some vodka.

34:59.954 --> 35:02.639
- Oh, that's good idea.
- You guys need anything?

35:02.799 --> 35:04.262
You need some money, man?

35:04.650 --> 35:05.813
No, I'm good.

35:07.937 --> 35:10.936
What'd I tell ya?
My roommate's a giver, not a taker.

35:52.181 --> 35:54.228
- Hey, dad.
- You all right?

35:54.388 --> 35:57.519
- Yes, sir.
- Jason Mitchell Street.

35:57.953 --> 36:00.504
Your father has been up all night
trying to call you.

36:00.664 --> 36:03.065
- We had no idea where you were.
- Yeah, she's right.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.031
- This is not fair to your mother.
- You guys are right.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.924
To neither of us. You understand that?

36:08.084 --> 36:10.245
It's unfair for you to stay up
and wonder where I am.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.901
I'm sorry. It can't happen again
and it won't happen again, okay?

36:17.686 --> 36:19.225
I'm movin' in with Herc.

36:23.353 --> 36:25.093
- You just gonna wear this?
- Yeah.

36:26.765 --> 36:28.076
Hey, girls.

36:28.757 --> 36:30.390
Can I talk to Jules for a second?

36:30.755 --> 36:32.434
I'm just gonna put her necklace on.

36:33.688 --> 36:36.366
- You know, I can do it. I'll do it.
- I think I can get it.

36:36.526 --> 36:38.315
That's all right. Honey, I can do it.

36:38.669 --> 36:40.988
- She looks beautiful.
- I know.

36:53.455 --> 36:56.216
I was thinkin' about
you were right about something.

36:58.273 --> 36:59.407
About what?

37:00.463 --> 37:02.515
I do want a great family picture today.

37:10.342 --> 37:13.420
I think that's why this whole
christening has been so important to me,

37:13.628 --> 37:14.955
is because,

37:15.900 --> 37:16.900
you know,

37:20.357 --> 37:21.721
I want our family back.

37:25.213 --> 37:26.363
I want you back.

37:29.721 --> 37:31.153
And now we have Gracie,

37:32.124 --> 37:33.444
and Gracie's part of it.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.288
And today's about
bringing her into that.

37:37.385 --> 37:38.979
But you being the godmother,

37:40.616 --> 37:43.290
it's 'cause, you know,
when she was born, I thought to myself

37:43.450 --> 37:46.924
this is the luckiest girl in the world,
cause she has Julie as her older sister.

37:48.499 --> 37:51.429
You are the most special person
in the world

37:52.058 --> 37:55.007
and so, today, for me,

37:55.207 --> 37:56.891
why it's been such a big deal...

38:00.864 --> 38:02.579
is 'cause today

38:04.208 --> 38:07.066
I'm gonna be able to celebrate

38:08.191 --> 38:09.943
my two amazing daughters.

38:21.119 --> 38:22.469
I love you, honey.

38:25.719 --> 38:27.454
I'm sorry for earlier.

38:30.572 --> 38:31.708
It's okay.

38:36.176 --> 38:38.746
- Who has the baby, y'all?
- I have the baby.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.684
- Okay, good.
- Did you take the quiches off?

38:42.844 --> 38:44.650
Oh, gosh. Oh, good.
Julie did it. Thank you.

38:44.810 --> 38:45.808
I got it.

38:45.968 --> 38:48.001
They need to be brown on top.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.281
- They're kinda like green
- Hey, hon.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.783
Honey, come here. Come here.

38:54.643 --> 38:56.447
- Honey.
- What?

38:56.933 --> 39:00.374
Well, I think Tim Riggins
is parked out in front of our house.

39:00.753 --> 39:02.423
It looks like he's asleep.

39:02.890 --> 39:05.557
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know what it's all about.

39:05.887 --> 39:08.582
Do you think I should put these out now,
or should I wait until we're back?

39:52.781 --> 39:55.553
Will you take this, son?

39:56.045 --> 39:57.055
You got that?

39:57.317 --> 39:59.599
I've been looking for,
maybe, do something with it.

40:04.923 --> 40:06.279
Right there.

40:09.621 --> 40:11.710
Smash those peanuts. That's good.

40:18.209 --> 40:19.869
Not for eating. It's for puttinng it in.

40:24.177 --> 40:26.307
Christening is our acknowledgment

40:26.514 --> 40:31.006
that this little one is included
in God's unconditional love.

40:31.708 --> 40:34.684
Today, Gracie Belle reminds us of

40:34.844 --> 40:37.060
God's unconditional love for all of us.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.140
Love, and forgiveness,

40:40.413 --> 40:42.767
and new life given by our Lord.

40:57.939 --> 41:01.367
We welcome the newest member
of our church family,

41:01.568 --> 41:03.788
the newest member of God's family.

41:04.274 --> 41:06.343
Gracie Belle Taylor.

41:55.752 --> 41:57.592
They're not pressing charges.

42:12.614 --> 42:13.717
Thank God.
