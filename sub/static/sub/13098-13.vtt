'Shall I download station logs
for past six hours?'

00:31.667 --> 00:36.417
[groans]
Sure. Grab it, store it,
shove it.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.542
[female automated voice]
'Clarification?'

00:38.625 --> 00:41.917
[sighs]
Never mind.

00:46.125 --> 00:49.208
Why does my mouth always taste
like old carpet in the morning?

- Morning, Lt. commander.
- Commander.

01:04.375 --> 01:07.875
- Sleep well?
- Sleeping is not the problem.

01:07.958 --> 01:10.667
Waking up. That is a problem.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.167
I've always a hard time getting
up when it's dark outside.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.500
- But in space it's always dark.
- I know.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.208
I know.

01:19.292 --> 01:21.083
Picking up a distress signal.

01:21.167 --> 01:22.542

We were escorting transport,
hit by Raiders. Surprise attack.

They're in pursuit.
Power at 50 percent.

01:38.458 --> 01:42.333
Launch Delta Wing.
Tell them home in on his signal.

01:42.417 --> 01:43.958
(male #1)
They're coming in!

01:44.042 --> 01:46.333
Taking evasive action.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.417
Now they're all over the place!

(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:00.292 --> 02:03.167
10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.375
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:06.458 --> 02:10.250
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

02:10.333 --> 02:11.792
where humans and aliens could

02:11.875 --> 02:14.208
work out their
differences peacefully.

02:14.292 --> 02:17.042
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:17.125 --> 02:22.208
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:22.292 --> 02:26.750
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

02:26.833 --> 02:32.083
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

02:32.167 --> 02:34.167
It can be a dangerous place.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.250
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:37.333 --> 02:41.292
This is the story of the
last of the Babylon stations.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.708
The year is 2258.

02:43.792 --> 02:48.000
The name of the place
is "Babylon 5."

03:45.000 --> 03:47.125
Identicard, please.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.250
This hasn't been updated
in a while.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.292
I've been out of circulation.

03:55.375 --> 03:59.042
Spent the last few years doing
some exploration out on the rim.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.958
Find anything interesting?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.667
Yes.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.208
By the time the search
and rescue team got there

04:07.292 --> 04:09.333
there wasn't much left.

'Security analysis?'

04:10.917 --> 04:13.125
Even after we cut off
their supply of heavy weapons

04:13.208 --> 04:15.500
the Raiders have continued
to escalate their attacks.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.208
The last two have been in
close proximity to Babylon 5.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.667
We can't let this go on.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.000
If we can't guarantee safe
passage to the station--

04:22.083 --> 04:23.833
(Susan)
I know. Just two problems.

04:23.917 --> 04:25.875
One, by the time we hear
about an attack and progress

04:25.958 --> 04:27.625
it's too late
to do anything about it.

04:27.708 --> 04:30.500
Two, we can't figure out
how they're getting out so fast.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.500
Ships that small have to use
jump-gates same as anybody else.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.125
Getting from the point
of the last attack to

04:35.208 --> 04:37.750
the nearest gate takes
four hours at maximum burn.

04:37.833 --> 04:39.292
But they were gone
in less than two.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.500
Put Delta Wing on standby alert.

04:41.583 --> 04:42.583
They should be ready
to leave the second

04:42.667 --> 04:44.083
we hear about any new attack.

04:44.167 --> 04:46.000
Lt. commander, you'll take
first tactical watch.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.083
Will do, also recommend
we put together

04:48.167 --> 04:50.750
a profile of all incoming ships
for the next few weeks.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.875
See who's carrying
any valuable cargo

04:52.958 --> 04:55.042
if we can figure out
who they're likely to hit next.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.333
Agreed. See to it?

04:57.417 --> 04:58.750
(Garibaldi)
'It'll be tough.'

04:58.833 --> 05:00.542
Not everyone files
a complete manifest.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.000
A lot of them just flat-out lie.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.333
All we can do is
try to help them.

05:03.417 --> 05:04.875
If they won't cooperate

05:04.958 --> 05:08.417
then they'll just have
to accept the consequences.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.083
That's all.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.792
Mr. Garibaldi,
a moment of your time?

05:18.458 --> 05:20.458
Not long ago,
something happened.

05:20.542 --> 05:24.625
I've been keeping it to myself,
but the truth is..

05:24.708 --> 05:26.375
...I need some help.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.708
Mostly, I need a friend.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.125
You got both. What's the deal?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.250
I told you about
the Battle of the Line

05:35.333 --> 05:39.000
the 24 hours of my life
that I couldn't remember.

05:39.083 --> 05:42.083
Lately, I've started to
piece together a few things.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.667
Not all of it, just enough

05:43.750 --> 05:46.750
to know that something
happened to me back there.

05:48.167 --> 05:50.417
I've gone as far as I can
with my own investigation

05:50.500 --> 05:54.042
but...this is more
your area of expertise.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.333
I need your help

05:57.417 --> 06:00.250
to try and find out
what happened

06:00.333 --> 06:01.500
and why.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.167
This is strictly unofficial.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.375
You don't have to take
on the job if you don't want to.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.875
Jeff, this is me, remember?

06:13.792 --> 06:15.250
So, let's hear it.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.917
Start at the beginning,
and don't leave anything out.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.875
[chuckles]

06:23.583 --> 06:25.875
[instrumental music]

06:28.875 --> 06:30.958
- Ambassador.
- Mr. Reno?

06:31.042 --> 06:33.625
I was starting to worry
if you were going to come.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.792
I always keep
my end of the bargain.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.833
Just had to make sure
your people did the same.

06:37.917 --> 06:39.125
And?

06:39.208 --> 06:41.583
I finally received confirmation
that payment in full

06:41.667 --> 06:44.625
has been deposited
into my account back on Earth.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.125
'Here's the merchandise.'

06:55.667 --> 06:57.000
Great Maker.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.958
Nice piece of jewelry,
isn't it?

06:59.042 --> 07:01.667
This is not a piece of jewelry.

07:01.750 --> 07:05.208
This is not "The merchandise."

07:05.292 --> 07:08.667
This is the Eye

07:08.750 --> 07:11.833
the oldest symbol
of Centauri nobility.

07:11.917 --> 07:15.000
The property of
the very first emperor.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.375
It comes from the earliest days
of the Republic

07:17.458 --> 07:21.292
lost over a 100 years ago
at the Battle of Nu'Shok.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.458
I know the story, ambassador

07:23.542 --> 07:26.583
and I'm glad it means
something to you.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.083
But to me, it's just
another commission.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.833
My job is to find things

07:30.917 --> 07:33.458
objects, people, you name it.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.458
Now I've got my payment.

07:37.542 --> 07:40.042
- I'll be on my way.
- Payment indeed.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.125
My government paid enough
to buy a small planet.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.667
But I would very much
like to know

07:44.750 --> 07:46.792
how you got your hands on this.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.292
No, you wouldn't.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.292
[instrumental music]

08:07.583 --> 08:09.792
[intense music]

08:24.792 --> 08:28.333
- Ambassador.
- Ambassador.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.458
I have already pushed it.

08:33.542 --> 08:36.000
I pushed it again.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.542
Ah!

08:39.667 --> 08:43.667
I hear there is a famine on
your world Southern Frontier.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.083
My condolences.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.375
You should have thought of that

08:48.458 --> 08:51.250
before you strip mined
our resources.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.667
Ah! So it is all our fault? Hmm?

08:53.750 --> 08:54.833
Precisely.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.708
Though I have noticed
that your own people

08:56.792 --> 08:59.583
have continued to exploit
your world's resources

08:59.667 --> 09:02.750
to build the mighty
Narn war machine.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.125
We have to protect ourselves!

09:04.208 --> 09:06.708
By doing to yourselves
what you say we did to you?

09:06.792 --> 09:09.500
- Ah! That's evolution for you!
- Now, see here--

09:09.583 --> 09:12.292
Take the famine as a blessing,
ambassador.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.875
A weeding out
of the excess population.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.625
One more comment like that,
Mollari

09:16.708 --> 09:18.792
and you will become
part of the excess population!

09:18.875 --> 09:21.125
- Hah! Threats!
- Yes, threats!

09:21.208 --> 09:22.792
Now, you can go to hell!

09:22.875 --> 09:26.125
And you can kiss my pouch, you..

09:26.208 --> 09:28.667
- Now look what you made me do!
- Now look what you made me do!

09:28.750 --> 09:31.083
[instrumental music]

09:31.167 --> 09:33.458
And I can only assume that
once they were finished with me

09:33.542 --> 09:35.167
the Minbari wiped my memory

09:35.250 --> 09:37.042
being taken aboard
their cruiser.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.375
Put me back in my ship
and let me go.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.625
And you're sure
that was Delenn you saw?

09:42.708 --> 09:44.417
Positive.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.917
[exhales]
Eleven years since the war,
Jeff, it's a long time.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.542
- Trail's pretty cold.
- I know.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.417
And I don't expect you to come
up with anything today.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.042
I've waited 11 years,
I can wait a while longer.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.583
- But if you get any ideas..
- Understood.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.500
I'll keep my eyes open.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.167
And, Jeff,
thanks for trusting me enough

10:02.250 --> 10:03.750
to bring me in on this.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.125
Don't thank me until we figure
out where this thing goes.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.875
We may both end up
regretting this conversation.

10:09.958 --> 10:12.417
[instrumental music]

10:16.667 --> 10:20.625
(G'Kar)
'I'm not sure I understand
the question, uh, Mr..'

10:20.708 --> 10:23.083
- Morden.
- Morden, yes.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.708
Who did you say authorized
this little chat?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.333
Counselor T'Bar, First Circle.

10:29.417 --> 10:31.708
And does he know
what this is about?

10:31.792 --> 10:33.250
No.

10:33.333 --> 10:38.375
But in order to, uh...see
someone of your prominence

10:38.458 --> 10:40.792
I had to get a recommendation.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.083
He provided it.

10:43.167 --> 10:46.417
You still haven't answered
my question, ambassador.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.792
What do you want?

10:47.875 --> 10:50.833
Well, what do you mean
what do I want ?

10:50.917 --> 10:53.250
- What do you want?
- W.. What do I want for supper?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.000
What do I want do this evening?
What do I--

10:55.083 --> 10:57.708
What do you want?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.292
This is pointless.

10:59.375 --> 11:03.542
What I want is for you to
go away and leave me in peace.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.500
As you say.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.958
W-wait.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.208
[instrumental music]

11:22.167 --> 11:24.292
What do I want?

11:24.375 --> 11:27.250
The Centauri stripped my world.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.417
I want justice.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.083
But what do you want?

11:31.167 --> 11:33.917
To suck the marrow
from their bones

11:34.000 --> 11:36.583
and grind their skulls
to powder.

11:36.667 --> 11:37.958
What do you want?

11:38.042 --> 11:41.458
To tear down their cities,
blacken their sky

11:41.542 --> 11:43.875
sow their ground with salt.

11:43.958 --> 11:47.208
To completely,
utterly erase them.

11:47.292 --> 11:49.083
And then what?

11:49.167 --> 11:51.208
W..

11:53.875 --> 11:56.667
[sighs]
I don't know.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.958
As long as my Homeworld's
safety is guaranteed

12:01.042 --> 12:04.250
I don't know that it matters.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.417
I see.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.833
Well, thank you very much
for your time, ambassador.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.292
Good day.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.208
[instrumental music]

12:16.208 --> 12:18.625

12:25.375 --> 12:28.042
[speaking in foreign language]

12:35.375 --> 12:38.292
- Ambassador Mollari?
- Yes, Lord Kiro.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.542
I am honored.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.333
This is Ladira, my aunt

12:42.417 --> 12:45.250
also the seer and prophetess
of our house.

12:45.333 --> 12:48.208
- Ambassador.
- My lady.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.333
You are alright?

12:50.417 --> 12:52.833
Yes, the trip was quite long.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.792
(Londo)
'It can be quite a strain'

12:54.875 --> 12:58.000
if you're not used
to such voyages.

12:58.083 --> 13:02.375
Little rest will help.
I've made all the arrangements.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.125
You have the Eye?

13:04.208 --> 13:05.792
Yes. It's quite--

13:05.875 --> 13:09.375
[gasps]
This place..

13:09.458 --> 13:11.417
Great Maker, this place..

13:12.708 --> 13:14.792
- 'No.'
- Lady?

13:14.875 --> 13:18.750
I see death. Destruction.

13:18.833 --> 13:23.542
Fire. Babylon will fall.
This place will be destroyed!

13:23.625 --> 13:26.042
'Fire, death, pain.'

13:26.125 --> 13:30.792
Fire, death, pain.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.083
No.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.625
No!

13:37.667 --> 13:39.625
[dramatic music]

13:46.833 --> 13:48.917
[instrumental music]

13:56.583 --> 13:59.750
- You're sure you're alright?
- I'm fine, Kiro.

13:59.833 --> 14:03.542
It was a vision.
Very powerful.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.917
You said this place
will be destroyed?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.208
Yes. Yes, I did.

14:09.292 --> 14:10.917
You'll excuse me.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.667
I must go to my quarters
and rest.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.333
You'll forgive my aunt.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.917
She sometimes takes the role
of prophetess too seriously.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.167
Then you don't believe
her vision?

14:26.250 --> 14:28.167
She's been wrong before.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.625
On my first birthday

14:29.708 --> 14:32.917
she said that someday
I would be killed by shadows.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.167
[chuckles]
Shadows?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.292
Doesn't exactly make sense,
does it?

14:37.375 --> 14:38.458
No.

14:40.167 --> 14:43.000
- Where is the Eye?
- Safe.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.750
I would like to see it.

14:44.833 --> 14:46.333
Well, actually I was told--

14:46.417 --> 14:49.500
My family has been waiting
for over a 100 years

14:49.583 --> 14:51.542
for the Eye to be returned.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.667
It is the symbol of our house

14:53.750 --> 14:57.750
a house of nobility and honor.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.833
And now I must play
the messenger.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.750
After searching for so long,
I would like to spend

15:05.833 --> 15:07.708
some time with it

15:07.792 --> 15:10.000
before turning it over
to the emperor.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.833
Of course.

15:16.042 --> 15:18.500
[instrumental music]

15:22.208 --> 15:25.833
Six to One, have located target.
Commencing surveillance.

15:28.958 --> 15:34.417
What is the purpose of your
question, Mr. Morden, is it?

15:34.500 --> 15:38.500
The question is its own purpose,
Ambassador Delenn.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.167
What do you want?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.833
I am informed that you have
just seen Ambassador G'Kar.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.583
Are you asking each of us
this question?

15:46.667 --> 15:48.250
Perhaps.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.042
Does that invalidate
the question?

15:50.125 --> 15:53.542
No, but it makes me wonder..

15:57.292 --> 15:59.833
Something wrong, ambassador?

15:59.917 --> 16:03.583
No, just a moment of fatigue.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.167
[instrumental music]

16:10.667 --> 16:12.750
Ambassador?

16:12.833 --> 16:14.125
Leave me.

16:17.417 --> 16:20.167
Get out. Now!

16:22.792 --> 16:24.750
[instrumental music]

16:35.375 --> 16:37.500
They're here.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.750
[Kiro grunts]

16:45.833 --> 16:48.167
(Kiro)
Yes.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.333
No one else knows
that it's here?

16:58.417 --> 17:01.583
No one, except the man
who brought it here.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.833
I think we can rely
on his discretion.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.042
Good.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.708
Good. We'll, uh..

17:08.792 --> 17:11.750
We'll bring it back
just as quietly.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.708
It will be better for
the government to declare

17:13.792 --> 17:16.250
that they found it back home

17:16.333 --> 17:19.875
rather than to admit they had
to buy it from some outsider.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.750
[sighs]

17:23.833 --> 17:25.000
Ambassador..

17:26.542 --> 17:31.208
..you must know that things are,
uh...changing back home.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.000
I hear a few things.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.125
(Kiro)
'Every day our people
grow unhappier'

17:35.208 --> 17:37.375
'with our so-called leaders.'

17:37.458 --> 17:40.292
The emperor has not appeared
in public for a nearly a year

17:40.375 --> 17:41.958
leaving his prime minister
to act for him

17:42.042 --> 17:43.958
but w-without his leadership

17:44.042 --> 17:46.167
the senate continues
to lose credibility.

17:46.250 --> 17:50.708
Ah! So that is why they were so
desperate to find the Eye, yes?

17:50.792 --> 17:52.000
(Kiro)
'Yes.'

17:52.083 --> 17:55.417
There is no greater symbol
of authority.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.917
Mollari..

18:01.000 --> 18:03.917
...the Eye belongs
to my family

18:04.000 --> 18:05.875
my house.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.708
Why should I give it
to the emperor?

18:09.792 --> 18:12.542
We must all make
our sacrifices.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.667
If I were to return
with the Eye..

18:16.750 --> 18:19.167
...and claim the throne
for myself?

18:19.250 --> 18:23.833
Lord Kiro, please.
I understand your feelings.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.375
You could do what you describe

18:25.458 --> 18:29.167
but without support you would be
dead within a day of trying.

18:29.250 --> 18:33.458
These are no longer
the good old days, Lord Kiro.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.583
Yes.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.792
More's the pity.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.542
I'll leave this
in your care tonight.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.375
For it were in my possession,
I might do something foolish.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.625
- Goodnight.
- 'Goodnight.'

18:55.375 --> 18:57.917
'Where did it all go wrong,
Mollari?'

18:59.250 --> 19:01.708
Where did we lose it all?

19:01.792 --> 19:05.500
[chuckles]
I don't know.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.792
I don't know.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.375
[door slides open]

19:14.458 --> 19:16.667
[instrumental music]

19:21.292 --> 19:23.417
- Send everyone to the shuttle.
- Evacuate, evacuate!

19:23.500 --> 19:25.375
- We've lost authority team--
- Team Alpha has cut off!

19:25.458 --> 19:27.042
(male #1)
They're heading
for the docking bays!

19:27.125 --> 19:28.417
- Repeat, they're heading--
- Hit it!

19:28.500 --> 19:29.917
Hit it with everything
you've got!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.542
- We've got to get out!
- The shuttle's away--

19:31.625 --> 19:34.500
(male #2))
Destruct! Destruct! Destruct!

19:34.583 --> 19:37.083
[thinking indistinct chatter]

19:37.167 --> 19:39.250
[explosions]

19:43.958 --> 19:46.958
(male #3)
'Captain, we're picking up
Raider transmissions.'

19:47.042 --> 19:48.750
Impossible.
The screens are clear.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.167
There's nothing out there.

19:51.667 --> 19:52.917
'Hey, where are they
coming from?'

19:53.000 --> 19:54.917
- I don't know.
- Time to target?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.167
Twenty minutes.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.792
Battle stations,
thrusters to maximum.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.250
We'll try to beat them
to the jump-gate.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.417
Earth Transport Vessel Achilles
to all ships in Grid Epsilon.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.250
This is Earth Transport
Vessel Achilles

20:06.333 --> 20:07.458
to all ships in Grid Epsilon.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.917
This is a mayday.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.083
'Repeat, this is a mayday.
We are under attack.'

20:11.167 --> 20:13.500
'We are surrounded by Raiders.
This is a mayday.'

20:13.583 --> 20:15.417
'We're moving in flight speed
to the jump-gate.'

20:15.500 --> 20:17.667
'Come on, guys, we could
use your help out here!'

20:17.750 --> 20:20.125
'This is a mayday,
repeat, mayday!'

20:20.208 --> 20:21.333
Standby, Achilles.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.833
- Help's on the way.
- 'Roger that.'

20:22.917 --> 20:24.667
Lt. Commander,
you're clear to launch.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.208
Confirmed.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.958
You heard the man, Delta Wing,
hit it.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.000
[whooshing]

20:33.458 --> 20:35.958

'Call Red-7, 3-5..'

20:56.542 --> 20:58.375
Six to one.
they've taken the bait.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.167
Estimate two hours until
they can reload the Cobra bays.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.708
Keep them busy once they arrive.

21:03.792 --> 21:06.125
We'll take care
of Babylon 5 from this end.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.958
[intense music]

21:26.542 --> 21:28.667
(male #1 on radio)
'You are clear to dock
in Bay 13.'

21:28.750 --> 21:30.667
'Welcome back, Ambassador Kosh.'

21:30.750 --> 21:32.625
[instrumental music]

21:33.917 --> 21:36.625
[door slides open]

22:00.833 --> 22:02.375
[music continues]

22:04.833 --> 22:06.625
[sizzling]

22:14.792 --> 22:18.250
Time to target's last
known position, 20 minutes.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.167
Any further transmissions
from the Achilles?

22:20.250 --> 22:22.750
Confirmed, still reading her,
Delta Leader.

22:22.833 --> 22:25.167
Alright, let's hope we're
in time to do some good.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.375
'Delta 7 and 8, stay behind
and watch the gate.'

22:27.458 --> 22:28.875
'If the Raiders
manage to double back'

22:28.958 --> 22:30.667
'and to get past us, link in.'

22:30.750 --> 22:31.917
'I wanna know how the hell
they're getting in'

22:32.000 --> 22:33.167
'and outta here so fast.'

22:33.250 --> 22:35.667
(male #4 on radio)
'Will do.'

22:37.250 --> 22:39.500
Maximum burn.
Weapons systems on standby.

22:39.583 --> 22:40.958
Heat 'em up.
We're gonna need 'em.

22:41.042 --> 22:43.792
(male #4 on radio)
'Confirmed, Delta Leader.'

22:43.875 --> 22:45.708
We're ready to proceed.

22:45.792 --> 22:48.083
Bring the Eye, please,
and we'll meet along on the way.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.875
Good. I've notified Centauri
Prime of your expected arrival.

22:51.958 --> 22:54.583
There'll be a ship waiting
to escort you home.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.667
You'll have protection
every step of the way

22:56.750 --> 22:57.958
once you're through the gate.

22:58.042 --> 22:59.667
Well, I should hope so.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.375
See you in a few moments,
ambassador.

23:14.542 --> 23:17.625
Ah, ambassador, I was just
on my way to see you.

23:17.708 --> 23:18.958
- My name is--
- I'm sorry.

23:19.042 --> 23:21.000
But I don't have time
to chat right now.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.458
I suggest you make
an appointment.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.833
- I did.
- Then make another one.

23:26.042 --> 23:28.375
Never a transport tube
when you need one.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.625
Ambassador, I was authorized
to speak to you--

23:30.708 --> 23:33.458
Yes, yes.
Look, what do you want?

23:33.542 --> 23:35.208
That's what I was going
to ask you.

23:35.292 --> 23:36.958
What do you want?

23:37.042 --> 23:38.917
You are a lunatic. Go away.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.042
Pester someone else.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.917
[female automated voice]
'Destination?'

23:46.000 --> 23:47.792
Bay 12.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.667
You are a very
persistent young man.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.000
I have to be.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.333
I'm not allowed
to leave you until

23:53.417 --> 23:55.250
you've answered my question.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.667
- What do you want?
- This is a silly conversation.

23:58.750 --> 24:00.833
Yes, it is.

24:00.917 --> 24:04.375
- What do you want?
- To be left alone.

24:05.958 --> 24:09.167
Is that it?
Is that really all, ambassador?

24:09.250 --> 24:11.458
[sighs]

24:11.542 --> 24:14.667
Alright. Fine.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.417
You really want to know
what I want?

24:17.500 --> 24:20.417
You really want to
know the truth?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.708
I want my people to reclaim

24:22.792 --> 24:25.792
their rightful place
in the galaxy.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.292
I want to see the Centauri

24:27.375 --> 24:31.708
stretch forth their hand again
and command the stars.

24:31.792 --> 24:34.042
I-I want a rebirth of glory

24:34.125 --> 24:36.667
a renaissance of power.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.792
I want to stop
running through my life

24:38.875 --> 24:40.958
like a man late
for an appointment

24:41.042 --> 24:45.083
afraid to, to look back,
or to look forward.

24:45.167 --> 24:48.500
I want us to be
what we used to be.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.333
I want..

24:52.958 --> 24:56.917
I want it all back
the way that it was.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.667
Does that answer your question?

25:04.500 --> 25:07.667
Yes. Yes, it does.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.958
Commander, we just received
confirmation from Delta Wing.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.750
They're closing in on the
Achilles' last known position.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.042
Good.

25:19.292 --> 25:21.167
Something wrong, commander?

25:21.250 --> 25:23.750
Up until now,
the Raiders have been hitting

25:23.833 --> 25:25.792
closer to Babylon 5,
but this new attack

25:25.875 --> 25:28.083
is almost a full sector
further away.

25:28.167 --> 25:29.750
Call up a cargo manifest
on the Achilles.

25:29.833 --> 25:32.583
- Let's see what she's carrying.
- On it.

25:38.042 --> 25:40.000
That's far enough.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.708
[sizzling]

25:43.875 --> 25:45.125
I want the Eye.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.917
We don't know
what you're talking about!

25:48.000 --> 25:50.500
No more lies, ambassador.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.417
And to make sure
there are no further problems

25:52.500 --> 25:54.792
you three have just
become hostages.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.458
Get this aboard the ship.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.167
And hide these bodies.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.625
We don't want them found
until we're clear.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.458
Now, move.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.500
[intense music]

26:10.542 --> 26:14.125
Commander, I have the cargo
information you asked for.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.667
Are you sure this manifest
covers everything?

26:20.750 --> 26:21.750
Yes, sir.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.375
"Hydroponics supplies, tools

26:23.458 --> 26:25.125
atmospheric-testing materials."

26:25.208 --> 26:26.833
There's nothing here
that would bring a high price

26:26.917 --> 26:28.333
in the black market.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.833
Nothing worth the effort
of stealing it.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.542
Then why the attack?

26:34.083 --> 26:37.208
Babylon Control to Delta Wing.
Do you copy, Delta Leader?

26:37.292 --> 26:39.917
- Confirmed, Babylon Control.
- 'What's your status?'

26:40.000 --> 26:41.542
We just got word the Raiders
have broken off the attack.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.083
We're flying in pursuit.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.792
(Jeffrey on radio)
'Negative, Delta Leader.
Do not pursue.'

26:44.875 --> 26:47.333
Repeat, do not pursue.
Return to base.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.500
- But, commander--
- 'It's a diversion, Lt. Cmdr.'

26:49.583 --> 26:51.667
They want your forces as far
from the station as possible.

26:51.750 --> 26:55.250
- Return to base at once.
- 'Confirmed, Babylon Control.'

27:03.000 --> 27:06.583
What ships are due to arrive or
depart in the next two hours?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.167
Traffic's light.

27:08.250 --> 27:12.375
Just a couple survey ships
and a Centauri personal liner.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.625
Registration?

27:15.083 --> 27:16.875
A Lord Kiro and Lady Ladira.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.625
Scheduled to depart
Bay 12 in 10 minutes.

27:19.708 --> 27:22.375
That might be it. Tell Garibaldi
to stand by with Alpha wing.

27:22.458 --> 27:24.125
I'm heading for Bay 12.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.875
Ambassador , the ship of yours
that's about to depart--

27:33.958 --> 27:36.042
Commander,
this is not a good time.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.542
I have to warn you.
We received information--

27:38.625 --> 27:41.042
Commander, look out!

27:42.542 --> 27:45.542
Alright, if anyone moves,
Lord Kiro gets his

27:45.625 --> 27:47.417
brain splattered
all over the bulkhead.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.208
'Now, I'm taking this ship,
and we're leaving here.'

27:50.292 --> 27:52.583
And if anybody tries
to block the docking bay

27:52.667 --> 27:53.750
I'll use the ship's thrusters

27:53.833 --> 27:55.583
and burn my way through,
understood?

27:55.667 --> 27:59.083
Understood.
We won't try to stop you.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.417
I'd always heard
you were a smart man, Sinclair.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.917
Now, move!

28:05.000 --> 28:07.750
Kiro! Kiro, no!

28:07.833 --> 28:11.500
Commander, what are you doing?
You can't just let him go!

28:11.583 --> 28:13.083
Garibaldi,
a Centauri liner will be

28:13.167 --> 28:14.917
coming out of the docking bay
in about five minutes.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.167
Target engines only.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.875
'I want it disabled,
not destroyed.'

28:17.958 --> 28:19.958
(Garibaldi)
'Confirmed.
Launching Alpha Wing.'

28:20.042 --> 28:22.583
We'll program the jump-gate
to reject the ship's ID code.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.375
We'll let 'em get outside
to keep 'em from damaging

28:24.458 --> 28:26.083
the station,
but once they're outside

28:26.167 --> 28:29.417
believe me,
they're not going anywhere.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.250
Ladira, we should
get away from here.

28:31.333 --> 28:35.000
The Shadows..
the Shadows are coming for him.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.333
[instrumental music]

28:42.875 --> 28:44.667
- Status?
- Centauri Liner's out.

28:44.750 --> 28:47.292
And trying to activate
jump-gate sequence.

28:47.375 --> 28:48.917
Alright, Mr. Garibaldi, move in.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.625
- Hit them and reel them in.
- Will do.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.542
Okay, people, let's move.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.292
[instrumental music]

29:02.667 --> 29:05.000
The ship's too small to make
it's own jump point.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.167
And with our jump-gate closed

29:06.250 --> 29:07.875
the nearest one is
six light-months away

29:07.958 --> 29:09.708
and Garibaldi at his back

29:09.792 --> 29:11.292
we got 'em boxed in
on all sides.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.333
We can wait him out,
if we have to.

29:13.417 --> 29:16.292
Commander, jump point
forming in Sector 3.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.542
What?

29:28.250 --> 29:31.500
So that's how the Raiders
get in and out so fast.

29:31.583 --> 29:34.792
A vessel that size would have
to be capable of solo jumps.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.875
They're moving
in attack formation.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.417
Weapons systems locking on.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.958
Close blast doors.
Prepare for attack.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.667
[dramatic music]

29:57.292 --> 29:59.750
Level one alert!
Activate defense grids.

29:59.833 --> 30:01.750
Defense grids online.

30:04.625 --> 30:07.208
Alpha Leader, whatever is on
that ship, they want it bad.

30:07.292 --> 30:08.708
Make sure it doesn't get away.

30:08.792 --> 30:11.375
- What about the station?
- We can take care of ourselves.

30:11.458 --> 30:13.208
- Now, go.
- 'Roger.'

30:13.292 --> 30:14.833
[gunshots]

30:19.292 --> 30:21.625
Alright, Alpha Wing.
Take them down hard.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.792
[instrumental music]

30:26.625 --> 30:28.750
[clamoring]

30:36.208 --> 30:37.750
Ladira.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.167
Ladira, we have to find shelter.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.750
Fire. Death and destruction.

30:42.833 --> 30:44.542
You can't stay here.

30:44.625 --> 30:48.000
- Come with me now. Please.
- It doesn't matter.

30:48.083 --> 30:51.292
The Shadows have come
for Lord Kiro.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.708
The Shadows have come
for us all.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
[alarm blaring]

31:03.917 --> 31:05.250
[gunshots]

31:31.667 --> 31:36.417
Leave this place.
They are not for you.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.167
Go.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.375
Leave.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.625
Now.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.500
[electricity crackling]

31:47.875 --> 31:50.458
(Garibaldi)
'Commander, Centauri transport
heading for the mother ship.'

31:50.542 --> 31:51.792
'Unable to pursue.'

31:51.875 --> 31:54.042
[instrumental music]

32:03.500 --> 32:04.833
[explosion]

32:04.917 --> 32:06.375
Alpha Leader to Alpha Wing

32:06.458 --> 32:09.500
these things are made for
atmosphere and lower space.

32:09.583 --> 32:12.042
'Go for the airfoils, that's
where they're vulnerable.'

32:12.125 --> 32:14.667
[gunshots]

32:14.750 --> 32:17.250
Recalibrate the defense grid
along the cargo bay

32:17.333 --> 32:19.250
for long-range firing pattern.

32:19.333 --> 32:22.083
'Range, between two
and five kilometers spread.'

32:22.167 --> 32:23.667
I'll have to take it
off-line for a minute.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.458
(Jeffrey)
'Do it.'

32:27.000 --> 32:28.542
Babylon Control to Alpha leader

32:28.625 --> 32:30.875
'drive them toward
the back of the station.'

32:30.958 --> 32:32.000
Confirmed.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.875
[instrumental music]

32:39.667 --> 32:41.250
Let me know
when they're in position.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.917
- One minute.
- Defense grid reactivated.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.083
Target range: 3.9 kilometers.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.250
Now we close the box.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.125
Babylon Control to Delta Wing.

32:51.208 --> 32:53.750
- Proceed.
- 'Confirmed, Babylon Control.'

32:54.500 --> 32:56.250
[sizzling]

33:04.792 --> 33:06.083
Surprise.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.750
[instrumental music]

33:17.625 --> 33:19.167
Tactical display.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.500
- They're retreating.
- Good.

33:25.583 --> 33:28.167
Right down the middle
of the gauntlet.

33:30.958 --> 33:33.417
Delta Wing, fire!

33:33.500 --> 33:35.792
Alpha Wing, fire!

33:35.875 --> 33:37.583
'Fire defense grid,
all sectors!'

33:37.667 --> 33:39.125
[gunshots]

33:51.708 --> 33:54.208
That's got them.

33:54.292 --> 33:56.750
Delta Wing, proceed to
command and control vessel

33:56.833 --> 33:58.583
while Alpha Wing
works clean up.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.083
Confirmed.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.292
[sizzling]

34:11.125 --> 34:12.625
Damn.

34:12.708 --> 34:15.000
Delta Leader to Babylon Control,
they're opening a jump point.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.417
Repeat, they're opening
a jump point.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.625
'Going to maximum thrust!'

34:17.708 --> 34:19.417
Negative. Delta Leader.
Abandon pursuit.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.875
You might get caught
in the backwash!

34:20.958 --> 34:22.750
We've got their fighters,
don't risk it!

34:22.833 --> 34:24.083
Commander..

34:24.167 --> 34:26.500
(Jeffrey on radio)
'That's an order, Delta Leader!'

34:29.125 --> 34:31.625
Nuts.

34:31.708 --> 34:33.625
Delta Leader to Delta Wing,
Show's over.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.208
Let's collect the stragglers
and return to base.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.125
We figure eleven Raider ships
destroyed

34:43.208 --> 34:44.542
four damaged and captured.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.208
We're interrogating
the prisoners now.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.542
Station took some minor damage.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.917
We've got maintenance bots
working on it.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.500
A few injuries here and there,
nothing major.

34:52.583 --> 34:55.542
Well, it seems Ambassador Kosh's
encounter suit was damaged

34:55.625 --> 34:56.833
but he's not telling how.

34:56.917 --> 34:59.375
Just asked for some equipment
to have it fixed.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.625
What about our ships?

35:00.708 --> 35:02.000
(Garibaldi)
'Three Starfuries were disabled'

35:02.083 --> 35:03.958
and had to be towed back
for repair.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.542
We lost two ships, Jeff.

35:06.625 --> 35:09.500
'Alpha-6 managed to eject
in time. He's down in Medlab.'

35:09.583 --> 35:12.083
Doc thinks he'll be okay.

35:12.167 --> 35:14.083
Delta-9 didn't make it.

35:14.167 --> 35:16.000
You want me
to notify the family?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.542
No, I'll do it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.625
His father's back on Earth.
His sister's in the Mars colony.

35:21.708 --> 35:23.583
The information's all there.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.875
If it helps, it looks like
we hurt the Raiders bad.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.208
Maybe bad enough so that
we won't be seeing them again.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.875
They still got
their main vessel.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.625
(Garibaldi)
'Yeah, I know,
but without fighters'

35:31.708 --> 35:32.875
it's just one big target.

35:32.958 --> 35:34.375
They'll take a long time before

35:34.458 --> 35:37.583
they can gather enough fighters
to be a problem, if ever.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.708
Commander, you wanted to see us?

35:41.792 --> 35:43.250
Yes.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.583
The ship the Raiders captured

35:44.667 --> 35:46.625
was registered in your name,
Lady Ladira.

35:46.708 --> 35:48.292
They were after something
in your possession.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.417
'I'd like to know what it was,
what it was doing here'

35:50.500 --> 35:53.667
'and why it wasn't declared
on the cargo manifest?'

35:53.750 --> 35:56.875
It's a very long story,
commander.

35:56.958 --> 36:00.000
Well, my time is your time.

36:06.375 --> 36:08.667
[intense music]

36:14.458 --> 36:17.417
Very convincing performance
back there.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.667
Now, if you don't mind
please tell your captain--

36:19.750 --> 36:22.417
Sorry, he's busy.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.083
Stick him in holding
until we need him.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.500
What are you doing?
We had an agreement.

36:27.583 --> 36:30.167
Had. Past tense.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.667
Look, we're big.
We're organized.

36:32.750 --> 36:35.250
But in no way are we big enough
to help you knock over

36:35.333 --> 36:37.625
the Centauri government
and put you in charge.

36:37.708 --> 36:40.125
'I don't care how much leverage
you think the Eye gives you.'

36:40.208 --> 36:42.417
You think they're gonna follow
you just like that?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.917
- Not a chance.
- But I helped you.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.750
I gave you the transport
times --

36:46.833 --> 36:48.375
And we're grateful.

36:48.458 --> 36:51.625
This ship, big enough
to make its own jump point

36:51.708 --> 36:52.958
cost us nearly every credit

36:53.042 --> 36:56.042
we've stolen over
the last five years.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.542
'With the ransom
we can get for this'

36:57.625 --> 37:00.417
we can buy one
maybe even two more.

37:00.500 --> 37:04.792
That made it worth taking
the risk, not your plan.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.667
And what about me?

37:11.750 --> 37:15.125
You're gonna send a message
to Centauri Prime.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.500
They've met our demands
for the Eye

37:16.583 --> 37:18.625
but they won't consider
paying your ransom

37:18.708 --> 37:21.625
until they have proof
that you're still alive.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.625
So, look on the bright side,
Lord Kiro.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.125
You're not going home
as the new emperor.

37:27.208 --> 37:29.417
But you are going home alive.

37:29.500 --> 37:33.125
And once back,
you're gonna keep on paying us

37:33.208 --> 37:35.667
because you wouldn't want
anybody to find out about your..

37:35.750 --> 37:37.542
[siren blares]

37:37.625 --> 37:39.917
What the hell?

37:47.792 --> 37:49.625
[explosion]

37:51.417 --> 37:53.833
[shatters]

37:53.917 --> 37:56.042
[instrumental music]

38:06.167 --> 38:08.167
[instrumental music]

38:11.958 --> 38:14.375
You're sure you are well enough
to travel, my lady?

38:14.458 --> 38:17.083
I have responsibilities
I must attend to.

38:17.167 --> 38:18.875
And what of you, ambassador?

38:18.958 --> 38:21.333
What of me? Huh!

38:21.417 --> 38:24.542
It would seem my career
is finished, good lady.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.708
The Eye is gone.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.208
Even if they want to
buy it back

38:28.292 --> 38:30.000
the price will be astronomical.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.333
And I'm sorry.

38:31.417 --> 38:32.875
I'll do anything I can to help.

38:32.958 --> 38:34.333
Thank you.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.000
But I'm afraid
I'm beyond anything

38:36.083 --> 38:38.708
short of a miracle.

38:38.792 --> 38:40.792
Goodnight, Lady Ladira.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.042
I'll see you to your ship
in the morning.

38:43.125 --> 38:46.500
I expect I'll be leaving myself,
a few days later.

38:54.250 --> 38:57.083
[door beeping]

38:57.167 --> 38:59.583
Whoever it is, go away.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.125
[beeping continues]

39:01.208 --> 39:03.292
Alright.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.417
Alright.
What's one more annoyance?

39:06.500 --> 39:09.000
Enter.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.500
- Good evening, ambassador.
- You?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.167
Go away. It's late.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.833
I'm in no mood for your games.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.958
I'm leaving shortly.
I got what I came for.

39:18.042 --> 39:19.792
But before I go..

39:21.333 --> 39:25.042
A gift from friends
you don't know you have.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.667
[instrumental music]

39:36.750 --> 39:39.625
The Eye.

39:39.708 --> 39:42.250
[chuckles]
How?

39:47.125 --> 39:51.750
Where did you go, eh?
Let me buy you a drink.

39:51.833 --> 39:55.542
Let me buy you
an entire fleet of drinks!

39:55.625 --> 39:58.750
How can I ever find you
to thank you?

39:58.833 --> 40:03.875
(Morden)
'We will find you, ambassador.
We will find you.'

40:08.875 --> 40:10.583
[instrumental music]

40:13.375 --> 40:15.000
So, I've assigned
a couple of security guards

40:15.083 --> 40:16.625
to escort Ladira
back to her ship.

40:16.708 --> 40:19.042
Needless to say, Londo and I
had a little chat about

40:19.125 --> 40:20.583
withholding cargo information.

40:20.667 --> 40:21.750
If we'd known about the Eye

40:21.833 --> 40:23.292
we could've anticipated
the attack.

40:23.375 --> 40:24.458
No kidding.

40:24.542 --> 40:25.750
I was planning to stop by

40:25.833 --> 40:26.958
and make sure
they got off alright.

40:27.042 --> 40:28.375
- You coming?
- Na, I can't.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.083
I've got an Earthforce transport
due in about an hour

40:30.167 --> 40:32.167
to take the prisoners
back home for trial.

40:32.250 --> 40:33.458
They plan to make
a big deal outta this

40:33.542 --> 40:34.667
to try and discourage others.

40:34.750 --> 40:37.250
If it works, I'll take it.
Something else?

40:37.333 --> 40:40.042
On another matter
you asked me to look into.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.167
I dug around a little and..

40:45.250 --> 40:46.458
Look, Jeff..

40:48.167 --> 40:50.917
...you probably know you weren't
first in line to run this place.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.500
I suspected as much.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.625
I was surprised
when they called me.

40:54.708 --> 40:57.833
- How far down the list was I?
- Pretty far.

40:57.917 --> 40:58.958
Despite the problems,
this is still

40:59.042 --> 41:01.208
a high-profile job,
a real plum.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.375
Admiral, generals,
the whole brass was lined up

41:03.458 --> 41:05.333
hoping to get it,
but every name was rejected

41:05.417 --> 41:06.708
until they got to you.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.542
Rejected by whom?

41:08.625 --> 41:10.458
The Minbari government.

41:10.542 --> 41:12.875
They were the first to sign on
to support Babylon 5

41:12.958 --> 41:14.417
on the condition
that they had approval

41:14.500 --> 41:16.250
of who was assigned
to run this place.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.083
- They wanted you.
- Why?

41:19.167 --> 41:20.750
Unknown.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.708
Commander, I'm glad
you were able to come.

41:28.792 --> 41:31.083
I wanted to see you
before I left.

41:31.167 --> 41:32.875
I don't know if
Ambassador Mollari

41:32.958 --> 41:37.208
mentioned it to you or not,
but when I arrived here

41:37.292 --> 41:39.875
I had a vision about this place.

41:39.958 --> 41:42.625
He told me, but we came
through the attack at one piece.

41:42.708 --> 41:45.875
- The station is safe.
- For now.

41:45.958 --> 41:48.250
But the vision, commander..

41:48.333 --> 41:51.292
The vision is still there.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.750
It's not an easy thing

41:53.833 --> 41:55.958
but I can let you see..

41:57.583 --> 41:59.375
...if you will trust me.

41:59.458 --> 42:01.500
[dramatic music]

42:10.250 --> 42:13.083
[intense music]

42:27.667 --> 42:28.875
This..

42:30.292 --> 42:33.000
Is it a vision of what will be
or what might be?

42:33.083 --> 42:35.500
The future is always changing.

42:35.583 --> 42:37.583
We create the future

42:37.667 --> 42:39.792
with our words, our deeds

42:39.875 --> 42:42.667
and with our beliefs.

42:42.750 --> 42:45.750
This is a possible future,
commander.

42:45.833 --> 42:49.500
And it is my hope
that you may yet avoid it.

42:50.583 --> 42:52.083
[instrumental music]

43:10.500 --> 43:12.292
[theme music]

43:40.042 --> 43:41.958
[music continues]
