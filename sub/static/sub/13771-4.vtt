Reese, stop it.

You're going to give
yourself leprosy.

ABE:
Thank you so much

01:42.406 --> 01:44.539
for letting us be a part
of Dewey's birthday.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.410
You enjoying your
special day, son?

01:46.497 --> 01:48.847
I expect nothing,
and I'm still let down.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.327
It sure is.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.242
I hope you like
your present, honey.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.983
You know, birthdays are going
to be a little thin around here

01:54.070 --> 01:55.115
until we get back
on our feet.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.551
No, I love

01:56.638 --> 01:57.508
my Quarters of America.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.944
See, we started you out

01:59.031 --> 02:01.599
with California and Maine.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.428
Oops. These are
both Maine.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.735
Well, guess you won't
be needing this one.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.216
Where's Francis?

02:09.303 --> 02:11.218
He was supposed to be here
for my party.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.393
Oh, he called.
There was a TV show

02:12.480 --> 02:13.698
he wanted to
finish watching.

02:13.785 --> 02:14.917
He'll get here
after your bedtime.

Listen, I don't want

02:16.397 --> 02:18.050

02:18.138 --> 02:19.704
Don't worry about it.

Stevie has been chosen
to receive

02:23.882 --> 02:25.493
a Teen Courtesy Award!

02:25.580 --> 02:26.755
Oh!

02:26.842 --> 02:28.322
That's fantastic.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.236
I don't know anyone

02:29.323 --> 02:30.585
who deserves it more.

02:30.672 --> 02:31.629
What is it?

02:31.716 --> 02:33.196
The International

02:33.283 --> 02:36.373
Courtesy Association
is awarding him a Gallant.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.896
That's the award

02:37.983 --> 02:39.289
they give to the youngster
who best observes

02:39.376 --> 02:40.986
the teen courtesy pledge

02:41.073 --> 02:44.164
to be clean, quiet,
polite and obedient.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
Congratulations, Stevie.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.949
Thank you.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.996
Well, we're all
very proud of you, Stevie.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.347
I'd keep this courtesy
award to myself.

The award dinner's

02:57.525 --> 02:59.788

We want you all to come.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.747
You've been so good to us
through "the difficulties."

03:02.834 --> 03:04.488
You've been
just like family.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.881
How's the divorce going, Abe?

03:05.968 --> 03:07.404
Have you been able
to find Kitty?

03:07.491 --> 03:09.363
No address, but when
I searched the Internet

03:09.450 --> 03:11.321
I found some interesting
pictures of her.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.062
From what I could tell,
she seems to have

03:13.149 --> 03:15.151
overcome her fear
of meeting new people.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.935
But, hey, I'm looking forward.

03:17.022 --> 03:20.025
Why just yesterday, this cute
new teller at my bank

03:20.112 --> 03:22.245
-started flirting with me.
-Really?

03:22.332 --> 03:25.944
Get this. She told me I forgot
to "date" my check.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.469
"Date," Hal.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.515
Whoa.
[forced laugh]

03:31.602 --> 03:33.256
You excited about this
courtesy award?

03:33.343 --> 03:35.127
I'll need...

03:35.215 --> 03:38.000
your help...

03:39.654 --> 03:41.351
with my...

03:43.223 --> 03:44.876
acceptance speech.

03:44.963 --> 03:47.009
There are...

03:47.096 --> 03:49.403
so many...

03:49.490 --> 03:52.232
people to...

03:53.842 --> 03:55.800
thank.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.063
Have you thought about
a blanket thank you?

03:58.150 --> 03:59.978
I have...

04:00.065 --> 04:02.067
a plan.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.721
Oh, my God!
This is so cool!

04:03.808 --> 04:06.202
Did you know that
underneath your skin,

04:06.289 --> 04:07.899
there's more skin?

04:07.986 --> 04:11.076
Why have I always
been so careful?

04:15.559 --> 04:18.214
Thanks for a wonderful night.
You know what?

04:18.301 --> 04:20.738
I'm seriously thinking about
dropping by my bank tomorrow

04:20.825 --> 04:22.827
and asking that new teller
for some penny rolls.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.482
Hey, Mr. Hot Stuff,
save some for the other fellas.

04:25.569 --> 04:28.442
[both laughing]

04:28.529 --> 04:29.965
-Bye-bye, guys.
-Good night.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.445
ABE:
Bye. Come on, son.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.581
Kitty?!
Kitty Kenarban?

04:37.668 --> 04:39.975
How long have you
been out there?

04:40.062 --> 04:41.411
Not long. All night.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.674
It looked like a lovely party.

04:43.761 --> 04:44.762
Hi, Hal.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.548
Hi, Kitty.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.767
I should just...

04:49.854 --> 04:51.856
um...

04:51.943 --> 04:53.249
Hmm.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.772
What are you doing here?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.297
Well, I've sort of been
stalking my family,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.864
trying to get the nerve
to talk to them.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.562
I want to come back.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.868
You want to come back?

05:03.955 --> 05:05.653
I know what I did was terrible.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.002
I don't know what
happened to me.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.395
I guess I'd spent
so much of my life

05:08.482 --> 05:10.048
being righteous
and uptight and good,

05:10.135 --> 05:11.659
that something in me
finally snapped

05:11.746 --> 05:12.834
and I had to be bad.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.009
The last two years
of my life

05:14.096 --> 05:15.097
have been
a nightmarish blur

05:15.184 --> 05:18.100
of booze binges
and hotel rooms.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.537
There were so many parties,
so many weird scenes.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.060
The childhood game
of musical chairs

05:22.147 --> 05:23.627
will never be the same for me.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.717
Neither will
Chutes and Ladders,

05:26.804 --> 05:28.850
Candyland, or Capture the Flag.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.722
You know what's really amazing?

05:31.809 --> 05:35.683
Now that I have done
literally everything...

05:36.727 --> 05:39.382
I'm finished. I'm done.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.731
You've done everything?

05:40.818 --> 05:43.299
And now I'm done.
Done for good.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.301
Wait, I don't get Candyland.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.476
I am so sorry

05:46.563 --> 05:47.738
for what I've done.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.871
I just want throw myself
at Abe's feet

05:49.958 --> 05:54.919
and beg his forgiveness,
but it just seems impossible.

05:55.006 --> 05:59.881
Could you find it in your hearts
to maybe talk to him for me?

05:59.968 --> 06:01.491
Oh, Kitty...

06:02.623 --> 06:04.581
There's not a chance
in the world

06:04.668 --> 06:06.888
I would ever do that for you.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.193
But, I...

06:08.280 --> 06:09.847
You abandoned your family.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.675
Do you have
any idea of the pain

06:11.762 --> 06:13.590
and humiliation
you inflicted

06:13.677 --> 06:17.246
on that dear, sweet man
and that poor, innocent boy?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.030
I know you and I
used to be friends,

06:19.117 --> 06:21.468
but what you've done
is so creepy and evil,

06:21.555 --> 06:23.513
it doesn't get fixed
with "I'm sorry."

06:23.600 --> 06:24.775
It just doesn't.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.606
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.912
[door opens noisily]

06:30.999 --> 06:32.653
Hey, where's the party?!

06:32.740 --> 06:35.090
Oh, hi, Kitty.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.659
Okay.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.617
We'll catch up later.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.063
FRANCIS:
Okay, Dewey...

06:52.150 --> 06:53.630
since you are now
officially old enough,

06:53.717 --> 06:55.023
today is the day

06:55.110 --> 06:56.894
we start your initiation
into full brotherhood.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.374
-Wow, really?
-Yep.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.289
Reese went through this,
Malcolm went through this

07:00.376 --> 07:01.595
and now it is your turn.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.553
-Neat. When do we start?
-Right now.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.076
Get out of bed
and lie down

07:05.163 --> 07:06.730
on the Floor of Brotherhood.

07:08.210 --> 07:12.170
And give me the Pillow
of Fraternity.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.129
[knocking on door]

07:14.216 --> 07:15.783
Hey, Abe.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.045
We need to talk.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.176
What's going on?

07:18.263 --> 07:19.177
ABE:
Give me a second.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.832
I'm just so... agitated.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.921
-What's the matter?
-Kitty came over last night.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.316
Oh, Abe. Would you like
some tea or something?

07:27.403 --> 07:29.405
No, thank you. But I would
like some clarification.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.625
-What?
-Did you actually call

07:31.712 --> 07:34.454
the woman I love
"creepy and evil"?

07:40.198 --> 07:42.026
Wait a minute.
You're mad at me?!

07:42.113 --> 07:43.332
What happened, Abe?

07:43.419 --> 07:44.768
Kitty and I talked
all night long.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.117
She told me about everything.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.164
Every horrifying detail
was covered,

07:49.251 --> 07:50.339
and by morning we decided

07:50.426 --> 07:52.036
to try and make
a go of it.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.342
Stevie's over the moon.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.735
The boy needs a mother...

07:54.822 --> 07:56.563
and Lord knows
I need a wife.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.694
Wow.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.391
So, in the future,
Lois,

07:59.479 --> 08:00.654
I'd appreciate a bit

08:00.741 --> 08:04.092
more support
and respect for my wife.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.702
You're mad at me?!

08:05.789 --> 08:07.312
You're going to pretend

08:07.399 --> 08:09.010
that the last two years
just didn't happen?

08:09.097 --> 08:10.620
No, but I don't see
the need for you

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
to bring it up when you're
not an affected party.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.232
REESE:
You guys have to see this.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.756
You know how
you thought

08:15.843 --> 08:17.192
I would never do anything
with my life?

08:17.279 --> 08:19.107
Well, prepare to be blown away!

08:20.108 --> 08:22.850
I'm going for the full body,
head to toe.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.634
One continuous skin.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.157
It'll be the greatest
thing ever.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.898
Reese, get that
off my chair

08:27.985 --> 08:29.465
and get out of here.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.293
We're discussing
something important.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.861
Fine. You're not getting one
dime off the film rights.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.908
Abe, how can you be mad at me?

08:37.995 --> 08:39.256
I've been
there for you,

08:39.344 --> 08:40.955
day after day,
month after month,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.000
through all the dinners and
the tearful phone conversations,

08:43.087 --> 08:44.741
the parent-teacher
conferences for Stevie.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.875
For God's sake, Abe,
I'm your friend.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.964
Then I wish you'd start
acting like one.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.183
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:52.270 --> 08:55.056
I have a wedding album I have
to tape back together.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.149
Receive the mystic waters

09:01.236 --> 09:03.717
that unite us
in fraternal bonds.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.110
[toilet flushing]

09:06.197 --> 09:09.113
For though we are divided by
maternal evil,

09:09.200 --> 09:10.637
so shall we be...

09:10.724 --> 09:14.118
[gasping] Okay, I felt
something down there.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.646
Okay, Dewey, eat up.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.386
You're going to need
your nourishment if you're

09:21.473 --> 09:22.910
gonna get through
these next three days.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.216
You took three days
off work to do this?

09:25.303 --> 09:27.871
Quit stalling and suck ants.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.094
STEVIE: Most...

09:33.181 --> 09:35.226
of all...

09:35.313 --> 09:36.793
I'd like...

09:36.880 --> 09:38.795
to thank...

09:40.188 --> 09:42.712
...my father.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.845
-[beep]
-Got it.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.673
[tape rewinding]

09:49.023 --> 09:50.372
STEVIE ON TAPE:
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:50.459 --> 09:52.113
friends and family,

09:52.200 --> 09:54.158
esteemed colleagues
of courtesy, you honor me.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.986
But I can't let
this occasion pass

09:56.073 --> 09:57.858
without remarking that
you all share in this award.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
Tonight helped me raise
the banner of cordiality

09:59.903 --> 10:02.427
and strike a blow for civility
as we kiss rudeness good-bye

10:02.514 --> 10:04.081
and wish it well,
and furth...

10:04.168 --> 10:05.430
Reese!

10:05.517 --> 10:07.432
We're working
on Stevie's speech.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.956
I'm at a critical juncture here.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.697
I've hit a mole,
and I'm trying to decide

10:10.784 --> 10:13.308
if I should work around it
or try to dig it out.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.483
The roots are pretty shallow.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.615
That's grotesque, Reese.

10:15.702 --> 10:16.920
You don't understand

10:17.007 --> 10:18.139
the important work
I'm doing here, Malcolm.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.706
I'm creating a whole new Reese.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.229
Shedding my old life.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.057
That's how snakes live forever.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.493
You're an idiot.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.582
I thought you boys
might like some chips

10:26.669 --> 10:28.062
and lemonade.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.454
No thanks.

10:29.541 --> 10:33.763
My creepy mom...
gave me juice.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.288
It's not right, Hal.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.550
It's just not right.
What business

10:38.638 --> 10:40.161
do they have
being angry at me?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.032
Kitty ruined their lives.
She tore them apart.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.687
She tortured them for two years,
and I'm the bad guy?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.907
I'm not the one
with an S.T.D. named after me.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.517
I'm not the one

10:48.604 --> 10:50.475
who smuggled Lord knows what
in Lord knows where

10:50.562 --> 10:52.042
across the Turkish border.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.174
[snoring noise]

10:53.261 --> 10:54.566
-Hal?
-What?

10:54.654 --> 10:55.916
You're absolutely right,
honey.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.004
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.396
Hal, you're really not helping.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.746
I'm sorry, Lois,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.051
but you sort of
brought this on yourself.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.313
I mean, you should
have known better

11:02.400 --> 11:03.663
than to say something bad
about the girl

11:03.750 --> 11:05.142
after a guy breaks up with her.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.057
They always wind up
getting back together.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.537
This isn't Biff and Buffie

11:08.624 --> 11:10.278
breaking up
before the high school dance!

11:10.365 --> 11:12.976
I just, I don't understand
how he could take her back.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.369
He's in love with her.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.023
And despite everything
that's happened,

11:16.110 --> 11:17.024
he's still
in love with her.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.547
I understand that.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.636
I would take you back
if it happened to us.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.899
Oh, you would not.
How can you say that?

11:22.986 --> 11:25.119
There's no life without you.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.036
Oh, shut up
and go to sleep.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.258
Aren't you a little old
for this?

11:34.345 --> 11:35.782
[ceremoniously]
Prepare to drink

11:35.869 --> 11:38.219
from the Chalice
of Brotherhood.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.829
Something smells horrible.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.352
Is that the drip pan?

11:41.439 --> 11:45.226
[ceremoniously]
You're not supposed to know.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.315
I'm not drinking from that.
It's disgusting.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.100
Yes, it is disgusting,
but it must be done.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.145
Oh, man...

11:52.929 --> 11:55.758
[gagging and coughing]

11:55.845 --> 11:57.891
Awesome, Dewey.
You did it!

11:57.978 --> 11:59.240
I'm done?

11:59.327 --> 12:00.589
You passed
with flying colors.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.504
You are now a full brother.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.898
And now I would like
to present to you...

12:04.985 --> 12:08.771
The Cookie of Brotherhood.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.556
-That's it?
-What do you mean?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.689
I ate all that crap
for a stupid cookie?

12:13.776 --> 12:15.343
It's a meaningful cookie.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.693
It's a symbol of something
really cool and special,

12:17.780 --> 12:19.086
you little ingrate!

12:19.173 --> 12:21.218
It's a symbol
of what an idiot I am!

12:21.305 --> 12:24.352
You know nothing of fraternity
and sacred rituals!

12:24.439 --> 12:25.745
Give me back my cookie.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.314
Well, I hit a little bump
in the road.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.142
I totally forgot
I wasn't sunburned

12:32.229 --> 12:33.491
underneath
my swimming suit.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.320
Are you wearing leg warmers?

12:36.407 --> 12:37.365
Anything worth doing

12:37.452 --> 12:38.583
is worth doing right.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.722
And save. I think
this is going to work.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.637
Why is...

12:48.724 --> 12:50.465
your mom...

12:50.552 --> 12:51.771
so mean?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.337
I guess when you find something

12:53.424 --> 12:54.338
you're really good at,
you just stick with it.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.687
I'm glad...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.515
you understand...

12:57.602 --> 12:59.126
about my mom.

13:00.562 --> 13:01.911
Why would you
ever think that?

13:01.998 --> 13:03.260
What?

13:03.347 --> 13:04.566
Stevie, I'm sure
whatever my mom said

13:04.653 --> 13:06.611
was way too harsh
and totally unjustified.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.396
But your mom
abandoned you guys.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.963
Don't you even
care about all the crap

13:10.050 --> 13:11.486
she put you
and your dad through?

13:11.573 --> 13:12.835
She shouldn't be able
to just say "I'm sorry"

13:12.922 --> 13:13.880
and get away with it.

13:13.967 --> 13:18.449
This... conversation...

13:18.536 --> 13:22.497
is... over!

13:24.455 --> 13:27.110
Right... now.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.459
Can anyone help me?

13:28.546 --> 13:29.939
I can't reach this.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.723
Get that thing
out of here!

13:31.811 --> 13:33.421
You're spending
all this time with Stevie,

13:33.508 --> 13:35.249
helping him with
his little wussy award,

13:35.336 --> 13:37.077
and you won't help someone
in your own family

13:37.164 --> 13:38.252
reach immortality?!

13:38.339 --> 13:39.688
-Move!
-MALCOLM: Stevie...

13:39.775 --> 13:42.082
Wait! Wait, guys!

13:42.169 --> 13:45.346
Okay. Okay.
I see how it is.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.914
You want my dream to die!

13:55.747 --> 13:57.010
I'm sorry you guys

13:57.097 --> 13:58.620
are gonna miss
Stevie's award.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.230
Make sure you keep
checking in on Dewey.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.449
What did the doctor say?

14:01.536 --> 14:02.972
It's weird.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.365
He said it's some kind
of intestinal thing

14:04.452 --> 14:06.019
that people
in Third World countries

14:06.106 --> 14:07.542
get from drinking
stagnant water.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.458
Huh. That is weird.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.025
You know you don't
have to go.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.244
Oh, Hal, Stevie's
a wonderful boy.

14:14.331 --> 14:15.767
I'm going to go
and support him.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.899
He doesn't
want you there.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.596
Well, that's too damn bad.

14:18.683 --> 14:19.684
I'm going to support him
whether he wants it or not.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.295
They think I'm the one

14:21.382 --> 14:22.513
with the problem,
and they are wrong.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.037
Hal, they are wrong.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.603
And I'm not gonna let
them get away with it.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.215
I just think it's gonna
a little uncomfortable.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.956
Oh, I guarantee it's gonna
be uncomfortable.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.959
And if you do anything to make
it any less uncomfortable,

14:33.046 --> 14:34.786
I will never forgive you.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.789
-♪ Pardon me ♪

14:37.877 --> 14:40.705

WOMAN:
Oh, thank you,

14:46.146 --> 14:49.584
Sir Please-A-Lot
and Jam Master. Thank You.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.413
Who says rap has to be rude?

14:52.500 --> 14:55.285
[applause]

14:55.372 --> 14:59.246
I wish I could thank
each and every one of you

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
for making this night possible,

15:01.335 --> 15:04.207
-but there isn't time.
-AUDIENCE: Aww...

15:04.294 --> 15:05.861
I'm kidding.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.472
Of course there is.

15:08.559 --> 15:12.694
Aaron Aaronson,
Barnet Aaronson,

15:12.781 --> 15:15.479
Barnet Aaronson, Jr....

15:15.566 --> 15:17.307
I can't believe you brought
that thing with you.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.222
It has a name, Malcolm.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.615
Even though
the mashed potatoes

15:20.702 --> 15:22.486
are not supposed
to come with the duck,

15:22.573 --> 15:24.184
cram them in there anyway,

15:24.271 --> 15:25.533
whether the duck
likes it or not.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.664
WAITER:
Ma'am?

15:26.751 --> 15:27.709
The beef.

15:27.796 --> 15:28.797
Even though it's the carrots

15:28.884 --> 15:30.103
that are the problem,

15:30.190 --> 15:31.931
I'd like to exclude
the broccoli.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.237
That may work
as a metaphor, ma'am,

15:34.324 --> 15:37.066
but you're really screwing up
your entrée.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.633
I'll just have
another margarita.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.026
Oh, and, and, and hurry.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.332
It's sort of an emergency.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.943
Need another roll
in there, Dewey?

15:44.030 --> 15:45.074
DEWEY:
Shut up!

15:45.161 --> 15:47.033
I'm really sorry.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.035
I got carried away.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.951
I just... I miss you guys.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.301
And let's face it, torture
and humiliation are

15:54.388 --> 15:56.956
the only ways we've ever known
to say we love each other.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.654
DEWEY: You know you're only
making yourself feel better.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.525
Okay, okay.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.614
I want to give you
something, Dewey.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.181
Something special.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.357
I've never even told Reese
or Malcolm about it.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.707
It's like the ultimate defense
against Mom and Dad.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.274
Totally bulletproof.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.581
I'm listening.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.235
In Mom and Dad's bedroom,

16:15.322 --> 16:16.714
on the nightstand
next to Mom's side

16:16.801 --> 16:18.064
is a big vanilla candle.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.370
-Have you seen it?
-Yeah.

16:20.457 --> 16:24.157
Mom and Dad like to use
that candle when they, um...

16:24.244 --> 16:26.333
lock their door
and do grown-up stuff.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.639
You mean sex.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.858
I'm afraid so.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.164
Now it's gotten to the point

16:31.251 --> 16:32.643
that every time
that candle's lit,

16:32.730 --> 16:34.167
all they can
think about is...

16:34.254 --> 16:36.647
going back to their room.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.388
I have never seen it miss.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.828
Wow. Thanks.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.569
We are now
Brothers of the Candle.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.702
Francis, you gotta stop that.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.097
[murmuring conversation]

16:52.576 --> 16:54.665
I'll have another margarita.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.712
Well, I'm learning
a lot tonight.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.062
I never dreamt there were so
many ways of saying thank you.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.499
I wish there were more ways
to say you're not welcome.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.022
Excuse me.

17:04.109 --> 17:05.328
HAL: You know what
I never have?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.938
A margarita.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.204
Oh! Ooh. Ah.

17:12.378 --> 17:14.642
Lois, please, this is
just too tense.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.123
I'm sorry,
I don't have amnesia.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.080
You're the only one who
has a problem with this.

17:19.167 --> 17:23.651
HAL: You are one polite
old bag, you know that, honey?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.087
Excuse me.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.133
HAL: Come here, oldie,
give us a hug.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.743
He's cut off.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.354
Hey, that's Kitty Kenarban
at your table, right?

17:31.441 --> 17:32.747
Yeah.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.706
So are both of you
into the same scene?

17:35.793 --> 17:37.969
You know, "snip, snip, reow"?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.058
I beg your pardon?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.668
Ah, nothing, nothing.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.062
Uh, listen, um...
could you give this to Kitty?

17:43.149 --> 17:45.020
We were both in the, uh,
choir together,

17:45.107 --> 17:48.893
and I thought she'd like to
join us for practice some time.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.331
I'd be happy to.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.550
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

17:53.637 --> 17:57.554
beloved PBS children's
TV icon Frank Walston.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.383
[applause]

18:00.470 --> 18:02.168
Before we bring out
our guest of honor,

18:02.255 --> 18:05.997
I'd like to say a few words
about courtesy.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.131
Now I know that good manners
sometimes seem like

18:09.218 --> 18:12.091
just a bunch of dumb old
rules our parents invented

18:12.178 --> 18:13.353
so they could scold us...

18:13.440 --> 18:14.658
HAL:
You got that right!

18:16.356 --> 18:19.359
But-but manners
are so much more.

18:19.446 --> 18:22.492
Only human beings
have a system

18:22.579 --> 18:25.365
that reminds us
to care about each other.

18:25.452 --> 18:28.672
It is how we live in grace.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.588
Manners are what allow us
to be kind to each other,

18:31.675 --> 18:33.373
to live with each other,

18:33.460 --> 18:38.639
but most importantly, they
are how we forgive each other.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.424
And in the end, they allow us

18:41.511 --> 18:44.819
to listen to the voices
of our better angels.

18:44.906 --> 18:48.127
Now, can I tell you my favorite
thing about manners?

18:48.214 --> 18:50.477
[Walston's voice trails off]

18:53.828 --> 18:55.743
Kitty, please forgive me.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.094
WALSTON:
Well, the best part

18:59.181 --> 19:00.574
is yet to come.

19:00.661 --> 19:04.099
So, let us give a warm
courtesy welcome

19:04.186 --> 19:05.883
to this year's Gallant,

19:05.970 --> 19:10.323
no Goofus he,
our own Stevie Kenarban.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.238
Whoo!

19:12.325 --> 19:15.197
[whistling]

19:15.284 --> 19:16.764
Whoo hoo!

19:19.245 --> 19:20.985
[mic feedback]

19:21.072 --> 19:22.813
Ladies and gentleman,
friends and family,

19:22.900 --> 19:25.903
esteemed colleagues of
courtesy, you honor me.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.818
But I can't let
this occasion pass

19:27.905 --> 19:32.606
without remarking that you
all blow, blow, blow, blow.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.478
It means so much and requires
so little to take a moment

19:35.565 --> 19:37.654
to kiss my butt.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.569
[audience gasping]

19:39.656 --> 19:41.615
In conclusion, I feel the
evening would be incomplete

19:41.702 --> 19:44.357
without telling the world
that I am actually a lady.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.229
Thank you.
Go... to... hell.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.883
HAL:
He can talk!

19:48.970 --> 19:50.972
He's cured!

19:51.059 --> 19:52.321
[vacuum running]

19:52.408 --> 19:54.541
Reese, your
punishment isn't over

19:54.628 --> 19:55.716
until that bathroom floor

19:55.803 --> 19:57.587
is so clean,
you could eat off of it,

19:57.674 --> 19:59.110
which is what you're gonna be
doing for the next two weeks.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.287
And get rid of that thing.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.810
It's disgusting!

20:02.897 --> 20:04.420
Disgusting?

20:04.507 --> 20:05.987
If Malcolm made another
him out of hair,

20:06.074 --> 20:08.859
you'd be throwing a parade
for him right now!

20:08.946 --> 20:10.121
Aaah, no!

20:10.209 --> 20:12.080
It just took it.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.388
[vacuum cleaner
creaking and straining]

20:15.475 --> 20:17.085
That could have been me.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.832
I need a few minutes
alone with the vacuum.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.366
You're supposed to sign this.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.719
"Disrupted class"?

20:42.806 --> 20:44.155
"Insulted the teacher"?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.723
Dewey, you are in so much...

20:46.810 --> 20:48.725
-[exhaling]
-...trouble!

20:48.812 --> 20:50.118
Okay, first off, we have to

20:50.205 --> 20:52.903
figure out a punish... uh...

20:54.078 --> 20:55.210
Punishment.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.298
That's right.
And it's gonna

20:56.385 --> 20:57.734
be really, really...
Mmm...

20:57.821 --> 20:59.214
-That's nice, honey.
-[clearing throat]

20:59.301 --> 21:02.261
You are going to...
uh, to...

21:03.871 --> 21:05.829
Uh, Dewey, we're gonna
talk about this later.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.266
That's right.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.658
Lois, there's something
in the bedroom

21:08.745 --> 21:11.008
-I have wanted to show you.
-Mm.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.573
