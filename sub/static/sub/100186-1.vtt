00:03.504 --> 00:06.005
[somber music playing]

01:58.152 --> 01:59.918
¶¶¶

02:05.693 --> 02:09.328
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the London Tombs.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.331
The night has finally arrived
after months of waiting

02:12.333 --> 02:14.533
and you won't believe what
we have in store for you,

02:14.535 --> 02:18.737
but more importantly,
those unlucky few, who will be
walking through those doors.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.874
Before our guests arrive,
let's take a quick look
at some of the horrors

02:21.876 --> 02:24.810
that lie within the London
Tomb's scare attraction.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.245
¶¶¶

02:29.817 --> 02:31.517
[music box tune]

02:31.519 --> 02:33.719
[screams and laughs]

02:39.627 --> 02:41.860
Oooh. Scary stuff, eh.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.364
This horror location will soon
be seen again on the big screens

02:45.366 --> 02:49.201
for the return of the up
and coming sequel to the
original <i> Tomb</i> 's movie.

02:49.203 --> 02:53.605
As you know tonight, our lead
actors along with some of
their brave celebrity guests,

02:53.607 --> 02:57.276
will soon descend
into the hidden catacombs
beneath our feet

02:57.278 --> 02:59.411
for an unimaginable
night of horror.

02:59.813 --> 03:03.982
Our ghouls are ready,
the ghosts are ready
and more terrifyingly,

03:03.984 --> 03:07.419
our celebrities are ready.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.855
So, there is only one question
left to ask, are you ready?
Because you better be.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.927
Well how did that happen?
And he's not coming out?

03:14.929 --> 03:17.813
[metallic object dropping]

03:17.814 --> 03:20.698
Be careful with that, it costs
more than your house! Who am I
kidding? You don't own a house.

03:20.701 --> 03:25.003
Listen, I'm going to say only
once: solutions, not problems.

03:26.273 --> 03:26.972
Go on.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.574
Better not be a problem.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.329
I'm not reading that.

03:34.330 --> 03:36.814
-May I ask why not?
-Because it's awful,
absolutely no understanding

03:36.817 --> 03:39.284
of my character's
motivation whatsoever.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.888
You're a TV presenter,
Harriet, and your
motivation is in the bank.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.691
Oh! I take personal
oence to that and I
refuse to acknowledge it.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.025
Well you sort of just did.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.433
I am a personality.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.868
I am a star.

03:56.870 --> 04:02.641
And I would like to think
after writing for me
for over three seasons

04:02.643 --> 04:07.946
that those typewriter
monkeys would understand
my character.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.917
This is a bit dierent
than filming a two-minute intro
to a midnight movie, darling.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.987
I don't see how, darling.

04:14.989 --> 04:19.057
This is a synergized
multimedia event.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.726
The movie gets publicity,
this place gets publicity,

04:21.728 --> 04:24.029
the channel gets a scary
new reality TV show,

04:24.031 --> 04:27.432
and you, you get a
primetime audience for once.

04:27.735 --> 04:32.671
Think about it, a weekly
syndicated survival horror
show, with you as the star.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.008
Like, Bear Grylls
without eating the wildlife.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.744
-Aim for the stars!
-And that's why my
character has to be right.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.447
Luckily for you,

04:42.916 --> 04:45.617
I understand my characters'
motivation perfectly.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.819
No improv, Harriet.

04:47.821 --> 04:48.920
[grunts]

04:51.458 --> 04:52.958
You're looking beautiful.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.594
Thank you. Champagne.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.697
[cheering]

04:59.700 --> 05:01.833
We're still here outside
the London Tombs.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.037
And some of the great
fans are hoping to get
what might be the last chance

05:05.039 --> 05:06.638
to see their celebrity favs.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.774
Let's have a word.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.909
Hi, what are you most hoping
to see our stars face tonight?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.010
Bill Piper, Bill Piper!

05:12.012 --> 05:14.079
You're excited, aren't you?

05:14.081 --> 05:17.316
-Yeah, Piper, Piper...
-Piper.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.550
Yeah, okay.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.087
As our countdown nears its end

05:22.088 --> 05:24.722
let's take the chance to
look at who's already
ventured inside to their fate.

05:25.693 --> 05:30.729
Daytime soap awards
star nominee and star
of The Tombs two, it's Gigi!

05:31.832 --> 05:38.737
You better know him from
his boy band crooning days and
star of the North Star, it's PJ!

05:38.739 --> 05:41.773
Our celebrity sidekick,
Tanya Merryman.

05:42.443 --> 05:48.980
Television and acting school
and main state of reality
television, it's Lyle Rourke.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.016
[audience] Lyle, Lyle!

05:51.652 --> 05:54.853
And last, but definitely not
least, your celebrity journalist

05:54.855 --> 05:58.457
and news reporter and
blogger, Doug Smart.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.858
Doug, Doug, Doug...

06:00.728 --> 06:02.728
[Dom] This place
is a fucking maze.

06:02.730 --> 06:06.465
[man] Yeah, they do it
on purpose mate, it's
to disorientate people.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.401
Builds the fear apparently.
It's the whole point of it.

06:09.403 --> 06:14.539
I don't understand why anyone
would let, out of work actors,
chase around the dark for fun.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.641
I mean, there's something
wrong with people.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.810
People like to be scared.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.712
It's a thrill.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.447
You're a mug.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.851
[Dom] <i> Anyway, I didn't</i>
<i> come here to be scared.</i>
<i> I came here to do a job.</i>

06:26.186 --> 06:28.120
[man] <i> Dom?</i>

06:28.121 --> 06:30.055
[voice] <i> Don't be scared,</i>
<i> don't be scared.</i>

06:30.624 --> 06:34.526
To be fair your job is bad, but
not as bad as these fucking two.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.529
-It's not even Halloween yet!
-[guy] All right, all right.

06:40.167 --> 06:40.999
Dickheads.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.734
I don't know.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.537
I think they're
kind of cute really.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.571
[chuckles]

06:46.573 --> 06:47.773
Give us a sip.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.111
-Ah, I've got
lipstick on it now.
-Give it back here.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.063
<i> You see?</i>

07:12.065 --> 07:13.432
<i> I told you.</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:16.001
There's something
wrong with people.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.904
[chuckles] I take it you
don't watch horror films.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.540
What happened to good
old-fashioned movies
for the whole family?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.775
Listen mate, you know what
you're missing, all right?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.678
The London Tombs, the
first one absolute classic.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.197
Stone cold classic.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.715
A bunch of tourists, they
get trapped in this place
overnight, and then-

07:31.718 --> 07:33.885
then they get hunted
down by a deranged killer.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.520
Picked o, one by one.

07:35.522 --> 07:37.956
Total, old-school slasher!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.459
Yeah, that sounds great.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.163
Oh, I suppose this is your lad.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.232
<i> The one that does all</i>
<i> the picking and slashing</i>
<i> and god knows what?</i>

07:47.234 --> 07:49.718
<i> Slashing, slashing,</i>
<i> god knows what.</i>

07:49.719 --> 07:52.203
No, I-- I actually don't
recognize that one.
Must be new for the sequel.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.106
Let's just wrap it up here, eh?
There is a pint somewhere
with my name on it.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.041
You head.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.721
[clears her throat]

08:11.124 --> 08:13.525
That had better
be a glitch, Gary.

08:13.527 --> 08:19.130
Oh, come on, Olivia, what do
you want from me? I'm dealing
with all the technical problems,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.666
what in an underground
scare attraction.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.069
It's hardly wired
for audio visual.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.704
So, no problem then.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.040
No problem, just peachy.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.876
[sighing]

08:32.880 --> 08:37.148
-Uh-oh! Star wrangling?
-Character issues.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.217
Problems with the
script apparently.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.520
She's going to improv
it. I just know it.

08:41.522 --> 08:46.658
What, the writing team
couldn't get the right
mixture of tits and clichés?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.193
We've created a monster.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.329
She's more of a-- a minor demon.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.001
I was hoping for
fashionably late.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.871
Well, time to start
clearing out the stragglers.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.273
Well, break a leg.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.807
Fix the cameras.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.576
Yes, ma'am.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.545
[sighing]

09:09.883 --> 09:11.716
-Dom.
-[radio interference]

09:13.053 --> 09:16.354
It's not even started yet and
I'm already getting shivers.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.925
As we're close to kick o
that can only mean one thing.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.294
It's time to introduce
our final guest.

09:22.296 --> 09:25.564
You best know her
as the star of the
original <i> Tomb</i> 's movie,

09:25.566 --> 09:28.233
ready to head back
underground one last time.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.968
It's Piper!

09:29.970 --> 09:34.372
Let's take a look back
at her time in the
original <i> Tombs</i> ' movie.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.932
[engine starting noises]

10:05.105 --> 10:06.738
[engine starting]

10:09.343 --> 10:11.477
Come here. Come here.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.612
-How are you feeling?
-Yeah, yeah.
I'm good thanks.

10:13.614 --> 10:17.382
I'm, you know, really excited
to be here with, with all
the greatest fans!

10:17.384 --> 10:19.150
Um, your fans.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.786
I guess so.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.421
-Nervous?
-Do you know, what I've got
to be honest, I am a little bit.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.024
[Gary] <i> Dom, pick up.</i>

10:32.199 --> 10:33.264
[Dom] Fuck.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.879
[Dom sighing]

10:51.318 --> 10:54.886
I am definitely getting workers
comp over that you, dopey prick.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.062
My scream queen lungs
are ready to go.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.198
-Okay, good. Get yourself
in and good luck.
-Thank you.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.201
Bye! Bye!

11:10.937 --> 11:13.038
Our fan favorite is in.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.306
Let's hope she can
survive the night.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.747
Okay, don't hold back all
right. This is going on TV.
I need to make an impact.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.416
-Don't worry, you're
going to look great.
-Right.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.785
-Just don't get it
in my eyes, okay?
-All right, all right.

11:27.487 --> 11:32.290
What are you two still
doing here? I called places
fifteen minutes ago.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.258
Get moving.

11:41.968 --> 11:45.170
Finally, a real star.
Well, another one.

11:45.172 --> 11:50.075
-Me?
-Modest too, such a rare
quality in horror royalty.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.443
Well, I wouldn't say that.

11:51.445 --> 11:56.448
I was so worried you
would flake and leave
me here with the B-list.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.052
You know, I've done all the
reality shows back home.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.856
Now days, seems like a
natural career progression.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.326
-Is this your first?
-Yes. It is.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.260
I thought so.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.296
You seem a little stressed out.

12:11.298 --> 12:15.834
-Oh, it's not that.
It's just uh...
-It is a little creepy.

12:16.436 --> 12:20.405
-But this is going to be
fun, don't you think?
-I guess so.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.409
Hell, I was surprised
they talked you
into doing this at all.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.045
-Contractual obligation.
-[laughing]

12:30.016 --> 12:32.600
Funny too, what a delight.

12:32.601 --> 12:35.185
You know, once we're done
here, we really have
to sit down and talk.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.356
I am working on a bunch of
projects that you would love.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.126
Sorry, you're needed.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.830
-Hi!
-Hey, there. I'm-- I'm PJ.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.065
I know who you are.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.566
What gave me away?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.538
I'd have preferred a table
read if I'm being honest.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.039
Me too.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.512
And there we have it, everyone's
in and the doors are locked.

13:00.514 --> 13:03.281
The night is getting dark
and the creeps are
coming out to play.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.317
Stay with us as we venture
down into the Tombs.

13:06.319 --> 13:10.255
But remember, get
comfortable, stay safe and
hold your loved ones tight

13:10.257 --> 13:14.058
because it's not only
things down in the Tombs
that go bump in the night.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.061
[man] And we're out!

13:17.497 --> 13:20.198
Look, I'm not being funny
but how many more
links have I got to do?

13:21.368 --> 13:25.503
So, you know, what-- what's
it like, uh, being back I mean?

13:25.505 --> 13:29.007
Um, it's a little bit strange
if I'm being honest.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.909
It's not really somewhere
I thought I'd be.

13:30.911 --> 13:35.013
Oh, come on.
The only last surviving
character from a hit movie.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.281
-Seems like a no brainer to me.
-Ha, ha!

13:36.283 --> 13:38.950
Look what the cat
dragged back in.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.352
-How's the scars?
-Fine, how's the jaw?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.821
Lucrative.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.256
I'm sorry I-- I
missed something.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.491
Must be jet-lagged.

13:46.493 --> 13:52.197
This sorry excuse, arsehole
of a journalist made
quite a name for himself,

13:52.199 --> 13:55.233
-exploiting my personal life.
-And I made a mint.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.953
So, I broke his jaw.

13:57.954 --> 14:00.038
-Is that true?
-Oh yeah, he's an arsehole!

14:00.040 --> 14:03.641
You know what, Piper? I'm
so glad that they didn't kick
the life out of you completely.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.443
Oh no, it's there.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.512
I reserve it for tabloid hacks.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.882
-Anyway, I thought
print was dead.
-Bit like your career, honey.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.150
Why don't you move
on away then, buddy?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.053
I'll be seeing you.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.655
Don't worry about him.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.258
Why don't we go
and get a drink later
after this, you know?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.627
Whose got time
for camera queens?

14:24.998 --> 14:25.630
Oh!

14:25.632 --> 14:29.901
The three stars
finally together.
Ah, this is so exciting!

14:29.903 --> 14:30.935
Okay.

14:30.937 --> 14:37.208
Piper! I am so thrilled
to be working with
a "legend" like you.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.944
Well, it's nice to meet you too.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.130
[voice] <i> Don't be scared.</i>

15:01.401 --> 15:03.668
-Dom?
<i> -</i> [voice] <i> Don't be scared.</i>

15:04.304 --> 15:05.169
<i> Dom?</i>

15:13.546 --> 15:14.579
Dom?

15:16.616 --> 15:17.582
Dom?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.985
Hello.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.392
Dom?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.164
Help me.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.034
Dom!

15:36.569 --> 15:37.435
Dom!

15:38.238 --> 15:39.370
Help me.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.286
[voice] <i> Don't be scared.</i>

15:57.724 --> 15:59.490
[screaming]

16:02.062 --> 16:04.362
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around, please.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.397
That's right, come on.

16:06.399 --> 16:10.635
Thank you everybody
for joining us here tonight,
we appreciate your time.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.370
We'll be kicking o shortly.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.441
Excuse me!

16:17.477 --> 16:19.143
Focus here for a second.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.678
Thank you.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.514
So, I just wanted to run
you through basics.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.650
I would hope your reps have
been through this already,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.685
but I never assume
when it comes to agents.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.154
Each of you have a wristband.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.461
Red is principle cast
and blue is special guests.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.231
At a point during the
proceedings you will be split
up and pit against each other

16:40.233 --> 16:42.500
in a basic challenge.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.768
During which the scare
professionals of the production
will pop up at random intervals

16:44.771 --> 16:47.038
and boom, give you a scare.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.706
Understood?

16:48.708 --> 16:52.343
Rhetorical question, put
your hand down please.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.712
Thank you, everybody.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.786
That went really well.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.757
What are you still
doing here? Fuck off!

17:10.497 --> 17:13.431
Anyway, you go easy on
them tonight, eh, Nicky boy?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.333
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.770
Look, I'll catch up with you
later for another cheeky swig.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.238
See you later.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.347
That's new.

17:29.349 --> 17:34.819
When you are ready, boys
and girls, it's time to get
this ghost train on the rails.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.522
Harriet, on your mark, please.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.291
[beeping]

17:40.293 --> 17:46.097
Dom, Wayne if you're still
down there it's time to get your
shit together and head on out.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.237
[man] <i> Scare team</i>
<i> ready to go live.</i>

17:55.475 --> 17:59.177
And we're back
in five, four, three.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.778
[cheering]

18:00.780 --> 18:05.817
Welcome back to our long
night of the horrors, live here
from The London Tombs.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.820
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're ready to begin.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.556
-Are you okay?
-Just nerves.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.558
You don't strike me
as a nervous person.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.194
Don't worry, I'll--
I'll keep you safe.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.563
-Is that so?
-Oh yeah, I'm not
afraid of anything.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.199
Excuse me!

18:21.901 --> 18:26.337
Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, our spooky six.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.808
Wait, wait, wait, um.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.111
I didn't think you we're
afraid of anything.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.846
I was just waiting for you.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.115
What's the worst
that can happen?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.450
-What?
-Nothing, something
my agent said.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.152
Oh god.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.222
Eh?

18:44.858 --> 18:45.756
Ah!

18:47.494 --> 18:50.194
-What's your point?
-Piper, my dear.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.497
The London Tombs.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.799
It's the scene of
your greatest triumph.
Your, your brightest day.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.135
-Your...
-I'm not going.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.903
Why not? You've already
signed up for the sequel.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.538
This is early publicity.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.140
I'm not ready for
this kind of event.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.575
It's a closed set, there
is nothing to worry about.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.145
Seb, you're meant
to be on my side.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.679
What if that crazy
fan comes back?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.815
Darling, I understand.
Really, I do.

19:10.817 --> 19:15.553
But that was a long time ago,
and the sooner you're working,
the easier it's going to get.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.556
-Do you think I'm not trying?
-No sweetie, I think
you're very trying.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.827
Just kidding.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.462
Please, stop pushing
me to places that
I'm not ready to go to.

19:25.465 --> 19:30.535
Unfortunately, uh, it's not
me doing the pushing, dear.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.970
Contractual obligations.

19:32.972 --> 19:37.175
Forcing people into
compromising situations
since the 1920's.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.944
-So they can sue me?
-They can fire you.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.981
Think about it.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.216
Your future, your independence,
your bank balance.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.484
You mean yours.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.654
A man can't live on
good intentions alone.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.456
You've never had a
good intention in your life.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.594
If the sequel does
as well as the first, it's
seriously good money.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.964
I suppose I better get
my walking boots on then.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.299
That's my girl.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.935
At least I will have
you with me.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.203
Oh! I have this ghastly event
with another client across town.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.507
She's actually calling,
uh, a pretty young girl, uh,

20:09.509 --> 20:11.409
-dumb as
a skunk, you know. No.
-Are you being serious?

20:11.844 --> 20:14.512
Press love her, I mean.
At the moment at least.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.881
Un-bloody-believable.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.749
Seriously, you're
going to love it.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.418
You're going to--
Thank you, love you.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.987
That's right, you are
about to be a star.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.256
Yeah.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.524
Oh, I-- we're going
to have a blast.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.536
-Oh hi, I'm-- I'm PJ.
-Hi! I'm Tanya.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.772
Oh! I've heard
you're a physic.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.543
Wow! Talking to
people's dead relatives.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.647
Do you know how much
of people's life savings
they spend on that horseshit?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.617
I've never charged
a penny to anyone.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.884
Why don't you read my palm?

20:54.988 --> 20:56.387
I don't read palms.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.388
How convenient.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.624
-Everyone in their place?
-Yep.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.262
Uh, why can't I see
any of the scare guys?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.464
That's because
they're all hidden.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.598
That's the point.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.401
Sticking to the shadows.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.902
Whoa!

21:21.281 --> 21:23.781
Come on people,
let a pro lead the way.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.793
[door closing]

21:37.397 --> 21:38.896
[light metallic noises]

21:49.642 --> 21:51.742
I don't think so, pervert.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.945
I bid you welcome.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.548
Oh my god.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.716
That's not funny.

22:00.787 --> 22:04.822
The year was 1665.

22:04.824 --> 22:09.393
Carried on the back of vermin,
fleas spread the devastating

22:09.395 --> 22:12.663
plague through
crowded city streets.

22:12.665 --> 22:18.135
Struck down by this
aiction in numbers vast
enough to defy belief

22:18.137 --> 22:23.808
were dragged from
their homes and dumped
into mass graves.

22:23.810 --> 22:28.079
[screaming and baby
crying in background]

22:28.080 --> 22:32.349
Over three hundred years
later, while excavating the
very place of London Bridge,

22:32.352 --> 22:35.720
-the builders happened
upon a gruesome discovery.
-[background man screaming]

22:35.722 --> 22:40.558
Hundreds of human skeletons
twisting out of the earth,

22:40.560 --> 22:44.695
as if trying to make good their
escape from their earthly tomb.

22:45.064 --> 22:49.767
Some refused to go to work,
fearing sickness, while others

22:49.769 --> 22:52.069
were afraid of the
less physical threat.

22:52.071 --> 22:57.007
From the damned that
they shook loose from
their god forsaken bonds.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.644
When we were finally ready
to open on the tombs to
the public, we had a priest,

23:00.646 --> 23:04.882
concentrate the grounds
to, you know, contain
the restless spirits.

23:04.884 --> 23:10.588
Although and I don't
mean to alarm you, I
was oered no guarantee,

23:10.590 --> 23:14.392
<i> no definite confirmation</i>
<i> that some small...</i>

23:14.394 --> 23:17.094
Oh look, she's using the script.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.497
<i> ...festering for</i>
<i> a century still...</i>

23:19.499 --> 23:23.467
The only fucker that
festers here, love, are
the sub-par electronics.

23:26.806 --> 23:31.776
Two teams will enter the pit of
despair with one simple goal.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.913
Concealed into the tomb
below is a skull, one of many.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.750
Now, this skull however, does
not belong to a simple victim.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.453
Rather a man of great evil.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.656
A necromancer who cast
his curse on this place.

23:45.658 --> 23:51.028
The place of his interment
promising to return
and wreck his revenge.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.530
Robert White.

23:55.701 --> 23:56.884
-Who?
-Ah!

23:56.885 --> 23:58.068
That will be revealed
in good time.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.805
But for now,
I shall tell you this.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.175
I wish you to find it for me.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.910
It's getting like a game show.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.046
-Yay!
-To the victors, freedom.

24:09.048 --> 24:12.850
To the losers, well,
that would be telling.

24:14.654 --> 24:18.022
A Virgil to your Dante
on your decent to hell.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.691
Now, hurry along.

24:20.693 --> 24:27.064
Time is of the essence and
your fate hangs in the balance.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.870
[background eerie laughter]

24:35.575 --> 24:37.107
[distant chatter]

24:57.063 --> 24:57.962
Fire hazard.

25:10.743 --> 25:14.845
That's going to end up
somewhere very unpleasant if
you don't get it out of my face.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.080
[Doug] <i> Ooh! Is that a promise?</i>

25:19.919 --> 25:20.851
<i> That's better.</i>

25:23.956 --> 25:27.224
So, doesn't London Bridge
like go up in the middle
or something?

25:27.226 --> 25:28.592
That's Tower Bridge, hon.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.060
Oh my god, just like the song.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.300
[alarm going off]

25:38.704 --> 25:41.338
[chain noises]

25:47.346 --> 25:49.013
[eerie whispering]

25:54.620 --> 25:56.287
[chain and metallic noises]

26:14.840 --> 26:18.075
[distorted child voice] <i> Daddy,</i>
<i> what you doing to mummy?</i>

26:29.789 --> 26:31.956
Every motherfucking time.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.291
-As our celebrities...
-[cameraman] We're out!

26:35.328 --> 26:37.127
-What?
-Yeah, we're out.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.397
-What the fuck?
-They're saying all
the cameras are out.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.333
-What all of them?
-That's what I'm getting.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.867
They're re-running
the video packages.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.104
Great, so much for
live TV experience.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.140
I'm trying to get
something out of the
control room, just sit tight.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.697
These are real bones.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.200
You know you'd get
more screen time if you
kept up with the crowd.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.636
Besides, I don't want
to get left behind.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.405
God only knows what
these weirdos do when
the cameras are o.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.900
Oh, my god!

27:32.901 --> 27:34.985
They don't know
what they've done.
This is a huge mistake.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.321
[Lyle] Are you okay?

27:40.426 --> 27:41.959
No, I'm fine.

27:41.961 --> 27:45.663
Then let's go.
I didn't pay for the Hilton
to not be sleeping there.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.842
She ain't a physic, you know.

27:58.844 --> 28:03.113
Her crew feeds her
information through an
earpiece, she does all this...

28:04.850 --> 28:06.116
It's all a total put on.

28:07.953 --> 28:11.355
And Gigi, I can tell you
a thing or two about Gigi.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.158
Well, let's just say
she didn't get to where
she is purely on talent.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.994
And just don't get in the way
and her and the spotlight,
if you know what I mean.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.762
Total Tanya Harding type.

28:19.932 --> 28:20.764
Anything?

28:21.467 --> 28:23.333
[cameraman] Total radio silence.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.871
Well, I hope the fans
are enjoying their
extended their ad break.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.415
[Lyle whispering] So, I've
done many reality shows.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.351
This is your first one, so if
I can help you in anyway?

28:46.292 --> 28:49.126
-Having fun?
-You know, I think
you're so brave.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.195
For coming back I mean.

28:51.196 --> 28:53.263
-Oh, whatever you've read I...
-I was talking about the movie.

28:53.933 --> 28:57.101
-Oh!
-I think it's so brave of you
to try to re-launch your career,

28:57.103 --> 28:59.536
in a movie where they're
killing you o so early.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.073
Oh, you didn't know.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.142
I am so sorry.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.544
I guess I just have a better
relationship with the
producers than you.

29:08.881 --> 29:11.281
They're making me the
new face of the franchise.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.283
They're calling it
"The new generation."

29:14.253 --> 29:15.986
Have you even read the script?

29:17.957 --> 29:19.123
Okay.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.832
[baby crying]

29:30.503 --> 29:33.437
[distorted music box playing]

29:53.225 --> 29:54.458
[distorted voice] <i> Tanya.</i>

30:18.217 --> 30:19.416
[baby crying]

30:33.065 --> 30:34.998
Pathetic.

30:46.579 --> 30:49.446
<i> Current mood, unimpressed.</i>

30:49.915 --> 30:53.116
-Remind me why we
invited him again?
-Synergy.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.120
You see you keep saying
that, but I'm not sure
you know what it means.

30:57.456 --> 31:02.559
I'm already really famous in
LA. I have like over a million
followers on social media.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.662
And I really love my fans,
you know, they're so sweet.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.931
They're always...

31:07.933 --> 31:10.000
Oh Lyle, I just wanted
to ask you, um...

31:11.670 --> 31:13.904
You're not scared
already, are you?

31:16.108 --> 31:19.276
Something really weird
is happening here.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.911
I can feel it.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.180
Listen, I'm a believer.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.883
You can always talk
to me if you need to.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.586
Thank you.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.555
[laughing]

31:59.084 --> 32:01.985
Are you ready?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.220
Mm-hmm.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.272
Good.

32:05.273 --> 32:06.923
Cos we only have
one shot at this

32:06.926 --> 32:10.460
and there is already
some other idiot walking
around back there.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.598
-Do you want me to go
and have a word or...
-No.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.402
I want you to stay on your mark.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.438
I will find him later.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.708
[distorted music]

32:35.054 --> 32:36.286
[whistling]

32:51.203 --> 32:52.269
You okay?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.208
Just uh, bad energy here.

32:59.111 --> 33:02.579
Oh, quit it with your
physic play acting, love.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.316
Ooh, shit, fuck!

33:18.530 --> 33:19.763
Pricks.

33:25.738 --> 33:26.703
[honking]

33:38.117 --> 33:39.216
[honking]

33:46.692 --> 33:50.193
They're definitely life-like,
I'll give them that.

34:00.305 --> 34:03.573
Ooh, it looks like this is
where we are going
our separate ways then.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.643
Sorry, if I upstage
you, but-- you know.

34:06.645 --> 34:09.179
Yeah, the new generation.

34:09.181 --> 34:12.248
Yeah, can we quit the
chitchat and keep moving?

34:12.251 --> 34:13.750
No, please wait.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.186
Hey, don't worry, Tanya.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.522
Nothing bad is going to
happen. It's just a show.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.322
Exactly, she's already
playing the part.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.125
No, listen to me.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.694
I know there is something
really wrong here.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.228
You're telling me sweetheart.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.434
-Like what?
-I don't know yet, but...

34:31.770 --> 34:34.771
Something, something is moving.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.473
Well, it's not us.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.578
Listen, I know you're scared,
but nothing's going to happen.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.364
It's just a game.

34:45.366 --> 34:46.482
Please, there's something
really wrong here.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.318
You must be careful.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.321
Okay, let's go.

35:04.570 --> 35:08.271
You're confident,
you're scary, you're fear.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.342
You're confident,
you're scary, you're fear.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.343
[metallic noise]

35:14.546 --> 35:15.745
Hello?

35:17.249 --> 35:18.348
Hello?

35:18.350 --> 35:23.320
Haven't you got anything
better to do than play
with yourself in the dark?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.257
So not funny.

35:29.495 --> 35:33.163
Ah, you dick! Get out of here
man, my bit's coming up.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.470
-Oh my god.
-[metallic sound]

35:39.471 --> 35:41.238
Who the hell is that? No one
should be down here yet.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.472
No.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.407
Not busting up the place either.

35:44.409 --> 35:45.842
Oi, whose pissing about?

35:45.844 --> 35:46.843
[thump]

35:47.779 --> 35:49.312
This isn't funny, guys.

35:57.256 --> 35:57.838
[girl] Nick?

35:57.839 --> 35:58.421
[cameraman] We're done.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.323
What? Really?

36:00.325 --> 36:03.960
Yeah, they got the CCTV
back, but they can't get
the outside feedback live.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.731
-Oh! What are they going to do?
-Do you really care?

36:10.769 --> 36:14.271
Nah. Good point.
Oi, someone get me a car.

36:14.273 --> 36:17.274
I've got places to be with
alcohol and some people.

36:20.846 --> 36:21.945
[Gary] Watch this.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.986
Well, you know what,
we've got the reaction.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.705
That's all that counts.

36:31.706 --> 36:33.423
Are you serious?
We didn't see anything.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.259
Hashtag, no filter. Ha, ha.

37:07.859 --> 37:08.792
[gasps]

37:10.495 --> 37:11.328
Help...

37:12.931 --> 37:13.663
me.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.425
Oh!

37:25.426 --> 37:27.376
If it's going to keep happening,
we need to get it fixed now.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.280
Well, if you can get the boys
on the radio, be my guest.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.748
They're not coming
back to me, are they?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.450
Well, you go then.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.552
-Excuse me?
-Go and fix it.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.887
I'm a little bit busy.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.358
Fine! I'll go.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.759
You'll need this.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.062
And don't forget to
use the pointy end.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.063
Prick.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.700
Looks like my ex-girlfriend.
[chuckles]

37:51.069 --> 37:54.037
-Where's-- where's Piper?
Woah! Woah!
-Run!

37:54.039 --> 37:56.556
Look, I'm supposed
to be the jittery one.

37:56.557 --> 37:59.074
-What's going on?
-This thing he's huge!
He's just killed someone.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.877
Oh, you can't be serious.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.979
This is a weak attempt
to upstage me.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.081
Go and have a look and
see if there's anything there.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.534
See? Nothing.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.704
It's just a part of the show.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.839
They're just trying
to play on your nerves.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.941
-It's okay.
-Yeah, well it worked.

38:33.912 --> 38:34.911
Okay.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.646
Let's go.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.548
Let's get this over
and done with.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.075
[Doug] <i> Come on then, Mystic Meg.</i>

39:05.077 --> 39:06.543
<i> What are you feeling now?</i>

39:07.379 --> 39:10.814
Same as before.
Something very powerful here.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.419
The necromancer, the one
that Harriet mentioned upstairs.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.356
I think it's more
than just a story.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.590
I think it's real.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.927
Gather around for
I have a tale to tell.

39:24.663 --> 39:25.929
And you're right.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.664
He was very real.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.866
I'm not acting.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.668
I...

39:31.670 --> 39:35.672
As the plague spread
through the slums of the city,

39:35.674 --> 39:38.908
no one was safe from the
insidious spread of death.

39:39.177 --> 39:44.114
Fearing for their safety, they
turned away from the doctors
that had done little to stop

39:44.116 --> 39:46.983
the flow of chaos.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.085
And looked for a
more arcane remedy.

39:49.788 --> 39:53.623
A wealthy group of citizens
trying to safe their own skin

39:53.625 --> 39:57.660
turned to a man
named Robert White.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.797
Tanya, how did you
know his name?

40:01.199 --> 40:04.601
Specializing

40:04.602 --> 40:08.004
in the dark arts, most
notably communication
with the spirit realm,

40:08.006 --> 40:14.778
White promised these people,
that he could call on this side
to save them and their families.

40:15.213 --> 40:20.750
Although this came at a
price, Robert White was a
deceitful and wicked man.

40:20.752 --> 40:26.689
And before long his
benefactors came to see
their wives and children,

40:26.691 --> 40:30.827
grow sick and die
from the very illness he
promised to keep at bay.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.595
What happened next?

40:32.597 --> 40:33.830
[clock chiming]

40:33.832 --> 40:37.934
Oh, is that the time? You'd
better get on your way.

40:39.037 --> 40:42.806
No please I'm not
playing, I need to know!

40:42.808 --> 40:43.907
Well, what do you know!

40:43.909 --> 40:47.877
Someone who claims
they can speak to the dead
is actually talking shit.

40:47.879 --> 40:51.214
No please, I think
we are in danger here.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.890
[distorted voice] <i> Robert White.</i>

41:01.860 --> 41:03.193
<i> White.</i>

41:05.497 --> 41:07.464
Dial it back a bit, will you?

41:08.733 --> 41:09.599
Jesus.

41:09.601 --> 41:14.471
Stupid fucking physic,
doesn't she know who I am?

41:14.906 --> 41:17.574
Stepping all over my lines,
I'm going to call her agent.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.142
I'm going to get
her fucking fired.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.910
Let's see what
she thinks about that.

41:23.915 --> 41:28.151
You, you're in the wrong
place, you're supposed
to be over there.

41:28.153 --> 41:32.956
Can't you do anything
right? You have one job
and it's fucking easy.

41:32.958 --> 41:36.893
How come none of you
know what the fuck to do?
You're a moving mannequin.

41:36.895 --> 41:41.164
All you have to do
is be here when the
action's supposed to start.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.099
It's not fucking dicult.

41:43.101 --> 41:46.769
Why aren't you listening to me?
Don't you know who I am?

41:46.771 --> 41:51.241
What don't you
fucking understand?
Get your ass over there.

41:54.946 --> 41:55.778
[Greg] Oh what?

42:05.323 --> 42:07.790
[distant bell chiming]

42:18.537 --> 42:19.235
Hey.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.704
We'll be done soon.

42:21.706 --> 42:25.909
Get ourselves a sti drink,
somewhere with lots of lights.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.745
-What do you say?
-Yeah, sure.

42:29.814 --> 42:34.183
I mean, it just looked so real.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.019
Well, what kind of real?

42:41.693 --> 42:44.827
Oh my god! What happened?

42:44.829 --> 42:47.797
Take it the news didn't, uh,
quit travel across the pond.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.001
I had a run in with a fan
and he figured himself
to be my boyfriend.

42:52.003 --> 42:57.640
And when I didn't feel the same
way he got a little aggressive.

42:58.276 --> 43:01.511
Shit, I'm sorry.

43:01.512 --> 43:04.747
Don't be, I've spent enough
time feeling sorry for
myself and hiding away.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.250
This is my big return.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.954
Seems like a bit
of an odd choice.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.989
Yeah, I'm starting
to think that myself.

43:12.991 --> 43:19.262
Although, not as odd as
a claustrophobic entering
an underground tomb.

43:20.932 --> 43:21.965
You're what?

43:21.966 --> 43:22.999
Sounds like the start
of a bad joke, huh?

43:23.001 --> 43:28.304
-I thought you said
nothing scared you?
-Well not nothing.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.940
Why would they leave
a script lying around?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.942
Perhaps they missed their cue.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.611
Or it's a clue.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.279
Oh no wait, nope, never
mind it's not for us.

43:38.016 --> 43:40.350
-So, what do we do?
-Stay here, I guess.

43:40.352 --> 43:42.352
Fuck that!
We should get going.

43:42.354 --> 43:44.020
Don't want the other team
to find the skull before us.

43:44.422 --> 43:46.823
-Seriously.
-Winners get top billing.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.395
Okay.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.940
What, what's so scary
about this place?

44:06.945 --> 44:09.095
[Lyle] Maybe it's just me.

44:09.096 --> 44:11.246
Yeah, not exactly
the most exciting footage
I've ever filmed.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.315
Quiet.

44:13.652 --> 44:14.951
I'm getting something.

44:14.953 --> 44:17.020
Oh, come on give it up.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.122
You have to listen to me.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.890
No, I don't.

44:20.892 --> 44:24.727
There's something
supernatural at work here.

44:24.729 --> 44:29.832
The only thing that's at work
here is your ridiculous
overactive imagination.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.001
Something evil.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.169
From a misguided childhood.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.772
I know what I'm talking about!

44:35.774 --> 44:38.941
-You're not going to buy
into this shit, are you?
-Well, I don't know.

44:38.943 --> 44:41.177
She did know who
that Robert guy was.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.914
-How do you explain that?
-Mm-mmm, she read the script.

44:44.916 --> 44:47.083
Well, yeah.
I guess, that could be.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.251
Do you know what?
You two wait here.
I'm o to find the others.

44:49.254 --> 44:50.920
What the fuck!

44:50.922 --> 44:54.857
-Oh! Oh my god!
What happened to you?
-You need to help.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.693
Right, we need
to get out of here.

44:56.695 --> 44:58.227
Yeah, okay, fella. Good stu.

44:58.229 --> 45:00.329
He's going to come, he--
he will come for us all.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.031
Who? Who is coming?

45:02.033 --> 45:05.735
Oh, knock it o love, if you'll
excuse me, I'm leaving.

45:06.337 --> 45:07.904
I wouldn't if I were you.

45:07.906 --> 45:09.872
Yeah well, you're not me.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.274
See you later.

45:11.843 --> 45:13.242
Don't leave us!

45:22.821 --> 45:25.388
So, this is a hallway
of nightmares.

45:26.925 --> 45:28.357
[baby crying]

45:28.359 --> 45:30.827
Definitely, fucking
nightmares. Okay.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.096
Claustrophobia and dolls.

45:33.098 --> 45:34.764
I said almost nothing.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.805
[PJ] Almost nothing.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.245
Oh, shit.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.515
Oh, this isn't right.

45:54.185 --> 45:56.953
Where the fuck am I?

46:10.368 --> 46:12.902
-Ladies first.
-Oh, man up.

46:16.908 --> 46:17.940
You all right?

46:19.110 --> 46:20.877
Still can't believe you
signed up for this?

46:20.879 --> 46:24.013
-A job's a job, right?
-Mm-hmm.

46:25.250 --> 46:28.918
-You don't think they'd, let
me go around, do you?
-I wouldn't count on it.

46:32.257 --> 46:33.856
Oh, for f...

46:39.063 --> 46:40.530
What the...

46:46.104 --> 46:47.470
What the f...

46:55.880 --> 46:57.914
-I found it!
-Fuck!

47:02.187 --> 47:03.419
See, I found it!

47:06.191 --> 47:08.157
Ooh, interesting.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.525
[Piper] What does it say?

47:13.431 --> 47:18.401
"A warning to any
intrepid explorer who
finds this accursed skull."

47:20.138 --> 47:21.070
Ooh.

47:21.072 --> 47:28.110
"A curse will fall on those
that seek to remove it from
this, it's final resting place.

47:28.112 --> 47:32.248
Robert White will rise from
hell to seek his revenge.

47:32.617 --> 47:33.850
Go back.

47:34.452 --> 47:36.185
Go back from whence you came."

47:38.089 --> 47:38.921
[chuckles]

47:45.396 --> 47:46.662
Terrifying.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.098
It's plastic.

47:50.101 --> 47:50.933
Heads up!

47:53.037 --> 47:56.939
-So, does that mean
we can go now?
-Sure hope so.

48:08.119 --> 48:12.021
What the hell? I didn't
authorize that costume.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.667
It is fucking, fucking real!

48:24.669 --> 48:27.236
What the fuck you staring at?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.072
What happened,
what did you see?

48:29.073 --> 48:30.907
Fuck knows, but I'm not
hanging around to see it again.

48:34.178 --> 48:35.978
-Oh!
-Stupid bitch.

48:35.980 --> 48:38.314
-Are you all right?
-We've got to go, he's coming.

48:38.316 --> 48:41.517
-Who's coming?
-Him. He's huge.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.353
-What the hell is going on?
-Uh, there's a stairwell.

48:44.355 --> 48:47.023
Look, I've got
the skull, I've won.

48:47.025 --> 48:49.091
Just shut up, Gigi!

48:49.093 --> 48:51.994
-Will someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?
-Oh!

49:01.105 --> 49:02.939
Well, that was a bit much.

49:03.508 --> 49:04.974
Gigi, come on.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.326
Fuck!

49:23.962 --> 49:25.027
[Tanya] Help!

49:25.029 --> 49:26.462
Forget it. It's no good.

49:28.032 --> 49:31.600
-Help!
-Forget it. It's no good.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.803
Well what do you suggest?

49:33.804 --> 49:36.005
I suggest we head back,
walk into the entrance,
straight into the lobby.

49:36.007 --> 49:37.406
You want to listen
to this asshole?

49:38.609 --> 49:40.576
You're going to be
walking straight into him.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.329
Excuse me.

49:43.330 --> 49:46.081
But if this so-called gift of
yours has given you any
information whatsoever,

49:46.084 --> 49:48.217
then I suggest you might
want to share it with us.

49:48.219 --> 49:51.354
He's out there and
he is waiting for us.

49:51.356 --> 49:52.711
She's right.

49:52.712 --> 49:54.067
There is a fucking
maniac on the loose

49:54.068 --> 49:55.423
and you want to take advice
from an ex-mental patient?

49:55.426 --> 49:57.393
What do you mean
ex-mental patient?

49:57.395 --> 50:00.296
Ask her yourself,
a real fruitcake.

50:05.303 --> 50:07.470
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, right.

50:07.471 --> 50:09.638
If you look here, there's the
stairwell that's where she's
heading, that's our way out.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.741
Look, this is obviously
just part of the show.

50:11.743 --> 50:14.076
I mean, it's got to be a trick.
We've already found this.

50:16.748 --> 50:20.249
Okay, if you look there, there's
the stairway that connects
there and that's how we get out.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.217
Let's go.

50:21.652 --> 50:22.551
But...

50:30.128 --> 50:31.160
Holy shit!

50:32.263 --> 50:33.913
-Anything?
-Nothing.

50:33.914 --> 50:35.564
Right, we must have
gone the wrong way
because if you look here...

50:35.566 --> 50:37.066
[Gigi] This is ridiculous.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.234
[Piper] Excuse me?

50:38.236 --> 50:40.169
This is ridiculous.

50:40.171 --> 50:42.622
This is all just
part of the show,

50:42.623 --> 50:45.074
and I'm not going to let you
use this as an excuse
to steal my limelight.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.842
Unbelievable.

50:46.844 --> 50:49.278
-Thank you.
-That is not a compliment.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.180
Stop, stop it.
We need to work together.

50:51.182 --> 50:53.482
You know what I need
to do right now is show
those people out there

50:53.484 --> 50:56.102
what they really want to see.

50:56.103 --> 50:58.721
-People are dying!
-Oh my god, you are
as dumb as you look.

50:58.723 --> 51:02.124
You know what? If you two
want to go on, running on
home then go, but not...

51:02.126 --> 51:04.160
No, no, no! You stay here!

51:04.162 --> 51:07.430
Hell, with that! I'm going
to do what I do best.

51:07.432 --> 51:09.198
I'm going to be a star.

51:23.281 --> 51:26.415
Oh shit!

51:27.385 --> 51:28.517
Mother fucker.

51:30.388 --> 51:31.654
Run!

51:31.656 --> 51:32.488
No.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.156
I've got this. Get out.

51:39.864 --> 51:41.897
[Doug] Shit. Oh, shit.

51:48.206 --> 51:49.638
What the fuck am I doing?

52:39.590 --> 52:41.457
Unbelievable.

52:49.267 --> 52:50.633
Fucking brilliant.

53:10.621 --> 53:12.454
Fuck!

53:23.568 --> 53:24.500
[Piper] Move!

53:24.502 --> 53:25.367
[PJ] Hey, buddy.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.636
Yep, d-- don't mind me.

53:30.208 --> 53:31.507
[Piper] It's locked.

53:32.243 --> 53:34.227
Fuck.

53:34.228 --> 53:36.212
-Have you got
any cell reception?
-[Doug] Nothing.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.347
[Piper] I've got a
bar on my Wi-Fi.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.329
[cell phone ringing]

54:07.044 --> 54:08.310
Surely.

54:11.582 --> 54:12.815
Oh, shit.

54:13.718 --> 54:15.017
I think that's the Wi-Fi.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.353
Fuck!

54:21.259 --> 54:22.391
Thanks for that.

54:33.938 --> 54:34.803
Where's Lyle?

54:35.940 --> 54:37.006
He saved me.

54:38.809 --> 54:40.676
Which one is it?

54:41.812 --> 54:42.978
Oh, Christ!

54:44.515 --> 54:45.981
This is from the seventies.

54:45.983 --> 54:46.949
Jesus!

54:47.418 --> 54:48.584
Robert White.

54:49.053 --> 54:51.353
But that...
That was just a story.

54:51.355 --> 54:53.088
But one based in truth.

54:53.090 --> 54:55.024
Look, he cursed this place.

54:55.026 --> 54:58.527
He made a promise to rise
from the dead and rised he has.

54:58.529 --> 55:01.563
So, what? He's like a--
a zombie or something?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.966
No, a spirit.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.967
It's taken on a form
with no energy of its own.

55:06.871 --> 55:08.103
Nothing to resist it.

55:08.105 --> 55:10.739
This is horse shit.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.342
He was weak at first.

55:13.344 --> 55:16.111
But he is getting
stronger with every kill.

55:16.113 --> 55:18.580
Closer and closer
to what he really wants.

55:18.582 --> 55:21.750
-And what is it that
he really wants?
-A host.

55:22.486 --> 55:24.853
Human flesh and blood
to carry his spirit.

55:24.855 --> 55:25.854
And then?

55:25.856 --> 55:27.823
Then we can leave this place.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.893
-And God help us!
-[Piper] So, what
do we do now then?

55:30.895 --> 55:33.629
Well, we stay here, right?

55:33.631 --> 55:35.397
I thought you were
claustrophobic.

55:35.399 --> 55:37.800
Lesser of two evils.

55:37.802 --> 55:42.137
Yeah well, I-- I-- I for one
might be incapable of moving.

55:46.477 --> 55:47.976
What are you-- uh,
what are you doing?

55:50.047 --> 55:51.046
No.

55:54.919 --> 55:57.119
Hold it closed.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.054
Oh, fuck it.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.188
I give up.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.057
Fucking had enough of it.

56:42.533 --> 56:45.801
-Well, now what?
-We wait here obviously.

56:45.803 --> 56:46.969
Dumb arse.

56:47.638 --> 56:49.705
-Run?
-[Doug] This is ridiculous.

56:49.707 --> 56:52.574
-Are you fucking thick?
-You want to carry your own ass?

56:52.576 --> 56:56.645
-Ignore me I-- I-- I-- I'm in
considerable amount of pain.
-Shut up, man.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.514
No. He'll be back.
He knows we are here.

56:58.516 --> 57:01.049
He won't give up
that easily, he needs us.

57:01.051 --> 57:04.052
And where is he, if he
needs us so bloody badly?

57:06.524 --> 57:07.489
Where is Gigi?

57:11.061 --> 57:14.163
<i> Is this what you want?</i>
<i> Is this what you're after?</i>

57:16.000 --> 57:19.601
Shit, we-- we have to help
her. We have to find her.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.203
We can't fight him like that.

57:21.205 --> 57:24.606
-Then how?
-Something is holding
him to this place.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.909
Something that allows
his spirit to remain.

57:26.911 --> 57:29.611
Oh, brilliant yeah.
We're back to this
nonsense again.

57:30.147 --> 57:30.979
What is it?

57:32.049 --> 57:33.115
A skull.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.216
It's plastic.

57:34.218 --> 57:36.185
Not that one.

57:36.186 --> 57:38.153
The way we came in,
one of the skulls on the wall.

57:38.722 --> 57:42.825
I believe if we destroy
this skull, we destroy
the connection.

57:42.827 --> 57:45.561
Well fuck it, at least
it's the way out.

57:45.563 --> 57:47.229
You're going to
have to guide us.

57:50.534 --> 57:51.867
Oh, it's you.

57:52.503 --> 57:55.471
Look. You may have all the
others fooled, but not me.

57:55.473 --> 57:56.638
But don't worry.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.273
I'm willing to play along.

57:58.776 --> 57:59.942
Oh, my god mister.

57:59.944 --> 58:01.276
Please don't kill me.

58:01.278 --> 58:02.744
I'm too young to...

58:02.746 --> 58:03.545
Hey!

58:05.182 --> 58:06.281
Oh, not the axe.

58:06.283 --> 58:08.750
Oh god, anything but the axe.

58:16.060 --> 58:16.959
Oh my god.

58:20.731 --> 58:21.730
[screams]

58:24.702 --> 58:26.134
What's this?

58:28.772 --> 58:29.638
Nah.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.106
[Gigi screaming]

58:33.077 --> 58:35.177
Sounds like they are
having fun down there.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.045
Not for me.

58:37.047 --> 58:39.047
Ooh, this is the one for me.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.750
Ah, that's my baby.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.285
Come to daddy.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.120
You and me.

58:48.225 --> 58:50.158
[distorted music box playing]

58:51.595 --> 58:53.262
[baby crying]

59:25.062 --> 59:27.112
You're a bad ass.

59:27.113 --> 59:29.163
Yeah? I've been hurt before
and it ain't happening again.

59:29.934 --> 59:30.832
Fair enough.

59:36.707 --> 59:38.774
[PJ] Ah you're so heavy, ah.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.780
[Doug] <i> Ooh, what the fuck?</i>

59:47.084 --> 59:49.351
-Don't want to mess
up your pony tail.
-Shut the fuck up.

59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.829
Quickly, he's getting closer.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.236
Run.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:11.239
Woah!

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.178
-Piper!
-[screaming]

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.825
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:34.796
Fucking typical!

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.031
Come on.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.710
Here. Here, here.
Down, down, down.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.245
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:25.714
-Where you going?
-Going back for the others.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.566
No, no, no, no. Fuck them.

01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:29.417
We don't know them,
so we don't owe them.
Let's move on!

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.787
Look, just stay here
and be quiet. I'll be back.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:35.023
Woah, where you going?
Woah, woah, what you doing?
Woah, I've got money.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.058
Don't leave me!

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:37.292
Fuck!

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:42.831
Fuck.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.935
[noises]

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:06.254
[drill going on]

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:25.974
[drill turning off]

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.500
[screaming]

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:30.906
[general chatter]

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.878
[piano playing]

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:08.343
-[screaming]
-Oh my god.

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:13.415
-What happened to you?
-Long story.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:17.552
-A--a--a-- and him, that thing?
Behind me somewhere.
- I don't know. I, uh.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:19.521
What do you want to do?

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.123
We finish this.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.393
Okay, yeah.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.162
Yeah, uh, come on.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.208
But I was meant to be a star.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:14.109
[Gigi screaming]

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.149
Oh my god.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.750
Thanks for coming back
for me you, arsehole.

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:57.719
I could always just
leave you here, huh.

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.454
Listen, listen! We think
we've found a way out.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.023
Well, why are we
standing around here
talking like schoolgirls?

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.193
-I didn't have to
come back for you.
-Argue later.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.462
[distant scream]

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.463
Run.

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:33.021
Fuck you!

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.001
Piper!

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.253
You should've just
fucking left me there.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.390
Fucking pricks!

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:15.697
All right?

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.633
Do we need to rest?

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.104
No, no. Like you said,
no more hiding.

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:25.807
No more hiding.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.176
Now is not the time to panic.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:30.345
Now is the time to finish it.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.547
Let's go.

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:41.156
Give me a fucking break!

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:55.804
Please, please, please.
Of course it doesn't... Fuck!

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:06.381
Ah, for...

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.332
For fu...

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.212
What the fuck happened to you?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.350
Who the fuck is this?!

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.823
What the hell's your
problem, Lurch?

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:00.868
Which one is it?

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.238
It's got to be that one.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.781
-I'll go.
-No!

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.152
No!

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.791
Come and get me then!

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.270
PJ!

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:40.875
Robert White!

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:43.711
This tomb is yours!

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:50.185
PJ.

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:54.923
PJ.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.258
You okay?

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:00.361
Alive at least.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:02.597
Let's get you out of here.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:03.865
Okay.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.300
Come on.

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:06.668
Come here.

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:09.737
Come here.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:13.975
[horse neighing]

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.218
Ah, god.

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.303
Ah, put me down.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.920
Just here, just here
is fine. Put me down.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.497
Well, I guess that's
the movie scuppered.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.704
Still got the leading
lady though.

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:48.309
And the leading man.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.310
Well,

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:52.480
I'm not going to make
it to the end credits.

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:56.684
No.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.255
I'm done.

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:07.328
I um, guess you'll have to
have that drink on your own.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:15.003
My final girl.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.370
Woah, woah, woah,
woah! Help me.

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:23.871
Just wait, I've just got
to check this door!

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:28.943
I am still alive! As
unbelievable as it may seem.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:32.113
-[Doug] Help me!
-Wait!

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:36.517
The others?

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:43.024
That is one hell of an article.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.430
I need to get this door open,
because he's coming
and that won't hold him.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.833
I think he's already here.

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:10.151
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.455
Kill her, not me.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.090
Please!

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:18.159
I'm too smart to die.

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:21.028
Fuck!

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:25.700
[distorted voice]
Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.182
Come on then, you bastard!

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:57.198
Oh, fuck.

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:09.303
[thunder bolting]

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:35.897
[Doug] Woah, Piper.

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:40.167
[chuckling]

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:44.739
You are a fucking legend.

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:46.774
I take it all back.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.877
Ah, Jesus.

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:53.581
No hard feelings, eh.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.252
I got here to talk, so...

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.258
What are you doing?

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.127
I apologized.

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.163
I said I was-- Don't be stupid.

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:12.700
I sai-- I sai--
I said I was sorry.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.603
