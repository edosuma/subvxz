WEBVTT

00:07.564 --> 00:09.890
He's not an American naval officer?

00:09.984 --> 00:12.191
They said he was
a Royal Navy Commander.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.734
Which royal navy, Gerald?
There are several of them.

00:14.822 --> 00:16.364
I assume British, Doc.

00:16.449 --> 00:19.236
No, no, the Swedes,
the Norwegians, Aussies,

00:19.327 --> 00:23.325
Kiwis, Saudis,
they all have royal navies.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.988
The EMT only said
that the embassy told them

00:26.084 --> 00:28.372
to bring him to NCIS for autopsy.

00:28.586 --> 00:29.914
Now which embassy?

00:30.463 --> 00:31.743
Israeli.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.795
- Israeli?
- That's what they said.

00:35.134 --> 00:38.301
Why on earth would the Israeli Embassy
send us

00:38.388 --> 00:40.345
a foreign naval officer?

00:40.431 --> 00:42.803
Now, that's what I asked the EMTs
that delivered the body,

00:42.892 --> 00:44.351
but they didn't know either.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.246
Calls me down here
in the middle of the night,

00:46.270 --> 00:47.646
doesn't know which navy.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.221
Gerald, what does this look like?

00:52.151 --> 00:54.986
- One of my gloves.
- What's it doing in my drawer?

00:55.071 --> 00:57.906
I'm sorry, Doc.
I must've put your gloves in my drawer.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.197
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I'll do it.

01:00.284 --> 01:03.202
Gerald, unzip that body bag

01:03.287 --> 01:06.491
and find out
with which navy our guest sailed.

01:11.087 --> 01:14.171
Don't recognise the uniform?
I'm not surprised.

01:14.298 --> 01:18.213
The royal navies of the world
wear almost identical uniforms.

01:18.302 --> 01:20.129
In fact, during World War II,

01:20.221 --> 01:23.257
British naval officers
whose ships went down in the Channel,

01:23.349 --> 01:27.098
passed themselves off in Antwerp
as German submariners who...

01:28.729 --> 01:30.010
Good God.

02:13.541 --> 02:15.997
Shut off the lights.

02:19.589 --> 02:21.000
And return.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.468
Is the video camera on?

02:33.144 --> 02:36.928
- Sorry, Doc.
- It's all right, Gerald. I looked at it, too.

02:37.065 --> 02:40.932
How do you alert visitors
when conducting an infectious autopsy?

02:41.027 --> 02:44.361
We hang a decomposing body
in the corridor.

02:44.697 --> 02:47.188
A sense of humour under duress.

02:47.784 --> 02:50.191
That's an admirable quality, Doctor.

02:50.411 --> 02:52.784
However, when I ask a question,

02:53.123 --> 02:55.696
I want a truthful and immediate answer.

02:55.792 --> 02:59.042
So each time you lie,
or I suspect you lie,

02:59.295 --> 03:02.960
I will put
a nine-millimetre hollowpoint slug

03:03.133 --> 03:06.466
into one of your assistant's
ball-and-socket joints.

03:06.928 --> 03:10.511
- If you doubt me, I can demonstrate.
- No, that won't be necessary.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.177
May I make a request?

03:13.935 --> 03:15.809
You would rather I put the slug in you?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.387
- Yes.
- I can't oblige.

03:19.607 --> 03:22.525
How do you alert people
to infectious autopsies?

03:24.070 --> 03:28.898
- A lit red sign in the corridor.
- Gerald, the sign, please.

03:31.369 --> 03:34.987
Just a moment. Also, lock the doors,

03:35.331 --> 03:38.249
bring me a set of greens
and breathing gear.

03:39.210 --> 03:40.491
What is it you want?

03:40.795 --> 03:42.337
In due time,

03:42.922 --> 03:44.037
Doctor...

03:44.549 --> 03:45.580
Mallard.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.629
Like the famous English
A-four steam locomotive.

03:50.847 --> 03:53.764
Most people think of waterfowl.

03:54.392 --> 03:58.057
The Mallard ran from London
to Edinburgh for decades.

03:58.146 --> 04:00.767
In 1938, it attained

04:00.857 --> 04:03.692
a speed of over 200 kilometres an hour.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.850
- Two hundred and two.
- A world record.

04:07.197 --> 04:08.856
Although the Germans claimed

04:08.948 --> 04:11.071
it was set on a slight downgrade.

04:12.202 --> 04:13.482
Typical.

04:15.371 --> 04:18.740
You never had a nightmare?
Not even as a kid?

04:18.833 --> 04:19.863
Nope.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.044
No fear of the dark
or a bogeyman in my closet.

04:23.129 --> 04:26.498
Me, neither, but the vampire
on the canopy of my bed freaked me.

04:26.591 --> 04:27.754
You had a canopy bed?

04:27.842 --> 04:30.084
I was five. My mother was into Louis XV.

04:30.178 --> 04:31.423
It wasn't my call, Kate.

04:31.721 --> 04:33.879
- She still frighten you?
- My mother?

04:34.265 --> 04:36.935
- The vampire.
- What makes you think it was a she?

04:37.060 --> 04:38.340
Vampires are seducers.

04:38.436 --> 04:40.476
Knowing you, Tony, it had to be female.

04:40.563 --> 04:43.434
Well, she was after my blood,
not the pride of my childhood.

04:43.524 --> 04:44.900
You were proud at five?

04:47.278 --> 04:49.603
She finished the story, tucked me in,
blew out the candles.

04:49.697 --> 04:52.947
My mother thought that
candlelight enhanced the trompe I'oeil.

04:53.034 --> 04:55.110
Canopy beds, trompe I'oeil,
flickering candles.

04:55.203 --> 04:57.195
No wonder your bÍte noire
was a vampire.

04:57.288 --> 04:58.403
BÍte noire. Cute.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.325
Goes with the Louis XV bedroom.

05:00.416 --> 05:01.661
So, what would happen?

05:01.751 --> 05:03.293
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

05:03.378 --> 05:05.287
Oh, Tony's bÍte noire.

05:06.798 --> 05:09.004
- It's French for...
- Nightmare.

05:09.968 --> 05:13.752
- I do crossword puzzles, too, DiNozzo.
- Actually, my mother taught me

05:13.846 --> 05:14.967
"nightmare" in French was...

05:15.014 --> 05:16.674
Your father teach you how to report?

05:16.766 --> 05:20.182
Yeah. During cocktail hour,
while I was pouring his Macallan 18,

05:20.270 --> 05:21.812
three fingers, one ice cube.

05:21.896 --> 05:24.470
You know, I had to report in
about my day at school

05:24.565 --> 05:25.976
and just give him a sort of...

05:26.943 --> 05:28.863
We bagged and tagged everything
in Qassam's room.

05:28.945 --> 05:32.563
Wasn't much there.
Koran, prayer rug, fast-food wrappers.

05:32.657 --> 05:35.029
This guy took home from work,
didn't even empty his trash.

05:35.118 --> 05:36.826
He had sinus problems, bad breath.

05:36.911 --> 05:38.868
Yeah, probably because
he didn't brush his teeth.

05:38.955 --> 05:41.707
There was no brush or toothpaste
in his bathroom.

05:41.791 --> 05:44.496
Just aspirin, sinus spray
and breath freshener.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.708
- Did you swab for explosives?
- Yeah, top to bottom.

05:46.796 --> 05:49.085
Found minute traces of nitrate
in the dresser table.

05:49.173 --> 05:50.574
Probably where he kept his Beretta.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.673
- Computer?
- Not even a Game Boy, boss.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.334
- He didn't have a TV, Tony.
- Game Boy's handheld, Kate.

05:55.430 --> 05:58.265
You're thinking
about Xboxes, PS2s, Gamecubes...

05:58.349 --> 06:00.389
Well, I'm thinking of kicking some ass!

06:00.852 --> 06:03.853
Gitmo Intel said Qassam
was to execute a terrorist attack

06:03.938 --> 06:05.397
on the Naval Base at Norfolk.

06:05.481 --> 06:08.731
But he's in no shape to tell us
how or when.

06:10.778 --> 06:13.186
- His computer might.
- No computer.

06:14.532 --> 06:16.192
What about the food court
where he worked?

06:16.284 --> 06:20.116
Just keyboard with pictures.
Burgers, malts, fries.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.871
Not exactly cyberspace-friendly, boss.

06:21.956 --> 06:24.032
Hey, he could have used
an Internet cafe.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.999
I'll check Little Creek
in his neighbourhood.

06:28.046 --> 06:29.326
I should have thought of that.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.458
Well, you're more, you know,
smurf than alpha geek.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.918
So am I, according to Agent McGee.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.803
You're right, DiNozzo.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.261
- I am?
- Hell.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.971
I mean, I still use
a notebook and a pencil

06:43.227 --> 06:45.267
instead of a PDQ.

06:46.230 --> 06:48.104
It's a PDA.
You can call them PalmPilot...

06:48.191 --> 06:50.191
It doesn't matter what
I call it if I can't use it.

06:50.693 --> 06:51.891
I'll teach you.

06:53.321 --> 06:54.649
You'll teach me?

06:56.240 --> 06:58.945
McGee teaches you? You teach me?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.400
It's backwards!

07:02.372 --> 07:03.782
God, I need coffee.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.869
What was that all about?

07:07.377 --> 07:08.787
Gibbs' bÍte noire.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.258
Right ventricle, left atria.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.430
You haven't done an autopsy.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.809
It was late. I was due to autopsy today.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.137
Then you best place him on the table.

07:28.022 --> 07:30.644
- Did you draw blood last night?
- Yes.

07:31.025 --> 07:33.481
- Is it refrigerated here?
- No.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.776
You sent it with his clothing
to forensics?

07:36.030 --> 07:39.364
Yes. Are you a pathologist?

07:40.368 --> 07:41.482
Where's the lab?

07:41.702 --> 07:43.909
One floor up, directly above us.

07:44.038 --> 07:47.703
There's a stairwell
outside to the left you can use.

07:48.042 --> 07:49.287
Not the elevator?

07:50.002 --> 07:52.244
I assumed you'd think that too risky.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.373
Is it an emergency stairwell?

07:54.799 --> 07:57.206
No. That would be alarmed.

07:57.468 --> 07:58.666
Surveillance camera?

08:00.847 --> 08:01.926
Yes.

08:02.265 --> 08:07.140
- I answered promptly, and I haven't lied.
- You tried to trick me, Dr Mallard.

08:07.812 --> 08:09.390
That wasn't a condition.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.852
It is now.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.781
Ducky! You're in early.

08:23.703 --> 08:27.701
- Abby, turn down the babble!
- Babble? You love Android Lust.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.281
Not distorted by a speaker phone!

08:31.919 --> 08:33.995
Ducky, you're such a purist.

08:34.087 --> 08:35.203
What's up?

08:35.673 --> 08:38.756
I need the evidence
Gerald delivered last night.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.547
Oh, good luck.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.546
I haven't even had
my morning sprinkles yet.

08:42.638 --> 08:44.346
I didn't ask for the results.

08:45.099 --> 08:48.266
I need it all back, including the blood.

08:49.270 --> 08:50.664
What are you gonna do with the blood?

08:50.688 --> 08:52.597
Abby, just get it down here!

08:54.275 --> 08:57.062
Did you get up
on the wrong side of the autopsy table?

08:57.528 --> 08:58.809
Sorry...

08:59.197 --> 09:01.070
I have a theory to test.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.271
Wanna share?

09:02.366 --> 09:03.398
Not quite yet.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.492
Okay. Send Gerald up.

09:08.122 --> 09:09.497
He's busy.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.371
You'll have to bring it down here.

09:15.505 --> 09:17.497
Ducky, you know I can't do that.

09:17.632 --> 09:20.205
Abby, I don't have time
to deal with your necrophobia.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.052
I am not necrophobic.

09:22.178 --> 09:24.585
Dead bodies don't freak me out,
Autopsy does.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.756
Ducky, please don't ask me to do this.

09:26.849 --> 09:29.471
You won't have to enter Autopsy.
In fact, you can't.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.312
We've opened an infectious body.

09:32.647 --> 09:33.975
Leave it at the door.

09:34.065 --> 09:36.982
I can't even press the down button
on the elevator anymore.

09:37.068 --> 09:39.144
Get Gibbs to do it! Stat!

09:40.446 --> 09:41.988
Am I to believe that?

09:42.323 --> 09:45.822
Well, Abby, who is unfazed
by the most gruesome of forensics,

09:45.910 --> 09:47.155
recently had a nightmare.

09:47.245 --> 09:49.949
Since then,
she has not set foot in Autopsy.

09:50.039 --> 09:53.242
Gerald, is that true?

09:54.502 --> 09:56.744
She hasn't been down for quite a while.

10:03.386 --> 10:06.802
A code word could have triggered
that absurd conversation.

10:08.266 --> 10:11.350
Abby and I are not special agents,
we're forensic scientists.

10:11.435 --> 10:13.262
We do not use code words.

10:14.063 --> 10:17.397
Surely, you understand
the power of phobias.

10:20.278 --> 10:23.029
- Butterflies.
- Sorry?

10:24.407 --> 10:26.150
I fear butterflies.

10:26.242 --> 10:29.029
Good. Well,
not good that you have a phobia,

10:29.120 --> 10:30.578
but good that you understand

10:30.705 --> 10:33.741
that not a word I said was coded
to alert Abby.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.080
Who's Gibbs?

10:42.091 --> 10:46.753
Gibbs is the only other person
Abby has told of her phobia.

10:47.388 --> 10:50.424
He's also the one person
she'd turn to for help.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.720
- Is he a special agent?
- Yes, but does that matter?

10:53.811 --> 10:56.432
Look, all I'm trying to do
is to give you the evidence

10:56.522 --> 10:59.642
so you can do
what you came here to do and leave.

11:06.616 --> 11:07.695
Okay.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.622
Have you worked
with Dr Mallard long, Gerald?

12:01.837 --> 12:03.415
A bit over two years.

12:03.881 --> 12:06.835
- Quick on his feet?
- He was a miler at Eton.

12:07.134 --> 12:10.088
Still recalls all of his races
in great detail.

12:10.388 --> 12:13.342
Your sense of humour
seems to be contagious, Dr Mallard.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.259
I'm afraid Gerald took you literally.

12:15.351 --> 12:18.020
I have a way of going on
about my salad days.

12:18.229 --> 12:20.186
He associated "quick on my feet"

12:20.356 --> 12:23.440
with my stories
of the playing fields of Eton.

12:26.153 --> 12:28.395
You believe Wellington
actually said that?

12:28.781 --> 12:32.861
Probably not,
but most Etonians love to think he did.

12:34.578 --> 12:36.203
Are you lost, Gerald?

12:36.372 --> 12:39.955
"The battle of Waterloo was
won on the playing fields of Eton."

12:40.042 --> 12:41.371
Very good.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.829
Stick around the Doc long enough,
and you pick up a lot of trivia.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.710
Trivia?

12:47.049 --> 12:48.543
As much as I'd enjoy that,

12:48.884 --> 12:50.213
I have to decline.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.379
So you believe this...

12:53.597 --> 12:54.878
Abby, was it?

12:55.057 --> 12:56.433
Abby Sciuto.

12:56.892 --> 12:59.893
Abby Sciuto has really developed

13:00.771 --> 13:02.645
an autopsy phobia?

13:05.025 --> 13:06.401
Truthfully?

13:06.694 --> 13:08.900
I think your shoulder would prefer that.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.647
I never figured anyone
who slept in a coffin

13:12.742 --> 13:14.236
could have a phobia, but

13:14.326 --> 13:16.900
it's the kind of kinky thing
Abby would get.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.745
She slept in a coffin?

13:19.832 --> 13:21.207
She's goth.

13:28.007 --> 13:31.458
- Where's Gibbs?
- With the Director. You okay?

13:33.137 --> 13:35.129
- Where's Tony?
- The head.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.429
What's wrong, Abby?

13:42.104 --> 13:44.512
Ducky needs all this evidence
back in Autopsy.

13:44.732 --> 13:47.057
- Before you've tested it?
- Yeah.

13:47.943 --> 13:49.521
- That's strange.
- Yeah.

13:52.615 --> 13:54.109
I can't go down to Autopsy.

13:54.784 --> 13:57.987
- Why?
- I had this dream, like, a month ago,

13:58.662 --> 14:01.533
and ever since then,
Autopsy scares the hell out of me.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.414
- Why are you laughing?
- Sorry. Sorry.

14:05.503 --> 14:07.626
I was... I was just thinking of Tony.

14:08.672 --> 14:12.717
- Tony's afraid of Autopsy, too?
- No. Dreams of vampires.

14:13.135 --> 14:14.214
Oh.

14:15.179 --> 14:18.049
- I dig vampire dreams.
- Tony sure doesn't.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.927
- Well, that's silly.
- Oh, but fear of going into Autopsy,

14:21.018 --> 14:23.260
which you've done
your entire career, isn't?

14:23.813 --> 14:26.138
Of course it is,
but it doesn't change anything.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.520
I can't even take the elevator
to the basement anymore.

14:28.609 --> 14:29.807
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.439
So you want me
to take this evidence down to Ducky?

14:33.531 --> 14:35.073
- Would you?
- Yeah, of course.

14:36.659 --> 14:40.158
Okay, you have to sign
to maintain the chain of evidence.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.989
Right. Oh, and.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.073
Ducky's doing an infectious autopsy.

14:45.709 --> 14:46.907
On who, the terrorist?

14:47.002 --> 14:49.672
I don't know. He just said
leave everything outside the door.

14:50.464 --> 14:52.504
Well, Qassam's the only body
in Autopsy.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.299
Why would Ducky think
he was infectious

14:54.385 --> 14:56.009
if you hadn't done a blood test?

14:57.054 --> 14:58.133
I don't know.

15:06.689 --> 15:07.803
Autopsy.

15:08.065 --> 15:09.180
So what's going on?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.685
Yeah, I knew you could do it.

15:10.776 --> 15:11.807
What?

15:11.902 --> 15:14.524
- See you in 10 minutes, Abby.
- Wait. What are you...

15:17.658 --> 15:19.698
Why didn't you use the speaker phone?

15:19.994 --> 15:21.322
Oh, sorry.

15:22.079 --> 15:23.194
I didn't think.

15:24.081 --> 15:25.706
I always pick up my phone.

15:30.004 --> 15:31.747
I thought the safest way
to apprehend him

15:31.839 --> 15:34.460
was a routine trunk check
at the Little Creek gate.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.551
The security guard opening his
trunk had his weapon pulled.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.428
Qassam saw it in his side-view mirror,

15:39.513 --> 15:41.720
realised the check was
anything but routine and...

15:41.807 --> 15:43.785
He pulled his weapon,
and you had to take him down.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.600
Yes, sir. I gave him every chance...

15:45.686 --> 15:47.846
I'll read all about it in
your incident report, Jethro.

15:47.938 --> 15:49.207
What I'm interested in at the moment

15:49.231 --> 15:51.390
is how a terrorist got a job on the base.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.725
Fast-food workers are vetted
by their employers, sir.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.064
Unbelievable.

15:55.237 --> 15:56.339
What was he planning on doing,

15:56.363 --> 15:58.071
besides serving burgers and fries?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.114
I have no idea, sir.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.071
I was hoping to get some help
from Gitmo or Bahrain on that.

16:04.038 --> 16:06.077
Qassam's passport, student visa,

16:06.165 --> 16:08.490
and Social Security card
were all forged in Mexico.

16:08.584 --> 16:09.615
Same errors as papers

16:09.710 --> 16:11.187
on an Al-Qaida we caught at the border.

16:11.211 --> 16:12.587
Getting forged documents in Mexico

16:12.671 --> 16:14.082
doesn't make him Al-Qaida.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.746
I got the lead on Qassam
from an Al-Qaida detainee.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.291
Why don't you think
he's Al-Qaida, Agent Snyder?

16:19.428 --> 16:21.753
Yasir Qassam was born
in the Gaza strip.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.923
His parents were killed
during the second Intifada

16:24.016 --> 16:25.261
when their home was shelled.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.509
His brother Saleem
was recruited by Hamas

16:27.603 --> 16:29.311
as a shahid, a suicide bomber.

16:29.438 --> 16:32.273
This tape aired on Al-Jazeera
after Saleem blew himself up,

16:32.358 --> 16:33.935
along with nine Israeli civilians

16:34.026 --> 16:35.189
on a bus in Jerusalem.

16:35.277 --> 16:38.064
Now, Saleem is reciting
the usual martyr rhetoric,

16:38.155 --> 16:39.530
but he dedicates his death

16:39.615 --> 16:41.940
to avenge the blood
of his father and mother.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.572
I believe Yasir used his real name
on forged documents

16:44.662 --> 16:47.366
because he was
a Hamas shahida like his brother.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.352
Maybe he wanted to make sure
that he got the 70 virgins,

16:50.376 --> 16:52.499
instead of some Muslim
with an alias he used.

16:52.586 --> 16:54.330
Shahidas are like our sports stars

16:54.421 --> 16:55.797
to Palestinian kids.

16:55.923 --> 16:58.793
Qassam could've used his real
name to be famous in Gaza.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.924
Exactly. It doesn't make sense
that he would die

17:01.011 --> 17:02.636
on an Al-Qaida mission in the States.

17:02.721 --> 17:03.966
He'd want to kill Israelis.

17:04.056 --> 17:07.223
Hamas or Al-Qaida,
what was he trying to do?

17:07.309 --> 17:08.887
All I know is that Qassam was key

17:08.978 --> 17:11.054
to a planned suicide mission at Norfolk.

17:11.689 --> 17:12.888
I've nothing to add, Director.

17:12.982 --> 17:14.144
Think of something.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.144
- Well?
- Daniel Snyder's a good agent, sir.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.315
I'd trust his instincts.

17:18.444 --> 17:20.686
Hamas has never attacked
targets on U.S. Soil

17:20.781 --> 17:23.698
for fear of losing financial support
from pro-Arab Americans.

17:23.784 --> 17:25.064
How can you support any group

17:25.160 --> 17:27.367
that lets their children
blow themselves up?

17:27.454 --> 17:29.281
Their leaders say that
the suicide bombers

17:29.373 --> 17:30.653
are all they have to fight with.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.501
Sir, when Hamas leaders
start blowing themselves up,

17:33.585 --> 17:34.866
I'll consider it.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.790
There's a way to overcome this.

17:39.174 --> 17:40.585
Really? How?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.802
Group therapy.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.506
How many people have
a fear of autopsy?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.341
You're gonna be a group of one!

17:47.433 --> 17:50.303
Lots of people wouldn't be caught dead
in an autopsy room.

17:50.686 --> 17:53.521
Very funny. Maybe hypnotism.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.515
Remember Dr Wertzer's class?

17:55.607 --> 17:57.043
You still don't know
what he made you do

17:57.067 --> 17:58.169
when you were under hypnosis.

17:58.193 --> 18:00.566
Whatever it was,
I woke up feeling refreshed,

18:01.822 --> 18:02.937
in his office,

18:03.032 --> 18:04.739
- a day later.
- Abby?

18:05.075 --> 18:06.190
Yes?

18:06.535 --> 18:07.650
What are you doing?

18:09.371 --> 18:12.538
- I was having an internal debate.
- Who's winning?

18:12.750 --> 18:16.498
I'm not sure. Oh, hell, the phobic side.

18:16.587 --> 18:18.875
- Still can't enter Autopsy?
- No.

18:19.048 --> 18:22.132
Did you find any tag traces of explosives
on the terrorist's clothes?

18:22.217 --> 18:23.462
Ducky took everything back

18:23.552 --> 18:25.545
- before I had a chance to test it.
- What?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.262
Don't look at me. He wouldn't say why.

18:27.347 --> 18:29.388
He just wanted everything back,
including the blood.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.716
- Including the blood?
- Yeah, it's a bit weird.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.455
There's no way to do a blood test
in Autopsy.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.685
- Gerald pick it up?
- Gerald was busy.

18:35.773 --> 18:38.892
- Ducky just wanted me down there stat.
- Stat?

18:39.359 --> 18:42.230
Yeah, and I wouldn't go,
so Kate took it down.

18:43.572 --> 18:46.858
- Hey, boss. What's up, Abs?
- Something's...

18:46.950 --> 18:47.982
Hinky?

18:48.077 --> 18:49.736
- Tony, get Autopsy on the plasma.
- Huh?

18:49.828 --> 18:52.070
Autopsy. TV. Now!

18:52.164 --> 18:53.706
Why would Ducky say "stat"?

18:53.791 --> 18:56.364
Because he's a doctor,
and because "stat" means fast and...

18:56.460 --> 18:59.212
Medical emergency.
But what is a medical emergency

18:59.296 --> 19:00.494
in Autopsy?

19:01.924 --> 19:03.334
All I'm getting is snow.

19:22.486 --> 19:24.194
You can leave it there.

19:24.488 --> 19:25.768
You have to sign.

19:25.948 --> 19:29.482
Well, I can't open the doors
with you there.

19:29.576 --> 19:32.363
- What's the infection?
- Don't know yet.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.111
There's a pustule on his thigh.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.787
May be nothing.

19:40.254 --> 19:42.626
I'll sign, cross my heart.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.635
- I beat my phobia.
- Yes.

19:48.804 --> 19:50.464
So I see, Abby.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.515
Well done.

20:15.289 --> 20:18.574
When did lab rats start carrying
Sig Sauers?

20:23.121 --> 20:25.446
Punch up Autopsy Receiving
and stairwell cameras,

20:25.540 --> 20:26.916
then the building floor plans.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.281
On it, boss.

20:28.627 --> 20:31.960
Gibbs for Director.
Abby, Ducky sound funny?

20:32.464 --> 20:35.418
Kind of tense, like when a test result
isn't what he expected.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.637
Director, we may have intruders
in Autopsy.

20:39.888 --> 20:41.347
Possible hostage situation.

20:41.431 --> 20:43.839
We got an ambulance
outside Autopsy Receiving, boss.

20:43.934 --> 20:47.801
Yes, sir, I think we should alert HRT
and open a command centre in MTAC.

20:48.188 --> 20:51.355
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, God, I should be down there.

20:51.608 --> 20:54.016
- Tony, where's my floor plan?
- Coming up!

20:55.112 --> 20:58.563
Okay. Get me two agents in Receiving,
two in the elevator here.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.492
Go to TAC one. TAC one.

21:01.576 --> 21:04.826
- Abs, how do I rotate this thing?
- Just tell me what you need.

21:04.913 --> 21:08.329
Your lab and Autopsy.
All entrances and exits.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.666
Give me a 360. Keep going.

21:10.752 --> 21:13.504
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
Go, go, go. Stop. Right there.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.084
What's this, right here?

21:17.008 --> 21:18.835
- My gas chromatograph.
- Can it be moved?

21:18.927 --> 21:20.421
- Yeah.
- Do it.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.549
Hey, Abby, I need a drill
and a flexible video probe.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.671
Got it.

21:24.766 --> 21:26.828
Agents on their way.
We taking the basement stairwell?

21:26.852 --> 21:27.931
Yeah.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.653
No throwaway?

21:42.451 --> 21:46.318
"Special Agent Caitlin Todd."

21:52.878 --> 21:54.870
You any good with this gun, Caitlin?

21:54.963 --> 21:56.706
Give it back and I'll demonstrate.

21:58.425 --> 22:00.832
Ever fire it in anger?

22:01.344 --> 22:03.052
I would love to right now.

22:05.348 --> 22:06.926
Did you shoot Qassam?

22:11.062 --> 22:13.138
Did you put that double tap in his heart?

22:17.527 --> 22:19.354
She didn't shoot him.

22:20.947 --> 22:22.192
Who did?

22:27.454 --> 22:30.538
- Special Agent Gibbs.
- Ducky!

22:31.124 --> 22:33.698
That name rings a bell, Dr Mallard.

22:34.503 --> 22:36.294
Don't answer this bastard!

22:37.589 --> 22:40.210
You mustn't chastise
the good Doctor, Caitlin,

22:40.467 --> 22:43.302
at least not until you know my rules.

22:43.386 --> 22:45.213
I don't play by terrorist rules.

22:47.349 --> 22:49.057
Who says I'm a terrorist?

22:52.687 --> 22:56.352
Doctor, is this all the evidence?

22:56.858 --> 22:59.610
From what I can see from here. Gerald?

23:00.362 --> 23:01.737
It looks like all of it.

23:03.073 --> 23:06.192
Caitlin, you may roll over now,

23:06.535 --> 23:08.326
if you keep your hands where they are.

23:16.461 --> 23:19.248
Did special agents search
Qassam's room?

23:22.717 --> 23:26.382
Where is the evidence
that was bagged and tagged?

23:31.226 --> 23:35.140
Doctor, please explain the rules
to stubborn little Caitlin.

23:36.398 --> 23:39.067
If we lie, or he thinks we're lying,

23:39.150 --> 23:42.235
he'll put a bullet
in one of Gerald's joints.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.990
Be specific. Ball and socket joints.

23:45.073 --> 23:47.315
And you omitted one condition.

23:47.867 --> 23:50.275
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.656
Oh, yes!

23:53.915 --> 23:55.707
We mustn't try to trick him.

23:56.793 --> 24:00.162
Which you tried to do, Caitlin,
by saying you beat your phobia.

24:01.256 --> 24:04.707
- Well, she didn't know the rules.
- But you did, Dr Mallard,

24:05.468 --> 24:08.635
and you joined the ruse
by calling her Abby.

24:24.487 --> 24:26.527
Autopsy's dark.
Who'd you get to back us?

24:26.615 --> 24:28.856
Pacci's covering Receiving.
Balboa, the elevator.

24:28.950 --> 24:30.444
- Pacci?
- Gibbs.

24:30.535 --> 24:32.693
- You in place?
- Affirmative. Ambulance is empty.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.282
Elevator door closed.

24:34.456 --> 24:37.373
- You want us to enter?
- Negative. Hold your position. Balboa?

24:37.459 --> 24:39.498
Standing by.
Personnel elevator locked down.

24:39.586 --> 24:41.662
Disable the bell. Go down to Autopsy.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.130
Do not open the doors.

24:43.256 --> 24:45.000
- Roger.
- I'm going to MTAC.

24:45.091 --> 24:47.380
We got a hostage situation,
don't we, boss?

24:48.303 --> 24:50.758
- Time to make a phone call.
- Yeah.

24:53.975 --> 24:57.925
- Don't worry, son. I'll take care of you.
- You bastard!

24:58.021 --> 24:59.599
You seem like
such a bright young woman,

24:59.689 --> 25:00.769
and that's all you can say?

25:00.857 --> 25:02.055
You... bastard!

25:02.150 --> 25:05.436
Kate, Kate, Kate, my medical bag,
over by the desk, on the floor.

25:06.154 --> 25:08.775
It's all right, Gerald, hang on.
I've got morphine.

25:08.865 --> 25:12.614
I would dislike having to put a slug
into Gerald's knee as well.

25:17.707 --> 25:21.705
Gibbs, DiNozzo. Kate just ran past
the doors inside Autopsy.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.415
She just ran back again.

25:24.506 --> 25:26.000
I read you, Tony. Stand by.

25:27.342 --> 25:28.919
No video from Autopsy.

25:29.010 --> 25:31.169
It's looking like
a hostage situation, Director.

25:31.262 --> 25:33.469
Three of our people, Dr Mallard,
his assistant,

25:33.556 --> 25:35.798
Gerald Jackson,
Special Agent Kate Todd.

25:35.892 --> 25:37.600
Unknown number of dirt bags.

25:37.686 --> 25:40.889
- Let's find out. Start tape.
- Yes, sir.

25:48.071 --> 25:49.446
Answer the phone, Doctor.

25:49.531 --> 25:51.856
You answer it!
I'm trying to stop this bleeding.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.405
- Give him the morphine!
- Where?

25:54.494 --> 25:58.278
- In the thigh, right through the cloth.
- Yeah.

25:58.373 --> 26:01.623
You better answer that phone,
or you'll be working on his knee.

26:01.710 --> 26:04.331
Kate, come here, come here.
Throw that away. Come here, come on.

26:04.421 --> 26:05.500
Put pressure on here.

26:05.588 --> 26:07.961
If the blood seeps through your fingers,
then push harder.

26:10.844 --> 26:12.042
Autopsy.

26:12.137 --> 26:15.256
Ducky, what's with
the infectious autopsy?

26:16.182 --> 26:17.677
Purely precautionary.

26:18.059 --> 26:22.520
- That why you took the evidence back?
- Yes. Sorry. Look, I'm really busy.

26:24.107 --> 26:25.601
Is Kate there?

26:26.443 --> 26:28.768
No. She left a few minutes ago.

26:29.612 --> 26:30.857
Okay.

26:31.364 --> 26:32.591
You let me know
when I can come down.

26:32.615 --> 26:33.944
You got me curious.

26:36.286 --> 26:38.693
I can't wait to weigh your liver.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.285
Unknown male in Autopsy.

26:43.376 --> 26:45.618
Wearing greens.
Medium build and height.

26:45.712 --> 26:48.464
- Copy.
- The FBI hostage rescue team

26:48.548 --> 26:50.042
will be on site in seven minutes.

26:50.133 --> 26:51.627
We need an eye in Autopsy.

26:51.843 --> 26:52.874
On it.

26:57.557 --> 26:59.550
- How's he doing?
- I'm fine.

26:59.642 --> 27:01.552
The bleeding's stopped. That's good.

27:02.479 --> 27:03.854
Yes and no.

27:04.564 --> 27:06.142
Correct, Dr Mallard?

27:06.232 --> 27:09.933
I had to clamp his
auxiliary artery to stop it.

27:10.028 --> 27:13.646
Which means Gerald will lose his arm
if the artery isn't repaired

27:13.740 --> 27:15.614
and the blood flow restored soon.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.242
Ducky, can't you do that?

27:17.619 --> 27:20.240
This is an autopsy room, not an ER.

27:20.455 --> 27:22.079
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

27:22.165 --> 27:25.450
I mean, he's going to need
a fully-equipped room and staff.

27:25.543 --> 27:28.461
Which he will get
as soon as I'm out of here.

27:29.339 --> 27:32.755
So, where is the evidence collected
in Qassam's room?

27:35.970 --> 27:37.880
- The lock-up.
- Which is?

27:38.640 --> 27:40.881
In the garage, one floor up.

27:41.351 --> 27:44.352
- Same way I came in?
- I don't know how you came in.

27:44.437 --> 27:45.635
In a body bag.

27:46.022 --> 27:47.600
Same way you're going out.

27:48.024 --> 27:49.435
Is it the same garage?

27:49.526 --> 27:52.977
No. The evidence locker
is in the garage next to Forensics.

27:53.363 --> 27:54.643
Above us.

28:09.838 --> 28:12.957
Oh, God, Gerald.
Oh, I should be in there.

28:13.299 --> 28:14.675
Feed it into MTAC.

28:16.678 --> 28:21.090
Hey, maybe you're not there, Abby,
because you are needed here.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.012
Go.

28:27.856 --> 28:29.101
One intruder?

28:30.066 --> 28:32.438
- That's all I see, sir.
- Zoom in.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.199
Guess he knows we're onto him.

29:03.558 --> 29:05.965
Doctor, Caitlin.

29:07.729 --> 29:10.136
Put Qassam in the body bag.

29:17.071 --> 29:18.530
Now, please.

29:22.619 --> 29:25.074
Soon, they'll be calling
to negotiate your release.

29:26.456 --> 29:28.662
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

29:29.459 --> 29:32.625
Caitlin, when you get to know me better,

29:32.921 --> 29:34.498
you won't call me that.

29:35.256 --> 29:37.794
I have no intention
of getting to know you better.

29:39.427 --> 29:40.755
Are you sure?

29:49.562 --> 29:50.641
Special Agent Gibbs.

29:50.730 --> 29:52.770
HRT Leader Horowitz.
What do you got, Gibbs?

29:52.857 --> 29:55.609
A terrorist is holding
three of our people hostage in Autopsy.

29:55.693 --> 29:58.813
One of the hostages is wounded.
We're here. This is Autopsy.

29:58.905 --> 30:01.989
There are three exits:
Elevator, staircase, Receiving.

30:02.075 --> 30:03.302
I have Special Agents at all three,

30:03.326 --> 30:04.970
- and they're on TAC one.
- Team one, elevator.

30:04.994 --> 30:06.847
Balboa, bring the elevator
to level three for HRT.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.182
Team two, stairway, three, Receiving.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.198
Pacci, DiNozzo,
replacements are on the way.

30:10.291 --> 30:12.561
Stairwell and elevators
on the other side of the staircase.

30:12.585 --> 30:16.369
Your team three will have to access
Receiving from the alley.

30:16.464 --> 30:18.692
- Okay, let's hit it, gentlemen. Move!
- Hang on a second.

30:18.716 --> 30:22.168
These hostages are our people.
I'm in charge here, understood?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.345
Understood. Let's move out.

30:29.218 --> 30:32.219
This is a video frame
of the man holding our people hostage.

30:32.305 --> 30:33.929
- Nice smile.
- I'm sure.

30:34.015 --> 30:35.425
But do you recognise him?

30:35.516 --> 30:37.805
I just meant that
I would remember it, sir, and I don't.

30:37.894 --> 30:40.645
The detainee who gave up Qassam
might be able to identify him.

30:40.730 --> 30:42.521
I'm sorry, Director,
I was on with Tel Aviv.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.350
Did Qassam work at Little Creek?

30:44.442 --> 30:46.481
- He did.
- There's our Hamas connection.

30:46.569 --> 30:49.523
The Israelis are training
at Little Creek on hurricane boats.

30:51.407 --> 30:53.364
I should have known that, sir.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.278
See if Tel Aviv can identify him.

30:55.995 --> 30:59.744
Apparently, our hostage taker is Hamas,
but what's he after?

31:00.082 --> 31:03.083
Negotiator Arkin, Director.
If you'll open up a phone line to him,

31:03.169 --> 31:04.877
- I'll find out.
- I already know, sir.

31:04.962 --> 31:07.797
He's here to retrieve
Qassam's body and blood.

31:07.882 --> 31:08.913
Blood?

31:09.008 --> 31:11.629
Hamas doesn't want us
to know they had an infected terrorist

31:11.719 --> 31:14.803
serving burgers and fries
to American and Israeli sailors.

31:15.598 --> 31:17.306
- Get me CDC.
- Right away, sir.

31:17.391 --> 31:18.767
Infected with what?

31:18.851 --> 31:22.896
There's typhoid, anthrax, smallpox.
It could be any number of diseases.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.772
- Kate and I have been exposed.
- Maybe not.

31:24.857 --> 31:27.138
I need all the evidence
I signed in this morning, Charlie.

31:27.193 --> 31:29.102
- What?
- The evidence I signed in, now!

31:30.154 --> 31:32.443
- Why haven't we been exposed?
- If Qassam was infectious,

31:32.531 --> 31:34.109
the attack would have been successful.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.738
No need to send a cleaner
to keep us from finding out.

31:36.827 --> 31:39.864
Maybe they wanted
to delay our isolating exposed sailors

31:39.956 --> 31:41.118
to induce an epidemic.

31:41.207 --> 31:42.405
So sick!

31:42.625 --> 31:43.788
Well, it is!

31:44.126 --> 31:45.502
One of you has to sign for that!

31:48.798 --> 31:49.912
Don't wash.

31:51.634 --> 31:53.009
- I got it.
- What's up?

31:53.094 --> 31:54.469
There's two more.

31:54.553 --> 31:56.297
Qassam would not have
infected himself

31:56.389 --> 31:57.966
until he got a job on base.

31:58.057 --> 32:00.595
He would've carried the virus
in something that's here.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.511
How long was Qassam
slinging burgers?

32:02.603 --> 32:04.430
- Eight days.
- That's good news.

32:04.522 --> 32:06.894
Usually it takes longer than that
to become infectious.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.314
- Usually?
- Okay, I'm gonna start testing.

32:09.402 --> 32:12.984
Not until we get duplicates to give him.
We're not giving him the virus back.

32:13.072 --> 32:17.401
The pharmacy will have the aspirin,
the nasal spray, the breath freshener.

32:17.493 --> 32:19.699
And the nearest place to get the tea

32:21.580 --> 32:22.861
would be

32:24.667 --> 32:25.746
the Tea Peddler!

32:25.835 --> 32:27.626
2788 Connecticut Avenue.

32:29.839 --> 32:31.001
Now can I get started?

32:33.509 --> 32:35.153
How long do you think
it would have taken me

32:35.177 --> 32:36.506
to find the nearest tea shop?

32:36.595 --> 32:38.006
An hour sooner than me.

32:38.973 --> 32:40.052
I regrettably

32:40.141 --> 32:43.640
had to demonstrate the consequence
of not obeying my orders.

32:43.853 --> 32:47.802
The man I shot
is in danger of losing his arm.

32:47.898 --> 32:49.309
Well, then, it's important you...

32:49.400 --> 32:52.567
When all evidence
collected from Qassam's room

32:52.653 --> 32:53.816
is in my hands,

32:53.904 --> 32:56.063
you may have the wounded man.

32:56.198 --> 32:58.868
I'll need the approval
of the NCIS Director before I can...

32:58.951 --> 33:00.196
He's standing next to you.

33:00.411 --> 33:03.365
Nod "yes" to the negotiator,
Director Morrow.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.537
You have a deal.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.020
Now, can we talk about releasing...

33:08.044 --> 33:10.083
- You have 10 minutes.
- No, we need more...

33:25.686 --> 33:27.145
Kate...

33:27.938 --> 33:29.314
No.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.150
He wants you to try.

33:46.665 --> 33:49.832
Dr Mallard thinks that you were
daring me to pick up this knife.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.035
The proper term is a "dissecting tool."

33:53.130 --> 33:54.506
You didn't answer my question.

33:54.590 --> 33:57.461
You just wanted another excuse
to shoot Gerald, didn't you?

34:07.269 --> 34:10.638
I had no intention
of shooting Gerald again, Caitlin.

34:12.233 --> 34:15.815
I did, however, want to see
if I was right about you.

34:17.612 --> 34:19.024
Next time, I'll be quicker.

34:19.114 --> 34:21.321
Oh, don't you wonder
why you weren't now?

34:24.036 --> 34:25.993
Could you give me a go?

34:30.167 --> 34:31.958
I think not, Doctor.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.542
You would kill me without hesitation.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.793
I do, however, think you would regret it.

34:39.217 --> 34:40.297
Now,

34:40.928 --> 34:42.387
we have work to do

34:43.472 --> 34:45.465
if we're all to survive this day.

34:49.937 --> 34:52.393
It's definitely a variola smallpox.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.389
That's good news, because it's not a flat

34:54.483 --> 34:56.855
or hemorrhagic smallpox,
which is always fatal.

34:56.944 --> 34:57.975
Where'd you find it?

34:58.070 --> 35:00.857
"Up your nose"
had special meaning for this guy.

35:00.948 --> 35:03.984
- That's good work, Abby.
- Hostage taker calling.

35:04.368 --> 35:05.566
Hello.

35:05.828 --> 35:07.203
I don't know your name.

35:07.663 --> 35:09.869
Is Special Agent Gibbs there?

35:10.875 --> 35:12.583
- I don't know who that is.
- I'm here.

35:12.668 --> 35:14.043
I thought you might be.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.456
You've seen me on video.

35:17.173 --> 35:18.916
My turn to see you.

35:19.967 --> 35:21.592
Looking forward to it.

35:22.052 --> 35:24.425
Come alone. Unarmed.

35:24.972 --> 35:27.130
And don't forget Qassam's things.

35:29.477 --> 35:31.019
Got it all bagged and tagged, boss.

35:31.103 --> 35:34.437
Aspirin, breath freshener,
nasal spray and tea.

35:34.523 --> 35:38.141
Qassam drank a wimpy Darjeeling
from northwestern Kashmir.

35:38.235 --> 35:40.228
I prefer the darker,
more robust flavour of tea

35:40.321 --> 35:42.278
from the Brahmaputra area
in northeast India,

35:42.364 --> 35:44.426
where they actually take
the leaf and they rake it...

35:44.450 --> 35:45.778
- Tony?
- Yeah, boss?

35:46.744 --> 35:47.823
You nervous?

35:48.245 --> 35:50.701
Yeah. I don't like you going down there
unarmed and solo.

35:50.789 --> 35:53.874
No choice.
Besides, I need you outside Receiving.

35:54.251 --> 35:56.873
Team one? Gibbs.
Elevator to level three.

35:56.962 --> 35:59.418
By the time we get down
from Receiving, it'll be over.

35:59.507 --> 36:01.380
This guy's not a suicide bomber.

36:01.592 --> 36:03.170
He has an escape plan.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.253
Maybe to get out
the same way he came in.

36:05.346 --> 36:06.888
I want someone I know there.

36:06.972 --> 36:09.261
That's the same as saying
someone you trust?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.975
Someone you can depend on?

36:12.937 --> 36:14.395
I tested everything.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.472
The nasal spray
was the only viral container.

36:17.483 --> 36:19.772
- Thanks, Abs.
- Your best man?

36:21.237 --> 36:23.673
I don't think "best man"
was the right thing to say to someone

36:23.697 --> 36:26.023
- who's been married thrice.
- You worried?

36:26.116 --> 36:27.943
Oh, no.

36:28.285 --> 36:29.566
Yeah.

36:30.454 --> 36:31.485
Me, too.

36:52.476 --> 36:54.385
You're older than I expected.

36:57.106 --> 36:58.648
Where are the other hostages?

36:59.984 --> 37:02.735
Box on the floor.
Your hands on top of your head.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.358
Then you turn around
and walk back to the door.

37:06.073 --> 37:07.484
Not without Gerald.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.035
He won't leave here at all
unless you put the box on the floor,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.365
your hands on your head,

37:12.454 --> 37:13.735
- turn around...
- Turn around

37:13.831 --> 37:15.491
and walk back to the door.

37:17.251 --> 37:19.078
Older doesn't mean deaf.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.844
- You want out of here alive?
- I'm sure Gerald does.

37:31.056 --> 37:32.432
I think you do, too.

37:34.268 --> 37:35.513
That's why

37:36.312 --> 37:37.854
very slowly now.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.972
I'm going to reach into this box

37:41.650 --> 37:44.272
and take out of here with two fingers

37:45.404 --> 37:47.313
exactly what you want.

38:02.171 --> 38:03.285
Surprise.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.215
You failed.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.047
Mission over.

38:09.470 --> 38:12.720
The real smallpox virus
is on its way to CDC.

38:18.562 --> 38:20.887
You wanna talk about
whether you live or die?

38:24.026 --> 38:25.271
I have a shot.

38:27.738 --> 38:30.194
Negative. Too risky through glass.

38:31.492 --> 38:34.279
How far were you from Qassam
when you shot him?

38:34.953 --> 38:36.198
I don't know.

38:36.288 --> 38:38.993
You measured it
for your incident report.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.990
Thirty seven feet and a few inches,
give or take.

38:44.254 --> 38:46.164
You're a very good shot.

38:46.256 --> 38:48.000
I would love to demonstrate.

38:51.011 --> 38:52.209
Funny.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.921
Special Agent Todd
said the same thing.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.262
Where is she?

38:57.935 --> 38:59.180
And the Doctor?

39:01.980 --> 39:03.807
Would you truly like to demonstrate?

39:06.318 --> 39:07.397
Yep.

39:17.121 --> 39:20.786
Agent Todd's Sig Sauer
is in the box to your left.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.415
The clip is from the Sig Sauer.

39:26.630 --> 39:29.382
Untampered. All live rounds.

39:49.903 --> 39:50.983
Pick it up.

40:03.041 --> 40:04.156
Why?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.039
Why not?

40:11.467 --> 40:13.874
Let's go! Go, go! Go, go, go! Come on!

40:24.480 --> 40:26.805
Target's down! I got him! Over here!

40:36.742 --> 40:38.900
Boss? Boss?

40:40.120 --> 40:41.496
Hey, boss.

40:41.622 --> 40:44.077
Listen, don't try to sit up. Don't

40:44.833 --> 40:46.078
sit up.

40:46.168 --> 40:48.741
EMTs will be here in a minute.
It's a through-and-through.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.913
- Nothing vital.
- We get him?

40:51.590 --> 40:52.753
Yeah, you got him.

40:58.764 --> 41:00.507
I've got to get down there.

41:06.188 --> 41:07.730
Well, you were right, boss.

41:07.815 --> 41:11.148
He had an accomplice in HRT gear
inside the Receiving elevator.

41:11.276 --> 41:14.111
Shot both the HRT guys
before I nailed him.

41:14.363 --> 41:16.190
One of them's dead.
The other's gonna make it.

41:16.281 --> 41:17.740
Where are Kate and Ducky?

41:18.033 --> 41:20.441
Right here.
He had them in the body cooler.

41:28.126 --> 41:29.621
How'd you get him, Gibbs?

41:43.642 --> 41:44.922
I didn't.

41:50.190 --> 41:52.646
The way he escaped
was always his backup plan.

41:52.734 --> 41:54.170
He just needed someone
he could count on

41:54.194 --> 41:56.401
to shoot him in the chest,
to trigger the assault.

41:56.488 --> 41:59.240
Gibbs figures he was
wearing a bulletproof vest all along.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.576
He was. I felt it.

42:03.245 --> 42:04.324
You felt it?

42:09.668 --> 42:11.744
Well, how close did you get to feel it?

42:13.130 --> 42:14.672
Close enough to touch him.

42:15.883 --> 42:17.756
With your hands,
or did you touch him with...

42:17.843 --> 42:20.334
Close enough to stab him
with a knife in my hand.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.044
And you didn't?

42:24.391 --> 42:25.506
No.

42:28.478 --> 42:29.937
Stockholm syndrome?

42:30.022 --> 42:32.429
You can't identify
with your captor in an hour.

42:32.649 --> 42:33.812
Oh, I don't know.

42:34.234 --> 42:35.894
Maybe it's like falling in love.

42:36.111 --> 42:37.190
It can happen

42:38.530 --> 42:39.693
like that.
