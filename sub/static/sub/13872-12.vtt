<i>Gentlemen, you have reached
Dr. Weird's residence.</i>

00:13.380 --> 00:15.007
<i>Now speak at the tone.</i>

00:15.749 --> 00:19.685
<i>Hello, Dr. Wire... Wired... Weird.</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:23.254
Steve, send the phone spiders.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.518
<i>...works with
Chauna Construction Company.</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:28.789
<i>With spring here, we thought
you might be interested in a new deck.</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.893
<i>- Spiders. Get them off.
- I guess we're not interested.</i>

01:22.649 --> 01:23.741
Carl?

01:28.354 --> 01:31.949
- Carl. Open the door.
- Damn it.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.692
- I got a gift for you.
- Go away.

01:36.496 --> 01:39.727
I'm so tired of this.
Friggin' go away, you freak.

01:41.568 --> 01:45.060
- Did you lose something behind the couch?
- I did. I lost peace and quiet!

01:45.138 --> 01:48.733
What do you need? What do you want?
Can I not just live here...

01:48.808 --> 01:51.777
without having to occasionally
deal with you animals?

01:51.845 --> 01:54.211
- Well, yeah. It's your house.
- That's right, it is.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.305
And look what I just added to it.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.912
Nice, a crapper.

01:58.985 --> 02:02.421
That's no ordinary toilet.
That toilet is environmentally friendly.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.390
Know how much water is used up
every time you flush the toilet?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.256
- I give. What?
- Three gallons.

02:09.229 --> 02:13.893
- Wow, what a waste. The poor children.
- This one uses highly compressed air...

02:13.967 --> 02:17.562
creating a super vacuum which completely
obliterates all waste upon impact.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.367
Goody. So I should sort of
let the neighbors know...

02:20.440 --> 02:23.273
that I'm gonna be kind of,
you know, exposing myself...

02:23.343 --> 02:26.244
four to five times a day,
depending on what I eat?

02:26.312 --> 02:29.281
Maybe we could sell some tickets.
"Come by and take pictures.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.613
"This where I do my business
from now on".

02:31.684 --> 02:33.151
No, this is the best part.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.382
Press this button and an infrared
privacy curtain is activated...

02:36.456 --> 02:38.253
rendering you virtually invisible.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.782
<i>Okay. So, sort of
like that movie Predator...</i>

02:41.861 --> 02:44.022
only instead of hunting people,
he's crapping.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.793
<i>Or the Hollow Man.
You choose your science fiction fantasy.</i>

02:46.866 --> 02:49.334
You'll be living it
every time you go to the bathroom.

02:49.402 --> 02:51.199
Go ahead, try it out.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.029
I don't need to go right now.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.631
- That's cool. I mean, I'll wait.
- No, you won't.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.677
I get it. You want to be alone
when you go to the...

02:58.745 --> 03:02.374
By the way, we also made you a little
care package for your new adventure.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.246
Oh, boy, fiber tablets. Yum-yum.

03:05.318 --> 03:09.152
Yeah. Dip them in the stool softener.
I mean, it's delicious.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.822
- There's espresso there, too, if you...
- Leave!

03:13.893 --> 03:15.292
Did he do number two yet?

03:15.361 --> 03:17.955
Damn, he drank all the coffee
and half those tablets...

03:18.031 --> 03:19.055
and he still hasn't gone.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.498
Shoot, that boy's gonna
poop himself inside out.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.263
He's gonna lift right off the ground.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.964
It'll be like the Hulk,
ripping out the back of his pants.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.666
- Shut up, Meatwad.
- Okay.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.667
But it's gonna smell like a paper mill.
You know that, don't you?

03:31.744 --> 03:33.439
Why are we doing this? This seems sick.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.640
The supertoilet needs
to be tested on humans...

03:35.715 --> 03:37.512
before I can actually apply for a patent.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.451
He ain't gonna poop in the yard.
He'll go inside to do that.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.614
- Not if his door's locked.
- By God, I got to go!

03:43.690 --> 03:45.954
I just can't go, you know,
when people watch me.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.356
We don't need a toilet.

03:47.427 --> 03:51.090
The pile of clothes in the hallway
has worked fine for us for years...

03:51.164 --> 03:52.722
and it will continue to work.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.826
I don't know whose clothes that is.
Somebody ain't wearing that again.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.430
Where's the invisible thing? Screw it.
I got to do this.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.064
Shut up, he's about to sit down.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.008
Let me see. I don't want to see that.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.911
Nobody wants to see that.
What are you trying to do, kill me?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.142
I thought you was
gonna make him invisible.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.515
- I can't afford to do that.
- That has been burned into my retinas.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.350
Look. We'll be cool
as long as the police don't drive by.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.855
Put down the phone, Shake.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.519
What? I was cleaning.
The dial is very dirty.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.256
Look at them bras. Yeah.

04:24.864 --> 04:28.561
Man, I ain't trying to watch
Carl take no criznap, baby.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.933
He's just sitting there
reading with his pants down.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.801
Naked, I might add.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.568
And for god's sake,
burn those moles off, will you?

04:35.642 --> 04:39.510
- Every time someone flushes...
- Yes. I know. Three gallons!

04:42.882 --> 04:45.248
Shut up. I said that first till you copied me.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.309
- You did not.
- I did, too.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.687
See? I did it again. I'm pretty good.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.854
- Shut up. You're ruining my moment.
- Yeah. Your moment. His movement.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.687
I got a book coming out.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.392
Okay. That wasn't too bad.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.730
Where's the friggin' flush on this thing?

05:05.238 --> 05:06.330
God!

05:15.648 --> 05:18.344
Gentlemen, we have the technology.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.447
We can rebuild him.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.579
And there you go, Carl.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.750
You may feel a little stiffness tomorrow,
but that'll be natural.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.386
Just while we're on the subject,
can I use your pool?

05:29.462 --> 05:31.521
- Yes, Meatwad, you may.
- Okay. Thank you.

05:31.597 --> 05:34.657
So there's the head.
I've been looking all over for that thing.

05:34.734 --> 05:38.602
Don't act like it's yours.
It's Carl's head, and he been using it...

05:38.671 --> 05:42.971
to tell me I can go swimming and...
Can I drink some beer?

05:43.042 --> 05:45.704
- Help yourself. It's in the back.
- And drink his beer.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.643
You know what, Carl? I thank you...

05:47.714 --> 05:51.241
and I will take you up on your generous
offer and have some of your beer.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.547
- Shake can't have any.
- You tell him, Carl.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.053
The head can't stay
unattached from his body for long.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.146
Look. He's attached.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.691
It ain't going nowhere.
It's bungeed to the tree.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.886
Shut up, Shake, you know what I mean.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.061
What's this thing here?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.564
I'm keeping his head alive
with electrical impulses...

06:06.632 --> 06:09.601
and the computer's able to translate
his brain output into text.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.399
Really? Is that an "f"?
He's dropping F-bombs over here.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.441
Don't look over here.
These are words you don't need to learn.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.705
I'm gonna start dropping F-bombs.
Listen. Fart you, farthead.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.269
That's not how F-bombs
are dropped, you idiot.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.145
- Come on, Shake.
- The fart it is, farter.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.242
Fart all y'all. Y'all go fart yourself.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.547
Chief, where do you want this?

06:27.620 --> 06:29.247
You drove that thing through town?

06:29.322 --> 06:31.517
It's cool. I stayed on the shoulder
the whole way.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.081
At least bring it through the back.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.593
You heard him.
Bring it through the farting back.

06:36.763 --> 06:37.889
Damn it, Shake.

06:37.964 --> 06:41.195
You said the back.
What is this, the front now?

06:41.267 --> 06:43.758
All the nerves are connected.
I think we're ready.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.395
- Carl, can you hear me?
- What happened there?

06:47.473 --> 06:51.705
What? We don't know.
We're just glad you're all right.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.644
I mean, you don't remember
what happened, do you?

06:54.714 --> 06:56.443
I remember some things.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.574
I'm just not too clear on being...

07:00.086 --> 07:01.576
so old and black.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.088
Why am I black,
and where did I get this suit?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.887
- It's ridiculous.
- This is not a time for you to be picky.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.223
That's all you can get
when you go to the west end.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.729
Get it off! Rip it off!
What am I doing? Oh, God!

07:11.798 --> 07:15.598
- Oh, no. The body's rejecting the head!
- You think? Get it off me!

07:15.668 --> 07:16.930
Hang on.

07:18.805 --> 07:19.931
So, did it work?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.871
- Of course it worked.
- No, it didn't.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.877
Of course it worked not at all,
which is what I was trying to say...

07:25.945 --> 07:28.004
before I was so rudely interrupted.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.776
Take this body back,
and not through town.

07:30.850 --> 07:34.718
Mail call. Frylock, letter for you.

07:34.921 --> 07:39.255
Meatwad, get a life. The rest for me.

07:39.525 --> 07:43.689
- Good, the Passaic organ bank.
- Yeah. I dealt with these yackos directly.

07:43.763 --> 07:47.597
"Dr. Frylock, while we appreciate your
interest in body construction research...

07:47.667 --> 07:50.830
"we cannot legally send you
a 'butt load' of organs...

07:50.903 --> 07:53.030
"regardless on whether
we plan on using them".

07:53.105 --> 07:57.940
I didn't say "butt load".
I said "ass load". Bureaucrats.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.945
To think I was polite with these people.
That's the worst part.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.244
- What's that big old box outside?
- Yes, someone did respond.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.376
It's soggy. Where the fart is it from?

08:06.452 --> 08:11.082
- "wegotussomemedicalwaste. com".
- You call this organic?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.523
You look in the box.
All they sent were eyeballs.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.255
- I'm not going near that box.
- Let's just see if it works.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.561
Wait a minute. Before you turn him on,
do you think he'll be able to see us?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.260
In ways you can only imagine.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.498
But, look, I mean,
is he gonna be able to chase us?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.698
Because if I woke up looking like that...

08:27.773 --> 08:30.799
I would just run towards
the nearest living thing and kill it.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.400
Check me out. I'm Shaun Cassidy.

08:33.479 --> 08:36.039
- Put those back, they're not for you.
- That's a good one.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.673
What the hell are you talking about?

08:37.750 --> 08:41.186
When he was a Hardy boy,
and, you know, they was private eyes.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.049
Plus, he had, like, 10 eyes in his head.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.316
- Okay. I'll give it to you.
- Hello. Is anyone here?

08:48.394 --> 08:50.726
Why do my knees feel
like they want to tear up?

08:50.796 --> 08:52.696
- Carl. It works.
- What works?

08:52.765 --> 08:55.461
All of them, look. Get it when I say look?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.163
Just walk over here, Carl.
Let's see if your legs work.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.671
You got to study me, like a pupil.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.640
Okay, hang on a sec.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.570
- That hurts so bad.
- Don't worry about that, Carl.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.946
Your feet are made of eyeballs,
but they'll toughen up over time.

09:11.017 --> 09:15.215
- May I see a mirror, please?
- All right. Here you go, Shaun Cassidy.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.714
Gross.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.351
What are you, an idiot?
Never heard of Shaun Cassidy?

09:21.427 --> 09:25.124
So that explains the breeze
I've been feeling in my thighs.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.630
We'll craft some synthetic lids...

09:26.699 --> 09:28.326
then you'll be able to walk normally.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.390
Why do that?

09:29.468 --> 09:32.926
Why don't we just blow my brains out now
and save yourself some time?

09:33.005 --> 09:36.839
Look. Carl. This is gonna hurt,
but try to take another step towards me.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.605
Believe me. I will. I'm coming for you.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.173
Give me a hug, Fryman.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.946
- That's tight.
- I'm gonna hug the breath right out of you.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.486
Meatwad, unplug him.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.654
Okay. Plan C.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.792
I give you the ultimate
in military hardware...

09:55.861 --> 09:59.695
complete with laser cannon,
indestructible titanium exoskeleton...

09:59.765 --> 10:02.666
and motion-activated plasma-pulse rifles.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.566
And you're gonna plug him in?

10:04.637 --> 10:06.798
You're right. Damn.
What the hell was I thinking?

10:06.872 --> 10:08.533
- Fudge.
- That's not an F-bomb.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.632
Fudge you.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.970
Turn it left. I keep hitting the same spot.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.910
Look. You're gonna break my friggin' nose.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.973
- I still haven't gotten the hang...
- Just give me the damn thing.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.315
The steering wheel makes it go
left and right, this switch is power.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.618
Which button turns me to the lawyer,
and makes me sue you?

10:24.690 --> 10:27.284
Easy, Carl,
don't make me have to shut the power off.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.420
Don't do that.
Just sort of put it on my chin.

10:30.496 --> 10:33.727
I'll friggin' steer it with my tongue.

10:34.834 --> 10:38.600
That may not work.
Let's just get Meatwad to drive you home.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.828
Meatwad.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.403
- Get him off me, please.
- Yes?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.601
I didn't mean it!

10:43.676 --> 10:46.338
Everything I say to you,
I mean about myself!

10:46.412 --> 10:49.074
- Shut up. I'll make it worse.
- Not in the house.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.616
No, I need to live!

10:51.684 --> 10:54.152
<i>- Zone in target.
- Target locked in.</i>

10:55.554 --> 10:57.784
Got him. Fudge you, butt hole.
