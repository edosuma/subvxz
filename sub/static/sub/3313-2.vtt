WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:08.738
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:08.739 --> 00:11.341
HEY, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE THIS.

00:11.342 --> 00:13.643
WHY, THANK YOU. NEW DRESS.
LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

00:13.644 --> 00:16.616
OH, CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.789
YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN
ARGUING WITH ME ABOUT ANYTHING LATELY.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.121
WE'RE GETTING ALONG REALLY WELL.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.422
OH MY GOD, ARE YOU DYING?

00:22.423 --> 00:24.354
NO.

00:24.355 --> 00:25.355
ARE YOU?

00:25.356 --> 00:27.558
( chuckles ) PLEASE. LOOK AT ME.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.600
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS
WE'RE GETTING ALONG SO WELL

00:30.601 --> 00:32.662
IS BECAUSE I'M FINALLY DATING
SOMEBODY I REALLY LIKE.

00:32.663 --> 00:34.464
YOU KNOW, ERIC IS NICE,

00:34.465 --> 00:36.536
HOT, SMART,

00:36.537 --> 00:37.737
HOT.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.210
I'M NOT EVEN FREAKED OUT
THAT HE'S A SINGLE PARENT.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.412
I'M FINALLY DATING
A REAL GROWN-UP.

00:42.413 --> 00:43.673
A HOT ONE.

00:43.674 --> 00:45.475
YOU KNOW, I AM ACTUALLY ALSO

00:45.476 --> 00:47.477
DATING A GROWN-UP WHO
IS ALSO VERY HOT.

00:47.478 --> 00:50.150
- AND COINCIDENTALLY, LAUREN...
- LA LA LA LA. DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.621
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON
WE'RE GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

00:51.622 --> 00:53.683
YOU HAVE YOUR
THING, I HAVE MINE.

00:53.684 --> 00:54.784
WE SHOULD JUST KEEP
OUR THINGS SEPARATE.

00:54.785 --> 00:56.626
AGREED. OUR THINGS...

00:56.627 --> 00:58.488
WILL NEVER TOUCH.

00:58.489 --> 00:59.629
( doorbell rings )

00:59.630 --> 01:00.830
MM.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.632
THAT'S ERIC. GET SEPARATE FAST.

01:02.633 --> 01:03.634
GLADLY.

01:06.637 --> 01:08.098
- HEY, SEXY...
- HEY.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.369
LITTLE KID.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.142
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

01:12.143 --> 01:13.603
I BROUGHT A WINGMAN.

01:13.604 --> 01:14.674
MEL, THIS IS DANIEL.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.806
HEY, LITTLE MAN.

01:16.807 --> 01:19.380
I DON'T MEAN LITTLE. I MEAN,
YOU'LL PROBABLY GROW.

01:20.611 --> 01:22.682
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.284
MY EX... ( whispers
) THE DRAGON LADY,

01:24.285 --> 01:25.615
( normal voice )
FLAKED ON ME AGAIN.

01:25.616 --> 01:27.687
JUST GAVE ME ONE OF
HER SURPRISE TEXTS.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.489
I UNDERSTAND.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.162
YOU'RE THE RESPONSIBLE ONE
SO YOU PICK UP THE SLACK.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.294
YOU MUST BE PICKING UP A
LOT OF SLACK THESE DAYS,

01:34.295 --> 01:35.495
'CAUSE YOU ARE VERY
FIRM UP THERE.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.726
( both chuckle )

01:36.727 --> 01:39.098
SORRY FOR THE CHANGE OF PLANS.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.202
WHAT? I'M SORRY, I WAS
IN MY HAPPY PLACE.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.834
HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OUT
WITH DANIEL AND I TONIGHT?

01:44.835 --> 01:47.177
I CAN PROMISE YOU
SOME CRAPPY PIZZA,

01:47.178 --> 01:49.379
A BALL PIT AND A LOUD
OBNOXIOUS CLOWN.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.341
SURE. YEAH, I'M EASY...

01:51.342 --> 01:53.743
TO GET ALONG WITH.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.415
- HEY, ERIC.
- HI, JOE.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.387
- IS THAT YOUR KID?
- SURE IS.

01:57.388 --> 01:58.748
HEY, WHAT'S UP, BUDDY. I'M JOE.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.290
WHAT ARE THESE FOR?

02:00.291 --> 02:02.652
WELL, YOU CAN DO A LOT
OF THINGS WITH THOSE.

02:02.653 --> 02:04.494
YOU CAN JUGGLE.
SEE, LOOK AT THAT.

02:04.495 --> 02:05.495
NOT A VERY GOOD JUGGLER,

02:05.496 --> 02:07.727
BUT GUESS WHAT?
LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.898
- I GOT YOUR NOSE.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

02:08.899 --> 02:10.500
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW
THAT'S YOUR NOSE?

02:10.501 --> 02:11.701
'CAUSE THERE'S A BIG
GREEN BOOGER IN IT.

02:11.702 --> 02:13.333
- LOOK AT THAT.
- ( laughing )

02:13.334 --> 02:15.435
KIDS, THEY LOVE
THE BOOGER MAGIC.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.906
DADDY, CAN WE TAKE HIM WITH US?

02:16.907 --> 02:18.238
HE'S AWESOME.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.769
NO. THE PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING

02:19.770 --> 02:22.413
ALREADY HAS AN OBNOXIOUS CLOWN.

I GOTTA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS
MATH TEST THAT I GAVE YOU.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.939
WHAT? I TRIED MY HARDEST.

02:49.940 --> 02:51.572
YEAH, YOU PUT "C"
FOR EVERY ANSWER.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.244
WELL, WAS IT WRONG EVERY TIME?

02:54.245 --> 02:55.876
IT WASN'T MULTIPLE CHOICE.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.449
YOU KNOW, I'M
GETTING THE FEELING

02:59.450 --> 03:00.880
YOU'RE NOT REALLY FOCUSING
ON YOUR SCHOOLWORK.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.512
IT'S 'CAUSE I'M NOT THERE.

03:02.513 --> 03:05.715
EVER SINCE I GOT SUSPENDED,
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.317
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,

03:07.318 --> 03:09.719
BUT I MISS SCHOOL.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.522
AW, I FEEL FOR YOU, BUDDY.

03:12.523 --> 03:13.663
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SO UNFAIR

03:13.664 --> 03:15.926
THAT ON YOUR SCHOOL FIELD
TRIP YOU HAD TO GO SMOKE POT.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.329
LENNOX, YOU'RE STILL AT SCHOOL.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.630
TELL ME ONE THING
THAT'S HAPPENING THERE.

03:20.631 --> 03:21.771
THROW ME A BONE.

03:21.772 --> 03:24.374
UM... OH, OKAY.
HERE'S SOMETHING.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.635
ALL THE CUTE GIRLS
THAT YOU LIKE,

03:25.636 --> 03:27.678
THEY STILL DON'T KNOW YOU EXIST.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.780
WHICH ONES EXACTLY?

03:30.781 --> 03:31.812
LENNOX?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.644
HEY, THERE SHE IS.

03:34.645 --> 03:36.646
SO TELL ME, HOW WAS YOUR
DATE AT THE BALL PIT?

03:36.647 --> 03:37.647
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
I FORGOT.

03:37.648 --> 03:38.818
WE'RE KEEPING THINGS SEPARATE.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.790
SCREW SEPARATE.
THAT WASN'T A DATE,

03:40.791 --> 03:42.492
IT WAS TORTURE. LOOK
WHAT THAT KID DID TO ME.

03:42.493 --> 03:43.653
LOOK AT IT.

03:43.654 --> 03:45.725
PIZZA, COTTON CANDY,

03:45.726 --> 03:46.826
SOY SAUCE.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.360
WE KIND OF PIZZA
JOINT HAS SOY SAUCE?

03:50.361 --> 03:52.532
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
THESE THINGS TO THE DRY CLEANERS.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.664
ALTHOUGH, ACTUALLY,
IT MAY BE MORE HUMANE

03:54.665 --> 03:57.537
TO JUST TAKE THIS ONE
OUT BACK AND SHOOT IT.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.668
AND THAT SNEAKY LITTLE MONSTER

03:58.669 --> 04:00.470
WAITED UNTIL HIS DADDY
WAS OFF GETTING TOKENS,

04:00.471 --> 04:01.471
AND THEN BLAM-O.

04:01.472 --> 04:02.712
PIZZA TO THE ASS?

04:02.713 --> 04:03.973
PIZZA TO THE ASS.

04:03.974 --> 04:06.516
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

04:06.517 --> 04:07.777
I HAVE TO GET DANIEL TO LIKE ME

04:07.778 --> 04:08.818
IF I'M GOING TO KEEP ERIC.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.019
WELL, HERE'S A NOVEL IDEA.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.651
WHY DON'T YOU TRY WORKING
ON YOUR PARENTING SKILLS?

04:11.652 --> 04:12.882
TRY RELATING TO THE KID.

04:12.883 --> 04:13.883
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
IT ON HIS LEVEL.

04:13.884 --> 04:15.785
AND KIDS NEED RULES AND LIMITS.

04:15.786 --> 04:17.727
OKAY, WHAT MAKES YOU
SUCH A PARENTING EXPERT?

04:17.728 --> 04:20.029
SAYS THE WOMAN WHO
HIRED ME AS HER NANNY.

04:20.030 --> 04:22.292
YEAH, I WAS DESPERATE, REMEMBER?

04:22.293 --> 04:23.993
I TOLD YOU, ALL RIGHT? I
TOLD YOU A MILLION TIMES.

04:23.994 --> 04:26.536
I HAVE A BIG FAMILY. I HAVE
LOTS OF NIECES AND NEPHEWS.

04:26.537 --> 04:27.667
SERIOUSLY. ASK ANYONE IN JERSEY.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.798
I'M LIKE A TOTAL KID MAGNET.

04:28.799 --> 04:31.671
OH, THAT CANNOT SOUND CREEPIER.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.672
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

04:32.673 --> 04:34.874
I AM ALSO DATING A
SINGLE PARENT, OKAY?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.676
LAUREN IS A MOM. SHE
HAS A DAUGHTER.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.678
AND TODAY, I'M MEETING
HER DAUGHTER DIDI.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.310
AND THE THINGS I GOT PLANNED...

04:40.311 --> 04:43.053
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA. SEPARATE.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.659
WOW, ZANDER,

04:49.660 --> 04:52.422
THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
BLOODY SKULL I'VE EVER SEEN.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.665
YEAH, THE BLOOD-SUCKING
LEECHES SPELL OUT "MOM."

04:56.667 --> 04:58.668
IT'S GONNA BE A TATTOO
FOR MY BUDDY EVAN.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.299
CAN YOU DO ONE FOR ME?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.031
( chuckles )

05:02.032 --> 05:04.534
WHAT? I'M SERIOUS.

05:04.535 --> 05:06.336
WHAT KIND OF TATTOO
WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME?

05:06.337 --> 05:07.837
DON'T GET A TATTOO.

05:07.838 --> 05:09.539
WHY NOT?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.681
'CAUSE TATTOOS ALWAYS
LOOK TRASHY ON GIRLS.

05:11.682 --> 05:13.082
WHAT?

05:13.083 --> 05:14.684
THAT IS A TOTAL DOUBLE STANDARD.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.816
NO, IT'S A FACT.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.519
YEAH, A FACT ACCORDING
TO SEXIST PIGS.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.721
ALL I MEANT WAS THAT TATTOOS
AREN'T FOR NICE GIRLS.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.553
OH, I'M A NICE GIRL.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.396
SO NOW YOU'RE LABELING ME?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.658
WELL...

05:28.659 --> 05:30.730
YOU KNOW, HOW ABOUT
WE STOP TALKING

05:30.731 --> 05:32.332
AND JUST KISS?

05:33.664 --> 05:35.836
SORRY. NICE GIRLS DON'T DO THAT.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.509
( doorbell rings )

05:39.510 --> 05:40.841
COMING.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.813
HEY THERE. COME ON IN, LADIES.

05:43.814 --> 05:45.545
I AIN'T A LADY. I'M A BOY.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.676
( chuckles )

05:46.677 --> 05:48.478
OH, I'M SORRY. IT'S
JUST, YOU SAID DIDI,

05:48.479 --> 05:49.479
SO I FIGURED GIRL.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.821
OH, THOSE ARE HIS INITIALS. D.D.

05:51.822 --> 05:54.654
OH, WELL THAT'S OKAY, YOU KNOW?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.886
I'M JUST GONNA KEEP THE
PRINCESS DRESS FOR ME.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.688
( chuckles )

05:58.689 --> 06:00.630
LISTEN, I'M JUST GONNA
GO USE THE POTTY

06:00.631 --> 06:03.763
BEFORE WE GO. THAT IS
SUCH A MOM THING TO SAY.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.364
HEY, WHEN YOU'RE A HOT
MOM, YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING

06:05.365 --> 06:06.436
AND IT SOUNDS SEXY.

06:06.437 --> 06:08.738
HOW ABOUT "CARPOOL"?

06:08.739 --> 06:11.471
STILL SEXY.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.674
- JUICE BOX.
- YOU ARE KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.447
HEY, JOE. YOU GONNA JUGGLE?

06:17.448 --> 06:20.109
HOW'D YOU KNOW I COULD JUGGLE?

06:20.110 --> 06:21.751
DANIEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:21.752 --> 06:23.883
NO NO NO NO NO NO. THIS IS D.D.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.555
DANIEL DAVIDSON.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.086
YOU MET HIM TWO NIGHTS AGO.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.157
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

06:28.158 --> 06:30.020
NO...

06:32.022 --> 06:34.093
LOOK AT THAT. IT'S THE SAME KID.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.695
HOLY CRAP. IT'S THE SAME KID.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.026
( gasps )

06:37.027 --> 06:40.770
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
DATING THE DRAGON LADY.

06:40.771 --> 06:43.402
AND YOU'RE DATING THE
WORLD'S OLDEST FRAT BOY.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.034
OH, GROSS.

06:45.035 --> 06:46.105
OUR THINGS TOUCHED.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.508
( groans )

06:48.509 --> 06:49.779
HEY, AND JUST FOR THE RECORD,

06:49.780 --> 06:51.911
- LAUREN, SHE'S NOT...
- NOT WHAT?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.544
NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHAT
WE JUST FOUND OUT.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.685
- ( chuckles )
- THIS IS...

06:55.686 --> 06:56.886
IT'S SO FUNNY, HONEY.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.688
IT'S HILARIOUS, ACTUALLY.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.019
UH, GUESS WHAT?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.692
MEL'S DATING DADDY.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.024
HUH? ( chuckles )
IT'S A SMALL WORLD.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.956
SO SMALL.

07:06.957 --> 07:08.929
AWKWARD.

07:17.908 --> 07:19.438
RYDER,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.070
IT'S 10:00 AT NIGHT.
YOU'RE MAKING BREAKFAST?

07:21.071 --> 07:22.842
WHAT'S IT MATTER WHEN
I DO ANYTHING, JOE?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.113
DAY, NIGHT, IT'S ALL THE SAME.

07:24.114 --> 07:26.175
I'M HERE ALL THE TIME. I
DON'T GET TO SEE MY FRIENDS.

07:26.176 --> 07:29.219
AND HOLLY DUMPED ME BECAUSE I'M
A "LOSER WITH A DRUG PROBLEM."

07:31.051 --> 07:33.653
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS...

07:33.654 --> 07:35.655
Both: I MISS SCHOOL.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.986
YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME?

07:36.987 --> 07:39.759
YEAH, I'M MAKING FUN OF YOU.
YOU SAY THAT 50 TIMES A DAY.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.890
HERE'S A NOVEL IDEA,
IF YOU MISS SCHOOL,

07:40.891 --> 07:42.762
WHY DON'T YOU TRY DOING
YOUR SCHOOLWORK?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.234
ALL RIGHT, THIS ART PROJECT HAS BEEN
SITTING OVER HERE FOR THREE DAYS.

07:45.235 --> 07:46.836
COME ON, LOOK. IT
SAYS RIGHT HERE.

07:46.837 --> 07:48.898
"USE RECYCLED MATERIALS

07:48.899 --> 07:51.070
TO MAKE AN ASSEMBLAGE THAT SAYS
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF."

07:51.071 --> 07:53.773
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD
USE AN OLD TIRE TO SAY

07:53.774 --> 07:55.174
"I WISH SOMEONE
WOULD RUN ME OVER."

07:55.175 --> 07:57.978
SEE, WE'RE POPPING NOW.
WE'RE COMING UP WITH STUFF.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.781
I'M NOT INSPIRED HERE, JOE.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.053
AT LEAST AT SCHOOL I COULD
SEE LAURA JENKINS WALK BY

08:04.054 --> 08:06.055
IN HER BELLY SHIRT,
AND SHORT SHORTS

08:06.056 --> 08:08.858
AND LEATHER BOOTS, AND...

08:08.859 --> 08:12.922
I SEE THE PAINFUL BREAKUP WITH
HOLLY IS SCABBING OVER QUITE WELL.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.924
LOOK, MAN UP, ALL RIGHT?

08:14.925 --> 08:16.726
GET YOUR ART PROJECT
DONE BY THURSDAY.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.227
THURSDAY? WHEN IS THURSDAY, JOE?

08:18.228 --> 08:20.771
TOMORROW? THE NEXT DAY? I
DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYMORE.

08:23.974 --> 08:26.005
HE SEEMS TO BE
EATING FROM THE PAN.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.637
YEAH, HE MISSES SCHOOL.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.910
WELL, I GUESS IT'S BETTER
THAN SMOKING FROM THE POT.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.242
SO TONIGHT ON YOUR DATE,

08:33.243 --> 08:34.914
DID THE FACT THAT WE'RE DATING

08:34.915 --> 08:36.946
TWO HALVES OF A DIVORCED
COUPLE SEEM TO COME UP?

08:36.947 --> 08:39.248
ACTUALLY, IT DID, ALONG WITH
A VERY INTERESTING ANECDOTE

08:39.249 --> 08:40.249
THAT I PROMISED NOT TO REPEAT.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.250
GOOD. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.792
HERE IT IS.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.253
DID YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE TIME

08:44.254 --> 08:46.596
THAT YOUR JERKY BOYFRIEND
WAS MARRIED TO LAUREN,

08:46.597 --> 08:48.658
HE NEVER ONCE... NEVER ONCE
BOUGHT HER A BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

08:48.659 --> 08:49.659
AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHY?

08:49.660 --> 08:50.930
- NO, I WOULD NOT.
- GOOD.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.931
I'LL TELL YOU.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.933
SHE HAS ISSUES
WITH HER BIRTHDAY,

08:53.934 --> 08:56.666
AND REFUSED TO LET HIM
ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN ANY WAY.

08:56.667 --> 08:57.937
WELL SURE, YEAH.
AFTER HE SENT HER

08:57.938 --> 09:00.109
THAT CRINGY SINGING
PIRATE-GRAM TO HER OFFICE.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.311
BECAUSE "PIRATES OF THE
CARIBBEAN" IS HER FAVORITE MOVIE.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.944
NOT ANYMORE. THE GUY GOT DRUNK
AND CUT HER LEG WITH A SWORD.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.776
THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:06.777 --> 09:08.177
- YES IT IS.
- OH, WERE YOU THERE?

09:08.178 --> 09:09.919
AS MUCH AS YOU WERE.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.550
OKAY, THIS IS WEIRD, RIGHT?
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.823
I KNOW. NORMALLY WE JUST ARGUE
ABOUT OUR OWN PROBLEMS.

09:13.824 --> 09:14.924
YEAH.

09:14.925 --> 09:16.255
IF WE START TO FIGHT
THEIR BATTLES,

09:16.256 --> 09:18.227
WHEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE ANY
TIME FOR OUR OWN ARGUMENTS?

09:18.228 --> 09:19.589
NO NO NO NO NO. UH-UH.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.260
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. NO.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.632
YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIX IS?

09:22.633 --> 09:24.033
MM. I DO.

09:24.034 --> 09:26.796
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH ERIC.
- WHAT? NO.

09:26.797 --> 09:28.838
YOU HAVE TO BREAK
UP WITH LAUREN.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.670
I STARTED DATING ERIC WAY BEFORE
YOU TWO STARTED GOING OUT.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.871
IT WAS THE SAME DAY.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.673
WE HAD LUNCH. YOU HAD DINNER.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.705
LUNCH WINS.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.346
LOOK, I MADE A
CONNECTION WITH THE KID.

09:37.347 --> 09:38.948
OKAY? I HAVE INNATE
PARENTING SKILLS.

09:38.949 --> 09:40.610
NO, YOU HAVE INEPT
PARENTING SKILLS.

09:40.611 --> 09:41.651
YOU DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HIM.

09:41.652 --> 09:42.682
HE WAS WEARING A HAT.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.015
OH, HE'S A MASTER OF DISGUISE.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.587
LOOK, THE KID LIKES ME, OKAY?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.919
I MEAN, IT'S CLEAR
THAT I WOULD BE

09:49.920 --> 09:51.991
THE GREATEST STEPDAD
OF ALL TIME.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.793
WELL, HE'LL LIKE ME TOO.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.964
EVENTUALLY.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.966
YOU DO REALIZE HE'S GONNA
BE LEAVING FOR COLLEGE

09:56.967 --> 09:58.928
IN 12 YEARS. I'VE KNOWN
YOU THREE YEARS NOW,

09:58.929 --> 10:00.970
AND I'M ONLY UP TO LIKE "MEH."

10:00.971 --> 10:03.903
WELL, I AM NOT
BREAKING UP WITH ERIC.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.004
I'M NOT BREAKING UP WITH LAUREN.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.235
- FINE.
- FINE.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.107
I'M ALSO NOT LEAVING
THIS KITCHEN FIRST.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.239
NEITHER AM I.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.643
DAMN, I GOTTA PEE.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.992
WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU GET FIRED?

10:22.993 --> 10:24.654
NO.

10:24.655 --> 10:26.025
I'M DOING MY ART PROJECT
LIKE JOE'S MAKING ME.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.396
OH, THAT'S GOOD. SEE?

10:27.397 --> 10:29.058
THROW YOURSELF INTO
YOUR SCHOOLWORK.

10:29.059 --> 10:30.259
COULD YOU NOT SAY "SCHOOL"?

10:30.260 --> 10:32.301
I'M JUST KIND OF
FRAGILE RIGHT NOW.

10:32.302 --> 10:34.033
( doorbell rings )

10:34.034 --> 10:34.935
FOR ME. IT'S FOR ME.

10:34.936 --> 10:37.066
SEPARATE LIFE COMING THROUGH.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.068
- HEY.
- HEY THERE.

10:39.069 --> 10:40.139
- HOW YOU DOING?
- SORRY.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.941
I KNOW IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE JUST US,

10:41.942 --> 10:43.412
BUT MR. RESPONSIBILITY

10:43.413 --> 10:44.974
DIDN'T SHOW UP AT
SCHOOL ON TIME.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.276
THAT'S OKAY. I LOVE HAVING
THE LITTLE GUY AROUND.

10:47.277 --> 10:49.018
OH, ME TOO.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.419
'CAUSE HE'S SUCH A CUTIE.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.951
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:51.952 --> 10:52.952
WHY DON'T YOU AND
JOE STILL GO OUT,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.353
AND DANIEL CAN
STAY HERE WITH ME.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.025
DAD'S FUN GIRLFRIEND, MEL.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.256
NO. I DON'T...

10:57.257 --> 10:58.958
- REALLY? YOU WOULDN'T MIND?
- NOT AT ALL.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.389
HEY, KIDDO. LET'S...

11:00.390 --> 11:01.691
OH, I GOT YOUR NOSE.

11:01.692 --> 11:04.333
OHH! REAL BOOGERS.

11:04.334 --> 11:07.066
WHICH I LOVE. LIKE
ALL GOOD PARENTS DO.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.237
( chuckles )

11:08.238 --> 11:09.368
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:09.369 --> 11:10.940
WHY DON'T WE MAKE
A COOKIE PIZZA?

11:10.941 --> 11:13.072
- I'LL RACE YOU TO THE KITCHEN.
- YAY!

11:13.073 --> 11:14.273
SEE, THE KID LIKES ME.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.106
KID LIKES SUGAR.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.808
OKAY, DANIEL.

11:18.809 --> 11:20.950
YOU PLAY WITH THESE
BOWLS AND SPOONS

11:20.951 --> 11:22.982
WHILE I CALL THE BAKERY
AND ORDER A COOKIE PIZZA.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.113
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA MAKE ONE?

11:24.114 --> 11:25.855
OH, BUT ORDERING IS
SO MUCH MORE FUN.

11:25.856 --> 11:27.686
BUT I LIKE LICKING SPOONS.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.020
WELL, YOU CAN LICK THE PHONE.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.863
AUNT MEL, I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.825
ZANDER IS TELLING ME
WHAT I CAN AND CAN'T DO

11:35.826 --> 11:36.866
BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.427
- IS THIS ABOUT SEX?
- NO.

11:38.428 --> 11:39.829
- DRUGS?
- NO.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.300
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE A STRONG

11:41.301 --> 11:42.772
INDEPENDENT YOUNG WOMAN.

11:42.773 --> 11:44.303
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.835
WELL, EXCEPT DATE A DRUMMER.

11:45.836 --> 11:46.976
'CAUSE THAT JUST ENDS BADLY.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.108
OKAY. THANKS.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.811
HI, YES. I NEED A
COOKIE PIZZA STAT.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.814
MEL BURKE. YOU HAVE MY
CREDIT CARD ON FILE.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.746
NO HIDING IN THE OVEN.

11:56.747 --> 11:57.748
SWEETIE?

11:58.949 --> 11:59.949
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T MIND

11:59.950 --> 12:01.290
LEAVING DANIEL HERE?

12:01.291 --> 12:02.752
BECAUSE I THINK HE'D HAVE
A LOT MORE FUN WITH ME.

12:02.753 --> 12:04.253
I MEAN, WITH US.

12:04.254 --> 12:05.955
YEAH, BUT IF HE STAYS HERE,

12:05.956 --> 12:08.998
WE CAN GO HAVE SOME
ADULTS-ONLY FUN.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.760
SEE YOU LATER, DANIEL.

12:10.761 --> 12:11.832
( chuckles )

12:12.963 --> 12:14.834
- COME ON.
- WHERE WERE YOU?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.936
YOUR TEXT SAID TO MEET
YOU THERE AT 4:00.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.039
YEAH, AND THERE IS THE SCHOOL.
OBVIOUSLY.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.771
OH YEAH, IT WAS SO OBVIOUS

12:21.772 --> 12:23.142
THAT I SHOWED UP
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.414
HEY, I THOUGHT I HEARD
YOUR HANDSOME VOICE.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.846
DID WE HAVE PLANS?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.848
NO. MY EX-WIFE SUCKS AT TEXTING.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.080
AND MY EX-HUSBAND
SUCKS AT LISTENING.

12:31.081 --> 12:32.281
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:32.282 --> 12:34.283
HEY GUYS, LET'S JUST ALL
BRING IT DOWN HERE A NOTCH.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.385
OKAY? CLEARLY THE TEXTING
THING HAS NOT BEEN WORKING.

12:36.386 --> 12:37.887
JOE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

12:37.888 --> 12:38.988
I AM?

12:38.989 --> 12:40.759
WHAT? IT HAPPENS.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.961
I'M GUESSING YOU GUYS
HAVEN'T HAD AN ACTUAL

12:41.962 --> 12:43.392
FACE TO FACE CONVERSATION
IN SOME TIME?

12:43.393 --> 12:45.865
( overlapping arguing )

12:45.866 --> 12:47.536
BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP.
OKAY, TELL YOU WHAT.

12:47.537 --> 12:48.868
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO SIT DOWN.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.239
OKAY? LET'S SIT ON
THE COUCH THERE.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.971
OKAY, LET'S GO SIT DOWN.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.044
WE'LL TRY TO WORK OUT A LITTLE
SCHEDULE HERE FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.346
WE CAN ALL ACT LIKE
RESPONSIBLE ADULTS.

12:57.347 --> 12:59.308
YES, AND I WILL TAKE
DANIEL TO THE PARK.

12:59.309 --> 13:00.350
NOT IF I TAKE HIM FIRST.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.884
( dance music playing )

13:08.318 --> 13:09.458
I WANT A TATTOO.

13:09.459 --> 13:11.821
BIG ONE.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.292
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.524
CHINESE CHARACTERS,
HEARTS, BUTTERFLIES?

13:15.525 --> 13:16.966
NONE OF THAT POSEUR CRAP.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.567
I WANT THE TRASHIEST
THING YOU'VE GOT.

13:18.568 --> 13:20.299
LET ME SHOW YOU MY FAVE.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.973
WORKS FOR ANKLE, BUTT,
OR TRAMP STAMP.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.976
OH, WHAT... OH! EW! NO.

13:26.977 --> 13:28.838
( winces )

13:28.839 --> 13:31.040
MAYBE SOMETHING TRASHY-LITE,

13:31.041 --> 13:34.014
AND PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES A LITTLE LESS SHAVING?

13:38.849 --> 13:40.990
I KNOW HOW TO COUNT TO 100.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.151
YOU SHOWED US.

13:42.152 --> 13:43.422
MORE THAN ONCE.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.224
I CAN TELL TIME TOO.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.395
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

13:46.396 --> 13:47.556
I'M VERY CONNECTED TO THIS.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.098
LET ME HAVE IT.

13:49.099 --> 13:50.960
NO. IT'S OLD AND VALUABLE.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.233
- I HATE YOU.
- HERE YOU GO.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.435
THAT WAS GREAT PARENTING, BURKE.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.207
THE WAY YOU JUST GAVE IN
TO THAT MANIPULATION.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.209
WOULD YOU RATHER HEAR
HIM COUNT SOME MORE?

14:00.210 --> 14:01.540
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.042
YEAH.

14:03.043 --> 14:03.974
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER WATCH?

14:03.975 --> 14:05.074
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
ONE I GAVE YOU?

14:05.075 --> 14:07.076
I THREW IT IN THE HOLE.

14:07.077 --> 14:08.547
GOT IT IN THE FIRST TIME.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.049
OH NO. THE STORM DRAIN?

14:10.050 --> 14:10.981
JOE, GET IT!

14:12.983 --> 14:14.853
IS IT IN THERE?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.485
OH, THERE IT IS. OKAY.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

14:16.486 --> 14:18.327
NO, I CAN'T.

14:18.328 --> 14:20.129
I CAN'T QUITE REACH IT.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.061
SEE, I HAVE THE GIRTH, BUT DON'T
QUITE HAVE THE LENGTH ON MY ARM.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.862
- ALL RIGHT. MOVE OVER.
- IT'S BIG.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.064
I'VE GOT TO GET IT OUT.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.295
THAT'S MY DEAD GRANDMA'S WATCH.

14:26.296 --> 14:28.037
WHAT'S "DEAD" MEAN?

14:28.038 --> 14:29.899
THAT'S NICE, BURKE.
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

14:29.900 --> 14:31.300
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THE
KID THERE'S NO SANTA CLAUS?

14:31.301 --> 14:32.471
THERE'S NO WHAT?!

14:32.472 --> 14:34.174
NOTHING. GROWN-UPS TALKING.

14:35.205 --> 14:36.345
( door closes )

14:36.346 --> 14:38.047
YOU NEVER LISTEN.

14:38.048 --> 14:40.549
I SIGN HIM UP FOR KARATE
BECAUSE HE LIKES IT.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.282
SURE. HE NEEDS A WAY TO
WORK OUT HIS AGGRESSION.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.654
I WONDER WHERE HE
GETS THAT FROM.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.886
( sighs )

14:47.887 --> 14:49.318
WOW.

14:49.319 --> 14:50.889
THERE'S PEOPLE.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.061
( sighs )

14:52.062 --> 14:53.192
I'M SORRY.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.523
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
ELSE WAS HERE.

14:54.524 --> 14:56.465
I'M LAUREN. THIS IS ERIC.

14:56.466 --> 14:57.997
WE'RE FRIENDS OF MEL AND JOE.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.071
DRAGON LADY AND
PETER PAN, RIGHT?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.274
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.076
THAT WATCH IS 100 YEARS OLD.

15:07.077 --> 15:08.137
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR A NEW ONE.

15:08.138 --> 15:11.140
NO. I'M GETTING THIS ONE OUT.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.213
WE JUST NEED A SKINNY
TOOL TO GRAB IT.

15:16.546 --> 15:18.317
I GOT ONE.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.089
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT PUTTING HIM DOWN THERE?

15:20.090 --> 15:21.590
OH, PLEASE. I USED
TO PUT MY BROTHERS

15:21.591 --> 15:23.122
DOWN THESE STORM
DRAINS ALL THE TIME.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.194
HEY, WHO FEELS LIKE GOING
ON A LITTLE ADVENTURE

15:25.195 --> 15:26.195
TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.

15:26.196 --> 15:27.426
- ME!
- YOU DO.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.998
COME ON. GET IN THERE.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.060
YEAH, I'M TELLING YOU, THESE
STORM DRAINS WERE LIKE

15:31.061 --> 15:32.201
A SECOND HOME TO US.

15:32.202 --> 15:33.332
ALL THE RICH KIDS
HAD TREE HOUSES,

15:33.333 --> 15:34.563
BUT WE HAD THE GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED GUTTERS.

15:34.564 --> 15:35.965
I GOT IT.

15:35.966 --> 15:37.136
HE GOT IT.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.607
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. HERE WE GO.

15:38.608 --> 15:40.239
NOW GIVE ME YOUR HAND. LET'S
GET YOU OUT OF THERE.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.011
COME ON. COME HERE.

15:42.012 --> 15:43.412
HOLD ON. CAN YOU STAND
ON YOUR TIPPY-TOES?

15:43.413 --> 15:45.545
CAN I... UH-OH.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.218
YEAH, I CAN'T REACH HIM.

15:49.219 --> 15:52.021
OKAY, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
TAKING THE PROPER STEPS.

15:52.022 --> 15:54.483
FIRST I'M GONNA TAKE A
DEEP CLEANSING BREATH...

15:54.484 --> 15:56.025
( inhales )

15:56.026 --> 15:57.687
AND THEN I'M GONNA PANIC.

16:02.732 --> 16:04.133
OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:04.134 --> 16:05.464
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S ON THEIR WAY.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.665
GOOD. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET HERE

16:06.666 --> 16:07.666
BEFORE IT STARTS GETTING DARK

16:07.667 --> 16:09.068
AND ALL THE RATS COME OUT.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.001
THE CUTE LITTLE RATS.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.402
I'M BORED.

16:13.403 --> 16:15.044
AW, COME ON NOW. THERE'S LOTS OF

16:15.045 --> 16:16.305
FUN THINGS YOU CAN
DO DOWN THERE.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.608
YEAH. LET'S PLAY DON'T
TOUCH ANYTHING.

16:19.609 --> 16:21.750
ESPECIALLY IF IT HAS EYES.

16:21.751 --> 16:23.482
CAN I PLAY A GAME ON YOUR PHONE?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.753
FINE.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.985
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.218
JUST DON'T LOOK AT THE PHOTOS.

16:29.219 --> 16:31.490
- ( cellphone ringing )
- LOOK, IT'S DADDY ON YOUR PHONE.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.292
I SAID DON'T LOOK AT THE PHOTOS.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.763
- ( beeps )
- NO, HE'S CALLING.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.096
- HI, DADDY.
- HANG UP. HANG UP.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.998
DADDY, GUESS WHERE I AM?

16:40.370 --> 16:42.131
YOU HAD TO GIVE HIM YOUR PHONE.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.633
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DIDN'T PUT
HIM DOWN THE STORM DRAIN.

16:44.774 --> 16:46.476
OH, LIKE YOU'RE
SUCH GREAT PARENTS.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.609
( murmurs )

16:50.610 --> 16:52.111
HOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA HURT?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.243
YOU EVER BEEN SHOT?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.046
NOT AS BAD AS THAT.

16:57.547 --> 16:59.448
WAIT! WAIT. WAIT.

16:59.449 --> 17:00.749
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
TALKING ME OUT OF THIS.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.021
I KNOW. YOU TWEETED
"GETTING A TATTOO.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.124
HASHTAG DON'T TALK
ME OUT OF IT."

17:05.125 --> 17:06.056
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

17:06.057 --> 17:07.626
NO, I JUST...

17:07.627 --> 17:09.358
I WANTED TO SAY THAT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.629
LENNOX, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.101
DAMN STRAIGHT.

17:12.102 --> 17:13.632
BUT IF YOU WERE
GONNA GET A TATTOO,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.765
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
WANT A CUSTOM DESIGN.

17:17.307 --> 17:18.567
SO YOU'D MAKE ME ONE?

17:18.568 --> 17:19.709
I ALREADY DID.

17:22.172 --> 17:23.642
WOW.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.044
THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.676
IT'S JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF TRASHY

17:27.677 --> 17:28.818
FOR A NICE GIRL LIKE ME.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.284
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. YOU TURN
YOUR BACK FOR ONE SECOND,

17:35.285 --> 17:37.286
AND WITHOUT ANY
PROMPTING FROM US

17:37.287 --> 17:40.629
AND THE KID JUST THROWS
HIMSELF IN A STORM DRAIN.

17:40.630 --> 17:42.591
YOU KNOW, KIDS ARE SO CURIOUS.

17:42.592 --> 17:43.762
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THEM.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.764
THEY'RE JUST SO CURIOUS.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.796
- WHERE IS HE?
- WHERE'S MY BABY?

17:47.797 --> 17:49.798
HI, MAMA.

17:49.799 --> 17:52.201
HONEY. WHAT HAPPENED?

17:52.202 --> 17:54.443
JOE PUT ME IN A BIG
HOLE IN THE GROUND

17:54.444 --> 17:55.704
AND SAID THERE'S NO SANTA.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.646
WHAT?!

17:57.647 --> 17:59.578
WELL NOW, WHEN HE
SAYS IT LIKE THAT,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.650
IT SOUNDS BAD.

18:01.651 --> 18:02.811
SHE WANTED ME TO GET HER WATCH.

18:02.812 --> 18:03.812
IS THAT TRUE, MEL?

18:03.813 --> 18:05.384
WELL, IN MY DEFENSE,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.756
YOUR SON THREW IT IN THE HOLE.

18:07.757 --> 18:09.558
AND MY PHONE, PLEASE?

18:09.559 --> 18:10.789
AW, SUCH A GOOD KID.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.193
AND LOOK... A SCRATCH TO
ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS DAY BY.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.624
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU TWO.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.566
YOU'RE BOTH HORRIBLE
HORRIBLE PEOPLE.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.298
WHOA WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.630
ERIC, LAUREN, LET'S JUST
BRING THINGS DOWN A NOTCH.

18:21.631 --> 18:22.771
I THINK WE CAN ALL
TALK ABOUT THIS

18:22.772 --> 18:23.803
LIKE CALM, REASONABLE PEOPLE.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.576
YOU GUYS ARE BREAKING
UP WITH US, RIGHT?

18:27.577 --> 18:29.879
- RIGHT.
- YES, WE ARE.

18:33.283 --> 18:35.314
OKAY, DID YOU SEE THE
SMILE ON DANIEL'S FACE

18:35.315 --> 18:36.615
WHEN THEY PULLED HIM OUT
OF THAT STORM DRAIN?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.786
THAT KID HAD A BLAST.

18:37.787 --> 18:39.618
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'D
MAKE GOOD PARENTS.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.320
YEAH. WE'D MAKE GREAT PARENTS.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.891
LOOK AT THE JOB WE'RE DOING
WITH LENNOX AND RYDER.

18:42.892 --> 18:44.653
THEY'RE CLEAN. THEY'RE FED.

18:44.654 --> 18:45.854
THEY'RE DOING GREAT IN SCHOOL.

18:45.855 --> 18:48.227
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHO
DIDN'T GET KICKED OUT.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.428
YOU KNOW WHAT? ONE FOR TWO.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.799
BATTING 500 PUTS YOU
IN THE HALL OF FAME,

18:50.800 --> 18:52.261
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.463
HEY, LENNOX. WHAT'S NEW?

18:54.464 --> 18:56.305
OH, NOT MUCH.

18:56.306 --> 18:58.308
JUST THIS BITCHIN' TATTOO.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.909
HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE IT?

19:00.910 --> 19:02.912
ENOUGH TO KILL THE
GUY THAT DID IT.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.376
SWEETIE, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST?

19:07.377 --> 19:09.778
RELAX. IT'LL WASH
OFF IN A MONTH.

19:09.779 --> 19:13.151
HONEY, THAT'S NOT
HOW TATTOOS WORK.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.454
NO. ZANDER DREW IT ON ME.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.625
IT'S NOT REAL.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.327
OH. ( chuckles )

19:18.328 --> 19:19.328
( sighs )

19:19.329 --> 19:20.929
( gasping )

19:20.930 --> 19:22.661
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.794
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH I AM HIP
AND DOWN WITH THE TATS.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.667
I WAS GONNA GET A REAL ONE,

19:28.668 --> 19:30.469
BUT THEN I THOUGHT OF
YOU AND I REALIZED

19:30.470 --> 19:31.840
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.272
YOU SEE?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.844
SHE HEARS MY WISE COUNSEL
IN HER HEAD AT ALL TIMES.

19:35.845 --> 19:37.176
I'M LIKE A SHAPELY
BLONDE BUDDHA.

19:39.609 --> 19:40.849
YEAH, ACTUALLY,

19:40.850 --> 19:41.850
I JUST THOUGHT
ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE

19:41.851 --> 19:44.182
THAT LITTLE FADED PIG
TATTOO LOOKS ON YOUR...

19:44.183 --> 19:45.384
AH, NOT ABOUT ME.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.256
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.
BACK UP, BACK UP, BACK UP.

19:47.257 --> 19:48.787
NO, I WANT TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT THIS LITTLE PIGGY.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.820
LIKE WHERE DOES IT LIVE?

19:52.522 --> 19:53.792
OKAY, IT'S A CHUBBY DEVIL.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.724
AND WE WILL NEVER
DISCUSS WHERE HE LIVES.

19:55.725 --> 19:57.566
OH, COME ON. GIVE ME A HINT.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.569
YOU SITTING ON HIM?

20:04.674 --> 20:06.976
IS HE ASLEEP BETWEEN
TWO PILLOWS?

20:12.982 --> 20:14.443
( grunts )

20:14.444 --> 20:15.784
TO QUALITY PARENTING.

20:15.785 --> 20:16.985
YES.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.617
QUALITY PARENTING.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.249
BY THE WAY, WHERE'S RYDER?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.820
I HAVE NO CLUE.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.652
OH, HE'S BEEN IN
THE GARAGE ALL DAY

20:23.653 --> 20:26.495
WITH A BUNCH OF DUCT TAPE
AND SOME BOX CUTTERS.

20:26.496 --> 20:27.826
YEAH, I WAS KIND OF
WORRIED ABOUT HIM,

20:27.827 --> 20:30.630
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO GO ALL THE
WAY BACK THERE AND CHECK.

20:39.509 --> 20:40.540
HEY, BUDDY.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.543
HOW YOU DOING?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.615
REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.277
HOW DO YOU GUYS
LIKE MY NEW SCHOOL?

20:48.278 --> 20:50.679
OKAY, YOU DO REALIZE THIS ISN'T
A REAL SCHOOL, RIGHT, HONEY?

20:50.680 --> 20:53.522
YEAH, OF COURSE. THIS
IS MY ART PROJECT.

20:53.523 --> 20:55.524
I MISS SCHOOL SO MUCH
THAT I MADE MY OWN.

20:55.525 --> 20:57.386
WOW.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.687
YOU REALLY CAPTURED IT.

20:58.688 --> 21:01.490
IT EVEN SMELLS LIKE SCHOOL.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.832
YEAH, THAT'S GRILLED CHEESE.

21:03.833 --> 21:06.336
AND SEXUAL FRUSTRATION.

21:08.838 --> 21:10.639
WELL, HOW COME YOU'RE
SITTING ALL ALONE

21:10.640 --> 21:13.642
INSTEAD OF OVER HERE
WITH YOUR BUDDIES?

21:13.643 --> 21:16.646
I CAN'T SIT THERE. THAT'S
THE COOL KIDS' TABLE.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.978
YOU KNOW WHAT, DUDE?
"A-PLUS," MAN.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.910
SERIOUSLY, GREAT WORK.
YOU KEEP THIS UP,

21:21.911 --> 21:24.283
YOU CAN START BUILDING
YOURSELF A GREAT COLLEGE.
