00:22.381 --> 00:25.036
<i>Look at the water.</i>

00:26.927 --> 00:28.787
<i>- What's this?
- Towel.</i>

00:28.846 --> 00:31.085
<i>- What kind of towel?
- Super towel.</i>

00:31.140 --> 00:34.673
<i>What does the super towel get
the super boy? Super clean, right?</i>

00:34.727 --> 00:36.718
<i>Super boy.</i>

00:36.895 --> 00:40.678
<i>That's super boy.
Super, super clean.</i>

00:41.191 --> 00:42.969
<i>Super wet.</i>

00:45.654 --> 00:47.113
<i>Who's this?</i>

00:47.114 --> 00:48.594
<i>Jeremiah.</i>

00:49.533 --> 00:52.354
<i>He's a Jeremiah.</i>

00:52.411 --> 00:54.319
It's Jeremiah versus Moby Dick.

00:54.371 --> 00:57.656
<i>Jeremiah was a bullfrog</i>

00:58.292 --> 01:00.899
<i>Was a good friend of mine</i>

01:01.003 --> 01:05.580
<i>Never understood a
single word he said</i>

01:05.716 --> 01:09.534
<i>But I helped him drink his wine</i>

01:10.262 --> 01:13.416
<i>Singing joy to the world</i>

01:15.142 --> 01:17.880
<i>All the boys and girls now</i>

01:18.687 --> 01:21.129
<i>Joy to the fishes
In the deep blue sea</i>

01:21.190 --> 01:23.181
<i>Joy to you and me</i>

01:23.233 --> 01:26.138
- Yes, this is Dr. Cooper.
- What's that?

01:26.361 --> 01:29.099
Superman. Super nothing.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.894
That's super nothing!

01:32.368 --> 01:35.189
That's right, super boy is not
getting out of this tub...

01:35.245 --> 01:37.189
until he's as clean as a whistle.

01:37.623 --> 01:40.492
And super mom is going
to be very happy.

01:41.043 --> 01:43.200
I can't move that far.

01:43.253 --> 01:45.327
Come here. Come here. Head on down.

05:55.631 --> 05:57.455
Down onto the end.

05:58.384 --> 05:59.746
Come on.

06:02.137 --> 06:04.045
Right on down there.
There's a spot.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.175
- Harold.
- Sam.

06:14.024 --> 06:15.469
Christ.

06:18.153 --> 06:19.931
- Here, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.932
Let me put it in here.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.810
You can drive this to the cemetery.

06:24.868 --> 06:26.527
Oh, Christ.

06:28.539 --> 06:30.197
Were you here?

06:30.708 --> 06:34.407
What? No, Alex was staying
down here at the summer house.

06:34.461 --> 06:38.113
Sarah and I were up at the
Richmond place with the kids.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.993
- Well, you're looking fit.
- So are you.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.264
Listen...

07:02.364 --> 07:04.604
I want you to sit with Chloe.

07:04.700 --> 07:08.269
I've got to be up there, and it's a
little tricky with Alex's folks.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.809
I understand.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.323
Who's Chloe?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.907
It's Alex's girlfriend.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.626
I'll take care of her.

07:30.934 --> 07:32.961
Chloe, this is Michael.

07:32.978 --> 07:34.459
This is Chloe.

07:50.245 --> 07:51.726
Do you want to sit up with us?

07:51.789 --> 07:55.073
I'm going to sit here by
myself for a while, okay?

08:27.658 --> 08:29.233
Sometimes...

08:29.576 --> 08:32.528
it is hard for us to believe...

08:32.871 --> 08:34.779
that the good Lord had a plan.

08:35.541 --> 08:38.313
This is one of those times.

08:39.336 --> 08:42.822
I didn't know Alex
Marshall personally.

08:43.006 --> 08:46.207
But after speaking
with his loved ones...

08:46.260 --> 08:48.452
I feel that I do.

08:49.596 --> 08:54.672
A brilliant physics student at
the University of Michigan...

08:55.227 --> 09:00.219
who paradoxically chose to
turn his back on science...

09:00.774 --> 09:03.382
and taste of life
through a seemingly...

09:03.444 --> 09:06.728
random series of occupations.

09:29.011 --> 09:31.784
When a man like Alex...

09:31.847 --> 09:35.796
chooses to leave us, there is
something wrong in this world.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.960
I'm a pallbearer.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.755
This is not Alex.

09:43.358 --> 09:47.141
This is the empty
shell of his body.

09:48.363 --> 09:50.770
Alex is spirit now.

09:53.077 --> 09:56.728
But why are we left with this?

09:57.331 --> 09:59.358
It makes me angry.

09:59.416 --> 10:03.661
And I don't know what
to do with my anger.

10:04.630 --> 10:08.662
Are not the satisfactions
of being a good man...

10:08.717 --> 10:10.791
among our common men...

10:11.678 --> 10:15.129
great enough to sustain us anymore?

10:16.475 --> 10:20.459
Where did Alex's hope go?

10:22.064 --> 10:25.016
Maybe that is the
small resolution...

10:25.067 --> 10:27.936
we can take from here today.

10:29.405 --> 10:31.147
To try to...

10:31.448 --> 10:33.855
regain that hope...

10:35.035 --> 10:38.022
that must have eluded Alex.

11:13.657 --> 11:15.766
I did know Alex.

11:20.998 --> 11:23.072
And I loved him.

11:29.131 --> 11:32.996
See here today all those
people that Alex loved.

11:37.264 --> 11:41.129
Not all of us have been able to see
each other much these last years.

11:44.646 --> 11:46.886
But neither time nor distance...

11:48.317 --> 11:50.556
could break the bonds that we feel.

11:54.656 --> 11:57.893
Alex drew us together
from the beginning.

11:58.827 --> 12:01.399
Now he brings us together again.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.443
I don't know...

12:06.877 --> 12:08.868
why this happened.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.450
But I do know...

12:13.967 --> 12:17.204
that there was always
something about Alex...

12:19.390 --> 12:22.211
that was too good for this world.

12:31.693 --> 12:33.222
I only hope...

12:35.572 --> 12:37.931
that wherever he is now...

12:52.631 --> 12:53.495
Burial...

12:53.757 --> 12:57.326
will be at Westglade Memorial Park.

12:57.886 --> 12:59.664
There will be a reception...

12:59.722 --> 13:03.540
at the home of Harold
and Sarah Cooper...

13:03.600 --> 13:05.840
immediately following.

13:06.729 --> 13:08.589
And now...

13:09.398 --> 13:14.059
Karen Bowles, an old
college friend of Alex's...

13:14.236 --> 13:18.350
will play one of
Alex's favourite songs.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.076
Nicholas, this is Richard.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.039
Pleasure to meet you.

14:59.425 --> 15:02.080
I just met Meg earlier.
Just before the...

15:02.136 --> 15:03.830
Can I go over there?

15:05.681 --> 15:07.423
Sam Weber, this is Richard.

15:07.474 --> 15:12.170
Really enjoy your TV show.
My boys and I watch it all the time.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.547
Thank you. Well, we'll
see you out there.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.248
What is this?

16:23.926 --> 16:26.083
It's pretty strong stuff.

16:29.139 --> 16:30.881
I feel terrible.

16:33.352 --> 16:36.921
Last time I spoke with
Alex, we had a fight.

16:37.773 --> 16:39.551
I yelled at him.

16:40.484 --> 16:43.389
That's probably why
he killed himself.

16:51.954 --> 16:54.146
What was the argument about?

16:56.959 --> 16:59.780
I told him he was wasting his life.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.258
You all right?

17:19.772 --> 17:20.803
Yeah.

17:20.816 --> 17:24.800
I'm a little disappointed, though.
I wanted to ride up there.

17:27.406 --> 17:30.441
I've always wanted
to ride in a limo.

17:35.414 --> 17:37.357
I do half my work in limos.

17:37.416 --> 17:39.276
Are you a chauffeur?

17:40.044 --> 17:41.275
No, a journalist.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.741
<i>I write for People magazine.</i>

17:48.677 --> 17:51.249
I can't believe you're still
mad about that thing.

17:51.263 --> 17:53.171
This isn't the time. Just drop it.

17:53.265 --> 17:58.210
I will if you will. Today most of all
we should remember we're friends.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.261
And you're an actor?

18:14.328 --> 18:16.770
Nothing like you described.
Not at all.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.399
Not one of those people looks
like I thought they would.

18:20.459 --> 18:25.487
I can't believe these are the people
you've talked about all these years.

18:27.132 --> 18:30.499
I'd love to hear the way
you describe me to them.

19:51.467 --> 19:56.412
Amazing tradition. They throw you a
party on the one day you can't come.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.545
So how long were they together?

20:04.605 --> 20:06.299
Four months.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.180
Can't believe it.

20:13.697 --> 20:16.305
His funeral and she's stoned.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.523
Karen and I are staying here tonight.
We fly back to Detroit in the morning.

20:23.582 --> 20:24.778
Are you staying?

20:24.833 --> 20:27.240
I have to fly out
to Dallas tonight.

20:27.294 --> 20:30.614
I'm interviewing a 14-year-old
blind baton twirler.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.492
Where do you get those stories?

20:36.845 --> 20:39.417
It's just good
investigative journalism.

20:39.681 --> 20:41.210
- How's your life?
- Great.

20:41.266 --> 20:43.044
- Yours?
- Not so great.

20:44.478 --> 20:46.256
We're telling the truth.

20:46.355 --> 20:48.346
You heard about my divorce.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.300
Yeah, I'm really sorry.

20:51.026 --> 20:52.685
Are you J.T. Lancer?

20:52.820 --> 20:55.511
No, no, that's the
character I play.

20:55.572 --> 20:56.852
I'm Sam Weber.

20:57.157 --> 21:00.311
Can I have your autograph,
whoever you are?

21:00.828 --> 21:03.186
You think it's time we should
be thinking about Alex?

21:03.247 --> 21:04.478
I'll give you a buck.

21:04.707 --> 21:06.566
Okay, you're on.

21:13.132 --> 21:15.953
You'd never get a crowd
this big at my funeral.

21:16.176 --> 21:19.911
Come on. I'll come,
and I'll bring a date.

21:22.599 --> 21:25.753
I know this is hard for you,
but it's all beautiful.

21:26.603 --> 21:28.511
We put on a great funeral here.

21:28.564 --> 21:30.258
Maybe I'll have mine here too.

21:30.315 --> 21:34.015
We give first preference to people
who kill themselves in our bathroom.

21:37.489 --> 21:40.145
That was a terrible thing to say.

21:40.909 --> 21:43.067
I don't know why I said that.

21:45.372 --> 21:48.063
That's why I don't smoke anymore.
Dope makes me stupid.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.819
You talking about me?

21:49.918 --> 21:52.444
Here's the guy who did this to me.

21:52.629 --> 21:54.988
I no longer know how to
handle myself stoned.

21:55.049 --> 21:57.870
You don't have to handle
yourself with us.

21:59.094 --> 22:01.002
Will you marry me?

22:03.223 --> 22:04.799
Both of you?

22:09.646 --> 22:12.682
That shit they got about your
marriage wasn't from me.

22:12.733 --> 22:15.568
I didn't know they were doing a
story, or why you don't believe me.

22:15.569 --> 22:17.429
- Let's drop it!
- Say you believe me.

22:17.488 --> 22:19.764
I believe you.
I always believe you.

22:19.865 --> 22:23.730
Honest to God, I know it's crap.
That's why I'm getting out.

22:23.827 --> 22:26.435
Yeah? What're you going to do?

22:26.872 --> 22:28.815
I'm opening a club.

22:28.916 --> 22:30.444
No shit!

22:30.709 --> 22:34.159
Like Elaine's, but hipper.
Elaine's is dead.

22:36.882 --> 22:38.327
You got the money?

22:38.592 --> 22:39.990
Almost, almost.

22:40.844 --> 22:42.289
Well, let me know.

22:42.346 --> 22:43.744
What do you mean?

22:44.890 --> 22:46.881
I might be interested.

22:47.893 --> 22:49.172
Really?

22:51.563 --> 22:53.970
So you and Alex were staying here?

22:53.982 --> 22:56.258
We have a room downstairs.

22:56.276 --> 22:57.674
Well, we did.

22:57.736 --> 22:59.181
I do.

23:00.364 --> 23:02.106
I found him.

23:02.116 --> 23:03.774
God, it must have been awful.

23:03.867 --> 23:06.274
It was. It was a real mess.

23:06.870 --> 23:08.565
What will you do now?

23:09.081 --> 23:10.526
We cleaned it up.

23:14.336 --> 23:16.078
Are you going to stay here?

23:16.171 --> 23:18.245
Yeah, till Sarah kicks me out.

23:18.298 --> 23:20.871
I'm sure she'd never do that.

23:24.263 --> 23:27.001
That's right, if I may.
That's why I'm calling, Jim.

23:27.057 --> 23:31.089
That way, I can have a piece for
you this week and next week...

23:31.186 --> 23:34.091
Give me a break.
I'll fly to Dallas on Monday.

23:34.148 --> 23:36.921
She won't regain her
eyesight over the weekend.

23:37.025 --> 23:40.262
I know, but I think I've got
something good right here.

23:40.362 --> 23:42.555
I don't know. It's
about everything.

23:42.656 --> 23:45.430
Suicide, despair, where
did our hope go...

23:45.492 --> 23:47.981
Lost hope. That's it, lost hope.

23:48.996 --> 23:50.904
You think everything's boring.

23:50.998 --> 23:54.448
You wouldn't say that if it
was the "Lost Hope Diet."

23:59.006 --> 24:00.700
Michael's office called.

24:00.758 --> 24:02.997
He doesn't have to be
in Dallas till Monday.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.669
He asked to stay the weekend.

24:04.762 --> 24:07.120
Harold, you didn't.

24:07.181 --> 24:10.298
What could I say? He knows
that Sam is staying...

24:10.350 --> 24:12.377
and Karen, Richard and Meg.

24:12.478 --> 24:14.469
Meg's not staying.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.345
Well, actually...

24:20.194 --> 24:21.639
Where will we put them?

24:21.695 --> 24:23.112
We'll make room.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.689
Hi, guys.

24:28.077 --> 24:29.652
- Hey, Nick.
- How you doing?

24:31.080 --> 24:32.394
Good.

24:33.207 --> 24:35.115
Advertising's all right.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.243
A lot of bullshit with
clients and stuff.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.121
But it's all right.

24:40.255 --> 24:42.199
It's a decent living.

24:42.508 --> 24:45.543
Not as much as we spend, of course.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.837
Just kidding. It's exactly
as much as we spend.

24:48.889 --> 24:53.466
What have you got, an oil leak?
Can I give you a hand?

24:59.441 --> 25:01.183
I think I got it.

25:05.155 --> 25:08.190
I feel like I have never
been alone in my own house.

25:08.575 --> 25:13.272
Never. Either Richard is there,
or the boys or the housekeeper.

25:13.372 --> 25:16.489
Remember those lab rats who went
crazy when deprived of privacy?

25:16.583 --> 25:18.693
They're living with you too?

25:19.753 --> 25:22.195
- Should we push the beds together?
- Why?

25:22.256 --> 25:24.744
Okay. How about further apart?

25:25.676 --> 25:28.793
In January we open in Greensboro.

25:28.846 --> 25:32.130
And in April, our second
store in Charleston.

25:32.224 --> 25:34.002
How many is that now?

25:34.101 --> 25:36.424
Twenty-seven and twenty-eight.

25:37.020 --> 25:40.221
Better watch out. Some big
monster will buy you.

25:40.274 --> 25:42.051
We've had offers.

25:44.570 --> 25:47.474
Who would've thought we'd
both make so much bread?

25:47.573 --> 25:49.600
Two revolutionaries.

25:51.827 --> 25:54.352
Good thing it's not
important to us.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.981
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke.

26:05.132 --> 26:07.490
Chloe. Hi, you there?

26:12.514 --> 26:14.422
I just wanted to...

26:15.309 --> 26:16.671
make sure you're okay.

26:16.769 --> 26:19.008
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

26:21.690 --> 26:23.550
Thanks, Michael.

27:34.471 --> 27:35.869
Come along?

27:35.931 --> 27:37.590
Are you kidding?

28:21.351 --> 28:24.173
So I'm in the Philadelphia
Public Defender's office.

28:24.229 --> 28:28.048
<i>My clients were the scum of
the earth. Extreme repulsivos.</i>

28:29.109 --> 28:31.717
One of them got
caught in the house.

28:31.779 --> 28:35.430
He and his friends beat up the
husband, rape the wife...

28:35.491 --> 28:37.517
then tried to blow the place up.
When I ask what happened, he says:

28:37.576 --> 28:39.056
"I was in Montreal at the time."

28:39.119 --> 28:42.653
Who'd you think your clients would be?
Grumpy and Sneezy?

28:42.915 --> 28:44.739
Huey and Bobby.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.443
I don't know. I just
didn't think they'd be...

28:47.544 --> 28:48.824
so guilty.

28:50.964 --> 28:52.279
And then?

28:52.674 --> 28:53.954
Then I left.

28:54.009 --> 28:58.159
A law school friend is at a firm
in Atlanta doing real estate law.

28:58.263 --> 28:59.708
I went to see them.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.249
The offices were very clean...

29:02.309 --> 29:04.549
and the clients were
only raping the land...

29:04.645 --> 29:07.680
and then of course
there was the money.

29:08.399 --> 29:10.591
<i>El greedo strikes again.</i>

29:10.609 --> 29:12.090
Sarah has that robe.

29:12.361 --> 29:14.221
Not this weekend she doesn't.

29:14.279 --> 29:16.472
I always jump her
when she wears it.

29:16.532 --> 29:18.890
Harold, don't you
have any other music?

29:18.951 --> 29:20.147
Like, from this century?

29:20.202 --> 29:22.193
There is no other
music in my house.

29:22.246 --> 29:25.731
There's been a lot of terrific
music in the last 10 years.

29:25.791 --> 29:26.940
Like what?

29:27.000 --> 29:31.447
How about you, Michael?
Tell us about bigtime journalism.

29:32.464 --> 29:35.155
Where I work we have
only one editorial rule:

29:35.217 --> 29:39.284
No writing longer than an average
person can read during an average crap.

29:40.931 --> 29:43.088
I'm tired of having my
work read in the can.

29:43.142 --> 29:45.215
People read Dostoyevsky in the can.

29:45.269 --> 29:47.046
But they can't finish it.

29:48.897 --> 29:51.671
This certainly is a familiar scene.

29:53.277 --> 29:56.050
I'm feeling very guilty about it.

29:56.321 --> 29:59.309
I'm happy to be here, but
I'm sick about the reason.

30:00.117 --> 30:01.692
I'm going to bed.

30:02.494 --> 30:04.454
I'm sorry. We could talk
about something else.

30:04.455 --> 30:07.525
That's okay. I'm exhausted.
Good night, everyone.

30:07.624 --> 30:09.153
I'll be up in a minute.

30:09.209 --> 30:10.868
Good night, Sarah.

30:12.337 --> 30:13.652
Harold, I'm sorry.

30:15.132 --> 30:16.495
We all feel that way.

30:17.593 --> 30:19.750
I forget what this is like.

30:20.345 --> 30:22.622
In L.A., I don't know who to trust.

30:22.723 --> 30:25.248
I feel like everybody
wants something from me.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.377
I know that sounds
terrible, but it's true.

30:27.436 --> 30:30.423
Tell me about it.
It's a cold world out there.

30:30.481 --> 30:33.432
Sometimes I think I'm
getting frosty myself.

30:33.776 --> 30:36.099
I don't know what
people think about me.

30:36.195 --> 30:39.846
I don't know why they like me,
or even if they do like me.

30:40.449 --> 30:42.558
You don't have that problem here.

30:45.496 --> 30:46.976
You know I don't like you.

30:48.957 --> 30:50.153
Me either.

30:50.501 --> 30:51.815
Ditto.

30:51.877 --> 30:53.619
So relax.

30:55.506 --> 30:57.330
Assholes.

31:24.159 --> 31:25.818
I was just coming down.

31:25.869 --> 31:27.184
Don't.

31:33.419 --> 31:35.327
What are we doing?

31:40.217 --> 31:44.367
I didn't get to talk to you before.
You got me stoned too quick.

31:44.471 --> 31:46.165
But I'm okay now.

31:46.265 --> 31:48.541
I'm just drunk and therefore brave.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.801
I've always been a
cowardly drunk myself.

31:52.938 --> 31:55.178
I bought the land three years ago.

31:55.232 --> 32:00.141
He and Chloe were working on it. There's
an old house they were fixing up.

32:00.529 --> 32:04.312
It's really pretty. I can take you
out there tomorrow if you want.

32:06.618 --> 32:09.274
That's what I don't get. It's
one of the things I don't get.

32:09.329 --> 32:11.771
He was really involved in that.

32:11.832 --> 32:14.108
It seemed to really
mean something to him.

32:14.168 --> 32:18.496
I went with him three weeks
ago to buy a table saw.

32:19.423 --> 32:21.580
Why does he do a thing like that?

32:22.760 --> 32:24.537
I should've known.

32:26.930 --> 32:29.503
- How could you know?
- Nobody knew.

32:29.725 --> 32:31.046
I can't even believe it now.

32:31.101 --> 32:33.508
I don't care. I should've known.

32:34.772 --> 32:37.297
All I want is a little warmth.

32:43.739 --> 32:44.970
What?

32:49.953 --> 32:51.648
Sweetheart?

33:00.547 --> 33:02.705
Did I ever tell you...

33:03.217 --> 33:05.623
what happened to me in Vietnam?

33:17.898 --> 33:20.719
It's a fucking bat, and I
think it touched my hair!

33:20.818 --> 33:23.094
I hate them! They're
like rats with wings.

33:23.153 --> 33:24.729
No, pigeons are rats with wings.

33:24.780 --> 33:28.313
- They're harmless. They eat mosquitoes.
- I'm going to wash my hair and puke.

33:28.367 --> 33:30.939
- Puke first, of course.
- Stand aside!

33:33.997 --> 33:36.273
That's cashmere! Give me that.

33:40.796 --> 33:42.490
I'll be right bat.

33:47.344 --> 33:48.789
Where'd it go?

33:51.598 --> 33:52.961
Listen for it.

33:53.517 --> 33:55.875
It makes weird sound. Kind of:

34:00.649 --> 34:02.391
It's quiet in here.

34:04.236 --> 34:05.895
It's too quiet.

34:10.576 --> 34:11.806
Shit!

34:12.161 --> 34:13.391
Look out, Nick!

34:14.830 --> 34:17.188
Behind you. Here, let me open this.

34:17.248 --> 34:18.563
Maybe it'll split.

34:21.128 --> 34:22.572
All right!

34:24.005 --> 34:26.531
Okay, now we got a fair fight.

34:49.572 --> 34:52.560
<i>Keep your mouth shut.
I'll do the talking.</i>

34:52.618 --> 34:54.690
<i>You can't go in there.</i>

34:55.788 --> 34:58.657
<i>I told you never to walk
in here without knocking.</i>

34:58.707 --> 35:00.070
What's this?

35:00.125 --> 35:01.356
I'm not sure.

35:01.460 --> 35:02.823
What's it about?

35:02.836 --> 35:04.495
I don't know.

35:10.844 --> 35:12.207
Who's that?

35:12.721 --> 35:15.875
I think the guy in the hat
did something terrible.

35:18.477 --> 35:21.168
<i>- Who wants to be next?
- Like what?</i>

35:21.772 --> 35:23.881
You're so analytical.

35:24.608 --> 35:27.014
Sometimes you just
have to let art...

35:27.277 --> 35:28.853
flow over you.

35:31.407 --> 35:34.358
I'm hungry. I had this
really dirty dream.

35:34.451 --> 35:36.276
Was it about Karen?

35:36.328 --> 35:39.695
- Why do you say that?
- Why should anything have changed?

35:40.290 --> 35:42.115
You're the one she always wanted.

35:43.585 --> 35:46.359
In the old days, I wasn't emotionally
equipped to satisfy her.

35:46.422 --> 35:48.947
Now the equipment
doesn't work at all.

35:50.592 --> 35:53.081
Why do we have to talk about that?

35:54.513 --> 35:56.622
Come on in the kitchen with me.

36:02.354 --> 36:05.389
I think she found what she
was looking for in Richard.

36:06.734 --> 36:09.341
Be careful what you
want, young lady...

36:09.778 --> 36:12.101
or you will surely get it.

36:19.038 --> 36:21.029
What're you doing up?
Why didn't you come in?

36:21.081 --> 36:22.721
I didn't realize
anybody else was up.

36:24.877 --> 36:27.069
I've been thinking about
your friend Alex.

36:27.171 --> 36:29.162
Did you ever meet him?

36:29.339 --> 36:32.908
Karen's told me some.
I'm imagining mostly.

36:33.469 --> 36:36.670
I never sleep through the night.
Insomnia. Karen doesn't know.

36:36.722 --> 36:39.792
I might have something
that can help.

36:40.934 --> 36:42.332
No, thanks.

36:42.811 --> 36:44.256
I don't mind it.

36:44.313 --> 36:49.590
Sometimes when my family's asleep,
I sit downstairs and it's so quiet.

36:49.693 --> 36:53.476
I hate not being able to sleep,
but I don't mind the time alone.

36:54.239 --> 36:59.351
Sometimes I think the thing about
kids is their instant priorities.

36:59.411 --> 37:02.529
You know you must protect
and provide for them...

37:02.623 --> 37:07.117
and sometimes it means your life
isn't exactly how you want it to be.

37:09.088 --> 37:10.830
There's some...

37:10.881 --> 37:13.999
asshole at work you
have to kowtow to...

37:14.093 --> 37:18.586
and sometimes you do things
you never thought you'd do.

37:18.806 --> 37:21.627
But you try to
minimize that stuff...

37:21.683 --> 37:24.209
and be the best person you can be.

37:26.105 --> 37:30.468
But you set your priorities.
And that's the way life is.

37:30.859 --> 37:33.385
I wonder if your
friend Alex knew that.

37:34.321 --> 37:37.557
One thing's for sure:
he couldn't live with it.

37:40.577 --> 37:44.028
I know I shouldn't talk.
You guys knew him.

37:44.623 --> 37:46.483
But the thing is...

37:47.042 --> 37:50.077
nobody said it was going to be fun.

37:51.547 --> 37:53.823
At least nobody said it to me.

38:08.147 --> 38:11.550
You can't run in those shoes.
I'll get you some good shoes.

38:14.862 --> 38:18.846
I'm about to tell you something
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.192
Then maybe you shouldn't.

38:22.369 --> 38:24.361
I already told Alex.

38:24.455 --> 38:26.564
Look what happened to him.

38:33.088 --> 38:36.325
In a few months, a very
large corporation...

38:36.383 --> 38:40.533
a conglomerate, is going to
buy my very small company.

38:40.637 --> 38:44.705
Anyone who has our stock
will triple their money.

38:46.977 --> 38:50.131
That's how Alex could
afford to buy the land.

38:51.982 --> 38:55.100
I was thinking you could
use the information...

38:55.152 --> 38:57.428
to get into another line of work.

38:58.530 --> 39:01.019
You never learn, do you?

39:02.284 --> 39:05.485
By telling you, I've violated
about 16 regulations...

39:05.496 --> 39:07.819
of the Securities
Exchange Commission.

39:07.873 --> 39:09.982
So please don't repeat it.

39:10.042 --> 39:11.617
Repeat what?

39:19.218 --> 39:21.042
I loved Alex.

39:23.722 --> 39:26.211
What happened between
him and Sarah...

39:26.266 --> 39:28.506
hurt, I can't deny that.

39:29.019 --> 39:31.212
But that was five years ago.

39:32.022 --> 39:33.551
We all got over it.

39:36.193 --> 39:38.718
I think they felt as bad as I did.

39:42.366 --> 39:43.941
You know...

39:45.703 --> 39:48.738
they only slept
together a few times.

39:51.125 --> 39:55.192
But in a way, their affair had
been going on since Ann Arbor.

39:56.547 --> 39:58.786
She didn't marry Alex.

40:05.973 --> 40:07.501
You'll explain everything?

40:07.599 --> 40:09.175
I'll explain to them.

40:09.393 --> 40:11.253
Have a safe trip.

40:29.288 --> 40:33.355
That's the trouble with these. You
must watch them every minute.

40:39.923 --> 40:41.915
Did I miss Karen and Richard?

40:41.967 --> 40:43.365
Nope.

40:43.469 --> 40:46.290
Just Richard. Karen's
staying the weekend.

40:46.388 --> 40:47.619
But not Richard?

40:47.681 --> 40:50.040
Went back to be with the kids.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.170
That's interesting.

40:53.896 --> 40:56.088
How did Richard feel about it?

40:56.607 --> 41:00.674
If you sleep this late, you'll
miss a few mini-dramas.

41:00.778 --> 41:04.014
I just hope you'll wake
me for anything ugly.

41:06.867 --> 41:10.518
How do actors learn all those lines?
How do you remember them?

41:10.579 --> 41:13.946
My wife used to run them with
me, but now my maid does.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.648
- Your maid?
- That's how she learned English.

41:16.710 --> 41:20.326
Sarah says to make three
of those milks nonfat.

41:20.422 --> 41:21.998
Sure you don't mind this?

41:22.049 --> 41:24.918
I'll never remember that. Will you?

41:25.094 --> 41:26.574
I don't know.

41:27.429 --> 41:30.120
If we'd gotten married,
we'd go shopping like this.

41:30.307 --> 41:34.090
No, if we'd gotten married,
I'd be doing this alone.

41:36.897 --> 41:40.964
No, I did not say that, Molly.
I said we'll see.

41:42.736 --> 41:45.558
I don't have to explain
it, young lady.

41:47.032 --> 41:51.182
I want you to do it because
I said so. Understand?

41:55.124 --> 41:57.862
When you're a mother
you can be mean.

42:00.671 --> 42:04.406
All right, you can do that.
Tell Carmelina I said it's okay.

42:04.591 --> 42:07.876
I love you, sweetheart.
Daddy will call you later.

42:09.138 --> 42:12.255
Sometimes I don't believe
what I hear myself saying.

42:26.739 --> 42:30.058
<i>So you came back from Vietnam...</i>

42:30.159 --> 42:32.684
<i>a changed man.</i>

42:33.120 --> 42:36.237
<i>Well, why don't you
just tell everybody?</i>

42:36.415 --> 42:38.489
<i>Then, in 1972...</i>

42:38.542 --> 42:40.900
<i>you returned to the
University of Michigan...</i>

42:40.919 --> 42:43.195
<i>to enter the doctoral
program in psychology.</i>

42:43.255 --> 42:47.287
<i>But you couldn't seem to
finish that dissertation.</i>

42:47.384 --> 42:52.045
<i>I could have. I chose not to.</i>

42:52.097 --> 42:55.382
<i>I'm not hung up on
this completion thing.</i>

42:55.434 --> 42:58.386
<i>Then you had many jobs,
all of which you quit.</i>

42:58.437 --> 43:02.220
<i>What are you getting at?
I was evolving.</i>

43:02.274 --> 43:04.597
I'm still evolving.

43:05.736 --> 43:09.020
But your real fame came as
a radio psychologist...

43:09.073 --> 43:11.479
on KSFO in San Francisco.

43:12.076 --> 43:15.858
I wouldn't call it fame exactly.
I had a small...

43:15.996 --> 43:18.319
deeply disturbed following.

43:19.375 --> 43:21.033
What are you doing...

43:21.877 --> 43:23.026
now?

43:23.087 --> 43:27.367
Or I should say, what have
you evolved into now?

43:29.968 --> 43:32.126
Oh, I'm in sales.

43:32.304 --> 43:34.331
What are you selling?

43:36.058 --> 43:38.049
I don't have to answer that.

43:39.311 --> 43:40.922
We're leaving. Have you seen Chloe?

43:40.979 --> 43:43.172
We're on the air here.

43:44.650 --> 43:45.881
Sorry.

43:47.486 --> 43:49.180
Sorry, pal. Got to go.

43:49.238 --> 43:50.980
Just answer that last question.

43:50.989 --> 43:53.396
I said, "I've got to go."

44:06.714 --> 44:08.214
So what happened to your partner?

44:08.215 --> 44:10.704
He wasn't my partner.
He had the idea for the club.

44:10.801 --> 44:13.788
He's out of it now.
We weren't conducive.

44:13.846 --> 44:17.379
We got together and hypered
each other into a frenzy.

44:17.808 --> 44:20.499
His wife left for a younger
woman, he couldn't make love.

44:20.561 --> 44:23.845
He was hospitalized for
being such a nerd.

44:25.399 --> 44:27.141
So he's out of it?

44:27.192 --> 44:30.642
Yeah, he's out. It's just
me, looking for investors.

44:30.696 --> 44:35.724
Alex and I made love the night
before he died. It was fantastic.

44:38.537 --> 44:41.773
He went out with a
bang, not a whimper.

44:45.002 --> 44:47.278
They're either married or gay.

44:47.337 --> 44:50.906
If they're not gay, they've broken
up with the most wonderful woman...

44:50.966 --> 44:54.701
or they've broken up with
a bitch who looks like me.

44:55.137 --> 44:59.500
They're in transition from a monogamous
relationship and need space.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.836
Or they're tired of
space, but can't commit.

45:02.936 --> 45:05.544
Or they want to commit but
are afraid to get close.

45:05.647 --> 45:08.884
They want to get close and
you don't want them near.

45:08.984 --> 45:10.762
Can't be that bad.

45:10.861 --> 45:12.306
You don't know.

45:12.696 --> 45:15.814
I've been out there
dating for 20 years.

45:15.866 --> 45:19.684
I know in the first 15 seconds
if there's a chance in the world.

45:19.745 --> 45:21.819
At least you're giving
them a fair shot.

45:21.872 --> 45:25.488
Easy for you to say. Married
to Harold, the perfect man.

45:26.210 --> 45:29.743
Sometimes I think I don't
want a man anymore.

45:29.797 --> 45:32.914
So here I sit on my
ticking biological clock.

45:32.966 --> 45:38.291
The only thing I've known my entire
life is that I want to have a child.

45:39.181 --> 45:42.964
Don't remind me. It was the
right thing to do at the time.

45:43.102 --> 45:45.175
So what do you do?

45:48.899 --> 45:50.593
I'm going to have a baby.

45:52.486 --> 45:53.717
What?

46:09.420 --> 46:12.490
She was young when
Robin and I divorced.

46:13.757 --> 46:16.033
Now she has a new father.

46:18.637 --> 46:22.288
Sometimes I think it's confusing
to her when I'm around.

46:22.516 --> 46:24.175
I don't know.

46:31.066 --> 46:33.757
- I don't need it.
- God knows I don't.

46:38.449 --> 46:42.100
- We should think of the others.
- Don't want to be selfish.

46:43.037 --> 46:47.697
I know Sarah and Meg would want
some of this Fudge Royale.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.408
They have no self-control.

46:49.501 --> 46:51.908
And the Cherry Nugget too, I think.

46:58.677 --> 47:00.455
I don't know.

47:00.929 --> 47:03.371
Maybe I don't want to
give her the time.

47:04.266 --> 47:06.922
Could I be that big an asshole?

47:08.896 --> 47:12.547
That's what's great about the
outdoors: It's one giant toilet.

47:12.649 --> 47:15.685
Maybe you should put a spot
like this in your club.

47:15.778 --> 47:17.970
It will be big. You should
take it more seriously.

47:18.030 --> 47:20.269
You'd have your own table
waiting at all times.

47:20.365 --> 47:24.646
I'm considering it. I've
always wanted my own table.

47:25.079 --> 47:27.770
Now, I'd have a chair too, right?

47:30.459 --> 47:34.028
Remember senior year we were all going
to buy that land near Saginaw?

47:34.088 --> 47:35.912
What happened with that?

47:36.006 --> 47:37.998
We didn't have any money.

47:39.551 --> 47:41.958
That's when property was a crime.

47:44.056 --> 47:46.545
You know, it's raining.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.425
It's nice, isn't it?

47:48.894 --> 47:50.292
Nice.

47:50.729 --> 47:53.005
You're not afraid
of snakes, are you?

47:54.525 --> 47:56.551
You're a doctor. Doctors
know everything.

47:56.610 --> 47:58.637
Be supportive for a
minute and shut up.

47:58.737 --> 48:02.805
I've been taking my temperature
and I know I'm ovulating.

48:02.866 --> 48:05.818
The ground is ready. I need
someone to plant the seed.

48:05.911 --> 48:08.567
Who's going to be the lucky farmer?

48:08.872 --> 48:12.904
These are the best guys I know.
My favourite men in the world.

48:13.001 --> 48:16.985
Unfortunately, I found out
Nick is no longer a candidate.

48:17.256 --> 48:21.038
Michael's a possibility, but I
think as a fallback position.

48:21.135 --> 48:22.497
So to speak.

48:22.594 --> 48:24.372
So that leaves Sam.

48:24.471 --> 48:28.005
- Harold's not good enough for you?
- Are you kidding? I'd love it.

48:28.058 --> 48:29.918
But I couldn't ask that of you.

48:30.018 --> 48:31.962
Anyway, Harold's got enough kids.

48:32.020 --> 48:35.174
That's very considerate.
Too bad Richard left.

48:37.735 --> 48:42.395
Have you and Sam discussed it, or
are you planning a surprise attack?

48:42.448 --> 48:44.391
Why should he have
a problem with it?

48:44.450 --> 48:47.604
There won't be obligations.
I love him as a friend.

48:47.661 --> 48:50.732
I assume he loves me.
He'd do anything for me.

48:50.831 --> 48:54.281
Somehow I feel it isn't
quite this simple.

48:54.418 --> 48:57.323
For one thing, it doesn't
always happen the first time.

48:57.421 --> 49:00.373
That's not what they
told us in high school.

49:00.674 --> 49:04.658
This is great. This
is really great.

49:13.729 --> 49:15.803
Alex loved this place.

49:17.816 --> 49:21.468
I can understand it. It's terrific.

49:32.498 --> 49:34.322
You remind me of Alex.

49:42.591 --> 49:44.166
I ain't him.

49:45.177 --> 49:47.286
<i>Nobody thinks they're a bad person.</i>

49:47.388 --> 49:50.209
<i>I don't claim people think
they do the right thing.</i>

49:50.265 --> 49:53.716
<i>They may know they do dishonest
or manipulative things...</i>

49:53.769 --> 49:55.796
<i>but think there's a
good reason for it.</i>

49:56.355 --> 49:59.010
<i>They think it'll turn
out for the best.</i>

49:59.066 --> 50:03.133
<i>If it turns out best for them,
it is by definition what's best.</i>

50:03.237 --> 50:06.106
<i>You also come up against
a question of style.</i>

50:06.490 --> 50:09.263
<i>My style may be too direct.</i>

50:09.368 --> 50:12.522
<i>Perhaps given my style
I seem more nakedly...</i>

50:12.579 --> 50:15.449
<i>opportunistic or jerky or...</i>

50:16.291 --> 50:17.820
<i>What was the other thing?</i>

50:17.876 --> 50:19.405
<i>- Manipulative?
- Whatever.</i>

50:19.461 --> 50:22.117
<i>All that's happening is I'm
trying to get what I want.</i>

50:22.172 --> 50:25.207
<i>Which is what we all do, but
their styles are so warm...</i>

50:25.259 --> 50:28.792
<i>you don't realize they're
trying to get what they want.</i>

50:28.887 --> 50:32.207
<i>So my transparent efforts are
more honest and admirable.</i>

50:32.307 --> 50:35.544
<i>Why does this sound like a
massive rationalization?</i>

50:35.644 --> 50:38.335
<i>Don't knock rationalization.
Where would we be without it?</i>

50:38.397 --> 50:41.717
<i>I don't know anyone who can go a day
without 2 or 3 rationalizations.</i>

50:41.817 --> 50:43.345
<i>They're more important than sex.</i>

50:43.402 --> 50:45.559
<i>Nothing's more important than sex!</i>

50:45.654 --> 50:48.392
<i>Ever gone a week without
a rationalization?</i>

50:49.742 --> 50:51.187
What's your shoe size?

50:51.285 --> 50:53.193
Six and a half.

50:54.329 --> 50:57.151
Still the best way to
determine if it's ready.

50:57.666 --> 50:59.834
- Meg, what's your shoe size?
- Who wants to know?

50:59.835 --> 51:01.066
What, it's about a six and a half?

51:01.128 --> 51:03.404
It used to be, but now it's seven.

51:03.505 --> 51:05.965
- Your feet grow as you get older.
- I wish everything did.

51:05.966 --> 51:08.408
How much longer?
Everything's getting cold.

51:08.510 --> 51:11.497
After 12 years you haven't
learned to make anything else?

51:11.555 --> 51:14.044
- I've improved on it.
- Now it's edible?

51:14.141 --> 51:17.792
- The meal is ready. Let's go.
- J.T. Lancer!

51:17.853 --> 51:21.054
Let's go watch this
incredible show!

51:21.106 --> 51:22.587
Oh, my God!

51:23.817 --> 51:25.725
Come on, Sam.

51:26.945 --> 51:28.604
Jesus.

51:31.366 --> 51:34.437
Look at that hunk of man, kids.

51:34.912 --> 51:36.939
He's so handsome.

51:36.997 --> 51:38.442
Jesus!

51:40.542 --> 51:41.822
Look out!

51:42.503 --> 51:44.161
You forgot your Dramamine.

51:46.256 --> 51:48.366
- Turn that off.
- No, it's great!

51:48.425 --> 51:50.084
Does the suit come
with the machete?

51:50.094 --> 51:52.002
You're dashing. Dashing!

51:52.513 --> 51:54.705
Why are you doing this to me?

51:54.723 --> 51:56.299
You look great!

51:57.601 --> 51:59.082
There she is.

51:59.186 --> 52:01.842
I interviewed this girl.

52:01.897 --> 52:03.840
Where is this?
I'm going to Hollywood.

52:04.358 --> 52:06.467
"I want a Margarita now!"

52:10.197 --> 52:12.639
Kids, don't try that at home.
That's a warning.

52:12.783 --> 52:14.774
Watch out for that stick shift!

52:15.744 --> 52:17.853
- Two at once?
- He's done a lot of pec work.

52:18.163 --> 52:20.155
My favourite part!

52:21.625 --> 52:23.070
Here it is.

52:27.381 --> 52:29.953
- Say, baby, let's eat.
- Come on, big guy!

52:30.008 --> 52:33.328
- The pasta's ruined now.
- You get money when that airs?

52:33.721 --> 52:38.084
One thing I do want is a Cosmic
Invaders game for my trailer...

52:38.142 --> 52:40.059
so Nick and I can
watch it and kick back.

52:40.060 --> 52:42.467
- What? I don't want to hear this.
- What do you mean?

52:42.521 --> 52:45.675
Video games? You relax
with video games?

52:46.358 --> 52:48.515
Don't knock video games.

52:48.819 --> 52:54.014
I let you guys out of sight and
you develop moronic interests.

52:54.116 --> 52:55.514
Don't knock morons.

52:57.369 --> 53:00.191
Would you prefer we
got into heavy drugs?

53:00.289 --> 53:01.520
That might be better.

53:01.623 --> 53:03.531
No offense, Nick.

53:05.252 --> 53:07.492
He should be here.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.034
I feel like we should've
had a chair for Alex.

53:12.051 --> 53:15.002
Of course, we don't
have enough food.

53:16.263 --> 53:18.337
This is all so familiar.

53:18.432 --> 53:21.835
I love you all so much. That
sounds gross, doesn't it?

53:21.894 --> 53:23.967
No, it doesn't.

53:24.563 --> 53:28.346
I feel I was at my best
when I was with you people.

53:33.155 --> 53:35.015
I know what you mean.

53:36.617 --> 53:39.818
When I lost touch
with this group...

53:40.120 --> 53:42.527
I lost my idea of what I should be.

53:43.874 --> 53:46.446
Maybe that's what happened to Alex.

53:46.502 --> 53:49.406
We expected something of each
other then. We needed that.

53:49.463 --> 53:50.742
Not me.

53:50.839 --> 53:53.791
Getting away from you people was the
best thing to ever happen to me.

53:53.842 --> 53:57.957
I mean, how much sex, fun,
friendship can one man take?

53:58.013 --> 54:00.122
Had to get out in the
world, get dirty.

54:00.224 --> 54:01.834
No, I think Sam is right.

54:01.892 --> 54:04.001
There was something in me then...

54:04.103 --> 54:06.623
that made me want to go to
Harlem and teach ghetto kids.

54:06.688 --> 54:10.589
I was going to help the scum, as I
so compassionately call them now.

54:10.901 --> 54:12.299
Some of them are scum.

54:12.361 --> 54:14.435
Some of us are scum.

54:14.863 --> 54:19.441
So what's the thrust here?
We were great then and we're shit now?

54:19.660 --> 54:21.188
I don't buy that.

54:21.245 --> 54:23.852
That's not what we're saying.

54:24.456 --> 54:25.901
I don't know.

54:26.417 --> 54:28.775
I'd hate to think
it was all just...

54:28.836 --> 54:30.281
fashion.

54:31.130 --> 54:32.361
What?

54:32.423 --> 54:33.821
Our commitment.

54:33.924 --> 54:36.117
It wasn't. We accomplished things.

54:36.218 --> 54:39.419
- All evidence to the contrary.
- You're just taking a position.

54:39.471 --> 54:42.672
Sometimes I think I've
put that time down...

54:42.683 --> 54:45.456
just so I can live
with how I am now.

54:46.145 --> 54:48.586
Help me with these bleeding hearts.

54:49.064 --> 54:51.091
I know what Alex would say.

54:51.150 --> 54:52.595
What?

54:54.236 --> 54:55.895
What's for dessert?

55:07.124 --> 55:09.363
I'm not cynical about dessert.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.837
- Want to load the dishwasher?
- I'd be thrilled.

56:30.207 --> 56:32.863
I think I've just been
too slow to realize...

56:32.918 --> 56:35.787
that people our age with
histories like ours...

56:35.838 --> 56:38.410
having gone through
the same stuff...

56:38.507 --> 56:42.491
could be dishonest, unprincipled,
backstabbing sleazeballs.

56:42.594 --> 56:44.668
Could have told you
that a long time ago.

56:44.722 --> 56:48.789
I was prejudiced in their favour.
I thought because they look like us...

56:48.851 --> 56:51.506
and talked like us
they would think like us.

56:54.648 --> 56:59.177
I know that Richard will
always be faithful to me.

56:59.987 --> 57:01.895
That's nice.

57:02.030 --> 57:03.974
A little trust.

57:04.575 --> 57:06.483
Fear of herpes.

57:15.753 --> 57:17.744
It's not right.

57:19.089 --> 57:21.163
Alex is still warm.

57:21.925 --> 57:23.999
Can't blame Chloe. She's a kid.

57:24.094 --> 57:26.702
Michael hasn't changed.

57:27.848 --> 57:29.211
Wait.

57:29.266 --> 57:30.497
What?

57:32.770 --> 57:35.461
Ever meet Michael's
girlfriend, Annie?

57:35.564 --> 57:37.306
She's great.

57:37.357 --> 57:41.721
She teaches the fourth grade.
Still teaching in Harlem.

57:43.572 --> 57:45.266
It's not right.

57:49.036 --> 57:51.110
I can't keep my eyes open.

57:51.163 --> 57:53.569
I don't want to go
to bed, but I must.

57:53.624 --> 57:55.448
- You really don't want to?
- I must.

57:55.501 --> 57:57.159
But you don't...

57:58.587 --> 58:00.281
want to?

58:02.466 --> 58:04.457
Come with me.

58:11.350 --> 58:12.581
What?

58:14.144 --> 58:15.922
You want me to what?

58:17.523 --> 58:20.724
Come on, Sam. Don't
make me say it again.

58:39.044 --> 58:41.735
You've given me a massive headache.

58:42.589 --> 58:45.743
You're not going to use
that old excuse, are you?

58:46.927 --> 58:48.954
You've got good genes.

58:59.064 --> 59:00.842
Where'd Chloe go?

59:00.899 --> 59:03.057
She's coming right back.

59:04.445 --> 59:06.684
No, I'm not in the mood.

59:06.780 --> 59:09.103
Wait a minute. What
is that, a lude?

59:09.158 --> 59:10.768
You want it?

59:13.579 --> 59:15.356
Do you take a half?

59:15.456 --> 59:17.648
Full stomach, I'd take a whole.

59:17.708 --> 59:19.735
Right, I'm sure you would.

59:21.920 --> 59:24.113
<i>What the hell. L'Chaim!</i>

59:36.393 --> 59:39.547
There's a shift in your
perceptions of the world.

59:39.605 --> 59:42.889
Forever you're responsible
for another living thing.

59:45.319 --> 59:47.262
It's wonderful.

59:47.362 --> 59:49.769
But it's a huge commitment.

59:50.574 --> 59:52.352
A commitment that has
nothing to do...

59:52.368 --> 59:55.983
with legal names and
legal obligations.

59:58.957 --> 01:00:00.865
I'm sorry, Meg.

01:00:01.043 --> 01:00:03.948
I'd love to help you but I can't.

01:00:04.004 --> 01:00:05.829
You know, you're something.

01:00:05.923 --> 01:00:07.914
I love you.

01:00:08.008 --> 01:00:10.782
- Really, I can't.
- I accept that!

01:00:10.844 --> 01:00:14.994
I mean, I really love you.
You're a nice person.

01:00:17.393 --> 01:00:18.755
Really?

01:00:24.817 --> 01:00:26.677
So you want to fuck?

01:00:27.653 --> 01:00:29.395
Just kidding!

01:00:36.912 --> 01:00:38.986
Then one day I was driving home.

01:00:39.081 --> 01:00:42.151
They were running a tape
of one of my shows.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:45.612
I heard myself talking to
someone who had called up.

01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:48.623
Someone in real pain.

01:00:48.841 --> 01:00:52.955
I listened for about 45 seconds.
And I'm talking...

01:00:53.053 --> 01:00:56.254
like I know them and understand...

01:00:56.306 --> 01:01:00.967
and have something useful
to say about their lives.

01:01:02.563 --> 01:01:04.720
The worst part was
they believed me.

01:01:04.815 --> 01:01:06.806
I quit the next day.

01:01:16.618 --> 01:01:18.194
You helped me.

01:01:20.914 --> 01:01:24.199
I was 15 and my family
was living in Oakland.

01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:27.571
And I used to listen
to you every night.

01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:30.698
One night I called you up.

01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:34.246
I was upset and thought
something was wrong with me.

01:01:34.344 --> 01:01:37.166
- Like I was a pervert.
- What did I say?

01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:40.165
That I'd be okay if I
did my homework...

01:01:40.225 --> 01:01:42.798
and went to bed at
a reasonable hour.

01:01:44.897 --> 01:01:47.635
You were right. It was okay.

01:01:47.816 --> 01:01:49.095
You helped.

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:53.012
I don't want to discuss this now.

01:01:53.072 --> 01:01:56.272
Why? You have more people to
tell about the stock thing?

01:01:56.325 --> 01:01:58.149
It's really a charming side of you.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.112
Remind me to get more
cocaine tomorrow.

01:02:01.163 --> 01:02:05.692
If you tell everyone about the stock
deal, it will blow up in your face.

01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.778
Who will you tell next? Michael?

01:02:07.836 --> 01:02:11.370
He came down here to find investors
for that moronic club of his.

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:14.708
- He came down for Alex's funeral.
- Maybe.

01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:19.498
You are in no condition
to discuss this now.

01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:21.880
You can't change people's lives!

01:02:21.975 --> 01:02:25.758
Who do you think you are,
John Beresford Tipton?

01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:28.097
I'm going to sleep.

01:02:30.943 --> 01:02:34.097
How can you go to sleep?
I'm not even tired.

01:03:04.184 --> 01:03:07.800
Some say suicide is the ultimate
act of self-absorption.

01:03:07.855 --> 01:03:10.806
Alex didn't commit suicide.
It was an accident.

01:03:10.899 --> 01:03:14.883
That's right, he was shaving.
Alex had hairy wrists.

01:03:16.405 --> 01:03:19.060
Masturbation's the ultimate
act of self-absorption.

01:03:19.158 --> 01:03:20.935
You jerk off?

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:23.193
Does a bear have fleas?

01:03:23.245 --> 01:03:25.603
No, does a bear shit in the woods?

01:03:25.706 --> 01:03:26.985
Does a bear jerk off?

01:03:27.082 --> 01:03:29.489
I shit in the woods,
but I can't jerk off.

01:03:29.585 --> 01:03:31.346
We're trying to avoid
dealing with Alex.

01:03:31.378 --> 01:03:33.618
Every time it comes up,
someone changes the subject.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.538
It's a dead subject.

01:03:35.591 --> 01:03:37.997
I get real tired of these jokes.

01:03:38.052 --> 01:03:40.956
What are we afraid of?
To show our emotions?

01:03:41.013 --> 01:03:43.336
Are we mad at him for
leaving no explanations?

01:03:43.432 --> 01:03:47.167
I could say something funny
about that. But I won't.

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:49.503
Great, they got here early.

01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:56.844
Thanks, Toby. I appreciate it.

01:03:56.904 --> 01:04:00.140
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper.
It was my pleasure.

01:04:02.743 --> 01:04:05.979
Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper. Sir.

01:04:06.038 --> 01:04:08.480
Give me a break, that's my name.

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:10.449
Mr. Weber.

01:05:12.521 --> 01:05:14.678
So you just fell asleep?

01:05:14.773 --> 01:05:17.180
That's what I just said, didn't I?

01:05:17.276 --> 01:05:19.385
About five times.

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:23.519
I didn't know him in the
biblical sense. Is that clear?

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:25.019
I don't know why you're touchy.

01:05:25.075 --> 01:05:27.315
I don't know why you're curious.

01:05:30.456 --> 01:05:32.150
These feel great.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:36.071
I'm never taking these off.
I will sleep in them.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.205
Which doesn't mean he'll
have sex with them.

01:05:40.215 --> 01:05:43.369
Is there any salt
and pepper, please?

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:59.220
What do you think about this
latest brainstorm of Michael's?

01:06:02.446 --> 01:06:06.311
I'm not sure I want to be part
owner of a jet-set greasy spoon.

01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:10.476
Think we could stall
him for a while?

01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:15.654
What is that?

01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:18.198
Nick wanted to take a
look at the property.

01:06:18.253 --> 01:06:21.324
He'll be back before
the game starts.

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.415
Thanks.

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.118
Are we the first ones up?

01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:10.004
You remember. Alex used
to call me Sam the Sham.

01:07:10.055 --> 01:07:11.666
Don't say that. It was real.

01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:16.336
I stood with thousands of people
listening to you. You moved them.

01:07:16.395 --> 01:07:19.264
Now I reach millions
of people every week.

01:07:19.314 --> 01:07:21.174
Hell, it's just garbage.

01:07:21.275 --> 01:07:23.681
That's not true. You
entertain people.

01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:26.184
God knows, we need that now.

01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:27.769
I try.

01:07:27.823 --> 01:07:31.724
I try once every show to put
something of value in there.

01:07:31.785 --> 01:07:33.563
- But I don't know.
- You do.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.686
I can see it.

01:07:35.664 --> 01:07:38.735
I feel my kids have gotten
something from J.T. Lancer.

01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:39.982
Really?

01:07:42.337 --> 01:07:43.700
Kids.

01:07:44.715 --> 01:07:47.038
There you go. You've
done something.

01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:50.584
You and Richard have built
something for yourselves.

01:07:52.056 --> 01:07:54.544
You know the secret of Richard?

01:07:56.727 --> 01:07:58.718
Remember my father?

01:08:00.064 --> 01:08:02.837
I didn't want that to happen to me.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.303
Richard looked like all that had
been missing in my childhood.

01:08:06.445 --> 01:08:09.848
A man like that could build a
stable environment for children.

01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:11.435
And he did.

01:08:11.658 --> 01:08:13.732
It's just that now...

01:08:19.416 --> 01:08:20.779
What?

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:23.737
Well, you know.

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:26.285
Tell me.

01:08:28.091 --> 01:08:30.830
Well, it's not like talking to you.

01:08:32.888 --> 01:08:35.412
All my life, deep inside...

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.926
I felt there was something
I wanted to express...

01:08:38.977 --> 01:08:42.296
but always felt, I
don't know, stymied.

01:08:43.774 --> 01:08:47.259
I'm proud of what I did. I'm doing
a good job of raising my sons.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:52.098
If it meant giving up my
writing, that's the way it goes.

01:08:53.783 --> 01:08:56.819
- You don't remember my writing.
- Sure I do.

01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:59.822
It's just poems and short stories.

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.359
I didn't show it to many people.

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.908
Why talk about it?
I made my decision.

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:10.038
My children come first.

01:09:10.968 --> 01:09:14.203
It's just that now it
leaves kind of a...

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.587
I don't know, a space.

01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:20.881
And all of Richard's...

01:09:20.935 --> 01:09:25.264
country clubs and home
improvements and business deals...

01:09:26.316 --> 01:09:29.006
are pretty superficial stuff.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.563
I'm not complaining.
Well, maybe I am.

01:09:33.991 --> 01:09:35.305
Sorry.

01:09:36.201 --> 01:09:37.729
It's just...

01:09:37.786 --> 01:09:39.444
being with you...

01:09:40.706 --> 01:09:42.779
opens me up somehow.

01:09:45.002 --> 01:09:46.529
Forgive me?

01:09:59.266 --> 01:10:02.301
<i>Hail to the conquering heroes.
Come on, the game's starting!</i>

01:10:02.352 --> 01:10:04.675
You don't want to
miss any of the Blue.

01:10:04.772 --> 01:10:06.549
Yes, you do, all right.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.591
<i>And you were ready to write
this one off at 10-0.</i>

01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:14.559
<i>- I didn't say anything about that.
- I saw that smile.</i>

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:17.600
That pass, I can't believe it.

01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:19.064
Go, go, go!

01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:28.447
A flag? What?

01:10:29.254 --> 01:10:31.079
What are they calling that?

01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.612
- What is that?
- Clipping.

01:10:32.716 --> 01:10:34.292
That was a clean hit.

01:10:34.343 --> 01:10:37.295
- He clipped him.
- What are you talking about?!

01:10:37.388 --> 01:10:40.542
<i>Clipping. Called against Michigan.</i>

01:10:42.851 --> 01:10:44.925
Sorry, Chloe.

01:10:45.979 --> 01:10:48.421
Come on, Blue, you're not supposed
to fold till the fourth quarter.

01:10:48.482 --> 01:10:50.888
Don't heckle Bo. He's
got enough pressure.

01:10:51.777 --> 01:10:55.144
Where is Nick? I can't
believe he's missing this.

01:10:55.739 --> 01:10:58.691
Teach them the basics, Bo.
Ugliest helmets in the world.

01:11:02.955 --> 01:11:04.946
I don't know.

01:11:05.457 --> 01:11:09.737
Sometimes I wonder if I was
sick of being a good girl.

01:11:10.045 --> 01:11:12.950
I could be counted on
to do the right thing.

01:11:13.048 --> 01:11:15.573
It's a disgusting curse.

01:11:15.676 --> 01:11:18.793
Probably thought Alex could
touch that part of me...

01:11:18.887 --> 01:11:21.839
that was unpredictable and magic.

01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:24.256
The part I was always afraid of.

01:11:24.393 --> 01:11:26.835
Who knows if it's even there?

01:11:27.896 --> 01:11:30.469
When it was over, everything
went back to how it was before.

01:11:30.566 --> 01:11:33.517
That's what we all agreed.
That's what we all said.

01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:38.515
I was sorry everyone knew, but that
was as much my fault as anything.

01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:40.393
Of course...

01:11:40.492 --> 01:11:43.100
things weren't really the same.

01:11:43.746 --> 01:11:46.234
Alex withdrew from me then.

01:11:46.665 --> 01:11:49.154
I was probably different with him.

01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:52.276
We never wanted Harold
to think that...

01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:55.326
You can imagine.

01:11:57.634 --> 01:12:02.710
So we finally consummated
this ancient lurking passion.

01:12:02.931 --> 01:12:06.465
All it had done was put up
a wall in our friendship.

01:12:11.857 --> 01:12:13.136
What?

01:12:13.192 --> 01:12:15.016
He's not passing!

01:12:17.571 --> 01:12:20.855
Nobody in the area.
Who was he passing to?

01:12:20.949 --> 01:12:23.438
I'm sure you're happy.
He threw it right to you!

01:12:23.535 --> 01:12:25.016
Idiot!

01:12:26.038 --> 01:12:30.366
They're flying up a new quarterback
from Texas or something.

01:12:32.127 --> 01:12:33.987
What? I didn't throw the ball.

01:12:34.046 --> 01:12:36.285
So what am I, chopped liver?

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.579
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

01:12:38.634 --> 01:12:40.873
- No, I don't.
- You know.

01:12:42.638 --> 01:12:44.415
You asked Sam.

01:12:44.515 --> 01:12:46.458
What is this, published somewhere?

01:12:46.517 --> 01:12:49.208
You know we can do it.
We've done it.

01:12:49.853 --> 01:12:53.257
Remember the march on Washington?
Armies of the night?

01:12:53.315 --> 01:12:55.057
I remember.

01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:57.726
I thought you'd be grateful.

01:12:57.778 --> 01:13:01.014
- You're sweeping me off my feet.
- I thought you wanted a kid.

01:13:02.199 --> 01:13:03.679
Thank you, Michael.

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:06.318
This is a big decision.

01:13:06.412 --> 01:13:09.019
I'll get back to you
in the third quarter.

01:14:05.846 --> 01:14:10.091
Look at this! This could be us!
The next generation.

01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:12.460
It could be. Think about it.

01:14:12.519 --> 01:14:13.882
Think!

01:14:32.289 --> 01:14:33.734
Shit.

01:14:40.672 --> 01:14:42.450
- How you doing, Harold?
- Not bad.

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:45.163
This guy claims to be
a guest. That true?

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.623
Depends. What'd he do?

01:14:46.678 --> 01:14:49.120
- For one, he ran a red light.
- No, I didn't.

01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:52.501
- He became verbally abusive.
- You got etiquette laws here?

01:14:52.559 --> 01:14:54.218
25 bucks he's hitting me for!

01:14:54.269 --> 01:14:59.345
He could be one of them Yankee
drug dealers we sometimes get...

01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:01.433
passing through on
their way to Florida.

01:15:01.527 --> 01:15:04.300
This is my lawyer.
I don't have to take this.

01:15:04.363 --> 01:15:06.639
It's true, officer. Do
you have probable cause?

01:15:06.865 --> 01:15:09.354
Excuse me, aren't you J.T. Lancer?

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.771
Yes, sir, Officer.

01:15:12.955 --> 01:15:16.239
I'll be. What's that
make you, Perry Mason?

01:15:17.042 --> 01:15:19.864
You know, Pete. He does
look suspicious to me too.

01:15:19.962 --> 01:15:23.079
Let's take him out back and
kick the shit out of him.

01:15:23.549 --> 01:15:26.536
Must be quick. The second
half of the game's starting.

01:15:32.683 --> 01:15:35.504
I'd be willing to drop
this whole thing...

01:15:35.602 --> 01:15:38.128
if you could persuade
Mr. Lancer into showing us...

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:41.003
how he hops into
that sports car on TV.

01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:43.760
I'd really appreciate it.

01:15:43.861 --> 01:15:46.599
I watch that show every week
and I've always wondered.

01:15:46.864 --> 01:15:50.018
Myself, I always have to
open the damn car door.

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:51.936
You have a hard top.

01:15:52.619 --> 01:15:53.982
Don't do it.

01:16:00.044 --> 01:16:01.702
Go for it.

01:16:15.059 --> 01:16:16.504
I don't believe this.

01:16:21.482 --> 01:16:23.010
Damn it!

01:16:27.029 --> 01:16:28.806
It's not that bad, guys!

01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:30.689
Don't talk. Don't try to talk.

01:16:30.783 --> 01:16:32.525
Make sure you keep his arm up.

01:16:32.576 --> 01:16:34.852
Am I going to need a tetanus shot?

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:39.531
- You won't amputate, will you?
- I got to see.

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:40.987
What about my career?

01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:44.613
I am sorry. I thought
they could do that stuff.

01:16:44.671 --> 01:16:45.903
It's not your fault.

01:16:46.715 --> 01:16:49.453
- Enjoy that second half, now.
- Will do.

01:16:52.471 --> 01:16:55.921
Since when did you get
so friendly with cops?

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:04.465
You know, you're fucking stupid.

01:17:05.776 --> 01:17:07.221
Stupid!

01:17:07.653 --> 01:17:11.352
That cop has twice kept this
house from being ripped off.

01:17:11.448 --> 01:17:13.641
Happens to be a hell of a guy.

01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:15.735
And you...

01:17:18.872 --> 01:17:20.982
Come on, what is it?

01:17:27.297 --> 01:17:29.075
What is it with you?

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.498
Is jail another experience to try?
See what it's like?

01:17:38.475 --> 01:17:40.335
You know, I live here.

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:44.921
This place means something
to me. I'm dug in.

01:17:45.441 --> 01:17:47.633
I don't need this shit.

01:17:58.954 --> 01:18:01.147
You know, I really can do it.

01:18:01.206 --> 01:18:04.407
It's these damn running shoes.
They practically kill me.

01:18:04.543 --> 01:18:06.154
We know you can.

01:18:06.587 --> 01:18:09.538
Being a private eye
is dangerous work.

01:18:11.467 --> 01:18:14.122
I got to get back
to the game, coach.

01:18:14.636 --> 01:18:16.035
Walk.

01:18:17.973 --> 01:18:20.379
We're deep in the third quarter.

01:18:21.226 --> 01:18:23.502
Just testing. A little joke.

01:18:26.523 --> 01:18:30.591
Michael has graciously agreed
to act as stud for me.

01:18:30.819 --> 01:18:32.846
A repeat performance.

01:18:32.905 --> 01:18:34.932
He didn't say that, did he?

01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:37.681
Well, it's almost that romantic.

01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:39.977
What are you going to do?

01:18:44.249 --> 01:18:48.068
I can't do it with him. Too
much history, it's not right.

01:18:48.128 --> 01:18:52.492
I can't believe this. I'm just
deciding this as we speak.

01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:56.039
It's not going to
happen this weekend.

01:18:57.304 --> 01:19:00.920
Maybe it's a sign from God
that I should reconsider.

01:19:01.058 --> 01:19:03.167
Too bad I'm an atheist.

01:19:07.523 --> 01:19:09.680
- Like what?
- Say anything.

01:19:09.942 --> 01:19:12.099
Tell us about your past.

01:19:12.236 --> 01:19:14.808
- I lived with Alex.
- Before that.

01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:16.480
Before that.

01:19:16.573 --> 01:19:17.936
Randy.

01:19:21.161 --> 01:19:25.655
I don't like talking about my
past as much as you guys do.

01:19:27.543 --> 01:19:29.534
Okay, I'll buy that.

01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:34.530
Can you tell us
something about Alex?

01:19:36.093 --> 01:19:38.001
Well, he was cute.

01:19:39.888 --> 01:19:45.046
He said we made a good couple because I
had no expectations and he had too many.

01:19:49.106 --> 01:19:51.714
<i>He believed in reincarnation.</i>

01:19:54.236 --> 01:19:56.345
<i>He never ate meat.</i>

01:19:56.405 --> 01:20:00.899
<i>He said he was afraid he would
come back someday as a steak.</i>

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:08.818
<i>He said he should have accepted
that Rutledge fellowship.</i>

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.578
<i>What's the matter, Nick?</i>

01:20:21.805 --> 01:20:24.675
Two, three, four.

01:20:45.287 --> 01:20:50.612
The biggest mistake I made was not
trying harder to steal you from Nick.

01:20:50.834 --> 01:20:53.442
You know I always
wanted you to try.

01:20:55.923 --> 01:20:57.617
I never got that feeling.

01:20:57.716 --> 01:21:00.123
I guess you weren't
paying attention.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.418
It's a little late now, isn't it?

01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:08.088
Is it?

01:21:09.895 --> 01:21:11.554
What are you saying?

01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:12.920
I think you know.

01:21:13.524 --> 01:21:15.965
I think you've known
this whole weekend.

01:21:16.235 --> 01:21:18.427
Wait, you mean you and Richard...?

01:21:18.612 --> 01:21:21.599
See? You've always
been able to read me.

01:21:21.782 --> 01:21:24.473
You know my life with
Richard isn't working.

01:21:25.077 --> 01:21:28.064
Well, I knew you two
weren't exactly...

01:21:28.122 --> 01:21:29.484
But I didn't think-

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.364
I'm going to leave him.

01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:34.739
Let's get the Wonton
Express rolling.

01:21:35.295 --> 01:21:37.155
You want to come along?

01:21:37.214 --> 01:21:38.908
No, you go ahead.

01:21:40.884 --> 01:21:42.662
I'll be right here.

01:21:44.513 --> 01:21:46.836
Just climb in there regular, okay?

01:22:07.286 --> 01:22:09.028
Listen to those guys.

01:22:09.079 --> 01:22:10.655
Goddamn!

01:22:11.957 --> 01:22:14.565
Remember the night
we saw them in Cobo?

01:22:16.795 --> 01:22:18.537
No, you probably don't.

01:22:18.922 --> 01:22:21.660
You were hallucinating
pretty bad that night.

01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:27.710
We didn't even have any drugs.

01:22:28.515 --> 01:22:32.499
Have you noticed anything
unusual about this weekend?

01:22:32.644 --> 01:22:34.588
Other than Alex dying?

01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:38.138
I've been getting some
pretty weird propositions.

01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:42.722
I don't think I could live
down here all the time.

01:22:45.741 --> 01:22:48.858
Last year I went to Hawaii
with my friend Reena.

01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:53.025
We ate at a Chinese restaurant.
When they brought the fortune cookies...

01:22:53.082 --> 01:22:55.191
hers said, "You'll never
amount to anything."

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.909
I don't believe it.

01:23:02.132 --> 01:23:04.574
"Friendship is the
bread of life..."

01:23:04.635 --> 01:23:06.792
Wait a minute!
"...but money is the honey."

01:23:06.929 --> 01:23:08.540
It doesn't say that.

01:23:08.597 --> 01:23:10.671
- You're kidding.
- That's great!

01:23:10.766 --> 01:23:13.539
Even fortune cookies
are getting cynical!

01:23:13.602 --> 01:23:15.047
Cynical? It's pragmatic.

01:23:15.104 --> 01:23:17.343
I think it's touching.

01:24:00.983 --> 01:24:04.516
There's nothing I'd rather do
right now than make love to you.

01:24:08.574 --> 01:24:10.149
When it's over...

01:24:10.242 --> 01:24:12.233
come into my life.

01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:16.818
You and your kids come out
to L.A., move into my house.

01:24:17.124 --> 01:24:20.989
There's plenty of room.
It's lovely, it's great.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.538
I can't do that.

01:24:26.425 --> 01:24:28.701
It has to do with Robin.

01:24:29.011 --> 01:24:33.078
No, it's not that. My
marriage is completely over.

01:24:33.432 --> 01:24:37.843
When Robin and I broke up,
I had a million good reasons.

01:24:37.895 --> 01:24:41.962
A million things that were
wrong with her, wrong with us.

01:24:42.357 --> 01:24:44.764
When I think back on it now...

01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:49.562
and see my daughter with her new
father, I realize what broke us up.

01:24:49.656 --> 01:24:52.976
What really did it, and I
hate to admit it, even now.

01:24:53.786 --> 01:24:56.025
What did it was...

01:24:58.123 --> 01:24:59.568
boredom.

01:25:00.209 --> 01:25:02.318
I couldn't stick with it.

01:25:05.631 --> 01:25:08.536
I'd hate to see you
make that same mistake.

01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:14.376
You're a much better
person than that.

01:25:15.599 --> 01:25:17.922
Don't give me that shit!

01:25:18.143 --> 01:25:21.261
For 15 years, you've acted like
I'm the one you really wanted.

01:25:21.313 --> 01:25:23.221
You made sure everyone knew.

01:25:23.273 --> 01:25:25.632
And now I come down here-

01:25:36.036 --> 01:25:38.145
Don't be mad at him, honey.

01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:42.401
Well, it's called an anus.

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:47.538
I'm sure it is boring to hear it
20 times, but just ignore him.

01:25:48.048 --> 01:25:49.624
All right.

01:25:50.342 --> 01:25:52.334
Yes. Just a minute.

01:25:52.386 --> 01:25:53.997
She's right here.

01:25:54.638 --> 01:25:56.297
No, just hold on.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:03.386
Hello, muffin. How are you?

01:26:03.731 --> 01:26:06.137
You got it? Great!

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:07.720
You did?

01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:13.101
When I saw it, I said I have one friend
in the world who'd appreciate it.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.682
That's going to be
our little secret.

01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.195
As soon as your mommy
and daddy say you can.

01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:26.740
When do you get off from school?

01:26:38.557 --> 01:26:40.714
So what would that have meant?

01:26:40.809 --> 01:26:44.046
What do you mean? It
would've told us something.

01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:45.710
What are you talking about?

01:26:45.814 --> 01:26:48.422
Meg is pissed off because
Alex didn't leave a note.

01:26:48.525 --> 01:26:51.395
- Could he summed it up in a note?
- Maybe a long note.

01:26:51.779 --> 01:26:55.063
I can sum up people's
lives in 32 paragraphs.

01:26:55.115 --> 01:26:58.352
I did a rock band in a page and
a half and they had 2 drummers.

01:26:59.161 --> 01:27:01.567
Do you think this is funny?

01:27:02.289 --> 01:27:06.617
One of our best friends kills
himself and we don't know why.

01:27:07.211 --> 01:27:11.574
No one knows why anyone does anything.
Why did I choose these socks today?

01:27:12.299 --> 01:27:15.868
There's a great equation:
Your socks, Alex's death.

01:27:16.887 --> 01:27:18.665
They're pretty sad socks.

01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:22.048
I believe that everybody
does everything to get laid.

01:27:22.267 --> 01:27:23.843
Who said that? Freud?

01:27:23.894 --> 01:27:25.292
No, I did.

01:27:26.063 --> 01:27:30.130
All I'm saying is how could we
let Alex slip away like that?

01:27:30.192 --> 01:27:32.432
Maybe he let us slip away.
I never heard from him.

01:27:32.528 --> 01:27:35.563
- Did he hear from you?
- I tried. He resisted.

01:27:35.656 --> 01:27:37.054
It's true.

01:27:37.116 --> 01:27:40.566
We saw him a lot.
But he didn't tell us much.

01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:42.320
Not me anyway.

01:27:42.413 --> 01:27:44.522
I can't speak for Sarah.

01:27:44.707 --> 01:27:47.658
I knew he was unhappy.
That doesn't tell you much.

01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:50.573
I had no idea how bad it was.

01:27:50.754 --> 01:27:53.243
I think he wanted to
cut off from us...

01:27:53.298 --> 01:27:55.787
because he was so unhappy
with where he was at.

01:27:56.093 --> 01:27:58.701
Is that true, Chloe?
Did you feel that?

01:27:58.929 --> 01:28:02.249
I don't know. We had
some good times.

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:07.877
I haven't met many happy people
in my life. How do they act?

01:28:08.605 --> 01:28:10.632
I'm sitting here and I realize...

01:28:11.191 --> 01:28:13.847
I don't know what he
did for the last 5 years.

01:28:14.653 --> 01:28:17.344
I remember he left that
caseworker job in Boston.

01:28:17.448 --> 01:28:19.771
That was, what, '78 or so?

01:28:20.242 --> 01:28:22.731
I don't know why he was doing that.

01:28:22.786 --> 01:28:26.651
He was a scientific genius.
Why was he doing welfare work?

01:28:26.707 --> 01:28:28.667
Then the construction job.
What was that for?

01:28:28.959 --> 01:28:30.737
He didn't know what to do.

01:28:31.253 --> 01:28:32.995
I can relate to that.

01:28:34.048 --> 01:28:37.451
If you'd been in touch with him,
you could've saved his life?

01:28:37.676 --> 01:28:41.625
You have that effect on people?
Keep them all jolly, do you?

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.416
Wise up, folks. We're
alone out there.

01:28:45.476 --> 01:28:48.546
And tomorrow we're
going out there again.

01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:53.134
<i>It was straight of him not to cook
up a Reader's Digest condensation...</i>

01:28:53.192 --> 01:28:55.717
of his screwed up life
for our entertainment.

01:28:55.819 --> 01:29:00.099
I am sick of people selling
their psyches for attention.

01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:02.107
He was classier than that.

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:05.028
It was a real classy act
he pulled in the bathtub.

01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:09.817
For some people it isn't a question
of why kill yourself, but why not.

01:29:10.667 --> 01:29:15.364
Give me a break. Spare us the
tragic existential pose.

01:29:15.422 --> 01:29:17.698
Didn't mean to get into your area.

01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:21.078
Come on now, guys. We're
all friends here.

01:29:21.887 --> 01:29:23.332
This is a well-known dynamic.

01:29:23.389 --> 01:29:25.139
I've seen it a million times.
Some people...

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:29.208
ease the pain of separation by
denigrating their relationship.

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:32.468
You're so deep.

01:29:33.607 --> 01:29:35.716
I think Michael's right.

01:29:35.776 --> 01:29:39.096
I feel shitty about 10
different ways tonight.

01:29:39.154 --> 01:29:40.932
I don't want to let any of this go.

01:29:41.156 --> 01:29:45.650
That's healthy. The only way to avoid
pain is to pretend you don't care.

01:29:45.703 --> 01:29:47.942
I know. I've left more
places than you'll ever go.

01:29:47.996 --> 01:29:49.739
Give him your pose line, Sam.

01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:52.446
There's the existential man for you.
You're one tough cookie.

01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:53.899
I could say you're one...

01:29:54.002 --> 01:29:57.821
cold, manipulative guy
and it wouldn't bother you.

01:29:58.215 --> 01:30:00.040
I'm deeply hurt.

01:30:00.259 --> 01:30:02.119
At least our last
night will be fun.

01:30:02.177 --> 01:30:04.287
Please don't do this, guys.

01:30:05.097 --> 01:30:09.591
This is happening because we miss him.
And we're really hurting.

01:30:10.894 --> 01:30:12.968
That's a crock of shit!

01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:16.341
We're afraid just the
opposite is true.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.676
Alex died for most of
us a long time ago.

01:30:19.987 --> 01:30:22.393
I think you're a crock of shit.

01:30:22.823 --> 01:30:24.850
Don't speak for me or anybody else.

01:30:24.908 --> 01:30:27.267
You hate your life.
That's your problem.

01:30:27.453 --> 01:30:29.610
- Don't tell us how we feel, okay?
- That's it.

01:30:29.663 --> 01:30:32.947
That's all I'm saying. If I
hate my life, it's my problem.

01:30:34.084 --> 01:30:38.234
Too bad you weren't around to
comfort Alex as compassionately.

01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:42.413
We go back a long way.

01:30:42.509 --> 01:30:45.117
I won't piss that away because
you're higher than a kite.

01:30:45.179 --> 01:30:48.048
A long time ago we knew each
other for a short period.

01:30:48.098 --> 01:30:51.169
You don't know anything about me.

01:30:51.894 --> 01:30:54.585
It was easy then. No one had
a cushier berth than we did.

01:30:54.646 --> 01:30:56.673
It's not surprising our
friendship could survive that.

01:30:56.732 --> 01:30:59.505
It's only here in the
world that it gets tough.

01:31:00.986 --> 01:31:02.597
I don't care what you say.

01:31:04.073 --> 01:31:06.977
I know I loved you and
everybody else here.

01:31:07.034 --> 01:31:09.939
And I'll go on believing
that till I kick.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.201
What's wrong with you?
What's happened to you?

01:31:35.104 --> 01:31:36.418
Wait!

01:31:41.944 --> 01:31:45.762
I believe you can help
other people. I really do.

01:31:45.823 --> 01:31:47.137
Sorry about that.

01:31:47.241 --> 01:31:48.721
I do too.

01:31:49.159 --> 01:31:52.146
Not that you can save
them, probably not.

01:31:52.246 --> 01:31:54.355
But you can do what you can do.

01:31:54.415 --> 01:31:56.441
That's how I feel.

01:31:58.961 --> 01:32:01.866
So lay into me now.
Really let me have it.

01:32:01.922 --> 01:32:04.993
I was just trying to keep
the conversation lively.

01:32:06.969 --> 01:32:10.585
So you'll continue to
love me no matter what?

01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:12.499
Just don't cross me.

01:32:14.059 --> 01:32:16.252
Could you help me
in here for a sec?

01:32:21.525 --> 01:32:24.809
Well, I think I've had enough.

01:32:54.433 --> 01:32:56.922
I love you very much.

01:33:00.355 --> 01:33:01.931
I'm yours.

01:33:02.524 --> 01:33:05.262
I want you to do something for me.

01:33:05.903 --> 01:33:07.182
Anything.

01:33:07.738 --> 01:33:10.061
I'd marry you, if you want.

01:33:10.157 --> 01:33:11.816
No, wait. I did that.

01:33:12.242 --> 01:33:13.985
Yes, you did.

01:33:14.036 --> 01:33:15.695
Thank God.

01:33:17.915 --> 01:33:19.657
It's about Meg.

01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:47.632
Where to?

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.849
You know, I don't do anything.

01:34:04.294 --> 01:34:05.490
It's me.

01:34:05.546 --> 01:34:08.034
Come on in. Nobody else will.

01:35:07.024 --> 01:35:10.178
This bed has always been
lucky for Sarah and me.

01:35:13.489 --> 01:35:16.014
I got to try and relax.

01:35:19.036 --> 01:35:21.442
I think I just forgot how to do it.

01:35:39.807 --> 01:35:41.038
What, what?

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.838
It's not going to come out right.

01:35:43.977 --> 01:35:45.257
Try me.

01:35:49.441 --> 01:35:53.556
I feel like I got a great
break on a used car.

01:36:12.214 --> 01:36:13.908
I remember this.

01:36:15.759 --> 01:36:18.035
I remember when he got this.

01:37:09.855 --> 01:37:12.261
<i>I must tell you...</i>

01:37:12.775 --> 01:37:16.011
<i>I'm picking up vibrations
here at the house.</i>

01:37:16.111 --> 01:37:19.763
<i>I'm almost certain there's
sex going on around here.</i>

01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:24.770
<i>Have I ever told you how
beautiful your eyes are?</i>

01:37:28.332 --> 01:37:29.812
<i>My head.</i>

01:37:33.712 --> 01:37:35.193
<i>Your feet.</i>

01:37:37.091 --> 01:37:38.701
<i>Tell me about the club.</i>

01:37:38.759 --> 01:37:41.248
<i>Fuck the club. I couldn't
deal with the hours.</i>

01:37:41.303 --> 01:37:43.543
<i>It'd be nothing but aggravation.</i>

01:37:43.847 --> 01:37:46.669
<i>Let's say it becomes successful.
I become a star.</i>

01:37:46.767 --> 01:37:51.012
<i>People magazine sends a
nasty schmuck like me...</i>

01:37:51.063 --> 01:37:52.805
<i>to do interviews. Big deal.</i>

01:37:52.856 --> 01:37:55.630
<i>Nope. I'm going back to my novel.</i>

01:37:56.151 --> 01:37:57.596
<i>I'll write about this weekend.</i>

01:37:57.694 --> 01:38:00.017
<i>What were you going to
write about before?</i>

01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:03.149
<i>Last weekend.</i>

01:39:07.473 --> 01:39:09.879
If Richard and I bring
the boys to L.A...

01:39:09.975 --> 01:39:13.211
maybe you could get
us in to see a studio.

01:39:13.604 --> 01:39:15.179
Yeah, sure.

01:39:15.272 --> 01:39:16.966
Absolutely.

01:39:17.274 --> 01:39:18.849
No problem.

01:39:19.777 --> 01:39:21.139
Good.

01:39:22.571 --> 01:39:24.479
Richard would like that.

01:39:36.543 --> 01:39:38.403
I'm the worst about writing.

01:39:38.462 --> 01:39:42.197
But I promise I will, from
now on, answer your letters.

01:39:42.257 --> 01:39:44.913
- Great.
- Good morning, youngsters.

01:39:45.844 --> 01:39:49.081
So how did everybody
sleep last night?

01:39:49.139 --> 01:39:51.379
Did anybody sleep last night?

01:39:53.352 --> 01:39:55.924
I know I did. All
alone in my airplane.

01:39:55.979 --> 01:39:59.216
No co-pilot. I slept like a baby.
Even wet the bed.

01:39:59.525 --> 01:40:01.598
Drink your coffee, Michael.

01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:06.724
I'll come see you whether
you like it or not.

01:40:07.658 --> 01:40:09.138
Well, good morning.

01:40:10.619 --> 01:40:12.064
Good morning.

01:40:13.163 --> 01:40:14.739
How you doing?

01:40:15.874 --> 01:40:18.233
Don't have to be in
such a good mood.

01:40:21.505 --> 01:40:24.326
Look what I found in Alex's papers.

01:40:26.927 --> 01:40:29.618
I will be in Detroit
sometime on this deal...

01:40:29.722 --> 01:40:31.998
and I'm just dying
to meet your boys.

01:40:32.057 --> 01:40:33.288
I'd love it.

01:40:33.392 --> 01:40:36.047
- You're all welcome in New York.
- Great!

01:40:36.103 --> 01:40:38.876
Not in my apartment, you understand.
But in the city.

01:40:38.939 --> 01:40:42.057
I'll accompany you anywhere,
even to Elaine's.

01:40:42.151 --> 01:40:43.549
Thought Elaine's was dead.

01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:46.218
That's why I can get you guys in.

01:40:46.947 --> 01:40:48.096
What's that?

01:40:48.157 --> 01:40:51.975
The column I wrote about Alex when
he turned down the fellowship.

01:40:53.203 --> 01:40:55.562
This is not bad. Good, clean style.

01:40:55.622 --> 01:40:59.322
Lean, economical, the right touch
of ideological fanaticism.

01:40:59.543 --> 01:41:02.151
I remember Alex was
angry about that.

01:41:02.254 --> 01:41:03.948
What do you mean?
I made him famous.

01:41:04.048 --> 01:41:05.991
Think he saved it
because he hated it?

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:08.207
He also saved his induction notice.

01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:11.662
I'm collecting addresses.
Do you have one?

01:41:11.722 --> 01:41:14.164
Or should I copy down
your license plate?

01:41:16.685 --> 01:41:19.174
You can reach Nick
here for a while.

01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:24.180
Nick and Chloe will stay here and
do some work at the old house.

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:40.031
I guess there's a certain
symmetry to that.

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.074
What's the flight schedule here?
Is there any way...

01:41:46.173 --> 01:41:48.330
to coordinate the
airport transport?

01:41:48.384 --> 01:41:49.912
I'll be glad to drive somebody.

01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:52.748
Great, if we can take Harold's car.

01:41:53.055 --> 01:41:54.417
Get Harold to drive it.

01:41:54.473 --> 01:41:56.381
You're no fun.

01:41:56.725 --> 01:42:00.045
That won't be necessary.
We took a secret vote.

01:42:00.145 --> 01:42:02.304
We're not leaving.
We're never leaving.
