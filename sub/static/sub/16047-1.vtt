Busy, actually.
Joel is here.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.808
Yeah, speaking.

03:55.273 --> 03:57.245
Hello?

04:10.355 --> 04:12.757
- Are you all right?
- You are pissed!

04:12.857 --> 04:14.692
- Are you tipsy?
- No. What?

04:14.693 --> 04:18.228
- You stink of beer.
- I stink of beer.

04:18.728 --> 04:21.449
- No.
- How many have you had?

04:21.450 --> 04:22.850
- None.
- None. No beer?

04:22.935 --> 04:25.470
- We raised a glass.
- For why? For why?

04:25.570 --> 04:28.289
We made a breakthrough,
actually.

04:28.314 --> 04:29.832
In what form?

04:29.908 --> 04:31.760
In the form
of an APP.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.078
- If you want to be...
- Specific about it?

04:34.178 --> 04:37.174
- It is specific, an APP. Yeah.
- What does it do?

04:37.274 --> 04:42.487
The APP... the app is restaurant-based,
but with a foodie app.

04:42.587 --> 04:46.391
This is many questions at
this time. I mean this...

04:46.491 --> 04:48.247
My God! My God!

04:48.472 --> 04:51.987
I am just... I am
sorry I am late. I...

04:52.063 --> 04:55.434
Jennifer thinks
that you...

04:55.534 --> 04:57.478
are absolutely
full of shit.

04:57.503 --> 04:58.785
So full of shit.

04:58.885 --> 05:00.835
- Full of shit.
- Well, I love Jennifer.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.479
One well done
steak for you, sir.

05:02.487 --> 05:03.887
Thank you. Wow!

05:04.242 --> 05:05.753
You ordered for me!

05:05.778 --> 05:08.271
You get the
same every time.

05:08.347 --> 05:10.504
I do not. I am
very adventurous.

05:10.529 --> 05:12.407
My God,
you are pissed.

05:13.183 --> 05:15.089
I am a little
pissed.

05:16.888 --> 05:19.358
- Do you want a drink?
- No, I am good, thanks.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.193
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:22.293 --> 05:25.464
- Did you feed Vivian?
- Yeah.

05:25.564 --> 05:30.305
- Because the bowl is empty.
- Well, she must have been hungry.

05:31.236 --> 05:34.206
Did he not feed you, little
baby? Did he not feed you?

05:34.306 --> 05:36.645
No!

05:39.378 --> 05:40.904
Great! Just
what I fancied.

05:40.929 --> 05:43.271
Half an hour. Half
an hour. I promise.

05:43.347 --> 05:45.850
It is a big
tournament, this.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.880
Do you know how
ridiculous that sounds?

05:47.905 --> 05:49.305
Yes.

05:50.455 --> 05:52.727
Right, I will see
you tomorrow.

05:54.993 --> 05:57.498

No, wait, wait, and wait. I
am not the guy you want.

I am nothing. You
know, I am no one.

10:25.393 --> 10:26.681
<i>You are wasting
time, Matthew.</i>

10:26.757 --> 10:28.339

Do you know what
is going on here?

33:28.587 --> 33:30.187
What are they
trying to do to me?

33:30.914 --> 33:32.718
What the fuck is
going on here?

33:33.818 --> 33:35.418
They said to
deliver a package.

33:35.443 --> 33:36.668
I have to bring
it here,

33:36.692 --> 33:38.035
deliver a
package to you.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.060
There is this girl,
and now I am singing.

33:40.391 --> 33:42.262
What the fuck
am I singing?

33:43.577 --> 33:45.864
Help me. What the
fuck am I singing?

33:47.031 --> 33:51.446
Deliver the package.
Yes.

33:54.005 --> 33:56.796
Yeah. I cannot
open it.

33:58.376 --> 34:00.247
I do not know
the code.

34:21.031 --> 34:22.737
They do this
to you!

34:42.704 --> 34:45.036
KEON ROPER 317 BRUNSWICK
TOWER FAIRVIEW ESTATE

34:47.690 --> 34:49.091
Who is this?

34:50.027 --> 34:52.931
He is who you
must to kill.

34:53.864 --> 34:56.099
If you do not...

34:56.199 --> 34:58.538
they will kill her.

34:59.770 --> 35:03.482
This is what I am
to say to you.

35:10.781 --> 35:14.552
I cannot... I cannot do
that. I cannot do that.

35:14.652 --> 35:18.692
If you do not, they
will kill her.

35:19.907 --> 35:23.513
It is his
life or hers.

35:26.797 --> 35:29.703
I cannot kill
someone. I cannot.

35:32.036 --> 35:34.574
In addition,
neither could I.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.783
<I>Head to Cleveland
Street.</I>

36:25.799 --> 36:28.041
<i>Someone will make
contact with you there.</i>

36:28.478 --> 36:30.616
Fuck you!

36:31.294 --> 36:32.832
Fuck you!

36:52.452 --> 36:53.852
<i>Anna says hello.</i>

36:53.876 --> 36:56.448
<i>She is counting
on you, Matthew.</i>

37:37.828 --> 37:39.228
What are you doing?

37:39.916 --> 37:41.316
<i>- Matt?</I>
- Hey?</i>

37:41.340 --> 37:42.740
<i>Matt?</I></i>

37:43.169 --> 37:44.569
What?

37:44.593 --> 37:46.795
Yeah, Matt goes to
the Fairview Estate.

37:47.071 --> 37:49.071
Yeah, you do not look
so surprised, mate.

37:49.095 --> 37:50.111
You booked me.

37:50.274 --> 37:51.145
<i>Well, get a
wiggle on.</i>

37:51.170 --> 37:52.803
<i>While I am
still young.</i>

38:00.318 --> 38:01.718
London is massive!

38:01.751 --> 38:03.927
London is... I have
been to Paris.

38:04.103 --> 38:05.958
It is a big town.
It is a big town.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.227
There is no doubt
about that.

38:07.378 --> 38:09.528
Very, very, very, very,
very, very big town.

38:09.738 --> 38:11.619
However, nothing
compared to London.

38:11.795 --> 38:13.246
All the roads,
all weird.

38:13.271 --> 38:15.390
All medieval. We got
medieval stuff.

38:15.466 --> 38:17.716
You do not get me wrong,
our medieval stuff...

38:17.741 --> 38:19.491
is better than their
medieval stuff.

38:19.644 --> 38:22.473
However, our medieval stuff
is easier to drive around.

38:22.573 --> 38:24.021
Do you know
what I mean?

38:24.046 --> 38:25.667
Listen! You
will love this.

38:25.743 --> 38:27.495
I had a geezer in
earlier,

38:27.520 --> 38:29.120
sitting there
casual as you like,

38:29.144 --> 38:31.649
browsing through
a porno mag.

38:31.849 --> 38:33.599
Nothing horrible,
just your basic...

38:33.625 --> 38:35.497
top-shelf shit, you
know what I mean.

38:35.520 --> 38:39.160
Still, I mean, that is not
normal behavior is it?

38:40.211 --> 38:41.611
What?

38:41.635 --> 38:44.251
Porno mag, in a taxi, I
know is not normal, is it?

38:44.424 --> 38:45.924
Moreover, that
got me thinking.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.821
Who reads porno mags
anyway, these days?

38:49.621 --> 38:51.918
It is also free, I mean.
You do not need it.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.112
Who would
volunteer that?

38:54.157 --> 38:55.907
Go into a shop pick
up a magazine,

38:56.047 --> 38:57.472
then you have
to pay for it.

38:57.496 --> 38:58.561
Surely, that is
humiliating,

38:58.786 --> 38:59.867
but people
must do it,

38:59.943 --> 39:01.927
Otherwise, they
would not be there,

39:02.052 --> 39:03.790
all stacked up,
proud as punch,

39:03.890 --> 39:05.589
in all their glory.

39:07.751 --> 39:09.290
Are you all
right, mate?

39:11.555 --> 39:13.370
Only you do not
look too good,

39:13.396 --> 39:14.972
if you do not
mind I am saying.

39:19.096 --> 39:20.799
Shitty day!

39:21.199 --> 39:23.297
All right, brother.
We have all had them.

39:23.322 --> 39:25.219
We have all
had them.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.405
Get a haircut, man!

41:53.417 --> 41:54.822
Who are you?

41:57.155 --> 41:58.557
Matt.

41:59.357 --> 42:00.951
Fuck off, Matt.

42:01.876 --> 42:03.332
I am here for Keon.

42:08.850 --> 42:10.252
What do you want?

42:11.252 --> 42:14.825
- Just... some drugs.
- Drugs?

42:15.256 --> 42:17.294
Anything in
particular?

42:21.162 --> 42:22.967
Cannabis.

42:27.368 --> 42:29.639
Are you the police?

42:32.473 --> 42:33.944
No.

42:35.176 --> 42:37.011
No.

42:37.211 --> 42:38.831
I am just fucking
with you.

42:39.055 --> 42:42.073
Police would not have
looked like a limp dick.

42:42.250 --> 42:46.820
Keon is asleep, but I
will... sort you out.

42:47.020 --> 42:48.420
Enter.

43:25.026 --> 43:27.197
Wait in here.

43:39.273 --> 43:41.309
<i>Jesus! Can you
smell yourself?</i>

43:41.409 --> 43:44.383
<i>When was the last time
you took a fucking bath?</i>

43:44.408 --> 43:45.808
<I>Get in there.</I>

43:49.883 --> 43:51.283
Sit.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.420
Sit.

43:54.055 --> 43:55.993
Fucking sit!

44:00.461 --> 44:01.932
Fucking pricks.

44:09.070 --> 44:10.508
Are you all right?

44:23.584 --> 44:25.022
Are you all right?

44:54.679 --> 44:57.285
God! My God! Anna.

44:57.385 --> 44:59.588
I am so, so sorry.

44:59.888 --> 45:02.192
I did not... I did
not know, baby.

45:02.217 --> 45:04.452
I swear I did not
know. I am sorry.

45:05.393 --> 45:07.028
I am so sorry.

45:07.428 --> 45:09.399
Did you get
a smoke?

45:12.333 --> 45:13.871
Did you get
a smoke?

45:18.572 --> 45:20.477
Did you get
a smoke?

46:15.829 --> 46:18.135
<i>I am fucking
talking to you!</i>

47:07.104 --> 47:08.814
<i>Do you understand
what I am saying?</i>

47:08.838 --> 47:11.576
<i>Do you understand?
Get fuck, you mong!</i>

47:12.453 --> 47:13.891
My God!

48:42.077 --> 48:44.944
<i>You have 45 minutes to
deliver the package.</i>

48:45.179 --> 48:46.979
<i>If you ever want to
see Leonie again.</i>

48:47.003 --> 48:48.470
<i>Go to 87 first
Avenue.</i>

48:48.499 --> 48:50.599
<i>Go to the Blue Box
nightclub on Old Street.</i>

48:50.623 --> 48:53.290
<i>Gustav will be waiting
for you there.</i>

49:00.893 --> 49:02.643
<i>If you do not proceed
as instructed.</i>

49:02.955 --> 49:04.505
<i>You will never see
Leonie again.</i>

49:05.673 --> 49:07.673
<i>Keep the Bitch.</i>

49:50.210 --> 49:51.649
What are you doing?

49:59.820 --> 50:01.859
I need to use
the toilet.

50:06.160 --> 50:08.161
You should have
gone in the lift.

50:16.103 --> 50:17.742
Get a move on.

50:34.021 --> 50:36.426
You two, meet me
at the level.

51:02.454 --> 51:05.954
LAST MAN STANDING
SCORE K.D.A

51:08.889 --> 51:11.195
<I>Hey, where is my
fucking phone, man?</I>

51:16.730 --> 51:19.300
Hey, where is my
fucking phone, man?

51:19.400 --> 51:21.126
How the fuck
do I know?

51:21.151 --> 51:22.696
Give me a tip.

51:22.791 --> 51:24.291
Change, man.

51:26.174 --> 51:28.378
Who is this
fool sleeping?

51:34.648 --> 51:36.486
Hi sweetheart?

51:40.153 --> 51:41.755
Who are the two?

51:41.855 --> 51:43.493
<i>Punters, man.</i>

51:47.495 --> 51:48.895
Yeah?

51:49.463 --> 51:51.213
How long am I going
to have these...

51:51.238 --> 51:53.121
fucking white boys
in my living room?

51:53.397 --> 51:55.305
<i>I will deal
with them.</i>

52:08.081 --> 52:10.620
<i>Hey, have you
seen my phone?</i>

52:11.179 --> 52:12.579
Hey my phone, bro!

52:12.603 --> 52:14.041
What did you want?

52:23.597 --> 52:25.902
One... One bag.

52:27.635 --> 52:29.973
One bag?

52:35.809 --> 52:37.211
Yeah.

52:38.011 --> 52:40.548
What the fuck
is a one bag?

52:41.048 --> 52:44.688
You know, just...
one bag.

52:48.622 --> 52:50.807
I will give you
a special.

52:50.832 --> 52:52.450
Heavy smokers only.

52:52.526 --> 52:55.432
Three grams
for 120 quid.

52:58.198 --> 53:00.370
It is pollen.
It will fluff out.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.445
Fuck's sake!

53:10.659 --> 53:12.059
You can owe me.

53:12.083 --> 53:14.672
<i>Hey! Do you
take my phone?</i>

53:14.948 --> 53:17.118
<i>You take my
fucking phone!</i>

53:17.318 --> 53:18.719
Well, someone did.

53:18.744 --> 53:21.288
Someone took my
fucking phone.

53:21.388 --> 53:22.044
This will be funny.

53:22.569 --> 53:25.292
<i>Hey, listen, am I
a fucking dickhead?</i>

53:25.393 --> 53:28.028
<i>You playing that fucking
game while I am talking?</i>

53:28.128 --> 53:30.907
<i>Where is my phone?
Where is my phone?</i>

53:30.932 --> 53:33.291
<i>What the fuck are
you laughing at?</i>

53:33.516 --> 53:34.916
<i>Do you think
it is funny?</i>

53:34.940 --> 53:35.567
<i>I was not laughing.</i>

53:35.591 --> 53:38.808
<i>No one is leaving here
until I get my shit.</i>

53:39.033 --> 53:39.931
<i>Do you understand?</i>

53:40.007 --> 53:41.757
<i>Do you think this
is a fucking joke?</i>

53:41.788 --> 53:42.620
<i>He. The other one.</i>

53:42.645 --> 53:44.045
<i>Get up. Do you
have my shit?</i>

53:44.238 --> 53:45.923
<i>- Do you have my shit?
- No. No.</i>

53:46.023 --> 53:47.991
<i>No? Well,
someone does.</i>

53:48.016 --> 53:50.357
<i>Where is the
other white boy?</i>

53:51.708 --> 53:53.108
<i>Do you
understand me?</i>

53:53.132 --> 53:55.633
<i>Do you understand the words
coming out of my mouth?</i>

53:56.390 --> 54:00.844
<i>Where is the
other white boy?</i>

54:01.594 --> 54:04.864
You. Where the fuck
have you been?

54:05.433 --> 54:08.137
Where the fuck have
you been, boy?

54:09.737 --> 54:11.773
You stole my phone.

54:12.273 --> 54:14.036
You stole my phone.
Yeah.

54:14.061 --> 54:15.891
He stole my
fucking phone.

54:16.333 --> 54:18.425
You stole my fucking
phone! Where is it?

54:18.450 --> 54:20.630
Where the fuck
is it? Where is it?

54:21.016 --> 54:22.772
Where is my
fucking phone?

54:22.797 --> 54:24.854
Where is my phone?
Where is it?

54:24.982 --> 54:26.382
Where is my...?
He took my phone.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.995
- Have you been robbed?
- Yeah. I will.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.924
I have been robbed. I had
it when I went in the room.

54:29.949 --> 54:31.004
Now it is gone.
Where is it?

54:31.075 --> 54:32.876
Where is he? You
do not fuck with me.

54:32.900 --> 54:34.369
I do not know!
I do not know!

54:34.445 --> 54:35.325
Where is my phone?

54:35.350 --> 54:36.945
I did not take
no one's phone.

54:36.969 --> 54:38.668
Shut up. I know
what he has done.

54:38.693 --> 54:40.093
I know what
he has done.

54:40.217 --> 54:41.793
I saw him dropping the
stuff to his mates,

54:41.818 --> 54:43.368
through the window
in that room.

54:43.487 --> 54:45.347
That is what you fucking
did, did not you?

54:45.372 --> 54:46.381
You motherfucker!

54:46.557 --> 54:47.526
I am going
to go down.

54:47.551 --> 54:49.531
I am going to go down
and speak to his mates.

54:49.593 --> 54:51.593
I am going to go down and I
am going to roughen them up.

54:51.618 --> 54:52.493
Roughen them up.

54:52.517 --> 54:53.730
Right now, that is
what I am going to do.

54:53.755 --> 54:55.505
I am going to fucking
sort them out.

55:18.321 --> 55:19.721
Hey?

55:24.361 --> 55:25.761
Shit!

55:26.063 --> 55:28.802
You fucking prick!
Come on.

55:32.670 --> 55:36.240
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!

55:36.940 --> 55:38.340
<i>Get him!</i>

55:43.048 --> 55:45.581
<i>Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!</i>

56:56.994 --> 56:58.594
<i>You did not complete
your task...</i>

57:53.316 --> 57:54.716
KARAOKE

58:11.466 --> 58:12.966
<i>You did not complete
your task.</i>

58:12.990 --> 58:15.340
<i>Return to Fairview Estate
immediately or Anna...</i>

58:18.354 --> 58:20.173
Come on.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.253
Are you going to order
something, boss?

59:39.578 --> 59:42.293
Yeah, I will get a double
beef bangle burger.

59:42.369 --> 59:44.575
- With chips, yeah?
- I am all right.

59:55.298 --> 59:58.605
- 5.50, bro.
- I did not want any mayo.

59:59.737 --> 01:00:01.787
- It is garlic sauce!
- I do not want any.

01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:04.185
Give me another burger
without mayonnaise.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:05.961
It is not Mayo.
It is garlic sauce.

01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:07.461
Give me another
burger!

01:00:11.348 --> 01:00:14.285
- What... what is it?
- Are you the manager?

01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:16.685
Yeah.

01:00:17.621 --> 01:00:20.524
Sorry. Is there
a problem?

01:00:21.524 --> 01:00:23.795
- Can I use your toilet?
- Yeah.

01:00:24.995 --> 01:00:26.395
Down the hall.

01:00:31.535 --> 01:00:34.061
<i>What is going on?
What is the problem?</i>

01:00:34.186 --> 01:00:36.063
<i>Stupid customer!</i>

01:00:36.108 --> 01:00:37.816
<i>Wait! What are
you doing?</i>

01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:40.312
<i>You do not call the
customer stupid.</i>

01:00:40.343 --> 01:00:43.782
<i>You do not think about
customers like that!</i>

01:00:55.726 --> 01:00:59.099
<i>You get out! Bloody
waste of space!</i>

01:01:17.514 --> 01:01:19.750
<i>Are you going to
order something?</i>

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.356
<i>Yeah, I will get a double
beef bangle burger.</i>

01:01:24.221 --> 01:01:27.060
<i>- With chips, yeah?
- I am all right.</i>

01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:13.017
<i>Your clothes off. Just
fucking get it done!</i>

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.080
Hey?

01:02:58.467 --> 01:02:59.867
What is that
back there?

01:02:59.891 --> 01:03:01.872
What were you watching?
What is that?

01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:03.854
- Watching?
- Yeah.

01:03:04.478 --> 01:03:05.878
Nothing. I am not
watching anything.

01:03:05.902 --> 01:03:06.616
What are you doing?

01:03:06.692 --> 01:03:08.124
I saw you earlier
filming me.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.999
You are part of
this, are not you?

01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:11.314
I want you out.
Get out!

01:03:11.339 --> 01:03:13.454
Get back! Get back!
Get back! Get back!

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:17.170
Drop the ladle! Drop
the ladle. Drop it.

01:03:18.635 --> 01:03:20.371
Is this a game?

01:03:20.871 --> 01:03:23.274
Do you bet on
this game?

01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:25.274
Take my girlfriend,
nearly kill me...

01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:26.698
for a fucking game!

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:29.148
Are you a part of
this? Who are you?

01:03:29.747 --> 01:03:32.618
I just make the burgers.
I know nothing.

01:03:39.756 --> 01:03:41.156
This is not real.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.998
None of it has
been real.

01:03:48.198 --> 01:03:49.969
This gun is...

01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:53.404
It is not going to
kill anyone.

01:03:54.304 --> 01:03:55.939
It is not
even real.

01:03:57.392 --> 01:03:58.812
You are fucking...

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:03.758
- Shit!
- You motherfucking!

01:04:03.858 --> 01:04:05.165
You shot my leg!

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.058
I am sorry. I am
sorry. I am so...

01:04:07.082 --> 01:04:07.648
Motherfucker!

01:04:07.773 --> 01:04:09.173
I am sorry. I
am so sorry.

01:04:09.242 --> 01:04:13.217
You fucker! You
motherfucking bhenchod!

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.254
He shot my
bloody leg!

01:04:20.197 --> 01:04:22.535
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit!

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.983
<i>I am sorry, Anna.</i>

01:05:15.263 --> 01:05:17.114
<i>I am sorry for
everything.</i>

01:05:42.979 --> 01:05:44.884
<i>You are an
arsehole!</i>

01:08:18.434 --> 01:08:19.872
Come on!

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.140
No.

01:08:36.018 --> 01:08:39.055
Get your fucking
hands off me!

01:08:39.255 --> 01:08:42.993
No! No! No!

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.621
No! No! No!

01:08:46.929 --> 01:08:49.532
Fucking... Fuck!

01:08:50.645 --> 01:08:54.368
No! No! No!

01:08:56.304 --> 01:08:57.703
No!

01:09:27.804 --> 01:09:30.207
Hello, Matthew?

01:09:30.307 --> 01:09:33.609
Well done!
It is over.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.982
She is just through
that door.

01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:40.654
You should
be proud.

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:44.858
You have to see who
you really are.

01:09:47.325 --> 01:09:49.796
It has been funny.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.232
Anna? Anna?

01:10:41.178 --> 01:10:43.049
Anna?

01:10:58.061 --> 01:10:59.461
No!

01:13:19.602 --> 01:13:21.002
Is this what
you want?

01:13:24.074 --> 01:13:25.912
I to kill someone.

01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:32.519
Is this what
you want?

01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:47.566
I want to know
who I am.

01:14:24.935 --> 01:14:27.340
You have not
to do this.

01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:36.616
I do.

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.040
<i>If you want to see
your daughter again.</i>

01:15:44.064 --> 01:15:45.664
<i>Go to Bank Station.</i>

01:15:46.722 --> 01:15:48.155
<i>Get the Package
from the man,</i>

01:15:48.173 --> 01:15:50.223
<i>in the Blue jacket at
the Shopping Centre.</i>

01:15:58.509 --> 01:15:59.909
<i>At the Factory
kill the man,</i>

01:15:59.933 --> 01:16:02.400
<i>with the Package or your
Daughter will be killed.</i>

01:17:24.314 --> 01:17:27.698
Matt, what...? What
happened to you?

01:17:27.723 --> 01:17:29.123
Matt? Matt?

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.984
What happened to
you? Matt, please...

01:17:32.009 --> 01:17:33.602
What happened
to your face?

01:17:33.678 --> 01:17:37.294
Who has done this to
you? Matt, please.

01:17:37.394 --> 01:17:40.297
Matt... Matt. What
are you looking at?

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.289
Look at me.

01:17:41.364 --> 01:17:43.858
What happened to you?
Please talk to me.

01:17:43.883 --> 01:17:45.283
Hey, wait. Wait.

01:17:45.435 --> 01:17:47.606
Have you been here
the whole time?

01:17:48.505 --> 01:17:52.845
Yeah, of course! I...
I do not think...

01:17:59.482 --> 01:18:01.921
I am so sorry.

01:19:29.506 --> 01:19:33.185
Hi. Yeah. Yeah!
It has all sorted.

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.463
Well, he saw the
fake photograph.

01:19:35.913 --> 01:19:38.902
It was a good bloody
game, though. So...

01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:43.922
Who is next?

01:20:24.304 --> 01:20:26.759
Fuck's sake!

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:44.454
