who want to use the telescope?

I'm worried that you're not
experiencing the full range of--

10:35.136 --> 10:37.107
things to experience
in high school.

10:37.140 --> 10:39.979
-No, thank you, I would like to
book the telescope for tonight.

are tonight.

10:44.923 --> 10:46.425
Why not give that
a shot, huh?

10:46.458 --> 10:47.962
-I don't know
how to act.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.899
-Anyone can act.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.402
I'll get Miss Berry
to put aside some books

10:51.435 --> 10:53.807
at the library
for you.

10:53.841 --> 10:55.744
Think of it
as an experiment.

10:57.849 --> 11:00.754
And, also, Michelle asked me
if I could get more students

11:00.788 --> 11:04.729
to audition for the play and
I really want her to like me.

Michelle was
losing her mind.

[Astrid laughs]

40:30.559 --> 40:32.563

kind of surprising, though.

about your date.

Details.
[Laughs]

40:40.546 --> 40:41.948
-It was good.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.652
-Uh-huh?

40:44.687 --> 40:46.524
-Okay, we kissed.
-What!?

40:47.092 --> 40:50.064
Oh, my God,
my best friend got kissed!

40:50.098 --> 40:52.570
- That's right. I got kissed!
I got kissed!

40:52.603 --> 40:54.741

[Happy sighs]

41:03.124 --> 41:05.963
-Hey, what if we like each other
for real, though?

41:05.996 --> 41:08.100
I don't think
I could handle it.

41:08.134 --> 41:10.606
-Uh...
You'll be fine.

41:10.639 --> 41:12.810
You just stabbed a guy
for his rib.

41:12.843 --> 41:14.580
-Yeah,
you're right.

41:14.614 --> 41:16.083
Ah, God,
we're cool.

41:16.116 --> 41:17.820
-Mm-hm.

41:17.853 --> 41:18.855
-We should get...

41:18.889 --> 41:20.158
-BOTH:
Matching tattoos!

41:20.191 --> 41:23.832
-I was thinking the same thing!
I was thinking the same thing!

41:23.865 --> 41:25.836
-I knew you were.
I knew you were.

41:25.869 --> 41:26.905
-No way!
-Wait!

41:26.938 --> 41:29.577
-What?
-Wait, I have a better idea.

41:29.610 --> 41:30.946
-Hm? Oh!

41:34.019 --> 41:35.723
And down.

41:35.756 --> 41:37.025
Yeah, I know
it's a monster thing,

41:37.058 --> 41:38.895
but I'm
pretty good at it.

41:38.929 --> 41:40.866
-I would say.
What was that again?

41:40.899 --> 41:41.735
-And drop!

41:41.768 --> 41:43.605
No, no, no.
More hips, more hips.

41:43.638 --> 41:44.974
-Okay.

[Cicadas chirring]

42:09.857 --> 42:11.861

disturbance.

Weird.

[Knocking on door]

42:27.660 --> 42:29.129
-You have paint
on your face.

42:29.931 --> 42:31.768
-What do you want?

42:33.672 --> 42:34.974
-You left these...

42:35.007 --> 42:36.644
In the rec room.

42:36.678 --> 42:38.648
I thought it was trash
at first,

42:38.682 --> 42:40.184
but then I saw
your name.

42:40.218 --> 42:41.955
Hm.
Still...

[Chuckle]

42:43.725 --> 42:45.061

keep them.

42:45.094 --> 42:47.198
They're going to be
worth something someday

42:47.232 --> 42:48.935
very soon.
