00:10.276 --> 00:12.612
- Hello, Whitlock students.
I'm Mr. Pugh.

00:12.645 --> 00:15.248
And I'm very excited
to invite you

00:15.281 --> 00:16.683
to join the Toledo chapter

00:16.716 --> 00:19.185
of Ohio Naturalists.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.254
The program offers
hands-on learning

00:21.287 --> 00:23.523
and a chance to become
a citizen scientist.

00:23.556 --> 00:24.791
[bee buzzing]
Oh, hello, Mr. Bee.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.292
Oh.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.427
Looks like somebody
wants to get on camera.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.630
Uh, this year, we're going
on an overnight field trip

00:30.663 --> 00:33.299
to Swan Creek
Preserve Metropark--

00:33.333 --> 00:34.401
the bees are back.
Ah.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.603
Brought a friend.
Or two.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.605
Uh, you know,
bees are actually--

00:38.638 --> 00:39.673
they're very friendly.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.675
They--they know not to attack

00:41.708 --> 00:43.743
unless they're feeling
threatened or--

00:43.777 --> 00:45.612
[yelps]
Bananas!

00:45.645 --> 00:47.347
Got me.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.882
Sometimes they get confused,
but...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.216
Owee.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.584
[laughs awkwardly]

00:51.618 --> 00:54.688
Oh, well, uh...

00:54.721 --> 00:58.391
We will, uh, embark
on a variety of activities.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.227
Uh, from bird counts
to stream sampling.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.730
Plant identi--
please go away from--

01:03.763 --> 01:04.764
[crunches]

01:04.798 --> 01:07.233
Oh, no.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.202
I stepped on a goose nest.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.205
Oh.
Its babies.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.674
I squished them.
Oh, no.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.142
Go away!

01:16.176 --> 01:18.778

<i>I'll listen to my heart ♪</i>

01:18.812 --> 01:21.781

01:31.925 --> 01:33.393
<i>I'm nice.</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:35.261
<i>- Mr. Pugh asked me</i>
<i>to edit that out,</i>

01:35.295 --> 01:37.297
<i>but I do not know</i>
<i>how to do that.</i>

01:37.330 --> 01:38.398
[bell ringing]
<i>Okay, Rams.</i>

01:38.431 --> 01:39.766
<i>Get ready to grab the day by--</i>

01:39.799 --> 01:41.234
- When you're in the wild,

01:41.267 --> 01:42.802
if you need to heighten
your sense of smell,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.904
you lick your fingers
and wet your nostrils.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.240
Like so.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.510
- Like, if I'm a wolf?

01:50.543 --> 01:53.346
And I wanna sniff out
a fat bunny?

01:57.417 --> 02:00.220
Hm.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.421
- All right.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.523
Begin shutting your mouths up.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.558
I cannot believe
I'm saying this,

02:05.592 --> 02:08.261
but Sarika is now my favorite.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.597
Yeah--her aunt wants
to publish my book,

02:10.630 --> 02:13.366
"The Pursuit of Happiness
Through Societal Regression."

02:13.400 --> 02:15.301
We're meeting for dinner
tonight at Mansy's.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.370
- Mansy's is very romantic.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.239
I took Sarah,
my college girlfriend, there.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.940
- Oh!
You gave her a name!

02:20.974 --> 02:22.809
Nice!
But this is not a date.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.845
- Besides, my aunt only goes
for guys who drive BMWs.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.313
Not driver's ed cars.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.983
- And Heather's back
to being my favorite.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.785
- Don't call it a comeback.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.387
- Okay.
Yeah.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.222
So I guess the only question
that remains is

02:36.256 --> 02:37.590
how should I pose for the photo

02:37.624 --> 02:39.659
on the back cover
of my book, you know?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.529
Oh.
Maybe I'll hold this skull.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.431
Like Hamlet.
You know?

02:44.464 --> 02:45.999
But it'd be like
this child's skill,

02:46.032 --> 02:49.336
so my hands look bigger.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.972
You know,
so my hands look bigger.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.009
- Right.
Let's hold off on that.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.777
- Oh, okay.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.979
- I read the first chapter
of your book.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.748
You're clearly a good writer.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.016
- Oh.
Thanks.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.251
Yeah, I write
to discover what I know.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.021
That's Flannery O'Connor.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.389
- Cool.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.392
Now, perhaps you've heard
of my client,

03:12.425 --> 03:14.794
best-selling author,
Robin Schwonk.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.297
The final book in his
"Rock Bottom" trilogy,

03:17.330 --> 03:19.466
"Disgraced," is set to be
released in three weeks.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.434
But he's having
a personal trauma,

03:21.468 --> 03:23.303
and hasn't written it.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.638
His beloved Pekingese
has Psoriasis.

03:25.672 --> 03:26.873
- [snorts]

03:26.906 --> 03:28.375
Sorry, the elbow rash stuff?

03:28.408 --> 03:30.043
On a dog?
[laughs]

03:30.076 --> 03:32.579
- We need "Disgraced" ASAP.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.982
We have 50,000 pre-sales,
and I have spent the money.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.418
I finally had
my shoulders done.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.520
- Oh, good--good.
Yeah, no--sorry.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.788
What does this have to do
with my book?

03:41.821 --> 03:43.656
- This is your book.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.825
I want you
to write "Disgraced."

03:45.859 --> 03:47.861
- Uh...
- [scoffs]

03:47.894 --> 03:50.663
"A brilliant but emotionally
stunted psychopath

03:50.697 --> 03:52.732
"is disgraced and moves home
to the Midwest.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.468
His intense shame
drives him to murder."

03:55.502 --> 03:57.570
I mean, the main character
is basically you.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.739
- No, I--I don't relate
to that character at all.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.909
- Excuse me, sir.
Is this your child's skull?

04:02.942 --> 04:05.745
- It is.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.846
- I just got chills.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.481
You're perfect.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.684
Sarika told me you were
fired from Harvard,

04:10.717 --> 04:13.353
and live in your
dead mother's apartment.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.689
- Townhome.
- You are "Disgraced."

04:15.722 --> 04:17.924
- Sorry, I live in
my dead mother's townhome.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.693
- You'll be paid, of course.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.662
And if you nail this,
I will do everything I can

04:22.696 --> 04:24.764
to get your book published.

04:27.767 --> 04:28.968
- Okay.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.638
I'm in.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.906
[chuckling]
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.908
- Oh, oh.
Shoulders.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.976
- Right.
- [chuckles]

04:37.010 --> 04:38.345
- [laughing]

04:38.378 --> 04:39.746
- Oh.
Good morning, ladies.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.348
[laughs]
While you were out buying

04:41.381 --> 04:43.950
paintings of wine bottles
at TJ Maxx,

04:43.983 --> 04:47.020
I pulled one over on the rubes
who buy books at airports.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.789
I wrote a Schwonk.
- Whoa.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.858
You wrote a book
for Robin Schwonk?

04:51.891 --> 04:52.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Dang.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.929
I still remember reading
"Bone Freaks" when I was 13.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.731
That's where I learned
the word "areola."

04:57.764 --> 04:58.631
- Oh.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.499
- Anyway, I think you guys
are gonna be

04:59.532 --> 05:01.001
the perfect audience
for this, I do.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.002
Check--check this out.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.436
"I woke up in a seedy motel.

"What was left of the desk
clerk stared back to me.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.776
Eyes vacant--"
- Oh, God, stop!

05:09.809 --> 05:11.778
That's giving me
the creep sweats.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.014
- Hey, creep sweats are the
panties thrown on stage

05:14.047 --> 05:15.148
of horror writing, so.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.149
- [laughs]
- Jesus, Jack.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.617
It's 8:00 in the morning.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.019
- Yeah, oh, sorry.
I haven't slept.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.653
- Uh-uh.
You know what you see.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.723
That is exactly why he's listed
in my "If I Go Missing" kit.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.558
- What's an
"If I Go Missing" kit?

05:25.592 --> 05:27.927
- So it is a kit that
you make for the police

05:27.961 --> 05:29.062
in case you go missing.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.531
And inside it has
all your passwords,

05:31.564 --> 05:34.467
your DNA, a recent photo
of you for the news,

05:34.501 --> 05:38.071
and a list of men you think
might wanna kill or kidnap you.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.639
Every lady needs one.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.174
- Except me
because I'm microchipped.

05:41.207 --> 05:45.011
However, I did make
a "If Durbin Goes Missing" kit.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.847
And just for your information,
it is in this drawer here.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.049
And it is always locked.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.184
Nope.
Not locked.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.719
All right.
Let me show you.

05:52.752 --> 05:53.853
all: Ooh.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.889
Very top secret.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.491
I've got a blood sample.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.660
I won't tell you what hole
that came out of.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.529
- Michelle, the point is

06:02.562 --> 06:04.931
you needed a kit
like yesterday, okay?

06:04.964 --> 06:06.733
Like, watch a "Dateline."

06:09.469 --> 06:11.037
- Well.
Kiddos.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.040
This weekend, I crapped out
a Robin Schwonk novel.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.209
[laughs]

06:16.242 --> 06:18.611
- Uh, all due respect, boss.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.580
Robin Schwonk doesn't
use ghost writers.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.182
- Well, this is
a one-time thing, Heather.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.484
He's in a dark place right now.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.519
Apparently his dog.
has Psoriasis

06:26.553 --> 06:28.188
- Millie?
Oh, no.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.222

your draft of "Disgraced."

06:39.099 --> 06:40.600
- You did?
Great.

[mouthing words]

06:42.035 --> 06:43.236
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.805
- No let me ask you something.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.241
Do you like messing with me?

06:48.274 --> 06:52.178
'Cause I just finished wiping
my ass with that pile of shit.

Let's fix this.
Okay, bud?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.610
<i>Okay.</i>

- Oh--
<i>[call disconnects]</i>

07:26.246 --> 07:27.981
Well.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.517
There's eight hours of work
down the drain.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.025
- So he hated it, huh?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.294
Well you did say you
crapped it out, so,

07:41.327 --> 07:43.830
you know, that had me worried
since Jump Street.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.266
- Marcus, go stick your hand
in the window sill.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.968
Dan, slam the window down on it
as hard as you can.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.637
- Okay, you know
I can't do that, Mr. G.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.905
- Come on, boss.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.107
You gotta have thick skin
in the writing biz.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.577
I have had ten stories rejected
by the "Whitlock Gazette,"

07:57.610 --> 07:59.713
And I'm
"friends with the editor."

07:59.746 --> 08:00.780
- I told you.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.682
We don't publish
mature content.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.850
- [sighs]
Fact.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.852
Two of the greatest minds
on the planet,

08:05.885 --> 08:07.921
Schwonk and Griffin,
are teaming up.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.557
And I, Heather Marie Willmore,

08:10.590 --> 08:13.093
will be able to help them both.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.128
We can fix this, comrade.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.830
Let's do it for Millie.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.131
- Who's Mille again?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.200
- That's Schwonk's
Psoriasis dog.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.837
- I think the millionaire's
ashy bitch is gonna be okay.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.639
- I have Psoriasis,
but no one's worried about me.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.710
You all won't even look at me!

[bell rings]

17:14.801 --> 17:16.236
- Oh!

17:16.269 --> 17:19.139
- We out-Schwonk-ed
Schwonk last night.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.442
- We planted passages from
my book into his manuscript.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.611
So as soon as he goes to print,
we'll expose him.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.280
- Mr. Griffin's name
will be everywhere.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.249
His book will fly
off the shelves.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.684
- [chuckles]

17:30.717 --> 17:32.452
- Well there's not really
a market for philosophy books.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.121
If anything, Malcolm Gladwell's
sociology books

17:35.155 --> 17:36.322
kind of scratch that itch,

17:36.356 --> 17:38.324
but maybe I'm just

17:38.358 --> 17:40.226
an outlier.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.595
- Anyone--can anyone please

17:42.629 --> 17:44.898
slam Marcus's fingers
into the window sill?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.266
- Maybe I could.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.235
- Looks like you guys
have reached your

17:49.269 --> 17:50.303
tipping point.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.839
- Oh.
- [sighs]

17:52.872 --> 17:54.240
[phone ringing]
- Oh.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.308
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.409
Wait.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.877
Ugh, it's Schwonk.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.379
Um--
- Oh, put it on speaker.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
- Yeah
Okay.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.250
Ugh.
All right.

<i>- Hey, Jack.</i>

Great news.

You passed the test.
You won.

<i>- Everything.</i>

18:11.691 --> 18:13.393

18:13.426 --> 18:14.861

Wow, this took a weird turn.

<i>- You're gonna write</i>

18:22.969 --> 18:25.238

<i>- What I'm about to do,</i>

19:13.620 --> 19:16.356
Adam was as gracious

his legacy of musc--

19:18.758 --> 19:19.926

I didn't think you would

19:42.382 --> 19:44.351
But how did you do it?

19:44.384 --> 19:45.919
- Well, I asked Ms. Damarcus

19:45.952 --> 19:47.587
for my homeroom
attendance folder,

19:47.620 --> 19:49.489
and she gave me this.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.524
It has, like,
all of your passwords in it.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.560
- [gasps]
God.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.694
It's all my fault.

19:54.728 --> 19:55.929
- I'm so sorry, it's just--

19:55.962 --> 19:58.698
my mom won't let me go on the
Ohio Naturalists field trip.

19:58.732 --> 20:00.567
And Mr. Pugh lets
boys and girls sleep together

20:00.600 --> 20:01.901
in the same lodge.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.503
And you can zip your
sleeping bag up with a girl.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.871
And if I don't go,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.040
Eduardo might zip his
sleeping bag up with Grace's!

20:07.073 --> 20:08.641
- Oh, my God.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.011
I didn't know Mr. Pugh
allowed teenage co-bagging.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.879
That trip is cancelled!

20:12.912 --> 20:15.815
- [laughs]
What an elegant solution.

20:15.849 --> 20:17.384

20:17.417 --> 20:20.286
Anyway, we cool?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.398
Look--look what
Robin Schwonk sent.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.799
His--his book came out.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.035
So, you know, he sent us
a gift package.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.872
He also texted me a, uh,
picture of his boat.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.008
It said, "Feel free to use
the yacht anytime, Jackie.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.677
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!"

20:43.710 --> 20:45.545

the plagiarism.

notice how the murderer talks?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.652
- Hm?

20:52.686 --> 20:54.320
- I wrapped my hands
around his neck.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.356
He pleaded, "Help me, God."

20:56.389 --> 20:58.358
I sneered, "God is a construct

"that the minutia
