01:10.336 --> 01:12.337
( <i>slurping</i>)

01:12.339 --> 01:15.741
So, how much does a piece
of ice like that go for?

01:15.743 --> 01:16.909
The Kimber Diamond

01:16.911 --> 01:19.178
is the most flawless
gem in the world.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.613
Its value is beyond

01:21.615 --> 01:24.083
I'm going to throw
out a number... 250 bucks.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.684
Sir, I really don't think...

01:25.686 --> 01:26.685
$275!

Am I getting warmer?

Cool.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.955
What-what
is it?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.356
WADE:
<i>Hair.</i>

01:31.358 --> 01:33.058
Canine hair,
but not just any dog.

01:33.060 --> 01:36.028
This follicle comes
from a Lithuanian wolfhound,

01:36.030 --> 01:38.997
one of the rarest
breeds on earth.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.900
And what would one of these dogs
want with a diamond?

01:41.902 --> 01:43.735
Why don't we focus
on the person

01:43.737 --> 01:45.003
who owns the dog, Ron?

01:45.005 --> 01:46.839
That's just what
the dog burglar

01:46.841 --> 01:48.040
wants you to do.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.141
WADE:
Got it.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.143
Falsetto Jones, the only breeder

01:51.145 --> 01:53.745
of Lithuanian wolfhounds
in the world.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.381
He's rich, refined and possibly
the world's greatest thief.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.118
Falsetto is
the number one suspect

01:59.120 --> 02:01.420
in a lot of big-time robberies,

02:01.422 --> 02:03.455
but they can never
pin anything on him.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.891
So, he's no ordinary
cat burglar...

02:05.893 --> 02:06.892
Dog burglar!

02:06.894 --> 02:08.060
Come on, Kim,

02:08.062 --> 02:12.865
WADE: <i>Bad news... his estate

<i>Falsetto hosts his annual</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:18.170

02:18.172 --> 02:20.639
So all we need to get inside...

02:20.641 --> 02:22.007
is a show dog.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.842
Yes, my Gigi has

a <i>très sensitiv</i> tummy,

02:26.013 --> 02:27.913
Now, you must remember

Two parts wet, one part dry,

02:39.760 --> 02:40.893
Got it.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.294
Two parts wet, one part dry.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.395
Two parts wet...

02:45.799 --> 02:47.399
No!

02:48.201 --> 02:50.002
No. Gigi, bad.

all the time.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.986
He's cool.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.156
News flash, Ron...
Rufus is a rat,

03:11.158 --> 03:13.158
not a champion show dog

03:13.160 --> 03:15.127
( <i>sputtering</i> )

03:15.129 --> 03:18.230
Gigi is in no condition
to enter a dog show

03:18.232 --> 03:19.865
and we land in 15.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.966

You're gonna have to look dog,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.115

04:06.480 --> 04:08.981
I'm sorry, what breed
did you say this was?

04:08.983 --> 04:10.782
Um, a... Peruvian...

04:10.784 --> 04:11.984
Hairless.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.420
Huh?

04:16.222 --> 04:17.923
I'm still not seeing anything

04:17.925 --> 04:19.291
here in the official...

04:19.293 --> 04:21.260
Maybe you should consult
with my friend Mr. Lincoln.

your eyesight a bit,

catch my drift.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.098
Ron.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.834
This is a prestigious
international competition.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.302
And I'm speaking
the prestigious

04:30.304 --> 04:32.271
international language
of cold, hard cash.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.406

he's called "Falsetto"?

humans and canines alike

I need time

05:00.434 --> 05:02.234
to infiltrate the main house.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.036
Try to keep a low profile.

You got it. Low pro.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.841
Good dog.

I'm liking
the stealth suit, Wade.

Knew you would, Kim.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.396
And the pond is filled with...

Don't tell me. Sharks? Crocs?

05:33.133 --> 05:34.533
Electric eels, actually.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.036
The bad-villain puns
just write themselves.

that kind of spirit
in such a small dog.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.168
Of course, there's
a time for spirit

It's quite an upset.

And he'll move on to the finals.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.184
Who's the dog!

If I were a flawless diamond,
where would I hide?

of vault deep under the house.

Oh, that's quite an animal
you have there, Mr...?

07:32.719 --> 07:36.221
The name's Van Foker Dumple
( <i>coughs</i> ) Stein.

07:36.223 --> 07:40.258
<i>Doctor</i> Van Foker Dumple
( <i>coughs</i> ) Stein, actually.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.360
Funny, in all my years
of hosting this show,

07:42.362 --> 07:44.329
I've never
seen anything quite like him.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.998
Well, as I'm sure you know,
the Groovy Hairless...

07:47.000 --> 07:47.999
Peruvian Hairless?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.634
Yes! He's practically

07:49.636 --> 07:51.036
one of a kind.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.238
I feel compelled
to ask you a question,

Dr. Foker Dumple
( <i>coughs</i>) Stein

07:55.042 --> 07:57.008
Fire away.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.176
Can I have your autograph?

07:58.178 --> 08:02.214
Hey. Sure. Anything for a fan.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.348
Not your autograph,

His.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.650
Ah. Mine.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.597
And Bingo was his name-o.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.705
Hello, beautiful.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.609
Sorry, KP.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.278
The low-profile thing
didn't exactly work out.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.413
He's a naked mole rat.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.382
Purchased at the
Middleton Smarty Mart

08:37.384 --> 08:40.285
by Mr. Ron Stoppable, sidekick
to teen hero Kim Possible.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.320
I ran a check on his autograph.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.692
Feed that useless rat
to my beloved wolfhounds.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.097
I have a special treat

I think you'll
find this quite shocking.

Aren't you going to leave now?

Oh, usually the bad guy

says his lame pun
and then walks out,

09:55.796 --> 09:57.362
you know,
leaving us to our doom.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.097
But then I'd miss
the whole thing.

Where's the fun in that?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.232
I'm not going anywhere.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.834
Okay, but I feel
I must warn you,

So not.

Okay, you can hit the button

Sorry, no parachute.

No parachute?!

11:19.412 --> 11:20.712
Hit it, Sam.

The Peruvian Hairless
saves the day.

Rufus is definitely

best in show.
