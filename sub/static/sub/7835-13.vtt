00:17.017 --> 00:18.017
What the...

00:30.948 --> 00:33.783
Honey, I've got some bad news for you.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.994
Not now, Marge. I'm waiting
for the new XFL season!

00:37.079 --> 00:39.872
Who will win this year's
million-dollar game?

00:39.957 --> 00:41.374
Who? Who?

00:41.458 --> 00:42.458
Honey.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.335
The "X" is for "Extreme. "

00:44.420 --> 00:47.380
There is no XFL this year.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.673
The league folded.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.009
Who told you?

00:52.094 --> 00:53.594
Last year's MVP.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.597
He sweeps up toenails
at the beauty parlor.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.851
Hello? Hello.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.729
This is the Springfield
Retirement Castle.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.813
Your parent...

01:03.897 --> 01:05.440
Abraham Simpson.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.650
...is dead. Oh, my God!

01:08.485 --> 01:09.736
He died from...

01:09.820 --> 01:12.113
Complications of a medical nature.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.742
The nursing home was not responsible.

01:16.452 --> 01:19.287
Homer, your father's dead.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.917
And he never even
lived to be a vegetable.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.424
I'm really gonna miss him.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.343
It's Grampa's smell.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.099
Oh, my dad never even
knew how I felt about him.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.102
But you were very open
with your feelings.

01:43.187 --> 01:47.815
Sure, I said I loved him, but
never that I was in love with him.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.860
What are you crying about?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.779
You don't have to live here.

01:52.863 --> 01:53.863
Dad!

01:53.947 --> 01:55.323
Grampa! Grampa!

01:55.407 --> 01:58.242
Stop it! You're stretching out my skin.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.622
What's got into you punks?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.665
The home told us you were dead.

02:04.750 --> 02:09.711
Me? I ain't dead. It was
Stamson down the hall.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.757
So much for Mr. I Can
Button My Own Shirt.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.176
Oh, Dad.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.514
We've got what people
never get. A second chance.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.475
Yeah, there's so many things we can...

02:22.559 --> 02:26.395
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll
call you or send you some fruit.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.357
Look, Grampa. You're already
getting a new neighbor.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.486
Hi. I'm Zelda. I put the
"ass" in assisted living.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.321
Holy mac...

02:37.074 --> 02:39.909
Abe Simpson's the name,
and now that you're here,

02:39.993 --> 02:44.080
I'm changing my instructions
to "do resuscitate. "

02:44.957 --> 02:48.125
Now, let me show you around.
Over there are the preppies...

02:49.294 --> 02:54.131
And over there's the comatose,
and the cool comatose.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.344
Hey, who's the tall drink of Maalox?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.556
Are you young ladies here
to visit your mothers?

03:02.933 --> 03:08.062
Eh, that's Zack. He's as
smooth as a 50-year-old behind.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.232
Who wants to go get some
sweet corn in my minivan?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.484
It's got a wheelchair lift.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.698
If you can drive, they're all over you.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.076
I used to drive, but
they pulled my license.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.878
Is this the Dairy Queen?

03:37.593 --> 03:41.429
But Zelda, if you're looking
for something with a big backseat

03:41.513 --> 03:45.141
and a lot of gas, I'm your man.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.684
Oh!

03:47.102 --> 03:48.769
You've never heard Garrison Keillor

03:48.854 --> 03:51.522
till you've heard him
through five speakers.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.691
Tramp.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.818
B-6.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.446
You sunk my Scrabbleship.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.239
This game makes no sense.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.284
Tell that to the good men
who just lost their lives.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.702
Semper Fi.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.913
I want to drive again!

04:06.997 --> 04:09.665
You? No way! It's too dangerous.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.836
Well, you're no angel behind
the wheel. What about your DUl?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.464
That was a DWI!

04:16.673 --> 04:18.007
Give Grampa a chance.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.926
Statistics show that old people drive

04:20.010 --> 04:21.886
at least as well as
sleep-deprived apes.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.849
Please, Son. Driving is my
last chance to feel alive.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.853
Well, you brought me
into this world, so no!

04:31.688 --> 04:33.689
Fine. I'm dead.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.692
Dad, get up.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.944
No, I'm dead.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.487
Grampa, come on.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.613
Dead!

04:40.697 --> 04:44.033
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!

04:44.451 --> 04:48.329
All right, Grampa. I'll help
you get your license back.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.957
Woo-hoo! And I want driving gloves.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.041
No way!

04:52.125 --> 04:55.294
Dead, dead, dead, dead!

05:00.342 --> 05:03.719
First of all, I'd like to ask
if anyone has any questions.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.221
Yeah. Where's the men's room?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.014
It's down the hall.

05:08.892 --> 05:12.311
Okay. Now, let's pretend
that we're going for a drive.

05:14.231 --> 05:18.234
Leo, slow down. That looks
like a nice place to eat.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.528
Carla's daughter works in that building.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.154
You know, it's kind of ironic.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.115
These old people are being kept alive

05:24.199 --> 05:26.534
by the organs of the
young people they ran over.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.077
Makes you think, huh, Chief?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.203
Not really.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.205
Next!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.541
Grampa's here to get
his driver's license.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.752
Okay. Look at the eye chart
and cover your left eye.

05:36.837 --> 05:41.465
That's my seeing eye. The
right one's my winking eye.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.429
I'll give you your license
if you never do that again.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.432
Oh, everything's the
last time I do everything.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.768
Can't you just use this recent photo?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.814
Mmm. All right.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.608
Here you go.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.776
Woo-hoo!

06:01.987 --> 06:03.988
Who's laughing now?

06:06.158 --> 06:07.158
Shut up!

06:14.791 --> 06:17.001
What's the scoop, milkshakes?

06:17.669 --> 06:20.713
I got me a date with
Zelda, so I need the car.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.633
Oh, no. I'm not giving you my
car. You'd probably drive it.

06:25.427 --> 06:29.722
You don't trust your old
man? You ungrateful milkshake.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.265
Why don't we double-date?

06:31.349 --> 06:34.268
Then the restaurant will
have to give us that booth.

06:34.352 --> 06:38.439
Wow, a booth. If I'm
tired, I can just lie down.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.739
Cut it out! I can work the brake myself.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.491
No, you can't.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.702
You're slow to react, Dad.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.413
Baloney!

06:54.873 --> 06:57.917
This is the best party of my life.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.669
Bro, you tapped the septic tank.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.173
Dude sure got his comeuppance.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.551
In real life, he would die.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.597
Oh, Abe. Oh, Zelda.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.225
Hey, watch the movie.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.478
Movies were better in our day.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.689
For a nickel you got
two movies, a cartoon,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.983
a bag of popcorn and a whipping.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.027
Kept your mind on your business.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.072
Hop in, beautiful.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.912
'Cause every girl's crazy
'bout a sharp dressed man

07:38.708 --> 07:42.795
Now, there's a few things
I want to say to you, Zelda.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.297
Save your breath. Seriously.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.051
Well, I gotta do something
before the Viagra kicks in.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.679
I know. I'll suck my teeth.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.016
Whoa! Here we go.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.319
Give me those keys!

08:07.404 --> 08:09.446
Do you have any idea
what you put us through?

08:09.531 --> 08:13.367
I called the police, the
hospital, my bookie, the kennel...

08:13.577 --> 08:15.703
Okay, this isn't about who I called.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.913
See you later. I'm going to the library.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.876
Lisa gets to do what she wants
and you don't yell at her.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.253
Hey, I've earned their trust.

08:24.504 --> 08:30.801
Oh! Everybody trusts Lisa. Precious
little Lisa. Apple of her daddy's eye.

08:31.094 --> 08:35.014
Lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay
out all night with some hoochie.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.725
She's no hoochie.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.269
Her name is Zelda and
she understands me.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.772
Grampa, I gotta tell you,
she's a stone-cold hoochie.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.193
Straight up, Marge. That hoochie
only likes you because you can drive.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.404
Shut up! You don't know
her! Zelda loves me!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.907
I hate this house!

09:00.790 --> 09:03.459
Turn that down! You call that music?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.712
I just don't know what to do.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.797
He used to be such an angel.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.133
Maybe you should give
him another chance.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.845
No. He's gotta learn, Marge.
The way my dad made me learn.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.597
He is your dad.

09:17.849 --> 09:18.891
Cosmic.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.063
Hey, Abe, what are you doing here?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.482
We heard you lost your
driving privileges.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.319
Well, for your information, I
can still drive to the store,

09:30.403 --> 09:33.572
but I have to be back in five minutes
with these things for the baby.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.911
Oh, Gentlemen, the new
scratch-and-win tickets are out today.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.913
I'll take one, Achu.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.831
No, not "chu," "pu. "

09:43.416 --> 09:44.792
I got troubles with both.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.421
Finally the shakes are working for me.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.923
Pardon me, sir.

09:51.216 --> 09:55.094
Your scrapings have landed on my
jacket from Planet Hollywood, Orlando.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.387
So, what if it did?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.514
So, it is very thoughtless.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.309
I should cut you like I
cut sodium out of my diet.

10:02.477 --> 10:07.064
You don't scare me with your
dignity and your subtle cologne.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.775
Then perhaps you should
be taught a lesson by us,

10:09.859 --> 10:12.361
Los Souvenir Jacquitos!

10:13.738 --> 10:15.155
Bring it on.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.702
Please, gentlemen.
Violence is not the answer.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.120
Then what is?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.538
Some sort of death race?

10:22.664 --> 10:23.664
That's what I would do.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.457
Very well, Viejo.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.918
You shall have your death race.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.838
Death race?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.966
And another thing. No death races.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.510
Oh, I better not.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.851
Fine! I'll meet you at
the abandoned aqueduct.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.352
For the death race?

10:45.437 --> 10:46.603
Yes, the death race.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.400
All right, seniors and seÃ±ores,

10:51.901 --> 10:55.779
whichever car makes it through
that tunnel first is the winner.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.157
But it's only big enough for one car.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.159
What are you scared of, old man?

11:00.243 --> 11:04.705
Everything. Dogs, Dutchmen,
the gathering darkness.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.958
All right. When I yank down
my girlfriend's tube top,

11:08.043 --> 11:09.793
the race will begin.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.756
What? I'm just trying to
bring you into my world.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.090
Just go.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.573
Old friend, your jacket, she burns.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.116
Then I burn with her,

11:41.451 --> 11:44.036
for I would rather die
than have people not know

11:44.120 --> 11:45.829
what stores I have been to.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.791
Whoo-hoo!

11:49.292 --> 11:52.211
We're the baddest punks
in our age bracket!

12:09.229 --> 12:11.397
My beard. I broke my beard.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.651
Oh, my God! We can't let Homer know.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.496
Oh! That is it! Abraham J. Simpson,

12:27.914 --> 12:32.292
you are never driving again! Ever!

12:35.672 --> 12:38.882
I can't believe I cracked
up my only set of wheels.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.803
Go home!

12:45.640 --> 12:49.143
Put on a smile, high-pants.
I've got a surprise for you.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.020
I've booked us a room for the
weekend in Branson, Missouri.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.897
The Gritz Carlton Hotel.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.109
Oh! That's great, but
there's a slight hitch.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.571
You see, I'm temporarily between cars.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.909
But we don't need anything
to have fun but ourselves.

13:06.536 --> 13:11.206
Give me that old time fun
Give me that old time fun

13:11.291 --> 13:15.294
Give me that old time fun

13:15.378 --> 13:17.880
The kind where we stay home

13:18.173 --> 13:20.632
Zelda, may I offer you a lift?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.511
No!

13:26.556 --> 13:28.390
Don't feel bad, Abe.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.768
I'll always think of you
as my friend without a car.

13:32.896 --> 13:37.024
Don't go, Zelda! I love you!

13:37.400 --> 13:42.321
Zelda, I'm gonna make you
forget about your grandchildren.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.326
Oh, what'll I do?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.415
Hey, Grampa. Stealing Mom's car?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.667
Yeah, it's the only
way to win back Zelda.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.670
And if I go to prison, I'll
get better food and more hugs.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.007
Uh, it's actually blue
wire to yellow wire.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.258
It is?

14:05.303 --> 14:07.429
Hot diggety Dodge!

14:07.972 --> 14:10.724
Next stop, Branson, Missouri!

14:10.808 --> 14:11.850
Can I tag along?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.769
Sure, why not? School ain't helping you.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.147
Born to be wild

14:20.151 --> 14:22.402
Oh, I hate this hippie crap.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.198
And now, WOMB, warm and safe radio,

14:26.533 --> 14:30.035
takes you back to the
golden age of radio theater.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.496
It's The Itchy and Scratchy Hour,

14:32.580 --> 14:34.915
presented by Hansen's Moustache Wax,

14:35.250 --> 14:38.085
the moustache wax Hitler doesn't use.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.880
They Fight, and Bite They
Fight and Fight and Bite

14:41.965 --> 14:46.385
Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite,
bite The Itchy and Scratchy Show

14:46.469 --> 14:48.220
As we join tonight's adventure,

14:48.304 --> 14:51.473
we find Itchy at the
counter of his butcher shop.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.685
Hiya, Scratchy.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.731
You're crushing my head!

15:02.944 --> 15:06.405
During the war, Eleanor Roosevelt
was the voice of Scratchy.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.948
The lady knows funny.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.703
First he wrecks your
car, then he steals mine.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.788
Your father's out of control.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.584
Oh, sure, when he does
something bad, he's my father.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.002
He must've dropped this.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.381
We've gotta go after them!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.549
But how?

15:25.633 --> 15:29.261
Branson is a thousand miles
away, and we've got no car.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.307
Oh! That was lucky.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.474
Come on, boys.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.938
Uh, we'll wait for the next one.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.775
What are those, Grampa?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.694
These are hobo signs.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.364
They're to tell other hobos
if a place is friendly or not.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.327
That one means good
vittles. Sexy daughter.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.121
Mass hobo grave in cellar.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.258
Here we are. Branson, Missouri.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.969
No, pally. This is Bronson, Missouri.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.971
Mmm. Hey.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.641
Well, how do we get to Branson?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.100
Number 10 bus.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.853
Hey, Ma, how about some cookies?

16:19.937 --> 16:20.979
No dice.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.230
This ain't over.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.150
There it is!

16:25.234 --> 16:28.028
That's the glitziest
"Welcome To" sign ever!

16:30.907 --> 16:31.907
Whoa!

16:37.455 --> 16:39.623
Okay, keep an eye peeled for Zelda.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.460
Is that her? No.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.337
Is that her? No!

16:45.421 --> 16:46.505
Wait. It was the second one.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.591
Zelda, baby, it's me!

16:50.593 --> 16:52.302
Two seniors, please.

16:52.387 --> 16:56.765
Oh, no! He's taking her to
the hottest matinee in town.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.935
Come on, boy. After them!

17:10.029 --> 17:13.573
Remember the stars you loved yesterday

17:13.907 --> 17:16.952
Where did they go?
Did they all pass away?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.705
Was it drugs or a car crash
Or facelift gone wrong?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.958
No, they're right here in Branson

17:23.041 --> 17:30.006
And singing this song

17:30.633 --> 17:33.885
My name is Charo I shake my maracas

17:37.473 --> 17:41.059
Remember me, fool? I was B. A. Baracus

17:45.106 --> 17:48.400
We're the performers
You thought were dead

17:48.484 --> 17:52.154
Like Bonnie Franklin and Adrian Zmed

17:52.405 --> 17:55.532
Branson's the place
We can always be found

17:55.616 --> 17:59.578
They took Nick at
Nite And made it a town

18:03.416 --> 18:06.626
You can call me Ray
Or you can call me Jay

18:06.919 --> 18:10.172
Just don't call me washed
up I do three shows a day

18:13.050 --> 18:15.552
Charlie Callas doesn't
sleep in the ground

18:15.636 --> 18:19.389
Yes, I'm still alive
And I'm making my sounds

18:24.020 --> 18:28.732
So sit back, relax And watch our revue

18:29.025 --> 18:31.359
In Soviet Union

18:31.903 --> 18:36.364
Revue watches you

18:38.701 --> 18:42.204
Tennessee Ernie Ford?
Now, I know you're dead.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.664
No. You just think I'm dead.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.751
No, you're dead. I was your biggest fan.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.586
Look, I clipped your obituary.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.263
Let's take a quick gambling break.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.141
A little action will
really sharpen our senses.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.185
Mom, there's no gambling in Branson.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.854
It was designed as a family destination.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.981
Oh, no, there's gambling.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.149
We just have to find it!

19:11.234 --> 19:12.984
Look, Mom, it's your car.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.320
Grampa and Bart must be in that theater.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.656
Bet you they're not. Three
to one. How much you got?

19:17.740 --> 19:19.533
Mom, you're hurting me.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.661
Grampa, look over there.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.038
It's Captain Bringdown
and The Buzzkillers.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.457
If you're gonna make your
move, you better do it quick.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.583
Mmm...

19:31.170 --> 19:33.171
Wait! Stop the music!

19:34.465 --> 19:35.799
A
- ha! Oh!

19:36.050 --> 19:38.093
It's Grampa! Munster?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.344
No, Simpson.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.097
Oh, darn, darn, darn!

19:43.599 --> 19:47.561
I've driven hundreds of miles
to say something very special

19:47.728 --> 19:50.230
to someone in this audience tonight.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.690
Aw!

19:51.774 --> 19:52.774
Huh?

19:53.234 --> 19:55.527
Zelda, will you come up here?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.241
Drive me, Abe. Drive me.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.452
I just want to say we're through!

20:04.954 --> 20:08.623
Nobody dumps Abe Simpson.
You're nothing but a hoochie.

20:09.125 --> 20:14.921
Hoochie, hoochie, hoochie!

20:17.383 --> 20:20.260
Now I'd like my son to come up here.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.682
Son, can you forgive an old fool?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.350
Only in public.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.602
Oh!

20:28.686 --> 20:29.895
Aw!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.064
Now, let's go home.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.488
In Russia, stage is for performers only.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.272
Hey!

21:29.372 --> 21:32.248
This has been a Gracie
Films presentation!
