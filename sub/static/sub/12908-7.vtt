My ex-girlfriend is marrying
my new business partner.

00:05.312 --> 00:06.148
Okay.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.820
I thought she was in a mental
institution in Oklahoma.

00:07.845 --> 00:09.117
I'm with someone I love.

This man that I met
at Jennifer's game night

00:13.398 --> 00:15.049

- Yikes.

00:15.074 --> 00:16.166
But not for therapy.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.241
- I think just to flirt.
- Come in.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.493
Spencer's gone back into treatment.

00:20.494 --> 00:21.953
It would be nice if some of you

00:21.954 --> 00:23.913
could put together
a care package for him.

00:23.914 --> 00:25.081

00:28.752 --> 00:29.961
You have plans this weekend?

00:29.962 --> 00:31.212
- Nothin' really.
- No?

00:31.213 --> 00:32.464

- I've already informed Jordan.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.474

00:42.475 --> 00:43.914
Stop trying to make me jealous.

00:43.939 --> 00:45.242
I'm not that girl anymore

00:45.267 --> 00:46.979
and nothing you do
is gonna bring her back.

00:47.723 --> 00:49.137
Holy shit. It worked.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.234
Uh-huh.

00:53.235 --> 00:55.069
Mm-hmm.

00:56.155 --> 00:57.447
Not bad.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.407
Waze or unnecessary eye contact?

00:59.408 --> 01:01.618
- Ah, the Walter White joke.
- Yeah, there was a...

01:01.619 --> 01:03.703

01:03.704 --> 01:05.997
Little dated, but it plays.

Oh, right.

Have you made plans with him?

01:19.678 --> 01:21.763
Nope. Just playing it by ear.

01:21.764 --> 01:23.973
- You've come so far.
- Thank you.

01:26.727 --> 01:30.480
Uh, I'm sure he's fine.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.481
Who's Harry?

01:31.482 --> 01:32.524
Some doctor my mom slept with.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.234
- Laura...
- And this is...

01:34.235 --> 01:35.985

23:08.986 --> 23:12.114
Okay, uh, what about kissing?

23:12.115 --> 23:16.868
I like kissing.

23:16.869 --> 23:18.370
You okay?

23:18.371 --> 23:20.163
Oh.

23:20.164 --> 23:23.166
First-time jitters. That's all.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.626
We can slow down, if you want.

23:24.627 --> 23:26.336
No, it's...

23:26.337 --> 23:31.133

24:52.757 --> 24:54.549
It's the "My So-Called Life"
of your generation.

24:54.550 --> 24:56.092
Come on. "Welcome to the O.C., bitch"?

24:56.093 --> 24:57.469
Yeah, one of the best sentences

24:57.470 --> 24:58.595
ever uttered on television.

24:58.596 --> 24:59.721
Mm-hmm.

24:59.722 --> 25:01.640
I guess I remember the music.

25:01.641 --> 25:02.933
Yeah, Death Cab.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.434
"One guitar and a lot of complaining."

25:04.435 --> 25:06.519
Hey, that's a quote. Summer. Summer!

25:06.520 --> 25:07.771
Tijuana episode!

25:07.772 --> 25:10.148
Yes. Oh, my God, you are good.

25:10.149 --> 25:12.734
- You are very good.
- Hey, remember Caleb's funeral?

25:12.735 --> 25:15.779
That Imogen Heap song juxtaposed
with, you know the dark...

25:15.780 --> 25:18.406
I'm gonna hit the dessert table.

25:18.407 --> 25:20.033
Um, me too.

25:24.163 --> 25:26.206
Really? "The O.C."?

25:26.207 --> 25:28.083
I haven't watched that trash
since middle school.

25:28.084 --> 25:29.626
You're really making me work here.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.044
I'm making you work? I hated that show.

25:31.045 --> 25:32.295
You could have fooled me.

25:32.296 --> 25:33.588
Tighten up, will you?

25:33.589 --> 25:35.882
Your performance is all over the place.

25:35.883 --> 25:37.050
You... what?

25:37.051 --> 25:38.802
Your little act for Sarah.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.553
No, it's not an act.

25:40.554 --> 25:41.888
- I'm not doing an act.
- It's fine. It's fine.

25:41.889 --> 25:43.265
I'm doing the same thing with Jordan.

25:43.266 --> 25:44.599
Well, trying, but it's impossible

25:44.600 --> 25:45.725
with you going all Jekyll and Hyde.

25:45.726 --> 25:47.519
Just even out. Find a rhythm.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.104
You can't only be into me
when Sarah's watching.

25:49.105 --> 25:50.397
You're noting me? Wait, what?

25:50.398 --> 25:52.649
What? You and Jordan?

25:52.650 --> 25:54.985
Yes, we've been emotionally
involved for months.

25:54.986 --> 25:56.236
You're using me?

25:56.237 --> 25:58.321
Dude, we are using each other.

25:58.322 --> 25:59.739
Did you really not get that?

25:59.740 --> 26:01.950
We had sex in my office.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.243
And?

26:03.244 --> 26:05.370
Oh, my God. You're hilarious.

26:05.371 --> 26:07.539
Fallon.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.959
May I speak with you
for a moment, please?

26:10.960 --> 26:22.053
Of course.

26:22.054 --> 26:24.264
What is wrong with you?

26:24.265 --> 26:25.682
What would you like to do next?

26:25.683 --> 26:26.891
Would you like to,
perhaps, make a toast,

26:26.892 --> 26:29.936
or join us on our honeymoon?

26:29.937 --> 26:32.188
I asked you to stop.

26:32.189 --> 26:34.274
I asked you. Stay away from me.

26:34.275 --> 26:36.443
It isn't fair.

26:36.444 --> 26:38.278
I moved forward. I moved past you,
