on the right,

Suddenly, this guy shows up.

00:15.865 --> 00:17.132
<i>(Santa ♪2) Hey, you don't own
this corner. I got a charity too.</i>

00:17.166 --> 00:19.534

I'm not gonna start now.

00:27.543 --> 00:28.944
Are you kidding me?

All right, fine.
Come here, buddy.

[Yells]

00:32.180 --> 00:34.416
Hey, hey, hey!

00:37.120 --> 00:38.086
Hit him in his fat
cherry cheeks.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.888
Ooh!

00:39.889 --> 00:41.123
Ugh, that felt wrong.

<i>Knife!</i>

Ahh!

That's right. Boom!

Your egg sandwich fell
on the floor

01:20.730 --> 01:21.997

No. Can you do that?

02:17.453 --> 02:19.254
I really came in here

Captains receive meaningless
threats all the time.

02:21.524 --> 02:23.391

Of course, totally.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.194
I mean, why would a death threat
be a big deal?

02:26.195 --> 02:27.696
Oh, that's right.
'Cause it threatens death.

02:27.730 --> 02:28.830
It's a hoax.

that Captain Holt
have a security detail with him

02:41.277 --> 02:42.711

Interesting.

02:45.848 --> 02:48.350
And not at all surprising.
I'm his favorite.

02:48.384 --> 02:50.452
Tell me, what would
this job entail?

02:50.486 --> 02:52.521
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt.
Uh-huh.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.790
You'll be entirely in control
of his movements. Amazing.

02:54.791 --> 02:56.825
He will not leave your sight.

Oh, well, it sounds
really tough,

03:04.534 --> 03:05.934

03:05.935 --> 03:08.336

my life at risk for this man

03:08.371 --> 03:09.671

all of my orders.

03:09.672 --> 03:11.106

Hey, my flight
is at 8:00 tonight.

03:16.012 --> 03:17.579
It's domestic.

03:17.580 --> 03:20.081
You think I'll be safe if I get
to the airport five hours early?

03:20.082 --> 03:21.817
Five?
No way!

03:21.818 --> 03:23.552
You gotta do seven.
Seven minimum.

03:23.586 --> 03:24.920
Seven. I knew it.
Yep.

03:24.921 --> 03:26.788
Why are you going
on a singles cruise?

03:26.789 --> 03:27.956
I thought
you were into Rosa.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.424
Well, I am.

03:29.425 --> 03:31.760
But I've begun to feel
like there's a slight chance

03:31.761 --> 03:33.461
Rosa may not love me back.

03:33.496 --> 03:35.030
Hey, how about we grab
some dinner tonight,

03:35.064 --> 03:36.198
just you and me?

03:36.232 --> 03:38.200
That's nice,
and I like you as a person,

03:38.201 --> 03:39.801
but I'm just not interested
in you...

03:39.802 --> 03:41.369
Romantically.

03:41.404 --> 03:42.571
Coolio!

03:42.605 --> 03:44.739
Hey, what say you
we grab a drink?

03:44.774 --> 03:46.174
You're starting
to make this weird.

03:46.175 --> 03:48.243
I'm not into you that way,
and I have a boyfriend.

03:48.277 --> 03:50.188
Got you.
Rain check.

03:50.213 --> 03:52.214
A rose... for Rosa.

03:52.215 --> 03:53.448
Listen to me!

03:53.449 --> 03:56.751
The healthy thing for you
to do is move on.

03:56.752 --> 03:59.421
So we both decided
the healthy thing for me to do

03:59.422 --> 04:02.257
is to just move on.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.092
I'm impressed, Charles.
That's very mature.

04:04.126 --> 04:05.360
Thanks.
You know what's funny?

04:05.361 --> 04:07.696
I realized I sometimes...
Oh, no, don't get comfy.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.370
This wasn't an invitation
to keep talking.

04:09.398 --> 04:10.665
Gotcha.
Rain check on the convo.

04:10.666 --> 04:12.434
Yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.502
Peralta's busy,
so let's just get started.

04:14.537 --> 04:16.303
<i>Now, the Captain won't allow us
to give him</i>

04:16.339 --> 04:17.639
all the presents
we bought him.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.908
You are the only one
that did that.

04:19.942 --> 04:23.945
But we can make him the greatest
Christmas card of all time.

04:23.946 --> 04:26.748
We're gonna Santa hats
and big sweaters

04:26.782 --> 04:27.916
and take a picture of us all
in a lineup.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.150
<i>(Terry)
I'm sorry, Santiago,</i>

04:29.151 --> 04:30.485
but I don't have time
for that.

04:30.486 --> 04:32.187
My psych evaluation is today.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.455
They're gonna decide
if I'm ready

04:33.456 --> 04:34.556
to make it back
on the streets.

04:34.557 --> 04:35.757
Why do you care
what they think?

04:35.758 --> 04:36.992
Psychologists are just people

04:36.993 --> 04:38.793
who weren't smart enough
to be psychics.

04:38.828 --> 04:41.129
<i>(Amy) Don't worry, sergeant.
We'll add you in later.</i>

04:41.130 --> 04:42.931
[Charles sighs]

04:42.932 --> 04:45.433
Sorry, I gotta go too.
My flight is in...

04:45.434 --> 04:46.835
Ah, eight hours.

04:46.836 --> 04:48.003
I can make it.

04:48.004 --> 04:49.037
I'll buy a sandwich
on the plane.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.572
Boyle!

04:50.606 --> 04:52.574
So if Peralta, Boyle,
and the sergeant are out...

04:52.608 --> 04:54.075
Fine, everyone just go.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.744
Yeah.

04:55.778 --> 04:59.414
I could take a pic of myself
dressed up as an elf.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.082
Elfie-selfie.

05:01.117 --> 05:03.084
Not that...

05:03.085 --> 05:05.553
But I think there is something
you could help me with.

05:07.924 --> 05:09.824
You gonna sit there
all day?

05:09.825 --> 05:11.159
Affirmative, stone eagle.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.962
That's the Secret Service
codename I gave you.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.530
Just sitting here
doing my job,

05:15.531 --> 05:17.866
watching, protecting,
bossing you around.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.134
Now, for your safety,

05:19.135 --> 05:20.302
if you could open up
your Internet browser

05:20.303 --> 05:21.603
and search the words
"pigs" and "jet skis,"

05:21.604 --> 05:22.971
and that's an order.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.506
[Holt sighs]

05:24.507 --> 05:25.874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going, Cold Mountain?

05:25.875 --> 05:27.008
I changed your codename.

05:27.043 --> 05:28.510
To use the restroom.

05:28.544 --> 05:30.312
I'm only asking this
for your safety.

05:30.313 --> 05:32.747
Is it a number one
or a number two?

05:32.748 --> 05:35.183
Your silence indicates
number two.

05:35.184 --> 05:37.185
Let me do some recon.
[Grunts]

05:40.957 --> 05:42.290
It's all clear, sir.

05:42.291 --> 05:45.060
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go,

05:45.061 --> 05:49.664
go, go, go, go, go, go,

05:49.699 --> 05:51.032
Cold Mountain
is on the move.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.969
I repeat, Cold Mountain
is rolling to the can.

05:54.003 --> 05:57.339
Sergeant Jeffords,
thank you for coming in today.

05:57.340 --> 06:01.042
We are here to assess
your readiness for active duty,

06:01.043 --> 06:04.646
and if all goes
I will stamp this release form,

06:04.647 --> 06:06.147
you can go
back in the field.

06:06.182 --> 06:08.016
Well, I think I'm ready.

06:08.017 --> 06:11.186
I am no longer fixating
on my fears, ha.

06:11.220 --> 06:14.255
Good. But for today,
let's... fixate on those fears.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.926
Okay.
Um...

06:17.927 --> 06:19.361
That sounds fun.

06:19.362 --> 06:22.297
<i>Let's begin by talking
about your baby girls</i>

06:22.298 --> 06:24.566
and your wife,

06:24.600 --> 06:26.735
and what would happen to them
if you died...

06:26.736 --> 06:28.703
In the line of duty.

06:30.072 --> 06:32.040
I popped your pillow.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.419
<i>(Jake)
Captain...</i>

06:44.420 --> 06:46.454
Where do you think
you're going?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.256
I'm going home
to work in peace.

06:48.257 --> 06:50.959
That's a negative, ice veins.
Changed your codename again.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.661
Do you know why I chose you
to be my security escort?

06:53.696 --> 06:55.363
Because I'm a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes?

06:55.398 --> 06:57.665
No, I chose you
because the threat is not real.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.234
Mm-hmm.

06:59.268 --> 07:00.935
And I thought you'd have
no problem breaking the rules

07:00.936 --> 07:02.470
and letting me
get my work done.

07:02.471 --> 07:03.938
Now... let me go.

07:03.973 --> 07:05.440
Well, you thought wrong.

07:05.441 --> 07:07.208
You can't go home.
It's protocol.

07:07.243 --> 07:08.943
But if you really wanna
get outta here,

07:08.978 --> 07:10.745
you can come to my mom's.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.313
She lives nearby.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.481
Or I can lock you up
in the holding cell

07:13.482 --> 07:14.649
with an armed escort.

07:14.650 --> 07:15.884
Totally your call.

07:15.885 --> 07:18.453
Fine. We will go
to your mother's house.

07:18.454 --> 07:20.555
I guess I am curious
to see where...

07:20.556 --> 07:22.390
This all started.

07:22.425 --> 07:24.459
Shotgun.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.629
So... this is my mom's place.

07:27.630 --> 07:32.267
You can just throw your jacket
in the closet.

07:32.301 --> 07:33.501
That's a bathroom.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.804
Water closet.
My mom's British.

07:35.838 --> 07:37.572
Hmm.

07:37.573 --> 07:38.973
Why are there
no photographs of you?

07:39.008 --> 07:41.476
No holiday decorations.

07:41.477 --> 07:43.545
Nothing but...

07:43.546 --> 07:46.181
Motel art.

07:47.516 --> 07:49.250
This isn't
your mom's apartment.

07:49.285 --> 07:52.187
It's a safe house, son!
You've been protected.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.122
Don't say "son."

07:54.123 --> 07:55.723
Get outta my way.

07:55.758 --> 07:57.058
Look, you wouldn't stay
at your desk

07:57.059 --> 07:58.393
and you evaded
your protection detail.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.228
I'm sorry, but I've gotta
order you to stay.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.729
I love giving you orders.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.064
The only way you're gonna
keep me here

08:03.065 --> 08:04.466
is if you physically stop me.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.567
Can you do that, Peralta?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.634
[Indistinct mumbling]

08:06.669 --> 08:09.671
I didn't think so.

08:09.705 --> 08:11.806
Jordan.
Ahh!

08:11.807 --> 08:13.141
<i>(Jake)
Oh, no.</i>

08:13.175 --> 08:15.510
We're handcuffed together
and we've lost the key.

08:15.544 --> 08:18.012
Falconer one to HQ,
stone eagle is in the cage.

08:18.013 --> 08:20.315
I repeat,
stone eagle is in the cage.

08:24.594 --> 08:29.298
I told you the death threat
was not serious.

08:29.299 --> 08:31.567
So what on earth
are you doing?

08:31.601 --> 08:33.602
Look, I know you think
that I'm just goofing around,

08:33.635 --> 08:35.871
but I got a direct order
from your boss

08:35.871 --> 08:37.306
to protect you.

08:37.307 --> 08:38.874
So from this point forward,
we're on lockdown.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.808
Fine. But before we go
into lockdown...

08:40.844 --> 08:42.144
Too late.
You're on it.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.345
I'd like to text my husband

08:43.346 --> 08:44.580
and tell him I'll be
coming home late tonight.

08:44.581 --> 08:46.014
<i>All right,
but for security reasons,</i>

08:46.015 --> 08:47.316
I get to craft the message.

08:47.317 --> 08:49.218
Let's start
with a pleasant greeting.

08:49.219 --> 08:50.719
How about...
"Hello, honey."

08:50.720 --> 08:52.354
You will not craft
the message.

08:52.388 --> 08:54.022
Okay, Roger that.
"Honey's" wrong.

08:54.023 --> 08:55.624
How about "hello, husband"?

08:55.658 --> 08:56.925
How about "hello, sir"?

08:56.960 --> 08:59.394
You call each other "sir"?
Give me my phone.

08:59.395 --> 09:02.030
Fine.

09:02.031 --> 09:04.233
I'll give you some privacy.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.637
Maybe put Hitchcock's head
on top like an angel.

09:08.671 --> 09:09.738
Mm.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.807
<i>(Gina)
Like that?</i>

09:11.841 --> 09:13.609
No, put it behind the tree.

09:13.610 --> 09:15.110
<i>(Amy) Thanks for helping
me make this card.</i>

09:15.111 --> 09:16.411
You're so good
at this stuff.

09:16.412 --> 09:18.647
[Laughs] I know.
I'm good at everything.

09:18.648 --> 09:20.916
All right, so here's
all the pictures of Rosa

09:20.917 --> 09:22.117
that we have.

09:22.118 --> 09:23.752
<i>Which one should we use?</i>

09:23.786 --> 09:26.655
[Groans] She never smiles.
Is her mouth broken?

09:26.656 --> 09:28.657
Well, what about if we...

09:28.691 --> 09:31.362
<i>Flip those lips?</i>

09:31.394 --> 09:32.794
Oh, God.
Oof!

09:32.795 --> 09:34.296
<i>(Gina)
That's horrifying.</i>

09:34.330 --> 09:35.531
We have to get a picture
of Rosa smiling.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.666
<i>Holt's card
has to be perfect.</i>

09:37.667 --> 09:39.501
Guys... I got this.

09:39.536 --> 09:41.370
<i>I can make Rosa smile.</i>

09:41.371 --> 09:43.272
Just keep your cameras ready.

09:45.308 --> 09:46.875
Making coffee?

09:46.910 --> 09:48.213
<i>Can you make another cup</i>

09:48.244 --> 09:51.113
for senor tickle
and his nueve amigos?

09:51.147 --> 09:52.414
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

09:52.415 --> 09:55.887
What the hell, Hitchcock?
Ow, ahh! Ow, ow, ow!

09:55.919 --> 09:57.486
I think you sprained
senor tickle.

09:57.487 --> 09:59.688
Next time, I break it off.

09:59.689 --> 10:01.392
[Hitchcock whimpers]

10:01.424 --> 10:02.691
<i>Ow!</i>

10:04.093 --> 10:05.527
All right.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.196
My safe house,
my rules.

10:07.197 --> 10:10.933
This is a no tie zone.

10:10.967 --> 10:13.902
A hungry safe house
is an unsafe safe house.

10:15.505 --> 10:18.407
A fun safe house
is a safe safe house.

10:18.408 --> 10:20.142
My serve.

10:20.143 --> 10:22.377
Ah.

10:24.113 --> 10:25.380
I thought you said
you've never played this.

10:25.381 --> 10:26.380
It's very intuitive.

10:26.382 --> 10:28.150
Let's have another sandwich.

10:28.184 --> 10:29.885
A <i>safe house-</i> watching
safe house

10:29.886 --> 10:32.120
is a safe safe house house.

10:32.121 --> 10:33.455
I've already seen the film.

10:33.489 --> 10:34.756
I enjoyed it.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.158
Wow, I would not
have guessed that.

10:36.159 --> 10:37.826
You see, those are the kind
of things that you learn

10:37.827 --> 10:39.228
when you're handcuffed
together.

10:39.229 --> 10:40.796
And that is the true meaning
of Christmas.

10:40.830 --> 10:42.130
[Knocking on door]

10:42.165 --> 10:43.632
Who knows we're here?

10:43.666 --> 10:46.602
Get behind me.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.036
No, no!
Going over!

10:48.037 --> 10:50.372
Standard protocol suggests
that you put me in another room

10:50.373 --> 10:51.940
before you open the door.

10:51.941 --> 10:53.108
But since you've cuffed us
together...

10:53.109 --> 10:54.243
I order you to be quiet.
[Sighs]

10:54.277 --> 10:55.644
Come on.

10:59.682 --> 11:01.183
Freeze, sicko!
Ah!

11:01.217 --> 11:02.951
Jake, it's me,
Charles from work.

11:05.154 --> 11:08.257
Okay, let's switch gears,
do a little word association.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.992
<i>What do you think of</i>

11:10.026 --> 11:11.360
when I say the word "bottle"?

11:11.394 --> 11:15.964
Liquor store, holdup,
gun, die.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.165
How about "grass"?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.369
Marijuana, drugs.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.437
Gun, die.

11:22.472 --> 11:23.505
Cat.

11:23.506 --> 11:25.107
Kitten.

11:25.108 --> 11:26.208
Cute.

11:26.209 --> 11:28.844
<i>Calm.
False sense of security.</i>

11:28.845 --> 11:30.646
Gun, die.

11:31.648 --> 11:33.081
<i>What are you doing?</i>

11:33.116 --> 11:34.783
You gonna stamp my form?

11:34.817 --> 11:39.788
No. I just didn't want the ink
to dry out.

11:41.457 --> 11:42.691
Boyle, what are you
doing here?

11:42.692 --> 11:43.992
I thought you had
to catch a flight.

11:43.993 --> 11:45.994
I do.
My flight is in six hours.

11:45.995 --> 11:47.396
But the Captain
texted me to come,

11:47.397 --> 11:48.664
so I'm here.
What?

11:48.698 --> 11:50.065
You texted Boyle
when you told me

11:50.066 --> 11:51.366
you were texting
your husband?

11:51.401 --> 11:53.502
As the person who's completely
in charge here,

11:53.536 --> 11:55.704
I am <i>very</i> disappointed
in you.

11:55.705 --> 11:58.540
I'm changing your codename
to "bad boy."

11:58.574 --> 11:59.941
Oh, I can't imagine
what it's like

11:59.942 --> 12:01.877
to be disappointed at
someone under your command.

12:01.878 --> 12:04.546
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Tushy.

12:04.580 --> 12:06.548
It's touche.

12:06.582 --> 12:08.050
Well, I'm in charge,
and I say it's tushy.

12:08.051 --> 12:09.050
Boyle?

12:09.052 --> 12:10.352
I've heard it both ways.

12:10.353 --> 12:11.687
Please don't involve me
in this.

12:11.688 --> 12:12.888
I'm just here
to uncuff the Captain

12:12.889 --> 12:14.189
and take him
to his old precinct.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.390
What?

12:15.425 --> 12:16.992
Old precinct?
Wait a minute.

12:17.026 --> 12:18.660
You weren't going home
at all.

12:18.695 --> 12:20.395
You were going
to investigate the threat

12:20.396 --> 12:21.997
because it's not a hoax,
it's real!

12:22.031 --> 12:24.066
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!

12:24.100 --> 12:25.300
You have a tell.

12:25.335 --> 12:27.035
When you lie,
the corner of your mouth moves,

12:27.070 --> 12:28.236
and it just moved.

12:28.237 --> 12:29.838
[Slowed down]
Wrong, it's not real.

12:29.872 --> 12:30.939
You're lying!

12:30.973 --> 12:32.274
Fine.

12:32.275 --> 12:33.608
I believe the threat is real,

12:33.609 --> 12:35.210
though I'm not sure
who's behind it.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.878
But this is my problem,

12:36.913 --> 12:38.280
and I'm gonna solve it
on my own.

12:38.281 --> 12:39.681
Boyle, uncuff me.
Don't do it, Charles.

12:39.716 --> 12:41.183
I'll take you on that trip
to the botanical gardens

12:41.184 --> 12:42.884
we've always talked about.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.219
Uncuff me,
and that's a direct order.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.721
Don't do it, best friend.
Botanical gardens.

12:45.755 --> 12:48.156
Ah! This is just like Christmas
at my parents' house.

12:48.157 --> 12:49.825
Why do they have
separate dining rooms?

12:49.859 --> 12:52.728
[Scoffing]
I...

12:53.896 --> 12:55.464
Both: No!

12:55.465 --> 12:57.199
<i>(Jake) That was not
one of the options!</i>

12:57.233 --> 12:58.967
I couldn't choose,
I love you both so much.

13:00.737 --> 13:02.137
Who wants to watch <i>safe house?</i>

13:05.774 --> 13:08.743
So, including letters, e-mails,
and texts from a blocked phone,

13:08.744 --> 13:10.411
we have received
ten threats.

13:10.445 --> 13:11.913
How many people
have you put away

13:11.947 --> 13:13.180
that might want you dead?

13:13.215 --> 13:14.515
I've arrested
over 600 people.

13:14.550 --> 13:15.716
Brag.

13:15.717 --> 13:17.018
Boyle, will you please
read the transcripts

13:17.052 --> 13:18.352
<i>of the threats
he's received?</i>

13:18.353 --> 13:19.554
Yup.

13:19.555 --> 13:21.556
"Die, die, die."
"Die, Holt, die."

13:21.590 --> 13:23.257
Okay, a little obvious.

13:23.292 --> 13:24.792
"You will drown
in your own blood."

13:24.793 --> 13:26.193
<i>Better.</i>

13:26.228 --> 13:27.562
Although I would've gone
with the whole,

13:27.563 --> 13:29.030
"I'm gonna staple my face
onto your face" thing.

13:29.064 --> 13:31.532
Human skin mask.
Classic.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.135
The next one is "I'm gonna
send you off the deep end."

13:34.169 --> 13:36.170
"Drowning" and "deep end."

13:36.171 --> 13:38.372
Almost sounds like he's talking
about a swimming pool.

13:38.407 --> 13:40.074
It's Haimes.

13:40.108 --> 13:41.375
Aha!
Who's Haimes?

13:41.410 --> 13:44.145
Colin Haimes,
the freestyle killer.

13:44.146 --> 13:48.015
He took out an entire 4x100
meter relay swim team in 1982.

13:50.819 --> 13:51.819
Marco.

13:51.853 --> 13:53.087
[Cocks gun]

13:53.121 --> 13:56.924
Now you say "polo," punk.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.459
The freestyle killer.

13:58.493 --> 14:00.161
Man! How come
all the killers you've caught

14:00.162 --> 14:01.629
had such cool names?

14:01.630 --> 14:04.231
The best name I ever brought in
was "narrow shoes" Sam,

14:04.266 --> 14:05.900
because... his shoes were
narrow and his name was Sam.

14:05.901 --> 14:07.768
I get it.
Yeah, you get it.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.738
Well, Captain, it looks like
you needed our help after all.

14:10.772 --> 14:12.406
Together, we figured out
it was Haimes,

14:12.441 --> 14:14.041
and together,
we're gonna take him down.

14:14.042 --> 14:16.110
Because together,
we can do anything.

14:16.111 --> 14:17.812
Here we go!

14:17.813 --> 14:20.781
I'm finding Haimes
<i>alone.</i>

14:21.817 --> 14:24.385
Coming back at you, Jake!

14:27.222 --> 14:28.823
Oh, my God, Rosa!

14:28.857 --> 14:30.191
I accidentally
opened your mail,

14:30.192 --> 14:31.258
but look what it says.

14:31.293 --> 14:34.228
"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."

14:34.229 --> 14:35.563
Rosa, guess what.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.031
I accidentally
opened your mail,

14:37.032 --> 14:38.232
and here's what it says.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.834
<i>"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."</i>

14:39.835 --> 14:41.602
No, I'm reading the letter,
and you're taking the picture.

14:41.603 --> 14:42.603
What?

14:42.638 --> 14:44.005
Ha!

14:44.006 --> 14:45.339
You were trying to get me
to smile for your dumb picture,

14:45.340 --> 14:47.274
but you messed up.

14:47.309 --> 14:49.143
Ah! She smiled.
She's smiling!

14:49.144 --> 14:51.045
And no one has a camera.
[Sighs]

14:51.079 --> 14:52.580
[Camera clicks]
Got it, Amy.

14:52.581 --> 14:53.981
Got a picture
of you frowning.

14:53.982 --> 14:55.216
That's what you wanted,
right?

14:57.185 --> 14:58.184
[Horn honking]

14:58.186 --> 14:59.387
Peralta,
for the last time

14:59.388 --> 15:00.521
we don't have to go back
to the precinct.

15:00.522 --> 15:01.689
I don't need
everyone's help.

15:01.723 --> 15:03.557
Look, Captain,
you're stubborn.

15:03.558 --> 15:04.992
And that's
an adorable quality.

15:05.027 --> 15:07.161
You wanna know what's not
an adorable quality?

15:07.195 --> 15:08.295
Being dead.
Acne.

15:08.296 --> 15:09.497
Yep, being dead.

15:09.498 --> 15:10.564
I mean, I give up.

15:10.599 --> 15:11.732
What's going on with you?

15:11.733 --> 15:12.967
Why are you being
so weird about this?

15:12.968 --> 15:14.235
I don't need your help.

15:14.236 --> 15:17.438
I don't wanna involve you,
or Boyle, or anyone.

15:17.439 --> 15:19.040
Because I brought
this situation on myself.

15:19.074 --> 15:22.009
No one should get hurt
because of a dumb mistake I made

15:22.010 --> 15:23.744
as a brash, young Detective.

15:23.779 --> 15:25.146
Hey, Haimes.

15:25.180 --> 15:26.514
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life

15:26.515 --> 15:29.250
in a little cement room,
doing nothing.

15:29.284 --> 15:32.186
And while you're in there,
I'm gonna go for a swim.

15:32.220 --> 15:36.157
And after that swim,
I might take another swim.

15:36.191 --> 15:37.825
And you'll just be
sitting there

15:37.859 --> 15:40.928
on your metal toilet,

15:40.929 --> 15:44.865
thinking of me
swim, swim, swimming

15:44.866 --> 15:47.234
all day long.

15:47.269 --> 15:48.602
When I get out of lockup,

15:48.603 --> 15:50.871
I'm gonna hunt you down
and kill you.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.807
Yeah.
[Laughs]

15:52.808 --> 15:54.075
Right.

15:54.076 --> 15:55.576
Wow.

15:55.577 --> 15:56.944
I think I really would've gotten
along with young Ray Holt.

15:56.945 --> 15:58.012
Yes, that's why I decided

15:58.046 --> 15:59.714
to change everything
about my life.

15:59.748 --> 16:01.415
Well, frankly, sir,
you're still acting

16:01.416 --> 16:02.883
like that brash,
dumb Detective.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.119
If you had truly changed,
you'd be saying

16:05.153 --> 16:07.088
a bunch of boring,
responsible stuff, like...

16:07.089 --> 16:08.456
"Don't be stupid.

16:08.457 --> 16:10.357
"Use the Detective squad.
You're part of a team.

16:10.358 --> 16:11.625
I smell like sandalwood."

16:11.660 --> 16:13.127
That's what it is!

16:13.128 --> 16:15.362
Yet another terrible impression,
Peralta.

16:15.397 --> 16:16.764
But I think you're right.

16:16.798 --> 16:18.499
Wait, what?

16:20.268 --> 16:21.635
Sir, I'm sure
you had your reasons

16:21.636 --> 16:23.304
for going to Peralta,
but...

16:23.305 --> 16:26.040
This is exactly the type of job
I would love to have.

16:26.074 --> 16:28.309
Okay, the next time someone
threatens to kill me,

16:28.310 --> 16:29.610
I'll come straight to you.

16:29.644 --> 16:31.278
Thank you, sir.

16:31.279 --> 16:33.347
I can't wait.

16:33.348 --> 16:36.650
I... didn't mean...

16:36.685 --> 16:38.919
Let's catch this bastard.

Nothing yet.

16:44.359 --> 16:46.260

16:46.294 --> 16:47.795
Uh, some intel coming in
from ossining.

16:47.796 --> 16:49.396
Haimes was released
two weeks ago.

16:49.431 --> 16:52.566
Good. Hitchcock and Scully,
update on your secret project?

16:52.601 --> 16:54.068
Hazelnut coffee'll be up
in five minutes.

16:54.069 --> 16:55.569

16:55.604 --> 16:56.737
Keep me updated.

16:56.772 --> 16:57.905
Warrant for the phone trace
came through.

16:57.906 --> 16:59.206
We got Haimes' number...

16:59.207 --> 17:01.175
And the last coordinates
from its GPS.

17:01.209 --> 17:02.810
The rail yards.

17:02.811 --> 17:05.980
All right, we got him.
Everyone suit up!

17:05.981 --> 17:07.848
I know there's no point
in telling you not to come,

17:07.883 --> 17:09.349
but while we're out there,
you're sticking with me.

17:09.384 --> 17:10.651
Oh. Goodie.

17:10.685 --> 17:12.685
Man, you really know
how to take the fun

17:12.686 --> 17:13.854
out of saving your life.

17:13.888 --> 17:15.589
You heard him, Hitchcock.

17:15.589 --> 17:17.191
Get that Sumatran
in the thermos.

I just want you to know

17:27.868 --> 17:30.204
it's been an honor
being able to boss you around.

17:30.205 --> 17:31.806
Anything else?

17:31.807 --> 17:35.075
Yes. What cute little nickname
do you call your husband?

17:35.076 --> 17:36.811
Kevin.

17:36.845 --> 17:38.546
Adorable.

17:40.215 --> 17:41.582
(Rosa) Sorry you
missed your flight.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.119
I have a backup flight
in four hours.

17:48.156 --> 17:50.152
Gotta flush him out.

17:50.158 --> 17:51.659
We got his number now.
Call his phone.

on that ringtone.

He's heading north
on track 17!

18:19.254 --> 18:20.921
Hey.

18:20.922 --> 18:24.091

Thought about you
every day I was in jail

18:37.505 --> 18:39.039
just like you said.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.708
I thought about
pointing a gun at you

18:40.742 --> 18:42.910
and pulling the trigger.

18:42.944 --> 18:45.379
Kinda like this.

the kind of thing
