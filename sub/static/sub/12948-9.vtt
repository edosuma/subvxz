WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
BOY:
Hold on, I just got

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
out of the shower.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
There's some juice
on the table.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Mm-hm.
Take your time.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
You wanna explain to me
what you're doing here?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I came looking
for booty.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
You came looking for sex
with an underage boy?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Oh, no. I ain't come looking
for no little boys.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I ain't got no milk,
no cookies, nothing.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I came looking
for man's butt.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
A man's butt?
Excuse me?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh, I know who you are,
Chris Hansen.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
But see I calls you
Chris Handsome.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Oh, no,
look at this.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I watch your TV show
all the time.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
So you can go ahead
and bring in them cameras

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
and them police
is waiting outside.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
It don't make me
no difference.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Now, I'll tell you what.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I like you,
and I want you.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Nigga, what you want?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I want you over my house
cutting my grass

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Now, we can do this
the easy way,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
like you supposed to be!
Well, too bad for you,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
or we can do it
the hard way.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
The choice is yours.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
because I just took
another job.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, I don't think
you and I

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
And even though
they don't pay hardly nothing,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
will be doing anything
any kind of way.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
working for white folks
look way better on my résumé.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay, I see
you choosing the hard way.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Damn it, this is
the fourth week in a row

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay, cut.
This isn't working.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
you canceled on me.
The yard looks like a jungle.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Someone get this guy out--

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Well, Chim-Chim,
you three vine swingers

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Don't make me ruin
that butt, Chris!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
should feel right at home.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
No. Please!
I'm a warrior!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I'll be there
when the white man

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
don't need me no more.
And let this be

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
yet another reminder
that no matter

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
how much money you got,
you still just a nigga.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Ooh, I hate Ruckus!

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Huey, go change your clothes
and mow the lawn.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Why do I always
have to cut the grass?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I cannot stop sneezing.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Riley's got allergies.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You just mad 'cause
you didn't think of it first.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Ow!

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
That didn't hurt,
punk.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Huey. Hurry up.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
And I don't want
to hear that old

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
"I'm dying
of a heat stroke" excuse.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
You wanna cool down?
Cut your hair off.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
HUEY: Tom DuBois was widely known

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Good day and how are you this
beautiful morning, good sir?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
to be a friend of the gay community.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm visiting you
to make you aware

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Tom was a crusader for gay marriage.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
of an exciting offer
I got in landscaping

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
He marched in gay pride parades.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
and home repair work
that has just--

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
He watched gay movies and never once turned away

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm talking about just touched
down in your area.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Not interested.
W-w-wait.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
or even made a face during the gay sex scenes.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
What exciting offer?
Let me ask you this:

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
TOM:
Wow.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Sean Penn is amazing.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Are you really satisfied
with your current landscaping

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
HUEY: But beneath Tom's support

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
of the gay community

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and home repair
service provider?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
was a dark secret.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No.
Yes, go away.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
That would be
a Mr. Uncle Ruckus, right?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Tom had a fear of going to jail

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
A portly dude, not very fond
of African-Americans?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
and being anally raped.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, hey, hey nigga.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You got a nice
little ass, nigga.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What if I could offer you
a better service

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
with way lower prices

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Gimme your ass, nigga.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You see me looking at you.
Gimme your ass.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
with none of the racial
antagonism?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
No! Stay away!
MAN: Hey, brown skin!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
How's that sounding to you?
How much?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I'll have your shit looking
splendiferous for a wet dub.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
No.
Okay, I'll drop the price to 10.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
HUEY: The phobia got so bad

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
At this point
I ain't even making no money,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
he took a leave of absence from his job.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm just doing this
for my back arms.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I said no.
A cigarette and a cold glass

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Eventually, he stopped leaving the house altogether.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
of orange juice.
Go hustle somebody else.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Check this out, Pops. Because
I want your good favor so bad,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Finally, Tom found a program specializing in his phobia,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I went ahead and put in
a little work on the yard.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
treating patients with a combination

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
You what?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
of group therapy...  ■
My name is Tom.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
MAN:
That's right.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Your boy cut the grass,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And I have a fear
of going to jail

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
manicured the little weed area,
and even did

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and being anally raped.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
a little shrubbery art.
You planted flowers.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
ALL:
Hi, Tom.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
confidence-building affirmations...

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
You needed a little color
right there, man.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It wasn't any thang.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
ALL:
My booty is mine.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It belongs to me.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You cannot take my booty.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, I'm impressed,
young man.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
...and basic self-defense.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Very impressed.
Don't meet a lot of people

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So when grabbed
from behind,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
who take pride
in their work nowadays.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
The first thing we do
is drop our center of gravity.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Sorry
I was so rude earlier.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You earned this.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Then, we thrust
our hips backwards

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Yo, man, I-- I was cool
with the orange juice.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and our arms forward,
breaking the hold.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No, no, no. You take it.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I really appreciate this,
Pops. Seriously.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Okay, Tom.
Now, I'll do you

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Matter of fact, man, let's go
look at some hos, on me.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and you try to get me off.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Huh?
Yeah. House of Cheeks

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I can't!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
with the bungalow
booty bitches.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
It was a long road to recovery.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You know, they probably
just now cracking the doors.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
PRINCIPAL:
This is the third time

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
your boys have been caught

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Beers is cold
and the bitches ain't sweaty.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
fighting this quarter,
Mr. Freeman.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Come on, let's go and,
you know, see some ass.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
This time, it was a brawl
against five other boys.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
What happened to him?
He got in the way.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
You have two options,
Mr. Freeman.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The first is that both
of your boys

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
are expelled from school.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Ooh,
I'll take that one.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Man, this is fun.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Pick that one,
Granddad!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And, uh,
what's the other?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
It's been awhile
since I had someone to go

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
to a strip club with.
So thanks.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
We send your boys to prison.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Hold up. Don't you think
that's a little--

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I didn't even
get your name.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
This is a permission slip
for our Scared Stiff program.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Just call me Lando.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Lando, you mean like
Lando Calrissian?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Delinquent students
visit a real jail

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, Lando's really
my daddy's name.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
so they can interact
with real inmates

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
and see the real future
that awaits them

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Or that's what Moms
told a nigga,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
if they continue with their
pathological behavior.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
since I never knew him.
She met him right when

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Ooh, I change my mind,
Granddad!

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
The Empire Strikes Back  ■
came out.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
You know,
people used to call me Lando.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Pick jail! Pick jail!
Pick jail! Pick jail!

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I remember that summer:
1980, Chicago.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Please let me go to jail!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Tom, do you have something

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Best summer of my life.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I knew it was gonna be
my year.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
you'd like to share
with the group?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And boy I milked it for all it was worth.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Why, yes I do.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
My name is Tom.
And I am no longer afraid

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Now, of course I wasn't as smooth as Billy Dee,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
of going to prison
and being anally raped.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
or good-looking as Billy Dee,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and I definitely didn't have no Billy Dee money,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's fantastic, Tom.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And to prove it,
tomorrow I'm going to prison.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
but thank God some women were so desperate

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
they just didn't care.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
MAN: Did he say--?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I've agreed to chaperone
a Scared Stiff program.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I remember this one gal.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm taking a group
of troubled youths to prison

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Her name was
Marietta.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
so they can mend
their ways.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh, she was hot.
It was like I was doing it

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, that's excellent, Tom.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
with the same caliber of women
as Billy Dee himself.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
MAN:
Whoa, man,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
are you sure about that?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Moms was a big
Billy Dee fan.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Absolutely.
I'm looking forward to it.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
In the day we would go see Empire Strikes Back,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
See? Tom is going to face
his fears head on.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
and at night we'd have
some serious,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And he's gonna walk out
of that prison with his rectum

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
no-holds barred freaky deaky
bareback action.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Whoo!
For real?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and his peace of mind
intact.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
You have to understand,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
this was in the days before
AIDS.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Way to go, Tom!
MAN: Way to go, buddy.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
So there was no consequences
whatsoever.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Anybody wanna come
with me?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
That's so funny.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
ALL: No.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Moms used to say
the same thing.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
No? Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
It was just like:
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
SARAH:
Honey, it is great

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
that you're making

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
so much progress
with the therapy,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I always wondered
what happened to her.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
but I just don't want you

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I guess I'll never know.
Gone for good.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
to think you have to prove
anything to anyone.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I will never,
ever in a million years

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, honey--
Look, I'm not worried

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
know what happened to her.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
about your safety,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh, well.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
but I'd hate for you to have
a bad experience

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
You know, my mom's name
was Marietta.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
and go back to
how you were.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You know,
I was thinking about

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Really. What a random,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
becoming
a defense attorney.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
completely
unrelated coincidence

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
But how can I do that

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
that has nothing
to do with me.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
if I'm too scared
to step foot in prison?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Pops. I don't even know
how to say this, man,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
How would I meet
with the clients?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Wow! Tom.
I had no idea.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
but I didn't come here
just to do your yard.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Imagine it, sweetie.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Huh?
I came to Woodcrest

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Saving people
from anal rape

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
because I think
you're my dad.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
instead of sending them
to it.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes, she does.
Really nice ones. Oh, yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And that's what this trip
is about.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
These boys need
this trip.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Mm-hm.
No, no, I said

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I think you're my dad.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
They don't fear
jail at all,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
which means they'll probably
end up there

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Don't worry about the tab.
I got the next round.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
No, no, I said...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
if no one does anything.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Don't you see, honey?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
If I'm afraid
to live my life

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Wait, wait, hold on.
Wait, hold on.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
then the anal rapists win.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I knew it. I knew you
were a scam artist the moment

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
My anus
is gonna be fine.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I laid eyes on you.
Pops, please, man.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And I'm gonna make sure
those young boys' anuses

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Please, man,
just give me a second.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
are just fine too.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Shame on you trying to scam
an old man.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Mowing his lawn, trimming his
shrubs, planting some color.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Pause.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't ever want
to see you around here again.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
TOM:
Okay, guys,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
remember to stay

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh, come on, man.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
with the group at all times.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And remember,
nothing metal in your pockets.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Pops, man, wait.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Wait, Pop, Pop.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The guards will take it away
from you

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
You my ride!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
and you won't
get it back, okay?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Ah, okay, this is it.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Granddad, it's not like
you did anything wrong.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
All right, alrighty.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
My name is Uncle Ruckus,
Volunteer Corrections Officer.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
He's not my son.
I mean, you had no way to know.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Did you hear what I just said?
He's not my son.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Next stop, Willie Horton
Maximum Security Prison.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
And I don't ever
want to hear

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
the name Lando
in this house again.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Now, you white
children be prepared.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And no one is allowed
to watch  Empire Strikes Back

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
This is gonna be
like a trip to the zoo.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
or  The Return of the Jedi
ever again either.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
But do not worry,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
your Uncle Ruckus
will protect you.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And as for you Negroes,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
well, this just gonna be
like a trip to the future.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Hey, Pops.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
So it should be exciting
for everybody!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You. I told you
to get away from here.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Come on aboard!

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
We got mm-hm, all right...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I tried to be nice.
Now I'm calling the police.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You're trespassing
on private property.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Wait, where's Riley?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Hey, Pops, I'm not
stalking you or nothing,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Riley, what are you doing?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm just over here doing
some work for the DuBois'.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Nothing.
Give it here.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Big Tom, big Tom.
What's the business, baby?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Come on.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Keep sending them dumbass
niggas to jail, big dude.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Riley, I am very
disappointed in you.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
They ham-ass know they shouldn't
have did that shit.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Anyway, the hot water fixed
in the guest bathroom,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Now go get on that bus.
We going inside, Mr. DuBois.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
so you all good.
The guests can drop a deuce,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Anything
can happen in there.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
wash they booger hooks,
get fresh, disinfect.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I gots to have
my shank.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
You want me make you one?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
No prob. Know what I'm talking
about? Popping your collar.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I brought
an extra toothbrush.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now.
Man, if something happens,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, man,
you are a godsend.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
it's your fault.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Robert, I guess we have you
to thank for Lando, huh?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
What's that supposed to mean?
I didn't give him life,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
RILEY: Anything can happen

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
in there.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
If something happens, it's your fault.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
if that's what you're implying.
I told him you were

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Anything can happen in there. We going inside, Mr. DuBois.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
the first one to give
a brother a chance

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
to show what I can do.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
And don't worry, Lando,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I'm gonna make some calls
as well.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Hey, you know I gotta put
my folks on.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
You know how we do.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Where's this guy been
all our lives, huh?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
See you later.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
What is your game?
Blackmail? Extortion?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
What do you want
from me?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
My mother left a journal.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
She said she got pregnant
by a man she loved very much,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
whose nickname was Lando.
And there was this.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
MAN:
Put my finger

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
in your ass, man.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's tougher
to shock kids nowadays.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Man, I ain't come here
to steal nothing from you, man.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
They already know
what goes on in jail.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
But we do our best to scare
the living shit out of them.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I just wanted to find my pops
and tell him

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
that I thank him for skeeting
that life into Moms, man.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
CONVICT:
Some of you are here today

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
'cause you think jail is cool.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I just wanted to tell him
I love him very much,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But see y'all wouldn't
know nothing about that shit.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
and I respect him
for everything he did, man.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Ain't shit cool
about jail, nyukka!

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Get away from me.
You can't be my son.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
You too ugly to be my son.
Oh, okay. I-I get it.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
MAN:
Ain't nothing cool.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I been here 10 years,
and I ain't never getting out.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
The problem
ain't having a son,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I ain't do much.
Just kill somebody.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
i-it's just having
me as a son, huh?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It ain't like the nyukka
ain't have it coming.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I want you out of this
neighborhood

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
and out of my life forever.
You got that?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
MAN: He sure did.
Y'all think

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
it's just about us in here,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Everybody do things
on they own time.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but this is about
an oppressive,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I ain't in no rush.
I ain't even tripping.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
fucked-up system
designed to keep niggas

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Only thing is, I don't know
what your Casio looking like.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
down and shit.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Y'all wouldn't know
nothing about that.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But you know, whenever
you wanna holler at your boy,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
What about you, little nigga?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm right here, man,
posted like a lamp.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You know about that?
Yes.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I love you, Pops. I ain't never
gonna stop loving you.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Oh, you know about that?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Tell me
what you know about that!

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Never.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Tell me what you think
about that!

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
The prison-industrial complex
is a system situated

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
GRANDDAD:
I'm sorry to stop by

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
on such short notice.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
at the intersection
of government

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I didn't really know
who else to turn to.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
and private interests.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
It uses prisons as a solution
to social, political,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Come on, Pops.
You know it ain't no thang,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm here to help. So you need
a person, uh, removed?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
and economic problems.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It includes
human rights violations,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yes.
You mean, like,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
the death penalty,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
removed from the Earth?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
slave labor,
policing, courts,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
No. I mean like removed
from the neighborhood.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
the media,
political prisoners,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh-ho-ho, so you want him
kidnapped.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
and the elimination of dissent.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, kinda.
Not really.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Nigga, did you just say

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Can't you just take him
someplace really far away

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
what I was trying to say
but smarter?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
like South America
or Africa or something?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, you realize
that if you don't kill him

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I like this little nigga.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
But you left one thing out,
little nigga.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
there's nothing preventing him
from coming back.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Show of hands, how many people
ever raped a man.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, if you took him
really far away,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
he wouldn't have
enough money to come back.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
RILEY:
Pause. Heh-heh.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I don't know.
I just want him to go away.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Uh-huh. How many people
ever been raped by a man?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
back up.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
RILEY:
Pause again.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Who we talking about?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
All of them.
One hundred percent.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
His name is Lando.
Oh, shit, Lando?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You can't get no higher
than that, nyukka.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You step in here,
you getting raped.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
The new handyman?

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Right up the motherfucking
brown eye, baby.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Man, that motherfucker
is cold with that landscaping.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I raped a few niggas myself.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
What's your beef with him?
He's a con man

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I ain't really enjoy it,
not that much.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
pretending to be my son.
Oh, I see.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Shit, it felt good
to the motherfucker though.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But he ain't your son?
He is absolutely, positively,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I ain't let that nigga
kiss me or nothing,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
almost virtually
certainly not.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
but I did tear that
motherfucking ass up, nigga,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Shit,
he seemed cool to me.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I ain't gonna lie about it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
But that's what the Man's

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You know how some people
you just like right off the bat?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
oppressive system did to me.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
But yeah, shit,
I say kill him.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Now, me?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm more
of a romantic type.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Kill him?
I don't wanna kill him.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll still rape you,
but I'll definitely stroke

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
All right, all right,
the only other choice might be

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
your head lovingly
while I do it.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
to get one of them DNA tests

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
See, cause I want you
to like it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
to prove
you ain't the father.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Now, you don't have
to like it.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Really? Where do you get
one of those tests done?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
But I--

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Oh, I know one place
that do it for free.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Sorry. I was distracted

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
by that fine motherfucker
right there.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
MAN: Coming up next,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
What's your name,
fine motherfucker?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
on  The Steve Wilkos Show.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I, uh...
MAN: What's your name?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I just wanna know
who my real father is.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Don't think that's, um--
Tom.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Moms always said
his nickname was Lando.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay, now let's talk
about Tom.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Didn't you used to call
yourself Lando?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Tom is the type of nigga

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Didn't you? Answer me!
Stand up!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
that gives us
wet dreams up in here.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Don't even think
about sitting on my stage.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Medium brown.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Soft features.
Tall and in shape,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Stand up!
But my knees hurt.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
but still soft and squishy.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Get your ass up.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
What kind of man
doesn't bother to see his kid

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Now, I like to put
the jelly inside my ass.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Then put some of this peanut
butter on top of it.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
for 30 years?
Thirty fucking years?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
B-But I didn't know--
You know what I wanna do?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I call it a peanut butter-jelly
and asshole sandwich.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I wanna beat
the living shit out of you!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But Tom here
will be calling it lunch.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
MAN:
Yeah, nigga!

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Whoa, easy there,
big fella.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
You know what the system
does when you come to prison?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I will not be easy on you!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I fucking hate you!

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
They strip you.
They strip you mentally,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You make me wanna--

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
emotionally,
and they strip you naked.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
But-ass naked! What the fuck
is you looking at nigga?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Before the show
you took a DNA test.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Punch you right in your
motherfucking temple, nigga.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Give me your clothes.
MAN: Beat his ass.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And the results
of the DNA test are...

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You're supposed
to be scaring the kids.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I said give me your clothes.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Robert is--

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Start with your shoes. Hurry up.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You need some help?
I got it.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Now you see this, kids?
You really,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
: Steve. Steve.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Steve. Steve.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
really, don't want this
to happen to you, okay?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Robert,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
you are the father.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
CONVICT:
And your shirt too,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
nigga! Hurry up!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You are the sack
from which I come.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
MAN:
Take it off!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
CONVICT:
Okay. Y'all

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
motherfuckers looking, huh?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
You are the sack from--

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
That's the-- That's the pair
that I came from.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Tom just got his motherfucking
manhood tested.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Look at them number one's
that I came from.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And he failed.
He should have knocked

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I came out
that tube right there.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
my motherfucking
head off.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Good-looking man.
Yes.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
And you know
what that means, don't you?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Tom, you getting raped.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
How you feel now?
Deadbeat. Huh?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Wait, I didn't know.
I-- I--

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
When you go to prison,
the most important thing

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
You finally gonna take
responsibility

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
in your life
is gonna be booty.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
or are you gonna keep making
excuses, you pussy punk bitch?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
MAN:
Better listen to him.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
A man's butt.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Booty, getting some booty

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Hey, nigga, don't call my daddy
no pussy punk bitch.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
is more important
than eating food.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Look at him.
He is a pussy punk bitch.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's more important
than drinking water.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If I see a man I like,
I tell him like this here:

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I likes you, and I want you.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Now, we can do this
the easy way,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
RILEY:
I hate to say this, Granddad,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
or we can do it
the hard way.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
but you did look like
a pussy punk bitch.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
The choice is yours.
MAN: What you want?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
You should have stuck
with your story.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
What's it gonna be?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It was a DNA test.
Well, study next time.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
MAN 1: Say it, nigga.
I asked you a question, Tom.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Ow!
Granddad,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
MAN 2: I can't hear you.
MAN 3: Say it, Tom!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
there's no use beating
yourself up.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I-I don't want to answer.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, Steve Wilkos
already did that.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Uh, excuse me
I didn't hear you, Tom.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I can't believe
all this time, a son.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I said I-I don't want to answer.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
A son named Lando.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I don't wanna...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Granddad,
it's not all your fault.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't wanna do this
anymore.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
This doesn't make you
a horrible person.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Sound like to me
you want it the hard way.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It's all your fucking fault!

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
MAN:
Give it to him!

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You're a horrible fucking person!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
GUARD:
Out of the way!

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, why me?
Why did he do this to me?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
All right,
everybody calm down!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Calm down! Now we taking
over the prison.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Granddad, it seems like
he just wants the chance

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So back up! Back up!

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
to get to know his dad.
Which means you have to be a man

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Back up! Back up!

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You can't have my booty!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
and own up to this.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
You may not
owe him anything else,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
but you do owe him that.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Man,
I say be a real nigga

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
GUARD:
Get him! Get him!

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
and don't own up
to nothing.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
You got it right
the first time.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Pretend it
never happened.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Who cares about the show?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Anybody asks,
it ain't yours.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Congratulations, Daddy.
Oh, you must be so proud.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
A 198-pound bouncing baby
adult Negro.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Boy, they grow up so fast--

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
REPORTER:
And more reports coming

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
in that hostages

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You know, Robert,
any boy can make a baby,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
are being held
inside the prison.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
but it takes a real man--

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Shut the fuck up.
I'm sick of this shit.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Hey, hey, don't blame me,
I said kill him.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
You also told me to go on
that stupid show.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
WOMAN: Hello, 911 emergency.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, my God. Listen,
you have to help!

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Hey, you ain't tell me
you was actually

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
the man's daddy.
That's bad intel.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Help me, please! Sir, please calm down.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I can't be held responsible
for no bad intel.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
What's your emergency?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I didn't know
I was his daddy.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm inside William Horton
Maximum Security Prison

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Now everybody knows.
What am I supposed to do?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Way I see it, you got
two options. Option one,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
and they attacked
the guards.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I think there's
a riot happening.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
which I don't recommend,
is to work it out.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
They've got hostages too.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Children. Oh, my God,
I left the children.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You don't recommend
working it out?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
No, but it's a option.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Sir, where did you say you were again?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
You guys are both grown,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm inside the prison.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
you try to come to terms
with it. Get to know each other,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
How long before the cops
come in and save us?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
make up for some lost time.
Now, I ain't saying

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, I wouldn't hold your breath.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
it's gonna be a easy
adjustment,

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, I got a guy on the phone that says

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
he's at Horton Prison.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
but, I mean, there's counseling,
therapy.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I-I don't know, I'll ask.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
This person could enrich
your life

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Uh, sir, have they raped you yet?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
in ways you can't
even imagine.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Ha-ha-ha!  ■
Have they raped--

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
No! What kind of a fucked
up question is that?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah, Huey said something
like that.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But I never listen to him.
Now, I still say

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
the smarter move
is option two,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
which is just let me put two
in the back his head

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
and be done with it.
Huh? No.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Hello?
AUTOMATED VOICE:  Hello.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't worry about the fee.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
You have a collect call from a correctional facility from:

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I ain't gonna rape you
on the price.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You ain't got to worry
about that.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
No. I don't want you
to kill him.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Maybe I should
just work it out.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
AUTOMATED VOICE: Do you accept the call?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Look, I can name at least
two or three instances

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes! Yes!
TOM:  Honey!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
in my life where I tried
to work out some shit

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, Tom! What's wrong?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I was in the prison, and...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
by trying to find
some mutual understanding,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and I can tell you
it's always faster

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Riley had a shank and I--
I didn't throw it away

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
and easier to just kill 'em.
It just is.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and then it started a riot.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I don't want you
to kill him. Damn.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Damn it, who let
that booty get away?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Don't know why
you keep bringing it up.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Don't look at me, I was fighting
with the guards.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
All right, up to you,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
but I think you should keep
that option open.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, what do we do now?
Ask him, it was his idea.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Matter of fact,
Lando's outside

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I thought you had some
escape plan worked out.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
doing some work on the shrubs,
I'll call him in right now.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Wasn't no escape plan.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Just let me know what
you want to do. All right?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Uh, booty is more
important than escaping.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Lando!
What?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So I said to myself
when I seen that shank,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Lando's here?
No, wait.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
"This an opportunity for me
to get some booty."

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Pops, what's going on?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That was it? Nigga,
I thought you had demands.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
He wanted to talk
to you, Lando.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Oh, I had demands.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
He wants to try to,
uh, work this out.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I had demands
to get some booty.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I thought this was supposed
to be some Attica type shit.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Look, man, I'm sorry
about what happened

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, how y'all think
that make me feel?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
on that show.
I mean, I didn't know

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
that nigga Steve Wilkos
was a dick like that.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Y'all let the booty get away.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Now I got to go
hunt down the booty. Damn.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I swear I don't need
nothing from you, man,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
except a chance
to be, maybe,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
a small part of your life,
man. Just a small one.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Tom!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Thank you, Rummy, man.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I appreciate you
giving of yourself

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
RUCKUS:
Please. Do what you want

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
to them two little
gorilla chimps over there.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
to help sort
this thing out.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Ain't no sweat, partner.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
But leave these beautiful
little white children alone.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You know
I'm in your corner.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So, what's it going
to be, Robert?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Uh, option one
or option two?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Are you gonna rape us?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Do we look like priests?
We ain't gonna hurt no kids.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Option one. Option one.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Option one it is.
No, no, no, no, no.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Now, that's good. That's good.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I said option one.
Okay.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But it is okay
if you do hurt them.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Well, which one
was option one?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Hey, nigga. Hey,
didn't I just say

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
What's option one?
Getting to know each other.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
we ain't gonna hurt no kids?
So shut the fuck up

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah?
You sure that was option one?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
and let me think!

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Yes. Let's spend
some time together,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
No plan, huh?
We didn't exactly

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
as a family.
Yeah, boy!

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
put a whole lot of thought
into this,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
That's what
I'm talking about!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
you know what I'm saying?
Guess we just kind of,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That's what I've always--
Man, look, man, I swear, man,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
you know, got caught up
in the motherfucking moment.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
once you get to know a nigga
you'll find

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I ain't even
that fucked up.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
You have grievances, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Like a motherfucker.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Is you sure, Robert?
Yes, I'm sure!

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, you got hostages.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm sure too.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Might as well
make the best of it.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Make a list
of reasonable demands

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay, then I've done my part.
It's up to y'all, now.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in exchange for the hostages
and this might all work out.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Best of luck to you.
I love you, Dad.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Hey, yo, what y'all think,
niggas?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Should we try to like, uh,
you know what I'm saying

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Boys, Lando is going to be
staying with us for awhile,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
and shit, like, uh, negotiate

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
because, supposedly,
it's the right thing to do.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
with these motherfuckers
for stuff?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
There's definitely some things
I'd like to see changed.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
I just hope you boys
take this as a lesson

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
that life can really
suck sometimes,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Me too.
Well, if we gonna do this shit,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
and you should always
wear a condom.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
we need to do it right.
We can't just be acting like

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I got a condom on
right now.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
a bunch of wild ignorant niggas

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
out there just be shouting out
demands and shit.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
This is it. You'll be sharing
this room with the boys.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
We got a motherfucking
black president now.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
No favorites.
Ha-ha.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah. What up, roomies?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Ha! Good luck! Baboon Bama'll
be in here soon too.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, this my half
of the room.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Hey, hey! You ain't too fat

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And that, that's Huey's half
of the room.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and ugly to get raped,
motherfucker.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Well, where my half at?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I apologize for my outburst.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Your half is right there.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I left the kids.
I gotta go back for the kids.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And just 'cause
you technically our uncle,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Honey, just stay there.
Let the professionals handle it.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
you ain't ahead of me,
nigga.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
As of right now,
you the youngest brother.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No. This is all my f-fault.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Got that? I'm number two,
you number three, got it?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I have to make it right.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I love you, sweetie.  ■
Tom!

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Two nigga.
Three nigga.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
No,
please don't be brave.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Say, man. I promise, man,
I'm gonna respect your space

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Bravery isn't your thing.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I love you, sweetie.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and I really, really,
appreciate, you know,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
If I don't come back,
tell Jazmine that I-I...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
just being here
part of the fam, man.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I've been a part
of this family my whole life.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
It's an overrated
experience.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
CONVICT:
Okay, so all the motions

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
brought before this
motherfucking committee

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
to add, uh, a demand
to the official list of demands

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
will be ratified
with a motherfucking

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
majority vote, nigga.
Unless that demand is vetoed

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
from the committee chief
executive,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
at which point it will require

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
a two-third majority vote
to pass.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yo, who gets to be
the chief executive?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Ah!

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm the motherfucking
chief executive, motherfucker.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Man, nigga had the trillest
dream last night.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I didn't vote for you.
I thought this was

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
On the real,
it was like your boy

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
a democracy,
you autocratic motherfucker.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
had a job at this little
bunny ranch vineyard

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Come over here,
and say that shit

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
or some shit, man,
so all I could do

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and I'll turn your motherfucking
teeth upside down.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
was lick the ladies' feet
after they was finished

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The chief executive
is a rotating office to be held

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
stepping on the grapes and
the bitches was just loving--

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Look, I can't concentrate
with your thing

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
by each member of
the Executive Riot Committee

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
flapping around like that.
Go put some clothes on.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
in order of prison ID number,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm not hungry no more.
Yeah, I'm done.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
for a period not to exceed
90 minutes' time.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Aw, come on, man,
why you all tripping?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, wait a goddamn minute.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Who the fuck is this
Executive Riot Committee?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Morning wood ain't nothing
to be ashamed of.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
That's how you know
you alive, man.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Us.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I fit to show you,
you all bitch.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh yeah, right.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay, good.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Let's go.
Junior varsity, nigga.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
First motion to introduce
a demand for rafification:

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
Nigga. Young Barkley.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
all in favor of bitches?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
LANDO: Shit.
RILEY: Punk.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Hey. That's a foul.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Brother Huey, let the record

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
show that the motion has passed.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Man, that ain't no foul,
nigga.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Please add "bitches"
to the official list of demands.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
That's playoff
basketball.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah, basketball,
not football, bitch.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
ALL:
Yeah! Bitches!

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Give me the ball.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay, next motion?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
White bitches.
Wait.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Man, just 'cause you
the two nigga

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Isn't that covered
in bitches?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Hold up! Bitches
and white bitches

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
don't mean you can treat me
any kinda way, nigga.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
is two different things.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Huey, you gonna let him
do me like this?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Well, then we have
to go back and amend

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
the previous demand
to specify white bitches.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It's family,
I'm staying out of it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Why we gotta have
a white bitch

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
because you got a white bitch?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
To me it's a wasted demand.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
They never gonna give us
a white bitch.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
They never give us one
if we don't ask.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Huey, help your baby brother,
man. The nigga melting me.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
We got to stand up,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and not just demand bitches,
but white bitches.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Well, fuck it then,
I want me an Alaskan bitch.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Beggars can't be choosers,
motherfucker.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
You guys seem a little
cramped in there.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
We already asking
for bitches, all right?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm thinking
about giving Lando his own room.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
We have white hostages.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
That's not fair.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
We have the strategic
leverage to get white bitches.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Why does the three nigga
get his own room?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
You playing favorites,
Granddad.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Man, y'all being
too picky, man.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
That's not true.
Oh, yeah?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
A bitch is a bitch.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Lando gets to drink beer.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Man, look, look,
why can't y'all

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Lando gets to smoke
with cigarettes.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
just shut the fuck up
and be happy

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
with whatever bitch
we get up in here?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Why you love Lando
more than us, Granddad?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
I guess you never heard
the phrase "Yes, we can."

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Hey, hey,
what's going on, fam?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's my God-given right
as an inmate

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Lando, I'm afraid
we gonna have to,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
to have a white bitch.
That's not a God-given right

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
uh, make some changes.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
From now on,
no smoking.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
for an inmate.
Or anyone else, really.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
What?
And no more drinking.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh. Well, I may not have
a God-given right

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Not at home. You're setting
a bad example for the boys.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Why don't you understand me
for a change?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
to white bitches.
But I do have a God-given right

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Why can't you accept me
for who the fuck I am?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
to ask for white bitches.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You can't control my life!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Hey, man, the nigga
do have a point.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I hate you! I never want
to see you again!

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Hey, he's right.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Motion to add
"white bitches"

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I wish I was never
your son!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
to the official list
of demands.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Everyone in favor?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm sorry, Pops, I ain't
even mean that shit, man.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Motion passes.
Please add

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It's just, my anger
got the best of me,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
"white bitches" to the official
list of demands.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
and I'll do whatever
you say, man,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Okay, next motion.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
from here on out, man.
It's-- I need that.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You know, I-I-I need
that discipline.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That tough love,
you know?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Don't--
Don't spare the rod on me.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Matter of fact, man,
I'm going upstairs

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
and get ready for
my ass-whupping right now.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
CONVICT:
I'm telling you

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
they getting bitches in here.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
As soon as they get
the bitches in here

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'll stop tapping your ass.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Left side, nigga.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Whatever.
What you gonna do, nigga?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Okay, so the list
so far is: "Bitches.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Just watch your ass, nigga.
Ball.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Watch your ass. Nigga.
Ah!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
"White bitches, Asian bitches,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
"Brazilian bitches,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
"East Indian Bitches,
West Indian Bitches...

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Ha! Game, bitch.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Who's the number two
nigga now, nigga?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Ruckus! Come on!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Nigga, you 7 feet tall

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
"Broadband internet porn,
K-Y Jelly, Condoms,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
bragging about beating
a little kid.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Your game is garbage.
And you cheat.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Viagra,  People  magazine,
and Alaskan bitches."

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
That's how it's
a fair match, nigga.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm 7 feet garbage,
and you 3 feet nice.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Isn't there anything else
you guys want?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
All right, that's true.
New game, nigga.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You may never get
this chance again.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Anything else?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I thought that's what
the magazine was for.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
RUCKUS:
Huh?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
No. I'm gonna knock
that down too.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Ah!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
What about an end
to the outsourcing

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Ah! Lando. Lando!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
of prison labor
to private companies?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I like that.
Yeah, yeah. That's not bad.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
What if we keep doing
the work

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
but they pay us
in white bitches?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
CONVICT 3:
Yo, that's crazy.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
You! You the one
been all over the neighborhood

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Man, white bitches.
CONVICT 4: I'd work my ass off.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
trying to undercut
my business.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You see this?
Take a good look at it.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I tried to wipe my ass
with it

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Come on.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
RUCKUS:
Follow him,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
white children.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
except it chafed my gentle
under region.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Niggas know they way
through prison.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You ever heard of free-market
principles, nigga?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Best, you know what? I'd love
to be paid in white bitches.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You can't have no motherfucking
handyman monopoly

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
out this motherfucker.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Whoa, look who brought
his no-appointment-keeping

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Hey, yo, nigga!
Where the hostages?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
black white ass
around here.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Ah-ha.  Et tu,  Robert? Et tu?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Thank God.
Is everyone all right?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
There's a service exit
not far from here.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Now, Robert, I know you mad,
but I never thought

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Aw, my precious
little white children.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
you would stoop this low.
Ah.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I told you, y'all would be safe

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Ruckus, that's enough.
This is your own fault.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
with your Uncle Ruckus.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Ruckus, where's Huey
and Riley?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Lando is serious about
this landscaping business

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Where they belong,
with the convicts.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
and I'm supporting him.
He's good at it,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
You left Huey and Riley?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
and I'm proud of him.
Pops, you mean that?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Course I did.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I do, son.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Fine. I hope you niggas
are happy with each other.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
You guys go ahead.
I've gotta go back.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Aw, Pops.
You don't even know

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Tom! Tom, are you crazy?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
what that meant to a nigga
right now.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Tom! Stay away
from that tossed-salad guy!

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
For the first time in my life,
I understand

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
the true meaning of family--
And one more thing.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
You got peanut allergies!

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
George Lucas ruined
the  Star Wars  franchise

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
CONVICT 1: You! I'm talking to you!

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
the minute
that wavy-haired jigaboo

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
stepped on screen
and put his monkey paws

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
all over Princess Leia.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The booty is mine.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It belongs to me.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Didn't I tell you?
Ha, Look at us.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
One big,
beautiful black family.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Hm.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I know you smiling
on the inside.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
MAN:

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I can tell, nigga.
I can tell.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
You can't bullshit
big baby brother, nigga.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
You just as gleeful
as a motherfucker, huh?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Ow!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So you wanna do it
the hard way, huh?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I got it for you hard.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Ugh!
Don't drop the soap, Tom!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Okay, gang,
food is just about ready.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
And turn that damn thing off.
You know how I feel

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
about that Steve Wilkos show.
Okay, Pops,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
we fit to turn it off. Hakeem, you are the father,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I want that booty, Tom.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You can't have my booty.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, yeah, I can.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
The booty is mine,
it belongs to me,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
and I hate your fucking guts!

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
you cannot take my booty.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
The booty is mine,
it belongs to me,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I cannot believe this.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
you cannot take my booty.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I knew it. I knew it.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I knew he was
the baby daddy.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Man,
I-I knew that shit too.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Wait, stop.
Freeze it.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
All right,
bring it back. There.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
"Producers reserve the right

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
"reverse and/or otherwise

Mm-hm.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000

"Actual DNA test

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Mm-hm, come on, Tom.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Huh?
Aw.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
HUEY:
Hi, yeah, um,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
we're calling about

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
the DNA test
for Robert Freeman.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, the "Near Death
Deadbeat" episode.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Mm-hm. Okay.
Thanks.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You can't have it!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Granddad,
you're not the father.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Ah, man!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yo! Them niggas left without us.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Ain't that a bitch.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Aw, man. For real?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Whose job was it to watch
the motherfucking hostages?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
You mean we just did
all that bonding for nothing?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You forgot to assign
it to someone,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
No, i-it wasn't
for nothing.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Mr. Chief Motherfucking
Executive.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I mean--
Slow down, playboy.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You don't have
to say nothing, really.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Did y'all know about this?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
If we did, do you think
we'd still be here?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Huey, Riley,
what can I say, man?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What are we gonna do
with demands and no hostages?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Nigga really appreciate
y'all for opening your own home,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
We got them.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
but if we ain't family,
what we doing this for?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Man, we won't get
any strategic leverage

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
with them two.
I motion we end the riot,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
I ain't gotta be sharing no room
with two little boys,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
disband the Executive
Riot Committee,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I ain't know no King of Pop
shit. I'll just beat it.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
and surrender to authorities.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Okay. All in favor
of ending the riot.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
So, what are you going
to do now, son?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Motion passes.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I mean, Lando?
Who knows?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
CONVICT 2:
Wait a minute,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
let me get this right.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Maybe I'll find
that right lady, you know,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Do the, uh,
jelly go inside your ass?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
You know, I spend
a lot of time, you know,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
start a family of my own.
This was kinda cool.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
All right,
you little niggas be easy.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
thinking about all the shit
I could've done.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I mean, I wake up
in the morning and I think,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You listen
to your granddaddy.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I could've been
the motherfucking president.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
You real lucky
to have him.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Shit.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Nigga, I wish
things had've been different.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
I mean, I'd do anything
in the motherfucking world

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
just for things
to be different.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You all right?
Yeah. Whew.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Glad that's over. I really
dodged a bullet there.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I guess I'm just gonna be
raping niggas' asses

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
He wasn't a bad guy,
though.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
for the rest
of my motherfucking life.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I hope he does find
his real daddy one day.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
International star
and Colt 45 spokesperson

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Billy Dee Williams?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Yes, you must be
Robert Freeman.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
I saw you on  The Steve Wilkos Show  with Lando,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Boys! Boys, are you okay?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah. Are you okay?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
but I'm afraid I've got
some pretty shocking news.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Yes. Heh. I'm okay.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
He's not your son.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
For the first time
in a long time, I'm okay.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
We know that.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
How do you know that?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Of course you okay. You ran.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because he's my son.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
How a chaperone
gonna run, Mr. DuBois? Huh?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Your son?
What?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
You mean,
you and Marietta...?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Yes.
She sent me a letter,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
"Leave the kids, save yourself?"

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Is that what chaperoning
mean to you?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
must have been right before
she passed.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Pfft. I can't believe
this is supposed to scare me.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I've been trying to find him,
but I couldn't

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
until I saw him
on your show.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
A prison full
of bitch-ass niggas.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Is he here?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
That way.
If you hurry

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
The convicts is bitch-ass
niggas. All they did was vote.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
you might catch him.
Thanks.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
The COs was bitch-ass niggas,
'cause they just fell over.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Man, I wish I could be
related to Billy Dee Williams.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And, Tom, you's a bitch-ass
nigga too.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Because all you did was run.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
He way cooler than you,
Granddad.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
They wouldn't know what to do

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
with a real nigga like me
up in here.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Guess that's why he get
all the bitches first.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Lucky for them
I'm a little kid

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
GRANDDAD:
Boys, it's a great day

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
for yard work.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
so they can't put me
in a real jail.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They gotta put me
in a jail for, like,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
real nigga little kids.
