00:07.740 --> 00:08.760
That's a good one.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.090
And now even bigger.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.430
But that one got off nicely.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.430
Merciful mercies,
what is taking so long?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.460
Sorry, Majesty, just securing
these balloons onto your...

00:20.050 --> 00:22.000
Super comfy pamper time
floaty throne?

00:22.130 --> 00:24.810
Super comfy pamper time
floaty throne?

00:24.940 --> 00:26.410
Sure, let's go with that.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.880
All right, let's get the pampering
over with.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.280
Oh, yeah, baby. Thrashy-thrashy.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.520
That's right, groom me.

00:38.650 --> 00:40.260
Groom me like you mean it.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.090
Give me all the grooming you've got.

00:44.190 --> 00:47.560
Only one set of hands is fitting
to be touching the royal feet.

00:47.950 --> 00:49.060
And that is...

00:50.010 --> 00:51.800
the hands of the King himself.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.710
There, it is time to be beholding

01:10.840 --> 01:12.650
the shiny clean
and perfectly polished

01:12.940 --> 01:13.700
royal...

01:15.250 --> 01:16.730
Not the minty fresh King feet.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.790
You have all been called here
to dig a royal proclamation

01:38.990 --> 01:41.120
from King Julien himself.

01:41.780 --> 01:43.910
30 peanuts says
this is about his feet.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.500
- Make it 40.
- Deal.

01:47.490 --> 01:50.290
From this moment,
that is happening now and on,

01:50.530 --> 01:53.920
those who touch the King's feet,
which are mine,

01:54.140 --> 01:56.700
will be punished most savagely.

01:57.970 --> 01:59.300
I drew that. I did.

01:59.610 --> 02:01.760
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, man.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.940
No feet?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.770
Well, that's five minutes of our lives
we're not getting back.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.039
Until I get my time machine
fully functioning.

02:09.430 --> 02:13.210
Wait, this is a serious proclamation
that I am proclaiming.

02:14.070 --> 02:17.390
Look, it is posted right here
on the plastic volcano.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.690
And anyone who dares
to be touching my beautiful feets,

02:21.960 --> 02:25.080
shall be banished from my kingdom.

02:25.210 --> 02:28.480
- Forever!
- Ever, ever, ever.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.430
- What are you doing?
- Echoing you for dramatic effect.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.570
Nice, I like it.

02:32.930 --> 02:35.960
Now, go to rebuilding my super comfy
pamper time floaty throne.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.020
And make it floatier
and super-duper comfy.

02:40.210 --> 02:42.110
Banished forever?

02:42.470 --> 02:44.580
- Forever.
- Ever, ever, ever.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.070
Must not think about feet.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.980
Must count sheep.

03:03.690 --> 03:04.650
Sheep!

03:04.770 --> 03:06.200
One, two-nien,

03:07.540 --> 03:08.540
three.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.090
Feet, Mort.

03:11.310 --> 03:12.790
Must count feet.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.050
Not the feet.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.780
But I must touch.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.960
That's good. Much better.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.550
What in the feets are you doing?

03:46.110 --> 03:47.580
I... Wait, you have to... I...

03:47.710 --> 03:48.710
You, you, you

03:49.010 --> 03:52.380
are hereby banished from my Kingdom

03:52.510 --> 03:53.780
forever!

03:56.590 --> 03:58.890
Ever, ever, ever...
What? Wait,

03:59.180 --> 04:01.420
do you meant that Mort is exiled
for eternity?

04:01.730 --> 04:04.810
Forever or for eternity.
I'm flexible.

04:04.930 --> 04:07.660
But the no feet-touching law
must be of zero tolerance.

04:17.579 --> 04:20.910
You cannot escape us, Mort.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.530
Hug us.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.510
We need hugs.

04:25.010 --> 04:25.850
Get away!

04:26.180 --> 04:27.020
Go away!

04:31.750 --> 04:34.690
I heard about the whole
foot banishing thing.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.930
- And if there's anything I can do...
- Trust me, cure me, fix me, save me.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.220
Whoa, okay, I'm an otter,
not a miracle worker.

04:41.350 --> 04:44.770
But I do know someone
who takes the hard cases.

04:46.910 --> 04:47.870
No, Marlene,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.110
we're not accepting new recruits
at this time.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.440
Come on, have a heart.

04:52.610 --> 04:55.750
No, thank you. Besides,
Mort wouldn't pass our psych screening.

04:55.870 --> 04:58.910
How Rico slipped through
is still shrouded in mystery.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.140
Mort really isn't that bad,
are you, Mort?

05:12.110 --> 05:13.680
Okay, yeah, he is that bad.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.720
But that's why he needs you.
You're the only one who can help him.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.500
You are a role model.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.790
You are a natural leader.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.900
Well, guilty as charged.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.340
Me... Help me.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.490
Sad eyes, fall in now.

05:29.470 --> 05:33.070
Recruit, I'm gonna mold you
like a lump of wet clay.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.740
Yeah, have fun with that.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.630
Oh, goody. I'm wet clay.

05:42.110 --> 05:44.890
What's that, Mr. Foot?
You want a hug?

05:47.220 --> 05:48.430
All right, hug then...

05:50.870 --> 05:51.910
If you must...

05:57.340 --> 05:59.050
If you insist on hug.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.680
Did... I... do... good?

06:06.750 --> 06:07.750
Say it with me.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.450
They're just feet, not love.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.110
They're just feet, not love.

06:17.330 --> 06:18.960
What's that?
You want a hug?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.430
No, no hug for you.

06:23.540 --> 06:24.610
Say "please."

06:26.320 --> 06:29.000
Sure is empty around here
without Mort.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.210
- Yes, and quiet.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet...

06:34.090 --> 06:36.190
I do not miss him one little bit.

06:36.970 --> 06:38.840
Your Majesty,
you don't really mean...

06:40.120 --> 06:42.090
I am not hearing the "bfff".

06:42.210 --> 06:43.530
Without the "bfff",

06:43.660 --> 06:46.550
my super comfy pamper time
floaty throne will just sit here,

06:47.000 --> 06:48.570
and be a stupid chair

06:48.910 --> 06:49.960
on the ground.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.380
No, no hug for you

06:53.500 --> 06:54.700
or you.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.870
Don't look at me like that.
All right...

07:03.410 --> 07:06.470
When I find the wise acre
who took my shoe,

07:06.690 --> 07:07.660
I'm gonna...

07:10.650 --> 07:13.600
<i>Quickly. Prolonged exposure
could contaminate the entire sector.</i>

07:13.920 --> 07:15.650
<i>This is for your own good, Mort.</i>

07:16.340 --> 07:18.650
I want to hug it.
But I shouldn't.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.620
<i>You'll do more than hug it, recruit.
Rico, engage.</i>

07:26.690 --> 07:29.380
Enjoy the feet... bad.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.430
<i>It worked!</i>

07:32.970 --> 07:33.800
Bad feet.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.450
Bad feet.

07:42.990 --> 07:44.380
Sweet foot!

07:45.460 --> 07:46.280
Hug this!

07:50.700 --> 07:52.280
He's violent... but cured.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.860
Like a Christmas ham.

07:54.370 --> 07:57.080
He is 100% lemur-foot-phobic.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.680
He won't even be touching
his own toes.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.500
Skipper, look.

08:05.020 --> 08:07.400
Help, I am in need of helping.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.390
Gaing altitude at the current rate,
and given the cross wind,

08:11.510 --> 08:13.910
I project the balloons
will be punctured

08:14.250 --> 08:15.890
in 22.6 seconds.

08:18.470 --> 08:20.320
Hot dog!
Ringtail's in trouble.

08:21.530 --> 08:23.250
Suit up, men.
You too, private.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.550
I'm Private!

08:24.930 --> 08:26.220
He's private number two.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.990
I like number two.

08:35.049 --> 08:37.429
Operation "luft balloons"...
is a go.

08:42.090 --> 08:44.310
What? Hot, hot, hot.
Help.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.080
Cheese and crackers!
Struggling will just make it worse.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.820
I cannot hear you over my frantic
and panicked struggling.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.950
Hold still.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.660
Almost got you.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.970
I got you.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.840
What is with the stopping?
Yank me into safety already.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.370
King Julien feet... bad.

09:18.540 --> 09:19.340
What?

09:20.830 --> 09:21.740
Feet good.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.400
Please, I never thought i'd say this,
but touch my feet!

09:24.680 --> 09:25.750
Grab them.

09:26.030 --> 09:29.580
The boy will never touch
Julien's feet again in his life.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.720
Hug my feet.
Squeeze them.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.960
He is 100% lemur-foot-phobic.

09:37.150 --> 09:38.690
Mort, love them.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.160
They're just feet, not love.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.000
Feet!

09:48.890 --> 09:51.470
- This is about feet again, isn't it?
- Déjà vu.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.530
We tried to make Mort foot-phobic,
but we failed.

09:54.650 --> 09:56.380
Ironically, if not for our failure,

09:56.500 --> 10:00.320
Julien would be sleeping
with the hot dogs.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.220
- Dead.
- Exactly.

10:03.390 --> 10:04.710
That's not failure.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.490
That's redefined objectives.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.570
Right.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.150
Attention, people.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.500
I am hereby decreeing

10:12.620 --> 10:15.860
that my new no-feet-touching decree

10:15.980 --> 10:19.070
is a decree
I am un-decreeing forever.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.120
Ever, ever, ever.

10:31.820 --> 10:32.640
What?

10:33.580 --> 10:34.760
Okay, fine.

10:35.090 --> 10:38.350
I officially thank Mort for saving me,
welcome back to the Kingdom, bla, bla.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.580
I'm home!

10:40.700 --> 10:41.690
Not the feet.

10:44.070 --> 10:46.590
Fine, I shall be permitting one hug.

10:47.090 --> 10:48.460
How bad could one hug be?

10:52.950 --> 10:53.850
It's bad.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.540
Bad, bad, bad...
