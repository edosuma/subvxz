00:02.172 --> 00:04.000
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> I am Shauna Rae.

00:04.034 --> 00:05.689
Hi, how are ya?
- Good, how are you?

00:05.724 --> 00:10.275
Today, I'm going to consult
with a tattooer
about an idea I have.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.551
- One of the challenges
is going to be--
- My proportion?

00:12.586 --> 00:14.137
Size and proportions.

00:14.172 --> 00:15.586
How do you feel about
something like this?

00:20.620 --> 00:21.689
Okay. I could see that.

00:21.724 --> 00:24.310
I don't want that on my arm.

00:24.344 --> 00:26.517
Hello,
how are you?
- Good, how are you?

00:26.551 --> 00:30.103
Tonight we're looking for
bridesmaid's dresses
for Tara's wedding.

00:30.137 --> 00:31.517
- Are you excited?
- No.

00:32.620 --> 00:34.413
Rude.

00:34.448 --> 00:38.172
It seems like we have
a greater age difference
than the two years.

00:38.206 --> 00:42.517
Mentally, physically,
emotionally, all the things.

00:43.206 --> 00:44.793
Good girl, Chica.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.137
We're gonna take the dogs
to a beach dog park.

00:48.172 --> 00:49.827
<i>I'm only 50 pounds.</i>

00:49.862 --> 00:53.793
If all of them come at me
at once, I may go down.

00:55.034 --> 00:58.034
<i>I've wanted to be a vet</i> <i>
since I was, like, four.</i>

00:58.068 --> 01:01.655
I never really imagined
working with larger animals
in the body I'm in.

01:01.689 --> 01:04.413
So I'm going to see
if I can find a farm
with large animals,

01:04.448 --> 01:05.931
so I can get some experience.

01:16.758 --> 01:18.758
Come on,
it's gonna be exciting.

01:18.793 --> 01:20.862
<i>As I'm working on</i> <i>
my independence,</i>

01:20.896 --> 01:24.689
<i>I've been thinking about</i> <i>
a future career</i> <i>
and how I can support myself.</i>

01:24.724 --> 01:27.655
Since Rylee and I
are both interested
in working with animals,

01:27.689 --> 01:31.724
we're going to
an equine center to shadow
the owner for the afternoon.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.344
- Welcome to Twin Lakes Farm.
Nice to meet you.

01:33.379 --> 01:35.724
- I'm Rylee.
- Rylee, pleasure to meet you.
Welcome to Twin Lakes.

01:35.758 --> 01:38.827
I want to be
a large animal veterinarian,

01:38.862 --> 01:43.000
working with horses,
cows, pigs, zoo animals.

01:43.034 --> 01:46.655
I am looking to see if I can
do things with larger animals.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.862
And if that is possible.

01:48.896 --> 01:52.241
We're gonna head into the barn
and go do some hands-on
with the horses,

01:52.275 --> 01:54.620
maybe some stall cleaning,
some horse care,
and some riding.

01:54.655 --> 01:55.793
Yes!
- Let's go.

01:55.827 --> 01:57.310
Great. Okay.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.241
<i>I have great respect</i> <i>
for horses.</i>

02:01.275 --> 02:03.448
Have a fear of horses though.

02:03.482 --> 02:07.241
Giant creature,
that could just decide,
I don't want to live anymore.

02:07.275 --> 02:09.517
Like it could just be like,
hey you, no more living,

02:09.551 --> 02:11.931
and kick me and I die.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.827
So,
welcome to the pony barn.
The pony barn.

02:14.862 --> 02:18.758
I first interacted
with a horse
when I was in Girl Scouts,

02:18.793 --> 02:20.965
so I was probably like seven.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.137
Um, it was just a normal
horse ride.

02:23.172 --> 02:26.931
But, I kinda
fell in love with horses.

02:26.965 --> 02:28.379
They're so gentle.

02:28.413 --> 02:32.620
And if you're
as respectful to them
they'll be respectful to you.

02:32.655 --> 02:34.586
It just makes them
amazing altogether.

02:35.275 --> 02:37.103
Tell me, how old are you guys?

02:37.137 --> 02:39.206
- I'm 18.
- I'm 22.

02:40.103 --> 02:41.275
- You're 22?
- Yeah.

02:41.965 --> 02:43.551
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:43.586 --> 02:45.620
- All right,
I'll take your word for it.
- Okay.

02:46.965 --> 02:50.310
I didn't even notice
that Scott was really asking,

02:50.344 --> 02:53.068
like, a question to make sure
that I was 22.

02:53.655 --> 02:57.241
She was livid.

02:57.275 --> 02:59.965
It tends to be
my least favorite answer,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.931
is the one
where they don't believe.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.034
<i>He was more bubbly,</i> <i>
so I was fine.</i>

03:05.068 --> 03:06.758
Do you want to put
the halter on Frisbee for me?

03:06.793 --> 03:07.862
Oh, yeah.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.137
My first impression of Shauna
when I met her?

03:10.172 --> 03:12.793
She reminded me of my five
or six year old daughter.

03:12.827 --> 03:15.724
See.
- I did not expect her age
to be what it was.

03:17.172 --> 03:18.344
You guys ready
to clean the stalls?

03:19.793 --> 03:21.241
There's so much
of it.

03:21.275 --> 03:27.344
Mucking a stall
is removing all of the poop
from a horses stall.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.206
And leaving them
with a clean stall.

03:29.827 --> 03:32.275
It's like having 15 cats.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.137
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:37.689
the pitchfork I used
was way too big for my body.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.689
But, I got it done.

03:40.724 --> 03:42.724
I did as good as I could.

03:42.758 --> 03:45.103
So, are you excited
to ride a horse?

03:45.137 --> 03:47.172
No, I'm scared
to ride a horse.

03:47.206 --> 03:49.482
I think you'll enjoy it today.

03:50.586 --> 03:52.862
I... I might enjoy it.
I love animals.

03:52.896 --> 03:55.172
I do love animals.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.965
It's a good thing
we're paying you by the stall
and not by the hour.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
We're being thorough,
I don't see the issue.

04:02.758 --> 04:06.344
After we filled
our wheelbarrows
we had to go up a giant hill

04:06.379 --> 04:08.275
and dump them into a dumpster.

04:09.034 --> 04:10.103
You got it, Shaun.

04:12.413 --> 04:14.551
<i>The wheelbarrow,</i> <i>
also giant.</i>

04:15.724 --> 04:17.793
<i>Which is fine, and I tried,</i>

04:17.827 --> 04:20.793
but, like, I didn't know
we had to wheelbarrow
up a hill.

04:22.241 --> 04:24.655
Right, you're gonna
come straight in the back
of the container

04:24.689 --> 04:25.551
and dump it in.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.551
There we go.

04:28.206 --> 04:29.896
Is it all out?

04:29.931 --> 04:31.758
When you tip it back,
you can look down and see.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.241
- Yeah, it's not.
Oh, little more.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.068
See, this is a
tall person thing.

04:37.620 --> 04:41.413
I do like that he's
not really trying to help me
too much.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.241
Um, might as be the fact
that I've dealt
with horses before,

04:44.275 --> 04:46.275
and I've actually
done this before
and Rylee hasn't.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.724
Will you walk faster.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.344
I thought I was
walking a little too fast,
but, okay.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.551
<i>The wheelbarrow</i> <i>
posed a challenge.</i>

04:57.586 --> 04:59.448
<i>But, I got it done.</i>

04:59.482 --> 05:01.758
If I need help,
I will ask for it.

05:01.793 --> 05:03.344
And I'm going to
struggle for...

05:03.379 --> 05:06.103
I would struggle for an hour
before I'd ask for help.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.827
So, Shauna you're interested
in some of the health care

05:10.862 --> 05:13.137
- and the horsemanship
part of it.
- Yes.

05:13.172 --> 05:16.275
When we give shots to horses,
generally it's given
in two places.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.000
On the left side of his neck.

05:18.034 --> 05:19.275
When we do vaccinations,

05:19.310 --> 05:21.275
there's three muscle groups,
the one that goes here,

05:21.310 --> 05:24.137
- his shoulders here,
and the muscle here.
- Okay.

05:24.172 --> 05:27.517
If we give
an intermuscular shot,
we put it right here.

05:27.551 --> 05:30.620
Shauna did express to me
her interest in working around
the horses,

05:30.655 --> 05:33.103
especially in the medical
or veterinarian realm.

05:33.689 --> 05:35.206
It would be difficult.

05:35.241 --> 05:38.206
It's not impossible,
she could definitely assist
with the veterinarian.

05:38.241 --> 05:41.517
<i>But many of the things may be</i> <i>
physically out of her reach.</i>

05:41.551 --> 05:43.241
So, that's where I would
give him a shot now,

05:43.275 --> 05:46.137
- so he gets a little sleepy
so we can body clip him.
- Okay.

05:46.172 --> 05:49.448
<i>There are</i> <i>
a lot of things that my size</i> <i>
can affect</i>

05:49.482 --> 05:51.620
<i>when it comes to</i> <i>
dealing with large animals,</i>

05:51.655 --> 05:54.172
giving birth with the animal,

05:54.206 --> 05:57.000
helping the animal,
checking it's
intestinal track,

05:57.034 --> 06:00.310
all of that requires
longer limbs.

06:01.413 --> 06:02.517
And I don't have those.

06:03.793 --> 06:05.827
So we're ready
to start the clippers
when Henry is ready.

06:05.862 --> 06:06.827
Should I
go over there?

06:06.862 --> 06:07.931
I would stay
on that side, yeah.

06:10.344 --> 06:14.344
<i>So we're going to</i> <i>
body clip Yoda and Snowflake.</i>

06:14.379 --> 06:16.862
Which is basically
giving a haircut to a horse.

06:16.896 --> 06:17.724
Yep.

06:19.517 --> 06:23.827
You need to body clip a horse
because they grow
a winter coat

06:23.862 --> 06:27.517
and if they are being used

06:27.551 --> 06:30.206
those activities
make them sweaty.

06:30.241 --> 06:31.758
Brush that hair
out of the way.
There we go.

06:32.344 --> 06:33.344
On the job.

06:39.068 --> 06:42.206
<i>It was difficult</i> <i>
clipping the horse.</i>

06:42.241 --> 06:44.172
Why are you so tall!

06:45.793 --> 06:47.586
<i>The clippers</i> <i>
were a little heavy.</i>

06:47.620 --> 06:51.413
<i>And I probably needed a block</i> <i>
to see the top of the horse.</i>

06:51.448 --> 06:54.172
<i>Because I could only do</i> <i>
the side and the belly.</i>

06:55.103 --> 06:56.137
But, I still did it.

06:57.862 --> 06:59.000
Ready? Come on.

07:00.034 --> 07:01.103
It's a big horse.

07:03.275 --> 07:05.206
You're gonna come
and meet Natalie, our teacher.

07:05.241 --> 07:07.482
- Hello.
Hello.

07:07.517 --> 07:10.034
- I'm Shauna.
- Hi, I'm Natalie.

07:10.068 --> 07:12.206
We can come
right over here with Hersey.

07:13.241 --> 07:16.931
After clipping the horses,
we're gonna go ride!

07:16.965 --> 07:21.689
I'm terrified.
This is the part that I really
didn't wanna do.

07:21.724 --> 07:23.448
Very scared.

07:23.482 --> 07:25.793
- All right,
you can jump on up.
- Okay.

07:25.827 --> 07:29.068
All right, and you're gonna
hold your reins
in your left hand.

07:29.103 --> 07:32.068
And jump right on up.
Good jump.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.103
- And these stirrups
are far too long for you.
Yes.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.620
Okay, you've got him.

07:38.655 --> 07:40.620
Let's give him a big kick.

07:40.655 --> 07:43.379
As Hersey
is accustomed to having
taller humans ride him.

07:43.413 --> 07:45.620
Yeah,
I can completely understand.

07:45.655 --> 07:47.827
<i>Hersey, the larger horse,</i>

07:47.862 --> 07:50.310
couldn't feel me kick
because I was kicking

07:50.344 --> 07:52.103
the leather sides
of the saddle.

07:52.137 --> 07:54.655
Come on.
Keep going.

07:55.413 --> 07:57.068
So it made it all
very difficult

07:57.103 --> 07:59.620
to try and even get Hersey
to trot for me.

07:59.655 --> 08:02.034
And ask Hersey
to halt.

08:02.068 --> 08:04.000
Okay,
you can take both feet out.

08:04.034 --> 08:06.551
I'm... I'm getting nervous.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.896
That's a big horse.
And it's not listening
to Shauna.

08:10.517 --> 08:12.000
Why would it listen to me?

08:12.034 --> 08:14.862
Ready? Okay, you're gonna
come around
the front of Herse.

08:18.758 --> 08:22.206
I am petrified
when I have to get on Hersey.

08:22.241 --> 08:24.172
Uh, he's a giant horse.

08:25.344 --> 08:26.620
Um,

08:26.655 --> 08:29.310
never been on a horse,
don't know how to
get on a horse.

08:29.827 --> 08:31.965
And he's... Big.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.482
- Jump right on up.
Sorry buddy!

08:35.517 --> 08:37.482
That's okay.
He felt none of it.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.862
You want your toes
to point forward
with your heel down.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.482
You looked so tense up there.

08:43.517 --> 08:45.206
- Yeah.
- It was so funny.

08:45.241 --> 08:47.137
He was a big horse.

08:47.172 --> 08:50.724
Hands forward
and try to sit up and back.
- Okay.

08:50.758 --> 08:52.827
Right,
the taller you sit,

08:52.862 --> 08:54.344
the more balanced
you're gonna be.

08:54.379 --> 08:57.655
For her first time riding
I think she's doing okay.

08:57.689 --> 08:59.862
She's been scared all day,
but she's doing it.

08:59.896 --> 09:02.620
Good,
you're doing it.
Hands forward, sit back.

09:04.206 --> 09:06.379
There ya go.
You did it.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.551
- I never relaxed on the horse.
- No.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.620
I never comfortable
on the horse.

09:10.655 --> 09:13.517
It was very high up.
I keep feeling like
I was gonna fall.

09:13.551 --> 09:16.103
- Oh, gosh.
There ya go.
You made it.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.517
That's so scary.

09:17.551 --> 09:20.586
You did well
with the trot.
- Thanks.

09:20.620 --> 09:24.241
Shauna is definitely
the fearless sister.

09:24.275 --> 09:26.724
She can go with me
and nothing...

09:26.758 --> 09:28.206
She won't be afraid
of anything.

09:28.241 --> 09:30.689
I'll be like,
we gotta go to the movies,

09:30.724 --> 09:32.413
and we gotta order...
She's like, I got it!

09:32.448 --> 09:34.620
You ready to go back?
Ready?

09:34.655 --> 09:38.655
<i>It really depends on</i> <i>
the situation on who's more</i> <i>
confident though.</i>

09:38.689 --> 09:41.275
She definitely is the more

09:41.310 --> 09:45.241
confident one when it comes to
people and my disability.

09:45.275 --> 09:48.172
Like the confidence one's
normally the protector
of the day.

09:52.655 --> 09:55.793
<i>Being at</i> <i>
the equine center and working</i> <i>
with those horses</i>

09:55.827 --> 09:59.448
does push me
to wanna work with animals
more in a field.

09:59.482 --> 10:02.275
It's still
a little intimidating.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.034
Mucking the stall
was all heavy lifting,

10:05.068 --> 10:09.000
and it's not
very short person accessible.

10:09.034 --> 10:11.000
Well done.
- Thanks.

10:11.034 --> 10:13.689
But overall
it was just fun.

10:13.724 --> 10:15.862
Like, I just enjoyed it
so much.

10:17.103 --> 10:21.241
I think the next step
for me to follow,

10:21.275 --> 10:24.137
um, veterinarian science
as an actually career
would either be

10:24.172 --> 10:26.793
looking into colleges
or looking into
veterinarian clinics

10:26.827 --> 10:30.172
that would let me
come there and volunteer.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.448
I'm so proud of you!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.448
- Hello.
Hi.

10:35.482 --> 10:39.448
I recently saw a physician
and they suggested
that I go to an OB-GYN

10:39.482 --> 10:42.172
so I can get some more answers
on my reproductive health.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.586
Can I ask you a little bit
about relationships?

10:44.620 --> 10:49.000
I started dating again
and kids are a big
determining factor

10:49.034 --> 10:50.551
of whether
you're with someone.

10:50.586 --> 10:53.275
I've been told
I can't do a lot of things
my entire life.

10:54.206 --> 10:56.413
So being told
I can't do another thing

10:56.448 --> 10:58.586
might make me a little angry.

11:10.620 --> 11:11.620
- Hello.
Hi.

11:11.655 --> 11:12.896
- Are you checking in?
- Yeah.

11:12.931 --> 11:15.344
I recently went on a date
with Abraham.

11:15.379 --> 11:17.758
- We should do this again.
- Yeah, we can hang out again.

11:17.793 --> 11:19.172
Yes, that would be awesome.

11:19.206 --> 11:21.379
<i>And we're still</i> <i>
keeping in touch.</i>

11:21.413 --> 11:22.862
I'm not sure where
it's gonna go

11:22.896 --> 11:25.241
but I'm open to the idea
of it going somewhere.

11:25.275 --> 11:30.758
<i>So, that lead to me thinking</i> <i>
about my future</i> <i>
and my reproductive health.</i>

11:30.793 --> 11:34.586
Just because
if I can't have babies

11:34.620 --> 11:36.965
it's kind of something
you need to tell someone
up front.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.241
46 inches.

11:41.275 --> 11:46.103
I'm specifically going to see
a pediatric gynecologist
just because of my size.

11:46.517 --> 11:47.862
49.6.

11:47.896 --> 11:51.172
<i>And also,</i> <i>
she's dealt with</i> <i>
chemo patients before.</i>

11:51.206 --> 11:54.413
So she'll understand how
the chemo therapy and,

11:54.448 --> 11:57.172
maybe even,
the cancer has affected
my fertility.

11:57.206 --> 11:58.379
Knock, knock.
- Hi.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.137
- Dr. Cardamone,
nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:00.172 --> 12:02.137
You're Shauna right?
I've been doing fist bumps
these days.

12:02.172 --> 12:03.862
- Since we can't
Shake hands.

12:03.896 --> 12:06.137
Can't shake hands, exactly.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.103
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you,
too.

12:08.137 --> 12:11.620
Now, Shauna I'm gonna have you
tell me your background
and your story.

12:11.655 --> 12:15.000
- I know you've probably
told it many, many times.
- It's fine.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.896
- It's okay.
I've just memorized it.
- Great.

12:17.931 --> 12:20.517
As a baby, I was diagnosed
with brain cancer

12:20.551 --> 12:24.000
and because of
the chemo therapy
my growth was stunted.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.137
<i>When I've</i> <i>
previously seen doctors,</i>

12:26.172 --> 12:29.793
they all thought
I could have a baby,
given my size and everything.

12:29.827 --> 12:33.068
But no one actually
checked into my fertility.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.344
Do you know what kinds
of chemo therapy you had?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.103
- No.
- Do you know
the names of them?

12:37.137 --> 12:39.793
I don't.
That was never mentioned to me
by my mother.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.068
The main reason
I ask really is that,

12:42.103 --> 12:45.827
some types of chemo therapy,
more than others,

12:45.862 --> 12:48.931
can affect things
like ovaries, right,
in how they work.

12:50.689 --> 12:52.482
<i>There's kind of</i> <i>
two sides to think about</i>

12:52.517 --> 12:53.965
<i>when it comes specifically</i> <i>
to Shauna.</i>

12:54.000 --> 12:56.275
Both her pituitary,

12:56.310 --> 13:00.310
which it seems
that really the damage
to her pituitary was,

13:00.344 --> 13:02.689
<i>seems to be</i> <i>
specifically related</i> <i>
to growth hormones.</i>

13:02.724 --> 13:06.586
But also the chemo therapy
may have affected her ovaries.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.310
And that really depends
on what type
of chemo therapy it was,

13:10.344 --> 13:12.655
the dose, also,
age plays a role.

13:12.689 --> 13:15.413
And it's actually beneficial
for her that she was so young
at the time.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.482
<i>I didn't know</i> <i>
that chemo therapy</i> <i>
affects your ovaries.</i>

13:20.517 --> 13:23.724
Just because it wasn't
a predominate for my doctors

13:23.758 --> 13:27.241
back when I went through chemo
or back when I was getting
my checkups.

13:27.275 --> 13:32.862
No one really
raised a question on
if I can actually make a baby.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.206
It was just, oh,
she can probably
have a baby.

13:35.241 --> 13:36.827
It's just gotta
be a c-section.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.068
Can I ask you a little bit
about relationships?

13:40.103 --> 13:43.000
Are you in any relationships?
Are you seeing anyone?

13:43.034 --> 13:45.310
I'm not really seeing anyone.

13:45.344 --> 13:47.137
When I was sexually active
a year ago,

13:47.172 --> 13:50.310
- it was only one person,
and it was a male.
- Okay.

13:50.344 --> 13:55.344
Thinking about
my reproductive health
is necessary.

13:55.379 --> 13:59.931
Because kids are a big
determining factor of whether
you're with someone.

13:59.965 --> 14:03.448
And if I can't have kids
and they want to have genetic,

14:03.482 --> 14:05.896
then it would be an issue.

14:05.931 --> 14:08.758
I'm okay with adoption.
I'm okay with surrogate.

14:08.793 --> 14:12.103
I am okay
with not having kids.

14:12.137 --> 14:14.793
So, depending on
the person I'm with

14:15.758 --> 14:17.724
depends on what I do.

14:17.758 --> 14:20.448
One thing we could check,
and maybe this is something,

14:20.482 --> 14:22.931
- um, to think about,
it's a blood test.
- Okay.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.103
- It's not gonna really tell us
info about your pituitary.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.413
- But it will tell us some info
about your ovaries.
- Okay.

14:33.448 --> 14:34.965
And the health of the ovaries.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.241
So, it's not exactly,
you know, gonna answer
all the questions, I think.

14:38.275 --> 14:39.448
- But--

14:39.482 --> 14:41.000
It'll answer some.

14:41.034 --> 14:45.413
I think that getting tested
for that hormone is probably
the best idea.

14:45.448 --> 14:49.586
<i>The doctor</i> <i>
recommended that I get
my blood tested for a hormone.</i>

14:49.620 --> 14:53.034
That, um, is probably
a test result

14:53.068 --> 14:55.275
I'm very anxious
about getting back.

14:56.068 --> 14:57.413
I mean,

14:57.448 --> 14:59.655
even if I don't want to
have kids one day.

14:59.689 --> 15:03.448
Being told that you can't,
is a completely different
situation.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.724
It takes away

15:06.655 --> 15:10.000
whether or not
I want that lifestyle.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.241
And I want that normal
part of my life.

15:14.275 --> 15:17.689
And if I can't have kids,
or I don't have eggs,
and I'm told that...

15:21.862 --> 15:24.000
How do I put this right.

15:24.034 --> 15:26.551
I've been told
I can't do a lot of things
my entire life.

15:27.655 --> 15:29.827
So being told
I can't do another thing

15:29.862 --> 15:32.034
might make me a little angry.

15:33.931 --> 15:37.344
Good. Okay, breath normal.
Have a little listen
to your heart here.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.896
<i>I think</i> <i>
the appointment overall</i> <i>
went really well today.</i>

15:39.931 --> 15:41.724
<i>I think, personally,</i> <i>
I learned a lot more</i>

15:41.758 --> 15:43.862
<i>than I have with</i> <i>
other gynecologists.</i>

15:43.896 --> 15:46.551
Go ahead and give me
a big swallow.
Like a big gulp.

15:46.586 --> 15:50.551
The next steps
are getting my hormones tested
for my eggs.

15:50.586 --> 15:54.379
Um, then deciding what to do
with my eggs if they are low.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.793
And then going to
a reproductive endocrinologist

15:56.827 --> 15:59.655
so I can talk to someone
who might understand
the situation more.

16:07.379 --> 16:10.758
- Are you ready?
No. Never.

16:10.793 --> 16:13.517
- Well, have you looked at all?
- No.

16:13.551 --> 16:17.620
Today we are
quizzing each other
on a written drivers test.

16:17.655 --> 16:21.758
Cause both Rylee and I
are old enough
to have our drivers license's

16:21.793 --> 16:22.965
but we don't.

16:24.137 --> 16:27.413
Oh,
I'm going to get
all of these wrong.

16:27.448 --> 16:30.965
- Well, you know
green means go, right?
- Yes.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.241
<i>I've been working</i> <i>
really hard on trying to gain</i> <i>
my independence.</i>

16:34.275 --> 16:36.517
<i>But driving</i> <i>
would be a huge step.</i>

16:36.551 --> 16:38.620
It means I can leave
the house when I want to.

16:38.655 --> 16:41.586
It means that I don't
have to wait on my parents
to take me somewhere.

16:41.620 --> 16:47.448
It means that I can actually,
you know,
act my age in a little bit.

16:47.482 --> 16:49.689
Why are you 22
and you don't know
how to drive yet?

16:51.379 --> 16:55.275
Because I'm short
and I can't touch the pedals.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.793
And if I can't
touch the pedals,
I can't drive.

16:57.827 --> 17:00.344
And in order
to touch the pedals
I need accommodations.

17:01.517 --> 17:03.448
And accommodations
are expensive.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.689
For me to drive a car
I would either need
hand controls,

17:06.724 --> 17:09.758
or foot pedal extensions
of some sort.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.517
And then I'd need a seat rise.

17:12.551 --> 17:14.448
It would probably
be a new car, too.

17:14.482 --> 17:18.310
Because you don't wanna
put it on an old model,
cause their stuff's expensive.

17:18.344 --> 17:21.862
So, lots, and lots, and lots,
and lots, and lots of money.

17:21.896 --> 17:24.310
Why are you not driving yet
and you're 18?

17:25.206 --> 17:27.241
Fear. Thanks.

17:27.275 --> 17:31.724
I was going to get my license
in Pittsburgh at 16.

17:31.758 --> 17:34.862
Um, and then here, it's 17.

17:34.896 --> 17:37.896
So, and then corona happened,
so I didn't get to.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.931
And now I'm 18
without a driver's license.

17:39.965 --> 17:42.965
And she has an extreme fear
of motor vehicles.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.862
- Trains, planes, cars,
everything.
- Anything moving.

17:46.896 --> 17:49.068
All I know is,
you're scared to drive.

17:49.103 --> 17:51.758
- I'm not, I've been--
- I have a health fear.

17:51.793 --> 17:54.517
People who fear things
are smarter.

17:54.551 --> 17:58.034
All right. You're gonna be
the dummy that just gets into
a car crash.

17:58.068 --> 18:01.655
I'm gonna be the smart one,
that takes all the precaution.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.655
<i>I've never been</i> <i>
in a crash.</i>

18:03.689 --> 18:06.862
<i>Though,</i> <i>
I'm terrified of anything.</i>

18:06.896 --> 18:08.896
Put me on a bike,
I'm still scared.

18:08.931 --> 18:11.068
Put me on a scooter,
I'm still scared.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.586
Um,

18:13.862 --> 18:16.896
I don't know why.
I think it's cause
I know I control it.

18:16.931 --> 18:19.344
And I also know
I'm very clumsy.

18:20.827 --> 18:22.068
- Ready?
- Yeah.

18:28.931 --> 18:30.482
Panic and try to stop!

18:30.517 --> 18:34.413
No, you're not
supposed to panic.
Panicking will kill you.

18:34.448 --> 18:37.551
- I panic, nobody else would.
- Do you want me
to give you a hint?

18:37.586 --> 18:40.551
It has something to do
with the direction
of the steering wheel.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.172
You try to go to
the side of the road. Right?

18:43.206 --> 18:46.137
It says,
steer in the direction
you want the wheels to go.

18:46.172 --> 18:48.413
- That's how you drive.
- I know!

18:51.689 --> 18:55.482
True or false. It's illegal
to sell ice-cream out of
a moving ice-cream truck?

18:55.517 --> 18:56.413
False.

18:58.551 --> 19:00.241
What?

19:00.275 --> 19:04.206
- You are saying,
it is legal to sell ice-cream.
- No, it says. No.

19:04.241 --> 19:06.793
- Yeah.
Out of an ice-cream truck.
- That is moving.

19:06.827 --> 19:09.241
- Oh, a moving one. No.
- There ya go.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.448
Our girls are not ready
for a driving test.

19:14.931 --> 19:17.724
And I say that
with exhaustion in my voice.

19:17.758 --> 19:20.758
I would be hesitant
to let them on a bicycle.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.965
Nice question.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.413
True or false. It's illegal
to ride your horse
on a road at night?

19:27.448 --> 19:30.551
I don't know.
The Amish people
do it all the time.

19:32.482 --> 19:34.413
<i>She had</i> <i>
all these really</i> <i>
weird questions.</i>

19:34.448 --> 19:38.655
Can you ride a horse at night
is one of the questions
she's getting mad about.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.862
I would assume
no at any point.

19:40.896 --> 19:42.724
But like,
I've ridden a horse at night.

19:42.758 --> 19:44.379
So I've failed.

19:44.413 --> 19:45.965
I passed with flying colors.

19:46.655 --> 19:48.482
- You tanked.
- That's fine.

19:49.862 --> 19:52.379
Rylee definitely did better
on the quiz.

19:52.413 --> 19:55.068
I don't think it has any real

19:56.344 --> 19:59.103
perception into how we will be
as drivers though.

19:59.137 --> 20:02.758
I think I will definitely
will probably, unfortunately,
be the better driver.

20:02.793 --> 20:05.586
You're gonna
have major road rage.

20:05.620 --> 20:08.620
- I'm--
- I'm never going to get
in the car with you.

20:08.655 --> 20:11.103
I don't think I'm ever
going to get in the car
with you.

20:13.793 --> 20:15.655
Hi, Tara.

20:15.689 --> 20:19.137
<i>This evening</i> <i>
I'm video chatting</i> <i>
with my older sister, Tara.</i>

20:19.172 --> 20:20.758
<i>Are you looking for schools?</i>

20:20.793 --> 20:23.586
I wanted to get some advice
about college.

20:23.620 --> 20:27.413
- If I could do that online
that would be easier-- <i>
- Do not do online!</i>

20:27.448 --> 20:29.379
But, I'm good at it.

20:29.413 --> 20:33.551
Shauna and Tara get along
like oil and water.

20:33.586 --> 20:36.275
Like two pissed off cats
in a sack.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.724
- Also thinking about myself. <i>
- That is not what you said.</i>

20:49.310 --> 20:51.172
Hi, Tara.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.689
<i>-Hi, Shauna.</i>
- So how've you been?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.000
<i>Fine.</i>

20:56.034 --> 20:59.655
<i>This evening</i> <i>
I'm video chatting</i> <i>
with my older sister, Tara.</i>

20:59.689 --> 21:02.551
<i>Tara currently lives</i> <i>
in Florida with her fiancé,</i> <i>
Jesse,</i>

21:02.586 --> 21:04.379
<i>while she's getting her PhD.</i>

21:05.413 --> 21:08.275
Rylee and I shadowed
the owner of a horse farm.

21:08.310 --> 21:12.103
And being able
to do the things I was able
to do at the equine center,

21:12.137 --> 21:15.793
and just having pure joy
in what I was doing,

21:15.827 --> 21:20.413
does motivate me
to further along
work with animals.

21:20.448 --> 21:23.413
So I wanted to get some advice
about college.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.068
<i>School is fine.</i>

21:26.103 --> 21:28.275
<i>School is a lot, right now.</i>

21:28.310 --> 21:29.620
But do you like it?

21:30.793 --> 21:32.206
<i>Yeah, I like it.</i>

21:32.241 --> 21:36.482
<i>I've been in school,</i> <i>
post high school,</i> <i>
for how many years?</i>

21:36.517 --> 21:38.482
- Seven.
<i>Seven.</i>

21:38.517 --> 21:41.413
- Seven. <i>
- So you kinda have to like it</i> <i>
to deal with this.</i>

21:41.448 --> 21:42.655
I don't know how you do it.

21:43.724 --> 21:45.413
<i>Are you looking for schools?</i>

21:45.448 --> 21:47.448
We might tour a college.

21:47.965 --> 21:49.310
<i>What college?</i>

21:49.344 --> 21:51.758
Um, like maybe a community

21:51.793 --> 21:56.000
or one of the medical ones
down here.

21:56.034 --> 22:00.206
I haven't pursued college
because schools
can be difficult

22:00.241 --> 22:01.862
um, to navigate.

22:01.896 --> 22:03.172
One, with a disability.

22:03.206 --> 22:06.206
But two, being disabled
and not going to an area

22:06.241 --> 22:09.655
that's well known
about the disability
or well known about you.

22:09.689 --> 22:15.689
It makes it a very awkward
and can make it a very
negative situation.

22:15.724 --> 22:20.034
I definitely think community,
one, would work well for me,
but also for Rylee.

22:20.068 --> 22:23.655
But, I mean,
if I could do that online
that would be easier.

22:23.689 --> 22:25.551
- And then just-- <i>
- Do not do online!</i>

22:26.655 --> 22:29.310
For the easy...
Okay, for the easy stuff.

22:29.344 --> 22:32.965
I think could quicken
the amount of time
I have to spend in school.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.379
But also help me
slowly progress
in the social standards.

22:37.413 --> 22:42.310
With high school
and transferring schools,
it made me realize that

22:42.344 --> 22:43.448
I'm not in a little bubble.

22:43.482 --> 22:45.310
Not everyone knows
about my condition.

22:45.344 --> 22:50.137
And I don't like to
have to explain myself
all the time.

22:50.172 --> 22:53.517
And going to college
I will have to do that,

22:53.551 --> 22:55.275
most of the time.

22:55.310 --> 23:00.724
I don't know if I'm ready
to sit or stand in front of
a classroom of like 500 people

23:01.517 --> 23:03.344
and do a presentation

23:03.379 --> 23:05.965
and still get questions
about my situation.

23:06.862 --> 23:08.724
It's just very scary.

23:08.758 --> 23:10.310
And I understand that.

23:10.344 --> 23:14.448
And yes, you definitely
have to be mentally prepared
for anything.

23:14.482 --> 23:16.965
But people are more mature.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.241
<i>You're point in quickening</i> <i>
the process is null and void,</i> <i>
cause that's not a thing.</i>

23:21.275 --> 23:23.758
I'm not trying
to quicken
the process, I said

23:23.793 --> 23:27.896
progressing slowly
in social events, Tara.

23:27.931 --> 23:30.655
- Also thinking about myself. <i>
- That is not what you said.</i>

23:30.689 --> 23:31.862
Yes, it is.

23:31.896 --> 23:35.068
Shauna and Tara
get along like, um,

23:35.862 --> 23:37.862
- Like...
-...oil and water.

23:37.896 --> 23:40.413
Like two pissed off cats
in a sack,

23:43.517 --> 23:45.482
But, I'm good at it.

23:45.517 --> 23:47.137
I had A's and B's.

23:47.172 --> 23:50.379
<i>You might have A's and B's,</i> <i>
but that's not retraining</i> <i>
the information.</i>

23:50.413 --> 23:52.172
<i>-I had--</i>
- I took forensic science

23:52.206 --> 23:54.241
and anatomy my senior
and my junior year.

23:54.275 --> 23:55.862
How much do I retain
from that?

23:55.896 --> 24:01.758
I believe that Shauna
holds some animosity
towards Tara.

24:01.793 --> 24:05.620
Um, for the path
that Tara's going on.

24:05.655 --> 24:07.586
Um, she has a fiancé,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.172
- she's...
-...bought a house.

24:09.206 --> 24:10.137
Bought a house.

24:10.172 --> 24:14.275
I mean, Shauna said, um,
just a few days ago,

24:14.310 --> 24:16.758
that if she was
two feet taller

24:17.965 --> 24:21.448
she'd already
be through school
and a vet.

24:21.482 --> 24:24.275
<i>The only way that you can</i> <i>
quicken the process</i> <i>
with school</i>

24:24.310 --> 24:30.137
<i>is if A, you have AP</i> <i>
or college and high school</i> <i>
classes that will transfer...</i>

24:30.172 --> 24:31.758
<i>Why are you laughing at me?</i>

24:34.172 --> 24:37.586
<i>You feel bored!</i> <i>
I'm trying to teach you</i> <i>
how to do this.</i>

24:37.620 --> 24:39.586
<i>Our personalities</i> <i>
are very similar.</i>

24:39.620 --> 24:43.000
We clash a lot.
Um, she knows how
to poke my buttons.

24:43.034 --> 24:45.586
And I know how to hurt her.

24:45.620 --> 24:50.620
And it doesn't always end well
for one of us.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.965
Give me six months.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.103
<i>I hope it's not because</i> <i>
we're really similar.</i>

24:54.137 --> 24:56.482
I think she's too sensitive.

24:57.551 --> 24:58.827
And I think I'm too harsh.

24:58.862 --> 24:59.689
Because

25:00.586 --> 25:02.000
she's too sensitive.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.931
And I just jab at her
a little bit.

25:04.965 --> 25:07.620
<i>-The thing you have to</i> <i>
pay out of pocket--</i>
- What's up!

25:07.655 --> 25:09.034
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

25:10.068 --> 25:11.896
<i>-Hi.</i>
- What's up?

25:11.931 --> 25:15.068
<i>-We're talking school.</i>
- I was just saying, hi.

25:15.103 --> 25:18.413
I didn't know
I was joining
a whole thing.

25:18.448 --> 25:22.068
Well, do you have any concerns
about us going to college?

25:22.103 --> 25:25.241
Like, concern for Rylee?
Concern for me?

25:25.275 --> 25:28.482
<i>No, I want you to go to</i> <i>
college and I want you to</i> <i>
get the experience.</i>

25:29.931 --> 25:33.827
Shauna gets in her head
about her size a lot.

25:34.206 --> 25:35.241
And

25:36.172 --> 25:38.896
makes that, kind of,
like an excuse.

25:38.931 --> 25:43.482
<i>But, I think Shauna is capable</i> <i>
of anything that she sets</i> <i>
her mind to.</i>

25:43.517 --> 25:46.241
As long as she doesn't
get in the way of herself.

25:47.344 --> 25:49.275
<i>And with that, I leave you.</i>

25:49.310 --> 25:50.344
Oh, okay.

25:50.379 --> 25:51.689
<i>All my knowledge.</i>

25:51.724 --> 25:53.586
Thank you
for all that knowledge.

25:54.413 --> 25:55.413
<i>You're so welcome.</i>

25:56.034 --> 25:57.689
I'm gonna go now, Tara.

25:58.241 --> 25:59.551
<i>Okay. Good-bye.</i>

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Okay, bye.

26:06.103 --> 26:07.758
Dad, hi.

26:09.517 --> 26:12.482
<i>Overall,</i> <i>
I think the chat went well.</i> <i>
Which is good.</i>

26:12.517 --> 26:16.344
Because I am seeing Tara soon
for the bachelorette party
in Pittsburgh.

26:16.379 --> 26:18.068
That was fun.

26:18.103 --> 26:22.172
I understand that if I really
want to pursue

26:22.206 --> 26:25.758
a serious career
in veterinarian science,
that I should go to school.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.482
I just don't know
if I will go about it

26:28.517 --> 26:30.413
the same way everyone else
would go about it.

26:40.758 --> 26:42.758
Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

26:42.793 --> 26:44.310
Hello.
- Welcome back, how ya doing?

26:44.344 --> 26:45.896
- This is my mother.
Hi.

26:45.931 --> 26:47.275
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.275
- I'm Patty.
- Nice to meet you.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.724
A while ago
I went to a tattoo shop

26:51.758 --> 26:54.448
to get a consultation
about a tattoo
I wanted to get.

26:55.620 --> 26:58.034
My mom is coming with me
for this tattoo,

26:58.068 --> 27:00.586
she came with me
for my first tattoo.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.103
But, specifically,
I want her there
for this tattoo

27:03.137 --> 27:04.689
because it is her father.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.689
- Are you ready? Excited?
- I am excited.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.275
- She's nervous.
- You're nervous?

27:08.310 --> 27:10.724
- Little bit.
- We'll, that's Mom's job,
right?

27:10.758 --> 27:14.448
I'm definitely okay
being there with Shauna.

27:14.482 --> 27:17.379
I've, I mean,
I've been there with
every tattoo.

27:17.413 --> 27:19.206
You know, if I can be honest,
we have a couple things

27:19.241 --> 27:21.000
that we have to kinda
really talk about.

27:21.034 --> 27:24.379
I've never really done
a tattoo for somebody
your size before.

27:24.413 --> 27:27.655
So I just wanna make sure
that we get the information
that we want to display

27:27.689 --> 27:30.379
um, responsibly
and appropriately.

27:30.413 --> 27:31.965
So we might have to make
some changes.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.241
But, I took what you
have originally given me

27:35.275 --> 27:37.793
and I came up with some
cool ideas, just need some
input from you.

27:37.827 --> 27:41.551
- Feel free to put input in.
- Yeah, please, please.
But not too much.

27:43.758 --> 27:46.965
The inspiration
behind the tattoo
I want to get for this,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.551
um, is for my Grandfather.

27:48.586 --> 27:51.965
He passed away
this recent Valentine's Day.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.137
And he was a gambler
and he liked
chocolate covered cherries

27:56.172 --> 28:01.206
so that's the whole, kind of,
inspiration behind
the theme of the tattoo.

28:01.241 --> 28:03.172
I'm gonna make it
look like you could
actually eat it.

28:04.310 --> 28:06.275
I think it's really
special that

28:07.137 --> 28:09.724
she's getting a tattoo about

28:10.482 --> 28:12.000
my Dad and her Pepe.

28:12.034 --> 28:15.172
And, you know,
that it means so much to her

28:16.068 --> 28:18.241
and it means a lot to me.

28:19.413 --> 28:22.241
- So with realism,
size equals information.
- Yeah.

28:22.275 --> 28:25.172
The more realistic we make it,
the bigger it has to be,

28:25.206 --> 28:27.896
or the less things
need to be in it.

28:27.931 --> 28:32.620
So this is actually
really not gonna work
so well for

28:32.655 --> 28:37.172
where you're putting it
and the size
and your unique anatomy.

28:38.620 --> 28:41.551
Size on her tattoo
is definitely gonna be
a little challenging.

28:41.586 --> 28:45.965
Uh, it is a unique situation,
we just have to make sure
that it's done properly.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.379
<i>But still delicate enough</i> <i>
to make sure that she gets</i> <i>
the tattoo that she wants.</i>

28:49.413 --> 28:50.931
But we do it
in a responsible way

28:50.965 --> 28:52.931
where her tattoo
can look good forever.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.413
Well, I think
I got it all buttoned up.

28:55.448 --> 28:57.344
- Okay.
- Ready to do a tattoo?
Come on back.

29:02.724 --> 29:04.103
You're a pretty tough chick,
you know that?

29:04.137 --> 29:05.137
Well, thank you.

29:05.172 --> 29:07.137
People just think
I'm annoying.

29:07.172 --> 29:10.344
I probably don't
feel as confident
as I give off.

29:10.379 --> 29:12.068
Most of the time
I am faking it.

29:12.103 --> 29:15.862
Because I just have so many
insecurities still.

29:15.896 --> 29:18.000
People just
aren't ready for it?
- No, they're not.

29:29.206 --> 29:30.068
All right.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.068
Stage, puppets, crate.

29:33.103 --> 29:33.931
Okay.

29:35.068 --> 29:38.724
Stage, puppets, crate. Cool.

29:38.758 --> 29:40.000
<i>I own</i> <i>
a puppet show business.</i>

29:40.034 --> 29:41.793
And Rylee and I
are getting ready

29:41.827 --> 29:43.758
to do our first puppet show
in two years.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.413
All righty.

29:47.448 --> 29:50.862
<i>The local fire department</i> <i>
is having a craft fair.</i>

29:50.896 --> 29:54.241
<i>And they've allowed us to come</i> <i>
and put on a puppet show.</i>

29:54.275 --> 29:58.896
And, hopefully,
it will attract more people
that might not normally come.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.310
That's what I'm hoping.

30:01.344 --> 30:04.275
- Hold on, I'll check if Blue
still has that shirt in him.
- Yeah.

30:05.103 --> 30:05.931
All right,

30:07.275 --> 30:08.551
Grug's good.

30:08.586 --> 30:09.689
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

30:10.758 --> 30:13.172
My puppet troupe,
they're called the WhoBuddiez

30:13.206 --> 30:15.862
That name came about
from Rylee actually.

30:15.896 --> 30:17.620
When she was a toddler,

30:17.655 --> 30:20.206
she would run around saying,
whobuddie took my sippy cup,

30:20.241 --> 30:22.620
or whobuddie did this,
or whobuddie did that.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.241
And I just really loved
the name.

30:25.275 --> 30:27.620
<i>And when I decided</i> <i>
to build a puppet troupe</i>

30:27.655 --> 30:29.206
<i>I just called them</i> <i>
the WhoBuddiez.</i>

30:29.241 --> 30:32.965
And honestly,
Shauna's the reason why
I started building puppets.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.068
<i>Shauna had cancer as a baby.</i>

30:36.103 --> 30:39.275
<i>And they didn't know</i> <i>
what side effects</i> <i>
she was gonna have.</i>

30:39.310 --> 30:40.689
<i>Or course, her height was one.</i>

30:40.724 --> 30:44.103
<i>But also she had really bad</i> <i>
anger out bursts.</i>

30:44.137 --> 30:47.034
And she'd hit ya, and,
you know, it hurt.

30:47.068 --> 30:48.275
And she'd laugh.

30:48.310 --> 30:50.551
<i>And one day I had</i> <i>
an old puppet that I had</i>

30:50.586 --> 30:51.862
<i>from when I</i> <i>
was in high school,</i>

30:51.896 --> 30:56.241
And we were playing with him
and she hit him,
and he got mad.

30:56.275 --> 30:59.517
That she hit him.
And this was the first time
she ever cared

30:59.551 --> 31:02.000
<i>that somebody got mad at her</i> <i>
for hitting.</i>

31:02.034 --> 31:05.413
I know I gained empathy
via puppets.

31:05.448 --> 31:08.275
And all of the work
he did with it.

31:08.310 --> 31:12.275
<i>I think her interacting</i> <i>
with something</i> <i>
smaller than her,</i>

31:13.551 --> 31:15.275
<i>was beneficial for her.</i>

31:15.310 --> 31:17.413
They're counting on her to

31:18.275 --> 31:19.310
treat them with kindness.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.862
This is Stanley.

31:22.896 --> 31:27.517
He is a polar bear
and he's the stage manager
of the show.

31:28.413 --> 31:30.172
And he and Percy,

31:30.206 --> 31:33.931
Percy is the emcee
of the show,

31:33.965 --> 31:36.137
they're best friends
and polar opposites.

31:37.724 --> 31:39.862
I'm not a part
of the puppet show
or anything.

31:39.896 --> 31:44.241
But I think I have, kind of,
an impact on him
when he makes his puppets.

31:44.275 --> 31:46.965
I mean,
he asks for my opinion.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.586
I want to make it feel
like they have something
that a kid will connect with.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.931
Or be like, oh,
that's a monkey!

31:52.965 --> 31:54.517
Look at the monkey,
kind of, situation.

31:54.551 --> 31:55.862
Cause that's how
I was as a kid.

32:03.793 --> 32:06.724
I'm a little nervous,
cause we did add new songs.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.724
All right, break it down.

32:08.758 --> 32:12.034
We were talking about them,
but I'm like new character,

32:12.068 --> 32:13.724
<i>and I have to remember</i> <i>
certain cues.</i>

32:13.758 --> 32:16.137
<i>And I haven't fully listened</i> <i>
to all the songs.</i>

32:16.172 --> 32:19.551
Yeah, the hard part
is wearing everything.

32:19.586 --> 32:22.724
And making sure
he doesn't over baby powder
the booby trap.

32:24.655 --> 32:25.758
I like big explosions.

32:32.103 --> 32:35.000
Mom,
you can grab a sit.
- Thank you.

32:35.034 --> 32:38.344
Today I'm getting
a tattoo done in remembrance
of my Grandfather.

32:42.965 --> 32:45.551
<i>I looked over</i> <i>
and she looked like she was</i> <i>
10 years old.</i>

32:45.586 --> 32:49.379
And then she was
getting a tattoo so I was
a little bit confused.

32:49.413 --> 32:51.172
<i>Especially seeing her</i> <i>
get a tattoo,</i>

32:51.206 --> 32:53.551
like, because of her situation
it was interesting.

32:54.586 --> 32:56.137
- Are you okay?
I'm okay.

32:56.172 --> 32:57.206
- Are you?
- I'm okay.

32:57.241 --> 32:58.482
- Are you really?
- I'm okay.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.827
Cause you have that,
it's fine voice.

33:03.448 --> 33:07.586
One of the draw backs
of having my Mom there is,
she's very cautious

33:07.620 --> 33:09.896
<i>about the whole</i> <i>
tattoo process.</i>

33:09.931 --> 33:12.793
<i>She would prefer</i> <i>
that I hide all my tattoos.</i>

33:12.827 --> 33:15.000
And I'm just
not that kind of person.

33:15.034 --> 33:18.758
I'm just thinking
that it's going on your body
for the rest of your life,

33:18.793 --> 33:21.551
so, you know,
you wanna make sure
it's perfect.

33:22.241 --> 33:24.103
That's all.

33:24.137 --> 33:26.448
And that, maybe,
you can hide it
if you have to hide it.

33:28.413 --> 33:29.724
- All right, ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:31.241 --> 33:32.448
See, Mom, it just tickles.

33:33.965 --> 33:36.448
Is that what you
call that?
- Yeah.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.724
I don't know,
I've had needles
in my body my entire life.

33:39.103 --> 33:40.931
True.

33:40.965 --> 33:44.137
I know that you were saying
things haven't always, like,
really been easy for you.

33:44.172 --> 33:47.034
I mean, what are some
of the things that you've
been through

33:47.068 --> 33:49.172
that really sick out?

33:49.206 --> 33:54.620
Um, when I was six months old
I was diagnosed
with stage four brain cancer.

33:54.655 --> 33:57.758
- Oh, my God!
- Thankfully,
I do not remember most of it.

33:57.793 --> 34:01.793
I'm sure it was very difficult
for everybody involved.

34:01.827 --> 34:05.517
I think Shauna
has definitely grown
with her confidence.

34:05.551 --> 34:10.482
<i>And tattooing, that world,</i> <i>
they seem accepting of her.</i>

34:10.517 --> 34:13.344
So, it's really...
It's a cool place to be.

34:13.379 --> 34:15.517
You're a pretty
tough chick,
you know that?

34:15.551 --> 34:17.482
Well, thank you.
I didn't know that.

34:20.206 --> 34:21.724
People just think
I'm annoying.

34:24.517 --> 34:26.862
- I don't see that.
- Oh, cause I'm outspoken,
and...

34:28.344 --> 34:31.655
You mean you're
the way that you should be?
- Yeah.

34:31.689 --> 34:34.000
People just aren't
ready for it?
No, they're not.

34:34.034 --> 34:37.793
It's so unfortunate
people sometimes can
base their, uh...

34:37.827 --> 34:39.965
- Their thought of you
before you've even...
Yeah.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.482
...actually said
anything or done anything.

34:42.517 --> 34:45.068
<i>It is nice when you</i> <i>
find someone like Joel,</i>

34:45.103 --> 34:47.793
who wants to ask
those questions
and doesn't wanna be

34:47.827 --> 34:50.344
<i>super, super nosy</i> <i>
of offensive.</i>

34:50.379 --> 34:54.448
And he's just curious
and wants to learn
about it.

34:54.482 --> 34:57.379
And it was nice
talking to him,

34:57.413 --> 34:59.206
because, one,
he understands it,

34:59.241 --> 35:02.896
but, two, I think we
both walked away

35:02.931 --> 35:06.103
with an understanding
about a different human being.

35:06.137 --> 35:09.862
And he had even said,
like, this was my first time
tattooing someone who's short,

35:09.896 --> 35:12.448
so this is a new
experience for me.

35:12.482 --> 35:16.931
And I think it helped him
even though he may
not realize it,

35:16.965 --> 35:20.586
or maybe he does
and it's helped me
even if I don't realize it.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.793
You found a way
to be comfortable
with yourself and...

35:22.827 --> 35:25.344
Yeah,
I mean, it took a little bit,
but...

35:25.379 --> 35:28.448
I have to be
100% honest, like,
I sit in this chair

35:28.482 --> 35:33.517
and I tattoo a lot of people
and everybody has
their own story.

35:33.551 --> 35:35.551
- Everybody comes
from a different walk of life.
Mmm-hmm.

35:35.586 --> 35:40.551
But it's very rare
that I meet somebody like you
that literally owns the stage.

35:40.586 --> 35:43.931
Like, you're a lot like me,
like, you can walk
into a room,

35:43.965 --> 35:45.448
- where nobody knows you...
Mmm-hmm.

35:45.482 --> 35:46.896
...and own the room.
Yeah.

35:46.931 --> 35:50.172
And before you leave,
everybody knows
that you were there.

35:50.206 --> 35:51.862
Yeah.

35:51.896 --> 35:55.000
<i>I probably don't feel</i> <i>
as confident as I give off.</i>

35:55.034 --> 35:56.793
<i>Most of the time,</i> <i>
I am faking it.</i>

35:56.827 --> 36:01.068
And that's what you have
to do, because confidence
is something that you gain.

36:01.103 --> 36:02.827
It's not something
that happens overnight.

36:02.862 --> 36:05.379
It's not something
that's given to you.

36:05.413 --> 36:10.413
So, I think I'm working
on getting my confidence
to the way people see it.

36:10.448 --> 36:14.000
But it's not there yet,
a little bit of it is fake,

36:14.034 --> 36:18.000
because I just have
so many insecurities still.

36:18.034 --> 36:21.586
And until they're all gone
or until I can
overshadow them,

36:21.620 --> 36:23.517
I will not be
at 100% confidence.

36:25.206 --> 36:26.068
Do you like it?

36:28.206 --> 36:29.068
Wanna keep it?

36:29.931 --> 36:31.068
Yeah,
I guess we'll keep it.

36:31.103 --> 36:32.517
Wanna put it on you?

36:36.793 --> 36:40.482
The finished tattoo
was perfect.

36:40.517 --> 36:44.758
I think it came out
very well for, not just me,
not just him,

36:44.793 --> 36:46.793
but for my mom
and for my grandfather.

36:46.827 --> 36:48.896
- Do you like it?
I love it.

36:48.931 --> 36:49.965
Thank you for letting
me do it.

36:53.206 --> 36:55.379
Where's the power cord
for your speaker?

36:55.413 --> 36:56.689
I don't know.

36:56.724 --> 36:58.000
It's not in here
at all.

36:58.034 --> 36:59.965
<i>We realized that we're</i> <i>
missing a power cord,</i>

37:00.000 --> 37:01.827
so I'm gonna have to go home
and get a new one,

37:01.862 --> 37:04.344
<i>which means Rylee's</i> <i>
gonna have to set up</i> <i>
the puppet show by herself.</i>

37:04.827 --> 37:05.862
Fingers crossed.

37:05.896 --> 37:08.034
I never set this up
a day in my life.

37:08.068 --> 37:09.586
Hey, you got this,
puppet girl.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.137
It's hot.

37:25.482 --> 37:28.241
<i>Today, Rylee and I</i> <i>
are putting on our first</i> <i>
puppet show in two years,</i>

37:28.275 --> 37:29.344
at a local craft show.

37:32.275 --> 37:33.275
- Rylee.
- Yes.

37:35.103 --> 37:37.068
Where's the power cord
for your speaker?

37:38.034 --> 37:39.344
I gave it to you.

37:39.379 --> 37:40.965
Where?
- I don't know.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.172
I handed it to you.

37:43.206 --> 37:45.310
The power cord
is not in here at all.

37:45.344 --> 37:46.586
Do we need
to go back home?

37:46.620 --> 37:47.965
Yeah, I'm gonna need to.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.517
- All right, um...
- Um, yeah.

37:52.793 --> 37:54.862
- I messed up.
- I gotta run back home.

37:54.896 --> 37:56.827
<i>We realized that we're</i> <i>
missing a power cord,</i>

37:56.862 --> 37:58.965
so I'm gonna have to go home
and get a new one,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.620
which means Rylee's
gonna have to set up
the puppet show by herself.

38:01.655 --> 38:02.862
All right, I'll be back.

38:03.586 --> 38:04.517
We wish you the best of luck.

38:06.310 --> 38:07.482
Great.

38:07.517 --> 38:10.482
Okay, I never set this up
a day in my life.

38:10.517 --> 38:12.172
Hey, you got this,
puppet girl.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.793
Aw.

38:13.827 --> 38:16.137
He hasn't ever
let me touch this,

38:16.172 --> 38:18.413
let alone attempt
to set this up.

38:18.448 --> 38:19.862
It's gonna be interesting.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.724
Why would you
trust this to me?

38:24.896 --> 38:26.137
Is this the right way?

38:26.172 --> 38:28.758
<i>I don't like being</i> <i>
left alone in general,</i>

38:28.793 --> 38:31.965
so being left alone
and then now I have
to set up the thing

38:32.000 --> 38:34.379
<i>that I've never set up</i> <i>
alone before,</i>

38:34.413 --> 38:36.413
it's like doing a puzzle
without seeing the picture.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.172
I don't know what I'm doing.

38:40.206 --> 38:43.068
Okay, this.
This is how it goes.

38:43.724 --> 38:45.034
Right?

38:45.068 --> 38:47.862
<i>I, uh, quickly regret</i> <i>
not paying attention</i>

38:47.896 --> 38:50.344
and remembering in-depth
on what he does.

38:50.379 --> 38:52.689
Yes! I'm right.

38:52.724 --> 38:54.655
I'm right, I'm right,
I'm right, I'm right.

38:54.689 --> 38:57.034
<i>Oh, it was a victory,</i> <i>
once I got the black tarp on,</i>

38:57.068 --> 38:59.413
'cause at least that makes
the stage setup.

38:59.448 --> 39:02.965
<i>Because, that's a big part,</i> <i>
that, at least, makes it look</i> <i>
like you got a show.</i>

39:04.448 --> 39:05.827
- Hi.
Howdy.

39:07.172 --> 39:09.413
You did very well.
I had no doubt.

39:10.758 --> 39:12.172
<i>Rylee did a really good job.</i>

39:12.206 --> 39:16.000
<i>I had to fix a few things,</i> <i>
but I wasn't</i> <i>
disappointed at all.</i>

39:16.034 --> 39:19.275
I was happy that I could
rely on her to do
what I needed her to do.

39:19.793 --> 39:20.793
There, here we go.

39:22.172 --> 39:24.517
- Hello.

39:24.551 --> 39:25.758
How are you guys today?

39:26.827 --> 39:27.724
Oh.

39:29.448 --> 39:31.482
We've got a lot
of puppets back here,

39:31.517 --> 39:32.862
um, and they wanna
say hi t you.

39:32.896 --> 39:33.793
Are you ready to see them?

39:34.413 --> 39:35.965
Yay!

39:36.000 --> 39:37.379
Well, I guess that's
good enough.

39:37.413 --> 39:39.241
Oh, here we go.

39:45.344 --> 39:49.241
<i>♪ Four little monkeys</i> <i>
jumping on the bed♪</i>

39:49.275 --> 39:53.103
<i>♪ One fell off</i> <i>
and bumped his head♪</i>

39:53.137 --> 39:57.241
<i>♪ Mama called the doctor</i> <i>
and the doctor said♪</i>

39:57.275 --> 39:59.275
<i>♪ No more monkeys</i> <i>

40:00.448 --> 40:04.310
<i>I think I was</i> <i>
never an option</i>

40:04.344 --> 40:06.655
<i>for the puppet show business,</i> <i>
because of my height.</i>

40:06.689 --> 40:10.724
You have to be on a stool
and, like, put your arm
up really high

40:10.758 --> 40:14.379
<i>and with a giant puppet</i> <i>
that's bigger than my arm,</i> <i>
it's not possible.</i>

40:14.413 --> 40:18.172
I got to throw monkeys
in the back,
that was it.

40:18.206 --> 40:22.310
<i>The puppet shows,</i> <i>
seeing the reactions</i> <i>
that the kids have,</i>

40:22.344 --> 40:25.275
as well as the adults,
it makes it all worthwhile.

40:25.310 --> 40:29.275
<i>And, actually, I really enjoy</i> <i>
sharing it with Rylee,</i> <i>
because I think that we</i>

40:29.310 --> 40:32.103
<i>kind of feed off of it</i> <i>
the same way.</i>

40:32.137 --> 40:34.448
<i>You know, we're doing</i> <i>
something that other</i> <i>
people enjoy.</i>

40:34.482 --> 40:37.275
<i>And when you start</i> <i>
getting into it,</i> <i>
that's all you care about,</i>

40:37.310 --> 40:40.482
<i>just, you know,</i> <i>
seeing them dance</i> <i>
and they're having fun.</i>

40:40.517 --> 40:42.310
It's just, it's a rush.

40:42.344 --> 40:44.896
<i>♪ There was a farmer</i> <i>

40:44.931 --> 40:47.206
<i>♪ And Bingo was</i> <i>

40:52.000 --> 40:55.827
I'm not a puppet girl, okay.
I can't see
myself doing it,

40:56.620 --> 40:58.413
when I'm, like, 50.

40:58.448 --> 41:00.793
But it's not bad, it's fun.

41:07.482 --> 41:09.482
- Again, again!

41:11.413 --> 41:14.689
The puppet show
actually went, uh,
really well.

41:14.724 --> 41:16.344
Hey, you wanna see
the puppets?

41:16.379 --> 41:18.034
<i>I always smile</i> <i>
if I see an adult,</i>

41:18.068 --> 41:20.551
<i>like, urging a child to go</i> <i>
up to us afterwards,</i>

41:20.586 --> 41:22.517
<i>'cause then that means</i> <i>
that the kid was</i> <i>
really excited</i>

41:22.551 --> 41:24.793
<i>and the parent was</i> <i>
really excited,</i> <i>
you did a really good job.</i>

41:24.827 --> 41:27.275
So, I'm, like, that's always
the best one.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.689
Hey, listen
to this puppet girl, huh?

41:28.724 --> 41:30.793
- I'm not a puppet girl.

41:30.827 --> 41:32.862
I'm not a puppet girl.

41:32.896 --> 41:34.689
- Puppet girl.
Puppet girl.
- No.

41:34.724 --> 41:35.827
I'm gonna get you a cape.

41:35.862 --> 41:37.827
- I've just done puppet shows.
PG.

41:38.620 --> 41:39.482
You're the puppet girl.

41:43.793 --> 41:44.793
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:44.827 --> 41:46.482
<i>Next time</i> <i>
on</i> I Am Shauna Rae...

41:46.517 --> 41:48.724
You guys looking
for anything specific?

41:48.758 --> 41:51.172
<i>This afternoon we're</i> <i>
going shopping for items</i>

41:51.206 --> 41:52.655
for Tara's bachelorette
weekend.

41:54.620 --> 41:55.965
That pisses me off.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.965
And just go
for a little walk.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.172
I heard they wanted to do
a pole-dancing class.

42:01.206 --> 42:04.689
- I thought, "This is it.
This is where my life ends."

42:04.724 --> 42:06.793
- See, I just can't.
Just ignore it.

42:07.241 --> 42:09.448
I'm short.

42:09.482 --> 42:12.689
I don't think we've ever
done anything close
to pole dancing.

42:18.068 --> 42:20.965
We've never been out,
like, at a club
or a bar together.
