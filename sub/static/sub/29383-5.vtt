("Love Don't Live Here Anymore"
by Rose Royce playing)

00:05.806 --> 00:08.909
* Just a vacancy, babe *

00:08.942 --> 00:12.046
* Love don't live here anymore *

00:18.018 --> 00:19.887
* You abandoned me *

00:19.920 --> 00:21.989
-(vehicle approaching)
-* Love don't... *

00:22.022 --> 00:25.459
* We jam to make you
dance, dance, dance *

00:25.493 --> 00:28.862
* Come on and clap your
hands, hands, hands... *

00:28.896 --> 00:31.031
(other engine turns off,
music stops)

00:31.065 --> 00:32.366
(grunts)

00:45.079 --> 00:47.215
Son of a bitch.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.982
(David speaks indistinctly)

00:49.016 --> 00:50.017
(both laugh)

01:02.196 --> 01:04.198
(siren wailing in distance)

01:05.199 --> 01:07.201
(dog barking in distance)

02:06.660 --> 02:08.796
-(woman gasps)
-(thud)

02:08.829 --> 02:11.832
("Knock On Wood"
by Amii Stewart playing)

02:20.241 --> 02:22.009
Dad?

02:23.010 --> 02:25.446
It's Dee Dee.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.014
Open the door!

02:28.682 --> 02:30.484
I know you in there.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.486
And I know what you doing.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.488
We can talk about this
right now,

02:34.522 --> 02:37.425
or we can talk
about this with Mom later.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.159
* That I got 'cause if I do... *

02:39.193 --> 02:40.828
All right, fine!

02:40.861 --> 02:42.963
You and that skank
better cover up.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.300
-I'm coming in.
-* Surely lose a lot *

02:46.334 --> 02:50.338
-* 'Cause your love is better *
-(gasps)

02:50.371 --> 02:53.173
* Than any love I know... *

02:53.207 --> 02:54.842
(whispers):
What the...

02:54.875 --> 02:56.176
fuck?

02:56.210 --> 02:59.847
* The way you love me
is frightening *

02:59.880 --> 03:02.250
* You better knock, knock *

03:03.317 --> 03:07.755
* On wood, baby *

03:07.788 --> 03:12.025
* Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh *

03:12.059 --> 03:14.895
* Baby *

03:17.631 --> 03:19.667
* Whoo! *

03:19.700 --> 03:21.969
* I'm not superstitious... *

03:22.002 --> 03:25.906
(spasmodic gasping)

03:30.711 --> 03:32.580
(shushing)

03:32.613 --> 03:33.914
I'm not gonna hurt you.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.215
I just need to stop
the bleeding.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.251
(breathing quiets)

03:40.521 --> 03:42.290
(gasping resumes)

03:43.891 --> 03:44.692
(Rita gasps)

03:50.698 --> 03:52.032
Dad?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.034
Dee Dee, what...

03:54.067 --> 03:56.604
what the hell
are you doing here?

03:56.637 --> 03:59.573
Mom said you'd
been disappearing a lot.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.141
I-I thought you were just
running around behind her back.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.576
I didn't... I didn't expe...

04:02.610 --> 04:05.178
You were never supposed to know
this side of me.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.147
No one was.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.183
How long?

04:12.152 --> 04:14.855
My entire life.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.259
It's a pain... I wake up with,

04:19.293 --> 04:20.761
a hunger...

04:20.794 --> 04:22.563
I can't satisfy...

04:22.596 --> 04:25.232
no matter how much I feed it.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.769
I was born with this.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.172
-And I'll die with it.
-(quietly): No, no.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.775
No one is born
with that kind of darkness.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.744
Do you really believe that?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.079
(pants)
I know it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.047
You're not evil.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.015
You raised me.
You loved me.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.751
This is not you.
This is not my daddy.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.955
(whispers):
Please, Daddy.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.590
Please.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.825
(crying):
Please, Daddy.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.295
Please, just put the knife down.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.498
I'm a psychologist.
I can help you.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.133
You can change.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.803
(whispers):
Please, Daddy, please.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.677
(breathes deeply)

05:09.710 --> 05:12.145
I almost believe you, Dee Dee.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.249
-(Rita screaming)
-(grunts)

06:30.023 --> 06:32.059
(music slows, distorts)

06:32.092 --> 06:33.093
(film projector clicking,
then shuts off)

06:39.366 --> 06:41.168
Just because something
seems inconceivable

06:41.201 --> 06:43.336
doesn't mean
that it can't be true.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.673
You were floating.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.641
VOICES (echoing):
Satan. Satan.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.043
I was reborn.
Dead, then raised up

06:50.077 --> 06:53.614
by the Unholy One himself.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.849
He thinks I'm pretty cool,
Dee Dee.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.218
No one's called me that name
in years,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.554
-not since...
-That night. I know.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.189
Satan showed me everything.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.191
Your old man had
a wild appetite.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.994
-What the fuck are you?
-Isn't it obvious?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.929
Evil. Pure.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.600
Uncut. You think it can
be treated like an infection,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.535
but there is no cure,
no pill to take.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.070
The darkness resides
in everyone.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.241
Even you.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.911
N-No, you're wrong.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.014
Look at your little experiment
with Mr. Jingles.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.182
He was locked up.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.919
You released him
into the world.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.387
In a way, he didn't kill anyone.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.389
You did.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.493
You think
you were studying evil?

07:39.527 --> 07:41.061
You are evil.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.830
I was only trying
to do good. I...

07:42.863 --> 07:44.097
Shit.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.934
(laughs softly)

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
Don't take my word for it.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.440
DAVID (distorted):
He's right, Dee Dee.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.077
-(gasps)
-Evil is born,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.412
and you are the fruit
of its seed.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.449
The darkness is inside you.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.387
This isn't real.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.422
You're not real.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.059
You are your father's daughter.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.161
Accept it.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.263
Follow in my footsteps.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.834
There's nothing else you can do.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.837
(wind whooshes)

08:25.072 --> 08:26.840
(shudders)

08:26.874 --> 08:29.009
XAVIER:
It's not big enough.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.644
No one can see it.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.412
We need to build a signal fire.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.181
Big enough for a plane to see!

08:34.214 --> 08:36.516
The cabins, the trees-- we have

08:36.550 --> 08:39.152
-to burn it all!
-We're not burning shit, okay?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.854
We need to find an exit plan.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.022
Yeah, she's right.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.190
Xavier, you need to relax.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.291
Just breathe.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.493
You want me to breathe?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.961
I have breathed the fire

08:47.995 --> 08:50.263
of a thousand white-hot suns!

08:50.297 --> 08:51.832
(crying)

08:55.302 --> 08:58.038
Dude, stop!

08:58.071 --> 08:59.372
Xavier, put that down!

08:59.406 --> 09:01.709
Get back! Get out of the way!

09:01.742 --> 09:03.010
Don't you see?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.277
It all has to burn.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.113
(grunts)

09:06.146 --> 09:10.217
Forgive me, but I had to stop
him before he hurt someone!

09:11.819 --> 09:14.154
Let's get him to a cabin.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.723
MONTANA: We can't stay here.
We have to rally,

09:15.756 --> 09:18.058
go through the woods--
we'll find help eventually.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.827
No. Those woods are a maze,
and in this dark

09:19.860 --> 09:21.494
we'll be walking around
in circles.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.596
And don't forget
about the traps.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.197
She's right.
I mean, Jingles could have

09:24.231 --> 09:25.799
this whole place booby-trapped,
for all we know.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.167
Xavier can't even walk.
We should just

09:27.200 --> 09:28.736
stay here till sunrise.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.470
There is safety in numbers.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.105
And we have a gun.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.341
-Oh, some bad news
on that front.
-(clicks empty)

09:34.374 --> 09:37.177
I used all my bullets trying
to protect Trevor from Jingles.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.012
I wish I could have done more.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.347
But there is another option.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.514
Yesterday I saw
two people camping

09:41.548 --> 09:43.083
on the other side of the lake.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.085
Two of us
could take a boat across.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.286
Maybe they have a car.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.722
-God willing.
-Good idea. Chet'll go with you.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.161
Sure.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.129
I love boats.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.331
You're very brave.
God bless you.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.033
Be careful, you guys.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.042
BROOKE: Do you think
we should wake him up?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.645
I don't think you're supposed
to sleep with a concussion.

10:11.679 --> 10:15.215
I think the less he sees
of this night, the better.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.585
Yeah.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.587
I guess you're right.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.289
Don't you think
it's kind of weird

10:22.322 --> 10:24.992
that Margaret didn't mention
the campers before?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.194
Yeah, well, she's a weird chick.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.829
(chuckles softly)

10:32.065 --> 10:34.001
(chuckles softly)

10:38.739 --> 10:40.640
(Brooke sighs)

10:51.084 --> 10:52.686
Ray.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.122
Ray is out there!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.456
MONTANA:
No, Ray bitched out.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.791
Took off on Trevor's bike

10:57.825 --> 10:59.092
-and left us.
-No, no.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.961
I'm telling you,
he-he's out there.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.229
Maybe he got to the call box

11:02.262 --> 11:03.596
or-or found help!

11:03.630 --> 11:06.599
No. Don't worry.
I promise, I'll be right back.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.402
Yeah, keep that close, okay?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.875
(door opens, closes)

11:14.908 --> 11:17.277
(inhales, exhales sharply)

11:17.310 --> 11:19.612
XAVIER:
Bertie.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.649
Bertie, don't make me do it,
please.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.153
Please, just make me a sandwich.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.055
Oh, Bertie, please.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.656
Please, don't make me do it.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.424
-(gasps)
-Hey. Hey.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.160
You okay?

11:34.661 --> 11:36.964
Yeah.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.732
The fire.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.801
Did it work?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.669
Is someone coming?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.204
No one's coming.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.240
Huh?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.214
Where is everyone?

11:54.247 --> 11:55.816
Chet and Jesus Lady
went to find help.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.350
Brooke went after Ray.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.853
Ray?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.390
(whispers):
Ray.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.227
Ray! Ray, over here!

12:08.128 --> 12:11.231
Hi.
(exhales)

12:11.264 --> 12:12.900
-(panting)
-I knew you wouldn't bail on us.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.234
Did you get help?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.969
Help?

12:16.003 --> 12:17.704
You were going to the call box.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.841
No, no, I've just...
been walking.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.342
I'm sorry,
I'm-I'm kind of foggy.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.911
Okay, well, try to focus.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.079
Montana said you left
on Trevor's motorcycle.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.081
-Then what?
-Um...

12:28.115 --> 12:30.183
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, I did.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.419
Uh, but, uh, I got on a bike,

12:32.452 --> 12:34.487
and I rode out of camp,
but I guess...

12:34.521 --> 12:36.189
I was walking again,

12:36.223 --> 12:38.725
but I guess I've...
I've fallen off?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.928
Did you hit your head
or something?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.263
-(keys jingling)
-Shit.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.933
-That's Jingles.
-Come on, come on, come on.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.908
(owl hoots)

13:00.180 --> 13:02.715
I don't see anything out there.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.151
There's not even a light.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.956
Don't worry, Margaret.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.958
We're gonna find help.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.226
We're gonna get out
of this nightmare.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.429
Do you ever think
about death, Chet?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.999
I thought about it pretty hard

13:19.032 --> 13:21.801
when I was in that pit.
It's terrifying.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.971
The rot and the maggots,

13:24.004 --> 13:25.738
and your insides turn to jelly.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.975
And what if that's just it?
You die,

13:28.008 --> 13:29.843
and then nothing.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.079
Just big, black nothing.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.248
Well, you wouldn't feel that way
if you believed in God.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.951
God judges the righteous
and the wicked,

13:37.985 --> 13:39.619
for when the cold hand of death

13:39.652 --> 13:42.155
squeezes the last breath
from your lungs,

13:42.189 --> 13:44.657
it'll be too late
to ask for forgiveness.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.794
Thanks for the heads-up.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.196
You've lost a lot of blood.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.231
Make peace with your maker.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.133
Confess your sins.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.135
-You won't get another chance.
-Relax.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.004
We're gonna make it out of here.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.006
Why are you so concerned
about my soul?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.408
Because I can see your torment.

14:01.441 --> 14:05.178
I know you're harboring
a terrible secret.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.215
For all your
outward masculinity,

14:08.248 --> 14:12.052
I can always tell the real boys
from the fake ones.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.453
Fuck you, Margaret.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.055
You don't know anything
about me.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.457
I tried.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.126
(chuckles):
God is my witness.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.094
Oh, and you're so pure?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.862
There's nothing
that you have to confess?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.965
Actually, I do.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.138
There's nothing
on the other side.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.207
I just needed to get
each one of you alone with me.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.743
Why?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.113
(screams)

14:40.147 --> 14:42.149
So I can kill you.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.216
(panting)

14:45.485 --> 14:46.719
(rattling)

14:46.753 --> 14:49.056
(muttering):
What are you doing?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.192
What are you doing?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.730
(grunts)

14:57.764 --> 15:00.233
(screaming)

15:03.937 --> 15:05.872
(Margaret screams)

15:05.905 --> 15:06.706
(screams)

15:09.209 --> 15:12.512
No. No! No, no, no,
no, no, no...

15:12.545 --> 15:13.947
(rattling)

15:18.218 --> 15:19.886
(gasping)

15:19.919 --> 15:21.989
(screaming)

15:30.163 --> 15:32.599
(panting)

15:46.013 --> 15:48.048
(both panting)

15:52.419 --> 15:54.287
I think he's gone.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.788
I think we should stay put.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.257
Margaret's gone across
the lake for help.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.958
I don't think it's safe
to move around.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.961
I'm-I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.363
Aren't you scared?

16:05.032 --> 16:07.967
I am. I am, yeah.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.070
Who would have thought,
when this day started,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.272
you and I would end up here,

16:12.305 --> 16:15.242
running from a deranged
psycho killer?

16:15.275 --> 16:20.113
I guess nothing ever turns out
quite how you imagine it.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.915
Even moving to L.A., I, uh...

16:22.949 --> 16:27.854
I had this dumb idea,
this, this dream...

16:27.887 --> 16:29.889
to...

16:33.026 --> 16:34.961
To be somebody?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.329
No.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.331
To be nobody.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.800
And why would you want
to do that?

16:43.070 --> 16:47.107
When I was a kid,
I was a total nerd.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.042
I was always the best
in my class.

16:49.076 --> 16:53.646
And there was this kid
who always came in second,

16:53.680 --> 16:57.484
and he hated coming in second.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.154
One day, he just stopped
talking to me.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.557
Got everybody else in the class
to stop talking to me, too.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.394
I didn't want him to be mad,

17:07.427 --> 17:10.063
so I started pretending
I didn't know things.

17:10.097 --> 17:14.101
I would, you know, get
the answers wrong on purpose.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.568
Mm-hmm.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.341
When he became first,
he asked me to get ice cream.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.811
I said yes.

17:26.879 --> 17:31.784
When he asked me to marry him,
I said yes,

17:31.818 --> 17:34.687
even though...

17:34.721 --> 17:38.558
I wasn't sure
if I really loved him.

17:41.961 --> 17:46.699
I pretended for so long
to be somebody that I wasn't.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.903
Now I don't even know who I am.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.908
(murmurs)

17:57.777 --> 18:00.347
I kind of know what that's like.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.981
You do?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.385
Yeah.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.388
I always wanted to be a doctor.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.823
Like... like Quincy.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.525
(Brooke chuckles)

18:12.559 --> 18:15.995
So I, I worked my ass off
to get into the best schools,

18:16.028 --> 18:18.064
the best fraternities.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.400
I got so wrapped up
in trying to impress

18:20.433 --> 18:23.035
the people I thought could
make my life easier

18:23.069 --> 18:25.572
that I forgot who I was
in the first place.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.746
And in the end,

18:33.780 --> 18:35.782
it cost me.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.186
Cost me a lot.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.887
(Brooke sighs)

18:42.555 --> 18:46.359
So what I'm saying is...

18:46.393 --> 18:48.228
don't feel like
you have to change

18:48.261 --> 18:49.662
to fit into the world.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.402
'Cause you're pretty rad
just the way you are.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.080
Why'd you do that?

19:09.682 --> 19:10.983
I don't know.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.985
(chuckles)
Because I felt like it.

19:13.019 --> 19:17.290
Chances are we're not gonna make
it out of here alive tonight,

19:17.324 --> 19:19.659
and I don't want to die when...

19:19.692 --> 19:22.262
I don't even feel
like I've lived.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.297
So let's do it.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.833
Let's live.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.939
(laughs)

19:32.972 --> 19:34.106
XAVIER:
Highway to Heaven, man.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.611
I still have an audition
on the books.

19:38.645 --> 19:43.015
Possible two-episode arc
as a cheery bellhop.

19:43.049 --> 19:47.920
How's a burn victim ever
supposed to play cheery? Hmm?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.389
MONTANA:
I don't like this.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.023
Brooke should be back by now.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.192
Screw this. You stay here,
I'm gonna go find her.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.864
-Not another step.
-I'm not here to clash.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.699
I only want to help us
get out of here.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.000
Says the bitch
who punched me in the throat.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.869
I suggest you leave now

20:02.902 --> 20:04.637
before I get the urge
to kick more of your ass.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.473
I thought I could help people
all around the world.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.875
I never would have put you
in harm's way otherwise.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.143
The hell are you talking about?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.281
Mr. Jingles.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.384
I released him.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.885
I led him to the camp.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.387
What happened here tonight--
it's...

20:20.420 --> 20:21.921
it's my fault.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.658
You did this to me?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.661
Look at my fucking face!

20:28.695 --> 20:30.663
My Rabbit is parked
in the staff lot.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.999
-If the three of us pull
together, we can survive this.
-No.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.502
It's your fault I'm a monster.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.838
It's your fault I'll never
be on the cover of TV Guide!

20:38.871 --> 20:41.308
It's your fault
my future is in radio!

20:41.341 --> 20:44.176
(Rita whimpering)

20:44.210 --> 20:46.245
You don't want to do this.
Please.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.780
-(groans)
-RITA: No.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.015
Yes, I do.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.384
(screaming)

20:51.418 --> 20:54.053
(whimpering)

20:54.086 --> 20:56.088
(grunts)
Get out of my way!

21:01.294 --> 21:04.030
RAY:
Oh, man.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.299
That was kind of amazing.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.104
Was it good for you?

21:12.138 --> 21:14.106
Mm-hmm.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.943
Yeah, it... was.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.383
I mean, I think so.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.985
I don't really have anything
to compare it to.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.156
You were my first.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.528
Are you serious?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.999
I thought you were engaged.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.803
We, uh, never...

21:45.605 --> 21:46.906
(chuckles)

21:46.939 --> 21:50.343
So... I popped your cherry.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.416
How do you feel?

21:58.951 --> 22:00.987
Thirsty.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.022
(chuckles)

22:17.136 --> 22:18.371
(screams)

22:18.405 --> 22:20.272
RAY:
Brooke?

22:22.141 --> 22:24.677
What is it?
What is it?

22:27.814 --> 22:29.315
Oh, my God.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.685
Is that my head in there?

22:32.719 --> 22:35.187
BROOKE:
Yes. Oh, my God.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.356
-What are you?
-Brooke, please...

22:37.390 --> 22:39.392
No, don't touch me!
Don't...

22:45.698 --> 22:47.700
(grunts)

22:55.074 --> 22:56.676
Holy shit.
Where have you been?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.077
Are you dead, too?
Is everyone

22:58.110 --> 22:59.646
in this whole
fucking place dead?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.347
Slow down.
I'm not dead.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.982
I think I would know
if I was dead.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.051
Well, he didn't.
He was standing

23:05.084 --> 23:07.554
right here, and his head
was right over there.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.321
-What are you talking about?
-Ray.

23:09.355 --> 23:12.659
He's dead. And I know that
doesn't make any sense, but...

23:12.692 --> 23:14.994
I can't breathe.
I feel like

23:15.027 --> 23:16.663
the world is crumbling
out from under me.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.698
I don't know what's real.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.567
I-I don't even trust myself.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.971
Maybe I really am
just losing it.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.540
I wish I never
came to this place.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.742
Don't worry, Brooke.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.011
Ah!

23:32.044 --> 23:34.714
You'll be leaving soon.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.095
MONTANA:
God.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.263
You're always
playing the victim.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.899
People look at you and they see

23:52.932 --> 23:55.434
sweet, innocent Brooke.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.903
Such a "good girl."

23:56.936 --> 23:58.771
But I see what you really are:

23:58.805 --> 24:01.641
a fucking black hole
where light goes to die.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.043
-What?
-And people peg me
as the bad girl?

24:04.076 --> 24:06.112
Why-- 'cause I've got rad hair?

24:06.145 --> 24:09.381
'Cause I act on my feelings?
Where's my sympathy?!

24:09.415 --> 24:11.417
(grunts, groans)

24:15.454 --> 24:17.156
Why are you doing this?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.391
When I saw you that day,

24:19.425 --> 24:22.194
it was like fate.

24:22.228 --> 24:25.364
Out of all the places in
the world you could have been,

24:25.397 --> 24:28.267
there you were,
right in front of me.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.538
And then, out of the sky,

24:31.571 --> 24:34.607
an AK-47 fell in my lap.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.776
It was like
the cosmos telling me

24:36.809 --> 24:38.811
I was right
to hold onto this rage,

24:38.845 --> 24:41.781
because I was waiting for you
to empty out the entire

24:41.814 --> 24:42.982
clip!

24:43.015 --> 24:44.517
Wait.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.952
You sent him?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
Why?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.355
(short chuckle)

24:51.190 --> 24:53.159
Believe me.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.628
I wanted to kill you myself.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.196
But I didn't know
if I had it in me.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.832
I know I seem pretty bitchin',

24:59.866 --> 25:02.134
but I have
moments of doubt, too.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.337
There was only one person in
my life who ever believed in me.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.808
My brother.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.077
And you killed him!

25:11.110 --> 25:13.012
I never killed anybody!

25:13.045 --> 25:14.881
-(growls)
-(screams)

25:14.914 --> 25:17.516
-(gasps, coughs)
-Your maniac fiancé
pulled the trigger,

25:17.550 --> 25:19.018
but you're the reason he's dead.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.486
(coughs, wheezes)

25:20.519 --> 25:23.122
Sam was your brother?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.692
(screams)

25:43.175 --> 25:44.577
(shrieks)

25:44.611 --> 25:47.880
You never should have
brought me here.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.982
I know.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.021
I just wanted to understand him.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.890
Was my father
ever the man I loved?

25:59.659 --> 26:02.862
Or was he...
was he always a killer?

26:05.131 --> 26:06.432
I wasn't.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.569
(keys jingling)

26:15.274 --> 26:18.244
Margaret killed
all those counselors

26:18.277 --> 26:20.279
in the '70s.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.748
(Jingles panting)

26:22.782 --> 26:24.917
Oh.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.119
(Jingles groaning)

26:32.124 --> 26:35.027
She made everyone believe
that I did it.

26:37.563 --> 26:40.199
She made me believe
that I did it.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.404
Outside the war...

26:45.437 --> 26:47.774
I never killed anyone
before tonight.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.980
Then kill me.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.583
It's all my fault.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.618
All of this.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.258
(blade clinks)

27:08.160 --> 27:10.897
I can't live with this darkness.
Just do it.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.503
-No.
-(groans)

27:19.906 --> 27:21.874
There's only one kill left.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.876
(keys jingling)

27:26.412 --> 27:28.981
You--

27:29.015 --> 27:30.883
you don't get off so easy.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.485
You're gonna have to live
with what you've done.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.190
(keys jingling)

27:40.693 --> 27:42.028
(yelling)

27:43.029 --> 27:45.264
(in distance):
Fucking bitch!

27:45.297 --> 27:47.299
(yelling continues)

27:52.238 --> 27:53.672
(growls)

28:05.184 --> 28:06.919
-(yells)
-(shrieks)

28:06.953 --> 28:09.021
(both grunting)

28:26.038 --> 28:28.274
What are you gonna
do with that, Brooke?

28:28.307 --> 28:30.476
Stay away from me.
You're psychotic!

28:30.509 --> 28:32.444
Maybe.
A little.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.546
But that doesn't change
how this is gonna end.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.782
(laughs)

28:45.792 --> 28:47.226
Those belong to you.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.861
You're Mr. Jingles.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.697
I should have
shot you in the head.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.200
I'm gonna rip you apart.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.371
(coughing)

29:10.382 --> 29:11.583
(grunts)

29:11.617 --> 29:13.786
(groaning)

29:13.820 --> 29:16.122
(panting)

29:16.155 --> 29:19.158
I played Robin Hood in '79.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.427
Stagedoor Dinner Theater,
Tustin.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.696
And thanks to Camp Redwood,
I'm back in character.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.070
(groaning)

29:32.604 --> 29:34.406
When you put me in that oven,

29:34.440 --> 29:37.910
you cooked up
your worst nightmare, asshole.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.946
(groaning)

30:07.106 --> 30:08.440
Margaret?

30:08.474 --> 30:11.010
Oh, God, Margaret.
Talk to me.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.079
Margaret?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.314
Are you okay?

30:15.347 --> 30:17.683
Never better, actually.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.136
(grunts)

30:53.485 --> 30:54.820
(echoing laughter)

31:00.359 --> 31:03.862
Do you accept Satan

31:03.896 --> 31:06.065
as your master?

31:25.084 --> 31:28.154
KIDS:
* ...beer on the wall,
98 bottles of beer *

31:28.187 --> 31:30.389
* Take one down,
pass it around *

31:30.422 --> 31:33.859
-* 98 bottles of beer
on the wall *
-(laughing)

31:33.892 --> 31:36.062
* 98 bottles
of beer on the wall *

31:36.095 --> 31:39.531
* 98 bottles of beer *

31:39.565 --> 31:41.700
* Take one down,
pass it around *

31:41.733 --> 31:44.036
* 98 bottles of beer
on the wall... *

31:44.070 --> 31:46.305
Here we are at Camp Redwood.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.274
You all ready for a fun summer?

31:48.307 --> 31:50.076
ALL:
Yeah!

31:52.111 --> 31:54.380
(screaming)

31:54.413 --> 31:57.649
-I want you to know
in your bones.
-(Brooke whimpering)

31:57.683 --> 31:59.018
You did this!

31:59.051 --> 32:02.188
You selfish, evil whore!

32:03.789 --> 32:04.756
(screams)

32:04.790 --> 32:06.125
(grunting)

32:17.336 --> 32:19.205
-(brakes squeak)
-(engine stops)

32:32.151 --> 32:34.153
(screaming)

32:44.130 --> 32:45.764
(helicopter blades whirring)

32:59.778 --> 33:01.847
(grunts)

33:06.018 --> 33:07.553
Oh!

33:07.586 --> 33:08.987
-(crying)
-CHIEF DEPUTY: Oh, my God.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.989
Ma'am?

33:11.023 --> 33:12.158
Are you all right?

33:12.191 --> 33:14.260
Oh, thank God you're here.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.095
Don't worry, ma'am,
you're safe now.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.629
Do you know what happened here?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.665
Do you know who she is?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.333
MARGARET:
Yeah, she's one
of my counselors.

33:21.367 --> 33:22.468
And she went crazy.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.635
She attacked everyone.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.904
She attacked me.
(crying)

33:25.937 --> 33:26.972
Let's get you down...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.507
Please help me.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.327
What am I supposed
to do with this?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.562
There was no body next to it?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.331
Found it in the refrigerator.
I heard there was

33:52.364 --> 33:54.032
a motorcycle wreck
by the entrance.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.468
-That body had no head.
-Bag it separately.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.204
We'll deal with who it
belongs to at the morgue.

34:17.256 --> 34:19.958
Sir, do you need help?

34:19.991 --> 34:22.128
Uh, yeah.
I de-I definitely do.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.562
Are you hurt?

34:23.595 --> 34:25.564
Yeah. Real bad.

34:25.597 --> 34:28.700
Uh, I just don't know
how or where, exactly.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.237
Okay, have a seat.
I'm just gonna take some vitals.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.174
Look, I have to
get out of here, okay?

34:35.207 --> 34:37.042
I can't stay in this place
another second.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.077
-I have to get out right now.
-Just take it easy.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.847
It was all bad.
All that blood and death.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.014
This camp is fucked up.

34:43.048 --> 34:45.251
I just want to go home.
Please.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.725
Let's get him to the hospital.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.735
Sir, we're gonna take
good care of you.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.604
-Just relax.
-(engine starts)

35:05.637 --> 35:06.972
You're safe now.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.012
(chuckles)

35:28.760 --> 35:30.762
(siren wailing)

36:03.262 --> 36:05.597
I just wanted to go home.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.333
JONAS:
This is home.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.047
Hey!

36:27.653 --> 36:30.456
Son of a bitch.

36:35.661 --> 36:36.695
Ma'am?

36:36.728 --> 36:38.530
You okay?

36:42.901 --> 36:43.969
Tell me what's wrong.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.838
I'm fucking dead, that's what.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.140
(yells)

36:49.174 --> 36:51.109
Whoa! Easy.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.511
You think if I killed you
right now

36:52.544 --> 36:53.879
they'd give me the chair?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.214
Most definitely.

36:56.248 --> 36:57.749
-(grunting)
-(yelling)

37:01.320 --> 37:03.054
Agree to disagree.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.156
What the hell, Montana?

37:05.190 --> 37:07.025
(with accent):
There is no Montana.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.860
Only Zuul.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.132
(normal voice):
It's a joke, lighten up.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.168
You guys are doing this
purgatory thing all wrong.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.471
We can be gods here.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.739
(laughs)

37:21.940 --> 37:23.975
Ugh, you guys
are fucking boring.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.577
Let's go.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.214
Come on.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.485
* Wow! *

37:33.519 --> 37:36.087
* You know we gonna ride *

37:36.121 --> 37:39.090
* On a blue highway *

37:39.124 --> 37:42.494
* Walk with electro glide *

37:42.528 --> 37:45.731
* On a blue highway *

37:45.764 --> 37:47.733
* Wave below to Christ *

37:47.766 --> 37:51.169
* On my highway *

37:51.202 --> 37:53.004
* Yes, I almost died *

37:53.038 --> 37:55.607
-Hey.
-* On a blue highway... *

37:58.209 --> 37:59.578
Seat belt.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.580
Seat belt?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.382
(laughs)

38:04.816 --> 38:08.420
(both laughing)
