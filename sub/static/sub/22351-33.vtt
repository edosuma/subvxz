00:01.990 --> 00:05.989
Previously on big brother.

00:05.990 --> 00:09.989
With Meg and Julia on the
block, Julie made a shocking

00:09.990 --> 00:10.990
announcement.

00:10.991 --> 00:13.989
Julie: Its's time for
another double eviction.

00:13.990 --> 00:14.990
Wow!

00:14.991 --> 00:18.289
And grandma became the
first casualty of the night.

00:18.290 --> 00:22.989
Julie: By a vote of 4-1,
Meg, you are evicted from

00:22.990 --> 00:25.989
the Big Brother house.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.989
The house guests hit the
road on a quest for power.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.989
And Liz drove away with her
third hoh.

00:33.990 --> 00:33.991
Season.

00:33.991 --> 00:37.989
Julie: Liz, you are the
new head of household.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.829
With her target leer.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.989
Put me up there, I understand.

00:41.990 --> 00:42.410
Okay.

00:42.411 --> 00:44.989
The twins nominations
came as no surprise.

00:44.990 --> 00:47.989
I'm sorry James and John,
please take a seat.

00:47.990 --> 00:51.989
In a critical veto
competition for James, he

00:51.990 --> 00:55.119
was no match for the twins.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.989
Julie: A big
congratulations goes to

00:56.990 --> 00:59.989
Julia, you have won the
power of veto.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.989
At the veto meeting,.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.989
It would be really
awesome if you used the veto

01:03.990 --> 01:05.989
on me and that's it.

01:05.990 --> 01:06.990
Use it.

01:06.991 --> 01:09.989
Julia honored her
sister's nominations.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.989
I'm to the going to use
the power of veto.

01:11.990 --> 01:15.989
And the country boy's
goose was officially cooked.

01:15.990 --> 01:19.989
Julie: By a vote of 4-0,
James, you are evicted from

01:19.990 --> 01:23.989
the Big Brother house.

01:23.990 --> 01:25.989
With only six house
guests remaining, it's time

01:25.990 --> 01:27.989
to go to war.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.989
Tonight a new head of
household will be crowned.

01:32.990 --> 01:36.989
Will Austin keep the power
or will Steve, John and

01:36.990 --> 01:38.989
Vanessa's secret alliance
emerge from the shadows and

01:38.990 --> 01:39.990
strike first.

01:39.991 --> 01:47.991
Find out right now on "big
brother"

01:50.990 --> 01:55.990
captioning funded by CBS
>> you know are you

02:28.990 --> 02:29.990
absolutely not my target.

02:29.991 --> 02:33.989
You knew who my target was was.

02:33.990 --> 02:36.539
Tonight
remight... reminded me of a

02:36.540 --> 02:37.989
category five hurricane.

02:37.990 --> 02:38.990
I was so scared.

02:38.991 --> 02:39.999
Anything could have happened.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.989
My sister was just on the
block and I knew that I had

02:43.990 --> 02:49.989
to win this hoh for my
sister and I.

02:49.990 --> 02:50.990
> Wow.

02:50.991 --> 02:53.829
Wow, wow, wow.

02:53.830 --> 02:54.989
What just happened?

02:54.990 --> 02:55.990
What just happened?

02:55.991 --> 02:57.989
My head is totally
spinment I don't even know

02:57.990 --> 03:03.289
what just happened, but I
couldn't have planned any

03:03.290 --> 03:06.119
betterment James my number
one target left and the only

03:06.120 --> 03:08.989
person I wasn't working with,
the only person who was

03:08.990 --> 03:11.829
targeting me goes home and I
can breathe easy going into

03:11.830 --> 03:14.989
final six and yeah, I like
my situation...

03:14.990 --> 03:18.989
I feel like I'm a... oh my
God.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.539
It's been a very busy day.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.829
I did not see this double
eviction coming.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.989
It was a total blindside but
at the same time it great

03:25.990 --> 03:27.989
news because now James is
out the door.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.989
James was the only person
left in the house I didn't

03:29.990 --> 03:33.289
have some type of alliance
with and it's such a relief

03:33.290 --> 03:34.989
to see him go.

03:34.990 --> 03:35.990
So final six.

03:35.991 --> 03:39.989
It is 3 versus 3, Julia
and Liz, thank you for

03:39.990 --> 03:43.119
evicting someone that was
aligned with no one and

03:43.120 --> 03:46.539
decide to keep me who is
aligned with Vanessa and

03:46.540 --> 03:46.990
Steve.

03:46.991 --> 03:54.991
It's time for a bloodbath
right now.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.829
Thank you.

03:59.830 --> 04:00.410
Why?

04:00.411 --> 04:03.699
You had to do it.

04:03.700 --> 04:03.990
Yeah.

04:03.991 --> 04:08.989
You did great.

04:08.990 --> 04:10.999
Johnnie mack knew he was
going have to go up no

04:11.000 --> 04:15.949
matter what.

04:15.950 --> 04:21.989
It is per fej... perfect.

04:21.990 --> 04:26.989
I'm just glad I'm still here.

04:26.990 --> 04:32.409
You get to sleep in the
same bed.

04:32.410 --> 04:37.989
I'll try to get us upstairs.

04:37.990 --> 04:38.990
We're free now.

04:38.991 --> 04:40.989
Like what do I do if I win.

04:40.990 --> 04:41.990
Without do I put up?

04:41.991 --> 04:46.989
Obviously not have
Johnnie mack to put up.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.989
I don't know who to put next
to him am because if he

04:49.990 --> 04:52.409
comes down, it is a scary
week for me.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.999
Why is it scary for you.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.989
Because I might have to
put up Julia or something as

04:56.990 --> 04:57.990
a pawn.

04:57.991 --> 04:59.989
I don't want to put you up.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.989
Thank you.

05:01.990 --> 05:06.989
And just the situations
are coming.

05:06.990 --> 05:07.990
Decisions are coming.

05:07.991 --> 05:09.990
Yes, they are.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.989
Tlses's six people left
in the game and I'm aligned

05:20.990 --> 05:21.700
with five of them.

05:21.701 --> 05:25.539
That manies if I win hoh I'm
going to have to sput

05:25.540 --> 05:27.989
someone up from my own
alliance and get blood on my

05:27.990 --> 05:28.410
hands.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.989
I don't know if it's in my
own interest to win this

05:30.990 --> 05:30.991
one.

05:30.991 --> 05:38.989
What does do they do if
they win hoh?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.539
Did I care you?

05:40.540 --> 05:42.989
No, I'm more thinking
about myself.

05:42.990 --> 05:45.989
How do I survive.

05:45.990 --> 05:48.289
Austin winning hoh this
we can is not desirable for

05:48.290 --> 05:48.990
me.

05:48.991 --> 05:51.289
He's never going to take a
shot at Liz or sqlulia.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.989
The best case is either
Steve or Johnnie mack wins

05:53.990 --> 05:54.290
this week.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.999
It's down to me or
johniest mack.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.989
What dow mean.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.989
Unless it is a worst-case
scenario.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.999
Generallie mack will vote
for me.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.989
I can make it happen.

06:08.990 --> 06:16.990
That's what I do.

06:28.990 --> 06:31.989
I mean he's going to have to.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.949
There's no other option.

06:33.950 --> 06:34.989
We did it.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.539
We have a good shot.

06:36.540 --> 06:36.990
Yeah.

06:36.991 --> 06:38.989
A good shot.

06:38.990 --> 06:43.989
Dow feel blessed right now?

06:43.990 --> 06:49.989
A blessed feeling.

06:49.990 --> 06:57.989
Okay, sounds good.

06:57.990 --> 06:59.989
It's worked out well.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.409
You an I, dude.

07:02.410 --> 07:04.989
If we win hoh, why?

07:04.990 --> 07:07.989
It's going to be tough.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.989
Let's do it.

07:09.990 --> 07:14.989
We didn't come here to lose.

07:14.990 --> 07:15.990
I know.

07:15.991 --> 07:17.989
Right?

07:17.990 --> 07:20.409
Im's sitting at the
intersection of two

07:20.410 --> 07:20.990
alliances.

07:20.991 --> 07:23.699
Now is the time to make this
decision and take a shot at

07:23.700 --> 07:24.989
Austin and the twins.

07:24.990 --> 07:32.989
We can't risk not doing
the three of them.

07:32.990 --> 07:33.990
We have to throw this.

07:33.991 --> 07:39.989
Are you considering it.

07:39.990 --> 07:47.990
I know.

07:52.990 --> 07:57.989
Me and John are in a
really, really good spot in

07:57.990 --> 07:58.990
this stage.

07:58.991 --> 08:05.989
You are really screwed.

08:05.990 --> 08:11.989
Idiots, you just made the
biggest mistake in the game.

08:11.990 --> 08:19.990
And twins...
>> hey, everybody, it's time

08:23.990 --> 08:26.989
for the head of household
competition.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.989
Head out to the backyard!

08:28.990 --> 08:31.989
Whooo!

08:31.990 --> 08:39.409
Oh, those are disgusting!

08:39.410 --> 08:39.990
Yeah!

08:39.991 --> 08:42.989
I walk outside to the
backyard and this is really

08:42.990 --> 08:46.989
cool baseball stadium with a
baseball diamond and I can't

08:46.990 --> 08:47.120
play.

08:47.121 --> 08:51.829
So I'm really putting my
money on Austin, Julia,

08:51.830 --> 08:53.989
Vanessa or Steve to hit this
one out of the park because

08:53.990 --> 08:59.989
that means we're in the
final five.

08:59.990 --> 09:00.990
Well,.

09:00.991 --> 09:03.989
House guest, the power is
up for grabs, as the

09:03.990 --> 09:06.989
outgoing head of household
I'm not eligible to compete.

09:06.990 --> 09:10.989
In baseball having a sharp
eye and quick reaction time

09:10.990 --> 09:12.989
can help you win and the
same can be said about

09:12.990 --> 09:16.989
tonight's head of household
competition.

09:16.990 --> 09:17.990
Here's how it works.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.409
In each round players will
be shown a starting line-up

09:21.410 --> 09:24.989
of bb 17 house guests
trading cards.

09:24.990 --> 09:25.990
At a rapid pace.

09:25.991 --> 09:28.989
Gradually the pace slows
down making it easier to see

09:28.990 --> 09:30.949
who it featured.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.989
When you think you know
which house guest playing

09:32.990 --> 09:36.989
card is not pictured in the
line-up, arrange your cube

09:36.990 --> 09:39.989
pz El to create the face of
the missing player.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.989
Once you have solve the
puzzle hit the button.

09:42.990 --> 09:44.989
If your light box turns
green are you correct and

09:44.990 --> 09:46.699
will advance to the next rounds.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.989
If it turns red, you are
incorrect but may keep

09:49.990 --> 09:50.990
playing and try again.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.989
In each round, the last
player to correctly solve

09:53.990 --> 09:55.989
their puzzle will be eliminated.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.989
The last player standing
will be the new head of

09:58.990 --> 09:59.990
household.

09:59.991 --> 10:03.989
Step up to the plate because
it's time to play starting

10:03.990 --> 10:04.990
line-up.

10:04.990 --> 10:04.991
Yeah!

10:04.991 --> 10:10.989
(Applause)
>> Someone from the scamper

10:10.990 --> 10:14.289
squad has got to win this
hoh because we got to send

10:14.290 --> 10:15.989
Johnnie mack back out the door.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.409
He is like a zombie.

10:17.410 --> 10:20.989
He rolls back from the dead
and now it's time for you to

10:20.990 --> 10:22.989
go again, John.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.989
Being aligned with five
of the six people left in

10:24.990 --> 10:27.989
the house makes it seem like
it would be a good idea to

10:27.990 --> 10:29.989
throw the hoh competition.

10:29.990 --> 10:33.949
But ultimately it's just way
too risky.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.989
At this stage of the game
there are only six players

10:35.990 --> 10:36.990
left.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.989
And it is absolutely
essential that Austin and

10:38.990 --> 10:40.989
the twins get broken up.

10:40.990 --> 10:43.989
For speed Johnnie mack and I
we can't go into final five

10:43.990 --> 10:46.989
and allow them to have a 3-2
majority over us in the

10:46.990 --> 10:47.990
house.

10:47.991 --> 10:49.989
Austin and the twins have
been kind of running the

10:49.990 --> 10:50.990
house.

10:50.991 --> 10:52.989
It's about time someone puts
a stop to their train.

10:52.990 --> 10:57.989
If Vanessa, Steve or I don't
win this hoh, one of us is

10:57.990 --> 10:58.990
going out the door.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.989
Time is now, everyone get on
your battle suits because

11:01.990 --> 11:05.829
it's time, it's time for
everyone to go to war.

11:05.830 --> 11:05.990
Free-for-all.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.990
Whooo!

11:15.990 --> 11:18.989
House guest, the power is
up for grabs.

11:18.990 --> 11:26.990
Let's take a look at the
first inning.

11:28.990 --> 11:32.989
In each round the screen
starts flashing bb 17 house

11:32.990 --> 11:34.989
guest trading cards.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.829
You have to figure out which
house guest isn't shown and

11:37.830 --> 11:40.989
then go to your puzzle block
and arrange it to show the

11:40.990 --> 11:46.989
face of the missing house guest.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.989
Once a puzz sell complete
we run back to our button

11:49.990 --> 11:52.989
and buzz in.

11:52.990 --> 11:56.289
Each round the last person
to buzz in correctly will be

11:56.290 --> 11:56.990
eliminated.

11:56.991 --> 12:01.989
The last person standing
will be the new hoh.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.989
I realize oh my God, Jason
is not up there.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.289
We feed to build Jason.

12:07.290 --> 12:09.989
I start naming the house
guests in order that they

12:09.990 --> 12:10.990
were evicted.

12:10.991 --> 12:15.989
I find jas, davon and Jeff,
but jas is missing.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.409
He is the house guest I have
to find.

12:17.410 --> 12:19.949
Puzzles have treated me
pretty well so hopefully I

12:19.950 --> 12:22.289
can figure out which side is
the right side and arrange

12:22.290 --> 12:24.119
them together in the fastest
time.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.989
The best strategy was to
look down at the six sided

12:26.990 --> 12:29.989
cube and figure out which
six faces will be

12:29.990 --> 12:33.989
represented on each side of
the cube so I knew which six

12:33.990 --> 12:37.989
house guests to scan the
screen for.

12:37.990 --> 12:45.990
Right away I realized
it's Jason, my lanta.

12:46.290 --> 12:51.949
Steve's first to ring in
with the correct answer.

12:51.950 --> 12:55.989
Julia second to ring in
with the correct answer.

12:55.990 --> 13:03.990
Down to John, Vanessa and
Austin.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.989
John is third to ring in
with the correct answer.

13:08.990 --> 13:13.989
Now it's down to Austin and
Vanessa.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.989
I'm trying to put Jason's
face together and while I

13:15.990 --> 13:18.989
have like 90% of his face
looking good, I can't seem

13:18.990 --> 13:21.989
to jam together his hand
with his pink shirt,

13:21.990 --> 13:29.989
something's not right.

13:29.990 --> 13:34.989
And then I realize, oh,
duh, I'm missing three

13:34.990 --> 13:36.989
pieces.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.989
Austin rings in with the
right answer.

13:39.990 --> 13:43.829
I'm sorry, Vanessa, you
were unable to complete your

13:43.830 --> 13:43.990
pz El.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.990
You were out.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.990
All right, that sucks.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.989
It stinks but I'm the
first one out and now it's

13:48.990 --> 13:51.989
up to Steve and John to win
this hoh to break up Austin

13:51.990 --> 13:53.989
and the twins this week.

13:53.990 --> 14:01.990
All right, time to begin
the second inning.

14:08.990 --> 14:14.119
The names are flying by
and right away I notice that

14:14.120 --> 14:14.990
davon's name smition.

14:14.991 --> 14:17.989
I feel I'm in good shape, I
feel like I should be able

14:17.990 --> 14:25.990
to get this one pretty quickly.

14:28.700 --> 14:36.700
John is first to ring in
with the correct answer.

14:37.990 --> 14:40.949
I'm having a really hard
time on the puzzle because

14:40.950 --> 14:42.989
pieces keep sliding
everywhere on the tilted

14:42.990 --> 14:44.989
surface, instead I will work
on the flat table hine me so

14:44.990 --> 14:51.989
I with put pieces exactly
where I want them.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.989
Julia is second to ring in
with the right answer.

14:54.990 --> 14:59.989
Its he down to Steve and Austin.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.989
Austin can't win this
round because if he does my

15:01.990 --> 15:09.990
plan to make a dent could go
completely down the tube.

15:14.990 --> 15:17.989
Steve is also correct.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.989
I'm sorry, Austin, you were
unable to complete your

15:20.990 --> 15:21.990
puzzle.

15:21.990 --> 15:22.990
You're out of the game.

15:22.990 --> 15:23.990
Oh my God.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.989
Steve buzzes in before me
and I'm eliminated.

15:26.990 --> 15:30.989
I look over to Liz and I
feel absolutely heartbroken.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.539
I know she was counting on
me and now all that the

15:33.540 --> 15:36.989
twins and I have left is Julia.

15:36.990 --> 15:40.989
It's down to Steve, John
and Julia.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.989
I'm on the edge of my
baseball bench.

15:43.990 --> 15:45.989
I do not want Johnnie mack
to win.

15:45.990 --> 15:47.989
I feel like he is definitely
coming after us.

15:47.990 --> 15:52.989
And I desperately want Julia
or Steve to win this so

15:52.990 --> 15:52.991
badly.

15:52.991 --> 16:00.991
The third inning begins now.

16:09.990 --> 16:12.989
So when the cards are
flying by I know that Jeff

16:12.990 --> 16:18.989
is missing, so I start
assembling Jeff right away.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.989
Now it's two on one, me
and John versus Julia.

16:21.990 --> 16:25.989
If me and John can beat out
Julia this round we are in a

16:25.990 --> 16:33.990
really good place for this week

16:42.990 --> 16:44.989
.

16:44.990 --> 16:46.989
Steve is the first one to
ring in correct.

16:46.990 --> 16:54.990
It's down to John and Julia.

16:58.990 --> 17:02.119
John is correct, I'm
sorry, Julia, you're out.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.989
It was Jeff, right?

17:03.990 --> 17:06.989
Jeff.

17:06.989 --> 17:08.119
I feel like I've just struck
out.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.989
I'm joining the benchwarmers
and I realize it's Steve

17:12.990 --> 17:12.991
versus John.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.989
Johnnie mack cannot win this
head of household

17:15.990 --> 17:15.991
competition.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.989
Liz jut put him up as a pawn
during the double eviction

17:18.990 --> 17:21.989
and he is going to
definitely put her up, so

17:21.990 --> 17:23.989
I'm so nervous.

17:23.990 --> 17:26.989
Good luck, boys.

17:26.990 --> 17:28.989
Julia goes out and I
never act excited ever

17:28.990 --> 17:31.289
because in poker you are
taught not to celebrate.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.119
I'm actually really, really
happy.

17:33.120 --> 17:33.990
Whooo.

17:33.991 --> 17:36.989
It's down to the last
inning, John versus Steve.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.989
Whoever wins this will be
the new head of household.

17:39.990 --> 17:41.989
Good luck, John.

17:41.990 --> 17:42.990
Good luck, Steve.

17:42.991 --> 17:45.989
The final round is down
to me and John but still I

17:45.990 --> 17:47.989
want to win this hoh comp
for me.

17:47.990 --> 17:50.989
You can't win this game
without getting hohs and

17:50.990 --> 17:58.990
this is my chance to start
that run.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.989
I'm looking at the faces
and the one that is missing

18:04.990 --> 18:07.989
is jas, I'm putting together
the center of his face, the

18:07.990 --> 18:09.989
eyes, mouth, nose and chin
and then I can figure out

18:09.990 --> 18:13.989
all the hair around that.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.989
I'm rating for Steve at
this point because I have no

18:15.990 --> 18:18.699
idea what Johnnie mack's
head is at.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.989
He's really capable of anything.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.989
And I put him up on the
block as a pawn twice.

18:22.990 --> 18:26.989
We already evicted the guy once.

18:26.990 --> 18:34.990
So I don't trust him.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.989
So it's down to me and Steve.

18:37.990 --> 18:40.999
Best-case scenario, we're
going to send a big target

18:41.000 --> 18:42.409
home this week.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.989
Now it's really down to who
should win this hoh.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.989
What is better for our
long-term game?

18:47.990 --> 18:50.119
I need to be playing hoh
next week.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.989
Steve, you need to take down
this win.

18:53.990 --> 19:01.989
Congratulations, buddy, I'll
play next week.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.989
Steve, you are the new
head of household.

19:04.990 --> 19:05.990
Steve!

19:05.991 --> 19:07.989
Whooo!

19:07.990 --> 19:08.990
Good job.

19:08.990 --> 19:09.830
Thank you.

19:09.831 --> 19:10.949
You earned it.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.829
I'm the new head of
household this week.

19:12.830 --> 19:14.989
This feels absolutely
incredible there are only

19:14.990 --> 19:17.989
six people left in this game.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.999
Everyone needs to do what
best for their game.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.989
Right now Austin was the
biggest threat and it's time

19:23.990 --> 19:24.990
for me to go after them.

19:24.991 --> 19:28.989
It's time to make big moves.

19:28.990 --> 19:29.990
Congratulations.

19:29.991 --> 19:32.989
Steve wins hoh and this
is my best-case scenario.

19:32.990 --> 19:35.989
Because I know he will go
after Austin and the twins.

19:35.990 --> 19:39.949
I should be able to sit back,
let Steve get blood on his

19:39.950 --> 19:42.989
hands and watch the fireworks.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.989
Steve wins head of household.

19:44.990 --> 19:44.991
I'm so happy.

19:44.991 --> 19:47.989
I feel like I can trust him
100%.

19:47.990 --> 19:50.539
And knowing that I'm safe is
amazing.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.989
Thank you.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.989
I definitely feel close
to Steve and I feel like he

19:53.990 --> 19:56.539
wants to stay loyal to the
scamper squad.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.989
But I know that he's also a
numbers guy.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.989
And I'm worried that he
might not think keeping me

20:01.990 --> 20:04.989
and the twins together is
best for his game going

20:04.990 --> 20:06.990
forward

20:16.990 --> 20:19.989
so the day, the number
one thing I want is a

20:19.990 --> 20:21.989
picture of Harrison.

20:21.990 --> 20:22.999
You'll get it.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.989
Now that Steve has hoh,
if everything goes as

20:25.990 --> 20:27.989
planned he will go after
Austin and the twins and I

20:27.990 --> 20:31.989
should be sitting pretty
between two duos that are

20:31.990 --> 20:36.989
likely targeting each other,
not me.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.989
I could kiss you.

20:38.990 --> 20:41.989
I really could.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.989
Win next week, Vanessa.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.989
The reason I need to win
this because I won't be able

20:45.990 --> 20:48.289
to win whatever it is next week.

20:48.290 --> 20:56.290
The comps change.

21:01.990 --> 21:08.989
What is Steve going to do?

21:08.990 --> 21:09.990
He is pilting upjohn?

21:09.991 --> 21:10.999
I don't think so.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.829
I would be shocked.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.949
Are you kidding me.

21:14.950 --> 21:16.989
You don't think John is
going to be one of the

21:16.990 --> 21:17.830
nominations?

21:17.830 --> 21:18.830
I have no idea.

21:18.831 --> 21:21.989
I just would be shocked.

21:21.990 --> 21:29.989
It's his buddy.

21:29.990 --> 21:32.989
Steve better not put up
Liz and I on the block

21:32.990 --> 21:34.999
together because the one
twin that stays is coming

21:35.000 --> 21:37.949
after him with a vengence.

21:37.950 --> 21:43.989
Lord help any mister that
comes between me and my

21:43.990 --> 21:43.991
sister.

21:43.991 --> 21:50.989
I'm scared.

21:50.990 --> 21:55.539
I just want to know a,
I'm hoping to help you with

21:55.540 --> 21:55.990
anything you need.

21:55.990 --> 21:56.990
Okay.

21:56.991 --> 21:58.989
So just tell me if you
need anything for me.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.989
If you want to honor the
scamper squad until final

22:01.990 --> 22:05.119
five, I will do whatever I need.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.989
My thing is I'm the
bottom of the totem pole in

22:08.990 --> 22:10.989
the scamper squad.

22:10.990 --> 22:11.990
Not with me.

22:11.991 --> 22:15.989
There are certain things
I can't do you know.

22:15.990 --> 22:17.989
In position with the girls...

22:17.990 --> 22:20.829
when steves tells me
feels like he's the fifth

22:20.830 --> 22:23.989
man in the totem pole in the
scarper... scamper squad

22:23.990 --> 22:26.989
alliance I realize his hoh
reign is not going to secure

22:26.990 --> 22:27.540
us into the top five.

22:27.541 --> 22:30.989
No he's going to take a shot
at us and it's going to most

22:30.990 --> 22:32.989
likely be myself or the twins.

22:32.990 --> 22:34.989
I understand if you have
to do what you have to do.

22:34.990 --> 22:38.989
If you do it, I will try my
best to make the other one

22:38.990 --> 22:40.989
stay, not coming after you.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.699
Because they listen to me.

22:42.700 --> 22:43.120
And they trust me.

22:43.121 --> 22:46.949
I got to find a way to
save myself and the twins

22:46.950 --> 22:46.990
every week.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.989
But we're at the point in
the game where I have to

22:49.990 --> 22:50.990
remember that I'm an
individual first.

22:50.991 --> 22:52.989
I came in this house alone.

22:52.990 --> 22:55.949
I can't save us all all the
time.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.989
Hopefully I can keep at
least Liz safe but that

22:57.990 --> 22:59.989
means we might lose Julia
this week.

22:59.990 --> 23:02.989
I'm giving you my word
right now next week you will

23:02.990 --> 23:03.990
not go on the block.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.989
Sorry, I have to put the
other people up, are you the

23:06.990 --> 23:08.829
hoh because I made the
promise with you.

23:08.830 --> 23:09.830
You will do that.

23:09.830 --> 23:10.120
I will do that.

23:10.121 --> 23:14.289
I will shake on it right now,
if you want.

23:14.290 --> 23:16.989
That's wah told me when
you said you weren't putting

23:16.990 --> 23:17.990
Johnnie an me next to each
other.

23:17.991 --> 23:20.989
Can you tell me it's not
going to be me next to John.

23:20.990 --> 23:21.990
Yes.

23:21.991 --> 23:24.989
Okay, thank you.

23:24.990 --> 23:30.989
I know, but it was such a
cluster... in my mind and I

23:30.990 --> 23:33.989
all these words, I didn't
have any of that.

23:33.990 --> 23:34.990
And I didn't shake on it.

23:34.991 --> 23:37.989
So you're telling me, I
want to make sure I

23:37.990 --> 23:38.540
completely understand.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.699
Next week are you not
going up at all.

23:40.700 --> 23:41.410
No matter what.

23:41.411 --> 23:43.119
I don't go up this week
and I will support what you

23:43.120 --> 23:43.990
do.

23:43.991 --> 23:48.539
So if I do the move, you
think you could keep the

23:48.540 --> 23:50.989
other one from going after
me next week.

23:50.990 --> 23:54.989
I'm the only one that could.

23:54.990 --> 23:57.989
And that's got to be
between you and me.

23:57.990 --> 23:59.989
This conversation cannot
leave this room.

23:59.990 --> 24:02.119
Austin has been throwing
me a bunch of promises, a

24:02.120 --> 24:04.989
bunch of deals an they're
too good to be true.

24:04.990 --> 24:07.989
Austin I done believe you're
going to throw away your

24:07.990 --> 24:10.119
game for me next week just
to keep you safe this week.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.989
That doesn't make sense.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.989
These promises can't be true
and you know it.

24:13.990 --> 24:15.989
I didn't want this to
happen but I get it.

24:15.990 --> 24:16.830
You know.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.119
And that's the thing that we
need to establish is that I

24:19.120 --> 24:20.949
get these things.

24:20.950 --> 24:22.999
Okay, thank you for
talking to me.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.989
We can talk tomorrow.

24:24.990 --> 24:30.989
Okay.

24:30.990 --> 24:32.989
I'm nervous for youness.

24:32.990 --> 24:33.990
For me, why?

24:33.991 --> 24:41.989
I either put upjohn and
Julia or you and Julia.

24:41.990 --> 24:42.990
What?

24:42.991 --> 24:44.289
I think.

24:44.290 --> 24:45.989
Why me.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.989
He better not, I'm just
afraid will go after you.

24:48.990 --> 24:51.999
He's not going to go after me.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.539
I'm going to talk to him.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.999
I will talk to him to see
where his head is really at.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.989
Hopefully he honors the
scamper squad.

24:59.990 --> 25:05.989
It doesn't make sense.

25:05.990 --> 25:13.990
Math wise it doesn't make sense.

25:14.990 --> 25:19.409
Within okay, I don't want to
touch these so you touch

25:19.410 --> 25:20.999
them.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.289
I think we're good.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.989
I'm scared.

25:25.990 --> 25:29.829
I think he is going to put
you up.

25:29.830 --> 25:30.989
He goes no he's not.

25:30.990 --> 25:38.990
I think he's going to put...
>> during these... hearing

25:51.990 --> 25:54.989
these words from Austin just
solidifies that no one else

25:54.990 --> 25:58.989
is ever going to have my
back like my twin sister is.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.989
If something shady is afoot
with Austin an Steve that

26:01.990 --> 26:04.989
he's not telling me, I have
no problem cutting him off

26:04.990 --> 26:12.990
just like I want to cut off
his ponytail beard.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.989
You just did not put him
up and you're going respect

26:16.990 --> 26:17.990
that.

26:17.990 --> 26:18.990
Remember we shook on it.

26:18.991 --> 26:21.989
If either of you win hoh
today I'm not going up,

26:21.990 --> 26:22.290
right.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.989
No, no, no.

26:24.990 --> 26:27.989
You got that I have that
from you.

26:27.990 --> 26:28.410
A shake.

26:28.411 --> 26:31.989
And no offense, Austin
has never even been on the

26:31.990 --> 26:33.990
block so,.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.829
Who wants to see my hoh room.

26:43.830 --> 26:43.990
Whooo!

26:43.991 --> 26:45.119
Not me but okay.

26:45.120 --> 26:45.990
Where is everyone?

26:45.991 --> 26:53.991
Oh my God, that is insane.

26:57.990 --> 26:58.990
Oh.

26:58.990 --> 26:59.990
Harrison.

26:59.991 --> 27:01.989
I got a picture of Harrison.

27:01.990 --> 27:04.989
He's so cute.

27:04.990 --> 27:10.989
Oh my God, this bear is so cute.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.989
Superstylish, you better
wear those.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.989
High school graduation.

27:14.990 --> 27:16.989
Oh wow.

27:16.990 --> 27:17.990
12012.

27:17.990 --> 27:18.990
Your mom is pretty.

27:18.991 --> 27:21.989
Your faces are identical.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.989
I feel like he looks like
his dad, the eyes are his

27:23.990 --> 27:24.990
dad.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.949
I just sit back watching this.

27:26.950 --> 27:30.989
All I'm noticing is that the
twins are all about Steve.

27:30.990 --> 27:31.990
Oh my God, is that you?

27:31.990 --> 27:32.990
That's me.

27:32.991 --> 27:35.699
Oh my God.

27:35.700 --> 27:36.999
Oh my God, Steve!

27:37.000 --> 27:41.989
You're hoh and we love you now.

27:41.990 --> 27:45.989
Were you valedictorian.

27:45.990 --> 27:46.990
What.

27:46.990 --> 27:46.991
Second.

27:46.991 --> 27:51.989
You were salutorian oh my
God, Steve, father our

27:51.990 --> 27:53.989
babies.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.999
Cocoa is so comfy, I like coco.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.989
All this kissing up and
lady charm you have might

27:59.990 --> 28:02.989
work on Austin but it's not
going to work on Steve.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.539
Thank you Big Brother.

28:04.540 --> 28:11.989
And thank you mommy and daddy.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.409
So here's all I need to
say, do you know what are

28:15.410 --> 28:15.990
you thinking.

28:15.990 --> 28:15.991
Yeah.

28:15.991 --> 28:18.989
What are you thinking.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.829
Twins.

28:20.830 --> 28:21.410
Okay.

28:21.411 --> 28:23.989
Here's what I think that is
actually a bad idea.

28:23.990 --> 28:24.990
Have you thought about it.

28:24.991 --> 28:27.119
No.

28:27.120 --> 28:32.989
Everybody... is going to
take down Liz.

28:32.990 --> 28:36.989
Lindsey is going to take
Austin down, all you need is

28:36.990 --> 28:42.989
two...
>> Julia?

28:42.990 --> 28:48.989
Yeah w she is the least
likely to win veto.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.989
The only way they don't
get broken up this week is

28:51.990 --> 28:54.699
if the third one of them is
not on the block wins the

28:54.700 --> 28:56.989
veto, takes one of them on
the block offer the block.

28:56.990 --> 28:59.989
In order to make sure this
doesn't happen we need to

28:59.990 --> 29:02.989
leave the weakest competitor
of the three, Julia, off the

29:02.990 --> 29:03.999
block.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.989
They could control the vote.

29:05.990 --> 29:10.829
And they put have whoever
I need as a replacement.

29:10.830 --> 29:14.989
If Julia wins I think I
could convince her not

29:14.990 --> 29:16.989
to... if we agree to keep her
sister.

29:16.990 --> 29:24.990
I would give her my word on
my mother.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.989
It's just my opinion, I
will respect whatever

29:28.990 --> 29:36.990
opinion whatever you do, I
respect.

29:40.990 --> 29:41.990
Understand.

29:41.991 --> 29:42.990
Got it.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.989
Now you understand.

29:44.990 --> 29:45.990
So no matter what.

29:45.991 --> 29:47.990
No matter what

29:58.990 --> 30:01.989
Steve.

30:01.990 --> 30:03.989
Steve, have you ever been
in love?

30:03.990 --> 30:04.990
Yes.

30:04.991 --> 30:09.289
Did you tell a girl, I love you.

30:09.290 --> 30:09.990
No.

30:09.991 --> 30:12.989
Steve, why didn't you tell her?

30:12.990 --> 30:14.949
It wasn't right.

30:14.950 --> 30:17.989
Was it unrequieted love.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.119
Has been, definitely has been.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.989
Well, you know the one
woman that you need to love

30:23.990 --> 30:25.949
is your mommy, your mommy.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.949
I do love my mommy.

30:27.950 --> 30:28.830
In the mommy way.

30:28.831 --> 30:29.989
Of course.

30:29.990 --> 30:33.989
Not in a Sigmund Freud way.

30:33.990 --> 30:37.119
A Sigmund Freud way, what
is that.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.989
Do you know significant
money Freud.

30:39.990 --> 30:45.989
The lion guy, the lion
gum trainer there is a show

30:45.990 --> 30:49.989
in Las Vegas, Sigmund and Freud.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.989
You mean penn and teller.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.949
Aren't those the lion
people in Vegas.

30:54.950 --> 30:57.989
The lion bit one of the guys.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.989
Zig Reed and Roy.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.989
Oh my God!

31:01.990 --> 31:09.990
I'm lolling at myself.

31:11.990 --> 31:18.409
I know you don't
like... oh my God, Jesus, to

31:18.410 --> 31:25.989
me, you, he's... he likes to
make out a lot.

31:25.990 --> 31:27.989
Ew, not ew, Julia.

31:27.990 --> 31:29.989
I have already told him.

31:29.990 --> 31:32.989
There's not much I can do
any more.

31:32.990 --> 31:40.989
You know it chafes your cheeks.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.999
I don't want to know everything.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.989
I don't think he knows
what to do with his tongue,

31:45.990 --> 31:48.999
what is he going to do with it.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.989
No.

31:50.990 --> 31:53.989
Because... he just... just
like that.

31:53.990 --> 31:54.999
No, I don't know what it is.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.989
It just...
>> come on.

31:56.990 --> 31:59.989
Does he get saliva all over
your lips.

31:59.990 --> 32:04.989
No, it's not...
>> oh God, he's here.

32:04.990 --> 32:05.990
Hello.

32:05.990 --> 32:06.990
What are you talking about?

32:06.991 --> 32:07.999
Nothing.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.990
Girl talk.

32:08.990 --> 32:09.990
Girl talk.

32:09.991 --> 32:12.699
Oh.

32:12.700 --> 32:18.119
You have a bingeie.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.989
That was so dumb.

32:20.990 --> 32:22.699
Why did they... me.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.949
Whatever you did, it
worked and it shouldn't

32:25.950 --> 32:26.120
have.

32:26.121 --> 32:28.989
Now it's time to play the game.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.829
The question is just how.

32:31.830 --> 32:33.989
What I need to do is make
sure that the three of us

32:33.990 --> 32:34.999
survive this week.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.699
Vanessa had the argument
that Julia is still the

32:37.700 --> 32:38.700
weakest competitor.

32:38.701 --> 32:43.989
I feel like best move is
Austin and Liz up.

32:43.990 --> 32:46.989
You think Austin is the
course to take?

32:46.990 --> 32:51.409
I think it's better for
us, you and me personally.

32:51.410 --> 32:55.989
And just in case it is a
physical hoh I would rather

32:55.990 --> 32:59.989
fight the twins.

32:59.990 --> 33:03.989
Other problem, if one of
the twins leaves this week,

33:03.990 --> 33:06.989
I've seen a lot of potential
for Vanessa and Austin to

33:06.990 --> 33:07.990
hookup.

33:07.991 --> 33:11.289
So you're saying the
advantage of cutting Austin

33:11.290 --> 33:13.989
is that we cut that off.

33:13.990 --> 33:19.989
I mean, its whatever you
want to do but got to think

33:19.990 --> 33:22.829
about next week.

33:22.830 --> 33:23.410
One comes back.

33:23.411 --> 33:24.989
John is bringing up a
really good point.

33:24.990 --> 33:26.989
I haven't been thinking
enough about.

33:26.990 --> 33:28.989
Austin and Vanessa have been
really tight throughout this

33:28.990 --> 33:29.990
game.

33:29.991 --> 33:32.989
If I go to Austin this week
will make sure that I'm

33:32.990 --> 33:35.989
Vanessa's number one loyalty
and not him.

33:35.990 --> 33:39.989
You are right about Austin.

33:39.990 --> 33:42.999
Targetsing him because of
Vanessa.

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
You're totally right.

33:51.700 --> 33:52.989
It's a lot to think about.

33:52.990 --> 33:53.990
Thank you tore talking to me.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.990
Yeah.

33:54.991 --> 34:02.991
I'm going to silt here and cry.

34:08.990 --> 34:10.989
I've been working with
Austin for a really long

34:10.990 --> 34:13.409
time in this game and I am
really dreading the

34:13.410 --> 34:15.289
possibility of putting him up.

34:15.290 --> 34:16.989
However because of how long
I've been working with him,

34:16.990 --> 34:20.989
I do owe it to him to warn
him before the nomination

34:20.990 --> 34:28.990
ceremony that it might not
go as he planned

34:38.990 --> 34:46.990
.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.989
Did I wake you up?

35:17.990 --> 35:25.990
No, it's okay.

35:34.950 --> 35:37.989
I'm sorry for waking you up.

35:37.990 --> 35:39.989
What have you got?

35:39.990 --> 35:42.989
I just want to let you
know this ahead of time.

35:42.990 --> 35:50.990
I don't think I can put the
twins up against each other.

35:51.700 --> 35:51.990
Why?

35:51.991 --> 35:56.999
I just feel like it's... I
feel like it's too much of a

35:57.000 --> 35:57.990
slap in the face.

35:57.991 --> 36:00.989
So you want to put me up
with one of them?

36:00.990 --> 36:04.989
I have the votes, Austin.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.989
I have the votes.

36:06.990 --> 36:07.000
Johnnie's good.

36:07.001 --> 36:09.989
People have told me I
have votes.

36:09.990 --> 36:17.990
I just wanted...
>> so who, me and Liz?

36:18.990 --> 36:20.989
Who is your target?

36:20.990 --> 36:24.699
I don't know.

36:24.700 --> 36:32.700
I just... I don't even... I
don't even... I don't want

36:32.950 --> 36:35.989
you going this week.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.989
Steve telling me I'm safe
means to me that he's trying

36:38.990 --> 36:40.989
to take Liz out of this game.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.989
Unfortunately I'm at a point
if the game where I have to

36:42.990 --> 36:45.989
think for myself first and
at the end of the day if Liz

36:45.990 --> 36:49.989
and I are meant to be than
she will understand what I

36:49.990 --> 36:49.991
have to do.

36:49.991 --> 36:52.699
But hopefully I can leave
this game with the money and

36:52.700 --> 36:52.990
her.

36:52.991 --> 36:55.989
I don't know, if you want
to put us up, you can... I

36:55.990 --> 36:57.989
means that's...
>> I just felt like I wanted

36:57.990 --> 37:03.949
to give you... I'm not saying
anything officially but I

37:03.950 --> 37:07.949
just... wanted to give you...
>> how come you came to

37:07.950 --> 37:07.990
that?

37:07.991 --> 37:10.989
Because I feel like
putting the two girls up is

37:10.990 --> 37:14.989
just too much.

37:14.990 --> 37:15.990
And I'm sorry.

37:15.991 --> 37:17.989
You understand what a
position I'm in and why I

37:17.990 --> 37:23.989
have to do what I'm doing.

37:23.990 --> 37:26.829
Uh-huh.

37:26.830 --> 37:29.989
How does Liz feel about
it, have you talked to her?

37:29.990 --> 37:31.989
The votes are there Austin.

37:31.990 --> 37:34.989
But I want you to say.

37:34.990 --> 37:36.989
Thank you.

37:36.990 --> 37:38.989
Are you saying that you
really want me to stay.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.119
I do want to you stay.

37:40.120 --> 37:40.990
Okay.

37:40.991 --> 37:44.989
I mean if that's the case,
I have to trust you.

37:44.990 --> 37:45.990
It's going to be sad.

37:45.991 --> 37:49.989
This game does that when
you get down to six people.

37:49.990 --> 37:52.409
Yeah.

37:52.410 --> 37:54.989
Austin, I love you, man,
you've been a great friend

37:54.990 --> 37:57.989
in this game but you're too
much of a threat to take any

37:57.990 --> 37:58.830
further.

37:58.831 --> 38:01.699
You haven't even gotten on
the block and we are in the

38:01.700 --> 38:01.990
final six.

38:01.991 --> 38:03.989
I don't know how much
further I can let you stay

38:03.990 --> 38:04.990
in this game.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.989
Fair enough, I understand.

38:06.990 --> 38:08.990
Thank you for your maturity.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.989
One of my
responsibilities as the head

38:26.990 --> 38:30.990
of household is to nominate
two people for eviction.

38:32.990 --> 38:36.989
This nomination ceremony
is going to help us realize

38:36.990 --> 38:38.989
who Steve is most loyal to.

38:38.990 --> 38:43.989
If he puts up two people
from the scamper squad that

38:43.990 --> 38:46.989
means he is most loyal to
Johnnie mack and they want

38:46.990 --> 38:49.949
to go to final two together.

38:49.950 --> 38:52.989
I'm not feeling too great
going into nominations.

38:52.990 --> 38:56.949
I feel like Steve is about
to make a move and put me on

38:56.950 --> 38:56.990
the block.

38:56.991 --> 39:00.949
I don't think I'm his target
but this is "Big Brother" so

39:00.950 --> 39:01.989
you never know.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.989
My goal for the next seven
days is to do whatever I can

39:03.990 --> 39:05.989
to insurance my safety and
hopefully I can keep at

39:05.990 --> 39:08.989
least one of the twins safe
as well.

39:08.990 --> 39:11.409
I'm feeling so nervous
going into this nomination

39:11.410 --> 39:11.990
ceremony.

39:11.991 --> 39:14.989
I think Steve is going to
put me up on the block

39:14.990 --> 39:19.539
against my sister so I just
have to take it like a big

39:19.540 --> 39:27.540
girl.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.989
This is a really
difficult decision to make

39:30.990 --> 39:34.989
because I'm not aligned
with... now aligned with

39:34.990 --> 39:38.989
literally everybody in the
how no matter what I do I

39:38.990 --> 39:41.989
will break an alliance and
someone will be really mad

39:41.990 --> 39:42.540
at me.

39:42.541 --> 39:44.990
I just hope I can make the
right decision.

39:48.990 --> 39:52.990
Hi, everyone, it's time
for the nomination ceremony.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.989
This is the nomination ceremony.

40:08.990 --> 40:12.989
It is my responsibility as
the head of household to

40:12.990 --> 40:15.989
nominate two house guests
for eviction.

40:15.990 --> 40:19.989
I will turn two keys to lock
in my nomination and their

40:19.990 --> 40:22.989
faces will appear on the
memmory wall.

40:22.990 --> 40:25.990
The first house guest I've
nominated is...

40:33.950 --> 40:36.950
The next house guest I've
nominated is:.

40:50.410 --> 40:54.989
I've nominated you,
Austin, and you Liz for

40:54.990 --> 40:55.990
eviction.

40:55.991 --> 41:02.829
Some of may favorite times
in this house have been

41:02.830 --> 41:06.989
doing chess or being very
sneaky.

41:06.990 --> 41:09.989
I just want to you know that
everything I shared with you

41:09.990 --> 41:13.989
is genuine and I'm simply
making the move that is best

41:13.990 --> 41:16.829
for my game.

41:16.830 --> 41:23.699
And I'm sorry.

41:23.700 --> 41:31.700
I'm such a baby.

41:33.410 --> 41:39.989
This nomination
ceremony is adjourned.

41:39.990 --> 41:43.989
The boy, Steve, put me up
on the block with my

41:43.990 --> 41:44.000
girlfriend.

41:44.001 --> 41:48.989
If I win that veto, the boy
is going to have to become a

41:48.990 --> 41:50.989
man rel quick.

41:50.990 --> 41:53.989
Because your mommy is not here.

41:53.990 --> 41:54.990
Only juddas is.

41:54.991 --> 41:58.989
Being on the block next
to my boo Austin is the

41:58.990 --> 41:59.410
absolute worst.

41:59.411 --> 42:02.989
I feel really betrayed by
Steve because I have been

42:02.990 --> 42:05.989
really close with him this
entire game.

42:05.990 --> 42:09.989
My sister and I have been
nothing but nice to him and

42:09.990 --> 42:14.989
making him feel like he's
not such a socially awkward

42:14.990 --> 42:14.991
nerd.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.289
Oh, I hate when I cry.

42:17.290 --> 42:17.990
I'm not going to cry.

42:17.991 --> 42:21.989
By nominating Austin and
Liz I'm essentially killing

42:21.990 --> 42:22.990
the scamper squad.

42:22.991 --> 42:24.989
I'm not going to contribute
anything to an alliance that

42:24.990 --> 42:26.989
has nothing left to give to me.

42:26.990 --> 42:29.949
Austin and I will is on
the block that means Steve

42:29.950 --> 42:32.989
followed my advice, although
I love them on a personal

42:32.990 --> 42:34.989
level, strategically this is
what I needed to see.

42:34.990 --> 42:35.990
Targeting the twins this
week will greatly increase

42:35.991 --> 42:38.989
my chances of making it to
the final three.

42:38.990 --> 42:43.989
Who will win power of
veto and will it be saved

42:43.990 --> 42:45.989
for either Austin or Liz.
