00:03.671 --> 00:04.605
How much do you want?

00:04.638 --> 00:06.107
DANG:
For him? Nothing.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.308
You, on the other hand,

00:07.341 --> 00:08.542
your future
now in the hand

00:08.576 --> 00:09.643
of the highest bidder.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.581
CHEGWIDDEN: I take it you don't
know where she is either.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.615
She's selling
all her properties.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.750
Raising capital.
For what?

00:16.784 --> 00:19.053
Damned if I know,
but clearly it's expensive.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.589
Does anyone know
you're here?
No.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.124
But they'll figure it out.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.492
How can you be sure?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.759
I trained them.

00:25.793 --> 00:29.297
And I left them
the tools to do this.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.233
It's only a matter of time.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.675
*

00:45.779 --> 00:48.149
HETTY :
This reminds me...

00:48.182 --> 00:51.619
of the night I saw
Salvador DalÃ­...

00:51.652 --> 00:55.389
kill a werewolf.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.506
Smooth.

01:16.710 --> 01:20.248
I know it seems like the others

01:20.281 --> 01:23.451
get all the glory.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.387
But they would not be able
to do half of what they do

01:26.420 --> 01:27.588
without your abilities.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.759
Thank you, Hetty.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.806
What's this?

01:51.545 --> 01:56.384
It's a gift of my appreciation
for what you do.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.888
I don't know what to say.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.459
You don't need to.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.195
You don't need to.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.796
ERIC:
No, Hetty.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.699
For the love of Gamera.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.914
*

02:47.835 --> 02:50.271
What the hell's going on?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.905
I'm sorry I woke
you up. I just...
Yeah.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.908
I had this crazy
dream last night

02:54.942 --> 02:56.910
that reminded me that
Hetty gave me this book.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.580
Okay.
And I don't know, I
just felt like maybe,

02:59.613 --> 03:01.215
it was a sign, you know?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.816
Okay.
Like a clue
as to where she went,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.852
but I've been through
every page.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.587
Nothing.
Okay.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.589
Let's just slow down, Eric.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.923
When did she give you this book?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.925
I don't know.
After Michelle died.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.661
What? Eric, that was months ago.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.928
You never told me.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.831
I know, but it just seemed like
a nice gesture at the time.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.833
Plus, it was a while before
she actually disappeared.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.702
Okay, fine, I get it.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.904
Um, let's think.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.906
I don't know,
maybe the book is the clue.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.941
Well, it takes place
in the Civil War,

03:27.975 --> 03:29.843
so unless she went
back in time...

03:29.877 --> 03:32.012
Well, I wouldn't put anything
past Hetty, so...

03:32.045 --> 03:33.847
Where does it
take place?

03:33.881 --> 03:34.782
Well, it doesn't say.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.917
It's fiction,
but most historians agree

03:36.950 --> 03:37.918
that it's pretty close

03:37.951 --> 03:40.288
to the Battle of
Chancellorsville in Virginia.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.422
Okay.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.890
I mean, we know she
sailed to Hawaii,

03:42.923 --> 03:45.426
and then, who knows?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.761
All right, well, maybe the clue
is within the title,

03:47.795 --> 03:48.762
or, like,
one of the characters?

03:48.796 --> 03:51.365
Or maybe it's just
an overactive imagination,

03:51.399 --> 03:53.834
and too much Chunky Monkey
before bed.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.803
I don't know. I mean,
she never gave me a book.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.473
The only thing she gave me
was this survival key chain.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.808
I even went through it
with a blacklight,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.677
to see if she circled
anything in invisible ink.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.845
Nothing.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.447
What is that?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.881
It's got this
little red flashlight.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.450
Damn it.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.884
It's dead.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.952
Where are you going?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.388
Batteries. Come on,
bring that book.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.391
Why?

04:17.425 --> 04:19.527
Wait, so what are you thinking?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.929
Hetty wrote something
in this book

04:21.962 --> 04:23.297
that you can only see
with your light?

04:23.331 --> 04:24.465
Exactly.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.469
Give me a second.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.971
All right, yes.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.406
We're in business.
All right.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.574
All right, hold this.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.075
I'm gonna flipbook it.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.612
Come on, come on...

04:39.647 --> 04:40.981
Hmm.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.816
Nell, I think this
was a good idea,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.985
but we're both victims
of wishful thinking here.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.055
Whoa. Did you see that?

04:49.723 --> 04:52.560
Holy glowing gonads.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.894
I'm-I'm tired.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.429
"Failed."

04:55.463 --> 04:57.798
Keep flipping.
Mm-hmm.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.969
There. "Action."

05:02.002 --> 05:04.405
ERIC:
"Failed action."

05:04.438 --> 05:05.673
Yeah.
What failed action?

05:05.706 --> 05:06.974
S-Should we tell someone
what we've found?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.677
I mean, what exactly
have we found?
Yeah.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.978
We're gonna need
more coffee.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.513
Let's go.

05:17.017 --> 05:17.951
This couldn't have waited

05:17.985 --> 05:20.087
till morning?

05:20.120 --> 05:23.624
"Failed Action Skin."

05:23.657 --> 05:24.725
What does it mean?

05:24.758 --> 05:25.826
ERIC:
I don't know.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.994
Hetty circled them in an ink

05:27.027 --> 05:28.829
that only fluoresces
under certain light.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.364
She gave me
the book,

05:30.398 --> 05:32.433
and Nell, the light
to read it with.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.101
And you just
realized this now?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.936
Well, to be fair, I didn't
know Eric had this book.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.006
I had no idea it had anything
to do with her disappearance

05:39.039 --> 05:39.907
until I had this dream
last night,

05:39.940 --> 05:41.909
where I was chasing
this honey badger,

05:41.942 --> 05:43.911
and I was in
my avocado disguise,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.713
and then I saw myself
in the office

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
with Hetty,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.649
and we were drinking scotch.
Stop.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.083
I don't want to hear
if this gets weird

05:50.117 --> 05:51.485
with you and Hetty in any way.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.086
What? No!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.755
What are you talk...?
Although,

05:54.788 --> 05:56.390
once I had a dream that

05:56.424 --> 05:58.592
Hetty and I were in a hot tub
with Charles Nelson Reilly

05:58.626 --> 06:01.094
and Grimace,
and that did get disturbing.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.664
I still hate bubbles.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.032
Oh, God.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.167
Is this code for something?

06:07.200 --> 06:10.170
Maybe, but we still
don't know what.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.739
We've searched the Internet,

06:11.772 --> 06:13.707
our files, you name it.
We've tried it

06:13.741 --> 06:15.443
as a password in our system,
but nothing.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.078
So it's a Hail Mary.
It was definitely hard to find.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.580
In fact, you wouldn't have
found it

06:19.613 --> 06:20.848
unless you were looking for it.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.450
Which suggests

06:22.483 --> 06:25.052
it's a failsafe
in case things went wrong.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.654
She also designed it
so that it took

06:26.687 --> 06:28.155
two of you to crack it,
which would only happen

06:28.188 --> 06:29.590
if we were all worried
about her.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.024
Hmm.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.860
At least she left us
some breadcrumbs.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.828
Hmm. Breadcrumbs may
have been more useful.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.163
Not to be a Debbie Downer,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.099
but we still have no idea
what any of this means.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.668
Did she give you
anything?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.036
I mean, maybe we need another
piece to solve the puzzle.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.005
No.
Well,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.640
I guess she figured
we're the only two

06:46.674 --> 06:47.975
smart enough
to figure it out.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.613
No.
Kidding.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.814
NELL:
Don't.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.516
ERIC:
I'm kidding.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.552
Not kidding.
Yeah.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.039
Ms. Lange, I'm so glad
we could find you.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.143
I'm Spencer Allen. I'm with
the U.S. State Department.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.146
We've made arrangements
to have you taken

07:26.179 --> 07:27.881
to a hospital.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.850
Is there someone we can call

07:29.883 --> 07:31.184
on your behalf?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.053
I'm sure your
family has been

07:33.086 --> 07:35.956
terribly worried about you.

07:38.826 --> 07:42.162
My brother called me Milly.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.534
I didn't like that.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.673
I-I wasn't aware

07:52.706 --> 07:54.842
you had a brother.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.845
Uh... where does he live?

07:59.647 --> 08:04.284
Uh, once I got my hair
caught in the fence,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.587
and he cut it off!

08:06.620 --> 08:10.558
Now I can't wear braids.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.126
Ms. Lange...

08:13.160 --> 08:15.095
do you know
where you are?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
I...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.235
I just have
to be patient.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.606
My mother kept the ribbons

08:25.639 --> 08:29.943
for me until it grows back.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.145
What did you do to her?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.681
DANG:
Nothing.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.783
She's not even lucid.
She's faking!

08:37.985 --> 08:40.954
Where are you going?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.190
I'm calling my embassy.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.262
You think you're funny?!

08:49.296 --> 08:52.032
Huh?! You think
you're funny?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.069
:
Oh, God.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.873
You don't even have the guts.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.142
Come on.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.913
Come on. What you waiting for?

09:05.946 --> 09:08.682
Pull the trigger... bitch.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.693
Ms. Lange,
the authorities

09:19.727 --> 09:21.895
have no record of you
entering the country.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.931
How did you get here?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.939
Henrietta?

09:35.175 --> 09:38.145
One time,

09:38.178 --> 09:42.816
my father took me
on a riverboat

09:42.850 --> 09:45.252
after church.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.890
That's very interesting.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.731
DANG :
You think you're funny?

09:57.765 --> 09:59.299
HETTY :
Oh, God.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.869
You don't even have the guts.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.837
Come on.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.639
Come on. What you waiting for?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.008
Pull the trigger... bitch.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.247
I respect that you would

10:14.281 --> 10:17.951
rather die
than betray your country.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.988
I truly do, but...

10:21.021 --> 10:24.124
I'm paying good money for you,

10:24.157 --> 10:27.227
so, you will give
up your secrets.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.337
One way or another.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.418
DEEKS: You got to be honest,
this would be a whole lot easier

10:51.451 --> 10:53.787
if Hetty just gave us all
secret decoder rings.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.155
I mean, what are we
even looking for?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.224
Looking for clues.
'Cause she couldn't

10:57.257 --> 10:59.259
just left a Post-it note
on her refrigerator

10:59.292 --> 11:00.694
like everybody else?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.195
Well, she did grow up
in the Cold War.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.764
Ah, she probably started
the Cold War.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.698
Yeah, well...

11:04.732 --> 11:06.867
admittedly, her methods
can be a little...

11:06.900 --> 11:09.703
Extreme Ridiculous?

11:09.737 --> 11:12.105
I was gonna say "old school."

11:12.139 --> 11:14.307
Yeah, definitely
old school.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.009
Like the Roaring Twenties.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
Man...

11:19.412 --> 11:20.781
What's that?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.152
Oh.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.225
You know, most days I still find
myself going to call Granger.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.731
I don't want to
go through that again.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.366
Well, the good news is
you're not gonna have to

11:39.399 --> 11:40.367
because Hetty,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.269
Hetty's coming back.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.037
You don't know that, Deeks.
I do.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.740
I positively do.
I know that for sure.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.441
You want to know
how I know that?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.177
How?
'Cause there's no way

11:50.210 --> 11:53.881
that she could live her life
without this.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.283
: What the hell
is that?
I'm not sure.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.151
But I'm pretty sure
if we boiled it down

11:58.185 --> 12:00.821
in hydrochloric acid,
we'd find, like, a note inside.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.189
Okay, now you're just mocking.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.992
:
Kensi, do you want to snuggle?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.760
KENSI: You're ridiculous.
DEEKS: Do you want to spoon?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.430
What the hell
are you doing?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.500
Like, right this moment
or in my life?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.535
KENSI: Okay, Eric and Nell
found a hidden message

12:15.568 --> 12:17.771
in a book that Hetty gave Eric.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.206
We think it might contain a clue

12:19.239 --> 12:21.141
as to where she is.
What'd it say?

12:21.174 --> 12:22.275
We're still trying
to decipher that.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.311
Where are the others?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.079
Callen and Sam are also
looking for clues.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.348
So this takes precedence
over all our other cases?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.350
No, of course not.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.386
What she said with the,
with the no.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.521
Of course not.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.257
Okay, tell Callen and Sam
to please report to my office.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.491
Will do.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.398
Where's Agent Callen?

12:45.432 --> 12:47.067
Uh, he's with Sam
in the armory

12:47.100 --> 12:48.535
going through some
of Hetty's things.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.303
So Hetty left you guys
a coded message?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.905
Yeah, we think so.
Mm-hmm.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.907
What3words.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.243
Uh, the three words
that we're all looking at

12:56.276 --> 12:58.211
on the screen.
Is this the right order?

12:58.245 --> 13:01.148
Well, it's the order
we found them in, though,

13:01.181 --> 13:02.816
the chronological
order in the book was:

13:02.850 --> 13:04.151
skin, failed, action.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.319
I mean, the "failed action"
I get, but...

13:06.353 --> 13:08.188
I don't understand what
the "skin" is referring to.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.389
NELL:
Yeah.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.423
It's what3words.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.295
Um...

13:15.328 --> 13:19.032
It's the three words that
we're looking at on the screen.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.301
What3words is a geocoding system

13:21.334 --> 13:23.336
that maps the world
into three meter squares

13:23.370 --> 13:25.572
which are each given a unique
three word identification.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.275
Okay.
Oh.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.277
"Skin failed action"
is nine square meters

13:30.310 --> 13:31.344
somewhere on the planet.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.046
So that would be...

13:35.382 --> 13:37.017
It's Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.285
ERIC:
Wow.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.853
Great job.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.422
Thanks for that.
Yeah.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.461
Find anything?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.363
I think this is a waste of time.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.867
Yeah, well, everybody
loves a scavenger hunt.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.002
Ah, you're right.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.204
But you got to admit, she left
something in that book.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.473
Yeah, okay, maybe, but why
make it so damn hard to find?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.609
My thinking is that she didn't
want us to figure it out

14:02.642 --> 14:03.810
until we were looking for it.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.046
That way, we wouldn't find her
until she was in trouble.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.148
You think she's in trouble?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.416
ERIC:
We broke it.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.550
It's not a code.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.285
Oh, Hidoko broke it.
It's a place.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.320
Hidoko?
Yeah.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.321
What place?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
Vietnam.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.361
You find her?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.964
Not yet. We think
she may be someplace

14:23.997 --> 14:25.966
in Ho Chi Minh City,
thanks to Hidoko.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.267
Nice work.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.268
Thanks.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.469
SAM:
Is there something specific

14:29.502 --> 14:31.404
at that location?
Uh, sat footage

14:31.438 --> 14:32.973
and street views
are coming up.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.241
DEEKS: That's
a long way to go

14:34.274 --> 14:35.575
for a cocktail.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.310
Can we get eyes
inside that bar?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.412
That's a lot to ask,
don't you think?
NELL: Well, I mean,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.281
if it's a popular spot,
we should be able

14:41.314 --> 14:43.917
to pull up some
social media postings, right?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.585
SAM: This is the area
of responsibility...

14:45.618 --> 14:47.387
...for NCIS Singapore.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.622
Contact their office,
see if they heard anything.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.358
Looks like we're
headed to Westminster.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.560
What's in Westminster?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.929
Largest Vietnamese population
outside of their own country.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.763
A lot of families
and individuals

14:56.796 --> 14:57.730
settled there after
the conflict.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.633
Probably our best source
of intel stateside.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.236
I thought they were
going to the dog show.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.172
That's a different
Westminster.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.475
HETTY:
Intery, mintery, cutery corn.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.543
Apple seed and apple thorn.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.380
Wire, brier, limber lock.
Three wild geese

15:13.413 --> 15:15.182
fly in flock.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.451
One flew east...
Sounds like she's
casting a spell.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.087
And one flew over
the cuckoo's nest.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.688
It's an old children's
nursery rhyme.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.290
Intery, mintery,

15:23.323 --> 15:25.492
cutery corn.
What does it mean?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.594
HETTY: Apple seed
and apple thorn.
Nothing. It's nonsense.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.062
That's the point.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
Wire, brier, limber lock.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.399
She's using a self-induced
palilalia

15:32.432 --> 15:34.501
to keep her mind focused.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.702
One flew east...

15:35.735 --> 15:38.438
Or maybe she...

15:38.471 --> 15:40.707
really is a witch.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.445
Intery, mintery,
cutery corn.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.047
Apple seed and apple thorn.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.748
You can stop now.
Wire, brier,

15:48.781 --> 15:50.650
limber lock.
Three wild geese

15:50.683 --> 15:53.253
fly in flock.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.288
One flew east
and one flew west...
You're wasting time.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.458
There's no such thing
as a truth serum.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.698
Intery, mintery,
cutery corn.

16:05.732 --> 16:10.303
Apple seed
and apple thorn.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.405
Wire, brier,
limber lock.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.142
Three wild geese fly in a flock.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.244
One flew east
and one flew west...

16:28.388 --> 16:32.659
And one flew over
the cuckoo's nest.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.405
MOSLEY:
Enter.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.042
Where the hell is Callen?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.310
He and Hanna are on
their way to Westminster.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.111
Why?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.046
I believe to
question some sources.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.214
Did you tell him that
I wanted to see him?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.215
Yes, ma'am.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.184
And where are the others?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.052
Not sure.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.788
So I have a mutiny on my hands.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.357
I don't think you should
look at it like that.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.758
Well, how should I look at it?

17:05.792 --> 17:08.061
Like teammates looking out
for one of their own.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.796
I'm sure they'd do the same
if it were you or me.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.133
I seriously doubt that, Hidoko.
All I know is,

17:13.166 --> 17:16.169
if I'm ever in trouble,
I want them on my side.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.538
Can you please go find out
where the others are?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.141
Yes, ma'am.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.352
Mosley.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.786
You gonna answer that?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.155
Not now.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.489
Well, good luck with that.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.725
We're in this together, hoss.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.494
She didn't call me.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.097
You were saying...?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.266
We're both gonna be
looking for jobs.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.401
Screw jobs. Let's move
your boat down to Mexico

17:48.435 --> 17:49.836
so you can open a dive shop.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.271
Hmm. What are you gonna do?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.540
Who do you think's
gonna tend bar?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.475
Think we can bring
Otis down there?

17:57.244 --> 17:58.878
MAN: Yeah, I'm back and forth
once a month.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.381
It's crazy. China's
out of control, too.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
If you boys were smart,
you'd be learning Mandarin.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.121
And your mother.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.262
We're looking for someone we
believe was in Ho Chi Minh City.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.563
Why are you asking me?
You should be talking

18:16.596 --> 18:18.265
to CÃ´ng an.
We will.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.899
But the police may
not be able to help.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.170
The person we're looking for is
probably keeping a low profile.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.172
In fact, we think she may
have snuck into the country.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.574
She

18:27.607 --> 18:30.210
A former colleague.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.911
Name is Henrietta Lange,

18:31.944 --> 18:33.813
but she may be
using an alias.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.149
I guarantee you
she's using an alias.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
Never seen her before.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.152
Sorry, boys,
can't help you.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.154
You can.
How?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.222
By cutting the crap.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.424
We know you're a
smuggler, Billy.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.926
I'm an import-export specialist.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.595
Yeah? I'm a jockey.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.230
Homeland Security has two
ongoing investigations

18:50.263 --> 18:51.898
into your
business practices.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.600
Innocent till proven guilty.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.435
Most of those are drummed up
charges by my competitors.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.603
You're a pirate.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.238
With probable cause,

18:58.271 --> 19:00.207
we can go through all
this stuff to prove it.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.408
But that's not our
concern right now.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.576
Right now, we're
just trying to find

19:03.610 --> 19:06.379
the location of
one little lady.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.383
You know a drug dealer
who operates over there,

19:10.417 --> 19:11.884
Tilo Iona?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.386
No.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.621
Of course you don't.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.289
Guys, seriously.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.557
Oh, we are serious.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.260
Hold on, let
me check, okay?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.894
Yeah. That's his
serious face.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.263
Hold on.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.597
Give him, um,
give him "deadly serious."

19:25.632 --> 19:27.234
You see that?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.100
There it is.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.936
Admittedly, it's subtle.
You have to know

19:29.969 --> 19:32.272
what you're looking for,
but it-it's definitely there.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.906
Look, trust me.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.408
You don't want to see

19:35.442 --> 19:39.279
his "sorry I hurt that guy
real bad" face.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.947
I'll try and make
some phone calls.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.549
You'll try to make
some phone calls?

19:42.582 --> 19:43.550
They're 14 hours ahead
over there.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.551
It's the middle
of the night.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.885
Crime never sleeps, Billy.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.954
You of all people should
know that. You got one hour.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.021
Then we're coming back
here with a search team.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.723
We're gonna rip
this place apart.
Okay, okay.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.659
I'll see what I can do.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.926
Great.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.664
Oh, look. You made him smile.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.010
NELL:
Hey, you find anything?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.246
Yeah.
I've discovered there are

20:13.280 --> 20:14.614
a lot of people out there

20:14.647 --> 20:17.350
who appear to be having
way more fun than I am.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.386
What? What are you
complaining about?

20:19.419 --> 20:20.787
You're the king
of cosplay,

20:20.820 --> 20:22.355
the baron
of Burning Man,

20:22.389 --> 20:23.890
the friar of furrydom.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.425
Holy smackers,
cheese and crackers.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.759
Who's that?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.595
I don't know, but I can run
them through facial rec.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.397
No, no. Sorry.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.300
There.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.269
What the what?
No way.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.339
MOSLEY:
Why the hell am I here?

20:39.372 --> 20:42.008
You're the executive
assistant director Pacific.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.310
Then how come I have
no damn idea

20:43.343 --> 20:44.311
where the rest of this unit is?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.512
Nobody has even had

20:45.545 --> 20:47.714
the decency of giving me
a sitrep.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.682
I thought Hidoko was
keeping you informed.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.451
She is keeping me informed,

20:51.484 --> 20:53.486
but that is not the point.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.524
It is becoming painfully obvious
that Agent Callen resents

20:57.557 --> 20:58.925
my presence here,
and it seems like

20:58.958 --> 21:00.660
it's rubbing off
on the rest of you.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.329
You don't get to do
whatever the hell you want

21:02.362 --> 21:03.696
when you want to do it.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.898
Callen, you need to get back
here as soon as possible.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.734
Mosley's on a warpath. She
just took a strip out of Kensi,

21:07.767 --> 21:08.868
and I'm pretty sure
she's sending me

21:08.901 --> 21:09.969
back to the dog pound.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.339
That is not a figure of
speech. It's, like, a room

21:12.372 --> 21:13.773
in the basement
with a bunch of dogs,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.007
and I don't-- just come back.
MOSLEY: This insubordination
ends today.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.411
And if it does not, I will make
sure that you are reassigned

21:18.445 --> 21:20.913
to a different continent.
A different continent?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.915
That doesn't sound
very good.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.050
Yeah, unless you like travel.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.918
Hey, I think
you're gonna want to see

21:25.952 --> 21:28.388
what Eric and I
just found up in Ops.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.856
Is it a new job for me?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.359
Mm. I'd take that back stairwell
if I were you.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.727
We have a back stairwell?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.429
You didn't know about that?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.398
Nobody tells me anything.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.436
Okay, Beale, talk to me.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.372
Recognize anyone?

21:46.473 --> 21:48.441
DEEKS:
Son of a bitch.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.042
Does Mosley know?
Yeah, Nell's supposed

21:50.076 --> 21:51.778
to be telling her.
This photo was posted

21:51.811 --> 21:53.446
six minutes ago.
They're still there.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.448
All right. Call 'em.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.687
Xin chÃ o.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.090
Um, hi. Do you
speak English?
Oh...

22:04.123 --> 22:06.759
Yes. Who is this?
Hi. My name is

22:06.793 --> 22:08.027
Eric Beale.
Mm.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.463
And I'm calling
from California. Yeah.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.932
In the United States of
America. And I just saw...
Condescending.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.601
...the photo that you posted.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.102
How did you get my number?

22:16.135 --> 22:18.505
Oh, well...
I-I work for a...

22:18.538 --> 22:21.040
for a federal law
enforcement agency.
No.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.142
Um, and I...

22:23.175 --> 22:24.511
Um, I...

22:24.544 --> 22:26.379
That was rude.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.313
Yeah, maybe we should
try something

22:27.346 --> 22:29.416
a little more personable,
a little less...

22:29.449 --> 22:30.550
creepy.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.419
All right.
Beam me up, Scotty.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.455
Put my... put my goods
on the screen.
Uh...

22:35.488 --> 22:36.923
Which means you got
to get over...

22:36.956 --> 22:39.392
Just-just this. Just this.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.461
Ready?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.130
DEEKS:
Hi!

22:44.163 --> 22:45.565
Hi, ladies. How are you?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.500
Listen, uh, my name is Max,

22:47.534 --> 22:49.802
and you guys are at my favorite
bar in Ho Chi Minh City.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.803
And, crazy enough,

22:50.837 --> 22:52.472
uh, my buddy is there,

22:52.505 --> 22:55.141
and he's the tall bald guy
in the back of the booth.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.743
Looks like a really...
a giant thumb.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.411
Yeah, that's him,
right in the back there.

22:58.445 --> 22:59.746
Listen, it's his birthday,

22:59.779 --> 23:01.548
so, if at all possible,
if you could walk over there

23:01.581 --> 23:02.915
and just show him the screen,

23:02.949 --> 23:04.417
and I'll wish him happy birthday
and then

23:04.451 --> 23:06.486
I'll buy all your drinks.
How's that sound?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.421
Hmm.
Deal?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.089
Okay.
Wonderful.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.758
Thank you so much.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.494
Oh. Bribery.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.563
Uh, I like
to call it charm, actually.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.730
Teach me?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.466
:
Yeah. Thanks.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.503
Can I help you?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.638
What's going on, gentlemen?

23:25.672 --> 23:27.940
Son of a bitch.
No, no. Don't run away.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:27.974 --> 23:31.077
We got a couple, uh...

23:31.110 --> 23:33.913
Hi. Thank you.
Ladies, thank you so much.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.048
And, as promised,
I am gonna get your drinks.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.517
This is my friend Randy...

23:37.550 --> 23:38.851
Wait. What...?
Here. Randy's gonna

23:38.885 --> 23:40.186
read you off his credit card.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.054
What...?
Go ahead, Randy.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.939
Keane?

23:59.972 --> 24:02.174
Keane,

24:02.208 --> 24:05.044
if you can hear me,

24:05.077 --> 24:06.979
I'm sorry.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.214
I'm so sorry.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.883
Me, too.

24:10.917 --> 24:15.522
I'm s-sorry
he didn't shoot me in the head.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.091
How bad is it?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.227
Somewhere between

24:21.260 --> 24:22.895
"don't worry about it"...

24:26.533 --> 24:29.502
...and "hello, Jesus."

24:36.543 --> 24:38.611
Even if I cooperate,

24:38.645 --> 24:40.246
this is not gonna
end well

24:40.279 --> 24:42.749
for either of us.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.520
Do you know the guy who shot me?

24:47.554 --> 24:49.155
No.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.090
No.
But I...

24:51.123 --> 24:53.593
I plan on killing him, too.

24:53.626 --> 24:56.796
I like your style.

24:59.265 --> 25:03.670
But I don't think
this one's swinging our way.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.674
I know.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.580
DANG:
I'm glad

25:13.613 --> 25:16.583
to see you're still alive.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.153
Can't say the same.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.991
I have a surprise for...

25:25.024 --> 25:26.593
you.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.860
DANG:
He's beautiful, no?

26:00.893 --> 26:03.029
We trapped him a few days ago,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.831
so he's very hungry.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.169
He go to Russia.
Some oligarch

26:10.202 --> 26:12.104
want to hunt him.
And I promise him

26:12.138 --> 26:13.973
a man-eater.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.727
HETTY:
Dang, you win!

26:34.761 --> 26:36.663
Stop this! Now!

26:36.696 --> 26:38.665
DANG: But he's
hungry!

26:38.698 --> 26:40.667
I'm dying anyway.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.201
Not this way!

26:44.070 --> 26:47.273
It-It'll be faster.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.641
Dang,

26:48.675 --> 26:50.877
I'm gonna do
what you want me to.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.713
Stop this, please. St... Now.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.915
Please.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.349
Just get him out!

26:57.383 --> 26:58.651
You no fun anymore.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.797
But don't feed him!

27:18.104 --> 27:19.405
I told you,

27:19.438 --> 27:22.374
my way is better.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.315
Enter.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.185
You wanted
to speak with us?

27:34.186 --> 27:36.255
Are you trying to be funny?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.991
We have reason
to believe that...
I know what you believe,

27:39.025 --> 27:41.027
Agent Hanna.
Unfortunately, no one had

27:41.060 --> 27:42.829
the decency
to inform me,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.097
so I had to figure it out
on my own.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.099
Well, we didn't want to bother
you with hearsay until we...

27:47.133 --> 27:48.134
Agent Callen,

27:48.167 --> 27:50.269
you can disagree with me,
you can dislike me,

27:50.302 --> 27:52.104
you can even curse
me, but please

27:52.138 --> 27:54.040
do not insult my intelligence.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.474
We think Hetty's in trouble,

27:55.507 --> 27:57.409
and we think we know
where she may be.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.045
Vietnam?

27:59.078 --> 28:00.346
Yes.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.914
Do you have any confirmation?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.315
No.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.051
But I know
that Admiral Chegwidden

28:05.084 --> 28:06.118
was looking
for her as well.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.487
We have confirmation
that he was in Ho Chi Minh City

28:08.520 --> 28:09.455
with Charles Langston.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.858
Admiral Bridges
is probably with them as well.

28:11.891 --> 28:12.859
Hetty's in trouble.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.093
They're trying to find her.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.863
Maybe it was just a reunion.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.232
Yes.

28:20.266 --> 28:23.235
HIDOKO:
Got SECNAV for you.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.772
Saved by the bell, gentlemen.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.440
Make yourselves scarce.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.145
You guys
get spanked?

28:33.179 --> 28:35.147
She was
definitely warming her arm up,

28:35.181 --> 28:37.083
but, uh,
SECNAV called.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.951
You find anything else?
Yeah, we tried reaching out

28:38.985 --> 28:41.921
to Chegwidden, Bridges,
and Langston, but no joy.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.255
A.J. knew we were
looking for Hetty.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.124
Yeah. These four
like to do things

28:45.157 --> 28:47.426
on their own.
KENSI: Yeah.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.228
Oh, my God, you guys, they're
like our future selves.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.998
Look at that.
Ooh, baby, you should probably

28:52.031 --> 28:53.532
consider doing some
calcium supplements.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.935
You should probably consider
some hair plugs.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.269
Ooh!
Ooh!

28:57.303 --> 28:59.171
You two sound
like you're married already.

28:59.205 --> 28:59.872
It's love.

28:59.906 --> 29:00.873
It's love.
Did someone alert

29:00.907 --> 29:04.176
SECNAV about what was happening?
MOSLEY: I did.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.845
DEEKS: Ooh, on the count of
three, everyone should run

29:05.878 --> 29:08.080
in different directions.
One, two-- ooh, too late.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.982
Unfortunately,
I didn't have as much intel

29:10.016 --> 29:12.284
as I would have liked, since
none of you deemed me worthy

29:12.318 --> 29:14.053
of staying informed.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.187
We were...
Save it,

29:15.221 --> 29:16.522
Agent Callen.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.858
We know you're angry.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.392
I'm not angry, Agent Hanna--
I'm just disappointed.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.194
The Vietnamese
government

29:22.228 --> 29:26.165
has no record of Hetty
or any of her numerous aliases

29:26.198 --> 29:29.869
entering the country.
Well, actually, we think that
she snuck into the country.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.037
Why?

29:31.070 --> 29:33.940
Why do we think that
or why would

29:33.973 --> 29:34.941
she sneak into
the country?

29:34.974 --> 29:36.843
KENSI: We have reason
to believe that Hetty

29:36.876 --> 29:38.577
came into contact with a
drug runner in the region

29:38.610 --> 29:40.246
who may have smuggled
her into the country.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.014
Again, why?

29:42.048 --> 29:44.083
Whatever Hetty's doing,

29:44.116 --> 29:45.384
it's off the books.
Okay, guys,

29:45.417 --> 29:47.854
one more time with feeling. Why?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.022
We don't know.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.490
We all have vacation
coming our way,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.325
and I know that each of
us would be happy to...

29:53.359 --> 29:55.127
Save it, Agent Callen.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.095
No. Okay?

29:56.128 --> 29:56.863
I'm sorry that you
don't want to hear this

29:56.896 --> 29:57.729
and I'm sorry
you disapprove,

29:57.763 --> 29:59.899
but Hetty's in trouble
and we intend

29:59.932 --> 30:01.033
to help her.
So you can...
G.

30:01.067 --> 30:04.203
...suspend us. You can
fire us if you want...
SAM: G.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.874
We're booked on the next
Air China flight to Vietnam.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.146
Once again, thank you
for your vote of confidence.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.549
But before you go, I suggest
you figure out why she's there.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.152
Otherwise, I doubt
you'll ever find her.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.189
You might want to start
with, um, who took that photo.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.229
DEEKS: So what are the chances
of us taking guns

30:30.262 --> 30:31.497
into the country?
Not a chance.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.999
Well, what if we need weapons?

30:33.032 --> 30:34.100
We improvise.

30:34.133 --> 30:37.236
Yes, and I still would
prefer a gun.
All right,

30:37.269 --> 30:39.105
Billy's hour's up.
We still haven't heard from him.
He's probably using it

30:39.138 --> 30:41.273
to move every speck of
contraband out of his place.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.910
So, I hate to be the voice
of reason, again...

30:43.943 --> 30:45.411
Since when is that a thing?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.379
Well, I am the only girl
in the group, so...

30:47.413 --> 30:49.115
That makes you
the voice of reason?
Obviously.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.183
Objection.
And as such,

30:51.217 --> 30:53.252
I have to agree with
Mosley. All we have

30:53.285 --> 30:56.022
is the bar that Chegwidden
and the others showed up at.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.224
It's a start. We've worked
with a hell of a lot less.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.192
Agreed. But let's look
at what we have.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.394
Hetty cashed out. Why?

31:02.428 --> 31:05.164
She's working off book.
She's dealing in cash.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.533
Everything from fuel for
her boat to paying Tilo Iona

31:07.566 --> 31:09.368
to smuggle her into Vietnam.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.237
Fake papers, bribes...
Agreed.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.972
But all of those things combined
don't come close

31:13.005 --> 31:14.173
to the amount of money
she cashed out.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.942
DEEKS:
Weapons.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.110
She can get ahold of
those any time she wants.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.246
You could finance a small coup
with that amount of cash.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.314
Okay, so what else would she
need millions of dollars for?

31:22.348 --> 31:24.216
Ransom.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.253
Same reason she and the others
accumulated that gold,

31:27.286 --> 31:30.422
only this time she doesn't have
access, forcing her to cash in.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.024
Okay, so who's being ransomed?

31:32.058 --> 31:33.225
DEEKS: Well, it's like
Mosley suggested.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.495
Somebody had to take that
picture of Hetty and the others.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.530
Could have just been a passerby.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.067
Or another person in her unit.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.568
Hetty never mentioned
anyone else.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.635
CALLEN: She never
mentioned any of them

31:43.669 --> 31:45.537
until they bumbled
into one of our cases last year.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.942
Yeah, well, our flight leaves
in three hours and 16 minutes.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.277
Then we got
to run this down fast.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.378
Good luck, gentlemen.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.314
ALLEN:
Batya Corsia,

31:55.347 --> 31:58.985
Alexis Tavori,
Trudy Chambers,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.220
Elizabeth Cohen,
Henrietta Lange.

32:01.253 --> 32:06.125
Are any of these
actually your real name?

32:06.158 --> 32:08.294
No, right?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.929
Let's start
with something simple.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.501
How long did you work
for the CIA

32:15.534 --> 32:17.603
before joining
the Naval Criminal

32:17.636 --> 32:19.638
Investigative Service?

32:20.639 --> 32:24.276
Keane needs medical attention.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.321
I hate this place.

32:35.354 --> 32:39.225
I hate the weather, I hate
the food, I hate the bugs.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.294
Hell, I hate Dang.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.363
I am only here

32:44.396 --> 32:47.233
because of you.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.767
And you have
already kept me here

32:48.800 --> 32:51.603
much longer
than I would have liked.

32:51.637 --> 32:55.541
So feeding Keane
to that tiger

32:55.574 --> 32:58.444
is about the only thing
that I have left

32:58.477 --> 33:00.179
to look forward to.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.113
And the only thing
that would keep me

33:01.147 --> 33:05.384
from doing that is you,
here in this room,

33:05.417 --> 33:07.519
telling me what
I want to know.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.291
Damn, you're good.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.793
You think that
if you stall

33:14.826 --> 33:16.728
long enough,
Keane will bleed out

33:16.762 --> 33:18.397
and succumb to his wounds.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.399
Painful, but...

33:20.432 --> 33:23.102
not nearly as gruesome

33:23.135 --> 33:26.205
as being mauled
to death.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.408
Yeah. No chance.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.443
Dang?!

33:31.477 --> 33:35.547
I joined the CIA

33:35.581 --> 33:37.616
while I was still in college--

33:37.649 --> 33:41.253
uh, December 12, 1963.

33:41.287 --> 33:46.158
It was a cold,
drizzly Thursday.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.308
We found somebody--

34:02.341 --> 34:04.176
a former NIS agent in Vietnam.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.544
He worked with Hetty
and the others?

34:05.577 --> 34:07.546
Nell and Eric are still trying
to confirm that.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.148
Hetty and her crew were
way off the books,

34:09.181 --> 34:10.282
but this guy was there
around the same time.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.318
Where is he?
Hawthorne.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.685
We're running out of time.
Yeah, but I'm driving.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.354
Oh, lucky me.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.669
Hey.
You know,

34:30.702 --> 34:32.238
I could open
that for you

34:32.271 --> 34:34.406
if there's something
you want to take.
Nah.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.575
It's okay. Can't bring weapons
into the country anyway.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.711
That's right.
I forgot.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.681
You know, Hetty once gave me
a makeup brush

34:42.714 --> 34:44.883
with a spring-loaded blade
in it.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.386
Oh, gosh.
And also,

34:47.419 --> 34:50.322
for Christmas, she
made me this scarf

34:50.356 --> 34:52.324
with imbedded Kevlar
in the filaments

34:52.358 --> 34:54.160
so it could double
as a garrote.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.196
She's such a character.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.598
Like the coolest
aunt you ever had.
Yeah.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.569
You know, I kind of wish
I was going with you guys.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.838
I almost wish
I was staying here.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.774
Hmm?

35:08.807 --> 35:11.477
I hate to say it, but
there's a part of me

35:11.510 --> 35:13.845
that doesn't really
want to find her.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.648
I don't...
I don't understand.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.450
No, it's just,

35:18.484 --> 35:20.519
if-if we don't find her,
then there's a good chance

35:20.552 --> 35:22.621
that she's still alive
out there somewhere, you know?

35:22.654 --> 35:26.192
Having mai tais with Granger?

35:26.225 --> 35:29.495
I don't really think
Granger's a mai tai kind of guy.

35:29.528 --> 35:33.499
Well, maybe if it was, you know,
from the skull of his enemy.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.801
That sort of thing.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.472
Hmm. Okay.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.809
No bad mojo.
No. No way.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.511
You're gonna find her.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.179
I know it.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.648
This is Hetty
we're talking about.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.850
She's got more lives than a cat.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.619
Right?

36:02.628 --> 36:05.964
You know,
you're an endangered species.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.770
But I guess
that makes two of us.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.811
This was a long time ago.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.880
Everyone looks so young.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.250
Do you know any of them?
Oh.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.517
Sure do.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.553
I helped support their unit.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.289
Yeah. Uh...

36:30.322 --> 36:32.424
Langston,

36:32.458 --> 36:36.728
Chegwidden, Bridges.

36:36.762 --> 36:40.432
The woman's name was,
uh, uh, Margaret.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.634
I-I forget
her last name.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.471
Yeah. Oh.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.439
Oh, and this guy, Granger--

36:47.473 --> 36:49.841
they pulled him out of the bush,
and he-he stayed

36:49.875 --> 36:51.743
on with them.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.546
Do you know
what their mission was?
No.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.014
They never really, uh,
talked about it.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.650
I... I think they were pulling
spooks out of the jungle.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.919
Did you take this photo?

37:00.952 --> 37:03.021
Uh, no.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.456
You have any idea
who might have?

37:04.490 --> 37:05.624
Yeah.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.026
Probably the kid.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.561
Yeah.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.563
There was this, uh,
this young guy with them.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.599
Nice boy from, uh,

37:13.632 --> 37:16.602
was that Montana
or, uh, Wyoming.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.637
He-he grew up on a,
on a ranch somewhere.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.507
He was pretty green.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.542
Followed the woman around

37:23.575 --> 37:24.843
like a puppy.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.447
Hetty never mentioned anyone.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.716
The kid was, uh, KIA

37:30.749 --> 37:32.618
in a, in a... a chopper crash.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.586
Uh, only the woman survived.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.687
Hmm.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.656
Any chance he
could have survived?

37:37.689 --> 37:38.624
Oh, no, I don't think so.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.025
Pretty sure
they would have looked for him.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.594
And even if he did,
he's probably dead,

37:42.628 --> 37:45.764
or... or dying now
like the rest of us.

37:45.797 --> 37:46.765
What do you mean?

37:46.798 --> 37:50.636
Well, most of the guys
I served with are gone.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.671
I would be, too,

37:52.704 --> 37:55.474
if it weren't
for the lung transplant.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.876
Even so, I'm not sure
how long I got. Hmm.

37:57.909 --> 38:01.046
Agent Orange?
Yeah.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.714
But the NIS were
considered civilians,

38:02.748 --> 38:06.852
so we get no VA benefits.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.054
Bank owns
everything now.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.989
Yeah.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.991
Not that
there's anything left.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.327
Huh.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.563
And, uh, I'm one
of the lucky ones.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.398
Well,

38:19.431 --> 38:22.568
if you can think of anyone else
who might have been around

38:22.601 --> 38:24.536
at that time,
can you call our office?

38:24.570 --> 38:25.771
Of course.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.539
Oh, I-I wish I could do more.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.375
You've done plenty, sir.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.843
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.879
Thank you.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.818
ERIC:
So...

38:39.851 --> 38:42.454
I have not had any luck finding
our mystery photographer.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.356
Everyone we should be
asking is in Vietnam.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.392
Try contacting Sabatino
at the Agency.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.560
He may be able
to help you with a name.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.629
I got to check in
with the assistant director.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.533
Should I be coming with you?
No.

38:54.566 --> 38:55.934
Of course not.
Because we need you here,

38:55.967 --> 38:57.636
doing what you do best.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.504
Plus, somebody's got to

38:58.537 --> 39:00.472
keep this place safe
while I'm gone, huh?

39:00.506 --> 39:02.474
All right. I'll
see what I can do.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.643
Okay.
Oh. Thanks, Sam.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.846
MOSLEY: Enter.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.649
Well...

39:10.682 --> 39:12.584
You're cutting it close, huh?
Yeah, we're out the door.

39:12.618 --> 39:15.687
I just wanted
to say thank you.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.624
Oh, you can save
your apologies, Agent Callen.

39:18.657 --> 39:21.126
I didn't say I was apologizing.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.563
Oh, well, baby steps.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.566
We'll keep you informed
of any progress.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.535
Oh, that would be nice
for a change.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.604
We should get going.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.407
You should.
And good luck.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.676
Thank you.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.853
We good to go?

39:47.886 --> 39:49.521
Yeah.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.022
Let's go get Hetty.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.058
Let's do it.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.502
HETTY:
After the war,

40:03.535 --> 40:06.872
some of us stayed behind
to secure American interests.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.574
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.976
Enough backstory. I'm...

40:11.009 --> 40:13.144
I'm more interested
in current events.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.881
People are so impatient
these days.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.084
You know, we didn't have
computers and cell phones then.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.853
Enough with memory lane.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.691
We did have
some wonderful gadgets, though.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.459
Stop stalling!

40:27.493 --> 40:29.528
Or it's tiger time.
This is important.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.530
Back then,

40:31.563 --> 40:33.999
we understood

40:34.032 --> 40:36.735
the value of information.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.606
The more you knew,
the more valuable you were,

40:40.639 --> 40:43.675
also, the higher
the security risk.

40:43.709 --> 40:47.913
So we took steps
to ensure that

40:47.946 --> 40:51.617
information never fell
into enemy hands.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.853
It's a brave new world.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.123
Yes, but I'm
an old-fashioned girl.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.158
The things we did

41:00.191 --> 41:03.194
back then... were better.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.864
You may think
they were old-fashioned,

41:05.897 --> 41:07.999
but they worked.

41:08.033 --> 41:10.001
Back then,

41:10.035 --> 41:12.037
they'd pull a molar,

41:12.070 --> 41:14.573
replace it with a fake tooth

41:14.606 --> 41:17.576
with a cyanide capsule inside.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.845
You know, in the event

41:19.878 --> 41:23.882
that you were... captured.

41:23.915 --> 41:27.886
That's just...
Cold War folklore.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.921
:
Oh.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.824
I see. Is it?

41:36.928 --> 41:38.830
Open your mouth!

41:38.864 --> 41:39.831
Open it! Open it!
Aah!

41:39.865 --> 41:40.899
Aah!

41:42.834 --> 41:44.870
Aah!

41:44.903 --> 41:46.972
Damn!
