We don't have Taylor Ham?

10:31.551 --> 10:32.655
[Mike]
What do you call it?

10:32.724 --> 10:33.827
Taylor Ham.
It's the best.

10:33.896 --> 10:36.586
Oh, my God.
You mean Pork Roll?

10:36.655 --> 10:39.689
Oh, God.
[Pauly]
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

10:39.758 --> 10:41.000
[laughing]You mean Pork Roll.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.517
Let the debate start.

10:42.586 --> 10:43.655
Taylor Ham.
[Pauly]
Oh!

10:43.724 --> 10:45.344
It's Pork Roll.Oh!

10:45.413 --> 10:47.000
Calm down.
[Pauly]
Ay, ay...

10:47.068 --> 10:48.517
It's Taylor Ham.

10:48.586 --> 10:50.275
[Mike]
There is no such thing.

10:50.344 --> 10:52.931
So there's a very, very,
very important question

10:53.000 --> 10:54.275
when it comes to Jersey Shore:

10:54.344 --> 10:56.275
Is it Taylor Ham
or Pork Roll?

10:56.344 --> 10:58.862
And I'm not taking a side.
I will not do it,

10:58.931 --> 11:01.068
because these people take
this [bleep] serious.

11:01.137 --> 11:04.275
When I go to the store, I say
"Pork Roll, egg, and cheese."

11:04.344 --> 11:06.103
I don't say "Taylor Ham,
egg, and cheese."

11:06.172 --> 11:07.413
Never heard that.

11:07.482 --> 11:08.758
Taylor Ham, egg,
and cheese, yeah.

11:08.827 --> 11:10.344
You really go
to the store and say

11:10.413 --> 11:11.448
"I want a Taylor Ham,
egg, and cheese?"

11:11.517 --> 11:13.310
Yes. Do you want me
to call Jionni?

11:13.379 --> 11:15.034
I've never--
Taylor Ham.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.482
Pork Roll, egg, and cheese.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.586
It sounds-- It just comes off
the tongue really nice.

11:18.655 --> 11:21.310
[Mike]
I don't know what
the [bleep] Taylor Ham is.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.172
When it comes to right
and wrong,

11:23.241 --> 11:25.000
it's definitely not
Taylor Ham.

11:25.068 --> 11:28.103
It's over for you.
Pork Roll.

11:28.172 --> 11:29.689
North Jersey,
they say Taylor Ham.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.137
Ooh...[Mike]
Okay, all right.

11:32.206 --> 11:33.655
It's probably
a North Jersey thing.

11:33.724 --> 11:36.862
The people from Jersey
are divided, okay,

11:36.931 --> 11:39.551
from North Jersey
to South Jersey.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.758
And people from North Jersey
say "Taylor Ham."

11:42.827 --> 11:45.724
And people from
South Jersey say "Pork Roll."

11:45.793 --> 11:47.034
And I say Pork Roll.

11:47.103 --> 11:48.724
Yes--
It says Taylor Ham
on the package.

11:48.793 --> 11:49.896
It doesn't say Pork Roll.

11:49.965 --> 11:51.620
It says Pork Roll
in my areas.

11:51.689 --> 11:52.724
Ew.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.896
Where are you from?
Utah?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.931
I live in Central, okay?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.758
And out here
in these streets...So annoying.

11:58.827 --> 12:00.034
...we say Pork Roll,
egg, and cheese.

12:00.103 --> 12:02.413
It says Taylor Ham
on the package.

12:02.482 --> 12:05.172
No, no, it is Pork Roll.I have to go on the Internet.

12:05.241 --> 12:07.827
I never seen people
so passionate about ham.

12:07.896 --> 12:09.413
It's just ham.

12:09.482 --> 12:11.896
It says Taylor Pork Roll.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.551
You see, there is
no Taylor Ham in here.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.551
It says--
it says Pork Roll.Taylor!

12:15.620 --> 12:17.034
Taylor Pork Roll.Yes.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.000

We both win.

Taylor Ham, Pork Roll,
it's the same [bleep] thing.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.793
and it's in my belly,
that's all I care about.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.275
All right, so we still
didn't solve the debate.

12:27.344 --> 12:28.931
This is like an ongoing thing
that'll never be solved.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.310
Like an unsolved mystery.

12:30.379 --> 12:33.103

18:41.620 --> 18:43.103
Wait, wait, wait, where you
going with the salamis?

18:43.172 --> 18:44.241
Give me a little piece.
Give me a little piece.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.413
Oh, God, Michael.
Which one do you want?

18:45.482 --> 18:47.655
Yeah, a little soppressata.
Okay.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.137
We're really nice,
I promise.

18:49.206 --> 18:51.310
We're just kidnapping Deena.Play it cool.

18:51.379 --> 18:52.896
Don't mind us.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.068
We're all, like, dressed in
in our ski masks and bandanas.

18:56.137 --> 18:58.103
We look like a crazy
Guido gang right now

18:58.172 --> 18:59.758
in the suburbs of New Jersey.

18:59.827 --> 19:01.379
I want this to go smoothly,

19:01.448 --> 19:03.793
but we got a bunch of chooches
in this house, all right?

19:03.862 --> 19:05.275
Hopefully,
nothing goes wrong.

19:05.344 --> 19:08.344
Angelina, go, go.
Red Team, go.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.034
Copy, ringing
the doorbell now.

19:10.103 --> 19:11.448
[Pauly]
We are at the meatball factory.

19:11.517 --> 19:12.793
[walkie-talkie beeping][Angelina]
Going now.

19:14.137 --> 19:15.482
[doorbell rings]

19:15.551 --> 19:17.517
Where do I go?[Nicole]
Move! Get over here!

19:19.068 --> 19:20.482
Go, go, go, go!

19:20.551 --> 19:21.862
Go! Just go!

19:22.896 --> 19:24.344
What the [bleep]?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.000
[all screaming]

19:26.068 --> 19:27.862
You're coming with us.Ma'am, let's go!

19:27.931 --> 19:29.379
Help me!
Come on!

19:29.448 --> 19:31.724
You're coming with us.Get over here.

19:31.793 --> 19:33.034
What the [bleep]?
[laughing]

19:33.103 --> 19:34.344
You are coming with us,

19:34.413 --> 19:35.620
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.344
You are all [bleep] crazy.Come on, girl.

19:37.413 --> 19:41.000
What is happening?
Like, you guys are crazy.

19:41.068 --> 19:42.517
You're coming with us.[Nicole]
Come on.

19:42.586 --> 19:44.586
Someone get the ransom note.Hi.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.931
Why are you always dressed
like a creep?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.275
They are just so dramatic.

19:48.344 --> 19:51.379
Like, dressing up
like frickin' crazies.

19:51.448 --> 19:54.068
I'm, like, I can't.
And Vinny with the stocking.

19:54.137 --> 19:56.172
They're so stupid.

19:56.241 --> 19:57.344
Oh, my God.It's a beautiful,

19:57.413 --> 19:58.724
beautiful, beautiful house.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.275
And it's so clean.
And you have your own room.

20:00.344 --> 20:01.931
It's beautiful.You have a really nice room,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.482
really nice bathroom,
spotless.

20:03.551 --> 20:05.724
And you said it's close,
so if I don't feel good...

20:05.793 --> 20:06.862
We're gonna take you
right homes.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.448
It's not even that far.Okay.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.137
[all cheering]

20:11.206 --> 20:12.655
[Nicole]
Yay! We kidnapped her.

20:12.724 --> 20:15.655
The kidnapping worked.
Deena's coming with us.

20:15.724 --> 20:18.379
Thank God. It's like,
I need my meatball.

20:18.448 --> 20:20.206
Did anybody do sex in my bed?

20:20.275 --> 20:21.517
[Pauly]
Nobody touched your bed.

20:21.586 --> 20:22.724
[crosstalk]

20:22.793 --> 20:24.413
No, Ronnie almost did
last night, but no.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.620
You have your--
Can you not ruin this?

20:26.689 --> 20:28.620
Yeah, why is he not--
What happened?

20:28.689 --> 20:30.172
He's supposedly
single now.

20:30.241 --> 20:33.034
My girlfriend came out
last night, and then, boom.

20:33.103 --> 20:36.172
It was-- They were in
the Jacuzzi together,
like, alone.

20:36.241 --> 20:38.241
What is he?
A [bleep] moron?

20:38.310 --> 20:40.862
It's wild.
No, it's bad.I don't get it.

20:40.931 --> 20:42.517
She's still the mother
of your kid, let it
chill for a minute.

20:42.586 --> 20:44.758
If you're gonna break up,
do it civilly.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.034
And you don't need
to rush into a girl,

20:46.103 --> 20:47.241
like the first time
you've seen [bleep].

20:47.310 --> 20:48.827
[laughter]You understand?

20:48.896 --> 20:51.172
There's a baby here.

20:51.241 --> 20:53.413
He's about to see [bleep]
for the first time.

20:53.482 --> 20:55.103
Oh, my-- Deener![all laughing]

20:55.172 --> 20:57.965
Stop packing my bag.

20:58.034 --> 21:00.655
[Deena]
Like, what goes on
in Ron's life?

21:00.724 --> 21:03.482
I don't know if I can handle
all this drama sober.

21:03.551 --> 21:05.034
We have packed
the bag, Deeners.

21:05.103 --> 21:07.586
We're ready to go.How many weeks
are we now?

21:07.655 --> 21:09.172
Uh, 18.

21:09.241 --> 21:10.448
[Nicole]
I love how you popped.

21:10.517 --> 21:13.034
Hey, you and Mike got
the same stomach now.

21:13.103 --> 21:15.310
[all]

Ooh, pretty.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.103
Now this is a house.[Nicole]
We're fancy.

21:34.172 --> 21:35.379
It's a house.

21:35.448 --> 21:38.000
Oh, it's so pretty.
Nicest house we've had.

21:38.068 --> 21:39.517
Oh, yes.
I like it.

21:39.586 --> 21:40.689
This is our chair.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.551
Deena, welcome to our home.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.344
Kinda smells garbagy
in here though.

21:44.413 --> 21:45.655
Eh...

21:45.724 --> 21:47.344
You can smell everything.

21:47.413 --> 21:48.655
I have a sensitive nose.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.758
I can smell things,
like, for miles away.

21:50.827 --> 21:54.344
This house smells like garbage.
Definitely a shore house.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.379
You're the room that says
"Meatball On Board."

21:56.448 --> 21:57.758
Oh, I love it.

21:57.827 --> 21:59.034
[Pauly]
Get it? Cause you have
a meatball on board.

21:59.103 --> 22:00.724
Did you get the sign?Yeah.

22:00.793 --> 22:02.620
Oh, very nice.Do you like it?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.137
No, I love it.

22:04.206 --> 22:06.517
Do you feel comfortable?Yes, I do.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.482
And I love it.
They have, like, a little
"Meatball On Board" sign.

22:09.551 --> 22:12.896
I have, like, this cute little
room with my own bathroom.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.137
And they made sure no one
was coming into my room

22:15.206 --> 22:17.241
while I wasn't here,
and it's just sweet.

22:17.310 --> 22:19.068
It just means a lot to me,
and I love it.

22:19.137 --> 22:22.068
Oh, Ron's sleeping?
Hi, Ron.

22:25.724 --> 22:28.137
Is he alive?
[Nicole]
Oh, my God.

22:28.206 --> 22:29.482
Is he alive?He's still sleeping.

22:29.551 --> 22:32.000
He's still sleeping.
Check if he's breathing.

22:32.068 --> 22:34.034
[Jenni]
What is on his pillow?

22:39.241 --> 22:40.655
Do you wanna get up?

22:40.724 --> 22:41.931
[Jenni]
Deena's here.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.965
It's 6:30.

22:44.034 --> 22:46.965
Ron's still sleeping.
He's not saying a word.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.655
Dude, Deena's here.
Get your [bleep] together.

22:51.724 --> 22:53.793
Yeah? It's crazy.

22:53.862 --> 22:55.931
We don't know how to handle
Ronnie right now.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.206
We've all given him our all.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.758
I tried a little bit
of tough love.

22:59.827 --> 23:01.448
I tried talking [bleep]
to him.

23:01.517 --> 23:04.000
Like, it didn't work.
I don't know all the answers.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.137
I can sit back and tell him
what I think he should do

23:06.206 --> 23:08.448
but he just doesn't absorb
any kind of advice.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.275
[Vinny]
Did anyone tap him?
Is he alive?

23:10.344 --> 23:11.896
[Angelina]
He's drooling on his pillow.Yeah.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.862
I said hi, he didn't hear me,
I don't think.

23:13.931 --> 23:16.896
[Angelina]
This roller-coaster
of Ronnie's is just terrible.

23:16.965 --> 23:18.689
You know, it's like
he doesn't wanna wake up

23:18.758 --> 23:20.793
from this nightmare
it almost seems like.

23:23.551 --> 23:25.482
[Ronnie coughs][Angelina]
Oh, my God.

23:25.551 --> 23:29.034
This relationship with Jen right
now is making Ron really sick.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.793
[Jenni whispering]
He's still in bed.

23:30.862 --> 23:32.758
Oh, that's not right.

23:32.827 --> 23:34.482
[Nicole]
We don't know
what to do right now.

23:34.551 --> 23:35.758
It's like, "Hello,
are you alive?"

23:35.827 --> 23:36.931
Like, I don't know
what's going on.

Yass! We're going
Italian, Osteria.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.275
Oh, my God!
I love that place.

24:02.344 --> 24:03.655
[Mike]
We love that place, yes.

24:03.724 --> 24:07.620
Osteria is one of the nicest
places in the area

24:07.689 --> 24:11.862
to do a little Italian
fine dining situation.

24:15.068 --> 24:16.862
Yo, fam.
Mm?

Thank you.All right, no problem.

I need to just lay down,
regroup, recharge,

24:33.827 --> 24:35.448
and go through my own process.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.068
I love the help that
I'm getting from my roommates,

24:38.137 --> 24:41.482
but I do like to go through
my things in my own way.

24:41.551 --> 24:43.965
You know, some people wanna go
out and laugh and joke.

24:44.034 --> 24:46.655
Me, I'd rather
get in my own feelings,

24:46.724 --> 24:48.689
make a decision,
and that's it.

Heh!

25:07.620 --> 25:08.896
Yeah, she's moving in with me.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.379
[Angelina]
My grandmother is psychic.

25:10.448 --> 25:11.655
Do you know
what she said to me?

25:11.724 --> 25:15.793
"I'm sensing somebody is
in talks for a divorce."

25:15.862 --> 25:17.586
What'd she say?

25:17.655 --> 25:19.620
She sees in the future

25:19.689 --> 25:21.482
Jenni and Roger
getting divorced.

25:23.896 --> 25:25.137
Well, I mean,
I always talk about it.

25:25.206 --> 25:26.965
Nicole always talks about it...

25:27.034 --> 25:29.000

Yeah, but like even just
talking about it a little bit,

25:29.068 --> 25:31.931
my grandmother, like, knew,
isn't that crazy?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.413
I don't understand what's going
on between her and Roger,

25:34.482 --> 25:36.862
but to be honest with you,
I don't hear her talking

25:36.931 --> 25:38.172
about Roger that much.

25:38.241 --> 25:40.137
I don't know what the future
holds for her.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.931
But, I mean, look,
my grandmother is a psychic,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.172
and she knows what the hell
the future holds.

25:45.241 --> 25:47.034

25:48.620 --> 25:51.448
That's what I'm saying.
Like, welcome to relationships.

Yeah.

I'm mentally just drained.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.275
Well, you're gonna
have to eat.

34:59.344 --> 35:02.793
I brought you some pastas,
some really good pastas.

35:02.862 --> 35:04.965
You know what I mean?
Some good comfort food.

35:05.034 --> 35:07.137
[Ronnie]
Yeah, I probably should eat,
but I don't want to.

35:07.206 --> 35:10.827
I just, like, feel like
I'm not hungry, I'm not happy,

35:10.896 --> 35:12.482
I'm not sad.
I'm just, like, numb.

35:12.551 --> 35:14.034
I'm gonna get up in a minute.

35:14.103 --> 35:16.724
Okay.I'll be right down.

35:16.793 --> 35:18.482
This whole situation with Ron
is just [bleep].

35:18.551 --> 35:20.413
Ron and Jen,
they're both toxic,

35:20.482 --> 35:22.586
and, you know,
we wanna be there for him,

35:22.655 --> 35:25.103
but we don't know
what to do right now.

35:25.172 --> 35:26.413
He should eat.

35:26.482 --> 35:27.724
We should heat up
that food for him.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.103
[Ronnie coughing]

35:30.862 --> 35:32.000

[Angelina]
Oh, my God.

35:36.413 --> 35:38.034
[whispering]
He's [bleep] still in bed.

35:38.103 --> 35:41.068
No. Still?

35:41.137 --> 35:43.827
He's like,
"I'm getting up now."

35:43.896 --> 35:45.000
He's getting up now?Getting up now?

35:45.068 --> 35:46.758
For what?
I'm going to bed.

35:46.827 --> 35:48.586
So, the way Ronnie's acting
right now, he's depressed,

35:48.655 --> 35:51.310
and I don't know how to fix
Ronnie's moods at all anymore.

35:51.379 --> 35:53.689

him back to his old self...
