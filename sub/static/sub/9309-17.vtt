01:05.773 --> 01:07.540
Morning!

01:07.575 --> 01:08.774
Hi.
[door closes]

01:08.810 --> 01:10.543
Perfect timing. I'm done packing.

01:10.578 --> 01:12.745
Professor Sullivan
just e-mailed me

01:12.780 --> 01:16.115
that the keys are under the mat,
and the place is all yours.

01:16.150 --> 01:19.852
- Well, thank you for setting this up.
- Of course.

01:19.887 --> 01:22.588
Is this all you're taking?

01:22.624 --> 01:27.860
Yeah.
No! Wait! And this.

01:27.895 --> 01:30.963
- He's coming, too.
- Do you really need it?

01:30.999 --> 01:35.134
- Um, it just seems a little dead.
- He's not dead.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.136
Dead-ish.

01:37.171 --> 01:39.639
Don't say that.
He can hear you.

01:39.674 --> 01:41.107
Don't listen to her.

01:41.142 --> 01:45.011
We could always get you
a new cactus or a nice fern.

01:45.046 --> 01:50.149
I don't want a new cactus.
I like this one.

01:50.184 --> 01:54.387
- He's a survivor.
- Ah. It came out of the fire.

01:54.422 --> 01:55.755
Yeah.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.857
He might be a little charred,

01:57.892 --> 02:01.394
but, you know, he's still
got some sharp-ass thorns.

02:01.429 --> 02:03.057
Spines I think they're called.

02:03.831 --> 02:05.665
I... like the metaphor.

02:05.700 --> 02:11.671
Well, we'll put it on
the best ledge in the house.

02:11.706 --> 02:14.206
Thank you.

02:16.444 --> 02:18.678
All right!
Okay ... oh!

02:18.713 --> 02:22.014
- Can you just wait until I'm gone?
- I've been waiting.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.616
Are you even sad
that I'm moving out?

02:23.651 --> 02:25.117
Nope.
I'm a grown man.

02:25.153 --> 02:27.620
If I'm gonna have a second
toothbrush by my bathroom sink,

02:27.655 --> 02:30.956
I don't want it to be my sister's.
So, bye-bye.

02:30.992 --> 02:33.559
Okay, don't blame your lack
of a love life on me, okay?

02:33.594 --> 02:35.695
I don't make you wear
those baseball pajamas.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.430
Ma got me those.

02:37.465 --> 02:39.498
Good luck explaining that
to toothbrush number two.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.433
[door opens]
Hmm.

02:40.468 --> 02:42.501
Thanks for taking me in.

02:44.005 --> 02:45.705
I love you.

<b>6x17 - "Bomb Voyage"</b>

03:07.495 --> 03:08.828
She's our hacker's cousin?

03:08.896 --> 03:10.796
<i>Nina: Yes.
Married name's Hearn,</i>

03:10.832 --> 03:12.998
not Keating, which is why we
didn't trip to her earlier.

03:13.034 --> 03:15.501
She did three years at
Framingham for check kiting,

03:15.536 --> 03:18.070
was released six months ago.
That's how I found her.

03:18.106 --> 03:19.638
Our hacker
was in a tagged photo

03:19.674 --> 03:21.107
at Rhonda's
welcome-home party.

03:21.142 --> 03:22.875
Are we sure
she's linked to Joe Harris?

03:22.910 --> 03:24.610
<i>No, but she's in jail</i>

03:24.645 --> 03:26.178
with our arsonist
and Maura's kidnapper.

03:26.214 --> 03:27.747
That's a lot of coincidental
string to hold them together.

03:27.782 --> 03:31.884
- Well, let's bring her in.
- I thought you might say that.

03:31.919 --> 03:35.154
But her parole officer seems
to have... misplaced her.

03:35.189 --> 03:38.824
- Since when?
- No contact for three months.

03:38.860 --> 03:43.635
- Well, let's find her fast.
- Will do. [cellphone beeps]

03:44.198 --> 03:46.599
[keyboard keys clacking]

03:49.737 --> 03:52.772
This spoils my experience of nature.

03:52.807 --> 03:56.008
- You hate nature.
- Well, I would like it a lot more

03:56.043 --> 03:57.877
if there were fewer
dead people in it.

03:57.912 --> 04:00.646
- Where's the victim?
- Well, this case involves a hike.

04:00.681 --> 04:01.647
[groans]

04:01.682 --> 04:02.982
- Do I need my boots?
- Yep.

04:04.318 --> 04:06.786
911 got a call about
an explosion this morning.

04:06.821 --> 04:09.588
By the time the unit got here,
jogger had found a finger.

04:13.694 --> 04:15.060
Where?

04:15.096 --> 04:16.728
It fell out of a tree
right in front of him.

04:19.834 --> 04:23.736
- This is not an evidence bag.
- No. Sandwich bag.

04:23.771 --> 04:26.305
Jogger didn't want a critter to
carry off with a partial digit.

04:26.340 --> 04:29.675
Very considerate. Though my
evidence now has granola on it.

04:30.978 --> 04:33.179
Kid tested, mother approved.

04:35.683 --> 04:39.218
Was our victim prone to playing
with explosives in the woods?

04:39.253 --> 04:41.687
I haven't been up to the scene yet,
so I'm a little short of details.

04:41.722 --> 04:42.955
[sighs]

04:42.990 --> 04:44.190
Which way?

04:47.261 --> 04:49.094
What? What else?

04:49.130 --> 04:51.230
Your hacker had a relative
that did time at MCI Framingham.

04:51.265 --> 04:55.067
- Rhonda Hearn?
- No, doesn't ring any bells.

04:55.102 --> 04:57.803
Still, maybe we're closer to
figuring out who's behind all this.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.706
Your lips to god's ears.

05:00.741 --> 05:04.523
[music]

05:04.846 --> 05:07.346
Okay, so, powdered sand
and ivory dream

05:07.381 --> 05:11.150
- are the exact same color, right?
- Different texture.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.318
[chuckles]

05:12.353 --> 05:14.119
We're talking about table linens.

05:14.155 --> 05:16.021
Can it really be that complicated?

05:16.057 --> 05:18.090
[chuckles] Wait till you get
to the centerpiece.

05:18.125 --> 05:23.262
You have to be a horticulturist
to figure that all out. [groans]

05:23.297 --> 05:25.831
[sighs]

05:25.867 --> 05:28.734
- All right, what's wrong with you?
- Oh, no, I'm just thinking.

05:28.769 --> 05:30.303
You know, I mean, this isn't
Vince's first wedding.

05:30.338 --> 05:33.105
- It's not even his second.
- Yeah? So?

05:33.140 --> 05:35.741
So, maybe I'm getting
a little carried away.

05:35.776 --> 05:36.876
It's your wedding day.

05:36.911 --> 05:40.179
- You're supposed to get carried away.
- Really?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.748
You're the bride.
Embrace it ... all of it.

05:42.783 --> 05:47.753
- Yeah, the linens, the flowers.
- The dress! [cellphone ringing]

05:47.788 --> 05:50.122
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. [cellphone beeps]

05:50.157 --> 05:51.123
Hi, Ron.

05:52.827 --> 05:54.126
What?

05:56.297 --> 05:58.664
Yeah, well, I don't know what to say.

05:58.699 --> 06:00.165
Can I call you right back?

06:00.201 --> 06:02.902
Yeah. Yep.
Right back. Bye.

06:02.937 --> 06:04.036
[cellphone beeps]

06:04.071 --> 06:05.771
Is everything okay?

06:05.806 --> 06:10.209
Ron was invited to a medical
conference in Paris this weekend.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.279
He asked if my passport was in order.

06:13.314 --> 06:18.317
- So he wants to take you to Paris.
- That's impossible, right?

06:18.352 --> 06:20.319
[chuckling] Okay, okay.

06:20.354 --> 06:22.922
I'm gonna give your advice
back to you.

06:22.957 --> 06:27.092
Go for it.
Call him back. Say yes.

06:27.128 --> 06:27.993
<i>Say "oui."</i>

06:29.029 --> 06:30.896
No.

06:31.966 --> 06:33.966
[music]

06:37.271 --> 06:41.073
It appears the cause of death
was traumatic limb loss.

06:41.108 --> 06:42.341
No!

06:42.376 --> 06:45.010
We're gonna need
more evidence bags.

06:47.114 --> 06:49.782
Not a huge charge.
Smaller than a grenade.

06:49.817 --> 06:53.319
Yeah. Like a homemade
pipe bomb, you think?

06:53.354 --> 06:57.022
<i>Did the uniforms find any other bombs</i>

06:57.058 --> 07:02.061
- or bomb-making materials?
- No, just a bag of carrots.

07:02.096 --> 07:04.196
Okay, well, I'll reach out
to the bomb squad.

07:04.231 --> 07:06.465
They're gonna want to find
the other pieces of the device,

07:06.500 --> 07:08.100
make sure it's fully detonated.

07:08.135 --> 07:11.704
The shrapnel density
and gunpowder residue

07:11.739 --> 07:14.239
- suggests it might have ...
- Stop!

07:14.275 --> 07:15.941
How could you disagree
with me, sergeant?

07:15.977 --> 07:16.942
- I haven't ev...
- Just stop.

07:18.746 --> 07:20.980
There's half a possum and
another crater over there.

07:21.015 --> 07:24.183
We're standing in a minefield.
Just don't move.

07:24.218 --> 07:26.986
[music]

07:34.737 --> 07:35.903
<i>[over PA] Hello, detectives. </i>

07:35.971 --> 07:37.905

07:37.940 --> 07:40.774
Okay, Bryce, you going for,
like, a pep-rally thing?

07:40.810 --> 07:44.478
'Cause not peppy.
Not peppy.

07:44.513 --> 07:46.513
<i>I can shout if that'd
be easier for you,</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:48.515

07:48.551 --> 07:51.552
Okay, listen up, first off,

07:51.587 --> 07:55.055
obviously, you're all
gonna stay where you are.

07:55.090 --> 07:57.090
<i>Please turn off your cellphones.</i>

07:57.126 --> 08:00.961
<i>It is unlikely that a bomb of
this type was detonated remotely,</i>

08:00.996 --> 08:03.697
<i>but we do not know what else
was planted here.</i>

08:03.732 --> 08:07.000
<i>Our plan is to use the
metal detectors and the dogs</i>

08:07.036 --> 08:09.903
to clear safe pathways
to walk you out,

08:09.939 --> 08:12.873
but it will take a while.

08:12.908 --> 08:15.676
We can only clear three inches
at a time.

08:15.711 --> 08:18.479
You know what?
Go back to the bullhorn.

08:18.514 --> 08:21.148
'Cause what you're saying
is excruciating.

08:21.183 --> 08:23.016
Hey, you know,
I'm in a nice, shady spot,

08:23.052 --> 08:24.751

Wha... I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

08:26.655 --> 08:28.856

He's right.</i>

08:28.891 --> 08:30.491
<i>You're all clustered together.</i>

08:30.526 --> 08:32.092
<i>He's separate.
It's more efficient.</i>

08:32.126 --> 08:34.227
Is everybody clear?

08:34.263 --> 08:36.897
- Got it.
- Yeah.

08:36.932 --> 08:38.631
Why is it when you can't use
the ladies room,

08:38.667 --> 08:40.671
all you want to do is use
the ladies room?

08:42.938 --> 08:46.418

We're all good.

[music]

08:56.986 --> 08:58.118
Hey.

09:00.089 --> 09:04.925
- You never called back about Paris.
- I'm sorry. Yeah.

09:04.960 --> 09:10.664
I, uh... I know you
need to book the tickets.

09:10.699 --> 09:12.666
I'm still thinking.

09:12.701 --> 09:15.602
[sighs]
I'm moving too fast.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.571
I-I got swept up,

09:17.606 --> 09:20.040
and I-I pushed for something
that you're not ready for.

09:20.075 --> 09:21.675
No, no, that's not it.

09:21.710 --> 09:24.144
I would love to go away with you.

09:24.179 --> 09:28.882
- You would?
- Yeah. But, um...

09:28.918 --> 09:34.588
dropping everything
and jetting off to Europe...

09:34.623 --> 09:37.691
I don't know why, but...

09:37.726 --> 09:40.894
it's hard for me
imagining myself

09:40.930 --> 09:44.932
getting carried away like that.

09:44.967 --> 09:48.802
- I know why.
- You do?

09:48.837 --> 09:50.837
How can you get carried away

09:50.873 --> 09:54.107
when you're always so busy
carrying everyone else?

09:54.143 --> 09:57.778
Yeah.
Maybe.

09:59.248 --> 10:03.817
I don't want to pressure you,
but... I think you'd love Paris.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.792
I'll see you when I get back.

10:13.762 --> 10:14.995
Okay.

10:15.731 --> 10:16.964
[beeping]

10:16.999 --> 10:20.267
Is it possible whoever
planted these things

10:20.302 --> 10:22.102
had no particular target in mind?

10:22.137 --> 10:25.872
- Well, it's a really remote location.
- Right? [music]

10:25.908 --> 10:28.609
Like, maybe he was practicing.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.344
You know, maybe he was gonna
plant them elsewhere.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.847
Well, that would fit the
distribution of the explosive residue.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.616
Primarily on the front
of his torso,

10:35.651 --> 10:37.902
But there's more on the upper
torso, perhaps indicating

10:37.903 --> 10:40.928
that he was looking down
at the time of detonation.

10:42.057 --> 10:44.024
- Hey.
- Yeah.

10:44.059 --> 10:45.759
Well, we should check
with homeland security

10:45.794 --> 10:47.928
and FBI and see if they've got
any home-grown terrorists

10:47.963 --> 10:50.271
on their radar in the area, you know?

10:51.066 --> 10:54.001
You're clear, Dr. Isles.
Remain inside the flags as you exit.

10:54.036 --> 10:57.304
Okay. I will need a CSRU tech
to help me with the body.

10:57.339 --> 10:59.172
I'm sorry.
First priority's for the living.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.308
The body will be retrieved
when we clear the field.

11:01.343 --> 11:03.076
But he's in the sun.

11:03.112 --> 11:05.312
There will be a cascade
of chemical reactions

11:05.347 --> 11:07.047
that will affect my analysis.

11:07.082 --> 11:09.182
And I don't have any photos
or samples.

11:09.218 --> 11:10.684
And what if something blows up?

11:10.719 --> 11:13.120
- I'll be unable to help ...
- We'll get this done as quickly as we can.

11:13.155 --> 11:18.375
I wish somebody had mentioned the
living/dead priority thing earlier.

11:20.429 --> 11:25.098
Hold this, please.
You're not squeamish, are you?

11:25.134 --> 11:28.135
Oh, for Chr... he's standing
in front of half a man!

11:28.170 --> 11:30.203
If he was squeamish,
we would know about it.

11:30.239 --> 11:32.053
I'm very sorry.

11:33.308 --> 11:35.776
Well, this is no way
to run an investigation.

11:35.811 --> 11:39.429
I'll try harder next time.

11:40.215 --> 11:43.341
[music]

11:52.161 --> 11:54.828
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:54.863 --> 11:57.330
I'm warm, annoyed,
but I'm ... I'm fine.

11:57.366 --> 12:01.068
- You were in a minefield.
- And Jane and Korsak are still there.

12:01.103 --> 12:03.236
And right now we can help most
by solving this

12:03.272 --> 12:05.939
and ensuring that whoever did it
can't hurt anybody else.

12:05.974 --> 12:08.175
This is from our victim.
Run a tox screen.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.976
If he built the bomb himself,

12:10.012 --> 12:12.345
he may have traces of
2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene

12:12.381 --> 12:15.382
in his bloodstream from
inhalation or physical contact.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.217
- Maura!
- Oh.

12:17.252 --> 12:18.985
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Thank you.

12:19.021 --> 12:20.387
- Yeah.
- Thank you for your concern.

12:20.422 --> 12:21.888
Thank you both for your concern.
But I'm fine.

12:21.924 --> 12:23.724
All right.

12:23.759 --> 12:26.760
All right, so, based on the photos

12:26.795 --> 12:29.796
I took of the fingerprints,
our victim is John Franklin.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.617
He is a co-founder of an NGO
that specializes in de-mining

12:32.618 --> 12:35.402
former war zones and making
them safe for civilians.

12:35.437 --> 12:37.871
Well, that would explain how
he might get a land mine.

12:37.906 --> 12:39.206
Yeah, but it doesn't explain

12:39.241 --> 12:41.853
why he would blow himself
up in a park in Boston.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.780
[beeping]

12:51.854 --> 12:53.220
You're clear.

12:53.255 --> 12:54.955
Just stay on the path
on the way out, okay?

12:54.990 --> 12:58.525
- Okay, uh, when can he go?
- Oh, don't worry about me, Jane.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.293
Kiki will be glad I missed a meal.

13:00.329 --> 13:01.428
[rapid beeping]

13:01.463 --> 13:04.064
- I've got something!
- Hang on a second.

13:08.070 --> 13:09.269
[device beeps]

13:09.304 --> 13:10.137
Contact.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.543
[device beeps]

13:16.578 --> 13:18.611
We've got another device.

13:19.314 --> 13:21.414
Don't move until he's flagged it.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.584
We don't want any motion
in the area while he's working.

13:34.129 --> 13:37.864
<i>Mr. Park, how long have you
and John been doing this work?</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:41.535
10 years. We joined the
peace corps after college.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.870
Saw the damage the mines can do.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.039
Decided to do something about it.

13:46.074 --> 13:49.442
The way John was killed seems
very specific to your work.

13:49.478 --> 13:52.412
- Does your NGO have any enemies?
- Plenty.

13:52.447 --> 13:55.148
Governments of countries
who don't want us there,

13:55.184 --> 13:57.350
people who think
we could be doing more.

13:57.386 --> 13:59.052
John took most of the heat for it.

13:59.087 --> 14:00.754
He was the face of our organization.

14:00.789 --> 14:03.290
Fundraising, government
relations, that kind of thing?

14:03.325 --> 14:05.859
Yeah.
Yeah, he was great at it.

14:05.894 --> 14:07.327
[cellphone vibrates]
[sighs]

14:12.501 --> 14:14.968
Our bomb squad just found
another mine.

14:15.003 --> 14:18.271
- What? Where?
- In the same place.

14:18.307 --> 14:21.308
Whoever did this was determined
to take him out.

14:21.343 --> 14:24.411
Can I help?
I'm an expert in de-mining.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.146
I-I appreciate the offer,

14:26.181 --> 14:28.982
but what would really help is
to figure out who killed him.

14:29.017 --> 14:31.518
Can you put together a list
of the places you've worked,

14:31.553 --> 14:33.987
uh, copies of his e-mails,
employee records?

14:34.022 --> 14:37.057
- Of course.
- Anyone with a grudge against you

14:37.092 --> 14:39.792
is a potential suspect now, all right?

14:43.398 --> 14:45.031
[beeping]

14:48.203 --> 14:51.872
<i>Bryce: Okay, Jane, mine's flagged.
You can go now.</i>

14:51.907 --> 14:53.506
Um, okay.
I'm ... I'm ...

14:53.542 --> 14:55.041
I'm just gonna wait for you
over here, okay?

14:55.077 --> 14:56.443
Oh, don't be silly.
It's a million degrees.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.978
Get in the shade.
Get some water.

14:58.013 --> 14:59.613
I-It's fine.
I don't mind waiting.

14:59.648 --> 15:03.016
Would you get me a pizza ...
sausage and onion?

15:03.051 --> 15:04.484
Really?

15:05.053 --> 15:09.355
Okay. I'll get it in one of
those sleeves, keep it extra hot.

15:15.530 --> 15:18.040
Don't get any closer.

15:18.567 --> 15:21.034
I'm not sure it's safe. I...

15:21.069 --> 15:24.004
- I stepped on one.
- I'm standing on a land mine.

15:24.039 --> 15:27.140
[tense music]

15:35.946 --> 15:38.814
Normally, you step on a mine,
it explodes within seconds,

15:38.849 --> 15:40.716
but we think that Korsak
stepped on the edge of it

15:40.751 --> 15:42.484
and it rocked up and
that's how he saw it.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.953
Well, if it didn't explode,
can you just step off of it?

15:44.989 --> 15:47.056
We can't risk it rocking back into place

15:47.091 --> 15:48.991
and activating the pressure plate.

15:49.026 --> 15:51.827
Well, how are you
gonna get him off of it?

15:51.862 --> 15:54.663
[sighs]

15:54.698 --> 15:57.766
- We're not sure yet.
- Okay.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.935
- Where are you going?
- To go sit with him!

15:59.970 --> 16:03.472
No, Jane, you got to stay outside
the potential blast zone.

16:03.507 --> 16:05.908
Let me explain something to you.

16:05.943 --> 16:08.544
That is one of the finest
detectives I have ever known,

16:08.579 --> 16:11.046
and he is standing out there alone,

16:11.082 --> 16:13.348
waiting to see if he's gonna blow up.

16:14.752 --> 16:16.452
I'm going.

16:18.556 --> 16:20.489
[sighs]

16:31.702 --> 16:34.803
Kent, I need you to go up
to the bombing site.

16:34.839 --> 16:36.538
Sure.

16:36.574 --> 16:38.407
How many technicians
do you want me to take?

16:38.442 --> 16:40.042
None.
Just your medical bag.

16:41.512 --> 16:44.546
Sergeant Korsak is standing
on a land mine.

16:44.582 --> 16:46.482
I think your experiences
in Afghanistan

16:46.517 --> 16:50.486
have made you uniquely qualified
to help if things...

16:50.521 --> 16:55.924
- Go sideways. Yeah.
- I have one thing I have to do,

16:55.960 --> 16:58.660
but I will be there as soon as I can.

16:58.696 --> 17:00.095
Okay.

17:07.037 --> 17:09.838
<i>[bullhorn crackles]
Close enough, Jane.</i>

17:17.915 --> 17:21.116
<i>Jane, I mean it.
Stop.</i>

17:23.020 --> 17:26.722
- Apparently, this is close enough.
- You look ridiculous.

17:26.757 --> 17:28.457
Shouldn't you be out
catching a murderer?

17:28.492 --> 17:29.625
You want me
to go back to work?

17:29.660 --> 17:32.494
You walk over here and make me.
[laughs]

17:33.831 --> 17:34.863
[bullhorn crackles]

17:35.900 --> 17:36.798
[bullhorn crackles]

17:38.636 --> 17:42.004
Apparently, our victim
came up here a lot.

17:42.039 --> 17:45.240
So someone planted enough mines
he'd step on one eventually.

17:45.276 --> 17:48.510
- Yeah.
- If you're patient,

17:48.546 --> 17:50.779
it's not a stupid way
to murder someone.

17:50.814 --> 17:52.714
No stupider than any other way.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.583
Yeah.

17:54.618 --> 17:57.619
You know, I've developed
a new appreciation

17:57.655 --> 18:00.956
- to what you've been going through.
- What do you mean?

18:00.991 --> 18:02.791
Not to go too deep
with the metaphor,

18:02.826 --> 18:05.594
but the thought of your life
being blown up by unseen forces.

18:05.629 --> 18:07.162
Yeah, no, that ...
that's too deep. [chuckles]

18:07.198 --> 18:10.566
Are you sure you're dealing
with it all okay?

18:10.601 --> 18:13.802
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:15.906 --> 18:18.273
[voice breaking]
'Cause I'm a little shaky.

18:19.677 --> 18:23.178
Thinking how...
life with Kiki's so great.

18:23.214 --> 18:25.914
It can all be gone in an instant.

18:28.285 --> 18:30.852
And I've only been out here
a couple hours.

18:30.888 --> 18:33.021
Nothi...

18:34.123 --> 18:37.259
Nothing is gonna happen
to you, okay?

18:37.294 --> 18:39.161
I'm not gonna let it.

18:39.196 --> 18:41.129
And I ... and I got pizza
standing by.

18:41.165 --> 18:44.066
[chuckles]
Okay?

18:44.101 --> 18:49.004
How's the ...
how's the wedding planning?

18:49.039 --> 18:50.939
Since you brought it up,

18:50.975 --> 18:52.307
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

18:54.311 --> 18:56.878
You want to be my best man...
so to speak?

18:59.683 --> 19:02.684
Well, do I have to...
throw you a-a bachelor party?

19:02.720 --> 19:04.820
'Cause I'm in for poker.

19:04.855 --> 19:06.788
You know, not so much
on the strippers.

19:06.824 --> 19:09.057
What's going on?

19:13.864 --> 19:15.998
Um...

19:16.033 --> 19:18.767
They're gonna ... they're gonna
remove that bomb.

19:18.802 --> 19:21.003
So...

19:24.642 --> 19:26.675
I'm too old for a bachelor party.

19:28.746 --> 19:33.615
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

19:36.887 --> 19:40.386
I'd be honored
to be your best man.

19:43.761 --> 19:45.260
[sighs]

19:51.302 --> 19:53.302
Who gets angry at people
for removing mines?

19:53.337 --> 19:55.837
Well, there's millions of mines
all around the world.

19:55.873 --> 19:57.906
And a lot of governments
don't want Americans

19:57.941 --> 19:59.374
coming in and digging them up.

19:59.410 --> 20:02.344
So if someone flew here
to send that message...

20:02.379 --> 20:05.747
Or they were here already,
in an embassy, maybe.

20:05.783 --> 20:06.882
Maybe.

20:08.919 --> 20:12.054
Keep sorting through the e-mails.
See if anyone sounds like

20:12.089 --> 20:12.888
they're gonna take things
a step further.

20:12.923 --> 20:16.291
Hey.
How's Jane's case coming?

20:16.327 --> 20:18.827
Any luck finding the hacker's cousin?

20:18.862 --> 20:21.029
She was living in a residential
hotel until last month.

20:21.065 --> 20:23.483
No forwarding address,
but I got an A.D.A.

20:23.484 --> 20:25.901
to sign off on a warrant
for her cellphone.

20:25.936 --> 20:28.804
- Mm-hmm.
- Hopefully, that leads somewhere.

20:28.839 --> 20:31.006
I think you're working
about five times harder

20:31.041 --> 20:32.741
than the rest of us.

20:44.355 --> 20:47.089
[door opens]
How's it going?

20:47.124 --> 20:49.291
They're about to remove
land mine number two.

20:49.326 --> 20:51.927
Well, I guess number three
'cause one already exploded, right?

20:51.962 --> 20:53.395
Anyway, they're removing a mine,

20:53.430 --> 20:56.131
and it's not the one that
Korsak's standing on.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.033
How are we going with our tests?

20:58.068 --> 21:00.936
Well, the only explosive
chemicals in our victim's blood

21:00.971 --> 21:03.205
or on that fingertip
were already combusted.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.175
- So he didn't build or hold the mines?
- It doesn't appear so.

21:07.211 --> 21:11.346
- Someone just blew him up.
- Yeah.

21:11.382 --> 21:15.851
- Is this the sample?
- Yes.

21:15.886 --> 21:18.186
Great. Thank you.
That's gonna help a lot.

21:18.222 --> 21:22.958
- What is it?
- A lifetime's worth of favors.

21:37.508 --> 21:39.241
What are you gonna do
with the bomb?

21:39.276 --> 21:40.942
Protocol is to blow it up on scene,

21:40.978 --> 21:42.811
which we'll do once
the sergeant's safe.

21:42.846 --> 21:45.847
Well, is there any way to disarm it,

21:45.883 --> 21:48.216
you know, so we can keep it
for evidence?

21:48.252 --> 21:51.987
- Highly irregular.
- Come on, Bryce. Help us out.

21:52.022 --> 21:53.488
I'm letting you be a hero today.

21:53.524 --> 21:57.092
<i>Tell you what, let's talk about this
over a nice glass of water</i>

21:57.127 --> 21:59.261
<i>when everybody's finished
for the day, okay?</i>

21:59.296 --> 22:01.296
Is that a deal?

22:04.101 --> 22:07.869
This is goethite. It's a
mineral found in limpet teeth.

22:07.905 --> 22:10.205
Limpet?
Like the snail?

22:10.240 --> 22:12.240
It's the strongest material
found in nature.

22:12.276 --> 22:15.010
- It's stronger than kevlar.
- Yeah, Maura got it for us.

22:15.045 --> 22:17.412
It's from the Advanced Material
Research Center.

22:17.448 --> 22:20.282
Huh.
Learning all sorts of things today,

22:20.317 --> 22:23.151
like how long it takes your
ass to go numb from not moving.

22:23.187 --> 22:27.155
Yeah.
And that snails have teeth.

22:29.126 --> 22:32.093
Uh-oh. Rubber's
about to hit the road.

22:32.129 --> 22:33.428
Yeah.

22:35.532 --> 22:39.267
Uh, now that
the field is clear, um...

22:39.303 --> 22:41.804
They'll use the limpet
teeth to protect you in case

22:41.805 --> 22:44.306
the bomb goes off ...
when they yank you off of it.

22:44.341 --> 22:47.075
Yank?
Doesn't sound very technical.

22:53.350 --> 22:55.884
Time to head back
to the command center.

22:56.820 --> 23:00.388
- Okay, go ahead.
- No. You.

23:00.424 --> 23:01.523
No!

23:02.493 --> 23:04.125
This is Bryce's operation, detective.

23:04.161 --> 23:06.561
And I'm not going anywhere, sergeant.

23:06.597 --> 23:10.098
Please, Jane.

23:16.340 --> 23:19.242
Vince...
[sighs]

23:19.243 --> 23:22.277
It's gonna be all right.

23:22.312 --> 23:25.013
Got limpet's teeth.

call you sooner.</i>

<i>We were dealing with a bomb.</i>

25:00.508 --> 25:01.607
<i>Had to call in the bomb squad.</i>

25:01.643 --> 25:04.143
Yeah, everything's all right.

25:04.179 --> 25:07.080
Am I fine?
Of course.

25:07.115 --> 25:10.249
But I'll ...
I'll call you later.

25:10.285 --> 25:13.252
Yeah, love you, too.
[cellphone beeps]

25:15.590 --> 25:17.590
It's a story best told in person.

25:17.625 --> 25:21.394
I also got a text from Nina.
She found the hacker's cousin.

25:21.429 --> 25:24.697
Yeah. About an hour ago.
She's in interrogation.

25:24.892 --> 25:26.725
This woman could lead us to the
person who's been after you.

25:26.761 --> 25:27.993
Why didn't you come here
and talk to her?

25:28.029 --> 25:30.029
'Cause I was waiting for you.

25:34.902 --> 25:36.836
[sighs]

25:43.410 --> 25:45.377
I stayed out of trouble
since my release.

25:45.412 --> 25:47.212
I got nothing to say to you guys.

25:47.248 --> 25:49.515
You haven't spoken to your
parole officer in three months.

25:49.550 --> 25:52.451
That's bullshit.
Tell him to empty his voice mailbox.

25:52.486 --> 25:53.986
I do what I'm supposed to do.

25:54.021 --> 25:56.021
You know her?

25:57.324 --> 25:59.525
- Don't remember.
- Her name's Lianne Sampson.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.093
You were in
Framingham together.

26:01.128 --> 26:02.361
Yeah, and so were like
2,000 other people.

26:02.396 --> 26:03.896
You want to show me
their pictures, too?

26:05.366 --> 26:08.867
<i>How about Dr. Joe Harris?</i>

26:08.903 --> 26:12.004
- Who's that?
- Prison psychiatrist.

26:12.039 --> 26:14.306
Don't need a shrink.
Never have.

26:14.341 --> 26:16.275
Did you ever talk to anyone
in Framingham

26:16.310 --> 26:17.509
about your cousin Riley ...

26:17.545 --> 26:19.244
the one who's good
with computers?

26:21.916 --> 26:24.216
No.

26:24.251 --> 26:26.285
And why the hell
would I tell you if I had?

26:26.320 --> 26:28.353
Look, Rhonda, you don't seem
like the type of person

26:28.389 --> 26:30.489
that would make a plan to take
out a cop and her family,

26:30.524 --> 26:32.291
so why don't
you just drop the attitude ...

26:32.326 --> 26:35.093
- I'm done.
- You sit down!

26:35.129 --> 26:36.328
Sit down!

26:36.363 --> 26:37.930
- That's enough, Jane.
- Now!

26:37.965 --> 26:39.198
- I'm gonna sue your ass!
- You're gonna sue me?

26:39.233 --> 26:42.218
- I'll give you a reason to sue me!
- All right, all right, all right, damn it.

26:42.219 --> 26:42.901
Shut up. Sit down! Come here!

26:42.937 --> 26:45.003
- I'll give you a reason to sue me!
- Get outside.

26:45.573 --> 26:47.573
You sit with me for an hour
while I'm standing on a bomb,

26:47.608 --> 26:50.108
but you can't deal with a
shithead parolee for 10 minutes?

26:50.144 --> 26:53.345
- Oh, I'm so sorry!
- Oh, you will be sorry, I bet!

26:53.380 --> 26:56.114
- She burned my house down!
- No, she did not!

26:57.952 --> 27:01.253
But at least we know
we're on the right track.

27:01.288 --> 27:03.222
The only definitive answer
we got in there

27:03.257 --> 27:05.457
was that she didn't talk
about the hacker in prison.

27:05.492 --> 27:09.094
Which means she talked
about the hacker in prison.

27:09.129 --> 27:12.130
Yes!
We were looking at thousands

27:12.166 --> 27:15.534
of inmates, employees, vendors.
Now we can narrow it down

27:15.569 --> 27:18.203
to the folks that actually
intersected with Joe Harris,

27:18.239 --> 27:19.872
Lianne Sampson, and Rhonda.

27:19.907 --> 27:22.908
You're right...
You're right.

27:22.943 --> 27:24.409
After all that time in the sun,

27:24.445 --> 27:26.645
I'm surprised you had the energy
to go after her like that.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.180
[chuckles]

27:28.215 --> 27:31.984
- [crying] She was really annoying.
- Oh, yes, she was.

27:43.230 --> 27:44.630
You look flush.

27:44.665 --> 27:49.568
I... might have just lost it
on a suspect.

27:49.603 --> 27:53.005
It's just been one of those days.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.307
[sighs]

27:55.342 --> 28:00.279
- What's this?
- This is a disemboweled land mine

28:00.314 --> 28:03.682
made of salvaged parts from
junkyards and old machinery.

28:03.717 --> 28:06.585
It roughly follows some plans
that I found on the internet.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.186
Can we trace it?

28:08.222 --> 28:11.463
No fingerprints or DNA
that I've been able to find.

28:11.498 --> 28:12.557
No serial numbers on the parts.

28:12.593 --> 28:15.060
The only thing that might be
able to help you

28:15.095 --> 28:17.079
is that the gunpowder that was used as

28:17.080 --> 28:19.064
the explosive element has boron in it.

28:19.099 --> 28:23.268
- And what would that do?
- Make it explode in a green color.

28:23.304 --> 28:26.305
It's often used in fireworks
and military flares.

28:26.640 --> 28:30.575
It's something.
Okay.

28:30.611 --> 28:33.045
Oh, hey.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.280
- Thank you.
- For what?

28:35.316 --> 28:40.052
- For the teeth thingy.
- My pleasure.

28:43.524 --> 28:44.957
[door opens]

28:44.992 --> 28:48.493
- Our victim had enemies.
- Narrowing down the hate mails, are we?

28:48.529 --> 28:50.195
I ran it through a search engine

28:50.230 --> 28:52.064
that responds to certain trigger words.

28:52.099 --> 28:54.032
<i>Anything threatening
or violent in nature.</i>

28:54.068 --> 28:55.701
<i>The e-mails with the highest
number of trigger words</i>

28:55.736 --> 29:00.072
all came from the same person ...
Jenny Evans.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.240
Looks like she was on the ground
in the Cambodian village

29:02.276 --> 29:04.376
that the NGO recently evacuated.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.044
- She worked for Franklin?
- Yeah.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.614
- Until she quit.
- She seems pissed.

29:09.650 --> 29:12.617
<i>Well, she's passionate.
That's for sure.</i>

29:12.653 --> 29:14.486
Let's bring her in and see
what she's been doing

29:14.521 --> 29:17.456
- since she got back from Southeast Asia.
- Sure.

29:25.299 --> 29:26.465
[sighs]

29:28.702 --> 29:32.337
There's something that you're hiding
about this bomb situation.

29:32.373 --> 29:34.482
- Kiki...
- I could hear it in your voice,

29:34.533 --> 29:37.112
and I can see it in your face.

29:38.612 --> 29:40.445
[sighs]

29:40.481 --> 29:42.280
The bomb was actually a land mine.

29:42.316 --> 29:44.282
I stepped on it.
I had to be extracted.

29:44.318 --> 29:47.419
It was a precision operation.
Our bomb techs are the best.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.054
Here I am without a scratch.

29:49.089 --> 29:50.088
Oh, my god.

29:50.124 --> 29:52.424
- But you could have been ...
- That's the job.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.227
I know.

29:55.262 --> 29:59.664
- [sniffles] I know that.
- I fully intended to tell you,

29:59.700 --> 30:01.566
but I'm so in it trying
to find the sicko

30:01.602 --> 30:05.570
that put that mine in the ground.
I'm okay.

30:05.606 --> 30:07.072
Are you?

30:09.176 --> 30:12.044
I don't ... I, uh...

30:12.079 --> 30:14.279
[voice breaking] I think I need time.

30:17.384 --> 30:20.652
Okay.
Whatever you need.

30:22.756 --> 30:25.270
But I'm glad you're safe.

30:26.593 --> 30:28.727
Me too.

30:28.762 --> 30:31.229
[music]

30:34.802 --> 30:38.267
[sighs]
[door closes]

30:42.150 --> 30:45.150
I can't believe this is how I'm
finding out that John's dead.

30:45.186 --> 30:47.419
Walter should have
at least called me.

30:47.455 --> 30:50.089
Even though you didn't work
there anymore?

30:50.124 --> 30:52.224
I was more than just an employee.

30:52.260 --> 30:57.263
John and I were together for years
until a couple of months ago.

30:57.298 --> 31:00.165
You sent some pretty angry
e-mails, threatening, even.

31:00.201 --> 31:01.967
Yeah, well, they were supposed
to be a wake-up call,

31:02.003 --> 31:04.436
which didn't work, obviously.

31:04.472 --> 31:05.638
What do you mean, "wake-up calls"?

31:05.673 --> 31:10.309
He was losing perspective,
falling into the money trap.

31:10.344 --> 31:13.178
There's plenty of profit to be
made in the nonprofit world.

31:13.214 --> 31:14.680
Trust me.

31:14.715 --> 31:18.083
Is it so bad to make a little
money while helping others?

31:18.119 --> 31:22.087
Except they weren't helping others,
not as much as they could.

31:22.123 --> 31:24.690
They were going to parties,
being full of themselves.

31:24.725 --> 31:26.225
A couple of photo ops
with a congressman

31:26.260 --> 31:27.726
does not make you Bono.

31:27.762 --> 31:30.829
- Did John ever write you back?
- No.

31:30.865 --> 31:33.732
Last I heard, he was shagging
some hotel heiress

31:33.768 --> 31:36.287
he met at a Vanity Fair party.

31:36.322 --> 31:39.305
I mean, I can't believe
that's who he's become.

31:41.108 --> 31:44.743
Katherine Bryant, 38.
Her family controls a chain

31:44.779 --> 31:46.578
of budget motels
across the country.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.215
- Company's valued around $1 billion.
- Never heard of her.

31:50.251 --> 31:52.084
Yeah, I think that's how she likes it.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.752
She's a notoriously private person.

31:53.788 --> 31:56.221
Her online presence has been
totally scrubbed.

31:56.257 --> 31:58.857
<i>I was able to find one article
that mentions her</i>

31:58.893 --> 32:00.592
from Equatorial Guinea.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.728
It's a piece about the de-mining
efforts in that region.

32:02.763 --> 32:04.330
And she just happens to be
with our victim.

32:04.365 --> 32:08.367
- For 3 1/2 weeks.
- Are we talking about the heiress?

32:08.402 --> 32:11.103
Current theory ... scorned woman
plants land mine.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.772
- You got anything better?
- I do.

32:13.808 --> 32:15.374
Jilted husband plants mine

32:15.409 --> 32:17.576
to send message to victim
and cheating wife.

32:17.611 --> 32:20.346
- Husband?
- I found no record of a husband.

32:20.381 --> 32:21.714
She didn't change her name.

32:21.749 --> 32:23.615
And on paper, they exist
as very separate entities,

32:23.651 --> 32:24.883
but yes, she is married.

32:24.919 --> 32:26.719
I bet the husband
didn't like seeing her

32:26.754 --> 32:29.188
<i>in the paper with another man
halfway around the world.</i>

32:29.223 --> 32:30.489
All the politics aside,

32:30.524 --> 32:31.757
we might have a crime
of passion on our hands.

32:41.202 --> 32:43.502
Hey!
You want to grab some dinner?

32:43.537 --> 32:45.637
There's a pub in Charlestown
I've been dying to try.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.840
Oh...

32:47.875 --> 32:50.509
- I just made noodles.
- Mm...

32:50.544 --> 32:53.229
- What's all this?
- Every single person

32:53.230 --> 32:55.914
who was at Framingham
during Rhonda's stay.

32:55.950 --> 32:58.784
So, what are you
looking for exactly?

32:58.819 --> 33:01.420
I am trying to figure out
which of them

33:01.455 --> 33:04.690
interacted with both Rhonda
and Joe Harris while there.

33:04.725 --> 33:06.925
[sighs]

33:09.764 --> 33:12.664
- What are you doing?
- Helping you.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.832
No, Maura. Come on.
It's late.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.535
- You don't have to do this.
- Look, you're not the only one

33:16.570 --> 33:18.337
that this is happening to, all right?

33:18.372 --> 33:20.372
I want to find this name
as badly as you do.

33:20.408 --> 33:25.046
So, just think of me as
one more cactus on your ledge.

33:28.282 --> 33:30.562
Want some noodles?

33:33.621 --> 33:35.788
Sure.

33:41.328 --> 33:43.829
[blues guitar plays]

33:45.900 --> 33:48.534
- Good night.
- What's this?

33:48.569 --> 33:51.804
Oh, uh, swatches.

33:51.839 --> 33:55.707
- For your reception.
- Ahh.

33:55.743 --> 33:58.944
You know, this morning,
I woke up, had coffee,

33:58.979 --> 34:02.548
promised Kiki I'd go
cake-tasting with her on Saturday.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.783
Then I went to work and...

34:04.819 --> 34:07.853
spent the day wondering whether
it would be my last one on Earth.

34:07.888 --> 34:12.491
- Wow, hearing you say it is so scary.
- And a good reminder.

34:12.525 --> 34:14.993
What, of all the murderers
out there?

34:15.029 --> 34:19.498
No. That life is unpredictable
and precious.

34:19.533 --> 34:21.867
We should always live
for the moment ...

34:21.902 --> 34:26.058
land mine or no land mine.
[blues music continue]

34:26.540 --> 34:29.341
Hmm.
You know what, Vince?

34:30.777 --> 34:32.678
I think you have to get someone

34:32.713 --> 34:37.382
to cover my shift tomorrow night.
Thanks.

34:37.418 --> 34:39.650
<i>Good night.</i>

34:41.422 --> 34:42.788
[door opens]

34:42.822 --> 34:45.389
[sea gulls crying]

34:45.426 --> 34:47.259
<i>John: With your support,</i>

34:47.293 --> 34:49.594
<i>we can maximize resources
and save countless lives.</i>

34:49.630 --> 34:52.531
<i>My business plan is built on
restraint and transparency.</i>

34:52.565 --> 34:55.266
<i>Your dollars go to
the communities we serve,</i>

34:55.302 --> 34:57.903
<i>not into the pockets of
corporate bureaucrats...</i>

34:57.938 --> 35:00.772
- He's very compelling.
- And apparently not the cheating type.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.724
Our heiress told us she was
funding his mission.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.626
She was in Africa to observe
his operation.

35:04.662 --> 35:05.961
We believe her?

35:05.996 --> 35:07.963
Our financial people
sent over the paperwork.

35:07.998 --> 35:10.632
- They were definitely making a deal.
- Said he had an epiphany.

35:10.668 --> 35:12.434
He wanted to get back to his roots,

35:12.469 --> 35:16.204
- in terms of his original vision.
- So it wasn't an affair.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.106
Well, he was kind of cheating
on his business partner.

35:18.142 --> 35:20.108
Yeah, he told the heiress
that his partner, Park,

35:20.144 --> 35:22.978
was more interested in executive
perks than in the mission itself.

35:23.013 --> 35:24.980
<i>Our guy wanted to start over,</i>

35:25.015 --> 35:26.982
downsize the administrative
costs of the NGO.

35:27.017 --> 35:29.217
Oh. So bye-bye parties
and photo ops.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.854
Guess what we just found
at Walter Park's house.

35:32.890 --> 35:35.657
- Not Walter Park?
- Nope.

35:35.693 --> 35:38.193
And uniforms stopped by his office.
He's not there, either.

35:38.228 --> 35:40.996
But we did find John Franklin's
investor video.

35:41.031 --> 35:43.231
- So he knew.
- Yeah.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.966
Which gives him a big, fat motive.

35:45.002 --> 35:47.569
He knew he was about to lose
his oversized salary.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.138
- Mm-hmm.
- The prison list.

35:50.174 --> 35:52.841
I've highlighted some names
I think you'll want to look at.

35:52.876 --> 35:54.876
- Thank you.
- Nina: Here it is.

35:54.912 --> 35:57.112
Park has a waterfront property
in New Hampshire.

35:58.682 --> 36:00.582
Oh, and look at that.

36:00.617 --> 36:03.018
He throws an annual
4th of July celebration there

36:03.053 --> 36:06.221
with a dazzling display of fireworks.

36:06.256 --> 36:07.889
And the fireworks would explain

36:07.925 --> 36:09.157
the boron in the gunpowder
we found in the mine.

36:09.193 --> 36:11.893
Mm-hmm.
Who wants to go to New Hampshire?

36:11.929 --> 36:14.429
Line up behind me.

36:20.115 --> 36:22.682
[laughter]

[indistinct conversations]

36:42.604 --> 36:45.005
[music]

36:48.410 --> 36:50.649
- It's over, Park!
- No.

36:50.684 --> 36:52.846
No, I'm getting on my boat,
and I'm leaving.

36:52.881 --> 36:56.116
And then what?
You think your political friends

36:56.151 --> 36:58.118
will stick by you
if you flee the scene?

36:58.153 --> 36:59.519
Put it down.

36:59.554 --> 37:01.021
Come on in.
We'll talk about it.

37:01.923 --> 37:03.023
Not another step.

37:09.564 --> 37:10.930
Leave us alone.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.901
Get out!

37:14.936 --> 37:16.169
That's an order, detective.

37:16.204 --> 37:17.670
Bomb squad will be here any minute,

37:17.706 --> 37:19.172
and I'm not leaving you alone again.

37:19.207 --> 37:24.477
All right.
Holster your weapon.

37:31.086 --> 37:32.685
What are you doing?

37:32.721 --> 37:36.089
I've been thinking about
explosives a lot lately...

37:36.124 --> 37:38.425
ever since I stepped on one.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.693
And I'm asking myself,

37:40.729 --> 37:44.132
"what kind of person murders
someone with a land mine?"

37:44.833 --> 37:47.171
And you know
what I came up with?

37:49.004 --> 37:52.439
- A coward.
- Ohh!

37:52.474 --> 37:54.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

37:54.609 --> 37:56.142
- What are you doing?
- It's a fake.

37:56.178 --> 37:59.446
He was trying to pass
a clothesline off as det cord.

37:59.481 --> 38:02.782
Well, if you knew that,
why did you tell me to leave?

38:02.818 --> 38:05.325
'Cause I could have been wrong.

38:05.511 --> 38:07.739
<i>Troopers!
[music]</i>

38:11.126 --> 38:14.060
Wait, what?
Korsak!

38:16.832 --> 38:20.800
<i>♪ Turn the lights on ♪</i>

38:20.836 --> 38:23.069
<i>♪ oh oh oh ♪</i>

38:23.105 --> 38:26.573
The man who put my fiancé
in danger is behind bars.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.609
So that term still applies?

38:29.644 --> 38:32.245
What, fiancé?
Why wouldn't it?

38:32.280 --> 38:35.482
Well, I've lost two wives to this job.

38:35.517 --> 38:38.218
- When you said you needed time, I ...
- I meant I needed time.

38:38.253 --> 38:40.153
Vince, I want to marry you...

38:40.188 --> 38:42.522
<i>as soon as possible, actually.</i>

38:42.557 --> 38:44.724
Smaller wedding, less planning.

38:44.759 --> 38:46.059
Sounds perfect.

38:46.094 --> 38:48.761
[chuckles] Good.
Let's have some champagne.

38:48.797 --> 38:51.764
Two champagnes.
The good stuff.

38:53.602 --> 38:54.601
[sighs]

38:54.636 --> 38:56.069
<i>Frankie: Thank you.</i>

38:56.104 --> 38:59.272
<i>- Wow, thank you.
- Yes.</i>

39:01.143 --> 39:04.978
Ma, you are wearing
a jaunty beret.

39:05.013 --> 39:07.147
I came to say <i> au revoir.</i>

39:07.182 --> 39:10.517
Ron is picking me up
and taking me to Paris.

39:10.552 --> 39:12.519
Paris, France?

39:12.554 --> 39:14.754
How romantic.
A Parisian getaway.

39:14.789 --> 39:19.125
- Good for you, Ma.
- Yeah, well, I decided to seize the day.

39:19.161 --> 39:23.062
- And the hat.
- [laughs] Am I pulling it off?

39:23.098 --> 39:25.932
<i>Trés chic.
It's a great look for you.</i>

39:25.967 --> 39:29.202
You and Che Guevara.
[laughter]

39:29.237 --> 39:30.937
I'll see you all soon.
[cellphone vibrates]

39:30.972 --> 39:32.739
Have fun!

39:32.774 --> 39:34.707
Oh, that's Nina.
She's still at the office.

39:34.743 --> 39:36.075
[cellphone beeps]
Hey, what's up?

39:39.047 --> 39:41.548
No, I don't want to wait till tomorrow.
I-I'll come in now.

39:41.583 --> 39:44.083
<i>Okay, I'll see you.
[cellphone beeps]</i>

39:44.119 --> 39:46.753
Uh, Nina's got something.

39:49.791 --> 39:51.624
[elevator bell dings]

39:51.660 --> 39:54.727
Been through civilians,
staff, and inmates.

39:54.763 --> 39:57.564
- I think I found her.
- Okay, let's see.

39:57.599 --> 39:59.299
She was in Framingham
with Rhonda Hearn.

39:59.334 --> 40:01.167
They were housed
in the same cellblock.

40:01.203 --> 40:03.002
And while she wasn't a patient
of Joe Harris,

40:03.038 --> 40:04.904
she has a work duty that
puts her in the sector

40:04.940 --> 40:07.370
where his office is
three times a week.

40:09.945 --> 40:11.344
Do you know her?

40:11.379 --> 40:13.713
Well, she looks familiar,
but I-I don't know how.

40:13.748 --> 40:15.215
Her name is Alice Sands.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.183
Mnh-mnh.
I don't recognize it.

40:17.219 --> 40:19.919
- What is she in for?
- Possession with intent.

40:19.955 --> 40:22.989
She's in the home stretch
of a four-year sentence.

40:23.024 --> 40:25.091
Her maiden name is McFadden.
Does that help?

40:25.126 --> 40:26.793
McFadden...

40:27.328 --> 40:31.197
Yes! Yes, we were in
the police academy together,

40:31.233 --> 40:33.600
but ... but she ...
she left before we graduated.

40:33.635 --> 40:36.002
Sergeant Detective Vince Korsak,
Boston Police.

40:36.037 --> 40:38.137
Need information on a current inmate.

40:38.173 --> 40:39.872
Answering service.

40:39.908 --> 40:41.841
Admins have all gone home
for the night.

40:41.876 --> 40:43.710
I don't even remember this woman.

40:43.745 --> 40:46.746
- Why would she come after you?
- I honestly have no idea.

40:46.781 --> 40:49.349
They're saying the earliest
we can get it is tomorrow.

40:49.350 --> 40:51.031
[scoffs]

40:51.419 --> 40:54.177
I'm not waiting till tomorrow.

40:57.259 --> 40:59.225
[music]

40:59.261 --> 41:02.295
I'm sorry, detectives.
I want to help you.

41:02.330 --> 41:05.164
- Then open the door.
- I'm forbidden from doing that

41:05.200 --> 41:07.033
except for medical emergencies.

41:07.068 --> 41:10.303
I want to see this woman,
and I want to see her now.

41:10.338 --> 41:12.705
Then you have to contact
my superiors.

41:12.741 --> 41:15.908
This inmate burned down my apartment.

41:15.944 --> 41:20.046
She kidnapped the Chief Medical
Examiner of the Commonwealth!

41:20.081 --> 41:23.316
- She is also an accessory to murder!
- I want to help you, detective,

41:23.351 --> 41:25.018
but I don't want to lose my job!

41:25.053 --> 41:26.252
<i>[computer beeps]
Then you call the warden.</i>

41:26.288 --> 41:28.921
<i>You call the mayor if you have to!
I don't care who you call!</i>

41:28.957 --> 41:30.290
You just open that door!

41:30.325 --> 41:31.691
- Jane!
- What?!

41:31.726 --> 41:33.595
She was released three days ago.

41:33.630 --> 41:36.162
