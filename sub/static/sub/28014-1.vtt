02:13.834 --> 02:14.668
Mm.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.272
Hello, handsome,
you almost home?

02:19.273 --> 02:20.773
Hey, baby, hey, it looks like

02:20.774 --> 02:23.410
I'm gonna be working
a little late tonight.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.812
Hmm, is everything okay.

02:25.813 --> 02:26.979
Yeah, yeah, everything is cool,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.015
I just got a extra
fare that I need to do.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.151
Well, that's my
baby, always working.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.922
You know, we have the place
all to ourselves tonight.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.424
We do?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.025
Where's Angelique at?

02:39.026 --> 02:41.328
She's sleeping
over Tance's house.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.296
Oh, that's right.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.997
That's tonight.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.802
Uh-huh, and now you're
gonna make me wait for you.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.071
You know I hate it when
you tease me like that.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.641
You know you like it.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.245
I've been thinking
about you all day.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.881
I might have to take
matters into my own hands.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.916
Now who's teasing who?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.054
Be safe, okay, baby?

03:08.055 --> 03:09.022
I love you.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.323
Alright, love you too, baby.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.772
You must be my ride.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.940
Are you Thomas?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.376
Yes, sir.
Alright, hop in.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.690
How you doing tonight?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.692
I'm excellent,
how about yourself?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.862
Not bad, about to get off.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.366
Yeah, good for you.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.235
My night's just getting started.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.672
So where you headed?

04:33.907 --> 04:36.443
Straight to Hell along
with everybody else.

04:40.047 --> 04:40.881
I'm sorry?

04:42.049 --> 04:46.353
But first, how about
235 Detroit Street?

04:46.354 --> 04:47.187
Okay, alright.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.017
It says you have a
five star Ryde rating.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.220
Yeah, request the
best, that's what I say.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.423
You been doing this awhile?

05:23.424 --> 05:24.625
Yeah, a couple months.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.460
Pretty good gig?

05:27.895 --> 05:28.729
Ah, it's alright.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.230
You're full time?

05:31.231 --> 05:33.132
Nah, just after the day job.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.334
Keeps me out of trouble.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.673
You ever have a
really bad passenger?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.375
Nah, most of 'em
are pretty chill.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.810
Really?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.912
Come on.
No, seriously.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.082
That's cop-out, seriously,
your worse passenger?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.419
Hmm, my worst passenger.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.022
Absolute worst passenger ever?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.057
My worst passenger.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.059
Hmm, let me think.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.596
Okay, alright, so,
a few weeks ago,

06:03.597 --> 06:06.133
I'm driving this dude and
this girl to a concert,

06:07.568 --> 06:10.537
and both of 'em is as drunk
as a skunk and high as a kite.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.339
Halfway there, he realizes he
forgot his phone back at home,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.908
and you know, his phone
had his tickets on it.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.811
Anyway, this dude he's just
flipped out on this girl,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.580
sayin' that she was
supposed to remind him

06:20.581 --> 06:22.214
about the tickets
and everything,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.816
and then he just
like raised his hand

06:23.817 --> 06:24.851
like he was gonna hit her.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.085
Did he?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.319
No, he didn't hit her,

06:27.320 --> 06:28.488
but you could tell that
he had done it before

06:28.489 --> 06:29.956
by the way that she flinched,

06:29.957 --> 06:31.758
and then I just told him
to calm the hell down,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.426
and then he started
threatening me.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.827
So what you do?

06:34.828 --> 06:36.596
I told him that if
he didn't calm down

06:36.597 --> 06:38.731
I was gonna call the cops.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.500
So I turned around and
drove him back home.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.035
He was pouting and
shit and complaining,

06:43.036 --> 06:44.236
and then he got his and phone,

06:44.237 --> 06:46.138
then I drove 'em
back to the concert.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.373
I didn't even charge them

06:47.374 --> 06:49.108
for the extra time
and the mileage,

06:49.109 --> 06:50.677
and then had the nerve
to call corporate

06:50.678 --> 06:51.744
and give me a zero rating.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.979
Can you believe that?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.313
You should have kicked his ass.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.348
Yeah, you're right.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.118
No, I'm serious.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.921
Any man that lays his
hand on a woman like that

07:01.922 --> 07:03.956
deserves to be punished.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.157
But he didn't
actually touch her.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.093
Yeah, but you
said you could tell

07:06.094 --> 07:07.894
he'd done it before, right?

07:07.895 --> 07:08.829
Well that was my
impression, yeah.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.563
Do you trust your instincts?

07:10.564 --> 07:11.664
Usually.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.500
And he threatened you?

07:13.501 --> 07:14.934
Yeah.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.004
You should have
broke his fucking nose.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.673
I mean it, seriously.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.543
If I was back here with a girl
that I was clearly abusing,

07:23.544 --> 07:25.478
and you spoke up for her
and I threatened you,

07:25.479 --> 07:26.379
what would you do?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.149
Huh?

07:30.417 --> 07:31.984
Well with all due respect,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.587
I would break your fucking nose.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.256
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.861
Ah, fuck.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.896
Is everything okay?

07:43.897 --> 07:44.732
Ah, my phone.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.535
Well, you wanna use mine?

07:48.602 --> 07:49.836
Could I?

07:49.837 --> 07:50.671
Yeah, sure.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.440
Thanks, I appreciate it.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.544
Yeah, don't mention it.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.381
It's Thomas.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.051
No, I have good news.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.154
Mr. Richardson
agreed to your terms.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.223
Yes, in fact, he already has.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.260
I have it right with me.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.964
You gonna be around for
awhile, I mean, I'm on my way.

08:18.899 --> 08:19.733
Yes.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.569
You're welcome.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.506
I really appreciate it.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.709
Yeah, no problem, man.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.197
By the way, your
numbers don't add up.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.099
I'm sorry?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.936
You said you'd been working
for two months, give or take?

08:56.937 --> 08:59.505
Yeah, a couple
months, give or take.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.807
Hell, let's call it 10 weeks

09:00.808 --> 09:05.779
and two or three days a
week, let's say three.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.581
What, 10 fares a night?

09:08.582 --> 09:11.050
On average, yeah,
that's about right.

09:11.051 --> 09:16.056
That's a total of 300
fares in 10 weeks, liberally?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.257
Okay.

09:18.258 --> 09:23.096
Well, Ryde does its calculations
on tenths of percentages.

09:24.732 --> 09:28.434
So even with one zero rating,

09:28.435 --> 09:32.271
you would need no
less than 2,000 fares,

09:32.272 --> 09:37.277
1,999 of them,
five star ratings,

09:38.445 --> 09:39.579
just to average out
to a five star rating.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.248
Yeah, so?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.217
So that's
statistically impossible

09:45.285 --> 09:46.986
unless you're
tweaking the numbers.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.689
Hey, look, I just drive the car.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.923
Are you?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.725
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.761
Dude, it's okay.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.195
Seriously.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.864
It's none of my business.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.598
If anything, I'm impressed.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.700
I wouldn't have the first clue

10:00.701 --> 10:02.101
how to mess with their system.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.336
Look, man, I'm just
trying to make a living.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.906
I'm serious, no worries.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.476
It's not the worst thing
anyone's ever done, right?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.545
I mean, you're
obviously a good driver.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.322
So what's the worst
thing you've ever done?

10:25.659 --> 10:26.493
We're here.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.000
Shit.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.535
The gate code is 4247#.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.790
And make a left here.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.396
It's that one.

11:05.098 --> 11:05.933
Straight up.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.841
Well, Mr. Thomas, it's
been an interesting evening.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.077
Well, I'm gonna
need a ride back.

11:18.445 --> 11:22.782
I'm sorry, did you have
plans or something?

11:22.783 --> 11:23.983
Ah, actually...

11:23.984 --> 11:26.118
Shit, man, you
should have told me.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.486
I thought I did.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.490
Shit, man, now I feel terrible.

11:31.725 --> 11:35.527
Look, it'll only
take a minute, okay?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.229
I promise.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.465
And then you can just drop
me off on the way back.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.601
It's probably right
on your way anyway.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.237
Yeah, no worries, man.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.007
I'll even tip ya
extra, I promise.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.343
Just give me a sec, I
gotta get organized here.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.281
Can you hold this for a sec?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.249
Yeah.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.188
Nice pen.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.289
You like it?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.423
Yeah.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.692
It's a retirement gift.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.732
Alright, I'll be back
in two minutes, tops.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.634
Alright, I'll be here.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.904
Alright, I'll be right back.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.325
Shit.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.861
Well, that was quick.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.031
I was in the neighborhood.
Come on in.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.769
So, old Richardson finally
came to his senses?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.905
Mr. Richardson came
to the conclusion

12:52.906 --> 12:54.440
that it was pointless to waste

12:54.441 --> 12:57.076
anymore time and money
fighting you people,

12:57.077 --> 12:58.677
when all you're gonna
do is outspend him

12:58.678 --> 13:01.347
and drag this out in
court until he's dead.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.051
Well, that's a morbid way
to put it, but.

13:17.965 --> 13:18.798
Excellent.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.701
Well, I guess that's that.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.438
Yeah, it'll be nice to
put all this behind us.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.609
Ooh, would you be willing
to sign as a witness?

13:30.743 --> 13:31.578
Why not?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.982
Ah, do you have a pen?

13:35.983 --> 13:36.917
Oh, yeah.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.055
Perfect.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.428
See, what'd I tell ya?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.030
That was quick.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.631
23rd and Park?

14:59.632 --> 15:00.600
Is that on your way?

15:00.601 --> 15:02.034
Yeah, sure.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.402
Let's get you home.

15:39.906 --> 15:40.740
Who's that?

15:42.342 --> 15:44.076
Text from my wife.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.545
She's probably
wondering where I am.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.546
I'm sorry, man.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.515
It'll be over soon.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.255
Zacharias.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.524
Biblical name.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.793
Are you a religious
man, Zacharias?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.262
I don't know about that.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.763
Spiritual, maybe.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.399
Do you believe in original sin?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.602
You mean like, Adam and Eve?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.171
The apple?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.505
I don't know about all that,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.574
but I believe in
The Golden Rule,

16:15.575 --> 16:18.110
treat people the way
you wanna be treated.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.678
Wouldn't that
be a world to live in?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.714
Yeah, man, it sure would.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.852
So what do you believe?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.888
I believe there's an
unbroken chain of sin

16:29.889 --> 16:32.591
that stretches back to
the dawn of civilization.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.327
I believe it is
truly the only thing

16:35.328 --> 16:37.364
that unites us as a species.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.333
Okay, um, wow.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.601
Think about it.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.505
We live on a planet of
seven billion people.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.041
There are eight people
who are as wealthy

16:49.042 --> 16:52.011
as the poorest 3.5
billion combined.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.981
We have enough resources
and food in this country

16:55.982 --> 16:58.417
to feed, cloth, and
house every man,

16:58.418 --> 17:00.252
woman, and child in America,

17:00.253 --> 17:02.155
yet there are people
starving everyday.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.824
We've created a
society where a man

17:05.825 --> 17:07.193
could work 50 hours a week

17:07.194 --> 17:09.560
for the same
company for decades,

17:09.561 --> 17:12.131
give his entire life
to that company,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.334
only for that company
to file chapter 11

17:15.468 --> 17:18.238
and get rid of his
pension and his 401K.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.374
And the icing on the cake,

17:22.474 --> 17:23.710
it doesn't even matter

17:25.145 --> 17:28.414
because the cancer that he got
from working at that company

17:28.415 --> 17:30.817
is gonna kill him in less
than two years anyway.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.220
That's the society we live in.

17:34.787 --> 17:38.357
That's the way
humanity was designed.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.193
We evolved to take
advantage of each other.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.661
To screw each other over.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.296
It's survival of the fittest.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.700
We pretend like we care about
each other but deep down,

17:49.369 --> 17:52.139
we're hardwired to
destroy one another.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.576
You asked me where
I was heading,

17:59.712 --> 18:01.047
do you remember what I said?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
Do you believe in
Hell, Zacharias?

18:10.022 --> 18:10.857
You should.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.426
We created it.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.836
Shit.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.844
Shit.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.847
How many
times am I going to warn you?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.384
Okay.
What are you doing here?

18:38.385 --> 18:40.553
How many times am I gonna
tell you not to stay here?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.889
Are you okay?

18:43.890 --> 18:46.759
Hey, what
seems to be the problem?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.495
There is no problem.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.363
Then why are you
harassing this guy?

18:51.364 --> 18:54.466
Sir, this is not your business.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.834
It is my business.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.569
Can I ask you a question?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.104
He hangs out here all of the day

18:59.105 --> 19:00.939
and scares away my customers.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.341
It's a free country.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.742
This is a private property,

19:03.743 --> 19:04.877
and he is loitering.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.714
Come on, gather your things.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.517
Don't touch him again.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.922
Sir, if you're going to buy
something, just go inside.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.592
If not, then go
back to your car.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.229
Come on.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.062
Hey.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.998
I told you not to touch him.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.137
I don't like guns in my car.

20:06.138 --> 20:06.973
Relax.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.375
I don't want any trouble, okay?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.876
Look, how about I
just drop you off?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.110
We're almost there.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.445
You don't even have
to pay for the ride.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.014
Zacharias, just drive.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.215
Are you okay?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.820
Look man, I didn't
mean to make you upset.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.088
I'm just trying
to figure you out.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.591
You're some kind of
vigilante, right?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.993
Fighting for the underdog?

21:02.161 --> 21:04.229
Some kind of real
life superhero?

21:04.230 --> 21:07.499
Not even close.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.336
You see someone
being treated unfairly

21:10.337 --> 21:11.970
and you go and help 'em out.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.639
Like that homeless guy, right?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.042
I couldn't care less
about that homeless guy.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.211
I'm sure he has his
list of despicable shit

21:20.212 --> 21:21.648
just like everybody else.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.717
And it's not about fair,

21:26.218 --> 21:27.487
it's about justice.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.089
Aren't they the same thing?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.259
Stop.

21:33.260 --> 21:34.426
Stop!

21:34.427 --> 21:35.294
Go back.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.863
What?
Stop the car.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.698
Turn around.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.032
And turn off your headlamps.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.341
See that guy on
the bike up there?

21:49.275 --> 21:50.809
I want you to sneak up on him.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.877
What did he do?

21:51.878 --> 21:52.979
Don't get smart.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.482
Just do what I'm telling ya.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.519
I want you to get right
behind him and when I say so,

22:00.687 --> 22:02.721
turn on your lights
and hit the gas.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.723
Oh, hell, no.
Zacharias.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.625
No way, man, fuck that shit.

22:06.626 --> 22:11.631
Zacharias, you need
to choose, you or him?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.500
I'm not going to
be a part of this.

22:14.501 --> 22:18.137
Zacharias, I need you to focus.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.708
You need to choose, him or you?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.544
Either you take him out,

22:25.845 --> 22:28.046
or I'm the one
texting your wife,

22:28.047 --> 22:31.418
and telling her to look for
you on the 10 o'clock news.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.921
Three.
You sick motherfucker.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.757
Two.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.959
What's it gonna be, brother?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.160
I'm not gonna do this.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.565
Your choice, one.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.266
Damn it, Zacharias, now!

22:52.405 --> 22:54.272
You sick, motherfucker.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.908
You sick, sadistic motherfucker.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.510
Oh, not bad.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.046
I mean, what the fuck was that?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.114
I needed to see if
I could trust you.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.351
Oh, yeah, trust me to do what?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.820
To do what I told you.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.155
I should have let you shoot me.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.123
I should have let
you fucking shoot me.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.216
23rd and York.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.986
You really want me out
of your car, don't you?

23:40.987 --> 23:42.821
Yeah, I want you out of my car.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.723
I want you out of
my goddamn life.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.558
Alright.

23:46.593 --> 23:49.395
Well, thanks for the ride.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.238
Ya see, the thing is,

24:02.274 --> 24:03.775
how do I know you're
not gonna call the cops?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.111
Oh, c'mon, man, I'm
not gonna call the cops.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.579
I just wanna go home.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.581
See, you say that now.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.117
How could I call the cops
after the bicycle shit?

24:12.118 --> 24:14.320
I'll be in just as much
trouble as you, man.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.489
That's a good point

24:18.725 --> 24:22.962
Still, though, I, I
gotta know for sure.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.497
C'mon.
What?

24:25.498 --> 24:26.898
You're coming with me.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.299
With you where?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.701
To run an errand.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.871
Look, I'm not okay
with your errands.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.840
There's no other
way out of this.

24:50.022 --> 24:50.857
Zacharias,

24:52.825 --> 24:55.694
don't think that just
because you can't see it,

24:55.695 --> 24:57.730
my gun isn't pointed
right at your head.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.810
That's more like it.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.779
C'mon, this won't take long.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.391
C'mon.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.054
Fuck, shit.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.637
Whoa, who the fuck are you guys?

26:11.638 --> 26:12.605
Are you John?

26:14.206 --> 26:15.041
You cops?

26:16.142 --> 26:18.143
No, we're not fucking cops.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.344
We're here to buy some shit.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.079
Rick sent us.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.081
Oh, you know Rick?

26:23.616 --> 26:26.417
Ah, wouldn't be smart.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.187
Who the fuck are you guys?

26:29.188 --> 26:31.556
Do you sell drugs or not?

26:31.557 --> 26:32.758
Fuck off.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.063
That's not way to treat
a potential customer.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.613
The drugs are over
there in the cabinet,

26:55.614 --> 26:59.150
and the money's over there
in the drawer.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.551
I'm not really
worried about the drugs.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.255
Please don't hurt me.

27:05.091 --> 27:09.527
John, what's the worst
thing you've ever done?

27:12.631 --> 27:13.465
Fuck you.

27:15.835 --> 27:19.772
Zacharias, John,
John, Zacharias.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.976
John is a drug dealer
and a pedophile.

27:25.812 --> 27:29.447
John hooked up with a 15
year old girl named Emily,

27:29.448 --> 27:33.584
had sex with her, got her hooked
on meth among other things.

27:33.585 --> 27:37.923
Dude, she said she was 16.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.958
That still makes you
a pedophile, genius.

27:42.729 --> 27:43.930
Emily overdosed on meth.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.631
It's not my fault.
Do you know

27:46.632 --> 27:47.934
what it feels like?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.537
They say it burns.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.308
They say it's
excruciatingly painful.

27:58.477 --> 28:02.147
Almost as painful as having
your kneecaps broken.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.648
Don't, man!
Thomas, Thomas,

28:03.649 --> 28:05.216
Thomas, no, please, man.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.756
Well, that all depends on
your new friend here, Zach.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.090
Two words, Zach, shoot him,

28:12.091 --> 28:16.194
you tell me, I do it.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.263
In the meantime, batter up.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.131
I'm sorry.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.333
Thomas, don't.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.170
Don't hurt me.

28:25.404 --> 28:29.340
Oh, I'm not gonna
break your legs.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.409
I have a better idea.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.718
They say it starts
in your chest.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.854
The burning sensation.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.156
You have trouble breathing,

28:45.157 --> 28:47.893
and then it moves to your
esophagus, to your throat.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.161
Thomas, please, don't.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.331
And it finally
spreads to your skin.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.300
Burning.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.202
Thomas, please.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.771
Two words, Zacharias.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.373
Three,

29:02.408 --> 29:03.242
two,

29:04.676 --> 29:05.944
one.

29:05.945 --> 29:06.978
Here we go.
Thomas, no!

29:13.552 --> 29:15.287
I'm surprised
you didn't stop me.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.989
Should we go again?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.124
No.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.125
What's that?

29:20.126 --> 29:20.960
Shoot him?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.261
Two words, Zach.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.797
Ya gotta say 'em.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.706
Look it, that is crazy

29:35.707 --> 29:38.143
how it leaves the exact
same shape of the iron.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.878
You know, it's kind
of like those cartoons

29:39.879 --> 29:41.913
when they smack 'em in the
face with that frying pan,

29:41.914 --> 29:44.917
and the frying pan looks exactly
like the shape of the face.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.786
This is the same
thing, isn't it?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.689
Hmm, maybe not.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.391
Should we do it again?

29:53.392 --> 29:55.827
No.
Say the words.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.362
Come on, two words.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.997
What was that? I can't hear you.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.265
Two words, Zacharias.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.466
Two words.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.667
Come on, Zacharias.
Shoot him,

30:02.668 --> 30:03.835
goddammit, just shoot
the motherfucker.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.508
That's all you had to say.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.047
Hey, hold on.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.284
Don't wanna burn the place down.

30:24.924 --> 30:28.326
I can't believe how
long you let that go.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.829
I seriously thought you
were gonna stop me sooner.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.764
I think you're the sadist.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.567
Look, this has got to stop.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.369
You'll get used to it, trust me.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.171
It gets easy.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.174
Who's that?

30:43.175 --> 30:45.176
My wife, she's worried.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.078
That wasn't her ringtone.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.146
Who was that?

30:48.147 --> 30:49.015
It's nothing.

30:49.982 --> 30:50.749
Show me.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.623
A ride request from Brad W.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.025
Shared ride.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.792
Thomas?
Well, let's go pick up Brad.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.694
Thomas, look, we
need to be done.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.163
We're done when
I say we're done.

31:06.832 --> 31:07.934
Let's go pick up Brad.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.569
If you're still thinking
about going to the cops,

31:44.570 --> 31:47.838
you should know they're
probably already lookin' for ya

31:47.839 --> 31:49.674
and if they're
not, they will be.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.509
And why is that?

31:51.510 --> 31:56.114
Ah, I kinda set you up.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.416
Remember our first stop?

31:58.617 --> 32:01.086
That big fancy house?

32:01.087 --> 32:02.587
I ducked behind the seat,

32:02.588 --> 32:05.823
so you were the only one
on the camera at the gate,

32:05.824 --> 32:08.493
and after they examine
the murder weapon,

32:08.494 --> 32:09.795
your prints will be on it.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.698
The human eardrum is no match

32:13.699 --> 32:16.401
for a man armed with determination
and a ballpoint pen.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.736
Son of a bitch!

32:18.604 --> 32:20.839
You evil son of a bitch.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.843
So the man with cancer,
is that your dad?

32:25.844 --> 32:27.212
No.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.679
Then who is he?

32:28.680 --> 32:29.981
Some guy I used to work with.

32:29.982 --> 32:34.987
Some guy, some guy
you used to work with?

32:35.854 --> 32:37.222
You just took a man's life

32:37.223 --> 32:39.724
for some guy you
used to work with?

32:39.725 --> 32:41.892
I took his life in
the name of justice.

32:41.893 --> 32:45.030
Yeah, right because
he was a sinner.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.832
Now how would God
judge you, Thomas?

32:47.833 --> 32:49.068
I don't believe in God.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.239
So what about all this
big talk about original sin?

32:54.173 --> 32:55.740
I said I believe in sin,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.476
I never said I believe in God.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.311
If there ever was a God.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.546
I'm pretty sure
he turned his back

33:01.547 --> 33:03.482
on this shit hole
a long time ago.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.087
Game face, Zacharias.

33:09.021 --> 33:09.921
This must be Brad.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.300
Hey, how's it going? I'm Brad.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.634
How's it going, Brad?

33:23.635 --> 33:26.372
Thomas, that's Zacharias.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.673
Working late?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.208
Yeah, I usually am.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.210
Where to Brad?

33:32.244 --> 33:34.212
Ah, 17th and 34th.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.447
Just to the west of City Park.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.515
Got it.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.850
Go ahead and hop in.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.166
So what do you do that
keeps you out so late, Brad?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.467
I'm a loan officer.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.869
I sometimes have to meet
the people pretty late.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.271
A loan officer.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.474
Yeah, like home
loans, mortgages.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.444
So, what, you stick
it to those people

34:06.445 --> 34:09.447
with a 12% interest rate,
you make a million bucks?

34:09.447 --> 34:11.982
Hmm, no, I was actually
able to help them out.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.652
They, ah, I saved
them a lot of money.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.223
Their last guy definitely
screwed 'em pretty good.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.690
I thought that's how
you guys make your money?

34:20.692 --> 34:24.562
High interest rates, subprime
loans, all that stuff.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.531
No, thankfully it's
not like that anymore,

34:26.532 --> 34:27.697
and even more it's
really hard for people

34:27.699 --> 34:29.833
to even qualify for a loan.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.538
What I like to do is find people
that are in bad situations

34:33.539 --> 34:34.905
and get 'em out of those loans,

34:34.906 --> 34:36.607
and get 'em into better loans

34:36.608 --> 34:38.876
that are gonna help
'em in the long run.

34:38.877 --> 34:39.710
Interesting.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.780
So how's business?

34:42.781 --> 34:43.947
Pretty good, unfortunately.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.951
There's a lot of people
in bad situations.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.987
Got a question for you, Brad.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.958
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.293
What?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.396
What's the worst
thing I've ever done?

35:00.299 --> 35:04.269
What, what is this,
cab confessions?

35:04.270 --> 35:06.338
Nah, man, just a question.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.975
What's the worst
thing I've ever done?

35:10.976 --> 35:12.210
Worst thing ever?

35:14.380 --> 35:17.748
Well, when I was a kid
I really wanted a dog

35:17.749 --> 35:19.451
but my dad didn't
let me have one,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.753
so one day I'm walking
home from school,

35:22.754 --> 35:24.922
and I see this stray puppy,

35:24.923 --> 35:27.758
and so I take him home
and I put him in my room,

35:27.759 --> 35:29.794
but a few days later
my dad found out

35:29.795 --> 35:31.330
and he was pretty pissed.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.204
What, what was yours?

35:39.505 --> 35:40.339
Don't ask.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.274
You know what?

35:43.275 --> 35:44.109
Turn here.

35:45.110 --> 35:45.977
It's a shortcut.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.770
Is this your stop?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.608
Thomas, you need
to let this one go.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.679
I don't know if it
was your puppy dog story

36:21.680 --> 36:24.383
or your boy scouty demeanor,

36:25.551 --> 36:28.953
or maybe the tan line on
your left ring finger,

36:28.954 --> 36:31.556
but something tells
me there's more to you

36:31.557 --> 36:33.091
than meets the eye, Brad.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.295
Fuck this.
Ah, ay, ay.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.830
That wouldn't be a good idea.

36:39.831 --> 36:40.799
Look, I don't know what kind

36:40.800 --> 36:42.166
of fucked up shit this is,

36:42.167 --> 36:44.235
but I don't want any part in it.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.403
Just let me go
and we can pretend

36:45.404 --> 36:46.837
this whole whole
thing never happened.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.854
Yeah, I knew he was packing.

37:03.855 --> 37:04.690
You can tell.

37:07.926 --> 37:08.760
Oh, shit.

37:11.062 --> 37:11.897
Well, come on.

37:15.634 --> 37:16.968
You gotta help me move him.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.975
Well are you gonna help
me move him or not?

37:26.978 --> 37:29.214
Do I have to do everything?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.604
When I get back,

37:53.739 --> 37:55.941
you and I are gonna talk
about your attitude.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.020
I'm gonna remember
this Zacharias.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.098
That's far enough.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.734
Now put your hands up.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.070
Keep 'em where I can see 'em.

38:26.071 --> 38:30.274
Now I want you to
slowly take out your gun

38:30.275 --> 38:31.909
and toss it over.

38:31.910 --> 38:32.911
Slowly.

38:36.214 --> 38:38.049
No sudden movements

38:39.451 --> 38:41.185
or I will shoot you.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.288
You know, I had you all wrong.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.723
I would have thought there
was a ruthless killer

38:45.724 --> 38:46.992
inside there somewhere,

38:48.927 --> 38:51.362
but you're just a
big, old softie.

38:51.363 --> 38:54.999
Yeah, well good
'cause coming from you,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.535
I'll take that as a compliment.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.969
And you know what?

38:58.970 --> 39:00.838
I changed my answer.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.141
You are officially my
worst passenger ever.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.312
You're not gonna
shoot me, are you?

39:08.313 --> 39:10.416
I'm not going to but I should.

39:11.717 --> 39:12.983
I'm calling the cops.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.351
If I were in your shoes,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.186
I would have shot
me 10 times by now.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.156
Yeah, well that's the
difference between you and I,

39:19.157 --> 39:20.459
I value human life.

39:34.272 --> 39:38.576
Alright, alright, if
you wanna call a cop,

39:38.577 --> 39:40.678
go ahead and call
the cops, okay?

39:40.679 --> 39:42.814
Here, use my phone.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.553
You might wanna look at
the photo gallery first.

39:57.863 --> 39:59.030
Oh, God, no.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.900
Did you really just think
you were some random driver

40:02.901 --> 40:04.836
at the wrong place
at the wrong time?

40:08.474 --> 40:09.707
Do you, do you remember
what you just said

40:09.708 --> 40:10.642
to me a minute ago?

40:11.677 --> 40:14.112
"I value human life."

40:20.519 --> 40:22.521
I was actually gonna let you go.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.922
Why?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.123
My daughter is innocent.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.626
So was my son.
Your son?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.761
I don't even know who you are.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.664
And yet I know
everything about you.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.699
I know you've been married

40:34.700 --> 40:37.968
to your wife Caroline
for 17 years.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.905
I know Angelique
is your only child.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.874
I know that when you're not
driving your car for money,

40:43.875 --> 40:46.712
you work at Atlantic
Prudential Insurance,

40:47.979 --> 40:50.516
and you decide who gets treated,

40:51.416 --> 40:53.852
who suffers, and who dies.

40:55.353 --> 40:56.154
What?

40:57.122 --> 40:58.222
What are you talking about?

40:58.223 --> 40:59.925
Jacob had leukemia.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.527
There was an
experimental treatment

41:02.528 --> 41:04.729
that could have saved his life.

41:04.730 --> 41:08.365
It was a combination of
two drugs already approved

41:08.366 --> 41:11.469
to treat certain
conditions other than his.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.507
Jacob had one treatment,

41:16.508 --> 41:21.513
and he showed
remarkable improvement.

41:23.749 --> 41:27.686
All he needed was just
11 more treatments,

41:31.322 --> 41:35.292
but the drugs weren't
approved for his condition.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.062
So you people
refused to cover it.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.537
I watched him suffer
and suffer and suffer.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.375
But you know what the kicker is?

41:54.479 --> 41:57.582
The drugs were approved
for treating leukemia

41:57.583 --> 42:00.886
less than six months
after my son died.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.790
Look, I'm sorry.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.025
I'm sorry about your son, man,

42:08.026 --> 42:09.628
but I had not control over that.

42:10.495 --> 42:12.597
I don't make those decisions.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.599
I have no authority there.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.667
There are tables and equations.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.604
My son was not an equation!

42:19.605 --> 42:21.138
Look, I'm sorry.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.907
I'm sorry about your boy,

42:22.908 --> 42:24.408
but my daughter is innocent.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.344
She had nothing to do with this.

42:28.313 --> 42:29.546
The sins of the father

42:29.547 --> 42:31.015
shall be visited
onto the children

42:31.016 --> 42:32.450
of those who hate the Lord.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.152
But you don't even
believe in the Lord.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.321
I believe in sin.

42:37.889 --> 42:42.360
Thomas, please,
tell me where she is?

42:44.896 --> 42:47.397
Your daughter is in
a hole so deep and dark

42:47.398 --> 42:48.933
that not even the
dogs will smell

42:48.934 --> 42:52.737
her rotting corpse after
she starves to death.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.777
But the good new is
you get to decide

42:59.778 --> 43:01.179
whether she lives or dies.

43:03.481 --> 43:06.184
You get to choose with that.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.689
Shoot me, she stays in her hole.

43:11.857 --> 43:13.290
Call the cops and turn me in,

43:13.291 --> 43:14.860
she stays in her hole.

43:17.863 --> 43:19.563
What if I shoot myself?

43:19.564 --> 43:20.866
Bingo.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.842
How do I know you'll let her go?

43:32.410 --> 43:37.181
Zacharias, do you have
any doubt in your heart

43:37.182 --> 43:39.651
or mind that I'm not
a man of my word?

43:45.556 --> 43:47.524
I'll tell you what,

43:47.525 --> 43:50.028
I'm gonna give you a little
time to think it over.

43:53.598 --> 43:54.900
You got two minutes.

45:45.110 --> 45:46.476
You must be my ride?

45:46.477 --> 45:48.312
Hey, I'm Chris, nice to meet ya.

45:48.313 --> 45:51.148
Thomas, nice to meet you, Chris.

45:51.149 --> 45:52.716
So where are you headed?
