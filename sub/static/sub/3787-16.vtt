00:01.335 --> 00:03.369
Here's your check.

00:03.371 --> 00:06.939
I didn't charge you for
the fries, 'cause I ate them.

00:06.941 --> 00:10.142
[drone propellers whirring]

00:13.280 --> 00:14.546
[gasps]
Max, look out!

00:14.548 --> 00:17.282
The diner water bugs
are getting really big.

00:17.284 --> 00:20.119
Relax, it's the diner's new
surveillance drone.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.254
God, you empty the register
five or ten times,

00:22.256 --> 00:24.289
suddenly there's no trust.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.562
So to be clear, we're out of
soap but we have a drone?

00:30.564 --> 00:33.365
I hate that Han's just sitting
in back, watching us,

00:33.367 --> 00:36.568
working his little joy stick.

00:36.570 --> 00:41.940
Please, no one's getting any joy
out of Han's little stick.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.909
This is so annoying.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.045
It's following me.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.080
Well, with a butt that flat,
it's the only black thing

00:48.082 --> 00:51.617
that's ever going to follow you.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.186
Ugh, there's another drone
out here?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.722
I just killed one in the kitchen
with a fly swatter.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.990
Go.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.625
I mean, if I wanted
to be spied on,

00:59.627 --> 01:01.126
I'd change my name
to Achmed,

01:01.128 --> 01:06.031
and buy a condo
near the airport.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.533
Whatever happened
to buying a painting

01:07.535 --> 01:09.968
of an old sea captain,
drilling out the eye holes,

01:09.970 --> 01:11.870
and hiding behind it?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.639
Not cool, Han.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.474
And the worst part is,
it's moving around so much,

01:15.476 --> 01:18.811
I can't find my good angle.

01:18.813 --> 01:21.080
Not cool and not Han.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.549
I stole this
while he was explaining to me

01:23.551 --> 01:26.952
why a 77-year-old man,
on minimum wage,

01:26.954 --> 01:29.588
doesn't need health care.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.223
Earl, that is awesome.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.626
Not really.
I need that health care.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.095
No, that you stole that.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.162
We need to do something
that will make Han

01:37.164 --> 01:39.932
never want to spy
on us again.

01:39.934 --> 01:43.168
Oleg, open your pants.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.972
Earl, fly that camera
in there.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.875
But first,
take off your underwear.

01:49.877 --> 01:54.179
Underwear?

01:54.181 --> 01:57.816
Come on.
What am I, five?

01:57.818 --> 01:59.885
Inches?

02:01.422 --> 02:05.324
Oleg, aren't you at all worried
about Earl's cataracts?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.960
Best case scenario,
I get a little manscaping.

02:07.962 --> 02:13.298
Worst case, I've been meaning
to get circumcised.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.801
[Han's screams]

02:15.803 --> 02:16.802

02:35.422 --> 02:37.289
Max, I'm writing out
the check for our bank loan,

02:37.291 --> 02:39.191
and I'm not quite sure
what our balance is

02:39.193 --> 02:44.763
because here under "withdrawals"
you just wrote, "yeah."

02:44.765 --> 02:46.798
Well, if you don't like that,
you're really not going to like

02:46.800 --> 02:48.700
the picture I drew
under "deposits."

02:50.171 --> 02:51.470
I saw it.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.772
Max, zeroes are not balls,
they're not boobs,

02:53.774 --> 02:58.510
and they're not googly eyes.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.779
They're just zeroes.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.182
Says you.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.050
I'll go check our balance
at the ATM.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.618
Even though the last guy
who touched it

03:06.620 --> 03:07.953
had a cold sore so big,

03:07.955 --> 03:10.088
I charged him
for a party of two.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.224
Don't worry. You are not
going to get anything

03:12.226 --> 03:13.392
from that machine.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.161
Especially cash.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.263
Hey, everybody.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.801
Oh, yeah.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.369
Somebody better make me
some eggs

03:24.371 --> 03:27.239
because I've been on
a juice cleanse for three hours,

03:27.241 --> 03:28.974
and I'm dizzy.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.043
Yeah.
I mean, they call it a fast,

03:31.045 --> 03:34.079
but it sure does go slow.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.815
I was on a three weeks fast,
once.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.886
Then I realized my mother
wasn't coming home.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.589
So I made a sandwich.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.524
Oleg and my wedding
is coming up

03:45.526 --> 03:48.660
and we're trying to eat clean.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.862
Yeah, baby, 'cause you know
we're eating dirty

03:50.864 --> 03:55.367
on the honeymoon.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.902
[screaming]

03:56.904 --> 03:59.204
Oh, dear God, what?

03:59.206 --> 04:02.741
Another used condom
in the receipt slot?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.443
- Worse.
- What?

04:04.445 --> 04:09.615
Stuff that should be
in a condom but isn't?

04:09.617 --> 04:12.017
We're below zero.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.887
Oh, well,
I better go, y'all.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.024
A white woman screaming
anywhere in my vicinity

04:19.026 --> 04:22.461
never turns out well.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.762
This is a disaster.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.063
I've been at zero,

04:25.065 --> 04:27.633
but I've never
had less than zero.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.234
Oh, don't say that, Caroline.

04:29.236 --> 04:33.839
I mean, you're forgetting
about your dating options.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.807
We have less than zero money

04:35.809 --> 04:38.710
and no way
of paying off our bank loan.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.512
Oh, my God.
It happened.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.282
I'm working class.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.784
Hey. I've waited tables
with you for four years

04:45.786 --> 04:48.553
and there's no way you could
call what you do working.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.959
Cupcakes!

04:53.961 --> 04:56.261
Buy cupcakes.

04:56.263 --> 04:59.665
Buy cupcakes!

04:59.667 --> 05:00.966
Stop.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.901
You look more desperate
than Justin Bieber

05:02.903 --> 05:06.872

05:06.874 --> 05:08.507
You don't understand
the seriousness

05:08.509 --> 05:10.142
of this bank situation.

05:10.144 --> 05:14.046
You don't understand the rules
of<i> World Of Warcraft.</i>

05:14.048 --> 05:16.648
The loan just keeps escalating
and escalating

05:16.650 --> 05:19.284
until they close us down.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.987
Cupcakes!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.291
Oh, Pay-dirt.
Look.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.827
Here comes a big, fat
frat house guy.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.796
Hey, bitches.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.597
Remember me?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.132
Big Mary.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.635
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.304
John, we haven't seen you
since pastry school.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.506
Hey, for old times' sake,
want to buy a cupcake?

05:41.508 --> 05:44.309
A dozen?
The shop?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.345
So I came because
I may know of a way

05:46.347 --> 05:48.280
for Max to make
some extra money.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.949
Whatever it is,
she'll do it.

05:50.951 --> 05:54.186
That was my yearbook quote.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.854
I just got hired
at a new restaurant

05:55.856 --> 05:57.022
that's opening
under the High Line Park

05:57.024 --> 05:58.957
in Manhattan,
and they are looking

05:58.959 --> 06:01.093
for another day pastry chef.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.195
I only have a year
of pastry school

06:03.197 --> 06:05.564
and I was stoned
for, like, a year of that.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.733
I don't know
if I have the skills.

06:07.735 --> 06:11.169
[chuckles]
Oh, girl, you don't.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.573
But the manager, Joe,
wants only pretty people.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.807
And what you lack in pastry,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.343
you more than make up
for in pretty.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.345
She'll do it.
You'll do it, Max.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.780
And John will be there
to help back you up

06:21.782 --> 06:23.048
with his pastry skills.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.084
And 'cause I'm pretty.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.253
I don't belong in a place
like that.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.755
It's called "The High."

06:29.757 --> 06:33.692
Sounds right.
Give me the deets.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.127
Well, good night girls.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.795
Sorry about your bank balance.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.063
But I trust you'll both lapse

06:38.065 --> 06:41.833
into denial fairly soon,
as always.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.235
Hello.

06:45.906 --> 06:50.208
Who was she?

06:50.210 --> 06:53.945
Hold me closer,
tiny dancer.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.017
Oh...Han's not gay.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.420
You forgot the "yet."

07:10.497 --> 07:12.030
Max, maybe button up
a button or two.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.699
It's a dessert bar.
Not a strip bar.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.768
Hey, I need this job,

07:16.770 --> 07:20.739
and once this Joe guy takes
one look at these puff pastries,

07:20.741 --> 07:22.174
he might cut me some slack
when he sees

07:22.176 --> 07:24.810
my other "not so puff"
pastries.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.012
And you're comfortable
with that?

07:27.014 --> 07:27.979
Yup.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.115
Like I guess
you're comfortable

07:30.117 --> 07:31.349
applying for a waitress job

07:31.351 --> 07:33.985
on just the merits
of your waitress skills.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.191
Should I keep going?

07:39.193 --> 07:41.092
Why?

07:41.094 --> 07:42.961
I'm here.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.430
I'll take those applications.
Hurry, ladies.

07:45.432 --> 07:49.768
If I was looking for pretty
and slow, I'd hire Nick Jonas.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.903
Max,
let's get out of here.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.872
She reminds me
of this nightmare

07:53.874 --> 07:55.941
I'm going to have
for the rest of my life.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.742
Relax, she's just
his guard dog.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.478
It's Joe guy
we have to impress.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.612
No thank you.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.113
No thank you.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.216
And how dare you?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.421
Oh, I'm sorry, the restaurant
doesn't open until tomorrow.

08:09.423 --> 08:10.856
Actually, no.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.358
Hi. I'm here to apply
for a waitress job.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.993
At your age?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.761
I'm 27!

08:16.763 --> 08:18.363
And?

08:18.365 --> 08:20.665
Max,
I can't breathe.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.869
And I'm here to apply
for a pastry chef.

08:23.871 --> 08:27.272
Also 27, but I've looked
this old since I was 6.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.609
For a while, I thought I had
that Benjamin Button's disease.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.911
I'll take the pastry chef
first.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.412
Why don't you sit over there
and wait.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.581
I won't be long,
because frankly,

08:36.583 --> 08:39.484
you don't have the time.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.586
Thank you.
I'll be over there.

08:41.588 --> 08:45.624
Applying for Social Security.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.792
So where did you go
to pastry school,

08:47.794 --> 08:49.661
and why aren't you
working now?

08:49.663 --> 08:52.130
Manhattan School Of Pastry,
and I am working.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.165
I have my own cupcake shop
in Brooklyn.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.334
Oh, it's almost over.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.702
This interview? Great.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.571
No. Not the interview.
Brooklyn.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.172
Brooklyn's almost over.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.709
Also, cupcakes.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.379
Cool. I will tell them.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.713
Wish I knew that
before they all got

09:08.715 --> 09:11.750
their belly buttons pierced
trying to stay cool.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.752
Oh, great.
A sense of humor.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.387
Customers love that.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.123
I don't, but they do.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.760
So, um, where's this Joe guy
who's doing the hiring?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.329
There is no "Joe guy."
I'm Joe.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.231
Spelled, J-O-E-D-T-H.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.067
The D-T-H is silent.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.170
As am I,
because I want this job.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.439
Well, I guess
I can put these away then.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.041
That was your plan?

09:36.043 --> 09:39.477
To expose your breasts and
seduce your way into this job?

09:39.479 --> 09:44.182
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.584
Okay.
Well, bye.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.252
Sit, sit.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.553
If you really can bake,

09:48.555 --> 09:50.455
this position might be
perfect for you.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.723
Also, you have that edgy,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.825
"I don't give a crap"
attitude.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.993
Customers love that.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.862
I don't, but they do.

09:57.864 --> 10:02.334
Actually, Joe, silent D-T-H,
I can bake.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.802
But how well?

10:03.804 --> 10:07.405
My girlfriend and I are
obsessed with French pastry.

10:07.407 --> 10:12.444
Oh. Girlfriend
as in "girlfriend,"

10:12.446 --> 10:13.878
or as in two ladies
of a certain age

10:13.880 --> 10:17.515
at a Cineplex
splitting one thing of popcorn?

10:17.517 --> 10:20.418
Everything you just said
offended me.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.488
Yeah, that's my brand.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.689
And the fact
that you didn't cry

10:24.691 --> 10:25.957
about splitting a popcorn
makes me think

10:25.959 --> 10:28.760
it's the first kind of
girlfriend.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.929
How are your macaroons?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.067
Uh...oh. Mm.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.871
My macaroons?

10:39.873 --> 10:42.907
Great.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.311
A little bit of French
heaven.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.146
What is your name?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.382
Max.

10:50.384 --> 10:53.652
M-a-x.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.453
[clicks teeth]

10:55.455 --> 10:57.989
Nothing is silent.
Ever.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.225
So I gather.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.228
Okay. Why don't you go
fill out an application, Max.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.863
And you can
put those away again.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.432
I'm really not
into big-breasted women.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.670
Girl, you got this.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.110
First day.
Are you nervous, girl?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.646
Please. Nervous is telling
your elderly Mormon parents

11:21.648 --> 11:23.715
that you're gay
after your three older siblings

11:23.717 --> 11:26.818
already came out.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.554
I have no idea what most
of these desserts are.

11:29.556 --> 11:33.525
I haven't felt this lost
since the finale of<i> Lost.</i>

11:33.527 --> 11:36.828
Max, can you see any of the
Barney's price tags on these?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.996
Uh, I think there's one
bunching up

11:37.998 --> 11:39.497
inside the back
of your pants.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.834
No, that's the underwear
I'm also returning.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.769
Here she comes.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.571
Hi, ladies.
This is Naomi,

11:46.573 --> 11:48.273
the dessert bar hostess.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.041
Go, Naomi, go.

11:51.712 --> 11:57.982
Gorgeous, but as dumb as whoever
is the hot new idiot right now.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.719
Let me take a look at you.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.754
Good-bye.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.589
Already?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.958
Those pearls.
They have to go.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.259
Really? It's just, well,

12:08.261 --> 12:10.495
I'm kind of emotionally attached
to them.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.031
Well, honey, I love
my half-blind French bulldog,

12:13.033 --> 12:16.334
but I don't wear her
around my neck.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.603
Max, let me take a look.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.604
Love it.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.940
Fabulous.
Well done.

12:21.942 --> 12:25.143
Hi, Joe. Big day.
I'm so excited.

12:25.145 --> 12:29.013
Why don't you be excited
in the back, doll?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.782
I want Max up front now.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.718
All my life, people have been
telling me not to come out.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.388
Why should here
be any different?

12:37.390 --> 12:41.159
Ladies, I just got word that
the<i> New York Times</i> food critic

12:41.161 --> 12:44.162
may make a surprise visit
this afternoon.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.164
Everything
has to be perfect--

12:46.166 --> 12:47.832
the service,
the desserts,

12:47.834 --> 12:50.869
the precarious balance
of my meds.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.304
Nothing can go wrong.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.773
Naomi.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.441
Fetch.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.612
"Welcome to The High."

13:00.614 --> 13:02.614
"Hi. Welcome to The High."

13:02.616 --> 13:03.915
"Welcome to The High."

13:03.917 --> 13:08.253
Stop saying high.
It reminds me I'm not.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.388
Wait, Max,
you're not high?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.157
Like, not high at all?

13:12.159 --> 13:15.426
No. I didn't want
to screw today up.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.329
What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.899
You can't change
who you are today.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.900
The<i> New York Times</i>
is coming.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.434
How will you cope?

13:23.436 --> 13:26.504
I mean, when's the last time
you weren't high?

13:26.506 --> 13:29.073
My birth.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.742
But I was really drunk.

13:30.744 --> 13:33.044
I had just had
a bottle of wine.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.079
Well, my mother had.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.414
I have to go wait
on those customers.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.982
Do what you can
to get with the program.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.851
I mean, get off
the program.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.555
You can't bake not baked.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.156
Big Mary?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.124
John?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.892
Why not try my new name?

13:47.894 --> 13:50.428
Quasimodo.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.763
Do you have any weed?

13:51.765 --> 13:53.531
Do I have any weed?

13:53.533 --> 13:56.401
Let me check my hump.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.470
Nope.
No weed.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.206
Thanks, Rico.
I didn't want to ask

14:01.208 --> 14:03.374
due to the city-wide ban
on racial profiling.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.812
Wow.
This dish room is cleaner

14:07.814 --> 14:12.150
than Chris Christie's plate
after lunch.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.052
Max, I need two lavender
macaroons.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.054
- Where are they?
- I'm working on them.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.857
Well, good.
I'm so proud of you.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.593
This is so<i> Freaky Friday.</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:26.197
Here are the lavender macaroons.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.200
See? Even just holding this,
I'm better.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.769
Now we just have to hope
nothing goes wrong.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.171
(Sophie)
Surprise!

14:38.011 --> 14:41.012
We all came to support you.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.254
(Caroline)
Well, that's it.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.855
The<i> New York Times</i> food critic
may be in the same room

14:50.857 --> 14:53.424
as Han, Earl,
Oleg, and Sophie.

14:53.426 --> 14:57.395
We're dead.
Time of death, 11:30.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.797
I believe it's more like 4:20.

15:02.636 --> 15:06.537
Oh, Caroline,
I love your new place.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.940
It's so fresh and pretty.

15:08.942 --> 15:13.378
It kind of looks like
a douche commercial.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.746
You're right, baby.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.782
It looks exactly like
a douche commercial.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.652
Okay.
Can we stop saying "douche"

15:20.654 --> 15:22.453
in the fancy pastry shop?

15:22.455 --> 15:25.490
I agree.
Not appropriate.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.926
Caroline, darling,
slip my phone number

15:27.928 --> 15:30.862
to that fine Nubian
princess.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.131
And tell her not to be
fooled by my bad hip.

15:33.133 --> 15:37.936
I can still gently
rock her world.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.771
Okay, guys,
what are you doing here

15:39.773 --> 15:41.572
and how quickly can you leave?

15:41.574 --> 15:42.674
Real nice.

15:42.676 --> 15:43.808
After we came all this way

15:43.810 --> 15:45.476
to just order only desserts

15:45.478 --> 15:46.844
that Max knows how to make

15:46.846 --> 15:49.747
and to say nice things
about you as a waitress.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.716
Oh, you'd do that for me?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.851
Hell no,
I can't pull that off.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.188
If I could act,
I'd sell the restaurant

15:57.190 --> 15:59.691
and get cast in two-line roles
as the doctor

15:59.693 --> 16:03.161
on any network television show.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.429
Sophie's the actress.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.298
And trust me,
she's got quite a repertoire.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.600
In bed, I call her Meryl Sheets.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.569
Do it, baby.

16:14.007 --> 16:19.344
[Southern Belle accent]
Oh, what a lovely place.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.579
That's the accent she uses
when we play

16:21.581 --> 16:23.881
"12 Years A Sex Slave."

16:26.653 --> 16:27.986
Lovely, be right back.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.321
Oh, and, welcome to The High.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.057
(Joedth)
What's going on
with that table?

16:33.059 --> 16:35.893
Is there a European circus
in town?

16:35.895 --> 16:38.029
A circus?
Well, I wouldn't know.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.731
I really have no idea
who they are.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.100
That didn't require an answer.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.436
It was just one
of my dead-on observations.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.005
Just get rid of them.

16:47.007 --> 16:52.910
Tell them we've run out
of funnel cakes.

16:52.912 --> 16:57.382
Well, I'm feeling like
my old self.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.084
Joe just told me to lose Han,
Earl, Oleg, and Sophie.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.453
How am I supposed to
lose that many people?

17:02.455 --> 17:04.856
I'm not air traffic control.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.724
You are acting like
they don't know how to act

17:06.726 --> 17:08.659
in a fancy place.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.461
[Sophie, yelling]
Girls, look!

17:10.463 --> 17:14.165
Oleg's wearing
his napkin as a party hat.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.168
[Sophie laughing]

17:19.739 --> 17:22.140
Here's your dessert.
Bon appetite.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.609
Max, I can't believe
you just made that.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.744
Neither can I.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.913
And what did you say
to Oleg and Sophie?

17:28.915 --> 17:30.748
It's been an hour,
and I haven't seen

17:30.750 --> 17:33.151
any over-the-table
penetration.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.653
I just told them
to be on their best behavior,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.488
and they're fine with it.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.257
Excuse me, Max.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.391
Yes, hi.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.993
May I go tinkle?

17:41.995 --> 17:46.264
Or is that against the law here
at Guantanamo Dessert Bay?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.966
I'm gonna go have sex
in the ladies room.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.136
Unless you two prudes
have a problem with that, too.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.606
Excuse me.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.808
Can I get a latte
and a red wine?

17:56.810 --> 17:58.276
[clears throat]

17:58.278 --> 18:01.079
'Cause I got a Vicodin
stuck in my throat.

18:03.817 --> 18:04.882
Oh, my God.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.117
Who could be that messed up

18:06.119 --> 18:07.852
in the middle
of the afternoon?

18:07.854 --> 18:11.622
Uh, my new best friend.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.524
I better get rid of her
before Joe

18:13.526 --> 18:15.293
or that<i> Times</i> critic
walks in.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.529
You keep doing good things
by accident.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.831
Hi, can I get a--

18:19.833 --> 18:21.532
You sure can.
Anywhere but here.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.669
(woman)
Oh, no. Spinning's not good
for me right now.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.039
(Joedth)
What is she doing here?

18:28.041 --> 18:29.407
Leaving.
You never saw her.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.942
- Wait--
- Joe, I got this.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.343
My bestie at school
was totally hooked

18:32.345 --> 18:34.579
on prescription pills
for, like, a week.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.014
Hey, hi, you.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.084
Excuse me.
Where is Max?

18:40.086 --> 18:41.385
She's in the back
for a sec.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.854
So...

18:42.856 --> 18:44.789
We meet again.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.125
Sir, do you need something
in the back?

18:47.127 --> 18:49.560
Yes, Caroline said
she'd bring me a napkin,

18:49.562 --> 18:54.398
but I could get Time Warner
on the phone faster than that.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.633
Just ask Max.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.403
She covers for Caroline
all the time at the diner.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.572
Max?

19:01.574 --> 19:04.809
Ooh.
Drama at The High.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.777
Han,
that's my new boss.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.379
Stop talking.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.849
Also, stop collecting stickers.
You're a grown-up.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.019
Okay, I threw that drug addict
out.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.989
That drug addict
is my girlfriend.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.358
More drama at The High.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.627
And Caroline,
we have a problem.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.362
You called Allie
a drug addict.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.496
Oh, is that her name?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.797
Allie?
So cute.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.766
Even lovelier.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.735
And according
to that very small man,

19:30.737 --> 19:33.971
you're also
a terrible waitress.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.074
But I had no idea
you two were together.

19:37.076 --> 19:40.611
I would have thought
a powerful...

19:40.613 --> 19:43.214
Stop. Now.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.150
Joe, look, we really need
these jobs.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.286
We made a bad decision
with our bakery business,

19:48.288 --> 19:51.656
and we have a big bank loan
that we can't pay.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.990
Honesty.
Good.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.992
People respond
to honesty.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.929
I don't, but they do.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.430
Max, you have potential here.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.099
Caroline,
you're fired as a waitress.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.102
Are you sure?

20:05.104 --> 20:06.204
Stop!

20:09.709 --> 20:12.376
There's nothing in there
to save you.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.048
Well, if she's fired,
I'm fired, too.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.317
Oh, relax,
Norma Rae.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.185
She's fired
as a waitress,

20:21.187 --> 20:23.287
but she's hired
as a hostess.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.957
I am?
Why?

20:25.959 --> 20:27.925
Because you're pretty,
you flashed a boob,

20:27.927 --> 20:30.595
and you took more control
of Allie in five minutes

20:30.597 --> 20:34.065
than anybody's been able to do
in her three rehab stints.

20:34.067 --> 20:38.469
And that, lady,
is a New York City hostess.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.610
Well, girls, I struck out.

20:45.612 --> 20:50.181
Bill Cosby has ruined it
for all black men over 70

20:50.183 --> 20:54.085
who are just trying
to buy a gal a drink.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.957
Max, how do you like that?

20:59.959 --> 21:02.193
I'm the hostess.
I got a promotion!

21:02.195 --> 21:03.694
I don't think
a hostess is a promo--

21:03.696 --> 21:06.130
It is, Max, 'cause with a
less-than-zero bank balance,

21:06.132 --> 21:07.932
it has to be.
It's all I have left.
