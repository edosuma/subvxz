WEBVTT

00:08.797 --> 00:14.049
Well, Charlie, here we are in our
hotel room, and we're not on vacation.

00:14.050 --> 00:19.058
Confused? Well, get comfortable,
because it's a doozy.

00:19.059 --> 00:20.261
( Pounds )

00:20.262 --> 00:22.129
Charlie, get out of the bathroom!

00:22.130 --> 00:24.686
Charlie: In a minute!

00:24.687 --> 00:27.987
Hey. Come on, guys. Huh?

00:28.036 --> 00:30.684
Not so bad. Kind of an adventure.

00:30.685 --> 00:32.380
- Oh, save it.
- Be quiet! Shut up.

00:32.381 --> 00:34.655
Come on. I'm just trying
to make the best of it.

00:34.656 --> 00:37.432
- Because you caused it.
- Not totally my fault.

00:37.433 --> 00:40.268
- Then whose fault was it?
- I'll get back to you on that.

00:40.269 --> 00:43.116
Ugh. Teddy, I need a hand.

00:43.117 --> 00:45.706
So how we got here is
kind of a long story.

00:45.707 --> 00:49.344
Let's just say this is the worst
day in Duncan family history.

00:49.345 --> 00:52.402
- Amy: Teddy, now!
- I'm coming!

00:52.403 --> 00:54.285
( Sighs )

00:54.286 --> 00:56.986
To be continued.

01:03.659 --> 01:06.773
( Softly ) Oh. You hear that, Toby?

01:06.774 --> 01:08.709
It's called quiet.

01:08.710 --> 01:11.845
Enjoy it while you can, because
in this house it doesn't last long.

01:11.846 --> 01:15.506
- Gabe: Mom!
- Hmm? Told you.

01:16.484 --> 01:19.853
- Why is Toby's crib in my room?
- Because you two are sharing a room now.

01:19.854 --> 01:22.195
- We talked about this.
- No, we didn't.

01:22.196 --> 01:27.374
We didn't? Oh, well, Toby and
I talked, and he's fine with it.

01:27.375 --> 01:31.094
I... I can't share a room with a baby.
I'm a teenager now. I need my own space.

01:31.095 --> 01:34.219
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but
we only have so many rooms.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.652
Besides, you love Toby.

01:35.653 --> 01:39.410
This isn't about love. This
is about square footage.

01:39.411 --> 01:41.414
Well, if it makes it any easier,

01:41.415 --> 01:44.376
Toby's about the same age you
were when you moved in with P.J.

01:44.377 --> 01:48.501
Yeah, but with me and P.J., the
little brother was in charge.

01:48.502 --> 01:51.398
That ain't happening with us.

01:51.399 --> 01:54.819
Oh... aren't you adorable?

01:55.523 --> 01:59.123
Stop that, Gabe! Stay strong.

02:59.406 --> 03:01.485

tell me what you think?

03:01.486 --> 03:03.406
Sure.

03:07.044 --> 03:08.056
( Clears throat )

03:08.057 --> 03:09.977
Um...

03:09.992 --> 03:12.392
What is it?

03:13.441 --> 03:14.944
Well, that's not a good question.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.479
It's New England clam chowder.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.550
Ah. Well, I'm not getting any chowder...

03:22.551 --> 03:24.485
Or clams.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.554
Or even England.

03:26.555 --> 03:29.435
It is new, though.

03:29.825 --> 03:31.660
Oh man!

03:31.661 --> 03:34.453
I wanted to make Spencer a
special welcome-home lunch.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.497
He was visiting BIPA.

03:36.498 --> 03:39.600
BIPA, the Boston Institute
of Performing Arts.

03:39.601 --> 03:42.007
- He's hoping to go there next Fall.
- ( Doorbell rings )

03:42.008 --> 03:45.540
There he is. Hey, um, do you
think you could rescue this?

03:45.541 --> 03:48.961
- No problem.
- Thank you.

03:49.001 --> 03:51.221
Step one.

03:54.515 --> 03:58.152
Oh! I'm so glad you're home.

03:58.153 --> 04:00.858
- So how was BIPA?
- Supa.

04:00.859 --> 04:02.971
It's how they say "super" in Boston.

04:02.972 --> 04:08.086
I know. Hey, you wanna hear how they
say, "go park your car in Harvard Yard"?

04:08.087 --> 04:11.666
"Pahk your cah in hahvahd yahd".

04:11.667 --> 04:14.307
( Laughs ) Supa.

04:14.634 --> 04:17.180
( Laughs ) Mine's better.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.963
So hey, how was it?

04:18.964 --> 04:21.482
Oh my gosh, the school is amazing.

04:21.483 --> 04:23.657
- I mean, I loved it.
- That's awesome.

04:23.658 --> 04:26.323
So when do you find out if you got in?

04:26.324 --> 04:28.449
I already found out.

04:28.450 --> 04:29.836
They accepted me.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.450
Way to go, boyfriend!

04:31.451 --> 04:34.511
<i>♪ Oh yeah, uh-huh.</i>

04:35.237 --> 04:37.759
Why am I the only one
doing a happy dance?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.695
Well, because... because
there's one other thing.

04:40.696 --> 04:43.431
Um, they want me to
start a little early.

04:43.432 --> 04:45.268
Well, like how early?

04:45.269 --> 04:47.304
Monday.

04:47.305 --> 04:49.482
- What?
- Yeah, it's called early enrollment.

04:49.483 --> 04:53.257
They have a space available and if I
want it, I have to take it right now.

04:53.258 --> 04:55.803
But you haven't finished high school.

04:55.804 --> 04:59.336
Yeah, I know, but I already
have enough credits to graduate.

04:59.337 --> 05:01.197
Wow.

05:01.202 --> 05:03.482
This is...

05:04.242 --> 05:06.102
Wow.

05:07.284 --> 05:09.715
Hey, Teddy...

05:09.716 --> 05:13.274
I haven't made my decision yet. I
mean, I wanted to talk to you first.

05:13.275 --> 05:15.869
What do you think?

05:15.870 --> 05:18.833
I don't know. I'm just kind of in shock.

05:18.834 --> 05:22.069
- Yeah, me too.
- ( Footsteps )

05:22.070 --> 05:27.970
Who's ready for some delicious
New England chicken noodle chowder?

05:28.296 --> 05:30.816
Denver Omelet?

05:37.597 --> 05:40.909
Guys, guys, I had an
unbelievable day at work.

05:40.910 --> 05:42.556
Wait until I tell you what happened.

05:42.557 --> 05:45.073
Oh, I think I hear Toby.

05:45.074 --> 05:48.295
- Baby's right there.
- ( Coos )

05:48.296 --> 05:51.699
- Oh, then I think I hear Charlie.
- Charlie's at a play date.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.683
( Whispers ) I'm trying to get out
of a bug story, work with me here.

05:54.684 --> 05:58.739
Okay. So I'm doing a routine
spray job over at the Andersons'...

05:58.740 --> 06:02.427
They have a monthly maintenance package,
so that means I go every other Tuesday.

06:02.428 --> 06:05.499
So the first Tuesday is perimeter,
the second Tuesday's interior.

06:05.500 --> 06:10.311
- I think I hear the doorbell.
- Oh no, you don't.

06:10.312 --> 06:12.858
Anyway, long story short...

06:12.859 --> 06:14.952
- I captured these bad boys.
- Ugh.

06:14.953 --> 06:16.357
Huh?

06:16.358 --> 06:19.036
Brazilian termites.

06:19.037 --> 06:23.978
Very rare, very destructive and they've
never been found in North America...

06:23.979 --> 06:26.259
Until now.

06:26.535 --> 06:30.538
Well, if they're so destructive, why
would you bring them into our house?

06:30.539 --> 06:32.747
Our wooden house?

06:32.748 --> 06:34.748
Honey, I'm not an idiot.

06:34.749 --> 06:37.290
This container... termite-proof.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.850
- Are you sure?
- I am sure.

06:39.851 --> 06:41.922
Besides, it's only
gonna be for one night.

06:41.923 --> 06:45.386
Tomorrow I'm taking 'em to
the University of Denver.

06:45.387 --> 06:49.582
( Laughs ) This could land me
in the exterminator hall of fame.

06:49.583 --> 06:53.103
Bob honey, that doesn't exist.

06:53.104 --> 06:57.174
Honey, yes, it does. It's in Detroit.

06:57.175 --> 07:01.003
Used to be in Cleveland,
but they had to move it.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.404
Rat problem.

07:08.543 --> 07:10.357
So I know that it's a great opportunity,

07:10.358 --> 07:13.547
but if Spencer leaves
now, I'm gonna be so sad.

07:13.548 --> 07:16.227
We have so many plans
for the rest of the year.

07:16.228 --> 07:20.454
When I get a boyfriend, we're
gonna make bunch of plans too.

07:20.455 --> 07:22.590
Maybe you should make a
plan to get a boyfriend.

07:22.591 --> 07:26.442
Maybe you should make a plan
not to tell me to make a plan.

07:26.443 --> 07:28.874
Volleyball friends, huh?

07:28.875 --> 07:32.367
Well, one problem at a time.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.469
So Spencer asked me what
I thought he should do...

07:35.470 --> 07:37.471
And I don't know what to tell him.

07:37.472 --> 07:39.507
I think if you're lucky
enough to get a boyfriend,

07:39.508 --> 07:41.509
you should never ever let him go...

07:41.510 --> 07:46.091
Even if you have to lock him in
the basement and not tell anybody.

07:46.092 --> 07:48.012
So...

07:49.069 --> 07:52.156
Of course I don't want Spencer to go,

07:52.157 --> 07:55.523
but I also don't want to be
the one to keep him from going.

07:55.524 --> 07:59.125
Oh man. I wish I had some
experience with these things,

07:59.126 --> 08:03.431
but for some reason boys
find me weird and off-putting.

08:03.432 --> 08:06.612
Not just boys, sweetie.

08:06.894 --> 08:09.211
Kelsey, what do you think?

08:09.212 --> 08:11.990
I think whatever happens
is gonna be great.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.942
But if Spencer goes, then
Teddy will be crushed.

08:14.943 --> 08:17.678
- You make a good point.
- And if he doesn't go,

08:17.679 --> 08:21.349
- he might be miserable.
- That's a good point, too.

08:21.350 --> 08:23.684
So what are you saying?

08:23.685 --> 08:25.686
That I agree with everybody.

08:25.687 --> 08:27.822
But you can't agree with everybody.

08:27.823 --> 08:30.425
You are absolutely right.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.625
You just did it again!

08:31.626 --> 08:33.760
Okay, I've made my decision.

08:33.761 --> 08:38.261
- What is it?
- I need some new friends.

08:41.403 --> 08:44.525
My little Deedee just loves
playing with your little Charlie.

08:44.526 --> 08:46.101
Oh.

08:46.102 --> 08:50.544
Although, last time she asked me,
"why does Charlie have a boy's name?"

08:50.545 --> 08:54.745
And I didn't know what to tell her.

08:55.899 --> 08:58.797
Hey, honey. How's your play date going?

08:58.798 --> 09:01.161
- Eh.
- Mmm.

09:01.162 --> 09:04.256
Follow up question: Where's Deedee?

09:04.257 --> 09:06.417
In jail.

09:07.194 --> 09:10.498
Final question: What
does "jail" mean exactly?

09:10.499 --> 09:13.831
Uh, well, it means,
we'd better go check.

09:13.832 --> 09:15.692
Mmm.

09:16.605 --> 09:18.706
( Gasps ) Oh, my.

09:18.707 --> 09:22.477
- Oh. Oh, Deedee.
- ( Amy laughs )

09:22.478 --> 09:25.613
- Not funny.
- Oh, sorry.

09:25.614 --> 09:28.191
- Oh.
- Yeah, you guys go play.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.628
Maybe we should just stay in
here with the girls for a while.

09:30.629 --> 09:34.140
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Okay, sure.

09:34.141 --> 09:39.460
Well, at least this will
make a good post for my blog.

09:39.461 --> 09:41.662
Uh, you have a blog?

09:41.663 --> 09:45.566
I call it "Mama Debbie's Daily Doing's".

09:45.567 --> 09:48.327
( Laughs ) Oh my.

09:48.603 --> 09:51.138
Oh, you're serious.

09:51.139 --> 09:52.806
You betcha.

09:52.807 --> 09:56.480
I post recipes, offer helpful hints...

09:56.481 --> 10:00.994
Share fun things Doug
Dooley and I do together.

10:00.995 --> 10:04.956
Just passing along some of the things
I've learned about motherhood and such.

10:04.957 --> 10:10.724
Wow, and you've based this on your
vast experience with one child?

10:10.725 --> 10:15.165
And one on the way for a total of two.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.766
Oh. I have a total of five.

10:18.767 --> 10:22.007
It's not a competition.

10:22.309 --> 10:25.549
( Seriously ) It wasn't.

10:32.581 --> 10:36.127
- What are you doing down here?
- Toby kept me up all night.

10:36.128 --> 10:38.955
Ah. It's called payback.

10:38.956 --> 10:42.036
When you were a baby, you used
to make my life miserable, too.

10:42.037 --> 10:46.494
I will never forget the night I woke
up in your crib and you were in my bed.

10:46.495 --> 10:50.288
I still have no idea how you did that.

10:50.289 --> 10:53.667
Well, me and Toby sharing
a room is not gonna work.

10:53.668 --> 10:56.537
Something has to be done... now.

10:56.538 --> 10:59.474
Oh! Are you gonna do something bad?

10:59.475 --> 11:01.305
Because that'd be great...

11:01.306 --> 11:04.505
- For me.
- What are you talking about?

11:04.506 --> 11:07.352
Well, I have to break some
difficult news to mom and dad,

11:07.353 --> 11:08.782
and they're not gonna be happy.

11:08.783 --> 11:11.403
So I was thinking maybe
if you got in trouble,

11:11.404 --> 11:16.065
I could sneak my news in and
kind of piggyback on your badness.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.403
Well, what's the news?

11:18.404 --> 11:21.032
Oh, it's nothing.

11:21.033 --> 11:24.732
You know, I'd get it out of
you, but I am way too tired.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.634
So what do you think?

11:26.635 --> 11:29.470
You gonna be getting
into trouble anytime soon?

11:29.471 --> 11:31.783
I don't know. It's different.

11:31.784 --> 11:33.912
I'm a teenager now.

11:33.913 --> 11:37.905
Well, what kind of attitude is that?

11:37.906 --> 11:40.966
That is quitter talk.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.347
Brazilian termites.

11:46.348 --> 11:47.788
This is the most exciting thing

11:47.789 --> 11:51.454
since I discovered those
Ukrainian grub worms in '06.

11:51.455 --> 11:53.827
Excuse me, I discovered those.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.348
No, I was in the crawl space.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.732
You were in the port-a-john.

11:58.733 --> 12:00.701
Fine. Here.

12:00.702 --> 12:03.519
Feast your eyes on
those little beauties.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.950
I don't see 'em.

12:04.951 --> 12:06.918
- Well, they're in there.
- Are you sure?

12:06.919 --> 12:08.796
All I see are two little holes.

12:08.797 --> 12:10.605
Holes?!

12:10.606 --> 12:12.021
Oh no.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.544
No no no! They ate right
through the plastic!

12:15.545 --> 12:19.745
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

12:19.897 --> 12:23.433
Okay, look, we gotta wipe 'em
out before they multiply...

12:23.434 --> 12:26.095
More importantly, before Amy finds out.

12:26.096 --> 12:28.577
Well, we could tent the place.

12:28.578 --> 12:29.923
Hey, there you go.

12:29.924 --> 12:34.270
She'll never notice a giant
gas-filled tarp covering the house.

12:34.271 --> 12:37.496
Well, then what are we gonna do?

12:37.497 --> 12:39.413
I've got an idea.

12:39.414 --> 12:42.294
To the bug mobile!

12:42.344 --> 12:45.764
I love when he does that.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.897
Hey, sweetie, can you go get me
the jail? Mommy needs to do laundry.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.293
- Okay.
- Thank you, sweetie.

12:57.294 --> 12:59.313
Hi, Charlie. Hey, mom.

12:59.314 --> 13:00.771
- Hey, sweetie.
- What you doing?

13:00.772 --> 13:02.839
Working on my mommy blog.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.041
Mommy blog? That doesn't sound like you.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.635
I am gonna kick Debbie Dooley's butt.

13:07.636 --> 13:10.576
That sounds like you.

13:10.782 --> 13:13.755
The only problem is I'm having
trouble coming up with topics.

13:13.756 --> 13:15.461
What kind of stuff
does Debbie post about?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.955
- Recipes...
- Ooh, so that's out.

13:18.956 --> 13:24.559
She also writes about fun stuff she
does with her husband, so that's out too.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.863
Hey, where is Gabe? He's
always up to something?

13:26.864 --> 13:28.957
Well, here's hoping.

13:28.958 --> 13:32.467
I mean for you and your blog.

13:32.468 --> 13:34.381
Not for me. ( Scoffs )

13:34.382 --> 13:38.298
Why would I need him to do anything bad?

13:38.299 --> 13:40.339
Coming!

13:48.653 --> 13:50.654
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.055
- So listen, I...
- So, Teddy, I...

13:52.056 --> 13:55.476
- You first.
- Okay, um...

13:56.026 --> 13:59.696
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

13:59.697 --> 14:02.833
I think you should go to Boston.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.634
Oh.

14:04.645 --> 14:07.838
Because I was kinda
leaning towards not going.

14:07.839 --> 14:10.803
- Why?
- I just don't think I can leave you.

14:10.804 --> 14:14.147
Oh, Spence, but BIPA
is your dream school.

14:14.148 --> 14:16.323
It's the best music
program in the country

14:16.324 --> 14:18.249
and you know if you don't
grab this opportunity,

14:18.250 --> 14:20.252
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

14:20.253 --> 14:22.121
Yeah, but it's not the
only college out there.

14:22.122 --> 14:26.068
I mean, I could stay here and audition for
the Denver Institute of Performing Arts.

14:26.069 --> 14:28.709
- DIPA?
- Yeah.

14:29.252 --> 14:31.038
DIPA's not as good as BIPA.

14:31.039 --> 14:33.806
Oh yeah? You know who went to DIPA?

14:33.807 --> 14:36.358
- Kelly Ripa.
- Ripa went to DIPA?

14:36.359 --> 14:40.226
No, I just wanted to hear you say that.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.365
Hey, you know you have to do this.

14:43.366 --> 14:44.990
Yeah, but what about us?

14:44.991 --> 14:49.588
Well, there will still be an
us, just a long-distance us.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.158
- You really think we can make that work?
- Hey, nothing is far away anymore.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.596
We can... we can text.

14:55.597 --> 14:58.242
We can talk on the
phone. We can video chat.

14:58.243 --> 14:59.548
We can email.

14:59.549 --> 15:03.015
Oh, and the great part is
that when I smell funny...

15:03.016 --> 15:04.388
You won't have a clue.

15:04.389 --> 15:08.769
- Hey, you never smell funny.
- I know.

15:13.396 --> 15:16.298
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. We can do this.

15:16.299 --> 15:19.539
Yeah, of course we can.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.821
So when do you have to leave?

15:22.822 --> 15:24.862
Well...

15:25.523 --> 15:27.683
Tomorrow.

15:28.642 --> 15:30.562
Okay.

15:30.698 --> 15:33.338
Then come here.

15:35.748 --> 15:40.158
Until tomorrow, I'm
not gonna let you go.

15:40.159 --> 15:41.885
Me neither.

15:41.886 --> 15:44.106
( Grunts )

15:45.328 --> 15:47.877
Hey, it's kinda cold out
here. You wanna go inside?

15:47.878 --> 15:49.298
Sure.

15:49.299 --> 15:52.359
( Shuffling footsteps )

15:57.283 --> 16:00.943
Okay, my hungry little ants...

16:01.670 --> 16:05.270
Today's special is Brazilian.

16:05.359 --> 16:07.369
Bon Appetit.

16:07.370 --> 16:09.830
- Dad?
- Ow!

16:11.790 --> 16:15.826
- P.J.!
- Why are you releasing ants in the house?

16:15.827 --> 16:18.347
Uh, because...

16:18.931 --> 16:20.878
I'm training.

16:20.879 --> 16:26.234
Uh, I'm uh, letting the ants go
now so I can catch 'em again later.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.304
All the exterminators do it.

16:29.305 --> 16:34.309
Dad, do you think it's fair to
say I'm not the brightest Duncan?

16:34.310 --> 16:38.150
It... it's more than fair, son.

16:38.381 --> 16:42.137
So if I'm not buying this
story, who do you think will?

16:42.138 --> 16:44.075
( Sighs )

16:44.076 --> 16:47.196
All right, look, um...

16:48.224 --> 16:50.358
Those Brazilian termites
that I brought home?

16:50.359 --> 16:53.361
- Mm hmm.
- They got out, so I brought in some ants,

16:53.362 --> 16:57.927
because the ants will eat the
termites. See? So it's gonna be fine.

16:57.928 --> 17:01.408
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.694
Why don't you just tent the house?

17:03.695 --> 17:05.880
Because I don't want
your mom to find out.

17:05.881 --> 17:08.276
Because if mom found out, that'd be bad.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.451
That would be very bad.

17:10.452 --> 17:12.180
But she's not gonna find out.

17:12.181 --> 17:13.777
Right, right.

17:13.778 --> 17:17.707
Uh, but when she does,
could you let me know?

17:17.708 --> 17:20.828
- Why?
- Just because.

17:21.191 --> 17:22.367
( Scoffs )

17:22.367 --> 17:25.260
It's not like I have something to hide.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.300
Coming!

17:29.000 --> 17:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:39.008 --> 17:42.548
- Hello?
- Gabe: It's open!

17:45.414 --> 17:48.577
- What is this?
- It's my new room.

17:48.578 --> 17:51.035
No, it's not.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.700
Then what's my bed doing here?

17:53.701 --> 17:56.685
Gabe, you are not taking
over the living room.

17:56.686 --> 17:59.439
It's not the living room.
It's the fireplace area.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.720
Oh yeah, that makes
me feel better Gabe...

18:01.721 --> 18:04.901
With fire in his room.

18:06.104 --> 18:08.804
Now pack it up!

18:09.033 --> 18:13.833
That's what I get for
answering the curtain.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.841
It's so good to see your face.

18:18.842 --> 18:22.267
I know it's only been a few
days, but I miss you so much.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.806
Oh, I miss you too.

18:23.807 --> 18:26.644
And I'm sorry we haven't been
able to talk very much it's just...

18:26.645 --> 18:28.879
With orientation and everything...

18:28.880 --> 18:30.871
It's okay. I get it.

18:30.872 --> 18:34.475
Amy: Teddy, can you
give me a hand with Toby?

18:34.476 --> 18:37.056
Be right back.

18:37.888 --> 18:41.908
- ( Yawns ) Morning, honey.
- Hello.

18:48.221 --> 18:52.121
- Spencer: Hey, Mr. Duncan.
- Oh!

18:52.836 --> 18:56.605
Spencer? What are you
doing on the computer?

18:56.606 --> 18:57.873
Oh, just video-chatting.

18:57.874 --> 19:00.874
Hey, how about that?

19:01.892 --> 19:04.950
You see the butt scratch?

19:04.951 --> 19:06.849
Yes, Sir.

19:06.850 --> 19:08.194
I had an itch.

19:08.195 --> 19:10.372
Oh no, I completely
understand. It's just...

19:10.373 --> 19:13.910
Well, after the scratch
you picked up an apple.

19:13.911 --> 19:17.031
Then you put it back.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.494
Well, yeah, I just...

19:19.495 --> 19:22.865
I realized I was in the mood for cereal.

19:22.866 --> 19:25.926
Not really the point.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.639
- Okay, I'm back. ( Chuckles )
- See you.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.575
Finally, we're all alone.

19:33.576 --> 19:35.270
Hello.

19:35.271 --> 19:38.151
Except for Charlie.

19:39.716 --> 19:42.918
- Hi, Charlie.
- How did he get in there?

19:42.919 --> 19:44.920
Charlie, Spencer's not
really in the computer.

19:44.921 --> 19:47.237
He's in Boston.

19:47.238 --> 19:50.592
- Can you see me?
- I sure can.

19:50.593 --> 19:54.313
I just can't see your sister.

19:58.401 --> 20:02.375
Yeah, just chilling
in my new room, dude.

20:02.376 --> 20:03.642
Yeah, I'm loving it.

20:03.643 --> 20:06.463
( Washer chugging )

20:06.576 --> 20:10.476
Um, I'm gonna need to call you back.

20:10.477 --> 20:14.317
No, the spin cycle just started.

20:15.651 --> 20:18.951
This might be a problem.

20:21.557 --> 20:23.757
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:23.758 --> 20:26.067
Just thought I'd pop over and tell you,

20:26.068 --> 20:28.898
- I saw your blog.
- Oh.

20:28.899 --> 20:34.779
And I especially enjoyed your
first post, "that darn Carlie".

20:36.528 --> 20:39.888
So important to proofread.

20:41.135 --> 20:44.363
Oh. Well uh, thank you.

20:44.364 --> 20:48.663
And next time you have any helpful
suggestions, don't come over.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.921
Yeah. Just feel free to put
it in my comments section.

20:51.922 --> 20:54.512
Oh, that's thoughtful.

20:54.513 --> 20:57.640
Mm-hmm. Well, I always enjoy
telling you where to put things.

20:57.641 --> 21:02.731
Mmm. Since I'm here now,
let me give you a few tips.

21:02.732 --> 21:06.160
I call them "Debbie
Dooley's dos and don'ts".

21:06.161 --> 21:09.101
Do use spell-check.

21:09.151 --> 21:12.631
Don't not use spell-check.

21:14.548 --> 21:19.748
Do know that my blog will always
be more popular than yours.

21:19.749 --> 21:22.929
Don't think it won't.

21:25.956 --> 21:27.876
Okay.

21:29.892 --> 21:31.860
That's great. That's great.

21:31.861 --> 21:34.940
Though, you know, I have some
helpful hints myself. Yeah.

21:34.941 --> 21:37.909
( Mockingly ) Do go back
to where you came from.

21:37.910 --> 21:41.090
Don't bother me again.

21:44.841 --> 21:47.909
So how's the long-distance
relationship going?

21:47.910 --> 21:51.487
Not good. You know, we both
have such different schedules,

21:51.488 --> 21:53.989
we barely had any time to talk.

21:53.990 --> 21:59.210
Told you you should've
locked him in the basement.

21:59.264 --> 22:03.792
I know it's only been three
days, but I miss him so much.

22:03.793 --> 22:05.760
I just wish I could see him.

22:05.761 --> 22:07.529
So why don't you?

22:07.530 --> 22:10.765
Fly all the way to Boston by myself?

22:10.766 --> 22:13.485
My mom and dad would
never let me do that.

22:13.486 --> 22:15.411
Unless they didn't know about it.

22:15.412 --> 22:18.740
You could just tell them that you're
spending the weekend at my house.

22:18.741 --> 22:21.177
- Ooh.
- Mm hmm.

22:21.178 --> 22:24.480
That's good. I like that.

22:24.481 --> 22:27.586
So this weekend, we'll be at...

22:27.587 --> 22:29.718
"Your house".

22:29.719 --> 22:33.379
<i>♪ Yeah, sleepover at Ivy's!</i>

22:33.856 --> 22:36.658
It's not really happening.

22:36.659 --> 22:40.499
Yeah, it's not really happening.

22:41.075 --> 22:45.635
( Whispers ) I'll
bring the popcorn balls.

22:49.359 --> 22:52.179
Oh, this is nice.

22:52.540 --> 22:55.277
( Garage door rattling )

22:55.278 --> 22:58.278
( Vehicle approaches )

22:59.682 --> 23:02.884
( Engine stops ) ( Door opens )

23:02.885 --> 23:05.687
- Hey, Gabe.
- You left the lights on, dad.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.523
They turn off by themselves.

23:07.524 --> 23:08.643
( Clicks )

23:08.644 --> 23:10.504
See?

23:11.099 --> 23:13.619
( Gabe sighs )

23:14.487 --> 23:17.466
( Alarm blaring ) Ah!

23:17.467 --> 23:19.327
Dad!

23:22.201 --> 23:27.541
( Shouting ) Yeah, been
having some trouble with that!

23:28.448 --> 23:32.169
- ( Alarm continues )
- Well, good night!

23:32.170 --> 23:34.750
( Door closes )

23:37.149 --> 23:41.656
Okay, mom. Well, I'm off
to Ivy's for the weekend.

23:41.657 --> 23:46.296
Whoa. That's a pretty big
suitcase you got there.

23:46.297 --> 23:49.864
Oh, Ivy and I are doing
makeovers. We're, uh... you...

23:49.865 --> 23:51.453
You know us girls.

23:51.454 --> 23:53.768
Oh, well, before you go,
come check out my blog.

23:53.769 --> 23:56.829
Oh, you have a blog.

23:56.872 --> 24:00.576
- "Half a dozen Duncans".
- Catchy, huh?

24:00.577 --> 24:02.578
"The adventures of Amy Duncan,

24:02.579 --> 24:06.418
a mama bird whose nest is
bursting with six crazy chickies".

24:06.419 --> 24:09.916
Mom, you only have five kids.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.557
I made one up.

24:12.655 --> 24:14.695
Skippy.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.240
- Skippy Duncan.
- Mmm.

24:17.241 --> 24:19.325
Skippy Marie Duncan.

24:19.326 --> 24:21.530
She's eight.

24:21.531 --> 24:23.832
You are an interesting woman, mom.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.768
Thank you. Thank you.

24:26.769 --> 24:31.100
And oh my goodness,
this Skippy is a handful.

24:31.101 --> 24:35.810
Last night because she was afraid of the
dark, she set off a bunch of fireworks.

24:35.811 --> 24:39.312
Boy, did that cause a ruckus. ( Laughs )

24:39.313 --> 24:42.613
A very interesting woman.

24:49.825 --> 24:53.060
What happened? Did mom and dad kick you
out because you did something horrible?

24:53.061 --> 24:55.701
Please say yes.

24:55.714 --> 24:59.350
Dude, I didn't do anything.
This is my new room.

24:59.351 --> 25:01.247
Gabe, you can't live on the porch.

25:01.248 --> 25:04.014
- Why not?
- Well, for one thing, there's no light.

25:04.015 --> 25:05.774
Porch light.

25:05.775 --> 25:07.476
There's no running water.

25:07.477 --> 25:09.034
Hose.

25:09.035 --> 25:10.409
What about a bathroom?

25:10.410 --> 25:13.110
Hello. ( Laughs )

25:13.411 --> 25:15.584
You've got it all figured out, huh?

25:15.585 --> 25:17.586
Been so busy with your new room

25:17.587 --> 25:21.036
you forgot to get in
trouble for your big brother.

25:21.037 --> 25:23.822
What are you so afraid
to tell mom and dad?

25:23.823 --> 25:25.661
Can't say. It's bad.

25:25.662 --> 25:31.190
Oh, come on, it can't be that
bad. Just tell me what it is.

25:31.191 --> 25:33.233
Okay, but you have to
promise not to tell anybody.

25:33.234 --> 25:34.703
I promise.

25:34.704 --> 25:36.237
( Sighs )

25:36.238 --> 25:39.298
All right. Here goes.

25:39.570 --> 25:41.610
I dropped out of college.

25:41.611 --> 25:43.196
What?!

25:43.197 --> 25:46.448
Oh man, mom and dad are gonna kill you!

25:46.449 --> 25:48.083
You just said it wasn't even that bad.

25:48.084 --> 25:50.819
I didn't know what it was!

25:50.820 --> 25:53.488
Wait. Why'd you quit college?

25:53.489 --> 25:56.228
Because it's just...
it's just not for me.

25:56.229 --> 25:58.244
And there's something else I wanna do.

25:58.245 --> 25:59.761
Well, you'd better do it quick,

25:59.762 --> 26:03.699
- because mom and dad are gonna kill you!
- You said that already!

26:03.700 --> 26:05.470
( Sighs )

26:05.471 --> 26:07.603
Well, when are you gonna tell 'em?

26:07.604 --> 26:08.737
I don't know.

26:08.738 --> 26:10.322
Soon, probably.

26:10.323 --> 26:13.742
There's a chance dad might
be in some hot water with mom.

26:13.743 --> 26:17.470
I'm gonna wait and
see how that plays out.

26:17.471 --> 26:18.833
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

26:18.834 --> 26:22.614
- Yeah, sure, go ahead.
- Cool.

26:25.347 --> 26:27.723
- Oh, hey, hon.
- Hey, sweetie.

26:27.724 --> 26:30.825
Look, babe, there's sandwich fixins
over there if you're interested.

26:30.826 --> 26:32.443
Oh!

26:32.444 --> 26:34.704
That sounds...

26:34.705 --> 26:36.565
Guh!

26:37.744 --> 26:40.406
"Guh"? What does that mean?

26:40.407 --> 26:42.507
Nothing.

26:54.817 --> 26:56.685
What are you doing?

26:56.686 --> 26:59.326
Just stretching.

26:59.822 --> 27:01.657
Before you eat?

27:01.658 --> 27:04.778
It's pretty important.

27:10.533 --> 27:12.634
So what's bringing you to Boston?

27:12.635 --> 27:14.521
Well, hopefully this plane.

27:14.522 --> 27:17.042
( Both laugh )

27:17.872 --> 27:21.264
No, actually, I'm gonna
go visit my boyfriend.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.196
We're in a long-distance relationship.

27:23.197 --> 27:25.872
Ah. Well, you're sitting
next to the right guy.

27:25.873 --> 27:30.102
I travel for a living
and I've got tons of tips.

27:30.103 --> 27:33.655
First off, don't travel for a living.

27:33.656 --> 27:35.876
( Laughs )

27:37.079 --> 27:41.245
Seriously now, you're always gonna
have to have one of these things handy.

27:41.246 --> 27:43.180
Well, it looks very comfortable.

27:43.181 --> 27:45.960
Ah! ( Bag rustles )

27:45.961 --> 27:48.419
I always carry a spare.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.045
Thanks. ( Chuckles )

27:50.046 --> 27:51.734
Hungry?

27:51.735 --> 27:54.710
Uh, I guess. What do you got?

27:54.711 --> 27:57.231
Waldorf salad.

27:57.847 --> 27:59.948
Well, if that's all you got.

27:59.949 --> 28:02.710
Fresh ground pepper?

28:02.711 --> 28:05.771
Don't mind if I do.

28:07.724 --> 28:09.691
By the way, I'm Herb Pickier.

28:09.692 --> 28:12.777
Oh, Teddy Duncan. Nice to meet you.

28:12.778 --> 28:18.678
Tell me, Teddy, do you have any
need for high-pressure gas flanges?

28:18.977 --> 28:21.570
Um, not at the moment.

28:21.571 --> 28:25.345
Oh. Well, take my card, anyway.

28:25.346 --> 28:27.986
You never know.

28:28.611 --> 28:32.631
I pretty much know, but thank you.

28:33.516 --> 28:35.717
So how long you gonna be in Boston?

28:35.718 --> 28:38.399
Oh, just for the weekend. I'm
gonna surprise my boyfriend.

28:38.400 --> 28:43.215
- Oh.
- I can't wait to see the look on his face.

28:43.216 --> 28:45.334
I'm going to Denver to
surprise my girlfriend.

28:45.335 --> 28:49.835
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

28:50.374 --> 28:53.554
( Violin music playing )

28:56.611 --> 28:58.107
( Knocks on door )

28:58.108 --> 28:59.780
It's open.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.941
Surprise!

29:02.155 --> 29:04.079
Oh wow.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.109
This is crazy.

29:06.110 --> 29:07.723
But I don't know who you are.

29:07.724 --> 29:10.441
Ahem, um, is Spencer here?

29:10.442 --> 29:13.477
He's in Denver. He went
to surprise his girlfriend.

29:13.478 --> 29:17.497
I'm his girlfriend. I
came here to surprise him.

29:17.498 --> 29:20.824
Well, that was exciting for a second.

29:20.825 --> 29:22.985
( Sighs )

29:24.867 --> 29:27.687
( Cellphone rings )

29:28.100 --> 29:31.611
Teddy. You're never
gonna guess where I am.

29:31.612 --> 29:35.566
- Denver?
- Huh. I thought that would be harder.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.402
Yeah, well, guess where I am.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.159
Boston!

29:40.160 --> 29:44.742
- What?
- Well, I guess we both had the same idea.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.903
Surprise!

29:47.099 --> 29:50.581
Oh gosh, this is terrible. We're
not gonna be able to see each other.

29:50.582 --> 29:53.305
Yes, we are. Okay, you stay right there.

29:53.306 --> 29:54.852
I'll just take the first flight back.

29:54.853 --> 29:56.787
Well, I mean I'm already
at your front door.

29:56.788 --> 29:59.523
- I might as well say hi to your parents.
- ( Doorbell rings )

29:59.524 --> 30:01.325
Don't. No no, what are you doing?

30:01.326 --> 30:02.767
They don't know that I'm out here.

30:02.768 --> 30:05.017
- Well, I just rang the bell.
- Just... move!

30:05.018 --> 30:07.358
( Stammers )

30:13.538 --> 30:18.338
Son, that is what we
call "ding-dong ditch".

30:24.858 --> 30:28.452
Hey, Charlie, wanna play a game?

30:28.453 --> 30:30.247
Okay, so I'm thinking of a number,

30:30.248 --> 30:34.034
and if you guess it, you get to
have Toby move into your room.

30:34.035 --> 30:36.255
Nice try.

30:40.445 --> 30:43.734
Hey P.J., you wanna play a game?

30:43.735 --> 30:46.386
Still trying to find a bedroom, huh?

30:46.387 --> 30:48.776
Yeah, and I've tried everywhere...

30:48.777 --> 30:51.542
The living room, the
basement, the front porch.

30:51.543 --> 30:54.791
I assume you've ruled
out the attic. Ugh!

30:54.792 --> 30:58.452
- The what?
- The attic. Ugh!

30:59.960 --> 31:01.485
We have an attic?

31:01.486 --> 31:03.896
Yeah. It's upstairs.

31:03.897 --> 31:06.390
Yeah yeah, that'd be the place for it.

31:06.391 --> 31:08.757
Wait. Why didn't I know we had an attic?

31:08.758 --> 31:11.456
You didn't know we had
a tree house either.

31:11.457 --> 31:14.937
You gotta start looking up.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.403
Huh.

31:20.508 --> 31:22.728
See? Ugh!

31:24.342 --> 31:26.508
It's not "ugh!" It's...

31:26.509 --> 31:28.489
"Hey!"

31:34.932 --> 31:35.957
( Sighs )

31:35.958 --> 31:38.393
- Teddy!
- Herb. Hi.

31:38.394 --> 31:40.413
Hey, how was your day in Boston?

31:40.414 --> 31:42.419
( Sighs ) Not so good.

31:42.420 --> 31:44.700
Pillow me.

31:45.630 --> 31:48.017
Thanks. So...

31:48.018 --> 31:52.594
My boyfriend decided to surprise
me and flew out to Denver.

31:52.595 --> 31:56.515
Oh, the old double surprise gone bad.

31:56.516 --> 32:00.130
I could sing a few bars of that one.

32:00.131 --> 32:02.436
But you're not going to, right?

32:02.437 --> 32:08.146
No no, they frown upon that
during the safety announcement.

32:08.147 --> 32:09.743
It's just that by the time I get back,

32:09.744 --> 32:12.269
Spencer I will barely
have any time together.

32:12.270 --> 32:14.576
All long-distance
relationships are brutal.

32:14.577 --> 32:16.760
You try to make 'em work.

32:16.761 --> 32:20.371
You email, you text, you video chat...

32:20.372 --> 32:24.515
Then one night you decide you'd rather
watch a "Battlestar Galactica" Marathon

32:24.516 --> 32:28.416
and suddenly you're the bad guy.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.709
I'm pretty sure that won't happen to me.

32:32.710 --> 32:37.750
Stay away from the first
season. It's addictive.

32:38.071 --> 32:40.013
Good to know.

32:40.014 --> 32:42.872
All I'm trying to say
is there's no substitute

32:42.873 --> 32:45.402
for being in the same place together,

32:45.403 --> 32:51.103
and anyone who thinks otherwise
is just kidding themselves.

32:51.409 --> 32:53.444
Oh, except for you and your boyfriend.

32:53.445 --> 32:56.480
You kids'll be fine.

32:56.481 --> 32:58.449
( P.A. chimes )

32:58.450 --> 33:00.911
This is the Captain speaking.
Just wanna let you know

33:00.912 --> 33:03.276
that there's some weather
over the Ohio valley,

33:03.277 --> 33:05.170
so we're gonna be a
little delayed tonight...

33:05.171 --> 33:08.094
Three, four hours tops.

33:08.095 --> 33:10.760
Wha... well, here's a thought:

33:10.761 --> 33:14.124
( Emphatically ) Fly around Ohio.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.144
( Sighs )

33:15.145 --> 33:18.788
Well, looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.189
Mini quiche?

33:27.089 --> 33:30.389
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, P.J.

33:30.616 --> 33:33.716
P.J.'s voice: Okay, she's
sitting right there. Just...

33:33.717 --> 33:36.615
Get it over with and tell her
you dropped out of college.

33:36.616 --> 33:38.866
If you hold it in one
more second, you'll go...

33:38.867 --> 33:41.179
Ooh, grapes!

33:41.180 --> 33:43.162
When did we get those?

33:43.163 --> 33:46.866
Mom must've gone to the store.

33:46.867 --> 33:50.467
But she doesn't always wash them.

33:50.468 --> 33:54.428
Did I just eat an unwashed grape?

33:55.473 --> 33:58.168
What am I doing in the kitchen?

33:58.169 --> 34:00.449
Oh, right.

34:03.352 --> 34:05.212
Mom?

34:05.386 --> 34:09.219
- There's something I gotta tell ya.
- ( Phone rings )

34:09.219 --> 34:10.460
( Beeps )

34:10.462 --> 34:12.442
Hello.

34:12.887 --> 34:14.291
Yeah, hold on.

34:14.292 --> 34:17.614
Uh, somebody from "Good Morning,
Denver" wants to talk to you.

34:17.616 --> 34:21.134
"Good Morning, Denver"? The TV show?

34:21.135 --> 34:23.054
Yeah.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.694
I think I have a minute.

34:29.291 --> 34:30.916
Hello.

34:30.917 --> 34:31.989
( Clears throat )

34:31.991 --> 34:34.451
This is she.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.168
Uh-huh.

34:37.168 --> 34:39.268
Uh-huh.

34:39.384 --> 34:42.831
I... I think I could arrange something.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.650
Oh, very good.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.831
Yes, thank you for calling.

34:47.833 --> 34:49.993
( Beeps )

34:50.589 --> 34:53.529
( Screams, whooping )

34:58.268 --> 35:01.028
What's going on?

35:01.306 --> 35:02.289
( Inhales deeply )

35:02.290 --> 35:04.441
I'm gonna be on TV!

35:04.442 --> 35:06.109
Wow, that's great, mom.

35:06.110 --> 35:10.247
They loved my mommy blog and they
want me to do a segment on the show!

35:10.248 --> 35:12.566
And if it all goes well, be a regular.

35:12.567 --> 35:15.845
- They said that?
- No, but they will!

35:15.846 --> 35:18.666
After I'm on TV.

35:29.417 --> 35:32.770
Well, I think that's all the ant traps.

35:32.771 --> 35:36.047
Okay. Well, by now the
ants have done their job

35:36.048 --> 35:39.325
- and the termites are gone.
- Sure hope so.

35:39.326 --> 35:42.993
Come on, 2,000 ants
against two termites?

35:42.994 --> 35:46.229
I think I likes me my odds.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.050
- ( Cracks )
- Oh!

35:51.068 --> 35:53.921
Oh no, I... it's termites!

35:53.922 --> 35:55.541
Dozens of 'em!

35:55.542 --> 35:57.666
How did they multiply so fast?

35:57.667 --> 35:59.678
Well, they are in the Duncan house.

35:59.679 --> 36:03.759
Kind of a "when in Rome" situation?

36:04.635 --> 36:07.237
Ah. We're gonna have to tent the house.

36:07.238 --> 36:09.239
What am I gonna tell Amy?

36:09.240 --> 36:10.838
You could tell her the truth.

36:10.839 --> 36:12.759
Or...

36:13.444 --> 36:16.164
- A vacation?
- Yes.

36:16.165 --> 36:20.787
Honey, you work so hard, you do so
much around here you deserve a vacation.

36:20.788 --> 36:23.420
Well, okay. That sounds
great. When were you thinking?

36:23.421 --> 36:27.324
8:00 A.M. Tuesday to 8:00 A.M. Thursday.

36:27.325 --> 36:28.903
48 hours of fun!

36:28.904 --> 36:32.562
Just you, me, the kids
and the perishables.

36:32.563 --> 36:34.464
Bob, Bob, I can't do that.

36:34.465 --> 36:36.876
I'm gonna be on TV
Tuesday morning, remember?

36:36.877 --> 36:38.875
Oh, right. Um...

36:38.876 --> 36:41.442
Okay, no problem. We'll
leave right after you're done.

36:41.443 --> 36:43.287
Okay, sounds great.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.584
Hey, why are we taking the perishables?

36:46.585 --> 36:48.502
Because...

36:48.503 --> 36:49.994
We...

36:49.995 --> 36:52.035
Coming!

36:56.520 --> 36:59.280
( Doorbell rings )

37:01.725 --> 37:04.768
- Finally.
- Oh there's my girl.

37:04.769 --> 37:07.126
Hey, what time did
you get in last night?

37:07.127 --> 37:10.607
4:00 A.M. I am so sorry.

37:11.336 --> 37:15.625
The plane got delayed, quiches went
cold, Herb only brought one side salad...

37:15.626 --> 37:18.026
It was a complete disaster.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.141
Herb?

37:19.142 --> 37:22.346
Yeah, you'll probably meet
him on the flight back.

37:22.347 --> 37:25.243
But the important thing
is that we're together now.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.190
Well, for an hour.

37:27.191 --> 37:28.142
What?

37:28.143 --> 37:30.531
Yeah, I have to catch a
plane. I've got class tomorrow.

37:30.532 --> 37:34.844
Well, great. So I have to wait
until spring break to see you again?

37:34.845 --> 37:36.778
Oh. Gosh.

37:36.779 --> 37:40.041
My parents are coming to
Boston for spring break.

37:40.042 --> 37:43.333
So we have one hour
together in five months?

37:43.334 --> 37:46.547
Well, we can find a couple of
weekends to visit each other.

37:46.548 --> 37:48.543
No, Spence, I can't.

37:48.544 --> 37:52.652
My parents don't even know that I took
this trip, I can't lie to them again.

37:52.653 --> 37:55.918
Well, what are we gonna do?

37:55.919 --> 37:59.991
I don't know. I didn't know
it was gonna be this hard.

37:59.992 --> 38:02.752
Yeah, me neither.

38:03.388 --> 38:05.422
I just can't spend all
my time missing you.

38:05.423 --> 38:09.083
I'm gonna drive myself crazy.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.840
Yeah, I feel the same way.

38:15.983 --> 38:18.623
What do we do?

38:18.870 --> 38:23.240
Well, I mean, there's
nothing we can do, except...

38:23.241 --> 38:27.261
I don't wanna say it. ( Sniffles )

38:27.761 --> 38:31.841
Yeah, I don't wanna say it either.

38:37.046 --> 38:39.446
I love you.

38:42.951 --> 38:45.951
Oh, I love you too.

38:49.300 --> 38:52.469
I'm gonna miss you so much.

38:52.470 --> 38:55.170
Why you so sad?

38:56.872 --> 38:59.092
Oh, um...

39:00.076 --> 39:04.205
Well because we're saying
goodbye, Charlie, and...

39:04.206 --> 39:07.384
It's a very hard thing to do.

39:07.385 --> 39:10.205
Then say, "hello".

39:11.289 --> 39:13.209
Yeah.

39:14.258 --> 39:17.678
Yeah, maybe that's easier.

39:21.797 --> 39:24.257
Hello, Teddy.

39:24.335 --> 39:26.915
Hello, Spencer.

39:32.822 --> 39:33.820
Ah!

39:33.821 --> 39:36.313
Home sweet home.

39:36.314 --> 39:38.525
( Footsteps )

39:38.526 --> 39:42.543
Oh! ( Sighs ) Gabriel
Duncan, what is going on?

39:42.544 --> 39:44.254
This is my new room.

39:44.255 --> 39:46.562
I didn't think you knew about the attic.

39:46.563 --> 39:49.021
Well, the word gets around.

39:49.022 --> 39:51.661
It took 13 years, but it got around.

39:51.662 --> 39:52.612
( Sighs )

39:52.613 --> 39:55.975
Honey, you cannot turn the
attic into your bedroom.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.022
( Gasps )

39:58.023 --> 40:01.623
You can't, but maybe I can.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.404
What?

40:03.405 --> 40:06.744
Well, I've been looking for something
to talk about on TV tomorrow,

40:06.745 --> 40:08.485
and this is perfect!

40:08.486 --> 40:12.056
My house was too small,
but I had a brainstorm.

40:12.057 --> 40:15.117
You had a brainstorm?

40:15.286 --> 40:18.243
Well, it sure wasn't Skippy.

40:18.244 --> 40:21.244
( Laughs ) No no no.

40:29.781 --> 40:32.950
( P.J., high-pitched )
Hi, Teddy, remember me?

40:32.951 --> 40:34.864
Not now, P.J.

40:34.865 --> 40:37.407
Oh, I don't know any P.J.

40:37.408 --> 40:40.000
I'm Socky the sock puppet.

40:40.001 --> 40:41.779
Yeah, I remember.

40:41.780 --> 40:45.798
When you were little and feeling
sad, I used to cheer you up.

40:45.799 --> 40:47.933
And that's what I'm here to do now.

40:47.934 --> 40:51.954
Let's turn that frown upside down!

40:52.773 --> 40:55.893
I don't think I can.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.733
Better let me handle this, Socky.

40:59.734 --> 41:02.794
( High-pitched ) Okay.

41:03.413 --> 41:08.129
( Normal voice ) I know it hurts, but
trust me, this is the hardest part.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.309
( Crying ) I just miss him so much.

41:10.310 --> 41:13.099
It's gonna get better.
It's gonna get better.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.411
I know because I've been through this.

41:15.412 --> 41:19.035
Remember when Skyler moved away?
I thought my world was over but,

41:19.036 --> 41:21.722
somehow I managed to move on.

41:21.723 --> 41:23.664
You will too.

41:23.665 --> 41:25.673
Well, I just...

41:25.674 --> 41:29.117
I don't want it to be over.

41:29.118 --> 41:31.818
Maybe it isn't.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.579
What do you mean?

41:33.580 --> 41:37.796
Maybe someday, when
the timing's right...

41:37.797 --> 41:42.057
You and Spence will be together again.

41:47.452 --> 41:49.729
( High-pitched )
Uh-oh, lint ball.

41:49.730 --> 41:51.401
( Coughs )

41:51.402 --> 41:53.622
( Laughs )

41:54.036 --> 41:55.453
Hey, there it is.

41:55.454 --> 41:57.458
There's that smile.

41:57.459 --> 41:59.249
Oh, Socky.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.874
When did my big brother
get to be so wise?

42:01.875 --> 42:04.811
- When he dropped out of college.
- You did what?!

42:04.812 --> 42:10.332
( Normal voice ) I don't
know what he's talking about.

42:12.561 --> 42:14.619
How you feeling, sweetie?

42:14.620 --> 42:16.071
You doing okay?

42:16.072 --> 42:18.170
I'm good, mommy.

42:18.171 --> 42:20.087
Oh, honey, I was talking to Teddy.

42:20.088 --> 42:21.761
No, I'm okay, mom.

42:21.762 --> 42:23.796
But don't worry about me.

42:23.797 --> 42:25.665
Today is your big day.

42:25.666 --> 42:28.195
Hey, mommy's gonna be on TV.

42:28.196 --> 42:30.476
Yeah yeah.

42:31.839 --> 42:34.502
Teddy, look, if you ever need to talk.

42:34.503 --> 42:37.083
- You know I'm here for you.
- Thanks.

42:37.084 --> 42:39.112
Teddy's voice: Go ahead, tell her.

42:39.113 --> 42:42.014
Tell her you lied about the
sleepover and went to Boston.

42:42.015 --> 42:44.184
Now's the perfect time.

42:44.185 --> 42:45.651
She's in a good mood and...

42:45.652 --> 42:48.052
Ooh! Grapes.

42:50.724 --> 42:53.184
( Amy gasps )

42:54.991 --> 42:57.454
Yes yes, much better.

42:57.455 --> 42:59.836
Much better. Been wanting to
get rid of that door for years.

42:59.837 --> 43:01.734
It really opens the space up.

43:01.735 --> 43:05.347
Bob, what is going on? Why
do things keep breaking?

43:05.348 --> 43:08.288
Honey, things break.

43:08.408 --> 43:11.191
Happens all the time.
The real question...

43:11.192 --> 43:14.444
Is "why weren't things breaking before?"

43:14.445 --> 43:16.665
( Mouths )

43:20.013 --> 43:24.208
Thanks, Phil. And now let's say
hello to mommy blogger Amy Duncan.

43:24.209 --> 43:27.036
Good morning, Amy. Good morning, Jan.

43:27.037 --> 43:29.954
And Good Morning, Denver.

43:29.955 --> 43:32.832
So what are you going to
talk to us about today, Amy?

43:32.833 --> 43:34.567
Problem-solving, Jan.

43:34.568 --> 43:37.537
When your nest is as
full as this mama bird's,

43:37.538 --> 43:40.435
you're always finding
ways to make more room.

43:40.436 --> 43:43.929
All of my loyal readers know
that my youngest daughter Charlie,

43:43.930 --> 43:46.445
shares a room with her sister Skippy.

43:46.446 --> 43:48.966
- Who?
- Shh!

43:51.539 --> 43:55.227
And that Skippy is quite
a handful, isn't she?

43:55.228 --> 43:59.008
Oh, don't get me started, Jan.

44:00.402 --> 44:02.562
Anyway...

44:03.630 --> 44:05.981
Now that baby Toby needs his own room,

44:05.982 --> 44:09.480
I have to find someplace
to put my teenage boy, Gabe.

44:09.481 --> 44:12.504
And believe me, we tried everywhere...

44:12.505 --> 44:17.785
The living room, the
basement, even the front porch.

44:18.915 --> 44:20.479
And then it hit me...

44:20.480 --> 44:25.651
Why not clear out the attic and convert
it into a really cool loft space?

44:25.652 --> 44:28.597
Well, that's exactly what I did.

44:28.598 --> 44:31.982
It was a lot of hard
work, but as I always say,

44:31.983 --> 44:35.628
a mama bird's job is to
build the perfect nest.

44:35.629 --> 44:38.989
Could you hold this, Jan?

44:46.473 --> 44:49.173
( Wood cracking )

44:50.106 --> 44:52.386
( Crashes )

44:54.628 --> 44:56.788
( Gasps )

44:58.451 --> 45:01.737
Let's kick it back to the studio, Jan.

45:01.738 --> 45:04.724
No no no, I think we'll
keep it right here.

45:04.725 --> 45:06.558
What just happened, Amy?

45:06.559 --> 45:09.082
Good question. Bob?

45:09.083 --> 45:11.082
Um, okay.

45:11.083 --> 45:14.500
Uh, you know those termites
I brought home the other day?

45:14.501 --> 45:16.636
They kinda got out.

45:16.637 --> 45:18.902
You let termites eat our house?

45:18.903 --> 45:20.998
- I dropped out of college.
- What?!

45:20.999 --> 45:23.049
And I went to Boston
without your permission.

45:23.050 --> 45:25.678
- What?!
- Wow!

45:25.679 --> 45:29.025
Mama bird, it looks like
your nest is falling apart...

45:29.026 --> 45:32.829
In more ways than one.
What do you have to say?

45:32.830 --> 45:34.980
Amy's voice: This whole
thing is a disaster.

45:34.981 --> 45:37.810
Might as well tell her
that Skippy's a lie too.

45:37.811 --> 45:41.072
Just go ahead. Just do it.

45:41.073 --> 45:42.885
And now for the weather.

45:42.886 --> 45:45.123
The skies are...

45:45.124 --> 45:47.824
Sunny and clear.

45:49.430 --> 45:52.310
Back to you, Phil.

45:56.743 --> 45:58.510
Okay, you guys, come on.

45:58.511 --> 46:00.935
Come on, let's go. Shake a leg.

46:00.936 --> 46:03.203
I finally get my own room
and now we have to move out.

46:03.204 --> 46:04.711
It's just for a couple of nights.

46:04.712 --> 46:07.553
We're gonna get the house checked
out, make sure everything's safe...

46:07.554 --> 46:09.388
Take care of the termite problem.

46:09.389 --> 46:11.490
I thought that was implied.

46:11.491 --> 46:14.626
And then we are gonna move back in and
everything's gonna be back to normal.

46:14.627 --> 46:16.461
What do you mean, "normal"?

46:16.462 --> 46:19.289
- P.J. dropped out of college.
- Teddy went to Boston.

46:19.290 --> 46:22.702
- Dad brought termites in the house.
- Well, Gabe...

46:22.703 --> 46:24.837
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

46:24.838 --> 46:28.438
As usual, I'm the good one.

46:28.441 --> 46:30.843
Bob, this family is
completely falling apart.

46:30.844 --> 46:32.544
No, it isn't.

46:32.545 --> 46:34.646
Look, guys, I dropped out
of college for a reason.

46:34.647 --> 46:36.959
I want to go to culinary school.

46:36.960 --> 46:42.860
I'm good at cooking, I'm passionate
about it and I look good in the hat.

46:44.114 --> 46:47.392
Okay, well, I feel better
now that you have a plan.

46:47.393 --> 46:50.362
Yeah, well, as for you,
young lady, you are grounded.

46:50.363 --> 46:53.532
You're gonna be spending
a lotta time in your room.

46:53.533 --> 46:56.653
I don't have a room.

46:57.269 --> 47:02.180
Well, we're gonna find you a
room and I'm gonna put you in it.

47:02.181 --> 47:03.876
All right. Come on, guys, let's go.

47:03.877 --> 47:05.293
- Can you...
- Yeah.

47:05.294 --> 47:08.234
Thank you. ( Sighs )

47:09.172 --> 47:13.589
Okay, house, see you
in a couple of days.

47:13.590 --> 47:16.170
( Wood creaks )

47:26.841 --> 47:29.121
Or longer.

47:40.696 --> 47:44.945
Hi, Charlie, I'm back. Um, where was I?

47:44.946 --> 47:48.097
Oh, right... worst day ever.

47:48.098 --> 47:53.068
So the whole house was eaten by termites
and we don't have a place to live.

47:53.069 --> 47:55.576
Ugh. Yeah, it's a disaster.

47:55.577 --> 47:58.436
Well, not for you. You
have your own apartment.

47:58.437 --> 48:01.076
Oh yeah. That makes me feel better.

48:01.077 --> 48:02.878
See ya.

48:02.879 --> 48:04.661
- ( Door opens, closes )
- ( Scoffs )

48:04.662 --> 48:06.576
Well, the rest of us have no idea

48:06.577 --> 48:09.050
where we'll end up, but
I'm sure we'll be fine.

48:09.051 --> 48:13.911
But just in case, wish
us good luck, Charlie.

48:16.997 --> 48:19.513
- He was visiting BIPA.
- Whapa?

48:19.514 --> 48:21.496
BIPA, the bostotin...

48:21.497 --> 48:22.799
Bostotin... sorry.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.979
Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

48:24.980 --> 48:28.472
- Whapa?
- BIPA, the bostonin...

48:28.473 --> 48:31.672
BIPA, the Boston instit... ( Laughs )

48:31.673 --> 48:34.793
- Whapa?
- ( Coughing )

48:36.614 --> 48:39.148
It's all going so well.

48:39.149 --> 48:40.530
Hey, sweetie.

48:40.531 --> 48:42.256
Oh, there's some sandwich fictions if...

48:42.257 --> 48:44.157
- I can't say that word.
- Man: Go back to one.

48:44.158 --> 48:47.387
I'm from the South. I should
be able to say "fixins".

48:47.388 --> 48:49.737
Well, for one thing, there's no light.

48:49.738 --> 48:52.138
Porch light.

48:52.393 --> 48:53.151
No.

48:53.152 --> 48:55.024
- Porch light's right here.
- It's right there.

48:55.025 --> 48:57.308
Ivy: So how's the long-distance
relationship going?

48:57.309 --> 48:59.144
- Not go...
- ( Motorcycles passing )

48:59.145 --> 49:05.045
There's, like, a motorcycle
gang going by the set right now.

49:05.352 --> 49:08.585
I don't know I'm just kinda in shock.

49:08.586 --> 49:11.106
Yeah, me too.

49:11.321 --> 49:17.221
Who's ready for some delicious
New England chicken noodle chowder?

49:19.976 --> 49:22.556
Shoulder bread?
