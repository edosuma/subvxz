WEBVTT

01:27.163 --> 01:29.028
All right, now.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.294
I'm just heading to the fields, Duke.
I'll be back.

02:00.596 --> 02:01.893
Clear!

02:05.167 --> 02:06.464
Hey, Jerry, how's your mama?

02:09.972 --> 02:14.102
Oh, yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Well, time to go to work.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.948
Morning, Ben.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.787
Thanks, Miles.

02:26.388 --> 02:28.049
Let me know if you see Otis.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.250
I'm staying out of that one.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.626
- Okay, meeting's in five minutes.
- Okay, boss.

02:33.729 --> 02:35.924
And I want everyone present.

02:36.832 --> 02:38.390
Duke, have you seen Otis?

02:38.501 --> 02:40.196
Nope, I haven't seen him.

02:40.436 --> 02:43.030
Now where was I? Oh, oh, yeah.

02:46.942 --> 02:48.807
The Jersey cows.

02:51.013 --> 02:53.481
- Hey, Benny boy.
- Hi.

02:54.984 --> 02:56.611
Hey, you seen Otis around?

02:56.719 --> 02:59.210
Yes, I know exactly where Otis is.

02:59.355 --> 03:02.449
You boys just steer clear
of Otis, all right?

03:03.058 --> 03:04.719
Anything you say there, Ben.

03:04.827 --> 03:06.192
We'll take a rain check
on the meeting, though.

03:06.295 --> 03:09.230
- Yeah, rain check.
- Yeah, that. Check.

03:09.331 --> 03:10.298
Hey.

03:12.501 --> 03:15.868
Hey, I stepped in something.
What's on my hoof?

03:17.039 --> 03:18.097
Etta?

03:19.375 --> 03:22.310
- Otis?
- Oh, Ben, don't worry.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.039
I'm sure he's heading
for the meeting right now.

03:28.517 --> 03:30.246
Okay, let go. Let go. I got it.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.944
- He said, "Let go."
- All right. He's okay.

03:32.054 --> 03:34.852
All right, boys, here's the dealio.

03:34.957 --> 03:39.121
It's a little creation of mine
I like to call "hill surfing."

03:39.261 --> 03:41.559
- Watch your hoof.
- I'll spot you. I'll spot you.

03:41.664 --> 03:43.996
Are you sure this is safe, Otis?

03:44.366 --> 03:46.095
Peck! Come on, safe?

03:46.335 --> 03:49.270
It's completely safe!
Since when isn't surfing safe?

03:49.371 --> 03:50.599
He's got a point.

03:50.706 --> 03:53.470
Okay, salt lick.

03:55.878 --> 03:58.745
- It's go time!
- I'll try it. I'm down.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.314
- Shotgun!
- Piggyback!

04:00.416 --> 04:02.714
Never! You are all gonna die.

04:05.154 --> 04:06.644
- Freddy?
- Nothing.

04:06.755 --> 04:08.586
Wait a second. Photo op.

04:08.691 --> 04:10.056
Okay, get together!

04:15.197 --> 04:16.687
- Hey, Pig?
- What?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.959
- Where'd you get that apple?
- This apple?

04:19.067 --> 04:22.435
Oh, well,
it originally was attached to this.

04:26.342 --> 04:27.536
Otis?

04:27.643 --> 04:30.305
What? What? What happened?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.604
You know, it's times like this
when I really like to say...

04:35.017 --> 04:36.143
Oh, caca!

04:36.252 --> 04:38.812
You didn't do that!

04:59.241 --> 05:01.766
Okay, okay! Look, this is bad enough!

05:01.877 --> 05:04.437
Please, no one scream, "Tree!"

05:04.847 --> 05:07.247
Tree!

05:15.057 --> 05:16.422
Let's surf!

05:26.201 --> 05:29.227
Hang on now, boys! Yeah! Hang hoof!

05:29.338 --> 05:32.239
Otis? Are we supposed to
not yell, "Rock"?

05:54.496 --> 05:56.555
We got a gusher!

06:08.210 --> 06:10.337
Chicken farm!

06:10.446 --> 06:12.038
Oh, I get it.
We can't yell "Tree" or "Rock",

06:12.147 --> 06:13.774
but you get to yell, "Chicken farm."

06:27.329 --> 06:28.956
Morning, everyone.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.658
Okay, before we get started,
we have a birthday.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.101
Everett the dog turned 13 today.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.470
Boy, those dog years are rough, huh?

06:42.144 --> 06:43.702
Also, remember it's...

06:51.253 --> 06:52.447
Whassup?

06:53.655 --> 06:57.614
Hey, Pop. Look, I know you're probably
looking for an explanation regarding

06:57.726 --> 07:01.787
the exploded chicken on me,
and the sticky black... The oil stuff.

07:05.534 --> 07:08.731
You are gonna love this! I'll tell you...
You the most, because

07:08.837 --> 07:10.998
you, my friend, are a laugher.
And every...

07:11.106 --> 07:13.506
- Didn't we all know that? Right?
- Just take a seat.

07:13.609 --> 07:15.907
I'll... I'll take a seat.

07:19.848 --> 07:20.906
Cool.

07:22.885 --> 07:24.978
Oh, sorry about that.

07:26.889 --> 07:28.550
Little tight.

07:30.893 --> 07:32.360
As I was saying,

07:32.461 --> 07:34.952
remember tonight at the hoedown,
it's free cider night.

07:35.063 --> 07:38.726
Hey. Hey, Pig,
I think there's a dead bee in your nostril.

07:40.536 --> 07:41.560
That's not dead.

07:41.670 --> 07:45.731
Okay, the first matter at hand:
gray market goods.

07:45.974 --> 07:48.340
As if I needed to say it again.

07:48.677 --> 07:52.408
The purchase of human articles
from the gopher underground

07:52.614 --> 07:54.548
is strictly prohibited.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.840
<i>Hello, Moto!</i>

08:03.392 --> 08:06.122
Hey, Otis.
Yeah, listen, I think your Nikes are...

08:06.228 --> 08:09.131
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

08:09.166 --> 08:09.187
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

08:09.298 --> 08:11.766
Hang on a second. Frankie, come here.
Frankie, come here.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.062
No, I'm not... Come here. I'm not
gonna hurt you. Frankie, come here.

08:14.169 --> 08:17.263
<i>I told you never to do that again,</i>
<i>as long as I live!</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:19.567
<i>Now, put it over there! Now!</i>

08:20.976 --> 08:22.375
Sorry about that. Frankie's out of hand.

08:22.478 --> 08:23.672
Oh, the Nikes. What's the make again?

08:23.779 --> 08:28.648
Yeah. Yeah, I really should go,
Mr. Jordan Air.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.183
Wrong number.

08:30.819 --> 08:32.116
Thank you.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.288
Second item.

08:36.692 --> 08:40.253
Lest I remind you, this is coyote season.

08:40.361 --> 08:41.385
That's right.

08:41.496 --> 08:44.295
These are ruthless
and desperate creatures.

08:44.867 --> 08:47.165
Rule number one: stay in groups.

08:47.936 --> 08:52.464
Rule number two: stay inside
the perimeter of the fence at all times.

08:53.141 --> 08:56.076
And number three: be careful out there.

08:56.678 --> 08:58.236
Okay, let's hit it.

09:03.785 --> 09:06.845
And leaving quickly. Walking out.
Walking out. Step, step, step wider...

09:06.955 --> 09:10.015
Otis, why don't you stick around
for a minute?

09:10.125 --> 09:11.683
He's scary. Bye.

09:12.127 --> 09:14.391
Okay, Miles. What do you think?

09:14.663 --> 09:16.324
I think you're lucky.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.490
Most cows only have four hooves,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.068
but you're gonna have an extra one
right up your...

09:21.169 --> 09:23.262
Okay, that's nice. Dad!

09:26.108 --> 09:27.939
- Sit.
- And I'm sitting.

09:28.911 --> 09:30.742
Okay. First off,

09:30.846 --> 09:34.009
I don't even want to know
who was on the other end of that phone.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.016
- It was the gophers, wasn't it?
- Well, I...

09:36.118 --> 09:39.144
No, I don't want to know.
Was it the gophers?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.249
- Here's...
- No, don't. I don't want to know.

09:42.824 --> 09:46.089
Why do you do this to me?
How do you think that makes me look?

09:46.194 --> 09:47.957
So this... This is about you?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.359
Where were you this morning, Otis?

09:50.465 --> 09:52.865
I was having a little fun.
I mean, you should try it.

09:52.968 --> 09:56.233
It starts with a smile,
then slowly builds and...

09:56.338 --> 09:59.034
You promised to help me
with the brush around the fence.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.041
You know it's coyote season.

10:01.143 --> 10:05.978
Geez, coyotes. I don't get it.
What's the big deal? They're coyotes.

10:06.081 --> 10:10.381
Them tiny, us big!
What are they gonna do?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.043
You have a lot to learn.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.213
And you know what,
I don't get the fence thing.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.018
Really, it can't keep them out.

10:16.124 --> 10:19.252
That fence defines our space.

10:19.361 --> 10:21.488
And as long as I'm still kicking,

10:21.597 --> 10:25.829
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

10:25.934 --> 10:28.129
Okay, that's what you do. You.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.796
Okay, if you're trying to groom me
to be the big leader,

10:30.906 --> 10:33.067
just give it up. It's not me, Pop.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.143
I mean, if I were in charge,
things would be different.

10:35.243 --> 10:38.406
Every animal for himself.
That's the way it should be.

10:38.780 --> 10:39.838
Otis.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.317
A strong man stands up for himself.

10:44.286 --> 10:47.050
A stronger man stands up for others.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.284
Oh, shoot. You know, I forgot my pen.

10:49.391 --> 10:52.019
- And your shift tonight?
- I'll be there.

10:52.127 --> 10:54.618
Otis, you're gonna have to
grow up one day.

10:54.730 --> 10:58.291
You'll never be happy
if you spend all your time goofing off.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.732
No? Just watch me.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.168
Manabunga!

11:15.183 --> 11:17.845
Freddy, is this great or what?

11:17.953 --> 11:21.889
Oh, yeah.
I could just eat your head right off!

11:22.391 --> 11:26.293
I mean... You know, it's fun up here.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.372
Pip?

11:38.774 --> 11:40.207
I'd go with the wood on this one.

12:02.264 --> 12:05.700
That's what I'm talking about!
Sweet mama!

12:06.101 --> 12:08.467
Hey, there's animals over there!

12:10.605 --> 12:12.470
Nice shoes.

12:12.741 --> 12:16.768
<i>Oh, doctor!</i>
<i>What a game we have here today!</i>

12:20.282 --> 12:21.476
Yeah!

12:22.017 --> 12:24.781
<i>He got the ball on the 30.</i>
<i>He's down on the 20. Lifts it up...</i>

12:24.886 --> 12:26.376
<i>It's a touchdown!</i>

12:26.488 --> 12:28.752
Yeah!

13:09.030 --> 13:10.258
Bacon!

13:10.699 --> 13:11.757
Hamburger!

13:11.867 --> 13:13.425
Chorizo!

13:13.535 --> 13:16.060
- Filet!
- What are you doing?

13:16.438 --> 13:19.874
I'm naming the kinds of cuts of meat
to the animal I'm jumping on.

13:19.975 --> 13:20.942
Machaca!

13:21.042 --> 13:22.202
Pork chops!

13:22.310 --> 13:24.175
Rump roast!

13:24.446 --> 13:27.108
You know what?
You don't need to be doing this.

13:27.249 --> 13:30.741
Oaty-oaty! Oaty-oaty!

13:31.486 --> 13:32.714
Hi, Oaty.

13:34.156 --> 13:36.556
Hey, Maddie. Looking good over there.

13:36.892 --> 13:38.951
Chubba Face, you crazy cow.

13:40.762 --> 13:42.457
Say, "I'm smooshy."

13:42.964 --> 13:45.194
I am smooshy.

13:46.902 --> 13:48.426
Okay, now you.

13:48.637 --> 13:50.571
Say, "Boy, is it windy."

13:51.540 --> 13:53.132
Boy, is it windy.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.342
My turn, my turn.

13:59.681 --> 14:02.206
- Okay, chick. Just run along now.
- Bye, Oaty.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.179
All righty.

14:09.257 --> 14:10.815
Hey, who is she?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.790
They just showed up.
Farmer took them in.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.590
Thank you, Farmer.

14:16.031 --> 14:17.931
Yeah, something happened
with their herd.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.126
They're the only two that made it.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.934
She needs a friend.

14:22.037 --> 14:23.561
Wait, wait, wait!

14:24.072 --> 14:27.007
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
notice you over there.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.673
Hey! Oh, look at you. You're all...

14:32.180 --> 14:34.774
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, sure. I mean...

14:34.883 --> 14:37.181
Really? 'Cause, I mean,
it isn't that noticeable, you know.

14:37.285 --> 14:39.014
I mean, especially when you
stand straight on,

14:39.120 --> 14:40.678
and you don't look at it.

14:40.789 --> 14:42.689
You know, when you turn to the side,
it gets a little lumpy.

14:42.791 --> 14:45.021
I mean glowy. Glowy. It's a glow.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.893
I'm... I'm Otis.

14:48.029 --> 14:51.931
Back off, Daisy.
There's an "L" on that boy's forehead.

14:52.067 --> 14:54.763
No, that's just me,
the contortion mouse.

14:56.705 --> 14:57.763
C!

14:57.873 --> 14:58.999
X!

14:59.107 --> 15:00.096
N!

15:00.208 --> 15:02.972
- Q!
- Oh, man, you're killing me, dude.

15:04.246 --> 15:07.579
Look, I just wanted to welcome you
to the barnyard.

15:07.816 --> 15:09.681
I'm sure that you and your...

15:10.151 --> 15:13.416
Not looking. The key word, "not".

15:13.521 --> 15:16.251
Work with me. Not looking.

15:17.325 --> 15:18.724
This is my friend, Bessy.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.488
Yeah, she's a cupcake.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.392
- It was nice to meet you, Otis.
- Yeah, too you.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.860
You know what? Switch those.

15:28.436 --> 15:29.801
Oh, boy.

15:29.905 --> 15:33.705
There's nothing for you there,
but I kind of like her friend.

15:54.896 --> 15:55.863
He's out!

16:01.269 --> 16:04.363
All clear! Sweet!

16:08.910 --> 16:12.346
<i>Now, every heifer, every cow</i>
<i>Hold tight to your udders now</i>

16:12.447 --> 16:15.439
<i>Farmer Brown is bedding down</i>
<i>Let's turn this barn into funky town</i>

16:15.550 --> 16:17.074
<i>Chickens on the left</i>
<i>Dance with your neighbor</i>

16:17.185 --> 16:17.285
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

16:17.320 --> 16:18.684
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

16:18.787 --> 16:22.780
<i>Try to go easy on the manure</i>
<i>It's a dance floor, not a sewer</i>

16:28.296 --> 16:31.732
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:34.127
Put this thing on hot!

16:34.536 --> 16:37.664
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

16:37.772 --> 16:40.206
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

16:40.976 --> 16:44.070
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

16:44.179 --> 16:47.273
<i>Darling, you better run</i>
<i>'Cause I won't hold back them horses</i>

16:47.382 --> 16:49.942
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:53.316
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

17:02.931 --> 17:04.489
<i>Here we go again</i>
<i>Come grab your friend</i>

17:04.598 --> 17:06.226
<i>Shake him up, shake him down</i>
<i>Try to get a good blend</i>

17:06.334 --> 17:08.598
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go</i>

17:10.070 --> 17:11.538
- <i>First you hold on tight</i>
- <i>Hold on tight</i>

17:11.638 --> 17:14.073
- <i>Then you dance all night</i>
- <i>Dance all night</i>

17:15.175 --> 17:16.336
<i>Hit the hay!</i>

17:16.444 --> 17:18.877
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

17:18.980 --> 17:21.210
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

17:21.883 --> 17:25.046
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

17:28.590 --> 17:31.320
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

17:31.426 --> 17:34.725
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

17:34.829 --> 17:37.821
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

17:37.932 --> 17:40.560
<i>With our backsides shaking</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

17:40.668 --> 17:42.568
Wow! This is amazing.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.110
What you looking at?

17:51.212 --> 17:52.804
What? You want some of this?

17:52.914 --> 17:54.711
Oh, yeah, I didn't think so.

17:55.483 --> 17:57.542
Sit right here, honey.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.677
The flowers are beautiful.

18:10.432 --> 18:13.629
See? On time, just like I...

18:13.735 --> 18:14.861
Right.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.931
Cramp! That's a cramp!

18:17.038 --> 18:18.528
Oh, it's cramping!

18:23.111 --> 18:24.806
And release.

18:24.913 --> 18:27.245
- Hello, Son.
- Dad,

18:28.450 --> 18:29.883
I've been thinking,

18:30.318 --> 18:32.377
and I'm willing to accept your apology.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.615
- Really?
- Sure. I mean, it's only right. I mean...

18:38.359 --> 18:39.417
Okay.

18:40.695 --> 18:44.995
I don't mean to let you down, Pop.
I'm just out trying to have some fun.

18:47.235 --> 18:49.135
It's a beautiful night.

18:49.237 --> 18:52.331
I remember when I used to
sit out here with your sister.

18:52.574 --> 18:54.633
- I don't have a sister.
- Oh, yeah.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.041
That was you, wasn't it?

18:58.613 --> 18:59.637
Thank you, all right.

19:00.482 --> 19:01.972
So, are we okay?

19:02.984 --> 19:04.417
- We're okay.
- Great.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.713
See, 'cause I wanted
to ask you something.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.617
My friends are all going
to the barn tonight,

19:07.722 --> 19:09.917
and not that it matters either way to me,

19:10.024 --> 19:11.082
but evidently, I'm needed.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.353
I'm a sort of an integral part
of a musical number.

19:13.461 --> 19:16.362
Yeah, I tried to tell them no, you know?
But they were just so...

19:16.464 --> 19:19.024
I told them, "My dad's not gonna
wanna cover my shift.

19:19.134 --> 19:23.002
"I mean, it's my shift, not his.
It isn't his!" You know?

19:23.104 --> 19:26.267
"I don't want to be selfish.
What's mine is mine, and..."

19:27.242 --> 19:28.334
What do you think?

19:30.145 --> 19:31.305
Otis...

19:35.850 --> 19:38.648
I never thought
I was gonna amount to much.

19:39.287 --> 19:42.688
I certainly didn't think
I'd be in charge of anything.

19:43.424 --> 19:45.585
But that all changed one day.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.589
It was the day you showed up.

19:49.697 --> 19:51.358
I head out into the meadow

19:51.466 --> 19:54.333
and I see this little baby calf all alone,

19:54.936 --> 19:56.528
stumbling around.

19:56.838 --> 19:59.500
You know,
before you became a nightmare.

20:00.975 --> 20:03.569
Well, I took you home that night,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.238
and I know it doesn't sound possible,

20:08.416 --> 20:10.509
but I looked up into the sky

20:11.119 --> 20:13.246
and I would have swore

20:13.354 --> 20:15.584
I saw the stars dance.

20:17.292 --> 20:20.227
At that moment,
I knew my place was here,

20:20.929 --> 20:22.760
taking care of things.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.733
I guess you helped me realize that.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.393
I love you, Son.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.966
- You still want to go, don't you?
- Yeah, I really do.

20:34.075 --> 20:37.704
Not that your stuff... You know, the stuff
you're saying isn't nifty and everything...

20:37.812 --> 20:39.370
No one says "nifty".

20:39.480 --> 20:42.244
I say "nifty." I do, and sometimes
even "swifty." I'll say that.

20:42.350 --> 20:43.908
Very impressive.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.049
Go ahead, have fun. I'll cover your shift.

20:47.422 --> 20:49.117
Thanks, Pop. You're the best.

20:49.224 --> 20:50.623
- Otis?
- Yeah?

20:50.725 --> 20:52.420
Be the stronger man.

20:52.527 --> 20:54.392
Yeah. Yeah, that's
that saying thing, right?

20:54.495 --> 20:56.224
"A strong man stands up for himself.

20:56.331 --> 20:59.323
"A stronger man can
bridge the gap between..."

20:59.434 --> 21:01.527
Got it locked in the vault.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.271
See? I learn.

21:17.051 --> 21:19.110
<i>Mr. Boombastic</i>

21:20.255 --> 21:24.419
<i>What you want is a boombastic</i>
<i>Romantic, fantastic lover</i>

21:24.525 --> 21:28.086
<i>She call me Mr. Boombastic</i>
<i>Say me fantastic</i>

21:28.196 --> 21:32.223
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Romantic</i>

21:32.333 --> 21:34.198
<i>Call me fantastic</i>

21:34.302 --> 21:37.169
<i>Touch me in me back</i>
<i>She says I'm Mr. Ro...</i>

21:37.605 --> 21:39.163
<i>Smooth</i>

21:39.274 --> 21:42.368
Who's here? Moo! It's me! Moo!

21:42.477 --> 21:45.378
Whassup? Milk me!

21:45.480 --> 21:46.777
Hey, babe.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.111
My barn. That's right, my barn.

21:55.490 --> 21:57.549
You're late. Come on.

21:57.659 --> 21:59.752
He's a real winner, that one.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.352
Oh, stop. I think he's kind of cute.

22:02.463 --> 22:04.829
<i>Lay down in my Jacuzzi</i>
<i>and get some bubble bath</i>

22:04.966 --> 22:07.799
<i>Only sound you will hear</i>
<i>is the beating of my heart</i>

22:07.902 --> 22:10.837
<i>And we will mmm-mmm</i>
<i>And have some sweet pillow talk</i>

22:10.938 --> 22:16.240
<i>I'm Boombastic, really fantastic</i>
<i>Mr. Boom Boom Boom Boom</i>

22:16.744 --> 22:20.908
Give it up for the one and only,
Biggy Cheese!

22:21.316 --> 22:23.716
We're gonna have some fun
tonight, y'all.

22:23.918 --> 22:26.409
Hey, Buck.
Get your hooves off the stage.

22:26.621 --> 22:28.680
You ain't in show business.

22:32.627 --> 22:35.357
What, were you raised in a barn?

22:40.201 --> 22:42.192
Well, you're a good horse. Okay...

22:43.104 --> 22:45.299
What you looking at, Turkey?

22:47.942 --> 22:50.103
Somebody pass me
the cranberry sauce.

22:51.713 --> 22:53.704
Dead turkey walking.

22:54.015 --> 22:56.108
We all gonna die,
but we don't know the date.

22:56.217 --> 22:58.515
We know your date, Thanksgiving!

23:03.191 --> 23:06.957
Okay, to kick things off tonight,
I got a special treat.

23:07.061 --> 23:09.029
Back by popular demand.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.564
Ladies, this one's for you.

23:11.666 --> 23:15.432
Our own Otis and the Crew!

23:22.510 --> 23:25.377
<i>Well, down on the farm</i>

23:26.414 --> 23:29.247
<i>Where they all ask for you</i>

23:35.656 --> 23:37.954
Parties all hours of the night.

23:39.761 --> 23:43.390
What is that farmer up to?
You know what?

23:43.531 --> 23:46.159
- I'm gonna call someone.
- Oh, leave him be.

23:46.267 --> 23:49.236
Well, I'll just call whoever I want,
whenever I want to.

23:49.337 --> 23:50.929
That's exactly what I'll do.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.973
Because I know
what a rave is, Mr. Lump.

23:54.075 --> 23:57.374
"I'm going to sit and watch TV
and be a lump."

23:57.478 --> 24:01.141
Okay, Mr. Lumpy. It's just not right.

24:03.084 --> 24:05.882
<i>They all ask for you</i>

24:07.054 --> 24:09.716
<i>They all ask for you</i>

24:10.591 --> 24:12.923
<i>Down on the farm</i>

24:14.629 --> 24:21.432
<i>They all ask for you</i>

24:40.755 --> 24:42.222
I'll check it.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.253
It's all right. Calm down.
It's just the pizza guy.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.852
I'm on it.

24:49.964 --> 24:51.556
Watch out. I got it. I got it.

24:51.666 --> 24:53.133
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

24:58.573 --> 25:01.133
Thanks. You want change?

25:01.242 --> 25:02.573
No, keep it.

25:02.677 --> 25:05.339
So, you really ordered a lot of pizzas.

25:05.780 --> 25:08.374
Well, yes.
We're having a big human party.

25:08.483 --> 25:10.383
Just a party. A big one.

25:10.485 --> 25:13.682
With us celebrating our humanness.

25:13.855 --> 25:16.585
- Dude, I love parties! Can I...
- No.

25:17.925 --> 25:20.860
Okay. Well, then, I'll see you.

25:27.502 --> 25:28.560
Ouch!

25:29.837 --> 25:31.304
My arm fell off.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.669
My fake arm, I mean.

25:34.375 --> 25:38.141
Wow, I am so sorry about that.

25:38.246 --> 25:40.840
- Do you need any help?
- No, I don't like help.

25:42.149 --> 25:46.210
It's just against my religion.
I'm a Nohelpian.

25:48.322 --> 25:50.517
Cool, I'm a Lutheran.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.386
What about this?

25:52.493 --> 25:54.927
You know what? You keep it.
It's dirty now.

25:55.396 --> 25:56.920
Really? All right.

25:57.031 --> 25:59.226
Dude, I got a arm!

25:59.967 --> 26:02.367
Yeah! Righteous!

26:27.695 --> 26:30.960
<i>Well, I won't back down</i>

26:32.066 --> 26:35.365
<i>No, I won't back down</i>

26:36.370 --> 26:40.602
<i>You can stand me up</i>
<i>at the gates of hell</i>

26:40.708 --> 26:43.836
<i>But I won't back down</i>

26:44.879 --> 26:48.440
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

26:49.250 --> 26:52.708
<i>Won't be turned around</i>

26:53.421 --> 26:57.482
<i>And I'll keep this world</i>
<i>from dragging me down</i>

26:57.625 --> 27:00.890
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

27:56.017 --> 27:57.780
Good evening, ladies.

27:58.486 --> 28:00.147
Sorry to call on you
so late in the evening,

28:00.254 --> 28:02.347
but we did have a previous engagement.

28:07.161 --> 28:08.822
Now, we're gonna take six of you.

28:08.929 --> 28:11.727
Anyone makes a sound,
we don't mind the extra company.

28:11.832 --> 28:14.096
Boys, take your pick.

28:14.468 --> 28:17.028
You won't be taking any hens tonight.

28:19.507 --> 28:21.600
And you're gonna stop us?

28:22.309 --> 28:27.178
Is that what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna stop us, hen?

28:27.281 --> 28:29.613
How are you gonna do that?

28:33.020 --> 28:35.614
No, he is.

28:39.493 --> 28:42.360
Ben. How are you, Ben?

28:42.630 --> 28:45.030
We would've said hello,
had we seen you.

28:45.132 --> 28:46.963
Put the hen down, Dag.

28:47.501 --> 28:50.800
Sure, Ben. Whatever you say.

28:51.338 --> 28:54.034
We're just doing a little courting,
that's all.

28:54.141 --> 28:56.632
You know how much we like the hens.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.678
You know me, ladykiller.

29:02.516 --> 29:05.644
You have us
at a bit of a disadvantage here, Ben.

29:06.187 --> 29:07.779
There's six of us,

29:08.289 --> 29:11.781
and only one old, fat you.

29:48.229 --> 29:50.789
Oh, baby! Party time!

31:04.371 --> 31:05.429
Otis!

31:06.106 --> 31:07.073
Otis!

31:11.212 --> 31:13.442
Otis! Otis!

31:14.048 --> 31:15.481
It's Ben.

31:23.357 --> 31:26.793
Oh, no. No, no.

33:10.497 --> 33:13.466
Yeah. You hang on there, buddy.

33:22.443 --> 33:24.570
All right now, Otis. Just lift.

33:24.678 --> 33:27.738
Ten and two. Ten and two.

33:29.316 --> 33:32.843
Not like that. Now lift, and two.

33:34.088 --> 33:35.385
You dog!

33:40.127 --> 33:41.890
Come here, fisherman.

33:56.710 --> 33:59.907
What do we do now? Who's gonna
protect us from the coyotes?

34:00.247 --> 34:02.238
Anybody got a pistol?

34:02.783 --> 34:05.274
Order, here! Hey, am I bothering you?

34:05.386 --> 34:07.377
Let's get this meeting started.

34:07.488 --> 34:10.013
- Duke, who's gonna run the meeting?
- That's what the meeting's about.

34:10.123 --> 34:12.820
The meeting's about
finding someone to run the meeting?

34:12.926 --> 34:14.393
Is that a good idea?

34:14.495 --> 34:15.928
We should take a meeting about it.

34:16.030 --> 34:18.328
Someone has to do this.
We don't have Ben.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.230
Therefore, I would like
to nominate myself.

34:22.969 --> 34:24.460
Dogs are... Listen to me.

34:24.571 --> 34:27.665
Dogs are watchful,
they're loyal, and very protective.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.208
And they lick themselves.

34:29.309 --> 34:30.708
I don't want a leader who licks himself.

34:30.811 --> 34:32.072
- Me, neither.
- That's nasty.

34:32.179 --> 34:33.203
I can't even reach mine.

34:33.313 --> 34:34.678
I don't do that.

34:35.882 --> 34:36.975
Anymore.

34:37.083 --> 34:40.349
One time, I was bored,
lonely, and a little snackish.

34:40.521 --> 34:42.512
Yeah, I saw you drink
out of a toilet once.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.888
- Hey, you drink potty water.
- You drink potty water!

34:46.493 --> 34:50.190
My bowl was empty, my friend.
Come on, we're getting off track here.

34:51.197 --> 34:54.793
Duke, with all respect,
I think there are certain traits

34:54.902 --> 34:57.370
that would make you unqualified
to be leader.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.961
Yeah, such as?

35:08.849 --> 35:10.180
Your point?

35:10.484 --> 35:12.645
Hey, come on, I do that for fun,

35:13.187 --> 35:15.553
not 'cause I have to. Go on!

35:27.835 --> 35:31.794
So, big deal. I fetch balls.
One little flaw.

35:41.882 --> 35:46.046
This doesn't mean anything.

35:48.989 --> 35:52.618
All right, all right, let's take a vote.
Come on, let's take a vote here.

35:52.726 --> 35:55.456
All those in favor
of me being the new leader.

36:01.468 --> 36:02.662
Those opposed?

36:04.705 --> 36:07.173
- Can you see my hand?
- Listen now, listen up.

36:07.274 --> 36:11.074
You all know that Ben always
intended for Otis to take his place.

36:11.178 --> 36:13.169
All right, Otis is in charge.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.441
I second that motion. Sweet!

36:21.421 --> 36:22.752
Here we go.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.826
Try and catch me.

36:28.929 --> 36:30.396
Stay in line.

36:30.497 --> 36:32.863
Maddie, we don't want to lose you.

36:47.981 --> 36:50.279
Oh, I think that would be just fine.

36:51.885 --> 36:53.910
Oaty-oaty! Hey, Oaty!

36:58.692 --> 37:02.423
Hey, Maddie, now really isn't a good...

37:02.930 --> 37:06.229
What are you doing?
Would you stop? Come on.

37:07.067 --> 37:09.900
Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys...

37:10.003 --> 37:12.369
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- What is it? What is it?

37:28.288 --> 37:31.018
Otis, it's a madhouse! Isn't it just great?

37:33.760 --> 37:35.728
You got hit with a soccer ball.

37:55.382 --> 37:58.215
I thought I'd be the first
to congratulate you, Otis.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.752
- You're in charge now.
- I'm what?

38:01.521 --> 38:03.455
Miles, I am not in charge, okay?

38:03.557 --> 38:07.049
I don't do "In charge".

38:07.728 --> 38:10.196
- This is not my responsibility.
- I hear you.

38:10.297 --> 38:12.925
But you were elected fair and square.

38:13.767 --> 38:15.598
Congratulations, boss.

38:19.573 --> 38:20.904
Hey!

38:25.145 --> 38:27.238
Have you all lost your mind?

38:27.614 --> 38:30.344
It's daylight.
The Farmer's gonna be back.

38:30.450 --> 38:33.749
This is so off limits.

38:34.521 --> 38:35.988
Come on, Otis,

38:38.125 --> 38:40.559
I know your weak spot.

38:41.228 --> 38:43.196
Wild Mike!

38:43.664 --> 38:45.928
- What?
- Wild Mike.

38:46.266 --> 38:49.793
Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

38:49.903 --> 38:51.370
- Wild Mike.
- I'm not doing this, okay?

38:51.471 --> 38:53.029
- There's no way this is happening.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.903
- Everybody just get back to your...
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

38:55.008 --> 38:58.671
- Return to your designated quadrants.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

38:59.613 --> 39:02.810
Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

39:02.949 --> 39:04.644
- This is ridiculous!
- Wild Mike!

39:04.751 --> 39:08.084
I'm not gonna dance
just because you're getting Wild Mike.

39:08.588 --> 39:10.351
- Pip, help me out here.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

39:10.457 --> 39:14.723
You can't fight it, Otis.
You're a born party animal.

39:15.195 --> 39:18.926
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

39:19.032 --> 39:22.331
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

39:27.908 --> 39:29.842
Let's boogie!

39:35.182 --> 39:37.776
<i>We're heading for the West</i>
<i>Not heading for the East</i>

39:37.884 --> 39:41.183
<i>We're gonna live our dream</i>
<i>'Cause we're wild and free</i>

39:41.288 --> 39:42.880
Look at that freaky thing.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.854
What kind of animal is that?

39:44.958 --> 39:47.449
I don't know, but he sure can dance.

40:02.275 --> 40:05.506
I say, let's kill it.
Give me that piece of wood over there.

40:18.091 --> 40:21.458
Sweet legs! Get the sweet legs!
I got the sweet legs!

41:05.806 --> 41:06.830
Moo?

41:09.042 --> 41:10.532
What did you do that for?

41:10.644 --> 41:13.078
What else was I gonna do? He saw you.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.205
You could have killed him!

41:18.952 --> 41:20.442
I got a pulse.

41:22.823 --> 41:26.281
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
This is so bad.

41:26.393 --> 41:27.792
Baaad.

41:27.894 --> 41:31.921
Everybody, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

41:32.032 --> 41:35.195
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

41:37.871 --> 41:38.895
What?

41:39.005 --> 41:41.166
Come on. You're our leader. Lead us.

41:41.274 --> 41:43.401
That does not apply to this.

41:43.510 --> 41:47.378
This is a totally, situationally
different suspect.

41:47.914 --> 41:49.404
Hey, whoa, no.

41:49.516 --> 41:52.246
- We gotta ditch the body.
- Stop it!

41:52.352 --> 41:55.480
He knows too much.
We gotta take care of him.

41:55.589 --> 41:59.116
- We gotta whack him.
- There will be no whacking, okay?

41:59.226 --> 42:01.421
The Farmer's a good guy.
He's been good to us.

42:01.528 --> 42:03.723
He's a vegan, God bless him.

42:03.830 --> 42:06.993
And what is a vegan, again?

42:07.100 --> 42:08.192
I know this one.

42:08.301 --> 42:10.667
No, I got it. It means
you can't eat anything with a face.

42:10.770 --> 42:12.465
No, no, no, that's a vegetarian.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.540
Vegetarians have to eat
in the dark, right?

42:14.641 --> 42:16.268
That's a vampire. Come on.

42:16.376 --> 42:17.468
You can't eat cheese?

42:17.577 --> 42:20.978
It's not just cheese.
Vegans can't have any dairy products.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.810
- Cake?
- Cake has egg products.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.406
But you can't have any dairy.

42:25.151 --> 42:28.882
No dairy? I love dairy.
Does that mean I can't be a vegan?

42:28.989 --> 42:31.685
I love the smell of bacon.
There, I said it.

42:36.062 --> 42:37.256
Would you not do that?

42:37.364 --> 42:39.889
It's not like we have a lot of options.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.458
Boy, that's a doozy.
That thing's bigger than me.

42:43.570 --> 42:44.559
Push it.

42:44.671 --> 42:47.504
- He wakes up, you got my back, right?
- Yeah.

42:55.081 --> 42:56.343
Come on. Come on.

42:56.449 --> 43:00.681
Okay, watch this. Off his nose,
on the belly, on the floor. Check it.

43:08.895 --> 43:10.021
Book.

43:18.438 --> 43:20.838
Okay, now.
He was sitting here, he was reading.

43:20.941 --> 43:24.138
- Something fell on his head, and...
- I got it.

43:29.749 --> 43:31.512
Too light.
Couldn't cause a bump like that.

43:31.618 --> 43:33.142
I bet it could.

43:34.654 --> 43:37.487
Would you cut it out?
We need something bigger.

43:37.591 --> 43:39.388
Can I have the apple?

43:41.695 --> 43:43.492
What's with the look?

44:00.113 --> 44:01.637
He's buying it.

44:03.116 --> 44:04.845
He's not buying it.

44:06.353 --> 44:07.877
He's buying it.

44:08.722 --> 44:10.417
He's not buying it.

44:11.391 --> 44:13.951
No, he's buying it.

44:30.477 --> 44:33.878
Will you stop doing that?

44:33.980 --> 44:38.041
Well, unless you get him a blindfold,
I'm going to kick him!

44:38.718 --> 44:40.242
Okay, let's go.

44:59.939 --> 45:02.032
There. See? Good as new.

45:02.142 --> 45:04.337
I'll tell you,
this being in charge thing isn't so tough.

45:04.444 --> 45:08.073
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

45:19.259 --> 45:22.854
Yeah, hi. Hey, there.
Having a good day? Yeah.

45:24.397 --> 45:26.991
So, this was Otis's idea?

45:27.100 --> 45:30.126
Oh, yeah.
We're like the second line of defense.

45:30.236 --> 45:34.900
We see or hear anything suspicious,
and I just signal Otis with a crow.

45:35.008 --> 45:38.375
And I've really been
working on it. Listen.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.652
Well, you know, in the moment,
it'll be really strong.

45:49.756 --> 45:52.350
But for now, we just stand watch.

45:52.459 --> 45:54.450
Yeah, watch.

46:04.504 --> 46:06.267
Come and get it!

46:06.873 --> 46:08.864
Freddy, you okay?

46:08.975 --> 46:11.876
Boneless white meat!
What? I'm not hungry!

46:11.978 --> 46:15.175
I mean, I don't wanna eat anyone...
Thing... You...

46:15.281 --> 46:17.613
What happened? What? What? What?

46:21.921 --> 46:26.722
Okay, quick little once
around the barnyard, then, hello, party!

46:33.466 --> 46:37.493
Hey, look at this.
It's our new inside connection.

46:38.204 --> 46:39.796
Congrats, Otis.

46:40.774 --> 46:42.935
Oh, will you look at that?

46:46.646 --> 46:48.511
Don't wake up the cow.

46:59.659 --> 47:01.684
That's called cowtipping.

47:05.832 --> 47:07.857
Oh, that so steams me!

47:08.101 --> 47:10.365
Man, I wish I could get
a hold of that little... I would...

47:10.470 --> 47:12.665
Hey, I'm in charge, right?

47:12.772 --> 47:16.071
Oh, we are so talking.
Are we not talking?

47:16.176 --> 47:19.577
- Talking the talk and walking the walk.
- Walkie-talkie, huh?

47:19.679 --> 47:20.668
Let's go.

47:21.114 --> 47:24.208
Then I said, "That's called cowtipping."

47:32.759 --> 47:35.956
I hear music over there again.
Do you hear music?

47:36.329 --> 47:38.490
That farmer's out of control.

47:39.098 --> 47:42.158
We should call someone.
We should call someone.

47:44.204 --> 47:45.967
- I smell buttermilk.
- Shut up! Shut up!

47:46.072 --> 47:48.666
- What's that smell?
- Stop it! Stop it!

48:00.553 --> 48:02.885
Randall, there is a cow outside.

48:04.457 --> 48:07.585
This is a cow farm.
You're gonna find cows outside.

48:07.694 --> 48:09.491
No, I mean right outside.

48:09.596 --> 48:14.192
Right outside this house,
looming like a ghost. Like a reaper.

48:14.300 --> 48:17.428
No, cows don't like houses much.

48:17.770 --> 48:21.900
They prefer it out in the meadow,
where they can get a graze on.

48:22.308 --> 48:26.210
Nathan Randall the Third,
I am not crazy.

48:26.579 --> 48:29.309
I am medicated
for a chemical imbalance.

48:29.716 --> 48:33.379
Don't you sit there
and think that I am crazy.

48:35.488 --> 48:38.082
Your mind's gone, woman.

48:38.191 --> 48:40.853
Where'd it go? I don't know.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.587
It's gone.

48:46.566 --> 48:49.467
- Oh geez, you're on my foot again.
- Sorry.

48:49.569 --> 48:52.834
This is so sweet.
This is so wicked sweet.

48:52.939 --> 48:54.804
I love the new you, Otis.

48:54.908 --> 48:57.172
Okay, Igg,
you remember how to do this?

48:57.277 --> 48:58.869
- Oh, he remembers.
- I remember.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.639
- Yeah, he remembers.
- He's remembering.

49:00.747 --> 49:01.771
Right now.

49:17.497 --> 49:20.796
Well, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Here is a first.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.232
Otis joining us on a joyride.

49:23.336 --> 49:27.602
- That's the animal sin of sins, huh?
- "Sin of sins," I like that.

49:27.707 --> 49:29.971
Hey, old Bud. Bud, you bring the stuff?

49:30.076 --> 49:32.670
It's right here.

49:32.779 --> 49:35.373
- Show it. Show it.
- It's right here.

49:35.481 --> 49:36.778
- Show it.
- It's right here.

49:36.883 --> 49:38.475
- Show it.
- It's right there.

49:41.421 --> 49:43.787
We're rebels! We're rebels!

49:43.890 --> 49:45.551
We're the wildest!

49:45.959 --> 49:47.517
There they are.

49:52.598 --> 49:55.362
- Too bad we can't go in there.
- Yeah.

49:55.468 --> 49:57.060
Breaks my heart.

50:05.745 --> 50:07.770
Now remember, honey, I told you,

50:07.880 --> 50:10.542
we can't be staying out this late
on a school night.

50:11.317 --> 50:13.410
"We can't be staying out late."

50:16.155 --> 50:18.419
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

50:18.891 --> 50:22.759
Do what I want, when I want,
'cause I want to do it.

50:26.632 --> 50:28.964
You've come to the wrong place.

50:37.343 --> 50:39.368
- What is that?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

50:39.479 --> 50:42.107
- Oh, man.
- Here we go. I know.

50:42.448 --> 50:44.848
- One, two...
- Yeah.

50:44.951 --> 50:46.043
Two, yeah.

50:46.319 --> 50:47.752
Moo!

50:53.259 --> 50:55.693
That's called boytipping!

51:01.534 --> 51:03.502
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on, move it!

51:03.603 --> 51:05.366
Let me out!

51:06.372 --> 51:08.237
Okay, go!

51:14.981 --> 51:16.676
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

51:16.783 --> 51:18.842
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

51:18.951 --> 51:20.612
Treat cows nicely.

51:20.820 --> 51:22.720
Okay, no more Red Bull.

51:28.461 --> 51:32.124
Put crowns on our heads,
'cause we are the kings!

51:42.608 --> 51:44.337
Did you see his face?

51:44.444 --> 51:45.570
- Price...
- Less.

51:45.678 --> 51:46.667
- Price...
- Less.

51:46.779 --> 51:47.746
- Pr...
- Ice...

51:47.847 --> 51:48.836
Less.

51:51.451 --> 51:54.545
A toast! To a new world order.

51:54.654 --> 51:56.918
We are calling the shots now!

51:57.023 --> 51:59.423
- Yeah, it's all about us now.
- You've got that right, Otis.

51:59.525 --> 52:01.823
Nothing can touch us.

52:04.363 --> 52:05.955
Oh, man! Oh, man!

52:06.065 --> 52:07.760
- Oh, man!
- Man, oh, man!

52:07.867 --> 52:09.664
Let me out! You gotta let me out!

52:09.769 --> 52:13.068
<i>Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

52:13.372 --> 52:15.135
Oh, no, they're talking to us now.

52:15.241 --> 52:17.300
Pull over! You gotta pull over!

52:17.410 --> 52:19.139
We can't pull over!

52:19.245 --> 52:20.507
Hang on!

52:20.613 --> 52:22.808
What could be worse than this?

52:24.517 --> 52:26.849
What we got here
is probably some teenagers

52:26.953 --> 52:29.478
going out for a joyride
in their mom's car.

52:29.589 --> 52:32.922
Yeah, we'll shake them up a bit,
send them home. You know kids.

52:33.025 --> 52:36.085
Nothing a little strip search
won't cure, yeah.

52:37.296 --> 52:39.161
Is this thing still on?

52:39.365 --> 52:40.764
Is that a camera?

52:40.867 --> 52:42.198
- This is it. Goodbye.
- They're taping <i>Cops.</i>

52:42.301 --> 52:45.998
Mommy! Mooo-mmy!

52:46.105 --> 52:49.973
Hey, relax. We can lose them.
I mean, it's just a car, right?

52:50.309 --> 52:53.244
It's a chopper! It's a chopper!

52:53.679 --> 52:55.647
We're gonna die!

52:55.748 --> 52:59.343
<i>We interrupt this program with</i>
<i>a breaking news story. Police are in...</i>

52:59.452 --> 53:02.478
Would you look at that?
The world is going crazy.

53:02.588 --> 53:06.922
These kids get all hopped up on
Diet Coke and Jolly Ranchers and just...

53:07.627 --> 53:08.889
That's our car!

53:10.463 --> 53:15.025
That was a hoof.
There's a cow in our car! That is a hoof!

53:22.275 --> 53:24.334
Yes, this is Nora Beady.

53:24.443 --> 53:26.308
What do you mean, "What now?"

53:26.412 --> 53:30.348
My car is on TV,
and I think there's a cow in it.

53:30.449 --> 53:34.317
And I saw a cow outside my window.
I think they may be linked.

53:35.621 --> 53:38.021
Don't think I can't call again, Gary.

53:42.228 --> 53:43.957
Oh, that's nice. Good.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.563
They're gonna catch us
and they're gonna dissect us.

53:50.102 --> 53:51.865
We are ditching out!

54:02.181 --> 54:05.810
Two all-beef patties, that's our future!

54:10.489 --> 54:11.683
Out! Run!

54:11.791 --> 54:13.759
- Run!
- Stop touching me!

54:14.961 --> 54:16.929
They're making a run for it. Let's go.
Come on.

54:17.029 --> 54:20.863
<i>This is Gray Badger in Chopper 219.</i>
<i>We've got suspects in sight.</i>

54:21.567 --> 54:23.194
I'm chafing!

54:23.502 --> 54:25.561
Okay. Hurry up, fellows.
They're right over there.

54:25.671 --> 54:26.763
Oh, milk me!

54:26.872 --> 54:27.896
Okay, here we go! Here we go!

54:28.007 --> 54:28.996
Milk me!

54:29.108 --> 54:30.439
Geez, these guys are big.

54:30.543 --> 54:31.703
I see them over there.

54:31.811 --> 54:33.278
Cut it right!

54:37.850 --> 54:39.408
We got them!

54:58.504 --> 55:01.641
Could you guys believe that?
Did you guys see me?

55:02.375 --> 55:04.240
Me, I am fearless, baby.

55:04.343 --> 55:06.402
- Oh, yeah, fear...
- Less.

55:06.746 --> 55:08.941
I think I rolled over my foot.

55:09.715 --> 55:12.240
We left it the same way we found it.

55:17.189 --> 55:21.626
Okay, toodle-oo, Otis.
Same time tomorrow night?

55:21.994 --> 55:25.657
Hey, guys, can you imagine
Ben doing something like that?

55:27.266 --> 55:29.131
- No way. No way.
- We'd be in trouble.

55:29.235 --> 55:30.668
- Trou...
- Ble.

55:52.058 --> 55:55.323
Okay, explain to me exactly
why are we doing this?

55:55.428 --> 55:57.555
Because it's what my dad would do.

55:57.663 --> 56:00.063
Why don't you just go have fun,
all right? I can do this.

56:00.166 --> 56:02.862
No way. We're homeboys.
I'm here with you.

56:03.002 --> 56:04.299
Really, it's all right.

56:04.403 --> 56:06.462
Okay, I tried! Later, dude.

56:06.572 --> 56:09.541
I'll bring you back a drink or something.
Be back.

56:16.315 --> 56:19.375
Come on back, I'm right here.

56:20.086 --> 56:21.246
Mind if I join you?

56:21.354 --> 56:25.313
No. I mean, sure. I no mind you...

56:25.591 --> 56:27.252
Geez, I can't even talk to you!

56:28.861 --> 56:30.522
Hang on a second.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.795
Here. You know, just let me...

56:36.902 --> 56:39.666
No, I can still sit on my own, I think.

56:40.673 --> 56:43.608
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, the baby's coming!

56:43.709 --> 56:44.801
What?

56:45.745 --> 56:47.337
I made you jump.

56:47.813 --> 56:50.907
Nice. Nice. Thank you.
I about swallowed my cud.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.554
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- My cud?

56:57.723 --> 57:01.215
- The night.
- Yeah, that, too. Yeah, it's nice.

57:04.397 --> 57:06.661
My dad had a thing about stars.

57:08.167 --> 57:10.795
- Tell me, what was he like?
- My pop?

57:11.437 --> 57:14.270
He was amazing.
Bigger than life, you know?

57:14.673 --> 57:16.868
Funny, we're not even related.

57:17.176 --> 57:19.838
He found me and he took me in.

57:21.180 --> 57:25.014
I never thought about it before,
but everything he did was for me.

57:26.385 --> 57:28.080
He's the only family I've ever known.

57:30.089 --> 57:33.286
The last time we talked,
he told me that the night he found me

57:33.392 --> 57:38.329
he looked up into the sky
and he said that the stars...

57:41.567 --> 57:43.091
God, I miss him.

57:46.772 --> 57:50.230
What about you?
I mean, if that's too personal, you know.

57:50.342 --> 57:53.436
If I'm overstepping like a boundary or...

57:54.313 --> 57:56.474
You know what? Too bad. Cough it up.

57:56.582 --> 57:57.674
Okay.

57:59.585 --> 58:01.485
Well, where do I start?

58:02.521 --> 58:05.979
I was married, and life was good.

58:08.594 --> 58:11.427
Yeah. It seems like
forever ago now, but...

58:11.997 --> 58:14.295
One day, a bad storm rolled in.

58:15.267 --> 58:19.397
Bessy and I were in the meadow
and we found a place on high ground.

58:20.773 --> 58:22.638
But when we went home,

58:24.176 --> 58:27.976
well, everyone was gone.

58:31.884 --> 58:33.317
You know what I think?

58:33.419 --> 58:36.320
I think some good things are gonna
start happening to you and me.

59:41.520 --> 59:44.045
What, do you wanna be a hero, cow?

59:58.904 --> 01:00:01.464
Hey, you're Ben's kid.

01:00:02.174 --> 01:00:03.732
Otis, right?

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.304
So they left you in charge?

01:00:09.615 --> 01:00:11.378
Oh, that's precious.

01:00:13.118 --> 01:00:15.712
You thought you could fill his shoes?

01:00:17.523 --> 01:00:19.718
Otis, where were you?

01:00:20.192 --> 01:00:25.129
Were you off having fun?
Laughing with your barnyard buddies?

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.721
Yeah, you could have made a difference
had you been there for him,

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:28.959
but you weren't. Were you?

01:00:30.202 --> 01:00:34.263
Okay, from here on out,
this is the way it's gonna work.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:38.534
We show up, you look the other way.

01:00:38.877 --> 01:00:41.505
A few animals missing here and there.

01:00:41.614 --> 01:00:44.549
Hey, it's the natural order of things.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:47.110
It'll be our little secret.

01:00:47.753 --> 01:00:50.313
Oh, and Ben's kid,

01:00:50.422 --> 01:00:54.017
if you should think about getting
a sudden burst of courage,

01:00:54.126 --> 01:00:56.617
we slaughter every animal in sight.

01:00:56.729 --> 01:00:59.789
Now, you go back,
make everyone feel all safe,

01:00:59.898 --> 01:01:03.334
and we'll be seeing you tomorrow night.
That's a date.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.228
See you around.

01:01:09.742 --> 01:01:11.676
"Round." You're fat.

01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:17.003
Hey, Pop.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:20.745
I wanted to come by and...

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.751
Look, you were just a great dad.

01:02:29.188 --> 01:02:30.678
You see, I...

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:35.784
I don't know what I was thinking,
but, for a minute, I actually thought

01:02:35.894 --> 01:02:37.862
I could take your place.

01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:41.262
But those coyotes?

01:02:42.101 --> 01:02:45.662
I mean, you'd have stood up to them
and you wouldn't have backed down.

01:02:47.473 --> 01:02:50.442
I gotta tell you, I was so afraid.

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:57.209
You know, I know I always said
that I wasn't you, and I'm not.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.410
But I wish I was.

01:03:03.455 --> 01:03:05.184
I can't do it, Pop.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.189
I gotta go.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.691
I'm sorry.

01:03:19.238 --> 01:03:21.433
And Duke will handle things,
and everything will be fine.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.805
Wait. What are you talking about?

01:03:24.943 --> 01:03:26.706
Could you just not say anything?

01:03:26.812 --> 01:03:29.713
Okay, I don't want to make
a big thing about this.

01:03:29.815 --> 01:03:33.478
Hey, everybody!
Otis is leaving the barnyard!

01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:37.085
- What's going on?
- I don't believe it.

01:03:43.996 --> 01:03:45.691
Oat, seriously,

01:03:45.798 --> 01:03:50.098
I mean, you and me,
we're like best friends.

01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:51.931
No, Pip. It's over!

01:03:52.404 --> 01:03:55.931
I'm leaving, all right? No big whoop.
Continue your day.

01:03:56.441 --> 01:03:58.466
Come on, Otis, we'll do what you say.

01:03:58.577 --> 01:04:00.545
That's the point.
I don't want you to do what I say.

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:02.443
I don't want any of you
to have to listen to me.

01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:04.311
Don't listen to him!

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:07.015
Stop doing what I say!

01:04:08.187 --> 01:04:13.090
Okay, so what you're saying is,
you'll stay if we don't do what you say.

01:04:13.192 --> 01:04:14.386
Dead bee.

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.157
Thanks.

01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:18.686
Again, alive.

01:04:18.797 --> 01:04:21.231
Duke, you're in charge.
Get the dogs together.

01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:23.426
You guys can handle things
better than I ever could.

01:04:23.535 --> 01:04:25.264
Sure, Otis. If you say.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:28.203
I've got my own life to lead, all right?
I don't belong here anymore.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.860
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:57.125
What happened, Otis?
Oh, please don't say, "Nothing."

01:04:58.437 --> 01:05:00.337
Look, it's complicated.

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:04.034
If you're hurting, let me help.
I'd like to help.

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:09.005
You know what happened?
I froze. Okay?

01:05:09.348 --> 01:05:13.808
Last night, I didn't run the coyotes off.
I couldn't do anything.

01:05:14.853 --> 01:05:18.118
They're gonna come back tonight,
and I can't protect anyone.

01:05:18.223 --> 01:05:22.785
Everyone here, they all trust me.
And I can't protect a single one of them.

01:05:24.429 --> 01:05:27.956
Otis, the best leader
isn't the biggest or the strongest.

01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:31.402
The best leader is the one
who cares the most.

01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:35.964
Yeah, that's a nice thought, Daisy.
That's a really nice thought.

01:05:37.242 --> 01:05:41.144
I'll tell you one thing.
I am really going to miss Bessy.

01:05:47.019 --> 01:05:50.284
Okay. If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

01:05:50.923 --> 01:05:53.551
But I just want you to know one thing.

01:05:53.759 --> 01:05:57.525
Even if you do leave, I believe in you.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.843
Otis! Otis!

01:06:18.283 --> 01:06:20.717
All right, Peck, take it easy.
What's the matter?

01:06:21.153 --> 01:06:24.748
They took... We got to... Come on!

01:06:27.726 --> 01:06:29.387
I found him, guys!

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:34.094
Otis, the coyotes. It just happened.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:37.691
They took Etta, Hanna,
maybe six, seven others, I don't know.

01:06:37.803 --> 01:06:40.169
They've never come
during the day before.

01:06:40.272 --> 01:06:42.706
They knew I wouldn't be
expecting them until tonight.

01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.105
They played me.

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.733
- What?
- Nothing.

01:06:46.411 --> 01:06:48.936
Otis, they took Maddie.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:56.020
Those coyotes are strong.

01:06:58.423 --> 01:06:59.583
What?

01:06:59.691 --> 01:07:02.125
The coyotes, they're strong.

01:07:03.195 --> 01:07:06.926
I was just wondering
what a stronger man might do.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:29.948
- You'll look after things?
- Be proud to.

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:32.957
I'll be back.

01:07:48.473 --> 01:07:51.340
- I'm going, too.
- No, Pip, stay here.

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.911
You can't do this alone.
They could kill you.

01:07:54.012 --> 01:07:56.003
Yeah, I guess they could.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:39.889
It's nice that you ladies
could join us this evening.

01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:44.321
Thank you for being so patient.
We prefer dining at night.

01:08:50.535 --> 01:08:52.729
You're a wonderful species.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:57.573
I love chicken.
My favorite part is the skin.

01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.439
You're a big meanie.

01:08:59.544 --> 01:09:01.636
- What?
- You're a meaner.

01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:05.773
Meaner, meaner.
Meaners got to eat, too.

01:09:05.884 --> 01:09:07.475
Leave her alone.

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.684
This one's mine.

01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:12.586
Cook her while I have the little one
for an appetizer.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:15.091
You know, because I'm a meaner.

01:09:20.966 --> 01:09:22.957
Put the chick down, Dag.

01:09:28.473 --> 01:09:30.441
- Otis!
- Oaty!

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:35.375
We suddenly got a burst of courage,
did we?

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:36.947
Okay. All right.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:40.575
Well, first, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take that chick from you.

01:09:40.685 --> 01:09:43.448
Then, while you're picking yourself
up off the ground,

01:09:43.555 --> 01:09:46.921
I'm gonna gather up the hens
and I'm gonna leave.

01:09:47.024 --> 01:09:50.153
And exactly how do you propose
you're going to do that?

01:09:58.303 --> 01:09:59.668
Kill him!

01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:02.968
<i>Well, I know what's right</i>

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:07.136
<i>I got just one life</i>

01:10:08.313 --> 01:10:12.682
<i>In a world that keeps on</i>
<i>pushing me around</i>

01:10:12.784 --> 01:10:15.912
<i>But I'll stand my ground</i>

01:10:16.955 --> 01:10:20.186
<i>And I won't back down</i>

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.558
<i>Hey, baby</i>

01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:28.798
<i>There ain't no easy way out</i>

01:10:30.335 --> 01:10:32.530
<i>Hey</i>

01:10:32.637 --> 01:10:37.301
<i>I will stand my ground</i>

01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:41.701
<i>And I won't back down</i>

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.114
Oh, you like that, yeah?

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.929
That should do. That should do.

01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:03.565
Well, look at the hero.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:07.302
You thought you could come
into my den?

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.300
Now, why don't you lay there and watch

01:11:11.409 --> 01:11:14.037
while we eat your friends?

01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:29.052
What's this?

01:11:30.562 --> 01:11:33.531
A strong man stands up for himself.

01:11:34.966 --> 01:11:38.163
A stronger man stands up for others.

01:11:40.538 --> 01:11:42.301
This should be fun.

01:11:51.616 --> 01:11:53.413
I smell fear.

01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:56.385
Shoot! I told you they can smell it!

01:11:56.488 --> 01:11:58.149
They can smell it?

01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:02.257
Oh, yeah, I have it. I have a lot of it.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.920
Just stick near me, guys,
and you'll be all right.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.624
Yeah, I'll watch your juicy back.

01:12:08.066 --> 01:12:09.624
I mean, your regular back.

01:12:11.836 --> 01:12:13.667
- Hey!
- Sorry, man.

01:12:13.772 --> 01:12:16.206
They're just pellets. I'm nervous.

01:12:17.175 --> 01:12:18.802
That's your army?

01:12:24.416 --> 01:12:28.318
Something tells me you may want
to take a couple steps back.

01:12:34.259 --> 01:12:35.453
Here we come!

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.925
- Here comes trou...
- Ble!

01:12:37.028 --> 01:12:38.290
- Trou...
- Ble!

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:39.863
- Trou...
- Ble!

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:53.441
Pip, talk me into it. Talk me into it.

01:12:53.545 --> 01:12:55.911
Flip the lid a little bit.
You're mad! You're a pig!

01:12:56.014 --> 01:12:58.107
- You're mad!
- Let's do this!

01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:12.624
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go right in your ear!

01:13:14.065 --> 01:13:17.592
There's a mouse in my ear!
There's a mouse in my ear!

01:13:19.037 --> 01:13:21.130
Oh, yeah. Step on it, baby!

01:13:26.911 --> 01:13:30.779
All right, come on.
Give me your best shot.

01:13:30.882 --> 01:13:33.976
Oh, sorry. Here. You know what?
Let me give you a hand.

01:13:34.085 --> 01:13:37.248
Yeah, give him the puncher!
Smack him!

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:07.882
Well, well, whatever will I do?

01:14:13.024 --> 01:14:16.460
Oh, don't worry,
I got something special for you.

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.948
I just love that little guy.

01:14:38.049 --> 01:14:39.482
Come on, hurry.

01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:46.019
- No!
- Hi!

01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:50.993
It tastes like chicken!

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:52.822
Chicken!

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:54.592
Chick, chick, chickity-chick, chicken!

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:57.862
Come here,
you furry, four-legged chickens!

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.401
Take it easy, man.

01:15:03.508 --> 01:15:06.443
Come on, what you got going?
There's nothing there.

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.218
Hey, Otis, look out!

01:15:17.322 --> 01:15:19.313
- Behind you!
- Watch out!

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.985
Watch out!

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.458
Look behind you.

01:15:37.008 --> 01:15:38.407
Remember me?

01:15:38.943 --> 01:15:40.433
I'm Ben's kid.

01:15:53.858 --> 01:15:56.656
Never come back!

01:15:59.664 --> 01:16:02.565
- Pip?
- I'd have to go with the iron, man.

01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:21.785
Then I said
I was gonna hit him with a stick.

01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:24.480
We know. We know.
I heard you say that.

01:16:24.822 --> 01:16:26.255
Quite a night, huh?

01:16:26.357 --> 01:16:28.825
We took down the coyotes,
Peck learned to crow,

01:16:28.927 --> 01:16:30.224
and by the time we get back,

01:16:30.328 --> 01:16:32.523
we'll have a new member
of the barnyard running around.

01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:36.131
Daisy. She like went into labor
after you left.

01:16:37.902 --> 01:16:39.961
- Daisy's...
- She's having her baby, dude.

01:16:40.071 --> 01:16:41.470
What you think was gonna happen?

01:16:41.573 --> 01:16:43.404
She would just keep getting
bigger or something?

01:16:43.508 --> 01:16:46.341
- Is she all right? We've gotta get back.
- Yeah.

01:16:46.444 --> 01:16:48.878
Doubtful we'll make it
back in time walking.

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.278
I'm sure she's gonna be all right, Otis.

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:53.976
Miles, I've got to be there.

01:16:59.557 --> 01:17:01.991
Please remember, mister,
that I am a lady.

01:17:02.093 --> 01:17:05.290
When you are with me,
your eyes are on me, not her.

01:17:09.634 --> 01:17:12.296
We can call and tell them
where to pick them up.

01:17:33.257 --> 01:17:34.315
Car!

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:40.221
Righteous!

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.542
Duke, what's happening?

01:17:57.649 --> 01:18:01.847
Otis, come on. You know, I think...
I'm pretty sure... Yeah, it's time.

01:18:09.861 --> 01:18:10.919
Boy.

01:18:37.822 --> 01:18:41.019
Otis, I was so worried.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:44.185
Worried about what?
I so had that covered.

01:18:45.063 --> 01:18:46.826
It's okay, I'm here.

01:18:49.534 --> 01:18:52.298
And I'm here for you, too.

01:18:54.372 --> 01:18:57.899
Okay, girl, you're doing fine.
Now, just breathe.

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.474
Man, that looks like it hurts.

01:19:31.576 --> 01:19:34.204
Oh, that's very profound, Insight-Man.

01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:36.405
Well, excuse me for being a pig.

01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:38.505
How come nothing's happened yet?

01:19:38.616 --> 01:19:40.880
She's gonna be all right, though, huh?

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:44.148
Yeah, like, like...
What if it gets stuck or something?

01:19:44.255 --> 01:19:48.521
What? You mean like stuck halfway,
so she'd be a cow and a half?

01:19:48.626 --> 01:19:50.526
I didn't say "cow and a half."

01:19:50.628 --> 01:19:52.186
Yes, you did. You just did.

01:19:52.296 --> 01:19:56.323
- Hey, Duke, did I say "Cow and a half"?
- I'm not doing this.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:58.066
No, look.

01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:06.302
It's a beautiful little boy.

01:20:09.747 --> 01:20:11.009
Go ahead.

01:20:18.589 --> 01:20:20.056
He's perfect.

01:20:21.392 --> 01:20:23.690
What are you gonna name him?

01:20:24.262 --> 01:20:26.856
I was thinking I kind of like

01:20:28.633 --> 01:20:29.725
Ben.

01:20:35.907 --> 01:20:37.875
Oh, I think that's just great.

01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:40.910
Hey, there, little Ben.

01:20:43.614 --> 01:20:46.913
Hey, there, little buddy. Look at you.

01:20:48.119 --> 01:20:50.087
Look at my little buddy.

01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:52.554
Here you go.

01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:06.360
Hey, Otis, we were all talking,

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:09.098
and we know you may have
other plans, we understand that,

01:21:09.207 --> 01:21:12.233
but we really, really appreciate
what you did around here.

01:21:12.343 --> 01:21:14.470
And, well, we were wondering,
I don't know,

01:21:14.579 --> 01:21:17.241
if maybe you planned
on staying around a little longer?

01:21:17.348 --> 01:21:19.839
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

01:21:19.984 --> 01:21:21.747
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.616
<i>To take another's hand</i>

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:28.786
I'll just say this,

01:21:28.893 --> 01:21:30.724
as long as I'm still kicking,

01:21:30.828 --> 01:21:34.992
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

01:21:42.006 --> 01:21:43.268
High paw!

01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.133
Hey, all right.

01:21:51.415 --> 01:21:53.906
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

01:21:54.418 --> 01:21:56.909
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

01:21:57.054 --> 01:21:59.614
<i>For people who are strong</i>

01:22:00.024 --> 01:22:02.356
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.520
<i>Freedom is a land</i>

01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:08.524
<i>Freedom is the courage</i>

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.965
<i>To take another's hand</i>

01:22:33.422 --> 01:22:36.823
I, Nora Beady, am a precious object

01:22:36.925 --> 01:22:39.519
and shall treat myself as such.

01:22:42.564 --> 01:22:46.261
Gosh, I wonder why...
I forgot to use conditioner or...

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:53.970
