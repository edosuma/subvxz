WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:34.266 --> 00:35.166
IT'S GOT WHITE WALLS,

00:35.233 --> 00:36.233
A GLASS TABLE, AND A BIG DORK

00:36.300 --> 00:36.900
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

00:36.966 --> 00:38.300
THIS IS BASICALLY AN APPLE STORE

00:38.366 --> 00:40.033

NOW WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK,

01:01.666 --> 01:03.733
RUDY GIULIANI DO IT INSTEAD.

A SENTIENT LL BEAN PREMIUM

02:24.900 --> 02:26.066
DOUBLE L TRADITIONAL FIT POLO.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.633

02:27.700 --> 02:28.933
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING

02:29.000 --> 02:31.233
SEX-TRAFFICKING LAWS INVOLVING

02:31.300 --> 02:32.766
A MINOR -- SOMETHING HE DENIES,

02:32.833 --> 02:34.500
CLAIMING THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:34.566 --> 02:35.833
A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR EXTORTION

02:35.900 --> 02:40.166
PLOT BEHIND THE INVESTIGATION.

02:40.233 --> 02:41.233
HE EVEN WENT ON TUCKER CARLSON'S

02:41.300 --> 02:42.400
SHOW TO EXPLAIN HIS THEORY,

02:42.466 --> 02:43.800
UNSUCCESSFULLY.

02:43.866 --> 02:46.133
>> YOU SAY THAT IT WAS -- THAT

02:46.200 --> 02:46.800
IT WAS OR IS UNDERWAY, THERE WAS

02:46.866 --> 02:48.100
AN INVESTIGATION.

02:48.166 --> 02:48.700
WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THAT

02:48.766 --> 02:50.166
INVESTIGATION?

02:50.233 --> 02:51.533
WHAT IS THE ALLEGATION?

02:51.600 --> 02:52.766
THAT'S REALLY NOT VERY CLEAR

02:52.833 --> 02:54.666
FROM THESE NEWS STORIES.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.466
>> YEAH.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.533
AGAIN, I ONLY KNOW WHAT I'VE

02:57.600 --> 02:59.533
READ IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

02:59.600 --> 03:01.200
I CAN SAY THAT ACTUALLY

03:01.266 --> 03:02.200
YOU AND I WENT TO DINNER

03:02.266 --> 03:02.900
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO,

03:02.966 --> 03:04.033
YOUR WIFE WAS THERE,

03:04.100 --> 03:05.266
AND I BROUGHT A FRIEND OF MINE.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.700
YOU'LL REMEMBER HER.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.300
AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY THREATENED

03:09.366 --> 03:11.866
BY THE FBI, TOLD THAT IF SHE

03:11.933 --> 03:13.666
WOULDN'T COP TO THE FACT THAT

03:13.733 --> 03:15.366
SOMEHOW I WAS INVOLVED IN SOME

03:15.433 --> 03:16.333
PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME, THAT SHE

03:16.400 --> 03:17.700
COULD FACE TROUBLE.

03:17.766 --> 03:18.866
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THE WOMAN

03:18.933 --> 03:19.900
YOU'RE SPEAKING OF OR

03:19.966 --> 03:21.100
THE CONTEXT AT ALL, HONESTLY.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.100
>> John: WOW.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.900
IMAGINE BEING THE ONE WHITE MAN

03:24.966 --> 03:25.866
ON EARTH THAT TUCKER CARLSON

03:25.933 --> 03:29.733
WON'T DEFEND.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.833
TUCKER WAS SO CLEARLY TRYING TO

03:30.900 --> 03:31.733
NOPE HIS WAY OUT OF THAT

03:31.800 --> 03:32.433
WHOLE INTERVIEW.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.866
HE LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO WALK

03:36.933 --> 03:37.900
OUT OF HIS OWN SHOW.

03:37.966 --> 03:38.666
THE PROBLEM IS, IF HE DID,

03:38.733 --> 03:39.400
IT WOULDN'T BE

03:39.466 --> 03:40.466
"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT"

03:40.533 --> 03:41.500
ANYMORE, IT'D BE "THE MATT GAETZ

03:41.566 --> 03:42.200
DIGS HIS OWN GRAVE ADVENTURE

03:42.266 --> 03:43.300
HOUR."

03:43.366 --> 03:44.033
LOOK, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE MORE

03:44.100 --> 03:44.733
TO DISCUSS ABOUT THIS STORY

03:44.800 --> 03:45.966
LATER, PROBABLY DURING

03:46.033 --> 03:48.200
MATT GAETZ'S SENTENCING PHASE,

03:48.266 --> 03:50.000
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ONTO

03:50.066 --> 03:51.466
AMAZON, A COMPANY RUN BY

03:51.533 --> 03:53.100
JEFF BEZOS, WHO ANSWERS

03:53.166 --> 03:53.766
THE QUESTION "WHAT IF LEX LUTHOR

03:53.833 --> 03:54.866
WAS?"

03:54.933 --> 03:56.166
AND THAT'S IT.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.133
JUST "WHAT IF LEX LUTHOR WAS?"

03:58.200 --> 03:59.200
HE'S A BALD BUSINESS MANIAC WITH

03:59.266 --> 04:00.800
TOO MUCH MONEY, ZERO EMPATHY,

04:00.866 --> 04:02.400
AND WEIRD SUPERVILLAIN VEHICLES.

04:02.466 --> 04:04.366
HE'S JUST LEX LUTHOR.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.333
THIS WEEK, COUNTING BEGAN ON

04:06.400 --> 04:07.900
A HISTORIC UNION VOTE BY WORKERS

04:07.966 --> 04:09.033
AT AN AMAZON FULFILLMENT CENTER

04:09.100 --> 04:10.566
IN BESSEMER, ALABAMA.

04:10.633 --> 04:12.066
THE DRIVE HAS BEEN SEEN

04:12.133 --> 04:13.633
AS A BELLWETHER FOR THE LABOR

04:13.700 --> 04:14.733
MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE, AND AMAZON

04:14.800 --> 04:16.366
WORKERS FRANKLY HAVE PLENTY OF

04:16.433 --> 04:18.400
REASONS TO FIGHT TO UNIONIZE.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.300
>> MANY COMPLAIN ABOUT GRUELING

04:20.366 --> 04:21.666
WORK, UNSAFE CONDITIONS, WITH

04:21.733 --> 04:22.400
INADEQUATE BATHROOM AND MEAL

04:22.466 --> 04:24.766
BREAKS.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.200
>> THEY TREAT YOU MORE LIKE A

04:26.266 --> 04:27.166
PRODUCT OR A STATISTIC THAN AN

04:27.233 --> 04:28.866
ACTUAL HUMAN BEING.

04:28.933 --> 04:30.566
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M A DIABETIC AND

04:30.633 --> 04:31.666
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STOP TO

04:31.733 --> 04:34.266
CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.400
THEY HAVE JUST CONSTANT QUOTAS,

04:36.466 --> 04:38.166
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET DONE WHAT

04:38.233 --> 04:40.633
THEY WANT YOU TO GET DONE,

04:40.700 --> 04:41.266
THEN YOU HAVE NO WORTH INSIDE OF

04:41.333 --> 04:43.133
THEIR SYSTEM.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.366
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.966
AND THE FACT AMAZON WORKERS ARE

04:47.033 --> 04:49.866
DEMORALIZED IS SOMETHING YOU

04:49.933 --> 04:50.466
KNEW, BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY

04:50.533 --> 04:51.333
LESS UPSETTING NO MATTER HOW

04:51.400 --> 04:52.566
MANY TIMES YOU'RE REMINDED.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.033
IT'S LIKE HEARING THAT

04:54.100 --> 04:55.266
DENNIS QUAID'S NEW WIFE IS

04:55.333 --> 04:57.000
YOUNGER THAN HIS SON, OR THAT

04:57.066 --> 04:58.600
HELENA BONHAM CARTER HAS NEVER

04:58.666 --> 05:00.566
WON AN OSCAR, OR THAT NO ONE HAS

05:00.633 --> 05:02.233
EVER CLEANED A SINGLE WATERPARK.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.300
SERIOUSLY, WHEN HAS A WATERPARK

05:03.366 --> 05:05.533
EVER FELT CLEAN TO YOU?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.866
OPEN-TO-CLOSE, IT'S FULL OF

05:06.933 --> 05:08.433
FILTHY KIDS PISSING THEMSELVES

05:08.500 --> 05:09.900
DOWN SCALDING PLASTIC SLIDES

05:09.966 --> 05:11.733
INTO RECYCLED WATER AND

05:11.800 --> 05:13.066
NIGHT TIME IS WHEN THE EMPLOYEES

05:13.133 --> 05:14.166
FUCK IN THE TUBES.

05:14.233 --> 05:17.033
HOW WOULD CLEANING IT EVEN WORK?

05:17.100 --> 05:18.033
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO,

05:18.100 --> 05:18.733
DRAIN THE LAZY RIVER

05:18.800 --> 05:19.466
EVERY NIGHT?

05:19.533 --> 05:20.133
OF COURSE NOT.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
YOU'RE SWIMMING IN THE PISS OF

05:21.266 --> 05:22.066
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, MANY OF

05:22.133 --> 05:22.666
WHOM HAVE LONG SINCE DIED.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.166
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

05:25.233 --> 05:28.000
AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW

05:28.066 --> 05:30.666
THE RESULTS OF THIS VOTE YET,

05:30.733 --> 05:31.833
IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT JUST

05:31.900 --> 05:34.700
HOW HARD AMAZON HAS FOUGHT IT.

05:34.766 --> 05:36.533
THEY'VE APPARENTLY BEEN SENDING

05:36.600 --> 05:38.166
WORKERS UP TO FIVE TEXT MESSAGES

05:38.233 --> 05:39.766
PER DAY DISCOURAGING THEM FROM

05:39.833 --> 05:41.300
JOINING A UNION; THEY'VE ALSO

05:41.366 --> 05:42.366
HELD MANDATORY MEETINGS THAT

05:42.433 --> 05:43.633
DISPARAGE UNIONIZATION,

05:43.700 --> 05:44.433
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:

05:44.500 --> 05:45.666
>> SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER, EVER

05:45.733 --> 05:46.666
SEEN BEFORE IN WRITING ABOUT

05:46.733 --> 05:48.200
LABOR FOR 25, 30 YEARS,

05:48.266 --> 05:49.566
THEY HAVE ANTI-UNION POSTERS

05:49.633 --> 05:50.800
IN THE BATHROOM STALLS.

05:50.866 --> 05:52.266
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO THE

05:52.333 --> 05:52.866
BATHROOM, WHO WANT TO LOOK AT

05:52.933 --> 05:57.133
THAT?

05:57.200 --> 05:58.166
>> John: YEHA, NOBODY!

05:58.233 --> 05:58.733
NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK AT THAT

05:58.800 --> 05:59.700
POSTER IN THE BATHROOM.

05:59.766 --> 06:00.900
THE ONLY THING WORSE TO SEE

06:00.966 --> 06:01.733
WHILE YOU'RE TAKING A DUMP

06:01.800 --> 06:02.666
IN A WORKPLACE BATHROOM STALL IS

06:02.733 --> 06:04.500
AN EMPTY TOILET PAPER ROLL,

06:04.566 --> 06:06.066
OR KEVIN SPACEY.

06:06.133 --> 06:06.966
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

06:07.033 --> 06:11.566
GET OUT!

06:11.633 --> 06:13.700
I'M SHITTING, KEVIN!

06:13.766 --> 06:14.566
AND SPEAKING OF BATHROOM BREAKS,

06:14.633 --> 06:16.033
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT HOW,

06:16.100 --> 06:17.300
WORKERS HAVE SAID THEY'VE HAD TO

06:17.366 --> 06:18.033
FOREGO THEM TO KEEP UP WITH

06:18.100 --> 06:18.766
CRUSHING QUOTAS.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.400
AND SOME DELIVERY DRIVERS HAVE

06:20.466 --> 06:21.400
REPORTEDLY RESORTED TO URINATING

06:21.466 --> 06:25.400
IN BOTTLES.

06:25.466 --> 06:27.133
AND JUST THIS WEEK, "THE

06:27.200 --> 06:27.966

06:34.866 --> 06:36.066
SOMETHING ALMOST TOO AWFUL TO

06:36.133 --> 06:38.000
COMPREHEND, AS TWO OF NEW YORK'S

06:38.066 --> 06:38.900
MORNING NEWS ANCHORS CONVEYED IN

06:38.966 --> 06:40.733

06:42.000 --> 06:42.366

06:42.433 --> 06:43.733
COME ON!

06:43.800 --> 06:45.566
IT'S MORNING TIME.

06:45.633 --> 06:46.766
PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR COFFEE

06:46.833 --> 06:49.833

06:49.900 --> 06:51.133
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS,

06:51.200 --> 06:52.133
LAURIE, I'M NOT SO INTERESTED IN

06:52.200 --> 06:53.366
KNOWING ALL THE DETAILS.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.166
>> WHAT, BECAUSE THEN THEY COME

06:54.233 --> 06:54.900
AND DELIVER YOUR PACKAGE?

06:54.966 --> 06:55.566
>> YEAH.

06:55.633 --> 06:56.433
>> John: YEAH, IT'S A REVOLTING

06:56.500 --> 06:58.100
STORY.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.600
NOBODY WANTS TO ENDURE A BAG OF

06:59.666 --> 07:01.000
SHIT OVER BREAKFAST.

07:01.066 --> 07:02.033
THAT'S WHY PIERS MORGAN

07:02.100 --> 07:04.166
NO LONGER HAS A JOB.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.300
AND LOOK, I GET NOT WANTING TO

07:05.366 --> 07:06.733
KNOW DETAILS ABOUT THINGS.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.533
AS A GENERAL RULE,

07:08.600 --> 07:09.733
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW MOST

07:09.800 --> 07:10.433
THINGS GET DONE.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.900
BUT I DO MAKE AN EXCEPTION

07:11.966 --> 07:13.433
IF ONE OF THE STEPS INVOLVES

07:13.500 --> 07:14.866
SOMEONE HAVING TO SHIT IN A BAG.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.633
THAT GOES FOR ANY PROCESS.

07:16.700 --> 07:17.600
I'M NOT REALLY ALL THAT

07:17.666 --> 07:19.200
INTERESTED IN HOW

07:19.266 --> 07:20.733
AN ORIGAMI CRANE GETS MADE,

07:20.800 --> 07:22.266
BUT IF YOU TOLD ME ONE OF THE

07:22.333 --> 07:23.433
STEPS INVOLVED YOU HAVING TO

07:23.500 --> 07:25.033
SHIT IN A BAG, I'M GOING TO NEED

07:25.100 --> 07:25.700
A DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP LOOK

07:25.766 --> 07:26.766
INTO THE PROCEDURE.

07:26.833 --> 07:27.766
BECAUSE SOMETHING HORRENDOUS

07:27.833 --> 07:30.100
IS CLEARLY HAPPENING THERE.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.200
AND THE FACT IS, WE DO HAVE TO

07:31.266 --> 07:33.733
KEEP PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.700
BECAUSE THE OUTCOME OF

07:34.766 --> 07:36.000
BESSEMER'S VOTE WILL HAVE

07:36.066 --> 07:37.800
MAJOR IMPLICATIONS.

07:37.866 --> 07:38.800
AMAZON IS THE SECOND LARGEST

07:38.866 --> 07:41.300
PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN AMERICA.

07:41.366 --> 07:42.733
AND THIS UNIONIZING EFFORT

07:42.800 --> 07:44.233
COULD DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR

07:44.300 --> 07:45.133
EMPLOYEES HAVE THE POWER TO

07:45.200 --> 07:46.000
DEMAND DECENT WORKING

07:46.066 --> 07:47.500
CONDITIONS.

07:47.566 --> 07:49.533
AND THE HARDER THE COMPANY TRIES

07:49.600 --> 07:50.800
TO CONVINCE THEIR WORKERS THAT

07:50.866 --> 07:52.166
THEY DON'T NEED UNION

07:52.233 --> 07:53.633
PROTECTION, THE CLEARER IT

BECOMES THAT AMAZON EXECUTIVES

09:45.500 --> 09:46.366
THE NATIONAL DEBT -- THE WORLD'S

09:46.433 --> 09:48.900
MOST BORING $28 TRILLION.

09:48.966 --> 09:49.866
AND I KNOW, JUST SAYING

09:49.933 --> 09:50.400
"$28 TRILLION" MIGHT SOUND

09:50.466 --> 09:51.400
CONFUSING.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.133
HOW MUCH IS THAT, EXACTLY?

09:53.200 --> 09:54.500
WELL, TO PUT IT ONE WAY:

09:54.566 --> 09:55.633
IT'S $28 TRILLION.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.266
TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,

09:57.333 --> 09:58.500
IT'S 28 MILLION MILLIONS.

09:58.566 --> 09:59.400
TO PUT IT A THIRD WAY, IT'S

09:59.466 --> 10:01.500
AN ABSOLUTE FUCK-TON OF MONEY.

10:01.566 --> 10:05.233
BUT REGARDLESS, THE NATIONAL

10:05.300 --> 10:06.200
DEBT IS A COMPLETE OBSESSION

10:06.266 --> 10:07.000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.166
HERE IN NEW YORK, WE EVEN HAVE

10:08.233 --> 10:08.800
A DEBT CLOCK THAT COUNTS UP

10:08.866 --> 10:09.866
IN REAL TIME.

10:09.933 --> 10:11.066
IT ACTUALLY MADE HEADLINES

10:11.133 --> 10:12.733
A LITTLE OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN

10:12.800 --> 10:14.233
THE DEBT HIT FOURTEEN DIGITS.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.866
>> THE NATIONAL DEBT JUST PASSED

10:16.933 --> 10:17.833
$10 TRILLION, SO THE CLOCK'S

10:17.900 --> 10:19.500
CARETAKERS HAD TO SQUEEZE A ONE

10:19.566 --> 10:20.466
AND THE DOLLAR SIGN INTO THE

10:20.533 --> 10:21.833
SAME SQUARE.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.800
>> IT'S PRETTY SCARY.

10:23.866 --> 10:25.533
IT'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.300
>> INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

10:26.366 --> 10:28.433
IT'S TOO BIG.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.900
>> THE CLOCK WAS PUT UP IN 1989

10:30.966 --> 10:32.233
BY HELENA DURST'S GRANDFATHER

10:32.300 --> 10:33.366
WHEN THE NATIONAL DEBT WAS JUST

10:33.433 --> 10:35.166
UNDER $3 TRILLION.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.700
NOW THAT THE DEBT HAS PASSED

10:36.766 --> 10:38.333
THE $10 TRILLION MARK, DURST

10:38.400 --> 10:38.933

10:39.000 --> 10:39.833
GRANDFATHER.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.500
>> BORROW, BORROW, BORROW.

10:42.566 --> 10:43.433
ENJOY TODAY AND TOMORROW,

10:43.500 --> 10:44.533
FOR TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE

10:44.600 --> 10:46.200
TERRIBLE.

10:46.266 --> 10:47.433
>> John: I'M SORRY, BUT THAT

10:47.500 --> 10:48.700
POEM SUCKS.

10:48.766 --> 10:49.933
THE RHYME SCHEME'S ALL OVER

10:50.000 --> 10:51.600
THE PLACE, AND IF TOMORROW'S

10:51.666 --> 10:52.466
GOING TO BE TERRIBLE, WHY WOULD

10:52.533 --> 10:53.366
YOU ENJOY IT?

10:53.433 --> 10:54.466
THAT WAS CLEARLY THE WORK OF

10:54.533 --> 10:56.133
A MAN ALMOST AS GOOD AT WRITING

10:56.200 --> 10:57.166
POETRY AS HE WAS AT RAISING

10:57.233 --> 10:58.033
CHILDREN WHO AREN'T

10:58.100 --> 11:00.000
SERIAL KILLERS.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.533
OH, YEAH -- THE CLOCK WAS PUT UP

11:01.600 --> 11:03.433
BY THAT DURST FAMILY.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.966
THE BATHROOM MURDER BURP DURSTS.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.033
SO THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

11:07.100 --> 11:09.000
THE DUMB CLOCK THAT DOESN'T

11:09.066 --> 11:09.766
TELL TIME, YOU WEALTHY

11:09.833 --> 11:11.133
BATHROOM MURDER BURPERS.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.700
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

11:12.766 --> 11:15.133
OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS UNDENIABLY

11:15.200 --> 11:16.966
BIG, AND BETWEEN THE TRILLIONS

11:17.033 --> 11:18.200
IN CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILLS

11:18.266 --> 11:19.133
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS

11:19.200 --> 11:20.800
BIDEN UNVEILED JUST THIS WEEK,

11:20.866 --> 11:22.366
IT'S POISED TO GET EVEN BIGGER.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.366
AND REPUBLICANS, IN PARTICULAR,

11:23.433 --> 11:26.766
SEEM OUTRAGED ABOUT THAT.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.133
>> THIS CHART SHOWING DEBT IS

11:29.200 --> 11:30.666
NOT JUST ABOUT THE BIG NUMBER.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.333
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

11:32.400 --> 11:34.366
THE $30 TRILLION OF DEBT.

11:34.433 --> 11:37.600
THIS IS ABOUT TYRANNY.

11:37.666 --> 11:38.333
>> HISTORY IS SCREAMING THIS

11:38.400 --> 11:39.333
WARNING AT US.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.266
COUNTRIES THAT BANKRUPT

11:40.333 --> 11:41.966
THEMSELVES AND DESTROY THEIR

11:42.033 --> 11:43.666
ECONOMIES SIMPLY AREN'T AROUND

11:43.733 --> 11:45.100
VERY LONG.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.666

11:46.733 --> 11:48.600
RECKONING, A DEBT CRISIS.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
AND IT WON'T BE PRETTY.

11:50.066 --> 11:52.233
>> DEFICITS DO MATTER.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.566
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOUR

11:54.633 --> 11:55.833
FAMILY WOULD LAST IF EVERY

11:55.900 --> 11:57.333
MONTH, YOU SPENT MORE AND MORE

11:57.400 --> 11:57.966
ON THE CREDIT CARD AND MADE THE

11:58.033 --> 11:59.066
MINIMUM PAYMENT?

11:59.133 --> 12:02.100
NOT LONG.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.433
>> John: LOOK, I KNOW THAT ALL

12:05.500 --> 12:06.066
SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY, BUT FOR

12:06.133 --> 12:07.100
WHAT IT'S WORTH,

12:07.166 --> 12:08.133
THE NATIONAL DEBT IS NOTHING

12:08.200 --> 12:08.966
LIKE A CREDIT CARD.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.466
FOR A START, WE DON'T HAVE

12:10.533 --> 12:11.566
28 TRILLION AIRLINE MILES,

12:11.633 --> 12:12.566
NOR DO WE GET LETTERS

12:12.633 --> 12:13.566
IN THE MAIL EVERY DAY SAYING

12:13.633 --> 12:14.166
WE'RE PREAPPROVED FOR

12:14.233 --> 12:17.200
A BRAND NEW NATIONAL DEBT.

12:17.266 --> 12:17.800
LEAVE US ALONE, YOU FUCKING

12:17.866 --> 12:18.833
PARASITES!

12:18.900 --> 12:19.966
BUT IF WE HAVE HUGE CLOCKS TO

12:20.033 --> 12:21.166
MEASURE IT, WE'RE CONSIDERING

12:21.233 --> 12:22.700
AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT

12:22.766 --> 12:23.866
COULD ADD TWO TRILLION TO IT,

12:23.933 --> 12:25.433
AND SOME ARE IMPLYING THAT OUR

12:25.500 --> 12:26.300
CREDITORS COULD BE TURNING UP

12:26.366 --> 12:27.900
ANY DAY NOW WITH A BASEBALL BAT

12:27.966 --> 12:29.533
TO REPOSSESS OUR BRIDGES AND

12:29.600 --> 12:30.766
DAMS BECAUSE OF IT, WE THOUGHT

12:30.833 --> 12:32.200
TONIGHT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO

12:32.266 --> 12:33.566
TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT:

12:33.633 --> 12:35.400
HOW IT WORKS, HOW VALID CONCERNS

12:35.466 --> 12:37.466
ABOUT IT ARE, AND HOW WE SHOULD

12:37.533 --> 12:38.833
THINK ABOUT IT MOVING FORWARD.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.600
AND LET'S START WITH THE BASICS,

12:40.666 --> 12:41.833
LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

12:41.900 --> 12:43.366
THE DEBT AND A DEFICIT.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.000
A COUNTRY RUNS A DEFICIT WHEN

12:45.066 --> 12:46.333
IT SPENDS MORE MONEY ON THINGS

12:46.400 --> 12:46.833
LIKE THE MILITARY,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.233
SOCIAL PROGRAMS,

12:48.300 --> 12:49.600
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE

12:49.666 --> 12:50.500
GOVERNMENT DOES -- THAN IT

12:50.566 --> 12:51.533
BRINGS IN -- MOSTLY THROUGH

12:51.600 --> 12:52.833
TAXES.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.066
NOW, TO PAY FOR A DEFICIT,

12:54.133 --> 12:55.600
THE GOVERNMENT THEN BORROWS

12:55.666 --> 12:57.700
MONEY, THUS ACCRUING DEBT.

12:57.766 --> 12:59.400
SO THE DEFICIT IS A YEARLY

12:59.466 --> 13:00.400
MEASUREMENT OF HOW MUCH WE'RE

13:00.466 --> 13:01.433
IN THE RED.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
AND THE DEBT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT

13:03.566 --> 13:04.400
THAT WE OWE, ACCUMULATED OVER

13:04.466 --> 13:05.900
TIME.

13:05.966 --> 13:07.333
AND FOR DECADES, IN POLITICAL

13:07.400 --> 13:09.033
ADS, THE DEBT HAS BEEN PORTRAYED

13:09.100 --> 13:10.500
AS A BURDEN WE'RE PLACING ON

13:10.566 --> 13:11.700
FUTURE GENERATIONS.

13:11.766 --> 13:13.466
BASICALLY, MAKING THAT ARGUMENT

13:13.533 --> 13:15.000
THAT WE'RE RUNNING UP THEIR

13:15.066 --> 13:16.700
CREDIT CARD, AND ONE DAY,

13:16.766 --> 13:17.833
THE BILL'S GOING TO COME DUE.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.700
>> YOU OWE THE UNITED STATES

13:19.766 --> 13:22.233
GOVERNMENT, IN ROUND NUMBERS,

13:22.300 --> 13:24.833
$50,000.

13:24.900 --> 13:25.933
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
CHRISTMAS?

13:28.066 --> 13:29.366
>> I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIX THE

13:29.433 --> 13:31.266
DEBT, SO I CAN HAVE A FUTURE.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.533
>> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO

13:34.600 --> 13:38.000
AMERICA'S DEBT, AND THE CHINESE

13:38.066 --> 13:40.733
GOVERNMENT THAT LENDS US MONEY.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.333
>> CONGRESS MUST STOP DIGGING

13:41.400 --> 13:42.166
A DEEP HOLE OF DEBT THAT WE'LL

13:42.233 --> 13:43.433
NEVER GET OUT OF.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.966
>> PLEASE STOP DIGGING.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.100
>> John: YEAH, PRETTY DRAMATIC.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.733
CRYING BABIES, EXASPERATED

13:49.800 --> 13:50.433
SANTAS, AND EVEN A CHILD

13:50.500 --> 13:51.700
WATCHING UNCLE SAM

13:51.766 --> 13:53.800
DIGGING A GRAVE.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.733
AND QUICK PIECE OF ADVICE, KIDS.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.166
IF YOU DO SEE A MAN IN ANY KIND

13:57.233 --> 13:58.133
OF COSTUME DIGGING A LARGE HOLE

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT,

13:59.266 --> 14:00.600
DO NOT APPROACH HIM.

14:00.666 --> 14:02.033
DO NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS

14:02.100 --> 14:03.300
DIGGING.

14:03.366 --> 14:04.266
I'M NOT SAYING HE SHOULD BE

14:04.333 --> 14:05.100
DOING THAT.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.433
I'M SAYING YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

14:06.500 --> 14:07.866
WHO SHOULD TRY TO STOP HIM.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.000
IF HE'S WILLING TO DIG

14:09.066 --> 14:10.366
A BIG HOLE, HE'S WILLING TO DIG

14:10.433 --> 14:10.900
A SMALL ONE.

14:10.966 --> 14:12.400
RUN AWAY AND TELL AN ADULT.

14:12.466 --> 14:15.333
A NON-COSTUMED ADULT.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.666
BUT ADS LIKE THOSE ARE WILDLY

14:16.733 --> 14:18.233
MISLEADING.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.833
FOR INSTANCE, THAT PLEDGE OF

14:19.900 --> 14:20.866
ALLEGIANCE AD TALKED ABOUT HOW

14:20.933 --> 14:21.966
MUCH WE OWE THE CHINESE

14:22.033 --> 14:25.266
GOVERNMENT.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.033
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HEAR A

14:26.100 --> 14:26.833
LOT.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.633
BUT FOR THE RECORD, THE MAJORITY

14:28.700 --> 14:29.600
OF GOVERNMENT DEBT IS ACTUALLY

14:29.666 --> 14:30.766
OWNED BY AMERICAN INVESTORS.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.266
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A

14:33.333 --> 14:34.500
PENSION, YOU MIGHT OWN SOME OF

14:34.566 --> 14:35.700
THAT DEBT IN THE FORM OF

14:35.766 --> 14:36.966
GOVERNMENT BONDS, BECAUSE

14:37.033 --> 14:38.000
THEY'RE A PRETTY SAFE

14:38.066 --> 14:39.066
INVESTMENT.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.933
FOREIGN INVESTORS ONLY OWN

14:41.000 --> 14:43.200
AROUND A THIRD OF OUR DEBT.

14:43.266 --> 14:44.500
AND WHILE, YES, IT'S TRUE, CHINA

14:44.566 --> 14:45.866
DOES OWN OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS

14:45.933 --> 14:52.300
OF IT, WHICH ISN'T NOTHING --

14:52.366 --> 14:53.066
IT'S AROUND 5% --

14:53.133 --> 14:54.066
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

14:54.133 --> 14:55.166
THEY'RE NOT EVEN OUR LARGEST

14:55.233 --> 14:56.166
FOREIGN CREDITOR -- JAPAN IS.

14:56.233 --> 14:57.466
AND WHILE THE DEBT IS OFTEN

14:57.533 --> 14:58.500
TALKED ABOUT AS BEING SOMETHING

14:58.566 --> 14:59.500
WE'RE RUNNING UP WITH NEW

14:59.566 --> 15:00.766
SPENDING, THE TRUTH IS, BEFORE

15:00.833 --> 15:02.066
THE PANDEMIC HIT, MOST OF OUR

15:02.133 --> 15:02.633
DEBT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG,

15:02.700 --> 15:05.266
STEADY GROWTH IN PROGRAMS

15:05.333 --> 15:06.300
THAT WE'D LONG AGO COMMITTED TO,

15:06.366 --> 15:07.200
LIKE MEDICARE AND OTHER

15:07.266 --> 15:08.600
ENTITLEMENTS.

15:08.666 --> 15:09.900
SO WE'RE VERY MUCH GETTING STUFF

15:09.966 --> 15:12.966
FOR THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.100
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

15:14.166 --> 15:16.366
A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE:

15:16.433 --> 15:17.900
GOING INTO DEBT CAN ACTUALLY BE

15:17.966 --> 15:18.766
A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR THE

15:18.833 --> 15:20.066
COUNTRY.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.366
ESSENTIALLY, AS ECONOMISTS WILL

15:21.433 --> 15:22.733
TELL YOU, THE KEY QUESTION IS,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.233
"ARE YOU SPENDING MONEY ON THE

15:24.300 --> 15:26.333
RIGHT THINGS?"

15:26.400 --> 15:27.900
>> WE NEED TO THINK OF THE DEBT.

15:27.966 --> 15:29.200
ARE YOU CREATING MONEY FOR REAL

15:29.266 --> 15:31.166
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?

15:31.233 --> 15:32.800
IF YOU'RE DOING THAT JUST TO

15:32.866 --> 15:33.666
GIVE SOMEBODY MONEY, THEN, YEAH,

15:33.733 --> 15:36.900
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

15:36.966 --> 15:39.633
BUT IF I'M A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL

15:39.700 --> 15:41.300
AND I GO TO THE BANK AND SAY,

15:41.366 --> 15:42.300
"I GOT THIS WONDERFUL NEW IDEA.

15:42.366 --> 15:43.066
I JUST NEED THE MONEY TO BUILD

15:43.133 --> 15:44.800
MY FACTORY."

15:44.866 --> 15:45.900
NOBODY SAYS, "OH, THAT'S

15:45.966 --> 15:46.633
HORRIBLE."

15:46.700 --> 15:47.700
YOU JUST INCREASED THE MONEY

15:47.766 --> 15:49.200
SUPPLY.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.433
BECAUSE WE ALL GO, YEAH, BUT

15:50.500 --> 15:50.933
THERE'S A FACTORY THERE.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
IT'S A REAL THING.

15:52.066 --> 15:53.600
>> John: RIGHT.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.000
TAKING ON DEBT TO BUILD A

15:55.066 --> 15:57.000
FACTORY THAT CREATES JOBS AND

15:57.066 --> 15:58.300
INCREASES ECONOMIC OUTPUT

15:58.366 --> 15:59.900
IS PROBABLY A SMART INVESTMENT.

15:59.966 --> 16:00.966
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ONE THAT

16:01.033 --> 16:02.300
MAKES THIS ACTUAL PILLOWCASE

16:02.366 --> 16:03.966
DEPICTING A NUDE NICOLAS CAGE

16:04.033 --> 16:05.066
LOUNGING IN A BANANA PEEL WITH

16:05.133 --> 16:05.966
TWO GIANT FOXES IN THE

16:06.033 --> 16:07.000
BACKGROUND.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.033
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS THING!

16:09.100 --> 16:10.933
AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS, IT HAS

16:11.000 --> 16:12.800
AN "OPHISTICATED SEAM" WITH

16:12.866 --> 16:14.200
"STYLISH STYLE," AND I'M MORE

16:14.266 --> 16:15.933
THAN HAPPY TO COSIGN ON BOTH OF

16:16.000 --> 16:18.400
THOSE CLAIMS.

16:18.466 --> 16:19.666
AND THE REASON IS, YOU CAN

16:19.733 --> 16:20.966
CONSIDER ME A SATISFIED

16:21.033 --> 16:22.000
CUSTOMER.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.266
I FEEL SO MUCH MORE

16:23.333 --> 16:26.233
OPHISTICATED!

16:26.300 --> 16:28.833
THE POINT IS, REPUBLICANS LOVE

16:28.900 --> 16:29.866
TO ARGUE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD

16:29.933 --> 16:31.266
BE RUN LIKE A BUSINESS, BUT TEND

16:31.333 --> 16:33.566
TO CONVENIENTLY FORGET THAT SOME

16:33.633 --> 16:35.033
EXTREMELY VALUABLE COMPANIES GOT

16:35.100 --> 16:36.600
THAT WAY, IN PART, BECAUSE THEY

16:36.666 --> 16:38.066
HAD LONG PERIODS WHERE THEY

16:38.133 --> 16:39.366
SPENT A SHITLOAD MORE THAN THEY

16:39.433 --> 16:41.033
TOOK IN.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.466
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, ALREADY,

16:42.533 --> 16:45.933
THINGS ARE A LOT MORE NUANCED

16:46.000 --> 16:46.766
THAN SIMPLY, "HEY, UNCLE SAM,

16:46.833 --> 16:50.366
PLEASE STOP DIGGING."

16:50.433 --> 16:51.400
AND IT IS WORTH TAKING A MOMENT

16:51.466 --> 16:53.466
TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE

16:53.533 --> 16:54.166
DEBATE OVER THE NATIONAL DEBT.

16:54.233 --> 16:57.233
BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT REPUBLICANS

16:57.300 --> 16:58.400
OFTEN MAKE IS THAT THEY ARE THE

16:58.466 --> 16:59.000
RESPONSIBLE ONES WHO WANT TO

16:59.066 --> 17:00.366
REDUCE THE DEBT AND REIN IN

17:00.433 --> 17:01.666
SPENDING, WHEREAS DEMOCRATS

17:01.733 --> 17:02.500
DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE

17:02.566 --> 17:03.533
DEBT, AND JUST LOVE RECKLESSLY

17:03.600 --> 17:04.766
THROWING MONEY AROUND.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.966
BUT THAT STORY JUST DOES NOT

17:07.033 --> 17:07.800
MATCH UP TO REALITY.

17:07.866 --> 17:09.000
TAKE RONALD REAGAN.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.500
HE SPENT YEARS COMPLAINING THAT

17:10.566 --> 17:11.666
DEFICITS WERE A SIGN THAT THE

17:11.733 --> 17:12.766
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD SIMPLY

17:12.833 --> 17:14.466
LOST ITS WAY.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.966
>> I THINK THE ANSWER TO CURING

17:16.033 --> 17:18.600
INFLATION IS A BALANCED BUDGET.

17:18.666 --> 17:21.166
>> NOW, HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

17:21.233 --> 17:22.000
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT -- HOW DO YOU

17:22.066 --> 17:23.733
BALANCE THE BUDGET?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.800
>> WELL, BALANCING THE BUDGET IS

17:25.866 --> 17:26.366
LIKE PROTECTING YOUR VIRT --

17:26.433 --> 17:27.166
>> YOU DON'T SPEND MORE THAN YOU

17:27.233 --> 17:27.833
TAKE IN.

17:27.900 --> 17:28.633
RIGHT?

17:28.700 --> 17:29.300
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE PROTECTING

17:29.366 --> 17:30.333
YOUR VIRTUE.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.400
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO.

17:33.466 --> 17:33.666
[LAUGHTER]

17:33.733 --> 17:35.333
[APPLAUSE]

17:35.400 --> 17:36.666
>> John: REALLY?

17:36.733 --> 17:39.033
AN APPLAUSE BREAK?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.633
IS THERE ANYTHING WEIRDER THAN

17:40.700 --> 17:41.700
CALLING SOMEONE'S VIRGINITY

17:41.766 --> 17:43.300
THEIR VIRTUE?

17:43.366 --> 17:48.233
BECAUSE AS FAR AS VIRTUES GO,

17:48.300 --> 17:49.466
IT IS A PRETTY SHITTY ONE.

17:49.533 --> 17:50.200
I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S SOMETHING

17:50.266 --> 17:50.966
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH NOT HAVING

17:51.033 --> 17:51.700
SEX.

17:51.766 --> 17:52.633
THAT'S A PERSONAL CHOICE.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.433
I'VE FREQUENTLY NOT HAD SEX

17:53.500 --> 17:54.200
DUE TO LOTS OF PEOPLE'S

17:54.266 --> 17:56.800
PERSONAL CHOICES.

17:56.866 --> 17:57.966
BUT IF THAT IS THE BEST THING

17:58.033 --> 17:58.700
ABOUT YOU, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

17:58.766 --> 17:59.866
GET SOME OTHER VIRTUES.

17:59.933 --> 18:02.233
BUT THE KEY THING TO KNOW IS,

18:02.300 --> 18:03.433
REAGAN DIDN'T, IN FACT, END UP

18:03.500 --> 18:04.266
SPENDING HIS PRESIDENCY SAYING

18:04.333 --> 18:05.700
NO.

18:05.766 --> 18:07.266
BECAUSE HE WASN'T REALLY

18:07.333 --> 18:08.833
PROMISING NOT TO SPEND MONEY,

18:08.900 --> 18:10.166
SO MUCH AS PROMISING NOT TO

18:10.233 --> 18:12.633
SPEND IT ON CERTAIN PEOPLE.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.233
HIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC ABOUT

18:14.300 --> 18:15.833
"WELFARE QUEENS" PLAYED INTO THE

18:15.900 --> 18:16.900
RACIST TROPE THAT BLACK PEOPLE

18:16.966 --> 18:18.066
WERE FRAUDULENTLY BENEFITING

18:18.133 --> 18:19.233
FROM WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT

18:19.300 --> 18:20.500
SPENDING.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.300
AND AS PRESIDENT, HE FOLLOWED

18:23.366 --> 18:24.866
THROUGH BY MAKING CUTS TO BASIC

18:24.933 --> 18:26.333
ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY

18:26.400 --> 18:27.866
NET, LIKE FOOD STAMPS, WELFARE,

18:27.933 --> 18:31.266
AND MEDICAID.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.933
BUT HE ALSO MASSIVELY INCREASED

18:33.000 --> 18:35.166
DEFENSE SPENDING, WHILE CUTTING

18:35.233 --> 18:36.933
TAXES, SO THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IN

18:37.000 --> 18:38.466
LESS MONEY, CREATING LARGE

18:38.533 --> 18:40.200
DEFICITS THAT WOUND UP TRIPLING

18:40.266 --> 18:41.400
THE NATIONAL DEBT.

18:41.466 --> 18:43.300
WHICH I GUESS, IN HIS TERMS,

18:43.366 --> 18:44.633
MADE REAGAN AMERICA'S HOTTEST

18:44.700 --> 18:46.566
LITTLE SLUT.

18:46.633 --> 18:48.266
THEN CAME THESE TWO GUYS.

18:48.333 --> 18:53.800
AND BETWEEN BUSH SENIOR AND

18:53.866 --> 18:55.933
CLINTON, THEY MORE OR LESS DID

18:56.000 --> 18:56.900
WHAT REAGAN HAD PROMISED TO DO:

18:56.966 --> 18:58.133
CUTTING SPENDING AND RAISING

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
TAXES ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE

18:59.266 --> 19:00.033
BUDGET SURPLUSES BY THE END

19:00.100 --> 19:01.100
OF THE '90s.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.066
AND THE DEBT WAS BRIEFLY

19:02.133 --> 19:03.466
STARTING TO COME DOWN, UNTIL

19:03.533 --> 19:05.233
THIS LOVABLE HUMAN RIGHTS

19:05.300 --> 19:07.966
VIOLATION ENTERED THE PICTURE.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.400
BECAUSE HE IMMEDIATELY SIGNED

19:09.466 --> 19:11.566
A MASSIVE TAX CUT, LAUNCHED AN

19:11.633 --> 19:12.900
EXPENSIVE WAR ON TERROR, AND

19:12.966 --> 19:14.100
THEN SIGNED A SECOND ROUND OF

19:14.166 --> 19:15.233
TAX CUTS.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.566
ALL OF WHICH MADE OUR NATIONAL

19:17.633 --> 19:18.500
DEBT EXPLODE, BUT REPUBLICANS,

19:18.566 --> 19:19.766
STRANGELY, DIDN'T SEEM TO GIVE

19:19.833 --> 19:21.233
A SHIT.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.533
UNTIL, THAT IS, OBAMA BECAME

19:22.600 --> 19:24.133
PRESIDENT.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.033
HE INHERITED A HISTORIC

19:26.100 --> 19:27.433
RECESSION, AND IMMEDIATELY

19:27.500 --> 19:29.800
SIGNED A LARGE STIMULUS BILL,

19:29.866 --> 19:31.266
BUT AFTERWARDS WAS MET WITH

19:31.333 --> 19:32.666
FERVENT OPPOSITION TO ANY

19:32.733 --> 19:34.133
ADDITIONAL SPENDING, MAINLY FROM

19:34.200 --> 19:35.366
REPUBLICANS WHO HAD SUDDENLY

19:35.433 --> 19:37.166
RE-FOUND THEIR HATRED FOR

19:37.233 --> 19:39.466
"DEFICITS," SOMETIMES EXPRESSING

19:39.533 --> 19:43.533
IT IN TRULY REMARKABLE WAYS.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.166
>> OUR FREE STUFF TODAY IS BEING

19:46.233 --> 19:49.666
PAID FOR BY TAKING MONEY FROM

19:49.733 --> 19:51.733
OUR CHILDREN AND BORROWING FROM

19:51.800 --> 19:55.500
CHINA.

19:55.566 --> 19:58.566
WHEN THAT NOTE COMES DUE -- AND

19:58.633 --> 20:01.800
THIS ISN'T RACIST, SO, YEAH, TRY

20:01.866 --> 20:02.500
IT, TRY IT ANYWAY, THIS ISN'T

20:02.566 --> 20:04.000
RACIST -- BUT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

20:04.066 --> 20:05.900
SLAVERY WHEN THAT NOTE IS DUE,

20:05.966 --> 20:06.200
RIGHT?

20:06.266 --> 20:07.266
WE ARE GONNA BE BEHOLDEN TO A

20:07.333 --> 20:11.633
FOREIGN MASTER.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.833
>> John: UH, YEAH, NO.

20:12.900 --> 20:13.600
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW ANY OF THAT

20:13.666 --> 20:14.433
WORKS.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
THE DEBT ISN'T GOING TO JUST

20:15.566 --> 20:16.233
SUDDENLY "COME DUE," ALL AT

20:16.300 --> 20:17.300
ONCE.

20:17.366 --> 20:18.866
AND BEING IN DEBT TO SOMEONE

20:18.933 --> 20:19.900
ISN'T THE SAME AS BEING ENSLAVED

20:19.966 --> 20:21.100
BY THEM.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.500
IF YOU THINK A PORTION OF US

20:22.566 --> 20:23.866
TREASURY BONDS BEING OWNED BY

20:23.933 --> 20:26.166
FOREIGN INVESTORS IS ANYTHING

20:26.233 --> 20:27.533
LIKE SLAVERY, YOU KNOW BOTH

20:27.600 --> 20:29.066
A VERY SMALL AMOUNT ABOUT

20:29.133 --> 20:30.433
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND A VERY

20:30.500 --> 20:35.166
RACIST AMOUNT ABOUT SLAVERY.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.300
ALSO JUST GENERALLY: EVEN IF YOU

20:36.366 --> 20:37.266
PREFACE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T

20:37.333 --> 20:38.966
RACIST WITH "THIS ISN'T RACIST,"

20:39.033 --> 20:40.366
IT WILL STILL SOUND RACIST.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.566
I'LL SHOW YOU: IF YOU SAID,

20:41.633 --> 20:43.066
"A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY JEANS AT

20:43.133 --> 20:44.533
OLD NAVY" -- TOTALLY FINE.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.466
BUT IF YOU SAID, "A LOT OF

20:45.533 --> 20:47.200
PEOPLE -- AND THIS ISN'T RACIST,

20:47.266 --> 20:49.633
YEAH, TRY IT, TRY IT ANYWAY,

20:49.700 --> 20:50.900
THIS ISN'T RACIST -- BUT A LOT

20:50.966 --> 20:52.800
OF PEOPLE BUY JEANS AT

20:52.866 --> 20:54.666
OLD NAVY," NOW THAT SUDDENLY

20:54.733 --> 20:56.033
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S

20:56.100 --> 20:56.633
GOING TO REQUIRE ABOUT THREE

20:56.700 --> 20:58.100
PAGES OF YOUR NOTES APP.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.666
AND THE THING IS, REPUBLICANS

20:59.733 --> 21:01.033
PUTTING THE BRAKES ON OBAMA'S

21:01.100 --> 21:02.033
RECOVERY SPENDING IS NOW WIDELY

21:02.100 --> 21:03.066
CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN A BIG

21:03.133 --> 21:05.366
MISTAKE.

21:05.433 --> 21:06.666
MOST EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE

21:06.733 --> 21:08.333
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SPEND

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
AS MUCH ON STIMULUS AS IT SHOULD

21:10.466 --> 21:12.066
HAVE FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL

21:12.133 --> 21:13.833
CRISIS, FORCING STATE AND LOCAL

21:13.900 --> 21:15.033
GOVERNMENTS INTO AUSTERITY THAT

21:15.100 --> 21:17.300
DELAYED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BY

21:17.366 --> 21:19.333
ABOUT FOUR YEARS.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.766
AND THEN CAME THIS FUCKING GUY.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.500
HE CAMPAIGNED ON ELIMINATING THE

21:24.566 --> 21:26.466
ENTIRE NATIONAL DEBT, ONLY TO

21:26.533 --> 21:28.500
THEN IMPLEMENT AN ABSOLUTELY

21:28.566 --> 21:30.333
MASSIVE TAX CUT, RESULTING IN

21:30.400 --> 21:32.033
HUGE DEFICITS.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.633
MOST CORPORATIONS WHO BENEFITED

21:33.700 --> 21:34.600
USED THE MONEY NOT ON

21:34.666 --> 21:35.633
INVESTMENTS IN THINGS LIKE

21:35.700 --> 21:36.466
FACTORIES, BUT ON STOCK

21:36.533 --> 21:38.066
BUYBACKS.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.433
AS FOR INDIVIDUALS, NEARLY HALF

21:40.500 --> 21:41.800
THE TAX CUTS WENT TO THE TOP

21:41.866 --> 21:43.300
FIVE PERCENT OF INCOME EARNERS.

21:43.366 --> 21:44.900
SO WE GAVE MORE MONEY TO PEOPLE

21:44.966 --> 21:47.633
WHO ALREADY HAD IT.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.066
AND DESPITE CLAIMING THAT

21:49.133 --> 21:50.333
TRUMP'S TAX CUTS WOULD

21:50.400 --> 21:54.100
"PAY FOR THEMSELVES,"

21:54.166 --> 21:55.966
THEY VERY MUCH DID NOT.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.733
IN FACT, THEY DID SO LITTLE TO

21:57.800 --> 22:00.966
BOOST THE ECONOMY, THEY'RE

22:01.033 --> 22:01.966
PROJECTED TO COST US

22:02.033 --> 22:02.833
$1.9 TRILLION OVER

22:02.900 --> 22:04.266
A 10-YEAR PERIOD.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.566
ALL OF WHICH CLEARLY LEFT SOME

22:05.633 --> 22:06.100
"FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE"

22:06.166 --> 22:07.000
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THOSE

22:07.066 --> 22:08.033
TAX CUTS IN A PRETTY AWKWARD

22:08.100 --> 22:13.000
POSITION.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.466
>> UA BELONG TO A PARTY THAT HAS

22:15.533 --> 22:16.466
GREEN LIGHT TO HISTORIC

22:16.533 --> 22:19.400
EXPANSION OF DEFICITS AND DEBT.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.133
AND IT'S JUST A PLAIN FACT.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.033
>> DO I WISH THAT IT WAS A

22:25.100 --> 22:27.433
HIGHER PRIORITY FOR THE

22:27.500 --> 22:29.166
PRESIDENT TO REIN IN SPENDING ON

22:29.233 --> 22:29.433
THE DEBT?

22:29.500 --> 22:29.833
YES.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.933
>> DO YOU THINK YOUR COLLEAGUES,

22:31.000 --> 22:31.933
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WILL

22:32.000 --> 22:32.500
REDISCOVER ITS CONCERN ABOUT

22:32.566 --> 22:33.133
DEBT AND DEFICITS?

22:33.200 --> 22:33.833
>> OH, SURE.

22:33.900 --> 22:34.533
SURE.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.666
>> I MEAN, ISN'T THAT THE MOST

22:36.733 --> 22:37.700
CYNICAL, PHONY THING --

22:37.766 --> 22:38.366
>> OH, LOOK, THERE'S AN ELEMENT

22:38.433 --> 22:39.066
OF IT.

22:39.133 --> 22:39.800
>> DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU WANNA

22:39.866 --> 22:40.666
PUKE?

22:40.733 --> 22:41.333
>> YOU'RE TOUCHING INTO

22:41.400 --> 22:42.433
SOMETHING THAT, AS YOU KNOW,

22:42.500 --> 22:43.766
I HAVE RAGED AGAINST.

22:43.833 --> 22:44.566
>> John: I DO NOT LIKE THAT MAN

22:44.633 --> 22:45.800
TED CRUZ.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.033
I DO NOT LIKE HIS FAR RIGHT

22:47.100 --> 22:47.966
VIEWS.

22:48.033 --> 22:48.933
I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN THESE

22:49.033 --> 22:49.533
REEDS.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.500
I DO NOT LIKE HIM WHEN HE FEEDS.

22:51.566 --> 22:53.700
I DO NOT LIKE HIM BY A WALL.

22:53.766 --> 22:55.833
I DO NOT LIKE THIS SHIT AT ALL.

22:55.900 --> 22:56.833
I DO NOT LIKE HIM AS SANTA'S

22:56.900 --> 22:57.800
ELF.

22:57.866 --> 22:58.700
THAT MAN TED CRUZ CAN FUCK

22:58.766 --> 23:03.133
HIMSELF.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.933
THAT IS A PRETTY FLAGRANT

23:05.000 --> 23:06.200
ADMISSION OF A DOUBLE STANDARD.

23:06.266 --> 23:07.833
THE ONLY CLEARER EXAMPLE MAY

23:07.900 --> 23:08.900
HAVE BEEN WHEN MICK MULVANEY,

23:08.966 --> 23:10.100
TRUMP'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF,

23:10.166 --> 23:11.066
SAID, "THE WORST THING IN THE

23:11.133 --> 23:12.266
WHOLE WORLD IS DEFICITS WHEN

23:12.333 --> 23:13.900
BARACK OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT.

23:13.966 --> 23:14.866
THEN DONALD TRUMP BECAME

23:14.933 --> 23:16.033
PRESIDENT, AND WE'RE A LOT LESS

23:16.100 --> 23:20.200
INTERESTED AS A PARTY."

23:20.266 --> 23:20.800
AND THAT IS JUST FLAT-OUT

23:20.866 --> 23:23.133
ADMITTING THE WHOLE GAME.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.666
BUT EVEN IF YOU PUT ALL OF THAT

23:24.733 --> 23:28.000
BAD-FAITH HYPOCRISY ASIDE,

23:28.066 --> 23:29.000
WE ARE STILL LEFT WITH

23:29.066 --> 23:29.733
THE KEY QUESTION:

23:29.800 --> 23:30.866
HOW MUCH DEBT IS TOO MUCH?

23:30.933 --> 23:32.366
AND THE INTERESTING ANSWER TO

23:32.433 --> 23:35.066
THAT IS, "NOBODY REALLY KNOWS."

23:35.133 --> 23:36.333
FOR MANY YEARS, WE THOUGHT

23:36.400 --> 23:37.466
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE DEBT

23:37.533 --> 23:37.966
WAS TO COMPARE IT TO

23:38.033 --> 23:39.900
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

23:39.966 --> 23:41.733
BASICALLY, MEASURING HOW MUCH IN

23:41.800 --> 23:43.300
TOTAL THE COUNTRY OWES, VERSUS

23:43.366 --> 23:44.800
HOW MUCH IT PRODUCES EACH YEAR.

23:44.866 --> 23:46.166
AND THE ECONOMIC CONSENSUS WAS

23:46.233 --> 23:48.100
THAT DEBT EXCEEDING GDP -- OR

23:48.166 --> 23:50.666
EVEN GETTING CLOSE TO IT -- WAS

23:50.733 --> 23:52.933
A HARD RED LINE THAT COULD NOT

23:53.000 --> 23:54.033
BE CROSSED WITHOUT RISKING

23:54.100 --> 23:55.566
A FINANCIAL CRISIS.

23:55.633 --> 23:56.866
IT WAS SOMETHING OCCASIONALLY

23:56.933 --> 23:58.166
EXPRESSED IN FAIRLY OVER-THE-TOP

23:58.233 --> 23:59.366
WAYS, LIKE IN THIS JOHN STOSSEL

23:59.433 --> 24:00.800
CLIP FROM 2011.

24:00.866 --> 24:01.933
>> OUR GOVERNMENT KEEPS

24:02.000 --> 24:02.866
SPENDING.

24:02.933 --> 24:04.200
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALREADY

24:04.266 --> 24:07.500
$14.5 TRILLION IN DEBT.

24:07.566 --> 24:08.500
BUT YOU COULD SAY, "SO WHAT?

24:08.566 --> 24:09.266
LOOK AROUND.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.366
AMERICA'S DOING PRETTY WELL.

24:10.433 --> 24:11.433
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD

24:11.500 --> 24:14.500
HAPPEN?"

24:14.566 --> 24:17.400
WELL, THIS COULD HAPPEN.

24:17.466 --> 24:18.700
THESE VIOLENT PROTESTS BROKE OUT

24:18.766 --> 24:20.333
ONCE GREECE WAS SO DEEP IN DEBT

24:20.400 --> 24:21.333
THAT GREECE HAD TROUBLE

24:21.400 --> 24:24.300
BORROWING MORE MONEY.

24:24.366 --> 24:25.433
GREECE SPENT SO MUCH THAT

24:25.500 --> 24:26.333
BY LAST YEAR, THEY OWED MORE

24:26.400 --> 24:27.233
MONEY THAN THEIR ENTIRE ECONOMY

24:27.300 --> 24:28.733
PRODUCED.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.933
NO WONDER THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.266
WE WON'T REACH THAT LEVEL OF

24:33.333 --> 24:34.600
DEBT UNTIL, WELL, OOPS.

24:34.666 --> 24:37.100
PRETTY SOON.

24:37.166 --> 24:38.266
WE'RE ON A CLEAR TRACK TO A

24:38.333 --> 24:39.833
GREEK-TYPE CRISIS.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.033
>> John: OH, COME ON, STOSSEL!

24:42.100 --> 24:43.366
CUTTING TO FOOTAGE OF A RIOT

24:43.433 --> 24:45.233
CAN MAKE ANYTHING SEEM MORE DIRE

24:45.300 --> 24:47.600
THAN MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE CASE.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.633
I'LL PROVE IT: REGE-JEAN PAGE IS

24:49.700 --> 24:50.266
APPARENTLY NOT APPEARING ON THE

24:50.333 --> 24:51.400
SECOND SEASON OF "BRIDGERTON."

24:51.466 --> 24:52.266
SO WHAT?

24:52.333 --> 24:53.333
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD

24:53.400 --> 24:55.233
HAPPEN?

24:55.300 --> 24:58.066
>> WELL, THIS COULD HAPPEN.

24:58.133 --> 25:01.666
>> John: OH SHIT!

25:01.733 --> 25:02.533
FEELS PRETTY SCARY, DOESN'T IT?

25:02.600 --> 25:03.700
BUT THE TRUTH IS MUCH MORE

25:03.766 --> 25:04.466
COMPLEX.

25:04.533 --> 25:05.366
BECAUSE, A, HIS CHARACTER ARC

25:05.433 --> 25:06.100
IS MOSTLY WRAPPED UP AND

25:06.166 --> 25:06.833
THE DUKE DOESN'T APPEAR IN

25:06.900 --> 25:07.566
THE REST OF THE NOVELS.

25:07.633 --> 25:08.766
IT'S REALLY A GENERATIONAL STORY

25:08.833 --> 25:10.766
OF A WHOLE FAMILY!

25:10.833 --> 25:11.366
ALSO, YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY

25:11.433 --> 25:12.466
LOSE THE DUKE!

25:12.533 --> 25:13.933
IT'S ACTUALLY PERFECTLY

25:14.000 --> 25:14.766
IN HIS CHARACTER TO START

25:14.833 --> 25:17.333
SOMETHING HE DOESN'T FINISH.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.233
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLEX WHEN IT

25:20.300 --> 25:21.700
COMES TO OUR ECONOMY, TOO.

25:21.766 --> 25:22.633
BECAUSE SOMETHING FASCINATING

25:22.700 --> 25:24.200
HAPPENED AROUND LAST JUNE:

25:24.266 --> 25:25.200
LARGELY BECAUSE OF INCREASED

25:25.266 --> 25:26.333
BORROWING RESULTING FROM THE

25:26.400 --> 25:28.166
FIRST ROUND OF COVID STIMULUS,

25:28.233 --> 25:29.900
OUR NATIONAL DEBT ACTUALLY

25:29.966 --> 25:33.033
SURPASSED THE SIZE OF OUR GDP.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.000
YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE GREECE.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.466
BUT ALL THOSE DISASTER SCENARIOS

25:36.533 --> 25:37.500
THAT JOHN STOSSEL'S

25:37.566 --> 25:39.133
PERFORMATIVELY EXAGGERATED VOICE

25:39.200 --> 25:40.533
FLUCTUATIONS WARNED US ABOUT?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.666
NONE OF THEM HAPPENED.

25:42.733 --> 25:44.533
IT DIDN'T SUDDENLY COST US A LOT

25:44.600 --> 25:45.700
MORE TO BORROW MONEY DUE TO

25:45.766 --> 25:46.466
HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

25:46.533 --> 25:47.533
WE DIDN'T, AS YOU MAY HAVE

25:47.600 --> 25:49.266
NOTICED, BECOME GREECE.

25:49.333 --> 25:52.000
IN FACT, DESPITE ADDING

25:52.066 --> 25:54.300
$4 TRILLION TO THE DEBT LAST

25:54.366 --> 25:56.166
YEAR, INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THAT

25:56.233 --> 25:57.700
DEBT ACTUALLY DECLINED.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.100
AND THAT ISN'T EVEN A ONE-OFF:

25:59.166 --> 26:00.933
AS OUR DEBT HAS RISEN IN RECENT

26:01.000 --> 26:02.233
YEARS, INTEREST RATES HAVE

26:02.300 --> 26:04.600
FALLEN TO HISTORIC LOWS.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.633
SO WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THAT?

26:06.700 --> 26:09.633
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.000
I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST, NOR DO I

26:11.066 --> 26:13.000
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MATH.

26:13.066 --> 26:13.800
WHICH I KNOW MAY BE SURPRISING,

26:13.866 --> 26:15.233
GIVEN THAT I HAVE THE FACE OF

26:15.300 --> 26:16.600
SOMEONE WHO HAS A FAVORITE KIND

26:16.666 --> 26:18.700
OF GRAPHING CALCULATOR.

26:18.766 --> 26:20.266
WHAT IS SHOCKING IS THAT EVEN

26:20.333 --> 26:21.933
EXPERT ECONOMISTS CAN'T REALLY

26:22.000 --> 26:23.466
EXPLAIN IT EITHER.

26:23.533 --> 26:24.900
HERE'S THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE

26:24.966 --> 26:28.166
IMF BASICALLY ADMITTING AS MUCH.

26:28.233 --> 26:29.800
>> TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, WE DO

26:29.866 --> 26:31.400
NOT -- AT LEAST I DO NOT,

26:31.466 --> 26:32.633
I DON'T WANT TO TALK FOR THE

26:32.700 --> 26:34.666
PROFESSION -- WE'VE HAD THIS

26:34.733 --> 26:36.133
STEADY DECREASE IN THE INTEREST

26:36.200 --> 26:38.566
RATE SINCE THE MID '80s,

26:38.633 --> 26:39.966
CONTINUING A BIT MORE

26:40.033 --> 26:41.400
IN THE CRISIS, BUT, YOU KNOW,

26:41.466 --> 26:42.966
CONTINUING NOW.

26:43.033 --> 26:46.033
AND WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.933
>> John: YEAH, THEY DON'T KNOW!

26:48.000 --> 26:49.333
NOW, HE WENT ON TO POINT OUT

26:49.400 --> 26:50.200
THAT THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF

26:50.266 --> 26:51.300
POSSIBILITIES.

26:51.366 --> 26:52.700
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

26:52.766 --> 26:53.733
AGING POPULATIONS IN ADVANCED

26:53.800 --> 26:55.066
ECONOMIES, CHINA'S HIGH SAVINGS

26:55.133 --> 26:56.500
RATE, THE GENERAL LACK OF

26:56.566 --> 26:57.600
CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INVESTMENT

26:57.666 --> 26:58.833
OPPORTUNITIES, OR MERELY THE

26:58.900 --> 26:59.833
FACT THAT RICHARD CAMPBELL OF

26:59.900 --> 27:01.633
OMAHA, NEBRASKA, HASN'T STEPPED

27:01.700 --> 27:02.233
ON A CRACK IN THE SIDEWALK IN

27:02.300 --> 27:03.600
OVER 30 YEARS.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.066
BUT THE POINT IS, ECONOMISTS

27:05.133 --> 27:07.833
REALLY HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.300
IN FACT, THE CONGRESSIONAL

27:09.366 --> 27:11.266
BUDGET OFFICE HAS NOW SAID THAT

27:11.333 --> 27:14.366
THE DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO HAS NO SET

27:14.433 --> 27:18.066
TIPPING POINT WHERE A FINANCIAL

27:18.133 --> 27:18.500
CRISIS IS IMMINENT.

27:18.566 --> 27:20.533
SO TAKEN TOGETHER, ALL OF THIS

27:20.600 --> 27:21.966
HAS MADE MANY ECONOMISTS START

27:22.033 --> 27:22.533
CHANGING THE WAY THEY THINK

27:22.600 --> 27:24.200
ABOUT DEBT.

27:24.266 --> 27:26.233
THINKING THAT VERY BASICALLY,

27:26.300 --> 27:27.333
SO LONG AS OUR ECONOMY GROWS

27:27.400 --> 27:28.900
AT A RATE GREATER THAN THE

27:28.966 --> 27:30.000
INTEREST WE'RE PAYING ON OUR

27:30.066 --> 27:32.433
DEBT, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.533
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU'D COME

27:33.600 --> 27:35.533
OUT AHEAD IF YOU BORROWED MONEY

27:35.600 --> 27:37.066
AT 2% INTEREST AND THEN INVESTED

27:37.133 --> 27:39.933
IT SOMEWHERE AND GOT 5% RETURNS.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.466
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS, THIS

27:41.533 --> 27:43.100
WHOLE FIELD IS IN A BIT OF FLUX

27:43.166 --> 27:45.266
RIGHT NOW.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.566
SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT WE

27:47.633 --> 27:48.700
SHOULDN'T GET COMPLACENT -- THAT

27:48.766 --> 27:50.033
A DEBT CRISIS IS STILL ON THE

27:50.100 --> 27:51.766
HORIZON, JUST NOT AT THE TIPPING

27:51.833 --> 27:53.933
POINT WE'D PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.166
ANOTHER, MORE RADICAL ARGUMENT,

27:57.233 --> 27:58.900
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN IN

27:58.966 --> 28:00.433
FACT CREATE ALL THE MONEY IT

28:00.500 --> 28:01.633
NEEDS TO PAY FOR STUFF,

28:01.700 --> 28:02.333
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T GENERATE

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
INFLATION.

28:03.466 --> 28:05.166
THE POINT IS, THERE IS A

28:05.233 --> 28:06.500
GOOD-FAITH DEBATE TO BE HAD OVER

28:06.566 --> 28:08.133
HOW TO HANDLE OUR NATIONAL DEBT

28:08.200 --> 28:10.366
OVER THE LONG TERM.

28:10.433 --> 28:11.933
BUT RIGHT NOW, MOST ECONOMISTS

28:12.000 --> 28:13.633
ACTUALLY AGREE THAT, WITH

28:13.700 --> 28:15.666
INTEREST RATES AT HISTORIC LOWS,

28:15.733 --> 28:17.033
THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T REALLY

28:17.100 --> 28:17.933
BE, "HOW MUCH DEBT ARE WE TAKING

28:18.000 --> 28:19.200
ON?"

28:19.266 --> 28:21.200
AS MUCH AS, "WHAT IS THE VALUE

28:21.266 --> 28:21.866
OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR IT IN

28:21.933 --> 28:23.600
RETURN?"

28:23.666 --> 28:24.833
AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY DUMB

28:24.900 --> 28:26.633
FISCAL DECISIONS WE COULD MAKE,

28:26.700 --> 28:28.566
LIKE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.066
WE'VE TRIED THAT MULTIPLE TIMES,

28:31.133 --> 28:32.766
AND IF THEY WERE THE MAGIC KEY

28:32.833 --> 28:34.166
TO ELIMINATING OUR DEBT

28:34.233 --> 28:35.300
LONG-TERM, WE PROBABLY WOULD

28:35.366 --> 28:36.466
HAVE SEEN SIGNS OF IT WORKING

28:36.533 --> 28:37.866
BY NOW.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.600
BUT THERE ARE SMART FINANCIAL

28:39.666 --> 28:41.966
DECISIONS, THAT MORE THAN

28:42.033 --> 28:43.466
JUSTIFY GOING INTO DEBT, LIKE

28:43.533 --> 28:45.666
SPENDING ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS,

28:45.733 --> 28:46.533
INFRASTRUCTURE, OR,

28:46.600 --> 28:48.400
ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL,

28:48.466 --> 28:51.033
THIS NICOLAS CAGE PILLOW.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.366
IT'S THE SECOND BEST INVESTMENT

28:52.433 --> 28:52.900
I'VE EVER MADE, AFTER, OF

28:52.966 --> 28:53.900
COURSE, BUYING ANOTHER

28:53.966 --> 28:55.666
NICOLAS CAGE PILLOW.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.166
I WAS WORRIED MY WIFE WOULD GET

28:57.233 --> 28:58.166
JEALOUS, SO THIS ONE IS TO

28:58.233 --> 29:00.400
REPLACE MY WIFE.

29:00.466 --> 29:03.700
AND AMIDST THE CURRENT CRISIS,

29:03.766 --> 29:05.866
MANY EXPERTS ARE LESS CONCERNED

29:05.933 --> 29:07.200
ABOUT US SPENDING TOO MUCH

29:07.266 --> 29:09.433
THAN SPENDING TOO LITTLE.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.433
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT

29:10.500 --> 29:12.200
INFLATION OR INTEREST RATES

29:12.266 --> 29:13.766
DO START TO RISE, WE SHOULD

29:13.833 --> 29:15.166
ABSOLUTELY START CUTTING

29:15.233 --> 29:17.800
DEFICITS, ALTHOUGH NOT BY

29:17.866 --> 29:18.866
CUTTING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

29:18.933 --> 29:20.100
PEOPLE NEED, BUT THROUGH TAXING

29:20.166 --> 29:22.733
PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.266
LOOK, NO ONE CREDIBLE IS SAYING

29:26.333 --> 29:27.500
DEFICITS DON'T MATTER, OR THAT

29:27.566 --> 29:28.700
WE SHOULD BORROW AS IF THE SKY'S

29:28.766 --> 29:29.600
THE LIMIT.

29:29.666 --> 29:30.633
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS,

29:30.700 --> 29:32.000
THE DEBATE SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT

29:32.066 --> 29:33.666
WHETHER DEBT IS GOOD OR BAD.

29:33.733 --> 29:35.500
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT WHETHER

29:35.566 --> 29:36.866
THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING

29:36.933 --> 29:38.600
ARE WORTH IT OR NOT.

29:38.666 --> 29:39.766
AND IF YOU'RE STILL WORRIED

29:39.833 --> 29:41.500
ABOUT DEBT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN

29:41.566 --> 29:42.700
TOLD YOU'RE BURDENING YOUR

29:42.766 --> 29:44.500
CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S

29:44.566 --> 29:46.100
CHILDREN, WELL, I HAVE SOME GOOD

29:46.166 --> 29:47.033
NEWS: THOSE FUTURE GENERATIONS

29:47.100 --> 29:54.400
HAVE A SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR YOU.

29:54.466 --> 29:55.400
>> HELLO.

29:55.466 --> 29:55.966
>> HELLO.

29:56.033 --> 29:57.033
>> HEY THERE.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.366
>> WE ARE YOUR CHILDREN.

29:59.433 --> 30:01.433
>> YOUR GRANDCHILDREN.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.566
>> AND YOUR GREAT GRANDCHILDREN.

30:02.633 --> 30:05.033
>> AND WE HAVE A MESSAGE FOR

30:05.100 --> 30:05.200
YOU.

30:05.266 --> 30:06.866
>> STOP USING US TO SCARE US

30:06.933 --> 30:07.800
ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT.

30:07.866 --> 30:10.433
>> YOU IDIOTS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

30:10.500 --> 30:11.066
IT WORKS.

30:11.133 --> 30:13.166
>> TAKE THE STUPID DEBT CLOCK.

30:13.233 --> 30:15.366
>> DO EVEN KNOW WHAT A CLOCK

30:15.433 --> 30:15.533
IS?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.366
>> CLOCK, NOT A CLOCK.

30:17.433 --> 30:20.033
>> ALSO, THAT ISN'T ALWAYS A BAD

30:20.100 --> 30:20.233
THING.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.200
>> YES, GOING INTO DEBT TO GIVE

30:23.266 --> 30:23.900
MONEY BACK TO PEOPLE ALREADY

30:23.966 --> 30:25.066
HAVE TOO MUCH IS STUPID.

30:25.133 --> 30:27.366
>> LOOK AT THIS GUY.

30:27.433 --> 30:28.466
SLICK FLAME THROWER, BRO.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.833
>> YOU CAN USE THAT TO BUILD NEW

30:31.900 --> 30:33.166
BRIROADS ROADS AND BRIDGES.

30:33.233 --> 30:35.600
>> YOU CAN USE IT TO IMPROVE

30:35.666 --> 30:37.200
SCHOOLS, WHICH WOULD MAKE US

30:37.266 --> 30:38.066
INTO A BETTER LABOR FORCE.

30:38.133 --> 30:40.466
>> YOU CAN USE OR TO IMPROVE

30:40.533 --> 30:40.766
HEALTH CARE.

30:40.833 --> 30:42.066
>> YOU CAN EVEN USE IT TO BUY

30:42.133 --> 30:45.300
THESE PILLOWS, WHICH WILL BECOME

30:45.366 --> 30:46.500
TREASURED FAMILY HEIRLOOMS.

30:46.566 --> 30:47.700
THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT DEBT

30:47.766 --> 30:48.966
IS WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.900
>> AND WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.600
YOU SEE, DEBT CAN BE A TOOL FOR

30:52.666 --> 30:52.966
GROWTH.

30:53.033 --> 30:55.766
IN FACT, THE DEBT TO GDP RATIO

30:55.833 --> 30:57.500
IS NOT AS RELIABLE A METRIC AS

30:57.566 --> 30:58.066
ASSUMED.

30:58.133 --> 31:00.300
THEY TURNED OUT TO BE LARGELY

31:00.366 --> 31:01.933
FLAWED, GIVEN THE CONTINUING

31:02.000 --> 31:02.500
INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

31:02.566 --> 31:03.233
RISING DEBT AND LOW INTEREST

31:03.300 --> 31:03.433
RATES.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.500
SO IT FOLLOWS, THE ECONOMY'S

31:06.566 --> 31:09.733
CAPACITY TO IMPROVE DEBT WITHOUT

31:09.800 --> 31:11.633
FOLLOWING MASSIVE INCREASES.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.400
>> IT IS SO SIMPLE.

31:13.466 --> 31:14.700
>> THE EASIEST THING IN THE

31:14.766 --> 31:14.966
WORLD.

31:15.033 --> 31:17.400
>> I AM NINE YEARS OLD AT EVEN I

31:17.466 --> 31:17.766
UNDERSTAND THAT.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.466
>> AND IF YOU ARE SO CONCERNED

31:19.533 --> 31:20.900
ABOUT OUR FUTURE, MAYBE IT IS

31:20.966 --> 31:22.000
WORTH SPENDING NOW ON THINGS

31:22.066 --> 31:24.000
LIKE PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS

31:24.066 --> 31:24.700
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.333
>> THE CLOCK IS REALLY TAKING ON

31:26.400 --> 31:26.600
THAT ONE.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.800
>> IT'S NOT A CLOCK.

31:28.866 --> 31:30.833
>> PLEASE.

31:30.900 --> 31:31.100
>> PLEASE.

31:31.166 --> 31:32.533
>> BELIEVE US WHEN WE SAY, WE

31:32.600 --> 31:34.966
ARE NOT AS SCARED OF BEING BORN

31:35.033 --> 31:36.533
INTO DEBT AS WE ARE OF BEING

31:36.600 --> 31:38.266
BORN INTO A COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T

31:38.333 --> 31:38.766
INVEST INTO OUR FUTURE.

31:38.833 --> 31:40.466
>> AND WE ARE ALSO SCARED OF

THAT GUY DIGGING THE HOLE THE

31:41.433 --> 31:41.566
HOLE.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.233
>> I THINK THAT GOES WITHOUT

31:43.300 --> 31:43.500
SAYING.

31:43.566 --> 31:47.000
>> SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

31:47.066 --> 31:47.233
DEBT --

31:47.300 --> 31:49.733
>> YOUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN,

31:49.800 --> 31:52.600
AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN, ALL

31:52.666 --> 31:54.033
HAVE ONE MESSAGE FOR YOU.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.466
