01:36.090 --> 01:38.320
THIS PICTURE OF A HORSE TELLS
ME THAT DYLAN LIKES PICTURES

01:38.370 --> 01:39.917
AND ALSO THAT SHE LIKES HORSES.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.188
DAD SAID THAT THE FOUNDATION

01:41.230 --> 01:44.165
OF ANY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

01:44.200 --> 01:45.167
- DAD SAID THAT.
- YES.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.269
WHICH MEANS THAT, IN THIS CASE,

01:46.310 --> 01:48.301
I SHOULD PROBABLY EITHER
CHOOSE DRAWING OR HORSES.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.136
OKAY.
HONEY, I KNOW THAT YOU--

01:49.170 --> 01:50.444

I DON'T SEE
WHY I CAN'T DRIVE ANYWHERE.

MAYBE WE CAN EVEN GET THE
FIRM TO PICK IT UP,

03:53.850 --> 03:55.010
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE
DO WORK TOGETHER.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.641
YES, WE DO WORK TOGETHER.

I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.881
BABY, YOU'RE NOT ACTING
LIKE YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

05:06.920 --> 05:07.818

OKAY, WELL, I DEFINITELY
FEEL LIKE MYSELF.

A RIDE ON THE MOTORCYCLE.
VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHO I AM.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.204
OKAY. WELL, UNTIL YOU
SLOW DOWN AND TELL ME

05:14.240 --> 05:16.162
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU, YOU'RE
NOT RIDING THE MOTORCYCLE.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.202
REALLY?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.172
OTHER THAN WANTING
TO TAKE A RIDE

05:20.210 --> 05:21.484
ON A MOTORCYCLE THAT I OWN.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.657
WELL, I'M SORRY.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.486

WHY I CAN'T RIDE MY MOTORCYCLE.

05:24.530 --> 05:26.623

WE WERE SMALL

05:47.410 --> 05:50.959
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT

05:51.000 --> 05:54.584
AH-AH-AH

05:54.630 --> 05:57.451
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
YOU WOULD SMILE

- WE'RE EARLY?
- YEAH.

14:45.910 --> 14:46.945
I HAD MY EYES CLOSED.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.982
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE GONE THROUGH TIME.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.669
- YOU'RE A DAY EARLY.
- OH, MAN.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.950
I'LL HANG IN THE WAITING ROOM
WITH YOU, IF THAT'S--

14:51.990 --> 14:53.298
NO, NO, NO. COME ON.
THAT'S SILLY.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.717
IT'S YOUR DAY OF FREEDOM, SON.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.809
YOU GO AND HAVE SOME FUN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:57.860 --> 14:59.714
YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND
A LOT OF TIME...

14:59.760 --> 15:00.954
- WELL...
- IN THE STUPID WAITING ROOM.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.991
THIS IS MY DAY
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU, THOUGH.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.486
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- YOU SURE?

15:05.520 --> 15:06.657
- YEAH, I'M SURE.
- OKAY.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.897
I DID SEE A VINTAGE GUITAR SHOP
AROUND THE CORNER, SO--

15:08.940 --> 15:10.316
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

15:10.350 --> 15:12.102
I'LL BE ABLE TO WASTE
AN HOUR OR TWO THERE.

15:12.150 --> 15:14.038
YEAH,
YOU JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME,

15:14.080 --> 15:17.629
AND IF I'M NOT OUT IN AN HOUR,
YOU COME IN AND GET ME.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.661
- OKAY. THAT'S GOOD.
- OKAY.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.257
[car door closes]

15:22.640 --> 15:25.256
- HEY, MAX.
- HEY, BUD.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.508
WE JUST WANTED TO HAVE
A QUICK CONVERSATION WITH YOU

15:28.540 --> 15:30.599
ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT YOU LIKE.DYLAN.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.049
- YES, DYLAN.
- YEAH, DYLAN.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.374
WE JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

15:33.410 --> 15:36.061
ABOUT HOW THESE RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN YOUNG BOYS

15:36.100 --> 15:37.408
AND GIRLS WORK.MM-HMM.

15:37.450 --> 15:38.371
I KNOW HOW THEY WORK.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.648
- YOU KNOW HOW THEY WORK.
- OH, WELL, OKAY.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.555
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE,
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.103
YOUR DAD AND I HAVE BEEN
IN A RELATIONSHIP

15:43.140 --> 15:46.177
FOR SO LONG THAT WE ARE
PRACTICALLY EXPERTS AT IT,

15:46.220 --> 15:48.359
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT
ALONG THE WAY,

15:48.390 --> 15:50.005
SO WE WANTED
TO SHARE OUR KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.631
[Max]
NORMALLY TO BECOME
AN EXPERT IN SOMETHING,

15:51.670 --> 15:53.877
YOU HAVE TO NOT JUST
HAVE DONE IT FOR A LONG TIME

15:53.910 --> 15:55.150
BUT HAVE AN ADVANCED
DEGREE AS WELL.

15:55.190 --> 15:56.293
WELL, THEY DON'T HAND OUT
ADVANCED DEGREES

15:56.330 --> 15:57.604
IN RELATIONSHIPS, MAX,
BUT IF THEY DID...

15:57.640 --> 15:58.743
- THEY SHOULD.
- WE'D HAVE IT.

15:58.780 --> 15:59.508
I CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOUR
MOTHER AND I WOULD HAVE ONE.

15:59.540 --> 16:00.848
- WE'D HAVE IT FOR SURE.
- YEAH.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.027
WHAT'S YOUR WISDOM?

16:02.060 --> 16:02.981
OKAY. WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO START?
GREAT.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.477
UM, WELL, WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
ALONG THE WAY

16:06.510 --> 16:08.375
IS THAT SOMETIMES
IN RELATIONSHIPS,

16:08.410 --> 16:10.890
PEOPLE CAN LIKE EACH OTHER
AT DIFFERENT LEVELS.

16:10.930 --> 16:11.919
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.130
_ 50--
- SO, FOR EXAMPLE,

16:13.170 --> 16:15.138
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FIVE,
FIVE BEING HIGHEST,

16:15.180 --> 16:16.932
YOU MIGHT LIKE SOMEBODY
AT A FIVE, AND THEY MIGHT

16:16.970 --> 16:18.198
LIKE YOU BACK ONLY AT A TWO...

16:18.250 --> 16:20.309
- RIGHT.
- AND THAT'S OKAY. THEY JUST
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.489
THAT'S NORMAL.
IT'S A VERY NORMAL THING.

16:22.530 --> 16:23.485
WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS?

16:23.530 --> 16:24.974
FOR EACH OTHER?

16:25.010 --> 16:26.568
WELL, WE'RE BOTH AT A FIVE.FIVE.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.181
- RIGHT?
- YUP.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.017
AND THAT IS USUALLY HOW
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WORK.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.632
PEOPLE LIKE EACH OTHER
THE SAME AMOUNT.

16:32.680 --> 16:33.874
- MM-HMM.
- ROBUST FIVE.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.979
- IT HAS A BALANCE.
- YEAH.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.647
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
START OUT THAT WAY, THOUGH.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.840
I MEAN, THINGS COULD CHANGE.

16:38.890 --> 16:41.541
YOUR MOTHER, WHEN WE FIRST MET,
THOUGHT THAT I WAS A TWO,

16:41.580 --> 16:44.640
AND NOW I'M A FIVE.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.895
- SO THE NUMBERS CAN CHANGE?
- IT'S TRUE.

16:47.930 --> 16:49.750
- MM-MM.
- YEAH.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.244
WHAT?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.657
OKAY. SO THE SCALE
OF AFFECT ION IS FLUID?

16:53.700 --> 16:54.906
YEAH. IT IS FLUID.

16:54.940 --> 16:56.248
IT GETS A LITTLE STICKY,
BUT IT'S FLUID.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.042
- IT'S STICKY FLUID.
- IT FLUCTUATES.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.354
- REALLY?
- EVEN WITHIN--

16:59.390 --> 17:03.019
SO IT'S FLUID ENOUGH
FOR THE NUMBERS TO CHANGE.

17:03.050 --> 17:04.938
- YES.
- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.083
YOU'RE RIGHT, BUDDY.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.052
- IT'S THE TRUTH.
- IT IS THE TRUTH.

17:07.090 --> 17:10.059
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR DAD'S NUMBER

17:10.090 --> 17:13.162
IS UNDERGOING A CHANGE
AS WE SPEAK, RIGHT?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.815
ALL RIGHT, SO, MOM,
YOU'RE AGREEING NOW

17:14.860 --> 17:16.054
THAT NUMBERS CAN CHANGE.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.681
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.711
WHAT AM I AT RIGHT NOW?
4.95?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.478
- 3.5.
- 3.5. OKAY.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.794
BUT I'LL GET THAT BACK
UP TO A FIVE.

17:22.830 --> 17:23.797
SO YOU'RE STILL FRIENDS.

17:23.830 --> 17:25.752
YES.
WE'LL ALWAYS BE FRIENDS.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.247
[laughs]
GOOD FRIENDS.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.349
HUH.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.312
[dogs barking]
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.908
OH, IT'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.771
OKAY,
I CAN'T HELP
BUT POINT OUT

17:37.810 --> 17:40.119
THERE'S A VITAL PIECE
OF THIS PUZZLE MISSING.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.081
OH, YOU NOTICED THAT?
YEAH.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.564
- YEAH.
- WELL, YEAH.

17:42.610 --> 17:44.578
YES.I KNOW I DON'T HAVE A DOG...

17:44.610 --> 17:45.816
A LITTLE WEIRD,

17:45.850 --> 17:48.262
BUT I GREW UP WITH A BROWN
LAB AND A BORDER COLLIE,

17:48.300 --> 17:51.235
AND I JUST MISS
HAVING THEM AROUND, SO--

17:51.270 --> 17:52.498
YOU KNOW, BUT I LIVE
IN A TINY APARTMENT NOW,

17:52.550 --> 17:56.611
AND I DECIDED THAT
I WOULD CROWDSOURCE MY NEEDS.

17:56.660 --> 17:57.729
[chuckles]

17:57.760 --> 18:00.240
WOW, AND SO THE OWNERS
DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE,

18:00.280 --> 18:03.317
LIKE, BEING PERW
AND PLAYING WITH THEIR DOGS?

18:03.350 --> 18:06.046
NOT PERW.
NO, THEY DON'T EVEN NOTICE.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.559
HALF THE TIME,
THEY'RE ON A CELL PHONE, 50--

18:07.600 --> 18:08.453
OH, WOW.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.968
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WE GOT A POMERANIAN.

18:11.020 --> 18:11.975
- YEAH.
- NO PROBLEM.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.464
WE GOT A YELLOW LAB.OH.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.708
WE'VE GOT THOSE IN SPADES.
WE'VE GOT, UM, GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.399
- HMM.
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.193
- WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE MUNCH?
- AH, GOOD EYE.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.882
YOU'RE CUTE,
BUT YOU HAVE MY HEART.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.478
HEY THERE.YOU HAVE MY HEART, BESTIE.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.476
- HEY, LITTLE BUD. HELLO.
- DID YOU GET LEFT ALONE?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.657
HELLO.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.169
YOU'RE SWEET.OH, YOU'RE A LOVER.

18:32.210 --> 18:36.078
- HI, BUBBA. AWW.
- OH, YEAH.

18:36.110 --> 18:38.931
WHAT IF THERE WAS,
LIKE, AN APP FOR THIS?

18:38.970 --> 18:40.141
- LIKE--YEAH.
- YEAH.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.693
YOU COULD JUST, LIKE,
RENT DOG TIME.

18:41.740 --> 18:43.002
THAT'D BE COOL, RIGHT?

18:43.050 --> 18:44.358
I THINK THAT'S--
NO, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.119
I CAN DO ALL THE, UH,
BACKEND PROGRAMMING,

18:46.150 --> 18:48.254
AND YOU RUN THE COMPANY. HUH?ALL RIGHT.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.678
SPLIT THE PROFITS
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.291
WELL, 70/30.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.774
IT WAS MY IDEA.YEAH, GREAT IDEA.

18:52.820 --> 18:53.844
YEAH? DEAL?

18:53.890 --> 18:55.152
- YEAH.
- WE GOT HIM.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.292
- SHAKE ON IT.
- SUCKER.

18:56.340 --> 18:58.808
DO YOU WANT TO SHAKE ON IT?
NO? HMM.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.680
IT'S A GOOD GIRL.

19:03.070 --> 19:04.651
- SO, UH, DAD?
- YEAH, BUDDY?

19:04.690 --> 19:08.035
I WAS THINKING THAT THIS YEAR
I MIGHT WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.551
UM, OKAY.
WE CAN DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR MOM.

19:11.590 --> 19:14.354
ISN'T THAT GONNA CONFLICT
WITH BASEBALL, THOUGH?

19:14.390 --> 19:15.527
NO, NO. I KNOW.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.040
IT'S JUST THAT BASKETBALL HAS,
LIKE, A LOT MORE ACTION,

19:18.080 --> 19:21.186
AND CHRIS SAYS I'M A NATURAL.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.609
- CHRIS?
- YEAH. THAT'S MOM'S FRIEND.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.800
HE'S SO COOL, DAD.

19:24.850 --> 19:27.466
HE LET ME SIT ON HIS SHOULDERS,
SO I COULD MAKE A BASKET.

19:27.510 --> 19:29.296
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO SHORT OTHERWISE.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.717
HE ALSO SAYS I HAVE REALLY GOOD
HEIGHT AND COORDINATION...

19:31.750 --> 19:33.229
- YOU DO.
- AND IT'S GONNA TAKE OVER

19:33.270 --> 19:35.261
BASEBALL
AS OUR NEW NATIONAL SPORT.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.300
IT'S GONNA TAKE OVER
AS OUR NEW NATIONAL SPORT.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.612
OKAY, WELL,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:41.660 --> 19:44.174
BASKETBALL MAY BE
A BIGGER MONEY-MAKING OPERATION,

19:44.210 --> 19:47.589
BUT IT WILL NEVER REPLACE THE
SUBTLE BEAUTY THAT IS BASEBALL.

19:47.630 --> 19:49.416
OKAY? EVER.

19:49.460 --> 19:50.381
YOUR MOTHER'S FRIEND

19:50.430 --> 19:52.523
CLEARLY DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.014
THAT'S INSANE.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.358
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.493
CHRIS IS A LAWYER,
AND HE WORKS WITH MOM,

19:57.540 --> 20:00.088
SO HE'S PROBABLY PRETTY SMART.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.769
AND HE'S REALLY GOOD
AT BASKETBALL.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.845
WELL, BASKETBALL
ALSO LEADS TO ANKLE INJURIES

20:03.890 --> 20:05.369
AND FINGER SPRAINS,

20:05.410 --> 20:07.298
AND WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF YOUR MOTHER,

20:07.340 --> 20:09.547
MOST LAWYERS HAVE
QUESTIONABLE MORALS, OKAY?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.753
CAN WE JUST EAT OUR PIZZA HERE?

20:13.860 --> 20:16.511
LET'S JUST ENJOY OUR PIZZA.

20:28.710 --> 20:31.258
- OH. HEY, ASPERGER'S.
- HI, DYLAN.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.633
WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.079
OKAY. ABOUT WHAT?

20:35.130 --> 20:37.701
ABOUT THE NUMBER
AT WHICH YOU LIKE ME.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.787
I-I'M NOT FOLLOWING.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BACK UP.

20:40.820 --> 20:42.026
A LOT.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.573
UNDERSTOOD.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.576
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION
THAT THERE'S A BASIC SCALE

20:45.620 --> 20:49.135
OF AFFECT ION ON WHICH
ALL HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS OPERATE,

20:49.170 --> 20:50.239
AND WHEN A BOY
AND A GIRL FRATERNIZE,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.441
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE ON THAT SCALE

20:52.490 --> 20:54.515
THEIR FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER LIE.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.528
SOMEHOW I MISSED THIS PART
OF THE TALK, BUT I CAN DIG.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.142
WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?THE SCALE IS FROM ONE TO FIVE,

20:59.180 --> 21:00.522
WITH FIVE BEING
THE PEAK OF AFFECT ION

21:00.560 --> 21:03.324
AND ONE BEING FIRMLY
IN THE FRIEND ZONE.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.112
IN OUR CASE,
I LIKE YOU AT A FIVE.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.879
NOW, I NEED TO KNOW THE BEST
QUANTITATIVE REPRESENTATION

21:07.920 --> 21:10.912
OF YOUR FEELINGS FOR ME.

21:10.950 --> 21:15.671
UM, HOW ABOUT A TWO?

21:17.100 --> 21:18.021
I CAN WORK WITH A TWO.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.709
- YOU CAN?
- YES.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.399
TWO IS APPROXIMATELY
MY MOTHER'S NUMBER FOR MY FATHER

21:22.450 --> 21:24.793
WHEN THEY MET,
THOUGH THAT CHANGED OVER TIME.

21:24.830 --> 21:26.274
- I SEE.
- YES.

21:26.310 --> 21:28.790
IN ANY CASE, THE SCALE IS FLUID,
AND I IMAGINE I HAVE A DECADE--

21:28.830 --> 21:32.175
MAYBE MORE,
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.621
[school bell rings]

21:35.670 --> 21:37.285
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS NOW.

21:37.330 --> 21:40.185
I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER, DYLAN.

21:40.220 --> 21:41.733
HEY, ASPERGER'S.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.579
MAYBE A 2 1/2.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.269
- HI THERE.
- HEY.

22:00.310 --> 22:01.174
- EXCUSE ME.
- HEY, CAN I HELP YOU?

22:01.210 --> 22:03.314
HEY, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP MY FATHER.

22:03.350 --> 22:06.001
HE'S A REAL TALL, ORNERY GUY.
ZEEK BRAVERMAN?

22:06.040 --> 22:07.735
OF COURSE.

22:07.770 --> 22:09.761
HE'S ACTUALLY JUST WRAPPING UP
WITH ONE OF OUR THERAPISTS.

22:09.810 --> 22:10.765
OH, OKAY. GREAT.

22:10.810 --> 22:12.596
YOU CAN GO BACK THERE
IF YOU WANT.

22:12.640 --> 22:13.595
- RIGHT HERE?
- YEAH.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.356
- OH.
- JUST...

22:14.400 --> 22:15.662
THROUGH THIS DOOR
ON YOUR RIGHT.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.747
- OKAY. THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

22:32.420 --> 22:33.648
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
A LITTLE MORE ELEVATION?

22:33.690 --> 22:35.829
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BRING IT ON. HERE WE GO.

22:35.870 --> 22:36.859
OKAY.

22:36.900 --> 22:39.585
[treadmill beeping]

22:47.950 --> 22:49.702
OHH.

22:51.740 --> 22:52.536
YOU OKAY?

22:52.570 --> 22:54.629
YEAH. I'M FINE.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.079
MIGHT HAVE PUSHED YOU
JUST A BIT TOO MUCH.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.506
YEAH. YEAH.

22:57.540 --> 23:00.577
- YOU WANT SOME WATER?
- NO. IJUST...

23:07.900 --> 23:10.243
EVERYTHING OKAY?

A SMALL THING.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.709
NO, IT'S NOT A SMALL THING,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.570
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW.

26:57.610 --> 26:59.259
I'M JUST SORRY

27:33.370 --> 27:35.338
CAM PING IN YOSEMITE?

27:35.370 --> 27:37.952

GETTING ATTACKED BY A BEAR?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.331
YEAH.YOU REMEMBER THAT?

27:39.380 --> 27:41.268
AND WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT HOW TO DEFEND OURSELVES

27:41.310 --> 27:43.346
AGAINST A PREDATOR LIKE THAT?

27:43.380 --> 27:44.301
HE WAS GONNA USE KARATE.

27:44.350 --> 27:45.897
I WAS GONNA USE A CLUB,
AND FINALLY YOU GO,

27:45.940 --> 27:49.171
"WOULD YOU GUYS STOP
OBSESSING ABOUT THIS BEAR?"

27:49.210 --> 27:51.451
RIGHT. RIGHT."THERE ARE NO BEARS HERE."

27:51.490 --> 27:54.072
AND THEN ON CUE,

27:54.120 --> 27:56.873
THE BIGGEST BEAR IN YOSEMITE
COMES CHARGING OUT OF THE WOODS.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.013
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- YOU REMEMBER THAT?

27:58.050 --> 27:59.779
I MEAN,
IT ONLY SEEMED THAT BIG

27:59.810 --> 28:01.607
'CAUSE YOU WERE
ABOUT 2 FEET TALL.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.882
THAT THING WAS HUMONGOUS!
ADAM FROZE STIFF.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.364
I DROPPED TO THE GROUND

'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO PRETEND YOU'RE DEAD,

28:08.270 --> 28:11.091
AND THEN YOU IMMEDIATELY--

28:11.130 --> 28:12.688
TWO STEPS FORWARD,

28:12.720 --> 28:15.166
HANDS OVER HEAD,
"GET OUT OF HERE, BEAR!

28:15.210 --> 28:16.234

28:21.180 --> 28:22.488
OH, SURE.
THAT'S WHAT A MAN DOES.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.452
YOU DON'T DO THAT
WITH A GRIZZLY.

28:23.490 --> 28:24.934
OKAY.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.312
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU DO THAT WITH A GRIZZLY?

AN HOUR AGO.

28:51.550 --> 28:53.962
OH, WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
CAMILLE, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.560
NOTHING HAPPENED. I'M JUST
SITTING HERE TALKING TO CROSBY.

28:56.590 --> 28:58.000

THAT YOU HAVE FOUR PILLS

28:58.040 --> 28:59.962

AND BY THE WAY, CAMILLE,
I'M NOT YOUR PATIENT.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.774
YEAH, WELL,
SOMEONE HAS TO LOOK AFTER YOU

29:10.810 --> 29:12.630
BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T LOOK AFTER YOURSELF.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.329
[sighs]
LOOK.

29:14.370 --> 29:17.578
I'M SITTING HERE
HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MY SON,

29:17.610 --> 29:20.477

HOME, BUT NOT BEFORE THEN.

29:20.510 --> 29:22.239
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?OF COURSE.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.992
THOUGH YOU BOTH CLAIM TO BE
EXPERTS ON THE SUBJECT,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.509
I'M NOT SURE
THAT YOUR ADVICE IS ENOUGH

30:01.550 --> 30:03.825
TO BRING THAT UP TO A FIVE,

30:03.870 --> 30:04.962
SO I'VE CONSULTED
OUTSIDE SOURCES.

30:05.010 --> 30:05.829

30:22.640 --> 30:23.777
MAX, THESE ARE NOT REALLY
BOOKS ABOUT DATING.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.390
THEY'RE PICKUP BOOKS.
THEY'RE WRITTEN BY CON ARTISTS.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.600
OF COURSE THEY'RE BOOKS
ABOUT DATING.

30:26.650 --> 30:27.810
THIS ONE HAS "DATING"
IN THE TITLE.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.169
I KNOW IT DOES, BUT LET ME
JUST TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT, OKAY?

30:30.200 --> 30:31.167
YOU DON'T NEED

30:42.730 --> 30:44.209
HEY. THIS IS NOT MY FAULT.

30:44.250 --> 30:45.319
THAT IS GOOD.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.247
I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE HIM
TO GO GET THOSE BOOKS.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.736
IT IS YOUR FAULT.
YOU ARE ENCOURAGING HIM.

30:48.770 --> 30:49.691
NO, I'M NOT.HONEY, YOU'RE UNDERMINING...

30:49.740 --> 30:50.900

"I WAS ONCE A TWO.
I WAS ONCE A TWO."

30:53.470 --> 30:55.153
I WAS TRYING TO BE
ENCOURAGING, THAT WAS A--

30:55.190 --> 30:56.396
A STORY ABOUT US. YOU SAID...I WAS FLIRTING WITH YOU.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.509
- I WAS A TWO. I KNOW.
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

30:57.540 --> 30:58.984
I WAS TRYING TO GET HIM
TO UNDERSTAND THE GAME.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.499
I GET THAT, OKAY?

31:00.540 --> 31:02.644
BUT THIS GIRL
IS NOT GONNA LIKE HIM THAT WAY.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.612
- WHY NOT?
- PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

31:03.650 --> 31:05.618
- WHY? WHY NOT?
- I--BECAUSE.

31:05.650 --> 31:07.789
- BECAUSE WHY?
- [sighs]

31:07.830 --> 31:09.309
ADAM, REALLY?

31:09.350 --> 31:10.476
WHAT?
BECAUSE MAX
IS DIFFERENT?

31:10.520 --> 31:11.794
BECAUSE HE'S DIFFICULT?

31:11.830 --> 31:14.139
I KNOW HE IS, BUT SO ARE ALL THE
OTHER KIDS AT CHAMBERS ACADEMY.

31:14.180 --> 31:16.512
THEY'RE ALL--THEY'RE A POTPOURRI
OF FREAKS, LIKE DYLAN SAID.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.348
RIGHT?

31:20.390 --> 31:23.769
SO WHY NOT MAX?

31:23.810 --> 31:28.497
I NEED TO BELIEVE
THIS IS POSSIBLE.

31:28.540 --> 31:31.464
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

31:31.510 --> 31:34.980
BUT THOSE BOOKS ARE NOT--
HE CANNOT READ THOSE BOOKS.

31:35.030 --> 31:36.679
- THEY'RE GONE. RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY?

31:36.720 --> 31:37.948
- OKAY.
- PROMISE.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.093
I'LL TAKE 'EM AWAY RIGHT NOW.
I PROMISE YOU.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.062
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.897
I LOVE YOU. COME HERE.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.398
- I LOVE YOU TOO.
- ALL RIGHT.

31:44.450 --> 31:47.578
THIS GUY.

31:47.620 --> 31:49.099
ALL RIGHT, THIS WAY.

31:49.140 --> 31:52.007
- DOWN AT THE END OF THE HALL.
- SO... YOU LIVE HERE?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.860
YEAH. I LIVE HERE.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.116
WHY?

31:55.150 --> 31:59.143
UH, NO. JUST--
IS IT LESS SCARY DURING THE DAY?

31:59.190 --> 32:01.420
NO, IT'S PRETTY MUCH
EXACTLY THE SAME. WHAT?

32:01.470 --> 32:03.631
YOU DON'T THINK IT HAS
A SORT OF RUSTIC CHARM?

32:03.680 --> 32:05.432
IT'S GOT--
IT'S GOT SOMETHING.

32:05.470 --> 32:06.676
[laughs]

32:06.710 --> 32:10.339
GOD, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUCH
A PREPPY, LIKE, TECH GUY.

32:10.370 --> 32:12.361
- I AM NOT.
- YOU TOTALLY ARE.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.093
[laughs]
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.166
I'VE GOT MY SWEATER ON.

32:16.210 --> 32:18.166
YEAH.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.580
1--

32:23.630 --> 32:24.858
WHAT?

32:24.900 --> 32:28.722
I--UM, I JUST HAVE A QUESTION.

32:28.770 --> 32:29.737
SHOOT. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

32:29.770 --> 32:31.909
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT, UH,

32:31.950 --> 32:37.490
GOING OUT WITH SOMEBODY
THAT HAS SOME BAGGAGE?

32:37.540 --> 32:42.648
I THINK THAT MOST SMART,
UH, COMPLICATED,

32:42.680 --> 32:45.433
GORGEOUS PEOPLE HAVE IT.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.438
I-I THINK THAT'S
WHAT MAKES THEM INTERESTING.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.549
UM--

32:49.580 --> 32:51.719
IS THIS ABOUT YOU
NOT DRINKING AT DINNER?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.512
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS
WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH AA.

32:53.550 --> 32:55.108
- NO. I--NO, NO.
- I'M TOTALLY NOT PREJUDICED.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.869
I THINK IT'S LIKE
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.174
I WISH IT WAS THAT.
IT'S--

32:58.210 --> 33:02.453
I'M--I'M PREGNANT.

33:02.490 --> 33:03.661
WITH A BABY?

33:03.700 --> 33:05.907
THAT'S--THAT'S THE KIND
OF PREGNANT I AM, YES.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.828
WOW. UM, YOU DON'T LOOK IT.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.017
- OH.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.324
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- I'M SORRY.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.533
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SEEING ANYBODY.

33:12.570 --> 33:14.845
I'M--I'M TOTALLY SINGLE.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.745
THE FATHER IS NOT IN
THE PICTURE,

33:16.780 --> 33:19.886
SO I'M JUST GONNA DO IT ALONE.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.239
I-I RESPECT THAT.
THAT'S--

33:21.270 --> 33:23.477
THAN KS. YEAH, BUT--

33:23.510 --> 33:26.718
SO, I MEAN,
DO YOU STILL WANT TO COME IN,

33:26.760 --> 33:28.751
AND WE CAN HANG--
WE CAN HANG OUT?

33:28.790 --> 33:30.234
UH, YOU KNOW, I--
UH, CRAP.

33:30.280 --> 33:34.728
I DO, UM--I GOT A-A BUSY DAY
AT WORK TOMORROW.

33:34.770 --> 33:35.839
- MM-HMM.
- I TOTALLY, UH, FORGOT.

33:35.870 --> 33:36.973
IT'S, UH--
OKAY.

33:37.010 --> 33:37.931
WE'RE BETA-LAUNCHING
OUR NEW APP.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.004
IT'S JUST--IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.518
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET SOME SLEEP.

33:41.570 --> 33:43.356
YEAH.

33:48.090 --> 33:51.389
UH, I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU.
OKAY?

33:51.440 --> 33:53.601
YEAH, OKAY.

33:53.650 --> 33:56.437
GOOD NIGHT.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.469
BYE.

33:59.790 --> 34:02.350
[Crosby]
IT'S JUST BEEN
ONE CRAPPY THING AFTER ANOTHER.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.790
YOU KNOW, THESE ARTISTS,

34:03.830 --> 34:05.559
THEY'RE NOT ARTISTS.
THEY'RE BABIES.

34:05.590 --> 34:07.751
THEY'RE--ALL OF 'EM
ARE SELF-DESTRUCT IVE BABIES

34:07.800 --> 34:09.313
WITH ZERO CONSCIENCE.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.318
THEY JUST--THEY CAN'T WAIT
TO STAB YOU IN THE BACK.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.624
OLIVER ROME--
HE'S GONE.

34:12.670 --> 34:15.047
WE HAVE NO MONEY NOW COMING
INTO THE LUNCHEONETTE.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.254
SO, YOU KNOW,
ADAM AND I ARE SCRAMBLING,

34:18.290 --> 34:19.973
AND THEN WHEN I GET HOME,

34:20.020 --> 34:21.669
JASMINE IS LIKE,
"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

34:21.710 --> 34:24.508
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
BE OUT NEXT TIME?" YOU KNOW?

34:24.540 --> 34:26.223
"WHAT--
ARE YOU RIDING A MOTORCYCLE?"

34:26.270 --> 34:29.364
AND IT JUST DOESN'T END,
AND THEN JABBAR IS SO SWEET.

34:29.410 --> 34:30.570
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, BUT,

34:30.620 --> 34:32.645
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
I WALK IN THE DOOR,

34:32.690 --> 34:33.611
IT'S, "WE GOTTA GO
TO THE TRAMPOLINE THING.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.210
WE GOT TO GO TO SEE A MOVIE,
GO PLAY CATCH."

34:36.240 --> 34:38.162
I BARELY PLAY WITH HIM,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.098
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I FRACTURED
THESE TWO RIBS,

34:40.140 --> 34:42.381
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,
YOU KNOW,

34:42.420 --> 34:44.581
I-I GO TO THE DOCTOR,
AND THE GUY SAYS, "YOU KNOW,

34:44.630 --> 34:46.359
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE
AT YOUR AGE, TO HEAL,"

34:46.390 --> 34:48.244
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.AND I WAS LIKE, "AT MY AGE?"

34:48.290 --> 34:50.633
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
HOW DID YOU FRACTURE YOUR RIBS?

34:50.670 --> 34:53.662
I GOT IN A, UH,
SMALL MOTORCYCLE THING.

34:53.710 --> 34:57.157
YOU KNOW, LIKE, JUST A--
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

34:57.190 --> 34:59.226
DON'T--YOU DON'T
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.602
DON'T BE ON HER SIDE,

35:00.650 --> 35:04.097
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL I GOT LEI-T
IS THAT MOTORCYCLE.

35:04.130 --> 35:05.506
NO. I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE, THOUGH.

35:05.550 --> 35:06.858
YOU GOT A HOUSE FULL OF KIDS.

35:06.890 --> 35:09.165
YOU GOT NO MONEY COMING IN,

35:09.210 --> 35:13.340
AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THINGS,

35:13.380 --> 35:14.517
AND YOU'RE BEING PUSHED

35:14.560 --> 35:17.131
AND PULLED IN
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

35:17.180 --> 35:20.343
EXACTLY.

35:20.390 --> 35:22.358
WELL...

35:24.150 --> 35:26.766
YOU GOT TO--

35:28.050 --> 35:31.747
YOU GOT TO TRY TO ENJOY IT, SON,

35:31.780 --> 35:34.226
YOU KNOW?

35:34.270 --> 35:37.296
HAVE A LITTLE FUN,

35:37.340 --> 35:39.433
AND SCARE THE BEAR.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.230
IT JUST GOES BY FAST.

35:46.930 --> 35:49.376
FOREVER I WILL MOVE

35:49.420 --> 35:52.765
LIKE THE WORLD
THAT TURNS BENEATH ME

35:52.800 --> 35:56.486
AND WHEN I LOSE
MY DIRECTION

35:56.530 --> 35:58.498
I'LL LOOK UP TO THE SKY

36:03.090 --> 36:04.079
KNOCK, KNOCK.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.429
HI.HEY.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.574
TREAT DELIVERY. HA HA!
OKAY.

36:08.610 --> 36:09.577
LET'S SEE WHAT...THANK YOU.

36:09.610 --> 36:11.953

36:11.990 --> 36:13.958
VODKA. HUH?
IT'S THE NICE STUFF.

36:13.990 --> 36:15.309

36:15.340 --> 36:17.092
ENJOY THAT.

36:17.140 --> 36:19.688
OH, LOOK. SKULL BONG.
I'M READY TO LET GO.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.164
WHY ARE YOU GIVING
ME SKULL BONG?

36:21.210 --> 36:22.654
YOU'VE BEEN EYEING IT FOREVER,
AND NOW IT'S YOURS.

36:22.690 --> 36:24.317
CONGRATULATIONS.OKAY. THANK YOU.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.204
LET'S SEE.
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE HERE?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.241
OH. WHAT SKULL BONG
WOULD BE COMPLETE

36:28.280 --> 36:30.100
WITHOUT
A LITTLE MEDICAL-GRADE. ..

36:30.150 --> 36:31.287
- WOW.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.241
- THANK YOU.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.212

- HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS ON THAT.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.249
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT...
- WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE?

36:35.290 --> 36:36.496
OOH, LOOK.'CAUSE OF PREGNANCY?

36:36.530 --> 36:37.599
- CONDOMS!
- I DON'T WANT YOUR...

36:37.640 --> 36:38.538
BECAUSE NOBODY'S EVER
GONNA WANT TO TOUCH ME AGAIN.

36:38.570 --> 36:40.014
- AMBER--
- HERE YOU GO, ALL FOR YOU.

36:40.050 --> 36:41.017
I DON'T WANT YOUR CONDOMS.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.254
WELL, I CAN'T HAVE IT.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.188
I CAN'T HAVE ANY OF IT.
CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

36:44.230 --> 36:47.745
CAN'T EVEN HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP NOW.

36:47.790 --> 36:48.927
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

36:48.960 --> 36:52.748
I TOLD HIM ABOUT IT, AND...

36:52.790 --> 36:55.679
I THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW IT WENT.

36:55.730 --> 36:58.790
- YEAH.
- HE WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY.

36:58.830 --> 37:00.513
YEAH. I'LL CALL YOU."

37:00.560 --> 37:04.212
IT WAS, LIKE, TOO CLASSIC.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.138
I'M SORRY, AMBER.

37:06.180 --> 37:11.117
YOU KNOW, AMBER, IT'S
JUST A HARD THING, YOU KNOW?
IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR A MINUTE.

37:11.150 --> 37:13.459
- [sighs] YEAH. I KNOW.
- DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.707
IT'S JUST LIKE--IT'S JUST A BUMMER, YOU KNOW?

37:15.750 --> 37:16.978
LIKE...
YEAH.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.499
I KNEW THAT,

37:18.540 --> 37:20.292
LIKE, EVERYTHING WAS GONNA
BE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

37:20.340 --> 37:23.787
OBVIOUSLY, AND H DIDN'T KNOW
I--DERAILED.

37:23.820 --> 37:26.823
I MEAN, MY LIFE IS, LIKE,
COMPLETELY OVER AS I KNOW IT.

37:26.860 --> 37:31.479
OKAY. YOUR LIFE IS NOT OVER,
SERIOUSLY.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.339
YOU'RE GIVING ME ALL YOUR STUFF

37:32.380 --> 37:35.793
THAT YOU CAN HAVE BACK
IN A FEW MONTHS.

37:35.830 --> 37:37.309
YOU KNOW?

37:37.350 --> 37:38.214
IT'S NOT OVER.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.525
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW
IS A WEIRD TIME.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.734
AND YOU KIND OF DID IT
OUT OF ORDER,

37:43.770 --> 37:45.704
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
THAT YOUR LIFE'S OVER

37:45.740 --> 37:47.605
OR THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MEET ANYBODY

37:47.640 --> 37:51.360
OR NEVER HAVE
A BOYFRIEND AGAIN.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.914
SERIOUSLY.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.576
[Crosby]
OH, THE MINIVAN.

37:59.620 --> 38:00.757
- YUP. WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- YAY!

38:00.790 --> 38:02.234
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- WHERE'S THE BABIES?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.236
- AT HOME WITH MY MOTHER.
- OKAY.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.032
- CAREFUL.
- NO, NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.549
YOU KNOW, CROSBY,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT, JUST--

38:07.590 --> 38:10.070
DON'T LEAVE HIM WITH YOUR MOM.

38:10.110 --> 38:11.202
JASMINE, GEE, YOU KNOW,

38:11.250 --> 38:12.285
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.NO PROBLEM.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.693
HE WAS IN QUITE A STATE, SO--YEAH.

38:16.740 --> 38:20.324
- I AM FINE, THANK YOU!
- YOU'RE DRUNK.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.079
WELL, IT WAS JUST GONNA
BE ME AND CROS,

38:23.120 --> 38:24.257
YOU KNOW, HAVING A GOOD TALK,

38:24.300 --> 38:26.530
AND THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND,
SO...

38:26.580 --> 38:28.434
HMM.

38:28.470 --> 38:30.222
I'M, UH--I'M SORRY.

38:30.270 --> 38:31.885
I APOLOGIZE.IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

38:31.930 --> 38:34.239
IT'S NOT.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.443
[sighs]

38:36.480 --> 38:40.109
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.076
YEAH, ME TOO.

38:46.770 --> 38:47.862
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S A GREAT START.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.662
WE'VE GOT ART,
AND WE'VE GOT ANIMALS.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.328
THOSE ARE TWO GREAT TOPICS
TO START A CONVERSATION WITH.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.179
SO YOU'RE GOOD.

38:53.220 --> 38:54.357
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

38:54.400 --> 38:56.914
HOW SHE COULD LIKE HORSES
MORE THAN LIZARDS.

38:56.950 --> 38:58.941
HOW COME?

38:58.990 --> 39:00.298
HORSES ARE INFERIOR.

39:00.330 --> 39:03.811
OKAY, GOOD POINT, BUT, MAX,

39:03.850 --> 39:07.126
WOMEN ARE
MYSTERIOUS CREATURES.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.547
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS GONNA
LIKE EXACTLY WHAT YOU LIKE.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.969
THE BOOKS SAY THAT I SHOULD
HIGHLIGHT MY BEST QUALITIES.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.615
I THINK THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE?

39:13.660 --> 39:15.378
- I DON'T KNOW.
- NO?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.308
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, MOM?
- HEY.

39:17.350 --> 39:19.898
HI.
UM, WHAT DO I THINK?

39:19.940 --> 39:22.352
GOSH, THAT'S TOUGH
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY.

39:22.390 --> 39:23.482
- YEAH.
- THERE ARE SO MANY.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.350
HOW TO LIST THEM ALL?YOU'RE SMART.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.255
VERY SMART.

39:27.290 --> 39:28.496
ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
I KNOW.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.327
BRILLIANT, ACT UALLY.GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.079
MM-HMM.
A WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHER.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.189
YOU HAVE A GREAT EYE.

39:34.230 --> 39:36.505
- YOU'RE QUICK-WITTED.
- MM-HMM. THAT'S FOR SURE.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.428
UM, YOU ARE FUNNY.

39:38.470 --> 39:41.098
