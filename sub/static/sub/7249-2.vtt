00:02.503 --> 00:04.505
- Rory?
- Living room.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.673
I need your advice on something.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.012
What do you think? Not good?

00:12.095 --> 00:14.806
I'm not sure. Have you tried
the arts-and-leisure section?

00:14.890 --> 00:17.809
- I need you to be serious.
- You've got a newspaper on your head.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.770
- I know.
- And you need me to be serious?

00:19.853 --> 00:23.607
- I am trying to figure out veil lengths here.
- Sure.

00:24.024 --> 00:28.153
See, I kind of like this shoulder-length,
semi-poofy thing like this.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.697
But there's also a longer one
that may be interesting.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.865
Longer. Sure.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.201
- And then there's the full-on Diana.
- Right.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.787
Which is nice,
but it just might be a little...

00:36.870 --> 00:38.830
- You're reading me.
- Wait, don't move.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.040
Rory, stop it.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.251
This arms race thing
is really getting crazy.

00:42.334 --> 00:46.296
We're having a serious conversation about
my life's most important fashion decision.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.007
Why not go to a wedding dress place
and try a real veil on?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.509
- No way.
- Why?

00:50.592 --> 00:53.011
Too much taffeta.
Gives me cotillion flashbacks.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.932
Fine. Could you bend over so I can see
what the weather will be like tomorrow?

00:57.015 --> 01:00.394
Actually, I went in
one of those places yesterday.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.813
- You did? Which one?
- Marry Meme's.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.108
- I see we're going top of the line.
- It was horrible!

01:06.191 --> 01:09.361
You need to order your wedding dress
the first day of junior high.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.947
And if you haven't,
it's off the rack for you, missy.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.658
I tried on three dresses,
one of which gave me a rash.

01:14.741 --> 01:18.203
- Has anyone missed the bustle? I haven't.
- It was not that bad.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.707
They all looked wrong.
I'll be gross, and all the children will laugh.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.959
Max will realize
he's made a horrible mistake.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.879
And then people will walk away,
exactly as you're doing now.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.422
- Let's go.
- Where?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.882
Wedding dress shopping.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.633
- You're reading.
- I'm done.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.052
- You need to see Dean.
- He's playing softball.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.888
Your cure for cancer's almost finished.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.391
We'll find the perfect thing for you
to wear on your perfect wedding day.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.727
There will be no pointing, mocking,
or walking out.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.270
Why did you say 'pointing'?

01:43.353 --> 01:44.897
- Keys.
- Thank You.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:40.994 --> 02:44.540
Spending the summer at Chilton.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.501
If I don't improve my French grades,
I can kiss Vassar goodbye.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.171
You need to follow a study schedule.
I've told you this since second grade.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.923
Which worries both of us.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.300
- Maybe I won't go to college.
- You have to go.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.470
- Princess Grace didn't go.
- Thank you for the history lesson.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.347
- Take a pill.
- Marry rich.

03:00.931 --> 03:01.974
Hey.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.561
- You doing the summer school thing, too?
- Yeah.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.438
- What classes are you taking?
- Well, I...

03:09.398 --> 03:12.276
- What?
- You're not talking to me.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.777
I'm not?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.487
- Tristin?
- PJ Harvey?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.449
I'll look at the board, then you can
get back to your conversation.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.035
There's a Rebuilding Together thing
going on tomorrow.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.871
They fix up homes for the needy.

03:23.954 --> 03:27.708
It's a total easy gig
that looks great on your college transcript.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.336
- Sorry.
- Thanks, I'll think about it.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.505
- You wouldn't like it.
- 'Cause you'll be there?

03:33.589 --> 03:36.091
- Yes, I'll be there.
- I'll think about it.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.303
- You don't want to go.
- I'll see.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.888
You don't. It's not you.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.557
I have multiple personalities.
It might be one of me.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.895
It's hours of hammering, drilling, and dirt.
It's horrible, you'll hate it.

03:47.978 --> 03:52.691
How do you know that I don't spend hours
every week hammering and drilling?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.568
And dirt? I love dirt. I collect it.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.361
- You're hilarious.
- You're pathetic.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.030
Fine. Forget it.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.285
- Why don't you want me to go?
- I don't care if you go.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.163
You just spent a lot of energy
trying to convince me not to.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.540
- I'm late for class.
- Are you going to be mad...

04:08.582 --> 04:12.336
because you thought I was dating Tristin,
even though I wasn't, all your life?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.880
- I have commitments.
- You don't see how stupid that is?

04:14.922 --> 04:19.176
Sorry if you thought we had a deep
Thelma-and-Louise thing, but we didn't.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.055
- Have it your way but I'm going tomorrow.
- Fine, go. See if I care.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.682
- I will.
- Great. I hate summer!

04:34.608 --> 04:38.070
- Henry. Hi, nice to see you.
- You, too. What classes are you taking?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.697
Shakespeare, Physics,
Obscure Russian Poetry.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.117
Wow. I'm still trying to get through Trig.,
but third time's the charm.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.621
- I can help you if you want.
- I just may take you up on that.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.584
- Lane's fine.
- Good. I haven't talked to her in a while.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.045
- I called once.
- And?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.881
Her mother answered. She sounded angry.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.385
- No, that's just Mrs. Kim.
- I hung up, 12 times.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.763
On the 13th time,
she said she'd have the FBI trace the call...

05:04.805 --> 05:06.056
and have me thrown in prison.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.476
And though I know the punishment
for multiple hang-ups isn't prison...

05:09.560 --> 05:12.145
she sounded so capable
of doing real damage that I...

05:12.229 --> 05:13.438
Stopped calling?

05:13.522 --> 05:17.276
- Lane probably thinks I forgot about her.
- You want me to tell her you haven't?

05:17.359 --> 05:18.777
- That would be good.
- Done.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.446
Maybe you could give her my number
and she can call me.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.782
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.414
- Thank you. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.751
- What?
- Your trig. Notes.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.216
I think we may have
nailed down the problem.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.307
- 'Tomorrow I'm going to build a house. '
- Help build a house.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.934
Did you tell them
there's a light bulb in your closet...

05:51.018 --> 05:53.228
that burned out in '97
you still haven't changed?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.771
It's for charity.

05:55.189 --> 05:59.610
Don't those people have enough problems
without having you as a contractor?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.821
I'm sure there will be
real construction workers there.

06:02.905 --> 06:06.325
I will be assisting and helping out
those less fortunate than myself.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.995
I will be getting college credit,
and this is the end of this conversation.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.540
You're right, it's a good thing. Nice.
Keeps your halo shiny.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.875
Wait.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.503
When are you going to tell them?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.087
- Soon.
- When is soon?

06:19.171 --> 06:21.840
When the big hand hits the'S'
and the little hand 'oon. '

06:21.882 --> 06:24.510
You're getting married in three months.
Tell them now.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.262
- Ring the bell.
- The longer you wait, the harder it'll be.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.140
- Will you please ring the bell?
- Tell them before dinner.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.767
I will tell them when I'm ready.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.102
You have to accept that
because I'm the mother.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.855
In some cultures,
that means you have to do what I say.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.442
- If you don't tell them in two weeks, I will.
- Apparently not in this one.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.610
Good.

06:43.111 --> 06:47.241
We'll have to eat quickly. Your father
has an early flight tomorrow morning.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.534
Oh, I'm good.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.371
Rory's going to build a house tomorrow.
I thought it was a little weird, too.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.498
Walk as you babble, please.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.626
Somebody must have scratched the silver.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.339
Bring the bread out, too.
And pour the wine, please.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.841
Come on, hurry up.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.552
Yeah, because we don't want our salad
to get cold.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.220
Richard, dinner.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.180
- Mom.
- Eat.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.225
- Shouldn't we wait for Dad?
- Don't worry about him.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.395
He's the one with the early plane.
We don't have to go anywhere.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.730
We can stay all night, have a party...

07:18.772 --> 07:22.609
do some Jell-O shots,
play Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.653
Pass the bread.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.072
- Grandma, would you like...
- Yes, please.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.200
- You started.
- You have a 6:00 flight.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.872
- 6:00? Are you sure?
- What do you mean? Of course I'm sure.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.417
I checked it thrice with your secretary,
because I know she's an idiot...

07:38.500 --> 07:40.794
and all three times she told me 6:00.

07:40.878 --> 07:44.131
I wrote it down.
I have your ticket right out on the...

07:44.214 --> 07:46.258
- You're teasing me.
- Very possible.

07:46.341 --> 07:50.679
- I don't find that amusing, Richard.
- Exactly the point of teasing, Emily.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.848
- Hello, Lorelai.
- Hello, Father.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.850
- Rory.
- Grandpa.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.520
May I speak with you
for a moment, please?

07:59.855 --> 08:00.939
Okay.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.446
I wonder what that's all about.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.826
I guess we'll find out later, right?

08:15.829 --> 08:18.123
Hey, whatever happened to Xuxa?

08:19.958 --> 08:24.379
I thought we should touch base, you and I,
after that unfortunate incident last week.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.215
You already called me about that.

08:26.298 --> 08:31.011
I know, but I thought taking a moment
to once again say to you in person how...

08:31.428 --> 08:34.264
I know, and I appreciate it.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.017
- We've never had a fight.
- No.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.019
- This was our first one.
- Yes, it was.

08:39.102 --> 08:43.106
- And I must say, I didn't care for it.
- Neither did I.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.778
All right. We should go back inside.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.075
- We're fine now, right?
- We're fine.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.747
Buck up, Private.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.459
Wait. I wanted to give you something.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.503
- What?
- Come on.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.215
- Where are you guys going?
- We'll be right there.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.760
Well, hurry, you're missing
one hell of a conversation.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.348
- I'm really loving this salad dressing.
- I'm glad.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.016
- Lemony.
- Yes.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.563
Nothing like a nice salad
of lemony goodness.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.157
Mom.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.828
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.374
Well, it's like this.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.628
Could you put down your fork
for a second?

09:48.338 --> 09:49.673
Thank you.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.969
- Okay. You know Max?
- No, I don't.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.764
I know you don't know-him know him,
but you know of him, right?

09:57.848 --> 09:59.641
I've heard rumblings.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.442
Max and I have been serious
for quite a while now.

10:08.525 --> 10:12.321
He asked me to marry him and I said yes.
I'm getting married.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.118
Well, I think that's very nice.

10:18.202 --> 10:22.206
I certainly hope we'll be in town for it,
but if not, we'll send a nice gift.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.334
Now excuse me.
I'm going to check on the roast.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.466
- Are you okay?
- I'm perfect.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.927
- Really?
- I have hit a level of perfection...

10:34.968 --> 10:37.804
that's rarely seen
outside the Victoria's Secret catalog.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.181
I'm really sorry.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.309
Do not be sorry.
What happened tonight was inevitable.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.771
- I should have known not to tell Mom.
- You were trying to be nice.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.774
Telling her I was getting married
to a wonderful guy...

10:48.815 --> 10:50.692
who will love me and make me happy.

10:50.776 --> 10:53.237
That, and giving her my address
when I moved out.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.655
Two worst moves I made.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.824
Maybe she'll think about it
and call you and say she's sorry.

10:57.908 --> 11:02.037
'Mom, I'm getting married. 'I'm an idiot.
And as my mouth was opening...

11:02.120 --> 11:06.250
my mind was screaming,
'Don't do it. I mean it. You'll regret it. '

11:06.291 --> 11:08.502
- But did my mouth listen?
- No.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.130
And it opened, and the words came out,
and Emily was Emily...

11:12.214 --> 11:15.634
and my mouth was stunned,
and my mind said, 'I told you so. '

11:15.676 --> 11:19.263
Then my mouth got mad 'cause no mouth
likes to have its nose rubbed in it.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.976
Now my mind and mouth aren't talking.
It'll take weeks to get them together.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.936
Your mouth has a nose?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.482
- God, I'm crabby.
- You're hungry.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.901
- No, I'm not.
- You didn't eat any of your dinner.

11:32.985 --> 11:36.697
By the time I got my jaw off the ground,
Speed Racer had taken my plate.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.574
Luke will cheer you up, won't you?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.827
Sure, I'm great at spreading the joy.
What will you have?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.663
We'll have two coffees and a rant meal.
Extra cheese.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.789
- No.
- Why?

11:45.873 --> 11:49.626
I'm through ranting. I'll have
an acceptance meal and a side of fries.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.420
Please, you have not accepted this.

11:51.503 --> 11:54.923
I'm a grown woman. I do not need
my mother's blessing to be happy.

11:55.007 --> 11:58.635
- Must have been a good Oprah today.
- Just a little family drama. No biggie.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.846
- It's a little big.
- What's going on?

12:01.054 --> 12:05.184
I told my mother about me
getting married and it was slightly ugly.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.894
- Yep.
- Yep what?

12:06.977 --> 12:09.479
There's nothing like a wedding
to screw up a family.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.107
There's nothing like a family
to screw up a family.

12:12.191 --> 12:15.652
Something that's supposed to start nice.
Two people promising each other:

12:15.736 --> 12:17.905
'I love you forever.
I want to die when you die.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.699
'My life meant nothing
until you used my toothbrush. '

12:20.782 --> 12:22.910
- And then it starts.
- That's not exactly...

12:22.993 --> 12:26.121
Who do you invite?
Who sits where? Open bar? Yes or no?

12:26.205 --> 12:29.166
Auntie Juny doesn't eat chicken.
Uncle Momo's off his meds.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.335
- Juny and Momo?
- Just an example.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.878
Of a retired circus couple?

12:32.961 --> 12:36.006
After all that planning,
the reception will still be a disaster.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.175
No matter how carefully you plan...

12:38.217 --> 12:40.719
halfway through one of those
Bette Midler ballads...

12:40.761 --> 12:45.140
someone's drunk, or with someone's wife,
and a chicken Kiev lands on the cake.

12:45.224 --> 12:49.102
The Gettysburg Address was only
one page long, and that was about a war.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.813
- I call them like I see them.
- I've changed my order.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.399
I'll have the Luke's-giving-Lorelai-
a- migraine meal.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.026
- Blue cheese or ranch?
- Both.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.694
Coming right up.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.783
- Time?
- 8:30.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.035
- I'm late.
- Hold on. Coffee.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.788
- Thanks. I'll see you tonight.
- Wait. One sec.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.665
I have to be there in 20 minutes.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.626
- I made you something really cool.
- Can it wait till tonight?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.086
It won't be cool tonight.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.714
What do you mean?
What loses its cool factor in 12 hours?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.592
- This.
- What is that?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.470
- A hammer.
- It has feathers on it. Why?

13:23.554 --> 13:25.556
So the rhinestones and bows
won't feel lonely.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.850
- What do I do with it?
- Build a pretty house.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.185
How long will it take
to talk you out of giving it?

13:30.269 --> 13:32.312
- Forty minutes, an hour tops.
- Hand it over.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.773
- Call me when you get home. Be careful.
- I will.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.401
I mean it, Timmy.
No falling down the well.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.156
- You scared me.
- Sorry. Where you going?

13:43.240 --> 13:46.910
- I'm doing that Rebuilding Together thing.
- Right. I'll be fast.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.289
Here's my CDs, my posters, my books...

13:50.831 --> 13:53.500
three of my sweaters,
and one Viva Glam lipstick.

13:53.584 --> 13:57.087
I'll leave them here while I'm in Korea
because Mom will search my room.

13:57.171 --> 14:00.299
If she finds them, she'll throw them out
and spend the summer...

14:00.382 --> 14:02.801
- praying for my soul.
- I'll treat them like my own.

14:02.885 --> 14:06.388
Okay. Now, this is
the Lane Kim retrieval kit.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.100
It contains the phone number
of my cousins in Korea...

14:10.559 --> 14:13.729
a map of the house I'll be staying at,
a picture of me now...

14:13.812 --> 14:16.732
- and a mock-up of me in six months.
- You lost some weight.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.860
This is that name of that guy
at the American consulate...

14:19.943 --> 14:22.696
and several Korean phrases
written out phonetically:

14:22.779 --> 14:25.991
'Help,' 'Have you seen this girl?'
'Comes for money,' et cetera.

14:26.033 --> 14:30.496
- Still no return date info from the parents?
- Nope. But they did buy me a winter coat.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.082
- When are you going?
- Right after your mom's engagement...

14:34.625 --> 14:37.503
- Do you think she heard me?
- I don't think so.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.796
She'd be here grilling us for details
if she had.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.090
She wouldn't pretend,
to not kill the surprise?

14:42.174 --> 14:43.884
And risk clashing with the decor?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.470
- Right. Okay, I got to go.
- Hey, Henry...

14:47.137 --> 14:48.347
- Called him.
- And?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.058
He likes me. He's perfect.
I'll never see him again.

14:51.141 --> 14:55.187
You'll read about it in my novel:
A Connecticut Yankee in Pusan.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.862
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.406
- Where you going?
- I have to build a house.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.201
- Okay, so where you going?
- I'm serious.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.830
- You're going to build a house?
- It's for charity, and I'm late.

15:12.871 --> 15:13.997
Why don't you go in?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.792
You and Mom can continue
the Rory's-building-a-house routine.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.544
Then move on to 'Who's on First?'

15:18.585 --> 15:21.547
- How long are you going to be gone?
- I don't know. Why?

15:21.588 --> 15:25.551
I just thought we could hang today,
see a movie, get something to eat.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.595
We could go to a bookstore,
I'll watch you browse for some hours.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.848
I would love to, but I have to do this.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.391
- Blow it off.
- I can't.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.393
Did I mention the bookstore
for some hours?

15:34.476 --> 15:37.312
How about tonight?
We can get a pizza and go on Amazon.

15:37.396 --> 15:40.774
You'll be just as bored
watching me order books, I promise.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.860
- Deal.
- Good. I have to go.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.040
Excuse me.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.919
You're touching a man with a saw.
What are you thinking?

16:01.003 --> 16:03.213
- I'm sorry.
- I could have hurt myself.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.300
I could have hurt you.
A ton of hurt almost happened here.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.887
I really am sorry.
I've never been on a job site before.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.806
- It's nice.
- Okay, where you from?

16:12.890 --> 16:14.766
- Chilton. My name...
- Come on, Chilton.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.395
- No, it's Rory. Chilton's my school.
- You got a hammer?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.898
- Yes, sir.
- Where is it?

16:26.945 --> 16:30.115
- It's a real hammer underneath.
- That's a hammer?

16:30.699 --> 16:34.244
- It's just dressed up a little.
- You dressed up a hammer?

16:34.536 --> 16:37.581
No, my mother did. She does that.

16:37.623 --> 16:41.001
She takes things that aren't pretty,
and makes them pretty...

16:41.084 --> 16:42.503
like a hammer.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.881
One time, she made individual outfits
for my Liquid Paper bottles:

16:45.964 --> 16:48.800
A clown, a cowboy, a newscaster.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.596
- She's not insane. She just sounds it.
- Okay.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.681
Work here. Wear these.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.227
Don't look up.
Pay attention to your surroundings.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.230
The words 'duck' or 'run'
mean duck or run.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.650
Wear sunscreen, drink water,
get a button on the way out.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.486
That's it? That's the instructions?

17:07.528 --> 17:11.114
- But I've never done this before.
- Tomorrow you won't be able to say that.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.702
But people have to live in these houses.
They may have kids, pets, or breakables.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.704
You have trouble,
ask the person next to you.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.039
Look out!

17:20.499 --> 17:23.794
Hey, you learn fast.
I didn't even mention that one.

17:42.396 --> 17:43.730
This is my wall.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.649
- What?
- I've been working here.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.776
I put together this wall.
Go someplace else.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.445
- You put together this wall?
- Go help with cement.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.991
- That's very impressive.
- I've done it lots of times. No big deal.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.244
Louise, what did I just tell you?
Use a grub ax for that.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.537
Bite me.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.248
I never pictured you
as a Bob Vila kind of girl.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.793
Rebuilding Together is a prestigious
and respected organization.

18:04.877 --> 18:08.714
- I've been volunteering for them for years.
- Really? You just love the overalls?

18:08.755 --> 18:11.758
- I don't. Harvard does.
- What does that mean?

18:11.842 --> 18:15.262
When you apply to an Ivy League school,
you need more than good grades...

18:15.345 --> 18:16.847
and test scores to get you in.

18:16.889 --> 18:20.601
Everyone who applies to Harvard
has a perfect GPA and great test scores.

18:20.684 --> 18:25.189
It's the extras that put you over the top:
The clubs, charities, volunteering.

18:25.606 --> 18:29.193
- Oh, yeah. I know.
- I started volunteering in fourth grade.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.737
I handed out cookies
at the local children's hospital.

18:31.820 --> 18:36.533
By 10, I was leading my first study group.
The youngest person in the group was 12.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.786
I've been a camp counselor,
organized a senior literacy program...

18:39.870 --> 18:42.498
I worked a suicide hot line,
I manned a runaway center.

18:42.581 --> 18:45.626
Adopted dolphins, taught sign language,
trained Seeing Eye dogs.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.377
When did you have time for a life?

18:47.461 --> 18:49.630
I'll have a life
after I graduate from Harvard.

18:49.713 --> 18:54.092
If you'll excuse me, the drainage
on the south side of this place sucks.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.262
- Hi.
- Madeline.

18:57.596 --> 18:58.680
Bye.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.108
- You look good in dirt.
- Dean, hi.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.402
- So how was it?
- Long day.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.907
The day is over. Let's talk about the night.

19:16.949 --> 19:20.661
There's a 7:30 showing of Barbarella.
You can bring your mom's purse...

19:20.744 --> 19:24.456
the one with that monkey face,
and we'll sneak in some burgers...

19:24.540 --> 19:25.874
- What?
- I can't.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.876
- Get your mom's purse?
- I can't do anything.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.254
- Why not?
- Because I have a lot of planning to do.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.588
What planning?

19:31.672 --> 19:34.216
I'm 10 years behind
on my extracurriculars.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.551
What are you talking about?

19:35.634 --> 19:38.095
Paris has been accumulating them
since she could walk.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.640
She's done enough good deeds to bump
Mother Teresa off the Harvard list.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.016
Okay, I'm lost.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.143
I've been studying my butt off
my whole life...

19:45.227 --> 19:47.229
and I really thought that was enough.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.773
Then Paris tells me
that everyone makes good grades.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.692
It's the extras that put you over the top.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.319
I thought she was messing with me
like she always does...

19:54.403 --> 19:57.656
- but she's right. It makes total sense.
- What does?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.784
Good grades aren't enough.
I need to do things.

20:00.826 --> 20:04.454
I need to volunteer, work for charity,
help the blind, the orphans.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.498
I don't know, I just need to do something.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.667
Fine, what does this
have to do with tonight?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.002
I need to start now.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.629
You have to help the blind
and the orphans now?

20:12.713 --> 20:14.506
Didn't I tell you I was 10 years behind?

20:14.548 --> 20:16.508
You can't make up for 10 years
in one night.

20:16.550 --> 20:19.011
I know. I just need to get organized.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.846
Rory, it's summer.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.098
Summer's the time to hang out
and kick back.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.391
I can't hang out or kick back.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.686
I need to find a retarded kid
and teach him how to play softball.

20:27.728 --> 20:32.232
Oh, God! Listen to me.
I am under-qualified and horrible.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.651
- I thought we'd spend time together.
- We will.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.820
- When?
- Tomorrow, maybe.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.531
You were busy today,
so we made plans for tonight.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.117
- Now you're blowing me off again.
- I'm not doing that.

20:42.201 --> 20:45.204
- You'll go to summer school thrice a week.
- You knew about that.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.332
We've been apart for a while.
I figured you wanted time with me.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.625
This is about Harvard.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.669
Excuse me, it's about Harvard. I forgot.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.671
Okay, fine.

20:55.714 --> 20:59.009
You're mad because I want to be sure
that I get into a good college?

20:59.051 --> 21:02.054
I'm mad because
my girlfriend doesn't have time for me.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.889
Stop it. This is important.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.516
- And it can't wait for one night?
- No.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.768
- Fine.
- Why are you acting like this?

21:07.851 --> 21:09.269
- Like what?
- Like you're two?

21:09.353 --> 21:12.272
I'm not going to Harvard.
I couldn't care less about Harvard.

21:12.356 --> 21:13.649
I just wanted to hang with you.

21:13.732 --> 21:17.528
But apparently, since I'm two,
maybe I'll just grow out of it.

21:24.910 --> 21:28.872
I'm too tired to go out tonight, so I
won't trust my accessorizing instincts.

21:28.914 --> 21:29.998
Tell me what you think.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.209
- I have no wilderness skills.
- You hate the purse?

21:32.251 --> 21:35.295
How can I get into Harvard
if I have no wilderness skills?

21:35.379 --> 21:38.090
You'll have to give up
your dream of majoring in logging.

21:38.131 --> 21:41.218
I called the Fireflies.
Do they need troop leaders? Yes.

21:41.260 --> 21:46.014
'I'll be a troop leader. ' The only catch is
it's summer, camping season.

21:46.098 --> 21:49.560
I need wilderness skills.
Why did you never take me camping?

21:49.601 --> 21:52.688
I couldn't get you to step on wet grass
until you were three.

21:52.771 --> 21:55.232
If you'd taken me camping,
I'd have wilderness skills.

21:55.274 --> 21:57.985
I'll take you upstairs
and throw you out the window.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.070
If you can grab the tree,
I'll be your witness.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.614
I called the Sunnyside Home.
'Do they need volunteers?'

22:02.698 --> 22:05.367
They don't,
but they do need an accordion player...

22:05.450 --> 22:06.910
for their Friday night polka party.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.037
Why didn't I force you to learn
the accordion?

22:09.121 --> 22:13.750
The library was closed. They only have
12 books, so I'm not counting on that.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.546
If the tutoring program at Chilton
is still taking names, I can do that.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.424
- Honey, calm down.
- I'm not prepared. I will never catch up.

22:20.465 --> 22:24.178
You will catch up, but not in one night.
You've made your lists and calls.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.138
Why don't you relax,
call Dean to come over?

22:26.221 --> 22:28.140
- We're in a fight.
- Why?

22:28.223 --> 22:32.227
- Because you never took me camping.
- Oh, boy, I'm really sucking tonight.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.605
We were supposed to hang out,
I told him I couldn't.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.065
He got mad, and we're in a fight.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.319
Listen, why don't I cancel on Max tonight?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.529
I'll hang out with you,
we can make popcorn...

22:42.613 --> 22:45.491
reminisce about how I never forced you
to become a missionary.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.660
No, go. I'm fine.
I just need to focus on this.

22:48.744 --> 22:51.497
- I can help.
- No, I need to do this alone.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.499
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

22:54.875 --> 22:59.379
I'm not going to be home late.
Listen, I would reconsider calling Dean.

22:59.463 --> 23:03.425
It's not his fault that you're so fabulous
he can't think about anything else.

23:03.509 --> 23:06.428
He just sits in his room,
eating Froot Loops out of the box...

23:06.512 --> 23:08.555
saying your name over and over.

23:08.639 --> 23:12.476
- Time is ticking.
- 'Rory, I love you. I will not be ignored. '

23:12.518 --> 23:14.853
- Leave.
- I'll be home early. Bye.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.363
- You hate your dinner.
- No, I don't.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.656
You've hardly touched it.

23:25.697 --> 23:29.785
When somebody takes trouble
to make your entrée look like a hat...

23:29.868 --> 23:31.495
you hate to mess it up.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.413
- Is something wrong?
- No.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.999
You can tell me. That's what I'm here for.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.585
- I thought it was just for eye candy.
- That, too.

23:38.669 --> 23:40.671
I'm fine. It's just stuff.

23:41.505 --> 23:45.884
Rory's freaking out about not having
enough extracurricular things...

23:45.926 --> 23:47.719
to impress Harvard with.

23:47.803 --> 23:51.306
- I can help her with that.
- I'm sure she'd greatly appreciate it.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.725
- Is that all that's wrong?
- Yeah.

23:53.851 --> 23:58.021
It's just a lot of stuff
to think about for the wedding.

23:59.064 --> 24:01.733
I forgot to tell you.
I saw my parents today.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.278
They just wanted me to tell you
how thrilled they are.

24:04.361 --> 24:07.322
My mother cried twice.
She said you don't have to call her 'Mom. '

24:07.406 --> 24:09.575
- But you're welcome to if you want.
- Really?

24:09.658 --> 24:13.162
Then my father gave me a long talk
about marriage...

24:13.245 --> 24:16.665
- and the ways of making a wife happy.
- Dirty talk.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.584
Then they gave me this.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.713
- No, they did not.
- Yes, they did, too.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.632
Did you tell them that we're paying
for everything ourselves?

24:25.716 --> 24:26.717
I did.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.637
Sookie's doing the cake, the ceremony's
at my house, Patty's supplying chairs...

24:30.721 --> 24:31.722
$35?

24:31.763 --> 24:36.143
It's the first of four installments,
so we can't spend it all in one place.

24:36.226 --> 24:39.146
- That is so cute.
- They just want to be involved.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.858
That's really sweet. Can I... Thanks.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.694
My mother even offered you
her wedding dress.

24:45.777 --> 24:49.615
Since three of you could fit into that dress,
I took the liberty of declining it.

24:49.698 --> 24:50.949
Hope she wasn't insulted.

24:51.033 --> 24:54.328
No, I just told her
you were wearing your mother's dress.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.830
It doesn't matter whether you are or not.

24:56.914 --> 25:00.209
- She just wanted to offer something.
- Let's get dessert.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.002
- Are you okay?
- I just think it's great.

25:02.085 --> 25:06.548
It's great that your parents are so happy
and into everything.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.133
That must be nice to have that.

25:08.217 --> 25:12.012
Think of it this way: Now they're
your parents, too. You'll have that, also.

25:12.095 --> 25:16.266
Yes, I will think of it like that.
That is exactly how I will think of it.

25:16.308 --> 25:17.351
Good.

25:17.434 --> 25:20.812
Otherwise, I'd have to look at it like,
'Max has parents who love him...

25:20.896 --> 25:22.689
'and care about him, and I have parents. '

25:22.773 --> 25:25.651
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- I'm not upset.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.028
I can't get that one moment
out of my mind.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.614
'That's nice. I hope we're in town. '

25:30.822 --> 25:32.574
Who reacts like that?

25:32.825 --> 25:37.538
What sort of mind forms that reaction to:
'Hey, Mom, I'm getting married'?

25:37.621 --> 25:39.748
From all you've told me
about your parents...

25:39.832 --> 25:42.084
there's so much baggage
between you guys.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.253
You figure out a different way.

25:44.336 --> 25:48.173
You tap into compassion
or family obligation.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.634
- You don't react like that.
- I agree. It's wrong.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.679
You can't change who they are.
You won't get anywhere trying to.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.806
I don't want to talk
about my parents anymore.

25:55.848 --> 25:59.309
I don't want to speculate about them
or analyze them or think about them.

25:59.393 --> 26:02.187
- We should go.
- Come on, it's still early.

26:02.396 --> 26:05.691
We'll go someplace else.
Talk a little bit more?

26:06.275 --> 26:09.528
Yes. Absolutely. Sounds good.

26:12.197 --> 26:14.950
I'm sorry tonight brought up
these bad feelings for you.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.994
That's okay. Make a right.

26:17.077 --> 26:20.998
But I bet this was harder for your mother
than you think it is.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.001
Look what's happened to her
over the last year.

26:24.084 --> 26:27.754
She's getting back into your life,
and suddenly everything changes on her.

26:27.838 --> 26:30.340
Yeah, that's got to suck. Go right.

26:31.425 --> 26:34.261
Maybe once we get married,
things will settle down.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.889
You two will be able to work it out.
You never know.

26:36.972 --> 26:40.809
I might be able to help the situation.
Act as a buffer or so.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.937
That's a good thought. Pull in here.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.733
Lorelai, hold on.

26:49.151 --> 26:52.362
I know what's going on.
I got to tell you, it's not a good idea.

26:52.404 --> 26:53.822
This will take a second.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.200
You should wait until tomorrow.
Calm down a little.

26:56.241 --> 27:00.037
- Maybe you'll be more objective.
- You are not asleep. Come on.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.997
You are way too emotional for this.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.167
I'm just emotional enough.
If you like, you can wait in the car...

27:05.250 --> 27:08.086
because I really don't plan
on being here that long.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.171
What on earth...

27:09.254 --> 27:12.049
Hi, Mom.
Do you have a sec to chat? Super.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.011
- Lorelai, what is this?
- I just wanted to see how you were.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.263
- I'm fine.
- You are? Good.

27:18.347 --> 27:21.266
I'm glad that you're fine.
I, however, am not fine.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.977
We were about to go to bed.
We can do this in the morning.

27:24.061 --> 27:27.564
Actually, no. We can't do this
in the morning. We need to do it now.

27:27.648 --> 27:30.609
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk. I'm confused.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.985
- About what?
- About you.

27:32.069 --> 27:33.612
What about me confuses you?

27:33.695 --> 27:38.492
So many things. For example,
why can't you keep a maid in this house?

27:38.575 --> 27:41.245
A thousand women
must have gone through here...

27:41.286 --> 27:44.832
in the 32 years that I've been alive.
Not one of them could stick it out.

27:44.915 --> 27:46.500
This is what we need to discuss now?

27:46.583 --> 27:50.546
These are women from countries having
dictatorships, civil wars, death squads.

27:50.629 --> 27:52.214
All of that, they survived.

27:52.297 --> 27:56.176
Five minutes working for Emily Gilmore,
and people are begging for Castro.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.261
I'm going to bed now.

27:57.344 --> 28:01.014
Why is it that when your only daughter
tells you she is getting married...

28:01.098 --> 28:03.934
you can't muster up
even a little enthusiasm?

28:03.976 --> 28:07.563
Even a little fake enthusiasm?
Why don't you pretend that you care?

28:07.646 --> 28:11.400
This is the biggest thing to happen to me,
possibly for the rest of my life.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.901
You dismissed it, like I said:

28:12.985 --> 28:15.320
'I'm thinking of getting a Honda.
What do you think?'

28:15.404 --> 28:18.615
- You're obviously hysterical.
- Why don't you care?

28:18.824 --> 28:21.076
Why have you never cared?

28:21.160 --> 28:24.079
No matter what has happened to me
my entire life...

28:24.163 --> 28:27.082
you've never been happy for me.
And that hurts, Mom.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.001
- It really hurts.
- I'm not discussing this.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.629
Do you know how it felt for me
to tell you that I was getting married...

28:32.671 --> 28:34.673
and to have you just brush it off like that?

28:34.715 --> 28:37.384
- Do you know?
- No, I don't know!

28:37.509 --> 28:40.429
Possibly similar to finding out
from a complete stranger...

28:40.512 --> 28:44.266
my only daughter was getting married
and had told everyone else in the world...

28:44.349 --> 28:48.520
before she bothered to tell her mother!
Possibly it felt something like that.

28:48.604 --> 28:52.357
Now if you will excuse me,
it is late and I am going to bed.

29:09.958 --> 29:13.128
My parents would really like
to have lunch...

29:13.212 --> 29:17.132
with you and Mr. Gilmore sometime soon.

29:19.426 --> 29:21.011
Nice meeting you.

29:29.478 --> 29:32.105
- I don't care.
- I just need a quick opinion.

29:32.189 --> 29:36.151
It took me two seconds to tell you
I don't care. That's as quick as I get.

29:36.235 --> 29:39.446
This is Lorelai's engagement party.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

29:39.530 --> 29:42.032
- I want it to be perfect.
- I am working.

29:42.115 --> 29:44.868
- Just pick a cookie!
- I don't want to.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.578
Michel, for the rest of their lives...

29:46.662 --> 29:49.414
Lorelai and Max will think back
on their engagement party.

29:49.456 --> 29:52.793
They're going to talk about three things:
The friends who came...

29:52.876 --> 29:56.338
the special song they danced to,
and the cookies that they ate.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.715
Their world is very small, isn't it?

29:58.757 --> 30:00.884
Macaroons or chocolate praline?

30:00.926 --> 30:02.928
Go back to the cooking room.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.639
Not until you eat these
and tell me what you think.

30:05.722 --> 30:08.225
Sookie, I only eat 1,500 calories a day.

30:08.267 --> 30:11.478
If I eat that,
I cannot have my Boca Burger later.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.606
Hey, Sookie. Is there any coffee left?

30:14.690 --> 30:17.359
- I had a really lousy night.
- Oh, sorry.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.653
I've been so busy,
I didn't even think about it.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.613
That's okay. I'll make some myself.

30:21.697 --> 30:26.243
No, I'll make it! I want to make it!
Let me do it.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.078
I'll make the coffee.

30:28.162 --> 30:29.913
- Relax. You're busy.
- No, I'm not.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.416
Go back to the counter. MicheI's stealing.

30:37.421 --> 30:38.755
Oh, my God.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.759
- What is this?
- The dinner special.

30:42.801 --> 30:45.470
The dinner special
is a heart-shaped pastry...

30:45.554 --> 30:47.723
with 'Max and Lorelai' written on it?

30:47.806 --> 30:49.474
I couldn't find any good salmon.

30:49.558 --> 30:53.103
You're throwing me
a wedding shower, aren't you?

30:53.145 --> 30:56.356
- It was supposed to be a surprise.
- Oh, my God!

30:56.440 --> 31:00.986
- This is amazing, Sookie, even for you!
- Wait till you see the ice sculptures.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.863
- When is it?
- Tonight.

31:03.030 --> 31:06.116
So your yen to hit the bingo parlor
in Enfield was...

31:06.200 --> 31:07.409
A vicious lie.

31:07.493 --> 31:10.454
This is really incredible.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.873
Is there any pink icing left on the planet?

31:12.956 --> 31:15.959
The whole town is in on it.
It's going to be quite the affair.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.503
You'll be impressed...

31:17.586 --> 31:20.214
with the amount of people
that want to celebrate with you.

31:20.297 --> 31:21.507
- No.
- Right.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.509
I can't get over this.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.763
You didn't, by any chance,
invite my parents, did you?

31:27.846 --> 31:31.475
I did. At first, I was really torn,
because I know you have issues.

31:31.558 --> 31:35.395
But it is your wedding, and I assumed
you wanted them to be there.

31:35.687 --> 31:39.358
- Oh, no. Your mother told you.
- Sort of.

31:39.858 --> 31:44.154
I thought I mentioned
that it was a surprise. Maybe I didn't.

31:44.196 --> 31:47.825
That would be so typical of me.
The cat's already out of the bag.

31:47.908 --> 31:50.494
I'm stuffing imported chocolate squares
down my shirt...

31:50.536 --> 31:52.955
so you don't see me
walk into the kitchen with them.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.957
Did your mother mention
if they were coming?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.416
She never got back to me.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.378
- No, she's got a thing tonight.
- Too bad.

31:59.503 --> 32:02.923
- We can save her a piece of cake.
- That would be nice.

32:11.723 --> 32:16.186
Attention, guests,
the buffet line is clogging in Sector B.

32:16.270 --> 32:19.565
I repeat, Sector B is moving too slow.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.692
Keep it moving, people.

32:21.859 --> 32:23.861
Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.237
- How's it sound?
- Great.

32:25.320 --> 32:29.074
I'm trying to find a blend between
not too cliché-sounding traditional tunes...

32:29.158 --> 32:31.076
with outer-left-field, should-be standards.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.289
The Sinatra medley was great.
And skip anything else by The Damned.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.917
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.

32:39.001 --> 32:41.378
- What time do you leave?
- I have a 10:00 flight.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.338
Have I told you I'm going to miss you?

32:43.422 --> 32:45.257
- Write me, constantly.
- Every day.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.593
Cards and letters,
full of hope and 'see you soon. '

32:47.634 --> 32:50.137
I'll be tying yellow ribbons
around the old oak trees.

32:50.220 --> 32:51.638
I will be back for the wedding.

32:51.722 --> 32:54.057
- You better be.
- Just don't let her change the date.

32:54.099 --> 32:57.769
Won't happen. Max is teaching a summer
course at the University of Toronto.

32:57.853 --> 32:59.938
If you're back by summer's end,
it will be fine.

33:00.022 --> 33:02.024
- Don't say 'if. '
- Right.

33:04.902 --> 33:08.614
I don't know if you realize
that every gift so far has been for you.

33:09.573 --> 33:13.035
In this town, I am the queen.
You are simply my jester.

33:13.452 --> 33:15.579
A position I happily accept.

33:15.871 --> 33:19.708
Come on, then. How can you stand
to leave all this for two months?

33:19.791 --> 33:22.252
You think Toronto will make you
into an ice sculpture?

33:22.294 --> 33:24.379
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd come with me.

33:24.463 --> 33:26.965
- I have to work.
- Two months is a long time.

33:27.049 --> 33:28.258
I know.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.303
Will you still want me when I get back?

33:31.386 --> 33:33.430
I think there's a very good possibility...

33:33.472 --> 33:37.184
that I will be just as infatuated
with you then as I am now.

33:37.643 --> 33:39.645
- Maybe more.
- Maybe more.

33:47.444 --> 33:50.823
Come on, ladies. Hurry up.
Love waits for no one.

33:50.864 --> 33:54.827
Lucy, get off of Jenny's train.
All right, bouquets up.

33:54.868 --> 33:56.995
And music.

34:06.839 --> 34:09.174
How come you're not up there, Kirk?

34:09.257 --> 34:12.177
Oh, I don't tap anymore. Bum knees.

34:13.428 --> 34:17.056
I'm worried about this gazebo
holding up all those hoofers.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.893
They never did a trial run, like I requested.

34:19.976 --> 34:21.645
I think it's okay.

34:22.062 --> 34:23.605
The studs are definitely sound...

34:23.688 --> 34:26.233
the two-by-fours are
a nice Number 2 structural grade.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.025
Or better, possibly.

34:29.695 --> 34:31.697
I built a house yesterday.

34:32.531 --> 34:34.283
Oh, for Pete's sake.

34:34.616 --> 34:39.246
No tossing of the Jordan almonds.
I repeat, put the almonds down.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.668
This is quite a party.

34:45.502 --> 34:48.380
Elegant and understated,
just like my mother.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.301
So, how are you?

34:52.842 --> 34:54.887
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Me?

34:56.013 --> 34:58.182
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not.

34:58.265 --> 35:00.517
- I'm so sorry, Rory.
- I'm sorry, too.

35:00.559 --> 35:03.395
- I don't know what happened.
- We had a fight, that's all.

35:03.437 --> 35:06.523
- I've just missed you and...
- I missed you, too.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.484
I got jealous of Harvard, which is crazy...

35:09.568 --> 35:11.904
'cause I love the fact
that you're going to Harvard.

35:11.987 --> 35:15.908
You have to do something
that's going to help you get there...

35:17.034 --> 35:19.745
I don't even really understand it myself.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.288
I didn't help.

35:21.663 --> 35:24.958
- I was all wigged out when I got home.
- You had all the right to be.

35:25.042 --> 35:28.754
It's that when it comes to Harvard,
sometimes I get a little tunnel vision.

35:28.795 --> 35:32.382
- And it's getting closer...
- You do not have to explain.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.511
But I don't want you to feel unimportant,
because you're not.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.221
- I'm glad.
- I mean it.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.097
You could only be more important to me...

35:39.181 --> 35:41.391
if you had a Kit Kat
growing out of your head.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.894
I can't make promises, but I'll give it a try.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.687
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

35:45.771 --> 35:49.024
I'm not going to a fancy school.
I don't have that kind of pressure.

35:49.107 --> 35:51.485
I can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

35:51.568 --> 35:54.488
You could go to a fancy school
if you wanted to.

35:54.571 --> 35:57.115
- I don't think so.
- Why not? You're smart.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.493
- No, you're smart.
- You are, too.

35:59.618 --> 36:02.496
I could help you organize
your extracurricular activities...

36:02.579 --> 36:04.039
because I'm now an expert at it.

36:04.122 --> 36:06.959
- I don't...
- How are your wilderness skills?

36:07.292 --> 36:09.670
- What?
- Do you accept my apology?

36:09.753 --> 36:11.880
Yeah, I accept your apology.

36:29.481 --> 36:30.774
You okay?

36:35.487 --> 36:37.614
You know, I'll be right back.

36:38.490 --> 36:42.286
Only three treats per person.
No hogging of the treats.

36:42.327 --> 36:44.997
If caught with more than three treats
on a plate...

36:45.080 --> 36:48.375
you will be faced with possible expulsion
from said party.

36:48.458 --> 36:51.461
- Kirk, could I see that for a sec?
- Sure.

36:52.671 --> 36:53.839
Thanks.

37:06.894 --> 37:08.896
Why aren't you at your party?

37:08.979 --> 37:12.274
That's funny,
I was about to ask you the same thing.

37:12.482 --> 37:15.569
- I just got kind of busy here.
- Yes, I can see that.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.155
They keep making that ketchup
slower and slower.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.741
It's the Heinz family's little joke.

37:21.825 --> 37:23.535
It's really pretty crazy out there.

37:23.619 --> 37:26.038
- I can imagine.
- Lots of people all having fun.

37:26.079 --> 37:28.332
- Just the kind of thing you'd hate.
- Sounds awful.

37:28.373 --> 37:31.043
- You would be miserable.
- Yes, I would.

37:31.251 --> 37:35.005
In spite of all that, I was thinking,
and you don't have to...

37:35.297 --> 37:38.675
that maybe you could
pull yourself away for a second.

37:41.053 --> 37:45.474
Finish the ketchup tonight, but leave
the Worcestershire sauce for tomorrow.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.684
- I'll see how it goes.
- Okay.

37:50.062 --> 37:54.358
It's a big night for me tonight,
and it feels like you should be there.

37:56.151 --> 37:59.196
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your ketchup.

38:08.789 --> 38:12.501
- The macaroons are going like hot cakes.
- Yeah, everything's a big success.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.586
Look at all this. Isn't it beautiful?

38:14.670 --> 38:17.089
I know it's clichéd, but it is so romantic.

38:17.130 --> 38:20.467
It makes you giddy
in a sappy kind of way, doesn't it?

38:20.926 --> 38:23.637
- Sure, I guess.
- I hope they're happy.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.098
What am I saying?
How could they not be happy?

38:26.181 --> 38:29.726
They're in love. They have each other.
Everything's perfect!

38:29.768 --> 38:31.687
Okay, I get it.

38:32.062 --> 38:33.438
Jackson, what are you...

38:33.480 --> 38:35.732
You think I need a piano
to fall on my head?

38:35.774 --> 38:39.486
I don't think anyone
needs a piano to fall on their head.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.071
All the marriage talk...

38:41.113 --> 38:44.783
and the 'Jackson, you should see
Lorelai's ring. It's so beautiful. '

38:44.867 --> 38:48.787
- It is.
- I understand. I'm hip, okay?

38:48.871 --> 38:52.207
We've hit that point in our relationship
where the hints are starting...

38:52.291 --> 38:54.626
that will be followed by
the where-are-we-going talk.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.211
That'll only end in an ultimatum.

38:56.295 --> 38:59.840
- Suddenly all hell breaks loose!
- Okay, no more sugar for you.

38:59.965 --> 39:02.593
So I think I need to say this right now.

39:02.968 --> 39:06.221
- I'm not ready for marriage.
- Okay.

39:06.555 --> 39:09.057
However, I'd be willing to move in.

39:09.266 --> 39:12.102
- Move in where?
- Move in with you.

39:13.228 --> 39:16.815
- Jackson, you're hilarious.
- I am?

39:17.816 --> 39:21.028
'I'll move in with you. ' What a riot!

39:21.111 --> 39:23.447
- Why are you laughing?
- Your face.

39:23.489 --> 39:26.533
- God, you are good!
- I wasn't joking.

39:27.576 --> 39:29.536
Come on, let's go get some punch.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.747
I'm serious. I'm moving in.

39:32.456 --> 39:35.375
Jackson, stop. You're giving me a cramp.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.336
Sookie, get back here.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.882
Marina, the door, please.

41:11.388 --> 41:12.556
Thanks.

41:15.309 --> 41:16.560
Hey, Mom.

41:17.978 --> 41:21.273
I was in the neighborhood
because there's that wedding dress place.

41:21.356 --> 41:23.525
Elizabeth Taylor
bought one of her dresses there.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.777
I was trying to make a decision
about a veil.

41:25.861 --> 41:30.365
I thought you might have an opinion
about which one would look best on me...

41:31.116 --> 41:32.743
'cause you know me.

41:32.784 --> 41:36.622
I thought I'd stop by and ask you
which one you thought would be good.

41:36.705 --> 41:37.831
On me.

41:37.915 --> 41:39.958
So which one?

41:42.669 --> 41:46.006
You're quite capable
of choosing that yourself, Lorelai.

41:52.387 --> 41:53.680
I'm sorry.

41:54.139 --> 41:56.099
All right, you're sorry.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.854
I don't know how to tell you things, Mom.

42:02.648 --> 42:07.444
I don't know if you've noticed this or not,
but we don't communicate very well.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.280
When something good happens to me...

42:10.405 --> 42:13.325
I'm just afraid you're going to
make me feel bad about it.

42:13.408 --> 42:14.993
When something bad happens to me...

42:15.077 --> 42:18.497
I'm always afraid you'll say,
'I told you so. '

42:19.331 --> 42:22.751
I'm not sure if that's always fair.

42:22.918 --> 42:27.047
And I'm sure I share part of the blame
for this circle we get into.

42:28.257 --> 42:31.385
You think your words
don't have any effect on me.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.554
But they do.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.561
I just didn't want to feel bad about this.

42:41.103 --> 42:42.521
So I waited.

42:44.857 --> 42:47.442
And I really didn't mean to hurt you.

42:58.203 --> 43:01.206
I will let you get back to that letter there.

43:03.167 --> 43:05.752
Your head is much too big for a veil.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.841
You might consider a tiara.

43:15.721 --> 43:16.930
A tiara?

43:19.892 --> 43:21.602
That's what I wore.

43:26.732 --> 43:27.816
Okay.

43:29.818 --> 43:31.695
I'll think about that.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.081
