00:01.460 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.088 --> 00:07.675
- You weren't part of the Seer's prophecy.
- The Seer? Take me.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.510
<i>There.</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:12.722
- You must be Robin.
- She doesn't say much at all.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.474
- Her mind has been scattered.
- Fitz!

00:15.641 --> 00:18.936
- Well, the gang's all here except May.
- Except May. She was taken to the surface.

00:19.103 --> 00:21.355
- No!
- We escape via the trawler.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.190
- Escape to where?
- The surface.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.861
I'm not leaving with you guys. You told me
to use my powers to protect people.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.779
- I'm here if you need me.
- Me too.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.365
I hid a crate of S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.
Level three.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.452
You mean the level infested with aliens
that suck your blood?

00:34.744 --> 00:35.870
Hang on!

00:36.037 --> 00:37.413
<i>They have escaped.</i>

00:37.747 --> 00:39.540
Friends. On the surface.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.418
Where are we?

00:42.626 --> 00:45.921
I have waited such a long time
to see you again.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.358
Three more cities just went dark.
It's spreading too fast.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.903
The Lighthouse is still
200 miles out!

01:09.070 --> 01:12.198
Hey! You're not supposed to be here.
Where the hell is this girl's mother?

01:13.324 --> 01:14.700
Polly didn't make it this far.

01:24.919 --> 01:28.255
Robin, go back downstairs with the others.
It's not safe up here.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.802
- It's okay. We survive the crash.
- What cra...

01:36.305 --> 01:38.265
There's a gravity storm
heading right for us!

01:38.849 --> 01:40.059
Sit down! Buckle up!

01:44.939 --> 01:47.566
- There's something else I need...
- ...to remember.

01:55.574 --> 01:58.577
Sorry. What did you ask?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.456
How are you even here?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.961
I told you we'd survive the crash.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.670
A crash?

02:10.506 --> 02:11.632
I'm not sure I...

02:11.799 --> 02:14.343
Don't be put out if you can't follow
Robin's train of thought.

02:15.678 --> 02:19.014
It's like her life is a deck of cards
shuffled out of order.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.643
She's a seer all right,
but nowadays she can't separate

02:22.810 --> 02:24.270
past, present, and future.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.148
Samuel Voss.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.360
My apologies for the rough rescue,
but you got to act fast

02:31.527 --> 02:33.237
when gravity storms start kicking up.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.161
You're going back out?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.788
Yeah, my crew's gonna go out
and collect your friends.

02:42.955 --> 02:43.956
Wait.

02:44.123 --> 02:45.457
They made it to the surface?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.169
- How do you know?
- She told me.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.839
A decade ago.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.720
Sounds like them now.

03:01.724 --> 03:05.394
Don't worry. Robin told me
they survive this crash too.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.343
Love what they've done with the place.

03:43.766 --> 03:47.353
- Looks like, uh, you had a rough landing.
- Yeah, can't recommend the airline.

03:47.770 --> 03:51.982
Inexperienced pilot, lot of turbulence,
ran out of pretzels in coach.

03:54.485 --> 03:55.736
- May.
- Daisy.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.279
- Oh, my God.
- Daisy.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.031
It's good to see you.

04:00.658 --> 04:04.995
What? It's crazy the <i>Zephyr</i> ended up
on the last remaining chunk of Earth.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.748
Yeah. Must've been en route
to the Lighthouse before it crashed.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.084
Wonder if that means some of us
survived the end of the world?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.293
I doubt I made it.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.880
Ooh.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.423
- Medical, same place.
- Okay.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.132
It's good to see you.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.720
Glad we finally found some allies.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.932
You get any answers about who they are,
why they brought us here?

04:25.099 --> 04:27.935
Just more questions.
I have a lot to catch you up on.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.604
You don't understand.
They're not just dead.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.190
As far as everyone in the Lighthouse
was concerned, everybody

04:33.857 --> 04:35.818
that came up here was torn to scraps.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.363
But they're all still alive
and living in an actual airplane.

04:39.738 --> 04:43.575
Fitz, your design really withstood
the test of time.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.495
Woah, you designed this?

04:47.246 --> 04:48.372
Damn.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.499
Can't imagine
what it must've been like to fly.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.377
Technically, I'm the engineer,
I'm not the pilot.

04:53.877 --> 04:54.920
Oh.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.089
Yeah, well, that's still cool, I guess.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.300
Holy hell.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.136
Is that Deke Shaw?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.179
I'll be damned!

05:04.388 --> 05:07.558
Thought I was looking at your old man
20 years ago!

05:07.766 --> 05:08.934
Welcome.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.021
Oh my God, Voss.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.565
I should've known that
even the Roaches wouldn't touch you.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.860
Ha! Never thought I'd see you
tagging along with these folks.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.904
- It's a long story.
- Well, let's hear all about it, huh?

05:21.405 --> 05:23.991
You can tell me whether these guys
are the real deal or not.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.411
I'm surprised you're the only one of ours
to make the trip.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
And Virgil?

05:29.872 --> 05:31.999
The Roaches got him.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.209
I'm sorry.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.004
I've been playing catch-up ever since.

05:37.463 --> 05:38.839
I feel like he could've told me

05:39.006 --> 05:41.800
that he was exchanging messages
with my dead dad.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.219
- We didn't know who to trust.
- Clearly.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.431
So, where is he?

05:47.598 --> 05:50.142
Your dad was transmitting
from a radio tower a few days out.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.896
He's on his way back now,
but he is gonna be so happy to see you.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.565
- Is he?
- Oh, come on.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.901
Just, the way we left things,
it wasn't really...

05:59.068 --> 06:02.529
No, no, no, no, listen. He never held
any of that against you, all right?

06:03.072 --> 06:05.366
If anything is to blame,
it's the Lighthouse.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.576
That place did a number on all of us.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.586
<i>Are there any signs of life
on the downed trawler?</i>

06:21.131 --> 06:22.966
Must be some indication.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.599
If they fled to the surface,

06:31.100 --> 06:32.976
they may have the means to survive there.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.189
Destroyer of Worlds has proven...

06:38.023 --> 06:39.483
quite resourceful.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.697
You wanna go after her?

06:51.954 --> 06:52.955
If she's alive...

06:54.039 --> 06:56.291
reclaim our property. If not...

06:58.836 --> 07:01.171
at least, we'll have a trophy.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.259
All resources are at your disposal.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.386
While you're away,

07:07.803 --> 07:11.098
I'll focus on the human traitors
who aided the escape.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.186
We've been far too lenient
with those who serve us.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.607
Hmm.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.610
It's clear they require a...

07:24.319 --> 07:25.320
firmer hand.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.370
The disobedience must be punished.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.207
A renewal?

07:37.541 --> 07:38.542
No.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.628
Retribution.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.633
This ends today.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.644
Well, it's not that someone forgot
to pay the electric bill.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.647
- The Kreepers are playing games again.
- It feels more like an endgame.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.815
We need to move quickly,

08:01.899 --> 08:03.317
get to level three
where Fitz hid those weapons.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.236
Had to leave them on the level
with the giant space bugs, huh?

08:06.570 --> 08:08.197
- Have you seen those things?
- Nope.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.781
Still don't want to.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.825
The service tunnel's up ahead.

08:12.618 --> 08:13.702
It's our way up.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.542
Hey, Flint. This is your fault,
so you know!

08:21.627 --> 08:23.587
Hey, he didn't ask for any of this.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.923
They already cut the water.
Now the lights?

08:26.465 --> 08:28.592
They're punishing us for what you did.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.011
You should be down with the other Inhumans
where you belong!

08:32.221 --> 08:34.222
- Turn yourself in!
- You can't be here!

08:34.389 --> 08:35.390
Hey!

08:37.934 --> 08:39.477
You don't want to go down this road.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.238
<i>It all makes sense.</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:50.822
Robin is the reason we're here.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.117
She's the connection
between the two points in time.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.495
- This is our answer.
- The problem is, for her,

08:56.662 --> 08:58.914
those two times are indistinguishable.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.965
Well, the decades haven't made her
any easier to understand.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.050
It's like she's still a little girl.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.177
- Best not to crowd her.
- Yeah.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.487
Hello, Robin.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.032
We've had quite a journey to get to you.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.286
I was hoping you might tell us
why you brought us here.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.539
What are we supposed to do?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.083
I already told my mother.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.627
- Told her what?
- Everything.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.799
She's been in and out since I got here.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.343
I asked her why we were taken
from the diner.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.054
- And?
- She said it was the last time

09:56.305 --> 09:57.764
we were all seen together.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.183
That doesn't bode well.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.106
Phillip J. Coulson.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.944
He can bring all the pieces together.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.780
Pieces of what?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.123
This is the day it all ends.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.010
So the lady who sees the future says
that there isn't one. Super.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.221
Unfortunately, Robin's not much
for specifics. Anyone who has the answers

10:38.388 --> 10:40.849
is either unreliable, dead,
or wants us dead.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.184
So, status quo.

10:42.851 --> 10:47.397
Yeah! The homicidal blue bastards
are the most pressing issue.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.275
We made a pretty big splash
when we broke out of the Lighthouse.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.611
Hope Mack and Yo-Yo are holding their own.

10:52.778 --> 10:56.365
We're gonna come to blows with Kasius
soon. Only question is, who strikes first?

10:56.531 --> 10:58.450
Be nice to have Quake back with us
when that happens.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.619
Won't be quaking anything
with this thing on.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.914
Have Fitz and Simmons take a look.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.668
We'll keep working with Robin,
see what else shakes loose.

11:07.959 --> 11:08.960
Copy.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.894
I thought that I had a lot to process.
This must be

11:26.311 --> 11:27.437
blowing your mind.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.064
Yeah, a little.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.025
When you're a kid, you...

11:33.151 --> 11:36.071
You learn fast not to cross the Kreepers
because they'll send you to the surface,

11:36.238 --> 11:40.325
and up there, you die. But, hey,
turns out that everything's a lie.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.371
And people can survive up here,
and even that batty old lady made it.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.665
The one who sees through time?

11:47.249 --> 11:48.500
Probably should've mentioned that.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.129
Yeah, well, I thought she was crazy,
all right? And as I mentioned, dead.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.758
Back in the Lighthouse,

11:57.259 --> 11:59.970
Virgil used to bring her tea every day
and listen to her stories.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.267
That is until Kasius sent her
and my dad topside.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.437
Must have been sad to lose him.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.105
I'm...

12:10.772 --> 12:14.151
- sorry.
- No, I was too bitter to be sad.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.155
As far as I was concerned,
his loony theories got my mum killed.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.491
So he gets himself sent to the surface,
good riddance.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.203
Then you guys actually show up.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.373
Sucks when your parents get to say,
"I told you so."

12:31.209 --> 12:32.294
Yeah, he can say it.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.546
I just hope he says that he forgives me.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.883
Yeah, well, from my experience,
he probably wants the same thing.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.217
Experience?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.052
I didn't meet my dad
until I was in my 20's

12:41.136 --> 12:43.472
and all he really wanted to do
was make up for lost time.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.307
How'd that work out?

12:46.892 --> 12:49.186
Bit of a rocky start, but we...

12:50.562 --> 12:51.688
We got there.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.329
It's clear, for now.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.955
Let's go.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.169
It's not much further.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.130
- You sure?
- We made it off this floor alive before.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.216
- We'll do it again.
- And then what?

13:19.841 --> 13:22.093
Back to level ten,
where my friends wanna kill me?

13:23.845 --> 13:25.222
At least, the Roaches would be quick.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.066
Some of my friends never saw me the same
after I became an Inhuman,

13:36.566 --> 13:39.069
but I did nothing wrong
and neither did you.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.237
Hey!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.498
That's the stuff the Blues use
to keep the Vrellnexians away.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.124
What is he doing on this floor?

14:04.052 --> 14:05.136
I have no idea.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.932
But I'll feel a lot safer
with a real weapon in my hand.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.143
It feels good, being back on the <i>Zephyr.</i>

14:12.602 --> 14:14.104
Just wish it were in the right time.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.774
Yeah, well, I'd rather be here
than in that silent alien slave bunker.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.359
Point taken.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.696
Can you believe all these things survived
the apocalypse?

14:29.286 --> 14:32.581
Well, that looks like
an isochronous cyclotron, but...

14:32.747 --> 14:35.000
But with resonant superconducting coils.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.212
- That's strange.
- What do you think it does?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.007
It opened the portal
that brought you here.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.925
Take that top box right there.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.594
- Who built that...
- That thing controls the monolith?

14:45.677 --> 14:46.761
- ...and how does it work?
- Are you sure?

14:46.845 --> 14:48.930
Whoa, whoa. Deke warned me that
you scientists would be full of questions.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.100
Yes, and we are also partial to answers.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.102
Owen put it together.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
Deke's old man.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.982
Tried to explain it to me
a dozen times but,

14:59.441 --> 15:01.401
I don't think he can even
get his own head around it.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.362
- What, he didn't design it?
- No. Built it from some old schematics.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.949
That damn thing drew a year's
battery reserves when he fired it up.

15:08.366 --> 15:11.286
Didn't think it did anything
but sure enough, here you are.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.662
Heroes from the past.

15:14.915 --> 15:15.916
Oh, hey.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.959
Suppose I should say welcome home, huh?

15:25.675 --> 15:28.845
Maybe Deke's father will have
some more information we can use.

15:30.472 --> 15:34.684
But until then, we are on our own.

15:35.810 --> 15:36.895
I guess we are.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.410
What about Mack and Yo-Yo?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.204
Are they in danger?

15:55.246 --> 15:56.748
Is Kasius gonna attack?

15:59.501 --> 16:01.086
You think Fitz's new friend could help?

16:03.755 --> 16:04.756
Enoch.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.391
You spent some time with Robin
when she was a little girl.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.142
How did you get her to open up?

16:16.309 --> 16:19.354
For the most part,
she talked only to her mother,

16:19.896 --> 16:22.273
although she would, occasionally,
speak to me

16:22.649 --> 16:25.735
if I spent several days by her side.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.738
Patience is a Chronicom's greatest tool.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.074
And for those of us
with a limited life span?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.326
I apologise I cannot be of more help.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.622
Robin's gift is powerful
but it cannot be forced.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.751
- Sometimes all one can do is wait.
- That's not always an option.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.056
If we can't get Robin to talk,
we have to shift gears.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.559
- Our people in the Lighthouse need backup.
- Sure.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.269
But Daisy's still powerless.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.855
And I'm not winning any fights
with this hole in my leg.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.898
I don't know. You look pretty spry
for someone who was born

17:04.065 --> 17:05.358
over a hundred years ago.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.363
Hey, we always make it through somehow.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.949
- And if not...
- I'm not willing to lose anyone.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.992
- That's not all on you.
- Then what is?

17:15.993 --> 17:17.704
If I can't protect the team, what?

17:17.871 --> 17:21.165
I'm not a scientist and... I can't fly
a dead aircraft.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.542
You're the one I trust
to always have my back...

17:28.214 --> 17:30.550
Robin, I'm sorry.
We need more than a drawing.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.802
- We need help.
- What are you trying to tell us?

17:37.223 --> 17:40.894
The population is barely holding on,
and the water filtration system?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.979
Could go at any minute,
just like the solar-power arrays.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.648
And if we lose supplemental
power, we lose climate control,

17:45.815 --> 17:48.401
kicking off a series
of cascading failures.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.527
We're hanging by a thread.

17:49.652 --> 17:53.364
Then we hang on for as long as we can,
try to minimise the damage.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.325
But Robin said there's another way.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.494
Oh, not the girl's bloody time machine
again.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.496
It's impossible.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.832
You cannot change time. It's fixed.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.042
What if it's not?

18:04.459 --> 18:08.713
She's been right about everything else,
and for us to even have a chance,

18:08.963 --> 18:11.716
you and Simmons have
to design the machine.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.802
Okay. So we spend decades
on the schematics.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.179
What happens when we don't finish the job?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.474
Then we trust that someone else
will carry on after us.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.602
We have to give ourselves the chance.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.148
This is to remind you.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.070
Not today, Robin.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.282
You gave them everything you could.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.799
Hello, gorgeous.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.802
I don't get it. Doesn't the axe
make it harder to shoot?

18:55.969 --> 18:58.263
It makes it easier to chop heads off.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.431
I scouted the whole floor.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.642
I didn't see a single Virlnex...

19:03.393 --> 19:06.271
Verel... Verlo... I'm not even trying.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.064
The Roaches are gone.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.694
- Wait. Isn't that a good thing?
- No.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.530
'Cause it means the Blue Man Group
sent them somewhere else.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.665
Oh, no. The elevator.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.458
They released them downstairs.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.198
You're like a post-apocalyptic
Eagle Scout.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.033
Not sure what that means, but I like it.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.035
This must have taken you years to salvage.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.246
I've been wanting to take on the Blues
my entire life, so if you're here to help,

20:05.413 --> 20:07.999
you just might be the saviours
of humanity after all.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.546
That is,
if you're up to the challenge.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.174
Same goes for you and your team.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.724
Coulson.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.689
Last time I saw this,

20:32.315 --> 20:35.151
it sent us to the future.
How'd you get a piece of the monolith?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.195
We've held on to that for a long time.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.115
Became something of a symbol
for everyone who believed in the prophecy.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.450
It's more than a symbol.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.120
If we find more of these,
could give us a shot at going back home.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.289
Maybe Robin can tell us
where the rest are.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.541
Uh, yeah, I don't want to retch
in anyone's rations,

20:50.708 --> 20:52.710
but that's actually the only piece
we've ever seen.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.171
- The others are out there somewhere.
- Sure, but don't you think that we should

20:55.380 --> 20:57.215
focus on something more achievable, like,

20:57.632 --> 21:00.718
storming the Lighthouse, showing Kasius
the outside of an airlock, maybe?

21:00.885 --> 21:01.886
Absolutely.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.222
But Fitz and Simmons need to see this.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.153
That's not a happy face, Jemma.

21:19.362 --> 21:22.907
Yeah, the inhibitor's embedded itself
in the greater auricular nerve.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.246
- Okay.
- Removing it requires sophisticated tools

21:28.413 --> 21:30.123
and a trained neurosurgeon,
neither of which we have.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.251
Even if we did, the slightest error
could paralyse you from the neck down.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.628
Okay. So we leave it alone, then.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.506
We found a literal piece of the puzzle.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.842
The monolith, it's been fractured.

21:41.843 --> 21:42.969
Where'd you find that?

21:43.303 --> 21:44.554
Voss had it in his locker.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.390
The survivors who believed in the prophecy
held on to it for years.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.020
Here.

21:55.398 --> 21:56.816
What are we looking at?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.985
The shard fits into the machine
right here.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.863
Maybe that's how it was able to target
the monolith across time.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.072
This could be our way home.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.325
Yeah, but the shard alone isn't enough.
We need the whole monolith.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.869
It'd be great if Robin could help us
fill in the blanks here.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.455
Daisy, you knew her first.
Maybe you can get through to her.

22:10.747 --> 22:11.748
I can try.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.543
If she helps us get home,
maybe none of this ever happens.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.928
That fog could've driven every Roach
in the bunker down here.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.640
Hurry!

22:34.228 --> 22:36.731
Hey! Over here, you ugly bastard!

22:47.784 --> 22:49.035
Hey. You're okay.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.707
Shotgun axe.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.376
I get it now.

22:57.835 --> 22:58.836
Are you okay?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.964
The Roaches, they're everywhere.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.759
- I don't know how many.
- We need to take people to safety.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.305
- Then clear the floor, room by room.
- That'll take too long, even for you.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.017
I got another idea. Can you grab something
from upstairs, fast?

23:13.184 --> 23:14.644
- You got it, Turtle Man.
- Okay.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.438
For this to work, we need access
to the air-filtration system.

23:17.688 --> 23:18.731
I can take you there.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.400
But what are we gonna do?

23:23.528 --> 23:25.530
We're gonna take back this floor.

23:27.657 --> 23:31.411
Flint? Flint? Flint?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.204
Don't fall behind.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.498
- Come on.
- Get out of my way!

23:38.960 --> 23:40.336
Yo-Yo, what are you doing?

23:40.503 --> 23:42.088
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.256
You can't.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.716
Working with them is our only option.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.261
We need their power generators,
their water-filtration...

23:48.428 --> 23:50.972
Who cares about their offering?
It's not worth our freedom.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.350
- We both know they want to enslave us.
- Think about what Robin predicted,

23:54.517 --> 23:55.935
what will happen if you fight...

23:56.102 --> 23:59.814
She also predicted that we would
save the world and look at us now.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.108
- We need you with us.
- Flint.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.819
- Flint.
- Who is this us?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.864
We change our name,
we whisper in the shadows.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.699
Whatever happened to S.H.I.E.L.D. huh?

24:10.283 --> 24:11.617
We're doing the best we can.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.785
Flint...

24:13.536 --> 24:15.413
- Flint would understand...
- There is no Flint!

24:15.746 --> 24:20.168
Seriously, she needs to stop talking about
people who won't be born for 50 years.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.299
Robin, now is not the time.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.759
No. No one listens to me.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.012
- Mack will help Flint...
- Mack is gone!

24:31.596 --> 24:32.930
And he's never coming back.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.684
Please...

24:37.101 --> 24:38.102
have faith.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.729
I'm sorry, Melinda...

24:40.563 --> 24:42.356
but I stopped believing a long time ago.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.703
- Hey.
- What are they doing with the shard?

24:56.662 --> 24:57.955
Who, Coulson and May?

24:58.539 --> 25:01.959
Hell if I know but if you ask me, they got
their priorities way out of whack.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.628
No, that's not what I mean.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.631
That belonged to my mum.
Why doesn't my dad have it with him?

25:06.797 --> 25:08.925
After my mum died,
he always kept it close.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.427
- He wouldn't have left it behind.
- Don't overthink it, kid.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.221
It's pretty dangerous out there
in the wastelands.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.056
He probably just left it here
for safekeeping.

25:15.223 --> 25:19.185
No. Before the Blues exiled him,
I begged him for that stupid rock

25:19.352 --> 25:21.521
so I'd have something to remember her by,
and he said

25:21.687 --> 25:24.023
- that he couldn't trust me with it.
- You need to calm down.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.942
No, you need to stop lying to me.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.819
He wouldn't leave it in your locker.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.572
So what the hell did you do to my father?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.460
That box controls the entire floor.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.213
But the Blues shut the power off.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.344
Not a problem.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.765
Fitz knows how to pack for any occasion.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.731
Come on.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.735
Beautiful.

26:10.444 --> 26:13.281
And Yo-Yo got us plenty of these.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.995
You know that gas won't be enough
to kill the Roaches, right?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.122
Yeah, but it should be enough
to drive them into one room.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.999
Okay. Then what do we do?

26:23.624 --> 26:24.750
We don't do anything.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.555
Whoa.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.642
Dial it back a notch, Pebbles.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.488
Thank you, Daisy.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.873
Your dad would be glad
you still have that.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.924
I, um... I promised him
that I would protect you.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.178
And I'm sorry that I couldn't do more.

28:02.139 --> 28:06.602
Life in the Lighthouse and then up here,
it... It couldn't have been easy.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.022
My mother always kept me safe.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.945
There was something
I was supposed to tell her.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.948
Could you tell me?

28:19.907 --> 28:22.618
You tried to warn Coulson
about something. Was it...

28:23.577 --> 28:25.162
about the piece of the monolith?

28:27.873 --> 28:29.750
Robin, do... Do you know
where we can find the rest?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.003
Time, it's...

28:33.838 --> 28:35.214
It's... It's running out.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.216
Running out for what?

28:37.466 --> 28:39.510
What are we supposed to do?
What should we...

28:40.136 --> 28:42.638
I've had my fair share
of those conversations.

28:43.848 --> 28:47.143
She has important things to say, just
doesn't always say them at the right time.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.779
I'm trying to be patient with her
but it's hard when the...

28:59.572 --> 29:02.116
last thing she predicted
was our imminent doom.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.410
Let her rest.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.039
I might have something that'll give you
the answers you're looking for.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.212
That's interesting.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.091
This bit here... laser vibrometer.

29:19.884 --> 29:20.885
So, it...

29:21.051 --> 29:23.637
It measures the resonant frequencies
of the monolith piece.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.058
And locks onto the frequencies
in the monolith through space-time.

29:29.477 --> 29:31.270
Yes, you were right.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.022
I'll fill in the others.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.195
Jemma, did you lock the door?

29:40.905 --> 29:41.906
No.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.248
<i>Coulson?</i>

29:51.415 --> 29:52.416
<i>Help!</i>

29:53.292 --> 29:55.461
<i>Help! Coulson!</i>

29:56.212 --> 29:57.338
What's going on?

29:57.630 --> 29:58.631
<i>Coulson!</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.925
If you don't put up a fight,
you don't have to die.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.260
<i>Coulson, we're stuck in here!</i>

30:03.677 --> 30:06.931
Must be strange for you to see the world
like this after what happened.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.060
Look, I know everyone thinks
I'm this Destroyer of Worlds

30:11.227 --> 30:14.897
but I'm not that powerful. I couldn't
break a planet apart even if I wanted to.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.857
But somehow, it happened.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.026
Yeah, well, maybe the history books
got it wrong.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.653
Yeah.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.280
I'm sorry to say, but they didn't.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.784
We found this on the hard drive
on the <i>Zephyr.</i>

30:33.999 --> 30:37.253
That was the last time anyone
saw Daisy Johnson alive.

30:39.922 --> 30:40.965
And then?

30:41.799 --> 30:46.053
Well, by all accounts, the city
had been evacuated. No one there.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.348
After Quake walked in,
12.8 on the Richter scale,

30:49.807 --> 30:51.725
and the world cracked like an egg.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.523
- How could I...
- That's the question.

30:58.566 --> 31:02.570
But when you look at this moment and
all the suffering that took place after,

31:02.862 --> 31:04.738
you can't help but wonder...

31:05.739 --> 31:07.408
if it could've been prevented.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.627
It's too late to stop it.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.171
<i>Too late to stop it!</i>

31:22.172 --> 31:23.924
- There's so much blood.
- May...

31:24.800 --> 31:26.093
I've had it. I'm done.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.388
She can't control herself,
she can't stop seeing how people die,

31:29.555 --> 31:30.931
- keeps muttering about it.
- Hold on!

31:31.098 --> 31:32.808
She just described Jemma's death.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.396
Why don't you tell me
how I'm supposed to live with that?

31:37.730 --> 31:40.107
- I thought I already told you.
- You know she can't help it.

31:40.274 --> 31:43.986
She sees death like her father,
but she also sees a way out.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.071
That's why you designed the machine.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.240
Oh, you don't get it.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.413
Nothing that we do matters.

31:55.623 --> 31:58.250
- Because we can't change time.
- You don't know that!

31:58.417 --> 32:01.253
Of course I do! Because we've tried!

32:02.254 --> 32:05.424
For all I know, we've tried
a thousand times! Always ends the same.

32:06.926 --> 32:10.304
It's like a record that keeps on skipping
and we are repeating this loop

32:10.554 --> 32:13.891
- again and again and again!
- Fitz, take a breath!

32:15.559 --> 32:17.102
And every time, Jemma dies.

32:18.896 --> 32:19.897
They all die.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.192
Robin can't change it.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.945
Voss couldn't change it.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.616
Even Daisy couldn't change it.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.535
She saw the aftermath

32:34.036 --> 32:35.371
and she still destroyed the world.

32:36.705 --> 32:37.706
Daisy...

32:38.582 --> 32:39.583
Daisy!

32:40.334 --> 32:41.335
He has a knife.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.587
I'll make sure this never happens.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.841
We can tempt fate, or we can make sure
you never get back.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.975
What is this?

32:57.184 --> 32:59.061
It's your life or the lives of billions.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.078
Robin, stay back!

33:16.286 --> 33:17.830
This is the last day.

33:18.706 --> 33:20.457
I was hoping I could get to her
but if not...

33:22.251 --> 33:23.877
I can't have you give her the answers.

33:24.253 --> 33:26.422
I'm sorry. It's the only option
I have left.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.217
No, Robin!

33:41.103 --> 33:43.272
- Daisy.
- Go. I'll catch up.

33:48.277 --> 33:49.903
And here I thought we were getting along.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.674
Oh, no.

34:10.841 --> 34:13.844
Robin. You're okay. You're...

34:16.638 --> 34:17.806
We... We're gonna take care of you.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.685
Shh. You're okay, you're okay.
You're okay.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.067
Mum?

34:29.318 --> 34:30.319
I'm sorry.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.322
She's not here, but I'll stay with you.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.534
You always promised
you'd be here at the end.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.040
Mum?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.130
Mum?

34:53.342 --> 34:54.510
Everything all right, honey?

34:56.303 --> 34:57.471
Can't sleep.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.273
Come here.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.781
You want to talk about it?

35:16.156 --> 35:18.408
I wish I never got this power.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.704
It's a lot to have going on
in your head.

35:24.832 --> 35:25.916
Every night,

35:26.083 --> 35:29.336
I close my eyes and see people hurting...

35:30.462 --> 35:31.713
people dying.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.174
Even you.

35:34.758 --> 35:35.759
I know.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.636
It's okay.

35:38.846 --> 35:39.972
You're not afraid?

35:41.181 --> 35:42.182
A little.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.352
But you'll be there, by my side...

35:46.228 --> 35:48.063
just like I'll be there for you...

35:49.022 --> 35:50.023
in the end.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.360
I don't want to lose you too.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.656
We're special.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.366
Remember.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.952
We never have to say goodbye.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.711
I... I raised you?

36:11.336 --> 36:13.255
After my mother was gone...

36:14.214 --> 36:15.382
we lived together.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.468
Why me?

36:20.804 --> 36:23.307
You weren't afraid of what I could do.

36:25.225 --> 36:27.102
You always said I had a gift.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.022
And that...

36:32.065 --> 36:34.735
one day I could help save the world.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.905
<i>I'm supposed
to tell you something...</i>

36:38.322 --> 36:39.781
how you can get back home.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.118
That's right, but not today.
It's too early.

36:44.661 --> 36:47.372
You tell me when we're back on the <i>Zephyr,</i>

36:48.081 --> 36:49.082
years from now.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.585
But you won't remember me then.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.712
Then you remind me.

36:54.254 --> 36:57.716
Remind me that
I still have an important job to do.

36:58.842 --> 36:59.843
Remind me that...

37:00.260 --> 37:03.931
You're needed for more than you realise.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.935
Robin...

37:09.228 --> 37:12.356
Robin, what am I supposed to do?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.191
And when that day comes...

37:15.776 --> 37:17.945
you have to tell me how to get back.

37:19.863 --> 37:24.618
You tell me your vision of us
saving the world.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.122
But I've never seen that vision.

37:30.916 --> 37:31.917
You will.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.592
I'll stay here until you fall asleep,

37:41.134 --> 37:42.135
hm?

37:42.552 --> 37:43.553
Thanks, Mum.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.228
I know you can save the world.

37:53.522 --> 37:54.898
You were right.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.318
I've seen it.

37:59.903 --> 38:00.904
I just...

38:01.738 --> 38:03.782
haven't lived it yet.

38:08.203 --> 38:12.291
No. Robin, how do we get back?

38:21.758 --> 38:23.218
When you destroy the world,

38:24.052 --> 38:25.595
you remember this moment.

38:26.555 --> 38:28.181
Remember I tried to stop you.

38:37.607 --> 38:41.028
I think I can go back
to sleep now.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.208
This is what she meant...

38:57.461 --> 38:58.920
"The day it all ends."

39:05.135 --> 39:06.678
The Roaches are dead!

39:07.512 --> 39:08.638
You're safe now!

39:17.189 --> 39:18.190
Thank you.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.901
This fight's not over.

39:22.277 --> 39:25.572
If we want to survive, we can't let Kasius
pit us against each other anymore.

39:30.577 --> 39:31.578
All right.

39:32.621 --> 39:33.622
Who's first?

39:54.935 --> 39:56.019
I thought you'd be dead.

39:56.311 --> 39:59.481
Yeah, I guess Voss didn't want any more
of my family's blood on his hands.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.650
Your dad...

40:03.735 --> 40:06.029
Deke, I'm s... I'm so sorry.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.660
I just hope Robin can help you
find your answers.

40:13.203 --> 40:15.455
I think we're on our own.

40:42.816 --> 40:45.026
To me, Robin was a little girl
only days ago.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.406
We're not meant to see a life like this,
at its beginning and end.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.699
It's too much.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.869
Maybe it makes us appreciate
how short life really is.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.247
So, what now?

40:57.831 --> 41:00.500
We live on this crashed airplane
until the Kree or

41:01.084 --> 41:03.462
the Roaches or the gravity storms
finish us off.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.921
I think we can do better than that.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.715
Yeah, but at least that way,
I don't go back in time

41:06.840 --> 41:07.966
and quake the world apart.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.509
We do go back.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.137
Robin told me how.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.473
We can save everyone.

41:16.433 --> 41:17.893
Just one question, though.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.104
Who's Flint?

41:40.874 --> 41:42.083
They survived, then.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.670
I just pray the Destroyer of Worlds

41:45.879 --> 41:48.548
doesn't encounter the Vrellnexians
on the surface.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.468
Those creatures can be quite ravenous.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.145
<i>My orders?</i>

42:04.189 --> 42:05.398
Follow their trail.

42:06.566 --> 42:08.443
If you encounter
any of the human survivors,

42:08.652 --> 42:09.694
you know their weakness.

42:11.530 --> 42:12.864
Show no mercy.
