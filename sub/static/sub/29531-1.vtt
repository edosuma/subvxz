"A blanket of naps

00:51.585 --> 00:54.720
do movies always act like
mermaids breathe water?

00:54.722 --> 00:58.257
Obviously mermaids are mammals
because they look part human,

- What?

01:08.269 --> 01:12.404
Why do mermaids have hair
if they live in the water then?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.140
Why the mermaid has hair
could be perhaps

01:15.142 --> 01:18.477
indeed for the same reason
why the walrus has a mustache.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.181
Why does a walrus
have a mustache?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.625

02:12.666 --> 02:14.600

02:18.305 --> 02:21.740

definitely not sirens.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.627
Mermaids have been spotted
for a hundred years

02:41.629 --> 02:43.529

really do exist.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.737
Maybe they do.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.841
Maybe if we waited long enough,
say for a week or weeks on end,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.576
we could catch one surfacing,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.778
crawling out of the water
to have a look

02:59.780 --> 03:03.782
at the flickering lights
of the modern world.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.651
Maybe they're worth a fortune

03:05.653 --> 03:09.321
if you actually caught one
and cut off her tail.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.492
Why would you wanna
cut off a mermaid's--

03:13.494 --> 03:15.661
You don't know how strong
or resourceful a mermaid is.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.362
If she's survived this long,

03:17.364 --> 03:18.664
maybe she'd know
how to gnaw through the rope

03:18.666 --> 03:20.365
and release herself
from the boat.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.401
Logic and practicality
would dictate

03:22.403 --> 03:26.672
that one must maim
a mythical creature

03:26.674 --> 03:30.676
if one wants to transport
a mythical creature.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.377
Then how then?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.746
We take our fire ax

03:36.717 --> 03:39.284
tie the tail
to the end of the boat

03:39.286 --> 03:42.721
and drag it with us, underwater,
all the way back to shore,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.424
throw her human half into
the bloody chum hole,

03:45.426 --> 03:47.426

GHOST GIRL: Her legs don't work.

26:19.845 --> 26:20.911
Is she paralyzed?

26:21.847 --> 26:23.213
No wheelchair.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.149
Think they're
encouraging her to walk?

26:25.151 --> 26:27.318
Got it.
She's in denial, like you.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.853
Gonna steal a wheelchair.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.855
They don't lock
the storage closet.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.223
Even if it were locked,

26:33.225 --> 26:35.859
why not just walk
through the door?

26:35.861 --> 26:37.761
Do you ever wonder why you
can't seem to touch anyone,

26:37.763 --> 26:40.064
- but you can open cabinets?
- What are you talking about?

26:40.066 --> 26:41.932
Look, you were here
ten years ago,

26:41.934 --> 26:44.068
but you're certainly
not here now.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.937
You can't walk through walls,
through doors.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.239
You're not one of us.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.208

Can we not talk
about that, Alex?

29:25.364 --> 29:28.298
Guys, what is the wheelchair
doing in this room?

29:28.300 --> 29:32.503
Girls, where are the fish?
Don't we have more fish?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.240
SUSAN: And the admission
processing board

29:36.242 --> 29:37.441
have inquired about
the new patient.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.343
You haven't
filed anything yet.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.112
Just tell them we're working on
the paperwork, ran out of forms.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.114
You have oodles of messages
from the safety inspector

29:44.116 --> 29:45.849
wanting to seal off
that entrance downstairs.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.050
I'm working down there.

Turning the old asylum

There's a perfectly
good lock on the door.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.290
He says a locked door
isn't enough.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.126
Assholes just need something
to complain about.

Beyer Mental Health.
This is Susan.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.276
Okay, suit yourself.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.011
The men's swimming matches
are on.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.914
Sandra, maybe I should
bring her breakfast in here?

30:16.916 --> 30:19.149
- Men in Speedos!
- Okay.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.351
Men with big muscles!

30:21.353 --> 30:24.354
Don't bother replying.
It's only a mental home.

Look what I have got
for you, huh?

31:20.079 --> 31:24.081
Hey, don't these
look like toys?

31:25.184 --> 31:26.550
Pretty, huh?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.486
Very pretty.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.456
Do you like those?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.558
Look at this.
Would you like to...

31:35.494 --> 31:37.394
What do you think about him?

31:40.032 --> 31:42.566
You don't have to be afraid.

31:45.170 --> 31:48.171
Ooh, that one smells
like a fish tank.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.540
What do you think, huh?
You can touch it.

31:50.542 --> 31:54.044
You can play with this
if you wanted to.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.042
Oh, my God.

I'm gonna go get
some more blankets

34:07.379 --> 34:10.679
so we can make a fort
and stay safe, okay?

34:14.620 --> 34:16.686
- Dr. Miller.
- Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.302
She likes sitting here,
and she likes it dark.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.237
Why would she like it in here?
It smells like vomit.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.350
She's got something like seaweed
growing out of her scalp.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.553
Really? What do you mean?

34:49.554 --> 34:52.489
I don't know what it is.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.623
I'm not gonna cut it
until we do.

34:54.626 --> 34:58.161
She has clearly
been traumatized.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.397

35:19.351 --> 35:21.551
would you like to finish
what you were saying?

35:27.459 --> 35:30.227
- We should watch real cable.
- That asshole security guard...

35:30.229 --> 35:32.762
- We're all adults here.
- is a certifiable psychotic.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.298
We don't need cartoons from
the '40s to calm us down.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.767
- I saw him dragging Natasha...
- Where has Natasha been anyway?

35:37.769 --> 35:40.203
Okay, okay, I cannot hear

35:40.205 --> 35:42.672
when you are both speaking
at the same time.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.741
Now, come on.
First of all,

35:44.743 --> 35:49.412
we're here to get better,
not watch HBO, all right?

35:49.414 --> 35:52.549
Now, Linda--
Charlotte, put the book down.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.818
Thank you.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.487
Linda, would you like to finish
what you were saying?

35:57.489 --> 35:59.322
- Linda?
- [thunderclap]

35:59.324 --> 36:01.625
Would you like to finish
what you were saying?

36:01.627 --> 36:04.294
[girls cheering]

36:04.296 --> 36:05.762
Okay, okay.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.765
I know that they flicker,
but they never go off.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.838
[thunder rumbling]

36:14.840 --> 36:17.674
Okay, the lights flicker,
but they never go out.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.776
- [girls laugh]
- I'm freaking out.

36:19.778 --> 36:20.844
Who's hungry?

36:33.725 --> 36:35.725
Hey, can we all be quiet?

36:35.727 --> 36:38.495
She's trying to say something.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.864
- Hey, hey, hey, you guys...
- [thunder rumbling]

36:44.836 --> 36:47.470
I'm sorry. Her signing
is really cryptic.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.706
I can't understand
her hand articulation.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.775
Can you slow it down, please?

36:54.546 --> 36:55.879
She's saying
there's a girl in this room

36:55.881 --> 36:58.348
that none of us can see.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.288
I see her.
Tell her I can see her too.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.490
Ask her if she can see
Becky's eight-year-old twin

37:07.492 --> 37:09.292
standing by her, always
asking her for his blanket.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.861
What the fuck?
What the fuck? How--

37:11.863 --> 37:14.431
How the fuck did you know
that this was his blanket?

37:14.433 --> 37:16.766
She says she doesn't
belong here.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.569
Join the sorority, sister.
None of us belong here.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.570
Hey.
[snaps fingers]

37:20.572 --> 37:22.706
Come out of it.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.908
MILLER: Belongs to the water?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.544
Ask her why
she learned to sign.

37:32.417 --> 37:36.319
Pirates? Pirates?

37:36.321 --> 37:38.388
- Huh.
- Sign language pirates.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.856
Don't interrupt
the process, London.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.658
What do you care anyway,
Sandra?

37:41.660 --> 37:43.660
You're just gonna
leave us soon anyway.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.861
Who told you that?

37:44.863 --> 37:47.731
The doctoral trainees
always leave us.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.799
And your timecard's
punched enough holes

37:49.801 --> 37:52.335
to almost get you
a free sandwich.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.537
MILLER: She learned
to sign from--

37:54.539 --> 37:55.839
- Pirates.
- Pirates.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.474
Her and her species.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.742
But the men became--

37:58.744 --> 38:01.811
What are you saying?
What is this word?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.380
Aggressive?

38:03.382 --> 38:05.482
- Aggressive.
- Fucking pirates.

38:05.484 --> 38:10.754
And the men stole her species
from the sea generations ago.

38:10.756 --> 38:15.358
Thousands of girls
who were born on land

38:15.360 --> 38:17.727
are walking around...

38:17.729 --> 38:20.363
with no idea that...

38:20.365 --> 38:22.932
their genes go back to this...

38:22.934 --> 38:25.735
ocean resident?

38:25.737 --> 38:27.404
Like a fish?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.938
I don't understand.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.374
I don't know
what she's trying to say.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.544
Dr. Miller, I think
she thinks she's a mermaid.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.415
Why is she, um...

38:38.417 --> 38:41.551
bipedal there, Dr. Stiff?

38:42.954 --> 38:46.423
She's saying it happens...

38:46.425 --> 38:48.458
when she's forced to dry land,

38:48.460 --> 38:52.962
or when her tail is
removed from her body.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.999
They completely blend...

38:56.001 --> 38:59.002
into full humans.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.874
What is this?
What are you saying?

39:04.876 --> 39:06.943
- [grunting]
- What does this mean?

39:10.882 --> 39:12.615
You're dying.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.587
You're dying?

39:17.589 --> 39:20.557
Some who are like her
can survive on land,

39:20.559 --> 39:22.592
but many don't.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.730
She says she's gonna die

39:26.732 --> 39:30.433
if she doesn't get back
to the ocean soon.

39:30.435 --> 39:32.669
SANDRA: Okay, that's enough
for tonight, ladies.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.704
Everybody to your
sleeping quarters.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.005
Gonna give your medications
there tonight.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.842
Come on, everybody up.
We're done.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.644
Come on.
That's enough for tonight.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.113
Time to go.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.584
I don't want any horsing around
tonight either.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.786
Reyna, that means you too.

39:57.763 --> 39:58.928
Reyna!

39:58.930 --> 40:00.964
Fuck you, mermaid.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.732
Reyna!

40:02.734 --> 40:05.568
Sorry, Sandra!

40:05.570 --> 40:08.605
I'm ready for
my antipsychotic now!

40:08.607 --> 40:10.974
Can I request
that Dr. Miller...

40:10.976 --> 40:14.511
rectally administer the pill
into me tonight?

40:14.513 --> 40:15.745
Reyna!

40:15.747 --> 40:18.681
Please, nurse?
[laughs]

40:32.063 --> 40:34.764
I think I would be
from mermaids.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.767
I don't know. I just think
I'd be a mermaid.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.636
When I was a kid,
my mom used to have to drag me

40:39.638 --> 40:41.538
kicking and screaming from the
blow-up pool in the backyard.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.939
Therefore,
you must be a mermaid.

40:42.941 --> 40:46.009
- Shut up, Edith Post.
- Emily Post.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.044
All I'm saying is if one of us
was a fucking mermaid

40:48.046 --> 40:49.112
and didn't know it,

40:49.114 --> 40:50.513
I'd be the fucking mermaid.

40:50.515 --> 40:51.815
You definitely smell like one.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.817
What do you think, June?

40:53.819 --> 40:56.886
Better yet, let's ask
June's imaginary friend

40:56.888 --> 40:59.689
what she thinks
about all this.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.124
Huh, June?

41:07.098 --> 41:08.164
Hmm.

41:09.568 --> 41:10.967
That's what I thought.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.804
How about you put this
over your face

41:14.806 --> 41:16.105
so I can stop looking at it?

41:16.107 --> 41:17.540
[thunderclap]

41:17.542 --> 41:19.542
Put it over your head!

41:19.544 --> 41:22.078
Put it over
your fucking head!

41:22.080 --> 41:24.547
[whimpering]

41:24.549 --> 41:26.916
You're so fucking useless.
Are you happy, newbie?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.852
This is what happens
when you turn this place

41:28.854 --> 41:31.621
into a house of lies.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.056
Mermaid, my ass.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.725
Why don't you go to hell,
you little faker?

41:35.727 --> 41:37.060
I believe you.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.561
ALEX: I think I'm going
start telling people

41:38.563 --> 41:40.063
I'm actually a mermaid princess,
