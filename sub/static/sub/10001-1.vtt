02:24.974 --> 02:26.975
<i>Leonard...</i>

02:26.976 --> 02:29.312
<i>I love you,</i>

02:29.313 --> 02:32.007
<i>but I have
to go.</i>

02:32.009 --> 02:33.782
<i>I have to.</i>

02:52.302 --> 02:54.070
Oh!

02:54.071 --> 02:56.839
- Help!
- Hey! Hey, come here, man.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.841
You all right, man?

02:58.842 --> 03:00.776
- Should we call an ambulance?
- I don't know.

03:00.777 --> 03:02.745
Just get-- get him down.
Watch out, watch out!

03:02.746 --> 03:05.315
- He swallowed a lot of water.
- Sit him up!

03:05.316 --> 03:07.149
- Sit him up.
- Sit him up.

03:07.150 --> 03:08.851
- Go!
- Get him on his back.

03:08.852 --> 03:10.520
I'll try C.P.R.

03:12.356 --> 03:14.290
Stop!

03:14.291 --> 03:16.559
Are you all right?
You all right?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.661
What happened there?

03:19.996 --> 03:21.764
I fell in the water.

03:21.765 --> 03:23.932
No, he didn't!
I saw him.

03:23.933 --> 03:25.735
- He jumped.
- <i>Breathe, breathe.</i>

03:25.736 --> 03:27.270
What are you talking about?
I fell in the water.

03:27.271 --> 03:29.272
- <i>He just jumped in.</i>
- Come on, I gotta go!

03:29.273 --> 03:30.435
Just take it easy, man.
Where you going?

03:30.436 --> 03:30.973
Where you going?

03:30.974 --> 03:33.116
You gotta wait
for the cops, man.

03:33.117 --> 03:33.242
Hey!

03:33.243 --> 03:35.744
Hey, buddy, you even gonna thank
the guy who just saved your life?

03:35.745 --> 03:35.977
Huh?

03:35.978 --> 03:38.581
This guy right here--
he just saved your life.

03:39.983 --> 03:41.917
Oh.
Thank you.

03:42.986 --> 03:44.587
<i>Jesus.</i>

03:44.588 --> 03:46.722
<i>Hey, ain't that the guy</i>
<i>that works over at the, uh,</i>

03:46.723 --> 03:48.891
<i>the dry-cleaner</i>
<i>on Neptune Avenue?</i>

03:48.892 --> 03:52.294
<i>Maybe. But he doesn't look</i>
<i>too dry to me now.</i>

03:52.295 --> 03:54.429
<i>Douchebag.</i>

03:54.430 --> 03:56.399
<i>From New York 1 News,</i>

03:56.400 --> 03:58.968
<i>This is</i>
<i>"New York Tonight."</i>

03:58.969 --> 04:01.621
Hello?

04:01.622 --> 04:05.808
<i>I was beginning to think</i>
<i>you weren't going to make it.</i>

04:05.809 --> 04:08.961
<i>We're having guests</i>
<i>for dinner tonight.</i>

04:11.931 --> 04:14.266
What-- what happened?

04:14.267 --> 04:15.718
Huh?

04:15.719 --> 04:17.553
You're all wet.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.572
I fell
into the bay.

04:19.572 --> 04:21.807
It's cold-- Mom, come
on, stop. I'm fine.

04:21.808 --> 04:23.876
- You fell into the bay?
- It's not gonna happen again.

04:23.877 --> 04:26.011
- <i>Don't worry.</i>
- Leonard.

04:26.012 --> 04:28.364
It was an accident.
Can I change, please?

04:28.365 --> 04:29.732
Reuben!

04:29.733 --> 04:32.368
Mom, I'm fine!
I'm fine.

04:33.854 --> 04:35.738
What is the matter?

04:35.739 --> 04:38.374
I think he
tried again.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.425
He said he fell
in the bay.

04:45.382 --> 04:46.882
Leonard?

04:46.883 --> 04:50.686
<i>I think he forgot</i>
<i>his medication this morning.</i>

04:50.687 --> 04:52.738
<i>Leonard?</i>

04:52.739 --> 04:56.241
<i>Listen-- the man who wants</i>
<i>to buy our business</i>

04:56.242 --> 04:58.394
<i>is coming over tonight</i>
<i>with his family.</i>

04:58.395 --> 04:59.762
<i>Let's cancel that.</i>

04:59.763 --> 05:01.246
<i>No, they're almost here.</i>

05:01.247 --> 05:04.516
<i>Look, if he still has</i>
<i>this bipolar problem,</i>

05:04.517 --> 05:06.569
<i>he just has to</i>
<i>take his pills.</i>

05:06.570 --> 05:10.222
<i>It would be nice if</i>
<i>you joined us, okay?</i>

05:10.223 --> 05:12.041
<i>'Cause we want you</i>
<i>to join us.</i>

05:12.042 --> 05:13.842
Okay.

05:26.490 --> 05:29.091
Stupid stupid.

05:31.594 --> 05:33.428
Hi, how are you?
Oh, enjoy.

05:33.429 --> 05:34.847
Thank you!

05:34.848 --> 05:36.949
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:36.950 --> 05:39.485
I hope we're not late.
The directions were perfect.

05:39.486 --> 05:41.387
- It smells good.
- How you feeling?

05:41.388 --> 05:42.671
Good,
thank you.

05:42.672 --> 05:45.124
Good. You remember
my wife Carol.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.792
Hi, nice to
see you again.

05:46.793 --> 05:49.545
- <i>Thank you so much.</i>
- <i>And these are my kids--</i>

05:49.546 --> 05:51.597
<i>--David, my son.</i>

05:51.598 --> 05:53.882
<i>David.</i>
<i>My beautiful daughter Sandra.</i>

05:53.883 --> 05:57.119
<i>Oh thanks, Dad.</i>
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

05:57.120 --> 05:58.654
I have to go
to the bathroom.

05:58.655 --> 06:00.789
Down at the end
of the hallway.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.591
Hey hey, David,
what you got?

06:02.592 --> 06:05.661
Ohh!

06:05.662 --> 06:07.362
David,
say thank you.

06:07.363 --> 06:09.665
All right. Come inside.
Let me take your coats.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.667
Yeah, take
the coats.

06:11.668 --> 06:13.920
- This is a beautiful place.
- Yeah, you like it?

06:13.921 --> 06:16.055
It's so nostalgic--
it's like the place I grew up in.

06:16.056 --> 06:17.506
<i>Eat what you'd like. Okay.</i>

06:17.507 --> 06:20.126
- They're not baked.
- They taste like baked.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.644
Okay.

06:21.645 --> 06:25.097
My wife-- my princess--
is in the kitchen getting dinner ready.

06:25.098 --> 06:27.866
She'll be right out.
Anyway, help yourself.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.236
It's homemade hummus.
I did it.

06:30.237 --> 06:32.271
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Yeah.

06:32.272 --> 06:33.939
<i>Mmm, terrific! Terrific!</i>

06:33.940 --> 06:37.325
- <i>Ooh!</i>
- This is my son Leonard.

06:37.326 --> 06:39.194
- How you doing?
- Leonard? Michael Cohen.

06:39.195 --> 06:40.412
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

06:40.413 --> 06:41.864
My wife Carol,
my daughter Sandra.

06:41.865 --> 06:44.466
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.903
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:48.955 --> 06:50.156
<i>...Not from the Catskills.</i>

06:50.157 --> 06:51.774
<i>The Catskills that we</i>
<i>were talking about</i>

06:51.775 --> 06:53.776
<i>Is like</i>
<i>the slums of the Catskills.</i>

06:53.777 --> 06:57.379
- Which part? Which part?
- South Fallsburg, Loch Sheldrake.

06:57.380 --> 07:00.665
- Which is more west?
- Kiamesha. Kiamesha.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.334
<i>Is it more west than--</i>
- <i>We met at the Catskills.</i>

07:02.335 --> 07:04.520
<i>Just in time for the flies.</i>

07:04.521 --> 07:06.839
<i>You were very--</i>
- <i>And you were the prettiest one.</i>

07:06.840 --> 07:08.991
<i>I paid him to say that.</i>

07:08.992 --> 07:11.093
<i>35 years ago in</i>
<i>the Catskills.</i>

07:11.094 --> 07:12.211
<i>Please don't make me older.</i>

07:12.212 --> 07:15.247
- Hey, you like magic?
- Yeah.

07:15.248 --> 07:18.100
You ever heard of
the melting spoon?

07:18.101 --> 07:19.619
No.

07:19.620 --> 07:21.620
It's really cool.

07:21.621 --> 07:24.323
<i>Now they put so many</i>
<i>things in your path.</i>

07:24.324 --> 07:27.392
<i>I mean, all the inspections</i>
<i>and all of the licensing</i>

07:27.393 --> 07:30.462
<i>and all the-- the different</i>
<i>technology-- the machines.</i>

07:30.463 --> 07:32.197
<i>It's amazing you can</i>
<i>run a business.</i>

07:32.198 --> 07:34.333
You know, my son's been
working with me a little

07:34.334 --> 07:36.185
since he's been back.

07:36.186 --> 07:38.754
<i>You know?</i>
<i>I don't know how much he likes it, but...</i>

07:42.976 --> 07:44.893
<i>What about it, Lenny?</i>
<i>Do you like it?</i>

07:44.894 --> 07:46.595
<i>Do you like</i>
<i>the dry-cleaning business?</i>

07:46.596 --> 07:49.998
It's all right, you know?
It's good to help out the family.

07:49.999 --> 07:52.417
<i>He's a good photographer--</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

07:52.418 --> 07:54.286
<i>Really?</i>
- Yes. Yes yes.

07:54.287 --> 07:56.355
Yeah, I gave him
an old camera

07:56.356 --> 07:59.257
and now all he does--
he takes pictures all over the place.

07:59.258 --> 08:00.609
<i>Really?</i>

08:00.610 --> 08:02.177
<i>Beautiful black-and-white photos.</i>

08:02.178 --> 08:03.528
<i>Black and white.</i>
- Thanks, Mom.

08:03.529 --> 08:05.481
Yes, they are
beautiful photos.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.633
<i>Carol?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

08:07.634 --> 08:09.985
- Do you know what I'm thinking right--
- I know what you're thinking.

08:09.986 --> 08:11.637
<i>Listen, I have a little</i>
<i>proposition.</i>

08:11.638 --> 08:14.240
- Mmm, here we go.
- <i>No no.</i>

08:14.241 --> 08:16.592
We have-- we have
a bar mitzvah.

08:16.593 --> 08:18.827
David's bar mitzvah
is coming up next week.

08:18.828 --> 08:20.863
Oh, and of course
you're all invited.

08:20.864 --> 08:22.297
- You're invited.
- Oh, thank you.

08:22.298 --> 08:24.466
Oh, yeah.
- But we have a photographer,

08:24.467 --> 08:27.269
and he's taking the color shots and
he's taking the slides and the set-ups,

08:27.270 --> 08:29.821
but my wife,
the artistic one,

08:29.822 --> 08:31.207
she wants
the black and white.

08:31.208 --> 08:33.174
Yes, we do.
- Lenny?

08:33.176 --> 08:35.894
<i>Do you think you'd be interested
in doing something like that?</i>

08:35.895 --> 08:37.629
Oh, I don't know
about that.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.482
- I mean, I--
- <i>Why not?</i>

08:39.482 --> 08:41.283
I don't-- I don't really
do impromptu things.

08:41.284 --> 08:44.302
- I mean--
- Oh, try. You'll see what happens.

08:44.303 --> 08:46.471
<i>I'd love to see his stuff--</i>

08:46.472 --> 08:49.108
just check it out a little bit.
Do you think I could?

08:49.109 --> 08:50.909
Okay.

08:50.910 --> 08:52.928
I'll show you some.

08:52.929 --> 08:55.664
Leonard, why don't you show
Sandra your pictures?

08:55.665 --> 08:58.134
I don't know if--
you want to see that now?

08:58.135 --> 08:59.751
Yeah, I'd love
to see them.

08:59.752 --> 09:02.087
'Kay.
Come on.

09:02.088 --> 09:05.140
<i>I tell him all the time</i>
<i>but he gets angry at me.</i>

09:06.510 --> 09:08.727
- Report back.
- I'll call you for dessert.

09:08.728 --> 09:10.078
Eh?

09:12.799 --> 09:15.134
I wasn't expecting
visitors.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.504
Yeah, you've got
a lot of stuff in here.

09:19.505 --> 09:21.006
Yeah.

09:21.007 --> 09:23.375
I wasn't planning on being
home for so long, so...

09:23.376 --> 09:25.978
I gotta organize this place.
I don't know what the fuck.

09:25.979 --> 09:28.013
Oh, when--
when did you get back?

09:28.014 --> 09:30.015
Uh, about
four months ago.

09:30.016 --> 09:31.250
Mmm.

09:31.251 --> 09:33.702
What are we doing?
Oh, yeah-- pictures.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.604
You can sit down
if you want.

09:35.605 --> 09:37.105
Okay.

09:41.144 --> 09:43.912
- Let's see.
- You have a lot of DVDs.

09:43.913 --> 09:46.014
Yeah.
You like movies?

09:46.015 --> 09:47.449
Yeah, I love
movies.

09:47.450 --> 09:49.451
Yeah? Like what?
What do you like?

09:49.452 --> 09:52.504
Well, my favorite
movie is probably...

09:52.505 --> 09:54.056
"The Sound of Music."

09:54.057 --> 09:57.158
<i>Not because of</i>
<i>the film, really,</i>

09:57.159 --> 09:59.444
but because, you know,
whenever it's on,

09:59.445 --> 10:01.930
my family always watches it.
It's that kind of thing.

10:01.931 --> 10:04.466
No, that's a good movie.
It's underrated.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.535
Yeah.

10:06.536 --> 10:08.020
Can I look at these?

10:08.021 --> 10:10.022
Yeah, those are--
that's a good pile.

10:10.023 --> 10:12.757
<i>This is</i>
<i>the garbage pile.</i>

10:14.978 --> 10:17.262
Oh, these are nice.

10:17.263 --> 10:18.864
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

10:18.865 --> 10:20.599
<i>Yeah, this one I like.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

10:20.600 --> 10:22.634
This one's nice too.

10:22.635 --> 10:26.188
But you don't have any
people in them really.

10:26.189 --> 10:28.273
Yeah, well,
you know.

10:28.274 --> 10:30.876
People look at 'em-- they
don't have to be in 'em too.

10:30.877 --> 10:32.477
I like this one.

10:32.478 --> 10:35.114
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Gotta be in the moment.</i>

10:36.832 --> 10:39.534
So what--
what do you do?

10:39.535 --> 10:43.955
I work at Pfizer in
the city-- it's a drug company.

10:43.956 --> 10:46.425
Yeah, I know it well.

10:46.426 --> 10:49.628
I have some ones with
some people in it.

10:49.629 --> 10:51.397
I was just
going through these--

10:51.398 --> 10:55.383
who's-- who's that
in this photo here?

10:57.237 --> 11:01.473
Oh, that was-- I don't even
know what that's doing there.

11:01.474 --> 11:04.125
That's so weird.
That was my fiancée.

11:04.126 --> 11:06.829
- Your fiancée?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:06.830 --> 11:08.714
You were engaged.

11:08.715 --> 11:11.801
Yeah,
a couple years ago.

11:13.052 --> 11:15.688
She's gone, though.
She moved away.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.740
What happened?

11:18.741 --> 11:21.560
You know, um--

11:21.561 --> 11:24.246
We got these genetic tests
and we were both positive

11:24.247 --> 11:26.615
- for Tay-Sachs disease.
- Oh.

11:26.616 --> 11:30.251
It means if we ever had kids, they'd
be, like, dead after a year, so...

11:30.252 --> 11:31.737
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:31.738 --> 11:33.606
She didn't want to adopt

11:33.607 --> 11:36.441
and, well,
that was that.

11:36.442 --> 11:39.244
I'm so sorry.

11:39.245 --> 11:42.581
Mmm, probably for
the best.

11:42.582 --> 11:44.549
<i>Leonard? Sandra?</i>

11:44.550 --> 11:46.018
<i>Dessert's on the table.</i>

11:46.019 --> 11:48.370
Okay!

11:48.371 --> 11:51.090
You know, um...

11:51.091 --> 11:54.043
our parents
wanted us to meet.

11:56.796 --> 12:00.332
<i>Well, no, I have to</i>
<i>tell you the truth.</i>

12:00.333 --> 12:03.285
Actually, I wanted
to meet you.

12:06.272 --> 12:08.590
Yeah?

12:08.591 --> 12:10.242
Yeah.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.528
I saw you at
your parents' store

12:12.529 --> 12:14.462
and I just...

12:14.463 --> 12:18.133
You were asking
your mother to dance with you.

12:18.134 --> 12:20.285
<i>It was</i>
<i>very cute.</i>

12:21.871 --> 12:24.223
Sounds like something
I would do.

12:24.224 --> 12:27.125
<i>You two, dessert's on the table.</i>

12:27.126 --> 12:29.310
Yeah, we heard you
the first time!

12:31.748 --> 12:33.582
Sorry.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.484
She's really serious
about her desserts.

12:37.203 --> 12:39.871
We should probably go.
She's...

12:39.872 --> 12:42.374
gonna have an aneurysm.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.376
- We'll hang out after.
- Okay.

12:44.377 --> 12:47.146
Um, yeah. Okay.
I'm just gonna put this away.

13:22.349 --> 13:24.350
<i>Leonard?</i>

13:24.351 --> 13:26.718
Stop horsing around.

13:29.839 --> 13:32.140
Three deliveries--
one right near here

13:32.141 --> 13:34.676
and the other two
are in Sheepshead Bay.

13:34.677 --> 13:35.744
Okay.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.780
And don't lose
the clothes again.

13:37.781 --> 13:41.783
- You're gonna put us out of business.
- God willing.

14:20.239 --> 14:23.742
<i>We'll only be here</i>
<i>for a few months.</i>

14:23.743 --> 14:25.611
- <i>Hey, don't walk away.</i>
- <i>Don't fucking touch me.</i>

14:25.612 --> 14:27.613
- <i>Hey hey, where are you going?</i>
- <i>Get your fucking hands off me.</i>

14:27.614 --> 14:29.998
<i>Don't walk away from me!</i>
<i>Michelle!</i>

14:31.551 --> 14:34.536
<i>Get the fuck</i>
<i>back up here!</i>

14:34.537 --> 14:37.355
<i>Do not</i>
<i>disrespect me!</i>

14:38.974 --> 14:41.092
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:41.093 --> 14:42.711
<i>You're such</i>
<i>a spoiled brat!</i>

14:42.712 --> 14:44.496
Sorry.

14:44.497 --> 14:47.599
- For what?
- <i>You still think you're living up in great neck?</i>

14:47.600 --> 14:51.920
It's my father.
He's-- he's a little crazy.

14:51.921 --> 14:53.572
You okay?

14:53.573 --> 14:55.407
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:55.408 --> 14:57.876
<i>Hey, I can hear you talking.</i>
<i>Who are you talking to down there?</i>

14:57.877 --> 14:59.895
Do--
you live here, right?

14:59.896 --> 15:02.514
Yeah. Well, my parents do.
I'm staying with them.

15:02.515 --> 15:03.982
Oh, right.

15:03.983 --> 15:06.651
<i>Michelle, come back here.</i>
<i>Don't leave like this.</i>

15:06.652 --> 15:08.420
You want to
come in for a bit?

15:08.421 --> 15:11.489
Yeah, maybe just--
that'd be great.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.591
Just until he
calms down, maybe.

15:13.592 --> 15:15.693
I don't want, like,
everybody to call the cops.

15:15.694 --> 15:17.428
Yeah, that'd suck.

15:17.429 --> 15:18.730
I'm Leonard.

15:18.731 --> 15:19.831
- Michelle.
- Michelle.

15:19.832 --> 15:22.383
Yeah, you can
hear him screaming.

15:22.384 --> 15:25.770
<i>Come on up here!</i>
<i>Don't make me shout.</i>

15:25.771 --> 15:27.839
Hey, do you think
you want anything?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.342
- No.
- <i>Hello?</i>

15:30.343 --> 15:31.876
Hi.

15:31.877 --> 15:35.380
- Oh, Mom, this is Michelle--
- I'm-- I'm your neighbor.

15:35.381 --> 15:37.232
<i>Hello, neighbor.</i>

15:37.233 --> 15:39.668
<i>Leonard,</i>
<i>your dad just came home.</i>

15:39.669 --> 15:41.986
We're going to have
Chinese food.

15:41.987 --> 15:43.238
<i>Okay.</i>

15:43.239 --> 15:44.973
That's nice.

15:50.163 --> 15:52.464
Oh, what are
those things?

15:52.465 --> 15:53.798
- What, that?
- Yeah.

15:53.799 --> 15:55.467
Oh, that's a dreidel.

16:02.175 --> 16:04.376
Ha.
What?

16:04.377 --> 16:06.728
It smells
like mothballs.

16:06.729 --> 16:08.263
It does?

16:08.264 --> 16:10.966
No, it's a good thing.
It reminds me of my grandma's house.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.101
Yeah, well, my parents
are just trying to protect

16:13.102 --> 16:15.470
all their, you know,
designer clothes and shit.

16:15.471 --> 16:17.039
From what?

16:17.040 --> 16:18.457
Mot-- moths.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.275
Right.

16:20.276 --> 16:22.844
Right right, moths.
Of course.

16:22.845 --> 16:25.314
So you're new
here in the building?

16:25.315 --> 16:27.316
Yeah, I just moved in
last week.

16:27.317 --> 16:28.984
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

16:28.985 --> 16:30.652
Oh, welcome.

16:30.653 --> 16:32.537
<i>Thanks.</i>

16:35.858 --> 16:38.310
Is your-- is that your bedroom
in the back, in the corner?

16:38.311 --> 16:40.045
Oh, yeah, it's right--
it's right there.

16:40.046 --> 16:41.779
Right there
to the right.

16:41.780 --> 16:43.965
I can see you
from my apartment.

16:43.966 --> 16:45.367
- Ha.
- I'm sure I--

16:45.368 --> 16:47.369
I think I've seen you
through my window.

16:47.370 --> 16:50.004
- Yeah?
- Don't worry, it's not, like, a weird thing.

16:50.005 --> 16:52.940
- I'm not worried.
- Okay.

16:52.941 --> 16:54.976
Wow, those are nice.

16:55.995 --> 16:58.247
<i>What is that, yiddish?</i>

17:00.383 --> 17:03.218
So you live
with your father?

17:03.219 --> 17:05.237
Uh, no,
he's just visiting.

17:05.238 --> 17:07.506
I live with my dog, Rex.

17:07.507 --> 17:11.042
Hey, yeah, you know,
I think I heard him barking.

17:11.044 --> 17:13.762
He doesn't sound too happy.
I mean, I don't speak dog.

17:13.762 --> 17:16.146
<i>Yeah, he kind of is.</i>

17:16.147 --> 17:19.817
He-- we move a lot and he
doesn't like it when we move.

17:19.818 --> 17:21.486
So...

17:21.487 --> 17:23.221
He liked Hoboken a lot,

17:23.222 --> 17:25.990
<i>which is weird.</i>
<i>But...</i>

17:25.991 --> 17:28.627
God, you guys have
a lot of books.

17:28.628 --> 17:31.229
What are you, like,
one of those reader guys?

17:31.230 --> 17:34.015
You, like, read all the time?
You're really smart?

17:34.016 --> 17:36.317
- I don't know about that.
- I can see that.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.388
I don't really read
very much, you know?

17:40.389 --> 17:43.859
I've got ADHD,
supposedly.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.977
Yeah, they say
everybody has that.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.597
I think it's a conspiracy by
the drug companies, you know?

17:48.598 --> 17:51.182
I think you're--
hello.

17:51.183 --> 17:53.351
Hey, pop.

17:53.352 --> 17:54.936
Hello.

17:54.937 --> 17:58.323
Oh, this is Michelle.
Michelle, that's my father,

17:58.324 --> 17:59.925
Reuben.

17:59.926 --> 18:02.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:02.495 --> 18:05.831
- I'm just going.
- <i>You know, you don't have to go.</i>

18:05.832 --> 18:08.099
- <i>You can stay as long as you want.</i>
- No no, you're eating.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.702
And it's fine.
I'm sorry.

18:10.703 --> 18:14.072
<i>I'm sure he's simmered</i>
<i>down now anyway, so...</i>

18:14.073 --> 18:17.425
- <i>Thank you very much.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:17.426 --> 18:19.794
- See you around.
- Yeah, I hope so.

18:19.795 --> 18:22.397
Okay, bye.
Bye!

18:22.398 --> 18:24.399
<i>Bye.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

18:37.229 --> 18:39.213
<i>Who is that girl?</i>

18:39.214 --> 18:40.982
New neighbor--
you met her.

18:40.983 --> 18:43.085
<i>I mean, Michelle.</i>
<i>She's new in the building.</i>

18:43.086 --> 18:45.303
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I just met her myself.</i>

18:45.304 --> 18:48.606
Listen, Leonard, tomorrow
I have a lunch with Cohen.

18:48.607 --> 18:51.309
He wants you to take
those bar mitzvah pictures.

18:51.310 --> 18:54.162
<i>His daughter is coming</i>
<i>to lunch too,</i>

18:54.163 --> 18:56.914
If you want to see her.

19:01.954 --> 19:03.354
Hello?

19:03.355 --> 19:05.874
Yeah.
I heard you, pop.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.241
I'll come.

19:07.242 --> 19:08.960
All right.

19:08.961 --> 19:10.696
I'm sorry,
all right?

19:10.697 --> 19:12.747
Don't be sorry.

19:27.679 --> 19:30.015
You're sleeping
all day again.

19:30.016 --> 19:31.783
<i>You're like</i>
<i>a vampire.</i>

19:31.784 --> 19:34.052
Oh, come on, Mom!
I'm up.

19:34.053 --> 19:37.522
<i>Aren't you having lunch with
your father and the Cohens?</i>

19:37.523 --> 19:40.492
Hmm? You don't want to be late.
Come on, here-- your pills.

19:40.493 --> 19:43.495
No, I don't want to be late
for the beautiful Sandra.

19:43.496 --> 19:44.996
She is beautiful.

19:44.997 --> 19:47.999
I know.
I was joking.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.069
Mmm. It's good
for business too.

19:51.070 --> 19:53.071
We don't care about that.
You know that.

19:53.072 --> 19:55.640
All right, all right.
Don't get bent out of shape.

19:57.209 --> 19:59.344
Don't leave wet towels
on the floor.

19:59.345 --> 20:00.945
They'll get
all moldy, okay?

20:00.946 --> 20:02.647
Mom, I'm taking a shower.

20:02.648 --> 20:05.383
You don't leave in the next minute,
I'm gonna show you the world.

20:05.384 --> 20:06.851
Oh! Stop it.

21:20.042 --> 21:23.411
<i>Brighton Station and outbound Q local.</i>

21:23.412 --> 21:26.081
<i>Transfer to b on</i>
<i>this platform. Next stop,</i>

21:26.082 --> 21:28.717
<i>Sheepshead Bay.</i>
<i>Watch the closing doors.</i>

21:37.243 --> 21:38.660
Hey.

21:40.445 --> 21:41.679
Hey.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.749
What are you doing?
You don't say hello?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.501
I didn't even
see you.

21:46.502 --> 21:47.768
How you doing?

21:47.769 --> 21:49.204
- Good.
- Cool.

21:49.205 --> 21:51.206
You-- are you
going to the city?

21:51.207 --> 21:52.440
Uh, yeah.

21:54.343 --> 21:56.911
Great, you can
keep me company.

21:56.912 --> 21:59.481
Oh, yeah.

21:59.482 --> 22:01.649
Hey, you ever
count doors?

22:01.650 --> 22:05.120
- What?
- One two three four--

22:05.121 --> 22:06.871
You try and guess which
door you're going to.

22:06.872 --> 22:09.791
Eight nine 10--
I'm gonna be under 20--

22:09.792 --> 22:11.693
11...

22:11.694 --> 22:13.261
12...

22:15.665 --> 22:18.065
- 13-- that's a bad number.
- No, it's a good number.

22:18.066 --> 22:19.668
It is?

22:22.054 --> 22:23.621
<i>Excuse me.</i>

22:30.813 --> 22:32.680
So what do you do?
You work or...

22:32.681 --> 22:36.451
Yeah. I work
at a law firm.

22:36.452 --> 22:38.937
You're a lawyer?
I went to law school.

22:38.938 --> 22:40.939
I mean, I didn't finish.
You know, I'm not a real lawyer...

22:40.940 --> 22:44.108
No no no no. I'm not a
lawyer; I'm just an assistant.

22:44.109 --> 22:46.678
An assistant for life.

22:48.581 --> 22:50.248
What about you?
Do you work?

22:50.249 --> 22:51.917
Absolutely.

22:51.918 --> 22:53.818
I mean, my parents--
we got our own business.

22:53.819 --> 22:55.954
Well, that's good.
You'll never get fired.

22:55.955 --> 22:59.090
Yeah, there's no risk
in it, though.

22:59.091 --> 23:01.225
It's like sometimes
you just feel fucking dead.

23:01.226 --> 23:03.795
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.768
<i>Next stop 57th Street.</i>

23:09.769 --> 23:14.172
<i>For Queens-bound service,</i>
<i>transfer available to the N, R, W.</i>

23:16.442 --> 23:19.544
So let me
ask you something:

23:19.545 --> 23:23.698
If you could do, like,
anything in the world,

23:23.699 --> 23:25.817
You know, like,
anything you wanted to do,

23:25.818 --> 23:29.070
what-- what do you
think it would be?

23:29.071 --> 23:30.822
I like photography.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.691
Really?
You're a photographer?

23:32.692 --> 23:34.325
I'm gonna be.

23:34.326 --> 23:36.144
Wow.

23:36.145 --> 23:39.431
That's funny because I could--
I could sort of tell that you were,

23:39.432 --> 23:40.865
like, creative.

23:42.735 --> 23:45.703
God, that's very cool
that you're an artist.

23:45.704 --> 23:49.373
Well, I-- I don't know
if you can call me an artist.

23:49.374 --> 23:53.511
No, you know what? Never let
anybody discourage you from that.

23:53.512 --> 23:54.779
I'm serious.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.848
Really.

23:56.849 --> 24:00.051
Wait, put your number
in my phone

24:00.052 --> 24:01.786
and then we can,
like, text.

24:01.787 --> 24:04.055
Oh, excellent.

24:07.193 --> 24:09.327
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a special ringtone

24:09.328 --> 24:11.062
so I know it's you
when you're calling.

24:11.063 --> 24:12.364
All right.

24:12.365 --> 24:14.032
<i>Next stop, 57th Street.</i>

24:14.033 --> 24:16.534
Oh, shit,
this is my stop.

24:16.535 --> 24:19.037
I gotta go to
a meeting with my boss.

24:19.038 --> 24:21.106
You know, I'm going to the park,
like, six blocks away.

24:21.107 --> 24:23.841
I'd rather just walk
than be in this stuffy place.

24:23.842 --> 24:26.460
All right.

24:31.383 --> 24:33.484
Hey, I could show you some
of my pictures sometime

24:33.485 --> 24:35.486
- if you want to see something.
- Oh, that would be great.

24:35.487 --> 24:38.589
- Yeah?
- I would love that.

24:38.590 --> 24:41.893
So, Leonard, it was great
to hang out with you.

24:41.894 --> 24:43.561
Oh, yeah.
You too.

24:43.562 --> 24:46.030
And I guess I'll see you
around the building.

24:46.031 --> 24:48.132
Not if I see you first.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.434
Yeah, I'll see you.
Hey, if you need a place to hide,

24:50.435 --> 24:52.036
- you know where to come.
- Oh, yeah.

24:52.037 --> 24:53.604
- I'll keep that in mind.
- All right.

24:53.605 --> 24:55.606
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

25:16.729 --> 25:18.396
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

25:18.397 --> 25:21.432
<i>It's 11 past 7:00.</i>
<i>You talk to him.</i>

25:21.433 --> 25:24.769
<i>Where were you all day?</i>
<i>We were worried.</i>

25:24.770 --> 25:28.322
I tried you on your cell phone.
All we got was the message.

25:28.323 --> 25:32.293
- Oh, yeah?
- What? You don't show up for lunch.

25:32.294 --> 25:34.529
Yeah, there was
a terrorist alert--

25:34.530 --> 25:35.914
- <i>What?</i>
- --In the subway.

25:35.915 --> 25:37.482
- <i>Terrorism?</i>
- Yeah.

25:37.483 --> 25:40.919
I'll just call
everyone and apologize.

25:45.691 --> 25:47.575
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

25:47.576 --> 25:49.293
Sandra?
It's Leonard.

25:49.294 --> 25:50.628
<i>Hi!</i>

25:50.629 --> 25:54.064
Hey. Hey, I'm so sorry
I missed lunch today.

25:54.065 --> 25:56.818
I just-- I was down getting
equipment for my camera

25:56.819 --> 25:59.019
and it's like you have to wait in line
forever after they give you the number.

25:59.020 --> 26:01.288
<i>I had the wrong</i>
<i>number and then--</i>

26:01.289 --> 26:04.392
No no no no, it's okay.
I got there late anyway.

26:04.393 --> 26:06.144
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

26:06.145 --> 26:10.665
Yeah? Well, I don't know
what you're--

26:10.666 --> 26:13.000
What you're doing
tomorrow, but...

26:13.001 --> 26:17.038
I don't know, if you want
to go see a movie or something?

26:17.039 --> 26:20.607
Maybe-- "Sound of Music"
isn't playing, but, you know...

26:20.608 --> 26:22.960
We could find, maybe, something.

26:22.961 --> 26:25.546
<i>My God, you're never going
to let me live that one down.</i>

26:25.547 --> 26:27.882
<i>Okay, no.</i>
<i>Yeah, let's go.</i>

26:31.470 --> 26:33.971
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah.

26:33.972 --> 26:37.374
- Good.
- <i>Yeah, that'll be fun.</i>

26:37.375 --> 26:42.113
Okay, then I'll call you--
I'll call you tomorrow.

26:42.114 --> 26:44.548
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay? All right, have a nice night.

26:44.549 --> 26:46.967
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

27:06.138 --> 27:09.640
Hi. What are you doing?
You're taking my picture?

27:09.641 --> 27:11.726
Yeah.

27:11.727 --> 27:13.994
I was actually trying
to get your attention.

27:13.995 --> 27:16.097
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>You got it.</i>

27:16.098 --> 27:17.498
How you doing?

27:17.499 --> 27:18.749
Good.
What's going on?

27:18.750 --> 27:20.418
<i>You look</i>
<i>all dressed up.</i>

27:20.419 --> 27:23.121
Oh, well,
I'm going out.

27:23.122 --> 27:25.239
<i>I'm gonna go dancing</i>
<i>with some friends of mine.</i>

27:25.240 --> 27:26.807
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

27:26.808 --> 27:29.576
I was thinking about maybe going
out, but, you know, I don't know.

27:29.577 --> 27:31.578
Leonard, we can't have that.
Come with us.

27:31.579 --> 27:33.614
<i>Hey, you heard of</i>
<i>a goddamn phone?</i>

27:33.615 --> 27:37.986
Hey, you know what, Doug?
There's a fucking storm coming, man.

27:39.955 --> 27:41.973
Why don't you
come with us?

27:41.974 --> 27:43.640
Yeah-- maybe, yeah.

27:43.641 --> 27:45.910
- <i>It's gonna be good.</i>
- All right.

27:45.911 --> 27:47.962
We're gonna leave in, like, 30 minutes.
Is that all right?

27:47.963 --> 27:50.215
- Yeah. 30 minutes, downstairs?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

27:50.216 --> 27:52.149
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll see you down there.

27:56.388 --> 27:58.372
My account number?

27:58.373 --> 28:01.125
5499...

28:01.126 --> 28:04.929
1407...

28:04.930 --> 28:08.065
<i>143...</i>

28:08.066 --> 28:10.267
- <i>209.</i>
- <i>That's Western Mutual Life.</i>

28:10.268 --> 28:12.519
- <i>And the expiration date is...</i>
- <i>And by...</i>

28:12.520 --> 28:14.655
- <i>03/25/11.</i>

28:14.656 --> 28:17.191
- <i>and by contributions to PBS stations...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

28:17.192 --> 28:18.693
<i>...from viewers like you.</i>

28:19.845 --> 28:22.547
Oh!
You look hot!

28:25.584 --> 28:26.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:26.985 --> 28:28.752
- Hi.
- I'm Stephanie.

28:28.753 --> 28:30.454
Dayna.
What's up?

28:30.455 --> 28:32.423
<i>What's up, what's up?</i>

28:32.424 --> 28:35.126
<i>Ah, this was my song
with my crew, right?</i>

28:35.127 --> 28:37.561
- I was dancing-- but then I had my--
- <i>With his crew.</i>

28:37.562 --> 28:39.097
I did.
I really did.

28:39.098 --> 28:41.899
<i>So I go, "who's gonna</i>
<i>rock this party right?"</i>

28:41.900 --> 28:46.070
And you guys go,
"L to the E-O-N-A-R-D"--

28:46.071 --> 28:47.605
- My name, right?
- <i>Okay.</i>

28:47.606 --> 28:50.641
Okay. So, who's gonna rock
the party right?

28:50.642 --> 28:53.144
L to the E-O-N-A-R-D.

28:53.145 --> 28:55.379
Who's gonna rock
the party right?

28:55.380 --> 28:57.448
L to the E-O-N-A-R-D.

28:57.449 --> 28:59.650
- <i>Ladies--</i>
- I can't spell!

28:59.651 --> 29:02.486
What? You wanna bring it on?

29:02.487 --> 29:04.588
'Cause I'll blow up your face
like Louis Armstrong.

29:04.589 --> 29:07.358
And if you can't handle
the serious battle,

29:07.359 --> 29:10.294
you mi-- you might want
to step up-- oh, shit.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.496
- Aww!
- <i>It was, like, 15 years ago.</i>

29:12.497 --> 29:14.799
I'm sorry! No, that was cute.
That was good.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.135
- It was cute?
- <i>Yeah, you are cute.</i>

29:17.136 --> 29:19.237
He's my new best friend.

29:19.238 --> 29:23.007
- I was just about to say that.
- I gotta be out by midnight.

29:23.008 --> 29:25.910
Michelle, what are you doing?
You still doing E.?

29:25.911 --> 29:27.645
<i>It's just</i>
<i>for a night.</i>

29:27.646 --> 29:29.680
God, don't take
another one.

29:29.681 --> 29:31.849
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>I gotta do something.</i>

29:31.850 --> 29:35.119
I'm living in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

29:35.120 --> 29:37.488
So, Leonard,
you go clubbing a lot?

29:37.489 --> 29:39.023
- Yeah.
- <i>You go clubbing?</i>

29:39.024 --> 29:41.092
<i>Are you gonna bring it</i>
<i>on the dance floor?</i>

29:41.093 --> 29:42.994
I'll do what
I have to do.

29:44.830 --> 29:47.031
<i>He goes clubbing.</i>

29:47.032 --> 29:49.167
<i>I think you're gonna</i>
<i>like this, Leonard.</i>

29:49.168 --> 29:51.669
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna dance with me?

29:51.670 --> 29:54.405
Maybe. I won't make you
look bad, you know?

29:54.406 --> 29:56.307
- Hi, girls!
- Hi, Antonio!

29:56.308 --> 29:57.741
Hey! Hey!

29:57.742 --> 29:59.610
- All right.
- Antonio!

29:59.611 --> 30:01.445
- What's up?
- How you doing?

30:01.446 --> 30:03.447
- This is my friend Leonard.
- You got I.D.?

30:03.448 --> 30:05.883
- He's fucking with you.
- I'm only kidding. Go ahead.

30:05.884 --> 30:07.551
Getting off in 10 minutes,
all right?

30:07.552 --> 30:09.270
- <i>Okay!</i>
- All right.

30:09.271 --> 30:12.339
Yeah.
Relax relax relax relax.

32:16.164 --> 32:17.564
Michelle!

32:41.656 --> 32:43.590
Are you all right?

32:46.327 --> 32:48.896
- What's the matter?
- Just go back inside, okay?

32:48.897 --> 32:50.898
I'll be fine.

32:53.201 --> 32:57.704
You know, you--
you can talk to me if you want.

32:57.705 --> 33:00.174
You know, you can
tell me anything.

33:04.980 --> 33:07.248
- Is it your father?
- Oh.

33:10.302 --> 33:12.670
No.

33:12.671 --> 33:14.905
That guy you're with?

33:16.908 --> 33:18.209
Yeah.

33:21.813 --> 33:24.615
I was-- I was supposed to
meet up with him tonight

33:24.616 --> 33:26.917
but now he says
he can't make it.

33:28.453 --> 33:31.489
He says he's gonna stay
with his wife.

33:32.591 --> 33:35.025
He's married;
he has a son.

33:35.026 --> 33:38.796
Oh, fuck, I'm so
fucking stupid.

33:38.797 --> 33:40.698
Don't say that.
You're not stupid.

33:40.699 --> 33:42.700
- I am.
- You're not stupid.

33:42.701 --> 33:44.802
- I'm so fucking stupid.
- Don't say that.

33:44.803 --> 33:47.305
No, you're not.
Come here.

33:47.306 --> 33:49.323
Don't say that,
okay?

33:50.892 --> 33:52.960
He keeps telling me
he's gonna leave them.

33:52.961 --> 33:54.895
You know, he tells me
over and over.

33:54.896 --> 33:56.597
And I never
asked him to do that.

33:56.598 --> 33:59.199
And now I can't think
of anything else.

34:01.903 --> 34:04.772
- I'm such a piece of shit.
- No.

34:04.773 --> 34:06.607
Look at me.

34:06.608 --> 34:10.543
You're very high right now.
You're very emotional.

34:10.545 --> 34:12.880
You shouldn't think
about this right now, okay?

34:12.880 --> 34:15.449
Let's just go home.
I'll take you home, okay?

34:15.449 --> 34:16.984
- Ahh.
- You need to calm down.

34:16.985 --> 34:19.152
You don't want to be out
here with all these people.

34:19.154 --> 34:21.321
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

34:21.322 --> 34:23.322
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

34:23.324 --> 34:25.175
We're gonna go home.

34:25.176 --> 34:26.842
All right.
I'll be right back.

34:26.844 --> 34:29.079
Okay.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.947
I'll wait--
I'll wait right here.

34:30.949 --> 34:33.117
Ahh, fuck.

34:33.118 --> 34:35.219
Can I just get
my bag?

34:35.219 --> 34:37.621
- I was in before. I left my bag.
- All right, go ahead.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.856
Sorry.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.734
Fucking boyfriend.

34:50.735 --> 34:52.402
Fuck.

35:10.322 --> 35:12.323
- What's up, man?
- What up?

35:12.324 --> 35:14.492
- I'm just going back in.
- You on the list?

35:14.493 --> 35:17.595
- I was just in here.
- Yeah yeah, you and everybody else.

35:17.596 --> 35:19.580
No, I just
came out, man.

35:19.581 --> 35:21.515
I came out. I was
with Stephanie and--

35:21.516 --> 35:23.751
I'm sorry, man. If you're not
on the list, I can't let you in.

35:23.752 --> 35:25.586
- I was just inside.
- You're gonna have to move.

35:25.587 --> 35:27.021
Go ahead.

35:27.022 --> 35:28.972
Are you serious?

35:35.530 --> 35:38.232
Ta-- taxi?

35:38.233 --> 35:40.767
Who the fuck am I kidding?
I'll never get a taxi.

35:57.635 --> 36:00.804
You have one message.

36:02.139 --> 36:04.140
<i>Hey, Leonard,</i>
<i>it's Sandra.</i>

36:04.141 --> 36:07.578
- Hey, Sandra.
- <i>Um, listen, I know we had plans tomorrow,</i>

36:07.579 --> 36:11.198
<i>but I totally forgot-- tomorrow
night's my dad's birthday party</i>

36:11.199 --> 36:13.000
<i>and I gotta</i>
<i>go to that.</i>

36:13.001 --> 36:16.269
<i>But my mom said your parents</i>
<i>are going to be going too</i>

36:16.270 --> 36:18.272
<i>so I guess</i>
<i>you'll be with them?</i>

36:18.273 --> 36:20.975
<i>We could go out</i>
<i>after if you want.</i>

36:20.976 --> 36:22.893
<i>So just call me and let me</i>
<i>know if that's all right.</i>

36:22.894 --> 36:25.929
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

36:25.930 --> 36:27.798
<i>you're not</i>
<i>going to believe this,</i>

36:27.799 --> 36:30.401
<i>But "the Sound of Music" is
playing on cable right now.</i>

36:30.402 --> 36:33.053
<i>And I still love it.</i>
<i>It's very good.</i>

36:33.054 --> 36:35.872
<i>Okay, call me.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

36:56.444 --> 36:58.779
<i>Hello?</i>

36:58.780 --> 37:00.614
Hey, I'm back.

37:00.615 --> 37:03.083
<i>Leonard,</i>
<i>you're awake.</i>

37:03.084 --> 37:04.751
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:04.752 --> 37:06.787
<i>Yeah, you--</i>
<i>you okay?</i>

37:06.788 --> 37:09.390
Can you see me?
I can't see you.

37:09.391 --> 37:11.492
No...

37:11.493 --> 37:13.527
No, I'm--
I'm in bed.

37:13.528 --> 37:17.264
Mmm. Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry about what happened.

37:17.265 --> 37:19.716
I went back
into the club

37:19.717 --> 37:22.569
<i>and I went into the
bathroom and I passed out.</i>

37:22.570 --> 37:26.390
- What?
- I literally passed out in the bathroom.

37:26.391 --> 37:28.909
Yeah, 'cause I waited
outside for, like, 30 minutes.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.778
And they wouldn't let me
back in the club.

37:30.779 --> 37:32.362
- I tried to call you.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

37:32.363 --> 37:34.114
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to leave you.

37:34.115 --> 37:36.283
I'm so sorry.
It was crazy.

37:36.284 --> 37:38.902
I have to go to the doctor.
I don't know what the fuck.

37:38.903 --> 37:41.104
<i>I'm just</i>
<i>stressed out, I think.</i>

37:41.105 --> 37:43.190
<i>Yeah. I don't know.</i>
<i>It sounds like you're</i>

37:43.191 --> 37:45.492
<i>In a really bad</i>
<i>situation with that guy.</i>

37:45.493 --> 37:47.361
It's horrible.
This guy,

37:47.362 --> 37:49.830
You know, he's a partner
in a law firm where I work.

37:49.831 --> 37:52.116
<i>And I got into</i>
<i>this thing now.</i>

37:52.117 --> 37:54.117
<i>You know, he pays</i>
<i>for this apartment.</i>

37:54.118 --> 37:57.254
And his mother
lives nearby,

37:57.255 --> 38:00.658
So it's like the excuse
for when he comes out here.

38:00.659 --> 38:02.275
Oh, yeah.

38:02.276 --> 38:05.045
<i>But you know,</i>
<i>he's not really like that.</i>

38:05.046 --> 38:07.014
<i>He's actually</i>
<i>really amazing.</i>

38:07.015 --> 38:10.184
<i>He's brilliant and</i>
<i>he can be really sweet.</i>

38:10.185 --> 38:11.985
<i>I think</i>
<i>you'd like him.</i>

38:11.986 --> 38:15.906
My friends think he's never going
to leave his wife. What do you think?

38:15.907 --> 38:18.858
<i>I've never met him.</i>
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>

38:18.859 --> 38:20.761
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>your relationship is.</i>

38:20.762 --> 38:24.031
Ah. Well,
you know what, Leonard?

38:24.032 --> 38:27.484
You should come and have
dinner with us tomorrow night.

38:27.485 --> 38:30.754
<i>He's always telling me, you know,
I should hang out with friends and stuff.</i>

38:30.755 --> 38:33.374
<i>This way you could come</i>
<i>and eat with us</i>

38:33.375 --> 38:35.726
<i>and then you could,</i>
<i>like, tell me</i>

38:35.727 --> 38:37.995
<i>if you think he's</i>
<i>telling the truth, you know?</i>

38:37.996 --> 38:41.732
<i>Because you're a guy and then you would
be able to know that kind of a thing.</i>

38:41.733 --> 38:44.001
Yeah, I don't know.
I gotta, uh--

38:44.002 --> 38:46.470
I gotta check
my schedule.

38:46.471 --> 38:48.521
You know, I got
a lot to do.

38:48.522 --> 38:51.258
<i>I can't tell if he's</i>
<i>telling me the truth, and...</i>

38:51.259 --> 38:53.861
<i>if you came,</i>
<i>it would be so great.</i>

38:53.862 --> 38:56.363
I don't know, you know.
I gotta see.

38:56.364 --> 38:59.767
<i>I need this kind of,</i>
<i>you know, help right now</i>

38:59.768 --> 39:01.935
<i>because I'm going crazy.</i>
<i>I can't--</i>

39:01.936 --> 39:03.871
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>You know something?</i>

39:03.872 --> 39:05.906
<i>I'll bet you he would take us
to his favorite restaurant.</i>

39:05.907 --> 39:08.241
It's called San Domenico.
It's in the city.

39:08.242 --> 39:10.777
It's Italian and
it's really nice.

39:10.778 --> 39:15.532
<i>It's great food and we, like,
drink Brandy Alexanders.</i>

39:15.533 --> 39:17.267
<i>It's the best.</i>

39:17.268 --> 39:19.903
Do you really want me to go?
Do you think it would make a difference?

39:19.904 --> 39:21.988
I really really really
want you to go.

39:21.989 --> 39:23.890
I think it'll make
a difference.

39:23.891 --> 39:27.528
- <i>Please.</i>
- Ahh.

39:27.529 --> 39:29.096
Okay, I'll go.

39:29.097 --> 39:30.848
<i>Thank you, Leonard.</i>

39:30.849 --> 39:33.834
<i>I will officially shut up</i>
<i>now and let you go to bed.</i>

39:33.835 --> 39:36.870
Okay.
Hey, sweet dreams.

39:36.871 --> 39:40.057
You too.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

39:40.058 --> 39:42.809
<i>Oh, wear</i>
<i>something nice.</i>

39:42.810 --> 39:44.260
Good night.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.517
<i>The defense didn't
really excel last week,</i>

39:50.518 --> 39:53.603
<i>But I know in the past</i>
<i>Giant teams...</i>

39:59.311 --> 40:01.194
<i>Hey.</i>

40:09.086 --> 40:11.388
I think I'll have
a New Year's party this year.

40:11.389 --> 40:12.922
What do you think?

40:12.923 --> 40:14.524
Well, it's not even
Thanksgiving yet, Mom.

40:14.525 --> 40:16.260
<i>No, but I like</i>
<i>to plan ahead.</i>

40:16.261 --> 40:18.511
Are you going out?

40:18.512 --> 40:20.864
Yeah, I'm gonna get some dinner
with a couple friends.

40:20.865 --> 40:22.416
I'll be back early.

40:22.417 --> 40:24.885
- <i>That's a nice suit.</i>
- Yeah.

40:26.187 --> 40:28.572
You look handsome.

40:28.573 --> 40:29.923
Thanks, Mom.

40:29.924 --> 40:32.325
<i>I'm going to go out too</i>
<i>with your dad.</i>

40:32.326 --> 40:34.227
<i>It's Michael Cohen's</i>
<i>birthday.</i>

40:34.228 --> 40:36.813
If you want to stop by
later, I'm sure...

40:36.814 --> 40:38.515
You're going to
be welcome.

40:38.516 --> 40:41.084
<i>You gonna come?</i>

40:41.085 --> 40:44.822
Ahh, maybe I will.

40:44.823 --> 40:46.540
I'll see you later.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.108
Have fun.

42:10.407 --> 42:12.809
- Good evening.
- Ah, good evening, sir.

42:12.810 --> 42:14.911
I'm here to meet
some people.

42:14.912 --> 42:17.081
And do you have
a reservation?

42:17.082 --> 42:19.199
Oh, it wouldn't be
under my name.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.134
Do you know
when it's for?

42:21.135 --> 42:23.037
6:30.

42:23.038 --> 42:26.473
- Are you Mr. Kreandator?
- Kraditor.

42:26.474 --> 42:28.375
Yes, you're with
the Blatt party.

42:28.376 --> 42:30.144
You're the first
to arrive.

42:30.145 --> 42:33.030
Would you like to wait at
the bar or go to your table?

42:33.031 --> 42:34.464
I'll be seated.

42:34.465 --> 42:36.082
Can I take
your coat?

42:39.454 --> 42:41.388
Thank you.
Jeffrey.

42:42.657 --> 42:44.591
This way, sir.

42:44.592 --> 42:46.693
<i>Would you like a drink</i>
<i>while you're waiting, sir?</i>

42:46.694 --> 42:50.296
Yes, I'll have
a Brandy Alexander, please.

43:40.999 --> 43:43.466
Here you go.

43:43.467 --> 43:45.368
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

43:45.369 --> 43:47.570
Sir, would you
like a straw?

43:47.571 --> 43:49.706
<i>I can bring you</i>
<i>a real straw if you'd like.</i>

43:49.707 --> 43:51.241
This is perfect.
Thank you.

43:51.242 --> 43:52.709
Just...

44:08.309 --> 44:10.244
Thanks so much.

44:17.084 --> 44:19.119
Hey.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.854
Hi.

44:20.855 --> 44:24.157
- I can't stand up.
- Ron, this is Leonard.

44:24.158 --> 44:25.726
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- Very nice to meet you.

44:25.727 --> 44:27.761
- Nice to meet you too.
- Shall I go, um--

44:27.762 --> 44:29.596
- Shall I go here?
- Yeah, I'll sit here.

44:29.597 --> 44:31.097
Oh, okay.

44:31.098 --> 44:32.733
- I'll go around.
- I'm gonna come--

44:32.734 --> 44:36.503
Um, she'll have-- oh, I see you've
got the same thing right here.

44:36.504 --> 44:40.340
Very nice.
Brandy Alexander and a...

44:40.341 --> 44:43.610
Maker's mark
on the rocks, please.

44:43.611 --> 44:45.945
Right away, Mr. Blatt.

44:45.946 --> 44:47.714
Nice to finally
meet you there, Leonard.

44:47.715 --> 44:49.449
Nice meeting you
as well.

44:49.450 --> 44:51.385
So Michelle tells me
you guys are neighbors.

44:51.386 --> 44:53.754
Yeah. Yeah, we live right
across the way from each other.

44:53.755 --> 44:56.323
- Nice. You guys can keep an eye on each other.
- 

44:57.958 --> 45:00.660
That's my old neighborhood, actually.
My mom lives out there.

45:00.661 --> 45:02.395
- Is that right?
- You go to Totonno's?

45:02.396 --> 45:04.498
- Oh, sure. I know the place.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

45:04.499 --> 45:04.986
Good pizza.

45:04.987 --> 45:07.467
<i>It's really great pizza.
A lot of memories there.</i>

45:07.468 --> 45:09.886
So what kind of work
do you do?

45:09.887 --> 45:12.572
I work for
my father's company.

45:12.573 --> 45:15.642
Leonard's a photographer.
He's really good.

45:15.643 --> 45:17.144
- Is that right?
- <i>Yeah, really good.</i>

45:17.145 --> 45:18.795
What kind of photography
do you do?

45:18.796 --> 45:22.182
- <i>Fashion?</i>
- Ah, land-- landscapes.

45:22.183 --> 45:24.034
That's great.
That's good.

45:24.035 --> 45:25.568
As long as you love it--

45:25.569 --> 45:27.771
As long as you love
what you're doing.

45:27.772 --> 45:30.290
And I think that we should get some
menus. Otherwise, we'll be late.

45:30.291 --> 45:31.741
Well, they gave me
a menu already.

45:31.742 --> 45:33.443
I don't know if it's...

45:33.444 --> 45:36.679
I don't know if Michelle told you--
we've got opera tickets tonight.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.081
Oh, yeah.

45:38.082 --> 45:39.566
<i>We try to go as often</i>
<i>as we can.</i>

45:39.567 --> 45:41.318
I mean, you know,
I know she loves it.

45:41.319 --> 45:42.919
Yeah, but you
like it too.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.721
- I don't force you.
- <i>Of course you don't.</i>

45:44.722 --> 45:46.957
<i>Absolutely, I love it.</i>
<i>But I know how much it means to you.</i>

45:46.958 --> 45:48.425
That's true.

45:48.426 --> 45:51.344
<i>You know what the great thing</i>
<i>about it is for me?</i>

45:51.345 --> 45:54.581
- It makes you feel special when you're there.
- Mmm.

45:54.582 --> 45:56.966
<i>I mean, I'm lucky--</i>
<i>my law firm gives me a box.</i>

45:56.967 --> 45:59.385
<i>But I'm telling you something:</i>
<i>If you've got somebody</i>

45:59.386 --> 46:02.155
that you love,

46:02.156 --> 46:04.090
you take 'em to the opera.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.278
<i>Hey, darlin'.</i>

46:09.680 --> 46:11.531
Yeah, I ought to bring
my girlfriend.

46:11.532 --> 46:13.366
That sounds romantic.

46:13.367 --> 46:16.302
- What? You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

46:16.303 --> 46:18.421
Leonard, you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

46:18.422 --> 46:19.655
- I didn't?
- No.

46:19.656 --> 46:21.608
Well, we haven't
been going out that long--

46:21.609 --> 46:23.443
That's probably why.
It would've come up.

46:23.444 --> 46:26.280
A man's got to have his secrets, Honey.
Come on.

46:26.281 --> 46:29.366
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>leave him alone.</i>

46:29.367 --> 46:31.234
I'm going to go
to the ladies' room.

46:31.235 --> 46:32.703
<i>Again, baby?</i>

46:32.704 --> 46:34.638
I'll be right back.

46:42.864 --> 46:45.499
<i>Hey, listen,</i>
<i>Leonard.</i>

46:45.500 --> 46:47.033
Come here.

46:48.736 --> 46:52.005
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to--

46:52.006 --> 46:53.774
I want you to keep
an eye on her.

46:53.775 --> 46:56.059
I want you to look out for her
for me a little bit, if you can.

46:56.060 --> 46:58.144
She in trouble?

46:58.145 --> 47:00.964
I think she might
be using again.

47:02.867 --> 47:04.918
I mean, I know I shouldn't
be saying this, but...

47:04.919 --> 47:07.270
I mean, I can see
the signs.

47:07.271 --> 47:10.440
- I haven't seen nothing.
- Yeah? Sure?

47:11.808 --> 47:14.077
I mean, you know, she comes
from a good family,

47:14.078 --> 47:16.212
plenty of money.

47:16.213 --> 47:18.415
You know, and her father
goes and spends it all

47:18.416 --> 47:20.400
and boom, that's it--
the whole thing goes to hell.

47:20.401 --> 47:22.436
So, whatever, just do me
a favor, all right?

47:22.437 --> 47:25.072
Just-- just keep
an eye on her.

47:25.073 --> 47:28.024
Just don't let her get
involved in that kind of thing.

47:28.025 --> 47:30.526
Yeah. I don't play
with that shit.

47:32.329 --> 47:33.879
I appreciate it.

47:35.416 --> 47:36.682
Thank you.

47:39.286 --> 47:41.537
<i>You seem like you</i>
<i>have a good heart, you know?</i>

47:41.538 --> 47:44.925
To tell you the truth, you
kind of remind me of my son.

47:47.962 --> 47:49.796
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hi.

47:49.797 --> 47:52.799
What are you guys
talking about?

47:52.800 --> 47:55.601
All right. Well, we're talking
about how beautiful you are.

47:55.602 --> 47:58.271
Uh, the specials, please.
We're starving

47:58.272 --> 48:00.707
- <i>And we're kind of pressed for time.</i>
- <i>Yes, Mr. Blatt.</i>

48:00.708 --> 48:02.108
<i>Can we have the specials?</i>

48:20.128 --> 48:22.996
Okay, Leonard, this is
where we part ways.

48:22.997 --> 48:25.232
Yeah, it was
good to meet you.

48:25.233 --> 48:26.900
It was good to
meet you too.

48:26.901 --> 48:30.270
Hey, Carl, why don't you
take him where he needs to go?

48:30.271 --> 48:31.971
That's nice.
Thank you.

48:31.972 --> 48:33.140
<i>No problem.</i>

48:33.141 --> 48:35.409
- Bye!
- Have fun.

48:40.781 --> 48:42.982
Yeah, I agree.

49:37.572 --> 49:39.039
- Hi.
- Hey.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.574
How you doin'?

49:40.575 --> 49:43.309
Good good. Um, your parents
told me you'd be home.

49:43.310 --> 49:45.845
They said you wanted me
to come over.

49:45.846 --> 49:48.181
They're at
my father's birthday.

49:48.182 --> 49:49.849
Yeah.
Yeah, come on in.

49:49.850 --> 49:51.451
Come in.

49:51.452 --> 49:54.220
Um, you want
something to drink?

49:54.221 --> 49:55.355
Yeah, sure.

49:55.356 --> 49:56.956
Yeah? Okay.

49:59.226 --> 50:00.977
What is this
that you're playing?

50:00.978 --> 50:03.813
- Oh, opera.
- <i>Opera?</i>

50:03.814 --> 50:05.415
- <i>You like it?</i>
- Yeah.

50:05.416 --> 50:07.918
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I've never been to the opera.

50:07.919 --> 50:11.154
I've been to "the nutcracker,"
but-- when I was little.

50:11.155 --> 50:13.940
Yeah? What do you want,
water, soda?

50:13.941 --> 50:16.509
- <i>Soda, please.</i>
- Lot of options, yeah.

50:18.612 --> 50:20.647
I was just out with
a couple friends,

50:20.648 --> 50:22.549
with some business
I have to do.

50:22.550 --> 50:23.783
Thank you.

50:23.784 --> 50:25.284
Is this
your whole family?

50:25.285 --> 50:27.603
Yeah. Well, actually
I was adopted.

50:27.604 --> 50:30.039
I was in line to be
King of Denmark.

50:31.108 --> 50:32.942
<i>No, yeah, that is.</i>

50:32.943 --> 50:35.595
That's my parents-- that's where
they met, the workmen's circle dance.

50:35.596 --> 50:37.146
My uncle Tobias
introduced them.

50:37.147 --> 50:38.949
That's him right there
with the mustache.

50:38.950 --> 50:41.468
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, my dad just came over from Israel.

50:41.469 --> 50:44.186
- And...
- Oh.

50:44.187 --> 50:46.088
Yeah, it's cute.

50:46.089 --> 50:48.691
That's me.

50:48.692 --> 50:50.260
My mom as a girl.

50:50.261 --> 50:52.361
These are dirty,
aren't they?

50:53.697 --> 50:55.915
What's the matter?

50:57.451 --> 50:59.936
Umm...

50:59.937 --> 51:04.123
Leonard, this wasn't your idea
for me to come over, was it?

51:04.124 --> 51:06.275
What?

51:06.276 --> 51:08.278
What do you mean?

51:08.279 --> 51:11.114
It's okay you
didn't call me back.

51:12.299 --> 51:13.716
I--

51:13.717 --> 51:16.018
We don't have
to go out.

51:16.019 --> 51:19.188
I mean,

51:19.189 --> 51:23.510
There are a lot of
guys who just--

51:23.511 --> 51:26.696
That want to
go out with me.

51:47.435 --> 51:49.669
Oh my--
oh my God.

51:57.611 --> 51:59.645
I do like you.

52:11.225 --> 52:12.976
Well, it feels
a little strange

52:12.977 --> 52:15.327
with my mother
staring right there.

53:16.923 --> 53:18.358
Mmm.

53:19.793 --> 53:22.311
I should go

53:22.312 --> 53:26.282
before your parents come home
and see us like this.

53:26.283 --> 53:28.201
Are you kidding?
They'd be happy.

53:28.202 --> 53:30.236
Probably picking out
baby names.

53:32.139 --> 53:33.372
God.

53:41.832 --> 53:43.933
So I heard you're going to
take the pictures

53:43.934 --> 53:46.302
at my brother's
bar mitzvah next month.

53:46.303 --> 53:47.637
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:47.638 --> 53:49.956
I'm taking the black
and whites-- the art shots.

53:49.957 --> 53:52.324
<i>That's cool.</i>

53:52.325 --> 53:54.977
My friend's having
a party on Thursday night.

53:54.978 --> 53:56.429
You wanna come?

53:56.430 --> 53:58.648
I'll try to see
if I'm free.

53:58.649 --> 54:00.166
Okay.

54:03.170 --> 54:04.603
Will you call me?

54:04.604 --> 54:05.839
Yeah.

54:07.808 --> 54:09.575
<i>I'll see myself out.</i>

54:09.576 --> 54:10.877
<i>Okay.</i>

54:11.946 --> 54:14.613
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

54:47.998 --> 54:51.000
- Hey.
- <i>Leonard, could you meet me up on the roof?</i>

54:51.001 --> 54:52.285
What time is it?

54:52.286 --> 54:54.037
<i>It's early.</i>
<i>It's like 6:30.</i>

54:54.038 --> 54:55.437
<i>Could you come up?</i>

54:55.438 --> 54:58.440
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'll come up now.

54:58.441 --> 55:00.143
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Right.

55:12.055 --> 55:14.307
- Hey.
- Hi.

55:14.308 --> 55:15.841
It's fucking cold.

55:15.842 --> 55:19.245
I know. I'm sorry,
but he's downstairs.

55:19.246 --> 55:21.180
So what did
you think?

55:29.807 --> 55:32.775
Leonard, what did you think of Ronald?
Tell me.

55:36.213 --> 55:38.564
I don't know.

55:38.565 --> 55:41.434
What-- what do you
want me to say?

55:45.972 --> 55:48.540
Do you think he's going
to be with me for good?

55:52.596 --> 55:55.064
Seriously.

55:55.065 --> 55:56.766
I don't think so.

55:58.585 --> 56:00.236
Sorry.

56:09.429 --> 56:12.932
He's got this fucking business
trip he wants me to go on.

56:12.933 --> 56:14.667
I don't know what to do.

56:15.903 --> 56:19.138
Michelle, come on!
What are you doing?

56:20.573 --> 56:22.708
Come on, seriously.
He's the kind of guy

56:22.709 --> 56:25.244
who's got this
whole life,

56:25.245 --> 56:27.129
His family
and shit.

56:27.130 --> 56:29.765
You think he's gonna
leave all that?

56:32.202 --> 56:34.053
I know
I would.

56:36.891 --> 56:39.375
I'd definitely leave
everything for you.

56:44.715 --> 56:47.016
Leonard, you're very sweet,
but I--

56:47.017 --> 56:50.119
I think if you knew me better,
you wouldn't feel that way.

56:51.939 --> 56:54.139
I don't care.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.292
Leonard, listen to me.

56:56.293 --> 56:58.210
You're like a brother
to me now.

56:58.211 --> 56:58.333
Oh!

56:58.334 --> 57:00.647
I know we've only known each
other for a couple of weeks.

57:00.648 --> 57:03.249
But I-- I feel like I
could tell you anything.

57:03.250 --> 57:05.818
You know? I need you
to be my friend.

57:05.819 --> 57:08.287
You know, why don't you
tell Ronald, okay?

57:08.288 --> 57:10.289
Tell Ronald.
Go away on your trip--

57:10.290 --> 57:12.191
- <i>Tell Ronald?</i>
- I don't care.

57:12.192 --> 57:14.593
Have a great time.

57:14.594 --> 57:16.779
Leonard, where
are you going?

57:16.780 --> 57:18.781
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

57:18.782 --> 57:20.783
Oh, Leonard,
don't say that.

57:22.552 --> 57:24.153
Leonard!

57:58.304 --> 58:00.305
Hey, Sandra,
it's Leonard.

58:00.306 --> 58:02.875
Uh, I know it's really early.
You're probably sleeping,

58:02.876 --> 58:05.711
but I was just checking
my schedule and I'm free.

58:05.712 --> 58:09.381
And, yeah-- see about maybe
going out with you to this party.

58:09.382 --> 58:12.085
So why don't you call me
when you get this?

58:12.086 --> 58:15.121
All right.
Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.

58:15.122 --> 58:16.889
Bye.

59:06.840 --> 59:09.759
<i>David, give us a turn.</i>
<i>Give us a turn.</i>

59:09.760 --> 59:12.294
<i>How does he look?</i>

59:12.295 --> 59:14.180
<i>And as our last event</i>
<i>of the day,</i>

59:14.181 --> 59:16.765
<i>I'd like to invite mom,</i>
<i>dad and sister Sandra</i>

59:16.766 --> 59:19.635
<i>to come up and give you support
for your candle-lighting.</i>

59:24.674 --> 59:26.175
<i>We're gonna share the love.</i>

59:26.176 --> 59:27.676
<i>Bring everybody</i>
<i>real close.</i>

59:27.677 --> 59:29.445
<i>Come on in, come around.</i>

59:29.446 --> 59:31.147
<i>Not so close.</i>

59:34.151 --> 59:35.985
<i>It's been such a great</i>
<i>afternoon, everybody.</i>

59:35.986 --> 59:37.420
<i>What a way to</i>
<i>wrap things up.</i>

59:40.790 --> 59:44.227
Our host, dad Michael,
would like to say a few words.

59:44.228 --> 59:46.662
If you could give him a
tremendous round of applause...

59:49.366 --> 59:51.467
Thank you.

59:51.468 --> 59:53.569
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

59:55.606 --> 59:58.774
<i>I just want to say that--</i>
<i>how proud I am</i>

59:58.775 --> 01:00:02.645
That everybody took the time
to come to David's bar mitzvah.

01:00:02.646 --> 01:00:05.814
And on behalf of
your sister Sandra

01:00:05.815 --> 01:00:07.483
and your mother Carol,

01:00:07.484 --> 01:00:10.319
I want to tell you
how proud we are of you.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.323
<i>I just have one question:</i>
<i>With all your gifts,</i>

01:00:14.324 --> 01:00:16.492
Can you make me
a $200 Loan?

01:00:18.328 --> 01:00:20.229
Okay, we're going to
light the last can--

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:21.830
Leonard, come on
up with us.

01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.667
<i>My daughter's boyfriend,
everybody-- come on.</i>

01:00:24.668 --> 01:00:27.136
We're going to light
a candle for David.

01:00:38.182 --> 01:00:40.183
<i>All right, David, at this time</i>

01:00:40.184 --> 01:00:41.917
<i>I'd like you to</i>
<i>close your eyes</i>

01:00:41.918 --> 01:00:43.986
<i>and make a big wish.</i>

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.227
He's very popular.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:54.196
I thought it was on silent.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:00:54.197 --> 01:00:56.999
Help me count, everybody.
Here we go-- one two...

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.201
- Three--
- <i>blow out those candles!</i>

01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:03.739
Ah, <i>mazel tov!</i>

01:01:07.978 --> 01:01:09.679
<i>Last dance, everybody.</i>

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.015
<i>Everybody up for the last dance!</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

01:01:27.097 --> 01:01:29.932
<i>Good night, Leonard.</i>
- Bye.

01:01:36.906 --> 01:01:38.574
<i>Leonard?</i>

01:01:38.575 --> 01:01:41.277
I saw you called me.
What do you want?

01:01:41.278 --> 01:01:42.612
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:01:42.613 --> 01:01:44.463
<i>I know you don't want</i>
<i>to talk to me,</i>

01:01:44.464 --> 01:01:46.766
<i>But I don't-- I don't</i>
<i>know what else to do.</i>

01:01:46.767 --> 01:01:50.136
<i>Um, I'm not</i>
<i>feeling well.</i>

01:01:50.137 --> 01:01:51.653
What's wrong?

01:01:51.654 --> 01:01:54.173
<i>I was supposed to go</i>
<i>to the doctor today.</i>

01:01:54.174 --> 01:01:56.241
<i>I'm-- I'm at home</i>
<i>right now.</i>

01:01:56.242 --> 01:01:59.311
<i>Ron was supposed to take me,
but I don't know where he is.</i>

01:01:59.312 --> 01:02:03.132
<i>I started bleeding really</i>
<i>bad a few hours ago.</i>

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:04.666
You're bleeding?

01:02:04.667 --> 01:02:06.485
<i>I may need to go to</i>
<i>the hospital,</i>

01:02:06.486 --> 01:02:08.654
<i>but I'm afraid</i>
<i>to go by myself.</i>

01:02:08.655 --> 01:02:10.822
<i>Can you come</i>
<i>with me, please?</i>

01:02:10.823 --> 01:02:12.707
Yeah, I'll come.

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.826
<i>Thank you so much,</i>
<i>Leonard.</i>

01:02:31.227 --> 01:02:33.862
<i>Leonard?</i>

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:37.349
<i>Hey.</i> What are you
<i>doing down here?</i>

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.119
What happened?

01:02:45.025 --> 01:02:47.192
I don't feel
very well.

01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:51.730
I'm scared something's
gonna happen.

01:02:52.982 --> 01:02:55.684
Wait here. I'll try
and get us a cab.

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.191
<i>Mr. Kraditor?</i>

01:03:19.192 --> 01:03:20.592
<i>Come.</i>

01:03:32.272 --> 01:03:33.939
Is she awake?

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.941
Yeah.

01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:38.444
<i>But she's still</i>
<i>sedated.</i>

01:03:38.445 --> 01:03:41.347
Mmm, Leonard.

01:03:42.615 --> 01:03:44.183
How you feelin'?

01:03:44.184 --> 01:03:47.987
Is there another blanket?
I'm so cold.

01:03:47.988 --> 01:03:51.290
Yeah, I can feel that.

01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:54.026
Hey, she feels really cold.
Is that normal?

01:03:54.027 --> 01:03:56.361
Yeah, that's typical
from the anesthesia.

01:03:56.362 --> 01:04:01.366
<i>She should be fine. She just needs
to see a doctor in a couple of weeks.</i>

01:04:01.367 --> 01:04:03.435
What'd they do
to her?

01:04:03.436 --> 01:04:05.670
The doctor had to
perform a D. and C.

01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:07.672
She miscarried.

01:04:07.673 --> 01:04:10.943
She wasn't aware she was
pregnant until she came in today.

01:04:18.818 --> 01:04:22.621
They said you're okay
and that's what's important.

01:04:26.593 --> 01:04:28.394
I know.

01:04:46.146 --> 01:04:48.914
Rex, hi.

01:04:48.915 --> 01:04:50.549
Oh, come in.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.852
This is my dog, Rex.

01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:54.386
Oh hi, Rex.

01:04:54.387 --> 01:04:57.022
Oh.

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:59.591
Leonard, I gotta
go lie down.

01:04:59.592 --> 01:05:01.193
Yeah, you should.

01:05:01.194 --> 01:05:03.028
Okay, I'll bring you
the pillows.

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:04.563
Thank you.

01:05:10.837 --> 01:05:13.805
I brought you
some water.

01:05:16.476 --> 01:05:18.110
Thank you, Leonard.

01:05:18.111 --> 01:05:19.778
Feelin' better?

01:05:19.779 --> 01:05:22.047
Good.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:25.383
I had these crazy
nightmares while I was out.

01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:27.385
Yeah?

01:05:27.386 --> 01:05:29.154
Don't worry.

01:05:29.155 --> 01:05:30.856
I am here
to protect you.

01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:32.657
Ow.

01:05:32.658 --> 01:05:34.760
- Don't make me laugh.
- All right.

01:05:34.761 --> 01:05:36.728
Oh, you'll protect me?

01:05:36.729 --> 01:05:38.897
Yeah. I have
a black belt, you know?

01:05:38.898 --> 01:05:39.798
Nightmares--

01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.400
It's fine. Shh.

01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:43.669
Oh, fuck.

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.938
<i>Honey?</i>
- <i>If he sees you, he'll go crazy.</i>

01:05:46.939 --> 01:05:50.809
<i>Hey, what are you
doing, little guy?</i>

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:53.144
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

01:05:53.145 --> 01:05:54.947
Hey.

01:05:54.948 --> 01:05:57.582
Oh hey, sweetheart.

01:05:59.519 --> 01:06:01.353
You didn't call me.

01:06:01.354 --> 01:06:03.422
I'm sorry.
I couldn't.

01:06:03.423 --> 01:06:06.224
My wife was with me all day.
I'm sorry, baby.

01:06:06.225 --> 01:06:09.228
I got here as quick
as I could.

01:06:09.229 --> 01:06:12.064
Today of all days?

01:06:12.065 --> 01:06:15.767
- <i>It's my wife.</i>
- Oh, fuck you.

01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:18.570
<i>She was just with me</i>
<i>all day.</i>

01:06:18.571 --> 01:06:20.372
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:06:20.373 --> 01:06:22.407
I really am sorry.

01:06:22.408 --> 01:06:25.677
<i>I thought about you all day.</i>
<i>It was killing me,</i>

01:06:25.678 --> 01:06:28.013
<i>thinking about you</i>
<i>at the hospital like that.</i>

01:06:29.548 --> 01:06:32.117
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What did the doctor say?</i>

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.752
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:06:33.753 --> 01:06:37.789
Um, I don't feel very well.
I want to be by myself.

01:06:39.258 --> 01:06:41.159
You're not gonna let me
stay with you,

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.928
- even just for a few minutes?
- No.

01:06:42.929 --> 01:06:46.131
I don't want you to stay
with me for a few minutes.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:49.802
Honey, I have to go
to London tomorrow night.

01:06:49.803 --> 01:06:52.771
And then I'm not going to
see you for two weeks.

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.678
I'm sorry.

01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:01.280
I'm sorry.

01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:07.152
I tried to get here
as soon as I could.

01:07:07.153 --> 01:07:09.221
Yeah.

01:07:09.222 --> 01:07:12.157
Come on, baby. Aren't you
going to tell me what's wrong?

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:14.926
Ron, I would
really like it

01:07:14.927 --> 01:07:16.896
if you would just
leave me alone.

01:07:16.897 --> 01:07:18.797
- <i>No, come on--</i>
- Please.

01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:21.099
- <i>Don't be like that.</i>
- Please can you just do that for me?

01:07:36.282 --> 01:07:38.250
Okay, all right.

01:07:43.256 --> 01:07:45.924
Well, I love you
very much,

01:07:45.925 --> 01:07:47.626
more than anything.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.445
That was fucking weird.

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:13.185
<i>Leonard,</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:18.657
All right, I'll--
I'll call you--

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:20.892
No no no no, Leonard,
please don't go.

01:08:20.893 --> 01:08:22.795
Please.

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:24.796
Leonard, could you--

01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:27.131
Will you do me
a favor, please?

01:08:27.133 --> 01:08:29.134
Yeah.

01:08:31.203 --> 01:08:34.171
Could you write something
on my arm with your finger

01:08:34.173 --> 01:08:35.890
while I fall asleep?

01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:39.278
<i>My grandma used to do it</i>
<i>when I was little.</i>

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.216
<i>Mmm.</i>

01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:15.591
<i>...So funny.</i>
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>

01:10:15.592 --> 01:10:19.010
<i>My parents finally got the
pictures back from the bar mitzvah.</i>

01:10:19.011 --> 01:10:22.848
Oh, they-- they like the
dancing shots in the ballroom?

01:10:22.849 --> 01:10:24.816
They love them.

01:10:24.817 --> 01:10:27.102
- Good.
- Thank you, dear.

01:10:27.103 --> 01:10:29.437
You're very welcome.

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:33.609
Um, I got
something for you.

01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:37.329
- A gift?
- Yeah.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:39.147
It's-- you know,
it's winter out, it's cold,

01:10:39.148 --> 01:10:41.683
and I noticed that
you don't wear any gloves.

01:10:41.684 --> 01:10:43.017
Oh, these are nice.

01:10:43.018 --> 01:10:44.603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:44.604 --> 01:10:46.104
You like 'em?

01:10:46.105 --> 01:10:47.772
Yeah, it's got
the stitching.

01:10:47.773 --> 01:10:49.474
I've never seen
anything like this.

01:10:49.475 --> 01:10:50.976
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Little silver thing.

01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:52.761
Good.

01:10:56.799 --> 01:10:58.867
That was very sweet
of you. Thanks.

01:10:58.868 --> 01:11:00.735
No big deal.

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:08.643
What's wrong?
You okay?

01:11:08.644 --> 01:11:09.745
Yeah.

01:11:09.746 --> 01:11:12.180
Yeah, I'm just thinking
about a friend of mine.

01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:14.883
She's kind of going through
some tough stuff, so...

01:11:17.237 --> 01:11:18.870
I don't want you and I
talkin' about it--

01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:20.472
No no,
it's okay.

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:26.578
I love your hands.

01:11:26.579 --> 01:11:29.381
They're so gentle.

01:11:36.289 --> 01:11:38.724
<i>I hate these</i>
<i>fucking scars.</i>

01:11:41.177 --> 01:11:44.129
Leonard, I, um...

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.649
I want to take care
of you.

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:49.818
I feel like I
understand you.

01:11:49.819 --> 01:11:51.536
You're different.

01:11:51.537 --> 01:11:54.322
You don't pretend to be
something you're not.

01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:57.876
So you don't have to
worry about anything.

01:11:57.877 --> 01:11:59.878
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

01:11:59.879 --> 01:12:02.347
Thank you.

01:12:02.348 --> 01:12:05.066
You know, I got
a lot of stuff

01:12:05.067 --> 01:12:08.120
going on
right now that's...

01:12:10.707 --> 01:12:12.791
I don't even know what
it's like to just

01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:14.876
be myself right now.

01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:16.944
No, I-- I understand.

01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:24.236
Are you in a hurry
somewhere or what?

01:12:24.237 --> 01:12:25.937
No, I just wanted to
pay the check

01:12:25.938 --> 01:12:27.539
so we could
get out of here.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.141
Okay.

01:12:29.142 --> 01:12:31.643
Oh, fuck.

01:12:31.644 --> 01:12:34.646
Probably my father calling:
"How's the date?"

01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:39.551
Uh, I gotta take this.
Yeah, it's my friend.

01:12:39.552 --> 01:12:41.553
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be right back.

01:12:41.554 --> 01:12:43.554
Sorry.
We'll go in a minute.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.161
- Michelle?
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:52.981
- Hey.
- <i>I just got your text from yesterday.</i>

01:12:52.982 --> 01:12:55.917
Yeah, well, I knew you had your
two-week follow-up thing today.

01:12:55.918 --> 01:12:57.402
How'd it go?

01:12:57.403 --> 01:13:00.371
It went fine. Everything's--
everything's good.

01:13:00.372 --> 01:13:01.773
The doctor says I'm good.

01:13:01.774 --> 01:13:03.008
Good.

01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:04.575
'Cause I didn't
hear from you.

01:13:04.576 --> 01:13:07.029
No, I'm fine. I just
came home and got into bed

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:08.613
and I've been lazy.

01:13:08.614 --> 01:13:10.732
<i>Listen, Leonard,</i>

01:13:10.733 --> 01:13:13.218
<i>Ron got back</i>
<i>from London today.</i>

01:13:13.219 --> 01:13:15.537
<i>I decided I'm going to</i>
<i>go to his office later</i>

01:13:15.538 --> 01:13:18.673
<i>and I'm just--</i>
<i>I'm just gonna end it.</i>

01:13:18.674 --> 01:13:20.809
Really?
Today?

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.427
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:13:22.428 --> 01:13:25.163
<i>I've been thinking about what
you said and you were right.</i>

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:27.882
<i>Nothing's going</i>
<i>to change.</i>

01:13:27.883 --> 01:13:30.618
It's not fair what
he's doing, you know?

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:34.522
It's not fair to me and it's
definitely not fair to his family.

01:13:34.523 --> 01:13:38.059
<i>He still doesn't even know what
happened to me at the hospital.</i>

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.296
Well, do you want me to come
with you and wait outside or--

01:13:41.297 --> 01:13:44.198
<i>No, don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll be strong.</i>

01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:46.367
<i>Just wish me luck.</i>

01:13:46.368 --> 01:13:47.953
Well, good luck.

01:13:47.954 --> 01:13:50.956
<i>Thanks. </i> I'll text you
<i>after it's over, all right?</i>

01:13:50.957 --> 01:13:52.624
Okay. Bye.

01:13:58.397 --> 01:14:01.382
<i>I haven't seen units</i>
<i>like that in 30 years.</i>

01:14:01.383 --> 01:14:03.969
They're ancient.
We gotta get something new.

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:06.655
<i>There are some new</i>
<i>Italian machines</i>

01:14:06.656 --> 01:14:08.373
- <i>they're Tintoretto.</i>
- <i>Tintoretto?</i>

01:14:08.374 --> 01:14:10.475
- <i>Yeah, Tintoretto.</i>
- <i>Leonard?</i>

01:14:10.476 --> 01:14:11.676
Hey, pop.

01:14:11.677 --> 01:14:13.578
Leonard.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.797
Mr. Cohen.

01:14:15.798 --> 01:14:18.299
Reuben, I'm going to
take off. We'll talk.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.035
All right.

01:14:20.036 --> 01:14:22.203
I'm glad I
caught you, Leonard.

01:14:22.204 --> 01:14:25.406
- Listen, tomorrow...
- Yeah?

01:14:25.407 --> 01:14:28.710
...Do you think you could come
by my office, above my cleaners?

01:14:28.711 --> 01:14:31.780
- Yeah.
- I got something I'd like to talk to you about.

01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:33.614
- How's noon?
- Uh...

01:14:33.615 --> 01:14:35.483
Well, I think I have
to work tomorrow.

01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:37.018
Go-- go meet
with Michael.

01:14:37.019 --> 01:14:38.887
- The deliveries...
- It's okay.

01:14:38.888 --> 01:14:40.372
Okay. Good.

01:14:40.373 --> 01:14:42.123
I'll see you then.

01:14:42.124 --> 01:14:44.109
Reuben.

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.444
I'll bring a nice bottle
of champagne for--

01:14:46.445 --> 01:14:48.713
Oh, no,
we got plenty.

01:14:48.714 --> 01:14:50.015
No, it's my pleasure.

01:14:50.016 --> 01:14:51.216
- Yes, all right.
- Okay.

01:14:51.217 --> 01:14:52.550
- Okay.
- I'll see you at noon.

01:14:52.551 --> 01:14:54.052
All right.

01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:57.072
Bye bye.

01:14:57.073 --> 01:14:58.706
<i>Hey, pop,</i>
<i>where's mom?</i>

01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:01.576
- <i>There's no more Seltzer.</i>
- She's out getting stuff.

01:15:01.577 --> 01:15:05.897
<i>She's having another one of her famous
New Year's parties tomorrow night.</i>

01:15:12.321 --> 01:15:14.489
How are you?

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.493
Are you happy
these days?

01:15:18.494 --> 01:15:20.294
I'm okay.

01:15:20.295 --> 01:15:23.081
I feel anxious.

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:24.515
I'm okay.

01:15:26.518 --> 01:15:30.204
I was just talking to--
to Michael.

01:15:30.205 --> 01:15:32.607
I want to make sure
you'll be taken care of

01:15:32.608 --> 01:15:34.675
with the merger
and all this.

01:15:34.676 --> 01:15:38.329
It's why I'm doing it,
so you have a future.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:41.466
You'll have
your health insurance.

01:15:42.835 --> 01:15:44.920
I appreciate that,
Pop.

01:15:49.408 --> 01:15:53.010
I'm going swimming in the ocean
with Polar Bear Club

01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:54.646
On New Year's day.

01:15:54.647 --> 01:15:57.165
Be careful
out there.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:59.434
I will.

01:16:01.053 --> 01:16:03.988
What? Somebody is sending
you something here?

01:16:06.225 --> 01:16:09.176
Yeah, it's just
my friend.

01:16:09.177 --> 01:16:12.113
All right.
I forgot to do something.

01:16:12.114 --> 01:16:14.716
I'll clean this up
later, all right?

01:16:39.608 --> 01:16:41.109
Hey.

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.144
I just got
your text.

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:45.179
I've been worried
about you.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.698
You all right?

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:50.618
It's over.
I did it.

01:16:53.289 --> 01:16:56.858
He yelled and screamed
but I did it.

01:16:56.859 --> 01:16:58.960
Sorry.

01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:01.096
It's so fucked up.

01:17:04.633 --> 01:17:07.035
I'm so lost, Leonard.

01:17:10.256 --> 01:17:13.425
I have this friend
in San Francisco.

01:17:13.426 --> 01:17:16.794
She's going away for a while
and she said I could

01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:19.831
go out and stay at
her place.

01:17:19.832 --> 01:17:22.233
So I'm gonna go out there

01:17:22.234 --> 01:17:24.235
and figure things out.

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:30.892
Don't go.

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:39.467
I love you.

01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:44.372
I do.

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:45.890
Oh, God.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.678
Leonard--

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:52.413
I know you may not
want to hear it,

01:17:52.414 --> 01:17:53.965
but it's true.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.852
Leonard, you don't
love me, okay?

01:17:57.853 --> 01:18:00.088
- Don't say that.
- I'm completely fucked up.

01:18:00.089 --> 01:18:02.123
Don't say that.
I'm not a little kid.

01:18:02.124 --> 01:18:05.826
This isn't some
stupid fucking crush.

01:18:05.827 --> 01:18:09.097
You think I don't
know love?

01:18:09.098 --> 01:18:11.416
I was supposed to
get married.

01:18:11.417 --> 01:18:14.102
Her parents are the ones
that called it off

01:18:14.103 --> 01:18:16.454
because of
this medical thing and...

01:18:19.391 --> 01:18:21.509
then she went away.

01:18:25.147 --> 01:18:27.415
I couldn't find her.

01:18:30.986 --> 01:18:34.572
And I tried to hurt myself and
they put me in the hospital.

01:18:34.573 --> 01:18:36.724
And I--

01:18:38.594 --> 01:18:41.329
I didn't--

01:18:44.032 --> 01:18:46.734
I didn't think that
I'd ever

01:18:46.735 --> 01:18:49.053
love anyone again.

01:18:54.593 --> 01:18:56.978
And I lov--
I love you.

01:18:56.979 --> 01:18:58.747
I do.

01:19:02.184 --> 01:19:03.951
Leonard, I...

01:19:07.323 --> 01:19:09.908
You--

01:19:09.909 --> 01:19:12.743
You think if I got to know
you that I wouldn't love you,

01:19:12.744 --> 01:19:16.130
but I do know you and
I love you even more.

01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.433
I understand you,
Michelle.

01:19:18.434 --> 01:19:20.734
I'm fucked up too.

01:19:26.341 --> 01:19:30.061
I will never
walk away from you.

01:19:30.062 --> 01:19:31.462
Never.

01:19:32.798 --> 01:19:36.917
He left you.
I'd never do that.

01:19:36.918 --> 01:19:39.204
I'll take care
of you

01:19:40.589 --> 01:19:43.692
because that's
what you deserve.

01:19:43.693 --> 01:19:46.144
You deserve
to be loved.

01:19:50.382 --> 01:19:53.984
And maybe you'll
learn to love me too.

01:20:35.027 --> 01:20:36.360
Ahh!

01:20:56.115 --> 01:20:58.049
I love you.

01:21:21.373 --> 01:21:23.240
Oh.

01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:25.276
You're so beautiful.

01:21:26.679 --> 01:21:28.780
You're so beautiful.

01:22:18.647 --> 01:22:20.214
Hi.

01:22:23.018 --> 01:22:24.953
That was beautiful.

01:22:24.954 --> 01:22:26.754
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:28.707 --> 01:22:31.876
You know what
I just realized?

01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:34.279
I never really
saw you.

01:22:36.298 --> 01:22:38.582
I never saw you
either.

01:22:40.986 --> 01:22:44.321
I can feel you, you know?
I can really feel you.

01:22:44.322 --> 01:22:46.257
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:52.864 --> 01:22:54.865
Can you see me now?

01:22:54.866 --> 01:22:56.617
<i>Yes.</i>

01:22:59.888 --> 01:23:02.290
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

01:23:09.464 --> 01:23:14.402
You're the most beautiful,
most amazing woman ever.

01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:25.863
What are we
gonna do, Leonard?

01:23:27.465 --> 01:23:29.750
I can't stay here.

01:23:29.751 --> 01:23:33.504
He's not gonna keep
paying for this apartment.

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:36.190
<i>And I think I've really</i>
<i>got to go to San Francisco.</i>

01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:38.259
Then I'll just
go with you.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.645
Are you serious?

01:23:40.646 --> 01:23:42.680
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:42.681 --> 01:23:44.915
I told you, Michelle,
I love you.

01:23:47.319 --> 01:23:49.387
I'll do anything for you.

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:54.208
Do you really
love me, Leonard?

01:23:54.209 --> 01:23:55.776
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:55.777 --> 01:23:58.329
Michelle,
let's just go.

01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.914
Tomorrow.

01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:03.251
Yeah.

01:24:03.252 --> 01:24:05.152
Fuck it,
let's just go.

01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:07.054
Let's just get
the fuck out of here.

01:24:07.055 --> 01:24:09.607
<i>Yeah, fuck it.</i>
<i>I've got no reason to stay here.</i>

01:24:09.608 --> 01:24:12.177
I just want to be with you,
wherever that is.

01:24:12.178 --> 01:24:14.712
I don't care.

01:24:14.713 --> 01:24:17.348
You're crazy.

01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:19.434
That's what
they told me.

01:24:19.435 --> 01:24:22.169
<i>All right, I'm gonna</i>
<i>work on the tickets.</i>

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:24.872
You don't worry
about anything, okay?

01:24:24.873 --> 01:24:26.307
I'll call you
in a little bit.

01:24:26.308 --> 01:24:28.108
Okay.

01:24:28.109 --> 01:24:30.144
I love you.

01:24:30.145 --> 01:24:31.946
<i>Okay.</i>

01:24:31.947 --> 01:24:34.214
Okay.
Bye for now.

01:24:37.852 --> 01:24:39.720
<i>Bye.</i>

01:24:39.721 --> 01:24:41.239
Good night.

01:25:03.845 --> 01:25:06.430
<i>Leonard?</i>

01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:09.116
Have you ever seen
"Benny Hill"?

01:25:09.117 --> 01:25:12.019
<i>I just got the new</i>
<i>DVD set.</i>

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.771
Yeah, he's good, Pop.

01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:17.475
What are you doing,
Leonard?

01:25:17.476 --> 01:25:21.011
Just looking at some stuff
online, Mom.

01:25:34.143 --> 01:25:37.345
What are you doing?
Do you need help?

01:25:37.346 --> 01:25:39.931
No no, thanks.
I got it.

01:26:39.324 --> 01:26:41.925
<i>This is the best we
have at this price.</i>

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.582
I just want it
to be right, you know?

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:50.785
Of all the rings,

01:26:50.786 --> 01:26:54.505
I-I think this is
the best choice.

01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:04.865
Yeah, it's nice.

01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:09.853
I want it.

01:27:09.854 --> 01:27:11.522
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

01:27:11.523 --> 01:27:13.607
You'll be using
a credit card?

01:27:13.608 --> 01:27:15.993
Cash.

01:27:15.994 --> 01:27:18.028
I'll get you
your receipt.

01:27:18.029 --> 01:27:20.748
Thank you.
Seven...

01:27:20.749 --> 01:27:23.067
<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>I got our tickets.</i>

01:27:23.068 --> 01:27:25.469
I'm packed and ready to go.
Is everything good with you?

01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.205
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>everything's fine.</i>

01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:29.440
<i>I called my girlfriend</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

01:27:29.441 --> 01:27:31.275
- <i>I'm excited.</i>
- Me too.

01:27:31.276 --> 01:27:34.378
So, listen, meet me in the
courtyard at 8:00, all right?

01:27:34.379 --> 01:27:36.747
I got us a car to take us
to the airport.

01:27:36.748 --> 01:27:38.415
- 8:00.
- <i>All right.</i>

01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:40.684
<i>I'll-- I'll definitely</i>
<i>be there.</i>

01:27:40.685 --> 01:27:42.386
I can't wait to
see you.

01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.388
- <i>Me too.</i>
- Oh, one other thing.

01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:46.290
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I got you a surprise.

01:27:46.291 --> 01:27:48.125
<i>A surprise?</i>
<i>What'd you get me?</i>

01:27:48.126 --> 01:27:50.794
Uh, it wouldn't be
a surprise if I told you!

01:27:50.795 --> 01:27:53.664
<i>My God.</i>
<i>You are so weird.</i>

01:27:53.665 --> 01:27:55.532
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

01:27:55.533 --> 01:27:57.034
Okay, bye.

01:27:57.035 --> 01:27:58.870
<i>Bye.</i>

01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:03.374
<i>I'm glad you could make it in</i>
<i>today for our meeting, Leonard.</i>

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:05.576
<i>Just take a look</i>
<i>around the business,</i>

01:28:05.577 --> 01:28:07.711
<i>acquaint yourself with</i>
<i>what's going on here.</i>

01:28:07.712 --> 01:28:12.399
A kid's got to start thinking
about his future sometime.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.217
Oh, I do.

01:28:14.218 --> 01:28:18.189
Well, this is your opportunity
right here, right now.

01:28:18.190 --> 01:28:20.090
<i>It could be</i>
<i>a terrific thing--</i>

01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:22.526
<i>A fresh start for</i>
<i>you and Sandra.</i>

01:28:22.527 --> 01:28:25.780
<i>My daughter</i>
<i>is crazy about you.</i>

01:28:25.781 --> 01:28:28.815
<i>And believe me, there's
lots of guys after her.</i>

01:28:28.816 --> 01:28:31.969
The most important thing is
to give her what she wants

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:34.421
because she is
my life.

01:28:34.422 --> 01:28:37.007
So I'm going to ask you
a question now.

01:28:37.008 --> 01:28:39.660
<i>And I'm going to</i>
<i>be direct with you.</i>

01:28:39.661 --> 01:28:41.462
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

01:28:44.315 --> 01:28:45.983
Are you a fuck-up?

01:28:48.537 --> 01:28:50.387
I don't think so.

01:28:50.388 --> 01:28:54.225
You-- you know why I'm asking
you this question, right?

01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:57.778
Well, I think it's
'cause of Sandra.

01:28:57.779 --> 01:29:00.581
<i>It's Sandra</i>
<i>and the merger.</i>

01:29:00.582 --> 01:29:02.767
This is a terrific
thing for you,

01:29:02.768 --> 01:29:04.335
a terrific thing,

01:29:04.336 --> 01:29:06.003
<i>to turn your life</i>
<i>around.</i>

01:29:06.004 --> 01:29:07.221
I understand that.

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:09.240
<i>This business is</i>
<i>important to me.</i>

01:29:09.241 --> 01:29:12.993
Your father has a hell of
a good location out there.

01:29:12.994 --> 01:29:15.629
<i>And we're going to be</i>
<i>moving into that space soon.</i>

01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:19.116
<i>And when we do, there is</i>
<i>an opportunity here</i>

01:29:19.117 --> 01:29:21.518
<i>for you, for your father,</i>
<i>for your family,</i>

01:29:21.519 --> 01:29:23.170
<i>for your future family,</i>

01:29:23.171 --> 01:29:26.674
If you apply yourself,
and I know you're going to.

01:29:26.675 --> 01:29:30.310
I think you know how important
this is for everybody.

01:29:30.311 --> 01:29:32.012
Yes.

01:29:33.381 --> 01:29:35.365
Good. Good.

01:29:40.121 --> 01:29:42.189
What's in the bag?

01:29:43.875 --> 01:29:45.609
Just...

01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:48.379
It's a surprise.
It's a gift.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.247
- Oh.
- <i>It's a secret.</i>

01:29:50.248 --> 01:29:52.300
Yeah, big secret.

01:29:52.301 --> 01:29:54.518
Okay, so I'll
see you tonight, right?

01:29:54.519 --> 01:29:56.270
Uh-huh, yeah,
at the party.

01:29:56.271 --> 01:29:58.522
<i>We're gonna celebrate</i>
<i>New Year's together.</i>

01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:01.225
I'm about to have lunch.
Do you want to have lunch with me?

01:30:01.226 --> 01:30:04.595
No, I've got to go do some
shopping for my mom for the party.

01:30:04.596 --> 01:30:06.080
- Okay.
- <i>All right.</i>

01:30:06.081 --> 01:30:07.348
Good.

01:30:07.349 --> 01:30:09.083
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay, Leonard.

01:30:09.084 --> 01:30:11.218
- Thanks for coming.
- Bye.

01:30:13.521 --> 01:30:15.022
<i>You know, we celebrate--</i>

01:30:15.023 --> 01:30:18.809
<i>we celebrate the New Year</i>
<i>twice a year, you know?</i>

01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:21.345
Because at
Rosh Hashanah and...

01:30:21.346 --> 01:30:23.380
- All right, it's good.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:30:23.381 --> 01:30:25.182
It's a 1998.

01:30:25.183 --> 01:30:27.184
- '98?
- 1998.

01:30:29.421 --> 01:30:30.754
It's really very good.

01:30:30.755 --> 01:30:33.457
I go there, and they
have a theater with--

01:30:33.458 --> 01:30:35.026
For my princess.

01:30:35.027 --> 01:30:37.395
Thank you.

01:30:37.396 --> 01:30:39.730
<i>Hey, Reuben,</i>
<i>you sure we got enough?</i>

01:30:39.731 --> 01:30:42.599
We've got this to last
until midnight.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.601
We are in
a good shape, huh?

01:30:44.602 --> 01:30:46.803
Good.

01:30:46.804 --> 01:30:49.457
Reuben, why don't you
ask Leonard

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.892
- to help you with that?
- All right.

01:30:53.261 --> 01:30:55.729
He's trying to open a box--
did you see that?--

01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:57.631
With a plastic spoon.

01:30:59.401 --> 01:31:01.602
- Enjoying?
- Having a great time.

01:31:03.138 --> 01:31:05.806
<i>Leonard, could you</i>
<i>help me for a minute?</i>

01:31:05.807 --> 01:31:07.541
<i>I need to open</i>
<i>everything up.</i>

01:31:07.542 --> 01:31:09.110
Be right out, Pop.

01:31:36.854 --> 01:31:38.955
Hey, Lenny, you still
taking all those pictures?

01:31:38.956 --> 01:31:40.724
Hey.

01:31:40.725 --> 01:31:43.494
Leonard, can you help me
with this, please?

01:31:46.364 --> 01:31:48.365
<i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hi, Reuben.</i>

01:31:48.366 --> 01:31:50.367
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>I hope we're not late.</i>

01:31:50.368 --> 01:31:53.437
<i>No, it's okay.</i>
<i>Come on in.</i>

01:31:53.438 --> 01:31:55.439
The Cohens are on
their way up.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.175
- Oh, yeah?
- Sandra is with them.

01:31:58.176 --> 01:31:59.910
Happy New Year, Pop.

01:31:59.911 --> 01:32:01.912
Happy New Year.

01:32:01.913 --> 01:32:04.214
- Leonard! You look so good.
- Yeah?

01:32:04.215 --> 01:32:06.650
- Oh, thank you. It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:32:25.236 --> 01:32:27.137
Will you both hurry up?

01:32:28.823 --> 01:32:31.892
- Hi!
- <i>Happy New Year to you.</i>

01:32:31.893 --> 01:32:33.877
<i>Hi!</i>
<i>There's lots of food.</i>

01:32:33.878 --> 01:32:37.932
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
- <i>I'll be right back.</i>

01:32:37.933 --> 01:32:39.950
Leonard?

01:32:40.919 --> 01:32:42.369
Are you leaving?

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.893
I saw on the computer that you
checked travel sites last night.

01:32:52.463 --> 01:32:54.765
<i>You're going</i>
<i>with her?</i>

01:32:54.766 --> 01:32:56.967
Yes.

01:33:06.728 --> 01:33:09.163
I have to go, Mom.

01:33:09.164 --> 01:33:12.015
But you don't even
have a bag.

01:33:12.016 --> 01:33:14.818
I threw it
out the window.

01:33:17.622 --> 01:33:20.707
You don't have to
worry about me.

01:33:20.708 --> 01:33:22.843
I'm gonna be okay.

01:33:34.622 --> 01:33:36.640
I love you
very much.

01:33:38.677 --> 01:33:41.044
I know you do.

01:33:41.045 --> 01:33:42.946
This is your home.

01:33:42.947 --> 01:33:45.682
You come back here
whenever you want. Mmm?

01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:51.188
Tell Papa that
I'm sorry.

01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:55.809
And I hope I didn't
mess things up.

01:33:55.810 --> 01:33:58.428
And that I'm happy.

01:33:58.429 --> 01:34:00.998
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

01:34:02.317 --> 01:34:04.852
We want you happy.

01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:06.286
I love you.

01:34:06.287 --> 01:34:08.222
Thanks, Mom.

01:34:08.223 --> 01:34:10.190
I have to go.

01:34:47.779 --> 01:34:50.013
Uh, Michelle,
it's Leonard.

01:34:50.014 --> 01:34:53.183
I'm downstairs.
It's 8:05.

01:34:53.184 --> 01:34:55.252
Call me or I'll see you
down here. All right.

01:34:55.253 --> 01:34:56.420
Bye.

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.961
Please come.

01:35:41.233 --> 01:35:43.049
Please come down.

01:36:12.213 --> 01:36:14.564
I was just calling you.

01:36:14.565 --> 01:36:16.867
The car's out front
waiting.

01:36:20.438 --> 01:36:22.139
I'm not going.

01:36:25.126 --> 01:36:27.194
<i>I'm not going.</i>

01:36:28.563 --> 01:36:31.598
He left his family
for me.

01:36:31.599 --> 01:36:35.051
He told
his wife everything.

01:36:35.052 --> 01:36:38.272
He says he wants
to get married.

01:36:38.273 --> 01:36:42.593
<i>I finally let him know</i>
<i>about my miscarriage</i>

01:36:42.594 --> 01:36:44.761
<i>and that really</i>
<i>changed things for him.</i>

01:36:47.299 --> 01:36:49.166
<i>Leonard,</i>

01:36:49.167 --> 01:36:52.586
You're such
a wonderful person.

01:36:52.587 --> 01:36:54.921
<i>But he left them for me.</i>

01:36:54.922 --> 01:36:58.359
<i>You know, I've got to</i>
<i>give it a chance.</i>

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.729
<i>I feel like if I wasn't</i>
<i>with Ronald,</i>

01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:03.930
<i>we could...</i>

01:37:05.316 --> 01:37:08.852
