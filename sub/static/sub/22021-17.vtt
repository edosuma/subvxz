00:01.084 --> 00:02.540
[Hannah] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.878
The power grids are down.
There's a signature embedded in this hack

00:06.006 --> 00:08.122
that's similar to the space station
and prison hacks.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.920
-[Lyor] This is Greg Bowen.
-[Gregory] I'm working for Chairman Kim.

00:11.053 --> 00:14.717
You don't care which table you're at,
as long as someone else foots the bill.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.465
-There's a dirty bomb in the US?
-Yes, sir.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.636
They wanted camera crews.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.056
They wanted a big civilian target.
It's in the subway.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.351
[Foerstel] I've still got men down there!
[shouting] Get back! Get everybody back!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.312
[people screaming]

00:27.444 --> 00:28.309
John?

00:28.445 --> 00:32.154
Six federal agents gave their lives
to protect us from this terrible attack,

00:32.281 --> 00:34.774
including John Foerstel,
the director of the FBI.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.493
We have irrefutable evidence
your country was behind the bombing.

00:37.621 --> 00:41.080
Bank transfers.
From Kunami state accounts to the bomber.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.243
We were attacked!

00:42.376 --> 00:43.787
The protocol is strike back!

00:43.919 --> 00:44.784
At your command, sir.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.502
Do it.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.461
[indistinct chatter over PA]

00:53.136 --> 00:57.425
My fellow Americans,
yesterday I addressed you from this office

00:57.558 --> 00:59.640
with a promise to hunt down
those behind the bomb

00:59.768 --> 01:03.477
that exploded at Brandt metro station
and killed six federal agents.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.849
We have identified the Emirate of Kunami
as the country responsible.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.818
Accordingly, at 7:52 p.m. last night,

01:10.946 --> 01:15.031
| authorized missile strikes
on strategic targets throughout Kunami.

01:15.158 --> 01:19.026
Those strikes will continue
until the emir surrenders unconditionally.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.664
This is where he has to sell it.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.200
-He will.
-He better.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.447
[Tom] When the Capitol was bombed,

01:23.584 --> 01:27.498
| swore an oath to protect this country
against further aggression.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.002
The dirty bomb was a declaration of war
by a foreign nation.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.751
And it is a war this country will win.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.547
God bless you.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.513
And God bless
these United States of America.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.344
[cameraman] And we're out.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.974
Mr. President, you... you called it a war.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.892
| know I did. Because that's what it is.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.392
[Emily] Veterans organizations are coming up
with statements of support, sir.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.144
Senator Grassman says
Foreign Relations wants a briefing.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.898
The whole world is gonna want one,
'cause the word "war" is a signifier.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.901
It creates expectations
of protracted involvement and loss of life.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.823
Lyor, lives have been lost:

02:01.955 --> 02:03.992
six federal agents,
including the head of our FBI,

02:04.124 --> 02:05.239
and we know who did it.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.084
I'm not gonna spin this as targeted action
or proportionate response.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.499
What these people did to us
was an act of war.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.373
| simply answered the call.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.091
-[Blakey] We're getting nowhere.
-[Hannah] Okay, let's back up.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.678
Someone was running our bomber, Arturo Rojas.
We need to find out who.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.092
In the two days before the bombing,

02:21.224 --> 02:24.592
we have Rojas on video at a gas station
in Vienna, Virginia,

02:24.728 --> 02:25.968
the Baltimore Harbor,

02:26.688 --> 02:30.602
and the Clareview Hotel in Congress Heights,
where he had a room he paid cash for.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.323
What is that?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.856
Right there, freeze that.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.074
-Where's he going?
-[Chuck] Bathroom.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.534
How long does he spend in there?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.326
[Chuck] Time stamp says 14 minutes.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.249
That's 13 minutes longer than I would.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.040
Can you freeze the faces of the people
who got there after him?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.246
[typing]

02:57.427 --> 02:59.714
[Blakey] That guy was in there for what?
Ten minutes?

03:01.098 --> 03:03.556
Enlarging his profile
and sharpening his image.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.019
Gregory Bowen?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.769
The East Hun Chiu political advisor?
That doesn't make sense.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.688
Yes, it does.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.898
The worst kind of sense.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.820
No warrant?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.072
I'm calling a lawyer
and suing for false imprisonment.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.245
You might want to call a priest,

03:30.377 --> 03:32.414
because we know
you were working for Kunami.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.334
Which means you're a coconspirator
in the murder of federal agents.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.299
You're mistaken. I'm a paid advisor
to Chairman Kim of East Hun Chiu.

03:39.428 --> 03:43.467
You have five seconds to save your life, Greg,
or we're ringing you up for capital murder.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.731
Wait.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.309
| was acting at the specific behest
of the emir.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.273
-Which makes me a prisoner of war.
-We'll talk about your status later.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.991
Now, we need a list of your coconspirators.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.280
Arturo Rojas was the only one.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.282
[Hannah] That's not enough
to get you out of this.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.001
But if you'd like to convince a jury
you're an enemy combatant

04:14.129 --> 04:15.369
and not an accomplice to murder,

04:15.505 --> 04:17.087
you could try that.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.666
What if I could give you something?
A name.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.009
What kind of name?

04:23.138 --> 04:27.052
One that would avoid years of
US involvement in a war it can't win.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.721
A leader that the president can support.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.811
The rebel leader Amal Hamzi.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.351
Amal Hamzi disappeared two years ago. He's dead.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.020
No. He's in hiding.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.194
And I can tell you where to find him.

04:41.990 --> 04:46.029
You were hired by Chairman Kim,
whom you then framed for Kunami.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.994
Now you're telling us
you know where an opposition figure

04:49.122 --> 04:51.329
that the emir would like to have
decapitated is hiding?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.244
Tell me, how does that work?

04:53.376 --> 04:56.539
I'm a businessman, Agent Wells.
| like to keep my options open.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.924
No. You're a snake who'd
sell your mother out for bus fare.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.381
And you did all of this for money.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.042
All of it.

05:03.178 --> 05:06.421
People are dead, and it's not even
because of something you believe in.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.345
-Do we have a deal or not?
-No, we don't!

05:10.477 --> 05:11.763
Not until you do something for me.

05:11.895 --> 05:15.229
You're gonna say the name of the FBI director,
John Foerstel.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.732
He was my friend. [gun cocks]
And you helped murder him.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.191
- I never met the man.
-[Hannah] Say his name.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.981
-Hannah.
-Say it!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.571
[nervously] John Foerstel.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.741
Now start writing.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.704
[theme music playing]

05:39.589 --> 05:41.205
[Neil] Seth, how long will this take?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.208
As I've been saying all week, Neil,
there is no timetable.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.382
The strikes will continue until
all the military objectives have been met,

05:47.514 --> 05:49.721
-including the surrender of the emir.
-[reporters clamoring]

05:49.850 --> 05:51.636
But the emir
and his command are in hiding.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.386
-You're fighting a guerrilla army now.
-Is there a question?

05:55.522 --> 05:59.311
-[reporter] Will ground troops be sent?
-All military options are on the table. Carla.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.774
Is the president confident
of public support

06:01.903 --> 06:03.314
for a prolonged conflict?

06:03.446 --> 06:05.824
[Seth] Yeah, look,
83% of the American public

06:05.949 --> 06:07.565
support the President's handling of this war.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.988
-So, we're looking at a united front.
-[reporters clamoring]

06:10.120 --> 06:11.906
[thudding on glass]

06:13.540 --> 06:14.575
Problem?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.949
This stupid thing took my money.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.002
| think it's supposed to do that.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.462
And cough up something in return.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.629
[clatters]

06:32.392 --> 06:33.598
Thanks, Mike. [chuckles]

06:36.313 --> 06:39.271
Uh, you were Special Forces, right?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.433
In a previous life.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.564
My brother Royce is, too.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.490
| haven't heard from him
since this Kunami thing kicked off.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.985
Radio silence is par for the course.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.236
'Cause all the teams have to prep
for possible deployment.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.490
Doesn't mean he's going anywhere.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.624
| thought as much.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.335
Just not used to being out of touch.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.829
[Mike] What's Royce's branch of service?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.707
Navy. SEAL Team Three.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.551
Those guys can take care of themselves.
| wouldn't worry.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.922
If that thing starts acting up again,
send up a flare.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.304
- I know how to sweet-talk it.
-Thanks, Mike.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.724
[Covell] Satellite imagery has confirmed

07:23.860 --> 07:26.648
rebel leader Amal Hamzi
is on Kunami's western border.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.147
No way to get word to him
that we will back him

07:29.282 --> 07:31.660
-with logistical and financial support?
-No, ma'am, he's incommunicado,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.992
which is why we have to do things
the old way.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.407
A presidential emissary, Agent Hannah Wells.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.075
Who will be escorted by a squad

07:38.208 --> 07:40.199
from SEAL Team Three,
who are already in country.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.373
If the mission fails,
we need to consider other options fast.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.711
Secretary Wooster's right.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.548
We'll have to inform the American people
that soldiers died in battle on foreign soil.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.008
Deaths at home and abroad?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.345
-Sir, the public will bay for blood.
-And more soldiers.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.340
| didn't authorize this mission
because I thought it would fail.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.218
Having said that,
I'd like to review your plan again

07:59.354 --> 08:00.890
for a major ground offensive.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.013
Our soldiers would need to be ready
in 72 hours.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.105
[Covell] Yes, Mr. President.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.726
Sir, congressional leadership
is waiting in the Truman Room.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.192
Thank you. That'll be all for now.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.240
A SEAL team
only the president wanted inserted?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.405
Why invade a country
if we're winning from the air?

08:15.537 --> 08:18.120
We're not. We're weakening
the enemy's resolve.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.615
-Which is winning.
-And Special Forces is not an invasion.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.038
No, it's just a prelude to one.
Aaron, talk sense to him.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.036
What should I say?
Lyor doesn't like the optics?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.630
What I don't like is war.
The longer this goes on,

08:28.758 --> 08:31.216
the more likely the president's mandate
will be a casualty.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.880
Our job is to prevent that.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.880
-My job is coordinating military policy.
-Guys...

08:36.015 --> 08:38.974
| haven't figured out
what the hell do you do here.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.342
| make everyone look good.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.554
- I should charge you double.
-Hey, guys!

08:43.690 --> 08:46.899
Seriously, we're on a war footing.
Forward march together.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.532
[SEAL team leader] Okay, Agent Wells,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.656
we're 13 clicks
from rebel leader Amal Hamzi's camp.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.454
We'll take the mountain pass
to keep us out of eyeshot.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.749
We meet our guide, Rami Bashir,
at this creek

09:08.298 --> 09:10.380
-and go from there.
-[Hannah] Lead on, captain.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.091
-[SEAL team leader] Let's move out.
-[SEAL team member 1] Yes, sir.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.593
[SEAL team member 2]
Movement, 11 o'clock.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.102
[indistinct shouting]

09:25.148 --> 09:26.638
[guns firing]

09:29.986 --> 09:31.772
[SEAL team leader] Suppressing fire!

09:32.280 --> 09:34.271
Move forward in team!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.316
We're being flanked.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.407
[door opens]

09:45.543 --> 09:47.125
-Trey.
-Hey.

09:48.004 --> 09:48.789
What a nice surprise.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.381
My trip to the Bay Area got postponed.
Want to have lunch?

09:52.509 --> 09:56.298
-Although, probably not a good time.
-For me, there's no such thing.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.806
You gotta take what you can get.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.343
I'll have the kitchen send something up.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.508
| really want to try California condor.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.725
Not gonna happen.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.809
Spotted owl?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.350
You're gonna get an Angus burger
and you're gonna like it.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.473
-How you doing?
-Well, we're at war.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.068
I've got a budget deficit
and a hacking crisis that I can't solve.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.186
Heavy lies the head.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.859
My crown seems to only have thorns.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.608
-Keeping up with therapy?
-Yeah, twice a week.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.700
How's it going?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.320
[chuckles softly]

10:24.707 --> 10:26.368
| see what you're doing.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.875
Your trip wasn't postponed.
You canceled it.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.253
| saw you on TV yesterday.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.042
You looked tired, drawn.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.666
| wear it like a badge of honor.
It's called the presidency.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.134
It's called being alone
and having no support system.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.846
The only thing to normalize you
is two kids you see for, what?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.214
-A few hours a day?
-Trey...

10:42.350 --> 10:44.261
-How much do you sleep?
-I appreciate your concern.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.886
But our deal was that you'd be here
for me, not mother me.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.513
Hey, big brother,
I'm not mothering. I'm worried.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.268
-That pressure you're under...
-It comes with the territory.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.396
Complaining would be like a fish
complaining about water being wet.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.522
-[knock at door]
-[door opens]

10:58.658 --> 11:02.117
-You're needed in Command Ops.
-I'm coming. Sorry, Trey.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.156
I'll have someone send you up that burger.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.622
[Aaron] Mr. President, coming through.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.876
[Tom] Thank you.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.790
-Can you hear me?
-We came under heavy fire, sir.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.299
-Casualties?
-[SEAL team leader] Three of my men dead.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.505
Two missing.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.216
-Was there a breach in intel?
-No, sir.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.923
We picked an isolated spot
for our predawn insertion.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.921
But the region's not entirely unpopulated.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.434
And Agent Wells?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.635
She's one of the two missing.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.436
[Hannah speaking Arabic]

11:38.448 --> 11:40.405
[speaking Arabic]

11:41.951 --> 11:44.033
-[in English] Hannah Wells.
-Salaam.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.277
Rami Bashir.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.498
-Where are your people?
-We got separated.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.840
We're gonna have to wait.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.255
I'll take you to Amal Hamzi,
but you have to go now.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.674
Wait, wait, wait. You work for us.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.800
Trust me. I grew up here in Mahrez.
It's very dangerous. We wait, we die.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.142
[speaking Arabic]

12:11.606 --> 12:13.597
This is your show. Make the call.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.019
[sighs] I've got $100 million
in bearer bonds

12:18.154 --> 12:19.440
earmarked for Amal Hamzi

12:19.572 --> 12:23.907
and a letter from the President of the United
States promising him our logistical support.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.151
If I can just contact him,

12:26.287 --> 12:28.995
get him to rally support against the emir,
we can end this war.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.785
[sighs] It's just the three of us,
Agent Wells.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.537
It's Hannah.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.006
Sergeant Royce Sims. Call me Royce.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.301
[Hannah] Let's go, Royce.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.305
[Aaron] Ambassador Salimi from Kunami's
in town.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.389
-He wants a sit-down.
-[Tom] Fine.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.135
But tell him he better be coming
with a concrete surrender proposal.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.181
Yes, sir.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.305
<i>The Times just posted an editorial
on the administration's failure</i>

12:55.441 --> 12:56.522
to resolve the hack.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.562
Huh. Questioning your leadership
in the middle of a war.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.106
-How patriotic.
-Sells papers, though.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.399
Thank you. Aaron?

13:01.531 --> 13:03.317
The hack investigation's ongoing.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.531
-I'll let you know as soon as I'm briefed.
-[Tom] Good.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.242
[Aaron] The president
wants results, Damian.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.987
We're closing in on the identity
of the hacker who took down NASA

13:10.123 --> 13:12.080
-and DC's power grid.
-Tell me.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.245
The hacks have all employed
the same signature.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.163
-Alan Turing's birthday.
-Yes.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.412
When hackers use a signature,
it's an iterative thing,

13:18.548 --> 13:21.040
which is why Turing's death date
reversed one of the hacks.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.042
So, I played around with anagrams
of Alan Turing,

13:24.178 --> 13:26.590
Alan Mathison Turing, his full name.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.554
Gave me this.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.506
[computer beeps]

13:29.642 --> 13:31.224
"I am a stunning harlot."

13:31.352 --> 13:33.263
[Damian] A web search of that cheeky phrase

13:33.396 --> 13:36.229
brings up a moniker
on a hacking message board.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.731
It sounds like a lead, doesn't it, Chuck?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.272
[sighs] Yeah.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.947
We'll need NSA to pierce the proxy routers
and get a web address.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.567
-I'll get you clearance.
-Good. Aaron, you got a second?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.034
Sure.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.540
[Chuck] I'm a GS-15,

13:57.295 --> 13:59.036
an analyst who specializes
in technical issues.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.082
And?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.205
Working with people
who try to kill our agents

14:02.342 --> 14:04.379
isn't part of the job description.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.919
Damian has done enough
to earn his bona fides.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.421
You have your orders.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.606
You trust this guy?

14:21.694 --> 14:25.983
Well, he's got a $50,000 payday waiting for him
if he leads us to Amal Hamzi.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.822
That doesn't answer my question.

14:27.950 --> 14:32.114
[scoffs] I don't trust anyone, anywhere.
Not until they've earned it.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.862
It's how I stay alive.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.614
[gun firing]

14:38.711 --> 14:39.951
[Hannah panting]

14:45.176 --> 14:46.337
[Royce] One attacker, 12 o'clock.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.130
I'll flank him. You cover...

14:50.640 --> 14:52.301
[screams]

14:53.226 --> 14:55.968
Or you can walk right out in the open
and spray the target.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.469
Get over here!

15:01.734 --> 15:04.567
He's dead. Let's keep moving.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.061
Let's go.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.201
Mr. Ambassador, I thought you understood
the terms of my offer.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.164
Yes, sir.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.078
Then why are you trying to negotiate?

15:20.211 --> 15:23.249
I'm not. I am here to tell you
the emir will surrender.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.292
And accept full responsibility
for the dirty bomb.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.258
Terms should be discussed
after a cessation of hostilities.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.673
Which part of unconditional
do you not understand?

15:31.347 --> 15:33.679
-Ms. Rhodes...
-The president has been very clear.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.390
[Salimi] Yes, clarity is important.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.806
There's no clear evidence
the emir was behind that dirty bomb.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.976
We have bank transfers to Arturo Rojas
from the Kunami government.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.941
Hundreds of people in the royal family
access those accounts.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.606
A written statement from Gregory Bowen
implicating the emir.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.695
-The emir has never met that jackal.
-No, sir!

15:49.824 --> 15:53.158
We've been down this road before
when your country struck the USS Verona,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.072
and you lied about it. To my face!

15:55.204 --> 15:58.367
Allow me to restate my position
for the last time.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.708
The US air force will continue
to bombard your country

16:01.836 --> 16:03.543
until its infrastructure is gone.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.878
The Kunami people will rise up against the emir.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.590
They will hang him in the streets.
That will be his legacy...

16:08.718 --> 16:09.503
Sir--

16:09.635 --> 16:11.501
[Tom] ...unless he chooses
to save his own life

16:11.637 --> 16:16.723
by offering us his unconditional surrender.
That's it. Do we now have clarity?

16:18.561 --> 16:20.268
| will convey your message.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.307
[Tom] Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.017
[Aaron] Mr. President.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.395
Sir, one of our missiles hit a hospital.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.575
Civilian casualties?

16:33.868 --> 16:36.576
Fatalities, sir. A lot of them.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.740
I'll be right there. Give me a moment.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.499
Yes, sir.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.806
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Tom] General, what the hell happened?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.724
[Covell] They painted
over the hospital markings, sir,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.439
they put radar installation on the roof.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.105
[Seth] The PR fallout has begun.
The civilian death toll is at 22.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.479
The emir is calling on the UN
to condemn the strike.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.529
International law says we're on safe ground
if we're attacking military targets.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.323
Anything serving a dual purpose
or camouflaged is fair game.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.819
Not in the court of public opinion.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.200
-It's David versus Goliath.
-David didn't use a dirty bomb.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.702
| want enhanced verification
for any further targets.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.750
Do you want to scale back bombing
as we re-evaluate targets?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.499
No, I want you to be careful.
No more hospitals.

17:36.138 --> 17:40.177
NATO is calling for greater caution
in the US strikes against Kunami,

17:40.810 --> 17:44.644
urging the president to re-evaluate
any attacks on civilian areas.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.104
-[sighs]
-After the incident, where civilians...

17:47.233 --> 17:49.474
-Sir, the UN Secretary-General--
- I know.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.600
He wants a sit-down.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.694
The rest of the world is questioning
our conduct of war.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.313
We need a response.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.110
[Seth] I've drafted a statement,

17:57.243 --> 18:00.201
explaining that great care
is taken to avoid casualties,

18:00.329 --> 18:02.912
but the responsibility for them
belongs solely to the emir.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.159
"Who refuses to protect his citizens,
but instead is sacrificing them."

18:08.254 --> 18:09.836
-Send it out.
-Yes, sir.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.001
Um, Mr. President, uh...

18:12.133 --> 18:15.671
| know it's not my place, sir,
but, uh, the bombing.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.794
Uh, is it not overkill?

18:19.098 --> 18:22.557
The president had to respond decisively
to an act of war, and he did.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.352
-No one thinks war comes without a cost.
-We only have one option here.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.097
That's to win this war.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.687
The faster we do that,
the more lives we save.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.868
The hacker was obsessed with Turing,
used an anagram of Turing's name.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.745
How does that help us track
the hacker's identity?

18:44.874 --> 18:48.037
"I am a stunning harlot" posted
46 messages in the past eight years

18:48.169 --> 18:50.536
-on six tech forums about hacking.
-[typing]

18:50.671 --> 18:53.254
The only proxy server common
to each posting

18:53.382 --> 18:56.841
is exclusive to a mixed-use
commercial facility in Herndon.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.347
-They could've originated anywhere.
-Yes.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.931
But randomizer programs always use the nearest
hub as one of the links in the router chain.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.641
So the more data you have...

19:04.769 --> 19:07.477
The better chance you have
of isolating the hacker's location.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.846
Pull up the business index
to find out which one--

19:09.982 --> 19:12.189
Is technology-orientated. Yeah, I got it.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.399
[typing]

19:18.407 --> 19:21.069
-You were holding out with your intel.
-I wasn't.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.194
Yes, you were,
thinking you could use it to play Hannah.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.614
But she's not here,

19:27.750 --> 19:30.458
SO you're ponying up because
you're worried you've lost your rabbi.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.418
| don't need Hannah. I've got her boss.

19:33.047 --> 19:37.211
Aaron Shore promised me that if I help
find the hacker, I get a full pardon.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.298
-Look, Chuck, I'm not--
-[computer beeps]

19:41.430 --> 19:44.172
Forty-three businesses.
Two are tech-orientated:

19:44.308 --> 19:46.766
a cloud-computing company
run by twentysomethings.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.262
-None of whom would use "harlot.”
-And a computer security company.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.265
Sole proprietorship run by...

19:54.443 --> 19:55.649
a Monica Van.

19:55.778 --> 19:59.567
40, denial of service and electronic vandalism
convictions in 2002.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.814
[Damian] That's our gal.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.156
At Coriolanus,
we provide enterprise solutions

20:05.287 --> 20:07.904
for network security issues.
How can we help?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.658
Our business has been hacked.
We'd like to find the culprit.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.626
Make sure it doesn't happen again.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.799
-[phone beeps]
-Can I get security, please?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.049
I'd think twice about doing that.
Our business is the White House.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.549
He doesn't sound like he works there
and you look like you work in the mail room.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.768
Mr. Rennett is a consultant
for British intelligence.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.808
I'm FBI.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.649
And if you don't answer our questions,
I'll subpoena your servers.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.736
Everything all right, Miss Van?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.651
We're good, Felix. Thanks.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.696
Posting under a pseudonym on message boards
is a hobby of mine. I make no apologies.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.620
And your hack of Barksdale Air Force Base
in 20027

20:52.752 --> 20:54.538
NJ and B in 20067

20:54.670 --> 20:57.037
-Those hobbies, too?
-A former life.

20:57.173 --> 21:01.087
| left all those childish things behind
when I opened this business in 2007.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.379
You posted in 2015.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.129
Conversing with the underground
is how I keep up-to-date on the craft.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.130
Know thy enemy.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.258
You did more than converse.
NASA was compromised.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.725
So was the power grid.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.016
And the coding signature was Alan Turing.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.856
Yeah, I used to be part of
a black hat collective,

21:16.984 --> 21:19.521
and our interest in Turing
is what bonded us.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.190
But the real bad-ass in our group
went by the handle Gamine.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.987
An anagram for enigma.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.076
-Turing cracked the Enigma code.
-Very good.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.538
We're gonna need everything you know
about Gamine.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.251
[Damian] That should help.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.370
[indistinct chatter]

21:41.467 --> 21:42.548
Nice bluff, Charles.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.010
But let me give you a tip the next time
you impersonate an agent.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.718
Use thicker paper, so you can't see
the Dungeons & Dragons logo.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.892
Good advice.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.937
Oh, while I'm at it,
I'll tip off a suspect,

21:57.066 --> 21:59.558
burn down a warehouse and tip the Russians.

22:02.863 --> 22:03.773
[exhales sharply]

22:08.118 --> 22:10.371
[praying softly in Arabic]

22:11.372 --> 22:12.862
Hey, we don't have time for this.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.247
-[Rami muttering]
-[Hannah] We got to keep moving.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.915

and moving fast ahead of schedule.

You know he's lying to us, right?
About everything.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.858

22:45.531 --> 22:48.649
-You said you were from Mahrez?
-Yes.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.525
That's a Sunni stronghold.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.193
[Rami] And?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.453
[Hannah] You're praying with a stone tablet.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.447
That's what Shias do.

22:58.419 --> 23:03.129
Shias are the minority in Kunami,
but the ruling minority, led by the emir.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.217
Who are you?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.172
[grunting]

23:13.309 --> 23:14.265
[Rami gasping]

23:15.811 --> 23:18.974
He was buying time,
leading us into an ambush.

23:20.941 --> 23:21.806
| have his phone.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.391
We gotta go.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.860
[cell phone ringing]

23:29.992 --> 23:31.073
Hannah?

23:31.201 --> 23:32.532
What'd you find out?

23:32.661 --> 23:35.369
Sources say Rami Bashir was
fished out of a creek.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.158
The guy he was impersonating was--

23:37.291 --> 23:41.376
A regime loyalist, which means
we don't know what you've walked into.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.085
I've made plans to extract you.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.625
Great. We're three miles off
from the rendezvous point.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.045
| mean now, Hannah, as in abort the mission.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.669
I can set a GPS lock on your phone,
have you helo'ed out.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.011
-No, Aaron.
-We've been compromised.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.678
We have no idea what you could be
walking into. It's not worth the risk!

23:56.810 --> 23:58.676
We've come this far.
I'm not gonna give up.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.019
-I'll check in when I find Hamzi.
-Hannah!

24:04.985 --> 24:05.895
[Aaron] What do you want?

24:06.028 --> 24:09.396
If it is beneath your president's dignity
to hear the emir's latest proposal,

24:09.531 --> 24:12.660
perhaps you can convey it,
because it is simple.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.026
The emir is now willing to abdicate.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.991
All right. In exchange for what?

24:18.123 --> 24:20.660
Safe passage to a country of his choice,

24:20.793 --> 24:23.751
with verifiable assurances
that he will not rule in exile.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.210
What else?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.584
The emir has $60 billion in offshore accounts
that the US has frozen.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.336
He expects access to those funds restored.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.930
What about acceptance of responsibility
for the dirty bomb?

24:36.058 --> 24:38.095
-That is a nonstarter.
-Then so is your offer.

24:38.227 --> 24:42.095
Mr. Shore, we both know the goal
of your country is the emir's ouster.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.268
This offer accomplishes that.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.391
The rest, I submit, is details.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.813
[Aaron] We disagree.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.440
The emir offers honorable terms
to surrender,

24:53.575 --> 24:56.033
but President Kirkman dismisses them.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.027
-He prefers war.
-[knock at door]

24:58.163 --> 25:00.120
-Yeah.
-[Salimi] He refuses to acknowledge our...

25:01.083 --> 25:03.916
-Emily's in the Oval.
-Thanks, Mike.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.418
Sir...

25:10.092 --> 25:13.050
There's a staffer, Tricia Sims...

25:13.178 --> 25:14.555
Tricia Sims.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.921
She works with Lyor.
| haven't met her yet.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.764
Her brother's in SEAL Team Three.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.767
She's unaware he's in country but...

25:21.895 --> 25:23.226
| thought you should know.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.266
| should talk to her. Thank you.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.898
[Tom] Any word from our missing SEAL team?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.647
They're still incommunicado,

25:33.782 --> 25:36.365
-but Hannah Wells is in transit.
-Okay, good.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.484
-Salimi's going off on us.
- I know.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.612
| was just watching him talk
about civilian casualties.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.834
He forgot to acknowledge that the emir
is using his own people as a human shield.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.371
| need to know the truth.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.878
How are we doing?

25:53.761 --> 25:55.502
Well, we've got a dictator on the run.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.799
But we're taking some hits.

25:59.558 --> 26:04.303
People I respect think we can end the war
by simply deposing the emir.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.305
And if that is a viable option,
we should take it.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.023
That's a view.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.482
Is that your view?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.695
| think the emir in exile,

26:14.823 --> 26:17.235
even with money and freedom,
is worth consideration.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.620
The son of a bitch killed American people
on American soil.

26:19.745 --> 26:23.488
| think the rest of the world needs to know
that if you try that, you'll pay a price.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.580
That's the other view.

26:25.709 --> 26:26.995
But it's not yours.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.629
Emily, I'm not a general.
Hell, I'm not even a politician.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.125
No, you are the president.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.844
I've done absolutely nothing
in my entire life to prepare me for this.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.057
Now I'm the one making decisions,
putting other people's lives in danger.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.675
[sighs]

26:50.901 --> 26:51.857
[scoffs]

26:54.696 --> 26:56.983
Ever think you work for the wrong guy?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.028
No, sir...

27:01.495 --> 27:04.078
because only the right guy
would ask me that question.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.577
People are dying.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.167
Innocent civilians, American soldiers.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.956
Let Aaron know I want to reach out
to the ambassador.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.462
See if we can cut a deal to end this war.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.335
Yes, sir.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.261
[Royce] Someone's coming.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.852
[indistinct chatter]

27:28.981 --> 27:30.312
[Hannah] It's a patrol.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.056
-We can take 'em.
-Wait.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.061
Looks like they're moving on.
No need to eliminate 'em.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.858
We might be safer.
What if they circle back?

27:38.991 --> 27:42.780
Hannah. There's no legitimate
military reason to engage them,

27:42.911 --> 27:44.413
unless you've got a death wish.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.071
What are you talking about?

27:47.207 --> 27:49.619
| just saw you neutralize a threat
by making yourself one.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.253
Now you itching for a fight.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.252
There's a big difference
between bravery and recklessness.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.418
What are you working out here, huh?

27:57.092 --> 27:59.754
| won't let you do it at my expense.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.010
These people killed my friend.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.430
I'm sorry.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.099
But exacting a pound of flesh
ain't gonna bring him back.

28:12.774 --> 28:16.108
-It might give me some peace.
-It won't do that either.

28:20.574 --> 28:24.613
Look, I lost a buddy of mine
a couple years back.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.028
Lost my head for a while.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.788
You know what it got me?

28:31.126 --> 28:34.460
Thirty-two stitches from the wrong end
of an AK-47.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.925
The best way to avenge the dead...

28:43.972 --> 28:46.134
is to stay living.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.967
[engine starting]

28:54.441 --> 28:55.897
[Royce] Come on. Let's go.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.532
-[knock at door]
-[door opens]

29:12.668 --> 29:15.205
Mr. President, Tricia's here to see you.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.044
Right, thank you.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.880
-Tricia.
-Sir. [chuckles softly]

29:20.008 --> 29:22.261
-Is this your first time in the Oval Office?
-Yes, sir.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.342
Please.

29:23.971 --> 29:27.134
| make a habit
of meeting everyone on staff.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.349
I'm sorry that it's taken so long
for us to say hello.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.224
It's no problem at all, Mr. President.
Thanks for reaching out.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.973
Mike says your brother is Special Forces.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.892
Please thank him
and your family for their service.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.354
Thank you, sir.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.356
He'll be very pleased when I tell him.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.575
Hopefully sooner than later.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.489
Yes, sir.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.205
| just wanted to take a moment,

29:53.333 --> 29:55.745
so that, uh,
| could put a face to the name.

29:55.877 --> 29:59.006
May I tell you something
about my brother before I go?

29:59.548 --> 30:00.413
Please.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.881
He finished his third tour six months ago.

30:03.010 --> 30:06.469
It was supposed to be his last,
but he re-enlisted.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.090
Want to know why?

30:08.724 --> 30:09.589
Of course.

30:09.725 --> 30:10.886
Because of you.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.271
He said you always saw a mission through.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.354
And that mission now
is making America safer.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.940
If the leader of the country
has that kind of commitment,

30:20.068 --> 30:23.060
well, it makes it easy
for the soldiers to.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.651
And that's the kind of person
he wanted to serve.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.036
Thank you very much
for sharing that with me.

30:32.706 --> 30:33.946
You made my day.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.197
Please.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.123
[Seth on TV] President Kirkman
has always expressed his willingness

30:40.255 --> 30:41.495
to talk with Kunami.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.498
We've been waiting on indications
from the emir that he'll agree to our terms.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.547
So, this news that we've been engaging
with the Kunami ambassador

30:47.679 --> 30:49.135
shouldn't come as a surprise.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.847
[reporter] So, are negotiations
with Kunami ongoing?

30:51.975 --> 30:54.967
-Yes, but I can't give any specifics.
-[reporters clamoring]

30:55.103 --> 30:56.639
[Tom clears throat]

30:56.772 --> 30:58.809
I'd like to say a few words if I may.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.352
Of course, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.397
Thank you. Please.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.236
I'd like to take this moment

31:06.365 --> 31:09.699
to make my position perfectly clear
to the American people.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.944
| have had colleagues
whom I deeply respect

31:13.080 --> 31:15.447
ask me to conciliate to end this war,

31:15.957 --> 31:18.335
in an effort to protect American soldiers

31:18.460 --> 31:21.248
and end the further loss
of innocent civilian life.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.129
Their instincts are noble.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.123
But war...

31:28.220 --> 31:30.006
War is not noble.

31:30.639 --> 31:31.800
It is brutal.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.673
As a country that has just been attacked,

31:34.810 --> 31:38.519
| think we need to answer
with an unwavering commitment to victory.

31:38.647 --> 31:43.141
The emir will be defeated
or he will surrender unconditionally.

31:43.819 --> 31:48.814
But in my heart, I honestly believe
that there is only one way to respond

31:48.949 --> 31:51.566
to people or nations
who seek to destroy us.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.527
And that is without compromise.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.324
Thank you.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.539
[reporters clamoring]

32:01.211 --> 32:02.952
-That was good.
-Yep.

32:04.131 --> 32:07.294
-Except he doubled down.
-Nope. He went all in.

32:12.514 --> 32:15.176
Mr. Hamzi, you're a hard man to find.

32:15.308 --> 32:19.051
When the ruler of your country
wants to kill you, you need to be.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.441
So the president promises logistical support.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.559
And money.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.858
But he needs to meet you face to face.
Look you in the eye.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.151
| understand.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.649
It's been a long journey for you two.

32:33.785 --> 32:38.029
I'll see about food and water,
and then I will talk to President Kirkman.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.960
Pretty hardscrabble existence.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.626
I'll say.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.233
[Royce] What is it?

33:12.574 --> 33:14.110
It's correspondence.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.407
These letters are addressed to Hamzi
from Ambassador Salimi.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.279
That doesn't make any sense.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.282
Salimi works for the emir, Hamzi's enemy.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.250
[Hannah] Not according to these letters.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.211
We need to talk to the White House now.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.626
[Tom] That should do it.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.130
- I understand we have a deal.
-Yes, we do, Mr. Ambassador.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.758
-You're very good at making them.
-Thank you.

33:41.353 --> 33:45.642
You know, the one you made with Amal Hamzi
was particularly special.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.480
| don't understand.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.725
[Tom] Then please, allow me to explain.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.444
Amal Hamzi was never gonna
take over Kunami.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.313
You were. Amal Hamzi works for you.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.406
That is absurd.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.651
You had Gregory Bowen hire the bomber.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.325
You paid him through government funds,
which led back to the emir.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.415
You knew we'd attack your country
and remove him from power.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.454
This is fantasy.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.498
Then you had Mr. Bowen give us
the location of Hamzi,

34:10.130 --> 34:14.045
who you were hoping we'd support
if the emir didn't surrender.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.431
Once you took power,
you'd make a deal for Bowen's freedom.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.427
Tell him, Greg.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.768
| already signed a confession, Mr. Ambassador.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.190
Mr. President...

34:36.616 --> 34:40.324
I'm the ambassador of Kunami.
| demand to be taken back to my embassy.

34:40.453 --> 34:44.286
Your diplomatic credentials were revoked.
You no longer have immunity.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.158
You, sir, are gonna be staying here with us
for quite some time.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.551
The emir is accusing us of war crimes
for the civilian deaths.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.675
-[Tom] And Amal Hamzi?
-[Aaron] He's in our custody, sir.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.552
We can tie him
to Ambassador Salimi's conspiracy.

35:06.688 --> 35:09.020
Sir, we have a big problem
on the domestic front.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.810
We attacked Kunami
based on faulty intelligence.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.024
The best intelligence we had at the time.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.360
Yes, but it was our rationale
for going to war.

35:15.488 --> 35:18.480
If the emir was being set up,
we need a justification, fast.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.948
Respondeat superior.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.487
My Latin's a little rusty.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.826
[Kendra] It's a common law concept.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.571
It means let the master answer
for the sins of his subordinate.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.790
Salimi was the emir's
hand-picked representative.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.750
If he went rogue and attacked--

35:30.879 --> 35:33.962
The emir's responsible for the actions
of his deputy. That's good.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.251
You could actually spin this.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.044
Kunami's nuclear program,
the Verona attack...

35:37.177 --> 35:38.508
The dirty bomb was the last straw.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.423
But we can't argue
the ends justify the means.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.718
We'll have to sell that we knew
Salimi was going rogue all along.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.011
But we didn't.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.927
The truth is I did what I thought was right.

35:50.732 --> 35:53.190
But I didn't take the proper time
to vet the intelligence.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.401
-I need to take responsibility for that.
-You're needed in Command Ops.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.861
-The rest of the SEAL team just resurfaced.
-Thank God.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.231
[Aaron] You'll thank 'em twice
when you'll see what they found.

36:02.619 --> 36:03.780
Bio-weapons?

36:03.912 --> 36:06.119
[SEAL team leader] Nerve gas.
Thousands of barrels,

36:06.247 --> 36:08.033
at a secret government
chemical weapons facility

36:08.166 --> 36:10.498
we found just after we went
through the mountain pass.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.743
The emir was prepared to use it
against his own people.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.495
-How do we know that?
-[Covell] Agent Wells?

36:14.631 --> 36:17.544
We found documentation
of the emir's plans to use gas

36:17.676 --> 36:20.543
on the Sunni religious dissidents
who opposed the regime.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.965
Tens of thousands would've been killed.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.555
That's justification for war, sir.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.549
A war that I want to bring to a close.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.392
What's our endgame?

36:28.520 --> 36:32.639
With Kunami's anti-aircraft defenses destroyed
and his chemical stockpiles depleted,

36:32.774 --> 36:35.436
we can chopper troops into the capital
by nightfall for mop-up.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.558
Good.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.902
[Darby] The emir will abdicate
by the end of the day.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.148
This completely vindicates your decision
to send in Special Forces.

36:42.283 --> 36:46.322
We're all in debt to SEAL Team Three,
and to you, Agent Wells.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.570
| understand you were separated
from your group.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.290
Yes, but Sergeant Sims helped me get here.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.584
Sergeant Sims. [chuckles softly]

36:54.713 --> 36:57.501
Thank you for your incredible bravery
and your service.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.669
I've had the pleasure
of meeting your sister Tricia,

36:59.801 --> 37:01.462
-who works here.
-[Royce] Yes, sir.

37:01.594 --> 37:05.462
I know it's a breach of protocol,
but could someone tell her I'm okay?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.762
We'll do more than that for you, son.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.976
We'll tell her you're on your way home.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.307
Thank you. Thank you all.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.154
[Tricia] Mike.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.236
Hey, Tricia.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.781
So...

37:29.956 --> 37:31.367
this is weird.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.618
I'm a junior staffer,
and I just spoke to the president,

37:35.754 --> 37:37.836
for the second time today.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.707
He told me my brother
is actually in Kunami.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.174
But he's fine.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.085
That's great news.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.465
| wonder if it was a coincidence
he talked to me

37:49.601 --> 37:52.013
when my brother
was part of the SEAL team he deployed.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.227
Could be.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.147
Thanks, Mike.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.817
Just looking out for one of our own.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.820
Back at ya.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.371
The newly named emir
of Kunami told followers

38:17.504 --> 38:20.087
they are witnessing the unfolding
of a new democracy.

38:20.215 --> 38:24.254
Addressing a cheering crowd
of more than 100,000 in his capital...

38:24.385 --> 38:25.716
-[reporter continues indistinctly]
-Congratulations.

38:26.763 --> 38:27.798
For what?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.048
| heard something about winning a war.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.560
| don't know what I'm doing here, Trey.

38:36.064 --> 38:39.557
-Tom...
-No, this thing with Kunami. [sighs]

38:39.692 --> 38:42.309
It seemed so obvious what the right thing
to do was but...

38:42.904 --> 38:45.692
in the end, nothing's simple.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.363
Didn't you tell me once that
by the time something gets to your desk,

38:50.495 --> 38:52.361
it's because it's a coin toss?

38:52.497 --> 38:55.239
That doesn't mean I'm the man
who should be tossing the coin.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.043
Farmer's horse runs away.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.334
"Bad luck," neighbor says.
"Maybe," farmer says.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.800
Horse comes back.
Brings a second horse.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.386
"Wonderful," neighbor says.
"Maybe," the farmer says.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.380
What the hell do horses
have to do with this?

39:11.516 --> 39:13.553
Farmer's son takes the new horse
for a ride.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.471
He's thrown. Breaks his leg.

39:15.603 --> 39:19.096
"Bad luck," neighbor says.
"Maybe," farmer says.

39:19.232 --> 39:24.443
Next day, the military drafts
all the young men except the farmer's son.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.232
"Wonderful," the neighbor says.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.275
"Maybe," the farmer says.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.578
We never know what our choices will bring.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.738
Nope.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.956
All we can do is hope the smartest,
most thoughtful people are making 'em.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.586
And I'm looking at the smartest,
most thoughtful one I know.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.250
Thank you.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.507
[Tom chuckles softly]

39:47.635 --> 39:48.625
You want a pour?

39:50.096 --> 39:51.257
Maybe.

39:51.848 --> 39:52.804
[laughs]

39:57.645 --> 39:58.760
[Aaron] Hey.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.306
[indistinct chatter on TV]

40:02.442 --> 40:03.432
[Lyor sighs]

40:04.903 --> 40:07.691
-The emir's nephew's taking over.
-Hmm.

40:07.822 --> 40:11.986
Yeah. He's not Churchill,
but he's saying all the right things.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.201
[Aaron] Maybe he'll be
a moderating influence.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.162
At least we have a way forward, right?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.657
So, Gregory Bowen was a bad guy.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.457
-You were saying that all along.
-Yeah.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.376
But how are he and I different?

40:30.178 --> 40:31.839
We're both mercenaries.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.804
He just fell in with the wrong money.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.640
Ambition took hold.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.684
It could've been me.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.357
No, no, not a chance.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.933
Oh, yeah? How do you know?

40:46.778 --> 40:49.816
Because beneath the neuroses
and the perfectionism,

40:49.948 --> 40:52.565
the candor that makes us
want to take a bat to your head--

40:52.700 --> 40:54.361
If this is a pep talk, it's no bueno.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.861
I'm saying you have a streak of decency.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.120
Bowen doesn't.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.865
You'll never be him.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.201
[smacks lips]

41:06.506 --> 41:08.292
-Are we supposed to hug now?
-[laughs]

41:08.424 --> 41:09.926
Because I don't do that.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.088
[cell phone ringing]

41:12.220 --> 41:13.381
Yeah.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.100
We'll be right there.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.181
Let's go.

41:18.685 --> 41:19.891
Now what?

41:22.397 --> 41:25.014
[Dr. Louden] Patient Tom Kirkman
is experiencing a profound

41:25.149 --> 41:28.938
yet repressed sense of grief
over the loss of his wife,

41:29.070 --> 41:33.405
with associated decisional incapacity
and behavior...

41:33.533 --> 41:34.694
[Lyor] What the hell is this?

41:34.826 --> 41:37.113
The recorded session notes
from the president's therapist.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.533
-Those are confidential.
-They were on his therapist's computer.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.282
It was hacked.
The recordings are all over the Internet.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.579
We need to get in front of this.

41:44.711 --> 41:47.578
-How many of the notes were leaked?
-All of them.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.297
You guys have been working on this.
Who the hell is our hacker?

41:50.425 --> 41:51.586
We're closing in on a suspect.

41:51.718 --> 41:55.211
But here's the thing, unlike all the other
hacks, this one comes with a built-in clue.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.724
-His therapy was a closely guarded secret.
-Yes.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.307
And most of the people who knew about it
are in this room.
