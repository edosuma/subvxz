00:36.380 --> 00:38.046
<i>Good morning, Madrid.</i>

00:38.130 --> 00:40.171
<i>Welcome to your favorite show.</i>

00:40.255 --> 00:43.005
<i>The first rays of sunlight
are just appearing,</i>

00:43.088 --> 00:45.171
<i>and it's already over 30º.</i>

00:45.255 --> 00:47.421
<i>Watch out, because forecasts say</i>

00:47.505 --> 00:51.921
<i>that today will be the hottest
for 20 years.</i>

00:52.005 --> 00:53.046
<i>Our recommendation?</i>

00:53.130 --> 00:54.880
<i>Drink plenty of water, wear light clothes,</i>

00:54.963 --> 00:58.671
<i>and grab your diary
and write down all the plans</i>

00:58.755 --> 01:01.588
<i>that we are suggesting...</i>

01:43.463 --> 01:45.838
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:47.630 --> 01:48.630
Relax.

01:49.171 --> 01:50.171
Fuck.

01:57.046 --> 01:58.130
Relax.

02:28.546 --> 02:29.421
Hello?

03:17.338 --> 03:18.921
This heat's unbearable.

03:19.963 --> 03:20.963
It sure is.

03:29.505 --> 03:30.380
Listen.

03:31.588 --> 03:32.588
What?

03:32.671 --> 03:33.880
I'm sorry, really.

03:35.338 --> 03:38.296
It's all right, Marcos.
It's the heat, no one can take it.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.255
You didn't sleep last night either?

03:42.630 --> 03:44.213
You were tossing and turning.

03:44.338 --> 03:47.005
You got up and started pacing
around the house.

03:47.796 --> 03:49.130
I didn't want to wake you.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.088
You kept me up.

03:52.171 --> 03:53.546
I was here for a while,

03:53.880 --> 03:57.046
but I fell asleep again without realizing.

04:09.505 --> 04:10.838
You ugly guy.

04:12.796 --> 04:14.588
This ugly guy is dying of thirst.

04:24.796 --> 04:26.671
What the hell
is wrong with you, Marcos?

04:26.755 --> 04:27.880
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

04:27.963 --> 04:29.046
Nothing.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.921
I just don't like seeing the place
like this, so empty.

04:34.421 --> 04:37.463
Eight years in 20 cardboard boxes
and 15 plastic bags.

04:39.255 --> 04:40.546
You counted them?

04:41.338 --> 04:43.421
Sure, I counted them.

04:46.463 --> 04:48.421
What for?

04:50.588 --> 04:51.630
I don't know.

04:52.088 --> 04:54.005
To see how much we take up, I guess.

04:56.005 --> 04:56.963
You know?

04:58.338 --> 05:00.755
I'd like to come back here years from now

05:01.755 --> 05:03.505
to see who are fucking in this bed,

05:04.005 --> 05:06.380
or who are sleeping
in Celeste's and Eze's rooms.

05:07.505 --> 05:08.505
What for?

05:09.463 --> 05:11.130
To see how they've changed it all.

05:15.671 --> 05:18.546
Things change. And they end, Marcos.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.921
What's good shouldn't change.

05:21.005 --> 05:22.130
Maybe they change

05:22.213 --> 05:25.338
because they have to become
something different, or even better.

05:26.171 --> 05:27.755
Are you Marta or Paulo Coelho?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.338
<i>Trivia question?</i>

05:33.880 --> 05:36.671
<i>Remember the first time
we did it in your room?</i>

05:37.421 --> 05:38.671
- The first time?
- Yes.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.505
Of course, I remember.

05:40.588 --> 05:42.921
I came without getting it in you,
and your teeth mashed it.

05:43.005 --> 05:44.505
- That's a lie!
- A lie?

05:44.588 --> 05:46.005
- Yes.
- A lie?

05:46.088 --> 05:48.088
Marta Garnica, don't lie.

05:48.171 --> 05:49.546
Okay, but just a little,

05:49.630 --> 05:52.796
because it didn't fit in my mouth
and I got nervous.

05:54.630 --> 05:55.713
A board game question.

05:55.796 --> 05:59.755
- Imagine you can travel in time, okay?
- Mm-hm.

05:59.838 --> 06:02.046
You visit yourself, but in the past.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.046
Okay.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.755
What would you say
to 19-year-old Marta, for example?

06:07.463 --> 06:08.588
Mm...

06:09.296 --> 06:12.338
- To go on a diet because she's fat.
- Marta, I'm serious.

06:12.421 --> 06:13.963
Marcos, I don't know.

06:14.296 --> 06:17.838
To do what she wants, I guess.
Knowing what will happen to you sucks.

06:18.088 --> 06:20.588
Nobody likes being told
the ending of a movie, right?

06:24.046 --> 06:27.380
I think I would say one thing to her.

06:27.463 --> 06:29.046
- Oh, yeah? What?
- Yeah.

06:29.546 --> 06:31.296
That one day,

06:31.755 --> 06:34.505
in the café of the main library,

06:34.588 --> 06:37.296
she would meet a Medicine student

06:38.005 --> 06:39.755
who wouldn't have a change
to buy hot milk.

06:40.046 --> 06:43.171
He would ask her for change, of course.

06:43.921 --> 06:45.963
She would buy him the milk,

06:46.046 --> 06:48.505
and he would return it that weekend

06:48.588 --> 06:50.713
with an irresistible combination.

06:50.796 --> 06:52.005
Chinese food and karaoke.

06:53.921 --> 06:56.046
That's what I would say
to 19-year-old Marta.

06:57.171 --> 07:01.046
That seeing this hopeless guy onstage

07:01.130 --> 07:04.463
singing an awful version of "The '80s,"

07:05.463 --> 07:06.921
she would fall in love with him.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.796
<i>- ♪ When you got me to call ♪</i>
- Oh, no!

07:11.880 --> 07:13.505
<i>♪ I didn't suspect it ♪</i>

07:13.588 --> 07:15.880
<i>♪ Wah, pa, pa, pa, pa ♪</i>

07:15.963 --> 07:19.588

08:28.296 --> 08:29.130
Hello.

08:33.421 --> 08:36.587
Look, I like this one,
in black and white.

08:37.546 --> 08:40.212
It's pretty easy, you'll see.
There's no mystery to it.

08:40.546 --> 08:42.587
The shitty part is the parents
who get hysterical

08:42.671 --> 08:44.671
when you have to take a photo of the kid.

08:45.338 --> 08:48.630
If you're patient and tactful,
then you'll have no problem.

08:48.713 --> 08:50.421
I've got a silver tongue.

08:51.838 --> 08:52.755
Let's see.

08:53.796 --> 08:56.380
Well, that's it.
Just these left to hand in.

08:56.463 --> 08:58.755
I told Maria you would
take care of everything.

08:59.255 --> 09:01.463
Any doubts or trouble with anyone,

09:01.546 --> 09:03.213
call me on the number I gave you.

09:04.546 --> 09:07.046
And always give them a photo,

09:07.130 --> 09:08.505
whether or not they want the album.

09:08.588 --> 09:09.880
Relax, it's all under control.

09:10.338 --> 09:13.546
It's a summer job.
I won't have time for hassles.

09:14.963 --> 09:17.338
Maria said it would suck replacing you,
that you're good.

09:17.421 --> 09:18.380
So they say.

09:19.130 --> 09:21.671
Why leave? It's a good job,
compared to what's out there.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.921
It is. But my summer
has lasted five years.

09:25.796 --> 09:27.463
The longest on record.

09:29.546 --> 09:31.505
Here.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.505
Take mine. They'll give you one,
but use this meanwhile.

09:35.588 --> 09:37.838
I forgot to tell you,
it's a hospital rule.

09:37.921 --> 09:38.838
Okay.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.546
Are you spending summer in Madrid?

09:42.463 --> 09:43.338
No.

09:44.046 --> 09:47.463
I wanted to go back to Gijón
for a few days, but now...

09:47.546 --> 09:49.255
I'm going. I have things to do.

10:11.296 --> 10:12.171
Shit!

10:19.921 --> 10:21.421
Eze, it's me.

10:23.005 --> 10:25.255
No, I couldn't.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.005
I don't know, somewhere.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.005
All right, in Lucero.

10:32.421 --> 10:34.421
I need you to come get me.

10:34.505 --> 10:37.213
I'm broke, and this place
is in the boonies.

10:38.546 --> 10:41.380
Yeah, I know.

10:41.796 --> 10:44.796
Don't fuck with me, Eze.
I know. I'm sorry.

10:47.088 --> 10:47.963
Okay?

10:48.463 --> 10:52.130
Okay, swing by home
and don't be long, please.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.921
Oh, hey. Thanks.

10:56.796 --> 10:59.046
I love you. Bye.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.630
THREE MISSED CALLS
NUMBER UNKNOWN

11:13.546 --> 11:14.421
Hello.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.338
I have missed calls from this number.

11:16.421 --> 11:17.838
This is Celeste Rivas.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.421
Oh.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.671
Yes, of course.
I'm still interested, sure.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.796
Why are you dressed like that?

12:48.880 --> 12:50.463
I was going to sleep at home.

12:51.046 --> 12:54.088
- Is it still busted?
- Get in the back. I reserved a space.

13:22.463 --> 13:23.463
Marcos.

13:32.338 --> 13:33.296
Marcos.

14:37.505 --> 14:38.838
Shit.

15:39.963 --> 15:42.838
THE ROOM
BY EZEQUIEL SILAS VERSION 3.0

16:04.630 --> 16:06.505
- What's that?
- A private letter.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.796
Give it to me.

16:07.921 --> 16:09.546
- No, it's private.
- Okay, fine.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.255
- Don't you get the concept of "private"?
- I get the concept.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.546
"London"! What are you up to in London?

16:32.046 --> 16:33.171
How long have you known this?

16:33.546 --> 16:34.630
A while.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.921
- When were you going to tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

16:40.005 --> 16:41.588
You're not telling me, I'm reading it.

16:42.213 --> 16:46.005
I didn't tell you anything
because I thought it was impossible.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.421
But you can see, it's not.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.130
Right.

16:49.588 --> 16:50.588
I can see.

16:53.796 --> 16:57.005
You know what? I don't know
whether to be happy for you or to cry.

16:57.088 --> 16:58.380
Tell me what the hell I do now.

17:01.338 --> 17:03.255
You're an actress.
Try to look like you're glad.

17:04.171 --> 17:05.713
When is this? In the letter.

17:06.296 --> 17:07.338
In a week.

17:08.338 --> 17:10.046
- A week?
- Yes.

17:10.796 --> 17:11.880
A week!

17:12.505 --> 17:15.130
You're leaving for London
in seven days and you don't tell me?

17:15.213 --> 17:17.671
I was going to my parents'
for three months, it's just the same.

17:17.755 --> 17:21.380
- Fuck off! It's not the same!
- No, it's fucking better!

17:21.880 --> 17:25.588
Anyway, it won't change anything.
We can still Skype every day.

17:25.838 --> 17:29.005
If you need help
reading a part or anything, ask me.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.255
I don't think I'll need you
to help me read for parts anymore.

17:33.338 --> 17:34.380
What are you saying?

17:36.380 --> 17:37.713
Stop here, my mouth is dry.

17:37.921 --> 17:38.963
It's your hangover.

17:39.338 --> 17:41.380
Yes, Ezequiel. My hangover and everything!

17:41.463 --> 17:42.421
Fucking stop.

17:56.505 --> 17:57.838
Celeste, what's wrong?

17:59.130 --> 18:00.005
Hey!

18:02.088 --> 18:03.171
- Got any cash?
- Yes.

18:03.255 --> 18:04.296
- He's paying!
- What's wrong?

18:04.380 --> 18:06.255
Nothing, Eze! That's the problem.

18:06.338 --> 18:07.671
Nothing happens in my life.

18:14.713 --> 18:16.796
Well, yeah, it does.

18:17.296 --> 18:20.630
They're opening a fast food joint
near the old university.

18:21.088 --> 18:23.421
Some American fried chicken chain.

18:23.921 --> 18:26.963
One of those that can't use "chicken"
in their name, in case they get sued.

18:27.921 --> 18:30.755
I submitted my CV last week, just in case.

18:31.546 --> 18:32.838
Then they called this morning.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.421
Great plan.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.755
What can they offer you there?

18:39.463 --> 18:41.171
Something, Eze.

18:42.005 --> 18:43.421
It's better than nothing.

18:44.421 --> 18:47.755
I won't have to wait for hours
to get a call from a stranger.

18:47.838 --> 18:51.463
I can get a taxi when I'm stranded
in some dismal metro station.

18:51.546 --> 18:55.255
I can claim for, what, ten-minute work?
The most I've done as an actress.

18:55.713 --> 18:58.505
I can have a sickening,
quiet, normal life.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.505
- Normal is no good to me.
- I don't care.

19:02.588 --> 19:05.505
You're a fucking great actress
and a special person.

19:05.588 --> 19:07.963
Maybe that's the problem, Eze,

19:08.213 --> 19:09.546
thinking we're special.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.713
And nobody has the balls
to tell us that maybe we're not.

21:00.130 --> 21:01.421
<i>Marta?</i>

21:55.713 --> 21:56.671
Good morning.

21:59.921 --> 22:00.796
Morning.

22:24.505 --> 22:25.505
Excuse me!

22:26.296 --> 22:27.255
That's mine.

22:28.463 --> 22:29.421
What is?

22:29.755 --> 22:31.755
- The T-shirt.
- The T-shirt?

22:31.963 --> 22:35.380
I found it in the patio years ago.
I live in ground floor C.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.796
I asked the neighbors,
but nobody knew anything.

22:39.338 --> 22:42.005
- I felt bad about throwing it away.
- You didn't ask me.

22:42.296 --> 22:44.005
- Which apartment are you in?
- Apartment 9B.

22:44.921 --> 22:45.921
Apartment 9B.

22:46.588 --> 22:48.171
I don't think I made it there.

22:52.130 --> 22:52.963
Hey!

22:55.213 --> 22:56.296
I'll swap it with you.

22:58.088 --> 22:58.921
Mm-hm.

22:59.130 --> 23:01.088
Both are mine, you can't swap anything.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.755
Sure, but you could be tricking me.

23:04.046 --> 23:06.630
The T-shirt could belong to someone
who doesn't live here anymore.

23:07.505 --> 23:09.713
You don't look like
you've got anything from '92.

23:11.088 --> 23:12.338
Are you lying to me?

23:13.505 --> 23:14.796
I'll come over.

23:15.130 --> 23:16.921
I'll come over,
I don't want this to stink.

23:26.463 --> 23:28.046
- I'm Marcos, by the way.
- Hm.

23:31.130 --> 23:32.421
- Oh.
- Yeah.

23:34.463 --> 23:37.046
Hello, Marcos from 9B. I'm Maggie.

23:37.796 --> 23:39.546
- Hi, Maggie from ground floor C.
- Mm.

23:39.921 --> 23:40.755
Hi.

23:41.005 --> 23:41.880
You know what?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.505
That T-shirt's definitely mine.

23:46.213 --> 23:49.380
I swear, it was my brother's.
He's 15 years older than me.

23:50.171 --> 23:51.755
As a kid, I was obsessed with it.

23:52.463 --> 23:53.546
You know what I would do?

23:55.671 --> 23:56.963
I would put it on,

23:57.630 --> 23:59.255
and it would fall straight to my ankles.

23:59.546 --> 24:03.171
I told my parents I wanted
to be a striptease artist.

24:03.713 --> 24:06.921
I would take off the T-shirt,
shake my hips, all of it rehearsed.

24:10.713 --> 24:12.630
By the age 13, I had forgotten about it.

24:14.171 --> 24:16.963
When I came to study here,
my brother gave it to me.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.171
He had kept it all that time for me.

24:22.588 --> 24:25.088
I thought I had lost it on Cáceres,
on vacation,

24:25.171 --> 24:26.796
or my mother had thrown it away.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.755
But no, it was closer than I thought.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.255
Come and help me.

24:35.088 --> 24:35.963
Okay.

24:40.630 --> 24:45.588
THE ROOM
BY EZEQUIEL SILAS VERSION 3.0

25:10.713 --> 25:13.671
Stop following me! You are so annoying!

25:13.755 --> 25:14.588
Go to your room.

25:14.671 --> 25:16.505
- Hey, Celeste.
- Leave me alone.

25:16.588 --> 25:18.213
I want to be alone with the boxes.

25:18.296 --> 25:20.713
- Will you stop being a...
- Leave me alone!

25:20.796 --> 25:23.088
I don't want to talk about this now, Eze.

25:23.546 --> 25:25.088
Leave me alone!

25:25.171 --> 25:27.005
Like it better in English? Go away!

25:27.088 --> 25:28.130
I didn't do anything.

25:28.213 --> 25:30.130
You're not my dad!
Leave me alone!

25:30.213 --> 25:31.963
Ezequiel, seriously, leave me alone.

25:35.505 --> 25:36.755
I'm not good at this.

25:37.296 --> 25:38.796
It's easy if you don't think.

25:39.255 --> 25:41.088
- Watch me do it.
- Okay.

25:50.505 --> 25:53.338
<i>♪ When I needed you so ♪</i>

25:54.213 --> 25:55.130
What are you doing?

25:55.505 --> 25:57.505
Singing a song while I fold my sheet.

25:57.796 --> 25:58.921
That's our song.

25:59.130 --> 26:02.380
"It's ours."

26:03.171 --> 26:05.588
The T-shirt's yours, the joint's yours,

26:06.213 --> 26:07.463
and the song is yours.

26:08.421 --> 26:10.713
You think the world is yours.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.921
<i>♪ If I cried at your door, it did... ♪</i>

26:17.630 --> 26:18.588
How does it go?

26:19.421 --> 26:22.713
<i>♪ If I cried at your door, it did... ♪</i>

26:23.380 --> 26:26.671
<i>♪ If I cried at your door, it did... ♪</i>

26:27.588 --> 26:29.630
<i>♪ If I cried at your door, it did... ♪</i>

26:31.046 --> 26:32.005
I don't remember.

26:34.588 --> 26:36.671
It was Pablo, my husband.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.796
He called the cops

26:38.880 --> 26:41.130
when you two came up here,
singing your hearts out.

26:42.171 --> 26:43.796
It got on his nerves.

26:44.713 --> 26:47.546
I told him to leave you alone.

26:47.630 --> 26:49.546
You were just kids having fun,

26:49.630 --> 26:51.463
but he didn't get why you did it.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.546
Our first night here,
it was hot as fuck, like today.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.588
We grabbed some bottles
and came up to the rooftop.

27:01.088 --> 27:02.296
Vodka and orange,

27:02.380 --> 27:04.713
like two brats just getting
into the good life.

27:04.796 --> 27:06.505
We could see all of Madrid.

27:08.338 --> 27:09.755
And it looked so small.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.130
We felt so big.

27:14.380 --> 27:16.255
So we started belting out that song
out of tune,

27:16.463 --> 27:18.630
like a couple of mutts.

27:18.838 --> 27:22.171
<i>- ♪ Where were you when I needed you so ♪
- ♪ When? ♪</i>

27:25.005 --> 27:26.213
It became a custom.

27:26.838 --> 27:30.463
When we were drunk or euphoric,
or both, which was likely,

27:30.963 --> 27:33.005
we would come up here
to sing that damn song.

27:34.338 --> 27:36.588
Until a neighbor called the cops.

27:36.671 --> 27:39.921
And it was always the same, "Sorry,
it won't happen again. See you next time."

27:40.255 --> 27:42.046
But now I know
that the neighbor was Pablo,

27:42.838 --> 27:45.005
the husband of the woman
who steals T-shirts.

27:48.588 --> 27:49.671
Pablo's a good guy.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.588
He has just...

27:52.921 --> 27:55.213
forgotten about the important things.

28:03.213 --> 28:04.130
Got any gum?

28:05.880 --> 28:07.921
No, I don't. Do you think...

28:08.463 --> 28:10.838
that coming up here drunk
and singing that song

28:11.421 --> 28:12.671
was important?

28:18.838 --> 28:19.838
I have to go.

28:19.921 --> 28:21.588
If you'll give me back the T-shirt...

28:31.963 --> 28:32.838
Thanks.

28:36.963 --> 28:38.171
Smells fucking great.

28:40.046 --> 28:43.213
If you lose it again,
I know which door to knock on.

28:45.088 --> 28:46.005
We're leaving.

28:46.421 --> 28:49.171
I mean, I won't lose it again,
at least not here.

28:49.921 --> 28:51.755
Today is our last day in the apartment.

28:52.713 --> 28:55.796
Tomorrow, I'm studying
for my residency in Oviedo,

28:56.213 --> 28:57.838
which is the best city to do it, they say.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.171
You're a doctor?

29:00.755 --> 29:01.838
I'm going to be.

29:02.713 --> 29:04.296
You don't look like a doctor.

29:05.005 --> 29:06.796
Striptease artist, yeah.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.546
No way. I forgot how to do it
when I was about 13.

29:10.838 --> 29:13.296
Maybe you'll get it back,
like the T-shirt.

29:56.671 --> 30:00.171
What? Don't judge me. Not you.

30:09.838 --> 30:11.671
- Hello.
- Hey.

30:14.338 --> 30:16.671
- Shall I help you?
- No, thanks.

30:17.463 --> 30:18.671
I'm a bit bored.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.505
Marcos has gone out,
and I've packed my bags.

30:22.630 --> 30:25.046
- I just have to go get them.
- Great.

30:28.380 --> 30:31.796
Go on, I'll help you,
so we'll finish up sooner.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.880
You know I got a job in Oviedo?

30:36.963 --> 30:37.921
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

30:38.255 --> 30:39.421
They called me yesterday.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.171
I'm going to teach ballet
at a girls' school.

30:43.255 --> 30:44.213
That's nice.

30:45.463 --> 30:48.963
But I'm a bit nervous because
I've never taught anyone before.

30:52.171 --> 30:53.796
Do you think I'll be a good teacher?

30:55.463 --> 30:56.505
I don't know.

30:58.130 --> 30:59.046
Leave it.

30:59.130 --> 31:01.380
I can sort it out better alone,
I know where things go.

31:01.463 --> 31:02.880
You don't even live here.

31:02.963 --> 31:04.921
Well, almost?

31:15.421 --> 31:16.421
What is it?

31:17.755 --> 31:18.588
Nothing.

31:19.671 --> 31:20.755
You're very cute.

31:25.713 --> 31:28.380
Hey, do you mind if we go
to your room for a moment?

31:29.296 --> 31:30.671
I want to show you something.

31:35.463 --> 31:36.380
Come in.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.296
I am going to show you...

31:43.255 --> 31:44.421
a gift for Marcos.

31:44.963 --> 31:46.880
It's to celebrate his residency.

31:47.755 --> 31:49.546
I would like to give it to him tonight.

31:51.046 --> 31:53.296
You're his best friend.
Do you think he'll like it?

31:53.380 --> 31:55.255
I don't know even know what it is.

31:55.921 --> 31:58.421
- It's a map.
- I know it's a map, I get that.

31:59.463 --> 32:02.630
It's a map of the places
we promised we would go to,

32:02.713 --> 32:03.921
but we never went.

32:05.755 --> 32:08.213
Marcos always says
there's something waiting for us

32:08.338 --> 32:09.546
in these places.

32:10.713 --> 32:12.630
And if we don't go find that something,

32:13.338 --> 32:16.338
we'll be stopping halfway,
sort of half-finished.

32:17.088 --> 32:18.796
And it will be lost. "Like tears in rain."

32:18.880 --> 32:20.463
That's from <i>Blade Runner.</i>

32:21.421 --> 32:22.296
Really?

32:23.838 --> 32:26.338
I thought it was a Los Piratas song,
Marcos loves them.

32:26.421 --> 32:28.171
No, the song is a tribute to the movie.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.421
Ah.

32:31.671 --> 32:33.380
We start the trip next week.

32:35.171 --> 32:37.171
Now you know what it is,
do you think he'll like it?

32:39.380 --> 32:40.255
Hello?

32:47.463 --> 32:49.963
Mm. I thought no one is at home.

32:54.463 --> 32:55.338
How's it going?

32:58.296 --> 33:00.505
- Eze's leaving.
- Just for a while.

33:00.755 --> 33:04.588
His parents' place is fucking wild.
Pool, air-conditioning...

33:04.671 --> 33:06.671
They even have a local girl
to do the ironing.

33:06.755 --> 33:10.046
- We could visit him.
- No, he's really leaving. To London.

33:10.505 --> 33:11.421
Really?

33:12.380 --> 33:13.296
When?

33:13.380 --> 33:15.630
He got a scholarship to study film there.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.463
He's leaving in a week.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.630
Good for him. It's long overdue.

33:31.130 --> 33:32.005
Hm.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.671
Hey, that T-shirt?

33:36.046 --> 33:38.005
I thought you lost it.
I loved it.

33:38.088 --> 33:38.963
Right.

33:39.546 --> 33:41.796
Do you know the neighbor
in ground floor C?

33:43.380 --> 33:44.588
- No.
- Yes, she hangs her washing

33:44.671 --> 33:47.213
on the rooftop. Dark hair, attractive,

33:47.296 --> 33:48.755
looks like she was a real beauty.

33:48.838 --> 33:51.338
Ahh. I think I know now.

33:51.755 --> 33:54.755
Never spoke to her.
She's just average, isn't she?

33:55.921 --> 33:58.630
If you run into her
on the stairs, she says hello, but...

33:58.880 --> 34:02.380
Her husband scowls at me a bit,
but she's...

34:02.838 --> 34:04.421
kind of normal. Why?

34:04.505 --> 34:06.171
Just curious. Yeah.

34:10.088 --> 34:12.213
I'll see if I can finish this.

34:12.795 --> 34:14.213
Shut the door, go on.

35:05.546 --> 35:08.088
Get dolled up tonight,

35:08.171 --> 35:11.046
I'm not leaving this place
without singing drunk on the roof.

35:11.505 --> 35:13.880
Pablo's calling the cops again my ass!

35:14.296 --> 35:16.088
Who's Pablo?

35:16.171 --> 35:17.380
Mm...

35:34.963 --> 35:36.088
Go, go, go!

35:36.171 --> 35:38.171
You liked it, eh?

35:39.713 --> 35:40.796
Mm.

35:41.630 --> 35:43.213
- You bitch!
- It's awful!

35:44.463 --> 35:45.296
- Aah!
- Mm.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.755
Abril's over there! Abril!

35:49.338 --> 35:50.213
Cutie!

35:50.338 --> 35:53.505
- Marcos, no, seriously.
- Marta, I'm almost a doctor.

35:53.588 --> 35:55.046
I know the effects.

35:55.130 --> 35:56.755
Let's mess with some chemistry.

35:56.838 --> 35:59.005
- It will be great fun.
- It's up to you.

35:59.088 --> 36:00.255
Eze, come along.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.171
I didn't tell you,
but I'm glad about London.

36:07.296 --> 36:09.546
- It's a fucking great opportunity.
- It's "the" opportunity.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.421
Don't let anyone tell you shit.

36:11.505 --> 36:14.171
Like you don't belong,
your stuff's no good, none of that.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.588
- Who's going to say that?
- You. Who else?

36:17.921 --> 36:20.630
- Remember what I said two years ago?
- No, you talk all the time.

36:20.713 --> 36:22.838
That one day, I'd force you

36:22.921 --> 36:25.755
to make all the ideas you cram
into that notebook come true.

36:26.005 --> 36:26.838
One day.

36:26.921 --> 36:28.338
Then stop fucking around.

36:28.713 --> 36:30.421
That day is staring you in the face.

36:31.463 --> 36:34.213
I'm really going to miss you. I mean it.

36:34.671 --> 36:36.463
- Thanks.
- Marcos.

36:37.588 --> 36:40.505
- How are you?
- Hey, handsome. Come here.

36:41.796 --> 36:44.630
I was looking for the fairy godmother
of this place. Ring a bell?

36:45.921 --> 36:46.796
Do you know Eze?

36:47.671 --> 36:48.505
By sight.

36:48.921 --> 36:50.296
- How are you?
- Good. You?

36:50.505 --> 36:53.046
- Fabulous. When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

36:53.130 --> 36:55.255
I want tonight to be an awesome finale.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.546
I need fairy magic.

36:56.963 --> 36:59.505
Careful, honey, your best days are over.

36:59.588 --> 37:02.755
- You're not up to an all-nighter.
- Eight years deserves a good all-nighter.

37:02.838 --> 37:05.671
Plus, we got a silent carriage.
We'll sleep like babies.

37:07.088 --> 37:09.296
- You're leaving, too?
- Yes, looks like it.

37:09.755 --> 37:12.005
My friend's going to be
a legendary director-screenwriter.

37:12.088 --> 37:14.755
Remember this face,
and give him wings tonight.

37:16.046 --> 37:17.796
Oh, what a cutie, please...

37:18.380 --> 37:20.255
Do you think
I could be a good actress?

37:20.755 --> 37:24.421
With my job,
I've got to give it loads of theater.

37:24.755 --> 37:26.296
And people say I'm terrific.

37:26.546 --> 37:27.421
Hm.

37:27.505 --> 37:29.130
I don't know, I would have to see you.

37:31.963 --> 37:33.213
All right, Marquitos.

37:33.463 --> 37:36.005
What's your wish from the fairy?

37:36.338 --> 37:38.088
- I can choose?
- Of course.

37:43.421 --> 37:45.505
They're kind of bitter,
but they're worth it.

37:45.796 --> 37:46.796
And now...

37:48.838 --> 37:50.255
- Marta.
- Mm-mm.

37:50.546 --> 37:51.380
Not me.

37:51.463 --> 37:53.630
You'll end up drunk
and won't remember anything.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.921
Like the first time we did it?

37:56.005 --> 37:57.005
What happened?

37:57.088 --> 37:59.838
We fucked our brains out,
he took ages to come,

37:59.921 --> 38:02.546
and I did the world's greatest blowjob.

38:02.630 --> 38:03.796
Eze?

38:03.880 --> 38:06.130
A bit less for me, or I'll spin and puke.

38:06.421 --> 38:07.838
- Then just a quarter.
- Go.

38:13.463 --> 38:14.380
And now?

38:15.880 --> 38:18.671
Now shut your eyes, relax,

38:19.005 --> 38:21.671
and ask the fairy godmother
to make your dreams come true.

38:25.505 --> 38:28.171
So far, I just need to piss.

38:28.255 --> 38:29.671
Me, too. Come on.

38:34.921 --> 38:36.630
- I've never seen it.
- What?

38:37.338 --> 38:41.130
We've been living together for eight years
and I've never seen it. Show me.

38:41.213 --> 38:44.255
Stop. Now I can't piss.

38:44.796 --> 38:46.880
I think it's big.

38:46.963 --> 38:47.921
Stop it, really.

38:48.755 --> 38:50.505
Eze, it's only a dick.

38:53.088 --> 38:55.088
You know that Marilyn said that, for her,

38:55.171 --> 38:58.046
making love is just like shaking hands?

38:58.380 --> 38:59.838
She didn't sweat it.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.838
I think it should always be like that.

39:05.505 --> 39:08.130
- I'll wait for you outside.
- No, wait. I'll be quick.

39:18.380 --> 39:20.088
What's wrong?

39:24.380 --> 39:25.505
I brought you this.

39:33.838 --> 39:34.921
I had forgotten.

39:37.213 --> 39:40.171
I know. It's a promise.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.880
We said that the last day
we'll live together,

39:42.963 --> 39:44.880
we would take the same photo as the first.

39:45.713 --> 39:47.296
One for you and one for me.

39:48.755 --> 39:49.713
Yeah.

39:50.671 --> 39:53.796
We also said we would take a trip
on Route 66,

39:53.880 --> 39:55.755
just like those women did,

39:56.505 --> 39:59.505
and stop at a roadside diner
with one of those waitresses

39:59.588 --> 40:03.338
who were constantly pouring black coffee,
and find out if you paid for one,

40:03.421 --> 40:07.380
then they would keep filling it up.
We were never sure.

40:08.588 --> 40:09.796
And we never did it.

40:12.088 --> 40:14.921
Promises suck.
They remind you of what you're not.

40:17.380 --> 40:18.296
Come on.

40:18.838 --> 40:22.255
We owe it to <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>
and the first movie we saw together.

40:39.921 --> 40:41.130
Which one are you keeping?

40:42.421 --> 40:43.880
The photo from the first day.

41:00.921 --> 41:01.963
Don't worry.

41:02.213 --> 41:04.630
It was just a handshake for my friend.

41:07.755 --> 41:09.630
- Listen.
- Mm-hm?

41:13.546 --> 41:15.796
If you don't want to come to Oviedo
and stay here instead,

41:16.171 --> 41:17.588
I would understand.

41:19.380 --> 41:21.255
Why wouldn't I want to go with you?

41:22.005 --> 41:25.130
Look at you, so ugly, so rancid...

41:25.213 --> 41:26.588
I'm serious.

41:27.088 --> 41:29.171
I know you've got your dance stuff here.

41:29.421 --> 41:30.921
You can do things that are worthwhile.

41:32.255 --> 41:35.213
Eze told me they're reopening
those swank theaters on Gran Vía

41:35.296 --> 41:37.171
for musicals.

41:37.255 --> 41:39.380
In Oviedo,
you'll only be a teacher.

41:40.421 --> 41:42.546
- Maybe that's fine for me.
- Don't talk crap.

41:43.046 --> 41:45.796
Talent isn't for teaching,
it's for other stuff.

41:48.296 --> 41:52.296
I would like the talent of knowing
that what you mean

41:53.088 --> 41:55.380
is that things will get simpler.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.088
More genuine.

42:08.463 --> 42:09.296
Okay.

42:10.755 --> 42:12.838
But if you want to stay, I understand.

42:14.338 --> 42:16.505
- You deserve someone good.
- And you're not?

42:18.546 --> 42:19.796
You think I'm a good person?

42:27.880 --> 42:29.338
It will all be fine, really.

42:44.296 --> 42:51.296
<i>♪ I'm not made for you ♪</i>

42:51.630 --> 42:58.630

43:53.130 --> 43:54.671
But you had the tip, right?

43:54.755 --> 43:56.255
What are you talking about?

43:56.338 --> 43:58.130
- Did you like her?
- Not at all.

43:58.213 --> 44:01.588
Abril fell hard for you,
and you for her, a little.

44:01.671 --> 44:04.671
- I missed it, I didn't notice.
- It's okay.

44:05.963 --> 44:07.338
- Go to your fucking house.
- Water!

44:07.421 --> 44:08.963
Son of a bitch!

44:09.046 --> 44:11.088
Hey! Which apartment was it?

44:11.171 --> 44:13.171
- 3A. Come up.
- You bitch!

44:13.755 --> 44:15.796
<i>- ♪ Let it rain, let it rain... ♪</i>
- Come up, smart ass!

44:15.880 --> 44:17.380
No, stop it, shut up.

44:17.838 --> 44:18.671
Run!

44:18.838 --> 44:21.505
- Gosh.
- Oh, man.

44:21.588 --> 44:23.463
Hey, don't go to sleep now, okay?

44:23.546 --> 44:25.088
- Come on.
- I'm falling!

44:25.171 --> 44:26.046
Oh!

44:26.630 --> 44:28.255
- I can't feel my feet.
- Pablo!

44:31.921 --> 44:33.255
- Pablo.
- Fuck.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.671
- Let's go, come on.
- We won't make any noise, Pablo.

44:37.005 --> 44:38.005
Pablo.

44:41.380 --> 44:45.546
...to all the posters
on the walls of this dump

44:45.630 --> 44:47.671
and its wonderful rent control.

44:47.755 --> 44:48.630
Wonderful.

44:48.838 --> 44:50.755
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

44:52.005 --> 44:52.838
Mm!

44:52.921 --> 44:56.880
And also, to our wonderful
no-future professions.

44:56.963 --> 44:58.296
- All right.
- Yes, please.

44:58.380 --> 44:59.713
- They deserve a toast.
- Absolutely!

44:59.796 --> 45:02.630
- No.
- Yes.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.505
Yours, not mine.

45:04.588 --> 45:06.296
What a bummer, Dr. House is speaking.

45:06.380 --> 45:09.838
No, your hippies feeding off
your own dreams. It's fine.

45:10.130 --> 45:11.921
- Fuck off, Marcos.
- Hold on.

45:12.005 --> 45:13.380
A toast to him.

45:13.838 --> 45:15.755
Let's give a toast, Marcos,

45:15.838 --> 45:18.588
to that red bandanna
you put on your doorknob,

45:18.671 --> 45:20.671
so we'll know that you're fucking Marta.

45:20.755 --> 45:21.963
Like you were 15 years old.

45:22.046 --> 45:23.838
- You like it?
- Do you know why I do it?

45:23.921 --> 45:26.088
- Why?
- It reminds me of your hair, Celeste.

45:26.171 --> 45:28.546
Asshole!

45:29.005 --> 45:30.880
- And just in case.
- Just in case of what?

45:30.963 --> 45:33.171
- Just in case we're fucking.
- So what?

45:33.255 --> 45:34.088
Wait.

45:34.171 --> 45:36.588
Let's also give a toast
to that horrible, ugly,

45:36.671 --> 45:39.088
dreadful song

45:39.171 --> 45:41.463
that Eze puts on way up high,

45:41.546 --> 45:44.213
so we won't know what he's up to.

45:44.380 --> 45:46.255
Please, stop.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.546
Wanker!

45:47.630 --> 45:50.713
I never did that.
Really, never in my life, ever.

45:50.796 --> 45:52.630
You should. I do.

45:53.005 --> 45:55.588
- You do it? What?
- Of course. That.

45:55.671 --> 45:56.588
That?

45:56.671 --> 45:58.421
Who would you take to a desert island?

45:58.505 --> 46:00.296
Really? While I'm asleep?

46:01.255 --> 46:02.880
I masturbate while you're asleep.

46:03.171 --> 46:06.838
You masturbate while I'm asleep?
Why don't you wake me up?

46:06.963 --> 46:09.130
- I don't know, if you want...
- You should wake me up,

46:09.213 --> 46:10.338
- Hey!
- so I can help you...

46:11.755 --> 46:13.880
Who would you take to a desert island?

46:13.963 --> 46:15.005
- What?
- What?

46:15.088 --> 46:18.130
It's a game, it's easy.
Perfect for nights like this.

46:18.213 --> 46:20.088
- Not me. I'm sleepy.
- Eze, Eze.

46:20.171 --> 46:21.546
- Eze, Eze, Eze.
- No, seriously.

46:22.088 --> 46:23.046
For a bit.

46:23.130 --> 46:24.671
Come on, Eze, don't be a pain.

46:24.755 --> 46:26.921
Come on, it will take a second.

46:27.005 --> 46:30.880
Imagine there's a nuclear blast
and everything's fucked up,

46:30.963 --> 46:33.130
but there's a desert island

46:33.213 --> 46:35.338
you can go to with two companions.

46:35.421 --> 46:38.338
From the people here,
choose two and say why.

46:38.421 --> 46:39.713
Be honest, or it's no good.

46:39.796 --> 46:41.713
Okay. You start, smart-ass.

46:41.796 --> 46:42.880
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

46:42.963 --> 46:44.671
I wouldn't go to a desert island.

46:44.755 --> 46:46.463
I would rather die in the blast

46:46.546 --> 46:48.588
and go down in film history as a legend.

46:48.671 --> 46:52.713
Hey, legend, maybe it's me.

46:52.796 --> 46:54.046
I don't get it.

46:54.130 --> 46:56.171
If everything's fucked up,

46:56.755 --> 46:59.921
then you and your movies
will also be fucked up.

47:00.005 --> 47:03.088
It really hurts you to see people happy.

47:03.171 --> 47:06.630
One thing you forgot,
you have to accept who you are.

47:06.713 --> 47:08.630
You're a doctor, and I'm a legend.

47:09.213 --> 47:10.838
- Take that!
- Boom!

47:10.921 --> 47:12.046
- In your face!
- She said it!

47:12.171 --> 47:14.255
I accept it.

47:15.046 --> 47:17.088
Come on, I'll start.

47:18.921 --> 47:19.963
I would take...

47:21.421 --> 47:22.755
Uh...

47:22.838 --> 47:24.046
- Celeste.
- Mm.

47:24.755 --> 47:26.421
And Marcos.

47:26.505 --> 47:30.380
Marcos for physical needs, and Celeste,

47:30.463 --> 47:33.671
because I'll need support
when this guy acts like an asshole.

47:34.755 --> 47:37.713
Very nice, beautiful. My turn.

47:37.963 --> 47:40.963
I would take Marta,

47:41.213 --> 47:43.421
- for physical needs and not much more.
- Uh-huh.

47:43.505 --> 47:47.130
And Eze, to give her shit
when she acts like an asshole.

47:47.213 --> 47:48.671
You're the asshole!

47:48.755 --> 47:51.380
- It's a line I heard, it's not mine.
- Sure.

47:51.463 --> 47:52.630
Eze to go.

47:53.755 --> 47:57.421
I think I would take Marcos, and...

47:58.338 --> 48:00.838
- I don't know.
- You do.

48:00.921 --> 48:02.338
All right, then, Celeste.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.921
I think now it would be weird
sharing with strangers,

48:06.755 --> 48:09.213
although Marcos is allergic
to cleaning the bathroom.

48:09.296 --> 48:11.921
- Lying is so ugly! So ugly!
- No, my ass.

48:12.171 --> 48:13.505
It's no lie, man.

48:13.588 --> 48:16.671
You never clean up,
you just move shit around.

48:16.755 --> 48:19.380
Which is the same thing, kind of.

48:21.046 --> 48:21.921
And Celeste?

48:22.005 --> 48:24.005
She puts the feminist porn at full blast

48:24.088 --> 48:26.421
in the early hours
and thinks we don't hear her.

48:26.713 --> 48:30.255
- "We are liberated women!"
- Shut up, stop! No!

48:30.671 --> 48:32.380
- You got to tell the truth.
- What truth?

48:32.463 --> 48:35.421
You chose me to have gorgeous kids,

48:35.505 --> 48:37.546
and repopulate the Earth from that island.

48:37.630 --> 48:39.338
No kids for me.

48:39.421 --> 48:41.463
They ruin fun, they ruin everything.

48:41.546 --> 48:45.046
I would rather be alone
with my movies, chilled out, seriously.

48:45.130 --> 48:47.421
Eze, seriously.

48:47.755 --> 48:51.421
Stop the sad, tormented artist thing,
it doesn't cut it.

48:52.046 --> 48:53.296
Seriously, you're too good.

48:53.380 --> 48:56.088
It depends on your point of view.

48:56.171 --> 48:57.796
- Seriously.
- Yeah?

48:58.671 --> 49:00.296
How about this point of view?

49:00.463 --> 49:01.338
What?

49:03.921 --> 49:07.130
- Shit. I forgot how it went.
- How what went?

49:08.838 --> 49:10.005
How did it go?

49:11.838 --> 49:13.921
Right, I remember!

49:16.171 --> 49:19.713
"With no one around,
who can take off my shells,

49:21.338 --> 49:24.005
this armor I carry
suffocates me with pain."

49:26.130 --> 49:28.755
- What are you laughing at?
- What a shitty point of view!

49:29.838 --> 49:32.630
- That's so corny!
- No, it's not, it's beautiful.

49:32.713 --> 49:35.088
- It's a bit airy-fairy.
- What do you mean?

49:35.171 --> 49:39.213
Marta, you can't put "shell"
and "suffocate" in one sentence.

49:39.296 --> 49:40.463
Marcos, enough!

49:40.838 --> 49:44.130
It's not corny, seriously.
It's not, really.

49:44.213 --> 49:45.088
"Shell," right?

49:45.171 --> 49:47.046
- It makes no sense.
- Enough.

49:47.130 --> 49:48.296
Where did you read that?

49:51.796 --> 49:53.171
Where did you read it?

49:54.380 --> 49:55.296
Tell me!

49:56.130 --> 49:57.130
What's wrong?

49:59.880 --> 50:01.796
Eze, I'm sorry.

50:03.421 --> 50:04.671
I'm sorry.

50:05.171 --> 50:07.671
I accidentally found the script
while I was looking for a pen.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.130
Bullshit. It was in my room.

50:09.213 --> 50:11.505
Sure, but I did need a pen.

50:12.171 --> 50:14.796
The script was on the table,
and I picked it up by chance.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.546
It has been a while
since you wrote anything.

50:17.630 --> 50:19.171
I was excited that you had.

50:19.255 --> 50:20.588
You should've left it there.

50:20.671 --> 50:24.171
You have no right to read private stuff,
much less to laugh at me!

50:24.255 --> 50:26.630
I wasn't. We were just kidding!

50:26.713 --> 50:28.921
Sure! That's why you called it corny.

50:29.005 --> 50:33.130
- We didn't know it was yours.
- So you told the truth.

50:33.213 --> 50:35.796
Eze, it's not like that.
I think it's a beautiful script.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.588
- Forget it, Marta.
- No, seriously.

50:37.671 --> 50:40.005
I didn't want to tell you
because I knew how you would react.

50:40.546 --> 50:43.338
Fuck, stories are written to be read.

50:44.255 --> 50:45.838
You don't have to be ashamed of anything.

50:46.296 --> 50:47.296
It's good.

50:47.380 --> 50:48.671
Did you read all of it?

50:53.380 --> 50:54.463
Marta, look at me.

50:56.296 --> 50:58.671
- Did you or not?
- All of it, it's okay.

50:59.088 --> 51:02.255
- Are you seriously asking me?
- You fucking suck!

51:02.338 --> 51:04.213
No, you have to be really selfish

51:04.296 --> 51:06.130
- to go into someone else's room,
- Hey, Eze.

51:06.213 --> 51:09.130
Read a script that's private...
That's so fucking shitty!

51:09.213 --> 51:11.046
Stop insulting me!

51:13.255 --> 51:15.796
It's not my fault
you're so alone and bitter!

51:21.171 --> 51:22.171
"So alone"?

51:23.296 --> 51:25.296
- Great.
- I didn't mean it.

51:25.380 --> 51:27.630
- What did you mean?
- Nothing, I didn't mean anything.

51:27.713 --> 51:29.213
Shall we play something else?

51:29.296 --> 51:31.796
Yes, let's play something else
because this is stupid.

51:37.963 --> 51:39.088
Listen, Marta.

51:39.921 --> 51:43.380
Sorry. I think it was the crap Marcos
gave me before.

51:43.463 --> 51:45.296
- I'm not used to it.
- Never mind.

51:48.921 --> 51:51.963
But now we're on it,
let's not change the game.

51:54.963 --> 51:56.463
We can mix it up a little.

51:58.213 --> 52:00.505
Let's say the nuclear blast
has reached the island,

52:01.213 --> 52:04.046
and near the island
is another smaller island.

52:04.421 --> 52:07.630
It's tiny, only enough for two people.

52:09.255 --> 52:10.671
You have to choose one.

52:11.505 --> 52:12.671
Who would you take?

52:14.713 --> 52:17.213
- That change is dangerous.
- No way!

52:17.463 --> 52:19.005
Besides, you started the game.

52:19.255 --> 52:21.755
- Eze, you're drunk.
- Like all of us.

52:22.130 --> 52:23.713
Go on, you begin, smart guy.

52:24.421 --> 52:26.796
- Those aren't the rules.
- Fuck the rules.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.380
You can't do that.
That's what rules are for.

52:29.463 --> 52:33.338
They're for breaking.
I don't give a shit about them.

52:33.713 --> 52:36.255
- Marcos, you begin.
- Eze, you're drunk.

52:36.338 --> 52:39.380
What a pain in the ass! Yeah, I'm wasted.

52:40.463 --> 52:42.505
And drunk people tell the truth, right?

52:42.588 --> 52:44.755
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

52:44.838 --> 52:46.838
- There's nothing wrong with you?
- No, I'm fine.

52:46.921 --> 52:47.796
Right.

52:48.671 --> 52:52.088
Marcos, a while ago,
you said you would take us two.

52:52.171 --> 52:54.505
But now you can only choose one.
Who would it be?

52:56.046 --> 52:59.421
Nobody. Let's go up to the rooftop
for a nightcap.

52:59.505 --> 53:01.796
I'm not leaving this place
without singing on the rooftop.

53:01.880 --> 53:05.630
- Forget the fucking rooftop and answer.
- Answer him, and we'll forget this.

53:05.713 --> 53:08.130
- Move your ass.
- Answer him, please.

53:08.213 --> 53:11.796
- Who cares? It's obvious.
- No, I won't choose anyone. Move it!

53:11.880 --> 53:14.380
Answer him, so we can stop
this shitty fucking game.

53:14.463 --> 53:17.380
Will you shut the fuck up
and let him say what he thinks?

53:18.838 --> 53:19.963
Eze, what are you doing?

53:21.005 --> 53:22.630
What, you going to cry now?

53:24.255 --> 53:26.755
- Go to Marcos' room, as usual.
- You idiot.

53:26.838 --> 53:29.088
- What's up with you?
- What the fuck are you doing?

53:29.171 --> 53:30.963
- I'm fucking sick of this girl!
- Will you shut up?

53:31.046 --> 53:32.255
I can't stand her anymore!

53:32.546 --> 53:35.546
- Yeah, she can go the fuck home!
- What the fuck is up with you?

53:35.630 --> 53:37.130
- She's a brat.
- Marta.

53:37.213 --> 53:39.921
- Are you stupid or what?
- She's always causing trouble.

53:40.005 --> 53:42.296
- Eze, you're out of line.
- Yes, go to Marcos' room.

53:42.380 --> 53:44.713
- Eze, you're out of line!
- Get out of here!

53:44.796 --> 53:47.296
- Will you calm down?
- No, I'm sick of this selfish brat!

53:47.380 --> 53:49.380
- Are you an idiot or what?
- I'm fucking sick of her!

53:49.463 --> 53:50.338
Eze, stop it!

53:50.421 --> 53:52.421
- Will you shut up?
- She can fuck off home!

53:52.505 --> 53:54.671
What's wrong? You can't live without us?

53:57.671 --> 54:02.255
I swear that I tried every fucking day
with you!

54:03.130 --> 54:04.088
Every day!

54:04.963 --> 54:06.713
But you won't let me.

54:10.796 --> 54:11.880
And you?

54:13.296 --> 54:14.963
Nothing to say, right?

54:15.380 --> 54:16.255
Yeah?

54:16.755 --> 54:19.463
Sure, because Marta's always there, right?

54:20.713 --> 54:22.755
- Fuck, Marta...
- "Fuck, Marta" what?

54:25.046 --> 54:27.130
That's all you fucking have to say?

54:32.505 --> 54:33.838
Fuck you both.

54:36.088 --> 54:37.755
- Marta.
- Don't touch me!

54:46.588 --> 54:49.005
What the fuck is going on here?

54:49.088 --> 54:51.046
Nothing's going on, right, Marcos?

54:52.671 --> 54:54.213
No, nothing's going on.

54:56.921 --> 54:58.338
I'm going to put on some music.

54:58.921 --> 55:02.005
Maybe it will lighten the mood.
Feel like that?

55:02.588 --> 55:04.296
- Very much so.
- Yes, I bet you do.

55:13.005 --> 55:15.213
I cannot stand that song.

55:17.046 --> 55:19.546
Take off the fucking song.
It's not the time!

55:20.588 --> 55:22.713
Eze, please. Turn it off.

55:47.546 --> 55:50.005
What am I doing?

55:56.588 --> 55:58.130
Eze, please stop it.

55:58.838 --> 56:01.671
Eze, stop it and take off
that fucking song.

56:02.713 --> 56:06.130
Eze, take off that fucking song, please!

56:06.213 --> 56:07.421
Fucking hell!

56:12.338 --> 56:14.130
I'm telling you to take off
that fucking song!

56:20.880 --> 56:22.505
You're a son of a bitch.

56:23.671 --> 56:24.921
Son of a bitch.

56:26.171 --> 56:28.755
Guys, I don't know
if it's the booze or what, but...

56:28.838 --> 56:31.713
- I don't get it at all.
- It's fine.

56:31.921 --> 56:33.880
- Fine?
- It's all good.

56:33.963 --> 56:36.130
You wish, Eze! You wish!

56:36.213 --> 56:37.546
It's fine?

56:37.630 --> 56:40.005
A moment ago, we were just chilling out,

56:40.088 --> 56:42.171
and now you two got like this
over a stupid game?

56:42.255 --> 56:44.463
Stop drinking now, or you'll fuck it up.

56:44.546 --> 56:45.713
Fuck up what, Marcos?

56:45.796 --> 56:46.671
What?

56:48.046 --> 56:49.213
Let's do this.

56:49.713 --> 56:52.005
Let's tidy up, go to bed,

56:52.088 --> 56:54.213
and stop acting like brats,

56:54.296 --> 56:57.421
- which is all we're doing!
- No, we're going to keep playing.

56:57.505 --> 56:59.671
- No, that's enough games.
- It's the last one.

56:59.755 --> 57:00.838
This is dumb.

57:00.921 --> 57:02.963
Stop telling me what to do!

57:03.046 --> 57:05.588
I'm sick of everyone telling me
the way things are!

57:05.671 --> 57:06.630
Stop it!

57:08.463 --> 57:09.921
You're my friends, right?

57:12.588 --> 57:14.671
Then let's play
the oldest game in history,

57:15.296 --> 57:16.421
the fucking truth.

57:16.630 --> 57:18.088
Eze, we're wasted,

57:18.171 --> 57:21.463
and we'll end up saying things
that we might regret later.

57:21.546 --> 57:23.130
Why? We're friends.

57:29.838 --> 57:31.255
Eze, please, stop it.

57:31.921 --> 57:33.255
- Please.
- No.

57:35.338 --> 57:36.713
I'll frame the question.

57:39.046 --> 57:40.630
We have to tell the truth.

57:41.755 --> 57:42.713
Nothing but the truth.

57:46.046 --> 57:47.713
I'll start, I'll make it easy.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.255
What have you never dared to say?

57:54.630 --> 57:56.463
I told you
I would make it easy for you.

58:07.546 --> 58:11.130
Nights with you have been
the best and worst I've ever had.

58:14.213 --> 58:17.963
It was where I've felt most alive,
like the worst prick in history.

58:25.796 --> 58:27.171
Now you really know me.

58:30.755 --> 58:31.755
Bullshit.

58:33.005 --> 58:34.921
I didn't know you could be such a bastard.

58:49.588 --> 58:50.671
You two...

58:51.630 --> 58:52.671
You two...

58:53.796 --> 58:57.088
Both of you are bastards.

59:01.046 --> 59:03.421
- Celeste, don't go.
- Don't touch me.

59:05.005 --> 59:06.546
Celeste, don't go, please.

59:07.755 --> 59:08.963
You don't want me to go?

59:09.671 --> 59:12.630
Hold on, I get it.
You're going to apologize to me.

59:14.713 --> 59:15.588
No?

59:16.255 --> 59:20.296
Ah, you don't want me to go
because you're scared I'll run into Marta.

59:21.921 --> 59:24.130
- Celeste, I'm sorry, okay?
- You're sorry?

59:24.213 --> 59:27.463
Yes, this has nothing to do with you.
It's between Eze and me.

59:27.546 --> 59:31.046
- It has nothing to do with me?
- No, it's between Eze and me.

59:31.130 --> 59:33.796
You're the only person I told
how I felt about him.

59:34.130 --> 59:35.088
The only one!

59:35.505 --> 59:37.838
But that has nothing to do with me, right?

59:38.421 --> 59:40.713
Fine, if it doesn't.

59:41.088 --> 59:42.838
I'll get my stuff and take off.

59:42.921 --> 59:45.380
So you can enjoy
your fucking desert island.

59:45.463 --> 59:47.505
That's what fucks you off,
that he prefers me.

59:47.588 --> 59:49.046
Guys, that's enough, okay?

59:49.130 --> 59:50.296
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.630
Fucking great.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.796
What the fuck. I'm staying.

01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:13.213
Sure. This is my house,
and I'm staying.

01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:16.838
Plus, it's my turn, and I want to play.

01:00:18.671 --> 01:00:19.755
I don't want to go on.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.713
It's my turn, and we're playing.

01:00:23.296 --> 01:00:26.088
Eze said
we had to be honest, right?

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.130
Honest. Right.

01:00:30.255 --> 01:00:32.796
My question is for you, Marcos.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.921
Aren't you tired of being a fucking liar?

01:00:41.046 --> 01:00:41.921
Yes.

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.380
Yes, I am.

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:47.130
Do you know why?

01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:52.338
It's exhausting to have
to convince myself day after day

01:00:52.421 --> 01:00:54.005
that what I have is what I want.

01:00:55.796 --> 01:00:57.255
And I'm very scared, Celeste.

01:00:58.213 --> 01:00:59.505
I'm shitting myself.

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:04.088
Scared to become a prick
that ruins everything he touches.

01:01:06.046 --> 01:01:07.880
I'm scared of hurting Marta.

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:11.380
I'm scared of disappointing you.
I'm scared of losing Eze.

01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:16.046
I'm so tired of being a fucking liar.

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:26.421
Bravo, that was...

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:28.005
...great.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:31.463
You'll end up being the actor
in the house, not me.

01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:34.255
Maybe I can do better than you,
it wouldn't be hard.

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:35.880
You motherfucker.

01:01:39.088 --> 01:01:40.338
I am a motherfucker.

01:01:40.755 --> 01:01:43.796
But I don't say anything to you
when you suck cocks for a role.

01:01:46.005 --> 01:01:48.838
Do you think about the wives
and kids of the guys you fucked?

01:01:48.963 --> 01:01:50.421
Or do you think Marta doesn't tell me

01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:51.588
- what a bitch you are?
- Hey!

01:01:51.671 --> 01:01:53.880
You shut up!

01:01:54.463 --> 01:01:57.463
Stop defending your little friend.
It won't make you a better person!

01:01:57.546 --> 01:02:00.296
He can't fall in love with you!
Do you get it, Celeste?

01:02:00.755 --> 01:02:03.255
He can't fall in love with you
because he's a fag!

01:02:05.838 --> 01:02:09.171
What's it like to be the lapdog of a guy
who couldn't bear to kiss you?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.921
Weren't we playing truth?
Now it's my turn.

01:02:14.088 --> 01:02:15.921
Do you know how much
you resemble your Marilyn?

01:02:16.755 --> 01:02:18.921
Not much. Not much at all.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.505
That fake hair of yours,

01:02:21.588 --> 01:02:23.963
and you fuck anyone
who promises you success.

01:02:24.046 --> 01:02:26.713
And you, if you get nothing,

01:02:27.796 --> 01:02:29.046
it's because you're no good.

01:02:29.921 --> 01:02:31.713
Because you've got nothing new.

01:02:32.255 --> 01:02:35.421
You don't have talent, you're just eager,
and a scholarship won't change that.

01:02:40.838 --> 01:02:43.255
And I'm in love with you,
you idiot.

01:02:43.463 --> 01:02:44.963
I'm in love with you,

01:02:45.046 --> 01:02:47.505
and I struggle every day not to be,
but I can't.

01:02:47.588 --> 01:02:49.463
With Marta, it's all easy,
but not with you!

01:02:56.796 --> 01:02:57.963
Great, right?

01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:00.338
Are you happy?

01:03:01.838 --> 01:03:04.713
All this fucking shit
because of your game.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:05.963
Great.

01:03:14.171 --> 01:03:17.546
Leave her alone. It's not her fault.

01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:21.171
No, it's sure not my fault.

01:03:21.713 --> 01:03:23.005
It's your fault,

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.796
with that goody-goody look of yours.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.546
Fuck, now I get it.

01:03:30.005 --> 01:03:33.421
That fucking song you put on
in your room at full volume.

01:03:33.838 --> 01:03:36.505
It was so I wouldn't
hear you fucking, right?

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.005
And the bandanna on the door,

01:03:40.505 --> 01:03:42.588
it was a signal for Eze, right?

01:03:42.671 --> 01:03:45.505
So he would know Marta was in
and not fuck around.

01:03:46.046 --> 01:03:47.046
Right?

01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:49.713
Fuck.

01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:52.630
Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me!

01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:56.671
You did all this to protect him, right?

01:03:56.755 --> 01:03:58.005
To defend him.

01:03:58.088 --> 01:04:01.088
It's all going fucking great for him.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.463
And me? I'm the fucking clown here.

01:04:04.546 --> 01:04:06.380
You could laugh at me
whenever you liked, huh?

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.380
Answer me, Eze.

01:04:10.088 --> 01:04:12.171
Look at me and answer me.

01:04:13.213 --> 01:04:15.755
Did you laugh at me
while you were fucking?

01:04:16.838 --> 01:04:18.046
Look me in the eye!

01:04:19.338 --> 01:04:20.588
You're a coward.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.296
All day whining about the world,

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.713
and you don't have the balls
to tell the truth.

01:04:24.796 --> 01:04:26.171
What do you want me to say?

01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:28.546
That I'm bitter?

01:04:29.005 --> 01:04:30.296
That we spend our lives planning

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.130
what we're going to do,
and then do nothing?

01:04:33.171 --> 01:04:35.463
- Maybe we're not talented enough.
- Speak for yourself.

01:04:35.546 --> 01:04:38.088
No, for both of us.
Otherwise, why are you so mad?

01:04:38.463 --> 01:04:41.171
- You just can't face it.
- This has nothing to do with it.

01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:43.213
- Then what does?
- You're a coward!

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.130
That's what we're talking about!

01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:47.671
The only truth you've said here
is that you're bitter!

01:04:47.755 --> 01:04:50.963
But I'll tell you something else,
you're a fag.

01:04:51.046 --> 01:04:52.213
- A pervert...
- Shut up!

01:04:57.796 --> 01:04:59.838
I'm sorry.

01:05:10.671 --> 01:05:11.755
Hello.

01:05:14.463 --> 01:05:16.505
Guys, I'm sorry for being so...

01:05:30.921 --> 01:05:33.088
Celeste, Celeste, Celeste...

01:05:35.463 --> 01:05:36.671
I'm a bitch?

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380
Celeste.

01:06:08.213 --> 01:06:09.255
Marcos.

01:06:13.463 --> 01:06:14.421
Marcos.

01:07:06.713 --> 01:07:08.005
Say something, please.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:19.630
One day,

01:07:20.713 --> 01:07:22.963
I was asked a question I couldn't answer.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:28.088
"What am I most proud of?"

01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:30.171
Could you answer?

01:07:32.213 --> 01:07:33.255
I don't know.

01:07:38.505 --> 01:07:39.588
I think it's...

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:44.255
never, ever hurting anyone.

01:07:45.838 --> 01:07:46.838
I don't know why.

01:07:47.588 --> 01:07:49.171
Marta, I was scared to death.

01:08:05.796 --> 01:08:09.088
Marta. Marta. Listen, Marta.

01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:13.421
Marta. Marta. Please, Marta.

01:08:13.505 --> 01:08:14.880
Please. Please.

01:08:21.671 --> 01:08:22.587
You know what?

01:08:24.337 --> 01:08:27.005
Maybe it's because, once,

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:31.587
when I was little, I fell...

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:34.380
in a ballet class,

01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:39.005
and I hit the bar

01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:40.921
really hard.

01:08:41.796 --> 01:08:43.755
The exercise bar, you know.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:47.421
I started crying like never before.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.255
I got a small gash,

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.630
and I was bleeding.

01:08:55.837 --> 01:08:57.005
I was scared

01:08:57.712 --> 01:08:59.671
because it was the first time
I was really hurt.

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:05.212
I thought of all the stitches
I would have to get on the gash.

01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:08.171
I thought I wouldn't be able to take it.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:12.505
Then my mother came to pick me up.

01:09:14.546 --> 01:09:15.921
She took me to hospital.

01:09:19.005 --> 01:09:20.505
Her eyes looked strange.

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:24.546
I thought it was because of me
and my injury.

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:30.837
I asked her and she said it didn't matter.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.505
But I kept at it,

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.087
saying to her, "Mom,

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:39.755
it hurts. It really hurts."

01:09:43.005 --> 01:09:46.087
She said that it was a blow.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.421
It's going to hurt at first,

01:09:49.546 --> 01:09:51.337
but it will pass and be forgotten.

01:09:54.963 --> 01:09:56.713
But her eyes were still strange.

01:09:58.796 --> 01:10:00.338
Her look was empty.

01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:04.005
And when we...

01:10:05.338 --> 01:10:07.171
got home from the hospital,

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.130
it seemed emptier.

01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:14.588
What was missing...

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.546
were the slippers my father wore
around the house,

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:26.255
the pack of cigarettes,
the dresser at the entrance,

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.880
his clothes, his razor...

01:10:38.546 --> 01:10:39.838
I understood why...

01:10:41.088 --> 01:10:43.130
my mother's eyes looked strange.

01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:48.338
Because nothing hurts
more than that, Marcos.

01:10:52.213 --> 01:10:53.630
Not even a gash on a girl...

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.296
who lost her balance in a ballet class.

01:11:36.046 --> 01:11:39.338
Marta. Marta. Marta.

01:11:51.838 --> 01:11:52.755
Marta!

01:11:55.005 --> 01:11:56.005
Marta!

01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:02.755
What, Marcos? What?

01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:36.921
Eze! Eze!

01:12:38.338 --> 01:12:39.255
Eze!

01:12:40.963 --> 01:12:41.838
Eze!

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.796
That's it, you got me.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.296
That's what you wanted, right?

01:12:50.546 --> 01:12:51.880
Well, smart-ass, I'm yours.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.005
What are you doing there?

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.088
Get down, you'll fall.

01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:01.005
Did you notice it's not hot anymore?

01:13:01.088 --> 01:13:04.046
I don't give a shit
about the heat or anything.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.796
I'm begging you, get down from there.

01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:08.921
Eze!

01:13:17.130 --> 01:13:18.796
- Did you throw a glass at me?
- Fuck you.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.046
You're leaving me?

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:26.005
What am I leaving?

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:28.880
Tell me. What the fuck am I leaving?

01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:31.130
What are we?

01:13:36.421 --> 01:13:38.255
- Relax, I wasn't going to jump.
- Don't touch me!

01:13:38.338 --> 01:13:40.463
You always forget
that the neighbor below has a balcony.

01:13:41.796 --> 01:13:43.380
I just wanted some air.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.005
Really, Eze?

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.255
We went through all of it
to end up like this?

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.838
You kick me and I'm left here
feeling like a bastard.

01:13:53.838 --> 01:13:55.130
What got you hard?

01:13:56.421 --> 01:13:57.421
That I had a girlfriend

01:13:57.505 --> 01:13:59.796
or that you didn't have the balls
to admit you're a fag?

01:14:00.005 --> 01:14:02.255
- You don't get it.
- Eze, do you love me?

01:14:02.588 --> 01:14:04.171
- That's not the issue.
- Yes or no?

01:14:04.255 --> 01:14:07.838
- That doesn't matter now.
- I need to know what matters!

01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:10.546
You don't know
what those nights were like for me.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:13.255
For you, it was turn up, shag, and leave.

01:14:13.338 --> 01:14:16.630
But I felt like shit.
Night after night, day after day.

01:14:17.338 --> 01:14:19.005
You had no idea, right?

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.088
You've got no idea about anything.

01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:27.088
I often imagined you staying
at the door and not opening it.

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:29.255
You would turn

01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:31.046
and tell me everything would be all right.

01:14:34.921 --> 01:14:36.130
You know the worst part of it?

01:14:36.546 --> 01:14:39.171
I think you would end up doing to me
the same thing you did to Marta.

01:14:39.463 --> 01:14:41.463
Because you're incapable of loving anyone.

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.421
At least you're not ashamed of her.

01:14:47.421 --> 01:14:50.921
With me, there's only time
for you and me in a fucking bed.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.963
Nothing else.

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.130
- Nothing else?
- Nothing else.

01:14:58.255 --> 01:14:59.588
You really think...

01:15:01.088 --> 01:15:03.005
I only wanted to fuck you?

01:15:07.338 --> 01:15:09.255
Every night I spent with you...

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.505
was the only real thing
I've had in a long time,

01:15:13.588 --> 01:15:14.796
but I didn't know it.

01:15:16.005 --> 01:15:17.213
I didn't know it.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.296
What Marta read in your room
is about us, right?

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.796
Yes.

01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:26.921
How does the story end?

01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:29.880
Badly. The inevitable ending.

01:15:30.546 --> 01:15:32.130
The lead character ended up getting hurt.

01:15:32.213 --> 01:15:33.671
- I never hurt you.
- Come on.

01:15:33.755 --> 01:15:35.130
Not on purpose.

01:15:36.963 --> 01:15:38.171
But you hurt me, you know?

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.130
Do you think I don't know
where you go at night alone?

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.005
You always forget to delete
your Internet history.

01:15:45.088 --> 01:15:47.088
- Are you serious?
- Completely.

01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:49.838
How many have you fucked
while you wait for it all to get better?

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.921
Maybe Celeste is right,
and you're a goody-goody.

01:15:53.463 --> 01:15:55.796
How many cocks have you sucked? Ten?

01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.713
Thirty? Forty? How many?
How many have you sucked?

01:15:59.796 --> 01:16:01.088
Fifteen? How many?

01:16:01.171 --> 01:16:04.213
I stopped when I realized
that all I was looking for was you.

01:16:04.671 --> 01:16:05.588
You!

01:16:06.005 --> 01:16:08.921
And I would rather have our shitty nights
than have nothing with you.

01:16:11.588 --> 01:16:13.630
- But now...
- Now what?

01:16:16.713 --> 01:16:18.421
I can't be involved with you now.

01:16:19.755 --> 01:16:21.005
Eze, please.

01:16:21.671 --> 01:16:25.713
Eze, it's okay.

01:16:25.796 --> 01:16:28.088
I want you. Stay with me.

01:17:04.046 --> 01:17:05.130
Go away.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.338
I told you to go.

01:17:20.921 --> 01:17:23.921
Yes, go away and leave me alone.

01:17:25.755 --> 01:17:26.755
Leave me alone.

01:17:32.838 --> 01:17:36.255
Everyone left me alone, so fuck everyone.

01:18:05.796 --> 01:18:08.713
5 YEARS LATER

01:18:19.505 --> 01:18:21.005
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, boss.

01:18:25.921 --> 01:18:28.296
Turn off the beep, or it's unbearable.

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:32.255
Take out the basket.
Make sure it's out of the oil

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:34.463
before shaking it,
so it doesn't splash. Okay?

01:18:34.546 --> 01:18:36.921
Shake it well, and it goes here.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.255
So...

01:18:39.713 --> 01:18:42.671
this is the standard box of 12.

01:18:42.755 --> 01:18:45.088
And this is the box of six, which is new.

01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:48.213
Always with the tongs,
never with your hands.

01:18:48.296 --> 01:18:49.630
Don't be dirty, okay?

01:18:49.713 --> 01:18:52.213
Hygiene is always the key.

01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:55.588
If your gloves break,
change them immediately, okay?

01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:16.963
Eze!

01:19:21.088 --> 01:19:22.046
Hi.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.421
- It has been so long.
- Yes.

01:19:32.296 --> 01:19:33.671
I thought you were still in London.

01:19:33.755 --> 01:19:35.630
No, I came back.

01:19:36.296 --> 01:19:38.380
I've been here and there, you know.

01:19:38.921 --> 01:19:40.463
No, I don't know.

01:19:40.546 --> 01:19:42.880
I was at my folks' place after London.

01:19:42.963 --> 01:19:44.463
Then I was up north for work.

01:19:44.963 --> 01:19:46.463
I've been in Madrid for about a year.

01:19:47.588 --> 01:19:49.713
- How are you?
- Good.

01:19:50.338 --> 01:19:53.630
- Good. You?
- Good. Great.

01:19:55.338 --> 01:19:57.296
Well, I have to go,
they're waiting for me.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.213
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me, too.

01:20:06.713 --> 01:20:07.755
Eze!

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.421
Come with me to a place, please.

01:20:14.713 --> 01:20:18.546
The area's nice, the rents are low,

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.421
and the metro's right nearby.

01:20:20.505 --> 01:20:22.463
I read that it's going to be
the next Malasaña.

01:20:22.546 --> 01:20:26.630
Yeah, because of the river.
It's just down the street.

01:20:28.588 --> 01:20:30.421
- Can I tell you something dumb?
- Go ahead.

01:20:30.921 --> 01:20:32.213
It's stupid, okay?

01:20:32.755 --> 01:20:36.546
I've Googled your name a lot of times.

01:20:37.213 --> 01:20:40.463
I always hoped to find a photo of you

01:20:40.546 --> 01:20:42.880
on a shoot in London, or...

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:46.755
if you had gotten an award
or published something,

01:20:47.296 --> 01:20:50.380
or you had started a blog
of the stuff you were writing.

01:20:50.463 --> 01:20:51.630
I told you it was dumb.

01:20:52.088 --> 01:20:53.546
And you never found me, right?

01:20:58.088 --> 01:20:59.046
It's here.

01:21:00.796 --> 01:21:01.880
Come inside.

01:21:14.838 --> 01:21:16.588
What is this?

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:25.838
Eze.

01:21:28.963 --> 01:21:31.463
Celeste, the Madrid Council called

01:21:31.546 --> 01:21:33.963
about an agreement
on alternative theaters.

01:21:34.046 --> 01:21:35.255
Call them when you can.

01:21:36.296 --> 01:21:37.213
Hello.

01:21:37.296 --> 01:21:39.338
- Hello, sorry. Hello.
- How are you?

01:21:39.921 --> 01:21:41.838
This is Eze. He's...

01:21:42.755 --> 01:21:43.755
He's a friend.

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:47.296
That's Francesco, the head technician.

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:49.796
Celia, in charge of programming.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.463
- And Irene, head of press.
- How are you?

01:21:51.713 --> 01:21:52.546
How are you?

01:21:52.671 --> 01:21:55.380
We're having a drink next door
with the cast.

01:21:55.463 --> 01:21:56.588
Are you coming?

01:21:56.671 --> 01:21:59.963
No, we're going inside.
I want to show him the stage.

01:22:00.046 --> 01:22:02.463
Okay. Wait, I'll hit the lights.

01:22:02.546 --> 01:22:03.463
Thanks.

01:22:17.421 --> 01:22:19.713
Chon, leave us alone
for a moment, please.

01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:21.171
Thanks, honey.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.671
Welcome to Garaje Lumiere.

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.130
Mutant Fried Chicken gave me
some savings.

01:22:52.421 --> 01:22:54.296
And one night, I had a dream.

01:22:55.046 --> 01:22:58.255
I dreamed of a tiny theater
and a horse smoking a pipe.

01:22:59.296 --> 01:23:01.505
A place where anyone
who wanted to be something,

01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:02.880
could be it.

01:23:03.671 --> 01:23:05.755
I said, "Why not?"

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:08.421
Are you going to act?

01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:11.338
No. I don't know.

01:23:11.796 --> 01:23:13.505
Maybe yes, maybe no.

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:16.421
We have loads of projects to study, and...

01:23:16.796 --> 01:23:20.171
I don't want to steal their chance,
I want to give it to them.

01:23:21.171 --> 01:23:22.880
Maybe that's my place.

01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.296
Write something.

01:23:26.546 --> 01:23:28.505
I'll put it on first,
you've got a connection.

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:31.255
You don't write anymore?

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:34.921
I went back to the hospital,
to take baby photos.

01:23:35.546 --> 01:23:37.463
Now I make up a story for each photo.

01:23:38.088 --> 01:23:41.546
I treat it as a training ground.
Maybe something will come out of it.

01:23:41.838 --> 01:23:42.838
Great.

01:23:45.255 --> 01:23:46.338
I'm relaxed.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.380
I'm good.

01:23:58.255 --> 01:23:59.255
I saw Marcos.

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.421
It was in London.

01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:10.963
Near where I lived.

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:13.671
I was coming back from film school.

01:24:14.088 --> 01:24:17.713
I was crossing at the lights,
and I suddenly saw him.

01:24:19.005 --> 01:24:19.963
In front of me.

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.463
He was... disoriented.

01:24:23.546 --> 01:24:24.588
He looked right,

01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:26.921
like he didn't know
it's all backward in London.

01:24:28.671 --> 01:24:29.796
He didn't see me.

01:24:31.755 --> 01:24:34.338
The light turned green, and he got a call.

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:38.005
There, he stayed, talking.

01:24:39.921 --> 01:24:41.296
And you know what, Celeste?

01:24:42.421 --> 01:24:44.296
I had almost forgotten
what his voice was like,

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:46.755
how he talked.

01:24:48.338 --> 01:24:50.963
And just then I missed him
so much that I ran off.

01:24:51.588 --> 01:24:53.005
I didn't want him to see me.

01:24:54.546 --> 01:24:57.255
The following days, I asked at the school

01:24:57.338 --> 01:24:59.421
if a Spanish guy had asked for me

01:24:59.713 --> 01:25:02.880
or left a letter, a package, something.

01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:05.171
But it's always the same answer.

01:25:05.588 --> 01:25:06.546
"No."

01:25:08.255 --> 01:25:09.921
Maybe he went to look for you.

01:25:12.505 --> 01:25:13.505
Maybe.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.046
I saw Marta, about a year ago.

01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:20.588
How is she?

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:28.713
I was coming home from work,
all sweaty and disgusting,

01:25:29.005 --> 01:25:31.255
and I passed by a theater on Calle Mayor.

01:25:32.088 --> 01:25:35.838
The play on the poster
was <i>The Steady Running of the Hour,</i>

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.046
and I saw her name, Marta Garnica.

01:25:39.921 --> 01:25:43.505
I immediately bought a ticket
and went in to see her.

01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:46.921
She's an actress now. But there is also
some dancing on the play.

01:25:47.546 --> 01:25:51.005
And she's good, that bitch.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.880
Very good.

01:25:53.588 --> 01:25:57.296
I sat near the stage
and in the curtain call,

01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.463
she looked where I was sitting
and I smiled at her.

01:25:59.546 --> 01:26:02.880
I don't know if she saw me,
but she smiled, too.

01:26:03.963 --> 01:26:07.171
Later, I waited in the alley
where the players come out.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.713
It was a bit cold,
and I was kind of hidden,

01:26:10.796 --> 01:26:12.671
maybe that's why she didn't see me.

01:26:13.421 --> 01:26:16.505
Her mother was waiting with a stroller

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:20.380
and a baby, not more than a year old.

01:26:21.338 --> 01:26:25.755
Marta came out, smiled,
leaned down, and picked it up.

01:26:27.213 --> 01:26:31.796
There was no father, no boyfriend,
nothing.

01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:34.505
Just her and her daughter.

01:26:36.588 --> 01:26:38.796
And she was happy, Eze.

01:26:39.963 --> 01:26:43.546
So happy that I didn't dare
to say hello to her.

01:26:45.005 --> 01:26:46.213
I didn't want her to see me.

01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:55.880
It's nice here.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:58.546
Yes.

01:27:00.505 --> 01:27:01.588
It sure is.

01:27:14.046 --> 01:27:15.671
I did the Route two years ago.

01:27:16.588 --> 01:27:17.505
Alone.

01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:21.255
No, not alone, with our photo.

01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:27.796
I fantasized about meeting you
there somewhere.

01:27:28.296 --> 01:27:30.005
I was going to call you,

01:27:30.088 --> 01:27:32.838
but, then, I thought that maybe
it wasn't a good idea.

01:27:33.713 --> 01:27:35.380
I don't know.

01:27:35.796 --> 01:27:37.671
I had this crazy fantasy

01:27:38.005 --> 01:27:40.380
that we would run into each other
in the desert.

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:42.921
One time, I even thought I saw you.

01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:45.838
- But it wasn't me.
- No, I know it wasn't you.

01:27:46.046 --> 01:27:48.255
It wasn't me because I did it
three months ago.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.171
In the end, we kept our promise.

01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:02.796
You always have to keep them,
even if it's solo.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.755
Well, I have to go, I'll be late for work.

01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:12.255
See you later?

01:28:14.671 --> 01:28:15.671
See you later.

01:28:27.755 --> 01:28:28.671
Celeste!
