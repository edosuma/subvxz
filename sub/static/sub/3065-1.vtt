02:13.400 --> 02:14.447
Hey!

03:15.200 --> 03:18.443
Mrs. Ludlow? You ready?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.762
Yep.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.531
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.849
Can I... Is it gonna hurt?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.889
No, it's fine.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.646
On...

03:50.880 --> 03:53.326
- Is this all your stuff?
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.643
- Uh... You sure?
- Yeah.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.360
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Have a great day.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.970
- I think I...
- I got it.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.246
OK.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.767
- Come on, Katy.
- What?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.968
I can put a seat belt on.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.571
Sorry...

04:30.720 --> 04:32.006
Sorry.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.762
Stupid.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.321
What?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.764
What am I supposed to say?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.727
You can say anything you want.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.644
Come on.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.410
Where's Philip?

05:36.640 --> 05:39.325
He's asleep. He's exhausted.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.481
What should I do?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.290
Just put it somewhere.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.688
I closed your wireless account.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.166
Thanks.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.210
What do you want to do about
all your stuff in the city?

06:07.440 --> 06:10.250
You've got some clothes here
in the closet

06:10.400 --> 06:12.846
and I have some more stuff for you
in the attic, if you want.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.729
I'm sure that'll do fine.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.571
It's just like old times.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.130
Hey, Daddy.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.761
So, what happens now?

06:39.960 --> 06:42.611
I'm guessing you give a speech
of some sort.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.240
What do you want to do, El?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.448
Something else.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.329
I'm open to ideas.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.926
I'm looking for
a part-timer on campus.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.843
Was I such a different person
when I lived here?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.280
It was, like, a thousand years ago.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.488
You could take some classes.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.482
Could we talk about it later?

07:11.640 --> 07:14.450
What about Conor?

07:20.320 --> 07:21.367
Hey...

07:21.520 --> 07:24.364
- Auntie Em!
- Hi.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.045
Missed you.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.884
I missed you.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.929
What'd you guys do today, huh?

07:31.080 --> 07:32.605
Chasing butterflies.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.087
- Mm.
- I catched one.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.366
- Really?
- "Caught."

07:36.560 --> 07:37.561
I caught one.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.404
You did?

07:39.600 --> 07:43.400
Jonah Greenbaum ate
a caterpillar at school.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.210
That sounds pretty gross.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.722
Yeah. Will he have a
butterfly in his tummy?

07:48.880 --> 07:50.041
I don't know, honey.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.050
Um, let's, let's give her some time
to get settled in, OK, babe?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.208
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.170
Do you need anything?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.163
Nope. Thank you.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.961
I'm going into town in a bit
if you want to join, get out?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.964
Yeah. You yell up at me
when you're going?

08:59.200 --> 09:01.089
- You ready?
- Yeah.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.927
I feel like
I'm seven years old.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.045
- Why?
- Being here with you.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.008
You remember that time you and Mom took
Katy and me to see Cats for my birthday?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.921
It was a wash for me.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.084
We came in from New Haven.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.890
Yeah, I remember.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.728
I remember the train ride
better than anything.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.201
We were all so gussied up.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.641
Katy and me wearing those
silly matching dresses,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.041
standing on the seats,
looking out at everything,

09:59.240 --> 10:01.004
pointing at this and that.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.366
Everything seemed so limitless.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.284
It was.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.130
It still is.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.248
How many more times do you think
I'll remember that moment?

10:14.400 --> 10:15.811
What?

10:15.960 --> 10:18.566
It was such a good moment,
but I'll probably only...

10:18.760 --> 10:21.730
...remember it a couple of more
times in my life, if that.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.327
Mm, I suppose so.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.523
Whoa, hey. Hey, El.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.845
<i>Hey-</i>

10:43.000 --> 10:45.367
- Hey, Stu.
- Wow.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.968
- Hey. All right.
- You remember my father?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.168
- Hey. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.004
Good.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.242
You're Conor's chef.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.528
Yeah. Yeah, I'm his chef.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.131
Yeah.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.322
How's the restaurant?

11:04.480 --> 11:06.289
Good. Good.
We're doing good.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.249
Everything's all right.
Yeah.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.323
El, you have to register.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.851
We-we have to head off.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.844
All right, yeah, I got to get this back
to the restaurant, but it's good to...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.809
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.450
Hey, if you ever want
to get, like, coffee or...

11:21.600 --> 11:24.251
or something...
you know, shoot me a text

11:24.400 --> 11:25.640
- or call or something.
- OK.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.643
Good seeing you.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.644
- So, Lillian is expecting you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.164
She and I were colleagues at NYU.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.890
I know. You told me.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.810
You have...

11:50.160 --> 11:52.891
- pencils and notebooks and all that?
- Yes, Dad.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.651
I have class, and, um...

11:56.800 --> 11:58.723
then I have patients...

11:58.880 --> 12:01.326
so I guess I'll...

12:01.480 --> 12:03.687
see you at the house
later tonight.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.365
OK.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.849
- Hey, El?
- Yeah?

12:09.040 --> 12:11.247
Have a good first day.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.004
I Will.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.721
How's the weather down there?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.882
- Balmy.
- Do we have an appointment?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.769
I'm Eleanor Rigby.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.570
That must be tough.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.724
I'm here to talk my way
into your Identity Theory class.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.166
Oh, you're Julian's kid.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.567
I need some caffeine.
You're welcome to walk with me.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.768
OK.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.207
So, was Julian into
the Beatles or something?

12:45.360 --> 12:48.125
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

12:48.280 --> 12:53.730
Um, he met my mom on the street during
one of the Beatles' hoax reunions.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.168
There was a rumor they were gonna play
a show here before Lennon died,

12:57.320 --> 12:59.360
just like the one they did
on the rooftop in London.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.808
My parents stood next to each other
waiting for the band to never show.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.281
Nostalgists.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.970
- That, and my dad's surname is Rigby.
- You must detest the Beatles.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.929
No, not really.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.044
Do you want something?

13:16.200 --> 13:17.565
Uh...

13:21.960 --> 13:24.361
Double espresso,
three Splendas, please.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.125
So, why do you want
to be in my class?

13:32.280 --> 13:34.806
Your course sounds interesting.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.322
And... look, you're
a colleague of my dad's, so...

13:38.480 --> 13:40.926
Yeah, well, you got to
do better than that.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.527
- You want me to make something up?
- Well, most people do.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.644
You're just taking classes
just to take classes, right?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.485
- Something like that.
- Well, let me save you some time.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.808
All the perpetual students,
the hedge-fund wives,

13:53.960 --> 13:55.564
and your generation of too many choices,

13:55.720 --> 13:59.247
they usually go to Tim Gunn's class and
listen to him talk about Project Runway,

13:59.440 --> 14:02.649
or you could take the art history class
on the advent of color photography

14:02.800 --> 14:04.928
just for good cocktail party
conversation.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.805
My "generation of too many choices"?

14:08.960 --> 14:11.122
Democracy has its drawbacks.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.129
Here's a double espresso,
three Splendas.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.361
Thank you.

14:18.360 --> 14:22.410
You're... teaching classes
just to teach classes, right?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.407
Something like that.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.723
I'm having a month.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.405
I'm sorry.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.329
Your father didn't give me much warning
or tell me much about you.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.721
And I'm really not
one for nepotism.

14:51.240 --> 14:55.006
I just got the call asking if
I could squeeze you into a class.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.166
So I don't really know who you are.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.766
It's OK.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.008
Neither do I.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.128
You want to help me?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.123
You making chemise?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.203
Mm-hmm.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.887
With summer vegetables
and... and some basil.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.326
Mmm!

16:37.480 --> 16:39.687
You remember when you
first had them, in Luberon?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.171
- Mm-mm.
- No?

16:42.200 --> 16:46.046
You were four,
and you were so fat.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.047
My mother and I would cook
a big plate of them,

16:50.200 --> 16:51.361
and left it on the kitchen table,

16:51.520 --> 16:55.491
and, uh, you would eat one and one
and one and the other

16:55.640 --> 16:58.450
until the plate was...
completely empty.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.164
You went to nursery school
that fall, and all these women

17:03.320 --> 17:07.086
gave me those weird looks,
and... they were wondering

17:07.240 --> 17:08.969
what I was feeding you with.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.806
- Well, I was a butterball.
- I felt completely stupid.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.531
Like I had no idea
what I was doing,

17:15.720 --> 17:17.404
the way those women
looked at me.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.891
Did you?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.451
Did I what?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.040
Did you know what you were doing?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.601
I think I didn't realize
I wouldn't be able to retrieve

17:25.760 --> 17:28.764
all the opportunities
I threw away then.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.241
You're not the only one who's
done stupid things to herself.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.807
My darling.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.808
Charlie called for you.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.480
Oh. What'd she have to say for herself?

17:47.640 --> 17:49.768
Just wanted to see how you were.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.003
She's trying too hard.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.923
She wants you to come to dinner
with her and Aldy

17:56.080 --> 17:58.686
and a bunch of fabulous people
this weekend.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.001
What'd you tell her?

18:00.160 --> 18:02.083
You probably weren't up for it.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.241
God, some people
don't let you forget 'em.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.242
I should go.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.769
Hey, you want to come with me?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.162
Not particularly.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.203
What are you doing?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.691
Shh.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.282
You like it?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.649
It's kind of nice.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.484
Yeah?

18:33.600 --> 18:36.331
Come on, we should go.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.970
I think it'd be good for us.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.202
Why? What makes you say that?

18:40.360 --> 18:45.730
There are many experts who say it's
a good thing to get outside.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.611
Well... and some others say it's not.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.410
You were outside all day today.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.449
Come on, you know what I mean.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.602
I just think...

18:56.840 --> 18:58.126
OK, there was an article...

18:58.320 --> 19:00.448
Oh, my God, you're reading
stupid shit online again.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.285
<i>Yeah. But there was something
in Psychology Today</i>

19:03.440 --> 19:06.683
that I saw at the library,
and you should take a look at it.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.606
I'm managing the periodicals.
I'll give you a copy.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.491
Listen, come with me to Charlie's.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.644
That's an order.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.967
Would you stop doing that?
It's disgusting.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.920
I thought I'd try and make the place
look more pleasant for our guests.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.883
Maybe you could've tried that
earlier, before they got here.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.405
Hey, what happened to your chair?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.365
Glad you didn't
come last night.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.925
Thank you.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.605
No, I mean, people wouldn't leave.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.888
We had stragglers into the wee hours.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.522
Some idiot got too drunk or high
and mistook the chair for a toilet.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.490
- Ew!
- He actually lifted the cushion up...

19:43.640 --> 19:47.611
hosed it down and poured, like,
a gallon of Nature's Miracle on it.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.603
Probably wasn't enough.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.481
- No. Wasn't.
- I would burn it.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.405
No, I inherited it
from my grandmother.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.803
It's French Regency
or some poncy shit like that.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.041
I'd still burn it.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.201
Maybe we should.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.521
Maybe you should.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.565
What have you
been up to, Katy?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.802
Um, what do you mean?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.644
I mean, what have you been up to?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.247
Well... Philip, uh,
is going into the second grade.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.965
And...

20:18.120 --> 20:20.521
- he's about to be eight.
- Cute.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.762
I'm also studying
to take the LSAT.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.966
And I am a

20:26.160 --> 20:28.003
part-time librarian
out in Westport, so...

20:28.200 --> 20:30.168
I have that going for me.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.084
No more with the acting?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.322
No. I mean...

20:34.480 --> 20:37.962
life just...
kind of put a damper on it.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.248
Whatever happened to dreams?

20:40.400 --> 20:45.440
I think our entire generation
is going to grad school,

20:45.640 --> 20:47.768
delaying real life
as long as possible.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.684
Every single one
of all these friends

20:49.840 --> 20:53.162
is getting an MBA
or a JD or a JD MBA.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.845
I lost one of my interns
last month,

20:55.000 --> 20:56.081
and the magazine's
lost a whole bunch...

20:56.240 --> 20:58.607
Shut the fuck up, Charlie.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.765
I'm sorry.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.640
Um... would you forgive us
if we said that we had to leave?

21:07.520 --> 21:08.806
Did I say something wrong?

21:08.960 --> 21:11.406
No, no, no, no, we just have to get
the train to Connecticut.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.449
I don't want to be embarrassed

21:13.600 --> 21:15.728
by what I'm allowed to say or not say
around you.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.922
- Why would you be?
- I don't know. I mean,

21:18.080 --> 21:19.969
I'm embarrassed
that I'm embarrassed.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.610
Oh, come here.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.127
Love you.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.805
I love you.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.325
OK. Bye.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.560
You know, ultimately,
being oneself means

21:36.640 --> 21:38.722
that the faculty of knowing...

21:40.000 --> 21:43.607
...the faculty of knowing lies
within the subject...

21:44.920 --> 21:45.967
...in his head, and...

21:46.120 --> 21:49.283
the subject has such a status

21:49.440 --> 21:53.206
by dint of being enclosed
within himself,

21:53.360 --> 21:58.127
separate and distinct
from the world and from others.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.650
Now, doesn't common sense
tell us the same thing?

22:03.840 --> 22:08.801
Isn't it true that we say,
"What's got into you?" to express...

22:10.080 --> 22:13.163
...surprise at and disapproval of

22:13.320 --> 22:16.324
unexpected and bizarre behavior?

22:18.520 --> 22:21.205
And again...

22:21.400 --> 22:23.687
Doesn't common sense tell us

22:23.840 --> 22:26.889
that strange behavior
is signaled

22:27.040 --> 22:31.409
by tapping one's forehead
with one's forefinger?

22:34.160 --> 22:37.881
"Why the Mind ls in the Head"
is the title of one of the lectures

22:38.080 --> 22:42.051
delivered at the 1951, um, symposium.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.607
One of the most authoritative
voices in this chorus

22:47.800 --> 22:49.928
is Ken Bergens...

22:50.920 --> 22:52.888
...who asked the question:

22:53.040 --> 22:57.967
Can we compellingly reinscribe
what it is to be a person

22:58.120 --> 23:02.523
in a way that moves us away from
the individualist premise...

23:05.120 --> 23:08.329
...and toward the relational?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.882
- Hey, Rigby!
- What the fuck are you doing?

23:13.040 --> 23:15.611
Come on... come on,
I barely got a chance to respond

23:15.760 --> 23:18.411
- before you went AWOL.
- What did I ask you, Conor?

23:18.560 --> 23:21.166
- I just need a second to talk.
- What the fuck did I ask you?

23:21.320 --> 23:23.322
- Give me a goddamn second to talk.
- I gave you plenty of seconds!

23:23.480 --> 23:25.528
Please, do me a favor,
leave me the fuck alone!

23:25.680 --> 23:28.047
You know what? Fine!

23:33.160 --> 23:36.209
Conor? Conor?

23:36.360 --> 23:38.044
Fuck!

23:39.720 --> 23:42.849
- Conor, shit.
- You know this guy?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.889
He's my husband.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.325
Well, that was exciting.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.562
Yeah, it was awesome.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.604
So, you're, uh...

24:01.760 --> 24:04.286
you're back in school?

24:04.440 --> 24:07.250
I'm taking some classes.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.209
I almost didn't recognize you.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.931
What do you mean?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.242
It's just your hair.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.928
It's really pretty.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.488
Where are you living, El?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.007
None of your business.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.688
Is that what you so desperately
needed to talk to me about?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.008
No.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.003
What is it, then?

24:54.680 --> 24:58.162
I was gonna say
something good,

24:58.320 --> 25:00.971
something that
would have...

25:01.120 --> 25:03.964
solved all our problems
and made everything all better,

25:04.120 --> 25:06.964
but you know what,
I forgot what it was.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.284
That's too bad.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.124
Isn't it?

25:23.040 --> 25:24.644
I'm gonna go.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.564
No.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.371
All I want...

25:29.520 --> 25:33.047
is a chance to just talk it out.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.601
Then after that, after that
you can disappear,

25:35.800 --> 25:37.882
to wherever it is
you disappear to.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.690
You ready, sir?

25:42.440 --> 25:44.727
Yeah... yeah,
I was born ready.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.325
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah...

25:46.520 --> 25:47.681
Watch your step.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.040
I'll see you around.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.690
Bye, Conor.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.400
All right,
watch your head coming up.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.566
- Got him?
- I got him.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.200
Now, take it easy.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.485
Can I keep stalking you?

26:04.640 --> 26:07.484
Put your arm there for me?

26:24.360 --> 26:27.762
Hey. Hey, you OK?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.161
Yeah. Um...

26:30.320 --> 26:31.970
What happened?

26:32.120 --> 26:35.442
No. My husband...

26:37.280 --> 26:39.362
I don't know what
to call him anymore.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.490
Oh, yeah.
I have one of those.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.603
So... want to, want to
walk with me?

26:47.760 --> 26:50.161
Join me for a drink
or something?

26:52.120 --> 26:54.964
No, no, not right now, thank you.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.050
Are you awake?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.242
Auntie Em, are you awake?

27:12.440 --> 27:14.408
No, Philip.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.289
Your eyes are open.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.011
Apparently.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.364
Why do you have
your shoes on in bed?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.044
Morning, sunshine.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.001
Mom's making French toast.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.003
All right, I'll be right down.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.685
OK.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.042
Charlie called for you again.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.569
Great.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.241
You came in late last night.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.408
What's with the feast?

28:43.560 --> 28:46.609
We have a special guest star.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.728
Outside.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.648
But it's been hard.
There's a barrier...

29:00.400 --> 29:02.243
Good morning.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.887
No fucking way.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.849
El...

29:10.000 --> 29:11.729
- Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.803
- Come on. Just one second.
- Don't touch me, Katy...

29:13.960 --> 29:16.167
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't... touch me!

29:16.320 --> 29:18.084
Don't... don't...

29:18.240 --> 29:20.641
- Let go!
- No!

29:20.800 --> 29:23.724
Ow!

29:23.880 --> 29:26.008
I will bite you!
I swear to God I will bite you!

29:26.200 --> 29:28.851
I will bite you back!

29:29.000 --> 29:30.684
Ow! Ow!

29:40.720 --> 29:42.563
Goddamn it.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.685
You sandbagged me.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.721
He chairs the Psychology Department.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.645
Good for him.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.361
Well, I just thought he'd be
a bit more qualified to...

30:10.840 --> 30:12.524
to deal with your
circumstance.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.762
What's my circumstance?

30:30.680 --> 30:33.001
He was my grandson.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.045
I lost him, too.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.120
None of us know how to help you.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.642
Well, neither do I.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.323
I'm so glad they delegated
the speech to you.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.249
He's not a stranger...

31:16.760 --> 31:20.287
...that some hospital referred you to.
He's a colleague of mine.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.207
I don't think one session
a week would hurt.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.721
Why can't you talk to me
once a week, Dad?

31:29.880 --> 31:32.042
- Why outsource it?
- I'm not outsourcing it,

31:32.240 --> 31:35.722
and I don't really think you
want to talk to me about it.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.167
I don't need to talk
to another therapist.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.890
Eleanor...

31:40.080 --> 31:43.527
Please, stop reminding me
that something's wrong.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.967
That's... not my intention.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.283
Then... please let me
stop thinking about it.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.724
Tragedy is a foreign country.

32:01.880 --> 32:06.602
We don't know how to
talk to the natives.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.366
What are you talking about?

32:36.120 --> 32:39.966
You know, there's this
really cool thing called chairs.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.202
Yeah, I, I heard about those.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.931
It's actually not
too shabby down here.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.209
You OK?

32:50.600 --> 32:51.806
Sure.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.689
Liar.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.330
Sure.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.808
When's your next class?

32:58.960 --> 33:00.485
It's yours.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.651
Oh.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.921
Do you like hamburgers?

33:10.080 --> 33:12.526
I used to be a vegan.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.331
Mostly 'cause
my husband was a vegan.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.086
Not that I don't agree
with most of the tenets

33:18.240 --> 33:20.322
of vegan ideology, but...

33:20.480 --> 33:22.642
he was one
of those reformed socialists

33:22.800 --> 33:26.122
who seemed sexy
before the '60s started to fade.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.691
Does he teach?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.127
He won tenure
at University of Oregon,

33:30.320 --> 33:31.685
and I got it here.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.081
He went soft, I stayed hard,
that was that.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.009
You have kids?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.486
A son.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.409
I'm not sure
why people have kids.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.764
You know, first there's
the nine months of agony,

33:47.960 --> 33:49.724
your body hurts,
it's hot, it's cold,

33:49.920 --> 33:52.287
you crave pickles,
and there's no words to describe

33:52.440 --> 33:54.283
whatever the fuck labor is.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.283
And then this
little stranger comes out,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.090
sucking every bit of life
you have left in you,

33:58.240 --> 34:00.288
and as soon as you're ready
to jump out of a window,

34:00.440 --> 34:03.046
all of a sudden, he smiles.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.289
Jesus Christ, this is good.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.005
And whatever you do,
however you do it,

34:12.159 --> 34:14.049
however you imagine
your child's life,

34:14.199 --> 34:16.168
or what kind of parent you'd be,

34:16.360 --> 34:18.203
29 years later,
he's in some shrink's office

34:18.360 --> 34:20.886
accusing you of some stupid
thing that you said or did

34:21.040 --> 34:23.725
that for the life of you, you
can't remember saying or doing.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.085
Tell me at your age you're not taking
classes out of boredom.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.891
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.963
What was before this?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.885
Mm, life in general.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.643
Any kids?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.643
Mm-hmm.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.802
Boy or girl?

34:49.960 --> 34:51.849
Boy.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.728
Good luck.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.643
Thanks.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.122
Who's that man who chased you
out of my classroom the other day?

35:04.400 --> 35:08.371
He went soft, I stayed hard,
that was that.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.371
Hey.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.965
Guess what?

35:36.120 --> 35:37.645
What?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.564
I got asked out on a date.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.601
I look stupid.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.807
You look beautiful.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.286
Oh, don't be nice.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.840
This... oh, fuck, I don't understand
why this asshole walked into my library.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.843
Katy...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.411
Don't "Katy" me.
Oh, my God,

36:00.560 --> 36:02.289
Mom and Dad
aren't even back yet.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.090
Maybe I should just...
pull the plug.

36:04.240 --> 36:07.244
No. He'll be here any second.
Calm down.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.920
I'll watch him.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.926
We're just going to pretend
to be interested in each other

36:16.080 --> 36:18.000
over cheap Cabernet,
and he's gonna, like, ask me

36:18.080 --> 36:20.765
all the same stupid questions
that they ask about Philip,

36:20.920 --> 36:23.605
like who the dad is, and then
look at me like I'm half a moron

36:23.760 --> 36:25.524
for the choices that I've made.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.206
You know, it was easier
when I was an actress,

36:28.360 --> 36:29.885
because I could
just fuck my costars,

36:30.080 --> 36:32.845
but this real-life
pseudo-adult crap sucks my ass.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.530
Katy, shut up.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.325
I feel fat.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.289
You're not fat.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.722
You were always...

36:48.880 --> 36:51.963
who you were gonna be,
I mean, like a woman.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.091
I always... wasn't yet.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.368
Then I was a fraud.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.042
Sometimes I hardly
recognize you with that hair.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.726
Mm.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.843
That's gorgeous.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.321
Goddamn it!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.968
Uh, excuse me?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.610
Hey, come in here.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.605
What was that?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.842
This keeps breaking off.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.641
OK, but we don't say that, lovey.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.086
Why?

37:52.240 --> 37:55.767
'Cause it's not
a nice thing to say.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.560
Are you sure that you're
OK to watch him?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.204
Mom and Dad should
be back pretty soon.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.681
He's here.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.565
- Are y... you sure?
- Yes, I'm positive.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.048
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Change.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.849
So, what do you want to do?

38:18.480 --> 38:20.926
What do you want to do?

38:24.440 --> 38:25.885
Hurry.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.451
I'm coming.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.283
Can I get electrocuted
by lightning bugs?

38:36.440 --> 38:39.171
No. They're harmless.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.847
This is pretty good, isn't it?

39:16.040 --> 39:17.280
Yeah, it is.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.851
<i>Hey-</i>

39:25.000 --> 39:26.604
Hmm?

39:29.000 --> 39:32.641
There's only one heart
in this body.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.689
Have mercy on me?

39:39.400 --> 39:40.481
Shut up.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.762
Want to go to your place?

40:17.920 --> 40:19.888
Yes, please.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.929
I'll tell you what.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.242
- What?
- You make the first move,

40:24.440 --> 40:26.249
and then I'll follow you,

40:26.440 --> 40:27.851
'cause this is...

40:28.000 --> 40:29.809
this is too nice.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.683
Hey, can we drive
somewhere aimlessly?

40:40.840 --> 40:42.490
Yeah.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.250
Right now?

40:45.400 --> 40:47.129
Whenever.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.962
Can we do it this weekend?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.770
Yes.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.011
Where do you want to go?

40:59.160 --> 41:01.322
No destination.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.967
Just rent a car.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.841
We can sing along to whatever
stupid songs are on the radio.

41:12.640 --> 41:16.725
We'll just drive pointlessly
until we feel like stopping.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.447
What would we do then?

41:21.600 --> 41:25.047
Mm, I don't know,
eat something, walk somewhere.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.202
Use your imagination.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.650
Well, I... well...

41:32.840 --> 41:35.684
Your other imagination.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.850
- I have a pretty dirty imagination.
- Stop!

41:45.520 --> 41:47.124
Come on.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.090
Hey, Rigby?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.805
What?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.048
I love you.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.965
It went that badly?

42:54.920 --> 42:57.730
I could've given him
a normal kiss good night

42:57.880 --> 42:59.928
instead of jamming
my tongue down his throat.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.725
So he's cool?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.803
I am so fucked.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.602
You have a little
to drink tonight?

43:24.760 --> 43:26.125
Yeah.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.284
- What's that?
- Shh.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.920
Philip gave it to me so I won't
be afraid of the dark.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.729
You still having trouble with that?

43:41.880 --> 43:43.803
Yeah, guess so. Come on.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.322
Were you OK with him?

43:51.520 --> 43:53.045
Yeah.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.411
Oh, I don't mean...

43:55.560 --> 43:57.324
That's not what I was...

43:59.600 --> 44:00.886
I just...

44:01.040 --> 44:02.405
I'm OK.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.244
Is it OK to be OK?

44:04.400 --> 44:06.323
Yeah, be OK all you want.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.765
Are you really OK?

44:16.960 --> 44:19.440
I can pretend.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.209
All of a sudden, I kind of miss him.

44:45.200 --> 44:47.601
Who?

44:47.760 --> 44:49.444
Conor.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.008
He came by the house the other day.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.889
He talked with Mom,

45:02.040 --> 45:05.567
and... she told me not to tell you.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.643
I'm sorry, Katy.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.531
What for?

45:23.680 --> 45:25.364
I feel like I just dropped in
on you guys

45:25.520 --> 45:28.000
and I sucked all the air
out of the room.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.690
You are kind of a selfish bitch.

45:31.120 --> 45:34.169
Hey. You don't have
to be so honest.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.526
No.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.887
I was really mad at you.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.451
I know.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.443
I'm still really mad at you.

45:41.600 --> 45:42.965
I know.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.730
And you pulled the floorboards
out from under Conor.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.922
He threw Cody's stuff
into the closet.

46:02.600 --> 46:06.047
And then ten minutes later,
he ordered Chinese from Madame Wu's.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.649
I tried for six months.

46:16.760 --> 46:20.048
We were a million miles away
in the same room, and...

46:23.120 --> 46:26.249
...I started to think thoughts
I never thought I'd have.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.729
How have you and Mom
made it this far?

46:47.400 --> 46:48.970
I'm not sure.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.169
Endurance.

47:00.520 --> 47:03.649
Everyone starts out thinking,
"This is forever."

47:06.920 --> 47:08.365
But then things get hard...

47:10.160 --> 47:11.810
...at some point or another.

47:14.560 --> 47:19.248
And then other things don't pan out
the way you thought they would.

47:30.520 --> 47:32.602
I suppose the trick is
not running for the hills,

47:32.760 --> 47:35.969
even when you think it's the
most rational thing to do.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.807
I don't know.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.482
I hate this room.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.081
I've seen worse.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.807
Where?

48:46.960 --> 48:49.201
- Huh?
- Where have you seen worse?

48:49.400 --> 48:50.925
NYU, Yale...

48:51.080 --> 48:52.764
Oh, Yale's butt ugly.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.968
New Haven's butt ugly.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.451
Did you attend any of
those fine institutions?

48:59.600 --> 49:02.968
NYU, and then I grew up at Yale
when my dad was there.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.168
Oh, of course,
you're a faculty brat.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.731
Mm-hmm.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.605
You and my son would
get along like hotcakes.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.326
Not that I'm trying to
set you up or anything.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.403
He lives in Washington,
the state.

49:14.560 --> 49:18.121
He's been pretending to write a novel
there for the last four years.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.845
Learn anything
interesting at NYU?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.207
I abandoned a dissertation.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.129
- Mm! Bold!
- Mm-hmm.

49:28.280 --> 49:29.611
What department?

49:29.760 --> 49:31.444
Anthropology.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.568
Mm. Social? Linguistic?

49:33.720 --> 49:35.927
I was writing an ethnography
on the social world

49:36.080 --> 49:37.889
of performance artists in Paris.

49:38.040 --> 49:42.204
Musicians, dancers, actors, et cetera.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.010
Why?

49:45.560 --> 49:48.086
I don't know;
my mom is a musician

49:48.240 --> 49:50.288
and she's French, so...

49:50.440 --> 49:53.683
No, I mean why did
you abandon it?

49:53.880 --> 49:57.362
Don't tell me something
stupid like love.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.250
You're very talkative.

50:04.400 --> 50:07.290
It's more fun
listening to you.

50:07.480 --> 50:08.720
You'll get over that.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.809
I got pregnant.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.091
Ah, that.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.850
You want to teach this class?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.001
Not really.

50:33.160 --> 50:34.650
Me neither.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.370
I'm gonna do this.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.451
This song is horrible.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.441
It's not good.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.170
It's not.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.607
I th... I think that bad music
turns you on.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.890
Seriously.
Oh, oh, car, car, car, car, car.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.120
Do the thing! Do the thing! Do the...

51:56.480 --> 51:58.687
I don't want them
to see your ta-tas.

52:01.560 --> 52:04.166
We're good, we're good.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.606
Help me.

52:05.760 --> 52:06.886
What?

52:07.040 --> 52:08.121
You know what you're doing.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.806
Stop it.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.601
There you go.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.841
- Should I do it?
- Yeah.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.480
OK, this is kind
of counter-intuitive.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.481
I think I'm instinctually wired
not to be able to do this.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.806
There we go.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.645
Three, two, one.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.962
Just like that.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.246
You look good.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.811
Very impressed.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.571
We have to listen to this?

52:44.960 --> 52:46.166
Hey!

52:46.320 --> 52:48.402
You want it? You want it?

52:48.600 --> 52:49.726
Top 40?

52:49.880 --> 52:50.881
No.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.041
Country?

52:52.200 --> 52:53.770
No.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.369
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.409
My God.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.641
No, that's...

53:05.800 --> 53:07.131
No.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.321
- Can I have some?
- ♪ <i>Thank God...</i>

53:13.040 --> 53:14.041
- Baby?
- Mm-hmm?

53:14.200 --> 53:16.521
As comfortable as this is...

53:16.680 --> 53:18.364
Mm-hmm?

53:18.520 --> 53:20.841
...I'm losing circulation in my legs.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.280
- What are you trying to say?
- That you're fat.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.886
And I love every pound of you.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.166
- Oh!
- Come here.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.970
Mmm.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.930
Did you see where my shirt went?

53:34.080 --> 53:35.320
Try the backseat.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.164
Where... where are you going?

53:42.360 --> 53:44.089
Out here.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.209
You coming?

53:52.400 --> 53:53.561
Yeah.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.525
Where are we?

54:13.880 --> 54:16.087
Someplace good.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.531
- Amazing.
- I know.

54:41.680 --> 54:44.331
You don't have to tell me.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.649
Shit.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.524
Come on, wake up.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.249
Wake up.

56:39.200 --> 56:42.682
What?

56:42.840 --> 56:44.888
You scared the crap out of me.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.366
How did I do that?

56:47.520 --> 56:49.363
I went into your room
to check about you,

56:49.520 --> 56:51.040
and you were gone
and the car was gone.

56:52.280 --> 56:54.487
Yeah, I went for a drive.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.409
Well, don't ever do it again.

56:58.480 --> 57:00.005
Why were you checking on me?

57:00.160 --> 57:02.288
I've always checked on you.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.964
I'm sorry?

57:13.640 --> 57:15.005
You want a sip?

57:15.200 --> 57:17.680
No. Wrong side of the day for me.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.528
You feeling a bit dramatic today?

57:21.680 --> 57:23.205
No, why?

57:25.280 --> 57:27.328
OK.

57:41.640 --> 57:43.642
I played second violin on this.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.882
Boston Symphony. ltzhak Perlman.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.849
I haven't forgotten.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.163
No, I was just reminding myself.

57:53.360 --> 57:55.010
Are you that unhappy?

57:55.200 --> 57:57.806
Mm, I don't believe in unhappy.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.291
I'm just having a quiet crisis,
like you're having yours.

58:01.440 --> 58:04.887
Katy is having hers.
Your father having his.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.208
- Dad's having a crisis?
- Yes.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.203
One in a series.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.328
Why?

58:11.480 --> 58:13.642
No, I don't want to talk
about this now.

58:15.720 --> 58:19.008
Let's keep that
between him and me.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.404
What?

58:47.160 --> 58:49.049
I never wanted to be a mother.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.530
Not much you can do
about that now.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.241
Yeah. It's too late.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.008
I was too young when I had you.

59:01.160 --> 59:02.730
I was the baby.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.166
Why are you telling me this?

59:04.320 --> 59:08.370
I'm telling you this because
I don't want to lie to you.

59:08.920 --> 59:11.685
I don't want you to take
our relationship too personally.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.764
I don't.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.366
- No.
- Give... No.

59:20.520 --> 59:22.807
Give me my wine.
Give me my wine.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.531
Why didn't you tell me Conor
came by the house the other day?

59:29.000 --> 59:31.924
Run for your life, El.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.445
What is that supposed to mean?

59:33.600 --> 59:35.090
Well, this is all too realistic.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.083
Run away for a while.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.924
You sure you're not projecting?

59:39.080 --> 59:41.481
Yes, yes,
I'm sure I'm not projecting.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.603
You liked your semester in Paris,

59:43.760 --> 59:46.286
so why don't you go back there
and finish your dissertation?

59:46.440 --> 59:49.683
You could write in cafes,
read Le Monde.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.769
Eat bread,

59:52.920 --> 59:56.925
make eyes at strangers.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.765
Yeah, I could.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.366
So why are you still here?

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.850
I don't know.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.804
No, but then he takes it out,
and he run, he goes out...

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.121
We're not open quite yet.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.805
Hey, Alexis.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.485
Holy shit.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.326
Is he around?

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.450
Uh, he's in the kitchen
having a talk with Stuart.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.126
OK.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.242
- How you been?
- Good.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.327
- How have you been?
- Good, good.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.046
- How's the painting coming?
- Great.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.249
I'm just finishing up
some stuff that I do at home.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.444
Sorry... everybody.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.206
Holy Shatner.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.489
Good to see you, too, Stuart.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.170
Well, this has been nice,

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.164
reconnecting and, uh...
Seems like old times.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.364
I'm gonna go back to the, uh, kitchen.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.885
Cool, I'll join you.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.649
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.041
Shirley Temple?

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.804
Please.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.521
What do I owe you?

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.001
Your money's no good here.
You know that.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.721
So business is good?

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.046
Yeah.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.120
It's great.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.446
We're closing.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.371
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.443
Yeah, me, too.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.124
So, what's next?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.444
Well, I was thinking
of developing some interests

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.730
that people might actually
take an interest in.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.082
You gonna work for your dad?

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.930
I don't know.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.561
You know, before I met you,
I had no clue who I was.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.569
And then when I was with you...

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.927
...I thought I had it
all figured out, but now...

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.043
Now I'm just back to wondering again.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.450
Well, when you figure it out,
tell me how.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.808
OK.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.766
- Let's get out of here.
- Huh?

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.251
Let's go.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.129
What? Right now?

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.084
Come on. Don't believe
in wasting time.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.964
OK.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.924
Uh...

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.609
Hey, so, where are we going exactly?

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.524
To rent a car.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.366
Fucker!

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.408
We got the car with retarded wipers.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.568
Well, there's no rush.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.443
What are we doing here, El?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.409
You tell me.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.050
You stalked me.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.362
You've said we needed to talk,

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.210
and you showed up at my parents' house.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.887
An hour ago, you waltzed into my bar
and suggested we drive aimlessly

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.486
into the perfect fucking storm here.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.210
So...

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.721
It's kind of funny.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.966
Yeah.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.640
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.401
You know, there was a brief moment
I thought we actually pieced together

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.722
a pretty decent life.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.050
I have to move everything out
of the apartment next week.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.887
Do you want me to keep
anything for you?

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.247
Where are you moving to?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.609
I can move in with
my dad for a while,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.127
until I get things
figured out.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.001
Oh.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.450
You're sopping wet.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.571
You noticed that?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.729
El...

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.045
...wait, wait, wait.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.004
Please, please, wait.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.969
You slept with someone else.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.043
You told me to.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.249
You told me to.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.561
You left.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.488
El, you left.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.330
Hey, now don't...

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.084
El?

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.209
El?

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.885
It doesn't matter.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.362
You suck at lying, El.
You're supposed to say,

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.285
"How the fuck could you
do this to me, Conor?"

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.966
Come on, you're supposed
to say, "That's bullshit."

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.726
You're supposed to say,
"You're a selfish,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.645
- hopeless, disgusting person, Conor."
- No, no, no, no.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.484
- We're past that.
- No, we're not!

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.124
And you just said it for me.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.930
Let's go back to the city.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.689
This is fine.
I'll get out here.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.363
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.689
You're a dick.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.085
And you look like ass.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.481
Thank you.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.880
Where were you last night?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.931
Do you want to take a load off?

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.849
I come here on breaks.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.691
One of the librarians advocates
a whole nap philosophy.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.003
Nap philosophy?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.967
Yeah, naps throughout the day, like,
help with productivity and stuff.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.211
Mm.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.324
If you...

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.323
want to read this.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.201
What?

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.929
I was hoping
you could read my mind.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.529
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.924
You want to do something stupid
this weekend?

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.728
Yeah. I'm the queen of
doing something stupid.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.406
What are you thinking?

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.646
Get bent, take a train into the city,
save the world.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.163
When did you become an idealist?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.322
A couple seconds ago.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.725
I have a date with the
dentist this weekend.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.962
It's OK.
He can be our third wheel.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.811
All right.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.651
I should get back to work.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.724
I'll come wake you up
in a little bit.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.566
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.888
- Would you like drinks?
- Yeah.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.166
Yeah, I'll have a drink.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.322
- Should we get, like...
- A shot?

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.845
Three shots?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.241
Tequila.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.767
A round of tequila.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.081
I feel old!

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.368
- What?
- I feel...

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.964
I feel old!

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.122
Me, too!

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.841
Cheers.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.406
Thanks!

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.523
What's your name?

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.645
I'm good, thanks.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.603
Oh, wait.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.880
Wait...

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.451
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:51.886
- What? What?
- Wait.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.323
What is it?

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.330
Did I hurt you?

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.005
No, no.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.403
What is it?

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.964
You're a stranger.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.846
So are you.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.486
You ever have that moment
where you...

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.450
know you're doing something stupid,
but you do it anyway?

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.724
Yeah, every day.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.006
What?

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.326
Come on.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.720
- No.
- Come on.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.120
Stay there.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.441
I'm gonna go.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.331
No, don't go.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.891
- Don't.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.844
Just stay for a minute.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.561
Really?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.210
Sorry.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.331
Where to?

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.528
Uh...

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.445
Just make a loop around the city.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.409
Got a destination?

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.646
Eventually.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.289
"All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?"

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.680
Hmm?

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.320
That's the Beatles song
you were named after.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.922
Ah. Three Splendas.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.566
Wow, full service.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.441
Want me to come down there or
you want to join me in here?

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.284
I think I'm gonna leave your class.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.802
You're breaking up with me.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.848
So this is what heartbreak feels like.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.885
You never had your heart broken?

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.084
Only read about it in books.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.322
Liar.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.484
Sure.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.327
You know, you don't have to tell me
this. You could've just not shown up.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.569
I just got to get out of here.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.531
"Here"?

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.843
The tri-state area.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.650
Oh.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.930
You know, they say that if you
walk away from things,

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.603
then you'll just keep walking away

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.731
and start a whole
history of walk-aways.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.327
Did that sound as lame
as I thought it did?

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.448
No.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.723
Good, 'cause I don't have a fucking clue
as to how life should be lived.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.009
Well, could you refer me
to someone who does, please?

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.645
Yeah.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.729
I had a dog, Miles.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.882
I got him from a pound.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.883
He did it pretty well.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.401
Lived every day like
he won the lottery.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.722
Where's Miles when we need him?

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.689
Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.081
Took him on a road trip,

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.561
trying <i>to be</i> all <i>Travels with Charley.</i>

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.121
As soon as we hit
the open countryside,

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.090
he starts jumping up and down
like he picked up a scent

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.642
or found something he'd
always been looking for.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.929
Let him out.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.687
He hightails it,
chasing the sun to nowhere.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.445
He ran away?

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.523
Mm-hmm.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.603
I imagine he's happy
wherever he wound up.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.444
Hooked up with some Amish people.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.284
Lives on a dairy farm.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.965
It's possible.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.049
I have a colleague at NYU.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.327
From my days of working
with your dad there.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.610
Teaches anthropology at the
American University in Paris,

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.088
does some work at the
Musee de Quai Branly.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.760
I can make a phone call.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.287
Send him that dissertation
you started on.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.603
Want half a bagel?

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.047
No, I'm good, I'm good.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.571
You getting enough to eat?

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.007
You're starting to sound maternal.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.929
Oh, that would be a first.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.851
When's the last time you got
to talk to your son?

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.851
Some holiday too long ago.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.124
Is it sad that I don't remember?

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:29.645
Probably.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.049
I should call, shouldn't I?

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.804
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.728
Now you sound maternal.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.329
<i>Hello?</i>

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.131
<i>Hello?</i>

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.561
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.163
<i>Hey-</i>

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.811
Do I seem like a
different person to you?

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.448
You look the same to me.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.649
I'm sorry.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.249
For what?

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.846
For disappearing.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.880
We'll never get
to where we were.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.043
Where was that?

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.002
Someplace good.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.686
Yeah.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.929
Tell me what you're thinking.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.088
I forgot what he looked like.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.764
Sometimes l... I'll get
a glimpse of his eyes or...

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.806
...the way he'd smile
at me from his crib.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.044
But then he'll vanish.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.404
I can't picture his face.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.129
I can't picture his face anymore.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.562
He was pale.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.642
He frowned a lot.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.720
He had your eyes,
he had your nose,

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.201
he had your... your lips,

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.089
he had your cheeks.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.322
El, he was all you.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.561
He was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.609
I wasn't prepared for
what this feels like.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.366
I know. Neither was I.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.008
I love you.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.045
I know.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.806
How's it coming?

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.485
It's coming.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.604
There's a great cafe...
called Le Cafe

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.047
at the Rue Tiquetonne

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.846
that a lot of artsy fartsies go to.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.765
Your mother and I used to go there
when we visited her parents.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.606
I met Jean Marie Le Clezio there once,
before he won his Nobel.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.161
Cool.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.201
And you should get
some of those big French macaroons

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:41.288
at Laduree in Saint-Germain.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.603
Call me when you do.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.082
And I will live vicariously
through you.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.724
I will. Thanks.

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.282
I lost you in the ocean once.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.204
What?

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.044
I lost you in the ocean once.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.528
We had rented a house at
Ditch Plains Beach on Montauk,

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.200
when you could afford Montauk.

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.124
You were about two.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.406
Your mother was pregnant
with Katy,

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.166
and I took you down...

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.567
swimming...

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.563
one afternoon.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.046
Not a lot of people down there.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.085
I...

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.131
I waded out, holding you...

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:58.087
...thinking, at one point,
"This might not be the best idea."

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.448
But you were game.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.722
Or I imagined that you were game

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.803
because you never,
ever seemed scared.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.690
Of anything.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.762
The Atlantic is moody,

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.366
and a big set of waves snuck in.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.968
We... made it under the first one.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.762
You were clinging to my neck.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.848
But we got caught
in front of the second.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.642
And I came up without you.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.766
I have never felt
anything like that.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.010
The throes of that stupid
couple seconds...

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.447
treading the white water.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.883
And then, miraculously, I...

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.049
...felt you at my feet.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.048
I never told your mother.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.690
I never told anyone.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.003
That was the worst
and the best moment of my life.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.004
OK.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.886
Is this ready?

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.280
Yeah.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.486
- I'll be downstairs in a bit.
- OK.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.445
What have you got?

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.125
Chardonnay.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.247
- It's good, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.961
You know that I'm full of shit, right?

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.327
Depends on the day.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.963
But you know that I love you, hmm?

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.085
Say good-bye to Aunt Em, OK?

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:39.049
OK.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.249
Good-bye, chickadee.
You make sure that they behave, OK?

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.169
- OK.
- OK, kiss.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.280
What time is it in France?

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.568
Um, it is past your bedtime.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.370
Why?

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.045
Don't be a stranger.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.642
I won't.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.925
I don't want to go to bed.
It's still light out.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.048
You don't have to go to bed, sweetie.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.725
Be good, OK?
I'll be back.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.609
When is Auntie Em coming back?

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.240
She'll be back next summer.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.649
