08:37.225 --> 08:40.020
[recorder music]

08:40.061 --> 08:41.771
[high-pitched tone]

08:41.813 --> 08:42.981
Stephanie?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.191
Yes, Michelle?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.526
You are not good.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.570
Well, it's just

08:48.195 --> 08:49.570
she's missing one note.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.990
Here, I'll show you

08:49.612 --> 08:51.990
the note. Observe.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.618
[recorder music]

08:55.660 --> 08:57.162
[high-pitched tone]

08:58.705 --> 09:00.248
[high-pitched tone]

09:00.290 --> 09:03.377
You are not good too.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.299
Wait a minute.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.299
Something's stuck in here.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.467
[blowing]

09:13.845 --> 09:15.930
That's where

09:13.845 --> 09:15.930
I stuck my gum.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.894
That is not funny.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.022
[instrumental music]

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
Oh, look at that, Comet,

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
you can see yourself.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.198
That's what I get

09:31.405 --> 09:33.198
for showing off.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.368
Doing dishes?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.745
Another big Saturday,

09:36.410 --> 09:38.745
huh, Mr. T.?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.955
It's good

09:38.786 --> 09:40.955
to see you too, Kimmy.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.750
D.J., you missed lunch.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.750
But I saved you a sandwich.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.753
Oh, well, great.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.753
Thanks, dad.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.506
Hey, check out my new bathing

09:46.794 --> 09:49.506
suit for my pool party.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.011
It's you, Kimmy. Loud.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.055
D.J., eat up.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.055
We're all going to the gym.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.684
I'm skipping lunch.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.684
Do you want my sandwich?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.603
Yeah, sure.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.939
Ham again?

10:05.980 --> 10:07.566
I've been eating

10:05.980 --> 10:07.566
your lunch for three days.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.776
And every sandwich

10:07.607 --> 10:09.776
is ham.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.903
Did your dad

10:09.817 --> 10:11.903
hit a pig with his car?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.532
Goodbye, Kimmy.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.538
D.J., you're giving

10:18.034 --> 10:21.538
your lunches to Kimmy?

10:21.580 --> 10:22.997
Yeah, so what?

10:23.039 --> 10:26.251
You've been skipping breakfast

10:23.039 --> 10:26.251
and dinner too.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.463
I'm not an expert on this,

10:26.293 --> 10:29.463
but shouldn't a person eat?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.425
Uh, you're right, Steph.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.425
I'll eat my sandwich.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.052
- You promise?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.052
- I promise.

10:37.762 --> 10:41.516
Much better. Now get yourself

10:37.762 --> 10:41.516
an apple and a glass of milk.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.560
And your basic food groups

10:41.558 --> 10:43.560
are covered.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.776
Come here, Comet.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.776
Look, what I have for you.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.987
People food.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.987
No. Come here.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.576
You're lucky.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.702
Dogs don't have to wear

10:59.618 --> 11:01.702
bathing suits.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.540
[intense music]

11:12.422 --> 11:14.508
D.J., you promised

11:12.422 --> 11:14.508
you'd eat your sandwich.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.842
You lied.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.219
Comet, stole it

11:15.883 --> 11:18.219
right out of my hand.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.762
You're lying again.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.014
No, I'm not.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.017
Lie number three.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.017
When will this end?

11:24.058 --> 11:26.853
Look, Steph, I've got one week

11:24.058 --> 11:26.853
to look good in a bathing suit

11:26.894 --> 11:28.896
in front of my friends.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.983
Now when the party's over,

11:28.938 --> 11:31.983
I'll start eating again.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.986
But until then,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.986
this is our secret.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.739
- Now give me your pinkie.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.739
- No, not the pinkie.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.408
Yes, the pinkie.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.869
You have to pinkie swear

11:40.450 --> 11:42.869
that you won't tell anyone

11:42.910 --> 11:45.497
I haven't been eating.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.497
Now hook up.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.463
Now, say it.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.463
Pinkie swear.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.924
Pinkie swear.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.924
But, I don't like it.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.052
Well, too bad.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.052
Your lips are sealed.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.900
It smells like

12:09.770 --> 12:13.900
a sweat sock in here.

12:13.941 --> 12:18.238
Yeah, these

12:13.941 --> 12:18.238
are my people.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.990
What do you bench,

12:18.279 --> 12:20.990
dude?

12:21.032 --> 12:23.034
Five-O-five.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.494
Beginner, huh?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.330
It's cool.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.831
It better be.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.127
Hey, mister,

12:30.124 --> 12:33.127
you are very lumpy.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.093
I hope you're

12:38.216 --> 12:40.093
not offended.

12:40.134 --> 12:44.138
But if you are,

12:40.134 --> 12:44.138
that's her father, right there.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.933
So, what's the best way

12:44.180 --> 12:46.933
to burn off calories?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.727
Well, you make it fun.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.019
You can ride a bike.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.105
I loved riding bike

12:50.061 --> 12:52.105
when I was a kid.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.607
Of course,

12:52.146 --> 12:53.607
my banana-seat huffy

12:53.648 --> 12:55.734
didn't have

12:53.648 --> 12:55.734
an onboard computer.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.277
Sweetheart, start off slow,

12:55.774 --> 12:57.277
on level one.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.362
You don't wanna do

12:57.318 --> 12:59.362
too much too soon, okay?

12:59.404 --> 13:00.863
Got it.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.990
Come on, Steph, let's go stretch

13:00.905 --> 13:02.990
before aerobics class.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.452
To the kiddie gym.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.452
Boys, follow me.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.455
One, two, one, two,

13:05.493 --> 13:08.455
one, two, one, two.

13:08.496 --> 13:12.292
One, two, one, two,

13:08.496 --> 13:12.292
one, two, one, two.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.429
Hi, Zachary.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.556
Hi, Kelsey.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.933
Hi, kid I don't know.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.977
Alright, Michelle,

13:28.975 --> 13:30.977
show us your stuff.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.811
Here, loosen up, first.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.314
One.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.274
Two.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.858
Three.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.736
Ready, Freddy.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.571
Michelle Tanner,

13:39.778 --> 13:41.571
will now compete

13:41.613 --> 13:44.491
in the iron munchkin

13:41.613 --> 13:44.491
triathlon.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.201
The first event,

13:44.532 --> 13:47.201
ooh, the trampoline.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.538
I love this.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.541
Let's see that again

13:50.580 --> 13:53.541
in slow motion.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.795
[talking in slow motion]

13:53.583 --> 13:56.795
I love this.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.506
[clapping]

13:59.547 --> 14:01.132
Well, okay.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.467
Ooh, the next event.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.968
The balance beam.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.348
Ooh.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.474
Remember, folks

14:09.516 --> 14:12.101
she's working

14:09.516 --> 14:12.101
without a net.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.561
And now for

14:12.143 --> 14:13.561
the big finish.

14:13.603 --> 14:17.106
Michelle, will attempt

14:13.603 --> 14:17.106
a single-tuck somersault

14:17.148 --> 14:18.525
with no twist.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.735
(both)

14:18.566 --> 14:20.735
Ooh.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.363
We need complete silence

14:20.777 --> 14:23.363
as she prepares.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.491
[exhales heavily]

14:27.950 --> 14:29.494
Ooh, she's psyched up.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.329
And..

14:31.371 --> 14:32.872
...there she goes!

14:34.666 --> 14:35.667
Ta-da!

14:35.709 --> 14:38.586
'A perfect 10!'

14:38.628 --> 14:40.129
I am pumped.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.969
[breathing heavily]

14:47.011 --> 14:49.055
Come on, Danny, dig deep.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.055
You can do it.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.306
That's right, you got

14:49.096 --> 14:50.306
one more in you.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.808
Come on, give us one more.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.519
And...two

14:55.936 --> 14:57.564
Take it guys,

14:55.936 --> 14:57.564
take it.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.982
Uhh.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.982
Thanks for pushing me.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.616
[beeping]

15:26.175 --> 15:29.262
[breathing heavily]

15:32.640 --> 15:34.308
Aerobics time.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.437
Come on, boys.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.065
- I'm not going to aerobics.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.065
- Me, neither.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.526
Come on, we don't want

15:41.107 --> 15:43.526
to be late for aerobics.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.028
Me, neither.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.072
Me, neither.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.200
[breathing heavily]

15:56.497 --> 15:58.499
[disco music]

15:58.541 --> 16:00.835
(female #1)

15:58.541 --> 16:00.835
Okay, let's keep it moving

15:58.541 --> 16:00.835
out there.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.837
Work those bodies.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.633
One, two, three, four.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.050
Come on, guys.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.762
Staring at women

16:08.092 --> 16:10.762
is not a workout.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.389
Oh, yeah. It's got my heart

16:10.804 --> 16:13.389
going pretty good.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.142
You guys going

16:15.057 --> 16:16.142
to make it?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.268
(all)

16:16.183 --> 16:17.268
Yes.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.728
Oh, yeah.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.272
Do you always tears in your eyes

16:18.770 --> 16:21.272
when you exercise?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.607
(all)

16:21.314 --> 16:22.607
Yes.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.024
Let's move up front.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.277
Maybe, it'll help

16:24.066 --> 16:26.277
if you can see me better.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.570
Uh, it couldn't hurt.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.823
'Follow me, guys.'

16:29.864 --> 16:32.158
'Move those legs,

16:29.864 --> 16:32.158
boys! Come on!'

16:32.199 --> 16:33.743
'Move it up here!'

16:33.785 --> 16:37.538
Alright, now,

16:33.785 --> 16:37.538
let's crank it up!

16:37.580 --> 16:39.540
One, two, three, four.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.376
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.003
Feel that burn!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.130
'Are you burning?'

16:49.133 --> 16:50.844
Alright, and rest!

16:50.885 --> 16:53.304
[sighing]

16:53.346 --> 16:55.222
D.J's gotta see this.

16:55.264 --> 16:59.018
Alright, now that we're warmed

16:55.264 --> 16:59.018
up, let's start the class.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.020
(all)

16:59.059 --> 17:01.020
Ohh.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.355
(female #1)

17:01.061 --> 17:02.355
'Let's get moving!'

17:02.396 --> 17:05.274
I'm gonna go work out

17:02.396 --> 17:05.274
with Michelle.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.401
I better go with you.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.738
- I better stay here.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.738
- Why?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.824
'Cause I can't move.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.953
Deej, come do aerobics.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.953
You're missing the fun.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.288
I'll be right there.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.462
Dad! D.J.!

17:28.798 --> 17:30.216
D.J., are you okay?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.552
Yeah, I just got

17:30.257 --> 17:32.552
a little dizzy.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.094
Here, drink this.

17:35.805 --> 17:39.893
- How do you feel now, Deej?

17:35.805 --> 17:39.893
- Uh, I'm okay.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.561
I guess,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.561
I just overdid it.

17:41.602 --> 17:45.481
- But, D.J.--

17:41.602 --> 17:45.481
- Steph, I'm okay.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.192
I think we better go get

17:45.523 --> 17:48.192
Michelle and go home.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.318
Come on.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.446
[instrumental music]

17:55.074 --> 17:57.201
Mmm.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.453
- Hi, guys.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.453
- Hey, D.J.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.581
You feeling better

17:59.495 --> 18:01.581
after your nap, honey?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.165
Yeah, I'm good as new.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.585
- Are you sure?

18:03.207 --> 18:05.585
- Yes, I'm sure.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.336
Are you really sure?

18:07.378 --> 18:10.590
Would everybody quit making

18:07.378 --> 18:10.590
such a big deal about this?

18:10.631 --> 18:13.467
Deej, I made your favorite

18:10.631 --> 18:13.467
chicken parmesan.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.970
Come here

18:13.509 --> 18:15.970
and check out this sauce.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.348
I...can't.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.348
I just brushed my teeth.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.934
Before dinner?

18:20.975 --> 18:24.562
Doesn't anybody care about

18:20.975 --> 18:24.562
dental hygiene around here?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.313
Whoa, D.J., calm down!

18:26.355 --> 18:27.565
I happen to care

18:26.355 --> 18:27.565
very deeply

18:27.607 --> 18:30.109
about our family's

18:27.607 --> 18:30.109
teeth and gums.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.195
- Now what's going on?

18:30.150 --> 18:33.195
- Nothing is going on.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.573
I'm going to Kimmy's

18:33.237 --> 18:35.573
for dinner.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.408
Don't believe her, dad.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.910
Steph, you pinkie swore.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.871
I don't care. I don't

18:38.952 --> 18:41.871
want you to get sick.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.791
Dad, I know why D.J.'s

18:41.913 --> 18:44.791
acting so cranky

18:44.832 --> 18:46.542
and why she got dizzy today.

18:46.584 --> 18:50.212
She hasn't eaten anything

18:46.584 --> 18:50.212
in three days.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.839
Is that true?

18:51.881 --> 18:54.341
You haven't eaten anything

18:51.881 --> 18:54.341
in three days?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.886
D.J., I think you should

18:54.383 --> 18:56.886
sit down and eat right now.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.514
I can't. I'm finally

18:56.928 --> 19:00.514
starting to lose weight.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.975
D.J., you're starving

19:00.556 --> 19:01.975
yourself.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.435
You could do serious damage

19:02.016 --> 19:04.435
to your body.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.229
Deej, this kinda behavior can

19:04.477 --> 19:07.229
lead to serious eating disorders

19:07.271 --> 19:08.940
anorexia, bulimia.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.858
You're headed down

19:08.982 --> 19:10.858
a dangerous road here.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.276
I don't care.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.527
I'm the one that has to wear

19:13.569 --> 19:14.904
the bathing suit next week.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.406
It's my life and I can do

19:14.946 --> 19:17.406
whatever I want.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.036
Deej, hang on a minute.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.413
I hope she's not mad at me.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.041
Nah, you did

19:24.455 --> 19:27.041
the right thing.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.251
She's lucky to have

19:27.083 --> 19:29.251
a sister like you.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.922
D.J., we have to talk.

19:32.964 --> 19:37.510
You don't understand.

19:32.964 --> 19:37.510
I don't like the way I look.

19:37.551 --> 19:41.055
I want to look

19:37.551 --> 19:41.055
like these models.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.016
Why?

19:43.057 --> 19:45.935
Because they're beautiful.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.645
Well, so are you.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.188
Oh, yeah?

19:49.229 --> 19:52.025
Well, show me one girl in here

19:49.229 --> 19:52.025
with this round face

19:52.066 --> 19:54.110
and these

19:52.066 --> 19:54.110
Charlie Brown cheeks.

19:56.278 --> 20:01.450
Honey, people come in all

19:56.278 --> 20:01.450
different shapes and sizes.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.328
Everybody wishes

20:03.077 --> 20:04.328
they could change

20:04.370 --> 20:07.123
something

20:04.370 --> 20:07.123
about themselves.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.083
Heck, when I was a kid

20:09.125 --> 20:10.835
I wished I'd could have been

20:09.125 --> 20:10.835
more like that guy

20:10.877 --> 20:13.546
on "The Incredible Hulk."

20:13.587 --> 20:17.591
You want to be a big green

20:13.587 --> 20:17.591
monster with muscles?

20:17.633 --> 20:21.261
No, not him. The other guy the

20:17.633 --> 20:21.261
guy that turned into the Hulk.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.556
[sighing]

20:21.303 --> 20:23.556
He was just

20:21.303 --> 20:23.556
nice and average.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.185
He wasn't too tall,

20:23.597 --> 20:27.185
wasn't too skinny.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.437
He didn't stick out

20:27.226 --> 20:30.437
like I thought I did.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.566
Then I realized he didn't have

20:30.479 --> 20:33.566
it so easy, either.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.569
Every time he lost his temper,

20:33.607 --> 20:36.569
he had to buy a new shirt.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.615
Well, you made me smile

20:39.321 --> 20:41.615
but there's still no way

20:41.657 --> 20:44.243
I'm wearing a bathing suit

20:41.657 --> 20:44.243
in front of my friends.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.957
Okay. Lemme ask you

20:47.121 --> 20:49.957
a question.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.128
Why do you

20:51.959 --> 20:54.128
like your friends?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.632
Because they're nice

20:55.504 --> 20:58.632
and we have fun together.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.801
And we do stuff

20:58.674 --> 21:00.801
for each other.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.845
Not because they all

21:00.843 --> 21:02.845
look like models?

21:04.722 --> 21:07.058
No.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.894
Maybe, that's because

21:07.100 --> 21:09.894
deep down inside you know

21:09.936 --> 21:12.188
that how a person

21:09.936 --> 21:12.188
looks on the outside

21:12.230 --> 21:13.606
isn't nearly

21:12.230 --> 21:13.606
as important

21:13.647 --> 21:17.359
as who they are

21:13.647 --> 21:17.359
on the inside, right?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.489
Right.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.993
Honey, I just w-wish

21:22.531 --> 21:25.993
you would try to see yourself

21:26.035 --> 21:28.579
the way

21:26.035 --> 21:28.579
you see your friends.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.750
Deej, you got

21:28.621 --> 21:32.750
such a good heart.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.418
You care about people.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.046
That's why people

21:34.460 --> 21:37.046
care about you.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.840
And everybody

21:37.088 --> 21:39.840
who knows the real D.J.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.759
Thinks she's pretty terrific.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.347
Thanks, dad.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.347
I love you.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.558
I love you too.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.769
That's why I want you

21:49.600 --> 21:51.769
to take care of yourself.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.147
I want you to promise me

21:51.811 --> 21:54.147
that you're gonna eat healthy

21:54.188 --> 21:56.274
and exercise the right way.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.943
I promise.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.943
No more crash diets.

21:58.985 --> 22:03.363
I'm gonna go to Kimmy's party

21:58.985 --> 22:03.363
and have fun with my friends.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.993
Great. Anything else

22:03.405 --> 22:06.993
you wanna talk about?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.911
Yeah.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.911
Is dinner ready?

22:08.953 --> 22:11.538
[chuckling]

22:08.953 --> 22:11.538
Let's go check.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.707
[sighing]

22:13.749 --> 22:16.043
Well, first,

22:13.749 --> 22:16.043
I'll start out with a salad

22:16.085 --> 22:17.128
dressing on the side.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.880
- Ooh.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.880
- A roll with no butter.
