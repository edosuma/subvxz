WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:04.880
Thanks for
baby-sitting, Meg.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.423
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.800
I don't understand
why I have to baby-sit Stewie.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.469
I mean, what's he
really gonna do

00:10.552 --> 00:11.887
If we leave him
by himself?

00:11.970 --> 00:14.598
And now to test
my teleportation pods.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.808
(machine beeping)

00:16.892 --> 00:18.769
-(alarm blaring)
-Oh, damn!

00:22.439 --> 00:23.982
(screaming)

00:24.066 --> 00:25.984
I'm a monster!

00:26.068 --> 00:29.780
It seems today
that all you see

00:29.863 --> 00:33.158
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:33.242 --> 00:36.662
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:36.745 --> 00:39.498
On which we used to rely?

00:39.581 --> 00:43.043
Lucky there's a family guy

00:43.126 --> 00:46.547
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:46.630 --> 00:48.173
All the things
that make us

00:48.257 --> 00:49.716
Laugh and cry

00:49.800 --> 00:54.930
He's a family guy

01:01.687 --> 01:05.691
So, um, this, is,
uh, awkward,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.235
but, uh, have--have
we ever actually, you know,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.361
met?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.697
I mean, y-you know,
I don't even know, say,

01:11.780 --> 01:14.157
for example,
if you have a room up there.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.368
You know, a room?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.203
I have a room.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.039
You know, Meg,
if you kill yourself now,

01:21.123 --> 01:23.709
you'll probably
get a full page in the yearbook.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.545
So, um, you know,
that's something to think about.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.005
(burps)
Oh, just burped.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.214
(doorbell rings)

01:29.298 --> 01:30.340
Hi, Meg.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.551
(lisping)
You busy Saturday night?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.178
Neil, you ask me out,
like, once a day,

01:34.261 --> 01:35.929
and I always give you
the same answer.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.139
No!

01:37.222 --> 01:39.474
God, I don't think
I could have been any clearer

01:39.558 --> 01:41.059
the last time
I turned him down.

01:41.143 --> 01:44.438
Ray, your mother insulted
my steak pizzaiola again.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.982
Neil Goldman of Quahog,
Rhode Island,

01:47.065 --> 01:48.567
leave me alone!

01:48.650 --> 01:51.778
I hate you! I hate you!

01:51.862 --> 01:53.530
Anyway,
your mother insulted--

01:53.614 --> 01:54.823
I don't care
anymore, Patty.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.534
After nine seasons,
I just don't care.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.662
Maybe you could try
not being a bitch.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.755
Hey, Mort.
Uh, Lois and I are out on our date night.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.256
Uh, why don't you
give me some condoms?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.466
A-and some Excedrin.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.385
My wife's got
a headache this big.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.679
You know, it's-- it's like
from the commercial.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.390
This big.
Only--only it's my junk.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.143
All right, then.
$12.43.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.522
Oh, jeez, that's more of a rip-off
than that breakfast machine I bought.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.735
Song.

02:48.961 --> 02:49.962
(gun fires)

02:50.045 --> 02:52.631
Ah! Ow! Ow!

02:52.714 --> 02:54.424
What was the point
of all that?

02:54.508 --> 02:55.551
(groans)

02:55.634 --> 02:57.636
All it does
is shoot you.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.429
It doesn't make
breakfast at all.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.639
(groaning)

03:00.722 --> 03:01.890
Besides, I forgot my wallet.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.518
Well, that's okay.
I'll just open up a tab.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.727
Wait a minute,
what the hell's a tab?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.062
Does that mean
I don't gotta pay?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.188
Well, not
right now, but--

03:08.272 --> 03:10.107
Oh, sweet!

03:10.190 --> 03:12.067
Hey, while I'm at it,
give me all these copies of Marie Claire.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.861
You know, in case I want
to rub out that easy one

03:13.944 --> 03:15.529
before I get Lois
into bed tonight.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.865
Kathleen Turner's
on page 45.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.449
Kathleen Turner, huh?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.909
Let's see how she looks.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.494
Oh, that's a shame.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.456
MALE HOST:
and now back to the kids' choice awards

03:26.540 --> 03:28.208
with host Paula Poundstone.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.253
I choose you and you and you.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.504
So, come on.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.257
I said, let's go!

03:35.340 --> 03:37.301
(kids whining)

03:37.384 --> 03:39.845
(whimpering)

03:39.928 --> 03:41.263
STEWIE:
Meg!

03:41.346 --> 03:43.557
Meg, I'm hungry!

03:43.640 --> 03:45.851
There's a granola bar
in the cupboard.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.060
I want it.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.980
Hey.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.273
Hey.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.524
What's this?

03:52.608 --> 03:53.859
What's going on?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.485
Am I talking to myself
up there?

03:55.569 --> 03:56.570
Oh, my god.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.530
Stewie, just shut up
and go to bed!

03:58.614 --> 03:59.907
Do you know what I do, Meg?

03:59.990 --> 04:01.950
I spit in your mouth
while you sleep.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.370
Finally. Look, Mom,
I've had it.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.830
I am not
baby-sitting anymore.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.583
It's Saturday night,
I could be out having a life.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.002
Meg, if you don't want
to baby-sit anymore, that's fine.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.505
But don't you
stand there and lie to me.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.007
(chuckling)
Oh, Meg, she torched your ass, man.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.383
She torched your ass.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.636
Why can't you just
hire a real baby-sitter?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.429
Well, I guess
we could do that.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.765
Damn! I'm terrible
at meeting new people.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.558
Like the time
I was on Blind Date.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.310
I'm having
a great time, Stewie.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.561
Me, too.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.897
So, you ready
to go grab some 'za?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.607
Uh, yeah.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.194
(beeping)

04:39.071 --> 04:40.822
So, uh, a wild guess here

04:40.906 --> 04:43.867
but from the looks of your arm hair,
I'm guessing you're Italian?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.416
All right, you guys,
I got eight crates of ipecac from Mort,

04:51.500 --> 04:52.668
all on my tab.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.711
Now, whoever goes the longest
without puking

04:54.795 --> 04:56.797
gets the last piece
of pie in the fridge.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.259
Okay, here we go.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.387
How's everybody doing?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.471
Good.
Good so far.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.931
All right,
all right.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.015
Nothing yet.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.267
Cool, cool.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.936
You know, I--I don't know if you guys had
any of that pie already,

05:11.019 --> 05:13.772
But that is, uh,
that is some tasty stuff.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.190
That's from the, uh,
bake sale that Lois--

05:17.192 --> 05:19.945
Ooh, one down.
I know somebody who won't be having any--

05:21.697 --> 05:23.490
I'm starting
to feel funny.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.908
Well, I feel fine.
I guess I'm--

05:26.702 --> 05:30.038
Oh, boy!
That means I win. I get to eat--

05:32.124 --> 05:33.125
(gasping)

05:33.208 --> 05:35.878
Oh, god! Why didn't
anybody tell me...

05:37.462 --> 05:39.715
Oh, my god!
My insides are on--

05:41.300 --> 05:44.011
No. No, please.
No more, no more. No--

05:45.095 --> 05:47.222
Dad, I'm scared.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.726
Get the phone.
Call 911--

05:51.810 --> 05:54.229
Lois! Lois! Lois,
get in here...

05:55.272 --> 05:56.481
(gasps)

05:56.565 --> 05:58.734
(panting)
Okay, okay. I think it's all gone.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.527
I think--

06:01.570 --> 06:04.489
(crying)
I don't wanna, I don't wanna...

06:04.573 --> 06:06.992
Peter. Peter,
I need you to hold my ears...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.163
Oh, oh.

06:11.246 --> 06:16.001
(all groaning)

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Who wants chowder?

06:22.257 --> 06:23.509
What the hell?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.385
Hey, Meg,
you better check this out.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.929
-(airplane engine whirring)
-(gasps)

06:46.615 --> 06:49.076
Oh, god, this is
so embarrassing.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.911
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.331
Oh, looks like someone could use
a greeting card to cheer them up.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.541
I put these on my tab.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.917
Here, take a Far Side one.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.002
The vulture thinks
he's a cowboy.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.713
It's kind of funny.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.465
Hey, Peter,
you got a card for

07:03.549 --> 07:05.384
if you transferred V.D.
To somebody?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.052
Uh, let's see here, uh...

07:07.135 --> 07:09.888
Yup. "Sorry
I accidentally gave you V.D."

07:09.972 --> 07:11.640
Oh, that's all you got
is accidental, huh?

07:11.723 --> 07:12.850
All right,
I'll take it.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.602
Well, first let me thank you
for answering the ad.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.729
Now, what do you
feel qualifies you

07:17.813 --> 07:19.731
to be an effective
baby-sitter for Stewie?

07:19.815 --> 07:22.401
(speaking in
Portuguese)

07:22.484 --> 07:27.030
Uh, yeah. Uh, we couldn't
run an ad that said "no Portuguese,"

07:27.114 --> 07:28.323
but, um...

07:29.366 --> 07:31.243
no Portuguese.

07:32.494 --> 07:36.039
So, I see here you worked for a family
for a number of years.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.459
Can I call
the, uh, Herculoids for a reference?

07:39.543 --> 07:40.836
(chattering)

07:40.919 --> 07:42.588
I-I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.173
(chattering)

07:44.464 --> 07:45.924
The position has been filled.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.217
(chattering excitedly)

07:47.301 --> 07:48.927
The position
has been filled.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.138
Thank you very much.
You can go now.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.265
(grumbling)

07:53.348 --> 07:54.808
Ahh! Ahh!

07:54.892 --> 07:56.852
Leave! Now!

07:56.935 --> 07:59.897
I didn't think it was gonna be this hard
to choose a baby-sitter.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.523
Yes, if only you
were this discerning

08:01.607 --> 08:04.693
when you picked
that happening Bruce Jenner hairdo.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.279
Sorry I'm late.
Can I still apply for the job?

08:09.198 --> 08:10.199
Song.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.120
My god, I haven't
been this exhilarated

08:15.204 --> 08:17.664
since Brian took me
to see Les Miserables.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.166
ANNOUNCER:
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.543
There will be a slight change
in the cast tonight.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.170
Oh, no.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.464
ANNOUNCER: For this evening's performance
the role of Jean Valjean

08:25.547 --> 08:27.591
will be played
by Kirk Cameron.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.426
Oh! Oh!

08:29.510 --> 08:31.553
Unbelievable!
Oh, my god!

08:31.637 --> 08:33.347
How lucky
are we, huh?

08:33.430 --> 08:35.140
"Hey, Stewie,
what are you doing tonight?"

08:35.224 --> 08:38.435
"Oh, nothing. Just watching
Kirk Cameron play Jean Valjean."

08:38.519 --> 08:40.979
Oh, my god!
Curtain up.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.776
Hey, Mort, do these suppositories come
in other flavors?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.069
Peter, are you
eating those?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.779
No, I'm shoving them
up my butt.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.239
Of course I'm eating them.
Give me a carton.

08:50.322 --> 08:53.450
Peter, it's the end of the month,
and I'm calling your tab.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.203
You owe me
$34,000.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.329
What?

08:57.412 --> 08:59.414
Oh, man, how am I
gonna come up with that kind of money?

08:59.498 --> 09:01.416
Peter, I'm waiting.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.921
All right, all right.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.089
Listen, I got another idea.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.257
What if I sold you
my daughter?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.341
Huh?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.677
You drop the tab,
and your son can have Meg.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.845
MEG:
What?

09:12.928 --> 09:14.763
Yep, all you gotta do
is sign this contract.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.223
Are you out
of your mind?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.475
You can't sell me,
you fat son of a bitch!

09:18.559 --> 09:21.478
Whoa! Careful
getting this fish off the hook, Mort.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.605
She's got some fangs.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.898
What do you
think of that, Neil?

09:24.982 --> 09:26.358
Daddy bought you
a girlfriend.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.195
Excuse me. If anybody is interested,
I already have a girlfriend.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.364
There's no way...
Wait, what?

09:32.447 --> 09:33.615
You ready to go, honey?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.701
You rejected me
too many times, Meg.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.035
I couldn't wait
for you forever.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.789
Besides, Cecilia thinks
my psoriasis is sexy.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.666
I can't believe he's over me.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.960
I can't believe
I'm out $34,000.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.712
I can't believe
it's not butter.

09:46.795 --> 09:47.838
(chuckles)

09:47.921 --> 09:49.631
Stick around.
More Family Guy coming up.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.099
Peter, how could you
have tried to sell our daughter?

09:59.183 --> 10:01.560
All right, Lois,
I don't want this to ruin our date night,

10:01.643 --> 10:03.645
so I'll make it
up to you.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.063
Oh, Peter.

10:05.147 --> 10:08.150
"I'm sorry I tried
to sell our daughter."

10:08.233 --> 10:09.610
Yeah, you don't know
how hard it was

10:09.693 --> 10:11.069
to find one of those
in English.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.489
(sighing)
Tonight the baby-sitter comes, Rupert.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.657
Lovely Ladawn.

10:15.741 --> 10:16.950
Mmm.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.662
Oh, hey, Ladawn.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.122
Hey, what's going on?
How are you?

10:22.206 --> 10:24.124
Yeah. Oh, just me, Stewie.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.168
Just, uh,
being myself.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.671
Uh, yeah. Oh, oh, well, this here?
Oh, it's just my package.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.548
Yeah, just--just, uh,

10:31.632 --> 10:32.633
just, uh, my package.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
God delivered it,
I signed for it.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.429
World keeps on
spinning. Yeah.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.641
Oh, no!

10:40.724 --> 10:42.267
Oh, Jenga,
there it is.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.852
(laughing)
Oh, oh,

10:43.936 --> 10:46.855
well, I guess that's why
they call it Jenga. Mmm?

10:46.939 --> 10:49.733
Stewie, you're so cute,
I can't even stand it.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.860
Oh, thank you.
I'm having a good time, too.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.529
I hope I don't make
any social faux pas

10:53.612 --> 10:56.865
like I did at Pamela
and Tommy Lee's dinner party.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.242
Hi, sorry I'm late.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.826
I was visiting my aunt
in the hospital.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.580
She has
hep...a...titis.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.333
Ooh.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.626
Sorry.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.758
CECILIA:
Neil is such an amazing guy.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.094
We just make
an absolutely perfect couple.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.137
You know,
Neil liked me first.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.889
And I was gonna
go out with him

11:20.973 --> 11:22.641
when I was ready
to settle for him.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.810
Get your own spaz.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.562
All right, ladies,
enough chitchat.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.523
Take it off, get in the shower
and bounce around for me.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.653
Sweetie, your daddy
and I are going to the movies tonight.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.321
How would you like
Ladawn to baby-sit?

11:36.405 --> 11:39.199
Yes! I'm going to wow
her tonight, Rupert.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.742
I'm gonna be
cooler than Brian

11:40.826 --> 11:42.327
when he hangs out
at the bowling alley.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.955
That's what I love
about high-school girls.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.750
I keep getting older,
they stay the same age.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.461
(chuckling)
Yes, they do. Yes, they do.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.174
Please go out with me.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.633
I'm just trying
to make Neil jealous.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.594
I promise, I'll pay
and everything.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.429
Yeah. Uh,
that sounds cool,

12:00.512 --> 12:02.472
but I'm gonna be
in the hospital that night.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.185
(groaning)

12:10.564 --> 12:12.858
(continues groaning)

12:14.276 --> 12:15.402
(doorbell rings)

12:16.403 --> 12:18.238
Hi, gorgeous man.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.907
Oh, you.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.701
Must I lock up your tongue
with the rest of the silver?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.537
Stewie,
this is Jeremy.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.206
Hey, little man.
So you're the guy

12:27.289 --> 12:29.166
Who's been trying
to steal my girlfriend.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.250
What-- You--

12:30.334 --> 12:31.793
Girlfriend?

12:31.877 --> 12:34.129
What kind of sick,
twisted game are you playing at?

12:34.213 --> 12:35.923
Stewie sounds
a little cranky.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.216
I'll put him to bed.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.760
Ha! I got your hat!
Take that, hatless!

12:39.843 --> 12:42.971
Now go back to the quad
and resume your hacky sack tourney!

12:43.055 --> 12:45.432
I'm not gonna lie down
for some frat-boy bastard

12:45.516 --> 12:48.268
with his damn Teva Sandals
and his Skoal Bandits

12:48.352 --> 12:51.980
and his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeved
open-stitched crew-neck Henley

12:52.064 --> 12:53.857
smoking his sticky buds
out of a soda can

12:53.941 --> 12:57.361
while watching his favorite downloaded
Simpsons episodes every night!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.820
Yes, we all love Mr. Plow.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.656
Oh, you've got
the song memorized, do you?

13:00.739 --> 13:01.865
So does everyone else!

13:01.949 --> 13:03.909
That is exactly
the kind of idiot you see

13:03.992 --> 13:05.577
at Taco Bell
at one in the morning.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.330
The guy who just
whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.831
Good night, Stewie.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.167
If he wants to throw hands,
I'll throw hands.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.544
I tell you...

13:13.627 --> 13:15.504
(mumbling)

13:15.587 --> 13:16.630
(groans)

13:16.713 --> 13:17.714
(sucking)

13:21.885 --> 13:24.638
Oh, hey!
Neil and Cecilia.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.348
I didn't expect
to see you here.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.308
Meet Jake,
my boyfriend.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.601
I want some BBs.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.186
My dad lets me
shoot at cats.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.354
Oh, hi, Meg.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.732
Neil and I
are celebrating our two-week anniversary.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.234
Oh, it seems like
only yesterday

13:37.317 --> 13:40.153
he was just a stranger
videotaping me through the window.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.321
Big deal.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.781
He did that to me
3 years ago.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.950
And he gave me
the tapes for Christmas.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.702
He gave me DVDs.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.662
The production values
were amazing,

13:48.745 --> 13:50.539
much better than
Kramer vs. Predator.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.790
You want him back?

13:51.874 --> 13:54.042
You can't just disappear for 3 months
and then suddenly decide

13:54.126 --> 13:56.545
you want him back!
You can't have him!

14:00.382 --> 14:02.718
Well, I'm glad
Neil's over me, anyway.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.469
I'm with Jake now.
Right, Jake?

14:04.553 --> 14:08.182
Maybe someday
we'll get married and you can go up on me.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.058
Neil, I wanna be
your girlfriend.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.853
-What?
-I was wrong to drive you away.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.062
We belong together.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.106
Of course,
I'm understandably skeptical

14:16.190 --> 14:18.025
of your newfound
affection for me.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.819
You still got
that contract our dads drew up?

14:20.903 --> 14:22.196
Give me that.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.242
You wanna hook up?

14:27.326 --> 14:28.452
Buy me something.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.669
Oh, I can't believe
we're going out.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.379
This is so cool.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.217
Oh, Neil. Neil,
n-not--not so fast.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.635
(tittering)
Uh, Meg,

14:44.718 --> 14:47.054
you need
to fulfill your contractual obligations.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.222
What are you
talking about?

14:48.305 --> 14:50.098
(laughing lecherously)

14:50.182 --> 14:52.476
All right, Meg,
according to the contract,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.978
every night,
you have to put on my pajamas.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.855
My mom's record
is 12 seconds.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.357
Neil, I think you're
old enough to--

14:58.440 --> 14:59.441
Go!

14:59.525 --> 15:00.651
-(giggling)
-Neil, would you stop kicking?

15:00.734 --> 15:01.735
-Ooh, that's tickling. It tickles.
-Just hold still.

15:01.818 --> 15:02.945
Ow, my thumb.
Hold still.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.738
-(exclaiming)
-Quit it. No. Ah!

15:07.658 --> 15:10.369
Oh, Ladawn, I thought
we could watch a DVD Together.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.080
I picked up the first season
of Jiminy Glick.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.998
Imagine being
that guy for a day.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.291
Colin Farrell,

15:16.375 --> 15:18.877
so I was talking to my wife,
Dixie, the other day

15:18.961 --> 15:21.797
and she was saying
that you weren't a very good actor.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.507
And I agreed with her.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.594
Now--now, why, now, why,
Colin, why would we both say that?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.515
All right, that's it.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.183
Jeremy must be destroyed.

15:40.649 --> 15:41.650
Mom?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.068
(footsteps pattering)

15:43.986 --> 15:45.028
Dad?

15:45.112 --> 15:47.531
Mom? Is anyone there?

15:50.158 --> 15:54.204
Uh, little man?
You--you in here?

16:02.087 --> 16:03.172
(bellowing)

16:03.255 --> 16:05.215
(screaming) Ow!

16:05.299 --> 16:07.176
I say, I think this is
how you change a tire.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.595
But what do I know?
I'm just a baby!

16:11.555 --> 16:13.348
Here's your iPod,
so you can listen

16:13.432 --> 16:15.100
to The Streaks
while you gasp for air.

16:15.184 --> 16:16.185
(muffled)

16:16.351 --> 16:17.561
Oh, the Strokes. Right.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.399
Boy, this was
a better acquisition than I thought.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.444
We may even be able
to put in some sorghum this year.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.909
So, uh,
anyway, um...

16:31.992 --> 16:33.410
Hey, I made you
a mix tape.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.912
I don't have
a dual cassette player

16:34.995 --> 16:37.581
so, you know, I had to hold
the tape recorder up to the radio,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.416
so the quality
is kind of sucky

16:39.499 --> 16:41.877
but, you know,
all the songs describe my feelings.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.086
(sobbing)
Oh.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.340
I'm sorry, Stewie.
I'm just upset.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.425
Jeremy stopped
calling me.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.469
He what?
That blaggard!

16:50.552 --> 16:53.972
Oh, come here, l-let me just--
let me just hold you for a while.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.269
Stewie! No! That is
a bad place to touch.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.480
No. No, no, no,
no, no. No.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.148
But--but--but...

17:03.232 --> 17:05.150
(stammering)
But I... You... I...

17:06.151 --> 17:08.362
(wailing)

17:08.445 --> 17:09.738
No more TV.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.490
Well, how about
no more job? Hmm?

17:11.573 --> 17:12.741
You hear that,
miss fussy britches?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.910
I shall see you fired,
damn you!

17:14.993 --> 17:16.912
I thought we were
going to go all the way

17:16.995 --> 17:19.248
and die together
like Hitler and Eva Braun.

17:19.331 --> 17:20.582
(gun firing)

17:20.666 --> 17:22.292
We do everything
together, ja?

17:22.376 --> 17:23.377
Ja.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.461
You got your poison?
Mmm.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.172
Okay. One, two, three.

17:28.257 --> 17:29.424
You--you didn't do it.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.009
You didn't do it,
either.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.428
Okay, okay. All right,
this time we really have to do it.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.556
-Okay, all right. You ready? Okay, okay.
-Okay.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.225
BOTH:
One, two.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.561
Ah!
Ah!

17:41.770 --> 17:45.274
You want me to kill myself
and you're not going to.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.818
You suck. You suck.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.027
You suck.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.783
Hey, Stewie,
there's, uh, something

17:54.867 --> 17:56.618
thunking around in
the trunk of my car

17:56.702 --> 17:58.704
and I can't get in there
'cause somebody busted the lock.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.455
You--you have, uh,
any idea what that's about?

18:00.539 --> 18:03.000
Oh, oh, that.
It's this whole...

18:03.083 --> 18:04.084
(clicks tongue)

18:04.168 --> 18:06.753
It's this whole
crazy thing.

18:09.923 --> 18:10.924
(clanging)

18:11.008 --> 18:12.551
Hey, this is not a barn,
young lady.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.928
Oh, I'm just
so exhausted.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.847
You know, I thought
I'd be happy being with Neil,

18:16.930 --> 18:17.973
but I'm not.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.266
This is horrible.

18:19.349 --> 18:22.019
Oh, sweetheart, we'll figure some way
to get you out of this.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.229
Brian,
did you find any loophole in the contract?

18:24.313 --> 18:25.522
Nope, it's airtight.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.691
The only way out
is if Neil commits an infidelity.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.817
Well, that's it then.

18:28.901 --> 18:31.153
We got to find
somebody to seduce Neil.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.404
Who, me?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.947
Well, if not you, Lois,
then who?

18:34.031 --> 18:35.490
Beverly D'Angelo?

18:35.574 --> 18:37.159
'Cause I don't think
she'd do it.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.286
And I don't even know
how to get a hold of her.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.916
Oh, hello, Ladawn.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.542
Listen, I certainly hope
you'll excuse

18:45.626 --> 18:46.752
last night's
indiscretion.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.670
It was just...
Oh, my god, Ladawn!

18:48.754 --> 18:50.214
What's that
on your neck?

18:54.718 --> 18:55.719
Ha!

18:57.095 --> 18:59.097
Lois! Oh, thank god
you're here, Lois.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.516
It was all
her friends.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.935
They--they were doing
marijuana and heroin.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.771
And--and they were
taking eczema and touching each other.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.314
LOIS:
Ladawn, wake up this instant.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.524
What?

19:08.607 --> 19:09.691
I--I don't--

19:09.775 --> 19:11.235
You know what?
Don't bother, Ladawn.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.653
You are fired.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.948
Well, I really don't know
how this happened

19:16.031 --> 19:18.200
but I guess
this is the last time I get to see you.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.286
I... I'm gonna miss you,
little guy.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.248
Oh, this is for you.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.792
She--she made me
a mix tape.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.794
Oh, dear god,
what have I done?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.629
I've made a
terrible mistake.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.299
Ladawn! Ladawn!

19:35.259 --> 19:38.053
Ladawn!

19:39.471 --> 19:40.889
All right,
you all set, honey?

19:40.973 --> 19:42.558
LOIS:
Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this.

19:42.641 --> 19:43.809
It's so disgusting.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.394
But it's for
my little girl.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.229
Dad, how do you know
Neil will show up?

19:47.312 --> 19:48.438
Don't worry, Meg.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.691
I sent him an invitation
he couldn't refuse.

19:55.904 --> 19:56.905
Hmm.

19:56.989 --> 20:01.410
Strange. These conventions
usually have Segway parking.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.079
Hello? Am I too late
for the Q and A?

20:04.162 --> 20:08.208
Yeah, but you're just
in time for the T and A.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.334
(growls seductively)

20:09.418 --> 20:11.128
Mrs. Griffin,
what--what are you--

20:11.211 --> 20:12.421
(shushing)

20:12.504 --> 20:14.590
You can call me mystique.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.675
Mrs. Griffin,
this is wrong.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.927
Well, well, well,
look at this, Meg.

20:19.011 --> 20:22.264
Your boyfriend is violating
both your contract and my wife.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.224
Meg, I wasn't
doing anything.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.102
Uh, Mrs. Griffin was just...
Ow, you're bending it.

20:27.186 --> 20:28.228
I don't care.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.897
You've nullified
the contract.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.940
(laughing triumphantly)
I'm free!

20:32.024 --> 20:33.108
Free?

20:33.192 --> 20:34.818
I don't understand, Meg.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.778
You don't want to be
my girlfriend?

20:36.862 --> 20:37.946
Well, I thought I did.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.907
But I guess
I was just jealous.

20:39.990 --> 20:40.991
I see.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.576
Well, Meg, I want you
to be with me

20:42.659 --> 20:44.161
because you want
to be with me,

20:44.244 --> 20:46.038
not because
you have to.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.373
Thank you, Neil.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.918
Cecilia,
it's the Goldman.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.711
How about we fire up
the old Segway

20:52.794 --> 20:55.506
and find a nice quiet field
to do long division in?

20:55.589 --> 20:57.341
I--I--I mean,
a nice quiet field

20:57.424 --> 21:00.177
in which to do
long division. Sorry.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.553
Sorry, everybody.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.055
Okay, I'm on my way.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.848
He's going back to Cecilia?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.975
I can't believe
I'm actually jealous.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.977
I can't believe
I actually touched him.

21:09.061 --> 21:12.314
I still can't believe
it's not butter.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.358
Next week I run
for Mayor of Quahog.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.609
Do I have what it takes?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.152
We'll find out.
Don't miss it.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.915
Well, here we are again.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.876
Another Saturday night
with basic cable.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.212
Yep.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.799
Oh, I suppose neither of us
is really cut out for love, and we--

21:38.882 --> 21:41.301
Oh, my god!
Jeremy's still in the trunk!

21:41.385 --> 21:42.594
Oh, god, how long
has it been?

21:42.678 --> 21:45.222
Uh, let's-- let's see.
two--two Weeks. Yep.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.306
(clicks tongue)

21:46.390 --> 21:47.724
Yeah, he's dead.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.143
Definitely dead.
