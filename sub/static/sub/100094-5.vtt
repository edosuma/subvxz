WEBVTT

00:25.900 --> 00:29.696
Now this is some prime yurt action.

00:29.779 --> 00:30.739
-[Pat chuckles]
-Whoo!

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
Yeah.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.325
Right? Nothing but the best
for Mark Warren.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.536
-[Mark exhales]
-[Pat chuckles]

00:36.619 --> 00:39.456
-Try not to, uh, kick snow on my rug.
-Ah, okay, I'm sorry.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.540
-I'm sorry.
-[chuckles]

00:40.623 --> 00:43.168
Hey, man. Can you squeeze
any more equipment in here?

00:43.251 --> 00:45.754
I think you're defeating the purpose
of having a see-through yurt.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
-I've seen it before.
-[chuckles]

00:47.881 --> 00:50.633
I sent up a ceiling balloon yesterday
to get a baseline.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.010
And the pyranometer?

00:52.761 --> 00:56.639
Uh, yeah, there's a... there's a clearing.
You'll see. I set it dead center.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.059
-Oh, man. I can't wait to get out there.
-[laughs]

00:59.142 --> 01:01.102
Well, do you want to rest first, or...

01:01.186 --> 01:02.103
No, no, no, I'm fine.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.647
-I mean, I feel great. I want to get--
-[knocking] Come outside.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.524
I'm working,
but, uh, I'll see you tonight.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.109
[Mark] New girl?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.236
Kerry. I met her
the second night I was here.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.489
-Okay.
-She lives in Montana.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.990
-Ah.
-But get this.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.325
-Her friend Jill...
-Okay.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.244
...who, uh, kind of hates me, by the way.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.830
Uh, she has a house on the lake
near your cabin,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.500
and they're going there
right after the aurora.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.626
So...

01:24.709 --> 01:29.798
So you want to borrow the cabin
and ruin the rest of Jill's vacation?

01:30.423 --> 01:32.300
Yes, that's correct.
That's what I want. [laughs]

01:32.383 --> 01:34.677
It's an excellent plan. All right, do it.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.804
I mean, uh, you know...

01:35.887 --> 01:37.972
-Ah, that's cool with you?
-[Mark] Of course.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.391
Unless you want me to be alone
for the rest of my life?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.434
No, I mean, uh...

01:42.018 --> 01:43.770
-I don't plan to be.
-[Pat chuckles]

01:43.853 --> 01:45.188
Yeah, when's the last time you...

01:45.271 --> 01:46.106
Oh.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.607
What? No.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.275
We didn't think about it. We just did it.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.611
Um...

01:51.694 --> 01:53.238
[exhales]

01:53.321 --> 01:54.823
Wow! That-- um....

01:54.906 --> 01:56.825
Congrats. [stammers] I mean...

01:57.700 --> 01:59.869
You've only known her,
like, a couple months, right?

01:59.953 --> 02:02.163
Pat, this is it. She's the one.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.040
Are you sure?

02:04.457 --> 02:06.417
Because she's nothing like
any of the other girls

02:06.501 --> 02:08.545
-you've ever dated.
-I know, right?

02:09.045 --> 02:11.631
Okay, that sounds like I'm saying
it's a good thing.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.341
Um, I, uh...

02:13.758 --> 02:15.593
I th... [sucks in air]

02:15.677 --> 02:17.011
Isn't she kind of...

02:17.095 --> 02:20.014
Inspired, fearless, smart, beautiful?

02:20.098 --> 02:22.517
And I was gonna add to that,
uh, a handful?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.227
And that's what I love about her.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.436
Oh, no, you don't.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.272
-Yes, I do.
-[chortling] No, you don't.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.940
-I do.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.026
The guy who, uh, folds his socks
and T-shirts into neat little squares.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.571
-That has nothing to do with it.
-No, that is a guy who plans.

02:34.654 --> 02:39.409
That guy doesn't just run off and marry
some flaky dancer he barely knows.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.746
Unless he does, and that is...

02:43.830 --> 02:46.040
Then it's... You know, then it's great.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.293
Uh... And I'm sure it'll be great.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.003
Um...

02:50.128 --> 02:52.005
Pat. You okay?

02:52.088 --> 02:53.047
[Pat] Yeah, um...

02:53.756 --> 02:56.551
Ah, just... It took me by surprise,
but it's... it's all good. I mean...

02:56.634 --> 02:59.512
-All right, give me some love, man.
-Yes, sorry, that's what I meant to do.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.514
-Congratulations.
-Oh, man. Appreciate it.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.640
If you're happy, I'm happy.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.018
And you were my best man in my head.
You were there.

03:05.101 --> 03:05.935
-Okay.
-Okay?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.479
-[chuckles] All right.
-Let's get out there and see some lights.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.232
-Uh, I will be in here.
-You're gonna stay inside the yurt?

03:11.316 --> 03:15.403
Yeah, uh, I'm a lot more interested
in the numbers and not getting pneumonia,

03:15.486 --> 03:18.865
so just, uh, do a little sound check
while you're out there.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.575
-All right.
-In the freezing cold.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.576
Copy that.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.660
[chuckles]

03:27.165 --> 03:29.000
[Mark] <i>All right, sound check.</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:30.168
[Pat inhales sharply]

03:31.878 --> 03:33.504
<i>Bubble Boy, last chance.</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:36.216
I-- I'm sorry.
[stammers] I can't hear you.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.968
I'm... I'm too warm and comfortable
in here.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.720
[Mark] <i>All right, whatever.</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:45.516
[people chattering]

03:54.984 --> 03:56.402
All right, Pat. Talk to me.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.696
What kind of radiation
are we seeing up here?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.200
[Pat] <i>Um, elevated, but not unusual.</i>

04:03.451 --> 04:07.372
Uh, sonar's picking up an increased rate
of atmospheric turbulence.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.207
Well, I did just make an entrance.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.416
[Pat laughs]

04:11.501 --> 04:13.044
Government spying on us up here?

04:14.337 --> 04:15.964
Oh, no, nothing like that.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.174
We're just recording
atmospheric conditions

04:18.258 --> 04:20.301
before and after the comet passes.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.471
-Are you a scientist or an adventurer?
-Farmer.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.932
I've always wanted to see
the northern lights.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.268
Seems like this is the one to see.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.729
Yeah, well, they say
when the one comes along,

04:32.272 --> 04:33.273
you don't want to miss it.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.359
Can't wait.

04:36.985 --> 04:37.860
Yeah, me either.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.237
-See you, man.
-See you.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.536
[cell phone beeps]

04:47.829 --> 04:49.789
Hey, baby, it's me. Um...

04:50.873 --> 04:53.584
It's crazy up here.
I mean, it's so beautiful.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.378
I wish you could see it. [sniffs]

04:55.795 --> 04:57.630
Anyway, we got a lot of work to do,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.633
but I can't stop thinking
about when I'm getting home to you,

05:00.717 --> 05:02.260
because I miss that.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.679
[Pat] <i>Tell me you're not still talking</i>
<i>to the farmer.</i>

05:04.762 --> 05:06.889
Are you eavesdropping on my conversation?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.558
[Kerry] Oh, that's Pat's friend.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.892
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.602
Uh, your girl just waved at me.

05:11.686 --> 05:15.231
For once that doesn't threaten me,
married man.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.112
[man 1] Look at that. Wow.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.406
[man 2] Oh, man... Oh, man.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.745
[Mark] Pat? Pat, get your lame ass up here
because it's happening.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.751
[computer beeping]

05:37.420 --> 05:38.296
Hey, uh...

05:39.047 --> 05:41.716
Are you experiencing
a fluctuation in temperature out there?

05:41.799 --> 05:43.718
Yeah, I can feel your girl getting cold

05:43.801 --> 05:45.970
because you're hiding out
in a heated yurt.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.389
No, Mark, there's...
there's something... uh...

05:49.640 --> 05:50.892
[woman] Whoa.

05:54.020 --> 05:54.937
[computer beeps]

05:55.021 --> 05:55.855
Wow.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.190
[laughs]

05:57.273 --> 05:58.566
-[computer beeping]
-Mark?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.570
What's going on out there? Mark?

06:03.029 --> 06:06.199
[staticky] <i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>The radiation level's off the charts.</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:12.205
<i>Mark!</i>

06:12.705 --> 06:14.165
<i>...hear me? What's going on?</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:15.708
<i>Mark!</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:18.795
[exhales]

06:20.630 --> 06:21.672
[laughs]

06:22.590 --> 06:24.133
This is amazing.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.635
Baby, where are you?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.804
[Pat] <i>Mark? Mark?</i>

06:32.892 --> 06:34.519
[voices whispering indistinctly]

06:39.732 --> 06:42.527
<i>Hey, baby. Listen, we just got here</i>
<i>and it is amazing.</i>

06:42.610 --> 06:45.613
<i>I mean, it's so beautiful out here.</i>
<i>I wish you were here with me.</i>

06:45.696 --> 06:47.907
[inhales] <i>Okay, so we got</i>
<i>a lot of work to do,</i>

06:47.990 --> 06:50.868
<i>but I can't stop thinking</i>
<i>about when I'm getting home to you,</i>

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
<i>because I miss that.</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:54.539
[Pat] <i>Tell me you're not still talking</i>
<i>to the farmer.</i>

06:54.622 --> 06:56.791
[Mark] <i>Are you eavesdropping</i>
<i>on my conversation?</i>

06:56.874 --> 06:58.084
[cabinet opens]

07:29.991 --> 07:32.285
-Mom!
-Breakfast before Cheez Doodles.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.620
Those are for Pinchy.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.414
Really?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.710
Is that what's in the shaker, Pinchy?

07:41.377 --> 07:42.628
Cheez Doodles?

07:44.422 --> 07:47.884
Pinchy and I are gonna give you
one chance to take back that lie,

07:47.967 --> 07:50.344
-otherwise, we're grounding you.
-My party's today!

07:50.428 --> 07:52.847
-Five, four...
-I'm trying to finish my homework.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.265
...three, two...

07:54.849 --> 07:55.683
I'm sorry!

07:56.225 --> 07:58.895
I'm sorry, Pinchy.
You didn't deserve that.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.230
Come on, I'll make you breakfast.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.152
Did you tell everybody
to bring their skateboards to the party?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.154
Uh...

08:08.946 --> 08:11.824
Well, Chris and Steffi
aren't gonna make it, buddy.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.742
Or Jonathan.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.743
What?

08:13.993 --> 08:17.246
They, um... they have stuff
that they do on Saturdays, you know?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.998
And, uh, since when are you guys friends?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.251
I told Andre they were coming!
You have to call them back!

08:22.335 --> 08:24.837
Yeah, well, they're not gonna make it,
but you know who is coming?

08:24.921 --> 08:25.755
Esperanza's coming.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.174
Oh, why?

08:28.966 --> 08:30.092
Because she's your friend.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.595
She's not my friend. She's a girl.

08:33.054 --> 08:33.971
Steffi's a girl.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.139
Hm?

08:35.973 --> 08:38.351
Hey, I got you your favorite cake.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.061
[squeals]

08:40.144 --> 08:43.147
-Chocolate fudge volcano from Benny's?
-Yes, yes!

08:43.231 --> 08:45.691
-I'm picking it up on the way there.
-Okay.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.653
Yes! We're gonna have the best time today.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.446
You're gonna get to see
all your old friends.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.781
It's gonna be great. Hey.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.908
Next time, levitate a banana.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.752
[cell phone rings
to <i>Stanger Things </i>theme]

09:05.461 --> 09:07.922
If you're trying to return a magical crab,
I cannot help you.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.176
Are you coming to Dion's birthday party?
Because nobody else is.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.805
<i>Kat is on call, and my mom has a bad back</i>
<i>and can't travel,</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:17.598
<i>so my father won't travel without her.</i>

09:17.682 --> 09:19.141
<i>Mark's parents are in Germany, so...</i>

09:19.642 --> 09:22.520
Everyone is sending gifts,
but no one's actually coming.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.021
I will be there.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.483
Okay, it's at 3:00 p.m.
at Tasha Patel's house.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.486
I have the invitation.
I'm also on Tasha's side of town.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.364
-Do you need me to bring anything?
<i>-No, she has everything taken care of.</i>

09:33.447 --> 09:36.117
<i>She wasn't even actually planning</i>
<i>on having a party with us.</i>

09:36.200 --> 09:38.828
<i>Dion's had so many changes,</i>
<i>I just wanted something to stay the same.</i>

09:39.620 --> 09:40.454
Yeah, totally.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.623
That sounds, uh, good.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.541
Um...

09:45.126 --> 09:49.046
I... gotta go,
but, uh, I'll see you at the party.

09:49.130 --> 09:49.964
Okay.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.883
[inhales deeply]

09:53.342 --> 09:55.511
[cell phone rings]

09:56.512 --> 09:58.639
-I thought you said you had to go.
-Are you throwing up?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.975
-No, why?
-Then get in here.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.644
Season tickets go on sale today,
and I am alone.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.646
<i>-Stomach bug got half the staff.</i>
-Okay, um...

10:05.730 --> 10:08.566
Well, I can't today
because it's my son's birthday party.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.278
Don't give me drama.
I need you, and you need this job, right?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.821
Yeah, well, can't someone else do it?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.782
Yes, and I'm calling them, too,
but you're the first one to pick up.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.869
People are getting fired today,
let me tell you that.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.537
Okay, um...

10:22.580 --> 10:24.123
You know, the party is at 3:00,

10:24.206 --> 10:27.084
so if I leave
by no later than 2:00, then--

10:27.168 --> 10:29.503
Why are you doing math? Get here.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.674
[sighs]

[knocking]

10:47.146 --> 10:49.440
-Hi, Tessa. How's it going?
-Fine.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.985
I know this is really out of the blue, um,
but what are you doing today?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.988
Because I just got called into work
and it's my son's birthday party.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.948
You want me to throw him a birthday party?

10:58.032 --> 11:01.952
I was hoping that you could drive him.
It's at 3:00, in Ansley Park.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.871
-I gotta get dressed up?
-It's a kids' party.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.082
-In Ansley Park.
-You can wear whatever you want.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.084
And I will be done at work by 2:00,

11:08.167 --> 11:10.002
I will pick up the cake,
and meet you there.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.464
-All right.
-Really? 'Cause you barely know me.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.299
Girl, I know you. I got you.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.093
Thank you.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.387
Praise Jesus.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.033
[Pat clears throat]

11:45.246 --> 11:47.248
Do you have any idea
why the power went out?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.749
Hmm. Um...

11:48.833 --> 11:49.792
No, no.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.503
[stammers] Uh, Dion and I
were just talking about...

11:52.920 --> 11:54.046
[chuckles] you know...

11:54.964 --> 11:57.341
where we wanted to go for lunch,
and then, um...

11:57.883 --> 12:00.302
suddenly, boom, we were in total darkness.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.055
-Where'd you go?
-For lunch?

12:03.472 --> 12:04.765
[chuckles] During the blackout.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.393
When the lights came back on,
you were gone.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.936
[Pat] Yes. We, uh...

12:09.019 --> 12:10.604
[stammers] We just left.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.982
It was pitch black in there,

12:13.607 --> 12:17.820
and, uh, you had already given Dion
the royal tour, so...

12:18.738 --> 12:20.781
we just, uh... we made our way
to the front and the...

12:20.865 --> 12:22.867
the, uh, guards let us out.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.826
[inhales]

12:23.909 --> 12:26.579
-L5 was vandalized.
-What?

12:26.662 --> 12:28.956
Not long after
you were standing outside that door.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.709
Did you see anything unusual
while you were there?

12:32.209 --> 12:34.628
Not a thing.
I mean, I could check with Dion.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.672
Because I'm gonna see him,

12:36.756 --> 12:37.590
uh, actually...

12:37.673 --> 12:39.175
Oh, uh, right now.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.634
[chuckles] So, yeah.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.054
He's having a... a birthday party thing
with Tasha Patel's kid.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.265
Ah, I didn't realize
that was for Dion, too.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.183
Mm-hmm.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.226
You up on all the kid's parties?
[chuckles]

12:49.310 --> 12:51.270
-Not much gets past me.
-[Pat chuckles]

12:51.353 --> 12:52.229
Yeah.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.731
Well, um...

12:53.814 --> 12:55.983
I should probably get on the road,

12:56.442 --> 13:00.446
but, um, I'll let you know if...
if Dion remembers anything,

13:00.529 --> 13:03.491
you know, weird from... from yesterday.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.326
-That'd be great.
-Uh, yeah.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.452
Yep.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.370
[knocking]

13:10.790 --> 13:12.416
Thank you so much for doing this.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.126
Um, so, Dion is in his room,

13:14.210 --> 13:18.214
and he's really mad at me
for going to work on his birthday.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.883
Also, there's a girl from his class
that's gonna be riding with you.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.928
Her name is Esperanza,
and her dad will be dropping her off.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.305
-Do not let him be mean to her, okay?
-Okay.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.890
-Thank you.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.113
Have you been working on your legs?
Because you... you... you got up there.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.115
[laughs] Yeah, I caught some air.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.408
Mm-hmm. I'm impressed.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.368

15:52.868 --> 15:55.829
No, but seriously, baby,
you were... you were fantastic.

Thank you.

15:57.122 --> 15:57.998
Yeah.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.963
Yeah, it's a good one to quit on.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.048
Come on.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.883
What are you saying? You don't quit.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.135
Not forever, but...

16:13.389 --> 16:14.223
What's wrong?

16:14.765 --> 16:15.683
What's going on?

16:20.104 --> 16:20.938
Um...

16:22.815 --> 16:23.649
I'm...

16:26.568 --> 16:27.486
I'm pregnant.

16:29.071 --> 16:29.905

You're not afraid or...

16:50.551 --> 16:51.385
Afraid of what?

16:51.802 --> 16:52.761
You're not happy?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.683
I'm... very happy. [laughs]

16:58.225 --> 16:59.184
Then we got this.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.520
-Yeah.
-We got this.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.479
[laughs]

17:03.981 --> 17:05.274
I mean, I can take a year off,

17:05.816 --> 17:07.317
and the company would have me back,

17:07.401 --> 17:10.529
and then, I... I could figure out
childcare, and...

17:10.612 --> 17:12.531
Hey, I'm hearing a lot of I's.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.116

to take you off track from work.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.456
All right, look. I don't want
to lose track of my kid's life.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.543
My father wasn't around a lot
when I was growing up.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.421
He was always on deployment,
and you know that.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.007
Birthdays, football games.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.635
It was like he was never really there.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.433
Yeah, but that's not going to be me.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.520
I'll come off the road
and focus more on research.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.648
But if you'll allow it,
we're gonna have this baby.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.193
You and me.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.236
And we're gonna do this together.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.155
Okay, I'm gonna hold you to it.

Hey, Tessa, it's Nicole.

Look, I'm really glad I caught you,
because Esperanza's dad just texted me

18:47.543 --> 18:51.255
that he thinks it would be easier
with her wheelchair if you drove his van.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.297
Is that okay?

18:53.257 --> 18:56.218
Okay, good, 'cause he's on his way now.
Um...

18:56.885 --> 18:57.719

18:58.804 --> 19:01.390
Of course. Okay, see you. Bye.

Let's go. The party's in the backyard.

-Hey, hey, don't just run off.
-Can I go with them? Please.

19:31.420 --> 19:35.257
-Okay, go on. Might take me a minute.
-You guys go. I'll meet you back there.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.303
I found out about these cheat codes
on a gaming site

19:39.386 --> 19:41.180
that tells you how to stockpile diamonds.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.141
-Oh, you're talking about Reptile Repo?
-Yeah.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.059
[Andre] We don't play that anymore.

19:46.143 --> 19:46.977
Why not?

19:47.060 --> 19:48.353
Because it's stupid.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.648
Big dumb dinosaur eating diamonds.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.359
I know, right?
That's why I stopped playing it, too.

-What are you guys talking about?

19:59.489 --> 20:02.618
-Reptile Repo.
-Dion loves Reptile Repo.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.785
He got this idea.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.872
He found these cheat codes online
so he can stockpile diamonds.

Don't listen to her.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.432
She's in my class.
My mom made me bring her.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.309
Come on, the only reason I'm late

21:50.392 --> 21:52.519
was because Thomas was late
'cause he's a selfish prick,

21:52.602 --> 21:54.855
and I paid a lot of money
for that cake, okay?

-No.
-Now he's lying. [laughs]

27:31.858 --> 27:34.778
Hey, that's my best friend
you're talking about.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.030
He said he only brought you
'cause his mom made him.

-Andre.

You're not. I don't have a best friend.

your big mouth?!

28:31.376 --> 28:32.961
Why can't you keep a secret?!

You have powers. I've always known that.

-Yes.

30:04.010 --> 30:04.844
But how?

Why didn't you tell me?

Uh, no, I don't think so.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.481
Hmm.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.691
Why didn't you say anything?

30:20.068 --> 30:22.987
I figured you would tell me
when you wanted to, or not.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.280
Does anyone else know?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.866
You knocked Jonathan down
without touching him,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.410

This is for me to figure out.

you had abilities?

after going up to Iceland.

Nowhere.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.533
It's Dion's birthday today.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.077
You should be here.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.833
This wasn't the plan for us, Mark.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.336
We were supposed to do this together.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.678
Why did you do this to us? Just...

37:03.095 --> 37:06.974
secret lives, secret trips. You...

37:08.309 --> 37:11.229
You lied to me
about what you were doing in New Orleans.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.731
[stammers] And... don't tell me...

37:15.066 --> 37:16.984
it was so you were protecting me.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.404
I don't want protection.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.741
I want my husband.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.077
I want my kid's father.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.537
[Mark] <i>Yeah, that... that sounds great.</i>

37:30.998 --> 37:31.999
<i>How's Dion doing?</i>

37:32.375 --> 37:33.501
<i>I miss my little man.</i>

37:37.296 --> 37:39.548
Dion's great. He's the best kid ever.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.843
<i>I'm telling you, Nicole, that kid...</i>

37:43.636 --> 37:44.720
<i>is something special.</i>

37:45.012 --> 37:46.722
<i>He's gonna rule the world one day.</i>

37:47.807 --> 37:49.225
Do you remember that time...

37:50.810 --> 37:52.812
I thought you were gonna miss
Dion's birthday party?

37:52.895 --> 37:55.356
And then I turned around,
and there you were.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.407
I just keep wishing
that you would do that again.

38:07.326 --> 38:10.037

39:18.647 --> 39:19.482
What is it?

39:19.565 --> 39:20.441
Lightning.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.947
Okay, well, the lightning stopped.
Go back to bed.
