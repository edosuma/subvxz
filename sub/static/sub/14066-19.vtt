00:00.788 --> 00:02.460
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”…</i>

00:02.500 --> 00:04.204
All set for your testimony, Renée?

00:04.244 --> 00:06.852
I'm nervous. I'm
not as funny when I'm nervous.

00:06.892 --> 00:09.900
–She's very odd, Jerry.
–I lost my cherry.

00:10.716 --> 00:11.515
It was with Dana?

00:11.555 --> 00:12.876
Of course it was with Dana.
She's my girlfriend.

00:12.916 --> 00:14.755
–Jerry's girlfriend.
–What about her?

00:14.795 --> 00:16.516
I didn't entirely give up
the brothel business.

00:16.556 --> 00:17.892
I'm not gonna date a call girl.

00:17.932 --> 00:21.204
When I tell you I love you,
that isn't a lie.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.507
Please leave.

00:22.803 --> 00:25.791
Denny, if you were president, seriously,
you would nuke iraq and iran?

00:25.831 --> 00:26.953
Before breakfast.

00:27.032 --> 00:28.431
–Then what, North Korea?
–Okay.

00:28.471 --> 00:29.655
–Pakistan?
–Why not?

00:29.695 --> 00:31.741
–Afghanistan?
–If there's time.

00:37.893 --> 00:38.685
Tap dancing?

00:39.436 --> 00:41.109
I used it before
to battle stage fright

00:41.149 --> 00:42.885
when I first went into litigation.

00:42.925 --> 00:45.684
But it's also effective
for stress therapy.

00:45.724 --> 00:48.628
A trained therapist
actually suggested this?

00:49.148 --> 00:50.204
Is it too weird?

00:50.235 --> 00:51.796
Well, yes, Jerry.

00:52.276 --> 00:54.707
The hopping,
the wooden cigarette, the ticks,

00:54.747 --> 00:58.047
all of this I understand
and even appreciate, but…

01:00.675 --> 01:02.827
Dana. Hello. Welcome. Not.

01:03.796 --> 01:05.450
Hello, Jerry, Katie.

01:05.924 --> 01:06.812
Dana.

01:07.572 --> 01:08.548
Listen, uh…

01:10.859 --> 01:11.987
How do I say this?

01:12.027 --> 01:13.443
There's nothing to say, Dana.

01:13.483 --> 01:14.755
I made my position clear.

01:14.795 --> 01:15.719
I am finished.

01:15.915 --> 01:17.220
Read my… lips!

01:18.603 --> 01:19.659
Hello, Lorraine.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.319
You were my next stop.

01:21.843 --> 01:23.700
I'm not here to ask you
to take me back, Jerry,

01:23.740 --> 01:25.390
as much as I'd like that.

01:25.612 --> 01:27.328
I was arrested last night.

01:28.732 --> 01:29.920
One of my clients…

01:30.564 --> 01:31.884
One of your clients…

01:32.331 --> 01:36.555
Is an undercover agent working for
the Boston police department.

01:36.619 --> 01:38.665
I'm in a little bit of trouble.

01:39.459 --> 01:41.373
I'm here in need of a lawyer.

01:41.676 --> 01:42.868
She's a call girl?

01:43.260 --> 01:44.316
Can you believe it?

01:44.356 --> 01:45.988
First Lorraine, then this girl…

01:46.028 --> 01:47.292
hookers wherever you look.

01:47.332 --> 01:49.171
And have you seen this girl Dana?

01:49.211 --> 01:50.875
My god. She's so beautiful.

01:50.915 --> 01:53.619
And to think, she's only
a credit card away.

01:53.659 --> 01:54.451
Denny.

01:55.523 --> 01:57.395
Well, well, well.

01:58.171 --> 01:59.683
Finally come to pay your bet.

01:59.723 --> 02:00.787
How are you, Denny?

02:00.827 --> 02:02.420
$10,000 richer, I hope.

02:02.796 --> 02:04.335
Alan Shore, Paul Cruickshank.

02:04.375 --> 02:07.935
I beat his ass in golf for 5 grand,
then kicked what was left of it

02:07.975 --> 02:09.743
in the courtroom for another 5,000.

02:09.782 --> 02:12.439
The bet was, you were supposed
to come crawling in with your money.

02:12.479 --> 02:14.723
I'm not here about the bet, Denny.

02:15.128 --> 02:16.184
What is it then?

02:17.112 --> 02:19.128
It's extremely confidential.

02:20.456 --> 02:21.380
We're married.

02:22.199 --> 02:25.343
May I speak to you
in private, please?

02:33.648 --> 02:35.775
I'm assuming your office isn't bugged.

02:35.815 --> 02:37.729
It might be. Why do you care?

02:37.943 --> 02:42.784
Once I tell you why I'm here,
you'll realize this visit pains me

02:43.360 --> 02:45.076
far more than it does you.

02:45.111 --> 02:46.959
Let's get to that part then.

02:47.247 --> 02:50.648
You know I'm on the republican
national committee.

02:51.912 --> 02:55.464
What do you think,
honestly, of John McCain?

02:56.528 --> 02:59.392
Yes, that perception
appears to be shared.

02:59.784 --> 03:04.039
Next question… do you know
how W. got to be president?

03:04.399 --> 03:05.389
His SAT scores?

03:05.615 --> 03:08.535
We picked him, not because
of his intelligence…

03:08.575 --> 03:09.080
Gee.

03:09.399 --> 03:10.912
…or that he was a great speaker…

03:10.952 --> 03:11.471
No?

03:11.856 --> 03:13.223
…but because he tracks.

03:13.263 --> 03:14.319
He was a cowboy.

03:14.376 --> 03:17.408
He was somebody we could sell
to the american public.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.792
John McCain…

03:19.112 --> 03:19.583
isn't.

03:19.872 --> 03:20.911
Get to the punch line, Paul.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.667
I'm not feeling your pain.

03:22.879 --> 03:28.719
Because I have a relationship with you,
I've been asked to ask you…

03:31.079 --> 03:34.064
how would you feel about
running for president?

03:34.104 --> 03:35.754
There. I've done my duty.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.711
Just say no. I'll be gone.

03:39.439 --> 03:40.099
President?

03:41.159 --> 03:42.375
Of the United States?

03:42.415 --> 03:44.639
I can tell them you passed then?

03:45.111 --> 03:45.904
Denny Crane…

03:48.904 --> 03:50.158
Commander in Chief.

03:54.391 --> 03:55.256
I like it.

04:27.149 --> 04:30.518
–Don't be ridiculous.
–They're considering me and ten others.

04:30.558 --> 04:32.589
Evidently, my appearance
on the Larry King show

04:32.629 --> 04:34.740
went through the roof.
The public loves me, as expected.

04:34.780 --> 04:35.176
Denny…

04:35.388 --> 04:37.893
I'm not supposed to be telling
you anything, by the way.

04:37.933 --> 04:38.972
You know nothing.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.597
Do they know you have mad cow?

04:40.637 --> 04:42.188
They're looking for
the next Ronald Reagan,

04:42.228 --> 04:43.972
and he had it at the very end.

04:44.012 --> 04:45.853
Ronald Reagan didn't have
a hooker fetish.

04:45.893 --> 04:47.564
Please. I'm an emperor.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.897
Denny, no offense, but this is
beyond preposterous, beyond.

04:50.937 --> 04:55.296
Why? Bigger nut jobs
have been floated in the past…

04:55.632 --> 04:59.632
Lee Iacocca, Donald Trump,
Jesse Ventura. Why not me?

04:59.945 --> 05:02.585
Denny, you don't think
before you speak.

05:02.753 --> 05:04.585
You barely speak
the english language.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.273
You always have to get your way.

05:06.313 --> 05:08.041
You'd never get along
with other countries.

05:08.081 --> 05:11.448
For god sake, what would possess
the republican party…

05:11.488 --> 05:12.412
Heir apparent.

05:14.632 --> 05:15.536
This must be a joke.

05:15.576 --> 05:18.481
I'm being vetted by six committee
members this afternoon.

05:18.521 --> 05:19.649
I pass that test…

05:23.226 --> 05:23.952
Top secret.

05:42.498 --> 05:43.090
Hello.

05:44.755 --> 05:45.643
Hel-hello.

05:47.538 --> 05:50.026
Um… M-may I help you?

05:50.411 --> 05:51.180
You may.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.886
My name is Renee Winger.

05:52.926 --> 05:54.542
I was denied employment
by a company

05:54.582 --> 05:57.502
guilty of pervasive
and systemic gender bias.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.846
Might I count on you
to be my attorney?

05:59.886 --> 06:03.399
May I ask, what company
are you looking to sue?

06:03.767 --> 06:04.823
The Archdiocese.

06:07.559 --> 06:09.275
The Archdiocese of Boston?

06:09.846 --> 06:10.607
Yes.

06:10.902 --> 06:12.158
I seek to be a priest.

06:12.198 --> 06:13.254
Don't we all?

06:16.767 --> 06:17.823
You are a woman.

06:20.902 --> 06:21.958
Okay, thank you.

06:22.631 --> 06:23.753
Now will be fine.

06:26.422 --> 06:27.446
No arraignment yet.

06:27.486 --> 06:28.630
The DA wants to meet.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.142
Which means they're willing
to make a deal.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.102
Dana, I don't think
we can represent you.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.366
They'll most likely ask you
to flip your employer,

06:34.406 --> 06:35.727
and that would be Lorraine.

06:35.767 --> 06:36.837
I don't plan to flip anybody.

06:36.877 --> 06:39.756
I told Lorraine I'd preserve
her confidence. I keep my word.

06:39.796 --> 06:41.940
Spare us the
self-righteousness, Dana.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.488
You kept from me
you were a call girl.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.023
Look, folks, come on.

06:46.036 --> 06:49.652
They got us here dead to rights,
flat as a pancake, done, finis,

06:49.692 --> 06:51.078
sacre bleu, kaputski.

06:51.372 --> 06:54.936
Jerry, we agreed we'd leave out
the foreign languages.

06:55.644 --> 06:58.086
May I have a word
with Jerry, please?

07:06.773 --> 07:09.611
I don't expect you
to be able to reconcile…

07:09.860 --> 07:12.908
how a woman can have
sexual relations with one man

07:12.948 --> 07:15.992
while being committed to
and completely in love

07:16.032 --> 07:17.220
with another, but—

07:17.345 --> 07:18.321
I really don't want to go there.

07:18.361 --> 07:21.265
I thank you in advance
for your cooperation.

07:22.257 --> 07:24.865
Could we maybe go to dinner
and just talk?

07:24.905 --> 07:26.225
I'm seeing somebody.

07:27.344 --> 07:27.721
Who?

07:28.976 --> 07:31.112
An inflatable doll, if you must know.

07:31.152 --> 07:31.548
Patty?

07:31.944 --> 07:33.528
Patty wasn't inflatable.

07:33.672 --> 07:36.184
This is just a cheap,
transitional thing,

07:36.224 --> 07:37.610
not that you weren't.

07:37.992 --> 07:39.708
Give me a break, would ya?

07:54.904 --> 07:58.600
Let me acknowledge from the outset,
this is a long shot.

07:58.721 --> 07:59.209
Okay.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.657
For whatever reason,
your public appearances,

08:01.697 --> 08:04.985
most recently on Larry King,
have been very winning

08:05.025 --> 08:05.949
with our base.

08:06.104 --> 08:08.304
You also have a bit of
a wild west profile

08:08.344 --> 08:09.466
that John McCain…

08:09.864 --> 08:11.844
doesn't, but there are issues.

08:11.937 --> 08:14.017
You recently appeared
before the supreme court

08:14.057 --> 08:15.787
opposing the death penalty.

08:15.827 --> 08:16.947
Hired gun, just a case.

08:16.987 --> 08:18.874
I am for the death penalty.

08:19.187 --> 08:21.274
Always have been, always will be.

08:21.314 --> 08:23.430
I'd like to play
a political Rorschach test,

08:23.470 --> 08:25.384
a, uh, word association game.

08:25.518 --> 08:25.926
Shoot.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.207
I'll throw out a word.

08:27.247 --> 08:28.779
You say the first word
that pops into your head.

08:28.819 --> 08:29.771
–Shoot.
–Homosexual.

08:29.811 --> 08:30.827
–Shoot.
–Abortion.

08:30.867 --> 08:31.955
–Murder.
–The war.

08:31.995 --> 08:33.381
–Economy.
–Democrats.

08:33.606 --> 08:35.388
–John McCain.
–Immigration.

08:35.462 --> 08:36.650
–No mas.
–Hillary.

08:36.743 --> 08:37.903
Pull my finger.

08:38.647 --> 08:42.491
That was very interesting. Can
we turn to your personal life?

08:42.530 --> 08:43.019
Please.

08:43.443 --> 08:46.188
Our background check reveals
you enjoy spending time

08:46.228 --> 08:47.267
with prostitutes.

08:47.307 --> 08:48.099
Who doesn't?

08:48.427 --> 08:50.077
I like sex. I like women.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.419
I'll hump anything in a dress.

08:51.459 --> 08:53.388
I'll even get down on the floor
with you right now

08:53.428 --> 08:54.740
if they'll turn off the lights.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.859
But know this, the american public
will find it refreshing

08:57.899 --> 08:59.539
to finally get
a republican candidate

08:59.579 --> 09:03.737
who's not a moralistic, sexually
repressed, crusading hypocrite

09:03.845 --> 09:06.395
who cruises airport mens' rooms
late at night.

09:06.435 --> 09:09.067
Denny Crane rides
high in the saddle.

09:09.339 --> 09:10.595
I'll go into office
with my boots on,

09:10.635 --> 09:12.351
I'll die with my boots on.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.051
Next?

09:13.531 --> 09:14.351
Alan Shore.

09:14.703 --> 09:15.392
What about him?

09:15.432 --> 09:17.940
He expresses many
anti-american views.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.937
Which I disagree with
most of the time,

09:19.977 --> 09:23.041
but I won't throw him
under the bus to be president.

09:23.081 --> 09:24.269
What else you got?

09:24.281 --> 09:25.945
We're prepared to
go forward this year

09:25.985 --> 09:27.865
without the blessing
of the christian right,

09:27.905 --> 09:30.818
but we cannot and will not
abandon the values

09:30.858 --> 09:34.158
of our most valuable
and precious republican base.

09:34.161 --> 09:36.297
I speak, of course,
of the NRA.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.117
Bring it on.

10:00.796 --> 10:04.125
We have taken many ridiculous cases,
but suing a church…

10:04.165 --> 10:06.079
That's guilty of gender bias.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.892
What, are you saying
we should have a woman pope?

10:07.932 --> 10:10.100
There's evidence of
a female pope called Joan

10:10.140 --> 10:11.316
around the 9th century.

10:11.356 --> 10:13.780
Records of her were destroyed
by subsequent popes.

10:13.820 --> 10:16.220
Carl, it's not
a ridiculous case.

10:16.580 --> 10:20.012
And since it could be perceived
as runaway feminism,

10:20.541 --> 10:23.882
I really, really think it's important
that we have a man at the table.

10:23.922 --> 10:24.866
No! No, no, no.

10:24.906 --> 10:26.688
It's the right thing to do.

10:26.706 --> 10:27.787
And you know what?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.915
I'll bet a reasonable judge
will agree.

10:29.955 --> 10:34.147
Of all the ridiculous,
sacrilegious, blasphemous acts

10:34.491 --> 10:36.207
of heresy I've ever heard.

10:36.275 --> 10:37.648
As for the unreasonable ones…

10:37.688 --> 10:40.920
You want me to order the Archdiocese
to ordain a woman?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.713
We are simply asking you to deny
their tax-exempt status

10:43.753 --> 10:45.865
if they continue to discriminate.

10:45.905 --> 10:49.271
Ms Schmidt, the first amendment
to our constitution

10:49.337 --> 10:51.410
has something in it called
the establishment clause.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.147
Yes, I've read it.

10:52.187 --> 10:54.050
Your honor, I would
refer you to the case

10:54.090 --> 10:57.114
against Bob Jones university,
where a religious institution

10:57.154 --> 10:59.571
does not allow
interracial dating or marriage,

10:59.611 --> 11:02.203
and so they were denied
their tax-exempt status.

11:02.243 --> 11:05.050
Bob Jones was sued
as a school, not a church.

11:05.090 --> 11:08.654
They were sued as a religious
educational institution.

11:08.715 --> 11:10.818
There are many religions
that restrict

11:10.858 --> 11:14.092
the priesthood, counsel…
Orthodox judaism, islam,

11:14.282 --> 11:16.460
mormonism, orthodox christianity.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.426
And if they do so solely on gender,

11:18.466 --> 11:20.138
they're committing
a civil rights violation.

11:20.178 --> 11:21.610
Well, have you got a witness?

11:21.650 --> 11:23.346
Yes, I do,
I'm so glad you asked.

11:23.386 --> 11:23.994
Renée.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.324
You're going to like her.

11:27.835 --> 11:28.891
God beckoned me.

11:37.411 --> 11:38.490
Hello.

11:38.986 --> 11:41.356
My name's Katie Lloyd.
This is Jerry Espenson.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.782
–Hi.
–Hello. Welcome.

11:43.253 --> 11:44.869
Well, thank you for coming in.

11:44.909 --> 11:46.661
I'm sure you can guess
what's on my mind.

11:46.701 --> 11:47.204
We can.

11:48.412 --> 11:49.212
Good.

11:49.892 --> 11:50.901
Here's the offer…

11:50.941 --> 11:53.765
She tells us who runs the ring,
agrees to give testimony against

11:53.805 --> 11:54.997
this individual or individuals,

11:55.037 --> 11:59.129
we'll dismiss the charges
and give her transactional immunity.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.108
I'd first need to see a copy
of the incident report

12:02.148 --> 12:04.077
together with a proffer
of your agent's testimony

12:04.117 --> 12:06.044
so we can know
what we're dealing with

12:06.084 --> 12:06.892
in the way of evidence.

12:06.932 --> 12:08.620
No problem. We'll get that
to you right away.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.320
Thank you.

12:12.693 --> 12:14.871
It doesn't strike me as airtight.

12:14.948 --> 12:16.005
The language is ambiguous.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.348
No sex actually transpired.

12:17.388 --> 12:17.982
Lorraine.

12:19.069 --> 12:20.932
I don't see how
I can recommend anything other

12:20.972 --> 12:22.612
than she accept this offer.

12:22.652 --> 12:24.349
Otherwise, she's looking at jail.

12:24.389 --> 12:26.369
And if she does take the deal…

12:26.949 --> 12:30.645
Well, it's not like I never
thought this day could come.

12:31.685 --> 12:32.609
May I ask why?

12:33.605 --> 12:37.036
You've established yourself
as a first-rate attorney.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.716
Why continue
with this brothel business?

12:39.932 --> 12:41.648
I did get out for a while.

12:41.837 --> 12:42.556
And?

12:44.652 --> 12:45.453
I missed it.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.981
What do you mean, “it's on”?

12:49.365 --> 12:50.751
I got past round one.

12:50.901 --> 12:52.287
And what's round two?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.981
We meet with a bunch of donors,
test the waters

12:55.021 --> 12:56.524
to see if we can raise money.

12:56.564 --> 12:57.620
Can you imagine?

12:57.676 --> 13:00.660
No. Denny, would you even
want to be president?

13:00.700 --> 13:04.000
Think of it, you and I
on the oval office balcony,

13:04.277 --> 13:07.397
scotch, cigars,
maybe even an intern.

13:07.701 --> 13:10.275
Denny, your balcony days
would be over.

13:10.564 --> 13:13.402
There'd be sniper assassins
to worry about.

13:13.669 --> 13:17.233
Oh, please. Look, I know
it's not really gonna happen.

13:17.340 --> 13:18.858
I'm not kidding myself.

13:21.557 --> 13:22.053
But?

13:22.573 --> 13:25.469
But just to be considered,
to be on the short list,

13:25.509 --> 13:28.124
even for a day, that's something
to tell your grandchildren.

13:28.164 --> 13:29.948
I may have a few, by the way.

13:29.988 --> 13:30.988
You should check on that.

13:31.028 --> 13:31.788
We are.

13:32.149 --> 13:33.892
We'd need to do a background
check on you as well.

13:33.932 --> 13:34.651
Me?

13:34.890 --> 13:35.808
You're his best friend.

13:35.848 --> 13:36.568
We'd need to vet all of his—

13:36.608 --> 13:39.993
If you've gotten this far,
you've already vetted me.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.419
Will you get serious?

13:41.505 --> 13:44.608
To think I could have
my finger on the button…

13:46.977 --> 13:48.297
My own nuclear bomb.

13:53.627 --> 13:56.379
You want to withdraw because
your advice would be to take the deal,

13:56.419 --> 13:58.906
and you don't want to act
against Lorraine's interests.

13:58.946 --> 13:59.936
Basically, yes.

13:59.954 --> 14:01.258
Well, I don't want the deal.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.802
You don't have to do this for me.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.114
I'm not doing it for you.

14:04.154 --> 14:06.258
When I made my choice
to go into this profession,

14:06.298 --> 14:07.816
I did so without shame.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.499
I reject the notion
that it's immoral,

14:09.539 --> 14:12.595
and I won't be judged for it,
especially by you.

14:12.635 --> 14:15.018
You'll be judged by the law,
Dana, which criminalizes—

14:15.058 --> 14:18.106
A law which is as unreasonable
as it is archaic,

14:18.146 --> 14:20.060
and I'd like to challenge it.

14:21.226 --> 14:22.546
You can't mean that.

14:22.722 --> 14:23.712
I do mean that.

14:24.235 --> 14:28.723
Is there a mechanism for challenging
the validity of the law itself?

14:28.923 --> 14:31.893
Well, our best bet would be
to get the matter

14:31.914 --> 14:35.162
certified to the Massachusetts
supreme judicial court and…

14:35.202 --> 14:36.618
That's what I want to do.

14:36.658 --> 14:39.430
We'll take our shot there
and then decide…

14:40.426 --> 14:43.299
Please stop looking at me
like I'm a sexual deviant.

14:43.339 --> 14:44.412
Could you do that, Jerry?

14:44.452 --> 14:45.947
But you are a sexual deviant, Dana.

14:45.987 --> 14:48.499
You engage in sexual conduct
for a fee.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.338
That's as deviant
as it is immoral.

14:50.378 --> 14:52.970
I do judge you, and I'll ask you
to stop looking at me

14:53.010 --> 14:55.122
for either approval or sympathy.

15:10.498 --> 15:13.953
We've stayed any formal arraignment
pending motion before the SJC.

15:13.993 --> 15:18.151
Should we lose, you can expect
to be formally charged tomorrow.

15:20.159 --> 15:21.655
I'd like you to argue it, Jerry.

15:21.695 --> 15:22.591
Me? Why?

15:22.887 --> 15:23.679
Please.

15:24.279 --> 15:25.087
Hello.

15:25.423 --> 15:25.863
Denny.

15:26.159 --> 15:26.687
Hello.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.595
Pick a card, any card.

15:29.071 --> 15:32.041
We could meet after work,
have a winespitzer.

15:36.495 --> 15:37.419
Had six wives.

15:38.239 --> 15:40.021
None of them understood me.

15:44.839 --> 15:46.351
Many of the church's doctrines

15:46.391 --> 15:48.575
have nothing to do
with divine law.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.575
For example?

15:50.135 --> 15:51.653
Well, celibacy for one.

15:51.902 --> 15:54.534
Priests were not required
to be celibate until 1139,

15:54.574 --> 15:56.359
before which they were allowed
to have families,

15:56.399 --> 15:57.591
usually quite large.

15:57.631 --> 16:01.866
Celibacy was a function of economic
pragmatism, not divine law.

16:02.327 --> 16:04.151
I would probably not be celibate.

16:04.191 --> 16:05.973
I am sexually rambunctious.

16:08.127 --> 16:11.889
And may I ask, is this something
that's important to you?

16:12.031 --> 16:15.481
Yes. When I was young,
people considered me off.

16:16.015 --> 16:17.731
I was shunned, ostracized.

16:18.303 --> 16:19.991
As you can see,
it's still very difficult

16:20.031 --> 16:21.367
for me to talk about it now.

16:21.407 --> 16:23.543
The catholic church
reached out to me.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.495
They were a source
of great comfort.

16:25.535 --> 16:28.046
I would like to extend
the tolerance and compassion

16:28.086 --> 16:29.790
to others that was
so greatly afforded to me

16:29.830 --> 16:30.902
in my time of…

16:33.895 --> 16:36.799
I apologize. I didn't mean
to get emotional.

16:47.038 --> 16:47.711
What are you doing?

16:47.751 --> 16:49.467
Here, take a look at this.

16:51.415 --> 16:53.395
If I did run, I couldn't lose.

16:54.799 --> 16:55.831
Look at her eyes.

16:55.871 --> 16:57.055
Mad cow, man.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.184
Oh, come on.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.011
What else could it be?

17:01.830 --> 17:02.622
Makes sense.

17:03.166 --> 17:04.406
I'm pretty sure Bill's got it.

17:04.446 --> 17:05.855
Could be post-traumatic stress.

17:05.895 --> 17:08.415
Remember the Whitewater
rafting trip with Kenneth Starr?

17:08.454 --> 17:10.663
And she took a lot
of sniper fire in Bosnia,

17:10.703 --> 17:12.967
bullets sailing over her head
as she ran for cover.

17:13.007 --> 17:14.734
Surprising Bill
in the oval office…

17:14.775 --> 17:16.271
That had to be
some shock and awe.

17:16.311 --> 17:18.154
Her problem with Bill is
she isn't pretty enough.

17:18.194 --> 17:20.503
She needs to be prettier, like him.

17:20.921 --> 17:22.416
You think he's pretty?

17:22.768 --> 17:24.601
What? What are you talking about?

17:24.641 --> 17:26.314
He used to be Whitney Houston.

17:26.354 --> 17:28.977
What about McCain? You'd
first have to get by him.

17:29.017 --> 17:32.176
Please. McCain is
patient zero, mad cow.

17:32.576 --> 17:34.866
He can't remember anybody
he's met before,

17:34.906 --> 17:36.328
so he calls everybody his friend.

17:36.368 --> 17:37.754
You know, my friends…

17:37.897 --> 17:38.921
Thank you all, my friends.

17:38.961 --> 17:39.801
My friends… my friends…

17:39.841 --> 17:40.567
My friends…

17:40.889 --> 17:41.537
That tonight, my friends…

17:41.577 --> 17:42.329
Well, my friends…

17:42.369 --> 17:43.359
So, my friends…

17:43.409 --> 17:44.402
So, my friends…

17:46.081 --> 17:48.989
They want me to take a physical
before I meet with the donors.

17:49.029 --> 17:49.689
I'm sorry?

17:49.693 --> 17:50.751
The, uh, search committee.

17:50.791 --> 17:53.111
They want me to take a physical
to make sure I'm healthy.

17:53.151 --> 17:58.353
Oh, please. I can kick Mccain's ass,
Obama too, Hillary I'm not sure of.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.282
So what, you have to go
to one of their doctors?

18:01.322 --> 18:02.785
On the QT at the Avalon.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.344
And that's where the meeting
with the donors is.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.090
How could they possibly
take it this far?

18:07.377 --> 18:08.895
I'm a wanted man, Alan.

18:10.025 --> 18:10.689
Wanted.

18:16.577 --> 18:18.227
You expect me to overturn

18:18.417 --> 18:20.649
the law against prostitution
in the Commonwealth?

18:20.689 --> 18:21.745
Yes, your honor.

18:21.776 --> 18:24.235
Or in the alternative,
schedule a hearing

18:24.275 --> 18:25.699
before the full
Supreme Judicial Court

18:25.739 --> 18:28.395
to determine whether the statute
is arbitrary, unreasonable,

18:28.435 --> 18:30.515
and therefore unconstitutional
on its ass.

18:30.555 --> 18:31.579
Face.

18:32.155 --> 18:34.570
Okay, why don't you start
by telling me

18:34.610 --> 18:36.062
why it's unreasonable?

18:36.410 --> 18:36.872
Gladly.

18:46.539 --> 18:48.684
It's estimated
that legalizing prostitution

18:48.724 --> 18:52.578
would decrease the rape rate
in this country by 25%.

18:52.933 --> 18:55.683
That alone should merit
the court's consideration.

18:55.723 --> 18:59.651
Moreover, criminalizing prostitution
doesn't make it go away.

18:59.691 --> 19:01.707
It just renders it
more dangerous.

19:01.747 --> 19:04.027
Why not regulate the profession?

19:04.491 --> 19:08.267
Employ and ensure safety measures
that would reduce the risk

19:08.307 --> 19:11.074
of AIDS, STDs.
We could also ensure that

19:11.403 --> 19:14.219
the women are less exploited,
be it with insurance benefits—

19:14.259 --> 19:16.820
I am offended by the idea that
this doesn't victimize women.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.908
–It's legal in Nevada…
–What isn't in Nevada?

19:18.948 --> 19:20.979
–…and Rhode Island, Canada…
–This is an issue for the legislature…

19:21.019 --> 19:22.659
–…many, many countries…
–…not the court.

19:22.699 --> 19:24.787
–…Argentina, Australia, England, Brazil…
–I don't care what other countries do.

19:24.827 --> 19:26.012
–…New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Ireland, Italy, Germany…
–We do not follow, we lead…

19:26.052 --> 19:27.284
–…Greece, Iceland, Mexico, Switzerland.
–…and we certainly do not conform

19:27.324 --> 19:30.162
our moral code to coincide…
–Let me finish!

19:30.664 --> 19:32.304
Who are you looking to protect?

19:32.344 --> 19:35.644
My investigators have seen
you with Ms Strickland.

19:36.314 --> 19:39.177
Hey, you want to go after me,
sweetheart? Take your shot.

19:39.217 --> 19:41.369
I will go after you
if you have broken the law.

19:41.409 --> 19:44.073
Your honor, this law
is about imposing a morality.

19:44.113 --> 19:45.585
What's more, it doesn't work.

19:45.625 --> 19:46.945
Prostitution exists.

19:47.056 --> 19:48.046
It always will.

19:48.376 --> 19:50.656
Driving it underground
makes it more dangerous.

19:50.696 --> 19:52.912
It establishes a base camp,
if you will,

19:52.952 --> 19:55.489
for organized crime,
for other criminal enterprises,

19:55.529 --> 19:57.617
including the child sex trade,
slave trafficking…

19:57.657 --> 19:58.809
He is talking in circles.

19:58.849 --> 20:02.479
How about we take this money
earmarked for prosecutions

20:02.657 --> 20:06.691
and dedicate it to AIDS
awareness, sex education?

20:07.003 --> 20:10.303
25% of american female teenagers
between 14 and 19

20:10.347 --> 20:12.063
now have some form of STD.

20:12.179 --> 20:16.171
Meanwhile, we see more and more
abstinence programs popping up,

20:16.211 --> 20:18.146
schools forbidden
to talk about condoms.

20:18.186 --> 20:19.484
That's what's criminal.

20:19.524 --> 20:20.898
And legalizing prostitution—

20:20.938 --> 20:24.172
Will end up with fewer
prostitutes in the morgue.

20:25.010 --> 20:28.970
And given that it's a multi‐
billion-dollar industry anyway,

20:29.595 --> 20:31.067
why not tax it?

20:31.491 --> 20:34.962
Why not use it to help build
the hospitals and schools

20:35.002 --> 20:37.538
that politicians promise to deliver,
but never get around to

20:37.578 --> 20:39.834
'cause many of them are too busy
hanging out with hookers?

20:39.874 --> 20:41.346
We could use that money, judge.

20:41.386 --> 20:42.376
We're in a war.

20:42.436 --> 20:43.554
We have a deficit.

20:43.594 --> 20:45.979
Billions of dollars…
why give it to criminals,

20:46.019 --> 20:48.725
when we can use it
to support our troops?

20:48.883 --> 20:50.203
Trump card! I said it.

20:50.243 --> 20:52.258
Support our troops. I win!

21:12.314 --> 21:12.994
Thank you.

21:13.789 --> 21:16.402
May I ask what you're doing here?

21:16.810 --> 21:17.932
Denny invited me.

21:18.522 --> 21:20.238
Don't worry. I won't tell.

21:20.426 --> 21:22.371
I'm very loyal to the party.

21:23.122 --> 21:25.713
Of course, one might question
your loyalty…

21:25.753 --> 21:28.987
offering Denny Crane
as a presidential candidate.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.154
You think it's my idea?

21:31.498 --> 21:34.250
My only hope is that these people
come to their senses.

21:34.290 --> 21:37.242
On the other hand,
John McSnore doesn't win

21:37.490 --> 21:39.008
the logic prize either.

21:39.050 --> 21:40.098
Where is Denny?

21:41.442 --> 21:43.818
I believe he's getting his physical.

21:44.505 --> 21:46.314
So you weren't told
to bring your records?

21:46.354 --> 21:48.674
Why don't you just take
my blood pressure,

21:48.714 --> 21:49.682
and let's get on with this?

21:49.722 --> 21:51.362
I took your blood pressure,
Mr Crane.

21:51.402 --> 21:53.052
That was not a polygraph.

21:53.082 --> 21:54.370
Now you'll need an EKG.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.108
What for?

21:55.364 --> 21:56.404
To check your heart.

21:56.444 --> 21:58.379
It's to make sure that you
don't keel over and die.

21:58.419 --> 22:00.463
Oh, judas priest.

22:01.084 --> 22:03.654
We certainly teach that
men and women are equal.

22:03.694 --> 22:04.260
But…

22:04.556 --> 22:07.364
But they have different roles
that are divinely bestowed.

22:07.404 --> 22:10.516
This is an authoritarian teaching
called complementarity.

22:10.556 --> 22:11.612
Complementarity?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.340
Yes. It's not sexism.

22:13.756 --> 22:15.796
We believe in the plan of god.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.476
Men and women complement each other,

22:18.516 --> 22:21.156
and there by occupy
different positions.

22:21.435 --> 22:22.689
Separate but equal?

22:22.916 --> 22:24.404
Spend a day with the nuns.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.444
You might conclude
they're a little more equal.

22:26.484 --> 22:27.900
That would be funny…

22:28.380 --> 22:29.700
if it wasn't sexist.

22:29.868 --> 22:33.148
Women can head state
and national and international

22:33.188 --> 22:34.491
catholic institutions.

22:34.531 --> 22:36.356
But when it comes
to being a priest…

22:36.396 --> 22:38.236
That role is reserved for men.

22:38.276 --> 22:39.956
You realize, your holiness,
that a majority of catholics

22:39.996 --> 22:43.296
in this country now favor women
in the priesthood?

22:43.484 --> 22:46.931
We don't modify doctrine
to comply with opinion polls.

22:46.971 --> 22:48.621
Oh, come on. Sure you do.

22:49.404 --> 22:52.628
The church once defended slavery
as willed by god…

22:52.668 --> 22:54.450
You modified that doctrine.

22:54.636 --> 22:56.828
Then there was the persecution
of witches,

22:56.868 --> 22:58.364
you know, with the big rocks…

22:58.404 --> 22:59.148
Torture.

22:59.564 --> 23:02.077
And let's not forget the crimes
of the inquisition.

23:02.117 --> 23:04.204
All of those were
catholic church doctrines

23:04.244 --> 23:06.619
adjusted according
to popular opinion.

23:06.659 --> 23:09.524
And let's not forget that you
once condemned homosexuality

23:09.564 --> 23:13.172
as an intrinsic and moral evil,
but… oh, wait.

23:13.523 --> 23:14.975
That one still stands.

23:16.932 --> 23:20.140
Your holiness, I have great respect
and well, appreciation

23:20.180 --> 23:21.788
for the catholic church.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.196
How could I not?

23:23.292 --> 23:24.363
After all, I'm a Jew.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.383
You made one of ours almighty.

23:28.764 --> 23:30.588
But this woman thing…

23:31.044 --> 23:33.740
The truth is, in many cities,
women are being

23:33.780 --> 23:35.629
secretly ordained by roman catholic,

23:35.669 --> 23:38.764
male bishops who believe it is
the right thing to do.

23:38.804 --> 23:41.988
Those bishops do so
at the risk of excommunication.

23:42.028 --> 23:43.678
Even the mere mention of—

23:43.700 --> 23:44.624
Wait a second.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.604
So one could have
a glorious catholic career,

23:46.644 --> 23:50.596
rise to the position of bishop,
yet, if you are to so much as whisper,

23:50.636 --> 23:54.860
“hey, maybe women should be ordained,”
you'd be excommunicated?

24:02.340 --> 24:03.330
It sounds like…

24:03.363 --> 24:06.861
somebody, somewhere,
has got something against women.

24:12.308 --> 24:13.760
I find you attractive.

24:20.908 --> 24:23.893
Why couldn't we do this
at a regular doctor's office?

24:23.933 --> 24:25.524
You're asking the wrong person.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.742
All I was told is, it's security,

24:27.796 --> 24:30.276
and we need to set up
separate facilities in here.

24:30.316 --> 24:32.980
Why you people have to be
so damn secretive is beyond me.

24:33.020 --> 24:33.668
In here.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.068
Surprise!

24:53.483 --> 24:55.156
Gotcha, Denny. Gotcha.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.196
Ladies and gentlemen…

24:57.700 --> 25:00.908
I give to you the next
president of the United States…

25:00.948 --> 25:02.548
Denny Crane!

25:12.396 --> 25:14.518
So… this is a joke?

25:16.724 --> 25:20.989
Mike Brady came up with
the idea, it just took on a life,

25:21.444 --> 25:24.972
and… and we figured,
why not make a party out of it?

25:27.140 --> 25:30.308
So I… I'm… I'm not really
running for president?

25:34.220 --> 25:36.464
May I have your attention,
please?

25:38.733 --> 25:42.316
I'm special agent John Sharpe of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

25:42.356 --> 25:44.387
I need you all
to get down on your knees

25:44.427 --> 25:47.076
and put your hands
on top of your heads, now.

25:47.116 --> 25:48.172
What's going on?

25:48.284 --> 25:49.274
Do it now, sir.

25:49.476 --> 25:51.812
This is a roomful of lawyers,
you know…

25:51.852 --> 25:53.476
Sir, I'm running this party now.

25:53.516 --> 25:56.516
You're all under arrest
for theft by false pretenses.

25:56.556 --> 25:56.972
What?

25:57.285 --> 26:01.260
We have been informed of a fund-
raising scheme for an individual

26:01.300 --> 26:03.939
fraudulently posing
as a presidential candidate.

26:03.979 --> 26:04.372
No.

26:04.732 --> 26:08.296
–No, no, no, no, no.
–Sir, down on your knees, please.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.497
Look, we're not really
asking for money.

26:11.537 --> 26:12.989
It's a practical joke.

26:13.194 --> 26:14.448
We're all in on it.

26:14.802 --> 26:16.130
I'm… I'm not in on it.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.058
A practical joke?

26:17.098 --> 26:18.220
Yes, on this man…

26:18.602 --> 26:19.450
Denny Crane.

26:19.906 --> 26:21.714
He was the one deceived.

26:22.010 --> 26:23.906
Nobody's actually
being solicited for money.

26:23.946 --> 26:25.019
No transaction…

26:25.332 --> 26:26.852
Is this true, sir?
Are they all in on it?

26:26.892 --> 26:30.918
I don't know. I can't believe
that Harry Beckett is in on it.

26:31.354 --> 26:34.784
And Sandra Cook? She hasn't got
a mean bone in her body.

26:34.824 --> 26:37.930
Mitch. You were
at all six of my weddings.

26:38.938 --> 26:39.866
All these people…

26:39.906 --> 26:41.820
They know me, we go way back…

26:41.962 --> 26:44.272
And they of all people
should know…

26:47.738 --> 26:49.718
That you can't get the master.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.490
You all have the right
to remain silent.

26:51.530 --> 26:53.965
You have all been had
by Mr Denny Crane.

26:54.005 --> 26:54.863
–What?
–What?

26:55.167 --> 26:55.720
Maestro.

26:59.479 --> 27:01.179
Amateurs, all of ya.

27:04.419 --> 27:05.937
You don't look so good.

27:07.067 --> 27:08.123
Start the party.

27:28.099 --> 27:28.468
Hey.

27:30.884 --> 27:31.544
What's up?

27:33.706 --> 27:34.387
We lost.

27:35.243 --> 27:36.955
Evidently, the judge
didn't go for the idea

27:36.995 --> 27:39.503
of using prostitution
to fund the war.

27:39.653 --> 27:40.841
So we go to trial.

27:40.861 --> 27:43.349
Your arraignment is scheduled
for tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

27:43.389 --> 27:45.422
And my chances of winning?

27:47.377 --> 27:48.037
Not great.

27:48.965 --> 27:52.727
Dana, you do have to consider
this deal they're offering.

27:55.002 --> 27:57.017
Can I talk to Jerry
for a minute?

27:57.057 --> 27:57.717
Certainly.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.078
I'm sorry.

28:06.369 --> 28:09.405
I spun a little out of control
in my argument.

28:09.882 --> 28:12.324
I didn't really expect
to win, Jerry.

28:14.241 --> 28:16.683
The reason, uh,
I even wanted to try,

28:16.977 --> 28:20.013
the reason I specifically
wanted you to argue…

28:20.802 --> 28:23.193
I read of the, uh,
the phenomenon

28:23.545 --> 28:26.049
where lawyers invariably
come to believe

28:26.089 --> 28:28.267
in the merits of their arguments.

28:29.273 --> 28:30.857
I wanted you to believe…

28:31.961 --> 28:33.545
that I'm not a criminal.

28:34.161 --> 28:37.395
I wanted you to be convinced
that I'm not amoral.

28:41.201 --> 28:44.369
Because I want desperately
to get back with you.

28:49.809 --> 28:51.261
Is that a possibility?

28:56.385 --> 28:56.930
No.

29:00.290 --> 29:00.682
Okay.

29:03.010 --> 29:04.873
Well, uh… I…

29:05.872 --> 29:08.928
I guess I'll, uh,
I'll see you in court then.

29:40.224 --> 29:42.415
Your honor, the plaintiff
is asking you

29:42.455 --> 29:46.613
to invalidate church law on the
grounds that it's unreasonable.

29:47.336 --> 29:49.320
This is religion, for god's sake.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.783
We don't hold religion
and faith up to standards

29:53.087 --> 29:54.359
of reasonableness.

29:54.687 --> 29:55.809
Why shouldn't we?

29:55.975 --> 29:59.560
Does it really make sense that
god got mad at the human race

29:59.600 --> 30:01.680
and drowned them all,
including children

30:01.720 --> 30:04.080
and all the animals
except two of each,

30:04.120 --> 30:05.968
which survived on a big boat?

30:06.008 --> 30:10.847
Do christians literally believe
the earth was made in seven days?

30:11.671 --> 30:13.915
Religion… Some of it is out there.

30:14.255 --> 30:19.080
But we all have the right
to believe in what we choose.

30:19.504 --> 30:22.199
That's the point
of the establishment clause.

30:22.239 --> 30:25.616
One of the many reasons
America came into being

30:26.000 --> 30:30.608
was so that we as a people
could be free to practice

30:30.943 --> 30:32.725
the religion of our choice.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.495
Now one doesn't have to love
the tenets of catholicism.

30:36.535 --> 30:40.279
Ms Winger is certainly free
to choose another faith.

30:40.880 --> 30:46.495
But paramount to the catholic
religion is a male priesthood.

30:47.448 --> 30:49.296
It's not just the catholics.

30:49.463 --> 30:52.527
Orthodox judaism segregates
men and women in the synagogue.

30:52.567 --> 30:55.416
Girls have to sit in the back
or the balcony.

30:55.456 --> 30:57.664
They also don't allow women
to be rabbis.

30:57.704 --> 30:58.984
Islam… forget about it.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.312
They don't even let women
show their faces.

31:01.352 --> 31:05.378
The ugly fact is that we're okay
with bigotry in this country

31:05.479 --> 31:07.657
as long as it's cloaked
in faith.

31:07.719 --> 31:10.072
And the prejudice
isn't limited to women.

31:10.112 --> 31:12.136
You think we'll ever eliminate
gay bashing

31:12.176 --> 31:13.816
while giving tax breaks
to institutions

31:13.856 --> 31:17.408
who declare that homosexuality
is a moral sin, an evil?

31:17.448 --> 31:19.968
Whether it's persecution of
the christians in ancient Rome

31:20.008 --> 31:21.991
or the holocaust
during World War II

31:22.031 --> 31:25.983
or Bosnia today, where we have
an ethnic genocide in progress,

31:26.023 --> 31:28.240
religion has a mean legacy.

31:28.639 --> 31:30.000
This isn't about Bosnia.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.096
Why would you have to travel
the globe to make a point,

31:33.136 --> 31:36.436
Mr Sack, if your argument
held water here at home?

31:36.456 --> 31:38.582
You want me to keep it local?
Fine with me.

31:38.622 --> 31:39.546
Pat Robertson.

31:39.878 --> 31:41.132
He's a popular guy.

31:41.342 --> 31:43.606
He referred to presbyterians
and episcopalians

31:43.646 --> 31:47.061
and methodists
as the spirit of antichrist.

31:47.597 --> 31:50.526
He's also rumored to have
blamed Katrina on the fact

31:50.566 --> 31:53.610
that Ellen Degeneres… a lesbian…
lived in New Orleans.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.673
Jerry Falwell said
that 9/11 happened

31:57.033 --> 31:59.871
because of god's wrath
against homosexuals.

32:03.161 --> 32:04.481
I'm a spiritual man.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.808
I go to temple. I pray.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.308
I believe in god.

32:09.370 --> 32:12.058
But we cannot deny that religion
is one place

32:12.098 --> 32:16.529
where we allow hate and oppression
and discrimination to fester

32:16.873 --> 32:19.889
as it seeks safe haven
in the constitution.

32:20.737 --> 32:23.714
The catholic church, by denying
the priesthood to women,

32:23.754 --> 32:26.290
is guilty of gender bias.

32:26.730 --> 32:27.720
Simple as that.

32:29.474 --> 32:30.464
It should stop.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.454
And there goes
my humanitas award.

32:46.466 --> 32:48.478
Jerry. She didn't show.

32:48.926 --> 32:49.586
Excuse me?

32:49.805 --> 32:52.869
Dana. She skipped arraignment.
There's a warrant out for her arrest.

32:52.909 --> 32:54.021
Did she say anything
about this to you?

32:54.061 --> 32:55.843
No. She just said good-bye.

32:56.125 --> 32:57.134
Well, she's…

33:02.325 --> 33:05.757
Dana Strickland seems to have
disappeared, Lorraine.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.805
Would you know anything that?

33:07.845 --> 33:08.173
No.

33:09.469 --> 33:12.677
Wouldn't have… facilitated her
fleeing the jurisdiction, by chance?

33:12.717 --> 33:15.621
That would make me
an accomplice to a crime.

33:29.797 --> 33:31.085
I simply have to know.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.633
Did you know
right from the beginning?

33:34.133 --> 33:36.047
You had me for about an hour.

33:36.662 --> 33:39.230
Your problem is,
I know Chris Andrews, insider.

33:39.270 --> 33:41.742
He and Dick Cheney
shoot lawyers together.

33:41.782 --> 33:44.620
One phone call,
I knew what you were up to.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.757
When are you gonna learn, Paul?

33:46.797 --> 33:47.787
You can't fool…

33:52.046 --> 33:52.838
Denny Crane.

33:53.862 --> 33:55.380
Did you bring my money?

33:58.054 --> 33:59.110
Thank you, Paul.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.537
And thank you for going to
the great lengths you did,

34:01.577 --> 34:05.471
along with all those other people,
to try and humiliate me.

34:05.569 --> 34:07.219
Really made me feel good.

34:10.074 --> 34:12.648
You know, Denny,
I didn't really intend

34:12.761 --> 34:15.137
for it to come off
as mean-spirited.

34:16.313 --> 34:16.976
As it did.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.157
See you, Paul.

34:29.681 --> 34:31.145
I'm a lucky man, huh?

34:33.705 --> 34:34.521
Denny…

34:36.179 --> 34:38.777
Practical jokes
are very complicated.

34:39.168 --> 34:43.562
Some of them are mean-spirited,
but typically, there is

34:43.873 --> 34:45.456
affection involved, too.

34:46.714 --> 34:48.321
They're not played on enemies.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.809
They're played on friends.

34:49.849 --> 34:51.367
With friends like that…

34:51.536 --> 34:55.945
You're a successful, powerful
man of whom many people

34:56.447 --> 34:57.834
are probably jealous.

34:59.095 --> 35:02.976
As strong as friendship is,
maybe it's no match for envy.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.135
I gotta keep reminding myself
what's important here.

35:08.488 --> 35:09.176
Which is?

35:10.312 --> 35:11.566
They didn't get me.

35:12.688 --> 35:13.640
I got them.

35:16.887 --> 35:18.712
Yes, you did.

35:21.311 --> 35:22.235
Ah, all right.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.182
I must confess, every time
I hear some feminist

35:26.264 --> 35:29.096
complaing about women's rights,
I mutter to myself,

35:29.136 --> 35:30.258
“oh, go to hell.”

35:31.032 --> 35:32.602
Last night, I had a dream…

35:32.642 --> 35:34.650
one that I've had before, mind you.

35:34.690 --> 35:36.210
I arrive at the pearly gates,

35:36.250 --> 35:37.702
I'm introduced to God.

35:38.538 --> 35:39.462
She's a woman.

35:39.970 --> 35:42.162
She stands there
with her arms folded,

35:42.202 --> 35:44.722
and she asks,
“and where did you stand

35:45.053 --> 35:47.099
on women's rights, your honor?”

35:47.361 --> 35:49.473
and then she says,
“go to hell.”

35:50.145 --> 35:53.525
Catholic people are tolerant
and intelligent,

35:53.850 --> 35:55.906
and I believe
they would be open to this.

35:55.946 --> 35:58.798
And I also agree that if the church
is going to discriminate,

35:58.838 --> 36:02.398
the government should at least
not incentivize their bigotry

36:02.438 --> 36:03.494
with tax breaks.

36:04.173 --> 36:07.734
If we the people are sincere
about eliminating discrimination

36:07.774 --> 36:10.990
in this country,
we can't tolerate it anywhere,

36:12.070 --> 36:14.414
even if it comes
in religious form.

36:15.350 --> 36:17.918
Judgment in favor
of the plaintiff.

36:18.534 --> 36:19.661
Adjourned.

36:23.021 --> 36:25.661
Well, congratulations.
Expect an appeal.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.235
I am simply wrought.

36:27.580 --> 36:28.436
Never did I…

36:30.564 --> 36:33.534
I'm sorry. I need a moment
to collect myself.

36:34.276 --> 36:35.266
Take your time.

36:43.603 --> 36:45.067
Can you imagine, Denny…

36:45.107 --> 36:47.285
if you were to lead
this country?

36:49.028 --> 36:51.668
We'd have Air Force One
at our disposal…

36:51.708 --> 36:53.754
my own personal
mile high club…

36:53.860 --> 36:56.180
Hit Vegas for the night,
Copenhagen, Bangkok.

36:56.220 --> 36:58.436
Gotta love a place
that calls itself “bangkok.”

36:58.476 --> 36:59.796
Make you ambassador.

37:02.779 --> 37:04.429
Denny, you make me laugh.

37:04.788 --> 37:07.628
Yeah, I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I'd make

37:07.668 --> 37:08.692
a fine president.

37:08.732 --> 37:11.521
What would you actually do
if you were Commander in Chief?

37:11.561 --> 37:14.267
I'd, uh, stop outsourcing
to the Chinese,

37:14.602 --> 37:17.210
drop a few bags
of grain on Africa.

37:17.786 --> 37:19.747
Is that where
they're starving?

37:19.787 --> 37:21.899
There and too many other places.

37:22.330 --> 37:25.879
I'd add France to the axis of evil.
Have they done that?

37:25.919 --> 37:26.909
Matter of time.

37:27.168 --> 37:31.359
Then… I'd invite Hillary
into the oval office…

37:32.928 --> 37:35.106
Give her a little taste of honey.

37:35.938 --> 37:36.862
That's vulgar.

37:37.064 --> 37:38.897
Well, what do you want
of the president?

37:38.937 --> 37:40.289
Oh, I don't mean politically.

37:40.329 --> 37:41.897
I know where you stand
on the issues.

37:41.937 --> 37:44.247
But what do you want
in the person?

37:44.306 --> 37:46.770
Well, one who could reestablish

37:47.130 --> 37:49.888
some of the dignity to the office.
That would be a good start.

37:49.928 --> 37:52.301
Dropping trou for Hillary
wouldn't do the trick.

37:52.341 --> 37:53.859
Ah, I was just kidding.

37:54.669 --> 37:55.197
Sort of.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.534
You know what I really think
of America right now, Denny?

37:59.574 --> 38:00.564
Oh, here we go.

38:00.974 --> 38:04.274
I don't mean simply its politics,
but our culture.

38:04.342 --> 38:08.653
We've become such a dumb,
fat, bubblegum nation,

38:09.141 --> 38:10.791
schlocky and superficial…

38:11.333 --> 38:13.247
Our music, books, television.

38:13.741 --> 38:15.526
One of the heads of NBC
recently said

38:15.566 --> 38:18.444
that the plan was
to get people to tune in

38:18.773 --> 38:20.291
and mentally tune out.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.588
And this wasn't an admission,
by the way, but a boast.

38:23.628 --> 38:25.115
You're starting to bore me.

38:25.155 --> 38:27.172
Is it any wonder that we have
a television show

38:27.212 --> 38:29.220
called “are you smarter
than a second grader?”

38:29.260 --> 38:30.884
and a president that isn't?

38:30.924 --> 38:35.222
I so miss a little…
dignity in America.

38:38.270 --> 38:40.670
I suppose I most worry
that if you ran for president,

38:40.710 --> 38:42.228
you might actually win.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.437
Ooh! That hurts.

38:44.965 --> 38:46.021
Coming from you?

38:47.757 --> 38:50.338
If you stopped all your nonsense,
perhaps you'd be a great leader,

38:50.378 --> 38:53.744
but, Denny, I don't want you
to stop your nonsense.

38:54.170 --> 38:57.730
Who would I have to sit on
this balcony with every night?

38:57.770 --> 38:59.948
So you wouldn't be
voting for me.

39:01.029 --> 39:01.887
Probably not.

39:02.394 --> 39:03.450
I'm too selfish.

39:04.875 --> 39:05.498
Plus you…

39:06.522 --> 39:07.644
Well, no offense,

39:07.858 --> 39:08.683
but it…

39:08.994 --> 39:12.026
I think your generation made
America into what it is today.

39:12.066 --> 39:15.366
It's time for it to be
inherited by your children.

39:15.625 --> 39:18.690
I think you need to hand over
the keys to the car to their leader.

39:18.730 --> 39:19.492
It's time.

39:21.813 --> 39:24.521
Well, maybe I could be
president for the day.

39:24.561 --> 39:28.019
Knock over Cuba, grab the cigars,
bomb Iran, then resign.

39:28.059 --> 39:28.917
There you go.

39:29.259 --> 39:31.173
That'd be a day, wouldn't it?

39:31.403 --> 39:34.947
Cuba in the morning,
Iran before lunch…

39:35.355 --> 39:39.211
After a matinée with Hillary,
maybe a-a threesome with Ginsburg.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.439
They both want me.

39:41.991 --> 39:43.179
Step down at 4:00.

39:44.079 --> 39:47.511
On the balcony here at 5:00
for a nightcap with you.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.116
That'd be a hell of a day.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.357
Then go fishing.

39:53.527 --> 39:54.781
I'll drink to that.

39:55.583 --> 39:57.233
You'll drink to anything.

39:57.871 --> 39:58.983
You and me, right here.

39:59.023 --> 40:00.079
I drink to that.

40:04.632 --> 40:05.754
Ahh. Denny Crane…

40:07.192 --> 40:08.182
King for a day.
