her 30 years in Lebanon.

was not in tune

22:18.249 --> 22:19.816

political details

22:19.947 --> 22:21.644
like my dad was,

was politically aware

22:24.473 --> 22:25.996

of State George Schultz--

22:41.011 --> 22:42.883
my mother, myself,

22:43.013 --> 22:46.887

of the program agency,

22:47.017 --> 22:49.846

very frustrating meeting

22:49.977 --> 22:52.066
and that Secretary Shultz

22:52.196 --> 22:55.069
really did not have
very much information.

22:55.199 --> 22:58.333
We had asked for a meeting
with the president.

that to the president.

an appointment

23:02.816 --> 23:04.034

he wouldn't have time.

23:05.688 --> 23:06.994
It was just a very discouraging

23:07.124 --> 23:10.824

for me.

did hear something,

the U.S. government

was doing all they could.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.962
They were just
being quiet about it.

It became described
as "quiet diplomacy."

23:22.139 --> 23:24.794
You know,
"You just need to be patient."

23:24.925 --> 23:27.884
To Reagan, quiet diplomacy
was working with our allies,

23:28.015 --> 23:29.364
working with the countries

23:29.495 --> 23:32.019
where we had
established relationships,

23:32.149 --> 23:35.065
not necessarily holding summits

23:35.196 --> 23:37.198
or press conferences,

23:37.328 --> 23:40.636
but coming up with some kind
of at least

23:40.767 --> 23:43.857
a short-term or daily strategy

23:43.987 --> 23:46.555
to try to get
the hostages freed.

23:46.686 --> 23:47.991
That was not an answer

23:48.122 --> 23:50.254
that my mother
was willing to accept.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.735
None of the American officials
were able or willing

23:52.866 --> 23:55.564
to give her
any significant information.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.827
And it didn't seem, to her,

23:57.958 --> 23:59.916
that they were
making any progress.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.657
So she was very frustrated.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.225
Carol Weir decided then

24:04.355 --> 24:06.619
to take matters
into her own hands.

to gain his release?

24:20.371 --> 24:23.157
Well, I think the government
has been at work,

24:23.287 --> 24:28.118
but I think a special effort
needs to be made now,

24:28.249 --> 24:31.644

to see happen.

what was essentially

24:33.341 --> 24:35.082

of any relationship

long enough.

that we were there,
