00:00.898 --> 00:03.397
- Previously on The Resident...
- Hey, it's a long story,

00:03.398 --> 00:05.549
but everything's gonna be just fine.

00:05.550 --> 00:07.430
This is not on you or her.

00:07.431 --> 00:08.598
I knew she was exhausted...

00:08.599 --> 00:10.190
Focus on what you can do now.

00:10.191 --> 00:12.088
Would it be moving too fast

00:12.089 --> 00:14.280
if I invited you to Thanksgiving?

00:14.281 --> 00:16.376
I spend Thanksgiving with my family.

00:16.378 --> 00:18.324
Maybe there's something we can work out.

00:18.325 --> 00:20.251
Jessie's gone, and
she is not coming back.

00:20.252 --> 00:21.327
You're all I got, kid.

00:21.328 --> 00:23.238
We're Team Nevin, now.

00:23.239 --> 00:24.921
On a first-name basis with Dr. Cain?

00:24.922 --> 00:26.864
We go way back... he's the
one who got me this job.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.214
You have no background in health care?

00:28.215 --> 00:29.238
I have a background...

00:29.239 --> 00:30.972
in profits.

00:35.265 --> 00:37.246
If I were back home in
Queens, I would be playing

00:37.247 --> 00:38.514
flag football right now.

00:38.515 --> 00:39.907
But you're not living your Thanksgiving

00:39.908 --> 00:41.848
- traditions because...
- Intern year.

00:41.849 --> 00:43.866
The only major holiday I've
gotten off is Presidents' Day.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.480
- Mm.
- How about you?

00:45.481 --> 00:47.274
You here for Jessica?

00:47.275 --> 00:48.516
Yeah.

00:48.517 --> 00:50.349
She sent her family
back home to Tennessee

00:50.350 --> 00:51.928
to care for her Great-Grandma Addie.

00:51.929 --> 00:53.878
Man versus turkey fryer...

00:53.879 --> 00:56.566
40-year-old male with full
thickness burns on his left leg.

00:56.567 --> 00:57.925
Okay, Bay Three.

00:57.926 --> 01:00.348
Ow, my leg! God, it hurts.

01:00.349 --> 01:02.363
I swear I just thought
using a turkey fryer

01:02.364 --> 01:03.665
would cook a frozen bird faster.

01:03.666 --> 01:06.585
Fryers make frozen turkeys explode.

01:06.586 --> 01:09.613
Over and under on turkey-related
injuries today is at a 12.

01:09.614 --> 01:13.300
You're on... 50 on the over.

01:13.301 --> 01:14.709
You'll see, Pravesh.

01:14.710 --> 01:18.104
Thanksgiving is the most
dangerous holiday of the year.

01:22.569 --> 01:25.069
And retractor.

01:27.148 --> 01:30.074
After we're done, there's
an orphan potluck here.

01:30.075 --> 01:32.343
I went last year... we
all said our gratitudes

01:32.344 --> 01:33.511
and everything.

01:33.512 --> 01:35.202
Family Thanksgivings are hell.

01:35.203 --> 01:37.157
Orphan Thanksgivings are worse.

01:37.158 --> 01:39.083
But what-what's worse than hell?

01:39.084 --> 01:41.995
Small talk with strangers. Dry stuffing.

01:41.996 --> 01:45.439
Drunk Aunt Sally getting
handsy under the table.

01:46.684 --> 01:48.759
Not my aunt.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.837
For me,

01:50.838 --> 01:53.149
being in the OR is the perfect holiday.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.250
No interruptions.

01:54.251 --> 01:55.772
No CEO duties.

01:55.773 --> 01:57.981
No rushing to get to meetings.

01:57.982 --> 02:00.013
To celebrate the holiday
for giving thanks,

02:00.014 --> 02:03.683
I'd be so grateful
if you'd let me close.

02:06.704 --> 02:09.295
Thank you.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074

02:21.809 --> 02:24.902
Is Howlin' Wolf too
throaty for Thanksgiving?

02:24.903 --> 02:27.013
Maybe Miles is a safer choice.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.140
Don't stress over music genres, Gussie.

02:29.141 --> 02:30.524
The genre is key, Mom.

02:31.028 --> 02:32.346
And stress is a given.

02:32.347 --> 02:34.014
I'm meeting my biological brothers

02:34.015 --> 02:35.198
for the first time.

02:35.199 --> 02:37.126
You're meeting my bio parents.

02:37.127 --> 02:39.186
I know Austins don't scare easily,

02:39.187 --> 02:41.602
but this one is quite terrified.

02:41.603 --> 02:43.628
Baked yams cure all... taste.

02:43.629 --> 02:44.711
Nah, I'm-I'm good, Pops.

02:44.712 --> 02:46.302
Acid reflux kicking up.

02:46.303 --> 02:47.959
Ah, hmm.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.409
Mm.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.131
- Hmm?
- Mmm, delicious.

02:51.132 --> 02:54.242
- Mm-hmm, of course.
- What's AJ so worried about?

02:54.243 --> 02:56.219
Oh, he's afraid his new
brothers aren't gonna like him.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.454
No, I'm afraid they're
not gonna like Miles Davis.

02:58.455 --> 03:00.241
Don't be silly... everybody likes Miles.

03:00.242 --> 03:02.167
Mm-hmm.

03:02.168 --> 03:05.188
I'll make you some ginger
tea to settle your tummy.

03:05.189 --> 03:06.380
Mm-hmm.

03:07.507 --> 03:09.942
That's your daddy.

03:11.086 --> 03:13.029
Yeah.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.357
? Well, my heart was a long time... ?

03:25.358 --> 03:28.286
I like it, I like it, but, uh...

03:28.287 --> 03:29.782
"sexy Thanksgiving"?

03:29.783 --> 03:31.050
That's a bit misleading.

03:31.051 --> 03:33.049
You don't think this is sexy?

03:33.050 --> 03:34.199
Eh...

03:35.277 --> 03:37.128
No work.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.170
No family.

03:38.171 --> 03:39.679
Nobody to clean up after.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.541
Just takeout, movies,

03:41.542 --> 03:43.375
and if you're up for it...

03:45.211 --> 03:47.594
My mistake... so sexy.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.176
See, see? Sexy Thanksgiving

03:50.177 --> 03:52.293
is the perfect way to give thanks.

03:52.294 --> 03:56.147
? My will is ?

03:56.148 --> 04:00.134
? Fading... ?

04:02.471 --> 04:04.138
Did you already order takeout?

04:04.139 --> 04:06.140
Nope.

04:12.147 --> 04:13.314
Surprise!

04:13.917 --> 04:15.199
Happy Turkey Day, Nicky!

04:15.200 --> 04:17.572
Dad, uh, I thought you went fishing.

04:17.574 --> 04:19.380
Nah, the fish will wait till tomorrow.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.473
I know how much you
hate cooking on holidays

04:21.474 --> 04:23.658
and cleaning up after,
so I came to take over

04:23.659 --> 04:25.250
and simplify things for you.

04:25.251 --> 04:26.344
Ooh!

04:26.345 --> 04:29.088
This is Sadie.

04:29.089 --> 04:30.297
Hi!

04:30.298 --> 04:32.350
She's my sous chef.

04:32.351 --> 04:34.335
Hi, Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

04:39.399 --> 04:41.342
- Oh, thank... thank you.
- Here you go.

04:41.343 --> 04:43.772
- Hey.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

04:43.773 --> 04:46.030
Wow.

04:48.189 --> 04:52.189
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:56.692 --> 04:59.247
- Yeah.
- Can you think of something

04:59.248 --> 05:01.328
that isn't made better
with a twist of lemon?

05:01.329 --> 05:03.163
Off the top of my head, no.

05:03.164 --> 05:04.882
Thank you.

05:04.883 --> 05:06.291
- There you go, Dad.
- Oh, thanks.

05:06.292 --> 05:08.386
Mm-hmm.

05:08.387 --> 05:10.295
I hope it's okay that we're here.

05:10.296 --> 05:12.227
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.133
I'm happy to see you, uh, but...

05:14.134 --> 05:16.544
who's Sadie?

05:16.545 --> 05:18.595
My friend. She's my friend.

05:18.596 --> 05:20.993
No! Nic, no, no, no.

05:20.994 --> 05:22.398
I-I promise, I swear to you

05:22.399 --> 05:24.184
my inappropriate dating
years are long over.

05:24.185 --> 05:25.219
Mm-hmm.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.311
How did you meet her?

05:26.312 --> 05:28.743
She came in ODing on oxy.

05:28.744 --> 05:31.392
They saved her, but...

05:31.393 --> 05:33.541
it was some scary stuff.

05:34.424 --> 05:35.684
But you know what they say.

05:35.685 --> 05:37.521
Addicts have to find their rock bottom.

05:37.522 --> 05:38.818
And she did.

05:38.819 --> 05:40.086
She's been clean a month.

05:40.087 --> 05:43.254
So this is her first
drug-free Thanksgiving?

05:43.255 --> 05:44.504
Yeah.

05:44.505 --> 05:47.657
You know how hard
the holidays are for addicts.

05:47.658 --> 05:49.183
And their families.

05:50.419 --> 05:51.995
Right.

05:51.996 --> 05:55.631
And I'm sure she has to
make amends with hers.

05:55.632 --> 05:58.668
I just need to get her
through today clean.

05:58.669 --> 06:02.371
I know, I know. Sober is her choice.

06:02.372 --> 06:04.230
I just, I just want to support her.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.752
And what better way to do that

06:05.753 --> 06:08.320
than a nice dinner with you and Conrad?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.997
Well, you should know
we're ordering takeout

06:13.998 --> 06:15.241
from Trina's Taqueria.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.243
Trina's "what-eria"? No! Come on, no.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.246
We got to do the real McCoy...
a turkey, all the fixings.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.533
You got to do a proper
celebration. It's Thanksgiving.

06:22.534 --> 06:24.696
Dad, there is literally
zero food in this house.

06:24.697 --> 06:26.085
Well, I can handle that.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.886
- Sadie.
- Yeah?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.462
Got to get ourselves a turkey.

06:29.463 --> 06:31.451
- Okay.
- And some stuffing, some

06:31.452 --> 06:33.109
- cranberry... Let's make a list.
- Okay.

06:33.110 --> 06:36.095
Right back.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.558
You know, I could just talk to Kyle

06:37.559 --> 06:40.041
and gently suggest he and his friend

06:40.042 --> 06:41.934
celebrate somewhere else so we can

06:41.935 --> 06:43.936
return to sexy Thanksgiving.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.271
Thank you, but...

06:45.272 --> 06:48.156
it is our first holiday without Jessie.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.199
Mm-hmm.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.885
Maybe he needs family.

06:50.886 --> 06:53.054
And I'm afraid that is us.

06:53.055 --> 06:54.280
Yes, it is.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.765
And I wouldn't want it any other way.

07:04.292 --> 07:06.610
Aren't you supposed to be at
Denise's, meeting her family?

07:06.611 --> 07:08.095
Yeah, that was the plan.

07:08.096 --> 07:09.854
Asked her to marry me last night.

07:09.855 --> 07:11.948
- Congratulations.
- She did not say yes.

07:11.949 --> 07:13.858
- Oh.
- Apparently she's...

07:13.859 --> 07:15.860
in love with somebody else.

07:15.861 --> 07:17.938
Ooh... Sorry, man.

07:17.939 --> 07:19.940
But it sounds like you dodged a bullet.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.441
Could be worse.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.135
Though I can't see how.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.540
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.676
- You, too.
- VIP, Bay Ten.

07:30.677 --> 07:33.706
One of you admit him before
the paparazzi shows up.

07:33.707 --> 07:35.588
- What do we have?
- Who do we have?

07:35.589 --> 07:38.316
Oh, my God, that's Delandre Harris.

07:41.755 --> 07:44.188
- Mr. Harris, it is a pleasure to meet you.
- My man.

07:44.189 --> 07:46.162
Your Sensitive Darth Vader impression

07:46.163 --> 07:47.658
is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

07:47.659 --> 07:48.851
I would do it for you,

07:48.852 --> 07:50.562
but I got something
jamming the pipes, man.

07:50.563 --> 07:52.243
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.244 --> 07:53.908
Did you swallow something, Mr. Harris?

07:53.909 --> 07:55.608
- Mashed potatoes.
- D...

07:55.609 --> 07:57.160
you're supposed to be eating

07:57.161 --> 07:58.812
mashed cauliflower, not potatoes.

07:58.813 --> 08:01.005
Manage my career, not my meal plan.

08:01.006 --> 08:02.499
I'm a grown man sneaking out

08:02.500 --> 08:03.784
to the kitchen to inhale

08:03.785 --> 08:05.485
some leftover mashed potatoes.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.979
Don't judge me.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.997
You've been there.

08:07.998 --> 08:09.165
We've all have.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.150
- Hey, I'm a stuffing guy.
- I feel you.

08:11.151 --> 08:14.355
Hell, with a little bit
of gravy on that thing,

08:14.356 --> 08:16.631
- Mmm.
- all goes down smooth.

08:16.632 --> 08:18.341
Except it didn't, 'cause something

08:18.342 --> 08:19.917
was in them damn potatoes.

08:19.918 --> 08:22.085
And now it's all jammed up in my throat.

08:23.289 --> 08:25.130
Damn achalasia, man!

08:25.131 --> 08:28.000
When was your esophageal
disease diagnosed?

08:28.001 --> 08:29.092
A few years ago.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.778
Even with a few procedures,

08:30.779 --> 08:32.020
it still worse than ever, Doc.

08:32.022 --> 08:33.780
Let me take a look, okay?

08:33.782 --> 08:34.857
Mm-hmm.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.528
Open up and say ah, please.

08:36.529 --> 08:38.010
Ah!

08:38.010 --> 08:39.371
It looks clear.

08:39.371 --> 08:40.688
Mm-hmm.

08:43.149 --> 08:44.781
I feel crepitus.

08:44.782 --> 08:47.086
Air where it shouldn't
be, so whatever you ate

08:47.087 --> 08:48.421
caused a perforation.

08:48.422 --> 08:50.347
You sure you can't just
butter up what's in there

08:50.348 --> 08:51.508
and just yank it up out of there?

08:51.509 --> 08:53.109
- No! No yanking.
- Come on, man.

08:53.110 --> 08:55.080
Delandre needs his voice
when all this is over.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.620
All right. Let's start you
with an X-ray, okay?

08:56.621 --> 08:57.645
- My man.
- All right.

08:57.646 --> 08:58.970
All right.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.674
Gobble gobble?

09:03.103 --> 09:05.029
Gobble?

09:05.030 --> 09:06.830
Not funny?

09:06.831 --> 09:08.171
You've done better.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.265
Oh, honey, don't be gloomy.

09:10.266 --> 09:13.710
My family's gone and I always
spend Thanksgiving with them.

09:13.711 --> 09:15.862
And here I am, looking like

09:15.863 --> 09:17.503
a freakin' lollipop and getting ready

09:17.504 --> 09:19.688
- to watch football all alone.
- I'll be here.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.423
I promise... my shift
ends in a few hours.

09:21.424 --> 09:22.648
You hate football.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.745
Love football.

09:23.746 --> 09:25.754
First and ten, Astroturf,

09:25.755 --> 09:27.614
Peyton Manning, "Da Bears".

09:30.183 --> 09:32.317
You're so cute when you're clueless.

09:32.318 --> 09:35.688
You know, football is
very serious business

09:35.689 --> 09:37.622
in my family... my
Uncle Larry once punched

09:37.623 --> 09:40.283
my dad in the face, 'cause
he forgot his lucky socks,

09:40.284 --> 09:42.786
and he ended the
Cowboys' winning streak.

09:47.768 --> 09:49.101
No.

09:49.102 --> 09:51.120
Go. Your patients need you.

09:51.121 --> 09:54.047
Just like my Grandma
Addie needs my family.

09:55.050 --> 09:56.721
I promise I'll stop feeling sorry

09:56.722 --> 09:58.110
for myself and I'll be grateful.

09:58.111 --> 10:01.781
I'm grateful you're still here.

10:01.782 --> 10:03.874
Me, too.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.430
So grateful.

10:05.431 --> 10:08.804
Even with this sad little
screen to watch football

10:08.805 --> 10:10.806
and this hideous helmet

10:10.807 --> 10:12.691
covering the scars on my head.

10:18.056 --> 10:21.725
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

10:21.726 --> 10:23.493
Hang in there.

10:28.083 --> 10:32.161
That is an intact turkey wishbone.

10:32.162 --> 10:34.814
How do you swallow a wishbone whole?

10:35.816 --> 10:37.499
However it went in,

10:37.500 --> 10:39.076
the only one way it's
coming out is surgery.

10:39.077 --> 10:41.487
And it's not as simple as
repairing the perforation.

10:41.488 --> 10:43.121
Might have to remove the esophagus.

10:43.122 --> 10:45.515
You want to break it to
the patient or should I?

10:45.516 --> 10:47.943
Looks like Red Rock's latest
golden boy's already at it.

10:47.944 --> 10:51.479
Mr. Harris, I have personally
interceded so you get the best.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.999
Dr. Torres here is a magician in the OR.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.909
A magician, huh?
Just make sure you don't

10:55.910 --> 10:57.761
pull no rabbit out my
throat, you hear me?

10:57.762 --> 10:59.338
That's a good one, man.

10:59.339 --> 11:02.024
I have to have Delandre
back on set Monday.

11:02.025 --> 11:03.692
Shouldn't be a problem at all.

11:03.693 --> 11:05.694
Mr. Kim,

11:05.695 --> 11:06.770
a word.

11:06.771 --> 11:07.938
Yeah.

11:07.939 --> 11:10.148
- Mm.
- Excuse me.

11:10.149 --> 11:11.942
So glad you're here.

11:11.943 --> 11:13.150
TMZ is outside.

11:13.151 --> 11:14.603
I'm going to introduce them to Torres,

11:14.604 --> 11:16.007
and it would be a nice touch

11:16.008 --> 11:18.023
to have the chief of surgery by my side.

11:18.024 --> 11:20.868
- Mr. Harris is my patient.
- Not anymore.

11:20.869 --> 11:23.226
This is a medical decision.
I'm the chief of surgery.

11:23.227 --> 11:26.198
Ergo, it's my decision, not yours.

11:26.199 --> 11:27.531
The patient's achalasia

11:27.532 --> 11:29.316
makes the esophageal repair complicated.

11:29.317 --> 11:31.036
Torres is a brilliant surgeon.

11:31.037 --> 11:33.467
To sign him, we won a bidding
war with five hospitals.

11:33.468 --> 11:35.464
- He's a star.
- I'm well aware.

11:35.465 --> 11:37.363
Then you should also be
aware that it's my job

11:37.364 --> 11:39.407
to keep him here, and that
means to make him happy.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.292
Even with a reputation for brilliance,

11:41.293 --> 11:43.485
a famous patient is not appropriate

11:43.486 --> 11:45.354
as a trial run for a new surgeon.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.614
Torres is young,
charismatic and diverse.

11:47.615 --> 11:49.491
He is the story that we want to tell

11:49.492 --> 11:51.260
to the cameras waiting
outside that door.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.257
But if something goes wrong,

11:53.258 --> 11:55.364
it's a PR nightmare,
which we can't afford.

11:55.365 --> 11:57.100
Don't tell me how to do my job.

11:57.101 --> 11:59.869
I have been the spine of this
hospital for over a decade.

11:59.870 --> 12:04.207
And amply demonstrated it's
too much for one doctor.

12:04.208 --> 12:08.044
A top tier of surgeons is going
to lead this hospital forward.

12:08.045 --> 12:11.323
I sincerely hope you can
be one of them, Dr. Bell.

12:20.875 --> 12:23.826
- Elf? Really?
- How could you not love Elf?

12:23.827 --> 12:25.905
- How can you not love Die Hard? "Yippee-ki-yay".
- Okay,

12:25.906 --> 12:28.029
- Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
- Sold.

12:28.030 --> 12:29.565
- I love John Candy.
- All right.

12:29.566 --> 12:32.235
Hey, Nic? Where's your turkey roaster?

12:32.236 --> 12:34.161
Coming.

12:34.162 --> 12:36.930
Put the movie on.

12:48.949 --> 12:51.090
Oh! Hey there, neighbors.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.938
- The boys here to feed the chickens? Come on in.
- Hey.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.389
I was actually hoping you
wouldn't mind taking a look

12:54.390 --> 12:56.008
- at Tommy.
- Yeah, of course.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.250
Sorry to impose,

12:57.251 --> 12:58.894
but Barbara's visiting
her family in Long Island.

12:58.895 --> 13:01.374
Tommy's been coughing, and...
I mean, it's probably nothing.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.282
No problem, Anthony.
I'm happy to take a look.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.617
He's a little warm.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.768
Did you call his cardiologist?

13:05.769 --> 13:08.621
I tried, but he's away for the holiday

13:08.622 --> 13:10.616
and... isn't returning calls.

13:10.617 --> 13:15.035
Now, let's see what
we got going on here.

13:15.036 --> 13:16.595
Dad?

13:17.244 --> 13:18.877
Is Tommy gonna be okay?

13:20.070 --> 13:21.542
Hey. Don't worry, Ryan.

13:21.543 --> 13:25.062
Your little brother's in good hands.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.984
Who pushes someone through a
plate glass window over a toy?

13:34.985 --> 13:39.135
Delusional, selfish,
narcissistic helicopter parents.

13:39.136 --> 13:40.952
Sorry.

13:42.306 --> 13:43.472
Just...

13:43.473 --> 13:45.115
I'm just worried about Jessica.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.565
She's going stir-crazy.

13:46.566 --> 13:49.645
It's not unusual after spending
that much time in the ICU.

13:49.646 --> 13:52.148
It's called post-ICU PTSD.

13:52.149 --> 13:53.907
Yeah. I know.

13:53.908 --> 13:56.152
Doesn't help me fix my
woman's crappy Thanksgiving.

13:59.195 --> 14:01.824
Dislocated shoulder. Bay 11.

14:01.825 --> 14:04.602
- Backyard football gone wrong.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.603 --> 14:06.420
You were definitely right

14:06.421 --> 14:08.730
about it being the
most dangerous holiday.

14:15.138 --> 14:16.329
Why'd you page me?

14:16.330 --> 14:17.811
Our splenectomy isn't for another hour.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.814
I'm reassigning you to assist Torres

14:19.815 --> 14:21.709
on Delandre Harris's esophageal repair.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.774
Torres? I thought you were doing it.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.564
I decided to be a team player.
Torres is taking the lead.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.275
I just want him to have
the best assist he can

14:28.276 --> 14:29.857
on such a high-profile case.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.187
You want me to spy on him.

14:31.188 --> 14:32.188
Yeah.

14:33.448 --> 14:36.375
Just find out if he's as
good as Kim thinks he is.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.195
Morally questionable.

14:39.196 --> 14:40.832
But it's a cool case,

14:40.833 --> 14:42.499
so I'm in.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.917
Bonnie, you see this house?

14:45.918 --> 14:47.703
Our boy's done well for himself.

14:47.704 --> 14:50.890
Maybe we should've put all
our kids up for adoption.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.509
AJ's in a different
life stage than our sons.

14:54.510 --> 14:57.563
Look, Lamar, I know you
mean well with our sons.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.821
Just, please, for today, give
Camron and Marcus less advice

15:00.822 --> 15:02.212
and more praise.

15:02.213 --> 15:04.851
Well, I am desperately looking
for something to praise.

15:04.852 --> 15:08.165
- Believe me.
- Don't say things like that, for example.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.317
- I was kidding.
- Well, get your kidding out

15:10.318 --> 15:12.061
before Marcus and Camron get here.

15:12.062 --> 15:14.943
They're meeting their full biological
brother for the first time.

15:14.944 --> 15:16.232
It's a delicate situation.

15:17.567 --> 15:20.403
And remember, they're grown.

15:20.404 --> 15:23.296
They don't have to spend
their holidays with us anymore.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.411
Are you kidding me?

15:28.412 --> 15:30.246
A purple man bun?

15:30.247 --> 15:32.198
Just leave it.

15:45.429 --> 15:46.487
They're here.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.265
- We got this, son.
- Don't worry.

15:49.266 --> 15:52.601
Your brothers would be fools
not to love you as much as we do.

15:52.602 --> 15:54.878
Everything's gonna be wonderful.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.049
So, um,

16:16.050 --> 16:17.643
Marcus, Camron,

16:17.644 --> 16:20.789
are either of you in the
medical field like your mom?

16:20.790 --> 16:24.115
Well, Marcus is at
Atlanta Community College.

16:24.116 --> 16:27.675
But he... will be graduating this year.

16:27.676 --> 16:28.918
Is he really though?

16:28.919 --> 16:30.995
Been giving us that
same line for five years.

16:30.996 --> 16:33.780
You literally dance on
street corners, bruh.

16:33.781 --> 16:35.834
'Cause that's where hip-hop lives, bruh.

16:35.835 --> 16:38.165
Well, how 'bout that turkey?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.462
You need any help, Carol?

16:39.463 --> 16:42.190
'Cause I got great
hands. Put 'em to work.

16:42.191 --> 16:45.290
Well, uh, Yee is the chef in our family.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.791
He's incredible.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.141
No turkey. Duck.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.006
That sounds wonderful.

16:52.007 --> 16:54.513
Well, that's one way
of doing Thanksgiving.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.413
The Austins celebrate
our multicultural heritage

16:58.414 --> 17:01.228
by having my father's most revered dish.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.954
Peking duck. It's a Chinese delicacy.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.883
Bro, you're not Chinese.

17:07.044 --> 17:08.936
Genetically speaking, you're right.

17:08.938 --> 17:11.583
But, culturally, my father raised me

17:11.584 --> 17:14.178
with a deep love of Chinese
heritage and tradition,

17:14.179 --> 17:16.255
so, actually, I'm about as Chinese

17:16.256 --> 17:19.376
as any third-generation
Asian kid with a black mom.

17:31.663 --> 17:34.015
With his heart defect, it's
good that you brought him over.

17:34.016 --> 17:35.441
I need to get him to the ER,

17:35.442 --> 17:37.185
where I can give him
a more thorough exam.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.565
Oh, my God. Should we call 911?

17:38.566 --> 17:40.855
We're so close. It's faster if we drive.

17:40.856 --> 17:42.373
I'm going with you. I'll call ahead,

17:42.374 --> 17:44.783
- so they'll be waiting for us.
- Okay. Come on, Ryan.

17:44.784 --> 17:47.136
- Okay.
- I will be back as soon as I can.

17:47.137 --> 17:48.533
Leave the kitchen for me to clean.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.549
I'm fine. Go.

17:52.718 --> 17:54.615
- That doesn't sound good.
- I'll deal. Go.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.466
Make sure Tommy's okay.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.009
Oh!

18:07.010 --> 18:09.646
Blackwell Award for Science.

18:09.647 --> 18:12.766
Glad to know you inherited
my scientific brain.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.768
Which I am grateful for.

18:14.769 --> 18:17.529
He had an early start,
growing up in Yee's kitchen.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.397
Cooking is chemistry.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.189
Which I am also grateful for.

18:21.190 --> 18:22.492
Bonnie, if you don't mind.

18:22.493 --> 18:23.769
We need AJ over here.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.254
- Something's wrong with Yee.
- What's up?

18:27.482 --> 18:30.408
I am fine, son.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.078
Dude can't stop smiling.

18:32.079 --> 18:34.504
Maybe it's the first signs
of a stroke or something.

18:34.505 --> 18:36.824
I mean, nobody's this
happy all the time.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.743
Actually, Pops is, all the time.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.225
Whoa. Oh!

18:43.226 --> 18:45.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Here,
let-let me help you with that.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.634
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad, man.
We're just trying to find

18:47.635 --> 18:49.353
the soundtrack to this circus.

18:49.354 --> 18:50.838
You feeling some '90s hip-hop?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.449
Come on, Cam. Just
pick Dad's favorite R&B.

18:53.450 --> 18:55.509
What do you got, AJ?

18:55.510 --> 18:56.826
Hey!

18:57.679 --> 18:59.513
Look, whatever you decide,

18:59.514 --> 19:02.187
let me put the delicate
vinyl on the turntable

19:02.188 --> 19:03.684
with my own two hands, all right?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.686
Each of these records is a work of art,

19:05.687 --> 19:07.746
and they deserve to be
handled appropriately.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.706
What you doing, an impersonation of Dad?

19:09.707 --> 19:12.342
No, man, I think that's just who he is.

19:16.381 --> 19:19.265
Conrad. What's up?

19:20.551 --> 19:22.852
I'm on my way.

19:23.685 --> 19:25.712
Was that the hospital?

19:25.713 --> 19:28.512
Yeah, I just got called in.
It's urgent. It's an emergency.

19:28.513 --> 19:30.544
Well, looks like the party's
over. We can all go home.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.730
- Nice meeting everyone.
- Sit down, boys.

19:33.731 --> 19:35.232
How long do you think you'll be?

19:35.233 --> 19:38.068
It's impossible to say. But I
will be back as soon as I can.

19:38.069 --> 19:39.720
And everyone is welcome to stay.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.388
Well, hopefully, it's a false alarm

19:41.389 --> 19:42.556
and you can return quickly.

19:42.557 --> 19:45.409
- Hey, you gonna be okay?
- Of course.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.484
Go. Save a life.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.527
- All right.
- Just, uh,

19:47.528 --> 19:51.231
get back here as quick as
you can, okay, son?

19:51.232 --> 19:53.216
I will.

20:18.284 --> 20:21.353
My college squad and I went
on an ayahuasca vision quest

20:21.354 --> 20:22.592
for Thanksgiving.

20:22.593 --> 20:26.240
I volunteered to carve
the turkey, but...

20:27.193 --> 20:29.527
Hallucinogenics and sharp objects.

20:29.528 --> 20:31.111
Not a great combo.

20:31.112 --> 20:33.264
- Can you wiggle your fingers?
- Yeah.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.651
- But it hurts real bad. It...
- Mm.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.596
Dude, has anyone ever told you

20:38.597 --> 20:40.908
you have incredible pores?

20:40.909 --> 20:43.601
Clean, but tight.

20:43.602 --> 20:45.418
But clean.

20:45.419 --> 20:46.844
Definitely still hallucinating.

20:48.198 --> 20:51.300
Joey, you're gonna need to
ride out your trip, okay?

20:52.553 --> 20:55.262
Let's take a look here.

20:56.615 --> 20:58.544
Hustle! Got to get out right now,

20:58.545 --> 21:01.476
- we got additional vics.
- Copy that. Go, go, go. Come on.

21:08.551 --> 21:11.072
Hundley, did Dr. Hawkins
arrive with that boy yet?

21:11.073 --> 21:12.964
- They're landing any second.
- All right.

21:12.965 --> 21:16.058
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Austin.

21:16.059 --> 21:17.318
Hey, back at you.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.769
What are you grateful for?

21:18.770 --> 21:21.973
A job where I am in demand
and far away from family.

21:21.974 --> 21:24.446
Hey, would you make sure

21:24.447 --> 21:26.856
there's a pediatric crash
cart in Trauma Bay 11?

21:26.857 --> 21:28.532
Already taken care of.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.614
Hey.

21:30.615 --> 21:32.650
I'm grateful for you.

21:32.651 --> 21:35.177
I'm grateful for you, too.

21:37.321 --> 21:39.151
Austin, it is good to see you.

21:39.152 --> 21:41.083
- In here.
- What's the update?

21:41.084 --> 21:42.751
Two episodes of syncope in the car.

21:42.752 --> 21:44.586
I'll get him on the monitor.

21:44.587 --> 21:45.680
Get an IV.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.272
Let's get him on oxygen.

21:53.069 --> 21:55.110
His heart rate is 150.

21:55.111 --> 21:57.508
I think it's atrial flutter,
but it's hard to tell.

21:57.509 --> 21:59.510
Trial of adenosine?

22:02.681 --> 22:03.681
Get the pads.

22:03.682 --> 22:05.607
We need to cardiovert. Now.

22:05.608 --> 22:07.518
Oh, my God.

22:08.854 --> 22:11.706
Let's give them some space to work.

22:11.707 --> 22:14.025
- Did Tommy's heart just stop?
- Come on, Ryan.

22:14.026 --> 22:15.876
- No! No, my brother's dying.
- He's not dying.

22:15.877 --> 22:19.513
Dr. Austin is taking
very good care of Tommy.

22:20.665 --> 22:23.534
I promise. Come on.

22:23.535 --> 22:26.595
All right, charge to 17.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.314
- Clear.
- Tommy!

22:31.043 --> 22:35.278
All right, let's try it again.
Charge to 33. Clear.

22:43.722 --> 22:46.373
It's gonna be okay.

23:04.743 --> 23:06.911
Did something fall?

23:06.912 --> 23:09.076
Yeah. Yeah, your father.

23:09.077 --> 23:11.114
He's terrible at the moonwalk.

23:11.115 --> 23:12.933
She's right, and I
should be able to do this.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.770
The '80s was my decade.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.941
All right, come on. Are you okay, Dad?

23:18.942 --> 23:21.776
Yes, fine. I'm fine.
Everything except for my pride.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.778
I guess I should

23:23.779 --> 23:25.763
give up my dreams of
dancing for Alvin Ailey.

23:25.764 --> 23:27.356
No, no, no, I want to see this.

23:27.357 --> 23:29.617
- No. No.
- You got this. One more time.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.619
- Okay.
- All right. One-one more.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.695
One more. Here we go.

23:33.696 --> 23:35.940
Oh, my God.

23:35.941 --> 23:39.163
Okay, that's walking backward.

23:39.164 --> 23:40.341
There's no moon involved there.

23:40.342 --> 23:41.784
You're the one who said I got this.

23:41.785 --> 23:42.862
Yeah, well I was trying
to be supportive.

23:42.863 --> 23:45.033
- I didn't know it was that bad.
- Oh, what? You can do better?

23:45.034 --> 23:47.615
- Hey, floor's all yours.
- Oh, no, no.

23:47.616 --> 23:50.146
Last time I danced, I
sprained my ankle, remember?

23:50.147 --> 23:52.623
Oh, that's right. Family camp.

23:52.624 --> 23:53.791
- Oh.
- Oh.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.916
That number we did was so embarrassing.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.462
Oh, for all of us. My
mom choreographed it.

23:58.463 --> 24:00.556
Or at least tried to.

24:00.557 --> 24:04.601
Nobody could do her
moves except for Jessie.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.371
Who's Jessie?

24:21.406 --> 24:23.597
Precise anastomosis.

24:23.598 --> 24:26.824
Your handling of the gastric
conduit is so delicate.

24:26.825 --> 24:30.228
At this juncture, it's
all about soft hands.

24:31.657 --> 24:35.009
Do everything possible to
limit trauma to the tissue.

24:46.119 --> 24:47.401
So, how did it go?

24:47.402 --> 24:50.295
He's an excellent
surgeon... skilled, efficient

24:50.296 --> 24:51.945
and a great addition to Chastain.

24:51.946 --> 24:53.930
Well, that's great.

24:53.931 --> 24:55.098
Even better.

24:55.099 --> 24:56.933
A perforated gallbladder.

24:56.934 --> 24:59.553
Too much turkey. It's
ours for the taking.

24:59.554 --> 25:01.046
Why does this holiday turn people

25:01.047 --> 25:02.939
into such gluttonous animals?

25:02.940 --> 25:05.549
I'll book us OR Six.

25:09.222 --> 25:11.722
Third call in a row.
Do you need to take it?

25:13.784 --> 25:15.952
Yes, Lamar.

25:15.953 --> 25:17.300
Yes, I'm still busy.

25:17.301 --> 25:19.046
Listen, you will know as soon as I do

25:19.047 --> 25:20.290
when I can get back, all right?

25:20.291 --> 25:23.050
Can page another surgeon
if you need to get home.

25:23.051 --> 25:25.934
Thank you, but...

25:25.935 --> 25:29.121
I'm happy where I am.

25:31.469 --> 25:34.821
His Glenn is unobstructed, but
his tricuspid valve is failing.

25:34.822 --> 25:36.877
Because of his hypoplastic
left heart syndrome?

25:36.878 --> 25:39.356
Yeah, and his lungs are already
starting to back up with fluid.

25:39.357 --> 25:41.157
Is he strong enough to survive surgery?

25:41.158 --> 25:42.951
Certainly not in the
hands of a mere mortal.

25:42.952 --> 25:45.843
But I'll be cutting, so
his odds just inched up.

25:45.844 --> 25:48.362
None of this is ideal.

25:50.292 --> 25:52.293
If the Petersons lose Tommy

25:52.294 --> 25:55.463
today on Thanksgiving...

25:55.464 --> 25:57.207
holidays will haunt them forever.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.393
I know. I've seen it before.

25:59.394 --> 26:01.444
Is there a way we stabilize him?

26:02.304 --> 26:04.106
We take the chance tomorrow?

26:04.107 --> 26:05.956
Hawkins, I wish there was,

26:05.957 --> 26:07.315
but we don't have a choice.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.082
Without surgery today,

26:09.083 --> 26:11.642
little man will not make
it past Thanksgiving.

26:22.725 --> 26:23.899
His pressure's been tanking.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.660
Hang two liters of LR
and get a bedside lactate.

26:25.661 --> 26:28.238
And page Dr. Bell.

26:28.239 --> 26:30.331
I know, I know. Don't try to talk.

26:30.332 --> 26:33.577
Okay, hang in there,
Delandre. Hang in there.

26:33.578 --> 26:35.412
Torres said the surgery went well.

26:35.413 --> 26:38.265
His lactate is through
the roof. Temp is 102.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.942
He's in septic shock.

26:51.883 --> 26:54.150
- Is he okay?
- Get him on Vanc and piperacillin.

26:54.151 --> 26:55.599
Is this a complication from surgery?

26:55.600 --> 26:57.267
I'm gonna need imaging
to know that for sure.

26:57.268 --> 26:59.812
- I'll get Dr. Torres.
- I already paged Dr. Bell.

26:59.813 --> 27:02.697
- It's Torres's case.
- Then get him here now.

27:02.698 --> 27:06.634
Linda, let's get
Delandre to CT. Let's go.

27:08.957 --> 27:10.723
It's completely raw.

27:10.724 --> 27:12.801
Well, the oven's not hot. Is it broken?

27:12.802 --> 27:14.468
It wasn't even turned on.

27:14.469 --> 27:16.737
- What?
- Is Sadie okay?

27:16.738 --> 27:18.096
This isn't her fault.

27:18.097 --> 27:19.745
This was my job. I'm sorry.

27:19.746 --> 27:21.216
I heard you ask her to handle it.

27:21.217 --> 27:22.717
Why are you covering for her?

27:22.718 --> 27:24.897
Did she just leave?

27:24.898 --> 27:26.579
She probably heard what you were saying.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.350
Sadie? Sadie, nobody's mad at you.

27:30.351 --> 27:33.245
- Sadie, get back here!
- Oh, no.

27:33.246 --> 27:36.789
These are my favorite earrings.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.235
Sadie?!

27:40.236 --> 27:43.181
She stole my jewelry.

27:43.182 --> 27:45.078
Don't worry. I'll find her.

27:45.079 --> 27:47.466
- Dad...
- She's gonna pawn your jewelry to buy drugs.

27:47.467 --> 27:49.453
I got to stop her before she OD's again.

27:49.454 --> 27:51.171
- You'll get your stuff back.
- Just let it go.

27:51.172 --> 27:53.122
It's not worth it.
You're not gonna save her.

27:53.123 --> 27:54.304
This is a matter of life and death.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.355
The last time Jessie
used, she almost died.

27:56.356 --> 27:58.156
She is not Jessie.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.608
Don't you see what you're doing?

28:03.184 --> 28:05.393
Look...

28:05.394 --> 28:08.323
I know that you and Jessie
had a special relationship.

28:08.324 --> 28:10.992
You were extremely close,
and it's Thanksgiving,

28:10.993 --> 28:13.995
so, you find this girl, you
bring her here, and she's...

28:13.996 --> 28:16.606
Same age, same issues, but...

28:26.151 --> 28:27.775
Is it a given that

28:27.776 --> 28:31.412
one Nevin will always
screw up Thanksgiving?

28:34.410 --> 28:36.252
I'm sorry.

28:39.689 --> 28:41.672
It's okay.

28:43.192 --> 28:46.695
Look, at least we
have each other, right?

28:46.696 --> 28:49.513
I am sorry.

28:58.374 --> 29:00.974
- You need to take care of this.
- I understand. I...

29:02.430 --> 29:04.529
Why are you looking
at my patient's scans?

29:04.530 --> 29:06.479
I was paged when he
went septic in the ICU.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.141
- I'm going to book an OR.
- N-No. That isn't necessary.

29:09.142 --> 29:10.886
Dr. Torres is here. He'll take over.

29:10.887 --> 29:12.979
Delandre Harris is dying.

29:12.980 --> 29:15.681
His gastric conduit is
ischemic, he's in septic shock.

29:15.682 --> 29:17.705
- A rare, known complication.
- No, agreed.

29:17.706 --> 29:20.671
I'm not saying you did anything wrong.

29:20.672 --> 29:22.196
What's your plan?

29:22.197 --> 29:24.715
I will rebuild his stomach
once I find the best option.

29:24.716 --> 29:26.384
Or we could harvest part of his colon.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.403
Colonic interposition?

29:28.404 --> 29:31.323
- We-we could do that. That would work.
- Great.

29:31.324 --> 29:33.400
Dr. Torres, get him prepped
right away and take care of it.

29:33.401 --> 29:35.763
Of course it's an incredibly
complicated procedure.

29:35.764 --> 29:37.149
It should only be attempted by a surgeon

29:37.150 --> 29:38.232
who's performed it many times.

29:38.233 --> 29:41.177
- How many have you done?
- It's a rare procedure.

29:41.178 --> 29:45.539
I've witnessed it a few times,
but I've never performed it.

29:46.304 --> 29:47.637
How many have you performed?

29:47.638 --> 29:50.899
Well, enough that my
techniques have been published.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.882
But that's irrelevant, of
course. I'm a team player.

29:52.883 --> 29:55.312
- It's Dr. Torres's case.
- Dr. Bell, uh,

29:55.313 --> 29:59.241
you're-you're doing the surgery now.

29:59.242 --> 30:01.001
Ask nicely.

30:07.234 --> 30:09.235
Dr. Bell, please,

30:09.236 --> 30:12.071
will you do the surgery?

30:12.072 --> 30:13.680
Of course.

30:14.574 --> 30:17.000
I'd love to scrub in and watch.

30:17.001 --> 30:18.935
You're welcome to.

30:28.954 --> 30:32.664
Last stitch around the
annulus, and it's all yours.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.202
Nice and tight.

30:34.203 --> 30:36.445
Stitching a heart the
size of a clementine.

30:36.446 --> 30:41.024
Now that is the true
meaning of Thanksgiving.

30:41.025 --> 30:44.103
Yeah, it is.

30:44.104 --> 30:46.105
Reinforce the sutures.

30:46.106 --> 30:48.123
Okay.

30:48.124 --> 30:49.291
Time to take him off bypass.

30:49.292 --> 30:51.794
All right, if this works, blood should

30:51.795 --> 30:54.846
flow normally through the heart.

30:57.467 --> 30:59.599
- His heart's not beating.
- I have eyes to see.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.121
Paddles to me now.

31:02.122 --> 31:04.290
Clear.

31:06.234 --> 31:09.144
- He's in V tach.
- Give 80 of amio, charge to ten.

31:09.145 --> 31:10.987
Clear!

31:16.986 --> 31:19.271
Come on, Tommy.

31:19.272 --> 31:21.790
I'm gonna get you back to your brother.

31:31.834 --> 31:35.786
A happy outcome, when I wasn't
sure we were going to get one,

31:35.787 --> 31:39.007
makes the moment of family
reunion so much sweeter.

31:39.008 --> 31:40.058
Yeah.

31:41.494 --> 31:44.513
Ryan's always been so sweet
with his little brother.

31:44.514 --> 31:48.758
So protective because Tommy's been sick.

31:49.479 --> 31:52.380
Well, you know, they say the
people we love most are the ones

31:52.381 --> 31:55.174
we take care of, not the
ones who take care of us.

31:55.175 --> 31:57.043
- Ah.
- Yeah.

31:57.044 --> 31:59.720
That's why it's been so
hard for Kyle and Nic.

31:59.721 --> 32:01.180
They took care of Jessie so long,

32:01.181 --> 32:04.032
letting her go... it's...

32:04.033 --> 32:06.000
it's nearly impossible.

32:07.036 --> 32:08.278
You have siblings?

32:08.279 --> 32:10.247
Only child.

32:10.248 --> 32:12.966
I always wished I wasn't.

32:15.888 --> 32:17.230
I'm happy for you.

32:17.231 --> 32:19.958
- Why is that?
- Eh, well, yesterday you were riding solo,

32:19.959 --> 32:21.764
and then, out of
nowhere, you got brothers.

32:22.834 --> 32:26.171
Yeah, but I don't think
you can manufacture the kind

32:26.172 --> 32:28.056
of relationship those two have

32:28.057 --> 32:30.066
with no shared history.

32:31.135 --> 32:32.944
Your history starts today.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.409
Wow. Well, you know what?

32:39.410 --> 32:42.145
With that shared
wisdom, I'm headed home.

32:43.239 --> 32:44.981
Happy Thanksgiving.

32:44.982 --> 32:46.916
To us all, my man.

32:49.632 --> 32:52.340
We're at 12
Thanksgiving-related accidents.

32:52.341 --> 32:54.137
One more and I win.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.942
We have half an hour left in our shift.

32:55.943 --> 32:57.443
Let's just call this a draw.

32:57.444 --> 33:00.208
And you should probably head out
to watch the game with Jessica.

33:00.209 --> 33:02.107
Not so fast, Pravesh.

33:02.108 --> 33:05.271
Gentlemen, a patient for you. Bay Seven.

33:05.272 --> 33:07.164
Is it Thanksgiving-related?

33:07.165 --> 33:09.124
I'll let you decide.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.092
Oh, yeah.

33:15.232 --> 33:16.657
Hi.

33:16.658 --> 33:18.401
I told him it was bad luck to hang

33:18.402 --> 33:20.327
the Christmas decorations
on Thanksgiving.

33:20.328 --> 33:22.347
I fell off the roof. Ten feet.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.256
And Rudolph and his
bright nose were waiting.

33:24.257 --> 33:25.332
I win.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.410
Oh, no. Christmas-related doesn't count.

33:27.411 --> 33:29.245
Let's just call this a draw.

33:29.246 --> 33:30.937
There's still time.

33:33.709 --> 33:36.568
Suturing the last piece
of the transverse colon.

33:36.569 --> 33:37.887
Is that enough blood supply?

33:37.888 --> 33:40.089
Yes. Textbooks will tell
you that the left colon

33:40.090 --> 33:41.591
has the best blood
supply for the conduit,

33:41.592 --> 33:43.851
but I find the transverse colon is best,

33:43.852 --> 33:46.005
particularly in cases like this.

33:46.006 --> 33:48.705
- Less chance of ischemia.
- Mm-hmm.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.417
Your grafting is impressive.

33:53.286 --> 33:55.825
You did nothing wrong, you know.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.391
There was no tension on the conduit.

33:57.392 --> 34:00.443
The-the anastomosis was
excellent, from what I can see.

34:00.444 --> 34:03.295
Complications happen.

34:03.296 --> 34:05.131
Welcome to attendinghood.

34:07.451 --> 34:10.286
I'm doing a lap hemicolectomy tomorrow.

34:10.286 --> 34:12.013
Care to join?

34:14.141 --> 34:16.108
I look forward to it.

34:23.634 --> 34:26.469
It's the best I could
do on short notice.

34:26.469 --> 34:27.578
It's perfect.

34:27.579 --> 34:29.472
- I thought we were going to PT.
- We will.

34:29.473 --> 34:31.206
- First I want to show you something.
- Oh!

34:35.478 --> 34:37.480
There she is.

34:37.481 --> 34:40.447
- Hey, girl. How are you feeling?
- Love the Bears helmet.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.385
- Nice touch.
- You did all this for me?

34:42.386 --> 34:45.007
I wanted to get you out of the
room. Have some game day fun.

34:45.007 --> 34:46.597
I don't know what to say.

34:46.598 --> 34:49.882
Well, they do. Don't worry. I
vetted everyone in this room.

34:49.884 --> 34:51.478
- Mm-hmm.
- They're fully prepared to talk

34:51.478 --> 34:52.958
- all things football.
- Oh!

34:52.958 --> 34:54.664
Go ahead. Test them.

34:54.665 --> 34:58.923
Mm... How many
yards are in a first down?

34:58.924 --> 35:01.170
Ten.

35:01.171 --> 35:02.171
Okay.

35:02.172 --> 35:04.119
How many teams are in the league?

35:04.120 --> 35:06.623
- 32.
- Not bad.

35:06.624 --> 35:07.982
Nolan,

35:07.983 --> 35:10.196
how many players are
allowed on the field?

35:10.197 --> 35:13.516
11 per team. Although,
many consider the fans

35:13.517 --> 35:15.518
to be the 12th man.

35:15.519 --> 35:17.413
- Okay. All right, guys, the game
- IRVING: Hey.

35:17.414 --> 35:19.476
- is starting. That's kickoff.
- Oh. Okay, come on.

35:19.477 --> 35:20.575
Yep, she's up.

35:24.377 --> 35:26.136
You did good, babe.

35:28.164 --> 35:29.289
Thank you.

35:32.594 --> 35:35.262
How's the Jell-O? As good as Mom's?

35:35.263 --> 35:37.389
Absolutely.

35:37.390 --> 35:39.065
You're a terrible liar.

35:40.134 --> 35:41.377
Mmm.

35:41.378 --> 35:43.562
Hers was like magic.

35:43.563 --> 35:47.049
You think she put a
secret ingredient in there?

35:47.050 --> 35:49.868
I think she was the secret ingredient.

35:54.908 --> 35:58.300
It's funny, life. You look right,

35:58.301 --> 36:00.879
and suddenly everything goes left.

36:02.566 --> 36:05.492
Medical screwup.

36:05.493 --> 36:09.054
She got so sick so fast.

36:10.516 --> 36:14.059
I remember sitting at the
table that Thanksgiving.

36:15.579 --> 36:18.414
We were about to say grace.

36:18.415 --> 36:21.250
I felt her hand was so hot.

36:21.251 --> 36:23.219
Suddenly she's shivering.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.196
She's back in the hospital, and she...

36:27.515 --> 36:31.427
She never came home.

36:32.612 --> 36:35.080
No wonder we hate Thanksgiving.

36:37.158 --> 36:39.602
I don't know.

36:39.603 --> 36:42.162
Maybe we can turn this
whole thing around.

36:42.163 --> 36:44.364
You can, Nicky.

36:44.365 --> 36:46.108
You got Conrad.

36:46.109 --> 36:48.277
So do you.

36:48.278 --> 36:49.905
When he gets home, let's just...

36:49.906 --> 36:51.807
Let's go to a restaurant,

36:51.808 --> 36:54.641
eat a nice dinner, hang out.

36:56.044 --> 36:59.068
I think I'm just gonna
walk this whole mess back.

36:59.069 --> 37:02.066
You'd have been just fine if I hadn't...

37:02.067 --> 37:04.627
barged in here.

37:04.628 --> 37:06.462
- That's not true.
- You're sweet.

37:06.463 --> 37:08.647
But I'm exhausted, and I...

37:08.648 --> 37:11.409
I think I'm gonna turn in early.

37:11.410 --> 37:13.135
Are you sure, Dad?

37:13.136 --> 37:14.470
Yes, I'm sure.

37:14.471 --> 37:18.081
Thank you for sharing the
evening with me, sweetheart.

37:23.446 --> 37:25.964
I love you.

37:38.127 --> 37:42.255
Linda? Up his fentanyl
to 75 micrograms per hour.

37:42.256 --> 37:44.149
'Course, Dr. Bell.

37:49.887 --> 37:51.070
We need to talk.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.223
Throughout the day, your tone...

37:53.224 --> 37:55.225
I saved a man's life.
I also saved Chastain

37:55.226 --> 37:57.060
the embarrassment of a bad outcome

37:57.061 --> 37:58.912
with a high-profile
patient. I think the words

37:58.913 --> 38:01.630
you're looking for are "thank you".

38:03.067 --> 38:05.084
I'm not done talking to you.

38:05.085 --> 38:08.130
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Kim.

38:11.633 --> 38:12.983
- Mm-hmm.
- Good night, Pops.

38:12.984 --> 38:15.060
All right.

38:15.746 --> 38:17.004
Hey, yo.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.676
You guys leaving already?

38:19.677 --> 38:21.528
Party's just getting started.

38:21.529 --> 38:23.316
Sorry, man, Cam's got a show.

38:23.317 --> 38:24.630
Yeah. Thanks for inviting us, though.

38:24.631 --> 38:26.916
Safe drive and happy Thanksgiving.

38:27.702 --> 38:29.277
Wh-What time is the show?

38:29.278 --> 38:31.521
- Huh?
- I mean, I just got here.

38:31.522 --> 38:33.114
I w-I was hoping we could,

38:33.115 --> 38:34.691
you know, we could hang
out for a little bit.

38:34.692 --> 38:36.174
You got time for a beer, don't you?

38:36.175 --> 38:37.861
Look, man, no shade, but the thing is,

38:37.862 --> 38:39.713
look, we've been here
for a minute already.

38:39.714 --> 38:41.364
I can have a beer with you, AJ.

38:41.365 --> 38:44.701
Look, I got back as soon as I could.

38:44.702 --> 38:47.181
My patient was a little
kid. He could've died.

38:47.182 --> 38:49.723
Great, so you saved a
life. We ain't mad at you.

38:49.724 --> 38:51.564
Seriously, we know how this goes.

38:51.565 --> 38:54.211
Our mom's a doctor. We learned
to make plans around it.

38:54.212 --> 38:56.713
A happy work-life balance
is really what you need.

38:56.714 --> 38:57.881
It's done wonders for Bonnie.

38:57.882 --> 38:59.326
We're not quite at the place

38:59.327 --> 39:01.110
where you get to criticize me yet, okay?

39:01.111 --> 39:02.886
Criticize? It was advice.

39:02.887 --> 39:06.062
Advice is criticism
in a cashmere sweater.

39:06.063 --> 39:08.558
You can keep both to
yourself indefinitely.

39:08.559 --> 39:10.233
You sound just like your mother.

39:10.234 --> 39:11.745
I was quoting Carol.

39:11.746 --> 39:13.588
She says it all the time.

39:13.589 --> 39:15.065
Bonnie says the same thing, too.

39:15.066 --> 39:17.892
- Both wise women, no doubt.
- Hey,

39:17.893 --> 39:19.736
you never back down that easy with us.

39:19.737 --> 39:22.243
I'm raising you. I
have to be the bad guy.

39:22.244 --> 39:23.451
I have to say no.

39:23.452 --> 39:25.141
Yeah, you might learn
how to stop saying it.

39:25.142 --> 39:26.726
Be the good guy sometimes.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.770
Maybe.

39:31.074 --> 39:33.750
Well, if you two will come in
and have a drink with your brother,

39:33.751 --> 39:35.510
I'll lay off you two.

39:35.511 --> 39:37.236
For tonight.

39:39.590 --> 39:41.758
What you think, Cam?

39:41.759 --> 39:43.451
It's your show.

39:49.934 --> 39:52.769
I guess I got time for one beer.

39:52.770 --> 39:55.939
Oh, my boys coming through for me.

39:55.940 --> 39:59.609
Ah, proud dad right here.
And I'm getting the T-shirt.

39:59.610 --> 40:00.868
You tell your mother I said that.

40:00.869 --> 40:03.113
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

40:03.114 --> 40:04.447
All right.

40:04.448 --> 40:06.616
- Camron, thank you, man.
- No problem.

40:07.876 --> 40:11.312
Oh, my. Lookee here.

40:14.959 --> 40:18.795
Oh, August Jeremiah Austin,

40:18.796 --> 40:20.378
you were a troublemaker.

40:20.379 --> 40:23.524
Your mother's been showing
Bonnie your wall art phase.

40:23.525 --> 40:24.801
Oh, and you didn't stop her?

40:24.802 --> 40:26.602
Look at this perfectly pudgy face

40:26.603 --> 40:27.820
spreading peanut butter

40:27.821 --> 40:29.472
- all over my brand-new wallpaper.
- Oh!

40:29.473 --> 40:31.237
He looks so proud of his work.

40:31.238 --> 40:33.650
He was even prouder during
his graffiti art phase

40:33.651 --> 40:35.692
- when he was almost arrested.
- Hey.

40:35.693 --> 40:37.647
You show me your tag,
and I'll show you mine.

40:37.648 --> 40:40.445
I don't want to see either of your tags.

40:40.446 --> 40:43.306
Bonnie, I think we dodged
a bullet by not keeping him.

40:43.307 --> 40:44.732
Lamar!

40:44.733 --> 40:47.211
- What? It was a joke.
- Oh, he's right.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.492
- That was funny.
- It kind of was.

40:50.919 --> 40:53.078
- Too soon, people.
- It was.

40:55.349 --> 40:57.191
Too soon.

41:09.572 --> 41:11.681
Hey.

41:11.682 --> 41:13.683
Let me. It's been a long day.

41:13.684 --> 41:16.348
- You should relax.
- No, it's good.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.420
I'm almost done.

41:32.304 --> 41:34.788
First holiday without Jessie.

41:37.808 --> 41:41.185
You know, she was such
a slob in the kitchen.

41:41.186 --> 41:45.732
Especially at Thanksgiving.

41:45.733 --> 41:47.217
I mean, the worst.

41:47.218 --> 41:49.336
And I was always stuck cleaning up.

41:49.337 --> 41:50.720
- Every time.
- Mm.

41:55.576 --> 41:58.460
Maybe a bit too much.

42:02.566 --> 42:04.466
I miss her so much.

42:10.741 --> 42:13.684
I'm so sorry.

42:14.578 --> 42:18.147
I'm really glad you're home now.

42:31.989 --> 42:33.990
Can I help?

42:33.991 --> 42:35.675
- Sure.
- Girl-girls,

42:35.676 --> 42:36.918
come on, be careful.

42:36.919 --> 42:39.236
Nicky, why don't you go
help Mom in the kitchen.

42:39.237 --> 42:43.248
- Okay.
- This is the best day, Daddy.

42:43.249 --> 42:46.642
I love Thanksgiving, and I love you.

42:53.027 --> 42:56.245
This is the best day, Daddy.

42:57.014 --> 42:58.773
I love Thanksgiving,

42:58.774 --> 43:00.708
and I love you.

43:04.021 --> 43:07.506
I love Thanksgiving, and I love you.
