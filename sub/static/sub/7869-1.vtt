00:49.246 --> 00:50.447
(grunts)

01:06.398 --> 01:07.332
It's 4:00 a.m.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.895
You kids should have been
in bed a half-hour ago.

01:09.981 --> 01:11.748
We're watching the
Nobel Prize announcements

01:12.053 --> 01:13.687
live from Stockholm.

01:13.754 --> 01:14.888
Ooh, the Nobies!

01:14.956 --> 01:15.755
(grunting)

01:15.823 --> 01:16.990
For Economics...

01:18.125 --> 01:20.193
Jagdish Bhagwati.

01:20.261 --> 01:22.462
Huzzah!
I had him in the pool.

01:22.530 --> 01:23.597
Homer:
Lucky.

01:23.664 --> 01:24.865
Quiet!

01:24.932 --> 01:26.900
It's time for the noblest
Nobel Prize of all:

01:26.968 --> 01:28.535
the Peace Prize.

01:28.603 --> 01:30.804
I would kill for that.

01:30.872 --> 01:33.773
And the Nobel Prize
for Peace goes to...

01:33.841 --> 01:34.875
Isn't this
exciting?

01:34.942 --> 01:36.676
Krusty the Clown.

01:36.744 --> 01:38.178
(gasping)

01:40.381 --> 01:42.217
Brockman: And now, to comment
on joining the ranks of

01:45.296 --> 01:47.664
here's the man who
always parks in my spot,

01:47.732 --> 01:49.299
Krusty the Clown!

01:49.367 --> 01:51.235
I'd just like to say:

01:51.302 --> 01:54.538
this thing is worth
nearly two million dollars.

01:54.606 --> 01:57.608
How do you like me now,
Teen Choice Awards?

01:57.675 --> 02:00.544
Kent Brockman, Channel Six,
and channelsix.com.

02:00.612 --> 02:02.913
Will you be flying
to Norway to accept the prize?

02:02.981 --> 02:05.515
I'm looking forward to
visiting the Arctic Circle,

02:05.583 --> 02:07.818
or as I call it,
my wife's side of the bed!

02:07.886 --> 02:09.653
For the purposes of
that joke, I'm married.

02:34.345 --> 02:35.946
Arctic Circle--
I just got that!

02:36.014 --> 02:38.782
All right, all right,
settle down.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.752
Homer, you're the
easiest laugh I know.

02:41.819 --> 02:43.387
How easy am I?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.788
Shut up!

02:44.856 --> 02:46.456
I'm gonna need you
in the audience

02:46.524 --> 02:48.725

Peace Prize in Oslo.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.160
(gasps)
Can my son come, too?

02:50.228 --> 02:52.863
He knows what to do

03:15.954 --> 03:17.554

03:29.867 --> 03:31.601
But no, Bart
gets everything

03:31.669 --> 03:33.603
because he's the oldest,
and he's a boy.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.572
And Maggie gets
what's ever left over,

03:35.640 --> 03:37.474
because she's the youngest
and she's a baby.

03:37.542 --> 03:40.143

stand and wave

03:40.211 --> 03:41.611

03:41.679 --> 03:44.648

Ew, no thanks.

Mom, this isn't

04:09.407 --> 04:11.241
Maybe we're not going

04:11.309 --> 04:12.843
Oh, I get it.

04:12.910 --> 04:15.712
Lisa: <i>They</i> go to Oslo,

04:15.780 --> 04:19.216
Well, you could get

specifically, The Hague.

Did you say

07:13.167 --> 07:14.901

Where's my Nobel Prize?

07:14.969 --> 07:15.768
There is no prize.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.537
It was merely a ruse

07:17.605 --> 07:19.138
to get you to Europe,

07:19.206 --> 07:21.174
so we could try you
for the terrible crimes

07:21.242 --> 07:22.775
you've committed
on this continent!

07:22.843 --> 07:24.644
It was all a setup!

07:24.712 --> 07:26.012
You gotta read
me the charges!

07:26.080 --> 07:27.881
You dropped a monkey
from the Eiffel Tower...

07:27.948 --> 07:29.148
Uh-huh.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.483
In Greece, you committed
something called

07:30.551 --> 07:31.751
"aggravated hey-hey"...

07:31.819 --> 07:33.086
Forgot about
that one.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.188
And here in Holland,
you stole the entire act

07:35.256 --> 07:37.857
of our beloved
clown "Van Kru sten."

07:37.925 --> 07:40.860
U bestolen al

07:43.530 --> 07:44.664
Gaah! Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

07:45.900 --> 07:47.567
One of the most
important skills

07:47.635 --> 07:50.403
a performer can learn
is dealing with hecklers.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.205
And... action!

07:52.273 --> 07:54.173
Top of the evening,

07:54.241 --> 07:56.009

07:56.076 --> 07:57.510

really a heckle.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.512
Right, yeah, right.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.182
I've seen more life in the
Wellington Botanic Gardens!

08:03.250 --> 08:05.184
That is a heckle,
but if you're not

08:05.252 --> 08:07.120
from New Zealand,
it loses some of its sting.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.421
How much?
Well, most of it.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.089
Do you think they
won't know the reference?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.824
If they did
know the Gardens,

08:11.892 --> 08:14.794
then they would know that
they're teeming with life.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.362
So, what do
you guys do

08:16.430 --> 08:18.231
when you're not
camp counselors?

08:18.299 --> 08:20.166
We're highly

08:20.234 --> 08:21.534
And as artists, we live in

08:21.602 --> 08:22.568
Springfield's most
artistic borough...

08:22.636 --> 08:23.937

08:24.004 --> 08:25.939

08:26.006 --> 08:27.974

10:40.607 --> 10:42.208
Monday was orientation.

10:42.276 --> 10:44.610
Tuesday, we did mime.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.412
Wednesday we did <i>Mame.</i>

10:46.480 --> 10:48.548
Thursday we got
attacked by bees.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.483
Friday morning, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Elaine Stritch

10:50.551 --> 10:51.651
helped us make wallets.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.319
Friday evening, we performed

11:04.398 --> 11:06.199
No!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.134
Good-bye, Lisa.

11:08.202 --> 11:11.370
I'll miss you a lot, then a
little, then not too much.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.941
(strumming folk chords)
Lisa, do you have
to leave this minute?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.642
No time.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.545
I don't want to get stuck behind
the joggers from the fat camp.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.314
(joggers panting,

11:23.484 --> 11:25.084
(tires squealing,
engine roaring)

11:25.152 --> 11:26.886
I can't go home.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.956
Something happened this week
that completely changed me.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.025
Oh, you didn't see a boy lose
his swim trunks, did you?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.494
No.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.096
I fell in love with theater,
dance, and song.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.732
We've got plenty
of songs in the car,

12:12.930 --> 12:15.265
You're usually the first
one out of this death trap.

12:15.332 --> 12:18.334
Well, the combination
of me leaving arts camp

12:18.402 --> 12:20.203
and you driving
on and off the shoulder

12:20.271 --> 12:21.805
has made me a little ill.

12:21.872 --> 12:24.340
Sorry. I guess I shouldn't be
playing this driving game

12:24.408 --> 12:25.708

Hey Lisa, how
was farts camp?

12:35.886 --> 12:37.887
(laughing)
Farts camp--
that's great.

12:37.955 --> 12:40.089
Arts camp was lovely.

12:40.157 --> 12:43.860
Did you paint a picture
on toilet paper?

Xeroxed sheet music.

13:06.217 --> 13:09.385
But arts camp encouraged us
to spread our wings and fly.

13:09.453 --> 13:11.521
Lisa, I went to arts camp, too.

13:11.565 --> 13:13.299
And all it does
is fill your coconut

13:13.360 --> 13:15.828
with banana-cream dreams
that can never come true.

13:16.339 --> 13:17.472
How do you cope?

13:17.540 --> 13:18.140

13:18.231 --> 13:20.933

13:45.909 --> 13:47.376
Let's see what
we've got here.

14:03.818 --> 14:05.118
Ah, here we are--

14:06.954 --> 14:11.791
Top to bottom, left to right,
readin' things is outta sight.

14:11.859 --> 14:14.661
Speaking of out of sight,
you've gotta hide me.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.031
I slept with the lighting
director's wife, and...

14:18.099 --> 14:20.400
(funky jazz playing)

14:31.062 --> 14:33.363
(noisy chewing, smacking)

14:33.431 --> 14:35.098
No appetite, honey?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.534
It's just dinner
conversation at arts camp

14:37.602 --> 14:39.436
was a bit more stimulating.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.206
One night we spoke only
in lines from famous poems.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.108
Because I could
not stop for death,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.443
he kindly stopped for me.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.011

14:48.079 --> 14:49.713
No, I was just
describing my day.

14:51.349 --> 14:55.285
If you need me, I'll be upstairs
saying good-bye to my dreams.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.455

to walk up stairs

15:13.505 --> 15:16.006

16:03.926 --> 16:05.593

16:05.661 --> 16:07.495

16:07.563 --> 16:09.464

on its artists.

16:10.966 --> 16:12.100
Uh, yeah.

16:13.369 --> 16:14.669

cold in here.
No heat.

16:17.373 --> 16:19.140

16:26.949 --> 16:28.583
What kind of artists are you?

16:28.651 --> 16:30.451
Sandwich artists.
But we get to eat

16:30.519 --> 16:32.187
any sandwiches we
drop on the floor.

16:32.254 --> 16:33.755
Unless we drop
them on purpose.

16:33.823 --> 16:35.857
They've got cameras
on us at all times.

16:35.925 --> 16:37.992
Are you saying
that arts camp was a lie?

16:38.060 --> 16:39.627
Well, not the swimming.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

18:06.315 --> 18:07.081
Region one.

18:07.149 --> 18:08.182
Woo-hoo!

We're region one!

18:09.285 --> 18:10.385

18:10.452 --> 18:11.986

18:12.054 --> 18:13.855
so I'm afraid your
exculpatory evidence

20:00.396 --> 20:02.263
It's good that little kid left,

20:02.331 --> 20:05.466
'cause this song is gonna get
into a very dark area.

20:05.534 --> 20:08.669
(playing minor-key chords)

20:11.974 --> 20:13.174
Good-bye, guys.

20:13.242 --> 20:15.209
I'll try again
when I'm older.

20:15.277 --> 20:17.011
Remember us for
our exaggerations,

20:17.079 --> 20:18.579
not our reality.

20:18.647 --> 20:20.815
And we gave you a little
surprise for your trip back.

20:20.883 --> 20:22.083
Is it your laundry?

20:22.151 --> 20:24.285
Okay, two surprises.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.254
(tires squeal)

20:26.321 --> 20:28.790
In a way, I think
we learned more from her

20:28.857 --> 20:30.758
than she did from us.
Yeah, well,
obviously,

20:30.826 --> 20:31.893
because we taught
her nothing.

20:36.165 --> 20:38.166
Lisa, look!

20:41.970 --> 20:43.504
Oh...

20:43.572 --> 20:44.939
Thanks, guys.

20:46.608 --> 20:48.409
How did we get way up here?

20:48.477 --> 20:49.944
Weren't we just back there?

20:50.012 --> 20:52.547
The magic of art.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.615
(jet engines whooshing)

20:57.853 --> 20:59.353
(door creaks, bell tinkles)

21:00.522 --> 21:02.390
Sorry we're late.

21:04.126 --> 21:05.259
Oops.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.727
(quietly):
