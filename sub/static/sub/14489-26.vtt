over and over?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.167
Certainly not.

sends you back 10 seconds,

Some kind of time button?

08:18.624 --> 08:20.501
Exactly. If she
says yes,

08:20.584 --> 08:24.255
I'll use it to make the sunset
last as long as we want.

Quickly.
Into the time shelter.

Someone stole the Time Button, and
they're pressing it every 1 O seconds.

out and stop them.

Because that
would make two of us.

(SIGHS) You're right.
We'd never get anywhere.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.523

to where we started.

less than 10 seconds later,

know where to send us back to.

(YELPING)

12:51.855 --> 12:53.399
I died. I'm dead.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.858
I'm gonna die.

12:58.279 --> 12:59.989
Come on, come on.

13:02.408 --> 13:05.286
Fry, what's happening?
Did you fall off the building?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.871
Actually, that's
kind of a funny story...

13:10.499 --> 13:13.085
He sure has a lot of
blood for a skinny guy.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.090
And I didn't
want to go on living

13:18.215 --> 13:20.050
without you,
so ljumped, and, well...

13:21.760 --> 13:22.761
Ohh...

13:22.886 --> 13:24.888
That's so sweet, Fry.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.226
You know those dreams
where you're falling,

13:29.310 --> 13:31.729
and right before you hit
the ground you wake up?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.022
Those are great.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.567
If only there were
a way to make Fry

13:36.734 --> 13:38.610
land softly, this
would all be over.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.031
Ooh, I know.
My airbag.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.366
Leela. I'm coming
to save the day.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.701
Hang on, Fry.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.620
You're just one death
away from being saved.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.415
And then we can
be marry me?

13:52.583 --> 13:54.668
Okay, I'm gonna
run out there.

13:54.752 --> 13:56.670
Then, you guys
form a human bus

13:56.795 --> 13:58.756
and crash into me
at 40 miles an hour.

13:58.839 --> 13:59.965
Ready?

14:00.341 --> 14:01.425
Go.

14:02.551 --> 14:03.552
(PANTING)

14:05.971 --> 14:06.972
(GRUNTS)

14:08.223 --> 14:09.350
We did it.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.392
Whoo!

14:10.476 --> 14:11.477
(ALL CHEERING)

14:22.071 --> 14:24.156
What happened?
Did I break the button?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.866
I think you
broke the universe.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.118
Everything but
us is frozen.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.377
What are we gonna do?

14:36.460 --> 14:40.047
First, I'm gonna get back these
earrings I loaned Amy three years ago.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.965
After that,
I don't know.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.101
This is surreal.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.770
Whatever we want is
ours for the taking.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.071
Hello?

15:04.154 --> 15:05.864
Anyone?

15:17.251 --> 15:20.337
I guess it's just
us for all eternity.

15:20.421 --> 15:23.257
Listen, Leela, I'm not
sure what kind of life

15:23.340 --> 15:24.925
we can make together
in this frozen

15:25.008 --> 15:27.594
time-sicle, but if it's
not too weird...

15:28.262 --> 15:29.972
Will you still marry me?

15:30.055 --> 15:33.392
I would marry you even if you
weren't the last man on Earth.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.476
(BOTH GASP)

15:34.685 --> 15:36.520
What was that?
I don't know...

15:36.603 --> 15:37.896
But I'm scared.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.773
Well, maybe we just
need some rest.

15:39.857 --> 15:42.067
We can get married
in the morning.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.027
Except there
won't be morning.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.196
We can worry about
that in the morning.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.908
Do I, Philip J.
Fry, take you,

16:31.074 --> 16:33.952
Turanga Leela, to be
my lawful wedded wife?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.162
You do.

16:35.245 --> 16:39.124
Do I, Turanga Leela,
take you, Philip J. Fry,

16:39.208 --> 16:41.043
to be my lawful
wedded husband?

16:41.126 --> 16:42.920
Uh, yes?

16:43.086 --> 16:44.254
Absolutely.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.758
(GRUNTING)

16:48.133 --> 16:51.261
There it is again. Leave my
wife alone, you glimmer.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.679
It's okay, Fry.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.641
If it keeps bugging us, we'll
either kill it or adopt it.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.768
Meanwhile, what do
you say we get started

16:57.851 --> 17:00.812
on a very, very, very
long honeymoon?

17:45.899 --> 17:46.900
(BLOWS)

18:29.693 --> 18:30.694
(BOTH GROANING)

18:32.362 --> 18:33.780
I think it's about time

18:33.864 --> 18:38.035
we drank the champagne Janos
poured all those years ago.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.288
May I read the toast
I was going to make?

18:41.371 --> 18:42.414
Go for it.

18:42.497 --> 18:46.460
I'm in no rush, after walking
up 240 flights of steps.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.086
And across those oceans.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.212
"To us.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.715
"If I could make one
moment last forever,

18:51.840 --> 18:54.217
"this is the one
I would choose."

18:54.301 --> 18:55.636
I'm glad you did.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.471
It was a good life.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.432
Kind of lonely,
though? Maybe?

19:00.515 --> 19:01.975
I was never lonely.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.852
Not even for a minute.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.651
I guess we'll never figure
out what that glimmer is.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.486
Nope. Pretty, though.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.780
Hey, hey, wait...
It's doing something.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.575
I'll protect you.

19:18.659 --> 19:20.035
Hi... OW!

19:31.755 --> 19:32.964
Professor?

19:33.048 --> 19:34.299
You're alive?

19:34.424 --> 19:35.717
Yes, it's me.

19:35.801 --> 19:39.388
Boy, did somebody hit you two
with an old-and-ugly stick.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.473
I thought I killed you
with the Time Button.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.350
Ithoughtso,
too, at first.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.978
But it seems I was simply
rotated into an orthogonal time

19:47.062 --> 19:49.272
that runs at right
angles to this one.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.233
I've been
tunneling for decades,

19:51.316 --> 19:55.028
searching every instant
from yesterday to tomorrow.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.988
We've been right
now the whole time.

19:57.072 --> 20:01.076
I wasn't looking for you, I was
looking for the Time Button.

20:02.744 --> 20:03.745
Oh!

20:04.037 --> 20:05.831
I landed on it
and time froze.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.292
I tried to fix it once, but then
I got mad and hit it some more.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.461
I guess it's good we
didn't have children.

20:11.545 --> 20:14.464
Oh, give me that,
you senile old idiot.

20:14.798 --> 20:15.882
Let me see...

20:15.966 --> 20:19.803
That goes there...
Lefty loosey, righty tighty,

20:19.886 --> 20:21.388
and,fixed!

20:21.471 --> 20:23.932
What? I could've
fixed it that easily?

20:24.015 --> 20:25.058
<i>You'?</i>

20:25.142 --> 20:26.143
(LAUGHS)

20:27.018 --> 20:29.604
Okay. I've modeled
the device to release

20:29.730 --> 20:32.274
a single huge
antichroniton blast.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.192
It should rip
us out of stasis,

20:34.276 --> 20:37.612
back to the instant before I
conceived of the Time Button.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.574
You mean we'll all get to
live our lives over again?

20:40.657 --> 20:41.950
Oh, my, yes.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.536
Even that nasty robot,
what's-his-name.

20:44.619 --> 20:48.790
Of course, we won't remember
anything that's happened.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.709
What do you say?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.544
Want to go
around again?

20:53.170 --> 20:54.337
I do.
