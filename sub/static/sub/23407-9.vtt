13:14.959 --> 13:16.970
No, you sound like the cookie monster.

13:18.844 --> 13:23.600
- Hey, I'm not busy now.
- Okay, Curtis, come on. This is easy.

13:24.478 --> 13:26.698
All right, you see
that line right there.

13:27.103 --> 13:29.376
- You see that line right there.
- Yeah, this one?

13:29.418 --> 13:31.869
- Mm-hmm. Now type in...
- This one or this one?

13:33.281 --> 13:34.845
- That one.
- Okay.

13:34.970 --> 13:39.023
Now, type that line into
this line right here.

13:39.039 --> 13:40.341
Okay.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.848
- Where, right here?
- Press Enter.

13:43.861 --> 13:45.906
Enter, okay. Where's that?

13:45.927 --> 13:47.208
The Return button, baby.

13:47.281 --> 13:49.297
Okay, okay, hold up, hold up.

13:49.422 --> 13:52.308
You gotta talk to me like old
school type of class, baby.

13:52.606 --> 13:55.424
Okay, left hand on 10, right hand on 2.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.609
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

13:56.642 --> 13:59.028
Don't tell me to press
Enter if it says Return.

14:04.555 --> 14:06.369
10 and 2.

14:07.894 --> 14:08.894
[BUTTON CLICKS]

14:13.642 --> 14:16.049
Curtis, just press any
key to turn it back on.

14:20.186 --> 14:21.874
I don't see "Any key", Ella.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.852
I see Backspace.

14:25.217 --> 14:26.359
I see Shift.

14:26.376 --> 14:29.220
Any key, any key, any key.

14:32.593 --> 14:33.857
Oh.

14:33.932 --> 14:36.212
Baby, it's not that hard, okay.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.481
Nothing happened.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.896
Look, Curtis, I don't
know what to tell you.

14:40.021 --> 14:41.821
That's cause you don't
know what you're doing.

14:43.848 --> 14:45.322
What are you talking about?

14:45.947 --> 14:47.241
You don't know what you're doing.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.560
Curtis, I went back to
school after all those years.

14:49.648 --> 14:51.043
I know how to use a computer.

14:52.319 --> 14:54.596
Well, ain't nothing happening.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.653
Well, because you must've
done something wrong, baby.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.527
No, it's my instructor.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.445
Well, I don't know what's wrong.

15:03.446 --> 15:05.189
Because you don't
know what you're doing.

15:05.814 --> 15:08.209
- This is for the laundromat, right?
- Yes.

15:08.225 --> 15:10.312
Well, why didn't you have
Ryan help you with this?

15:10.353 --> 15:11.698
He wanted to.

15:12.121 --> 15:14.067
Well, why didn't you let him, baby?

15:14.192 --> 15:16.414
Because he wanted
access to my credit card.

15:16.539 --> 15:19.109
Well, Curtis, why didn't you give
him the access to your credit card?

15:19.125 --> 15:20.510
He is the manager.

15:20.678 --> 15:22.710
He ain't managing nothing.
We ain't even open yet.

15:24.071 --> 15:25.860
Cause it's his job.

15:26.637 --> 15:31.551
It's your job to help and support me.

15:32.853 --> 15:34.873
Curtis, what do you call me showing you

15:34.886 --> 15:37.287
how to put the Internet
in and put the website in?

15:37.338 --> 15:39.475
I put websites in all the time, Ella.

15:39.664 --> 15:41.054
What website?

15:42.457 --> 15:43.641
Booties, baby.

15:44.675 --> 15:46.086
Big booties.

15:47.073 --> 15:50.219
Curtis, I know you're not
on here looking at porn.

15:50.585 --> 15:51.698
Nope.

15:56.368 --> 15:57.526
Uh-huh.

16:00.421 --> 16:01.581
Uh...

16:05.096 --> 16:06.826
What are you talking about?

16:07.615 --> 16:09.051
It's just booties.

16:11.753 --> 16:12.935
Just booties.

16:12.965 --> 16:15.758
Okay, did you erase the history?

16:16.417 --> 16:17.425
What for?

16:17.446 --> 16:19.340
Baby, cause I don't want
the kids to see this,

16:19.360 --> 16:20.638
pull this up.

16:23.019 --> 16:24.589
Ain't nothing on the screen.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.208
Curtis, these kids know
how to pull up web history.

16:29.372 --> 16:30.527
What's that?

16:32.014 --> 16:34.853
No, no, no, no, no. Move,
move, move, move, move.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.348
Oh, so now you want to,
now you want to act like...

16:37.369 --> 16:38.742
Really, really?

16:40.775 --> 16:42.980
Curtis.

16:43.189 --> 16:44.453
There it is.

16:44.495 --> 16:46.040
Wha... [LAUGHS]

16:46.066 --> 16:48.141
Curtis, what is all of this?

16:48.162 --> 16:50.039
How did you pull all that up?

16:50.606 --> 16:52.551
- Curtis.
- Hello.

16:54.074 --> 16:55.695
Big booties.

16:55.820 --> 16:56.943
You heard?

16:57.598 --> 17:00.483
- Little bootie bandit.
- Watch yourself.

17:02.948 --> 17:05.636
Black stallion bootie.

17:06.296 --> 17:07.744
And, the twerk bootie.

17:07.811 --> 17:10.671
Baby, wait, you got to
see her. Rewind that.

17:10.672 --> 17:11.746
Curtis.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.805
You got to see, that's the one
I was trying to get you to do.

17:13.829 --> 17:14.834
Curtis.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.896
You remember that night.

17:21.798 --> 17:22.833
You know what,

17:23.982 --> 17:25.645
mm-hmm.

17:26.404 --> 17:29.055
- Girl, what did you do?
- I erased your history.

17:30.579 --> 17:32.255
- Why'd you do that?
- Curtis,

17:32.486 --> 17:35.002
because these kids can pull this up.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.140
They know this technology stuff.

17:37.409 --> 17:39.659
- Kids can't do nothing with that.
- Yes, they do.

17:39.697 --> 17:40.856
Look.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.574
Lynn.

17:43.620 --> 17:44.716
Yes.

17:45.770 --> 17:47.139
Yes, ma'am.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.182
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come here.

17:49.228 --> 17:50.400
Come here, babe.

17:51.350 --> 17:54.105
Step up. What are you doing?

17:54.174 --> 17:57.372
I'm doing the bootie twerk
that I saw on the Internet.

17:57.393 --> 17:58.603
Want to see it?

17:58.604 --> 18:01.251
Listen, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

18:02.341 --> 18:04.632
Stop that, baby. Stop doing that.

18:05.611 --> 18:07.011
You see this, Curtis?

18:07.012 --> 18:09.656
- Oh, baby, they find it like that?
- Yes,

18:11.527 --> 18:14.765
yes, and you are not to go on
and do that anymore, Curtis.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.190
My bad.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.515
These kids know how to do everything.

18:21.086 --> 18:23.979
- I guess so.
- No, no,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.583
now you come on out here and
let's talk about this twerking.

18:26.642 --> 18:28.338
You're gonna show me how to do it?

18:28.342 --> 18:30.169
You know, there's one I
really, really want to learn.

18:30.186 --> 18:33.461
I wasn't able to see it,
but this is how it went.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.544
You stop it.

18:40.579 --> 18:43.409
I'm gonna show you how not to do it.

18:49.717 --> 18:50.918
She can do it.

18:51.237 --> 18:53.728
She can really do it. She's
gonna show you how to do it.

18:54.563 --> 18:55.689
Hey.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.272
- What?
- Hold on.

18:57.671 --> 18:59.180
- What, man?
- Come on, come over here,

18:59.197 --> 19:00.444
come over here. I need you.

19:00.649 --> 19:03.068
Look, I'm not in the mood
for your games, partner.

19:04.661 --> 19:06.488
Why are you kids so mean?

19:07.278 --> 19:09.408
[SIGHS] Okay, okay, what is it?

19:09.744 --> 19:13.013
I need your help. I need to
order something on the Internet.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.756
Yeah, yeah.

19:17.385 --> 19:18.803
Thank you.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.890
How much you pay now?

19:23.570 --> 19:26.289
The same free room and
board I've been paying you.

19:28.525 --> 19:30.147
I got you, I got you.

19:34.032 --> 19:36.316
- Where's your card?
- Ha!

19:37.676 --> 19:39.870
- You ain't going...
- Just give it to me?

19:49.293 --> 19:50.631
Okay.

19:53.035 --> 19:54.205
Done.

19:54.258 --> 19:55.937
Done just like that?

19:56.383 --> 19:58.289
Yeah, yeah.

20:00.504 --> 20:02.237
Can I go now?

20:02.483 --> 20:03.937
Please.
