02:22.766 --> 02:26.537
And you didn't see
anyone else enter the house.

02:28.838 --> 02:30.774
No, I did not.

02:32.542 --> 02:35.146
What were you doing outside?

02:37.447 --> 02:39.683
As I said before...

02:41.552 --> 02:44.522
I went to look for sinkers
out in the barn.

02:46.422 --> 02:48.492
Then, I stopped to eat a pear.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.229
A pear?

02:53.330 --> 02:55.266
From our pear tree.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.537
Then, I came inside.

03:09.713 --> 03:11.513
Are you...

03:11.515 --> 03:13.684
quite sure you can continue?

03:16.619 --> 03:18.188
Yes, I'm fine.

03:20.423 --> 03:23.861
To your knowledge, did your
father have any enemies?

04:18.982 --> 04:20.615
Yes?

04:20.617 --> 04:23.351
The new housemaid, ma'am.

04:23.353 --> 04:25.620
Bridget. Sullivan.

04:25.622 --> 04:29.690
In this house, you
will be referred to as Maggie.

04:29.692 --> 04:32.995
Most of your duties will be
confined to the first floor.

04:32.997 --> 04:36.697
Our bedroom... door remains
locked during the day,

04:36.699 --> 04:38.567
and the two girls,

04:38.569 --> 04:41.802
my step-daughters, Emma and
Lizzie, they're very private.

04:41.804 --> 04:46.310
You are not to access this floor
unless expressly directed.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.547
- Do you understand?
- I do, ma'am.

05:03.961 --> 05:06.396
It's actually quite
cozy in here.

05:07.864 --> 05:10.564
Feel free to bring
some things of your own.

05:10.566 --> 05:12.500
That will make you
feel more at home.

05:12.502 --> 05:13.704
Thank you.

05:15.004 --> 05:17.307
Within reason, of course.

05:35.692 --> 05:37.658
You'll have to excuse me.

05:37.660 --> 05:40.995
I'd completely forgotten
she'd put you in here.

05:40.997 --> 05:42.565
Such an awful little room.

05:45.768 --> 05:49.906
We have possessions stashed all over the
house. Not enough closet, I'm afraid.

05:53.076 --> 05:55.345
My name's Lizzie.

05:56.980 --> 05:59.047
Call me Maggie, miss.

05:59.049 --> 06:01.483
None of that Maggie
or Paddy business.

06:01.485 --> 06:03.050
Just picking
a name out of a hat

06:03.052 --> 06:05.987
for every boy or girl that
comes from a certain place?

06:05.989 --> 06:07.689
It's terrible.

06:07.691 --> 06:09.958
What's your proper name?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.696
It's Bridget.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.369
Your hairpin's loose, Bridget.

06:23.107 --> 06:24.708
There.

06:31.381 --> 06:34.084
Thanks, Miss Lizzie.

06:45.963 --> 06:48.697
That's a pretty dress.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.732
Will you be going
somewhere in it?

06:50.734 --> 06:53.535
As planned and discussed,
I'm going to the theater.

06:53.537 --> 06:56.374
You will not leave
this house unaccompanied.

06:59.475 --> 07:02.444
I leave this house
unaccompanied everyday, father.

07:02.446 --> 07:05.613
You heard me, Lizzie.

07:05.615 --> 07:07.783
And you me, father.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.084
The theater's my only
respite from this place.

07:10.086 --> 07:13.588
You're a Borden. You can't
turn up there on your own.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.956
The whole town will be there.

07:15.958 --> 07:19.461
Yes, they will. And so will I.

07:19.463 --> 07:22.734
I tell you this out of kindness, Lizzie.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.873
You are not helping your cause.

07:30.641 --> 07:33.141
Perhaps not, but I
will go nonetheless.

07:33.143 --> 07:34.912
Sit down.

07:37.448 --> 07:39.117
Stop!

07:44.922 --> 07:46.221
Midnight.

07:46.223 --> 07:48.025
No later.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.629
Thank you, father.

08:42.679 --> 08:43.979
Hello, Lizzie.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.514
Hello.

08:45.516 --> 08:48.019
Your dress is very smart.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.054
And yours is quite blue.

08:53.055 --> 08:54.523
We were wondering,

08:54.525 --> 08:58.527
why does your family
keep the house so dark?

08:58.529 --> 08:59.927
Father doesn't
believe in light.

08:59.929 --> 09:02.964
Why live that way when
you can afford not to?

09:02.966 --> 09:05.667
He finds it extravagant.

09:05.669 --> 09:09.203
There's always
gaslight, isn't there?

09:09.205 --> 09:13.008
You seem obsessed with the
concept of illumination.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.112
Are you, by chance,
an Edison?

09:17.613 --> 09:19.246
You know who I am.

09:19.248 --> 09:21.182
Oh, the face is familiar.

09:21.184 --> 09:23.918
Perhaps it's your scent
that's throwing me off.

10:31.354 --> 10:33.223
Hang onto her!

10:50.240 --> 10:51.639
Thank you, Maggie.

10:51.641 --> 10:53.743
- That's all.
- Is she all right?

11:01.684 --> 11:03.418
Is there anything for it?

11:03.420 --> 11:05.953
As we discussed before,

11:05.955 --> 11:08.322
medical options are limited.

11:08.324 --> 11:11.828
It's just one of her spells, father.
She'll be good as new in the morning.

11:16.433 --> 11:20.100
Is she under any undue stress?

11:20.102 --> 11:23.207
You know she's
always been very emotional.

11:40.290 --> 11:42.222
You're all right now.

11:42.224 --> 11:43.994
You're all right.

11:49.299 --> 11:51.131
Am I...

11:51.133 --> 11:54.134
Shh, just rest now, OK?

11:54.136 --> 11:56.770
Everything will be fine.

11:56.772 --> 11:59.309
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.948
Say it like you mean it.

12:08.318 --> 12:10.420
Everything will be fine.

12:11.788 --> 12:14.058
It will, Lizzie. It will.

12:23.433 --> 12:25.136
Nothing at all?

12:29.072 --> 12:31.438
It really is difficult to
harbor sympathy for someone

12:31.440 --> 12:35.509
who will not make even the
slightest effort to help herself.

12:50.025 --> 12:51.759
Hello, Henry.

12:51.761 --> 12:53.463
What should we hear today?

12:55.766 --> 12:57.801
Do you have any suggestions?

13:19.021 --> 13:22.222
Love alters not
with brief hours and weeks,

13:22.224 --> 13:23.793
but bears it out...

13:28.931 --> 13:31.231
Let me not to the
marriage of true mind's

13:31.233 --> 13:33.433
impme... impediments...

13:37.274 --> 13:39.009
Pardon me.

13:40.242 --> 13:42.112
Impediments.

13:44.948 --> 13:48.385
It's a much nicer word
for "obstacle," don't you think?

13:53.990 --> 13:55.525
Have you had schooling?

13:58.895 --> 14:00.197
Some.

14:01.997 --> 14:03.900
How much is some?

14:05.901 --> 14:07.470
Couple years.

14:10.607 --> 14:12.142
Are you afraid?

14:13.209 --> 14:14.844
Afraid?

14:18.214 --> 14:19.449
Of what?

14:21.483 --> 14:23.887
Men don't have to
know things, Bridget.

14:24.954 --> 14:26.357
Women do.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.277
It's called...
That...

14:49.011 --> 14:52.816
Girl.

14:53.916 --> 14:55.350
Her...

14:55.352 --> 14:57.384
Her hood...

14:57.386 --> 14:59.453
is...

14:59.455 --> 15:02.325
of the... com...

15:03.392 --> 15:05.158
Common...

15:05.160 --> 15:07.528
- Common
- Common. Common

15:07.530 --> 15:09.934
Her hood is of the common.

15:13.035 --> 15:16.203
Her hood is of the common sort.

15:16.205 --> 15:18.074
Her...

15:23.646 --> 15:25.015
Miss.

15:28.617 --> 15:30.220
You all right?

15:35.091 --> 15:36.356
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:36.358 --> 15:38.326
You sure?

15:38.328 --> 15:41.098
- Yeah, it's passed.
- Maybe we should stop.

15:43.232 --> 15:45.265
I'm fine. I never know
when they're gonna happen.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.434
Let's carry on.

15:47.436 --> 15:49.072
Her dress...

16:46.029 --> 16:47.628
Afternoon, Maggie.

16:47.630 --> 16:49.533
Afternoon, Mr. Borden.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.269
I just, uh, wanna
let you know that...

16:54.771 --> 16:56.637
We all think you're going a...

16:56.639 --> 16:58.639
fine job here.

16:58.641 --> 17:00.640
Thank you, sir.

17:00.642 --> 17:03.311
Do you find your
room comfortable?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.113
Yes, sir.

17:05.115 --> 17:07.084
It can get quite hot up there.

17:08.151 --> 17:09.415
I don't mind, sir.

17:09.417 --> 17:11.752
Sometimes, it's best to
leave the door open.

17:11.753 --> 17:13.556
Let the air circulate.

17:22.098 --> 17:24.268
I'm very grateful to be here.

17:25.769 --> 17:28.068
Perhaps you could
do with a raise.

17:28.069 --> 17:29.369
A small raise.

17:29.371 --> 17:31.372
That's very kind of you, Sir.

17:31.374 --> 17:32.710
Well.

17:34.543 --> 17:36.312
Wouldn't wanna lose you.

18:27.363 --> 18:29.466
Be a sweet girl, Maggie.

18:35.504 --> 18:37.507
It's all right.

19:38.201 --> 19:41.669
I see you've
taken over my hiding place.

19:41.671 --> 19:43.837
Not hiding.

19:43.839 --> 19:45.306
No?

19:45.308 --> 19:47.111
No.

19:48.243 --> 19:49.713
Just...

19:51.280 --> 19:53.349
Taking a rest, that's all.

19:59.655 --> 20:01.524
I brought you something.

20:03.559 --> 20:06.496
I marked a few I thought
you might start with.

22:13.690 --> 22:15.659
Show yourself!

22:49.058 --> 22:53.426
Perhaps it's time we tell the
constable about these threats.

22:53.428 --> 22:56.565
It's our affair, and
it will remain that way.

23:11.748 --> 23:13.817
Father, have you
done something?

23:14.916 --> 23:16.517
I only mean...

23:16.519 --> 23:18.519
Some of the land
you've recently acquired...

23:18.521 --> 23:20.587
<i>We</i> have acquired, Lizzie.

23:20.589 --> 23:21.791
We.

23:22.858 --> 23:25.960
They're simple farmers.

23:25.962 --> 23:28.796
They don't understand what's happened
to their holdings. Perhaps...

23:28.798 --> 23:32.868
Perhaps if they had made good on their
loans, the land would still be theirs.

23:35.838 --> 23:38.541
Have I done something?

23:39.975 --> 23:43.810
Your arrogance borders
on the stupefying.

23:43.812 --> 23:47.815
You and your desperate attempts
to play the society major.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.049
You gossip with them,
don't you?

23:50.051 --> 23:54.654
You talk about me, and you talk to
their husbands, and it's all a game.

23:54.656 --> 23:56.089
No, father...

23:56.091 --> 23:58.124
Your wanton displays,
your public spells.

23:58.126 --> 24:01.998
You lay us open to
ridicule and attack.

24:03.665 --> 24:05.635
We are vulnerable now, Lizzie.

24:07.203 --> 24:09.873
Do you not see that
that's because of you?

24:10.940 --> 24:12.943
Yes, you must be right.

24:35.697 --> 24:37.730
I know you want to
proceed conservatively,

24:37.732 --> 24:40.601
but with your land holdings
tripling these past few years,

24:40.603 --> 24:43.002
we will need
additional support.

24:43.004 --> 24:45.972
A large facility would be
a wise investment.

24:45.974 --> 24:48.576
- I don't want to spend any more than necessary.
- I know.

24:48.578 --> 24:50.044
If there's one thing I know
about you, Andrew,

24:50.046 --> 24:52.145
every nickel spent is
a nickel missed.

24:52.147 --> 24:53.780
You mean every penny.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.153
Oh, Lizzie.

24:59.155 --> 25:01.788
Uh, come and say hello
to your uncle John.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.460
He's come a long way.

25:04.527 --> 25:06.192
Out on the town?

25:06.194 --> 25:08.127
Abby, John
and I have work to do.

25:08.129 --> 25:10.166
- If you don't mind
- Yes, of course.

25:13.101 --> 25:15.171
Come along now, Lizzie.

25:19.709 --> 25:21.842
Lizzie. Close the door, please.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.713
I can manage.

25:39.662 --> 25:42.566
Something I'd
like you to see, John.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.948
All in the same hand?

26:00.950 --> 26:02.282
They are.

26:02.284 --> 26:05.653
I worry for the girls, mostly.

26:05.655 --> 26:07.824
Some nights, I barely sleep.

26:09.224 --> 26:11.592
You believe these
threats are genuine?

26:11.594 --> 26:14.728
It's time I put my affairs in order.
If something's gonna happen to me...

26:14.730 --> 26:16.564
Oh, don't talk nonsense.

26:16.566 --> 26:18.798
The girls will need
looking after.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.568
Someone to guard and
maintain their finances,

26:21.570 --> 26:23.839
as you've always
suggested, John.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.743
Woah, um...

26:29.078 --> 26:31.514
Ah, your girls, they've
never taken to me.

26:32.781 --> 26:34.815
Emma, maybe, but...

26:34.817 --> 26:38.085
Lizzie... No.

26:38.087 --> 26:41.821
They know nothing of the matters
of the world. Especially Lizzie.

26:41.823 --> 26:43.990
How's her health?

26:43.992 --> 26:46.162
If you don't mind my asking.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.829
Worse.

26:49.831 --> 26:53.602
Dr. Bowen recommends
institutionalization, but...

26:54.936 --> 26:57.173
the thought of
sending her away...

26:58.907 --> 27:02.678
Though, it may be...
inevitable.

27:04.012 --> 27:07.047
This is why I need someone

27:07.049 --> 27:09.149
to operate on their behalf

27:09.151 --> 27:11.054
without sentiment.

27:13.088 --> 27:15.157
I know it's
an imposition.

27:17.193 --> 27:19.128
Will you do that for me, John?

27:21.196 --> 27:23.364
Will you promise me?

27:23.366 --> 27:24.999
I promise.

27:25.001 --> 27:26.670
I'll try.

27:29.070 --> 27:33.140
I'd like you to stay on a few
days, if you don't mind.

27:33.142 --> 27:36.146
I'll have Maggie
set up the guest room.

28:15.251 --> 28:19.987
Your mother was just about
your age when that was taken.

28:19.989 --> 28:23.089
I too often forget how
beautiful she was.

28:23.091 --> 28:25.392
Yes, she was.

28:25.394 --> 28:27.262
We all miss her.

28:29.365 --> 28:31.800
I want us to make
a new beginning.

28:44.780 --> 28:47.083
That's exactly what
I want, father.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.467
Father won't believe
someone broke in.

29:40.469 --> 29:42.405
You'll only make things worse.

29:43.472 --> 29:45.308
Shut your mouth, Emma.

29:55.216 --> 29:57.186
Good afternoon.

29:59.355 --> 30:01.091
How much for all of it?

30:08.463 --> 30:11.298
Thank you,
Emma. Lizzie.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.366
Is your Maggie at home?

30:13.368 --> 30:16.002
I'm sure she's here somewhere.

30:16.004 --> 30:17.971
I'm right here, sir.

30:17.973 --> 30:23.009
- Were you home at the time of the robbery, Miss...
- Sullivan

30:23.011 --> 30:25.848
- I was hanging shades
- She wouldn't steal from us.

30:26.948 --> 30:28.484
Didn't hear anything, then?

30:30.185 --> 30:33.019
No strange noises?

30:33.021 --> 30:35.058
Didn't see anyone
fleeing the scene?

30:36.125 --> 30:38.525
No. Not that I recall, sir.

30:38.527 --> 30:40.894
Not to be indelicate,
Miss Sullivan,

30:40.896 --> 30:43.564
but would you mind if we took
a look around your room?

30:43.566 --> 30:45.298
That won't be necessary.

30:45.300 --> 30:48.568
What do you mean,
"that won't be necessary"?

30:48.570 --> 30:51.174
Might I speak to you in
private, Deputy Fleet?

30:56.044 --> 31:00.115
The owner of Pawn &
Thrift paid a visit to my office.

31:31.113 --> 31:35.018
We will not be
victimized by fear.

31:38.020 --> 31:39.521
No.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.328
No! No!

31:49.330 --> 31:50.596
Stop it!

31:50.598 --> 31:53.165
Ah!

31:53.167 --> 31:55.134
Damn it!

31:55.136 --> 31:56.269
No!

32:00.541 --> 32:03.245
Damn it!

33:26.528 --> 33:28.164
Eat, Lizzie.

33:32.001 --> 33:35.335
I said you will eat.

33:35.337 --> 33:40.406
She doesn't have to eat
if she's not hungry, Andrew.

33:40.408 --> 33:43.445
Yes, maybe your wife would
like mine. She looks hungry.

33:48.050 --> 33:50.717
Uncle John looks hungry too.

33:50.719 --> 33:55.622
There's more than enough to go
around, isn't there, father?

33:55.624 --> 33:59.259
You think you're
just gonna ship us off?

33:59.261 --> 34:02.528
Throw the old maids
out like scraps?

34:02.530 --> 34:05.298
Give it all to the pervert and
the old cow, it that it?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.537
You will not speak
to me like this.

34:09.670 --> 34:13.272
You will apologize to
your mother and your uncle John.

34:13.274 --> 34:16.176
Don't you dare
call her my mother.

34:16.178 --> 34:18.043
Apologize.

34:18.045 --> 34:19.648
You're a coward, father.

34:23.717 --> 34:25.754
A coward and a liar!

34:29.456 --> 34:31.424
Oh!

34:31.426 --> 34:35.496
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

34:40.301 --> 34:43.205
I will not be
treated this way, Lizzie!

35:01.390 --> 35:03.089
Open the door!

35:04.392 --> 35:05.591
Lizzie!

35:07.863 --> 35:09.696
Lizzie, stop this!

35:13.734 --> 35:15.201
Lizzie!

35:32.354 --> 35:34.488
Oh, Lizzie.

35:34.490 --> 35:37.459
They will take you away now.
Don't you know that?

35:40.828 --> 35:43.298
Maggie, draw her a bath.

35:46.635 --> 35:48.171
Did I...

35:49.238 --> 35:51.140
You had a spell.

35:56.310 --> 35:59.347
You're all right.
Let me help you.

36:06.388 --> 36:08.156
Is it ruined?

36:09.591 --> 36:11.491
We can save it.

36:11.493 --> 36:13.463
It's nothing.

36:16.164 --> 36:17.432
You must be freezing.

36:45.961 --> 36:49.296
I cannot discuss
this with you, Lizzie.

36:49.298 --> 36:51.964
Decisions are being
made on my behalf.

36:51.966 --> 36:57.303
I have a right to know if my inheritance
has been abused or squandered, don't I?

36:57.305 --> 36:59.305
What else has been done?

36:59.307 --> 37:01.908
You must know
that's confidential.

37:01.910 --> 37:07.346
Perhaps it's something you should
raise directly with your father.

37:07.348 --> 37:09.649
You're the family attorney.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.854
Am I not a member
of the family?

37:14.356 --> 37:17.691
I know nothing of
your father's intentions,

37:17.693 --> 37:21.328
and even if I chose to break
his confidence, which I cannot,

37:21.330 --> 37:24.330
We keep no copies
in the office.

37:24.332 --> 37:26.501
You father would
never allow it.

37:28.470 --> 37:31.537
Mr. Jennings, speak plainly.

37:31.539 --> 37:34.576
Is John Morse to be the
custodian of my inheritance?

37:36.544 --> 37:41.348
I'm sure your uncle has only the
family's best interest at heart.

37:41.350 --> 37:44.450
My uncle is nothing but
a failed horse trader.

37:44.452 --> 37:47.520
- Lizzie...
- He is a liar and a fraud.

37:47.522 --> 37:52.725
My father only keeps his counsel out of some
adolescent need for male companionship.

37:52.727 --> 37:55.495
He is unfit, Mr. Jennings.

37:55.497 --> 37:58.631
You know this, yet you
do not contradict my father.

37:58.633 --> 38:01.267
You allow him to destroy
us all on a whim?

38:01.269 --> 38:04.573
Do you feel no responsibility
to me or to my sister?

38:27.828 --> 38:29.531
Got a letter.

38:30.865 --> 38:32.701
I can read some of it.

38:34.903 --> 38:37.540
Just... Just read it.

38:39.807 --> 38:43.310
Attempts were made to contact
you on several occasions,

38:43.312 --> 38:46.848
but unfortunately, we've just now
located your current address.

38:48.482 --> 38:50.582
I regret to inform
you that your mother,

38:50.584 --> 38:52.384
Mary Catherine Sullivan,

38:52.386 --> 38:55.890
has passed on after
a long illness.

39:07.401 --> 39:08.838
I'm sorry, Bridget.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.684
Awful to hear of your
mother's passing, Maggie.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.089
Thank you, sir.

40:09.030 --> 40:11.667
It's... It's been quite...

40:20.908 --> 40:22.544
Mr. Borden.

40:24.979 --> 40:27.515
It's all right now, Maggie.

40:35.189 --> 40:37.425
It's all right, sweet girl.

42:17.258 --> 42:19.961
Shh, Maggie.

42:26.167 --> 42:28.838
Do what I say now, Maggie.

43:43.877 --> 43:46.180
Ah!

44:20.848 --> 44:23.049
You think if I leave...

44:23.051 --> 44:25.087
he'd give me a reference?

44:27.155 --> 44:29.221
Find me a new position?

44:29.223 --> 44:30.992
Is that what you think?

44:35.363 --> 44:39.198
Understand the weight that
your father's name carries.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.868
Understand it.

44:43.171 --> 44:45.671
- I do understand.
- You don't.

44:45.673 --> 44:47.406
Would you prefer I starve?

44:47.408 --> 44:49.944
You think I choose to be here?

45:17.972 --> 45:19.408
Lizzie.

45:23.944 --> 45:26.979
Things come out
worse than I mean.

45:26.981 --> 45:28.350
A lot.

45:29.484 --> 45:30.853
No.

45:34.388 --> 45:36.124
I'm sorry.

45:48.102 --> 45:50.438
I'm sorry this is
happening to you.

45:55.510 --> 45:57.845
I'm ashamed to be his daughter.

46:00.814 --> 46:03.251
I've been lying to
myself for so long now.

46:06.787 --> 46:09.221
Telling myself...

46:09.223 --> 46:11.426
that things will get better.

46:14.328 --> 46:16.397
But it won't, will it?

46:19.367 --> 46:21.035
Not ever.

46:35.783 --> 46:37.785
Why are you kind to me?

48:48.615 --> 48:49.649
Lizzie?

48:52.553 --> 48:53.653
I'm here, Emma.

49:28.990 --> 49:32.058
Look at the handwriting.

49:32.060 --> 49:35.364
It matches a contract
I found in father's office.

49:42.035 --> 49:44.136
We can't be certain.

49:44.138 --> 49:46.504
I saw him, Emma.

49:46.506 --> 49:48.609
How could father not see it?

49:49.977 --> 49:52.011
He would never believe it.

49:52.013 --> 49:54.113
He's blinded by
their partnership.

49:54.115 --> 49:56.982
Uncle John is playing
on father's fear.

49:56.984 --> 50:01.453
He's manipulating father into
signing over our inheritance, Emma.

50:01.455 --> 50:05.091
Well, whatever you do,
don't provoke John.

50:05.093 --> 50:07.759
He's not like the rest of us.

50:07.761 --> 50:09.562
You're wrong.

50:09.564 --> 50:12.600
He's desperate.
He has no place left to go.

50:14.502 --> 50:17.303
He's exactly like us.

50:33.521 --> 50:35.289
Out on the town?

50:43.798 --> 50:46.234
Never picked you
for a night bird.

50:52.707 --> 50:55.040
You really expected
to get away with this?

50:55.042 --> 50:57.109
Well?

50:57.111 --> 50:59.779
You don't even have enough
courage to admit it to my face.

50:59.781 --> 51:01.180
Do you?

51:01.182 --> 51:04.082
Oh, don't play games, Lizzie.

51:04.084 --> 51:08.187
I thought we could discuss this matter
candidly, but perhaps I was wrong.

51:08.189 --> 51:11.390
Discuss what, exactly?

51:11.392 --> 51:13.725
These letters are
written in your hand.

51:13.727 --> 51:15.828
I don't think anyone
would dispute that.

51:15.830 --> 51:18.734
I'm not gonna warn
you more than once.

51:19.801 --> 51:22.167
I'm not my father.

51:22.169 --> 51:25.837
- You can't scare me into needing you.
- No.

51:25.839 --> 51:27.508
Oh.

51:30.211 --> 51:33.412
You think pretty highly
of yourself, don't you?

51:33.414 --> 51:35.751
Yeah? Listen to me.

51:37.285 --> 51:39.752
You're just another girl,

51:39.754 --> 51:42.087
past ripe,

51:42.089 --> 51:43.555
who thinks that she's...

51:43.557 --> 51:44.823
too special

51:44.825 --> 51:47.225
for this world.

51:47.227 --> 51:51.263
Nobody understands what's
in your heart, is that it?

51:51.265 --> 51:53.402
Well, I understand you, Lizzie.

51:55.336 --> 51:57.136
I understand you.

51:57.138 --> 51:59.305
You're nothing to no one.

51:59.307 --> 52:02.508
You never were, never will be.

52:02.510 --> 52:04.310
It's you that doesn't know me.

52:05.713 --> 52:09.647
You hear? And that's
how you wanna keep it.

52:09.649 --> 52:12.218
I promise you.

52:12.220 --> 52:13.522
Lizzie.

52:26.600 --> 52:29.370
All this exertion has
made me a little thirsty.

52:31.539 --> 52:33.374
Good night, ladies.

52:52.693 --> 52:54.629
I'm fine, Bridget.

53:35.535 --> 53:37.606
Don't worry about Mr. Morse.

53:38.705 --> 53:39.971
He left this morning.

53:39.973 --> 53:42.443
Early. First light.

53:43.510 --> 53:45.446
Not even a word to your father.

54:00.961 --> 54:03.395
I appreciate what you did.

54:03.397 --> 54:05.600
I didn't do anything.

54:08.769 --> 54:11.272
Don't make me leave this room.

54:15.943 --> 54:17.379
No.

54:56.984 --> 54:59.285
You're home early.

54:59.287 --> 55:00.752
I, uh...

55:00.754 --> 55:03.325
thought I'd have
lunch with you today.

55:04.392 --> 55:05.594
Where's Maggie?

55:07.028 --> 55:09.863
Her afternoons are her own.

55:12.932 --> 55:14.268
Maggie?

55:15.970 --> 55:21.939
Do you have a shirt
in urgent need of mending?

55:21.941 --> 55:24.378
Or some silver
you'd like polished?

55:26.414 --> 55:30.783
I am... continually astonished

55:30.785 --> 55:35.323
at the endless number of ways you find
to humiliate yourself in this family.

58:15.850 --> 58:18.750
Nothing but an Irish whore,
aren't ya?

58:18.752 --> 58:20.718
Say it.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.523
Say it!

58:24.191 --> 58:26.093
I'm an Irish whore.

58:38.238 --> 58:41.708
I don't want you
spending time with Maggie.

58:42.910 --> 58:45.176
What?

58:45.178 --> 58:49.548
I don't you tutoring Maggie, I don't
want you going on outings with Maggie,

58:49.550 --> 58:51.549
I don't you speaking to Maggie

58:51.551 --> 58:54.252
on any terms but those appropriate
to Lady and housemaid.

58:54.254 --> 58:56.721
Am I clear?

58:56.723 --> 58:58.524
Bridget is my friend.

58:58.526 --> 59:00.091
No, you are mistaken.

59:00.093 --> 59:02.294
She's your servant.

59:02.296 --> 59:04.729
In any case,
it makes no difference.

59:04.731 --> 59:07.835
I'll be giving Maggie her
notice come September.

59:08.903 --> 59:10.836
On what grounds?

59:10.838 --> 59:13.939
I need no grounds.

59:13.941 --> 59:17.676
This attachment you've formed
is unhealthy, and it must end.

59:17.678 --> 59:20.848
Please don't force me to put
it any more bluntly than that.

59:23.584 --> 59:24.852
Say it.

59:26.319 --> 59:28.155
Say exactly what you mean.

59:31.591 --> 59:32.961
I wanna hear you say it.

59:36.597 --> 59:38.665
You're an abomination, Lizzie.

59:42.102 --> 59:44.973
And at last, we are on
equal footing, father.

01:00:08.662 --> 01:00:10.098
He won't forgive you.

01:00:12.066 --> 01:00:13.901
Not now.

01:00:15.368 --> 01:00:17.638
You watch how you speak to me.

01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:22.010
Why?

01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:27.981
It won't be long before
he sends you away.

01:00:34.622 --> 01:00:35.990
I'm afraid.

01:00:38.392 --> 01:00:40.995
I won't let anyone hurt you.

01:00:42.997 --> 01:00:44.765
You can't promise that.

01:00:48.002 --> 01:00:49.737
I will promise it.

01:00:50.838 --> 01:00:52.807
I will make good on it.

01:00:54.807 --> 01:00:56.243
Do you believe me?

01:01:00.881 --> 01:01:02.350
If you need my help,

01:01:03.417 --> 01:01:04.852
you have it.

01:01:09.756 --> 01:01:11.892
You must be certain
if you say that.

01:01:13.426 --> 01:01:15.229
No matter what the cost.

01:01:16.296 --> 01:01:17.665
I am.

01:03:43.877 --> 01:03:45.313
Bridget?

01:03:46.479 --> 01:03:48.782
Bridget, come quick!

01:03:50.017 --> 01:03:52.352
Somebody's killed father!

01:04:13.073 --> 01:04:15.777
Go for the police! Now!

01:04:19.046 --> 01:04:21.245
Bridget, go!

01:04:42.202 --> 01:04:45.807
To your knowledge, did
your father have any enemies?

01:04:55.214 --> 01:04:57.084
Shall I repeat the question?

01:04:59.019 --> 01:05:00.453
No, I heard you.

01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:04.158
Please answer.

01:05:05.993 --> 01:05:08.029
This is America, sir.

01:05:09.897 --> 01:05:12.366
Every man with
a pulse has enemies.

01:05:38.158 --> 01:05:41.091
Of course, there's a
will. I've seen it.

01:05:41.093 --> 01:05:45.263
Well, it's certainly not
in father's office or this house.

01:05:45.265 --> 01:05:47.432
Have you
contacted the attorney?

01:05:47.434 --> 01:05:50.669
Andrew Jennings is father's attorney,
and he knows nothing of a will.

01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:52.970
There must be another attorney.
An estate attorney.

01:05:52.972 --> 01:05:56.441
Well, I find that hard to
imagine. You knew father.

01:05:56.443 --> 01:06:00.712
Probably thought
he'd live forever.

01:06:00.714 --> 01:06:04.018
I suppose that's a mistake
we all make now, isn't it.

01:06:15.995 --> 01:06:19.196
We have young Miss Borden at the
house during the murder event.

01:06:19.198 --> 01:06:20.598
We have the murder weapon.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.201
You have a hatchet.
That is as much as can be said.

01:06:24.203 --> 01:06:27.504
We have a hatchet encrusted
with blood and hair.

01:06:27.506 --> 01:06:29.073
And we have motive.

01:06:29.075 --> 01:06:30.674
There's no motive.

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.343
On the contrary.

01:06:32.345 --> 01:06:34.712
As a result of this suddenly
untraceable will,

01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:37.448
you and your sister stand to inherit one
of the largest fortunes in New England.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:39.316
That is a vile insinuation.

01:06:39.318 --> 01:06:41.185
Emma,

01:06:41.187 --> 01:06:42.356
if...

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.626
Lizzie pleads guilty
to a lesser charge,

01:06:47.693 --> 01:06:50.028
A lesser charge?

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:51.696
What would that mean?

01:06:51.698 --> 01:06:53.163
It's up for discussion.

01:06:53.165 --> 01:06:55.033
Manslaughter?

01:06:55.035 --> 01:06:56.937
Involuntary manslaughter,
perhaps?

01:07:00.039 --> 01:07:02.406
And what of Maggie?

01:07:02.408 --> 01:07:04.508
Hmm?
She was here the whole time.

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.377
Is she accused of no crime?

01:07:06.379 --> 01:07:09.513
Several witnesses can place
Maggie outside washing windows

01:07:09.515 --> 01:07:11.649
at the time of your
step-mother's murder.

01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:14.252
And your uncle has an alibi.

01:07:14.254 --> 01:07:17.087
Your sister's whereabouts
are less clear.

01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:19.526
But my sister is innocent.

01:07:22.528 --> 01:07:24.698
There are no guarantees
here, of course,

01:07:25.765 --> 01:07:27.232
but she's a woman,

01:07:27.234 --> 01:07:29.033
she's from good home,

01:07:29.035 --> 01:07:32.005
and the judge may very
well be sympathetic.

01:07:33.073 --> 01:07:35.142
She will not plead guilty.

01:07:38.044 --> 01:07:39.479
Then, she will hang.

01:07:56.629 --> 01:07:58.265
Bridget, look at me.

01:08:12.812 --> 01:08:14.446
Lizzie.

01:08:14.448 --> 01:08:15.750
It's time.

01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:18.268
Lizzie Andrew Borden,

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.970
out of deference
to your family,

01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:22.540
and your long history
in this community,

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:25.977
I have ordered that these proceedings shall
remain closed to the public at large.

01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:29.380
I would ask that both the
prosecution and the defense

01:10:29.382 --> 01:10:33.550
refrain from discussing any details
from the case as it moves forward.

01:10:36.288 --> 01:10:39.456
Professor Wood,
you hold the chair of chemistry

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:42.460
at Harvard University,
do you not?

01:10:42.462 --> 01:10:44.761
Yes, I do.

01:10:44.763 --> 01:10:46.663
And...

01:10:46.665 --> 01:10:51.335
You... examined the hatchet in
question, did you not?

01:10:51.337 --> 01:10:52.970
Yes, I did.

01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:56.340
The police inspectors felt
there were suspicious stains

01:10:56.342 --> 01:11:00.444
and what appeared to be
human hair on the hatchet.

01:11:00.446 --> 01:11:02.013
And what did you find?

01:11:02.015 --> 01:11:05.015
All blood and hair samples
on the hatchet in question

01:11:05.017 --> 01:11:08.419
were found to be
animal in origin.

01:11:08.421 --> 01:11:10.921
Specifically, bird.

01:11:10.923 --> 01:11:13.327
Thank you, Professor Wood.

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.950
Fucking bitches.

01:11:53.533 --> 01:11:56.503
Your service here has not
been terminated, Maggie.

01:11:57.936 --> 01:12:00.804
I think it's best if
I find a new position.

01:12:00.806 --> 01:12:02.840
Simply won't allow it.

01:12:02.842 --> 01:12:06.544
And under the circumstances,
neither will the court.

01:12:06.546 --> 01:12:09.947
If anyone needs me, they can
find me at the Douglas.

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:12.019
- Excuse me...
- Make no mistake.

01:12:13.552 --> 01:12:16.754
If you let my sister
hang for this,

01:12:16.756 --> 01:12:20.461
I will haunt you for
the rest of your days.

01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:25.966
I wish you the best of luck.

01:12:27.499 --> 01:12:28.935
Excuse me.

01:13:07.473 --> 01:13:10.808
You must not be
completely broke yet, then.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:15.846
I was a little surprised not to see
my name on the visitor's list, but

01:13:15.848 --> 01:13:18.519
reason always prevails.

01:13:28.895 --> 01:13:32.966
I know a little something about
Massachusetts' estate law, you know?

01:13:40.739 --> 01:13:44.509
Abby Borden died 90 minutes
before your father.

01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:47.711
That's a pretty long time,
isn't it?

01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:51.014
That's time enough to be sure.

01:13:51.016 --> 01:13:52.885
Sure of what?

01:13:55.855 --> 01:14:00.127
If the husband dies before the
wife, the wife's family inherits.

01:14:02.762 --> 01:14:03.995
See,

01:14:03.997 --> 01:14:07.432
if your father
died before Abby,

01:14:07.434 --> 01:14:08.899
you get nothing.

01:14:08.901 --> 01:14:10.635
Abby's family inherits it all.

01:14:10.637 --> 01:14:12.202
But, if...

01:14:12.204 --> 01:14:15.740
Abby dies, and then, Andrew,

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:19.577
you inherit it all.

01:14:19.579 --> 01:14:25.015
So, the madman who committed these
crimes had my best interest at heart,

01:14:25.017 --> 01:14:26.850
is that your point?

01:14:26.852 --> 01:14:30.054
You think your Maggie's gonna
even last out the week?

01:14:30.056 --> 01:14:32.456
I don't get what's mine?

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:35.059
Don't you even think
of misjudging me,

01:14:35.061 --> 01:14:37.064
you cunt.

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.230
No, John.

01:14:40.232 --> 01:14:43.404
I believe it's you
who's misjudged me.

01:14:50.176 --> 01:14:53.577
I'm going to find that will.

01:14:53.579 --> 01:14:55.681
And you're gonna get nothing.

01:14:58.016 --> 01:15:00.153
But I already have it all.

01:15:01.687 --> 01:15:05.055
And money can buy
many things, John.

01:15:05.057 --> 01:15:07.694
As you know, a hungry man
is capable of anything.

01:15:09.495 --> 01:15:12.063
I'm not scared of you.

01:15:12.065 --> 01:15:13.834
Oh, but you are.

01:15:15.168 --> 01:15:16.570
I can see it.

01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:18.872
I can feel it.

01:15:20.006 --> 01:15:22.038
You'll never be safe.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.709
Not for one day.

01:15:24.711 --> 01:15:28.211
You're not even safe here,
now, in this room.

01:15:28.213 --> 01:15:32.215
If I were you, I'd
leave Fall River, John.

01:15:32.217 --> 01:15:34.520
I'd leave tonight,
and never look back.

01:15:35.721 --> 01:15:37.723
- You whore.
- Hey!

01:15:39.025 --> 01:15:41.559
It's all right, let him be.

01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:44.531
Old men and liquor
rarely mix well.

01:16:30.043 --> 01:16:33.978
<i>Please place your right
hand on the Bible before you.</i>

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.913
Do you swear before Almighty God
and all witnesses gathered here

01:16:36.915 --> 01:16:39.584
to tell the truth in all matters
pertaining to the murder

01:16:39.586 --> 01:16:41.786
of Andrew and Abby Borden?

01:16:41.788 --> 01:16:42.990
I do.

01:16:45.757 --> 01:16:47.793
Mr. Jennings.

01:16:52.364 --> 01:16:54.066
Miss Sullivan.

01:16:55.133 --> 01:16:57.001
The police have established

01:16:57.003 --> 01:17:01.272
the time of death for Abby Borden
to be approximately 9:30 a.m.,

01:17:01.274 --> 01:17:04.241
and the time of death
for Andrew Borden

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:07.580
to be approximately 11 a.m.

01:17:09.815 --> 01:17:12.685
Where were you at these times?

01:17:14.721 --> 01:17:18.121
Outside. Washing windows.

01:17:18.123 --> 01:17:20.760
And when did you come
in to take your rest?

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.362
After 11. Just as I finished.

01:17:25.364 --> 01:17:28.165
And between nine o'clock,

01:17:28.167 --> 01:17:30.303
and eleven o'clock,

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:34.307
Where was Miss Borden?

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:38.742
Um...

01:17:38.744 --> 01:17:40.346
Miss Emma was visiting friends.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.083
And Miss Lizzie?

01:17:53.693 --> 01:17:55.695
She was outside.

01:17:56.762 --> 01:17:58.763
All morning?

01:17:58.765 --> 01:18:00.167
All morning.

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:03.200
It was very hot,
if you remember.

01:18:03.202 --> 01:18:04.969
She was in the barn
for a while.

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:07.941
After that, she was
sat under a pear tree.

01:18:11.444 --> 01:18:13.678
Thank you, Miss Sullivan.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.149
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:18:17.249 --> 01:18:18.718
Mr. Moody.

01:18:20.319 --> 01:18:22.353
Miss Sullivan.

01:18:22.355 --> 01:18:26.057
You absolutely certain that Miss
Borden never left your sight?

01:18:26.059 --> 01:18:28.059
I am certain, yes.

01:18:28.061 --> 01:18:30.297
Were you not concentrated
on your work?

01:18:31.897 --> 01:18:34.898
I suppose so.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.233
Then, how would you be
absolutely certain that

01:18:36.235 --> 01:18:38.171
Miss Borden was
there the whole time?

01:18:41.841 --> 01:18:43.843
It's window washing, sir

01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:46.376
Meaning?

01:18:46.378 --> 01:18:48.746
It might be hard for
someone like yourself

01:18:48.748 --> 01:18:50.046
to concentrate on the job.

01:18:50.048 --> 01:18:52.082
But for me,

01:18:52.084 --> 01:18:54.350
scrubbing a pane of glass is as
easy as taking another breath.

01:18:54.352 --> 01:18:56.487
I would've noticed.

01:18:56.489 --> 01:18:58.354
She never left your sight?

01:18:58.356 --> 01:19:01.227
Even after you let
Mr. Borden into the house?

01:19:10.168 --> 01:19:12.103
I saw her then,

01:19:12.105 --> 01:19:14.441
just as I see her now.

01:19:30.823 --> 01:19:31.956
Yes.

01:19:33.391 --> 01:19:36.195
Five minutes,
Lizzie. That's all.

01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:49.976
Are you cold?

01:19:51.077 --> 01:19:52.378
I'm not.

01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:59.286
What was I to you?

01:20:05.024 --> 01:20:06.392
How can you ask that?

01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:09.328
I don't know you.

01:20:10.797 --> 01:20:12.399
I don't know who you are.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:20.240
Were you better off before?
Is that it?

01:20:22.007 --> 01:20:23.843
Is that what you think?

01:20:27.379 --> 01:20:29.449
What is it you want?

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.455
I want us to try.

01:20:41.092 --> 01:20:42.229
You're dreaming.

01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:44.897
You're just dreaming.

01:20:47.065 --> 01:20:49.301
You don't see it.
You can't see it.

01:20:50.403 --> 01:20:51.771
See what?

01:20:53.271 --> 01:20:55.339
We live in this world,

01:20:55.341 --> 01:20:57.110
and not another.

01:20:59.011 --> 01:21:01.080
This one right here.

01:21:03.315 --> 01:21:04.517
I know.

01:21:19.931 --> 01:21:23.002
Bring this to Mrs. Borden
at exactly 9 a.m.

01:21:24.971 --> 01:21:27.174
Tell her it came
from the Churchill's.

01:22:55.394 --> 01:22:57.564
This just came for you, miss.

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:07.103
Oh, no.

01:23:07.105 --> 01:23:09.238
I must get changed.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.343
Mrs. Churchill is ill.

01:24:10.101 --> 01:24:12.439
- Oh, God, no!
- Ah!

01:27:36.307 --> 01:27:38.675
I won't be kept
waiting outside my own house.

01:27:38.677 --> 01:27:40.547
Now, open the door!

01:28:01.967 --> 01:28:04.337
God dammit.

01:28:43.809 --> 01:28:45.979
Any mail for me today, father?

01:28:47.046 --> 01:28:49.281
No, not today.

01:28:50.582 --> 01:28:53.383
Would you like some soda water?

01:28:53.385 --> 01:28:54.887
Kind of you.

01:29:23.348 --> 01:29:25.584
I'm going outside
to pick some pears.

01:29:26.718 --> 01:29:28.320
Would you like one?

01:29:33.624 --> 01:29:35.560
I would not.

01:31:41.686 --> 01:31:43.189
Mr. Borden.

01:31:49.727 --> 01:31:50.893
Maggie.

01:31:50.895 --> 01:31:53.129
Mmm, ha!

01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:55.501
- Maggie. Put the hatchet down.
- No.

01:31:57.168 --> 01:31:59.736
Give me the hatchet.

01:31:59.738 --> 01:32:01.941
God dammit, Maggie,
give me the hatchet.

01:32:09.748 --> 01:32:12.051
She's having some
kind of attack.

01:32:19.024 --> 01:32:21.124
Lizzie.

01:33:21.019 --> 01:33:22.555
Bridget,

01:33:24.155 --> 01:33:25.824
go lie down, now.

01:33:56.221 --> 01:33:57.754
I'm sorry.

01:35:53.805 --> 01:35:55.841
Bridget!

01:35:56.941 --> 01:35:58.910
Bridget, come quick!

01:36:01.312 --> 01:36:03.449
Somebody's killed father!

01:36:23.534 --> 01:36:26.337
Go for the police! Now!

01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:32.078
Bridget, go!

01:36:45.957 --> 01:36:48.093
Just promise me something.

01:36:52.463 --> 01:36:54.165
Don't write to me.

01:36:57.235 --> 01:36:59.035
And don't look for me.

01:36:59.037 --> 01:37:00.205
No.

01:37:09.213 --> 01:37:12.048
I never wanted
anything from you.
